00:02.460 --> 00:04.129
ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Remain seated, please.</i>

00:04.212 --> 00:06.673
(in Spanish)
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

00:06.756 --> 00:08.758
(lively music)

00:11.386 --> 00:12.637
(elephants trumpeting)

00:18.518 --> 00:19.853
MAN 1: <i>The love of liberty.</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:21.479
(moans)

00:21.563 --> 00:22.689
(screams)

00:30.155 --> 00:33.324
NARRATOR:
<i>There's one thing that most people do</i>

00:33.408 --> 00:37.037
<i>more than anything during their day
at a Disney Park.</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:39.372
-Pirates of the Caribbean.
-NARRATOR: <i>No.</i>

00:39.456 --> 00:42.167
-I will spin wildly on those teacups.
-NARRATOR: <i>Fun, but no.</i>

00:42.250 --> 00:44.169
Big Thunder and Space Mountain
and Matterhorn.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.087
-NARRATOR: <i>Nope, nope, nope.</i>
-(screaming)

00:46.171 --> 00:48.465
The petrified rock
at the Rivers of America.

00:48.548 --> 00:49.591
-NARRATOR: <i>Uh...</i>
-(crickets chirping)

00:49.674 --> 00:51.009
That's the oldest attraction in the world.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.928
-NARRATOR: <i>No. It's none of those things.</i>
-I love the teacups.

00:54.012 --> 00:58.183
NARRATOR: <i>The one thing that everyone does
at a Disney Park</i>

00:58.266 --> 01:00.477
<i>is, quite simply, moving about.</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:05.065
<i>On an average day,
people walk about eight miles!</i>

01:05.148 --> 01:07.901
<i>There hasn't been that much
Disney-based exercise</i>

01:07.984 --> 01:10.153
<i>since... Mickey did Mousercise.</i>

01:10.236 --> 01:12.822
WOMAN: <i>Extend those calves. Holding...</i>

01:12.947 --> 01:15.992
NARRATOR: <i>Of course,
there is another way to move around.</i>

01:16.076 --> 01:19.079
<i>And Disney's huge fleet of vehicles,</i>

01:19.162 --> 01:22.624
<i>seen buzzing about the park
and soaring through the treetops,</i>

01:22.707 --> 01:25.335
<i>moves millions of people each year.</i>

01:25.418 --> 01:28.421
At Disneyland, transportation
is more like an attraction.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.341
That's your magic carpet ride
awaiting to take you places.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.594
-NARRATOR: <i>There are trains from the past.</i>
-Walt Disney loved trains.

01:34.677 --> 01:37.263
-NARRATOR: <i>And trains from the future.</i>
-(train horn honks)

01:37.347 --> 01:39.140
Who doesn't love the monorail?
It's amazing.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.226
NARRATOR: <i>And literal people movers.</i>

01:41.309 --> 01:44.562
Walt always wanted, you know,
to be a world on the move.

01:44.646 --> 01:47.107
At Walt Disney World Resort,
we're always dreaming,

01:47.190 --> 01:50.610
we're always creating,
exploring new ways to get around.

01:50.693 --> 01:53.613
SCOT: <i>Transportation is way more
than just wheels under you.</i>

01:53.696 --> 01:56.658
It really moves you
on the most emotional level.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.660
NARRATOR:
<i>From the high-horse-powered vehicles</i>

01:58.743 --> 02:00.995
<i>to the one-horse-powered ones,</i>

02:01.079 --> 02:04.290
<i>for Walt's ideas
to revolutionize transport</i>

02:04.374 --> 02:06.251
<i>in the parks and beyond?</i>

02:06.751 --> 02:09.504
<i>Well, the sky wasn't even the limit!</i>

02:09.587 --> 02:12.799
<i>Actually, yeah. Jet packs are the limit.</i>

02:12.882 --> 02:14.968
<i>Hey, come on back down!</i>

02:15.927 --> 02:17.011
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:17.095 --> 02:21.516
<i>Now, back on solid couch,
let us first contemplate</i>

02:21.599 --> 02:25.562
<i>the philosophy behind
Walt's vast fleet of vehicles.</i>

02:25.645 --> 02:29.357
<i>Because when it comes
to the metaphorical road to Disneyland,</i>

02:29.440 --> 02:32.527
<i>well, that was a path Walt Disney blazed</i>

02:32.610 --> 02:36.865
<i>as he constantly strived
to bring the inanimate to life.</i>

02:37.574 --> 02:42.162
<i>And this idea can be applied
not just to his animated characters,</i>

02:42.245 --> 02:44.205
<i>but to Disneyland itself!</i>

02:44.289 --> 02:48.168
The foot of Main Street,
about where you're sitting, is the plaza.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.837
When he designed Disneyland,
you know, from the hub outward,

02:50.920 --> 02:54.048
uh, each land had something moving in it

02:54.132 --> 02:56.676
to be that kinetic energy
to draw your attention from it.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.469
MIKE: <i>So, for example,
Tomorrowland had the Rocket Jets.</i>

02:58.553 --> 03:00.221
<i>Fantasyland had the carousel spinning.</i>

03:00.305 --> 03:03.224
And then, in Frontierland,
we had the Mark Twain paddleboat.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.603
And that paddle spinning
was that kinetic draw.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.398
NARRATOR: <i>But this story doesn't start
in the kinetic chaos</i>

03:10.481 --> 03:12.817
<i>of a living, breathing Disneyland.</i>

03:12.901 --> 03:17.322
<i>In fact, our story starts
where most people's day begins...</i>

03:17.405 --> 03:18.865
<i>-at the parking lot.</i>
-(horn honking)

03:18.948 --> 03:20.116
WALT: <i>It's off to Disneyland.</i>

03:20.200 --> 03:23.453
NARRATOR: <i>Where guests will board
the Disneyland tram.</i>

03:23.536 --> 03:24.579
When you get out of your car,

03:24.662 --> 03:27.457
it's not just trunching
to the ticket and transportation center.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.334
You're getting in a cool vehicle, right?
The tram.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.961
NARRATOR: <i>But, of course,
it isn't just any old tram.</i>

03:32.045 --> 03:33.755
It's... it's the first ride of the day.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.132
NARRATOR: <i>Whether you've come
to ride the rides, or...</i>

03:36.216 --> 03:37.842
-(car horn honks)
<i>-...just to catch a ride,</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:40.803
<i>there's no doubt that the Disneyland tram</i>

03:40.887 --> 03:43.348
<i>starts your day off
in the right direction.</i>

03:43.431 --> 03:45.683
When my daughter goes
to Disneyland with me,

03:45.767 --> 03:48.937
when she sees the tram,
she's ready for the day and ecstatic.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.063
And the day's already made.

03:50.146 --> 03:52.398
That's the first ride of the day,
is the tram.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.567
NARRATOR: <i>But certainly not the last.</i>

03:54.651 --> 03:59.781
<i>Because not long after you board
the natural gas-powered Disneyland tram...</i>

03:59.864 --> 04:02.575
Wow. Oh, uh... We're here.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.286
NARRATOR:
<i>Here being the front gates of the park,</i>

04:05.370 --> 04:09.249
<i>where you'll be greeted by one of the most
iconic sights of Disneyland.</i>

04:09.916 --> 04:13.419
<i>Nope, not the castle. Not the Matterhorn.</i>

04:13.503 --> 04:15.463
<i>-And definitely not... </i>
-Those teacups.

04:15.546 --> 04:20.510
NARRATOR: <i>Nope. You can't see any of that,
because your magical day at Disneyland</i>

04:20.593 --> 04:23.805
<i>-begins with... a train station.</i>
-(train bell dings)

04:23.888 --> 04:25.306
WALT: <i>The first sight to greet us</i>

04:25.390 --> 04:28.434
<i>is one of the famous
Disneyland trains of the 1860s.</i>

04:28.518 --> 04:33.106
NARRATOR: <i>And, as you excitedly line up,
strategizing your day,</i>

04:33.189 --> 04:38.861
<i>it's worth asking why a steam-powered
locomotive from the 1860s</i>

04:38.945 --> 04:44.033
<i>is the thing that Walt wanted you
to see first, above all else.</i>

04:44.117 --> 04:45.618
<i>And to find that out,</i>

04:45.702 --> 04:49.747
<i>we have to hop aboard
the express train of history</i>

04:49.831 --> 04:52.917
<i>by stowing away in an empty cargo carriage</i>

04:53.001 --> 04:56.754
<i>on a steam-powered
locomotive bound for Missouri,</i>

04:56.838 --> 04:59.716
<i>sometime during the early 20th century.</i>

04:59.799 --> 05:00.967
VANESSA: <i>Walt's love for trains</i>

05:01.050 --> 05:04.137
is something that came from him
being a child in the Midwest

05:04.220 --> 05:07.098
<i>and seeing the train
going through his hometown.</i>

05:08.599 --> 05:10.852
Him and his brother Roy would always
run out and see the train.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.478
NARRATOR: <i>And not just any old train...</i>

05:12.562 --> 05:14.605
They had an uncle who was an engineer.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.108
NARRATOR:
<i>Who was obviously not just any old uncle.</i>

05:17.191 --> 05:22.363
Both of them used to talk quite a lot
about the thrill of going down

05:22.447 --> 05:24.824
and standing there
by that great big locomotive,

05:24.907 --> 05:26.451
<i>and, you know, seeing their uncle.</i>

05:26.534 --> 05:27.577
NARRATOR: <i>And soon enough,</i>

05:27.660 --> 05:31.748
<i>Walt saw trains as the launching point
for an exciting future.</i>

05:31.831 --> 05:35.501
For him, it seemed like it was
the big adventure of going on a train.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.838
NARRATOR: <i>And Walt Disney's
final destination? Greatness!</i>

05:38.921 --> 05:42.508
<i>But his first stop
would be inventing Mickey Mouse.</i>

05:42.592 --> 05:45.803
There's the story of working on
and creating Mickey on the train,

05:45.887 --> 05:47.221
so, as he was headed out here.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.890
NARRATOR: <i>And one way or the other,</i>

05:48.973 --> 05:52.060
<i>this changed
the course of Walt Disney's life,</i>

05:52.143 --> 05:56.397
<i>-propelling him into fame, fortune, and...</i>
-Hello, friend.

05:56.481 --> 06:00.068
<i>...people's living rooms every week
and in the coming decades.</i>

06:00.151 --> 06:02.862
<i>With all the success Walt Disney enjoyed,</i>

06:02.945 --> 06:05.865
<i>he needed to find some kind of way
to let off...</i>

06:05.948 --> 06:07.241
-(train horn honks)
<i>-...steam.</i>

06:08.076 --> 06:11.496
Walt's physician said he needed a hobby.

06:11.579 --> 06:15.208
NARRATOR: <i>Ruling out the usual pastimes
of the late 1940s,</i>

06:15.291 --> 06:20.630
<i>it was once again a family member's love
of trains that inspired Walt.</i>

06:20.713 --> 06:24.425
<i>Only this time, he was the uncle.
And Walt's brother Roy?</i>

06:24.509 --> 06:26.803
<i>Well, his son was the nephew.</i>

06:26.886 --> 06:29.055
I was seven or eight
or nine years old, I think.

06:29.138 --> 06:32.475
My mother bought me a kit
to build a little freight car.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.770
And I very clearly remember
Walt coming by one time,

06:35.853 --> 06:39.023
and then looking at all this stuff,
and then kind of...

06:39.107 --> 06:41.651
NARRATOR:
<i>It was just what the doctor ordered.</i>

06:41.901 --> 06:46.072
He gave himself a present
of a little model train set.

06:46.155 --> 06:49.784
NARRATOR: <i>And with that, Walt Disney
had a lifelong hobby,</i>

06:49.867 --> 06:51.411
<i>where he could relax and tinker...</i>

06:51.494 --> 06:54.205
Not really.
That phase lasted about 15 minutes,

06:54.288 --> 06:57.375
and the next thing
was the live steam trains.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.669
-NARRATOR: <i>Live steam trains?</i>
-(train horn honks)

06:59.752 --> 07:03.881
NARRATOR: <i>But Walt lived in
the high-density suburbia of Los Angeles.</i>

07:03.965 --> 07:06.175
<i>So, he compromised. Slightly.</i>

07:06.259 --> 07:08.886
This was gonna be
a train you didn't ride in,

07:08.970 --> 07:10.138
but you rode on it.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.348
NARRATOR:
<i>Which, you won't be surprised to hear,</i>

07:12.432 --> 07:14.100
<i>wasn't something you could pick up</i>

07:14.183 --> 07:17.019
<i>at the local small,
rideable, model train shop.</i>

07:17.103 --> 07:19.856
<i>But don't worry.
Walt knew exactly which shop to call.</i>

07:20.815 --> 07:22.024
<i>In his own studio.</i>

07:24.402 --> 07:25.570
<i>One in particular.</i>

07:25.653 --> 07:29.574
My dad became known in the company
as someone who could build things.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.159
ROY: <i>And Walt he said,</i>

07:31.242 --> 07:36.664
"Roger, can you build a miniature
live steam train for our new home?"

07:36.747 --> 07:39.459
NARRATOR: <i>And to this,
there was really only one answer...</i>

07:39.542 --> 07:43.004
You say "yes." And then you figure out
later how you're gonna deliver.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.715
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, Walt was the conductor, after all,</i>

07:45.798 --> 07:47.925
<i>so, of course, everyone did what he asked.</i>

07:48.009 --> 07:52.847
<i>Except for one person.
That would be Lillian Disney, Walt's wife.</i>

07:52.930 --> 07:56.517
So, he took a copy of the design
of the track layout to show Lillian.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.103
NARRATOR:
<i>Pleading with the eyes of a man who...</i>

07:59.187 --> 08:03.191
<i>really wanted to build a small rideable
train in the backyard only could...</i>

08:03.274 --> 08:05.443
There was a lively discussion, because...

08:05.526 --> 08:08.321
He wanted the railroad to go in and out...

08:08.404 --> 08:11.908
NARRATOR: <i>That's right,
around and under Lillian's garden.</i>

08:19.540 --> 08:21.292
(laughs)

08:25.379 --> 08:26.506
NARRATOR: <i>Oh, it gets better.</i>

08:26.589 --> 08:30.176
HARPER: <i>Walt had wanted a curved tunnel
because when you go in a curved tunnel,</i>

08:30.259 --> 08:32.553
you don't see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.347
It's dark and it's frightening
to get on a little train,

08:34.430 --> 08:35.890
and suddenly,
you don't know where you are.

08:35.973 --> 08:39.185
<i>The contractor came up and he said,
"Mr. Disney, I'll go ahead</i>

08:39.268 --> 08:41.979
<i>and build your tunnel that way,
but let me explain something to you."</i>

08:42.271 --> 08:46.442
<i>"If you just straighten that tunnel out,
it'll save you an awful lot of money."</i>

08:46.526 --> 08:49.070
<i>Walt turned around
and he raised one eyebrow, and he said,</i>

08:49.153 --> 08:53.824
<i>"Mister, if I'd have wanted to save money,
you think I'd have been fooling around</i>

08:53.908 --> 08:55.952
<i>with an expensive miniature railroad?"</i>

08:57.954 --> 09:00.915
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, this expensive miniature railroad</i>

09:00.998 --> 09:04.126
<i>obviously, had Walt Disney's
name all over it.</i>

09:04.210 --> 09:06.295
<i>Except for the train itself,</i>

09:06.379 --> 09:09.131
<i>which he called "Lilly Belle,"
after his wife.</i>

09:09.215 --> 09:11.551
And I think, partially,
because she agreed...

09:11.634 --> 09:13.511
-NARRATOR: <i>In other words, she said...</i>
-Yes.

09:13.594 --> 09:18.558
<i>A word Walt himself would say to anyone
who wanted to ride his little train.</i>

09:18.641 --> 09:22.478
And he had this wonderful attitude
about wanting to share his toys.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.982
And he would take guests and friends
and family on this train all the time.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.067
I got to ride around on it a few times.

09:28.150 --> 09:31.988
And I remember sticking my foot down
accidentally one time

09:32.071 --> 09:34.448
<i>-and derailing the whole thing.</i>
-(train horn honks)

09:35.741 --> 09:39.495
I was in the doghouse, severely,
for a while after that.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.913
You're staying here.

09:40.997 --> 09:45.001
NARRATOR: <i>And now, finally,
Walt Disney had a lifelong hobby</i>

09:45.084 --> 09:46.460
<i>where he could relax and tinker</i>

09:46.544 --> 09:47.920
<i>-whenever he needed... </i>
-PAULA: <i>Of course...</i>

09:48.004 --> 09:52.508
"Why have a little train going around
my house when I can have a big train?"

09:52.592 --> 09:55.177
NARRATOR:
<i>You probably know where this is going...</i>

09:55.261 --> 09:57.847
-Right here, Disneyland.
-NARRATOR: <i>Yep. That's where.</i>

09:58.764 --> 10:01.100
DAVE: <i>When Walt was designing
Disneyland initially,</i>

10:01.183 --> 10:05.479
one of the first things he said he wanted
was a railroad around the entire park.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.981
And I guess if you're building
your own park,

10:07.064 --> 10:08.065
you can have your own railroad.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.735
WALT: <i>When you board one of these coaches
and circle the park</i>

10:10.818 --> 10:12.528
<i>on the three-quarter-mile trip,</i>

10:12.612 --> 10:15.364
<i>you'll have an old-fashioned
but easy-riding view</i>

10:15.448 --> 10:17.366
<i>of all four realms of Disneyland.</i>

10:17.700 --> 10:20.786
It was always gonna be about this train

10:20.870 --> 10:25.458
that was gonna wrap around his park
and kind of... hug it, nurture it.

10:25.541 --> 10:26.792
NARRATOT: <i>Aww, cute!</i>

10:26.876 --> 10:29.795
It actually defines
the shape of Disneyland.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.256
The purpose of it was for Walt to say,

10:32.340 --> 10:34.258
<i>"There'll be railroad station
at the entrance.</i>

10:34.342 --> 10:36.302
<i>You'll go underneath the railroad station.</i>

10:36.385 --> 10:38.095
<i>That's the way you'll get
into this place."</i>

10:38.179 --> 10:41.349
NARRATOR: <i>And it was the way the nation
got into the place, too,</i>

10:41.432 --> 10:45.102
<i>with the first moments of the Disneyland
opening day broadcast.</i>

10:45.186 --> 10:47.271
I'm standing here on the railroad tracks,

10:47.355 --> 10:51.734
with helicopters roaring overhead
and cars parking by the thousands.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.945
Now, if you look on down the track...
Hello, Walt!

10:56.489 --> 10:57.657
REPORTER: Hello, Governor!

10:57.740 --> 10:59.909
He was probably at his most excited

10:59.992 --> 11:03.329
when he got to take that train
around the park for the first time.

11:03.412 --> 11:07.208
I love that picture of him
with Mickey Mouse, going around the park.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.335
-How'd the run go?
-Oh, fine.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.836
NARRATOR: <i>And, in the coming years,</i>

11:10.920 --> 11:15.925
<i>millions of guests slipped inside
the warm embrace of the train tracks</i>

11:16.008 --> 11:19.637
<i>as you enter a world
filled with magic and fantasy.</i>

11:19.720 --> 11:23.599
<i>-But unlike all that magic and fantasy...</i>
-They're real-life steam engines.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.643
The newest ones, actually,
were built for the park.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.354
JASEN: <i>And the other ones are even older,
so they have a long history</i>

11:28.437 --> 11:29.522
and they were the real deal.

11:29.605 --> 11:33.025
WALT: <i>It's one of the famous
Disneyland trains of the 1860s.</i>

11:33.109 --> 11:37.154
I think you know, as a guest,
when, those trains pull into the station,

11:37.238 --> 11:38.906
that that's a real steam train.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.533
MARK: <i>And there's something visceral</i>

11:40.616 --> 11:43.202
<i>about the authenticity
of the steam trains.</i>

11:43.285 --> 11:47.665
It was not only a transportation device,
but it was a storytelling device.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.750
ZACH: <i>It was something
that anchored Main Street,</i>

11:49.834 --> 11:52.336
<i>but it also allowed you to journey
all the way around the park</i>

11:52.420 --> 11:55.339
<i>and see and get a kind of a glimpse
of each of these worlds</i>

11:55.423 --> 11:56.757
<i>that you could take part in.</i>

11:56.841 --> 12:00.344
NARRATOR: <i>With about six and half million
passengers per year,</i>

12:00.428 --> 12:04.932
<i>the Disneyland Railroad is one of the most
popular steam trains in the world.</i>

12:05.015 --> 12:09.061
<i>And, with a few updates
since that opening day in 1955,</i>

12:09.145 --> 12:10.771
<i>it's still chugging along!</i>

12:10.855 --> 12:15.776
<i>But these days, powered by biodiesel,
as it has been since the 2000s.</i>

12:15.860 --> 12:19.280
It operates just like diesel,
except it's less toxic,

12:19.363 --> 12:22.241
<i>it has fewer emissions, smells better.</i>

12:22.324 --> 12:25.035
BRUCE: <i>You can get the comments
from people riding around on the train.</i>

12:25.119 --> 12:26.829
Everyone notices
the difference in the smell.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.081
NARRATOR:
<i>And who could turn their nose up at that?</i>

12:29.165 --> 12:30.541
(train horn honks)

12:30.791 --> 12:33.627
NARRATOR: <i>But even as these old trains
move forward,</i>

12:33.711 --> 12:35.713
<i>there's always time to look back.</i>

12:35.796 --> 12:39.675
In the '70s, we added the Lilly Belle,
in honor of Lillian Disney.

12:39.759 --> 12:44.555
JASEN: <i>And it is a opulent experience.
Looks like turn-of-the-century, 1900.</i>

12:44.638 --> 12:47.683
There's carpeting in there,
and curtains, and plush seats.

12:47.767 --> 12:51.520
MARK: <i>And even the name "Lilly Belle"
ties back to his train he had at home.</i>

12:51.604 --> 12:53.898
<i>He never, I guess, saw it,
is what I heard.</i>

12:53.981 --> 12:56.525
But he always wanted
a special train car like that.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.986
JASEN: <i>I've definitely seen people cry.
They either didn't know it existed,</i>

12:59.069 --> 13:01.238
<i>or they'd heard about it,
or they thought it was a rumor.</i>

13:01.322 --> 13:04.742
But that car is a real special place
to be able to take guests.

13:04.825 --> 13:08.454
It's just a short trip
on the Disneyland Santa Fe Railroad.

13:08.537 --> 13:12.750
NARRATOR: <i>For as important as these
historic trains were to Walt Disney,</i>

13:12.833 --> 13:17.505
<i>guests might be forgiven for,
shall we say, missing the train.</i>

13:17.588 --> 13:21.091
<i>As they enter Disneyland
under those train tracks...</i>

13:21.175 --> 13:23.803
When you walk through those tunnels
and you step onto Main Street,

13:23.886 --> 13:25.387
<i>you're immersed for the first time.</i>

13:25.471 --> 13:29.433
NARRATOR: <i>Immersed in the sights
and sounds of Main Street, USA,</i>

13:29.517 --> 13:32.394
<i>the entry point to all of Disneyland.</i>

13:32.478 --> 13:38.192
<i>A hustling bustle full of life and idyllic
childhood memories for Walt.</i>

13:38.275 --> 13:44.240
Main Street is an idealized version
of how Walt remembers his hometown.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.951
NARRATOR: <i>Looking around Main Street, USA,</i>

13:47.034 --> 13:51.413
<i>you might wonder if Walt's focus
was purely a nostalgic one.</i>

13:51.497 --> 13:56.085
<i>However, it's the very inevitable act
of looking around</i>

13:56.168 --> 13:59.505
<i>-and feeling the tug of...</i>
-That kinetic draw.

13:59.588 --> 14:03.592
<i>...that probably won't keep you
in Main Street for too long, because...</i>

14:03.676 --> 14:06.804
Off in the distance,
there's a medieval castle.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.098
NARRATOR:
<i>Yeah, you might want to get down there.</i>

14:09.181 --> 14:13.561
<i>Which is when you realize that you could
either walk down Main Street,</i>

14:13.644 --> 14:16.438
<i>or take a trip down memory lane,</i>

14:16.522 --> 14:19.483
<i>in a historically accurate order,
if you fancy!</i>

14:19.567 --> 14:21.986
With Main Street
having horse-drawn streetcars

14:22.444 --> 14:24.446
<i>to kind of show people
this is where it started.</i>

14:24.822 --> 14:28.033
Then it moved
to turn-of-the-century-style vehicles.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.745
MIKE: <i>We had a little jitney car,
a double-decker bus,</i>

14:31.829 --> 14:35.124
<i>uh, a fire engine that looked like a,
you know, 1900s fire engine.</i>

14:35.416 --> 14:37.209
Oftentimes on Friday or Saturday,

14:37.293 --> 14:40.880
<i>you'd see the firetruck
driving all around, and it'd be Walt.</i>

14:41.297 --> 14:45.301
And he'd be playing the role
of being a delivery man on the trucks.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.888
NARRATOR: <i>However you decide to make
your way down Main Street...</i>

14:48.971 --> 14:50.598
You're joining Walt, very interestingly,

14:50.681 --> 14:54.059
on, like, this journey from childhood
towards his aspirational future.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.605
-NARRATOR: <i>Aspirational future?</i>
-What was, what is, what could be...

14:57.688 --> 15:00.190
NARRATOR: <i>How's he still up there?
Hey, I said come back.</i>

15:00.274 --> 15:02.735
Like, it's just kind of a timeline
in real-time.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.613
NARRATOR: <i>And when you get to the end
of Main Street,</i>

15:05.696 --> 15:08.532
<i>and stand at the hub
in front of the castle,</i>

15:08.616 --> 15:11.201
<i>and peer into the future
at Tomorrowland...</i>

15:11.285 --> 15:13.579
MIKE: <i>You see a PeopleMover,
and you see a monorail.</i>

15:13.662 --> 15:16.165
NARRATOR: <i>You might wonder,
"Why not just get some more horses?"</i>

15:16.248 --> 15:17.791
-(horse neighs)
-NARRATOR: <i>Well...</i>

15:17.875 --> 15:22.421
Even in the earliest Herb Ryman
1953 rendering of Disneyland,

15:22.504 --> 15:24.882
there's a monorail present
in Tomorrowland.

15:24.965 --> 15:28.302
VANESSA: <i>It's tiny,
it's a different design, but it's there.</i>

15:28.385 --> 15:30.888
NARRATOR: <i>But on opening day
at Disneyland,</i>

15:30.971 --> 15:33.057
<i>unlike the castle, the teacups...</i>

15:33.140 --> 15:34.683
-I love the teacups.
-NARRATOR: <i>We know.</i>

15:34.767 --> 15:38.437
<i>...and the train, obviously,
the monorail wasn't there. In fact...</i>

15:38.520 --> 15:41.607
WALT: <i>Disneyland's Monorail System
was a first in America.</i>

15:41.690 --> 15:42.816
NARRATOR: <i>That's right.</i>

15:42.900 --> 15:46.695
<i>The first in America.
So, where did Walt get the idea?</i>

15:46.779 --> 15:49.657
<i>Well, actually the same place
that inspired this</i>

15:50.032 --> 15:52.826
<i>and many of his favorite fairy tales.</i>

15:52.910 --> 15:55.663
He and Lilly are driving along
in a car in Germany,

15:55.746 --> 15:57.706
and just at the moment,

15:57.790 --> 16:00.793
uh, a monorail car drives
from one side of the road

16:00.876 --> 16:03.671
<i>to the other side of the road
through the trees, and Walt sees it.</i>

16:04.129 --> 16:06.173
BOB: <i>And he stops and chases the monorail</i>

16:06.256 --> 16:09.677
over to a service yard
where nobody speaks English.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.596
They send him back across the road
to the administration building,

16:12.680 --> 16:16.976
and Walt now walks into the front door
of a company that builds monorails.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.645
NARRATOR:
<i>Yeah, but what kind of monorails?</i>

16:19.728 --> 16:21.981
The German trains were so ugly.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.441
It was just a box
that kinda rode on a beam,

16:24.525 --> 16:27.027
and it wasn't particularly exciting.

16:27.736 --> 16:30.823
NARRATOR: <i>However,
Walt Disney could see something</i>

16:30.906 --> 16:33.450
<i>far more exciting than a dangling box</i>

16:33.534 --> 16:37.413
<i>with a slot in its bottom
moving about the German forest.</i>

16:37.496 --> 16:41.041
<i>He saw something bigger
than even Disneyland itself.</i>

16:41.125 --> 16:42.126
(train horn honks)

16:42.209 --> 16:45.254
It is not impractical to believe
that such a monorail system

16:45.921 --> 16:49.466
could well be the answer to the growing
traffic congestion in our cities.

16:49.550 --> 16:53.137
NARRATOR: <i>But, just like that time
he tried to dig up Lillian's flowers,</i>

16:53.220 --> 16:55.514
<i>Walt started in his own backyard.</i>

16:55.597 --> 16:58.434
<i>Except this time,
his backyard was Disneyland.</i>

16:58.517 --> 17:02.271
He financed, with his money,
the monorail and steam train.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.149
NARRATOR: <i>So, with his personal investment
on the line...</i>

17:05.232 --> 17:09.987
Walt asked Bob to take
that monorail and style it.

17:10.070 --> 17:14.241
NARRATOR: <i>That'd be Bob Gurr,
master of all things that move.</i>

17:14.324 --> 17:16.994
<i>By this point, Bob had designed Autopia,</i>

17:17.077 --> 17:20.080
<i>the Submarine Voyage,
and the Matterhorn Bobsleds.</i>

17:20.164 --> 17:22.499
<i>So, when Walt asked,
of course, Bob said...</i>

17:22.583 --> 17:24.293
-Yes.
<i>-So then, Walt said...</i>

17:24.376 --> 17:26.295
"I'd like to have you get started

17:26.378 --> 17:28.380
and see if you can figure out
how we could do this."

17:28.464 --> 17:31.008
NARRATOR: <i>To which he almost
definitely didn't say...</i>

17:31.091 --> 17:32.551
I'm a theme park maniac.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.387
And crazy like a fox.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.849
-See, I forgot my line already. See?
-(man laughs)

17:38.932 --> 17:40.559
NARRATOR:
<i>But one thing he didn't forget...</i>

17:40.642 --> 17:43.020
And I can remember sitting
on my kitchen table

17:43.103 --> 17:46.398
one Saturday morning, thinking,
"How am I gonna hide the beam way

17:46.482 --> 17:48.942
with a... like a slot
in the bottom of the train?"

17:49.026 --> 17:52.071
And I remember the old
<i>Buck Rogers</i> rocket ship of the '30s

17:52.154 --> 17:53.781
that had the pointed front,

17:53.864 --> 17:57.242
and had the two fans acting
like sled runners down the side.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.536
And I thought, "that would hide the beam,"

17:59.620 --> 18:02.122
and the train will look pointy
and really neat-looking.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.250
This ship's at least a hundred years
ahead of anything I ever saw.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.753
BOB: <i>I sketched that up,
made an illustration of it.</i>

18:07.836 --> 18:09.379
Walt took one look at that thing,

18:09.463 --> 18:11.423
<i>tapped on it and said,
"Bobby, can you build that?"</i>

18:11.507 --> 18:14.093
NARRATOR:
<i>And, as one does when Walt Disney asks...</i>

18:14.176 --> 18:15.803
And stupidly, I said "yes."

18:15.886 --> 18:17.054
NARRATOR: <i>And as seen here</i>

18:17.179 --> 18:20.224
<i>in this extremely accurate example
of Bob hard at work...</i>

18:20.307 --> 18:21.850
This is crazy stuff! Ooh...

18:21.934 --> 18:25.938
NARRATOR: <i>The man had a one-track mind,
otherwise known as monorail brain.</i>

18:26.021 --> 18:29.108
I had drawn some parts
that were almost impossible to build.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.360
The part that was the hardest
was the molding

18:31.443 --> 18:32.903
that went around the top of the windshield

18:32.986 --> 18:35.697
<i>because it was a very twisted
compound piece of aluminum.</i>

18:35.781 --> 18:37.574
And I had to go out
to the sheet metal shop

18:37.658 --> 18:39.368
<i>to get that thing built during the night.</i>

18:39.451 --> 18:40.577
BOB: <i>And we got one built.</i>

18:40.661 --> 18:44.373
And I says, "Okay, we need three more."
So, that's how you get stuff done.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.291
NARRATOR: <i>Yep, as easy as that.</i>

18:46.375 --> 18:49.920
<i>And, thanks to the tireless work
of Disney Imagineers,</i>

18:50.003 --> 18:55.551
<i>the Disneyland Monorail embarked
on its maiden voyage in June 1959.</i>

18:55.634 --> 18:58.929
It's the first operating monorail
in the western hemisphere.

18:59.012 --> 19:02.558
To be the first one to have a monorail
in the United States

19:02.641 --> 19:04.393
<i>was really exciting for him.</i>

19:04.476 --> 19:07.688
NARRATOR: <i>But don't forget,
Walt had big plans for this monorail.</i>

19:07.771 --> 19:11.316
Walt writes a letter entitled,
"Dear Dick Nixon."

19:11.775 --> 19:13.402
BOB: <i>"Would you mind coming
to Disneyland?"</i>

19:13.485 --> 19:16.113
And then he had the reason
to come to Disneyland

19:16.196 --> 19:19.658
is gonna show the new
Disneyland Monorail System,

19:19.741 --> 19:22.703
which could help
transportation problems of America.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.788
And the vice president, Richard Nixon,

19:24.872 --> 19:27.291
and his family came
for the ribbon cutting,

19:27.374 --> 19:30.419
you know, with Walt,
which is very historical.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.588
This has really been
one of the most exciting

19:32.671 --> 19:36.049
and interesting days
that I've ever had in my life.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.594
NARRATOR: <i>There'd be a few more
interesting ones to come.</i>

19:38.677 --> 19:42.389
<i>In any case, having such an important
guest at the grand opening,</i>

19:42.472 --> 19:44.600
<i>they must have used safety scissors.</i>

19:44.683 --> 19:46.768
(drumrolls)

20:03.327 --> 20:05.746
NARRATOR:
<i>But the difficulties of that ribbon gate</i>

20:05.829 --> 20:08.707
<i>were just the start
of their presidential problems.</i>

20:08.790 --> 20:11.877
In the morning, here comes Walt and
the Vice President of the United States

20:11.960 --> 20:13.462
<i>and his wife and two little kids,</i>

20:13.545 --> 20:15.547
and Walt wants to show them
the inside of the train.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.716
It's a hot day.
We turned the air conditioner on...

20:17.799 --> 20:20.427
sit down inside the train... Guess what.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.221
Walt says, "Well, let's give them a ride."

20:22.554 --> 20:26.016
So, I drive off,
and Nixon lets out a big hoop

20:26.099 --> 20:28.852
<i>when he sees that all the Secret Service
are on the platform,</i>

20:28.936 --> 20:31.063
which means none of them are in the train.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.105
BOB: <i>I just was heartsick,</i>

20:32.189 --> 20:35.317
because I now knew I had just kidnapped
the Vice President of the United States.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.027
NARRATOR:
<i>And despite the fact that Bob's...</i>

20:37.110 --> 20:38.403
Crazy, like a fox.

20:38.487 --> 20:42.157
NARRATOR: <i>He eventually brought Nixon back
a couple of minutes later,</i>

20:42.241 --> 20:44.701
<i>because when it opened, it only had...</i>

20:44.785 --> 20:46.578
One station in Tomorrowland.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.748
And it left the station,
went around on this little loop,

20:49.831 --> 20:51.750
and came back to the station.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.294
NARRATOR:
<i>But it didn't stay a little loop for long.</i>

20:54.378 --> 20:58.340
RAY: <i>In 1961, they added probably
close to two miles of track.</i>

20:58.423 --> 21:02.010
WALT: <i>Not only is the Monorail System
an entertainment attraction,</i>

21:02.094 --> 21:05.764
<i>but its new extension links the park
with the Disneyland Hotel.</i>

21:05.847 --> 21:08.892
DONALD: <i>That was a critical
selling point of the hotel.</i>

21:08.976 --> 21:10.978
Almost all of their advertising literature

21:11.395 --> 21:15.565
<i>and brochures featured a picture
of the monorail leaving the hotel.</i>

21:15.649 --> 21:18.026
ANNOUNCER 2:
<i>All aboard for the Magic Kingdom.</i>

21:18.110 --> 21:19.987
<i>Next stop, Tomorrowland.</i>

21:20.070 --> 21:21.738
(train horn honks)

21:21.822 --> 21:25.492
Now, a direct connection
with the monorail to the park,

21:25.575 --> 21:29.579
you know, that was used extensively
in their advertising literature

21:29.663 --> 21:32.291
for a number of years after that.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.960
NARRATOR: <i>As the monorail gained steam,
not like that,</i>

21:35.043 --> 21:37.546
<i>it was clear that Walt was right again.</i>

21:37.629 --> 21:41.591
The monorail's extremely important
in terms of minimizing the number of buses

21:41.675 --> 21:44.469
that we have on our roads
and as well as the number of cars.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.513
Walt Disney always had it in his mind

21:46.596 --> 21:49.808
that this was not only
an attraction within Disneyland,

21:49.891 --> 21:53.729
but he saw it as a means
of transportation within cities

21:53.812 --> 21:56.106
to alleviate traffic problems.

21:56.189 --> 21:59.985
NARRATOR: <i>So, Walt got in his car
and drove through the dense,</i>

22:00.068 --> 22:04.114
<i>frustrating traffic
from Anaheim to Downtown LA</i>

22:04.197 --> 22:06.867
<i>to let them know there was a better way.</i>

22:06.950 --> 22:10.704
He pitched running a monorail
to LA in Orange County

22:10.787 --> 22:15.000
<i>as a transportation opportunity
to help with the congestion.</i>

22:15.083 --> 22:18.003
WALT: <i>In large cities where land
is at a premium,</i>

22:18.086 --> 22:21.965
<i>an aerial monorail system needs only
a narrow beam way supported by pylons.</i>

22:22.049 --> 22:24.676
He came to LA, and he, you know,
I think he talked to the mayor

22:24.760 --> 22:26.303
<i>and he said,
"You should look at these monorails."</i>

22:26.386 --> 22:29.389
-NARRATOR: <i>And even though...</i>
-Monorails are very expensive to build.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.391
NARRATOR: <i>Walt had the mayor's ear.</i>

22:31.475 --> 22:33.602
<i>But so did the very powerful</i>

22:33.685 --> 22:36.938
<i>and influential
Los Angeles Transit Lines Company.</i>

22:37.022 --> 22:39.691
<i>So, unsurprisingly, the mayor said...</i>

22:39.775 --> 22:41.151
"I don't know if we want monorails."

22:41.234 --> 22:45.322
NARRATOR: <i>And, in the words of the famed
science fiction novelist Ray Bradbury...</i>

22:45.405 --> 22:47.824
I had attended hearings, uh,

22:47.908 --> 22:52.120
about the monorail that the city council
and the Board of Supervisors,

22:52.204 --> 22:54.206
very stupidly, turned it all down.

22:54.289 --> 22:58.251
NARRATOR: <i>But Walt's grand vision
to reinvent America's mass transit systems</i>

22:58.335 --> 23:02.464
<i>didn't end there, because,
surprise, surprise, Walt had...</i>

23:02.547 --> 23:04.508
ANNOUNCER 3: <i>And the concept new
to the American city</i>

23:04.591 --> 23:06.051
<i>for shorter travel distances:</i>

23:06.134 --> 23:07.803
<i>the WEDway PeopleMover.</i>

23:07.886 --> 23:08.804
NARRATOR: <i>Sorry, which way?</i>

23:08.887 --> 23:10.806
WING: <i>The WEDway. W-E-D.</i>

23:10.889 --> 23:14.518
That's Walt's initials. Walt Elias Disney.

23:14.601 --> 23:17.938
And that is a...
Again, it's a new transportation system.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.231
NARRATOR: <i>Well, it would be,</i>

23:19.314 --> 23:23.360
<i>because obviously,
reinventing mass transit isn't cheap.</i>

23:24.027 --> 23:27.697
<i>But Walt got a kind of green light
in the early '60s</i>

23:27.781 --> 23:31.118
<i>that helped him keep
his revolutionary ideas on track.</i>

23:31.493 --> 23:34.079
<i>That's right. The good old World's Fair.</i>

23:34.162 --> 23:35.539
I think the New York World's Fair

23:35.622 --> 23:39.418
was a watershed for Disney
in a lot of ways.

23:39.501 --> 23:40.627
NARRATOR: <i>Like WEDways?</i>

23:40.710 --> 23:42.254
The PeopleMover came out of that

23:42.337 --> 23:45.215
because that's how
we powered the Ford cars,

23:45.298 --> 23:48.176
<i>and so, it was a lot of groundbreaking.</i>

23:48.260 --> 23:49.428
NARRATOR: <i>One of the exhibits</i>

23:49.511 --> 23:52.973
<i>Walt committed to moved
full-sized Ford Mustangs</i>

23:53.056 --> 23:56.893
<i>and other, less popular cars
on a journey through time itself.</i>

23:56.977 --> 23:58.645
When pinned down as to, well,

23:58.728 --> 24:00.814
Walt, how are you gonna move these cars,

24:00.897 --> 24:03.066
uh, when they're all gonna go
at different speeds,

24:03.150 --> 24:05.777
different turns, different-sized cars
with people in them?"

24:05.861 --> 24:08.447
He'd say, "Well, we're just
gonna move them

24:08.530 --> 24:11.616
like, uh, the booster brakes
in the Matterhorn."

24:11.700 --> 24:15.454
So, here was a curious thing that,
in the middle of a business discussion,

24:15.537 --> 24:18.165
Walt introduces a technical solution.

24:18.248 --> 24:21.710
BOB: <i>And it was just a continuously
rotating rubber-tired wheel assembly.</i>

24:21.793 --> 24:23.378
NARRATOR: <i>Simple but effective.</i>

24:23.462 --> 24:25.046
Okay, I love the PeopleMover, by the way.

24:25.130 --> 24:28.842
SCOT: <i>It's a different type of experience
than a Tron, or a Space Mountain,</i>

24:28.925 --> 24:30.469
or anything like that.

24:30.552 --> 24:31.678
It's definitely a lot slower.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.555
NARRATOR: <i>But that's kind of the point.</i>

24:33.638 --> 24:36.725
SCOT: <i>It's a casual stroll
through the park, right?</i>

24:36.808 --> 24:38.477
But you get to sit there
and appreciate it,

24:38.560 --> 24:42.105
and talk amongst your friends,
and look down on people,

24:42.189 --> 24:45.317
and see the park from different levels,
and cut through show boxes.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.903
NARRATOR: <i>Relaxing and convenient, yes.</i>

24:47.986 --> 24:49.488
<i>Clearly, by the end of the '60s,</i>

24:49.571 --> 24:52.949
<i>Walt had proven yet again
that his ideas were quite good.</i>

24:53.033 --> 24:54.159
Walt, a lot of times,

24:54.242 --> 24:57.078
would use Disneyland as almost,
like, the experimental place.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.372
NARRATOR: <i>And now,
with non-experimental versions</i>

24:59.456 --> 25:01.958
<i>of his WEDway and monorail in place,</i>

25:02.042 --> 25:05.795
<i>Walt was ready to take on the world,
albeit his own one...</i>

25:05.879 --> 25:08.924
<i>With the construction
of Walt Disney World in Florida.</i>

25:09.007 --> 25:12.385
Walt Disney World is spread out
over nearly 40 square miles.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.471
-And...
-We're the size of San Francisco.

25:14.554 --> 25:17.349
Uh, or twice the size
of the island of Manhattan.

25:17.432 --> 25:20.644
NARRATOR: <i>Suddenly, what started
as a trip down memory lane for Walt</i>

25:20.727 --> 25:23.813
<i>would need to become
absolutely essential infrastructure.</i>

25:23.897 --> 25:25.565
MIKE: <i>In Disneyland, transportation,</i>

25:25.649 --> 25:28.109
it was more of a showcase
of what could be.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.945
NARRATOR: <i>Ooh. This is ridiculous.</i>

25:30.028 --> 25:31.863
And then, when Walt Disney World opened,

25:31.947 --> 25:35.617
its sheer size necessitated
actually putting that into motion.

25:35.700 --> 25:39.287
NARRATOR: <i>But the motion in Walt's mind
wasn't going to let him settle</i>

25:39.371 --> 25:41.540
<i>on just upscaling Disneyland.</i>

25:41.915 --> 25:45.794
<i>Because if Walt couldn't build
a transport system for his home city,</i>

25:46.461 --> 25:51.466
<i>then he decided to just build his own city
to go along with Walt Disney World.</i>

25:52.384 --> 25:53.593
<i>Complete with...</i>

25:53.677 --> 25:55.387
WALT: <i>A vast armada of vehicles</i>

25:55.470 --> 25:57.806
<i>will continuously flow
through the heart of the community.</i>

25:57.889 --> 25:59.558
NARRATOR: <i>That's right, the community.</i>

25:59.641 --> 26:01.393
WALT: <i>Traveling below the pedestrian level</i>

26:01.476 --> 26:04.479
<i>on roadways reserved
for specific types of vehicles.</i>

26:04.563 --> 26:08.233
NARRATOR: <i>So, as always, Walt's ideas
were bigger than his backyard,</i>

26:08.316 --> 26:11.444
<i>because his vision wasn't just
to create a new theme park,</i>

26:11.528 --> 26:14.322
<i>but to create a working, living community.</i>

26:14.406 --> 26:17.409
He was full of ideas
on what that place would be like.

26:17.492 --> 26:18.660
It would not be just a park.

26:18.743 --> 26:21.037
It would be in the setting
of an urban experiment,

26:21.121 --> 26:26.585
where you could try to improve the control
of our frantic automobile existence.

26:26.668 --> 26:30.422
I believe we can build a community here
that more people will talk about

26:31.131 --> 26:34.467
and come to look at
than any other area in the world.

26:35.719 --> 26:39.723
I'm sure this Experimental
Prototype Community of Tomorrow

26:40.265 --> 26:44.144
can influence the future of city
living for generations to come.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.563
NARRATOR:
<i>But even the great Walt Disney himself</i>

26:46.646 --> 26:51.401
<i>had neither the money nor time
to complete Epcot and Walt Disney World</i>

26:51.484 --> 26:54.362
<i>before he passed away in 1966.</i>

26:54.446 --> 26:58.116
The original planning for Epcot
and the transportation system within it

26:58.575 --> 27:01.911
really kind of went away when Walt died.

27:01.995 --> 27:06.249
Uh, so, the course was changed
pretty dramatically from that point on.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.043
NARRATOR: <i>But all was not lost.</i>

27:08.126 --> 27:14.507
Walt Disney gave us a vision of a future
and something to aspire to.

27:14.841 --> 27:17.385
NARRATOR: <i>And with his brother Roy now
in the driver's seat,</i>

27:17.469 --> 27:19.804
<i>during the planning stages
of Walt Disney World,</i>

27:19.888 --> 27:24.017
<i>Roy made sure that Walt's idea
to revolutionize mass transit</i>

27:24.100 --> 27:25.602
<i>continued to take shape.</i>

27:25.977 --> 27:27.896
<i>An A-shape, to be specific.</i>

27:27.979 --> 27:32.776
The Contemporary Hotel with an A-frame,
it has a, you know, atrium space.

27:32.859 --> 27:35.904
NARRATOR: <i>"But how is the Contemporary's
shape relevant</i>

27:35.987 --> 27:38.031
<i>to the future of transport," you ask?</i>

27:38.114 --> 27:39.824
It's the only hotel on the planet

27:39.908 --> 27:41.951
with a monorail
going through the middle of it.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.536
NARRATOR: <i>That'd be how.</i>

27:43.620 --> 27:45.789
<i>And with that, it was all systems go</i>

27:45.872 --> 27:48.792
<i>for construction
of this revolutionary hotel,</i>

27:48.875 --> 27:51.586
<i>much of which was constructed off-site.</i>

27:52.379 --> 27:55.757
<i>And we're not talking
from the monorail factory down the road.</i>

27:55.840 --> 28:00.679
We're shipping monorail beams
from Tacoma, Washington to Florida.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.347
-(bell dings)
-ORLANDO: <i>Cross country.</i>

28:02.430 --> 28:05.725
<i>These things were 65-feet long.</i>

28:05.809 --> 28:09.854
They were so long
that they had to get three railroad cars,

28:10.146 --> 28:11.606
<i>in order to ship them.</i>

28:11.690 --> 28:14.776
The two ends were put on
the front car and the third car.

28:15.443 --> 28:17.112
The middle car was an idler.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.322
<i>So, that allowed them
to go around the corners.</i>

28:19.406 --> 28:22.659
They were going around the corners
someplace in the Midwest

28:22.742 --> 28:24.828
-and they just rolled that.
-(train horn honks)

28:26.287 --> 28:28.790
ORLANDO: <i>'Cause these things
weighed 20 tons. They were heavy.</i>

28:28.873 --> 28:31.459
They went around too fast,
I guess, and we lost one.

28:31.543 --> 28:36.589
NARRATOR: <i>Speaking of lost,
it's 1970s musical icon, Glen Campbell,</i>

28:36.673 --> 28:39.592
<i>coming to the grand opening
of Walt Disney World</i>

28:39.676 --> 28:42.971
<i>by way of the bushes,
under the monorail track.</i>

28:43.263 --> 28:46.307
<i>And in the grand opening
television broadcast, look!</i>

28:46.391 --> 28:49.185
<i>The monorail
was the first thing people saw.</i>

28:50.979 --> 28:53.565
From day one,
it was just a fabulous success.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.192
Uh, you know, people loved riding that.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.319
John Hench loved to tell a story.

28:58.403 --> 29:02.073
On opening day, he wanted to be
in the nose of the monorail

29:02.157 --> 29:05.618
with the first guests to just see
what their reaction would be.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.205
And it turned out,
they were from Akron, Ohio,

29:09.289 --> 29:12.917
which he thought was absolutely perfect,
just like dead center of the country.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.753
And they were all sort of chatting away.

29:14.836 --> 29:19.299
Once you approached the A-frame
and then were enveloped by it,

29:19.382 --> 29:21.885
<i>and you saw the beautiful
Grand Canyon Concourse,</i>

29:21.968 --> 29:24.137
<i>they stopped talking, their jaws dropped.</i>

29:24.220 --> 29:27.515
And they were totally silent,
the entire family,

29:27.599 --> 29:30.518
until they got all the way
to the Magic Kingdom,

29:30.602 --> 29:33.563
<i>processing the experience
that they had just gone through.</i>

29:33.646 --> 29:35.690
I can't even imagine
what an emotional moment

29:35.774 --> 29:38.777
that would have been,
to be the first people to experience it.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.695
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, they certainly weren't the last,</i>

29:40.779 --> 29:42.864
<i>especially because Walt Disney World</i>

29:42.947 --> 29:47.285
<i>would expand when Epcot
was finally constructed in 1982.</i>

29:47.368 --> 29:49.954
That will be linked
to the present Magic Kingdom

29:50.038 --> 29:51.414
-with a monorail system.
-(crowd applause)

29:51.498 --> 29:55.168
NARRATOR: <i>It was looking like
Walt's revolutionary transport idea</i>

29:55.251 --> 29:59.255
<i>was at least revolutionizing
40 square miles of Florida.</i>

29:59.339 --> 30:02.509
That's what's pretty amazing
about Florida,

30:02.592 --> 30:06.054
<i>is how many systems are in place
to move people where they wanna go.</i>

30:06.137 --> 30:08.389
Walt Disney World has a diverse fleet

30:08.473 --> 30:10.934
of all sorts
of different types of transportation,

30:11.017 --> 30:14.604
from monorails and buses,
and even ferries...

30:14.687 --> 30:16.022
-ROYAL ANNOUNCER: Fairies!
-NARRATOR: <i>Fairies?</i>

30:16.105 --> 30:17.273
-You mean...
-Ferry boats.

30:17.357 --> 30:20.109
-(ferry horn honks)
-NARRATOR: <i>Fairies make sense, at least,</i>

30:20.193 --> 30:22.570
<i>until you realize
that Walt Disney World has...</i>

30:22.654 --> 30:26.074
This big lagoon in front
of the Magic Kingdom.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.326
They knew from what
they had learned at Disneyland,

30:28.409 --> 30:30.119
that they were gonna have
to disperse the crowd,

30:30.203 --> 30:33.081
uh, and not just let them park
right up by the main entrance.

30:33.164 --> 30:35.625
MIKE: <i>And so, they made use
of this giant lagoon that we had.</i>

30:35.708 --> 30:36.876
<i>And so, the ferry boats,</i>

30:36.960 --> 30:39.712
they can carry, you know,
over 600 people at a time.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.464
And we have three of them, so...

30:41.881 --> 30:45.260
They're constantly in motion
and move a lot of people at one time.

30:45.552 --> 30:48.346
NARRATOR: <i>Every mode of transport
within the Disney Parks</i>

30:48.429 --> 30:50.682
<i>is a stunning sight to behold.</i>

30:50.765 --> 30:53.726
<i>And the Imagineers' commitment
to these iconic vehicles</i>

30:53.810 --> 30:56.521
<i>would, no doubt, make Walt very happy.</i>

30:56.896 --> 30:59.607
<i>However, he was always up for an update.</i>

30:59.691 --> 31:02.694
-WALT: <i>Disneyland will never be complete.</i>
-NARRATOR: <i>Exactly.</i>

31:02.777 --> 31:05.071
It was time to refurbish the monorail.

31:05.154 --> 31:07.198
And it was, like,
this perfect opportunity to,

31:07.282 --> 31:09.158
if we're gonna go in there
and touch it at all,

31:09.242 --> 31:11.202
let's give it a new look and feel.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.204
Me and... and Owen Yoshino...

31:13.288 --> 31:15.164
Oh, I'm Owen Yoshino.

31:15.248 --> 31:18.585
I come up with ideas
for new attractions and rides.

31:18.918 --> 31:21.087
SCOT: <i>So, we started doing
all these cool concepts</i>

31:21.170 --> 31:22.714
<i>and kind of challenging each other</i>

31:22.797 --> 31:26.009
to draw newer, different,
crazier monorail designs.

31:26.092 --> 31:28.094
He is a fantastic designer.

31:28.261 --> 31:31.097
NARRATOR: <i>But as they stared
into each other's designs...</i>

31:31.180 --> 31:33.558
But there was kind of a moment
where we stopped,

31:34.142 --> 31:39.272
and we realized the power of the legacy
of the very first monorail from 1959,

31:39.355 --> 31:42.317
and, kind of, that iconic look.
And we realized...

31:42.400 --> 31:45.778
It represents us as Imagineers
and as Disney, right?

31:45.862 --> 31:50.742
NARRATOR: <i>Right! So, maybe it turns out
that the monorail isn't futuristic,</i>

31:50.825 --> 31:53.745
<i>or a thing of the past.
It's kind of timeless.</i>

31:53.828 --> 31:57.373
And that's what really inspired us to dig
into what that looked like,

31:57.457 --> 31:59.500
and how we can bring that
to life in new ways,

31:59.584 --> 32:01.836
<i>and use new materials,
and new paint finishes.</i>

32:01.920 --> 32:03.880
NARRATOR: <i>But ultimately, it's not new,</i>

32:03.963 --> 32:07.050
<i>unlike the next
major transportation project</i>

32:07.133 --> 32:09.969
<i>that was kept under wraps
until it was introduced</i>

32:10.053 --> 32:13.056
<i>to Walt Disney World Resort in 2019.</i>

32:13.139 --> 32:17.185
JORDAN: <i>The Disney Skyliner connects
four resorts to two theme parks.</i>

32:17.268 --> 32:19.479
But now, we're all the way up in the sky,

32:19.562 --> 32:22.148
so we are literally
taking transportation to new heights.

32:22.231 --> 32:23.942
Guests were riding this thing
like an attraction.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.110
ZACH: <i>They're able to now get
and take in the property,</i>

32:26.194 --> 32:27.487
<i>and get a sense of the scale,</i>

32:27.570 --> 32:29.322
just like they would do
in one of our park experiences,

32:29.405 --> 32:30.990
which has been really fun to see.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.159
NARRATOR: <i>Walt Disney World, in many ways,</i>

32:33.242 --> 32:35.286
<i>is the realization of Walt's dream.</i>

32:35.370 --> 32:36.621
It could well be the answer

32:36.704 --> 32:38.998
to the growing traffic congestion
in our cities.

32:39.374 --> 32:43.002
Here at Walt Disney World,
we do operate very much like a small city.

32:43.086 --> 32:46.172
NARRATOR: <i>And he's not talking small
like Walt's hometown small.</i>

32:46.255 --> 32:48.466
We're actually comparable
to the city of Atlanta.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.426
MIKE: <i>We have a logistics team.</i>

32:50.510 --> 32:51.803
<i>We have management teams</i>

32:51.886 --> 32:54.597
<i>for our buses and monorails,
watercrafts, everything.</i>

32:54.681 --> 32:57.183
<i>And we're literally
moving millions a year.</i>

32:57.266 --> 33:00.353
NARRATOR: <i>It's highly likely that Walt
would be proud</i>

33:00.436 --> 33:03.648
<i>of the highly efficient transportation
of Walt Disney World.</i>

33:04.524 --> 33:06.651
<i>But where do we go from here?</i>

33:06.734 --> 33:08.987
<i>Well, that's up to today's Imagineers,</i>

33:09.070 --> 33:12.115
<i>who are, at least metaphorically,
in the driver's seat,</i>

33:12.198 --> 33:15.743
<i>steering Disney's transportation
fleet toward the future.</i>

33:16.160 --> 33:18.204
<i>And about being in the driver's seat...</i>

33:18.287 --> 33:20.456
That's one of the highs of my career,

33:20.540 --> 33:23.418
is getting to pilot the monorail
that I designed.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.795
That was like a wow moment.

33:25.878 --> 33:30.842
NARRATOR: <i>A moment more than likely shared
by its original designer, Bob Gurr.</i>

33:30.925 --> 33:34.470
One of the dumbest, most stupid
transportation systems ever conceived.

33:34.554 --> 33:35.763
(laughs)

33:35.847 --> 33:37.932
NARRATOR:
<i>And even though the City of Los Angeles...</i>

33:38.016 --> 33:40.768
-Very stupidly turned it all down.
-Crazy.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.563
NARRATOR:
<i>Today, monorails are being used in China,</i>

33:43.646 --> 33:47.108
<i>efficiently moving nearly
a million passengers a day.</i>

33:47.191 --> 33:52.363
<i>And although not quite as architecturally
spectacular as the Contemporary,</i>

33:52.447 --> 33:57.368
<i>the ability for the monorail to coexist
with an established infrastructure</i>

33:57.452 --> 34:00.872
<i>is as effective now
as Walt knew it could be.</i>

34:02.290 --> 34:06.377
<i>But revolutionizing mass transit
around the world, or not,</i>

34:06.461 --> 34:08.880
<i>from the start of his life to the end.</i>

34:08.963 --> 34:11.299
<i>One thing was certain, Walt Disney...</i>

34:11.382 --> 34:14.052
Loved vehicles.
Whether it was a PeopleMover,

34:14.135 --> 34:17.805
<i>whether it was a submarine,
whether it was an Autopia car,</i>

34:17.889 --> 34:20.725
he loved the idea of seeing things moving.

34:20.933 --> 34:23.019
NARRATOR:
<i>And since Disneyland's first day,</i>

34:23.102 --> 34:25.354
<i>it really hasn't stopped moving.</i>

34:25.438 --> 34:29.776
It gives life
to a seemingly inanimate place.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.319
Uh, and it just makes the whole place

34:31.402 --> 34:34.030
feel like you're in something
that's alive.

34:34.113 --> 34:38.242
NARRATOR: <i>Perhaps even a dream, that,
for Walt Disney, came alive.</i>

34:38.868 --> 34:40.995
A dream that grew into a reality.

34:41.329 --> 34:45.500
Walt Disney really
did engineer that train,

34:45.583 --> 34:46.918
really did drive that fire truck.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.337
NARRATOR: <i>And he really did
get up super early</i>

34:49.420 --> 34:50.755
<i>on Saturdays to do it.</i>

34:50.838 --> 34:53.049
TONY: <i>People that lead regular lives</i>

34:53.132 --> 34:55.718
think of why would they be doing
that at seven in the morning.

34:55.802 --> 34:59.722
NARRATOR: <i>Perhaps, the answer lies
with such regular-lifed people.</i>

34:59.806 --> 35:02.558
<i>One in particular,
his oldest brother Herbert.</i>

35:02.642 --> 35:05.686
WALT: <i>Who I really envied
because he was a mailman.</i>

35:06.437 --> 35:09.649
But he was the one that had all the fun.
He had himself a trailer.

35:09.732 --> 35:11.526
He drove the mail truck during the week,

35:11.609 --> 35:13.820
<i>and then they'd go fishing
in the camper over the weekend.</i>

35:13.903 --> 35:16.531
He didn't worry about payrolls,
and stories,

35:16.614 --> 35:19.742
and picture grosses, or anything.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.702
And he was the happy one.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.122
I... I always said,
"He's the smart Disney."

35:25.456 --> 35:28.459
So, on Saturday morning,
when there weren't guests in the park yet,

35:28.876 --> 35:30.711
getting to drive that truck around

35:30.795 --> 35:34.173
was probably the same
as riding Peter Pan to me.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.926
You know, it was like the dream
of something he,

35:37.009 --> 35:38.386
as Walt Disney, could never do.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.596
NARRATOR:
<i>From the beginning of his great journey,</i>

35:40.680 --> 35:43.516
<i>Walt Disney was on the move
to the very end.</i>

35:44.016 --> 35:48.729
TIM: <i>Walt Disney's last day at Disneyland
actually involved a photoshoot.</i>

35:49.272 --> 35:52.984
And he's in the fire truck
in front of the castle with Mickey.

35:53.067 --> 35:55.194
NARRATOR:
<i>As this immortal legend drives off</i>

35:55.278 --> 35:56.988
<i>into the sunset of history,</i>

35:57.071 --> 35:59.657
<i>it's obvious why Walt got up so early.</i>

35:59.740 --> 36:03.536
This was Walt's way of getting
to enjoy this incredible toy

36:03.619 --> 36:04.912
that he built for himself.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.040
NARRATOR: <i>Well, himself
and, as it's always been,</i>

36:08.124 --> 36:10.126
<i>anybody else who wanted a ride.</i>

36:10.209 --> 36:11.919
<i>And there are plenty who do.</i>

36:12.003 --> 36:14.797
The ADA requirements
to get a wheelchair in

36:14.881 --> 36:16.883
<i>was a huge engineering challenge.</i>

36:16.966 --> 36:19.260
RAY: <i>One night,
I was at California Adventure,</i>

36:19.343 --> 36:21.762
and there's a ten-year-old boy
on the wheelchair.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.391
And you could tell he'd been
in the wheelchair for his entire life.

36:25.683 --> 36:28.811
<i>He knew everything
about the Pacific Electric railroad.</i>

36:28.895 --> 36:31.522
<i>And he was so excited and enthusiastic.</i>

36:32.273 --> 36:34.358
And they put the conductor's cap on him.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.445
He blew the whistle.
He was ringing the bell.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.739
The windows were open in the front.

36:39.822 --> 36:44.869
His mom was out in front, taking pictures
with tears streaming down her face.

36:45.411 --> 36:46.454
<i>And I was crying.</i>

36:46.537 --> 36:50.208
<i>Because I thought that's why,
as Imagineers, we do the stuff that we do.</i>

36:50.291 --> 36:54.128
<i>It's for our guests
and for people to be supported</i>

36:54.212 --> 36:56.297
<i>and loved through their experience.</i>

36:56.380 --> 37:01.469
That probably was the most meaningful,
important day of my life in Imagineering.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.430
We at Imagineering have continued
that legacy

37:04.513 --> 37:07.433
<i>of thinking about
what they mean for the guests</i>

37:07.516 --> 37:10.645
in terms of this sense of adventure
that's gonna take you to these new places

37:10.728 --> 37:13.189
that I think we use as a jumping-off point
to tell new stories.

37:13.272 --> 37:16.067
NARRATOR: <i>And so, the stories
and adventures continue.</i>

37:16.150 --> 37:20.488
<i>From the brilliance of Walt Disney,
to the creativity of the Imagineers,</i>

37:20.571 --> 37:23.824
<i>to the Disney cast members
who keep the fleet moving...</i>

37:23.908 --> 37:24.909
They're the real deal.

37:24.992 --> 37:28.996
<i>...who continue to transport
millions of children and adults alike</i>

37:29.080 --> 37:31.540
<i>on an exploration like no other.</i>

37:31.624 --> 37:34.627
NARRATOR: <i>And for those waiting
to start their own journey...</i>

37:34.710 --> 37:36.295
(train horn honks)

37:36.379 --> 37:38.130
MAN 2: <i>All aboard!</i>

37:38.756 --> 37:40.758
(lively music)
