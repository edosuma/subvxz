WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.736
Previously on Legacies...
We need to learn more

00:02.736 --> 00:05.038
about Landon's past.
Who are your parents?

00:05.038 --> 00:06.440
My mom's name is Seylah.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.574
Pretty much all I know.

00:07.574 --> 00:09.376
She gave me up
for adoption when I was young.

00:09.376 --> 00:10.978
HOPE: If we can't figure out
what you are,

00:10.978 --> 00:13.013
then you can't stay
at the school.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.815
What is this?
If you ever need me,

00:14.815 --> 00:16.416
just press it,
and my bracelet

00:16.416 --> 00:17.484
will lead me to you.

00:17.484 --> 00:20.187
Is that your way of admitting
you care about me?

00:20.187 --> 00:22.189
HOPE: I'm assuming
you know this symbol.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.325
It is the sign of the worst
existential nightmare.

00:25.325 --> 00:26.426
Malivore.

00:26.426 --> 00:29.129
If I return the knife
to Malivore, I will be free.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.132
The knife is destroyed.

00:32.132 --> 00:34.067
One lock is released,

00:34.067 --> 00:36.103
and so am I.

00:36.103 --> 00:38.872
ALARIC: That thing
is a master manipulator.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.474
Look, I am trying
to protect you.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.976
Don't you dare play
disappointed dad

00:42.976 --> 00:44.478
because you are
not my father.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.346
What's wrong?

00:47.481 --> 00:49.349
Landon's in trouble.

01:04.264 --> 01:07.768
HOPE: There's something
I need to tell you.

01:09.536 --> 01:12.072
I just don't know how.

01:14.975 --> 01:17.244
So, to make you understand,

01:17.244 --> 01:19.079
maybe I should start
from the end.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.081
Where the hell are we?

01:21.081 --> 01:25.018
What happened?
I don't know.

01:25.018 --> 01:28.755
But I don't think we're
in Kansas anymore.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.702
HOPE:
On second thought,

01:41.702 --> 01:44.504
I'll just start
at the beginning.

01:44.504 --> 01:47.641
I know Landon needed me,

01:47.641 --> 01:50.410
and at the time,
that's all I needed to know.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.512
(snoring)

02:09.229 --> 02:10.797
Going somewhere?

02:13.400 --> 02:16.670
Better questions,

02:16.670 --> 02:19.272
where the hell do you think
you're going with my keys

02:19.272 --> 02:20.507
and without telling me?

02:20.507 --> 02:22.809
Um, you know,

02:22.809 --> 02:26.313
I just said some really harsh
things to you yesterday,

02:26.313 --> 02:27.881
and so I just wanted

02:27.881 --> 02:30.283
to get you an oil change
as a peace offering.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.685
(scoffs)
At 3:00 a.m.?

02:31.685 --> 02:32.886
Hope,

02:32.886 --> 02:34.621
you don't have
a driver's license.

02:34.621 --> 02:36.423
You were gonna commit
grand theft auto,

02:36.423 --> 02:37.924
which is a felony.

02:37.924 --> 02:40.694
You're ditching school right
before the midterm exams begin,

02:40.694 --> 02:42.329
and you've made it
very clear to me

02:42.329 --> 02:44.698
that you see me as an authority
figure and nothing more.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.467
So tell me,
why shouldn't I

02:47.467 --> 02:49.202
suspend you this very second?

02:51.371 --> 02:52.606
And what is that?

02:52.606 --> 02:54.608
It's basically
a supernatural compass.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.410
Well, I hope it's pointing you
to your room

02:56.410 --> 02:57.411
'cause that's where
you're going.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.912
I'm going after Landon.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.581
If this thing is glowing, that
means that he's in trouble.

03:04.384 --> 03:08.455
Then we're going,
and I'm driving.

03:09.990 --> 03:13.460
HOPE:
I didn't know it yet,

03:13.460 --> 03:16.196
but Landon was in Kansas
looking for his mom.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.270
He had no idea
what he was walking into.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.705
♪ I don't wanna be talking
on the phone every night... ♪

03:25.705 --> 03:28.442
None of us did.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.676

You must have a serious

03:37.951 --> 03:39.953
You've been here
every day this week.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.922
I just like coffee.

03:43.256 --> 03:45.392
I should get the next one to go.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.560
Hey, I'm not complaining.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.962
Just a little
worried about you.

03:51.832 --> 03:55.769

03:57.037 --> 03:58.538

03:59.840 --> 04:01.508
and I-I don't even
know your name.

04:01.508 --> 04:04.511
Landon.

04:10.016 --> 04:13.320
That's a beautiful one.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.021
Thanks.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.357
I'm, uh...

04:17.357 --> 04:18.792
pretty sure you gave it to me.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.334
("Bee-Sting"
by The Wombats playing)

04:31.404 --> 04:34.808
(singsongy):
Indiana.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.511
Crossroads of America.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.778
What's the capital?

04:38.778 --> 04:40.747
We learned that in, like,
eighth grade.

04:40.747 --> 04:41.948
Oh, good, then you
should know it.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.785
I didn't say I absorbed
the information.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.453
Yeah, well, you're not saying
much of anything.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.821
Look, if you
can't handle

04:47.821 --> 04:49.990
grade school geography...

04:49.990 --> 04:51.892
you're gonna flunk
all your exams.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.928
Are Lizzie and Josie studying?
Maybe you should focus on them.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.364
Yeah, well, they're still
in Europe with Caroline,

04:57.364 --> 04:58.632
thank God.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.700
Religion has no place
in the classroom,

05:00.700 --> 05:01.902
Dr. Saltzman.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.570
The Supreme Court
made sure of that

05:03.570 --> 05:05.105
with its ruling
on Engel v. Vitale.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.040
And Indianapolis
is the capital of Indiana.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.675
I'm getting an "A"
in geography.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.378
Chill.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.682
Take the next left.
He's on the move.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.983
All right.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.686
Indiana is surrounded
by what four states?

05:19.686 --> 05:23.390
I thought we just established
that I am dominating geography.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.524
Fine.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.393
Then let's move on to science.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.964
(dog barking)

05:32.432 --> 05:33.833
Hello.

05:55.121 --> 05:56.756
SEYLAH:
Don't touch that.

06:02.395 --> 06:03.463
Cool.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.703
Um, it's just that I've told you
my whole life story,

06:09.703 --> 06:13.707
but I don't know
anything about you.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.609
And, like,

06:15.609 --> 06:16.910
all this stuff makes
it seem like

06:16.910 --> 06:19.546
you've had a really
interesting life, and...

06:19.546 --> 06:20.947
Is this an actual samurai sword?

06:20.947 --> 06:23.083
Don't touch that, either.
(dog barks)

06:23.083 --> 06:24.651
I'm sorry.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.186
(sighs)

06:26.186 --> 06:28.688
I'm just not used
to having people around.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.690
You don't have to apologize.

06:30.690 --> 06:33.093
This is, this is
weird for me, too.

06:33.093 --> 06:36.463
(chuckles)
Well, in times

06:36.463 --> 06:39.432
of emotional distress, I find
that dessert really helps,

06:39.432 --> 06:40.300
don't you?

06:40.300 --> 06:42.402
Not exactly an expert
on the subject.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.805
Yes, you are.

06:47.207 --> 06:51.845
I'm sorry your life has been
so hard, Landon, I really am.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.480
I was talking about dessert.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.951
And I thought I was putting
a positive spin on all the rest.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.420
I shudder to think that's true.

07:01.988 --> 07:05.158
Um, well, then I'm sorry, too.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.928
I know this is a lot
to put on you,

07:08.928 --> 07:10.664
with me just showing up
like this,

07:10.664 --> 07:12.966
but I'd really like
to know more about...
(dog panting)

07:14.467 --> 07:15.535
Is he okay?

07:15.535 --> 07:18.471
She. Oh...

07:18.471 --> 07:20.240
You didn't feed her
from the table, did you?

07:20.240 --> 07:23.009
Just a little,
but I've-I've never had a dog.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.644
I had no idea
that this would happen.

07:24.644 --> 07:28.748
Relax. She'll be fine.
The drugs will wear off soon.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.751
What drugs?

07:44.497 --> 07:48.535
HOPE: 18 and a half hours is a
long time to spend on the road,

07:48.535 --> 07:51.037
and even longer when
you're being car-schooled.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.506
And that is how osmosis works.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.507
Mm.

07:55.575 --> 07:57.010
Is this the place?

07:57.010 --> 07:59.512
Yup. And not a moment too soon.

07:59.512 --> 08:02.015
Pretty sure you were about
to tell me how babies are made.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.550
Hey, before we go in there,

08:03.550 --> 08:05.585
I just want to make
sure we're clear.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.087
Don't worry, we're crystal.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.988
You're Professor X,
I'm Wolverine.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.191
I was more of a DC kid.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.692
Then you're Batman
and I'm Robin.

08:12.692 --> 08:15.261
Either way,
you call the shots.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.564
So how do you want
to do this, hmm?

08:17.564 --> 08:19.666
Fireball? Wind torrent?

08:19.666 --> 08:20.934
I was thinking we'd knock.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.937
They'll never see that coming.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.977
Seylah, Seylah, please,

08:30.977 --> 08:33.113
I-I-I didn't want
to burden you with this,

08:33.113 --> 08:36.116
but I don't... I don't
do well in captivity.

08:37.851 --> 08:42.255
Seylah, Seylah,
I'm sorry. I-I-I...

08:42.255 --> 08:43.189
Who sent you?

08:43.189 --> 08:47.260
I already told you
my miserable life story.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.195
Nobody gives a crap about me.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.703
Quit playing games.
Who'd you call?

08:56.703 --> 08:58.905
I don't even have a phone.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.641
I never said you did.

09:06.646 --> 09:07.981
You wouldn't believe me.

09:07.981 --> 09:11.251
What I don't believe
is you're my son.

09:11.251 --> 09:15.121
So I suggest you spill your guts
before the iron heats up.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.165
We should come in hot.
There could be a Jabberwocky

09:25.165 --> 09:27.367
on the other side of that door,
for all we know.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.070
Nonsensical poem written by?
Charles Dodgson.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.337
Wrong. Lewis Carroll.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.840
(chuckles) The pen name
of Charles Dodgson.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.909
I'm crushing English, too.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.079
(man screaming)

09:40.079 --> 09:42.048
No, no, no.
Patere.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.389
(gunshots, screaming on TV)
Hi.

09:49.389 --> 09:52.025
Uh, uh, what-what are you
watching?

09:56.796 --> 09:59.933
Oh... (stammers)
I'm so sorry

09:59.933 --> 10:01.668
that we've ruined
your lunch. I...

10:01.668 --> 10:04.637
I-I promise we're gonna
replace your door.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.940
That's some compass.
We're in the wrong place.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.679
(chuckles)

10:15.782 --> 10:17.617
Someone knew we were coming.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.958
(steam hissing)

10:24.958 --> 10:26.326
Why so quiet?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.761
You wouldn't shut up
when we were having lunch.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.129
I thought you believed me.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.031
Now I'm not giving you anything.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.373
(steam hissing)

10:41.908 --> 10:45.011
Everyone talks...

10:45.011 --> 10:46.913
eventually.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.749
Please don't do this.

10:49.749 --> 10:52.385
I swear to you I am
telling you the truth.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.853
I am your son.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.088
Stop saying that,

10:55.088 --> 10:57.123
or I'll burn
your lips shut.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.460
The Salvatore School.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.161
That's who I called.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.397
That boarding school
I was telling you about?

11:04.397 --> 11:08.134
It's a school for vampires and
witches and werewolves and...

11:08.134 --> 11:10.003
Because they're real.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.006
And so are dragons and gargoyles
and freaking talking trees

11:13.006 --> 11:14.707
and I don't know what else!

11:19.345 --> 11:21.314
You got to be kidding me.
You believe that

11:21.314 --> 11:23.182
but not that I'm your son?

11:28.955 --> 11:30.690
(whispering):
They're here.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.760
They must have followed you.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.994
(dog barking)

11:34.994 --> 11:36.763
(stammers)

11:36.763 --> 11:40.033
Wait. You got...
You have to cut me loose.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.302
(dog continues barking)

11:42.302 --> 11:43.970
HOPE:
Spoiler alert.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.172
Our story's about to take
one hell of a turn.

11:46.172 --> 11:48.141
(dog yelps, barking stops)

11:48.141 --> 11:49.943
A monstrous turn.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.278
Seylah, is that you?

11:52.278 --> 11:54.214
(bones creaking,
heaving breathing)

12:02.055 --> 12:04.123
Holy smokes.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.261
We can talk about this.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.706
(bones creaking)

12:21.941 --> 12:23.509
If you have a mouth.

12:23.509 --> 12:26.312
(muffled roar)

12:38.458 --> 12:42.228
HOPE: I used Landon's bracelet
to do a locator spell,

12:42.228 --> 12:45.498
but all it located was
more trouble.

12:57.910 --> 12:58.978
Can I help you?

12:58.978 --> 13:01.014
Yeah, I hope so. Uh...

13:01.014 --> 13:02.181
(device whirring)

13:02.181 --> 13:03.583
Say, what's going on here?

13:03.583 --> 13:07.420
Gas leak. Don't worry, though,
we have it under control.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.223
You wouldn't happen to know
who lives here, would you?

13:10.223 --> 13:11.557
We tried knocking,
but no one's home.

13:11.557 --> 13:14.160
Um, we're looking for...
The highway.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.597
See, we're lost, and we...
well, we saw you guys,

13:17.597 --> 13:19.265
and we thought we'd
ask for directions.

13:21.167 --> 13:24.604
Yeah, at the end of the road,
you make a right. Can't miss it.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.172
Cool. Thanks.

13:26.172 --> 13:29.509
All right, let's go, Jessica.

13:37.216 --> 13:39.419
"Jessica"? Really?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.254
I've been part of
enough cover-ups

13:41.254 --> 13:43.156
to smell one a mile away.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.924
Do you think they're
after Landon?

13:44.924 --> 13:46.526
Well, all I know
is they wouldn't have

13:46.526 --> 13:48.494
asked about him
if they had him, so...

13:48.494 --> 13:51.197
we gotta find him
before they do.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.934
HOPE: It seemed like the whole
world was chasing Landon,

13:54.934 --> 13:57.170
but only one person
was actually with him.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.871
If you won't tell
me who they are,

13:58.871 --> 14:01.074
will you at least tell me
why they are following you?

14:01.074 --> 14:04.277
(sighs) They weren't,
until you showed up.

14:04.277 --> 14:08.281
So, maybe they're
following you.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.283
I'm not stupid.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.351
I would have noticed
if I was being followed.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.460
Close your eyes.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.428
How many windows
are in this room?

14:22.428 --> 14:24.530
What? We just got here.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.966
The parking lot,
how many cars?

14:26.966 --> 14:28.234
I don't know, like ten?

14:28.234 --> 14:31.437
The man who gave us the keys,
was he right- or left-handed?

14:31.437 --> 14:33.072
Nobody notices
stuff like that.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.374
Three, seven, ambidextrous.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.354
Tell me more about you.
Why?

14:48.354 --> 14:50.156
Because you care
or because you want intel?

14:50.156 --> 14:51.390
Does it matter?

14:51.390 --> 14:53.526
Either way,
I genuinely want to know.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.627
Too bad.

14:54.627 --> 14:58.297
I've already told you
my entire tragic life story.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.267
Do you have a girlfriend?

15:06.405 --> 15:09.408
Her name is Hope.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.043
And she'd probably kill us both

15:11.043 --> 15:13.412
if she heard you
calling her my girlfriend.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.415
I doubt that very much.
Right.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.151
Ninja.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.719
Hope and I are...

15:19.719 --> 15:21.187
complicated.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.421
I-I hurt her once,

15:22.421 --> 15:24.157
and I don't think she's ever

15:24.157 --> 15:25.725
going to forgive me for it.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.193
What'd you do?

15:27.193 --> 15:28.594
I lied to her.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.331
And other stuff.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.100
Deep down, I think it's
the lying part

15:34.100 --> 15:35.334
she'll never understand.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.570
She sounds tough.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.071
Look who's talking.

15:39.071 --> 15:39.939
(chuckles)

15:39.939 --> 15:42.508
You two would probably
hate each other.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.710
I guess it's true, then.

15:44.710 --> 15:48.080
Boys like girls who remind them
of their mothers.

15:54.554 --> 15:59.358
You're stubborn...
and surrounded by danger.

16:01.727 --> 16:05.097
You're my son, all right.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.004
(doorknob rattles)

16:24.584 --> 16:27.553
Uh, I'm looking for
Landon Kirby.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.623
And who the hell are you?

16:30.623 --> 16:31.691
Uh...

16:33.259 --> 16:34.660
People who care about him.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.963
So tell me where he is
before I blow your head off.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.068
You must be Hope.

16:48.808 --> 16:52.144
SEYLAH: So you're the headmaster
of a private school

16:52.144 --> 16:53.479
for supernaturals.

16:53.479 --> 16:54.714
And you're the
teacher's pet?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.749
Actually, she's kind of
a pain in my ass.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.418
A little judgy
for an absentee mother.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.020
You were wrong.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.556
I like her.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.324
Well, now you
know about us.

17:05.324 --> 17:08.327
All we know about you is that
you gave birth to Landon,

17:08.327 --> 17:11.163
he says a monster attacked you,
and now there's some sort of

17:11.163 --> 17:13.332
fake gas company
coming after you two.

17:13.332 --> 17:18.437
So, I think it's time you
start filling in some blanks.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.250
When I finished my service
in the army,

17:31.250 --> 17:34.086
I was recruited by
an intelligence organization.

17:34.086 --> 17:36.656
The States sounded like
a better life.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.158
I didn't know what
I was signing up for,

17:39.158 --> 17:41.694
but soon I learned
that things like you

17:41.694 --> 17:44.463
exist in this world.

17:44.463 --> 17:47.199
My job was very much like yours.

17:47.199 --> 17:50.569
To keep the supernatural world
a secret.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.306
Whenever a monster
went bump in the night

17:53.306 --> 17:55.474
and risked
exposing the truth,

17:55.474 --> 17:59.412
I tracked it down and brought it
back to headquarters.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.247
We're not monsters.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.516
You are to me.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.319
This headquarters, where is it?

18:06.319 --> 18:08.487
Sorry.

18:08.487 --> 18:09.822
You just seem
morally inclined enough

18:09.822 --> 18:11.524
to do something stupid,
and there's

18:11.524 --> 18:13.526
too much blood on my hands
as it is.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.294
A few years in,

18:15.294 --> 18:17.096
I saw something I shouldn't.

18:18.764 --> 18:22.601
I became the hunted
instead of the hunter.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.139
What exactly
did you see?

18:27.139 --> 18:29.709
I wanted to know what was
happening to the monsters.

18:32.878 --> 18:36.716
Because even though
I spent all that time

18:36.716 --> 18:39.151
studying their every move,

18:39.151 --> 18:42.321
I couldn't
remember them at all.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.158
So I started taking notes.

18:46.158 --> 18:49.795
I realized my memory
was being erased.

18:49.795 --> 18:53.299
The question was: How?

18:53.299 --> 18:54.600
Malivore.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.569
How do you know about Malivore?

18:56.569 --> 18:59.472
Landon took a knife
that belonged to

18:59.472 --> 19:00.873
our school's collection.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.808
Now monsters
that shouldn't exist

19:02.808 --> 19:05.444
have been coming after it
ever since.

19:05.444 --> 19:06.946
LANDON:
He means I stole it.

19:06.946 --> 19:11.484
And then I, like, um,
woke it up or something.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.718
What's Malivore?

19:12.718 --> 19:15.221
It's a hell dimension

19:15.221 --> 19:17.423
that consumes creatures
and wipes their existence

19:17.423 --> 19:18.691
from the collective conscience.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.659
Sound about right?

19:20.659 --> 19:22.261
More or less.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.195
Awesome.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.964
The last monster that
came for the knife

19:24.964 --> 19:27.566
was a Necromancer
who screwed us over

19:27.566 --> 19:29.402
and returned it
back to Malivore.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.736
Long story.

19:30.736 --> 19:33.205
But he said that the knife
is one of three keys

19:33.205 --> 19:34.740
that kept Malivore contained,

19:34.740 --> 19:37.877
so why are monsters
still coming for you?

19:37.877 --> 19:39.945
I have no idea.
Didn't really get a chance to

19:39.945 --> 19:41.714
ask the last one.
He just tried to eat me.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.816
As you can see,
it's been a rough semester.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.318
It will only get worse

19:46.318 --> 19:47.887
if you don't go home

19:47.887 --> 19:49.889
and forget you heard the name.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.926
Just like we forget anyone
who's ever been there.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.462
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You-you have to tell us more.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.530
I mean...

19:57.530 --> 19:59.365
I don't know who your father is.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.001
My job was stressful,

20:02.001 --> 20:05.604
so I had flings
to blow off steam.

20:05.604 --> 20:06.772
Got pregnant,

20:06.772 --> 20:08.641
and just like your
not-girlfriend said,

20:08.641 --> 20:10.743
I'm not equipped to be a mother.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.280
Sorry.

20:14.280 --> 20:17.783
I thought I was giving you
a better life.

20:18.784 --> 20:21.387
(door opens, shuts)

20:22.755 --> 20:25.791
HOPE: You want to know
the worst part?

20:25.791 --> 20:28.294
That wasn't the worst part.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.764
(Alaric sighs)

20:35.000 --> 20:37.736
Oh, believe me, I would,
but I'm...

20:37.736 --> 20:40.039
trying to cut back.
(chuckles)

20:40.039 --> 20:42.975
Look, I get how hard this is,

20:42.975 --> 20:45.711
but we need some answers.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.880
You already know
everything I know.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.883
I think we both know
that's a lie.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.818
Just like you lied to Landon
about not knowing

20:52.818 --> 20:54.353
who his father is.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.622
What makes you think
I was lying?

20:56.622 --> 20:59.959
Bad liars look away
when they lie to their kids.

20:59.959 --> 21:03.229
Good liars look 'em
straight in the eye.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.899
We have something
in common, then.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.068
You have children?

21:09.068 --> 21:10.803
Two girls.

21:10.803 --> 21:14.306
So take my hard-earned advice.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.476
Tell Landon the truth.

21:19.311 --> 21:22.448
How about I tell you instead?

21:24.583 --> 21:26.986
Just to see if you believe me.

21:28.654 --> 21:29.789
(sniffles)

21:29.789 --> 21:32.424
Because I'm still not sure

21:32.424 --> 21:35.861
that I believe what I'm about
to say, and I lived it.

21:40.332 --> 21:41.867
The organization
I used to work for

21:41.867 --> 21:45.004
guards the portal to Malivore.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.006
When I realized I was
having memory lapses,

21:47.006 --> 21:49.642
I started writing
everything down.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.477
Drawing maps.

21:51.477 --> 21:56.415
I wrote about the creatures I
captured and where I took them.

21:56.415 --> 21:59.585
Each entry ended there.

21:59.585 --> 22:00.886
So where'd you take them?

22:00.886 --> 22:03.789
(laughs softly)

22:03.789 --> 22:05.925
Nah, that's not important.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.827
Eh, that seems
super important to me.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.528
Well, then I'm not
gonna tell you.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.432
For your own good, believe me.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.601
One day, I snuck
in by myself.

22:15.601 --> 22:19.605
And what I found was a...

22:19.605 --> 22:21.807
a black pit,

22:21.807 --> 22:23.542
locked away.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.444
Is that supposed
to be a metaphor?

22:25.444 --> 22:26.545
Oh, no.

22:26.545 --> 22:29.682
It's an actual pit,
filled with...

22:29.682 --> 22:32.885
tar, uh, or something.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.954
A literal pit of doom.

22:34.954 --> 22:39.858
The story has it that if, uh,
Malivore consumes you,

22:39.858 --> 22:43.629
you experience endless darkness.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.631
Yeah.

22:45.631 --> 22:47.700
It's not just a story, though.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.068
And I should know.

22:50.669 --> 22:53.339
I've been there.

23:00.779 --> 23:03.415
HOPE: Landon,
I'm really sorry.

23:03.415 --> 23:05.718
Don't be.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.686
(sighs)

23:07.686 --> 23:09.088
It'll be okay.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.124
You can't trust her.
I don't.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.994
But she's my mother, Hope.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.596
All I've ever wanted
is a family.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.131
A home.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.966
So I'm not gonna give up on her

23:20.966 --> 23:22.901
just 'cause she's
a little screwed up.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.705
That would be
pretty hypocritical.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.641
You're not that screwed up.

23:33.679 --> 23:37.016
I hate that you always see me
when I'm weak.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.018
(whispering):
You're not weak.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.654
You're a survivor.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.022
Landon, that
makes you one of

23:43.022 --> 23:44.857
the strongest people
that I know.

23:44.857 --> 23:48.894
I'm starting to think
I'm a bit of a danger magnet.

23:48.894 --> 23:51.730
I'm starting
to think you're right.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.532
(laughs softly)

23:53.532 --> 23:57.836
I didn't... I didn't mean to

"Dear Hope..."

24:40.279 --> 24:43.682
"The state of Alabama
has, like,

24:43.682 --> 24:45.217
"a million Waffle Houses,

24:45.217 --> 24:49.021
and I cannot stop thinking about
what it felt like to kiss you."

24:50.089 --> 24:53.092
♪ How can I resist ♪

24:53.092 --> 24:57.162
♪ When it feels like this? ♪

24:57.162 --> 24:58.630
When my former employers

24:58.630 --> 25:00.699
discovered that I was trying
to remember

25:00.699 --> 25:04.002
the things they made me forget,
they tossed me into the pit.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.105
So how are we having
this conversation?

25:06.105 --> 25:07.706
I don't know.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.309
I don't even know
how long I was in Malivore,

25:10.309 --> 25:13.145
only that I felt
the things you described,

25:13.145 --> 25:17.649
the isolation, the loneliness.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.019
And then, one day,
I found myself back here.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.988
I woke up
in the middle of nowhere,

25:22.988 --> 25:26.825
covered in mud,
absolutely no idea

25:26.825 --> 25:28.794
how I got there.

25:28.794 --> 25:32.131
Turns out two years had gone by,

25:32.131 --> 25:34.633
but there was a bright side.

25:34.633 --> 25:37.970
No one I worked for
remembered me.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.938
So you were free.

25:39.938 --> 25:42.941
I wouldn't go that far,

25:42.941 --> 25:45.744
because there was also a catch.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.515
I was pregnant.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.892
Thank you,

25:59.892 --> 26:01.093
f-for coming for me.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.661
I needed help, and you came.

26:02.661 --> 26:04.797
That's never really
happened to me before.

26:04.797 --> 26:07.266
Sounds like you've had
crappy girls in your life.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.134
Oh, I've had zero girls
in my life.

26:09.134 --> 26:11.036
(chuckles)
Unless you count

26:11.036 --> 26:12.638
Lisa Marie Albertson,

26:12.638 --> 26:14.840
who asked me
to take her to the prom,

26:14.840 --> 26:16.809
and then,
when I said no,

26:16.809 --> 26:19.244
told the entire school that
it was because I couldn't afford

26:19.244 --> 26:20.846
to pay for it.
Well,

26:20.846 --> 26:24.349
my first kiss was
with a 90-year-old vampire

26:24.349 --> 26:26.785
who helped murder my mother.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.755
(whispers):
That's terrible.
Yeah.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.825
And prom
is super expensive, so...

26:32.825 --> 26:34.760
People suck.
People suck.

26:40.632 --> 26:41.700
Hope.

26:41.700 --> 26:42.901
Yeah?

26:42.901 --> 26:44.903
I will never hurt you again.

26:44.903 --> 26:46.605
Ever.

26:47.806 --> 26:50.709
ALARIC:
So Landon is basically a, uh,

26:50.709 --> 26:53.178
supernatural
immaculate conception?

26:53.178 --> 26:55.180
I'll be damned.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.915
You believe me.

26:56.915 --> 26:59.384
My twins were
magically transplanted

26:59.384 --> 27:02.054
into their mother's womb
by a coven of witches,

27:02.054 --> 27:03.956
so my belief tolerance

27:03.956 --> 27:06.792
is pretty high.
(chuckles)

27:06.792 --> 27:10.095
I can't imagine how you
explained that to your kids.

27:10.095 --> 27:11.396
Yeah.

27:11.396 --> 27:13.866
It was easier for me
to leave Landon

27:13.866 --> 27:17.035
in a small basket on the steps
of a local church.

27:17.035 --> 27:20.172
Oh, you were young, scared.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.007
I was selfish.

27:22.007 --> 27:23.876
And now I'm tired.

27:23.876 --> 27:26.778
I've spent 18 years
trying to stay off the grid.

27:26.778 --> 27:28.747
To remain erased.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.752
I can't be his mother.

27:33.752 --> 27:36.088
Not in the way
he needs me to be.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.390
Sorry.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.392
You can't just
leave him, Seylah.

27:40.392 --> 27:43.862
He'll be better off.
You all will.

27:43.862 --> 27:50.168
HOPE: As if that wasn't
weird enough,

27:50.168 --> 27:54.740
I should warn you, our story's
about to get even fishier.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.355
Oh! Hey, uh...

28:10.355 --> 28:13.825
Hope, uh, get-get
another room. Now.

28:13.825 --> 28:15.460
You're the one
that's always saying

28:15.460 --> 28:17.162
I need to connect more
with people.

28:17.162 --> 28:18.363
Yeah, not literally. Get out.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.232
(quietly):
Get out.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.168
(door closes)

28:23.168 --> 28:26.505
Uh, Dr. Saltzman. Uh, I'm, uh...

28:26.505 --> 28:27.973
A sexed-up teenager.

28:27.973 --> 28:29.841
It's perfectly normal.

28:29.841 --> 28:32.344
Don't let anyone else
tell you otherwise.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.179
(exhales)

28:34.179 --> 28:37.015
So you're not mad?

28:38.150 --> 28:40.018
We got bigger fish to fry.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.991
We need to talk
about your mother.

29:00.005 --> 29:01.940
Let me guess. Pizza run?

29:01.940 --> 29:04.076
Alaric was right.
You are a pain.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.445
I'm not the one stealing a car
at the moment.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.281
It's my car,
so it's not stealing.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.950
Oh, then you're just afraid
to go upstairs and get your keys

29:11.950 --> 29:13.452
because then you'd
have to tell Landon

29:13.452 --> 29:15.020
that you're
abandoning him again.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.389
Even worse.

29:17.389 --> 29:18.890
He likes you, Hope.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.059
Be good to him.

29:21.059 --> 29:22.160
You first.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.395
Now, are you coming with,

29:23.395 --> 29:25.030
or do I need
to drag your ass upstairs?

29:27.299 --> 29:29.001
I never thought
I'd see him again.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.404
And I was okay with that.

29:33.538 --> 29:35.440
Being a mother was never
on my list

29:35.440 --> 29:37.509
of things to do before I died.

29:37.509 --> 29:40.045
Every now and then,
over the years, I...

29:40.045 --> 29:41.613
I wondered how he was.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.950
What kind of person
he turned out to be.

29:46.385 --> 29:50.155
If he had a nice life.

29:50.155 --> 29:52.090
(exhales)

29:55.193 --> 29:58.263
Turns out he's a good person
with a crappy life.

29:58.263 --> 29:59.531
He deserves better.

29:59.531 --> 30:01.233
Then help make it better.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.068
That's exactly what I'm doing.

30:03.068 --> 30:06.271
(engine starts)

30:06.271 --> 30:09.408
What you think you're doing
for him doesn't matter.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.076
All that he's gonna
remember of you

30:11.076 --> 30:14.079
is that you abandoned him
when he needed you the most.

30:14.079 --> 30:15.514
No.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.449
He won't remember me, period.

30:17.449 --> 30:20.385
And neither will you.

30:38.003 --> 30:41.206
Wait, wait, she got pregnant
in Satan's mud bath?

30:41.206 --> 30:43.442
Yeah, that's-that's
a lot to take in.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.910
And now she's gone?

30:44.910 --> 30:48.213
Look, being a-a parent
i-is complicated.

30:49.414 --> 30:51.016
Sometimes we convince ourselves

30:51.016 --> 30:54.252
that we're doing the
right thing, when in reality,

30:54.252 --> 30:57.456
we're just being really dumb.

31:00.092 --> 31:04.029
Look, I-I've got to check in
on Hope, okay?

31:10.435 --> 31:12.304
Bigger fish. Huge fish.

31:12.304 --> 31:13.438
(snarls)

31:14.306 --> 31:15.707
Ictus.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.143
(creature screeches)

31:18.143 --> 31:19.644
Also: ick!

31:19.644 --> 31:22.013
See? Danger magnet.

31:22.013 --> 31:24.116
What the hell was that?
Uh, I'm guessing a Mer-Man.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.985
A very pissed Mer-Man.
Why are the monsters
still coming for them?

31:26.985 --> 31:28.320
We don't even have
what they want.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.188
I don't know, but we got
to get Landon out of here.

31:30.188 --> 31:32.057
Oh, no.
What?

31:32.057 --> 31:33.458
You said a necromancer
told you the knife

31:33.458 --> 31:34.593
was one of three keys, right?

31:34.593 --> 31:36.061
The Necromancer. Like I said,

31:36.061 --> 31:37.963
it's a long story,
But why does it matter?

31:40.599 --> 31:42.501
Son of a bitch.

31:42.501 --> 31:46.071
This is Seylah's. I picked
it up, but I didn't steal it.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.606
I-I...
Not on purpose, anyway.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.074
I don't know how it got
in there, just like

31:49.074 --> 31:50.475
how I don't know
what happened with the knife.

31:50.475 --> 31:52.611
I swear, I wouldn't
do that again.
Landon, Landon.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.079
It's okay.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.247
I believe you.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.715
(Mer-Man growls, water splashes)

31:56.715 --> 31:58.617
Oh, we got to move.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.018
No, no, no, wait.
Leave it, leave it.

32:00.018 --> 32:01.486
What? Are you out of your mind?
No.

32:01.486 --> 32:02.687
I'm just sick of playing
the same game.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.055
So let the monster have it.

32:04.055 --> 32:05.223
He'll take it to Malivore.

32:05.223 --> 32:06.525
We follow him,
we know where it is.

32:06.525 --> 32:07.692
ALARIC: I am not
taking two teenagers

32:07.692 --> 32:09.694
to a covert military
hiding place

32:09.694 --> 32:11.062
for a demon portal.

32:11.062 --> 32:12.597
You kind of have to.
Why?

32:12.597 --> 32:13.999
Because Seylah's going there.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.133
What? Did she tell you that?

32:15.133 --> 32:16.668
In her own way.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.971
Hold that.

32:21.540 --> 32:24.309
I'll explain in the car.
Let's go.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.945
H-He's a fish man on land.
How fast can he be, right?

32:28.380 --> 32:30.282
Oh, my God!

32:42.994 --> 32:44.863
Turns out
he's pretty fast.

32:44.863 --> 32:47.032
Listen, this was your idea.
So is it within my bounds

32:47.032 --> 32:48.633
as the headmaster to
tell you to shut it?

32:48.633 --> 32:50.135
What if we don't
get there in time?

32:50.135 --> 32:52.070
Seylah doesn't have that much
of a lead on us.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.572
I can't believe she wants
to erase herself

32:53.572 --> 32:55.373
just to get out
of being a parent.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.442
What the hell is that?

33:09.721 --> 33:10.755
Triad.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.057
LANDON: Explosives?

33:12.057 --> 33:13.992
On the bright side,
maybe this fence stopped

33:13.992 --> 33:15.560
our fishy friend.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.633
I don't think so.

33:27.639 --> 33:28.707
There.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.949
Hey, stay back.
He's dangerous.

33:37.949 --> 33:39.084
I have to get in there.

33:39.084 --> 33:41.119
Landon!
Wait, guys, be careful!

33:44.923 --> 33:47.025
(beeping)

33:59.738 --> 34:02.841
HOPE: I can only speculate
about what happened after that,

34:02.841 --> 34:05.577
but in hindsight,
I think it's pretty obvious.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.646
We got a break-in.
I'm on it.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.848
HOPE:
Seylah went to Triad.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.449
(gunshot)

34:17.055 --> 34:18.523
(alarm sounding)

34:18.523 --> 34:21.126
And then she went to Malivore.

34:32.537 --> 34:35.540
I'm sure Triad
tried to stop her.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.778
But she had a reason to fight.

34:39.778 --> 34:41.980
And in the end,
I'm guessing she won.

34:41.980 --> 34:44.616
(gunshot)

34:47.752 --> 34:51.489
(grunting and groaning)

35:05.136 --> 35:08.173
(tar bubbling)

35:18.950 --> 35:23.054
She sacrificed herself...
for Landon.

35:27.892 --> 35:30.528
And then she was erased.

35:32.197 --> 35:34.632
(birds chirping)

35:37.702 --> 35:39.671
(grunts)

35:41.740 --> 35:43.708
(groans)

35:47.112 --> 35:49.114
Where the hell are we?

35:49.114 --> 35:51.683
What happened?

35:51.683 --> 35:52.917
I don't know.

35:52.917 --> 35:56.788
But I don't think
we're in Kansas anymore.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.569
LANDON:
Thank you again

36:11.569 --> 36:13.071

working out with the werewolves.

I was just sitting here,

37:29.447 --> 37:32.317
looking at the fancy new clothes
the school gave me,

37:32.317 --> 37:34.319
trying to make peace
with the fact

37:34.319 --> 37:36.821
that I may never meet
the woman in that picture.

37:36.821 --> 37:38.823
Which I seem to have lost
somehow.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.862
What do you think she's like?

37:46.865 --> 37:50.401
I think that she's
an international assassin

37:50.401 --> 37:53.238
that specializes in
killing monsters.

37:53.238 --> 37:56.541
And that she loves
you very much,

37:56.541 --> 37:59.444
in her own way.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.678
(laughs)

38:00.678 --> 38:02.413
Oh, let's be honest.

38:02.413 --> 38:04.349
Nobody that cool
gave birth to me.

38:05.717 --> 38:09.754
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

38:11.890 --> 38:14.826
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

38:16.394 --> 38:18.363
Are you serious?

38:18.363 --> 38:19.697
Deadly.

38:19.697 --> 38:22.367
Well, what brought this on?

38:22.367 --> 38:24.502
I don't know, I...
(chuckles)

38:24.502 --> 38:26.504
I guess I'm-I'm just...

38:26.504 --> 38:29.841
I'm really happy
that you're back.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.910
Well, it's a big decision.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.846
I know.
We should probably sleep on it.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.814
No. Absolutely not.

38:36.814 --> 38:40.251
Well, in that case, yeah.
I'd really like that.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.288
HOPE:
And that's it.

38:43.288 --> 38:46.624
Which brings me to my question.

38:46.624 --> 38:48.760
What do we do next?

38:48.760 --> 38:51.563
ALARIC: How am I
supposed to know?

38:51.563 --> 38:53.798
I don't remember doing
anything you just said.

38:53.798 --> 38:55.733
You'll know
because you always know.

38:55.733 --> 38:57.001
Because you're a good headmaster

38:57.001 --> 38:58.970
in spite of all the things
that I say.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.672
(laughs softly)
Well, in that case,

39:00.672 --> 39:03.775
I think the only question we
should be asking ourselves is:

39:03.775 --> 39:05.443
Why do you remember?

39:05.443 --> 39:07.312
I don't know.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.647
But I can't imagine
that it's good.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.718
(sighs) And I can lie to Landon
about all of this,

39:13.718 --> 39:17.622
but I'm sorry, Dr. Saltzman,
I just can't lie to you.

39:18.823 --> 39:21.192
'Cause I really need your help.

39:22.493 --> 39:26.631
Speaking of,
there's one more thing.

39:38.643 --> 39:40.278
I take it that's the urn

39:40.278 --> 39:41.613
I don't remember.

39:41.613 --> 39:44.449
Yeah. I figured it was better
to have it here

39:44.449 --> 39:46.651
than to leave it laying around.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.221
So what happens now?

39:58.930 --> 40:00.965
I think we're about to find out.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.304
(device beeping)

40:11.809 --> 40:14.078
What happened here?

40:14.078 --> 40:15.980
Unscheduled absorption.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.448
What, another rat?

40:17.448 --> 40:19.751
No, readings are
too big for that.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.486
Like, human big.

40:21.486 --> 40:22.820
Well, any idea who it was?

40:22.820 --> 40:24.656
Of course not.

40:24.656 --> 40:25.690
I wouldn't remember

40:25.690 --> 40:26.924
if it was my best friend.

40:26.924 --> 40:28.926
But I did find this...

40:30.762 --> 40:32.297
...floating on the surface.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.471
What... No, no!

40:40.471 --> 40:41.539
(gurgling)
