<i>If you love stories</i>
<i>about families that stick together</i>

00:14.208 --> 00:18.833
<i>and love each other through thick and thin</i>
<i>and it all ends happily ever after...</i>

00:20.333 --> 00:22.708
<i>this isn't the film for you, okay? </i>

00:26.083 --> 00:29.250
<i>This is my city. I've seen it all.</i>

00:29.333 --> 00:32.666
<i>Look at 'em.</i>
<i>Boring people living boring lives.</i>

00:32.750 --> 00:34.291
<i>I'm not judging.</i>

00:34.375 --> 00:35.625
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

00:35.708 --> 00:38.416
<i>I've stared into a lot of windows, okay?</i>

00:38.500 --> 00:43.291
<i>I've seen happy families, supportive</i>
<i>families, functional families. Ugh.</i>

00:43.916 --> 00:48.083
<i>But the best stories are always</i>
<i>in the windows where nobody looks.</i>

00:48.958 --> 00:50.125
<i>No, look down.</i>

00:51.166 --> 00:52.916
There they are. Hidden.

00:53.791 --> 00:56.125
I'm the narrator, by the way.

00:56.750 --> 00:59.458
And a cat. Get over it, yeah?

00:59.541 --> 01:02.333
This family's story is weird, you know,

01:02.416 --> 01:05.833
hidden away from the modern world
in their old-fashioned home.

01:05.916 --> 01:08.833
I'll show you around.
Fantastic mouse hunting here.

01:08.916 --> 01:12.958
When I say "old-fashioned,"
I mean they go back a long way.

01:14.291 --> 01:20.416
A family legacy of tradition, invention,
creativity and courage.

01:21.625 --> 01:25.458
Their greatness passed down
like their magnificent facial hair

01:25.541 --> 01:28.750
from generation to generation
to generation.

01:29.375 --> 01:30.666
Until this one.

01:34.500 --> 01:40.708
-I so love being a Willoughby with you.
-Oh, smoopsy buns. I'm so happy!

01:42.958 --> 01:44.666
Let's jump ahead a few months,

01:44.750 --> 01:47.166
when this loving
and perfect marriage produced...

01:49.916 --> 01:51.208
Well, you know.

01:51.291 --> 01:53.375
- What is that?
- Oh, dear.

01:56.875 --> 01:58.416
I'm your father,

01:58.500 --> 02:02.875
and that sweet woman that you insulted
with your rude birth is Mother.

02:07.208 --> 02:12.291
If you need love, I beg of you,
find it elsewhere. Thank you.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.166
Oh, you are Tim,

02:15.791 --> 02:18.541
-and you are a Willoughby.

02:19.125 --> 02:19.958
Good day, sir.

02:20.041 --> 02:22.958
<i>His loving parents</i>
<i>had no love left over for Tim.</i>

02:23.833 --> 02:25.750
<i>All they gave him was his name.</i>

02:27.125 --> 02:28.125
Ooh!

02:28.208 --> 02:32.833
<i>Willoughby.</i>

02:32.916 --> 02:35.791
Oh. Willough...

02:35.875 --> 02:38.833
...by.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.083
<i>Oh, and siblings.</i>

02:41.166 --> 02:42.958
<i>-A sister named Jane...</i>

02:43.041 --> 02:45.625
- Our parents will hear you!

02:45.708 --> 02:49.375
<i>...and twin brothers,</i>
<i>both named Barnaby. They're creepy.</i>

02:49.458 --> 02:51.083
-Thanks, Barnaby.
-You're welcome, Barnaby.

02:52.541 --> 02:54.208
Why are we staring at this wall?

02:54.291 --> 02:57.583
Because, Jane, we are Willoughbys.

03:04.833 --> 03:07.916
<i>Okay, this Willoughby story</i>
<i>is odd, all right?</i>

03:08.000 --> 03:12.166
<i>But it's not all bad. At least</i>
<i>they ate every family meal together.</i>

03:13.166 --> 03:15.041
<i>And by "they," I mean these two.</i>

03:15.125 --> 03:18.333
-You like it spicy, don't you?
-Oh, I don't just like it...

03:18.416 --> 03:20.166
I loaf it.

03:20.250 --> 03:23.125
<i>They just forgot to share</i>
<i>with their kids.</i>

03:23.208 --> 03:25.333
I do not predict leftovers.

03:25.416 --> 03:28.583
But I'm so hungry
I just want to eat my own tongue.

03:28.666 --> 03:29.750
-Me, too.
-Me, too.

03:29.833 --> 03:30.666
Us, too.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.333
What if we dress a Barnaby up like food--

03:33.416 --> 03:34.500
-Bad idea.
-Terrible idea.

03:34.583 --> 03:35.541
No, Jane.

03:35.625 --> 03:36.916
Okay, then, what if I go?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.125
-Stop what if-ing!
- Yeah.

03:38.208 --> 03:39.041
No what-ifs.

03:39.125 --> 03:43.000
I know you're hungry,
but Willoughbys do not beg for food.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.833
-We wait.

03:44.916 --> 03:47.208
- Oh.

03:54.458 --> 03:55.666
May we have food?

03:56.916 --> 03:59.083
-Food?
-We eat today's food.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.375
You eat yesterday's food.

04:01.458 --> 04:04.416
But you ate all
of yesterday's food yesterday.

04:05.333 --> 04:08.791
So there is no food left over for... Jane!

04:08.875 --> 04:11.791
Huh? My name is Mother. Who is this Jane?

04:11.875 --> 04:15.541
You call your mother names,
and you expect us to feed you?

04:15.625 --> 04:16.875
-No, no, no.
- No?

04:16.958 --> 04:19.625
I mean...
Yes, Mother. Don't!

04:19.708 --> 04:20.583
Don't?

04:20.666 --> 04:23.458
You do not tell your mother
what to do not do!

04:25.041 --> 04:28.458
-You selfish boy. You ate it all.
-No, I didn't!

04:28.541 --> 04:32.458
Oh, Father,
I'm going to starve.

04:33.041 --> 04:35.208
-It's that girl!

04:35.291 --> 04:37.791
-She brought the small one.
-They are creepy.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.083
Hi, Mommy.

04:39.166 --> 04:40.250
What are they doing here?

04:40.333 --> 04:41.333
-Nothing.
- Bye, Mommy!

04:41.416 --> 04:43.041
-They're, uh, going...
-Hungry.

04:43.125 --> 04:46.666
These children, always wanting.

04:46.750 --> 04:49.041
-We're fine. Jane!
-The Barnabys could use another sweater.

04:49.125 --> 04:50.416
-One's good.
-We like one.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.916
- Barnabys!
-You want two.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Stop talking.

04:53.083 --> 04:54.708
-Look at me, I'm fretting.
-Dreadful.

04:54.791 --> 04:56.000
-I'm all a-fret.
-Appalling.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.000
-I can't knit!
-This is all your fault!

04:58.083 --> 04:59.875
My fault? Wha--

05:03.458 --> 05:08.791
Son, you insist on bothering us
with your childish needs.

05:09.416 --> 05:11.125
Go to the coal bin!

05:11.791 --> 05:12.916
Good day, sir.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.166
<i> Poor Timothy.</i>

05:20.250 --> 05:23.583
<i>That's a rotten place for a hairless kid</i>
<i>in short trousers, innit?</i>

05:25.666 --> 05:29.333
Sometimes,
I wish I wasn't a Willoughby.

05:36.791 --> 05:38.541
We used to be great.

05:44.125 --> 05:49.333
We were soldiers and scientists,
kings and philosophers,

05:49.416 --> 05:52.708
explorers and aviators, artists and poets!

05:52.791 --> 05:54.750
We climbed the unclimbable,

05:54.833 --> 05:59.541
and we always ate together...
at tables, like a family,

06:00.458 --> 06:04.958
where every Willoughby had a mustache,
even the women.

06:06.708 --> 06:08.541
We could be great again.

06:09.666 --> 06:10.500
No...

06:12.125 --> 06:13.750
We will be.

06:14.333 --> 06:19.541
Against all odds, the Willoughby children
still had determination...

06:20.041 --> 06:22.291
-Nice job, Barnaby.
-You, too, Barnaby.

06:22.375 --> 06:23.750
Bye-bye, dirigible!

06:23.833 --> 06:25.416
...imagination...

06:28.291 --> 06:29.541
and hope.

06:47.750 --> 06:49.916

06:50.958 --> 06:53.166
- If she misses a stitch...

06:53.250 --> 06:55.875
- I feel faint!
- Oh, Mother, sweet.

06:55.958 --> 06:56.791
Ugh!

06:59.208 --> 07:03.416
Let's face it.
This Willoughby family isn't great,

07:03.500 --> 07:05.833
and by the looks of it,
they never will be.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.083
<i>Not without a little help.</i>

07:09.791 --> 07:14.250
<i>Maybe it was the dark and stormy night,</i>
<i>maybe I've looked in one too many windows,</i>

07:14.333 --> 07:15.708

07:16.708 --> 07:20.750
<i>I know, narrators aren't supposed</i>
<i>to get involved, but just a little nudge.</i>

07:20.833 --> 07:22.458
<i>A well-timed cat's...</i>

07:39.083 --> 07:41.125
-Something's outside.
-Definitely something outside.

07:44.541 --> 07:45.958
-Jane.
-There's something outside.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.416
That's a yowl. A beastly yowl.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.833
Wow! What a mystery.
It's like we're in a book.

07:59.916 --> 08:01.125
-Come on, Barnabys.
- Bad book.

08:01.208 --> 08:02.666
- Scary book!

08:16.250 --> 08:17.791
Shh! They're still awake.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.541
-Dance, dance for your papa.

08:28.458 --> 08:30.250
What kind of a beast yowls like that?

08:31.625 --> 08:34.875
I'm really scared. Are you scared,
Barnabys? 'Cause I'm scared.

08:34.958 --> 08:36.166
Maybe we shouldn't--

08:36.250 --> 08:38.291
Do you remember that book
about beasts with all the drawings

08:38.375 --> 08:41.000
of teeth and claws
and huge piles of half-eaten kids?

08:41.083 --> 08:42.083
-Don't.
-Stop talking.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.458
It was a lot of blood,
wasn't it, Barnabys?

08:44.541 --> 08:46.000
-Blood is bad.
-I'm gonna have a quick look

08:46.083 --> 08:48.500
-to see if it's dangerous.

08:48.583 --> 08:51.666
If it is, run. Different directions,
zigzaggy and stuff.

08:51.750 --> 08:54.958
-So it can only eat one of you.
-What's this feeling I'm feeling?

08:55.041 --> 08:57.083
-Fear. Fear.
-Definitely fear.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.416
-Remember, twins, zigzaggy.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.958
Zigzag. Zigzag. Zigzag.

09:08.416 --> 09:11.875
Stand back, Barnabys.

09:12.833 --> 09:14.166
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>

09:14.250 --> 09:16.375
<i>'cause I'm thinking</i>
<i>exactly the same thing:</i>

09:17.000 --> 09:18.583
<i>What's in the box?</i>

09:18.666 --> 09:20.958
<i>And can we empty it so I can sit in it?</i>

09:21.666 --> 09:23.500
Hi, beast. I'm Jane.

09:24.375 --> 09:27.000
I hope you're a nice beast
because, um, we're nice.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.291
Please don't eat our faces.

09:49.875 --> 09:53.958
Father, I love the smell
of fresh yarn in the morning.

09:54.041 --> 09:57.708
-Gah! Parents already up? Despicable!

09:58.458 --> 10:02.250
Harvesting your mustache
makes such lovely yarn.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.916
-Do it!

10:06.000 --> 10:08.750
- Mmm-hmm.
-Ugh. How am I gonna get by?

10:08.833 --> 10:11.083
- Keep going.

10:11.166 --> 10:13.833
I knit, you provide. It's simple.

10:13.916 --> 10:16.291
- Was that always...

10:16.375 --> 10:19.791
Oh! You want Mother to have yarn,
don't you?

10:19.875 --> 10:21.958
You must. You like the sweaters.

10:22.041 --> 10:24.541
-Oh, pretty!

10:29.916 --> 10:31.708
There you go. Phew.

10:32.666 --> 10:33.791
Huh?

10:35.625 --> 10:37.791
Jane? Twins?

10:39.791 --> 10:42.041
Great Uncle Edmund! Shh!

10:42.125 --> 10:44.416
-They'll hear you.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.166
We must be quiet
while Mother and Father are still--

10:47.250 --> 10:49.083
-Tim!

10:49.166 --> 10:51.375
Here beastie, beastie, beastie.

10:51.458 --> 10:52.875
-Jane! What are you--
- Over there.

10:52.958 --> 10:53.791
Catch it.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.250
-Get it!
-Get it!

10:55.333 --> 10:57.333
Are you harboring a raccoon again?

10:57.416 --> 10:59.333
-Pfft. No.

10:59.416 --> 11:00.375
That is something!

11:00.458 --> 11:02.625
Is it more of a some or more of a thing?

11:02.708 --> 11:04.291
- Get it!
-What is that?

11:14.291 --> 11:16.291
-Aw!
-A baby!

11:16.375 --> 11:19.166
-No thumping!
-I can't knit!

11:19.250 --> 11:20.333
- Shh!

11:20.416 --> 11:22.000
Where did you get that thing?

11:22.083 --> 11:25.416
We found her outside, living in a box.
She's an orphan.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.708
-Smells like an orphan.
-Looks like an orphan.

11:26.791 --> 11:27.833
Got a box like an orphan.

11:27.916 --> 11:30.541
<i>♪ Orphan friend, box all alone ♪</i>

11:30.625 --> 11:32.125
-Why are you singing?
<i>-♪ We're glad you came here-- ♪</i>

11:32.208 --> 11:33.583
We are getting rid of it at once.

11:33.666 --> 11:34.958
- Give me that!

11:35.041 --> 11:36.666
- No!
-Gimme! Gimme!

11:36.750 --> 11:39.333
Jane! You know our parents hate children,

11:39.416 --> 11:41.583
and babies are the most
childish children of all!

11:41.666 --> 11:44.416
Well, I love her and nobody's gonna
take her away from me.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.291
-Barnabys, bring it to me.
- Yes, Tim.

11:46.375 --> 11:48.958
Hey! Barnabys, give me back my orphan.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.000
- You got it, Jane.
-Barnabys, thing.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.958
- Sorry, Tim.
-Barnabys, orphan.

11:53.041 --> 11:54.000
- Yes, Jane.
-Ah, Barnabys.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.125
- You got it, Tim.
-Barnabys.

11:55.208 --> 11:56.541
-Barnabys. Barnabys.
-Barnabys. Barnabys.

11:56.625 --> 11:58.875
Barnabys. Barnabys. Barnabys!

12:00.333 --> 12:01.958
Barnabys! Orphan?

12:02.041 --> 12:03.166
-Got away.
-Pretty fast.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.125
-What?

12:05.958 --> 12:07.375
The beast is loose!

12:20.125 --> 12:21.166
Oh, no, no, no!

12:24.208 --> 12:25.166
-Huh?

12:32.750 --> 12:34.708
-What is it?
-A baby.

12:34.791 --> 12:36.083
Oh, not again.

12:36.166 --> 12:38.708
-Why does this keep happening, Mother?
- Parents!

12:38.791 --> 12:41.750
How are you... Oh.
Parents, I got this. I got this.

12:41.833 --> 12:43.458
-Stay.

12:43.541 --> 12:46.208
Do not move a baby muscle.

12:46.291 --> 12:48.708
- Get it off. Get it off.

12:48.791 --> 12:51.000
Get it off! Get it off!

12:52.500 --> 12:53.750
-Ooh.
-Roasted baby.

12:53.833 --> 12:54.875
No!

12:57.333 --> 12:59.666
-Mother's balls are burning.
-No.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.083
-Yes.

13:02.500 --> 13:03.750
Ball burner.

13:06.541 --> 13:08.583
-Barnabys, catch her.

13:14.041 --> 13:15.416
No, no, no. Oh!

13:19.416 --> 13:22.208
-Gotcha, you little rascal.

13:22.291 --> 13:23.750
-Oh.

13:23.833 --> 13:27.166
-It's not even a Willoughby.
-Is this thing yours?

13:28.166 --> 13:30.041
-No.
-What? No, I didn't...

13:30.125 --> 13:33.916
You eat our food, sleep in our coal bin

13:34.000 --> 13:37.333
and now you expect us
to rear another child?

13:37.416 --> 13:39.666
-He's always doing this.
-What? No.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.625
-I mean, we've tried everything.
-Ignored him.

13:42.708 --> 13:44.291
-Coal bin.
-Neglected him.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.833
-Coal bin.
-It wasn't me.

13:45.916 --> 13:47.666
-Never played with him.
-Coal bin.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.500
-You'd think that would work!

13:49.583 --> 13:51.166
Nope! Nothing works.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.208
-I can't knit!

13:53.291 --> 13:56.583
Oh, Mother, sweet.

14:03.041 --> 14:06.583
-Children.
-I wish we could kick them all out.

14:06.666 --> 14:07.708
Ooh.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.375
-I've decided to kick you all out!
-Do it, Father.

14:12.458 --> 14:13.458
But my home!

14:13.541 --> 14:17.083
Do not return till that thing is gone!

14:17.166 --> 14:18.791
-You are...
-Do it. Do it.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.375
-...punished!
-Yes!

14:23.916 --> 14:26.708
-This is all your fault!
-What? It's their fault.

14:26.791 --> 14:28.375
We should kick them out.

14:28.458 --> 14:31.125
How will we restore honor
to House Willoughby

14:31.208 --> 14:34.333
if we are not living
in the Willoughby house?

14:34.416 --> 14:37.041
-Ugh. But--
-We have to get rid of it, fast.

14:37.125 --> 14:38.208
No, Tim!

14:40.166 --> 14:43.708
Oh, the ordeal is over.
Let us return to our home.

14:43.791 --> 14:46.250
-What? What? How!

14:46.333 --> 14:49.041
Tim, she needs a home,
and if we don't help her,

14:49.125 --> 14:50.708
we're as bad as our parents,

14:50.791 --> 14:53.458
who keep sullying
our great Willoughby name.

14:53.541 --> 14:56.833
They have sullied it so much.

14:56.916 --> 14:59.625
I know where we can find
the perfect home. Follow me.

14:59.708 --> 15:01.666
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hello, outside!

15:01.750 --> 15:05.166
Outside? But...  I've never...

15:07.250 --> 15:10.416
<i>I guess it's hard</i>
<i>to leave home for the first time.</i>

15:12.083 --> 15:15.333
<i>Although, I was six days old when I left.</i>

15:15.416 --> 15:16.708
<i>All my folks ever did for me</i>

15:16.791 --> 15:19.083
<i>was lick my eyeballs open,</i>
<i>sent me packin'.</i>

15:20.000 --> 15:22.375
<i>He'll be all right. Maybe.</i>

15:22.458 --> 15:26.000
-Jane! Where are we going?
-To the end of the rainbow.

15:26.083 --> 15:29.291
End of the rainbow? How far is that?

15:29.916 --> 15:32.541
Not far. Right, orphan friend?

15:43.625 --> 15:45.875
<i>Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.</i>

15:45.958 --> 15:50.750
<i>Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Walk.</i>

15:50.833 --> 15:52.458
- Ooh!
- Barnabys!

15:53.208 --> 15:55.250
Excuse me. Coming through.
Yep, sorry.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.166
Excuse me, excuse me.
Jane, the people! The people!

16:00.125 --> 16:01.250
This way.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.875
- Wait for me!

16:19.083 --> 16:21.166
- Yes! Over here.

16:23.333 --> 16:26.000
Jane! I got pee in my shoes.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.250
Are we getting close?

16:28.333 --> 16:30.291
- We're almost there.

16:30.375 --> 16:32.208
This looks like the bad part of town.

16:36.166 --> 16:37.583
Self-taught.

16:41.791 --> 16:44.166
-Look at that.

16:44.250 --> 16:47.583
Isn't it wonderful? The perfect home.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.041
<i>Usually</i>
<i>in old-fashioned stories,</i>

16:50.125 --> 16:52.958
<i>rainbows have treasure at the end,</i>
<i>don't they?</i>

16:53.833 --> 16:55.000
<i>Not this one.</i>

16:55.708 --> 16:59.416
"No trespassing"? Well, that's a bust.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.125
-Look! Duckies!
-Jane.

17:01.208 --> 17:02.875
- Factory!
-Barnabys!

17:02.958 --> 17:04.375
-No!

17:04.458 --> 17:07.625
- Hi, duckies! They're so chubby!

17:08.666 --> 17:12.500
- Barnabys! Jane!

17:12.583 --> 17:15.208
Willoughbys do not trespass!

17:15.791 --> 17:17.875
- The perfect home. Yay!

17:19.875 --> 17:23.500
- It's a candy factory!
- So many machines.

17:23.583 --> 17:24.916
So many buttons.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.333
-Levers. Levers. Levers.
-Buttons. Buttons. Buttons.

17:28.583 --> 17:31.291
<i>♪ Under the rainbow, I will spin ♪</i>

17:31.375 --> 17:34.333
<i>♪ The perfect home for my best friend ♪</i>

17:35.416 --> 17:36.833
-Wow!

17:38.125 --> 17:41.750
Rainbow food? This place has everything.

17:42.666 --> 17:46.291
-Hey!
-Orphan has a home. We go home.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.791
We can't just leave her outside.
It's not safe.

17:48.875 --> 17:51.250
What if there are... wolves?

17:51.333 --> 17:52.375
Wolves?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.666
- Here.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.833
You found her in a box?
We leave her in a box.

17:59.916 --> 18:02.875
-Wolves do hate boxes.
-Balance restored.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.708
Um, uh... Tim, wait!

18:08.208 --> 18:10.416
What if we gave her a name?

18:10.500 --> 18:14.000
A proper three-syllable name,
like, uh... oh, Taffeta!

18:14.083 --> 18:15.791
T-A-F-F-E--

18:16.375 --> 18:17.458
Hey!

18:17.541 --> 18:20.041
-Her name is Ruth.
- Ruth?

18:20.125 --> 18:24.500
Yes. Because re-orphaning her
makes us the ruthless Willoughbys.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.875
Now be ruthless and say goodbye.

18:31.000 --> 18:31.833
Okay.

18:33.875 --> 18:35.416
Oh, Ruth.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.125
I'll always know where to find you.
At the end of the rainbow.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.916
-To home!

18:43.333 --> 18:44.875
-Jane!

18:45.541 --> 18:48.708
Who disturbs my work?

18:48.791 --> 18:50.291
We're trespassing!

18:54.125 --> 18:55.125
Who--

18:58.375 --> 18:59.708
-Huh...

19:00.541 --> 19:03.000
What is in my box?

19:07.375 --> 19:10.041
Ruth? You're not candy.

19:17.291 --> 19:22.750
Such a magnificent mustache.
This is the perfect home.

19:32.166 --> 19:33.875
I really hope we're doing the right thing.

19:33.958 --> 19:35.500
Of course we are, Jane.

19:35.583 --> 19:39.041
A great man with a great home
must have a great family.

19:39.125 --> 19:42.583
Just imagine what
that lucky orphan's life will be like.

19:42.666 --> 19:45.250
Ugh. I wish we had a home like Ruth,

19:45.333 --> 19:47.833
where we didn't have to steal food
and nobody would say,

19:47.916 --> 19:48.958
"Shut up, Jane!"

19:49.041 --> 19:53.291
Oh, we would eat at a table
like the great Willoughbys of old.

19:53.375 --> 19:55.375
Our mustaches would grow long,

19:55.458 --> 19:59.041
and no one would ever have to go
to the coal bin again...

19:59.750 --> 20:01.458
unless they wanted coal.

20:01.541 --> 20:03.125
-I want a factory.
-Big factory.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.625
Wait. We could have all of that.

20:05.708 --> 20:07.375
-Except for the factory.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.291
-How?

20:09.375 --> 20:12.000
What if we became orphans?

20:12.083 --> 20:16.375
That is your iffiest what-if yet.
We have parents.

20:16.458 --> 20:17.500
-Bad parents.
-Terrible parents.

20:17.583 --> 20:20.250
But what if we didn't?
It's like in the books.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.583
Pollyanna's died of cholera in India.

20:22.666 --> 20:25.083
James, that peach fellow's parents
were eaten by a hippo.

20:25.166 --> 20:26.375
I thought it was a rhinoceros.

20:26.458 --> 20:29.458
Think about how great our family
could be if they were gone.

20:29.541 --> 20:32.083
Jane, are you seriously suggesting--

20:32.166 --> 20:34.250
We orphan ourselves. Yes!

20:34.333 --> 20:36.250
-Ghastly!
-Ruthless.

20:36.333 --> 20:39.166
No! Getting rid of an orphan is one thing.

20:39.250 --> 20:42.166
How do you propose
we discard of two insidious grown-ups?

20:42.250 --> 20:43.250
Easy.

20:45.041 --> 20:47.791
-No!
-No. Not there. There.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.416
- No!
- No. There.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.291
Wha...

21:03.541 --> 21:07.666
...$999, and all your troubles
will be gone for good.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.708
-You'll love it.
-Gone for good?

21:14.166 --> 21:17.375
A folded piece of shiny paper?

21:18.250 --> 21:24.791
We can send them away.
What if we orphaned ourselves?

21:24.875 --> 21:27.125
Yeah. Cracking idea, Tim.

21:27.208 --> 21:30.083
To home!

21:30.166 --> 21:32.083
I love this plan.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.791
Okay, humans, calm down.
Don't get all sensitive.

21:35.875 --> 21:39.291
"Ooh! This is bad."
It's nature. It'll work out.

21:40.333 --> 21:43.333
<i>Look, these kids needed a change. Y'know?</i>

21:43.416 --> 21:48.333
<i>I did warn you</i>
<i>this story wasn't all fluffy and fuzzy.</i>

21:48.416 --> 21:51.708
<i>Oh, blimey, those are sharp scissors.</i>
<i>Watch the eyes!</i>

21:51.791 --> 21:54.000
We shall craft a murderous adventure

21:54.083 --> 21:57.875
that gives our insidious parents
exactly what they want.

21:57.958 --> 21:59.875
-To be left alone with their love.

21:59.958 --> 22:04.500
Precisely. A romantic getaway,
hiding deadly orphaning opportunities.

22:05.375 --> 22:08.000
<i>If they do not melt</i>
<i>in the hottest places on Earth...</i>

22:10.416 --> 22:12.166
<i>...they shall drown in the wettest.</i>

22:13.666 --> 22:18.000
<i>Cannibals will feast</i>
<i>unless they freeze in glacial ice,</i>

22:18.833 --> 22:21.250
<i>or dissolve in fields of acid first.</i>

22:23.916 --> 22:27.166
<i>They shall not escape the bears,</i>
<i>but if they do,</i>

22:27.250 --> 22:29.541
we have saved
the deadliest spot for last...

22:29.625 --> 22:31.708
the Unclimbable Alp...

22:36.708 --> 22:40.291
-in Sveetzerlünd.

22:40.375 --> 22:42.833
He who goes up does not come down.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.208
The Reprehensible Travel Agency.

22:50.833 --> 22:54.250
No children allowed.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.666
-Behold!
-Wow.

23:17.166 --> 23:18.208
Mmm.

23:19.416 --> 23:21.458
Ah. Exquisite.

23:24.375 --> 23:26.125
-What?
-Hmm?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.083
-Father.
-Yes, poopsie.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.666
What is it?

23:47.958 --> 23:50.916
-Hmm.
-What does it say, Fatherkins?

23:52.375 --> 23:55.833
-"See the world."
-See the world?

23:55.916 --> 23:57.166
"Have adventures."

23:57.833 --> 24:01.583
I'd love to have an adventure!

24:01.666 --> 24:04.625
-You know what else, Mother?
-What, Father?

24:04.708 --> 24:07.416
No children allowed!

24:07.500 --> 24:11.375
I would love that.

24:11.958 --> 24:14.250
Do the hula, my love.

24:15.583 --> 24:18.708
You make me spin whirlybird style.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.208
No. Stop. Wait.

24:20.291 --> 24:26.083
If we leave these children here alone,
they'll ruin everything.

24:26.166 --> 24:27.125
Oh.

24:28.166 --> 24:31.416
What if we didn't
leave them here alone? Huh?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.750
We could get them a nanny.

24:34.833 --> 24:38.125
But aren't good nannies expensive?

24:38.208 --> 24:43.041
Yes, Mother. So we'll hire
a not-good nanny for cheap.

24:44.208 --> 24:46.916
<i>To adventure.</i>
<i>Are they gullible or what?</i>

24:47.000 --> 24:49.750
<i>I mean, I never thought</i>
<i>they'd fall for it. Did you?</i>

24:49.833 --> 24:53.541
Oh, you are my muse, flipsy-poop. Mmm.

24:53.625 --> 24:56.666
Now that's gonna be a fun ride.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.583
-Go on, pick me up.

24:58.666 --> 25:00.375
Put me in sideways.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.125
Mother's been friends
with her fork.

25:03.041 --> 25:03.875
Well, that was easy.

25:03.958 --> 25:06.333
- To adventure!
- Ooh!

25:06.416 --> 25:07.958
Everyone got what they wanted.

25:08.041 --> 25:09.500
To adventure!

25:10.125 --> 25:11.791
- All good.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.833
Told you this would work out.

25:16.375 --> 25:18.166
They're gone? We did it.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.583
-We...
-Are...

25:19.666 --> 25:21.375
- Orphans!

25:22.416 --> 25:24.083
- Whee-hee!

25:33.041 --> 25:35.041
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

25:35.750 --> 25:38.041
Orphan home. Orphan home.

25:44.666 --> 25:46.291
Whoo!

25:46.375 --> 25:47.333
Whoo!

26:29.750 --> 26:30.916
Hmm...

26:31.708 --> 26:33.541
You are punished!

26:39.958 --> 26:42.416
Great Edmund, enjoy thy wall.

26:43.083 --> 26:46.625
<i> Willoughby...</i>

26:49.000 --> 26:52.458
<i>Timothy,</i>
<i>you are the man of the house!</i>

26:53.083 --> 26:58.250
<i>With great responsibility</i>
<i>comes great mustache.</i>

27:01.166 --> 27:05.250
<i>Tim, Tim, Tim...</i>

27:05.333 --> 27:07.208
<i>Tim, Tim, Tim.</i>

27:07.291 --> 27:09.000
- Tim.

27:09.083 --> 27:10.958
- Tim!

27:12.375 --> 27:15.541
-Tim!
- Is it morning?

27:15.625 --> 27:17.750
-We're hungry.
-Haven't eaten in hours.

27:17.833 --> 27:19.250
-Days. Starving.
-What's food?

27:21.041 --> 27:27.166
I hear your childish needs,
and as man of the house, I will provide.

27:28.208 --> 27:30.250
<i>See?</i>
<i>Told you this would all work out.</i>

27:31.583 --> 27:33.833
Let the greatness begin.

27:34.625 --> 27:35.666
<i>Oh, Tim.</i>

27:48.833 --> 27:50.916
Warm thy Willoughby self.

28:01.166 --> 28:02.583
Simply divine.

28:12.208 --> 28:14.500
Dinner is served!

28:15.125 --> 28:18.875
A proper meal for a proper family.

28:18.958 --> 28:24.250
Delicious lobster on a bed of coal! Ta-da!

28:24.916 --> 28:27.750
Tim, is that from the wall?

28:27.833 --> 28:29.291
-Old lobster.
-Really old.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.625
Old food
is the best food.

28:38.750 --> 28:39.958
I'm going.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.833
What? You're skipping the cheese plate?

28:44.416 --> 28:45.666
Charcuterie mouse!

28:45.750 --> 28:47.375
-This is getting weird.
-I pass.

28:47.458 --> 28:48.416
<i>I'll eat it.</i>

28:48.500 --> 28:50.416
What? Hey!

28:51.000 --> 28:52.458
Where the Willoughby are you going?

28:52.541 --> 28:54.958
Out. Ruth has rainbow food
at her place and--

28:55.041 --> 28:59.291
We did not orphan ourselves
so you could go toodle-doodling,

28:59.375 --> 29:02.166
eating fancy rainbow food
with your friends.

29:02.250 --> 29:04.291
I am an orphan and I do what I want.

29:04.375 --> 29:05.791
-No, you can't.
-I can.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.708
-You shan't.
-I shan!

29:07.791 --> 29:09.958
-No, you--
-Hello!

29:10.041 --> 29:11.541
-Stranger.
-Danger.

29:11.625 --> 29:12.875
Trespasser!

29:12.958 --> 29:18.375
Fear not, skinny orange boy,
for I am your nanny!

29:18.458 --> 29:19.916
No, I'm in charge!

29:20.000 --> 29:22.541
I've read about nannies.
What kind of nanny are you?

29:22.625 --> 29:25.041
Did you fly in on the east wind
or the west?

29:25.125 --> 29:26.041
-West.
-Where's your umbrella?

29:26.125 --> 29:27.166
-Here.
-Do you eat children?

29:27.250 --> 29:28.583
-Sometimes.
-Why are you here?

29:28.666 --> 29:31.583
I was hired by your loving parents.

29:31.666 --> 29:32.666
-Loving?

29:32.750 --> 29:33.791
Parents?

29:34.666 --> 29:38.583
I've got no qualifications,
but a cheery disposition.

29:39.166 --> 29:45.083
Here to service all your childish needs.
I cook, clean...  sing!

29:45.166 --> 29:47.541
What? You sing?

29:47.625 --> 29:51.250
-Yeah! All nannies sing.
-I sing, too.

29:51.333 --> 29:55.500
What if we sing together?

29:55.583 --> 29:56.458
Yeah!

30:00.833 --> 30:02.000
Everybody, come on!

30:06.625 --> 30:08.833
Never trust a nanny.

30:12.750 --> 30:13.791
- Ow!

30:13.875 --> 30:15.625
Whoa!

30:15.708 --> 30:18.666
- This is amazing.
-Yay!

30:18.750 --> 30:20.958
-Insidious!
- I love it!

30:21.041 --> 30:22.375
What is she doing
to Jane's head?

30:22.458 --> 30:25.458
- Now it's pointy.
- And she looks younger.

30:25.541 --> 30:26.583
Devil woman.

30:29.208 --> 30:31.458
-We have to get rid of her.
- Rid of her?

30:31.541 --> 30:33.083
-Fast.
- Ooh.

30:33.166 --> 30:36.791
Nanny is working for our parents,
and now she's brainwashed Jane.

30:36.875 --> 30:41.666
She has to go. But how?
Perhaps another brochure.

30:41.750 --> 30:43.791
-How about this, Tim?
-It'll work.

30:43.875 --> 30:46.208
What the Willoughby is that?

30:46.791 --> 30:49.250
- It's a nannapult, Tim.
-Nannapult?

30:49.333 --> 30:51.750
Nanny goes here, in the nanny-cup.

30:53.041 --> 30:53.875
Lever.

30:59.333 --> 31:01.166
-Nanny gone.
-Problem solved.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.583
Whoa!

31:02.666 --> 31:05.791
This is... a terrible idea.

31:05.875 --> 31:07.916
First off, too many levers.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.958
Do you honestly think
she's just gonna walk right in here

31:11.041 --> 31:13.125
and plop herself down in your nanny-cup?

31:14.291 --> 31:15.916
This is the library.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.583
The twins mostly do stuff here.

31:17.666 --> 31:22.375
Wow.
Did you little mushroom heads make this?

31:22.458 --> 31:25.166
A bouncy chair?

31:25.250 --> 31:27.583
-Whoa, it looks like a nanny-cup.
-Bouncy...

31:27.666 --> 31:31.916
You guys are like little baby
Albert Einsteins but with weirder hair.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.708
-What are your names?
- Lever.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.458
-That's Barnaby.
-And that's Barnaby.

31:35.541 --> 31:37.750
-Both of you? Okay.
- Pull it.

31:37.833 --> 31:40.833
What if I call you Barnaby A?

31:40.916 --> 31:43.000
- Do it!
-And you're Barnaby B?

31:43.083 --> 31:44.458
-Lever!
-I can tell them apart now.

31:44.541 --> 31:46.083
-I like B.
-I like A.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.625
-I love all the levers! Or is it leaver?
-No, no, no.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.125
-Lever.
-No, leaver.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.125
Can I pull it?

31:54.375 --> 31:57.583
Whoa! Fun. Ooh, what's this one do?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
-Nothing, huh?

32:02.083 --> 32:04.125
-Who's hungry?
- Yay!

32:06.250 --> 32:08.041
Stupid nannapult.

32:09.291 --> 32:13.875
Not great. Oh, look at them over there,
chewing food in their mouths,

32:13.958 --> 32:15.791
-eating it up. Ugh!
- Skinny Bones?

32:19.041 --> 32:20.833
-What's his deal?
-Jealous.

32:20.916 --> 32:24.000
-Definitely jealous.
-Yeah. It's a classic power struggle.

32:24.083 --> 32:25.250
Hmm.

32:25.333 --> 32:29.166
Traitorous Willoughbys.
More like Will-not-be's.

32:29.250 --> 32:31.000
Will not eat Tim's food.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.250
-Hey, Tim.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.500
I know you miss
your old-fashioned parents.

32:36.083 --> 32:40.875
Change is hard. I've been there.
I think maybe you just need to eat.

32:40.958 --> 32:43.250
-What? No, no, no.
- Come on. Here we go.

32:47.666 --> 32:50.291
-Hmm.
-Put some oats on those skinny bones.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.708
Tim, you have to try this. It's so good.
Way better than that wall lobster.

32:55.791 --> 33:00.000
Willoughbys do not eat oats.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.375
I know you can do this, Skinny Bones.
Now eat.

33:09.791 --> 33:10.916
No, thank you.

33:12.416 --> 33:14.500
-Eat.
-Nope.

33:14.583 --> 33:15.625
-Eat.
-No.

33:15.708 --> 33:16.833
- Stop it.
-You stop it.

33:16.916 --> 33:17.750
- Let go.
-You let go.

33:17.833 --> 33:19.791
-Eat.
-No!

33:26.291 --> 33:29.750
You disrespect my oats, you disrespect me.

33:31.166 --> 33:33.916
I have no choice but to put you in...

33:35.416 --> 33:39.250
The coal bin? I was gonna say time-out.

33:39.916 --> 33:43.666
You know, I have no choice
but to put you in a time-out.

33:44.666 --> 33:48.875
Why in the world would your parents
ever put you in a coal bin?

33:48.958 --> 33:50.166
Having childish needs.

33:50.250 --> 33:51.458
-Like food.
-Sweaters.

33:51.541 --> 33:52.500
Love.

33:52.583 --> 33:53.833
Oh, taking in an orphan.

33:53.916 --> 33:56.958
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You took in an orphan?

33:57.041 --> 33:58.250
Yeah, we did.

33:58.333 --> 34:02.458
But she was a baby, and babies
are the most childish children, so...

34:02.541 --> 34:03.458
We got rid of her.

34:03.541 --> 34:08.250
What? Back up the abuse caboose.
Where'd you get rid of a baby?

34:10.375 --> 34:11.833
The perfect home.

34:11.916 --> 34:16.250
Oh, this is the worst home ever.
Poor little orphan.

34:16.333 --> 34:20.791
We should not be trespassing.
Disturbing this great man's work.

34:20.875 --> 34:22.541
What great man?

34:22.625 --> 34:25.750
- Who disturbs my work?

34:28.208 --> 34:32.125
Wait a minute. Commander Melanoff is real?

34:32.208 --> 34:34.000
Um, yes.

34:34.083 --> 34:38.791
Wow. That is a...
That's a strong fashion choice.

34:38.875 --> 34:41.541
-Do you dress like that every day, sir?
-I, uh...

34:41.625 --> 34:44.375
-Are those medals candy?
-Uh, maybe.

34:44.458 --> 34:47.250
-Can Ruth come out?
-No! Go away!

34:47.333 --> 34:50.416
-Hey! Hey! Where's the orphan, candy man?
-Shh.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.791
- No!
-Baby!

34:52.875 --> 34:54.500
-Ruth!
- Factory!

34:54.583 --> 34:56.750
- Oh, diddly-do.

34:57.333 --> 34:59.208
-May I touch your mustache?
-What?

34:59.291 --> 35:01.666
-Uh-oh.

35:02.250 --> 35:05.750
-Baby? Where is she?
- Ruth!

35:07.583 --> 35:08.625
This is bad.

35:10.375 --> 35:12.750
We have to get her
before she has a sugar crash.

35:12.833 --> 35:17.208
Oh, no, no, no. Not again.
You trespassers! Stay!

35:17.291 --> 35:18.708
Yes, great one.

35:20.625 --> 35:25.708
Oh, baby. No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

35:25.791 --> 35:29.000
Nuts and nougat,
nuts and nougat.

35:34.250 --> 35:36.250
Oh, diddly-doodle.

35:50.083 --> 35:52.333
Ah! Not the candy crusher.

36:02.291 --> 36:04.583
Ruthie!

36:08.875 --> 36:10.916
Gotcha!

36:11.000 --> 36:14.458
-Ooh, that was exciting.
-Okay, but we're supposed to be staying.

36:15.833 --> 36:18.041
Ruth!

36:18.125 --> 36:22.125
You! Big-haired lady.
Give me back my baby!

36:22.208 --> 36:25.625
Your baby? I don't think so, sugar daddy.

36:25.708 --> 36:27.375
A nanny knows things,

36:27.458 --> 36:32.708
and this nanny knows these messed-up
Willoughbys left a baby on your doorstep.

36:32.791 --> 36:38.750
Wait, are you the angels
who brought her to me?

36:38.833 --> 36:40.625
- Uh...
-Maybe.

36:40.708 --> 36:42.625
I wouldn't call them angels, exactly.

36:47.333 --> 36:50.333
-Oh, my.
-What are you feeding her?

36:50.416 --> 36:57.041
<i>Candy! I'm Commander Melanoff,</i>
<i>and I live in the land of fun!</i>

36:57.125 --> 36:59.500
-Whoa.
-A moving painting?

36:59.583 --> 37:02.291
How did they get
the tiny people in the box?

37:02.375 --> 37:06.458
Ruthie likes it, don't ya?
You like those toasty oats.

37:06.541 --> 37:07.833
All kids love oats.

37:10.375 --> 37:14.000
So, you're like the real
Commander Melanoff? You're famous?

37:14.625 --> 37:20.541
Well, maybe.
I do make every tasty treat myself.

37:21.166 --> 37:22.916
Do you live here alone, or...

37:23.000 --> 37:25.416
Yes. Well, I did.

37:25.500 --> 37:30.500
Ruth moved in
and she needs a lot of attention.

37:30.583 --> 37:33.500
'Course she does, don't you, baby girl?

37:33.583 --> 37:37.083
How could something so tiny
make so much poop?

37:37.166 --> 37:40.958
-I haven't slept in nine days.
-Oh, that explains a lot.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.458
I called Orphan Services for help, but--

37:43.541 --> 37:46.625
Orphan Services?
No, you shouldn't have called them!

37:46.708 --> 37:49.750
Well, I mean, "Find an orphan
you don't know, call--"

37:49.833 --> 37:51.458
-Oh, oh.
-Oh, oh.

37:51.541 --> 37:56.833
No. Giving a baby to them
is like locking a puppy up in a cage.

37:56.916 --> 37:59.625
Oh, my! I love puppies.

38:00.375 --> 38:02.500
It's a good thing I hung up, then.

38:02.583 --> 38:04.041
Oh, you did?

38:04.125 --> 38:09.166
You see, I've grown fond
of her childish needs.

38:10.125 --> 38:13.375
I want her to stay.

38:13.916 --> 38:16.208
- Okay, but...

38:16.291 --> 38:19.250
This factory isn't baby proofed.

38:19.333 --> 38:22.625
She can't just eat candy
for the rest of her life.

38:22.708 --> 38:26.333
I mean, next thing you know,
she's going off to college, she could...

38:26.416 --> 38:30.291
She could be a doctor.
Maybe she'll write the next <i>Moby Dick,</i>

38:31.083 --> 38:34.875
or paint the next <i>Mona Lisa.</i>
Fly an airplane to the moon.

38:34.958 --> 38:37.166
I mean, she could be the next president.

38:37.750 --> 38:40.416
You know? And then you're gonna
have to go to the White House

38:40.500 --> 38:45.250
and maybe not wear a candy suit,
you know? It's a lot.

38:46.583 --> 38:49.583
That sounds sweet.

38:49.666 --> 38:54.875
It's time for this candy man
to become a family man,

38:56.208 --> 38:58.083
-who also makes candy.

38:58.166 --> 39:00.791
Well, if you ever need help,
you know who to call.

39:00.875 --> 39:02.958
Oh, the service for orphans.

39:03.041 --> 39:06.416
What? No, Skinny Bones!

39:06.500 --> 39:10.083
You could call me. You know, I'm a nanny.

39:10.166 --> 39:13.000
-I will.
-Just put your number in there.

39:13.083 --> 39:17.208
If you ever need a candy factory, or--
Ooh!

39:17.291 --> 39:19.750
Yay! The perfect home.

39:22.208 --> 39:26.791
Oh,
you Willoughbys are wonderful.

39:26.875 --> 39:28.625
Here, son, catch!

39:34.083 --> 39:36.041
- Whoa.

39:36.125 --> 39:39.250
-Is this a hug?
-I don't know. But I like it.

39:46.166 --> 39:51.750
Aww. Unfortunately, these Willoughby kids
would soon get some disturbing news

39:51.833 --> 39:55.000
that their parents were still alive.

40:01.458 --> 40:04.958
<i>They say that love conquers all.</i>
<i>It does for these two.</i>

40:28.041 --> 40:30.333
<i>How many lives</i>
<i>have these cats got?</i>

40:32.458 --> 40:36.916
Oh, Father, I do so love
adventuring with you.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.500
- Oh!
-Bug.

40:38.583 --> 40:44.458
Unfortunately, Mother, our adventuring
is soon to be over. We are broke.

40:44.541 --> 40:46.833
Does that mean we'll have to...

40:46.916 --> 40:49.416
Ugh. Go home. I'm afraid so.

40:49.500 --> 40:53.583
You mean, back to that old-fashioned home?

40:53.666 --> 40:55.791
-Yes.
-Oh!

40:55.875 --> 41:00.875
If only there was a way that we could
reach across time and space

41:00.958 --> 41:03.125
-and just sell it.

41:03.208 --> 41:05.375
Uh, you could always use the Internet.

41:06.375 --> 41:08.208
-Ina--
-Nets?

41:08.291 --> 41:12.000
Uh, see here. Old-fashioned homes go
for a lot these days.

41:14.083 --> 41:15.625
-Oh, my.

41:15.708 --> 41:16.833
Piranhas!

41:16.916 --> 41:20.333
-What in blue blazers is this thing?
- So many pictures.

41:20.416 --> 41:21.916
Ooh. I get it.

41:22.791 --> 41:24.083
<i>Irene Holmes.</i>

41:24.166 --> 41:26.791
Hello, we'd like to sell
our old-fashioned house.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.625
-Quickly. Tell her quickly.
-Immediately.

<i>Taking us home ♪</i>

I'm glad you had fun, Tim.

42:11.916 --> 42:14.958
-Must be the Commander texting already.

42:15.041 --> 42:16.083
- <i>Nanny...</i>

42:17.583 --> 42:19.083
What? Father?

42:19.791 --> 42:21.083
<i>As you wish.</i>

42:34.250 --> 42:35.458
Huh...

42:41.583 --> 42:43.833
"Slide to unlock."

42:43.916 --> 42:45.958
Okay, yeah.

42:47.208 --> 42:49.125
Why is it not work--

42:54.583 --> 42:55.666
Yes!

43:00.166 --> 43:02.958
- <i>Nanny! We're selling the house.</i>
-Huh?

43:04.083 --> 43:06.791
She's working for our still-alive parents!

43:09.000 --> 43:14.083
-Tim, you're acting weird.
-Oh, am I?

43:14.166 --> 43:15.375
<i>We're selling the house.</i>

43:15.458 --> 43:19.708
<i>-Dispose of the children as you wish.</i>
-<i> Do it, Father.</i>

43:19.791 --> 43:21.291
No.

43:21.375 --> 43:25.875
Oh, yeah. And here's what
that Nanny wrote back.

43:25.958 --> 43:27.541
"As for the children...

43:27.625 --> 43:29.666
I will take care of them."

43:31.208 --> 43:34.416
-Do you wanna be taken care of?
-I do not.

43:35.291 --> 43:37.166
-Oh, no.

43:37.875 --> 43:39.625
Money!

43:42.750 --> 43:44.625
Another trespasser!

43:45.416 --> 43:46.500
Money!

43:48.041 --> 43:50.333
-Hello!

43:50.416 --> 43:53.958
Open house tomorrow.
I'm gonna sell your home.

43:54.041 --> 43:56.625
Money!

43:57.500 --> 43:59.666
Oh, no, you won't.

44:01.875 --> 44:03.666
<i>Who could sleep</i>
<i>on a night like this?</i>

44:04.291 --> 44:07.250
<i>Well, I could, actually.</i>
<i>I'm a great sleeper.</i>

44:07.333 --> 44:09.416
<i>But these Willoughby kids can't.</i>

44:22.125 --> 44:23.500
Go, go, go.

44:35.625 --> 44:38.791
-Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

44:38.875 --> 44:41.458
- <i>Orphan Services.</i>
-Oh, uh...

44:41.541 --> 44:45.250
Hello, I'm an orphan in need of service.

44:45.333 --> 44:48.666
I'd like to report a bad nanny.

44:49.541 --> 44:50.875
Oh-oh.

44:53.958 --> 44:56.791
- Ding-dong!

44:56.875 --> 45:02.500
The house is open!
Buy it. Buy it. Buy it. Buy it.

45:02.583 --> 45:04.958
Like mice nibbling
at the edge of a trap,

45:05.041 --> 45:09.958
these hopeful people were about to get
caught in the war of the Willoughbys.

45:14.041 --> 45:15.708
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

45:26.166 --> 45:28.333
-Exquisite!

45:29.166 --> 45:30.333
Oof!

45:30.416 --> 45:31.708
Ha-ha.

45:36.250 --> 45:38.625
Huh?

45:44.416 --> 45:46.708
Oof!

45:51.750 --> 45:52.875
Huh?

46:09.250 --> 46:10.083
Hey.

46:15.208 --> 46:16.041
-Yes!
- Help!

46:17.916 --> 46:19.250
Worst open house!

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Darn it!

46:22.416 --> 46:27.083
Well done, Willoughbys.
Today, we saved our home!

46:32.208 --> 46:34.833
<i>While the Willoughbys</i>
<i>defended their home bravely...</i>

46:34.916 --> 46:35.958
Whoa. Where you going?

46:36.041 --> 46:37.625
<i>...they were no match for this.</i>

46:37.708 --> 46:40.583
Welcome. Right this way.

46:40.666 --> 46:42.916
Would you look at that house?

46:47.291 --> 46:48.958
<i>The perfect family.</i>

46:49.041 --> 46:51.333
<i>♪ Perfect family ♪ </i>

46:51.416 --> 46:52.958
It's what we've always dreamed of.

46:53.041 --> 46:54.791
Looks like home, sweetie!

46:56.666 --> 46:59.541
- Insidious. Go.

46:59.625 --> 47:01.416
There's space for my roses.

47:01.500 --> 47:04.166
- <i>♪ Ooh, roses ♪</i>
-Big sister, I love you so much.

47:04.250 --> 47:06.000
No, I love you so much, little brother.

47:06.083 --> 47:08.500
We love you, too, kids.

47:08.583 --> 47:09.458
Yay!

47:10.500 --> 47:11.791
Whoo!

47:11.875 --> 47:14.458
I feel a tingle
of domestic joy!

47:14.541 --> 47:16.708
- <i>♪ Tingle ♪</i>

47:16.791 --> 47:20.541
-This house is wonderful!
- <i>♪ Ooh, wonderful ♪</i>

47:20.625 --> 47:23.125

-We could be so happy here.

47:26.458 --> 47:30.458
Whoa!

47:30.541 --> 47:32.875
We are definitely buying this house.

47:32.958 --> 47:34.625
- <i>♪ Buying this house ♪</i>
-We be great.

47:34.708 --> 47:35.791
But they be perfect.

47:35.875 --> 47:37.333
Come on.

47:37.416 --> 47:39.750
It's like the Willoughby massacre
of 1775--

47:41.000 --> 47:42.291
Trespassers!

47:44.791 --> 47:48.166
- It's haunted!

47:48.250 --> 47:51.333
-I love you!

47:56.375 --> 47:58.916
-Something scared the perfect family?

47:59.000 --> 48:01.041
-Beastly.
- Definitely a monster.

48:17.333 --> 48:18.416
We'll just take a look.

48:18.500 --> 48:20.333
Jane! No, no, no.

48:20.416 --> 48:21.583
Shh.

48:24.541 --> 48:26.291
What happened to our library?

48:28.375 --> 48:30.333
- I'm scared.
- Definitely scared.

48:30.416 --> 48:31.833
What the Willoughby?

48:39.416 --> 48:45.291
I am the Willoughby beast.
Enter my home and I shall feast!

48:45.375 --> 48:47.208
-Eat one of the Barnabys.

48:47.291 --> 48:48.875
Zigzag. Zigzag. Zigzag.

48:48.958 --> 48:50.875
Leave this place and you be free,

48:50.958 --> 48:54.791
unless thou be a Willoughby!

48:54.875 --> 48:57.166
Zigzag. Zigzag.
It's not working.

48:57.250 --> 48:59.750
I be a Willoughby.

49:00.333 --> 49:02.166
Is that so?

49:02.250 --> 49:05.500
Then I guess we're cool...

49:05.583 --> 49:07.375
Skinny Bones.

49:07.958 --> 49:08.791
Nanny?

49:08.875 --> 49:12.458
Here to serve the little children.

49:12.541 --> 49:14.875
-Yay! I knew you were good.

49:14.958 --> 49:15.875
Rubbery arms!

49:15.958 --> 49:17.458
But I locked you up in your room.

49:17.541 --> 49:20.791
Oh, come on, Tim.
All nannies know how to pick a lock.

49:20.875 --> 49:21.875
Ooh.

49:21.958 --> 49:24.541
I was building this all night
'cause I really wanted to help.

49:24.625 --> 49:29.791
Help who? Our parents?
We can't trust her. Remember this, Nanny?

49:29.875 --> 49:31.583
"As for the children,

49:31.666 --> 49:33.583
I will take care of them."

49:34.583 --> 49:36.500
Why are you being all evil?

49:36.583 --> 49:38.500
Hear it in my voice, okay?

49:38.583 --> 49:42.500
As for the children,
let me take care of them.

49:42.583 --> 49:43.416
Oh.

49:43.500 --> 49:46.375
When you say it like that,
I do wanna be taken care of.

49:46.958 --> 49:53.458
Tim, I might work for your parents,
but my duty is to look after you guys.

49:54.041 --> 49:56.458
I should have told you
they were selling the house.

49:56.541 --> 49:58.000
I'm sorry.

49:58.083 --> 50:01.666
But I just couldn't bear to break
your weird little hearts.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.791
Oh, thank you, Nanny.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

50:04.875 --> 50:05.833
Any time, tiny girlfriend.

50:05.916 --> 50:07.416
- Wanna hug Nanny.
- Huggy.

50:07.500 --> 50:09.166
Get in here, you little mushroom heads.

50:09.250 --> 50:13.125
- Hug us will all six arms.

50:15.333 --> 50:17.958
Tim, are you okay?

50:19.083 --> 50:20.291
Thank you.

50:25.708 --> 50:27.833
Aww, Skinny Bones.

50:27.916 --> 50:29.541
-Huh?

50:30.250 --> 50:31.583
- What?

50:32.125 --> 50:34.250
<i>Department of Orphan Services is on site.</i>

50:34.333 --> 50:38.208
<i>-Unit 4. Cut off the exits.</i>
-Orphan Services? We have to go. Now!

50:38.291 --> 50:39.458
<i>No children in or out.</i>

50:40.083 --> 50:42.041
Hurry, kids. Stick with me. Come on.

50:42.125 --> 50:43.541
- Where are we going?
-Back door.

50:43.625 --> 50:46.333
-No, follow me. Come on, you two.
-Nanny, what's happening?

50:47.875 --> 50:51.041
It's okay. Stay together. Come on.
Come on. Don't panic.

50:59.083 --> 51:03.750
We have reason to believe
a bad nanny is harboring orphans.

51:03.833 --> 51:04.750
Orphans?

51:04.833 --> 51:08.083
As a Willoughby,
I demand you leave our home.

51:08.166 --> 51:10.125
You're the orphan.

51:10.208 --> 51:11.083
Yes.

51:11.166 --> 51:14.125
No, no, no. They have parents.
You leave them alone.

51:14.208 --> 51:17.708
Linda? Is that you?

51:17.791 --> 51:19.291
Uh, yeah.

51:19.375 --> 51:22.291
-Linda?
-But I'm a nanny now.

51:22.375 --> 51:24.916
Are you wearing toilet paper again?

51:25.000 --> 51:26.875
Yes, I am, but it--

51:26.958 --> 51:29.041
Oh, you look ridiculous.

51:29.125 --> 51:30.583
It's a costume. I was...

51:30.666 --> 51:32.791
Once an orphan, always an orphan.

51:32.875 --> 51:33.916
Uh...

51:34.000 --> 51:35.916
Nanny? You're an orphan?

51:36.000 --> 51:39.208
No, I mean, I was. I mean... I...

51:39.291 --> 51:41.125
I am.

51:41.208 --> 51:44.583
We tried to find her a home,
but no one ever wanted her.

51:44.666 --> 51:46.708
That's not true. We want her.

51:46.791 --> 51:48.750
See? They want me.

51:48.833 --> 51:50.250
Oh, Linda.

51:50.958 --> 51:56.166
<i>I'd like to report</i>
<i>a bad nanny. We do not want her.</i>

51:56.250 --> 51:57.250
Tim?

51:57.333 --> 51:59.375
That's you? Your voice?

51:59.458 --> 52:01.000
-Tim.
-How could you?

52:01.083 --> 52:02.125
No, no--

52:02.208 --> 52:05.750
Oh, children can be so, so cruel.

52:05.833 --> 52:07.500
-I didn't mean--
-You did.

52:07.583 --> 52:09.458
I was just trying to be a good nanny.

52:09.541 --> 52:12.250
-But you are--
-No longer required.

52:13.416 --> 52:15.458
-No, you are required.

52:15.541 --> 52:18.791
Go, Linda,
before these children hurt you more.

52:20.083 --> 52:22.666
Nanny, don't. Please!

52:25.541 --> 52:26.500
Jane...

52:27.166 --> 52:28.666
You did this.

52:28.750 --> 52:30.125
I didn't mean--

52:30.208 --> 52:32.958
You lied about Nanny.
You made me get rid of Ruth.

52:33.041 --> 52:34.000
That was our parents.

52:34.083 --> 52:36.500
-Always just bossing me around.
-Jane--

52:36.583 --> 52:39.416
You're a mean,
mustacheless, short-panted--

52:39.500 --> 52:42.041
- No!
-Fighting children must be separated.

52:42.125 --> 52:43.416
You can't.

52:43.500 --> 52:44.541
For your own good.

52:44.625 --> 52:46.208
No!

52:49.041 --> 52:52.041
You will adopt
standard childhood experiences.

52:52.125 --> 52:55.333
Homes will be allocated.
Schools will be assigned.

52:55.416 --> 53:00.583
Until your biological parents return,
you are officially orphans.

53:00.666 --> 53:01.583
No!

53:01.666 --> 53:03.250
Have a nice childhood.

53:03.333 --> 53:06.000
Stop! I don't want to go!

53:06.083 --> 53:09.916
Help! I don't wanna go!
Let me out! Let me out!

53:10.000 --> 53:11.583
- Tim?
- Jane?

53:11.666 --> 53:12.833
Please. You can't do this.

53:12.916 --> 53:15.250
<i>All children</i>
<i>collected and protected.</i>

53:15.333 --> 53:16.250
-No.
<i>-Good work, team.</i>

53:20.666 --> 53:26.750
These poor kids. Alone, scattered, lost.

53:29.666 --> 53:31.250
Like me, really.

53:33.041 --> 53:35.333
The Barnabys were cared for
in a modern home,

53:36.083 --> 53:39.958
<i>plugged into the Internet,</i>
<i>their little brains flooded with...</i>

53:40.041 --> 53:42.333
<i>Well, you've been on the Internet. </i>

53:47.291 --> 53:50.041
<i>Jane's hosts believed in</i>
<i>the healing power of music.</i>

53:50.125 --> 53:53.000
You okay, kiddo?

53:55.041 --> 53:56.875
<i>But Jane's song was gone.</i>

53:58.500 --> 54:01.458
<i>Her what-ifs? No more.</i>

54:03.416 --> 54:08.000
<i>Tim resisted change, running away from</i>
<i>well-meaning families like the Wilsons,</i>

54:08.791 --> 54:10.083
<i>the Walters,</i>

54:10.708 --> 54:12.458
<i>the Waddingtons.</i>

54:13.791 --> 54:17.208
<i>He wanted his old-fashioned</i>
<i>Willoughby life back.</i>

54:18.625 --> 54:20.708
Sold?

54:23.125 --> 54:26.625
No, no, no, no!

54:27.625 --> 54:28.791
<i>But it was gone.</i>

54:33.041 --> 54:37.500
<i>No home. No family.</i>
<i>Someone's gotta look after him.</i>

54:38.291 --> 54:40.916
<i>This is unit three.</i>
<i>We have him.</i>

54:41.000 --> 54:43.083
<i>It's tough out there,</i>
<i>in the city.</i>

54:44.208 --> 54:47.375
<i>Sometimes, you're the cat.</i>
<i>Sometimes, you're the mouse.</i>

54:48.333 --> 54:49.583
<i>At least he's got a box.</i>

54:55.666 --> 54:59.041
<i>Okay, it's a bit dark, but, uh, y'know.</i>

55:01.750 --> 55:05.833
<i>Poor Nanny tucked her tail</i>
<i>and ran away from her past.</i>

55:05.916 --> 55:07.541
<i>Y'know, never look back.</i>

55:09.166 --> 55:12.083
<i>'Course, it's nobody's fault, really.</i>

55:15.708 --> 55:18.666
<i>Fine. I'll stop the bus.</i>

55:24.250 --> 55:25.666
<i>Happy now?</i>

55:27.833 --> 55:31.333
Let me off. Let me off!

55:31.916 --> 55:34.791
What the Willoughby?

55:42.958 --> 55:45.666
<i>This is good, right? Exciting.</i>

55:51.041 --> 55:53.125
- Oat time.

55:55.750 --> 55:59.041
Hmph. Not hungry.

56:01.125 --> 56:04.000
Oh, I think you are, Skinny Bones.

56:04.083 --> 56:05.750
Huh? What--

56:05.833 --> 56:08.458
Hungry for freedom.

56:09.041 --> 56:09.916
Nanny?

56:10.000 --> 56:11.291
Call me Phil.

56:11.375 --> 56:13.125
- Get in the oat cart.

56:13.208 --> 56:14.125
I'm busting you out.

56:14.208 --> 56:18.208
I do not deserve
this busting you speak of.

56:19.708 --> 56:23.750
Leave me, Phil, to my short-panted guilt.

56:26.333 --> 56:31.083
Oh, pity party, huh?
Guess I didn't get my invitation.

56:33.666 --> 56:35.166
Sure, you screwed up.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I screwed up, too.

56:39.083 --> 56:42.416
I left you kids there alone. I ran away.

56:43.875 --> 56:45.791
But I came back,

56:45.875 --> 56:48.791
and I'm not leaving here
without a Willoughby.

56:49.791 --> 56:52.041
I'm just a Will-not-be.

56:54.083 --> 56:58.666
All I wanted was to be
a great Willoughby with a great family.

56:59.416 --> 57:00.625
-Hey!

57:00.708 --> 57:02.833
-Are you saying Jane's not great?
-No!

57:02.916 --> 57:04.708
-Barnaby A's not great?
-No.

57:04.791 --> 57:06.125
-Barnaby B's not great?
-Ow!

57:06.208 --> 57:09.416
-You're not great?
-Okay, okay, I get it! Stop!

57:09.500 --> 57:13.375
Look, Skinny Bones,
you have a family.

57:14.666 --> 57:18.125
They need you and you need them.

57:20.916 --> 57:22.416
My head protector.

57:24.000 --> 57:28.041
Let's blow this pop stand
and do something great, bro-bro.

57:30.375 --> 57:33.083
Let us get blowing, brother-brother.

57:39.250 --> 57:41.958
I admire your ruthlessness,
but this is crazy.

57:42.041 --> 57:43.583
Shh. Almost there.

57:44.750 --> 57:48.833
I mean, uh, uh...

57:48.916 --> 57:51.666
Just taking the oats
for a walk.

57:51.750 --> 57:55.291
Oats love walking. Come on, oats.

57:56.083 --> 57:59.833
-Is there an orphan in that cart?
-Uh...

58:00.458 --> 58:01.791
Phil?

58:01.875 --> 58:05.250
Oh, boy, orphan in an oat cart?
I've never heard of such a thing.

58:05.333 --> 58:07.291
That's preposterous.

58:07.916 --> 58:09.375
Uh, don't touch that.

58:09.458 --> 58:10.958
Don't look in there.

58:11.041 --> 58:13.125
Oh, my! My back!

58:13.208 --> 58:14.833
How dare you?

58:14.916 --> 58:17.791
You think oats grows in fields, Phil?

58:18.375 --> 58:21.041
Do you know how long
we have to soak these oats

58:21.125 --> 58:23.666
so they're soft enough
we won't choke a child?

58:23.750 --> 58:25.833
Code Blue! She's not a real Phil!

58:25.916 --> 58:27.500
- It's Linda!

58:27.583 --> 58:30.000
-Stop right there, fake Phil.
-Nanny!

58:30.083 --> 58:31.041
-Tim?
-Ow!

58:32.625 --> 58:33.833
She's stealing an orphan.

58:33.916 --> 58:35.458
He's not an orphan.

58:35.541 --> 58:37.708
And she's not a Linda.

58:37.791 --> 58:39.291
-I'm Phil.
-Phil this!

58:39.375 --> 58:40.875
Ow!

58:40.958 --> 58:43.375
-Whoo-hoo!

58:43.458 --> 58:44.416
Gotcha.

58:44.500 --> 58:47.416
-She's getting away. Stop that Linda!

58:49.583 --> 58:50.916
I knew Phil had a sweet car!

58:56.291 --> 58:58.333
Nanny, the gate!

58:58.416 --> 59:00.583
Gate, schmate. Phil ain't no sheep.

59:07.666 --> 59:10.041
<i>We have stories</i>
<i>of people in very different contexts...</i>

59:10.125 --> 59:13.291
You know,
it is nice to see Linda taking initiative.

59:13.375 --> 59:14.375
Hmm.

59:27.166 --> 59:28.833
<i>Tonight, a skinny-boned boy</i>

59:28.916 --> 59:31.500
<i>escapes a juvenile detention center.</i>
<i>The hunt for his--</i>

59:34.333 --> 59:35.875
Tim was in a box.

59:35.958 --> 59:36.958
- Barnabys.

59:37.041 --> 59:38.250
I need your help.

59:38.333 --> 59:39.875
-Okay, Tim.
-Sure, Tim.

59:39.958 --> 59:41.166
Let's go!

59:45.166 --> 59:46.291
-Nope.
- No?

59:46.375 --> 59:48.416
What do you mean, no? We have to hurry.

59:48.500 --> 59:51.541
No need to hurry. We got the drums, baby.
We got the drums.

59:52.458 --> 59:53.500
Jane, please.

59:53.583 --> 59:55.875
We're not the Willoughbys
without your what-ifs.

59:56.458 --> 59:57.291
Hmph!

59:59.000 --> 1:00:05.208
What if... I say I am sorry?

1:00:07.125 --> 1:00:08.750
What if you did?

1:00:08.833 --> 1:00:10.333
What if you accept my apology?

1:00:10.416 --> 1:00:13.166
What if you stop telling me what to do?

1:00:13.750 --> 1:00:16.041
What if you stop getting me into trouble

1:00:16.125 --> 1:00:19.625
and stuck in a coal bin while you get
to play with orphans and eat meatloaf?

1:00:21.375 --> 1:00:22.416
I accept your apology.

1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:23.500
-What?
-Yay!

1:00:23.583 --> 1:00:25.208
<i> ♪ Tim says he's sorry ♪</i>

1:00:25.291 --> 1:00:27.791
<i>♪ 'Cause he was wrong</i>
<i>About all the things I'll list-- ♪ </i>

1:00:29.041 --> 1:00:29.958
DOS. Open the door.

1:00:30.041 --> 1:00:31.958
-We gotta go.

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.750
-Can I help ya?
-We're looking for missing children.

1:00:35.833 --> 1:00:38.208
Oh, they've been found, mister.

1:00:39.875 --> 1:00:40.958
Bye!

1:00:43.666 --> 1:00:47.791
As long as they think you guys
are orphans, they will never give up.

1:00:47.875 --> 1:00:51.208
There's only one way out of this.

1:00:51.291 --> 1:00:56.916
You're not going to like it,
but what if we get our parents back?

1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:58.208
- What?
-Parents?

1:01:01.041 --> 1:01:02.333
Nanny, hands on the wheel, please.

1:01:02.416 --> 1:01:04.833
Sorry. Sorry.
But you guys have bad parents.

1:01:04.916 --> 1:01:09.250
Yes, I know they're despicable,
but they're the only ones we've got.

1:01:09.333 --> 1:01:14.208
Look, the Orphan Service lady said
that if our biological parents return,

1:01:14.291 --> 1:01:16.083
we can stay together.

1:01:16.833 --> 1:01:18.958
We have to get them back.

1:01:19.708 --> 1:01:22.083
Well, we do know where they're heading.

1:01:22.958 --> 1:01:24.333
Sveetzerlünd.

1:01:24.416 --> 1:01:25.750
He who goes up...

1:01:25.833 --> 1:01:28.083
Does not come down.

1:01:35.458 --> 1:01:37.083
-Careful.
-Huzzah!

1:01:38.083 --> 1:01:40.541
Aren't these pointy hats
splendid, snugglebug?

1:01:40.625 --> 1:01:45.416
Those pitons add such brawn
to your manly feet.

1:01:47.125 --> 1:01:48.416
To adventure!

1:01:50.916 --> 1:01:53.041
<i>How could such clever kids</i>
<i>come from these two?</i>

1:01:53.125 --> 1:01:55.583
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>this is Darwinism at work, isn't it?</i>

1:02:05.583 --> 1:02:08.500
<i>Ugh. Do we really have to save them?</i>

1:02:10.875 --> 1:02:14.458
- Willoughbys?

1:02:14.541 --> 1:02:19.333
I love your factory. I need your factory.
Give me your factory.

1:02:19.875 --> 1:02:21.750
Tonight.

1:02:22.416 --> 1:02:23.625
Hiya, Mel.

1:02:23.708 --> 1:02:26.333
We have to build something
to get us to Sveetzerlünd.

1:02:27.958 --> 1:02:28.791
Okay.

1:02:38.791 --> 1:02:40.666
-Plan A.
-Plan B.

1:02:40.750 --> 1:02:41.583
Do it.

1:02:49.333 --> 1:02:51.500
Whoo-hoo! Yay!

1:03:16.208 --> 1:03:17.041
Mmm.

1:03:23.375 --> 1:03:26.250
Whoo!

1:03:46.333 --> 1:03:48.333
That's what I call a dirigible.

1:03:48.416 --> 1:03:51.000
-Nice work, Barnabys.
-Good dirigible.

1:03:51.083 --> 1:03:52.208
Delicious dirigible.

1:03:52.291 --> 1:03:54.375
To Sveetzerlünd.

1:03:54.458 --> 1:03:57.375
Easy, Ruthie.

1:03:57.458 --> 1:04:00.416
All right, you kids go pee.
I'll be right back with the oats.

1:04:00.500 --> 1:04:02.583
- Yes. Oats.
- Whoo!

1:04:02.666 --> 1:04:06.708
Look at this.
Ruthie wants to help.

1:04:08.583 --> 1:04:10.458
It's almost like...

1:04:10.541 --> 1:04:12.166
They're a family.

1:04:14.291 --> 1:04:16.750
<i>Starting route</i>
<i>to Sveetzerlünd.</i>

1:04:20.375 --> 1:04:23.583
Ah, Sveetzerlünd.
You're gonna love it there, Ruthie.

1:04:23.666 --> 1:04:27.250
The land of chocolate, cheese and knives.

1:04:27.333 --> 1:04:29.208
-Whoa!

1:04:29.291 --> 1:04:32.458
What? Tim!

1:04:45.833 --> 1:04:49.000
Do you think Nanny will be mad we
snuck out and ran off with the dirigible

1:04:49.083 --> 1:04:49.916
and stole her phone?

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.291
- And her purse.
-She is definitely mad.

1:04:52.375 --> 1:04:56.125
But we orphaned ourselves.
We will unorphan ourselves.

1:04:59.625 --> 1:05:04.083
I'm alive! I'm finally alive!

1:05:04.166 --> 1:05:05.583
Check it out.

1:05:05.666 --> 1:05:07.166
Whoa.

1:05:08.375 --> 1:05:11.625
As these Willoughbys flew east
towards the sunrise,

1:05:11.708 --> 1:05:14.833
I'm just along for the ride, in this cone.

1:05:14.916 --> 1:05:16.750
I told you this story would be exciting.

1:05:16.833 --> 1:05:20.708
Will they reach their parents
in time? Dunno. I'm in a cone!

1:05:25.041 --> 1:05:28.791
A-ha. Unclimbable Alp, they say.

1:05:28.875 --> 1:05:33.166
Doesn't compare to the mounds of love
we've climbed, sweet Mother.

1:05:33.250 --> 1:05:36.875
-Oh, Father, take me to the tippy top.

1:05:36.958 --> 1:05:40.541
What are you doing, you idiots?

1:05:40.625 --> 1:05:43.416
Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother.
Mother, dear!

1:05:46.333 --> 1:05:48.166
-Ooh.

1:05:50.166 --> 1:05:52.000
-Oh, look, snow.
-Ooh.

1:05:54.583 --> 1:05:56.041
Fill her up, buddy.

1:05:56.916 --> 1:05:58.666
-Sugar in the drain pipe.
-Sugar in the gas tank.

1:05:58.750 --> 1:06:01.708
Good morning, we're going to stop
our parents from killing themselves.

1:06:02.333 --> 1:06:03.166
Bye!

1:06:11.625 --> 1:06:14.416
Yeah! Nice!

1:06:16.416 --> 1:06:17.750
Keep up, honey, keep up!

1:06:19.166 --> 1:06:21.166
-So much better than walking.

1:06:32.875 --> 1:06:35.166
Barnaby, Barnaby, Barnaby...

1:07:04.083 --> 1:07:05.291
Huh?

1:07:23.375 --> 1:07:26.208
I don't believe I can...

1:07:26.291 --> 1:07:29.458
feel my nose.

1:07:29.541 --> 1:07:30.500
No.

1:07:30.583 --> 1:07:32.625
We're out of yarn.

1:07:34.333 --> 1:07:37.000
I can't knit!

1:07:37.083 --> 1:07:38.083
Oh, Mother, sweets.

1:07:38.166 --> 1:07:42.291
Father, we've made a horrible mistake.

1:07:47.625 --> 1:07:52.375
We must go back home.

1:07:52.458 --> 1:07:56.750
Oh, Mother,
you are my home.

1:07:57.541 --> 1:07:58.541
Oh.

1:08:08.291 --> 1:08:10.333
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your destination.</i>

1:08:14.500 --> 1:08:15.583
There it is.

1:08:24.333 --> 1:08:25.500
Whoa.

1:08:26.916 --> 1:08:28.541
They could be anywhere up--

1:08:28.625 --> 1:08:29.750
There. Look.

1:08:30.916 --> 1:08:33.833
I suspect our parents
had something to do with that.

1:08:33.916 --> 1:08:35.333
They do make a mess of things.

1:08:35.416 --> 1:08:37.875
-Something outside.
-Definitely something outside.

1:08:45.458 --> 1:08:46.875
Looky, looky.

1:08:48.333 --> 1:08:54.625
Willoughby red. Human fibers.
Silky smooth. Father's tardigrades.

1:08:54.708 --> 1:08:56.166
I can't knit.

1:08:56.250 --> 1:08:57.833
Mother's yarn!

1:08:59.541 --> 1:09:01.833
-Yes!
-We got 'em now.

1:09:10.166 --> 1:09:11.541
Follow that yarn!

1:09:12.541 --> 1:09:14.250
Hang on, Willoughbys!

1:09:15.416 --> 1:09:16.916
I can't see a thing.

1:09:19.916 --> 1:09:21.666
No visibility.

1:09:22.791 --> 1:09:24.000
Ice to see you.

1:09:24.083 --> 1:09:26.583
Great pun, Jane.

1:09:27.791 --> 1:09:29.541
Oh, no! We're losing power!

1:09:34.416 --> 1:09:35.750
Barnabys, what's going on?

1:09:35.833 --> 1:09:38.208
-Altitude. Keep driving.
-We need more rainbow.

1:09:45.083 --> 1:09:47.000
Faster, guys!

1:09:47.083 --> 1:09:51.208
Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow.

1:09:53.416 --> 1:09:55.583
A-ha! Punch it.

1:09:55.666 --> 1:09:59.291
Rainbow. Rainbow. Rainbow!

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:09.458
Whoo!

1:10:09.541 --> 1:10:12.916
Unclimbable, but not unflyable.

1:10:18.208 --> 1:10:22.291
Look! The yarn leads right to...

1:10:24.708 --> 1:10:25.916
Oh, no!

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.750
'Tis like a yard of graves.

1:10:35.583 --> 1:10:37.416
Hurry!

1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:45.083
They have to be here!

1:10:46.583 --> 1:10:48.583
-Split up!
- Splitting!

1:10:49.291 --> 1:10:53.791
Tree. Tree.

1:10:53.875 --> 1:10:55.875
-Tree here, too.
-Another tree.

1:10:56.625 --> 1:10:57.666
No sign of them.

1:11:03.666 --> 1:11:06.750
This is impossible!

1:11:07.458 --> 1:11:10.166
We're all going to freeze out here
if we don't find them.

1:11:12.791 --> 1:11:14.041
I hear something.

1:11:14.125 --> 1:11:15.458
Me, too. Definitely hear something.

1:11:15.541 --> 1:11:17.000
Is it a some or a thing?

1:11:21.458 --> 1:11:24.583
It is some and a thing. Go!

1:11:30.791 --> 1:11:32.791
- Not a tree!
-It's parents!

1:11:32.875 --> 1:11:35.166
Their kiss, it's still warm.

1:11:35.250 --> 1:11:38.000
Heaters. Fire.

1:11:58.000 --> 1:11:59.500
Come on. Come on.

1:12:02.958 --> 1:12:06.083
- We have parents.

1:12:06.166 --> 1:12:07.625
-A mommy.
-And a daddy.

1:12:07.708 --> 1:12:12.208
Children?
Ah, Fatherkins, are we back home?

1:12:12.291 --> 1:12:16.708
No, dearest. On an alp.

1:12:16.791 --> 1:12:19.000
We have come to your rescue.

1:12:19.083 --> 1:12:21.083
Rescue? Us?

1:12:21.166 --> 1:12:22.375
But how?

1:12:22.458 --> 1:12:25.166
-We knew where you were going.
-We sent you away.

1:12:25.250 --> 1:12:26.791
The Reprehensible Travel Agency.

1:12:26.875 --> 1:12:27.875
The brochure?

1:12:27.958 --> 1:12:33.416
Mother's balls! This was... you?

1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:37.291
We wanted, um, to orphan ourselves.

1:12:37.375 --> 1:12:39.625
-But we were wrong.
-Very wrong.

1:12:39.708 --> 1:12:41.125
Oh, my.

1:12:41.625 --> 1:12:44.625
Look, we are not a perfect family.

1:12:44.708 --> 1:12:46.583
We're not even a good family.

1:12:46.666 --> 1:12:49.291
But you need us to get down this alp,

1:12:49.375 --> 1:12:52.958
and once we're down there, we need you
so that we can all stay together.

1:12:55.166 --> 1:13:01.166
You don't have to love us,
but will thou be our parents again?

1:13:02.833 --> 1:13:04.166
Please.

1:13:05.166 --> 1:13:11.083
Oh, Father, maybe we were wrong.
We can do better.

1:13:11.166 --> 1:13:13.958
Shall we? For love.

1:13:14.041 --> 1:13:14.875
For love.

1:13:27.750 --> 1:13:29.583
-Get out of my way!
-Ugh.

1:13:29.666 --> 1:13:31.750
Would you look at that machine?

1:13:31.833 --> 1:13:34.375
Oh, I do love to fly.

1:13:34.458 --> 1:13:36.666
Run, Mother. Run as fast as you can.

1:13:36.750 --> 1:13:38.250
<i> I did not see that one coming.</i>

1:13:38.333 --> 1:13:40.583
- I didn't bring my running dress.
- Lift those limbs.

1:13:40.666 --> 1:13:43.791
Here I come, Father!
To adventure!

1:13:54.125 --> 1:13:57.041
Mother, where did you learn to drive?

1:13:57.125 --> 1:13:58.916
I thought you were driving, darling.

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.000
<i>Unfortunately, the Willoughby</i>
<i>parents remained thoroughly...</i>

1:14:02.083 --> 1:14:04.583
-What do these pedals do?
-Oh.

1:14:04.666 --> 1:14:08.916
<i>...incredibly</i>
<i>and utterly selfish.</i>

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:09.916
Oh, dear.

1:14:28.708 --> 1:14:31.250
- Huh.

1:14:33.458 --> 1:14:35.041
Any chance they survived that?

1:14:36.166 --> 1:14:38.416
I don't think so.

1:14:43.208 --> 1:14:47.791
<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>All the determination, imagination.</i>

1:14:48.333 --> 1:14:53.208
<i>Doesn't matter how good you are, does it?</i>
<i>The world can be a pretty cold place.</i>

1:14:54.375 --> 1:14:56.541
We have to stay warm.

1:14:56.625 --> 1:14:57.625
Oh, Tim.

1:15:00.333 --> 1:15:01.750
It's frozen.

1:15:01.833 --> 1:15:03.208
Definitely frozen.

1:15:03.291 --> 1:15:04.750
- Hot!
- Get the hot.

1:15:04.833 --> 1:15:06.625
No! Barnabys! No! Stay together!

1:15:07.208 --> 1:15:09.541
-Oh, the hot is gone.

1:15:09.625 --> 1:15:11.666
Tim, what do we do now?

1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:16.708
The yarn!

1:15:16.791 --> 1:15:20.000
We followed it up.
We can follow it back down.

1:15:20.083 --> 1:15:24.041
-Tim! Come back! Please! We have to...

1:15:31.291 --> 1:15:33.125
No!

1:15:36.958 --> 1:15:38.791
It's hopeless.

1:15:38.875 --> 1:15:40.375
Come back.

1:15:42.375 --> 1:15:44.416
-Cold.

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:47.625
-Sweater.

1:15:48.291 --> 1:15:49.916
No.

1:15:53.541 --> 1:15:58.333
One last what-if.

1:16:11.125 --> 1:16:12.791
-I heard something.
-Me, too.

1:17:53.625 --> 1:17:56.916
Thank you, Jane.

1:18:06.916 --> 1:18:08.375
Thank you.

1:18:20.166 --> 1:18:23.000
Tragic.

1:18:24.375 --> 1:18:27.958
But remember,
this is an old-fashioned story,

1:18:28.041 --> 1:18:31.833
and as such,
it can't end like this, can it?

1:18:31.916 --> 1:18:34.083
Whee!

1:18:45.125 --> 1:18:47.166
- Ruth?

1:18:47.250 --> 1:18:49.041
It's a Swiss gyrocopter.

1:18:49.125 --> 1:18:50.375
Whoo! There's a can opener!

1:18:50.458 --> 1:18:52.166
That's a corkscrew.

1:18:52.250 --> 1:18:53.708
Lickety twist!

1:18:53.791 --> 1:18:57.000
-Oh, Skinny Bones.
-Nanny?

1:18:57.083 --> 1:18:59.500
After all we've been through,
you abandon us? Oh!

1:18:59.583 --> 1:19:01.708
But how did you find us?

1:19:01.791 --> 1:19:03.708
We followed the rainbow into the storm.

1:19:03.791 --> 1:19:05.791
Then Ruth heard your jolly jingle.

1:19:08.333 --> 1:19:11.041
You heard my song? Wow.

1:19:11.125 --> 1:19:13.625
It was beautiful, Jane.

1:19:14.333 --> 1:19:16.708
I'm sure your folks loved it.

1:19:16.791 --> 1:19:18.416
Speaking of folks, where are they?

1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:20.583
I want to tell them
how great their kids are.

1:19:20.666 --> 1:19:22.708
They stole our dandy dirigible.

1:19:22.791 --> 1:19:24.416
We have really bad parents.

1:19:24.500 --> 1:19:25.958
You mean had.

1:19:26.041 --> 1:19:28.583
We're orphans. For real.

1:19:28.666 --> 1:19:30.500
-What?
-Oh.

1:19:30.583 --> 1:19:31.625
No parents.

1:19:31.708 --> 1:19:34.416
-No home.
-No place to go.

1:19:34.500 --> 1:19:35.916
We've lost it all.

1:19:37.125 --> 1:19:38.958
But we have each other.

1:19:39.916 --> 1:19:45.708
Look, we sailed a candy dirigible
over an ocean,

1:19:46.291 --> 1:19:48.250
climbed the unclimbable.

1:19:48.333 --> 1:19:50.958
-We didn't actually climb.
-I know, but it's a nice speech.

1:19:51.041 --> 1:19:55.041
So as long as we stick together,
we'll be okay.

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:57.500
With or without parents.

1:20:05.833 --> 1:20:07.291
What if--

1:20:07.375 --> 1:20:09.458
We became a family?

1:20:10.208 --> 1:20:11.666
Hi, Mommy.

1:20:13.416 --> 1:20:16.500
I'm all in!

1:20:16.583 --> 1:20:19.875
-Diddly-dee! Same with me!

1:20:19.958 --> 1:20:24.166
Commander, get us out of here.
It's too cold to be mushy.

1:20:24.250 --> 1:20:25.708
Grandy dandy!

1:20:28.458 --> 1:20:31.250
Why aren't we using the helicopter?

1:20:31.333 --> 1:20:34.791
We don't need no helicopters.
We're family.

1:20:39.083 --> 1:20:40.875
Okay, it's a bit weird,
all right?

1:20:40.958 --> 1:20:43.083
But we got there in the end.

1:20:43.166 --> 1:20:46.000
Determination, imagination, hope.

1:20:46.083 --> 1:20:48.625
Told you I know a good story
when I see one.

1:20:48.708 --> 1:20:51.291
The best stories
are the hard ones, y'know?

1:20:55.875 --> 1:20:58.625
Hmm! It's not bushy.

1:20:58.708 --> 1:21:00.916
Still, it is a mustache.

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.375
I think we know
what that means, right, Tim?

1:21:02.458 --> 1:21:05.291
We're not doing
the great thing anymore,

1:21:05.375 --> 1:21:06.916
since that happened.

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:08.708
Mustache.

1:21:10.083 --> 1:21:11.583
Well, if you ate your oats, Tim...

1:21:11.666 --> 1:21:13.750
you'd have hair everywhere.

1:21:13.833 --> 1:21:16.375
Maybe hairless Tim wants something new.

1:21:16.958 --> 1:21:19.291
I call it Melanoff meatloaf!

1:21:19.375 --> 1:21:20.500
Ooh.

1:21:21.666 --> 1:21:22.708
-Ruth.
- Oh, no, no.

1:21:22.791 --> 1:21:25.333
- Ugh. Oh.
- Ugh!

1:21:25.416 --> 1:21:28.750
Look, Tim.
Ruth has a meat mustache.

1:21:29.791 --> 1:21:30.916
Willoughby.

1:21:33.416 --> 1:21:37.333
Look at them,
a perfectly imperfect family.

1:21:37.416 --> 1:21:40.291
And while they didn't get
everything they wanted...

1:21:40.375 --> 1:21:41.500
Here we go!

1:21:41.583 --> 1:21:43.333
<i> ...they got what they needed.</i>

1:21:43.416 --> 1:21:46.375
<i>I guess we all need love. Even me.</i>

1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:49.666
I love my mustache!

1:21:49.750 --> 1:21:52.958
See?
They all lived happily ever after.

1:21:53.791 --> 1:21:57.333
Which is more than I can say for...
you know.

1:22:07.541 --> 1:22:12.791
Oh, mushy buns,
I do love seeing the world with you.

1:22:12.875 --> 1:22:14.583
Even the wet bits.

1:22:15.916 --> 1:22:19.666
Nothing will stop us
from adventuring, Mother.
