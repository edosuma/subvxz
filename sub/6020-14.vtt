WEBVTT

00:04.455 --> 00:07.115
- Who is the last president to have a beard?
- Nixon.

00:07.191 --> 00:10.124
- No, I mean a real thick beard.
- His was thick.

00:10.194 --> 00:13.559
No, I mean like a full, long beard,
like Smith Brothers Cough Drops.

00:13.631 --> 00:14.720
Falkmore.

00:14.799 --> 00:17.732
- Who?
- Artemis N. Falkmore.

00:17.802 --> 00:19.529
- You made that up, right?
- Yeah.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.637
- But it sounds like a president name?
- Yeah.

00:21.706 --> 00:23.467
Why do presidents all
have bad names?

00:23.541 --> 00:25.074
Woodrow, Grover, Millard.

00:25.142 --> 00:27.335
The presidency attracts
the badly named.

00:27.411 --> 00:29.570
Their ambition is based on
personal insecurity.

00:29.647 --> 00:31.442
It's classic male overcompensation.

00:31.515 --> 00:34.413
Are you wearing lifts
in those shoes?

00:35.319 --> 00:37.046
Cab.

00:42.059 --> 00:44.753
So they have this clock now,
where you punch in your age...

00:44.829 --> 00:46.760
and all your risk factors...

00:46.831 --> 00:50.094
and it actually counts down
how much time you have left to live.

00:50.167 --> 00:52.201
What's the great moment?
On your deathbed.

00:52.269 --> 00:55.998
They're pounding on your chest,
and you're going: "Ten, nine, eight...

00:56.073 --> 00:58.107
I told you this thing was good."

00:59.043 --> 01:02.010
- I can't believe this is our first date.
- I know. Dessert?

01:02.079 --> 01:04.510
I suppose I have to get
a piece of cake.

01:04.581 --> 01:07.776
- Why?
- Today is my birthday.

01:07.852 --> 01:09.817
What? Today?

01:09.887 --> 01:11.147
- Really?
- Yep.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.833 --> 01:26.460
So she went out with you
on a first date and it was her birthday?

01:26.537 --> 01:28.969
Yeah, and she picked the day.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.664
Is she socially...

01:30.741 --> 01:32.240
awkward?

01:32.309 --> 01:33.637
No, she's great.

01:33.711 --> 01:36.871
- She's attractive and fun.
- Well, maybe she decided...

01:36.947 --> 01:39.743
to celebrate her birthday on
the Monday after the weekend.

01:39.817 --> 01:42.351
She's not Lincoln.

01:42.987 --> 01:44.452
Hey.

01:44.955 --> 01:46.682
Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?

01:46.757 --> 01:48.825
- I'll pass.
- Oh, really?

01:48.893 --> 01:51.962
Hey, George. Pizza.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.290
I can't. I gotta go down
to the foundation.

01:54.365 --> 01:58.424
I'm interviewing high schoolers
for the Susan Ross Scholarship.

01:58.936 --> 02:01.266
Does it ever bother you
that this organization...

02:01.338 --> 02:02.996
- Nope.
- is beating the bushes...

02:03.074 --> 02:06.234
- No.
- to basically give this money away...

02:06.310 --> 02:08.104
- No.
- to virtually anyone...

02:08.179 --> 02:10.076
as long as they're not you?

02:10.146 --> 02:11.612
I'm fine with it.

02:11.682 --> 02:13.682
Fine, I say.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.517
And then I received a 740
on the English Achievement Test.

02:20.591 --> 02:22.750
Quick, what's your favorite animal?

02:23.761 --> 02:26.796
I don't know. Frog?

02:27.598 --> 02:28.926
Frog?

02:29.433 --> 02:32.400
- Well, I...
- Frog is wrong.

02:34.038 --> 02:36.299
I see here that you play the harp.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.737
Tell me, why do they have to tilt it?

02:41.145 --> 02:43.179
Can't they just build it on an angle?

02:43.247 --> 02:44.974
Save you a lot of trouble.

02:45.049 --> 02:48.277
Well, the modern-day harp has been
refined over thousands of years...

02:48.352 --> 02:51.683
- back to...
- Yeah, yeah, we'll let you know.

02:53.324 --> 02:57.053
I see your GPA is 4.0.

02:57.128 --> 02:58.889
You like that, don't you?

03:01.432 --> 03:05.730
So, Steven, I see you're
president of the chess club.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.164
State champs.

03:08.706 --> 03:10.569
Who's your favorite chess player?

03:12.877 --> 03:14.808
Nastercoff?

03:18.916 --> 03:20.506
Right.

03:20.584 --> 03:22.413
Nastercoff.

03:25.222 --> 03:26.949
What country is he from again?

03:28.092 --> 03:30.126
I don't know.

03:31.095 --> 03:32.958
I made it up.

03:33.330 --> 03:34.954
I'm never gonna get this thing.

03:36.367 --> 03:37.900
What are you telling me for?

03:37.968 --> 03:40.298
You really had me going there.

03:40.371 --> 03:42.769
Come on, sit down.

03:45.176 --> 03:47.005
What do you want to do
when you grow up?

03:47.511 --> 03:51.445
Well, I've been telling people
that I'd like to be an architect.

03:56.754 --> 04:00.449
So get this, Mr. Peterman is finally
letting me do some real writing.

04:00.524 --> 04:02.854
He's got this book deal
for his autobiography.

04:02.927 --> 04:04.654
He's gonna let me ghostwrite it.

04:04.728 --> 04:06.523
Wow, that's great.
When it comes out...

04:06.597 --> 04:09.188
I'll have to get someone
to ghost-read it.

04:09.266 --> 04:10.594
- Hey. Oh, hi.
- Hey.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.633
- Hey.
- So there I am at Lorenzo's...

04:12.703 --> 04:16.329
Ioading up my slice
at the fixings bar.

04:16.406 --> 04:19.305
Garlic and whatnot.

04:19.944 --> 04:22.035
When I see this guy over at
the pizza boxes...

04:22.112 --> 04:24.578
giving me the stink eye.

04:26.517 --> 04:29.780
So I give him the crook eye back,
you know?

04:31.822 --> 04:33.753
And I notice that he's not alone.

04:33.824 --> 04:36.984
I'm taking on
the entire Van Buren Boys.

04:37.061 --> 04:38.458
- Van Buren Boys?
- Yeah.

04:38.529 --> 04:41.496
There's a street gang named after
President Martin Van Buren?

04:41.565 --> 04:44.463
Oh, yeah, and they're
just as mean as he was.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.830
So I make a move to
the door, you know?

04:46.904 --> 04:48.232
They block it.

04:48.305 --> 04:51.636
So I lunge for the bathroom.
I grab the knob.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.470
Occupied.

04:55.379 --> 04:59.415
Then they back me up
against the cartoon map of Italy...

04:59.483 --> 05:02.609
and all of a sudden they just stop.

05:02.686 --> 05:04.219
What? What happened?

05:04.288 --> 05:07.880
Because I'm still holding
the garlic shaker, like this:

05:07.958 --> 05:09.582
I'm only showing eight fingers.

05:09.660 --> 05:13.161
- Well, what does that mean?
- That's their secret sign.

05:14.632 --> 05:18.293
See, Van Buren, he was
the eighth president.

05:18.369 --> 05:20.437
They thought I was
a former Van B Boy.

05:22.506 --> 05:25.871
- How was the pizza?
- It was a little oily.

05:27.711 --> 05:30.609
Jerry, can you hold on a sec?
I just wanna check my messages.

05:33.217 --> 05:34.545
Oh, Melissa, Kim.

05:35.052 --> 05:37.620
- Ellen.
- Hey. I want you to meet Jerry.

05:37.921 --> 05:41.047
Oh, we've heard a lot about you.

05:42.026 --> 05:44.788
It is so sweet of you to take her out.

05:44.862 --> 05:47.157
Yeah, you don't even know
how much she needs this.

05:47.231 --> 05:48.923
Is she coming off a bad breakup?

05:48.999 --> 05:50.327
No.

05:50.401 --> 05:52.025
See you.

05:55.072 --> 05:58.335
- Get your messages?
- Yeah. No one called.

06:01.178 --> 06:03.974
They acted like it was some
act of charity, going out with her.

06:04.048 --> 06:06.082
So she's the loser of the group.

06:06.150 --> 06:09.515
Every group has someone
that they all make fun of.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.950
Like us with Elaine.

06:16.894 --> 06:19.485
There's no way Ellen
is the loser of that group.

06:19.563 --> 06:22.496
Are you looking deep down
at the real person underneath?

06:22.566 --> 06:25.760
No, I'm being as superficial
as I possibly can.

06:26.466 --> 06:28.892
- Well, stick with it.
- Yeah.

06:28.893 --> 06:31.872
- I think I may have found someone for the scholarship.
- Yeah?

06:31.942 --> 06:35.341
I'm interviewing all these
annoying little overachievers...

06:35.412 --> 06:39.039
and finally this kid walks in,
Steven Koren, a regular guy.

06:39.116 --> 06:41.275
Likes sports, watches TV.

06:41.352 --> 06:44.888
- Is he smart?
- He knows how to read.

06:45.856 --> 06:50.290
And he also knows that finishing
an entire book doesn't prove anything.

06:50.361 --> 06:51.792
But get this:

06:51.862 --> 06:53.452
He's into architecture.

06:53.530 --> 06:56.190
Hey, just like you pretend to be.

06:58.035 --> 07:00.626
Yes, with a little guidance...

07:00.704 --> 07:04.171
Steven Koren is going to be
everything I claim to be, only for real.

07:05.776 --> 07:07.343
That's my dream, Jerry.

07:07.411 --> 07:11.971
I had a dream last night
that a hamburger was eating me.

07:18.622 --> 07:21.885
Mr. Peterman, thanks
for having me over. I...

07:22.393 --> 07:24.688
Your place isn't quite
what I imagined.

07:24.762 --> 07:28.161
Oh, it's just a place to flop.

07:29.233 --> 07:32.996
Well, what part of your life
do you want to start with?

07:33.070 --> 07:35.832
Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?

07:35.906 --> 07:39.066
Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that
in the catalog, ad nauseam.

07:39.143 --> 07:42.508
No, I would like this book
to be about my day-to-day life.

07:44.181 --> 07:46.647
Oh, damn, they changed
the cable stations again...

07:46.717 --> 07:49.411
just when I finally
memorized them.

07:50.287 --> 07:52.719
- Well, Mr. Peterman, do you want to...?
- Two: CBS.

07:52.790 --> 07:55.358
- Get started?
- Three....

07:55.426 --> 07:57.892
I don't know what that is.

07:58.662 --> 08:01.230
Where's my damn preview channel?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.660
Well, I gotta tell you, Mr. Peterman...

08:05.736 --> 08:08.566
I don't know if I see
a whole book here.

08:09.106 --> 08:11.697
Well, I'm sure we'll
come up with something.

08:11.775 --> 08:14.605
What do you say you and l
order ourselves a pie?

08:14.678 --> 08:16.245
Do you like Lorenzo's?

08:17.448 --> 08:21.780
A friend of mine almost got beat up
at that place by the Van Buren Boys.

08:21.852 --> 08:23.214
- You don't say?
- Yeah.

08:23.287 --> 08:24.911
The only thing that saved
him is...

08:24.988 --> 08:27.318
he accidentally flashed
their secret gang sign.

08:27.658 --> 08:29.419
- Well, that's pretty exciting.
- Yeah.

08:29.493 --> 08:31.652
Let's put that in the book.

08:33.630 --> 08:35.721
But that didn't happen to you.

08:35.799 --> 08:39.892
Well, so we pay off your friend,
and it becomes a Peterman.

08:41.337 --> 08:43.599
No, I really don't think
you can do that.

08:43.674 --> 08:48.677
Oh, damn, I forgot to buy
plant food again.

08:49.046 --> 08:52.206
I'll bet I got a coupon for it.

08:53.851 --> 08:56.442
You know what?
Maybe I better talk to my friend.

09:01.492 --> 09:04.186
Is that the same outfit
you were wearing yesterday?

09:04.261 --> 09:06.761
No, this is brand-new.
Do you like it?

09:06.830 --> 09:08.488
Actually, yeah.

09:11.435 --> 09:14.971
Wait a second.
Is that the fork that fell on the floor?

09:15.038 --> 09:18.596
Are you using the fork
that fell on the floor?

09:18.675 --> 09:21.300
No, Jerry, the waitress
gave me another one.

09:21.378 --> 09:23.844
I guess that's all right.

09:23.914 --> 09:28.917
- Is something wrong, Jerry?
- No, absolutely nothing.

09:29.386 --> 09:31.181
You're fantastic.

09:32.222 --> 09:33.619
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

09:33.690 --> 09:35.724
Kramer, George, this is Ellen.

09:41.365 --> 09:44.662
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am happy to introduce you...

09:44.735 --> 09:47.827
to the first Susan Ross Scholar.

09:47.905 --> 09:49.165
This...

09:49.239 --> 09:50.966
is Steven Koren.

09:52.009 --> 09:55.806
His GPA is a solid 2.0.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.609
Right in that meaty part
of the curve.

09:59.683 --> 10:02.479
Not showing off, not falling behind.

10:02.553 --> 10:04.917
George, the qualifications
for this scholarship...

10:04.988 --> 10:07.522
were supposed to be
largely academic.

10:07.624 --> 10:09.749
I'm sure we're all aware
of the flaws...

10:09.826 --> 10:12.087
and biases of standardized tests.

10:12.162 --> 10:15.356
These aren't standardized tests.
These are his grades.

10:15.432 --> 10:19.229
Besides, Steven Koren has
the highest of aspirations.

10:19.303 --> 10:21.598
He wants to be...

10:22.005 --> 10:23.766
an architect.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.168
Is that right?

10:25.242 --> 10:28.334
Actually, maybe I could set
my sights a little bit higher.

10:28.412 --> 10:32.175
Steven, nothing is higher
than architect.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.216
I think I'd really like to be
a city planner.

10:35.285 --> 10:38.548
Why limit myself to one building
when I can design a whole city?

10:38.622 --> 10:40.690
- Well, that's a good point.
- No, it's not.

10:40.757 --> 10:42.984
Isn't an architect just
an art school dropout...

10:43.060 --> 10:45.185
with a tilting desk and a big ruler?

10:45.262 --> 10:47.626
It's called a T-square.

10:47.965 --> 10:51.398
You know, the stupidest guy
in my fraternity became an architect...

10:51.468 --> 10:53.593
after he flunked
out of dental school.

10:55.372 --> 10:56.905
Congratulations, young man.

10:57.007 --> 10:59.268
Susan would be very proud
of what you're doing.

10:59.343 --> 11:00.876
Thank you.

11:02.512 --> 11:05.775
And they made it their sign because
Van Buren, our eighth president...

11:05.849 --> 11:07.883
was the man they most admired.

11:09.419 --> 11:13.478
Kramer, my friend,
that is one ripping good yarn.

11:15.726 --> 11:18.659
You know, if you liked that one,
I got more.

11:19.329 --> 11:20.657
What are you looking for?

11:20.731 --> 11:23.595
Romance? Comedy? Adventure?

11:23.667 --> 11:25.632
Erotica?

11:26.236 --> 11:27.564
No, Kramer, I don't think...

11:27.638 --> 11:30.707
How much would you take
for the whole lot?

11:32.275 --> 11:34.935
- My whole life?
- Name your price, man.

11:35.879 --> 11:37.241
$1500.

11:38.181 --> 11:40.772
- I'll give you half that.
- Done.

11:40.851 --> 11:43.511
Kramer, my friend, you consider
Elaine at your disposal.

11:44.021 --> 11:45.816
Okay.

11:45.889 --> 11:47.286
Well, I....

11:47.357 --> 11:50.017
I like to work in the evenings.

11:57.668 --> 12:01.260
Would you please just get on
with the stupid Bob Sacamano story?

12:01.338 --> 12:04.532
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob,
and I realize right then and there...

12:04.608 --> 12:08.769
that I need to return this pair
of pants. So I'm off to the store.

12:08.845 --> 12:10.537
What happened to Bob Sacamano?

12:10.681 --> 12:13.306
Well, nothing. His part
of the story is done.

12:15.686 --> 12:17.720
I'm waiting for the subway.
It's not coming.

12:17.788 --> 12:19.685
I decided to hoof it
through the tunnel.

12:19.790 --> 12:21.289
Well, now, that's something.

12:21.358 --> 12:23.551
I don't know
if I lost track of time or what.

12:23.627 --> 12:26.161
- The next thing I knew...
- A train is bearing down on you?

12:26.229 --> 12:28.661
No, I slipped and fell in mud...

12:28.732 --> 12:33.064
ruining the very pants
I was about to return.

12:34.771 --> 12:36.736
I don't understand.

12:36.807 --> 12:40.138
You were wearing the pants
you were returning?

12:40.711 --> 12:42.836
Well, I guess I was.

12:43.380 --> 12:46.313
What were you gonna
wear on the way back?

12:46.583 --> 12:48.480
Elaine, are you listening?

12:48.552 --> 12:51.018
I didn't even get there.

12:53.457 --> 12:56.424
- All right. Next story.
- I think I've got enough for one day.

12:56.493 --> 12:58.390
- Yeah, chew on that.
- I'll chew on that.

12:58.462 --> 13:01.622
Hey, listen. By the way, I'm hosting
a little get-together tonight...

13:01.698 --> 13:04.028
in honor of my little
financial upturn.

13:04.101 --> 13:06.192
Oh, thanks, I've got plans.

13:06.269 --> 13:08.735
Yeah, Elaine, you should be there
to document it.

13:08.805 --> 13:12.841
Oh, you're getting together with
some of your jackass friends?

13:12.909 --> 13:15.534
- You want me to take notes?
- Yeah, but get there after 9.

13:15.612 --> 13:18.738
You know, give the people
a chance to loosen up.

13:26.256 --> 13:29.621
So you're denying him the scholarship
because he wants to be a city planner?

13:29.726 --> 13:31.191
I was betrayed.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.690
That kid was like a son to me.

13:34.765 --> 13:37.333
If there's one person
you should be able to hold down...

13:37.400 --> 13:39.263
it's your own flesh and blood.

13:39.336 --> 13:42.633
Like my father
and my father's father before him.

13:43.106 --> 13:46.039
You know, maybe philanthropy
is not your field.

13:48.044 --> 13:50.544
Hello. Oh, hi, Ellen.
Yeah, I called the hotel.

13:50.614 --> 13:53.410
- We're set for the weekend.
- Spending the weekend with Ellen?

13:53.650 --> 13:55.547
Vermont.

13:55.719 --> 13:58.583
You know, we can stay
an extra couple of days if we want.

13:58.655 --> 14:01.485
Four days at a beautiful
bed-and-breakfast.

14:01.558 --> 14:02.989
I can't wait.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.921
Bye-bye.

14:09.733 --> 14:11.164
What?

14:11.868 --> 14:13.697
What is this?

14:16.606 --> 14:19.300
- You wanna start?
- No, no, no. You go ahead.

14:19.376 --> 14:21.603
I gotta get my thoughts together.

14:22.946 --> 14:27.506
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation
has gone far enough.

14:27.684 --> 14:29.945
- What?
- Jerry, she's a loser.

14:31.655 --> 14:34.019
Where is this coming from?
She's great.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.283
Why are you doing this, Jerry?

14:36.359 --> 14:39.587
Is it your career?
Things are gonna pick up.

14:39.930 --> 14:42.260
There's nothing wrong
with my career.

14:42.332 --> 14:45.299
I like the Bloomingdale's
executive training program for him.

14:45.368 --> 14:47.026
We weren't gonna
discuss that now.

14:47.103 --> 14:50.104
- It's something he should consider.
- Of course he should.

14:50.173 --> 14:53.333
- But now is not the time.
- Listen, these issues are interrelated.

14:53.410 --> 14:56.172
All right. Excuse me.

14:56.246 --> 14:57.938
I'm not buying any of this.

14:58.014 --> 15:01.208
So, what are you saying? That we're
wrong? Everybody's wrong but you.

15:01.451 --> 15:04.076
This is like that Twilight Zone
where the guy wakes up...

15:04.154 --> 15:06.722
and he's the same,
and everybody else is different.

15:06.890 --> 15:09.891
- Which one?
- They were all like that.

15:15.398 --> 15:17.898
Why did you take away
my scholarship, Mr. Costanza?

15:18.001 --> 15:19.659
Well, Steven, I....

15:24.140 --> 15:25.730
These are my new friends...

15:25.809 --> 15:27.274
the Van Buren Boys.

15:27.344 --> 15:30.743
He became so disillusioned,
he had to join us.

15:32.048 --> 15:33.945
- Nice.
- I want my scholarship back...

15:34.017 --> 15:35.744
so I can be a city planner.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.879
What about architect, Steven?

15:39.456 --> 15:42.081
City planner.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.231
- Great party, K-Man.
- You got that straight.

15:49.299 --> 15:54.200
Elaine, try the beef, because that's
real au jus sauce. Real au jus sauce.

15:54.271 --> 15:56.805
- I'll make a note of it.
- Hey, Kramer.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.271
- Yeah.
- Ramirez has never heard your story.

15:59.342 --> 16:00.704
Oh, okay.

16:00.777 --> 16:02.708
Well, I had Bob Sacamano
on the phone...

16:02.779 --> 16:05.575
- and I suddenly realized that I...
- Hey, Kramer, Kramer.

16:05.649 --> 16:07.546
You can't tell that story now.

16:07.617 --> 16:09.014
It belongs to Peterman.

16:09.586 --> 16:11.654
- What do you mean?
- You signed the release.

16:11.755 --> 16:14.619
- Yeah.
- He sat in mud, not you.

16:16.593 --> 16:19.127
- But I did sit in mud.
- You didn't.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.853
You never sat in mud.

16:20.931 --> 16:22.760
I was all dirty.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.800
- It never happened, you understand?
- Come on.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.967
- Hey, all right. Yeah.
- Finish the story?

16:29.039 --> 16:32.336
Oh, yeah, well, I...
Yeah, the pants... They...

16:32.409 --> 16:37.276
They... They fit well and so I decided
I wasn't gonna return them.

16:41.284 --> 16:43.375
- Getting late. We better get going.
- Okay.

16:43.453 --> 16:45.111
You're gonna go now?

16:45.956 --> 16:47.751
Hey, whoa. Come...

16:48.024 --> 16:49.455
I don't...

16:49.793 --> 16:53.727
Kramer, Kramer, I got big trouble
with the Van Buren Boys.

16:53.797 --> 16:55.956
- They're tough cookies.
- I heard that you...

16:56.032 --> 16:57.997
got on their good side.
What did you do?

16:59.636 --> 17:01.465
Oh, nothing, nothing.

17:01.538 --> 17:05.836
No, I certainly don't have any stories
if that's what you're implying.

17:06.041 --> 17:07.837
You know what those guys
are gonna do?

17:08.144 --> 17:10.234
Yeah, well, you didn't hear it
from me...

17:10.313 --> 17:14.747
but the Van Buren Boys,
they never hassle their own kind.

17:14.884 --> 17:16.451
You mean, like a former member?

17:22.625 --> 17:26.023
These Kramer stories are unusable.

17:26.229 --> 17:29.321
I mean, some of them
aren't even stories.

17:29.566 --> 17:33.033
Look, this is the list
of things in his apartment.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.103
Is my toaster oven on there?

17:38.341 --> 17:41.467
How am I ever gonna
turn this into a book?

17:41.544 --> 17:44.135
Well, just shape them, change them.
You're a writer.

17:45.215 --> 17:47.408
Yes...

17:47.484 --> 17:49.381
I'm a writer.

17:49.619 --> 17:51.209
Make them interesting.

17:51.588 --> 17:53.212
Interesting.

17:53.390 --> 17:54.957
Of course.

17:55.058 --> 17:58.457
People love interesting writing.

18:00.764 --> 18:03.628
Well, I gotta go to the airport.
I'm picking up my parents.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.199
What? Weren't they just here?

18:05.268 --> 18:07.734
Yeah, I'm flying them in
to meet Ellen.

18:07.804 --> 18:09.337
I don't know where to turn.

18:09.406 --> 18:12.566
- I gotta see what they think of her.
- Maybe we can have dinner later.

18:12.642 --> 18:16.303
I don't think so. I'm gonna try
to get them to fly right back tonight.

18:16.579 --> 18:19.409
Oh, hey. Hey, have I told you
about my bunions?

18:19.482 --> 18:21.049
You're going to love this story.

18:21.251 --> 18:23.911
So I line up my cold cuts
on the couch next to me...

18:23.987 --> 18:27.147
but as I'm stacking them up
they keep falling into my footbath.

18:27.257 --> 18:29.052
Kramer, this is awful.

18:29.125 --> 18:30.715
We don't wanna hear about this.

18:31.194 --> 18:33.728
- Damn.
- What?

18:33.897 --> 18:36.261
Oh, I bought a bunch
of bunion stories from Newman.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.297
But they all stink.

18:38.501 --> 18:41.035
- How much did you pay for them?
- Eight bucks.

18:41.104 --> 18:42.967
I think I'm getting ripped off.

18:44.407 --> 18:46.202
Newman!

18:48.545 --> 18:51.944
Well, what didn't you like
about the first chapter?

18:52.015 --> 18:54.015
Well, it started out nicely.

18:54.084 --> 18:56.846
I'm returning some pants...

18:56.920 --> 18:59.853
a very identifiable problem.

19:00.156 --> 19:02.588
I set off down a train tunnel.

19:02.659 --> 19:05.557
Now, that's where the story takes
a most unappealing turn.

19:05.628 --> 19:07.889
Oh, no, no, that's where
it gets interesting.

19:07.964 --> 19:11.090
Don't you see? The train
is bearing down on you...

19:11.167 --> 19:13.758
you dive into a side tunnel...

19:13.837 --> 19:18.271
and you run into a whole band
of underground tunnel dwellers.

19:18.608 --> 19:21.506
It just seems so clichéd
and obvious.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.475
It's not interesting writing.

19:24.681 --> 19:27.215
Yeah, yeah, I know.

19:27.517 --> 19:32.748
How about if instead
of diving from the train, you...?

19:33.223 --> 19:37.760
I don't know. You slip
and fall in some mud...

19:38.962 --> 19:41.292
and ruin your pants?

19:44.701 --> 19:47.167
The very pants I was returning.

19:50.173 --> 19:54.733
That's perfect irony.
Elaine, that is interesting writing.

19:55.245 --> 19:58.576
I have a Cosmo Kramer on line four.

19:59.482 --> 20:01.675
- Peterman here.
- Mr. Peterson...

20:01.751 --> 20:03.580
you gotta sell me
my stories back.

20:03.653 --> 20:06.916
You wanna know something?
I no longer need them.

20:06.990 --> 20:10.253
No, no, no, Mr. Peterman, why
don't we keep them as a reference.

20:10.426 --> 20:11.891
Nonsense.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.895
I have Benes' wonderfully
imaginative mind to spin my stories.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.192
You take back your tales,
you vagabond.

20:19.169 --> 20:22.170
There you are, Elaine.
Go forth and create.

20:22.772 --> 20:26.308
And by the way, when you get to that
chapter about romantic escapades...

20:26.376 --> 20:28.944
feel free to toss yourself
into the mix.

20:35.351 --> 20:36.713
Hey, Van B Boys.

20:36.886 --> 20:39.477
So, Mr. Costanza,
did you get my scholarship back?

20:39.556 --> 20:41.920
Now, fellas, fellas, easy.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.116
Wouldn't wanna beat up
on one of your own.

20:44.227 --> 20:45.760
Is that right?

20:45.828 --> 20:49.227
Then why don't you
flash us the sign?

20:50.366 --> 20:52.024
Right.

20:53.136 --> 20:54.965
The sign.

21:03.713 --> 21:05.075
That's not the sign.

21:05.415 --> 21:07.380
It was when I was banging.

21:07.951 --> 21:09.075
All right...

21:09.152 --> 21:11.117
if you are really one of us...

21:11.187 --> 21:15.087
Iet's see you take the wallet
off the next guy who walks by.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.725
Love to.

21:21.130 --> 21:24.097
And after college I got my
master's at the Sorbonne.

21:24.167 --> 21:27.998
Sorbonne.
Oh, hey, that's in Paris.

21:28.071 --> 21:30.162
Jerry, your parking meter
is about to expire.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.103
Don't get up. I've got change.

21:36.179 --> 21:39.442
- So, what do you think?
- Jerry, she is fantastic.

21:39.515 --> 21:41.776
I knew it. I'm not crazy.

21:41.851 --> 21:43.179
She's so sweet.

21:43.253 --> 21:45.184
And she's got some body on her.

21:45.255 --> 21:47.915
And smart, like a computer.

21:49.859 --> 21:53.087
And so much personality.
But it doesn't matter what we think.

21:53.162 --> 21:54.559
Do you like her?

21:56.266 --> 21:58.800
Now I'm not so sure.

21:58.935 --> 22:02.869
She's 10 times better than that
awful Amber girl that you were with.

22:02.939 --> 22:06.805
Yeah, Amber.
I wonder if she's back from Vegas.

22:10.980 --> 22:12.445
All right, no more stalling.

22:12.515 --> 22:15.140
Next one or you're meat.

22:15.218 --> 22:16.842
All right. All right.

22:19.956 --> 22:22.616
- Seinfelds.
- Hey, George.

22:22.692 --> 22:24.020
You gotta do me a favor.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.525
Give me your wallet.
I'll give it back to you later.

22:26.596 --> 22:27.924
How are your folks?

22:28.097 --> 22:30.563
Trying to pick out a new couch.
You don't wanna know.

22:30.633 --> 22:34.794
Give me your wallet or I'll spill
your guts right here on the street.

22:35.071 --> 22:36.661
What did you say?

22:36.739 --> 22:38.363
Come on, hurry up, old man.

22:38.441 --> 22:39.906
I'm an animal.

22:39.976 --> 22:42.067
You're being very rude.
Come on, Morty.

22:42.145 --> 22:44.736
- Please, they're gonna hit me.
- What?

22:44.814 --> 22:48.782
George Costanza,
what is the matter with you?

22:48.951 --> 22:51.178
Tell your parents we said hi.
