01:14.594 --> 01:17.260
All right, team, I've got
my eye on the targets.

01:17.380 --> 01:20.760
I'll cover you from up he...
Hey, Keith, I had that guy!

01:29.770 --> 01:31.190
They're still coming!

02:02.810 --> 02:04.270
Well, that was awesome!

02:13.900 --> 02:16.940
Pidge, could you maybe
hurry it up a little?

02:17.070 --> 02:19.030
Almost...

02:19.160 --> 02:20.556
There!

02:34.076 --> 02:35.262
Great job, Pidge.

02:35.268 --> 02:37.925
That's the last outpost
in this quadrant.

02:38.045 --> 02:39.545
Call the Blade of Marmora.

02:39.665 --> 02:41.640
Let them know this base is cleared.

02:49.730 --> 02:50.980
I don't know.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.700
The last thing I remember was Zarkon

02:52.820 --> 02:54.730
trying to overtake the Black Lion.

02:54.860 --> 02:56.610
It told me to use my bayard.

02:56.730 --> 02:59.264
Then, just nothing.

02:59.507 --> 03:01.721
I woke up, and I was
back on a Galra ship.

03:02.765 --> 03:03.946
Well,

03:04.452 --> 03:07.410
you'd just unlocked the Black
Lion's ability to teleport.

03:07.530 --> 03:09.288
Could it have teleported you?

03:09.408 --> 03:11.120
Maybe it was trying to save you.

03:12.170 --> 03:14.750
By teleporting me into
the hands of the Galra?

03:14.880 --> 03:17.920
Maybe Zarkon forced it to.

03:18.050 --> 03:20.052
He was trying to control the Black Lion

03:20.172 --> 03:21.970
up until the very last moment, right?

03:22.090 --> 03:23.930
Yeah, maybe.

03:24.544 --> 03:27.232
Well, if you're feeling up to it,

03:27.352 --> 03:29.190
the rest of the team would be thrilled

03:29.310 --> 03:31.230
to see you up and around again.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.270
They need you, you know.

03:35.650 --> 03:38.030
Yeah, I'll try.

03:38.150 --> 03:40.990
Okay, we'll be on the bridge.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.370
- Hey, Keith?
- Yeah.

03:45.490 --> 03:47.459
How many times are you gonna have

03:47.579 --> 03:49.284
to save me before this is over?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.410
As many times as it takes.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.519
Great job out there, everyone.

04:04.639 --> 04:07.050
You've really turned
the tide in this war.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.020
I'm glad you never lost sight of
the mission while I was gone.

04:10.140 --> 04:12.430
You're looking better.
How are you feeling?

04:12.560 --> 04:15.520
Good. Just trying to get
rid of this weird headache.

04:15.650 --> 04:18.110
Guys, I think I have something here!

04:18.230 --> 04:21.482
So, I downloaded Intel from the
Galra base we just defeated.

04:21.601 --> 04:23.566
I untied the quantum-folded encryption,

04:23.686 --> 04:25.490
and I found something on Lotor.

04:25.610 --> 04:28.160
- Do you know where he is?
- Well, not exactly, no,

04:28.280 --> 04:30.450
but the last three sightings
of his command ship

04:30.580 --> 04:32.330
have been in the Va'Kar quadrant.

04:32.450 --> 04:33.896
Nice work, Pidge.

04:34.016 --> 04:36.500
Although, those quadrants are massive.

04:36.630 --> 04:38.920
How will we pinpoint his location?

04:39.040 --> 04:42.170
Hey, that comet is made from
the same material as Voltron.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.680
Maybe I can scan the emission
spectrum for Fraunhofer lines,

04:44.800 --> 04:46.220
like when I found the Blue Lion!

04:46.340 --> 04:48.970
But you know those emissions are
subject to free induction decay.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.850
Those are exponential drop-offs.

04:50.970 --> 04:53.390
Yeah, but if you could find a
way to amplify the sensors...

04:53.520 --> 04:55.520
No, there'd be way too
much interference.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.980
What if, instead, we
increase the SA magnitude?

04:58.110 --> 05:00.020
The spires of the Castle!

05:00.150 --> 05:01.650
Genius!

05:03.610 --> 05:06.280
I have no idea what
either of them just said.

05:06.410 --> 05:08.309
Let's set a course for
the Va'Kar quadrant

05:08.315 --> 05:10.120
while they get started on that detector.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.207
We need to work fast.

05:12.327 --> 05:15.033
Who knows what Lotor
has planned for that comet?

05:17.509 --> 05:19.710
Yeah?

05:22.971 --> 05:25.670
Hey, man. I just wanted to
talk with you because...

05:26.340 --> 05:29.180
Well, because I've been
worrying about something.

05:30.390 --> 05:32.970
Must really be bothering you if
you're coming to talk to me.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.020
Well, I mean, you're
the leader now, right?

05:35.890 --> 05:38.350
- I guess.
- I've been doing some math.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.519
With Shiro back, that
makes six paladins,

05:40.639 --> 05:42.270
but there are only five lions,

05:42.400 --> 05:45.320
and if I'm right, that's
one paladin too many.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.780
Solid math.

05:47.910 --> 05:49.660
Look, when Shiro takes
over the Black Lion,

05:49.780 --> 05:51.660
you're going to want your Red Lion back.

05:51.780 --> 05:54.660
If I get a lion, I'd have
to take Blue from Allura.

05:54.790 --> 05:57.370
But she's progressed a lot
faster than any of us did.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.580
She might even be able to
unlock powers we don't know of.

06:00.710 --> 06:01.790
That's true.

06:02.573 --> 06:03.707
So,

06:03.827 --> 06:07.050
maybe the best thing I can
do for the team is step aside.

06:07.170 --> 06:09.220
What are you talking about?

06:09.340 --> 06:12.140
This isn't a participation game.
This is war.

06:12.260 --> 06:14.470
And you want your best
soldiers on the front lines.

06:14.590 --> 06:16.704
Stop worrying about who flies what

06:16.824 --> 06:18.600
and just focus on your missions.

06:18.730 --> 06:20.400
Things will work themselves out.

06:22.610 --> 06:24.940
Okay. Thanks.

06:27.030 --> 06:28.320
And, Lance...

06:29.030 --> 06:31.820
leave the math to Pidge.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.830
Thanks for hooking me into the system.

06:43.210 --> 06:45.340
I would've never been
able to reach back there.

06:45.460 --> 06:48.760
Sorry, I know you got all dirty.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.140
I owe you guys a little
mouse shower now, okay?

06:51.260 --> 06:53.680
I'm gonna get to work on
that right after we find Lotor.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.680
Hey, can we fire this
up and see if it works?

07:08.472 --> 07:09.635
Uh...

07:09.755 --> 07:12.570
Maybe we didn't adjust
the polarity correctly.

07:19.780 --> 07:21.256
Uh, guys! Guys,

07:21.376 --> 07:24.080
I found the comet, but it's
booking it away from us!

07:24.200 --> 07:25.717
Coran? Allura?

07:25.837 --> 07:28.340
Can someone Altean
come move this Castle?

07:28.460 --> 07:30.010
Well done. We're on our way.

07:36.930 --> 07:38.270
Okay, we're gaining on it.

07:38.390 --> 07:41.350
Make sure we stay far back
enough to be undetected.

07:50.570 --> 07:53.450
Looks like the signal stopped
in the Ulippa System.

07:53.570 --> 07:55.370
Activating long-range scanners.

08:02.790 --> 08:04.500
That's not Lotor's ship.

08:05.500 --> 08:08.250
But the comet is in there.

08:09.123 --> 08:11.920
- Okay, team, we need to get that...
- Here's the plan, everyone.

08:12.050 --> 08:14.998
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Shiro.

08:15.118 --> 08:16.649
We need to get that comet.

08:16.769 --> 08:18.760
They must be transporting
it into that base.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.625
It'll be vulnerable during the transfer.

08:20.745 --> 08:22.600
That's the best time to strike.

08:38.240 --> 08:41.289
Who the heck are these guys?

08:41.409 --> 08:43.960
I don't think they're moving
the comet to that base.

08:44.080 --> 08:47.460
- We need more information.
- You're right. You take the Black Lion.

08:47.580 --> 08:49.840
I'll stay with Coran in the
Castle and provide support.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.800
Keith, are you sure?

08:53.510 --> 08:54.930
I'm sure.

09:06.148 --> 09:07.480
What's wrong?

09:07.600 --> 09:10.770
Shiro, where are you?
We need you right now!

09:21.030 --> 09:23.290
Keith, I'm gonna need you
to lead this mission.

09:23.410 --> 09:25.428
What? What is it? What's wrong?

09:25.860 --> 09:28.355
The Black Lion isn't responding to me.

09:28.475 --> 09:31.170
It looks like you're
its true paladin now.

09:31.772 --> 09:32.960
I'm coming down.

09:38.090 --> 09:41.140
This may be the worst
post in the Galra Empire.

09:41.260 --> 09:45.100
But it's my post! Victory or death!

10:03.631 --> 10:06.660
The most important thing is for
you to get eyes on that comet.

10:06.790 --> 10:09.000
Second is figuring out
who we're dealing with.

10:32.900 --> 10:39.030
You! Lotor sent you to
finish off what he started?

10:43.139 --> 10:45.330
Shiro, we've just boarded the ship.

10:45.450 --> 10:48.040
There's no crew in sight.
Moving forward with the search.

11:06.060 --> 11:07.390
This way.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.382
- Let me finish him off!
- No,

11:18.502 --> 11:20.280
you know the plan!

11:20.400 --> 11:22.195
My life doesn't matter.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.950
All that matters is the empire!

11:36.840 --> 11:38.170
Shutting down security.

11:55.810 --> 11:58.005
Sounds like the fight next door is over.

11:58.125 --> 11:59.703
Let's hurry.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.200
Retracting roof.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.170
Coran, give me a closer look at that.

12:23.130 --> 12:24.630
Is that...?

12:30.770 --> 12:32.180
The teludav!

12:32.310 --> 12:36.020
What, in the name of King
Groggery the Infirm, is going on?

12:45.990 --> 12:48.700
The comet should be in here.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.410
Like, right here.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.090
Where's the comet? Is it in that ship?

13:03.260 --> 13:05.510
I think the ship is the comet.

13:06.220 --> 13:09.430
No, it can't be! He's already
made a ship from the comet's ore?

13:09.550 --> 13:12.180
- Oh, this is bad.
- More like horrible.

13:12.310 --> 13:13.310
Guys...

13:14.520 --> 13:17.520
There's a piece of the teludav
inside the Galra base.

13:17.650 --> 13:19.860
The one we used to
wormhole Zarkon's ship?

13:19.980 --> 13:21.933
But they would never be able to operate

13:22.053 --> 13:23.778
it without an Altean...

13:28.870 --> 13:32.240
Zarkon's witch! She had Altean markings.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.922
Is anyone else kind of freaking out?

13:35.042 --> 13:37.250
Yep, mark me down for one freak-out.

13:37.370 --> 13:39.140
Lotor must be nearby.

13:39.260 --> 13:41.418
We need to find him and
take him out for good.

13:41.538 --> 13:43.840
Team, you cannot let
Lotor get that ship.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.550
You need to get back to
your lions. You need Voltron!

13:46.680 --> 13:48.842
Why take out one ship when we can stop

13:48.962 --> 13:50.890
all of this by taking out Lotor himself?

13:51.010 --> 13:52.970
We can't let him keep outsmarting us.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.480
That's exactly why we can't risk
letting Lotor have that ship.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.020
This is too important.

13:58.140 --> 14:00.480
Keith, I want to stop Lotor just as

14:00.600 --> 14:02.926
badly as you, but Shiro has a point.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.430
Okay, you guys go back to the lions.

14:06.550 --> 14:08.539
I'm gonna search the ship for Lotor.

14:08.910 --> 14:11.740
Keith, you need to stick together.

14:11.870 --> 14:13.910
- Yeah, I'm with Shiro on this one.
- As am I.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.250
- Me, too.
- Yeah, man.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.790
Fine. Let's move.

14:30.010 --> 14:31.220
Huh?

14:34.680 --> 14:35.810
Yah!

15:08.210 --> 15:10.010
I got you, buddy!

15:21.560 --> 15:24.110
Huh?

15:34.700 --> 15:36.240
Pidge, a little help?

15:45.630 --> 15:48.920
t's been a long time since
I've faced a worthy opponent.

15:49.050 --> 15:51.680
I'm going to enjoy crushing you.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.150
We don't have time for this.
We need to get to the lions.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.700
Good idea.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.410
Zethrid, stop!

16:14.530 --> 16:15.828
Come on!

16:15.948 --> 16:17.620
This is our chance to destroy them!

16:17.740 --> 16:20.410
We have what we came
for. Stick to the plan.

16:29.944 --> 16:31.996
Okay, seriously, what is going on?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.510
I mean, who were they?

16:33.630 --> 16:35.840
I've met one of them
before, in the weblum.

16:35.970 --> 16:37.724
She stole some of the scaultrite.

16:37.844 --> 16:39.480
Allura, you said they had an Altean?

16:39.600 --> 16:42.680
They must be trying to build a
teludav so they can make wormholes.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.947
If Lotor has turned
the comet into a ship,

16:45.067 --> 16:46.640
we have much bigger concerns.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.003
I thought Lotor took over for Zarkon.

16:49.123 --> 16:51.110
Why is he attacking a Galra base?

16:51.230 --> 16:53.210
I don't know. That's why we

16:53.330 --> 16:55.330
have to stop him here and now.

17:20.185 --> 17:22.512
We have to stop that cargo ship.

17:22.632 --> 17:24.140
On it.

17:36.110 --> 17:38.240
That must be the ship
made from the comet.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.788
Then let's be careful.
Raise particle barrier.

17:40.908 --> 17:42.910
Fire Castle defenses.

17:53.210 --> 17:55.090
A quick little bugger, isn't it?

17:55.220 --> 17:57.590
I've never seen something
that size move that fast.

18:17.650 --> 18:19.950
That blast cut right through
the particle barrier!

18:20.070 --> 18:21.620
Team, where are you?

18:26.330 --> 18:29.420
We can't take another hit like that!

18:40.680 --> 18:42.390
Form sword!

18:46.720 --> 18:48.672
Keep Voltron engaged until the

18:48.792 --> 18:50.897
cargo ship is out of range.

18:55.020 --> 18:56.584
Do not be drawn in.

18:56.704 --> 18:59.199
The sword strike is
his most deadly blow.

19:07.040 --> 19:10.524
- It's too quick!
- Guys, the cargo ship is escaping

19:10.644 --> 19:13.371
- with the teludav inside of it.
- I thought taking down

19:13.491 --> 19:15.929
the ship made from the comet
was the most important thing.

19:16.049 --> 19:18.630
We still can't let Lotor
get away with the teludav.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.760
Shiro's right. We need to destroy it.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.720
But the comet is right here!
We need to take it down!

19:32.100 --> 19:34.900
Keith, the cargo ship is getting away!

19:49.950 --> 19:51.620
We have them right where we want them.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.052
They can either defend

19:53.172 --> 19:55.960
or go after the teludav and
leave themselves vulnerable.

19:59.712 --> 20:01.756
Guys, the teludav's getting away.

20:01.762 --> 20:03.185
Keith, what should we do?

20:03.305 --> 20:05.210
You're going to have
to lower your shield,

20:05.330 --> 20:07.930
shoot the cargo ship, and
deal with the consequences.

20:08.060 --> 20:11.680
We can beat this ship first,
and then get the cargo ship.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.270
There's not enough time!

20:13.390 --> 20:15.655
You need to make a decision!

20:16.690 --> 20:18.360
Hunk, get your bayard ready.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.333
On my cue, we're gonna lower the

20:20.453 --> 20:22.150
shield and shoot the cargo ship.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.860
- Ready?
- Ready!

20:23.990 --> 20:25.820
They're going to attack the cargo ship.

20:25.950 --> 20:28.450
Prepare to fire as soon
as the shield goes down.

20:29.450 --> 20:30.450
Go!

20:34.370 --> 20:36.170
Fire now!

20:53.690 --> 20:55.520
Fire again!

21:18.960 --> 21:21.880
Your failure is most disappointing.

21:22.010 --> 21:24.045
Return before more Galra ships

21:24.165 --> 21:25.827
converge on your location.

21:36.133 --> 21:38.902
So, Lotor was attacking the Galra

21:39.022 --> 21:41.610
base and trying to steal the teludav?

21:41.730 --> 21:43.360
None of this makes any sense.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.650
We can talk about this later.
They're getting away!

21:45.770 --> 21:47.848
- We need to go after them.
- No.

21:47.968 --> 21:49.740
Get back to the Castle.

21:49.870 --> 21:53.200
Something strange is going on
here, and we need to figure it out.

21:58.231 --> 22:00.853
I'm sorry I had to step in back there.

22:00.973 --> 22:03.420
I thought I had it under control.

22:04.685 --> 22:07.053
You need to learn to pick your battles.

22:07.173 --> 22:09.680
Sometimes, you have
to make hard choices.

22:11.100 --> 22:14.170
- I'm no good at this.
- Yes, you are.

22:14.423 --> 22:16.680
It was your quick thinking
that prevented Lotor

22:16.810 --> 22:18.810
from getting away with the teludav.

22:19.369 --> 22:20.610
You're gonna get there.

22:21.731 --> 22:23.998
The Black Lion has chosen you.

22:24.252 --> 22:26.440
I'm proud of you, Keith.

22:32.550 --> 22:35.500
I can't remember anything,
except that whoever it was

22:35.620 --> 22:37.120
had the correct landing codes.

22:37.250 --> 22:39.580
I swear! You must believe me!

22:39.710 --> 22:41.419
I believe you,

22:41.539 --> 22:44.140
but you still must pay for your failure.
