00:00.694 --> 00:02.229
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:02.229 --> 00:04.670
HANLEY, YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TALENTS!

00:04.670 --> 00:05.793
TAKE A RISK!

00:05.793 --> 00:08.486
YOU BETTER NOT
BE LYING TO ME.
WHY? 'CAUSE YOU NEVER LIE?

00:08.486 --> 00:09.674
YOU DON'T EVEN
LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

00:09.674 --> 00:10.842
SHE'S AN I.T. TECH
AT KARSTEN ALLIED.

00:10.842 --> 00:12.277
THIS GIRL COULD BE
A GOLD MINE.

00:12.277 --> 00:14.778
WHAT ABOUT ELAINE?
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

00:14.778 --> 00:15.888
A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.

00:15.888 --> 00:17.123
I KNOW YOU THINK
I STOLE YOUR MONEY.

00:17.123 --> 00:18.357
I-I -- NO! I -- HEY!

00:18.357 --> 00:19.558
DID YOU KILL LOU
TO COVER IT UP?

00:19.558 --> 00:20.726
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY!

00:20.726 --> 00:23.496
ARE YOU READY
TO GO TO PRISON FOR KARSTEN?

00:23.496 --> 00:26.732
THE PERSON WHO PUT THE GUN IN
T.J.'s CAR WAS JACK McALLISTER.

00:26.732 --> 00:29.769
JACK IS THE ONE
WHO KILLED LOU MROZEK.

00:32.204 --> 00:33.472
JACK McALLISTER?

00:33.472 --> 00:34.740
YEAH.

00:34.740 --> 00:36.242
KILLED LOU MROZEK.
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:36.242 --> 00:37.810
WHY?

00:37.810 --> 00:40.346
BECAUSE LOU WAS GONNA
TURN HIM IN TO THE FBI.

00:40.346 --> 00:41.914
TURN HIM IN FOR WHAT?

00:41.914 --> 00:44.750
FOR STEALING,
MR. STAFFORD.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.385
JACK WAS STEALING
FROM ME.

00:46.385 --> 00:48.821
A VERY LARGE
SUM OF MONEY.

00:48.821 --> 00:49.922
LOU FOUND OUT ABOUT IT,

00:49.922 --> 00:53.092
AND JACK KILLED HIM
BEFORE HE COULD TALK.

00:54.226 --> 00:57.296
IT'S ALL IN HERE.

00:59.732 --> 01:03.035
T.J. WAS WITH LOU
THE NIGHT HE WAS KILLED.

01:03.035 --> 01:06.672
THE GUN USED TO KILL LOU
WAS FOUND IN YOUR SON'S CAR.

01:06.672 --> 01:09.508
ALL EVIDENCE
POINTS TO YOUR SON, T.J.

01:09.508 --> 01:11.610
THAT EVIDENCE
DOESN'T HOLD WATER.

01:11.610 --> 01:13.713
WHY WOULD T.J. KILL LOU?

01:13.713 --> 01:15.681
BECAUSE YOU TOLD HIM TO.

01:15.681 --> 01:21.053
I SENT MY BRAIN-DAMAGED SON
TO KILL HIS UNCLE?

01:21.053 --> 01:24.623
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
VERY CLEARLY, MR. STAFFORD.

01:24.623 --> 01:27.460
HE'S TURNED YOU
UPSIDE DOWN.

01:27.460 --> 01:29.228
WHO?

01:29.228 --> 01:33.766
JACK. IT'S WHAT HE DOES.
HE MANIPULATES PEOPLE.

01:33.766 --> 01:36.102
I'M NOT BEING MANIPULATED
BY JACK McALLISTER.

01:36.102 --> 01:38.270
PLEASE.
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

01:38.270 --> 01:42.408
LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE TO YOU,
WHAT HE'S TAKEN FROM YOU.

01:42.408 --> 01:45.811
YOU LEAVE HER
OUT OF THIS.

01:45.811 --> 01:48.147
LEAVE HER OUT OF IT?

01:48.147 --> 01:50.750
YOU REALLY DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

01:50.750 --> 01:54.487
YOU THINK JACK SLEEPING
WITH YOUR WIFE WAS AN ACCIDENT,

01:54.487 --> 01:55.921
THAT IT WAS A COINCIDENCE

01:55.921 --> 01:58.324
THAT YOU WERE ASSIGNED
TO THE MROZEK CASE?

01:58.324 --> 02:02.795
WITH JACK McALLISTER,
THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS.

02:02.795 --> 02:05.164
<i>NOTHING</i>
IS LEFT TO CHANCE.

02:05.164 --> 02:08.134
HE PLAYED YOU.

02:08.134 --> 02:12.638
HE PLAYED ME...
MY DAUGHTER, YOUR WIFE.

02:12.638 --> 02:15.474
JACK PLAYS EVERYONE.

02:15.474 --> 02:19.111
HE'S A CON MAN,
A THIEF...

02:21.013 --> 02:22.915
...A KILLER.

02:25.684 --> 02:28.687
-- Captions by VITAC --

02:39.131 --> 02:42.168
NICE KICKS.

02:42.168 --> 02:44.136
I LIKE
WHEN YOU SAY "KICKS."

02:45.471 --> 02:48.641
YEAH, I NEED A PLUMBER.

02:48.641 --> 02:50.976
SO, YOU SAID
YOU HAD A BIG STORY FOR ME.

02:50.976 --> 02:54.480
THIS ONE
GETS US THE PULITZER.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.682
OR KILLED.
POSSIBLY BOTH.

02:56.682 --> 02:58.684
HMM. THIS IS A ZEBRA.

02:58.684 --> 03:03.289
YEAH. YEAH, IT IS.
SORRY. WRONG FOLDER.

03:03.289 --> 03:06.625
CORRUPTION,
FRAUD, THREATS,

03:06.625 --> 03:10.663
EXTORTION, KICKBACKS...
MURDER!

03:10.663 --> 03:13.232
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACT MORE
WHEN I SAY "MURDER."

03:13.232 --> 03:14.733
WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT HERE?

03:14.733 --> 03:17.236
WHAT ELSE? CHICAGO REAL ESTATE,
MAJOR DEVELOPERS --

03:17.236 --> 03:20.606
DODSON & READ,
VXG, KARSTEN ALLIED.

03:22.341 --> 03:25.010
WHAT? ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
WHERE TO PUT YOUR PULITZER?

03:25.010 --> 03:27.179
IT'S A SMALL MEDAL.
YOU CAN HANG IT ANYWHERE.

03:27.179 --> 03:28.681
I CAN'T DO THIS, NATE.

03:28.681 --> 03:31.484
IS IT BECAUSE
OF McALLISTER?

03:31.484 --> 03:33.719
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T THINK
HE'D APPRECIATE ME

03:33.719 --> 03:35.387
BEING INVOLVED IN THIS,
NOT RIGHT NOW.

03:35.387 --> 03:36.489
FAIR ENOUGH.

03:36.489 --> 03:40.326
I GUESS IT WILL JUST BE
ME AND HIM, THEN.

03:40.326 --> 03:41.594
YOU AND WHO?

03:41.594 --> 03:43.896
McALLISTER.
HE ALREADY AGREED TO HELP.

03:43.896 --> 03:46.532
WE WERE JUST
LOOKING FOR A PHOTOGRAPHER.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.537
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA
NEED A PLUMBER.

03:56.175 --> 03:58.511
HEY.
HI.

04:00.713 --> 04:03.382
IS SHE READY? I'M TAKING HER
TO LOGAN HARDWARE.

04:03.382 --> 04:04.383
YOU KNOW --

04:04.383 --> 04:05.551
IT'S NOT
A HARDWARE STORE?

04:05.551 --> 04:07.820
IT'S A RECORD STORE.
YEAH.

04:07.820 --> 04:10.723
UM, VAL'S ACTUALLY
NOT FEELING WELL.

04:10.723 --> 04:13.392
SHE HAS, LIKE,
A FEVER.

04:13.392 --> 04:14.760
"LIKE, A FEVER."

04:14.760 --> 04:16.362
RIGHT.

04:16.362 --> 04:18.797
HEY, VIC.

04:18.797 --> 04:19.965
HEY.
HOW'S IT GOING?

04:19.965 --> 04:21.467
HEY, HEY, HEY,
HOLD ON A MOMENT.

04:21.467 --> 04:22.968
I GOT TO GO.

04:24.803 --> 04:27.239
IS ELAINE AROUND?

04:27.239 --> 04:32.178
NO, BUT SHE LEFT SOME CLOTHES
FOR YOU THERE IN THAT BAG.

04:33.979 --> 04:37.149
IT'S A GREAT VISIT.

04:38.484 --> 04:40.786
I'M SORRY.
JULES, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

04:40.786 --> 04:43.255
FINE. YEAH.

04:45.291 --> 04:47.893
WILL YOU TELL VAL
I HOPE SHE FEELS BETTER?

04:47.893 --> 04:49.795
WE'LL TRY AGAIN
ANOTHER DAY.

04:49.795 --> 04:51.297
OF COURSE.

04:51.297 --> 04:53.465
THANK YOU.
YEAH.

05:06.011 --> 05:09.348
HMM. VELVETY.

05:09.348 --> 05:11.016
IT'S LOW ACIDITY.

05:11.016 --> 05:12.685
THIS WINE GIBBERISH
IS WEIRDLY SEXY.

05:12.685 --> 05:14.019
NO,
IT'S NOT GIBBERISH.

05:14.019 --> 05:15.187
MM-HMM.
LET'S SEE.

05:15.187 --> 05:16.689
OH, ELEGANT.

05:16.689 --> 05:18.958
BUT, UH,
VERY LIGHT-BODIED.

05:18.958 --> 05:20.693
OOH,
YOU'RE SELLING IT.

05:20.693 --> 05:23.929
ENJOY NOW, BUT WILL CONTINUE
TO AGE GRACEFULLY.

05:24.930 --> 05:26.865
HELLO.
HI.

05:32.004 --> 05:33.505
YOUR RING.

05:33.505 --> 05:34.840
YEAH.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.776
YEAH, I FIGURED
IT WAS ABOUT TIME.

05:37.776 --> 05:40.946
MAKES THINGS
LESS COMPLICATED.

05:42.548 --> 05:45.050
UH-OH.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:45.050 --> 05:46.151
NOW THIS SCARES YOU.

05:46.151 --> 05:47.786
NO.

05:50.122 --> 05:51.323
YES.

05:51.323 --> 05:56.161
LOOK, I WAS THINKING
YOU HAVE BEEN MARRIED 20 YEARS.

05:56.161 --> 05:58.797
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FIVE MINUTES.
UH-HUH.

05:58.797 --> 06:02.668
AND IT COULD GET MESSY
WITH THE WORK SITUATION.

06:02.668 --> 06:04.837
WAIT A MINUTE.

06:04.837 --> 06:06.238
ARE YOU
BREAKING UP WITH ME?

06:06.238 --> 06:08.140
I THINK
WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

06:08.140 --> 06:10.476
WHOA. OKAY.

06:10.476 --> 06:11.977
UH...

06:11.977 --> 06:13.846
WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE BREAKING UP?

06:13.846 --> 06:15.481
US.

06:15.481 --> 06:17.316
THIS.

06:18.317 --> 06:20.185
THERE IS NO "US."

06:20.185 --> 06:22.855
"THIS" IS JUST...

06:22.855 --> 06:24.757
IT'S JUT TWO PEOPLE
HAVING FUN.

06:24.757 --> 06:26.925
LOOK, ELAINE, I'M NOT THE GUY
YOU THINK I AM.

06:26.925 --> 06:29.528
I THINK THAT YOU'RE THE GUY
WHO MAKES ME LAUGH

06:29.528 --> 06:31.897
AND MAKES ME BRUNCH
AND MAKES ME FEEL GOOD

06:31.897 --> 06:33.332
AND WHO'S NOT COMPLICATED.

06:33.332 --> 06:36.669
AND BEYOND THAT,
I DON'T REALLY CARE WHO YOU ARE.

06:36.669 --> 06:39.972
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE.

06:41.573 --> 06:43.942
OKAY.

06:43.942 --> 06:45.110
NONE TAKEN.

06:49.548 --> 06:52.551
IT WAS LIKE "DRIP, DRIP, DRIP"
ALL MORNING,

06:52.551 --> 06:54.553
AND THEN "WHOOSH,"
AND THE PIPE BURST.

06:54.553 --> 06:56.221
DID YOU
CALL YOUR LANDLORD?

06:56.221 --> 06:58.123
NO,
I CALLED MY LAWYER.

06:59.625 --> 07:00.959
WELL, YOUR LAWYER THINKS

07:00.959 --> 07:03.262
YOU MIGHT NEED TO
CALL YOUR LANDLORD.

07:03.262 --> 07:05.264
HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK
I WANT TO RAISE ANY ISSUES NOW.

07:05.264 --> 07:06.265
THIS IS A WORK SPACE.

07:06.265 --> 07:08.767
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
LIVING HERE.

07:12.371 --> 07:14.373
I TALKED TO NATE,
JACK.

07:16.108 --> 07:18.444
I WAS
GONNA TELL YOU TODAY.

07:18.444 --> 07:20.412
WHY ARE YOU DOING IT?

07:20.412 --> 07:22.948
'CAUSE I NEED TO.

07:22.948 --> 07:25.784
I CAN'T COOPERATE
WITH A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION,

07:25.784 --> 07:27.119
BUT I-I HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING

07:27.119 --> 07:30.823
TO...ACCOUNT FOR
WHAT I WAS INVOLVED IN.

07:30.823 --> 07:34.226
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.
I-I THINK IT'S GREAT.

07:34.226 --> 07:36.895
WELL, WE'LL SEE.

07:38.931 --> 07:43.102
THERE'S THINGS THAT ARE GONNA
COME OUT THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF.

07:43.102 --> 07:45.838
WHAT THINGS?

07:45.838 --> 07:48.040
DIFFICULT THINGS.

07:49.842 --> 07:52.845
BUT IT'S NOT WHO I AM ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

07:54.847 --> 07:57.182
YEAH. YEAH, I KNOW.

07:57.182 --> 07:59.885
I'M REALLY READY
TO MOVE ON FROM ALL THIS.

08:16.335 --> 08:19.671
NUMBER 16.

08:19.671 --> 08:22.841
NUMBER 16.

08:22.841 --> 08:23.976
NUMBER 16.

08:27.646 --> 08:29.648
SOONER OR LATER...

08:29.648 --> 08:33.085
EVERYBODY SITS DOWN
TO A BANQUET OF CONSEQUENCES.

09:12.762 --> 09:13.930
HEY!

09:13.930 --> 09:15.431
HEY, DAD.
I HAVE HOMEWORK.

09:15.431 --> 09:16.900
YOU'RE IN FIRST GRADE.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.001
HE'S IN FIRST GRADE.

09:18.001 --> 09:19.802
HE'LL BE STUDYING
FOR HIS LSATs NEXT YEAR.

09:19.802 --> 09:22.772
NOT THAT
I EXPECT HIM TO BE A...

09:22.772 --> 09:26.042
OKAY.
ANYWAY, HOW ARE YOU?

09:26.042 --> 09:31.381
I-I OPENED THE ENVELOPE,
THE DIVORCE PAPERS.

09:31.381 --> 09:33.216
I'M GETTING A LAWYER,
DREW.

09:33.216 --> 09:34.217
OF COURSE.

09:34.217 --> 09:36.753
A GOOD LAWYER.

09:36.753 --> 09:39.055
Y-YOU SHOULD.

09:39.055 --> 09:41.324
OKAY.
DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?

09:41.324 --> 09:43.326
IT'S A PROCESS.

09:43.326 --> 09:48.164
LAWYERS ARE PART OF THE PROCESS.
I UNDERSTAND.

09:48.164 --> 09:50.433
YOU SEEM DIFFERENT.
YEAH?

09:50.433 --> 09:51.935
I DON'T KNOW.

09:51.935 --> 09:55.271
BACK INTO WORK,
I GUESS.

09:55.271 --> 09:56.472
NEW CASE?

09:56.472 --> 09:59.576
OLD CASE. NEW AGAIN.

10:02.412 --> 10:07.750
SO, YOU REMEMBER
THAT SERIES FOR<i> WICKER PARK,</i>

10:07.750 --> 10:09.485
"25 RISING STARS"?

10:09.485 --> 10:11.321
HARD TO FORGET.

10:11.321 --> 10:15.091
WELL, I STILL OWE THE PHOTO.
LIKE TO STILL DO IT?

10:15.091 --> 10:17.093
YOU COULD
COME BY THE STUDIO.

10:17.093 --> 10:18.761
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

10:18.761 --> 10:19.996
YEAH, I'M SERIOUS.

10:19.996 --> 10:22.565
BROKEN MARRIAGE.
WORKING D.U.I.s.

10:22.565 --> 10:24.033
NOT EXACTLY RISING.

10:24.033 --> 10:25.735
OH, DREW,
YOU'RE A GREAT LAWYER,

10:25.735 --> 10:27.637
AND THEY STILL
REALLY WANT YOU IN IT.

10:27.637 --> 10:31.541
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.

10:31.541 --> 10:33.309
TOMORROW?

10:33.309 --> 10:34.644
TOMORROW IS GREAT.

10:34.644 --> 10:36.813
COOL.

10:36.813 --> 10:37.914
OKAY.

10:40.049 --> 10:41.217
BYE, BABE.

10:41.217 --> 10:42.719
BYE, MOM.

10:44.187 --> 10:46.990
APPRECIATE THE HELP.

10:46.990 --> 10:49.659
WE'RE NOT GOING OUT,
ARE WE?

10:49.659 --> 10:50.660
SHARKS.

10:50.660 --> 10:52.695
THIS IS A LAKE.
NO SHARKS.

10:52.695 --> 10:53.696
THERE ARE BULL SHARKS.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.231
THERE ARE NO BULL SHARKS.

10:55.231 --> 10:57.066
I'VE HEARD
THERE ARE BULL SHARKS.

10:57.066 --> 10:58.167
WE'RE NOT GOING OUT.

10:58.167 --> 10:59.335
I'D PREFER THAT.

11:01.004 --> 11:04.574
LOOK, BEFORE WE GET STARTED,
I NEED SOMETHING FROM YOU.

11:04.574 --> 11:07.043
A PROMISE.
I PROTECT MY SOURCES.

11:07.043 --> 11:08.511
UNLESS I'M GOING TO JAIL,

11:08.511 --> 11:11.214
AND THEN I COUGH THEM UP
IN A NEW YORK MINUTE.

11:11.214 --> 11:12.215
JOKE.

11:12.215 --> 11:14.817
OKAY,
WHAT'S THE PROMISE?

11:16.019 --> 11:19.922
LOOK, PROMISE ME
YOU'LL LOOK INTO THIS

11:19.922 --> 11:21.257
AS PART OF
THE INVESTIGATION.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.896
CONSTRUCTION ACCIDENT
26 YEARS AGO, 2 DEATHS.

11:26.896 --> 11:28.031
WHAT'S THE STORY?

11:28.031 --> 11:29.699
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME.

11:29.699 --> 11:31.534
WHO ARE THEY,
THE TWO PEOPLE?

11:31.534 --> 11:34.270
MY PARENTS.

11:41.544 --> 11:43.212
VIC.

11:43.212 --> 11:45.081
THIS YOUR KID?

11:45.081 --> 11:46.582
YES, VIC McALLISTER.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:46.582 --> 11:50.420
HE TOOK A STROLL
ACROSS THE STREET --

11:50.420 --> 11:53.356
<i>THAT</i> STREET.
SIX LANES.

11:58.795 --> 12:00.797
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

12:00.797 --> 12:04.400
IT WAS MY FAULT.
I DARED HIM TO DO IT.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.070
WELL, THAT WAS STUPID.

12:07.070 --> 12:09.572
AND YOU WERE STUPID
TO DO IT.

12:09.572 --> 12:11.541
YOU SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

12:11.541 --> 12:13.409
I AM. YOU OKAY?

12:13.409 --> 12:15.645
YEAH.

12:15.645 --> 12:18.715
NUMBER 16.
I MADE IT TO GO.

12:27.390 --> 12:29.559
LET'S TALK ABOUT
KARSTEN ALLIED'S

12:29.559 --> 12:31.260
STREETERVILLE DEVELOPMENT.

12:31.260 --> 12:33.463
IT'S A LONG STORY.

12:33.463 --> 12:35.631
I'VE GOT ALL DAY.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.266
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO.

12:38.267 --> 12:40.269
HELLO?

12:40.269 --> 12:41.337
YEAH?

12:44.841 --> 12:46.109
OKAY, GREAT. UM...

12:46.109 --> 12:47.110
GRAND AND KINGSBURY.

12:47.110 --> 12:48.378
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU IN AN HOUR.

12:49.312 --> 12:51.481
MAKE IT TWO.

12:51.481 --> 12:52.482
ALL RIGHT.

12:52.482 --> 12:54.450
DRUG DEALER.

12:54.450 --> 12:56.786
CLOSE.
REAL-ESTATE AGENT.

12:56.786 --> 12:59.122
ALL RIGHT.

12:59.122 --> 13:01.124
STREETERVILLE.

13:03.159 --> 13:06.662
HELLO?

13:06.662 --> 13:08.798
ANYBODY HERE?

13:08.798 --> 13:10.032
RODNEY!

13:10.032 --> 13:14.003
BEFORE YOU STARTED
SHOWING UP HERE EVERY DAY,

13:14.003 --> 13:15.505
I ENJOYED
COMING TO WORK.

13:15.505 --> 13:17.673
I GENUINELY ENJOYED IT.

13:17.673 --> 13:20.676
HOW MANY PEOPLE
CAN SAY THAT?

13:20.676 --> 13:23.513
YOU TOLD ME LIL' D
FOUND THE GUN IN T.J.'s CAR.

13:23.513 --> 13:25.515
YES.

13:25.515 --> 13:29.018
THEN IT STRIKES ME.
DIDN'T T.J. ASK ABOUT IT?

13:29.018 --> 13:31.387
NO.
NO.

13:31.387 --> 13:32.555
HE DIDN'T SAY,

13:32.555 --> 13:34.424
"HEY, GUYS, I LEFT
A MURDER WEAPON IN MY TRUNK.

13:34.424 --> 13:35.458
DID SOMEONE GRAB IT?"

13:35.458 --> 13:37.894
IT'S NOT LIKE
GETTING A COUPLE QUARTERS

13:37.894 --> 13:40.329
SWIPED OUT OF YOUR CAR
AT THE CAR WASH.

13:40.329 --> 13:42.665
IT'S KIND OF
A BIG DEAL.

13:42.665 --> 13:44.333
I TOLD YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

13:44.333 --> 13:47.670
WELL, SEE, I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE JUST TELLING ME

13:47.670 --> 13:48.838
WHAT I WANT TO HEAR.

13:48.838 --> 13:52.175
IT'S NOT
VERY HELPFUL TO ME.

13:55.845 --> 13:57.847
NOW, I AM DONE
PLAYING AROUND WITH YOU!

13:57.847 --> 13:58.881
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.516
WHO DROVE THAT IMPALA
IN HERE?

14:00.516 --> 14:02.418
T.J.

14:02.418 --> 14:03.519
WHERE WAS THE GUN?

14:03.519 --> 14:05.521
IN THE TRUNK,
IN THE LID.

14:05.521 --> 14:06.689
WHO FOUND IT?

14:06.689 --> 14:08.090
I DID.

14:08.090 --> 14:10.526
WHAT DID T.J. SAY
WHEN HE REALIZED IT WAS GONE?

14:10.526 --> 14:11.861
NOTHING.

14:11.861 --> 14:13.696
HE DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS GONE.

14:13.696 --> 14:15.364
HE NEVER
KNEW IT WAS THERE.

14:15.364 --> 14:16.766
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

14:16.766 --> 14:18.234
BECAUSE I TOOK IT OUT.

14:18.234 --> 14:20.903
I SHOWED HIM THE TRUNK LID
WITH THE GUN GONE.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.572
HE HAD NO IDEA.

14:22.572 --> 14:24.407
THAT IS THE TRUTH.

14:24.407 --> 14:29.245
WHOEVER PUT THAT GUN
IN THAT CAR -- IT WAS NOT T.J.

14:29.245 --> 14:32.281
I'LL BE BACK.

14:32.281 --> 14:37.386
WE'RE A LONG WAY
FROM ME OFFERING YOU A BEER.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.997
DUDE, WE NEED TO HAVE
A SERIOUS TALK.

14:54.909 --> 14:56.244
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT TEENAGERS?

14:56.244 --> 14:59.980
THEY LIKE TO RIDE
SKATEBOARDS.

14:59.980 --> 15:03.217
THEY HAVE A LOT OF SEX.
THEY PLAY WITH THEIR PHONES.

15:03.217 --> 15:05.719
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT VIC, RIGHT?

15:05.719 --> 15:08.322
YEAH.

15:08.322 --> 15:09.990
DID HE SAY
WHY HE DID IT?

15:09.990 --> 15:13.894
HE'S NOT A GREAT COMMUNICATOR
RIGHT NOW.

15:13.894 --> 15:15.896
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.

15:15.896 --> 15:19.133
HE'S A KID.
KIDS HAVE PROBLEMS.

15:19.133 --> 15:22.970
WHAT WERE
YOUR KID PROBLEMS?

15:22.970 --> 15:24.505
MATT McLYCHOK.

15:24.505 --> 15:27.174
HE TRIPPED ME WHEN I WAS
ON CRUTCHES IN SEVENTH GRADE.

15:28.509 --> 15:30.344
THAT AND GIRLS.
GIRLS WERE A PROBLEM, TOO.

15:30.344 --> 15:32.012
OH, YEAH? TOO MANY?
YEAH.

15:32.012 --> 15:34.581
NO -- WELL,
IT CAN GET COMPLICATED.

15:36.483 --> 15:39.653
WHAT THE HELL?

15:39.653 --> 15:40.888
LICENSE
AND REGISTRATION.

15:40.888 --> 15:43.057
AND WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
OFFICER?

15:43.057 --> 15:46.026
PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS YOU
LEANING OVER AND TALKING TO ME.

15:46.026 --> 15:47.695
LICENSE
AND REGISTRATION.

15:47.695 --> 15:49.430
OKAY.

15:55.736 --> 15:58.405
ABOUT A HALF-MILE BACK,
YOU MADE AN ILLEGAL LEFT TURN.

15:58.405 --> 16:01.075
WHAT?
NO, WE DIDN'T.

16:01.075 --> 16:02.543
MA'AM,
THERE WAS A SIGN.

16:02.543 --> 16:04.611
NOW, SIT BACK IN YOUR SEAT
AND STOP YELLING.

16:04.611 --> 16:07.014
YELLING?
I WA-- I WASN'T YELLING!

16:07.014 --> 16:08.849
I<i> CAN</i> YELL
IF YOU WANT ME TO!

16:08.849 --> 16:10.584
LET ME -- LET ME JUST --
JERK.

16:10.584 --> 16:11.752
SIR --

16:11.752 --> 16:12.953
HEY.

16:12.953 --> 16:15.255
OH, MY GOD.

16:16.924 --> 16:19.026
DO NOT MAKE A MOVE.

16:19.026 --> 16:21.362
OFFICER --
AND YOU -- NOT A SOUND.

16:28.135 --> 16:33.507
JUST GIVE US
A SECOND THERE, MA'AM.

16:51.925 --> 16:54.094
CAN WE GO ON A DATE?

16:54.094 --> 16:55.262
The two of us?

16:55.262 --> 16:57.364
WELL, UNLESS
QUINCY THERINGER SHOWS UP,

16:57.364 --> 16:58.799
YES,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

16:58.799 --> 17:00.901
I'D LIKE THAT.

17:00.901 --> 17:03.270
TONIGHT, 7:30,
GRAND AVENUE BRIDGE.

17:03.270 --> 17:04.772
IT'S A DATE.

17:04.772 --> 17:06.640
YES, IT IS.

17:10.778 --> 17:12.446
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR GIRL.

17:12.446 --> 17:15.816
BUT YOU GOT TO TELL ME, BOSS,
RIGHT NOW, STRAIGHT UP,

17:15.816 --> 17:17.518
HOW DID THAT GUN
GET IN YOUR CAR?

17:17.518 --> 17:19.019
THAT WASN'T MY GUN,
RODNEY.

17:19.019 --> 17:20.687
I GOT THAT.

17:20.687 --> 17:21.855
HOW DID IT GET
IN YOUR CAR?

17:21.855 --> 17:23.090
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
IT WAS IN MY CAR.

17:23.090 --> 17:25.759
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
BROTHER.

17:25.759 --> 17:27.428
I KNOW
WHO PUT IT THERE.

17:27.428 --> 17:30.097
OKAY. GOOD. WHO?

17:30.097 --> 17:31.765
IT WASN'T ME.

17:39.473 --> 17:43.477
WHO WAS IT?

17:43.477 --> 17:45.679
THE PERSON
WHO KILLED LOU.

17:45.679 --> 17:47.147
YOU KNOW WHO THAT WAS?

17:51.151 --> 17:54.154
Y-YOU CALL ME OVER HERE
ABOUT JAYWALKING?

17:54.154 --> 17:55.989
THIS IS CHICAGO.

17:55.989 --> 17:59.993
IT WAS THROUGH TRAFFIC.
HE'S NOT HIMSELF.

17:59.993 --> 18:02.162
WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T TALK TO ME.

18:02.162 --> 18:03.497
NEITHER DOES VAL.

18:03.497 --> 18:06.567
REALLY, JACK?

18:06.567 --> 18:09.336
FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF?

18:10.904 --> 18:12.906
ARE YOU OKAY?
I'M FINE.

18:12.906 --> 18:14.374
ELAINE.

18:14.374 --> 18:17.377
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A THING WITH AIDAN

18:17.377 --> 18:18.679
AT THE --
YOU KNOW, THE WINE --

18:18.679 --> 18:19.980
YEAH,
I KNOW WHO AIDAN IS.

18:19.980 --> 18:22.316
WELL, THAT MAKES ONE OF US.
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

18:22.316 --> 18:24.818
WE HAD THIS THING
WITH A COP.

18:24.818 --> 18:25.953
WITH A COP?

18:25.953 --> 18:29.556
YEAH, HE PULLED US OVER,
AND HE WAS A TOTAL JERK.

18:29.556 --> 18:31.291
HE THREW AIDAN
ON THE HOOD.

18:31.291 --> 18:34.027
AND THEN JUST LIKE THAT,
HE WALKS AWAY SMILING.

18:34.027 --> 18:36.930
NO TICKET. NOTHING.
I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS WEIRD.

18:36.930 --> 18:40.100
HMM.
I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.502
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO CHECK IT OUT.

18:41.502 --> 18:43.403
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
IS TALK TO OUR SON.

18:43.403 --> 18:44.872
THAT'S WHAT
I WANT YOU TO DO.

18:44.872 --> 18:46.707
I'LL TRY.

18:46.707 --> 18:48.709
I'M TRYING.

18:53.046 --> 18:55.215
I'M BUSY.

18:55.215 --> 18:58.085
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THE MROZEK CASE.
COINKIDINK.

18:58.085 --> 19:00.587
BECAUSE I DO<i> NOT</i> WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THE MROZEK CASE.

19:00.587 --> 19:02.256
BECAUSE I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE MROZEK CASE.

19:02.256 --> 19:05.259
AND EVEN IF I DID CARE ABOUT
THE MROZEK CASE, WHICH I DO NOT,

19:05.259 --> 19:07.261
I DON'T HAVE ANY JURISDICTION
OVER THE MROZEK CASE,

19:07.261 --> 19:09.263
SO THERE WOULDN'T
BE ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

19:09.263 --> 19:11.431
DO YOU STILL WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THE MROZEK CASE?

19:11.431 --> 19:12.466
YES.

19:13.634 --> 19:15.802
I THINK YOU MIGHT THINK
I'M A THERAPIST.

19:15.802 --> 19:17.804
I AM NOT A THERAPIST.

19:17.804 --> 19:19.439
BUT THERAPY
COULD BE GOOD FOR YOU.

19:19.439 --> 19:20.774
I NEED YOUR ADVICE.

19:20.774 --> 19:22.276
I HAVE A SUSPECT,
SOME EVIDENCE.

19:22.276 --> 19:23.443
THE PERSON WHO TOLD ME
ABOUT THE SUSPECT,

19:23.443 --> 19:25.279
THE PERSON
WHO GAVE ME SAID EVIDENCE --

19:25.279 --> 19:26.747
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

19:26.747 --> 19:28.081
HOW WOULD YOU PROCEED
IF YOU WERE ME?

19:28.081 --> 19:29.082
I WOULDN'T.

19:29.082 --> 19:30.751
WELL, WHAT IF
YOU REALLY WANTED TO?

19:30.751 --> 19:33.654
THEN I WOULD ASK MYSELF
<i>WHY</i> I REALLY WANTED TO.

19:33.654 --> 19:36.223
PLEASE, JUST HELP ME OUT HERE,
WILL YOU?

19:39.760 --> 19:44.765
HOW DO I TEST INFORMATION
PROVIDED BY A KNOWN LIAR?

19:46.667 --> 19:50.003
HONESTLY, I'D MAKE SURE
THE WITNESSES WERE GOOD, DREW.

19:50.003 --> 19:53.974
IT'S ALWAYS
ABOUT THE WITNESSES.

19:53.974 --> 19:56.410
THERE ARE WITNESSES,
RIGHT?

20:10.791 --> 20:12.459
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

20:12.459 --> 20:15.596
THANK YOU.
SORRY I'M LATE.

20:15.596 --> 20:17.464
HOW'S THE STUDIO?

20:17.464 --> 20:20.500
SOGGY. I BROKE DOWN
AND CALLED MY LANDLORD.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.935
AND?

20:21.935 --> 20:24.104
HE TOLD ME
TO CALL MY LAWYER.

20:25.239 --> 20:28.275
I WAS THINKING
WE COULD GET SOME DINNER.

20:28.275 --> 20:31.878
WHAT? I-IS THERE A FOOD TRUCK
COMING BY?

20:31.878 --> 20:35.048
OVER HERE.

20:35.048 --> 20:36.049
TRUST ME.

20:51.865 --> 20:53.367
ARE WE SQUATTING?

20:53.367 --> 20:55.035
'CAUSE I JUST DID A STORY
ON THIS,

20:55.035 --> 20:56.536
AND IT DOESN'T END WELL.

20:56.536 --> 20:58.038
WE'RE NOT SQUATTING.

21:03.510 --> 21:05.012
WHOSE HOUSE IS THIS?

21:06.647 --> 21:08.148
OURS.

21:26.739 --> 21:27.940
FRANK PERKINS?

21:27.940 --> 21:29.976
MATTHEW HENDRICKS.

21:29.976 --> 21:32.378
I WAS TOLD
IT WAS FRANK PERKINS.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.046
THAT WAS A FAKE NAME.

21:34.046 --> 21:36.716
WE'RE NOT
OFF TO A GREAT START.

21:36.716 --> 21:38.651
MATTHEW HENDRICKS
IS MY REAL NAME.

21:38.651 --> 21:42.989
WELL, MY REAL NAME
IS DREW STAFFORD.

21:42.989 --> 21:45.992
I'M AN ASSISTANT
STATE'S ATTORNEY.

21:45.992 --> 21:48.160
THATCHER KARSTEN
TELLS ME THAT YOU MAY HAVE

21:48.160 --> 21:51.664
SOME INFORMATION
ABOUT THE MURDER OF LOU MROZEK.

21:55.434 --> 21:59.105
WE NEED SOME CURTAINS.

21:59.105 --> 22:01.908
YEAH.
AND A REFRIGERATOR.

22:01.908 --> 22:03.643
WE DON'T HAVE
A REFRIGERATOR?

22:03.643 --> 22:05.645
OR A TOASTER.
OR HEATING.

22:05.645 --> 22:06.979
OR A BED.

22:06.979 --> 22:08.281
BUT THE PLUMBING
IS AMAZING.

22:11.784 --> 22:13.686
I REMEMBER
WHEN YOU SAID

22:13.686 --> 22:16.222
THAT YOU WANTED A PLACE
OVERLOOKING THE RIVER.

22:18.124 --> 22:23.629
IT'S EXACTLY
LIKE I PICTURED IT.

22:23.629 --> 22:25.598
WELL, YOU DID ACTUALLY
SHOW ME A PICTURE.

22:28.601 --> 22:32.271
SARA, I KNOW
THIS WAS...PRESUMPTUOUS.

22:32.271 --> 22:34.140
JACK.
IT'S A LEASE, THOUGH.

22:34.140 --> 22:35.474
SO, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT --

22:35.474 --> 22:37.777
I LOVE IT.
I LOVE IT.

22:37.777 --> 22:40.780
I LOVE THAT WE HAVE
SOMETHING OF OURS.

22:58.631 --> 23:00.299
THANKS.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.471
LOU AND I WERE PARTNERS
IN A COMPANY CALLED

23:05.471 --> 23:07.506
MULTINATIONAL
BUILDERS CORP.

23:07.506 --> 23:09.675
IT WAS A FLYER, REALLY --
SOMETHING WE SET UP

23:09.675 --> 23:11.010
JUST IN CASE WE LANDED

23:11.010 --> 23:13.980
SOME SPIN-OFF KARSTEN ALLIED
DEVELOPMENT, OKAY?

23:13.980 --> 23:16.315
SO, ANYWAY, ONE DAY,
JACK APPROACHES ME.

23:16.315 --> 23:18.317
HE SAYS HE WANTS TO
USE THE COMPANY

23:18.317 --> 23:20.987
FOR SOME "TRANSACTIONAL FUNDING"
FOR A NEW PROJECT.

23:20.987 --> 23:23.022
LET'S CUT TO IT,
FRANK.

23:23.022 --> 23:25.024
OR MATTHEW OR WHATEVER THE HELL
YOUR NAME IS.

23:25.024 --> 23:27.593
MATTHEW.
MATTHEW. GREAT.

23:27.593 --> 23:28.928
LOOK,
JACK WAS EMBEZZLING.

23:28.928 --> 23:30.596
HE WAS ROUTING MONEY
OUT OF KARSTEN ALLIED

23:30.596 --> 23:33.065
THROUGH YOUR COMPANY --
IS THAT RIGHT?

23:33.065 --> 23:38.371
I-I WAS NOT TOTALLY AWARE
OF THAT AT THE TIME, BUT YES.

23:38.371 --> 23:41.040
OKAY, LOOK,
I KEPT MY HEAD DOWN, OKAY?

23:41.040 --> 23:42.241
I ADMIT THAT.

23:42.241 --> 23:43.242
BUT I HAVE A FAMILY.

23:43.242 --> 23:44.577
SOMEBODY
FROM KARSTEN ALLIED

23:44.577 --> 23:47.013
EVENTUALLY CAUGHT ON
TO THE MISSING MONEY.

23:47.013 --> 23:48.247
JACK PINNED IT ON LOU.

23:48.247 --> 23:50.916
LOU'S NAME BEING ON THE COMPANY
LOOKED PRETTY BAD.

23:50.916 --> 23:52.752
SO LOU PANICKED.
HE WENT TO THE FEDS.

23:52.752 --> 23:54.420
JACK GOT TO HIM BEFORE
HE COULD TALK AND KILLED HIM.

23:54.420 --> 23:57.356
AM I MISSING ANYTHING?

23:57.356 --> 23:59.959
YEAH,
LOU'S WIFE, CONNIE.

23:59.959 --> 24:01.594
CONNIE MROZEK.
WHAT ABOUT HER?

24:01.594 --> 24:03.863
JACK WANTED TO
KILL HER, TOO.

24:03.863 --> 24:07.733
WELL, SHE KNEW ABOUT THE MONEY.
SHE KNEW JACK KILLED LOU.

24:07.733 --> 24:09.368
I HELPED HER ESCAPE.

24:09.368 --> 24:11.103
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE IS RIGHT NOW?

24:12.938 --> 24:15.775
YOU HAVE A CHECKERED PAST,
MR. HENDRICKS --

24:15.775 --> 24:17.276
FAILED BUSINESSES,
MULTIPLE ALIASES,

24:17.276 --> 24:18.944
QUESTIONABLE ASSOCIATIONS.

24:18.944 --> 24:22.448
I'M INCLINED NOT TO BELIEVE YOU
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

24:22.448 --> 24:25.584
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A DEAD MAN
HERE, MR. STAFFORD.

24:25.584 --> 24:27.053
NOW, SAY WHAT YOU WILL
ABOUT ME,

24:27.053 --> 24:29.088
BUT I'VE NEVER COME CLOSE
TO THAT KIND OF THING,

24:29.088 --> 24:32.324
AND I AM SCARED, MAN.
I AM SCARED OF JACK.

24:32.324 --> 24:33.793
I'VE BEEN IN HIDING
EVER SINCE

24:33.793 --> 24:36.095
HE CAME LOOKING FOR ME
A FEW DAYS AFTER HE SHOT LOU.

24:36.095 --> 24:40.833
SO YOU CAN BELIEVE ME,
OR I CAN DISAPPEAR AGAIN.

24:43.602 --> 24:47.273
THIS IS A DONUT
THE SIZE OF SOUTH DAKOTA.

24:49.442 --> 24:51.277
OH, I WISH
I COULD STAY HERE ALL DAY.

24:51.277 --> 24:54.080
I'M GOING TO
STAY HERE ALL DAY.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.514
THANKS.

24:55.514 --> 24:59.085
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT
TO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO NOW?

24:59.085 --> 25:01.253
OH, NO.

25:01.253 --> 25:03.756
AM I ALREADY THE SLACKER GUY
HANGING AROUND THE HOUSE?

25:03.756 --> 25:05.357
STOP.

25:05.357 --> 25:07.526
I'M SERIOUS.

25:07.526 --> 25:09.195
NATE GAVE ME
SOME HOMEWORK.

25:09.195 --> 25:14.467
OTHER THAN THAT...
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

25:14.467 --> 25:18.871
YOU MUST HAVE HAD OTHER CAREER
IDEAS WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG.

25:18.871 --> 25:20.539
WHAT DID
YOU WANT TO BE?

25:20.539 --> 25:22.808
SPIDER-MAN.

25:22.808 --> 25:25.377
TRICKY.

25:25.377 --> 25:27.980
WE'LL NEED TO
WORK ON THIS.

25:33.819 --> 25:37.223
YEAH. DID YOU
TURN UP ANYTHING ON HIM?

25:39.792 --> 25:42.628
NO. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.296
THANKS.

25:57.409 --> 25:58.410
HEY.

25:58.410 --> 25:59.578
Hey.

25:59.578 --> 26:00.679
DO YOU HAVE
A FEW MINUTES?

26:00.679 --> 26:02.148
I NEED TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

26:04.817 --> 26:07.486
HI.

26:07.486 --> 26:09.488
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:09.488 --> 26:12.158
OH, A PIPE BURST.
I THINK I MIGHT BE MOVING.

26:12.158 --> 26:14.827
REALLY? WHERE TO?

26:14.827 --> 26:16.829
OH, SOMEWHERE
WITH BETTER PLUMBING.

26:16.829 --> 26:18.664
HERE. COME SIT DOWN.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.332
YEAH.

26:24.203 --> 26:27.173
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU CAME.

26:27.173 --> 26:30.009
I AM, TOO.

26:30.009 --> 26:31.911
ALL RIGHT.

26:33.012 --> 26:34.380
RIGHT HERE?
MM-HMM.

26:35.781 --> 26:37.917
OKAY.
RIGHT.

26:37.917 --> 26:40.085
ALL RIGHT.

26:43.355 --> 26:44.957
DO I LOOK LIKE
I'M RISING.

26:44.957 --> 26:47.526
YOU ARE.

26:47.526 --> 26:49.929
AND OLIVER IS SO PROUD.

26:49.929 --> 26:53.132
HAVING HIS DAD OUT THERE,
CATCHING ALL THE BAD GUYS.

26:53.132 --> 26:54.733
I'M RISING.

26:54.733 --> 26:57.203
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

27:02.041 --> 27:04.877
GREAT.

27:12.051 --> 27:14.053
SARA...

27:15.721 --> 27:18.424
...I THINK JACK
MIGHT BE ONE OF THE BAD GUYS.

27:20.392 --> 27:22.061
DREW, NO.
I'M SERIOUS.
I'M WORRIED FOR YOU.

27:22.061 --> 27:24.630
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
I'M WORRIED FOR YOU.

27:24.630 --> 27:25.965
YOU'RE WORRIED?
SARA, PLEASE.

27:25.965 --> 27:27.433
JUST PLEASE JUST LISTEN.
DREW, COME ON, NOW.

27:27.433 --> 27:29.501
I THINK JACK
MIGHT HAVE KILLED LOU MROZEK.

27:29.501 --> 27:30.936
WHAT?!

27:30.936 --> 27:34.473
LOOK, JUST STOP FOR ONE SECOND
AND LISTEN TO ME.

27:34.473 --> 27:36.408
THERE IS EVIDENCE.

27:36.408 --> 27:38.744
THE COINCIDENCE
OF THIS WHOLE THING --

27:38.744 --> 27:41.480
JACK MIRACULOUSLY SHOWS UP
IN YOUR LIFE

27:41.480 --> 27:43.415
RIGHT WHEN I'M CLOSING IN
ON THE KARSTENS,

27:43.415 --> 27:46.252
RIGHT WHEN
LOU GOES TO THE FBI,

27:46.252 --> 27:47.786
AND RIGHT
WHEN LOU GETS KILLED.

27:47.786 --> 27:49.288
THINK ABOUT IT.

27:49.288 --> 27:52.124
IT MAKES NO SENSE.

27:52.124 --> 27:53.525
IT NEVER HAS.

28:07.619 --> 28:10.288
HEY.
I BOUGHT A TOASTER.

28:10.288 --> 28:11.723
THE POP-UP KIND,
NOT THE ONE WITH A DOOR.

28:11.723 --> 28:13.692
I LIKE
THE BREAD POPPING UP.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.161
HEY, CAN YOU HAND ME
THAT SCREWDRIVER?

28:16.161 --> 28:20.031
THANK YOU.

28:27.405 --> 28:30.842
DID YOU SEE ME AT THAT PARTY
BEFORE THE BALCONY?

28:30.842 --> 28:32.343
THE BALCONY?

28:32.343 --> 28:34.679
THE NIGHT WE MET.

28:34.679 --> 28:36.815
UH, YOU WERE
WEARING A RED DRESS.

28:36.815 --> 28:39.084
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE ME.

28:39.084 --> 28:42.854
UH, NO.
I DON'T THINK I SAW YOU.

28:42.854 --> 28:43.922
WHY?

28:43.922 --> 28:48.026
SO IF I HADN'T
COME OUT ON THE BALCONY...

28:49.127 --> 28:50.128
YOU OKAY?

28:51.596 --> 28:53.765
YOU WANTED THE TOASTER
WITH THE DOOR, DIDN'T YOU?

28:57.936 --> 29:00.271
OH, I SAW DREW
THIS MORNING.

29:00.271 --> 29:01.606
HE CAME BY THE STUDIO.

29:01.606 --> 29:03.608
REALLY? WHY?

29:03.608 --> 29:06.277
HE'S VERY INTO
THE MROZEK CASE AGAIN.

29:06.277 --> 29:07.812
THE MROZEK CASE?

29:07.812 --> 29:09.981
HE DOESN'T THINK
T.J. DID IT.

29:09.981 --> 29:11.483
WELL, HE DIDN'T.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.985
BUT WHY IS HE
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THIS?

29:13.985 --> 29:16.688
THAT'S TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.
I MEAN, THE CASE IS CLOSED.

29:16.688 --> 29:17.889
WHO DO YOU THINK DID IT?

29:17.889 --> 29:19.657
WHO DO I THINK
KILLED LOU MROZEK?

29:19.657 --> 29:21.493
I HAVE NO IDEA, SARA.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.328
THAT KID LIL' D, I GUESS.

29:23.328 --> 29:24.496
NOT T.J.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.197
BUT WHY ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT THIS?

29:26.197 --> 29:27.899
I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

29:27.899 --> 29:29.601
ABOUT LOU MROZEK?

29:31.836 --> 29:35.774
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THAT. IS THAT OKAY?

29:40.678 --> 29:45.016
VIC'S AGREED TO SEE ME.
I SHOULD GO.

29:54.893 --> 29:55.894
YO.

29:55.894 --> 29:57.896
YO.

29:57.896 --> 29:59.264
THANKS FOR COMING.

29:59.264 --> 30:01.933
NEW MENU, HOT CHEF.
I WOULDN'T MISS IT.

30:01.933 --> 30:05.603
SO, WHO CAN I
TALK TO ABOUT GETTING --

30:05.603 --> 30:07.438
OH, I DON'T KNOW --
THAT TABLE BY THE WINDOW?

30:07.438 --> 30:09.440
WELL, THAT IS
A TABLE FOR TWO.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.376
AND, UH,
THERE'S THREE OF US.

30:11.376 --> 30:12.710
THREE?
MM-HMM.

30:12.710 --> 30:14.579
OH, IS IT
THE SEAFOOD GUY?

30:14.579 --> 30:15.747
IT'S NOT
THE SEAFOOD GUY, IS IT?

30:15.747 --> 30:18.049
NO. IT'S MY DAD.

30:18.049 --> 30:19.818
YOU, ME, AND MY DAD.

30:21.019 --> 30:25.390
COME ON.
IT'LL BE FUN.

30:58.156 --> 30:59.824
SAUVIGNON BLANC --

30:59.824 --> 31:02.827
ZESTY WITH HINTS
OF PEACH AND WET STONE.

31:02.827 --> 31:05.096
STOP WITH THE GIBBERISH.

31:05.096 --> 31:06.998
IT'S NOT GIBBERISH.

31:06.998 --> 31:09.634
WET STONE?

31:09.634 --> 31:15.139
DAD, AIDAN WANTS TO
ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS.

31:15.139 --> 31:16.307
I DO?
WHAT QUESTIONS?

31:16.307 --> 31:17.342
I THOUGHT SO.

31:17.342 --> 31:19.444
ABOUT WHAT?

31:19.444 --> 31:20.778
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS.
ABOUT HIS BUSINESS?

31:20.778 --> 31:22.080
WHAT
ABOUT MY BUSINESS?

31:23.581 --> 31:24.916
YEAH, THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HERE, RIGHT?

31:24.916 --> 31:28.119
NO, YOU INVITED ME
TO LUNCH.

31:28.119 --> 31:30.355
I'M ENJOYING THE WINE.
THANK YOU.

31:31.356 --> 31:32.390
IT'S SO FUNNY,
BECAUSE AIDAN'S

31:32.390 --> 31:35.360
JUST PRETENDING
TO BE A WINE SALESMAN.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.694
REALLY? WHY?

31:38.329 --> 31:40.331
NO, SHE'S KIDDING.

31:40.331 --> 31:42.100
I'M NOT KIDDING.

31:46.004 --> 31:49.340
DO YOU COLLECT WINE,
MR. KARSTEN?

31:49.340 --> 31:52.110
WHY ARE YOU PRETENDING
TO BE A WINE SALESMAN?

31:53.711 --> 31:56.714
WELL, GO AHEAD.
YOU CAN TELL HIM.

31:56.714 --> 32:00.285
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO HIDE, DO YOU?

32:05.056 --> 32:08.393
OH, I'M SORRY, LAINIE.

32:08.393 --> 32:10.728
I'VE GOT TO GO.
OKAY.

32:10.728 --> 32:12.997
THANKS FOR THE LUNCH.

32:12.997 --> 32:17.669
YOU BETTER
ANSWER HER QUESTION.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.015
HEY.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.784
I'M DOING THIS FOR MOM.

32:36.321 --> 32:38.156
HEY.
YOU FEELING BETTER?

32:38.156 --> 32:39.324
YEAH.

32:39.324 --> 32:41.025
I'M GOING OUT
WITH VIC FOR A BIT.

32:41.025 --> 32:43.061
MAYBE WHEN I COME BACK,
WE COULD CATCH UP.

32:43.061 --> 32:44.929
YEAH,
THAT SOUNDS GREAT, DAD.

32:44.929 --> 32:45.930
ALL RIGHT.

32:45.930 --> 32:48.499
WAIT. JACK.

32:48.499 --> 32:49.934
HEY, CAN I
TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC?

32:49.934 --> 32:51.402
SURE.
WHEN I COME BACK.

32:51.402 --> 32:53.237
I GOT A CALL
FROM THE FBI.

32:53.237 --> 32:54.372
THE FBI?

32:54.372 --> 32:56.941
ABOUT KARSTEN.
QUINCY SOMETHING-OR-OTHER.

32:56.941 --> 32:57.942
OKAY.

32:57.942 --> 32:59.077
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

32:59.077 --> 33:00.545
THAT'S OKAY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

33:00.545 --> 33:03.081
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU
ASKED ME TO DESTROY DOCUMENTS?

33:03.081 --> 33:04.682
THAT WAS A GOOD THING.
TRUST ME.

33:04.682 --> 33:05.717
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

33:05.717 --> 33:06.884
THERE IS A PROBLEM.

33:06.884 --> 33:08.119
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

33:08.119 --> 33:10.421
THE PROBLEM IS
I DIDN'T DESTROY THE DOCUMENTS.

33:10.421 --> 33:11.923
I KEPT A COPY.

33:11.923 --> 33:14.058
WHERE ARE THEY?

33:14.058 --> 33:15.360
I THINK THEY'RE SAFE.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.662
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING TO HER,
QUINCY THERINGER?

33:17.662 --> 33:18.796
NO.

33:18.796 --> 33:21.799
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL TALK WHEN I GET BACK.

33:21.799 --> 33:23.634
YOU AND ME -- WE'LL FIGURE
THIS OUT, ALL RIGHT?

33:23.634 --> 33:25.670
OKAY.

33:27.872 --> 33:31.542
WHY WOULD JACK
SET UP T.J.?

33:31.542 --> 33:34.045
OH, THERE'S
A HISTORY THERE.

33:34.045 --> 33:35.947
A LONG HISTORY.

33:35.947 --> 33:38.316
JEALOUSY, BITTERNESS.

33:38.316 --> 33:40.084
T.J. IS MY SON.

33:40.084 --> 33:42.920
JACK WAS ALWAYS
ENVIOUS OF THAT.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.989
HE DEFENDED HIM,
THOUGH.

33:44.989 --> 33:46.290
HE HAD NO CHOICE.

33:46.290 --> 33:49.560
ANYWAY, THAT'S JACK --
PLAYING ALL THE ANGLES.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.463
FRAME HIM,
THEN GET HIM OFF.

33:52.463 --> 33:54.265
ACT LIKE THE HERO.

33:57.168 --> 33:58.336
LOOK,
I'M GONNA NEED MORE.

33:58.336 --> 34:00.671
I'M GONNA NEED MORE RECORDS,
MORE WITNESSES.

34:00.671 --> 34:02.507
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

34:02.507 --> 34:03.941
YOU MAY
HAVE TO TESTIFY.

34:03.941 --> 34:06.044
OF COURSE.

34:07.645 --> 34:09.480
I'M GONNA NEED IMMUNITY.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.983
BROAD IMMUNITY.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.284
IS THAT
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

34:13.284 --> 34:18.122
I'M EXPOSED HERE ALREADY.
I NEED SOME PROTECTION.

34:18.122 --> 34:19.424
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT.

34:19.424 --> 34:21.559
I'M NOT GONNA IMMUNIZE
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE FOR THIS.

34:23.127 --> 34:25.963
YOU NEED TO THINK
VERY CAREFULLY, MR. STAFFORD,

34:25.963 --> 34:28.800
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO PROCEED.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.468
YOU HAVE
A REAL OPPORTUNITY

34:30.468 --> 34:33.971
TO RECLAIM YOUR LIFE,
YOUR CAREER,

34:33.971 --> 34:35.640
TO RECOVER YOUR REPUTATION
ON THE VERY CASE

34:35.640 --> 34:39.777
THAT BROUGHT YOU
CONSIDERABLE DISREPUTE.

34:39.777 --> 34:43.614
VERSUS WHAT?

34:43.614 --> 34:46.584
A BIRD IN THE HAND,
MR. STAFFORD?

35:24.021 --> 35:27.024
I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU FOR A WHILE, VIC.

35:27.024 --> 35:29.193
I WAS HOPING
WE COULD TALK.

35:29.193 --> 35:30.995
ABOUT WHAT?

35:30.995 --> 35:34.832
ANYTHING.
HOW'S SCHOOL?

35:34.832 --> 35:37.668
FINE.

35:37.668 --> 35:39.670
ANY MORE MEETS
THIS FALL?

35:39.670 --> 35:41.439
I'M NOT WRESTLING.

35:41.439 --> 35:43.674
YOU KNOW, I COULD SEND YOU
AN E-MAIL OF MY SCHEDULE,

35:43.674 --> 35:44.742
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

35:44.742 --> 35:47.311
IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.080
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

35:49.080 --> 35:52.683
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
MY DAD WAS DEAD.

35:52.683 --> 35:54.519
LUCKY YOU.

35:54.519 --> 35:56.120
THAT'S ENOUGH!

35:56.120 --> 35:58.689
I DON'T
DESERVE THIS FROM YOU!

36:02.026 --> 36:05.863
VIC, I-I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

36:07.865 --> 36:10.201
LOOK, I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT I DID TO YOUR MOM.

36:10.201 --> 36:14.372
I'M SORRY
I'M NOT AT HOME ANYMORE.

36:14.372 --> 36:16.874
I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING.

36:16.874 --> 36:18.876
I JUST WANT TO BE
YOUR DAD.

36:18.876 --> 36:20.778
PLEASE.

36:20.778 --> 36:24.115
JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU.

36:24.115 --> 36:25.216
PLEASE.

36:30.288 --> 36:32.957
I KNOW
WHO KILLED UNCLE LOU.

36:32.957 --> 36:35.293
WHAT?

36:35.293 --> 36:38.863
AND I THINK YOU DO,
TOO, DAD.

36:43.098 --> 36:45.601
BYE. THANKS FOR COMING.

36:53.658 --> 36:54.993
CAN I JUST SAY --

36:54.993 --> 36:56.900
NO, NO. I'M TALKING.

36:56.900 --> 37:00.203
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
MY DAD'S BUSINESS OR JACK'S,

37:00.203 --> 37:03.113
SO WHATEVER TIME THAT YOU
SPENT HERE OR IN MY HOUSE,

37:03.113 --> 37:06.617
SNIFFING AROUND LIKE A LITTLE
FBI RODENT WAS ALL A WASTE.

37:06.617 --> 37:07.685
IT WAS MY JOB.

37:07.685 --> 37:10.712
YOUR JOB WAS TO
HAVE SEX WITH ME?

37:10.712 --> 37:12.181
SO YOU'RE A PROSTITUTE.

37:12.181 --> 37:13.515
NO. I --

37:13.515 --> 37:16.018
SO IF THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB,
THEN YOU SUCK AT YOUR JOB.

37:16.018 --> 37:18.442
YOU SUCK AT YOUR REAL JOB
AND YOUR FAKE JOB.

37:18.442 --> 37:19.843
YOU SUCK.

37:19.843 --> 37:21.345
YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T CARE WHO I WAS.

37:21.345 --> 37:24.014
THAT WAS BEFORE I KNEW
THAT YOU WERE A TOTAL DICK,

37:24.014 --> 37:25.916
AND I WANT YOU
TO TAKE OFFENSE AT THAT.

37:30.254 --> 37:33.090
I REALLY DO LIKE YOU,
ELAINE.

37:33.090 --> 37:34.959
WELL,
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

37:43.801 --> 37:46.704
THEY'RE LOOKING
INTO THE MROZEK MURDER AGAIN.

37:46.704 --> 37:48.539
IT'S SOMEONE
IN YOUR FAMILY.

37:48.539 --> 37:51.108
THOUGHT THAT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

37:56.046 --> 37:59.216
YOU OKAY?
YEAH, I'M FINE.

37:59.216 --> 38:01.819
THANK YOU
FOR TELLING ME ABOUT HIM.

38:01.819 --> 38:05.456
YOU TALKED TO THE KIDS,
TOLD THEM TO REACH OUT TO ME.

38:05.456 --> 38:07.658
YOU'RE THEIR FATHER.

38:07.658 --> 38:10.194
I APPRECIATE IT.

38:10.194 --> 38:12.630
LOOK,
I JUST LEFT VIC AT HOME.

38:12.630 --> 38:14.698
YOU NEED TO GO THERE NOW.

38:14.698 --> 38:16.133
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

38:16.133 --> 38:18.402
I HAVE TO GO.
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

38:45.162 --> 38:47.998
HEY.

39:04.748 --> 39:06.417
GOOD BOY.

39:06.417 --> 39:07.918
THANKS
FOR MEETING ME.

39:07.918 --> 39:08.919
WHO ARE YOU?

39:08.919 --> 39:11.255
QUINCY THERINGER,
FBI.

39:11.255 --> 39:13.424
I'M NOT MEETING YOU.

39:13.424 --> 39:15.092
YOU JUST SHOWED UP HERE.

39:15.092 --> 39:16.927
OH, YES. THAT'S RIGHT.
I DID.

39:16.927 --> 39:19.930
ANYWAY, THIS COULD BE
A PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP.

39:19.930 --> 39:21.432
I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP.

39:21.432 --> 39:24.068
YOU HELP ME WITH KARSTEN,
I HELP YOU WITH THE IRS.

39:24.068 --> 39:25.769
I DON'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE IRS.

39:25.769 --> 39:27.304
AND I CAN'T HELP YOU
WITH KARSTEN.

39:27.304 --> 39:29.773
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
INCRIMINATING AGAINST KARSTEN?

39:29.773 --> 39:31.108
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

39:31.108 --> 39:32.776
YOU'RE NOT HIDING ANYTHING.
NO.

39:32.776 --> 39:33.777
DOCUMENTS?
NO.

39:33.777 --> 39:35.479
WHAT IF
WE SEARCHED YOUR HOUSE?

39:35.479 --> 39:38.549
SEARCHED MY HOUSE?
NO.

39:38.549 --> 39:40.684
WELL, WE'LL FIND OUT
IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

39:44.955 --> 39:47.791
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
JACK?

39:47.791 --> 39:51.128
O-OKAY, OKAY.

39:51.128 --> 39:53.630
OKAY, I WILL.

39:53.630 --> 39:55.499
I PROMISE.

39:55.499 --> 39:57.501
OKAY, BYE.

39:57.501 --> 39:58.769
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
BOSS?

39:58.769 --> 40:00.604
CAN YOU
DRIVE ME SOMEWHERE?

40:00.604 --> 40:02.172
I GOT A SHOP
TO RUN HERE.

40:02.172 --> 40:05.008
THE PERSON I TOLD YOU
ABOUT WHO KILLED LOU --

40:05.008 --> 40:06.243
HE'S IN TROUBLE.

40:06.243 --> 40:08.846
PLEASE.

40:59.563 --> 41:02.566
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT
A FEW MONTHS AGO

41:02.566 --> 41:05.569
WHEN YOU CALLED ME ASKING
FOR HELP TO FIND THE MAGIC BOOK?

41:05.569 --> 41:06.737
WHERE'S OLIVER?

41:06.737 --> 41:09.339
HE'S AT ETHAN'S.
DO YOU REMEMBER?

41:09.339 --> 41:11.241
YEAH.

41:11.241 --> 41:13.243
THE GIRAFFE BOOK.
YOU WERE AWAY.

41:13.243 --> 41:15.179
I WAS WITH JACK.

41:15.179 --> 41:18.515
YOU WANT TO
TALK TO A DETECTIVE?

41:18.515 --> 41:19.583
YEAH.

41:19.583 --> 41:20.984
YOU WERE
WITH JACK THAT NIGHT?

41:20.984 --> 41:22.352
YES.

41:22.352 --> 41:24.822
I WAS HERE ALONE WITH OLIVER,
AND YOU WERE WITH JACK.

41:24.822 --> 41:26.690
YES.

41:31.195 --> 41:33.363
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS NOW, SARA?

41:33.363 --> 41:35.365
WHY ARE
YOU TRYING TO HURT ME?

41:35.365 --> 41:37.167
I'M TRYING TO
HELP YOU HERE.

41:37.167 --> 41:39.903
LOU MROZEK
WAS KILLED THAT NIGHT.

41:39.903 --> 41:42.239
YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

41:42.239 --> 41:43.874
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME?

41:43.874 --> 41:45.776
YES. WHY?
WHAT TIME?

41:45.776 --> 41:48.278
WHY?
HE WAS KILLED
BETWEEN 8:10 AND 8:25.

41:48.278 --> 41:52.282
YOU CALLED ME AT 8:23 ASKING
FOR HELP TO FIND THE BOOK.

41:52.282 --> 41:54.885
JACK WAS STANDING NEXT TO ME
WHEN I TALKED TO YOU.

41:54.885 --> 41:57.054
WE WERE AT DUNE ACRES,

41:57.054 --> 42:00.524
AN HOUR AWAY
FROM WHERE LOU WAS KILLED.

42:00.524 --> 42:04.695
JACK DIDN'T KILL LOU MROZEK.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

42:04.695 --> 42:08.699
MY NAME IS JACK McALLISTER.

42:08.699 --> 42:11.201
I'M HERE TO MAKE A CONFESSION.

42:14.171 --> 42:18.675
I KILLED LOU MROZEK.
