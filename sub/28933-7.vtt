00:01.131 --> 00:02.959
Previously onInstinct...

00:03.003 --> 00:06.702
I don't know how Andy managed
dating a spy, but I can't do it.

00:06.745 --> 00:08.269
We broke up last night.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.793
In my final scan, I found
a sophisticated malware bot.

00:10.836 --> 00:11.881
A malware bot?

00:11.924 --> 00:14.014
Could be targeting me
or the NYPD.

00:14.057 --> 00:16.407
To fully understand the behavior
of the Sleeping Beauty killer,

00:16.451 --> 00:17.930
I think we need to go back.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.323
The cowboy motif.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.891
The blood found on the pillow
was from a cat.

00:21.934 --> 00:25.895
What were you looking for
in my room?

00:25.938 --> 00:27.462
Who's Sleeping Beauty?Our friend here

00:27.505 --> 00:29.507
has a very popular
true crime podcast.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.074
Dennis just posted something.

00:31.118 --> 00:31.944
DENNIS [on recording]:
I have an interesting

00:31.988 --> 00:33.207
new story, one that cops

00:33.250 --> 00:34.425
don't want you to know about.

00:34.469 --> 00:35.905
Is he doing this live?

00:35.948 --> 00:37.689
DENNIS: The Sleeping Beauty
killer himself.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.082
SLEEPING BEAUTY KILLER:
Everyone at some point

00:39.126 --> 00:40.475
in their life
wants to kill someone.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.825
Then one day, I did it.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.000
Where is he?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.176
So much for controlling
the narrative.

00:47.525 --> 00:50.180
[overlapping chatter]

00:50.224 --> 00:53.096
It is my sworn duty
to protect this city,

00:53.140 --> 00:55.881
and I take that responsibility
very seriously.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.579
I share in your anger

00:57.622 --> 00:59.972
and frustration that a killer
has taken the lives

01:00.016 --> 01:02.018
of two of our citizens.Why are we just hearing

01:02.062 --> 01:04.281
about these Sleeping Beauty
murders now?

01:04.325 --> 01:06.414
Lieutenant, is this really
the work of a serial killer?

01:06.457 --> 01:08.633
DYLAN: Yes, it is.We have reason to believe

01:08.677 --> 01:10.113
that these murders were
committed by the same person...

01:10.157 --> 01:11.419
LIZZIE: I do not envy
her position.

01:11.462 --> 01:12.420
FUCCI:
With great power...

01:12.463 --> 01:14.639
This media circus
is exactly

01:14.683 --> 01:16.076
what the killer wanted
when he went

01:16.119 --> 01:17.773
on that podcast.If it was really him,

01:17.816 --> 01:19.427
which we don't
know yet.

01:19.470 --> 01:20.993
True, but either way, we have to
regain control of the narrative.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.821
But how are we
supposed to do that?

01:22.865 --> 01:24.954
We can't exactly stuff
the podcast back in the bag.

01:24.997 --> 01:27.739
Well, luckily,
the podcaster is not a cat,

01:27.783 --> 01:29.785
and I am a behavioral expert
for humans, not felines.

01:29.828 --> 01:32.266
Who said anything
about cats?

01:32.309 --> 01:35.138
You know, sex is actually
very painful for cats.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.444
Hmm.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.795
You ready?

01:39.838 --> 01:43.886
I think I'd like to do this one
on my own, if that's okay.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.235
You sure?
Yeah.

01:45.279 --> 01:48.760
If I need you,
I know where to find you.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.675
So, you want to talk about
your little interview

01:50.719 --> 01:52.373
with the Sleeping
Beauty killer?

01:52.416 --> 01:55.767
Little? It has 50,000
downloads already.

01:55.811 --> 01:56.986
You know I what I find
fascinating?

01:57.029 --> 01:58.988
Less than
48 hours ago,

01:59.031 --> 02:01.164
you sat in this very room
and you promised us

02:01.208 --> 02:03.035
that you would keep a lid
on that story.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.950
What can I say?
Circumstances changed.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.822
Yeah, I understand.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.607
I get it.

02:09.651 --> 02:13.045
But you know what
hasn't changed?

02:13.089 --> 02:14.221
Three people
are dead,

02:14.264 --> 02:15.657
two here and one in Nebraska,

02:15.700 --> 02:17.180
and we have every reason
to believe

02:17.224 --> 02:18.486
that there
will be more.

02:18.529 --> 02:21.445
You need to do what's right.And what's right?

02:21.489 --> 02:24.056
Start by telling me
how the killer contacted you.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.450
He friended me on Facebook.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.713
He fr...What do you think?

02:28.757 --> 02:30.715
He called me
from a blocked number.

02:30.759 --> 02:33.109
Did it ever occur to you while
you were chatting with this guy

02:33.153 --> 02:34.589
that we could've traced
the damn number?

02:34.632 --> 02:38.158
Look, truth is...
I didn't talk to him.

02:38.201 --> 02:42.205
He left a voicemail.
And yes, his voice

02:42.249 --> 02:43.815
was already disguised.
I just cut it together

02:43.859 --> 02:45.208
to make it sound
like an interview.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.776
I need to hear that voicemail.You already did...

02:47.819 --> 02:49.908
In its entirety.
I know you saved sore clips

02:49.952 --> 02:51.736
from that message
to drop in later episodes.

02:51.780 --> 02:55.175
Smart cop.

02:55.218 --> 02:56.306
What's in it for me?

02:56.350 --> 02:57.786
How about your survival?

02:57.829 --> 02:59.440
Are you threatening me?

02:59.483 --> 03:01.355
We think the killer
chose his last two victims

03:01.398 --> 03:02.617
because they knew too much.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.140
If he keeps that up,

03:04.184 --> 03:05.750
you've got a pretty big target
on your back.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.361
Oh.
My guess...

03:07.404 --> 03:09.711
you're next.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.759
All right.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.285
I'll play.

03:18.328 --> 03:19.895
You have my word

03:19.938 --> 03:22.202
that we are doing everything
within our power to bring

03:22.245 --> 03:23.246
the killer to justice,

03:23.290 --> 03:24.769
and that I will
keep you informed

03:24.813 --> 03:26.380
of any new developments.

03:26.423 --> 03:29.426
Hey, is it true another Sleeping
Beauty body was just found?

03:31.776 --> 03:33.604
[camera shutting clicking]

03:37.782 --> 03:39.741
Gunshot wound
to the chest

03:39.784 --> 03:41.264
instead of a bludgeoning,
that's new.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.874
Is our killer evolving?

03:42.918 --> 03:44.354
Makeshift staging,

03:44.398 --> 03:45.616
the trench coat
instead of a blanket,

03:45.660 --> 03:47.270
the purse instead
of a pillow.

03:47.314 --> 03:50.360
Feels like a regression.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.188
And messy. The other bodies
were cleaned up.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.277
What are you thinking?

03:54.321 --> 03:56.323
This isn't the work
of the Sleeping Beauty killer.

03:56.366 --> 03:59.282
Yeah, well, then I'm thinking
this one is for you and Needham.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.589
Detective Teen Beatand I
have enough to keep us busy

04:01.632 --> 04:03.330
with Sleeping Beauty's
actual victims.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.115
A wig?

04:10.162 --> 04:13.296
Plot thickens.I'll let Jasmine know.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.080
I'm sure she'll be happy to tell
the press they got it wrong.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.300
Actually, I don't think we
should go public with that yet.

04:17.344 --> 04:20.738
This murder might be just what
we need to regain control.

04:24.176 --> 04:26.135
What's this?DYLAN: Tranquil blue.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.441
The color I want
to paint the nursery.

04:27.484 --> 04:28.616
You found out it's a boy?

04:28.659 --> 04:31.096
Oh, God, you sound
just like Andy. No.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.229
But he thinks we should wait
until we know the sex

04:33.273 --> 04:35.231
so we don't introduce
gender stereotyping,

04:35.275 --> 04:36.406
but I just happen
to like blue.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.842
Then wait.

04:37.886 --> 04:41.324
And start our child's life
and our parenting

04:41.368 --> 04:43.587
reacting to a superficial
theory that's based

04:43.631 --> 04:44.588
on unproven
anecdotal evidence?

04:44.632 --> 04:46.111
Mm, right. Evidence.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.418
Isn't there a crime scene photo
you needed to show me?

04:48.462 --> 04:49.898
No ID on the victim yet.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.553
She didn't have her phone
or her wallet.

04:52.596 --> 04:53.467
Hmm, robbery?

04:53.510 --> 04:54.772
Not unless the killer was after

04:54.816 --> 04:56.731
something other than money.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.254
The victim was carrying
$500 in cash,

04:58.298 --> 05:00.256
wearing a diamond necklace
and a wig.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.171
Did she have anything
else on her?

05:02.214 --> 05:04.042
Mm-hmm, makeup,
condoms and this.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.569
Hotel key? Where is it to?Mm-hmm.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.571
I don't know, but I know
someone who will.

05:10.614 --> 05:13.617
Oh, of course you do.
So you go handle that,

05:13.661 --> 05:16.228
and I'll, uh, do something else.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.013
You can't avoid him forever.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.363
It was hard enough working
with him while we were dating.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.278
Now the awkwardness
is unbearable.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.802
How about we rip off
the Band-Aid?

05:24.846 --> 05:27.805
Are you telling me that plucky,
tough-as-nails, seen-it-all

05:27.849 --> 05:31.374
Detective Needham can't focus
on her work because of a boy?

05:31.418 --> 05:33.202
Rip it off.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.858
JULIAN:
The Bellmark Hotel.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.033
DYLAN:
Oh.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.426
LIZZIE:
What are you two

05:39.469 --> 05:41.210
psychically conversing
about now?

05:41.253 --> 05:42.559
Well, the Bellmark
is known to cater

05:42.603 --> 05:44.735
to a rather powerful
international clientele.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.389
Like the two of you?

05:46.433 --> 05:47.608
Oh, I've stayed there, yes.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.566
Well, with the wig,
the untouched cash,

05:49.610 --> 05:50.828
and now the hotel,

05:50.872 --> 05:52.569
this is looking like
it might be going deep.

05:52.613 --> 05:55.572
Yes. Uh, maybe
she's the one

05:55.616 --> 05:57.531
who sabotaged
our computers.

05:57.574 --> 06:00.272
Or maybe she's plotting
to take over the world.

06:00.316 --> 06:03.624
Or maybe she's just
a rich woman who likes staying

06:03.667 --> 06:05.408
in nice hotels.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.410
Oh, this was fun.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.412
I'm gonna go and see the hotel

06:09.456 --> 06:12.372
that caters to a "powerful,
international clientele."

06:13.982 --> 06:15.462
[sighs]

06:19.466 --> 06:23.383
Of course Julian
stays here.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.820
I specifically said house seats.

06:25.863 --> 06:28.605
I did not come to New York
to sit in the mezzanine.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.172
Sir, I can arrange
orchestra center seats

06:30.215 --> 06:31.303
for tomorrow night...Forget it.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.741
Thanks for nothing.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.612
Welcome to the Bellmark,
how can I help you?

06:35.656 --> 06:37.484
We'd like to speak with
the manager, please.

06:37.527 --> 06:40.182
Sure. Just one moment.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.184
It's to Vivian
Russo's suite.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.404
She's been with us for about
a week. She's one of our VIPs.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.189
She's scheduled
to check out tomorrow.

06:47.232 --> 06:49.278
Do you have a photo ID
of Vivian on file by any chance?

06:49.321 --> 06:50.540
Mm-hmm.

06:54.239 --> 06:55.415
[door beeps]

07:02.770 --> 07:04.946
Thank you.
We'll take it from here.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.826
Police. Anyone in there?

07:20.135 --> 07:22.093
Police, who are you?

07:24.139 --> 07:26.968
I'm so, so sorry.

07:27.011 --> 07:29.536
Well, I guess we have
our first suspect.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.756
♪

07:44.072 --> 07:46.335
It's the biggest mistake
I ever made,

07:46.378 --> 07:48.642
but did she really
call the cops on me?

07:48.685 --> 07:50.470
What is your
relationship to Vivian?

07:50.513 --> 07:51.688
I'm her protégé.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.516
I mean,

07:53.560 --> 07:55.910
she's my boss,
but she calls me her protégé.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.781
Her protégé in what, exactly?

07:57.825 --> 08:00.480
She's one of the most powerful
PR reps in the whole world.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.873
Who lets her protégé
pass out in her bed?

08:02.917 --> 08:04.440
I was waiting for her.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.615
Last night,

08:05.659 --> 08:07.965
we came up here
to wrap up some work,

08:08.009 --> 08:09.750
and she suggested
that we have a drink,

08:09.793 --> 08:11.534
which she never does.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.624
So I guess I thought...

08:14.668 --> 08:17.018
that might mean that she feels
the same way that I do.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.281
I didn't plan
on telling her.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.022
Telling her what?

08:21.065 --> 08:23.067
That I love her.

08:24.460 --> 08:27.724
She didn't say anything back.

08:27.768 --> 08:30.553
I was so embarrassed I just
grabbed my bag and ran out.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.120
Why does this matter?

08:32.163 --> 08:34.470
Did something happen to Vivian?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.951
We'll get to that.
Uh, how did you get back here?

08:36.994 --> 08:38.953
I walked around
for a couple of hours

08:38.996 --> 08:40.258
until I worked up
the nerve

08:40.302 --> 08:42.347
to call and-and apologize,
but when I did,

08:42.391 --> 08:44.828
her phone rang in my bag.
On top of everything,

08:44.872 --> 08:46.221
I'd accidentally
taken her phone,

08:46.264 --> 08:48.528
so I had to, had to come back
here to return it.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.355
What happened when you got back?

08:50.399 --> 08:53.271
She wasn't here. And I saw
that she had left her wallet,

08:53.315 --> 08:55.360
and she went out with
no wallet and no phone.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.536
I mean, that's weird, right?

08:56.579 --> 08:58.189
Yes. Yes, it is.Exactly.

08:58.233 --> 09:01.062
That's why I was worried.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.542
And I started to drink.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.587
I guess I...

09:04.631 --> 09:06.502
I got really drunk
and I passed out on her bed.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.808
What happened to your hand?

09:07.851 --> 09:10.593
I knocked over the cart.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.116
I was trying
to clean it up,

09:12.160 --> 09:14.292
but I cut my hand
on the bottle instead.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.599
So you told your boss
you love her,

09:16.643 --> 09:17.905
you took her phone,

09:17.948 --> 09:19.559
you got drunk on her
overpriced minibar booze,

09:19.602 --> 09:21.909
you cut your hand, and you
passed out in her bed?

09:21.952 --> 09:24.912
I told you it was a bad night.

09:27.262 --> 09:30.613
So you're telling me, not only
should I not tell the media

09:30.657 --> 09:32.659
this isn't
a Sleeping Beauty kill,

09:32.702 --> 09:35.923
but you want to go on this
podcast and say that it is.

09:35.966 --> 09:38.012
Yes, ma'am, that is exactly
what we're telling you.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.666
Explain.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.189
We think the real
Sleeping Beauty killer

09:41.232 --> 09:42.625
will want to correct
the narrative.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.714
He takes too much pride
in his work and signature

09:44.758 --> 09:47.674
to let us ascribe this
sloppy murder to him.

09:47.717 --> 09:50.633
How do you know he won't correct
the narrative by killing again?

09:50.677 --> 09:53.114
Based on his recent moves--
taunting us,

09:53.157 --> 09:54.724
breaking into
Ryan's hotel room,

09:54.768 --> 09:56.900
leaving the blanket
on his bed-- uh,

09:56.944 --> 09:58.598
we think he's more
focused on the game

09:58.641 --> 10:00.121
he's playing with us
than on killing.

10:00.164 --> 10:02.645
How sure are you
about this?

10:02.689 --> 10:04.386
Oh, stupid question.

10:04.429 --> 10:07.476
You're sure
about everything you say.

10:07.519 --> 10:08.651
[sighs]

10:08.695 --> 10:09.913
I'll think about it.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.005
She likes it.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.485
Footage from
the hotel lobby

10:16.528 --> 10:18.095
confirms Noah's accounts
from last night,

10:18.139 --> 10:19.662
and other than
brief conversations

10:19.706 --> 10:21.098
with the doorman and concierge,

10:21.142 --> 10:23.013
Vivian didn't seem to interact
with anyone there.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.798
But there's more.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.277
Unfortunately,
you're gonna love this.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.889
Mmm.
Vivian's client list.

10:28.932 --> 10:31.587
Her company specialized in
lobbying foreign governments.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.678
Oh, so a powerful woman
with international connections

10:35.722 --> 10:38.638
goes out in a disguise,
carrying only cash?

10:38.681 --> 10:40.552
Mm-hmm.

10:40.596 --> 10:41.771
Say it.

10:41.815 --> 10:44.687
Maybe she isn't
just a rich woman

10:44.731 --> 10:46.689
who likes staying
in nice hotels.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.734
See? That's exactly
what I was thinking.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.431
I'll reach out to the agency.

10:49.474 --> 10:50.867
We unlocked Vivian's phone.
Check it out.

10:50.911 --> 10:53.391
Last night, 10:00 p.m.
DYLAN:
"Sasha"?

10:53.435 --> 10:55.567
No address, no other info.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.134
And no Sasha in the contacts.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.049
We're gonna need to go through
her e-mails, personal files,

10:59.093 --> 11:00.703
see if we can find
a Sasha anywhere.

11:00.747 --> 11:04.446
The ME says he has something
he needs us to see.

11:04.489 --> 11:07.188
DOUG: The bruising patterns
on her wrists and her upper arms

11:07.231 --> 11:09.190
suggest a struggle before death.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.931
Looks like she may have
been restrained.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.628
You do realize
we can't see anything,

11:12.672 --> 11:14.978
right?Wait for it.

11:15.022 --> 11:18.765
I was using a UV light
to look for bodily fluids

11:18.808 --> 11:20.810
and additional skin trauma,
which I didn't find.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.246
Great.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.553
But I did find this.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.163
DYLAN:
Ooh, looks like a depiction

11:26.207 --> 11:30.167
of Harpocrates, the, uh, Greek
god of silence and secrets.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.822
Uh, looks like a stamp
from a nightclub.

11:34.302 --> 11:36.478
The New York god
of "ladies drink free."

11:36.521 --> 11:38.393
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.482
Yes, it could be that.

11:40.525 --> 11:43.703
Hotel camera footage shows you
with Vivian yesterday afternoon.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.139
Do you remember
what you talked about?

11:45.182 --> 11:46.836
Of course.
She was thanking me

11:46.880 --> 11:48.403
for a last-minute dinner
reservation I made for her

11:48.446 --> 11:49.621
at The Grill.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.885
They were booked up,
but it's my job

11:51.928 --> 11:53.930
to get our guests access
to the best parts of the city,

11:53.974 --> 11:55.149
no matter what.

11:55.192 --> 11:56.759
You didn't talk about
anything else?

11:56.803 --> 11:58.630
As far as I remember.

11:58.674 --> 12:02.852
We believe Vivian went to a club
before she died.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.463
Are you sure you didn't
point her in that direction?

12:07.901 --> 12:11.774
This hotel prides
itself on discretion.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.211
If my boss finds out I'm talking
to you, I could lose my job.Gemma,

12:14.255 --> 12:15.909
one of your guests is dead.

12:16.953 --> 12:19.303
Vivian asked me
if I could recommend

12:19.347 --> 12:20.740
an erotic lifestyle club.

12:20.783 --> 12:23.873
I sent her to a place called
Elysian Underground.

12:23.917 --> 12:28.748
It's incredibly expensive,
selective, exclusive.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.053
That's where the stamp is from.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.752
I'm sorry, did you say
"erotic lifestyle club"?

12:32.795 --> 12:36.407
A sex club.Thank you.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.192
A lot of my job

12:38.235 --> 12:41.673
is securing Broadway tickets
and dinner reservations,

12:41.717 --> 12:43.980
but sometimes...

12:44.024 --> 12:45.852
it gets more
interesting than that.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.636
Does the name Sasha
mean anything to you?

12:47.679 --> 12:49.377
No, I don't think so.

12:52.032 --> 12:54.034
[indistinct conversation]

12:55.862 --> 12:58.168
[indistinct conversation
continues]

13:03.304 --> 13:05.393
GEMMA: Someone
you know?
Uh...

13:05.436 --> 13:07.743
just an old friend.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.789
Small world. Maya's singing
in our lounge this week.

13:13.183 --> 13:18.406
So, how does one gain access
to this oh-so-exclusive club?

13:20.843 --> 13:23.846
So, Vivian was meeting this
Sasha person at a sex club.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.848
Explains the outfit
and the wig.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.415
Possibly.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.373
Why is it so
important for you

13:29.417 --> 13:31.898
to think that this could be a
vast international conspiracy?

13:31.941 --> 13:34.770
It could be as simple as
a woman went to a sex club,

13:34.814 --> 13:36.641
ran into a deviant with
no impulse control

13:36.685 --> 13:37.904
who roughed her up
and killed her.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.906
Actually...Oh, here we go.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.908
People who go to these clubs
generally have

13:41.951 --> 13:43.866
a very healthy sense
of sexual boundaries.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.737
Yes, they have an impulse
to do something illicit,

13:45.781 --> 13:48.566
but they manage to do so in a
way that is strictly consensual

13:48.610 --> 13:50.046
and contextually
acceptable.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.483
So you don't think the fact that
she went to a sex club

13:52.527 --> 13:54.094
has anything to do
with her murder?

13:54.137 --> 13:57.532
I'm just not convinced that
the motive was sexual in nature.

13:57.575 --> 13:58.750
If this club
is as secretive

13:58.794 --> 14:00.535
and exclusive as Gemma says,

14:00.578 --> 14:01.841
we could be dealing with
power brokers,

14:01.884 --> 14:03.146
politicians, celebrities...

14:03.190 --> 14:05.279
Exactly the kind of people
Vivian worked for.

14:05.322 --> 14:06.889
And against.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.978
Her client list has multiple
companies with links to Russia.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.894
Sasha is a Russian nickname
for Alexander.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.809
It's also the American name
for Sasha.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.943
What if Vivian went to this club
knowing that Sasha was there

14:16.986 --> 14:18.379
to gain some sort of kompromat

14:18.422 --> 14:20.381
on him?Can't you just say "blackmail"?

14:20.424 --> 14:22.470
It's so much more fun
to say kompromat.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.559
And not all Sashas are Russian.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.343
Either way,
we've got to find him.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.215
Or her.

14:28.258 --> 14:31.000
And...

14:31.044 --> 14:32.915
I'm not sure if people
at this club

14:32.959 --> 14:36.353
are gonna want to talk to...
people like us.

14:36.397 --> 14:39.835
Dylan Reinhart,
are you asking me

14:39.879 --> 14:42.751
to go undercover with you
to a sex club?

14:44.971 --> 14:46.973
Yes, I am.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.203
Though she be but little,
she has

15:00.247 --> 15:02.423
an omnidirectional range
with an extraordinary

15:02.466 --> 15:04.381
high frequency response.

15:04.425 --> 15:05.905
Fierce.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.820
A traditional knot? Really?

15:08.864 --> 15:09.821
Too boring?

15:09.865 --> 15:11.736
Too stodgy.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.087
I believe that Keith,
the hip Scottish oil baron,

15:14.130 --> 15:16.176
would prefer a
one-sided ring knot.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.481
[Scottish accent]:
I think he would.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.571
This is... fun.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.573
Like the old days.Mm-hmm.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.662
Now, remember,

15:24.706 --> 15:26.142
whatever else
you take off...

15:26.186 --> 15:27.927
The bow tie stays on.
Got it.

15:32.322 --> 15:33.454
No.

15:33.497 --> 15:35.282
It wasn't just the bow tie.

15:35.325 --> 15:36.500
What?

15:36.544 --> 15:38.938
Something else is wrong.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.983
You're stiff, holding
something back.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.463
Unlike the older days.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.334
Maya's in town.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.249
Performing
at the Bellmark.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.425
I haven't heard from her.Good.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.861
Especially when
you're vulnerable.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.994
I'm not vulnerable.Didn't you just

15:52.038 --> 15:53.474
have your heart broken?

15:53.517 --> 15:55.476
Do you have to
put it that way?

15:55.519 --> 15:57.173
Be careful.

15:57.217 --> 15:58.392
I will.

15:58.435 --> 16:01.395
I don't make
mistakes twice.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.701
Now, give me your ear.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.313
[door opens]

16:06.356 --> 16:08.054
DYLAN:
Oh, Andy, hi.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.229
You're back early.

16:09.272 --> 16:10.404
Slow night at the bar.
Hi, Julian.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.232
Hello, Andy.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.973
This is an interesting ensemble
you're trying out here.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.191
It's not what it looks like.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.758
So you're dressed like that
and huddling

16:16.801 --> 16:18.542
with Julian because
you're notgoing undercover?

16:18.586 --> 16:19.848
Why don't I give
you two a moment?

16:19.891 --> 16:22.024
That's not necessary.That would be great.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.420
Okay, I am going undercover.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.030
See, now, I thought
those days were behind us.

16:28.074 --> 16:31.425
It's police undercover and
Julian is strictly tech support.

16:31.468 --> 16:35.037
I am merely going with Lizzie
to an elite sex club.

16:35.081 --> 16:38.388
I cannot believe that sounds
like good news right now.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.999
So I guess we're not
gonna continue

16:40.042 --> 16:43.524
the great nursery paint color
debate tonight, huh?

16:43.567 --> 16:45.134
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.528
Yes, no, arguing about
primary colors and gender bias

16:47.571 --> 16:49.834
is exactly how I hope to spend
my free time between,

16:49.878 --> 16:54.404
you know, owning my own bar and
looking for a full-time law gig.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.667
And polishing off
the single malt.

16:56.711 --> 16:57.625
Blame the kilt.

16:57.668 --> 16:58.713
[slams glass]

17:00.454 --> 17:03.892
Are you serious about
going back into law?
Yes,

17:03.935 --> 17:05.502
I am, but...

17:05.546 --> 17:07.374
something tells me
now may not be the best time

17:07.417 --> 17:09.071
to talk about
life-changing decisions.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.986
Why?Well, because
you're obviously

17:11.030 --> 17:13.162
busy with, you know, all this.

17:13.206 --> 17:14.207
[laughs][doorbell rings]

17:14.250 --> 17:15.338
JULIAN:
I've got it.

17:18.559 --> 17:19.951
Hi.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.388
Oh, you look...

17:21.431 --> 17:24.478
Where's Dylan?

17:24.521 --> 17:27.176
Here I am.
Wow, you look...

17:27.220 --> 17:28.177
Wow.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.223
You look hot.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.268
Should I be jealous?[laughs] No more than usual.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.013
All right.Where you going?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.232
To a part of the house

17:39.275 --> 17:41.147
where undercover means
beneath a blanket.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.672
Lizzie...

17:46.848 --> 17:48.545
Your surveillance
gear awaits.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.678
Oh, right.Just give me a minute.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.680
LIZZIE:
Tell Ryan hello.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.727
The universe keeps
bringing us together.

17:56.771 --> 17:59.687
Or Dylan does.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.603
We can work together without
it being weird, right?

18:02.646 --> 18:03.952
Well, absolutely.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.609
For you.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.741
Not weird at all.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.135
Uh, these are beautiful.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.484
This is your lav
mic. I'll be

18:14.528 --> 18:16.747
in direct communication with you
the entire time.

18:16.791 --> 18:17.922
[Australian accent]: You'll be
in direct communication

18:17.966 --> 18:20.011
with Penny,
the Australian sommelier,

18:20.055 --> 18:21.274
the entire time.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.667
Okay then, Penny.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.669
This is a video streaming
lens that will play

18:25.713 --> 18:26.931
to my signal post.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.455
I'll use facial
recognition software

18:28.498 --> 18:30.848
to steer you towards possible
suspects in real time.

18:30.892 --> 18:33.808
You have to admit...

18:33.851 --> 18:35.897
it's really rather cool.

in its rushed staging,

for the killer.

Blue? Pink? Mix them?

28:40.109 --> 28:42.285
[scoffs] What,
and get lavender? No.

28:42.329 --> 28:43.765
What color
does Andy want?

28:43.809 --> 28:45.071
Well, he suggested
green and yellow.

28:45.114 --> 28:46.725
Not because he likes them,
because he believes

28:46.768 --> 28:48.639
they're essentially
gender-neutral.

28:48.683 --> 28:51.904
As if any color had essential
gender characteristics.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.383
It's absurd.

28:53.427 --> 28:54.950
Almost as absurd as you
picking a fight with Andy

28:54.994 --> 28:57.257
about it to make baby
prep more exciting.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.128
That is not what I'm doing.

29:02.088 --> 29:03.480
Oh, that is exactly
what I'm doing.

29:03.524 --> 29:06.092
And you're trying to make
this case more exciting

29:06.135 --> 29:08.355
by needing Sasha to be
the Deputy Prime Minister

29:08.398 --> 29:10.096
of the Federal
States of Wherever,

29:10.139 --> 29:11.924
instead of just
an American dom.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.534
Don't push it.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.362
I think you're terrified
of being boring

29:15.405 --> 29:17.059
and you're not ready to
give up your old life.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.105
I already did give it up.

29:19.148 --> 29:20.236
A-Almost.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.890
And for the record,
I fully expect Sasha

29:21.934 --> 29:24.327
to lead us to the
Deputy Prime Minister

29:24.371 --> 29:26.503
of the Federal States
of Whatever.

29:26.547 --> 29:28.505
I admire your
wishful optimism.

29:28.549 --> 29:29.942
He was with her on
the last night of her life,

29:29.985 --> 29:31.247
maybe she said something.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.814
From my time with Sasha,

29:32.858 --> 29:34.947
conversation didn't
seem to be his thing.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.383
Well, maybe he
saw something.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.951
He's all we've got
right now.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.042
Ugh, what I wouldn't give

29:43.085 --> 29:44.434
to have my summons
book right now.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.654
I would love to
ticket those jerks.

29:46.697 --> 29:51.267
Illegally parked like
it's their street.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.008
There he is.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.063
Back off!
Police.

30:04.106 --> 30:06.021
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm sorry, I heard

30:06.065 --> 30:07.501
someone coming behind me,
and there's been a lot

30:07.544 --> 30:08.850
of muggings in this
neighborhood recently.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.243
You're the woman who...

30:10.286 --> 30:12.636
Asks a lot of questions.
You mentioned muggings?

30:12.680 --> 30:14.029
Yeah.

30:14.073 --> 30:16.292
And then last night,
some lady ends up dead.

30:16.336 --> 30:17.816
They think it's
that serial killer,

30:17.859 --> 30:19.165
so obviously everyone's
a little... jumpy.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.688
Is that why you're here?

30:20.731 --> 30:22.081
Yes, we have some questions
about Vivian Russo,

30:22.124 --> 30:25.954
the woman who was killed
and who you left marks on.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.173
God, it was her?

30:27.216 --> 30:29.088
There's not much
to tell, I mean,

30:29.131 --> 30:32.134
we did some basic dom play;
restraints, light paddling.

30:32.178 --> 30:34.354
Explains the bruising.Yeah, I mean,

30:34.397 --> 30:36.138
I probably spent 15
minutes with them, total.

30:36.182 --> 30:39.054
Them?The guy she was with.

30:39.098 --> 30:40.969
What guy?He's been in the club

30:41.013 --> 30:42.275
a few times, goes by Jack.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.712
I think he's some
foreign government bigwig.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.061
Sexy accent.

30:46.105 --> 30:47.410
Sort of like the one
you were faking.

30:47.454 --> 30:48.977
What was that
supposed to be?

30:49.021 --> 30:51.197
Australian?

30:51.240 --> 30:52.851
Does Jack have
a last name?

30:52.894 --> 30:55.027
Not really a last name
kind of place.

30:55.070 --> 30:56.898
You think he's the killer?

30:56.942 --> 30:59.118
Thank you. Please be in
touch if you remember

30:59.161 --> 31:02.208
anything else
and don't leave town. Okay?

31:02.251 --> 31:04.253
So, we're looking
for an Australian.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.821
Diplomat? Spy?

31:08.388 --> 31:09.911
Dialect coach?

31:09.955 --> 31:12.566
My accent was perfect,
by the way.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.226
G'day, mate!

31:20.269 --> 31:22.184
I woke up this morning
thinking about

31:22.228 --> 31:24.012
our conversation with Sasha
and I realized something.

31:24.056 --> 31:26.145
Me, too. And I don't mean
to be competitive,

31:26.188 --> 31:27.581
but I think mine's better.

31:27.624 --> 31:30.105
Why don't you tell me
yours first?

31:30.149 --> 31:31.454
Okay...This is where you say,

31:31.498 --> 31:33.195
"No, you're the boss.
You go first."
[chuckles]

31:33.239 --> 31:36.938
Remember those illegally parked
cars outside Elysian?

31:36.982 --> 31:38.461
Well, I had Zack pull up

31:38.505 --> 31:40.681
all the parking tickets
within a five-block radius

31:40.724 --> 31:43.902
of the club on the night
that Vivian was killed.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.904
There was a car registered
to the South African embassy.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.210
Now, while South Africa
is not Australia,

31:48.254 --> 31:52.649
their accents do sound
similar to the untrained ear.

31:52.693 --> 31:54.869
Is there a lede
you're burying?
Yes.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.350
Vivian's company represents
several diamond brokers

31:57.393 --> 31:59.961
who are trying to gain access
to one of South Africa's mines.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.223
If the South African government

32:01.267 --> 32:03.617
doesn't want that company
in their mines,

32:03.660 --> 32:06.272
maybe the diplomat
had motive to...

32:06.315 --> 32:07.795
send a message.

32:07.838 --> 32:10.058
By killing Vivian?Yes.

32:10.102 --> 32:13.061
Maybe you should pitch
this theory to your new editor,

32:13.105 --> 32:14.715
because it would make
a fascinating novel.

32:14.758 --> 32:18.110
Is this your way of saying your
realization is better than mine?

32:18.153 --> 32:19.981
Not to be competitive, but yes.Mm-hmm.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.809
I realized we've been
looking at this all wrong.

32:21.852 --> 32:23.637
Is there a lede you're burying?

32:23.680 --> 32:26.509
Big Sasha said that there
have been muggings in the area,

32:26.553 --> 32:29.164
but I checked and there hasn't
been a single mugging reported

32:29.208 --> 32:30.818
in that neighborhood
in over three months.

32:30.861 --> 32:32.341
So you think he's lying?No.

32:32.385 --> 32:34.213
I think someone
is mugging people, but I think

32:34.256 --> 32:36.215
they're targeting victims
who wouldn't want to report it.

32:36.258 --> 32:38.826
Who wouldn't want to be
explaining what they were doing

32:38.869 --> 32:42.003
in that area,
like frequenting a sex club.So...

32:42.047 --> 32:44.919
if the killer only meant
to mug Vivian,

32:44.963 --> 32:47.139
but it ended up in murder,
maybe he panicked,

32:47.182 --> 32:48.923
then tried to make it look like
a Sleeping Beauty kill

32:48.967 --> 32:50.969
as cover.Which would explain

32:51.012 --> 32:53.232
why she still had her cash
and jewelry on her.

32:53.275 --> 32:54.189
And it almost worked.

32:54.233 --> 32:57.149

who you say you are?

33:56.425 --> 33:59.472

33:59.515 --> 34:02.431
cowboy blankets and cat's blood.

34:19.796 --> 34:21.363
No, this guy knows
what he's doing.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.713
Call originated from an

Quite the opposite.

34:29.763 --> 34:31.069
He gave us a lot to analyze,

34:31.112 --> 34:32.896
both by what he said
and how he said it.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.333
And how is that?

34:34.376 --> 34:35.682
Confidently.

34:35.725 --> 34:37.597
He called you by your first name

34:37.640 --> 34:39.468
without hesitation.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.122
That tells me that
he felt familiarity

34:41.166 --> 34:43.298
and comfort with you.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.007

She's maxed out

36:25.400 --> 36:27.054

she's been paying off

36:28.838 --> 36:30.318

36:30.362 --> 36:32.233
That's a lot of extra cash
to suddenly have around.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.583
I think she's been sending
guests to cash businesses,

36:34.627 --> 36:36.063

36:36.106 --> 36:38.065

Given Vivian's gunshot wound,
we know that Gemma has a gun,

36:41.068 --> 36:43.244
which would intimidate anyone,
and if she wore a mask,

36:43.288 --> 36:45.246
no one from the hotel
would recognize her.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.161
It's actually
a really clever plan.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.990
The only thing I can't figure
out is why do it this way?

36:50.033 --> 36:53.080
Why mug people on a dark street
corner when she has access

36:53.123 --> 36:55.213
to so many rich, powerful
people right at the hotel?

36:55.256 --> 36:56.997
Well, there would be
an electronic paper trail

36:57.040 --> 36:59.042
at the hotel. If she were
stealing credit card numbers

36:59.086 --> 37:01.088

it could be traced.

And maybe it wasn't
just about the money.

I don't think
you meant to kill Vivian.

38:42.972 --> 38:46.715

39:03.166 --> 39:07.432
So I guess not everything
is a huge conspiracy.

39:07.475 --> 39:10.391
I'm sorry, is this your way
of saying that I'm right?

39:10.435 --> 39:12.437
Mm. Was that not clear?

39:12.480 --> 39:15.222
It wasn't, but luckily my
detective skills are top-notch,

39:15.265 --> 39:17.616
so I was able to decipher
the hidden meaning.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.226
Congratulations.

39:19.269 --> 39:20.488
You were right.

39:20.532 --> 39:23.056
[phone chimes, buzzes]

39:24.579 --> 39:26.581
Hmm.

39:28.278 --> 39:30.411
So it's really over
between you two?

39:30.455 --> 39:32.021
Romantically, yes.

39:32.065 --> 39:34.894
I can't live my life seeing
conspiracy and danger

39:34.937 --> 39:36.112
everywhere I look.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.810
ANDY:
Ding dong.

39:37.853 --> 39:39.638
Pizza boy's here.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.291
Anybody order
the large meat lover's?

39:41.335 --> 39:43.381
I think that's my cue.

39:43.424 --> 39:48.037
[laughs]: No, he's just jealous
about our erotic adventure.

39:48.081 --> 39:50.257
Sure you don't want to stay?No, maybe next time.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.001
[applause]Thank you.

40:01.877 --> 40:04.445
Hello, Maya.

40:04.489 --> 40:07.970
Julian, what a lovely surprise.

40:08.014 --> 40:10.146
What brings you to New York?My show.

40:10.190 --> 40:14.194
You can still carry a tune,
and you're looking well.

40:14.237 --> 40:16.152
So are you, considering.

40:16.196 --> 40:17.980
Considering what?Shot at,

40:18.024 --> 40:20.592
office burned, broken ribs
and a broken relationship.

40:20.635 --> 40:24.030
Are you still working with MI6?Yes.

40:24.073 --> 40:27.468
And even though you aren't,
we do still keep tabs on you.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.165
We believe that
the person who's after you

40:29.209 --> 40:31.646
is someone
that we have been tracking.

40:31.690 --> 40:34.388
He was certainly close enough
to the 11th precinct

40:34.432 --> 40:37.217
to be able to plant
that malware you discovered.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.524
Now, since we are both hunting
the same person,

40:39.567 --> 40:41.351
we would like to enlist
your help,

40:41.395 --> 40:42.788
and I believe
that we can be

40:42.831 --> 40:45.530
mutually beneficial
to each other.

40:45.573 --> 40:47.793
What are you suggesting?

41:02.938 --> 41:05.288
I'm sorry.

41:05.332 --> 41:08.683
Yeah. Me, too.

41:08.727 --> 41:10.337
I have to confess.

41:10.380 --> 41:13.166
I got a little scared
when I saw you all dressed up,

41:13.209 --> 41:16.996
and Julian over here with
his briefcase full of spy stuff.

41:17.039 --> 41:18.780
Yeah, well,
I have a confession, too.

41:18.824 --> 41:21.217
Last night when I was
undercover,

41:21.261 --> 41:26.484
i-it reminded me of my old life,
and... I liked it.

41:26.527 --> 41:29.095
It was exciting
and dangerous

41:29.138 --> 41:31.227
and fun.

41:32.272 --> 41:33.534
But then, there was a moment

41:33.578 --> 41:35.623
when I thought Lizzie was
in real danger,

41:35.667 --> 41:40.933
and it wasn't exciting or fun
anymore, just terrifying.

41:40.976 --> 41:43.501
And I realized that's how you
must have felt all the time

41:43.544 --> 41:46.242
when I was a spy,
not knowing where I was

41:46.286 --> 41:48.157
or if I was
in danger.

41:48.201 --> 41:49.332
And I never want

41:49.376 --> 41:50.725
to scare you like that

41:50.769 --> 41:52.292
or make you feel
worried like that ever again,

41:52.335 --> 41:54.250
especially not now,
with our baby on the way.

41:54.294 --> 41:58.037
Oh, my God, you're worried if
you're built for domestic life?

41:58.080 --> 42:01.301
Yeah.I'm worried about
the same thing.

42:01.344 --> 42:03.433
Hence the search
for the new law gig?

42:03.477 --> 42:07.394
No. No, no, that's, that's not
a reaction to anything.

42:07.437 --> 42:10.179
That's, uh, getting back into
law is just what I want to do.

42:10.223 --> 42:12.573
Oh.But I am freaking out about

42:12.617 --> 42:14.183
this whole thing, too.
I mean, having a baby

42:14.227 --> 42:15.968
is going to
give both of us

42:16.011 --> 42:20.494
so much to worry about, more
than just the paint color.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.409
Yeah.

42:22.452 --> 42:25.325
Yeah, and I was fighting against
more than the paint color, too.

42:25.368 --> 42:27.893
Mm-hmm.
So that is why

42:27.936 --> 42:31.592
I think we should paint
the nursery white.

42:31.636 --> 42:36.466
A nice, neutral,
non-gender-biased,

42:36.510 --> 42:41.907
non-color... color.

42:41.950 --> 42:43.865
Yeah.

42:43.909 --> 42:45.911
Yellow it is.
