00:04.169 --> 00:06.572
Yep, you're probably right.

00:08.506 --> 00:11.141
I don't know what
I'm talking about.

00:11.143 --> 00:14.514
Forget about my
degree and experience.

00:15.948 --> 00:19.451
What's important, after
all, how you feel.

00:21.085 --> 00:23.853
You tell me you like girls?

00:23.855 --> 00:25.857
Great, go for it, buddy.

00:26.758 --> 00:27.927
You like boys?

00:28.893 --> 00:30.128
All the better.

00:31.262 --> 00:33.663
You do what you feel.

00:33.665 --> 00:35.898
I could tell you
all about safe sex,

00:35.900 --> 00:39.001
give you a condom, but it'd
only be a matter of time

00:39.003 --> 00:42.140
before you picked
up some ungodly STD.

00:43.542 --> 00:47.010
Unleashing all your carnal
cravings on whatever sweet thing

00:47.012 --> 00:49.482
walked through the door, yeah.

00:50.781 --> 00:52.485
But I won't stop you.

00:53.751 --> 00:55.720
Nope, you enjoy your herpes.

02:41.993 --> 02:45.228
you look good,
considering, yeah.

02:45.230 --> 02:46.363
Let's go take a look at
your office, come on.

02:46.365 --> 02:48.568
Well, show me the way.

02:49.835 --> 02:51.266
It's a closet.

02:51.268 --> 02:53.036
It's a start.

02:53.038 --> 02:57.273
Uh huh, the door is
bigger than the entire room.

03:05.150 --> 03:06.782
You stole my title.

03:06.784 --> 03:08.984
One of the best student
papers I ever read.

03:08.986 --> 03:10.353
How do you do it?

03:10.355 --> 03:12.855
Well, when you're in
chapel five days a week,

03:12.857 --> 03:15.091
you got a lot to pull from.

03:15.093 --> 03:17.693
Most of us used to swipe
our card and leave anyways.

03:17.695 --> 03:19.194
Until that landed
you and your buddies

03:19.196 --> 03:21.698
in front of my
disciplinary board.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.000
You really should not have
run from the campus cops.

03:24.869 --> 03:27.836
I just couldn't take
another installment

03:27.838 --> 03:31.306
of Dr. Nessey's, The Four
Voices of the Tishbite.

03:31.308 --> 03:35.679
The tortures of the
damned, my friend.

03:35.681 --> 03:38.214
What ever happened to him?

03:38.216 --> 03:41.450
His wife left him for a woman.

03:46.957 --> 03:49.158
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

03:49.160 --> 03:50.325
It's too soon, right?

03:50.327 --> 03:51.995
That's all right.

03:51.997 --> 03:54.898
At least she left
me the car, right?

03:54.900 --> 03:58.234
And the car payments
and the student loans

03:58.236 --> 03:59.168
- and the...
- That's,

03:59.170 --> 04:00.770
that is all behind you.

04:00.772 --> 04:03.940
Now you are back with friends.

04:03.942 --> 04:04.907
So where are you staying?

04:06.077 --> 04:08.144
Aunt Patty.

04:08.146 --> 04:10.079
Ah.

04:10.081 --> 04:13.852
I'm surprised
she's still breathing.

04:25.063 --> 04:30.068

05:01.532 --> 05:02.367
Patty?

05:06.003 --> 05:06.905
Whoa, what?

05:09.541 --> 05:10.375
Mm, uh mm.

05:40.104 --> 05:42.205
Yeah, I need to
report a dead body.

05:42.207 --> 05:43.573
Gotcha, Dave.

05:43.575 --> 05:46.344
Gotcha.

05:49.847 --> 05:52.784
I've been waiting
weeks to do this.

05:54.219 --> 05:56.255
What took you so long?

06:25.584 --> 06:27.049
Good morning, everyone.

06:27.051 --> 06:28.083
Good morning.

06:28.085 --> 06:29.921
My name is Mr. Hopper.

06:31.623 --> 06:33.392
Welcome to Psych 101.

06:36.161 --> 06:40.128
Now, as far as I'm
concerned the basis

06:40.130 --> 06:42.898
for our understanding
of human behavior

06:42.900 --> 06:46.001
can clearly be
found in the Bible,

06:46.003 --> 06:47.203
and that's where we'll begin.

06:47.205 --> 06:49.338
Now we're gonna start each class

06:49.340 --> 06:51.273
by answering one question.

06:51.275 --> 06:52.941
Any question, I will give you

06:52.943 --> 06:55.578
my honest black
and white answer.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.347
Give me something tough.

06:57.349 --> 06:58.183
Anything.

07:02.921 --> 07:03.556
Mr. Uh?

07:05.356 --> 07:06.191
Nate.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.197
Why does God hate gay people?

07:15.267 --> 07:16.665
There it is.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.571
The issue of your
generation, the gays.

07:22.373 --> 07:25.910
We hear things like
it's the new normal,

07:27.544 --> 07:31.347
an acceptable lifestyle,
and that Christians,

07:31.349 --> 07:35.587
and others who oppose that
practice are homophobic.

07:37.421 --> 07:40.592
Nate, I'm not afraid
of homosexuality,

07:41.558 --> 07:44.095
I just know that it's wrong.

07:46.063 --> 07:48.534
It destroys people and families.

07:51.169 --> 07:52.301
I've seen it.

07:53.404 --> 07:54.537
Come in.

07:59.077 --> 08:00.246
What's this?

08:02.347 --> 08:03.612
Building a house?

08:03.614 --> 08:06.515
Uh huh, for the
psych department.

08:06.517 --> 08:07.450
We have a psych department?

08:07.452 --> 08:09.184
Not yet.

08:09.186 --> 08:12.388
We wanna get the Cash Feed
property over on Wabash,

08:12.390 --> 08:13.989
have it ready for the fall.

08:13.991 --> 08:16.592
Oh yeah, love that building.

08:16.594 --> 08:18.294
Who's gonna head it?

08:18.296 --> 08:21.364
I was hoping that you would.

08:21.366 --> 08:23.498
I've taught like one class.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.535
Nobody cares.

08:25.537 --> 08:27.102
You've got real-world
experience.

08:27.104 --> 08:29.104
You're young, you're committed.

08:29.106 --> 08:32.075
Board eats that
sort of stuff up.

08:35.179 --> 08:36.015
What?

08:37.381 --> 08:41.216
It's ridiculous,
I'm starting to think

08:41.217 --> 08:44.119
we may not be able to get it.

08:44.121 --> 08:46.455
Well, what ever happened to

08:46.457 --> 08:49.962
attempt great things,
expect great things?

08:52.396 --> 08:54.229
There's a support group, okay?

08:54.231 --> 08:55.998
The recently deceased
owner of the property

08:56.000 --> 08:57.566
willed it to them
as long as they

08:57.568 --> 08:59.435
could raise money to
pay the back taxes,

08:59.437 --> 09:01.771
and it's only rumors, I have
no way of knowing for sure,

09:01.773 --> 09:04.773
but it sounds like
they're getting close.

09:04.775 --> 09:06.441
Is there no other building?

09:06.443 --> 09:09.445
Not like that.

09:09.447 --> 09:12.715
Not at that price or
with that history.

09:12.717 --> 09:15.084
It's breath-taking.

09:22.260 --> 09:23.692
It smells good
in there, Patty.

09:23.694 --> 09:25.194
Do you need any help?

09:25.196 --> 09:27.499
Do you like vajatas?

09:28.533 --> 09:29.665
What?

09:29.667 --> 09:30.733
Vajatas.

09:30.735 --> 09:32.337
Do you like them?

09:38.143 --> 09:40.542
Fajitas, I love fajitas.

09:40.544 --> 09:42.412
That's what I said.

09:42.414 --> 09:43.649
Go have a seat.

10:00.765 --> 10:03.733
Let me go check out the group.

10:03.735 --> 10:05.167
Hmm?

10:05.169 --> 10:08.537
The support group,
just check it out.

10:08.539 --> 10:12.441
Not say anything, find out how
close they are to the money.

10:12.443 --> 10:13.508
I don't know, Dave.

10:13.510 --> 10:15.777
That sounds a little deceitful.

10:15.779 --> 10:17.613
It's research.

10:17.615 --> 10:18.447
Where do they meet?

10:21.452 --> 10:25.588
Over by that hippie
church on Main Street.

10:25.590 --> 10:26.855
I think.

10:40.105 --> 10:43.605
Hi, are you
here for the group?

10:43.607 --> 10:45.108
I think so.

10:45.110 --> 10:45.711
Great!

10:51.182 --> 10:52.148
Come on in.

10:52.150 --> 10:54.749
That's how it works.

11:10.568 --> 11:13.702
Hey, am I at the right place?

11:13.704 --> 11:16.074
It depends, are you gay?

11:17.442 --> 11:20.176
It's not a trick question.

11:20.178 --> 11:23.345
Your shirt says
you are, come on.

11:23.347 --> 11:24.580
Hey guys, Alyssa's gonna be late

11:24.582 --> 11:26.516
so I'm gonna lead
discussion tonight.

11:26.518 --> 11:28.618
Oh, no he didn't!

11:28.620 --> 11:31.220
Yes, right in the
middle of service!

11:31.222 --> 11:32.754
We were at the alter-call-thing

11:32.756 --> 11:35.490
and the pastor says to
me, with his mic on,

11:35.492 --> 11:36.459
are you a lesbian?

11:36.461 --> 11:38.628
Girl, he didn't.

11:38.630 --> 11:42.665
And I said, I'm not here for
sex, I'm here for salvation

11:42.667 --> 11:44.466
and I'll go find it
elsewhere, thank you.

11:45.803 --> 11:48.838
That was like eight
years ago though, babe.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.574
More things are much
better now, more accepting.

11:51.576 --> 11:53.209
Some of us are changing.

11:53.211 --> 11:55.610
I guess, let's
start like usual,

11:55.612 --> 11:57.846
everyone says their name
and why they're here.

11:57.848 --> 11:59.484
Rosa, can you start?

12:00.952 --> 12:03.619
My name is Rosa and I'm
here to support my wife,

12:03.621 --> 12:04.586
although I don't think
it's worth the cost

12:04.588 --> 12:06.190
of a baby sitter.

12:06.890 --> 12:08.356
And to make sure she grows up

12:08.358 --> 12:11.527
in a less hateful
world than we did.

12:11.529 --> 12:12.662
Bruce?

12:12.664 --> 12:13.830
Hello, my name is Bruce.

12:13.832 --> 12:17.733
And I've been a member of the
gay community my whole life.

12:17.735 --> 12:19.502
Hi everyone, I'm Richard,

12:19.504 --> 12:21.671
and I'm here to
love on my family.

12:21.673 --> 12:24.606
That's what you are,
you're my family.

12:24.608 --> 12:26.911
His family doesn't like him.

12:28.513 --> 12:30.912
Well, I'm Kyle, and I've
been questioning my sexuality

12:30.914 --> 12:33.516
for about four years now.

12:33.518 --> 12:34.786
He's not gay.

12:36.420 --> 12:39.922
I'm Mark, I'm the pastor
at the church next door.

12:39.924 --> 12:43.692
I love people,
that's why I'm here.

12:43.694 --> 12:44.929
What about you?

12:47.698 --> 12:48.663
Mm-hmm.

12:48.665 --> 12:50.568
Oh, uh, I don't really...

12:53.571 --> 12:56.939
It's okay to just
start with your name.

12:56.941 --> 12:58.773
Right, oh okay.

12:58.775 --> 13:00.909
Um, my name is Dave.

13:00.911 --> 13:03.581
Just moved here a few days ago.

13:04.716 --> 13:08.450
Uh, living with my
aunt and I don't like

13:08.452 --> 13:10.753
to talk about my sexuality.

13:10.755 --> 13:12.622
It's okay, we all understand.

13:12.624 --> 13:13.623
We're really glad you're here.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.492
We've all been there.

13:16.494 --> 13:18.761
Erika, do you wanna go?

13:18.763 --> 13:19.598
Pass.

13:21.598 --> 13:22.831
We can do that?

13:22.833 --> 13:23.669
Okay.

13:25.303 --> 13:26.469
Does anyone have anything

13:26.471 --> 13:28.303
they need support with tonight?

13:29.640 --> 13:31.706
That little shit behind
the counter did it again.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.743
Every time I go to that
gas station on the corner

13:33.745 --> 13:35.677
I catch him spewing his hate!

13:35.679 --> 13:38.913
Your god is love,
bitch, why can't you be?

13:41.285 --> 13:42.654
It's okay.

13:44.655 --> 13:46.689
Hi.

13:46.691 --> 13:50.593
Hi.

13:50.595 --> 13:51.630
Not gay.

13:52.563 --> 13:54.964
I just got back from
the attorney's office,

13:54.966 --> 13:57.399
and we're all set to
go on the property.

13:57.401 --> 13:58.633
We just need to get the money

13:58.635 --> 13:59.869
to cover the taxes
and it's ours!

13:59.871 --> 14:02.338
Well, how much
money do we need?

14:02.340 --> 14:05.907
$50 thousand in 30 days
and we're at about 10.

14:05.909 --> 14:07.843
We need everyone at
the car wash, everyone.

14:07.845 --> 14:09.378
Yes, please.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.614
Uh, sorry, car wash?

14:11.616 --> 14:13.816
Yeah, yep, a car wash.

14:13.818 --> 14:16.451
It just seems like
a lot of cars to wash.

14:16.453 --> 14:18.687
Honey, you have not
seen us wash cars.

14:18.689 --> 14:21.525
Okay?

14:23.060 --> 14:23.926
Right.

14:24.861 --> 14:27.495
Girl.
Okay, on you.

14:27.497 --> 14:28.596
We'll see you soon.

14:28.598 --> 14:29.665
- All right, now.
- Okay.

14:29.667 --> 14:30.666
Only one cookie now.

14:30.668 --> 14:33.337
I deserve it, thank you, okay?

14:38.875 --> 14:39.810
I'm Dave.

14:43.581 --> 14:45.417
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

14:46.083 --> 14:47.450
Mm-hmm.

14:47.452 --> 14:49.784
I had to do something
about your shirt.

14:49.786 --> 14:51.789
So I hear you're not...

14:53.725 --> 14:54.724
Not what?

14:54.726 --> 14:56.758
Uh, afraid of a challenge.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.661
No.

14:58.663 --> 15:00.428
40,000 in three weeks.

15:00.430 --> 15:02.764
This shelter is gonna happen.

15:02.766 --> 15:03.832
Shelter?

15:03.834 --> 15:05.768
It's for everyone who
needs a place to feel safe.

15:05.770 --> 15:07.769
Well, isn't that what
Good Shepherd's for?

15:07.771 --> 15:10.538
Not if you're gay, darling.

15:10.540 --> 15:13.375
Bruce, have you met Dave?

15:13.377 --> 15:14.976
Yes, we have, we
met at the circle.

15:14.978 --> 15:18.349
And Dave is new to
town, he is single,

15:19.583 --> 15:21.917
and he lives with his aunt.

15:21.919 --> 15:23.918
And he hasn't talked about
sexuality much though.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.854
Oh, that's understandable.

15:25.856 --> 15:27.623
It gets better.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.461
Be seeing you, Dave.

15:34.698 --> 15:35.764
Oh.

15:35.766 --> 15:37.800
Why didn't you tell me?

15:37.802 --> 15:38.868
Do they have it?

15:38.870 --> 15:39.902
Did you know?

15:39.904 --> 15:41.870
Do they have it?

15:41.872 --> 15:43.739
- No, they don't.
- Excellent.

15:44.808 --> 15:48.112
Not even close.

15:49.013 --> 15:51.116
Gordon, it's a gay group.

15:54.018 --> 15:55.850
All right, that would
have been nice to know.

15:55.852 --> 15:57.987
That would have been
great to know actually

15:57.989 --> 16:02.191
and you know you'd think
they want it for a gay bar

16:02.193 --> 16:04.759
or maybe some sort of sex house.

16:04.761 --> 16:08.129
But they want it for
a homeless shelter.

16:08.131 --> 16:09.532
Did you know that?

16:09.534 --> 16:11.633
No Dave, how
could I know that?

16:11.635 --> 16:14.537
And so what if they want
it for a homeless shelter?

16:14.539 --> 16:15.805
You want those poor kids

16:15.807 --> 16:18.606
taken off the street
taken by sodomites?

16:18.608 --> 16:20.678
- No.
- No, of course not.

16:21.946 --> 16:24.680
But like I said
they're unorganized.

16:24.682 --> 16:26.581
All they have are car washes.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.817
You haven't seen
gays wash cars.

16:28.819 --> 16:31.487
I will this weekend.

16:31.489 --> 16:32.491
Will what?

16:33.790 --> 16:35.191
You're going back?

16:35.193 --> 16:37.225
Why would you you do that?

16:37.227 --> 16:38.060
Because what if I...

16:38.062 --> 16:39.431
Sabotage it?

16:42.500 --> 16:45.167
Jesus flipped over tables
and whipped sinners

16:45.169 --> 16:47.802
to rid the temple of evil.

16:47.804 --> 16:50.141
Desperate times, my brother.

16:52.009 --> 16:53.478
Ha, great idea.

16:54.911 --> 16:57.782
So who's got a question today?

16:59.650 --> 17:00.883
Yes, Nate.

17:00.885 --> 17:03.652
Does a person
choose to be gay?

17:03.654 --> 17:04.790
Wow, obsessed?

17:06.590 --> 17:10.224
Okay, well it's complicated,
but in most cases,

17:10.227 --> 17:12.694
the psycho-social choice
can be traced back

17:12.696 --> 17:16.897
to some kind of abuse or
negative impact growing up.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.800
Call it a distant father,
an overbearing mother.

17:19.803 --> 17:21.837
Sometimes it's as
simple as a gay man

17:21.839 --> 17:24.005
has never had a chance
to be with a woman,

17:24.007 --> 17:26.708
hindering his
sexual development.

17:26.710 --> 17:29.144
So they're attracted
to the same sex

17:29.146 --> 17:32.947
because they never
kissed the opposite sex?

17:32.949 --> 17:34.486
Psycho-social.

17:36.821 --> 17:38.219
When have you kissed a man?

17:41.092 --> 17:42.757
I'm sorry?

17:42.759 --> 17:44.959
I don't know, maybe you
don't know you're gay.

17:44.961 --> 17:45.994
Maybe if you kissed a man

17:45.996 --> 17:47.763
you'd find you really like men.

17:50.735 --> 17:51.570
Stop it.

17:59.576 --> 18:00.211
Patty?

18:03.714 --> 18:04.780
Patty?

18:04.782 --> 18:05.747
I ain't Patty.

18:05.749 --> 18:06.884
Holy, clearly.

18:07.985 --> 18:09.118
Who are you?

18:09.120 --> 18:09.754
Frank.

18:10.888 --> 18:13.923
You must be Dave, Patty tells me

18:13.925 --> 18:16.591
you don't know how
to please a woman.

18:16.593 --> 18:20.628
Um, okay Frank, that
is none of your business

18:20.630 --> 18:22.534
and it's mostly untrue.

18:23.967 --> 18:27.269
Ain't nobody ever told you
how to be a 60 minute man?

18:27.271 --> 18:28.169
Um...

18:28.171 --> 18:30.272
A 60 minute man.

18:30.274 --> 18:34.976
15 minutes a cuddling,
15 minutes a smooching,

18:34.978 --> 18:36.011
15 minutes a rubbing...

18:36.013 --> 18:37.716
Whoa, okay, wow.

18:39.883 --> 18:41.317
Thank you, please stop though.

18:41.319 --> 18:42.984
Why are you here, Frank?

18:42.986 --> 18:46.187
I'm whatcha call Patty's
friend with benefits.

18:46.189 --> 18:50.125
We share our Social
Security income and meds.

18:50.127 --> 18:53.963
I give her my downers and
she gives me her uppers.

18:55.065 --> 18:56.031
Okay.

18:56.033 --> 18:57.065
Where is she?

18:57.067 --> 18:58.202
Frank.

19:00.371 --> 19:05.040
I tell you what, you
go give her these pills,

19:05.042 --> 19:07.044
but you gotta wear this.

19:08.044 --> 19:09.811
Um, mm, I don't...

19:09.813 --> 19:11.379
Oh, it'll freak her out.

19:11.381 --> 19:13.948
She's all the time
pullin' crap with me

19:13.950 --> 19:15.917
and she'll get you before long?

19:15.919 --> 19:16.985
She already did.

19:16.987 --> 19:18.957
Here's your chance.

19:21.993 --> 19:23.993
Gonna regret this.

19:23.995 --> 19:25.060
Mm-hmm.

19:25.062 --> 19:26.995
It's a bad idea.

19:26.997 --> 19:28.165
Bad, bad idea.

19:30.101 --> 19:32.603
Frank, where you at?

19:35.238 --> 19:37.005
Frank, I'm ready for you.

19:38.042 --> 19:39.207
- Oh!
- Oh no.

19:39.209 --> 19:40.044
No.

19:41.111 --> 19:43.047
Gotcha Patty!

19:44.180 --> 19:45.414
Frank.

19:50.388 --> 19:51.320
At night?

20:03.066 --> 20:05.236
Woo, our first customer!

20:06.403 --> 20:08.070
Your wash will be
for free, handsome,

20:08.072 --> 20:10.074
but then you gotta help.

20:12.709 --> 20:15.279

this makes sense.

Success.

22:52.136 --> 22:54.136
There's no way they
made money off of that.

22:54.138 --> 22:55.840
I don't wanna know.

23:01.845 --> 23:03.344
So what's the
deal with the bi's?

23:04.582 --> 23:06.849
I mean, make up
your mind already.

23:06.851 --> 23:08.116
Am I right?

23:08.118 --> 23:11.052
And you guys, you've
got it the hardest.

23:11.054 --> 23:13.054
Raising that girl.

23:13.056 --> 23:15.456
No greater responsibility.

23:15.458 --> 23:19.464
How does it feel to know
that your support group

23:20.363 --> 23:22.199
thinks you're not gay?

23:23.234 --> 23:24.269
Hmm.

23:25.335 --> 23:29.807
If it were me, I'd find a
place I was more accepted.

23:31.242 --> 23:35.346
I look at you and I look at
everyone else around here,

23:36.280 --> 23:38.513
don't near cares like you do.

23:38.515 --> 23:40.514
Where's their passion?

23:40.516 --> 23:42.352
I see it in your eyes.

23:43.353 --> 23:44.887
Don't see it in theirs.

23:45.622 --> 23:48.226
You've been here what, a year?

23:49.325 --> 23:52.394
Still no gender
neutral bathrooms.

23:52.396 --> 23:54.228
Must be tough.

23:54.230 --> 23:58.065
Do they have to get
childcare or do homework?

23:58.067 --> 24:00.369
Get their kid to school?

24:00.371 --> 24:01.570
Nope.

24:01.572 --> 24:03.304
You know why?

24:03.306 --> 24:05.340
They're too busy having fun.

24:05.342 --> 24:06.207
What is it I've been saying,

24:06.209 --> 24:08.676
for the love of God,
pick a side already.

24:08.678 --> 24:12.147
But I'm so gay I make
circles look straight.

24:12.149 --> 24:14.616
There's always been this
voice telling me that.

24:14.618 --> 24:19.487
You know, inside my head, I
just don't want to believe it.

24:19.489 --> 24:21.255
It's true.

24:21.257 --> 24:23.961
Dude, I use the ladies room.

24:25.963 --> 24:26.598
Right.

24:37.307 --> 24:40.474
Hey, how's everyone doing?

24:40.476 --> 24:42.410
That's
funny that you ask.

24:42.412 --> 24:44.245
I just wish everyone

24:44.247 --> 24:46.148
would care as much as I do!

24:46.150 --> 24:48.183
Don't act like
we're not sitting here

24:48.185 --> 24:49.553
with a bunch of hypocrites.

24:53.423 --> 24:55.991
Do not talk to us like that.

24:55.993 --> 24:58.296
Bruce, apologize to Erika.

25:01.230 --> 25:03.333
Y'all, snap it together!

25:04.301 --> 25:05.370
Get your lives.

25:06.536 --> 25:07.369
Do I have to remind you?

25:07.371 --> 25:09.737
This is not who we are.

25:09.739 --> 25:11.473
We're together because
no one else wants us

25:11.475 --> 25:13.308
and to make sure
we're there for others

25:13.310 --> 25:15.676
who don't have
anyone else either.

25:15.678 --> 25:19.414
Erika, honey, we know
you've gone through so much

25:19.416 --> 25:21.416
and have grown stronger for it.

25:21.418 --> 25:23.385
That's why we love you.

25:23.387 --> 25:28.223
Bruce, you keep your
close-minded hate to yourself.

25:28.225 --> 25:30.492
Miss Gina, Miss Rosa,

25:30.494 --> 25:33.294
you're doing a beautiful
thing with Chloe,

25:33.296 --> 25:36.999
but that blessing was
your choice, okay?

25:37.001 --> 25:37.635
Yeah.

25:39.236 --> 25:40.972
And Kyle, poor child,

25:42.473 --> 25:43.608
you are not gay.

25:45.575 --> 25:47.242
So let it go, boo boo.

25:47.244 --> 25:48.545
We still love you.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.582
All right, good.

25:53.449 --> 25:58.153
So, the numbers are in from
the car wash, and it's bad.

25:58.155 --> 25:59.788
It's like $130 bad.

25:59.790 --> 26:01.188
Uh-huh.

26:01.190 --> 26:02.323
But we washed like
a thousand cars!

26:02.325 --> 26:04.592
Yeah, we
charged $20 a pop!

26:04.594 --> 26:06.427
But after the
accident with lights

26:06.429 --> 26:08.362
and the sound system,
we didn't make enough.

26:08.364 --> 26:09.296
Kyle!

26:09.298 --> 26:11.332
I told you I didn't touch it.

26:11.334 --> 26:13.034
It's fine, it's okay.

26:13.036 --> 26:15.669
Everyone had fun and people
learned about the shelter,

26:15.671 --> 26:17.339
so that's good.

26:17.341 --> 26:20.375
We also have the 5k next
week, so that'll help.

26:20.377 --> 26:22.310
Speaking of which, after group

26:22.312 --> 26:25.515
I need help making
signs, any volunteers?

26:26.650 --> 26:30.121
Uh, I could, if
nobody else wanted to.

26:32.688 --> 26:33.524
Okay.

26:43.566 --> 26:45.801
Bruce kinda
told me you're not gay.

26:45.803 --> 26:46.637
Kind of?

26:49.273 --> 26:52.407
Well he mouthed it to
me at my first meeting.

26:53.476 --> 26:57.244
Well that man does too
many things with his mouth.

26:57.246 --> 26:58.082
So?

26:59.315 --> 27:00.485
No.

27:01.351 --> 27:02.216
Oh, no?

27:02.218 --> 27:03.520
Um-hmm.

27:05.488 --> 27:07.388
Then why the meetings?

27:07.390 --> 27:08.558
For support.

27:10.393 --> 27:13.195
Seems like you
do more than support.

27:13.197 --> 27:14.262
You kinda run the place.

27:14.264 --> 27:15.397
Yeah.

27:15.399 --> 27:17.368
How long have you lived here?

27:18.399 --> 27:19.504
I'm actually from here.

27:20.637 --> 27:23.772
Yeah, I um, just moved
back a few days ago.

27:23.774 --> 27:26.140
Well three years
ago, before me,

27:26.142 --> 27:30.145
there was another guy
that ran the group, Ryan.

27:30.147 --> 27:32.417
He was confident, handsome.

27:34.584 --> 27:37.551
Great with people, very gay.

27:37.553 --> 27:39.521
A little bit like you.

27:39.523 --> 27:41.590
The shelter was his dream.

27:41.592 --> 27:44.592
He would bring in homeless
teens off the street

27:44.594 --> 27:46.561
and try and get them
in at Good Shepherd,

27:46.563 --> 27:51.569
but their sponsors didn't want
the gays hurting their image.

27:52.736 --> 27:55.473
The image of a
homeless shelter.

27:56.707 --> 27:59.608
So he would take them
to the shelter in Orlando.

27:59.610 --> 28:02.343
Mark volunteers there sometimes.

28:02.345 --> 28:03.878
And then Ryan realized that

28:03.880 --> 28:06.148
there is enough gay youth here

28:06.150 --> 28:08.553
that we needed our own place.

28:09.453 --> 28:11.622
So what happened to him?

28:21.698 --> 28:25.402
One night he was
locking up after group,

28:30.541 --> 28:32.510
some guys jumped him.

28:34.945 --> 28:37.615
They found him the next morning.

28:39.949 --> 28:40.784
Beaten,

28:41.951 --> 28:44.788
and strangled with
a rainbow flag.

28:59.636 --> 29:01.203
He was my brother.

29:17.220 --> 29:18.688
That's why I'm here.

29:21.291 --> 29:23.226
To make his dream real.

29:33.769 --> 29:34.604
You know?

29:39.610 --> 29:40.945
Bruce was right.

29:42.713 --> 29:44.482
You are kinda cute.

29:46.550 --> 29:47.715
What?

29:47.717 --> 29:49.887
It's too bad you're gay.

29:53.422 --> 29:55.790
Excuse me?

29:55.792 --> 29:58.627
You're just so refreshing.

29:58.629 --> 30:00.262
So many new people feel the need

30:00.264 --> 30:02.800
to overemphasize
their sexuality.

30:04.700 --> 30:08.639
What I love about you is
you don't have to try,

30:09.605 --> 30:12.309
your gayness just
flows naturally.

30:15.579 --> 30:19.446
Do you have any idea
what I would do to you

30:19.448 --> 30:20.548
if you were straight?

30:28.624 --> 30:31.659
Your gayness flows naturally?

30:34.765 --> 30:38.399
Not funny man, they
think that I'm gay!

30:38.401 --> 30:39.667
All of them?

30:39.669 --> 30:41.569
Apparently, something about

30:41.571 --> 30:43.737
not having to
force my sexuality.

30:44.807 --> 30:47.775
Look Dave, this
is a good thing.

30:47.777 --> 30:50.078
They trust you now, you
gotta keep 'em trusting you.

30:56.386 --> 30:57.686
What?

30:57.688 --> 31:00.621
They want me to go to some
place called The Closet.

31:03.627 --> 31:05.493
It's a gay bar, Dave.

31:05.495 --> 31:07.529
A very classy place.

31:07.531 --> 31:08.432
Phenomenal.

31:10.734 --> 31:12.099
Should I go?

31:12.101 --> 31:14.802
Absolutely, the door
is wide open, Dave.

31:14.804 --> 31:16.937
Get in there and strike.

31:16.939 --> 31:18.807
You be careful okay?

31:18.809 --> 31:21.642
Make sure you bottle up that
natural gayness of yours.

31:50.841 --> 31:52.709
You look so handsome.

31:54.777 --> 31:56.079
Just like Frank.

32:03.687 --> 32:04.522
Perfect.

32:06.156 --> 32:09.456
First
date since Samantha?

32:09.458 --> 32:10.760
It's not a date.

32:11.861 --> 32:13.927
Don't come back fore 10.

32:13.929 --> 32:17.634
You might see something
you don't want to.

32:36.820 --> 32:39.123
Yep, looks pretty gay to me.

32:45.928 --> 32:47.561
Hey.

32:47.563 --> 32:48.929
Hey.

32:48.931 --> 32:52.099
Wow, you really clean up nicely.

32:52.101 --> 32:53.635
Thanks.

32:53.637 --> 32:55.806
You are... also wearing clothes.

32:57.841 --> 32:59.107
Yeah, you like?

32:59.109 --> 33:01.909
That scarf though.

33:01.911 --> 33:02.746
- No.
- Uh.

33:04.948 --> 33:06.781
I'm glad you came out tonight.

33:06.783 --> 33:09.516
Yeah, uh, and thanks
for inviting me.

33:09.518 --> 33:12.821
I haven't really been out since

33:12.823 --> 33:14.824
Sam... left me for a woman.

33:16.159 --> 33:17.559
He did?

33:17.561 --> 33:18.396
Oh, Dave.

33:19.662 --> 33:20.897
Yep, a woman.

33:21.832 --> 33:23.865
Two timing man-whore.

33:23.867 --> 33:24.702
Mm-hmm.

33:25.901 --> 33:29.471
I don't know, I guess
I took it pretty bad.

33:30.841 --> 33:32.874
I feel like I must not
have been enough man

33:32.876 --> 33:36.881
to leave Sam the only
choice of switching sides.

33:38.547 --> 33:40.482
Most days are okay though,

33:40.484 --> 33:44.053
but then all it takes
is seeing an old photo,

33:45.721 --> 33:48.923
or I could be at a
movie and reach over,

33:48.925 --> 33:51.462
but realize there's no hand.

33:54.563 --> 33:57.732
Ah I just wish I
could hold your hand

33:57.734 --> 33:59.069
one more time, Sama...

34:01.036 --> 34:01.838
man.

34:03.806 --> 34:05.706
Sam-a-man, I used to
call him Sam-a-man

34:05.708 --> 34:08.208
because he was so much man.

34:10.545 --> 34:11.612
Good evening Alyssa.

34:11.614 --> 34:12.946
Hi, Jason.

34:12.947 --> 34:14.916
Here you go.

34:21.992 --> 34:22.958

34:43.079 --> 34:44.945

35:14.144 --> 35:15.242
They don't mind?

35:15.244 --> 35:17.044
No, they don't mind as long

35:17.046 --> 35:19.981
as I follow the
straight girl rules.

35:19.983 --> 35:22.119
My vagina has no power here.

35:23.753 --> 35:25.086
I mean the straight girls are
used to getting free drinks

35:25.088 --> 35:26.854
and being the center
of attention at bars.

35:26.856 --> 35:29.090

that around midnight
that's when the party

35:35.365 --> 35:37.267
can get a little crazy.

35:39.102 --> 35:41.572
How crazy are we talking?

35:42.872 --> 35:43.974
You'll see.

should ever see.

35:53.883 --> 35:54.948
Disturbing stuff.

35:54.950 --> 35:57.184
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

35:57.186 --> 36:00.954
And then Frank, that
old dirty bastard.

36:00.956 --> 36:02.990
He was downstairs laughing.

36:02.992 --> 36:04.325
Yeah.

36:04.327 --> 36:06.093
I'll never look at my Aunt
Patty the same way again.

36:06.095 --> 36:07.260

36:09.999 --> 36:13.100
is what she is.

36:13.102 --> 36:15.003
I didn't want to
move in with her.

36:15.005 --> 36:17.104
I had no choice,
I lost everything.

36:17.106 --> 36:18.773
Well, you can always
move with me, I mean.

37:40.923 --> 37:42.423
And I was just drunk.

37:42.425 --> 37:45.796
Drunk and dancing
like really dancing.

37:47.296 --> 37:49.262
Okay, I
am putting the brakes

37:49.264 --> 37:52.066
on this thing right now.

37:52.068 --> 37:54.801
What if we're
wrong about them?

37:54.803 --> 37:56.206
Wrong about them?

37:59.342 --> 38:01.441
Who am I talking to right now?

38:01.443 --> 38:02.544
Not Dave Hopper.

38:04.314 --> 38:08.182
Not the guy who's world was
ripped apart by their agenda.

38:08.184 --> 38:11.785
Not the guy who's wife was
seduced by another woman

38:11.787 --> 38:13.988
and ruined his practice.

38:13.990 --> 38:17.057
Totally destroyed his chance
of a normal, fulfilling life!

38:20.130 --> 38:22.800
I wanna talk to that Dave, okay?

38:24.032 --> 38:25.867
'Cause I'm in his corner, buddy.

38:25.869 --> 38:27.401
I can give him another chance.

38:27.403 --> 38:30.240
When he shows up,
you let me know.

38:31.206 --> 38:33.309
'Cause I'm ready to help.

38:34.410 --> 38:35.245
All right?

38:39.148 --> 38:41.215
Just not sure we're
doing the right thing.

38:41.217 --> 38:43.820
Sweet creeping Judas, Dave.

38:45.555 --> 38:48.222
Stop going to the
group, stay sober,

38:48.224 --> 38:51.191
get a grip on your
class and on yourself.

38:51.193 --> 38:52.228
Okay?

38:53.463 --> 38:54.298
Okay.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.345
You ready for this?

39:12.347 --> 39:13.814
The 5K?

39:13.816 --> 39:15.416
No, the shelter.

39:15.418 --> 39:16.883
Huge job.

39:16.885 --> 39:21.021
You know, operations,
reports, finances.

39:21.023 --> 39:22.289
One thing to own a property,

39:22.291 --> 39:24.225
another thing to keep
it running long term.

39:24.227 --> 39:25.859
You know? You're right.

39:25.861 --> 39:26.497
I am?

39:28.363 --> 39:30.463
Yeah, we don't really
have that experience.

39:30.465 --> 39:34.270
Well, better to be
honest about that now.

39:35.137 --> 39:36.973
Maybe we should just...

39:38.073 --> 39:39.941
Field trip.

39:39.943 --> 39:40.874
A what?

39:40.876 --> 39:42.142
Field trip.

39:42.144 --> 39:44.579
Mark volunteers at the
shelter in Orlando.

39:44.581 --> 39:47.113
He could take us all
there, show us around,

39:47.115 --> 39:48.349
show us how it's done.

39:48.351 --> 39:49.450
Give us a tour.

39:49.452 --> 39:51.586
Great idea Dave!

39:51.588 --> 39:52.421
Bloop.

39:54.057 --> 39:55.425
You betta' stretch.

39:57.093 --> 39:58.859
Good morning, everyone.

40:00.597 --> 40:02.195
Oh, you look amazing.

40:02.197 --> 40:03.330
Are you ready to do this?

40:03.332 --> 40:04.332
Yeah!

40:04.334 --> 40:05.365
All right, let's count down.

40:05.367 --> 40:07.300
All together, here we go, ready.

43:23.265 --> 43:24.432
Yeah, a little bit.

43:34.543 --> 43:36.309
This is the zebra house,

43:36.311 --> 43:39.345
where "sexually
unacceptable" teens go

43:39.347 --> 43:43.383
when their parents or
God kicks them out.

43:43.385 --> 43:45.452
I'm intersex, it means

43:45.454 --> 43:48.222
I'm not biologically
male or female.

43:48.224 --> 43:51.158
My insides are kind of a mix up.

43:51.160 --> 43:53.794
But I was raised in
the Christian church

43:53.796 --> 43:56.229
and I get to hear
all these sermons

43:56.231 --> 43:57.700
about man and woman.

44:00.702 --> 44:03.771
When I'm not strictly either.

44:03.773 --> 44:05.472
I identify as gender-fluid,

44:05.474 --> 44:08.475
which means that I believe
that I am both male and female.

44:08.477 --> 44:11.278
I didn't fit into
the exact binary

44:11.280 --> 44:12.512
that people thought I should.

44:12.514 --> 44:15.448
That my mom thought I fit into.

44:15.450 --> 44:17.753
That physically I should have.

44:19.287 --> 44:21.454
The first time that I thought
something was different,

44:21.456 --> 44:23.323
I was probably about nine.

44:23.325 --> 44:25.693
I was in Catholic school
since I was five years old.

44:25.695 --> 44:29.562
Actually got kicked out
for coming out as gay

44:29.564 --> 44:31.298
at that point in my life.

44:31.300 --> 44:33.466
When I was 11, I used
to fight with my mom

44:33.468 --> 44:35.169
about wanting to wear
my brother's clothes

44:35.171 --> 44:36.336
'cause I had four brothers.

44:36.338 --> 44:38.405
I have seven siblings.

44:38.407 --> 44:40.407
I knew back then that
something about me

44:40.409 --> 44:42.343
was way more masculine
than just feminine.

44:42.345 --> 44:44.144
People ask me, they're
like oh, so you're gay

44:44.146 --> 44:46.579
and I'm like no, not gay.

44:46.581 --> 44:49.182
It's always one of the
first questions I get

44:49.184 --> 44:53.620
or the normal question of "What
do you have in your pants?"

44:53.622 --> 44:56.289
I just kind of roll my
eyes and I answer people.

44:56.291 --> 44:57.791
I'm like what does
it matter though?

44:57.793 --> 45:02.495
My family aren't as
loving as they say they are.

45:02.497 --> 45:06.566
Even though they say that
they do not judge others

45:06.568 --> 45:10.236
and they love thy neighbor,
that might be true,

45:10.238 --> 45:12.773
but just not when it's
in the family, you know?

45:12.775 --> 45:16.546
I used to cry out to
God and ask him why,

45:17.880 --> 45:20.414
why did, if he formed
me in the womb,

45:20.416 --> 45:23.850
why did he choose to
form me in this way.

45:23.852 --> 45:25.818
My mother has allowed
me back into her house,

45:25.820 --> 45:28.555
but she's like I don't
care if you like girls,

45:28.557 --> 45:30.823
just don't be someone
who's transgender.

45:30.825 --> 45:33.260
Just don't mess with
your gender, you know.

45:33.262 --> 45:34.794
That's how God made you.

45:34.796 --> 45:38.265
You've already proven
that something's wrong

45:38.267 --> 45:40.568
by liking the same sex.

45:40.570 --> 45:43.537
This person that
I am, Christina

45:43.539 --> 45:45.673
isn't this body,
it's me, it's a voice

45:45.675 --> 45:49.510
that I hope can
speak to this world.

45:49.512 --> 45:50.945
I love my mother, though.

45:50.947 --> 45:53.713
She is a wonderful woman.

45:53.715 --> 45:54.782
I think the world of her

45:54.784 --> 45:56.850
and I'll always love my mommy.

45:56.852 --> 45:58.885
Even if she doesn't want me
to call her mommy one day.

46:01.691 --> 46:04.258
Just have a hard time
having to sit around

46:04.260 --> 46:06.327
with my family as
they're all happy

46:06.329 --> 46:07.861
with one another
and knowing that

46:07.863 --> 46:09.562
they don't feel
that way about me.

46:09.564 --> 46:12.533
Not knowing what they say
about me when I'm not around.

46:12.535 --> 46:14.468
What does my mom tell her
friends and her family

46:14.470 --> 46:15.669
that I'm doing?

46:15.671 --> 46:18.372
I learned that she doesn't even
tell 'em that I'm homeless.

46:18.374 --> 46:20.573
I wonder what my mom
tells all her friends.

46:20.575 --> 46:24.611
I wonder what's her
idea of a perfect child.

46:24.613 --> 46:28.349
And I wish that I was good
enough to be that child

46:28.351 --> 46:30.820
worth just telling people about.

46:32.454 --> 46:35.858
I just come to hang out
on nights and weekends.

46:38.394 --> 46:40.727
This is, this is the only place

46:40.729 --> 46:44.333
where I feel like I
have a voice, you know?

46:45.601 --> 46:47.537
Like I actually matter.

46:56.646 --> 46:57.479
I'm sorry.

47:07.389 --> 47:08.490
Nate, Nate.

47:09.858 --> 47:11.725
What are you doing here?

47:11.727 --> 47:13.994
Were you following me?

47:13.996 --> 47:14.831
No.

47:15.831 --> 47:18.731
So you're here with them.

47:18.733 --> 47:21.401
How's that gonna look
to the administration?

47:21.403 --> 47:24.707
Look, you can't tell
anybody I was here.

47:26.309 --> 47:27.640
Is that really what
you came out here to say?

47:27.642 --> 47:29.776
Why am I gonna tell them, huh?

47:29.778 --> 47:32.445
Oh hey, Dr. Woodman, I was
at my afternoon gay house

47:32.447 --> 47:34.648
when your puppet came visiting.

47:34.650 --> 47:36.716
Oh why were you at
that gay house, Nate?

47:36.718 --> 47:38.255
Because I'm gay.

47:39.722 --> 47:41.424
Yeah, I'd be done.

47:42.624 --> 47:43.590
We could help you.

47:43.592 --> 47:45.658
Help, seriously?

47:45.660 --> 47:47.695
I've heard a month of your help.

47:47.697 --> 47:49.530
No thank you.

47:49.532 --> 47:50.763
And you know what, don't worry.

47:50.765 --> 47:53.633
I'm not gonna tell anyone
your little secret.

47:53.635 --> 47:54.901
Can't have anyone knowing

47:54.903 --> 47:57.937
you've been spending time
with the unforgivable.

47:57.939 --> 47:58.775
Nate.

47:59.709 --> 48:00.744
Nate!

48:04.680 --> 48:05.849
I had no idea.

48:07.682 --> 48:09.451
Why would you, huh?

48:10.820 --> 48:14.691
All you do is answer the
questions, you never ask any.

48:16.124 --> 48:19.059
I don't have any
answers right now.

48:19.061 --> 48:20.430
But I think...

48:22.731 --> 48:25.865
You know what, I don't
know what to think either.

48:25.867 --> 48:27.336
But this place,

48:29.003 --> 48:32.708
it's good and I feel
like you should stay.

48:34.843 --> 48:37.746
Call from
Hot Sweet Muffin.

48:38.847 --> 48:40.079
That's rather inappropriate.

48:40.081 --> 48:41.414
Call from

48:41.416 --> 48:42.149
Hot Sweet Muffin.
And gross.

48:42.151 --> 48:44.354
It's coming from your pocket.

48:45.820 --> 48:49.523
Call from
Hot Sweet Muffin.

48:49.525 --> 48:50.760
It's my aunt.

48:51.593 --> 48:52.792
Hello?

49:00.903 --> 49:04.470
Patty, I told you, you
need to take it easy.

49:04.472 --> 49:05.773
You know a hug
would go a lot further

49:05.775 --> 49:06.974
than words right now.

49:06.976 --> 49:10.711
You don't understand,
she's just always...

49:10.713 --> 49:11.611
You know what, nevermind.

49:11.613 --> 49:14.782
This girl doesn't
know how to have fun.

49:14.784 --> 49:17.517
Every time she thinks
it's an emergency.

49:17.519 --> 49:21.824
Well look, Patty, take it
easy, get some rest, okay?

49:23.526 --> 49:24.527
Thank you.

49:28.731 --> 49:30.597
The paramedic said
you passed out!

49:30.599 --> 49:31.865
You all right?

49:31.867 --> 49:34.801
Tell me something
great you did today.

49:34.803 --> 49:37.537
Today has not been great.

49:37.539 --> 49:40.876
Bull shit, tell me
then a small great.

49:42.510 --> 49:43.477
Learned a new game.

49:44.713 --> 49:47.448
Ah good, will
you teach it to me?

49:47.450 --> 49:48.916
No.

49:48.918 --> 49:50.519
Oh it sounds bad.

49:52.153 --> 49:55.823
What were you doing
when you got the call?

49:55.825 --> 49:59.892
I was unraveling a
bandage and pouring salt

49:59.894 --> 50:02.131
into student's deepest wound.

50:04.767 --> 50:07.934
Have you seen my silk flowers?

50:07.936 --> 50:09.836
You can't miss 'em.

50:09.838 --> 50:13.506
I had Frank plant
them years ago.

50:14.175 --> 50:15.843
For the emphysema?

50:15.845 --> 50:17.711
Just wanted my flower beds

50:17.713 --> 50:20.079
to look beautiful all year long,

50:20.081 --> 50:22.716
no matter the season.

50:22.718 --> 50:24.917
Except they look fake.

50:24.919 --> 50:27.921
Most people go
their whole lives,

50:27.923 --> 50:29.923
thinking they can
be silk flowers.

50:31.593 --> 50:33.896
They love the beauty of summer

50:35.965 --> 50:40.669
without the growth of spring,
and the death of winter,

50:41.903 --> 50:43.907
or the doubts of fall.

50:51.646 --> 50:52.845
My favorite part is the line

50:52.847 --> 50:54.948
where the black and white meet.

50:54.950 --> 50:59.553
It's clear, it's obvious,
there's no gray and no doubt.

50:59.555 --> 51:02.155
I'm not so sure
doubt's such a bad thing.

51:02.157 --> 51:04.057
I'm late for class.

51:04.059 --> 51:05.925
So why don't I join you.

51:08.597 --> 51:09.930
Good morning, everyone.

51:09.932 --> 51:12.131
Carry on.

51:12.133 --> 51:12.968
Hi.

51:14.836 --> 51:15.936
Morning, everyone.

51:15.938 --> 51:17.907
Morning.

51:19.140 --> 51:23.012
Let's continue with
Behavioral Psychology.

51:24.914 --> 51:27.584
What about the question today?

51:29.785 --> 51:31.087
Right, question.

51:33.289 --> 51:34.720
Who's got a...

51:34.722 --> 51:37.724
How is the gay thing
different from slavery?

51:37.726 --> 51:39.662
Or oppression of women?

51:40.896 --> 51:42.595
I'm sorry?

51:42.597 --> 51:45.765
The Bible has been used to
support both of those things.

51:45.767 --> 51:48.001
Before the Civil War,
slavery was supported

51:48.003 --> 51:49.870
by white pastors
saying that slaves

51:49.872 --> 51:52.606
should respect their masters.

51:52.608 --> 51:54.006
And men have always
used the new testament

51:54.008 --> 51:57.611
to keep women silent
in the church.

51:57.613 --> 52:00.012
How do we know that
homosexuality is different

52:00.014 --> 52:03.050
than these things the church
used to support with Scripture?

52:03.052 --> 52:05.318
Nate, these are
complicated issues.

52:05.320 --> 52:07.287
Now, pardon me.

52:07.289 --> 52:08.825
Um, Nate, is it?

52:10.258 --> 52:11.691
Yeah.

52:11.693 --> 52:14.894
Nate, you are
absolutely right.

52:14.896 --> 52:17.030
The Bible has been
misused time and again

52:17.032 --> 52:18.966
to justify racism, slavery,

52:18.968 --> 52:21.767
and the oppression of women,
even calling it God's work

52:21.769 --> 52:24.671
and that is shameful,
absolutely shameful.

52:24.673 --> 52:25.872
All right?

52:25.874 --> 52:30.077
But as you start to
closely study scripture,

52:30.079 --> 52:34.180
you're gonna find that there
has always been this tension,

52:34.182 --> 52:37.617
this opposing narrative that
actually calls for women

52:37.619 --> 52:39.753
to be in leadership
and denounces slavery

52:39.755 --> 52:42.088
as contrary to God's will.

52:42.090 --> 52:43.724
Dig in there, read it closely,

52:43.726 --> 52:46.258
you are gonna find
it, I promise you.

52:46.260 --> 52:49.162
However, even though some
people try to bend scripture

52:49.164 --> 52:50.696
to fit their own
personal beliefs,

52:50.698 --> 52:53.867
there is no narrative anywhere

52:53.869 --> 52:56.035
in the Bible that
affirms homosexuality

52:56.037 --> 52:59.171
or calls it anything
other than a sin.

52:59.173 --> 53:03.042
But love is the ultimate message
of the Scriptures, right?

53:03.044 --> 53:04.747
Uh-huh.

53:05.881 --> 53:08.215
If we love, then
aren't we kinda stuck

53:08.217 --> 53:10.586
affirming our gay friends?

53:11.820 --> 53:14.655
Okay.

53:14.657 --> 53:19.126
Nate, we have certainly
made plenty of mistakes,

53:19.128 --> 53:22.095
and gays who think
they're Christians

53:22.097 --> 53:23.997
have suffered at the
hands of the Church.

53:23.999 --> 53:27.066
Which many times has failed

53:27.068 --> 53:28.137
to treat them

53:29.070 --> 53:30.606
with compassion,

53:33.374 --> 53:36.175
but we all know that God's
ways are best, right?

53:36.177 --> 53:38.711
We agree on that, we believe it.

53:38.713 --> 53:40.983
And the greatest expression

53:41.849 --> 53:42.918
of God's love

53:45.019 --> 53:47.055
is to speak his truth.

53:49.457 --> 53:50.660
Case closed.

53:52.093 --> 53:53.695
Have a blessed day.

54:00.968 --> 54:02.301
Okay.

54:02.303 --> 54:05.407
So what's important
to remember here.

54:07.041 --> 54:08.810
Nate, what are you...

54:09.811 --> 54:10.646
Nate.

54:33.135 --> 54:35.068
Hey guys, Rosa and
I wanna invite you

54:35.070 --> 54:36.903
to Chloe's birthday
party on Saturday.

54:36.905 --> 54:38.838
It's over on that new
place at Clompton,

54:38.840 --> 54:41.841
with the weird
inflatable things.

54:41.843 --> 54:44.211
Hey, are you sure you
want a bunch of old folks

54:44.213 --> 54:46.278
attending her 10th
birthday party?

54:46.280 --> 54:48.080
Her friends will
be there, too,

54:48.082 --> 54:49.749
but when we asked
who she wanted,

54:49.751 --> 54:52.486
she said her 2nd family
and that would be you guys.

54:52.488 --> 54:54.086
Please say you'll come.

54:54.088 --> 54:55.521
Of course, we'd be honored.

54:55.523 --> 54:56.358
Thank you.

54:57.526 --> 54:59.361
Okay, now to business.

55:00.863 --> 55:01.794
We are not even close.

55:01.796 --> 55:04.099
We need 32,000 in two weeks.

55:05.133 --> 55:07.200
So time to brainstorm.

55:07.202 --> 55:09.135
Give me what you got,
there are no bad ideas.

55:09.137 --> 55:10.370
Hey, listen to this.

55:10.372 --> 55:12.138
We find the biggest
church in town,

55:12.140 --> 55:15.108
we have a huge bake sale
in front of their doors,

55:15.110 --> 55:18.211
we all wear T-shirts
that say "Youth Group."

55:18.213 --> 55:20.113
All right, I mean
who's gonna know?

55:20.948 --> 55:22.182
I was wrong.

55:22.184 --> 55:23.182
No.

55:23.184 --> 55:24.950
What about a
town hall meeting?

55:24.952 --> 55:28.254
You know a chance to tell
people why we need this,

55:28.256 --> 55:29.823
how it's gonna help.

55:29.825 --> 55:31.390
We could set up a open mic,

55:31.392 --> 55:34.026
give people the opportunity
to voice their opinion.

55:34.028 --> 55:37.164
So they can tell us
they hate us to our faces.

55:37.166 --> 55:39.265
I don't know about that.

55:39.267 --> 55:40.432
Oh I don't know, I
think we have more support

55:40.434 --> 55:42.001
than you think.

55:42.003 --> 55:44.171
Yeah, we're running
out of options here.

55:44.173 --> 55:45.372
This could work.

55:45.374 --> 55:47.874
We can do a silent
auction at the same time.

55:47.876 --> 55:49.809
Yeah, I mean if we're
going to hear hater's hate,

55:49.811 --> 55:52.312
we might as well
take their money too.

55:52.314 --> 55:54.481
Are you sure you
can handle that?

55:54.483 --> 55:56.582
I don't think
we have a choice.

56:19.006 --> 56:19.842
Hey.

56:22.177 --> 56:25.312

57:14.229 --> 57:16.162
- Let's go, c'mon.
- Oh.

57:16.164 --> 57:20.468
Yeah, come with mommy.

57:21.570 --> 57:23.403
This was perfect.

57:23.405 --> 57:24.240
Thank you.

57:26.240 --> 57:28.076
Yeah, you want more?

57:29.244 --> 57:31.211
No, I can't have any more.

57:31.213 --> 57:34.217
But I have to go
to the ladies room.

57:38.452 --> 57:39.285
You got it?

57:39.287 --> 57:40.923
Mm-hmm.

57:41.956 --> 57:43.258
That's bullshit.

57:44.425 --> 57:46.593
Are you kidding me?

57:46.595 --> 57:49.365
And they're just
telling you now?

57:50.264 --> 57:53.068
No, it's just, it's just wrong.

57:55.403 --> 57:57.504
Well, we are gonna work it out.

57:57.506 --> 58:00.506
And we're gonna find
something even better.

58:00.508 --> 58:03.309
Of course, love you, too.

58:03.311 --> 58:04.346
Bye.

58:05.447 --> 58:07.414
Didn't sound good.

58:07.416 --> 58:08.715
Nope.

58:08.717 --> 58:11.283
The inflatable place just
canceled Chloe's party!

58:11.285 --> 58:12.718
No!

58:12.720 --> 58:15.254
Yeah, the whole
bullshit about not wanting

58:15.256 --> 58:17.557
to support that lifestyle.

58:17.559 --> 58:19.693
You do have friends.

58:20.528 --> 58:22.128
Yeah.

58:22.130 --> 58:26.166
Patty, this is Alyssa,
Alyssa, my aunt Patty.

58:26.168 --> 58:27.733
Hot Sweet Muffin.

58:27.735 --> 58:29.202
So nice to meet you.

58:29.204 --> 58:31.070
It's nice meeting you.

58:31.072 --> 58:32.671
Is everything okay?

58:32.673 --> 58:34.409
Uh, not really, um,

58:36.177 --> 58:37.676
some of my friends,
well our friends

58:37.678 --> 58:39.678
just found out their
daughter's birthday party

58:39.680 --> 58:40.747
has just been canceled.

58:40.749 --> 58:42.148
Oh why?

58:42.150 --> 58:43.983
A location thing.

58:43.985 --> 58:46.218
Well she can have
it at my house.

58:46.220 --> 58:47.354
- Really?
- Uh-uh.

58:47.356 --> 58:49.088
- Yes.
- I wouldn't wanna impose.

58:49.090 --> 58:50.490
Oh we have a big house.

58:50.492 --> 58:51.691
It's not real big.

58:51.693 --> 58:53.559
That's great,
they'll be thrilled!

58:53.561 --> 58:55.195
How many people can you take?

58:55.197 --> 58:56.262
Three, four.

58:56.264 --> 58:57.731
Everyone!

58:57.733 --> 58:59.733
I love parties!

58:59.735 --> 59:00.700
Okay great, we will
bring everyone then.

59:00.702 --> 59:02.571
- All of you.
- Thank you.

59:03.505 --> 59:06.171
This is huge, I appreciate it.

59:06.173 --> 59:08.443
Hey guys, sorry I'm late.

59:09.577 --> 59:10.412
All right.

59:11.613 --> 59:14.483
Nate, what do you
got for me today?

59:21.590 --> 59:23.292
Anybody seen Nate?

59:27.628 --> 59:28.630
Where is he?

59:30.032 --> 59:31.731
Hi Dave, how are you?

59:31.733 --> 59:33.332
Where is he?

59:33.334 --> 59:34.800
Where's who?

59:34.802 --> 59:36.269
Nate.

59:36.271 --> 59:39.571
Nate is no longer
with us at Lakeside.

59:39.573 --> 59:42.274
Don't tell me you didn't know.

59:42.276 --> 59:45.245
He can't be here, all right?

59:45.247 --> 59:47.613
How can we help
him by ignoring him?

59:47.615 --> 59:50.716
We're not ignoring him
Dave, we're confronting him

59:50.718 --> 59:52.484
with his need to change.

59:52.486 --> 59:56.222
Oh for heaven's sake, look,
you've lost sight of the truth.

59:56.224 --> 59:59.291
I told you to stop
going to the group.

59:59.293 --> 01:00:01.528
You've already done
plenty of damage.

01:00:17.678 --> 01:00:20.213
No.

01:00:20.215 --> 01:00:21.180
Wait!

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:21.814
Wait!

01:00:21.816 --> 01:00:22.749
Wait!

01:00:22.751 --> 01:00:24.350
Wait, wait!

01:00:26.521 --> 01:00:29.655
Come on.

01:00:29.657 --> 01:00:33.792
You know this is
a children's party, right?

01:00:36.164 --> 01:00:38.298
Doesn't have to be.

01:01:10.264 --> 01:01:11.497
Perfect, thank you.

01:01:11.499 --> 01:01:12.501
Oh.

01:01:17.838 --> 01:01:21.508
Hey, I, um, give you a heads
up about my Aunt Patty.

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:22.809
So excited to meet her!

01:01:22.811 --> 01:01:23.642
No.

01:01:23.644 --> 01:01:25.611
Yes I am.

01:01:25.613 --> 01:01:28.515
What I mean is she's kinda
up there in age, ya know?

01:01:28.517 --> 01:01:30.219
- Not really...
- Woo.

01:01:32.586 --> 01:01:33.421
With us.

01:01:34.856 --> 01:01:37.325
Girl, you look beautiful!

01:01:38.193 --> 01:01:39.459
You must be Patty.

01:01:39.461 --> 01:01:41.193
Thank you.

01:01:41.195 --> 01:01:42.662
This is a gift.

01:01:42.664 --> 01:01:44.329
Sorry I'm late.

01:01:44.331 --> 01:01:48.470
That fudge packer at the
grocery store took forever.

01:01:51.539 --> 01:01:53.338
They're here, come on.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.407
Oh come
on, Miss Patty!

01:01:54.409 --> 01:01:56.876
Don't get your vintage
Chenille all snagged up, girl.

01:01:56.878 --> 01:01:58.410
What is he doing here?

01:01:58.412 --> 01:01:59.546
I needed my uppers!

01:01:59.548 --> 01:02:00.412
Shh!

01:02:00.414 --> 01:02:01.213
Sorry.

01:02:01.215 --> 01:02:01.780
Girl.

01:02:01.782 --> 01:02:02.617
Sorry.

01:02:04.552 --> 01:02:06.619
Okay guys, remember this was
thrown together last minute,

01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:08.354
so we have to appreciate
what we have, okay?

01:02:08.356 --> 01:02:09.658
Okay.

01:02:11.258 --> 01:02:12.291
Surprise!

01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:17.532
You guys!

01:02:18.465 --> 01:02:19.666
This is too much.

01:02:19.668 --> 01:02:21.633
This is just right.

Chloe?

01:04:31.066 --> 01:04:32.765
Your town
hall meeting is a go.

01:04:32.767 --> 01:04:34.767
It's Friday night at my church.

01:04:34.769 --> 01:04:35.803
Really?

01:04:37.104 --> 01:04:40.640
I thought that was
kind of a bad idea.

01:04:40.642 --> 01:04:41.807
People might not like you

01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:44.644
shoving the gay
agenda in their face.

01:04:44.646 --> 01:04:47.650
Seriously, the
radical gay agenda?

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:52.718
The only agenda I have
is to love the unloved.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.421
Those kids who get
kicked out of their homes

01:04:55.423 --> 01:04:58.994
in the name of religion
or moral superiority.

01:05:00.595 --> 01:05:04.030
They don't even know
what love looks like.

01:05:04.032 --> 01:05:08.800
They're labeled an outsider,
or a queer, or worse.

01:05:08.802 --> 01:05:10.102
I like to imagine
what would be possible

01:05:10.104 --> 01:05:13.842
if we chose to love
rather than label people.

01:05:19.481 --> 01:05:20.847
He did these himself?

01:05:20.849 --> 01:05:23.483
He and his ex
did them together.

01:05:23.485 --> 01:05:27.055
Oh, well they'd look
great with some color.

01:05:28.389 --> 01:05:29.655
I thought you left.

01:05:29.657 --> 01:05:30.756
Oh, I was going
to, but Aunt Patty

01:05:30.758 --> 01:05:32.524
invited me to stay for dinner.

01:05:32.526 --> 01:05:35.595
Isn't
that be nice, Dave?

01:05:35.597 --> 01:05:36.899
Yeah, very nice.

01:05:38.099 --> 01:05:40.800
Could I borrow you
real quick, Patty?

01:05:40.802 --> 01:05:42.604
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

01:05:44.671 --> 01:05:45.771
What are you doing?

01:05:45.773 --> 01:05:46.638
I've seen the way

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.573
- you look at her.
- Shh.

01:05:48.575 --> 01:05:50.776
It's not a good time, okay?

01:05:50.778 --> 01:05:52.010
It's complicated.

01:05:52.012 --> 01:05:53.111
Samantha?

01:05:53.113 --> 01:05:55.481
Don't say her name, please.

01:05:55.483 --> 01:05:56.118
Ooh.

01:05:57.718 --> 01:05:59.419
She's a lesbian!

01:05:59.421 --> 01:06:01.653
Look at how
progressive I am,

01:06:01.655 --> 01:06:04.189
having a lesbian for dinner!

01:06:04.191 --> 01:06:05.992
Or does she swing both ways?

01:06:05.994 --> 01:06:09.832
Isn't that what you young
men like these days?

01:06:16.137 --> 01:06:20.441
So, Aunt Patty, Frank
seems like quite a catch.

01:06:21.476 --> 01:06:22.945
He keeps me young.

01:06:24.211 --> 01:06:25.945
You two ever hook up?

01:06:25.947 --> 01:06:27.814
Oh, no.

01:06:27.816 --> 01:06:28.780
We do have sex though.

01:06:30.151 --> 01:06:32.154
This was a great idea.

01:06:36.957 --> 01:06:39.492
Dave never told me you
could cook like this.

01:06:39.494 --> 01:06:40.129
Dave.

01:06:41.496 --> 01:06:42.928
I don't talk about
my personal life.

01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:44.930
He talks in his sleep, though.

01:06:44.932 --> 01:06:46.097
You should hear him
talk about Sam...

01:06:46.099 --> 01:06:47.867
Patty.

01:06:47.869 --> 01:06:49.001
Uh-mm.

01:06:49.003 --> 01:06:52.571
Okay, we won't talk about Sam.

01:06:52.573 --> 01:06:55.707
Oh, how long have you
two known each other?

01:06:55.709 --> 01:06:57.809
Um, we've known each
other a few weeks.

01:06:57.811 --> 01:06:59.879
No, I meant you and Saman...

01:06:59.881 --> 01:07:00.716
Mm.

01:07:01.648 --> 01:07:03.182
This broccoli is so good.

01:07:03.184 --> 01:07:04.584
No, I've never met Sam.

01:07:04.586 --> 01:07:06.151
Just know what little
Dave has told me.

01:07:06.153 --> 01:07:08.887
Oh, I thought by the
way you said the name,

01:07:08.889 --> 01:07:09.821
that you had known h...

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.091
Broccoli.

01:07:13.093 --> 01:07:15.561
No, never net him.

01:07:27.941 --> 01:07:28.941
I don't,

01:07:28.943 --> 01:07:29.876
I don't think,

01:07:29.878 --> 01:07:31.843
I don't think that's how you...

01:07:33.747 --> 01:07:36.885
Got it.

01:07:43.023 --> 01:07:43.958
You okay?

01:07:45.793 --> 01:07:48.193
They were such a sweet couple.

01:07:48.195 --> 01:07:51.597
And then that tramp
ripped Dave's heart

01:07:51.599 --> 01:07:54.867
right out of his chest
and pounded on it.

01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:03.975
Genius.

01:08:03.977 --> 01:08:05.278
What'd I do?

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:08.180
No, the silk flowers,
they always stay colorful.

01:08:08.182 --> 01:08:10.850
Oh yeah, something
about the emphysema,

01:08:10.852 --> 01:08:11.850
real ones make it worse.

01:08:13.988 --> 01:08:15.657
I love that woman.

01:08:16.957 --> 01:08:18.122
You're lucky to have her.

01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:21.827
So lucky.

01:08:21.828 --> 01:08:23.296
Good night, Alyssa!

01:08:23.298 --> 01:08:28.265
Dave hasn't had this much
fun since Samantha left.

01:08:31.839 --> 01:08:33.041
Who's Samantha?

01:08:36.978 --> 01:08:38.676
My ex-wife.

01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:39.881
Say that again?

01:08:40.881 --> 01:08:42.984
Samantha is my ex-wife.

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:51.724
And by wife you mean
a gender neutral term

01:08:51.725 --> 01:08:53.562
for your male partner?

01:08:56.296 --> 01:08:58.000
You lying bastard.

01:08:59.666 --> 01:09:02.004
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on!

01:09:03.904 --> 01:09:06.004
I said she was a man because,

01:09:06.006 --> 01:09:08.073
I've never talked about
anything like that before.

01:09:08.076 --> 01:09:11.310
And I didn't think
that you would believe

01:09:11.312 --> 01:09:14.180
I've lived as a straight
guy all those years.

01:09:14.182 --> 01:09:15.017
I didn't.

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:18.184
That shit happens
all the time,

01:09:18.185 --> 01:09:21.118
why wouldn't we believe you?

01:09:21.121 --> 01:09:23.724
I don't know, I'm an idiot.

01:09:30.063 --> 01:09:34.064
My therapist says I
need to work on my past

01:09:34.067 --> 01:09:36.968
by giving people
a second chance.

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:38.937
That's good advice.

01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:39.974
Shut up.

01:09:41.009 --> 01:09:42.109
I will not,

01:09:43.777 --> 01:09:45.645
let you get me this mad.

01:09:45.647 --> 01:09:47.145
I'm sorry.

01:09:47.147 --> 01:09:48.582

Sorry, Taylor,
read the scripture.

01:10:26.687 --> 01:10:28.119
Do not be fooled.

01:10:28.121 --> 01:10:30.989

worship idols,

you will be the very

01:11:09.129 --> 01:11:10.930
Of course.

01:11:10.932 --> 01:11:13.899
All right, have a
good day, goodbye.

01:11:15.103 --> 01:11:16.435
Have a seat, Dave,
you're making me nervous.

01:11:16.437 --> 01:11:17.372
I'm done.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.907
You're done for the day or?

01:11:21.909 --> 01:11:23.175
Forever, I'm done.

01:11:24.778 --> 01:11:26.412
This is because of Nate?

01:11:26.414 --> 01:11:28.279
Why does this mean
so much to you?

01:11:28.281 --> 01:11:31.249
Because, Gordon, Nate matters.

01:11:31.251 --> 01:11:33.084
Things we do matter.

01:11:33.086 --> 01:11:36.090
The things that we
say, they matter.

01:11:44.098 --> 01:11:45.463
Think about this, Dave.

01:11:45.465 --> 01:11:47.999
- I have.
- Have you?

01:11:48.001 --> 01:11:48.833
Where you gonna work?

01:11:48.835 --> 01:11:50.302
Where are you gonna go?

01:11:50.304 --> 01:11:52.303
To your girlfriend
who thinks you're gay?

01:11:52.305 --> 01:11:54.205
Your crazy Aunt Patty?

01:11:54.207 --> 01:11:56.242
We have to stand
for the truth, man,

01:11:56.244 --> 01:11:57.976
because nobody else will.

01:11:57.978 --> 01:11:59.779
Love speaks the truth.

01:11:59.781 --> 01:12:01.146
That's the only
way we can fix him.

01:12:01.148 --> 01:12:02.248
He's not broken!

01:12:06.187 --> 01:12:07.552
Dave, have you thought about

01:12:07.554 --> 01:12:10.122
who your new friends really are?

01:12:10.124 --> 01:12:12.490
The scriptures are
very clear on this.

01:12:12.492 --> 01:12:13.926
They're right there next to

01:12:13.928 --> 01:12:16.162
the idolaters and
the adulterers.

01:12:16.164 --> 01:12:19.265
This is who you're
supporting now.

01:12:19.267 --> 01:12:20.102
Support?

01:12:21.568 --> 01:12:25.037
You want to talk to
me about support?

01:12:25.039 --> 01:12:26.204
Okay.

01:12:26.206 --> 01:12:29.108
How was I supported when the
church turned their back on me

01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:32.077
after Samantha left, huh?

01:12:32.079 --> 01:12:35.213
When I heard whispers and
those Christian parents

01:12:35.215 --> 01:12:37.550
who boycotted my practice
because, according to them,

01:12:37.552 --> 01:12:40.921
I allowed my own
wife to be perverted.

01:12:41.555 --> 01:12:43.189
That's not okay.

01:12:43.191 --> 01:12:47.193
So let's talk about
this list of sinners.

01:12:47.195 --> 01:12:50.165
The cheats, the
greedy, the idolaters.

01:12:51.398 --> 01:12:55.202
When I look at Erika,
Bruce, Kyle, and Nate.

01:12:56.504 --> 01:12:57.869
I don't see the people
who have anything

01:12:57.871 --> 01:13:00.172
to do with that list.

01:13:00.174 --> 01:13:01.176
I see,

01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:05.246
I see a love I never saw here.

01:13:08.049 --> 01:13:11.219
So you can keep your
psych department.

01:13:18.259 --> 01:13:19.294
Dave.

01:13:21.262 --> 01:13:23.494
It actually sounds really nice,

01:13:23.496 --> 01:13:25.898
this place you've found.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.632
I'm sure it feels good.

01:13:27.634 --> 01:13:31.403
And I'm sure you think it's
some new kind of enlightenment.

01:13:31.405 --> 01:13:36.007
But it's not real, Dave and
I can't go there with you.

01:13:36.009 --> 01:13:38.079
I can't ignore the truth.

01:13:40.513 --> 01:13:42.983
There's no love without it.

01:13:54.362 --> 01:13:56.261
Good evening.

01:13:56.263 --> 01:13:58.596
Thank you for
coming out tonight.

01:13:58.598 --> 01:14:01.367
I would like to introduce
my good friend, Alyssa.

01:14:09.477 --> 01:14:14.482
Thank you again for
spending your evening with us.

01:14:15.650 --> 01:14:17.516
For those of you
who don't know me.

01:14:17.518 --> 01:14:20.151
My name is Alyssa Cane.

01:14:20.153 --> 01:14:22.223
My brother was Ryan Cane.

01:14:24.392 --> 01:14:26.294
You all know the story.

01:14:28.161 --> 01:14:31.596
We are here tonight to
finish what he started,

01:14:31.598 --> 01:14:32.998
so that such hate would never

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.566
be a part of this town again.

01:14:35.568 --> 01:14:38.369
So we are launching
a Zebra House

01:14:38.371 --> 01:14:41.409
at the Wabash property
down the street.

01:14:43.344 --> 01:14:46.248
A shelter for Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual,

01:14:49.349 --> 01:14:51.516
and Transgender teens could go

01:14:51.518 --> 01:14:54.720
when they have no
other place to turn.

01:14:54.722 --> 01:14:59.027
We understand this is a
new concept for our area,

01:15:00.161 --> 01:15:03.194
and you might have
some questions

01:15:03.196 --> 01:15:05.230
and we're here to answer them.

01:15:05.232 --> 01:15:07.632
As well as ask for
your financial support

01:15:07.634 --> 01:15:10.970
because we can not
do this without you.

01:15:10.972 --> 01:15:12.171
Thank you.

01:15:12.173 --> 01:15:15.010
With that, the
microphone is open.

01:15:27.988 --> 01:15:29.256
Hi, I'm Nate.

01:15:31.358 --> 01:15:35.463
I've been to a place like
this before in Orlando,

01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:40.401
without that place, I
wouldn't be here today.

01:15:41.501 --> 01:15:43.103
It saved my life.

01:15:44.437 --> 01:15:48.042
Thank you.

01:15:54.714 --> 01:15:57.382
I'm not really good with
mics, I'll just stay here.

01:15:57.384 --> 01:15:58.552
That's okay.

01:16:00.454 --> 01:16:04.392
I don't get the whole
gay thing, I never have.

01:16:05.593 --> 01:16:08.526
But, that doesn't mean
it's not a real issue.

01:16:08.528 --> 01:16:12.263
These kids, they don't
deserve to live on the streets

01:16:12.265 --> 01:16:15.199
because of something
they can't control.

01:16:15.201 --> 01:16:18.069
I'm in your corner
for a hundred dollars.

01:16:18.071 --> 01:16:21.008
Yes.

01:16:22.375 --> 01:16:23.475
Thank you.

01:16:27.281 --> 01:16:30.352
I'm here as a woman
married to a man,

01:16:31.419 --> 01:16:33.485
the way it should be.

01:16:33.487 --> 01:16:37.092
You all seem nice, but
I can't support you.

01:16:39.293 --> 01:16:42.360
I wish it was
different, I really do,

01:16:42.362 --> 01:16:45.463
but I can't change
what the Bible says.

01:16:45.465 --> 01:16:48.236
I know you'll
think this is hate.

01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:50.638
But I don't hate you.

01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:53.475
I love you.

01:16:55.675 --> 01:16:58.142
I just can't stand by

01:16:58.144 --> 01:17:00.678
and let you ruin the
sanctity of marriage.

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.315
Oh for the love of God.

01:17:03.317 --> 01:17:07.252
Mrs. Waters, thank you
for your comment really,

01:17:07.254 --> 01:17:09.087
and even though tonight
we're not talking

01:17:09.089 --> 01:17:11.092
about marriage equality,

01:17:12.226 --> 01:17:15.461
I want to personally
apologize to you

01:17:15.463 --> 01:17:17.829
that it's destroying the
sanctity of your third marriage.

01:17:20.134 --> 01:17:21.603
Oh, no she didn't.

01:17:26.874 --> 01:17:30.309
I've been learning in
class about black and white,

01:17:30.311 --> 01:17:34.148
and this is certainly a
black and white issue.

01:17:38.853 --> 01:17:43.187
It's a perversion, an
unnatural lifestyle

01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:45.457
that leads to destruction.

01:17:45.459 --> 01:17:47.226
My Bible is very clear

01:17:47.228 --> 01:17:51.762
when it says we need to separate
ourselves from such evil.

01:17:52.599 --> 01:17:54.501
Look, I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:17:56.237 --> 01:17:57.639
But it's the truth.

01:18:00.473 --> 01:18:02.507
Your brother was an abomination.

01:18:04.311 --> 01:18:05.144
It's the truth.

01:18:08.515 --> 01:18:10.552
1 Corinthians 6:9, 10.

01:18:11.785 --> 01:18:13.618
It's in the Bible.

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:14.752
That, that's enough.

01:18:14.754 --> 01:18:16.123
That's enough!

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.160
That's not love.

01:18:22.162 --> 01:18:23.430
That's not God.

01:18:25.198 --> 01:18:26.267
Mr. Hopper?

01:18:28.434 --> 01:18:29.838
What are you doing?

01:18:34.607 --> 01:18:36.276
You know this kid?

01:18:37.478 --> 01:18:41.349
Yeah, he's my professor
at Lakeside Christian.

01:18:42.383 --> 01:18:43.684
He taught me that.

01:18:47.655 --> 01:18:49.657
You, you taught me that.

01:18:52.593 --> 01:18:55.662
Everything I just
said came from you.

01:18:57.464 --> 01:18:58.867
I don't understand.

01:19:00.467 --> 01:19:04.272
Have you been playing both
sides the entire time?

01:19:26.693 --> 01:19:27.993
I'm gonna get a
little more mean about this.

01:19:27.995 --> 01:19:30.494
I'm just saying you guys
are being way too nice.

01:19:30.496 --> 01:19:32.364
All I'm saying is
that from now on

01:19:32.366 --> 01:19:33.565
maybe we should be a
little bit more careful

01:19:33.567 --> 01:19:34.833
about who we let in.

01:19:34.835 --> 01:19:36.767
Preacher, you need
to pray for him.

01:19:36.769 --> 01:19:38.703
I will, Richard, I will.

01:19:38.705 --> 01:19:39.870
How are you not angry?

01:19:39.872 --> 01:19:40.806
Calm down.

01:19:40.808 --> 01:19:41.739
I'm not gonna calm...

01:19:41.741 --> 01:19:42.541
If you tell me to calm down.

01:19:42.543 --> 01:19:44.478
You son of a bitch!

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:51.553
Are you even gay?

01:19:52.553 --> 01:19:53.555
Oh my god.

01:19:54.621 --> 01:19:55.886
I knew it, I knew it.

01:19:55.888 --> 01:19:57.855
What about the car wash?

01:19:57.857 --> 01:19:58.923
That was you!

01:19:58.925 --> 01:19:59.824
And he blamed him.

01:19:59.826 --> 01:20:01.525
- Come on.
- That was Dave?

01:20:01.527 --> 01:20:02.427
Piece of shit.

01:20:02.429 --> 01:20:03.261
You see.

01:20:03.263 --> 01:20:05.365
I told you guys.

01:20:06.433 --> 01:20:07.565
I don't know what to say.

01:20:07.567 --> 01:20:09.900
You'd better
figure something out!

01:20:09.902 --> 01:20:11.302
You know Mulberry had

01:20:11.304 --> 01:20:14.308
a same-sex homecoming
couple last year?

01:20:16.677 --> 01:20:18.944
I was raised in Mulberry.

01:20:18.946 --> 01:20:23.614
A gay kid growing up in the
south in the 50s and 60s.

01:20:23.616 --> 01:20:24.918
That was not easy.

01:20:26.687 --> 01:20:29.756
I had my share of
slurs and beatings,

01:20:32.358 --> 01:20:34.559
but I was one of the lucky ones.

01:20:34.561 --> 01:20:36.863
My parents always accepted me.

01:20:37.798 --> 01:20:40.298
And it made things better.

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:42.700
Oh things are much better now.

01:20:42.702 --> 01:20:44.535
We got over Stonewall.

01:20:44.537 --> 01:20:45.770
We got over the AIDS crisis

01:20:45.772 --> 01:20:48.640
and the lies they told about us.

01:20:48.642 --> 01:20:50.708
We can even marry now,
which is something

01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:54.812
I thought I would never
see in a lifetime.

01:20:54.814 --> 01:20:58.684
But I have been living
in a dream world.

01:20:58.686 --> 01:21:01.656
One where, well,
everyone is changing

01:21:03.656 --> 01:21:08.662
and getting over their fear and
accepting us as just people.

01:21:10.731 --> 01:21:13.965
But tonight,

01:21:13.967 --> 01:21:18.505
Tonight pulled up emotions
I had buried for decades.

01:21:20.808 --> 01:21:22.974
Words that killed me as a kid.

01:21:22.976 --> 01:21:26.647
Words that will kill
every kid in that room.

01:21:28.048 --> 01:21:31.882
And I'm tired of
living the dream world.

01:21:31.884 --> 01:21:35.322
I'm gonna speak up
and I'm gonna fight.

01:21:36.823 --> 01:21:40.061
And thank you, David,
for reminding me.

01:21:46.767 --> 01:21:48.667
I believe that the
way we treat people

01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:51.669
who we disagree with the most

01:21:51.671 --> 01:21:53.941
is our true test of our faith.

01:21:55.808 --> 01:21:58.709
So, I won't hold
this against you.

01:21:58.711 --> 01:21:59.944
I will.

01:21:59.946 --> 01:22:01.413
Absolutely.

01:22:01.415 --> 01:22:02.012
You can
forget that idea.

01:22:02.014 --> 01:22:02.681
Me too, really.

01:22:02.683 --> 01:22:03.648
Get a life.

01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:04.485
Please.

01:22:05.652 --> 01:22:08.523
Call from
Hot Sweet Muffin.

01:22:09.822 --> 01:22:11.455
You sure he ain't gay?

01:22:11.457 --> 01:22:13.792
Call from Hot.

01:22:13.794 --> 01:22:14.629
Hello?

01:22:15.862 --> 01:22:17.462
Frank.

01:22:18.464 --> 01:22:19.864
Okay.

01:22:19.866 --> 01:22:21.432
I'm coming.

01:22:43.022 --> 01:22:45.791
I never thought you
cared about that thing.

01:22:45.793 --> 01:22:47.892
I don't care about that thing.

01:22:47.894 --> 01:22:50.063
I care about what it says.

01:22:51.564 --> 01:22:53.798
I'm not sure I follow.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:57.104
People like you
care about that thing.

01:22:58.839 --> 01:23:00.908
Care about the answers.

01:23:02.142 --> 01:23:06.043
You spend your whole life
reading it, studying it,

01:23:06.045 --> 01:23:08.579
down to every last syllable.

01:23:08.581 --> 01:23:09.983
You obsess with it,

01:23:11.585 --> 01:23:13.821
but you miss what it's about.

01:23:15.488 --> 01:23:19.024
There's a lot in here
I don't understand,

01:23:19.026 --> 01:23:21.729
but I do know what it's about.

01:23:23.796 --> 01:23:27.634
Mystery is God's way of
keeping humans humble.

01:23:30.571 --> 01:23:33.908
Sounds like a
complicated way to live.

01:23:34.875 --> 01:23:36.908
Maybe you've done
that to yourself.

01:23:51.558 --> 01:23:53.891
How much do you know?

01:23:53.893 --> 01:23:54.728
Enough.

01:23:57.231 --> 01:23:59.096
Why didn't you stop me?

01:23:59.098 --> 01:24:00.967
That's not my job.

01:24:01.835 --> 01:24:03.971
You're a grown-ass man.

01:24:04.937 --> 01:24:07.538
My job was to love you.

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.541
And give you a place to stay

01:24:09.543 --> 01:24:12.243
when you had no place to stay,

01:24:12.245 --> 01:24:14.846
when nobody wanted you.

01:24:18.885 --> 01:24:20.655
I really messed up.

01:24:21.888 --> 01:24:24.689
Really hurt some people.

01:24:24.691 --> 01:24:26.760
Well, go make it right.

01:24:28.094 --> 01:24:30.694
I don't even
know where to start.

01:24:30.696 --> 01:24:31.698
Come here.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.242
There's this thing the Jews do.

01:24:44.244 --> 01:24:45.644
I'm not Jewish.

01:24:45.646 --> 01:24:47.745
But
your boy, Jesus was.

01:24:50.116 --> 01:24:54.752
They don't start their day
in the morning the way we do.

01:24:54.754 --> 01:24:57.592
They start at
sundown, before bed,

01:24:59.092 --> 01:25:01.496
and reflect upon their day.

01:25:03.095 --> 01:25:06.867
At the end of the day,
for the past 60 years,

01:25:08.335 --> 01:25:09.937
I've asked myself

01:25:11.138 --> 01:25:12.907
who did I love today?

01:25:16.876 --> 01:25:20.046
You say you don't
know where to start.

01:25:22.316 --> 01:25:23.851
Start with love.

01:25:27.888 --> 01:25:30.124
Who did you love today, Dave?

01:25:38.698 --> 01:25:41.199
Have you seen
any of these yet?

01:25:41.201 --> 01:25:42.837
Read 'em to me.

01:25:47.941 --> 01:25:51.245
I need to hear your
laugh one more time.

01:25:53.679 --> 01:25:56.851
Thank you for showing
me what love is.

01:26:00.086 --> 01:26:03.922
Hot Sweet Muffin got
me huffin' and puffin'.

01:26:03.924 --> 01:26:04.959
Frank.

01:26:08.061 --> 01:26:11.831
Thank you for listening
when no one else did.

01:26:14.034 --> 01:26:17.604
Patty, you made me
believe in people again.

01:26:20.272 --> 01:26:24.344
You were the first person
I felt actually saw me.

01:26:26.379 --> 01:26:29.583
You made it okay
for me to be weird.

01:26:34.153 --> 01:26:36.756
You're pretty popular, Patty.

01:26:39.125 --> 01:26:39.960
Patty?

01:26:49.169 --> 01:26:50.101
I think
we all remember

01:26:50.103 --> 01:26:53.137
the first time we met Patty.

01:26:53.139 --> 01:26:54.204
And if you were like me,

01:26:54.206 --> 01:26:56.041
the first time you
met her you were,

01:26:56.043 --> 01:27:00.310
well you didn't know exactly
what to think of her.

01:27:00.312 --> 01:27:02.747
If there's one thing
Patty taught me,

01:27:02.749 --> 01:27:04.114
it was what living and loving

01:27:04.116 --> 01:27:07.819
without labels
actually looks like.

01:27:07.821 --> 01:27:10.387
And that reminds me
of 1 Corinthians 13

01:27:10.389 --> 01:27:14.191
that's sometimes referred
to as the love chapter,

01:27:14.193 --> 01:27:17.428
if I speak in the tongues
of mortals and angels

01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:22.167
but do not have love, I'm a
noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.

01:27:55.869 --> 01:28:00.875
Oh yeah, I've been embracing
the colors more lately.

01:28:02.041 --> 01:28:03.141
The place goes to
auction next week.

01:28:03.143 --> 01:28:04.441
We'll all be there.

01:28:04.443 --> 01:28:06.211
You guys don't have a prayer.

01:28:06.213 --> 01:28:09.180
Yeah, it's kind of
more of a statement.

01:28:09.182 --> 01:28:11.285
Why are you here, Nate?

01:28:12.919 --> 01:28:17.122
I was kind of hoping that
you weren't going to be here.

01:28:17.124 --> 01:28:19.760
Sorry to disappoint.

01:28:22.829 --> 01:28:25.232
I need to tell you a story.

01:28:26.232 --> 01:28:29.033
Before I came out to my mom,

01:28:29.035 --> 01:28:31.235
I had it all
perfectly planned out.

01:28:31.237 --> 01:28:33.238
I rehearsed different
responses depending on

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.039
if she'd hit me or hug me.

01:28:36.041 --> 01:28:38.275
I mean I really didn't
have a reason to be scared,

01:28:38.277 --> 01:28:41.980
she was always supportive
of other gay kids at school,

01:28:41.982 --> 01:28:44.114
but my friends said that
she would be different

01:28:44.116 --> 01:28:46.387
with her own kid, you know.

01:28:52.092 --> 01:28:56.895
One day I just, I went
off script and I said it.

01:28:56.897 --> 01:28:59.129
I told her I was gay.

01:28:59.131 --> 01:29:01.102
So she kicked you out?

01:29:04.004 --> 01:29:05.139
She hugged me.

01:29:06.305 --> 01:29:08.476
Told me that she loved me.

01:29:09.442 --> 01:29:10.811
We both cried.

01:29:11.978 --> 01:29:14.782
That's my favorite
memory with her.

01:29:15.549 --> 01:29:18.082
So what happened?

01:29:18.084 --> 01:29:20.351
She got this job in Orlando

01:29:20.353 --> 01:29:23.120
and things started
getting rough at home.

01:29:23.122 --> 01:29:26.190
So she started going to this
counselor on her lunch break

01:29:26.192 --> 01:29:30.227
to work on her issues,
I guess, she said.

01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:31.365
But she changed.

01:29:33.933 --> 01:29:35.600
Seemed distant.

01:29:35.602 --> 01:29:38.602
Questioning if I was
really gay or not.

01:29:38.604 --> 01:29:42.306
Started to sound a lot
like you do in class.

01:29:42.308 --> 01:29:44.244
One day, she came home.

01:29:53.186 --> 01:29:55.289
I need you to watch this.

01:30:06.866 --> 01:30:10.400
Honey, come
on, let's get this started.

01:30:10.402 --> 01:30:15.205
Nate, honey,
I want to tell you something

01:30:15.207 --> 01:30:17.277
before I say anything else.

01:30:19.211 --> 01:30:20.147
I love you.

01:30:21.281 --> 01:30:23.381
Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:30:23.383 --> 01:30:25.350
- I
- know you've been gay

01:30:25.352 --> 01:30:28.386
since you been a little boy.

01:30:28.388 --> 01:30:31.256
Yeah, so you
know by this point

01:30:31.258 --> 01:30:33.925
that it's not a choice.

01:30:33.927 --> 01:30:36.093
It is a choice.

01:30:36.095 --> 01:30:38.499
No, it's not a choice.

01:30:40.267 --> 01:30:44.235
In that
case, you have a choice now.

01:30:44.237 --> 01:30:46.303
You could either get
help or move out.

01:30:46.305 --> 01:30:48.472
I can't support your lifestyle.

01:30:48.474 --> 01:30:51.275
Mom, it's not a...

01:30:51.277 --> 01:30:53.144
It's who I am.

01:30:53.146 --> 01:30:55.279
My baby
was not born a queer.

01:30:55.281 --> 01:30:58.315
I don't know
where this is coming from?

01:30:58.317 --> 01:31:01.418
From
the Bible, from God.

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:04.154
No, you
didn't say this before.

01:31:04.156 --> 01:31:06.958
You weren't like
this, you loved me.

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.028
You loved me.

01:31:09.129 --> 01:31:10.627
I still love you.

01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:12.230
No, no, that's not what...

01:31:14.467 --> 01:31:16.367
Get back
you son-of-a-bitch!

01:31:16.369 --> 01:31:17.401
What is wrong with you?

01:31:17.403 --> 01:31:20.003
Stop!

01:31:20.005 --> 01:31:22.543
There's something
wrong with you.

01:31:24.076 --> 01:31:25.944
There's
nothing wrong with me.

01:31:25.946 --> 01:31:28.512
You're a disgrace.

01:31:28.514 --> 01:31:31.050
I'm not a disgrace.

01:31:32.352 --> 01:31:36.186
I can't
believe that I have said

01:31:36.188 --> 01:31:38.358
that my son is a disgrace.

01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:12.425
Nate.

01:32:15.027 --> 01:32:16.195
It's not true.

01:32:19.232 --> 01:32:23.003
I came here to tell
you that I forgive you.

01:32:26.638 --> 01:32:28.172
You're not a disgrace.

01:32:29.576 --> 01:32:31.111
I forgive you.

01:32:38.384 --> 01:32:41.155
You're not a disgrace.

01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:06.610
We're here for the auction.

01:33:06.612 --> 01:33:07.779
You're early.

01:33:07.781 --> 01:33:09.446
We wanted to be early.

01:33:09.448 --> 01:33:11.681

01:33:11.683 --> 01:33:14.420

And who
the hell are you?

01:35:02.195 --> 01:35:05.462
Gordon Woodman, the Dean

You're the son-of-a-bitch
who used Dave.

01:35:07.567 --> 01:35:09.566
Send that kid to
the meeting too?

01:35:09.568 --> 01:35:14.437

01:36:25.978 --> 01:36:28.412
But that's not how it works.

01:36:28.414 --> 01:36:29.480
Sorry.

01:36:29.482 --> 01:36:31.649
That's not how this works.

01:36:31.651 --> 01:36:35.653
Okay, so we're
probably not gonna get

01:36:35.655 --> 01:36:37.754
what we came here for today,

01:36:37.756 --> 01:36:42.763
and we've all been through
way more than we should have,

01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:46.029
but I know we're
stronger because of it.

01:36:46.031 --> 01:36:47.500

01:36:48.367 --> 01:36:50.568

Let's just start the
bidding at 19,000, shall we?

01:36:53.039 --> 01:36:56.306
We'll start the
bidding at 10,000.

01:36:56.308 --> 01:36:59.677
- $10,000, do I hear 10,000?
- Here.

Here.

01:37:03.049 --> 01:37:05.619

$18,427.

01:37:10.656 --> 01:37:13.893
$18,427,
do I hear 20, 25?

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:16.229
$50 thousand.

01:37:19.631 --> 01:37:20.965
52,000.

01:37:20.967 --> 01:37:23.734
52,000, going once.

01:37:23.736 --> 01:37:24.738
$60,000!

01:37:26.772 --> 01:37:28.439
62,000.

01:37:28.441 --> 01:37:30.841
- 62,000, going once.
- For God's sake.

01:37:30.843 --> 01:37:32.012
$100 thousand.

01:37:39.719 --> 01:37:42.956
$100
thousand, going once.

01:37:44.089 --> 01:37:47.024
$100 thousand, going twice.

01:37:51.363 --> 01:37:52.430
Hold on!

01:37:52.432 --> 01:37:53.064
What's he doing?

01:37:53.066 --> 01:37:54.501
I don't know.

01:37:55.567 --> 01:37:56.570
Excuse me.

01:38:02.508 --> 01:38:03.873
Okay.

01:38:03.875 --> 01:38:04.710
Ah.

01:38:06.012 --> 01:38:08.611
All right, can you?

01:38:08.613 --> 01:38:10.047
Okay, thank you.

01:38:10.049 --> 01:38:13.818
All right, I know
none of you want

01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:16.820
to hear anything
I have to say now,

01:38:16.822 --> 01:38:19.890
but just give me one moment.

01:38:19.892 --> 01:38:20.727
Please.

01:38:22.728 --> 01:38:23.763
All right.

01:38:26.665 --> 01:38:29.400
I know that I have caused each

01:38:29.402 --> 01:38:32.669
and every one of you
some sort of pain.

01:38:32.671 --> 01:38:35.375
And I am deeply, deeply sorry.

01:38:40.545 --> 01:38:41.912
I've always measured my success

01:38:41.914 --> 01:38:44.785
based on having all the answers.

01:38:46.753 --> 01:38:50.323
And that arrogance has
caused a lot of pain.

01:38:52.825 --> 01:38:54.961
Today, the only thing I know

01:38:56.995 --> 01:38:59.864
is that I don't
really know a lot

01:38:59.866 --> 01:39:01.568
about anything, life,

01:39:03.102 --> 01:39:04.537
love, struggle.

01:39:06.805 --> 01:39:08.875
I saw all of you as broken.

01:39:11.411 --> 01:39:13.046
You were never broken.

01:39:15.781 --> 01:39:16.615
I was.

01:39:18.683 --> 01:39:21.151
I believe we were at sold.

01:39:21.153 --> 01:39:22.856
Oh, uh, 200,000.

01:39:25.424 --> 01:39:26.690
$200 thousand.

01:39:26.692 --> 01:39:27.958
You can't be serious.

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:30.593
You can't even pay
your car payments.

01:39:30.595 --> 01:39:32.797
Call it a
gift from Aunt Patty.

01:39:32.799 --> 01:39:34.735
David, don't do this.

01:39:35.668 --> 01:39:37.970
The bid is at $200 thousand.

01:39:40.839 --> 01:39:43.908
$200
thousand, going once.

01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:45.045
$400 thousand.

01:39:50.982 --> 01:39:53.619
$400 thousand.

01:39:54.653 --> 01:39:56.822
$400 thousand, going once.

01:39:58.991 --> 01:40:01.461
$400 thousand, going twice.

01:40:05.764 --> 01:40:07.433
$400 thousand, sold.

01:40:30.055 --> 01:40:31.424
Hey, Alyssa.

01:40:33.259 --> 01:40:35.562
Hey, could I have a ride?

01:40:37.930 --> 01:40:39.797
That was really nice
what you did back there,

01:40:39.799 --> 01:40:41.832
but we're not okay.

01:40:41.834 --> 01:40:43.167
Yeah, I know.

01:40:43.169 --> 01:40:46.270
But Patty left you something.

01:40:46.272 --> 01:40:47.941
It's at her house.

01:40:52.644 --> 01:40:53.446
Get in.

01:41:08.928 --> 01:41:10.831
Come on, it's inside.

01:41:22.575 --> 01:41:23.809
One more thing.

01:41:24.876 --> 01:41:26.912
You gotta put this on.

01:41:33.184 --> 01:41:34.885
This is getting weird.

01:41:34.887 --> 01:41:36.490
It's not weird.

01:41:40.058 --> 01:41:40.990
Almost there.

01:41:40.992 --> 01:41:42.528
Okay.

01:41:44.996 --> 01:41:46.096
Okay.

01:41:46.098 --> 01:41:46.997
Stay right here.

01:41:46.999 --> 01:41:48.001
Okay.

01:41:54.339 --> 01:41:56.739
You can
take it off now.

01:41:56.741 --> 01:41:57.775
I don't know. I'm
kinda getting used to it.

01:41:57.777 --> 01:41:58.609
Just take it off.

01:41:58.611 --> 01:41:59.211
Okay.

01:42:04.683 --> 01:42:06.016
Frank.

01:42:06.018 --> 01:42:08.555
She wanted to give me Frank.

01:42:20.066 --> 01:42:21.798
The Ryan Home?

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.968
Yeah.

01:42:25.737 --> 01:42:28.271
The Ryan Home?

01:42:28.273 --> 01:42:31.609
Ryan's dream, here.

01:42:31.611 --> 01:42:32.245
Now.

01:42:33.912 --> 01:42:35.980
Is this real?

01:42:35.982 --> 01:42:36.913
Patty
left me the house,

01:42:36.915 --> 01:42:39.216
she said fill it with love,

01:42:39.218 --> 01:42:41.985
you're the most
loving people I know.

01:42:47.927 --> 01:42:50.026
The Ryan Home.

01:42:50.028 --> 01:42:50.930
Hell yes.

01:42:53.232 --> 01:42:54.668
It's perfect.

01:42:58.036 --> 01:43:00.104
I won't disappoint her.

01:43:00.106 --> 01:43:01.107
I promise.

01:43:20.026 --> 01:43:20.992
Hey look what I made

01:43:20.994 --> 01:43:23.226

in the entire universe.

01:43:23.228 --> 01:43:24.360
Hand-crafted.

All natural, chocolate
chip cookies.

The most important part

01:43:32.405 --> 01:43:35.038
about being a 60 minute man

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.807
is step three, the rubbing.

01:43:37.809 --> 01:43:39.409
A lot of guys don't
understand that,

01:43:39.411 --> 01:43:42.014
