39:38.529 --> 39:40.718
Fair enough.

39:40.818 --> 39:42.342
But I will say this.

39:42.442 --> 39:44.257
The spell broke
because I hurt you,

39:44.357 --> 39:47.211
and I hurt you
because I hurt Jessica.

39:47.311 --> 39:51.724
It's pretty obvious that you
love her and she loves you.

39:53.263 --> 39:57.325
You guys were meant to be
together. I get that now. I do.

39:57.425 --> 40:01.836
And I know that we're
just meant to be friends.

[GLASS SHATTERS]

40:42.626 --> 40:45.064
Oh, that's all right,
we'll clean it up later.

40:45.164 --> 40:47.229
Are you feeling okay?

40:47.329 --> 40:48.768
- Very funny.
- You're kidding me.

40:48.868 --> 40:51.100
That's not killing you,
just leaving a mess there?

40:51.200 --> 40:53.679
No, not at all.

40:53.779 --> 40:56.052
Okay, maybe a little,
but not a lot.

40:56.152 --> 40:58.342
Look, if there's anything
I've learned from all this,

40:58.442 --> 41:01.214
is that I gotta learn
to deal with messes,
especially with a baby coming.

41:01.314 --> 41:02.879
Because I hear they come
with a lot of messes.

41:02.979 --> 41:04.710
- I heard some things
about that too.
- PIPER: Yeah.

41:04.810 --> 41:07.082
Well, it's good that something
positive came from
the witch doctor.

41:07.182 --> 41:08.473
PHOEBE:
Yoo-hoo.

41:09.762 --> 41:12.535
- Hi.
- Hey, Pheebs, what's cooking?

41:12.635 --> 41:15.032
Oh, if you're talking about
Spencer Ricks, not him.

41:15.132 --> 41:17.446
I turned him back into the pig
that he was,

41:17.546 --> 41:19.651
and unfortunately,
he won't remember any of it.

41:19.751 --> 41:21.691
I'm glad to see
you're not competitive anymore.

41:21.791 --> 41:24.480
Yeah, no. I don't think
I have to worry anymore

41:24.580 --> 41:25.744
about him taking my readers.

41:26.744 --> 41:28.741
- And why would that be?
- PHOEBE: Well...

41:30.574 --> 41:33.928
- ...because...
- PIPER: Whoa.

41:34.028 --> 41:36.716
- Oh, no.
- PHOEBE: Oh, yes.

41:36.816 --> 41:39.672
"Why ask Phoebe
when you can see her?"

41:39.772 --> 41:41.462
Talk about journalistic
ethics, right?

41:41.562 --> 41:44.292
- Oh!

41:44.392 --> 41:46.831
No retouching. Good times.

41:46.931 --> 41:48.163
Okay, give-- Give me that.

41:48.263 --> 41:49.618
- No.
- No.

41:49.718 --> 41:51.551
- PIPER: Run, run.
- Leo.

41:52.715 --> 41:54.048
PHOEBE:
Leo!
