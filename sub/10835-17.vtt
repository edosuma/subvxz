WEBVTT

00:01.794 --> 00:03.086
Previously on 90210...

00:03.211 --> 00:04.672
I wanted to get
something permanent

00:04.797 --> 00:06.632
to symbolize our love.

00:06.757 --> 00:07.967
We just had sex
in the media room.

00:08.090 --> 00:10.344
You and me in the
storage room right now.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.345
Being your friend?

00:11.470 --> 00:12.638
I'm over it.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.431
(laughing)
I already beat you to it.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.642
Us getting together didn't
work out for either of us, okay?

00:16.767 --> 00:18.226
But don't punish my sister.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.812
West Beverly High
doesn't revolve

00:19.937 --> 00:21.355
around Kelly Taylor's
love life.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.482
If anybody should be
pissed here, it's me.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.150
Brenda? Really?

00:25.275 --> 00:26.234
I wanted to ask you something.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.277
Will you be my valentine?

00:27.402 --> 00:28.570
Yeah.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.280
I don't want to keep fighting.
Me, neither.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.533
Let's end this.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.702
I want to show a film
as my presentation.

00:34.827 --> 00:35.828
I'm in it?
Just you wait.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.538
DIXON:
You filmed us having sex?

00:37.663 --> 00:38.497
What's wrong with you?

00:38.622 --> 00:40.081
I love you so much, Dixon.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.124
Just stay away from me.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.960
RYAN:
Silver did this?

00:43.084 --> 00:45.796
Silver, what
are you doing?
I want you

00:45.921 --> 00:47.756
to fix all of this.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.341
Silver, listen.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.301
(screeching
and glass shattering)

00:51.426 --> 00:53.595
Okay. Silver, please.
Don't you move.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.556
I'm not.
We both know

00:55.681 --> 00:56.598
you tried
to turn Dixon against me.

00:56.724 --> 00:57.766
Okay.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.476
How can I fix things?

00:59.601 --> 01:02.479
You can start
by telling him the truth.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.480
You can tell him

01:04.605 --> 01:06.358
how you were manipulating him

01:06.483 --> 01:08.819
and feeding him lies about me.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.572
Okay. No problem.

01:11.697 --> 01:12.907
Do you want me to call him?

01:17.661 --> 01:19.538
Stop!
Silver... Silver!

01:19.663 --> 01:20.622
Calm down. It's okay.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.165
It's okay.
Silver!

01:22.290 --> 01:23.375
Let go of me!
Okay.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.668
It's okay.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.378
Get off! Get off.
Get off.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.427
(sobbing)

01:36.764 --> 01:38.891
Silver, listen to me.

01:39.016 --> 01:43.437
It was because
of the movie.

01:43.562 --> 01:46.857
He really hated the
movie, didn't he?

01:46.982 --> 01:49.818
I thought he would love the
movie, but he hated it.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.114
I don't know Dixon at all.

01:56.825 --> 02:00.621
He was the one person
that I loved the most

02:00.746 --> 02:02.623
and I don't know who he is.

02:02.748 --> 02:03.791
I don't understand.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.209
Come on.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.795
You don't have
to figure it all out now.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.545
Yes, I do.

02:09.670 --> 02:10.714
No.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.591
You don't.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.635
You need to get some rest.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.428
Listen, let's call Kelly.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.722
Okay?

02:18.847 --> 02:20.808
Why are my hands bleeding?

02:22.309 --> 02:23.727
I might get blood on your couch.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.980
Okay, doesn't matter.

02:27.898 --> 02:28.649
Let me get you a bandage.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.275
Okay?

02:30.400 --> 02:31.359
Then we'll call Kelly.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.694
Okay.

02:32.820 --> 02:36.156
Then we'll call Kelly.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.329
Bandages...

02:42.454 --> 02:43.413
Uh, bandages.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.748
Yeah, I know that I have them

02:44.873 --> 02:46.708
in here. Okay, got it.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.585
Let's see that hand.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.550
Silver?

03:21.409 --> 03:23.495
I thought we were meant
to be together.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.288
But if you

03:25.413 --> 03:28.042
want to be alone...

03:29.710 --> 03:31.378
Then just go.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.505
(cell phone ringing)

03:35.841 --> 03:36.967
(phone beeps on)

03:37.092 --> 03:39.720
Mom, can I call you back?

03:39.845 --> 03:41.972
Is everything okay?

03:42.097 --> 03:43.974
No, I'm not with her.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.767
Why? What happened?

03:45.893 --> 03:49.646
Is Dixon all right?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.732
Yeah, no, I'm coming home now.

03:51.857 --> 03:52.733
Is everything okay?

03:52.858 --> 03:54.359
No!

03:54.484 --> 03:56.528
I don't know.
It's Silver.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.488
I have to get home.

03:58.613 --> 03:59.990
(sighing)

04:00.115 --> 04:01.658
And I didn't drive.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.035
I'll take you.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.763
HARRY:
You need to tell us exactly
what's been going on.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.598
Don't leave anything out.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.850
What? What do you mean, Silver
broke into your apartment?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.435
I mean, I come home and the
window is smashed, okay?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.437
And Silver is there.
No way.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.564
She got a giant
tattoo of your name?

04:32.689 --> 04:33.523
And you didn't think this
was worth mentioning?

04:33.648 --> 04:35.275
I'm sorry.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.944
Believe me, Kelly, all right?
Something is going on with her.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.028
No, I would know.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.696
Do you know
about her movie?

04:39.821 --> 04:41.823
What movie?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.493
She kind of

04:45.619 --> 04:47.037
filmed us...

04:47.162 --> 04:48.789
having sex.

04:48.914 --> 04:49.706
KELLY:
I think I'm going to throw up.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.750
I had no idea.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.668
You had sex?
You made a movie of it?

04:53.794 --> 04:54.878
ADRIANNA:
Freaky.

04:55.003 --> 04:55.963
Totally, totally freaky.

04:56.088 --> 04:58.381
What?
Silver apparently made...

04:58.506 --> 04:59.674
Har-gow,
flower scallion rolls...

04:59.800 --> 05:01.009
Ooh!
...and lor-mai-gai.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.886
Don't eat the leaf.
What?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.471
Don't eat the leaf.
Got it. Thanks.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.182
Uh, so Silver apparently what?

05:07.307 --> 05:10.518
Um, hold up. Can we get some
sesame balls, too, please?

05:10.644 --> 05:13.521
(phone ringing)
Thanks. Oh, it's
Naomi. Hold on.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.023
Hey.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.441
We have to talk.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.944
Crazy night.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.237
I know, I heard.
NAOMI: Heard what?

05:20.361 --> 05:22.739
That Liam's a psychopath
and an awesome kisser?

05:22.864 --> 05:25.659
I was talking about
Silver's movie, but wow.
Wow what?

05:25.784 --> 05:27.619
Liam is a total psychopath
and an awesome kisser.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.330
What happened with Silver?

05:30.455 --> 05:31.498
Apparently, she made
a porno of herself

05:31.623 --> 05:33.458
and showed it at some theater.
NAOMI: What?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.627
Naomi?

05:35.752 --> 05:36.920
Um, no, Silver.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.379
Why would she do that?

05:38.505 --> 05:39.756
I don't know.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.176
Unless...

05:42.301 --> 05:43.844
It's drugs. It's
got to be drugs.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.595
No, no way.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.888
I'm guessing cocaine.
Maybe meth.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.516
PCP?
Or LSD.

05:49.641 --> 05:50.642
Could be speed.
Weed?

05:50.767 --> 05:51.768
Methadone, mescaline,

05:51.893 --> 05:53.520
amphetamine, ketamine...

05:53.645 --> 05:54.938
Ecstasy.
Stimulants,

05:55.063 --> 05:56.106
sedatives...

05:56.231 --> 05:58.192
No! Stop! All right?

05:58.317 --> 06:00.527
She's not doing drugs.
I would know.

06:00.652 --> 06:01.945
Why else would she
break into my apartment?

06:02.070 --> 06:02.904
Or set a fire?

06:03.030 --> 06:04.781
Or get a tattoo?

06:04.906 --> 06:06.283
Why else would you film yourself
having sex?

06:06.407 --> 06:08.076
Oh, well, to improve your moves,
of course.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.577
Oh, ew.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.621
What? Athletes watch replays.

06:11.746 --> 06:12.789
It's the same thing.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.708
I don't know.
Sesame balls?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.251
Yeah.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.794
Ew. Is that your pet name
for Navid?

06:17.919 --> 06:18.920
I should call Dixon.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.464
(cell phone ringing)

06:21.589 --> 06:23.758
It's Kelly.
I'll take it.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.094
Hello?

06:26.220 --> 06:27.929
Nope, Dixon's not answering.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.848
What did Sesame Balls say?

06:29.973 --> 06:31.516
No, we don't know
where she is.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.726
I'm worried.

06:32.851 --> 06:33.935
I'm scared.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.645
We have to find her.

06:35.770 --> 06:36.771
before she hurts someone

06:36.897 --> 06:38.523
or herself.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.692
Oh, God, what is happening?

06:58.877 --> 06:59.753
We need to divide up.
Debbie and I

06:59.878 --> 07:01.338
will check out
the Peach Pit.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.048
Dixon, I'm going to drop you
off at home

07:03.173 --> 07:05.175
so you'll have access
to another car.
Got it.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.718
HARRY:
Somebody should check
out the school.

07:06.843 --> 07:07.969
Annie, here are the keys.
Ethan, you go with her.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.764
Uh, sounds good.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.182
HARRY:
Kelly, you want to stay here
in case she comes back?

07:12.307 --> 07:14.101
No, I have to do something.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.685
HARRY:
Okay, well, at least

07:15.810 --> 07:17.645
let somebody drive you.
Ryan, you mind?

07:17.771 --> 07:18.688
No prob.
No, that's okay.

07:20.065 --> 07:20.815
Let me be your chauffer.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.778
Sammy. What
about Sammy?

07:24.903 --> 07:27.989
NAVID:
Adrianna and I can watch him.
It's no problem.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.117
Okay, good. He's
upstairs, sleeping.
Okay.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.702
We should go.
All right. Everybody
stay in touch by cell phone.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.996
Really?

07:35.122 --> 07:37.165
Babysitting?
Why not?

07:37.291 --> 07:38.458
I think it would
probably be safer for me

07:38.583 --> 07:40.585
to be out searching drug
infested neighborhoods.

07:40.710 --> 07:41.711
You kidding me?
Sam's asleep.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.630
It will be cake.
(baby crying)

07:43.755 --> 07:45.173
Oh, loud, screaming cake.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.342
(groaning)

07:51.972 --> 07:52.973
(sighs)

07:54.308 --> 07:56.059
I checked around back, too.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.477
There's no sign of her.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.106
You okay?

08:01.231 --> 08:03.650
Harry, Dixon had sex.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.859
Yes.

08:04.985 --> 08:05.860
He did. That...

08:05.986 --> 08:07.070
He did.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.655
And we had no clue.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.823
Which is normal.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.574
Teenage boys don't run
and tell their parents

08:11.699 --> 08:12.742
when they've had sex,

08:12.867 --> 08:13.952
and if they do, well,

08:14.077 --> 08:14.953
they're peculiar.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.371
I guess.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.957
Look, sweetheart,
a lot of what's going on

08:19.082 --> 08:21.001
is not normal, but

08:21.126 --> 08:22.710
Dixon not telling us is.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.338
Trust me.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.505
RYAN:
Think. Where would she go?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.341
I am thinking. It still
doesn't make sense to me

08:27.466 --> 08:28.758
why she would go
to your apartment.

08:28.883 --> 08:29.926
It doesn't make sense

08:30.051 --> 08:31.345
because Silver wasn't
making sense.

08:31.470 --> 08:32.971
Okay, you know,
sensible was not

08:33.096 --> 08:35.182
the overall tone of that
particular interchange.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.015
Yeah, but there's got
to be some reason

08:36.140 --> 08:37.392
that she blames you.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.726
I'm telling you
I didn't do anything.

08:38.852 --> 08:39.852
That you know of.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.104
Some people aren't aware

08:41.229 --> 08:42.188
of how they hurt people.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.191
Aren't aware or don't care.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.193
Your sister breaks
into my apartment,

08:46.318 --> 08:47.735
threatens me,
throws a wine bottle

08:47.861 --> 08:49.112
at my head,
and you're blaming me?

08:49.237 --> 08:50.364
You are the one who

08:50.489 --> 08:51.990
left her alone.
You are the reason

08:52.115 --> 08:53.367
we are out here looking
for her right now.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.202
She lives with you,
Kelly, not me, okay?

08:55.327 --> 08:57.245
You're the one who's supposed
to be taking care of her.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.710
Maybe we should
check the pier.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.170
Yeah, fine.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.302
Is he asleep?

09:12.427 --> 09:14.929
Eyes closed,

Mm-hmm?

09:35.825 --> 09:36.868
Sammy's not a baby, okay?

09:36.993 --> 09:37.911
He's four.

the little thing.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.932
And after that,
I think it's probably best

09:59.057 --> 10:01.309
that I pass on the baton,
you know?

10:01.435 --> 10:03.103
Pass baton?

10:03.228 --> 10:06.731
You mean... adoption?

10:06.856 --> 10:09.109
Yeah, I'm leaning
towards it...

10:09.234 --> 10:11.027
pretty strongly.

10:11.152 --> 10:14.822
Pretty much horizontal
toward adoption, yep.

I mean.

the hip-hop awards

Oh, it's where Dixon's from.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.469
Wait, you don't know
Dixon. Of course not.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.679
Well, neither do
I, apparently.

18:58.805 --> 18:59.722
That's the problem.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.223
How do you know anybody?

19:01.348 --> 19:02.683
You have to go backwards

19:02.809 --> 19:05.728
in order to understand
how to go forwards.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.272
So, working backwards.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.691
Why didn't Dixon
react to the movie

19:10.817 --> 19:12.652
the way that I
thought he would?

19:12.777 --> 19:14.695
Because there are
fundamental things about him

19:14.821 --> 19:16.697
that I don't understand.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.907
It's like chemistry.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.034
Like baking soda and vinegar.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.788
You can put vinegar with
something other than baking soda

19:23.913 --> 19:24.998
and it won't react the same way.

19:25.123 --> 19:28.501
So, my movie, in this example,
is the vinegar,

19:28.626 --> 19:30.920
which means, inherently,
that it's not a bad movie

19:31.045 --> 19:33.506
because if-if Dixon was sugar,

19:33.631 --> 19:34.590
then everything
would have been fine,

19:34.715 --> 19:35.716
but he's not.

19:35.842 --> 19:36.717
He's the baking soda.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.177
Hence his eruption.

19:38.302 --> 19:42.890
So, I have to understand
what makes Dixon baking soda.

19:43.016 --> 19:46.435
And how do you understand how
anyone becomes who they are?

19:46.560 --> 19:49.438
You have to go back

19:49.563 --> 19:52.566
to the past, all of their
previous chemical reactions.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.235
Imagine all the moments

19:55.361 --> 19:56.612
in Dixon's life
that made him who he is.

19:56.737 --> 19:57.947
All the moments

19:58.072 --> 19:59.281
and-and the moments
that lead

19:59.406 --> 20:00.616
up to those moments because

20:00.741 --> 20:02.785
there are no
disconnected moments.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.787
Every moment is connected
to a million other moments.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.833
God, it's... exhausting.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.127
But if you track
them back, you find

20:11.251 --> 20:14.588
the original moment,
the source of everything,

20:14.714 --> 20:15.798
which is...

20:15.923 --> 20:18.509
MAN:
Next in line.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.636
Kansas.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.513
I'm going to Kansas.

20:23.764 --> 20:24.807
Here.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.642
I have to get to Kansas.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.730
11:35, track 12.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.107
Thank you.
You're welcome.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.948
(child crying)

20:42.909 --> 20:44.952
I want my mommy.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.787
Quick, baby whisperer,
do something.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.873
Hey, Sammy.

20:48.998 --> 20:49.957
It's okay.
I want my mommy.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.625
Adrianna can help you.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.586
Hey, Sammy.

20:53.711 --> 20:54.837
Everybody, stop crying.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.338
Stop crying.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.925
He's turning pink.
Is that normal?

21:00.634 --> 21:02.469
Wait, shh, shh.
It's okay. Um...

21:02.595 --> 21:04.597
Look. Look, look.

21:04.722 --> 21:05.639
Big smiling face!

21:05.765 --> 21:06.807
Put it away.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.893
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.020
Uh, I am dying here.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.480
Couch.
Okay.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.691
Those are really cool PJs.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.568
You look sharp.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.819
Is that... what do
you have on them?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.029
Is that trucks?

21:20.154 --> 21:21.447
Oh, my gosh.
I love trucks.

21:21.572 --> 21:22.573
That's my favorite mode

21:22.698 --> 21:24.324
of transportation.
Tractors.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.785
Except for tractors.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.745
I was going to say that.
I just, I love them more.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.956
Sammy, do you know what
Adrianna's really good at?

21:30.081 --> 21:32.708
What?

21:34.961 --> 21:38.380
Opening my hands like a...

21:38.505 --> 21:41.259
Oh, reading books.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.928
I'm really good at
reading books to kids.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.680
It's actually a secret talent
of mine, actually, so...

21:46.806 --> 21:48.515
You want... You want us
to read this one?

21:48.641 --> 21:49.767
Picture book

21:49.892 --> 21:50.977
about, um, trucks?

21:51.102 --> 21:51.978
Tractors.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.562
Get with the program.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.022
Okay, uh...

21:55.148 --> 21:57.524
Sammy, Adrianna does
a great tractor voice.

21:59.026 --> 21:59.986
Hit it.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.071
(groaning)

22:02.196 --> 22:04.073
(gruffly):
I'm a tractor!

22:04.198 --> 22:06.075
I like to tract things.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.078
Professional actress
right there, Sammy.

22:09.203 --> 22:10.871
You should hear her do
a dump truck.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.081
(laughing)

22:12.206 --> 22:13.624
Anyways, let's get started.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.126
Do you want to move
closer to Navid?

22:15.251 --> 22:16.502
Would you be
more comfortable?

22:16.627 --> 22:18.462
Let's go.

22:18.587 --> 22:22.382
Okay...

22:22.508 --> 22:24.927
Once upon a time,
there lived

22:25.052 --> 22:25.970
a grouchy old tractor

22:26.095 --> 22:28.848
named Mr. Grumples.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.766
Look, it's Mr. Grumples.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.408
What are you doing?

22:48.534 --> 22:50.619
Just trying to open
Silver's locker.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.122
Here.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.498
She's had
the same combination

22:54.623 --> 22:55.541
since sixth grade.

22:59.837 --> 23:01.005
I don't know

23:01.130 --> 23:02.923
what I'm looking for.
This is all so weird.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.382
Yeah, I know, right?

23:10.973 --> 23:12.683
Oh, my God.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.018
I can't believe
she has that.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.602
That's you?

23:15.728 --> 23:16.937
Yeah, me and Silver.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.272
With what seems
to be pots on your heads?

23:18.396 --> 23:21.441
Yeah, we were
alone at my house,

23:21.567 --> 23:22.735
hanging out.

23:22.860 --> 23:23.944
I think we were, like, 12.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.863
We suddenly felt this

23:25.988 --> 23:28.908
huge earthquake and
totally freaked out

23:29.033 --> 23:30.076
and got a bunch of pots and ran
and hid under the kitchen table.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.119
Was it a big earthquake?

23:32.245 --> 23:33.662
Oh, no, it wasn't
an earthquake at all.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.915
Apparently, our neighbors
decided to upgrade

23:36.040 --> 23:37.250
to a pebble driveway

23:37.375 --> 23:39.626
and had been jackhammering
the pavement up next door.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.171
How long were you
under the table?

23:42.296 --> 23:43.630
At least an
hour, maybe two.

23:43.756 --> 23:44.924
I don't remember.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.967
Oh, I don't know how long
we would have been there

23:47.093 --> 23:49.720
if Ethan hadn't shown up to
tell us about the jackhammer.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.974
Anyway...

23:54.100 --> 23:56.185
Yeah, anyway,

23:56.310 --> 23:57.770
my dad said we
should keep looking.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.063
Yeah, I'm going to
go check the gym.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.660
(people chattering)

24:38.811 --> 24:40.562
(people chattering)

24:54.243 --> 24:56.245
(typing)

24:59.373 --> 25:02.376
(sighing)

25:08.048 --> 25:09.800
What are you doing?

25:09.925 --> 25:11.635
Honey, I'm trying to figure out
Dixon's password. I've tried

25:11.760 --> 25:13.346
his name, his birthday,
the Chiefs...

25:13.471 --> 25:14.638
Why do you need
to get into his...

25:14.763 --> 25:16.265
Because I have no idea
who he is, Harry.

25:16.390 --> 25:17.933
Deb, what's going on?
I have no clue

25:18.058 --> 25:19.643
what's going on.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.061
Our son is acting
like a stranger.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.355
You saw him down there.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.648
He is hostile and callous
and having sex.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.066
Okay, fine. Maybe

25:26.192 --> 25:27.985
that's normal,
but the rest of it is not.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.153
It's this place.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.946
It's L.A., Beverly Hills.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.198
The morals are
different here.

25:32.323 --> 25:34.283
I mean, kids grow up
way too fast,

25:34.408 --> 25:36.369
and we made a huge mistake
by coming here.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.539
Deb...
(cell phone ringing)

25:44.293 --> 25:45.836
Silver.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.087
Uh, no.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.130
Uh, my name is Kevin.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.715
But I'm here with a girl

25:49.840 --> 25:51.133
named Erin Silver.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.177
She's in a pretty bad way,

25:53.302 --> 25:54.761
and I-I just thought
I should call someone

25:54.887 --> 25:56.389
and let them know, and

25:56.514 --> 25:57.806
you know, this was
the last number she called.

25:57.931 --> 25:58.807
Where is she?

25:58.932 --> 25:59.975
Where are you?

26:00.100 --> 26:01.519
Union Station.

26:01.643 --> 26:04.063
Uh, Erin here bought herself
a ticket to Kansas.

26:04.188 --> 26:05.772
You know, her train
hasn't left yet.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.149
Right now, she's kind of

26:07.274 --> 26:10.403
passed out, but she's acting
pretty erratic

26:10.528 --> 26:11.778
and, I mean,
who knows what she might do?

26:11.904 --> 26:12.821
We're on our way.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.282
We will be there
as soon as we can.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.368
Yeah.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.829
MAN (over P.A.):
Train 416 to San Bernardino
exiting at platform four.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.208
Train 416...

26:24.333 --> 26:26.668
Look, we can't break up.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.170
What?

26:28.295 --> 26:29.963
Relationships are work and
that's all we need to do.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.424
We need to work on things.

26:31.549 --> 26:33.342
We shouldn't
give up so easily.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.177
But, Annie, things haven't been
good. We haven't been happy.

26:35.302 --> 26:37.096
I-I know, I know that.

26:37.221 --> 26:38.722
Okay, but we will be.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.099
We-we just have
to fix this.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.225
Okay? We have to.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.642
We have to work at this.

26:42.768 --> 26:43.810
Why?

26:43.936 --> 26:47.314
Why? Because...
Because of Naomi.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.649
Naomi's going
to find out eventually.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.152
Naomi's going to find out
about what?

26:52.278 --> 26:53.987
This isn't about

26:54.113 --> 26:55.197
Naomi finding out.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.198
This is about Naomi.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.492
When I first

26:58.616 --> 27:01.203
moved here, she reached out
to me and we had the potential

27:01.328 --> 27:03.330
to be friends,

27:03.456 --> 27:04.664
to be real
friends, and then

27:04.790 --> 27:05.999
she asked me not

27:06.125 --> 27:07.501
to go out with you,
but I...

27:07.625 --> 27:09.545
I didn't listen. I
went behind her back

27:09.669 --> 27:11.088
and I started dating
you, which is a really

27:11.213 --> 27:12.839
jerky thing to do.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.091
But I did it.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.176
because I had
a good reason.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.012
I believed that
you were the one.

27:19.138 --> 27:23.183
I thought... I thought
that we were the ones.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.895
Our relationship, you and
me, it was worth anything.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.147
It was worth

27:28.272 --> 27:30.149
sacrificing friends
and even some of my

27:30.274 --> 27:31.775
self-respect.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.735
But if we're not together,
and we break up,

27:33.860 --> 27:35.070
then what?

27:35.195 --> 27:36.363
Then I didn't

27:36.489 --> 27:39.366
make these sacrifices

27:39.492 --> 27:41.952
for our relationship.
I was just being a jerk.

27:44.246 --> 27:47.541
If we can't
make things work,

27:47.665 --> 27:49.876
then I have to accept
everything that I've done.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.505
And... and...

27:56.842 --> 27:58.885
And we are.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.431
We are... we are broken up.

28:05.851 --> 28:09.980
And... and I've been a jerk.

28:10.105 --> 28:13.817
I've been a jerk,
and... me and Ethan?

28:18.238 --> 28:19.281
We're broken up.

28:32.503 --> 28:33.837
It's okay, Erin.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.047
How do you know my name?

28:36.340 --> 28:38.717
What time is it?

28:40.553 --> 28:41.928
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.931
I got to go!
I got to go.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.728
Erin! Wait!

28:54.483 --> 28:56.485
(train whistle blowing)

28:58.111 --> 29:00.989
No! Stop, stop, stop!

29:01.114 --> 29:02.949
Don't leave without me!

29:03.075 --> 29:04.410
Stop!

29:04.535 --> 29:06.370
Please!

29:06.495 --> 29:07.787
Silver!

29:07.913 --> 29:09.498
Silver, get off the tracks.

29:09.623 --> 29:10.916
It was my train.

29:11.041 --> 29:14.086
First Ryan drained

29:14.211 --> 29:16.338
my gas tank, and then
I missed my train.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.965
And I am never going
to make it to Kansas.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.093
HARRY:
Okay, Silver, calm down.
It doesn't matter

29:21.218 --> 29:22.386
if you missed your train.

29:22.511 --> 29:23.262
She's such a drama queen.
Hey.

29:23.387 --> 29:24.388
It's unbelievable.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.306
How could you say that?

29:26.432 --> 29:28.141
Well, I had it all figured out.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.894
I was going to go
to Kansas because

29:31.019 --> 29:33.480
Kansas equals Dixon,

29:33.606 --> 29:36.900
and Dixon equals baking soda.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.194
Doesn't make sense...

29:39.319 --> 29:41.154
But it did, it
did make sense,

29:41.280 --> 29:42.239
and now it doesn't.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.324
I know.
Don't!

29:44.450 --> 29:45.451
Don't come near me.

29:45.576 --> 29:47.661
Okay.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.830
Everything was making sense,
but now it doesn't.

29:50.956 --> 29:54.042
Everything was so great,

29:54.167 --> 29:56.336
but now it's so dark.

29:58.464 --> 30:01.467
It is so dark here.

30:01.592 --> 30:03.469
It is always, always dark.

30:03.594 --> 30:05.471
HARRY:
Silver, please
get off the tracks.

30:05.596 --> 30:07.347
SILVER:
I am so confused.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.933
HARRY:
Silver.
I don't know what's

30:10.058 --> 30:12.018
going on anymore.
Silver, get off the tracks.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.186
(train whistle blowing)

30:13.312 --> 30:14.813
Silver!
Silver!

30:14.938 --> 30:16.523
(train approaching)
You don't understand!

30:16.649 --> 30:19.985
Silver, no!
DEBBIE: No!

30:33.540 --> 30:35.208
Dixon!
Wait, wait.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.835
I got this.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.922
Silver! It's me.

30:41.047 --> 30:45.469
It's Dixon. Listen,
I do understand.

30:45.594 --> 30:48.263
I do! Everything
was so good for you,

30:48.388 --> 30:55.437
and now it feels like the world
is crumbling around you.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.147
Everything made sense,

30:57.272 --> 30:59.733
and now it doesn't,
but it's okay, Silver.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.194
I know what
you're going through,

31:02.319 --> 31:04.404
'cause my mom used to go
through the same type of thing.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.533
Some days,

31:07.658 --> 31:10.994
she was so happy,
she couldn't contain herself.

31:11.119 --> 31:14.247
Like, one day, she just
took me out of school.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.624
Just showed up
in the middle
of the day

31:15.749 --> 31:17.584
and took me out of school.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.503
Said we were going
to Disneyland.

31:19.628 --> 31:22.172
But she didn't stay happy.

31:22.297 --> 31:28.303
By the time we got there,
she was just sad and confused.

31:28.428 --> 31:32.182
We didn't end up
leaving the motel room.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.267
That's how she was.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.019
Up and down,

31:36.144 --> 31:37.187
up and down.

31:43.151 --> 31:46.655
But that wasn't her fault.

31:46.780 --> 31:49.366
She just needed help, Silver.

31:49.491 --> 31:53.787
It's okay, all right?
I'm here.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.789
And I'm going to help you
get help.

31:57.499 --> 31:58.751
All right?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.674
(sobs softly)

32:05.799 --> 32:08.009
Everything's
gonna be okay.

32:20.731 --> 32:25.193
MAN (over P.A.):
Train 416 to San Bernardino
exiting at platform four.

32:25.318 --> 32:28.196
Hey...

32:28.321 --> 32:30.574
Kelly, I'm so sorry.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.492
I screwed it
all up, didn't I?

32:32.618 --> 32:35.203
You let me
in your house,

32:35.328 --> 32:37.372
you gave me a chance,
try to make things better,

32:37.497 --> 32:38.749
and I screwed it all up.

32:38.874 --> 32:41.209
You're gonna get rid
of me, aren't you?

32:41.334 --> 32:43.086
You're gonna send me back
to my mom.
No, no, no.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.964
I'm not going anywhere,
and neither are you.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.593
DEBBIE:
Are you okay?

32:49.718 --> 32:53.430
She's manic-depressive.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.933
It's not drugs.

32:56.057 --> 33:00.562
Silver has bipolar disorder
just like my birth mom.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.397
That has to be it.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.702
Well, I'm just glad
she's safe.

33:15.828 --> 33:18.664
Yeah, it's a huge relief.

33:18.789 --> 33:19.748
I'll drop you off
at home.

33:19.873 --> 33:20.749
Okay.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.375
No, I'll take her.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.794
Are you sure?

33:23.919 --> 33:25.420
Yeah. I mean,
it's on the way home.

33:25.545 --> 33:26.379
Well, sort of.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.714
Thanks.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.342
Bye, Ethan.

33:30.467 --> 33:31.844
Bye, Annie.

33:33.386 --> 33:37.516
So, there are a lot of
other fish in the sea.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.225
Mm.
Equally cute fish.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.144
Yeah, well, thanks.

33:41.269 --> 33:45.315
And, um, I really am sorry
about how I acted.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.566
I get it.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.151
It's okay. Trust me,

33:48.276 --> 33:50.654
I wasn't exactly the
nicest person either.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.322
I mean, nice is
not really my thing.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.490
No, it's not.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.784
But still,
I'm sorry, too.

33:55.909 --> 33:58.578
Thank you...
I guess.
(laughs)

34:00.330 --> 34:02.081
Okay, not to gossip
or anything,

34:02.207 --> 34:03.542
but have you heard

34:03.667 --> 34:05.502
what Adrianna calls Navid?

34:05.627 --> 34:07.253
"Sesame Balls."

34:07.379 --> 34:08.463
What?

34:08.588 --> 34:09.464
Sesame Balls!

34:09.589 --> 34:10.757
No way.
Sesame Balls!

34:16.929 --> 34:18.806
And what is
your relationship
to the patient?

34:18.931 --> 34:20.559
I'm her sister.

34:20.684 --> 34:22.060
"And he went into the barn

34:22.185 --> 34:26.438
"and who did he find there
but Mr. Grumples,

34:26.565 --> 34:31.444
"looking all spiffy with a shiny
new coat of bright red paint.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.279
The end."

34:33.405 --> 34:35.614
Aw, he was a nice
tractor after all.
Shh!

34:35.741 --> 34:37.199
He's out.

34:37.324 --> 34:40.328
Oh! When did he fall asleep?

34:40.453 --> 34:43.456
Back when Mr. Grumples
was crossing the bridge

34:43.581 --> 34:44.541
to Jersey City.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.208
Oh, I wanted, I wanted to see

34:46.333 --> 34:47.377
how it turned out.

34:47.502 --> 34:50.380
This was actually kind of fun.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.091
Yeah. We make
a pretty good team.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.094
Yeah, we do.

35:17.365 --> 35:18.658
Oh, hey.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.869
Hey.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.622
How is she?

35:23.747 --> 35:25.123
She's gonna be okay.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.542
You didn't have to stay.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.753
A chauffeur is not done

35:29.878 --> 35:32.422
until his charge is
safely back at home.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.590
Look, Ryan,

35:33.715 --> 35:35.675
I owe you an apology for the way
I treated you.

35:35.801 --> 35:36.718
No, Kelly,

35:36.843 --> 35:38.386
I owe you an apology.

35:38.511 --> 35:41.264
I haven't really
been your friend.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.601
I slept with Brenda,

35:44.726 --> 35:47.228
which I knew
would hurt you...

35:47.353 --> 35:48.438
which is why I did it.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.273
I had feelings

35:50.398 --> 35:51.357
for you, Kelly,

35:51.483 --> 35:53.276
and then you went to see Dylan
and...

35:53.401 --> 35:54.402
It doesn't matter

35:54.527 --> 35:57.072
'cause you didn't
owe me anything.

35:57.196 --> 36:03.161
And I was stupid and spiteful...
and I'm really sorry.

36:07.791 --> 36:11.461
And I realize it's
completely unprofessional
for a chauffeur

36:11.586 --> 36:16.466
to try and befriend his charge,
but... I'd like to.

36:21.054 --> 36:23.348
I'd like that, too.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.643
But I'm still gonna sit

36:26.768 --> 36:27.853
in the back seat
on the way home.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.688
Okay.

36:41.616 --> 36:42.742
Dixon was great
out there.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.661
I know. He was.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.496
Can you imagine
what that would be like?

36:46.621 --> 36:48.165
First your birth mother,

36:48.289 --> 36:49.958
and then your girlfriend both
being manic-depressive?

36:50.083 --> 36:51.584
It'd be like lightning
striking twice.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.879
It's no wonder he reacted
the way he did.

36:54.004 --> 36:55.964
Oh, yeah.

36:56.089 --> 37:01.136
Listen, I'm sorry
I kind of lost it before.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.721
Oh, no, honey, it's okay.
It's understandable.

37:03.972 --> 37:07.100
But I think that we should talk,

37:07.225 --> 37:09.352
you know? If you're unhappy
in L.A., we can leave.

37:09.477 --> 37:10.770
But you can't keep
bringing it up

37:10.896 --> 37:12.814
every time something
goes wrong.
I know.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.316
We haven't taken the
bid on the house.

37:15.441 --> 37:16.818
We can move back
to Kansas

37:16.943 --> 37:18.570
if that's what you want.

37:18.695 --> 37:19.738
But we can't have

37:19.863 --> 37:20.906
one foot here and
one foot there.

37:21.031 --> 37:22.991
We have to decide.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.993
What do you want?

37:25.118 --> 37:28.580
Me? I like it here.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.708
And I think it is a great place

37:31.833 --> 37:33.960
to raise our kids.

37:34.086 --> 37:35.670
And I think the kids in Kansas

37:35.795 --> 37:36.838
have sex, too.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.423
I know, I know they do.

37:38.548 --> 37:40.842
And I like it
here, too.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.844
But the most important thing
for me is whether or not

37:42.969 --> 37:45.513
this is a good place
to raise a family.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.140
And I think it is.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.601
There are opportunities
and culture

37:49.726 --> 37:52.562
and all sorts of things here
that you can't find in Kansas.

37:52.687 --> 37:56.816
Museums and galleries
and theater and...

37:56.942 --> 37:58.151
gluten-free bread.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.486
And I don't even know
what gluten is,

38:00.612 --> 38:02.989
but I like the option
of not having to eat it.

38:03.115 --> 38:04.490
I like options.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.952
And Beverly Hills has options.

38:07.077 --> 38:09.037
It's a bigger world here.

38:09.162 --> 38:10.872
And I think that's a good thing.

38:10.997 --> 38:14.751
You think we should stay
in Beverly Hills?

38:14.876 --> 38:17.629
I think that we should stay

38:17.754 --> 38:19.589
in Beverly Hills.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.424
Well, it sounds like
you were pretty amazing.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.009
Nah.

38:23.135 --> 38:25.344
And not at first,
for sure.

38:25.470 --> 38:29.182
When Silver called,
I totally bugged out.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.977
You know,
she just kept going on,

38:32.102 --> 38:35.230
saying I was the only thing
that made her life worth living.

38:35.354 --> 38:37.899
And it was that kind of
manipulative thing

38:38.024 --> 38:39.818
that my mom used to say to me.

38:39.943 --> 38:43.905
You know,
so I just had a bad

38:44.030 --> 38:46.825
reaction
and just freaked out.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.243
Did you know
that then?

38:48.367 --> 38:51.871
I mean, did you know
why you were upset?

38:51.997 --> 38:54.791
No, I had no clue.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.501
I mean, didn't put it all
together

38:56.626 --> 38:57.961
until we were
at the train station.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.922
Then I guess

39:01.047 --> 39:02.465
I saw how she shifted

39:02.590 --> 39:06.803
from being so happy
to being so despondent.

39:06.928 --> 39:08.638
It all made sense.

39:08.763 --> 39:11.057
Geez, what a night.

39:11.183 --> 39:13.852
You can say that again.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.103
What a night.

39:15.228 --> 39:16.771
You can say that again again.

39:16.896 --> 39:18.356
(both laugh)
What a night.

39:19.941 --> 39:23.903
DEBBIE:
Ooh, French toast.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.446
Whoo!
Yum.

39:25.571 --> 39:26.739
I'm starving.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.867
The bread is gluten-free.

39:28.992 --> 39:30.368
I will explain later.

39:30.493 --> 39:33.746
ANNIE:
Oh, whatever. Yum.
I could eat a house.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.623
How about some
French toast?

39:35.748 --> 39:37.625
Drown it!
(all laugh)

39:37.750 --> 39:39.252
I say, drown it.
Literally, really.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.920
We're gonna all die
of a diabetic coma.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.672
Oh, my goodness.
(all laugh)

39:42.797 --> 39:44.590
All right, now let's see
if we can taste the difference.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.259
HARRY: With?
No gluten. I don't
know what that is,

39:46.384 --> 39:47.760
but I know there's
no gluten in that.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.221
HARRY:
Gluten is a carbohydrate.
ANNIE: Really?
