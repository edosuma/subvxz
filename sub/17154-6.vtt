11:30.542 --> 11:32.875
[groans]
OK.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.375
I need to tell Macy the truth.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
We'll go with you for support.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.500
-You're gonna need it.
-[drum riff]

11:41.875 --> 11:43.375
Aww.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.500
Whoa!
Hey, Frankie.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.375
You're a sneaky little devil, aren't you?

11:56.208 --> 11:57.250
Happy?

11:58.500 --> 12:01.250
What? What is this?
Is this your brothers down there?

12:01.333 --> 12:02.250
You can barely see them.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.542
That's why it comes with this!

12:07.208 --> 12:10.709
Oh, sure, sure.
Try again.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.166
This keeps him out of jail.

12:27.125 --> 12:28.500
Oh, hey!

12:28.583 --> 12:30.417
OK, champ, there's Macy.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.542
OK.

12:34.792 --> 12:37.625
All right, you can do this.
Just tell the truth.

12:37.709 --> 12:39.583
-OK.
-The truth will set us free...

12:39.667 --> 12:42.291
-From her terrible singing.
-Gonna tell the truth.

12:42.375 --> 12:45.625
-Gonna set us free.
-Eye of the tiger, eye of the tiger!

12:45.709 --> 12:47.333
[spits]
OK, let's do this!

12:47.417 --> 12:49.083
[bell rings]

12:51.333 --> 12:54.625
-OK.
-[deep voice] Um, hello, Mace.

12:54.709 --> 12:58.917
Oh!
[giggles] Sorry.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.083
Um, the thing...
[clears throat]

13:02.166 --> 13:05.917
The thing is I need to
talk to you about your singing.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.417
-My singing?
-[books thump]

13:07.500 --> 13:08.834
Oh, sorry.

13:10.166 --> 13:12.375
-Whoa!
-Oh, sorry.

13:13.625 --> 13:15.875
-[giggles]
-The thing is...

13:15.959 --> 13:17.875
Your singing, it really...

13:24.000 --> 13:26.542
What Kevin's trying to say is...

13:27.375 --> 13:29.417
are you still singing backup
for us tonight?

13:30.792 --> 13:34.208
-Yeah, totally!
-Cool. See you there.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.667
What happened to setting us free?

13:38.750 --> 13:40.583
Yeah, dude.
I was just about to tell her the truth.

13:40.667 --> 13:42.542
All you were about to do was pass out.

13:42.625 --> 13:45.375
And it doesn't matter anyway
because I have a new idea,

13:45.458 --> 13:48.333
-and it's foolproof.
-That means even I can't mess it up.

13:48.417 --> 13:52.208
We let Macy record on the song,
but we don't use her voice.

13:52.291 --> 13:55.250
She won't know the difference,
so she won't get her feelings hurt.

13:55.333 --> 13:58.750
-Well, what about Malcolm Meckle?
-Malcolm Meckle mustn't meet Macy Misa.

13:59.792 --> 14:01.458
See what I did there with all the "M"s?

14:01.542 --> 14:03.208
-Yeah, dude, we saw.
-Impressive.

14:03.291 --> 14:06.709
Anyway, we bring Macy in a little early,
she's gone before Malcolm even gets there.

14:06.792 --> 14:11.208
-Dude, you're a genius.
-Actually three points shy of a genius.

14:11.291 --> 14:12.792
But who's counting?

14:14.500 --> 14:15.750
Is he really a genius?

14:15.834 --> 14:18.083
That's what Mom says
every time she gets mad at me.

14:26.542 --> 14:29.375
Hey, you know what?
I like that.

14:30.125 --> 14:32.333
Now you've captured the family
team spirit perfectly.

14:32.417 --> 14:34.291
-Good job.
-For real?

14:34.375 --> 14:37.458
-So real, we have a deal.
-Sign here.

14:40.291 --> 14:42.000
You are adorable.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.250

15:14.417 --> 15:19.166
I can't believe I'm actually
in an actual Jonas recording studio.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.333
Neither can we.

15:21.625 --> 15:24.750
So run us through this one more time.
She opens her mouth and...?

15:24.834 --> 15:27.291
It kinda hits you before you hear it,

15:27.375 --> 15:30.208
and then there's a flash
of blinding white light,

15:30.291 --> 15:32.959
and in about ten seconds
you're gonna pass out.

15:33.041 --> 15:35.041
But there's no symptoms
of vertigo or nausea, right?

15:35.125 --> 15:38.041
No, no, no, I just got really
dizzy and then I puked.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.583
OK, let's do this.

-Listen to that sound.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.500
That's what I'm talking about!

That's not what I'm talking about.

16:08.208 --> 16:12.750
I don't want to talk about that.
Make it stop, make it stop!

16:14.875 --> 16:19.458

[Joe] All right, Macy, thank you,
that was great.

16:22.709 --> 16:24.041
We'll see you in a second.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.417
Great?
Do you know what you're talking about?

16:27.500 --> 16:29.417
I don't think that's
what you're talking about,

16:29.500 --> 16:31.834
'cause that's not what
I'm talking about.

16:31.917 --> 16:34.709
Look, we know she's awful.
But she's a friend we said we'd record.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.417
We have to talk about this.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.500
We're not even gonna use it
on the CD anyway.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.417
We know Macy isn't the greatest singer.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.083
As soon as we were finished recording,
we were gonna erase her voice,

16:46.166 --> 16:48.542
and no one will ever
have to hear her singing again.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.625
We were just trying to get through this
without hurting her feelings.

16:52.583 --> 16:56.291
Well, that's all very considerate,
but she's standing right there.

17:03.792 --> 17:04.875
Macy, I...

"Sorry we crushed your dream of singing."

17:22.208 --> 17:25.667
Although this is freakishly accurate,
I don't think a greeting card

17:25.750 --> 17:27.291
is going to make everything OK.

17:28.166 --> 17:31.500
Great job, guys.
Macy's devastated.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.250
Don't worry, we feel
just as terrible as you'd hope.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.250
Actually, we feel worse.

17:36.333 --> 17:40.333
I ate three gallons of chocolate coma
ice cream last night.

17:40.417 --> 17:44.333
Ohh... I have to admit that I feel better
that you feel terrible.

17:45.959 --> 17:46.917
But now that I feel better,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.166
I feel guilty for feeling good
that you feel bad.

17:50.375 --> 17:51.250
What?

17:52.417 --> 17:53.834
I got it.

17:55.125 --> 17:58.375
What I'm trying to say is
I'll talk to Macy for you

17:58.458 --> 18:00.291
and try to make everything better.

18:01.375 --> 18:02.458
OK.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.083
Wait, wait, wait.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.709
I'll talk to Macy.

18:10.041 --> 18:11.875
It's what I should have done
in the first place.

18:11.959 --> 18:14.625
-OK.
-Here I go.

18:14.709 --> 18:18.083
-Good luck.
-Thanks. I can do this.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.792

Hi, Macy.

18:47.291 --> 18:48.291
I, um...

18:54.583 --> 18:56.542
I want to apologize.

18:57.959 --> 18:59.959
I really didn't
want to hurt your feelings,

19:00.041 --> 19:03.041
and... I made it way worse.

19:03.125 --> 19:06.917
I... I should have been straight up
with you from the very beginning.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.125
I'm so sorry I wasn't.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.166
I can't believe it!

19:14.291 --> 19:17.417
An actual Jonas feels terrible for me!

19:19.375 --> 19:21.417
I feel bad that you feel terrible.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.834
-Oh.
-No! No, no, it's...

19:23.917 --> 19:28.208
OK, OK. How about we both
stop feeling bad for each other?

19:28.959 --> 19:31.458
And that we start in a new place?

19:32.583 --> 19:35.792

-[gasps] Yay!

Hey, Macy.

What's going on?
I thought you'd still be really upset.

19:51.083 --> 19:56.166
Oh, I feel better because Kevin
apologized... to me. [giggles]

19:58.709 --> 20:01.291
And, Stella, none of this
would have ever happened

20:01.375 --> 20:04.750
if you would have told me I wasn't
a good singer in the first place.

20:04.834 --> 20:08.166
-But you're so sensitive.
-I can handle a little criticism.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.750
You remember that basketball game
when I missed a shot at the buzzer

20:11.834 --> 20:13.542
and we ended up losing by one point?

20:13.625 --> 20:15.291
Oh, yeah, of course I do.

You got it, sister.

I promise to tell the truth,

20:34.583 --> 20:38.041
no matter how bad it... hurts.

20:38.125 --> 20:39.709
Oh, really?

20:39.792 --> 20:43.125
Then tell me what you
honestly think of my sweater.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.542

[high-pitched] I love it!

-It's so obvious he doesn't like it.
-I know.

20:56.417 --> 20:58.834

gets all high when he's lying.

I was thinking, I love singing so much,

21:36.291 --> 21:39.709
I don't see why I have to stop
just 'cause I'm terrible at it. [chuckles]

21:39.792 --> 21:41.583
