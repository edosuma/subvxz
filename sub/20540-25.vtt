>> John: WELCOME,

00:33.900 --> 00:34.967
WELCOME, WELCOME

00:34.967 --> 00:36.834
TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:36.834 --> 00:37.400
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:38.000 --> 00:39.367
FOR JOINING US.

00:39.367 --> 00:41.166
AND WE MUST BEGIN WITH

00:41.166 --> 00:42.500
PUERTO RICO, WHERE MORE THAN

00:42.500 --> 00:44.233
3 MILLION AMERICAN CITIZENS

00:44.233 --> 00:45.166
CONTINUE TO COPE WITH THE

00:45.166 --> 00:46.667
AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE MARIA.

00:46.667 --> 00:48.200
THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE HAS

00:48.200 --> 00:50.100
BEEN WIDELY CRITICIZED THIS

00:50.100 --> 00:51.033
WEEK, AND IT STILL DOESN'T SEEM

00:51.033 --> 00:51.934
ENTIRELY CLEAR THAT HE

00:51.934 --> 00:52.600
UNDERSTANDS THE GRAVITY

00:52.600 --> 00:54.700
OF THE SITUATION.

00:54.700 --> 00:55.800
>> THE LOSS OF LIFE

00:55.800 --> 00:57.600
IS ALWAYS TRAGIC.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.633
BUT IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE.

01:00.633 --> 01:02.400
THE RESULTS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH

01:02.400 --> 01:03.967
RESPECT TO LOSS OF LIFE.

01:03.967 --> 01:06.300
PEOPLE CAN'T BELIEVE

01:06.300 --> 01:07.734
HOW SUCCESSFUL THAT HAS BEEN,

01:07.734 --> 01:10.767
RELATIVELY SPEAKING.

01:10.767 --> 01:11.967
>> John: HOW ARE YOU EVEN TRYING

01:11.967 --> 01:14.033
TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP RIGHT NOW?

01:14.033 --> 01:15.433
THE ONLY WAY HE COULD'VE SAVED

01:15.433 --> 01:16.767
THAT STATEMENT IS IF HE ADDED,

01:16.767 --> 01:17.767
"AND DON'T FORGET.

01:17.767 --> 01:18.867
I JUST KIND OF RAMBLE.

01:18.867 --> 01:20.000
I KNOW NOTHING.

01:20.000 --> 01:20.800
I TALK BECAUSE SILENCE

01:20.800 --> 01:22.033
SOUNDS WEIRD.

01:22.033 --> 01:24.367
THINK OF ME AS A PARROT

01:24.367 --> 01:25.600
WHO MEMORIZED SOME HUMAN SOUNDS.

01:25.600 --> 01:26.667
YABBA DABBA DOO,

01:26.667 --> 01:29.400
JUMANJI, BYE-BYE."

01:29.400 --> 01:32.066
AND LOOK, GETTING AID

01:32.066 --> 01:33.166
TO A DISASTER ZONE

01:33.166 --> 01:34.700
IS A HUGE CHALLENGE.

01:34.700 --> 01:35.967
BUT TRUMP'S ROSY ASSESSMENT OF

01:35.967 --> 01:37.600
SUCCESS HAS BEEN DISPUTED BY

01:37.600 --> 01:38.767
MANY ON THE GROUND,

01:38.767 --> 01:40.166
LIKE SAN JUAN MAYOR

01:40.166 --> 01:42.100
CARMEN YULIN CRUZ, WHO WENT ON

01:42.100 --> 01:45.066
TV TO PLEAD FOR MORE AID, WHICH

01:45.066 --> 01:46.767
GOT A DEPRESSINGLY PREDICTABLE

01:46.767 --> 01:48.100
RESPONSE FROM THE PRESIDENT.

01:48.100 --> 01:48.867
>> THE PRESIDENT UP EARLY THIS

01:48.867 --> 01:49.667
MORNING AND TWEETING ABOUT

01:49.667 --> 01:52.066
PUERTO RICO.

01:52.066 --> 01:52.800
>> "SUCH POOR LEADERSHIP ABILITY

01:52.800 --> 01:54.000
BY THE MAYOR OF SAN JUAN

01:54.000 --> 01:55.133
AND OTHERS IN PUERTO RICO

01:55.133 --> 01:56.333
WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THEIR

01:56.333 --> 01:57.533
WORKERS TO HELP.

01:57.533 --> 01:58.700
THEY WANT EVERYTHING TO BE DONE

01:58.700 --> 02:00.200
FOR THEM WHEN IT SHOULD BE

02:00.200 --> 02:02.100
A COMMUNITY EFFORT."

02:02.100 --> 02:04.967
>> John: REALLY?

02:04.967 --> 02:07.300
REALLY?

02:07.300 --> 02:08.033
THE PRIMARY OBSTACLE TO

02:08.033 --> 02:09.233
HURRICANE RELIEF HAS BEEN

02:09.233 --> 02:10.367
PUERTO RICAN "LAZINESS"?

02:10.367 --> 02:12.000
YOU'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO TRUMP.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
ANYBODY CAN SAY HORRIBLE RACIST

02:13.000 --> 02:14.533
THINGS ABOUT HISPANIC PEOPLE

02:14.533 --> 02:15.734
ON A GOLDEN ESCALATOR.

02:15.734 --> 02:17.633
BUT IT TAKES BALLS TO DO IT

02:17.633 --> 02:18.433
WHILE THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS

02:18.433 --> 02:21.200
ARE DYING.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.066
TRUMP IS BASICALLY SAYING,

02:22.066 --> 02:23.400
"WHEN HURRICANES HIT OUR PEOPLE,

02:23.400 --> 02:25.400
THEY'RE NOT HITTING OUR BEST.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.100
THEY'RE KILLING POORS.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.233
THEY'RE KILLING LAZIES.

02:27.233 --> 02:28.333
AND SOME, I ASSUME, HAVE SAID

02:28.333 --> 02:31.600
NICE THINGS ABOUT ME."

02:31.600 --> 02:32.834
AND THIS DEBACLE CAME AT THE END

02:32.834 --> 02:33.834
OF A WEEK OF EMBARRASSMENTS

02:33.834 --> 02:35.033
FOR TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION

02:35.033 --> 02:36.266
FROM THE RESIGNATION OF

02:36.266 --> 02:37.400
TOM PRICE TO THE FAILURE OF

02:37.400 --> 02:38.867
THE GRAHAM-CASSIDY HEALTH CARE

02:38.867 --> 02:40.033
BILL IN THE SENATE.

02:40.033 --> 02:42.233
ALTHOUGH TO HEAR TRUMP TELL IT,

02:42.233 --> 02:44.166
THERE'S A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THAT.

02:44.166 --> 02:45.533
>> WE HAVE ONE SENATOR

02:45.533 --> 02:46.934
THAT'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

02:46.934 --> 02:47.900
HE CAN'T VOTE BECAUSE HE'S

02:47.900 --> 02:49.266
IN THE HOSPITAL.

02:49.266 --> 02:49.767
>> ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

02:49.767 --> 02:50.800
COCHRAN?

02:50.800 --> 02:51.467
>> HE CAN'T VOTE BECAUSE

02:51.467 --> 02:53.500
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.433
I'M ALMOST CERTAIN WE HAVE

02:54.433 --> 02:56.033
THE VOTES.

02:56.033 --> 02:56.834
BUT WITH ONE MAN IN THE

02:56.834 --> 02:58.333
HOSPITAL, WE CANNOT DISPLAY

02:58.333 --> 02:59.700
THAT WE HAVE THEM.

02:59.700 --> 03:00.867
WE CAN'T DO IT NOW BECAUSE WE

03:00.867 --> 03:02.633
HAVE SOMEBODY IN THE HOSPITAL.

03:02.633 --> 03:03.734
>> SIR, WHO IS IN THE HOSPITAL?

03:03.734 --> 03:04.767
WHICH SENATOR ARE YOU REFERRING

03:04.767 --> 03:05.500
TO?

03:05.500 --> 03:06.734
>> BECAUSE HE CAN'T COME HERE

03:06.734 --> 03:07.400
AND VOTE.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.600
IN OTHER WORDS, HE CAN'T COME

03:08.600 --> 03:09.200
HERE AND VOTE BECAUSE HE IS

03:09.200 --> 03:10.133
IN THE HOSPITAL.

03:10.133 --> 03:11.633
>> WHO IS IN THE HOSPITAL, SIR?

03:11.633 --> 03:12.533
>> YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T HEAR ME,

03:12.533 --> 03:15.767
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, ONE OF OUR

03:15.767 --> 03:16.934
"YES" VOTES IS IN THE HOSPITAL.

03:16.934 --> 03:18.433
I CAN'T TAKE -- I CAN'T WAIT --

03:18.433 --> 03:19.133
I CAN'T TAKE HIM

03:19.133 --> 03:21.767
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

03:21.767 --> 03:22.934
>> John: NOW, TO BE FAIR TO THE

03:22.934 --> 03:24.467
PRESIDENT, HE COULDN'T TAKE THAT

03:24.467 --> 03:25.767
SENATOR OUT OF THE HOSPITAL,

03:25.767 --> 03:26.800
BECAUSE -- AND THIS WILL NOT

03:26.800 --> 03:28.467
SURPRISE YOU -- THERE WAS

03:28.467 --> 03:31.667
NO SENATOR IN THE HOSPITAL.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.467
PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MAY HAVE BEEN

03:33.467 --> 03:34.233
THINKING OF SENATOR

03:34.233 --> 03:35.467
THAD COCHRAN, WHO WAS OUT FOR

03:35.467 --> 03:36.867
MEDICAL REASONS, BUT WHO TWEETED

03:36.867 --> 03:38.033
"THANKS FOR THE WELL-WISHES.

03:38.033 --> 03:41.233
I'M NOT HOSPITALIZED."

03:41.233 --> 03:42.233
AND COCHRAN'S STAFF EVEN

03:42.233 --> 03:43.266
RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING

03:43.266 --> 03:44.266
HE WAS RECUPERATING FROM

03:44.266 --> 03:46.633
A "UROLOGICAL ISSUE."

03:46.633 --> 03:47.834
SO THE PRESIDENT'S LIES

03:47.834 --> 03:48.600
ESSENTIALLY BECAME SO

03:48.600 --> 03:50.200
FRUSTRATING, THE ONLY WAY TO

03:50.200 --> 03:51.834
SHUT THEM DOWN WAS TO PUBLICLY

03:51.834 --> 03:53.233
DISCUSS THE FACT SOMETHING

03:53.233 --> 03:54.600
MAYBE WRONG WITH THAD COCHRAN'S

03:54.600 --> 03:56.934
DICK.

03:56.934 --> 03:58.300
AND JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT

03:58.300 --> 03:59.633
HAPPENED THERE.

03:59.633 --> 04:01.100
THE PRESIDENT JUST REPEATEDLY

04:01.100 --> 04:02.900
SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT

04:02.900 --> 04:05.533
TRUE, THAT WAS WRONG.

04:05.533 --> 04:07.867
WE JUST CAUGHT HIM IN A LIE.

04:07.867 --> 04:08.633
IN OTHER WORDS --

04:08.633 --> 04:09.900
AND I HAVE WAITED A LONG TIME

04:09.900 --> 04:11.667
TO DO THIS --

04:11.667 --> 04:14.367
WE GOT HIM!

04:14.367 --> 04:17.633
WE GOT HIM!

04:17.700 --> 04:28.567
♪ ♪

04:29.400 --> 04:36.834
♪ ♪

04:36.834 --> 04:38.200
HE'S STILL PRESIDENT.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.667
HE'S STILL PRESIDENT.

04:39.667 --> 04:40.166
I JUST FOUND OUT

04:40.166 --> 04:43.233
HE'S STILL PRESIDENT.

04:43.233 --> 04:44.867
I'M SORRY!

04:44.867 --> 04:51.600
I THOUGHT THAT COCHRAN THING

04:51.600 --> 04:53.633
WOULD DO IT..

04:53.633 --> 05:01.033
I'M REALLY SORRY.

05:01.033 --> 05:02.767
I THOUGHT HE WAS FINISHED.

05:02.767 --> 05:03.033
I'M SORRY.

05:03.033 --> 05:05.667
I'M SORRY.

05:05.667 --> 05:06.367
THE SENATOR WASN'T IN

05:06.367 --> 05:08.967
THE HOSPITAL.

05:08.967 --> 05:10.900
I GUESS WE'VE GOT TO CARRY ON

05:10.900 --> 05:12.000
WITH THE SHOW, SO LET'S

05:12.000 --> 05:14.233
MOVE ON TO TAX REFORM.

05:14.233 --> 05:15.867
THE CONCEPT THAT GIVES

05:15.867 --> 05:17.266
GROVER NORQUIST

05:17.266 --> 05:19.333
A SHATTERING NOR-GASM.

05:19.333 --> 05:20.300
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN PROMISING

05:20.300 --> 05:22.667
TAX REFORM ALL YEAR, WHICH IS

05:22.667 --> 05:23.367
USUALLY TAKEN TO MEAN

05:23.367 --> 05:24.400
"A COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL

05:24.400 --> 05:25.600
OF THE TAX CODE."

05:25.600 --> 05:27.300
BUT IT SEEMS, IN TRUMP'S HANDS,

05:27.300 --> 05:29.767
TO HAVE BECOME MUCH NARROWER.

05:29.767 --> 05:30.934
>> AT THE VERY CENTER OF THAT

05:30.934 --> 05:36.166
PLAN IS A GIANT, BEAUTIFUL,

05:36.166 --> 05:38.233
MASSIVE, THE BIGGEST EVER

05:38.233 --> 05:46.166
IN OUR COUNTRY, TAX CUT.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.300
>> John: OKAY, TO BE CLEAR:

05:47.300 --> 05:47.900
A TAX CUT IS NOT JUST AT THE

05:47.900 --> 05:49.300
CENTER OF HIS PLAN.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.800
IT BASICALLY IS HIS PLAN.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.667
IT'S LIKE SAYING "AT THE CENTER

05:51.667 --> 05:57.533
OF THIS EGG IS AN EGG."

05:57.533 --> 05:58.633
WELL, YEAH, OF COURSE,

05:58.633 --> 05:59.800
IT'S AN EGG.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.734
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

06:00.734 --> 06:01.500
AND WHILE THE PLAN IS

06:01.500 --> 06:02.533
MADDENINGLY LIGHT ON DETAIL,

06:02.533 --> 06:03.400
WHEN THE NONPARTISAN

06:03.400 --> 06:04.934
TAX POLICY CENTER TRIED TO

06:04.934 --> 06:06.033
CREATE AN ESTIMATE FOR WHAT IT

06:06.033 --> 06:07.166
MIGHT DO, THEY FOUND THAT,

06:07.166 --> 06:09.700
BY 2027, IT COULD RAISE TAXES

06:09.700 --> 06:11.266
ON MANY MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES,

06:11.266 --> 06:12.367
AND THAT AROUND 80% OF

06:12.367 --> 06:13.667
THE BENEFITS WOULD GO TO

06:13.667 --> 06:15.834
TAXPAYERS IN THE TOP 1%.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.767
AND JUST THIS MORNING

06:18.767 --> 06:19.700
TRUMP'S TREASURY SECRETARY

06:19.700 --> 06:21.000
STEVEN MNUCHIN -- ALSO KNOWN AS

06:21.000 --> 06:22.200
ME, JOHN OLIVER, MOMENTS AFTER

06:22.200 --> 06:23.567
WAKING UP FROM A SURGERY TO HAVE

06:23.567 --> 06:27.200
MY MORALS REMOVED --

06:27.200 --> 06:29.467
HE DISMISSED THOSE CONCERNS.

06:29.467 --> 06:30.467
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW THE TAX

06:30.467 --> 06:34.900
POLICY CENTER CAN PUBLISH THOSE

06:34.900 --> 06:36.900
FIGURES SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE

06:36.900 --> 06:37.633
ALL THE DETAILS,

06:37.633 --> 06:38.333
INCLUDING THE BRACKETS.

06:38.333 --> 06:38.967
PEOPLE LIKE THE TAX FOUNDATION

06:38.967 --> 06:39.467
AND OTHERS HAVE WAITED,

06:39.467 --> 06:42.467
WHICH I THINK IS RESPONSIBLE.

06:42.467 --> 06:43.033
>> John: OKAY, SO FIRST.

06:43.033 --> 06:44.066
I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT.

06:44.066 --> 06:46.767
I THINK HE'S HANDSOME.

06:46.767 --> 06:48.467
YOU KNOW?

06:48.467 --> 06:50.467
NOT IN A CONVENTIONAL WAY.

06:50.467 --> 06:53.000
BUT, LIKE, HE REALLY

06:53.000 --> 06:53.800
IS STRIKING.

06:53.800 --> 06:54.867
BUT IT'S HARD TO HEAR MNUCHIN

06:54.867 --> 06:55.533
URGE PEOPLE TO WITHHOLD

06:55.533 --> 06:56.100
JUDGMENT, WHEN THIS

06:56.100 --> 06:56.667
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN OUT

06:56.667 --> 06:57.266
AGGRESSIVELY SELLING THE PLAN

06:57.266 --> 06:57.967
ALL WEEK.

06:57.967 --> 06:59.834
TAKE TRUMP'S CHIEF ECONOMIC

06:59.834 --> 07:01.967
ADVISOR, GARY COHN, THE ANSWER

07:01.967 --> 07:03.000
TO THE QUESTION "WHAT IF DADDY

07:03.000 --> 07:04.200
WARBUCKS NEVER MET ANNIE AND

07:04.200 --> 07:05.266
JUST KEPT BEING AN ASSHOLE FOR

07:05.266 --> 07:07.000
THE REST OF HIS LIFE?"

07:07.000 --> 07:08.967
HE SPOKE TO REPORTERS AND WAS

07:08.967 --> 07:10.300
HAPPY TO GAME OUT HOW A

07:10.300 --> 07:11.533
MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY COULD SPEND

07:11.533 --> 07:13.834
THEIR HYPOTHETICAL TAX CUT.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.767
>> IF WE ALLOW A FAMILY TO KEEP

07:15.767 --> 07:16.734
ANOTHER THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

07:16.734 --> 07:17.667
THEIR INCOME, WHAT DOES THAT

07:17.667 --> 07:18.734
MEAN?

07:18.734 --> 07:19.834
THEY CAN RENOVATE THEIR KITCHEN.

07:19.834 --> 07:22.800
THEY CAN BUY A NEW CAR.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.667
THEY CAN TAKE A FAMILY VACATION.

07:24.667 --> 07:25.300
THEY CAN INCREASE THEIR

07:25.300 --> 07:29.367
LIFESTYLE.

07:29.367 --> 07:30.433
>> John: HOLD ON.

07:30.433 --> 07:31.066
A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A KITCHEN

07:31.066 --> 07:32.066
RENOVATION?

07:32.066 --> 07:32.734
OR A NEW CAR?

07:32.734 --> 07:34.300
HE'S TALKING ABOUT $1,000 LIKE

07:34.300 --> 07:37.633
A CARTOON HOBO FROM THE 1920s.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.000
"OH, IF I EVER GOT THAT KINDA

07:39.000 --> 07:39.734
MONEY, YOWZA.

07:39.734 --> 07:40.533
I'D BUY MYSELF A PRIVATE ISLAND,

07:40.533 --> 07:41.533
I WOULD.

07:41.533 --> 07:42.700
I'D EAT CAVIAR THREE TIMES

07:42.700 --> 07:44.000
A DAY, AND MY BUTLER WOULD BE

07:44.000 --> 07:45.700
A TRAINED SEAL.

07:45.700 --> 07:46.967
MAN, WITH A THOUSAND SMACKAROOS,

07:46.967 --> 07:48.166
I'D NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

07:48.166 --> 07:53.233
NOTHIN' NEVER AGAIN."

07:53.233 --> 07:54.400
LOOK, AS FOR THE PRESIDENT

07:54.400 --> 07:55.333
HIMSELF, HE IS STILL INSISTING

07:55.333 --> 07:56.100
THAT WEALTHY AMERICANS,

07:56.100 --> 07:57.133
INCLUDING HIMSELF,

07:57.133 --> 07:59.800
WILL NOT BENEFIT.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.633
>> OUR FRAMEWORK INCLUDES OUR

08:01.633 --> 08:03.500
EXPLICIT COMMITMENT THAT TAX

08:03.500 --> 08:05.533
REFORM WILL PROTECT LOW-INCOME

08:05.533 --> 08:07.200
AND MIDDLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS,

08:07.200 --> 08:08.734
NOT THE WEALTHY AND WELL

08:08.734 --> 08:10.300
CONNECTED.

08:10.300 --> 08:11.934
THEY CAN CALL ME ALL THEY WANT.

08:11.934 --> 08:13.433
IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP.

08:13.433 --> 08:14.900
I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.200
AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME,

08:16.200 --> 08:17.667
BELIEVE ME.

08:17.667 --> 08:20.934
>> John: I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.300
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.300
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

08:23.300 --> 08:24.200
JUST ONE ELEMENT OF THE PLAN --

08:24.200 --> 08:24.967
THE ELIMINATION OF THE ESTATE

08:24.967 --> 08:26.567
TAX -- COULD, BY ONE ESTIMATE

08:26.567 --> 08:27.900
SAVE TRUMP'S FAMILY AS MUCH

08:27.900 --> 08:29.500
AS A BILLION DOLLARS.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.734
SO, AGAIN, HE'S WRONG.

08:31.734 --> 08:32.433
WE JUST CAUGHT HIM

08:32.433 --> 08:33.200
IN ANOTHER LIE.

08:33.200 --> 08:37.000
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:37.000 --> 08:37.600
THIS TIME I'M DEFINITELY GOING

08:37.600 --> 08:38.200
TO CALL IT.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.100
WE GOT HIM!

08:39.100 --> 08:42.700
WE GOT HIM!

08:42.700 --> 08:44.133
WE --

08:44.133 --> 08:44.500
THAT'S FAIR.

08:44.500 --> 08:50.100
AND NOW THIS.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.500
>> Announcer: AND NOW GUY

08:52.500 --> 08:53.467
FIERI GIVES A SURPRISINGLY

08:53.467 --> 08:55.066
DETAILED TOUR OF HIS FAVORITE

08:55.066 --> 08:56.433
PLACE ON EARTH.

08:56.433 --> 08:57.700
>> I'M GUY FIERI.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.333
YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED?

08:59.333 --> 09:00.467
I NEED YOU RIDING SHOTGUN.

09:00.467 --> 09:03.000
I AM ON MY WAY TO FLAVOR TOWN.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.934
THIS IS LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN TO

09:06.934 --> 09:08.333
FLAVOR TOWN.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.500
RAVIOLI TRAIN.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.367
FLAVOR TOWN PASSPORT.

09:10.367 --> 09:13.300
$10 TICKET TO FLAVOR TOWN.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.433
I AM MINDING FOR FOOD IN

09:14.433 --> 09:17.133
FLAVOR TOWN RIVER.

09:17.133 --> 09:20.100
THE SHIPYARD OF FLAVOR TOWN.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.934
THAT LOOKS LIKE A MANHOLE COVER

09:22.934 --> 09:23.967
IN FLAVOR TOWN.

09:23.967 --> 09:26.033
THE COMMUNITY POOL OF

09:26.033 --> 09:27.867
FLAVOR TOWN.

09:27.867 --> 09:28.900
SHE THREW AWAY THE DENTAL FLOSS

09:28.900 --> 09:31.166
AT FLAVOR TOWN.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.800
THIS MAY BE MAKING A BRICK AT

09:32.800 --> 09:34.133
THE CAPITAL OF FLAVOR TOWN.

09:34.133 --> 09:36.500
IT'S LIKE THE ARTILLERY CENTER

09:36.500 --> 09:37.500
IN FLAVOR TOWN.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.967
THE FIRST DISCOVERED CULINARY

09:38.967 --> 09:41.266
CAVE OF FLAVOR TOWN.

09:41.266 --> 09:50.066
THAT'S THE NATURAL GROUND.

09:50.066 --> 09:50.700
>> John: MOVING ON.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.200
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

09:52.200 --> 09:53.300
CRIME, YOU KNOW, THAT THING

09:53.300 --> 09:54.433
THAT WAS ALMOST SOLVED BY

09:54.433 --> 09:56.700
A FLASHER DOG IN THE 1980s.

09:56.700 --> 09:57.967
SPECIFICALLY, THIS STORY IS

09:57.967 --> 09:59.133
ABOUT HOW WE INCREASINGLY SOLVE

09:59.133 --> 10:03.700
CRIMES USING FORENSIC EVIDENCE.

10:03.700 --> 10:04.700
THAT THING THAT'S

10:04.700 --> 10:09.166
A STAPLE OF TV CRIME SHOWS.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.700
>> BULLETIN FROM THE TORSO ON

10:10.700 --> 10:12.133
THE LEFT.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.400
BULLETS FROM THE BOAT ON THE

10:14.400 --> 10:15.367
RIGHT.

10:15.367 --> 10:19.734
>> TWO HEARTS BEAT AS ONE.

10:19.734 --> 10:25.000
>> THAT'S ADVANTAGE.

10:25.000 --> 10:25.667
>> I THINK I JUST FOUND US

10:25.667 --> 10:27.233
A MATCH.

10:27.233 --> 10:28.800
>> WE HAVE A MATCH.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.500
>> WERE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE

10:29.500 --> 10:30.934
WHICH MONKEY BIT HIM?

10:30.934 --> 10:32.033
>> THE BITE MARKS MATCHED THOSE

10:32.033 --> 10:32.700
OF THE MONKEY FOUND AT THE

10:32.700 --> 10:33.533
SCENE.

10:33.533 --> 10:34.300
>> John: OH!

10:34.300 --> 10:34.867
THAT LAST ONE WAS PRESUMABLY

10:34.867 --> 10:35.767
FROM ONE OF THE CROSSOVER

10:35.767 --> 10:36.266
EPISODES, WHERE THE TEAM

10:36.266 --> 10:36.900
FROM "LAW & ORDER" WORKED A CASE

10:36.900 --> 10:37.433
WITH THE CAST OF

10:37.433 --> 10:42.300
"MONKEY LAW & MONKEY ORDER."

10:42.300 --> 10:44.066
BUT ON TV AND IN REAL LIFE,

10:44.066 --> 10:45.266
FORENSIC SCIENCE PLAYS AN

10:45.266 --> 10:45.867
IMPORTANT ROLE IN CRIMINAL

10:45.867 --> 10:47.266
CONVICTIONS.

10:47.266 --> 10:48.500
PROSECUTORS OFTEN COMPLAIN ABOUT

10:48.500 --> 10:50.667
A SO-CALLED "CSI EFFECT,"

10:50.667 --> 10:52.033
WHERE JURORS EXPECT TO SEE

10:52.033 --> 10:53.834
FORENSIC EVIDENCE IN EVERY CASE.

10:53.834 --> 10:55.166
THE PROBLEM IS, NOT ALL FORENSIC

10:55.166 --> 10:57.066
SCIENCE IS AS RELIABLE AS WE'VE

10:57.066 --> 10:58.800
BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO BELIEVE.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.200
A REPORT IN 2009 BY THE NATIONAL

11:00.200 --> 11:02.066
ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOUND THAT

11:02.066 --> 11:03.667
MANY FORENSIC SCIENCES

11:03.667 --> 11:04.900
"DO NOT MEET THE FUNDAMENTAL

11:04.900 --> 11:06.633
REQUIREMENTS OF SCIENCE."

11:06.633 --> 11:07.667
AND A REPORT LAST YEAR

11:07.667 --> 11:08.367
BY A PRESIDENTIAL SCIENCE

11:08.367 --> 11:09.700
COUNCIL AGREED, SAYING THAT

11:09.700 --> 11:11.633
"EXPERT WITNESSES IN COURT HAVE

11:11.633 --> 11:12.667
OFTEN OVERSTATED THE VALUE OF

11:12.667 --> 11:14.133
THEIR EVIDENCE, GOING FAR BEYOND

11:14.133 --> 11:15.767
WHAT THE RELEVANT SCIENCE CAN

11:15.767 --> 11:17.200
JUSTIFY."

11:17.200 --> 11:18.800
AND THAT'S THE THING.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.400
IT'S NOT THAT ALL FORENSIC

11:19.400 --> 11:23.200
SCIENCE IS BAD.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.033
'CAUSE IT'S NOT.

11:24.033 --> 11:24.700
BUT TOO OFTEN, ITS RELIABILITY

11:24.700 --> 11:25.967
IS DANGEROUSLY OVERSTATED.

11:25.967 --> 11:27.000
AND ONE SIGN OF THAT IS THAT

11:27.000 --> 11:27.934
FORENSIC EXPERTS IN COURT ARE

11:27.934 --> 11:29.467
OFTEN NUDGED TO USE ONE VERY

11:29.467 --> 11:31.433
CONVINCING PHRASE.

11:31.433 --> 11:31.967
>> TO A REASONABLE DEGREE

11:31.967 --> 11:34.133
OF SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY.

11:34.133 --> 11:34.767
>> TO A REASONABLE DEGREE

11:34.767 --> 11:36.467
OF SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY.

11:36.467 --> 11:37.000
>> TO A REASONABLE DEGREE

11:37.000 --> 11:40.433
OF SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.600
>> WITHIN A REASONABLE DEGREE

11:41.600 --> 11:43.066
OF SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY.

11:43.066 --> 11:43.600
>> A REASONABLE DEGREE

11:43.600 --> 11:44.300
OF SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.133
>> ARE YOU ABLE TO SAY THAT

11:45.133 --> 11:46.200
WITHIN A REASONABLE DEGREE

11:46.200 --> 11:47.700
OF SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY?

11:47.700 --> 11:49.500
>> YES.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.667
>> John: AND THAT PHRASE DOES

11:50.667 --> 11:51.900
HAVE A PERSUASIVE RING TO IT.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.066
UNFORTUNATELY, AS THAT

11:53.066 --> 11:54.033
PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL POINTED

11:54.033 --> 11:55.567
OUT, IT "HAS NO GENERALLY

11:55.567 --> 11:57.934
ACCEPTED MEANING IN SCIENCE."

11:57.934 --> 11:58.834
IT'S ONE OF THOSE TERMS LIKE

11:58.834 --> 12:01.166
"BASIC" OR "TRILL" THAT HAS NO

12:01.166 --> 12:03.767
COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD DEFINITION.

12:03.767 --> 12:04.934
AM I TRILL?

12:04.934 --> 12:08.033
IS THAT GOOD OR BAD?

12:08.033 --> 12:08.800
I MEAN, I DO FEEL TRILL,

12:08.800 --> 12:11.233
SO I'M GUESSING IT'S AWFUL.

12:11.233 --> 12:12.600
AND WHEN BAD SCIENCE IS

12:12.600 --> 12:14.633
CONFIDENTLY PRESENTED, TERRIBLE

12:14.633 --> 12:15.934
CONVICTIONS CAN HAPPEN.

12:15.934 --> 12:17.200
IN FACT, AMONG THE HUNDREDS OF

12:17.200 --> 12:18.133
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN EXONERATED BY

12:18.133 --> 12:20.266
DNA TESTING SINCE 1989,

12:20.266 --> 12:22.066
IN NEARLY HALF OF THEIR CASES,

12:22.066 --> 12:23.066
THERE WAS SOME MISAPPLICATION

12:23.066 --> 12:24.734
OF FORENSIC SCIENCE.

12:24.734 --> 12:25.633
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE BEHIND

12:25.633 --> 12:27.200
THOSE NUMBERS.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.333
TAKE SANTAE TRIBBLE, WHO WAS

12:28.333 --> 12:29.967
CONVICTED OF MURDER AND SERVED

12:29.967 --> 12:31.900
26 YEARS, IN LARGE PART, THANKS

12:31.900 --> 12:33.367
TO AN FBI ANALYST WHO TESTIFIED

12:33.367 --> 12:35.133
HIS HAIR MATCHED HAIRS FOUND

12:35.133 --> 12:37.300
AT THE SCENE.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.934
AS HE'LL TELL YOU, THE EVIDENCE

12:38.934 --> 12:41.533
WAS PRESENTED AS ROCK-SOLID.

12:41.533 --> 12:42.934
>> THEY SAID THEY MATCH MY HAIR

12:42.934 --> 12:44.166
IN ALL MICROSCOPICAL

12:44.166 --> 12:46.166
CHARACTERISTICS.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.400
AND THAT'S THE WAY THEY

12:47.400 --> 12:48.800
PRESENTED IT TO THE JURY AND THE

12:48.800 --> 12:50.967
JURY TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT

12:50.967 --> 12:56.967
THAT WAS MY HAIR.

12:56.967 --> 12:59.300
>> John: I CAN SEE WAY THEY

12:59.300 --> 13:00.266
DID.

13:00.266 --> 13:01.000
WHO OTHER THAN AN FBI

13:01.000 --> 13:01.633
EXPERT WOULD POSSIBLY KNOW THAT

13:01.633 --> 13:02.333
MUCH ABOUT HAIR?

13:02.333 --> 13:03.300
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, FOR WHOEVER

13:03.300 --> 13:04.133
STYLED AMANDA SEYFRIED

13:04.133 --> 13:05.200
AT THE 2009 OSCARS.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.667
BREATHTAKING WAVES, WITHOUT

13:06.667 --> 13:07.266
LOSING ANY OF THEIR BODY

13:07.266 --> 13:08.567
OR BOUNCE.

13:08.567 --> 13:11.000
STUNNING.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.600
STUNNING.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.333
STUNNING.

13:15.333 --> 13:16.300
STUNNING.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.200
STUNNING.

13:17.200 --> 13:17.700
STUNNING.

13:17.700 --> 13:18.333
STUNNING.

13:18.333 --> 13:18.734
STUNNING.

13:18.734 --> 13:19.133
STUNNING.

13:19.133 --> 13:19.567
STUNNING.

13:19.567 --> 13:20.834
STUNNING.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.567
JURORS IN TRIBBLE'S CASE WERE

13:22.567 --> 13:23.667
ACTUALLY TOLD THAT THERE

13:23.667 --> 13:25.033
WAS ONE CHANCE IN TEN MILLION

13:25.033 --> 13:25.667
THAT IT COULD BE SOMEONE ELSE'S

13:25.667 --> 13:26.433
HAIR.

13:26.433 --> 13:27.367
AND GUESS WHAT?

13:27.367 --> 13:28.667
HE WAS EXONERATED.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.066
BECAUSE ONCE DNA ANALYSIS BECAME

13:30.066 --> 13:31.600
AVAILABLE, HIS LAWYER TESTED

13:31.600 --> 13:33.533
THE 13 HAIRS FROM THE CASE,

13:33.533 --> 13:34.800
AND NOT ONLY WERE NONE OF THEM

13:34.800 --> 13:36.667
HIS, SOME OF WHAT THEY FOUND

13:36.667 --> 13:38.200
WAS INCREDIBLE.

13:38.200 --> 13:38.900
>> NINE OF THE HAIRS HAD COME

13:38.900 --> 13:40.467
FROM THE SAME SOURCE, A COUPLE

13:40.467 --> 13:42.667
HAD COME FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES,

13:42.667 --> 13:49.300
AND ONE WAS A DOG.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.734
>> TWO DIFFERENT AGENTS DIDN'T

13:51.734 --> 13:53.200
RECOGNIZE IT WAS DOG HAIR?

13:53.200 --> 13:56.633
>> IT WAS A CANINE, A DOMESTIC

13:56.633 --> 13:57.667
DOG.

13:57.667 --> 13:58.734
>> MY PERSONAL CONCLUSION WAS,

13:58.734 --> 14:03.033
THE DOG COMMITTED THE CRIME.

14:03.033 --> 14:04.367
>> John: OKAY, FIRST:

14:04.367 --> 14:05.166
IT'S AMAZING

14:05.166 --> 14:06.333
THAT HE'S ABLE TO LAUGH AT THAT.

14:06.333 --> 14:06.967
BUT SECOND, IF A DOG DID COMMIT

14:06.967 --> 14:08.066
THE CRIME, THERE'S REALLY NO

14:08.066 --> 14:08.700
RECOURSE, BECAUSE THERE'S

14:08.700 --> 14:09.867
ACTUALLY NO LAW AGAINST DOGS

14:09.867 --> 14:11.900
COMMITTING MURDER, A FACT

14:11.900 --> 14:12.767
I LEARNED IN

14:12.767 --> 14:14.166
"AIR BUD NINE:

14:14.166 --> 14:17.000
FUCK THE PAW-LICE."

14:17.000 --> 14:18.767
AND IT TURNS OUT, TRIBBLE

14:18.767 --> 14:20.100
IS NOT THE ONLY CASE WHERE FBI

14:20.100 --> 14:21.100
EXPERTS OVERSTATED THEIR

14:21.100 --> 14:23.467
CONFIDENCE IN THEIR RESULTS.

14:23.467 --> 14:24.767
>> THE INNOCENCE PROJECT AND THE

14:24.767 --> 14:25.967
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL

14:25.967 --> 14:27.734
DEFENSE LAWYERS FOUND FROM THE

14:27.734 --> 14:32.400
1970s THROUGH 1999, IN 268 CASES

14:32.400 --> 14:34.367
WHERE FBI HAIR ANALYSIS LEAD TO

14:34.367 --> 14:39.300
A CONVICTION, 257 OR 96% OF THEM

14:39.300 --> 14:42.033
HAD ERRORS IN ANALYSIS.

14:42.033 --> 14:42.934
>> John: OH, IT GETS WORSE,

14:42.934 --> 14:44.667
BECAUSE NINE OF THOSE DEFENDANTS

14:44.667 --> 14:47.367
HAD ALREADY BEEN EXECUTED.

14:47.367 --> 14:48.834
WHICH IS HORRIFYING.

14:48.834 --> 14:49.800
AND YOU'D EXPECT

14:49.800 --> 14:52.400
FBI HAIR ANALYSIS TO HAVE

14:52.400 --> 14:54.000
A HIGHER RATE OF ACCURACY THAN

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
YOUR FRIENDS' HAIR ANALYSIS OF,

14:56.000 --> 14:56.867
"YOU CAN TOTALLY PULL OFF

14:56.867 --> 14:57.934
BANGS."

14:57.934 --> 15:02.667
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.

15:02.667 --> 15:05.633
YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN'T.

15:05.633 --> 15:06.533
BELIEVE ME.

15:06.533 --> 15:06.867
I COULDN'T.

15:06.867 --> 15:07.600
LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES, KIDS.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.266
SAVE YOURSELVES.

15:10.266 --> 15:13.300
IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME.

15:13.300 --> 15:13.900
IT IS BY NO MEANS JUST

15:13.900 --> 15:14.467
MICROSCOPIC HAIR COMPARISON

15:14.467 --> 15:15.133
WHICH HAS HAD THE RELIABILITY OF

15:15.133 --> 15:15.967
ITS RESULTS OVERSTATED.

15:15.967 --> 15:17.200
THOSE REPORTS I SHOWED EARLIER

15:17.200 --> 15:18.667
SUGGEST THERE'S WEAK SCIENTIFIC

15:18.667 --> 15:19.633
SUPPORT FOR SOME ASPECTS OF

15:19.633 --> 15:22.333
TECHNIQUES LIKE BLOOD PATTERN,

15:22.333 --> 15:23.033
FOOTWEAR, FIREARM,

15:23.033 --> 15:25.433
AND BITE MARK ANALYSIS.

15:25.433 --> 15:26.433
AND YOU MUST BE FAMILIAR WITH

15:26.433 --> 15:27.533
THAT LAST ONE, FROM COOL SCENES

15:27.533 --> 15:29.567
LIKE THIS.

15:29.567 --> 15:32.133
>> A LITTLE 3D MAGIC FOR CLARITY

15:32.133 --> 15:33.867
AND I GIVE YOU THE KILLER'S

15:33.867 --> 15:42.500
INCISORS.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.066
[BEEPING]

15:44.066 --> 15:44.900
>> John: OH, NO!

15:44.900 --> 15:45.467
THE COMPUTER RATED IT YELLOW

15:45.467 --> 15:46.200
RECTANGLE!

15:46.200 --> 15:47.367
AS WE ALL KNOW, YELLOW RECTANGLE

15:47.367 --> 15:48.500
IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF MATCH

15:48.500 --> 15:49.433
A COMPUTER CAN GIVE YOU ABOUT

15:49.433 --> 15:51.567
TEETH!

15:51.567 --> 15:52.667
IN THE REAL WORLD, BITE MARK

15:52.667 --> 15:54.367
ANALYSIS IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE,

15:54.367 --> 15:55.300
AND UNRELIABLE.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.033
THE PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL FOUND

15:56.033 --> 15:57.400
THE ENTIRE DISCIPLINE

15:57.400 --> 15:58.567
"DOES NOT MEET THE SCIENTIFIC

15:58.567 --> 16:00.300
STANDARDS FOR FOUNDATIONAL

16:00.300 --> 16:03.333
VALIDITY," WHICH I BELIEVE IS

16:03.333 --> 16:05.800
SCIENCE-SPEAK FOR "BULLSHIT."

16:05.800 --> 16:07.133
BUT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SENT TO

16:07.133 --> 16:07.867
PRISON ON THE BASIS OF BITE-MARK

16:07.867 --> 16:09.333
TESTIMONY BY EXPERTS LIKE

16:09.333 --> 16:11.667
DR. MICHAEL WEST.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.166
>> THE SCIENCE OF BITE MARKS

16:13.166 --> 16:14.967
ANALYSIS IS VERY ACCURATE.

16:14.967 --> 16:15.967
>> WHEN IT COMES TO BITE MARKS,

16:15.967 --> 16:17.400
WEST CONSIDERS HIMSELF

16:17.400 --> 16:18.567
THE MAESTRO.

16:18.567 --> 16:19.867
HE'S FOUND BITE MARKS

16:19.867 --> 16:21.266
ON A DECOMPOSED BODY SUBMERGED

16:21.266 --> 16:23.567
IN A SWAMP, ON A CORPSE THAT HAD

16:23.567 --> 16:24.633
BEEN BURIED FOR MORE THAN

16:24.633 --> 16:25.867
A YEAR.

16:25.867 --> 16:27.333
HE'S EVEN USED A BITE MARK TAKEN

16:27.333 --> 16:28.667
OUT OF A BOLOGNA SANDWICH

16:28.667 --> 16:30.900
TO GET A CONVICTION.

16:30.900 --> 16:31.934
>> John: THAT SOUNDS IMPRESSIVE.

16:31.934 --> 16:33.433
MATCHING A KILLER'S TEETH TO A

16:33.433 --> 16:35.200
BITE MARK IN A BOLOGNA SANDWICH.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.066
ALTHOUGH YOU SHOULD KNOW THE

16:36.066 --> 16:36.967
DEFENDANT IN THAT CASE

16:36.967 --> 16:38.033
GOT A NEW TRIAL, AFTER

16:38.033 --> 16:39.066
AN AUTOPSY REPORT FOUND THAT

16:39.066 --> 16:40.900
THE MURDER VICTIM HAD ACTUALLY

16:40.900 --> 16:42.834
EATEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF BOLOGNA,

16:42.834 --> 16:43.700
CONSISTENT WITH THE AMOUNT

16:43.700 --> 16:45.800
BITTEN OFF THE SANDWICH.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.166
SO THAT SANDWICH WAS IRRELEVANT

16:47.166 --> 16:48.333
TO THE CASE.

16:48.333 --> 16:49.333
IN FACT, YOU COULD EVEN ARGUE

16:49.333 --> 16:50.500
THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY

16:50.500 --> 16:52.800
DR. WEST WHO WAS FULL OF --

16:52.800 --> 16:54.600
SAY IT WITH ME --

16:54.600 --> 16:56.333
SHIT.

16:56.333 --> 16:58.000
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ISSUE

16:58.000 --> 16:58.567
THAT'S ARISEN FROM HIS

16:58.567 --> 16:59.333
TESTIMONY.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.734
THERE ARE NOW FIVE CASES

17:00.734 --> 17:01.867
WHERE HE TESTIFIED FOR THE

17:01.867 --> 17:02.734
PROSECUTION AND WHERE THE

17:02.734 --> 17:03.433
CHARGES WERE DROPPED

17:03.433 --> 17:04.533
OR THE CONVICTION

17:04.533 --> 17:05.700
WAS LATER OVERTURNED.

17:05.700 --> 17:06.834
AND EVEN WEST HIMSELF

17:06.834 --> 17:07.800
HAS ADMITTED THAT,

17:07.800 --> 17:09.100
HE NO LONGER BELIEVES

17:09.100 --> 17:11.033
IN BITE MARK ANALYSIS FOR

17:11.033 --> 17:12.767
IDENTIFYING PERPETRATORS, AND HE

17:12.767 --> 17:13.433
DOESN'T THINK IT SHOULD BE USED

17:13.433 --> 17:14.867
IN COURT.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.166
AND YET, INCREDIBLY,

17:16.166 --> 17:17.266
EVERY TIME A DEFENDANT HAS

17:17.266 --> 17:18.834
CHALLENGED ITS VALIDITY,

17:18.834 --> 17:19.433
THE COURT HAS RULED IT

17:19.433 --> 17:21.066
ADMISSIBLE.

17:21.066 --> 17:22.834
AND A KEY REASON FOR THAT IS

17:22.834 --> 17:24.333
THAT JUDGES OFTEN RELY ON

17:24.333 --> 17:25.467
PRECEDENT TO DECIDE WHAT TO

17:25.467 --> 17:26.734
ALLOW IN FRONT OF A JURY.

17:26.734 --> 17:27.967
SO IF A PARTICULAR DISCIPLINE

17:27.967 --> 17:29.867
HAS BEEN IN COURT BEFORE,

17:29.867 --> 17:31.033
IT'S LIKELY A JUDGE WILL ADMIT

17:31.033 --> 17:32.600
IT AGAIN.

17:32.600 --> 17:33.800
ALL WHICH MEANS THAT, AS THE

17:33.800 --> 17:34.834
CO-FOUNDER OF THE INNOCENCE

17:34.834 --> 17:36.633
PROJECT POINTS OUT, DECISIONS

17:36.633 --> 17:38.467
ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF SCIENCE

17:38.467 --> 17:39.300
ARE BEING MADE BY PEOPLE WHO

17:39.300 --> 17:40.500
DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW MUCH

17:40.500 --> 17:42.700
ABOUT IT.

17:42.700 --> 17:43.633
>> HISTORICALLY, WE HAD

17:43.633 --> 17:46.200
A SITUATION WHERE TWO

17:46.200 --> 17:47.433
SCIENTIFICALLY ILLITERATE

17:47.433 --> 17:49.567
LAWYERS ARGUE THE BONA FIDES

17:49.567 --> 17:51.467
OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR A

17:51.467 --> 17:53.467
SCIENTIFICALLY ILLITERATE JUDGE

17:53.467 --> 17:54.800
SO THAT 12 SCIENTIFICALLY

17:54.800 --> 17:57.000
ILLITERATE JURORS COULD DECIDE

17:57.000 --> 18:02.867
THE WEIGHT OF THAT EVIDENCE.

18:02.867 --> 18:03.934
>> John: IF YOU THINK ABOUT

18:03.934 --> 18:06.900
IT, IT'S TERRIFYING.

18:06.900 --> 18:07.633
TRIALS CAN OFTEN BE A SITUATION

18:07.633 --> 18:08.166
WHERE NO ONE REALLY KNOWS

18:08.166 --> 18:08.867
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

18:08.867 --> 18:09.500
IT'S LIKE A COOKING COMPETITION

18:09.500 --> 18:10.000
FOR TODDLERS, HOSTED BY

18:10.000 --> 18:10.633
A STRAY CAT AND JUDGED

18:10.633 --> 18:12.700
BY GOATS.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.033
"THE TUNA WAS UNDERCOOKED AND

18:14.033 --> 18:15.667
COVERED IN COLD SPAGHETTI SAUCE.

18:15.667 --> 18:16.700
YOU THEN, FOR SOME REASON,

18:16.700 --> 18:17.467
COVERED THE WHOLE DISH

18:17.467 --> 18:19.400
IN HONEY NUT CHEERIOS.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.367
I LOVED IT."

18:22.367 --> 18:23.934
NONE OF WHICH IS NOT TO SAY

18:23.934 --> 18:25.200
THERE ISN'T MORE RELIABLE

18:25.200 --> 18:26.333
FORENSIC SCIENCE OUT THERE.

18:26.333 --> 18:27.300
FINGERPRINTS AND DNA ARE

18:27.300 --> 18:29.433
OBVIOUS EXAMPLES.

18:29.433 --> 18:30.800
BUT WHILE WE THINK OF THEM AS

18:30.800 --> 18:37.100
PERFECT, IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW,

18:37.100 --> 18:40.100
THEY ARE BY NO MEANS INFALLIBLE.

18:40.100 --> 18:40.967
THE FBI HAS FOUND FINGERPRINT

18:40.967 --> 18:41.400
ANALYSIS COULD HAVE

18:41.400 --> 18:42.300
A FALSE-POSITIVE RATE AS HIGH

18:42.300 --> 18:42.800
AS 1 ERROR IN 306 CASES.

18:42.800 --> 18:47.100
AND A DRAMATIC EXAMPLE

18:47.100 --> 18:48.834
CAME AFTER THE MADRID

18:48.834 --> 18:51.667
TRAIN BOMBINGS IN 2004, WHEN THE

18:51.667 --> 18:52.600
FBI ARRESTED THIS OREGON MAN,

18:52.600 --> 18:53.233
BRANDON MAYFIELD.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.433
HE'D NEVER EVEN BEEN TO SPAIN,

18:54.433 --> 18:55.333
BUT THREE SEPARATE EXAMINERS

18:55.333 --> 18:57.033
MATCHED HIS FINGERPRINTS TO ONE

18:57.033 --> 19:00.967
ON A BAG OF DETONATORS.

19:00.967 --> 19:03.166
SO HE WAS AT THAT POINT

19:03.166 --> 19:04.100
COMPLETELY FUCKED.

19:04.100 --> 19:04.767
UNTIL INVESTIGATORS DETERMINED

19:04.767 --> 19:05.700
THAT THAT FINGERPRINT ACTUALLY

19:05.700 --> 19:07.000
ALSO MATCHED SOMEONE ELSE,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.734
WHO WAS IN SPAIN AT THE TIME.

19:09.734 --> 19:10.367
THAT BLEW THE MINDS OF

19:10.367 --> 19:11.800
FINGERPRINT EXPERTS.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.133
>> WE ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT

19:13.133 --> 19:13.700
FINGERPRINTS ARE VERY,

19:13.700 --> 19:16.000
VERY UNIQUE.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.767
BUT WHAT THE MAYFIELD CASE

19:17.767 --> 19:19.400
DEMONSTRATES IS THAT PARTS

19:19.400 --> 19:21.934
OF THE FINGERPRINT CAN BE

19:21.934 --> 19:23.967
SO SIMILAR IT'S POSSIBLE FOR TWO

19:23.967 --> 19:25.934
DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO BE

19:25.934 --> 19:28.500
IDENTIFIED TO BE ONE LATENT

19:28.500 --> 19:29.567
PRINT.

19:29.567 --> 19:30.333
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.066
IT TURNS OUT, TWO PEOPLE CAN

19:31.066 --> 19:32.367
HAVE FINGERPRINTS THAT ARE SO

19:32.367 --> 19:33.166
CLOSE THAT EVEN EXPERTS CAN'T

19:33.166 --> 19:34.300
TELL THEM APART.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.266
MEANING WE ARE THIS CLOSE

19:36.266 --> 19:37.967
TO FINALLY PROVING MY THEORY

19:37.967 --> 19:39.333
THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE

19:39.333 --> 19:41.000
OLSEN TWIN.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.667
SHE'S JUST MOVING VERY FAST BACK

19:42.667 --> 19:47.166
AND FORTH.

19:47.166 --> 19:50.200
SHE CONFUSES YOUR EYE.

19:50.200 --> 19:50.800
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS NEW

19:50.800 --> 19:51.433
INFORMATION HELPS YET, BUT WHEN

19:51.433 --> 19:52.033
IT DOES, THE END IS NIGH,

19:52.033 --> 19:53.200
YOU FRAUD!

19:53.200 --> 19:56.734
YOU FRAUD!

19:56.734 --> 19:57.900
AND THEN THERE'S DNA, WHICH IS

19:57.900 --> 19:59.000
THE GOLD STANDARD IN FORENSIC

19:59.000 --> 20:00.200
SCIENCE FOR A REASON.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.667
IN PERFECT CONDITIONS,

20:01.667 --> 20:02.533
IT'S SEEN AS THE MOST RELIABLE

20:02.533 --> 20:03.967
FORM OF EVIDENCE.

20:03.967 --> 20:06.567
BUT NOT ALL DNA TESTS ARE EQUAL,

20:06.567 --> 20:07.567
AND CRIME SCENES CAN PRODUCE

20:07.567 --> 20:10.700
DNA OF WIDELY VARYING QUALITY.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.467
>> DNA IS VERY FRAGILE

20:12.467 --> 20:13.467
AND EASILY MIXED UP

20:13.467 --> 20:15.166
AT A MESSY SCENE.

20:15.166 --> 20:15.800
>> SO YOU IMAGINE YOU COME

20:15.800 --> 20:17.467
ACROSS A CRIME SCENE, YOU MAY

20:17.467 --> 20:19.000
HAVE A POOL OF BLOOD AND IT MAY

20:19.000 --> 20:19.700
NOT BE ONE PERSON'S BLOOD,

20:19.700 --> 20:20.600
RIGHT?

20:20.600 --> 20:21.467
THE MORE CONTRIBUTORS TO THAT

20:21.467 --> 20:23.700
MIXTURE OF DNA, THE MORE

20:23.700 --> 20:25.633
DIFFICULT IT IS TO DETERMINE

20:25.633 --> 20:26.533
WHOSE DNA IT WAS, WHOSE BLOOD

20:26.533 --> 20:27.800
IT WAS.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.200
>> John: YEAH, IT CAN BE

20:29.200 --> 20:31.266
DIFFICULT TO TELL WHOSE BLOOD IS

20:31.266 --> 20:32.633
WHOSE IN A LARGE POOL OF BLOOD,

20:32.633 --> 20:33.867
WHICH IS, COINCIDENTALLY,

20:33.867 --> 20:35.233
THE PREMISE OF MY NEW GAME SHOW.

20:35.233 --> 20:36.834
"SO YOU THINK YOU CAN TELL WHOSE

20:36.834 --> 20:37.500
BLOOD IS WHOSE IN A LARGE POOL

20:37.500 --> 20:38.800
OF BLOOD?"

20:38.800 --> 20:39.867
IT PREMIERES ON TUESDAY NIGHT,

20:39.867 --> 20:40.934
AND APPARENTLY, IT'S ALREADY

20:40.934 --> 20:43.700
BEEN CANCELED.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.467
THE PROBLEM IS, LOWER-QUALITY

20:45.467 --> 20:47.133
DNA SAMPLES ARE SOMETIMES

20:47.133 --> 20:48.533
PRESENTED TO JURIES AS IF

20:48.533 --> 20:50.433
THEY'RE HIGHLY RELIABLE.

20:50.433 --> 20:52.100
IN 2003, A PROSECUTOR IN A

20:52.100 --> 20:53.667
DOUBLE MURDER TOLD THE JURY

20:53.667 --> 20:55.600
THE ODDS THE DEFENDANT'S DNA

20:55.600 --> 20:56.367
MATCHED A GLOVE FOUND

20:56.367 --> 20:58.300
AT THE SCENE BY CHANCE

20:58.300 --> 21:02.166
WAS 1 IN 1.1 BILLION.

21:02.166 --> 21:03.000
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.233
BUT IT TURNED OUT, THE GLOVE

21:04.233 --> 21:05.467
ACTUALLY CONTAINED AT LEAST

21:05.467 --> 21:07.233
THREE PEOPLE'S DNA, AND A LATER

21:07.233 --> 21:09.734
ANALYSIS PUT THE ODDS CLOSER

21:09.734 --> 21:11.033
TO ONE IN TWO.

21:11.033 --> 21:11.800
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:11.800 --> 21:13.767
THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

21:13.767 --> 21:15.266
PEOPLE CONFUSE THE NUMBERS

21:15.266 --> 21:17.166
1.1 BILLION AND TWO

21:17.166 --> 21:19.066
ALL THE TIME.

21:19.066 --> 21:20.600
I'M ALWAYS MISTAKENLY SAYING

21:20.600 --> 21:21.633
THAT MY FAVORITE R&B GROUP IS

21:21.633 --> 21:24.633
BOYZ 1.1 BILLION MEN.

21:24.633 --> 21:26.567
AND ON TOP OF ALL THIS, THERE'S

21:26.567 --> 21:27.367
ONE MORE FACTOR THAT CAN BE

21:27.367 --> 21:28.800
IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT, AND IT

21:28.800 --> 21:31.800
CONCERNS THE RELATIONSHIP

21:31.800 --> 21:32.767
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

21:32.767 --> 21:33.667
FORENSIC LABS THEMSELVES.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.367
BECAUSE YOU'D HOPE THOSE LABS

21:35.367 --> 21:36.834
WOULD WORK INDEPENDENTLY, TAKING

21:36.834 --> 21:38.300
IN EVIDENCE AND SPITTING OUT

21:38.300 --> 21:40.000
RESULTS.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.633
BUT MANY LABS WORK CLOSELY WITH

21:41.633 --> 21:43.133
LAW ENFORCEMENT, KNOWING

21:43.133 --> 21:44.567
DETAILS OF THE CASE

21:44.567 --> 21:45.800
THEY'RE WORKING ON,

21:45.800 --> 21:47.400
WHICH CAN PREJUDICE THEIR WORK,

21:47.400 --> 21:49.367
EVEN SUBCONSCIOUSLY.

21:49.367 --> 21:50.367
>> SOMETIMES IT'S NOT

21:50.367 --> 21:51.667
INTENTIONAL FRAUD.

21:51.667 --> 21:55.200
BUT RATHER SOMETHING MUCH MORE

21:55.200 --> 21:57.333
INADVERTENT, WHICH IS THE KIND

21:57.333 --> 21:59.667
OF BIAS THAT CAN COME FROM

21:59.667 --> 22:00.967
FEELING LIKE YOU'RE PART

22:00.967 --> 22:02.633
OF A SIDE, PART OF A TEAM, THAT

22:02.633 --> 22:03.633
YOU'RE PART OF -- YOU'RE

22:03.633 --> 22:05.834
ATTACHED TO THE PROSECUTION

22:05.834 --> 22:10.300
AND YOU WANT TO GET THE BAD GUY.

22:10.300 --> 22:14.066
>> John: YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT

22:14.066 --> 22:17.200
THEIR JOB AT ALL.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.300
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE NEUTRAL.

22:18.300 --> 22:18.800
IF A REFEREE STARTED

22:18.800 --> 22:20.033
PARTICIPATING IN A TEAM'S

22:20.033 --> 22:21.567
END ZONE CELEBRATION, YOU'D HAVE

22:21.567 --> 22:24.600
SOME SERIOUS FUCKING QUESTIONS,

22:24.600 --> 22:25.467
LIKE "WHY HAVE YOU PICKED

22:25.467 --> 22:26.467
A SIDE?"

22:26.467 --> 22:27.033
AND "HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN

22:27.033 --> 22:27.700
PRACTICING THE DIRTY BIRD?"

22:27.700 --> 22:28.433
SO, CLEARLY, A LOT NEEDS TO BE

22:28.433 --> 22:29.734
FIXED.

22:29.734 --> 22:30.967
AND SOME STATES HAVE STEPPED UP.

22:30.967 --> 22:32.667
ONE HAS DONE A LOT, INCLUDING

22:32.667 --> 22:34.333
PASSING THE COUNTRY'S FIRST

22:34.333 --> 22:36.233
"JUNK SCIENCE" LAW, WHICH

22:36.233 --> 22:40.567
ENABLES CONVICTS TO APPEAL IF

22:40.567 --> 22:43.834
-- REQUEST A NEW TRIAL IF THE

22:43.834 --> 22:44.734
SCIENTIST USED TO CONVICT THEM

22:44.734 --> 22:47.533
WAS FLAWED.

22:47.533 --> 22:48.367
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.000
AND THE PIONEERING STATE THAT

22:49.000 --> 22:49.467
DID THAT, BY THE WAY?

22:49.467 --> 22:50.400
TEXAS!

22:50.400 --> 22:51.000
YES, I KNOW!

22:51.000 --> 22:51.800
YOU DON'T EXPECT TEXAS TO LEAD

22:51.800 --> 22:53.400
THE NATION IN SCIENCE-RELATED

22:53.400 --> 22:55.033
CRIMINAL-JUSTICE REFORM.

22:55.033 --> 22:56.467
YOU EXPECT THEM TO LEAD

22:56.467 --> 22:57.667
THE NATION IN REMEMBERING THE

22:57.667 --> 22:59.367
ALAMO OR NAMING THEIR CHILDREN

22:59.367 --> 23:01.233
"FOOTBALL."

23:01.233 --> 23:02.734
I LOVE YOU, FOOTBALL, BUT IF YOU

23:02.734 --> 23:04.033
EVER FORGET THE ALAMO,

23:04.033 --> 23:06.200
WE ARE DONE.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.900
SADLY, AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL,

23:07.900 --> 23:09.266
PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOWER.

23:09.266 --> 23:10.000
ALTHOUGH ONE GROUP,

23:10.000 --> 23:10.900
THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON

23:10.900 --> 23:12.100
FORENSIC SCIENCE, HAS TRIED

23:12.100 --> 23:12.867
TO FIX THAT.

23:12.867 --> 23:14.500
THEY WERE FOUNDED TO ADVISE THE

23:14.500 --> 23:16.667
DOJ ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE MANY

23:16.667 --> 23:19.300
PROBLEMS YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT,

23:19.300 --> 23:21.433
AND THEIR MOST RECENT MEETING

23:21.433 --> 23:22.633
FEATURED POWERFUL REMARKS FROM

23:22.633 --> 23:23.767
KEITH HARWARD, WHO SPENT 33

23:23.767 --> 23:26.800
YEARS IN PRISON FOR A CRIME HE

23:26.800 --> 23:27.934
DIDN'T COMMIT, BASED ON FAULTY

23:27.934 --> 23:29.633
BITE MARK EVIDENCE.

23:29.633 --> 23:30.734
>> SOME WOULD SAY, WELL, YOU'RE

23:30.734 --> 23:34.133
A FREE MAN.

23:34.133 --> 23:35.700
I WILL NEVER BE FREE OF THIS.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.333
THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.300
EXCUSE ME IF I GET EMOTIONAL.

23:40.300 --> 23:43.734
THAT I SPENT MORE THAN HALF

23:43.734 --> 23:48.867
MY LIFE IN PRISON BEHIND THE

23:48.867 --> 23:54.800
OPINIONS AND THE EXPERT EGOS

23:54.800 --> 23:57.066
OF TWO ODONTOLOGISTS.

23:57.066 --> 23:58.133
THERE'S A DEATH PENALTY CASE

23:58.133 --> 23:59.233
IN PENNSYLVANIA THAT'S GOING ON

23:59.233 --> 24:00.934
NOW, AND THE JUDGE IS GOING TO

24:00.934 --> 24:03.567
ALLOW BITE MARK EVIDENCE.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.033
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO BE

24:05.033 --> 24:06.567
WRONGLY CONVICTED BEFORE THEY

24:06.567 --> 24:09.967
REALIZE THAT THIS STUFF'S ALL

24:09.967 --> 24:17.233
BOGUS, IT'S ALL MADE UP?

24:17.233 --> 24:19.266
>> John: THAT'S A GOOD

24:19.266 --> 24:20.300
QUESTION.

24:20.300 --> 24:20.934
THAT'S THE KIND OF SPEECH THAT

24:20.934 --> 24:21.567
COULD REALLY INSPIRE THAT

24:21.567 --> 24:22.166
COMMISSION TO DO A LOT OF GOOD

24:22.166 --> 24:22.667
WORK.

24:22.667 --> 24:23.300
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT WAS ACTUALLY

24:23.300 --> 24:29.700
THEIR FINAL MEETING.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.567
BECAUSE THE COMMISSION WAS

24:31.567 --> 24:33.266
SHUT DOWN IN APRIL BY ATTORNEY

24:33.266 --> 24:33.934
GENERAL AND XENOPHOBIC BOSS BABY

24:33.934 --> 24:34.400
JEFF SESSIONS.

24:34.400 --> 24:34.934
AND THAT SHOULDN'T REALLY

24:34.934 --> 24:35.900
SURPRISE YOU.

24:35.900 --> 24:36.533
SESSIONS IS A FORMER PROSECUTOR,

24:36.533 --> 24:37.333
AND SEEMS LIKE THE KIND OF GUY

24:37.333 --> 24:37.867
WHO SAW "DEAD MAN WALKING"

24:37.867 --> 24:38.500
AND WAS LIKE "HURRY UP!

24:38.500 --> 24:39.667
LET'S KILL THIS GUY ALREADY!

24:39.667 --> 24:40.734
THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE CALLED DEAD

24:40.734 --> 24:43.467
MAN DILLY-DALLYING!"

24:43.467 --> 24:44.533
LET'S GO.

24:44.533 --> 24:46.333
SO WE MAY BE ACTIVELY GOING

24:46.333 --> 24:47.633
BACKWARDS ON THIS ISSUE, WHICH

24:47.633 --> 24:48.867
IS DANGEROUS, BECAUSE NOT ONLY

24:48.867 --> 24:50.934
ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE GETTING

24:50.934 --> 24:52.300
CONVICTED, GUILTY CRIMINALS ARE

24:52.300 --> 24:52.934
BEING LEFT ON THE STREETS

24:52.934 --> 24:54.367
AS A RESULT.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.767
AND IF THIS ADMINISTRATION

24:55.767 --> 24:57.567
DOESN'T SEE THIS AS A PROBLEM,

24:57.567 --> 24:59.400
THEN WE SHOULD AT LEAST DO MORE

24:59.400 --> 25:00.600
TO EDUCATE POTENTIAL JURORS

25:00.600 --> 25:01.467
ABOUT SOME SHORTCOMINGS

25:01.467 --> 25:03.567
OF OUR SYSTEM.

25:03.567 --> 25:05.000
AND ONE SMALL WAY TO DO THAT

25:05.000 --> 25:12.066
MIGHT BE THIS.

25:12.066 --> 25:15.166
>> IN THIS CD WHEN THE HEAT

25:15.166 --> 25:16.266
RISES.

25:16.266 --> 25:20.100
SO DOES THE MURDER RATE.

25:20.100 --> 25:23.233
♪ ♪

25:23.233 --> 25:25.633
>> ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.

25:25.633 --> 25:27.233
LET'S GET THIS STUFF BACK TO THE

25:27.233 --> 25:27.400
LAB.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.266
>> NO NEED.

25:28.266 --> 25:29.300
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

25:29.300 --> 25:31.333
A BITE MARK.

25:31.333 --> 25:42.867
THAT'S WHAT I CALL DEAD MEAT.

25:42.867 --> 25:44.967
>> THIS FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?

25:44.967 --> 25:47.266
>> THIS IS MURDER.

25:47.266 --> 25:48.467
THAT'S A HUMAN PERSON.

25:48.467 --> 25:51.333
>> THAT'S HIS WIFE OVER THERE.

25:51.333 --> 25:55.300
YOU ARE A FUCKING ASSHOLE.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.133
>> HE DOESN'T LIKE TO PLAY BY

25:57.133 --> 25:57.800
THE RULES.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.467
>> IT IS FAR FROM CONCLUSIVE.

26:00.467 --> 26:02.667
>> WOULD YOU SAY THERE IS A

26:02.667 --> 26:03.467
REASONABLE DEGREE OF SCIENTIFIC

26:03.467 --> 26:04.834
CERTAINTY?

26:04.834 --> 26:06.633
THEO NO, THAT'S MEANINGLESS.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.433
>> RIGHT.

26:08.433 --> 26:09.467
>> THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR

26:09.467 --> 26:10.100
ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE AROUND HIM.

26:10.100 --> 26:13.834
>> CHIEF, THE HAIR MATCHES THE

26:13.834 --> 26:14.166
VICTIM'S WIFE.

26:14.166 --> 26:18.667
CASE CLOSED.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.667
>> MICROSCOPIC HAIR COMPARISON

26:20.667 --> 26:22.367
IS BULLSHIT SCIENCE.

26:22.367 --> 26:25.166
>> IRAN A MITOCHONDRIAL DNA TEST

26:25.166 --> 26:25.533
ON THE HAIRS.

26:25.533 --> 26:28.533
THERE WERE FIVE HATERS.

26:28.533 --> 26:32.467
THREE WERE FROM A COCONUT.

26:32.467 --> 26:35.867
>> ONE WAS FROM A CABBAGE PATCH

26:35.867 --> 26:36.033
KID.

26:36.033 --> 26:38.734
THE REMAINING ONE WAS FROM THIS

26:38.734 --> 26:39.500
GOLDEN RETRIEVER.

26:39.500 --> 26:43.900
>> THERE IS THE KILLER.

26:43.900 --> 26:46.333
>> THE VICTIM WAS SHOT.

26:46.333 --> 26:48.667
HOW COULD A DOG FIRE A GUN?

26:48.667 --> 26:50.300
>> THAT'S A BAD DOG RIGHT THERE,

26:50.300 --> 26:56.700
AND HE'S ABOUT TO FACE SOME ROOF

26:56.700 --> 26:56.934
JUSTICE.

26:56.934 --> 27:00.066
>> WE ARE INDOORS.

27:00.066 --> 27:00.700
FUCK YOU.

27:00.700 --> 27:03.066
>> HE WON'T STOP ASKING THE HARD

27:03.066 --> 27:03.467
QUESTIONS.

27:03.467 --> 27:06.200
>> HOW ABOUT A CERTAINLY

27:06.200 --> 27:07.333
REASONABLE SCIENCE DEGREE?

27:07.333 --> 27:10.667
>> NO.

27:10.667 --> 27:11.934
>> OKAY.

27:11.934 --> 27:14.867
>> HE IS PASSIONATE ABOUT HIS

27:14.867 --> 27:15.500
JOB DESPITE NOT FULLY

27:15.500 --> 27:17.166
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT JOB IS.

27:17.166 --> 27:19.100
>> IF WE DON'T HAVE SOMETHING

27:19.100 --> 27:19.967
SOLID BY TOMORROW, THE D.A. IS

27:19.967 --> 27:26.100
GOING TO HAVE MY ASS.

27:26.100 --> 27:28.500
>> WE DON'T WORK FOR THE D.A.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.467
WE DON'T WORK FOR THE D.A.

27:30.467 --> 27:32.700
YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?

27:32.700 --> 27:33.900
PLEASE TELL US TO UNDERSTAND

27:33.900 --> 27:34.100
THAT.

27:34.100 --> 27:37.967
>> WELL YEAH, I UNDERSTAND THAT

27:37.967 --> 27:38.200
TOTALLY.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.100
>> THERE IS NO WAY HE UNDERSTAND

27:39.100 --> 27:44.266
THAT BECAUSE THIS GUY WILL NOT

27:44.266 --> 27:44.467
QUITE.

27:44.467 --> 27:46.533
>> HOW ABOUT A CERTAINLY

27:46.533 --> 27:46.934
REASONABLE --

27:46.934 --> 27:48.300
>> STOP TALKING.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.200
>> KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.100
>> EVEN WHEN HIS TEAM ABANDONS

27:53.100 --> 27:55.500
HIM, HE'S NOT AFRAID TO CALL FOR

27:55.500 --> 27:55.734
BACKUP.

27:55.734 --> 27:57.500
>> IT'S BETTER TO BE GOOD.

27:57.500 --> 27:58.834
I BROUGHT IN SOME EXPERT HELP,

27:58.834 --> 28:00.700
WITNESSES TO HELP LOCK IN THE

28:00.700 --> 28:01.133
CASE.

28:01.133 --> 28:01.800
TAKE A LOOK.

28:01.800 --> 28:05.500
WE'VE GOT A FORENSIC DENTIST,

28:05.500 --> 28:08.367
TWIN BOY DETECTIVES, UNROLL TINY

28:08.367 --> 28:11.333
PROSPECTOR, MAGIC EIGHT BALLS,

28:11.333 --> 28:14.266
AND THE COUNTIES FOR FOREMOST

28:14.266 --> 28:15.100
CRIME SNIFFING PONY.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.900
>> NONE OF THIS IS ADMISSIBLE IN

28:17.900 --> 28:18.100
COURT.

28:18.100 --> 28:19.767
>> THREE OF THEM HAVE TESTIFIED

28:19.767 --> 28:21.934
IN COURT BEFORE AND THEY GOT

28:21.934 --> 28:22.500
CONVICTIONS.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.467
>> IS THAT THE BALONEY EVIDENCE?

28:25.467 --> 28:33.934
>> CSI CRIME SCENE IDIOT.

28:33.934 --> 28:35.533
THE ONE BEFORE WE GO, IF YOU

28:35.533 --> 28:37.900
WANT OR IF YOU ARE ABLE TO HELP

28:37.900 --> 28:38.500
RELIEF EFFORTS IN PUERTO RICO,

28:38.500 --> 28:40.900
YOU CAN GIVE HERE.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.266
THAT'S OUR SHOW TONIGHT.

28:42.266 --> 28:43.700
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

28:43.700 --> 28:44.266
WE WILL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

28:44.266 --> 28:48.266
GOOD NIGHT.
