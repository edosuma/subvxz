01:04.186 --> 01:07.187
Why do we keep
remaking old trends?

01:07.189 --> 01:08.422
Shit.

01:08.424 --> 01:11.559
How are we breathing new life
into the old?

01:11.561 --> 01:13.596
Are we adding something new?

01:14.797 --> 01:18.800
If there is no soul,
there cannot be life.

01:18.802 --> 01:20.303
So, do we cater
to the masses

01:21.805 --> 01:26.676
or do we create art only for
the few who dare experience it?

01:27.477 --> 01:30.713
Oh, well, well, well.

01:35.351 --> 01:36.520
And what excuse is it this time

01:37.888 --> 01:41.157
for interrupting the energy flow
of the start of the day

01:42.326 --> 01:45.460
by dropping in
just whenever you see fit?

01:45.462 --> 01:46.430
Hmm?

01:48.297 --> 01:50.231
Rose Miller!

01:50.233 --> 01:51.867
I'm addressing you, yeah?

01:51.869 --> 01:55.673
You disrupt my day, and you have
nothing to say for yourself?

01:57.474 --> 01:59.374
Well, I was almost in a car
accident this morning...

01:59.376 --> 02:01.245
I don't want
your bullshit excuses!

02:01.980 --> 02:04.446
I want you in to work on time!

02:11.790 --> 02:13.757
Something funny to you?

02:29.040 --> 02:30.909
Schadenfreude.

02:32.711 --> 02:35.947
The pleasure derived from
someone else's misfortune.

02:42.387 --> 02:44.887
<i>Danke schoen,</i> my sweet Rose.

02:44.889 --> 02:46.723
Relax.

02:46.725 --> 02:49.325
You helped me illustrate
a point.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.766
Everyone, come close.
Everyone, come close.

02:55.433 --> 02:56.367
In each one of us,

02:57.603 --> 02:59.638
there is someone
we don't want to show the world.

03:01.339 --> 03:03.975
A part of us that takes pleasure
in seeing those around us fail.

03:05.677 --> 03:11.815
A dark passenger who wants the
self to persevere at any cost.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.317
This is human psychology, hmm?

03:14.319 --> 03:17.256
And this is what my new
collection embraces.

03:17.957 --> 03:20.491
The dark night of the soul.

03:20.493 --> 03:23.029
That is Schadenfreude.

03:39.712 --> 03:41.848
Gunter needs these finished
before tonight.

03:42.849 --> 03:45.385
Mm, got it.
Thank you, Aurora.

03:47.621 --> 03:49.086
Why don't you just throw down
the whole carcass

03:49.088 --> 03:50.523
while you're at it?

03:53.459 --> 03:54.560
Hey, Rose.

03:55.796 --> 03:57.061
I have a fun idea.

03:57.063 --> 03:59.566
You're going to the show
tonight, right?

04:00.133 --> 04:01.666
Unfortunately, yes.

04:01.668 --> 04:03.802
We should go to the after
party together.

04:03.804 --> 04:06.606
We can have some fun,
blow off some steam.

04:06.973 --> 04:07.808
Nah.

04:10.044 --> 04:12.010
Uh, what?

04:12.012 --> 04:13.747
It's essentially a waste
of time.

04:15.381 --> 04:17.148
I mean, it's good for people
that are good at networking.

04:17.149 --> 04:19.149
But I don't know,

04:19.152 --> 04:21.387
I'm just better at letting
my work speak for itself.

04:22.622 --> 04:24.992
Even though apparently
it doesn't say anything.

04:31.933 --> 04:33.534
Why don't you be my date?

04:35.503 --> 04:36.768
What?

04:36.770 --> 04:38.036
It doesn't have to be
anything serious,

04:38.038 --> 04:39.873
but I'd like to see you
tonight.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.076
Is that okay?

04:44.779 --> 04:47.081
Yeah, sure.

04:47.648 --> 04:48.783
Great.

04:49.717 --> 04:51.018
I'll see you tonight.

04:57.525 --> 04:59.527
Hey, Rose,
can you take this in for me?

05:01.461 --> 05:03.128
I need to go down another size.

05:03.130 --> 05:03.831
This is ridiculous.

05:05.533 --> 05:08.133
If you went down another size,
Chels, it would be ridiculous.

05:08.135 --> 05:10.803
Nothing tastes as good
as skinny feels.

05:10.805 --> 05:12.573
Well, I never eat anything
processed and I feel great.

05:13.641 --> 05:15.441
I don't know how
you even stay alive.

05:15.443 --> 05:16.879
I could never do the whole
vegetarian thing.

05:17.913 --> 05:20.180
I mean, how do you give up
bacon?

05:20.182 --> 05:22.484
I don't know, I just don't like
hurting anything.

05:24.018 --> 05:26.121
Doesn't it ever bother you that
you're eating something dead?

05:27.722 --> 05:30.556
You're either the food,
or the thing eating the food.

05:30.558 --> 05:32.225
What do you even eat?

05:32.227 --> 05:34.395
I don't know, organics.

05:35.097 --> 05:36.231
B12 supplements for energy.

05:38.066 --> 05:41.635
You know, even a lot of meat
eaters don't get enough B12.

05:41.637 --> 05:43.470
It's really important... oh!

05:43.472 --> 05:45.106
Rose,
you've got to live a little.

05:45.108 --> 05:47.110
I really do worry about you.

05:48.509 --> 05:51.113
Come to the party with me after?

05:52.948 --> 05:55.851
Um, actually, I was already
planning on going.

05:57.085 --> 05:57.719
Brad sort of invited me.

05:58.787 --> 06:01.222
Shut up.
It finally happened?

06:01.224 --> 06:02.957
It's not a big deal.

06:02.959 --> 06:04.761
We're just meeting there after,

06:05.929 --> 06:09.530
but, um, he did sort of call me
his date.

06:09.532 --> 06:12.499
Oh, my God, Rose!
This is so good for you.

06:12.501 --> 06:13.602
What are you wearing?

06:14.670 --> 06:15.204
Hmm?

06:16.139 --> 06:18.739
Oh, I mean, probably this.

06:18.741 --> 06:20.542
No!

06:21.510 --> 06:21.844
Yeah.

06:22.879 --> 06:25.579
No, and don't say that
to anyone,

06:25.581 --> 06:26.881
not even as a joke.

06:26.883 --> 06:28.250
I'm going to pick something out.

06:28.252 --> 06:30.017
It's going to be fun,

06:30.019 --> 06:31.721
and you're going to look hot.

06:42.899 --> 06:44.033
Ross?

06:44.734 --> 06:45.933
No, uh, Rose.

06:45.935 --> 06:47.670
First name.
Last name, Miller.

06:48.738 --> 06:49.940
And they put you on here
tonight?

06:51.108 --> 06:52.743
Yeah, I should be.
I did the list myself.

06:53.110 --> 06:54.178
Uh-huh.

06:55.245 --> 06:56.578
Hey, baby.

06:56.580 --> 06:57.881
What's up, baby?

07:00.550 --> 07:03.619
Okay, Rose Miller.

07:04.254 --> 07:07.990
Rose... Miller.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.558
Ah, here we are.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.095
All right, have yourself
a good night.

07:12.696 --> 07:13.731
Yeah.

07:14.231 --> 07:15.097
Ladies!

07:15.099 --> 07:15.933
Thank you.

07:30.180 --> 07:31.548
Hey, Rose!

07:33.151 --> 07:34.217
Sorry, what?

07:34.219 --> 07:35.120
It's loud in here.

07:36.620 --> 07:37.686
Come on.

07:45.864 --> 07:46.965
Better?

07:47.598 --> 07:48.699
Yeah.

07:50.301 --> 07:51.633
You look hideous.

07:53.972 --> 07:54.506
Thank you.

07:54.939 --> 07:56.975
You look... you look nice.

08:00.379 --> 08:01.146
Shit.

08:04.716 --> 08:06.651
Don't you want to say hi
to the boss?

08:07.053 --> 08:08.751
No, I do not.

08:08.753 --> 08:12.223
I make myself look like an idiot
every time I'm in front of him.

08:12.824 --> 08:14.025
Who cares?

08:14.859 --> 08:16.294
It's a transition job.

08:17.329 --> 08:20.264
My passion is photojournalism.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.898
It's stupid.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.800
I mean, it's not stupid,
but it's...

08:23.802 --> 08:27.139
It doesn't pay much,
so I do this.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.341
Beats shooting weddings.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.313
Can I ask you why
photojournalism?

08:35.381 --> 08:35.980
Yeah, um...

08:37.249 --> 08:40.716
Well, for me, true beauty
lies within the things

08:40.717 --> 08:41.719
we have yet to uncover.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.657
To be part of the discoveries,
to be a part of history.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.760
You ever want to be a part
of something bigger?

08:48.794 --> 08:50.796
What is it you really want
to do?

08:51.864 --> 08:52.996
Well, I want to...

08:52.998 --> 08:54.034
I want to work in fashion.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.303
Yeah, but after that.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.005
Oh.

09:01.674 --> 09:02.806
- Shit, I...
- It's fine.

09:02.808 --> 09:03.541
No, I'm sorry.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.209
- No, it's stupid.
- Awkward.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.246
Don't worry.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.114
Don't take this the wrong way,

09:09.116 --> 09:13.686
but why would you ever want
to work in fashion?

09:14.988 --> 09:17.691
I just love the way
that clothes make you feel.

09:18.426 --> 09:21.194
You can literally be anybody,

09:21.995 --> 09:23.029
become anything.

09:23.896 --> 09:24.997
It's like armor, you know?

09:26.366 --> 09:28.466
When you walk out the door,
you're arming yourself.

09:28.468 --> 09:31.202
That's why I want to design.
I want to help...

09:31.204 --> 09:33.206
I want to help people
feel strong.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.809
I want to help them...

09:37.944 --> 09:39.045
Yeah, it's stupid.
You were right.

09:39.880 --> 09:40.881
- No.
- No, it's...

09:41.282 --> 09:42.348
- It's not.
- It's fine.

09:42.350 --> 09:43.783
What you just said to me,

09:44.385 --> 09:46.053
you need to tell Gunter.

09:46.487 --> 09:47.418
Come on.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.486
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.420
No, I can't!

09:49.422 --> 09:50.989
You can, it's fine.
I'll come with you!

09:50.991 --> 09:52.056
I literally can't.

09:52.058 --> 09:52.926
He loves me.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.294
I borrowed this
from his collection.

09:55.296 --> 09:57.031
I'm not supposed to be
wearing it.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.065
What?

10:00.067 --> 10:01.000
Yeah.

10:01.002 --> 10:02.234
This is Gunter's?

10:02.236 --> 10:03.271
He would kill me.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.007
Again.

10:07.108 --> 10:09.175
You are full of secrets.

10:09.177 --> 10:10.312
Yup.

10:10.912 --> 10:12.012
Wow.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.248
Is he still there?

10:15.883 --> 10:17.285
No, um...

10:18.519 --> 10:22.757
It, uh, looks like your secret's
safe with me.

10:32.034 --> 10:33.368
Where are my manners?

10:36.804 --> 10:38.940
Can I get you a drink?

10:41.008 --> 10:42.076
Sure.

10:42.777 --> 10:44.179
What do you want?

10:45.080 --> 10:47.049
Anything. Surprise me.

10:48.951 --> 10:50.419
I thought I just did.

10:53.556 --> 10:54.890
I'll be back.

11:21.017 --> 11:22.885
Shh!

11:24.987 --> 11:26.420
Oh, my God.

11:26.422 --> 11:29.189
Did you see Rose Miller
with Brad Hart?

11:29.191 --> 11:30.993
Oh, my God,
how could I miss Scarface?

11:32.061 --> 11:34.395
I can't believe
she actually came.

11:34.397 --> 11:36.966
Chels told me she asked Brad
to ask her out.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.033
Seriously?

11:39.035 --> 11:40.169
Chels does everything
for that girl. Why?

11:41.371 --> 11:44.071
I don't know, Chels's family
fostered Rose or something.

11:44.073 --> 11:46.541
She lost her whole family
in a car accident.

11:46.543 --> 11:49.043
I mean, look at her face,
it must've been bad.

11:51.347 --> 11:53.047
I feel sorry for Brad.

11:53.049 --> 11:54.282
He's just too nice.

11:54.284 --> 11:55.883
Chelsea's too nice.

11:55.885 --> 11:57.318
I just don't get Rose.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.055
She's so weird and sad.

12:00.391 --> 12:02.257
You think Brad's gonna
give her a pity fuck?

12:02.259 --> 12:04.326
Oh, my God, totally.
He'd fuck anything.

12:13.570 --> 12:15.036
Okay, you good?

12:15.038 --> 12:16.238
Yeah, of course.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.472
Yeah, okay, just fucking go!

12:35.659 --> 12:38.896
Oh, my God, Rose.
You look good.

12:40.264 --> 12:42.030
Did you ask Brad
to bring me here?

12:42.032 --> 12:43.434
Oh, fuck. Who told you?

12:44.636 --> 12:46.170
God, I am so humiliated.

12:47.237 --> 12:48.406
Why would you do this to me?

12:49.106 --> 12:51.309
You really liked him
and he was into it.

12:53.011 --> 12:54.577
Great, yeah, I'm glad
he was really into it.

12:54.579 --> 12:55.447
That's not what I meant!

12:56.281 --> 12:57.882
What did you mean, Chels?

12:58.550 --> 13:00.349
I didn't ask you for help.

13:00.351 --> 13:02.219
I don't want to be here.

13:03.488 --> 13:06.021
I don't need any more
charity from you, okay?

13:06.023 --> 13:07.557
Rose, this isn't charity.

13:07.559 --> 13:09.427
You're like family to me.
Don't do this!

13:11.096 --> 13:13.096
Rose!
I was only trying to help!

13:13.098 --> 13:14.165
Rose!

13:15.467 --> 13:16.567
Rose!

13:17.703 --> 13:19.538
Rose, fuck! Fuck!

13:30.048 --> 13:32.350
<i>Dr. Mantel, obstetrics.</i>

13:38.491 --> 13:40.124
Rose?

13:40.126 --> 13:42.159
Oh, my goodness. Rose?

13:42.161 --> 13:42.995
Someone get in here!

13:43.596 --> 13:45.697
Sweetheart, it's okay.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.164
Please don't move.

13:47.166 --> 13:50.336
Doctor! She's up! Nurse?

13:51.069 --> 13:52.603
Hey, hey, hey.

13:52.605 --> 13:54.438
You're going to be okay.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.273
Do you remember what happened?

13:56.275 --> 13:57.508
The accident?

13:57.510 --> 13:59.243
You got hurt.

13:59.245 --> 14:01.478
I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.182
Well, you're awake.

14:04.016 --> 14:06.586
Welcome back, Ms. Miller.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.524
Now, can we raise you up?

14:14.627 --> 14:16.661
Do you remember
what happened?

14:16.663 --> 14:18.364
There was an accident.

14:19.198 --> 14:20.700
Please don't try to talk.

14:21.601 --> 14:23.368
You've been out for a week,

14:23.370 --> 14:26.339
and we're very happy
to have you back with us.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.776
Now, my name is Dr. Keloid,

14:30.778 --> 14:34.245
I'm the attending physician
at St. Agnes'.

14:34.247 --> 14:36.548
Okay, look at me.

14:36.550 --> 14:38.184
Okay.

14:40.754 --> 14:42.222
Do you remember
what brought you here?

14:43.423 --> 14:46.059
There was damage on your face,
I'm afraid,

14:47.194 --> 14:48.128
particularly your jaw.

14:49.196 --> 14:51.497
Some of it couldn't be
reattached,

14:51.499 --> 14:54.567
so we had to wire it shut
for now

14:54.569 --> 14:57.236
until we can talk about
reconstruction options.

14:57.238 --> 14:58.439
It's okay.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.741
The bike punctured
your abdomen,

15:03.410 --> 15:06.645
and it ripped out a significant
portion of your intestine.

15:08.281 --> 15:10.281
But not to worry,
with a proper diet,

15:10.283 --> 15:13.254
you'll be able to live
a perfectly normal life

15:14.088 --> 15:16.222
with a shortened organ.

15:16.224 --> 15:19.126
Now, we only had
a Chelsea Cottrell

15:20.094 --> 15:22.461
listed as your emergency
contact.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.563
That's me.
Her parents are deceased.

15:24.565 --> 15:26.465
My parents were her foster
family.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.066
Oh, good, good.

15:28.068 --> 15:30.202
It's very important
that she have all the support

15:30.204 --> 15:31.804
she can get right now.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.359
Oh, of course.

15:53.194 --> 15:55.695
Now, I want you to keep in mind

15:55.697 --> 16:00.634
that this is going to be
a process,

16:00.636 --> 16:03.205
just like everything else
in life.

16:05.842 --> 16:08.776
I don't think there's any point

16:08.778 --> 16:12.714
in your worrying about
the aesthetic right now.

16:19.321 --> 16:20.422
Good.

16:24.761 --> 16:27.564
And good, yeah.

16:28.565 --> 16:30.600
Good, easy there.

16:35.437 --> 16:37.439
Right, give her the mirror.

16:51.454 --> 16:54.655
It's okay, it's okay.

16:54.657 --> 16:58.627
We strongly suggest staying away
from mirrors right now.

17:01.296 --> 17:04.799
You have to focus
on your rest and recovery.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.567
We have more than a few weeks

17:06.569 --> 17:11.339
before we can even think about
you leaving this room.

17:13.276 --> 17:15.175
I know it's a lot to take in.

17:15.178 --> 17:17.412
Please take your time.

17:17.414 --> 17:19.848
We'll give you some privacy.

17:23.453 --> 17:24.686
Hey.

17:26.356 --> 17:27.691
You okay?

17:44.876 --> 17:46.441
You're alive,

17:46.443 --> 17:48.445
and that's the most important
thing.

17:56.220 --> 17:57.820
I'm sorry, Rose.

17:57.822 --> 17:59.421
It's really competitive.

18:03.327 --> 18:06.663
But hey, Gunter didn't
charge you for the dress.

18:08.266 --> 18:11.433
Rose, you are like a sister
to me.

18:11.435 --> 18:12.835
I know you don't let people in

18:12.837 --> 18:14.436
and I'm sure you have
your reasons,

18:14.438 --> 18:16.507
but I'm not going anywhere.

18:17.307 --> 18:19.575
I'm sorry I fucked up,

18:19.577 --> 18:21.245
but I'm gonna make it up
to you.

18:22.247 --> 18:24.247
I had to move your stuff
somewhere

18:24.249 --> 18:26.950
so I moved it into my place.

18:26.952 --> 18:29.487
You've seen it. It's huge.

18:30.690 --> 18:32.925
It's important you're not alone
right now.

18:35.527 --> 18:37.362
Oh, sweetheart.

18:37.929 --> 18:39.562
Hey, hey, hey.

18:40.999 --> 18:42.634
It'll be all right, okay?

18:44.269 --> 18:46.471
Okay, and here we go!

18:47.039 --> 18:49.006
Ta-da! You're home.

18:49.008 --> 18:50.674
I unpacked some of your stuff,

18:50.676 --> 18:52.810
but I didn't want to do
the whole serial killer thing

18:52.812 --> 18:56.849
and go through everything,
so some of it's still in boxes.

18:58.751 --> 19:00.483
Fridge is here,

19:00.485 --> 19:02.786
and filled with organic veggies
because I love you.

19:02.788 --> 19:04.588
Oh, I even got some organic
baby food,

19:04.590 --> 19:07.024
I've been eating it
and it's, like, amazing.

19:07.026 --> 19:09.526
Blender is over here.

19:09.528 --> 19:11.295
It comes one cup per serving.

19:11.297 --> 19:12.996
So, you can just put your slurry
in there

19:12.998 --> 19:14.567
and whack it in the machine
when it's done!

19:15.634 --> 19:18.770
I think I even found
a pomegranate.

19:18.772 --> 19:21.039
Oh, right. No seeds, sorry.

19:21.041 --> 19:23.474
Bedroom is here, and I'm there,

19:23.476 --> 19:25.811
so, like, right there
if you need me.

19:32.418 --> 19:33.684
Don't mention it.

19:33.686 --> 19:37.589
I've got to grab a few things
so I'll be back in two hours,

19:37.591 --> 19:39.023
four if traffic is shit.

19:39.025 --> 19:40.494
Can I get you anything?

19:41.661 --> 19:42.929
Are you going to be okay?

19:43.563 --> 19:44.763
Really yes?

19:44.765 --> 19:47.366
Or you don't want me to feel bad
for having to go out, yes?

19:52.438 --> 19:53.671
Okay, good.

19:53.673 --> 19:55.073
Please help yourself
to anything.

19:55.075 --> 19:57.008
This is your home now, too.
Okay?

19:57.010 --> 20:01.080
Um, I left Brad's e-mail
by your computer.

20:01.082 --> 20:02.049
I gave him yours.

20:03.350 --> 20:05.751
He feels really bad,
but never mind.

20:05.753 --> 20:07.688
You just take care of you!

20:08.890 --> 20:11.790
I'm sorry I fucked things up
between you two.

20:11.792 --> 20:13.625
He really is a nice guy.

20:13.627 --> 20:15.360
He helped me move your stuff in.

20:15.362 --> 20:16.496
So sweet.

20:18.398 --> 20:20.034
I'm happy you're here.

24:23.649 --> 24:25.751
<i>Transhumanism.</i>

24:28.054 --> 24:32.023
<i>The belief or theory that
the human race can evolve</i>

24:32.025 --> 24:34.692
<i>beyond its current physical
and mental limitations,</i>

24:35.995 --> 24:40.633
<i>especially by means of science
and technology.</i>

24:41.867 --> 24:43.667
<i>The term "transhumanism"</i>

24:43.669 --> 24:45.803
<i>originated in a paper
from Canadian philosopher</i>

24:45.805 --> 24:48.872
<i>W.D. Lightfall in 1940.</i>

24:48.874 --> 24:53.378
<i>In 1957, biologist Julian
Huxley would use the same</i>

24:53.380 --> 24:55.647
<i>as a title for his own paper
on the subject,</i>

24:55.649 --> 24:59.650
<i>and go on to be known
as the founder of the movement.</i>

24:59.652 --> 25:03.687
<i>He theorized that the human
species can, if it wishes,</i>

25:03.689 --> 25:06.825
<i>transcend itself not
just sporadically,</i>

25:06.827 --> 25:08.960
<i>an individual here in one way,</i>

25:08.962 --> 25:11.362
<i>an individual there
in another way,</i>

25:11.364 --> 25:14.768
<i>but in its entirety,
as humanity.</i>

25:16.036 --> 25:18.036
<i>Despite the clear benefits
of the movement,</i>

25:18.038 --> 25:21.706
<i>FDA restrictions threatened
to eliminate any advancements.</i>

25:21.708 --> 25:24.375
<i>The Burroughs Clinic found
an opportunity</i>

25:24.377 --> 25:26.444
<i>within the challenge.</i>

25:26.446 --> 25:28.081
<i>In exchange for minimal

25:29.282 --> 25:31.883
<i>families involved
in the Burroughs tests</i>

25:31.885 --> 25:35.454
<i>were supplied with a lifetime
of complete medical coverage,</i>

25:35.456 --> 25:38.090
<i>with opportunities
for special cases</i>

25:38.092 --> 25:40.059
<i>to experience medical
breakthroughs</i>

25:40.061 --> 25:43.129
<i>that are currently unavailable

25:43.131 --> 25:45.133
<i>We look forward to hearing
from you.</i>

26:14.428 --> 26:15.861
Wow!

26:15.863 --> 26:18.230
I would do some pretty
sketchy things

26:18.232 --> 26:20.701
to get free medical
from a place like this.

26:26.208 --> 26:28.710
Sorry, just trying to lighten
the mood.

26:29.311 --> 26:31.278
Ooh, I like her nose.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.746
Okay, sorry!

26:32.748 --> 26:34.350
We're here for you, not me.

26:35.384 --> 26:38.485
Okay, come on. Over here.

26:41.823 --> 26:43.058
You okay?

26:44.326 --> 26:46.228
Okay, oh, there she is.

26:50.933 --> 26:52.302
It's nice.

26:52.834 --> 26:54.834
Fancy.

26:54.836 --> 26:56.204
- Hello.
- Hello!

26:56.206 --> 26:58.141
We have an appointment
for Rose Miller.

26:59.308 --> 27:02.377
Uh, okay, just want
to sign in there.

27:03.845 --> 27:05.881
Right at the bottom.

27:12.155 --> 27:13.423
If I may.

27:28.804 --> 27:30.773
It is a pleasure to meet you.

27:31.407 --> 27:33.241
My wife, Cynthia, and I

27:33.243 --> 27:36.079
founded this institute
to help people like you.

27:37.213 --> 27:39.414
Your attending physician,
Keloid,

27:39.416 --> 27:41.285
brought your case
to our attention.

27:43.820 --> 27:45.322
He felt that you would be
an excellent candidate

27:46.156 --> 27:48.458
for one of our experimental
procedures.

27:49.292 --> 27:52.095
Stem cell manipulation.

27:53.129 --> 27:54.465
It's not a new science,

27:55.332 --> 27:57.000
but it is the key to life.

28:05.209 --> 28:07.843
If you qualify,
all costs are covered.

28:07.845 --> 28:08.846
And from what I've seen,

28:09.847 --> 28:10.980
you certainly fit
the necessary requirements.

28:12.216 --> 28:16.118
We live in a country that has,
in many ways,

28:16.120 --> 28:18.289
failed to meet the health care
needs of its citizens.

28:19.189 --> 28:21.624
We are a research facility,

28:21.626 --> 28:24.192
one of the leaders in
regenerative medicine,

28:24.194 --> 28:25.963
and we need human subjects
for our work.

28:27.097 --> 28:29.200
It's a mutually beneficial
arrangement.

28:37.609 --> 28:39.076
You will not be our first
patient,

28:39.511 --> 28:40.345
and certainly not our last.

28:41.646 --> 28:43.413
It's really a matter of
bureaucratic paperwork,

28:43.415 --> 28:45.114
in my opinion,

28:45.116 --> 28:47.283
that keeps life-changing
treatments like this

28:47.285 --> 28:50.086
from being made widely available
to the public.

28:50.088 --> 28:51.923
They are already being sold
to the most wealthy.

28:56.294 --> 28:58.496
Take a moment with your friend.

28:59.930 --> 29:01.932
I'll be right outside whenever
you're ready.

29:08.173 --> 29:09.841
Pretty good, right?

29:15.980 --> 29:17.648
Look, the hospital bills
were ridiculous,

29:17.650 --> 29:19.283
and I don't know if you've
looked

29:19.285 --> 29:19.985
at reconstructive payment
options.

29:21.253 --> 29:23.388
I don't know how those people
sleep at night.

29:37.002 --> 29:40.640
I know this is completely
unfair, Rose, but honestly?

29:41.508 --> 29:43.443
What do you have to lose?

29:47.011 --> 29:49.014
I'm sorry, come here,
sweetheart.

29:53.085 --> 29:56.088
We'll figure something out,
we will.

29:58.090 --> 29:59.291
Let me look at you.

32:35.417 --> 32:37.119
You the boyfriend?

32:37.854 --> 32:39.121
What?

32:39.556 --> 32:42.292
Oh. Uh, no.

32:43.192 --> 32:45.192
I'm just someone
who cares.

32:45.194 --> 32:47.597
Oh.
That's considerate.

32:48.766 --> 32:51.100
Do you have a moment
to speak about her?

32:52.703 --> 32:53.604
Sure.

33:00.476 --> 33:01.442
<i>You need it</i>

33:01.444 --> 33:04.145
<i>like you need
pernicious anemia.</i>

33:04.147 --> 33:05.914
<i>We don't like to hear</i>

33:05.916 --> 33:08.650
<i>the word "vampire" here.</i>

33:08.652 --> 33:11.920
<i>Trying to improve our PR.
"Interdependence"</i>

33:11.922 --> 33:14.189
<i>is the keyword.</i>

33:14.191 --> 33:17.259
<i>Enlightened interdependence.</i>

33:17.261 --> 33:20.195
<i>Life in all its rich variety.</i>

33:20.197 --> 33:22.363
<i>Take a little, leave a little.</i>

33:22.365 --> 33:26.167
<i>However,
by the inexorable logistics</i>

33:26.169 --> 33:27.369
<i>of the vampiric process...</i>

33:27.371 --> 33:29.204
Hmm.

33:29.206 --> 33:32.176
<i>...they always take more
than they leave.</i>

34:43.348 --> 34:44.648
Mmm.

35:07.941 --> 35:09.275
Hmm.

35:13.747 --> 35:15.716
Hmm.

35:52.886 --> 35:54.621
Are you okay?

36:14.641 --> 36:15.810
I'm recovering.

36:16.944 --> 36:19.346
Well, quite well,
from where I'm standing.

36:22.917 --> 36:24.852
You look familiar.

36:25.953 --> 36:28.257
You're not a fan
of daytime television?

36:33.028 --> 36:36.361
<i>Major Medical,</i>
starring Dominic Danvers

36:36.363 --> 36:38.065
as Dr. Tony Calabria.

36:43.371 --> 36:44.173
What are you
doing here?

36:45.473 --> 36:49.477
Uh, just a little
routine maintenance.

37:09.631 --> 37:10.833
Wow.

37:18.707 --> 37:19.709
Oh, my God.

37:20.409 --> 37:21.711
That's my line.

37:22.878 --> 37:23.712
Hey!

37:25.047 --> 37:26.114
Fuck.

37:29.751 --> 37:30.919
Fuck!

37:38.828 --> 37:40.864
I think I got up last night...

37:45.702 --> 37:47.834
and a strange...
Like, a dream,

37:47.836 --> 37:50.639
but I felt like
I was awake.

37:51.473 --> 37:52.809
Where did you go?

37:53.610 --> 37:55.078
The swimming pool.

38:00.783 --> 38:03.087
Dreams reveal so much
about the self.

38:04.687 --> 38:06.123
Open, please.

38:08.826 --> 38:11.794
Our inner truths,
desires.

38:16.766 --> 38:17.901
Our fears.

38:19.836 --> 38:21.138
Did you go into the water?

38:22.840 --> 38:24.608
Yeah. Yes, I did.

38:28.846 --> 38:31.647
In dreams,
water symbolizes emotion.

38:31.649 --> 38:33.781
To enter into
a pool of water

38:33.783 --> 38:38.220
suggests that you are
exploring your unconscious;

38:38.222 --> 38:40.057
trying to get to know,
understand,

38:41.058 --> 38:43.193
and appreciate yourself
more.

38:44.762 --> 38:47.631
It's a lovely dream,
one I've had myself.

38:48.532 --> 38:49.433
But sleep
is important.

38:50.168 --> 38:51.234
You mustn't
push yourself.

38:51.236 --> 38:52.201
If you push yourself
too hard,

38:52.203 --> 38:53.102
it can affect

38:53.104 --> 38:54.672
the way your mind
processes information.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.042
That's what gives you
this feeling of a waking dream.

38:59.076 --> 39:00.644
Your body
has been through a lot.

39:01.645 --> 39:03.614
You may feel weakened.

39:04.515 --> 39:06.952
Actually, I feel great.

39:08.786 --> 39:10.720
I feel strong. Very strong.

39:10.722 --> 39:11.790
Terrific.

39:13.925 --> 39:16.592
"Terrific" as in
I-can-go-home terrific?

39:16.594 --> 39:18.027
I insist.

39:18.029 --> 39:19.696
We'll want to see you
back here again

39:19.698 --> 39:20.897
to document
the healing process.

39:20.899 --> 39:22.098
Of course.

39:22.100 --> 39:24.169
But you can schedule that
on your way out.

39:25.870 --> 39:27.637
There are one or two
side effects

39:27.639 --> 39:29.975
of the procedure
that I should mention.

39:34.980 --> 39:39.617
We have created, essentially,
immortal skin grafts.

39:40.719 --> 39:43.821
Now, these medications
I'm giving you

39:43.823 --> 39:46.756
will help ease
the transformation.

39:46.758 --> 39:48.693
But when you're tired,
you must rest.

39:49.627 --> 39:51.594
Otherwise,
it can give you

39:51.596 --> 39:53.663
nausea, dizziness,

39:53.665 --> 39:56.767
even quite vivid
hallucinations.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.168
You're also going to have

39:58.170 --> 39:59.636
very specific dietary
requirements.

39:59.638 --> 40:01.305
Drink these
when you have difficulty

40:01.307 --> 40:02.706
keeping
other foods down.

40:02.708 --> 40:04.010
Can I ask you what's in them?

40:05.144 --> 40:07.278
A super protein
that's easy to digest

40:07.280 --> 40:09.014
and has been
specifically designed

40:09.016 --> 40:11.115
for your
nutritional requirements.

40:11.117 --> 40:12.118
It's nothing to worry about.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.920
Okay. Thank you,
Dr. Burroughs.

40:15.755 --> 40:17.156
Oh, you're welcome, Rose.

40:29.102 --> 40:31.204
Um, hi.

40:32.005 --> 40:34.338
Oh, my God. Rose?

40:34.340 --> 40:37.275
That's amazing!
Can they do me next?

40:37.277 --> 40:38.878
Let me look at you.

40:42.349 --> 40:43.749
Wow.

40:46.953 --> 40:47.952
What?

40:47.954 --> 40:49.821
No glasses?

40:49.823 --> 40:52.293
Well, I mean,
I don't need them anymore.

40:53.327 --> 40:55.894
Okay, Spider-Man.

40:55.896 --> 40:58.829
You're just...
You look so different.

40:58.831 --> 41:01.399
I'm still me, Chels.

41:01.401 --> 41:02.801
I'm so happy for you.

41:02.803 --> 41:04.271
Oh, thank you.

41:16.851 --> 41:18.084
I'm going to work.

41:18.086 --> 41:20.021
Call me if you
need anything, okay?

41:26.260 --> 41:26.993
Yeah.

41:27.994 --> 41:30.829
I'm not sure what to do
with myself all day.

41:30.831 --> 41:33.332
Maybe recover
from major surgery?

41:33.334 --> 41:35.801
Jesus, Rose.
You're the only person I know

41:35.803 --> 41:38.005
who gets time off
and wants to work.

41:40.041 --> 41:42.144
You should do something
for yourself for a change.

41:42.810 --> 41:43.678
Design.

41:44.146 --> 41:45.779
Feel inspired.

42:02.064 --> 42:03.997
<i>Um, I really appreciate you</i>

42:03.999 --> 42:06.001
<i>taking the time
to look at my work.</i>

42:06.902 --> 42:08.637
<i>These are very commercial.</i>

42:09.804 --> 42:11.804
<i>What you have created
is very polished</i>

42:11.806 --> 42:12.173
<i>and very pretty.</i>

42:13.174 --> 42:17.776
<i>But it's formulaic.
Boring. Safe.</i>

42:17.778 --> 42:19.348
<i>I have already
forgotten them.</i>

42:20.916 --> 42:24.019
<i>Who are you, Rose?
Do you know?</i>

42:25.387 --> 42:27.022
<i>I can take criticism.</i>

42:28.090 --> 42:29.758
<i>I can do better.</i>

42:30.926 --> 42:33.460
<i>Let me show you
something different.</i>

42:33.462 --> 42:35.262
<i>I've always wanted to be
a designer.</i>

42:35.264 --> 42:36.930
<i>I can do so much more
than you have...</i>

42:36.932 --> 42:38.901
Rose!

43:04.294 --> 43:06.095
Is there something
I can help you with?

43:07.130 --> 43:12.469
Hey, Rose.
Would you open the door?

43:21.978 --> 43:23.213
Holy shit.

43:24.981 --> 43:26.113
I mean, fuck.

43:26.115 --> 43:27.348
You look...

43:27.350 --> 43:28.517
Hideous, right?

43:28.519 --> 43:29.786
Nah.

43:31.221 --> 43:32.822
How did they do that?

43:34.325 --> 43:36.427
Experimental skin grafts.

43:37.328 --> 43:38.963
It's incredible.

43:40.264 --> 43:42.965
It's like the accident
never even happened.

43:42.967 --> 43:45.069
No.
It's not like it never happened.

43:46.135 --> 43:49.371
That's, um...
That's not what I meant.

43:49.373 --> 43:53.010
Uh, I'm just glad you're okay.

43:54.178 --> 43:55.510
Chels said to
leave you alone,

43:55.512 --> 43:58.949
so I figured you were
still staying there.

44:00.117 --> 44:02.987
Yeah. Well,
Chels says a lot of things.

44:03.488 --> 44:04.922
Yeah. She does.

44:06.091 --> 44:11.827
Um, I wanted to apologize
for everything.

44:11.829 --> 44:12.896
It's fine.

44:14.498 --> 44:16.432
But it was stupid of me to think

44:16.434 --> 44:18.534
you'd actually just ask me out,
right?

44:18.536 --> 44:19.901
Hey, come on.

44:19.903 --> 44:21.239
It's not like that.

44:22.407 --> 44:24.442
What do you say
I make it up to you, huh?

44:25.844 --> 44:28.177
Let me take you out
tonight.

44:28.179 --> 44:29.347
I'm busy tonight.

44:30.315 --> 44:31.414
What about tomorrow?

44:31.416 --> 44:33.285
I'm busy tomorrow, too.

44:36.254 --> 44:38.423
You're going to make this tough
on me, aren't you?

44:45.897 --> 44:46.931
No.

44:49.134 --> 44:50.336
Bye, Brad.

44:58.176 --> 45:00.343
You turned down Brad?

45:00.345 --> 45:01.544
Mm-hmm.

45:01.546 --> 45:03.279
I swear I had
nothing to do with that.

45:03.281 --> 45:05.148
It just feels bad.
I don't need his pity.

45:05.150 --> 45:07.016
Well, you know
you're pretty now, right?

45:07.018 --> 45:08.885
You don't have to
be nice.

45:08.887 --> 45:10.053
That's horrible.

45:11.090 --> 45:13.157
Oh, I'm glad you let me
drag you out tonight.

45:13.159 --> 45:14.391
You never come out
with me.

45:14.393 --> 45:15.626
You said one drink, so...

45:15.628 --> 45:16.661
And I totally
meant it.

45:16.663 --> 45:19.198
- Hi.
- Good evening, ladies.

45:20.299 --> 45:21.632
You don't need to...

45:21.634 --> 45:23.032
Not tonight.

45:23.034 --> 45:24.535
Cameron, come with me,
huh?

45:24.537 --> 45:25.968
We do the Arabian
tonight?

45:25.970 --> 45:28.072
Mmm. Perfect.

45:28.074 --> 45:28.972
Thank you.

45:28.974 --> 45:31.844
Rose Miller?
Rose Miller?

45:32.578 --> 45:34.146
I'm addressing you,
yes.

45:36.148 --> 45:37.981
<i>Mein Gott.</i>

45:37.983 --> 45:40.152
Look at you.
Who are you wearing?

45:41.921 --> 45:43.357
I'm actually wearing
one of my designs.

45:43.990 --> 45:44.956
Your design?

45:44.958 --> 45:46.457
Mm-hmm.

45:46.459 --> 45:48.327
Something new, I can see.

45:49.028 --> 45:50.260
I am impressed.

45:50.262 --> 45:51.629
Someone looks like

45:51.631 --> 45:54.334
she is well enough to
come back to work, huh?

45:55.101 --> 45:57.135
Actually, yes. I am.

45:57.137 --> 45:59.270
I could come back on Monday.

45:59.272 --> 46:00.638
I'd love to work on
the Shadenfreude Collection

46:00.640 --> 46:01.508
with you again.

46:02.409 --> 46:04.611
I would very much like that,
too, Rose.

46:06.246 --> 46:08.313
We launch in two months, huh?

46:08.315 --> 46:09.947
There's so much work to be done.

46:09.949 --> 46:11.917
I'm glad to see you
looking healthy.

46:12.319 --> 46:13.018
Thank you.

46:13.986 --> 46:16.187
Now, please. Don't let me down.

46:16.189 --> 46:17.956
I won't.

46:17.958 --> 46:19.557
And you, schnookie-flutz,

46:19.559 --> 46:21.159
remember you have
a photo shoot,

46:21.161 --> 46:22.563
9:00 a.m. tomorrow,
yeah?

46:23.196 --> 46:24.329
No drinking.

46:24.331 --> 46:25.132
I'll only have a few.

46:25.566 --> 46:27.233
No, no.
<i>Ein</i> drink, huh?

46:27.235 --> 46:29.035
Vodka and soda.
I don't want you getting fat.

46:30.538 --> 46:31.570
Let's go, dear.

46:31.572 --> 46:32.972
Who was that?

46:32.974 --> 46:34.205
She is stunning.

46:34.207 --> 46:35.708
Yeah. She's my assistant.

46:35.710 --> 46:36.709
Bubba,
where's the car?

46:36.711 --> 46:38.042
It's just up the street.

46:38.044 --> 46:39.177
I have to walk?

46:39.179 --> 46:40.046
Oh, my God.

46:40.947 --> 46:42.415
He practically begged you
to come back.

46:42.417 --> 46:43.649
Please. I hardly noticed.

46:43.651 --> 46:46.419
Shut up.
We're celebrating.

48:42.105 --> 48:44.505
Jesus, Dom, you're burning up.

48:44.507 --> 48:46.477
What the fuck are you on, hmm?

48:47.578 --> 48:49.446
It's always
so goddamn hot in here.

48:50.347 --> 48:52.214
Yeah.

48:52.216 --> 48:54.750
Can we get a little air in here,
for Christ's sakes?

48:54.752 --> 48:56.718
It's like a seniors' home.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.586
Someone, can we get
some air for Dom, please?

48:58.588 --> 48:59.855
Will someone get on that?

48:59.857 --> 49:02.425
Ice cubes or something?
Dom, you want ice cubes?

49:03.694 --> 49:04.860
You all right,
brother?

49:04.862 --> 49:06.193
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good.

49:06.195 --> 49:08.165
- You ready to hunt, brother?
- Yep.

49:10.901 --> 49:12.568
It's not brain surgery, Cindy.

49:12.570 --> 49:14.269
It's the same shit every week.

49:14.271 --> 49:16.238
You're being mean
to me.

49:16.240 --> 49:18.441
I can't concentrate when
you're being mean to me.

49:18.443 --> 49:20.577
Just try to fuck up on
your coverage. Not mine, okay?

49:20.579 --> 49:23.345
Guys? This is fucking real,
this connection.

49:23.347 --> 49:24.713
Let's do this. Let's do this.

49:24.715 --> 49:26.448
Let's see what happens.
Let's do this.

49:26.450 --> 49:27.716
Library quiet.
Like a fucking mouse.

49:27.718 --> 49:30.218
I love, I love, I love where
you guys have taken this scene.

49:30.220 --> 49:32.354
Let's get the energy
into this scene, right?

49:32.356 --> 49:33.590
Not pretty, okay?

49:33.592 --> 49:34.791
Yeah. Pretty.

49:34.793 --> 49:37.192
Yeah? You ready?
On your time? You ready?

49:37.194 --> 49:38.895
- Let's do this.
- You ready? Okay.

49:38.897 --> 49:42.133
We're rolling, guys. On your
time. Namaste. Let's do this.

49:45.469 --> 49:48.439
Ah. Action. Action.

49:52.844 --> 49:55.478
I can't keep lying
to my husband, Tony.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.847
It's never been
a problem before.

49:57.849 --> 49:59.351
Oh!

50:00.485 --> 50:02.653
Dominic... Ow!
You're hurting me.

50:02.655 --> 50:05.288
Dominic, you're hurting me! Ow.
Get off.

50:05.290 --> 50:06.557
Okay. Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Cut, cut, cut.

50:06.559 --> 50:07.591
For fuck's sakes.

50:07.593 --> 50:08.826
Try to act like
a fucking professional, okay?

50:08.828 --> 50:10.627
Hey, you know what? Don't talk
to me like that, all right?

50:10.629 --> 50:12.662
One sec. Cindy, one second.
Can I?

50:12.664 --> 50:13.796
Ralph?

50:13.798 --> 50:15.665
Yeah?

50:15.667 --> 50:18.401
I'm just here to bear witness
to your truth, brother.

50:18.403 --> 50:20.671
It's fucking awesome. Right?

50:20.673 --> 50:21.872
- Okay?
- Yeah.

50:21.874 --> 50:23.607
It's a bit weird in this scene.

50:23.609 --> 50:24.908
- Got it.
- So, let's bring

50:24.910 --> 50:26.310
- the intensity down.
- All right.

50:26.312 --> 50:27.311
Feel this fuckin'
wild animal beating?

50:27.313 --> 50:28.345
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:28.347 --> 50:29.446
Just let it be
a flower.

50:29.448 --> 50:30.447
Let it open up.

50:30.449 --> 50:31.515
A flower. Okay.

50:31.517 --> 50:32.951
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:32.953 --> 50:34.752
Cindy, you okay,
sweetheart? Ouch.

50:34.754 --> 50:36.486
- You all right?
- Yeah.

50:36.488 --> 50:37.921
Pain can be a gift.
Just fucking go with it.

50:37.923 --> 50:39.690
Don't throw it away.
Next time we'll get magic.

50:39.692 --> 50:40.891
- Okay.
- You ready to go?

50:40.893 --> 50:42.259
Yeah. Let's go.

50:42.261 --> 50:43.894
Yeah. I'm ready.

50:43.896 --> 50:45.729
Stop. Idea. Fuckin' idea.
Trent, Trent?

50:45.731 --> 50:46.730
We got Trent on set?
Trent?

50:46.732 --> 50:47.798
Right here.

50:47.800 --> 50:49.734
In the fucking scene.
Eat a piece of cherry pie.

50:49.736 --> 50:50.769
Trent? Who's Trent?

50:50.771 --> 50:51.803
Watch Cindy
the whole scene.

50:51.805 --> 50:53.303
What the fuck, right?

50:53.305 --> 50:54.007
Evening, y'all.

50:55.008 --> 50:56.974
Who's he?
Who the fuck is this?

50:56.976 --> 50:59.309
Trent Taylor.
I'm playing the new doctor.

50:59.311 --> 51:00.379
Doctor?

51:00.846 --> 51:02.379
How old is he?

51:02.381 --> 51:03.948
There's no new doctor
in my script.

51:03.950 --> 51:06.017
Just go. You're
a fucking artist. Work, man.

51:06.019 --> 51:08.720
Oh, really?

51:08.722 --> 51:10.455
Is something funny,
you little fuck?

51:10.457 --> 51:13.725
You piece of shit!
You fuck. Fuck!

51:13.727 --> 51:15.293
Fuck!

51:15.295 --> 51:17.395
- Ugh!
- No, man.

51:17.397 --> 51:18.496
It's good to
meet you.

51:18.498 --> 51:21.200
My mom is a big fan
of yours.

51:24.905 --> 51:26.305
Follow it!

52:54.363 --> 52:55.064
Ugh!

56:19.006 --> 56:20.706
Oh, my God.

56:22.943 --> 56:24.911
Fuck. What am I doing?

56:38.158 --> 56:39.525
Shit.

56:44.264 --> 56:45.663
Oh, shit.

56:48.902 --> 56:51.805
Chelsea? Please pick up.

56:54.608 --> 56:56.142
Please pick up.

57:18.766 --> 57:21.699
Okay. Please, sir.
I've calmed down now.

57:21.701 --> 57:23.335
Can I go back inside now?

57:23.337 --> 57:25.771
No.
Your night is done.

57:25.773 --> 57:27.706
Look.
I'm going to get you both fired.

57:27.708 --> 57:30.176
My friends are still inside,
all right?

57:30.178 --> 57:31.844
It doesn't matter.
You got to go home.

57:31.846 --> 57:34.381
Get your hands...
Get your hands off me?

57:34.383 --> 57:37.049
You're lucky I don't kick
both your asses, right now.

57:37.051 --> 57:38.653
Yeah. Take a number.

57:46.394 --> 57:48.294
What's up, beautiful?

57:48.296 --> 57:50.832
My name is Billy.
What's your name?

57:51.966 --> 57:54.635
Hey, excuse me.
What are you, a mute?

57:55.437 --> 57:57.871
What, you can't
fucking talk?

57:57.873 --> 57:59.341
Hey, I'm talking to you.

58:00.876 --> 58:03.143
You know, that's just
fucking typical.

58:03.145 --> 58:04.146
Bitch thinks
she's all that.

58:05.147 --> 58:06.847
You know, when someone
pays you a compliment,

58:06.849 --> 58:09.051
learn how to fuckin'
say thank you.

58:15.157 --> 58:17.424
Yeah, pretend like
you're on the phone.

58:17.426 --> 58:19.027
You fuckin' whore.

58:23.233 --> 58:25.168
Seriously, you ain't
all that, sweetheart.

58:27.103 --> 58:29.305
You're like
a New Jersey six.

58:30.406 --> 58:32.741
You don't got a man
as hot as I am.

58:45.922 --> 58:49.225
Jesus Christ, lady. You trying
to give me a heart attack?

58:52.762 --> 58:54.664
Looking good, though.

58:56.065 --> 58:57.831
Can you give me a ride?

58:57.833 --> 59:01.771
Oh, boy, can I.
Anywhere you want to go, toots.

59:02.138 --> 59:03.373
Get in.

59:10.079 --> 59:12.316
Okay, blondie.
What's your name?

59:12.916 --> 59:13.816
Rose.

59:14.318 --> 59:15.718
Rose?

59:17.087 --> 59:19.388
My name is Billy.

59:19.390 --> 59:22.759
So, where can I take you,
Rose?

59:24.994 --> 59:26.330
Nowhere.

59:29.233 --> 59:30.767
Nowhere, now?

59:38.876 --> 59:40.976
I knew you were
a dirty little slut

59:40.978 --> 59:42.079
the instant I... Ow!

59:45.549 --> 59:46.816
Too rough for you?

59:48.419 --> 59:50.387
Now you're really
going to get it.

59:55.560 --> 59:56.760
Ow.

59:58.363 --> 01:00:01.197
Try and stop me.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:07.205
Ugh!

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:11.208
Please!

01:00:34.332 --> 01:00:35.500
Excuse me?

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.813
Hello?

01:00:58.023 --> 01:00:59.124
Mr. Taylor?

01:01:04.096 --> 01:01:06.063
Mr. Taylor, what are you doing
out of bed?

01:01:06.065 --> 01:01:08.065
You just had
reconstructive surgery.

01:01:10.903 --> 01:01:14.138
Oh, you can't take
your bandages off just yet.

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.640
There's still going to be
a lot of swelling.

01:01:15.642 --> 01:01:17.141
What you're seeing
isn't indicative

01:01:17.143 --> 01:01:18.510
of what's going to be
the results.

01:01:18.512 --> 01:01:20.411
Come on.

01:02:16.336 --> 01:02:20.105
He bit me! He bit me!

01:02:27.648 --> 01:02:30.284
You did the right thing
coming to see me.

01:02:31.419 --> 01:02:33.619
Tell me more about
these meat cravings.

01:02:33.621 --> 01:02:36.089
It's not just the meat.
It's...

01:02:36.591 --> 01:02:38.624
It's the blood.

01:02:38.626 --> 01:02:40.128
There's something
about it.

01:02:42.163 --> 01:02:44.697
It's not uncommon
for patients

01:02:44.699 --> 01:02:47.233
to report changes
in taste post-surgery.

01:02:47.235 --> 01:02:48.936
It's a side effect
of the anesthesia.

01:02:50.639 --> 01:02:51.607
Things don't taste the same.

01:02:52.974 --> 01:02:55.244
We crave things
we've never eaten before.

01:02:56.011 --> 01:02:56.444
How's your appetite?

01:02:57.979 --> 01:03:01.447
I'm hungry all the time.
I can't keep anything down.

01:03:01.449 --> 01:03:05.119
I have these
severe stomach pains,

01:03:06.087 --> 01:03:08.089
and when
the pain is too much,

01:03:09.191 --> 01:03:10.990
that's when
the hallucinations start.

01:03:10.992 --> 01:03:12.494
And I see myself...

01:03:13.695 --> 01:03:14.430
<i>Please.</i>

01:03:15.164 --> 01:03:16.365
<i>Miss Miller?</i>

01:03:19.301 --> 01:03:20.401
I'm drinking blood.

01:03:21.102 --> 01:03:21.967
You're dreaming.

01:03:21.969 --> 01:03:24.373
I know it seems real,
but it isn't.

01:03:25.072 --> 01:03:25.574
Look.

01:03:27.008 --> 01:03:28.977
There isn't much that we know
about dreams.

01:03:29.711 --> 01:03:31.545
But one thing we do know is that

01:03:31.547 --> 01:03:34.116
it is the time
the mind takes to heal.

01:03:35.284 --> 01:03:37.085
Why am I dreaming about
drinking blood?

01:03:38.287 --> 01:03:39.654
Well, people who dream about
drinking blood

01:03:39.656 --> 01:03:42.123
often have
unfulfilled yearnings.

01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:43.626
It's tied to the guilt
of desire.

01:03:45.027 --> 01:03:47.027
I don't feel guilty.

01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:48.297
Are you in control
of the dreams,

01:03:49.231 --> 01:03:50.700
or do the dreams control you?

01:03:53.403 --> 01:03:56.104
Sometimes I am in control
of them.

01:03:58.141 --> 01:04:02.710
Sometimes it just seems like
I'm watching myself.

01:04:02.712 --> 01:04:05.482
Like, I'm me,

01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:08.051
but I'm somebody else.

01:04:11.521 --> 01:04:12.753
These nightmares...

01:04:12.755 --> 01:04:14.224
Hallucinations.

01:04:16.826 --> 01:04:20.127
It's making me feel like
I'm becoming a monster.

01:04:20.129 --> 01:04:22.499
Well,

01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:25.636
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

01:04:27.371 --> 01:04:29.338
but your monster
is psychological,

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.242
as most monsters are.

01:04:32.175 --> 01:04:34.275
It's your own creation.

01:04:34.277 --> 01:04:35.643
You don't recognize yourself
in the mirror,

01:04:35.645 --> 01:04:37.580
so you see this monster.

01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:42.751
When will this feeling
of dissociation go away?

01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:45.354
When will I start feeling
like myself again?

01:04:45.356 --> 01:04:46.524
Well, that's up to you,
Rose.

01:04:47.458 --> 01:04:48.624
We see
what we want to see,

01:04:48.626 --> 01:04:49.560
and some things,

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:51.262
we refuse to see.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:57.267
But we are the creators
of our own reality, Rose,

01:04:58.369 --> 01:05:00.804
and we are the editors
of them as well.

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:11.446
Excuse me, Miss Miller.

01:05:11.448 --> 01:05:13.650
Gunter,
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:05:13.652 --> 01:05:16.853
Late?
What have we here?

01:05:16.855 --> 01:05:18.223
That...

01:05:26.363 --> 01:05:27.732
Who did these drawings?

01:05:28.265 --> 01:05:29.099
You?

01:05:30.669 --> 01:05:31.168
Yes.

01:05:32.136 --> 01:05:33.136
They're not ready yet.

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.771
You can take some time
to look at them later.

01:05:34.773 --> 01:05:37.309
They seem ready to me.

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.613
I'm sorry.
Is this, um...

01:05:42.615 --> 01:05:43.881
Are you serious,
or is this Shadenfreude?

01:05:43.883 --> 01:05:45.314
Because I'm...

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:48.351
<i>Nein, nein.</i>

01:05:48.353 --> 01:05:49.754
This is Shadenfreude.

01:05:52.357 --> 01:05:54.292
My work is...

01:05:55.594 --> 01:05:58.294
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:58.296 --> 01:06:00.165
For my collection,

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:04.368
I want you to build
and design this one

01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:05.671
with me.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.606
Thank you.
That...

01:06:09.608 --> 01:06:10.810
Gunter,
that would be amazing.

01:06:11.811 --> 01:06:12.712
Thank you for
this opportunity.

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.479
I won't let you down.

01:06:15.481 --> 01:06:17.514
See, these designs,

01:06:17.516 --> 01:06:20.417
these are the essence
of my collection.

01:06:20.419 --> 01:06:23.155
The Dark Night
of the Soul, huh?

01:06:24.624 --> 01:06:27.794
What is the face
we show no one, hmm?

01:06:31.197 --> 01:06:33.231
Who are we when no one
is watching?

01:06:33.532 --> 01:06:35.366
Hmm?

01:06:35.368 --> 01:06:36.533
Dr. Riley?

01:06:36.535 --> 01:06:37.735
Yes?

01:06:37.737 --> 01:06:38.936
Dr. Beverly.
We spoke on the phone.

01:06:38.938 --> 01:06:40.371
Oh, of course.

01:06:40.373 --> 01:06:41.538
I really appreciate
the CDC coming

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:42.741
as quickly as you did for this.

01:06:42.743 --> 01:06:44.241
Ah, well, I only wish
we'd been made aware

01:06:44.243 --> 01:06:46.477
of the situation sooner.
Are you sure it's rabies?

01:06:46.479 --> 01:06:48.847
It was very difficult
to diagnose.

01:06:48.849 --> 01:06:51.883
It seems to be a mutated,
hyperactive strain,

01:06:51.885 --> 01:06:53.852
and it's extremely
aggressive.

01:06:53.854 --> 01:06:55.453
We have no idea
what started it.

01:06:55.455 --> 01:06:57.454
All we do have
is what we believe to be

01:06:57.456 --> 01:07:00.457
our first reported case,
Dominic Danvers.

01:07:00.459 --> 01:07:01.460
What's his
current condition?

01:07:02.461 --> 01:07:03.630
Not good.

01:07:27.021 --> 01:07:28.420
We need to find out
what bit him.

01:07:32.459 --> 01:07:33.795
Are you still
avoiding me?

01:07:34.996 --> 01:07:37.930
No. I've just been busy
dealing with

01:07:37.932 --> 01:07:39.465
a few little health concerns.

01:07:39.467 --> 01:07:40.802
Oh.

01:07:41.602 --> 01:07:43.003
You feeling okay?

01:07:43.005 --> 01:07:45.771
Yeah. No, I'm totally fine.

01:07:45.773 --> 01:07:47.641
I actually just got back
from the clinic.

01:07:48.341 --> 01:07:49.474
Burroughs?

01:07:49.476 --> 01:07:50.743
Mm-hmm.

01:07:50.745 --> 01:07:52.380
And he said?

01:07:53.614 --> 01:07:55.616
That I just have to give it
some more time.

01:07:56.451 --> 01:07:57.418
Oh.

01:07:59.021 --> 01:08:00.956
Did he say
anything else?

01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:02.925
That I should remember to eat.

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.662
Does that mean you'll let me
take you out for dinner?

01:08:08.596 --> 01:08:09.931
I walked into that one,
didn't I?

01:08:10.631 --> 01:08:12.400
Straight into it.

01:08:13.068 --> 01:08:15.601
So, how's your appetite?

01:08:15.603 --> 01:08:16.736
Uh, insatiable.

01:08:16.738 --> 01:08:18.272
I'm honestly hungry
all the time.

01:08:18.639 --> 01:08:20.372
The only thing I've been
able to keep down

01:08:20.374 --> 01:08:21.774
is the recovery
protein shakes

01:08:21.777 --> 01:08:22.975
from the clinic.

01:08:22.978 --> 01:08:24.644
Well, let's get you fed.
What looks good?

01:08:24.645 --> 01:08:27.647
Uh, actually,
I don't know.

01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:29.082
My stomach has been
kind of screwy

01:08:29.085 --> 01:08:30.617
since the surgery.

01:08:30.618 --> 01:08:32.785
Is that what you went to
the clinic about?

01:08:32.787 --> 01:08:33.587
Yeah.

01:08:34.421 --> 01:08:37.356
Yeah. That, and you know,

01:08:37.358 --> 01:08:39.761
I haven't been having
the greatest of nights.

01:08:40.962 --> 01:08:41.930
How do you mean?

01:08:43.365 --> 01:08:45.832
I've been having
these nightmares.

01:08:45.834 --> 01:08:47.367
It's stupid,
but I think it's

01:08:47.368 --> 01:08:49.005
because of the accident.

01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:53.609
You've been having nightmares?

01:08:55.478 --> 01:08:56.812
Yeah. I...

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:01.517
I feel like I'm awake
when I'm having them.

01:09:03.484 --> 01:09:05.354
They feel very real.

01:09:07.122 --> 01:09:08.825
Is that how it feels?

01:09:12.895 --> 01:09:15.095
Uh, no. I...

01:09:15.098 --> 01:09:16.831
Ignore me. I'm sorry.
I'm tired.

01:09:16.832 --> 01:09:19.934
I don't even know
what I'm saying.

01:09:19.935 --> 01:09:22.005
But thank you
for asking.

01:09:23.072 --> 01:09:24.874
You don't have to
feel sorry for me.

01:09:25.407 --> 01:09:26.509
I don't.

01:09:28.511 --> 01:09:29.845
I care about you, Rose.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.649
You do?

01:09:34.919 --> 01:09:35.920
Yeah.

01:09:38.388 --> 01:09:39.455
Can I, um,

01:09:40.157 --> 01:09:42.026
be honest
about something?

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.593
Oh, God. Okay.

01:09:45.595 --> 01:09:47.330
No. It's, uh...

01:09:48.165 --> 01:09:49.933
It's important.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.907
I'm sorry I...

01:09:58.909 --> 01:10:01.710
Shit.

01:10:01.712 --> 01:10:02.978
Oh, shit.

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.048
You okay?

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:06.715
Sorry. I think
I just bit my tongue.

01:10:06.717 --> 01:10:08.183
I'll be right back.

01:10:08.185 --> 01:10:09.519
Yeah.

01:10:29.941 --> 01:10:31.541
Rose?

01:10:31.543 --> 01:10:32.975
I'm sorry. I just...
I have... I have to go.

01:10:32.977 --> 01:10:35.144
What? Everything okay?
Something I said?

01:10:35.146 --> 01:10:36.845
Just... it's, um...
it's my stomach.

01:10:36.847 --> 01:10:38.547
I just really need
to go home. I'm sorry.

01:10:38.549 --> 01:10:39.883
Okay, well, I'll go with you.

01:10:39.885 --> 01:10:41.516
No, it's fine. Just stay
here and enjoy the food.

01:10:41.518 --> 01:10:42.451
No, I'll take you.

01:10:44.856 --> 01:10:47.190
Hey! Get away from her!

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.766
God!

01:11:08.613 --> 01:11:10.082
What the fuck?

01:11:12.885 --> 01:11:14.120
Rose?!

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:18.989
Rose!

01:11:18.991 --> 01:11:20.091
Jesus!

01:11:21.559 --> 01:11:23.162
See, the virus compromises
the nervous system,

01:11:24.529 --> 01:11:26.496
causing the brain
to misfire its signals,

01:11:26.498 --> 01:11:28.167
effectively driving
the victim insane.

01:11:29.902 --> 01:11:32.603
It puts them in a rage, causing
violent and erratic behavior.

01:11:32.605 --> 01:11:34.507
It makes them a danger
to themselves and to others.

01:11:35.574 --> 01:11:37.275
What can we do?
I mean, poor Dana.

01:11:37.277 --> 01:11:38.376
No, this isn't
Dana anymore.

01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:40.744
We have to vaccinate anyone
without an advanced case

01:11:40.746 --> 01:11:42.082
and isolate those
showing symptoms.

01:11:42.748 --> 01:11:43.116
Jesus Christ.

01:11:44.516 --> 01:11:46.150
We've seen some showing
incubation periods

01:11:46.152 --> 01:11:48.220
as little as
48 hours already.

01:11:49.021 --> 01:11:50.754
How is that possible?

01:11:50.756 --> 01:11:52.623
Unknown.

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:54.058
But with a mutant strain

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.759
that can incubate
in less than 48 hours,

01:11:55.761 --> 01:11:57.528
we could be
looking at an epidemic

01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:59.465
unlike anything
the world has ever seen.

01:12:00.834 --> 01:12:02.468
What about the infected
showing symptoms?

01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:05.839
I say we keep them comfortable,
until they terminate.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.672
But we also need to
keep them out of view.

01:12:08.674 --> 01:12:11.811
We do not want to cause
mass hysteria.

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.712
This little one,

01:12:14.714 --> 01:12:16.647
he's got a lot of painful
procedures ahead of him.

01:12:16.649 --> 01:12:18.316
But at least he's
not going to have rabies.

01:12:18.318 --> 01:12:20.251
It spreads like an STD,

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:23.021
but for this many people
to have contracted the virus

01:12:23.023 --> 01:12:25.857
and not have a common
connection is impossible.

01:12:25.859 --> 01:12:27.993
Something is connecting and
linking these people together.

01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:29.661
You think it's
an infected human.

01:12:29.663 --> 01:12:32.097
No, I don't think it's human.
But what I do believe is

01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:34.899
that something has come in close
contact with a lot of people,

01:12:34.901 --> 01:12:36.568
and if we don't stop it,

01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:38.169
it's going to come in close
contact with a lot more.

01:12:38.171 --> 01:12:39.904
We're issuing a public
health warning.

01:12:39.906 --> 01:12:41.673
No, no, no. Listen to me.

01:12:41.675 --> 01:12:43.742
If this gets on the news,
it's going to cause a panic.

01:12:43.744 --> 01:12:46.278
What we need to do is quarantine
all of the infected people

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.980
before it gets out of the city.

01:12:47.982 --> 01:12:51.350
Rabies is one of the deadliest
viruses known to man,

01:12:51.352 --> 01:12:53.652
and with a mutated
strain like this,

01:12:53.654 --> 01:12:55.655
if we do not stop it,
it could infect all of mankind.

01:12:56.156 --> 01:12:58.290
So, what we need
to do is get an autopsy

01:12:58.292 --> 01:13:00.894
on Dominic Danvers before it's
too late, we need to...

01:13:01.762 --> 01:13:02.296
Jesus Christ.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.802
Hey! Lower your weapons!

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:10.705
This man was sick!

01:13:12.006 --> 01:13:14.307
He came to the hospital
because he needed help!

01:13:23.351 --> 01:13:24.318
Miss...

01:13:29.624 --> 01:13:31.291
Miss, are you okay?

01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:34.294
Easy, easy.

01:13:34.296 --> 01:13:36.229
You know, you really shouldn't
be out here

01:13:36.231 --> 01:13:37.631
by yourself this time of night.

01:13:38.767 --> 01:13:41.904
Are you okay?
Miss, can I help you?

01:13:43.005 --> 01:13:44.937
Just please... whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:44.939 --> 01:13:46.672
You don't want to
go in there.

01:13:46.674 --> 01:13:49.809
It's okay. It's okay.

01:13:51.712 --> 01:13:54.247
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:14:47.203 --> 01:14:48.903
<i>Hello, this is Burroughs.</i>

01:14:48.905 --> 01:14:50.339
<i>Please leave a detailed message</i>

01:14:50.341 --> 01:14:53.375
<i>as well as a number that you
may be reached at. Thank you.</i>

01:14:53.377 --> 01:14:55.977
<i>If this an emergency,
please call my associate</i>

01:14:55.979 --> 01:14:59.280
<i>Dr. Elliot on the main
directory at extension four.</i>

01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:02.018
<i>Dr. Burroughs, it's Rose.</i>

01:15:03.019 --> 01:15:05.922
<i>I've been having
vivid nightmares</i>

01:15:07.091 --> 01:15:08.392
<i>and stomach pains.</i>

01:15:19.136 --> 01:15:21.336
<i>Maybe I should be taking
more of something,</i>

01:15:21.338 --> 01:15:24.275
<i>or, I don't know,
less of something.</i>

01:15:25.242 --> 01:15:26.709
<i>Uh, please call me.</i>

01:15:28.279 --> 01:15:31.715
Life begats life.

01:15:32.316 --> 01:15:34.183
Energy creates energy.

01:15:34.185 --> 01:15:36.051
It is only through
spending oneself

01:15:36.053 --> 01:15:37.087
that one becomes rich.

01:15:38.256 --> 01:15:40.223
Now, you must push
yourselves completely,

01:15:40.225 --> 01:15:42.258
until there is nothing left.

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.094
Nothing. Hmm?

01:15:44.428 --> 01:15:47.497
Now, I do not mean
to die for fashion,

01:15:47.499 --> 01:15:50.400
but this fashion
is to die for, yeah?

01:15:50.402 --> 01:15:52.801
This is fantasy, hmm?

01:15:52.803 --> 01:15:55.340
This woman is too
beautiful to exist.

01:15:56.274 --> 01:15:59.244
Our fashion
is not everyone.

01:16:00.946 --> 01:16:02.445
What's up with you and Brad?

01:16:02.447 --> 01:16:03.780
Nothing.

01:16:03.782 --> 01:16:06.082
We, uh... we went
on a date last night

01:16:06.084 --> 01:16:07.952
and I had an upset stomach,
so I had to leave.

01:16:08.553 --> 01:16:10.754
You went on a date with Brad
and you didn't even tell me?

01:16:11.789 --> 01:16:13.458
What else are you
hiding from me?

01:16:16.294 --> 01:16:17.794
Okay.

01:16:17.796 --> 01:16:19.465
He's coming over.
Do you want me to stay?

01:16:19.864 --> 01:16:21.931
No, it's fine. Thanks.

01:16:21.933 --> 01:16:23.034
Hey.

01:16:24.303 --> 01:16:26.138
We need to talk about
what happened last night.

01:16:27.473 --> 01:16:30.207
Look, this medication
that I'm on, it's...

01:16:30.209 --> 01:16:32.043
It's making me a
little messed up, okay?

01:16:32.944 --> 01:16:34.377
To be honest with you,

01:16:34.379 --> 01:16:36.079
all I remember is
leaving the restaurant.

01:16:36.081 --> 01:16:37.282
I'm not sure how I got home.

01:16:38.917 --> 01:16:40.219
I took you.

01:16:41.052 --> 01:16:42.086
Rose?

01:16:42.088 --> 01:16:42.819
Thank you.

01:16:42.821 --> 01:16:44.290
I am waiting on you.

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:49.295
Chelsea, please.

01:16:50.863 --> 01:16:54.301
All right, Rose,
what do you see? Hmm?

01:16:55.434 --> 01:16:56.835
It's...

01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:58.037
It's good.

01:16:58.937 --> 01:17:03.009
It's good, but...
But what?

01:17:03.342 --> 01:17:04.810
Show me.

01:18:03.571 --> 01:18:07.175
Couture. Yeah.

01:18:09.343 --> 01:18:12.112
Chelsea, would you give
us one more turn, please?

01:18:19.287 --> 01:18:20.154
Yeah.

01:18:24.258 --> 01:18:26.194
All the models,
please, line up.

01:18:27.596 --> 01:18:30.299
<i>Schnell. Raus.</i>
Move, move, move.

01:18:30.965 --> 01:18:32.133
All right.

01:18:39.073 --> 01:18:42.110
This dress
will close the show...

01:18:43.111 --> 01:18:43.479
on Chelsea.

01:18:44.546 --> 01:18:46.448
Close the show?
You mean me?

01:18:47.081 --> 01:18:48.482
I mean, us.

01:18:48.484 --> 01:18:50.652
Very impressive work, Rose.
Hmm?

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.186
If you keep impressing me,

01:18:53.188 --> 01:18:55.590
your own line is not
out of the question. Hmm?

01:18:57.626 --> 01:18:58.958
Well done.

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.259
Thank you.

01:19:00.261 --> 01:19:01.628
All right, schnookie-flutzes,

01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:03.697
...let's go. Out, out, out.

01:19:03.699 --> 01:19:05.534
We have work to do.

01:19:11.006 --> 01:19:12.038
<i>A warning</i>

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.074
<i>from the Center
of Disease Control</i>

01:19:14.076 --> 01:19:17.077
<i>declaring an emergency
alert situation.</i>

01:19:17.079 --> 01:19:19.379
<i>An outbreak of rabies

01:19:19.381 --> 01:19:21.715
<i>those experiencing

<i>of flu-like symptoms</i>

<i>Residents are strongly

01:19:35.432 --> 01:19:37.532
<i>We pray it doesn't

01:19:39.202 --> 01:19:40.268
Gunter.

01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:41.671
Ah, Stella, hello, hi.

01:19:43.173 --> 01:19:45.673
Now, what do you tell the
critics that are saying

01:19:45.675 --> 01:19:47.508
that you premiering
your collection

01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:52.045
during a public health crisis
is a tasteless publicity stunt?

01:19:52.047 --> 01:19:55.149
Fashion never stops
for anybody or anything.

01:19:55.151 --> 01:19:57.118
You know this Stella, hmm?

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.688
And we have faced public
health crises before.

01:19:59.690 --> 01:20:02.758
I have lost many friends
to AIDS and SARS.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.394
And, you know,
what is this, really?

01:20:05.396 --> 01:20:07.028
It's a fucking head cold.

01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:08.796
It's nonsense.

01:20:08.798 --> 01:20:12.200
We are talking about fashion.
It's not <i>Dateline.</i>

01:20:12.202 --> 01:20:13.634
- Okay.
- Get a job on cable.

01:20:13.636 --> 01:20:14.803
Gunter, stop talking.

01:20:14.805 --> 01:20:16.237
Do you like the blue?

01:20:16.239 --> 01:20:17.675
- It's genius.
- Yeah, I thought it was good.

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.287
Excuse me.

01:20:31.488 --> 01:20:34.222
Hi. Um, have you seen
Chelsea arrive yet?

01:20:34.224 --> 01:20:35.426
I can't find her.

01:20:36.059 --> 01:20:36.727
Who?

01:20:38.496 --> 01:20:39.428
Never mind.

01:20:48.807 --> 01:20:49.939
Hello.

01:20:49.941 --> 01:20:52.209
<i>Rose. Dr. Burroughs.
I saw that you called.</i>

01:20:53.478 --> 01:20:55.479
Listen, I was just
going over your test results

01:20:56.447 --> 01:20:58.113
from the last time you were in.

01:20:58.115 --> 01:21:00.449
I think you'd better
come back into the clinic

01:21:00.451 --> 01:21:01.683
for an extended stay.

01:21:01.685 --> 01:21:03.285
<i>It's nothing serious,</i>

01:21:03.287 --> 01:21:05.855
<i>but just to err
on the side of caution.</i>

01:21:05.857 --> 01:21:07.089
<i>Can you come in tonight?</i>

01:21:07.091 --> 01:21:08.225
Um...

01:21:09.394 --> 01:21:11.162
I can't tonight,
but I could come tomorrow.

01:21:12.531 --> 01:21:15.166
Oh. Well, I suppose that'll
have to be soon enough.

01:21:16.167 --> 01:21:19.569
But...
try not to push yourself.

01:21:19.571 --> 01:21:21.138
<i>I won't. Thank you.</i>

01:21:26.745 --> 01:21:28.747
Shit.

01:21:39.725 --> 01:21:41.258
Oh, my...

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.495
Chels, what happened?

01:21:44.462 --> 01:21:45.662
I had a hard time getting here.

01:21:45.664 --> 01:21:48.431
Like, I fucking hate this
country sometimes,

01:21:48.433 --> 01:21:49.599
you know what I mean?

01:21:49.601 --> 01:21:51.134
Are you okay?

01:21:51.136 --> 01:21:52.903
What the fuck
happened to your hand?

01:21:52.905 --> 01:21:55.439
Traffic was gridlocked,
so I had to take the subway,

01:21:55.441 --> 01:21:57.274
and there's was this
lady and she just...

01:21:57.276 --> 01:21:59.643
she went insane
and she fucking bit me,

01:21:59.645 --> 01:22:02.179
and then, she was
shot by the police.

01:22:02.181 --> 01:22:03.848
You look fucked up.

01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:06.150
You sure you're
okay to walk tonight?

01:22:06.152 --> 01:22:09.620
Yeah, fine. I just... I didn't
know it would be this hard.

01:22:09.622 --> 01:22:12.423
What's hard, sweetheart?
Being beautiful?

01:22:12.425 --> 01:22:13.757
Closing the show?

01:22:13.759 --> 01:22:15.394
Give me your problems.

01:22:24.605 --> 01:22:26.773
Oh my God, Chelsea.

01:22:31.544 --> 01:22:32.778
Fuck...

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:36.347
She looks like she
just came from a bukkake,

01:22:36.349 --> 01:22:39.118
but I'm convinced
that's her look.

01:22:41.688 --> 01:22:43.521
Do some more coke, Michelle.

01:22:43.523 --> 01:22:46.326
It's doing wonders for that
already glowing personality.

01:22:47.294 --> 01:22:48.493
Stay still.

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.712
<i>Hi, it's Chelsea.</i>

01:23:07.714 --> 01:23:11.817
<i>I'm too busy to answer
this, obviously. Bye.</i>

01:23:11.819 --> 01:23:13.220
Chels, where...

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:15.790
shit.

01:24:04.473 --> 01:24:05.841
Did you hear that?

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:09.442
Oh, sh...

01:24:12.513 --> 01:24:14.883
What the fuck is wrong
with that bitch, man?

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:19.220
Fuckin' help me.

01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:29.697
What the fuck
is going on? Oh, shit.

01:24:29.699 --> 01:24:30.999
- Fuck...
- Buddy...

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:35.771
Stop, stop.

01:26:06.031 --> 01:26:08.465
Rose, what are
you doing up?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.700
What do you mean?
What happened?

01:26:11.702 --> 01:26:13.938
You passed out in the alley.
You don't remember?

01:26:14.605 --> 01:26:15.370
No.

01:26:15.372 --> 01:26:16.940
We need to get you
out of here.

01:26:16.942 --> 01:26:19.976
No, no. I'm fine.
Oh, God...

01:26:19.978 --> 01:26:22.512
I've just been under
a lot of pressure lately.

01:26:22.514 --> 01:26:24.581
I... Yeah,
I just need to eat something.

01:26:24.583 --> 01:26:27.183
Okay, fine, let's get you fed,
a proper meal,

01:26:27.185 --> 01:26:29.786
but not here.
I'm taking you to the clinic.

01:26:29.788 --> 01:26:31.854
No, no! I already have an
appointment tomorrow.

01:26:31.856 --> 01:26:33.056
It can wait.

01:26:33.058 --> 01:26:35.124
Rose, Rose.
Rose, it can't wait.

01:26:35.126 --> 01:26:37.560
I need to see my dress
close the show.

01:26:37.562 --> 01:26:39.929
You know how much I've
sacrificed for this?

01:26:39.931 --> 01:26:42.133
I am not going to miss this.

01:26:43.101 --> 01:26:44.434
I'm not leaving.

01:26:44.436 --> 01:26:46.004
Rose...
Rose!

01:26:48.908 --> 01:26:49.842
Fuck.

01:27:00.619 --> 01:27:01.386
Whoa.

01:27:01.853 --> 01:27:02.721
I know, right?

01:27:03.855 --> 01:27:05.823
It's the best dress in
the whole fucking collection.

01:27:05.825 --> 01:27:07.124
Hey, where were you?

01:27:07.126 --> 01:27:08.659
You all right?

01:27:08.661 --> 01:27:10.661
It doesn't matter.
I'm here now.

01:27:10.663 --> 01:27:12.796
Do you remember how much
we used to dream of this?

01:27:12.798 --> 01:27:15.701
Me closing the show
in one of your designs?

01:27:16.636 --> 01:27:19.069
Here we are.
We made it.

01:27:19.071 --> 01:27:20.603
How's it feel?

01:27:20.605 --> 01:27:24.942
It doesn't feel real,
none of it does.

01:27:24.944 --> 01:27:28.112
<i>The show will
be starting in one minute.</i>

01:27:28.114 --> 01:27:29.880
Are you sure you're all right?

01:27:29.882 --> 01:27:32.016
How couldn't I be?

01:27:32.018 --> 01:27:34.119
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

01:27:34.121 --> 01:27:36.722
Do you know how many girls
would kill to be where we are?

01:27:37.757 --> 01:27:39.658
It's gonna be your
line next, Rose.

01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:41.728
You're gonna be great.

01:27:42.795 --> 01:27:44.628
You're gonna be great.

01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:47.131
I'm closing
the motherfuckin' show.

01:27:47.133 --> 01:27:49.733
I am great. Go.

01:27:49.735 --> 01:27:51.202
You don't want
to miss your big moment.

01:27:51.204 --> 01:27:52.603
I just wanted to tell you...

01:27:52.605 --> 01:27:53.939
Rose,
Gunter's asking for you.

01:27:53.941 --> 01:27:56.540
Oh my God, Chelsea,
you're so sweaty.

01:27:56.542 --> 01:27:58.677
God, Chelsea,
this way, come on.

01:29:32.374 --> 01:29:33.907
We need to leave now.

01:29:33.909 --> 01:29:34.777
What?

01:29:35.711 --> 01:29:36.610
I know what's going on.

01:29:36.612 --> 01:29:38.312
I know you're not
feeling well. Come on.

01:29:38.314 --> 01:29:39.713
- No, I'm fine.
- Rose...

01:29:39.715 --> 01:29:41.082
Nothing's going on.
I told you that.

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:42.216
We don't have any more time.

01:29:43.952 --> 01:29:46.652
Did you hear that?
Is that a part of the show?

01:29:50.993 --> 01:29:52.159
Oh my God! Chelsea!

01:29:55.798 --> 01:29:56.899
No!

01:29:57.933 --> 01:29:59.169
Chelsea!

01:30:02.072 --> 01:30:02.939
Chelsea!

01:30:04.641 --> 01:30:05.742
Chels, no!

01:30:07.076 --> 01:30:09.042
Have you lost your mind?!

01:30:10.012 --> 01:30:10.979
Chelsea!

01:30:11.713 --> 01:30:13.147
Chelsea!

01:30:18.021 --> 01:30:19.320
Stop!

01:30:25.095 --> 01:30:26.328
Police! Don't move!

01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:28.163
- We got to get out of here now!
- Chelsea!

01:30:29.766 --> 01:30:30.866
Chelsea!

01:30:32.869 --> 01:30:33.770
Don't move!

01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:47.952
Chels, no!

01:30:50.921 --> 01:30:51.922
Chelsea!

01:30:53.023 --> 01:30:54.358
Freeze!

01:31:01.999 --> 01:31:03.167
No!

01:31:06.403 --> 01:31:07.803
Rose, come on.

01:31:07.805 --> 01:31:09.171
- No!
- We gotta get the hell out!

01:31:09.173 --> 01:31:10.739
- No!
- Come on!

01:31:10.741 --> 01:31:11.974
Let's go.

01:31:18.848 --> 01:31:19.948
You're okay.

01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:21.717
Rose, I heard you fainted

01:31:21.719 --> 01:31:23.352
and the hallucinations
have become more persistent.

01:31:23.354 --> 01:31:24.889
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

01:31:25.322 --> 01:31:26.822
I brought her in
as soon as I could.

01:31:26.824 --> 01:31:29.225
Oh God. Chelsea, I should...

01:31:29.227 --> 01:31:29.992
It's okay.

01:31:29.994 --> 01:31:31.461
You did the right
thing, Mr. Hart.

01:31:31.463 --> 01:31:33.496
Rose, I'm so terribly
sorry for the stress

01:31:33.498 --> 01:31:35.098
you've suffered
outside this facility.

01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:36.366
It was not my intention
to rush things.

01:31:36.368 --> 01:31:37.600
Things have gotten
way out of hand outside.

01:31:37.602 --> 01:31:39.804
Believe when I tell you that
I have everything under control.

01:31:40.805 --> 01:31:42.272
Oh God.
Dr. Burroughs, I'm sick.

01:31:42.274 --> 01:31:43.506
Okay.

01:31:43.508 --> 01:31:45.107
That virus on the news,

01:31:45.109 --> 01:31:47.412
I feel like...
I feel like it came from me.

01:31:48.746 --> 01:31:50.246
Things have been
happening around me.

01:31:50.248 --> 01:31:53.084
It's not a dream.
It's... it's my fault.

01:31:54.152 --> 01:31:56.087
I hurt people
and Chelsea's dead.

01:31:57.155 --> 01:31:59.356
Oh God, the way
she looked at me...

01:31:59.358 --> 01:32:00.924
Calm yourself, Rose.
Calm yourself!

01:32:00.926 --> 01:32:01.460
She looked at me!

01:32:02.127 --> 01:32:03.360
Calm yourself.

01:32:03.362 --> 01:32:04.894
Have you been
taking your formula?

01:32:04.896 --> 01:32:06.263
No.

01:32:06.265 --> 01:32:08.131
Oh, no. Come on.

01:32:08.133 --> 01:32:11.000
It's all like blood,

01:32:11.002 --> 01:32:12.938
that's why I stopped taking it.

01:32:14.172 --> 01:32:17.075
Was it blood?
Why would you give me blood?

01:32:18.777 --> 01:32:21.212
Look, I know I sound crazy, but
these aren't hallucinations.

01:32:21.214 --> 01:32:23.147
Something is very wrong with me.

01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:25.082
Blood? These hallucinations
are very persistent.

01:32:25.084 --> 01:32:27.384
I think it's time to
come clean with us, Doctor.

01:32:27.386 --> 01:32:30.254
All those people are dead
or sick because of me.

01:32:30.256 --> 01:32:32.789
Rose, Rose, Rose,
what if I were to tell you

01:32:32.791 --> 01:32:34.791
that there was a sickness?

01:32:34.793 --> 01:32:37.294
And it is going to kill
100,000 people today,

01:32:37.296 --> 01:32:40.364
and it is going to kill
100,000 people every day

01:32:40.366 --> 01:32:42.032
until we cure it?

01:32:42.034 --> 01:32:44.969
It doesn't matter your
level of health. You could...

01:32:44.971 --> 01:32:47.238
it will kill an adult
in the prime of life

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:49.307
as easily as
a new-born or a senior.

01:32:49.309 --> 01:32:51.343
It is completely
random and ruthless.

01:32:51.345 --> 01:32:53.545
Now, Rose, if you
could save those people,

01:32:53.547 --> 01:32:55.448
if you could stop that,
would you do it?

01:32:56.148 --> 01:32:57.581
Of course.

01:32:57.583 --> 01:32:59.085
Well, that sickness
is already here, Rose.

01:33:00.353 --> 01:33:02.321
It is already with us
and it is called death.

01:33:03.923 --> 01:33:06.859
We have the means to cure it,
but our hands are tied.

01:33:10.931 --> 01:33:13.000
It's just right through there.

01:33:44.931 --> 01:33:45.930
What the hell is this?

01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:51.637
We have to get out of here.

01:33:51.639 --> 01:33:53.038
We should fill Rose in,

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.573
shouldn't we, Mr. Hart?

01:33:54.575 --> 01:33:56.976
Time to "come clean",
as you put it.

01:33:56.978 --> 01:33:57.910
No, let me explain!

01:33:57.912 --> 01:33:58.911
I hired Mr. Hart

01:33:58.913 --> 01:34:01.482
to keep an eye on you
outside the facility.

01:34:02.651 --> 01:34:04.283
What?

01:34:04.285 --> 01:34:06.619
He was a perfect
candidate for the position.

01:34:06.621 --> 01:34:09.322
He already had
easy access to you,

01:34:09.324 --> 01:34:10.989
and when I told
him what you were, well,

01:34:10.991 --> 01:34:14.195
he's a journalist;
he couldn't resist a story.

01:34:16.464 --> 01:34:17.565
What am I?

01:34:18.166 --> 01:34:19.298
Rose, it...

01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:21.302
- You knew this whole time?
- No.

01:34:22.136 --> 01:34:23.570
I was keeping you safe.

01:34:23.572 --> 01:34:25.137
By what? Spying on me?

01:34:25.139 --> 01:34:26.440
Like I'm some sort
of science experiment?

01:34:26.442 --> 01:34:27.474
No! No, it's not like that.

01:34:27.476 --> 01:34:28.608
Then how is it?

01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:31.010
I was trying to protect you.

01:34:31.012 --> 01:34:32.013
He asked me to!

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:34.415
But I never
asked you to, did I?

01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:37.116
- I had no say.
- I know.

01:34:37.118 --> 01:34:38.318
I fucked up.

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.086
Yeah, you're right.

01:34:40.088 --> 01:34:41.557
I did. I did.

01:34:43.225 --> 01:34:45.494
Rose, hey...

01:34:47.363 --> 01:34:48.696
I love you.

01:34:48.698 --> 01:34:50.032
I don't believe you!

01:34:51.967 --> 01:34:54.436
So much for your journalistic
integrity, Mr. Hart.

01:34:57.038 --> 01:34:58.906
Burroughs, you son of a bitch!

01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:10.620
What the fuck is this? Huh?

01:35:11.621 --> 01:35:13.086
Is this blood?!

01:35:13.088 --> 01:35:15.456
Your mind will
answer most questions

01:35:15.458 --> 01:35:17.091
if you learn to relax

01:35:17.093 --> 01:35:18.291
and wait for the answer.

01:35:19.995 --> 01:35:21.194
What the hell does that mean?!

01:35:21.196 --> 01:35:22.264
Read a book.

01:35:27.035 --> 01:35:29.506
Your new body is only
limited by its need for blood.

01:35:31.074 --> 01:35:32.909
You must feed, Rose.

01:35:33.743 --> 01:35:35.044
Stop denying yourself.

01:35:36.379 --> 01:35:38.513
At some level, you must have
known that these weren't

01:35:38.515 --> 01:35:39.382
hallucinations or nightmares.

01:35:40.451 --> 01:35:42.252
There is a predator
in you, Rose,

01:35:43.253 --> 01:35:45.119
and it is longing
to be let out.

01:35:45.121 --> 01:35:47.422
What have you done to me?

01:35:47.424 --> 01:35:48.756
I have simply
allowed you to reach

01:35:48.758 --> 01:35:50.994
your greatest
untapped potential...

01:35:52.228 --> 01:35:53.163
for the betterment of humanity.

01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:55.699
You took away my humanity!

01:35:56.767 --> 01:35:59.167
An outdated
and overrated concept.

01:35:59.169 --> 01:36:02.304
The human is limited.
You're so much more now, Rose.

01:36:04.108 --> 01:36:08.075
Yes, I know
the price is high,

01:36:08.077 --> 01:36:09.546
but the cost of all
life is death.

01:36:10.648 --> 01:36:13.214
Your body kills cells
to sustain life.

01:36:13.216 --> 01:36:17.619
Human beings consumed over 56
billion farm animals last year.

01:36:19.323 --> 01:36:20.456
What you do to
achieve immortality

01:36:20.458 --> 01:36:21.225
isn't all that different.

01:36:22.526 --> 01:36:25.062
And the sacrifice of a few
individuals is worth it.

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:27.597
It's justified

01:36:27.599 --> 01:36:29.799
to ensure the survival
of the species.

01:36:29.801 --> 01:36:33.002
You have no right to play God.

01:36:33.637 --> 01:36:37.374
What God?
We are God.

01:36:40.411 --> 01:36:42.480
Ahh! What the fuck?!

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:44.516
Holy shit.

01:36:45.584 --> 01:36:47.452
What the hell is that thing?

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.594
When we reached the limits
of what could be done

01:36:57.596 --> 01:36:58.630
for my wife's cancer,

01:36:59.698 --> 01:37:01.764
she donated
her body to the cause.

01:37:04.369 --> 01:37:06.771
And now, she represents the
breakthrough in my research.

01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:14.678
This?
This is your wife?!

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:15.411
The early part

01:37:15.413 --> 01:37:17.848
of the procedure
saved her flesh,

01:37:17.850 --> 01:37:20.519
but then, the cancer
itself became immortal,

01:37:22.687 --> 01:37:26.625
mutating the human shell
into something... unique.

01:37:28.159 --> 01:37:30.395
I don't expect you to
understand the beauty of it.

01:37:31.631 --> 01:37:34.498
I was limiting myself
with the restrictions

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:36.200
of a human-based
value system.

01:37:36.202 --> 01:37:38.469
Our humanity,
as you put it, Rose,

01:37:38.471 --> 01:37:40.373
imposes such constraint.

01:37:41.808 --> 01:37:43.841
Cynthia was the first of
many I was able to save

01:37:43.843 --> 01:37:46.677
when I freed myself of such
narrow-minded concepts

01:37:46.679 --> 01:37:48.412
as humanity.

01:38:00.827 --> 01:38:01.893
Rose!

01:38:03.897 --> 01:38:05.630
Don't injure yourself!

01:38:09.635 --> 01:38:10.169
No!

01:38:16.542 --> 01:38:17.611
Feed, Rose.

01:38:19.345 --> 01:38:21.613
Don't let his sacrifice
be in vain.

01:38:26.253 --> 01:38:28.188
Keep him as part of yourself.

01:38:47.274 --> 01:38:48.406
Cynthia!

01:38:49.711 --> 01:38:51.877
You get the fuck
away from my wife!

01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:40.396
No!

01:39:59.948 --> 01:40:01.281
<i>Though there have been</i>

01:40:01.283 --> 01:40:04.451
<i>reports of excessive force
being called into effect,</i>

01:40:04.453 --> 01:40:06.454
<i>the military has contained
the rabies outbreak.</i>

01:40:07.388 --> 01:40:09.523
<i>With vaccinations ineffective,</i>

01:40:09.525 --> 01:40:11.960
<i>all patients exhibiting the
virus have been euthanized.</i>

01:40:13.362 --> 01:40:14.930
<i>The CDC has lifted
the public emergency</i>

01:40:15.731 --> 01:40:17.866
<i>that seems to have left as
suddenly as it started,</i>

01:40:19.535 --> 01:40:21.903
<i>and with health officials
still scratching their heads</i>

01:40:21.905 --> 01:40:24.806
<i>and wondering
what was the cause.</i>

01:40:24.808 --> 01:40:27.274
<i>What was reported as an
outbreak of rabies</i>

01:40:27.276 --> 01:40:28.478
<i>has been now
confirmed by officials</i>

01:40:29.412 --> 01:40:30.713
<i>as a violent strain of the flu</i>

01:40:31.847 --> 01:40:35.348
<i>and the result of
online hysteria.</i>

01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:36.851
<i>It looks like you can
go back to trusting</i>

01:40:36.853 --> 01:40:38.418
<i>the neighbor next-door,</i>

01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:40.054
<i>though many
still remain missing.</i>

01:40:58.808 --> 01:41:01.542
No, this isn't for you.

01:41:01.544 --> 01:41:03.644
No, you had yours.

01:41:08.085 --> 01:41:09.818
No, no, no.

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:13.724
This isn't for you.
This is for our guest. Yes.

01:41:47.758 --> 01:41:48.993
Good morning.

01:41:59.805 --> 01:42:00.972
No.

01:42:14.152 --> 01:42:19.825
Yes, essential immortality is
very expensive, isn't it, dear?

01:42:41.446 --> 01:42:44.984
Now, where were we?

01:42:57.731 --> 01:43:01.464
