when a plan comes together.

39:31.462 --> 39:35.709
Vanman to Vetwoman.
We're about 5 miles from base.

39:35.800 --> 39:39.251
What if they've really been caught this time
and can't meet us?

39:39.345 --> 39:42.382
Then l believe l'll have
a traumatic experience.

39:56.905 --> 40:01.068
Ever notice you run into
the nicest people in tanks?

40:05.288 --> 40:07.281
What are you so worried about?

40:10.126 --> 40:12.878
When he gets there, we cancel his warranty.

40:12.962 --> 40:15.797
Nobody knows who's got the guns.
lt's simple.

40:15.882 --> 40:18.254
Yeah, sure, simple. Fine.

40:19.177 --> 40:22.877
Only, you're making a mistake if you think
he's going to show up here alone.

40:22.972 --> 40:24.764
He ain't that stupid.

40:25.016 --> 40:27.554
So? Got a suggestion?

40:27.644 --> 40:29.850
We make like the shadows at high noon.

40:29.938 --> 40:32.892
We take the stuff and we vanish.

40:38.780 --> 40:41.152
Sure hope Charlotte will be all right.

40:41.449 --> 40:44.948
l wasn't crazy about dropping her
and Harnett on the road back there.

40:45.036 --> 40:48.239
Don't worry about her, B.A.
She's got her brother's killer.

40:48.331 --> 40:49.825
She's where she wants to be.

40:49.916 --> 40:51.707
Now we gotta get those weapons back...

40:51.793 --> 40:54.200
before the streets are on fire
in half a dozen cities.

40:54.295 --> 40:56.169
We got to change clothes.

40:57.715 --> 41:00.835
HANNlBAL: Know how to find that address?
TAWNlA: l do.

41:01.719 --> 41:03.961
l hang out at the beach quite a bit.

41:04.264 --> 41:05.426
l see.

41:21.322 --> 41:25.569
We'll have to take these on the first run
and come back for the rest.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.531
You stay here and make sure
Harnett doesn't show up and make trouble.

41:32.625 --> 41:35.662
lf he does, float him away.

41:41.342 --> 41:43.050
[Truck engine starting]

41:50.184 --> 41:52.473
[Fast-paced instrumental music]

42:05.575 --> 42:07.235
Sit tight, Tawnia.

42:16.002 --> 42:17.959
[Dramatic instrumental music]

42:56.334 --> 42:57.709
Book him, Dan-O.

43:04.300 --> 43:05.794
HANNlBAL: Back off.

43:12.934 --> 43:15.389
Some people never learn.

43:18.356 --> 43:20.064
[Murdock singing]

43:24.737 --> 43:28.605
-lt was a good show, B.A. Maybe my best.
-Maybe your last.

43:28.700 --> 43:30.408
These the only guys in the van, Murdock?

43:30.493 --> 43:33.245
Yes, l checked for invisibles,
but they didn't have any.

43:33.329 --> 43:35.536
Good. Now....

43:36.958 --> 43:38.951
l have a feeling that's Colonel Decker.

43:39.043 --> 43:42.210
We'II Ieave you guys to him.
ShouId be an interesting conversation.

43:42.297 --> 43:45.547
You'll love him.
He's a real party animal. Let's go.

44:15.455 --> 44:18.621
-Where are they?
-What's it worth to you, doughboy?

44:18.708 --> 44:21.377
Maybe helping you get off a little easier.

44:23.963 --> 44:27.379
You shouldn't have said maybe.
That gave them the edge.

44:33.640 --> 44:37.388
HANNlBAL: Well, we didn't get paid,
but we did manage to frustrate Decker...

44:37.477 --> 44:39.968
which is almost as good as money.

44:40.521 --> 44:43.059
How's the smoke back there, ladies? Great?

44:43.274 --> 44:45.183
-Great.
-Good.

44:46.152 --> 44:50.316
l wish l could pay you more,
but on my salary, this is as far as l can go.

44:51.407 --> 44:53.483
l misjudged you people pretty badly.

44:53.576 --> 44:56.696
Nobody can blame you for trying
to find your brother's murderer.

44:56.788 --> 45:00.287
l for one am not gonna be chintzy
with the applause.

45:00.375 --> 45:03.162
-l'm impressed.
-l know you are.

45:03.461 --> 45:05.418
You don't even know what l'm talking about.

45:05.505 --> 45:06.619
HANNlBAL: Sure l do.

45:06.714 --> 45:09.715
You're impressed because
we managed to invade an US Army base...

45:09.801 --> 45:12.126
drive their tanks around,
stay in the guesthouse...

45:12.220 --> 45:13.928
and blow out of there without a scratch.

45:14.013 --> 45:16.587
FACE: Well, that's part of it.
HANNlBAL: l wasn't finished.

45:16.683 --> 45:21.143
We also managed to put away Harnett
and his ugly cousins Shaw and Noche.

45:21.354 --> 45:24.225
And give Decker an ulcer in the process.

45:25.066 --> 45:27.853
FACE: Yeah, l think that about--
HANNlBAL: Good.

45:28.278 --> 45:30.685
Just didn't want to miss anything.

45:31.823 --> 45:34.907
Hey, kids, do you know what time it is?

45:35.368 --> 45:36.993
Do you?

45:37.078 --> 45:40.198
Hannibal, if that fool
don't stop that crazy TV talk...

45:40.290 --> 45:42.745
l'm gonna knock him out
over the airways for real.

45:42.834 --> 45:45.407
lt's Howdy Murdock Time.

45:50.425 --> 45:54.672
Maybe our big buddy Mr. Baracus
would like to hear a song.

45:54.762 --> 45:56.173
How about Frère--

45:58.516 --> 46:01.007
B.A.: This thing's got a volume control.

46:01.603 --> 46:05.268
Yeah, now we're talking.
Least some of us are.
