00:00.083 --> 00:02.000
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.208 --> 00:03.875
The last two years are a blank.

00:03.959 --> 00:05.542
That's a fresh approach.

00:05.625 --> 00:07.083
I believe you.

00:07.166 --> 00:09.166
<i>Mike couldn't place a familiar face.</i>

00:09.250 --> 00:10.458
Whoever killed her...

00:10.542 --> 00:12.709
<i>The police couldn't identify</i>
<i>a murder victim.</i>

00:12.792 --> 00:13.875
...pulled out all her teeth.

00:13.959 --> 00:15.208
There's no signature.

00:15.291 --> 00:17.458
<i>Gabrielle was getting showered</i>
<i>with gifts...</i>

00:17.542 --> 00:18.875
The buyer asked
to remain anonymous.

00:18.959 --> 00:20.041
<i>...from a mystery suitor.</i>

00:20.125 --> 00:21.625
I'm gonna open up a pizza parlour!

00:21.709 --> 00:23.000
<i>And Lynette couldn't believe...</i>

00:23.083 --> 00:24.208
Oh, dear God.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.542
<i>...what her husband had done.</i>

00:25.625 --> 00:27.750
I want to do what you want to do.

00:27.834 --> 00:31.166
<i>Julie's first love was two-timing her.</i>

00:31.250 --> 00:33.041
<i>And Orson's first wife...</i>

00:33.125 --> 00:35.083
- I'm Alma Hodge.
<i>- ...wasn't going away...</i>

00:35.166 --> 00:36.750
- What do you think?
- I'll take it.

00:36.834 --> 00:38.542
<i>...any time soon.</i>

00:42.166 --> 00:44.917
<i>Your average housewife</i>
<i>worries constantly</i>

00:45.000 --> 00:50.125
<i>about the dangerous people</i>
<i>she sees on the nightly news.</i>

00:50.208 --> 00:53.709
<i>Which is why she buys</i>
<i>expensive alarm systems,</i>

00:54.500 --> 00:57.709
<i>carries pepper spray in her purse,</i>

00:57.792 --> 01:00.625
<i>and keeps a gun in her drawer.</i>

01:02.125 --> 01:06.333
<i>So she can go about her day</i>
<i>feeling safe and protected.</i>

01:08.917 --> 01:11.333
<i>Your average inmate</i>
<i>worries constantly</i>

01:11.417 --> 01:15.333
<i>about the dangerous people</i>
<i>he comes in contact with every day.</i>

01:17.333 --> 01:20.083
<i>Which is why he takes ordinary items,</i>

01:20.959 --> 01:23.208
<i>and turns them into weapons</i>

01:24.000 --> 01:26.583
<i>that he always keeps handy.</i>

01:26.667 --> 01:30.959
<i>So he can go about his day</i>
<i>feeling safe and protected.</i>

01:32.500 --> 01:36.041
<i>What is the difference between</i>
<i>the housewife and the inmate?</i>

01:37.625 --> 01:41.500
<i>The inmate knows the feeling</i>
<i>won't last long.</i>

02:00.375 --> 02:02.125
Delfino. Right?

02:02.792 --> 02:05.333
Yeah. So?

02:23.500 --> 02:25.166
Come on, brother. Let's go.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.083
- You okay?
- Yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.875
I owe you one.

02:30.375 --> 02:32.875
Yeah. I guess you do.

02:34.083 --> 02:39.041
<i>Yes. We all need protection</i>
<i>from those who would do us harm.</i>

02:42.083 --> 02:45.500
<i>And sometimes</i>
<i>from those who protect us.</i>

02:53.875 --> 02:55.333
<i>Wild parties.</i>

02:56.208 --> 02:58.125
<i>Handsome strangers.</i>

02:59.000 --> 03:00.792
<i>Tender kisses.</i>

03:02.166 --> 03:04.959
I had a great time. Bye, you guys.

03:05.041 --> 03:08.625
<i>Yes, there were many things</i>
<i>Gabrielle Solis liked</i>

03:08.709 --> 03:11.250
<i>about being single again.</i>

03:12.500 --> 03:15.041
<i>But coming home to an empty house</i>

03:16.750 --> 03:18.291
<i>was not one of them.</i>

03:34.000 --> 03:36.333
Hi, you're sleeping at my place tonight.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.625
Really?

03:38.500 --> 03:40.709
What did you have in mind?

03:40.792 --> 03:42.417
God, I hate my life.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.583
Oh, honestly, did you think
I was gonna sleep with you?

03:45.667 --> 03:47.333
It would be the polite way to thank me.

03:47.417 --> 03:50.625
Carlos, this isn't funny.
I am scared to death of this maniac.

03:50.709 --> 03:52.375
Since when?

03:52.458 --> 03:55.583
Yesterday you were loving
all the presents, the intrigue.

03:55.667 --> 03:59.417
The guy broke into the house.
He went from secret admirer to stalker.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.417
For all I know, he's trying to kill me
so no one else will have me.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.208
- Why don't you just call the cops?
- And tell them what?

04:05.291 --> 04:08.834
"911? Somebody broke in the house
and left a $6,000 dress."

04:08.917 --> 04:13.000
Okay, so if this guy shows up again,
what am I supposed to do, exactly?

04:13.083 --> 04:16.583
Nothing. Just having you here helps.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.375
Now, that's very sweet.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.291
Because when he breaks in and
starts hacking you up with his machete,

04:21.375 --> 04:24.959
your screams will wake me up
and then I'll be able to escape.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.917
Glad I could help.

04:34.583 --> 04:37.959
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.

04:38.041 --> 04:41.375
You have good timing.
I just got all the kids to sleep.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.667
Oh, damn. I wanted to tuck them in.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.709
Well, you could tuck me in.

04:47.875 --> 04:51.250
I thought I smelled your sex perfume.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.917
Come here. Hi.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.458
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.083
Oh, oh, oh.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

04:58.166 --> 04:59.458
Don't get me all revved up just yet.

04:59.542 --> 05:02.625
The printer said he was gonna
drop off my menu on his way home.

05:02.709 --> 05:04.375
He already did.

05:05.709 --> 05:08.166
Oh, you didn't look at that, did you?
'Cause it's just a mockup.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.959
Too late. I looked. And it's great.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.291
- Really?
- Yes.

05:14.375 --> 05:17.625
I love the font, the colour, everything.

05:17.709 --> 05:21.291
I am so jazzed to see the restaurant.

05:21.375 --> 05:24.041
It is so good to hear that.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.458
So, any idea when that might be?

05:32.291 --> 05:33.625
Sure.

05:33.709 --> 05:37.250
- How about two weeks?
- Hey.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.000
You open in two weeks.

05:39.083 --> 05:41.000
Yeah, well, that'd be a good time
for you to come by

05:41.083 --> 05:43.709
'cause there's free refills,
balloons, music.

05:43.792 --> 05:46.291
Might there be a VIP preview

05:46.375 --> 05:49.083
for people, say,
who bore your children?

05:51.208 --> 05:53.291
- Lynette.
- Yeah?

05:53.375 --> 05:56.166
I don't want you to see it
until it's all done.

05:57.542 --> 05:58.709
Why not?

05:58.792 --> 06:00.291
Because you will take
one look at the place

06:00.375 --> 06:02.375
and then you'll have
all these tips and suggestions

06:02.458 --> 06:04.875
that you just won't be able
to keep to yourself.

06:04.959 --> 06:07.083
You think?
'Cause I just saw a takeout menu

06:07.166 --> 06:09.458
with a six-digit phone number
and I kept that to myself.

06:09.542 --> 06:12.792
See? There it is.
That snarky, know-it-all attitude.

06:12.875 --> 06:16.959
What? I am snarky because I point out
one small, glaring mistake?

06:17.041 --> 06:20.375
That's it.
Now you're banned from the opening.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.500
Fine. Good night.

06:26.709 --> 06:28.792
So, we're not having sex?

06:29.834 --> 06:32.458
Hey, you banned me
from your opening.

06:41.250 --> 06:44.792
All I'm saying is that
I'd feel a lot safer on the pill.

06:44.875 --> 06:47.125
But if you're not 18,
you need parental consent.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.375
Do we really need to give your mother
another reason to hate me?

06:49.458 --> 06:52.959
She'll hate you a lot worse
if you get me... Hey!

06:53.041 --> 06:54.250
Hi.

06:54.959 --> 06:56.125
Hi.

06:58.625 --> 06:59.709
Bye.

06:59.792 --> 07:01.417
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:07.959 --> 07:10.208
Can't we just keep using condoms
and be extra careful?

07:10.291 --> 07:12.125
Are you crazy?
They're not dependable.

07:12.208 --> 07:13.375
Sure they are.

07:13.458 --> 07:14.667
Why do you think
everybody uses them?

07:14.750 --> 07:17.166
Read the box.
They all have to pass inspection.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.667
It's too risky.
Condoms are only 85% effective.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.709
Mom!

07:23.792 --> 07:26.417
Mom, what happened? Are you okay?

07:26.500 --> 07:29.417
Oh, I was just...

07:29.500 --> 07:31.500
I lost an earring.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.333
Mom, you're wearing
both your earrings.

07:35.458 --> 07:37.750
Oh, I found it.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.375
Austin, I would like to talk
to my daughter, privately.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.291
Sure. Call me later.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.250
Why were you two
talking about condoms?

07:51.333 --> 07:52.375
Why were you eavesdropping?

07:52.458 --> 07:55.083
Don't change the subject.
Are you two having sex?

07:55.166 --> 07:57.834
Because I thought that I raised you
to be smarter than that.

07:57.917 --> 08:01.083
Don't you realise
that sex is not fun and games.

08:01.166 --> 08:02.291
It's dangerous.

08:02.375 --> 08:03.959
Every time you turn around
there's a new disease.

08:04.041 --> 08:05.625
Do you want it to burn when you pee?

08:05.709 --> 08:06.792
- Mom.
- Sex kills.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.583
- Mom!
- What?

08:08.667 --> 08:10.417
I'm not having sex.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.041
- Really?
- Really.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.166
Oh, thank God.

08:18.625 --> 08:22.166
If you're not having sex,
why were you talking about condoms?

08:22.250 --> 08:25.125
Because we know
two kids at school who are,

08:25.208 --> 08:27.875
and they're only using condoms,
which is really stupid

08:27.959 --> 08:31.041
because condoms
are only 85% effective.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.792
Yes. That's right.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.834
A condom alone will not protect you.

08:38.542 --> 08:40.208
I totally agree.

08:52.875 --> 08:54.709
- Bree!
- Alma.

08:54.792 --> 08:56.709
I didn't know that you knew Edie.

08:56.792 --> 09:00.875
I told your friends at that dinner party
I was looking for a new house.

09:00.959 --> 09:04.208
- A house?
- Yes, and Gabby introduced us.

09:05.208 --> 09:08.041
Oh, well, I don't want to keep you.

09:08.125 --> 09:12.125
I'm sure that Edie has
lots of other houses to show you.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.625
Nope, we're done.

09:13.709 --> 09:16.000
Alma took one look
at the Applewhite house

09:16.083 --> 09:18.208
and bam, love at first sight.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.750
- What?
- We're gonna be neighbours.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.041
No!

09:23.834 --> 09:26.250
I mean... I mean, no.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.208
Alma, you can't buy this house.

09:28.291 --> 09:31.291
- Why not?
- Well, are you aware of its history?

09:31.375 --> 09:34.709
The previous owner
was harbouring a murderer.

09:34.792 --> 09:36.333
It was her son.

09:36.417 --> 09:38.500
Say what you like,
she was a great mom.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.458
They had a dungeon in the basement.

09:40.542 --> 09:42.333
I mean, people say
they still hear groans

09:42.417 --> 09:44.333
coming from the house at night.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.542
They're gonna hear groans
coming from your house

09:46.625 --> 09:48.417
if you don't zip it.

09:49.417 --> 09:50.625
Don't worry, Alma.

09:50.709 --> 09:54.417
I'm sure that Edie can find you a house
that won't give you nightmares.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.542
It's too late, Bree.

09:56.625 --> 09:59.125
I've fallen in love
with this neighbourhood.

09:59.208 --> 10:02.125
And as for that haunted house stuff,
well, that's just silly.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.625
People don't come back from the dead.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.792
Don't I wish.

10:18.583 --> 10:21.041
I will not have that woman
as a neighbour!

10:21.125 --> 10:23.667
- You have got to do something!
- I said I'd talk to her.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.667
- So what are you waiting for?
- The house is dark. She's not there.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.917
Oh, so you're just gonna wait
until she moves in?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.041
I will deal with it.
Bree, please calm down.

10:31.125 --> 10:32.250
How can I be calm?

10:32.333 --> 10:34.667
For months, people thought
you killed your first wife.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.041
No sooner does she show up
and clear your name,

10:37.125 --> 10:39.917
than the police haul you off
to ask you about another murder.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.583
- They just had some questions.
- Everybody has questions.

10:42.667 --> 10:44.625
Susan and I aren't even speaking
because of it.

10:44.709 --> 10:46.041
Bree, please.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.709
I try to hold my head up and smile

10:48.792 --> 10:51.625
and just bake more pies
for the church social.

10:51.709 --> 10:53.959
But now your ex
is camped out on our doorstep

10:54.041 --> 10:56.500
like I am hosting some kind of
Mormon slumber party!

10:56.583 --> 11:00.208
And I do not know how I'm gonna
bake my way out of this one.

11:01.083 --> 11:04.792
Darling, I swear to you,
I will get Alma out of that house.

11:04.875 --> 11:08.542
I don't care if I have to live up to
my reputation and strangle her.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.667
You're a good husband.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.959
Have you lost your mind?

11:16.041 --> 11:18.458
I am not getting you the pill.

11:18.542 --> 11:21.041
- Aunt Edie, Julie and I are in love.
- Oh, please.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.709
It's not love you're feeling,
it's hormones.

11:23.792 --> 11:26.917
- That's not true.
- Okay, fine.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.917
If you want to express your love,
you don't need to go all the way.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.166
Kiss. Touch. Rub.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.625
I mean, whatever happened
to heavy petting?

11:36.709 --> 11:38.667
It's so underrated.

11:38.750 --> 11:40.625
That's your advice?

11:40.709 --> 11:44.500
Well, I'm sorry. I've never been good
at getting people not to have sex.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.542
So you're not gonna help us?

11:46.625 --> 11:51.709
Julie, if I do this,
your mother would have my head.

11:51.792 --> 11:54.458
- You should be talking to her.
- I can't talk to her.

11:54.542 --> 11:56.917
The whole idea of this
completely freaks her out.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.375
She started screaming, "Sex kills."

12:00.542 --> 12:02.625
So now it's all in my lap.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.917
God, she pisses me off.

12:05.709 --> 12:09.417
Look, how about
I spring for a box of condoms?

12:09.500 --> 12:11.834
Will that get you two off my back?

12:11.917 --> 12:14.417
Condoms are only 85% effective.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.041
Is that true?

12:17.375 --> 12:20.959
Damn. I thought I could coast
all the way to menopause.

12:21.041 --> 12:24.500
Look, we're gonna have sex
whether you help us or not.

12:24.583 --> 12:26.959
We're just trying to be responsible.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.166
All right.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.041
But, just so you know,

12:34.125 --> 12:36.667
the responsible thing
is to abstain from sex

12:36.750 --> 12:38.917
and focus on your studies.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.000
There.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.959
I said it out loud
just in case anybody asks.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.375
Gabby, I need another pillow.

12:48.458 --> 12:51.291
All right. Don't take the big one.
That's my favourite.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.250
It's only for one night.

12:53.333 --> 12:55.875
'Cause tomorrow I'm gonna be
back home sleeping in my own bed.

12:55.959 --> 12:58.000
What? You can't abandon me.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.083
There's a madman stalking me.

13:00.166 --> 13:02.333
My life is on the line.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.667
Do you know how scared I am?

13:05.166 --> 13:06.959
You're keeping that?

13:08.375 --> 13:10.917
Hey, I'm scared, but not of the dress.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.500
Carlos!

13:34.583 --> 13:37.500
Carlos, wake up! I need you!

13:37.583 --> 13:40.959
- Yeah. I thought you'd come around.
- What? No!

13:41.041 --> 13:43.333
- Hey!
- He's here!

13:56.667 --> 13:59.333
Carlos, be careful!
He might have a gun!

14:00.417 --> 14:02.166
I'm unarmed. Stop kicking me.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.542
Oh, now you're gonna
give me attitude?

14:04.625 --> 14:06.041
Gabby, we got him. Maintain.

14:06.125 --> 14:08.750
This jerk has been terrorising me!
He broke into my house!

14:08.834 --> 14:10.542
It was a $6,000 dress.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.792
And my boss didn't want me
leaving it on the porch.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.166
Your boss?

14:16.250 --> 14:19.667
Hey, I'm sorry to wake you, sir,

14:19.750 --> 14:22.917
but there was a problem
dropping off the gift.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.834
Yes, and she's right here with me.

14:25.917 --> 14:28.834
This is Gabrielle. Who the hell is this?

14:28.917 --> 14:32.667
Yes, I got your "token of esteem"
and I'm not impressed.

14:32.750 --> 14:36.083
Because you're freaking me out,
that's why!

14:36.166 --> 14:39.750
No, I don't care how much it costs.
That's beside the point.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.166
Really? That much?

14:43.250 --> 14:44.834
Tell him if he doesn't
stop harassing you,

14:44.917 --> 14:46.542
you're gonna call the cops.

14:46.625 --> 14:48.792
Look, I know
you're trying to be romantic,

14:48.875 --> 14:51.667
but if you keep this up,
I'm gonna be forced...

14:55.875 --> 14:57.083
What did he say?

14:57.166 --> 15:01.166
That's very sweet of you, but I am not
the most beautiful woman in the world.

15:01.250 --> 15:03.834
Tell him you're gonna get
a restraining order on him.

15:03.917 --> 15:05.625
Yes, I may be in the top 10.

15:05.709 --> 15:08.333
- Gabby!
- Hey, I'm talking here.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.917
Your voice sounds so familiar.
Do I know you?

15:14.542 --> 15:16.125
He says I know him

15:16.208 --> 15:18.750
and that he wants
to reintroduce himself at dinner.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.750
Absolutely not.

15:20.834 --> 15:24.166
I would not feel comfortable
meeting for dinner.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.667
Good girl.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.041
- How about lunch?
- Gabby!

15:27.125 --> 15:30.875
But you have to promise to
stop buying me these expensive gifts.

15:30.959 --> 15:33.417
Because I'm not that kind of girl.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.875
Well, for that many carats,
yes, I could be that kind of girl.

15:37.625 --> 15:40.208
I got to go. I'll talk to you tomorrow!

15:41.583 --> 15:43.166
Oh, how about that?

15:43.250 --> 15:46.667
And here I was thinking some guy
wants to murder me in my sleep.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.792
The night's still young.

15:59.458 --> 16:03.792
- How're those ribs?
- Oh, just needed some tape.

16:03.875 --> 16:07.667
I mean, those guys were hard core.
You really saved my ass.

16:07.750 --> 16:12.000
- Don't mention it.
- No. Seriously.

16:12.083 --> 16:15.875
Ever anything I can do for you,
you just say the word.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.875
I'll keep that in mind.

16:18.375 --> 16:19.750
Hey, Delfino.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.917
Yeah, boss.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.208
Might want to find yourself
another prom date.

16:27.291 --> 16:29.583
That guy's not your friend.

16:29.667 --> 16:30.917
How do you know that?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.250
After those mutts
knocked you around the other day,

16:33.333 --> 16:35.250
your boy paid them off.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.917
- You sure?
- I saw money change hands.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.041
So watch your back.

16:50.166 --> 16:52.208
So, I was in the middle
of totally freaking out

16:52.291 --> 16:55.000
when Julie assured me
that she's not having sex.

16:55.083 --> 16:58.083
- I can't tell you how relieved I was.
- Uh-huh.

16:59.250 --> 17:02.125
Don't say "uh-huh" like that.
Julie wouldn't lie to me.

17:02.208 --> 17:05.917
If she says she's not having sex,
then she's not having sex.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.959
- Okay.
- You can't say "okay" like that, either.

17:10.041 --> 17:13.291
Julie's not like other girls.
She's a straight-A student.

17:13.375 --> 17:15.250
And you were valedictorian.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.083
What were you up to that
your mother didn't know about?

17:20.125 --> 17:22.625
Okay, you search the closet.
I'm gonna look under the bed.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.792
Wait, wait, wait.

17:23.875 --> 17:29.333
First rule of ransacking,
remember where everything goes.

17:29.417 --> 17:32.125
You are gonna make
a really good mother some day.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.750
So, what does this diary look like?

17:34.834 --> 17:37.166
It's small. It's got a plaid cover.

17:37.250 --> 17:39.375
Oh, and when you find it,
you have to read it.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.083
Because I promised her
that I would always respect her privacy.

17:42.166 --> 17:44.709
- Now help me flip this mattress.
- Oh, my God!

17:44.792 --> 17:46.041
You found it?

17:46.125 --> 17:49.166
This is adorable.
You think maybe I could...

17:49.250 --> 17:51.041
No, you cannot borrow it.

17:51.917 --> 17:53.166
Fine.

17:54.291 --> 17:58.125
- Why does Julie have a VCR?
- To watch movies.

17:58.208 --> 18:00.417
Please.
Kids don't watch videos any more.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.417
Everything's digital.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.125
See? It's just a tape.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.500
Is it?

18:31.250 --> 18:32.458
Alma.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.583
What do you think you're doing?

18:36.458 --> 18:38.333
Measuring for drapes.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.583
I'm thinking damask.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.250
You know what I mean.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.583
Why have you moved here?

18:45.667 --> 18:48.291
Well, it's a very nice street.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.583
And I've made friends here.

18:51.667 --> 18:54.166
People have taken
such an interest in me.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.375
Yeah, they thought you were dead.

18:56.458 --> 19:00.625
The novelty of your not being a corpse
can't last forever.

19:00.709 --> 19:02.291
What are you after?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.709
Are you still punishing me?

19:04.792 --> 19:07.250
You want me to pay you to leave?
What?

19:08.291 --> 19:11.000
I want what I've always wanted.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.250
You.

19:13.917 --> 19:15.458
I'm married.

19:16.583 --> 19:19.375
And even if I weren't, I don't love you.

19:20.834 --> 19:24.709
You didn't love the old Alma.
I'm not that woman any more.

19:24.792 --> 19:27.291
I'm stronger, more confident.

19:27.375 --> 19:31.250
It may take you a while to see that,
but I can wait.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.458
Alma, I love Bree.

19:33.542 --> 19:35.500
But does she love you?

19:36.125 --> 19:39.208
Oh, she may love
the Orson she knows.

19:40.583 --> 19:43.208
But does she know
what you did to Monique?

19:44.709 --> 19:47.500
Does she know
you ran over Mike Delfino?

19:48.959 --> 19:50.625
I know all that.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.125
I still love you.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.542
Would she?

20:07.041 --> 20:09.250
So, I see you've spoken to Mother.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.667
Yes.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.834
It's nice to have someone
on my side in all of this.

20:16.542 --> 20:19.041
Don't worry. I won't tell Bree.

20:19.125 --> 20:23.250
She might go to the police
and you're no good to me in jail.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.166
But if I thought
I had no chance with you,

20:29.250 --> 20:31.458
no chance at all,

20:31.542 --> 20:34.625
well, there'd be nothing to stop me
from telling.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.417
Please, Orson,

20:40.125 --> 20:42.166
don't take away my hope.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.834
She's not going.

20:57.834 --> 20:59.166
Why not?

20:59.917 --> 21:02.417
And what the hell
was that on the porch?

21:02.500 --> 21:05.709
She kissed me goodbye.
What was I supposed to do, slug her?

21:05.792 --> 21:07.917
You went over there
to read her the riot act.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.333
Instead it looked like you were
reading her a bedtime story.

21:10.417 --> 21:13.375
Bree, I told her we don't want her here.

21:13.458 --> 21:17.041
I threatened, I shouted.
She refuses to go.

21:17.125 --> 21:19.792
We're just gonna
have to make the best of it.

21:27.041 --> 21:30.500
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

21:30.583 --> 21:32.083
<i>You want to meet for lunch?</i>

21:32.166 --> 21:36.000
No, honey, I got to drive to Greendale
to pick out napkins.

21:36.083 --> 21:38.166
Remember, I told you.

21:38.250 --> 21:42.208
<i>Oh, yeah, that's right.</i>
<i>So, I'll see you tonight.</i>

21:42.291 --> 21:44.542
Okay, good. I'll see you.

22:12.125 --> 22:15.375
Oh, my God.

22:19.959 --> 22:22.125
Hey, Mrs Scavo.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.542
Andrew, hi.

22:23.625 --> 22:25.875
I thought you weren't starting
until the opening.

22:25.959 --> 22:28.291
Oh, yeah. There's just so much work
that needs to be done.

22:28.375 --> 22:31.500
- Mr Scavo asked me to start early.
- Oh.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.291
He's not here, by the way.

22:33.375 --> 22:36.500
Yeah, I know.
And, hey, don't tell him I stopped by.

22:36.583 --> 22:40.458
I'm not supposed to be here.
I just wanted to sneak a peek.

22:44.041 --> 22:46.375
Shouldn't you be working?

22:46.458 --> 22:49.041
Shouldn't you not be here?

22:49.125 --> 22:50.875
Touché.

22:50.959 --> 22:52.959
So, how do you like the place?

22:53.917 --> 22:56.792
I think it's fantastic.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.500
It's really coming together.
I love the bar.

23:00.583 --> 23:02.333
Oh, yeah. It's pretty cool.

23:02.417 --> 23:04.792
It's too bad
we can't get a liquor licence.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.208
What?

23:06.291 --> 23:09.250
Oh, didn't Mr Scavo tell you?

23:09.333 --> 23:11.375
No, he didn't.

23:12.458 --> 23:16.625
Don't restaurants
make half their money on the liquor?

23:16.709 --> 23:19.834
Oh, yeah. We're completely screwed.

23:19.917 --> 23:22.333
This is a nightmare.

23:22.417 --> 23:24.125
How did this happen?

23:24.208 --> 23:25.792
Oh, the city re-zoned

23:25.875 --> 23:29.333
and said he had to get all the residents
within a block to sign a waiver.

23:29.417 --> 23:31.792
There are some holdouts.
He's kind of bumming.

23:31.875 --> 23:35.917
Well, then why isn't he dealing with it
instead of shopping for napkins?

23:39.417 --> 23:42.166
We could lose our shirts in this dump!

23:44.709 --> 23:46.875
Is this Dr Marvin Tashman?

23:47.333 --> 23:52.125
Hi. My name is Susan Mayer.
My daughter Julie came in to see you.

23:52.208 --> 23:53.792
Yes, about birth control.

23:53.875 --> 23:55.875
So, I'm just curious.

23:55.959 --> 23:59.834
Where do you get off prescribing that
without my consent?

24:01.792 --> 24:04.583
What?
No, I most certainly was not there.

24:05.542 --> 24:07.333
What do I look like?

24:07.417 --> 24:09.500
I don't have blonde hair.

24:14.667 --> 24:17.875
Wait.
Did my blonde hair have dark roots?

24:19.875 --> 24:23.625
Oh, I forgot to give you
the keys to the shed.

24:25.667 --> 24:28.458
You got my daughter the pill?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.667
Here. Catch.

24:33.917 --> 24:36.709
Don't you walk away from me!

24:36.792 --> 24:39.709
- Do we have to do this now?
- Yes, we do.

24:39.792 --> 24:42.250
You might have gotten
your first diaphragm with milk money,

24:42.333 --> 24:44.834
but that doesn't give you the right
to corrupt my daughter!

24:44.917 --> 24:46.667
Look, it's not like
I went after Julie and said,

24:46.750 --> 24:49.417
"Hey, do you want to go out
for a burger and some birth control?"

24:49.500 --> 24:50.792
She came to me.

24:50.875 --> 24:54.959
You do not get to decide this for her!
What were you thinking?

24:55.041 --> 24:59.625
I was thinking if Julie got knocked up,
that you and I could become family.

24:59.709 --> 25:01.583
And I'm sorry,
I cannot take that chance.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.500
Oh, you know what? It was until
your rotten nephew came to town

25:04.583 --> 25:06.250
that Julie was a perfect kid.

25:06.333 --> 25:10.000
And now she's lying and scheming
and having casual sex!

25:10.083 --> 25:12.667
She's just a boob job away
from being you!

25:12.750 --> 25:17.250
Look, Mayer, Julie has discovered sex.
The genie is out of the bottle.

25:17.333 --> 25:20.125
You better get good with it
or you could lose her forever.

25:20.208 --> 25:22.917
'Cause like it or not, she loves him.

25:23.667 --> 25:26.709
And you know what else? He loves her.

25:40.959 --> 25:42.709
Your gentleman friend
went to make a call.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.208
- He'll be with you shortly.
- Thank you.

26:06.667 --> 26:08.083
Gabrielle.

26:11.125 --> 26:15.709
Zach Young! Oh, my God!
It's been ages.

26:15.792 --> 26:17.333
Wow!

26:17.417 --> 26:20.542
Look at you! So handsome in a suit.

26:20.625 --> 26:23.625
- You look beautiful.
- Aren't you sweet?

26:25.500 --> 26:29.875
Well, anyway, I'd love to catch up,
but I'm kind of waiting for someone.

26:30.583 --> 26:32.166
Yes, I know.

26:37.166 --> 26:39.458
So, the dress fits. Cool.

26:48.542 --> 26:52.041
I'd like a bottle of your 1982
Château Lafite-Rothschild, please.

26:52.125 --> 26:54.458
I'm sorry. How old are you?

26:55.250 --> 26:59.458
Oh, why don't we say 100?

27:00.834 --> 27:02.291
So you are.

27:04.709 --> 27:07.542
Wow, someone got an advance
on their allowance.

27:07.625 --> 27:09.750
I was my grandfather's sole heir.

27:09.834 --> 27:12.041
I'm actually in the Fortune 400.

27:13.250 --> 27:16.750
- Does that seem weird to you?
- I'm on a date with Zach Young.

27:16.834 --> 27:19.417
Nothing's ever gonna
seem weird again.

27:21.291 --> 27:24.667
Every cent we have is circling the bowl
and Tom never said a word.

27:24.750 --> 27:27.750
- Why didn't he come to me?
- Well, clearly, he's embarrassed.

27:27.834 --> 27:30.875
- But I'm his wife!
- Don't be dense, Lynette.

27:30.959 --> 27:32.875
Half the reason men
want to accomplish anything

27:32.959 --> 27:34.792
is so they can show off
for the women they love.

27:34.875 --> 27:37.458
And when they fail,
they like to keep it to themselves.

27:37.542 --> 27:38.667
I'm gonna tell him.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.583
I'm gonna tell him
I went to the restaurant

27:40.667 --> 27:42.333
and that I know he screwed up.

27:42.417 --> 27:45.417
And that I'm gonna fix it.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.750
Oh, for God's sake,
it's bad enough you cut off his cojones.

27:47.834 --> 27:51.625
- Now you want to juggle them?
- My husband is in trouble.

27:51.709 --> 27:53.792
I love him.
Shouldn't I want to help him?

27:53.875 --> 27:54.959
Well, if you really love him,

27:55.041 --> 27:57.709
you should help him
without letting him know that you did.

28:01.917 --> 28:04.667
Yeah, so in addition to my penthouse,

28:04.750 --> 28:08.959
I also have a château in Switzerland
and a cottage in the Hamptons.

28:09.041 --> 28:11.542
It's pretty impressive, huh?

28:11.625 --> 28:14.458
You got a little chocolate on your shirt.

28:14.542 --> 28:16.083
- Damn it!
- Here, let me get it.

28:16.166 --> 28:17.500
No, I can do it! I can do it!

28:17.583 --> 28:20.166
I'd like to do it myself.
Thank you very much.

28:22.083 --> 28:25.291
I'm sorry. You know,
I'll be neater for you next time.

28:25.375 --> 28:29.500
Next time? Honey, let's get real.
You are way too young for me.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.417
I'm two months older
than John Rowland.

28:35.875 --> 28:38.625
Well, John Rowland was a mistake.

28:38.709 --> 28:40.250
I was lonely.

28:41.083 --> 28:43.083
You're not lonely now?

28:44.041 --> 28:45.792
You've heard about my divorce?

28:45.875 --> 28:47.875
Yeah, you were really smart
to get rid of Carlos.

28:47.959 --> 28:50.083
You deserve much better.

28:50.166 --> 28:53.208
And let me guess,
now you're my upgrade?

28:53.291 --> 28:57.667
Well, everybody knows you need
someone to take care of you

28:57.750 --> 28:58.959
and I'm rich now.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.166
I can give you anything you want.

29:01.250 --> 29:02.333
Wait a minute.

29:02.417 --> 29:04.792
Who says I need someone
to take care of me?

29:04.875 --> 29:07.834
My mom.
Her friends from the neighbourhood.

29:07.917 --> 29:10.125
They said it was the only reason
you stayed with Carlos,

29:10.208 --> 29:12.583
considering how he treated you.

29:16.041 --> 29:19.709
Well, they were wrong.
Thank you for lunch, Zach.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.417
Wait, Gabrielle.

29:22.500 --> 29:25.125
I'm not that awkward kid
that I was before.

29:26.458 --> 29:29.542
Can you please just...
Please take me seriously.

29:29.625 --> 29:31.834
I'm sorry. I just can't.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.667
I'm not gonna give up.

29:35.583 --> 29:39.291
Oh, sweetie. I really wish you would.

29:46.583 --> 29:47.917
For God's sake, Zach!

29:48.000 --> 29:51.625
Don't hijack a Ferrari
if you don't know how to drive.

29:57.333 --> 29:59.750
Mr Gaunt? Hi, I'm Lynette Scavo.

29:59.834 --> 30:02.625
My husband is opening the pizzeria
right down the block.

30:02.709 --> 30:06.291
If it's about that liquor licence,
I'm not signing.

30:06.375 --> 30:09.375
Please, I've been at this for hours.
Just hear me out.

30:09.458 --> 30:13.250
- Well, I never could resist a pretty lady.
- Oh.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.166
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

30:16.792 --> 30:20.750
- Did you live in Las Vegas?
- I was a croupier for 40 years.

30:20.834 --> 30:23.667
As you can see,
I had a weakness for showgirls.

30:23.750 --> 30:26.000
I bet you were quite the player.

30:26.083 --> 30:28.166
You have no idea.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.625
- Can I top you off there?
- No, thanks. Two's my limit.

30:32.709 --> 30:34.792
Well, suit yourself.

30:34.875 --> 30:39.000
Look, I understand your concerns
about the licence.

30:39.083 --> 30:40.959
Your neighbours had them, too.

30:41.041 --> 30:43.083
But they signed the waiver

30:43.166 --> 30:46.792
once I explained to them
that this is a family restaurant.

30:46.875 --> 30:50.000
No late nights, no loud music.

30:50.083 --> 30:51.834
If there's one thing I learned in Vegas,

30:51.917 --> 30:55.709
it's that booze turns most people
into noisy jackasses.

30:55.792 --> 30:58.250
And I don't want them
puking on my doorstep.

30:58.333 --> 31:02.500
Come on, Harry.
You are my last holdout.

31:02.583 --> 31:04.625
What's it gonna take? Cash?

31:04.709 --> 31:07.208
Free pizza for the rest of your life?
You name it.

31:07.291 --> 31:11.834
Look, I hate to disappoint a pretty lady,
but I'm not signing.

31:14.166 --> 31:20.041
Harry, my husband quit his job
to start this restaurant.

31:20.125 --> 31:22.792
And if we can't sell liquor,
we can't make a profit and...

31:22.875 --> 31:26.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Harry.
Eyes up here.

31:26.375 --> 31:28.208
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

31:29.417 --> 31:32.333
This place is his dream.

31:32.417 --> 31:36.000
And if he can't make it work,
then it's just gonna kill him,

31:36.083 --> 31:38.166
and consequently,
it's gonna kill our marriage.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.417
And, Harry... Harry, what did I say?

31:40.500 --> 31:42.875
I know. I don't mean to be rude.

31:42.959 --> 31:46.000
It's just that my showgirl days
were a while ago

31:46.083 --> 31:49.500
and I can't remember
the last time I laid eyes on

31:49.583 --> 31:52.333
a beautiful woman's bosom.

31:58.709 --> 31:59.875
Really?

31:59.959 --> 32:02.208
Well, what if I were to,

32:03.500 --> 32:07.542
very briefly, refresh your memory?

32:14.041 --> 32:17.041
- Completely worth it.
- Glad you thought so.

32:29.125 --> 32:32.583
Come on, baby.
Say it one more time for Mommy.

32:32.667 --> 32:34.542
So, you can teach him to say
whatever you want?

32:34.625 --> 32:39.166
Oh, yes. These birds are very bright.
I think they're smarter than people.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.333
Some people, anyway.

32:46.458 --> 32:49.625
Bree! Come in.
I just made some lemonade.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.375
This isn't a social call.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.417
We need to talk.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.083
About what?

33:03.166 --> 33:06.709
About what it's gonna take to get you
to sell this house and move.

33:06.792 --> 33:08.875
Move? Why?

33:08.959 --> 33:10.709
You're my husband's ex-wife.

33:10.792 --> 33:13.375
You disappeared
so people would think he killed you.

33:13.458 --> 33:17.083
Does my discomfort
really need any further explanation?

33:17.542 --> 33:20.834
- I had no idea you felt this way.
- Oh, please.

33:21.542 --> 33:24.458
Orson made it perfectly clear
we don't want you here.

33:24.542 --> 33:27.250
Okay, now I'm really confused.

33:27.333 --> 33:30.166
When Orson came by, all he said was,

33:30.250 --> 33:33.917
"Welcome to the street"
and did I need help unpacking?

33:36.166 --> 33:37.834
That's not true.

33:39.250 --> 33:42.500
You know what?
I think I've said too much.

33:42.583 --> 33:44.542
How about that lemonade?

33:46.667 --> 33:51.125
- Ma'am, where would you like this?
- Oh, upstairs. I'll show you.

33:52.959 --> 33:53.959
Here. Drink this.

33:54.041 --> 33:56.875
You look a little pale.
I'll be right back.

34:01.542 --> 34:03.208
Don't tell Bree.

34:06.125 --> 34:07.834
Don't tell Bree.

35:02.875 --> 35:04.792
Are you all right?

35:04.875 --> 35:08.166
I'm so sorry. I broke a glass.

35:08.250 --> 35:11.583
- Don't worry. I'll get it.
- Well, okay.

35:11.667 --> 35:13.417
I have to go.

35:13.959 --> 35:16.709
Oh, Bree. Wait.

35:18.458 --> 35:21.083
I understand why you
might feel a little threatened

35:21.166 --> 35:23.875
about my moving in here.

35:23.959 --> 35:27.750
But in time, you'll see
I'm perfectly harmless.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.917
So, how was the mystery date?

35:47.000 --> 35:50.083
Oh, it was fabulous. Thanks for asking.

35:50.166 --> 35:52.250
Oh, come on, I want details.
Who is he?

35:52.333 --> 35:55.083
Oh, some global financier.

35:55.166 --> 35:59.792
Saw me on the cover of <i>Paris Match.</i>
Good looking. Just not my type.

35:59.875 --> 36:01.625
Really?

36:01.709 --> 36:05.500
'Cause I always thought that you and
Zach would make a really great couple.

36:05.583 --> 36:07.875
You son of a bitch. You were there?

36:07.959 --> 36:10.291
Parked across the street,
laughing my ass off.

36:10.375 --> 36:13.125
I can't believe you followed me!

36:13.208 --> 36:15.291
I thought you were meeting
a psycho killer for lunch.

36:15.375 --> 36:16.917
I was worried.

36:18.250 --> 36:22.208
At least until they brought out
the crayons and children's menus.

36:22.291 --> 36:23.667
All right. Off my porch.

36:23.750 --> 36:27.166
Okay, but don't forget,
you asked me to watch your back.

36:27.875 --> 36:29.625
Yeah, about that.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.875
I'm installing
an alarm system tomorrow,

36:32.959 --> 36:36.291
so I'm not gonna need you
to look after me any more.

36:37.375 --> 36:40.417
- Gabby, I don't mind.
- I mind.

36:40.500 --> 36:43.875
We're divorced. I can't keep running
to you every time I get scared.

36:43.959 --> 36:47.417
I want to be the kind of woman
who can take care of herself.

36:48.208 --> 36:51.750
Well, good for you.

36:56.625 --> 36:58.959
I'm still right down the block.

36:59.959 --> 37:04.417
- So if you do need me...
- I won't, but thank you.

37:13.834 --> 37:15.917
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:16.709 --> 37:19.083
- You're home early.
- I'm celebrating.

37:19.166 --> 37:22.166
We got our liquor licence today.

37:22.250 --> 37:23.542
Really? That's great.

37:23.625 --> 37:27.000
Yeah. Andrew said he went all over
the neighbourhood to get signatures.

37:27.083 --> 37:28.875
Good for him.

37:28.959 --> 37:31.333
But I think he's lying.

37:31.417 --> 37:34.000
I think somebody else
got the signatures.

37:34.083 --> 37:38.750
Okay, let's say, just for the sake
of argument, that someone else did.

37:38.834 --> 37:41.291
Someone who clearly loves you
very much.

37:41.375 --> 37:43.917
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing. Nothing.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.917
Order has been restored
in the universe.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.083
You saved the day. I'm a loser.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.041
Oh, come on, Tom.

37:51.125 --> 37:53.667
I tried for two months
to get that waiver signed.

37:53.750 --> 37:57.041
You did it in a day. Like I said...

37:57.125 --> 37:58.917
You can't drown in self-pity

37:59.000 --> 38:02.333
just because I helped you
with one tiny little thing.

38:02.417 --> 38:04.792
Okay, but if I tell you that
the plumbing's not up to code,

38:04.875 --> 38:06.000
that we have termites

38:06.083 --> 38:07.709
and that the chairs won't be there
until after we open,

38:07.792 --> 38:10.125
can I drown in self-pity then?

38:10.208 --> 38:13.458
Why haven't you told me
about all of this?

38:13.542 --> 38:16.166
Because I wanted to accomplish
something on my own.

38:16.250 --> 38:20.333
I'm the man. I shouldn't have to
run to my wife to bail me out.

38:20.417 --> 38:24.583
Gambling with our life savings
and not asking for help

38:24.667 --> 38:29.041
doesn't make you a man,
it makes you an idiot.

38:29.125 --> 38:31.125
Come on, Tom.
For God sakes, we are a team.

38:31.250 --> 38:33.166
And that restaurant
is a huge undertaking.

38:33.250 --> 38:34.709
No one could do it alone.

38:34.792 --> 38:38.000
You don't ask me for help
with your ad campaigns.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.667
I don't have to!

38:39.750 --> 38:43.375
You're always giving it to me.
Inspiring me.

38:43.458 --> 38:46.583
Remember the mouthwash jingle?
You came up with the hook.

38:46.667 --> 38:48.583
And what about the Bartlett campaign?

38:48.667 --> 38:51.917
Would I have ever come up with
tango dancing fleas? All you.

38:51.959 --> 38:54.041
There's nothing that I've accomplished

38:54.125 --> 38:56.500
that I could have done
without your help.

38:56.583 --> 38:58.667
Okay, fine. I help, we're a team.

38:58.750 --> 39:01.250
Just don't hit me again.

39:01.333 --> 39:04.125
So, tomorrow, first thing,
we'll fix the plumbing,

39:04.208 --> 39:06.709
we'll call an exterminator,
we'll rent some chairs,

39:06.792 --> 39:10.417
and we will open on time,
and it'll be a glorious success

39:10.500 --> 39:14.125
that you will have achieved
with my help.

39:14.208 --> 39:16.458
- Okay?
- Okay.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.291
And tonight I'm gonna
slap on some sex perfume

39:22.375 --> 39:26.083
and you're gonna get naked,
then we're gonna see who the man is.

39:27.375 --> 39:30.542
- God, I hope it's me.
- Oh, I'm sure it will be.

39:39.125 --> 39:41.458
Hey, Mom.
What are you doing out here?

39:44.125 --> 39:45.291
Oh.

39:47.083 --> 39:48.291
Okay, here's the thing...

39:48.375 --> 39:51.959
Don't worry. I'm not gonna get mad.
Just sit down.

40:00.083 --> 40:02.875
You know what upset me the most?

40:02.959 --> 40:06.583
That you didn't trust me enough
to tell me the truth.

40:06.667 --> 40:08.291
I tried to. You freaked out.

40:08.375 --> 40:12.250
Well, of course I freaked out.
I'm a parent.

40:12.333 --> 40:15.333
You know we hope that our children
will wait to have sex

40:15.375 --> 40:18.834
till after we're dead.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.375
And you wonder why I went to Edie.

40:20.458 --> 40:23.959
Okay, that's the other thing.
That cannot happen any more.

40:24.834 --> 40:28.208
You and I have always had
an amazing relationship.

40:30.041 --> 40:32.125
Let's not mess it up now.

40:33.208 --> 40:35.583
Okay. I'm sorry.

40:39.417 --> 40:44.125
Look, I know you think I'm too young,
but Austin and I are in love.

40:47.875 --> 40:49.041
Yeah.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.458
About that.

40:59.750 --> 41:03.709
God, I wish there was a pill that
you could take to protect your heart.

41:04.709 --> 41:06.291
What do you mean?

41:08.792 --> 41:12.166
Honey, I was over at Edie's today

41:12.250 --> 41:16.333
and I walked in the door...

41:16.417 --> 41:18.875
Yes, I need to speak to my husband.

41:20.709 --> 41:22.291
Yes, there is.

41:22.375 --> 41:27.333
Would you please ask him to come
home as early as possible tonight?

41:27.417 --> 41:28.792
Thank you.

41:32.834 --> 41:35.000
<i>It's a dangerous world.</i>

41:38.375 --> 41:41.000
<i>So we all look for protection.</i>

41:43.458 --> 41:46.792
<i>And whether we find it</i>
<i>in the arms of our mother,</i>

41:51.333 --> 41:54.250
<i>or at the end of a jagged blade,</i>

41:58.792 --> 42:01.417
<i>in the kiss of our sweetheart,</i>

42:05.291 --> 42:07.333
<i>or at the end of a barrel,</i>

42:08.458 --> 42:11.542
<i>we do what we have to, to feel safe.</i>

42:14.625 --> 42:18.166
<i>Because we know</i>
<i>somewhere in the world</i>

42:23.834 --> 42:26.834
<i>there are those</i>
<i>who would do us harm.</i>
