WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:09.422
I didn't know you owned a cottage.

00:11.800 --> 00:15.340
Why did you two never live there?

00:15.360 --> 00:19.184
I visited once,
but I never cared for it.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.182
Anyway, it was your grandfather's.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.194
It was really all very basic.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.951
Goodnight.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.185
Goodnight, dear.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

01:03.720 --> 01:06.429
My dear Flora, your photograph

01:06.440 --> 01:07.839
is getting pretty battered with

01:07.840 --> 01:11.824
all the travelling around
in my breast pocket.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.434
I can't tell you where we are

01:13.440 --> 01:15.796
or much of what we're doing, of course.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.276
Much of the countryside is so beautiful

01:18.280 --> 01:19.828
that I have to remind the men that

01:19.840 --> 01:21.912
we're not here on holiday.

01:21.920 --> 01:25.061
But then, merry hell breaks out again.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.196
I'll spare you the details.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.080
Aim at the olive groves,

01:36.120 --> 01:37.554
until the others get
through to relieve us.

01:37.560 --> 01:38.560
Yes sir!

01:40.200 --> 01:41.907
Bastards got the supply lorry

01:41.920 --> 01:43.149
before it could get through the gates, sir!

01:43.160 --> 01:46.108
It's the driver, sir - another dead one
and they shot out the tyres.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.754
Everybody out with the others, quickly!

01:56.800 --> 01:57.916
We need the MO!

01:57.920 --> 02:00.948
I think this one's still with us, sir!
- The MO's dead.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.076
Put him with the rest.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.080
Quickly!

02:07.920 --> 02:08.880
Not another!

02:08.881 --> 02:10.155
He was in the back with the supplies!

02:10.160 --> 02:11.389
Christ.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.073
Set him down gently.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.073
I need you back at the gatehouse.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.674
We can't have the others
ambushed, do you understand?

02:17.680 --> 02:18.600
Sir!

02:21.560 --> 02:24.314
Don't just sit there, help him!

02:36.360 --> 02:37.680
Sugar.

02:38.280 --> 02:41.467
Our lives full of bloody sugar.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.435
March.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.274
Thomas March!

02:48.000 --> 02:49.832
March, stay with me.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.075
Stay with me!

02:51.080 --> 02:52.080
March!

03:43.760 --> 03:45.080
Captain.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.630
You were lucky.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.746
Your lot saved my life.

03:57.520 --> 03:58.520
This...

03:59.680 --> 04:01.672
This was your lifesaver.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.712
I need to get your sketch pads

04:04.720 --> 04:08.339
back from our CO;
he's not exactly artistic.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.396
Berryman!

04:14.240 --> 04:16.903
Was I a beast to you at school?

04:16.920 --> 04:18.514
Berryman!

04:18.519 --> 04:22.060
Actually you were always very kind.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.434
What a relief.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.518
Berryman, a word.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.948
Yes, sir.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.426
- Almost! Left, left! Oi!
- Watch it, watch it!

04:42.440 --> 04:44.432
Come on, come on, get stuck in!

04:45.360 --> 04:48.547
â™ª I've got the joy, joy,
joy, joy down in my heart

04:48.560 --> 04:50.666
Who are you writing to?

04:51.480 --> 04:54.986
Oh, a girl back home, Flora.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.468
She's a teacher.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.274
Oh.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.350
I've known her all my life.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.342
She's almost like a sister.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.589
Not entirely.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.862
She lost her parents in an air raid.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.279
Just like me.

05:14.280 --> 05:18.104
Almost there...
Goal!

05:18.240 --> 05:19.435
Goal!

05:21.840 --> 05:23.434
Listen up, men.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.113
This is Captain March.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.827
He's an official war artist.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.547
Now you're not to mind him drawing you.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.074
His work is good for morale.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.150
Sir.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.028
Sir, is it true that the Hun lay
on tarts for their soldiers?

05:34.040 --> 05:37.625
Yeah, how come they get
tarts and we get artists?

05:37.640 --> 05:39.598
It's the morale back
home that art can raise.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.946
It's for your wives and
girlfriends, your children.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.280
Don't let them cheek you..

05:46.320 --> 05:47.320
Sir?

05:48.240 --> 05:49.240
Go on, sir.

05:51.080 --> 05:51.880
Paint me.

05:51.881 --> 05:53.155
Put it away, Bates.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.867
But he's raising my morale, sir.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.278
Bates will drive you to rendezvous point

06:06.280 --> 06:08.465
and then you'll be driven
back down to work from there.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.834
How far to the Handover?

06:09.840 --> 06:11.240
An hour at least.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.670
Depending on the state of the road.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.026
Well in that case, nature calls.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.476
Are we likely to come under fire?

06:19.480 --> 06:20.960
Hopefully not.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.504
Save fuel, men.
As you were, please.

06:28.640 --> 06:32.862
The area should have been cleared.

06:38.960 --> 06:42.272
It's bloody embarrassing, but I can't...

06:42.360 --> 06:44.750
button my fly single handed.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.352
Promise me that you'll come and find me?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.040
I mean it.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.630
Captain.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.040
Captain Berryman!

07:39.120 --> 07:40.236
You ought to be off, sir.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.824
Rendezvous time's not that long away.

07:42.840 --> 07:43.856
Of course Bates, good man.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.633
Thank you, Bates.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.718
Good luck.

08:15.841 --> 08:17.469
What's so amusing, Travis?

08:17.480 --> 08:19.552
Patroclus, miss.

08:19.560 --> 08:23.828
Patroclus and Achilles,
I don't understand.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.991
Your closest friend
is butchered in a battle

08:26.000 --> 08:27.116
in which he wore your armour

08:27.120 --> 08:28.827
because you disdained to fight.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.274
You lament.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.908
Perfectly understandable.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.196
But they're not just friends are they?

08:36.320 --> 08:39.427
Greek for friendship? Wickham?

08:39.440 --> 08:40.510
Agape, miss.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.868
Love between heroes was regarded

08:42.880 --> 08:45.430
as surpassing the love between marriage,

08:45.440 --> 08:47.175
but, in Sparta's...

08:48.920 --> 08:49.956
Class rise.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.184
Miss Talbot, boys.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.953
We have just heard that Mr Churchill

08:56.960 --> 08:59.828
has accepted Germany's surrender.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.424
The war in Europe is at an end.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.233
You may cheer, boys.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.234
No more bloody war!

09:59.160 --> 10:00.355
Hello.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.467
Are you lost?

10:04.480 --> 10:07.621
I was looking for Captain March.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.074
Perhaps I have his address wrong.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.106
No, no, he has the studio upstairs.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.038
We share an entrance.

10:13.920 --> 10:14.920
Oh.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.267
I don't bite, unless you pay extra.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.780
I'm Lucian: landlord, watchdog,

10:24.800 --> 10:27.463
purveyor of shade to the gentry.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.799
Who are you?

10:30.800 --> 10:34.112
My name is Berryman, Michael Berryman.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.831
Enter, Michael Berryman.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.310
You came.

11:16.880 --> 11:21.023
We were only demobbed
from Colchester this morning.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.836
If it's not convenient...

11:26.080 --> 11:27.275
Don't be silly. Its...

11:38.160 --> 11:39.160
Er...

12:11.320 --> 12:13.232
So what are your plans?

12:14.240 --> 12:16.312
For the rest of the evening?

12:16.440 --> 12:18.910
Bugger all.

12:18.960 --> 12:19.960
Good.

12:21.280 --> 12:22.350
What about...

12:23.600 --> 12:26.787
Sorry, I've forgotten her name.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.800
Flora.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.715
Flora Talbot.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.944
She doesn't know I'm back yet.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.080
Left here.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.035
Left!

13:29.840 --> 13:33.459
I haven't been here
since my parents died.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.353
I should've written.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.430
I'm a coward.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.194
I wrote to you in my head
every bloody day but I...

14:25.200 --> 14:26.600
I wrote to you.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.320
Really?

14:32.920 --> 14:34.992
Nothing ever got through.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.830
I never said I posted them.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.080
Tea!

15:12.960 --> 15:14.030
Very old tea.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.150
Fuck, the floor is cold.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.600
I also found...

15:22.320 --> 15:24.983
an unopened tin of shortbread.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.912
It must be pre-war.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.112
Good morning March.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.120
Captain.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.354
Thank you so much.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.584
You haven't mentioned her all week.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.193
It's scarcely appropriate.

16:58.194 --> 16:59.787
Do you love her?

16:59.840 --> 17:01.354
I...

17:02.520 --> 17:04.352
You'll love her too.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.236
How cosy.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.515
Please, Thomas.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.068
I don't understand how you can be

17:12.079 --> 17:13.560
so matter of fact.

17:14.839 --> 17:16.319
Does she love you?

17:17.440 --> 17:18.874
I imagine so or she wouldn't have

17:18.880 --> 17:20.473
agreed to marry me.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.912
Please say yes, Thomas.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.798
Say you'll be there at least please.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.758
I have no family.

17:29.760 --> 17:33.072
I don't want to be your bloody family.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.040
I...

17:48.720 --> 17:49.720
Please.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.190
You have no idea have you?

18:04.040 --> 18:05.713
What about, Thomas?

18:07.320 --> 18:08.280
You surely didn't think that we could

18:08.281 --> 18:10.465
set up house together like man and wife.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.480
Please.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.670
Just be quiet.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.350
Let's just go back to London.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.832
Nearly there.

18:32.840 --> 18:35.822
I'm so glad you wore Mummy's brooch.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.434
Bloody hell.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.147
You are not to cry.

18:49.080 --> 18:49.760
Oh, there he is.

18:49.761 --> 18:50.761
Thomas!

18:57.240 --> 18:58.674
Hello.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.520
You must be...

18:59.521 --> 19:01.035
Daphne, older sister.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.668
Matron of honour and all that.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.433
Thomas March, how do you do?

19:04.440 --> 19:07.069
Michael says you're an
artist. How very romantic.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.434
Hardly.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.954
Flora, how do you do?

19:09.960 --> 19:10.880
Hello, Thomas.

19:10.881 --> 19:12.587
You look wonderful.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.520
Worth the wait.

19:13.521 --> 19:14.749
Thank you.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.548
Sorry that I couldn't
come to your supper party.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.588
I'm horribly unsociable
when I'm working.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.432
Talking of which.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.944
I brought you something,
a wedding present.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.589
That's so sweet.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.400
We should probably...

19:28.401 --> 19:29.239
Yes.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.240
Michael.
- Yes.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.429
You came.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.914
Of course I came.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.916
Fucking best man has to.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.063
If any man or woman knows just cause

19:49.080 --> 19:52.904
or impediment why these two
should not be joined together

19:52.920 --> 19:56.630
let him now speak or else hereafter

19:56.640 --> 19:58.825
forever hold his peace.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.638
Do you, Michael Sadler Berryman,

20:03.640 --> 20:06.076
take Flora Agnes Talbot to be

20:06.080 --> 20:07.434
your wedded wife?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.034
I do.

20:13.680 --> 20:17.743
It seems wrong
having no one in tears.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.554
I don't think we...

20:30.560 --> 20:32.996
Compliments of Mr March, sir.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.834
Thomas, you shouldn't have.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.390
You can't get married
and not have bubbles.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.400
Thank you.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.553
Thank you.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.039
So,

20:45.040 --> 20:46.668
the bride and groom.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.908
Bless you, Thomas.

20:50.920 --> 20:54.585
Please, no speeches
anyone, or I shall cry.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.747
You're really not having a honeymoon?

20:58.760 --> 21:00.194
We haven't a bean until Michael's

21:00.200 --> 21:01.634
salary from the bank comes through.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.040
We used pretty much all of our savings

21:03.041 --> 21:04.838
on a deposit for the flat.

21:04.840 --> 21:08.152
So not even a weekend in your cottage?

21:08.160 --> 21:09.160
Oh...

21:09.680 --> 21:10.999
Oh, dear.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.141
Not until it has a boiler, a new bathroom,

21:14.160 --> 21:15.310
and no mice.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.423
The flat is darling
though, right on the park.

21:20.440 --> 21:21.556
You must come for supper.

21:21.560 --> 21:22.994
Yes, you must.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.707
Apparently, Thomas's pad in Soho

21:24.720 --> 21:27.304
was unreconstructed Hogarth.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.754
How marvellous.

21:28.760 --> 21:29.989
Not really.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.436
So, won't you miss your teaching?

21:32.440 --> 21:33.280
Hardly.

21:33.281 --> 21:36.195
All those dirty-minded little boys.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.199
Ahh, food.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.395
Daphne could eat a horse.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.068
Naughty.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.899
Thanks so much Thomas, for everything.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.070
You, er...

22:00.320 --> 22:02.152
You've been brilliant.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.480
Haven't I?

22:08.960 --> 22:10.030
Thomas I...

22:20.480 --> 22:21.480
Thomas I, er...

22:24.880 --> 22:25.720
I really...

22:25.721 --> 22:27.155
What?

22:27.160 --> 22:29.232
What, what do you really?

22:30.600 --> 22:31.600
I just...

22:54.560 --> 22:56.392
Just give us a bloody minute will you?!

22:56.400 --> 22:57.400
Of course.

23:13.760 --> 23:18.540
You don't have to go through with this.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.830
Of course I do.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.822
If you have either sense or decency,

23:25.840 --> 23:27.388
you'll do the same.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.596
Well, I'll go and settle up.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.273
You're perfection.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.592
I feel a bit of a fraud.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.716
Oh, darling.

23:56.920 --> 23:58.752
You'll be fine.

23:58.760 --> 23:59.760
You'll see.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.078
I bet he's a real goer.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.436
But sensitive with it.

24:06.440 --> 24:07.440
It's...

24:11.160 --> 24:12.160
What?

24:13.440 --> 24:14.440
Tell me.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.954
It's a lot nicer if
he lets you ride up top.

24:55.480 --> 24:58.234
I'm told it gets better.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.240
Yes.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.600
I heard that too.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.034
Mrs Berryman.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.988
Actually, do you mind just...

25:17.000 --> 25:18.832
Oh, of course, sorry.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.749
Now if I snore,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.310
you're to throw a book at me.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.275
Goodnight.

25:36.276 --> 25:37.280
Goodnight.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.598
Back to work, Berryman.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.073
So who else should we invite?

26:02.080 --> 26:04.186
If we simply have Daphne and
this new chap of hers.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.716
Poor man will feel he's being auditioned.

26:06.720 --> 26:07.915
Well isn't he?

26:07.920 --> 26:10.151
She rather implied she'd
already auditioned him

26:10.160 --> 26:12.914
and he'd passed with flying colours.

26:15.880 --> 26:16.950
Sorry, what was that?

26:16.960 --> 26:18.508
I was miles away.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.752
I said who else should we invite?

26:21.760 --> 26:23.752
Well I ran into Richard Tremayne

26:23.760 --> 26:24.830
at Blackfriars the other day.

26:24.840 --> 26:25.990
You know, from the regiment.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.116
We could have him and his wife.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.668
What about poor Thomas?

26:28.680 --> 26:30.039
We haven't seen him since the wedding.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.399
Daphne thought he was a bit of all right

26:31.400 --> 26:35.270
and he has all sorts of eager
spinsters lined up for him.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.192
No, I don't think so.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.748
Why ever not?

26:38.760 --> 26:40.911
Well he's not terribly sociable really.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.149
He'd only be a dead weight.

26:42.160 --> 26:45.700
And you can tell Daphne
he's a confirmed bachelor.

26:45.720 --> 26:49.624
She'd only take that
as a personal challenge.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.000
Daphne.

28:52.001 --> 28:54.151
Thank God, I'm starving.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.040
Me too.

28:56.041 --> 28:57.669
Oh, of course you are!

28:57.680 --> 29:00.787
My darling, how many weeks to go?

29:00.800 --> 29:02.075
Two or three.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.119
Ooh.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.988
Let's find you a nice bench.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.834
Such a drama this morning.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.547
Phil Gladstone.

29:10.560 --> 29:11.518
Which is he?

29:11.520 --> 29:13.796
Victorian watercolours and china.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.507
Lives with his mother.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.661
He was arrested
first thing this morning.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.308
No, why?

29:20.320 --> 29:22.312
It turns out he was also living

29:22.320 --> 29:24.676
with the man upstairs.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.911
One of their neighbours had sneaked

29:26.920 --> 29:28.354
and the police showed up at dawn

29:28.360 --> 29:31.274
and caught them together, in bed.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.511
Will he go to prison?

29:33.520 --> 29:34.919
Almost certainly.

29:34.920 --> 29:38.664
And Bill has a prior
history of gross indecency.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.000
Which isn't as bad as buggery

29:40.001 --> 29:42.470
but it's almost as bad.

29:42.480 --> 29:46.464
No more handling Lady
Downing's bristols for him.

29:58.280 --> 30:02.662
Gross indecency; you mean...
exposing himself?

30:02.680 --> 30:04.478
No, you know.

30:04.480 --> 30:06.187
Public lavatories.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.200
Oh.

30:08.520 --> 30:13.414
Now darling, tell. You sounded
all shaky when you rang.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.113
I was quite worried.

30:18.480 --> 30:19.914
It was nothing.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.514
Hormones running riot, probably.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.354
Making me feel like a caged beast.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.113
It is good to see you.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.784
You know you can tell me.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.758
You can tell me anything.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.760
I know.

30:33.520 --> 30:35.592
But, it's nothing.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.114
Everything's fine.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.268
Well, this is nice.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.119
I'm sorry.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.192
Darling, I was miles away.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.589
And you've gone to so much trouble

31:03.600 --> 31:05.353
and in your condition.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.908
Time on my hands.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.943
I tidied your desk this morning.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.714
Why?

31:13.720 --> 31:17.988
I needed some ink and it
was full of junk in there.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.506
Hope I didn't throw out anything precious.

31:24.080 --> 31:27.620
Well, I'm a hoarder.
You'll reform me yet.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.790
Where's Thomas's painting?

31:33.840 --> 31:36.754
I took it down, I rather hate it.

31:40.520 --> 31:41.670
Well perhaps I could take it to

31:41.680 --> 31:42.518
the cottage so you...

31:42.520 --> 31:46.708
Your precious cottage,
you'd love that wouldn't you?

31:47.920 --> 31:50.583
Pudding's only pears, I'm afraid.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.794
Oh, God.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.431
Take this fucking thing.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.120
What should I...

32:12.121 --> 32:13.349
I don't want it under
our roof another night,

32:13.360 --> 32:14.510
it's repellent.

32:14.520 --> 32:14.998
Yes.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.514
I mean, what are you?

32:16.520 --> 32:17.839
Are you safe around children?

32:17.840 --> 32:19.752
What were you thinking marrying me?!

32:19.760 --> 32:21.672
Do you even love me?!

32:21.680 --> 32:23.990
If I'm expected to lie
around bringing forth

32:24.000 --> 32:27.665
like some brood mare,
while the two of you...

32:28.400 --> 32:28.998
Ah..!

32:29.000 --> 32:30.354
Darling, darling, sit down.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.760
Don't touch me!

32:32.760 --> 32:33.830
Never touch me!

32:33.840 --> 32:35.194
You're disgusting!

32:35.200 --> 32:36.200
Criminal!

32:50.960 --> 32:51.960
Mr Berryman.

32:51.961 --> 32:53.987
Oh, thank God.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.434
It's this way.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.669
You came just in time.

33:01.360 --> 33:04.467
Go and have a drink, Mr Berryman.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.711
It'll be hours yet.

33:06.720 --> 33:10.260
And it's all woman's
work from here on in.

34:21.719 --> 34:23.598
Ooh..! So sorry.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.320
Let me put those in water.

34:48.321 --> 34:49.321
Thank you.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.672
There's not much on
offer this time of year,

34:56.679 --> 34:58.000
even in Covent Garden.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.552
You went all that way?

35:03.040 --> 35:05.954
They're lovely, I like white roses.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.238
He's sweet.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.993
A bit soon to tell.

35:17.600 --> 35:21.743
Eager feeder, though...
but it hurts like hell.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.666
I thought maybe Robert,
after your father.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.274
And James for mine.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.279
Darling, I'm so...

35:34.280 --> 35:37.786
I am far, far too tired to talk about it.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.436
Would you like to hold him?

35:46.720 --> 35:48.393
He's asleep.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.834
Perhaps we should just leave him.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.274
No, pick him up, please.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.536
I want the father of my child
- I really...

35:52.560 --> 35:54.996
to hold his son.

36:05.640 --> 36:06.835
Hold his head.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.795
So you like it?

36:32.320 --> 36:33.320
What?

36:34.080 --> 36:35.080
The name.

36:35.840 --> 36:36.910
Robert James.

36:39.440 --> 36:42.832
Yes, yes, it's perfect, perfect.

36:42.840 --> 36:44.638
Did you light a cigar?

36:44.640 --> 36:46.074
Certainly not.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.914
It took me several
weeks to track you down.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.514
How?

37:45.520 --> 37:48.980
Your boss and I go back a long long way.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.519
But he's...

37:51.520 --> 37:53.432
He's married with children.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.625
There's a lot of it about.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.793
Thomas is in prison.

38:02.440 --> 38:03.440
Why?

38:04.200 --> 38:05.634
The usual.

38:05.640 --> 38:06.640
Cottaging.

38:08.120 --> 38:11.580
Oh Christ, he really can pick 'em.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.353
Gross indecency, dear.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.839
One year.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.434
You must visit him.

38:17.720 --> 38:18.598
But...

38:18.600 --> 38:20.353
No buts - he needs you.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.590
What lies you tell are up to you.

38:25.600 --> 38:28.946
Though I'm told dentistry usually works.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.040
Why me?

38:37.080 --> 38:40.790
Because you could fuck, understand him,

38:40.800 --> 38:42.428
and meet the mother.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.632
You got under his skin.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.990
He loves you.

38:50.720 --> 38:51.720
Truly.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.914
Right, let's be havin' yer.

39:49.840 --> 39:52.822
I brought your pad and some charcoal.

39:59.160 --> 40:02.028
You look terrible, Thomas.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.588
It's prison food.

40:04.840 --> 40:06.160
Permanent trots.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.910
You look like a bank manager.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.560
How's...

40:20.840 --> 40:21.840
Flora?

40:23.760 --> 40:26.264
Yes, well, fine, fine.

40:27.560 --> 40:31.657
Though motherhood seems to
make her a little impatient.

40:31.680 --> 40:32.680
She...

40:36.040 --> 40:39.102
Baby boy arrived in November; Robert.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.280
Just make sure that she doesn't...

40:47.600 --> 40:50.787
...that she doesn't turn him into
a banker, too.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.716
I, um...

40:58.080 --> 41:00.265
We'd uh...

41:00.720 --> 41:04.544
We'd like to ask you to be his godfather.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.274
Once you get out.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.430
What on earth for?

41:10.440 --> 41:14.981
Well, whatever you
think of church or children,

41:16.280 --> 41:18.272
it's rather a good way to stay in touch

41:18.280 --> 41:20.511
with the people who matter.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.148
Don't visit again.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.552
- But, er...
- It's upsetting.

41:40.920 --> 41:41.920
Oh.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.998
Do something for me.

41:56.200 --> 41:59.626
I was at school with Thomas, Mrs March.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.548
I know who you are, Mr Berryman.

42:04.680 --> 42:05.680
How is he?

42:07.320 --> 42:08.320
He, er...

42:09.160 --> 42:11.516
He's, um, he's grown a beard.

42:12.520 --> 42:13.520
Hmm.

42:14.080 --> 42:17.540
His father did that once, for Ibsen.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.314
Does it suit him?

42:22.600 --> 42:24.273
Yes.

42:24.280 --> 42:25.280
Yes...

42:26.680 --> 42:28.911
He looks like a submariner.

42:30.760 --> 42:34.379
It's oddly like having
him back in boarding school.

42:34.400 --> 42:37.154
I was forbidden to visit there, too,

42:37.160 --> 42:39.311
in case I embarrassed him.

42:40.600 --> 42:44.424
Oh, you needn't look at
me with such sensitivity.

42:44.440 --> 42:48.503
I'm well aware of what he
did and why he's there.

43:03.960 --> 43:07.864
I've been storing them in his absence...

43:07.880 --> 43:12.023
rather than leave them
with that creature in Soho.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.906
I write him letters in soft pencil

43:18.920 --> 43:20.878
on one side of cartridge paper

43:20.880 --> 43:23.190
so he can draw on the other.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.954
Well, you should take this one.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.225
It's only a study.

43:35.240 --> 43:38.859
He must've sold the finished portrait.

43:38.880 --> 43:42.898
I call it Man In An Orange Shirt.

43:44.680 --> 43:46.512
But it's you, isn't it?

43:49.000 --> 43:49.840
Yes.

43:52.480 --> 43:54.358
So, you must take it.

43:54.360 --> 43:57.342
No, no, I couldn't possibly.

43:58.840 --> 44:02.027
I think it's wonderful, the colours.

44:02.040 --> 44:04.112
But, our... our flat is so tiny.

44:07.320 --> 44:08.320
Perhaps, um...

44:10.920 --> 44:13.105
perhaps just one of the notebooks.

44:13.120 --> 44:17.104
Oh, well, that one's damaged.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.120
Yes, but, er...

44:20.920 --> 44:23.390
I was there, you see.

44:32.880 --> 44:38.138
I have a very small house
in France, Mr Berryman.

44:40.120 --> 44:42.988
In a very small village in Cassis.

44:44.440 --> 44:47.706
You can go there when Thomas comes out.

44:48.960 --> 44:51.032
He can paint and you, you can...

44:52.440 --> 44:54.432
you can write something.

44:57.640 --> 45:00.702
That's very kind of you, Mrs March,
but, erm...

45:02.080 --> 45:04.436
he wants nothing more to do with me.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.876
Oh, that's just pride.

45:06.880 --> 45:09.384
And I have a wife and child.

45:16.280 --> 45:17.509
Is she happy?

45:18.840 --> 45:19.840
She's...

45:27.320 --> 45:29.392
I should be getting home.

46:02.640 --> 46:06.510
My darling Thomas, you refuse my visits so

46:06.520 --> 46:09.388
you're probably tearing up my letters, too.

46:09.400 --> 46:13.270
But there's nothing else
I can do but keep trying.

46:13.280 --> 46:16.148
It's beyond my control, do you see?

46:19.520 --> 46:22.946
All those months ago when I
had nothing to lose really,

46:22.960 --> 46:24.110
I wrote to you in my head,

46:24.120 --> 46:28.741
but was too cowardly to set
more than lies on paper.

46:28.760 --> 46:31.389
And now I find I no longer care.

46:33.760 --> 46:35.513
The love I feel for you

46:35.520 --> 46:39.026
runs through me like grain through wood.

46:39.040 --> 46:41.510
I love you Thomas, I love you.

46:42.840 --> 46:46.186
Your face, your voice, your touch

46:46.200 --> 46:48.158
enter my mind at the least
opportune moments

46:48.160 --> 46:51.586
and I find I have no
power to withstand them.

46:51.600 --> 46:52.670
No desire to.

46:54.760 --> 46:58.584
I want us to be together
as we were in the cottage.

46:58.600 --> 47:01.354
Only forever, not just a weekend.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.678
I want it to go on so long

47:04.680 --> 47:06.387
that it feels normal.

47:07.640 --> 47:10.702
I want to do all the
ordinary unbedroomy things

47:10.720 --> 47:12.951
we never got around to doing.

47:12.960 --> 47:15.270
Making toast, raking leaves,

47:16.640 --> 47:18.188
sitting in silence.

47:20.560 --> 47:22.074
I love you, Thomas.

47:23.440 --> 47:25.546
I've always loved you.

47:25.560 --> 47:26.789
I see that now.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.832
Tell me I'm not too late.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.553
There she is.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.916
Want to say hello.
- Oh, look.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.554
So solemn.

47:50.555 --> 47:51.909
So like his pa.

47:52.960 --> 47:56.272
I can't believe he's nearly one already.

47:57.200 --> 47:59.192
I say, not to worry about bridge tonight

47:59.200 --> 48:01.158
if Michael's away.

48:01.160 --> 48:02.833
Patrick can always take
me out somewhere instead.

48:02.840 --> 48:04.240
Oh, tonight?

48:04.241 --> 48:05.079
But he's...

48:05.080 --> 48:06.080
I was coming out
of South Ken on my way

48:06.081 --> 48:07.708
to Christie's this morning and I saw him

48:07.720 --> 48:10.429
striding towards the
train with his suitcase

48:10.440 --> 48:13.024
as well as the usual briefcase.

48:13.040 --> 48:14.439
Oh, yes.

48:14.440 --> 48:15.320
I'm such a dolt, darling.

48:15.321 --> 48:16.279
I completely forgot to tell you,

48:16.280 --> 48:19.387
he's got some dreary conference to go to.

48:19.440 --> 48:23.662
Banking, weather, you
know the sort of thing.

48:23.680 --> 48:24.816
Well, we can play when he's back.

48:27.200 --> 48:28.475
Are you all right?

48:30.920 --> 48:32.468
Fine.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.832
Oh, do hush, Robert.

48:35.840 --> 48:36.910
Oh, hush!

48:39.520 --> 48:40.874
For pity's sake!

48:55.920 --> 48:58.629
Hello, can you put me through to
Michael Berryman, please?

48:58.640 --> 48:59.360
Who's calling?

48:59.361 --> 49:01.433
It's his wife.

49:01.680 --> 49:04.184
Oh, of course, his wretched teeth.

49:04.200 --> 49:06.954
How stupid of me to have forgotten.

49:10.600 --> 49:11.600
Oh, stop it!

49:12.640 --> 49:13.598
I can't bear it!

49:13.600 --> 49:15.706
Stop it!

49:15.800 --> 49:16.916
Stop it!

49:24.040 --> 49:25.040
Sorry.

49:25.920 --> 49:28.663
I'm so sorry.

50:01.920 --> 50:03.400
Thomas..!

50:03.440 --> 50:05.944
Thomas, boy!

50:06.160 --> 50:07.120
How are you?

50:07.121 --> 50:08.271
Thomas! Oh.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.236
The key's in the cab, come on.

51:35.040 --> 51:36.360
Hello.

51:38.200 --> 51:39.200
Hello.

52:27.040 --> 52:27.998
I'll tell you anything you'd...

52:28.000 --> 52:29.992
I'd rather you didn't.

52:32.600 --> 52:33.795
I don't want a divorce.

52:33.800 --> 52:35.234
Please, Michael.

52:35.240 --> 52:38.632
It wouldn't be fair to Robert.

52:38.640 --> 52:41.781
But I don't want to make you wretched.

52:50.200 --> 52:52.112
I never want details.

52:53.240 --> 52:55.824
You must never get caught.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.593
We will never speak of it.

52:57.600 --> 52:58.520
Darling I...

52:58.521 --> 53:01.435
Please, don't you love me at all?

53:02.920 --> 53:04.320
Of course I do.

53:09.360 --> 53:11.113
I'm just the sister

53:12.320 --> 53:14.983
who happened to bear your child.

53:31.200 --> 53:32.998
I can live with that.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.558
Lovely morning, sir.

54:29.720 --> 54:31.473
Is all well?

54:31.480 --> 54:34.064
He wants to make an entrance.

54:35.080 --> 54:36.400
Ready?

54:36.480 --> 54:37.834
We can't wait.

54:42.240 --> 54:44.550
Stop laughing at me!

54:44.560 --> 54:46.472
Oh dear.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.984
Fortnum's will cheer him up.

54:50.680 --> 54:52.114
I just need to find the gents.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.954
We'll meet you down by the lifts.

54:56.640 --> 54:58.120
Robert, can I help?

55:19.040 --> 55:20.269
Sorry, sorry.

55:21.440 --> 55:22.954
Who's joining me on a bus to Fortnum's?

55:22.960 --> 55:23.798
Me!

55:23.800 --> 55:24.916
May I come too?

55:24.920 --> 55:26.548
Don't be silly.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.996
Michael, Flora.

55:32.560 --> 55:33.560
Thomas.

55:36.440 --> 55:37.988
How are you?

55:38.000 --> 55:39.753
Fine, fine.

55:39.760 --> 55:40.830
Stunning day.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.633
We've just been kitting
someone out for boarding school.

55:43.640 --> 55:45.438
So I'm bracing myself for a long afternoon

55:45.440 --> 55:46.919
sewing in name tapes.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.673
He can't be that age already.

55:48.680 --> 55:51.389
We haven't met Robert, I'm Thomas March.

55:51.400 --> 55:52.675
I knew your father when he wasn't

55:52.680 --> 55:54.672
much older than you are.

55:54.680 --> 55:57.992
Yes, yes, before I became respectable.

56:01.400 --> 56:03.278
So Thomas, you've been too long a stranger

56:03.280 --> 56:04.350
we must have you over.

56:04.360 --> 56:05.908
Yes, we must.

56:05.920 --> 56:08.708
I've not longed moved, to Cassis.

56:11.160 --> 56:12.389
To your mother's place?

56:12.400 --> 56:14.028
Yes, that's right.

56:16.200 --> 56:19.182
I'm just over for my new exhibition.

56:20.280 --> 56:22.192
It opens tonight.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.200
Oh, bother.

56:24.200 --> 56:26.909
Well, you could go along, darling.

56:29.320 --> 56:32.074
Well, no, it's Robert's
last night of freedom.

56:32.080 --> 56:34.994
I can't let you start
school without a present, hmm?

56:35.000 --> 56:36.070
Here.

56:36.080 --> 56:37.116
Thomas, you shouldn't...

56:37.120 --> 56:38.120
What do you say, Robert?

56:38.121 --> 56:39.441
Thank you, sir.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.230
Oh, that's our bus.

56:42.240 --> 56:43.435
Come along, Robert.

56:43.440 --> 56:44.715
Bye bye, Thomas.

56:55.880 --> 56:57.360
Goodbye, old man.

57:12.760 --> 57:14.114
I'll bag seats!

57:14.120 --> 57:15.120
We're not going that far.

57:15.121 --> 57:16.873
Oh, let him, this once.

57:16.880 --> 57:18.587
School's not that much fun.

57:18.600 --> 57:20.751
Two and a child to Piccadilly please.

57:20.760 --> 57:24.186
Two and a child to Piccadilly.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.160
There you go, sir.

57:25.161 --> 57:25.999
Thank you.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.399
Any more fares?

57:27.400 --> 57:31.304
He'll drink himself to
death in the sunshine.

57:33.200 --> 57:34.198
Probably.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.784
Is that where you were going?

57:37.920 --> 57:38.920
Yes.

57:52.360 --> 57:54.158
Look, they're really good ones.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.639
Goodness.

57:55.640 --> 57:57.393
Well, put them safely away
until we get home

57:57.400 --> 57:59.392
or you'll get all mucky.

58:03.160 --> 58:04.788
Don't fidget, Bob.

58:34.600 --> 58:36.273
To Flora and Michael, in the hope that

58:36.280 --> 58:39.592
the enclosed might one day
hang in your drawing room.

58:39.600 --> 58:40.600
Thomas.

58:42.160 --> 58:44.550
Who did you go with?

58:44.560 --> 58:46.552
A friend.

58:49.080 --> 58:51.436
He loved me,

58:51.440 --> 58:55.105
but he married me to
be like everybody else.

58:57.280 --> 58:58.430
This is so not okay.

58:58.440 --> 58:59.954
You're leaving a table of friends

58:59.960 --> 59:02.714
just to fuck a complete stranger.

59:03.960 --> 59:06.316
You're not even out, are you?

59:06.320 --> 59:09.666
I bet you've still not told your granny.
