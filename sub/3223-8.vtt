00:05.840 --> 00:09.003
You have no one at all, right?

00:09.160 --> 00:11.128
My husband.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.130
He died in Afghanistan
eight months ago.

00:16.760 --> 00:17.886
- Cass.
- Hello, Dean.

00:18.040 --> 00:20.725
Getting me out of purgatory
wasn't your responsibility.

00:20.880 --> 00:22.928
I pulled away. I needed to do penance.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.766
For the things I did on Earth
and in heaven.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.327
How the hell did you make it out?

00:29.840 --> 00:32.969
My name is Naomi. We rescued you.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.691
Consider these chats your repayment.

00:35.840 --> 00:39.731
You will report to me regularly,
and you will never remember having done so.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.765
Gary?

00:54.920 --> 00:56.604
Olivia.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.130
After last time,
I didn't think that you would come.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.970
I wasn't going to, but...

01:03.160 --> 01:04.446
I'm glad you did.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.361
So am I.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.121
Do you hear that?

01:14.080 --> 01:16.242
- What?
- The thumping noise.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.203
Is...? Is that you?

01:19.720 --> 01:20.767
You can hear that?

01:22.600 --> 01:23.965
Gary?

01:24.120 --> 01:25.201
- Ow.
- Gary.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.569
Gary, what is it? Wha...?

01:30.760 --> 01:32.728
Gary. Gary!

01:44.680 --> 01:47.251
Right, yeah. No, just, uh...

01:47.400 --> 01:50.927
Just call us whenever
you find something. Yeah.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.528
Yeah. Of course.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.284
Right, no, I, uh...

01:56.200 --> 01:58.168
Yeah. Hey, you know what?
Dean's here.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.482
He really wants to talk to you.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.327
Miss Tran, yeah, hi...

02:05.640 --> 02:07.165
Tunnel

02:07.520 --> 02:08.884
What's going on in Tran-Land?

02:09.039 --> 02:12.522
Garth, uh, got them to his houseboat,
but Kevin's having a lot of trouble...

02:12.680 --> 02:15.570
...reading their half of the tablet.
So far, bits and pieces.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.688
Nothing about boarding up hell.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.569
Garth has a safe-house boat?

02:19.720 --> 02:21.529
Dude, I don't even ask questions anymore.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.846
What's the word, Cass?

02:27.440 --> 02:29.488
It's a shortened version of my name.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.561
Yes, it is.
I meant what's the word on the Word?

02:33.720 --> 02:35.961
Any, uh, tablet chatter on angel radio?

02:36.440 --> 02:38.761
Oh, I couldn't say. I turned that off.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.730
- You can do that?
- It's blocking out subsonic frequencies.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.202
- I could draw a diagram if you want...
- No, that's... We're good.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.885
Why'd you flip the switch?

02:48.960 --> 02:51.008
Because it's a direct link to heaven.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.409
And I don't want anything to do
with that place. Not anymore.

02:57.080 --> 03:00.527
So, what now? Move to Vermont,
open up a charming B and B?

03:01.840 --> 03:04.047
No. I still want...

03:04.240 --> 03:06.242
I still need to help people.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.407
So I'm gonna become a hunter.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.245
- Really?
- Yeah. I could be your third wheel.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.527
- You know that's not a good thing?
- It is.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.041
A third wheel adds extra grip,
greater stability.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.247
I even found a case.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.607
Oklahoma City. A man's heart
jumped 1O feet out of his chest.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.127
It sounds like our kind of thing, right?

03:33.600 --> 03:35.090
- He's got a point.
- Excellent.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.924
- I'll see you there.
- Wait, Cass.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.323
Cass. You wanna play cowboys
and bloodsuckers, that's fine.

03:40.520 --> 03:44.764
But you're gonna stick with us.
None of this zapping around crap. Capiche?

03:44.920 --> 03:46.126
Yeah, I capiche.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.084
All right, then.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.443
Can I, uh, at least ride in the front seat?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.647
No.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.845
Coroner said his heart was ejected
from his body.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.566
Got some air too.
Found it in a sandbox.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.808
Any idea what happened, detective?

04:08.960 --> 04:12.601
A lot of people are thinking drugs,
Agent Nash. An assload of drugs.

04:12.760 --> 04:16.242
There are no narcotics in that man's
system. His molecules are all wrong.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.647
But you don't think that, huh?

04:18.839 --> 04:21.161
Never seen an eight ball do that.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.321
Wow.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.165
- Who called this in?
- Friend of his named Olivia Kopple.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.482
She saw the whole thing.

04:31.640 --> 04:35.167
Oh. Uh, I have to take this. Here's
everything we got. Knock yourself out.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.482
- Thanks.
- Listen, you see anything weird...

04:37.640 --> 04:40.120
...anything out of the box,
you just call me.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.163
Whatever you say, Scully.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.162
Detective Glass. On my way.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.323
I can't sense any EMF or sulfur.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.884
Mr. Frieling's arterial
health is excellent.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.644
Hmm.

04:57.800 --> 05:01.122
He did recently suffer from a mild, uh...

05:01.320 --> 05:02.845
What is that?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.651
- Bladder infection.
- Cass, stop smelling the dead guy.

05:05.800 --> 05:09.407
Why? Now I know everything
about this man. So we can...

05:09.560 --> 05:11.642
Do you know he was having an affair?

05:12.600 --> 05:15.046
- What?
- Strike one, Sherlock.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.966
According to Olivia, they would meet
at the park every Thursday at 12:45...

05:19.120 --> 05:23.523
...walk to the Moonlight Diner, where she
ordered a salad, dressing on the side.

05:23.680 --> 05:27.287
They would chat about everything,
and she'd be back on the road by 1:30.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.566
- You don't think she's telling the truth.
- Too much detail. Sounds rehearsed.

05:32.720 --> 05:36.770
Plus, we drove past the Moonlight Diner
on the way into town.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.922
It's attached to the Moonlight Motel.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.202
Okay, well, let's say
that Gary here's on the prowl...

05:43.400 --> 05:47.724
...but he's playing it
safe because, ha, ha...

05:48.040 --> 05:50.850
Dude's married.
Doesn't want anyone to see his ride...

05:51.000 --> 05:53.321
...parked out in front
of a by-the-hour fleabag.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.689
He stashes his car at the park
across the street, meets Olivia.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.730
- Wife found out. It broke her heart.
- So she breaks his.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.727
- Sounds witchy.
- Yes, it does.

06:02.920 --> 06:06.925
Heh. Guy was living a lie.
It came back to bite him in the ticker.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.969
But nice job on the bladder infection.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.922
He said he'd be here by 5.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.485
Uh, just deep breath.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.603
- It's gonna be okay.
- I know.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.445
It's just this house, you.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.489
He's gonna think
we're moving too fast.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.130
Are we moving too fast?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.645
We're making up for lost time.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.845
Don't talk politics.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.287
Don't say anything bad
about the Cowboys.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.811
And whatever you do, don't.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.281
Do not use the words "moist"
or "irregardless."

07:09.920 --> 07:10.967
There goes my opener.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.164
Hi, Dad!

07:16.320 --> 07:18.288
Oh, munchkin!

07:18.440 --> 07:19.805
Okay, embarrassing.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.810
That is my job, kiddo.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.764
So who's this handsome fella?

07:26.320 --> 07:29.005
Yeah, he's a good boy.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.208
How you doing there?
You're beautiful.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.840
That good boy
belongs to this good boy.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.044
Stan Thompson,
this is Sam Winchester.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.289
- Hi. I heard a lot about you.
- Not all bad, I hope.

07:43.160 --> 07:47.006
So this is a nice place.
Lawn could use a mow.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.526
Sam found it.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.400
I've been so busy lately.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.484
He's had to move us in by himself,
pretty much.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.367
Job almost well done.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.811
Do you want a drink, Dad?

07:59.960 --> 08:02.804
- We have beer, iced tea...
- Anything cold will be fantastic.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.367
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Okay.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.362
Mr. Thompson, um, I just...

08:10.680 --> 08:13.650
I know this must be weird.
You haven't seen Amelia in months.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.002
Now she's living with a guy
you've never met.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.003
Ame said you went to Stanford.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.491
- I did.
- It's a good school.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.205
- It is.
- So, what do you do now?

08:22.360 --> 08:24.124
I work at a motel in town.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.645
Ah.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.450
Balancing the books? Heh.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.329
Uh, no. Maintenance mostly.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.006
Ah.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.326
Well, that makes sense.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.609
Because I gotta say, Sam,
you look like a real fixer-upper to me.

08:45.080 --> 08:49.085
I don't understand. Gary had a
heart attack. Why would the FBI...?

08:49.240 --> 08:52.528
Parks are government property.
We just got a few questions for you.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.406
I'll, uh...

08:55.560 --> 08:59.087
I'll handle this. I've done research.
I can crack her.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.846
Now, Miss Frieling.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.766
I don't wanna bother you.
I really don't.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.720
But I do have just one question for you.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.042
- Why did you kill your husband?
- Agent Stills. A word, please.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.647
What?

09:16.040 --> 09:18.566
- I was being bad cop.
- You were being bad everything.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.486
Please, forgive my partner.
He's, uh, going through some stuff.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.927
- Listen to Sam.
- What he was trying to ask is...

09:25.120 --> 09:29.125
...is there any way Gary might
have had secrets?

09:29.280 --> 09:30.441
Something he was hiding?

09:30.960 --> 09:32.962
Hiding? Like what?

09:36.440 --> 09:38.124
Deb?

09:39.640 --> 09:42.086
- Olivia.
- Hey.

09:42.640 --> 09:43.766
Are you okay?

09:43.920 --> 09:45.285
As in mistress Olivia?

09:45.440 --> 09:46.805
This is awkward.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.601
I'm sorry.
What did you think Gary was hiding?

09:52.120 --> 09:54.088
That he was sleeping with her.

09:57.920 --> 10:00.446
- Ahem.
- I know.

10:02.480 --> 10:03.845
You know?

10:04.040 --> 10:05.166
Gary and I...

10:06.480 --> 10:09.450
We had an arrangement.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.490
He was seeing Olivia...

10:11.640 --> 10:15.281
...and I was spending some time
with our neighbor PJ.

10:16.640 --> 10:20.929
- Ahem. I'll put this in the kitchen. Yeah.
- I'll help. Okay.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.730
- Friggin' suburbs, man.
- So she's not a witch.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.684
Just the best wife ever.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.326
- Then what killed her husband?
- Who gives a...?

10:55.680 --> 10:57.045
It's a miracle!

10:59.000 --> 11:00.365
God wants me to live!

11:17.600 --> 11:18.886
Looks like suicide.

11:19.040 --> 11:22.567
It was. Guy left a note.
He invested everything in Roman Industries.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.849
- Lost it all when they crashed last year.
- So why call us?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.684
I have two witnesses who swear...

11:27.840 --> 11:31.242
...that Madoff here floated in midair
for a good 10 seconds...

11:31.400 --> 11:33.402
...then he looked down, and splat.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.242
Not sure, but the way they're talking,
sounds like straight out of...

11:37.400 --> 11:38.731
- Cartoon.
- Hey, detective.

11:38.920 --> 11:42.083
- You said you wanted weird.
- Thanks.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.809
- Yeah, what do you got?
- She's right.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.367
The whole heart jumping
out of the guy's chest...

11:47.560 --> 11:50.211
...the delayed fall,
that's straight-up Bugs Bunny.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.443
So we're looking for some sort
of insect-rabbit hybrid?

11:54.280 --> 11:56.442
- How do we kill it?
- No, we don't, Cass.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.809
That's a character,
like Woody Woodpecker or Daffy Duck.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.766
They're little animated movies.
You know, the coyote chases a roadrunner...

12:03.920 --> 12:07.242
...and then the anvil gets dropped
on his head.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.166
- Is it supposed to be funny?
- No.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.045
It's hilarious.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.370
Stay tuned, kids! We'll be right back!

12:17.760 --> 12:19.125
I understand.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.245
The bird represents God...

12:21.400 --> 12:25.041
...and coyote is man,
endlessly chasing the divine...

12:25.200 --> 12:27.009
...yet never able to catch him.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.766
It's hilarious.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.886
I got no idea what we're hunting.
Maybe it's a tulpa, some crazy god...

12:37.040 --> 12:40.089
...who watched
too much Robot Chicken. I...

12:40.240 --> 12:43.084
There a link between "Heartbreak Hotel"
and "Free Fallin'"'?

12:43.280 --> 12:44.441
Not that I can find.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.491
All right, well, I'm gonna call it.
Cass, you gonna book a room or what?

12:48.640 --> 12:49.926
No, I'll stay here.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.762
Okay.
Yeah, we'll have a slumber party...

12:52.920 --> 12:55.241
...braid Sam's hair.
Where are you gonna sleep?

12:55.960 --> 12:57.121
I don't sleep.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.804
- Okay, well, I need my four hours, so...
- I'll watch over you.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.165
That's not gonna happen.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.768
Something's coming across the police band.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.400
- Wait, you can hear that?
- It's all waves.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.125
A bank has been robbed.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.041
It sounds loony.

13:15.680 --> 13:16.920
Define loony.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.080
That's loony, all right.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.810
Agents.
I was just about to give you a ring.

13:26.600 --> 13:30.321
Gotta ask. Do you boys chase the crazy
or does the crazy chase you?

13:31.280 --> 13:33.169
- Depends on the day.
- Who's the pancake?

13:33.320 --> 13:35.800
Security guard.
He called in reporting a robbery.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.809
- By the time we got here...
- A robbery?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.480
Black Hole was trying to open
a safe deposit box...

13:40.640 --> 13:44.326
...when Mr. Rent-A-Cop found him and...
Well, you know how that story ends.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.331
Black Hole?

13:46.480 --> 13:48.847
Our name for a burglar
that's running us ragged.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.686
He's a pro. No fingerprints,
never any sign of forced entry.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.683
Just a pair of those every time.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.968
Like he's signing his work.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.644
Perp's never done anything
like this before, though. Obviously.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.963
You mind if I take a look at your files
on those other break-ins?

14:05.120 --> 14:08.010
No skin off my nose.
I'm headed to the station. Want a ride?

14:08.200 --> 14:09.486
Perfect.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.242
Hey. Can you lift this?

14:33.880 --> 14:36.201
X marks the spot.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.841
Whoever's doing this
is playing by cartoon rules.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.402
- Animation doesn't have rules.
- Sure it does. In Toontown...

14:42.560 --> 14:46.406
...a girl can make your heart leap out
of your chest, anvils fall from the sky.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.404
And if you draw a door
or a black hole on the wall...

14:49.560 --> 14:51.927
...you can stroll right through it.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.447
So this is how the thief got in.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.846
And out.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.850
And cracked the vault.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.850
Then why isn't it working now?

15:04.720 --> 15:06.085
I got no clue.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.203
Your father...

15:11.680 --> 15:13.808
Beautiful handwriting.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.600
How you feeling, Cass?

15:17.600 --> 15:19.250
Fine.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.086
Well, I just... I know that when...

15:24.040 --> 15:28.443
...I got puked out of purgatory,
it took me a few weeks to find my sea legs.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.285
I'm fine.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.887
Don't get me wrong.
I'm happy you're back.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.405
I'm friggin' thrilled.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.647
It's just this whole
mysterious-resurrection thing.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.326
It always has
one mother of a downside.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.291
- What do you want me to do?
- Maybe take a trip upstairs.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.966
- To heaven?
- Poke around, see if the God squad...

15:51.120 --> 15:53.600
- ...can't tell us how you got out.
- No.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.447
Look, man, I hate those flying-ass
monkeys just as much as you do, but...

15:59.640 --> 16:01.642
Dean! I said no!

16:17.160 --> 16:18.321
Talk to me.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.044
Dean, I...

16:25.840 --> 16:32.530
When I was bad
and I had all those things...

16:32.760 --> 16:36.367
...the Leviathans, writhing inside me...

16:38.000 --> 16:40.810
...I caused a lot of suffering
on Earth...

16:40.960 --> 16:43.531
...but I devastated heaven.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.490
I vaporized
thousands of my own kind...

16:46.640 --> 16:49.803
...and I can't go back.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.524
If you do, the angels will kill you.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.651
Because if I see what heaven's become,
what I...

16:59.040 --> 17:00.849
What I made of it...

17:01.640 --> 17:04.325
...I'm afraid I might kill myself.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.405
Hey.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.404
- Got something.
- Good.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.685
Excellent. What?

17:13.880 --> 17:16.359
So this Black Hole guy,
before he tried the bank...

17:16.520 --> 17:17.851
...he robbed a house.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.241
Across from the park
where Gary blew a gasket.

17:20.400 --> 17:24.723
So, what, you think the house heist
and Gary's corpse are connected?

17:24.880 --> 17:28.009
According to the file,
they happened at the exact same time.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.731
Here. Check this out. Okay.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.407
Here's the house,
and Gary died across the street here.

17:34.560 --> 17:38.087
That building from this morning,
right there. Black Hole hit that too.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.085
Let me guess. Where what's-his-name
took a swan dive.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.527
All right, I'll bite.
What about the others?

17:44.080 --> 17:47.209
Those are the places that stuff got stolen.
But nobody got dead.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.131
Take away the graffiti...

17:49.320 --> 17:52.403
...and these all look
like just normal smash-and-grabs.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.085
But I made a few phone calls...

17:54.240 --> 17:57.289
...talked to some people who were
nearby, neighbors and whatnot.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.728
- And they reported a whole lot of crazy.
- Like?

18:00.880 --> 18:03.884
Like a jogger bumping his head
and sprouting a 4-inch lump.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.771
Or a kid walking into a wall
and hearing birdies.

18:06.920 --> 18:10.606
For 50 yards around each robbery,
people were living in a cartoon.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.445
But it didn't last long.
Five, 10 minutes at each place.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.921
The time it would take a thief
to get in and out.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.926
Exactly. But whatever power he's using,
it's not targeted.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.084
I mean,
it's kind of like an area of effect.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.925
I mean,
picture him in a bubble of weird...

18:26.120 --> 18:29.442
...and anything that touches it
gets daffy.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.969
So this Animaniac can step
through walls, can toss an anvil?

18:34.120 --> 18:37.602
But he's warping reality to do it.
So if someone happens to be nearby...

18:37.800 --> 18:41.247
- ...meeting the girl of his dreams...
- His heart makes a break for it.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.449
Okay, so smashing the rent-a-cop,
that was on purpose...

18:44.640 --> 18:47.450
...but the rest of them,
is that just collateral weird?

18:47.640 --> 18:49.768
- Maybe.
- So we're looking for a thief.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.811
And the deposit box he was after.
Ahem. Now, the house, the office...

18:53.960 --> 18:56.486
...every place he's hit belonged
to someone living...

18:56.640 --> 18:58.483
...at the Sunset Fields
retirement home.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.961
- So you think our guy's there?
- Worth a shot.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.482
All right. Well, let's gear up.
It's "Wabbit" season.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.925
I don't think you
pronounced that correctly.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.849
- Come on, it's not that bad.
- Tell me this joint...

19:21.000 --> 19:23.048
...doesn't give you the heebs
and/or jeebs.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.850
- Hello. Can I help you?
- Hi.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.047
Yeah.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.643
Agent Crosby. FBI.

19:28.800 --> 19:32.043
Sorry, I'm Dr. Dwight Mahoney.
I run Sunset Fields.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.529
We need to question your residents.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.884
Well... Why? About What?

19:37.040 --> 19:39.520
Grand larceny, mostly.

19:41.360 --> 19:45.365
Of course. Ask away. If there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.046
- Appreciate it.
- Great.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.167
All right, let's do this.
No flirting, you two.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.886
You are so pretty, Charles.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.810
That's not my name.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.405
Oh!

20:04.560 --> 20:07.689
You look so much
like my third husband.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.207
We're here to talk
about the robbery, ma'am.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.600
Robbery?

20:13.760 --> 20:16.730
Mm-hm. The one the police talked to you
about a few days ago.

20:16.880 --> 20:20.202
Someone broke into your old house
and stole a stack of bearer bonds...

20:20.400 --> 20:23.051
...and some jewelry you stashed
under your floorboards.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.208
Oh, my diamonds, yes.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.124
I hid them there.

20:27.280 --> 20:30.363
I'm sorry, Charles. I didn't trust you.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.689
You were quite the bounder.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.929
Did you tell anyone
where your valuables were, Mrs. Tate?

20:37.720 --> 20:39.529
I don't think so.

20:39.680 --> 20:42.286
But then I get a little fuzzy
sometimes.

20:42.480 --> 20:46.405
Have you noticed anything strange lately?
Cold spots, smells?

20:48.000 --> 20:50.571
Well, there's the cat.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.290
The cat?

20:52.880 --> 20:54.211
He talks sometimes.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.124
Really hates that mouse.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.611
I'll interrogate the cat.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.449
You all done here?

21:07.760 --> 21:08.807
All right.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.762
It's creepy, right?

21:16.280 --> 21:20.285
A lot of these people, they just tune out
and live in their own heads.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.842
It's like maybe the real world
is too much for them...

21:24.040 --> 21:26.611
...and they just run and hide,
you know?

21:30.840 --> 21:31.887
Soup's on.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.408
And semi-edible.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.327
Ha, ha. You remembered.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.962
Dad was in the Army, so we moved
around a lot when I was a kid.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.851
Spaghetti and hot dogs,
our first night in a new house...

21:45.040 --> 21:48.283
- ...was sort of a tradition.
- All right. Got it.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.805
My father was in the Marines.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.961
- Jarhead, huh?
- That's right, 2nd battalion...

21:53.160 --> 21:54.810
...1st Marines, Echo company.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.842
I always thought
they were a little puffed up, myself.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.169
But, hey, what do I know?

22:02.320 --> 22:03.606
I'm just an old grunt.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.848
You're my old grunt.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.169
So Ame tells me you never served.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.522
- No.
- See, I find that hard to believe...

22:17.680 --> 22:20.968
...because I gotta say, Sam,
you got the look.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.327
- Look?
- The one guys get after they've been...

22:25.480 --> 22:30.361
...through the meat grinder. Lets you know
they've seen crap they can't forget.

22:30.520 --> 22:35.048
The second their feet hit solid ground,
they start running and they don't stop.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.728
Not till they find something
to hold on to.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.326
You think that's what I'm doing here?

22:40.480 --> 22:41.527
Just holding on?

22:45.320 --> 22:48.767
I think the two of you are holding on
to each other, yeah.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.363
Because I know she's scared.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.729
After what happened to Don,
I don't blame her for taking off.

22:54.880 --> 22:58.362
Needing to run away and hide.
I know why she did it.

22:58.920 --> 23:03.130
The question is
what are you running from, Sam?

23:08.520 --> 23:10.045
Hey, what do you got?

23:10.560 --> 23:15.521
Hey, um, nothing.
No hex bags, no EMF. You?

23:15.680 --> 23:19.082
Nada. Half the folks I talked to
don't even remember being robbed.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.210
Dean, um...

23:26.880 --> 23:30.362
Remember Fred Jones? A contact of
Dad's, lived outside of Salt Lake.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.364
Guy gave me my first beer.
Don't think I was double digits.

23:33.520 --> 23:36.444
Right, yeah. Me too.
Um, he was psychic, right?

23:36.680 --> 23:38.603
Psychokinetic. Why?

23:39.400 --> 23:42.927
Because he's in room 114.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.449
Cass. Let's go.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.200
I've almost cracked him.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.606
Now.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.287
Hey. I'm not through with you.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.171
Dumbass.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.091
Mr. Jones?

24:10.680 --> 24:14.002
Hey, it's, uh, Sam Winchester.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.404
Fred?

24:18.440 --> 24:21.489
My nerves! Get me a doctor!

24:21.640 --> 24:23.768
Fred. Hey.

24:25.800 --> 24:30.488
So you really think this one man
is causing all of these shenanigans?

24:30.640 --> 24:33.849
Well, if he is, he'd be surrounded
by a circle of crazy, right?

24:36.520 --> 24:38.249
Hang on.

24:49.640 --> 24:50.801
Bingo.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.726
But how?

24:53.880 --> 24:56.850
Fred's got juice.
An average psychokinetic can move things...

24:57.000 --> 25:01.005
...but a guy like Fred, you get him
worked up, he can reshape reality.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.162
- So where's his off switch?
- I don't know.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.687
I'm not even certain
if he knows we're here.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.683
Do we kill him?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.729
Excuse me, agents.

25:09.880 --> 25:12.531
Did he just threaten
to murder one of my patients?

25:15.560 --> 25:17.210
Real friggin' smooth.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.966
Well, we don't have to leave him.
I could teleport him.

25:20.160 --> 25:23.369
Fred's radioactive, Cass. You zap him,
no telling what will happen.

25:23.520 --> 25:26.490
Me and Sam will circle back tonight,
get Fred nice and clean.

25:26.640 --> 25:29.564
You go Invisible Girl
and keep an eye on him. You hear me?

25:33.200 --> 25:34.690
Good.

25:47.840 --> 25:48.921
Happy birthday, Sheila.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.890
- The birthday girl.
- Come on, Edmund.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.006
Help her blow the candles. Julia.

25:57.720 --> 26:00.200
- Make a wish.
- Not a day over 70.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.569
Good.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.207
Get ready. Big breath.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.209
- Happy birthday.
- Ready?

26:24.920 --> 26:27.764
I'm just gonna wipe this off for you,
okay?

26:28.080 --> 26:30.242
I'm just gonna put this on you.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.324
You got my message. Good.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.244
What the hell happened?

26:39.400 --> 26:42.449
- There was a pastry mishap.
- Okay, and?

26:42.600 --> 26:44.921
And the frosting reached
near supersonic speeds.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.645
- Hey. Fred's gone.
- Hey.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.126
- What?
- Fan-friggin-tastic.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.009
Way to take your eye off the ball.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.128
You're not supposed to be here.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.807
- Oh, trust me, you got bigger fish.
- Charles, she's wearing my diamonds.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.649
- Wait.
- What? What's wrong?

26:59.880 --> 27:01.450
This is Mrs. Tate's bracelet.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.165
Where did you get it?

27:04.880 --> 27:07.645
- Answer the question.
- My boyfriend gave it to me.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.970
Hey.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.689
Bearer bonds.
Maybe these belonged to Sheila Tate.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.680
- So this man is our thief.
- Yeah.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.044
Dean.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.005
Hey.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.724
Cass.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.685
- Stay still.
- What are you...?

27:53.840 --> 27:55.649
Move your hands.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.521
How did you...?

28:14.680 --> 28:16.682
- Guy eats his Wheaties. Come on.
- What...?

28:16.880 --> 28:19.042
- Get up, come on. Sit down.
- Wait a second.

28:19.200 --> 28:21.362
- What did you just do to me?
- Listen to me.

28:21.520 --> 28:24.364
- Where is Fred Jones?
- L... He took him.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.567
Who?

28:25.760 --> 28:28.366
Dr. Mahoney. That guy's evil, man, okay?

28:28.560 --> 28:31.689
- He's using Mr. Jones.
- How?

28:31.840 --> 28:34.161
All Fred does is watch cartoons,
but he is magic.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.563
A few weeks ago, I slammed my foot
in his door. I smashed it flat.

28:37.720 --> 28:41.042
When I shook the thing, it popped up.
Like something out of a cartoon.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.362
- Yeah, we know.
- So I told Dr. Mahoney...

28:43.520 --> 28:45.568
.and then he started
doing experiments.

28:45.720 --> 28:48.883
- We wanted to see what he could do.
- What about the robberies?

28:49.080 --> 28:52.721
Mahoney's skimming off Sunset Fields.
Lot of folks got stuff stashed away.

28:52.880 --> 28:53.961
Like off the books.

28:54.120 --> 28:57.442
Mahoney would track down the loot.
We would take Fred for a drive.

28:57.600 --> 29:01.082
Use his bubble of weird to rip people off.
How did you end up gut-shot?

29:01.240 --> 29:04.244
Mahoney. After he anvil-ed that guard,
he started freaking out.

29:04.400 --> 29:08.086
You showed up, and then the cake
blew in the day room, and he lost it.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.765
What does that mean, he lost it?

29:09.920 --> 29:12.924
He's on his way back to the bank
right now for one last score.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.561
Doc's blowing town.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.451
He said that Fred was a loose end.
He was gonna kill him.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.729
I like Fred. I said that if he
hurt the guy, I'd go to the cops.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.804
- And I didn't know that he had a gun.
- Okay.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.241
Do you think Mr. Jones knows
what's happening?

29:30.400 --> 29:34.564
I don't know. Seems to me like
the dude's living in a dream world.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.166
I am trying to help.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.841
And I'll tell you, if Don could see you...

29:50.040 --> 29:52.691
Don't. Just don't.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.644
You can't...

29:55.960 --> 29:58.281
- You need to come home.
- Is that why you're here?

29:58.480 --> 30:02.121
- To drag me back? This is my life.
- This... It won't last.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.970
You are living in a dream world.

30:04.120 --> 30:07.363
I like it here. I like this house.
I like Sam.

30:07.920 --> 30:08.967
Sam is a mess.

30:09.480 --> 30:10.641
I'm a mess.

30:11.640 --> 30:15.167
But when I'm with Sam,
I'm happy, Dad.

30:15.320 --> 30:17.607
And I haven't been happy
in a really long time.

30:18.560 --> 30:23.441
So please,
just, ugh, let us be messes together.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.887
Give us a chance.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.404
I'll dry.

30:50.960 --> 30:54.248
Is that your car outside? The Impala?

30:55.240 --> 30:56.651
Yeah, it was my dad's.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.646
Guy had good taste.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.486
For a jarhead.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.929
All right. Jones has gotta be close.

31:19.120 --> 31:22.249
I'll hit the bank.
You see if you can find him.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.404
Awesome.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.242
Can you feel that, Sam?

31:58.920 --> 32:00.729
The power.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.765
Calamity Jane, for you.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.046
Fred, hey.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.441
Fred. Hey, buddy. Hey.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.602
Hey, Fred? Listen to me.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.762
Can you hear me? Fred!

32:15.400 --> 32:16.811
If we could just talk to him.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.121
Hey, buddy.

32:18.280 --> 32:21.250
Hey, wake up. Wake up... Cass?

32:22.400 --> 32:23.765
Wait. Wait!

32:31.480 --> 32:33.005
Aha!

32:39.200 --> 32:40.964
Cass, uh...

32:41.120 --> 32:43.600
- Where are we?
- Inside Mr. Jones' mind.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.807
You said you wanted to talk to him.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.725
Who the hell are you?

32:52.440 --> 32:54.124
Fred. Fred, um...

32:54.320 --> 32:57.642
Hey, it's me. I'm, uh... I'm Sam.

32:57.800 --> 32:58.961
Sam Winchester.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.527
John's boy?

33:01.720 --> 33:03.802
- That's right.
- The scrawny one?

33:05.800 --> 33:07.962
It's only been three, four years...

33:08.120 --> 33:10.327
- ...since I've seen you. You...
- More like 20.

33:11.480 --> 33:15.530
Listen, Fred,
I'm gonna need you to focus.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.321
How did you...?

33:20.160 --> 33:22.049
Why are you here, Sam?

33:29.040 --> 33:31.008
What's up, doc?

33:31.160 --> 33:34.642
No, no, no. You're lying!

33:35.000 --> 33:38.527
This is happening, Mr. Jones.
They're using you.

33:38.680 --> 33:41.081
As what?
Some kind of a damn psychic coppertop?

33:42.320 --> 33:44.891
Plug me in, world goes wacky?
It doesn't work that way.

33:45.080 --> 33:48.482
How would you know?
No offense, but it seems to me...

33:48.640 --> 33:54.204
...like you've been spending more
time in here than you have out there.

33:56.360 --> 33:59.045
You wanna know what's the worst thing
that can happen...

33:59.200 --> 34:01.931
...to a guy who's got a mind
like I got?

34:04.040 --> 34:05.087
Losing it.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.042
You let me walk,
and half of this is yours.

34:14.159 --> 34:17.243
I'm gonna pass. I'm not into
stealing from sweet old ladies.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.370
I'm not stealing from them.
I'm stealing from their children.

34:20.520 --> 34:24.844
Bastards think they can drop their folks
off at a home, visit twice a year, maybe.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.368
I took care of all these old geezers.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.920
- I think I deserve...
- I don't care!

34:30.239 --> 34:31.730
Fine.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.206
Have it your way.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.409
Welcome to the fun house.

34:43.600 --> 34:47.730
Cartoons. I always loved them
when I was a kid. They made me feel...

34:48.080 --> 34:49.570
...happy, safe.

34:49.719 --> 34:50.926
They were...

34:51.080 --> 34:52.969
Something to hold on to.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.245
Yeah.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.610
Give up? I've been dealing
with this crazy for months.

35:20.800 --> 35:24.247
And you idiot bring a gun
to a gag fight.

35:24.400 --> 35:27.290
Yeah, well, I did bring this.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.086
And X marks the spot.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.331
I need you to stop this. Take control.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.970
It's too hard!

35:40.120 --> 35:42.771
Look, it can be nice
living in a dream world.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.490
It can be great, I know that.

35:44.640 --> 35:48.531
And you can hide, and you can pretend
all the crap out there doesn't exist...

35:48.680 --> 35:50.887
...but you can't do it forever...

35:51.120 --> 35:54.010
...because, eventually,
whatever it is you're running from...

35:54.160 --> 35:55.844
...it'll find you.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.651
It'll come along,
and it'll punch you in the gut.

35:58.840 --> 36:00.046
And then...

36:01.600 --> 36:03.204
Then you gotta wake up.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.164
Because if you don't...

36:05.320 --> 36:08.642
...then trying to keep that dream alive
will destroy you.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.481
It'll destroy everything.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.567
Looks like somebody turned off
the boob tube.

36:33.080 --> 36:34.161
Good.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.085
Means I can use this.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.530
No!

36:38.680 --> 36:42.651
You are never going to hurt anyone again.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.882
Well, that's all, folks.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.529
My God.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.720
Fred. You good?

37:15.960 --> 37:18.088
Now I'm good.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.641
In a month, a year...

37:22.480 --> 37:25.086
Nobody gets sharper with age.

37:26.560 --> 37:29.040
I mean, I'm gonna lose control again...

37:29.200 --> 37:31.202
...and somebody's gonna get hurt.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.089
Again.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.447
You gotta make it stop.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.608
There might be a way.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.766
The procedure will be painful...

37:46.000 --> 37:50.244
...and when it's over,
I'm not sure how much of you will be left.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.730
Well, what are you waiting for?

38:06.120 --> 38:07.804
Is he, uh...?

38:07.960 --> 38:09.724
Is he okay?

38:11.360 --> 38:13.408
He's listening to "Ode to Joy."

38:16.760 --> 38:18.205
He's happy.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.129
All right, well, let's
blow this termite terrace.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.129
Cass, you get to ride shotgun.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.322
- You done good.
- Thanks, but I, uh...

38:27.560 --> 38:29.085
I can't come.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.805
I, uh...

38:34.640 --> 38:35.801
Hello, Castiel.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.560
And no.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.161
No?

38:39.320 --> 38:42.005
I can see what you're thinking,
and I won't allow it.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.491
You don't understand.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.925
I have been trying to pretend that
I can escape what I did in heaven.

38:48.080 --> 38:50.321
But I can't.

38:50.840 --> 38:52.490
All that pain that I caused...

38:52.680 --> 38:54.682
I have to come back,
to make things right.

38:54.840 --> 38:58.162
And you are.
By doing what you're told.

38:58.680 --> 39:04.005
Bottom line, unless I ring my bell,
you stay out of heaven, Castiel.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.010
Well, then what should I do?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.604
What do you wanna do?

39:14.000 --> 39:17.209
You what, Cass?
Why can't you come with us?

39:18.200 --> 39:19.770
I, um...

39:22.080 --> 39:24.367
I wanna stay with Mr. Jones.

39:25.320 --> 39:29.120
Someone should watch over him
for a few days just to be safe.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.487
- Okay, and then what?
- Then I'm not sure.

39:34.160 --> 39:36.447
But I know I can't run anymore.

39:39.320 --> 39:41.687
So Ame is playing
the Sugar Plum Fairy.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.161
- Right, right?
- Now, this is her big moment.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.203
- She waddles onto the stage.
- Waddles?

39:46.400 --> 39:49.643
What? You were a chubby kid.
It was adorable.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.246
Anyway,
she waddles up onto the stage...

39:52.400 --> 39:55.483
...and she is dragging
2 feet of toilet paper behind her.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.926
No.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.769
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.561
Officially the end of her career.

40:04.720 --> 40:07.200
- You want one of these?
- Please, yeah.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.405
Thanks.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.004
My, uh...

40:16.880 --> 40:18.211
My brother used to do that.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.407
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:19.640 --> 40:21.324
- He a good guy?
- Yeah.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.442
Yeah, he was.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.921
The best. I, uh...

40:27.520 --> 40:31.730
I lost him, and I ran.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.601
I'm sorry to hear about that.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.241
What?

40:40.280 --> 40:42.442
Are you sure?

40:43.280 --> 40:44.406
Oh, God.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.284
Amelia?

40:58.280 --> 41:01.409
Baby? You okay?

41:03.360 --> 41:04.486
It's Don.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.166
He's alive.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.606
Sam, you with me?
