Colin!

00:41.000 --> 00:42.416
Colin, where is everybody?

00:46.291 --> 00:47.208
Hello?

00:48.208 --> 00:49.500
[bucket continues banging]

00:51.083 --> 00:51.833
Hello?

00:52.916 --> 00:55.083
I'm in need of lodgings
for the night!

00:55.208 --> 00:56.208
I'm a merchant.

00:56.875 --> 00:57.750
I can pay.

01:00.666 --> 01:01.541
Hello?

01:04.208 --> 01:05.625
-Hello!

-Not today.

02:16.541 --> 02:17.625
Please have mercy--

02:24.458 --> 02:26.166
Take him. Leave me be.

Please!

5,000 dead Kaedwenians,

03:11.500 --> 03:13.666
and at least 20,000 of theirs.

03:16.708 --> 03:18.583
You won't find her
in your visions.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.208
She's gone.

03:33.791 --> 03:34.541
Yennefer?

03:38.166 --> 03:38.958
Yennefer...

03:41.541 --> 03:44.000
Yennefer!

03:45.500 --> 03:46.583
[Geralt] Yennefer!

03:49.416 --> 03:51.041
[Roach whickers]

04:05.541 --> 04:06.458
I've seen this.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.750
Stay on the horse.

04:19.583 --> 04:20.583
Where is she?

04:22.416 --> 04:24.375
And who are you to her, exactly?

04:24.500 --> 04:25.500
Is she alive?

04:35.083 --> 04:36.833
We won. Because of her.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.250
She bought us time
until the armies arrived.

04:47.583 --> 04:48.458
Was it worth it?

05:01.166 --> 05:02.291
[grunts]

[Roach snorting]

05:13.083 --> 05:14.083
Yennefer.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.166
Can you please tell me
who she is?

05:17.291 --> 05:18.125
Doesn't matter.

05:19.958 --> 05:20.875
She's gone now.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.416
[Ciri shivering]

05:52.541 --> 05:53.375
Let me go.

05:55.833 --> 05:56.750
Let me go!

05:57.500 --> 05:58.708
[whimpering]

06:00.541 --> 06:02.416
[wind whistling]

06:16.583 --> 06:17.791
I sleep like shit too.

06:21.125 --> 06:22.250
You don't sleep at all.

06:24.291 --> 06:25.791
Makes for fewer nightmares.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.833
Except for the one
about the rock troll.

06:31.041 --> 06:32.000
Overly friendly.

06:34.958 --> 06:36.083
Tough image to shake.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.083
What about yours?

06:51.041 --> 06:53.041
The Black Knight has me
on his horse...

06:56.583 --> 06:57.958
Cintra is burning.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.625
I'm too helpless
to stop any of it.

07:07.083 --> 07:07.958
You escaped.

07:10.750 --> 07:11.708
I was lucky.

07:22.416 --> 07:25.166
I... need
to understand some things.

07:26.541 --> 07:28.416
You claimed the Law of Surprise
and got me.

07:29.041 --> 07:29.875
Why?

07:30.500 --> 07:31.916
It was payment for a debt.

07:32.791 --> 07:34.041
I saved your father's life.

07:35.166 --> 07:36.708
-From what?
-Your grandmother.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.458
She didn't want
your mother marrying a...

07:42.250 --> 07:43.208
an outsider.

07:52.333 --> 07:54.333
Your father didn't know
what he was giving up.

08:02.000 --> 08:02.750
So...

08:04.250 --> 08:05.291
I'm your destiny.

08:06.791 --> 08:09.166
-Whatever that means.
-You're much more
than that, Cirilla.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.083
-I miss my home.
-Cintra isn't safe
for you any more.

08:25.541 --> 08:28.541
Then what about Skellige?
I have people there too.

08:28.666 --> 08:30.041
-I'd be safe there.
-If you want.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.791
But you'd be married off
to the nearest
Lord of Bad Breath.

08:36.166 --> 08:38.166
He'd be seeking
to claim your throne too.

08:41.666 --> 08:43.125
The food is good there, though.

08:48.041 --> 08:49.750
[thunder rumbling]

09:03.500 --> 09:04.833
-[man yells] Fire!
-[gasping]

09:04.958 --> 09:07.041
[people shouting]

09:07.166 --> 09:08.416
-[man] Quickly!
-[woman] Over here!

09:10.416 --> 09:11.916
[man] I'm the only fuck in here!

09:14.041 --> 09:16.000
[yelling]

09:17.416 --> 09:18.500
[Artorius] Triss!

09:18.625 --> 09:20.416
-[Triss groaning]
-[Artorius] Stay with us!

09:21.125 --> 09:22.791
-[thunder crashes]
-Stay with us!

09:24.333 --> 09:26.708
-Triss!
-[moaning and sobbing]

09:26.833 --> 09:28.416
She was stable.
I don't know what happened.

09:28.541 --> 09:29.791
[grunting]

09:31.625 --> 09:33.208
[speaking in Elder]

09:33.333 --> 09:35.541
-[moaning]
-[rumbling]

09:35.666 --> 09:37.458
-We're losing her.
-[gasping]

09:37.583 --> 09:38.875
[both speaking in Elder]

09:41.166 --> 09:42.500
[groaning]

09:44.833 --> 09:46.500
[thunder rumbling]

09:46.625 --> 09:48.208
[panting]

09:49.416 --> 09:50.416
[heavy rainfall]

09:50.541 --> 09:52.000
Mmm. [gasps]

09:52.583 --> 09:53.416
[sighs]

09:54.250 --> 09:55.458
[thunder rumbling]

09:55.583 --> 09:57.208
[men groaning]

10:04.083 --> 10:06.083
-What is it?
-There is no sign of Yennefer.

10:07.750 --> 10:08.916
She's lost for good.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.625
And what of my niece?

10:12.750 --> 10:14.083
Fringilla was at the front.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.666
Coordinating
the Nilfgaardian attack
with the prisoner we took.

10:19.375 --> 10:22.750
She has abandoned
all rules of Chaos.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.250
She is lost too, then.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.916
Familial disgrace can wait.

10:28.708 --> 10:30.375
We need intelligence
from that prisoner now.

10:31.708 --> 10:35.166
The kings have their blood up.
They want to chase
Nilfgaard south.

10:35.291 --> 10:38.000
Perhaps we should,
since you'd have us
be warriors in the field

10:38.125 --> 10:41.291
-instead of advisers
in the palace.
-You weren't there, Artorius.

10:41.416 --> 10:43.416
We won. But barely.

10:44.375 --> 10:47.000
We do not know the troops
that Nilfgaard have in reserve,

10:47.125 --> 10:49.166
where they are reassembling,
what they are planning next.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.375
[sighs] The prisoner.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.250
What do we know?

10:55.375 --> 10:57.166
Our spies don't have much.

10:57.291 --> 10:59.833
Only that he orchestrated
the fall of Cintra.

10:59.958 --> 11:03.208
And that he doesn't answer
to the generals,
only to the emperor himself.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.041
No one's been able to break him.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.250
He will give us
everything we need...

11:09.375 --> 11:10.666
if I can have time with him.

11:14.916 --> 11:17.291
We have rules.

11:20.666 --> 11:22.583
She wasn't asking
your permission.

11:38.833 --> 11:39.958
[gasps]

11:45.625 --> 11:47.291
-[muffled] She's awake.
-[gasps]

11:52.958 --> 11:54.875
-[muffled] Welcome back.
-[Yennefer sighs]

11:55.000 --> 11:56.166
Wasn't sure you'd make it.

12:06.583 --> 12:07.583
[grunts]

12:08.250 --> 12:09.125
Fuck.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.791
[birdsong]

12:18.833 --> 12:20.583
[Ciri] So, what exactly
is Kaer Morhen?

12:22.500 --> 12:24.791
[Geralt] It's where witchers go
during the winter.

12:25.583 --> 12:28.958
There, we can rest up and heal.
Replace armor and elixirs.

12:30.666 --> 12:31.583
It's my home.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.083
How come I've never heard of it?

12:35.750 --> 12:37.166
Because we like it that way.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.000
Why?

12:41.875 --> 12:42.958
There was an attack.

12:43.833 --> 12:45.416
A long time ago,
when I was a boy.

12:46.458 --> 12:47.875
Almost wiped us all out.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.166
So now,
we like to keep a low profile.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.666
[Ciri] Hmm.

12:55.791 --> 12:58.041
In Cintra, I used to dress up
like a boy, just so I could play
knucklebones.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.041
[chuckles]

13:00.416 --> 13:02.166
We both need
to keep a low profile, it seems.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.125
[Roach snorts]

13:06.875 --> 13:08.791
Were you attacked
because you're different?

13:13.166 --> 13:16.333
Sure. We can't see the future
like you can.

13:20.833 --> 13:25.375
Back on the battlefield,
when you saw me and that woman
before it happened.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.166
Yes, well, it was...
it was more like a dream.

13:34.166 --> 13:35.125
Hazy. It was...

13:36.208 --> 13:36.916
it was weird.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.416
[neighs]

13:48.500 --> 13:49.541
[snorts]

14:04.833 --> 14:07.875

14:09.250 --> 14:10.250
Easy.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.958
-[neighs]
-[whooshing]

14:16.250 --> 14:17.416
How did you do that?

14:17.541 --> 14:18.750
It's called <i>axii.</i>

14:19.750 --> 14:20.916
It's a calming sign.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.250
Magic. Like... like a druid?

14:24.916 --> 14:25.833
Not really.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.625
[draws knife]

14:47.250 --> 14:48.250

14:51.291 --> 14:52.541
[screeching sound]

14:54.208 --> 14:55.666
[echoing screech]

15:01.958 --> 15:03.291
We should keep moving.

15:03.416 --> 15:05.333
[wind whistling]

15:12.666 --> 15:13.666
Oh, thank gods.

15:16.708 --> 15:17.875
Think there's an inn?

15:18.875 --> 15:20.041
Hmm.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.333
-Come on, Roach.
-[snorts]

15:22.916 --> 15:24.166

[bucket banging]

15:29.250 --> 15:30.541
[Geralt inhales]

15:33.333 --> 15:34.041
What is it?

15:34.916 --> 15:36.208
[Geralt] There are no guards.

15:37.666 --> 15:39.041
-[Ciri] Maybe hiding--
-[Geralt] Quiet.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.541
[bucket continues banging]

15:42.291 --> 15:43.875
There are no
barking dogs, either.

15:45.583 --> 15:46.875
This place never sleeps.

15:50.375 --> 15:53.208
-So what now?
-I know somewhere nearby.
An old friend.

15:54.583 --> 15:55.458
[animal shrieks]

16:01.833 --> 16:03.250
[animal shrieks]

16:11.666 --> 16:13.041
[Roach snorts]

16:23.083 --> 16:24.166
Stay on Roach.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.625
[crashing, men yelling]

16:34.375 --> 16:35.666
[neighing]

-[roaring]
-[mutters]

16:57.958 --> 16:58.875
Geralt!

17:01.333 --> 17:02.708
Nivellen?

17:02.833 --> 17:04.750
What the fuck
are you doing here,
you old whoreson?

17:06.290 --> 17:07.708
This is your friend?

17:07.833 --> 17:08.708
[Geralt] Yeah...

17:10.208 --> 17:12.125
-But he's changed.
-[Nivellen] I know.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.165
I look a tad different
since you saw me last.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.250
But I could say the same of you.

17:20.625 --> 17:23.790
Put away your knife and come in
out of the cold, Witcher.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.833
I'll tell you everything.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.290
Eh?

17:30.250 --> 17:31.208
[chuckles]

17:33.250 --> 17:34.750
A fire for my guests.

17:35.583 --> 17:37.000
And you, my dear...

17:38.875 --> 17:39.916
Ciri.

17:40.041 --> 17:42.791
Well, Ciri, what say you
to a hot bath

17:42.916 --> 17:45.000
to warm your frozen bones?

17:45.125 --> 17:46.541
Oh, I'd love one.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.125
-We're only staying
until the storm dies.
-Please.

17:49.250 --> 17:50.500
[Nivellen] Splendid.

17:50.625 --> 17:51.458
Bath!

17:53.416 --> 17:54.583
[laughs]

17:56.083 --> 17:57.333
[gasps]

17:57.458 --> 17:59.458
[Nivellen] You can bathe
in the next room.

17:59.583 --> 18:00.708
I'm fine.

18:00.833 --> 18:03.291
You, my friend,
are very far from fine.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.458
You reek of old horse.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.208
Part of my charm.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.625
You always were
a horse's arse, anyway.

18:10.333 --> 18:11.083
Doors!

18:13.958 --> 18:16.958
How long's it been? 13 winters
since we last saw each other?

18:17.083 --> 18:19.833
Nivellen, I'm not one to slight
the rite of hospitality,

18:21.166 --> 18:23.416
but I do need to know
that she's safe here.

18:23.541 --> 18:26.333
You see my tusks and think
I would... bite the throat?

18:29.750 --> 18:31.666
Hmm. She is.

18:33.916 --> 18:34.875
I'm still me.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.458
Well... Lights!

18:38.250 --> 18:40.625
-[laughs]
-That's not a bad trick.

18:41.791 --> 18:43.666
You gonna tell me
what happened to you?

18:43.791 --> 18:46.166
That's a tale requiring wine.
What of you?

18:47.208 --> 18:49.000
That's a tale
requiring a wine cellar.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.000
[Nivellen laughs]

18:52.666 --> 18:53.625
[chuckles]

18:57.750 --> 18:59.125
[light skittering sounds]

19:00.416 --> 19:01.958
-[creaking]
-[soft warbling]

19:05.166 --> 19:07.875
-[pattering and cooing]
-[Ciri gasps]

19:09.541 --> 19:11.500
[scratching]

19:31.291 --> 19:33.166
[creaking and tapping]

19:37.250 --> 19:39.083
[cooing]

19:40.291 --> 19:43.375
[Nivellen] Numbskull took
one look at the place,
tucked tail and ran so fast,

19:43.500 --> 19:45.250
his feet
didn't touch the ground.

19:45.375 --> 19:47.541
Brigands were tougher
in our days, eh? [chuckles]

19:49.833 --> 19:51.958
[Ciri] Thank you
so much for this.

19:52.083 --> 19:54.291
My other clothes were ready
to run away by themselves.

19:56.750 --> 19:58.125
But of course. Uh...

19:59.500 --> 20:00.458
You look lovely.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.875
[ringing sound]

20:07.000 --> 20:08.875
Roast venison, sage truffles,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.750
sweet wine, and lots of it!

20:11.833 --> 20:12.708
And for you,

20:13.500 --> 20:14.791
only the best.

20:14.916 --> 20:16.166
Witchers' quail.

20:17.791 --> 20:19.666
[laughs]

20:21.291 --> 20:22.416
That's a good one.

20:22.541 --> 20:23.875
[Nivellen] I jest, I jest!

20:24.000 --> 20:26.166
Mountain pheasant for my friend!

20:26.291 --> 20:28.541
[laughs]

20:29.541 --> 20:30.333
Ah!

20:34.375 --> 20:36.583
-Very good, eh?
-Mmm, very good indeed.

20:37.750 --> 20:40.250
-Has he told you
how we first met?
-No.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.750
He's not especially chatty.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.000
-[Nivellen] No.
-[Ciri] I'd like to hear,
though.

20:45.125 --> 20:49.041
It's my favorite tale. You see,
this snow-capped sourpuss here

20:50.041 --> 20:52.458
was hired by the most
horrible monster of all,

20:53.083 --> 20:54.333
my father,

20:54.458 --> 20:56.958
to clear our woods
of a wyvern infestation.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.833
-I've seen those in books.
-[Nivellen] Horrid creatures.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.500
See that weak
young whelp of a lad?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.250
That was me.

21:05.458 --> 21:07.625
And I tried to prove myself
to my father

21:08.583 --> 21:09.708
by killing one first.

21:10.958 --> 21:12.708
But instead... [chuckles]

21:12.833 --> 21:15.291
...I fell
into the damned beast's lair.

21:15.416 --> 21:18.291
This one pulls me up
by the scruff of my neck

21:18.416 --> 21:21.000
and slays the wyvern
snapping at my nethers.

21:22.625 --> 21:24.250
What do you think he does next?

21:25.708 --> 21:27.125
What?

21:27.250 --> 21:29.666
Gives me a hiding for being
such a cretinous twit? No.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.000
He hands me the wyvern's head

21:34.708 --> 21:37.541
and tells my father
I was the one that killed it.

21:43.208 --> 21:45.458
I had to clear the forest
of the entire pack.

21:45.583 --> 21:48.916
-Got paid either way.
-Nonsense! He's a big softie.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.375
I tell you no word of a lie,
young Ciri.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.375
It was the first
and last time...

21:55.541 --> 21:57.375
[sighs] ...I saw
my father proud of me.

21:58.708 --> 21:59.666
After that,

22:00.916 --> 22:05.125
Geralt and I became friends,
of a sort, over many a summer.

22:05.250 --> 22:08.166
Since we're telling no lies,
tell us about your curse.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.291
-In front of the girl?
-She's tougher than you think.

22:21.125 --> 22:23.875
[sighs] I was a gormless
young twat.

22:24.708 --> 22:25.625
That's how.

22:26.625 --> 22:27.875
Fell in with a bad lot.

22:30.791 --> 22:32.875
I trashed the Temple
of the Lionheaded Spider.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.791
High on godflesh mushrooms.

22:34.916 --> 22:37.666
All the mushrooms in the world
wouldn't make anyone
that stupid.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.208
[Nivellen] If only it was so.

22:40.875 --> 22:42.291
After the damage was done,

22:44.125 --> 22:47.208
this priestess cursed me
to live like this.

22:48.375 --> 22:49.166
Forever.

22:49.916 --> 22:50.750
Alone.

22:53.375 --> 22:54.333
Hmm.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.083
All curses have cures.
What did she say?

23:00.500 --> 23:02.333
She screamed something about

23:03.333 --> 23:04.250
love and blood.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
I don't remember.

23:10.458 --> 23:11.416
I'll be honest.

23:14.666 --> 23:16.250
I've tried to end it, Geralt.

23:18.625 --> 23:19.500
More than once.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.541
But I kept coming back.

23:24.666 --> 23:26.916
That priestess
won't let me off so easy.

23:32.916 --> 23:34.041
[sighs]

23:36.416 --> 23:38.250
The village below was abandoned.

23:39.958 --> 23:41.083
What happened there?

23:42.291 --> 23:43.875
After the Battle of Sodden,
the...

23:44.625 --> 23:46.708
countryside
is a dangerous place.

23:47.291 --> 23:49.375
Hungry soldiers, deserters...

23:50.916 --> 23:53.416
Not reason enough
for an entire village
to leave their homes.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.041
It is...

23:56.750 --> 23:59.041
when the Wild Hunt's
riding over the horizon.

24:00.333 --> 24:01.458
I saw them myself.

24:02.291 --> 24:03.125
Just last week.

24:04.458 --> 24:06.916
Riding their skeletal horses
across the southern sky.

24:07.708 --> 24:09.000
A portent of doom.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.333
The Wraiths of Mรถrhogg?

24:12.291 --> 24:14.208
My grandfather saw them
just before Cintra fell.

24:14.333 --> 24:15.541
Her grandfather was a drunk.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.500
He saw a lot of things.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.125
I'm simply saying,
the North and South at war,

24:24.250 --> 24:26.708
monsters roaming
when they should be hibernating,

24:26.833 --> 24:28.708
pestilence sweeping the land...

24:29.583 --> 24:31.541
Maybe it's the end of days.

24:31.666 --> 24:34.666
I've lived through
a whole dark age and three
supposed end of days.

24:35.541 --> 24:36.708
It's all horseshit.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.416
No, something
has changed, Geralt.

24:40.458 --> 24:43.500
The world's acting of its own
strange accord these days.

24:43.625 --> 24:46.166
-[scritching]
-Far outside the reach
of kings and men.

24:46.291 --> 24:47.958
[scratching and cooing]

24:49.416 --> 24:51.041
[Ciri] Nivellen,
do you have a cat?

24:51.958 --> 24:53.791
The poor thing
might be stuck in the ceiling.

24:53.916 --> 24:56.208
I do, in fact. She's fine.

24:57.250 --> 24:58.750
Vereena, she's called.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.625
I'm very glad of her company,

25:01.750 --> 25:03.625
even if she's a shy wee thing.

25:04.750 --> 25:05.833
Not fond of strangers.

25:07.208 --> 25:09.416
Didn't you say
you were cursed to live alone?

25:10.416 --> 25:12.333
Didn't you say
cats are afraid of witchers?

25:14.708 --> 25:16.375
How about a show?

25:16.500 --> 25:19.208
How about we scout the property?
Make sure
it's secure for the night.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.125
-Ugh!
-[Ciri] Go on, Geralt.

25:22.291 --> 25:23.291
We'll be all right.

25:29.583 --> 25:31.500
[wind gusting]

25:32.666 --> 25:33.833
[door opens]

25:37.041 --> 25:38.375
What a welcome sight.

25:39.041 --> 25:40.208
[spits]

25:44.500 --> 25:47.000
Are you my inquisitor
or executioner?

25:49.583 --> 25:51.125
See where the night takes us.

25:52.041 --> 25:52.958
[scoffs]

25:59.583 --> 26:00.833
Do what you will.

26:03.916 --> 26:05.125
Make no difference in the end.

26:08.291 --> 26:10.166
The White Flame
will cleanse us all.

26:11.750 --> 26:13.541
-[screeching sound]
-[screams]

26:17.458 --> 26:19.375
[moaning]

26:20.875 --> 26:21.875
[coughing]

26:22.875 --> 26:25.083
I need to know
what Nilfgaard wants.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.375
[grunts and coughs]

26:29.916 --> 26:31.541
Resist or submit.

26:32.333 --> 26:33.750
It makes no difference.

26:33.875 --> 26:35.250
[Cahir coughing]

26:36.166 --> 26:37.250
[whimpering]

26:39.000 --> 26:40.625
[Tissaia]
'Tis not in my nature...

26:41.708 --> 26:42.916
to be cruel.

26:44.291 --> 26:47.500
But you have taken
someone from me.

26:48.833 --> 26:50.541
Someone I care about deeply.

26:50.666 --> 26:51.708
[shudders]

26:53.250 --> 26:56.458
So now I will take
your knowledge...

26:56.583 --> 26:58.375
-[gasps]
-...your memories,

26:59.583 --> 27:00.875
your very being,

27:02.250 --> 27:04.250
and leave you cold and helpless,

27:04.375 --> 27:07.375
trapped in the eternal darkness
of your own mind.

27:10.916 --> 27:11.750
I know.

27:13.250 --> 27:14.875
I know you want to scream.

27:16.333 --> 27:18.458
-[whispers] But it's too soon.
-[shivering]

27:18.583 --> 27:21.541
It's too soon, because
I haven't even started yet.

27:21.666 --> 27:23.458
-[crunching and shrieking]
-[gasps]

27:23.583 --> 27:27.375
If evolution has traced
any groove at all in your brain,

27:28.250 --> 27:30.416
-I will plough it
somewhat deeper.
-[crunch]

27:30.541 --> 27:33.291
And then you will know
what a scream can really be!

27:33.416 --> 27:35.208
-[screams]
-[high-pitched ringing]

27:41.541 --> 27:42.750
[bird calls]

27:42.875 --> 27:43.791
[Yennefer groans]

27:47.083 --> 27:48.916
This the best
you can conjure up?

27:51.708 --> 27:53.833
The battle must have
really taken it out of you.

27:55.416 --> 27:58.291
Unlike you, I'm not one to waste
Chaos on frivolous nonsense.

27:58.416 --> 28:01.125
I wouldn't call burning
half your forces frivolous.

28:02.666 --> 28:05.333
Pity you're in dimeritium chains
behind enemy lines, then.

28:06.208 --> 28:08.083
Or else you could
conjure us up a boar to eat.

28:11.083 --> 28:12.375
[man grunting]

28:13.541 --> 28:14.708
[groaning]

28:21.958 --> 28:22.916
You're on the run.

28:24.208 --> 28:27.208
-We won.
-A battle. The war's just begun.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.708
The refrain of the defeated,
how sad.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.250
Sodden was merely a raindrop
before the storm.

28:32.833 --> 28:33.833
Look at you.

28:35.416 --> 28:37.875
-Why are you doing this?
-Because I'm loyal
to my kingdom.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.250
No, your precious leader's
after something.

28:40.916 --> 28:42.458
You're a pawn to get to it.

28:43.541 --> 28:45.583
I can't imagine...
What's his name, Emhyr?

28:46.916 --> 28:50.375
My humble apologies,the mighty White Flame
himself...

28:51.458 --> 28:54.791
Can't imagine he'll be too happy
to see you return,
tail between your legs.

28:57.625 --> 28:58.875
You know I won't turn.

29:00.625 --> 29:03.125
-That the Brotherhood
won't negotiate.
-They won't want you back.

29:03.958 --> 29:06.333
You've broken their sacred law,
tapped into fire magic.

29:06.458 --> 29:07.666
-At Tissaia's behest.
-Oh!

29:07.791 --> 29:08.958
I'll be lauded for saving them.

29:10.583 --> 29:13.416
I'm sure they'll be
most understanding.
All leaders are.

29:16.791 --> 29:18.208
You're offering me up
as a sacrifice.

29:20.083 --> 29:23.208
A bloody mea culpa
for fucking up
Nilfgaard's great push north.

29:29.416 --> 29:32.125
At least conjure me up
some decent food
before we get to Shitgaard.

29:34.583 --> 29:35.708
[whooshing]

29:37.666 --> 29:39.500
This is what you do
to keep yourself entertained?

29:39.625 --> 29:41.666
To keep myself sane, yes.

29:45.375 --> 29:46.708
It's a famous piece

29:47.708 --> 29:51.083
I first saw as a lad
whilst studying at Oxenfurt.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.041
Aah!

29:54.500 --> 29:57.666
It tells the tale
of a doomed young Elven warrior

29:58.583 --> 30:00.458
and a human
she falls in love with.

30:01.708 --> 30:02.708
What's it called?

30:03.375 --> 30:05.333
<i>The Fall of the Elders.</i>

30:08.708 --> 30:11.500
<i>Elven warrior, human mage</i>

30:11.625 --> 30:13.333
<i>Ordained by hate to kill</i>

30:14.208 --> 30:16.708
<i>Instead found love and ran away</i>

30:16.833 --> 30:18.500
<i>Against their people's will</i>

30:21.791 --> 30:22.875
It's beautiful.

30:23.500 --> 30:24.625
[chuckles]

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
<i>Into bliss, the two did wed</i>

30:28.583 --> 30:29.791
<i>A baby on the way</i>

30:31.125 --> 30:33.083
<i>A child born to parents dead</i>

30:34.166 --> 30:36.666
<i>That fateful winter's day</i>

30:36.791 --> 30:38.666
[faint screeching]

30:40.041 --> 30:42.833
-[Roach whickers]
-It's as if she's determined

30:42.958 --> 30:45.333
to do the opposite of the thing
that'll keep her safe.

30:47.583 --> 30:50.208
Verbose when I need her
to be quiet. [sighs]

30:50.333 --> 30:52.708
Stubborn and sullen
when I need her to talk.

30:55.625 --> 30:57.250
Looks like
you're in good company.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.625
You remind me of an old friend.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.083
Mousesack.

31:08.458 --> 31:10.166
Sometimes it doesn't seem real.

31:12.458 --> 31:13.416
That he's gone.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.583
And I just--

31:17.583 --> 31:19.625
I wish I could
go back in time and save him.

31:20.416 --> 31:21.333
Save everyone.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.416
Can I come with you?

31:24.625 --> 31:27.416
I have a few things
I should like
to change myself. [chuckles]

31:30.500 --> 31:31.375
What's it like?

31:34.083 --> 31:36.041
Being alone
because of what you are?

31:38.791 --> 31:40.458
It's what eats you alive.

31:41.750 --> 31:42.791
Loneliness.

31:43.916 --> 31:45.125
[Nivellen sighs]

31:51.541 --> 31:53.625
Have... have you ever tried
to cure yourself?

31:54.500 --> 31:57.458
Oh, I've plied many a lass
with treasure to kiss me,

31:57.583 --> 32:00.708
hoping there was a grain
of truth to those fairy tales.

32:00.833 --> 32:03.041
Maybe you just haven't
found the right one yet.

32:04.125 --> 32:07.000
Mousesack told me
of a hedgehog man
who was cured by true love.

32:07.875 --> 32:08.708
Lucky chap.

32:09.958 --> 32:11.208
He was probably worthy.

32:14.458 --> 32:15.958
You saw my statue garden.

32:17.708 --> 32:19.666
All my servants
are buried there.

32:21.166 --> 32:23.125
I killed them the day I turned,

32:23.958 --> 32:25.708
not knowing what I was,

32:25.833 --> 32:27.541
not knowing my own strength.

32:28.750 --> 32:31.166
I deserve my destiny.

32:36.541 --> 32:37.333
Come.

32:38.375 --> 32:39.541
I'm being a bore.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.500
And you must be tired.

32:42.500 --> 32:43.625
[chuckles]

32:53.625 --> 32:54.750
[Nivellen] Here we are.

32:59.250 --> 33:00.291
It's been a treat.

33:05.416 --> 33:06.708
Those people you killed...

33:09.583 --> 33:10.625
you didn't mean to.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.250
[chuckles]

33:18.416 --> 33:19.333
Sometimes...

33:20.208 --> 33:21.791
I think I'm still a man.

33:23.041 --> 33:23.958
But mostly...

33:25.125 --> 33:26.666
I know what I really am.

33:32.375 --> 33:34.625
I watched my entire home

33:36.125 --> 33:38.375
burn to the ground
at the hands of another.

33:40.916 --> 33:42.583
My family trapped inside.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.708
You don't seem
like a monster to me.

33:49.916 --> 33:52.041
I appreciate that, my dear.

33:53.333 --> 33:55.666
Monsters are more

33:55.791 --> 33:58.375
than just horrid looks
and claws and teeth.

33:59.625 --> 34:02.000
Monsters are born of deeds done.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.500
Unforgivable ones.

34:10.500 --> 34:11.333
Good night.

34:14.416 --> 34:15.541
Good night, Nivellen.

34:34.375 --> 34:35.916
-[Roach whickers]
-[sighs]

34:39.583 --> 34:41.458
[snorting]

34:50.375 --> 34:52.166
-[wind whistling]
-[horse neighing]

34:57.833 --> 34:59.250
[clicking]

35:03.750 --> 35:05.583
[Roach neighs]

35:38.125 --> 35:41.375
Finest mead from the rarest
Korathian desert honey.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.916
-Aah.
-Let's play a drinking game.

35:51.041 --> 35:53.041
Oh, now we're talking!

35:53.916 --> 35:54.833
What sort?

35:56.833 --> 35:58.083
We throw daggers.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.291
Whoever misses
your dear father's head

36:01.958 --> 36:02.750
drinks...

36:03.708 --> 36:04.958
and tells a truth.

36:05.083 --> 36:06.125
Prepare to lose.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.083
-You first. [chuckles]
-Hmm.

36:19.625 --> 36:20.375
[Nivellen laughs]

36:21.166 --> 36:23.041
Let's start with the obvious.

36:23.791 --> 36:26.041
How in the name
of all that's sacred...

36:27.291 --> 36:30.333
how did you find yourself
looking after a young girl?

36:30.458 --> 36:32.500
I promised her grandmother
before she died.

36:40.708 --> 36:41.500
[Nivellen chuckles]

36:42.208 --> 36:43.166
What's your plan?

36:43.833 --> 36:44.916
Keep her alive.

36:46.416 --> 36:47.708
That's it?

36:47.833 --> 36:49.833
I can protect her
from any mark of man or monster.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.875
And you said so yourself.
The world is changing.

36:55.166 --> 36:57.458
Perhaps that's why
the Law of Surprise
brought us together.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.791
Oh, that devious old chestnut.

36:59.916 --> 37:02.208
-Hmm.
-The plot thickens, huh?

37:04.166 --> 37:06.750
-Your turn.
-[chuckles] Oh-ho-ho-ho.

37:10.666 --> 37:11.458
Bull's-eye.

37:11.583 --> 37:12.833
[laughs]

37:21.875 --> 37:23.208
[Nivellen laughs]

37:24.125 --> 37:25.958
You've become a lightweight,
old friend.

37:26.833 --> 37:27.958
So it seems.

37:28.083 --> 37:30.208
You spend a lifetime alone,

37:31.416 --> 37:34.291
then you claim a child
of an ancient promise
of destiny.

37:35.916 --> 37:37.125
What changed you?

37:39.125 --> 37:39.875
Who.

37:42.708 --> 37:44.083
Yennefer of Vengerberg.

37:45.375 --> 37:47.583
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

37:47.708 --> 37:50.958
And where is this rarest
and fairest of all maidens?

37:51.083 --> 37:53.916
The one who could crack
an icy witcher's heart?

37:54.041 --> 37:55.125
She's dead.

38:02.833 --> 38:03.958
I'm sorry, my boy.

38:05.750 --> 38:06.541
How long ago?

38:08.750 --> 38:09.791
A few days.

38:14.833 --> 38:16.541
How are you not heartbroken?

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Who says I'm not?

38:26.083 --> 38:28.041
[horse snorting]

38:29.333 --> 38:30.833
-Your horse, it's lame.
-[Fringilla] I know.

38:31.666 --> 38:33.250
If I dismount,
my men will eat it.

38:34.458 --> 38:37.541
Horses, whores, and mages.
All useful till we're not.

38:40.333 --> 38:42.583
Do you really think
offering me as a sacrifice

38:42.708 --> 38:44.375
-will be enough
to spare your failure?
-[sighs]

38:45.458 --> 38:47.041
You'll watch my head roll
right before your own.

38:49.333 --> 38:52.666
-Look. The North has won.
-Hmm.

38:52.791 --> 38:56.000
Join us. I'll tell them
you saved me.
You can redeem yourself.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.750
Redeem myself
from what, exactly?

38:58.833 --> 39:02.416
You think that we ventured north
to conquer? We came to liberate.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.750
You were weak at Aretuza,
but you had your own mind.

39:04.875 --> 39:06.750
That implies choice.

39:06.875 --> 39:10.541
I was placed in a kingdom
at the whim of the Brotherhood's
wants. We all were.

39:10.666 --> 39:13.208
Just gilded pawns to control
kingdoms, nothing more.

39:13.333 --> 39:15.166
We weren't forced
to do anything.

39:15.291 --> 39:17.500
Should I have left
my post as you did?

39:17.625 --> 39:19.916
Shirked my duties,
wasted my talents?

39:21.000 --> 39:23.875
-If I'd had Tissaia
to shield me--
-If you'd thought for yourself

39:24.000 --> 39:25.250
instead of licking
others' boots.

39:26.666 --> 39:28.791
Eager to please. Easy to wound.

39:28.916 --> 39:30.083
You're blind, Yennefer.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.666
-[snorts]
-[Geralt] Anything else?

39:38.791 --> 39:40.541
-[chuckling]
-I have nothing to hide.

39:40.666 --> 39:41.875
From me, maybe.

39:43.041 --> 39:44.666
But have you told the girl
the truth?

39:47.000 --> 39:50.791
That witchers obtain children
so they can feed them
with magic herbs.

39:51.708 --> 39:54.750
The few who survive
become witchers themselves.

39:54.875 --> 39:58.125
All human feelings and reactions
are trained out of them.

39:59.083 --> 40:01.000
They are turned into monsters

40:01.125 --> 40:02.791
to kill other monsters.

40:02.916 --> 40:04.666
That's not going
to happen to her.

40:04.791 --> 40:06.166
But it happened to you.

40:11.916 --> 40:13.125
For better or worse,

40:14.041 --> 40:15.083
she's with you now.

40:16.416 --> 40:17.875
How does she feel about it?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.750
Ohh!

40:21.875 --> 40:25.250
The look of a man who's worried
he's lost his touch.

40:25.375 --> 40:26.625
-[laughs]
-Hmm.

40:31.333 --> 40:34.500
The look of a man
who's wondering why
his old friend is cheating.

40:34.625 --> 40:35.583
[gulps]

40:36.708 --> 40:38.041
You've got me there!

40:38.166 --> 40:40.000
[laughs]

40:40.750 --> 40:42.166
Magic knives.

40:42.291 --> 40:44.041
[laughs]

40:44.166 --> 40:45.166
But why?

40:46.958 --> 40:49.333
I've seen you piss yourself
in a wyvern den.

40:51.166 --> 40:53.833
I know who you truly are.
What are you hiding now?

40:54.458 --> 40:56.375
[scoffs]

40:59.375 --> 41:01.833
I need to drain the snake
and hit the silk.

41:05.208 --> 41:07.416
Go to sleep,
you sullen old codger.

41:08.916 --> 41:10.166
See you in the morning.

41:11.333 --> 41:12.333
[door closes]

41:17.583 --> 41:19.000
It's all right, Vereena.

41:19.791 --> 41:21.875
-[scratching]
-We won't hurt you.

41:24.291 --> 41:25.666
We're just here for the night.

41:27.333 --> 41:28.833
Then you can have
your house back.

41:33.333 --> 41:34.583

42:40.833 --> 42:41.625
Who are you?

42:43.666 --> 42:45.250
I'm Vereena.
A friend of Nivellen.

42:49.291 --> 42:51.666
You were having a nightmare.
I came to check on you.

42:55.375 --> 42:57.125
Did you like
the dress I left for you?

42:59.416 --> 43:00.375
That was you?

43:02.333 --> 43:03.083
Yes.

43:04.916 --> 43:05.750
Thank you.

43:08.791 --> 43:10.291
-Nivellen said you were a cat.
-Mmm.

43:12.208 --> 43:13.125
What are you?

<i>-But I am like you.</i>
-[whine fades]

43:22.416 --> 43:23.375
How did you do that?

43:24.750 --> 43:25.875
I've never met anyone...

43:26.583 --> 43:28.208
alone in the heart, like you.

43:29.250 --> 43:30.000
Different.

43:32.000 --> 43:32.875
Not one of many.

43:35.750 --> 43:36.791
-Oh...
-[fluttering]

43:36.916 --> 43:38.458
Why do you travel with that man?

43:39.375 --> 43:40.500
I know what he is.

43:41.208 --> 43:42.625
He kills things.

43:43.916 --> 43:45.500
Monsters, yes.

43:46.750 --> 43:47.500
Kills them.

43:48.625 --> 43:49.583
Hmm.

43:51.291 --> 43:52.125
Are you a monster?

43:54.833 --> 43:56.791
Are you a monster
because you are different?

43:58.166 --> 44:00.083
Monsters do bad things
to people.

44:00.208 --> 44:02.291
Humans do bad things
to everybody.

44:02.416 --> 44:03.166
-Mmm.
-[soft growl]

44:05.208 --> 44:05.958
Nivellen...

44:08.125 --> 44:09.500
He hid you from the witcher.

44:14.750 --> 44:15.583
He loves you.

44:17.041 --> 44:18.166
-[soft growl]
-Mmm.

If anyone other than me
leaves this place,
ride for your life.

46:08.041 --> 46:10.375
-What's happening?
-There's a bruxa in the house.

46:11.250 --> 46:13.000
A what? What are you doing?

46:14.583 --> 46:15.750
What's going on, Geralt?

46:15.875 --> 46:16.750

49:33.791 --> 49:35.791
[sound of screeching traveling]

49:36.541 --> 49:37.791
[gasps]

49:38.916 --> 49:40.791
[wind gusting]

49:44.708 --> 49:46.333
[distant roaring]

49:48.083 --> 49:49.666
[gasping]

49:58.083 --> 49:59.875
[sound of clicking approaching]

50:00.583 --> 50:02.416
[screeching]

50:15.375 --> 50:16.666
[chittering]

50:16.791 --> 50:18.625
[clicking and screeching]

50:22.958 --> 50:23.958
Geralt!

50:24.083 --> 50:25.916
-[sighs]
-[slow clicking]

50:30.583 --> 50:31.625
Geralt!

50:31.750 --> 50:32.875
[clicking speeding up]

50:36.458 --> 50:38.000
-[screeching]
-[grunts]

50:49.541 --> 50:50.833
Cirilla.

50:51.916 --> 50:53.666
-Geralt, wait. Please.
-Get away from it.

50:59.708 --> 51:01.291
I'll rip her throat out

51:01.958 --> 51:03.958
unless you leave us alone!

51:05.750 --> 51:06.708
[screeches]

51:08.916 --> 51:10.416
[Vereena wails]

51:13.166 --> 51:14.208
I'm sorry.

51:15.875 --> 51:18.125
I'm so sorry.

51:18.750 --> 51:20.250
[wheezing]

51:20.916 --> 51:22.916
[crunching]

51:30.458 --> 51:31.583
[gasps]

51:33.208 --> 51:34.125
Mine...

51:37.333 --> 51:38.708
[gasping]

51:38.833 --> 51:40.750
...or nobody's.

51:44.916 --> 51:46.291
[whimpers]

51:46.416 --> 51:47.458
I love you.

51:53.125 --> 51:53.875
Love you.

51:54.541 --> 51:55.291
Huh?

51:56.000 --> 51:57.458
[screeches]

51:58.041 --> 51:58.833
No!

52:01.166 --> 52:02.416
No!

52:03.375 --> 52:05.250
[yells] No!

52:06.250 --> 52:07.208
-[sobbing]
-[gasps]

52:10.291 --> 52:12.041
<i>He'll come for you too.</i>

52:15.583 --> 52:16.916
[roaring sounds]

52:17.041 --> 52:18.208
[groaning]

52:18.875 --> 52:20.291
[screaming]

52:25.291 --> 52:26.125
[groans]

52:36.416 --> 52:38.041
[gasping]

52:40.208 --> 52:41.125
Why, Geralt?

52:45.250 --> 52:46.125
It's wrong.

52:47.208 --> 52:48.166
It's wrong. [groans]

52:49.041 --> 52:51.000
[yells] It's all wrong!

52:51.958 --> 52:53.333
The curse has lifted.

52:55.833 --> 52:57.166
You are free now.

52:58.750 --> 52:59.541
Free?

53:02.375 --> 53:03.958
This is what you call...

53:05.208 --> 53:06.291
free?

53:06.416 --> 53:07.625
[sighs]

53:12.458 --> 53:13.916
I found her in the woods.

53:15.458 --> 53:16.208
Injured.

53:17.083 --> 53:17.875
Starving.

53:20.583 --> 53:21.916
She wasn't scared of me.

53:24.083 --> 53:25.166
And when she healed...

53:27.583 --> 53:29.083
she chose to stay.

53:30.416 --> 53:31.500
She didn't care...

53:33.291 --> 53:34.375
what I looked like.

53:35.750 --> 53:37.291
And to ease her cravings,

53:38.583 --> 53:40.166
I let her feed on me.

53:41.500 --> 53:43.416
-But--
-[Geralt] She couldn't
control herself?

53:46.958 --> 53:47.916
She was a monster.

53:51.125 --> 53:51.875
No.

53:55.000 --> 53:55.833
That's not true.

53:58.625 --> 54:00.291
[Ciri] It doesn't matter
if she was or wasn't.

54:02.750 --> 54:03.458
She loved you.

54:07.041 --> 54:08.083
Love and blood.

54:10.250 --> 54:12.000
They both possess
a mighty power.

54:14.916 --> 54:18.208
Learned men and mages
have wracked
their brains over it for years.

54:21.208 --> 54:23.958
-And they've arrived
at nothing except...
-...true love.

54:26.833 --> 54:27.750
To lose...

54:29.916 --> 54:30.833
true love.

54:33.541 --> 54:34.541
That's what it is.

54:45.833 --> 54:46.750
I knowingly...

54:48.250 --> 54:51.250
turned my eyes away from
what she did to the villagers,

54:52.791 --> 54:54.250
because she didn't care

54:54.958 --> 54:57.000
that I was cursed
all those years ago.

54:58.416 --> 55:00.083
Not for destroying the temple.

55:03.791 --> 55:05.166
For raping the priestess.

55:11.291 --> 55:12.333
Ciri...

55:22.791 --> 55:24.000
[grunts]

55:29.291 --> 55:31.458
Please stay. Don't go.

55:33.416 --> 55:34.333
I beg you.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.041
Use your sword.

55:38.458 --> 55:39.250
End this.

55:40.583 --> 55:41.375
For me.

55:43.750 --> 55:44.875
You're mortal now.

55:46.791 --> 55:48.000
Do it yourself.

55:48.125 --> 55:48.875
[sobs]

55:55.875 --> 55:57.541
[whooshing]

56:22.666 --> 56:23.750
[sighs]

56:27.958 --> 56:30.166
When I say run,

56:31.916 --> 56:32.750
you run.

56:34.666 --> 56:35.750
When I say hide,

56:37.208 --> 56:37.958
you hide.

56:40.208 --> 56:41.916
-And when I say get to Roach--
-I know.

56:44.500 --> 56:45.458
[sighs]

56:53.333 --> 56:54.958
I think there's something
wrong with me.

56:59.166 --> 57:01.166
Everywhere I go, people die.

57:06.333 --> 57:07.166
Sometimes, I...

57:11.250 --> 57:12.333
I feel like I could...

57:14.375 --> 57:15.541
burn the whole world.

57:18.208 --> 57:19.500
I wouldn't mean to.

57:20.875 --> 57:21.625
Just...

57:23.125 --> 57:24.708
It just makes me feel so afraid.

57:26.583 --> 57:27.500
All the time.

57:30.541 --> 57:31.500
Fear is an illness.

57:33.958 --> 57:35.875
If you catch it
and you leave it untreated,

57:37.041 --> 57:38.208
it can consume you.

57:40.750 --> 57:41.916
How do you treat it?

57:42.541 --> 57:43.458
You face it.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.708
Facing your fear is not easy.

57:48.250 --> 57:49.625
But I am here for you.

57:52.375 --> 57:53.958
I won't let anything
happen to you.

57:59.500 --> 58:00.416
All right.

58:13.875 --> 58:14.791
[Geralt sighs]

58:16.250 --> 58:18.291
[Fringilla] Enough!
To your feet!

58:19.666 --> 58:22.416
Cut what you need,
and get moving.
We need to reach Cintra by dawn.

58:23.250 --> 58:24.250
Look at them.

58:25.208 --> 58:27.458
You're leading them
to a salvation
that doesn't exist.

58:28.625 --> 58:29.958
How long
before they turn on you?

58:31.208 --> 58:32.500
-[thumping]
-[screaming]

58:32.625 --> 58:34.166
-[groaning]
-Archers!

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Release me. You know
I'm more powerful.

58:38.833 --> 58:40.250
-I can save us.
-I've got nothing!

58:40.375 --> 58:41.791
[branches cracking]

58:43.458 --> 58:44.750
-Where are they?
-I can't see 'em.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.625
[creaking]

58:55.541 --> 58:56.833
[screaming]
