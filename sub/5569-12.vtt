♪ ♪

00:06.007 --> 00:07.473
(glasses clink)

00:07.475 --> 00:08.974
(two claps)

00:08.976 --> 00:11.777
Welcome to this
very special rush evening

00:11.779 --> 00:14.346
Of the new and improved
kappa kappa tau.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.881
I'm zayday williams, president,

00:15.883 --> 00:18.984
And this is my vice president,
grace gardner.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.686
We would also like
to thank dean munsch

00:20.688 --> 00:22.888
For allowing us to have a winter
semester rush this year.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.724
Well, now that
the unfortunate events

00:25.726 --> 00:27.893
Of the fall semester
are behind us

00:27.895 --> 00:31.063
And the school is back open
and extremely safe,

00:31.065 --> 00:32.865
I thought, why not?

00:32.867 --> 00:36.535
Especially since the new kappa
seems to be aligned so clearly

00:36.537 --> 00:38.737
With mine and the rest
of the student body's

00:38.739 --> 00:42.141
Almost militant commitment
to political correctness

00:42.143 --> 00:45.077
And acceptance of different
and unusual points of view.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.379
As long as they're
always left-leaning.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.181
Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:49.183 --> 00:51.850
I'm gonna go
disinvite jerry seinfeld

00:51.852 --> 00:53.919
From speaking at commencement.

00:53.921 --> 00:55.988
He told a joke
about a woman once.

00:55.990 --> 00:56.989
Allegedly.

00:56.991 --> 00:58.057
(women murmur)

00:59.160 --> 01:01.894
We would also like to
introduce you to our treasurer,

01:01.896 --> 01:03.429
Hester ulrich.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.266
Excuse me. Is it still true
that you guys take

01:07.268 --> 01:08.534
Anyone who wants to pledge?

01:08.536 --> 01:10.269
It's actually now written
in the kappa bylaws.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.405
So today is going to be
filled with us...

01:13.407 --> 01:15.407
Hester:
<i>Hi. It's me, hester.</i>

01:15.409 --> 01:17.843
<i>You may have noticed</i>
<i>my eye patch. It's temporary.</i>

01:17.845 --> 01:19.511
<i>The advantage of</i>
<i>stabbing yourself in the eye</i>

01:19.513 --> 01:21.213
<i>With a stiletto heel</i>
<i>is that you know</i>

01:21.215 --> 01:24.049
<i>Just where to jab it in order</i>
<i>to miss the important organs,</i>

01:24.051 --> 01:25.951
<i>Like your optic nerve</i>
<i>or your brain.</i>

01:25.953 --> 01:28.253
<i>You might have noticed</i>
<i>that I'm the only chanel left.</i>

01:28.255 --> 01:30.422
<i>That's because</i>
<i>I got away with it.</i>

01:30.424 --> 01:32.257
<i>It was a plan</i>
<i>20 years in the making,</i>

01:32.259 --> 01:34.026
<i>And it worked.</i>

01:37.031 --> 01:39.031
<i>You probably think</i>
<i>that growing up</i>

01:39.033 --> 01:40.632
<i>In a mental institution</i>
<i>would be fun.</i>

01:40.634 --> 01:43.135
<i>Plenty of cigarettes</i>
<i>and monopoly.</i>

01:43.137 --> 01:46.605
(both shrieking)

01:46.607 --> 01:48.273
<i>But it was hard at first.</i>

01:48.275 --> 01:49.408
(gigi sobbing)

01:49.410 --> 01:50.976
<i>Gigi was pretty bummed out</i>

01:50.978 --> 01:52.945
<i>About her sister killing</i>
<i>herself with laxatives,</i>

01:52.947 --> 01:54.947
<i>And she cried a lot.</i>

01:54.949 --> 01:57.049
(sobbing loudly)

01:57.051 --> 01:59.051
<i>For three years.</i>

01:59.053 --> 02:00.486
(sobbing continues)

02:00.488 --> 02:02.221
<i>But with the help</i>
<i>of good doctors</i>

02:02.223 --> 02:03.622
<i>And nurses at the asylum,</i>

02:03.624 --> 02:05.791
<i>Gigi was able to turn</i>
<i>her sadness into anger,</i>

02:05.793 --> 02:08.127
<i>And we started planning</i>
<i>our revenge.</i>

02:08.129 --> 02:10.929
(sobbing continues)

02:10.931 --> 02:13.599
Now, this is a hammer.

02:13.601 --> 02:17.102
Hammers are good
for bashing people in the skull

02:17.104 --> 02:19.304
And watching them
bleed to death, okay?

02:19.306 --> 02:21.306
Now, how about this?

02:21.308 --> 02:23.509
Knife!
Okay.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.144
How about this one?

02:25.146 --> 02:26.645
Chain saw.
Great!

02:26.647 --> 02:28.614
Now, what are the advantages
of using this?

02:28.616 --> 02:30.916
Easily cuts through
muscle and bone,

02:30.918 --> 02:32.484
And has the added
advantage of making sure

02:32.486 --> 02:34.486
Your victim's final
emotion is terror.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.521
Suck ass!

02:35.523 --> 02:37.523
That's great, hester.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.024
Now, let's maybe let boone
answer the next one.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.993
But he's a moron.
I know.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.928
I know.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.429
Ow!

02:46.100 --> 02:48.100
(children grunting)

02:48.102 --> 02:50.102
Hester:
<i>We grew. Time passed.</i>

02:50.104 --> 02:51.503
<i>It did get</i>
<i>a little lonely there.</i>

02:51.505 --> 02:53.639
<i>Sometimes I made friends,</i>

02:53.641 --> 02:55.140
<i>But then</i>
<i>the next thing you know,</i>

02:55.142 --> 02:57.042
<i>They're getting</i>
<i>a full frontal lobotomy.</i>

03:03.050 --> 03:05.050
<i>Gigi said that we would be</i>
<i>headed to wallace</i>

03:05.052 --> 03:06.852
<i>To finally put</i>
<i>our plan into action,</i>

03:06.854 --> 03:09.388
<i>So I needed a persona</i>
<i>to hide behind</i>

03:09.390 --> 03:11.623
<i>While we murdered people</i>
<i>and stuff.</i>

03:11.625 --> 03:13.825
<i>Boone decided that his would be</i>
<i>to pretend to be gay,</i>

03:13.827 --> 03:15.961
<i>Which made, like, no sense,</i>
<i>since all that would do is</i>

03:15.963 --> 03:17.396
<i>Make him stand out</i>
<i>amongst those frat dudes.</i>

03:17.398 --> 03:19.398
<i>But boone was never one</i>
<i>for really being smart.</i>

03:19.400 --> 03:20.966
<i>As for me,</i>
<i>what I've noticed is that</i>

03:20.968 --> 03:22.701
<i>The more weird</i>
<i>and gross you are,</i>

03:22.703 --> 03:25.003
<i>The less people want</i>
<i>to know about you.</i>

03:25.005 --> 03:26.572
<i>No one asks the kid</i>
<i>with terrible acne</i>

03:26.574 --> 03:29.374
<i>What their favorite movie is</i>
<i>or where they were born.</i>

03:29.376 --> 03:30.709
<i>Even though</i>
<i>I only ate asylum food</i>

03:30.711 --> 03:32.578
<i>And never really exercised,</i>
<i>I was blessed</i>

03:32.580 --> 03:34.179
<i>With a super tight bod.</i>

03:34.181 --> 03:36.081
<i>My butt could launch</i>
<i>a thousand ships,</i>

03:36.083 --> 03:38.083
<i>And my boobs were remarkably</i>
<i>perky and even.</i>

03:38.085 --> 03:39.985
<i>Couple that with my bj lips,</i>

03:39.987 --> 03:42.087
<i>And I was gonna need</i>
<i>something pretty spectacular</i>

03:42.089 --> 03:44.656
<i>To keep everyone from wanting</i>
<i>to get all up in this.</i>

03:44.658 --> 03:47.426
<i>Once I saw her, I knew I found</i>

03:47.428 --> 03:49.595
<i>My cloak</i>
<i>of social invisibility.</i>

03:54.001 --> 03:55.634
(thunder rumbling)

04:03.944 --> 04:05.744
<i>We needed a cool costume.</i>

04:05.746 --> 04:07.079
<i>All killers</i>
<i>have a cool costume:</i>

04:07.081 --> 04:08.880
<i>Jason with his hockey mask,</i>

04:08.882 --> 04:10.682
<i>Freddy krueger's</i>
<i>sweater and hat,</i>

04:10.684 --> 04:13.986
<i>Cujo's totally realistic</i>
<i>dog costume.</i>

04:17.191 --> 04:18.390
Hey, everyone!

04:18.392 --> 04:20.726
Come down to
jesse helms stadium tonight

04:20.728 --> 04:24.029
To cheer on our very own
wallace university

04:24.031 --> 04:26.465
Red devils!

04:26.467 --> 04:29.434
Kickoff at 7:00 p.M.!
(whoops)

04:37.978 --> 04:39.144
<i>(knife stabbing, man gasping)</i>

04:39.146 --> 04:41.113
Hester:<i> Kind of ironic</i>
<i>that our first victim</i>

04:41.115 --> 04:42.314
<i>Was actually the red devil,</i>

04:42.316 --> 04:43.982
<i>But when you want</i>
<i>to make an omelet, right?</i>

04:43.984 --> 04:46.051
(knife stabbing, man gasping)

04:48.756 --> 04:50.589
<i>But the devil outfit</i>
<i>was perfect.</i>

04:50.591 --> 04:52.457
<i>Unisex, kind of satanic</i>

04:52.459 --> 04:54.059
<i>But not, like,</i>
<i>a giant goat head satanic.</i>

04:54.061 --> 04:56.295
<i>Red and black</i>
<i>so it wouldn't stain</i>

04:56.297 --> 04:57.729
<i>When it was covered in blood.</i>

04:57.731 --> 04:59.564
<i>And since it was</i>
<i>the school mascot,</i>

04:59.566 --> 05:01.933
<i>We could walk around campus</i>
<i>in it without being noticed.</i>

05:01.935 --> 05:03.635
Gigi:
I think he's dead.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.936
Hester:
<i>It was time to begin.</i>

05:04.938 --> 05:07.639
<i>We broke into kappa</i>
<i>and we got busy.</i>

05:10.010 --> 05:11.643
Boone:
I don't understand why

05:11.645 --> 05:13.278
We don't just stab
this dorkus girl.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.980
Because this is
more dramatic.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.081
I don't know.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.182
Stabbing can be
pretty dramatic.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.351
No, this is
more poetic.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.320
It hits these girls
right in their vanity.

05:21.322 --> 05:22.988
Wait, we're spraying
acid on the furniture?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.356
How's that gonna
hurt them?

05:24.358 --> 05:27.025
Just pour the acid in!

05:27.027 --> 05:29.027
Hester:<i> Obvi, I was the brains</i>
<i>of the operation.</i>

05:29.029 --> 05:30.662
<i>Boone was the muscle,</i>

05:30.664 --> 05:34.099
<i>And gigi was the weird</i>
<i>and psycho beating black heart.</i>

05:34.101 --> 05:35.367
<i>We did have to get into college</i>

05:35.369 --> 05:36.668
<i>Before we could</i>
<i>execute our plan.</i>

05:36.670 --> 05:38.103
<i>Hard, since we never</i>
<i>went to high school.</i>

05:38.105 --> 05:40.605
<i>Boone went undercover</i>
<i>a year before I did.</i>

05:40.607 --> 05:42.607
<i>He never actually</i>
<i>enrolled in school.</i>

05:42.609 --> 05:44.609
<i>Since none of those frat guys</i>
<i>ever went to class,</i>

05:44.611 --> 05:46.044
<i>It was easy</i>
<i>to just show up there,</i>

05:46.046 --> 05:48.046
<i>Say he was a student,</i>
<i>and blend right in.</i>

05:48.048 --> 05:49.047
<i>But I wanted to do it right.</i>

05:49.049 --> 05:51.116
Well, hester,

05:51.118 --> 05:53.452
Your high school transcripts
are clearly faked.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.822
And I'm guessing
you made up your sat scores,

05:56.824 --> 05:58.990
'cause it's not possible to get
one million percent on them.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.625
Now, that being said,

06:00.627 --> 06:02.894
We do have a new mandate
here at wallace university

06:02.896 --> 06:04.830
For special needs diversity.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.631
And seeing as
we have no students

06:06.633 --> 06:08.667
With severe
spinal deformities,

06:08.669 --> 06:12.971
I... Am gonna take
a chance on you.

06:13.741 --> 06:14.740
(stamp thuds)

06:16.043 --> 06:17.042
Welcome to wallace.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.043
Thank you, dean.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.244
You won't regret it.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.313
(footsteps echoing)

06:24.151 --> 06:25.050
Hi.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.052
Ooh, cool neck brace.

06:27.054 --> 06:27.919
You ever think about
decorating it?

06:27.921 --> 06:29.087
(gasps)

06:29.089 --> 06:30.355
I've got a bedazzler
back in my room.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.090
What do you say
we spice it up a bit?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.225
Um, no.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.093
But that sounds like
a lot of fun.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.028
I hope you guys aren't
freaked out by my appearance

06:37.030 --> 06:38.530
Or lack of social skills
and money.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.066
Hardly. We're part of a new
wave of kappa kappa tau,

06:41.068 --> 06:43.435
One filled with true sisterhood
and acceptance.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.937
Zayday here is gonna be
president of this place someday.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.506
Come on.
Let's go mingle, babies.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.107
I'll catch up.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.343
By the way,
you guys seem really nice.

06:51.345 --> 06:54.045
I've always said that being nice
is a really good quality.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.914
It could save your life one day.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.215
Hmm.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.683
(chuckles)
great.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.919
Hester:
<i>And so it came to be</i>

07:00.921 --> 07:03.922
<i>That hester ulrich,</i>
<i>daughter of sophia doyle,</i>

07:03.924 --> 07:06.725
<i>Returned to kappa house</i>
<i>to get her revenge.</i>

07:06.727 --> 07:08.727
<i>And that was the night</i>
<i>it all started.</i>

07:08.729 --> 07:10.762
<i>And tonight, it all ends.</i>

07:10.764 --> 07:12.764
<i>Order is restored, as they say.</i>

07:12.766 --> 07:14.566
<i>More than restored-- reborn.</i>

07:14.568 --> 07:17.636
<i>Now I have some true sisters,</i>
<i>some real family.</i>

07:17.638 --> 07:19.971
<i>The only dad I ever had</i>
<i>was the asylum.</i>

07:19.973 --> 07:22.207
<i>My only family were those</i>
<i>nutburgers gigi and boone.</i>

07:22.209 --> 07:24.409
<i>But now I know</i>
<i>who my real dad is</i>

07:24.411 --> 07:26.745
<i>And my real half-sister,</i>
<i>even if they don't.</i>

07:26.747 --> 07:27.946
<i>And the best part is</i>

07:27.948 --> 07:29.114
<i>That that isn't even</i>
<i>the best part.</i>

07:29.116 --> 07:31.583
<i>Well, that isn't</i>
<i>the best part either.</i>

07:31.585 --> 07:34.119
<i>The best part is</i>
<i>who isn't up here with us.</i>

07:34.121 --> 07:36.121
<i>Yep. No chanels.</i>

07:36.123 --> 07:38.423
<i>I mean, someone had to take</i>
<i>all the blame.</i>

07:38.425 --> 07:39.991
<i>Right?</i>

07:46.967 --> 07:48.433
(siren wailing)

07:48.435 --> 07:49.434
Hester:
<i>You're probably thinking,</i>

07:49.436 --> 07:51.002
<i>What kind of person</i>

07:51.004 --> 07:53.138
<i>Could drive a six-inch stiletto</i>
<i>into her own eye socket?</i>

07:53.140 --> 07:54.306
Hester, it's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be okay.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.841
(whispers):
Can we save the shoe?

07:55.843 --> 07:58.176
Hester:<i> A person who did</i>
<i>her homework, that's who!</i>

08:00.113 --> 08:03.415
<i>First, I had to get an x-ray</i>
<i>of my own skull.</i>

08:03.417 --> 08:06.485
<i>Then, I had to calculate</i>
<i>the proper length of the heel,</i>

08:06.487 --> 08:08.019
<i>The angle of the insertion,</i>

08:08.021 --> 08:09.654
<i>With just the right</i>
<i>amount of force</i>

08:09.656 --> 08:12.924
<i>To slip behind the eyeball</i>
<i>without damaging the socket.</i>

08:12.926 --> 08:14.926
<i>Also, it helps to be</i>
<i>completely frickin' insane.</i>

08:14.928 --> 08:16.528
(panting softly)

08:18.465 --> 08:20.198
<i>Because for a plan</i>
<i>like this to work,</i>

08:20.200 --> 08:24.102
<i>You have to be willing</i>
<i>to totally commit.</i>

08:24.104 --> 08:25.637
(screams)

08:25.639 --> 08:27.939
<i>I mean, desperate times</i>
<i>call for desperate measures.</i>

08:27.941 --> 08:29.841
<i>This was the price</i>
<i>I had to pay if I wanted</i>

08:29.843 --> 08:32.677
<i>To get away with murder</i>
<i>and pin it all on someone else.</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:34.112
(whimpers)

08:34.114 --> 08:35.213
(gasps)

08:35.215 --> 08:37.048
(gasping)

08:37.050 --> 08:38.083
The red devil!

08:40.387 --> 08:43.989
<i>Because some people don't</i>
<i>deserve to just get murdered.</i>

08:43.991 --> 08:45.991
<i>They need to be truly punished.</i>

08:45.993 --> 08:47.058
I didn't do it, I swear!

08:47.060 --> 08:49.294
Oh, please, we all know
the guy from nickelback

08:49.296 --> 08:51.463
Did not, in fact,
swipe right on your profile.

08:51.465 --> 08:53.198
Uh, yes, he did, okay?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.066
Nickelback is in town
playing some kid's bat mitzvah.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.168
Please! It was clearly a ruse

08:57.170 --> 09:00.038
So you could sneak back into
the house and kill number six!

09:00.040 --> 09:01.907
I would never, chanel!

09:01.909 --> 09:02.974
I'm one of the good guys!

09:02.976 --> 09:04.376
Look, I-I know,

09:04.378 --> 09:06.177
I know that I can be
socially awkward

09:06.179 --> 09:08.380
And-and a little bit off-putting

09:08.382 --> 09:11.149
And that most people find it
very difficult to be around me,

09:11.151 --> 09:12.484
But you know me, chanel.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.386
I'm not the killer.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.354
Um, excuse me?

09:16.356 --> 09:18.056
I think you're a serial killer

09:18.058 --> 09:19.591
<i>Because</i> I know you,
number five!

09:19.593 --> 09:20.692
You bite your own toenails.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.394
Okay, I am flexible.

09:22.396 --> 09:25.063
Why would I waste my money
buying toenail clippers

09:25.065 --> 09:27.332
When god already blessed me
with toenail clippers

09:27.334 --> 09:29.701
In the form of teeth
in my mouth?!

09:29.703 --> 09:32.070
It's awfully convenient
that you're the one who noticed

09:32.072 --> 09:33.171
Number two's body
went missing.
(gasps)

09:33.173 --> 09:34.739
Maybe you knew
it was gone

09:34.741 --> 09:36.708
'cause you'd already taken it
to the house on shady lane.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.077
Look, we should all just stay up

09:39.079 --> 09:41.546
And wait until number five
gets tired and passes out.

09:41.548 --> 09:42.781
She confesses all
sorts of crazy stuff

09:42.783 --> 09:43.782
In her sleep.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.950
She and I
were roommates

09:44.952 --> 09:46.251
The first year
we lived in the house.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.053
I unlocked the brakes
on grandma's wheelchair

09:48.055 --> 09:49.955
So that she would slide down
the driveway into the traffic.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.189
Shut up!

09:51.191 --> 09:52.958
Go to sleep!

09:52.960 --> 09:55.927
When I fart, I cup it
in my hand and smell it.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.597
Dear god, shut up!

09:58.599 --> 10:01.032
Chanel: Wait a minute.
Everybody, shut up!

10:01.034 --> 10:02.400
I know what happened.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.802
You killed number two

10:03.804 --> 10:05.770
And confessed it in your sleep
to roger and dodger

10:05.772 --> 10:08.573
After a hot night of
letting them eiffel tower you.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.976
And once you knew
that they both knew,

10:10.978 --> 10:12.477
You realized
you'd have to kill them!

10:12.479 --> 10:13.945
Oh.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.114
Oh, I see where this is going.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.983
You're gonna try and pin
all of these murders on me

10:17.985 --> 10:19.551
So I spend the rest
of my life in prison.

10:19.553 --> 10:21.786
Oh, no, my friend.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.389
You... Are going to
the electric chair.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.958
No!

10:26.960 --> 10:29.127
Do they still use those?

10:29.129 --> 10:30.762
Uh-huh.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.796
Okay.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.799
Well, thank you
for letting me know.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.568
Well, well, well.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.336
This just in.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.573
Police chief denise hemphill
just got a call.

10:41.575 --> 10:44.309
A decomposing
male body was found

10:44.311 --> 10:48.079
With rippling abs
and a possible gay face

10:48.081 --> 10:52.951
That appears to be a match
for one boone clemens.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.519
That's right, y'all!

10:54.521 --> 10:56.354
Hot damn, shazam!

10:56.356 --> 10:58.356
Boone is dead.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.992
Excuse me for a second
while I drop the mic.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.427
We already knew
boone was dead.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.362
Pete admitted
to killing him.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.264
Okay, well,
excuse me

11:06.266 --> 11:08.466
For trying
to reiterate the facts

11:08.468 --> 11:10.335
And get us all
on the same page.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.270
I mean, after all,
I am just the chief

11:12.272 --> 11:14.172
Of the whole damn
police department.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.174
Okay, look,
this is all so insane.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.444
Look, we can all freely admit
that number five is fairly odd,

11:19.446 --> 11:20.845
But she is not the killer.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.013
The killer is hester.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.149
Yes, and the proof
is in her files.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.684
(door closes)

11:27.654 --> 11:31.056
The only proof you need
is this hole in my head.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.558
Good news.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.160
Chanel #5 didn't insert
the heel hard enough

11:35.162 --> 11:37.629
To pierce my orbital socket.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.064
The doctors were able
to save my eyeball,

11:39.066 --> 11:41.032
And they said that I'm gonna
make a full recovery.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.033
No, that can't be true.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.234
You're the killer!

11:43.236 --> 11:44.969
Your entire
life story

11:44.971 --> 11:46.137
Is totally fabricated.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.873
Just look at her insane,
obviously made-up,

11:48.875 --> 11:50.075
High school transcript.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.876
I'm very embarrassed
about that.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.879
Yes, it's true, I falsified
my high school transcripts,

11:54.881 --> 11:57.682
But only to cover up the fact
that I was homeschooled.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.050
(gasps)
mm.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.485
I-I was afraid that
if people found out,

12:00.487 --> 12:02.053
They wouldn't ask me
to join a sorority.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.522
Liar! You are the baby
in the bathtub.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.157
You look just
like boone.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.694
And pete told us that your dna
matched boone and my dad.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.596
Are you talking
about the same pete

12:11.598 --> 12:13.098
Who admitted to being
one of the killers?

12:13.100 --> 12:14.599
He's just making
that all up

12:14.601 --> 12:16.534
To cover for his real
partner in crime,

12:16.536 --> 12:17.902
Chanel #5!

12:17.904 --> 12:18.937
No.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.939
Well, then how do you
explain the fact

12:20.941 --> 12:22.540
That there's
absolutely no records

12:22.542 --> 12:24.342
On your parents anywhere?

12:24.344 --> 12:25.543
(doorbell rings)
chanel: Ugh!

12:25.545 --> 12:27.979
I think the answer to that
is at the door.

12:31.752 --> 12:32.751
What?

12:32.753 --> 12:34.352
(dog whimpers)

12:34.354 --> 12:35.120
Sweetheart.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.254
Hester?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.022
Oh, sweetheart, you're okay.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.290
Stepfather.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.759
We came as soon
as we heard.

12:40.761 --> 12:41.760
Hester:
Oh, mother.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.094
Cuddlebear.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.297
Everyone, these are my parents,
clark and delight.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.299
Hester is our
biological daughter.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.401
She definitely
was not adopted.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.303
(chuckles): I have
the stretch marks to prove it.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.739
That's right,
we're prepared to corroborate

12:54.741 --> 12:57.308
Everything my stepdaughter,
hester, has just said.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.910
Do I know you?

12:58.912 --> 13:02.714
Wait, hold on, there's no record
of hester's parents anywhere.

13:02.716 --> 13:04.215
That's because, until recently,

13:04.217 --> 13:06.417
My husband and I
worked for the cia.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.419
Mm-hmm.
We were forced to
remain deep undercover

13:08.421 --> 13:10.421
To protect hester
and cuddlebear

13:10.423 --> 13:12.056
And the people
who love them.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.625
Wait, I do know!
I know where I know you from.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.226
You're from that
prostate commercial.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.162
Can you say that line
I love so much?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.930
Uh...

13:18.932 --> 13:21.432
"thanks, maxflow, my stream's
never been stronger."

13:21.434 --> 13:22.967
"never been stronger," yes!
I love that line!

13:22.969 --> 13:25.970
Well, in order to not blow
their super-secret cia covers,

13:25.972 --> 13:28.406
My parents sometimes work
as actors in commercials.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.507
Oh, yeah, yeah.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.009
Well, I want to
talk to my parents,

13:31.011 --> 13:32.177
So they can explain to you

13:32.179 --> 13:33.611
How I am not a serial killer,

13:33.613 --> 13:35.079
Nor am I the baby
in the bathtub.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.816
Don't worry, I already
called your parents.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.017
(doorbell rings)

13:39.019 --> 13:41.019
Chanel:
Ugh!

13:41.988 --> 13:43.755
Wha...?

13:44.758 --> 13:47.091
Chanel #5:
(gasps) mom and dad!

13:47.093 --> 13:49.594
Hi!

13:49.596 --> 13:53.164
Can you please tell everybody
how I wasn't adopted,

13:53.166 --> 13:55.333
Nor am I a serial killer?

13:55.335 --> 13:58.803
So, we're not
chanel #5's real parents.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.638
A woman named gigi
gave her to us

14:00.640 --> 14:02.874
After a sizable stint
in a mental institution.

14:02.876 --> 14:03.808
What?!

14:03.810 --> 14:05.009
We took her in

14:05.011 --> 14:06.110
Out of the kindness
of our hearts.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.579
And also for
the tax deduction.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.148
That's not true!

14:10.150 --> 14:12.150
All gigi asked was that
when the time came

14:12.152 --> 14:14.452
That we enroll our daughter
at wallace university

14:14.454 --> 14:16.454
And encourage her
to pledge kappa kappa tau.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.456
We tried to love her
like our own,

14:18.458 --> 14:21.559
But, I mean...
She's not great.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.795
And now that the truth is out
that she's probably a murderer,

14:23.797 --> 14:25.363
We don't want to have
anything to do with her.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.965
No!

14:26.967 --> 14:29.200
How could you do this to me?!

14:30.971 --> 14:33.037
I have to be honest,
we've actually discussed doing

14:33.039 --> 14:35.006
Exactly what
you're proposing.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.308
As soon as she learned to
talk, I wanted to disown her.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.979
I mean, maybe she's the killer
on campus, maybe she's not,

14:40.981 --> 14:43.047
But she probably is,
right?
Yeah.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.015
Yeah.
I mean, she just sucks.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.083
Our daughter sucks.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.086
I can't believe
what I'm hearing!

14:48.088 --> 14:49.520
Please tell
them the truth.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.489
It is the truth,
you frumpy monster.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.257
(gasps)

14:52.259 --> 14:53.491
The psychologists said

14:53.493 --> 14:54.692
You probably wouldn't
remember the asylum

14:54.694 --> 14:56.094
On account of it
being so traumatic.

14:56.096 --> 14:59.097
Your mind filled in the gaps
with imagined memories

14:59.099 --> 15:02.066
Of growing up in our house.
But, sweetie, you're toxic,

15:02.068 --> 15:03.935
And you're bumming us out,
so it's time for you to go.
Mm.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.571
Denise: Okay, okay,
I have heard enough.

15:06.573 --> 15:10.375
Now, I still believe that
zayday williams is the killer.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.076
Okay.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.579
But this, this is
real suspicious.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.916
So, chanel #5,

15:17.918 --> 15:20.385
You are under arrest.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.686
What?!

15:21.688 --> 15:23.087
You can't arrest me--
don't you need,

15:23.089 --> 15:24.589
Like, a warrant
or something from a judge?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.024
Denise:
What?!

15:26.026 --> 15:27.692
I'm the chief
of the police department,

15:27.694 --> 15:30.094
And I can arrest whoever I want.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.596
And, little girl, you,

15:31.598 --> 15:34.365
You got the right
to remain silent.
(handcuffs click)

15:34.367 --> 15:37.068
And you got some other
rights that come after that,

15:37.070 --> 15:38.236
And I don't know
what they are,

15:38.238 --> 15:40.571
'cause I don't remember
what I'm supposed to say

15:40.573 --> 15:42.941
After "you got the right
to remain silent," but come on!

15:42.943 --> 15:44.142
Wait, I'm not finished.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.045
She's not the only killer.

15:47.047 --> 15:51.049
You also need to arrest...
Chanel #3!

15:58.725 --> 16:00.091
Wait, you think
I'm the killer?

16:00.093 --> 16:02.827
I know for a fact that
you're working hand-in-hand

16:02.829 --> 16:05.063
With chanel #5 and her evil
killing brother boone,

16:05.065 --> 16:07.131
And that your first victim
was deaf taylor swift.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.100
What? That's impossible.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.269
When the pledges were buried up
to their necks in the backyard,

16:11.271 --> 16:13.905
I was sipping banana daiquiris
at the white stallion.

16:13.907 --> 16:16.074
Well, yeah, you came to
the white stallion with us,

16:16.076 --> 16:17.809
But then you disappeared
as soon as we got there.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.243
Care to elaborate,
number three?

16:19.245 --> 16:20.645
I can explain.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.513
<i>When I got to the bar,</i>

16:22.515 --> 16:23.915
<i>I realized my stomach</i>
<i>was really bothering me.</i>

16:23.917 --> 16:25.750
<i>I thought maybe someone had</i>
<i>put something in my drink</i>

16:25.752 --> 16:27.452
<i>Because I was</i>
<i>getting mad cramps,</i>

16:27.454 --> 16:29.020
<i>And I knew</i>
<i>it was gonna be trouble.</i>

16:29.022 --> 16:31.022
<i>I was past needing</i>
<i>to go number two.</i>

16:31.024 --> 16:32.090
<i>I needed to go</i>

16:32.092 --> 16:33.091
Number three.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.259
(gasping)

16:35.261 --> 16:36.327
<i>But the bathrooms</i>
<i>at the white stallion</i>

16:36.329 --> 16:37.996
<i>Are freakin' disgusting.</i>

16:37.998 --> 16:40.264
<i>There was no way I was gonna</i>
<i>lay down some pipe in there.</i>

16:40.266 --> 16:42.200
<i>So I went back to kappa house</i>

16:42.202 --> 16:43.534
<i>And I destroyed</i>
<i>the bathroom upstairs.</i>

16:43.536 --> 16:44.469
But I didn't kill anyone.

16:44.471 --> 16:45.870
Hmm, so let me
get this straight.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.872
You're accusing someone
here in kappa house

16:47.874 --> 16:50.875
Of putting laxatives
in your cocktail?

16:50.877 --> 16:52.043
Messing with
somebody's regularity?

16:52.045 --> 16:54.212
That's downright criminal.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.214
I just don't understand how
deep the hole's supposed to be.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.648
Whore deep!

16:57.650 --> 16:59.183
What kind of
a question is that?!

16:59.185 --> 17:00.184
(sighs)

17:00.186 --> 17:02.186
Useless.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.688
Hester:
<i>Hmm, but let's say</i>

17:03.690 --> 17:05.323
You aren't lying
and that you didn't

17:05.325 --> 17:07.058
Mow deaf taylor swift's
head off.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.192
I know for a fact

17:08.194 --> 17:10.962
That you killed predatory lez.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.331
No, I didn't.
You know, when you
sent her down there to die

17:13.333 --> 17:16.067
Because you were too ashamed
of your feelings for her,

17:16.069 --> 17:17.735
I went down there
to check on her,

17:17.737 --> 17:20.338
When I caught a glimpse of
someone running up the stairs,

17:20.340 --> 17:22.540
And they were wearing earmuffs!

17:22.542 --> 17:24.409
You're lying!
That's just what I saw.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.310
Well, just saying you saw
something isn't evidence.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.913
No, you right,
it's not evidence.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.515
But it is suspicious.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.916
You know why?

17:31.918 --> 17:33.918
'cause you the only one
in here wearing earmuffs!

17:33.920 --> 17:35.653
Yeah, I know.

17:35.655 --> 17:36.921
Hester:
Let's not forget

17:36.923 --> 17:39.924
The most suspicious fact of all.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.225
You're charles manson's
daughter.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.827
Uh, say what, now?!

17:42.829 --> 17:45.530
And you have a shoebox
full of letters from him

17:45.532 --> 17:48.900
Giving you advice on how
to kill your friends.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.401
Wait, number three,
is that true?

17:50.403 --> 17:51.903
I can explain.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.404
Yes, I've become pen pals

17:53.406 --> 17:55.206
With my biological father,
charles manson.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.108
I wanted my real
dad to help me

17:57.110 --> 17:59.110
With some growing-up stuff,
like how to french-kiss a boy

17:59.112 --> 18:02.113
Or how to know when I've
met mr. Or miss right.

18:02.115 --> 18:04.115
But when he writes back,
his advice is always,

18:04.117 --> 18:05.950
"maybe you should murder some
of your sorority sisters."

18:05.952 --> 18:07.285
Hester: Why don't you
go ahead and read us one?

18:07.287 --> 18:08.619
Mm-hmm.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.021
"precious daughter,

18:10.023 --> 18:12.557
"I'm sorry I don't know anything
about yeast infections,

18:12.559 --> 18:14.058
"but I did see an incredible
story on the news

18:14.060 --> 18:16.194
About, uh, a pizza guy who
had a bomb strapped to him."

18:16.196 --> 18:17.361
What?

18:17.363 --> 18:18.930
"I'm totes sad
that I can't order

18:18.932 --> 18:20.965
"a pizza to the penitentiary and
strap a bomb to the pizza guy,

18:20.967 --> 18:23.301
But that doesn't
mean y-you can't."

18:23.970 --> 18:25.403
Oh, man.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.605
That's real suspicious.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.040
I-I'm telling you, I
didn't kill anybody.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.408
Well, maybe<i> you</i> didn't,

18:30.410 --> 18:31.976
But your split personality did.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.579
I have a signed letter here
from your psychiatrist.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.980
I've never been
to a psychiatrist.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.715
Well, your split
personality has.

18:37.717 --> 18:38.916
It says right here.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.318
"dear hester,

18:40.320 --> 18:44.755
"yes, I treated chanel #3
for split personality disorder

18:44.757 --> 18:46.924
"over the course
of about eight months.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.560
"she showed up at my office
in a leather jacket,

18:49.562 --> 18:52.063
"claiming her name
was dirty helen

18:52.065 --> 18:53.731
"and that she
was the leader

18:53.733 --> 18:56.134
"of a notorious
west coast biker gang.
(gasps)

18:56.136 --> 18:58.302
"dirty helen made threats
against my family,

18:58.304 --> 19:01.172
"and I was forced
to move my practice

19:01.174 --> 19:02.607
"out of the country.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.109
Signed, dr. Adam berkel, md."

19:05.111 --> 19:06.911
Oh, my god, so you're saying

19:06.913 --> 19:09.113
That dirty helen could have
killed sam and deaf taylor swift

19:09.115 --> 19:10.281
And I would have no
memory of killing them

19:10.283 --> 19:11.916
Or receiving treatment?

19:11.918 --> 19:13.484
That's exactly how
a split personality works.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.487
Chanel #5 admitted to you that
she was the baby in the bathtub,

19:16.489 --> 19:18.189
And then she convinced
your split personality

19:18.191 --> 19:20.024
To join her on a killing spree.

19:20.026 --> 19:23.027
So, dirty helen, I'm the other
baby in the bathtub,

19:23.029 --> 19:25.163
And I want you to join
my killing spree.

19:25.165 --> 19:28.032
Okay, cool. But let's
not tell chanel #3.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.000
Chanel #5:
<i>This conversation</i>

19:29.002 --> 19:30.034
Never took place!

19:30.036 --> 19:32.370
Yeah, but if it did,
I wouldn't remember

19:32.372 --> 19:33.971
'cause you were talking to
my evil split personality,

19:33.973 --> 19:35.106
Dirty helen.

19:35.108 --> 19:38.376
Okay, chanel #3,
you are under arrest.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.444
Chanel #3:
Sam, wherever you are,

19:40.446 --> 19:43.314
I'm so sorry my split
personality murdered you!

19:43.316 --> 19:44.649
(handcuffs click)
wait!

19:44.651 --> 19:47.018
There's someone else
you need to arrest, too.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.053
Chanel oberlin!

19:56.563 --> 19:58.029
Wait, what?
Uh, excuse me.

19:58.031 --> 20:01.065
Uh, if you're gonna just
continue to accuse everyone,

20:01.067 --> 20:02.233
Could we at
least sit down?

20:02.235 --> 20:04.502
Liam, we're gonna
lose our reservation.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.504
Uh, it's all really
interesting though.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.506
I have proof that you,
chanel oberlin,

20:08.508 --> 20:10.908
Entered a home improvement
store two months ago

20:10.910 --> 20:12.910
And purchased
the following items:

20:12.912 --> 20:15.313
<i>A garden shear, a riding mower,</i>
<i>three chain saws,</i>

20:15.315 --> 20:17.848
<i>A pneumatic nail gun, two axes,</i>

20:17.850 --> 20:18.883
And a crossbow.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.885
Okay, first of all,

20:20.887 --> 20:22.887
I was the one who was shot
with the crossbow!

20:22.889 --> 20:24.322
And also they don't
sell crossbows

20:24.324 --> 20:25.723
At home improvement centers!

20:25.725 --> 20:29.160
Oh, chanel, the security
footage begs to differ.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
<i>It's also stated right here,</i>

20:36.002 --> 20:39.503
<i>In your diners club</i>
<i>monthly statement.</i>

20:39.505 --> 20:40.871
I'll take that, too.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.206
What?!

20:42.208 --> 20:43.941
I don't have a diners club card!

20:43.943 --> 20:46.244
Is diners club
still even a thing?

20:46.246 --> 20:49.247
I still keep one
in my wallet for backup.
Mm.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.250
I don't know why I'm the one
who always has to bring this up,

20:52.252 --> 20:56.087
But we did all watch chanel
burn ms. Bean's face off.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.258
For the<i> last</i> time,

21:00.260 --> 21:02.460
That was a hell week prank
gone wrong!

21:02.462 --> 21:04.195
I didn't know the
oil was boiling!

21:04.197 --> 21:05.529
Someone turned on
that deep fryer!

21:06.566 --> 21:08.633
(deep fryer whirring)

21:11.738 --> 21:13.104
I don't know.
Chanel #3:
And I did just

21:13.106 --> 21:14.572
Watch you try to
murder melanie dorkus

21:14.574 --> 21:15.940
With a pair of scissors
earlier this afternoon.

21:15.942 --> 21:16.941
I only did that

21:16.943 --> 21:19.910
Because I thought
she was the killer!

21:19.912 --> 21:22.013
I mean, I'm telling you,
I'm not the red devil!

21:24.117 --> 21:25.283
You bitch.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.784
What is your game here?

21:26.786 --> 21:29.086
I mean, I'm all for number
five being the killer.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.921
She's a weird psychopath

21:30.923 --> 21:33.791
Who would look like
boone's homely, bloated sister

21:33.793 --> 21:36.093
If she let her horrible
black roots grow out.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.928
She probably<i> is</i> the
baby in the bathtub.

21:37.930 --> 21:41.999
And I am 100% not surprised
that chanel #3

21:42.001 --> 21:43.467
Is also a psycho
with a split personality,

21:43.469 --> 21:46.737
Who is helping
number five murder everybody!

21:46.739 --> 21:47.972
But why me?!

21:47.974 --> 21:49.840
I mean, I am a pillar
of this community.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.109
I'm also already
hot and rich.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.944
What would I have to gain
by hatching a plan

21:53.946 --> 21:56.080
To knock off a bunch
of nameless dumb whores?

21:56.082 --> 21:58.082
I don't think that you did
hatch the plan, chanel.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.451
But I think that once
the murders started happening,

22:00.453 --> 22:02.920
You saw it as the perfect
opportunity to knock off

22:02.922 --> 22:05.356
The pledges that you thought
would ruin kappa kappa tau.

22:05.358 --> 22:08.459
With each murdered pledge,
this sorority house

22:08.461 --> 22:10.961
Got closer to being
the kappa tau

22:10.963 --> 22:12.763
That you always
intended it to be!

22:12.765 --> 22:13.998
Oh, yeah?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.833
Well, then why didn't I kill

22:15.835 --> 22:17.335
The two pledges
I actually hate--

22:17.337 --> 22:19.136
Dumb-ass grace
and stupid zayday?

22:19.138 --> 22:21.272
Plausible deniability!
You knew by keeping

22:21.274 --> 22:24.008
These two alive that it would
keep everyone off your scent.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.109
No!

22:25.111 --> 22:26.977
Come on, cyclops.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.045
In the sleuthing
business,

22:28.047 --> 22:30.648
That's what we call
ice-cold logic.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.717
It's obvious

22:32.719 --> 22:33.951
When you look
at it, chanel,

22:33.953 --> 22:36.554
That everything that's happened
on this campus so far

22:36.556 --> 22:37.888
Is just the logical next step

22:37.890 --> 22:39.957
For sororities
everywhere.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.459
Because what's
murder if not

22:41.461 --> 22:43.461
The most perfect,
ultimate form of hazing?

22:43.463 --> 22:47.198
What better way for you to knock
off everyone that you hate,

22:47.200 --> 22:49.333
Because they're different
from you or not as popular

22:49.335 --> 22:51.335
Or not as pretty,
than to murder them

22:51.337 --> 22:52.603
One by one?!

22:54.006 --> 22:55.106
(chanels gasping)

22:57.910 --> 22:59.477
Congratulations, chanel.

23:01.314 --> 23:04.014

<i>...Justice had been served.</i>

25:06.105 --> 25:08.305
<i>Chad radwell</i>
<i>and denise hemphill</i>

25:08.307 --> 25:10.608
<i>Continued their torrid</i>
<i>love affair.</i>

25:10.610 --> 25:12.877
<i>It ceased to be</i>
<i>just a booty call.</i>

25:12.879 --> 25:15.846
<i>When they broke up,</i>
<i>he was devastated.</i>

25:15.848 --> 25:16.981
I'm sorry!

25:16.983 --> 25:18.816
I just don't understand
how you just end it.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.118
Because we're
chasing waterfalls!

25:21.120 --> 25:22.653
We got to stick
to the rivers

25:22.655 --> 25:24.555
And the lakes that we used to!

25:24.557 --> 25:27.057
I thought we were
in the marriage zone.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.693
I don't have a choice
is what I'm telling you.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.829
I got to be
in quantico tomorrow.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.697
I know you need me.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.798
You need all of this.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.200
But the fbi needs me more.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.835
The fbi is not gonna have that.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.103
That's mine!

25:39.906 --> 25:41.038
Denise, you hurt me real bad.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.039
Don't do that.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.574
Wait, wait! No, no!

25:43.576 --> 25:45.042
Baby, please!

25:45.044 --> 25:46.577
Don't let it end like this.

25:47.813 --> 25:48.979
Don't do that to us.

25:48.981 --> 25:52.016
Come on.
Come on, baby.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.884

26:02.161 --> 26:04.929
We got too close
to the sun, baby.

26:04.931 --> 26:07.097
We shined too bright.

26:07.099 --> 26:10.034
I promise I will never bang
anyone the way I banged you.

Press outlets of the world,

On behalf of all
the dickie dollar scholars

26:39.632 --> 26:42.099
Who are no longer with us...
(sighs)

26:42.101 --> 26:45.636
I would like to announce
the formation of...

26:45.638 --> 26:47.071
The dickie dollar earl grey

26:47.073 --> 26:49.239
Roger dodger caulfield
charitable foundation,

26:49.241 --> 26:52.943
Or the ddegrdccf.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.879
From henceforth, all proceeds

26:55.881 --> 26:57.481
From every
dollar scholar kegger,

26:57.483 --> 27:00.985
Wet t-shirt contest,
coed mud wrestling tournament

27:00.987 --> 27:02.653
And jell-o shot gavage

27:02.655 --> 27:05.055
Will go-- that's right--

27:05.057 --> 27:06.957
To charity.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.827
What's up?

27:09.829 --> 27:12.997
What charity will the dollar
scholars be pledging to support?

27:12.999 --> 27:14.932
What do you mean,
"what charity"?

27:14.934 --> 27:17.067
Just charity.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.602
All proceeds will go to charity.

27:18.604 --> 27:21.105
Yes, uh, but
which charity?

27:21.107 --> 27:24.908
Uh... I-I don't know.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.111
All of them?
(reporters murmuring)

27:27.113 --> 27:29.346
Okay, you know, I'm not a big
fan of gotcha questions, dude!

27:29.348 --> 27:31.315
My friends are dead!
I have nothing left!

27:31.317 --> 27:33.117
Nothing!

27:33.119 --> 27:34.585
Next question.

27:34.587 --> 27:36.320
Munsch:
<i>As for me,</i>

27:36.322 --> 27:39.623
<i>I wrote up a quick book</i>
<i>and became a media sensation.</i>

27:39.625 --> 27:42.126
<i>I was on the cover of</i>
time, newsweek

27:42.128 --> 27:44.161
<i>And</i> men's health.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.929
<i>Well, I didn't write it.</i>

27:45.931 --> 27:47.598
<i>I had a ghostwriter do it.</i>

27:47.600 --> 27:48.966
Okay, well, there you go.

27:48.968 --> 27:52.770
Dean munsch, your book
is an absolute revelation.

27:52.772 --> 27:53.771
Is there any way

27:53.773 --> 27:55.039
You could sum up your philosophy

27:55.041 --> 27:58.175
On new new feminism
in just a few words?

27:58.177 --> 28:00.144
Um...

28:00.146 --> 28:02.813
If feminism was about demanding

28:02.815 --> 28:04.181
Equal treatment
for women,

28:04.183 --> 28:06.617
And new feminism was saying

28:06.619 --> 28:10.287
That men and women are integral
complements to one another,

28:10.289 --> 28:12.823
Then I guess we could sum up,

28:12.825 --> 28:14.191
Uh, new new feminism

28:14.193 --> 28:17.327
Really in three
simple words:

28:17.329 --> 28:19.697
Women are better.

28:19.699 --> 28:20.698
(laughter)

28:20.700 --> 28:22.066
I mean, the proof--

28:22.068 --> 28:23.634
It's right in front of us.

28:23.636 --> 28:26.070
If you think about
all of human history,

28:26.072 --> 28:29.206
Add up the wars
and the genocide,

28:29.208 --> 28:31.742
All the oppression,
the violence, the exploitation,

28:31.744 --> 28:36.046
The degradation
of the human spirit,

28:36.048 --> 28:38.582
What do all those things
have in common?

28:40.019 --> 28:41.485
Dudes.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.487
They have dudes
in common, right?

28:43.489 --> 28:44.588
Yeah.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.690
So maybe, just maybe,

28:46.692 --> 28:49.727
It's not just places
like wallace university

28:49.729 --> 28:51.995
That are better off
with a woman in charge.

28:51.997 --> 28:55.833
Maybe we'd be better off
if a woman was charge...

28:55.835 --> 28:56.900
All:
Everywhere!

28:56.902 --> 28:58.602
Exactly!

28:58.604 --> 29:01.004
(whooping, cheering)

29:01.006 --> 29:04.575
Thank you. Thank you.

29:04.577 --> 29:08.011
<i>The culture at this university</i>
<i>has been changed</i>

29:08.013 --> 29:09.513
<i>For the better.</i>

29:09.515 --> 29:11.849
<i>It's true, a lot of people</i>
<i>had to die</i>

29:11.851 --> 29:15.519
<i>To make that happen, but I</i>
<i>often catch myself thinking,</i>

29:15.521 --> 29:17.121
<i>"you know what?</i>

29:17.123 --> 29:18.789
<i>Maybe it was worth it."</i>

29:25.097 --> 29:27.898
Girls, I am thrilled

29:27.900 --> 29:29.299
That you've taken
the initiative

29:29.301 --> 29:31.969
To do the upkeep
for our new memorial.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.471
Well, we decided it was
the least kappa could do.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.107
Considering kappa is kind of
the reason they're all dead.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.475
Isn't it so beautiful?

29:38.477 --> 29:39.977
And so nice
of the radwells

29:39.979 --> 29:42.112
To donate the money
to commission it

29:42.114 --> 29:43.614
And have it built
so quickly?

29:43.616 --> 29:45.716
Yeah, I'm-I'm not sure

29:45.718 --> 29:48.418
I'm fully committed
to the design.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.955
Oh, and I should've never let
chad write the inscription.

29:51.957 --> 29:54.958
But I suppose money still talks.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.327
Yeah, well, we've
got to get going

29:57.329 --> 29:59.730
Because I am planning
a "get your yummies in

29:59.732 --> 30:01.231
And your feelings out" baking
party at the house tonight.

30:01.233 --> 30:02.933
We're gonna make
cookies and brownies,

30:02.935 --> 30:05.235
And eat them while we talk
about our feelings.

30:05.237 --> 30:08.105
Hester, you think you can
finish up the rest of this?

30:08.107 --> 30:09.506
Make sure my boy earl
gets some extra love.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.642
Yeah.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.912
Well, that just sounds awful.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.146
I don't know.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.948
I for one prefer
the saccharine banality of life

30:17.950 --> 30:20.117
Under grace and zayday
to the toxic sludge

30:20.119 --> 30:23.587
The chanels force-fed us every
day like we were pâtéd geese.

30:23.589 --> 30:25.522
Yeah, I suppose I agree.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.024
But what happened here

30:27.026 --> 30:29.326
To those poor kids
and the others was...

30:29.328 --> 30:31.328
Was truly awful.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.096
I mean, it was
an american tragedy.

30:34.366 --> 30:37.367
At least some good came out
of all of that evil.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.002
Oh, more than some, dean.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.204
I-I read your best-selling

30:40.206 --> 30:42.139
<i>New york times</i> book
three times.

30:42.141 --> 30:45.209
Th-these kids were
martyrs for a much bigger cause.

30:49.548 --> 30:53.183
I know it was you, hester.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.952
I remember
that little girl's face

30:54.954 --> 30:56.687
In the bathroom that night.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.958
Burned into my memory,

31:00.960 --> 31:04.194
Like joe theismann's injury
and<i> two girls one cup.</i>

31:04.196 --> 31:08.899
I remember every detail
of her little face.

31:08.901 --> 31:10.500
And I certainly would know

31:10.502 --> 31:12.636
What she would look like
all grown up.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.308
It's not my fault that all
of that happened to me.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.310
You see how
awesome wes is.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.980
He would've been my dad.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.515
I would've had a good life.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.050
Maybe if I would've
had a real dad,

31:27.052 --> 31:28.919
My brother wouldn't have
turned into such a douche.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.153
Maybe family
trips to ski

31:30.155 --> 31:32.155
In innsbruck
or to williamstown to see

31:32.157 --> 31:34.358
Tim daly in<i> death of a salesman</i>
would've turned me

31:34.360 --> 31:36.994
Into a much more sane
young woman.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.495
But that didn't happen.

31:38.497 --> 31:39.997
And I can't be blamed

31:39.999 --> 31:42.165
For the painful circumstances
of my upbringing.

31:42.167 --> 31:44.501
No, but those kids died.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.503
They're dead.

31:46.505 --> 31:47.905
And that is your fault.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.606
I didn't kill any of these kids.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.875
Except for pete, but he's
a killer, so that's allowed.

31:51.877 --> 31:53.510
By the state, hester.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.679
After a trial

31:55.681 --> 31:57.114
And lengthy appeals

31:57.116 --> 31:59.383
And using drugs
that are mostly painless.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.351
It all worked out, dean.

32:01.353 --> 32:02.953
And I'm never
gonna kill again.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.454
As long as I'm not
texting and driving.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.056
Everyone got

32:06.058 --> 32:07.791
What they wanted.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.192
And even if the chanels

32:09.194 --> 32:11.061
Didn't actually kill
any of these people,

32:11.063 --> 32:13.297
They perpetuated the system
that created me

32:13.299 --> 32:16.300
And my brother,
pete and gigi.

32:16.302 --> 32:19.536
So if anyone should pay
for this, it should be them.

32:19.538 --> 32:22.039
I also have a conscience,

32:22.041 --> 32:25.976
And a responsibility
to all those dead kids,

32:25.978 --> 32:29.880
That their killer
be brought to justice.

32:29.882 --> 32:33.650
So I am gonna
turn you in, hester.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.955
Then I'm gonna turn you in,

32:37.957 --> 32:40.958
For covering up
the murder of my mother

32:40.960 --> 32:43.393
And killing your ex-husband.

32:45.397 --> 32:48.332
(whispers): Or we could
just say we're good...

32:48.334 --> 32:49.633
And move on.

32:51.170 --> 32:55.339
To our very happy
and successful

32:55.341 --> 32:57.541
Best-selling lives.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.014
Okay.

33:04.016 --> 33:05.182
Okay, great.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.450
Take care.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.318
You, too. See ya.

33:19.932 --> 33:21.765
Grace:
This is the "sophia doyle

33:21.767 --> 33:24.601
I just had a baby and don't know
what to do" hotline center.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.604
Now, any girl in the situation
that sophia found herself in

33:27.606 --> 33:29.806
In that bathtub 20 years ago
has a lifeline.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.875
Someone she can call for help.

33:31.876 --> 33:33.943
I mean, of course, the girls who
find her can also call as well.

33:33.946 --> 33:35.379
We just want to make sure

33:35.381 --> 33:38.048
That nothing like this
ever happens on campus again.

33:38.050 --> 33:39.349
Yeah.

33:39.351 --> 33:42.152
Well, it certainly
is specific.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.153
Yeah.

33:43.155 --> 33:44.721
How's it going so far?

33:44.723 --> 33:46.056
Um...

33:46.058 --> 33:48.025
Not a lot of activity yet.

33:48.027 --> 33:50.827
Right.
Yeah.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.562
Well, you know,
with all the changes

33:52.564 --> 33:54.731
That you guys have facilitated
all over the campus,

33:54.733 --> 33:57.467
Maybe the next girl who has
surprise twins at a party

33:57.469 --> 33:59.036
Won't have to
call for help.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.637
Her friends will
just now know

34:00.639 --> 34:02.039
Not to let her
bleed to death,

34:02.041 --> 34:03.907
Because it's the
right thing to do.

34:03.909 --> 34:05.642
(sighs softly)

34:05.644 --> 34:07.644
Hey.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.813
Um, I'm really
proud of you, gracie.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.083
I-I want to give you a present.

34:13.085 --> 34:14.551
Something to acknowledge,
you know,

34:14.553 --> 34:16.019
All the hard work
that you've done this year.

34:16.021 --> 34:18.088
Wait, dad.

34:18.090 --> 34:20.023
Are you getting me a car?

34:20.025 --> 34:21.992
What? No.

34:21.994 --> 34:23.093
No.

34:23.095 --> 34:24.094
No, what-what...

34:24.096 --> 34:25.262
Are you out of your mind?

34:25.264 --> 34:26.930
No. No. Trust.

34:26.932 --> 34:29.332
Trust, gracie.
I-I'm giving you my trust.

34:29.334 --> 34:30.434
Oh.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.903
Oh, well, that's cool, too.

34:32.905 --> 34:34.004
Yeah.

34:34.006 --> 34:36.339
You know, I-I just,
I-I never...

34:36.341 --> 34:39.076
I never actually gave you
the chance to matriculate here.

34:39.078 --> 34:41.278
I mean, as a student,
sure, but not as a woman.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.713
I mean, I was stalking you
outside of the sorority house,

34:43.715 --> 34:47.050
I got a job in the department
so I could keep my eye on you.

34:47.052 --> 34:50.520
And I never really trusted you
to take care of yourself.

34:50.522 --> 34:55.058
Well, clearly,
I was wrong about that.

34:55.060 --> 34:56.693
So does this mean
you're leaving?

34:56.695 --> 34:58.195
Well, dean munsch, um...

34:58.197 --> 34:59.463
(laughs)

34:59.465 --> 35:01.098
...Cathy, uh...

35:01.100 --> 35:03.100
I can't stop calling her that,
especially because

35:03.102 --> 35:05.202
She likes me to call her
"dean munsch" in bed.

35:05.204 --> 35:06.770
Uh, anyway,
cathy and I,

35:06.772 --> 35:08.572
We're going to napa
for a couple of weeks.

35:08.574 --> 35:10.607
We're gonna, we're gonna
suck down some deep cabs,

35:10.609 --> 35:13.610
Eat some rich blues and...
Well, I don't know,

35:13.612 --> 35:15.946
Pretend to make,
uh, a lot of babies.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.647
(chuckles)
mm.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.151
I think you need your space.

35:21.153 --> 35:22.385
You've earned it.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.187
I love you, dad.

35:27.126 --> 35:29.159
Should we do one of
our counting good-byes?

35:29.161 --> 35:31.294
No, that's just
for sad good-byes.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.996
Okay.

35:32.998 --> 35:34.164
One, two, three.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.566
One, two, three.
Dad...

35:39.138 --> 35:40.170
(sighs)

35:40.172 --> 35:42.005
Bailiff:
<i>All rise.</i>

35:45.911 --> 35:47.210
Be seated.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.813
Judge:
Has the jury

35:49.815 --> 35:50.780
Reached a verdict?

35:50.782 --> 35:51.781
We have, your honor.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.150
We, the jury,

35:53.152 --> 35:55.352
Find the defendants...

35:55.354 --> 35:57.287
Objection!

35:57.289 --> 35:59.156
There is no more objections.
The trial is over.

35:59.158 --> 36:00.690
What? When did
that happen?

36:00.692 --> 36:02.826
You were asleep.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.162
Judge joe brown,
we, the chanels,

36:05.164 --> 36:07.831
Hereby declare
this trial a farce.

36:07.833 --> 36:11.868
I was under the impression that
I had the inalienable right

36:11.870 --> 36:13.470
To a jury of my peers.

36:13.472 --> 36:14.804
Look at these hippos.

36:14.806 --> 36:15.805
These are not

36:15.807 --> 36:17.641
My peers.

36:17.643 --> 36:20.177
I'm a hot, rich, skinny chick,
which makes me

36:20.179 --> 36:22.946
Entitled to a jury of
hot, rich, skinny chicks

36:22.948 --> 36:24.214
To see how awesome I am

36:24.216 --> 36:26.850
And to see that
the three of us

36:26.852 --> 36:28.485
Are innocent!

36:28.487 --> 36:29.819
Your-your honor!

36:29.821 --> 36:31.488
We, the jury,

36:31.490 --> 36:35.058
Find that the defendants
are guilty on all

36:35.060 --> 36:36.860
47 counts.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.128
(gallery murmuring)

36:38.130 --> 36:39.429
(shrieks)

36:40.999 --> 36:42.999
(shrieking, gavel pounding)

36:43.001 --> 36:44.067
Order in the court!

36:44.069 --> 36:45.168
Deal with that.
Order.

36:45.170 --> 36:47.904
This is a travesty,
judge mathis.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.073
This is a kangaroo court.

36:50.075 --> 36:53.076
And I am choosing
to ignore this verdict.

36:53.078 --> 36:54.678
What?
You can't ignore the verdict.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.912
What verdict?

36:55.914 --> 36:57.514
See, this is me
ignoring the verdict.

36:57.516 --> 36:58.815
For, like,

36:58.817 --> 37:00.417
The millionth time,

37:00.419 --> 37:02.919
My dad is super gross rich.

37:02.921 --> 37:04.321
Like, disgusting rich.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.890
He'll have me out of
prison in no time.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.491
Chanel, your parents
abandoned you.

37:08.493 --> 37:11.094
They legally disowned you
three weeks ago

37:11.096 --> 37:13.930
And filed an amicus brief
with the prosecution,

37:13.932 --> 37:16.533
Stating that they think
that you are a serial killer.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.668
They also want to
sue you for the time

37:18.670 --> 37:20.537
That you drove your range rover
into their living room

37:20.539 --> 37:23.006
Because you didn't want to walk
all the way up the driveway.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.941
(choked up):
It is such a long driveway.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.443
Don't worry,
ms. Oberlin.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.378
You ladies are not
going to prison.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.380
Thank you. (chuckles)

37:30.382 --> 37:32.582
You're going to an asylum.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.783
What?!

37:33.785 --> 37:35.785
(gallery applauding)

37:35.787 --> 37:37.254
You know, you three

37:37.256 --> 37:39.189
Are the worst
human beings

37:39.191 --> 37:41.124
That I have ever encountered.

37:41.126 --> 37:43.293
You have absolutely
no regard

37:43.295 --> 37:45.262
For anyone but yourselves.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.930
You're rude, entitled,

37:46.932 --> 37:50.300
Narcissistic, racist and insane.

37:50.302 --> 37:52.702
You elected to
represent yourselves

37:52.704 --> 37:54.904
In a capital murder case,

37:54.906 --> 37:57.941
Despite lacking even a basic
understanding of the law.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.543
And then, you-you mostly

38:00.545 --> 38:02.245
Slept through
your own trial.

38:02.247 --> 38:03.213
That's crazy.

38:03.215 --> 38:05.215
Your entire defense

38:05.217 --> 38:06.950
Consisted of you
screaming at the jury

38:06.952 --> 38:08.318
That you didn't
kill anybody

38:08.320 --> 38:09.953
And then threatening
to kill them

38:09.955 --> 38:11.221
If they found
you guilty.

38:11.223 --> 38:14.257
That is crazy behavior.

38:14.259 --> 38:15.392
Chanel,

38:15.394 --> 38:16.259
You're crazy!

38:16.261 --> 38:18.128
Ladies, please stand.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.763
(sighs)

38:19.765 --> 38:20.997
Stand up!

38:20.999 --> 38:23.233
(groans)

38:23.235 --> 38:25.635
Judge:
Chanel oberlin, sadie swenson,

38:25.637 --> 38:26.636
Libby putney...

38:26.638 --> 38:28.405
(chanel laughs)

38:28.407 --> 38:31.174
I'm sorry, I keep forgetting
your real name is libby putney.

38:31.176 --> 38:32.642
Judge:
I sentence you

38:32.644 --> 38:36.179
To life in prison
at the palmer asylum

38:36.181 --> 38:37.647
For the insane!
