WEBVTT

00:04.770 --> 00:07.073

Hey.


00:04.770 --> 00:07.073

Oh, hey.


00:07.107 --> 00:11.744

Forgive me if this comes off as
rude, but who the hell are you?


00:11.778 --> 00:14.214

Im Kyle. I go to school
with Shannon.


00:14.246 --> 00:15.448

Did you sleep here?


00:15.481 --> 00:17.684

Yeah. Want some eggs?


00:19.152 --> 00:22.655

Hey, babe,
I was thinking...


00:24.890 --> 00:27.493

What is that?


00:27.527 --> 00:30.396

That is a Kyle.
It spent the night.


00:32.399 --> 00:34.834

It spent the night?


00:34.868 --> 00:37.137

Want some eggs?


00:37.170 --> 00:40.372

Nobody wants your
runny-ass eggs, man.


00:41.908 --> 00:43.710

Morning. Oh, hey, Kyle.


00:43.743 --> 00:45.512

What are you
still doing here?


00:45.545 --> 00:47.112

Thought you left.


00:47.146 --> 00:49.448

I got hungry.
I made you some eggs.


00:47.146 --> 00:49.448

Aw.


00:49.481 --> 00:51.784

Ill see you
at school tomorrow.


00:51.817 --> 00:53.152

Bye.


00:53.185 --> 00:55.121

Bye.


00:55.155 --> 00:57.090

How cute is he?!


00:59.491 --> 01:01.261

He made me eggs!
He made me eggs!


01:01.293 --> 01:02.862

He made me eggs!


01:04.263 --> 01:06.231

I dont care how cute he is--


01:06.266 --> 01:09.234

and the boy is cute-- she
cannot have guys sleep over.


01:09.269 --> 01:11.870

I know, but I cant
just tell her that.


01:11.905 --> 01:13.472

Why not?
For one,


01:13.506 --> 01:16.609

when I was her age,
I had guys sleep over


01:16.643 --> 01:19.512

all... occasionally.


01:20.947 --> 01:22.549

The problem is


01:22.581 --> 01:24.783

I cant tell Shannon what to do
because Im her sister,


01:24.817 --> 01:26.486

not her mom.


01:26.519 --> 01:28.320

But your sister
is living with us,


01:28.353 --> 01:31.323

and if shes gonna stay here,
she has to play by our rules.


01:31.356 --> 01:32.692

Yeah, but she doesnt
have to stay here.


01:32.724 --> 01:33.960

If were too strict with her,


01:33.992 --> 01:36.930

she might move out and go back
to my dads or God knows where.


01:36.962 --> 01:39.799

Which we...
Dont want.


01:39.832 --> 01:41.935

Dont want.


01:41.968 --> 01:43.735

But we do have to talk to her.


01:43.770 --> 01:45.572

Absolutely. (sighs)


01:45.604 --> 01:48.674

But look on the bright side:
after living with my sister,


01:48.707 --> 01:50.843

our kids are gonna
seem like a breeze.


01:50.877 --> 01:53.412

Our kids? We can barely
deal with Shannon.


01:53.445 --> 01:55.515

Th-Theres no way I can imagine
kids of our own.


01:55.548 --> 01:56.816

Okay, Nick, I got it.


01:56.849 --> 01:58.585

Im just saying. Look,


01:58.617 --> 02:00.519

well have kids
in a few years. Right?


02:00.552 --> 02:01.754

After Shannon
goes to college,


02:01.787 --> 02:04.590

or... jail.


02:04.623 --> 02:06.225

Besides,


02:06.259 --> 02:10.362

I am too young for this
to turn into a dad bod.


02:10.396 --> 02:14.867

Yeah, because


02:10.396 --> 02:14.867

<i>your</i>


02:10.396 --> 02:14.867

body is
the one that will take the hit.


02:17.704 --> 02:19.705

â™ª


02:24.711 --> 02:26.812

This is a sensitive
conversation, Nick,


02:26.846 --> 02:28.548

so just let me handle it.


02:28.580 --> 02:31.317

Clem, shes your sister; theres
no way Im getting involved.


02:31.350 --> 02:34.521

Im gonna nod silently and agree
with everything you say.


02:34.554 --> 02:35.754

Perfect.


02:35.788 --> 02:37.656

Shannon?


02:37.689 --> 02:39.224

Sup?


02:39.259 --> 02:41.793

You cannot have guys
sleep over here!


02:42.961 --> 02:44.663

Nick!


02:44.697 --> 02:47.599

And the silent nodding
starts now.


02:49.269 --> 02:51.538

Look, I know Nick can be
a little old-fashioned,


02:51.570 --> 02:52.906

but I agree with him.


02:52.938 --> 02:54.706

Im not happy that Kyle
slept over either.


02:54.740 --> 02:58.010

Oh, my God!
We didnt even do anything.


02:58.043 --> 02:59.945

He got drunk
and passed out,


02:59.978 --> 03:02.681

so I bought a bunch of stuff
on his Amazon account.


03:02.715 --> 03:04.717

I got you guys a new spatula.


03:06.286 --> 03:07.486

Happy?


03:07.520 --> 03:09.955

Not even a little bit.


03:07.520 --> 03:09.955

I mean, we did
need a new spatula.


03:09.989 --> 03:13.259

Look, Kyle isnt just
some rando.


03:13.293 --> 03:14.760

I actually really like this guy.


03:14.794 --> 03:16.361

He was the first person


03:16.396 --> 03:18.031

to be nice to me
at my new school.


03:18.063 --> 03:20.332

Plus, hes handsome,
hes good-looking,


03:20.365 --> 03:23.269

and hes, like, really hot.


03:23.302 --> 03:26.506

Look, Shannon,
I worry about you.


03:26.538 --> 03:27.840

And having guys sleep over,


03:27.873 --> 03:29.442

its just asking
for trouble.


03:29.474 --> 03:31.978

When my mom had me,
she was way too young,


03:32.010 --> 03:33.746

and it ruined her life.


03:33.780 --> 03:36.415

What makes you think that?


03:33.780 --> 03:36.415

She told me.


03:38.084 --> 03:40.520

Well, look, Im not gonna
get pregnant, okay?


03:40.552 --> 03:41.987

(laughs):
Im not an idiot.


03:42.021 --> 03:46.491

Would an idiot be getting
almost a "C" in Algebra?


03:46.526 --> 03:49.329

What do you mean "almost"?
Youre getting a "D" in Algebra?


03:49.361 --> 03:50.796

Almost.


03:52.365 --> 03:54.567

Im sorry, but it feels like
you guys are having a problem


03:54.600 --> 03:56.301

with everything I do
since I moved in.


03:56.336 --> 03:57.870

Thats not true.


03:57.903 --> 03:59.938

I found my favorite eyeliner
in your underwear drawer,


03:59.973 --> 04:01.707

and I didnt say a thing.


04:01.741 --> 04:03.075

You were looking
through my drawers?


04:03.109 --> 04:04.409

What? No.


04:04.443 --> 04:06.746

No, that would be-- No.


04:06.778 --> 04:08.348

I was putting away your laundry.


04:08.381 --> 04:10.082

Yeah, you dont
put away my laundry.


04:10.115 --> 04:11.550

You leave it on the floor,


04:11.584 --> 04:14.086

hoping Ill get the message,
but I never do.


04:14.120 --> 04:18.358

Look, I really appreciate you
guys letting me live here. I do.


04:18.391 --> 04:20.959

(chuckles):
But I also need my privacy.


04:20.994 --> 04:23.329

And I dont think
thats such an insane request.


04:23.362 --> 04:25.932

Fine. You want privacy?


04:25.964 --> 04:28.834

You promise no more guys
sleeping over,


04:28.867 --> 04:32.338

Ill promise
no more snooping. Deal?


04:32.372 --> 04:35.875

Fine. You got yourself a deal.


04:37.877 --> 04:40.446

Oh, my God, no. Dude,
of course no ones seen it.


04:40.480 --> 04:41.713

Yeah, its
in my room.


04:41.747 --> 04:43.016

Oh, its in my drawer.


04:43.048 --> 04:44.350

(whispers):
Whats in her drawer?


04:44.384 --> 04:46.552

Oh. Hi.


04:46.586 --> 04:48.588

BOTH:
Hi.


04:48.620 --> 04:50.088

Thought you guys went to work.


04:50.122 --> 04:52.391

Still here.
Not yet.


04:52.425 --> 04:56.095

Okay. Well...


04:56.129 --> 04:58.096

Im gonna go to school. Bye.


04:58.130 --> 05:00.500

Have a good day.


05:00.533 --> 05:02.601

Oh, my God,
you have no idea...


05:05.504 --> 05:07.105

Dont do it, Clem.


05:07.139 --> 05:08.507

Do what, Nick?


05:08.540 --> 05:09.608

Snoop in her room.
(sighs)


05:09.641 --> 05:11.778

Look, the way I was raised,
when you make a deal,


05:11.810 --> 05:12.944

you stick by it.


05:12.978 --> 05:14.480

So if you want
Shannon to respect


05:14.514 --> 05:16.048

the rules, you have to
respect them, too.


05:16.081 --> 05:18.884

(sighs) Why do you have to be
so damn ethical?


05:18.918 --> 05:20.920

Oh, come on, you know
it gets you all hot


05:20.952 --> 05:22.988

when your boys
all ethical.


05:23.021 --> 05:25.957

Youre right, it kind of does.


05:23.021 --> 05:25.957

(laughs)


05:25.992 --> 05:28.795

See you tonight.
Okay.


05:28.827 --> 05:31.596

(sighs)


05:36.935 --> 05:39.572

Ah, dont do it.
What?


05:39.605 --> 05:41.007

(chuckles) I wasnt.


05:42.908 --> 05:44.744

(sighs)


05:44.776 --> 05:48.413

You hid a pregnancy test in
your room to catch her snooping?


05:48.447 --> 05:49.816

Yup.


05:49.848 --> 05:52.552

And the best part is,
when Clem finds it,


05:52.584 --> 05:54.120

itll prove she broke our deal,


05:54.153 --> 05:58.925

which means I can have Kyle
sleep over anytime I want.


05:58.957 --> 06:01.927

So wait, howd you get
a positive pregnancy test?


06:01.961 --> 06:03.995

Mm. Okay, so first thing
I did was I asked


06:04.029 --> 06:05.997

this pregnant girl in my
homeroom, right, for some pee...


06:06.031 --> 06:08.867

Mm-hmm.


06:06.031 --> 06:08.867

...but she was like, "Go away."


06:08.901 --> 06:10.737

BOTH:
Rude.


06:10.769 --> 06:12.038

So then I googled it...


06:10.769 --> 06:12.038

Yeah.


06:12.071 --> 06:13.105

...and, what do you know,


06:13.139 --> 06:16.975

pouring Coke on a pregnancy test
turns it positive.


06:17.009 --> 06:19.512

(scoffs) And youre sure
your sisters gonna find it?


06:19.545 --> 06:22.615

After the phone call I faked
this morning, definitely.


06:22.648 --> 06:24.550

This is such a great idea.


06:24.584 --> 06:26.151

I might pull it
on my stupid stepmom.


06:26.185 --> 06:28.588

Dude, dude, you should get
two positive pregnancy tests


06:28.620 --> 06:29.956

for her to find...


06:28.620 --> 06:29.956

Yeah.


06:29.988 --> 06:33.625

...and then shell think
youre having twins.


06:36.129 --> 06:38.497

(sighs):
Oh, dear God.


06:43.502 --> 06:45.004

Okay.


06:47.005 --> 06:49.641

Come on, Shannon.


06:49.675 --> 06:51.177

(sighs)


06:52.778 --> 06:54.781

(groans)


06:58.683 --> 07:00.185

Oh, God, no.


07:03.088 --> 07:06.658

Please dont be a plus.
Please dont be a plus.


07:06.692 --> 07:09.762

Please dont be a plus.


07:09.795 --> 07:11.663

(screaming)


07:19.004 --> 07:20.939

Hey, sweetie.


07:20.973 --> 07:22.641

Ben, thank you
so much for coming.


07:22.675 --> 07:24.877

Nick is teaching, and I didnt
know who else to call.


07:24.911 --> 07:27.279

Well, it better be important.
I had to get another instructor


07:27.312 --> 07:29.981

to cover my SoulCycle
class for this.


07:30.016 --> 07:32.250

Do you have any idea how
upset people are gonna be


07:32.284 --> 07:35.721

when they walk in
and see Michelle?


07:35.754 --> 07:37.990

Whats wrong with Michelle?


07:38.024 --> 07:39.625

Everything!


07:39.658 --> 07:40.659

(exhales)


07:40.692 --> 07:42.261

So whats going on?


07:42.295 --> 07:45.130

My sister is pregnant.


07:45.163 --> 07:47.165

What?


07:47.199 --> 07:49.735

Shannon is pregnant.


07:49.769 --> 07:53.105

Girl, I am shocked.


07:53.139 --> 07:56.209

No, Im not. No, its actually
an incredibly easy buy.


07:56.242 --> 07:57.843

Wait, when did
she tell you?


07:57.877 --> 07:59.678

She didnt.
I was snooping in her room--


07:59.711 --> 08:01.980

even though I made a deal
with her that I wouldnt--


08:02.014 --> 08:04.317

and I found the pregnancy test
in one of her drawers,


08:04.350 --> 08:05.985

and now I dont know what to do.


08:06.017 --> 08:08.221

You know, this whole
thing reminds me


08:08.254 --> 08:10.223

of when my parents
found out I was gay.


08:11.624 --> 08:13.259

Mom was hanging
clothes in my closet


08:13.291 --> 08:17.896

and found a DVD of<i>
Hung Jury: 12 Man-gry Men.</i>


08:17.930 --> 08:20.098

And then they told you
that they knew?


08:20.132 --> 08:21.266

Are you kidding?
My parents were amazing.


08:21.300 --> 08:24.036

They didnt say a thing.
They just went out of their way


08:24.069 --> 08:26.639

to let me know that they were
there for me, no matter what.


08:26.672 --> 08:27.807

No judgment.


08:27.839 --> 08:30.042

So youre saying
thats what I should do


08:30.076 --> 08:32.245

so that Shannon will tell me
about the pregnancy?


08:32.278 --> 08:36.215

Actually, I was just telling
a story about myself.


08:36.249 --> 08:40.152

All right, so I am going
to make sure that Shannon knows


08:40.186 --> 08:43.088

that Im there for her, and then
wait for her to come to me.


08:43.121 --> 08:44.890

Exactly, and
before you know it,


08:44.923 --> 08:47.192

shell be pulling the pregnancy
test out of that drawer, and...


08:47.225 --> 08:48.995

Oh, God.
What?


08:49.028 --> 08:51.096

After I found it,


08:51.129 --> 08:52.999

I was walking around
my apartment in a daze,


08:53.032 --> 08:55.600

and I think I may have left it
on the kitchen counter,


08:55.634 --> 08:58.671

so I need to go home right now
before she comes home


08:58.703 --> 09:00.806

and finds it.


08:58.703 --> 09:00.806

Oh. Okay.


09:00.840 --> 09:03.241

So glad we didnt just
do this over the phone.


09:03.275 --> 09:04.844

Im sorry. I love you.
Thank you.


09:04.876 --> 09:06.111

Bye. Mwah.


09:04.876 --> 09:06.111

Love you.


09:16.121 --> 09:17.590

(sighs)


09:28.200 --> 09:30.302

Oh, my God.


09:37.243 --> 09:38.744

Yeah.


09:42.280 --> 09:44.250

(doorbell rings)


09:44.283 --> 09:45.317

Hey, son.


09:45.350 --> 09:46.751

What you doing here?


09:46.786 --> 09:49.388

I, uh, I have some big news.


09:49.422 --> 09:50.923

Youre finally gonna
shave that beard


09:50.956 --> 09:52.991

that makes you look like
that genie from


09:50.956 --> 09:52.991

<i>Aladdin?</i>


09:53.024 --> 09:54.994

Oh, Walt.


09:55.027 --> 09:56.729

Whats going on, honey?


09:56.761 --> 09:59.331

Guys... Clems pregnant.


09:59.365 --> 10:02.668

Yes!


10:02.701 --> 10:04.003

Yes, yes!


10:04.035 --> 10:05.904

Yes, yes!


10:05.937 --> 10:09.075

Im gonna be a grandma!


10:09.107 --> 10:10.676

Im happy for you,
too, son.


10:10.710 --> 10:14.046

Im just showing it in
a less absolutely insane way.


10:14.080 --> 10:16.248

So, come on, sit,
sit, come on, sit.


10:16.282 --> 10:19.085

So, how did
Clem tell you?


10:19.118 --> 10:20.852

Thats the thing; she hasnt.


10:20.885 --> 10:22.754

She left the pregnancy test
on the kitchen counter


10:22.788 --> 10:25.423

for me to find because I-I think
shes afraid to tell me.


10:25.457 --> 10:28.126

Why would she be afraid to tell
you that shes gonna have a b...


10:28.159 --> 10:31.129

Baby!


10:33.399 --> 10:35.868

I actually think she was
trying to tell me yesterday


10:35.900 --> 10:38.203

by bringing up
us having kids,


10:38.236 --> 10:42.008

but she stopped because I made
her feel like I wasnt ready,


10:42.040 --> 10:44.442

because Im not.


10:42.040 --> 10:44.442

(gasps) Shut your mouth!


10:46.879 --> 10:49.315

I mean, lets discuss


10:49.347 --> 10:52.485

why is it
that you feel this way.


10:52.518 --> 10:55.254

I dont know.
You know?


10:55.287 --> 10:56.855

The plan was to
wait a few years.


10:56.889 --> 10:57.856

And this is all
happening so fast.


10:57.889 --> 11:00.426

I mean, I just signed up
for a softball league.


11:00.458 --> 11:02.961

Am I gonna be able
to do that?


11:02.995 --> 11:05.130

Trust me, when it comes
to having kids,


11:05.163 --> 11:07.133

no one is ever truly ready.


11:07.166 --> 11:09.134

And then your baby is born,


11:09.168 --> 11:11.803

and you see
that perfect little face,


11:11.836 --> 11:13.972

and it just fills
your heart with joy.


11:14.005 --> 11:16.241

And that feeling
never goes away.


11:16.274 --> 11:18.244

And then they grow up.


11:19.845 --> 11:22.447

And cover that face
with a weird beard.


11:24.049 --> 11:28.153

Sweetheart, you are ready
to have this baby.


11:28.187 --> 11:29.455

You really think so?


11:29.488 --> 11:30.923

Are you kidding?


11:30.956 --> 11:33.024

You are gonna be
a fantastic father.


11:33.058 --> 11:35.894

Absolutely.


11:35.927 --> 11:38.230

You know what,
maybe I can do this.


11:38.264 --> 11:40.932

I do have a lot of knowledge
to pass on.


11:40.966 --> 11:43.335

Plus, itd be nice to
have a little wingman.


11:45.071 --> 11:46.806

Cause Im starting to get
a lot of weird looks


11:46.838 --> 11:49.140

when I go to
Pixar movies alone.


11:49.174 --> 11:50.341

(phone chimes)


11:52.445 --> 11:54.212

Oh, its Clem.
Oh.


11:54.245 --> 11:56.048

She wants to talk.
Mm-hmm.


11:56.081 --> 11:57.982

You know what, Im gonna
go home and let her know


11:58.017 --> 11:59.317

that she has nothing
to worry about.


11:59.350 --> 12:01.086

I am ready to be a father.


12:01.120 --> 12:02.153

(laughs)
Mm.


12:02.187 --> 12:03.221

Thanks, guys.


12:03.254 --> 12:04.322

Yeah. (laughs)


12:03.254 --> 12:04.322

Ooh.


12:04.355 --> 12:06.057

And Im ready, too.


12:06.091 --> 12:08.827

Ive got a whole closet
full of baby clothes,


12:08.860 --> 12:10.995

folded and ready to go.


12:11.029 --> 12:13.399

Mom, you already
bought baby clothes?


12:13.432 --> 12:16.235

And pacifiers and a diaper genie
and a high chair.


12:16.268 --> 12:18.471

That is not true, Walt.


12:18.504 --> 12:23.174

Actually, the high chair is
still in my Buy Buy Baby cart.


12:23.208 --> 12:28.279

But with one click,
your baby can be sitting high!


12:28.313 --> 12:30.482

Mwah.


12:28.313 --> 12:30.482

All right.


12:35.287 --> 12:39.892

No judgment.
No judgment.


12:39.924 --> 12:41.126

Hey, Clem.


12:41.159 --> 12:43.394

Theres my favorite sister!


12:45.431 --> 12:47.032

Okay.


12:47.066 --> 12:48.267

Come in. Sit down.


12:48.299 --> 12:49.869

Put your feet up.
Do you want a snack?


12:49.902 --> 12:51.937

I can get you a snack.


12:51.971 --> 12:53.172

Why are you being so nice to me?


12:53.205 --> 12:56.542

Because I care about you.


12:56.575 --> 13:00.479

And I support you
no matter what.


13:00.513 --> 13:03.081

Thanks, Clem.
Thats real sweet.


13:03.115 --> 13:06.985

You know whats sweet?
Fresh-baked cookies.


13:09.288 --> 13:11.123

Nah, my stomachs blecch.


13:11.157 --> 13:12.258

Really?


13:12.291 --> 13:13.458

Must have been something I ate.


13:13.491 --> 13:16.629

Or maybe it was something else.


13:16.662 --> 13:19.264

Like what?
What else could it possibly be?


13:19.298 --> 13:22.634

I dont know.
Maybe youre...


13:22.668 --> 13:25.270

Maybe Im what?
What am I, Clem?


13:25.303 --> 13:27.139

It doesnt matter.


13:27.173 --> 13:30.375

But whatever it is,
you can tell me.


13:30.408 --> 13:32.610

Oh, God. Oh, no.


13:32.644 --> 13:35.114

(coughs)
No, Im gonna puke!


13:35.147 --> 13:37.081

Shannon?
Shannon?


13:37.115 --> 13:38.250

(retching)


13:41.052 --> 13:43.121

Hey, Shannon,
are you okay in there?


13:43.154 --> 13:44.190

Oh, Im fine.


13:44.222 --> 13:47.993

(retching dramatically)


13:48.027 --> 13:49.360

Just give me a minute.


13:49.394 --> 13:51.197

(retching dramatically)


13:52.530 --> 13:54.933

Oh.
Hey, babe.


13:54.966 --> 13:57.336

Good, youre home.
We need to talk.


13:57.369 --> 13:58.971

I know what you want
to talk about.


13:59.004 --> 13:59.971

You do?


14:00.004 --> 14:01.240

I found the pregnancy test,


14:01.273 --> 14:03.576

and-and sure, like, this might
be happening a little early...


14:03.609 --> 14:06.578

A little?
This is a disaster.


14:06.611 --> 14:08.913

And thats what I thought
at first, too, but now...


14:08.947 --> 14:10.448

now Im really, really happy.


14:10.481 --> 14:12.217

How could you be happy?


14:12.250 --> 14:15.386

We dont even know
who the father is.


14:18.190 --> 14:21.025

We dont know who the father is?


14:21.059 --> 14:22.293

(sighs)


14:22.327 --> 14:25.029

Yeah. I mean, it could be Kyle.


14:25.063 --> 14:27.566

How could it be Kyle?!


14:27.600 --> 14:30.436

I dont know, Nick.
It could be anyone.


14:30.469 --> 14:32.571

Excuse me?


14:32.605 --> 14:34.940

Why are you so surprised?


14:34.974 --> 14:36.408

Because I assumed
that I was the only person


14:36.442 --> 14:38.277

you were having sex with!


14:38.309 --> 14:41.312

What?


14:41.346 --> 14:42.480

No. (chuckles)


14:45.283 --> 14:47.952

I mean yes.


14:47.986 --> 14:49.687

(chuckles) Yes.


14:49.721 --> 14:51.690

No, sweetie.


14:51.724 --> 14:54.025

Sweetie, Im not pregnant.


14:54.058 --> 14:55.461

Shannon is pregnant.


14:55.494 --> 14:57.929

So, wait, youre not pregnant?


14:59.230 --> 15:01.734

Damn.


15:01.767 --> 15:05.037

Wait, Shannons pregnant? Damn!


15:05.070 --> 15:07.740

Yeah, but she doesnt know
that I know.


15:07.773 --> 15:10.208

Oh, yes, I do.


15:11.543 --> 15:14.113

Cause you snooped, you narc.


15:14.145 --> 15:17.383

Who cares that I snooped?
Youre pregnant.


15:19.551 --> 15:22.453

Oh, my God, youre not pregnant.


15:22.488 --> 15:24.990

No!


15:25.024 --> 15:28.626

That test was a fake
to prove you were snooping.


15:30.129 --> 15:31.397

Damn it, Shannon,


15:31.429 --> 15:34.232

I am so angry and so relieved,


15:34.265 --> 15:38.470

and so mad and so happy
all at the same time!


15:38.504 --> 15:41.506

Im texting Kyle,
because according to our deal,


15:41.539 --> 15:43.308

I get to have him sleep over.


15:43.341 --> 15:46.010

The eggplant emoji?


15:46.044 --> 15:48.279

Thats right.


15:48.313 --> 15:51.049

I have no idea what
that means, young lady,


15:51.082 --> 15:53.284

but that little punk
is not sleeping over,


15:53.318 --> 15:55.620

as gorgeous as he is.


15:55.653 --> 15:58.624

Yeah, Im sorry,
but we had a deal.


15:58.657 --> 16:00.392

And once you send
the eggplant emoji,


16:00.426 --> 16:02.628

theres, like,
no turning back.


16:02.660 --> 16:05.563

Yeah, well, screw the deal.


16:05.596 --> 16:07.265

This is


16:05.596 --> 16:07.265

<i>our</i>


16:05.596 --> 16:07.265

house.


16:07.298 --> 16:08.701

And, yes, you can leave
whenever you want,


16:08.734 --> 16:10.568

but as long as youre here
under this roof,


16:10.601 --> 16:12.136

what we say goes.


16:14.539 --> 16:16.240

Hypocrites.


16:19.778 --> 16:21.346

(door slams)


16:21.379 --> 16:22.815

Babe, I just,
I have one question.


16:22.847 --> 16:26.250

Yes, the eggplant is a penis.


16:28.287 --> 16:30.755

Well, then that means
Ive been flirting


16:30.788 --> 16:33.491

with my vegan
coworker Steven.


16:37.495 --> 16:39.498

(sighs)


16:40.365 --> 16:43.034

Shannon?


16:47.740 --> 16:50.576

Can you take your headphones off
so that you can hear me?


16:50.609 --> 16:54.413

Sorry, I cant hear you.
Im wearing headphones.


16:54.446 --> 16:56.081

Shannon.


16:58.149 --> 16:59.384

What?


16:59.418 --> 17:01.754

Im sorry that I
broke the deal. Okay?


17:01.787 --> 17:04.522

But I never should have
made it in the first place.


17:04.556 --> 17:06.191

Im new to this whole
parenting thing,


17:06.224 --> 17:07.659

and I dont really know
what Im doing.


17:07.692 --> 17:10.596

But all I know is that
Im responsible for you.


17:10.628 --> 17:12.397

Yeah, and its driving me crazy.


17:12.431 --> 17:14.298

Maybe I should just
move back in with Dad,


17:14.333 --> 17:16.567

and go back to my old school,
where the pregnant girls


17:16.602 --> 17:19.337

are nice and share their pee.


17:19.371 --> 17:21.839

You just want
to go back to Dads


17:21.874 --> 17:23.709

because he lets you do
whatever you want.


17:23.741 --> 17:26.211

Hey, now youre catching on.


17:26.244 --> 17:28.680

Well, thats not me.


17:28.713 --> 17:30.214

And while youre here,


17:30.249 --> 17:31.849

you dont get to do
whatever you want.


17:31.884 --> 17:33.818

Because Im watching out
for you, Shannon,


17:33.852 --> 17:36.555

which is something that Dad
never did for either of us.


17:36.587 --> 17:39.223

Yeah, well, maybe
thats what I want.


17:39.258 --> 17:41.226

Maybe it is.


17:41.259 --> 17:43.362

But just know that--


17:43.394 --> 17:45.364

Dad wasnt good at
saying this to us,


17:45.396 --> 17:47.900

but... I love you.


17:47.932 --> 17:49.701

I do.


17:49.734 --> 17:51.537

A lot.


17:51.569 --> 17:55.473

So just think about that
before you decide to go.


17:57.409 --> 17:59.778

(sighs)


18:06.351 --> 18:07.553

(door closes)


18:07.586 --> 18:10.221

So, howd it go?


18:10.255 --> 18:11.690

Terrible.


18:11.722 --> 18:14.460

I think shes gonna
go back to my Dads.


18:14.492 --> 18:15.827

Sorry, babe.


18:15.861 --> 18:17.729

Yeah, me, too.


18:17.762 --> 18:20.766

But, hey, you should be happy
that were not having a kid


18:20.798 --> 18:23.469

because I completely
suck at this.


18:24.502 --> 18:25.770

How dare you?!


18:25.804 --> 18:26.805

What? What did I do?


18:26.838 --> 18:29.641

You just had to pull out
the big guns, didnt you?


18:29.674 --> 18:32.443

Telling me you


18:29.674 --> 18:32.443

<i>love</i>


18:29.674 --> 18:32.443

me.


18:34.212 --> 18:35.413

Youre sick, you know that?


18:35.447 --> 18:37.281

Sick!


18:37.316 --> 18:39.718

So youre staying?


18:39.750 --> 18:41.353

Like I have a choice now.


18:41.385 --> 18:43.955

"I love you."
Who says these things?!


18:43.989 --> 18:46.224

I do.


18:46.258 --> 18:48.192

I do, too.


18:48.227 --> 18:50.328

Okay, whatever.


19:01.405 --> 19:02.708

(retches)


19:06.612 --> 19:09.347

Wait, am I good at this?


19:09.381 --> 19:11.782

Am I, like,


19:09.381 --> 19:11.782

<i>really</i>


19:09.381 --> 19:11.782

good at this?


19:11.817 --> 19:13.785

Girl, you are fantastic!


19:16.355 --> 19:17.788

(knock on door)


19:19.324 --> 19:20.959

Hey, Im here to see Shannon.


19:20.992 --> 19:22.728

Sorry, man, not happening.


19:22.760 --> 19:24.630

Bro, I dont think
you understand, okay?


19:24.663 --> 19:26.632

She sent me
the eggplant emoji.


19:26.664 --> 19:28.933

Its basically the Bat-Signal.


19:28.967 --> 19:30.736

If you dont leave right now,


19:30.769 --> 19:32.770

Im gonna send you
the cut-up cucumber emoji.


19:32.804 --> 19:34.772

Buh-bye.


19:34.806 --> 19:37.276

(singing)


19:40.511 --> 19:41.846

That was awesome.


19:41.880 --> 19:43.949

I cannot wait
to make a baby with you.


19:43.981 --> 19:44.982

Mm.


19:45.017 --> 19:47.885

But not for, like,
five to seven years, right?


19:47.920 --> 19:49.221

Minimum.
Mm.


19:56.295 --> 19:57.596

Okay, so let me
get this straight.


19:57.628 --> 20:00.932

Youre telling me
that no one is pregnant.


20:00.965 --> 20:03.035

Nope. Just Kimmie
from my homeroom.


20:03.067 --> 20:07.271

But no one in this room is,
if thats what youre asking.


20:07.306 --> 20:10.842

So, sweetheart,
gonna bring out that apple pie?


20:10.875 --> 20:12.411

Oh, that is why
we are here.


20:12.443 --> 20:14.011

Its my favorite thing
that she makes.


20:14.046 --> 20:16.682

Oh, really?
No pie for you.


20:18.549 --> 20:19.884

But I was looking
forward to that.


20:19.917 --> 20:21.987

Oh, did you get
your hopes up for something,


20:22.019 --> 20:24.522

just to have them
cruelly dashed?


20:24.556 --> 20:26.290

Cause I did!


20:26.325 --> 20:28.259

Excuse me.


20:29.661 --> 20:30.996

Mom, are you serious?


20:29.661 --> 20:30.996

ROSE: Im serious!
