He's back again.

MUSIC PLAYS LOUDLY

00:44.360 --> 00:46.400
GRUNTING

00:55.320 --> 01:00.120
You embarrassed my boy Spider
in public. That can't run.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.560
But I ain't unjust.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.880
Going forward, you turn
a blind eye, you get paid.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.160
No, thanks.
You got bare nerve.

01:12.760 --> 01:15.680
You know what? I could use you.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.400
Yo, you want a job?

01:19.760 --> 01:21.520
No, thank you.

01:21.520 --> 01:25.680
Very polite. Bet you don't
speak with your mouth full, either.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.680
All right!

01:29.840 --> 01:32.120
I'll turn a blind eye.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.360
But I don't want your money.

HE COUGHS

02:31.880 --> 02:33.440
KNOCK ON DOOR

02:35.760 --> 02:37.400
Christian Taylor?

02:40.840 --> 02:43.480
I'm not talking to you
without a solicitor.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.440
You're not under suspicion. You're
just helping us with our inquiries.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.520
I'm not helping you with anything
and I want my one phone call.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.960
You're not under arrest.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.320
Do you know who Christian really is?

02:54.320 --> 02:56.640
Do we ever truly know
who someone really is?

02:56.640 --> 03:00.040
Some days, I'm not sure
I even know who I really am.

03:01.720 --> 03:05.480
This is Christian Taylor.
He's the impostor.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.920
No, the man you know as
Christian Taylor is the impostor.

03:08.920 --> 03:12.560
Who's this guy? The real Christian
Taylor. And what's the question?

03:12.560 --> 03:15.320
Do you know who he is?
No, I've never seen him before.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.080
No, not... Not him.
Do you know who the impostor is?

03:19.080 --> 03:21.040
Well, you said his name
was Christian Taylor.

03:21.040 --> 03:25.040
Are you screwing with us?
Sergeant, why would I do that?

03:25.040 --> 03:28.080
I don't know which one is Christian,
which one is the impostor.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.000
I do know that one of them owes me
Â£4 for a sandwich, so do make sure

03:31.000 --> 03:32.920
you get that back
when you catch him.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.920
His name's not really Christian?
That makes a lot of sense, actually,

03:35.920 --> 03:39.720
because I called over to him
one time, I said, "Oh, can you
pass me that bin bag, Christian?"

03:39.720 --> 03:42.760
And he didn't even look round.
Although he was wearing headphones

03:42.760 --> 03:44.240
cos he was using a hedge trimmer,

03:44.240 --> 03:47.040
so that might have had something
to do with it. Is that useful?

03:47.040 --> 03:51.960
Probably won't stand up in court,
will it? Defence'll tear it to
shreds. Unless I'm the prosecution.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.240
Sorry, there's no place for humour
in a police interrogation.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.880
Do you know his real name? No.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.720
You never seen him
outside community service?

04:03.720 --> 04:06.680
No. You wouldn't consider him
a friend?

04:08.520 --> 04:10.000
No.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.240
Rani has no love for Christian.
She snitched on him twice.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.160
What I'm about to tell you,
it can't leave this room, OK?

04:17.160 --> 04:20.720
Diane, the gun you found was
used in a shooting.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.200
Gaaash!

04:24.960 --> 04:26.920
I mean, yes,

04:26.920 --> 04:32.320
I am glad I found the gun and can
help solve such a terrible crime.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.800
Your father's van was identified
at the scene of a drug robbery

04:35.800 --> 04:38.840
in which a masked figure
was seen holding a gun,

04:38.840 --> 04:41.920
a gun that bears a striking
resemblance to the one you claim

04:41.920 --> 04:45.920
you saw Christian hiding.
How do you account for that?

04:45.920 --> 04:47.920
I don't know - a coincidence?

04:47.920 --> 04:50.240
Quite a big coincidence,
wouldn't you say?

04:50.240 --> 04:54.040
Statistically, coincidences are more
common than you think. Is that so?

04:54.040 --> 04:57.280
In 2009, the Bulgarian lottery
announced the same six

04:57.280 --> 05:00.800
winning numbers on two consecutive
draws. People thought was a fix,

05:00.800 --> 05:03.400
the government investigated,
but no tampering was found.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.800
It was just a coincidence.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.800
Do you know it's a crime to lie
to the police? It's not a lie.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.760
Just Google "Bulgarian lottery".

05:12.480 --> 05:16.960
This is the man who was shot.
Tell me if you recognise him. Whoa!

05:16.960 --> 05:21.400
Is that tattoo permanent? I believe
so, yes. What if he has to go for

05:21.400 --> 05:24.120
a job interview or something? He's
not going for job interviews.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.880
Yeah, well,
not with that on his face.

05:25.880 --> 05:28.360
He is seriously limiting
his career options.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.160
I mean, teaching's out. Vicar?

05:31.160 --> 05:33.920
It's imperative we find the man
who's impersonating Christian.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.480
Leave it to me. He doesn't mean you
go and find him. I don't mind.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.080
I'm happy to help.
Diane, Mr Wild is right.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.760
But I would like it if you'd help me
build an E-FIT of the impostor.

05:43.760 --> 05:48.920
Yeah, no probs. I've got his face up
here. Clear as day. Good.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.560
SHE EXHALES

05:50.560 --> 05:53.600
If Christian makes contact with you,
call me. If you hear from Christian,

05:53.600 --> 05:56.560
give me a ring.
Christian calls you, call me.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.000
If you hear from Christian,
please contact me.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.960
You hear from Christian,
contact me ASAP.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.440
I want to know what you're up to -

06:06.440 --> 06:09.400
before I tell Diane you were
sneaking around in her office.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.840
If you were going to do that,
you'd have done it already.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.760
We're meeting at the placement at
4:00, then we're going to look
for Christian. Can you make it?

06:16.760 --> 06:20.200
That kid had a fake name and a gun.
Are you out of your bloody mind?

06:20.200 --> 06:22.240
I'll take that as a maybe.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.560
Sir, permission to speak freely?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.520
Don't have to ask permission.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.440
You know it's a longstanding dream
of mine to be a police detective,

06:38.440 --> 06:42.720
but my criminal record, of which
I am not proud, inhibits that dream.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.520
In a continuing effort to build
valuable credit to help support

06:45.520 --> 06:47.560
any future application
to the police,

06:47.560 --> 06:49.760
I would like your consent
to take the minibus

06:49.760 --> 06:52.640
and seek out the impostor who has
been posing as Christian Taylor.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.320
Sorry, I drifted off halfway
through that. What are you asking?

06:55.320 --> 06:57.840
To take the minibus to look
for Christian. Absolutely not.

06:57.840 --> 07:03.280
But, sir... Diane, you are never
going to be a police detective.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.640
Why don't you just stick to the work
you're actually paid for?

07:06.640 --> 07:12.040
Who knows, in five, ten years' time
you could be doing my job.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.520
No offence, sir...

07:15.520 --> 07:18.040
..but I don't want to end up
like you.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.880
I want to actually
do something with my life.

07:22.880 --> 07:27.280
Go home. Before for one of us says
something both of us might regret.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.880
ALARM CHIRPS

07:47.280 --> 07:48.720
You know this person?

07:51.040 --> 07:55.120
Seen him around. Any idea
why he's lying in a hospital bed?

07:55.120 --> 07:59.040
Is he finally getting
that stupid tattoo removed?

07:59.040 --> 08:03.480
You're currently doing community
service for failures to appear
in court. Is that right? Yeah.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.960
And I really feel like I'm giving
something back to the community.

08:06.960 --> 08:11.000
Can we cut the shit? Who are you
paying to do your hours?

08:11.000 --> 08:16.080
I don't know what you mean. Who are
you sending in your place? What?

08:16.080 --> 08:18.600
How would I expect
to get away with that?

08:18.600 --> 08:20.160
I'd have to believe

08:20.160 --> 08:22.120
you white people in law enforcement

08:22.120 --> 08:24.800
think all black people
look the same.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.360
What kind of cynical bastard
would I be to think

08:27.360 --> 08:31.120
police in this country
are racist, huh?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.920
I know who you are.

08:35.920 --> 08:38.160
I know you ran the Brook Hill crew.

08:38.160 --> 08:41.240
And I'm coming for you,
do you understand?

08:43.640 --> 08:45.120
Go.

08:55.600 --> 09:00.680
How'd you get into this, then?
Bit of a computer nerd?

09:00.680 --> 09:03.640
I ask cos I'm looking to join
the force myself.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.160
I mean, not as a desk jockey,
like you.

09:06.160 --> 09:09.480
Want to actually
make a difference.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.320
No offence.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.600
Yeah, OK, let me try that.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.880
Mm, eyes a bit closer together.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.640
How's it going? Oh, hello, ma'am.
Yeah, good, good.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.640
This is looking pretty close, yeah.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.680
I mean, I would say his lips
and his chin are a little bit

09:25.680 --> 09:29.040
more like Aston's from JLS. JLS?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.640
You don't know who JLS are?

09:31.640 --> 09:34.280
Runners-up from X Factor
series five.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.880
Do you not watch X Factor?
What do you watch, Strictly?

09:36.880 --> 09:40.960
I mean, Aston was on Strictly, too,
actually. He lost the dance off to
Mollie King from The Saturdays.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.080
It wasn't Aston's fault, it was his
partners. I mean, why would you do

09:44.080 --> 09:47.240
a Viennese waltz when it's
'70s Disco Week? Don't know.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.040
Yeah, I didn't know. Exactly.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.760
Oh, yeah. Spot on, that is.
Great. Brilliant.

09:52.760 --> 09:57.840
Can we just get this sent out
to all divisions ASAP? ASAP. Thanks.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.600
Well done, Diane.
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

10:10.800 --> 10:11.840
DOOR CLOSES

10:13.960 --> 10:15.440
Sit down, Frank.

10:26.480 --> 10:30.360
You've done a lot of mean
and selfish things over the years,

10:30.360 --> 10:34.320
and when you came back into our
lives, you promised you'd change,

10:34.320 --> 10:36.080
make amends.

10:36.080 --> 10:40.040
If I haven't been nice to you
it's cos I've had no faith in you.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.400
But you've proved me wrong.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.760
So I apologise.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.960
And when your ankle tag comes off,
Tom and Holly and me,

10:49.960 --> 10:52.520
we'd like you to stay here
with us permanently.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.280
I'd like that.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.000
I love you, Dad.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.080
Come and give Grandpa a hug.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.240
Come on, Tom.

11:29.480 --> 11:33.040
Greg Fried Rice! Working weekends?

11:33.040 --> 11:38.040
Yeah, just catching up on some
stuff. Do you know what I've been
thinking? We share a desk, right?

11:38.040 --> 11:41.960
We've never shared a beer.
We should get a drink sometime. OK.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.160
How about six o'clock? Today?
Yeah, they do a great ploughman's

11:45.160 --> 11:48.520
at the Bull. Do you like
ploughman's? I love ploughman's.

11:48.520 --> 11:52.960
I always ask for cheese...and ham.
Bit cheeky, isn't it?

11:52.960 --> 11:57.240
I got plans. Oh, cancel them.
I can't cancel them. Cancel them.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.440
I want to have a beer
and a ploughman's.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.120
And you should invite Howard Cherry.

12:01.120 --> 12:05.080
What? See you at six, mate.
Oh, and I hope you don't mind -

12:05.080 --> 12:07.840
I gave your cupboard
a little spring clean.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.520
Wouldn't like the partners
to see the mess it's in.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.600
Hello, Dad.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.080
Wasn't expecting you to be here.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.600
Everything OK?

12:50.280 --> 12:52.600
Where did the money come from?

12:52.600 --> 12:55.840
You know where the money came from.
You met Mr Cherry.

12:55.840 --> 13:00.360
I called your lawyers. They've never
heard of any Howard Cherry.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.680
Well, that-that makes no sense.
Don't lie to me!

13:02.680 --> 13:07.760
I can still beat the tar out of you.
I'm not lying. I know he's a fraud!

13:07.760 --> 13:10.360
I saw you picking up rubbish
with him, for God's sake!

13:10.360 --> 13:13.000
Now, where did the money come from?

13:15.320 --> 13:17.200
We found it. Stop lying!

13:17.200 --> 13:22.000
I'm not lying! Dad, some gang kid
hid a bag of money and we found it.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.760
I built this company with honour.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.040
Never stole, never cheated.

13:29.040 --> 13:32.600
First sign of trouble,
you take dirty money.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.440
I'm not surprised.

13:34.440 --> 13:38.760
You always were lazy...and weak!

13:38.760 --> 13:43.640
Lazy and weak? Yes!
I gave you all this on a plate,

13:43.640 --> 13:45.360
and you ran it into the ground!

13:45.360 --> 13:47.840
I didn't run anything
into the ground, Dad!

13:47.840 --> 13:51.560
You pissed my company
down the drain! OUR company!

13:51.560 --> 13:57.040
And I didn't piss anything, OK? I'm
saving it! How, with stolen money?

13:57.040 --> 14:00.640
And what happens when the man you
took it from comes looking for it,
huh? Well, he won't.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.920
He can't, because the police
are going to catch him.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.680
They're going to put him in prison
and he's going to be out of
our hair. That's your plan?

14:06.680 --> 14:10.440
Pray the cops get him?
You're taking the easy route again.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.240
Same way you put us here. I'm not
praying anything. Dad, listen,

14:14.240 --> 14:17.480
I'll find him myself and I'll hand
him to the authorities, OK?

14:17.480 --> 14:19.320
I'll sort this! Dad!

14:21.080 --> 14:22.840
I will sort this!

14:37.960 --> 14:41.600
Mum?
I'm just going to the library, OK?

14:48.160 --> 14:50.800
Actually, Mum, that was a lie.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.800
I'm not going to go to the library,
I'm going to go...look to that boy.

14:54.800 --> 14:59.320
Oh, no, Rani. Mum, please.
Do you have feelings for this boy?

15:01.280 --> 15:03.080
I don't know, maybe.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.560
You don't think I understand
how you feel, but I do.

15:05.560 --> 15:09.520
I don't think you do. I do, I do.
Just sit, sit down one moment.

15:09.520 --> 15:14.920
I have to go. Please just
come sit down one minute. Come. Sit.

15:25.520 --> 15:30.000
When your father and I were first
married, I got a job at a company

15:30.000 --> 15:31.840
that imported clothes.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.120
I used to do sketches back then

15:34.120 --> 15:37.120
so that maybe one day
I could be a fashion designer.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.200
So I showed some of my drawings
to the man who ran the company,

15:40.200 --> 15:43.320
and he said he loved them.
He encouraged me.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.360
He said he wanted to make them.

15:45.360 --> 15:48.640
So we worked on them together
in the evenings,

15:48.640 --> 15:51.080
and he started making overtures.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.040
He said that he wanted me
to leave your father for him and...

15:58.280 --> 16:01.160
..I considered it.
You considered it?

16:01.160 --> 16:04.360
Your father was struggling.
He was working all hours.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.080
We barely saw each other.

16:06.080 --> 16:11.680
This other man, he was so handsome
and wealthy and supportive.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.800
What happened?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.320
I turned him down.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.320
Then I left the company because...

16:18.320 --> 16:21.000
..I couldn't stand
to be around him every day.

16:22.360 --> 16:26.440
So, you see, I do understand how you
feel, your attraction to this boy.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.920
But if I hadn't made the right
choice by staying with your father,

16:29.920 --> 16:33.480
by honouring my obligations,
then you wouldn't be here.

16:34.840 --> 16:38.600
Do you think about him? About...

16:38.600 --> 16:40.560
About what your life might've been?

16:40.560 --> 16:43.200
Doesn't matter what might have been.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.680
Only what is right.

16:45.680 --> 16:49.520
Rani, I had a duty
to this family back then.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.600
Just like you have a duty
to this family now.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.680
Thank you for sharing that...
with me.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.200
But...

17:05.200 --> 17:09.200
..that was your choice.
It's not mine.

17:11.120 --> 17:14.840
You are not leaving this house! Mum!
No! Please, this is important! No!

17:14.840 --> 17:17.040
THEY SHOUT

17:17.040 --> 17:20.720
What is going on here?! She's going
to be with that boy! No! What?

17:20.720 --> 17:24.600
Mum, please, this is important!
You promised us there would be no
more of this. There's no time!

17:24.600 --> 17:27.920
You have exams that you should be
studying for! Go to your room! No.

17:27.920 --> 17:30.520
Do what your father says!
Go to your room now!

17:38.400 --> 17:40.520
Fuck!

17:51.480 --> 17:56.160
How much longer do we wait? I have
a 7:00pm curfew. And I don't want
to be down here after dark. Why?

17:56.160 --> 17:58.760
The people that live round here
working class, not vampires.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.920
I'm just saying, the police
are looking for him, too.
So we need to move quick

18:01.920 --> 18:05.120
and we need to try and blend in.
Yo, homies.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.480
Great. She should blend in
perfectly.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.920
If we wind up at a bullfight.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.320
Hi, darling.

18:15.240 --> 18:18.680
Oh, yay. John came, too.
What are you doing here?

18:18.680 --> 18:22.680
Help you find the kid. Oh, so all of
a sudden you care about Christian?

18:22.680 --> 18:26.880
He's here, isn't he?
His sort don't suddenly change.

18:28.280 --> 18:29.680
My sort.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.240
Why, though?

18:33.240 --> 18:36.240
Because... Because you were right.

18:36.240 --> 18:41.120
You can't let the police
hunt him down like a rabid dog.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.200
PHONE RINGS

18:43.200 --> 18:45.040
Where are you? Everyone's here.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.560
Under house arrest.
I need your help.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.320
Hey, take a look at this.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.240
Does it seems to you that the driver
of the van and the masked man

18:59.240 --> 19:00.880
with the gun have any connection?

19:00.880 --> 19:03.040
Seems like the van's
just driving by.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.560
But assume for a moment
that there is a connection.

19:05.560 --> 19:09.840
Is it conceivable that the masked
man is gesturing to the driver?

19:09.840 --> 19:11.520
What do you mean?

19:11.520 --> 19:14.360
"Go, go, go,
get out of here, drive!"

19:16.320 --> 19:17.640
Come with me.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.160
Got it.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.640
OK. Rani has hit a snag.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.680
She's messaged Christian to tell him
to meet us here, if he can.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.520
So, Frank, you stay here
just in case he turns up.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.280
Should have brought something
to read.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.360
Here, read that.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.840
Now, everyone else follow me.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.720
Come on, chop chop.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.560
DOORBELL RINGS

20:03.600 --> 20:05.520
Yes? My name's Myrna.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.360
Would you like to end racism?

20:07.360 --> 20:09.560
How long will it take?
Shouldn't take long.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.840
In 1980, I founded the Bristol
Justice Collective,

20:12.840 --> 20:15.960
and ever since I've been fighting
for equality and respect

20:15.960 --> 20:19.560
for people of colour.
Are you willing to join me

20:19.560 --> 20:23.760
in driving a stake through
the beating heart of racism?

20:23.760 --> 20:26.360
My husband tends to deal
with things like that.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.720
Is your husband at home?

20:28.720 --> 20:31.920
There's a woman here who wants to

20:31.920 --> 20:34.720
drive a stake through
the beating heart of racism.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.520
Whatever you're selling,
we are not interested.

20:37.520 --> 20:42.560
You are not interested in ending
racism? Well, yes, obviously.

20:42.560 --> 20:46.280
Do you have children? One daughter.
They say money can't buy happiness,

20:46.280 --> 20:49.960
but what if I said a Â£30 a month
donation could buy your daughter

20:49.960 --> 20:53.960
a happier future? We don't need to
buy our daughter a happier future.

20:53.960 --> 20:57.080
You see, she's got a full
scholarship to Oxford University.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.680
We'll have a think about it.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.720
When someone says
they'll have a think about it,

21:00.720 --> 21:03.120
it usually means, A,
they're not interested or,

21:03.120 --> 21:06.280
B, they are interested,
but they're not sure.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.040
Which is it? A. Bye-bye.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.680
You want to know something funny?
Mm-hm.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.360
I think today is my birthday.

21:22.760 --> 21:25.720
Oh, Ez, I'm sorry.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.840
No, no, no, no. What are you
apologising for?

21:27.840 --> 21:32.520
All I ever wanted for my sweet 16th
was tinned sweetcorn and a smell

21:32.520 --> 21:34.000
of stagnant piss.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.680
16.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.520
I got no hold on you now.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.920
Treating you.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.800
Maybe tomorrow.

21:47.080 --> 21:52.200
You know, I'm going to give
this Airbnb a very negative review.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.640
We've stayed in worse.

21:57.040 --> 22:02.760
And I won't rent to nurses,
they'll put five in a room

22:02.760 --> 22:05.120
because they're cleaning up
after other people all day,

22:05.120 --> 22:07.680
they make no effort when they get
home, happy to live

22:07.680 --> 22:11.240
in their own shit, nurses. I mean,
don't get me wrong, they're saints.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.560
God bless the NHS.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.040
But THIS is the place.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.000
Can you feel the potential?

22:18.840 --> 22:20.800
It's a shell. With potential.

22:23.320 --> 22:26.760
Is this supposed to be a kitchen?
That'll clean up, bit of elbow
grease,

22:26.760 --> 22:28.560
don't worry about that. There's no
fridge.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.600
Yes, there is.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.440
My bad.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.480
There's no washing machine,
no cooker.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.320
You've got everything you need
across the street.

22:37.320 --> 22:43.480
Launderette, kebab shop, bookies,
vape store, hey, another kebab shop.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.800
See, this is an up and coming area.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.280
How much?

22:48.280 --> 22:49.560
585 per calendar month.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.360
My brother can't afford that if he's
going to keep me

22:52.360 --> 22:55.040
in kebabs and vapes.
585 for this place?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.560
Nah, you've got to be kidding me.

22:56.560 --> 22:59.240
You've got no references,
no savings,

22:59.240 --> 23:02.480
a bad credit score and a very low
income. Could be worse,

23:02.480 --> 23:04.360
he could be a nurse.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.400
I don't have the money. Well...

23:08.000 --> 23:09.240
..can you get it?

23:12.800 --> 23:15.520
You like these? I got them from a
guy named Barney.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.400
Only problem was - man
had four fingers.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.800
You know what I'm saying? So when he
was handing the box over,

23:20.800 --> 23:23.280
I was like... It was mad, I was
trying to not look at him,

23:23.280 --> 23:24.560
you know what I'm saying?

23:28.840 --> 23:31.840
Can we have a word? Say what you
got to say here, big bro.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.400
Look, I need some Ps.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.320
LAUGHTER

23:35.400 --> 23:37.320
He's broke!

23:37.320 --> 23:39.960
I think I offered you a job
and you said no.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.080
You think if you did that to
Lord Sugar he'd still make
you his apprentice?

23:43.080 --> 23:44.880
Yeah, well, circumstances have
changed. Not mine.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.520
Do you have a job for me or not?

23:46.520 --> 23:48.680
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

23:48.680 --> 23:50.240
You think because we went
to the same school,

23:50.240 --> 23:52.680
you don't have to show me
no fucking respect.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.200
Fuck you, pussyhole.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.040
Look, I'm sorry.

24:02.040 --> 24:05.920
All right? Spider, look, I'm
sorry for dissing you at the club.

24:05.920 --> 24:09.640
LAUGHTER

24:09.640 --> 24:10.920
You know me.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.520
You know I can be useful.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.440
I think I want to see you beg.

24:17.440 --> 24:19.520
Come on, bro. "Come on, bro," what?

24:19.520 --> 24:22.440
You gave up your shit
minute you came over here.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.000
If you want my Ps...

24:25.120 --> 24:27.920
..get on your knees and kiss
my creps.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.720
And I want to see tongue on tongue.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.240
You never hear him?

24:34.600 --> 24:37.080
Hurry up, then.
He's actually going to do it.

24:37.080 --> 24:39.880
LAUGHTER

24:48.480 --> 24:50.000
Yes.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.320
An old pipe? You shouldn't have(!)

24:52.320 --> 24:54.400
I've got a plan.
I'll come with you.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.440
Nah, nah, you can't help me with
this.

24:56.440 --> 24:59.400
You wait here. It won't be long.
Wait, wait.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.240
I'm sorry.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.200
I'll be back as soon as I can.
All right?

25:23.320 --> 25:25.160
KNOCKING ON DOOR

25:26.840 --> 25:29.840
Hi, this is going to seem
like a strange question, but do

25:29.840 --> 25:31.360
you know this person?

25:32.640 --> 25:35.680
Who's asking? We're friends
of his from community service.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.640
We thought his name was
Christian Taylor,

25:37.640 --> 25:41.920
but we saw his file and
Christian Taylor's you, isn't it?

25:41.920 --> 25:44.520
Look, OK, I know you don't know us
and we're not here to cause

25:44.520 --> 25:47.640
any trouble, but we just
really need to find...

25:47.640 --> 25:50.760
I'm not sure what to call him. Ben.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.480
Ben. OK. Is Ben a friend of yours?

25:53.480 --> 25:56.160
Yeah, he's my best friend.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.720
And he's been doing your hours for
you?

25:58.720 --> 26:00.760
You can trust us, really.

26:04.720 --> 26:08.840
My dad needs care around the clock.
Ben volunteered to do my hours

26:08.840 --> 26:10.680
for me so I could look after him.

26:10.680 --> 26:14.760
Oh, my God, that is so sweet!
Yeah, Ben's a great guy.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.320
Well, you know that.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.640
What do you want with Benny?

26:21.640 --> 26:24.920
He's in trouble, and it's my fault.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.040
We just want to help him.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.520
Do you have any idea where
we could find him?

26:29.520 --> 26:32.320
I wish.
I've been trying to find him myself.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.840
Well, here's my number.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.480
If you hear from him,
would you give me a call?

26:35.480 --> 26:37.880
We just really need to get hold of
him.

26:38.840 --> 26:41.120
Yeah, me too.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.320
OK, thank you.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.800
They say that money can't buy
happiness

26:47.800 --> 26:51.160
but did you know that for a Â£30
a month donation

26:51.160 --> 26:54.680
you could be helping to end racism?

26:54.680 --> 26:57.960
Come on. I'll just... I'll just
leave this leaflet.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.680
Christian? Ben?

27:17.120 --> 27:19.200
It's me, it's Rani.

27:21.040 --> 27:24.480
OK, start knocking on doors. Yeah.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.760
Not that one, we've done that one.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.320
So he's not there.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.680
We're going to need to split up
and ask around.

27:32.680 --> 27:33.720
OK?

27:41.920 --> 27:44.720
No, sorry. OK, thank you.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.920
No, sorry. Thanks.

27:51.680 --> 27:55.880
OK, thank you. Are you Lady Gabby?

27:55.880 --> 27:58.840
No, no, I can't say he looks
familiar at all, no.

27:58.840 --> 28:03.080
I was wondering if you've seen
this handsome young man?

28:03.080 --> 28:04.520
Rude.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.200
Sorry, sorry!

28:06.200 --> 28:08.760
Oh, cheers for that. Thank you.

28:08.760 --> 28:13.120
Yeah, I know him, he's a great lad,
he looks after his little sister.

28:13.120 --> 28:16.640
But you don't know where he is? I
haven't seen him for a few days now.
Yeah.

28:16.640 --> 28:19.440
Sorry. OK, thank you.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.160
HE EXHALES

28:45.040 --> 28:46.080
Thanks, mate.

28:50.600 --> 28:54.800
Well, where's your men's room?
Toilets for customers only.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.680
Fine, double mai tai.

28:56.680 --> 28:59.440
What the fuck's a mai tai?
Do you have a pineapple?

29:04.640 --> 29:05.880
Hello.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.640
May I join you? Get a drink first.

29:11.640 --> 29:12.840
Three mai tais.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.400
I'm looking for...

29:25.040 --> 29:27.520
Oh, yeah, he's a sweet boy,
really polite.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.000
Is he OK?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.920
He's, um... Yeah, I don't know.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.760
He lives local.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.200
And the question is whether
you've seen him or not.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.240
No, I haven't. I'm sorry. OK.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.440
There's a laptop in there!

29:53.520 --> 29:55.360
All right. Fun's over.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.720
You're acting like children.

29:57.720 --> 29:58.760
Anything?

30:00.400 --> 30:02.120
No. No.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.040
Nothing. Anything?

30:07.800 --> 30:11.080
Greg, how are you, mate?!
I don't know who you are.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.720
I've never met you before. I'm Jeff.
I work here.

30:13.720 --> 30:16.080
I've not seen you for a while.
Yeah, you've never seen me.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.920
I've never been here or anywhere...
Just be quiet.

30:18.920 --> 30:23.080
I sold you that DVD, Indiana Bones
and the Temple of Poon.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.520
No-one buys DVDs, do they?

30:24.520 --> 30:27.280
Because it's a dead technology,
so you're mistaken.

30:27.280 --> 30:30.040
Hey, wait, do you remember that porn
star name game that we played?

30:30.040 --> 30:31.520
What was Christian's?

30:31.520 --> 30:33.120
How is that relevant?

30:33.120 --> 30:36.760
Your porn name is your first pet
and the street you grew up on.

30:36.760 --> 30:39.200
Maybe someone there knows him.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.200
No, Christian didn't have a pet.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.240
Oh, wait, but his neighbour did.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.280
And it was...

30:45.800 --> 30:49.120
Fluffy...Lambs Bottom.
Fluffy Lambs Bottom.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.360
That way.

31:00.640 --> 31:04.600
# Don't cha wish your girlfriend
was raw like me?

31:04.600 --> 31:08.120
# Don't cha wish your girlfriend
was fun like me?

31:08.120 --> 31:09.600
# Don't cha?

31:12.520 --> 31:14.320
# Don't cha? #

31:24.920 --> 31:27.080
Inside now. Move, move.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.920
Remember me. I ain't got no money,
man. I don't want your money,

31:33.920 --> 31:35.320
I want information.

31:35.320 --> 31:38.160
The people who were here before,
who are they?

31:38.160 --> 31:40.080
Just, uh, just friends of mine.
You're chatting shit.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.000
They were serving up in here.
Who are they?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.280
No, man, friends of mine from
London, I've known them for ages,

31:44.280 --> 31:47.440
I swear. Do you want to lose your
life for these friends of yours?

31:47.440 --> 31:50.000
No. Who are they?

31:51.320 --> 31:54.040
I didn't get no names.
Who do they work for?

31:54.040 --> 31:57.120
I don't know.
Who the fuck do they work for?

31:59.360 --> 32:02.240
They only referred to him
as The Dean,

32:02.240 --> 32:04.200
but he don't leave London.

32:04.200 --> 32:08.480
He pays a local crew for protection.
What local crew?

32:08.480 --> 32:10.440
Have you heard of Brook Hill?

32:21.520 --> 32:22.560
Hello, sir.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.320
My name's Diane Pemberley,
I'm from Bristol Community Service.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.120

32:28.800 --> 32:32.000
Yes. Aston from JLS.
Ah, no, I see your confusion.

Hello again, Mrs Rekowski.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.080
Why didn't you tell me your daughter
was doing community payback?

32:46.080 --> 32:50.480
It is not something we are proud of.
Is Rani here?

32:50.480 --> 32:52.280
I need to speak with her.

32:53.960 --> 32:57.600
Rani? Rani, the police are here.

32:57.600 --> 33:01.120
They want to talk to you. Rani!

33:19.040 --> 33:22.200
We're not angry with you
but please can you call us?

33:22.200 --> 33:24.160
OK, sweetheart? Please call.

33:25.360 --> 33:26.400
Where is she?

33:36.520 --> 33:39.160
Mr Rekowski, it wasn't you at the
drug house robbery, was it?

33:39.160 --> 33:41.320
It was Rani.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.280
You lied to me.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.600
Yes.

33:45.920 --> 33:48.320
If you know where Rani is,
you have to tell me. We don't know.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.440
This is serious.

33:49.440 --> 33:52.240
If your daughter is involved with
this boy, she's in real danger.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.640
Well, if I knew where she was,
I would tell you.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.160
I know how we can find her.

Sorry to bother you.

My name is John.

This...this young man came to us
for help and has since gone missing.

34:52.640 --> 34:55.000
We are very concerned for his
whereabouts. Have you seen him?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.400
Yeah, I've seen him sometimes,

34:56.400 --> 34:58.400
coming and going from a house
up the street.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.680
Oh, thank Christ...Jesus Christ.

35:00.680 --> 35:03.440
Thank Jesus Christ,
our Lord and Saviour.

35:03.440 --> 35:04.480
Which number?

35:11.800 --> 35:14.880
Marky? That you?

35:14.880 --> 35:19.360
Who are you?
We're looking for Ben. You police?

35:19.360 --> 35:21.600
No, we're friends of his,
do you know him?

35:21.600 --> 35:24.280
Got to go, waiting for someone.
We're just going to ask

35:24.280 --> 35:26.000
a few questions. Please.

35:28.640 --> 35:29.680
Thank you.

35:32.080 --> 35:35.040
What do you want?
We need to find, Ben.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.160
It's really important.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.440
So if you know where he is...
Please, I'm rattling.

35:40.440 --> 35:43.000

coming, I've got to go.

Marky, they're not the police.
I swear to you, I swear.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.720
Here you go.

35:54.840 --> 35:59.560
If you have any idea where we can
find him, that would help us.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.200
I can't help you.

36:02.440 --> 36:05.000
Gimme that! Where is he?
I don't know. Give it me!

36:05.000 --> 36:06.680
Tell me where he is and you can
have this!

36:06.680 --> 36:08.800
I don't know, my son don't talk
to me!

36:10.000 --> 36:12.360
Please give it to me.
Just give it to her.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.400
Where is he? His flat, probably.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.120
Where would he go
if he couldn't go there?

36:16.120 --> 36:18.240
I don't know! Think!

36:18.240 --> 36:21.480
The burnt warehouse with the
graffiti, Cumberland Basin.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.440
Him and his sister used to run away
when they was kids.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.360
I used to find them there.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.480
Please! For God's sake.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.640
Thank you. Sorry.

36:36.080 --> 36:38.840
You're not going to hurt my boy,
are you?

36:38.840 --> 36:41.600
No. You're not going to hurt my son?
No.

36:43.520 --> 36:46.560
He looks after me, looks
after his sister.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.040
He's a good boy. Yeah, I used to...

37:09.040 --> 37:12.520
What chance do you have
when your mother is that ill, hey?

37:12.520 --> 37:14.240
No chance.

RINGTONE PLAYS STEEL DRUM MUSIC

Hello. Greg-nog,
where are you? Ploughman's arrived.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.760
Yeah, I'm running a bit late,
actually.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.280
What is this about, exactly?

37:24.280 --> 37:26.440
It's about the fact that if
you're not here in the next half

37:26.440 --> 37:28.720
hour, I'll contact the
Solicitor's Regulation Authority

37:28.720 --> 37:30.960
and you'll never practise law again.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.800
And then I'll eat your pickled
onion.

37:48.040 --> 37:51.960
Soldier, did you find the prick?
This is the prick.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.160
You got bare nerve.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.520
I've got bare nerve? You set me up.

37:55.520 --> 37:58.520
What you chatting about?
I know about The Dean.

37:58.520 --> 38:01.000
You made me steal his line
to keep yourself, knowing

38:01.000 --> 38:03.520
you could blame me for it
when he clocked.

38:03.520 --> 38:04.960
Yeah, fine, you're right.

38:04.960 --> 38:07.280
But why did you have to take
his fucking money too?

38:07.280 --> 38:08.880
Why did you double cross him?

38:08.880 --> 38:11.200
Listen, I had no choice.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.840
He's running lines all over the West

38:12.840 --> 38:15.240
that should be mine
and taxing me too!

38:15.240 --> 38:19.600
Then there was COVID,
no furlough scheme for me.

38:19.600 --> 38:23.080
And I've got to feed, clothe
and house two brothers,

38:23.080 --> 38:24.920
one sister and a mum who can't work

38:24.920 --> 38:27.680
because she's got to take full time
care of my dad.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.440
I don't earn, they don't eat.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.800
Just return the fucking money,
brother.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.600
But the money's gone.
Get it back then!

38:37.600 --> 38:39.400
I can't get it back.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.360
Then I've got to hand you
to The Dean, bruv.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.760
No, no, no, no.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.560
Look, just let me and Ez leave
Bristol.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.720
All right? Once we go
we're out of your hair.

38:46.720 --> 38:49.280
All right? You won't have to see
us again. Not going to happen, bruv.

38:49.280 --> 38:53.480
The Dean wants a body and it ain't
going to be mine,

38:53.480 --> 38:56.800
so you can run all you like
but I will find you.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.800
Hey. No, no, no, it's OK.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.600
You OK?

39:37.600 --> 39:39.840
What are you doing here?

39:39.840 --> 39:41.800
We came to help.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.080
I was just coming. Feds? No.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.600
Why are you here?
Because I'm your friend.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.440
Friends don't snitch on each other.

39:54.440 --> 39:57.600
You had a gun. I was scared.
I'm...I'm sorry.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.960
I didn't know what to do.

39:58.960 --> 40:02.320
You could have trusted me!
What, like, you trusted me...Ben?

40:05.800 --> 40:08.880
No, you didn't come here to help.
Then, why am I here?

40:08.880 --> 40:12.320
The same reason you're a shoplifter,
to piss off Mum and Dad,

40:12.320 --> 40:14.880
to feel alive, whatever
meaning of life bullshit

40:14.880 --> 40:16.480
you're in the middle of.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.360
Look around, Rani.

40:18.360 --> 40:22.080
Some of us don't have to fuck
things up on purpose.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.240
Life fucks things up just fine
on its own.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.360
Go home.

40:32.440 --> 40:35.680
You don't have to trust me,
but there are four strangers

40:35.680 --> 40:39.160
in there with nothing to gain
who came here to help you.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.200
So why don't you let them?

40:47.160 --> 40:50.160
I've lost her.
What do you mean you've lost her?

40:50.160 --> 40:53.400
She might have gone into a building
or underground. Underg...?

40:53.400 --> 40:55.440
What, did she fall down a hole?!

41:13.800 --> 41:16.000
The only real evidence against you
is Rani saying

41:16.000 --> 41:18.240
that she witnessed you hiding
the firearm.

41:18.240 --> 41:20.720
Now, I would never advocate perjury,
but if she proved

41:20.720 --> 41:24.400
to be an unreliable witness, that
would help your case enormously.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.360
And it's not like the gun was fired.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.280
What?

41:31.280 --> 41:33.160
The gun was fired.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.560
I shot someone. Oh, my God.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.120
It was self-defence.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.640
Is the person...? I don't know.

41:40.640 --> 41:43.280
OK, you have to hand yourself in,
running makes you look guilty.

41:43.280 --> 41:46.400
If you wait for the police to catch
up with you it will weaken your case

41:46.400 --> 41:48.560
and they will catch up with you.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.960
We won't abandon you, I promise.

41:50.960 --> 41:53.280
Look, if you need help with money,
I can always get you a lawyer

41:53.280 --> 41:55.160
like Greg. Or a competent one.

41:55.160 --> 41:57.720
You'll have the support of my group.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.600
I barely trust you lot,

41:59.600 --> 42:02.360
you think I'm going to trust
police or lawyers?

42:02.360 --> 42:04.640
Look, I appreciate you guys
coming back.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.560
I think I'm going to take
my chances.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.480
Son, I understand what you're
saying.

42:08.480 --> 42:09.840
I remember the 1970s.

42:09.840 --> 42:12.520
The police were always roughing up
black people, thinking

42:12.520 --> 42:15.680
they could arrest us any which way
they wanted.

42:15.680 --> 42:18.600
One day, me and my mates found
this young black boy lying

42:18.600 --> 42:20.880
in the road, covered in blood.

42:20.880 --> 42:23.200
He said the police
had beaten him up.

42:23.200 --> 42:27.200
So we carried him to the police
station, told them what happened,

42:27.200 --> 42:29.080
and they told us to fuck off.

42:30.360 --> 42:36.520
Called us black bitches, niggers,
coons, disgusting language.

42:37.920 --> 42:43.320
I was young, white hot with rage,
so I went and bought some petrol.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.480
Stole some empty milk bottles,
ripped up a silk scarf my mum

42:46.480 --> 42:49.200
had given me to use as a wick,

42:49.200 --> 42:53.520
and I went back to that police
station at night when it was empty,

42:53.520 --> 42:56.840
and I lit those petrol bombs
and I sent them in front and back

42:56.840 --> 42:59.480
and burned that place to the ground.

43:00.600 --> 43:05.320
I felt like a hero, like some sort
of warrior fighting for justice.

43:07.600 --> 43:12.160
The next day, in the paper, said
the police station wasn't empty.

43:14.440 --> 43:20.640
PC Colin Denison, 28 years old,
died in that fire.

43:24.840 --> 43:28.560
Why are you telling me this?
Because take it from me,

43:28.560 --> 43:32.400
if you don't face up to the
consequences of your actions,

43:32.400 --> 43:35.040
the guilt won't go away.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.800
34 years' time, it'll still be
there,

43:37.800 --> 43:40.120
growing inside you like a tumour.

43:58.400 --> 44:01.760
Ha! Argh! Oh! Sorry, you all right?

44:01.760 --> 44:05.400
Oh, oh, that's probably going
to be a black eye.

44:05.400 --> 44:08.480
Ah, and I've got a date tomorrow.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.960
You've got a date?!

44:09.960 --> 44:11.440
Yeah, why is that shocking?

44:11.440 --> 44:13.200
You! You are in big trouble.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.480
Who's this? Don't matter.
It does matter!

44:15.480 --> 44:18.080
I'm your worst nightmare!
Hello, sweetie, you all right?

44:18.080 --> 44:20.880
I'm Diane. Nice to meet you.
How did you meet this date?

44:20.880 --> 44:24.680
My mum fixed us up, and he's
an absolute stud, apparently.

44:24.680 --> 44:28.320
How did you know where to find us?
Doesn't matter.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.960
It was you, wasn't it?

44:30.960 --> 44:33.120
It was fucking you!

44:33.120 --> 44:35.320
Look, you're in major trouble
,matey, all of you are

44:35.320 --> 44:38.360
for aiding and abetting. And you
have royally screwed yourself,
missy!

44:38.360 --> 44:41.680
Shh! Shh! Don't tell me to shush!
Shut up, man.

44:41.680 --> 44:44.040
SHE SCOFFS

44:41.680 --> 44:44.040
Can you believe him?

44:44.040 --> 44:48.440
I am your superior, actually!
Everyone, get to the minibus now.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.640
No, you don't get to give the
orders, I give the orders

44:50.640 --> 44:53.240
if anyone is giving orders...
Go! Run! OK, all right.

44:53.240 --> 44:56.520
You heard him. Go, everyone! That is
an order from me!

45:12.200 --> 45:13.280
That way.

45:16.280 --> 45:18.000
SHE SCREAMS

45:22.000 --> 45:23.200
I've got you!

45:25.040 --> 45:26.520
Drive! Drive!

45:30.280 --> 45:31.720
Go faster!

45:44.480 --> 45:45.760
Thank you.

45:50.880 --> 45:53.840
Her signal's back, but she is moving
very fast.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.520
What is going on?! I don't know.

47:37.480 --> 47:38.680
Fuck!

48:08.120 --> 48:10.520
Oh, are you OK?

48:14.920 --> 48:18.440
Are you all right? Listen,
it's best if you come quietly,

48:18.440 --> 48:19.960
I know you shot someone.

48:19.960 --> 48:22.360
No, he didn't. I did. Ez!

48:24.720 --> 48:28.080
Look, she's lying. No, I'm not.
Take me to the police.

48:28.080 --> 48:31.120
Diane, look, ignore her. OK?
She's just a kid.

48:31.120 --> 48:32.960
Don't let him take the blame
for something I did.

48:32.960 --> 48:36.320
Look, listen to me, I have nothing
to lose. You do.

48:36.320 --> 48:40.200
This is my fault. You're smart.
Ask Rani.

48:40.200 --> 48:42.360
You've got a bright future.

48:42.360 --> 48:44.480
I won't let you ruin that.

48:44.480 --> 48:47.560
Look, they already think it's me.

48:47.560 --> 48:51.120
I can't do this to you. It's going
to be OK, I promise you.

48:56.880 --> 49:00.520
SINGING: Don't cha wish your
girlfriend was hot like me?

49:00.520 --> 49:03.480
Here you are!
What happened to you guys?

49:03.480 --> 49:06.160
I was worried... All right,
everyone, facedown on the ground!

49:06.160 --> 49:08.960
OK? I said get on the fucking
ground!

49:08.960 --> 49:13.200
All right. All right. Facedown!
No-one look at me or I'll cut you!

49:26.000 --> 49:31.040
That's my phone. Shall I answer it?
No.

49:31.040 --> 49:33.680
Just it's this bloke from work
and he'll kill me if I don't.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.880
Yeah? What do you think I'll do?

49:38.200 --> 49:39.600
I'll let it go to voicemail.

50:00.680 --> 50:01.800
You two, up.

50:12.040 --> 50:13.400
London don't need Ez.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.360
It's going to be OK, all right?

50:21.800 --> 50:23.120
Come on, then.

50:37.840 --> 50:40.760
Move! Son...

50:40.760 --> 50:42.800
..I don't know what circumstances
in your life

50:42.800 --> 50:44.160
have led to this moment,

50:44.160 --> 50:47.200
but no-one here has any right
to judge you.

50:47.200 --> 50:51.080
We're all here because we made
a lot of bad decisions.

50:51.080 --> 50:56.160
But I am telling you right
now that the only way this ends...

50:56.160 --> 51:01.640
..is with him staying and you
walking out that door.

51:01.640 --> 51:02.880
Move!

straight for the police.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.960
Hey, it's OK.

52:59.520 --> 53:00.640
It's OK.

53:02.200 --> 53:05.480
While carrying out my duties
as a community payback supervisor,

53:05.480 --> 53:08.520
I found a CZ 75
semi-automatic pistol.

53:08.520 --> 53:12.200
Someone who looked like this
Christian or Ben, whatever his name

53:12.200 --> 53:14.760
is, stuck a gun in my face.

53:14.760 --> 53:16.800
You told me you'd never
seen Benjamin Eastfield

53:16.800 --> 53:18.440
outside of community service.

53:18.440 --> 53:21.000
Would you like to change
that statement?

53:21.000 --> 53:23.640
No. What about now?

53:25.400 --> 53:29.360
I saw them together at this boat
party and they were laughing,

53:29.360 --> 53:32.360
dancing, flirting, it was
very intimate.

53:32.360 --> 53:36.000
When pressed, Rani Rekowski
told me she saw the pistol

53:36.000 --> 53:38.920
being handled by Christian Taylor,

53:38.920 --> 53:41.280
real name, Ben something.

53:41.280 --> 53:42.440
I made that up.

53:42.440 --> 53:45.080
Why would you do that? To get
back at him.

53:45.080 --> 53:46.200
Get back at him why?

53:46.200 --> 53:50.720
She told me that she told Christian,
Ben, that she has feelings

53:50.720 --> 53:53.880
for him, but he didn't have the same
feelings for her.

53:53.880 --> 53:57.680
I mean, and if I'm honest, I think
he has a bit of a thing for me.

53:57.680 --> 54:01.760
So you lied to Diane about seeing
him with the gun as revenge?

54:01.760 --> 54:04.760
I was really jealous and upset.

54:04.760 --> 54:08.880
Women are so emotional.
Well, you know that.

54:08.880 --> 54:11.240
Is the man, who was shot, dead?

54:11.240 --> 54:13.760
No, he's awake and doing OK.

54:13.760 --> 54:16.240
Did he identify the shooter?
Won't tell us anything.

54:16.240 --> 54:21.080
That's because snitches get
stitches. You might want to write
that down.

54:22.960 --> 54:26.880
Was this the man that threatened you
with the gun?

54:26.880 --> 54:30.400
Listen, all I know is black kids
are nine times more likely

54:30.400 --> 54:33.400
to be stopped by the police
than white kids.

54:33.400 --> 54:34.760
So what does that tell you?

54:34.760 --> 54:39.000
Did you know that John is being sued
for aggravated racial assault?

54:39.000 --> 54:40.760
I mean, the man's a monster!

54:40.760 --> 54:44.240
You have no fingerprints on the gun,
and your only witnesses are a jilted

54:44.240 --> 54:46.960
lover and a confirmed racist.

54:46.960 --> 54:49.680
Are you really going to charge
my client?

54:49.680 --> 54:52.160
If the gun wasn't yours,
then why run?

54:52.160 --> 54:53.560
Why not go to the police?

54:55.080 --> 54:57.400
Do you want to answer
that or should I?

54:57.400 --> 55:00.240
We've been out looking
for the impostor Christian,

55:00.240 --> 55:02.680
whose real name is Ben
but we didn't know his name

55:02.680 --> 55:04.400
was Ben until we found Christian.

55:04.400 --> 55:07.440
Christian said he was friends
with Ben, the person

55:07.440 --> 55:08.640
we thought was Christian.

55:08.640 --> 55:12.040
But Christian was an impostor too,
pretending to be friends

55:12.040 --> 55:17.280
with Christian, meaning
Ben, to use us to find Ben,

55:17.280 --> 55:19.960
who we thought was Christian.

55:19.960 --> 55:21.440
Is that helpful?

55:22.720 --> 55:25.000
Get out. Thank you.

55:26.040 --> 55:29.640
Diane, as one member of law
enforcement to another,

55:29.640 --> 55:32.480
how do I prove this man
fired this gun?

55:35.080 --> 55:39.000
Ma'am, as I see it,
you can't prove a thing.

55:40.440 --> 55:42.120
You want to be a police officer.

55:42.120 --> 55:45.600
If you were in my shoes, would you
just let him walk away scot free?

55:45.600 --> 55:47.440
No, ma'am.
I'd want to see him punished.

55:47.440 --> 55:49.080
How would you do that?

55:52.880 --> 55:55.120
100 hours of community payback.

56:03.480 --> 56:06.680
# Don't you know that's the sound
of the men?

56:06.680 --> 56:11.760
# They're working on the chain gang

56:11.760 --> 56:15.360
# Oh ah, the sound of the men

56:15.360 --> 56:19.160
# They're working on the chain gang

56:19.160 --> 56:21.640
# All day long they're singing

56:21.640 --> 56:27.800
# Mm hoh uh ah

56:29.320 --> 56:33.520
# Mm ah... #

56:33.520 --> 56:36.400
I think we're going to need
a bit more cooperation...

56:36.400 --> 56:38.600
# Don't you know the sound
of the men?

56:38.600 --> 56:44.520
# They're working on the chain gang

56:44.520 --> 56:48.280
# Can't you hear them working?

56:48.280 --> 56:52.280
# They're working on the chain gang

56:54.080 --> 56:56.680
# All day long they work so hard

56:56.680 --> 56:59.840
# Till the sun is going down... #

56:59.840 --> 57:02.320
Diane, look at this rat I found.

57:02.320 --> 57:06.280
Any vermin under ten kilos
are yours, bag it and bin it.

57:06.280 --> 57:07.880
No, it's a graffiti rat.

57:07.880 --> 57:11.400
Council said paint over
any graffiti so crack on.

57:12.680 --> 57:14.640
It's awfully good.

57:14.640 --> 57:17.000
Less debating, more painting.

57:18.800 --> 57:21.040
# That's the sound of the men

57:21.040 --> 57:25.960
# They're working on the chain gang

57:25.960 --> 57:29.240
# Oh, lord, that's the sound
of the men... #

57:31.200 --> 57:33.400
I knew who it was from page one.

57:33.400 --> 57:34.840
Nothing gets past me.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.280
# The sound of the men

57:54.280 --> 57:58.920
# Working on the chain gang

57:58.920 --> 58:02.440
# Everyday that's the sound of them

58:02.440 --> 58:06.480
# They're working on the chain gang

58:06.480 --> 58:08.600
This is what they're saying!

58:08.600 --> 58:11.440
# I'm going home one of these days

58:11.440 --> 58:14.360
# I'm going home
Yes, I am

58:14.360 --> 58:16.000
# See my woman... #
