WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
What's happening, cornflake head?

00:02.960 --> 00:04.960
'Ey, we need to be mates again,
you know.

00:04.960 --> 00:07.160
I've had to turn to drugs
to cope without ya.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.000
Not funny.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.160
I can't believe
you got me up early for this.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.960
Oh, just a little bit dirty.
Oh, just...

00:19.960 --> 00:21.480
Just a little bit more there.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.320
Argh!
Keep pushing.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.960
I can't.
Go on, one more.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.960
One more, come on push.

00:36.960 --> 00:41.960
Look, look at him. He's a baby boy.

00:41.960 --> 00:42.960
Congratulations.

00:45.960 --> 00:50.800
You cheatin' prick.
A son. A son! Congratulations.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.960
HE LAUGHS

00:56.960 --> 00:58.960
Fancy some FIFA after school later?

00:58.960 --> 01:01.960
I just need to hide a few things
first so you can't steal them.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.960
Lad, I already explained
what happened. I'm joking.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.960
Can you bring one of
your controllers, too, though?

01:06.960 --> 01:09.640
I've lost one of mine.
That's cos I stole it from ya room.

01:09.640 --> 01:10.960
THEY LAUGH

01:18.960 --> 01:20.960
HE SPEAKS ARABIC

01:24.160 --> 01:25.960
Didn't you pay for his lunches
last week?

01:25.960 --> 01:27.960
Oh, he's still having problems

01:27.960 --> 01:28.960
getting the right ID
for a bank account.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.960
I don't wanna scare you, girl,

01:30.960 --> 01:33.960
but you read about things like this
all the time.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.640
Foreign men scamming women
for money.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.960
What are you on about, girl?

01:37.960 --> 01:41.160
Like me nan, who met that Adama
fella from Gambia on Facebook.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.960
He moved here, they got married,

01:43.960 --> 01:46.960
and then he divorced her so he could
take half of her life savings.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.960
I mean, no offence to ya nan, girl,
but she was like 74, and he was 25.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.000
It was pretty obvious
he wasn't with her

01:53.000 --> 01:54.960
for her saggy tits and pancake arse.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.960
May she rest in peace.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.960
Are you sure you can trust him?

01:58.960 --> 02:00.800
He lied to you
about speaking English.

02:00.800 --> 02:01.960
Oh, my God, girl, are you jealous?

02:01.960 --> 02:03.160
No, you were the one saying

02:03.160 --> 02:05.800
it's weird
you haven't been to his house yet.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.960
Yeah, well, yesterday,
he had me waiting on the corner,

02:07.960 --> 02:10.960
and I could definitely just about
work out which house was his.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.320
So there.
Why was he making you

02:12.320 --> 02:13.800
wait on the corner?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.960
Well, you're one to talk,
chasin' after that posh bellend.

02:15.960 --> 02:19.960
As if. I mean, it's getting
a bit embarrasin', to be honest.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.960
He's not interested
in girls like you,

02:22.960 --> 02:23.960
but he doesn't wanna tell you

02:23.960 --> 02:25.960
because he doesn't wanna look
like a snob.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.640
Go away, you divvy.
Oh, don't worry girl. I'm going.

02:29.640 --> 02:32.640
You see, I've actually got
a meetin' with Netflix.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.960
Yeah, they wanna do a documentary
on Ziad, The Libyan Swindler,

02:35.960 --> 02:39.960
about how he manipulated a stupid,
naive girl from Liverpool...

02:39.960 --> 02:41.320
for a fiver.

02:53.960 --> 02:57.000
Oh, Nice 'n' Spicy
just edge it for me.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.960
Aww, lad, if you're a Rib 'n' Saucy
type of guy, it's OK.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.960
They're both
two absolute heavyweights.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.960
My mum's just emailed me.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.960
Oh, no. Have you lost the plot

03:08.960 --> 03:11.960
cos I haven't been around
to keep you sane?

03:11.960 --> 03:14.000
Before she died, she must have
scheduled emails for me.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.320
What does it say?

03:16.320 --> 03:21.160
"Hiya, son. Cancer must have got me
by now. Or did it?

03:21.160 --> 03:22.960
"Maybe I faked my death

03:22.960 --> 03:26.960
"and now live off-the-grid
in Alaska with an impressive beard."

03:26.960 --> 03:29.960
She had a weird sense of humour.
I love it, lad.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.960
"I know your dad's birthday
was always a tough day for us.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.960
"So I wanna remind you
of the poem we wrote for him.

03:39.960 --> 03:44.960
"The image is fading
of what it was like...

03:44.960 --> 03:47.960
"when you would hold me
incredibly tight.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.800
"But I'll give never forget
the feeling you gave...

03:54.960 --> 03:57.960
"..the feeling that
everything was all right."

04:04.960 --> 04:07.960
"I'll keep going
like you're by my side.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.960
"So, when I see you again,
and you ask me how it went,

04:10.960 --> 04:14.480
"I'll tell you it was fun,
and I achieved everything I dreamt.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.960
"Love you, my son.
Hope those words are coming true."

04:24.960 --> 04:26.160
Thanks for taking over.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.960
But did you have to do it
with a mouth full of Nik Naks?

04:29.960 --> 04:31.960
THEY LAUGH

04:34.320 --> 04:37.960
Do you know where your dad lives?
I dunno, I've never met him.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.480
Do you wanna meet him?

04:41.480 --> 04:45.960
No, I'm not arsed.
I did as a kid, though.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.960
You can still make some memories
with your dad.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.160
I'd do anything to make some more
with mine...

04:53.160 --> 04:56.800
even for one day, one hour,
one minute.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.960
I wonder what your da's favourite
Nik Naks were.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.960
I have a fading memory
of him eating Rib 'n' Saucy.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.960
THEY LAUGH

05:08.960 --> 05:10.960
Come 'ead, lad.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.960
Where the fuck's all this coming
from, Reece?

05:15.960 --> 05:19.160
Do you think I've done a bad job?
No, Mum, you've been amazing.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.960
It's just
I was speaking to Christopher,

05:20.960 --> 05:23.960
and he wrote this poem to his dad,
before he died,

05:23.960 --> 05:25.960
and... just gets ya thinking,
doesn't it?

05:25.960 --> 05:30.160
So what? We can write a poem
to your dad if you want.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.960
Er... 'I know this poem's come
out of the blue,

05:33.960 --> 05:36.960
'but we've never needed ya,
so fuck you.'

05:36.960 --> 05:39.640
See? Easy.
Beautiful, Mum.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.960
Ever since you were born, all
I've done is try and make you happy.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.960
And now I feel like you're tellin'
me I haven't done enough.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.320
No, Mum, that's not true at all.
You have been enough.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.960
I am happy. I am.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.960
Sorry, Mum.
I didn't mean to upset ya.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.160
Are you sure you're ready for this,
Reece?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.960
Yeah, Mum.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.960
Suppose I've always just pushed it
away.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.960
But it's always been
in the back of me head.

06:08.960 --> 06:13.800
Like, "Who is this fella
who's 50% of who I am?" OK.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.000
Well, I'm not ready.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.640
But if you are,
then I suppose I need to be.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.960
Your dad's name's Darren.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.960
Disneyland Darren.
Wha'?

06:29.960 --> 06:33.960
I know. Look, his mate said it was
cos he was always goin' on about

06:33.960 --> 06:35.960
this trip he took to Disneyland.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.960
Even when we were having sex,
he kept going on about

06:37.960 --> 06:40.800
how it reminded him
of going down Splash Mountain.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.960
Mum!
I know. I know.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.960
It was a one night stand, son.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.960
After I found out I was pregnant,
I tried to find him.

06:49.960 --> 06:53.480
I swear, I did,
but... he's not from round here.

06:54.960 --> 06:58.960
He's from Manchester.
I'm sorry! I know!

06:58.960 --> 07:03.480
I know!
Oh, I tried me best to find him.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.960
So, he doesn't know about me?
No, son.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.960
Once I realised
I couldn't find him,

07:08.960 --> 07:12.000
I knew I had to just focus on you.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.960
And the day you were born...
I promised ya...

07:18.960 --> 07:21.960
that I'd be
twice the mum that you deserved,

07:21.960 --> 07:23.960
to make up for the fact
that ye never had your dad.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.960
And ye have been, Mum.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.960
Come here. Come on.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.960
I love you.
I love you, too.

07:39.960 --> 07:44.960
Ooh, I love you so much.
Me little gobshite.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.960
Hiya, what are you up to?

07:51.960 --> 07:53.960
Oh, I'm working
on a history project with Ruby.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.960
Hey, did you hear about me dad's
acca comin' in at the weekend?

07:56.960 --> 08:00.480
He won 2,000 quid.
It's crazy, eh?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.960
Why'd you pick Ruby to be
your partner?

08:01.960 --> 08:03.960
She sits by me in the class.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.960
Oh, my God. Has he asked you
to marry him? You wha'?

08:08.960 --> 08:11.640
You haven't given him
your bank details, have ye?

08:11.640 --> 08:13.800
Oh, I'm sure
she'll use the winnings to buy you

08:13.800 --> 08:14.960
lunches and the PS5 you want.

08:14.960 --> 08:19.960
Oh, and your dad defo could have won
more. He cashed out, the pussy.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.960
He choked.
PSG were obvs gonna score.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.320
He's all yours!
Come on, Mia.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.960
Nice one for findin' him, lad,
the Disneyland discussion forums.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.960
You're a genius. This is it?

08:32.960 --> 08:34.960
Well, let's not judge him
on where he lives.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.960
He could still be
a really respectable guy.

08:41.960 --> 08:42.960
Which one of you is Reece?

08:58.960 --> 09:00.960
HE SOBS UNCONTROLLABLY

09:06.960 --> 09:09.960
You're home.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.960
Hey, do you know what's strange, son?

09:14.960 --> 09:18.960
I've been havin' a lot of thoughts
about your mum recently.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.800
So, it's like a higher power's
trying to tell me summat.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.000
A lot of those thoughts
was reaching into the wank bank.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.960
But still...
I know it don't look like much, son.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.960
But I've not been able to work
because of me disability.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.960
I have a severely stubbed toe,

09:32.960 --> 09:36.960
and the pain... radiates
through me legs.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.960
But don't worry because I've got
big, big money coming my way.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.960
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.960
I'm always applying
to Pointless, Millionaire.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.960
It's only a matter of time
before I win big.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.960
I made it onto The Chase once, son.
Really? How'd ye do?

09:52.960 --> 09:55.160
Well, I took the lower offer,
and I still got knocked out,

09:55.160 --> 09:56.960
but I was very unlucky
with the questions.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.960
Currently doing another application
for Pointless now, as we speak.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.960
Oh, my God!

10:01.960 --> 10:04.320
We should do one together
as a father-and-son team!

10:04.320 --> 10:05.960
I'm all right, to be honest.

10:08.960 --> 10:13.640
Fuckin' hell,
me own son fuckin' hates me.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.960
Hey, he doesn't hate you.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.960
He just needs a bit of time
to get to know you.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.960
Oh, yeah... time.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.960
And time's what we have got, son.
Nothing but time.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.960
And I'm gonna spend every single day

10:29.960 --> 10:31.960
making up for the time
that we've lost.

10:31.960 --> 10:36.000
Every... single... day.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.960
Just you... and me... together.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.800
I'm gonna get off.
It-It was nice to meet you.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.960
Oh, really? Hey,
do you wanna go go-karting tomorrow?

10:47.960 --> 10:50.960
I can take you swimming.
Wait, that's it? You're going?

10:50.960 --> 10:53.320
See the state of him?
16 years for him?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.960
I'd rather not know where
I came from, if I came from that.

10:55.960 --> 10:56.960
I need the toilet before we go.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.960
Oh, hurry up, before he asks me
to play catch or something.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.960
Hey, son,
do you know how to ride a bike?

11:02.960 --> 11:03.960
Because I could teach you.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.000
I'll wait outside, lad.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.960
THEY LAUGH
Hey.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.960
Do you wanna come to me mum's
birthday meal tomorrow night?

11:19.960 --> 11:20.960
She really wants to meet you,

11:20.960 --> 11:22.960
and we've got
an extra seat at the table

11:22.960 --> 11:25.960
as a certain SOMEONE isn't invited.
Er... s-sure.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.960
Last night, I was looking online,

11:27.960 --> 11:30.960
and I found a local support group
for family members of MS sufferers.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.960
There's one tomorrow night, actually.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.960
What an incredibly thoughtful
gesture, Christopher.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.960
It's great that me mental well-being
is clearly your top priority.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.960
Great, so you meet my parents,

11:40.960 --> 11:42.960
and then after,
I'll go your house and meet yours.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.960
It'll be great.
Erm, sure.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.960
Friday night at Ziad's house.
No waiting on the corner.

11:48.960 --> 11:49.960
I know it sounds daunting,

11:49.960 --> 11:51.960
but I could come with you,
if that's OK?

11:51.960 --> 11:55.960
Thanks, Christopher. I'd love to go
there tomorrow... together.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.960
So, actually, er, Mia-Louise,
I finally opened the bank account.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.960
So I have the money
that I owe you for the lunches.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.160
Ziad, you don't have to give me
the money back,

12:05.160 --> 12:07.960
but what a wonderful sign of trust
that you have done.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.960
Reece,
Disneyland Darren's not your dad.

13:31.960 --> 13:32.960
If only, lad.

13:32.960 --> 13:33.960
No, when we were there,

13:33.960 --> 13:35.960
I went to bathroom
so I could get a hair sample.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.480
I ordered a DNA test,
and I just got the results.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.960
He's not your dad.
You're serious? He's not me dad?

13:42.960 --> 13:45.960
You did that for me, lad? Nice one.
But, erm...

13:46.960 --> 13:48.640
...how did you get
me hair sample, though?

13:48.640 --> 13:49.960
My bin still had your pubes in it

13:49.960 --> 13:52.960
from when you thought it was funny
to keep leaving them on my pillow.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.960
THEY LAUGH

13:56.960 --> 13:57.960
I can't believe it, son.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.320
I was convinced
he was your dad cos...

14:01.320 --> 14:02.480
Cos what, mum?

14:02.480 --> 14:04.960
Cos...
when I slept with someone else

14:04.960 --> 14:06.640
the next weekend,
we used protection.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.480
Oh, my God.
Don't look at me like that!

14:08.480 --> 14:10.320
Me nan had just died.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.800
I was bladdered for three months,
out looking for distractions.

14:13.800 --> 14:18.960
Which is why I admire you so much,
just processing all the emotions.

14:18.960 --> 14:19.960
So, who is he, then?

14:19.960 --> 14:22.960
And please don't say
Universal Studios Steve.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.480
I didn't get his real name.

14:25.480 --> 14:29.960
He went by Mr 997.
I met him in the Farmer's Arms.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.960
Afterwards, I moved away.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.960
I didn't get his phone number,
and... I never saw him again.

14:36.960 --> 14:37.960
I'm sorry, son.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.640
Fucking hell... Fucking hell.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.960
Even DNA fucking hates me.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.960
I'm absolutely devastated, son.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.960
Brought this with me
so we could build it today.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.960
Never gonna get the chance now,
am I?

14:55.960 --> 14:58.960
You know, I bet
your dad's that bean head fella,

14:58.960 --> 14:59.960
the lucky bastard.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.960
What fella?
Mr 997? Well...

15:03.960 --> 15:05.960
...the next weekend,
I went back to your mum's house

15:05.960 --> 15:07.000
with some flowers cos...

15:08.160 --> 15:09.960
...I was smitten, lads.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.160
Anyway, I rang the doorbell,
and there was no answer.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.960
So then I look through the window,
and that's when I see

15:15.960 --> 15:17.960
this hook-nosed fella
with a massive bean head,

15:17.960 --> 15:19.960

It was gutting!
You know, I saw him years later.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.800
I was in Liverpool,
and I saw his face on a poster.

15:25.640 --> 15:26.960
He was giving a talk
on one of his books.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.160
I tell you what, lads,
you never forget a cum face.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.480
He's a writer? Do you remember
the name of the book?

15:32.480 --> 15:34.480
Nah, I was smashed off my tits.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.960
But I think it was something weird

15:36.960 --> 15:39.960
about looking
through doors or windows

15:39.960 --> 15:40.960

Camilla's arguments to why
water-heavy agricultural systems

Scoring 1,000 on them
is like scoring 600 in my day.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.960
The game's gone, lad.
Do you remember a Jodie?

23:06.960 --> 23:09.320

17 years ago?

23:51.320 --> 23:54.960
'Ey, got a proper schnozz on you
there, lad. That's not from me.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.000
But if you've got a big dick,
that is.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.960
Know what I mean?

23:58.960 --> 24:02.960
