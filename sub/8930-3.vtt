[both grunt]

19:07.290 --> 19:10.189
- [laughs] SENTINEL IS OURS!

19:10.290 --> 19:12.990
THE ROYALTY WILL BE PLEASED!

19:16.324 --> 19:19.891
- OH, MAN! WE ALMOST HAD IT.

19:26.792 --> 19:30.793
MAN, IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS FISH-FACED CRAB COOK,

19:30.893 --> 19:33.060
WE'D HAVE SENTINEL RIGHT NOW.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.060
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. - OH YEAH?

19:35.160 --> 19:37.961
WHEN BOLT ASKED YOU FOR HELP, YOU TURNED HIM DOWN.

19:38.061 --> 19:40.762
WAS THAT AN ACCIDENT TOO?

19:40.862 --> 19:43.296
- IS THAT TRUE? - I WAS KINDA BUSY WITH RAMPAGE.

19:43.396 --> 19:46.396
- IF YOU WEREN'T DAMAGED, I'D SCRAMBLE YOUR CIRCUITS.

19:46.496 --> 19:48.496
- DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU, PRIMAL.

19:48.596 --> 19:50.363
- HEY, LET ME TAKE HIM, OPTIMUS!

19:50.463 --> 19:51.797
[whimpers and struggles]

19:51.896 --> 19:55.264
- I KNEW SAVING YOUR HIDE WAS A MISTAKE.

19:55.364 --> 19:56.331
- RATTRAP?

19:56.431 --> 19:58.164
- [whimpers die down]

19:58.264 --> 20:03.532
OH, WELL, YEAH, TECHNICALLY, HE DID KINDA DO THAT.

20:03.632 --> 20:07.566
UM, THANKS.

20:07.666 --> 20:10.300
- LOOKS LIKE YOU DID GIVE US SOME HELP AFTER ALL.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.533
- DON'T GO GETTIN' ALL GUSHY ON ME.

20:12.633 --> 20:16.467
- I'M NOT! YOU ALSO COST US A MAJOR STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE.

20:16.568 --> 20:19.701
THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO ACT AS AN INDEPENDENT.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.168
WE NEED YOU, MAXIMAL.

20:25.535 --> 20:27.069
- I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

20:27.169 --> 20:29.670
THIS CREW SURE NEEDS SOMETHING.

20:29.770 --> 20:33.204
- [muttering] WHY...

20:49.539 --> 20:53.540
- [evil chuckle] SENTINEL, ONLINE!

20:58.274 --> 21:03.309
[evil laugh]
