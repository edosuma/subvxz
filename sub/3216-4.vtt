00:05.005 --> 00:06.424
Take your brother outside, fast!

00:06.632 --> 00:08.008
Now, Dean. Go!

00:09.677 --> 00:10.761
Mary, no!

00:13.055 --> 00:14.849
Dad's on a hunting trip...

00:15.057 --> 00:17.017
...and he hasn't been home
in a few days.

00:19.061 --> 00:22.606
-I swore I was done hunting.
-I can't do this alone.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.568
No!

00:27.611 --> 00:28.821
We got work to do.

00:29.613 --> 00:32.241
This is Dad's single
most valuable possession.

00:32.324 --> 00:34.577
Everything he knows
about evil is in here.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.079
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:37.163 --> 00:39.707
Saving people, hunting things.
The family business.

00:39.790 --> 00:43.169
No, I gotta find Jessica's killer.
It's the only thing I can think about.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.464
Sam, you know we're gonna
find Dad, right?

00:46.672 --> 00:48.424
Yeah, I know.

Nervous flier?

01:31.675 --> 01:33.636
It's that obvious, huh?

01:33.844 --> 01:36.263
You know, what are the odds
of dying in a plane crash?

01:36.472 --> 01:39.642
I mean, what, 20,000-1?

01:42.269 --> 01:46.649
Wow. That's really reassuring.
Thank you.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.299
Thanks.

02:12.508 --> 02:16.595
-Amanda, how are you today?
-I'm doing just fine, Chuck.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.556
-Welcome aboard.
-Oh, hi.

02:18.764 --> 02:22.768

of the plane on the right.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.772
Have a nice flight, sir.

02:28.274 --> 02:30.818
Oh, I'm counting on it.

02:35.114 --> 02:40.119

how long we've been up?

Oh, uh.... About 40 minutes.

Wow, time really does fly, huh?

03:07.771 --> 03:11.150
Excuse me.
I've gotta stretch my legs.

-It's about 5:45.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.297
-In the morning?
-Yep.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.341
Where does the day go?

05:00.300 --> 05:03.178
-Did you get any sleep last night?
-Yeah, I grabbed a couple hours.

05:03.387 --> 05:04.304
Liar.

05:04.513 --> 05:08.183
I was up at 3, and you were watching
the George Foreman infomercial.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.519
Hey, what can I say? It's riveting TV.

05:10.602 --> 05:14.023
-When's the last time you got sleep?
-Don't know. A little while, I guess.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.983
-It's not a big deal.
-Yeah, it is.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.527
-I appreciate your concern--
-I'm not concerned about you.

05:18.736 --> 05:21.405
It's your job to keep my ass alive.
So I need you sharp.

05:22.531 --> 05:25.409
Seriously, you still having
nightmares about Jess?

05:29.496 --> 05:31.331
Yeah.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.168
But it's not just her, it's everything.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.086
I just forgot, you know,
this job....

05:37.337 --> 05:40.340
-Man, it gets to you.
-You can't let it. You can't bring it home.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.553
So, what, all this,
it never keeps you up at night?

05:45.512 --> 05:48.390
-Never? You're never afraid?
-No, not really.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.442
That's not fear.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.027
That is precaution.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.488
All right, whatever.
I'm too tired to argue.

-Hello?
-Dean. It's Jerry Panowski.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.212
You and your dad helped me out
a couple years back.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.588
Oh, right, yeah.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.508
Up in Kittanning, Pennsylvania.
The poltergeist thing.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.384
-It's not back, is it?
-No.

06:24.593 --> 06:28.472
No. Thank God, no.

06:28.555 --> 06:32.518
But it's something else, and,
well, I think it could be a lot worse.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.354
-What is it?
-Can we talk in person?

06:40.692 --> 06:42.611
Thanks for making the trip so quick.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.823
I ought to be doing you guys a favor,
not the other way around.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.950
Dean and your dad
really helped me out.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.578
-Yeah, he told me. It was a poltergeist?
MAN: Poltergeist? I love that movie.

06:51.787 --> 06:54.373
Hey, nobody's talking to you.
Keep walking.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.960
Damn right it was a poltergeist.
Practically tore our house apart.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.545
Tell you something...

06:59.753 --> 07:03.549
...if it wasn't for you and your dad,
I probably wouldn't be alive.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.468
Your dad said you were
off to college, right?

07:06.969 --> 07:09.555
Yeah, I was.
I'm taking some time off.

07:09.763 --> 07:14.518
He was real proud of you, I could tell.
He talked about you all the time.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.020
-He did?
-Yeah, you bet he did.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.648
Oh, hey, you know, I tried
to get ahold of him, but I couldn't.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.441
How's he doing, anyway?

07:21.650 --> 07:24.778
He's wrapped up in a job right now.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.613
Well, we're missing the old man...

07:26.822 --> 07:29.408
...but we get Sam.
Even trade, huh?

07:29.616 --> 07:31.535
No, not by a long shot.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.580
I got something
I want you guys to hear.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.665
I listened to this.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.668
Well, sounded like it was up your alley.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.920
Normally, I wouldn't have
access to this.

07:42.004 --> 07:46.008
It's the cockpit voice recorder
for United Britannia flight 2485.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.301
It was one of ours.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.094

Mayday. Mayday. Repeat.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.305

...requesting immediate
instructions and help.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.935
MAN: United Britannia flight 2485,
we copy your mayday.

07:57.019 --> 08:00.981
CHUCK: We may be experiencing
some kind of mechanical failure....

08:01.064 --> 08:04.526
(HISSING AND GROWLING)

08:09.656 --> 08:12.868
Took off from here,
crashed about 200 miles south.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.454
Now, they're saying
mechanical failure.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.915
Cabin depressurized somehow,
nobody knows why.

08:18.123 --> 08:21.501
Over 100 people onboard,
only seven got out alive.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.670
Pilot was one.

08:23.879 --> 08:27.549
His name is Chuck Lambert,
he's a good friend of mine. Chuck is....

08:28.884 --> 08:32.304
Well, he's pretty broken up about it.
Like it was his fault.

08:32.554 --> 08:35.724
-You don't think it was.
-No, I don't.

08:35.807 --> 08:39.811
Jerry, we're gonna need
passenger manifests, a list of survivors--

08:39.895 --> 08:42.814
Right. And any way we could
take a look at the wreckage?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.859
The other stuff is no problem,
but the wreckage....

08:46.068 --> 08:50.155
Fellas, the NTSB has it locked down
in an evidence warehouse.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.532
No way I've got that kind of clearance.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.160
No problem.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.376
GIRL: Hey.
-Hi.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.546
You've been in there forever.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.173
You can't rush perfection.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.717
Homeland Security?

09:10.801 --> 09:13.136
That's pretty illegal, even for us.

09:13.220 --> 09:17.933
Yeah, well, it's something new.
People haven't seen it a thousand times.

09:21.603 --> 09:22.980
All right. So, what do you got?

09:23.188 --> 09:25.983
Well, there's definitely E.V.P.
on the cockpit voice recorder.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.609
-Yeah?
-Listen.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.572
WOMAN:
No survivors....

09:34.783 --> 09:37.160
"No survivors"?
What's that supposed to mean?

09:37.369 --> 09:40.580
-There were seven survivors.
-Got me.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.625
What do you think,
a haunted flight?

09:44.167 --> 09:47.796
There's a long history of spirits
and death omens on planes and ships.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.423
-Like Phantom Travelers.
-Uh-huh.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.926
-Or remember flight 401?
-Right. The one that crashed.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.470
And the airline salvaged its parts
for other planes.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.390
Then the spirit of the pilot and copilot
haunted those flights.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.058
-Right.
-Yep.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.643
Maybe we got a similar deal.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.479
So, survivors, who do you
wanna talk to first?

10:04.688 --> 10:07.065
-Third on the list, Max Jaffe.
-Why him?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.942
Well, for one, he's from around here.

10:09.151 --> 10:12.696
And two, if anyone saw
anything weird, he did.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.408
-What makes you say that?
-Well, I spoke to his mother...

10:16.825 --> 10:18.744
...and she told me where to find him.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.915
MAX: I don't understand. I already spoke
with Homeland Security.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.793
DEAN: Right. Some new information
has come up...

10:27.002 --> 10:29.212
...so if you could answer
a couple questions.

10:29.421 --> 10:33.675
Just before the plane went down,
did you notice anything unusual?

10:33.925 --> 10:35.427
Like what?

10:35.635 --> 10:40.766
Strange lights.
Weird noises, maybe. Voices.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.310
No, nothing.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.189
DEAN: Hmm. Mr. Joffe.
-Jaffe.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.734
Jaffe. You checked yourself
in here, right?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.236
-Can I ask why?
-I was a little stressed.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.988
I survived a plane crash.

10:55.405 --> 10:59.701
Uh-huh. And that's what terrified you?
That's what you were afraid of?

10:59.785 --> 11:02.412
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.040
DEAN: I think maybe you did
see something up there.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.458
We need to know what.

11:07.042 --> 11:11.755
No. No, I was delusional.
Seeing things.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.091
He was seeing things.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.096
It's okay.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.682
Then just tell us what
you thought you saw, please.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.941
There was this man.

11:31.149 --> 11:34.528
And he had these...

11:34.736 --> 11:37.280
...eyes, these, uh...

11:38.115 --> 11:40.700
...black eyes.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.537
And I saw him....

11:43.745 --> 11:47.290
Or, I thought I saw him....

11:49.709 --> 11:51.753
What?

11:52.712 --> 11:55.340
He opened the emergency exit.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.886
But that's-- That's impossible, right?

11:59.970 --> 12:04.516
I looked it up. There's something like
2 tons of pressure on that door.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.310
Yeah.

12:07.519 --> 12:11.898
This man, did he seem to appear
and disappear rapidly?

12:12.107 --> 12:13.859
It would look something
like a mirage.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.195
What are you, nuts?

12:18.864 --> 12:22.159
He was a passenger.
He was sitting right in front of me.

12:29.166 --> 12:33.545
SAM: So here we are.
George Phelps, seat 20C.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.883
Hmm. Man, I don't care
how strong you are.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.761
Even yoked up on PCP or something...

12:41.970 --> 12:45.307
...no way you can open up
an emergency door during a flight.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.767
Not if you're human.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.312
But maybe this guy George
was something else.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.606
Some kind of creature, maybe?
In human form?

12:52.981 --> 12:55.984
Does that look like
a creature's lair to you?

13:03.408 --> 13:04.784
This is your late husband?

13:05.869 --> 13:07.621
Yes, that was my George.

13:07.829 --> 13:11.791
-And you said he was a dentist?
BONNIE: Uh-huh.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.337
He was headed to a convention
in Denver.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.342
Do you know that he was
petrified to fly?

13:23.970 --> 13:26.431
For him to go like that....

13:27.849 --> 13:29.476
How long were you married?

13:31.770 --> 13:32.812
Thirteen years.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.856
And all that time...

13:36.274 --> 13:40.195
...did you ever notice anything
strange about him?

13:40.403 --> 13:42.614
Anything out of the ordinary?

13:45.283 --> 13:47.494
Well....

13:48.912 --> 13:51.581
He had acid reflux,
if that's what you mean.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.588
I mean, it goes without saying,
it just doesn't make any sense.

13:58.797 --> 14:02.676
Yeah, a middle-aged dentist with an ulcer
is not exactly evil personified.

14:02.884 --> 14:07.055
We need to get inside that NTSB
warehouse, check out the wreckage.

14:08.306 --> 14:11.643
Okay, but if we're gonna go that route,
we better look the part.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.985
Man, I look like
one of the Blues Brothers.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.486
No, you don't.

14:21.695 --> 14:25.699
You look more like a seventh-grader
at his first dance.

14:27.409 --> 14:31.871
-I hate this thing.
-You want into that warehouse or not?

14:49.848 --> 14:51.933
(BUZZING)

15:14.956 --> 15:16.958
What is that?

15:17.042 --> 15:21.129
It's an EMF meter.
Reads electromagnetic frequencies.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.131
Yeah, I know what an EMF meter is.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.634
But why does that one look like
a busted-up Walkman?

15:26.384 --> 15:29.554
Because that's what I made it out of.
It's homemade.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.725
Yeah, I can see that.

15:55.121 --> 15:58.041
(BEEPING)

15:59.959 --> 16:02.504
Check out the emergency-door handle.

16:07.175 --> 16:10.261
-What is this stuff?
-One way to find out.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.107
Gentlemen.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.401
Homeland Security?

16:24.609 --> 16:27.987
-One team of you guys isn't enough?
-What are you talking about?

16:28.196 --> 16:31.533
Two of your buddies went inside
not five minutes ago.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.103
(ALARM RINGING)

17:10.447 --> 17:13.324
Wow, these monkey suits
do come in handy.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.411
Listen, Chuck,
it's like getting back on a horse.

17:16.619 --> 17:21.207
Only in this case, a little twin-engine.
Not even a horse. More like a pony.

17:21.291 --> 17:25.336
I'll be with you. If you feel like
you don't want the wheel, I'll take it.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.131
Look, Chuck, we don't have
to do this today.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.632
I'm not trying to rush you.

17:29.716 --> 17:33.261
No, the-- The waiting is worse.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.057
Okay, they're filling up the tank,
then we go.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.716
JERRY:
Huh.

18:12.217 --> 18:15.303
-This stuff is covered in sulfur.
-You're sure?

18:15.386 --> 18:16.471
Take a look for yourself.

18:16.554 --> 18:17.680
(MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

18:17.889 --> 18:21.684
If you fellas will excuse me,
I have an idiot to fire.

18:21.893 --> 18:26.189
Hey, Einstein. Yeah, you.
What the heck are you doing?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.441
-Put the wrench down.
DEAN: Hmm.

18:28.525 --> 18:32.529
-Not many things leave a sulfuric residue.
-Demonic possession?

18:32.737 --> 18:36.324
Explains how a mortal man would have
the strength to open an emergency hatch.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.868
If the guy was possessed,
it's possible.

18:39.077 --> 18:42.205
Yeah, but this goes way beyond floating
over a bed or barfing pea soup.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.500
It's one thing to possess a person,
but to take down an airplane?

18:45.583 --> 18:49.462
-You heard of something like this before?
-Never.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.220
I'm ready. Let's do this.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.264
(LOU CHUCKLING)

19:04.310 --> 19:06.354
-How you feeling?
-I feel great.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.398
You'll be back flying jumbos soon.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.149
Hope so.

19:13.194 --> 19:16.322
-How long we been up?
-Almost 40 minutes.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.908
Wow, time really does fly.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.829
What are you doing?

19:50.857 --> 19:57.155
So every religion and world culture has
the concept of demons and possession.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.241
I mean, Christian, Native American,
Hindu, you name it.

20:00.450 --> 20:03.328
-Yeah, but none of them describe this.
-Well, that's not exactly true.

20:03.536 --> 20:07.373
According to Japanese belief, certain
demons are behind certain disasters...

20:07.457 --> 20:09.250
...both natural and man-made.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.502
One causes earthquakes,
another causes disease.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.546
And this one causes plane crashes?

20:17.550 --> 20:20.720
All right. So, what, we have a demon
that's evolved with the times...

20:20.929 --> 20:23.431
...and found a way to ratchet up
the body count?

20:23.640 --> 20:24.891
Yeah.

20:25.099 --> 20:29.145
And, you know, who knows how many
planes it's brought down before this one.

20:33.775 --> 20:34.901
What?

20:35.860 --> 20:38.071
I don't know, man.
This isn't our normal gig.

20:38.571 --> 20:42.742
I mean, demons don't want anything, just
death and destruction for its own sake.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.410
This is big.

20:45.286 --> 20:49.207
-And I wish Dad was here.
-Yeah, me too.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.919
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

20:55.588 --> 20:56.756
-Hello?
JERRY: Dean, it's Jerry.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.759
-Oh, hey, Jerry.
-My pilot friend...

21:01.177 --> 21:03.513
...Chuck Lambert, is dead.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.975
DEAN:
Jerry, I'm sorry. What happened?

21:07.183 --> 21:10.520
He and his buddy went up in
a small twin about an hour ago.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.647
-The plane went down.
-Where'd this happen?

21:12.730 --> 21:15.024
About 60 miles west of here,
near Nazareth.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.694
-I'll try to ignore the irony in that.
-I'm sorry?

21:17.902 --> 21:21.489
Nothing. Jerry, hang in there, all right?
We'll catch up with you soon.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.702
-Another crash?
-Yeah. Let's go.

21:25.910 --> 21:29.080
-Where?
-Nazareth.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.759
Sulfur?

21:43.386 --> 21:45.054
Well, that's great.

21:45.263 --> 21:48.558
All right, so that's two plane crashes
involving Chuck Lambert.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.894
-This demon sounds like it was after him.
-With all due respect to Chuck...

21:51.978 --> 21:55.023
...uh, if that's the case,
that would be the good news.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.943
-What's the bad news?
-His plane went down after 40 minutes.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.654
And get this, so did flight 2485.

22:01.863 --> 22:04.198
Forty minutes. What does that mean?

22:04.407 --> 22:05.658
It's Biblical numerology.

22:05.867 --> 22:09.203
You know, Noah's Ark, it rained for
40 days. The number means death.

22:09.412 --> 22:12.832
I went back, and there have been six
plane crashes over the last decade...

22:13.041 --> 22:15.668
...that all went down
exactly 40 minutes in.

22:16.586 --> 22:19.005
-Any survivors?
-No.

22:19.213 --> 22:23.217
Or, not until now, at least.
Not until flight 2485, for some reason.

22:24.218 --> 22:27.263
On the cockpit voice recorder,
remember what the E.V.P. said?

22:27.472 --> 22:29.432
"No survivors."

22:32.185 --> 22:36.481
It's going after all the survivors.
It's trying to finish the job.

22:39.692 --> 22:43.780
Really? Well, thank you for taking
our survey, and if you do plan to fly...

22:43.988 --> 22:47.408
...please don't forget your friends
at United Britannia Airlines.

22:47.617 --> 22:49.243
Thanks. All right.

22:49.452 --> 22:53.414
Blaine Sanderson and Dennis Holloway
won't be flying any time soon.

22:53.623 --> 22:56.250
So our wild card is the flight attendant,
Amanda Walker.

22:56.459 --> 22:59.587
Right. Her sister Karen said her flight
leaves Indianapolis at 8 p.m.

22:59.796 --> 23:02.215
-Her first night back on the job.
-Just our luck.

23:02.423 --> 23:05.843
Dean, this is a five-hour drive, man,
even with you behind the wheel.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.679
Call Amanda's cell again,
head her off at the pass.

23:08.763 --> 23:13.392
I already left her three voice messages.
She must have turned her cell phone off.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.937
-God, we're never gonna make it.
-Oh, we'll make it.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.161
Right there.
They're boarding in 30 minutes.

23:32.370 --> 23:37.041
Okay. We still have some cards to play.
I need to find a phone.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.087

-Gate 13.

23:41.295 --> 23:43.965
-Who are you calling, sir?
-An Amanda Walker.

Amanda Walker, you have a phone call.

23:50.721 --> 23:53.724
White courtesy phone, gate 13.

23:55.518 --> 23:57.061
Come on.

23:57.979 --> 24:00.773
-This is Amanda Walker.
-Miss Walker.

24:00.857 --> 24:05.111
Hi, this is Dr. James Hetfield
from St. Francis Memorial Hospital.

24:05.236 --> 24:07.697
-We have a Karen Walker here.
-My Karen?

24:07.905 --> 24:11.367
Nothing serious. Just a minor
car accident, but she was injured, so....

24:11.576 --> 24:14.787
Wait, wait. That's impossible.
I just got off the phone with her.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.792
-You what?
-Five minutes ago.

24:19.876 --> 24:23.713
She's at her house
cramming for a final. Who is this?

24:24.338 --> 24:27.216
Uh, well, must be some mistake.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.969
And how would you even know
I was here?

24:30.720 --> 24:32.722
Is this one of Vince's friends?

24:33.973 --> 24:36.017
Guilty as charged.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.311
Wow. This is unbelievable.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.938
He's really sorry.

24:41.147 --> 24:44.525
You tell him to mind his own business
and stay out of my life, okay?

24:44.734 --> 24:48.571
Yes, but he really needs
to see you tonight. So--

24:48.779 --> 24:51.824
-No, I'm sorry. It's too late.
-Don't be like that.

24:51.908 --> 24:54.869
I mean, come on. The guy's a mess.
Really, it's pathetic.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.331
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

24:58.539 --> 24:59.582
Look, I gotta go.

24:59.790 --> 25:03.127
-Tell him to call me when I land.
-No. No, wait. Aman--

25:03.336 --> 25:05.129

25:10.843 --> 25:12.595

25:12.970 --> 25:15.389
-Hey, Bob.
BOB: Hey.

25:22.146 --> 25:25.650
Damn it! That was so close.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.404
All right, it's time for plan B.
We're getting on that plane.

25:30.988 --> 25:32.782
-Now, just hold on a second.
-Dean...

25:32.990 --> 25:35.618
...that plane is leaving
with over 100 passengers.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.704
And if we're right,
that plane is gonna crash.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.164
-I know.
-Okay.

25:40.331 --> 25:43.000
We get on the plane,
find that demon and exorcise it.

25:43.209 --> 25:46.462
Look, I'll get the tickets. You go get
whatever will make it by security.

25:46.671 --> 25:48.506
Meet me back here in five minutes.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.467
Are you okay?

25:53.010 --> 25:54.887
No. Not really.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.223
What? What's wrong?

25:58.808 --> 26:02.019
Well, I kind of have
this problem with, uh....

26:03.187 --> 26:06.107
-Flying?
-It's never really been an issue until now.

26:06.357 --> 26:09.694
-You're joking, right?
-Do I look like I'm joking?

26:10.236 --> 26:12.863
Why do you think I drive
everywhere, Sam?

26:12.947 --> 26:15.032
All right. Uh, I'll go.

26:15.116 --> 26:16.993
-What?
-I'll do this one on my own.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.121
Are you nuts? You said it yourself,
the plane's gonna crash.

26:20.204 --> 26:23.958
We can do it together, I can do it myself.
There's no third option here.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.294
Come on.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.754
Really?

26:30.006 --> 26:31.716
Man....

26:31.924 --> 26:35.136
Flight attendants, please crosscheck
and prepare for departure.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.897
-Just try to relax.
-Just try to shut up.

all right? But you gotta stay focused.

27:27.855 --> 27:30.191
-Okay.
-I mean, we got 32 minutes...

27:30.399 --> 27:33.652
...to track this thing down,
or whoever it's possessing, anyway...

27:33.861 --> 27:37.448
-...and perform a full-on exorcism.
-On a crowded plane. That'll be easy.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.700
Just take it one step at a time,
all right?

27:40.951 --> 27:43.913
Now, who is it possessing?

27:43.996 --> 27:46.957
Well, it's usually gonna be somebody
with a weakness...

27:47.083 --> 27:49.460
...a chink in armor that
the demon can worm through.

27:49.919 --> 27:53.255
Somebody with an addiction
or some sort of emotional distress.

27:54.799 --> 27:57.218
Well, this is Amanda's first flight
after the crash.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.970
-If I were her, I'd be pretty messed up.
-Uh-huh.

28:01.639 --> 28:03.849
Excuse me. Are you Amanda?

28:03.933 --> 28:07.603
-No, I'm not.
-Oh, my mistake.

All right. Well, that's gotta be
Amanda back there.

28:15.277 --> 28:18.114
So I'll go talk to her
and I'll get a read on her mental state.

28:18.322 --> 28:21.117
Right. What if she's already possessed?

28:21.700 --> 28:24.120
There's ways to test that.

28:25.413 --> 28:29.208
-I brought holy water.
-No. We can go more subtle.

28:29.417 --> 28:32.211
If she's possessed,
she'll flinch at the name of God.

-Hey!
-What?

-In Latin, it's Christo.

-Hi.
-Hi.

-Can I help you with something?
-Oh, no.

29:03.159 --> 29:05.286
I'm just a bit of an uneasy flier.

-I feel better when I walk around a bit.
-Oh, it happens to the best of us.

29:09.665 --> 29:13.961
Right. Of course, you being a stewardess,
I guess flying comes easy to you.

29:14.170 --> 29:17.673
-Yeah, you'd be surprised.
-Really? You're a nervous flier?

29:18.132 --> 29:20.384
Yeah, maybe. Little bit.

29:21.093 --> 29:25.139
Now, how is it that being a stewardess,
you're scared to fly?

-Right. I'm sorry for asking.
-It's okay.

-You ever consider other employment?
-No.

29:35.900 --> 29:39.111
Look, everybody's scared of something.
I just, uh....

29:39.695 --> 29:41.822
I'm not gonna let it hold me back.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.033
Huh.

29:44.742 --> 29:46.494
So....

29:48.204 --> 29:49.079
Christo.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.666
I'm sorry, did you say something?

29:56.921 --> 29:58.172
Christo?

29:58.839 --> 30:01.133
I didn't-- I didn't--

30:01.217 --> 30:03.636
Nothing. Never mind.

30:06.347 --> 30:07.848
Okay.

30:15.189 --> 30:18.234
She's gotta be the most well-adjusted
person on the planet.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.443
-You said Christo?
-Yeah.

30:19.527 --> 30:22.154
-And?
-No demon in her. None getting in her.

30:22.238 --> 30:26.242
So if it's on the plane,
it can be anyone, anywhere.

30:26.325 --> 30:30.746
-Come on, that can't be normal.
-Hey, hey. It's just a little turbulence.

30:31.080 --> 30:34.124
Sam, this plane is going to crash,
so quit treating me like I'm 4.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.001
-Calm down.
-I'm sorry, I can't.

30:36.210 --> 30:37.169
Yes, you can.

30:37.753 --> 30:41.131
Dude, stow the touchy-feely, self-help
yoga crap. It's not helping.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.133
If you're panicked,
you're open to possession.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.178
So you need to calm yourself down,
right now.

30:55.271 --> 30:57.189
Good.

30:57.273 --> 31:01.360
Now, I found an exorcism in here
that I think is gonna work.

31:01.443 --> 31:03.654
The Rituale Romanum.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.864
-What do we have to do?
-It's two parts.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.659
The first part expels the demon
from the victim's body.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.495
It makes it manifest,
which makes it more powerful.

31:11.745 --> 31:12.913
-More powerful?
-Yeah.

31:13.122 --> 31:14.081
How?

31:14.290 --> 31:17.501
It doesn't need to possess someone.
It can just wreak havoc on its own.

31:17.835 --> 31:22.715
-Oh. And why is that a good thing?
-Well, because the second part...

31:22.923 --> 31:26.051
...sends the bastard back to hell,
once and for all.

31:27.469 --> 31:30.180
First things first. We gotta find it.

32:06.175 --> 32:08.636
-Oh, man, don't do that.
-Anything?

32:08.844 --> 32:10.971
No, nothing. How much time we got?

32:11.180 --> 32:14.975
Fifteen minutes.
Maybe we missed somebody.

32:15.184 --> 32:17.519
Maybe the thing's
just not on the plane.

32:17.728 --> 32:19.438
You believe that?

32:19.647 --> 32:21.982
Well, I will if you will.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.242
What? What is it?

32:32.451 --> 32:34.453
Christo.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.263
-She's not gonna believe this.
-Twelve minutes, dude.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.059
Oh, hi.

32:57.267 --> 33:00.813
-Flight's not too bumpy for you, I hope.
-That's what we need to talk about.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.148
Um, okay, what can I do for you?

33:03.565 --> 33:04.942
This is gonna sound nuts...

33:05.150 --> 33:07.611
...but we don't have time for
the "truth is out there" speech--

33:07.820 --> 33:11.198
Look, we know you were on flight 2485.

33:11.782 --> 33:14.535
-Who are you guys?
SAM: We've spoken to other survivors.

33:14.743 --> 33:17.871
We know something brought down
the plane, not mechanical failure.

33:18.080 --> 33:21.417
We need your help to stop it
from happening again, here, now.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.545
-I'm sorry, I'm very busy. I have to go--
DEAN: Wait a second.

33:24.628 --> 33:27.631
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
But listen to me.

33:27.715 --> 33:30.843
The pilot from 2485,
Chuck Lambert, he's dead.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.929
What? Chuck is dead?

33:34.304 --> 33:37.558
He died in a plane crash.
That's two plane crashes in two months.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.560
That doesn't strike you as strange?

33:39.768 --> 33:42.813
Something was wrong with 2485.
Maybe you sensed it, maybe not.

33:43.021 --> 33:46.984
-Something's wrong with this flight too.
-Amanda, you have to believe us.

33:51.405 --> 33:52.990
On....

33:53.407 --> 33:58.996
On 2485, there was this man.
He had these eyes.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.706
Yes. That's what we're talking about.

34:00.956 --> 34:04.460
-I don't understand what you want.
-Bring the copilot back here.

34:04.668 --> 34:07.504
-What does he have to do with anything?
-No time to explain.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.131
We just need to talk to him.

34:09.339 --> 34:12.509
-How am I supposed to get the copilot--?
-Do whatever it takes.

34:12.593 --> 34:15.512
Tell him something's broken.
Whatever will get him out here.

34:15.596 --> 34:20.434
-I could lose my job if--
-You'll lose a lot more if you don't.

34:25.689 --> 34:27.441
Okay.

35:06.563 --> 35:08.565
Now, what's the problem?

35:14.279 --> 35:18.534
-You said you were gonna talk to him.
DEAN: We are gonna talk to him.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.502
Oh, my God.
What's wrong with him?

35:28.710 --> 35:30.754
We need you calm, outside the curtain.

35:30.963 --> 35:33.924
Don't let anybody in, okay?
Can you do that?

35:34.591 --> 35:37.302
-Amanda.
-Okay. Okay.

35:38.804 --> 35:42.349
DEAN: Hurry up, Sam. I don't know
how much longer I can hold him.

35:42.891 --> 35:46.436
(SPEAKING IN LATIN)

36:02.911 --> 36:04.788
I know what happened
to your girlfriend.

36:06.582 --> 36:11.587
She must have died screaming.
Even now, she's burning.

36:13.463 --> 36:14.506
Sam!

36:17.593 --> 36:21.430
(SPEAKING IN LATIN)

36:21.513 --> 36:23.473
I got him.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.578
SAM: Where'd it go?
-Into the plane.

36:44.786 --> 36:47.497
Hurry up, we gotta finish it.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.501
(SCREAMING)

37:23.492 --> 37:26.244
(SPEAKING IN LATIN)

37:29.039 --> 37:31.166
(SCREAMING)

38:34.021 --> 38:35.897
MAN 1:
They're coming off right now.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.858
MAN 2: Sir, what happened?
-I don't know.

38:37.941 --> 38:41.028
I was walking through the airport,
then it all goes blank.

38:41.111 --> 38:44.156
I don't even remember
getting on the plane.

38:44.865 --> 38:48.410
FBI AGENT: Is there anything else?
-No, that's all.

38:51.204 --> 38:52.748
Thank you.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.756
Let's get out of here.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.551
You okay?

39:05.135 --> 39:06.803
Dean...

39:07.763 --> 39:10.766
...it knew about Jessica.

39:12.059 --> 39:14.770
Sam, these things, they read minds.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.229
They lie.

39:16.396 --> 39:18.565
All right? That's all it was.

39:19.316 --> 39:20.776
Yeah.

39:22.444 --> 39:23.945
Come on.

39:29.284 --> 39:32.537
Nobody knows what you guys did,
but I do.

39:33.038 --> 39:35.665
A lot of people could have been killed.

39:36.166 --> 39:39.294
-Your dad's gonna be real proud.
-We'll see you around, Jerry.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.925
-Hey, you know, Jerry?
JERRY: Yeah?

39:45.133 --> 39:47.928
I meant to ask, how did you get
my cell phone number, anyway?

39:48.136 --> 39:50.889
-I've only had it for six months.
-Your dad gave it to me.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.350
-What?
-Well, when did you talk to him?

39:53.558 --> 39:56.269
Well, I mean,
I didn't exactly talk to him...

39:56.478 --> 40:00.273
...but I called his number,
his voice message said to give you a call.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.151
Thanks again, guys.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.587
This doesn't make any sense, man.
I've called Dad's number like 50 times.

40:22.796 --> 40:24.714
It's been out of service.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.759
JOHN: This is John Winchester.
I can't be reached.

40:27.968 --> 40:30.971
If this is an emergency,
call my son, Dean...

40:31.346 --> 40:36.935
...(785) 555-0179.

40:37.018 --> 40:39.062
He can help.
