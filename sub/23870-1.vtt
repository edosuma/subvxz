Sorry!

01:15.568 --> 01:16.600
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

01:16.602 --> 01:19.334
<i>That's not the story
we're telling.</i>

01:19.336 --> 01:23.171
<i>No. We're here
for Peter Rabbit.</i>

01:23.173 --> 01:25.040
<i>The hero of our tale.</i>

01:26.210 --> 01:29.682
<i>A young rabbit in a blue coat
and no pants.</i>

01:34.786 --> 01:37.253
Hey! Pick on someone
your own size.

01:37.255 --> 01:38.321
My pleasure.

01:38.323 --> 01:39.759
Oh! I didn't mean me.

01:43.094 --> 01:44.193
Ow!

01:51.169 --> 01:53.804
Going into his
garden again, I see.

01:53.806 --> 01:56.807
There are safer ways
to get a meal, you know!

01:56.809 --> 01:58.239
Yeah, but they're not as fun.

01:59.812 --> 02:00.945
Oi.

02:00.947 --> 02:03.378
What did I tell you about
sneakin' into McGregor's?

02:03.380 --> 02:05.615
Make sure to
get you some cauliflower?

02:05.617 --> 02:07.151
That's a good boy.
Now, off you get.

02:10.187 --> 02:11.987
All right,
talk to me, Benjamin.

02:11.989 --> 02:12.889
He's mowed half the lawn,

02:12.891 --> 02:14.827
which maybe gives us
just enough time.

02:15.627 --> 02:16.827
Look at him.

02:16.829 --> 02:18.094
Pure evil.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.095
Even cuts grass angry.

02:20.097 --> 02:21.330
Hey, here's a crazy thought.

02:21.332 --> 02:22.865
What if we don't go in,

02:22.867 --> 02:24.967
because last time,
you almost got caught.

02:24.969 --> 02:26.235
You're so adorable.

02:26.237 --> 02:27.202
I could just eat you up.

02:27.204 --> 02:29.841
That's exactly what
he wants to do to you.

02:31.676 --> 02:33.175
Higher. Higher.

02:33.177 --> 02:36.045
Why are you always on top?

02:36.047 --> 02:37.245
Because I'm the oldest.

02:37.247 --> 02:39.015
We're triplets!

02:39.017 --> 02:40.416
I'm still the oldest.

02:40.418 --> 02:43.386
By 16 seconds.

02:43.388 --> 02:46.154
Ugh. When's the last time
you brushed your tail?

02:46.156 --> 02:47.823
Whoa!

02:47.825 --> 02:49.325
All right, rest time's over.
Come on.

02:49.327 --> 02:50.392
- Yeah.
- Race you.

02:50.394 --> 02:52.394
Not if I race you first.

02:52.396 --> 02:53.829
No fair.

03:03.407 --> 03:04.239
Take it all in

03:04.241 --> 03:08.177
because we're about
to take it all in.

03:08.179 --> 03:11.446
Sorry. I don't know
why I'm so out of shape.

03:11.448 --> 03:12.882
I only eat salad.

03:12.884 --> 03:14.885
It's the dressing.
Get it on the side.

03:14.887 --> 03:16.351
Or just have
a drizzle of lemon.

03:16.353 --> 03:18.154
It'll change your life,
trust me.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.790
Right. You all know the drill.

03:19.792 --> 03:21.725
I'm not gonna pretend
that what we're about to do

03:21.727 --> 03:24.292
isn't reckless, foolhardy,
even dangerous.

03:24.294 --> 03:25.427
But we will succeed,

03:25.429 --> 03:27.798
because each of us
plays a vital role

03:27.800 --> 03:30.965
specifically tailored
to our individual talents.

03:30.967 --> 03:33.168
Lookout. Lookout.
Lookout. Lookout.

03:33.170 --> 03:34.202
Hero.

03:34.204 --> 03:35.337
Hmm.

03:35.339 --> 03:36.439
Now let's do this.

03:36.441 --> 03:37.874
Right behind ya.

03:37.876 --> 03:39.007
- Not a chance.
- Why?

03:39.009 --> 03:41.177
Are you afraid I'm gonna get
my foot caught in a trap

03:41.179 --> 03:43.244
and I'll have to gnaw it off, and
then you'll call me "Stumpy"

03:43.246 --> 03:45.916
for the rest of my life, and
I'll have a horrifying scar,

03:45.918 --> 03:48.920
but all the real scars
will be on the inside?

03:50.823 --> 03:52.053
Sorry you had to hear that.

03:52.055 --> 03:54.189
It's okay. We're family.
This is a safe space.

03:54.191 --> 03:56.092
All right, bring it in.

03:56.094 --> 03:57.358
- We all ready?
- Yep.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.862
- Absolutely.
- Always.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.733
- I guess.
- Love you guys.

04:01.332 --> 04:02.669
Now, let's do this.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.433
It's gonna be a fun one.

04:23.488 --> 04:26.254
Lettuce, radishes, radicchio.

04:26.256 --> 04:28.223
I'll tell you
what's "radicchio."

04:28.225 --> 04:31.393
How easy it is to steal
this man's vegetables.

04:31.395 --> 04:35.263
Because "radicchio"
sounds like "ridiculous."

04:35.265 --> 04:36.967
Don't explain the joke.

04:40.104 --> 04:41.437
- Flopsy!
- Yeah!

04:41.439 --> 04:43.071
Mopsy!

04:43.073 --> 04:44.076
Cotton-Tail!

04:45.242 --> 04:46.778
Oh.

04:47.545 --> 04:48.915
I'm good!

04:54.285 --> 04:56.184
Tomayto, tomahto.

04:56.186 --> 04:57.987
Potayto, potahto.

04:57.989 --> 05:00.556
No one actually says "potahto,"
have you noticed that?

05:00.558 --> 05:02.023
Stop messing around.

05:02.025 --> 05:03.124
I can mess around all I want.

05:03.126 --> 05:05.326
He can't hear us
over the lawn...

05:07.131 --> 05:08.263
Mower.

05:15.507 --> 05:16.539
Rabbits.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.825
No, no, stop.

05:51.275 --> 05:52.307
- Leave.
- Scram.

05:52.309 --> 05:53.310
Get out of there.

06:03.555 --> 06:04.924
Hmm.

06:07.459 --> 06:08.625
Peter, no.

06:08.627 --> 06:10.158
- I'm gonna put this in there.
- Don't do that.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.628
- You think this is a bad idea?
- Yes, it's a bad idea.

06:12.630 --> 06:14.598
I'm getting mixed signals.
Yes or no?

06:14.600 --> 06:15.533
It's a definite no.

06:15.535 --> 06:17.500
I can't see your
mouth through the gate.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.635
No. No. No. No.

06:19.637 --> 06:21.002
- I think you said yes.
- No.

06:21.004 --> 06:23.505
- I'm going with "yes."
- No, no, Peter.

06:23.507 --> 06:25.273
- What?
- Oh, God.

06:25.275 --> 06:26.277
Oh, no.

06:26.612 --> 06:27.979
No.

06:28.378 --> 06:30.647
Peter. No!

06:38.656 --> 06:40.827
- Get out of there.
- Ooh.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.960
Rabbit, I'm gonna
put you in a pie.

06:44.962 --> 06:46.295
Leave the jacket.

06:46.297 --> 06:48.099
Like I did your dad.

06:54.639 --> 06:56.940
Morning, Mr. McGregor.

06:56.942 --> 06:58.107
Oh, it's you.

06:58.109 --> 06:59.975
Beautiful day, isn't it?

06:59.977 --> 07:01.110
Give me that rabbit.

07:01.112 --> 07:03.080
You got a little
something in your...

07:05.683 --> 07:07.052
You're okay.

07:09.488 --> 07:10.857
Are you okay?

07:11.690 --> 07:13.187
Did he just wink?

07:13.189 --> 07:15.491
I didn't even know
we could do that.

07:15.493 --> 07:16.992
You look very well.

07:16.994 --> 07:19.127
That vein that's usually bulging out
of your head's really calmed down.

07:19.129 --> 07:20.362
Have you been meditating?

07:20.364 --> 07:22.468
This is my garden.

07:23.366 --> 07:25.033
Let me pass that along.

07:25.035 --> 07:28.336
This is his garden.

07:28.338 --> 07:29.972
There we are.

07:29.974 --> 07:31.172
I think we're
all on the same page.

07:31.174 --> 07:32.975
So these rabbits
will now surrender

07:32.977 --> 07:35.945
their natural instinct
to feed themselves.

07:35.947 --> 07:39.047
Next time will be their last.

07:39.049 --> 07:41.285
I'll be sure to
pass that along, too.

07:43.287 --> 07:45.090
Oh. Come on, sweeties.

07:46.090 --> 07:46.989
Come on.

07:46.991 --> 07:48.558
<i>This is Bea.</i>

07:48.560 --> 07:52.026
<i>She's next-door neighbor to Mr.
McGregor and the rabbits.</i>

07:52.028 --> 07:53.429
<i>Guess which one
she likes better?</i>

07:53.431 --> 07:56.198
Inside. Come on. I'll get
you something to drink.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.033
You must stop going in there.

07:58.035 --> 07:59.906
You almost
got caught this time.

08:00.338 --> 08:01.671
Come here, little one.

08:01.673 --> 08:03.439
Dry you off.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.808
<i>She's an artist.</i>

08:04.810 --> 08:07.476
<i>She moved out to the country
to work on her paintings.</i>

08:07.478 --> 08:11.613
<i>Oh, don't feel bad if you don't
understand them, like them,</i>

08:11.615 --> 08:13.381
<i>even know which way to
look at them.</i>

08:13.383 --> 08:16.486
<i>They are terrible
and she knows it.</i>

08:16.488 --> 08:19.458
<i>So for fun, she's been painting
portraits of the locals.</i>

08:20.558 --> 08:21.591
<i>Beautiful.</i>

08:21.593 --> 08:23.391
<i>But a constant reminder</i>

08:23.393 --> 08:26.131
<i>of what Peter and his family
had gone through.</i>

09:33.163 --> 09:36.397
I promise I'll always
be here for you.

09:36.399 --> 09:37.533
<i>And she has,</i>

09:37.535 --> 09:39.471
<i>ever since their mother died.</i>

09:42.339 --> 09:43.340
Oh.

09:43.774 --> 09:45.275
The rain stopped.

09:47.711 --> 09:49.646
Sorry about Dad's jacket.

09:49.648 --> 09:51.714
I'm sorry you
lost Dad's jacket.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.815
I just said that.

09:52.817 --> 09:54.415
Yeah, but coming
from the oldest,

09:54.417 --> 09:56.853
it just kind of means more.

09:56.855 --> 09:58.252
Just a jacket.

09:58.254 --> 09:59.789
Dad and Mum are still in here.

09:59.791 --> 10:03.324
And here. And here.
And here. And here.

10:03.326 --> 10:05.260
But less so with you,
since you're just a cousin,

10:05.262 --> 10:07.195
you know. You're a nephew,
and by marriage.

10:07.197 --> 10:08.665
I'm not taking
anything away, I'm just...

10:08.667 --> 10:10.467
You know,
I want to be accurate.

10:10.469 --> 10:13.506
Okay, just promise me
you'll stay out of the garden.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.308
Got it back, Dad.

10:57.548 --> 10:58.650
Got you, rabbit.

10:59.884 --> 11:01.751
I knew you'd come.

11:03.220 --> 11:06.224
The lady's not here
to protect you now.

11:12.563 --> 11:16.100
I've got a hankering
for pie tonight.

11:16.668 --> 11:18.504
Rabbit pie.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.179
Huh?

11:30.649 --> 11:31.649
What?

11:37.855 --> 11:39.224
What?

11:41.425 --> 11:42.427
Whoa.

11:42.693 --> 11:43.792
Is he...

11:45.629 --> 11:47.364
That's pretty conclusive.

11:48.398 --> 11:49.932
Very conclusive.

11:49.934 --> 11:52.302
That means that... That I...

11:52.703 --> 11:53.802
That I...

11:53.804 --> 11:55.671
That I did it. I did it.

11:55.673 --> 11:56.806
- What?
- I did it.

11:56.808 --> 11:59.575
Got rid of him. Who's hungry?
Bite into those guys.

11:59.577 --> 12:01.275
You went into his garden?

12:01.277 --> 12:03.277
No. I went into our garden.

12:03.279 --> 12:04.445
Without lookouts?

12:04.447 --> 12:06.549
That's the sort of thing
that will get someone killed.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.282
And it did.

12:08.284 --> 12:09.819
McGregor's gone?

12:09.821 --> 12:11.285
He's in a better place now.

12:11.287 --> 12:12.555
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:12.557 --> 12:16.357
That ice cream truck
with the flashing lights.

12:16.359 --> 12:18.560
<i>In actuality,
Peter couldn't even claim</i>

12:18.562 --> 12:20.963
<i>that he gave the old man's
heart a fright.</i>

12:20.965 --> 12:23.365
<i>Credit for that
goes to 78 years</i>

12:23.367 --> 12:26.204
<i>of terrible lifestyle choices.</i>

12:33.845 --> 12:35.677
- Wow.
- No way.

12:35.679 --> 12:38.948
All right, this is our land now, so
let's not go crazy straightaway.

12:38.950 --> 12:41.382
It's our job to nurture it,
to sustain it,

12:41.384 --> 12:42.752
prepare for the future.

12:42.754 --> 12:45.854
With privilege, comes
responsibility...

12:45.856 --> 12:48.690
I'm sorry. I almost got through
that with a straight face.

12:48.692 --> 12:49.694

big fella.

Wait, didn't you...
Did you try to eat me?

13:51.822 --> 13:53.455
It was you! I knew it.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.858
How are you? So good to see you.

13:55.860 --> 13:56.926
Hey, little rabbit.

13:56.928 --> 13:58.761
Got your land back, I see.

13:58.763 --> 14:00.829
All hail the prodigal son.

14:00.831 --> 14:03.733
- It's no big deal.
- No, no, a very big deal.

14:03.735 --> 14:05.568
You vanquished McGregor.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.869
Well, if vanquished
means I said to him,

14:07.871 --> 14:09.472
"I've had enough
of your tyranny."

14:09.474 --> 14:11.574
And he said,
"I will put you in a pie."

14:11.576 --> 14:14.544
And I said, "No, sir.
I will put you in a pie, sir."

14:14.546 --> 14:16.548
It doesn't, but thank you for
the party.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.381
Was Pigling eating celery?

14:19.383 --> 14:21.850
It's a shame when you
don't know who you are

14:21.852 --> 14:23.453
or where you belong, you know?

14:23.455 --> 14:24.686
Mmm-hmm.

14:24.688 --> 14:26.088
Want some?

14:26.090 --> 14:27.456
Ah, I'll just take one.

14:28.692 --> 14:30.092
Oh, oh, oh!

14:31.663 --> 14:33.698
Thanks, Tommy.
You're one of the good ones.

14:34.965 --> 14:38.132
Hey! This garden comes
with a free house!

14:41.773 --> 14:44.773

- Whoa!

15:10.167 --> 15:11.602
- No more!
- No more!

15:15.539 --> 15:17.439
<i>Meet Thomas McGregor.</i>

15:17.441 --> 15:19.941
<i>Or, as he is known
in the store where he works,</i>

15:19.943 --> 15:21.810
<i>Mr. McGregor.</i>

15:21.812 --> 15:24.445
<i>You're seeing him

15:24.447 --> 15:26.648
<i>Preparing his troops

15:26.650 --> 15:29.083
<i>People who say
you can't control everything</i>

15:29.085 --> 15:31.152
<i>haven't met this Mr. McGregor.</i>

15:31.154 --> 15:34.623
72.043 degrees.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.761
The angle at which Apollo 13
was launched.

15:38.428 --> 15:40.662
I know, Carlos,
you think I'm crazy.

15:40.664 --> 15:41.830
But the little girl
who wants to be an astronaut

15:41.832 --> 15:45.434
is going to know, and you've
just blown up her dreams.

15:45.436 --> 15:46.469
This is a nightmare.

15:46.471 --> 15:48.937
You've got to toss and fluff,
toss and fluff.

15:48.939 --> 15:50.506
It's the small things.

15:50.508 --> 15:52.908
You mustn't be afraid
to really get in there, gang.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.780
Our toilets should be clean
as a drinking fountain.

15:56.947 --> 15:58.447
Mr. McGregor.

15:58.449 --> 16:00.616
The general manager
has asked to see you.

16:00.618 --> 16:02.517
This is it. My promotion.

16:02.519 --> 16:03.788
They said
it could be this week.

16:05.789 --> 16:06.855
How do I look?

16:06.857 --> 16:08.897
Like a man about to drink
toilet water from a straw?

16:09.125 --> 16:10.192
Perfect.

16:10.194 --> 16:12.829
I have some bad news, Thomas.

16:12.831 --> 16:15.096
- No.
- Your great-uncle passed away.

16:15.098 --> 16:16.732
I just received word.

16:16.734 --> 16:19.535
I'm very sorry.

16:19.537 --> 16:21.136
I didn't even know
I had a great-uncle.

16:21.138 --> 16:22.805
What about the promotion?

16:22.807 --> 16:24.706
- Excuse me?
- The associate general manager.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.943
The post I've been working
towards for the last 10 years.

16:26.945 --> 16:30.145
You're in shock, I understand.
In times of grief...

16:30.147 --> 16:31.714
No, there's no grief.
I just want to know.

16:31.716 --> 16:33.682
Did I get
the promotion or not?

16:33.684 --> 16:35.951
- No. It went to Bannerman.
- Bannerman?

16:35.953 --> 16:38.588
But he is an imbecile.
I mean, he's not even that.

16:38.590 --> 16:39.555
To be rightfully
called an imbecile,

16:39.557 --> 16:42.156
would be aspirational
for Nigel Bannerman.

16:42.158 --> 16:45.560
But he also happens to be the
managing director's nephew.

16:45.562 --> 16:47.897
So you're promoting a
flagrantly unqualified half-wit

16:47.899 --> 16:50.232
to a position of immense importance
based purely on nepotism.

16:50.234 --> 16:51.967
This is Great Britain.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.936
It's practically
written in our charter.

16:54.938 --> 16:57.540
You think I want
our best man passed over?

16:57.542 --> 17:00.040
Well, then,
don't pass me over.

17:00.042 --> 17:04.112
This is not the time to be
thinking about work, Thomas.

17:04.114 --> 17:05.280
Take some time.

17:05.281 --> 17:07.214
Take as much time as you like.

17:07.215 --> 17:09.251
No, I don't want time!
I'm sorry.

17:09.252 --> 17:11.685
I don't want... I'm sorry.

17:11.688 --> 17:13.253
I want the promotion,
is the thing,

17:13.256 --> 17:14.723
and I deserve the promotion.

17:14.726 --> 17:16.694
Give me the promotion, June,
I won't tell anyone.

17:16.993 --> 17:17.993
Please.

17:19.029 --> 17:20.566
Give me the promotion.

17:24.134 --> 17:25.267
Sorry.

17:25.269 --> 17:26.967
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's all right.

17:26.969 --> 17:28.473
- Sorry, sir.
- Maybe next time.

17:30.139 --> 17:31.909
What up, McG...

17:34.779 --> 17:35.781
Bannerman.

17:36.178 --> 17:37.244
Congratulations.

17:37.246 --> 17:38.614
I didn't even want it.

17:38.616 --> 17:40.084
I was in Ibiza last night.

17:41.051 --> 17:42.317
Heavy lies the crown, yeah?

17:44.154 --> 17:45.252
Pow.

17:46.757 --> 17:49.025
I'm taking a break.
I'll be in my big office.

Why did you treat me...

18:10.179 --> 18:11.312
I'm sorry.

18:14.318 --> 18:17.251
This might actually be
a blessing in disguise.

18:17.253 --> 18:19.821
Get some perspective.
Get a hobby.

18:19.823 --> 18:22.758
Get some dirt underneath
your fingernails.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.794
You sound like every employer,
teacher, family member,

18:25.796 --> 18:28.229
friend, and vague acquaintance
I've ever had.

18:28.231 --> 18:30.800
I'm going to take
your name tag now, Thomas.

18:30.802 --> 18:31.803
No, not...

18:33.337 --> 18:34.770
Welcome to Harrods.

18:34.772 --> 18:37.706
I hope you enjoy drinking
dirty toilet water.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.842
Might I suggest some time
in the country?

18:40.844 --> 18:42.042
It's calming.

Yeah!

18:55.058 --> 18:57.696

18:58.729 --> 19:01.963
Oh, yeah, now it's a party.

19:01.965 --> 19:04.570
- Hors d'oeuvres?
- I'll just take one.

19:08.237 --> 19:10.740
No, it's hitch kick,
then boogaloo.

19:10.742 --> 19:13.375
When am I going to
get to choreograph?

19:13.377 --> 19:15.076
When you're the oldest.

19:15.078 --> 19:16.745
Aw, I can't wait that long.

19:16.747 --> 19:18.747
Hey, let's go
get Mum and Dad.

19:18.749 --> 19:20.181
Where do you want it, Peter?

19:20.183 --> 19:21.348
Oh, anywhere's fine.

19:21.350 --> 19:24.251
I mean, maybe a...
Maybe a little higher?

19:24.253 --> 19:26.221
A lit... No, too much.
A little lower.

19:26.223 --> 19:28.694
Hmm, to the left.
No, to the right.

19:29.158 --> 19:31.358
More. Too far. Lower.

He's gone now, guys.

19:51.683 --> 19:53.619

you were here to enjoy it.

20:16.707 --> 20:19.007
Oh, from Windermere?
Fancy place, that.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.710
I don't know anyone from
Windermere.

20:20.712 --> 20:22.010
Well, it's from
Unclaimed Property.

20:22.012 --> 20:24.011
Usually means
you've inherited something.

20:24.013 --> 20:26.414
<i>Inherited
something, he did.</i>

20:26.416 --> 20:28.818
<i>From that great-uncle
he knew nothing about.</i>

<i>Turns out intimacy issues

20:31.321 --> 20:33.789
Windermere?
That's in the country.

20:33.791 --> 20:34.724
Well, fancy country.

20:34.726 --> 20:36.895
The houses there
go for a king's ransom.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.127
Ransom enough to
buy my own toy shop?

20:40.129 --> 20:41.062
I'd imagine so.

20:41.064 --> 20:42.230
And fill it with the finest
merchandise?

20:42.232 --> 20:43.197
Should do, yeah.

20:43.199 --> 20:44.733
Ransom enough to have
tempered glass shelving

20:44.735 --> 20:45.769
and seasonal
window decorations?

20:45.771 --> 20:48.368
That I might have to do
some research on, sir.

20:48.370 --> 20:50.174
Can I get back to you
mail-time tomorrow?

20:57.313 --> 20:59.313
Round trip to Windermere,

Good evening. Are you
aware of this location?

21:14.363 --> 21:15.865
- The McGregor manor?
- Yes.

21:15.867 --> 21:17.232
- Is that where you're staying?
- It's just temporary.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.833
I am merely appraising
the manor's condition

21:18.835 --> 21:20.502
before putting it
on the market to sell.

21:20.504 --> 21:22.841
But you do want me
to take you there?

21:23.072 --> 21:23.972
Yes.

21:23.974 --> 21:25.007
- Well, hop in.
- Thank you.

21:25.009 --> 21:26.876
I think you're really going
to love living there.

21:26.878 --> 21:28.376
Please don't talk to me
on the drive.

21:29.411 --> 21:31.146
- Give it to me.
- Here.

21:34.984 --> 21:37.855
I can fly! Oh!

21:39.321 --> 21:40.822
I think I cracked a rib.

21:40.824 --> 21:42.190
How many ribs do we have?

21:42.192 --> 21:44.058
- Thirteen.
- No way.

21:44.060 --> 21:45.193
Sweet.

21:45.195 --> 21:46.529
Oh, no, but don't...

21:46.531 --> 21:48.032
I can fly...

21:49.232 --> 21:50.666
Oh.

21:50.668 --> 21:53.001
It's nothing against the country.
I just find it disgusting.

21:53.003 --> 21:55.270
Yes, you've made that
quite clear on the journey, sir.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.137
I would just like
the record to reflect that.

21:57.139 --> 22:00.140
Well, I shall create a record
and make sure that it reflects it.

22:00.142 --> 22:02.443

22:02.445 --> 22:05.146
Oh, dear. Everybody out! Out!

You know, it's like, who am I?

22:11.388 --> 22:13.489

22:13.491 --> 22:16.457
You know, like,

Oh, your quills

No, just because
you can't see him,

23:01.137 --> 23:03.504
doesn't mean he can't
see you. Understand?

23:03.506 --> 23:05.811
- Mmm-hmm.
- Now hide!

23:06.309 --> 23:07.175
What? No, Tommy.

23:07.177 --> 23:10.310
Now you're just

24:08.437 --> 24:09.971
Get out!

24:09.973 --> 24:14.177
Every single one of you!
Out, you vermin!

24:18.716 --> 24:20.648
Stay out of my house!

24:20.650 --> 24:22.349
He had the key.

24:22.351 --> 24:24.520
He must be a McGregor.

24:24.522 --> 24:25.990
Oh.

24:27.491 --> 24:29.290
Headlights.

24:29.292 --> 24:32.292
Felix, blink.
Blink, blink, blink, blink.

24:32.294 --> 24:33.729
Come on, big guy.
Blink, blink, blink.

24:33.731 --> 24:36.030
Headlights.

24:36.032 --> 24:37.472
Come on, deer.

24:45.308 --> 24:47.075
The sun came up again?

24:47.077 --> 24:48.342
I can't believe it!

24:48.344 --> 24:50.979
I thought when I closed
my eyes last night,

24:50.981 --> 24:52.013
that that was it!

24:52.015 --> 24:56.384
But we have another day of this!
Whoo-hoo!

25:06.161 --> 25:07.464
It wasn't a nightmare.

25:11.001 --> 25:12.537
Oh. It's a nightmare.

25:37.561 --> 25:39.494
What is that music?

25:39.496 --> 25:40.530
I don't know.

25:40.532 --> 25:44.065
But it sounds very dramatic
and life-changing.

25:55.244 --> 25:56.512
Oh.

25:56.514 --> 25:58.614
Hello, sweeties.

25:58.616 --> 26:00.682
You checking
on the new neighbor?

26:00.684 --> 26:02.416
Don't worry.
He can't be any worse

26:02.418 --> 26:04.988
than the old crab bucket,
rest his soul.

26:06.055 --> 26:08.523
Never know, maybe he'll be
a nice, normal man.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.526
He looks nice.

26:10.126 --> 26:11.392
Looks very normal.

26:12.796 --> 26:14.598
That's not very normal, is it?

26:15.666 --> 26:16.764
That's normal.

26:18.502 --> 26:19.537
Hmm.

26:20.603 --> 26:22.369
Anyway,
it's gonna be exciting.

26:22.371 --> 26:24.371
We'll have somebody
new around here.

26:24.373 --> 26:26.574
They're not all bad,
I promise.

26:26.576 --> 26:27.810
I'll explain it to him.

26:27.812 --> 26:30.147
We all share
our land around here.

26:33.248 --> 26:35.151
I'm gonna give him the benefit
of the doubt.

26:38.688 --> 26:39.788
Oh, no.

26:39.790 --> 26:42.359
It's not over. We can
always go in the back...

26:43.460 --> 26:44.525
Or through the...

26:44.527 --> 26:45.529
Or use the...

26:45.862 --> 26:47.360
Or behind the...

26:47.362 --> 26:48.830
I didn't even know
that was a way in.

26:48.832 --> 26:51.466
I see the gates
are back up, huh?

26:51.468 --> 26:54.367
I guess you weren't
the prodigal son after all.

26:54.369 --> 26:56.839
That'll do, pig. That'll do.

26:56.841 --> 26:58.172
It was a fun night, though.

26:58.174 --> 27:00.676
I haven't eaten that much
in a long time.

27:00.678 --> 27:02.711
The diet starts now.

27:04.313 --> 27:05.314
Now.

27:06.315 --> 27:08.052
- Now.
- Hey, look.

27:09.252 --> 27:10.421
Now.

27:11.186 --> 27:12.521
Hello. Oh, sorry.

27:12.523 --> 27:15.756
I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Bea.
I just live over here.

27:15.758 --> 27:18.126
Oh. Hello. I'm Thomas.

27:18.128 --> 27:21.330
I live way over there
in London.

27:22.331 --> 27:23.332
That way.

27:24.300 --> 27:26.467
Yes. I'm just
here temporarily.

27:26.469 --> 27:28.301
I'm fixing up
this place to sell,

27:28.303 --> 27:30.171
using the proceeds
to open my own toy store,

27:30.173 --> 27:31.039
preferably near Harrods

27:31.041 --> 27:33.541
so they can witness
their own downfall.

27:33.543 --> 27:36.243
Oh, my. That's a lot
of information right there.

27:36.245 --> 27:37.310
- Sorry.
- Good for you

27:37.312 --> 27:38.279
for not being
afraid to open up.

27:38.281 --> 27:40.682
- What are they saying?
- Shh, I can read lips.

27:40.684 --> 27:42.415
I'm just a little
out of my element.

27:42.417 --> 27:44.653
I think you'll find the elements
here are pretty fabulous.

27:44.655 --> 27:47.622
"I think you'll find
the elephants around here

27:47.624 --> 27:49.560
"are really flatulent."

27:49.860 --> 27:51.091
What?

27:51.093 --> 27:54.361
In my opinion, it's just the
most beautiful place on Earth.

27:54.363 --> 27:56.633
Well, it just got
a lot more beautiful.

27:57.534 --> 27:59.102
Oh, gee.

27:59.637 --> 28:01.368
You didn't just say that.

28:01.370 --> 28:04.108
And clean, sturdy, functional.

28:04.542 --> 28:06.374
Oh, the gate.

28:06.376 --> 28:08.877
- Yes.
- I thought you were saying

28:08.879 --> 28:10.411
- I was beautiful.
- Did you...

28:10.413 --> 28:12.714
No, no, no. No,
I wouldn't say that.

28:12.716 --> 28:13.849
I wouldn't say that.

28:13.851 --> 28:16.349
- I would say that. I'm not...
- No, hey, I'm not fishing.

28:16.351 --> 28:17.819
- It's fine.
- You are beautiful.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.388
And you're different
to the gate.

28:20.925 --> 28:23.524
I can't read lips,
but I know her,

28:23.526 --> 28:25.694
and she's telling him
to take down those gates,

28:25.696 --> 28:26.928
and let us into the garden.

28:26.930 --> 28:29.230
Well, enjoy your brief stay.

28:29.232 --> 28:31.934
Just, please, don't be
like the nasty old man

28:31.936 --> 28:33.868
who used to live here.
He was a real twit.

28:33.870 --> 28:35.736
- He was my uncle.
- You didn't let me finish.

28:35.738 --> 28:37.140
He was a real...

28:39.677 --> 28:41.643
Sorry, I can't...

28:41.645 --> 28:44.780
No. There's no saving that one.
He was a real twit.

28:44.782 --> 28:45.848
- No offense.
- None taken.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.553
- I never knew him.
- You seem much more reasonable.

28:48.785 --> 28:49.918
Do I?

28:49.920 --> 28:52.920
Although, I must say, these
gates are incredibly sturdy.

28:52.922 --> 28:54.989
Are you expecting
an alien invasion?

28:54.991 --> 28:58.259
I just need to keep the
wildlife out where they belong.

28:58.261 --> 29:00.494
Well, they actually belong
everywhere.

29:00.496 --> 29:02.763
It was kind of their place
first. We're the latecomers.

29:02.765 --> 29:03.732
How long does it take to say,

29:03.734 --> 29:06.434
"Leave the gate open,
and let in the rabbits"?

29:06.436 --> 29:09.302
Leave the gate
open, and let in the rabbits.

29:09.304 --> 29:10.404
Ah, I certainly will, madam.

29:10.406 --> 29:12.840
And might I say, those rabbits
are incredibly cute.

29:12.842 --> 29:15.711
Especially the one
with the blue coat. He's my favorite.

29:15.713 --> 29:16.978
And, oh, here's a present.

29:16.980 --> 29:19.449
Wait. Why is she
bringing him a present?

29:19.816 --> 29:21.184
Oh.

29:21.517 --> 29:22.650
How nice of you.

29:22.652 --> 29:24.187
It's for bird-watching.

29:25.420 --> 29:26.422
Thank you.

29:28.492 --> 29:30.524
There's one. It has wings.

29:30.526 --> 29:32.527
Yes, that's a pretty
defining feature

29:32.529 --> 29:34.395
of the bird,
I think you'll find.

29:34.397 --> 29:37.330
You spotted your first bird.
Make sure to mark it down later.

29:37.332 --> 29:38.699
- Mark it down?
- Mmm.

29:38.701 --> 29:42.305
So there's a way of organizing and
documenting the chaos of the sky?

29:42.473 --> 29:43.370
Yes.

29:43.372 --> 29:45.610
Well, it was nice
to meet you, Thomas.

29:45.975 --> 29:47.343
Yes, you, too.

29:48.646 --> 29:51.378
And let's keep this
gate open, shall we,

29:51.380 --> 29:53.446
so the wildlife can run free?

29:53.448 --> 29:55.316
- Absolutely.
- She did it.

29:55.318 --> 29:56.687
We're in. Come on.

30:01.291 --> 30:03.359
Maybe it's not so bad here,
after all.

30:04.794 --> 30:05.796
Ugh.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.367
- No.
- I don't care.

30:13.369 --> 30:15.336
- I'm going in.
- Right behind you.

30:15.338 --> 30:16.570
No. Not a chance.

30:16.572 --> 30:18.473
You remember what happened
to Dad, right?

30:18.475 --> 30:19.808
But you go in all the time.

30:19.810 --> 30:21.075
That's my character flaw.

30:21.077 --> 30:22.677
You get your
own character flaw.

30:22.679 --> 30:24.945
- Come on, Benjamin.
- Why does he get to go?

30:24.947 --> 30:26.881
Yeah, why do I have to go in?

30:26.883 --> 30:28.483
Because that's
his character flaw.

30:28.485 --> 30:31.985
He goes along with everything I say, no
matter how stupid and reckless it is.

30:31.987 --> 30:34.422
No, I don't!
You're not the boss of me!

30:34.424 --> 30:35.724
- Benjamin.
- Coming!

30:35.726 --> 30:38.793
I can't let him go in by himself.
He's being stupid and reckless.

30:40.496 --> 30:42.329
I hope they're
going to be okay.

30:42.331 --> 30:44.465
They'll be fine, and if not,

30:44.467 --> 30:47.502
I guess I'll just be
the new head of the family.

30:47.504 --> 30:50.672
Peter, please be okay!

30:54.578 --> 30:56.677
I'm still
so out of shape.

30:56.679 --> 30:58.847
How's it working with the
putting the dressing on the side?

30:58.849 --> 31:02.587
Good. But I don't understand why it's
healthier to drink it all at once.

31:03.920 --> 31:05.288
Disgusting.

31:05.656 --> 31:06.658
Come on.

31:31.681 --> 31:35.383
What'd I tell ya?
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

31:36.820 --> 31:38.355
- Rats.
- Run!

31:56.438 --> 31:57.908
Hello.

31:59.442 --> 32:01.879
This guy is so much faster
than the old one.

32:03.914 --> 32:04.949
Ah!

32:13.423 --> 32:15.155
Uh-oh. I think
we have a problem.

32:15.157 --> 32:17.626
- What is it?
- Everything's upside down.

32:17.628 --> 32:18.629
Where are you?

32:20.464 --> 32:21.995
We never should
have come in the garden.

32:21.997 --> 32:23.564
No guts, no glory.

32:23.566 --> 32:25.666
Are you ever
scared of anything?

32:25.668 --> 32:27.502
Yeah. Dying alone.

32:27.504 --> 32:29.570
That's why I brought you here.

32:29.572 --> 32:32.509
Do you know what we do
with rats in the city?

32:33.576 --> 32:37.647
We find them,
and we exterminate them.

32:38.948 --> 32:39.983
Ha!

32:41.651 --> 32:42.652
Benjamin.

32:48.524 --> 32:49.560
Ha!

33:01.871 --> 33:03.439
Ha!

33:05.073 --> 33:07.608
- Follow me.
- I can't see anything.

33:07.610 --> 33:10.144
- Follow my voice.
- I can't hear anything!

33:10.146 --> 33:11.212
Follow your heart?

33:11.214 --> 33:12.647
What?

33:13.583 --> 33:14.751
That way, that way, that way.

33:21.757 --> 33:22.759
Play dead.

33:34.003 --> 33:36.136
This is what happens

33:36.138 --> 33:38.973
when you make
a McGregor look foolish

33:38.975 --> 33:40.844
playing carnival games
in the shed.

33:42.978 --> 33:44.278
You see this, everyone?

33:44.280 --> 33:46.818
This is what happens!

33:47.551 --> 33:49.983
Why am I talking to wildlife?

33:49.985 --> 33:51.852
I am losing my mind.

33:51.854 --> 33:54.056
I do... They're not
going to respond.

34:00.996 --> 34:01.997
Come on, come on!

34:07.969 --> 34:08.971
Jump!

34:39.302 --> 34:41.301
Okay, okay.
Flopsy, take the bag,

34:41.303 --> 34:43.672
go to the window
and you put it over his head.

34:43.674 --> 34:44.675
Okay.

34:47.242 --> 34:48.810
Mopsy, you take the bag,

34:48.812 --> 34:50.976
go over to the window,
put it over his head.

34:50.978 --> 34:51.981
Got it.

34:52.179 --> 34:53.551
Oh.

34:54.181 --> 34:55.784
Cotton-Tail, take the bag...

34:57.654 --> 34:59.590
- Just give him a wet willy.
- Got it.

36:13.995 --> 36:14.997
No!

36:19.300 --> 36:20.367
You okay, big guy?

36:20.369 --> 36:22.002
Close one, huh?

36:22.004 --> 36:22.904
I could've been killed.

36:22.906 --> 36:25.710
And not just me.
What if he got the girls?

36:26.374 --> 36:27.944
This isn't a joke, Peter.

36:28.276 --> 36:29.647
I know.

36:30.146 --> 36:31.147
I'm sorry.

36:32.981 --> 36:34.815
You're all right though,
right?

36:34.817 --> 36:36.283
I got your jacket back.

36:36.285 --> 36:37.951
It's not as symbolic as mine.

36:37.953 --> 36:39.285
You know, not being
your dad's and all.

36:39.287 --> 36:42.022
And it's brown, too, which is a
mistake because you're brown.

36:42.024 --> 36:43.757
I mean, brown on brown,
who wears that?

36:43.759 --> 36:45.325
It's a bit matchy-matchy.

36:45.327 --> 36:48.127
Yeah, it's actually
a bit confusing.

36:48.129 --> 36:50.263
Half the time
we think you're naked.

36:50.265 --> 36:51.799
I just look for the buttons.

36:51.801 --> 36:54.167
But then one time,
it was your nipples.

36:54.169 --> 36:55.171
Huh?

36:57.940 --> 37:00.274
Anyway, you got it back,
and you're okay.

37:00.276 --> 37:02.911
No thanks to him. Look at him.

37:02.913 --> 37:05.178
Skinny bag of wet.

37:05.180 --> 37:07.884
Now, turn around
and drive us home, Eugene.

37:08.249 --> 37:09.951
Here's good.

37:09.953 --> 37:12.086
New to the area.
Probably take the next turn.

37:12.088 --> 37:14.120
Just using more fuel.
Not a surprise

37:14.122 --> 37:16.055
that he's not
environmentally friendly.

37:16.057 --> 37:17.926
Hey, we don't
inherit the Earth,

37:17.928 --> 37:20.728
we borrow it
from our children.

37:20.730 --> 37:23.330
I read that on a plastic cup.

37:23.332 --> 37:24.766
If you do a U-turn...

37:24.768 --> 37:26.900
It's actually a safe place
for a U-turn here.

37:26.902 --> 37:27.936
I think that's the...

37:27.938 --> 37:30.471
- Where...
- Where is he taking us?

37:30.473 --> 37:33.307
He's taking us into town.

37:33.309 --> 37:36.944
- So this is London.
- Wow.

37:36.946 --> 37:38.746
Big Ben! Wow!

37:38.748 --> 37:40.082
It's gigantic.

37:40.951 --> 37:42.884
I hope you appreciate this,
Flopsy.

37:42.886 --> 37:45.051
I never got to travel
when I was your age.

37:45.053 --> 37:48.857
What? You were my age,
like, three streets ago.

37:48.859 --> 37:50.225
It goes so fast.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.363
- Huh?
- Whoa.

37:56.365 --> 37:58.064
This must be Harrods.

37:58.066 --> 37:59.870
Wow. Classy.

38:01.471 --> 38:02.503
What can I do for you?

38:02.505 --> 38:04.203
I have a vermin problem.

38:04.205 --> 38:05.507
Rabbits, I'm guessing.

38:05.509 --> 38:07.441
- How do you know that?
- You're the new McGregor.

38:07.443 --> 38:09.343
- Bea's neighbor.
- How do you know that?

38:09.345 --> 38:10.980
- She mentioned you.
- She did?

38:11.514 --> 38:12.514
What did she say?

38:12.516 --> 38:14.281
That you want to sell
your house in a hurry

38:14.283 --> 38:16.884
and use the profits
to open your own toy store,

38:16.886 --> 38:18.151
preferably near Harrods,

38:18.153 --> 38:20.319
so they can witness
their own downfall.

38:20.321 --> 38:23.525
That's incredibly specifically
accurate, and a little disappointing.

38:23.527 --> 38:25.292
Who do you think
these guys are?

38:25.294 --> 38:26.561
They're wearing aprons,

38:26.563 --> 38:28.529
so that could mean
only one thing.

38:28.531 --> 38:29.997
- They're hedgehogs.
- They're hedgehogs.

38:29.999 --> 38:31.399
Hmm.

38:31.401 --> 38:33.332
Just make sure she doesn't find out
you're launching them rabbits.

38:33.334 --> 38:35.135
She loves 'em. Like family.

38:35.137 --> 38:36.938
Read their lips, Mopsy.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.138
If I was a learned fellow,

38:38.140 --> 38:40.439
I'd say she
anthropomorphizes 'em

38:40.441 --> 38:42.877
in lieu of any genuine
human interaction.

38:42.879 --> 38:44.211
But he's not a learned fellow.

38:44.213 --> 38:46.379
Which is why I think she's just
got a thing for those rabbits.

38:46.381 --> 38:49.415
"Which is why I think she's just
got a thing for most man butts."

38:49.417 --> 38:50.485
Huh?

38:50.487 --> 38:51.585
What would you suggest?

38:51.587 --> 38:53.255
An electric fence
will keep 'em out.

38:54.189 --> 38:55.191
To launch 'em,

38:55.957 --> 38:57.156
you'll need some firepower.

38:58.227 --> 39:00.359
Firepower seems like...
I don't want to...

39:00.361 --> 39:01.961
Get down.

39:01.963 --> 39:04.064
That's them! I knew it.

39:04.066 --> 39:06.165
Where are you?
I know you're in there.

39:06.167 --> 39:08.303
Come out! I saw you!

39:12.307 --> 39:14.106
Launch them.
I want to launch them.

39:14.108 --> 39:15.779
Right. Follow me.

39:21.050 --> 39:23.417
It's okay. I've got
11 more ribs.

39:23.419 --> 39:25.318
You actually have
13 on each side.

39:25.320 --> 39:26.287
What?

39:26.289 --> 39:27.922
Which is technically 26
because they go...

39:27.924 --> 39:29.523
Oh, now you're down to 19.

39:29.525 --> 39:31.191
Again, you push this button.

39:31.193 --> 39:34.026
The signal will travel
through the air to this.

39:34.028 --> 39:35.394
This'll start the spark,

39:35.396 --> 39:37.231
and anything
near it will explode.

39:37.233 --> 39:40.202
I do understand the fundamental
concepts of basic things.

39:49.010 --> 39:50.345
It's tricky. A little bit.

39:51.580 --> 39:52.949
Thank you.

39:55.484 --> 39:57.216
Thank you!

39:57.218 --> 39:58.285
Drive safe!

39:59.623 --> 40:00.755
Just match its speed.

40:00.757 --> 40:04.091
Our natural rabbits' pace
should be able to keep up.

40:10.667 --> 40:13.068
Do you know what?
That would never have worked.

40:19.974 --> 40:21.341
Watch it, boxhead!

40:21.343 --> 40:24.144
Leave him alone, babe.
He's just a country bumpkin.

40:24.146 --> 40:25.078
Morons.

40:25.080 --> 40:27.381
"Country bumpkin"?
I'm not a country bumpkin.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.982
I'm from London,
which is where I'd like to...

40:29.984 --> 40:31.421
- Thomas?
- Bea.

40:33.354 --> 40:34.924
- Hello.
- Hello.

40:35.659 --> 40:37.390
- How are you?
- I'm very well. You...

40:37.392 --> 40:38.225
What are you doing here?

40:38.227 --> 40:41.297
Oh, just...
Just picking up some, um,

40:42.330 --> 40:43.196
hardware.

40:43.198 --> 40:44.665
- It's lovely to see you.
- What?

40:44.667 --> 40:46.534
- Can I offer you a lift?
- Why is she here?

40:46.536 --> 40:48.636
Oh, no.
He's stealing her bike.

40:48.638 --> 40:51.370
That's all right. It's more
difficult than I thought it was.

40:51.372 --> 40:54.140
Oh, no. He's stealing her.

40:54.142 --> 40:55.376
Oh, no.

40:55.378 --> 40:58.278
She's going willingly and seems
to be enjoying his company.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.282
Come on, come on.

41:04.621 --> 41:05.989
Come on.

41:12.394 --> 41:15.028
That's a lot of smiling.

41:15.030 --> 41:16.430
More than before, even.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.031
She is showing more teeth.

41:18.033 --> 41:19.432
Must mean she likes him.

41:19.434 --> 41:20.701
Aw.

41:20.703 --> 41:22.169
Not "aw."

41:22.171 --> 41:24.706
She doesn't like him.
She's just really nice.

41:24.708 --> 41:27.207
She smiles at us all the time.

41:27.209 --> 41:28.378
Not like that.

41:37.554 --> 41:38.923
Come in.

41:41.323 --> 41:42.927
Would you like
something to drink?

41:43.325 --> 41:44.327
Yes, please.

41:45.327 --> 41:46.329
Oh.

41:47.162 --> 41:48.394
Are these your paintings?

41:48.396 --> 41:51.164
Oh, that's just
a work in progress.

41:51.166 --> 41:53.369
No, no, this is,
this is beautiful.

41:54.169 --> 41:55.234
Thank you.

41:55.236 --> 41:57.505
What a majestic
mountain range.

41:57.507 --> 41:59.106
It's an old woman in a hat.

41:59.108 --> 42:01.107
Right. Yeah. There's...
There's the hat.

42:01.109 --> 42:02.710
- That's her eyes.
- Yes.

42:02.712 --> 42:04.377
- And that's her chin.
- It's her foot.

42:04.379 --> 42:05.381
That's her foot.

42:06.716 --> 42:09.616
Oh. I'm allergic to
blackberries.

42:09.618 --> 42:11.786
- Oh.
- I'm sorry. My throat closes up.

42:11.788 --> 42:14.321
Allergic to blackberries?

42:14.323 --> 42:16.323
Is that even a thing?
Is that where we've got to?

42:16.325 --> 42:20.160
I mean, everyone's suddenly
allergic to everything.

42:20.162 --> 42:21.361
Stop using it as a crutch!

42:21.363 --> 42:24.430
You know, some people do have
legitimate medical conditions.

42:24.432 --> 42:25.766
Of course, of course.
It's a real struggle

42:25.768 --> 42:27.068
and my heart goes out to them.

42:27.070 --> 42:29.390
It's very tough, very sad. I
don't want to get any letters.

42:29.638 --> 42:31.773
But this guy, come on!

42:31.775 --> 42:33.406
Oh, what about these?

42:33.408 --> 42:35.242
That's just something
I do for fun,

42:35.244 --> 42:37.779
when I'm not focusing
on my real work.

42:37.781 --> 42:39.245
These are beautiful.

42:39.247 --> 42:40.480
You don't have to say that.

42:40.482 --> 42:42.583
I mean, they must be good
if I like them,

42:42.585 --> 42:44.184
given how much I hate rabbits.

42:44.186 --> 42:48.321
I mean, somehow, you managed to make
them look not like the vermin they are.

42:48.323 --> 42:50.625
Vermin? Vermin?

42:50.627 --> 42:52.527
- What does "vermin" mean?
- Like a rodent.

42:52.529 --> 42:55.663
Rodent? Rodent?

42:55.665 --> 42:56.797
What does "rodent" mean?

42:56.799 --> 42:59.131
Like a rat or a mouse.

42:59.133 --> 43:01.403
You think rabbits are vermin?
You're joking, right?

43:02.839 --> 43:05.104
Yes. I'm joking.

43:05.106 --> 43:08.307
'Cause I'm hilarious and
whimsical.

43:08.309 --> 43:11.410
Rabbits are actually
perfect creatures.

43:11.412 --> 43:13.080
They're generous,

43:13.082 --> 43:15.182
honest, pure.

43:15.184 --> 43:16.551
You should see the way
they talk to each other.

43:16.553 --> 43:19.086
They do this incredible thing
when they're apologizing.

43:19.088 --> 43:20.487
- Rabbits apologize?
- Mmm-hmm.

43:20.489 --> 43:23.158
They put their heads
together, like this.

43:24.292 --> 43:25.860
No. No, no, no,
don't apologize to him.

43:25.862 --> 43:27.694
Why is she apologizing to him?

43:27.696 --> 43:30.165
Why is she apologizing to him?

43:32.233 --> 43:34.869
Wow,
that's taking a long time.

43:34.871 --> 43:37.574
She's apologizing
the heck out of that guy.

43:39.207 --> 43:41.842
<i>And this was
only the beginning.</i>

43:41.844 --> 43:45.549
<i>It didn't get any easier for
Peter and the others to stomach.</i>

43:46.148 --> 43:47.451
<i>Or understand.</i>

43:47.717 --> 43:49.085
Anyway.

43:49.719 --> 43:50.851
You'll see.

43:50.853 --> 43:52.419
You'll grow to love them.

43:52.421 --> 43:55.421
<i>But romance
is a powerful thing.</i>

43:55.423 --> 43:57.724
<i>It can sneak up
on any two people.</i>

43:57.726 --> 44:00.227
<i>Even if one is amazing,</i>

44:00.229 --> 44:02.663
<i>and the other is a McGregor.</i>

44:02.665 --> 44:04.465
<i>♪ Girl, I say</i>

44:04.467 --> 44:09.305
<i>♪ If only life would
lean our way</i>

44:10.607 --> 44:14.341
<i>♪ Well, you and me
we'd run away</i>

44:14.343 --> 44:20.147
<i>♪ To be wherever
our adventure awaits</i>

44:21.316 --> 44:24.151
<i>♪ I heard your heart say

44:25.621 --> 44:30.525

<i>♪ I heard your heart say

44:35.430 --> 44:38.632
<i>♪ I heard your heart say

44:38.634 --> 44:41.536
And after my parents
died, I was put in a group home.

44:41.538 --> 44:42.503
Peel.

44:42.505 --> 44:44.704
That must have been awfully
traumatic for you.

44:44.706 --> 44:46.238
Did you deal
with it okay? Peel.

44:46.240 --> 44:48.244
Didn't affect me in the
slightest. Peel.

44:48.844 --> 44:50.412
Yes, I can see that.

44:51.379 --> 44:53.245
Maybe I have some tendencies.

44:53.247 --> 44:55.949
Yeah, to commit rabbit-cide.

44:55.951 --> 44:57.451
- Is that a word?
- No.

44:57.453 --> 45:01.256
Well, I think we all have
our tendencies. Peel.

45:01.658 --> 45:02.790
What are yours?

45:02.792 --> 45:04.423
I guess I don't like people

45:04.425 --> 45:06.627
who aren't who
they say they are.

45:06.629 --> 45:08.194
It's more about me.

45:08.196 --> 45:09.296
I keep saying
I'm a real painter,

45:09.298 --> 45:11.964
yet I can't seem
to finish anything real.

45:11.966 --> 45:13.668
But she paints us.

45:13.670 --> 45:14.802
We're real.

45:14.804 --> 45:16.770
- Aren't we real?
- Ow!

45:16.772 --> 45:18.806
- Yep, definitely real.
- Huh?

45:18.808 --> 45:20.775
What do you miss
most about the store?

45:20.777 --> 45:23.511
And don't say, "Having
everything in its proper place."

45:23.513 --> 45:24.645
I get it.

45:24.647 --> 45:26.314
You have control issues.

45:27.216 --> 45:28.417
I miss being helpful.

45:29.350 --> 45:31.417
A parent or grandparent
comes into the shop

45:31.419 --> 45:34.386
looking for a gift
for the child they love.

45:34.388 --> 45:38.294
I ask a few simple questions, and
know exactly what they need.

45:40.462 --> 45:43.499
I love helping people
get what they want.

45:43.833 --> 45:44.931
You know?

45:44.933 --> 45:47.436
Especially when they don't
even know that they want it.

45:48.303 --> 45:49.438
Those are the best.

45:51.940 --> 45:54.674
Also, neatly arranged displays.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

45:56.979 --> 45:59.714
Yes! Bananas! I win!

45:59.716 --> 46:01.648
Wait, "taradiddle"
isn't a word.

46:01.650 --> 46:03.984
Yes, it is. It means "fib,"
"pretentious nonsense."

46:03.986 --> 46:08.688
That is exactly the sort of definition
you'd make up for a made-up word.

46:08.690 --> 46:12.596
Mr. McGregor, are you accusing
me of taradiddling?

46:13.696 --> 46:18.598

Oh, no. Damn it.

46:44.627 --> 46:45.762
- Huh?
- Huh.

46:50.600 --> 46:52.469
- Closed.
- Pull up a chair.

46:52.902 --> 46:54.735
We're wearing fur.

46:54.737 --> 46:56.737
- Thank you.
- You're drenched. Sit down.

46:56.739 --> 46:58.370
Let me help you dry off.

46:58.372 --> 46:59.509
Thank you very much.

47:15.090 --> 47:17.828
I could stay here forever.

47:19.462 --> 47:20.527
Hiya.

47:21.997 --> 47:23.630
Hello.

47:23.632 --> 47:25.964
Haven't seen you
in the longest time.

47:25.966 --> 47:27.935
Meet my new friend, Thomas.

47:27.937 --> 47:30.674
- Would you like to have a hold?
- Among other things.

47:33.008 --> 47:34.909
Oh, look.

47:34.911 --> 47:38.345
My two boys
getting along perfectly.

47:38.347 --> 47:40.815
Nothing could make me happier.

47:40.817 --> 47:42.482
Do you mind if I paint this?

47:42.484 --> 47:44.951
Nothing would make me happier.

47:51.093 --> 47:53.761
You're mine now, rabbit.

48:08.844 --> 48:12.880
Thomas, are your eyes emerald
or sea-foam green?

48:12.882 --> 48:15.414
Uh, sea-foam green with a hint
of battleship gray.

48:15.416 --> 48:16.585
I thought so.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.592
Thomas?

48:25.594 --> 48:28.961
And that's what separates us
from the French.

48:28.963 --> 48:30.864
Yup. Kiwi green.

48:30.866 --> 48:32.334
You're the professional.

48:35.571 --> 48:36.770
Yay.

48:36.772 --> 48:37.774
Ooh.

48:38.908 --> 48:39.909
Yay.

48:40.643 --> 48:41.645
Ooh.

48:41.944 --> 48:43.710
Yay. Ooh.

48:43.712 --> 48:44.944
Yay. Ooh.

48:44.946 --> 48:47.349
Yay. Ooh.

48:47.884 --> 48:48.949
Yay.

48:48.951 --> 48:52.585
No, no, no, it's an old woman
in a hat, you see?

48:52.587 --> 48:53.887
Huh.

48:53.889 --> 48:56.759
I just assumed she would've
reentered at that exact moment.

48:58.828 --> 48:59.830
Ow.

49:10.705 --> 49:12.071
You need to stop.

49:12.073 --> 49:13.643
It's not going to end well.

49:14.142 --> 49:15.645
I think I found it.

49:17.044 --> 49:18.414
The perfect ma...

49:19.046 --> 49:20.549
My painting!

49:28.055 --> 49:29.321
It's ruined.

49:29.323 --> 49:32.191
Oh, you know how uncontrollable
wildlife can be. I just...

49:32.193 --> 49:34.160
- Bad rabbit. Bad rabbit!
- Yes, bad rabbit.

49:34.162 --> 49:35.529
- Naughty.
- Bad rabbit!

49:35.531 --> 49:36.963
- Out, get out.
- Out.

49:36.965 --> 49:39.064
I said, shoo. Shoo!

49:39.066 --> 49:40.436
Get out of here!

49:41.202 --> 49:43.970
I'm so sorry.
He just went mad.

49:43.972 --> 49:44.974
Are you all right?

49:50.813 --> 49:51.948
He's gotta go.

49:53.013 --> 49:54.147
No way!

49:54.149 --> 49:56.216
The sun came up again!

49:56.218 --> 49:58.552
If I knew this was
gonna keep happening,

49:58.554 --> 50:00.721
certainly wouldn't have
fertilized all those eggs!

50:00.723 --> 50:03.590
Now I have to stick around
till they hatch!

50:03.592 --> 50:07.663
And be present and involved!

50:09.531 --> 50:10.764

50:10.766 --> 50:15.569

50:17.972 --> 50:21.574
Why you kids walking so slow?

50:21.576 --> 50:24.077

50:59.280 --> 51:00.648
You can do this, Flops.

51:00.650 --> 51:02.683
Take a deep breath,
pull it back,

51:02.685 --> 51:06.285
and picture the one face you'd
most like to see get hit.

51:06.287 --> 51:08.755
Ooh. Got someone.

51:10.124 --> 51:11.928
Sorry!

51:16.196 --> 51:17.567

52:09.184 --> 52:10.884
He's got to go.

52:10.886 --> 52:13.318
His face was so
classic. He was like...

52:15.090 --> 52:16.356
All of the rakes. I mean,

52:16.358 --> 52:18.223
I didn't even think
it would work that well.

52:18.225 --> 52:20.959
It was right on the edge
of believability.

52:20.961 --> 52:22.028
You guys.

52:22.030 --> 52:24.330
How did you even get that
wheelbarrow up there?

52:25.900 --> 52:28.334
It was a perfectly crafted
sequence.

52:28.336 --> 52:29.234
Now listen.

52:29.236 --> 52:31.704
We've got him
just where we want him.

52:31.706 --> 52:33.840
It's on to the next phase.

52:33.842 --> 52:35.645
- Uh, that might not be possible.
- Hmm?

52:45.220 --> 52:47.591
That's a serious
electric fence.

52:48.757 --> 52:50.891
Why is he feeding it
peanut butter?

52:50.893 --> 52:51.957
Yummy.

52:51.959 --> 52:53.862
He's trying to bait us
into touching it.

52:55.030 --> 52:57.030
What happens if we touch it?

52:57.032 --> 52:58.964
We're about to find out.

53:00.001 --> 53:02.670
No, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle!
Stop! No.

53:02.672 --> 53:04.938
I'm four and a half years old.

53:04.940 --> 53:07.708
I need some excitement
before I check out.

53:07.710 --> 53:09.710
- Don't do it!
- No, Tiggy-Winkle, stop!

53:09.712 --> 53:11.673
Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle,
it's not worth it!

53:22.157 --> 53:23.158
Look away.

53:24.460 --> 53:26.024
Guys, I have an idea.

53:26.026 --> 53:28.026
You remember what
Dad used to say to us?

53:28.028 --> 53:31.898
"Never go into
McGregor's garden."

53:31.900 --> 53:33.933
Yeah, but what else
did he say to us?

53:33.935 --> 53:36.435
Don't electrify
a lady hedgehog.

53:36.437 --> 53:40.039
Maybe we should rethink some of
the other stuff Dad said to us.

53:40.041 --> 53:43.911
Oh, yeah, like, "You can't
put lipstick on a pig."

53:43.913 --> 53:46.245
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- This is lip balm.

53:46.247 --> 53:49.182
It's cherry flavor, so it
might appear to be lipstick,

53:49.184 --> 53:50.920
but this is lip balm.

53:53.153 --> 53:55.788
Yes, yes, yes.
Okay, he also used to say,

53:55.790 --> 53:57.790
"You can't out-clever a fox,

53:57.792 --> 54:00.059
"so use his cleverness against him."

54:00.061 --> 54:02.799
Oh, come on, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle!
That's enough!

54:13.942 --> 54:14.976
Oh.

54:16.276 --> 54:17.680
Two-winged

54:17.979 --> 54:19.013

54:19.414 --> 54:20.784

54:25.520 --> 54:28.053

54:33.895 --> 54:34.828

54:34.830 --> 54:36.261

54:46.374 --> 54:47.907

54:47.909 --> 54:49.341

56:08.222 --> 56:09.291
Let me just check.

56:11.860 --> 56:12.992
Yeah, I felt brain.

56:12.994 --> 56:15.327
Now, if history is any
indication,

56:15.329 --> 56:18.330
that ice cream truck with the
lights'll take him away.

56:18.332 --> 56:19.334
Sorry.

56:51.399 --> 56:54.403

Explosives.

56:56.505 --> 56:57.874
Hide. Quick.

56:58.405 --> 56:59.407
Follow me.

57:02.745 --> 57:05.977
You push this, signal goes
through the air, towards this,

57:05.979 --> 57:08.082
and everything in there goes...

57:11.352 --> 57:13.021
Good-bye, rabbits.

57:14.254 --> 57:15.554
Rabbits?

57:15.556 --> 57:17.024
Hello? Rabbits?

57:17.692 --> 57:19.260
- Rabbits?
- Thomas?

57:20.028 --> 57:21.096
Yeah?

57:22.097 --> 57:24.263
What are you doing
out in the garden so late?

57:24.265 --> 57:25.267
Uh...

57:26.401 --> 57:28.534
I'm picking wildflowers.

57:30.972 --> 57:32.605
It's for you.

57:32.607 --> 57:34.140
He's come back to life.

57:34.142 --> 57:35.676
With a light on his head.

57:35.678 --> 57:37.111
He's evolving.

57:38.245 --> 57:40.282
What were you doing
out in the garden?

57:41.149 --> 57:42.013
Doing?

57:42.015 --> 57:43.251
Yeah. By the tree.

57:44.151 --> 57:46.218
"Doing" can mean
so many things, can't it?

57:46.220 --> 57:48.287
- I mean, I was, I was...
- Would you mind?

57:48.289 --> 57:50.556
- It's just awfully bright.
- I was do... Is it?

57:50.558 --> 57:53.225
Is it distracting you from what
you were asking me just then?

57:53.227 --> 57:54.126
Is it better down?

57:54.128 --> 57:56.198
Up. Up. It's quite bright.

57:56.997 --> 57:59.397
And so we advance to endgame.

57:59.399 --> 58:01.066
You sure you know
what you're doing?

58:01.068 --> 58:03.301
What? We're tryin' to get
our garden back.

58:03.303 --> 58:05.037
Is that really
what this is all about?

58:05.039 --> 58:06.104
Of course,
that's what it's about.

58:06.106 --> 58:08.507
You think I've got some
kind of ulterior motive,

58:08.509 --> 58:12.278
that I'm harboring some kind of
emotional connection to her,

58:12.280 --> 58:14.280
because of losing
my own mother and father

58:14.282 --> 58:16.247
and I think if she goes,
what have I got?

58:16.249 --> 58:17.316
It's only about the garden,

58:17.318 --> 58:19.719
and I don't know what's
happened to my voice. It...

58:19.721 --> 58:21.386
It shouldn't be this high.

58:21.388 --> 58:22.556
It should be lower.

58:22.558 --> 58:24.156
It should be lower.

58:24.158 --> 58:26.493
I love her like a mother.

58:26.495 --> 58:28.193
Yes, that was very convincing.

58:28.195 --> 58:30.196
It's only about the garden.

58:30.198 --> 58:31.097
Yes, it is.

58:31.099 --> 58:32.365
I'm stuck. My voice is stuck.

58:32.367 --> 58:33.848
- Cotton-Tail, can you just...
- Yeah.

58:34.737 --> 58:36.297
Thank you. Let's do this.

58:37.171 --> 58:38.373
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

58:42.478 --> 58:45.044
I'm not sure I want to be
part of this anymore.

58:45.046 --> 58:46.278
Of course, you do.

58:46.280 --> 58:48.381
Just do what I say.
It will all work out.

58:48.383 --> 58:49.482
"Like always, huh?"

58:49.484 --> 58:52.451
Said the rabbit who almost
got thrown into a river.

58:52.453 --> 58:53.455
Trust me.

58:56.323 --> 58:57.325
I got this.

59:17.278 --> 59:18.545
Cotton-Tail, go.

59:27.455 --> 59:28.457
Hello?

59:30.224 --> 59:32.759
Ready. Aim. Hold it.

59:32.761 --> 59:34.694
Hold it.

59:34.696 --> 59:36.127
- Thomas.
- Fire!

59:37.533 --> 59:40.500
- Morning.
- You fancy a spot of lunch later?

59:40.502 --> 59:41.601
Uh...

59:41.603 --> 59:44.102
Yes. That...
Lunch would be lovely.

59:44.104 --> 59:45.672
I was thinking of
making a salad.

59:45.674 --> 59:46.840
Oh, yeah.

59:46.842 --> 59:48.544
Or maybe a soup.
What would you prefer?

59:49.309 --> 59:50.677
Ow.

59:50.679 --> 59:52.144
Let me think. Soup. Soup.

59:52.146 --> 59:54.614
Would you like water,
or sparkling water, or...

59:54.616 --> 59:57.119
Would you just
pick one, please?

59:59.153 --> 01:00:01.755
Look at you, you're doing
your relaxation pose.

01:00:01.757 --> 01:00:03.857
- Arms up.
- Yeah. What?

01:00:03.859 --> 01:00:06.292
- Arms up.
- Really? Up?

01:00:06.294 --> 01:00:08.527
- Yep, up they go.
- You know where to aim.

01:00:08.529 --> 01:00:09.531
All right.

01:00:15.169 --> 01:00:17.636
- You look really relaxed.
- So relaxed.

01:00:17.638 --> 01:00:19.104
Just going to
do some painting.

01:00:19.106 --> 01:00:20.305
Blackberries. Blackberries!

01:00:20.307 --> 01:00:23.311
No, but he's allergic to...
Ah! Clever.

01:00:23.846 --> 01:00:26.178
Shoot for the mouth.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.715
I might put some music on.
I hope it's not too loud.

01:00:28.717 --> 01:00:30.448
Get in there and create!

01:00:30.451 --> 01:00:32.118
I'm out.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.487
- Flopsy.
- Visualize the face.

01:00:33.489 --> 01:00:35.589
Look at my face.
Turn his face into my face.

01:00:35.591 --> 01:00:37.723
Now stop looking at my face
and look at his face,

01:00:37.725 --> 01:00:39.461
but see my face, and fire!

01:00:39.895 --> 01:00:41.494
- Yes!
- Flopsy!

01:00:43.131 --> 01:00:44.399
Blackberries.

01:00:52.841 --> 01:00:54.209
Ooh.

01:01:01.414 --> 01:01:02.416
That should do it.

01:01:03.819 --> 01:01:04.717
What?

01:01:04.719 --> 01:01:06.753

some kind of sorcerer.

That's it.

01:01:24.238 --> 01:01:26.238
This is starting to
get out of control.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.607
No, no, this is perfect.

01:01:27.609 --> 01:01:28.775
Remember your training.

01:01:28.777 --> 01:01:30.445
Wait, did we train for this?

01:01:33.781 --> 01:01:35.382
Whoa!

01:01:42.623 --> 01:01:44.390
How is this perfect?

01:01:44.392 --> 01:01:46.357

- I'm hit.
- Mopsy!

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:02.541
No!

01:02:06.581 --> 01:02:09.281
Flopsy, I need you
to know something.

01:02:09.283 --> 01:02:10.549
I'm not the oldest.

01:02:10.551 --> 01:02:13.786
- What?
- You were always so cute and lovable.

01:02:13.788 --> 01:02:15.721
And Cotton-Tail,
well, she's...

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:21.462
Cotton-Tail,

01:02:21.464 --> 01:02:24.563
so Mum and Dad told us
I was the oldest,

01:02:24.565 --> 01:02:25.964
so I had something.

01:02:25.966 --> 01:02:28.300
But, really,
you're the oldest,

01:02:28.302 --> 01:02:30.569
and I'm nothing.

01:02:30.571 --> 01:02:32.641
No! Mopsy, don't go.

01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:34.708
Mopsy?

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.949
Hmm? It was just a tomato.
I'm fine.

01:02:42.951 --> 01:02:44.817
Guys, I'm fine!

01:02:44.819 --> 01:02:46.952
It's just a tomato!

01:02:46.954 --> 01:02:49.489
Hey, you never heard
any of that stuff, got me?

01:02:49.491 --> 01:02:50.525
Hmm.

01:02:51.659 --> 01:02:52.791
Dink.

01:03:10.478 --> 01:03:11.878
<i>♪ Fight left in me ♪</i>

01:03:14.015 --> 01:03:16.318
Gotcha! You listen to me.

01:03:16.784 --> 01:03:19.017
I am not a bad guy.

01:03:19.019 --> 01:03:20.619
You turned me into this.

01:03:20.621 --> 01:03:22.454
I am a nice person.

01:03:22.456 --> 01:03:24.690
I've chilled out, man.

01:03:24.692 --> 01:03:26.024
I'm cool now.

01:03:26.026 --> 01:03:29.695
I've evolved, but you,
you're still the same.

01:03:29.697 --> 01:03:31.697
Still full of mischief.

01:03:31.699 --> 01:03:35.434
And that's why things are not
going to end well for you.

01:03:35.436 --> 01:03:39.471
Because you poked at me
and you poked at me,

01:03:39.473 --> 01:03:42.775
until all that's left
for me to do is wring your...

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:43.877
What's going on here?

01:03:43.879 --> 01:03:45.977
You've got to chew your food!

01:03:45.979 --> 01:03:47.714
I saved him.

01:03:47.716 --> 01:03:49.013
What happened? Is he okay?

01:03:49.015 --> 01:03:50.115
Yeah, I... He...

01:03:50.117 --> 01:03:52.619
The poor little guy,
he was choking on some radish.

01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:54.654
So I just...
I've checked his pulse,

01:03:54.656 --> 01:03:56.421
and everything's
gonna be okay.

01:03:56.423 --> 01:03:58.724
You're going to be okay!

01:03:58.726 --> 01:04:01.895
So off you go. Off you go.
There we are.

01:04:03.931 --> 01:04:05.266
It's a miracle.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.397
Yeah.

01:04:06.399 --> 01:04:08.835
I thought I heard
some loud noises.

01:04:08.837 --> 01:04:09.869
It was a bit of a ruckus.

01:04:09.871 --> 01:04:12.071
I was painting, so I can't
be sure, but did you...

01:04:12.073 --> 01:04:14.641
No, I don't think so...
I was weeding.

01:04:14.643 --> 01:04:17.944
I do make grunting noises when
I weed sometimes.

01:04:17.946 --> 01:04:20.913
It's just people have used explosives
before to keep the rabbits out.

01:04:20.915 --> 01:04:21.947
Explosives?

01:04:21.949 --> 01:04:23.015
But you wouldn't do that.

01:04:23.017 --> 01:04:24.082
I wouldn't do
something like that.

01:04:24.084 --> 01:04:25.485
- No, of course not.
- They're angels.

01:04:25.487 --> 01:04:26.619
This is their place
as much as ours.

01:04:26.621 --> 01:04:28.587
- Yeah, exactly.
- Learned that from you.

01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:30.988
I just thought I heard
something.

01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:33.460
Is that a two-winged
flying bird up there?

01:04:33.462 --> 01:04:34.828
- I must mark it down.
- Where?

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.428
- Up there.
- She believes him.

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:37.963
We'll never
get rid of him now.

01:04:37.965 --> 01:04:39.632
I don't think so.

01:04:39.634 --> 01:04:42.705
Up there. Just in
that... In the faraway tree.

01:04:47.475 --> 01:04:49.477
You are using explosives.

01:04:50.144 --> 01:04:51.610
You lied to me.

01:04:51.612 --> 01:04:52.915
Well, yes, but...

01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:18.741
Oh!

01:05:21.975 --> 01:05:23.142
Oh...

01:05:23.144 --> 01:05:24.480
My house.

01:05:25.012 --> 01:05:26.347
My paintings.

01:05:28.817 --> 01:05:29.819
Their burrow.

01:05:32.453 --> 01:05:34.456
This is going to be difficult
for you to hear,

01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:36.759
but he did it.

01:05:37.091 --> 01:05:38.494
He detonated it.

01:05:39.994 --> 01:05:41.363
He's a rabbit.

01:05:41.763 --> 01:05:42.764
I know.

01:05:43.164 --> 01:05:44.630
But somehow,

01:05:44.632 --> 01:05:47.401
he found the detonator,
and he took his paw...

01:05:48.202 --> 01:05:50.503
And he did all that
to come between us.

01:05:50.505 --> 01:05:52.069
He's a rabbit!

01:05:52.071 --> 01:05:53.773
All right. Okay.
Let's be reasonable.

01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:55.741
For a start, you know
they rob from the garden.

01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:58.811
Did you know
they set traps in my bed?

01:05:58.813 --> 01:06:01.180
So when I woke up,
I hurt my little fingers!

01:06:01.182 --> 01:06:03.147
And then they used
electricity against me,

01:06:03.149 --> 01:06:04.283
which we invented,

01:06:04.285 --> 01:06:07.218
but they modified for
their own nefarious purposes!

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.855
And they saw the Bananagrams,

01:06:08.857 --> 01:06:11.590
they saw the bicycle ride,
they saw the walk in the park.

01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:13.759
And where did they get
the jackets? We don't know!

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:15.527
But they've
been there all along.

01:06:15.529 --> 01:06:17.663
You're a crazy person.

01:06:17.665 --> 01:06:19.834
I can't believe
I thought I liked you.

01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:21.803
You do like me.

01:06:24.204 --> 01:06:25.774
And I like you. That's...

01:06:26.974 --> 01:06:28.942
Are you okay, sweeties?

01:06:28.944 --> 01:06:29.945
I'm sorry.

01:06:32.781 --> 01:06:33.779
Come on.

01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:36.451
Let's get away
from this evil man.

01:06:43.957 --> 01:06:44.990
I'm sorry.

01:06:44.992 --> 01:06:47.428
Yes, so am I.

01:07:02.777 --> 01:07:05.142
Another day?
I can't believe it!

01:07:05.144 --> 01:07:06.712
This is so exciting!

01:07:06.714 --> 01:07:07.880
I know, right?

01:07:07.882 --> 01:07:09.581
Can you believe it?

01:07:09.583 --> 01:07:12.552
Although, things aren't going
so great now,

01:07:12.554 --> 01:07:14.857
so maybe last night
should've been it!

I'm so sorry about your home.

01:07:49.323 --> 01:07:52.791
It's all my fault. I should never
have invited him into our lives.

01:07:52.793 --> 01:07:55.561
He's such an idiot,
and going after you like that

01:07:55.563 --> 01:07:57.829

nothing to goad him.

You're just going

01:08:00.267 --> 01:08:01.637
a complete innocent.

01:08:05.806 --> 01:08:09.109
Sad truth is, though, I
actually kind of fell for him.

01:08:10.578 --> 01:08:12.514
I could have loved him, even.

less after we had the girls?

01:09:38.298 --> 01:09:39.964
I've been trying to call you.

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:42.167
I'm sorry, there's
no reception in Windermere.

01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:43.368
How barbaric.

01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:46.270
On the contrary,
it's one of its many beauties.

01:09:46.272 --> 01:09:47.673
I have some good news.

01:09:47.675 --> 01:09:49.408
Bannerman's no longer with us.

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:53.412
- He died.
- Earring infection in both ears.

01:09:53.413 --> 01:09:56.749
Said it was the stress
of working here for one day.

01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:59.718
Quit, moved to France,
of course.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.821
- I'm sorry, is he dead?
- No.

01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:04.355
I thought maybe "moving
to France" was a euphemism.

01:10:04.357 --> 01:10:06.357

01:10:10.363 --> 01:10:12.329
Interested?

01:10:12.331 --> 01:10:13.732
Where would I find
men's scarves?

01:10:13.734 --> 01:10:14.767
- Lower ground.
- Lower ground.

01:10:14.769 --> 01:10:16.902
Just take the escalator down.
Right, right, left.

01:10:16.904 --> 01:10:19.104
With your hip-to-waist ratio,
I'd suggest a green check.

01:10:19.439 --> 01:10:20.809
You work here?

01:10:21.075 --> 01:10:22.076
Do you?

01:10:23.109 --> 01:10:24.443
Do you?

01:10:24.445 --> 01:10:25.580
I'm thinking.

01:10:29.451 --> 01:10:30.819
- Do you?
- I...

01:10:35.823 --> 01:10:37.258
I'm gonna go make this right.

01:10:38.258 --> 01:10:39.791
I've wrecked our home.

01:10:39.793 --> 01:10:41.258
I've wrecked Bea's home.

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:43.160
I'm a real home-wrecker.

01:10:43.162 --> 01:10:45.764
Think I'm using
that expression properly.

01:10:45.766 --> 01:10:47.332
I got us into this,

01:10:47.334 --> 01:10:49.167
and I let you all down.

01:10:49.169 --> 01:10:50.204
I'm really sorry.

01:10:51.071 --> 01:10:53.174
I prepared a speech.

01:10:54.273 --> 01:10:55.807
"I got us into this,

01:10:55.809 --> 01:10:57.208
"and I let you all down.

01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:58.211
"I'm really sorry."

01:10:59.379 --> 01:11:01.947
I guess that was
the whole thing.

01:11:01.949 --> 01:11:03.782
Kind of crushed it
the first time.

01:11:08.956 --> 01:11:10.822
I should've listened
to you, Benjamin.

01:11:10.824 --> 01:11:13.357
Not just about this,
about everything.

01:11:13.359 --> 01:11:14.959
You're so much wiser than me.

01:11:14.961 --> 01:11:16.764
It wasn't about the garden.

01:11:17.532 --> 01:11:19.230
I don't know where
I'd be without you.

01:11:19.232 --> 01:11:20.702
In a pie, probably.

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.834
Probably.

01:11:22.836 --> 01:11:24.839
And I should've been
a better big brother.

01:11:26.507 --> 01:11:27.972
Truth is,

01:11:27.974 --> 01:11:29.977
I'm a little lost
without Mum and Dad.

01:11:30.845 --> 01:11:32.477
I miss them so much.

01:11:32.479 --> 01:11:34.245
- So do we.
- Yeah.

01:11:34.247 --> 01:11:35.249
Me, too.

01:11:46.493 --> 01:11:48.360
So, are we good?

01:11:48.362 --> 01:11:49.865
This was pretty bad,

01:11:50.296 --> 01:11:51.733
even for you.

01:11:58.138 --> 01:11:59.340
I'm scared, Peter.

01:12:00.374 --> 01:12:02.541
Don't be. I'm gonna fix this.

01:12:02.543 --> 01:12:03.975
- What should we do?
- Just make sure

01:12:03.977 --> 01:12:05.812
she doesn't leave
until I get back.

01:12:05.814 --> 01:12:08.082
Should we break
both ankles or just one?

01:12:09.982 --> 01:12:11.853
I'm sorry, that was weird.

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:13.418
- Both.
- What?

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:15.855
Just stall her.
I won't let you down.

01:12:15.857 --> 01:12:17.926
- I promise.
- You can count on us.

01:12:19.527 --> 01:12:21.459
Also, I didn't kill
old McGregor.

01:12:21.461 --> 01:12:23.294
He died of a heart attack.

01:12:23.296 --> 01:12:24.962
- We know.
- The whole time.

01:12:24.964 --> 01:12:27.298
- We thought you needed a victory.
- Okay, then.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.868
<i>Laser-focused</i>

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:31.035
<i>with a half thought-out plan,</i>

01:12:31.037 --> 01:12:33.606
<i>this is what
a hero looks like.</i>

01:12:33.608 --> 01:12:36.141
<i>Or a lunatic.</i>

01:12:36.143 --> 01:12:38.847
<i>The line between the two
is very blurry.</i>

01:12:40.112 --> 01:12:42.548
Okay, listen up.
Here's what we're going to do.

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:43.981
Wait, why do you
get to be in charge?

01:12:43.983 --> 01:12:45.249
Because I'm the oldest.

01:12:45.251 --> 01:12:47.319
- By 16 seconds.
- Ugh.

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:50.355
Oh, Mopsy. Sweet, sweet Mopsy.

01:12:50.357 --> 01:12:53.459
Wait, you both know
that I'm the oldest, right?

01:12:53.461 --> 01:12:54.560
Huh?

01:12:54.562 --> 01:12:56.360

Oops, sorry.

01:13:00.934 --> 01:13:04.069
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

01:13:04.071 --> 01:13:07.071

01:13:07.073 --> 01:13:09.042
Sorry. Sorry.
Oh, no, it's leaving.

01:13:11.143 --> 01:13:12.477
Wait for me!

01:13:12.479 --> 01:13:13.946
Benjamin!

01:13:13.948 --> 01:13:15.046
You're coming with me?

01:13:15.048 --> 01:13:18.950
Yes, it's my character flaw.

01:13:18.952 --> 01:13:20.985
But there's no other character

01:13:20.987 --> 01:13:24.388
I'd rather have
a flaw for than you...

01:13:26.058 --> 01:13:27.493
I'm so glad you came.

01:13:27.495 --> 01:13:29.327
I feel terrible
that I hurt you.

01:13:29.329 --> 01:13:30.995
I prepared a speech.

01:13:30.997 --> 01:13:32.364
"I feel terrible that..."

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:33.397
Benjamin!

01:13:33.399 --> 01:13:35.468
No! Benjamin, I'm sorry!

01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:37.669
Run! Run, jump! You can do it!

01:13:37.671 --> 01:13:38.970
You can... Yes!

01:13:38.972 --> 01:13:41.175
Peter, you're a terrible
apologizer.

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:55.655
Excuse me, town mouse, do you
know how to get to Harrods?

01:13:55.657 --> 01:13:57.388
Absolutely.

01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:58.957
Are you boys from the country?

01:13:58.959 --> 01:13:59.858
How can you tell?

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.293
Brown on brown.
It's a bit matchy-matchy.

01:14:02.295 --> 01:14:03.294
Mmm-hmm.

01:14:03.296 --> 01:14:05.163
Come with me, I'll give you
the grand tour.

01:14:05.165 --> 01:14:06.964
Thanks.
We're kind of in a hurry.

01:14:06.966 --> 01:14:08.366
Plenty to see
along the way.

01:14:08.702 --> 01:14:10.334
Tower Bridge.

01:14:10.336 --> 01:14:11.704
Buckingham Palace.

01:14:11.706 --> 01:14:13.404
Guards wearing beavers.

01:14:13.406 --> 01:14:14.507
Big Ben.

01:14:14.509 --> 01:14:16.207
Much larger than I thought.

01:14:16.209 --> 01:14:17.543
View of the skyline.

01:14:17.545 --> 01:14:19.712
It's just stunning,
but, Johnny,

01:14:19.714 --> 01:14:21.980
we're on a time-sensitive
mission,

01:14:21.982 --> 01:14:24.015
and it seems like
you're drawing it out a bit

01:14:24.017 --> 01:14:25.685
because of pride
for your hometown.

01:14:25.687 --> 01:14:29.354
London's one of the most culturally
significant cities in the world.

01:14:29.356 --> 01:14:31.691
What kind of host would I be
if I didn't share it with you?

01:14:31.693 --> 01:14:35.329
You're right, if we're actually
here, we should see everything.

01:14:38.165 --> 01:14:39.330
Thanks, Johnny,
we owe you one.

01:14:39.332 --> 01:14:43.168
My pleasure. Always happy
to help out a fellow rodent.

01:14:44.604 --> 01:14:45.972
Rodent?

01:14:49.676 --> 01:14:52.077
It's a shame.

01:14:52.079 --> 01:14:54.917
But don't worry, I'll get you
to the train on time.

01:15:09.329 --> 01:15:10.331
Yes!

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.567
Who would
do such a thing?

01:15:15.569 --> 01:15:17.037
I have many enemies.

01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:20.307
Okay, he's got to be here.

01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:26.446
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?

01:15:27.214 --> 01:15:30.080
A talking bunny doll?

01:15:30.082 --> 01:15:32.618
I am a rabbit.

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.322
I like carrots.

01:15:35.054 --> 01:15:36.491
Beep-boop, beep...

01:15:44.564 --> 01:15:46.699
This isn't happening.
He's just an illusion.

01:15:46.701 --> 01:15:49.602
Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

01:15:49.604 --> 01:15:51.603
Mr. McGregor. Psst.

01:15:51.605 --> 01:15:53.307
Remember me from before?

01:15:54.608 --> 01:15:56.575
No, no, no, no!
I just want to talk.

01:15:56.577 --> 01:15:58.109
I just want to talk.

01:15:58.111 --> 01:16:01.746
Rabbits don't talk!
I knew you could talk!

01:16:01.748 --> 01:16:04.553
Wait, are you talking
or am I just hallucinating?

01:16:06.385 --> 01:16:08.721
Call Security. He's gone
crackers again.

01:16:08.723 --> 01:16:10.992
You ruined my life!

01:16:14.094 --> 01:16:15.126
McGregor!

01:16:15.128 --> 01:16:16.598
You got to come back with us.

01:16:17.832 --> 01:16:20.131
Back to Bea.
She's about to leave.

01:16:20.133 --> 01:16:22.167
She's gonna give up painting
and go home.

01:16:22.169 --> 01:16:23.535
She wants nothing
to do with me.

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:25.670
That's because she thinks
this is all your fault.

01:16:25.672 --> 01:16:29.541
But we both know that I had a little
tiny something to do with it.

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:30.810
"Little"?

01:16:30.812 --> 01:16:32.511
- "Tiny"?
- Okay, a lot.

01:16:32.513 --> 01:16:34.547
I'm not good at owning up
to my mistakes.

01:16:34.549 --> 01:16:36.280
I'm working on it.

01:16:36.282 --> 01:16:39.019
- McGregor!
- I just hope it's not too late.

01:16:39.687 --> 01:16:40.852
I let her down.

01:16:40.854 --> 01:16:42.419
It's over.

01:16:42.421 --> 01:16:43.556
It's not.

01:16:43.558 --> 01:16:44.824
I just wanted you gone.

01:16:44.826 --> 01:16:46.659
I didn't think of
anyone but myself.

01:16:46.661 --> 01:16:48.293
I'm sorry I electrocuted you.

01:16:48.295 --> 01:16:49.829
I'm sorry I put
traps on your head.

01:16:49.831 --> 01:16:51.797
I'm sorry I rubbed my butt
on your hairbrush.

01:16:51.799 --> 01:16:53.598
Wait. Wait. What?

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.335
Nothing. Stay focused.

01:16:56.571 --> 01:16:58.504
Please come back. Not for me.

01:16:58.506 --> 01:17:01.175
- For Bea.
- How do I know this isn't a trick?

01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:03.741
You don't.

01:17:03.743 --> 01:17:05.379
You just have to trust me.

01:17:06.278 --> 01:17:07.482
Trust us.

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:10.316
So you really are
talking?

01:17:10.818 --> 01:17:13.150
No. Like you said,

01:17:13.152 --> 01:17:15.855
you chilled out, man.
You're cool now.

01:17:15.857 --> 01:17:17.455
And you're listening
to your heart.

01:17:17.457 --> 01:17:18.723
That's what you're hearing.

01:17:18.725 --> 01:17:20.692
McGregor!
Unlock this door!

01:17:20.694 --> 01:17:21.727
Now listen to your heart.

01:17:21.729 --> 01:17:22.727
It's telling you to turn left,

01:17:22.729 --> 01:17:24.496
run six paces to that window,
break it open,

01:17:24.498 --> 01:17:26.501
and let's get the
heck out of here!

01:17:28.201 --> 01:17:30.271
McGregor! Open up!

01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:37.077
McGregor!

01:17:45.853 --> 01:17:48.352
<i>And so the two
former enemies</i>

01:17:48.354 --> 01:17:51.355
<i>and one of their cousins
set out across the country,</i>

01:17:51.357 --> 01:17:53.592
<i>a ticking clock
their common adversary.</i>

01:17:53.594 --> 01:17:56.360
<i>It was dangerous, gutsy,
convoluted,</i>

01:17:56.362 --> 01:17:58.195
<i>and, in a story like this,</i>

01:17:58.197 --> 01:18:00.900
<i>pretty much a journey
guaranteed to succeed.</i>

01:18:00.902 --> 01:18:03.104
<i>So let's just
hit the highlights.</i>

01:18:10.242 --> 01:18:11.810
Everybody, hang on!

01:18:21.656 --> 01:18:22.855
Now!

01:18:22.857 --> 01:18:24.390
Huh?

01:18:27.562 --> 01:18:29.527
Headlights.

01:18:29.529 --> 01:18:30.696
What?

01:18:30.698 --> 01:18:31.931
They're not even on.

01:18:31.933 --> 01:18:34.332
Come on! This is ridiculous.

01:18:34.334 --> 01:18:35.400
Shoo.

01:18:35.402 --> 01:18:37.639
Okay. Come on.
Get out of here. Go.

01:18:44.978 --> 01:18:46.681
I'm fine! I'm fine!

01:18:47.948 --> 01:18:49.548
Thomas?

01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:51.285
What are you doing?

01:18:51.851 --> 01:18:53.284
You once said

01:18:53.286 --> 01:18:55.220
that everyone has
a place in this world.

01:18:55.222 --> 01:18:56.789
Well, this is your place,

01:18:56.791 --> 01:18:59.758
and you shouldn't have to leave
because of something I did.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.759
Were they with you?

01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:03.261
Yes. They came to London.

01:19:03.263 --> 01:19:04.929
- "They came to London"?
- Yes.

01:19:04.931 --> 01:19:06.230
Yes. To talk me
into coming back.

01:19:06.232 --> 01:19:08.866
Well, they probably didn't talk.
It was probably all in my head.

01:19:08.868 --> 01:19:10.803
Well... No.
But that's not the point.

01:19:10.805 --> 01:19:12.838
You shouldn't have to leave.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.540
I'm sorry for
everything that I did.

01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:18.309
And I love you, Bea.

01:19:18.311 --> 01:19:19.945
Aw.

01:19:19.947 --> 01:19:21.946
You tried to kill them.

01:19:21.948 --> 01:19:23.781
You blew up their home.

01:19:23.783 --> 01:19:25.016
You blew up my home.

01:19:25.018 --> 01:19:26.718
'Cause I got caught up
in everything, you know?

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.985
I got caught up in our fight.

01:19:27.987 --> 01:19:29.455
"Our" fight?

01:19:29.457 --> 01:19:31.757
You're still going on
about this. Pathetic.

01:19:31.759 --> 01:19:33.024
Come on, Betty, let's go.

01:19:33.026 --> 01:19:34.496
It was my fault.

01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:37.663
I take full responsibility.

01:19:37.665 --> 01:19:38.697
My hero.

01:19:38.699 --> 01:19:41.499
Finally admitting
that he blew up the burrow.

01:19:41.501 --> 01:19:43.468
Not, as you
previously claimed,

01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:47.407
the button on the detonator
being pushed by a rabbit!

01:20:01.987 --> 01:20:03.755
Hello, sweetie.

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:04.759
Are you okay?

01:20:05.693 --> 01:20:06.695
Hmm?

01:20:16.804 --> 01:20:18.536
You were a part of this?

01:20:18.538 --> 01:20:19.707
I told you!

01:20:20.541 --> 01:20:21.543
I did tell you.

01:20:47.399 --> 01:20:48.499
I can't believe this.

01:20:48.501 --> 01:20:49.901
It's a lot to process.

01:20:49.903 --> 01:20:51.639
- It really is.
- Yes.

01:20:56.108 --> 01:20:57.478
Please forgive us.

01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:13.990
You mind moving
all this out the way?

01:21:13.992 --> 01:21:15.727
I mean, this is
our house and all.

01:21:15.729 --> 01:21:16.696
Perfect country gem.

01:21:16.698 --> 01:21:19.096
My stupid sister's
going to be so jealous.

01:21:19.098 --> 01:21:20.898
I'm sorry. The manor's
no longer for sale.

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:23.400
Yeah, 'cause it's already
been sold. We bought it.

01:21:23.402 --> 01:21:25.436
- Sorry, who are you?
- I'm the man who sold it.

01:21:25.438 --> 01:21:28.071
And also the man
who is canceling the sale.

01:21:28.073 --> 01:21:29.842
No. Sale's final.

01:21:29.844 --> 01:21:31.141
You sold it already?

01:21:31.143 --> 01:21:32.544
- Yes, but I...
- You and your husband

01:21:32.546 --> 01:21:34.513
- need to move off now.
- I'm not her husband.

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:35.917
I just... We're...
Although...

01:21:38.117 --> 01:21:40.451
- Get up.
- Bea...

01:21:40.453 --> 01:21:42.487
Come on. There's only one way
out of this.

01:21:42.489 --> 01:21:43.588
- You with me?
- Yep.

01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:44.655
- Absolutely.
- Always.

01:21:44.657 --> 01:21:46.525
- Of course.
- Love you guys.

01:21:46.527 --> 01:21:48.794
Shall we? It's so cute.

01:21:48.796 --> 01:21:51.466
