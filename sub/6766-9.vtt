Mm, mm-mm-mm.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.090
{\an3}Would you look at
this coastline.

00:08.173 --> 00:11.761
{\an3}I cannot believe there's any
beachfront left to be had.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.764
I kind of like this one.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.934
{\an3}No, you don't want
something like that.

00:18.017 --> 00:20.937
You know what, I'm gonna build
something from the ground up.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.480
{\an3}You know, something we
can design ourselves

00:22.564 --> 00:23.940
with a fireman's pole
and sliding board,

00:24.023 --> 00:26.484
{\an1}That's a lot of time,
and a lot of work.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.487
Well, we'll take our
time and do it right.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.781
{\an3}Buy the beachfront property,
rent someplace close.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.617
You make it sound really easy.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.619
Only because it is.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.121
It's a big
commitment, though.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.582
{\an3}So? I'm not afraid
of a big commitment.

00:40.665 --> 00:41.499
In fact, I was even thinking

00:41.583 --> 00:43.251
{\an3}of making a bigger
commitment than that.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.420
Yeah, what's that?

00:45.503 --> 00:47.756
{\an3}Oh, I was thinking
about getting married.

00:47.839 --> 00:48.798
Really?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.633
Anyone special?

00:50.717 --> 00:52.802
Not really, just
this girl I know.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.263
The thing is, I don't
know if she's into it.

00:55.346 --> 00:59.434
{\an1}I guess you'll never know
unless you ask her.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.728
Yep, I guess
you're right.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.443
Marry me.

01:12.071 --> 01:14.783
That wasn't a question, and
you're not down on one knee.

01:14.866 --> 01:18.620
Well, you've got a point.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.051
I do love you.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.222

What do you mean, what happened
to my arm? You were there.

Your friend Joe

Look, I didn't come down here
to make a big deal about it.

04:25.014 --> 04:27.308
{\an3}What I did to you was
wrong and I know it

04:27.392 --> 04:29.102

ask you a favor.

04:34.732 --> 04:35.566
What?

04:35.650 --> 04:37.402
My therapist thinks
it'd be a good idea

04:37.485 --> 04:39.529
{\an3}if you'd come down and
meet with the two of us.

04:39.612 --> 04:40.738
Why?

04:40.822 --> 04:41.531
Well, I guess she wants to,

04:43.032 --> 04:44.575

05:32.665 --> 05:34.584
I just, I could never do it.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.418
{\an3}Maybe if he gets
better, it'll save

05:35.501 --> 05:36.919
{\an3}another girl from
getting hurt.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.379

You know, this was
an incredible idea.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.936
You are far more romantic than
I ever gave you credit for.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.272
It's not romance,
it's pragmatism.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.066

we have to be here

05:58.149 --> 05:59.609
{\an1}for the newspaper

05:59.692 --> 06:01.319

the day at the pool

06:01.402 --> 06:02.779

{\an3}we're gonna make it

06:09.869 --> 06:11.496

what I said.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.212

11:29.105 --> 11:30.439
{\an3}do I get a discount
on gum?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.109
No, but I've got the best
slushie machine in town.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.112
{\an3}(laughs) Have you looked
at these pictures?

11:36.195 --> 11:39.365
Oh, gosh, just be glad <i> we</i>
don't have to dress like that.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.118
Well, 20 years from now,
girls are gonna be looking

11:42.201 --> 11:45.121
at pictures of us and thinking
we look just as weird.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.165
Speak for yourself, girlfriend--
my beauty is eternal.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.292
Oh, wow.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.877
What's the matter?

11:53.212 --> 11:55.131
This... this woman,

11:55.214 --> 11:57.967
she looks just like my mother.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.510
All you blondes
look alike to me.

11:59.593 --> 12:00.886
Oh, funny.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.012
I mean it.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.640
She's, like, the spitting image.

12:04.723 --> 12:05.641
LESLIE:
Donna.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.017
{\an1}Someone's here
to see you.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.310
{\an1}It's, uh, your
favorite quarterback.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.146
Okay, I'll be right there.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.272
Okay.

12:11.355 --> 12:12.606
You okay?

12:12.690 --> 12:14.275
No.

12:14.358 --> 12:17.027
She doesn't just
look like my mother.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.865
I think it is my mother.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.119
Hey, gorgeous.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.079
What are you doing here?

12:27.163 --> 12:28.956
I was in the neighborhood.

12:29.039 --> 12:33.127
Uh, since when is Pasadena
even close to your neighborhood?

12:33.210 --> 12:34.712
All right, busted.

12:34.795 --> 12:38.674
How about I take my favorite
Rose Princess out to lunch?

12:38.757 --> 12:40.384
{\an1}Well, I'm not
a princess yet.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.553
{\an1}But I can't--
I have an appointment.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.555
Oh. Where are you going?

12:44.638 --> 12:49.226
{\an1}I, uh... I told Ray I'd go
with him to see his therapist.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.020
Why?

12:51.103 --> 12:52.563
{\an1}Look, we're not
getting back together,

12:52.646 --> 12:54.064
{\an1}if that's what
you're thinking.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.900
{\an3}Are you sure
that's a good idea?

12:55.983 --> 12:57.902
I mean, he almost hit
you the other night.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.029
{\an1}I just want
to see him get help.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.948
(sighs):
Well...

13:03.032 --> 13:05.534
{\an3}you have to do what
you have to do.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.537
{\an3}And I have to do
what I have to do.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.039
What's that?

13:23.719 --> 13:26.305
{\an3}How about we get our stuff
over to the booth

13:26.388 --> 13:27.097
and grab some lunch?

13:27.181 --> 13:29.391
How about some
That's a good idea.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.560
{\an3}We can eat on the terrace
overlooking the ocean.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.021
{\an1}Or we can eat on the bed
overlooking the television.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.565
{\an1}I hear there's a Jim Nabors
film festival on today.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.025
{\an1}It could be
really exciting.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.109
{\an1}Hi.

13:39.193 --> 13:39.944
{\an3}Hi.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.239
(cle(sighs)oat)

13:43.322 --> 13:46.116
(video game music,
beeping and chiming)

13:48.619 --> 13:51.872
(rumbling)

13:51.956 --> 13:53.749
(clattering)

13:56.126 --> 13:57.461
Earthquake!

14:01.507 --> 14:03.592
Let's go! Go, go!

14:03.676 --> 14:05.844
{\an3}Come on!
Go, go, go!

14:09.974 --> 14:11.058
It's an earthquake.

14:11.141 --> 14:14.270
{\an3}Dylan, hold
(rumbling, clon to me!

14:14.353 --> 14:15.563
{\an3}Dylan...

14:17.356 --> 14:20.150
What the hell is going on?

14:21.026 --> 14:22.069
It's an earthquake.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.196
{\an1}Come on, get
under the table.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.616
(Kelly shrieks)

14:27.700 --> 14:28.867
(shrieks)

14:30.703 --> 14:33.122
(rumbling quiets,
car alarms blare in distance)

14:33.205 --> 14:34.790
{\an3}It's over.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.458
Are you okay?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.127
Colin?

14:38.210 --> 14:40.421
Forget everything I said.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.464
I (laughs).

14:42.548 --> 14:44.300
(panting)

14:44.383 --> 14:46.468
What was that?

14:46.552 --> 14:48.137
{\an3}Earthquake--
at least,

14:48.220 --> 14:50.472
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.808
{\an6}SUSAN:
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

14:52.891 --> 14:54.476
{\an3}WOMAN:
Yeah, I-I think so.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.936
It's dead.

14:56.020 --> 14:56.854
{\an1}BRANDON:
Nothing.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.481
{\an3}Well, then I guess
all we can do is wait.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.276
I'm sure they'll get us
out of here, really.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.444
Hi. I'm Brandon Walsh,

15:03.527 --> 15:04.820
{\an3}and this is, uh,
Susan Keats.

15:04.903 --> 15:06.488
Ellen. Ellen Marks.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.490
(chuckles):
So, Ellen...

15:08.574 --> 15:10.117
{\an3}exactly how
pregnant are you?

15:10.200 --> 15:11.493
I'm due next week.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.537
Oh, my husband,

15:13.621 --> 15:15.539
he's gonna freak
when he can't find me.

15:15.623 --> 15:19.168
Oh, no, I'm sure they'll,
they'll get us out of here soon.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.294
Hello?!

15:20.377 --> 15:21.629
Anybody?!

15:21.712 --> 15:23.922
We're in here!
We're stuck!

15:24.006 --> 15:24.632
Ooh...

15:24.715 --> 15:26.800
Oh, my goodness.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.218
What? What's wrong?

15:28.302 --> 15:30.554
My water broke.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.351
(nervous chuckle)

15:43.150 --> 15:44.902
(siren wailing)

15:44.985 --> 15:46.153
How you doing?

15:46.236 --> 15:47.863
I'm okay so far.

15:47.946 --> 15:49.990
{\an1}I'm a <i> little</i>
scared, though.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.408
{\an3}Well, that makes
three of us.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.868
I don't want
to make things worse,

15:52.951 --> 15:56.914
but, um, my last child
came pretty quickly.

15:56.997 --> 15:59.667
I was only in labor
for a couple of hours.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.877
{\an3}I'm sure they're gonna
get us out of here

16:01.960 --> 16:03.671
{\an3}before anything
like that hapYeah.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.339
{\an3}I'm sure they
just have to...

16:05.422 --> 16:07.591
reprogram the elevator
computer or something.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.718
The elevator computer?

16:11.136 --> 16:13.889
{\an5}WOMAN (on radio):
No such thing as earthquake
weather, huh? What was that?

16:13.972 --> 16:16.725
{\an5}MAN:
Well, according to reports
from Cal Tech, what we had

16:16.809 --> 16:18.227
measured 6.2
on the Richter scale.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.062
But seriously, folks,
there is no such thing

16:20.145 --> 16:21.105
as earthquake weather.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.232
(turns radio off)

16:26.151 --> 16:28.862
(speed dialing)

16:28.946 --> 16:32.116
Daddy, hi. I was just calling
to tell you I'm fine.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.201
Yeah, I'm driving in the car,

16:34.284 --> 16:35.536
I didn't even feel it.

16:35.619 --> 16:36.912
I'm coming back from Pasadena.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.248
We sure felt it here--
this place is a mess.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.708
Are you guys okay?

16:40.791 --> 16:42.710
{\an3}Well, yeah-- shaken
but not stirred.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.044
Dad, I got to ask you

16:44.128 --> 16:45.587
something about Mom.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.257
(statiDonna?kling)

16:48.340 --> 16:50.050
I can't hear y...

16:50.134 --> 16:51.260
Are you there? Donna?

16:51.343 --> 16:53.137
Hello? Dad, it's about Mom.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.972
I thought I saw
a picture of her.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.099
(static crackling)

16:57.182 --> 16:59.768
Hello? Daddy?

16:59.852 --> 17:01.270
(groans)

17:01.353 --> 17:02.354
(phone beeps off)

17:05.315 --> 17:06.942
{\an5}TONI:
<i>I can take</i>
<i>anything else-- storms,</i>

17:07.025 --> 17:09.111
{\an3}fires, floods-- at least
you get a warning.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.405
{\an1}Yeah, well, try living
on the side of a volcano,

17:11.488 --> 17:14.491
see how that grabs you.

17:16.993 --> 17:19.121
(sighs)

17:19.204 --> 17:19.954
Hello?

17:20.038 --> 17:21.498
Bruno?

17:21.582 --> 17:23.166
BRUNO:
<i>Yeah, we're fine.</i>

17:23.250 --> 17:24.917
HNot a nick.u?

17:25.002 --> 17:26.044
And Dad?

17:26.127 --> 17:27.838
He's out of town--
San Francisco.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.965
But he's already called
to find out if you were okay.

17:30.048 --> 17:31.925
Hold on a sec.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.927
{\an3}Think we should
tell him?

17:34.011 --> 17:36.805
{\an1}Yeah, he'll find out
sooner or later.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.515
Bruno, are you sitting down?

17:38.599 --> 17:39.808
Why? What are you talking about?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.102
We're getting married.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.939
Speec(chuckles)ood.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.941
I'm, uh...

17:48.025 --> 17:50.152
just a little shocked,
that's all.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.987
But I'm really happy for you.

17:52.070 --> 17:53.155
Good. You'd better be.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.783
Your father'll be home tomorrow.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.659
Okay. I'll call
him then. Bye.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.329
Now comes the hard part--
we have to tell my father.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.998
{\an1}If I were you, I would let
Bruno worry about that.

18:03.081 --> 18:06.001
What were you saying about
living on the edge of a volcano?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.128
{\an1}That it was fabulous,
and it was hot.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.006
It'd be the place where
(squeals)ake you away.

18:11.089 --> 18:12.841
(birds chirping)

18:12.925 --> 18:14.384
{\an3}Hey. Oh, watch
your step.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.345
COLIN:
Ugh! What a mess.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.513
Yeah, tell me about it.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.680
Hey, how's the loft?

18:18.764 --> 18:19.848
We lucked out.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.850
I mean, some stuff broke,
but then again,

18:21.934 --> 18:23.685
I don't have many breakables.

18:23.769 --> 18:24.895
Except, of course, me.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.021
You scared, huh?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.189
So am I.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.565
No earthquakes in Buffalo.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.692
Ah, but you took it like a pro.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.027
KELLY:
Has anybody heard

18:32.110 --> 18:32.945
from Brandon and Susan?

18:33.028 --> 18:34.696
{\an1}Yeah. Actually,
I called through the hotel,

18:34.780 --> 18:37.157
{\an1}and they rang up to the room,
but there was no answer.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.784
{\an3}So I guess
they're okay.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.744
{\an1}They said there was no damage,
just no lights.

18:40.828 --> 18:41.870
Have youOh, yeah.om Donna?

18:41.954 --> 18:45.040
She was in the car when it hit--
she didn't feel a thing.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.875
{\an3}I told her to come
over here later.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.585
{\an1}You know, we should
just spend the night.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.088
{\an3}You know, throw some blankets
on the living room floor.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.881
Well, we bought enough
food to feed an army.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.049
{\an1}COLIN:
A quake party.

18:54.132 --> 18:56.176
Might as well
make the best of it.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.094
Uh, dead batteries.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.137
Listen, I'm gonna
go out to the garage.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.139
Jim and Cindy have a quake kit.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.726
Did you feel that?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.770
{\an4}VALERIE:
I don't know,
I'm not sure.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.897
{\an3}Well, whatever,
I'm coming with you.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.357
I need to be somewhere

19:10.440 --> 19:12.818
{\an3}where the roof can't
fall on my head.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.862
Okay.

19:14.945 --> 19:17.155
{\an1}Did you see the look
on his face?

19:17.239 --> 19:19.950
{\an1}I don't think he's ever gonna
want to come back inside.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.201
You and Valerie

19:21.285 --> 19:23.036
seem to be getting along well.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.580
Oh, I don't think
this is the right time

19:24.663 --> 19:25.831
to start that conversation.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.416
Well, I wouldn't be
a very good sister

19:27.499 --> 19:28.625
if I didn't say <i> something.</i>

19:28.709 --> 19:32.129
Look, Kel, she was there for me
when I needed her, and, uh,

19:32.212 --> 19:34.089
she's been there
for me ever since.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.425
Well, she always has an agenda.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.926
You remember
that, David.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.094
Give it a rest.

19:39.177 --> 19:42.014
We just had an earthquake.

19:42.097 --> 19:43.557
(door opens)

19:43.640 --> 19:45.142
(door closes, Kelly groans)

19:47.060 --> 19:48.729
{\an1}I'm glad you
could come, Donna.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.105
{\an1}After that rattler,
I didn't think

19:50.188 --> 19:51.940
{\an1}I'd be seeing
<i>any</i> patients today.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.901
{\an3}Well, Ray said
it was important.

19:53.984 --> 19:54.943
{\an1}It is.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.112
HaThanks.at.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.326
Ray wanted you to be here today,

20:02.409 --> 20:04.995
not only because
I have some questions

20:05.078 --> 20:06.788
about your relationship,

20:06.872 --> 20:08.123
but because...

20:08.206 --> 20:10.500
he felt you deserved
some explanation.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.127
{\an3}Thank you.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.630
I know Ray hasn't
talked to you much

20:14.713 --> 20:16.173
{\an1}about his
family background.

20:16.256 --> 20:19.635
But he and I have discussed
his father quite a bit.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.346
A lot of Ray's behavior
started with a very...

20:22.429 --> 20:25.849
violent and
fear-filled childhood.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.935
Your father hit you?

20:29.019 --> 20:31.980
Well, I was little,
but, uh, I remember.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.982
I was really scared of him.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.651
{\an3}I'm sorry.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.819
{\an3}That shouldn't
happen to any kid.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.821
When young children
are abused

20:39.905 --> 20:42.991
by their parents, they're robbed
of the love and security

20:43.075 --> 20:46.161
that they need to thrive
and become healthy adults.

20:46.244 --> 20:47.663
Ray,

20:47.746 --> 20:50.123
could you please give
Donna and me a moment alone?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.251
Sure.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.839
(door opens)

20:57.923 --> 20:58.882
(door closes)

20:58.966 --> 21:00.634
{\an1}Donna...

21:00.717 --> 21:04.680
I want you to know that breaking
a lifelong pattern of abuse

21:04.763 --> 21:06.390
is a very slow process.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.934
{\an1}Ray is not going
to change overnight.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.688
{\an6}(sighs):
Well, I hope
you can help him.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.315
But I have to tell
you, Dr. Phillips,

21:15.399 --> 21:17.359
{\an3}I can't stay
with him anymore.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.361
{\an1}I know-- Ray's
told me how you feel.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.737
I'm sorry.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.030
{\an1}Don't be.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.532
Actually, this therapy

21:23.615 --> 21:26.159
{\an1}has a much better chance
of succeeding without you.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.494
Really?

21:27.577 --> 21:29.246
I've been feeling so guilty.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.872
That's very common.

21:30.956 --> 21:35.043
{\an1}But Ray has to deal
with this on his own.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.879
{\an1}Now, I am
professionally obligated

21:37.963 --> 21:41.049
{\an1}to warn you that Ray is
very unpredictable right now.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.678
{\an1}Kind of like that
earthquake we just had.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.222
{\an1}If you spend time with him,
you are risking

21:47.305 --> 21:50.225
{\an1}a potentially
dangerous situation.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.274
(loud knock)

21:57.357 --> 21:59.443
{\an5}TECHNICIAN:
Hey, how are you guys
doing in there?

21:59.526 --> 22:02.696
Uh, uh, so far, so good,

22:02.779 --> 22:04.698
{\an1}but you'd better
get us out of here,

22:04.781 --> 22:06.533
'cause I don't know nothin'
about birthin' babies.

22:06.616 --> 22:09.244
{\an5}TECHNICIAN:
I have a paramedic
on the way up, just in case.

22:09.327 --> 22:13.248
Now, we're switching over
to the emergency generator now,

22:13.331 --> 22:17.711
and we had to reprogram
the elevator computer.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.546
(chuckles):
I told you so.

22:19.629 --> 22:21.089
(happy shout)

22:21.173 --> 22:22.299
Ah, here we go.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.301
{\an3}We have liftoff.
(chuckling)

22:27.179 --> 22:27.888
What just happened?

22:27.971 --> 22:29.306
TECHNICIAN:
We got a problem.

22:29.389 --> 22:30.974
{\an3}No kidding.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.559
The backup generator keeps
shutting down.

22:32.642 --> 22:33.727
We're working on it,

22:33.810 --> 22:36.730
but the Department
of Water and Power

22:36.813 --> 22:37.981
says it could be

22:38.065 --> 22:41.902
a few more hours till this part
of the grid goes back on-line.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.111
(gasps loudly)

22:43.195 --> 22:45.113
{\an3}What, what?

22:45.197 --> 22:46.990
{\an3}What, what,
what, what?

22:47.074 --> 22:48.950
Don't worry.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.495
We're gonna get through this.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.622
{\an3}Ah, looks like we're
gonna have a baby.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.748
{\an3}(chuckles)

23:09.012 --> 23:12.682
Well, Jim and Cindy do have
an earthquake kit all right.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.309
The only problem is,
it was buried

23:14.392 --> 23:15.477
behind a garage
full of junk.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.562
Are Val and I
the only ones

23:17.646 --> 23:19.022
who think it's a good
idea to be prepared?

23:19.106 --> 23:19.981
No, everyone thinks it.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.942
{\an1}You two are the only ones
that actually do it.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.318
I can't stand this.

23:23.401 --> 23:24.444
Didn't you feel that last one?

23:24.528 --> 23:25.862
Colin, it was
an aftershock.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.572
{\an3}They're gonna
happen all day.

23:27.656 --> 23:30.117
You guys are standing here
chopping vegetables,

23:30.200 --> 23:32.494
and every once in a while,
the ground rearranges itself

23:32.577 --> 23:34.454
like it's no big deal.
It's like, it's like

23:34.538 --> 23:36.790
<i>The</i> You'll get used to i.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.126
No, I don't think so.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.044
{\an3}Earthquakes
I'll never get used to.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.469
{\an1}Have you ever thought
about doing it

23:49.553 --> 23:51.138
during an earthquake?

23:51.221 --> 23:53.431
What hot-blooded
Angeleno hasn't?

23:57.060 --> 24:00.480
{\an3}Clare, there's a house
full of people.

24:00.564 --> 24:06.361
{\an1}Well, we could make
the earth move quietly.

24:06.444 --> 24:10.031
So quiet, it's like we're
not doing anything at all.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.787
{\an3}We don't have
to be that quiet.

24:23.503 --> 24:26.590
TECHNICIAN:
Brandon, can you hear me?

24:26.673 --> 24:27.883
BRANDON:
Yeah, yeah, I can hear you!

24:27.966 --> 24:30.927
{\an5}TECHNICIAN:
I've got a medic here,
and I've briefed him.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.054
PAUL:
Hi, Brandon. Hi, Ellen.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.806
My name is Paul.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.558
Paul, are you gonna
get us through this?

24:36.641 --> 24:37.767
PAUL:
You bet.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.227
I've delivered lots of babies

24:39.311 --> 24:40.562
in some pretty strange places,

24:40.645 --> 24:42.564
but this is my first elevator.

24:42.647 --> 24:43.440
{\an1}Ours, too.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.400
PAUL:
I'm gonna talk you through this.

24:45.483 --> 24:47.569
We're just gonna let
nature take its course.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.237
You guys are gonna do great.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.739
{\an1}What if nature goes
off course?

24:50.822 --> 24:52.407
I don't even want
to think about it.

24:52.490 --> 24:53.909
This is already
too much for me.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.911
{\an1}I told you we should
have stayed at the hotel.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.662
(sobbing):
I want my husband!

25:01.875 --> 25:04.920
Ellen, Ellen,
listen to me.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.088
Just talk to me, just tell me
about your husband.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.591
He's, he's
a wonderful guy.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.135
He's smart
and he's handsome.

25:13.803 --> 25:16.431
He was supposed
to be here for this.

25:16.514 --> 25:18.558
Talk to me about your kids.

25:18.642 --> 25:23.605
Brian is nine and Kate's four.

25:23.688 --> 25:27.150
They're both really excited
about the baby.

25:27.234 --> 25:30.278
I'm so sorry I ruined your day.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.446
You didn't ruin our day.

25:31.529 --> 25:34.449
You just made it a little more
interesting, that's all.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.743
A lot more interesting.

25:36.826 --> 25:38.119
I saw you at the pool.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.663
I like your bikini.

25:39.746 --> 25:42.958
{\an1}Maybe I'll get back
into one someday.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.503
(grunts loudly)

25:46.586 --> 25:48.672
{\an3}All right, her contractions
are coming fast;

25:48.755 --> 25:49.965
only a few minutes apart.

25:50.048 --> 25:54.552
{\an5}PAUL:
Okay, then, Ellen, relax and
remember your breathing.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.304
(Ellen panting)

25:56.388 --> 25:59.182
Ellen, Ellen,
listen to me.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.767
We're gonna get you
through this.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.519
{\an3}You're gonna
be fine, okay?

26:02.602 --> 26:05.605
You guys are... are so nice.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.190
Thank you.

26:12.737 --> 26:13.655
(knocking)

26:13.738 --> 26:15.615
VALERIE:
It's open!

26:15.699 --> 26:16.825
Hi.

26:16.908 --> 26:17.617
Hey, Donna.

26:17.701 --> 26:18.660
Hey. How's everyone
holding up?

26:18.743 --> 26:20.787
Well, I'm on the verge
of a nervous breakdown,

26:20.870 --> 26:22.664
{\an3}but Kelly says
I'll get used to it.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.874
Oh, can you
believe the apartment?

26:24.958 --> 26:26.293
It's like the whole neighborhood
had an earthquake

26:26.376 --> 26:27.460
and not one thing
in that place moved.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.004
{\an1}I know.
Just one cracked window.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.630
{\an1}The strangest thing
happened to me today.

26:30.714 --> 26:31.965
What could be stranger
than the random

26:32.048 --> 26:33.967
{\an3}redecorating
we had this morning?

26:34.050 --> 26:35.385
Well, I'm at
the Tournament House,

26:35.468 --> 26:37.470
I'm looking through photos
of the old Rose Court.

26:37.554 --> 26:40.390
I flip the page and there
among the 25 finalists

26:40.473 --> 26:42.475
in 1969 is my mom.

26:42.559 --> 26:43.351
No.'re kidding.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.229
But she never even said anything
about it.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.565
She's been so negative about me
being involved.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.567
{\an3}Hmm... maybe
it was just someone

26:50.650 --> 26:51.526
who looks like your mom.

26:51.609 --> 26:52.736
No. Knowing Felice,

26:52.819 --> 26:54.070
{\an1}that's much too simple
of an explanation.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.030
No, Kelly's right.

26:55.113 --> 26:58.074
It was her.
I mean, I would know my own mom.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.075
(doorbell chimes)

26:59.159 --> 27:00.368
I'll get it..

27:04.122 --> 27:05.540
Happy earthquake. Oh!

27:05.623 --> 27:06.583
{\an1}Hi. Kelly.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.043
{\an3}Same to you.
How you doing?

27:08.126 --> 27:09.044
Good.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.045
EveryYeah.else?

27:10.128 --> 27:11.129
STEVE:
Hey, D, what's up?

27:11.212 --> 27:12.464
How'd the house hold up?

27:12.547 --> 27:13.882
{\an3}Well, actually,
you know, it went

27:13.965 --> 27:14.966
{\an3}through the
Long Beach quake,

27:15.050 --> 27:18.428
{\an3}the Sylmar quake, the
popular Northridge quake,

27:18.511 --> 27:20.555
and now
the biggest jolt of all.

27:20.638 --> 27:22.599
{\an3}It's not the biggest
earthquake we've ever had.

27:22.682 --> 27:25.268
I wasn't talking about
the Richter scale, Donna.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.062
{\an1}What are you
talking about?

27:28.813 --> 27:30.273
We're getting married.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.024
What?

27:31.107 --> 27:32.400
{\an3}TONI:
Yep.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.902
You heard the lady.

27:33.985 --> 27:37.906
{\an3}Ah, but I'm not sure
I did. Stud.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.741
{\an3}Hey, congratulations,
you two!

27:39.824 --> 27:41.242
{\an1}Thank you.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.536
I'm really happy
for both of you.

27:43.620 --> 27:46.706
{\an3}Thanks, Kel.
I knew you would be.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.541
Where's Brandon?

27:48.625 --> 27:50.710
{\an3}Uh, actually, he and Susan
picked a great weekend

27:50.794 --> 27:53.046
for the retreat
at the beach hotel.

27:53.129 --> 27:54.756
{\an3}Yeah, I think
the power's still down.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.925
{\an1}Well, it looks like tonight's
dinner has a theme:

27:57.008 --> 27:58.593
Dylan bites the dust.

27:58.676 --> 27:59.594
(laughs)

27:59.677 --> 28:00.595
{\an1}Well, let's forget
the plastic

28:00.678 --> 28:02.430
and bring out the china.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.099
{\an3}Yeah, whatever's
left of it.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.266
Are you guys gonna stay?

28:05.350 --> 28:06.935
Yeah.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.061
Well, come on.
I need some help

28:08.144 --> 28:09.104
setting the dinning room table.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.855
{\an3}STEVE:
No problem.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.572
So Dylan's getting married.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.950
Yeah.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.576
That wasn't easy
for you, was it?

28:23.660 --> 28:24.786
(phone rings)

28:24.869 --> 28:26.621
No.

28:26.704 --> 28:28.623
You did good.

28:28.706 --> 28:30.500
Thanks.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.296
Uh, hey, guys, listen up.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.632
Nat just called. He's got a huge
crowd from the earthquake,

28:37.715 --> 28:39.259
and he lost a lot of dishes.

28:39.342 --> 28:41.803
He said dinner's on him,
if we'll give him a hand.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.304
Can't say no to Nat.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.722
Okay.

28:46.724 --> 28:49.018
BRANDON:
It won't be long now.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.312
PAUL:
Is the faDown! or down?

28:51.396 --> 28:53.314
PAUL:
Good.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.483
Now listen to me, Brandon.
Keep your hands on the head,

28:55.567 --> 28:58.486
and Ellen, you just keep
bearing down. It's almost over.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.196
{\an1}I can't do this!
I can't!

29:00.280 --> 29:01.281
Ellen, Ellen, Ellen, Ellen,

29:01.364 --> 29:03.158
if I can do this,
you can do this.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.075
Come on now. Come on.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.618
{\an5}SUSAN:
You can do this.
You can do this.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.537
{\an3}All right, I can see
the shoulders.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.289
PAUL:
Gently pull them down.

29:09.372 --> 29:10.290
It's twisting!

29:10.373 --> 29:11.499
PAUL:
That's okay. Let it.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.794
Make sure to guide it under
the pelvic bone and hold on.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.004
It's slippery.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.297
Ellen, come on, I need one more

29:17.380 --> 29:18.673
big push out of you. Come on.

29:18.756 --> 29:20.633
{\an3}Give me one big push.
Here we go.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.135
(screams)

29:22.218 --> 29:23.136
(baby crying)

29:23.219 --> 29:24.679
Okay. It's okay, you did it,

29:24.762 --> 29:26.514
Ellen, you did it.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.142
{\an3}You did it.
You did it.

29:29.225 --> 29:31.311
You did it.

29:31.394 --> 29:32.854
It's a boy.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.064
(gasping)

29:35.148 --> 29:36.566
(elevator motor whirs)

29:36.649 --> 29:38.568
We're moving!

29:38.651 --> 29:39.694
Say hello to your son.

29:39.777 --> 29:41.196
(baby crying)

29:41.279 --> 29:45.783
Oh, oh, oh, hello,
little Brandon.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.538
{\an1}Hello, little Brandon.
(chuckles)

29:50.622 --> 29:54.709
(baby cooing and fussing)

29:56.669 --> 29:58.713
(panting)

30:02.008 --> 30:05.553
♪ People sitting spellbound
as she passes through the... ♪

30:05.637 --> 30:08.264
Number 11, pick it up.
Nat, we're backing up here.

30:08.348 --> 30:09.432
{\an3}All right,
all right.

30:09.516 --> 30:12.060
Okay, keep going.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.062
{\an3}Joe, hi. What are
you doing here?

30:14.145 --> 30:15.605
{\an1}The cafeterias dorms
are closed.

30:15.688 --> 30:16.940
How long's the wait?

30:17.023 --> 30:19.192
Um, I can squeeze you in.

30:21.819 --> 30:23.404
Dylan, do me a favor.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.240
{\an3}Take the trash
out in the back.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.616
{\an3}It's starting
to pile up.

30:26.699 --> 30:27.909
IThanks..

30:27.992 --> 30:29.869
{\an3}How'd it go with
the therapist today?

30:29.953 --> 30:31.246
Better than I expected.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.247
Good.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.873
I hope you're right,

30:33.957 --> 30:36.876
{\an3}but if I know guys, he's just
using this therapy thing

30:36.960 --> 30:38.545
as a plot to get you back.

30:38.628 --> 30:42.966
Yeah, well, I have to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.430
{\an3}Do you realize that
if that shelf fell down,

30:49.514 --> 30:51.266
{\an3}we'd be crushed
by canned tomatoes?

30:51.349 --> 30:52.767
Would you relax,
Chicken Little?

30:52.850 --> 30:54.060
The sky is not falling.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.603
{\an3}Tell you what,
Henny PWhat?

30:55.687 --> 30:56.938
{\an3}I'm sleeping
outside tonight.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.606
Want to keep me company?

30:58.690 --> 30:59.732
{\an1}All right.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.112
{\an3}Hi.

31:04.195 --> 31:07.282
{\an1}You and Toni have
the right idea: Hawaii.

31:07.365 --> 31:10.952
{\an1}I'd love to move
to Hawaii tomorrow.

31:11.035 --> 31:12.453
It's a big state.

31:15.081 --> 31:17.458
I'll be back
in a minute.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.302
{\an1}How could you just
waltz in and make your

31:27.385 --> 31:29.429
big announcement
like it was no big deal?

31:29.512 --> 31:31.264
What are you talking about?

31:31.347 --> 31:33.516
You didn't think of my feelings?

31:33.600 --> 31:35.476
Oh, well,d.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.312
thank you for being
so sensitive, then.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.272
You want sensitive?

31:39.355 --> 31:40.440
I'm sorry, Kelly.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.901
Soul mates.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.612
Right.

31:45.695 --> 31:46.654
Tell me something.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.865
Where was Toni when we were
hanging out together

31:48.948 --> 31:50.116
in your past life?

31:50.199 --> 31:50.992
I don't know.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.952
Maybe it never happened.
Maybe it did.

31:53.036 --> 31:55.872
What I know is, I love her,
I love her right now.

31:55.955 --> 31:57.999
Yeah, well, I'm happy for you.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.042
Yeah, you sound thrilled, Kel.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.419
How am I supposed to sound?

32:01.502 --> 32:05.798
I don't know, but I asked you
first, remember?

32:05.882 --> 32:08.009
You said no.

32:08.092 --> 32:09.969
{\an3}You said you had
other plans.

32:10.053 --> 32:14.557
You see, you,
you chose you.

32:20.104 --> 32:23.858
I want to hate her so bad...

32:23.941 --> 32:25.401
but I can't.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.071
She seems really nice.

32:28.154 --> 32:33.368
I'm sorry. I hope
you'll both be very happy.

32:33.451 --> 32:36.037
I hope so, too.

32:38.331 --> 32:44.712
Maybe we each have more
than one soul mate.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.882
Yeah, maybe we do.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.022
JOE:
<i>You must lead a charmed life.</i>

33:03.106 --> 33:04.732
{\an3}Look at this place,
not a scratch.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.901
{\an1}Well, maybe virtue
has its rewards.

33:06.984 --> 33:09.570
{\an3}Then why is my dorm room
such a disaster area?

33:09.654 --> 33:10.613
{\an1}(chuckles)

33:10.697 --> 33:13.241
Hi, Donna.

33:13.324 --> 33:16.077
Ray, what are you doing here?

33:16.160 --> 33:18.246
Well, when I called on the phone
I didn't get an answer,

33:18.329 --> 33:20.581
and I saw your broken window
and decided to board it up.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.125
{\an1}Look, I thought
I made it clear this morning.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.668
{\an1}I do not want
to see you anymore.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.378
Look, I was just trying to help.

33:25.461 --> 33:27.255
{\an3}Don't you listen?
She doesn't need your help.

33:27.338 --> 33:28.423
Hey, was I talking to you?

33:28.506 --> 33:30.550
Ray, please,
will you just leave?

33:34.220 --> 33:35.930
(glass shattering)

33:36.013 --> 33:37.890
Fine. Fix it yourself.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.353
{\an3}Joe, please,
just let him go.

33:49.193 --> 33:49.819
Come on.

33:49.902 --> 33:52.196
{\an1}I'm taking you
back to Brandon's.

34:01.038 --> 34:03.040
(birds chirping)

34:05.710 --> 34:08.337
You sleep Mm...

34:08.420 --> 34:10.630
Mm-hmm.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.509
{\an1}My nightmares are
during the day now.

34:13.592 --> 34:16.679
Well, it's over.

34:16.763 --> 34:19.431
I hope you're right.

34:19.514 --> 34:21.100
MACK (on radio):
Well, what do you have to say

34:21.184 --> 34:22.768
about earthquake weather
now, Jack?

34:22.851 --> 34:24.520
JACK:
An anomaly.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.606
{\an5}MACK:
It wasn't an anomaly.
It was an earthquake.

34:26.688 --> 34:28.315
6.2, to be exact.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.485
Three miles offshore, due west
of downtown Santa Monica.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.195
Enough already.

34:32.277 --> 34:34.322
How many times can they
say the same thing?

34:34.405 --> 34:37.533
Did you feel all the aftershocks
in the middle of the night?

34:37.617 --> 34:39.869
Uh-uh. Slept right through.

34:39.952 --> 34:41.829
So I noticed.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.500
{\an3}You know, we actually slept
together last night.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.380
{\an3}Valerie, that's not
what I meant.

34:51.464 --> 34:52.672
I want to make love to you.

34:52.757 --> 34:53.841
If you can't, that's fine.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.842
But don't make
jokes about it.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.846
{\an3}I'm sorry, it was just
bad timing, I guess.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.182
{\an1}Yeah, chalk it up
to a natural disaster.

35:07.605 --> 35:10.441
KELLY:
Sorry to interrupt.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.694
{\an1}Wow, you and Colin actually
slept outside last night?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.112
You'd be surprised
how comfortable

35:15.196 --> 35:16.239
a chaise lounge can be.

35:16.322 --> 35:19.867
All right, well, uh, I'm going
to take a shower, okay?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.160
Bye.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.206
David, I just want to say

35:25.289 --> 35:27.041
that I'm sorry

35:27.125 --> 35:29.335
about what I said about
you and Valerie.

35:29.418 --> 35:30.711
It's none of my business.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.547
Yeah, you're right,
but that's no big deal.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.382
I really don't care
what you say.

35:34.465 --> 35:35.800
I'm crazy about her.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.347
Hey.

35:42.431 --> 35:43.391
Well, I called school.

35:43.474 --> 35:44.559
No classes today.

35:44.642 --> 35:47.895
They have to inspect
all the buildings.

35:47.979 --> 35:48.896
Where's Joe?

35:48.980 --> 35:50.356
{\an1}Did I see his feet
sticking out from a blanket

35:50.439 --> 35:51.399
around here last night?

35:51.482 --> 35:52.692
Are you kidding?

35:52.775 --> 35:54.068
He can't sleep
anywhere but the dorm.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.069
The whole team has a curfew.

35:55.152 --> 35:57.238
You know, I think you've
got a keeper, Donna.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.407
Thanks. I think so, too.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.075
So, are you going to Pasadena?

36:01.158 --> 36:01.617
11:00.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.077
Want me to go with you?

36:03.161 --> 36:04.245
Thanks, but I think
this is something

36:04.328 --> 36:05.538
I want to do by myself.

36:05.621 --> 36:08.791
You know what, I'm
really proud of you.

36:08.875 --> 36:11.919
No matter what happens,
you really went for it.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.590
JACK (on radio):
Okay, the talk all day is,

36:15.673 --> 36:17.425
where were you
when the little one hit?

36:17.508 --> 36:19.260
We brought a life
into this world.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.137
C(turns radio off)?

36:23.139 --> 36:24.599
No.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.309
I can't.

36:26.392 --> 36:30.229
{\an1}I was completely
terrified, you know.

36:30.313 --> 36:33.149
But when I saw you put that
baby in his mother's arms,

36:33.232 --> 36:37.069
it was really... the most
wonderful feeling I've ever had.

36:37.153 --> 36:39.989
I'll never forget that.

36:40.072 --> 36:41.741
{\an3}What do you think
the chances are

36:41.824 --> 36:44.118
{\an3}we'll ever do anything
like that again?

36:44.201 --> 36:47.163
Um, gee, people
do it every day.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.998
{\an1}Ever heard of marriage
and children?

36:49.081 --> 36:51.250
Sure, but not in elevators.

36:53.669 --> 36:56.255
I'm really proud of you.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.632
You were really great.

36:57.715 --> 37:01.510
{\an3}Well, you were no slouch
yourself, Keats.

37:04.430 --> 37:07.308
{\an1}Maybe I could keep you
around for a while.

37:07.391 --> 37:10.311
You know, just in case
I have any emergencies.

37:10.394 --> 37:12.772
Kind of like a spare set
of fresh batteries, huh?

37:12.855 --> 37:14.690
Mm-hmm.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.151
{\an3}Mm. I've got some
fresh batteries for you.

37:17.234 --> 37:18.653
(shrieks)

37:18.736 --> 37:20.696
{\an5}WOMAN:
As you know, the theme
of this year's

37:20.780 --> 37:23.032
Tournament of Roses is
Kids, Hopes and Dreams.

37:23.115 --> 37:23.991
All of us here

37:24.075 --> 37:27.620
at the Tournament House
wish you good luck.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.415
(door closes)

37:38.297 --> 37:40.174
{\an1}Number 675,
your question is:

37:40.257 --> 37:43.886
What can we as
individuals do

37:43.970 --> 37:45.680
to insure that our children,

37:45.763 --> 37:50.726
and every child, can realize
their hopes and their dreams?

37:52.603 --> 37:55.648
That's a very interesting
question.

37:58.275 --> 38:00.695
No, I'm wrong.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.822
It's a very tragic question.

38:02.905 --> 38:06.200
{\an3}I never realized
until recently

38:06.283 --> 38:10.037
just how fragile children are.

38:10.121 --> 38:14.208
You see, I know this man
who was hit so often

38:14.291 --> 38:16.335
when he was a child,

38:16.419 --> 38:19.880
he grew up thinking
it was normal.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.883
And now that he's a man,

38:22.967 --> 38:26.637
whenever he gets angry, he hits.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.683
I know this because he hit me.

38:33.644 --> 38:36.397
Children are filled with
so many hopes and dreams,

38:36.480 --> 38:40.568
but their futures are
built on our love.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.779
We must protect
our children's hearts,

38:43.863 --> 38:46.907
or their souls can be
damaged forever.

38:49.994 --> 38:54.415
I'd like to thank you for
this wonderful opportunity.

38:54.498 --> 38:57.168
You've helped fulfill
one of my dreams.

39:05.384 --> 39:06.719
Hi, Dad.

39:06.802 --> 39:07.970
Hi, sweetheart.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.268
We meet again.

39:14.351 --> 39:15.561
{\an3}Yes.

39:15.644 --> 39:16.854
Nice to see you.

39:18.647 --> 39:21.233
{\an1}I see the earthquake
didn't hit you too hard.

39:21.317 --> 39:25.071
No. Nothing can take
down this house.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.572
It's built like a fortress.

39:26.655 --> 39:30.409
So this must be the bunker,
then?

39:33.329 --> 39:36.499
Let's just say
I have a lot to protect.

39:42.004 --> 39:44.173
{\an3}We have some very
important news for you.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.384
Yes,

39:46.467 --> 39:48.260
I already know.

39:48.344 --> 39:51.514
Bruno's already told me.

39:51.597 --> 39:53.474
I'm sorry. I should have
told you myself.

39:53.557 --> 39:56.685
No... no, I'm glad he did.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.648
It gave me time
to get over the shock.

40:02.024 --> 40:04.276
Your blessing would mean
a lot to us.

40:09.573 --> 40:12.409
What would you do,
if you were me?

40:12.493 --> 40:14.328
I'm not you.

40:39.228 --> 40:42.356
{\an3}This was your
mother's Bible.

40:42.439 --> 40:45.234
She carried it down
the aisle at our wedding.

40:46.485 --> 40:48.112
Thank you.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.545
{\an3}I'm so glad that we could all
find time to have lunch.

41:04.628 --> 41:07.381
{\an3}Your mom and I did not want
to go off to Europe

41:07.464 --> 41:09.383
{\an3}without spending a little
time with you first.

41:09.466 --> 41:10.551
Well, I've been very busy.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.720
Yeah, haven't we all.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.221
{\an3}DadYeah?

41:14.305 --> 41:17.224
I made it to the finals,
the Tournament of Roses.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.893
I had my last interview today.

41:18.976 --> 41:20.227
{\an3}I didn't know you were
still doing that.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.395
Why didn't you tell us?

41:21.478 --> 41:23.230
Well, Mom was so negative.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.566
She didn't think
I'd make it this far, I guess.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.401
I just didn't want
to give her the satisfaction.

41:27.484 --> 41:29.069
{\an3}Donna...

41:29.153 --> 41:30.738
Maybe I thought she was right.

41:30.821 --> 41:33.657
I guess maybe I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

41:33.741 --> 41:36.535
Maybe we should talk
about this at lunch.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.913
Just clear the air, okay?

41:38.996 --> 41:40.581
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

41:40.664 --> 41:43.042
The traffic on La Cienega
was just awful.

41:43.125 --> 41:44.126
Hi, sweetheart,

41:44.210 --> 41:45.252
Dr. Martin,
before you go.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.046
Rosella wants you
to take a look

41:47.129 --> 41:48.088
at Mr. Ungar's
cardiogram.

41:48.172 --> 41:50.633
{\an3}Okay, uh, just, just give me
two seconds, sweetheart.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.259
Sure.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.262
{\an3}Sweetheart, this is
really a pretty dress.

41:55.346 --> 41:58.432
{\an3}You don't usually wear things
that are so conservative.

41:58.515 --> 42:00.809
{\an1}Well, I thought it was
appropriate for Pasadena.

42:00.893 --> 42:02.061
Excuse me?

42:02.144 --> 42:04.271
I'm a Rose Court finalist, Mom.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.940
I had my final interview today.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.524
Well...

42:09.527 --> 42:11.403
{\an3}Why didn't
you say something?

42:11.487 --> 42:14.240
Because you made it quite
clear you didn't approve.

42:14.323 --> 42:15.574
No, I don't.

42:15.658 --> 42:17.952
Why not?

42:18.035 --> 42:21.455
{\an1}'Cause you didn't
make the final cut?

42:21.538 --> 42:22.790
Excuse me?

42:22.873 --> 42:25.417
I was looking through
a photo album

42:25.501 --> 42:26.752
at the Tournament House
yesterday.

42:26.835 --> 42:27.795
You were a contestant

42:27.878 --> 42:29.421
{\an1}in 1969,
weren't you?

42:29.505 --> 42:31.257
{\an3}I don't know what you're
talking about, Donna.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.508
You know, you're
a terrible liar, Mom.

42:32.591 --> 42:34.426
Although I can't imagine
for the life of me

42:34.510 --> 42:35.678
You're mistaken, Donna.

42:35.761 --> 42:37.596
No, I'm not mistaken.
I saw the picture.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.056
I know what my own mother...

42:39.139 --> 42:40.933
{\an3}Look, if you would like
to do this Rose Bowl thing,

42:41.016 --> 42:43.269
{\an3}fine, fine. Far be it for me
to stand in your way.

42:43.352 --> 42:44.812
{\an1}Is that all you
have to say?

42:44.895 --> 42:46.814
Good luck.

42:46.897 --> 42:49.525
So, are my girls
ready for lunch?

42:51.443 --> 42:54.029
I'm not going, Daddy.

42:54.113 --> 42:56.824
{\an1}I don't really feel much
like lunch right now.

43:03.455 --> 43:04.373
What happened?

43:04.456 --> 43:07.209
She saw my picture, John.

43:07.293 --> 43:08.544
The Rose Bowl picture?

43:17.761 --> 43:21.348
Well, you're gonna have
to tell her the truth.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.475
I can't. We can't.

43:23.559 --> 43:25.519
Think of what that
would mean to her.

43:25.602 --> 43:27.021
She's a big girl, Felice.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.522
I think she can handle it.

43:31.984 --> 43:35.321
Maybe, but I don't know
if I can.

43:39.616 --> 43:42.119
Damn it.

43:43.954 --> 43:45.789
Dylan and Toni are gone.

43:48.625 --> 43:50.377
Everything clear?

43:50.461 --> 43:51.337
Crystal.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.213
No slipups.

43:53.297 --> 43:56.050
No tracing it back.

43:56.133 --> 43:57.843
I want him dead.

43:57.926 --> 43:59.345
Don't worry.

43:59.428 --> 44:01.680
It's a done deal.
