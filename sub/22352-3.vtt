WEBVTT

00:12.262 --> 00:15.557
-[Antoine] Gay people suck!
-[Renee laughs] I know, right?

00:15.640 --> 00:17.976
[Antoine] No, I mean... pff...

00:18.059 --> 00:21.229
It's just playing games.
Like... you know, I get it.

00:21.312 --> 00:22.355
His boyfriend loses interest

00:22.439 --> 00:26.317
so he just macks
on some random guy at the club and...

00:27.652 --> 00:29.988
stokes a fire of jealousy, I guess.
I don't know.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.239
What an asshole.

00:31.322 --> 00:33.867
-Obviously, you're too good for him.
-Well, obviously.

00:34.367 --> 00:38.413
Hey, listen, I wanna thank you
for making my anti-social ass

00:38.496 --> 00:39.748
come out tonight, I...

00:40.623 --> 00:41.958
I had fun.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.418
Anytime, sweet cheeks.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.378
You had fun tonight, too.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.465
-See ya.
-[Renee] See ya.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.685
[huffs]

01:06.775 --> 01:07.776
[tires screech]

01:10.653 --> 01:11.654
[distant barking]

01:19.829 --> 01:21.915
Pretty late to be out walking alone.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.167
You gay boy.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.379
I don't want any trouble, man.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.675
So you been out at the clubs,
you cocksucker?

01:33.843 --> 01:35.637
Or at one of those bathhouses?

01:37.555 --> 01:39.390
Why don't I just walk back
the way I came?

01:45.021 --> 01:46.481
[softly]
You don't wanna do this.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.442
[grunts]

01:53.321 --> 01:54.906
Violence begets violence.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.410
You throw hurt into the universe,
it comes back at you twice as hard.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.122
It's called karma.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.206
Hmm.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.842
You know,
I've put the hurt on a lot of fags.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.885
[grunts]

02:18.346 --> 02:19.389
Come here.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.099
So...

02:21.182 --> 02:24.894
where's this "karma" that's gonna
swoop down and punish me?

02:26.521 --> 02:28.022
You're looking at it.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.536
Remember...

02:41.619 --> 02:43.454
remember what a faggot did to you.

03:02.223 --> 03:03.266
[screams]

03:04.058 --> 03:05.894
-Oh, Jesus.
-[sobs] Oh, God.

03:05.977 --> 03:06.895
[Mark] Don't look.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.400
[Mark] Oh, God.

03:13.776 --> 03:14.944
Oh, shit.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.989
[Mark] Go back!

03:18.072 --> 03:19.741
Stay back, please!

03:20.617 --> 03:21.618
Please go back!

03:21.701 --> 03:24.370
-You don't wanna see this.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

03:25.204 --> 03:26.706
Oh, my God, her eyes.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.499
Oh, my--!

03:30.001 --> 03:31.002
[gasps]

03:31.586 --> 03:33.546
-Jesus Christ. Fuck.
-[Dawn sobbing]

03:37.008 --> 03:38.426
[Dawn] Why would they do that?

03:41.471 --> 03:42.305
[Noah] Fuck.

03:47.143 --> 03:51.689
[Peter] I just wanted to say thanks for...
opening your doors to us.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.733
I imagine we're not
your favorite people right now.

03:53.816 --> 03:54.901
[Antoine laughing]

03:54.984 --> 03:56.361
-You think?
-Antoine.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.363
She fired a shot at you guys.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.823
They were warning shots,
and I don't have x-ray vision.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.158
I couldn't see
through a wooden fucking door.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.076
Dawn.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.578
-They could be the killers.
-Antoine, we are not the ones doing this.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.581
The three of us were locked in the cabin
while Susan was being slaughtered,

04:08.665 --> 04:09.749
so how could it be us?

04:09.832 --> 04:12.377
Well, you guys did go in your rooms
and then close your doors.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.461
[both]
Shut up, Noah!

04:13.544 --> 04:16.923
Look, look.
Susan and Andy were our friends.

04:17.674 --> 04:18.800
Why would we kill them?

04:18.883 --> 04:20.385
I can take a wild guess.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.595
To cover up
whatever happened to that girl.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.265
Really, man?
We already talked about this, okay?

04:25.348 --> 04:26.724
We told you the truth.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.893
We didn't know Talvinder
and we weren't her friends.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.436
You told us lies.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.855
-What happened to her, huh?
-Just stop.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.525
Come on, just stop. Stop.
This is pointless.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.904
In the morning, we head to Gene's.
We use his phone to call the police.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.824
Whatever happened that night,
if anything, they'll find out.

04:44.075 --> 04:47.245
I know I sound like a broken record,
but we all need rest, desperately.

04:47.662 --> 04:48.621
I'll get them settled.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.249
Come over here.

04:54.043 --> 04:55.044
[Glenn] All right.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.007
[sizzling]

04:59.590 --> 05:00.675
Really?

05:01.634 --> 05:02.927
Smoked pork knuckle.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.346
Which is actually a misnomer

05:05.430 --> 05:07.307
because it's not a cut
from the pig's hand.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.725
It's from his arm.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.729
God bless Gene. He brought me
some amazing cuts of meat.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.441
-I don't know how you eat that.
-Usually with fork and knife.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.943
Maybe a little mustard
if I'm feeling crazy.

05:19.694 --> 05:20.695
[chuckles]

05:22.280 --> 05:24.115
Meet me outside in five minutes.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.578
-What?
-Don't let anyone see you leave.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.999
-Why?
-Five minutes.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.093
Thank you for letting me crash here.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.722
Of course. My pleasure.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.226
Dawn... [sighs]

05:55.188 --> 05:56.355
I need to say something.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.275
Okay.

05:59.358 --> 06:02.737
Sometimes, when a cloud forms,

06:03.446 --> 06:06.282
the best thing is for a storm
to come along

06:06.365 --> 06:10.078
and clear all the pressure
so we can all start fresh.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.413
Yeah. Why don't you tell Keira that?

06:12.497 --> 06:14.665
I don't think I'm getting any do-overs
from her.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.169
You need to understand something.

06:20.338 --> 06:24.592
We all came to We Live As One
lost and broken.

06:25.968 --> 06:31.390
And here, we all found the thing
that we needed to feel whole again.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.894
So we're protective.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.272
So you see us as a threat.

06:41.984 --> 06:42.985
Yes.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.570
I do.

06:46.239 --> 06:50.409
But I am trying to keep an open mind
and an open heart,

06:50.493 --> 06:53.621
and I only ask
that you try to do the same.

07:01.671 --> 07:02.755
I'm gonna go brush my teeth.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.090
The bathroom's down the hallway,

07:04.173 --> 07:07.552
and I'll just go and get you an extra
blanket and pillow from downstairs.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.845
Cool. Thank you.

08:16.787 --> 08:17.955
[clicks]

08:26.088 --> 08:27.340
What are we doing here?

08:30.718 --> 08:32.094
You'll understand when you see it.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.649
[clatters]

08:59.664 --> 09:00.748
[lid bangs]

09:02.083 --> 09:03.084
[gasps]

09:05.962 --> 09:08.172
-What is that?
-It's Talvinder.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.426
[Antoine] That girl who went missing.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.681
No one can know she's here.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.403
"The rare and elusive  lactarius indigo...

09:32.113 --> 09:36.242
sometimes found within dead trees...

09:39.203 --> 09:40.913
and rocky enclosures."

09:42.873 --> 09:44.750
Seek and ye shall find.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.977
Or a rocky enclosure.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.110
[grunts]

10:14.572 --> 10:16.032
[gasps] Holy shit.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.347
I found her in a cave last summer.
Her skull looked bashed in.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.933
I couldn't leave her remains
for someone else to find.

10:44.852 --> 10:45.770
Why not?

10:49.231 --> 10:51.692
You were on the verge
of closing the deal on the property.

10:51.776 --> 10:52.610
So?

10:53.944 --> 10:56.530
So who the hell would buy land
that someone was murdered on?

10:56.614 --> 10:59.283
This deal went through months ago.
Why is she still here?

11:01.869 --> 11:02.870
[sighs]

11:05.373 --> 11:06.624
Because...

11:09.710 --> 11:11.879
'cause her body might be contaminated.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.049
-How contaminated?
-With my fucking DNA!

11:15.132 --> 11:17.593
You didn't even know the girl.
You weren't even here five years ago.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.845
You think the cops
are gonna care about that?

11:20.846 --> 11:22.348
They're gonna pull my life apart.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.602
They're gonna poke into every dark corner
searching for something,

11:26.685 --> 11:28.687
anything they can find to pin it on me.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.405
You made a terrible mistake.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.867
You should've left the remains
where you found them.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.581
I know.

11:48.916 --> 11:52.086
Why didn't you tell me, huh?
Why didn't you tell me, your life partner?

11:52.169 --> 11:53.337
I could've helped you
figure something out.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.048
-Come up with a solution.
-Renee, please.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.051
I got scared.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.178
Then I shut down.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.474
If I could do it all over again,

12:07.143 --> 12:08.811
I would tell you right away.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.859
Is there anything else
you're keeping from me?

12:16.694 --> 12:17.736
No.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.073
I swear.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.664
All right.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.083
Okay.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.797
We'll face this
like we face all our problems.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.176
Together.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.097
[Antoine sighs]

12:50.394 --> 12:51.729
[fire crackles]

13:13.834 --> 13:15.085
Do you want a hand?

13:17.713 --> 13:19.298
Sure, yes. Thank you.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.561
Look...

13:34.146 --> 13:37.066
-Sorry, I'm a bundle of nerves.
-That's okay.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.151
I think we all are.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.536
Thank you.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.419
[sighs]

13:58.796 --> 13:59.964
[Peter] What time is it?

14:01.507 --> 14:02.758
Just past 3:00.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.011
"The Devil's hour."

14:08.597 --> 14:09.848
Thought that was midnight.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.351
[Mark] Midnight is the witching hour.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.230
3 a.m. belongs to the devil.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.524
[Peter] Okay, I'll bite.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.234
Why?

14:23.946 --> 14:26.615
Jesus died on the cross at 3:00 p.m.

14:28.617 --> 14:33.414
And so the devil chose
the opposite time, 3:00 a.m.,

14:33.497 --> 14:36.250
to pervert his sacrifice
and have a nightly celebration.

14:38.794 --> 14:43.257
It's a time when demons and ghouls
come out from under the cover of darkness,

14:44.300 --> 14:47.845
to torment and terrify us, His children.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.349
Way to lighten the mood, bro.
[chuckles]

14:52.433 --> 14:54.852
Three people are dead.
Do you think that would be appropriate?

14:59.773 --> 15:01.025
[mutters]
All right.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.987
-[Mark] Let's all cut the bullshit here.
-[yawns]

15:06.322 --> 15:10.576
-We all know what's going on here.
-[Peter] And what's that, exactly?

15:10.659 --> 15:13.913
Well, we're all exhausted,
but none of us can trust the others

15:13.996 --> 15:16.540
long enough so that we can get some sleep.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.210
-You're right.
-[Mark] So the question becomes,

15:20.294 --> 15:22.713
can we set aside our suspicions
for a few hours

15:22.796 --> 15:25.174
long enough to grab some Z's?

15:26.342 --> 15:27.551
I know I can.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.304
I can do that.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.475
[Noah]
I guess I can make that happen, yeah.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.851
We're too vulnerable sleeping alone.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.562
-I think it's safer if we bunk together.
-I'm not tired.

15:38.646 --> 15:42.316
I'll stay, keep watch,
long as I can stay awake.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.861
You bunk with me, Peter.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.281
[sighs]

15:50.741 --> 15:52.826
Well, it looks like
it's you and me, champ.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.078
Great.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.121
Don't worry, I don't bite.
[chuckles]

15:58.540 --> 15:59.625
Well, this is it.

16:00.209 --> 16:03.337
Barely enough room to swing a cat.
But then, I'm a dog guy anyway.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.297
[laughs]

16:05.381 --> 16:06.465
Okay.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.802
It's not the biggest room
in the house, but...

16:10.636 --> 16:13.055
we've got the bonus
of an  en suite  crapper,

16:13.138 --> 16:15.766
which I definitely need
'cause I pee a lot at night.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.142
I hope it doesn't bother you.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.646
Doctor says I've got the bladder
of a 12-year-old boy. [laughs]

16:21.230 --> 16:22.856
I don't know what that means.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.233
You know, I think I should...

16:24.316 --> 16:26.694
I should probably just try
and get some sleep.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.487
Yeah, yeah, sure. You know what?

16:28.570 --> 16:32.491
Here, take these blankets
and I will find another one.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.284
-It's okay.
-No, no, go ahead.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.370
Thanks.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.205
[groans, winces]

16:38.288 --> 16:41.166
-Wow, you are in a shitload of pain, huh?
-Yeah.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.837
I know you guys are all, like,
naturopathic and shit, but...

16:45.087 --> 16:46.714
[laughing]

16:46.797 --> 16:47.631
Yeah, I'd...

16:48.507 --> 16:52.219
I'd give my left nut for, you know,
some sweet chemical to dull the pain.

16:52.302 --> 16:54.221
Left nut, huh?
[laughing]

16:54.304 --> 16:55.514
That's funny.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.933
[Glenn] Tell you what.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.773
All right.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.444
Now, drugs around here
are completely forbidden.

17:08.527 --> 17:13.323
But, lucky you,
I don't always follow the rules.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.285
Huh...?

17:16.702 --> 17:17.828
Fuck them hippies, right?

17:18.954 --> 17:22.958
Now, remember,
this is strictly clandestine.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.419
Now listen to me.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.423
You treat this like it was cocaine.
Do you understand me?

17:29.506 --> 17:31.091
This is between you and me.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.345
Yeah, brother.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.807
Mum's the word, roomie.
[chuckles]

17:40.017 --> 17:41.018
[mutters] All right.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.269
Go ahead.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.536
All right.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.790
Well, tidy tank's gonna hit the head,
if you know what I mean.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.918
You let me know if you need anything else.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.765
[whispers] Fuck.

18:34.655 --> 18:35.656
[gasping]

19:14.361 --> 19:16.947
[Renee] I still think we should leave
the body where you found it.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.910
[Antoine] For the police to discover?
Fuck, no.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.037
Hey, you!

20:06.121 --> 20:08.207
-Hey.
-Come on, come on over.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.459
Get out of the rain.
Have some tea with me.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.130
Someone's wound up tight.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.634
Come on, come over. It'll relax you.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.136
Coming.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.477
-Your "tea" is very relaxing.
-[laughs]

20:29.436 --> 20:30.604
Yes, it is.

20:34.858 --> 20:35.692
What happened there?

20:38.987 --> 20:40.656
Oh, uh...

20:41.073 --> 20:44.076
it's like a drunken, stupid,

20:45.035 --> 20:49.331
falling-into-a-door kind of accident.

20:50.082 --> 20:54.044
Very, very early this morning.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.130
You're acting really weird.

20:58.715 --> 20:59.549
Talk to me.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.469
[sighs]

21:05.180 --> 21:06.890
It's nothing, it's just...

21:08.225 --> 21:09.226
[sighs]

21:12.104 --> 21:14.106
I'm just really fed up, I'm just...

21:15.148 --> 21:16.775
fed up with the anger in this city.

21:16.858 --> 21:19.736
I am fed up with the toxic environments,

21:19.820 --> 21:23.865
and I'm fucking fed up
with this empty gay dating environment.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.913
Sometimes I just wonder why...

21:31.290 --> 21:34.960
it can't be like it is with you and me.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.379
It's always so,

21:37.462 --> 21:41.049
like, genuine and authentic.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.469
-What we have is perfect.
-Yeah.

21:45.595 --> 21:49.766
Except for the little problem
with our anatomies not liking each other.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.144
-[laughing]
-I do like the vagina.

21:52.227 --> 21:54.146
-You do.
-And the labia.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.441
And this weed.

22:02.612 --> 22:06.366
Hey, do you know
what an intentional community is?

22:08.744 --> 22:11.079
Yeah. It's the suburbs I grew up in.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.248
Intentionally close-minded,
intentionally cookie cutter,

22:13.332 --> 22:15.751
and intentionally fucking boring.

22:17.169 --> 22:21.631
Yeah, well, remember I told you my parents
had this summer camp up north

22:21.715 --> 22:24.301
-went belly up?
-Uh-huh.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.596
It was beautiful. It was really beautiful.

22:27.679 --> 22:30.849
It has these islands
and these rolling hills,

22:30.932 --> 22:33.185
and lots of trees.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.772
What if we winterized the place
and made it a year-round property?

22:39.232 --> 22:40.067
Why?

22:42.194 --> 22:44.946
I don't know, we could start
our own community, you know?

22:45.906 --> 22:47.282
And build something from the ground up

22:47.365 --> 22:51.661
with like-minded people
who share the same line and ideas--

22:51.745 --> 22:55.373
just wanna reject everything negative
in our lives.

22:57.501 --> 23:00.295
[sighs] I don't-- I don't get it.

23:00.378 --> 23:03.673
-You wanna move up north?
-Mm.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.512
Yeah, yeah.

23:08.595 --> 23:12.015
You could do massage therapy,
teach yoga.

23:13.058 --> 23:16.186
I could teach meditation
and hold healing circles.

23:19.439 --> 23:22.067
And we would be non-hierarchical
and inclusive,

23:22.150 --> 23:24.194
standing for integrity
in everything we do.

23:25.695 --> 23:31.034
We could nourish each other with dance
and music, and healthy vegan food.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.786
[laughing]

23:32.869 --> 23:37.332
There'd be no internet, no cell phone,
no cable TV, nothing to distract us.

23:40.669 --> 23:41.837
It would be paradise.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.970
-[motor whines]
-Come on!

23:54.015 --> 23:55.475
[motor whining]

23:56.434 --> 23:58.061
[groaning]

24:02.482 --> 24:03.859
Please hurry up.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.194
We have to get back
before they wonder what we're doing.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.571
I'm going as fast as I can.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.030
[motor whining]

24:11.158 --> 24:12.117
Shit.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.535
It's not gonna work.

24:16.329 --> 24:17.956
Have to pull her body apart...

24:18.623 --> 24:20.375
bury her in different places.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.753
-Are you kidding me?
-The ground is fucking frozen, Renee!

24:24.588 --> 24:27.257
I can't dig a hole deep enough
to bury her fucking body!

24:27.340 --> 24:29.009
Don't you see that?

24:30.343 --> 24:32.053
Okay, you don't have to swear at me.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.682
Oh, God.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.310
[cracking]

24:40.770 --> 24:41.771
[grunts]

24:49.613 --> 24:50.989
Oh, God! Oh, God!

24:52.073 --> 24:54.451
[panting]

24:57.412 --> 25:00.540
We can't pull this poor girl apart
and bury her in some unmarked grave.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.715
Well, what the hell are we gonna do?

25:09.382 --> 25:11.051
This is not who we are.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.844
This is not the reason we came here.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.680
If we stray from the values
we know to be true,

25:15.764 --> 25:18.058
then everything we've created
will be destroyed.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.435
Integrity in everything we do, remember?

25:22.270 --> 25:23.980
So what do we do with the body?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.861
We give her back to her parents.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.157
And in the meantime?

25:35.075 --> 25:37.244
If the others see this,
they're gonna think I'm the killer.

25:40.455 --> 25:41.957
We'll bring her back to the shed.

25:42.707 --> 25:45.877
We wait until the police arrive.
But we do do the right thing here.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.181
[slurps]

25:58.265 --> 25:59.975
Dude, do you have to eat like that?

26:02.102 --> 26:05.105
-Eat like what? What's your problem?
-[Peter] Okay, sun's up.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.856
-Let's get going.
-[Mark] Cool your jets.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.525
Renee and Antoine aren't down yet.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.572
[Renee] Judith.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.157
Those pancakes smell divine.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.618
You guys are late. Where were you?

26:21.162 --> 26:23.957
There are no bosses here.
Stop acting like one.

26:24.833 --> 26:28.211
We were outside doing sun salutations.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.005
I do them every morning, rain or shine.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.007
I thought yoga was supposed
to make you calm.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.301
[Antoine]
Let's focus on getting to Gene's.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.679
It's 30 klicks away, which is a long walk
in sub-zero temperatures.

26:37.762 --> 26:41.683
Susan and me, we saw an old RV
out in the woods last night.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.685
Couldn't we all just climb in that
and drive out?

26:43.768 --> 26:44.894
[Glenn] It's my RV.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.814
And I'm telling you, it's not getting
ten feet in this ice and snow.

26:47.897 --> 26:49.065
Don't be a retard.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.609
You know,
we're not allowed to say that word.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.236
-You fucking retard.
-[Peter] Guys, we'll walk.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.779
[Noah] No, we won't walk, man.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.782
Exhibit A, exhibit B.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.743
You still think that's a good idea?

26:59.826 --> 27:02.495
This time, we won't be two panicked people
running through the snow.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.833
This time, we'll be a group,
with a plan, prepared.

27:06.916 --> 27:09.794
-That's not a plan. It's suicide.
-I'm sorry, you got a better idea, bud?

27:09.878 --> 27:11.671
Nope. I'm eating breakfast.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.590
[Peter] Here's the deal. Two groups.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.091
Group number one stays here.

27:15.175 --> 27:17.719
Group number two
will go on the trek with me.

27:17.802 --> 27:20.597
And I'm taking the strongest people.
Do I have any objections?

27:20.680 --> 27:23.266
-Not from me. It's a good plan.
-Yeah, I'm up for it.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.518
I can't sit around here anymore.
I'm going stir crazy.

27:25.602 --> 27:26.895
I think it's a good idea.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.856
But do you need to take
all the strongest people?

27:29.939 --> 27:31.524
We'll be like sitting ducks here.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.068
She's right. We can't all go.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.737
Oh, I'm sorry, Judith,
I wasn't thinking. I'll stay.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.113
You do what you wanna do.

27:37.655 --> 27:38.823
Let me stay.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.325
I've taken self-defense courses.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.493
[laughing]

27:42.494 --> 27:44.537
Self-defense courses.

27:44.621 --> 27:45.705
I'll stay too.

27:45.789 --> 27:49.209
[Peter] Okay, guys, guys, it's decided.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.752
You guys stay here.

27:50.835 --> 27:53.838
Renee, Dawn, Mark and Glenn,
you guys come with me.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.673
We leave in five.

27:57.425 --> 27:58.301
[Dawn] I need a minute.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.225
Antoine.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.228
You all right?

28:13.817 --> 28:14.818
I'm fine.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.077
Renee!

28:32.836 --> 28:38.007
These walkies are old,
but the range isn't half bad.

28:40.885 --> 28:44.639
Any sign of trouble,
you radio immediately.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.727
-Okay?
-You do the same.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.271
Be careful out there.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.694
[Glenn] All right. Get a room, you kids.

29:03.032 --> 29:06.161
I'm freezing my ass off.
Are you sure this is a good idea?

29:06.244 --> 29:08.329
What if they're just leading us out here
to kill us?

29:08.413 --> 29:09.706
Well, we don't let our guard down.

29:10.457 --> 29:13.042
-Well, Glenn seems pretty sketch.
-Yeah.

29:13.126 --> 29:16.212
And Mark, "Mr. Wise Man On The Hill."

29:17.630 --> 29:19.591
You know he had one of his talks
with Andy, right?

29:19.674 --> 29:22.469
Yeah, and Susan too,
and they both wound up dead.

29:22.552 --> 29:23.845
What if it's him?

29:23.928 --> 29:27.766
Let's not forget "American Gothic 2.0,"
Renee and Antoine.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.643
What are they?
Brother/wife, sister/husband?

29:30.727 --> 29:33.772
Look, if we run into any trouble,
I've got my gun back.

29:34.522 --> 29:35.356
What? How?

29:36.065 --> 29:38.860
All that matters is that I got it back,
no thanks to you.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.023
[faint growling]

30:59.941 --> 31:00.817
What is that?

31:07.240 --> 31:09.158
-Fuck, it's not there.
-What's not in there?

31:09.242 --> 31:11.452
[walkie screeches]
Renee, this is Antoine. Is that you?

31:13.121 --> 31:14.497
[walkie squelches]

31:14.831 --> 31:17.584
-Shh.
-Seriously, what the fuck is going on?

31:18.459 --> 31:20.420
-[Dawn panting]
-[growling]

31:20.503 --> 31:21.880
What the fuck?

31:24.507 --> 31:25.383
[growling]

31:35.476 --> 31:36.728
[sighs]

31:37.937 --> 31:39.188
[Mark] What? What?

31:43.943 --> 31:45.361
[Mark] What is it?

31:46.404 --> 31:47.405
I think it's a wolf.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.493
Antoine, this is Renee. We heard you.

31:53.202 --> 31:54.662
[Antoine]
Keep your eyes open.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.664
[Renee] We're okay.
We're gonna keep going.

31:57.540 --> 31:58.750
[Antoine]  Be safe.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.549
[mutters]
Yeah, sure, let's follow the fucking wolf.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.237
[gasps]

33:08.861 --> 33:10.697
[panting]

33:29.424 --> 33:31.384
-Antoine, are you there?
-[Dawn] How much farther?

33:31.467 --> 33:33.845
-I think we're almost there.
-[Renee] Antoine.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.888
Come in, Antoine.
Can you hear me? Are you there?

33:38.349 --> 33:41.269
-Maybe his battery's dead.
-[Peter] Or we're out of range.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.312
Either way, the walkie is useless.

33:49.318 --> 33:51.279
[wincing]

34:09.922 --> 34:11.132
Note to self...

34:12.341 --> 34:14.594
try not to think about how many times

34:14.677 --> 34:17.680
big Glenn abused little Glenn
on this mattress.

34:20.683 --> 34:22.060
[winces]

34:22.143 --> 34:25.063
It's better than the floor, yeah.
[groans]

34:25.563 --> 34:27.315
[grunts] Oh!

34:27.940 --> 34:29.358
Ow.

34:30.234 --> 34:31.235
[sighs]

34:33.237 --> 34:34.447
Oh--!

34:34.530 --> 34:38.785
[panting]
Ibuprofen, I'm coming at ya.

34:41.412 --> 34:42.413
Ah.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.423
Who the fuck is Benny Ironside?

35:04.310 --> 35:06.020
[panting]

35:08.314 --> 35:09.315
Guys!

35:12.819 --> 35:13.820
[group panting]

35:17.990 --> 35:19.408
[bangs]

35:21.035 --> 35:22.078
A phone.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.123
[beeps]

35:27.583 --> 35:29.710
-It's dead.
-Maybe it just needs charging.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.880
-No, the phone's plugged in.
-Then why the fuck isn't it working?

35:32.964 --> 35:35.133
-How are we supposed to know that?
-Give me the keys to the SUV.

35:35.216 --> 35:36.259
-I'm gonna start it.
-Wait.

35:38.261 --> 35:40.054
Here's your explanation.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.265
Looks like Gene wasn't very good
at paying his bills, either.

35:42.348 --> 35:44.392
Who gives a fuck about the phone?

35:44.475 --> 35:46.477
Our way out of here
is right there with the SUV.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.316
Shoot.

35:53.442 --> 35:56.112
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Come on, come on, come on.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.364
-[Peter] It's not turning over.
-Yeah, I got that!

35:58.447 --> 35:59.907
Thank you for the fucking update!

35:59.991 --> 36:03.077
Come on, you dirty--
Motherfucker, God damn it!

36:03.161 --> 36:06.122
Glenn!
I really don't think that's gonna help.

36:07.081 --> 36:08.124
[mutters] Fuck you.

36:08.207 --> 36:09.417
The light was left on.

36:10.084 --> 36:12.378
-What fucking light?
-This one above the mirror.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.841
[Dawn's voice]  Great. I will be in the SUV
in the meantime.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.563
Which one of you fucking idiots...?

36:30.646 --> 36:31.647
Well, I didn't--

36:32.607 --> 36:35.193
Look, I was waiting for Noah
to get me a sweater, and--

36:36.736 --> 36:37.570
[sighs]

36:37.653 --> 36:40.114
You are not the sharpest knife
in the drawer, are you?

36:40.198 --> 36:41.282
Glenn, she didn't do it on purpose.

36:41.365 --> 36:43.784
You know that?
Do you fucking know that?

36:43.868 --> 36:46.704
She brought a gun,
and now the only vehicle is disabled.

36:46.787 --> 36:50.082
You know what, Glenn?
I keep trying to remind myself

36:50.166 --> 36:53.085
to see the scared little boy
inside of you that is lashing out

36:53.169 --> 36:54.170
because he's afraid.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.341
But I really don't think
that discharging your rage

36:58.424 --> 37:01.802
and your fear on others
is of service to anyone.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.347
Don't fucking talk to me
unless you're gonna speak English.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.182
Do you fucking understand me,  Kimosabe?

37:07.266 --> 37:09.810
Can we just find something to make
this trip back a little easier?

37:09.894 --> 37:10.978
Huh?

37:11.062 --> 37:12.021
[Mark] Renee's right.

37:13.731 --> 37:14.732
Fuck.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.864
[strumming]

37:23.491 --> 37:25.952
Renee, this is Antoine. Please respond.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.787
She hasn't answered you
in a long time, Antoine.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.455
She's probably out of range.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.250
I'll check the signal in the back.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.588
This guy's gotta chill out.

37:38.714 --> 37:42.510
Antoine's trying to control a situation
that he has no actual control over.

37:44.512 --> 37:45.346
Poor guy.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.809
Thanks for the soup, Judith.
It was really good.

37:51.435 --> 37:54.355
I'm freezing, so I'm gonna go grab
some wood and start a fire.

37:54.438 --> 37:57.692
-Well, shouldn't someone go with you?
-No, it should just take a second.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.360
You don't want a hand, Keira?

37:59.860 --> 38:02.196
[door opens, closes]

38:07.118 --> 38:08.160
What about you?

38:09.787 --> 38:11.956
Could I tempt you
with some of my world famous soup?

38:12.039 --> 38:15.251
No, I'm not really
a caramelized onion guy.

38:17.336 --> 38:18.671
I'll just have my grapes.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.343
Did you get my letter?

38:28.097 --> 38:29.473
Yes, I did. Thank you.

38:30.766 --> 38:34.270
Good.
Sometimes I think it's easier for me

38:34.353 --> 38:38.566
to write these feelings down
just to get it out,

38:38.649 --> 38:40.901
um, especially in a fish bowl
like this one.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.033
I'm glad you did.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.214
[walkie squelches]

39:13.017 --> 39:14.185
Hello?

39:26.614 --> 39:27.615
[screams]

39:36.665 --> 39:37.708
[Noah] What...?

39:39.919 --> 39:40.920
Is that...?

39:42.838 --> 39:45.841
Oh, fuck, man, that is.
That's a rotten fucking severed hand.

39:45.925 --> 39:49.053
-It's Talvinder's, obviously.
-You don't know that.

39:49.136 --> 39:51.764
[yells]
No more games!

39:53.516 --> 39:55.142
You're gonna tell us
what really happened to her.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.645
-How many times I gotta do this shit?
-Until you tell us the truth!

39:57.728 --> 40:00.689
I already told you what I know.
I didn't even know Talvinder was dead.

40:00.773 --> 40:02.691
Yeah, you and your friends
probably killed her with your own hands.

40:02.775 --> 40:05.444
You guys are supposed to go, like,
"Kumbaya" and "love thy neighbor,"

40:05.528 --> 40:08.155
but all you do is hurl accusations
and blame us for shit.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.659
Yeah, because every fucking thing
that's happened in the last 24 hours

40:11.742 --> 40:13.661
has been on you and your friends.

40:13.744 --> 40:14.870
-I don't need this.
-You're not going anywhere.

40:14.954 --> 40:18.165
-Man, get the fuck out of my face.
-Start talking, you piece of shit.

40:21.293 --> 40:23.045
-[gunshot echoes]
-That was a warning shot.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.423
Next one won't be a warning.
Just try me.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.633
Just try me, man, see what happens.

40:27.716 --> 40:29.009
Stay the fuck away from me or I'll shoot.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.803
-I just wanna talk to you, man.
-[Noah] Stay away!

40:30.886 --> 40:32.763
Look, you don't need to do that, Noah.

40:32.847 --> 40:36.392
I took a vow of non-violence, all right?

40:36.475 --> 40:39.687
I'm not gonna hurt you. We all did.
We're not gonna hurt you.

40:40.896 --> 40:43.524
-We just want the truth.
-But I already told you.

40:46.402 --> 40:47.570
[grunting]

40:48.863 --> 40:50.322
[Keira] Antoine, you can let him go!

40:52.324 --> 40:53.742
You're choking him to death!

40:55.953 --> 40:57.163
Antoine, that's enough!

41:02.084 --> 41:03.335
[groans]

41:04.003 --> 41:05.171
The truth.

41:05.671 --> 41:06.714
Now!

41:06.797 --> 41:08.966
I'll tell you the truth.
It was Owen Turnbull.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.928
-Who's Owen Turnbull?
-He went to our camp, okay?

41:13.012 --> 41:15.139
He was a really creepy guy
obsessed with Talvinder.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.182
He never left her side.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.476
Okay, when Talvinder went missing,

41:18.559 --> 41:20.895
you didn't have to be fucking Sherlock
to know who did it.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.730
So you think this Owen guy killed her?

41:22.813 --> 41:26.025
Everyone did, including the cops.
They just couldn't find the body.

41:26.108 --> 41:28.944
It's been five years without an answer.

41:29.862 --> 41:32.198
We figured Owen dumped the body
somewhere in the area.

41:32.281 --> 41:33.991
We just came back to look.

41:34.575 --> 41:35.784
Why now?

41:36.410 --> 41:38.621
Why now? It's the fucking dead of winter!

41:42.458 --> 41:43.626
What the hell is going on?!

41:49.632 --> 41:51.050
[panting]

41:52.676 --> 41:53.969
[gasps]

42:08.526 --> 42:10.819
This house was supposed to be
a peaceful haven.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.698
Now it's become a war zone.

42:18.744 --> 42:22.540
It's affecting us all,
this fear and hatred and violence.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.335
Anyone can take a life...

42:28.337 --> 42:30.089
given the circumstances.

42:33.968 --> 42:35.678
I have to get rid of her body.

42:36.637 --> 42:37.721
The killer already found it.

42:37.805 --> 42:40.724
If it's not in the shed I'll keep looking,
and it goes in the lake.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.768
-I should go with you.
-No, you're exhausted.

42:42.851 --> 42:44.186
No, I'm fine.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.398
It would be less suspicious if I go alone.

42:48.023 --> 42:49.858
Besides, I won't be alone. I'll have this.

42:49.942 --> 42:52.069
-No, please let me come with you.
-No.

42:52.152 --> 42:53.988
How do we face our problems?

43:01.161 --> 43:03.080
How do we face our problems?

43:11.297 --> 43:13.215
Could I talk to you for a minute?

43:13.299 --> 43:15.759
Oh, Judith,
this isn't the best time right now.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.553
-I'm sorry.
-It won't take long.

43:22.057 --> 43:23.809
Earlier in the kitchen...

43:25.144 --> 43:28.897
I saw you.
I don't wanna say you were spying.

43:28.981 --> 43:33.110
I just-- I feel like this is...
a much bigger conversation.

43:33.193 --> 43:35.696
Maybe later you, me and Renee
can sit down and--

43:35.779 --> 43:38.032
I don't want to involve Renee.
I wanna hear from you.

43:43.078 --> 43:44.079
Okay.

43:46.749 --> 43:52.713
Listen, we're all feeling
a lot of helplessness right now.

43:52.796 --> 43:57.051
a lot of fear, and these are powerful,
powerful emotions.

43:58.510 --> 44:01.847
It can easily make us
lose our center and...

44:03.015 --> 44:07.853
cause us to do things to help us escape

44:07.936 --> 44:09.605
from the things
that are happening around us.

44:13.776 --> 44:15.653
I didn't want to embarrass you, Judith.

44:17.321 --> 44:18.656
I'm sure it's harmless.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.285
Thank you, Antoine.

44:23.369 --> 44:24.536
Thank you.

44:45.391 --> 44:47.476
Okay, you stole my gun
and now they have it again.

44:47.559 --> 44:48.894
What the hell, Noah?

44:49.520 --> 44:52.147
How else was I supposed
to defend myself in my crippled state?

44:52.231 --> 44:54.441
How do you expect anyone
to trust you when you pull this shit?

44:56.068 --> 44:57.736
You guys are just so against me.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.113
I think you always have been.

44:59.863 --> 45:02.574
You even blame me for Talvinder. Admit it.

45:07.788 --> 45:08.789
Yeah.

45:09.957 --> 45:12.918
I knew it, I knew it.
I knew you blame me.

45:13.001 --> 45:14.753
Noah, we're marked for death,

45:14.837 --> 45:16.880
so what you need to do
is stop worrying about the past

45:16.964 --> 45:18.757
and start worrying
about surviving the present.

45:18.841 --> 45:20.926
'Cause that's what this is about
right now.

45:21.009 --> 45:22.344
Survival.

45:30.894 --> 45:32.479
[whispers]
What'd you tell 'em?

45:32.563 --> 45:33.730
The official story.

45:34.898 --> 45:37.025
Crazy Owen killed her.

45:37.109 --> 45:40.737
No body was found,
and we came back here looking for answers.

45:40.821 --> 45:43.907
-Did they believe it?
-They don't believe anything we say.

45:45.284 --> 45:47.578
They hate our guts. This is war.

45:49.746 --> 45:52.624
We cannot be at war with them
if we're going to survive this.

45:56.962 --> 45:59.131
-Hey, if you're going by the kitchen--
-No.

45:59.214 --> 46:01.550
I just want a snack. I'm so hungry.

46:01.633 --> 46:02.885
[sighs]

46:37.920 --> 46:39.087
[lid thumps]

46:40.464 --> 46:41.632
No.

46:42.007 --> 46:43.425
No, no, no, no, no.

46:44.009 --> 46:45.344
No, no, no, no...

46:52.392 --> 46:53.602
[grunts]

46:54.436 --> 46:56.063
[Antoine screaming]
No! No!

46:57.272 --> 46:58.273
[groans]

47:02.694 --> 47:04.196
No! Please...!

47:04.279 --> 47:05.572
Don't...

47:05.656 --> 47:06.698
Don't!

47:07.449 --> 47:09.201
No!

47:09.451 --> 47:10.452
[screams]

47:13.455 --> 47:14.331
[Antoine screaming]

47:15.958 --> 47:18.168
-[whirrs]
-[screaming]

47:20.629 --> 47:21.838
No!

47:24.216 --> 47:25.509
[screaming]

47:32.307 --> 47:34.142
[screaming]

47:46.363 --> 47:47.364
Hey.

47:48.824 --> 47:50.576
Hey, "Benny."

47:52.244 --> 47:53.120
What'd you call me?

47:55.080 --> 47:57.207
You know, my foot was killing me.

47:57.291 --> 47:59.459
I hope you don't mind,
I just went back in your drawer

47:59.543 --> 48:00.961
for some more aspirin, and...

48:02.087 --> 48:04.798
I found that prescription
to Benny Ironside.

48:06.091 --> 48:09.595
And I got to thinking either you took that
from some guy named Benny...

48:09.678 --> 48:10.637
Hm.

48:11.555 --> 48:12.889
...or you are Benny.

48:14.057 --> 48:16.560
And you're here
under some false pretenses.

48:17.019 --> 48:18.645
Mm.

48:18.895 --> 48:22.774
Well, unfortunately,
I don't have to explain shit to you, do I?

48:22.858 --> 48:25.110
[laughing]
No, you're totally right. You don't.

48:26.236 --> 48:28.280
Let's go see what Antoine
and Renee have to say

48:28.363 --> 48:30.532
about your little contraband pharmacy.

48:33.952 --> 48:34.911
It's warfarin.

48:35.495 --> 48:38.248
They use it to treat
blood clot disorders of the lungs.

48:39.666 --> 48:42.836
It's a life-saving drug, but it is
out of this world expensive, okay?

48:44.630 --> 48:45.672
So then you stole it.

48:45.756 --> 48:47.924
No, a compassion clinic gave them to me.

48:48.008 --> 48:50.677
They give expensive drugs
to people who can't afford them.

48:50.761 --> 48:52.012
But because it's slightly illegal

48:52.095 --> 48:53.597
they put random names
on the prescriptions,

48:53.680 --> 48:56.642
so there's no paper trail.
Okay? You happy?

49:02.898 --> 49:04.900
[chuckles] Wow.

49:07.527 --> 49:09.404
Yeah, that was almost plausible, man.

49:09.488 --> 49:11.323
I mean, you're pretty quick
for such a big dude.

49:11.406 --> 49:13.909
You're lucky I like you
so I'm gonna let this slide.

49:13.992 --> 49:17.496
But do not mistake my kindness
for weakness.

49:17.579 --> 49:19.206
You poke around in my shit again,

49:21.041 --> 49:24.044
-and you'll be very, very sorry.
-[slams]

49:39.976 --> 49:40.977
Hey.

49:42.646 --> 49:45.732
Do you mind if I chill in here? I just...

49:47.818 --> 49:49.986
I just gotta, you know, clear my head.

49:51.613 --> 49:53.448
I won't make any noise, I promise.

49:54.199 --> 49:55.909
You being here is enough to bother me.

49:59.329 --> 50:03.667
Okay, I get it.
You're... you're pissed, right?

50:03.750 --> 50:05.794
At me and Noah and Dawn.

50:05.877 --> 50:07.713
I'm a little bit more than pissed.

50:10.257 --> 50:11.633
[Peter] We messed up.

50:14.928 --> 50:17.723
We should've told you guys
about Talvinder way before.

50:21.518 --> 50:22.728
We were scared.

50:25.063 --> 50:26.106
She's scared.

50:27.149 --> 50:29.276
Not thinking straight,
and not knowing who to trust.

50:31.653 --> 50:36.158
[sighs]
But that doesn't make it right.

50:37.409 --> 50:39.119
And I didn't come here to make excuses.

50:41.413 --> 50:42.914
I just want to tell you the truth.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.126
From now on, no more lies.

50:47.753 --> 50:49.671
Don't make promises you can't keep.
