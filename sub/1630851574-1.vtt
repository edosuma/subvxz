00:38.073 --> 00:41.776
<i>This is a picture of the American dream.</i>

00:56.391 --> 00:59.961
<i>This is a picture of what
the dream once was.</i>

01:03.832 --> 01:07.068
<i>This is a picture of what
the dream has become.</i>

01:09.337 --> 01:11.706
<i>At the center of prime-time television</i>

01:11.806 --> 01:14.609
<i>has been the selling of the dream.</i>

01:14.709 --> 01:19.414
<i>And at the heart of the dream,
the mythic American family.</i>

01:28.690 --> 01:32.393
<i>Once an outsider,
the African American is now</i>

01:32.494 --> 01:34.262
<i>part of this family,</i>

01:34.362 --> 01:35.730
<i>part of the myth.</i>

01:38.500 --> 01:41.002
<i>Through television, if nowhere else,</i>

01:41.102 --> 01:45.473
<i>we are now watched and welcome
in the majority of American homes.</i>

01:47.809 --> 01:52.013
<i>But what was the key to the households
of prime-time America,</i>

01:52.113 --> 01:54.082
<i>the key to our inclusion</i>

01:54.182 --> 01:56.951
<i>in the myth of the American dream?</i>

02:27.048 --> 02:32.720
As Blacks returned
from a war that they fought

02:32.821 --> 02:34.589
to give other peoples freedoms

02:34.689 --> 02:38.993
that were not allowed to them
in their own country,

02:39.093 --> 02:41.896
Blacks became more determined to...

02:45.867 --> 02:48.102
get some of what I gave my life for.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.543
I think the mood
in Black America after World War II

02:55.643 --> 02:58.479
was cautious optimism.

02:58.580 --> 03:00.381
The military had just been integrated,

03:00.481 --> 03:03.451
you know, as a result of that war,

03:03.551 --> 03:05.086
and allowed Black soldiers in.

03:05.186 --> 03:09.490
On the other hand, I think there was still
this caution about racial hostility.

03:12.293 --> 03:15.997
There was a great deal
of anticipation on the part,

03:16.097 --> 03:19.100
not only of the soldiers
returning from World War II,

03:19.200 --> 03:22.370
but as well on the women and men

03:22.470 --> 03:25.773
who worked in the defense industry
during the war.

03:25.874 --> 03:28.910
They had had opportunities

03:29.010 --> 03:31.779
that had been unavailable to them
prior to the war

03:31.880 --> 03:33.948
because of the demand for their labor.

03:38.219 --> 03:42.891
So that you had
a highly trained ex-military class...

03:44.025 --> 03:48.696
and then you had people
who were formerly domestics, often,

03:48.796 --> 03:52.100
who had experienced industrial life,

03:52.200 --> 03:57.972
so that they were poised for life
fully in the 20th century,

03:58.072 --> 04:00.942
a life that had been experienced
by other Americans

04:01.042 --> 04:03.544
but which, of course,
had been denied to Black people.

04:24.232 --> 04:26.234
<i>Our optimism after the war</i>

04:26.334 --> 04:31.706
<i>coincided with the celebration
of a new, infant technology in America.</i>

04:36.477 --> 04:38.346
<i>After ten years of experiments,</i>

04:38.446 --> 04:41.983
<i>the public at last gets
a preview of television.</i>

04:46.354 --> 04:49.924
<i>Race relations and television
formed a critical link.</i>

04:51.793 --> 04:53.661
<i>And so a new industry</i>

04:53.761 --> 04:55.997
<i>steps out of the laboratory
into the limelight,</i>

04:56.097 --> 04:59.133
<i>as television makes its bow
to the American public.</i>

04:59.233 --> 05:01.636
<i>Where it will go from here
is any man's guess.</i>

05:04.205 --> 05:06.507
The white man, the Negro, the Oriental,

05:06.607 --> 05:08.609
the Protestant, the Catholic, the Jew,

05:08.710 --> 05:11.112
they've all shared the spotlight
on this stage.

05:11.212 --> 05:13.781
Well, Danny, if I may inject,

05:13.881 --> 05:16.517
that's the way show business operates.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.487
Danny, there's no room for prejudice
in our profession.

05:19.587 --> 05:20.555
We entertainers...

05:20.655 --> 05:23.725
Television in the early days
was a medium trying to find itself.

05:23.825 --> 05:27.095
It was a medium that was perched
to really make a difference,

05:27.195 --> 05:30.431
but the kind of difference that it
could make was really to be proven.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.468
The format of radio at that time
was you had,

05:33.568 --> 05:37.438
you know, the evening programs,
dramatic shows,

05:37.538 --> 05:40.074
westerns, comedies.

05:40.174 --> 05:43.077
So television was a natural extension.

05:43.177 --> 05:46.748
They just took those ideas and
brought them to pictures instead of sound.

05:48.516 --> 05:52.720
And to that extent, then, I think
Black folks' representations in television

05:52.820 --> 05:55.957
were very much inherited from radio.

05:56.057 --> 05:57.992
And, of course, that gets us into

05:58.092 --> 06:01.462
the old <i>Amos 'n Andy</i> sorts
of situation comedies.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.365
<i>You know, of course,
that there's a shortage of women.</i>

06:04.465 --> 06:07.602
<i>I'll say. The one I took out
last night only come up to my belt buckle!</i>

06:09.437 --> 06:12.373
And, of course, in radio,
it was two white characters

06:12.473 --> 06:15.676
who came up with the idea
and who impersonated Blacks.

06:15.777 --> 06:17.445
Who's scared? Me?

06:17.512 --> 06:18.946
Ha ha ha!

06:19.047 --> 06:21.215
And by the time
it came over to television,

06:21.315 --> 06:24.585
of course, they had to assemble
an entire Black cast.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.454
If you don't give me my money back,

06:26.554 --> 06:28.189
I'm gonna punch you in each eye!

06:28.289 --> 06:29.957
Then I'm going to punch you in the mouth.

06:30.058 --> 06:32.026
Then I'm going to take a stick
and crack your head!

06:32.126 --> 06:34.629
In other words, I'm gonna open
everything that's closed,

06:34.729 --> 06:36.030
and close everything that's open!

06:36.130 --> 06:37.632
Take it easy, Andy!

06:37.732 --> 06:39.500
Well, to say that
<i>The Amos 'n Andy Show</i>

06:39.600 --> 06:43.204
was popular in its day
is a shocking understatement.

06:43.304 --> 06:46.974
It was enormously, indescribably popular,

06:47.075 --> 06:50.645
and also, indescribably primitive

06:50.745 --> 06:53.247
in its use of stereotypes and clichés.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.583
It's about time you met some decent people

06:55.683 --> 06:58.119
instead of that horrible, uncouth group
you associate with.

06:58.219 --> 07:01.422
Well, I done met all
the accomplished people I wanna know.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.191
Like Andrew Brown, for instance.

07:03.291 --> 07:05.226
Yeah, like Andrew Brown.

07:05.326 --> 07:08.729
Well, what, may I ask,
has he ever accomplished?

07:08.830 --> 07:10.498
Well, he, uh...

07:11.199 --> 07:15.403
Just yesterday, he had a run
of 13 balls in the side pocket

07:15.503 --> 07:17.605
without once leaning on the pool table.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.842
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

07:20.942 --> 07:22.977
Andrew hanging over a pool table.

07:23.077 --> 07:24.912
You'd never find him in a public library.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.849
No, they ain't got no pool tables
in there.

07:27.949 --> 07:29.851
A composite of all the clichés

07:29.951 --> 07:33.721
about lazy Black men
and about opportunistic Black men.

07:33.821 --> 07:38.826
In those days, it was taken for granted
that the portrayal of characters,

07:38.926 --> 07:43.431
as they chose to portray them,
was audience-pleasing.

07:43.531 --> 07:47.101
And we're in the business
of pleasing audiences, so we did it.

07:47.835 --> 07:51.072
At home, it was very important

07:51.172 --> 07:54.442
that we not watch <i>Amos 'n Andy.</i>

07:55.243 --> 07:59.514
It was very important to my mother
that I should not see

07:59.614 --> 08:01.149
something that was so racist.

08:01.249 --> 08:05.253
Why, you ain't got sense enough
to come in out of the rain!

08:05.353 --> 08:07.722
I is too. I's done it lots of times.

08:09.390 --> 08:11.292
It was years later
that I realized

08:11.392 --> 08:13.561
that <i>Amos 'n Andy</i> are brilliant.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.829
They were really funny.

08:14.896 --> 08:15.897
Andy!

08:16.764 --> 08:18.466
Now, ya see, Andy, first,

08:18.566 --> 08:21.602
the atom splits
into what they call the monocle.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.305
And then the monocle busts and breaks down

08:24.405 --> 08:27.608
into what they call neutrons, "po-trons,"
Fig Newtons and morons.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.541
<i>The struggle
to end Jim Crow segregation</i>

09:00.641 --> 09:04.111
<i>and the portrayal of Blacks
as second-class citizens</i>

09:04.212 --> 09:07.215
<i>inevitably took television to task.</i>

09:07.315 --> 09:09.984
Hi, partner! Here, Andy. Hold this.

09:10.084 --> 09:13.187
When we think of this group of people

09:13.287 --> 09:17.191
whose historical experience
had been transformed by the war,

09:17.291 --> 09:20.962
poised for full integration
into the American society,

09:21.062 --> 09:23.598
and then we think about
what they were greeted with

09:23.698 --> 09:26.767
as television made its debut,

09:28.102 --> 09:32.673
they were greeted with
images of a fully autonomous,

09:32.773 --> 09:35.376
segregated, separate Black community,

09:35.476 --> 09:38.980
which was the community
in which <i>Amos 'n Andy</i> thrived.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.148
Quiet, please!

09:41.249 --> 09:45.453
<i>The first prime time
television show to feature a Black cast,</i>

09:45.553 --> 09:48.823
Amos 'n Andy <i>played on a familiar theme.</i>

09:48.923 --> 09:52.493
<i>Blacks might aspire
to the American dream of success,</i>

09:52.593 --> 09:56.631
<i>but we were continually,
comically ill-equipped to achieve it.</i>

09:57.865 --> 10:00.268
Why couldn't I have been a doctor
like you two guys?

10:00.368 --> 10:02.103
Because there ain't
no uniforms that fit you.

10:02.203 --> 10:04.238
Just shut your big mouth and come on!

10:05.239 --> 10:08.809
<i>Even before its premiere,
the show was sued by the NAACP</i>

10:08.909 --> 10:10.678
<i>to block its broadcast.</i>

10:10.778 --> 10:15.816
<i>The suit charged, "Every character
is either a clown or a crook.</i>

10:15.916 --> 10:19.387
<i>Millions of white Americans see
this</i> Amos 'n Andy <i>picture</i>

10:19.487 --> 10:21.822
<i>and think the entire race is the same."</i>

10:21.922 --> 10:23.724
Oh, no, no, Andy, I don't think you —

10:23.824 --> 10:27.361
So that the interests
of the Black community

10:27.461 --> 10:29.897
and the images fed
to that Black community,

10:29.997 --> 10:33.768
and to the larger American society
in the early 1950s,

10:33.868 --> 10:35.770
were diametrically opposed to each other.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.840
<i>Two seasons after its debut,</i>

10:39.940 --> 10:42.109
Amos 'n Andy <i>was canceled.</i>

10:43.944 --> 10:46.781
<i>The nation was heading toward a new era.</i>

10:48.282 --> 10:53.521
<i>Yet television for the most part,
throughout the '50s, failed to adjust.</i>

10:57.325 --> 11:00.861
<i>In the cultural landscape
of prime-time America,</i>

11:00.961 --> 11:04.231
<i>Negroes remained in their place.</i>

11:05.166 --> 11:07.435
Biaku, Wanaba.

11:07.535 --> 11:09.403
<i>Jambo, jambo,</i> bwana.

11:12.573 --> 11:15.643
Hold it, Mr. Erwin.
Something's gone wrong!

11:15.743 --> 11:18.312
Watch it! Watch it, Willie!

11:19.613 --> 11:21.115
Oh!

11:21.182 --> 11:22.249
Whoa!

11:22.350 --> 11:24.085
- Whoa!
- Oh, Willie!

11:28.289 --> 11:31.592
I don't think that
the sponsor or the network,

11:31.692 --> 11:34.195
and certainly not the writers,

11:34.295 --> 11:38.666
ever considered
the questions of race relations,

11:38.766 --> 11:41.302
of stereotyping, et cetera.

11:41.402 --> 11:44.705
That was the farthest from our minds.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.775
Uh, again, what we were trying to do

11:47.875 --> 11:52.646
was to present
an amusing set of characters

11:52.747 --> 11:58.552
in as amusing a background
as we possibly could,

11:58.652 --> 12:00.287
doing amusing things

12:00.388 --> 12:03.491
to entice that audience
to come back next week.

12:07.428 --> 12:09.063
The Beulah Show,

12:09.163 --> 12:13.667
<i>brought to you by new milder Dreft,
for dishes and fine washables,</i>

12:13.768 --> 12:16.837
<i>and deep-cleaning Oxydol

12:17.705 --> 12:20.107
<i>Starring Louise Beavers as —</i>

12:20.174 --> 12:21.475
Beulah.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.711
If marriages are made in heaven,

12:23.811 --> 12:27.915
my guardian angel
has sure been loafing on the job.

12:31.085 --> 12:36.590
I think <i>Beulah</i> was popular
because she almost idealized

12:36.690 --> 12:40.861
what every person
would love to have in a housekeeper.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.498
They thought, "God, if we could get
a Beulah to run our house,

12:44.598 --> 12:48.302
this house would be much better off
than it was."

12:50.237 --> 12:51.806
The Hendersons' residence.

12:51.906 --> 12:53.174
<i>This is Mrs. Harrington...</i>

12:53.274 --> 12:57.178
<i>But in this idealized dream
of the American family,</i>

12:57.278 --> 12:58.979
<i>what of Beulah herself?</i>

12:59.079 --> 13:00.981
<i>Would she be better off?</i>

13:01.081 --> 13:03.984
Gosh, Beulah, I'm gonna have to dance

13:04.084 --> 13:07.087
in front of Mom and Dad and everyone.

13:07.188 --> 13:08.856
That's easy. What's bothering you?

13:08.956 --> 13:10.591
I just can't dance!

13:10.691 --> 13:13.294
Well, that's easy to fix. I'll teach you.

13:13.394 --> 13:15.729
Jeepers, Beulah, can you dance?

13:15.830 --> 13:17.198
Can I dance?

13:17.298 --> 13:21.168
Donnie, when the beat's right,
I just take off!

13:28.509 --> 13:31.479
You make her so happy in it...

13:33.080 --> 13:37.885
and you made her
so unaware of her own children

13:37.985 --> 13:41.522
and so aware of somebody else's children.

13:41.622 --> 13:43.724
That is a Hollywood maid.

13:44.692 --> 13:48.395
I knew a lot of people
who worked as domestics...

13:49.396 --> 13:53.501
and I know people who had
to educate their children

13:54.502 --> 13:57.371
from their earnings as a domestic,

13:57.471 --> 13:59.974
and they did it because
they didn't want their children

14:00.074 --> 14:02.743
to go through what they
were going through.

14:02.810 --> 14:04.578
Noble.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.747
That's nobility.

14:30.604 --> 14:33.440
<i>The nobility
of our historic dream of freedom</i>

14:33.541 --> 14:36.644
<i>and the dream of race relations

15:32.466 --> 15:35.536

Through the late '40s and '50s
on television,

16:44.505 --> 16:46.473
it's as though Black people didn't exist.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.743
You know, night after night,
there were programs,

16:49.843 --> 16:54.715

17:22.810 --> 17:25.312
Somebody would yell
or we would know through the grapevine

17:25.412 --> 17:28.649
that some Black person was going to be on
television that night, and we watched it.

17:28.749 --> 17:29.983
The rest of it we didn't watch.

17:30.084 --> 17:32.953
There was nothing that related to us
or we could relate to,

17:33.053 --> 17:34.655
so we didn't watch it.

17:34.755 --> 17:39.593
I can remember my mother
and my aunts and my neighbors,

17:39.693 --> 17:42.629
if they heard that a Black person
was going to be on television,

17:42.730 --> 17:45.065
or if they saw one come on the screen,

17:45.165 --> 17:48.402
they would dash to the phone
and start calling each other,

17:48.502 --> 17:52.539
so that the neighbors
and the aunts wouldn't miss it.

17:52.639 --> 17:56.143
My mother wouldn't call
long distance on the phone

17:56.243 --> 17:57.945
if there was a death in the family,

17:58.045 --> 18:02.049
but she would call my sister far away
to tell her that she'd heard

18:02.149 --> 18:06.019
that Cicely Tyson was going to be
on a program, for example,

18:06.120 --> 18:08.789
because it was such
a source of pride for them,

18:08.889 --> 18:11.892

18:14.495 --> 18:18.699
There was such a void
in the magazines and on the radio,

18:18.799 --> 18:23.737
so rare to see African American people
depicted anywhere,

18:23.837 --> 18:25.339

20:46.680 --> 20:49.716
King Cole was
a major breakthrough in the sense that

20:49.816 --> 20:53.420
Black people were
in charge of representing

20:53.520 --> 20:57.257
the culture and music

20:57.357 --> 21:00.260
um, in a way that wasn't
so much rooted in humor.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.462
It wasn't so much rooted in comedy.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.097
Well, the composer of that song,

21:04.197 --> 21:07.768
who was so widely unknown
14 years ago, is our guest tonight.

21:07.868 --> 21:11.138
And here he is,
my good friend Frankie Laine!

21:13.507 --> 21:17.544
Nat King Cole, I think,
appealed to a broad spectrum of people

21:17.644 --> 21:19.513
because he didn't seem threatening.

21:19.613 --> 21:21.181
He didn't, um...

21:22.115 --> 21:25.118
He didn't seem forceful

21:25.218 --> 21:28.322
or belligerent or anything
that would make, say,

21:28.422 --> 21:30.290
white people uncomfortable.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.002
I think that many...

21:42.703 --> 21:45.906
um, of the minorities involved

21:46.006 --> 21:49.409
in this profession during that period

21:49.509 --> 21:51.678
are guilty of something

21:51.778 --> 21:56.016
that, um, we had to do for survival,

21:56.116 --> 21:58.352
and that's called adjustments.

21:58.452 --> 22:01.688
We had to make adjustments
in our mind constantly

22:01.788 --> 22:05.926
in order to stay away
from the area of anger

22:06.026 --> 22:09.062
and, uh, "What's wrong with me?"

22:14.234 --> 22:17.871
As a man who wrote, produced
and directed this television show,

22:17.971 --> 22:21.241
the feedback I would get occasionally

22:21.341 --> 22:26.113
was that he had wide acceptance
in the white area

22:26.213 --> 22:29.449
because he was a gentleman.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.951
I'd hear that a lot.

22:31.051 --> 22:35.689
They said he was the kind of guy
that you could welcome into your home.

22:35.789 --> 22:37.824
He was just a gentleman.

22:38.692 --> 22:41.461
<i>If any one Black performer of the time</i>

22:41.561 --> 22:44.865

23:03.717 --> 23:07.988
<i>Would prime-time America

Two, four, six, eight,

23:16.596 --> 23:19.599
Why don't you
tell the niggers to go home?

23:23.804 --> 23:28.642
In 1957, the same time
Nat King Cole was on television,

23:28.742 --> 23:31.611
Black children in Little Rock, Arkansas
are trying to go to school

23:31.711 --> 23:34.014
and meeting with
a great deal of resistance

23:34.114 --> 23:36.750
on the part of
the white political structure

23:36.850 --> 23:39.786
that is supposed to enforce their rights.

23:52.466 --> 23:56.236
Don't stop! Just keep coming!
Don't allow them to teach the niggers!

24:01.208 --> 24:03.009
King Cole was very threatening.

24:03.110 --> 24:07.147
"How dare you bring
a Black man into our homes

24:07.247 --> 24:09.916
and into our communities
with white guests, no less,

24:10.016 --> 24:12.719
with white women, no less,
with white men, no less."

24:12.819 --> 24:14.721
"They're trying to go to our schools.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.124
Now look. They have a television show?"

24:17.891 --> 24:20.827
So it became impossible

24:20.927 --> 24:24.731
for the producers
of <i>The Nat King Cole Show</i>

24:24.831 --> 24:28.335
to find a sponsor
willing to underwrite that program.

24:28.435 --> 24:33.006
They did not want to alienate
their Southern constituency.

24:35.375 --> 24:36.843
- You're beautiful.
- You too!

24:36.943 --> 24:38.044
I had fun!

24:38.145 --> 24:42.282
<i>The reality of race relations
had reframed television,</i>

24:42.382 --> 24:46.353
<i>making an otherwise
acceptable image taboo.</i>

24:47.154 --> 24:49.456
<i>Unable to find a national sponsor,</i>

24:49.556 --> 24:53.226
The Nat King Cole Show
<i>ended after one season.</i>

25:06.773 --> 25:09.776
I think it was Sam Goldwyn who once said,

25:09.876 --> 25:12.145
when he was criticized about some of the —

25:12.245 --> 25:16.550
why he didn't do shows
of a more sociological import, he said...

25:17.651 --> 25:20.320
"If I want to send a message,
I'll call Western Union."

25:21.254 --> 25:24.758
Uh, the networks, the sponsors,

25:24.858 --> 25:28.428
they just want to get
good ratings, high ratings.

25:28.528 --> 25:32.666
High ratings — good for NBC
and it sells product.

25:32.766 --> 25:36.703
'Cause ultimately, let's face it,
television is a commercial industry.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.171
The society moves like this

25:38.271 --> 25:40.473
and television moves
a little behind it all the time.

25:40.574 --> 25:44.110
It's never gonna lead it.
It's always gonna follow it.

25:44.211 --> 25:48.014
Because it's a sponsored, uh, medium.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.483
<i>Just out and just wonderful,</i>

25:50.584 --> 25:53.386
<i>the 1957 Chevrolet.</i>

25:53.486 --> 25:56.423
The theory is
when a sponsor advertised a show,

25:56.523 --> 25:59.025
it's to sell the product, period.

25:59.125 --> 26:02.162
He doesn't care what —
You can put a test pattern on.

26:02.262 --> 26:05.298
If a lot of people will watch it,
he'll put his commercials in it.

26:05.398 --> 26:09.069
So that if somebody feels,

26:09.169 --> 26:11.571
by putting a commercial
on a television program

26:11.671 --> 26:13.473
that has some controversy to it —

26:13.573 --> 26:16.142
this is early on in television —
it may affect their product.

26:16.243 --> 26:18.044
They didn't buy anything with controversy.

26:18.645 --> 26:22.082
Broadcasting cannot continue
to live by the numbers.

26:23.483 --> 26:27.053
Ratings ought to be the slave
of the broadcaster, not his master.

26:27.687 --> 26:32.559
You must provide a wider range of choices,
more diversity, more alternatives.

26:33.593 --> 26:38.798
It is not enough
to cater to the nation's whims.

26:38.898 --> 26:42.335
You must also serve the nation's needs.

26:45.005 --> 26:47.140
<i>The networks were predictably slow</i>

26:47.240 --> 26:49.976
<i>to take up this challenge

26:50.076 --> 26:52.979
<i>but in the prime time arena

27:16.002 --> 27:17.570
Precisely in this period,

27:17.671 --> 27:20.073
the images of Black people
dominated the news,

27:20.173 --> 27:24.110
and they were images of,

27:24.210 --> 27:30.116
on the one hand, Black men and women
being tortured and beaten and abused

27:30.216 --> 27:33.186
and whose rights
were being systematically violated.

27:33.887 --> 27:38.658
On the other hand,
there was a certain nobility of spirit,

27:38.758 --> 27:42.329
and no one knew
what to do with Black people

27:42.429 --> 27:46.599
in terms of representing them
in a TV series.

27:49.502 --> 27:52.005
So this afternoon, I have a dream.

27:52.105 --> 27:54.908
It is a dream deeply rooted
in the American dream.

27:55.008 --> 27:56.843
I have a dream that one day...

27:56.943 --> 27:59.813
There was so much possible.

28:00.980 --> 28:05.218
And there was, at the same time,
so much fear and so much violence.

28:06.052 --> 28:09.989
And out of this pressure
that was brought to bear

28:10.090 --> 28:14.461
by the civil rights movement on
the structures of the South particularly,

28:14.561 --> 28:17.364
um, there was the potential for a new day,

28:17.464 --> 28:21.067
and everybody knew it
because it was on television.

29:09.749 --> 29:12.552
That was a turning point,
an important turning point

29:12.652 --> 29:15.522
to mobilize and get
the sympathies of whites

29:15.622 --> 29:17.824
who started to see the brutality,

29:17.924 --> 29:21.761
who started to actually see
the deep resistance

29:21.861 --> 29:26.099
to essentially Black enfranchisement
into the society.

29:26.199 --> 29:29.269
And I think the spillover that it had was

29:29.369 --> 29:33.706
to at least raise the question of absence

29:33.807 --> 29:36.409
of Black representations on television,

29:36.509 --> 29:40.180
or at least raise the question of
to what extent did television

29:40.280 --> 29:43.883
have some responsibility
to try to participate

29:43.983 --> 29:45.752

Hey, you! Hey, hey, cab!

31:11.137 --> 31:14.908
Hey, stop, will ya?
Come on, stop, man! Hey!

31:15.608 --> 31:18.745
Hey, cab! Man, will you stop over here?

31:19.479 --> 31:22.682
<i>There were no
neat resolutions in the show,</i>

31:22.782 --> 31:27.220
<i>no happy endings, no sentimental songs
or canned laughter.</i>

31:27.320 --> 31:28.521
What do you mean?

31:28.621 --> 31:31.491
<i>In one episode, the show even challenged</i>

31:31.591 --> 31:35.028
<i>the unspoken assumptions
behind American integration.</i>

31:35.128 --> 31:38.131
Oh, come on, now,
he's a perfectly nice old man, but —

31:38.231 --> 31:41.768
But you wanted a white Negro
and you got a Black one.

31:41.868 --> 31:45.038
The Negroes have a right
to move in under the Constitution.

31:45.138 --> 31:47.807
The only thing is, what kind of a Negro?

31:47.907 --> 31:51.311
I'm telling you,
he isn't the type for this community.

31:52.245 --> 31:54.914
What if he were white? Come on.

31:56.149 --> 31:58.751
A rough, uneducated, decent sort of a guy
who made it the hard way.

31:58.851 --> 32:00.687
A guy who could
never be your particular friend.

32:00.787 --> 32:02.922
Is that any reason
for keeping him out of here?

32:05.124 --> 32:08.227
We have a different yardstick
for measuring a Negro, don't we?

32:09.896 --> 32:11.598
If he went to Harvard...

32:12.599 --> 32:14.100
if he plays golf...

32:16.102 --> 32:19.038
if he looks like a Boston gentleman
and talks like a Philadelphia lawyer,

32:19.138 --> 32:21.240
why, fine, let him be brown.

32:21.341 --> 32:22.709
Only not too brown.

32:22.809 --> 32:24.944
Yeah, your husband believes in equality...

32:25.845 --> 32:27.447
but —

32:27.547 --> 32:29.749
Mr. Adams is the "but."

32:29.816 --> 32:30.917
Neil, I —

32:30.984 --> 32:31.985
No, no.

32:35.254 --> 32:36.756
I'll see you around.

32:37.857 --> 32:41.227
<i>Boldly bucking
prime-time convention,</i>

32:41.327 --> 32:45.832
<i>the show repeatedly undercut
the myth of American progress.</i>

32:46.866 --> 32:50.603
East Side/West Side
<i>was canceled after one season.</i>

32:55.642 --> 33:00.713
<i>Still, prime time was faced with adjusting
to the continuing civil rights struggle.</i>

33:02.749 --> 33:07.020
<i>Could TV entertainment
address Black life in America,</i>

33:07.120 --> 33:10.890
<i>yet still sell success, the good life,</i>

33:10.990 --> 33:12.625
<i>the American dream?</i>

33:12.725 --> 33:14.961
<i>The look of success,
the feel of success,</i>

33:15.061 --> 33:16.896
<i>the power of success.</i>

33:16.996 --> 33:22.635
A luncheon I attended
in which Mr. Roy Wilkins spoke,

33:22.735 --> 33:27.573
and he spoke to a large group

33:27.674 --> 33:29.909
of Hollywood writers

33:30.009 --> 33:33.613
and producers and directors

33:34.113 --> 33:36.182
and made a pitch

33:36.282 --> 33:40.787
for gentler treatment
and more aware treatment

33:40.887 --> 33:42.689
of Blacks in all media.

33:42.789 --> 33:44.824
The end was always to be the inclusion
of the Negro American

33:44.924 --> 33:46.359
without racial discrimination...

33:46.459 --> 33:48.828
And he really
shook up that audience.

33:48.928 --> 33:51.264
...equal in all phases
of American citizenship.

33:51.364 --> 33:56.235
And I left there saying,
"There must be something I can do."

34:15.455 --> 34:21.594
I thought that I really owed
to my Black colleagues

34:21.694 --> 34:24.997
some sort of an apology
for a lot of the things

34:25.098 --> 34:27.667
that we had done on <i>Amos 'n Andy.</i>

34:27.767 --> 34:31.037
Too bad you didn't get back earlier.
You really missed it!

34:31.137 --> 34:33.406
- Missed what?
- Dr. Chegley has finally...

34:33.506 --> 34:38.044
Hal Kanter created
an environment that was new.

34:38.144 --> 34:40.780
So he created this young lady
who was a nurse,

34:40.880 --> 34:44.784
who had a family and an education...

34:45.618 --> 34:48.254
and she lived
in an integrated environment.

34:50.323 --> 34:52.458
- Well, how'd it go?
- It didn't.

34:52.558 --> 34:55.962
I tried, Marie. But with Brenda,
you have to turn her off first.

34:56.062 --> 34:58.698
However, if there's anything you'd like
to know about flamenco...

34:58.798 --> 35:00.700
...just ask.

35:00.800 --> 35:05.438
She didn't present a picture
of being either overly grateful

35:05.538 --> 35:08.574
or overly subservient.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.209
She felt she belonged there.

35:10.309 --> 35:12.945
We'll just have to figure out
some way for me to tell her.

35:13.045 --> 35:16.516
It felt like a step above

35:16.616 --> 35:20.920
the, uh, grinnin' domestic...

35:23.189 --> 35:27.426
who had to be very stout,

35:27.493 --> 35:29.495
very dark,

35:29.595 --> 35:32.431
preferably with large eyes

35:32.532 --> 35:34.734
and a wide grin.

35:38.171 --> 35:40.106
And I guess we were...

35:42.742 --> 35:47.013
tired of being so inundated
with that imagery

35:47.113 --> 35:50.917
that we accepted <i>Julia...</i>

35:51.918 --> 35:54.187
as a breath of fresh air.

35:55.254 --> 36:00.092
I think that we were
very one-dimensional in many areas.

36:00.193 --> 36:02.695
She was —
Listen, she was the perfect mother.

36:02.795 --> 36:04.964
- Did you brush your teeth?
- Yes, ma'am.

36:05.064 --> 36:08.935
Good. Brushing your teeth
wakes up your mouth.

36:09.035 --> 36:12.572
- And now you can eat breakfast.
- Mama, why are...

36:12.672 --> 36:16.409
What we had to do, I think, was to...

36:18.377 --> 36:23.783
find a kind of acceptable area

36:23.883 --> 36:25.551
that broke down some barriers

36:25.651 --> 36:28.120
and then we were able
to move on from there.

36:28.187 --> 36:29.722
- Hi!
- Hi.

36:49.175 --> 36:51.577
"Man who hath no music in himself..."

36:51.677 --> 36:55.481
"...is fit for treasons,
stratagems, and spoils."

36:57.850 --> 36:58.951
Greetings.

37:02.755 --> 37:04.457
That's your assignment.

37:05.358 --> 37:06.359
That man.

37:22.608 --> 37:25.778
We all watched <i>I Spy.</i>
I was 15 at the time.

37:25.878 --> 37:28.681
I couldn't wait to watch it.
He was my hero.

37:28.781 --> 37:33.185
He was a Rhodes scholar.
He was so articulate.

37:33.286 --> 37:34.954
I mean, so much more articulate

37:35.054 --> 37:38.357
than his sidekick, Robert Culp.

37:39.025 --> 37:41.027
Race was not a factor. These were two men.

37:41.127 --> 37:43.429
There was male bonding occurring there,

37:43.529 --> 37:46.399
loyalty, friendship, love between the two.

37:47.066 --> 37:50.469
And it had nothing to do with whether
one was Black or the other was white.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.438
Listen, we've been through a lot together.

37:52.538 --> 37:54.273
- Haven't we?
- I guess.

37:54.373 --> 37:57.343
I pulled you out of a lot
of close shaves, haven't I?

37:57.410 --> 37:58.811
Yeah.

37:58.911 --> 38:02.281
Well, I know you'd do the same thing
for me if I needed it, wouldn't ya?

38:02.381 --> 38:05.518
I would hold white hot steel
in my hand to save you.

38:05.618 --> 38:07.119
Are you kidding?

38:07.219 --> 38:10.523
Cosby's acceptance
was immediate and overwhelming,

38:11.290 --> 38:15.161
and this encouraged the medium,
the television medium, to say,

38:15.261 --> 38:17.229
"Hey, look what we discovered.

38:17.330 --> 38:21.434
Black people are not only acceptable,
but they're good box office.

38:21.534 --> 38:23.169
People like to watch 'em."

38:23.269 --> 38:26.906
Look, Kelly, you did what you could.

38:27.006 --> 38:29.608
- You phoned it into the police.
- Yeah.

38:29.709 --> 38:33.512
There's nothing else you could do.
Nothing.

38:34.380 --> 38:37.917
Alexander Scott, from <i>I Spy,</i>
and Julia were designed

38:38.017 --> 38:42.355
to overcome the received images
of Black people

38:42.455 --> 38:44.657
from all forms of media,

38:44.757 --> 38:46.759
whether it was minstrelsy and vaudeville,

38:46.859 --> 38:50.363
or whether it was television's
own early history itself.

38:54.767 --> 38:57.236
Hey! Whoo!

38:57.336 --> 38:58.604
Hey! Stop it!

39:03.209 --> 39:05.177
- Who's taking me today, you or Hannah?
- Me!

39:05.277 --> 39:08.381
These were fully assimilable
Black people.

39:08.481 --> 39:11.217
These were people who could
move into your neighborhood

39:11.317 --> 39:12.818
and not disturb you at all.

39:24.263 --> 39:26.665
- Thank you, Mrs. Waggedorn.
- Sure.

39:26.766 --> 39:28.667
I'll come back and get Corey...

39:28.768 --> 39:30.970
- That's your mother?
- Yeah.

39:31.070 --> 39:33.105
- You're what?
- Black.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.540
Your mother's colored.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.475
Of course. I'm colored too.

39:36.542 --> 39:37.643
You are?

39:37.743 --> 39:40.012
- Yeah!
- Oh, boy!

39:46.052 --> 39:48.487
The political climate of the 1960s

39:48.587 --> 39:52.191
sort of forbade liberal-thinking producers

39:52.291 --> 39:55.027
from putting any other kind of image
on television,

39:55.127 --> 39:58.864
and part of their mission,
if they perceived it as such,

39:58.964 --> 40:01.434
to amplify the civil rights movement

40:01.534 --> 40:04.437
rested in telling America

40:04.537 --> 40:07.940
that Black people were just like
white Americans,

40:08.040 --> 40:09.408
um, if not better.

40:09.508 --> 40:12.144
You should be proud to have
an Einstein in the family.

40:12.244 --> 40:17.016
I don't need a seven-year-old prodigy.
I want a normal child.

40:17.116 --> 40:18.717
But if I don't do something fast,

40:18.818 --> 40:21.921
Corey's going to wind up either
in the institute for advanced study

40:22.021 --> 40:23.355
or the funny kindergarten.

40:29.028 --> 40:31.230
You almost have
to over-endow the character

40:31.330 --> 40:35.334
with attributes that comfort
white, middle-class sensibilities

40:35.434 --> 40:37.903
and strip him or her of anything else,

40:38.003 --> 40:41.440
so that the sense of the white Negro

40:41.540 --> 40:44.110
becomes what it takes
to make them acceptable.

40:47.613 --> 40:50.716
In the Black community,
it caused a great deal of anger

40:50.816 --> 40:54.720
that said, "She's a sellout.
She's an Oreo cookie.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.790
Why doesn't this show represent the street

40:57.890 --> 41:01.393
where I spend my life, I spend my time?

41:01.494 --> 41:03.529
I don't wanna have to think about a woman

41:03.629 --> 41:05.998
that has pushed herself
into the middle class."

41:06.098 --> 41:07.766
We're all so proud of you!

41:07.867 --> 41:10.669
<i>The controversy around</i> Julia
<i>was typical of Black shows,</i>

41:10.769 --> 41:13.739
<i>not just in the '60s,
but before and since.</i>

41:13.839 --> 41:17.409
<i>Because prime-time images
of us were so rare,</i>

41:17.510 --> 41:20.479
<i>each image became precious,</i>

41:20.579 --> 41:24.683
<i>involuntarily bore the burden
of representing the race.</i>

41:26.285 --> 41:29.455
<i>But since such images
were typically one-dimensional,</i>

41:29.555 --> 41:31.090
<i>like most of television,</i>

41:31.190 --> 41:34.293
<i>they often came under attack,
despite high ratings,</i>

41:34.393 --> 41:37.029
<i>for what they failed to reflect.</i>

41:37.129 --> 41:38.797
Anybody who thinks they can intimidate...

41:38.898 --> 41:41.400
<i>And so where</i> Amos 'n Andy
<i>was faulted for featuring</i>

41:41.500 --> 41:44.003
<i>bumbling Black men in a segregated world...</i>

41:44.103 --> 41:46.438
Uh, don't get excited, Andy.

41:46.539 --> 41:48.874
This is Miss Yarby and Dr. Chegley.

41:48.974 --> 41:51.410
...Julia <i>was rebuked for much the opposite —</i>

41:51.510 --> 41:54.980
<i>an integrated world
with a successful Black family,</i>

41:55.080 --> 41:56.615
<i>minus Black men.</i>

41:56.715 --> 42:00.419
<i>The father had been conveniently killed
in military duty.</i>

42:00.519 --> 42:05.824
<i>A Black family severed from
African American culture and society.</i>

42:05.925 --> 42:09.461
Tonight, I think all of us
have everything we —

42:11.063 --> 42:13.232
<i>We interrupt this program.</i>

42:15.000 --> 42:16.902
<i>The worst race riot since Watts
erupted today.</i>

42:17.002 --> 42:18.837
<i>... more than two dozen fires...</i>

42:18.938 --> 42:21.874
<i>A massive show of force
by Miami police forces...</i>

42:21.974 --> 42:25.211
<i>In Mississippi, two more
Black students were shot and killed...</i>

42:25.311 --> 42:28.047
<i>- ... 200 arrested...
- ... shot and killed.</i>

42:28.147 --> 42:30.683
It's almost as if there
were two Black Americas.

42:30.783 --> 42:32.985
There was the Black America
that you saw on the news,

42:33.085 --> 42:37.256
which confronted racial issues head on.

42:37.356 --> 42:38.757
Can we get a doctor?

42:40.492 --> 42:42.795
And then there was
the Black America that you saw

42:42.895 --> 42:45.965
the rest of the evening
on prime-time television,

42:46.065 --> 42:49.935
where racial hostility
was virtually absent,

42:50.035 --> 42:53.405
where harmony dictated the neighborhood,

42:53.505 --> 42:55.741
where there were no signs

42:55.841 --> 42:58.310
of any kinds of struggles
with segregation.

42:58.410 --> 43:00.379
<i>Arrests continue...</i>

43:00.479 --> 43:04.316
So you get on screen
this idealized view

43:04.416 --> 43:06.819
of how Blacks and whites work together

43:06.919 --> 43:12.791
that most people knew
were inaccurately depicting the reality.

43:20.599 --> 43:23.002
What I said at the time

43:23.102 --> 43:25.671
was that the audience

43:25.771 --> 43:28.073
gets enough of the confrontation

43:28.173 --> 43:30.576
and the incendiary actions

43:30.676 --> 43:33.812
of people in the ghettos

43:33.912 --> 43:36.448
and people in Watts, for instance.

43:36.548 --> 43:39.918
Uh, they see enough of that on the news.

43:40.019 --> 43:42.221
They read enough of that in the newspaper.

43:42.321 --> 43:47.226
When they turn on television
to have a half an hour of pleasantry,

43:47.326 --> 43:48.894
let's ignore all of that.

43:55.467 --> 44:00.606
In those days, our mandate
was to amuse an audience,

44:00.706 --> 44:02.241
not to excite them,

44:02.341 --> 44:04.843
and I stuck to that mandate

44:04.943 --> 44:08.814
to try and amuse as many people
as I possibly could.

44:12.718 --> 44:16.221
The point is that there is
this universe of experience

44:16.322 --> 44:17.956
that is held up as the norm,

44:18.057 --> 44:20.759
and once people enter it,
including whites,

44:20.859 --> 44:25.130
then everybody has to sort of work hard
to participate in that universe.

44:25.230 --> 44:27.766
<i>America's favorite family, the Nelsons...</i>

44:27.866 --> 44:30.469
The entertainment function
of television is predicated

44:30.569 --> 44:33.105
on the assumption that this world

44:33.205 --> 44:36.275
is a comforting world
that we all aspire to —

44:36.375 --> 44:40.079
Black, white, Latino,
Chinese, Japanese, it doesn't matter.

44:43.248 --> 44:46.618
That's where I think
television's ideological function,

44:46.719 --> 44:48.454
to use that language,

44:48.554 --> 44:50.789
really starts to show up.

44:50.889 --> 44:54.927
But it's hidden behind this notion that
television is only there to entertain.

44:55.027 --> 44:57.396
Well, in its entertainment,
what it's doing

44:57.496 --> 45:01.100

45:09.775 --> 45:11.276

45:11.377 --> 45:14.213

Hi, Marie. Diapers again?

46:39.798 --> 46:41.633
I was in World War II, fella,

46:41.733 --> 46:43.836

- Because we demanded freedom!
- ...to the oceans white with foam!

<i>All in the Family</i>
absolutely blew the lid off

47:26.445 --> 47:29.414
of these conventions of families,

47:29.515 --> 47:31.917
like the ones you would see
on <i>The Donna Reed Show</i>

47:32.017 --> 47:35.888
or <i>The Brady Bunch</i> or <i>Father Knows Best.</i>

47:35.988 --> 47:38.490
You'd never hear
those white male head of households

47:38.590 --> 47:40.926
say anything disparaging
about Black people,

47:41.026 --> 47:42.794
but you certainly heard it
from Archie Bunker.

47:42.895 --> 47:44.563
Now, listen, little girl.

47:44.663 --> 47:46.598
I've been around a lot of places.
I've done a lot of things.

47:46.698 --> 47:48.600
But there's one thing Archie Bunker
ain't never gonna do

47:48.700 --> 47:50.869
and that's break bread
with no jungle bunnies.

47:52.905 --> 47:57.809
When I started <i>All in the Family,</i>
one of the early accusations was,

47:57.910 --> 48:00.279
"What is this guy doing sending messages?"

48:00.379 --> 48:04.483
Or, "How dare he talk about these subjects

48:04.583 --> 48:08.086
or address these subjects?"

48:08.186 --> 48:12.824
Uh, and I remember very early thinking,

48:12.925 --> 48:15.460
"My God, they're talking
about sending messages."

48:15.561 --> 48:19.965
What was the message
in all of the television shows,

48:20.065 --> 48:23.502
especially the situation comedies
of the '60s?

48:23.602 --> 48:26.605
The message was louder and clearer
than anything I could do.

48:26.705 --> 48:30.943
It was, there were no race problems
in America.

48:31.043 --> 48:32.644
There was no Vietnam.

48:32.744 --> 48:35.881
So I thought,
"Well, we're not saying that much at all."

48:35.981 --> 48:38.317
You're the one that needs
an American history lesson.

48:38.417 --> 48:40.352
You don't know nothing about Lady Liberty,

48:40.452 --> 48:43.155
standing there in the harbor
with her torch held high,

48:43.255 --> 48:45.290
screaming out
to all the nations in the world,

48:45.390 --> 48:47.993
"Send me your poor,
your deadbeats, your filthy."

48:50.028 --> 48:51.830
And all the nations sent them in here.

48:51.930 --> 48:53.966
They'd come swarming in like ants —

48:54.066 --> 48:58.070
your Spanish PRs
from the Cariboo in there,

48:58.170 --> 49:01.306
your Japs, your Chinamen,
your Krauts and your Hebes

49:01.406 --> 49:03.208
and your English fags!

49:04.443 --> 49:07.646
All of 'em come in here
and they're all free to live

49:07.746 --> 49:09.648
in their own separate sections...

49:11.583 --> 49:13.085
...where they feel safe.

49:13.185 --> 49:15.854
And they'll bust your head
if you go in there.

49:15.954 --> 49:18.790
That's what makes America great, buddy!

49:18.890 --> 49:21.460
I think that Norman Lear's programming

49:21.560 --> 49:26.031
represented the first steps
towards reality

49:26.131 --> 49:28.934
in depicting American households,

49:29.034 --> 49:31.269
and I think it's because the public

49:31.370 --> 49:34.106
was growing intolerant across the board

49:34.206 --> 49:37.142
of these perfect families they were seeing
on prime-time television.

49:41.780 --> 49:43.682
<i>Throughout television's history,</i>

49:43.782 --> 49:48.720
<i>the prime-time family had been
a sanctuary against social crisis.</i>

49:48.820 --> 49:51.289
<i>Lear readjusted this picture.</i>

49:51.390 --> 49:56.695
<i>The TV family, as in real life,

<i>... 400 extra policemen tomorrow...</i>

50:06.838 --> 50:09.174

50:30.762 --> 50:32.464
Well, let's see how wonderful it is

50:32.564 --> 50:35.267
when the watermelon rinds
come flying out the window!

50:37.636 --> 50:41.673
My father was as racist
as Archie Bunker, in his own way,

50:41.773 --> 50:45.077
and I used to fight with him all the time,

50:45.177 --> 50:48.180
and I never thought anybody in America
would have a problem

50:48.280 --> 50:50.315
with the kind of thing
they lived with all the time.

50:50.415 --> 50:54.352
I think that if God had meant us to be
together, he'd have put us together.

50:54.453 --> 50:56.955
But look what he done.
He put you over in Africa.

50:57.055 --> 50:59.291
He put the rest of us
in all the white countries.

51:05.864 --> 51:07.866
Well, you must have told him
where we were,

51:07.966 --> 51:09.868

52:36.955 --> 52:42.727

52:43.261 --> 52:47.032
James, how long we been married?

52:47.132 --> 52:50.135
- Getting on towards 21 years now.
- That's right.

52:50.235 --> 52:53.805
And we had a lot of arguments
in them 21 years, right?

52:53.905 --> 52:55.774
Yeah, we're having
a pretty good one right now.

52:55.874 --> 52:57.609
Yeah.

52:57.709 --> 53:00.011
Good Times
<i>was the first prime-time series</i>

53:00.111 --> 53:03.882
<i>to feature a Black family
with both mother and father.</i>

53:03.982 --> 53:07.552
<i>In contrast to
the integrationist shows of the '60s,</i>

53:07.652 --> 53:11.489
Good Times <i>was set in the heart
of Chicago's Black South Side community.</i>

53:11.590 --> 53:13.258
I mean, we are poor.

53:13.358 --> 53:16.294
If you was to make a list of
all the things that people want to be,

53:16.394 --> 53:18.563
"poor" would be right down
at the bottom of the list,

53:18.663 --> 53:20.365
just above sick and dead!

53:24.870 --> 53:27.606
I think with <i>Good Times,</i>
you get the attempt

53:27.706 --> 53:30.075
to basically replicate
what you have in <i>All in the Family,</i>

53:30.175 --> 53:33.912
but make it more relevant

54:35.307 --> 54:37.776
<i>Good Times</i> represented
the greatest potential

54:37.876 --> 54:40.045
and also, in my opinion,
the greatest failure.

54:40.145 --> 54:43.415
It had the greatest potential
because it was an inner-city family

54:43.515 --> 54:45.717
that was nuclear, that was solid.

54:45.817 --> 54:47.519
What is it, another eviction notice?

who works down at the projects,

54:55.627 --> 54:56.995
he said, "Don't worry about it."

54:57.095 --> 54:58.730
That's the same Monte that said,

54:58.830 --> 55:01.199
"Nixon was gonna be
poor folks' best friend."

55:02.400 --> 55:03.835
Oh, James, I'm so sorry.

55:03.935 --> 55:06.404
They would talk about real-world issues

55:06.504 --> 55:10.742
and how an actual Black family
deals with those real-world issues

55:10.842 --> 55:13.678
of racism and economic discrimination.

55:13.778 --> 55:14.779
But what happened?

55:14.846 --> 55:16.348
Dynamite!

55:19.517 --> 55:21.619
They elevated J.J.'s role,

55:21.720 --> 55:25.357
which had been one of amusing
and sometimes sophisticated comedy,

55:25.457 --> 55:27.459
to that of a buffoon.

55:32.797 --> 55:35.000
His humor was tied

55:35.100 --> 55:39.971
to a long tradition
of the kind of minstrel character.

55:52.283 --> 55:55.153
J.J.'s function in it
was essentially to deflate,

55:55.253 --> 55:58.823
to let off a lot of the buildup

55:58.923 --> 56:03.595
in the particular issues
that the show tried to address.

56:03.695 --> 56:05.363
I mean, I thought it was a very—

56:05.463 --> 56:09.667
in retrospect, particularly,
a very clever use of a character

56:09.768 --> 56:14.706
to rob the show of the kind
of political bite that it might have.

56:14.806 --> 56:17.742
No! Oh-oh-oh!

56:41.266 --> 56:45.336
On the one hand,
many of us applauded these TV programs

56:45.437 --> 56:48.807
because at last,
the "reality" of the Black experience —

56:48.907 --> 56:51.609
that is, inner-city life —
was being represented.

56:51.709 --> 56:54.646
On the other hand,
these programs were problematic

56:54.746 --> 56:58.450
because they represented
the hellholes of the ghetto

56:58.550 --> 57:01.486
as places where human beings
could survive.

57:01.586 --> 57:03.721

57:09.160 --> 57:13.565

these real-world situations

57:13.665 --> 57:17.969

and intolerable

57:18.069 --> 57:19.237

57:31.483 --> 57:35.753

is uncomfortable with victimization

57:35.854 --> 57:38.423
or however you wanna term
the Black experience.

57:48.533 --> 57:50.969
<i>By what formula, what alchemy,</i>

57:51.069 --> 57:55.874
<i>could television transform
racial oppression and racial guilt</i>

57:55.974 --> 57:59.077
<i>into a drama of the American dream?</i>

58:13.691 --> 58:17.428
I felt that <i>Roots</i>
didn't sound like a good idea

58:17.529 --> 58:20.865
with 90% of the country white,
10% of the country Black.

58:20.965 --> 58:23.668
I'm gonna do a 12-hour show
where the whites are the villains

58:23.768 --> 58:25.136
and the Blacks are the heroes.

58:25.236 --> 58:28.039
Does not sound like a very good idea
when you first say it.

58:28.907 --> 58:30.842
But the thing that attracted me

58:30.942 --> 58:34.579
was it showed two things.

58:34.679 --> 58:37.682
Number one,
it showed the power of an underdog

58:37.782 --> 58:40.652
overcoming enormous odds to succeed.

58:40.752 --> 58:43.121
Number two, it showed the power of family.

58:44.923 --> 58:48.793
I know that whites are going to be
very uncomfortable seeing this program.

58:48.893 --> 58:50.995
Look at this baby.

58:51.095 --> 58:54.899
I said I'm gonna have to cast
my Blacks... actors

58:54.999 --> 58:59.204
as comfortable as I can
for the audience watching.

58:59.304 --> 59:02.373
I did not want to scare away
my white audience

59:02.473 --> 59:04.542
before they got to see the program.

59:04.642 --> 59:07.145
I wanted to get them in to see the show.

59:07.245 --> 59:09.414
And if they thought
they were gonna see a show

59:09.514 --> 59:12.083
where they were going to be, um,

59:12.183 --> 59:14.152
overpowered by the actor —

59:14.252 --> 59:18.389
you know, overpowering them
in some social message —

59:18.489 --> 59:20.325
they may not watch the show.

59:20.425 --> 59:22.894
Never had so many white viewers

59:22.994 --> 59:25.997
watched anything Black
in the history of television.

59:26.097 --> 59:27.599
That was amazing.

59:28.266 --> 59:32.503
Oh, God, no. No, massa.
You can't sell Kizzy too!

59:32.604 --> 59:35.540
No, massa, not my baby. Not my child!

59:35.640 --> 59:39.244
Oh, massa, no! Not my child, not my baby!

59:40.211 --> 59:42.146
- Massa. Massa.
- Bell.

59:42.247 --> 59:44.749
Massa, beat her.
Do anything you want to her!

59:44.849 --> 59:48.987
Anything, massa.
Tear the skin off her worthless hide!

59:49.087 --> 59:51.189
She a awful nigger
to do such a thing, massa!

59:51.289 --> 59:56.194
Please, massa,
in the name of Jesus, have mercy!

59:56.294 --> 59:59.497
Me and Toby, we give you our lives, massa.

59:59.564 --> 1:00:00.798
Massa —

1:00:02.867 --> 1:00:04.435
Forty years, massa!

1:00:04.535 --> 1:00:06.204
Forty years I served you.

1:00:06.304 --> 1:00:08.973
- Don't that count for something?
- Well, you're doing your job.

1:00:09.073 --> 1:00:11.743
She disobeyed the rules.
She has to suffer the consequences.

1:00:11.843 --> 1:00:12.977
That's all there is to it.

1:00:13.077 --> 1:00:16.047
Massa, please, please, massa, I beg you!

1:00:16.147 --> 1:00:19.684
Please don't sell her! Please, massa!

1:00:20.285 --> 1:00:21.853
She's already been sold.

1:00:24.422 --> 1:00:27.091
Oh, then, massa,
please sell me and Bell with her.

1:00:27.825 --> 1:00:29.727
But don't split up the family, massa.

1:00:29.827 --> 1:00:31.996
You ain't never been that kind of man.
Please, massa!

1:00:32.096 --> 1:00:34.565
Mr. Tom Moore owns Kizzy now.

1:00:35.566 --> 1:00:37.368
Mr. Odell will take her away then.

1:00:37.468 --> 1:00:39.971
- Massa.
- No, no, I don't wanna go!

1:00:40.071 --> 1:00:41.306
Oh, God, my baby!

1:00:41.406 --> 1:00:44.909
<i>No, no! Mama!</i>

1:00:45.009 --> 1:00:46.744
<i>Kizzy! Kizzy!</i>

1:00:50.081 --> 1:00:52.383
<i>Missy Anne, please, please!</i>

1:00:52.483 --> 1:00:55.186
<i>- Missy Anne, please!
- My baby!</i>

1:00:55.286 --> 1:00:57.055
- My baby!
- Missy Anne, please!

1:00:57.155 --> 1:00:58.690
Help me! Help me!

1:00:58.790 --> 1:01:01.159
Mama! Mama!

1:01:01.225 --> 1:01:03.194
Mama, no!

1:01:03.294 --> 1:01:04.862
Mama, help me!

1:01:04.962 --> 1:01:08.933
<i>Missy Anne, please don't! No, no, no...</i>

1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:10.535
<i>Mama!</i>

1:01:10.635 --> 1:01:13.404
<i>Oh, Lord, holy — Oh!</i>

1:01:13.504 --> 1:01:18.576
Lots of people, I think,
can tell you about the aftermath of <i>Roots</i>

1:01:18.676 --> 1:01:20.545
in the workplace or in the school,

1:01:20.645 --> 1:01:24.682
about going to work or going to school
after each night and the episodes,

1:01:24.782 --> 1:01:28.119
and the kinds of conversations
and dialogues that were opening up

1:01:28.219 --> 1:01:30.755
between Black and white Americans
for the first time,

1:01:30.855 --> 1:01:33.991
in the aftermath
of those episodes of the program.

1:01:34.092 --> 1:01:35.660
It's a very profound experience.

1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:40.431
There was something that gripped America
about this story that Alex Haley wrote

1:01:40.531 --> 1:01:43.301
about a current Black person

1:01:43.401 --> 1:01:46.170
tracing his history

1:01:46.270 --> 1:01:49.741
all the way over into Africa
and going there and finding relatives.

1:01:49.841 --> 1:01:51.943
I think that part of
the popularity of <i>Roots</i>

1:01:52.043 --> 1:01:54.445
was for just that reason —

1:01:54.545 --> 1:01:56.180
it showed Black people

1:01:56.280 --> 1:01:59.917
being just like every other
American immigrant group

1:02:00.017 --> 1:02:03.121
for the first time
to such a large audience.

1:02:03.221 --> 1:02:05.690
<i>Roots</i> was a Horatio Alger story,
that's correct,

1:02:05.790 --> 1:02:08.493
about starting up a family here
and ending up here.

1:02:08.593 --> 1:02:10.628
And that's a good story.

1:02:11.462 --> 1:02:16.300
Positive stories are much more
acceptable to audiences

1:02:16.401 --> 1:02:17.869
than negative stories are.

1:02:17.969 --> 1:02:21.506
There ain't nothing hard
about being happy.

1:02:21.606 --> 1:02:22.907
Go on then, mule!

1:02:25.009 --> 1:02:27.412
- Ain't nothing gonna stop us now!
- Let's move on!

1:02:27.512 --> 1:02:29.380
<i>Roots</i> was still an assimilation story.

1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:32.150
The way in which it was made palatable

1:02:32.250 --> 1:02:34.352
and the way in which it was made
a powerful story

1:02:34.452 --> 1:02:40.391
was to make it a family saga
about movement into America.

1:02:44.562 --> 1:02:49.600
It didn't indict the American society.

1:02:50.535 --> 1:02:53.070
It was an indictment of bad people.

1:02:53.171 --> 1:02:57.975
It was an indictment
of certain forms of brutality,

1:02:58.075 --> 1:03:00.711
but in terms of the whole edifice

1:03:00.812 --> 1:03:06.083
of American political,
social, cultural structure,

1:03:06.184 --> 1:03:09.086
it came away pretty unscathed.

1:03:09.187 --> 1:03:13.591
We's here! This here our land!

1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:20.231
<i>We had finally found a place
in mainstream America,</i>

1:03:20.331 --> 1:03:22.533
<i>less by changing society</i>

1:03:22.633 --> 1:03:25.036
<i>as by patiently adapting to it.</i>

1:03:27.071 --> 1:03:31.476
<i>Television's profoundly conservative bias
was again underscored.</i>

1:03:31.576 --> 1:03:35.646
<i>Prime time has selectively
reframed American history,</i>

1:03:35.746 --> 1:03:38.349
<i>transforming a national disgrace</i>

1:03:38.449 --> 1:03:43.454
<i>into an epic triumph
of the family and the American dream.</i>

1:03:45.389 --> 1:03:48.759
<i>Still, it seemed for many of us that</i> Roots

1:03:48.860 --> 1:03:54.765
<i>had at last delivered the positive image
of Black success we'd long dreamed of.</i>

1:03:56.367 --> 1:03:59.270
<i>But had we reached the promised land?</i>

1:04:15.553 --> 1:04:18.956
If you took the argument implicit
in Black history about our images

1:04:19.056 --> 1:04:21.158
to its logical conclusion,

1:04:22.093 --> 1:04:26.063
the millennium would come
when a refined Afro-American doctor...

1:04:27.064 --> 1:04:29.000
and his wife,

1:04:29.100 --> 1:04:33.437
who, let's say, hypothetically
was a partner in a Wall Street law firm,

1:04:34.238 --> 1:04:40.278
and who would be obviously
comfortable, very elegant, well educated,

1:04:40.378 --> 1:04:44.549
who would have lovely, perfect children
who would, of course, go off to college.

1:04:44.649 --> 1:04:47.218
If an image such as that
could be projected,

1:04:47.318 --> 1:04:50.388
let's say, into virtually
every American home,

1:04:50.488 --> 1:04:52.323
the argument went, historically,

1:04:52.423 --> 1:04:53.958
we as a people would be free.

1:04:59.297 --> 1:05:01.666
Hey, back from shopping. How was it?

1:05:01.766 --> 1:05:03.234
Great. We only had one fight.

1:05:03.334 --> 1:05:05.770
It started the moment we left
and it hasn't finished yet.

1:05:05.870 --> 1:05:07.572
- Now, what happened?
- I took him to Bookmans.

1:05:07.672 --> 1:05:09.073
He told me I couldn't go in.

1:05:09.173 --> 1:05:12.109
Dad, Bookmans is a menswear store.

1:05:12.209 --> 1:05:16.480
Menswear store.
No mothers allowed.

1:05:16.581 --> 1:05:19.850
Before <i>The Cosby Show</i> came on,

1:05:19.951 --> 1:05:24.722
the American public had been bombarded
with negative images of the Black family.

1:05:24.822 --> 1:05:29.193
When <i>The Cosby Show</i> came on,
and I know even in Cosby's thinking,

1:05:29.293 --> 1:05:34.365
that it was seen that
the Huxtables, the family,

1:05:34.465 --> 1:05:39.103
would be a good opportunity to project
new images of Black people in America

1:05:39.203 --> 1:05:42.740
that ultimately might diminish...

1:05:43.507 --> 1:05:46.477
um, uh, attitudes of racism

1:05:46.577 --> 1:05:48.012
rather than to support them.

1:05:48.112 --> 1:05:50.581
<i>From its premiere,</i>
The Cosby Show

1:05:50.681 --> 1:05:53.851
<i>catapulted into America's top ten shows.</i>

1:05:53.951 --> 1:05:58.255
<i>The triumphant saga of</i> Roots
<i>continued in the Huxtables.</i>

1:05:58.356 --> 1:06:00.257
Dad!

1:06:00.358 --> 1:06:03.361
No 14-year-old boy

1:06:03.461 --> 1:06:06.097
should have a $95 shirt

1:06:06.197 --> 1:06:09.333
unless he is onstage
with his four brothers.

1:06:12.136 --> 1:06:15.539
<i>In part, the show's success
was its image of success,</i>

1:06:15.640 --> 1:06:21.045
<i>an image perfectly attuned to the politics
of post-civil rights America.</i>

1:06:23.748 --> 1:06:26.717
Economic recovery,
rededication to values,

1:06:26.817 --> 1:06:30.121
all show the spirit of renewal
gaining the upper hand,

1:06:30.221 --> 1:06:33.257
and all will improve
family life in the '80s.

1:06:36.827 --> 1:06:39.830
We need to replace a welfare system

1:06:39.930 --> 1:06:43.734
that destroys economic independence
in the family

1:06:43.834 --> 1:06:46.470
with one that creates
incentives for recipients

1:06:46.570 --> 1:06:49.440
to move up and out of dependency.

1:06:51.008 --> 1:06:53.044
The Reagan ideology was predominantly

1:06:53.144 --> 1:06:56.881
that if you open up access
to corporations to make money,

1:06:56.981 --> 1:06:58.849
then the opportunity structure opens up.

1:06:58.949 --> 1:07:00.284
Well, we see that didn't happen.

1:07:00.384 --> 1:07:03.521
<i>There will be record
numbers of the homeless this winter...</i>

1:07:03.621 --> 1:07:06.090
<i>Business failures
recently hit a 40-year high.</i>

1:07:06.190 --> 1:07:08.893
<i>Among Blacks,
the unemployment rate was almost double...</i>

1:07:08.993 --> 1:07:12.663
We've got this incredible
polarization of rich and poor,

1:07:12.763 --> 1:07:19.070
and Black people converged
around the poverty end of that.

1:07:19.170 --> 1:07:21.739
And I think that to have, then,

1:07:21.839 --> 1:07:27.311
a show that mediates
between that polarization,

1:07:27.411 --> 1:07:30.081
we come away with a sense in which,
well, the society's fine.

1:07:30.181 --> 1:07:31.348
I mean, there's no problem.

1:07:31.449 --> 1:07:35.720
You just have to work hard,
you just have to have the right values,

1:07:35.820 --> 1:07:39.190
have the right kinds
of desires and aspirations,

1:07:39.290 --> 1:07:41.092
and it'll be all right.

1:07:41.192 --> 1:07:43.694
None of this would have happened
if we weren't so rich.

1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:52.303
Let me get something straight. Okay?

1:07:52.870 --> 1:07:55.573
Your mother and I are rich.

1:07:56.207 --> 1:07:58.209
You have nothing.

1:08:01.145 --> 1:08:03.414
Your father and I are not rich.

1:08:03.514 --> 1:08:06.150
- We're not?
- No, honey, we're not rich.

1:08:06.250 --> 1:08:08.052
Rich is when your money works for you,

1:08:08.152 --> 1:08:10.721
not when you work for the money,
and we work hard for the money.

1:08:10.788 --> 1:08:11.822
Ah, yes.

1:08:11.922 --> 1:08:14.458
<i>In many ways,
the Huxtable household</i>

1:08:14.558 --> 1:08:17.161
<i>favored prime-time families of old.</i>

1:08:17.261 --> 1:08:20.564
<i>The TV family was, again,
a mythic sanctuary,</i>

1:08:20.664 --> 1:08:23.334
<i>a shield against social crisis.</i>

1:08:25.636 --> 1:08:29.807
<i>Within the worsening polarization
of 1980s America,</i>

1:08:29.907 --> 1:08:34.845
<i>this dream of the happy, harmonious,
successful Black family</i>

1:08:34.945 --> 1:08:37.114
<i>held a powerful seduction.</i>

1:08:37.214 --> 1:08:39.683
<i>Dad, I have to go to school
with these girls.</i>

1:08:39.784 --> 1:08:43.287
<i>Cosby</i> represents everyone's fantasy.

1:08:43.387 --> 1:08:44.855
Everyone wants to live that way.

1:08:44.955 --> 1:08:47.291
Uh, did you lose the case, dear?

1:08:47.391 --> 1:08:51.428
Oh, I wish I had lost it.
At least the thing would be over with.

1:08:51.529 --> 1:08:54.999
The most successful shows

1:08:55.099 --> 1:08:59.436
depicting the African American experience
in America

1:08:59.537 --> 1:09:01.238
are shows like <i>Cosby</i>

1:09:01.338 --> 1:09:06.177
that reaffirmed the American dream
and hard-core middle class values,

1:09:06.277 --> 1:09:09.046
where you work hard,

1:09:09.146 --> 1:09:12.149
you are rewarded
with good-looking children,

1:09:12.249 --> 1:09:15.686
good-looking wives,
nice cars, nice households.

1:09:15.786 --> 1:09:18.756
And that image is the one
that's perpetuated.

1:09:19.623 --> 1:09:25.496
Anything that —
that digresses from that norm

1:09:25.563 --> 1:09:27.231
is suspect

1:09:27.331 --> 1:09:32.903
and will probably not be granted tenure
on prime-time television...

1:09:33.003 --> 1:09:35.005
<i>- ♪ Do you know what it means ♪</i>
- ...as is evidenced

1:09:35.105 --> 1:09:36.607
by a program like <i>Frank's Place.</i>

1:09:36.707 --> 1:09:38.375
<i>♪ To miss New Orleans ♪</i>

1:09:38.475 --> 1:09:42.713
<i>♪ Where mockingbirds used to sing ♪</i>

1:09:43.781 --> 1:09:46.517
For many people, <i>Frank's Place</i>

1:09:46.617 --> 1:09:49.787
was the best television program
involving Black people

1:09:49.887 --> 1:09:51.322
that there's ever been.

1:09:52.556 --> 1:09:55.659
<i>Frank's Place</i> showed
a broader range of types

1:09:55.759 --> 1:09:59.496
than any other Black television program
that I can remember,

1:09:59.597 --> 1:10:01.866
but it was killed by the ratings.

1:10:02.933 --> 1:10:07.137
<i>♪ I dream of oleanders in June ♪</i>

1:10:07.238 --> 1:10:08.973
They didn't know how to handle it

1:10:09.073 --> 1:10:12.343
and they supposedly couldn't
schedule it with anything.

1:10:12.443 --> 1:10:15.112
Whatever they scheduled it with,
there was a problem.

1:10:15.212 --> 1:10:17.748
It didn't relate to anything else
they had on the schedule,

1:10:17.848 --> 1:10:19.683
so they moved it six times.

1:10:19.783 --> 1:10:21.418
The audience couldn't find the show.

1:10:21.518 --> 1:10:23.554
My mother couldn't find the show
half the time.

1:10:23.654 --> 1:10:25.789
<i>♪ And there's something more ♪</i>

1:10:25.890 --> 1:10:28.259
<i>♪ I miss the one I care for ♪</i>

1:10:28.359 --> 1:10:33.097
<i>♪ More than I miss New Orleans ♪</i>

1:10:33.197 --> 1:10:36.300
We looked for the unusual
whenever we did the show,

1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:38.068
but we caught constant flak.

1:10:38.168 --> 1:10:39.703
They didn't want us to do it.

1:10:39.803 --> 1:10:41.672
They kept wanting us to be funny.

1:10:41.772 --> 1:10:45.576
Now if we had been funnier,
we'd probably still be on the air.

1:10:45.676 --> 1:10:48.145
They really want you to be colorless.

1:10:48.245 --> 1:10:52.182
They want you not to bring
your race with you.

1:10:52.283 --> 1:10:54.718
He shouldn't be off gallivanting
with a bunch of snobs

1:10:54.818 --> 1:10:57.288
who are laughing at him behind his back
'cause he's colored.

1:10:58.689 --> 1:11:01.425
He oughta be just here letting us —

1:11:01.492 --> 1:11:02.993
I'm colored?

1:11:03.794 --> 1:11:06.463
What do you mean, I'm colored?
I haven't heard that word in 20 years.

1:11:07.798 --> 1:11:09.600
- It's nothing, Frank.
- No, I wanna know.

1:11:17.975 --> 1:11:20.344
- See this bag?
- Yeah.

1:11:20.444 --> 1:11:22.713
Which is darker, me or the bag?

1:11:22.780 --> 1:11:23.847
You.

1:11:25.950 --> 1:11:29.386
- Which is darker, you or the bag?
- What are you talking about?

1:11:29.486 --> 1:11:31.422
The capital "C" club?

1:11:31.522 --> 1:11:34.458
In the old days, Frank,
if you were a light-skinned Black,

1:11:34.558 --> 1:11:38.595
you were a Creole,
and they spell Creole with a capital "C."

1:11:39.630 --> 1:11:43.434
If you were dark-skinned,
it was creole with a little "C,"

1:11:43.534 --> 1:11:46.770
and there was a big difference
between the two.

1:11:49.340 --> 1:11:52.543
Skin color used to be the big separator
in New Orleans, Frank.

1:11:52.609 --> 1:11:54.445
Still is.

1:11:54.545 --> 1:11:58.315
They just ain't
as out in the open about it.

1:11:58.415 --> 1:12:00.718
Why would Ozell Dryer have me there?

1:12:05.789 --> 1:12:09.493
So, what was I going to be,
the first darkie in the capital "C" club?

1:12:11.228 --> 1:12:13.630
Oh, man, look, I am sorry.

1:12:13.731 --> 1:12:16.033
I should have been
more up-front with you about this.

1:12:16.133 --> 1:12:19.303
But there's a group of us in the club
that are trying to change things.

1:12:19.403 --> 1:12:21.271
- And I'm the guinea pig?
- Well, sort of.

1:12:22.272 --> 1:12:26.910
See, you've got all the credentials
to put an end to this whole color thing.

1:12:27.011 --> 1:12:29.213
Ozell, let me cut to the chase here, okay?

1:12:30.347 --> 1:12:33.183
All my life, I've been "the only Black."

1:12:33.283 --> 1:12:34.885
I was the only Black in this class.

1:12:34.985 --> 1:12:36.587
I was the only Black in that organization.

1:12:36.687 --> 1:12:38.856
I was the only Black on this team.

1:12:38.956 --> 1:12:42.092
Look, man, I'm not about to become
the only Black in a Black club.

1:12:42.192 --> 1:12:44.228
I think that's going a little too far.
Don't you think?

1:12:44.328 --> 1:12:46.764
<i>Frank's Place</i> was too real for Americans.

1:12:46.864 --> 1:12:49.800
I mean, it was the closest thing
to the reality

1:12:49.900 --> 1:12:53.404
that I experienced growing up
and that I experience now

1:12:53.504 --> 1:12:55.672
as a person of color in American society

1:12:55.773 --> 1:12:57.574
that I have encountered on television.

1:12:57.674 --> 1:13:01.512
And I don't think that, um,
the average white American

1:13:01.612 --> 1:13:05.215
is prepared to encounter
the full complexity of that reality.

1:13:05.315 --> 1:13:09.119
They want to encounter
fictions of that reality

1:13:09.219 --> 1:13:11.789
which are palatable to them.

1:13:13.490 --> 1:13:16.060
They are comfortable with that,
with that kind of fantasy.

1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:19.063
They are very uncomfortable
with <i>Frank's Place.</i>

1:13:21.832 --> 1:13:22.966
And I understand that.

1:13:23.067 --> 1:13:26.403
And I'm not saying that that's
the worst thing in the world.

1:13:26.503 --> 1:13:29.640
It's just that I'm comfortable
with my people.

1:13:29.740 --> 1:13:31.308
I'm comfortable with my background.

1:13:31.408 --> 1:13:33.644
I wanna see my story told.

1:13:36.046 --> 1:13:38.415
<i>By the end of the 1980s,</i>

1:13:38.515 --> 1:13:42.953
<i>television had been in American homes
just over 40 years.</i>

1:13:43.053 --> 1:13:47.925
<i>The status of Black Americans
had remarkably improved.</i>

1:13:48.025 --> 1:13:50.928
You never told us how you feel
about Black people.

1:13:52.329 --> 1:13:55.265
Well, you sure gotta hand it to 'em.

1:13:55.365 --> 1:14:00.771
I mean, two years ago, they was nothing
but servants and janitors.

1:14:00.871 --> 1:14:05.242
Now they're teachers
and doctors and lawyers.

1:14:05.342 --> 1:14:07.711
They've come a long way on TV.

1:14:11.748 --> 1:14:16.753
<i>African Americans
continued to succeed, in prime time.</i>

1:14:16.854 --> 1:14:21.291
<i>But what of the historic dream
that new positive images</i>

1:14:21.391 --> 1:14:24.962
<i>would help improve
America's race relations?</i>

1:14:25.062 --> 1:14:31.301
I don't think that you can change
300 years of history,

1:14:31.401 --> 1:14:36.773
300 years of the exploitation of
Black people by white people in the West,

1:14:36.874 --> 1:14:39.109
that you can change hundreds of years

1:14:39.209 --> 1:14:42.279
of the representation of Black people
in stereotypical roles

1:14:42.379 --> 1:14:47.584
just by having a prominent Black man
in a situation comedy.

1:14:47.684 --> 1:14:49.653
It's not gonna work that way.

1:14:49.753 --> 1:14:52.556
Images are one part

1:14:52.656 --> 1:14:56.393
of a larger formula of social behavior,

1:14:56.493 --> 1:15:00.697
and you can't give to them
all of this importance,

1:15:00.797 --> 1:15:04.334
that they will free us
if only we can control them.

1:15:04.434 --> 1:15:08.105
They do not have
enough autonomy to liberate us.

1:15:09.706 --> 1:15:13.310
<i>Still, if TV alone
cannot liberate us,</i>

1:15:13.410 --> 1:15:17.281
<i>it continues to mold
how we are seen and defined.</i>

1:15:17.381 --> 1:15:21.051
One while, they said
we could only sing and dance.

1:15:22.753 --> 1:15:26.156
Then when we left singing and dancing,
we could only be comics.

1:15:28.392 --> 1:15:30.260
But there is room for the comic.

1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:33.497
There's room for the dancer.
There's room for the singer.

1:15:33.597 --> 1:15:38.035
There's room
for the serious dramatic actor.

1:15:39.703 --> 1:15:40.671
There is room —

1:15:40.771 --> 1:15:44.675
What makes you think a whole people...

1:15:46.543 --> 1:15:48.545
have to be alike?

1:15:50.214 --> 1:15:53.717
And how dull and uninteresting
we would be.

1:15:53.817 --> 1:15:58.255
What we get is the continuing press
towards an imaginary middle.

1:15:58.355 --> 1:16:02.125
And part of my critique is
of that imaginary middle,

1:16:02.226 --> 1:16:05.896
uh, whether it's a class middle,
whether it's a racial norm,

1:16:05.996 --> 1:16:10.801
um, whether it's some idealized aspiration
about what a good life is.

1:16:10.901 --> 1:16:15.138
I think that what we need
are more complicated ways

1:16:15.239 --> 1:16:19.109
of imagining ourselves in the world

1:16:19.209 --> 1:16:24.348
that are truer to what people know
and what people's imaginations are about,

1:16:24.448 --> 1:16:28.485
and that those things
are inflected by difference,

1:16:28.585 --> 1:16:32.789
and that what we need to do
is begin to illuminate that difference,

1:16:32.889 --> 1:16:37.294
not so that people are divided
and can't have access to each other,

1:16:37.394 --> 1:16:40.631
but so that we understand
the ways in which inequality

1:16:40.731 --> 1:16:42.532
gets perpetuated and operates.

1:16:42.633 --> 1:16:47.104
But also so that we learn more about
each other and more about ourselves.

1:16:47.204 --> 1:16:49.806
And I think that television
simply hasn't done that.
