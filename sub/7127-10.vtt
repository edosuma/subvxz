00:01.000 --> 00:02.525
Previously on Eli Stone:

00:02.602 --> 00:06.561
Look, Eli, sometimes I can see things
that haven't happened yet.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.233
Didn't know what he meant,
how I could help you...

00:09.342 --> 00:11.401
He saw the future.
Like he said he could.

00:11.478 --> 00:13.810
You've been acting
strange ever since the kiss.

00:13.880 --> 00:17.509
- Shh! I have a boyfriend!
- I'd never believe Stone let you go.

00:17.584 --> 00:20.348
Last night was a
drunken, stupid mistake.

00:20.453 --> 00:23.081
Our neurology chief,
he found a brain aneurysm.

00:23.156 --> 00:25.818
- I know how hard this is.
- You can't begin to know!

00:25.892 --> 00:27.052
Surgery could kill you.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.527
I'm gonna find a surgeon
and get this thing out of my head.

00:47.981 --> 00:51.041
- Morning, sunshine.
- What...

00:53.720 --> 00:55.347
I'm sorry, um...

00:55.422 --> 00:59.654
- What, did you forget my name already?
- No... I just...

00:59.726 --> 01:01.421
This is a nice place.

01:01.895 --> 01:06.730
Thanks. It's, uh, yours. You banged
the headboard pretty hard that one time.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.428
Maybe you have a concussion.
Let me take a look.

01:09.502 --> 01:13.063
Will you just remind me what...
what exactly I had to drink last night

01:13.173 --> 01:17.269
and wh... why I didn't cut myself off
before incurring brain damage.

01:17.343 --> 01:21.575
You didn't have anything to drink
last night. You have rounds in an hour.

01:21.648 --> 01:25.607
- Rounds?
- Oh, I get it.

01:25.685 --> 01:27.050
That makes one of us.

01:27.153 --> 01:28.780
You seem so innocent at work,

01:28.855 --> 01:31.915
but you're all kinds of
naughty underneath your white coat.

01:32.826 --> 01:36.159
I imagine the only way
for bad Nurse Carrie

01:36.229 --> 01:40.723
to restore the sexy amnesiac's lost
memory is with a good old fashioned...

01:40.800 --> 01:42.233
Carrie, your name is Carrie.

01:42.302 --> 01:46.068
You're cute when you're weird.
I'm gonna have a quick shower.

01:46.139 --> 01:49.506
Why don't you take an aspirin,
then I'm gonna let you buy me breakfast.

01:54.347 --> 01:55.712
Dr. Stone.

02:00.587 --> 02:04.353
I was you. I looked in
the mirror and I saw your face.

02:04.457 --> 02:08.086
Put a sign up: "Objects in the mirror
are handsomer than they appear. "

02:08.161 --> 02:10.890
I realized I was in your
apartment on Divisadero.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.990
I loved that place.
I did so much damage in that place.

02:14.067 --> 02:18.299
Well, this morning I woke up with one
of the girls that you damaged: Carrie.

02:18.371 --> 02:21.704
Is this "Nate sleeping with
the girl you lost your virginity to,"

02:21.774 --> 02:23.401
- revenge fantasy?
- It wasn't.

02:23.476 --> 02:27.037
No, Eli, and it wasn't
a vision or a prophecy either.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.048
It was a sensory hallucination
brought on by your aneurysm.

02:30.116 --> 02:33.483
Sometimes, when I see people
in these sensory hallucinations,

02:33.553 --> 02:36.317
they usually have
some sort of legal problem.

02:36.389 --> 02:39.256
- I'm not being sued, Eli.
- Good. And Carrie?

02:39.325 --> 02:42.488
Last I heard she moved to Seattle.
I haven't seen her in ten years.

02:42.595 --> 02:45.655
- When did you even meet her?
- I didn't.

02:45.732 --> 02:49.293
Look, I've got a meeting with my boss,
all right? I'll call you later.

02:49.369 --> 02:53.328
Oh, but if you imagine Carrie again,
tell her to call me.

03:03.716 --> 03:06.981
- What is this?
- It's a dieffenbachia, king of plants.

03:07.053 --> 03:11.217
It's a "welcome back from your
personal week" gift. How was it?

03:14.127 --> 03:15.389
- Personal.
- Patti,

03:15.461 --> 03:17.019
I told you why I did what I did.

03:17.096 --> 03:19.428
Right, because God told you to.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.990
Did he look like
Morgan Freeman or George Burns?

03:22.068 --> 03:23.035
I made a mistake.

03:23.136 --> 03:26.902
A mistake that cost my friends
and neighbors their homes.

03:27.006 --> 03:31.375
I'm getting it out.
The, uh, you know what.

03:31.444 --> 03:34.413
I met with a surgeon last week.
A good one.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.348
- Is it safe?
- Just like getting your appendix out.

03:38.418 --> 03:43.117
If your appendix was buried
deep in a vital part of your brain.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.922
I'll be right back.

03:48.461 --> 03:52.420
The prodigal associate returns.
How was Ohio?

03:52.498 --> 03:55.433
Very pleasant. Thank you for asking.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.530
I was thinking we should discuss stuff.

03:59.138 --> 04:01.971
Supreme Court granted cert
in Lanning v. Codispodo.

04:02.041 --> 04:05.670
They say it will be one of next term's
most closely watched cases.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.771
Yeah, I already ordered
the pay-per-view.

04:08.848 --> 04:09.940
Are you feeling OK?

04:10.016 --> 04:13.577
Are you suggesting I've returned
from my trip somehow different?

04:14.454 --> 04:17.286
Only if you had a layover
in Stepford on your way back.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.587
Things are different, Eli.

04:19.659 --> 04:23.026
Yeah, because you kissed me,
and then I kissed you

04:23.096 --> 04:26.930
and then you responded by disappearing
halfway across the country for a week.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.968
That's not why things are different.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.472
You're a very confusing woman.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.502
Apparently.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.547
Moving on,
I see that we've been

04:41.648 --> 04:44.481
retained in connection
with the Asbury divorce case.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.576
The wife's side. We can
make the law journals with this.

04:47.654 --> 04:48.621
Don't be modest.

04:48.721 --> 04:52.157
This one's making the evening news.
Hope you're ready for your close-up.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.785
- I'm ready. I could use a second chair.
- I'm free.

04:56.095 --> 04:59.587
Um... I don't think I need someone
with your level of experience.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.190
I'll learn something new.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.963
I appreciate the offer, but I'd like...

05:04.871 --> 05:06.532
...Maggie.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.540
Oh, you would?

05:08.608 --> 05:11.509
Ms. Dekker it is, then.
As you appear to have the time,

05:11.577 --> 05:13.909
join me on
the Fenrich document production.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.346
All 2,000 pages worth.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.348
Oh.

05:20.586 --> 05:25.023
What was that? At the staff meeting,
you boxing me out.

05:25.091 --> 05:26.217
"Boxing you out?"

05:26.292 --> 05:29.125
It's a basketball term.
It means keeping me out of the paint.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.459
I know what it means.
I played varsity forward.

05:31.531 --> 05:35.695
Sweet. You still have your short shorts?

05:35.802 --> 05:39.568
This is the third case of mine you've
tried worming your way onto in a week.

05:39.672 --> 05:44.632
I know. I thought since we both
obviously get off on working together...

05:44.711 --> 05:48.147
Two choices: Stop bringing that up,
or get used to eating through a straw.

05:48.214 --> 05:51.240
Oh, come on, admit it,
you had a good time.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.410
Several good times, if I recall.

05:53.486 --> 05:56.512
And if you want me to back off,
you're gonna have to do a lot better

05:56.589 --> 05:57.886
than "it was a mistake. "

05:57.957 --> 06:00.323
OK, how about we work together?

06:00.426 --> 06:02.485
Hmm. That didn't seem
to stop you and Stone.

06:02.562 --> 06:06.521
I wasn't working here when it started.
My father would never have approved.

06:06.632 --> 06:10.898
So your father's the only thing standing
between us and... short shorts?

06:12.038 --> 06:13.198
Unfortunately.

06:13.306 --> 06:17.470
Got it. Thanks for giving it to me
straight. Have a nice rest of your day.

06:24.817 --> 06:26.751
What's with the look?

06:27.754 --> 06:30.917
Last time you looked like that,
you told me I had a brain aneurysm.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.015
I'm a little concerned.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.959
You know that meeting I was
on my way to this morning?

06:36.028 --> 06:37.996
The one with my boss, Trevor Snyder?

06:38.698 --> 06:40.791
It was about a former patient of mine,

06:40.867 --> 06:43.768
Karen Masters. She died.

06:43.836 --> 06:46.862
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too. She was a nice lady.

06:46.939 --> 06:48.873
And you're taking it hard?

06:48.941 --> 06:51.375
I did when she died three months ago.

06:51.444 --> 06:54.470
See, I'm the UNOS coordinator
at St. Vincent's...

06:54.547 --> 06:56.913
That's, uh, organ transplants, right?

06:56.983 --> 07:01.886
Karen was first on the transplant list
when a donor heart became available.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.081
- What went wrong?
- Nothing, nothing.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.250
Another woman,
who was lower on the list,

07:06.325 --> 07:10.489
took a turn for the worse. I moved
her up into first position over Karen.

07:10.596 --> 07:15.556
She got the heart, Karen didn't.
She lived...

07:15.635 --> 07:17.660
And Karen didn't.

07:17.737 --> 07:20.706
It must be tough,
having to make those decisions.

07:20.807 --> 07:25.107
It is. And that was before
I started getting sued for making them.

07:25.178 --> 07:29.615
Karen's husband, her... widower,

07:29.682 --> 07:31.240
he's, uh... he's suing me.

07:33.252 --> 07:34.583
You mean I was right?

07:34.654 --> 07:37.521
Now would not be a good time
for that conversation.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.152
I am in real trouble here, Eli.

07:43.563 --> 07:46.259
Last week you asked me
to take your life in my hands.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.392
You said that you had faith in me.
Well, when it comes to lawyering,

07:49.469 --> 07:51.232
and probably only lawyering...

07:52.905 --> 07:55.271
...I have faith in you.

07:55.374 --> 07:57.899
So, what do you say?

07:58.945 --> 08:01.311
Looks like you've
hired yourself a lawyer.

08:10.923 --> 08:13.949
I want to thank you for asking me
to join you on this case.

08:14.026 --> 08:16.688
I've mostly worked under men
at the firm, like Eli,

08:16.762 --> 08:20.323
but I've always felt I would
really benefit from the experience

08:20.433 --> 08:22.799
of working alongside an older woman.

08:22.902 --> 08:27.134
Well, not older as in old.
I meant older, like, seasoned.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.141
I understand why you eat lunch
at your desk alone.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.613
- Just the person I wanted to talk to.
- Need something work related?

08:36.716 --> 08:39.207
Come on, Maggie, I know
what's different about you.

08:39.284 --> 08:42.015
- You do?
- Yeah. Did you get a haircut?

08:42.922 --> 08:47.188
You know what, Eli? For a guy who claims
to have extra-sensory perception...

08:47.260 --> 08:49.751
Maggie. They're waiting for us.

08:52.565 --> 08:55.227
Patti, do you notice anything
strange about Maggie?

08:55.301 --> 08:57.861
I don't notice anything
other than strange.

08:57.937 --> 09:02.101
- No, I mean, like something different?
- Of course there is.

09:02.174 --> 09:03.664
That would be what, exactly?

09:03.743 --> 09:06.644
Can they fix your brain tomorrow
by any chance?

09:06.712 --> 09:11.615
This doesn't add up. Could you pass me
the Berkman quarterly profit breakdown?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.883
Thank you.

09:15.955 --> 09:20.119
You know, these Unidac corporate
acquisitions remind me of a hypothetical

09:20.226 --> 09:23.559
I once argued for moot court
back in law school.

09:23.629 --> 09:27.588
- I'm all ears.
- There's this big, powerful company.

09:27.700 --> 09:31.397
In the moot court fact pattern,
it was called ParentCo.

09:31.470 --> 09:36.373
ParentCo has a particularly
attractive subsidiary.

09:36.442 --> 09:41.209
For the purposes of this hypothetical,
let's call it... Daughter Inc.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.740
Daughter Inc. Receives... feelers

09:45.818 --> 09:49.777
from a corporate suitor
who couldn't value her assets

09:49.855 --> 09:51.618
more highly.

09:52.458 --> 09:56.792
Hypothetically,
how would ParentCo look upon, um,

09:56.862 --> 10:01.925
this suitor pursuing a merger
with Daughter Inc?

10:05.504 --> 10:08.064
Let there be no misunderstanding,
Mr. Dowd.

10:08.140 --> 10:12.304
ParentCo would do everything
in its considerable power

10:12.378 --> 10:17.645
to protect Daughter Inc.
So soon after her recent failed merger.

10:17.717 --> 10:22.086
In short, ParentCo
would not hesitate to crush

10:22.154 --> 10:27.786
any suitor who sought to merge
with Daughter Inc. At this juncture.

10:29.662 --> 10:32.028
Hypothetically.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.565
It's fun stuff... hypotheticals.

10:37.670 --> 10:40.935
According to the prenup,
she cheated first, so she gets nothing.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.771
- Not one penny.
- Change the channel already, Sean.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.606
Elliott, control your client.

10:45.711 --> 10:48.680
He has every right to his emotion.
His wife of five years

10:48.748 --> 10:51.478
arranged a hotel assignation
with a man she met online.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.280
- Who happened to be her own husband.
- Wait.

10:55.254 --> 10:59.122
Dana, I mean, our client, tried to cheat
on her husband with her husband?

10:59.191 --> 11:02.888
Your client didn't know the man
she was seducing was Mr. Asbury.

11:02.962 --> 11:05.328
She thought she was meeting
"ClooneyDouble32."

11:05.398 --> 11:07.423
Who is your client and her husband.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.401
And who is 36 and looks
nothing like George Clooney.

11:10.469 --> 11:12.835
You described your build as athletic.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.964
Point is, it's no harm, no foul.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.874
There isn't any "no harm, no foul"
clause in the prenup.

11:17.943 --> 11:20.639
There is a fidelity clause
which clearly states

11:20.713 --> 11:24.945
that whichever spouse is unfaithful
first forfeits any claims to the assets.

11:25.017 --> 11:28.544
- First to stray is the one to pay.
- Even with her own husband?

11:28.621 --> 11:31.317
- Welcome to the 21 st century.
- Welcome to litigation.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.358
I'll schedule the depositions.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.391
Dr. Stone was doing his job.

11:36.462 --> 11:39.226
Without an allegation
of negligence or malfeasance,

11:39.331 --> 11:42.198
you can't sue him
for exercising his discretion.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.566
Oh, I can sue him. I know because I did.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.605
I meant to say you can't sue and win.

11:46.672 --> 11:51.041
You promised us. You looked me in
the eye and you told me Karen was next.

11:51.110 --> 11:54.045
- Howard, I didn't say that.
- You told me to have hope.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.581
The next day you gave
that hope to someone else.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.413
Doctors have discretion in these cases,
Mr. Masters.

11:59.518 --> 12:03.284
- The law doesn't second guess.
- It does when there's misconduct.

12:03.355 --> 12:05.687
A patient's status can change abruptly.

12:05.758 --> 12:08.283
Someone comes along
whose need is more urgent.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.523
Karen died three days after
the heart she was supposed to get

12:11.630 --> 12:15.122
went to someone else. How much
more urgent did she need to be?

12:15.201 --> 12:16.930
Mr. Masters, Dr. Stone...

12:17.002 --> 12:18.629
- Is your brother?
- Yes.

12:18.704 --> 12:23.664
If having your brother represent you was
meant to earn some sympathy, forget it.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.140
- My sympathy died with Karen.
- You can't honestly...

12:27.246 --> 12:30.613
Why? Why did you do it?

12:30.716 --> 12:33.082
What made that woman more deserving?

12:33.152 --> 12:36.781
My client won't be speaking.
What is it you're looking for?

12:36.856 --> 12:39.791
A reckoning.
In the biblical sense of the term.

12:39.859 --> 12:43.761
An eye for an eye or,
in this case, a heart for a heart.

12:43.829 --> 12:48.198
And by your heart, I mean your
brother's money and his reputation.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.100
We'll be seeing you gentlemen in court.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.179
I've been practicing for ten years,
and I haven't been sued.

13:06.252 --> 13:10.621
And I thought at least, when I did get
sued, it would be because I screwed up.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.658
Nate, I have to ask.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.024
Is there anything about this
you haven't told me?

13:16.962 --> 13:17.929
No.

13:18.697 --> 13:22.258
Ostrow seems confident for a guy
who doesn't have the law on his side.

13:22.334 --> 13:25.303
I didn't do anything wrong, Eli.

13:25.404 --> 13:29.340
Doctors get sued all the time. Doesn't
matter if they made a mistake or not.

13:46.358 --> 13:49.122
Nate? Nate?

13:50.729 --> 13:52.094
Where'd you go?

13:53.833 --> 13:54.959
Huh?

13:55.034 --> 13:57.867
You sure you're all right?
You seem really out of it.

13:57.937 --> 14:00.804
I'm fine.
I'm just, I'm just hungry.

14:04.510 --> 14:08.378
God, I still can't believe it.
She was so beautiful.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.645
It's ten years ago.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.050
What's ten years ago?

14:14.820 --> 14:16.981
Now. It's ten years ago.

14:17.089 --> 14:21.185
That's it. When we get to work,
you're going right into an MRI.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.995
You, you gonna get that?

14:26.098 --> 14:28.726
- Oh, that's... that's me.
- Mmm.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.299
- Hello?
- Nate?

14:36.375 --> 14:40.903
Mom? Yeah, yeah, it's Nate. What's up?

14:40.980 --> 14:44.814
There's been an accident, honey.
It's your dad. His car...

14:44.884 --> 14:49.787
It's bad. You need to get over here
right away. I'm at Golden Gate Heights.

14:49.855 --> 14:53.018
Hurry, honey. Be careful.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.322
What is it?

15:00.099 --> 15:03.535
Today's the day my father died.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.742
Hey.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.151
How's the?

15:22.221 --> 15:25.850
Oh, it's still in there.
It's kind of stubborn.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.450
Like its owner.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.264
I shouldn't have yelled at you
the other week.

15:32.998 --> 15:36.263
All the stuff I'm doing 'cause I may
be America's Next Top Prophet,

15:36.335 --> 15:38.565
you didn't make me do any of it.

15:40.306 --> 15:44.868
I found a doctor.
I'm getting it taken out.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.469
Mazeltov.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.341
So, what's up?

15:51.684 --> 15:54.847
George Michael asked me
to represent him last week.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.581
He said he had a dream about me.

15:58.223 --> 16:00.987
- Probably just a coincidence.
- Probably.

16:01.093 --> 16:04.756
Anything else?
Any actual visions since the earthquake?

16:04.830 --> 16:09.927
Well, I... I may be kind of,
sort of, having Nate's flashbacks.

16:10.002 --> 16:11.663
What was that again?

16:11.737 --> 16:15.605
I'm having Nate's flashbacks
of the day our father died,

16:15.674 --> 16:18.336
at the same time I'm representing him.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.669
Again, what an odd coincidence.

16:20.746 --> 16:23.306
OK, let's say it isn't.
What would it mean?

16:23.415 --> 16:26.179
What do you remember
from the day your father passed away?

16:26.251 --> 16:28.719
Nothing. I wasn't there.

16:28.787 --> 16:32.086
It was two days before the Bar exam.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.717
Bad timing, my dad's specialty.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.853
And Nate and my mom
told me not to come back.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.768
He was gone by the time
I finally made it home.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.063
Someone wants you to know
what happened that day.

16:48.607 --> 16:51.371
Why don't you try
talking to your brother about it?

16:52.211 --> 16:53.473
Oh, ladies.

16:53.946 --> 16:57.575
- Oh, Matt, we're late for a depo.
- Well, I only need a second.

17:01.854 --> 17:05.221
The thing we discussed earlier.
The impediment?

17:05.324 --> 17:06.984
I've opened negotiations.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.887
You talked to my father about it?

17:09.962 --> 17:13.329
I just thought I'd keep you updated.
See you later.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.133
Is everything OK?

17:22.207 --> 17:24.767
I just mean,
if you wanted to talk or something.

17:24.843 --> 17:27.175
Matt and I slept together last week.

17:27.246 --> 17:30.113
- Oh, wow.
- Anyway, now he wants to date,

17:30.182 --> 17:34.050
and my whole fake reason
for not being able to might be a bust.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.514
Did you ask me
to work on this case with you

17:37.589 --> 17:39.887
so you wouldn't have
to work on it with Matt?

17:42.261 --> 17:43.421
If I answer "no,"

17:43.495 --> 17:47.261
would that prevent you from
ever uttering a word of this to Eli?

17:47.332 --> 17:49.800
I was just curious.

17:49.868 --> 17:54.396
Well, the ISP records indicate
that you spent 20 hours a week online.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.408
- Must've been pretty curious.
- Whether I was or wasn't,

17:57.476 --> 18:00.001
- I still met Sean.
- You met "ClooneyDouble32."

18:00.079 --> 18:03.242
- They're one and the same.
- Do we have to go through this again?

18:03.348 --> 18:06.647
You know, actually,
I want to answer his question.

18:06.718 --> 18:07.742
You're right.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.586
I didn't know I was really talking
to Sean. I mean, how could I have?

18:11.690 --> 18:13.851
I haven't seen that
side of him in years.

18:15.994 --> 18:20.954
This man, he would
ask me about my life,

18:21.033 --> 18:25.299
my dreams. He even told me that I
should try talking to my husband again.

18:26.638 --> 18:30.074
There was an honesty,
there was warmth.

18:30.142 --> 18:32.474
This warmth wasn't enough
for you, was it?

18:32.544 --> 18:35.445
You proposed meeting in real life.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.175
Yes. It was my idea.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.683
What were your
intentions upon meeting?

18:39.751 --> 18:42.242
- I don't know.
- Engaging in adultery.

18:45.257 --> 18:47.691
All I know is that I wanted to feel

18:47.759 --> 18:50.694
as wanted as Sean used to make me.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.764
It's called the death rattle.

18:58.837 --> 19:02.068
Fluid builds up in the voice box,

19:02.141 --> 19:06.168
and it made Karen
make this horrible rasp,

19:06.245 --> 19:09.612
- and then...
- Your wife was gone.

19:15.721 --> 19:21.091
Mr. Masters, why do you blame
Dr. Stone for your wife's death?

19:21.193 --> 19:24.526
He said, given Karen's
deteriorating condition,

19:24.596 --> 19:26.860
that she would get
the next heart for sure.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.661
- But she didn't.
- No.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.964
He gave Karen's heart to someone else.

19:31.036 --> 19:32.298
Do you have any idea why?

19:32.371 --> 19:36.205
I think Dr. Stone decided
that my wife didn't deserve to live

19:36.275 --> 19:40.575
once he discovered that she
had a drinking problem.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.513
Are you sure Dr. Stone knew that?

19:43.582 --> 19:48.315
On her death bed, Karen said that she
had confessed her alcoholism to him.

19:48.387 --> 19:53.552
She said it was probably the reason
he gave her heart to someone else.

20:01.867 --> 20:06.201
"Objection!" I've seen it
a zillion times on Law & Order.

20:06.271 --> 20:09.570
- They hid this grenade...
- We're admitting it's a grenade.

20:09.641 --> 20:12.405
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It was privileged information.

20:12.477 --> 20:13.444
Not anymore.

20:13.545 --> 20:17.777
Is this? Did you give that woman's
heart to someone else because of Dad?

20:17.849 --> 20:19.612
Don't go bringing Dad into this.

20:19.685 --> 20:22.813
That's their next move.
They're gonna say you're biased.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.186
This medical decision
had nothing to do with Dad.

20:25.257 --> 20:28.818
Nate, there's not a lot we do in life
that doesn't have to do with Dad.

20:28.927 --> 20:33.057
Remember how I said I saw myself in
your apartment with that girl, Carrie?

20:33.131 --> 20:34.894
It was the day Dad died.

20:36.001 --> 20:39.459
- I don't know what it means.
- You have got to be kidding me.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.701
I wasn't there when Dad died.
You were. Something happened.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.276
You want to know what you don't know?

20:45.344 --> 20:48.404
You don't know that
these visions of yours are crap.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.779
You also don't seem to know that
my career, my life, is on the line.

20:51.850 --> 20:55.411
You wouldn't be dumping me
with this paranoia about how Dad died.

20:55.487 --> 20:59.753
Right now, what I don't know is why the
hell I trusted you in the first place.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.994
Understand, we are not
having this conversation.

21:12.070 --> 21:15.437
I will deny ever having said
what I'm about to say to you.

21:15.540 --> 21:19.601
I have reason to believe that my
daughter is involved with someone else.

21:19.678 --> 21:21.236
Someone in this office.

21:21.313 --> 21:24.248
Someone we'd both prefer
she not become involved with.

21:24.316 --> 21:28.047
Now, it would be entirely inappropriate

21:28.120 --> 21:29.883
for me to do anything about this.

21:29.988 --> 21:33.947
However, if a certain coworker here...

21:34.026 --> 21:38.190
- Matt Dowd.
- How did you know?

21:38.297 --> 21:42.165
I saw them singing I Got You Babe
at a karaoke bar in my head.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.498
It's a long story.
Sir, if you'll excuse me,

21:44.569 --> 21:49.529
I have to go and yell at somebody
and then go kill someone else.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.417
- Matt Dowd!
- What are you talking about?

22:00.485 --> 22:03.943
I Got You Babe! Well,
I guess he really did get you, babe!

22:04.022 --> 22:06.786
I'm not entirely sure
that's any of your business, Eli.

22:06.892 --> 22:09.793
- You're my former fiancée.
- Yes. Former, as in no longer.

22:09.861 --> 22:12.022
- We broke up three weeks ago!
- Two months.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.861
The break up confirmation
happened three weeks ago!

22:14.933 --> 22:17.493
Then you go and sleep
with someone that we work with?

22:17.569 --> 22:21.130
Are you pissed that I slept with someone
that works here or with anyone?

22:21.239 --> 22:25.608
Maggie, just out of curiosity, did you
text Eli the second I turned around?

22:25.677 --> 22:29.113
- Did you give him the news in person?
- What? No! I... I didn't tell him.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.706
- I swear, I would never!
- You knew about her and Dowd?

22:31.783 --> 22:32.875
No.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.654
Fine, yes. But I didn't tell you.

22:36.755 --> 22:39.383
- You going with "a vision told me"?
- Told him what?

22:41.693 --> 22:43.786
I take it there's a bag missing a cat.

22:43.862 --> 22:47.195
I swear I didn't tell anyone!
Not even my goldfish, Maggie.

22:47.265 --> 22:51.031
- Cut the "cute and clueless" routine.
- Don't yell at her. She didn't tell me.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.263
Then who did?

22:52.337 --> 22:56.296
I came to get a bagel and tell you I'm
gonna take another stab at our problem.

22:56.408 --> 22:58.740
Matt, please stop talking to my father!

22:58.810 --> 23:02.109
I'm not gonna go out with you.
I told you that so you'd stop asking me.

23:02.981 --> 23:07.475
It's cool. I get it. Nicely done.

23:10.255 --> 23:12.314
Eli, next time, stay out of my business.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.292
It's difficult when you sleep
with people we work with.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.921
- Without taking them to Hawaii first?
- We never did anything.

23:18.997 --> 23:20.021
Nothing happened!

23:20.098 --> 23:23.864
Are you about to tell me that nothing
is going on between you and Maggie?

23:23.969 --> 23:28.338
Nothing is going on between me and...
Is that an engagement ring?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.102
Heck of a time to notice.

23:31.877 --> 23:36.576
Interesting that she didn't tell you.
I'm sure there's nothing to that.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.410
Why didn't you tell me?

23:39.518 --> 23:42.214
I've been wearing the ring
since I got back.

23:42.287 --> 23:45.620
Without saying a word. You're
engaged to a guy I never even met.

23:45.690 --> 23:49.854
As it happens, I have a whole entire
life outside of this office and you.

23:49.961 --> 23:53.294
I seem to recall you dragging
my lips into your outside life.

23:53.799 --> 23:56.632
It was a mistake.
A mistake we both made.

23:56.701 --> 24:01.661
But it doesn't mean anything.
It just means that we had a moment.

24:02.674 --> 24:05.006
And the moment's over.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.073
Of course,
I wanted her to get the heart.

24:11.149 --> 24:15.677
I want every patient on the waiting list
to get a heart, or a kidney,

24:15.754 --> 24:18.484
or a pair of corneas,
whatever it is they need.

24:18.557 --> 24:21.321
That's why I became
the UNOS coordinator.

24:21.393 --> 24:24.157
That's why I became a doctor.
To save lives.

24:24.262 --> 24:28.722
Dr. Stone, did you promise Karen Masters
she would receive a heart?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.768
No. I can't make
those kinds of promises.

24:30.836 --> 24:34.328
And why did you give
the heart to someone else?

24:35.106 --> 24:39.770
I didn't give it to anyone.
It wasn't mine to give.

24:39.845 --> 24:43.747
What I did do was reprioritize
another patient over Karen

24:43.815 --> 24:47.717
- because she got sicker.
- And just so we're all clear,

24:47.786 --> 24:52.348
what role did the fact that Karen
was an alcoholic play in your decision?

24:52.424 --> 24:53.391
None whatsoever.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.325
- It's hard to prove a negative.
- Not in this case.

24:56.394 --> 24:59.761
If I wanted to make sure that Karen
wouldn't get the heart,

24:59.865 --> 25:03.824
or any heart, I would have disclosed
her drinking problem on her UNOS form.

25:03.935 --> 25:05.197
Why didn't you?

25:05.270 --> 25:08.137
Alcoholism is a condition
with a lot of shame attached to it.

25:08.206 --> 25:10.231
Believe me, I...

25:12.043 --> 25:14.477
I know, and...

25:14.546 --> 25:17.071
I wanted to protect her privacy.

25:20.585 --> 25:23.850
You did know that she was an alcoholic
at the time of her death?

25:23.922 --> 25:27.619
- I did.
- So why did you conceal it, doctor?

25:27.692 --> 25:31.219
Isn't it mandatory you disclose
that information on her UNOS form?

25:31.296 --> 25:34.265
I didn't want Karen to get
kicked off the list completely.

25:34.366 --> 25:38.097
Dr. Stone, true or false?
Your father was an alcoholic.

25:39.538 --> 25:43.099
Yes... my father had a drinking problem.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.905
But, if anything, that makes me
more sympathetic towards alcoholics.

25:46.978 --> 25:50.072
Really? So if I were to call your boss
to the stand, would he agree?

25:50.849 --> 25:52.749
What about your brother?

25:52.817 --> 25:56.981
I have affidavits from ten
past and present colleagues,

25:57.088 --> 26:00.148
professors and friends
all stating how deeply

26:00.225 --> 26:02.455
you resented your father
for his drinking.

26:02.527 --> 26:05.690
Some even went so far
as to use the word "despised. "

26:05.764 --> 26:09.996
My father had nothing to do
with Karen not getting a heart!

26:10.068 --> 26:11.831
Of course.

26:11.903 --> 26:16.363
And, uh, we can all see how
objective you are on the subject.

26:17.809 --> 26:19.299
Nothing further.

26:22.647 --> 26:25.616
Don't say it.
You even start to say "I told you so"

26:25.717 --> 26:28.379
and I am violating my
Hippocratic Oath on your jaw.

26:28.453 --> 26:30.614
Why didn't you disclose the alcoholism?

26:30.722 --> 26:32.690
I'm not having this discussion.

26:32.757 --> 26:35.453
You're the one who said
you're on trial for your career.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.291
I can't help you if you're
not telling me everything.

26:38.363 --> 26:40.524
Eli!

26:40.632 --> 26:43.760
I told you and everyone else
what you needed to know.

26:43.835 --> 26:45.564
I protected Karen Masters.

26:45.637 --> 26:48.504
And then someone else got sicker,
had to be bumped up the list.

26:48.573 --> 26:52.532
All of this is just my bad luck,
which I seem to have caught from you.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.712
I'm taking the stairs.

27:08.927 --> 27:12.454
Oh, I am so not in the mood right now!

27:12.764 --> 27:17.701
Dr. Philips, 2421.
Dr. Philips, 2421.

27:24.442 --> 27:26.672
Nate.

27:29.414 --> 27:30.938
Oh, Nate.

27:32.984 --> 27:34.508
I'm so glad you're here.

27:40.358 --> 27:44.317
- Nate, this is Dr. Francis.
- Hi, Dr. Stone.

27:44.429 --> 27:47.728
I've just been updating your mother
on what our options are.

27:47.799 --> 27:48.766
OK.

27:48.867 --> 27:53.099
Ejection fraction is 30 percent.
His chest X-ray shows volume overload.

27:53.171 --> 27:56.140
We gave him TPA and Lasix
to take off some of the fluids,

27:56.207 --> 27:59.665
but he's been left with very
little functioning myocardium.

28:00.145 --> 28:01.510
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

28:02.447 --> 28:05.007
I mean, I follow, 'cause I'm Dr. Stone.

28:05.083 --> 28:07.449
My mother probably doesn't follow.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.520
Well, it's no surprise
his heart gave out on him.

28:13.024 --> 28:16.323
I always...
I thought he was in a car accident.

28:16.394 --> 28:17.884
Following an acute MI.

28:18.930 --> 28:20.363
He had a heart attack?

28:21.132 --> 28:24.590
His only chance at any long-term
survival is with a transplant.

28:26.571 --> 28:29.734
I'm going to call Eli and tell him.

28:38.516 --> 28:41.952
I have no idea
what I'm going to tell him.

28:43.722 --> 28:47.453
It's OK. I wanted to talk
to you alone anyway.

28:47.525 --> 28:50.153
It seems like God
is on your father's side.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.162
- What do you mean?
- A teenager,

28:52.230 --> 28:54.721
neurovegetative state
after a GSW to the head.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.865
His family is taking him off
life support. He's an organ donor.

28:58.937 --> 29:02.270
You mean you could
give my dad this kid's heart?

29:02.340 --> 29:04.103
It's as good a match as we can hope.

29:04.175 --> 29:06.507
We don't know how your father will react

29:06.578 --> 29:09.741
to the immunosuppressant
necessary to stave off rejection.

29:11.149 --> 29:15.518
Dr. Stone, I know that you're aware
that the timing here is critical.

29:15.587 --> 29:19.023
Your dad would be at the top of the list
given his circumstances.

29:26.131 --> 29:28.361
Dr. Stone...

29:32.570 --> 29:35.038
What do you want to do?

29:47.085 --> 29:51.181
You can't keep coming over at all hours,
barging in like a lunatic and...

29:51.256 --> 29:54.225
I know about Dad's heart.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.320
...stuff like that.

29:58.396 --> 30:01.695
Look, um, Eli, wait.
Whatever you think...

30:01.766 --> 30:04.530
I think that Dad wasn't drunk
the night of his car accident.

30:04.636 --> 30:08.595
I think he had a heart attack. And I
think he could have had a transplant.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.944
Yeah.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.811
He could have.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.685
I'm glad you know now.

30:24.756 --> 30:27.816
- Killing our father hasn't been...
- You didn't kill him.

30:27.892 --> 30:30.122
I stopped him from
getting what he needed.

30:30.195 --> 30:35.064
Trust me, I'm a trained
medical professional and I...

30:36.568 --> 30:39.503
- I killed him.
- It would have been wasted on him.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.937
Yeah, yeah.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.668
Tell yourself that in the night
when you can't sleep.

30:44.742 --> 30:47.711
Tell yourself the reasons
why it was the right decision.

30:47.779 --> 30:51.943
Like, um, he needed a healthy liver
for the transplant to take.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.415
Dad was an alcoholic...

30:53.484 --> 30:57.648
- Dad was never gonna stop drinking.
- Yeah, yeah. I told myself that, too.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.729
- Did you talk to Mom or something?
- No.

31:06.798 --> 31:08.698
I haven't spoken
to her in over a week.

31:09.901 --> 31:13.064
Not counting creepy flashback visions.

31:14.639 --> 31:17.335
So you're saying...

31:17.408 --> 31:18.705
You're really saying...

31:18.776 --> 31:23.475
It was the aneurysm.
It's how I found out.

31:24.415 --> 31:25.973
This happen to you a lot?

31:26.050 --> 31:29.417
Usually, during a trial.
And with this trial...

31:31.990 --> 31:33.423
...I have to ask...

31:34.826 --> 31:39.263
Did I make the same choice
for Karen Masters that I made for Dad?

31:50.541 --> 31:54.910
She'd been in the hospital four days
before she started experiencing tremors

31:54.979 --> 31:57.106
and other signs of alcohol withdrawal.

31:57.181 --> 31:59.411
That's when you
bumped the other woman up?

32:00.985 --> 32:02.919
Karen chose, Eli.

32:04.022 --> 32:05.785
She made her own choice.

32:05.890 --> 32:09.257
She made me promise never to tell her
husband, he'd never understand.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.624
And I guess she was right.

32:13.998 --> 32:17.331
Any idea how dangerous it was
to keep this from me?

32:18.803 --> 32:19.963
We could lose the case.

32:21.139 --> 32:24.370
Either way, someone was gonna die
and someone was gonna live.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.933
I guess I was hoping
that a jury wouldn't punish me

32:27.011 --> 32:31.573
because, uh... because I made
the best choice I could.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.913
You know something?
If this goes the wrong way,

32:37.989 --> 32:40.253
you may have a future as a lawyer.

32:40.325 --> 32:43.852
Dad, I need to talk to you
about a certain lawyer.

32:43.928 --> 32:46.192
I employ a small army.
Which one did you have in mind?

32:46.264 --> 32:49.563
Matt Dowd. I know he approached you.

32:49.634 --> 32:53.092
With a "hypothetical. " Truthfully,
I expected him to be less of a wuss.

32:53.171 --> 32:55.833
Please, tell me nothing happened
between the two of you.

32:57.108 --> 33:01.204
Oh, my God.
You told Eli about me and Matt.

33:02.013 --> 33:04.641
That's a mental picture I'd rather...

33:04.716 --> 33:08.482
OK. I told Eli. And I told him
I'd kill him if he said anything.

33:08.586 --> 33:13.148
I just thought that deep down,
you still wanted Eli to fight for you.

33:13.224 --> 33:15.454
Dad! Stay out of it.

33:16.527 --> 33:19.496
God, I'm late for a depo.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.031
- It was a fantasy.
- Please describe

33:23.134 --> 33:26.001
what happened the day
you showed up at the Fairmont Hotel.

33:26.971 --> 33:29.804
Well, I thought I was
going to meet my soul mate.

33:29.874 --> 33:32.843
- Instead, I found my wife.
- What do you mean?

33:32.910 --> 33:35.845
I mean, I thought I was
going to meet "BookLover13."

33:35.913 --> 33:39.815
Say what you want, but that woman
I met online was not my wife.

33:39.884 --> 33:43.843
This person was... She was vivid.

33:43.955 --> 33:47.322
She was funny. She had insights.

33:47.392 --> 33:51.260
It got to where I was jonesing
for whatever she'd type next.

33:51.329 --> 33:54.162
You know what?
This is all so ridiculous.

33:54.232 --> 33:56.757
We've been over this,
the flirtation was virtual...

33:56.834 --> 33:59.200
No, I'm talking about us being here.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.468
- I'm not sure I follow.
- I know I don't.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.509
It is a big world.
These two people found each other in it.

34:05.610 --> 34:09.569
Not once, but twice.
Do you know how incredibly hard that is?

34:09.647 --> 34:12.581
You listen to what the universe
is telling you here.

34:14.518 --> 34:16.679
- What are you doing?
- I'm recusing myself.

34:16.754 --> 34:18.312
- And so is she.
- I am?

34:19.590 --> 34:23.617
- And so are you. For 72 hours.
- You're kidding.

34:23.694 --> 34:28.255
Look, if after the next three days
you two still hate each other, fine.

34:28.331 --> 34:30.493
We'll proceed with the divorce.

34:30.568 --> 34:34.527
But I strongly encourage you
to talk to each other.

34:34.639 --> 34:39.268
No chatrooms, no screen names. Just
use this time to talk to each other.

34:39.342 --> 34:42.437
There's a reason you two
keep falling in love.

34:48.152 --> 34:50.712
Could you please state
your name for the record?

34:50.822 --> 34:52.289
Dina Michelle Allston.

34:52.356 --> 34:54.984
Your Honor,
I renew my objection to this witness.

34:55.059 --> 34:57.527
And I renew my overruling
of your objection.

34:57.595 --> 35:01.429
- Mr. Stone, proceed.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

35:06.571 --> 35:08.903
I don't actually have any questions.

35:10.508 --> 35:14.968
I just wanted the jury to meet
the woman who did receive the heart.

35:17.081 --> 35:20.448
These are not decisions that
anyone should have to make.

35:20.551 --> 35:23.884
Yet doctors are asked
to make them every day.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.445
They're asked to play God.

35:26.491 --> 35:29.619
Karen Masters' death was a tragedy.

35:29.694 --> 35:32.162
No one here believes otherwise.

35:33.231 --> 35:35.699
But for all the talk of a life lost,

35:35.766 --> 35:39.327
no one should forget
that a life was also saved.

35:40.037 --> 35:43.473
And despite what Nathan Stone
has been alleged to have taken

35:43.541 --> 35:45.099
from Mr. Masters,

35:45.176 --> 35:48.543
it should be remembered what
he gave back to Dina Allston.

35:48.613 --> 35:52.071
Could any of us
look Dr. Stone in the eye,

35:52.150 --> 35:55.916
could you look at Dina in the eye...

35:56.687 --> 35:58.848
...and tell them
that a mistake was made?

36:16.140 --> 36:18.870
In the matter of Howard Masters
versus Nathan Stone,

36:18.943 --> 36:21.878
on the counts
of breach of obligation,

36:21.946 --> 36:24.210
and infliction of emotional distress,

36:24.282 --> 36:28.719
we, the jury,
find in favor of the defendant.

36:31.656 --> 36:36.958
Now might be a good time to mention
I stole your Boba Fett when I was 11.

36:43.801 --> 36:45.769
Howard.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.198
I'm so sorry.

36:50.274 --> 36:53.937
All I want is for you
to feel like I feel.

36:54.011 --> 36:56.070
I hope you do one day.

36:57.515 --> 36:58.482
That hurt.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.744
Finding out you
were throwing your dad,

37:00.818 --> 37:05.152
who I think took out a contract
on my life... up as a roadblock.

37:05.223 --> 37:09.387
I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd be crazy
enough to say anything to my father.

37:09.927 --> 37:13.590
It's just, you know,
that road has to go both ways.

37:13.664 --> 37:16.633
Hmm. See, that's the thing.

37:18.102 --> 37:20.161
- I think it does.
- Matt...

37:20.238 --> 37:23.696
I mean, sure, first I thought,
"She's not into the Dowd. "

37:23.774 --> 37:26.538
But then I realized,
if some part of you wasn't into me,

37:26.611 --> 37:30.547
why would you have been so nervous
about us working together to begin with?

37:30.615 --> 37:34.107
- I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
- Exactly.

37:34.185 --> 37:37.621
You never worried about my feelings
before we slept together.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.519
It was just sex.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.354
No, no, no. I've had "just sex. "

37:42.460 --> 37:45.190
Generally speaking,
it's mostly all I've had.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.288
But what we had...

37:48.499 --> 37:50.660
...was something else.

37:51.535 --> 37:53.093
It wasn't.

38:01.879 --> 38:05.042
I get it. You've got
some stuff to work through.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.142
I just thought I'd stop by and say...

38:09.287 --> 38:11.448
...work through it.

38:14.859 --> 38:16.986
Sometimes, things surprise you.

38:17.061 --> 38:20.963
I read this article about these,
uh, scientists at Duke.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.296
They discovered what your appendix does.

38:23.367 --> 38:25.267
That's not all that interesting.

38:25.336 --> 38:28.863
They say it cultivates
good bacteria for digestion.

38:28.939 --> 38:32.636
It's not just a useless leftover.

38:32.710 --> 38:35.838
But yesterday,
I would've told you with certainty

38:35.913 --> 38:38.074
that your appendix meant nothing.

38:39.483 --> 38:42.509
Turns out, science isn't always right.

38:43.654 --> 38:47.954
That's a reassuring sentiment on
the eve of my impending brain surgery.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.484
I'm not sure you
should have the operation.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.926
Something's happening with you.
I don't know what.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.161
I wouldn't even begin to guess why.

38:58.269 --> 39:00.294
But what you knew about me and Dad...

39:01.305 --> 39:04.536
...I can tell you with
absolute medical certainty

39:04.608 --> 39:06.576
that it's impossible.

39:06.644 --> 39:10.671
Unless it's beyond science.

39:12.983 --> 39:14.917
Then what do you think is happening?

39:18.089 --> 39:19.579
I don't know.

39:20.691 --> 39:23.717
But it's pretty amazing.

39:27.465 --> 39:31.299
It almost makes me wish
it was happening to me.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.270
That's funny.

39:40.311 --> 39:44.873
All these years,
I was always the one jealous of you.

39:44.982 --> 39:46.847
Jealous of you and Dad.

39:47.318 --> 39:49.411
You were always his favorite, Eli.

39:49.487 --> 39:54.015
Yeah... you got to say goodbye.

40:04.502 --> 40:07.471
- Another round?
- Sure.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.835
Dad?

40:47.711 --> 40:49.838
We're gonna be OK.

40:51.849 --> 40:54.818
Nate, Mom... me.

40:54.919 --> 40:57.820
We all turn out OK.

41:00.424 --> 41:02.858
We are OK.

41:07.731 --> 41:09.096
Dad?

41:09.166 --> 41:13.330
Hey... Hey...

41:13.404 --> 41:17.670
It's Nate. I'm here.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.447
I'm sorry...

41:26.917 --> 41:28.282
You don't have to be sorry.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.450
You didn't do anything.

41:33.858 --> 41:36.622
I'm sorry, Eli.

41:42.733 --> 41:45.463
No, I'm sorry. Because...

41:46.837 --> 41:48.805
...I know that you tried to tell me

41:48.873 --> 41:52.309
about what was happening with you.

41:53.611 --> 41:56.375
And I know it seemed
like I wasn't listening.

41:57.882 --> 41:59.440
But I heard you, Dad.

42:04.288 --> 42:06.449
I heard you.

42:11.896 --> 42:14.023
Dad...
