WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:04.261
Previously, on "11.22.63"...

00:04.262 --> 00:05.328
Lee's back,

00:05.329 --> 00:07.378
which means we have to get
his place bugged tonight.

00:07.379 --> 00:09.974
We need to find out when
Oswald starts talking

00:09.975 --> 00:12.954
about General Walker and who he
starts talking about him to.

00:12.955 --> 00:14.550
That's George de Mohrenschildt.

00:14.551 --> 00:16.699
This might be the start
of the whole thing.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.718
- Who are you?
- Uh, I live downstairs.

00:19.719 --> 00:20.808
We're neighbors.

00:20.809 --> 00:22.888
Have you ever read any Karl Marx?

00:23.579 --> 00:25.799
So all we got to do is see
if Lee was really alone.

00:33.319 --> 00:34.897
Sorry to bother you.

00:36.729 --> 00:37.838
Bill,

00:37.839 --> 00:39.788
what happened at Walker's house?

00:39.789 --> 00:42.113
Was Lee there? Did... what'd you see?

00:42.114 --> 00:43.133
I screwed up, Jake.

00:43.134 --> 00:44.153
I'm sorry.

00:44.154 --> 00:45.624
I missed everything.

00:46.184 --> 00:47.572
Johnny Clayton.

00:48.094 --> 00:51.133
Sadie is my wife.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.183
He's not gonna give me the divorce.

00:53.184 --> 00:54.253
Why are you so upset?

00:57.194 --> 00:59.083
I would like to, you know,

00:59.084 --> 01:00.133
continue our little chat.

01:00.134 --> 01:02.253
Jake, don't come!

01:02.254 --> 01:04.183
Jesus.

01:04.184 --> 01:06.133
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.874
You saved my life.

01:16.204 --> 01:18.163
I have to tell you something.

01:18.164 --> 01:19.647
I'm from the future.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:50.114 --> 01:52.303
What qualifies you for this position?

01:52.304 --> 01:54.303
Sir, I work hard.

01:54.304 --> 01:58.458
I come to work ready to get
it done, whatever it is.

01:59.804 --> 02:01.232
What efforts have you made in the past

02:01.233 --> 02:04.095
to exceed the expectations
of your superiors?

02:06.501 --> 02:07.549
Well, I think it is important

02:07.550 --> 02:09.539
to have respect for your employers

02:09.541 --> 02:12.195
and for them to have respect for you,

02:13.442 --> 02:18.402
and I do my best to improve
every job situation, sir.

02:27.482 --> 02:29.370
Bonnie Lee?

02:29.371 --> 02:30.471
That's Bonnie Ray, sir.

02:30.472 --> 02:31.481
Not Bonnie Lee.

02:31.482 --> 02:32.775
That's what I said.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.421
Take Mr. Oswald here over to payroll.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.784
He starts this week.

02:53.402 --> 02:55.452
Welcome back, Lee.

02:57.532 --> 02:59.471
I have never been here before.

02:59.472 --> 03:00.531
I mean back to Dallas.

03:00.532 --> 03:02.391
You were away.

03:02.392 --> 03:03.541
How do you know?

03:03.542 --> 03:07.102
What was your favorite place,
New Orleans or Mexico?

03:09.512 --> 03:11.016
FBI.

03:12.502 --> 03:14.491
You're the agent that's
bothering my wife.

03:14.492 --> 03:15.852
Agent Hosty.

03:17.562 --> 03:21.043
I only talked to her
because you were gone.

03:24.462 --> 03:26.006
You make me sick.

03:27.432 --> 03:28.841
Say "Hi" to Marina.

03:29.502 --> 03:31.865
You have her new address, right?

03:44.482 --> 03:45.497
Hi, Lee.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.251
She here?

03:47.452 --> 03:49.480
Of course. They're out back.

03:49.481 --> 03:51.331
You know, I shouldn't
have to ask permission

03:51.332 --> 03:52.381
to see my own wife.

03:52.382 --> 03:54.032
It's not like that, Lee.

03:54.033 --> 03:56.001
It was her decision to leave.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.052
I'm just being a friend.

03:58.053 --> 04:00.082
I got an early birthday present.

04:00.542 --> 04:02.203
Who gives you presents?

04:03.317 --> 04:04.453
You're jealous.

04:04.454 --> 04:06.022
Fine, don't tell me.

04:06.023 --> 04:07.539
I got a job.

04:08.054 --> 04:09.373
That's the present.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.132
I do not understand.

04:11.133 --> 04:14.992
They know your birthday is
soon, so they give you a job?

04:14.993 --> 04:17.382
No, no, I was... I was making a joke.

04:18.618 --> 04:20.450
- Christ.
- But you got a job?

04:20.451 --> 04:21.521
Yes.

04:21.522 --> 04:23.421
The pay's okay.

04:23.422 --> 04:25.341
Texas School Book Depository.

04:25.342 --> 04:27.077
You love to read.

04:27.078 --> 04:29.050
It's... it's, uh, moving books.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.396
Not reading them.

04:32.122 --> 04:33.869
I want you to come home.

04:37.121 --> 04:39.518
You shouldn't be taking charity.

04:41.092 --> 04:43.051
You shouldn't be staying here.

04:43.052 --> 04:45.011
You should be home with me.

04:45.012 --> 04:46.317
Ruth is kind.

04:47.092 --> 04:49.101
I need people who are kind.

04:49.102 --> 04:49.802
Hmm.

04:51.498 --> 04:53.838
Please come home.

04:55.112 --> 04:57.062
Do you love me?

05:00.022 --> 05:01.331
We're married.

05:03.022 --> 05:04.065
Yes.

05:05.042 --> 05:07.080
I love Junie, I love you,

05:07.081 --> 05:09.238
and I love whoever this is.

05:11.659 --> 05:13.279
I don't know.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.559
You don't have to know anything.

05:16.042 --> 05:18.051
You just have to come back
home, Marina, Christ.

05:18.052 --> 05:19.101
- It's simple.
- I have to lie down.

05:19.102 --> 05:20.759
- Marina...
- My head aches.

05:22.192 --> 05:24.132
I think about it.

05:26.797 --> 05:27.897
Stay right there.

05:34.162 --> 05:35.401
Hi.

05:37.582 --> 05:39.211
Give her time, Lee.

05:39.644 --> 05:41.380
She'll come around.

06:44.590 --> 06:49.590
<font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix

06:51.202 --> 06:52.846
Hey, Bill.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.165
Bill.

07:16.961 --> 07:18.221
Hey, wake up.

07:18.785 --> 07:19.843
Big day.

07:21.082 --> 07:24.231
Lee got his job at the Texas
School Book Depository.

07:24.817 --> 07:26.150
It'd be great to see you around here

07:26.151 --> 07:28.020
more than once a week.

07:28.021 --> 07:29.819
I'm going crazy.

07:29.820 --> 07:32.402
Well, I've been taking care
of Sadie. You know that.

07:32.403 --> 07:35.413
I don't know why you can't
let me place some bets.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.293
Pass the time.

07:37.294 --> 07:40.453
Because we have to be careful,
and we can only make small bets.

07:40.454 --> 07:42.383
We don't want to draw
attention to ourselves.

07:47.424 --> 07:48.399
Hey.

07:51.424 --> 07:52.532
Hey, Bill.

07:54.334 --> 07:55.452
It's George.

07:55.453 --> 07:57.179
He's back.

07:58.483 --> 08:00.867
Hey, come on. Come on, come on, come on.

08:04.374 --> 08:06.293
- Come on!
- Yes, Haiti.

08:06.294 --> 08:07.473
Some oil leases.

08:07.474 --> 08:11.303
The travel was tedious but necessary.

08:11.304 --> 08:12.463
I did a little travelling myself.

08:12.464 --> 08:15.333
Oh, yeah? How do you looking so calm?

08:15.334 --> 08:17.393
Calm?

08:17.394 --> 08:19.483
How did you miss Walker?

08:19.484 --> 08:22.104
I thought you were a true marksman.

08:23.434 --> 08:25.493
What are you talking about?

08:25.494 --> 08:29.702
Lee, didn't you go fascist hunting?

08:30.374 --> 08:32.462
I wouldn't waste my time with Walker.

08:32.464 --> 08:33.692
Oh, no?

08:34.354 --> 08:36.703
It made the news. General shot.

08:37.404 --> 08:39.071
That wasn't you?

08:39.384 --> 08:41.634
Well, that's a funny thing to say.

08:42.394 --> 08:44.934
Well, let's go for a drive,
fascist hunter.

08:44.935 --> 08:46.342
No, no, no, no. Just stay. Stay.

08:46.343 --> 08:48.403
I'll take you to my house.

08:48.404 --> 08:50.483
You can say hello to Jeanne,
and we'll have a drink.

08:50.484 --> 08:52.237
Yeah, okay.

08:54.394 --> 08:55.580
Shit.

08:58.314 --> 08:59.475
What the hell was that?

09:00.354 --> 09:01.493
Was Lee playing dumb?

09:01.834 --> 09:03.413
George sounded like he was kidding.

09:04.076 --> 09:05.229
Why would he do that?

09:05.230 --> 09:06.973
Why would he come over,
say that, and leave?

09:06.974 --> 09:09.912
He's careful... and he knows.

09:09.913 --> 09:11.546
I mean, he's the one
who put Lee up to it.

09:11.547 --> 09:13.110
I've been thinking.

09:14.195 --> 09:16.304
Maybe Lee shooting the President,

09:16.305 --> 09:19.244
- maybe that's not gonna happen anymore.
- What?

09:19.245 --> 09:22.174
We never hear him making any plans.

09:22.175 --> 09:25.184
Didn't you say that thing
about butterfly wings?

09:25.185 --> 09:26.354
- The butterfly effect.
- May... yeah.

09:26.355 --> 09:29.234
Maybe, somehow, just
living underneath him,

09:29.235 --> 09:30.941
we've already changed the future.

09:32.235 --> 09:35.204
No, Bill, because we
didn't interact with him.

09:35.205 --> 09:36.958
So nothing's changed.

09:36.959 --> 09:40.044
If we don't alter his
life, then we're fine.

09:40.045 --> 09:41.729
If you're positive that it's him,

09:41.730 --> 09:43.868
then why don't you just off him today?

09:44.653 --> 09:46.344
Because I'm not positive,

09:46.345 --> 09:49.284
and if I kill Lee and
George is involved,

09:49.285 --> 09:52.354
then he'll have time to
recruit another assassin,

09:52.355 --> 09:55.642
and we... we still don't know
if there's a second shooter or not.

09:55.643 --> 09:57.364
- This again?
- This again.

09:57.365 --> 09:59.011
This is a thing.

09:59.885 --> 10:02.150
I'm not gonna kill him in cold blood.

10:03.736 --> 10:05.293
I've already killed two people.

10:05.294 --> 10:06.576
Who deserved it.

10:06.577 --> 10:08.538
And it feels like shit.

10:11.822 --> 10:13.022
You know what?

10:14.968 --> 10:17.662
We don't tack this whole thing
down by the end of the month,

10:17.925 --> 10:19.014
then we'll just kidnap him.

10:20.305 --> 10:21.675
Kidnap him?

10:22.255 --> 10:24.244
- Then what?
- I don't know.

10:24.245 --> 10:27.273
We just keep him incapacitated
on November 22nd.

10:28.830 --> 10:30.571
We could lock him in a car trunk,

10:31.724 --> 10:33.284
or give him sleeping pills.

10:34.335 --> 10:36.048
Sleeping pills.

10:36.285 --> 10:37.832
You're the boss.

10:40.215 --> 10:41.481
Yeah.

10:48.385 --> 10:51.785
And the final card is the 9 of clubs.

10:51.786 --> 10:55.605
So I'm gonna raise you 50.

10:56.175 --> 10:58.264
So what are you gonna do, Sadie?

10:58.265 --> 11:00.344
You can either fold, or you can raise,

11:00.345 --> 11:01.889
or you can call.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.374
Um, call?

11:05.375 --> 11:08.214
Okay, then put $0.50 in.

11:08.215 --> 11:09.364
Match me.

11:09.365 --> 11:11.365
Then we lay 'em down.

11:14.175 --> 11:15.942
Oh! Trip 9s?

11:15.943 --> 11:17.274
I'll be damned.

11:17.275 --> 11:19.244
I had you at two pair.

11:19.614 --> 11:20.992
Look at this,

11:21.225 --> 11:23.767
I'm shoving all my money at her
and she's not even gloating.

11:23.768 --> 11:25.067
Not natural.

11:25.365 --> 11:28.334
I'm sorry, Deke, I guess I'm
not very good company today.

11:28.335 --> 11:30.234
You should come back to school.

11:30.235 --> 11:31.947
It'll cure those blues.

11:31.948 --> 11:32.897
And Jake,

11:32.898 --> 11:35.742
when're you gonna make an honest
woman of this girl, for Chrissakes?

11:35.743 --> 11:39.253
- Marry her!
- Deke, leave him alone.

11:39.254 --> 11:41.274
Jake, you're an idiot.

11:41.275 --> 11:44.294
Well, it's past lunchtime.

11:44.295 --> 11:46.214
Better get back to school
or there's gonna be hell

11:46.215 --> 11:47.364
to pay with Miz Mimi.

11:47.365 --> 11:48.721
Sadie.

11:50.325 --> 11:52.851
Oh, come on by later, Jake.

11:52.852 --> 11:54.152
She wants to talk to you.

11:54.918 --> 11:55.852
All right.

11:57.375 --> 11:58.559
Hi.

12:04.305 --> 12:05.539
Hospital called.

12:06.175 --> 12:07.364
Plastic surgeon's in residence.

12:07.365 --> 12:10.547
They want to move up my last
facial surgery to tomorrow.

12:11.265 --> 12:12.783
Sure you don't want to wait?

12:13.596 --> 12:15.277
I need to be done with hospitals.

12:16.295 --> 12:19.324
What I'm not sure about is
how much it's costing you.

12:19.325 --> 12:21.364
I told you not to worry about that.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.374
But it's $8,000.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.068
How do you just get $8,000?

12:27.225 --> 12:28.188
I'll be careful.

12:29.195 --> 12:30.334
It's a calculated risk.

12:30.335 --> 12:32.374
Then we'll have all the
money for the surgery.

12:32.375 --> 12:33.730
End of story.

12:34.345 --> 12:36.405
As if there is such a thing.

12:39.365 --> 12:41.591
Tell me one more thing about the future.

12:42.814 --> 12:45.233
Sadie, you said you weren't
gonna ask about that anymore.

12:45.234 --> 12:48.214
Oh, come on, please? One thing.

12:48.215 --> 12:50.404
Do pantyhose ever get comfortable?

12:50.405 --> 12:51.702
I don't know.

12:52.084 --> 12:53.798
My guess is it gets worse.

12:54.038 --> 12:55.226
Hmm.

12:56.285 --> 12:58.324
And when's the shooting
supposed to happen?

12:59.758 --> 13:00.905
In a month.

13:01.395 --> 13:03.560
But I'm not gonna wait that long.

13:04.235 --> 13:06.803
Well, can't you just call
the police? Anonymously?

13:09.245 --> 13:11.713
The Dallas police blew
everyone away by how badly

13:11.714 --> 13:15.695
they screwed everything up,
so I can't trust them.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.714
Sadie, I want to tell you everything.

13:19.715 --> 13:20.995
It's just not safe.

13:22.446 --> 13:23.266
I know.

13:25.366 --> 13:26.623
I'm just scared about tomorrow.

13:31.456 --> 13:32.578
I know.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.590
It's gonna be okay.

13:39.556 --> 13:42.868
Miss Dunhill is sorely
missed at the school.

13:43.526 --> 13:46.027
Please tell her we are
all thinking of her.

13:46.028 --> 13:47.749
She misses being here.

13:49.175 --> 13:51.293
She's been having bad dreams.

13:51.294 --> 13:52.867
Understandable.

13:54.254 --> 13:55.665
You know,

13:56.304 --> 13:59.639
Deke thinks that I should
ask her to marry me.

14:00.164 --> 14:02.809
He has expressed that opinion to me.

14:05.043 --> 14:07.252
Yeah, I just can't.

14:07.253 --> 14:08.970
I don't want to hurt her.

14:12.497 --> 14:14.370
I have cancer.

14:15.344 --> 14:16.752
What?

14:17.264 --> 14:19.754
I'm told the tumor's
the size of a lemon.

14:19.755 --> 14:21.603
I don't have much time.

14:24.174 --> 14:25.731
Is there anything you can do?

14:26.244 --> 14:30.363
Mr. Simmons, Deke,

14:30.747 --> 14:33.674
he heard there are experimental
treatments in Mexico.

14:34.765 --> 14:36.765
He wants to take me there.

14:38.544 --> 14:42.252
Well, maybe you two should go.

14:42.253 --> 14:43.429
Together.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.293
That's just borrowing trouble.

14:46.294 --> 14:48.705
In any case, Jodie is my home.

14:49.648 --> 14:53.397
"We shall not all sleep, but
we shall all be changed."

14:54.184 --> 14:56.192
Corinthians 15:51.

14:58.687 --> 15:01.957
Mr. Amberson, you're not crying, I hope.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.264
I wish you'd call me Jake.

15:11.294 --> 15:13.234
I wish you'd told me sooner.

15:16.184 --> 15:19.351
There are two things you can
do for me after I pass.

15:20.254 --> 15:23.342
First, I hope you'll
be a friend to Deke.

15:24.234 --> 15:26.650
I hate to think of him all alone.

15:27.684 --> 15:28.620
Of course.

15:29.736 --> 15:30.736
Thank you.

15:33.264 --> 15:35.392
What's... what's the second thing?

15:36.294 --> 15:40.190
You believe me when I tell you
I love Deke and he loves me?

15:41.274 --> 15:42.740
Yes, ma'am.

15:44.154 --> 15:47.213
Deke and I have spent our
lives next to one another.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.982
Not with one another.

15:52.164 --> 15:53.869
You love Miss Dunhill.

15:55.164 --> 15:56.149
Yes, ma'am.

15:57.274 --> 16:00.354
Don't wait. Don't wait.

16:08.234 --> 16:09.735
Uh, boxing match.

16:10.194 --> 16:11.484
Rodriguez-McClure.

16:12.284 --> 16:15.790
And you want bigger action,
like, couple hundred?

16:16.294 --> 16:17.438
More.

16:17.939 --> 16:20.138
Sam, you're gonna want
to handle this one.

16:25.727 --> 16:28.222
Hi. I'm Jake Amberson.

16:29.214 --> 16:31.500
Charlene says you're on the up and up.

16:33.264 --> 16:35.283
What do you do, Jake Amberson?

16:35.284 --> 16:36.735
English teacher.

16:39.020 --> 16:41.202
Watching kids crap on the
language day in, day out?

16:41.203 --> 16:42.373
I'd shoot myself.

16:42.374 --> 16:43.726
Oh, yeah.

16:44.264 --> 16:48.213
Um, so what kind of odds
can I get on Rodriguez

16:48.214 --> 16:49.735
going all ten rounds?

16:51.144 --> 16:54.263
McClure's a college man,
feels more your type.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.407
Nah.

16:57.294 --> 16:59.223
Well, Rodriguez is a pogo stick.

16:59.224 --> 17:03.864
I guess I could do four to one.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.528
Yeah. I'm in for 800.

17:18.243 --> 17:19.679
Good luck, son.

17:22.243 --> 17:25.153
You win this, you're
taking me out for a drink.

17:25.154 --> 17:26.213
Okay, Charlene.

17:26.214 --> 17:28.233
Put some champagne on ice.

17:34.364 --> 17:35.766
Bill?

17:57.144 --> 18:00.363
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday, brother.

18:00.364 --> 18:03.546
For he's a jolly good fellow.

18:04.234 --> 18:07.286
For he's a jolly good fellow.

18:07.953 --> 18:11.116
For he's a jolly good fellow,

18:11.656 --> 18:15.048
which nobody can deny.

18:15.609 --> 18:17.658
Bill, thank you for coming.

18:17.659 --> 18:19.623
Of course I'd come, Marina.

18:20.294 --> 18:22.213
I'd always come if you called.

18:22.214 --> 18:24.203
Happy birthday, Lee!

18:24.204 --> 18:26.364
Happy birthday, Lee!

18:45.274 --> 18:49.233
Hi, uh, I live downstairs.

18:50.144 --> 18:52.163
Is my brother here?

18:52.164 --> 18:53.343
Do you have cigarettes?

18:53.344 --> 18:55.095
No, sorry.

18:55.778 --> 18:57.243
Come in.

18:57.244 --> 19:00.021
Okay.

19:05.469 --> 19:07.152
You look lost.

19:07.153 --> 19:09.343
I'm looking for my brother.

19:09.723 --> 19:11.223
Would that be Bill?

19:11.224 --> 19:12.421
You know Bill?

19:12.796 --> 19:14.500
Everybody knows Bill.

19:16.293 --> 19:18.333
- No, no.
- Okay, try it again.

19:18.334 --> 19:20.163
Try it again.

19:20.164 --> 19:22.303
Na zdorovie.

19:22.304 --> 19:23.930
Na-sa-di-rovie.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.975
Na zdorovie!

19:30.254 --> 19:31.963
Look what Junie made me.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.373
Oh, isn't that darling? Look at that.

19:33.374 --> 19:35.344
I'm the king.

19:38.184 --> 19:39.313
Who is that?

19:39.314 --> 19:41.223
You don't even know your own neighbors.

19:41.224 --> 19:42.718
That is typical.

19:43.678 --> 19:45.173
Come on, Ma.

19:45.174 --> 19:46.303
Dance with the king.

19:46.304 --> 19:48.317
I'd be delighted.

19:52.334 --> 19:56.143
Bill, Bill! Come on.

19:56.144 --> 19:57.750
How often have you been coming here?

19:57.751 --> 20:00.142
Jesus. Have a drink.

20:00.143 --> 20:01.353
It's a party.

20:01.354 --> 20:04.957
Do you... you realize how badly

20:04.958 --> 20:06.302
you're messing things up right now?

20:06.303 --> 20:08.682
How do you know I'm not
making them better?

20:08.683 --> 20:10.323
You don't.

20:10.324 --> 20:12.203
I've come up here a couple of times.

20:12.204 --> 20:13.839
Talked books with Lee.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.313
Had a beer.

20:15.314 --> 20:19.183
I wanted to know if he ever
said anything about Kennedy,

20:19.184 --> 20:20.273
and guess what.

20:20.274 --> 20:21.744
He hasn't.

20:22.234 --> 20:25.173
You mess with the past, it messes back.

20:25.174 --> 20:26.343
Ah! Oh!

20:26.344 --> 20:29.223
Are you all right?

20:29.224 --> 20:30.919
Let's get you to the kitchen.

20:32.334 --> 20:36.273
- It's not... not... not time yet.
- You sure?

20:36.274 --> 20:40.303
Maybe, maybe you should take
your wife to the hospital.

20:40.304 --> 20:42.173
Bobby, you heard her.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.373
Women know.

20:43.822 --> 20:45.515
She's not having it yet.

20:46.254 --> 20:49.739
Where is the man of the hour?

20:49.740 --> 20:52.834
Happy birthday, Comrade.

20:53.344 --> 20:58.203
And the lovely girl from Minsk,
how are you feeling?

20:58.204 --> 21:00.303
Sir, I think we need to
get you another bourbon.

21:00.304 --> 21:02.283
- Am I right?
- No. We're leaving.

21:02.284 --> 21:03.283
No, you go.

21:03.284 --> 21:05.333
We are leaving now.

21:05.334 --> 21:09.225
Don't be such an asshole.

21:10.174 --> 21:12.243
I made that real clear in case
you want to listen to it later.

21:12.244 --> 21:15.173
All right. Now come on.

21:15.174 --> 21:17.283
Oops.

21:17.284 --> 21:20.183
Lee, I just broke your lamp.

21:20.184 --> 21:21.303
- I'm sorry.
- I'll help you.

21:21.304 --> 21:23.223
That's fine, that's fine. Just...

21:23.224 --> 21:25.154
No, I knocked it with my arm.

21:34.174 --> 21:35.333
What is this?

21:35.334 --> 21:37.648
- What is what?
- This.

21:37.972 --> 21:39.417
What is this?

21:39.836 --> 21:41.020
- I don't...
- Do you know?

21:41.889 --> 21:43.825
Do you know? Because I do.

21:44.234 --> 21:45.657
This is a bug.

21:46.194 --> 21:48.233
It's a fucking bug. It's surveillance.

21:48.234 --> 21:50.173
- Come on, let me see that.
- Look, Bobby, look.

21:50.174 --> 21:51.273
Lee, what in the world?

21:51.274 --> 21:52.363
Mother, what did I tell you?

21:52.364 --> 21:55.233
- The FBI have been following me.
- Oh...

21:55.234 --> 21:56.303
No, they... they follow me.

21:56.304 --> 21:58.263
They listen in on what I say.

21:58.264 --> 22:00.183
They harass me. They harass my wife.

22:00.184 --> 22:01.841
No one is harassing anyone.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.203
Who would bug you?

22:04.224 --> 22:05.303
The fucking Feds!

22:05.304 --> 22:07.436
Lee, you have to stop talking now.

22:12.324 --> 22:14.174
Hey, Lee! Lee! Lee!

22:16.284 --> 22:18.303
Land of the free?

22:18.304 --> 22:20.143
Home of the brave?

22:20.144 --> 22:22.343
This is such a crock of shit.

22:22.344 --> 22:25.314
Lee, this is very dramatic.

22:27.824 --> 22:29.410
Hey, come back. Lee.

22:29.411 --> 22:32.551
- Don't leave, Lee.
- No, Marina, get off me!

22:32.752 --> 22:35.751
Lee! Lee.

22:36.447 --> 22:40.577
Bill, we need to go.

22:40.578 --> 22:42.488
I'm gonna stay.

22:42.489 --> 22:44.216
Help clean up.

22:56.419 --> 22:57.642
Fuck!

23:00.439 --> 23:02.191
Fucking idiot.

23:35.589 --> 23:37.569
Fuck were you thinking?

23:43.986 --> 23:46.035
Shut up! You shut up!

23:46.036 --> 23:47.935
You shut up! Shut up, huh?

23:47.936 --> 23:50.775
Shut up. I love her, and she loves me.

23:50.776 --> 23:53.346
- You are so fucking dumb.
- Yeah?

23:53.347 --> 23:54.485
If I'm so fucking dumb,

23:54.486 --> 23:56.475
how come you never noticed
I was seeing her?

23:56.476 --> 23:58.033
Hmm?

23:58.316 --> 24:00.475
And you know what else? Lee likes me.

24:00.476 --> 24:03.455
I'm his best friend. Now how dumb am I?

24:03.456 --> 24:05.505
Lee doesn't boss me around all the time.

24:05.506 --> 24:07.405
What is she gonna say when she finds out

24:07.406 --> 24:09.285
you've been surveilling
her for two years?

24:09.286 --> 24:10.455
Don't act like you care about her.

24:10.456 --> 24:13.385
You listen to Lee beat
on her all day long.

24:13.386 --> 24:16.455
Bill, she is not who we're here to save.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.365
I'm not trying to save anyone.

24:18.366 --> 24:19.423
That's over.

24:20.386 --> 24:22.505
Now, if you get in
between me and Marina,

24:22.506 --> 24:25.540
I will tell Lee everything
you've been doing.

24:26.296 --> 24:28.405
He saw the bug. He knows.

24:28.406 --> 24:30.495
I'll show him exactly
how we wired the place.

24:30.496 --> 24:31.772
Ow!

24:34.306 --> 24:35.325
Do you hear me?

24:35.326 --> 24:37.496
You are fucking out of control.

24:41.506 --> 24:44.738
I did everything you told me to, always.

24:45.496 --> 24:47.777
I'm not scared of you anymore.

24:49.326 --> 24:52.405
If you ever try and tell
me to do anything again,

24:52.406 --> 24:54.505
for the rest of your
life, I will kill you.

24:54.506 --> 24:56.475
- Yeah.
- You don't mean that.

24:56.476 --> 24:58.921
You go live with your
scarface girlfriend.

24:59.126 --> 25:01.225
The one it's okay for you to have.

25:01.226 --> 25:03.738
Go. Go!

25:04.356 --> 25:06.405
This is my place now.

25:06.406 --> 25:08.033
Don't come back.

25:08.794 --> 25:13.416
Fuck you, fuck your
mission, and fuck JFK!

25:23.486 --> 25:25.516
$1.50 to shoot.

25:33.496 --> 25:36.435
I could rake the field for shells.

25:36.436 --> 25:38.406
Work off the difference.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.349
Do you think Bill would
ever try to hurt you?

26:20.396 --> 26:21.604
I don't know.

26:21.605 --> 26:24.434
I'd say no, except he
had a gun in my face.

26:24.435 --> 26:26.385
Well, call the police.
Have him arrested.

26:26.386 --> 26:28.445
Sadie, I can't call the police.

26:28.446 --> 26:30.485
That would just make things worse.

26:30.486 --> 26:33.415
Does this affect what's gonna
happen to the President?

26:33.416 --> 26:37.405
I don't think so. I mean... no, no, no.

26:37.406 --> 26:38.495
Sadie, I'm...

26:38.788 --> 26:41.355
I'm sorry. Let's not talk
about this right now.

26:41.356 --> 26:44.834
Let's just take care of you, okay?

26:45.346 --> 26:47.325
As soon as you're in the recovery room,

26:47.326 --> 26:49.295
I'm going back to talk to Bill myself.

26:51.466 --> 26:53.435
Time to go to Parkland.

26:53.436 --> 26:55.475
I hear there are some doctors
there that want to have a look

26:55.476 --> 26:58.416
at what real beauty looks like.

27:05.346 --> 27:07.364
I don't feel sorry for myself.

27:07.365 --> 27:08.126
I know.

27:09.446 --> 27:11.946
I just don't want to look
at myself and see him.

27:12.426 --> 27:14.060
That part of my life's over.

27:15.436 --> 27:17.168
You know what Deke calls you?

27:17.924 --> 27:18.962
What?

27:19.850 --> 27:21.486
A new kind of woman.

27:23.456 --> 27:25.049
I can live with that.

27:26.486 --> 27:29.486
Tell me one more thing about the future.

27:31.726 --> 27:35.434
People walk around with their phones

27:35.435 --> 27:37.661
in their hands all day.

27:38.376 --> 27:40.101
Something real.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.316
I love you.

27:42.969 --> 27:44.944
Now, and in the future.

27:46.506 --> 27:47.991
I love you.

27:58.466 --> 28:00.445
Told Miz Mimi we'd visit later today,

28:00.446 --> 28:02.355
after we see how Sadie's doing.

28:02.356 --> 28:03.745
Yeah, of course.

28:04.456 --> 28:07.898
Mimi sure has seen too many
of these places lately.

28:08.129 --> 28:10.229
I'm sorry.

28:28.376 --> 28:31.346
Hey! Hey!

28:39.306 --> 28:42.315
Hey! Hey!

28:42.316 --> 28:43.505
Looks like we're locked in here.

28:43.506 --> 28:46.369
I think something's wrong.
I got to get to Sadie.

28:46.370 --> 28:48.446
Hey!

29:17.516 --> 29:19.091
Let's begin.

29:20.416 --> 29:23.786
Miss Dunhill, I'm gonna try to make
you as comfortable as possible.

29:24.356 --> 29:25.415
Levels good?

29:25.416 --> 29:26.619
Yes, they're right.

29:37.406 --> 29:39.315
Hey!

29:39.316 --> 29:40.415
What in God's name has
gotten into you, son?

29:40.416 --> 29:41.549
We got to get to Sadie, okay?

29:41.550 --> 29:43.445
I don't think she should do the surgery.

29:43.446 --> 29:46.416
Well, somebody will come...
What are you doing?

29:48.426 --> 29:51.516
- Just give it a minute.
- I don't have a minute.

29:54.376 --> 29:57.425
When you wake up,
everything will be fine.

29:57.426 --> 29:59.515
I'm gonna count backwards from ten.

29:59.516 --> 30:01.365
Why backwards?

30:01.366 --> 30:03.127
That's just what we do.

30:05.336 --> 30:06.345
Ten...

30:06.346 --> 30:07.445
What the hell?

30:07.446 --> 30:08.455
Jake!

30:08.456 --> 30:09.840
Nine...

30:09.841 --> 30:11.405
What's wrong with you?

30:11.406 --> 30:12.505
Just calm down!

30:12.506 --> 30:14.455
Eight...

30:20.466 --> 30:22.169
Seven...

30:24.356 --> 30:25.676
Six...

30:26.366 --> 30:28.415
- Stop! Stop now.
- You can't be in here.

30:28.416 --> 30:30.305
- Stop!
- Please.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.385
- Jake?
- What's the matter with you?

30:32.386 --> 30:34.395
Look, we... we have
to stop this surgery.

30:34.396 --> 30:36.435
- What's going on?
- Please.

30:36.436 --> 30:37.558
Please.

30:37.559 --> 30:39.665
Dr. Gelberg, we have a
technical issue here.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.884
She wasn't getting any oxygen.

30:43.496 --> 30:45.366
Sadie.

30:58.156 --> 30:59.249
It's settled.

31:00.416 --> 31:02.813
I'll be a woman with character.

31:04.386 --> 31:06.143
You're perfect.

31:08.165 --> 31:10.354
Jake, I want to ask you something.

31:10.919 --> 31:12.340
Will you be honest with me?

31:12.341 --> 31:13.858
Of course.

31:15.516 --> 31:17.741
Am I in the way of what you're doing?

31:18.476 --> 31:19.699
Your mission?

31:22.466 --> 31:24.496
You're not gonna get
rid of me that easy.

31:30.486 --> 31:32.446
Sorry.

31:58.346 --> 31:59.415
Hey, look at that.

31:59.416 --> 32:01.812
- Huh.
- Wow.

32:06.486 --> 32:08.486
Hmm.

32:13.416 --> 32:14.670
You ever shoot?

32:15.396 --> 32:16.585
I'm from Kentucky.

32:17.216 --> 32:19.485
You find a man from
Kentucky who doesn't shoot,

32:19.818 --> 32:21.375
I'll give you a dollar.

32:21.376 --> 32:23.396
Ha. Right.

32:25.286 --> 32:29.435
Bam! Unh! Bam!

32:29.436 --> 32:30.515
Wham!

32:30.516 --> 32:32.425
Second shooter.

32:32.426 --> 32:35.305
- Not bad.
- Jesus Christ.

32:35.306 --> 32:36.561
Not bad at all.

32:39.035 --> 32:40.080
Bill?

32:40.496 --> 32:41.558
Bill.

32:42.936 --> 32:44.375
Hey.

32:44.376 --> 32:47.201
I told you to get the hell
away and never come back.

32:47.202 --> 32:48.302
I know.

32:48.303 --> 32:50.385
Look, I was just at the
hospital with Sadie.

32:50.386 --> 32:53.355
Marina was there. She's
having the baby right now.

32:53.356 --> 32:55.026
- What?
- And she's alone.

32:55.027 --> 32:56.756
All right? Lee's not there.

32:57.396 --> 32:59.112
Bill, she was asking for you.

32:59.113 --> 33:01.364
Marina is asking for you.

33:01.365 --> 33:04.036
Right now. Right now!

33:04.037 --> 33:05.555
Let's go!

33:10.296 --> 33:11.918
Excuse me.

33:11.919 --> 33:13.455
- Where are we supposed to go?
- Uh...

33:13.456 --> 33:14.738
Where is she?

33:15.436 --> 33:17.818
This way. This way. Come on.

33:22.446 --> 33:24.465
Where's the women having babies area?

33:24.466 --> 33:25.965
Is this your brother?

33:25.966 --> 33:27.445
Y-yes. Yes, sir.

33:27.446 --> 33:29.425
Hey, where's Marina?

33:29.426 --> 33:31.465
Bill, hello, I'm Dr. Moren.

33:31.466 --> 33:33.954
Would you like to come
with me, to sit and talk?

33:33.955 --> 33:36.344
What the hell? Where's Marina?

33:36.345 --> 33:38.345
Your brother is worried about you.

33:38.346 --> 33:40.475
Bill. Bill, I'm sorry.

33:40.476 --> 33:42.516
Look, this won't be long. I promise.

33:46.336 --> 33:47.593
Jake.

33:49.386 --> 33:52.295
Okay, yeah, I'll come with you.

33:52.296 --> 33:54.455
- Go!
- Get him!

33:54.456 --> 33:57.495
No!

33:57.496 --> 33:59.505
- Bill!
- How about this?

33:59.506 --> 34:03.345
You gotta be fucking kidding me!
I'll tell them everything!

34:03.346 --> 34:05.325
I didn't think it'd be like this.

34:05.326 --> 34:07.355
- You're doing the right thing.
- I'll tell them everything!

34:07.356 --> 34:09.445
You'll go to prison! You'll fucking rot!

34:09.446 --> 34:12.395
- Come on!
- I saw Jake Amberson kill a man

34:12.396 --> 34:13.844
with an electrical cord!

34:14.366 --> 34:17.344
He's been spying on our
neighbors for two years!

34:17.346 --> 34:19.284
And he's not even my fucking brother.

34:19.286 --> 34:22.304
He's not even my fucking brother.

34:22.306 --> 34:23.960
He's from the future, okay?

34:24.315 --> 34:26.295
He's not... oh, fuck!

34:26.295 --> 34:28.415
Fuck, you fuckers are so fucking dumb!

34:28.416 --> 34:30.385
I'm not the one. I'm not
the one who's trouble.

34:30.386 --> 34:32.425
Let us take it from here.
We'll take good care of him.

34:32.426 --> 34:33.893
It's him. He's the one.

34:33.895 --> 34:36.666
- He needs help.
- Clearly. Obviously.

34:36.667 --> 34:38.165
He's gonna kill a man.

34:39.619 --> 34:42.312
I'm not the one who's
trouble. He's the killer!

34:55.688 --> 34:58.587
Now, these forms will let
you officially commit Bill.

34:58.588 --> 35:01.644
We'll start a thorough
mental evaluation today.

35:02.678 --> 35:05.928
All right, I might be
back in three, four days.

35:05.929 --> 35:07.546
See if he's calmed down.

35:07.547 --> 35:08.647
Maybe this will be over fast.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.687
- We'll have to see.
- Okay.

35:10.688 --> 35:13.914
And he... he can't sign himself
out without me, right?

35:13.915 --> 35:15.204
Heavens, no.

35:15.205 --> 35:16.605
He's not competent.

35:17.260 --> 35:18.155
All right.

35:27.217 --> 35:28.435
Thank you.

35:38.073 --> 35:39.993
- No, go ahead.
- Thank you.

37:24.113 --> 37:25.992
- Ah!
- Put your hands down.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.172
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

37:27.173 --> 37:29.982
Put your hands down, God damn it!

37:29.983 --> 37:30.992
Be quiet.

37:30.993 --> 37:32.659
Put your fucking hands down!

37:33.093 --> 37:36.042
Now, if you look back here,

37:36.043 --> 37:39.152
if you make any noise,
I will strangle you,

37:39.153 --> 37:43.122
and then I will go to your
house and I will kill Jeanne.

37:43.123 --> 37:44.893
Do you understand?

37:46.532 --> 37:48.142
Now, tell me about your friendship

37:48.143 --> 37:50.625
with Lee Harvey Oswald.

37:51.993 --> 37:53.644
We aren't friends.

37:54.385 --> 37:56.012
I know him.

37:56.013 --> 37:58.887
A semi-educated hillbilly.

37:58.888 --> 38:01.316
Do you know who I work for?

38:02.193 --> 38:05.082
We spoke with you at El Conejo.

38:05.455 --> 38:07.052
We know about Haiti.

38:07.053 --> 38:09.072
We know Duvalier.

38:09.382 --> 38:13.042
Do you expect to keep your
oil leases if you lie?

38:13.043 --> 38:18.092
Now, tell me about Lee
Oswald and your plan.

38:18.093 --> 38:20.411
I don't know any plan.

38:23.123 --> 38:24.192
I don't know any plan.

38:24.193 --> 38:26.981
We know you told him to kill Walker.

38:26.982 --> 38:29.122
We know this. We heard this.

38:29.123 --> 38:31.012
But I told you.

38:31.013 --> 38:33.022
I was winding him up.

38:33.023 --> 38:35.052
Implying big things.

38:35.053 --> 38:36.982
I thought, "Who knows what happens?

38:36.983 --> 38:38.042
Who cares?"

38:38.043 --> 38:39.972
But after the shooting happened,

38:39.973 --> 38:41.142
he said nothing.

38:41.143 --> 38:46.460
I reported all this to my handler.

38:47.376 --> 38:48.625
Please.

38:48.626 --> 38:51.971
- Please! I told you.
- All right.

38:51.972 --> 38:56.192
So you recruit Oswald and then what?

38:56.193 --> 39:00.162
Lee is not a recruit. I...

39:00.163 --> 39:02.052
I told my handler.

39:02.053 --> 39:06.032
I said, "Walker could maybe happen."

39:06.033 --> 39:09.071
You all said, "Waste of time."

39:09.072 --> 39:11.102
I don't understand.

39:11.103 --> 39:13.982
I report everything.

39:13.983 --> 39:16.082
And what was in the envelope?

39:16.083 --> 39:19.092
- What was in the envelope?
- What envelope?

39:19.093 --> 39:21.972
The fucking envelope
that you gave him today.

39:21.973 --> 39:23.162
What was it for?

39:23.451 --> 39:26.449
For watering my grass.

39:28.153 --> 39:31.002
Lee waters your fucking lawn?

39:31.003 --> 39:32.519
Don't fucking lie to me.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.368
Why would you give him money?

39:34.369 --> 39:35.379
- Not for...
- Why?

39:35.380 --> 39:36.837
Not for him.

39:37.460 --> 39:40.249
I want to help Marina.

39:40.250 --> 39:42.399
She's from Minsk, like me.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.490
She has nobody.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.329
I can't give it to her directly.

39:47.330 --> 39:50.616
It hurts his pride and he beats her.

39:51.280 --> 39:54.826
Who else is involved in
the plan to kill Kennedy?

39:58.420 --> 40:01.796
What? I don't know!

40:01.797 --> 40:03.329
Why should I believe you?

40:03.330 --> 40:04.469
Tell me.

40:04.470 --> 40:08.590
Jackie calls me Uncle George,

40:08.591 --> 40:12.388
and Kennedy is taking on
those communist shits

40:12.389 --> 40:14.339
who took over my country!

40:14.340 --> 40:16.398
Why should I kill him?

40:18.948 --> 40:21.101
I don't know any plan.

40:21.350 --> 40:22.439
There's no plan.

40:22.440 --> 40:25.197
No Kennedy plan. No plan!

40:25.198 --> 40:26.349
If Lee was set up,

40:26.350 --> 40:28.678
then George was the only guy
who could have done it.

40:28.679 --> 40:31.439
You need to cross off that possibility.

40:31.440 --> 40:34.469
All right, and if I do that, then what?

40:34.470 --> 40:37.419
Then you kill Oswald.

40:37.420 --> 40:39.409
No.

40:40.098 --> 40:41.298
I mean, isn't there some way

40:41.299 --> 40:44.470
I can stop Oswald without
having to kill him?

40:47.370 --> 40:48.281
No.

40:49.930 --> 40:51.309
All right. Shut up.

40:51.310 --> 40:53.329
Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

40:53.330 --> 40:54.429
Now, listen.

40:54.430 --> 40:58.373
You will never talk to Lee Oswald again,

40:59.059 --> 41:02.369
and if you tell anyone about this,

41:02.370 --> 41:04.446
you will be killed.

41:13.350 --> 41:14.211
Hello?

41:14.750 --> 41:15.967
Hey, honey.

41:16.330 --> 41:18.399
Jake, are you all right?

41:18.400 --> 41:21.950
Yeah, it's all gonna be okay now.

41:22.430 --> 41:23.728
I know everything.

41:23.729 --> 41:25.972
The man I was... was following,

41:25.973 --> 41:28.599
I know now he... He's acting alone,

41:29.400 --> 41:33.764
and, you know, Bill... Bill's safe.

41:34.300 --> 41:35.744
He won't be a part of it.

41:37.250 --> 41:39.743
So all I need to do is...

41:42.360 --> 41:44.419
do what I came to do,
and then it'll be over.

41:44.420 --> 41:46.266
What you came to do?

41:47.400 --> 41:48.948
Are you gonna do it now?

41:50.340 --> 41:51.439
Yeah.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.045
And then you'll come home?

41:54.340 --> 41:55.560
Yes.

41:56.310 --> 41:57.563
Jake, hurry.

41:58.300 --> 41:59.343
Sadie.

42:00.270 --> 42:01.389
Sadie...

42:04.040 --> 42:05.459
will you marry me?

42:11.370 --> 42:14.944
You did not just ask me to
do that over the telephone.

42:16.250 --> 42:17.419
Deke's right, you're an idiot.

42:17.420 --> 42:18.686
I know.

42:19.400 --> 42:22.332
But just tell me you'll marry me,

42:23.910 --> 42:25.798
and that you'll never leave me,

42:28.290 --> 42:30.340
and that you'll come
to the future with me.

42:34.330 --> 42:36.462
Tell me one more thing about the future.

42:39.450 --> 42:41.410
In the future, we're married.

42:44.460 --> 42:46.402
I like the sound of that.

42:47.310 --> 42:48.718
Is that an answer?

42:48.962 --> 42:51.268
Come home, and I'll give you an answer.

42:52.390 --> 42:53.546
Okay.

43:02.380 --> 43:04.241
Charlene says, "Hi."

43:07.330 --> 43:09.329
- Hey! Go!
- Go around!

43:18.350 --> 43:20.240
Ah!

43:22.390 --> 43:24.360
Go ahead now. Get him.

43:27.250 --> 43:29.369
- Come on. Come on!
- Get up!

43:40.280 --> 43:41.647
How you like that, boy?

43:42.320 --> 43:43.611
Little more for you.

43:44.330 --> 43:47.369
Look, is this... Is
this about the money?

43:47.370 --> 43:49.339
The fact is, I-I have some.

43:49.340 --> 43:54.042
Oh, I know you do, 'cause
you took it from me.

43:54.787 --> 43:56.319
You thought you were being so clever,

43:56.320 --> 43:59.566
making all those bets all over Dallas.

44:00.410 --> 44:03.379
But you know those different places?

44:03.380 --> 44:07.820
They're owned by what you
might call my franchise.

44:08.340 --> 44:10.349
So suddenly, the Rodriguez-McClure fight

44:10.350 --> 44:13.157
cost me $15,000.

44:14.380 --> 44:16.551
I was ready to let your bets go,

44:17.420 --> 44:22.091
but the thing is, your
brother, Bill Amberson,

44:22.092 --> 44:23.448
made the same bet,

44:23.449 --> 44:26.329
and he did it in three different places.

44:26.330 --> 44:28.359
Now, that is just insulting.

44:28.360 --> 44:29.804
No, no, no, no.

44:29.805 --> 44:33.310
And for you and for you
brother to rook me?

44:35.717 --> 44:37.347
He needs a lesson.

44:38.330 --> 44:40.310
Again.

44:42.460 --> 44:44.329
I'm sorry.

44:44.330 --> 44:46.084
Look, I'll give it back.

44:46.682 --> 44:48.410
Oh, I know you will.

44:49.330 --> 44:52.545
It's just, you see, that I'm
professionally obligated

44:52.546 --> 44:54.477
to make an example of you.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.400
- Yeah, huh.
- Let's go.

45:55.330 --> 45:56.891
You're gonna be okay.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.440
I'm right here.

46:02.440 --> 46:03.799
I don't...

46:04.380 --> 46:07.183
I don't know... What?

46:07.801 --> 46:08.999
How?

46:10.370 --> 46:11.783
He's okay.

46:13.250 --> 46:14.369
Everything's gonna be okay.

46:14.370 --> 46:15.673
I love you.

46:19.046 --> 46:20.236
I love you.

46:22.069 --> 46:23.218
I love you.

46:23.420 --> 46:24.706
What?

46:27.360 --> 46:28.622
Christy?

46:48.320 --> 46:50.148
Doesn't even recognize me.

46:51.718 --> 46:53.419
Doesn't even know my name.

46:53.746 --> 46:55.566
He's had a traumatic head injury.

46:56.320 --> 46:58.164
You need to give him recovery time.

47:00.300 --> 47:02.603
But he's been like this so long.

47:04.290 --> 47:06.733
How long's it gonna take
for him to get better?

47:13.370 --> 47:14.721
Jake.

47:16.241 --> 47:21.241
