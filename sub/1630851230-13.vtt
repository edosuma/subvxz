00:12.621 --> 00:14.188

00:14.231 --> 00:16.451
But she said she noticed

00:16.494 --> 00:18.409

calling the SEC,

00:47.743 --> 00:51.442
and she's requested an audit
of her account.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.444

what that is.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.838

she sounded serious.

I swear on my daddy's grave,
that's how it happened.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.396
- Boss, I need a minute.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.923
- Cuff him and
put him in the car.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.708
- Wait, you're arresting me?

21:14.751 --> 21:16.710
I told you, he made me do it.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.842
- Did he make you
put him in the trunk, huh?

21:18.886 --> 21:20.931
Did he make you leave
without calling the cops?

21:20.975 --> 21:23.717
- Agent LaCroix, please...

21:25.893 --> 21:27.634
- Craig Osterholm was kidnapped

21:27.677 --> 21:29.026
at gunpoint
from his aunt's house.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.854
- Did we get an ID?
- Nope.

21:30.898 --> 21:32.987
The aunt didn't recognize
the assailant.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.336
She just described him
as white male,

21:34.380 --> 21:36.512
large build, dark hair.
- Damn it.

21:36.556 --> 21:37.948
- Well, that's not all.

21:37.992 --> 21:40.299
Homer Cortland's prints
were in the system.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.605
He's had a half a dozen run-ins
with the law over the years,

21:42.649 --> 21:44.346
so they would've popped.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.434
The fingerprints
at the crime scene

21:45.478 --> 21:46.827
are definitely not his.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.916
- Looks like our unsub
is still in the wind.

21:50.439 --> 21:52.006
- Let's go with the theory that

21:52.049 --> 21:54.748
Daniel Osterholm's death was
essentially a suicide, right?

21:54.791 --> 21:56.837
That he didn't kill
Jeanine and Darcy.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.361
- Daniel's financial crimes

21:59.405 --> 22:01.711
were ongoing
over nearly two years.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.887
The fact they're coming
to light now is a coincidence

22:03.931 --> 22:05.585
and has nothing to do
with our fugitive.

22:05.628 --> 22:08.849
- Let's focus on our unsub.
The prints from Laine's house

22:08.892 --> 22:11.373
match the prints
from the original crime scene.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.375
So the person
who abducted Craig

22:13.419 --> 22:15.377
is the same person
that killed Jeanine and Darcy.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.857
- But if our unsub wanted
to kill Craig,

22:16.900 --> 22:18.380
why didn't he just shoot him
when he found him?

22:18.424 --> 22:20.382
- Craig's aunt heard him
asking him

22:20.426 --> 22:22.863
what it felt like to see
his entire family torn apart.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.952
- That's someone with a grudge.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.519
- We need to visit
Craig Osterholm's

22:26.562 --> 22:27.911
college friends,

22:27.955 --> 22:29.043
find out who had
a problem with him.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.924
- Where have you been?
- Out.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.753
- "Out."
"Out," that's no answer.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.755
- What are you doing?

22:45.799 --> 22:49.803
- What do you think I'm doing?
You know what day tomorrow is.

22:52.501 --> 22:53.850
- A birthday cake?

22:55.765 --> 22:56.984
Michelle.

22:59.465 --> 23:02.337
Have you eaten anything today?
- Don't.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.774
You know how much
Brittany loves her birthday.

23:04.818 --> 23:07.429
It would be just like her to
come home on her 21st birthday.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.996
I've put fresh sheets
on the bed.

23:10.476 --> 23:11.999
- She's not coming home.

23:12.042 --> 23:14.958
Not today, not tomorrow,
not any day.

23:15.002 --> 23:17.352
- Why would you say that to me?
Don't you say it.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.441
- We got to face facts.
- There's only one fact:

23:19.485 --> 23:22.444
she's missing.
Missing, not dead.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.011
Don't you dare give up hope.

23:25.795 --> 23:27.623

- You don't know anything.
You're never here.

23:31.627 --> 23:33.455
- I'm sorry.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.631
- Till I put my girl
in the ground,

23:35.675 --> 23:37.894
I will never,
never give up hope.

23:42.159 --> 23:43.726
Where are you going?

23:43.770 --> 23:45.902
- I need to clear my head.
I'm taking the boat out.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.513
- You're a damn coward,

23:47.556 --> 23:50.907
a pathetic excuse for a father
and a husband.

24:01.483 --> 24:02.832

24:17.978 --> 24:21.068
about who Craig might
or might not have issues with.

24:21.111 --> 24:23.723
He hasn't been part of
the frat scene for a while now.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.507
Moved off campus and back
into his parent's house.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.117
- Craig had a reputation.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.859
- For what?

24:29.903 --> 24:31.731
- Different things, I guess.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.081
- I can't say for sure,
but it probably had

24:34.124 --> 24:37.519
something to do with
the pool he was fishing in.

24:37.563 --> 24:38.868
- What do you mean, like women?

24:38.912 --> 24:40.914
- He went
through girlfriends fast.

24:40.957 --> 24:42.611
- Pool kind of shrunk for him.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.047
- There might be
women on campus

24:44.091 --> 24:45.962
who say that
he was controlling,

24:46.006 --> 24:48.095
abusive if he didn't
get his way.

24:48.138 --> 24:50.053
- He was a chick magnet
when he first got here.

24:50.097 --> 24:52.665
Rich guy, powerful family...

24:52.708 --> 24:54.710
- So he started having
trouble getting dates.

24:54.754 --> 24:58.105
- His name was on a list,
an unofficial campus list.

24:58.148 --> 25:01.064
Top ten #MeToo offenders.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.588
He got cancelled.

25:06.026 --> 25:08.158
- I have a name and
a face for our unsub.

25:08.202 --> 25:10.509
- Really?
How?

25:10.552 --> 25:14.208
- Magic.
My kind of magic.

25:14.251 --> 25:15.514
I knew
there had to be something

25:15.557 --> 25:17.516
with the unidentified DNA.

25:17.559 --> 25:18.865
Even though he's not
in the database,

25:18.908 --> 25:20.910
no criminal record,
no military history,

25:20.954 --> 25:22.738
with the DNA,
we had to get somewhere.

25:22.782 --> 25:25.611
- So you matched his DNA?
- Well, not quite.

25:25.654 --> 25:28.570
I widened the net
to include all familial matches

25:28.614 --> 25:31.094
with the database,
including NAMUS.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.618
- Missing persons.
- Yeah.

25:32.661 --> 25:34.707
Now,
families of missing persons

25:34.750 --> 25:36.491
can upload
the missing person's DNA,

25:36.535 --> 25:38.580
say, a toothbrush,
a coffee cup,

25:38.624 --> 25:40.147
a hairbrush,
enough for a DNA sample.

25:40.190 --> 25:42.584
- So our unsub is related
to a missing person.

25:42.628 --> 25:45.282
- There's 99.5% chance that

25:45.326 --> 25:46.675

25:59.732 --> 26:01.995
- Update from Jess.
Caleb Walsh isn't home.

26:02.038 --> 26:04.432
His wife said he went off
on his own for a few days.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.521
He went crab fishing,
but she doesn't know where.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.305
- And does Jess believe her?

26:08.349 --> 26:11.265
- Yeah, he said
he thinks she's in the dark.

26:11.308 --> 26:14.181
I mean, she's suffering
pretty major PTSS in relation

26:14.224 --> 26:15.312
to her daughter's
disappearance,

26:15.356 --> 26:16.836
to the point of delusion.

26:16.879 --> 26:19.316
She seemed to think that Jess

about the day
of Brittany's disappearance.

Caleb Walsh is living with,

26:26.410 --> 26:29.065
then likely, his endgame
goes back to his daughter.

26:29.718 --> 26:33.113
- Brittany Walsh.
- A local kid from Easton.

26:33.156 --> 26:35.245
Easton is
a rougher part of town

26:35.289 --> 26:37.552
than Chesapeake Beach,
where the Osterholms live.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.423

26:42.383 --> 26:44.646
which is a year ago tomorrow.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.343
- And that could be
what triggered Walsh.

26:46.387 --> 26:49.129
- What was the outcome of that
missing persons investigation?

26:49.172 --> 26:51.610
- I mean, that was just it.
The case was open,

26:51.653 --> 26:53.002
but there wasn't
much investigating.

26:56.832 --> 26:59.139
- Okay, hold on.
According to this,

26:59.182 --> 27:01.010
Brittany was dating
Craig Osterholm.

27:02.490 --> 27:04.405
- The women on campus
cancelled Craig,

27:04.448 --> 27:06.668
so he went looking for
someone with less power

27:06.712 --> 27:08.452
on the wrong side of town.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.368
- Domestic violence
is progressive.

27:11.412 --> 27:13.240
It doesn't just pop up
out of nowhere.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.502
- Well, if their relationship
was rocky,

27:14.545 --> 27:16.025
there might be a record of it.

27:16.069 --> 27:17.113
I'll let Jess know.

27:19.333 --> 27:22.553
- We responded to several calls
at Brittany Walsh's apartment

27:22.597 --> 27:24.686
before she went missing.
- Domestic abuse calls?

27:24.730 --> 27:27.646
- I don't know.
Domestic disturbances?

27:27.689 --> 27:29.560
- She was dating
Craig Osterholm.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.475
Was he abusing her?

27:31.519 --> 27:33.564
- She'd say he was,
then she'd say he wasn't.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.262
Never wanted to press charges.

27:35.305 --> 27:38.221
- Well, that's common
with victims of abuse.

27:38.265 --> 27:41.398
- When Brittany went missing,
did you question Craig?

27:41.442 --> 27:44.053
- We're just a tiny town PD.

27:44.097 --> 27:46.055
I don't have the manpower
or resources

27:46.099 --> 27:47.317
to conduct
that kind of investigation.

27:47.361 --> 27:48.797
So I turned it over

27:48.841 --> 27:50.364
to Calvert County
Sheriff's Office.

- Was that Sheriff Lewis?

27:51.626 --> 27:53.497

Why?

27:53.541 --> 27:55.630
- His wife is
Jeanine Osterholm's cousin.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.502
It didn't seem like
a potential conflict to you?

27:58.546 --> 28:00.591
- Maybe if I'd known,
but I didn't.

28:00.635 --> 28:03.333
I just assumed they'd handle it
like any other case,

28:03.377 --> 28:04.465
like professionals.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.731

about your investigation

disappearance.

28:11.515 --> 28:15.128

Uh...that was a while back.

28:15.171 --> 28:17.739
I--I'd have to look it up.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.175
- It was a year ago.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.307
Pretty sure you remember it,

28:20.350 --> 28:21.569
because her abusive boyfriend

28:21.612 --> 28:23.136
is the son
of your wife's cousin.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.314
- All right,
it's not what you think.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.272
- Well, what I think is,
you failed to investigate

28:29.316 --> 28:31.318
the prime suspect in
Brittany Walsh's disappearance

28:31.361 --> 28:32.667
because he's a relative
of yours.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.538
- All right, now hold on.

28:34.582 --> 28:36.236
All right,
it's not like there was much

28:36.279 --> 28:38.891

- She's still missing.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.240

Sometimes adults leave.

28:40.283 --> 28:41.763
They just take off.

28:41.807 --> 28:44.157
That doesn't mean there was
anything criminal going on.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.594

with a straight face?

28:46.637 --> 28:48.727
- Did you know
that Craig Osterholm

28:48.770 --> 28:50.119
was abusing her?
- No.

28:50.163 --> 28:51.817
No charges were ever filed.

28:51.860 --> 28:54.428
Every time she made
a complaint, she withdrew it.

desperately trying

29:03.567 --> 29:04.655
to find

the Osterholms a favor.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.621
Think about it this way,

that caused the murders

29:17.756 --> 29:19.496
They were killed

29:20.846 --> 29:22.586
of a young woman

29:24.414 --> 29:27.156
And law enforcement did nothing
to try to find her.

29:30.943 --> 29:34.163
You did nothing,

Never really understood why

30:06.369 --> 30:08.328
a college kid with money
was hanging out here.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.591
I warned Britt to be on guard,

her prince charming.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.856

30:14.900 --> 30:16.771
- He screamed at her
all the time,

30:16.815 --> 30:19.861
so loud I could hear him down
here when the bar was packed.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.907
I called the cops a few times.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.214
They'd go up there,

30:25.258 --> 30:26.868

- Threatened to all the time,
but in the end,

30:30.611 --> 30:33.701
