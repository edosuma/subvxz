[light music]

00:09.259 --> 00:11.845
- Things are good,
they really are.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.596
We have a lot of fun together.

00:13.638 --> 00:16.683
I mean, he's thoughtful
and romantic,

00:16.725 --> 00:18.184
and he surprises me.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.729
- I'm sensing a "but" coming.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.523
- But he puts up walls.

00:23.565 --> 00:27.736
Any time I try to ask him about
his day or his childhood,

00:27.777 --> 00:29.738
he finds a way
to steer it back to me.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.698
- And do you not enjoy that?

00:31.740 --> 00:34.034
Some people like getting
to talk about themselves.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.201
- I do.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.370
I think it's really sweet
that he listens.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.497
But I want to be closer.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.041
His job is hard.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.334
He treats kids with cancer.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.793
- Oh, my goodness.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.712
- And I get not wanting
to bring that home with him,

00:45.754 --> 00:49.174
but I want him to know he can
talk to me about everything.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.845
- And how do you feel
about this, Todd?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.013
Do you feel like
there are things

00:55.055 --> 00:56.389
you don't talk to Maya about?

00:58.016 --> 01:00.352
- No, that's not me at all.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.103
Ask anybody I've worked with
at the hospital

01:02.145 --> 01:04.105
for the last 15 years.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.899
Dr. Todd's an open book!

[rock music]

01:08.943 --> 01:11.696
* *

01:11.738 --> 01:14.741
- You hated that.
- I didn't hate it, okay?

01:14.783 --> 01:16.076
All right, I did hate it
a little bit,

01:16.117 --> 01:17.786
but me being open

01:17.827 --> 01:21.373
is me telling you
that I hate it, so I'm cured.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.416
That Dr. Kristen is good.
- [laughs]

01:23.458 --> 01:26.044
Look, I know we haven't
been together that long,

01:26.086 --> 01:28.171
but it's just,
I really like you.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.589
I'm too old
to be playing games.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.133
- Girl, I'm not playing games.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.718
You wanna know more about me?
- Yes.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.220
- Okay, all right,
all right, here we go.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.513
Um...
- Okay.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.264
- Three.
- Three what?

01:38.306 --> 01:39.432
- Number of times
I peed in the bed

01:39.474 --> 01:40.725
after watching "Predator 2."

01:40.767 --> 01:42.435
- Oh, my God, stop!

01:42.477 --> 01:44.104
I don't wanna hear
about some movie you saw.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.522
Get deep with me, Todd.
- [sighs]

01:45.563 --> 01:47.190
Okay, all right.
I'm building up to it.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.609
Um...11.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.652
- 11 what?

01:50.694 --> 01:52.445
- I was 11 years old
when I found out

01:52.487 --> 01:53.780
Santa Claus wasn't real.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.241
- Aww, so you're
that kinda cute, okay.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.575
- See, I don't wanna
even tell you nine,

01:57.617 --> 01:58.827
'cause I ain't want you
to think of me like this.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.620
I want you to know
your man is tough.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.539
- I don't need
all your traumas.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.457
I just wanna, like,
meet some of your work friends

02:04.499 --> 02:06.334
and maybe see a picture of you
from childhood.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.460
- I wanna see
a picture you, too,

02:07.502 --> 02:09.295
and not some cheerleading
glamour shot.

02:09.337 --> 02:10.630
I want those awkward years.

02:10.672 --> 02:11.923
Talkin' 'bout
one big front tooth

02:11.965 --> 02:13.466
and one little front tooth.
- [laughs]

02:13.508 --> 02:14.592
- Okay?
I want that chaos mouth.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.803
- You're so stupid.
You're so stupid.

[light funky music]

02:29.315 --> 02:30.650
- Hi, Dr. Todd.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.861
- Hey, how you doin', Duncan?

02:36.740 --> 02:38.283
Yo, Dame!

02:40.869 --> 02:42.662
Dame!

02:42.704 --> 02:44.998
- [screaming]

[eerie music]

02:48.043 --> 02:49.502

02:49.544 --> 02:51.504
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

02:51.546 --> 02:53.089
- This motherfucker.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.050
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- [grumbles]

02:55.091 --> 02:56.509
[whirring]

02:56.551 --> 03:00.180
- Yeah!
[laughs]

03:00.221 --> 03:01.264
- The fuck are you doing?

03:01.306 --> 03:02.682
- I got a hover drone.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.685
I'm on my Green Goblin shit.
- But why?

03:05.727 --> 03:07.270
- Well, you know how I been
afraid of the road

03:07.312 --> 03:08.980
ever since I got hit
by that truck?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.899
Ain't no trucks in the sky.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.026
Before you pass judgment,
man, peep it.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.362
[beeps]
[motor whirring]

03:15.403 --> 03:18.031
Gravity ain't got shit on me!

03:18.073 --> 03:20.825
[laughs]
[beeping]

03:20.867 --> 03:23.661
Oh, oh!
[grunts]

03:25.455 --> 03:27.290
And it says that if I lose
a couple hundred pounds,

03:27.332 --> 03:28.333
it get even higher.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.334
- How much that shit cost?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.835
- Like 10 grand.
- 10 grand?

03:30.877 --> 03:33.421
- But my dude Bugs says
it's a good investment.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.090
- You're getting
financial advice

03:35.131 --> 03:36.383
from some dude named Bugs?

03:36.424 --> 03:38.385
- Yeah. Bugs is smart.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.928
He got in on Uber early.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.137
He was the second driver.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.640
- You can't keep
wasting money, Dame!

03:43.682 --> 03:45.934
[whispering] We're on the run
from Rodney Lamonca, remember?

03:45.975 --> 03:46.976
- What?

03:47.018 --> 03:48.395
All I heard was
"on the run," bro.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.063
- Get your ass in the house!

03:50.105 --> 03:52.482
Get your ass in the house!

03:53.983 --> 03:56.403
This bag of cash is all we have
left, and we're running low.

03:56.444 --> 03:59.739
So please, no more $10,000
Green Goblin drones.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.908
Actually, I'ma be an asshole
and go ahead and say,

04:01.950 --> 04:04.160
no more Green Goblin drones
at any price.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.286
- I mean,
if it's money we need,

04:05.328 --> 04:07.080
we could always rob a bank.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.707
Bugs says Phoenix a soft town.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.125
- No, no, no,
we don't want to attract

04:10.166 --> 04:11.292
any attention to ourselves.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.877
No crimes, no scams.

04:12.919 --> 04:13.920
- [scoffs]

04:13.962 --> 04:15.672
No scams?

04:15.714 --> 04:17.882
What about that scam that you
running on that Maya chick?

04:17.924 --> 04:19.342
- That's real.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.802
Maya's my girlfriend.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.345
I went to therapy
with her today.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.430
Ain't no scam worth that.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.015
- But you didn't go to therapy.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.182
Dr. Todd did.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.934
- Okay, fine, yes,
she thinks I'm a doctor.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.020
It's a stupid-ass lie
that I told when we first met

04:30.061 --> 04:31.896
'cause I had three Jack
and Cokes on an empty stomach,

04:31.938 --> 04:34.399
and I ain't think
we'd be falling in love.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.984
Haven't you lied
about something before?

04:37.152 --> 04:38.903
- Remember I told you
about that hover drone

04:38.945 --> 04:40.530
costing 10 grand?

04:41.531 --> 04:43.324
It was really 15.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.326
- We takin' that shit back
right now.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.495
Where Bugs live?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.581
- Yo, Dame Train!
What can I do for you today?

04:49.622 --> 04:52.125
Ooh, I just got
some new 3D TVs.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.626
You want a T-shirt cannon?

04:53.668 --> 04:56.004
Bet you guys came here
in a boring-ass car.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.798
How'd you like to go home
on a mini motorcycle?

04:58.840 --> 04:59.883
- Oh, damn.

04:59.924 --> 05:00.967
- Everybody's all looking
at you like,

05:01.009 --> 05:02.469
"Hey, who's that?
What's their story?"

05:02.510 --> 05:04.554
- No, no, we just wanna
keep a low profile.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.639
- Oh, no, mini motorcycle
is low as shit.

05:06.681 --> 05:07.640
It's like an inch
off the ground.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.351
- I said no. Thanks.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.727
- Wait, I know who this is.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.479
Mr. Isaiah Clifton Foster.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.147
Hey, nice to meet you, bro.
- What?

05:14.189 --> 05:15.774
The fuck, Dame?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.650
How this fool
know my real name?

05:17.692 --> 05:19.819
- I mean, he told me
about his divorce,

05:19.861 --> 05:21.946
so I figured I had to open up
to him about something.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.115
But don't worry, I ain't
give him no other details.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.784
- Hey, how's stuff
with Craig, by the way?

05:25.825 --> 05:26.868
I know
there's a lot of anger there,

05:26.910 --> 05:29.454
but you only get
one brother, right?

05:29.496 --> 05:32.082
- I'm sorry, Bugs, was it?

05:32.123 --> 05:34.042
Could you please forget
everything you know about me?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.543
- I see how it is.
You got trust issues.

05:35.585 --> 05:36.836
Hey, that's why I think
it's good

05:36.878 --> 05:38.213
that Maya is bringing you
to therapy.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.048
- Oh, I swear to fuckin' God!

05:40.090 --> 05:42.550
- Hey, I'm sorry.
Now look, now we're fighting.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.053
Hey, what you say
we just start all over?

05:45.095 --> 05:46.763
Would you like to do
a little bit of coke?

05:46.805 --> 05:48.014
- No!

05:48.056 --> 05:49.849
I just wanna return
this Green Goblin drone

05:49.891 --> 05:50.850
you sold my boy.

05:50.892 --> 05:51.976
- Seems like
it'd be pretty funny

05:52.018 --> 05:54.771
to be on a drone all coked up,
but okay.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.065
Anyway, I don't have
the 20 grand.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.400
- 20 grand, Dame?

05:58.441 --> 05:59.526
What happened to 15?

05:59.567 --> 06:01.653
- But here's what I can do
for you.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.113
I could take it back
for store credit.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.447
Bugs Money.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.907
- I want cash,
not fuckin' Bugs Money.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.158
- Oh, well, if it's cash
you need,

06:07.200 --> 06:08.201
I mean, Phoenix is a soft town.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.744
- We're not committing
any crimes.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.204
- Gonna have to do
something eventually.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.123
That one little bag of cash
not gon' last forever.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.541
- There's better ways
to get paid, Dame.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.418
- Like what?
- I don't know, we--

06:16.459 --> 06:17.752
we can get legit jobs.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.671
- Oh, you're sick, man.
- This motherfucker.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.880
- How you gonna get a job?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.799
Dr. Todd can't pass
a background check,

06:22.841 --> 06:25.385
and you don't want to be
paying taxes as Isaiah Foster,

06:25.427 --> 06:26.428
'cause then your boy

06:26.469 --> 06:27.554
Rodney Lamonca's
gonna find you,

06:27.595 --> 06:28.763
and since
you're the only person

06:28.805 --> 06:30.598
that knows
that he killed Noah--

06:30.640 --> 06:32.350
- Stop knowing shit
about my life!

06:32.392 --> 06:34.602
- Wait.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.022
If you're willing
to use up your Bugs Money,

06:37.063 --> 06:39.065
I might have
a solution for y'all.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.609
So my boy works
at the Department of Records.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.695
He issues
the death certificates.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.531
But sometimes he, um...

06:46.573 --> 06:49.743
"forgets" to issue
the death certificates.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.494
- You talking for real forgets

06:51.536 --> 06:53.079
or crime guy forgets?

06:53.121 --> 06:54.789
- You know I'm talking
crime guy.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.208
- Nice.
- Yeah, so if someone dies,

06:57.250 --> 06:58.501
and they ain't got no family,

06:58.543 --> 07:00.420
my guy sells their info
to the highest bidder.

07:00.462 --> 07:01.629
- So this is a new identity.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.548
- Social Security number,
birth date,

07:03.590 --> 07:05.258
list of previous residences,

07:05.300 --> 07:08.303
everything you need to become
a upstanding citizen.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.555
* Won't nobody know it's you *

07:10.597 --> 07:12.223
* It's just so fresh
and clean *

07:12.265 --> 07:13.767
- * So fresh
and so clean, clean *

07:13.808 --> 07:16.227
- * You're becoming
someone new *

07:16.269 --> 07:18.104
both: * It's just
so fresh, so clean *

07:18.146 --> 07:19.939
- * So fresh
and so clean, clean *

07:19.981 --> 07:20.940
- So I'm--
- I'm like, I'm like,

07:20.982 --> 07:22.442
what's even going on right now?

07:22.484 --> 07:24.110
- [laughs]
- I am now...

07:24.152 --> 07:25.987
Marty Simkowitz?

07:26.029 --> 07:27.322
- Damn.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.032
Hey, that feels like
it's always been your name.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.617
- You think people really gon'
buy this shit?

07:30.658 --> 07:32.202
- They buy me as a doctor.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.495
You've seen the neighbors.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.330
I get, like,
20 "Hi, Dr. Todds" a day.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.332
- Yeah, but we in Phoenix.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.085
Those "Hi, Dr. Todds,"
that's not them being friendly.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.962
That's, "Hi, I'm watching
your Black ass, Dr. Todd."

07:43.004 --> 07:44.714
- I don't know
what he's going on about.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.424
I mean, like,
there's hella Black people

07:46.466 --> 07:47.717
in Arizona, right?

07:47.759 --> 07:50.887
There's you guys.
Um...

07:50.929 --> 07:53.807
Damn. Oh, there's, like,
a bunch of the Phoenix Suns.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.183
Y'all are thriving up in here!

07:55.225 --> 07:56.893
- Okay, you guarantee
this is gonna work?

07:56.935 --> 07:58.603
You'll pay me back
if I can't get a job with this,

07:58.645 --> 07:59.979
and not fuckin' Bugs Money.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.148
- Hey, okay, let's calm down.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.109
There is no need
to besmirch Bugs Money.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.195
- Mm-hmm.
- But yes, I guarantee.

08:07.237 --> 08:10.949
It's all gonna turn out fine,
Mr. Simkowitz.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.784
- Mr. Simkowitz is my dad.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.494
Call me Marty.
- Marty.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.121
Look, I'm in love with you.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.997
I was blown away
by your interview.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.834
I mean, the passion that you
have for energy brokering.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.044
- What can I say?
It's what I live for.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.671
The thrill of...

08:24.713 --> 08:27.007
brokering energy.

08:27.048 --> 08:30.218
- I would have hired you
on the spot, but we have HR,

08:30.260 --> 08:32.679
and they make us do these full
criminal background checks.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.973
And yours came back,

08:35.015 --> 08:36.808
and I do have one question.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.020
[tense music]

08:40.061 --> 08:42.480
* *

08:42.522 --> 08:43.606
When can you start?

08:43.648 --> 08:44.774
[both laugh]

08:44.816 --> 08:46.151
You aced it, bro!

08:46.192 --> 08:47.527
Fuckin' Simkowitz!

08:47.569 --> 08:48.945
- Hey, Marty.
- Marty.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.905
- [laughs]
- Fuckin' Marty!

08:50.947 --> 08:52.365
- Looks like that forehead
hit puberty...

08:52.407 --> 08:53.450
- [laughs] Oh, really?

08:53.491 --> 08:54.784
- Before the rest
of your body did.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.037
You look like a little
mini Tommy from "Martin."

08:57.078 --> 08:58.830
- That's 'cause my brother was
a bad photographer.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.248
He didn't know
how to work them angles.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.583
- Wait, you have a brother?

09:01.624 --> 09:03.335
- Yep.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.462
- Okay, anything else
you wanna share about him

09:05.503 --> 09:07.839
besides he took a bad photo
of you 30 years ago?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.215
- Sorry I didn't
mention it earlier,

09:09.257 --> 09:11.384
but we kinda had a little bit
of a rough patch.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.845
But I'm open now, so go ahead.

09:13.887 --> 09:14.763
What you wanna know
about Craig?

09:14.804 --> 09:16.222
- Craig. Okay.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.391
So where does Craig live?
- Florida.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.893
- Older or younger?
- Older.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.061
- And what does he do?

09:21.102 --> 09:24.064
- He's a farmer,
which sounds weird.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.107
He grows saw palmetto berries.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.817
They put 'em in a lot
of men's health supplements.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.319
It's a billion-dollar industry.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.737
It's actually pretty smart.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.073
- So what happened?
Why the rough patch?

09:33.114 --> 09:35.241
- Guess I always expect him
to have my back,

09:35.283 --> 09:36.743
and one day he didn't.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.954
But I'm sure he's feeling
really bad about it.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.289
He calls me every day,

09:41.331 --> 09:43.583
leaving voice mails
like a psycho.

09:43.625 --> 09:44.834
- Why don't you pick up?

09:44.876 --> 09:46.086
What, you're afraid
he's gonna say something

09:46.127 --> 09:47.337
you don't want to hear?
- All right.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.631
That's enough, Dr. Kristen.
- [laughs]

09:49.673 --> 09:51.758
- Okay, I'ma talk to him
when I'm ready.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.469
- Aww, well, I'm glad
you shared that with me.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.762
Okay, you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

09:55.804 --> 09:56.971
- This is my picture.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.431
It's from fourth grade.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.600
And don't ask me why I look
like a yacht captain.

10:00.642 --> 10:01.643
[suspenseful music]

10:01.685 --> 10:03.478
Cute.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.772
[muffled chatter]

10:05.814 --> 10:10.276
* *

10:10.318 --> 10:12.362
Todd.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.613
Todd.
- Huh?

10:13.655 --> 10:15.156
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry,
I was just--

10:15.198 --> 10:16.282
[both laugh]

10:16.324 --> 10:18.785
Let's see Captain Maya, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.286
[both laugh]

10:22.997 --> 10:24.833
- Ears built
like a African drum.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.252
- I know you not talking.
- [chanting]

10:27.293 --> 10:29.129
- That forehead was like,
"Damn, Gina!"

10:29.170 --> 10:31.047
Like, it's out there.
[both laugh]

10:31.089 --> 10:32.674
Whatever.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.551
So you coming over tonight?

10:34.592 --> 10:35.802
- Huh?
- Yeah.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.429
- Yeah, yeah.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.055
You know, I would, but I got
a surgery in the morning,

10:39.097 --> 10:40.640
and I kinda wanna
be fresh for it.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.183
- Well, give me a kiss.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.520
[engine turns over]

10:45.562 --> 10:48.523
[tense music]

10:48.565 --> 10:55.697
* *

11:21.389 --> 11:23.016
- Whatever Rodney Lamonca's
paying you,

11:23.058 --> 11:24.267
I could pay you more!

11:28.897 --> 11:30.774
- Who the fuck is
Rodney Lamonca?

11:30.815 --> 11:32.442
- The guy you're working for.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.945
- No, I work
for American West Receivables.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.989
I'm a debt collector.

11:38.031 --> 11:42.202
And you owe us $73,000,
Mr. Simkowitz.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.079
- Okay, I'm sorry, man,
but you got the wrong guy.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.289
- I've got
the right guy, Marty.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.125
348 South Cactus Shadow Lane.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.543
Oh, congrats on the new job,
by the way.

11:50.585 --> 11:51.878
- Look, I'm telling you, man--
- You know what?

11:51.920 --> 11:53.129
Did you really think

11:53.171 --> 11:55.215
that we were gonna stop
looking for you?

11:55.256 --> 11:59.469
Did you really think
that RadioShack would forget?

11:59.511 --> 12:00.845
- RadioShack?

12:00.887 --> 12:02.597
Oh, come on, man, RadioShack
went out of business.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.599
- But debts never die, Marty.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.726
American West bought up
your account,

12:06.768 --> 12:09.896
which means you owe us now.

12:09.938 --> 12:13.942
73,000 large.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.485
- Do I look like
a Marty Simkowitz to you?

12:15.527 --> 12:16.695
My name's Todd.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.322
- No, no, you don't get
to do that, Marty.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.657
You don't just
snap your fingers

12:20.699 --> 12:22.075
and become someone else.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.993
You made a mistake.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.830
There have to be consequences.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.665
That's how the past works.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.667
[dramatic music]

12:30.709 --> 12:32.377
It sticks with you.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.213
[phone chimes]

12:38.008 --> 12:42.012
Hmm. 9:00.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.514
Saved by the bell.

12:47.058 --> 12:52.605
See you soon, Marty.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.608
[tense music]

12:55.650 --> 13:02.574
* *

13:04.617 --> 13:07.287
- Hi, Dr. Todd.

13:18.590 --> 13:22.344
- Hey, yo, Dame!

13:22.385 --> 13:26.639
[muffled yell]
[banging]

13:26.681 --> 13:28.350

[groaning]

13:41.363 --> 13:44.449
[music intensifies]

13:48.828 --> 13:50.246
- Aw, what the fuck?

13:50.288 --> 13:52.582
Dame, the hell are you doing?

13:52.624 --> 13:54.417
- Zay? [groans]

13:54.459 --> 13:55.710
[laughs]

13:55.752 --> 13:58.254
It's a light therapy mask.
Bugs sold it to me.

13:58.296 --> 14:01.716
He says it harnesses
the awesome powers of lasers

14:01.758 --> 14:03.551
to refresh your complexion.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.261
This desert been
drying my ass out, man.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.763
- Why you banging
around the bathroom?

14:06.805 --> 14:09.182
- Oh, that's because I couldn't
find the door handle,

14:09.224 --> 14:10.600
you know, 'cause all I see
is red shit.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.477
- Then take off
the mask, dumbass!

14:12.519 --> 14:13.978
- Uh-uh. No.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.106
They say you have to leave
this thing on for 60 minutes.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.482
It'll beep when it's done.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.567
[mask beeps]
Oh, there it is.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.570
How do I look?

14:22.612 --> 14:24.447
I look younger?
- You look naked.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.449
- That's 'cause I also bought
a robot that sucks your dick.

14:26.491 --> 14:29.077
- Stop buying shit from Bugs,

14:29.119 --> 14:30.495
and lock the front door
next time.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.455

14:32.497 --> 14:34.165

14:42.090 --> 14:44.968
[phone buzzes]

14:45.010 --> 14:46.803
What the fuck?

14:46.845 --> 14:49.723
[phone chiming]

14:55.186 --> 14:56.813
[phone ringing]
Huh?

14:56.855 --> 15:01.109
[knocking at door]

15:01.151 --> 15:02.610
Coming!

15:04.529 --> 15:06.364
Who the fuck are you?
- Hello, Mr. Simkowitz.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.616
I'm with New Horizon
Collection Services,

15:08.658 --> 15:10.326
and you owe $18,000

15:10.368 --> 15:12.328
to Federal Health
Conglomerated.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.830
- Wait, this isn't
about RadioShack?

15:13.872 --> 15:15.165
- Hey there, Marty.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.000
So glad to finally put
a face to a name.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.710
I'm from Baseline
Recovery Associates.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.086
Can I come in?
- No.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.671
- Can I come in?

15:21.713 --> 15:24.090
- What y'all can both do
is get the fuck off my porch.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.675
I'm not having strangers
in my house.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.011
- [grunts] I'm not a stranger.
We're old friends.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.763
- We are not fuckin' friends!

15:29.804 --> 15:30.930
- Marty.
- Marty.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.015
- Marty.
- Mr. Simkowitz.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.016
- Marty.
- Marty!

15:33.058 --> 15:34.225
[knocking at door]

15:34.267 --> 15:36.186
- Marty, Marty,
you can't run from this.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.354
- Marty!
- Mr. Simkowitz.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.938
[knocking]
- Open up the door!

15:38.980 --> 15:40.273
- Marty--

15:40.315 --> 15:41.441
- Yo, Zay, man,
what the fuck is going on?

15:41.483 --> 15:42.776
- We gotta go find Bugs, man.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.277
There's something wrong
with identity he sold me.

15:44.319 --> 15:45.445
[knocking]
- Marty, hey.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.946
- Oh, shit, they everywhere.
- Marty!

15:46.988 --> 15:49.407
- I mean,
if somebody ain't get rid

15:49.449 --> 15:51.034
of that Green Goblin drone
we had,

15:51.076 --> 15:52.952
we could just fly up out this--
- Man, get dressed!

15:52.994 --> 15:54.412
We'll go out the back, fool.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.502
- Hi, Dr. Todd.

16:00.543 --> 16:01.670
- Duncan!

16:01.711 --> 16:02.921
What's up, my man?

16:02.962 --> 16:05.131
- I don't know if you saw,

16:05.173 --> 16:07.717
but you have
quite a few visitors.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.928
- Yes, Duncan.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.721
Thank you, Duncan.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.225
[phone ringing]

16:15.266 --> 16:17.227
What kinda fuckin' name
is Bugs, anyway?

16:17.268 --> 16:19.229
Fuckin' cartoon rabbit
motherfucker!

16:20.605 --> 16:22.273
Yo, Bugs!

16:26.945 --> 16:28.530
- Oh, shit.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.243
So that's why I got such
a good deal on the SuckBot.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.203
Going out of business sale.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.289
- What the hell?

16:41.543 --> 16:43.712
"Dear Marty,
sorry about all this.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.755
"I wish I could explain
this to you in person.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.257
"By the time
you get this letter,

16:47.298 --> 16:48.925
I'll be hundreds of miles
away."

16:48.967 --> 16:51.011
- Shit.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.929
I timed this out wrong.
Damn it.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.264
- What's up, Bugs?

16:54.305 --> 16:55.598
- It's all in the letter.
[chuckles]

16:55.640 --> 16:57.726
I spent a lot of time
on it, too.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.978
Actually some rather beautiful
turns of phrase in there.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.980
But you know what?
I'm just gonna step outside.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.648
That way, you don't have
to read in front of me,

17:03.690 --> 17:05.483
make us both feel
self-conscious.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.068
- Not another fucking step.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.945
- [sighs]

17:08.987 --> 17:10.822
Look, I understand
how you're feeling right now.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.449
If you read the letter,
you'd know

17:12.490 --> 17:14.659
that I bought Marty Simkowitz's
identity a year ago,

17:14.701 --> 17:17.287
and I assumed it was clean,
just like you did.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.455
- You told me it was clean.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.040
I didn't assume anything.

17:20.081 --> 17:22.459
- I mean, you assumed
I was telling you the truth.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.128
- [laughs]
He got you with that, Z.

17:25.170 --> 17:28.798
- It turns out this identity's
changed hands dozens of times.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.885
But the debt collectors
just keep on comin'.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.303
- I don't look like you,

17:33.345 --> 17:35.096
and I definitely don't look
like a Simkowitz.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.806
- They don't care.

17:36.848 --> 17:40.018
The debt gets sold
and sold and sold again.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.228
Corporations don't stop
to ask what we look like.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.230
We're not even people to them.

17:44.272 --> 17:47.400
We're just profits and losses.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.319
Red ink and black.

17:49.361 --> 17:52.989
To them,
we're just numbers on a page.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.491
- That's some good shit, bro.

17:54.532 --> 17:55.575
- It's from the letter.

17:55.617 --> 17:56.868
- So what am I supposed to do?

17:56.910 --> 17:59.079
- Find some other sucker
to pass it on to.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.663
Until then, you gotta hide.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.040
The debt collectors can
come to your house,

18:02.082 --> 18:03.958
but they can't come inside
unless you let them in.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.377
That's why I work from home.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.129
And they can't contact you
before 8:00 a.m.

18:08.171 --> 18:09.673
or after 9:00 p.m.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.258
- I don't wanna know
your dumbass vampire rules.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.968
You're gonna take
this identity back

18:14.010 --> 18:15.512
like you promised me.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.847
I'm done being--
- Marty Simkowitz.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.558
I'm from Castle
Southwest Financial.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.312
You owe $8,000
to Bally Total Fitness.

18:24.354 --> 18:25.689
- Don't look at me.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.274
Guy you wanna talk to
is right over--

18:28.316 --> 18:32.529
* *

18:32.570 --> 18:34.531
Motherfucker, where'd he go?

18:34.572 --> 18:36.491
You didn't even get
his real name?

18:36.533 --> 18:38.284
You're just out here
calling a grown man Bugs?

18:38.326 --> 18:39.994
[phone ringing]
Shit, stop calling me.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.372
- You getting way too
worked up about this, bro.

18:42.414 --> 18:44.666
They can't make you pay.
You ain't Marty.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.668
What you think,
they gonna chase you around

18:46.710 --> 18:48.253
and ruin your relationship
with Maya?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.171
- Yes!
That's what I'm scared of.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.756
- Shit.
[phone rings]

18:51.798 --> 18:53.174
I see that now.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.884
This is a big deal, man.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.553
- Ah, fuck! Maya.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.929
I'm supposed to meet her
for lunch.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.139
Shit.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.766
Where are my scrubs?

19:05.270 --> 19:06.855
- Hi, Dr. Todd.

19:06.896 --> 19:10.275
- Yes, Duncan.
Hello, Duncan, once again!

19:13.361 --> 19:14.904
[phone buzzing]

19:14.946 --> 19:17.407
- So my sister's gonna ask me,
what do I think of her ex.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.616
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm like,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.410
"He's an immature teenage boy

19:20.452 --> 19:21.828
trapped in a 40-year-old man's
body."

19:21.870 --> 19:23.288
- Word?
- And then she says,

19:23.329 --> 19:24.831
"Oh,
we're getting back together."

19:24.873 --> 19:26.958
And I'm like, "Wow, you gonna
go back to that fuckboy?"

19:27.000 --> 19:28.543
Like, I knew it was a setup.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.170
She was just asking me that,
knowing she knows

19:30.211 --> 19:31.463
that I don't even like him.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.131
Stupid.
- Yeah, fuck her.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.591
- My sister?

19:34.632 --> 19:37.927
- Uh, I wasn't even listening.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.763
How about we--
how about we get out of here?

19:39.804 --> 19:40.847
- What is that
supposed to mean?

19:40.889 --> 19:42.390
I don't wanna make out
in your car.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.725
Your seats don't go back
far enough.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.685
- No, babe, like,
we should take a trip.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.354
Maybe go out to the desert,

19:47.395 --> 19:49.439
get a hotel,
just the two of us.

19:49.481 --> 19:51.608
- Okay, look at you
being all impulsive.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.443
Okay, so when
were you thinking?

19:53.485 --> 19:54.611
'Cause next weekend
I have that--

19:54.652 --> 19:55.945
- I think we should go
right now.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.114
- Right now? Right now?
Babe, it's Tuesday.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.866
- Well, I don't have any more
surgeries for the rest

19:59.908 --> 20:02.035
of the week, and you can get
Caleb to do your showings.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.578
Let him be useful for once.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.205
- You just don't like Caleb
'cause he's tall.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.748
- No, I don't like Caleb
'cause you think he's tall.

20:06.790 --> 20:09.084
6'1" is unremarkable.
- All right, let's go.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.128
But I gotta go by the office
and talk to Tall Caleb

20:12.170 --> 20:13.213
and then pack.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.881
- I'll get you at 6:00.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.049
- Okay.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.300
- Or 5:00.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.843
Wanna do 5:00? Let's do 5:00.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.887
- 5:00's good.

20:20.929 --> 20:23.556
This is about to be
so much fun.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.350
Ugh, my phone is about to die,

20:25.392 --> 20:26.518
and I forgot
to bring a charger.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.811
Do you have one?

20:27.852 --> 20:28.770
- What?

20:28.812 --> 20:31.064
Nah, nah, nah.
Left at the crib.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.482
- Oh, we're gonna have
to use your phone

20:32.524 --> 20:34.067
for directions then.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.985
- My phone?
- Yeah.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.278
- It's off right now.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.489
- And you can't
turn it back on?

20:39.531 --> 20:41.366
- Well, I'm trying to be
in the moment,

20:41.408 --> 20:42.992
stay present with you, but--

20:43.034 --> 20:44.536
- [laughs]

20:44.577 --> 20:46.371
[phone chiming]

20:46.413 --> 20:48.540
Somebody's popular.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.417
- Yeah, hospital's on my nuts.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.168
- [laughs]
You're so stupid.

20:52.210 --> 20:55.964
[phone chiming]

20:56.006 --> 20:57.674
What do we got?

20:57.716 --> 21:00.802
Beet chips.
Prickly pear hard candies.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.763
Okay, this isn't normal bougie.
This is stupid bougie.

21:03.805 --> 21:07.142
- Mm-hmm.
[telephone ringing]

21:07.183 --> 21:08.560
- Who could that be?

21:16.234 --> 21:17.360
- Hello?

21:17.402 --> 21:18.611
- I wish you told me you were

21:18.653 --> 21:20.989
planning a trip,
Mr. Simkowitz.

21:21.031 --> 21:22.449
- Nah, we're good.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.867
- How's the room?

21:23.908 --> 21:25.869
Are you enjoying
the prickly pear hard candy?

21:25.910 --> 21:28.538
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Thank you so much.

21:30.415 --> 21:31.708
Just the front desk
checking to see

21:31.750 --> 21:33.501
if we got everything we need.
- Okay, cool.

21:33.543 --> 21:35.295
So you wanna go downstairs,
grab some drinks,

21:35.337 --> 21:37.213
check out the hot tub?

21:37.255 --> 21:39.758
- Or we just go to the bedroom.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.010
Go to sleep. Call it a night.

21:42.052 --> 21:43.470
- It's 7:40.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.596
- They say the first day
of the vacation,

21:44.637 --> 21:45.847
you're supposed
to just stay in.

21:45.889 --> 21:48.433
- But aren't we
leaving tomorrow?

21:48.475 --> 21:50.185
- You know what?
You right. You right.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.936
I'm sorry, baby,
for being weird.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.146
- Mm-hmm.

21:53.188 --> 21:54.564
- My penis smells from driving,
so I think

21:54.606 --> 21:55.857
I should just go take
a quick shower.

21:55.899 --> 21:57.359
Just give me a quick second,
all right?

21:57.400 --> 21:59.611
I'll be right back.

21:59.652 --> 22:03.740
[indistinct chatter on TV]

22:03.782 --> 22:06.743
- Lands himself locked up
in jail.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.870
- Baby, that was invigorating.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.580
I needed that. What you up to?

22:10.622 --> 22:12.374
- Sitting here,
watching Mario Lopez

22:12.415 --> 22:13.875
describe the plot
of "Despicable Me 3"

22:13.917 --> 22:15.543
on loop for an hour and a half.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.587
- Gru is back!

22:17.629 --> 22:19.255
- Wow, have I been
in the shower

22:19.297 --> 22:20.799
for an hour and a half?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.092
I'm gonna make it up to you
with a glass of champagne.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.469
- No, champagne's not
gonna do it.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.595
- Wine?
- No!

22:25.637 --> 22:27.055
- Henny?
- Don't play with me.

22:27.097 --> 22:29.599
- Tequila?
- I want a margarita so big,

22:29.641 --> 22:31.101
they're gonna have to mix it
in a trash can.

22:31.142 --> 22:33.978
- Okay, you know what?
One trasharita for my girl.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.147
- Lands himself locked up...
- Oh, my God.

22:38.650 --> 22:40.443
- Now, when you say
"trash can,"

22:40.485 --> 22:42.404
are you thinking one of those
little guys under a desk,

22:42.445 --> 22:45.281
or, like, one of those--
those big dented metal ones?

22:45.323 --> 22:46.700
- Yeah, there you go.

22:46.741 --> 22:49.160
Oscar the Grouch style.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.912
- Hello, Marty.

22:56.251 --> 22:57.585
- Why is this man
calling you Marty?

22:57.627 --> 22:59.087
- I don't know, babe.
I have no idea

22:59.129 --> 23:02.048
why this guy would even be
speaking to us after 9:00 p.m.

23:02.090 --> 23:04.342
- Oh, no. Jeez, you're right.
It is after 9:00.

23:04.384 --> 23:07.637
I'm just gonna, uh,
face zero fucking consequences.

23:07.679 --> 23:09.347
- Todd!
- There are rules against this.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.598
- Todd.
- It's the law.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.058
- Then file a complaint
with the government.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.685
I look forward to seeing you
at my online hearing

23:13.727 --> 23:15.186
in 18 months.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.312
- Todd, what is going on?

23:16.354 --> 23:19.024
- Your boyfriend is a liar
and a crook.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.900
- [laughing]
What? No, no, I'm not.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.402
- His name is not even Todd.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.653
It's Marty Simkowitz,

23:23.695 --> 23:26.031
and he owes $73,000
to RadioShack!

23:26.072 --> 23:27.824
- Hey. Are you Troy Chubner?

23:27.866 --> 23:29.284
- I don't know, Todd, are you?

23:29.325 --> 23:30.618
- What? No.

23:30.660 --> 23:31.911
- I'm Troy Chubner.

23:31.953 --> 23:34.706
- I'm a debt collector
with Keystone Associates.

23:34.748 --> 23:37.375
You owe $12,000 to Home Depot,
Mr. Chubner.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.710
- No, no.
- Yes!

23:38.752 --> 23:40.045
- No.
- Yes!

23:40.086 --> 23:41.463
- No, I already
spoke to someone

23:41.504 --> 23:43.631
at Keystone about this.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.592
Rachel, she said
she was gonna send me

23:45.633 --> 23:46.801
a payment plan in the mail.

23:46.843 --> 23:47.969
- Rachel quit.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.637
- What the fuck is going on?

23:49.679 --> 23:52.932
- Uh, listen,
I'm a debt collector too,

23:52.974 --> 23:55.101
so I know that
everybody always tells you

23:55.143 --> 23:56.936
that they're about to get you
your money, but I am.

23:56.978 --> 23:58.104
I'm about to get you
your money.

23:58.146 --> 24:00.315
This guy is
really close to paying.

24:00.357 --> 24:01.524
Tell him.
- No, I'm not.

24:01.566 --> 24:02.901
- Yes, he is.
- What the fuck is going on?

24:02.942 --> 24:04.319
Wow, I'm leaving, Todd.
- Baby. Baby. Maya.

24:04.361 --> 24:05.779
- This is ridiculous.
- You think I know this dude?

24:05.820 --> 24:07.030
Look at the motherfucker.
- Marty, give me a hand.

24:07.072 --> 24:08.156
- Get off me, man!
- Come on, we're talking--

24:08.198 --> 24:10.575
- Get off of me, man!
- Come on, he's--

24:10.617 --> 24:12.452
[laughs nervously]

24:12.494 --> 24:13.912
Look, he's totally freaked out.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.205
All right, here's the thing.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.374
Home Depot,
they totally messed up.

24:17.415 --> 24:19.626
They sold me
a wicker trash can hideaway,

24:19.668 --> 24:21.378
but raccoons kept
getting into it.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.922
The company even admitted
that the product was defective.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.382
Let me pull up the email.

24:25.423 --> 24:28.551
It's right here.
I got it right here somewhere.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.261
- I know
where you live, Chubner!

24:30.303 --> 24:32.305
- Just wait for me.
I'll be right back.

24:32.347 --> 24:34.974
I swear to God, right back.
- Maya!

24:35.016 --> 24:36.726
- I knew it was too good
to be fuckin' true.

24:36.768 --> 24:38.895
- Maya, wait! Maya!
- Oh, every fuckin' time.

24:38.937 --> 24:40.063
- Girl--
- Every time...

24:40.105 --> 24:41.356
- Maya!
- I open myself up.

24:41.398 --> 24:42.941
- Maya, I'm sorry.
This lunatic thinks

24:42.982 --> 24:44.609
I'm somebody named
Marty Simkowitz.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.694
He came to the hospital.

24:45.735 --> 24:46.903
He's been following me
for days.

24:46.945 --> 24:48.488
- Is that why you wanted
to get out of town?

24:48.530 --> 24:49.823
Why didn't you just say that?

24:49.864 --> 24:51.157
- 'Cause I didn't want you
to be scared, babe.

24:51.199 --> 24:52.701
Because I care about you, girl.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.077
- Bullshit. Bullshit.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.620
You lying straight to my face.
- No, no, I'm not.

24:55.662 --> 24:56.955
I love you, Maya.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.540
- This is everything
that I was afraid of.

24:58.581 --> 25:02.377
- Maya, my name's
not really Todd.

25:04.045 --> 25:06.089
Oh, fuck.
I guess we doin' this.

25:06.131 --> 25:08.341
- So you are Marty Simkowitz?

25:08.383 --> 25:11.011
- No.

25:11.052 --> 25:13.930
My real name is Isaiah Foster.
I'm not a doctor.

25:13.972 --> 25:15.849
- Jesus, Todd!
- Isaiah.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.727
- So has anything
you told me been true?

25:18.768 --> 25:20.937
- Yes!
Everything about my brother.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.314
All right,
everything about my dad dying.

25:23.356 --> 25:24.691
I do like Skittles.

25:24.733 --> 25:26.860
I think that Skittles thing
is, like, my core truth.

25:26.901 --> 25:29.154
Not the moment for jokes.
I feel you.

25:31.614 --> 25:35.410
Look, I came from nothing.

25:35.452 --> 25:38.204
Hustling, scamming,
that's how I survived.

25:38.246 --> 25:41.958
So when I saw you
in that club...

25:42.000 --> 25:43.084
I told you I was a doctor.

25:43.126 --> 25:45.879
- A children's
cancer doctor, Todd.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.255
Isaiah.
- Isaiah.

25:47.297 --> 25:48.256
- Oh, my God.

25:48.298 --> 25:49.341
- Just another lie

25:49.382 --> 25:50.383
in a lifetime of lies.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.469
But the more time
we spent together,

25:52.510 --> 25:54.929
the closer we got,
all I could think about

25:54.971 --> 25:58.600
was how I could--how--
look, I don't know--

25:58.641 --> 26:00.185
- Tell me the truth?
- No.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.562
No, that never
really crossed my mind.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.814
How I could--

26:04.856 --> 26:07.192
God, this is so humiliating--

26:07.233 --> 26:09.444
become Dr. Todd.

26:10.695 --> 26:12.489
Not literally--
I'm too broke and too dumb

26:12.530 --> 26:13.740
to be going to med school.

26:13.782 --> 26:16.451
But I liked the way
that people looked at me.

26:16.493 --> 26:19.329
I liked the way
that you looked at me.

26:19.371 --> 26:22.082
And I was proud of myself
for the first time in my life.

26:22.123 --> 26:23.583
And I know that's so fucked up,

26:23.625 --> 26:25.794
'cause I'm just out here
playing make-believe.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.089
Baby, I got a job.

26:29.130 --> 26:30.215
I know you don't know me,

26:30.256 --> 26:31.925
but that is
wildly out of character.

26:31.966 --> 26:34.427
I'm a energy broker now.

26:34.469 --> 26:35.553
And I don't know
what that is either,

26:35.595 --> 26:38.765
but I make 48,000 a year,
plus benefits.

26:38.807 --> 26:40.433
And I get
end-of-the-year bonuses,

26:40.475 --> 26:42.060
and we got a company retreat
in March.

26:42.102 --> 26:44.437
I get a polo with a logo on it.

26:44.479 --> 26:45.689
It is so fuckin' boring,

26:45.730 --> 26:48.775
but I'm so excited,
because being boring...

26:48.817 --> 26:50.026
means I might get
to be with you.

26:50.068 --> 26:53.905
[soft music]

26:53.947 --> 26:56.116
I know you'll never forgive
Dr. Todd.

26:56.157 --> 26:59.661
And you shouldn't. He's shady.

26:59.703 --> 27:03.498
But I was really hoping...

27:03.540 --> 27:07.002
girl, I'm praying
you give Isaiah a chance.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.298
- Man, fuck her.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.134
Boring-ass
realtor motherfucker.

27:14.175 --> 27:15.927
[knocking at door]
- Marty!

27:15.969 --> 27:19.264
[voices clamoring]
- And fuck that job, too.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.017
Firing you just 'cause
you not who you said you was.

27:22.058 --> 27:23.476
Who does that?

27:23.518 --> 27:25.145
- Marty!
[knocking]

27:25.186 --> 27:27.397
- Marty, you don't understand!
- Marty!

27:27.439 --> 27:29.149
- Go away, Troy!

27:29.190 --> 27:31.026
- Home Depot is not gonna stop.

27:31.067 --> 27:33.862
- Can we please just go
rob another bank, man?

27:33.903 --> 27:35.071
Come on!

27:35.113 --> 27:36.281
- Come on, Marty!
[shouting, knocking]

27:36.322 --> 27:38.283
- Rodney Lamonca
not gonna find us.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.243
[knocking]

27:40.285 --> 27:41.995
- Marty!
- Yeah, he is.

27:42.037 --> 27:43.163
- Come on, man!

27:43.204 --> 27:44.414
- Boy, you got
some big brass balls

27:44.456 --> 27:45.999
calling me out of the blue
like this!

27:46.041 --> 27:47.167
You know how much trouble
you caused me?

27:47.208 --> 27:48.835
- With the cops?
- No, with my wife.

27:48.877 --> 27:51.629
Ever since Katrina found out
that her son was murdered,

27:51.671 --> 27:52.922
she's been a total buzzkill.

27:52.964 --> 27:54.049
She stopped
whitening her teeth.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.675
She let her fillers go to shit.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.011
It's like being married
to a fuckin' jack-o'-lantern.

27:58.053 --> 27:59.763
I don't even enjoy
cheating on her anymore

27:59.804 --> 28:01.848
because she deserves it!

28:01.890 --> 28:03.933
So here's what I'm gonna do.

28:03.975 --> 28:05.435
I'm gonna shoot you
in the fuckin' head.

28:05.477 --> 28:07.312
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
before you do that,

28:07.354 --> 28:08.646
you might wanna hear me out.

28:08.688 --> 28:11.024
- Oh, yeah? Why is that?

28:11.066 --> 28:13.693
- 'Cause I'm about to make you
$20 million.

28:13.735 --> 28:16.404
- [scoffs]
Go on.

28:16.446 --> 28:18.698
- Three words:

28:18.740 --> 28:22.118
Saw palmetto berries.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.995
- What the fuck?

28:24.037 --> 28:25.705
You gave him my idea?
- Oh, it's perfect!

28:25.747 --> 28:27.040
I love my Domininers.

28:27.082 --> 28:28.958
They're driven. They're hungry.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.044
They're gonna change
the fuckin' world.

28:31.086 --> 28:33.713
But these are
some pencil dick cum-dribblers.

28:33.755 --> 28:36.383
If they weren't, they wouldn't
be spending 4,000 bucks

28:36.424 --> 28:38.510
to watch Tyrese tell 'em
that God has a plan.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.762
- And most of these dudes
have prostate problems, bro.

28:40.804 --> 28:43.306
We about to make bank.

28:43.348 --> 28:46.476
- Okay, but it's not gonna be
easy for you.

28:46.518 --> 28:48.520
It took us a year
to get to this point.

28:48.561 --> 28:51.690
And there's hardly
any swampland left.

28:51.731 --> 28:54.401
- So, yeah, about that.

28:54.442 --> 28:56.236
Remember when I called you
last week?

28:56.277 --> 28:58.363
Shit, what'd you do?
Your hands are clean.

28:58.405 --> 29:00.407
- Not that clean.
I burned down the putt-putt.

29:00.448 --> 29:02.117
- They never proved that.
- Lied to cops.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.535
- Good. Cops suck.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.161
- Dragged that kid's body
to the swamp.

29:05.203 --> 29:06.746
- White boy with cornrows.
He had it coming.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.832
- Fed it to a snake.
- That was awesome.

29:08.873 --> 29:10.083
- Brock got shot 'cause of me.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.418
- I don't even know
who Brock is.

29:11.459 --> 29:12.836
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:12.877 --> 29:13.920
You were recording me?
- Yep.

29:13.962 --> 29:15.422
And we got you on tape

29:15.463 --> 29:17.674
confessing to the murder
of my wife's son.

29:17.716 --> 29:18.967
- Could just say your son.

29:19.009 --> 29:20.385
- He had none of my blood!
Shut up!

29:20.427 --> 29:21.970
- So here's
what's gonna happen.

29:22.012 --> 29:24.764
You're gonna sign the farm over
to the Dominine Corporation.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.391
And if you don't,

29:26.433 --> 29:28.601
we're gonna play that tape
for the police.

29:28.643 --> 29:30.186
Come on, bruh.

29:30.228 --> 29:32.647
You don't want Vanessa to have
to visit her daddy in prison.

29:32.689 --> 29:35.650
[dramatic music]

29:35.692 --> 29:38.611
* *

29:38.653 --> 29:40.405
- Marty Simkowitz?

29:40.447 --> 29:43.366
I'm from KB Debt
Consolidation Network.

29:43.408 --> 29:47.912
You owe $8,000
to Ashley Furniture.

29:47.954 --> 29:50.915
- Fuckin' Ashley Furniture,
Marty?

29:50.957 --> 29:53.168
- * Ain't nobody dope as me *
