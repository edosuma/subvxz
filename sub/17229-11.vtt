20:12.545 --> 20:14.146
TWICE AS HARD?

20:14.146 --> 20:15.247
YES.

20:15.247 --> 20:17.316
SO I CAN BE
TWICE AS GOOD.

20:17.316 --> 20:20.019
OR ELSE SOMEBODY GETS IT.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.122
WE'LL WORK ON THAT.

20:29.995 --> 20:31.030
Cristela:
ARE YOU READY?
YES.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.431
AND I'M NOT GONNA MAKE FUN
OF YOU

20:32.431 --> 20:33.632
BECAUSE
I LEARNED MY LESSON.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.035
PROMISE?

20:36.035 --> 20:38.170
CROSS MY HEART.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.150
GOOD.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.321
SO, THIS IS THE PART
OF THE MUSICAL

20:55.321 --> 20:56.756
WHERE PRINCESS LEIA

20:56.756 --> 21:00.392
HAS JUST PUT
THE DEATH STAR PLANS INTO R2-D2.

21:02.328 --> 21:04.363
[ STRUMS DISCORDANTLY ]

21:07.733 --> 21:09.034
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

21:09.034 --> 21:11.036
I PROMISED
I WOULDN'T MAKE FUN OF YOU.

21:11.036 --> 21:13.105
AND THE ONLY WAY
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

21:13.105 --> 21:15.474
[Chuckling]
IS IF I LEAVE RIGHT NOW.
