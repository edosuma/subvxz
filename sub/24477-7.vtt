WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:02.736
The final season of New Girl

00:02.770 --> 00:04.905
celebrates friends to the end.

00:04.938 --> 00:06.807
I'm gonna go open
a bottle of wine.
Pink okay?

00:06.840 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.478
And check out
our other Fox shows--

00:10.511 --> 00:12.713
LA to Vegas, Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:12.746 --> 00:14.582
-and The Last Man on Earth.
-(laughs)

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.887
And so,
beautiful monkey cracker.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.855
Monkey cracker boyfriend.

00:21.889 --> 00:24.024
In Russia,
we would strap you to goat

00:24.058 --> 00:26.227
-and see if you live.
-(chuckles)

00:26.260 --> 00:27.928
And if you don't live,
we eat the goat.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.531
May you die together.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.266
-(cheering)
-Well, that was wonderful.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.435
-Did someone ask her to speak?
-CECE: Okay.

00:34.468 --> 00:37.571
Up next, Nick's two best men:

00:37.605 --> 00:38.572
my husband

00:38.606 --> 00:39.773
and Winston Bishop.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.041
-(cheering)
-SCHMIDT: Okay.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.577
Oh, this is gonna be trouble.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.579
Good. Okay, so, uh,
Nick and Jess

00:45.613 --> 00:47.781
asked the two of us
to make a toast

00:47.815 --> 00:49.750
-the night before their wedding.
-But Schmidty and Winnie

00:49.783 --> 00:51.185
don't roll like that.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.521
-Uh-oh.
-So why toast...

00:53.554 --> 00:55.456
BOTH:
When we can roast?

00:55.489 --> 00:57.625
This is about to be
really funny.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.427
Okay, let's start with Nick.
Now, I don't want to say

00:59.460 --> 01:02.130
Nick here is a lazy piece
of human garbage

01:02.163 --> 01:04.798
with a flat ass
and the writing talents

01:04.832 --> 01:07.067
-of a brain-dead alcoholic.
-(laughs)

01:07.101 --> 01:09.537
Because why state the obvious?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.205
(Schmidt and Winston laughing)

01:11.239 --> 01:12.573
Oh, my God.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.041
-Oh.
-But in a real way,

01:14.074 --> 01:16.076
Nick sucks as a person, y'all.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.778
-SCHMIDT: That's right.
-WINSTON: He really does.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.947
But more importantly,
his writing...

01:19.980 --> 01:21.749
-also sucks!
-(laughs)

01:21.782 --> 01:23.151
You know what they say:

01:23.184 --> 01:24.718
you put a thousand monkeys

01:24.752 --> 01:26.487
in front
of a thousand typewriters...

01:26.520 --> 01:28.389
One of them will be Nick,
and he'll probably

01:28.422 --> 01:29.923
be writing
The Pepperwood Chronicles.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.160
(laughs) That's a dumb-ass book.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.327
Maybe this is our fault.
We threw

01:33.361 --> 01:34.828
this wedding together so fast.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.264
And you did tell 'em to go hard.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.166
I did actually tell them
to go "hawd"

01:38.199 --> 01:39.667
and to not get "scurred,"

01:39.700 --> 01:42.069
so th-that's where
the confusion might be.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.471
-And that brings us to Jess.
-Okay.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.573
Beautiful, big-eyed Jess

01:45.606 --> 01:47.508
who could have had
any man she wanted

01:47.541 --> 01:48.842
in the whole wide world.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.245
-And still can.
-And still can.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.281
-She still can.
-Run!

01:53.314 --> 01:55.849
-WINSTON: Get your ass out.
He ain't no good. -SCHMIDT: Run!

01:55.883 --> 01:57.818
-Do you think this is funny?
-No. -He's gonna drag you down!

01:57.851 --> 01:59.587
-That's a loser! Run! -Yep.
And he's a piece of doo-doo

01:59.620 --> 02:02.190
on top of it-- he won't pleasure
you, just himself.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.991
Do I really have to sleep
at Schmidt's house tonight?

02:04.024 --> 02:05.926
-He wants to do facials.
-SCHMIDT: Run!

02:05.959 --> 02:07.261
I feel like that's not
what I think it means,

02:07.295 --> 02:08.596
but I still don't want to do it.

02:08.629 --> 02:09.930
Well, it is tradition
to sleep apart

02:09.963 --> 02:10.998
the night before the wedding.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.966
So, what does, uh, tradition say

02:13.000 --> 02:14.134
about hand stuff?

02:14.168 --> 02:15.469
I'll have to check the book.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.338
-Okay.
-WINSTON: That's Nick Miller.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.673
-What book?
-SCHMIDT: Thank you.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.709
-Okay. (laughs)
-Right there.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.677
-For real, though.
-Okay.

02:23.711 --> 02:24.978
Have a lovely evening,
you guys. Okay.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.013
-That was good, right?
-Yep.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.652
-God, Mom!
-I wasn't touching it.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.120
You shouldn't have slept
together

02:33.153 --> 02:35.223
the night before your wedding.
It is bad luck.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.991
-Oh. -Mom, that's just
a stupid superstition.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.294
Oh, it is so not.
Your Uncle Elmer slept

02:40.328 --> 02:42.029
with your Aunt Jeanie
the night before their wedding.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.531
And they've been married
40 years.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.200
But he's gay.
You're playing with fire.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.468
-This marriage could be cursed.
-Well, if the curse means

02:47.501 --> 02:48.869
spending the rest of my life

02:48.902 --> 02:50.404
with the woman I love,
then I say

02:50.438 --> 02:51.505
-bring it on.
-Oh, grow up.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.806
-I love you.
-Love you, too.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.842
-Also, your wang is out.
-It is?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.210
(sighs)

02:56.244 --> 02:57.545
JESS:
* I'm getting married *

02:57.578 --> 02:59.079
* In the morning *

02:59.112 --> 03:01.649
* Even though
it's later in the day *

03:01.682 --> 03:03.351
* Am I nervous? Maybe *

03:03.384 --> 03:05.486
* Damn, I forgot
to invite Sadie *

03:05.519 --> 03:08.088
* Who knew my Uncle Elmer
was gay? *

03:08.121 --> 03:10.023
Hey, Jess, I'm gonna take Mario

03:10.057 --> 03:11.925
for a little walk.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.327
I'll see you on the other side
of the aisle.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.562
I'd ask you for a kiss,

03:14.595 --> 03:15.929
but I don't want to mess
with the curse.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.565
Well, that curse
can kiss my ass,

03:17.598 --> 03:19.733
and you can kiss my face.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.168
That's very funny,
but the swearing

03:21.201 --> 03:22.403
will end when we're married.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.105
-All right. Love you.
-Love you.

03:26.474 --> 03:27.541
Have fun.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.611
(screams)

03:30.644 --> 03:32.246
(toy squeaks)

03:32.280 --> 03:34.282
*

03:36.083 --> 03:37.718
Honey, you are as beautiful

03:37.751 --> 03:39.687
as the day you slid out of me.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.189
No one is gonna be able
to take their eyes off you.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.691
You're a vision.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.192
Really?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.094
I don't look
like a pirate bride?

03:47.127 --> 03:49.096
-No. -No way.
-Never. Mm-mm.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.431
Why are we lying to her?

03:50.464 --> 03:51.932
Not now, Ruth. (clears throat)

03:51.965 --> 03:53.133
Idea.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.968
Once I am finished
with your hair,

03:55.002 --> 03:56.704
-no one's gonna notice
anyway, okay? -Oh!

03:56.737 --> 03:58.238
Nothing that covers
my shoulders.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.308
I want to make sure I leave room
for the parrot.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.310
It's the curse. I told you.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.911
She slipped in the shower
and scratched her cornea

04:03.944 --> 04:05.646
on a dog toy.
That could happen to anyone.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.714
ALY:
Hey.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.915
People on one side of the aisle

04:07.948 --> 04:08.982
won't even notice.

04:09.016 --> 04:12.052
-Oh.
-Is it that bad?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.053
I just want to check it out.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.322
-It's fine-- oh.
-Can I look at it?

04:14.355 --> 04:17.057
Oh, God, I look like
a prostitute

04:17.090 --> 04:19.927
from an Old West movie
that everybody calls Winks.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.762
Oh, my gosh, I actually arrested

04:21.795 --> 04:22.930
a prostitute named Winks once.

04:22.963 --> 04:23.964
Was she pretty?

04:23.997 --> 04:25.232
She was a good person,

04:25.265 --> 04:27.100
but she had her demons,
like we all do.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.302
We don't need to talk
about Winks.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.637
Ah... Excuse me.

04:29.670 --> 04:33.073
Mom, what if it is the curse?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.675
What if I cursed
my future with Nick?

04:34.708 --> 04:36.677
What if it's all
downhill from here?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.846
It's not real, okay, do not
let that get into your head.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.681
-Sweetheart, this wedding is
a wash. -Oh, my God.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.949
You'll get it right
the next time.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.384
-Joan...
-Cece.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.120
(indistinct conversations)

04:47.154 --> 04:48.689
NICK:
Tran!

04:48.722 --> 04:50.591
Look at you.
You look so good,

04:50.624 --> 04:52.360
you heartthrob.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.927
Hey, did you ever think
Jess was gonna want

04:53.961 --> 04:56.497
to marry me?
You did?

04:56.530 --> 04:58.165
Ah, see, I didn't see that.
I just feel like

04:58.198 --> 05:00.334
the luckiest guy
in the whole world.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.604
That's a very sweet thing
to say.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.373
Hey, I'm feeling
a little bit antsy.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.708
What's a groom supposed to do
on his wedding day?

05:07.741 --> 05:12.279
I said day, not night,
you little pervert.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.348
(laughing): I know what to do
in the night.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.116
Oh, my publisher just showed up.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.518
I want to see what he thinks
about my new book.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.152
I'm not gonna give him
your poems.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.722
I'm not gonna do it.
I gave you my opinion on 'em.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.491
There was some racist stuff
in there that I didn't dig,

05:23.524 --> 05:24.992
and I don't want my name
associated.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.761
I'll give him your poems.
(laughing)

05:29.196 --> 05:31.532
There he is,
father of the bride.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.334
-I've been told to keep you to
three drinks, sir. -Very cute.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.204
Almost as cute as the toast
that you gave last night.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.507
Let me ask you something
as a fan.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.476
When you rhymed Nick's name
with a certain body part,

05:42.510 --> 05:44.044
how did you come up with that?

05:44.077 --> 05:45.646
I mean, because,
come on, brilliant.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.647
Thank you very much
for saying that, it means...

05:46.680 --> 05:47.881
He's being sarcastic.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.883
Oh, so now you can read
the room.

05:49.917 --> 05:50.884
What the hell are you
talking about?

05:50.918 --> 05:52.019
We killed it last night.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.021
Yeah, I explained every joke

05:54.054 --> 05:55.389
-right after I told it.
-Yeah.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.391
You stunk, like a...

05:57.425 --> 05:59.893
a big wheel
of Limburger cheese.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.161
Now, that's comedy.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.730
Stay away from me.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.100
Nick, I gotta tell you,
Chicago Hobo is

06:07.134 --> 06:09.202
-some of your best writing.
-You really liked it?

06:09.236 --> 06:11.071
-Oh, I loved it.
-What a relief.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.740
I had no idea you had
such a difficult childhood.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.342
I mean, you've seen
a lot of dead dogs.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.210
-313.
-Ah.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.112
-So, when are we publishing
this? -Oh, no, no, we're not.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.748
Uh, it's too dark
for the tween market.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.283
I-I thought you said you re...
you really l-liked...

06:23.316 --> 06:24.952
We can sign you up
for three more Pepperwoods.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.353
I feel like I'm done
with Pepperwood.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.088
That's a great, that's great,
that's great.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.757
-See, because he's Jewish...
-Okay, yum, yum.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.892
Who's that bear over there?

06:33.126 --> 06:34.695
Don't answer.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.497
(wings flapping)

06:38.231 --> 06:39.733
(sighs)

06:39.767 --> 06:41.735
The curse?

06:41.769 --> 06:42.870
No.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.105
-Oh...
-Hey, I'm just,

06:45.138 --> 06:46.474
uh, looking for hairspray.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.576
What is going on with you?

06:48.609 --> 06:50.143
Nothing.
Where's Ruth?

06:50.177 --> 06:52.312
Oh, she's busy guarding
the bridal suite.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.281
No boys allowed.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.616
Get him, Mario!

06:55.649 --> 06:57.217
(whines)

06:57.250 --> 06:59.487
You sure you're okay?
Because you seem to be

06:59.520 --> 07:01.121
in some pain back there,

07:01.154 --> 07:03.657
like you were in,
I don't know, labor.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.825
What? No, my baby loves
being in here.

07:04.858 --> 07:05.893
You don't even know.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.661
-All right.
-(groans)

07:07.695 --> 07:09.296
I'm fine.
Get out of here.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.732
-All right.
-See ya.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.667
(Aly groans loudly)

07:13.701 --> 07:16.003
JOAN:
Jess, honey, it's happening.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.304
-What is?
-The curse!

07:17.337 --> 07:18.639
How often do you check
your mail?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.841
Mom, you know
your girl's paperless.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.677
-You're being evicted.
-What?!

07:23.711 --> 07:24.978
This is from the new
management company.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.580
I have to move out in 30 days.
Oh, no.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.616
Everything's going wrong.

07:28.649 --> 07:29.950
You were right.
I cursed us.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.852
-This is a disaster!
What do I do? -Shh, shh, shh.

07:31.885 --> 07:35.355
-What do I do? Mom!
-Shh, shh, shh. Sweetheart,

07:35.388 --> 07:37.925
I know just want you need.
How about

07:37.958 --> 07:41.094
you try to relax
with a little of the cheeba

07:41.128 --> 07:43.096
-from Aunt Reeba?
-What?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.932
-(whispering): Marijuana.
-It's my wedding day!

07:44.965 --> 07:47.267
-What? Did you bring that
on the plane? -Yes.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.137
-Mom! -Really, just take a small
toke. It's not that strong.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.405
It's so weak, they call it
Gun Control in America.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.875
CECE:
Hey, babe.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.309
I found the hairspray, and...

07:56.343 --> 07:58.278
Oh, my God,
you're in your dress.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.713
Babe, you look so beautiful.
I can't

07:59.747 --> 08:01.348
believe you're finally
getting married, and...

08:01.381 --> 08:04.552
-Cece!
-Hey!

08:04.585 --> 08:06.954
Oh, my God, I am so high.

08:06.987 --> 08:10.123
-(whispering): Come here. I have
something to tell you. -Mm-hmm.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.892
-Come here.
-Okay, I'm here. Uh-huh.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.594
Whatever you do,
don't tell Cece.

08:16.396 --> 08:19.199
-Mmm. -Oh, my God. Okay,
how much of your mom's stuff

08:19.232 --> 08:22.202
-did you smoke? -It is so mild.
Like, I don't even feel it.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.904
-Nothing, huh?
-If I look in your eyes,

08:23.937 --> 08:25.739
-can you taste what I'm tasting?
-Mm-hmm. Okay, we have

08:25.773 --> 08:28.175
-60 minutes till the wedding.
-No, look into my googly eye.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.510
-Uh, do I have to?
-Yeah.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.580
-You taste delicious
vanilla cake? -No.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.181
-Damn it.
-Okay, here's the plan.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.684
I am going to fix your makeup,

08:36.717 --> 08:38.518
-and then we ride this thing
out. -Oh, I've got a plan.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.387
-What?
-Check this out.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.890
-This is gonna be good.
-What is happening?

08:42.923 --> 08:47.595
Or strap on a spare patch,
and Nick marries a sexy fly.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.197
(buzzing)

08:50.230 --> 08:52.165
I'm just gonna remove this.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.767
Okay, here we go.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.502
-I can see.
-Yes, yeah.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.038
-Mm-hmm.
-So the upside to this is,

08:58.071 --> 09:00.540
at least
you are not freaking out

09:00.574 --> 09:02.710
-about your wedding
being cursed. -Yeah.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.544
-That's a bonus.
-Oh, Cece, question.

09:04.578 --> 09:07.180
-Uh-huh. -At what size
does a cup become a bucket?

09:07.214 --> 09:09.382
-Uh...
-Jess. -Russell!

09:09.416 --> 09:11.384
How the hell are you?

09:11.418 --> 09:13.186
Good. You, look, um... Gosh.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.521
Mmm, did you have some cake yet?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.690
Uh, tons of it at my house,
but that's my issue.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.558
Look, I really need
to talk with you, Jess.

09:18.592 --> 09:19.960
-Okay.
-(Aly groaning loudly)

09:19.993 --> 09:21.695
Did I make that sound
with my mind?

09:21.729 --> 09:23.096
-CECE: You okay, Aly?
-Mm-hmm, I'm fine.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.132
I just swallowed a wasp,
and it stung me

09:25.165 --> 09:26.967
inside of my throat
a bunch of times.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.036
I don't see what the big deal
is. Please stay away from me!

09:29.069 --> 09:30.771
Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna

09:30.804 --> 09:32.740
go after that girl right there.
Russell, could you please

09:32.773 --> 09:35.075
keep an eye on Jess?
Don't let her out of your sight.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.044
-Yeah, yeah. -Thank you
very much. Appreciate it.

09:37.077 --> 09:41.782
Uh, Jess, you're, um...
your right eye's kind of stuck.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.984
(singsongy):
Not if I do this.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.252
Much better now.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.488
Hey, so, um,
we think we may have

09:48.521 --> 09:50.290
done a bad job with your toast.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.391
SCHMIDT:
Uh, it's Winston's fault.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.592
What? No.
It is entirely

09:52.626 --> 09:53.794
-Schmidt's fault.
-This is not a funny man.

09:53.827 --> 09:54.995
Doesn't matter.
Look, we want

09:55.028 --> 09:56.730
to make it up to you,
so if there's anything

09:56.764 --> 09:59.132
that we can do,
please just l-let us know.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.334
-Our marriage is cursed.
-Wh-What do you mean, cursed?

10:01.368 --> 10:03.637
Last night I seduced Jess
at the, uh, rehearsal dinner.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.438
I dangled my hot body
in front of her,

10:05.472 --> 10:07.240
and she couldn't resist,

10:07.274 --> 10:08.642
and we had a night
of weird, wild sex

10:08.676 --> 10:10.010
that would have made
the good Lord proud,

10:10.043 --> 10:11.478
and now our marriage is cursed.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.080
Come on, man.
None of that stuff is true.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.581
Curses aren't real.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.149
Yeah, but you believe
in crystals, Winston.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.852
Crystals are real, dude. Don't
say nothing bad about crystals!

10:18.886 --> 10:20.988
Merle said he's not publishing
Chicago Hobo,

10:21.021 --> 10:22.690
-and then a bird pooed on me.
-SCHMIDT: What do you mean,

10:22.723 --> 10:24.858
he won't publish it? -Where's
the bird? I'll poo on him.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.960
Those two things happened
back-to-back. That's a curse.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.262
Stop being such a goy boy.
You go find Merle,

10:29.296 --> 10:31.665
and you tell him that you are
not writing another Pepperwood

10:31.699 --> 10:33.466
until he publishes Chicago Hobo.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.869
-You think it'll work?
-I know so, okay?

10:35.903 --> 10:37.537
He's right over there.
We believe in you.

10:37.570 --> 10:40.040
-You can do this. -I'm gonna
do this. I'm gonna do it well.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.608
-Hell, yeah.
-That's right.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.477
-(whoops)
-Well, guess we fixed the toast.

10:44.511 --> 10:45.846
(indistinct chatter)

10:45.879 --> 10:47.715
Look at our boy, all grown up.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.216
Little disappointed
about what we talked about.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.151
You know, you and I--
we make a good combination.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.552
-Winston and Schmidt.
-Mm-hmm.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.987
-I set 'em up, you...
-And I set 'em up.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.488
All right.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.125
It looked good, man.
How'd it go?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.827
Good, good, good.
He told me to go to hell

10:59.860 --> 11:01.228
and that he's not gonna publish
Pepperwood anymore,

11:01.261 --> 11:03.630
-and I basically
lost my job, so... -Mm.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.631
(slurps)

11:04.664 --> 11:06.133
Uh...

11:06.166 --> 11:08.736
Curses are real, people!

11:08.769 --> 11:10.237
They are real!

11:10.270 --> 11:12.239
I got to go protect my bride.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.340
WOMAN:
This is the oddest wedding.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.542
(groaning loudly)
Oh, hey, Cece.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.577
Oh, I'm so mad about politics.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.046
Aah!

11:19.079 --> 11:21.314
Aly, you are having the baby,
okay?

11:21.348 --> 11:22.983
-I know those labor eyes,
sister. -Okay, fine.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.684
-I'm in labor.
-I know!

11:24.718 --> 11:27.320
Why is this how we make more
people? It's a terrible system.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.822
Oh, honey, we got
to get Winston,

11:28.856 --> 11:30.257
-we got to get you
to the hospital. -No, no, no.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.159
I don't want to go
until after the wedding. Aah!

11:32.192 --> 11:33.894
Take me to drugs.
Take me to drugs right now.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.328
There we go.
All right, here we go.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.497
I don't want to scare you,
but this is the easy part.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.233
-You feeling better?
-Yeah, yeah.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.935
The fresh air's really helping.

11:41.969 --> 11:44.004
We're in a stairwell.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.705
Ugh. You must think
I'm the worst

11:45.739 --> 11:47.741
for going elbow deep
in the ganj.

11:47.775 --> 11:50.343
Nah. In fact,
I was high for, well,

11:50.377 --> 11:52.780
all my weddings. Whatever
gets you down the aisle.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.347
Well, I seduced Nick last night.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.116
I lured him
into my bridal chambers,

11:56.149 --> 11:57.885
and now we're getting evicted,

11:57.918 --> 12:01.521
my eye looks like ground beef,
and I cursed our marriage.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.423
-You believe in curses?
-Not normally,

12:03.456 --> 12:06.593
but I just want to know
that Nick and I are safe,

12:06.626 --> 12:09.262
and no cartoon anvil's gonna
fall out of the sky

12:09.296 --> 12:10.697
and crush us to smithereens.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.599
Is that crazy?

12:12.632 --> 12:16.403
No, but maybe it's not signs
and curses you're worried about.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.939
Maybe it's the relationship?

12:18.972 --> 12:20.941
I mean, maybe, deep down,
you know

12:20.974 --> 12:22.910
you and Nick aren't right
for each other.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.045
Wait, what?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.446
What are you running from?

12:26.479 --> 12:29.116
Here I am, sitting with an
amazing, beautiful, smart woman

12:29.149 --> 12:32.085
on her wedding day, and she's
stoned and wearing an eye patch,

12:32.119 --> 12:34.387
and sitting
in a dank stairwell with her ex.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.424
You want to talk about signs,
that's a sign.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.425
A sign of what?

12:38.458 --> 12:39.492
Don't marry Nick.

12:39.526 --> 12:40.593
Be with me.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.062
Jess.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.231
I love you.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.033
Oh, boy.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.403
Ooh, hey, honey.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.005
Hey, Ruth, is Aunt Jess here?

12:52.039 --> 12:54.474
-I really need to talk to her.
-What's the password?

12:54.507 --> 12:56.176
WINSTON: Oh, the password.
Oh, uh, yeah, it's...

12:56.209 --> 12:57.577
-Ruth 1.
-Wrong.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.012
-Ruth 2?
-Wrong.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.780
-Ruth 3...?
-Wrong.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.282
-Don't do this to me, kid.
-Wrong.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.517
Ruth, honey, just tell us
where Aunt Jess is, okay?

13:04.551 --> 13:06.586
Sure, for a hundred bucks.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.921
-I ain't got that. -I've never
been more proud of that--

13:07.955 --> 13:09.089
I mean, this is my daughter.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.024
-Unbelievable. -Yeah.
-Ruth.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.792
Man to man,

13:12.826 --> 13:13.927
I need to talk to Jess.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.495
I need to know if she's okay.

13:15.528 --> 13:16.930
But they're not back there.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.598
They're on the stairs.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.433
-Who's "they"?
-RUSSELL: Look.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.634
When you first started working,
I thought I was gonna

13:21.668 --> 13:23.036
be fine, I was over it, and then

13:23.070 --> 13:24.137
the more time
we spent with each other,

13:24.171 --> 13:25.638
it just all came rushing back.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.540
And you're choosing
to tell me this now?

13:27.574 --> 13:29.176
We've been together
literally every day

13:29.209 --> 13:31.044
-for the past week and a half.
-Yeah.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.146
I shouldn't be telling you
any of this, but I also know

13:33.180 --> 13:36.216
-that if I didn't,
I'd regret it forever. -Russell,

13:36.249 --> 13:37.717
I am in love with Nick,
100%, okay?

13:37.750 --> 13:40.687
This is not puppy love.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.489
This is old-ass dog love.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.157
Do you remember
your first date with Nick?

13:44.191 --> 13:46.159
You ran into me-- sign--

13:46.193 --> 13:48.661
and I asked you both
to write down what you meant

13:48.695 --> 13:51.331
to each other on the back
of some valet ticket.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.001
You kept those?

13:54.034 --> 13:57.170
I think you should look at those
before you get married.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.573
Neither of you were ever sure
about this, not really.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.242
Not deep down.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.712
Jess, be with me. Let me
give you the life you deserve.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.380
-Let me make you happy.
-(door opens)

14:07.414 --> 14:09.482
-Let me make you dead,
you son of a bitch! -Oh, Nick!

14:09.516 --> 14:11.584
-(shouts)
-Oh! No! (shouts)

14:11.618 --> 14:13.553
(shouting)

14:13.586 --> 14:15.155
NICK:
I'm gonna get you...

14:15.188 --> 14:16.656
WINSTON: What you think
you're doing, Russell, huh?

14:16.689 --> 14:18.558
Don't you have enough wives,
you slut?

14:18.591 --> 14:20.860
-I'm winning, I'm winning,
I'm winning! -Take that!

14:20.894 --> 14:23.363
I'm losing, I'm losing-- he's so
slippery! He's like a dolphin!

14:23.396 --> 14:24.932
Wow, Jess.

14:24.965 --> 14:28.401
That dress.
You look so beautiful.

14:28.435 --> 14:29.903
-Thank you. -But your eye.
What happened to your eye?

14:29.937 --> 14:32.372
-No... -Oh. -Did this son
of a bitch steal your eye?!

14:32.405 --> 14:35.375
-I'll kill you! -No, no,
I hurt my eye, and then my mom

14:35.408 --> 14:38.078
gave me some
of that sweet Portland bomb-a.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.848
Look, Nick, I love you.
I have no feelings for Russell.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.250
But how could you not?
He is so handsome!

14:43.283 --> 14:45.852
I mean, look at him!
He's physically outstanding!

14:45.885 --> 14:47.354
And it's all my fault!

14:47.387 --> 14:48.688
Because I brought
the curse on us!

14:48.721 --> 14:51.291
Did the curse make you
more handsome?!

14:51.324 --> 14:52.725
-Yeah.
-That's my question to you!

14:52.759 --> 14:54.962
-He is physically incredible!
-Nick,

14:54.995 --> 14:56.964
please don't fight him.
We both know you're gonna lose.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.565
-Let's do this! -Let's do this!
-SCHMIDT: I got your back, man!

14:58.598 --> 15:01.368
-Let's do it! -Yeah,
unlucky for you, I'm packin'.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.369
RUSSELL: Oh, yeah?
I can take all three of you.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.537
I kick. I kick really high!

15:04.571 --> 15:05.939
You're all so bad at fighting!

15:05.973 --> 15:07.107
-Boys, what's the strategy?
-We hit him,

15:07.140 --> 15:08.775
-then we hit his ass again!
-Uh-oh,

15:08.808 --> 15:11.644
-I think he heard your strategy.
-Nick, take your clothes off.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.446
-What?! Why?!
-I just got your suit pressed.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.549
-Time-out. -Time. Time.
-Guys, guys, guys, guys,

15:16.583 --> 15:18.418
-Aly is in labor.
-What? My baby's having my baby?

15:18.451 --> 15:20.487
My baby's having my baby! Are
you okay? I love you so much.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.255
What if it comes out
covered in all the gum

15:22.289 --> 15:24.457
-I've ever swallowed?
-Baby, you'll be fine.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.593
-I'll call the doula.
-The doula's at Lollapalooza.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.262
Please tell me one of you goons
is sober enough to drive this

15:29.296 --> 15:31.431
-circus to the hospital. -Not
me. I've been drinking all day.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.765
I only have one working eye!

15:32.799 --> 15:33.900
Well, I'll take you
to the hospital.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.768
-Thank you. Thank you so much.
-CECE: Great!

15:35.802 --> 15:37.570
Uh, we'll beat you up
after the baby is born.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.938
Why would you say that?

15:38.972 --> 15:41.774
Babe, why is your crystal out?
Were you fighting?

15:41.808 --> 15:42.976
Aly, Winston, you come with me.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.344
-(elevator bell dings)
-Wait,

15:44.377 --> 15:46.513
everybody come.
I forgot who we're dealing with.

15:46.546 --> 15:51.018
-(tires screech) -Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, only Blaze drives the limo!

15:51.051 --> 15:52.252
(car horn honks)

15:52.285 --> 15:54.988
Damn, they said,
"Blaze, you gonna lose it."

15:55.022 --> 15:57.957
And I was like,
"Nah, it's too big." (chuckles)

16:03.730 --> 16:06.433
-Ooh. -Are you holding it in?
You got to hold it in.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.467
Don't want it to fall
on the ground and get dirty.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.369
That's not how it works.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.438
I'm really nervous
about what you don't know.

16:11.471 --> 16:15.475
Hey, are we positive that this
hospital has a baby department?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.444
-I think so.
-I hope so.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.013
Ooh, Dr. Silverstein.
Good to see you.

16:20.047 --> 16:23.183
(indistinct chatter)

16:23.216 --> 16:25.218
Hey, Russell. Catch.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.488
Your sixth wife
is out there somewhere.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.157
It's just not me.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.991
Good-bye, Jess.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.893
Good-bye, Russell.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.695
Hey, do the right thing

16:35.728 --> 16:37.997
and get us the most expensive
thing on the registry.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.433
(chuckles)

16:44.271 --> 16:45.772
Drive.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.642
Sorry about your hand.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.645
-(groans)
-At least we're in a hospital.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.547
-Does it hurt?
-Definitely.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.649
-Russell is shockingly strong.
-Yeah.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.585
Especially for a boy his age.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.087
I guess the curse is real.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.254
Yeah, we got evicted.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.656
A bird deuced on my shoulder.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.492
I say this with love,
but your eye is trash.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.194
Merle went crazy
and decided that a book

17:07.227 --> 17:10.063
about a hobo with electric
ankles wasn't a home run.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.599
And now I'm out of a job.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.734
We don't have a home.
I mean, we're cursed.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.070
-(laughs) It's kind of
our thing. -Yeah, it is.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.438
I mean, even the first time
I kissed you,

17:18.471 --> 17:20.440
you know, you were still dating
Dr. Sam.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.909
And now here we are
in a hospital waiting room,

17:22.942 --> 17:24.677
three miles away
from our wedding.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.814
-Figures. Sounds like us.
-Yeah.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.385
Hey, do you remember

17:32.419 --> 17:34.387
on our first date we wrote
how we felt about each other

17:34.421 --> 17:35.555
on two valet tickets?

17:35.588 --> 17:38.458
Ah, Jess, I'm sorry.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.393
I was just scared to tell you
how I really felt.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.629
I was scared, too. We've both
been scared about so many things

17:42.662 --> 17:44.764
for so long, and you know what?

17:44.797 --> 17:46.899
I don't care about the past
or the future.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.301
All that I care about

17:48.335 --> 17:51.604
is right now, right here,
you and me.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.240
I just want to have

17:53.273 --> 17:56.143
a weird,
wonderful life together.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.410
You know?
I want to get married

17:57.444 --> 18:00.480
and I want to take care of you,

18:00.513 --> 18:03.116
and I don't even care
about a stupid curse.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.984
Guys, guess what.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.486
-Oh, my God.
-Is the baby here?

18:06.519 --> 18:08.155
No, Aly's only
three centimeters.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.589
It's gonna be another 13 hours.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.325
Yeah, the doctor told me to run
around and burn off some energy.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.893
I was not being helpful.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.996
I'm excited!
(laughs)

18:17.029 --> 18:18.798
-Wait, where are you going?
-WINSTON: Huh?

18:18.831 --> 18:21.501
-It's that way.
-It's over here. Okay.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.670
-Wrong room.
-Wrong room.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.172
-Aah, aah!
-Nope, nope.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.773
Nope, nope. Back over here.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.408
Oh! I just came from here.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.642
-Yeah, we know.
-That's where she is.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.010
Go in.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.346
(Winston whoops)

18:36.783 --> 18:39.352
Hey, Jess.
Do you want to have

18:39.386 --> 18:40.787
the weirdest wedding
of all time?

18:40.820 --> 18:43.122
To you?

18:43.156 --> 18:44.991
That's all I want, Miller.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.161
This is it.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.631
How do I look?

18:51.664 --> 18:54.000
Beautif...

18:57.637 --> 18:59.206
Beautiful.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.709
(Cece clucks tongue, sighs)

19:04.544 --> 19:06.346
Thanks for putting
this together.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.647
Of course.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.317
Oh, thanks for doing this,
Padre.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.519
You know, my day is
normally wall-to-wall death,

19:12.552 --> 19:15.388
but, uh, you said so many
wonderful things about this man,

19:15.422 --> 19:17.056
I couldn't help but say yes.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.526
I thought I was just a monkey
with a typewriter.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.061
Winston's fault.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.063
That was his fault, 100%.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.064
(whispering):
Thank you.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.200
Love you, man.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.035
You two seem like
a very happy couple.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.570
-Thank you.
-I'm not marrying him.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.405
I'm marrying a girl.

19:32.439 --> 19:33.906
-That's okay, too.
-Music.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.908

by Phil Collins playing)

19:46.118 --> 19:48.888
* When I'm feeling blue *

19:48.921 --> 19:51.991
* All I have to do *

19:52.024 --> 19:53.926
* Is take a look... *

19:53.960 --> 19:55.695
Can we hurry this along?

19:55.728 --> 19:57.530
We're three minutes
till the next contraction.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.232
Oh, no, I'm wearing white
to a wedding.

19:59.266 --> 20:03.102
* When you're close to me *

20:03.135 --> 20:06.506
* I can feel your heart beat *

20:06.539 --> 20:10.243
* I can hear you breathing *

20:10.277 --> 20:12.945
* Near my ear *

20:12.979 --> 20:16.949
* Wouldn't you agree? *

20:16.983 --> 20:18.285
* Baby, you and me *

20:18.318 --> 20:20.019
* Got a groovy... *

20:20.052 --> 20:23.923
Ooh. Take care
of our pirate bride.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.759
I'm very proud of you, son.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.395
I heard you fought like a coward

20:28.428 --> 20:29.429
-for my daughter today.
-(chuckles)

20:29.462 --> 20:31.130
Thanks.

20:31.163 --> 20:34.267
(whispering):
I love you.

20:34.301 --> 20:37.103
* Anything you want to... *

20:37.136 --> 20:39.138
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.473
We doing this, Jessica Day?

20:40.507 --> 20:42.442
We're doing this, Nick Miller.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.110
-It's about damn time.
-(Jess chuckles)

20:44.143 --> 20:45.545
CHAPLAIN: Friends,
we've been invited here today

20:45.578 --> 20:47.146
to share with Nick and Jess

20:47.179 --> 20:49.382
in a very important moment
in their lives.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.650
Jess, do you take Nick?

20:50.683 --> 20:51.884
JESS:
I do.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.386
CHAPLAIN:
Nick, do you take Jess?

20:53.420 --> 20:54.654
NICK:
I do.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.389
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.957
You may kiss the bride.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.593
Okay.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.963
-Oh, damn.
-Is it bad?

21:03.996 --> 21:06.299
-Mm.
-I've seen worse.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.134
I mean, literally
ten minutes ago.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.436
I think you'll be happy
if it's covered.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.170
(laughing):
Sure.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.308
It's you and me now.

21:21.948 --> 21:22.915
(whoops)

21:22.949 --> 21:25.818
(whooping and cheering)

21:25.852 --> 21:28.988
-Hey!
-Ah!

21:30.056 --> 21:31.824
(baby cooing)

21:31.858 --> 21:34.694
Everybody meet Dan Bill Bishop.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.363
Oh. Daniel William?

21:36.396 --> 21:38.197
Nah, Dan Bill.

21:38.230 --> 21:41.167
Uh, is Bill the middle name?

21:41.200 --> 21:43.703
Nah. Dan Bill. Dan Bill Bishop.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.037
Family name or...?

21:45.071 --> 21:46.105
-Nah, it's Dan Bill.
-Oh.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.173
Tell them you're kidding.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.808
I'm not kidding.
It's Dan Bill Bishop.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.477
-What? -I'm not joking.
It's Dan Bill Bishop.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.011
ALY:
We're gonna talk about this.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.980
WINSTON: You were sleeping.
I made an executive decision.
