00:00.834 --> 00:02.569
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Practice"...</i>

00:02.602 --> 00:04.104
Oh, are you okay?

00:04.137 --> 00:06.139
You might have something
called chorioamnionitis,

00:06.172 --> 00:08.542
an infection
of the amniotic fluid.

00:08.575 --> 00:10.310
I want to schedule
an amnio.

00:10.343 --> 00:13.313
Lab results are normal,
including the repeat CBC.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.581
Meaning...

00:14.615 --> 00:16.216
Go home.

00:16.248 --> 00:18.719
My husband
is Raymond Littlefield.

00:18.752 --> 00:22.088
He's been charged with
murdering my daughter.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.090
Your daughter,
so his stepdaughter.

00:24.124 --> 00:25.225
Yes.

00:25.258 --> 00:28.061
They claim
he had an affair with her.

00:28.094 --> 00:29.763
He didn't.

00:29.796 --> 00:32.064
We had run-ins
over discipline.

00:32.098 --> 00:35.536
It probably became a typical
father/daughter relationship.

00:35.569 --> 00:36.837
With the exception

00:36.870 --> 00:39.072
that she claimed
that you slept with her.

00:39.105 --> 00:41.708
She had a history
of lying, Mr. Donnell.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.611
I don't mean
to be offensive, but...

00:44.645 --> 00:46.112
What?

00:46.146 --> 00:50.416
Did the police ever
consider you a suspect?

00:50.450 --> 00:53.186
You're asking me
if I killed my own daughter.

00:53.219 --> 00:56.189
Are you accusing me
of murder, Mr. Berluti?

00:56.222 --> 00:58.491
I'm just interviewing
everybody who could

00:58.525 --> 01:01.394
conceivably have a grudge
against Raymond Littlefield.

01:01.427 --> 01:02.796
You two were lovers.

01:02.829 --> 01:05.265
If I were going to kill
somebody out of anger,

01:05.298 --> 01:06.667
wouldn't I have
chosen him?

01:06.700 --> 01:08.769
Who's your suspect?

01:08.802 --> 01:10.771
Have you looked
at his wife?

01:10.804 --> 01:12.172
What about your mother?

01:12.205 --> 01:13.607
What about her?

01:13.640 --> 01:15.275
Could you conceive
of her

01:15.308 --> 01:16.877
wanting to harm
your sister?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.245
My mother
loved my sister.

01:19.279 --> 01:20.881
She would never hurt her.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.549
There was
some contaminated blood

01:22.583 --> 01:24.150
on the victim
near the vagina.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.452
It was a trace of semen.

01:26.486 --> 01:29.623
It genetically matches
your client.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.725
I didn't kill her,
Mr. Donnell.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.694
How did that semen
get there, Raymond?

01:33.727 --> 01:37.297
Whatever else might have
happened between us,

01:37.330 --> 01:39.666
I did not kill her.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.416
Our own DNA tests
came back.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.353
It's your semen.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.726
It's got to be wrong.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.794
Is there any margin
for error here?

02:07.828 --> 02:09.895
The odds that it came
from somebody else

02:09.930 --> 02:11.832
are 17 million to 1.

02:11.865 --> 02:15.301
Going into a murder trial--
bad odds.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.203
It isn't mine.

02:17.237 --> 02:18.672
Raymond, you admit having
an affair with her.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.306
I keep telling you,

02:20.340 --> 02:23.577
I hadn't slept with her
for at least a week.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.478
How long can semen last?

02:25.512 --> 02:27.413
It can last.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.915
Even if she's taking baths?

02:28.949 --> 02:30.851
She was on the swim team,
for God's sake.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.619
She was in chlorine
every day.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.691
You hadn't slept with her
for more than a week?

02:37.724 --> 02:39.259
No.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.761
And she'd been swimming
every day.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.395
Yes.

02:42.428 --> 02:46.366
Could they have
planted it-- the police?

02:46.399 --> 02:48.268
How would they
even get it?

02:48.301 --> 02:50.804
This isn't blood we're
talking about. It's semen.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.940
But let's assume for a second
it could have been planted.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.743
Who had access
to your...

02:58.812 --> 03:00.581
prior to Fiona's death,

03:00.614 --> 03:04.585
when was the last time
you had sex with your wife?

03:04.618 --> 03:07.487
I'd have to think.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.956
A day or two before--
maybe three.

03:18.264 --> 03:20.233
Is it possible

03:20.266 --> 03:25.305
your wife planted
your semen on Fiona?

03:27.373 --> 03:30.410
Are you asking me

03:30.443 --> 03:34.715
if it's possible
Kate killed Fiona?

03:34.748 --> 03:36.817
Her own daughter.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.820
That's what I'm asking.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.891
â™ª (theme)

04:32.539 --> 04:35.475
You want to accuse her
in open court?

04:35.509 --> 04:36.677
We're desperate.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.311
The prosecution
is so confident,

04:38.344 --> 04:40.013
they're not even
offering murder two.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.748
They're not even
charging it.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.417
They're going all the way,
no parole,

04:44.450 --> 04:46.553
because they know
they've got you.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.754
We need something

04:47.788 --> 04:49.590
to manufacture
reasonable doubt.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.425
First of all...

04:52.458 --> 04:55.328
if my wife did this
and is framing me,

04:55.361 --> 04:57.531
why would she--

04:57.564 --> 05:00.000
She's been at my side
the whole time,

05:00.033 --> 05:02.068
participating
in my defense.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.370
Well, she could
just be playing her part

05:04.404 --> 05:06.472
so as not to draw suspicion
to herself.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.074
Or she could be
setting herself up

05:08.108 --> 05:09.810
as a witness
for the defense,

05:09.843 --> 05:11.712
only to bury you
once she gets up there.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.714
That's pretty conniving.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.448
We all know
she's smart enough,

05:15.481 --> 05:17.017
and if she killed
her own daughter,

05:17.050 --> 05:18.585
she is capable
of anything.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.390
So your plan is?

05:24.424 --> 05:26.893
We let her think
we think she's on our side,

05:26.927 --> 05:29.563
and then when she testifies,
we ambush her,

05:29.596 --> 05:31.565
and hope it
flusters her enough

05:31.598 --> 05:33.934
to make her look
at least possibly guilty.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.836
What if you're wrong?

05:35.869 --> 05:37.571
What if she's
completely innocent?

05:37.604 --> 05:38.939
If we're wrong,

05:38.972 --> 05:41.007
we still might cast
some suspicion on her.

05:41.041 --> 05:44.044
That at least gives us
a chance at reasonable doubt.

05:44.077 --> 05:47.948
JIMMY:
But, obviously,
for it to work,

05:47.981 --> 05:49.415
you can't tell her.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.552
It has to be
a surprise attack.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.892
There's a big hole
in your theory.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.927
Since this little
discovery,

06:00.961 --> 06:02.729
she won't even talk to me.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.098
She says
she won't testify for me.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.800
I'll get her there.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.569
And once you do,

06:08.602 --> 06:12.005
you accuse her
of being the killer?

06:12.038 --> 06:14.808
We call it plan "B."

06:18.912 --> 06:21.782
You're going to say
she made love to her husband

06:21.815 --> 06:24.785
to get a semen sample
to plant on her own daughter,

06:24.818 --> 06:25.786
who she killed.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.588
It's possible.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.789
Even if it is,

06:28.822 --> 06:29.890
no jury is going
to believe that.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.424
And there's
another problem.

06:31.457 --> 06:32.893
Her name is on that
retainer agreement.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.528
She signed it.
She could be a client.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.962
I consulted
outside ethics counsel.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.864
For the purpose
of this agreement,

06:37.898 --> 06:39.600
he's the client,
not her.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.201
We don't
have to protect her.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.869
Bobby, even if he didn't
kill her,

06:42.903 --> 06:44.204
he's still
a statutory rapist.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.706
Is this guy really worth

06:45.739 --> 06:47.073
putting our reputation
on the line?

06:47.107 --> 06:49.209
Our reputation is
that we will do anything

06:49.242 --> 06:51.444
within the bounds
of the law to win,

06:51.477 --> 06:53.547
and since when do I have to
convince you of this?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.081
Well, maybe since I'm worried
about making rent.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.983
Oh, please.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.552
I have to admit,

06:58.585 --> 07:00.621
this time, it seems
particularly disgusting.

07:00.654 --> 07:03.690
Wait a second.
This woman could be the killer.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.959
She had motive
and opportunity.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.761
How do we not
go after her?

07:07.794 --> 07:11.464
They're due here
in an hour--

07:11.497 --> 07:13.734
Kate and Jenny,
the other stepdaughter.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.869
Bec, I need for you
to talk to her.

07:15.902 --> 07:17.738
Why?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.506
Because she knows
something.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.874
Some bad blood between
her mother and Fiona.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.609
Something.
She wouldn't tell me what.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.477
I need you
to work it out of her.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.479
And remember,
you can't tip her off

07:26.513 --> 07:28.515
that we're going
after her mother.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.687
Read it and weep,
baby.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.622
Unreconcile
is not a word.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.591
The word
is irreconcilable.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.260
Unreconcile
is certainly a word.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.995
Look, I just get home
from the hospital.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.163
All I want to do--

07:43.196 --> 07:44.264
Do you want to play
or not?

07:44.297 --> 07:45.498
Not if you're going
to cheat.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.033
That's nice, Ellenor.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.136
I stay home to be with you
and you call me a cheat.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.738
No, Helen,
you stayed home

07:51.772 --> 07:52.939
ostensibly
to look after me,

07:52.973 --> 07:54.675
to make sure
that I stay calm,

07:54.708 --> 07:56.142
not to try and beat me
with nonexistent, made-up--

07:56.176 --> 07:57.878
It's a word.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.847
The word
is irreconcile.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.116
Unreconcile
would refer to accounting.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.151
Irreconcile,
as in irreconcilable,

08:05.185 --> 08:07.153
would refer
to our relationship

08:07.187 --> 08:08.655
at the present moment.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.301
Raymond tells me you two
aren't really speaking.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.303
Gee.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.806
He claims
he didn't kill her.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.541
And it wouldn't be at all
like him to lie,

08:27.574 --> 08:28.709
now, would it?

08:28.742 --> 08:30.544
Look, his trial
starts tomorrow.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.312
If his semen had not
been found on Fiona,

08:32.345 --> 08:34.548
you wouldn't believe
that he killed her, right?

08:34.581 --> 08:36.049
But it was.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.884
I realize that, but...

08:37.918 --> 08:39.785
I want you to testify.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.922
I need you to say,

08:41.955 --> 08:43.890
prior to that semen
being found,

08:43.924 --> 08:45.726
you didn't think that he was
capable of violence.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.993
What good
would that do him

08:47.027 --> 08:48.662
if I now think
he's guilty?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.263
It speaks
to his character,

08:50.296 --> 08:52.198
and it'll help me some,
and I need whatever--

08:52.232 --> 08:54.668
I don't want
to help him.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.872
Kate, when you first came in
to hire me,

08:58.905 --> 09:01.274
you were convinced that
your husband was being framed.

09:01.307 --> 09:04.978
Well,
that was before they found
his sperm on my daughter.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.581
All that means is that
he slept with her.

09:07.614 --> 09:10.116
It doesn't mean that
he killed her.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.218
Now, you said it yourself.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.689
Somebody could be
taking advantage of
this so-called affair

09:15.722 --> 09:17.858
to frame him.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.593
Well, I seriously
doubt it.

09:19.626 --> 09:22.062
But it is possible.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.630
On that possibility,

09:23.664 --> 09:25.866
that this is
somebody framing him,

09:25.899 --> 09:27.167
I need you to testify

09:27.200 --> 09:29.736
that from all you know
about Raymond,

09:29.770 --> 09:32.673
you couldn't conceive
of him being a killer.

09:35.341 --> 09:39.813
Kate,
what if he is innocent?

09:39.846 --> 09:41.281
He's a rapist,
as far as I'm--

09:41.314 --> 09:44.885
But he's on trial
for murder here.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.988
I need you to walk
into that room with him.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.190
Both of you--
you and Jenny.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.358
The jury
needs to see that.

09:52.392 --> 09:55.195
You want to divorce him after,
do it,

09:55.228 --> 10:00.133
but for the purpose
of this trial...

10:06.239 --> 10:08.308
Your mother once thought
somebody with a grudge

10:08.341 --> 10:09.643
against Fiona
killed her.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.211
Oh, yeah,
that makes a lot of sense.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.846
And did he first
go to my stepfather

10:12.879 --> 10:14.681
and ask to borrow some semen?

10:14.715 --> 10:18.885
It is possible your stepdad
had sex with Fiona

10:18.919 --> 10:19.953
some time
before she was killed,

10:19.986 --> 10:21.187
and then the semen--

10:21.221 --> 10:22.188
Can I just go?

10:22.222 --> 10:23.924
Um, your, um...

10:23.957 --> 10:26.259
your mother said she had
some problems with Fiona,

10:26.292 --> 10:28.695
with some of the friends
she kept.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.231
She said she even got
into big arguments

10:31.264 --> 10:33.667
with Fiona over it.
Is that true?

10:33.700 --> 10:36.202
So? We all had problems
with Fiona.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.438
She was a druggie
and a liar.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.175
But I'm told she had
some particular problems.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.177
Your mother and Fiona

10:44.210 --> 10:46.246
became quite estranged
for a while, didn't they?

10:49.215 --> 10:50.784
Why do you have to
drag Jenny in?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.085
I don't want her
terrorized.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.353
She has knowledge

10:53.386 --> 10:54.955
of Fiona's estrangement
with her mother.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.690
I can testify to that.

10:56.723 --> 10:59.025
Your word might seem
a little self-serving, Raymond,

10:59.059 --> 11:01.461
plus juries don't tend to
attach that much credibility

11:01.494 --> 11:03.096
to statutory rapists.

11:05.465 --> 11:09.369
Sorry, but that's nothing
compared to

11:09.402 --> 11:11.004
what you're in for tomorrow.

11:11.037 --> 11:12.839
We've also subpoenaed
Elena Wharton,

11:12.873 --> 11:14.708
the woman you were having
an affair with.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.442
-Why?
-Well, as luck would have it,

11:16.476 --> 11:18.712
there's a portion
of the murder night

11:18.745 --> 11:19.946
she was home alone
with no alibi.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.482
What, you're going
to accuse her, too?

11:22.516 --> 11:24.284
No. The prosecution's
second chair

11:24.317 --> 11:26.319
is a man we've been
up against many times.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.888
Our fear is that

11:27.921 --> 11:29.422
he'll be looking for us
to plan "B" somebody.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.324
He might try to tip
that somebody off.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.493
We're calling your ex-mistress
as a red herring,

11:33.527 --> 11:36.429
hoping they think she's the one
we plan to ambush.

11:36.462 --> 11:37.898
We can't have Kate

11:37.931 --> 11:39.900
getting any hint
that this is coming.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.068
If she's ready for us,
she's too smart.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.904
We'll fall
flat on our faces,

11:43.937 --> 11:46.172
and you'll be doing life
with no parole.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.446
What else?

11:53.479 --> 11:56.382
We thought about trying

11:56.416 --> 11:58.284
to deny the affair
altogether.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.053
We've decided against it.
There's a good chance

12:00.086 --> 12:01.855
that the jurors
have already heard

12:01.888 --> 12:03.389
about all
the suppressed statements.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.859
Also, we can't
put you up there to lie,

12:05.892 --> 12:09.262
and we do think
you will have to testify.

12:09.295 --> 12:12.533
You just keep denying
that you killed her.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.135
The D. A. will come hard,
you hold fast.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.437
You didn't kill her.

12:17.470 --> 12:21.041
Which is the truth.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.782
Okay.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.784
We'll see you
in court tomorrow.

12:30.817 --> 12:34.387
Kate actually agreed
to testify?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.856
I convinced her

12:35.889 --> 12:37.558
to just see you
through this trial.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.926
You duped her.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.462
So we can ambush her
on the stand?

12:42.495 --> 12:45.398
You can certainly direct us
not to do it.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.333
Your choice.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.843
We'll see you in court.

13:04.518 --> 13:07.087
It figures to be
a lightning-quick trial,

13:07.120 --> 13:08.822
probably two days.

13:08.855 --> 13:12.225
All the prosecution witnesses
go to science and DNA.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.960
The big question is,

13:13.994 --> 13:16.863
will Raymond Littlefield
testify in his own defense,

13:16.897 --> 13:18.298
and if he does,

13:18.331 --> 13:20.834
how will he explain
his affair with the victim

13:20.867 --> 13:25.038
and the presence of his semen
on the victim's body?

13:25.071 --> 13:26.973
Come on. Mr. Donnell?

13:27.007 --> 13:28.509
MAN: How do you explain
the semen?

13:28.542 --> 13:30.110
JIMMY: No questions
right now.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.512
How long do you think
the trial will last?

13:31.545 --> 13:33.413
Can you tell us,
Mrs. Littlefield...

13:33.446 --> 13:35.181
BOBBY: Put it
on my tab. Please.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.216
Please.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.852
(reporters shouting)

13:44.424 --> 13:46.426
You and I
are still unreconciled?

13:46.459 --> 13:47.928
Oh, I'm fine.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.563
It just doesn't bring me
any particular joy

13:49.596 --> 13:51.031
to serve poached eggs

13:51.064 --> 13:52.866
to someone
who calls me a cheater.

13:52.899 --> 13:54.568
See, the problem is,
as a D. A.,

13:54.601 --> 13:57.237
you expect everybody
to forgive your cheating

13:57.270 --> 13:58.872
as a professional courtesy.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.941
Oh, that's clever.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.576
Whoa!

14:02.609 --> 14:04.578
There's nothing wrong
with the eggs.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.312
It's not the eggs.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.982
Are you sick again?

14:09.015 --> 14:10.984
No, I don't think
I'm sick.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.519
What's wrong
with you, then?

14:12.553 --> 14:14.454
It-- It's her.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.122
It's the alien?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.591
I'm in labor.

14:17.624 --> 14:21.427
Okay, okay, uh, should--
should I call 911?

14:21.461 --> 14:22.663
No, call the doctor--
tray.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.265
-Okay.
-I am going to get dressed.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.133
-Okay.
-The bag?

14:27.167 --> 14:28.602
Okay, uh,
it's packed.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.170
Uh, uh...

14:30.203 --> 14:32.338
okay, uh,
what do I do now?

14:32.372 --> 14:33.907
Helen,
call the hospital.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.442
Okay, okay.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.444
It was the blow
just above her ear

14:38.478 --> 14:40.547
that was most likely
the fatal one.

14:40.581 --> 14:43.684
How many times was she struck
with the golf club, doctor?

14:43.717 --> 14:46.086
There were four
independent fractures,

14:46.119 --> 14:48.454
so we know it was
at least that many times.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.291
And the cause of death
was a fractured skull?

14:51.324 --> 14:53.093
That's correct.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.029
In terms of trajectory,
was this a case

14:56.062 --> 14:58.632
of the club
being swung downward?

14:58.665 --> 15:00.266
No, it came in
quite level,

15:00.300 --> 15:02.335
almost like
the perfect baseball swing.

15:02.368 --> 15:04.237
Yes, in fact,
in your initial findings,

15:04.270 --> 15:07.107
you stated the killer was
probably of similar height

15:07.140 --> 15:09.409
to the victim,
didn't you, doctor?

15:09.442 --> 15:11.411
Well, the area she was killed
was on an incline.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.146
In your initial report,

15:13.179 --> 15:15.982
you stated the killer was
probably of similar height

15:16.016 --> 15:18.218
to the victim.
True or false, doctor?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.954
True, but I amended
that finding.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.288
Upon an examination
of the terrain

15:22.322 --> 15:23.690
where she was killed,

15:23.724 --> 15:25.491
it became likely
that the killer was

15:25.526 --> 15:27.661
standing at a downward slope
from the victim.

15:27.694 --> 15:31.031
You amended your finding
before or after

15:31.064 --> 15:33.333
the DNA match
to my client?

15:33.366 --> 15:36.169
I believe it was after.

15:38.204 --> 15:41.241
Your doctor again?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.510
Lefkowitz --
Jane Lefkowitz.

15:43.544 --> 15:44.978
Look, I'm pre-registered.

15:45.011 --> 15:46.680
I'm already
in the computer.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.983
-WOMAN: F-r-u-t-t?
-Yes, as in Frutt.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.685
Listen, I know
you're required by law

15:51.718 --> 15:53.587
to be as slow
as humanly possible,

15:53.620 --> 15:55.355
but she's in
a lot of pain here.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.157
Do you have
any drugs on you?

15:57.190 --> 15:58.525
Okay, here we go,

15:58.559 --> 16:00.493
and Dr. Lefkowitz
knows that you're here?

16:00.527 --> 16:02.696
No, we actually thought
we'd wait for you to call her.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.598
-Yes, she's on her way.
-Can I just get something
for the pain?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.266
Can we get her admitted?
She's having a baby.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.568
Who are you?

16:07.601 --> 16:09.570
I'm the father.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.072
We found the golf club

16:12.105 --> 16:14.074
in the golf bag
in the garage.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.009
Did you dust
for fingerprints?

16:16.042 --> 16:19.513
We did. All the prints
matched the defendant.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.014
What about blood?

16:21.047 --> 16:23.183
We were able
to scrape blood samples

16:23.216 --> 16:25.752
from inside the grooves
on the face of the club.

16:25.786 --> 16:27.187
DNA tests showed

16:27.220 --> 16:29.022
a genetic match
with the victim.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.724
So under your theory,
detective,

16:30.757 --> 16:32.659
the murderer
took the weapon home

16:32.693 --> 16:34.661
and just left it
in his own golf bag

16:34.695 --> 16:36.296
for it to be discovered?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.131
I'm sure he thought
he had wiped it clean.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.766
This didn't seem
a little handy?

16:39.800 --> 16:42.102
My client was having
an affair with the victim.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.137
If she were to be killed,
he would have to know

16:44.170 --> 16:46.372
that he would
be considered a suspect,

16:46.406 --> 16:48.474
and he's going to take
the weapon home

16:48.509 --> 16:50.210
and leave it
in plain sight

16:50.243 --> 16:52.412
for it to be discovered
with blood on it?

16:52.445 --> 16:54.781
As I said, he thought
it was wiped clean.

16:54.815 --> 16:57.751
-Was it washed?
-No.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.587
-And these blood scrapings,
were they microscopic?
-No.

17:00.621 --> 17:02.756
You could see the blood
in the grooves.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.324
Yes.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.326
So you want us
to believe that my client

17:06.358 --> 17:08.328
put the murder weapon
in his own garage,

17:08.361 --> 17:10.063
in the open,
without even looking

17:10.096 --> 17:11.698
to see if there was
blood on it?

17:11.732 --> 17:14.166
Once again, our theory
is that he didn't clean it

17:14.200 --> 17:16.603
as well
as he thought he had.

17:16.637 --> 17:18.104
Did you consider
the possibility

17:18.137 --> 17:19.439
that somebody else
planted that club?

17:19.472 --> 17:21.074
In the course of
a murder investigation,

17:21.107 --> 17:23.242
we exhaust
all possibilities, counsel.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.211
Did you consider
Elena Wharton,

17:25.244 --> 17:27.647
that woman over there?

17:27.681 --> 17:29.683
We did.
We ruled her out.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.251
She was having an affair
with my client.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.453
-That's correct.
-And he broke it off.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.188
-Yes.
-Were you able to account

17:35.221 --> 17:36.456
for her whereabouts
on the night of the murder?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.224
She was working late
in her law firm.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.392
Until what time?

17:39.425 --> 17:40.827
I believe
until around 9:00.

17:40.861 --> 17:43.296
-And then?
-She went home.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.131
Can she account
for her whereabouts

17:45.165 --> 17:46.733
for that whole night?

17:46.767 --> 17:47.768
No, but we formed
the impression

17:47.801 --> 17:49.269
she was truthful.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.304
When you decided
to rule her out as a suspect,

17:51.337 --> 17:53.473
that was a judgment,
wasn't it, detective?

17:53.507 --> 17:55.275
You couldn't possibly
exclude her

17:55.308 --> 17:56.710
with evidence, could you?

17:56.743 --> 17:58.244
It was a judgment

17:58.278 --> 18:00.146
made by four different
investigators

18:00.180 --> 18:02.115
with over 100 years
of combined experience.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.284
You couldn't possibly
exclude her

18:04.317 --> 18:07.821
with physical evidence,
could you?

18:07.854 --> 18:09.823
No.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.537
They're going
to plan "B" the mistress.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.205
I should have
guessed it.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.140
Well, they're not going
to come off

18:27.173 --> 18:28.909
very sympathetic
trying to accuse her.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.677
This is
what they do, Susan.

18:30.711 --> 18:32.679
They don't care
how sympathetic they come off.

18:32.713 --> 18:34.681
When they get desperate,
this is what they do.

18:34.715 --> 18:36.750
Well, we may
have to call her now

18:36.783 --> 18:39.219
to refute the idea.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.855
So who's next?

18:41.888 --> 18:44.324
Their forensic expert,
then they should rest.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.392
We'll put up Raymond,
get in his denial,

18:46.426 --> 18:47.928
then call
the ice queen.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.697
Why would she agree
to testify for him?

18:50.731 --> 18:51.832
Come on.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.934
Either because
she believed me--

18:53.967 --> 18:56.537
that he could
possibly be innocent--

18:56.570 --> 19:00.173
or she's planning
to betray him.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.642
Your guess is
as good as mine.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.312
How's it going?

19:06.346 --> 19:07.814
So far, okay.

19:07.848 --> 19:08.849
Ellenor's in labor.

19:08.882 --> 19:10.316
-What?
-She is?

19:10.350 --> 19:11.718
Everything is fine.

19:11.752 --> 19:13.920
She's at the hospital
and Helen's with her.

19:13.954 --> 19:15.388
She doesn't want a crowd.

19:15.421 --> 19:16.623
JIMMY:
But everything's okay?

19:16.657 --> 19:19.660
Everything's
completely fine.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.832
We began having
a sexual relationship

19:25.866 --> 19:28.635
about three months
prior to her death.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.504
Mr. Littlefield--

19:30.537 --> 19:33.540
your 16-year-old
stepdaughter.

19:33.574 --> 19:35.776
I won't try to excuse it.

19:35.809 --> 19:39.646
I was guilty of...
despicable judgment.

19:39.680 --> 19:40.881
Are you aware

19:40.914 --> 19:43.717
that most people
find you depraved?

19:43.750 --> 19:48.555
I suppose I am depraved,
but...

19:48.589 --> 19:51.658
I did not kill Fiona.

19:51.692 --> 19:53.727
Can you account
for how she was killed

19:53.760 --> 19:55.395
with one
of your golf clubs?

19:55.428 --> 19:57.497
No.

19:57.531 --> 19:59.265
She had a lot
of drug acquaintances--

19:59.299 --> 20:01.467
I wouldn't
call them friends--

20:01.502 --> 20:03.737
and some of them
came to the house.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.739
Maybe one of them--

20:05.772 --> 20:07.674
I don't really know.

20:07.708 --> 20:11.645
All I can say--
I was home that evening.

20:11.678 --> 20:14.848
I never left.
I did not kill her.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.917
Traces of semen
found on her

20:16.950 --> 20:19.485
were genetically matched
to you.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.954
It had to be old semen,

20:20.987 --> 20:22.689
because I didn't make love
to her that day.

20:22.723 --> 20:24.658
Can you account
for how it got there?

20:24.691 --> 20:26.727
No.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.695
Is somebody trying
to frame you, Mr. Littlefield?

20:28.729 --> 20:30.396
I don't know.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.766
All I do know is
what I've already told you.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.668
I did not kill Fiona.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.937
Her blood may be
on my golf club,

20:36.970 --> 20:39.606
my semen may have
been found on her,

20:39.640 --> 20:42.876
but I didn't kill her.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.953
How many times
did you sleep with her?

20:52.986 --> 20:55.522
I'm not sure.

20:55.556 --> 20:56.957
More than 10?

20:56.990 --> 20:58.058
Probably.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.325
More than 20?

20:59.359 --> 21:00.360
I don't know.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.862
More than 30?

21:01.895 --> 21:03.329
It's possible.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.966
Your 16-year-old
stepdaughter.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.701
I didn't kill her.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.003
Yes, and you also
maintained vehemently

21:10.036 --> 21:12.873
that you didn't sleep
with her, didn't you, sir?

21:12.906 --> 21:15.709
-Yes.
-That was a lie,
wasn't it, sir?

21:15.742 --> 21:16.910
Yes.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.344
You lied to the police,

21:18.378 --> 21:19.746
lied to your wife,
everybody,

21:19.780 --> 21:22.382
until they identified
your semen on the corpse.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.484
Then you decided
to be truthful.

21:24.518 --> 21:26.019
Obviously,
I wasn't proud

21:26.052 --> 21:27.821
of having an affair
with my stepdaughter.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.022
Are you proud
of killing her?

21:29.055 --> 21:30.490
I didn't kill her.

21:30.524 --> 21:31.825
Help us out,
Mr. Littlefield. Who did?

21:31.858 --> 21:33.760
-Objection!
-Sustained.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.629
You just happened
to be home alone

21:35.662 --> 21:37.798
the night that your
stepdaughter was murdered.

21:37.831 --> 21:38.832
Yes.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.400
There's nobody who can verify

21:40.433 --> 21:41.768
that you never
left your house?

21:41.802 --> 21:43.336
No.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.706
And your semen just happened
to be on her.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.674
When was the last time

21:47.708 --> 21:49.710
you saw your daughter,
Mr. Littlefield?

21:49.743 --> 21:51.444
That morning,
when she left for school.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.880
-Never saw her again.
-No.

21:53.914 --> 21:56.016
She had swim practice
that day, didn't she?

21:56.049 --> 21:57.584
Yes.

21:57.618 --> 21:59.052
And how did your semen

21:59.085 --> 22:01.988
manage to get on her
after swim practice?

22:02.022 --> 22:04.024
I don't know.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.827
You don't know?

22:11.164 --> 22:14.635
Nothing further.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.851
He actually did okay.

22:30.884 --> 22:32.452
You think?

22:32.485 --> 22:34.755
I'm not saying
the jury liked him,

22:34.788 --> 22:35.889
but he held tough

22:35.922 --> 22:38.024
on the denial
of killing her.

22:38.058 --> 22:39.793
Is there any chance
you can win this

22:39.826 --> 22:42.162
on the elements--
reasonable doubt?

22:42.195 --> 22:45.566
I don't know.

22:45.599 --> 22:47.400
Look, if you can
avoid plan "B,"

22:47.433 --> 22:48.902
then do it.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.104
It's too risky.
If you fail, you're done.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.973
I mean, if there's even a shot
at reasonable doubt, then--

22:53.006 --> 22:54.775
I just--

22:54.808 --> 22:56.777
he's a statutory rapist.

22:56.810 --> 22:59.445
The blood
was on his club.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.982
He did sleep with her,
and...

23:02.015 --> 23:04.150
And Kate Littlefield
won't be easy.

23:04.184 --> 23:07.453
If we go after her
and don't get her,

23:07.487 --> 23:08.855
it's over.

23:08.889 --> 23:12.759
I just don't feel like
we got reasonable doubt.

23:12.793 --> 23:16.630
I just don't feel it.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.498
Jimmy?

23:18.532 --> 23:21.502
Me neither.

23:21.535 --> 23:25.138
Well, like Jimmy said,

23:25.171 --> 23:29.576
if you go after her,
you better get her.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.719
Why isn't anything
happening?

23:38.752 --> 23:41.121
-Helen.
-Oh, come on,
it's been 24 hours.

23:41.154 --> 23:42.188
Helen.

23:42.222 --> 23:45.091
I want to break your water.
It'll accelerate things.

23:45.125 --> 23:46.593
Isn't it supposed to
break on its own?

23:46.627 --> 23:47.828
Well, usually, yes,

23:47.861 --> 23:50.230
but we could wait.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.132
More of this?
No, thank you.

23:52.165 --> 23:53.834
You-- You're breaking
her water?

23:53.867 --> 23:55.502
This shouldn't hurt.

23:55.536 --> 23:57.237
ELLENOR: Okay.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.805
Mm.

24:00.674 --> 24:02.943
There we go.

24:02.976 --> 24:07.013
(monitor beeping)

24:07.047 --> 24:08.114
Baby's in decel.

24:08.148 --> 24:10.483
-The cord's compressed.
-What?

24:10.517 --> 24:12.052
Carol, fluid bolus,
terbutaline, please.

24:12.085 --> 24:13.554
Okay, Ellenor,
I want you on your side.

24:13.587 --> 24:15.255
-What's going on?
-Give us a hand.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.190
-What is wrong?
-The baby's not getting
the oxygen she needs.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.725
Oh, my God!

24:18.759 --> 24:20.694
We're okay. I just
want to see if the baby

24:20.727 --> 24:22.629
likes this position
a little better.

24:22.663 --> 24:24.865
-Well, what if she doesn't?
-Just give it a sec.

24:24.898 --> 24:26.166
The baby can't breathe?

24:31.905 --> 24:33.607
I'll just ask
a few questions

24:33.640 --> 24:35.742
like we talked about,
then I'll be done.

24:35.776 --> 24:37.511
It's basically
just to demonstrate

24:37.544 --> 24:39.079
to the jury
that you'll be with him.

24:41.181 --> 24:44.250
Which I'm not,
necessarily.

24:44.284 --> 24:46.720
Kate,
you'll be under oath.

24:46.753 --> 24:50.624
Okay.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.560
Go ahead.
I'll meet you in there.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.103
You going to go
after her on direct?

25:03.136 --> 25:05.005
No, I'll wait
till after cross.

25:05.038 --> 25:06.239
What about Jenny?

25:06.272 --> 25:08.575
I made sure
she won't be in the room.

25:08.609 --> 25:11.144
I told her we just
need her back for closings.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.613
Okay.

25:12.646 --> 25:14.314
Showtime.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.316
Who knows?

25:16.349 --> 25:18.785
Maybe she is taking
the stand to bury him.

25:18.819 --> 25:20.286
That would be nice.

25:24.658 --> 25:25.759
How's she doing?

25:25.792 --> 25:27.594
There's been
some complications

25:27.628 --> 25:28.862
with the umbilical cord.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.196
What?

25:30.230 --> 25:32.666
Is she okay?

25:32.699 --> 25:36.169
(monitor beeping)

25:46.780 --> 25:48.749
Heart rate's back up.

25:48.782 --> 25:50.216
What's going on?

25:50.250 --> 25:52.686
I want you to lay on your side
like this, Ellenor.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.220
She likes
this position better.

25:54.254 --> 25:55.622
Page the anesthesiologist.

25:55.656 --> 25:57.290
Could you tell me
what's going on?

25:57.323 --> 25:59.192
The cord was wrapped
around the baby's neck.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.227
Then do a C-section.
Get the baby out.

26:01.261 --> 26:03.329
Well, I don't think
Ellenor should

26:03.363 --> 26:06.099
undergo another procedure
if we can help it.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.001
Just save the baby.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.269
What I'd like to try

26:09.302 --> 26:11.337
is something called
amnioinfusion.

26:11.371 --> 26:14.107
Basically, we fill
your uterus up with water,

26:14.140 --> 26:16.910
try and float the baby
into a better position.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.012
I don't care what you do.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.747
You save the baby.

26:20.781 --> 26:23.249
I want to save you both.

26:31.324 --> 26:33.760
I was sure
he didn't do it.

26:33.794 --> 26:35.361
Why were you so sure?

26:35.395 --> 26:38.865
Because I know Raymond.
He's a peaceful man.

26:38.899 --> 26:41.301
The idea that he would
ever take a golf club and--

26:41.334 --> 26:43.136
I just couldn't conceive

26:43.169 --> 26:46.106
that he could ever
be capable of that.

26:46.139 --> 26:47.674
Have you ever known him

26:47.708 --> 26:49.242
to act violently
toward your daughter?

26:49.275 --> 26:50.977
No, I haven't.

26:51.011 --> 26:53.413
On the days leading up
to your daughter's death,

26:53.446 --> 26:55.315
did Raymond
say or do anything

26:55.348 --> 26:57.884
to suggest that he intended
to harm your daughter?

26:57.918 --> 27:00.687
No.

27:00.721 --> 27:02.756
Thank you,
Mrs. Littlefield.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.661
Is he kidding?

27:07.694 --> 27:09.162
What else
could he really ask?

27:09.195 --> 27:10.196
Why call her?

27:10.230 --> 27:11.832
Ms. Alexander?

27:11.865 --> 27:14.835
Mrs. Littlefield...

27:14.868 --> 27:16.903
ahem.

27:16.937 --> 27:19.840
Could you ever conceive
that your husband

27:19.873 --> 27:22.676
would repeatedly
commit statutory rape

27:22.709 --> 27:24.110
against your daughter?

27:24.144 --> 27:25.378
No.

27:25.411 --> 27:26.947
So then, obviously,

27:26.980 --> 27:28.381
you didn't know him
like you thought, did you?

27:28.414 --> 27:30.183
No.

27:30.216 --> 27:33.286
And after his semen
was found on your daughter,

27:33.319 --> 27:36.056
are you still convinced
that he didn't kill her,

27:36.089 --> 27:37.691
Mrs. Littlefield?

27:40.093 --> 27:41.928
Mrs. Littlefield,

27:41.962 --> 27:44.064
are you still convinced
of your husband's innocence?

27:44.097 --> 27:45.699
Yes or no.

27:51.004 --> 27:53.206
No.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.475
Thank you.

27:55.509 --> 27:57.711
Yes, thank you.

27:59.913 --> 28:03.116
Mr. Donnell, redirect?

28:06.753 --> 28:08.388
Mr. Donnell?

28:21.467 --> 28:25.005
Mrs. Littlefield...

28:25.038 --> 28:28.074
where were you the night
your daughter was murdered?

28:28.108 --> 28:29.442
I beg your pardon?

28:29.475 --> 28:31.111
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile.

28:31.144 --> 28:32.245
What's going on?
There's no foundation.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.080
She's not
on trial here.

28:34.114 --> 28:36.282
Your honor, I'd like to be able
to cross-examine this witness.

28:36.316 --> 28:37.283
Objection!

28:37.317 --> 28:38.952
This is a murder trial.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.521
I should be allowed
a wide latitude

28:40.554 --> 28:42.322
to examine this witness.

28:42.355 --> 28:43.924
I'm not sure
where you're headed,

28:43.957 --> 28:45.391
but go ahead.

28:45.425 --> 28:48.494
Where were you the night
of the murder, Mrs. Littlefield?

28:48.529 --> 28:50.163
Excuse me?

28:50.196 --> 28:51.832
I'd like you to
answer my question.

28:51.865 --> 28:54.100
(sighs) I was at
a school board meeting

28:54.134 --> 28:56.102
for Fiona
and Jenny's school.

28:56.136 --> 28:57.337
You left at what time?

28:57.370 --> 29:00.006
Around 9:00,
maybe a little later.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.076
-Came home when?
-A little bit before 10:00.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.011
Can anybody verify that
you went directly home?

29:05.045 --> 29:07.047
Are you suggesting that I'm
involved in my daughter's--

29:07.080 --> 29:10.016
Can anybody verify
you went directly home?

29:14.054 --> 29:16.790
Raymond was asleep
when I got home.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.124
-So the answer is no.
-I object.

29:18.158 --> 29:20.026
Overruled.

29:20.060 --> 29:21.962
What was your relationship
with your daughter Fiona

29:21.995 --> 29:23.029
at the time
of her death?

29:23.063 --> 29:24.464
Your honor--

29:24.497 --> 29:27.200
Mrs. Littlefield,
please answer the question.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.469
Was your relationship
with Fiona

29:29.503 --> 29:31.805
estranged at the time
of her death?

29:31.838 --> 29:34.074
I wouldn't call it
estranged, no.

29:34.107 --> 29:36.309
So if your husband
and your daughter Jenny

29:36.342 --> 29:38.244
called it estranged,
they would be mistaken?

29:38.278 --> 29:41.014
No, Fiona and I had
our problems. So what?

29:41.047 --> 29:42.949
In fact, her drug problems,
her drug friends

29:42.983 --> 29:45.451
threatened your social
standing, didn't it?

29:45.485 --> 29:47.120
That's ridiculous.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.855
Your testimony suddenly
and conveniently

29:48.889 --> 29:49.856
seemed to damn
your husband.

29:49.890 --> 29:51.825
That was a bit
of a surprise.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.594
Did you pretend
to be supporting him

29:53.627 --> 29:55.128
so we would
put you up there

29:55.161 --> 29:56.162
where you could
then torpedo him?

29:56.196 --> 29:57.197
-Objection!
-What?

29:57.230 --> 29:58.599
Sustained.

29:58.632 --> 30:00.967
Upon Fiona's death,
you became sole beneficiary

30:01.001 --> 30:02.503
of a $2 million trust,
didn't you?

30:02.536 --> 30:04.304
I am wealthy

30:04.337 --> 30:06.239
exclusive of that trust,
Mr. Donnell.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.208
You're wealthy,
or your husband is?

30:08.241 --> 30:09.610
We are.
We're married.

30:09.643 --> 30:11.477
Yes,
and if you got divorced,

30:11.512 --> 30:13.346
you would lose half
that estate, wouldn't you?

30:13.379 --> 30:14.581
Objection!

30:14.615 --> 30:16.349
By sending Mr. Littlefield
off to prison,

30:16.382 --> 30:17.984
you could
technically stay married,

30:18.018 --> 30:19.520
keep all the money,
and not have to live with him.

30:19.553 --> 30:20.954
That works out well,
doesn't it?

30:20.987 --> 30:22.488
You've got
to be kidding me.

30:22.523 --> 30:24.290
You're a smart lady, Kate.
I should have figured it out.

30:24.324 --> 30:26.459
-Objection!
-Sustained.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.394
You found out about your
husband having an affair

30:28.428 --> 30:30.030
with Elena Wharton,
didn't you, Kate?

30:30.063 --> 30:31.998
-So what?
-And you were furious.

30:32.032 --> 30:34.535
Then you found out
he was sleeping with Fiona.

30:34.568 --> 30:36.269
-Objection!
-Overruled.

30:36.302 --> 30:37.638
You made love
to your husband

30:37.671 --> 30:39.205
the day
before the murder.

30:39.239 --> 30:40.641
That's how
you got the semen.

30:40.674 --> 30:43.009
Then you planted it
on your daughter

30:43.043 --> 30:44.511
after you killed her.

30:44.545 --> 30:45.646
BOTH: Objection!

30:45.679 --> 30:47.948
-You tried to frame him.
-Your honor!

30:47.981 --> 30:50.216
-Mr. Donnell--
-Which is what you're
doing with your testimony.

30:50.250 --> 30:51.284
Did you do it, Kate?

30:51.317 --> 30:52.653
Mr. Littlefield!

30:52.686 --> 30:53.954
Did you kill her?

30:53.987 --> 30:56.523
Mr. Littlefield,
sit down!

31:10.070 --> 31:14.140
It does seem to be
the question, Mrs. Littlefield.

31:17.210 --> 31:19.445
Did you kill your daughter?

31:19.479 --> 31:22.583
You're disgusting,
Mr. Donnell.

31:22.616 --> 31:25.151
Are you avoiding
the question?

31:25.185 --> 31:29.590
No, I did not
kill my daughter.

31:29.623 --> 31:31.625
He did.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.234
MAN: Could she have
committed the murder?

31:41.267 --> 31:42.669
WOMAN: What is the motive?

31:42.703 --> 31:44.505
What about the daughters,
Mr. Donnell?

31:44.538 --> 31:47.140
WOMAN: What is it,
Mr. Donnell? If she's guilty...

31:47.173 --> 31:49.442
Did I go far enough?

31:49.475 --> 31:51.444
I think so. I mean,
there wasn't anything else

31:51.477 --> 31:53.046
to go after her with.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.682
We rattled her, anyway.
I wasn't sure we would.

31:57.684 --> 31:59.686
(exhales)
Wow.

31:59.720 --> 32:01.655
Yeah.

32:01.688 --> 32:03.690
So, what now?

32:03.724 --> 32:05.325
I doubt they'll re-cross.

32:05.358 --> 32:07.427
They may have a couple
of clean-up witnesses,

32:07.460 --> 32:08.995
then it's closing arguments.

32:09.029 --> 32:11.097
We take what we just
tried to manufacture

32:11.131 --> 32:12.599
and argue it
as best we can.

32:12.633 --> 32:14.968
Okay.

32:15.001 --> 32:18.038
Nice touch, Raymond.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.542
Getting up like that.

32:21.575 --> 32:24.978
I didn't know
you were such a good actor.

32:33.186 --> 32:35.622
They had to fill up
her uterus?

32:35.656 --> 32:37.991
They're trying to swish
the baby around

32:38.024 --> 32:40.727
-into a better position.
-Is it working?

32:40.761 --> 32:42.095
They don't know.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.197
ELLENOR: Eugene?

32:44.230 --> 32:45.999
EUGENE: Ellenor.

32:46.032 --> 32:48.602
I'm here, too, Ellenor.

32:48.635 --> 32:50.203
She's labored down.

32:50.236 --> 32:52.472
Okay, then. Let's get you
on your back,

32:52.506 --> 32:54.107
see if the infusion worked.

32:55.441 --> 32:56.409
Okay.

32:56.442 --> 32:57.644
(groans)

33:00.647 --> 33:02.783
It's time to push,
Ellenor.

33:02.816 --> 33:04.417
She's okay?

33:04.450 --> 33:07.521
Who's ever staying, stay.
Everybody else, out.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.528
Why would he take
the murder weapon

33:14.561 --> 33:16.530
back to his own house,

33:16.563 --> 33:18.632
not even wash it,

33:18.665 --> 33:20.734
stick it in his golf bag?

33:20.767 --> 33:24.304
Come on.
This man was framed.

33:24.337 --> 33:28.041
The blood was left there
on purpose.

33:28.074 --> 33:29.510
Who had access
to that golf club,

33:29.543 --> 33:31.111
ladies and gentlemen?

33:31.144 --> 33:35.115
Who was in a position
to get a semen sample?

33:35.148 --> 33:38.284
The woman who was estranged
from the victim.

33:38.318 --> 33:41.121
The woman who would inherit
$2 million

33:41.154 --> 33:42.656
upon the victim's death.

33:42.689 --> 33:45.458
The woman who would get
three times that much

33:45.491 --> 33:48.595
if she got sole control
over her husband's estate,

33:48.629 --> 33:53.233
and what better way to do that
than to frame him for a crime

33:53.266 --> 33:56.302
that would give him
a life sentence in prison?

33:56.336 --> 33:57.804
She did it.

33:57.838 --> 34:01.608
She had no alibi for at least
an hour that night.

34:01.642 --> 34:04.244
The initial coroner's report
said that the killer

34:04.277 --> 34:06.780
was the same height
as the victim.

34:06.813 --> 34:08.414
She did it.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.484
She had opportunity, motive.

34:11.518 --> 34:14.353
Kate Littlefield
committed this crime.

34:14.387 --> 34:17.223
She endured her husband
having an affair

34:17.257 --> 34:18.592
with Elena Wharton,

34:18.625 --> 34:20.594
then when she discovered

34:20.627 --> 34:23.263
he was sleeping
with her daughter,

34:23.295 --> 34:25.431
she would not endure that.

34:25.465 --> 34:28.368
Raymond didn't suspect her.
Who could?

34:28.400 --> 34:29.803
His own wife?

34:29.835 --> 34:32.371
The victim's mother?

34:32.405 --> 34:36.109
But as she sat up
in that witness chair,

34:36.141 --> 34:39.713
pretending to be testifying
for him,

34:39.746 --> 34:43.550
then only quickly to cave
and sink him on cross,

34:43.583 --> 34:45.185
it hit me.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.554
She even went so far

34:47.588 --> 34:50.556
as to set herself up
as the ideal defense witness.

34:50.591 --> 34:54.460
She is smart,
ladies and gentlemen--

34:54.494 --> 34:58.765
maybe smart enough
to get away with murder.

35:00.534 --> 35:04.304
It's preposterous.
That's all I can say.

35:04.337 --> 35:06.773
He's admitted
he's been sleeping with her.

35:06.807 --> 35:09.375
She's found dead
with his semen on her.

35:09.409 --> 35:12.913
The murder weapon
is his golf club,

35:12.946 --> 35:14.581
and defense counsel,

35:14.615 --> 35:16.917
recognizing how insurmountable
the evidence is

35:16.950 --> 35:18.585
against his client,

35:18.619 --> 35:21.254
has concocted
this ridiculous tale.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.657
The absurdity of it
would be comical

35:23.690 --> 35:26.226
if it weren't so cynical,

35:26.259 --> 35:27.661
and, yes, depraved.

35:27.694 --> 35:30.430
As a ploy to rustle up
some doubt,

35:30.463 --> 35:33.333
they employ this
Pearl Harbor attack

35:33.366 --> 35:35.936
against the mother
of the victim.

35:35.969 --> 35:38.805
These lawyers
have done this before.

35:38.839 --> 35:40.541
JIMMY/BOBBY: Objection!

35:40.574 --> 35:42.676
Sustained. Argue the case,
Ms. Alexander,

35:42.709 --> 35:44.410
not the attorneys.

35:44.444 --> 35:49.338
The case is this man raped
his 16-year-old stepdaughter,

35:50.651 --> 35:52.919
and then he murdered her.

35:55.488 --> 35:59.192
3, 4, 5, push!

35:59.225 --> 36:00.794
Oh, you're doing great.
You're doing great.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.462
No, I'm not!

36:02.495 --> 36:04.565
-Yes, you are.
-Keep going.

36:04.598 --> 36:06.967
-How long do
these things last?
-Will you please?

36:07.000 --> 36:08.735
HELEN:
Oh, you're doing great.

36:08.769 --> 36:10.270
DR. LEFKOWITZ: Okay, okay.

36:10.303 --> 36:13.406
(knock on door)

36:13.439 --> 36:16.877
What's up? Ex parte?

36:16.910 --> 36:21.582
Are you worried about
being unethical, Bobby?

36:23.850 --> 36:25.819
Close the door.

36:30.490 --> 36:33.627
I'm going to assume
you have a good-faith belief

36:33.660 --> 36:36.697
that the wife might
possibly be the killer.

36:36.730 --> 36:38.565
I do.

36:38.599 --> 36:40.567
I'm also going to assume

36:40.601 --> 36:43.003
that when you called her
to the stand

36:43.036 --> 36:44.571
as your witness,

36:44.605 --> 36:46.573
she had
absolutely no idea

36:46.607 --> 36:48.975
what you had
in store for her.

36:49.009 --> 36:52.012
You and I disagree
a lot, Bobby,

36:52.045 --> 36:55.015
but underneath
all our disputes

36:55.048 --> 36:57.017
and even
our occasional anger,

36:57.050 --> 37:01.622
there's always been
a respect.

37:03.957 --> 37:08.995
I no longer
respect you, Bobby.

37:10.964 --> 37:14.601
I tell you this not because
I don't like you,

37:14.635 --> 37:16.570
but rather because I do.

37:16.603 --> 37:19.773
I always have,
and I know you know that.

37:25.812 --> 37:29.049
There's no dignity
in the way you practice law.

37:29.082 --> 37:32.052
Your ethical compass
has become so skewed

37:32.085 --> 37:34.888
that you recently
found yourself on trial

37:34.921 --> 37:36.489
for felony murder

37:36.523 --> 37:38.525
for which you,
quite rightly,

37:38.559 --> 37:40.627
should have been
convicted.

37:40.661 --> 37:42.028
Frankly, I don't know

37:42.062 --> 37:43.997
what was more despicable
today--

37:44.030 --> 37:45.632
what you did

37:45.666 --> 37:48.501
or the look of adrenaline
in your eyes while doing it.

37:48.535 --> 37:50.436
She could be guilty.

37:50.470 --> 37:54.040
But that's irrelevant
to you.

37:54.074 --> 37:57.611
It was the love
of the game

37:57.644 --> 37:59.880
I saw in your eyes.

37:59.913 --> 38:02.616
You had a client
dead to right,

38:02.649 --> 38:05.451
and it was
the ultimate challenge,

38:05.485 --> 38:10.924
and you had fun today,
Bobby.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.095
A lot of people,

38:15.128 --> 38:18.098
when they have children,

38:18.131 --> 38:22.803
they start over a little...
morally.

38:22.836 --> 38:27.373
Or they start
looking at themselves

38:27.407 --> 38:31.778
through the eyes
of their children.

38:34.047 --> 38:37.551
Win or lose, Bobby,

38:37.584 --> 38:40.020
I'd like you
to go home tonight

38:40.053 --> 38:43.323
and hold your son.

38:49.930 --> 38:51.998
-How much longer?
-Helen.

38:52.032 --> 38:53.567
You're doing so great,
Ellenor.

38:53.600 --> 38:56.002
I can see the head.
Keep pushing.

38:57.638 --> 38:58.739
She's almost there,
they can see the head.

38:58.772 --> 39:00.741
She isn't far away, Ellenor.

39:00.774 --> 39:02.075
One more push.
Are you ready?

39:02.108 --> 39:04.611
-No!
-One more push.
Here we go.

39:04.645 --> 39:06.379
I heard "one more push."

39:06.412 --> 39:07.914
One more push.

39:07.948 --> 39:09.482
Oh, you're doing great.

39:09.516 --> 39:11.585
Okay, okay, I lied.
One more push,

39:11.618 --> 39:12.953
but that was good.

39:12.986 --> 39:16.489
Take a deep breath
and push that baby out.

39:16.523 --> 39:21.528
(screaming)

39:21.562 --> 39:24.965
Oh, my God. That sounded like
she was being killed.

39:27.734 --> 39:31.404
Oh, she is beautiful.
She is perfect.

39:31.437 --> 39:32.639
She's gucky.

39:34.174 --> 39:35.976
Here we go.

39:36.009 --> 39:41.014
Here, Ellenor.
Meet your little girl.

39:44.551 --> 39:46.787
She's so beautiful.

39:46.820 --> 39:48.522
Yes, she is.

39:48.555 --> 39:49.890
Have you thought
of a name?

39:49.923 --> 39:52.158
Yeah. Hi.

39:52.192 --> 39:53.794
Zoe.

39:53.827 --> 39:57.130
Zoe's beautiful.

39:58.932 --> 40:02.736
(gurgles)

40:48.849 --> 40:50.884
The defendant
will please rise.

40:53.854 --> 40:57.558
Madame foreperson,
has the jury
reached a verdict?

40:57.591 --> 40:59.593
We have, your honor.

40:59.626 --> 41:00.861
What say you?

41:00.894 --> 41:03.930
Commonwealth
vs. Raymond Littlefield

41:03.964 --> 41:06.700
on the count of murder
in the first degree.

41:06.733 --> 41:11.237
We find the defendant
Raymond Littlefield...

41:11.271 --> 41:13.607
not guilty.

41:13.640 --> 41:15.241
(gallery gasping, exclaiming)

41:15.275 --> 41:17.177
JUDGE HILLER: Silence!
Everyone, be quiet.

41:20.180 --> 41:23.517
Members of the jury,
this completes your service.

41:23.550 --> 41:25.051
Thank you.

41:25.085 --> 41:27.854
Mr. Littlefield,
you are free to go,

41:27.888 --> 41:29.255
and we are adjourned.

41:29.289 --> 41:31.525
(judge pounds gavel)

41:31.558 --> 41:34.761
(gallery murmuring)

41:48.742 --> 41:50.644
You murdered my daughter.

41:50.677 --> 41:53.079
No, Kate, you did it,
and the jury saw it.

41:53.113 --> 41:54.548
-You killed her.
-Get him out of here.

41:54.581 --> 41:56.617
BOBBY: Come on.

41:56.650 --> 41:59.252
MAN: Will he be charged
with statutory rape?

41:59.285 --> 42:00.887
How do you explain that?

42:00.921 --> 42:02.255
WOMAN: You're a pervert!

42:02.288 --> 42:04.024
WOMAN #2: The semen--

42:04.057 --> 42:06.993
Mr. Littlefield, the semen
on your daughter's body--

42:07.027 --> 42:08.629
how do you explain that?

42:08.662 --> 42:10.030
WOMAN: You're a pervert!

42:10.063 --> 42:14.034
(crowd shouting angrily)

42:16.302 --> 42:18.672
Well, great job.

42:18.705 --> 42:22.843
We thought you'd be pleased.

42:22.876 --> 42:25.311
Oh, you think
I'm guilty now?

42:25.345 --> 42:29.049
I have no idea, Raymond.
I bill you either way.

42:31.151 --> 42:33.687
(door opens)

42:33.720 --> 42:35.656
The daughter wants in.

42:35.689 --> 42:37.591
-Not with the mother.
-It's just her.

42:37.624 --> 42:39.059
Raymond?

42:39.092 --> 42:41.895
I'll talk to her.

42:44.998 --> 42:46.667
Proud of yourself, Dad?

42:46.700 --> 42:48.301
Sweetheart, listen to me.

42:48.334 --> 42:50.971
I didn't kill your sister.
I swear I didn't.

42:51.004 --> 42:52.606
It's possible Mom--

42:52.639 --> 42:55.108
She didn't kill her,
trust me.

42:57.243 --> 42:59.913
Neither did you, I know.

43:02.182 --> 43:04.050
But don't you think

43:04.084 --> 43:08.154
any man who screws
both of his stepdaughters

43:08.188 --> 43:11.257
deserves to rot in jail
anyway?

43:19.265 --> 43:20.834
Did you tell Fiona

43:20.867 --> 43:23.303
you were in love
with her, too?

44:01.441 --> 44:04.645
â™ª (theme)

44:27.868 --> 44:29.035
You stinker!
