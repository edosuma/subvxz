I'm older. I tied my tubes.
I have three wonderful children.

08:48.312 --> 08:51.930
But duy come to me and like,
"I want more kids."

08:51.965 --> 08:53.198
-but I'm not ready.
-Wait, does duy really

08:53.233 --> 08:54.432
want more kids?
-Yeah, he wants more kids.

08:54.451 --> 08:55.483
That's going back
to ground zero.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.035
I know, and I'm like...

08:57.070 --> 08:59.287

08:59.323 --> 09:01.156
I don't think I could handle
another child.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.657
And I have a lot
of miscarriages.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.076
It's hard.
It's emotionally draining.

09:05.111 --> 09:08.613
I have 13 pregnancies, and I
end up with 3 living kids...

09:08.632 --> 09:11.049
-Oh, my god.
-...And one stillbirth.

09:11.084 --> 09:14.085
My daughter passed away
when she was 42 weeks.

09:15.455 --> 09:19.424
My second pregnancy, that's when
I had the stillbirth.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.793
We lost our baby girl,

09:21.812 --> 09:25.513
and there's something
inside of him that I...

09:25.566 --> 09:28.183
[voice breaking] "I want another
baby 'cause I lost my daughter."

09:28.235 --> 09:30.268
and he--he went through
the whole thing.

09:33.407 --> 09:37.409
To prepare for my delivery
of my daughter,

09:37.444 --> 09:40.278
they decided to have
an emergency c-section

09:40.313 --> 09:42.364
'cause her heart rate
was dropping.

09:42.416 --> 09:47.285
And so they sedated me
and took the baby daughter out.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.505
She was fine the first hour.
Her heart rate was fine.

09:50.540 --> 09:53.291
After an hour, it dropped,
and she passed away,

09:53.326 --> 09:55.010
and no one knows why.

09:55.045 --> 09:58.329
For me, it's like, I cannot,
like, comprehend the whole thing

09:58.348 --> 09:59.931
because I wasn't coherent.

09:59.967 --> 10:03.301

tried to resuscitate her.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.271
They tried to bring her back.
He was there the whole time.

10:06.306 --> 10:10.108
My husband was in the o.R.
Watching everything,

10:10.143 --> 10:11.509

That's enough.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.945
Don't do that to her anymore.

It's been 15 minutes.
She's not coming back."

inside of him that feel, like,

10:19.620 --> 10:21.019
he lost something.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.571
In our culture,
men shave their head

10:23.624 --> 10:27.025
after they mourn a death
of a loved one.

10:27.044 --> 10:29.961
It's part of the respect
and knowing, like,

10:29.997 --> 10:33.965
"I'm giving up this image
to mourn you."

10:34.001 --> 10:36.835
because I was sedated,

10:36.870 --> 10:38.903
I was not coherent
until the following day.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.589
My husband walked in,
and he shaved his head,

10:41.642 --> 10:47.595

"I am very sorry that...

10:47.648 --> 10:50.765
I can't protect you."

10:50.817 --> 10:55.403
I know right away
that he was traumatized.
