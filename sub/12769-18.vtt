(man) 76-YEAR-OLD FEMALE,
ACUTE SHORTNESS OF...

01:16.083 --> 01:18.458
ADAM,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:18.500 --> 01:21.583
SHE'S GOTTEN WORSE.
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
BRADYCARDIC AT 40
WITH A PRESSURE OF 90.

01:21.625 --> 01:23.583
PLEASE, PETE.
(Sam) RESPIRATORY RATE?

01:23.625 --> 01:26.041
24 AND LABORED.
PUT HER IN BAY ONE.
IS THAT--

01:26.083 --> 01:28.083
MY MOTHER.

01:31.083 --> 01:35.041
WELL, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
YOUR ANGER IS JUSTIFIABLE.

01:35.083 --> 01:37.542
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
HOMICIDE IS JUSTIFIABLE.

01:37.583 --> 01:41.500
OH, IF I HAVE TO HEAR "SHE'S
MY B.F.F." ONE MORE TIME...

01:41.542 --> 01:43.083
WAIT. I'M SORRY. DO--

01:43.125 --> 01:46.750
HAVE YOU EVER DONE ONE OF THOSE
CITY COLLEGE LECTURE THINGS?

01:46.792 --> 01:49.208
BECAUSE YOU LOOK
REALLY FAMILIAR.
NO. NO, THAT WASN'T ME.

01:49.250 --> 01:52.083
SO LET'S--LET'S, UH,
LET'S STAY ON POINT HERE.

01:52.125 --> 01:53.959
I-I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING

01:54.000 --> 01:56.041
IS TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOUR
DAUGHTERS MADE THIS DECISION

01:56.083 --> 01:58.542
AND TO FIGURE OUT
HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.

01:58.583 --> 02:00.959
I'VE RACKED MY BRAIN,
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
LISA AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
SO CLOSE. WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.667
WELL, THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY
ABOUT YOU.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.667
I'M A SINGLE MOTHER
WITH THREE KIDS, DR. WALLACE.

02:08.709 --> 02:11.250
WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG,
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT ME.

02:11.291 --> 02:13.875
(Violet) MAYBE THE GIRLS WERE
TRYING TO REDEFINE THEIR LIVES

02:13.917 --> 02:16.041
IN A WAY THAT IS
MORE MEANINGFUL TO THEM.

02:16.083 --> 02:18.583
MAYBE COMPENSATING FOR LOW
SELF-ESTEEM OR LOOKING FOR

02:18.625 --> 02:21.041
WHAT THEY PERCEIVE
AS UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.

02:21.083 --> 02:24.041
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK. WHAT DOES
CASEY HAVE TO BE UPSET ABOUT?

02:24.083 --> 02:26.083
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED
TO EXPLORE.

02:26.125 --> 02:29.041
WHICH IS ALSO WHY WE NEED
TO SPEAK TO YOUR DAUGHTERS.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.041
(girl) WE'RE NOT PATHETIC,
KNOCKED-UP TEENAGERS.

02:31.083 --> 02:33.291
WE MADE A CHOICE.
IT'S A PACT.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.417
(Sheldon) EXPLAIN THAT TO US.

02:35.458 --> 02:38.291
WHY DID YOU DECIDE
TO GET PREGNANT... TOGETHER?
WHY SHOULD I WORRY

02:38.333 --> 02:41.041
ABOUT GOOD GRADES
AND GETTING INTO COLLEGE

02:41.083 --> 02:43.917
WHEN ALL I WANT
IS TO BE A MOM ANYWAY?

02:43.959 --> 02:45.333
PLUS, INSTANT STATUS.

02:45.375 --> 02:48.709
BABIES LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT.
THAT'S AWESOME.

02:48.750 --> 02:51.750
ARE YOU NOT FEELING LOVED
AT HOME NOW, LISA?
WELL, YEAH.

02:51.792 --> 02:54.291
MY MOM'S A TROOPER.
IT'S JUST...

02:54.333 --> 02:57.041
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON
AROUND THE HOUSE,

02:57.083 --> 03:00.000
SO SHE CAN'T GIVE EACH ONE
OF US ATTENTION, YOU KNOW?
I FELT LOVED

03:00.041 --> 03:02.583
UNTIL MY MOTHER TRIED
TO MAKE ME HAVE AN ABORTION.

03:02.625 --> 03:04.625
(Sheldon) WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK
IS A LACK OF LOVE

03:04.667 --> 03:07.333
COULD BE YOUR MOTHER
TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

03:07.375 --> 03:10.125
SHE'S TRYING TO PROTECT HERSELF.
SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ME.

03:10.166 --> 03:14.250
THAT'S WHY
WE NEED EACH OTHER.

03:14.291 --> 03:16.041
SHE HAS A.V. DISSOCIATION.

03:16.083 --> 03:17.750
PETE, IS SHE--
ATROPINE.

03:17.792 --> 03:19.250
.6.
I CAN'T BREATHE.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.875
SHE'S IN THIRD-DEGREE
HEART BLOCK.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

03:21.917 --> 03:24.041
I NEED TO FLOAT A TEMPORARY
PACEMAKER, STABILIZE HER RHYTHM.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

03:24.083 --> 03:26.458
IF YOU WANT TO STAY, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO STOP TALKING.
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.667
WHERE'S THE DAMN CATHETER?
ALL RIGHT,
HEART RATE'S DROPPING.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.959
PETE, PLEASE, LOOK AT ME.
DO SOMETHING.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.458
GET OUT! IF YOU WANT HER
TO LIVE, GET THE HELL OUT!

03:35.500 --> 03:38.709
(monitor beeping erratically)

03:45.083 --> 03:47.083
SO THE BELARUS COMPETITION,

03:47.125 --> 03:49.083
I WON--
FIRST AMERICAN EVER.

03:49.125 --> 03:53.041
WHAT? THAT'S AMAZING.
WHAT DID YOU PLAY?
RACHMANINOFF'S THIRD.

03:53.083 --> 03:56.041
REALLY? THAT'S LIKE
THE HARDEST CONCERTO THERE IS.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.041
NOT LIKE,
IT IS THE HARDEST.

03:58.083 --> 03:59.834
THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS
ARE IMPOSSIBLE

03:59.875 --> 04:01.709
FOR MOST MUSICIANS TO MASTER.

04:01.750 --> 04:04.667
CHILD OR ADULT.
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD
OF YOUR GRANDSON.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.875
NO ONE PLAYS IT AS WELL
AS PATRICK.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.917
EVERY BIT OF HIS HARD WORK
AND DISCIPLINE SHOWS.

04:08.959 --> 04:11.792
IS THE NUMBNESS CONSTANT
OR DOES IT COME AND GO?

04:11.834 --> 04:14.000
IT COMES AND GOES.

04:14.041 --> 04:16.208
GRAB MY FINGERS
AND SQUEEZE...

04:16.250 --> 04:18.792
HARD AS YOU CAN.

04:20.083 --> 04:23.041
OKAY. NOW HANDS OUT,
PALMS UP.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.875
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

04:28.083 --> 04:31.041
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
WELL, I THINK IT WOULD BE
WORTH GETTING AN M.R.I.,

04:31.083 --> 04:34.041
AND OUR NEUROSURGEON
SHOULD TAKE A LOOK.

04:34.083 --> 04:36.667
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD

04:36.709 --> 04:38.750
ABOUT PROTECTION?
I BOUGHT HER CONDOMS.

04:38.792 --> 04:40.625
I PUT HER
ON BIRTH CONTROL PILLS.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.625
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD'VE JUST
TAPED HER DAMN LEGS SHUT,

04:42.667 --> 04:45.250
BUT I DIDN'T--
LIKE THAT WOULD'VE WORKED.

04:45.291 --> 04:47.709
(Violet)
O-OKAY, OKAY, LET'S CALM DOWN.
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. YOU'RE NOT
THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO BE

04:47.750 --> 04:50.875
CONTENDING WITH THREE KIDS
AND A GRANDCHILD.
WE'RE THE ONES
WHO WILL SACRIFICE.

04:50.917 --> 04:52.917
JAMIE, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

04:52.959 --> 04:55.500
SHE'S PROBABLY GLAD HER MOM'S
NOT HERE TO YELL AT HER.

04:55.542 --> 04:58.000
MY MOM SAID SHE HAD TO
PICK UP MY BROTHER

04:58.041 --> 05:00.667
AND DROP HIM OFF AT HOME.
SHE SAID SHE'D BE BACK.
(Lisa) CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING?

05:00.709 --> 05:02.917
WE'VE BEEN HERE ALL MORNING.
IF WE'RE HERE ALL AFTERNOON,

05:02.959 --> 05:05.917
WE'RE GONNA MISS A LOT MORE
THAN SCHOOL.
I DON'T CARE IF WE'RE HERE
ALL DAY EVERY DAY

05:05.959 --> 05:09.041
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.
WE HAVE TO SORT THIS OUT.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.709
YOU WROTE THIS BOOK.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.041
I KNEW I RECOGNIZED YOU.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.166
I BOUGHT THIS LAST WEEK
AND I'M HALFWAY THROUGH IT,

05:16.208 --> 05:18.792
BUT... SHE'S NOT THE RIGHT
THERAPIST FOR OUR DAUGHTERS.

05:18.834 --> 05:21.750
YOU GUYS, SHE HAS THIS TOTALLY
NASTY SCAR DOWN HER STOMACH.

05:21.792 --> 05:24.500
CAN WE TRY TO FOCUS?
AH, NO LAYING OUT
FOR YOU, EH?

05:24.542 --> 05:27.291
THERE ARE THINGS IN THIS BOOK
THAT I PROMISE YOU

05:27.333 --> 05:30.000
YOU WILL NOT LIKE.
LIKE WHAT?

05:30.041 --> 05:33.000
I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS HER,
BUT--
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE
FOR THIS DISCUSSION.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.542
COULD WE SEE
THE SCAR?
JAMIE, LET'S GO.
WE'RE DONE WITH THIS.

05:42.625 --> 05:45.083
PATRICK'S PARENTS DIED
IN A CAR ACCIDENT WHEN HE WAS 5,

05:45.125 --> 05:47.500
AND DENNIS HAS RAISED HIM
ON HIS OWN EVER SINCE.

05:47.542 --> 05:50.709
HE WAS APPARENTLY A RENOWNED
CONDUCTOR UNTIL HIS SON DIED.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.041
THEN HE TOOK PATRICK IN,
TAUGHT HIM THE PIANO,

05:53.083 --> 05:55.083
AND NOW THIS KID'S A PRODIGY.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.041
MM. CLASSICAL MUSIC
PUTS ME TO SLEEP.

05:57.083 --> 05:59.333
ARE YOU REALLY
THAT UNCULTURED?

05:59.375 --> 06:01.250
THIS COMING FROM THE GUY
WHO RUSHES HOME

06:01.291 --> 06:03.583
TO WATCH OUTTAKES
OF "AMERICAN BAKE-OFF"?

06:03.625 --> 06:06.041
(laughs) OKAY.

06:06.083 --> 06:08.875
(sighs) DAMN IT.

06:08.917 --> 06:10.250
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

06:10.291 --> 06:13.875
IT'S CALLED
A PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA.

06:13.917 --> 06:16.458
IT'S IN THE PART OF THE BRAIN
THAT CONTROLS HAND FUNCTION.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.041
AM I GONNA DIE?
YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE SURGERY.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.250
YOU'LL HAVE TO
CUT INTO HIS BRAIN?

06:21.291 --> 06:23.250
IT'S THE BEST COURSE
OF ACTION.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.250
THE SAFEST AND SIMPLEST ROUTE

06:25.291 --> 06:28.041
WOULD BE RIGHT THROUGH
THE CENTER OF THE MOTOR STRIP.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.041
BUT IF WE GO THROUGH THAT AREA,
THE LIKELIHOOD

06:30.083 --> 06:32.625
IS THAT WE WOULD DESTROY
ALL FUNCTION IN HIS RIGHT HAND.

06:32.667 --> 06:36.000
I... I WON'T BE ABLE
TO PLAY MUSIC ANYMORE?

06:36.041 --> 06:38.291
NO.

06:38.333 --> 06:41.083
ARE THERE
ANY OTHER OPTIONS?

06:42.834 --> 06:45.041
I CAN DO
AN AWAKE CRANIOTOMY.

06:45.083 --> 06:48.250
AWAKE?
DURING BRAIN SURGERY?

06:48.291 --> 06:50.917
BECAUSE YOU'D BE CONSCIOUS
AND ABLE TO TALK TO ME,

06:50.959 --> 06:53.291
I COULD MONITOR YOUR HAND
FUNCTION MUCH MORE CLOSELY

06:53.333 --> 06:56.458
AND TRY TO AVOID DAMAGING
ANY OF THE CORRESPONDING NERVES.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.458
WOULD IT HURT?
THERE ARE NO PAIN SENSORS
ON THE BRAIN.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.875
YOUR SCALP WOULD BE NUMB,
SO YOU WOULD HEAR THE DRILL,

07:01.917 --> 07:03.625
YOU WOULD FEEL PRESSURE
FROM THE VIBRATION,

07:03.667 --> 07:06.917
BUT IT WOULDN'T HURT,
HOWEVER, BECAUSE I WOULD BE

07:06.959 --> 07:08.917
TAKING A LONGER
AND MORE INDIRECT ROUTE,

07:08.959 --> 07:11.917
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY
OF INFLICTING MORE DAMAGE.
WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE?

07:11.959 --> 07:13.291
PATRICK MIGHT END UP

07:13.333 --> 07:16.041
WITH SOME DEGREE OF PARALYSIS
IN HIS RIGHT LEG.

07:16.083 --> 07:20.041
BUT... BUT I'LL
STILL BE ABLE TO PLAY.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.667
UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS IS THE RIGHT--

07:22.709 --> 07:25.041
PLEASE, GRANDPA.
LET HER DO IT.

07:25.083 --> 07:29.083
I DON'T NEED LEGS,
BUT I NEED THE PIANO.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.542
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THE PACEMAKER WILL
BUY US TIME.

07:35.583 --> 07:38.041
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY
HER RHYTHMS DETERIORATED.
HOW IS SHE?

07:38.083 --> 07:40.250
UH, SHE'S STABLE FOR NOW.
WHAT IS SHE DOING
OUT OF JAIL?

07:40.291 --> 07:43.041
WELL, AFTER YOU WOULDN'T SIGN
HER COMPASSIONATE RELEASE,

07:43.083 --> 07:45.041
MOM'S HEALTH GOT WORSE.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.542
SHE DEVELOPED
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.959
AND THE PRISON DOCTORS,
THEY COULDN'T HANDLE IT,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.041
SO... LAST WEEK, THEY, UH,
THEY LET HER OUT.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.750
ANYWAY, THIS MORNING,
SHE, UH,

07:52.792 --> 07:55.041
SHE WAS HAVING A HARD TIME
CATCHING HER BREATH,

07:55.083 --> 07:57.125
SO I CALLED 9-1-1.
ALL RIGHT, DID ANYTHING
BRING THIS ON?

07:57.166 --> 07:59.125
HAS SHE BEEN SMOKING?
JUST A FEW A DAY.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.041
HOW ABOUT DRUGS?
ANYTHING NEW?

08:01.083 --> 08:03.875
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.458
LOOK, I TRIED FINDING ANOTHER
DOCTOR TO SIGN THAT RELEASE.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.041
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT, PETE.

08:08.083 --> 08:10.417
HER HEART SYMPTOMS,
THEY WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH.

08:10.458 --> 08:13.333
SHE JUST WASN'T SICK ENOUGH.
SO SHE TOLD YOU
TO MAKE HER SICK ENOUGH.

08:13.375 --> 08:15.959
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T CARE HOW,
THAT SHE'D DO ANYTHING.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.041
SO I DID SOME RESEARCH,
AND I, UH...

08:18.083 --> 08:21.041
I BRIBED A GUARD WHO, UH,
SLIPPED HER THESE PILLS.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.709
(scoffs)
ALL RIGHT, WHAT--
WHAT KIND OF PILLS?

08:23.750 --> 08:26.959
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
SHE BEGGED ME.
I HAD TO GET HER OUT.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.917
WHAT KIND OF PILLS?
DIGOXIN.

08:29.959 --> 08:32.625
WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
YOU POISONED HER.

08:32.667 --> 08:36.041
(Sam) I NEED 250 MILLIGRAMS
OF DIGIVERSE. NOW.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.917
VIOLET, I THINK
IT MIGHT BE BETTER

08:41.959 --> 08:44.166
IF YOU STEP ASIDE
ON THIS ONE.

08:44.208 --> 08:46.750
SHELDON, SOME PEOPLE WHO READ
MY BOOK WILL BE PATIENTS.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.792
I ANTICIPATED THAT.
I CAN WORK WITH THAT.

08:48.834 --> 08:51.333
IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY
FROM THE FACT

08:51.375 --> 08:53.333
THAT I CAN HELP THESE GIRLS.
I THINK IT DOES.

08:53.375 --> 08:56.041
AS THERAPISTS, WE HAVE TO BE
BLANK SLATES, SOUNDING BOARDS.

08:56.083 --> 08:57.625
THERE'S A REASON
WE'RE JUDICIOUS

08:57.667 --> 08:59.625
ABOUT SHARING OUR PERSONAL LIVES
WITH PATIENTS.

08:59.667 --> 09:02.125
IT DISTRACTS THEM.
THEY WASTE TIME FOCUSING ON US

09:02.166 --> 09:05.041
INSTEAD OF DEDICATING THEIR
ENERGY ON THEIR OWN PROBLEMS.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.458
YOU KNOW THAT
THAT SESSION WAS TAINTED.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.041
THERE WAS NO TAINT THERE.

09:09.083 --> 09:11.375
THERE--THERE WAS TITILLATION,
AND THAT WILL FADE.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.375
THOSE GIRLS
DON'T WANT TO BE HERE,

09:13.417 --> 09:15.625
WHICH MEANS GETTING THROUGH
TO THEM IS AN UPHILL BATTLE.

09:15.667 --> 09:17.041
AND THEIR MOTHERS--
I JUST...

09:17.083 --> 09:20.041
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

09:20.083 --> 09:21.667
IN REPAIRING
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS.

09:21.709 --> 09:23.667
WHICH I CAN DO,
BECAUSE LAST TIME I CHECKED,

09:23.709 --> 09:25.583
ONLY ONE OF US
IS ACTUALLY A MOTHER

09:25.625 --> 09:27.709
OR A FORMER 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.083
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

09:29.125 --> 09:31.458
HAVING A VAGINA DOES NOT GIVE
YOU A DEGREE IN PSYCHIATRY,

09:31.500 --> 09:34.041
AND WHETHER YOU MIGHT
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

09:34.083 --> 09:35.917
YOUR BOOK IS A PROBLEM.

09:35.959 --> 09:39.750
I CAN HANDLE IT, SHELDON.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.417
(machine clicking,
monitor beeping rhythmically)

09:45.458 --> 09:47.417
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT FIND THIS
HARD TO BELIEVE,

09:47.458 --> 09:49.417
BUT I WAS TRYING TO HELP HER.
SHE ALMOST DIED.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.125
I TOLD HIM TO DO IT.

09:51.166 --> 09:54.041
I HAD NO CHOICE
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T HELP ME.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.959
YOU ARE NOT
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.458
YES, SHE IS. PARENTS TAKE CARE
OF THEIR CHILDREN,

09:58.500 --> 10:01.041
THEN CHILDREN STEP UP
FOR THEIR PARENTS.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.291
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO TEACH LUCAS?
YOU LEAVE MY SON OUT OF THIS.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.291
BOYS, PLEASE.
SHE DID NOT TAKE CARE OF US.

10:05.333 --> 10:08.250
I WAS THE ONE WHO MADE SURE WE
HAD SOMETHING TO EAT EVERY DAY.

10:08.291 --> 10:10.417
I WAS THE ONE
WHO PUT US TO BED

10:10.458 --> 10:13.333
ON THE NIGHTS WHEN SHE WAS
DRINKING, WHICH WAS EVERY NIGHT.

10:13.375 --> 10:17.208
DON'T TALK ABOUT ME THAT WAY.
I'M STILL YOUR MOTHER.
YEAH, YOU WERE THERE
AT THE BIRTH,

10:17.250 --> 10:19.208
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT,
BUT THAT'S IT.

10:19.250 --> 10:23.333
HOW DID YOU GET TO BE
SO COLD, PETE?
YOU MADE ME THAT WAY.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.500
(footsteps approach)

10:29.041 --> 10:31.583
YOU LOOK LIKE THE CAT
WHO GOT THE CREAM.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.583
I AM MOST DEFINITELY
THAT CAT.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.542
WHO'S THE LUCKY GIRL?

10:35.583 --> 10:37.041
(exhales deeply)

10:37.083 --> 10:39.041
MARLA THOMPKINS.

10:39.083 --> 10:42.500
THE REVIEWER WHO TRASHED
VIOLET'S BOOK? YOU'RE KIDDING.

10:42.542 --> 10:45.041
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?
OH, I MET HER
AT VIOLET'S BOOK PARTY,

10:45.083 --> 10:46.500
AND THEN SHE CALLED.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.792
I KNEW I SHOULD'VE SAID NO
AFTER WHAT SHE DID TO VIOLET--

10:48.834 --> 10:51.291
ONLY MATTERS WHAT SHE'S DOING TO
YOU, AND FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,

10:51.333 --> 10:53.792
SHE IS DOING IT WELL.
(whispers) I SAY GO FOR IT.

10:53.834 --> 10:56.792
GO FOR WHAT?
(normal voice) MARLA THOMPKINS.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.625
SERIOUSLY?
WAS I SPEAKING IN TONGUES?

10:59.667 --> 11:03.125
YOU'D REALLY DO THAT TO VIOLET?
YES, I'M LATE FOR SOMETHING.

11:05.083 --> 11:07.041
WHO PUT A BUG
UP YOUR ASS?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.583
THAT'D BE ME.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.917
I GAVE HIS PATIENT
AN OPINION HE DIDN'T LIKE.

11:10.959 --> 11:13.041
MY PATIENT IS A PIANO VIRTUOSO.
HE ALSO HAS A BRAIN TUMOR.

11:13.083 --> 11:15.041
THE SAFEST WAY
TO REMOVE THE TUMOR

11:15.083 --> 11:18.041
MAY MEAN THAT HE NEVER PLAYS
THE PIANO AGAIN.
IF I TAKE
A MORE RADICAL APPROACH,

11:18.083 --> 11:20.166
I'LL COMPROMISE HIS LEG
BUT I'LL SPARE HIS HAND.

11:20.208 --> 11:22.333
HE COULD HAVE A STROKE.

11:22.375 --> 11:25.083
YOU COULD KNOCK OUT
HIS HEARING OR HIS VISION.
THIS IS THE SURGERY
THAT PATRICK WANTS.

11:25.125 --> 11:27.083
HE'S 14 YEARS OLD.
HE'S NOWHERE NEAR OLD ENOUGH

11:27.125 --> 11:29.542
TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS
OF A DECISION THIS BIG.

11:29.583 --> 11:32.583
WHAT'S THE RIGHT AGE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN AN ARM AND A LEG?

11:32.625 --> 11:34.834
LOOK,
SOME THINGS YOU JUST KNOW.

11:34.875 --> 11:38.041
I KNEW AT AGE 6
I WAS GONNA BE A SURGEON.
AND WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID,
I WAS OBSESSED WITH THE PIANO

11:38.083 --> 11:40.667
AND THOUGHT MAYBE I WANTED
TO BE A MUSICIAN.
I NEVER KNEW YOU PLAYED.

11:40.709 --> 11:42.166
'CAUSE MY INTERESTS CHANGED.

11:42.208 --> 11:44.166
WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME THEN
IS NOT IMPORTANT TO ME NOW.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.166
AND MAYBE SOMEDAY,
PATRICK'S GONNA WANT

11:46.208 --> 11:49.166
TO WALK DOWN THE AISLE
OR CHASE AFTER HIS KIDS.
LOOK, THIS KID HAS A GIFT.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.709
WHO ARE WE
TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM?

11:55.083 --> 11:57.000
(indistinct conversations)

11:57.041 --> 11:59.583
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
MY DAY GOT WORSE.

11:59.625 --> 12:02.458
YES, ACTUALLY,
I'M MEETING SOMEONE--
SO PETE IS ALL FREAKED OUT

12:02.500 --> 12:04.875
BECAUSE THEY BROUGHT
HIS MOTHER INTO THE E.R.,

12:04.917 --> 12:07.250
AND SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
IN PRISON, BUT HIS BROTHER--

12:07.291 --> 12:10.083
HIS BROTHER, ADAM--GOT HER OUT.
BUT NOT IN ANY NORMAL WAY.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.041
NO, NO, NOT THROUGH
A PAROLE HEARING

12:12.083 --> 12:14.166
OR TIME OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.
NO, HE POISONS HER.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.041
(laughs)
(laughs) HE POISONS HER.

12:16.083 --> 12:19.041
NOW GRANTED THAT IS A COURSE
OF ACTION I'VE BEEN CONSIDERING

12:19.083 --> 12:21.792
WITH MY OWN MOTHER FOR A NUMBER
OF YEARS NOW, BUT I'VE MANAGED

12:21.834 --> 12:24.041
TO KEEP THAT PARTICULAR GENIE
IN THE BOTTLE.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.000
SO FRANCES' HEART
IS NOW DAMAGED,

12:26.041 --> 12:29.417
AND ADAM IS BLAMING PETE,
AND PETE IS BLAMING ADAM--
SORRY I'M LATE.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.041
(Sheldon) OH.
WE DIDN'T THE CHANCE
TO MEET THE OTHER NIGHT

12:32.083 --> 12:34.792
AT YOUR PARTY.
MARLA THOMPKINS.

12:34.834 --> 12:37.041
YEAH,
I-I-I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.625
ARE YOU TWO DATING?

12:39.667 --> 12:42.041
WELL, YOU KNOW...
LABELS CAN BE SO CONFINING.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.583
WE'RE DATING.

12:45.709 --> 12:47.667
PATRICK AND I
HAVE DISCUSSED IT.

12:47.709 --> 12:50.667
WE WILL GO
WITH THE SAFER SURGERY.
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD CALL.

12:50.709 --> 12:54.875
WE DIDN'T DISCUSS IT. GRANDPA
JUST TOLD ME WHAT HE WANTED.

12:54.917 --> 12:56.709
WHAT? IT'S THE TRUTH.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.250
YOU ARE A CHILD.

12:58.291 --> 13:01.000
IT'S MY BRAIN.
PATRICK, WE CAN'T GO AHEAD
WITH A CRANIOTOMY

13:01.041 --> 13:02.333
WITHOUT
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S CONSENT.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.959
BUT IF PATRICK DOES NOT WANT
THE OTHER SURGERY,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.417
WE CAN'T FORCE HIM
TO DO THAT, EITHER.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:07.458 --> 13:09.834
IF IT BECOMES A MATTER
FOR THE COURTS,

13:09.875 --> 13:11.875
THEY'LL PROBABLY GO
WITH WHAT YOU DECIDE,

13:11.917 --> 13:14.250
BUT THAT COULD TAKE WEEKS.
WE DON'T HAVE WEEKS. WE NEED
TO DO THE SURGERY IMMEDIATELY.

13:14.291 --> 13:17.083
OR PATRICK WILL DIE.
WE'LL DO THE SAFER SURGERY.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.083
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WANT.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.583
THE DECISION'S BEEN MADE.
NO, IT'S NOT.

13:21.625 --> 13:24.041
EITHER YOU LET ME DO
THE AWAKE CRANIOTOMY,

13:24.083 --> 13:27.000
OR YOU LET ME DIE.

13:34.625 --> 13:37.625
(playing classical music)

13:41.542 --> 13:43.917
HEY, PATRICK.

13:43.959 --> 13:45.792
HEY.

13:47.750 --> 13:50.917
YOU NEVER GET NERVOUS
WHEN YOU'RE ONSTAGE?

13:50.959 --> 13:53.041
ONCE I START PLAYING,
I'M JUST IN IT.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.125
I GUESS THAT'S A GOOD THING
WHEN YOU'RE PERFORMING.

13:56.166 --> 13:59.208
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT FOCUS ON
WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU,

13:59.250 --> 14:01.625
IT CAN KEEP YOU
FROM SEEING EVERYTHING ELSE.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.208
THIS SURGERY THAT YOU WANT,

14:03.250 --> 14:06.291
YOU COULD SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE IN A WHEELCHAIR.

14:06.333 --> 14:09.291
I DON'T CARE.
YOU DON'T CARE NOW,
BUT I DON'T THINK

14:09.333 --> 14:11.417
YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND
THE DECISION YOU'RE MAKING.

14:11.458 --> 14:13.375
THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL
OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

14:13.417 --> 14:15.375
WHO CAN DO WHAT I DO.

14:15.417 --> 14:17.375
WHEN I PLAY,
EVERY PART OF ME--

14:17.417 --> 14:19.417
MY HANDS,
MY BRAIN, MY SOUL--

14:19.458 --> 14:22.375
IT ALL ENGAGES
IN THIS PERFECT SYNCHRONICITY.

14:22.417 --> 14:25.250
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
I'M WATCHING MYSELF

14:25.291 --> 14:27.208
RATHER THAN ACTUALLY
DOING IT.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.208
I CAN'T REALLY DESCRIBE IT,
BUT--

14:29.250 --> 14:31.208
BEING A MUSICIAN,
THAT FEELING,

14:31.250 --> 14:33.583
I KNOW IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING TO YOU NOW,

14:33.625 --> 14:35.583
BUT YOU'RE JUST A KID.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.250
YOU CAN'T CLOSE YOURSELF OFF
TO THE IDEA THAT OTHER THINGS

14:38.291 --> 14:40.250
COULD BECOME EQUALLY
IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT.

14:40.291 --> 14:44.041
I THINK IF YOU TALK TO
YOUR GRANDFATHER ABOUT THIS...

14:44.083 --> 14:45.667
HE LOVES YOU, PATRICK.

14:45.709 --> 14:48.041
HE LOVES THE WAY I PLAY.
I DON'T THINK MUSIC

14:48.083 --> 14:50.166
IS AS IMPORTANT TO HIM
AS YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.417
MUSIC IS MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH MY GRANDFATHER.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.041
ALL THESE PEOPLE SHOWED UP
AT THE HOUSE

14:55.083 --> 14:57.083
THE NIGHT
MY PARENTS WERE KILLED.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.041
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING THERE,

14:59.083 --> 15:00.875
BUT EVERYONE KEPT ASKING ME

15:00.917 --> 15:04.291
IF I WANTED ICE CREAM
OR PIZZA OR A MOVIE.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.291
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PARTY.

15:06.333 --> 15:10.041
THEN I SAW MY GRANDFATHER,
AND HE LOOKED SO SAD.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.875
I TRIED TO HUG HIM,

15:11.917 --> 15:15.291
AND HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

15:15.333 --> 15:18.375
HE NEVER REALLY
LOOKED AT ME AFTER THAT

15:18.417 --> 15:20.375
UNTIL HE TAUGHT ME
TO PLAY PIANO.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.875
THAT'S HOW WE STARTED
TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER.

15:22.917 --> 15:24.875
YOU CAN LEARN OTHER WAYS
TO COMMUNICATE.

15:24.917 --> 15:27.458
HE CAN'T.

15:27.500 --> 15:30.500
(playing classical music)

15:50.875 --> 15:53.834
(machine clicking)

15:53.875 --> 15:57.208
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

15:57.250 --> 15:58.834
FRANCES.

15:58.875 --> 16:02.875
I'M--I'M VIOLET TURNER.
I'M PETE'S WIFE.

16:02.917 --> 16:04.250
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT--

16:04.291 --> 16:06.667
PETE'S A DOCTOR
MARRIED TO A DOCTOR?

16:06.709 --> 16:08.667
AND A PRETTY ONE, TOO.

16:08.709 --> 16:12.375
AND YOUR BOY LUCAS, IS HE
AS SMART AS THE TWO OF YOU?

16:12.417 --> 16:16.041
SMARTER. (laughs)
HE HAS PETE'S SMILE.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.083
WELL, I NEVER SAW
MUCH OF THAT SMILE.

16:20.375 --> 16:23.583
PETE NEVER TALKS ABOUT
HIS FATHER.

16:23.625 --> 16:27.125
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
HE NEVER KNEW HIM.
YOU TWO WEREN'T TOGETHER
THAT LONG?

16:27.166 --> 16:30.041
LONG ENOUGH
TO HAVE A BABY...

16:30.083 --> 16:32.792
A FEW LAUGHS.

16:35.083 --> 16:38.625
WELL... (clears throat)
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

16:38.667 --> 16:41.041
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

16:41.083 --> 16:43.542
CAN YOU GET PETE
TO TALK TO ME?

16:43.583 --> 16:46.375
WELL, I THINK
THAT'S UP TO PETE.

16:46.417 --> 16:48.333
I'M PROBABLY
ASKING FOR TOO MUCH.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.041
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN HERE.

16:51.083 --> 16:53.000
HE'S JUST COLD.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.834
I CAN'T ERASE WHAT I DID.

16:56.875 --> 17:00.000
I'LL BE JUDGED FOR THAT.

17:00.041 --> 17:03.041
BUT I WANT PETE TO FORGIVE ME.

17:03.083 --> 17:07.041
I NEED THAT BEFORE I...

17:07.083 --> 17:10.208
YOU DON'T OWE ME
ONE DAMN THING.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.834
BUT PLEASE,
CAN YOU HELP ME?

17:17.083 --> 17:20.041
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU PLAYED PIANO?

17:20.083 --> 17:22.041
IT DIDN'T SEEM IMPORTANT.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.625
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU USED TO LOVE IT.
I USED TO LOVE
TO EAT PASTE, TOO.

17:25.667 --> 17:28.625
WHY'D YOU GIVE IT UP?
THE PIANO OR THE PASTE?

17:28.667 --> 17:30.250
DID YOU GET BORED?
NO.

17:30.291 --> 17:32.667
WERE YOU JUST NOT ANY GOOD?
ACTUALLY, I WAS QUITE GOOD.

17:32.709 --> 17:35.417
MY DAD TAUGHT ME. YOU KNOW, MY
MOM, SHE'S NOT AT ALL MUSICAL.

17:35.458 --> 17:38.041
THE WOMAN CAN'T EVEN WHISTLE.
SO IT WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL

17:38.083 --> 17:40.417
THAT ME AND MY DAD SHARED,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.041
THEN WHY'D YOU QUIT?

17:42.083 --> 17:45.041
UH...

17:45.083 --> 17:47.041
I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY BROTHER.

17:47.083 --> 17:49.458
THE ONE WHO DIED
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN--ANDY.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.041
SO WHEN I WAS, LIKE, 15,

17:52.083 --> 17:54.417
I FOUND A PICTURE
TUCKED INTO SOME SHEET MUSIC,

17:54.458 --> 17:56.041
UM, OF ANDY.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.041
AND HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE THAN 4 OR 5,

17:58.083 --> 18:00.041
AND HE WAS SITTING
ON MY DAD'S LAP,

18:00.083 --> 18:02.625
AND MY DAD WAS HOLDING
HIS HANDS ON THE KEYS.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.625
AND SO YOUR DAD TAUGHT
ANDY TO PLAY, TOO.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.208
DOESN'T MEAN
IT WASN'T SPECIAL.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.834
EVERY TIME I PRACTICED,
I WONDERED IF MY DAD

18:08.875 --> 18:10.625
WAS IN THE OTHER ROOM

18:10.667 --> 18:14.875
PRETENDING
IT WAS ANDY PLAYING....

18:14.917 --> 18:17.041
SO I QUIT.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.709
SORRY, COOP.

18:18.750 --> 18:21.250
DON'T BE.
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

18:21.291 --> 18:23.834
YOU WANTED TO KNOW,
AND I TOLD YOU.

18:23.875 --> 18:26.041
(trash crinkles)

18:30.875 --> 18:34.500
(indistinct conversations)

18:39.458 --> 18:41.542
YOU KNOW, UM...

18:43.667 --> 18:46.250
EVERY SUNDAY
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,

18:46.291 --> 18:48.875
MY PARENTS WOULD TAKE ME
TO THIS CHINESE RESTAURANT,

18:48.917 --> 18:51.917
AND, UM... I J--I HATED IT.

18:51.959 --> 18:53.917
IT WAS
ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN,

18:53.959 --> 18:57.000
AND WE WOULD DRIVE IN SILENCE
TO GET TO THIS MEAL

18:57.041 --> 18:59.041
WHERE NOBODY
BASICALLY SAID A WORD.

18:59.083 --> 19:01.500
SO, UM, THE LAST TIME
I WAS HOME,

19:01.542 --> 19:03.500
MY PARENTS WANTED TO GO
TO THAT RESTAURANT,

19:03.542 --> 19:05.458
AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
I'M A GROWN-UP.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.458
I MEAN, HOW BAD CAN IT BE?
(laughs)

19:07.500 --> 19:09.375
WELL, TWO BITES
INTO THIS EGG ROLL,

19:09.417 --> 19:11.875
I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT WORK,

19:11.917 --> 19:14.875
AND MY MOTHER CUT ME OFF
WITH A SMILE, AND SHE SAID,

19:14.917 --> 19:18.166
"WHY DIDN'T YOU BECOME A LAWYER
LIKE YOUR COUSIN TRUDY?"

19:18.208 --> 19:20.375
AND THE WAY SHE SAID IT,

19:20.417 --> 19:23.417
PETE, I SWEAR, I...

19:23.458 --> 19:26.417
I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH EATING.
I JUST WALKED OUT THE DOOR.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.625
I THOUGHT TRUDY WAS A TEACHER.
SHE IS.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.041
SHE PRACTICED LAW FOR TWO YEARS,
AND THEN SHE QUIT,

19:31.083 --> 19:33.625
WHICH IS A FACT MY MOTHER
IS WELL-AWARE OF.

19:33.667 --> 19:35.625
(chuckles) OKAY,
I GET IT VIOLET.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.709
NOBODY PUSHES OUR BUTTONS
LIKE FAMILY.
(mouth full)
AND WHEN THEY DO,

19:37.750 --> 19:39.709
IT EVAPORATES EVERY OUNCE
OF MATURITY WE HAVE,

19:39.750 --> 19:44.041
AND WE ARE LEFT TO BE
STUBBORN, ANGRY 12 YEAR OLDS.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.834
ARE YOU TELLING ME
TO GROW UP?
(laughs) NO.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.208
(normal voice) I'M... SAYING

19:48.250 --> 19:51.041
THAT YOU COULD HEAL
YOUR 12 YEAR OLD

19:51.083 --> 19:52.625
BY FORGIVING FRANCES

19:52.667 --> 19:54.667
FOR ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS
THAT SHE DID.

19:54.709 --> 19:58.041
SHE KNOWS SHE FAILED YOU.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING
OF THE KIND.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.041
I TALKED TO HER, PETE.

20:04.083 --> 20:05.458
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.792
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY HUSBAND.

20:07.834 --> 20:11.166
BECAUSE KNOWING EVEN JUST
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HER

20:11.208 --> 20:13.959
AND YOUR PAST HELPS ME
TO UNDERSTAND YOU BETTER.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.250
I KNOW THAT THIS IS HARD--
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE PEACE
WITH SOME PARENTS,

20:17.291 --> 20:20.375
WHY DON'T YOU START
WITH YOUR OWN?

20:20.417 --> 20:23.792
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU MAKE
SO MUCH AS A PHONE CALL.
YES, YES, I--IT'S TRUE. I AM
ASKING YOU TO DO SOME WORK THAT

20:23.834 --> 20:26.792
I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO DO
ON MY OWN, BUT JUST BECAUSE

20:26.834 --> 20:29.166
THAT SEEMS UNFAIR
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I AM WRONG.

20:29.208 --> 20:31.166
IF YOU ARE ABLE
TO FORGIVE FRANCES,

20:31.208 --> 20:34.000
SHE WON'T BE ABLE
TO CONTROL YOU ANYMORE.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.250
SHE IS WHO SHE IS,
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE,

20:36.291 --> 20:38.250
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT'S IMPORTANT

20:38.291 --> 20:40.041
IS HOW YOU MOVE FORWARD.

20:40.083 --> 20:43.041
BUT THAT'S UP TO YOU.

20:43.083 --> 20:45.041
(sighs)

20:45.083 --> 20:47.041
(knocks on doorjamb)
I TALKED TO PATRICK.

20:47.083 --> 20:49.667
AND?
HE WANTS THE AWAKE CRANIOTOMY
BECAUSE HE THINKS

20:49.709 --> 20:51.667
HIS GRANDFATHER
WON'T LOVE HIM ANYMORE

20:51.709 --> 20:54.625
IF HE CAN'T PLAY THE PIANO.
THE GRANDFATHER TOLD HIM
TO GET THE SAFER SURGERY.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.417
A SMART KID CAN ALWAYS FEEL
THE TRUTH BEHIND THE WORDS,

20:57.458 --> 20:59.417
AND NOW HE IS MAKING
A LIFE-OR-DEATH DECISION

20:59.458 --> 21:02.250
BASED ON FEAR THAT--
LOTS OF PEOPLE DO.

21:02.291 --> 21:04.041
THIS IS JUST WRONG.

21:04.083 --> 21:06.875
COOPER, DENNIS HAS RAISED
THIS KID BY HIMSELF

21:06.917 --> 21:09.041
FOR, WHAT, LIKE TEN YEARS?
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT--

21:09.083 --> 21:12.041
THEIR RELATIONSHIP
CAN'T BE THAT TENUOUS.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.500
LOOK, I KNOW SEEING ME
WITH MARLA WAS A SHOCK,

21:14.542 --> 21:17.041
AND I KNOW YOU TWO GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT,

21:17.083 --> 21:19.500
BUT IF YOU GIVE HER A CHANCE,
I THINK YOU'LL SEE

21:19.542 --> 21:22.041
THAT SHE'S REALLY KIND OF
AN AMAZING PERSON, YOU--
SHE'S A BITCH.

21:22.083 --> 21:24.041
OKAY, LOOK, SHE DIDN'T LIKE
YOUR BOOK.
SHE SAVAGED ME, SHELDON.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.041
DOES THE ENTIRE WORLD
NEED TO BE IN LOVE WITH YOU?

21:26.083 --> 21:28.333
ARE YOU REALLY THAT INSECURE?
YOU KNOW, SHELDON, MY PLATE

21:28.375 --> 21:30.333
IS KIND OF FULL RIGHT NOW
WITH PETE AND HIS MOTHER

21:30.375 --> 21:32.041
AND TEENAGERS
RUINING THEIR LIVES.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.750
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS CRAP. HELLO.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.125
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

21:36.166 --> 21:38.709
OKAY, WELL, UM, THIS IS
THE NURSERY, OBVIOUSLY.

21:38.750 --> 21:41.041
SO AFTER YOUR BABIES ARE BORN,
THEY'LL BE BROUGHT HERE

21:41.083 --> 21:43.041
TO GET CLEANED UP
AND GET SOME TESTS DONE.

21:43.083 --> 21:45.041
UNLESS THEY'RE, YOU KNOW,
CUT OUT OF YOU.

21:45.083 --> 21:47.041
WE'VE ALL READ IT.
AND AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR,

21:47.083 --> 21:50.041
THEY'LL BE BROUGHT TO YOUR ROOM
SO THAT YOU CAN NURSE.

21:50.083 --> 21:53.041
DID IT HURT WHEN THE CRAZY LADY
CUT IT OUT OF YOU?
OKAY, AGAIN, THIS IS NOT
ABOUT DR. TURNER.

21:53.083 --> 21:56.959
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND HOW
YOUR LIVES ARE GONNA CHANGE.
OKAY, THAT IS NOT FAIR.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.667
SHE'S TELLING US WE'RE TOTAL
SCREWUPS, BUT IN REALITY--
NO ONE IS SAYING THAT.

22:00.709 --> 22:02.709
HELLO. WERE YOU COMPLETELY
TUNED OUT YESTERDAY?

22:02.750 --> 22:05.792
SHE SMUSHED WITH, LIKE, TWO GUYS
AND DIDN'T EVEN USE PROTECTION.

22:05.834 --> 22:08.125
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
WHO THE DAD IS.
SHE IS RIGHT HERE.

22:08.166 --> 22:10.625
WHATEVER. YOU DIDN'T EVEN
WANT YOUR KID.

22:10.667 --> 22:13.417
AT LEAST WE WANT OUR BABIES.
OH, GETTING PREGNANT
FOR STATUS OR TO GET LOVE,

22:13.458 --> 22:15.417
THAT IS SELFISH AND IMMATURE.

22:15.458 --> 22:18.333
VIOLET, THAT'S ENOUGH.
NO, NO, SHELDON.
I WANT TO HELP THESE GIRLS,

22:18.375 --> 22:21.208
BUT I'M NOT GONNA STAND HERE
AND BE ABUSED.
OKAY, PLEASE, JUST LEAVE.

22:21.250 --> 22:23.208
OH! OHH! AH! AH!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:23.250 --> 22:25.834
IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING'S
TEARING INSIDE ME. AAH!

22:25.875 --> 22:28.166
WE NEED A GURNEY HERE!
LISA, CALL CASEY'S MOM.

22:28.208 --> 22:30.625
NO, NO, I DON'T NEED HER.
JUST LISA.

22:30.667 --> 22:33.792
AH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?
OKAY, OKAY,
YOU ARE BLEEDING INSIDE,

22:33.834 --> 22:38.000
YOUR BABY IS IN DANGER, AND IT
NEEDS TO COME OUT RIGHT NOW.
AH! AH!

22:40.959 --> 22:45.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:45.083 --> 22:47.375
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

22:47.417 --> 22:50.041
THE DELIVERY
ISN'T THE HARD PART.

22:50.083 --> 22:51.417
THE PAIN IS FLEETING.

22:51.458 --> 22:55.792
IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY
THAT'S FOREVER.
(baby cries)

22:55.834 --> 22:59.041
THIS ISN'T WHAT I EXPECTED.
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT CASEY.

22:59.083 --> 23:02.041
THIS IS TOO MUCH.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

23:02.083 --> 23:04.250
I'M HERE FOR YOU, AND WE'LL--
WE'LL KEEP WORKING.

23:04.291 --> 23:08.125
NO. I CAN'T DO THIS.

23:08.166 --> 23:11.417
(baby crying)

23:13.083 --> 23:16.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

23:16.083 --> 23:19.000
(people speaking indistinctly)

23:21.291 --> 23:24.208
(knocks on window)

23:24.250 --> 23:26.208
IS THAT LUCAS?

23:36.083 --> 23:39.458
I USED TO THINK
IT WAS MY FAULT.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.041
IF I WAS A BETTER KID,
THAT YOU WOULDN'T DRINK.

23:42.083 --> 23:45.458
IF I WAS A GOOD SON, THAT MAYBE
ONE OF THE GUYS YOU BROUGHT HOME

23:45.500 --> 23:48.458
WOULD HANG AROUND
FOR MORE THAN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.959
BUT... BUT THEN I HAD LUCAS,
AND...

23:51.000 --> 23:53.041
(chuckles)

23:53.083 --> 23:55.500
THE LOVE I FEEL FOR HIM,
IT JUST...

23:55.542 --> 23:57.500
CHANGED EVERYTHING.

23:59.542 --> 24:02.667
HOW COULD YOU NOT FEEL THAT
FOR ADAM AND ME?

24:02.709 --> 24:04.959
I-I WAS DRUNK
MOST OF THE TIME.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.750
THEN THERE WERE DRUGS.

24:06.792 --> 24:08.834
YOU KNOW, AFTER A WHILE,

24:08.875 --> 24:12.291
THE PERSON YOU ARE...
IS JUST GONE.

24:15.083 --> 24:18.458
PETE, I'M SO SORRY.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.458
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.041
MAYBE I CAN'T.

24:24.083 --> 24:27.125
BUT I LOVE YOU.

24:30.166 --> 24:33.083
IS IT TOO LATE
TO START OVER?

24:35.792 --> 24:38.083
LUCAS, THIS IS FRANCES.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.041
SHE'S YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

24:42.083 --> 24:44.041
HI. YOU ARE A BIG BOY.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.041
'IGHT.
HE LOOKS LIKE YOU.

24:47.083 --> 24:49.250
HELLO.

24:49.291 --> 24:50.458
MM.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.041
YEAH.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.667
(knock on door)

24:53.709 --> 24:56.208
PETE, GOT A SECOND?

25:03.750 --> 25:05.709
SO I LOOKED AT THE ECHO,

25:05.750 --> 25:09.083
AND THE DAMAGE TO HER HEART
IS PRETTY EXTENSIVE.

25:09.125 --> 25:11.709
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO,
PETE. I'M SORRY.

25:11.750 --> 25:13.500
MAMA?

25:13.542 --> 25:15.041
HOW LONG?

25:15.083 --> 25:17.041
WELL, SHE'S IN BORDERLINE
CARDIOGENIC SHOCK.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.208
SHE'S NOT RESPONDING--
SAM, HOW LONG?

25:19.250 --> 25:21.625
NOT LONG.

25:28.250 --> 25:31.041
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

25:31.083 --> 25:33.458
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT PATRICK.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.667
I ASSUMED.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.458
HE NEEDS TO HAVE SURGERY.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.041
EITHER SURGERY,
BUT HE NEEDS TO HAVE ONE.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.041
SO YOU TWO NEED TO MAKE
A DECISION,

25:43.083 --> 25:46.041
BECAUSE HIS TUMOR
IS GONNA KEEP GROWING AND...

25:46.083 --> 25:48.667
DO YOU LOVE HIM?

25:48.709 --> 25:50.834
YOU HAVE TO LOVE HIM.

25:50.875 --> 25:53.875
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T SAY IT
DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T FEEL IT

25:53.917 --> 25:57.041
OR THAT PATRICK
DOESN'T KNOW IT.
HE DOESN'T KNOW IT.

25:57.083 --> 25:59.041
I MEAN, CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?
HE IS TERRIFIED

25:59.083 --> 26:01.542
THAT HIS ONLY CONNECTION
TO YOU IS THROUGH MUSIC.

26:01.583 --> 26:03.500
HE IS WILLING
TO PARALYZE HIMSELF

26:03.542 --> 26:06.041
BECAUSE HE IS AFRAID
THAT WITHOUT PIANO,

26:06.083 --> 26:08.417
YOU WON'T CONNECT ANYMORE.

26:08.458 --> 26:11.041
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM
THAT YOU LOVE HIM.

26:11.083 --> 26:13.041
YOU HAVE TO SAY THE WORDS,

26:13.083 --> 26:15.583
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T AND WE
ARE NOT ABLE TO DO SOMETHING,

26:15.625 --> 26:18.000
HE IS GONNA DIE.

26:18.041 --> 26:20.458
DON'T YOU DARE LECTURE ME
ABOUT DEATH.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.417
SOMEDAY YOU WILL REACH A POINT

26:22.458 --> 26:26.041
WHERE MORE OF THE PEOPLE
YOU LOVE ARE DEAD THAN ALIVE,

26:26.083 --> 26:30.041
AND THAT, DR. SHEPHERD,
IS TERRIFYING.

26:30.083 --> 26:34.792
TO LOSE YOUR WIFE...
(sighs) TO A STROKE

26:34.834 --> 26:37.208
AND THEN YOUR SON
IN A CAR ACCIDENT--

26:37.250 --> 26:39.125
I UNDERSTAND DEATH.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.667
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS WHY EVERY FEELING

26:41.709 --> 26:43.250
HAS TO BE COMMUNICATED.

26:43.291 --> 26:48.333
IF THE LOVE IS THERE,
YOU KNOW.

26:48.375 --> 26:52.333
WHEN I WAS A KID, MY DAD
WAS SHOT IN FRONT OF ME,

26:52.375 --> 26:55.250
AND WHAT HELPED ME KEEP GOING
WAS MY MOTHER.

26:55.291 --> 26:57.834
EVERY NIGHT BEFORE BED,

26:57.875 --> 26:59.834
SHE SAID, "GOOD NIGHT.
I LOVE YOU.

26:59.875 --> 27:02.834
I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW,"
AND THERE WAS NO CONFUSION.

27:02.875 --> 27:04.875
THERE WAS NO DOUBT
THAT SHE LOVED ME

27:04.917 --> 27:06.458
ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF THEM.

27:06.500 --> 27:11.250
AND THAT EVEN IN HIS ABSENCE,
SHE WOULD BE THERE, ALWAYS.

27:11.291 --> 27:13.166
PLEASE JUST TALK TO HIM.

27:15.917 --> 27:20.208
IF PATRICK WANTS THE SURGERY,
DO IT.

27:32.083 --> 27:35.041
I THOUGHT...
WHY AREN'T YOU DRESSED?

27:35.083 --> 27:38.125
I'M NOT GOING IN TODAY.

27:38.166 --> 27:39.917
YOU GONNA SEE YOUR MOTHER?

27:39.959 --> 27:42.917
MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW.

27:42.959 --> 27:44.959
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.542
SPARE ME
THE MISSED OPPORTUNITY SPEECH.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.750
THAT SHIP SAILED
A LONG TIME AGO.

27:50.792 --> 27:52.750
W-WHAT, SO YOU'RE GONNA
WALK AWAY NOW?

27:52.792 --> 27:55.542
LOOK, I DIDN'T GET
THE MOTHER I WANTED.

27:55.583 --> 27:57.709
I DIDN'T GET THE MOTHER
I DESERVED,

27:57.750 --> 28:00.792
AND IT MADE ME SO ANGRY...
I WANTED HER TO DIE.

28:00.834 --> 28:03.041
I WISHED FOR IT.

28:03.083 --> 28:05.583
BUT YESTERDAY,
FOR A FEW MINUTES,

28:05.625 --> 28:07.041
IT WAS LIKE...

28:07.083 --> 28:09.709
HER DEATH
WOULD'VE BEEN EASIER BEFORE,

28:09.750 --> 28:12.083
BUT NOW IT'S...

28:12.125 --> 28:13.709
(sighs)

28:13.750 --> 28:15.333
NOW IT'S GONNA HURT

28:15.375 --> 28:17.333
BECAUSE YOU HAD A GLIMPSE

28:17.375 --> 28:19.333
OF WHAT COULD'VE BEEN
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU

28:19.375 --> 28:21.625
IF THINGS WERE DIFFERENT.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.542
(sighs deeply)

28:23.583 --> 28:25.750
(inhales and exhales deeply)

28:25.792 --> 28:28.041
I'M SORRY, PETE.
IT'S GONNA HURT.

28:28.083 --> 28:30.041
I MEAN, THERE'S JUST NO WAY
AROUND IT.

28:30.083 --> 28:33.041
YOU JUST
GOTTA GET THROUGH IT.

28:33.083 --> 28:34.041
(sighs)

28:34.083 --> 28:36.125
BUT MAYBE THIS PAIN
IS GOOD...

28:36.166 --> 28:39.875
BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT
SOMEWHERE INSIDE OF YOU

28:39.917 --> 28:41.875
YOU STILL WANT TO CONNECT
WITH FRANCES,

28:41.917 --> 28:43.959
AND NOW SHE WANTS THAT, TOO.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.875
I MEAN, HAS IT COME
DECADES TOO LATE?

28:47.917 --> 28:51.041
YEAH... (laughs) BUT...

28:53.625 --> 28:56.583
BUT MAYBE THOSE PATIENTS
THAT YOU COMFORTED

28:56.625 --> 28:58.667
WHILE THEY DIED,

28:58.709 --> 29:03.000
MAYBE THEY WERE JUST PRACTICE
FOR HELPING YOUR MOTHER...

29:04.917 --> 29:09.542
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.458
YOU THINK HE'S COMING?
I DON'T KNOW, COOPER.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.875
BUT HE MIGHT.

29:17.917 --> 29:20.917
HEY. YOU READY?

29:20.959 --> 29:23.667
MY GRANDFATHER'S
NOT GONNA SHOW, DR. FREEDMAN.

29:23.709 --> 29:27.291
I TOLD YOU, HE'S ONLY
INTERESTED IN ME IF I CAN PLAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T I GOWN UP?

29:27.333 --> 29:30.250
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GO IN THERE ALONE.
I WON'T BE.

29:30.291 --> 29:33.041
I'VE GOT DR. SHEPHERD.
OKAY.

29:39.250 --> 29:42.208
