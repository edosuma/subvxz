WEBVTT

01:22.383 --> 01:23.517
Ahh!

01:40.867 --> 01:45.004
Better come out, or else...

01:49.310 --> 01:52.879
I will kill each soul
that you swore to protect.

01:55.749 --> 01:56.849
I'm going out there.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.420
They know I'm here,

01:59.553 --> 02:01.322
and they'll find us
sooner than later.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.225
I don't want anyone else
killed for my sake.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.727
Okay?

02:15.436 --> 02:16.437
One.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.225
It's finally here.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.727
What is?

04:55.094 --> 04:56.563
Taking that bold
step of Aquarius.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.999
Someone with a higher rank
and a new commander in -

05:01.735 --> 05:03.537
Well,
never thought of it that way.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.741
Well, that was always
to be expected.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.108
And I'm ready.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.012
My chicken days are over,
boys.

05:13.145 --> 05:14.481
Rooster now.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.015
Well, I'm a rooster,
all right.

05:16.148 --> 05:19.118
Yeah.
But my fear is beyond that.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.655
That I always have this fear

05:21.788 --> 05:25.726
of not always being around,
you know?

05:29.296 --> 05:31.331
Well, I...

05:31.465 --> 05:33.800
I would just like for you both
to make me a promise.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.772
Daddy, you'll hold my hand
if I am ever down.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.072
Hey. Hey, hey.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.241
We don't need this energy.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.442
It's a wedding day. All right?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.110
That's not
what I was talking about.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.512
That's not what I meant.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.713
I'm serious.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.350
I don't want to hear this.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.319
We are all going to stand

05:52.452 --> 05:54.053
with each other
to the very end.

05:54.186 --> 05:55.222
Yeah.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.423
We fall and rise together.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.959
No, we rise,
we rise together.

05:59.091 --> 06:01.628
Doing bad things
to bad people.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.232
We rise and we rise together.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.600
- Yeah.
- Yo.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.404
- Now we'll escort you.
- Let's go, let's go.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.471
Okay.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.105
I can't see everybody
in my shorts.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.108
Say cheese.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.109
Cheese!

06:17.244 --> 06:18.512
Really?

06:20.112 --> 06:22.215
Okay. That' all right.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.383
I have to...

06:23.517 --> 06:25.619
Okay, let's see that.

07:04.558 --> 07:07.461
Prepare to draw sword!

07:08.762 --> 07:10.864
Draw swords!

07:33.820 --> 07:36.423
For the bride and groom,

07:37.891 --> 07:39.926
cross swords.

08:49.830 --> 08:50.564
Congratulations.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.798
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.238
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.343
So on behalf
of the Nigerian Air Force

09:03.477 --> 09:05.545
Officers Wives' Association,

09:05.679 --> 09:08.415
I want to welcome you
officially to the association.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.883
Thank you, Ma.

09:10.016 --> 09:13.520
Here, we stand by our men

09:13.653 --> 09:15.322
and our children
when they come,

09:16.490 --> 09:20.260
while our men stand
for our country.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.596
So on behalf of...

09:24.131 --> 09:25.699
of the association,

09:27.033 --> 09:29.169
I want to give you this
as a token of our love.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.370
Thank you very much.

09:30.504 --> 09:31.738
Thank you, Ma.
Thank you very much.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.886
<i>The insurgent
have struck in the markets</i>

12:00.020 --> 12:02.722
<i>in a multiple bomb blasts,
killing over 90 people,</i>

12:02.856 --> 12:04.358
<i>including women and children</i>

12:04.491 --> 12:08.628
<i>and another city of Maiduguri,

12:08.762 --> 12:10.664
<i>The president
and some other service chiefs</i>

12:10.797 --> 12:11.965
<i>will order security...</i>

12:12.098 --> 12:13.099
What is happening?

12:16.603 --> 12:17.837
This morning?

12:17.971 --> 12:19.639
Just now,
all your guys have been

12:19.773 --> 12:20.941
summoned to the villa.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.112
This does not smell good.

12:28.349 --> 12:29.749
What does that mean?

12:33.354 --> 12:34.955
Come on, it's nothing.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.556
Don't worry,
I don't mean to scare you.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.161
Oh, okay.

12:41.295 --> 12:42.896
<i>- Don't worry, okay?
- My son is dead.</i>

12:44.265 --> 12:45.732
Please.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.001
<i>This enemy is not fighting
a conventional war.</i>

12:50.003 --> 12:53.106
Your Excellency, sir,
with all due respect,

12:53.240 --> 12:54.641
the army is holding forth.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.144
It is time the air force
roll outs

12:58.279 --> 13:00.080
and take this enemy out.

13:00.214 --> 13:03.149
Sir, be mindful that

13:03.284 --> 13:06.619
these people have held
our people hostage.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.255
Do we use them
as you mentioned?

13:09.923 --> 13:12.125
What do you suggest
we do now?

13:12.259 --> 13:14.295
They are taking over
territories,

13:14.428 --> 13:15.662
and that is not acceptable.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.967
Your Excellency, sir,
we will deploy more troops

13:21.101 --> 13:24.070
and embark on intelligence
gathering.

13:25.373 --> 13:27.907
Mr. President, sir,

13:28.041 --> 13:31.445
our intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance platform

13:31.578 --> 13:34.080
will point the army
to the location.

13:34.215 --> 13:36.484
Meanwhile, we will carry out
sort of strikes

13:36.616 --> 13:37.884
to pave the way
for the ground troops

13:38.018 --> 13:40.221
to come in and recover those
territories.

13:41.788 --> 13:45.025
Whatever information
from our end will be shared

13:45.158 --> 13:48.762
with you all for a more
coordinated operation.

13:50.297 --> 13:54.534
Well, in that case,
what are we waiting for?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.203
You have my approval.

13:56.337 --> 13:57.570
Let's go and get them.

14:04.245 --> 14:05.379
Here.

14:05.513 --> 14:06.713
Thanks.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.048
You're welcome.

14:18.925 --> 14:21.061
Your commander knows
you just got married, right?

14:24.331 --> 14:26.032
Sweetheart, can we,

14:26.166 --> 14:28.635
can we not just go
into this now?

14:31.338 --> 14:34.007
We had this conversation
years before marriage.

14:38.379 --> 14:41.147
I signed up for this
and you agreed to it.

14:42.982 --> 14:47.087
Sweetheart,
everything will be fine, okay?

14:51.091 --> 14:52.992
I'm trained for moments
like this.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.629
Okay?

14:56.763 --> 14:58.198
Nothing's going
to happen to me, okay?

14:58.332 --> 14:59.366
Cheer up.

15:00.568 --> 15:01.734
Okay.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.206
I'll come back as always.

15:08.342 --> 15:09.376
Okay.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.125
Gentlemen, the Chief.

16:04.465 --> 16:05.999
Gentlemen, please be seated.

16:13.307 --> 16:14.308
Good morning.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.842
Good morning, sir.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.847
You all know what is at hand.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.286
Our mandate is crystal.

16:25.419 --> 16:26.753
So we're going to do
everything

16:26.886 --> 16:28.855
we can to support
the army fight

16:28.988 --> 16:30.089
this common enemy.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.193
Our nation needs us.

16:33.327 --> 16:36.863
Our people are depending on us
destroying them.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.270
This call is an answer
to the mandates to be -

16:45.838 --> 16:47.274
Do I make myself clear?

16:47.408 --> 16:48.409
Yes, sir.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.146
Come.

17:05.191 --> 17:10.397
The ground troops
are counting on us

17:10.531 --> 17:11.798
to soften their ground.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.236
As the chief always say,

17:15.369 --> 17:17.538
in the race to add value
to our society

17:17.671 --> 17:19.707
and secure our communities,

17:19.839 --> 17:21.908
there's no finishing line, sir.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.410
So I assure you

17:23.544 --> 17:26.079
that we do everything
humanly possible

17:26.213 --> 17:27.514
to deliver on this mission, sir.

17:28.781 --> 17:32.185
The service is counting on you.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.052
Yes, sir.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.521
That will be all for now.

17:40.159 --> 17:42.429
Do have a safe flight
on your way back.

17:42.563 --> 17:43.930
Thank you, sir.

18:10.524 --> 18:11.558
Everyone, the commander.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.261
Good morning, gentleman.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.107
Good morning, sir.

18:30.444 --> 18:33.580
The commander -
officers, officers.

18:33.714 --> 18:34.981
Standby for timeout.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.253
One-zero.

18:43.324 --> 18:47.960
Five, four, three, two, one.

18:49.263 --> 18:51.864
Your time now 07:00 UTC.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.337
Shall we all rise
for the national prayer?

18:59.072 --> 19:00.374
Let us pray.

19:02.776 --> 19:07.581
Oh God of creation,
direct our noble cause.

19:07.715 --> 19:10.183
Guide our leaders right,

19:10.317 --> 19:12.353
help our youths
the truth to know.

19:13.253 --> 19:17.324
In love and honesty to grow

<i>Amen.</i>

19:48.955 --> 19:51.090
Gentlemen,
our mission is clear.

19:51.225 --> 19:53.126
Although we have to wait
on the ISR

19:53.260 --> 19:55.027
to give us information
on human activities

19:55.161 --> 19:58.499
around the target,
let us make our country proud.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.534
Yes, sir. Let's go.

20:32.666 --> 20:33.966
<i>Copy from Shadow.</i>

20:35.436 --> 20:38.037

20:38.171 --> 20:41.442
Aggressor 2
will maintain level 120.

20:41.575 --> 20:45.077
Shadow, maintain level 160
and provide -

20:45.212 --> 20:46.346
After attack,

20:46.480 --> 20:49.483
proceed to sector Alpha
for retrain.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.585
Aggressor 2 have to cut out
you on attack.

20:51.718 --> 20:55.021
Get after I retrain
forward movement, please.

<i>Target is taken out.</i>

21:23.951 --> 21:25.985
<i>Enemy has been neutralized.</i>

21:26.118 --> 21:28.054
Good job, guys.

21:28.187 --> 21:30.122
Return to base immediately.

21:30.257 --> 21:31.558
The ground troops
will take it from there.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.261
Yes!

21:47.006 --> 21:47.908
Okay.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.376
Yeah.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.394
Excuse me.

22:09.730 --> 22:11.063
Hello, baby.

22:12.232 --> 22:13.734
So, how was work today?

22:13.867 --> 22:15.536
Fine.

22:15.669 --> 22:16.870
Okay.

22:17.004 --> 22:20.240
So I have an announcement
to make.

22:22.342 --> 22:23.443
Baby, are you pregnant?

22:25.612 --> 22:27.681
I guess that's the only thing
on your mind.

22:27.814 --> 22:30.350
Of course, I know
what I did before I left.

22:30.484 --> 22:32.686
Well, it's not fun anymore.

22:34.254 --> 22:35.355
So, are you pregnant?

22:36.823 --> 22:38.025
Yes, Mr. Dibia.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.125
Yes!

22:39.259 --> 22:40.460
Babe, when did you find out?

22:41.628 --> 22:42.362
Yesterday.

22:42.496 --> 22:44.130
But I didn't want you to have

22:44.264 --> 22:46.366
any distraction
going on the mission.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.304
I love you, baby.
This is good news.

22:51.672 --> 22:52.639
I love you, too.

23:01.515 --> 23:04.551
If it's a boy,
you will name him after me.

23:05.819 --> 23:06.687
That's my first son.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.288
Why should I name him
after you?

23:08.422 --> 23:10.324
Because I'm your friend.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.960
What you need to do
is get married, huh?

23:13.092 --> 23:14.193
It doesn't kill.

23:14.328 --> 23:16.095
We're not doing this again.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.297
I'm not ready.

23:17.431 --> 23:18.565
Don't you stop me.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.235
I'm naming my first son
after you.

24:15.322 --> 24:16.556
<i>As you are aware,</i>

24:16.690 --> 24:19.926
<i>we have conducted
several surgeries</i>

24:20.060 --> 24:21.561
<i>on the IDPs.</i>

24:21.695 --> 24:24.064
<i>There was the case of this woman
who was completely blind.</i>

24:24.196 --> 24:27.367
<i>She has had her own eyes
completely restored now.</i>

24:27.501 --> 24:28.669
<i>So we'll keep fighting</i>

24:28.802 --> 24:30.037
<i>to restore peace in
the communities.</i>

24:30.169 --> 24:31.104
<i>And as we do that,</i>

24:31.238 --> 24:32.572
<i>we will try as much as possible</i>

24:32.706 --> 24:35.475
<i>to improve
the daily living conditions</i>

24:35.609 --> 24:37.644
<i>now that they are IDPs.</i>

24:37.778 --> 24:38.845
These guys will be back,
though.

24:40.447 --> 24:42.049
We won't either.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.350
That's okay.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.053
What up, P?

24:46.185 --> 24:47.454
No, no.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.657
Easy with it.

24:50.791 --> 24:51.692
I did.

24:53.226 --> 24:54.494
Mission accomplished.

24:54.628 --> 24:55.862
Yeah.

24:55.996 --> 24:58.465
We've managed to clear the area,

24:58.598 --> 25:00.500
although we're still keeping
an eye on it.

25:00.634 --> 25:03.370
You know, the way
these guys think baffles me.

25:03.503 --> 25:05.038
Who exactly are they fighting?

25:05.172 --> 25:08.208
Everyone who is not in support
of their business

25:08.341 --> 25:09.810
or ideology is an enemy.

25:09.943 --> 25:12.979
Guys, you need to go
and see the women and children

25:13.113 --> 25:14.881
suffering the brunt of this.

25:15.015 --> 25:17.084
You know, you need
to get on the ground and see

25:17.217 --> 25:18.118
what's going on.

25:18.251 --> 25:19.886
It's a mess. It's tragic.

25:21.254 --> 25:22.422
Big mess.

25:35.268 --> 25:36.603
Morning, officer.

25:36.737 --> 25:38.305
Hey, stop here.
Wait, wait, wait.

25:38.438 --> 25:39.639
You don't know this guy.

25:39.773 --> 25:43.243
That guy were doctors
from headquarters -

25:43.376 --> 25:45.178
My mom, is she okay?

25:45.312 --> 25:46.580
Go.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.014
What happened to her?

29:00.341 --> 29:04.544
General, hold on, last card.

29:04.678 --> 29:06.179
Big two, Jack up.

29:09.317 --> 29:10.318
Hey!

29:10.450 --> 29:11.685
Oh, sorry.

32:07.328 --> 32:08.262
Hello.

32:08.395 --> 32:10.630
How's my angle
doing with my seed?

32:10.763 --> 32:12.065
Very well, sweet.

32:13.733 --> 32:14.968
Honey, I couldn't get a pass.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.636
We're still here on standby.

32:16.769 --> 32:18.705
Oh, no, no.

32:18.838 --> 32:20.907
Come on, honey, don't start.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.276
Well, you know
I have seniors here

32:22.409 --> 32:23.511
who are married, too.

32:23.643 --> 32:25.613
Well, I just stopped at market
to buy ingredients

32:25.745 --> 32:29.149
for your favorite soup,
because you promised to come.

32:29.283 --> 32:30.917
Oh, sweetie,
sweetie, sweetie.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.152
You know how the job is.

32:32.286 --> 32:33.254
You know what?

32:33.387 --> 32:34.588
I'll be back before
you know it, okay?

32:34.754 --> 32:35.722
Make sure you keep that soup.

32:35.855 --> 32:38.057
Make sure you keep my soup,
huh?

32:38.191 --> 32:40.361
Nothing in the world is going
to stop me from eating it.

32:40.494 --> 32:41.828
I promise.

32:41.961 --> 32:45.131
You promise again,
every time.

32:47.268 --> 32:48.435
I love you.

32:48.569 --> 32:49.869
<i>I love you more.</i>

32:58.212 --> 32:59.045
Sir.

32:59.179 --> 33:00.447
Good morning, gentlemen.
Sit down.

33:05.619 --> 33:06.920
The enemy is still out there.

33:09.022 --> 33:10.823
And you wonder
why we're always calling you

33:10.957 --> 33:12.125
for this kind of mission.

33:13.594 --> 33:14.794
You're a tag team.

33:15.728 --> 33:16.930
He's your ultimate.

33:18.399 --> 33:19.600
This compliment
is from the Chief

33:19.732 --> 33:20.934
of the Air Staff himself.

33:22.035 --> 33:23.370
Thank you very much, sir.

33:23.504 --> 33:27.208
Gentlemen, the jets are being
prepared for the mission.

33:27.341 --> 33:30.176
Go out there
and make us proud.

33:30.311 --> 33:32.145
Will do, sir.

33:32.279 --> 33:35.382
Our families and the nation
is counting on us.

33:36.684 --> 33:38.084
And I am counting
on you guys.

33:39.620 --> 33:40.787
We'll make you proud, sir.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.991
That'll be all for now.

33:45.124 --> 33:48.127
I wish you safe landing
when you return.

33:48.262 --> 33:49.829
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

33:53.032 --> 33:54.734
Permission to carry on, sir.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.203
Carry on.

34:33.407 --> 34:35.442
A gracious formation
of two fighter jets,

34:35.576 --> 34:39.413
two souls onboard
with registration 341, 344.

34:39.546 --> 34:42.516
Not this time for lineup,
for departure.

34:42.650 --> 34:44.551
Ops area level 150.

34:46.919 --> 34:48.689
<i>This is tower control.</i>

34:55.696 --> 34:58.931
<i>You're cleared to land -</i>

Aggressor, tower emergency.

35:47.448 --> 35:48.749
Mayday, mayday.

35:48.881 --> 35:51.385
Aggressor, tower emergency.

35:51.518 --> 35:52.952
<i>Aggressor,
this is tower control.</i>

35:53.086 --> 35:54.254
<i>State your emergency.</i>

35:59.192 --> 36:00.126
I am losing altitude.

36:00.260 --> 36:01.662
I am losing speed.

36:01.795 --> 36:04.097
My aircraft seems
to departing to a close line.

36:04.231 --> 36:06.533
Aggressor lead, this is two.

36:06.667 --> 36:07.534
How are you inside?

36:07.668 --> 36:08.802
What is your intension?

36:08.935 --> 36:11.372
Aggressor lead,
this is Shadow.

36:11.505 --> 36:12.573

aggressor lead.

37:22.074 --> 37:23.976
Welcome back.

37:24.110 --> 37:25.579
Thank you, sir.

37:26.547 --> 37:29.982
I saw his jets go down,
but I didn't spot him eject.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.689
The rescue team is already
on their way to find him

37:35.823 --> 37:36.989
and recover him.

37:37.990 --> 37:39.226
Don't worry. We'll find him.

37:39.359 --> 37:40.494
We'll get him back.

37:41.662 --> 37:42.563
Be strong.

37:42.696 --> 37:43.831
Yes, sir.

37:43.963 --> 37:45.965
Meanwhile,
the medic will check you.

37:46.098 --> 37:47.868
It's a standard routine.
You know that.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.403
- Yes, sir.
- Be strong.

39:20.394 --> 39:21.895
Well, now, gentlemen,

39:22.029 --> 39:24.831
we've now positively identified
the crashsite of the pilot.

39:24.965 --> 39:26.233
Wreckage team, move forward.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.222
Hello, Zero Alpha,

40:22.356 --> 40:24.558

40:33.300 --> 40:34.768

Be informed,
I have a positive identification

41:52.379 --> 41:54.247

41:54.381 --> 41:57.117
Pilot still not in sight.

41:57.250 --> 41:58.618
<i>Copy.</i>

41:58.752 --> 42:03.857
Pilot parachute
is on grid reference 374-412.

42:03.990 --> 42:07.561
I repeat 374-412.

45:07.540 --> 45:08.742
Get me the map.

45:21.187 --> 45:22.290

45:46.079 --> 45:48.382
and gunshot wound

45:48.515 --> 45:52.519
Special equipment required,

45:52.652 --> 45:54.754
Helicopter landing site

45:54.888 --> 45:58.191
Helicopter landing site
as we marked with blue smoke.

45:58.326 --> 45:59.526
Approach with caution.

45:59.659 --> 46:01.895
Likely enemy vicinity.

46:02.028 --> 46:02.862
Roger out.

46:55.949 --> 46:57.650
Commander, commander.

48:17.063 --> 48:18.832
<i>A preliminary report

<i>that he will do

48:34.180 --> 48:36.217

48:37.418 --> 48:38.985
<i>During the operation,</i>

48:39.119 --> 48:40.554
<i>the rescue team
came under fire</i>

<i>Scores of the insurgents

Calm down.

48:53.700 --> 48:54.868
Hmm.

48:55.869 --> 48:57.238
Calm down.

49:00.407 --> 49:01.641
Yes, come in.

49:11.418 --> 49:13.220
No, no, no.

49:13.354 --> 49:15.121
Oh, my God, no.

49:15.256 --> 49:17.391
Oh, my God, no.

49:17.525 --> 49:18.626
No, no, no.

49:18.758 --> 49:19.692
No, no, no.

49:19.826 --> 49:21.127

49:21.262 --> 49:22.263
Mama.

No, no, no, no.

49:24.398 --> 49:25.899
No, Mama.

49:27.100 --> 49:28.269

We're here on behalf

of Air Task Force,

49:47.153 --> 49:48.188
to commiserate with you

49:48.322 --> 49:50.357
on the loss
of your beloved husband,

49:52.892 --> 49:55.061
the son and the father.

49:56.597 --> 49:58.932
My gallant brother warrior,

50:01.100 --> 50:05.306
who paid a supreme price
in service to our fatherland.

50:08.509 --> 50:10.877
Joseph's sacrifice
will not be in vain.

50:12.812 --> 50:16.517
We shall defeat the enemy
and restore peace

50:16.650 --> 50:18.219
to all the troubled areas.

50:19.553 --> 50:21.154
The entire Air Force family

50:21.288 --> 50:24.425
stands with you
in this painful moment.

50:25.792 --> 50:28.027
We must assure
that the Air Force

50:28.161 --> 50:30.431
will take care
of your daughter's education.

50:32.999 --> 50:34.468
In the meantime,

50:36.503 --> 50:41.508
please accept this token
for immediate expenses.

50:43.042 --> 50:44.278
Thank you, sir.

50:44.411 --> 50:48.114
As we prepare to honor
our fallen hero.

51:29.390 --> 51:31.090
Shh.

51:31.225 --> 51:33.826
Listen, I'm not going
to harm you, okay?

51:45.038 --> 51:46.440
I'm gonna
take my hand of you.

51:50.810 --> 51:52.579
Look, I'm a pilot, okay?

51:54.113 --> 51:56.717
I fly flights, flights.

51:56.849 --> 51:57.718
Fighter pilot.

51:57.850 --> 51:59.720
I fly jets, okay?

51:59.852 --> 52:02.356
I know exactly
who a pilot is.

52:04.525 --> 52:08.529
And I also know exactly
what a fighter pilot does.

52:08.662 --> 52:09.596
Great.

52:11.699 --> 52:12.965
You kill people.

52:21.608 --> 52:22.842
Hey, hey.

52:24.345 --> 52:29.082
I'm a Nigerian
Air Force officer, a pilot.

52:29.216 --> 52:31.352
Look, we are fighting for you.

52:36.122 --> 52:39.426
Please, can I,
can I get some water to drink?

52:42.161 --> 52:43.397
Just wait here.

53:37.518 --> 53:38.852
I...

53:38.985 --> 53:40.920
He's asking how you got here.

53:47.126 --> 53:48.529
I just lost my jet.

53:51.465 --> 53:53.901
A long day
and I missed frontline.

53:54.033 --> 53:55.101
Wait,
you can actually understand

53:55.235 --> 53:56.804
what he's saying.

53:56.936 --> 53:58.137
Just a bit.

54:08.549 --> 54:09.550
Around here.

54:11.150 --> 54:12.486
I'm right here.

54:12.619 --> 54:14.455
So the moment
I got back on my feet,

54:14.588 --> 54:16.790
I have to run
in the opposite direction,

54:16.924 --> 54:19.359
and that's how I find myself
in this settlement.

54:33.807 --> 54:35.107
That...

54:35.242 --> 54:37.277
that's why the government
is trying to help you.

54:45.352 --> 54:47.387
I just lost my jet.
My jet just crashed.

54:49.723 --> 54:52.459
I put my life
on the line for you.

54:52.593 --> 54:53.961
I have a pregnant wife
at home,

54:54.093 --> 54:55.295
probably worried sick about...

54:55.429 --> 54:56.697
about my whereabouts now.

54:59.967 --> 55:02.101
I can bet you that the Air Force
is doing everything in its power

55:02.236 --> 55:03.537
to rescue me
from this situation.

55:03.670 --> 55:05.606
And the government
is doing everything

55:05.739 --> 55:07.641
to restore peace
to your communities.

55:07.774 --> 55:09.041
So please no, my brother.

55:09.175 --> 55:10.444
No, I do not agree with you.

55:20.454 --> 55:21.855
Gentlemen.
How is the morale?

55:21.989 --> 55:22.890
High, sir.

55:23.022 --> 55:24.258
Good.

55:25.425 --> 55:27.059
This is not a drill.

55:27.193 --> 55:29.530
This is a mission to search,

55:29.663 --> 55:32.733
find and recover
Wing Commodore Nura Yusuf.

55:35.569 --> 55:38.170
That one soul
is the blood of the nation.

55:39.840 --> 55:43.977
His survival
is key to our struggle.

55:44.110 --> 55:45.679
You'll be deployed in that area

55:45.812 --> 55:48.949
and you're expected
to do everything possible

55:49.081 --> 55:50.684
to get the desired result.

55:51.618 --> 55:53.554
The Chief of the Air Staff
is counting on you.

55:55.255 --> 55:56.757
Our families
are counting on you.

55:57.824 --> 55:59.793
The mission
is counting on you.

56:01.228 --> 56:02.496
Gentleman, how is the morale?

56:02.629 --> 56:03.797
High, sir!

56:04.665 --> 56:06.165
Your commander
will take it from here.

56:12.673 --> 56:14.073
I request your permission
to carry on, sir.

56:14.207 --> 56:15.342
Carry on.

56:23.917 --> 56:25.151
Easy.

56:27.119 --> 56:28.355
It's nothing new.

56:28.488 --> 56:30.156
We've done it before.
We can do it again.

56:31.325 --> 56:32.726
I know you're the best.

56:32.859 --> 56:33.994
You know you're
we're the best.

56:34.126 --> 56:35.696
They know we're the best.

56:35.829 --> 56:36.697
Right.

56:36.830 --> 56:39.032
So, let's move out
and fight like...

56:39.165 --> 56:40.367
Stand by.

56:46.105 --> 56:47.808
I believe Nura is alive.

56:47.941 --> 56:49.175
Yeah.

56:49.309 --> 56:50.644
My instinct tells me
he has gone far away

56:50.777 --> 56:53.981
from the aircraft
as a survival tactic,

56:54.113 --> 56:55.515
because the area
is a visible target.

56:56.617 --> 56:58.018
Yeah,
because he actually crashed

56:58.150 --> 56:59.853
in enemy's territory.

56:59.987 --> 57:01.688
Exactly.

57:01.822 --> 57:04.024
You know, maybe that's
why we couldn't find him

57:04.156 --> 57:05.559
in the first instance.

57:05.692 --> 57:08.127
Because he must be running away
from the enemy.

57:08.261 --> 57:09.563
Yeah.

57:09.696 --> 57:12.633
I suggest you search
in the opposite direction.

57:12.766 --> 57:16.436
The ISR unit guys
need this information also.

57:16.570 --> 57:18.405
Meanwhile,
I need to call his home.

57:18.538 --> 57:19.673
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:25.012 --> 57:26.145
Hello, madam.

57:28.682 --> 57:31.785
I'm...I'm calling to reassure
you of our commitment

57:31.918 --> 57:34.788
to bring our friend
and classmate back home.

57:34.921 --> 57:38.392
Yissa, if he's dead,
just tell me.

57:38.525 --> 57:40.727
I know him to be a survivor.

57:40.861 --> 57:41.795
<i>Yes.</i>

57:41.928 --> 57:43.730
<i>I don't want you
to lose hope.</i>

57:43.864 --> 57:48.969
Paul Dike is leading
a special operation force,

57:49.102 --> 57:50.337
and I'll be in the air.

57:52.171 --> 57:53.106
Yeah. Hold the line.

57:53.240 --> 57:54.341
He wants to talk to you.

57:58.311 --> 58:00.080
Hello, madam.
How are you doing?

58:00.213 --> 58:01.581
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

58:01.715 --> 58:05.619
Listen, you know he has
every reason to stay alive.

58:05.752 --> 58:06.920
All right.

58:07.054 --> 58:09.923
Just keep him in your prayers
and stay positive.

58:10.057 --> 58:11.625
Okay, I will.

58:11.758 --> 58:14.628
<i>Listen, Nigerian Air Force
is mobilizing everything.</i>

58:14.761 --> 58:17.798
And I started an operation
for recovery.

58:17.931 --> 58:19.132
Yissa and I are here,

58:19.266 --> 58:20.834
and we're committed
to bringing our colleague home.

58:22.469 --> 58:23.637
Thank you, Paul.

58:46.426 --> 58:47.360
She's complaining.

58:47.494 --> 58:48.395
Why are you complaining?

59:02.876 --> 59:03.910
Boys!

59:05.345 --> 59:06.279
Oh.

59:06.413 --> 59:07.948
The food is getting cold.

1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:14.741
Yes.

1:01:14.875 --> 1:01:16.977
But we can't just stand here
and wait for them

1:01:17.110 --> 1:01:17.844
to come and attack us.

1:01:17.978 --> 1:01:19.012
At least, we have to find a way

1:01:19.145 --> 1:01:21.181
to defend ourselves
if they come.

1:01:21.315 --> 1:01:24.050
We're assured the good
or the bad will come any time.

1:01:24.184 --> 1:01:26.320
Before reinforcements comes
and this will be sure

1:01:26.453 --> 1:01:27.687
that we can defend ourselves.

1:01:51.845 --> 1:01:53.381
That means
we're together with you.

1:01:53.513 --> 1:01:54.681
Okay.

1:05:03.203 --> 1:05:04.472
All right, guys.

1:05:04.604 --> 1:05:05.905
Check equipment.

1:05:13.179 --> 1:05:14.180
Check ammo.

1:05:17.451 --> 1:05:18.618
Ammo, check.

1:05:22.356 --> 1:05:23.324
Check medics.

1:05:25.191 --> 1:05:26.260
Cool.

1:05:28.496 --> 1:05:29.896
Check communications.

1:05:34.767 --> 1:05:36.169
All right. This is it.

1:05:36.303 --> 1:05:39.139
Gentlemen, we're going
to hang out here for the night.

1:05:40.073 --> 1:05:42.675
And then tomorrow morning,
we set out at 0500.

1:05:44.311 --> 1:05:45.945
We're going to search
and find out.

1:05:49.283 --> 1:05:50.284
Save your energy.

1:07:07.494 --> 1:07:08.596
Let's go. Let's go.

1:07:08.728 --> 1:07:10.163
Let's go. Let's go.

1:09:09.550 --> 1:09:10.917
General.

1:10:24.957 --> 1:10:26.326
Better come out.

1:10:28.595 --> 1:10:29.496
Or else

1:10:33.434 --> 1:10:37.003
I will kill each soldier
you swore to protect.

1:10:42.074 --> 1:10:43.377
Shh!

1:10:44.812 --> 1:10:46.045
It's me they want.

1:10:53.887 --> 1:10:55.756
I have to go out there
or they'll kill her.

1:10:55.889 --> 1:10:57.591
But, shh,
let none of you come out

1:10:57.724 --> 1:10:59.393
until you hear the sound
of the aircraft, okay?

1:11:16.910 --> 1:11:18.545
Shadow, coming from Panther.

1:11:22.850 --> 1:11:23.851
Shadow, this is Panther.

1:11:23.983 --> 1:11:25.151
Do you read me?

1:11:27.153 --> 1:11:28.020
<i>Panther, Panther,</i>

1:11:28.154 --> 1:11:29.590
<i>coming in from Shadow.</i>

1:11:29.723 --> 1:11:32.493
We just had gunshots
north of our advance position.

1:11:33.927 --> 1:11:35.929
I repeat,
we just heard gunshots

1:11:36.062 --> 1:11:37.129
north of our advance positions.

1:11:37.264 --> 1:11:38.432
Do you copy?

1:11:40.066 --> 1:11:41.702
<i>Copy. Bravo out.</i>

1:11:48.275 --> 1:11:50.042
I'm going out there. Look.

1:11:51.043 --> 1:11:52.212
They know I'm here,

1:11:52.346 --> 1:11:54.448
and they'll find us
sooner than later.

1:11:54.581 --> 1:11:56.450
I don't want anyone else
killed for my sake.

1:12:56.543 --> 1:12:57.911
One!

1:12:58.045 --> 1:12:59.580
Go back, go back.

1:13:02.816 --> 1:13:04.183
Two.

1:14:44.785 --> 1:14:45.852
Nura!

1:15:04.037 --> 1:15:05.372
Good.

1:15:05.505 --> 1:15:08.508
Gentlemen, prepare
for evacuation immediately.

1:15:09.776 --> 1:15:10.744
Roger. Over.

1:15:28.862 --> 1:15:29.963
Morning, sir.

1:15:30.097 --> 1:15:31.198
Morning.

1:15:31.331 --> 1:15:32.566
Any news?

1:15:32.699 --> 1:15:34.134
Yes, sir.

1:15:34.267 --> 1:15:35.335
I'm happy to report

1:15:35.469 --> 1:15:37.170
that we have found the pilot,
sir.

1:15:37.304 --> 1:15:38.839
Uh, uh,
and what's the situation?

1:15:38.972 --> 1:15:41.942
The asset is alive
and well, sir.

1:15:42.075 --> 1:15:43.510
<i>Oh, great.</i>

1:15:43.643 --> 1:15:46.313
The... the... the chief will be
so happy to hear this.

1:15:46.446 --> 1:15:48.415
I'm sure he will, sir.

1:15:48.548 --> 1:15:52.119
They should recover
to base immediately, okay?

1:15:52.252 --> 1:15:53.453
Will do, sir.

1:16:04.030 --> 1:16:05.233
No, no, no, no!

1:16:05.365 --> 1:16:07.267
The mission is to recover you.

1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:08.468
They're gonna deny.

1:16:08.602 --> 1:16:10.637
Let me speak
to the commander.

1:16:10.771 --> 1:16:14.141
Listen, your pregnant
wife is waiting and worried.

1:16:14.274 --> 1:16:16.309
All right, let's go now.

1:16:16.443 --> 1:16:18.578
We took an oath
to protect this nation

1:16:18.712 --> 1:16:20.881
and our people with our lives.

1:16:21.014 --> 1:16:22.516
These are the people.

1:16:22.649 --> 1:16:25.219
Don't forget your training.

1:16:25.352 --> 1:16:27.087
The commander ordered
an evacuation

1:16:27.221 --> 1:16:28.455
and that's it, all right?

1:16:28.588 --> 1:16:30.423
Listen, I made a promise

1:16:30.557 --> 1:16:32.492
that we're going
to bring you home.

1:16:32.626 --> 1:16:34.361
I want to see my wife,
all right.

1:16:34.494 --> 1:16:36.496
But first,
I have more to serve.

1:16:36.630 --> 1:16:37.864
You serve with my life.

1:16:41.701 --> 1:16:44.671
That's why we stand here,
that's why we stand together.

1:16:44.805 --> 1:16:46.339
Let me speak
to the commander.

1:16:55.849 --> 1:16:59.653
Wing Commander,
are you floating my orders?

1:16:59.786 --> 1:17:01.354
No, sir.

1:17:01.488 --> 1:17:02.589
We respect you.

1:17:03.924 --> 1:17:06.927
Make me understand.
That is 60 seconds.

1:17:07.060 --> 1:17:10.063
<i>I came in contact
with a young man, fully armed.</i>

1:17:14.134 --> 1:17:15.269
What?

1:17:15.402 --> 1:17:17.737
Sir, I think he's trying
to send a message

1:17:17.871 --> 1:17:20.407
and also a young lady
from the community

1:17:20.540 --> 1:17:22.075
was abducted
by these insurgents, sir.

1:17:25.045 --> 1:17:28.481
That singular gesture shows
that he's an ally.

1:17:30.183 --> 1:17:32.719
He and Amina must be rescued

1:17:32.853 --> 1:17:34.621
from the jaws of those
insurgents.

1:17:36.156 --> 1:17:37.490
And that's an order setup.

1:17:37.624 --> 1:17:39.260
Copied, sir.

1:17:39.392 --> 1:17:40.527
And our special forces,

1:17:40.660 --> 1:17:42.095
our trained forces
kind of mission.

1:17:46.566 --> 1:17:48.101
Also,
make the best use of them.

1:17:51.538 --> 1:17:54.941
All right, gentlemen,
the mission has changed.

1:17:55.075 --> 1:17:58.745
Secure the village and wait
for your next instruction.

1:27:04.525 --> 1:27:08.060
So how does it feel like
to eat some dust for a change?

1:27:09.663 --> 1:27:10.798
Just an elite pilot.

1:27:10.930 --> 1:27:12.198
I feel that
could've been worse.

1:27:14.066 --> 1:27:15.502
Easy.

1:27:18.806 --> 1:27:21.007
We'll do something
for these eyes, man.

1:27:22.743 --> 1:27:24.411
<i>Panther,
Panther, coming from Shadow.</i>

1:27:26.078 --> 1:27:26.946
This is Panther.

1:27:27.079 --> 1:27:28.315
You are loud, send.

1:27:30.417 --> 1:27:31.618
<i>Again, Panther, Panther,</i>

1:27:31.752 --> 1:27:32.886
<i>coming from Shadow.</i>

1:27:33.019 --> 1:27:34.488
This is Panther, you're loud.

1:27:34.621 --> 1:27:35.622
Send.

1:27:38.826 --> 1:27:40.227
<i>It's almost a flush.</i>

1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:41.728
<i>I want to look to see
where it was.</i>

1:27:43.730 --> 1:27:45.164
Roger, standing by.

1:29:16.757 --> 1:29:17.724
<i>Panther, Panther,</i>

1:29:17.858 --> 1:29:19.927
<i>from Shadow, check back.</i>

1:29:20.059 --> 1:29:20.961
Shadow, you're loud.

1:29:21.093 --> 1:29:22.362
This is Panther, send.

1:29:25.097 --> 1:29:26.633
<i>Panther, Panther, from Shadow.</i>

1:29:27.801 --> 1:29:30.337
This is Panther,
you're loud, send.

1:29:32.739 --> 1:29:33.707
<i>I have the location</i>

1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:35.008
<i>of the insurgents.</i>

1:29:35.141 --> 1:29:37.544
<i>I say again, I have the location
of the insurgents,</i>

1:29:37.678 --> 1:29:41.815
<i>is at grid reference, 243-546.</i>

1:29:41.949 --> 1:29:43.050
<i>I say again,</i>

1:29:43.182 --> 1:29:45.953
<i>is at grid reference,
243-546.</i>

1:29:46.085 --> 1:29:47.654
243,546.

1:29:47.788 --> 1:29:48.822
Roger that.

1:29:50.357 --> 1:29:52.459
Woody, bring them map.

1:30:13.847 --> 1:30:15.147
There we are.

1:30:16.115 --> 1:30:17.250
There we are.

1:30:19.118 --> 1:30:22.522
<i>It's been five days
since the Nigerian Air Force</i>

1:30:22.656 --> 1:30:25.826
<i>has continued to search
for the missing pilot.</i>

1:30:25.959 --> 1:30:30.664
<i>Amidst all other operations
still ongoing in the Northeast,</i>

1:30:30.797 --> 1:30:33.967
<i>the medical outreach
has continued.</i>

1:30:34.101 --> 1:30:37.938
<i>The Chief of the Air Staff
was in hand to see the progress</i>

1:30:38.071 --> 1:30:40.340
<i>and has this to say.</i>

1:30:40.474 --> 1:30:44.077
<i>Yes, so in the course
of our operations,</i>

1:30:44.211 --> 1:30:47.080
<i>a lot of people become displaced
from their homes.</i>

1:30:47.214 --> 1:30:49.883
<i>So as we fight
to protect them,</i>

1:30:50.017 --> 1:30:51.852
<i>we also try as much as possible</i>

1:30:51.985 --> 1:30:55.489
<i>to make their living conditions
as comfortable as possible</i>

1:30:55.622 --> 1:31:00.594
<i>by catering to their daily needs
and the medical care.</i>

1:31:00.727 --> 1:31:05.465
<i>We call this winning the hearts
and the minds of the locals,</i>

1:31:05.599 --> 1:31:07.668
<i>beyond bombs and bullets.</i>

1:31:07.801 --> 1:31:09.770
<i>When asked about
the fate of the pilot...</i>

1:31:11.004 --> 1:31:12.105
<i>I don't...</i>

1:31:12.239 --> 1:31:14.307
<i>My boys are on top of that.</i>

1:31:14.441 --> 1:31:16.343
<i>We'll find him
and bring him home.</i>

1:31:33.593 --> 1:31:35.595
All I hear
is they'll bring him back.

1:31:37.631 --> 1:31:38.665
When?

1:32:40.694 --> 1:32:41.962
No, I'll come with you.

1:32:42.095 --> 1:32:43.997
No, no, no.
You've already done enough.

1:32:44.131 --> 1:32:45.065
All right, sir.

1:32:45.198 --> 1:32:46.133
You're not a fighter.

1:32:46.266 --> 1:32:47.534
I'm a soldier.

1:32:55.408 --> 1:32:56.877
Give the man a weapon.

1:32:57.010 --> 1:32:58.111
Yes, sir.

1:32:58.246 --> 1:32:59.412
Let's go.
Go, go, go!

1:38:32.045 --> 1:38:33.713
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1:38:35.081 --> 1:38:37.585
He sees you.
He went back inside.

1:38:37.717 --> 1:38:38.785
The young man
I told you that seen me

1:38:38.918 --> 1:38:40.254
and the girls and the community

1:38:40.387 --> 1:38:41.489
is the one that released
these girls.

1:38:41.621 --> 1:38:42.755
I asked him to come with me,

1:38:42.889 --> 1:38:44.425
but he said
you're going to shoot him.

1:38:45.526 --> 1:38:46.427
No, no, sir.

1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:47.694
Baku went back inside,

1:38:47.827 --> 1:38:49.662
he said
he has unfinished business

1:38:49.796 --> 1:38:50.864
with his commander.

1:38:50.997 --> 1:38:53.234
There are a lot of people
in there, sir.

1:38:53.367 --> 1:38:54.301
Send your guys in.

1:44:12.920 --> 1:44:14.187
Hey!

1:44:15.589 --> 1:44:18.559
I'm not afraid to die
and you know it.

1:44:29.603 --> 1:44:33.707
I'm not afraid to die
and you know it.

1:44:33.841 --> 1:44:35.041
Let him go.

1:44:40.948 --> 1:44:43.149
We're both
the same right now.

1:44:43.283 --> 1:44:44.384
We're both murderers.

1:44:45.886 --> 1:44:47.387
Give me a free passage

1:44:48.455 --> 1:44:51.492
and I will let this boy
go alive.

1:44:51.625 --> 1:44:54.261
Let him go first
and I'll let you go.

1:44:56.797 --> 1:44:58.197
You must take me for a fool.

1:45:03.504 --> 1:45:07.139
Don't he know the meaning
of safe passage, huh?

1:45:07.274 --> 1:45:08.775
Look, I don't care.

1:45:08.909 --> 1:45:10.811
I could kill both of you.

1:45:10.944 --> 1:45:14.046
But it's a better option
if you let him go first

1:45:14.180 --> 1:45:15.215
and then I'll let you go.

1:45:15.349 --> 1:45:16.850
I need to get to this.

1:45:16.984 --> 1:45:18.117
I know that.

1:45:23.757 --> 1:45:25.559
I know you want him
desperately.

1:45:29.830 --> 1:45:31.197
Is that how you want to play it?

1:45:31.331 --> 1:45:32.799
Is that how you want it?

1:45:32.933 --> 1:45:33.934
Please, sir.

1:45:34.066 --> 1:45:35.536
Please don't kill him.

1:45:35.669 --> 1:45:36.637
Please.

1:45:36.770 --> 1:45:38.338
Please.

1:45:38.472 --> 1:45:40.374
I can see someone is in love.

1:45:41.508 --> 1:45:43.042
Amina.

1:45:43.175 --> 1:45:44.344
Amina, go back.

1:45:54.321 --> 1:45:56.122
You betrayed me.

1:46:30.424 --> 1:46:31.858
Search him, search him.

1:46:59.052 --> 1:47:00.954
Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1:47:01.088 --> 1:47:02.322
Let's go.

1:47:08.929 --> 1:47:10.564
Let's go, let's go, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

1:47:11.798 --> 1:47:13.132
Let's go.

1:49:09.416 --> 1:49:10.584
Paul Dike led the team.

1:49:10.717 --> 1:49:11.818
Mm-hmm.

1:49:15.422 --> 1:49:16.890
Well done.

1:49:17.023 --> 1:49:18.258
Thank you, sir.

1:49:21.862 --> 1:49:22.729
Welcome back.

1:49:22.863 --> 1:49:24.030
Yes, sir.

1:49:24.164 --> 1:49:25.098
Welcome back.

1:49:25.233 --> 1:49:26.466
Thank you, sir.

1:49:30.203 --> 1:49:32.372
Where's the young man
that spared your life?

1:49:32.506 --> 1:49:33.740
Bring Baku.

1:49:45.385 --> 1:49:46.553
Here, sir.

1:49:46.686 --> 1:49:50.590
Young man,
I want to assure you

1:49:50.724 --> 1:49:52.058
that government is doing

1:49:52.192 --> 1:49:55.529
all it can to restore peace
to our communities.

1:49:57.764 --> 1:49:58.932
Thank you very much.

1:50:00.734 --> 1:50:04.238
Thank you very much
for your change of heart.

1:50:04.371 --> 1:50:05.572
No, sir.

1:50:05.705 --> 1:50:07.541
I should thank you
for saving my mother

1:50:07.674 --> 1:50:09.776
and giving her a chance
to see again, sir.

1:50:13.747 --> 1:50:15.749
The medical team in Dalori,

1:50:15.882 --> 1:50:18.385
my sister and my mother
are there, sir.

1:50:23.590 --> 1:50:27.894
See, together,
we will defeat the enemy, hmm?

1:50:28.028 --> 1:50:28.995
Yes, sir.

1:52:32.485 --> 1:52:33.687
<i>In other news,</i>

1:52:33.820 --> 1:52:35.289

1:52:54.874 --> 1:52:56.476
If not for the time
they showed up,

1:52:56.609 --> 1:52:57.744
it was so timely,

1:52:57.877 --> 1:52:59.079
what was about
to unfold in that village

1:52:59.213 --> 1:53:00.281
would have been...

1:53:00.414 --> 1:53:01.081
it would have
been a different story today,

1:53:01.215 --> 1:53:02.216
I swear.

1:53:02.350 --> 1:53:03.984
- What'd I get?
- Is that why I'm here?

1:53:07.520 --> 1:53:08.588
My friend, I'm a married man.

1:53:08.722 --> 1:53:10.123
Go and marry.
I'm responsible.

1:53:11.425 --> 1:53:12.659
Go to the mess.

1:53:15.363 --> 1:53:16.330
Um, I'm okay.

1:53:16.464 --> 1:53:17.731
That is ready.

1:53:17.864 --> 1:53:19.499
I think you should come serve
yourselves.

1:53:19.632 --> 1:53:21.735
Aha, madam.

1:53:21.868 --> 1:53:24.372
I promised
I will bring your husband

1:53:24.504 --> 1:53:26.106
back home, and I did.

1:53:26.240 --> 1:53:29.109
Hear you say that nonsense,
nonsense.

1:53:31.878 --> 1:53:34.080
Hey, you both,
you both rescued me.

1:53:34.215 --> 1:53:38.785
Hey, look, I appreciate
you both equally.

1:53:38.918 --> 1:53:39.886
We what?

1:53:40.020 --> 1:53:43.457
We fall and we rise together,
right?

1:53:43.590 --> 1:53:44.624
- Right.
- Yeah, we rise.

1:53:44.758 --> 1:53:45.825
Even better,
we rise and rise.

1:53:45.959 --> 1:53:48.061
Yeah. Keep rising, yes.

1:53:48.194 --> 1:53:51.798
No, thank you both
for saving him.

1:53:51.931 --> 1:53:53.900
Oh,
you don't have to mention.

1:53:55.168 --> 1:53:57.304
And in all of this appreciation
and thanks,

1:53:57.438 --> 1:53:59.672
there's one person

1:53:59.806 --> 1:54:03.277
of whom without
I wouldn't be standing here

1:54:03.411 --> 1:54:05.246
with my beautiful wife,

1:54:05.379 --> 1:54:07.647
probably would have had a bullet
in my head long ago.

1:54:09.549 --> 1:54:11.017
Who is that?

1:54:11.151 --> 1:54:13.019
You're so quick to forget
the boy from the village, Baku.

1:54:13.153 --> 1:54:14.154
Oh!

1:54:14.288 --> 1:54:16.323
Oh, yeah.

1:54:16.457 --> 1:54:18.091
Baku, Baku, yeah.

1:54:18.225 --> 1:54:20.294
Well,
I still hope he shows up.

1:54:20.428 --> 1:54:21.594
Oh, you invited him?

1:54:22.996 --> 1:54:25.598
Oh, guess who is here.

1:54:27.700 --> 1:54:28.635
Speak about the devil.

1:54:28.768 --> 1:54:30.304
Look.

1:54:30.438 --> 1:54:31.238
Baku.

1:54:31.372 --> 1:54:32.605
Yes.

1:54:32.739 --> 1:54:34.707
Look at you, looking
all different and clean.

1:54:34.841 --> 1:54:36.709
You cut your hair.

1:54:36.843 --> 1:54:38.011
Good afternoon.

1:54:38.144 --> 1:54:39.179
Hi, sir.

1:54:41.549 --> 1:54:42.682
Wow.

1:54:42.816 --> 1:54:44.050
I tell you.

1:54:47.887 --> 1:54:49.889
Officers, meet my mother.

1:54:50.023 --> 1:54:53.626
Oh, it was you
with the sight problem.

1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:55.595
Oh, good to meet you, Ma.

1:54:55.728 --> 1:54:57.465
Welcome to our home.

1:54:57.597 --> 1:54:58.698
Wow.

1:54:58.832 --> 1:55:00.066
Very nice to meet you.

1:55:00.200 --> 1:55:01.435
Nice meeting you.

1:55:01.569 --> 1:55:05.004
And one more special person
who is no stranger to you.

1:55:05.138 --> 1:55:08.942
Well, to some of you,
you may have heard about her.

1:55:26.494 --> 1:55:27.495
Ooh!

1:55:27.627 --> 1:55:28.496
Wait.

1:55:28.628 --> 1:55:29.963
What?

1:55:30.096 --> 1:55:30.964
Amina?

1:55:31.097 --> 1:55:32.500
Yes, sir.

1:55:32.632 --> 1:55:33.666
Whoa, you remember her?

1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:35.402
Oh, my God.

1:55:35.536 --> 1:55:36.703
Whoa!

1:55:38.272 --> 1:55:39.573
You remember her?

1:55:39.706 --> 1:55:41.040
She looks different
in the city.

1:55:43.877 --> 1:55:45.346
Wow. Good.

1:55:45.479 --> 1:55:48.382
Amina, the lady that's given me
so much reason to live.

1:55:48.516 --> 1:55:49.649
I can see that.

1:55:51.285 --> 1:55:54.388
Now that peace has been restored
to our community,

1:55:54.522 --> 1:55:58.958
we are going back to rebuild
our homes and raise a family.

1:55:59.893 --> 1:56:01.495
Raise, what?

1:56:01.629 --> 1:56:02.962
- Both of you.
- Yes.

1:56:04.532 --> 1:56:05.633
You see your lives.

1:56:05.765 --> 1:56:06.866
Look at you.

1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:08.701
Look at you.
Look at this little boy.

1:56:08.835 --> 1:56:10.136
Look. Look.

1:56:11.272 --> 1:56:11.971
Congratulations.

1:56:12.105 --> 1:56:13.139
Congratulations, Baku.

1:56:13.274 --> 1:56:14.107
Good. Good.

1:56:14.241 --> 1:56:15.242
Wow.

1:56:15.376 --> 1:56:16.310
Wow!

1:56:16.443 --> 1:56:18.845
You guys are all welcome
to visit anytime.

1:56:18.978 --> 1:56:19.946
Of course, anytime.

1:56:20.079 --> 1:56:21.215
At least, this time

1:56:21.348 --> 1:56:22.316
we'll not be dropping
from the sky.
