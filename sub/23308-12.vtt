WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.747
Previously on "Us"...

00:02.750 --> 00:05.778
- What?
- Just imagine a montage.

00:05.781 --> 00:09.113
A group of fine looking grad students

00:09.115 --> 00:11.916
were invited to a secret school for magic

00:11.918 --> 00:13.348
where a bunch of stuff happened

00:13.351 --> 00:14.692
that doesn't really matter,

00:14.695 --> 00:17.889
until they ran into a mysterious figure.

00:17.891 --> 00:20.684
The answer to a riddle they
didn't even know to ask.

00:20.687 --> 00:21.926
It's you.

00:21.928 --> 00:23.461
Do you want this recap or not?

00:23.463 --> 00:27.265
So yeah, it was me. Things were awesome.

00:27.267 --> 00:29.934
For a minute. We became kings and queens.

00:29.936 --> 00:32.103
Well, everybody but you.

00:32.104 --> 00:35.890
Everyone hooked up, I had a
threesome with two harpies.

00:35.893 --> 00:38.408
Just get to the parts about me.

00:38.411 --> 00:41.546
You had a lot of drama with your hands.

00:41.548 --> 00:44.682
You signed a billion-year
contract with the Library

00:44.684 --> 00:47.952
- to help out Kady.
- Wait, who's that?

00:47.954 --> 00:51.046
Kady Orloff-Diaz? Love of your life?

00:51.049 --> 00:52.731
Looks like she could
crack open your balls,

00:52.734 --> 00:54.225
because she can?

00:54.227 --> 00:57.085
Well, it was a love for the ages.

00:57.088 --> 01:00.231
Despite the fact that Kady
got in way over her head

01:00.233 --> 01:02.367
with some hedge witches.
Especially her best bitch,

01:02.369 --> 01:04.468
Julia Wicker. Their term, not mine.

01:04.471 --> 01:07.405
I would never. Whatever went down

01:07.407 --> 01:10.408
definitely made them ex-best...

01:10.410 --> 01:12.276
Witches. Truthfully,

01:12.278 --> 01:14.245
the only person Kady can stand is you.

01:14.247 --> 01:16.481
And that pretty much cut both ways.

01:16.483 --> 01:18.616
No, come on, Penny,
don't... don't... Come on.

01:18.618 --> 01:21.285
And then you died. Kind of.

01:21.287 --> 01:25.656
Meanwhile, magic got all jacked up.

01:25.658 --> 01:28.226
You know what's weird,
that jacked up is bad,

01:28.228 --> 01:32.363
- but jacked off is great.
- Focus, dude.

01:32.365 --> 01:35.333
So, with magic gone,
a bunch of Fairy dicks

01:35.335 --> 01:38.636
invaded Fillory, made Eliot
and Margo look like derps,

01:38.638 --> 01:41.506
so the people revolted. Only ray of hope?

01:41.508 --> 01:43.965
Julia mysteriously still has magic.

01:43.968 --> 01:46.077
Why? Question mark!

01:46.079 --> 01:47.828
We got sent on a dope quest

01:47.831 --> 01:50.647
to find the Seven Keys that unlock magic.

01:50.650 --> 01:52.517
But the fourth one got dragon gobbled

01:52.519 --> 01:54.218
and lost in the Underworld.

01:54.220 --> 01:56.053
The other Penny sent us the key,

01:56.055 --> 01:58.089
but never came back.

01:58.091 --> 02:01.858
- Then came my grand adventure.
- Hard pass.

02:01.861 --> 02:04.762
I also saved the day
in your dumb timeline.

02:04.765 --> 02:07.498
- And snagged up Key seven.
- Yeah, I was there for that.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.906
And you didn't save shit.

02:08.908 --> 02:11.636
Now wait, you skipped the Sixth Key.

02:11.638 --> 02:13.371
This makes no goddamn sense.

02:13.373 --> 02:16.274
No, it's intentionally confusing.

02:16.276 --> 02:19.644
You see, Julia saved a bunch
of Fairies from slavery,

02:19.646 --> 02:22.447
So the Fairy Queen was
like, I have the Sixth Key,

02:22.449 --> 02:25.216
but I'm not going to give
it to you because she's...

02:25.218 --> 02:27.618
A creamy bitch is what she is.

02:27.620 --> 02:30.632
Meanwhile, Alice has
been acting real fishy.

02:30.635 --> 02:31.663
Quentin was all like...

02:31.666 --> 02:32.557
Are you working for the Library?

02:32.559 --> 02:34.057
- And she was all...
- Yes.

02:34.060 --> 02:36.127
And now, if you would please refer

02:36.129 --> 02:37.913
to the hookup/murder chart.

02:37.916 --> 02:40.765
Penny got with the other Alice.

02:40.767 --> 02:42.893
- Interesting.
- Now that we know

02:42.896 --> 02:48.138
who porked whom, let's
go over who murdered whom.

02:48.141 --> 02:49.830
Penny.

02:56.683 --> 03:00.084
You're Kady.

03:00.086 --> 03:03.788
- What's going on?
- I'm not your Penny.

03:21.541 --> 03:23.341
Julia?

03:23.343 --> 03:25.510
- Sorry, uh, what?
- What I'm saying is,

03:25.512 --> 03:27.278
if there's a monster behind the door,

03:27.280 --> 03:29.347
opening the door is probably
not the smartest plan.

03:29.349 --> 03:30.882
But that's where magic is, like...

03:30.884 --> 03:34.185
what, we can't exactly just
stop. Plus, this didn't come

03:34.187 --> 03:36.554
- from the most reliable source.
- He was you.

03:36.556 --> 03:39.490
- He was the Beast.
- Making decisions like this

03:39.492 --> 03:41.225
without understanding the consequences

03:41.227 --> 03:44.213
is exactly why magic is gone.

03:44.216 --> 03:46.082
So we figure out if it's true.

03:46.085 --> 03:50.654
We... we search the castle,
find out what's inside.

03:50.657 --> 03:52.424
We could ask the Library.

03:54.518 --> 03:57.304
Yeah, you're right. You should ask them.

03:57.307 --> 03:58.562
They say they want to help.

03:58.565 --> 04:00.878
It'd be nice if they actually did.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.893
I'll let you know what they say.

04:06.078 --> 04:07.635
Q...

04:09.862 --> 04:11.428
Do you have a better plan?

04:11.431 --> 04:13.356
Yeah, maybe don't trust the Library?

04:13.359 --> 04:15.793
They literally snort
the bones of Fairies.

04:15.795 --> 04:17.007
We don't have to trust them.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.529
The Penny that you brought with you,

04:18.531 --> 04:19.897
- The...
- Penny 23.

04:19.899 --> 04:22.900
Yeah, look. Ask him to follow Alice

04:22.902 --> 04:24.902
to the Library. He can Astral Project,

04:24.904 --> 04:26.916
they'll never even know he was there.

04:33.012 --> 04:35.346
Catching up on the news?

04:35.348 --> 04:37.014
My timeline was post apocalyptic,

04:37.016 --> 04:40.284
and it wasn't this fucked up.

04:40.286 --> 04:42.553
Alice is meeting with the Library.

04:42.555 --> 04:44.789
We need you to follow
her on the Astral Plane.

04:44.791 --> 04:47.127
Q thinks you're more
likely to say yes if I ask,

04:47.130 --> 04:50.885
because you and the
other me shared a thing.

04:50.888 --> 04:53.409
But we both know that
we're total strangers.

04:53.412 --> 04:56.164
- So...
- Go on.

04:56.167 --> 05:00.393
Well see, this is a
chance to un-fuck magic.

05:00.396 --> 05:02.840
And as a new citizen of Timeline 40,

05:02.842 --> 05:05.743
that should be something
you would want to do.

05:05.745 --> 05:08.830
Whoever asks.

05:08.833 --> 05:11.327
I have heard of the Castle
at the End of the World.

05:11.330 --> 05:13.260
It was built by the
gods, but its contents

05:13.263 --> 05:15.893
are secret by design.
All we mortals know

05:15.896 --> 05:17.821
is that we are not meant to know.

05:17.824 --> 05:20.758
Why wouldn't they want
you to know what's inside?

05:20.760 --> 05:23.628
Perhaps it is indeed the
lair of a horrifying monster.

05:23.630 --> 05:26.854
Or perhaps they simply
enjoy tormenting those of us

05:26.857 --> 05:30.225
who dedicate our lives to
cataloguing information.

05:30.228 --> 05:31.627
Well whatever their motive,

05:31.630 --> 05:33.564
we'd be idiots to go in totally blind.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.606
Then ask someone who's been inside.

05:35.615 --> 05:37.486
A god. I believe your friends

05:37.496 --> 05:42.165
have had encounters with them.
Now, there is another matter.

05:50.890 --> 05:52.659
That's the Siphon?

05:55.461 --> 05:57.135
We thought it'd be bigger.

05:57.138 --> 06:00.139
It needs to be powered, and
it requires a lot of energy.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.932
Our intended source has not fulfilled

06:01.935 --> 06:04.702
their end of our bargain.

06:04.704 --> 06:07.305
Well, how are we supposed to use it?

06:07.307 --> 06:09.999
Your friend Julia.
She's powerful enough.

06:10.002 --> 06:12.276
If her magic were
implanted into the Siphon...

06:12.278 --> 06:15.813
She'd never go for that
if she knew what this does.

06:15.815 --> 06:20.585
Then you'll have to take
the power from her by force.

06:20.587 --> 06:24.021
That could kill her.

06:24.023 --> 06:27.487
We've all made sacrifices in
pursuit of our greater purpose.

06:31.796 --> 06:33.562
We need the Siphon charged before...

06:33.565 --> 06:35.499
I know.

06:39.235 --> 06:43.737
I just need some time to
figure out another way, or...

06:43.740 --> 06:47.409
- I'll be in touch.
- Remember.

06:47.412 --> 06:49.604
Once magic is flowing again,

06:49.607 --> 06:53.151
you have 30 seconds
to attach the Siphon.

06:53.154 --> 06:57.256
If you miss that window,
our chance is gone forever.

07:08.739 --> 07:11.153
I come bearing gifts.

07:11.156 --> 07:13.757
This is like, 80% taco supplies.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.661
I'm sorry, do they not
have Tuesdays in Fillory?

07:16.663 --> 07:19.163
Feel free to do your own
grocery shopping next time.

07:19.165 --> 07:21.632
No, no, if I have to
catch, pluck, or boil

07:21.635 --> 07:24.879
one more pigeon, I'm going
to hurl myself off this ship.

07:31.444 --> 07:33.644
I was gone a lot longer
than I thought it would be.

07:33.646 --> 07:36.581
Listen, Fen.

07:36.583 --> 07:38.382
Before you were born, you were promised

07:38.384 --> 07:41.185
to a stranger. A king.

07:41.187 --> 07:44.188
And I'm not one anymore.

07:44.190 --> 07:47.391
You don't have to stay for my sake.

07:47.393 --> 07:49.660
I'm guessing you've never thought about

07:49.662 --> 07:52.363
where I would be if you never showed up.

07:52.365 --> 07:54.265
I have.

07:54.267 --> 07:57.301
Still in that same
village where I was born,

07:57.303 --> 07:59.161
married to one of the three

07:59.164 --> 08:01.272
obnoxious boys I lived next to.

08:01.274 --> 08:04.675
Now those boys want to
drop you off a waterfall,

08:04.677 --> 08:07.445
and that's them being polite.

08:07.447 --> 08:10.581
What do you think they would do
if they got their hands on me?

08:12.585 --> 08:14.619
That got less touching as you went.

08:14.621 --> 08:18.089
I can't go back to my old life.

08:18.091 --> 08:22.622
I'm stuck with you, and that
means you're stuck with me.

08:22.625 --> 08:24.879
We've been trying to
negotiate with the Fairy Queen

08:24.882 --> 08:27.298
for the last Key, but
this is what we got back.

08:27.301 --> 08:28.728
- Eat my ass!
- We're not sure if...

08:28.731 --> 08:29.926
Eat my ass!

08:29.929 --> 08:31.601
Eat. My. Ass!

08:31.604 --> 08:34.505
If this was the Fairy Queen's response

08:34.506 --> 08:36.707
or this is one very kinky rabbit.

08:36.708 --> 08:39.477
Maybe there's something we
can do to get her attention?

08:39.479 --> 08:41.379
Eat. My. Ass.

08:43.482 --> 08:47.294
These are on the house.
For you saving my life.

08:47.297 --> 08:48.819
We need to talk to your Queen.

08:48.821 --> 08:50.688
You must know how to get her to come.

08:50.690 --> 08:52.623
- It's an emergency.
- No.

08:52.625 --> 08:56.497
The last time I saw her,
she threatened to murder me.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.996
Glass half full... she didn't
actually go through with it.

08:58.998 --> 09:01.699
But you must have Fairy stepsisters

09:01.701 --> 09:03.868
or someone you can talk to?

09:03.870 --> 09:05.870
There were no Fairy
children in the realm.

09:05.872 --> 09:09.403
Just humans they bargained
away from their real parents.

09:09.406 --> 09:11.090
Like me.

09:11.093 --> 09:14.027
Being sent to you ruined everything.

09:14.030 --> 09:15.780
I can't go back to the Fairy Realm.

09:15.782 --> 09:17.648
I don't fit in with
humans. Why do you think

09:17.650 --> 09:20.318
- I work at an animal bar?
- No, really,

09:20.320 --> 09:22.987
really, I'm not judging you.

09:22.989 --> 09:24.989
Trust me, I'm not judging you.

09:24.991 --> 09:28.693
Now you show up and want
to make things even worse.

09:28.695 --> 09:31.778
Look, it's too late for me to
fix your fucked up childhood.

09:31.781 --> 09:33.481
But what we want to offer the Queen

09:33.484 --> 09:37.352
would mean real peace
for humans and fairies.

09:37.355 --> 09:41.591
Maybe the distance between
us can finally start to close.

09:41.594 --> 09:44.841
And maybe then, you won't feel so alone.

09:44.844 --> 09:46.544
That's kind.

09:46.546 --> 09:49.419
But just so you know, I'm not alone.

09:51.036 --> 09:52.902
No, really.

09:52.905 --> 09:55.161
Bye, Margo.

09:55.164 --> 09:56.630
Bye, Humbledrum.

10:00.188 --> 10:01.754
I love that bear.

10:01.757 --> 10:03.490
So do I.

10:03.493 --> 10:05.593
Yeah, hooray for bears, but we were

10:05.596 --> 10:09.270
- kind of having a moment.
- No, honey,

10:09.273 --> 10:11.406
she loves him.

10:16.117 --> 10:21.420
Uh, so not bear boss. Bear boyfriend?

10:23.650 --> 10:27.852
- Is that a thing in Fillory?
- Apparently, very taboo.

10:27.854 --> 10:30.958
But like I told Humbledrum,
as long as it's consensual,

10:30.961 --> 10:33.223
if I got my way, I'd say go hog wild

10:33.226 --> 10:35.051
or bear wild or bull wild.

10:35.054 --> 10:37.434
He's very concerned about
getting your approval.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.736
I don't think he quite gets

10:38.739 --> 10:40.939
that you're not even Fray's real dad.

10:43.970 --> 10:46.419
Well, then...

10:46.422 --> 10:51.826
I will say what I wish
my father had said to me.

10:51.829 --> 10:55.192
I'm so happy you're dating a bear.

10:59.819 --> 11:01.552
Thanks...

11:01.554 --> 11:02.887
Dad.

11:02.889 --> 11:05.556
Thanks, Fray's dad.

11:05.558 --> 11:07.762
No problem.

11:08.628 --> 11:10.606
That's all the Librarian knows.

11:10.609 --> 11:12.775
We have to find somebody
who's been inside the Castle.

11:12.778 --> 11:14.278
So...

11:14.281 --> 11:17.282
A god. You say that like it's easy.

11:17.285 --> 11:19.718
Our Lady Underground hasn't
answered me in months.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.888
Yeah, the only way to track Bacchus down

11:21.891 --> 11:23.972
was his Instagram, and it
looks like it got deleted

11:23.975 --> 11:26.387
for terms of service violations.

11:26.390 --> 11:29.324
Nipples, apparently.
Well, that's bullshit.

11:29.327 --> 11:32.428
I'll ask Dean Fogg.

11:32.431 --> 11:35.122
If I can catch him
when he's sober, maybe.

11:39.868 --> 11:41.735
She's lying.

11:41.738 --> 11:43.604
Not about the god stuff, that's true.

11:43.607 --> 11:45.274
It's what she's leaving out.

11:45.277 --> 11:47.744
They have some sort of metal thing

11:47.747 --> 11:50.781
called a Siphon. She's
supposed to charge it up

11:50.784 --> 11:54.403
by ripping out Julia's
power, which could kill her.

11:54.406 --> 11:56.231
She didn't seem psyched about the idea,

11:56.234 --> 11:58.151
but she didn't say no.

11:58.154 --> 12:01.522
So, now what?

12:14.707 --> 12:18.009
What's that? Truth Key?

12:18.012 --> 12:21.079
If it was, I'd tell you to go away.

12:21.082 --> 12:23.550
Unity.

12:23.553 --> 12:25.486
The walkie-talkie key.

12:25.489 --> 12:27.989
You're trying to talk
to the other Penny.

12:27.992 --> 12:32.361
No offense... you're the other Penny.

12:35.157 --> 12:38.629
Look.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.966
I don't blame you. You're
just trying to survive.

12:41.984 --> 12:46.454
It's... it's everyone else.

12:46.457 --> 12:49.791
Acting like finding you is enough.

12:49.794 --> 12:53.796
When our Penny, the real Penny,

12:53.799 --> 12:57.534
is out there. Down there.

12:57.537 --> 13:01.372
And maybe if...

13:01.375 --> 13:04.677
we talk to him, we could help him.

13:08.156 --> 13:10.890
- Oh, what?
- Just...

13:10.893 --> 13:14.208
all that shit that you
did for the other me.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.163
The only person that
would have done that for me

13:16.165 --> 13:20.372
on my timeline is Julia.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.776
Yeah, well...

13:23.779 --> 13:26.280
our Julia is different.

13:26.283 --> 13:30.985
She is not the person you loved.

13:30.988 --> 13:34.490
You don't owe me anything.

13:34.493 --> 13:35.826
But for what it's worth,

13:35.829 --> 13:39.597
it'd be helpful if you explained it.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.633
How she's different.

13:55.915 --> 13:58.782
What about Reynard?

13:58.784 --> 14:01.718
What happened to him
after O.L.U. took him away?

14:01.720 --> 14:03.887
I don't know.

14:03.889 --> 14:07.791
But it was his spark that
Our Lady gave to Julia.

14:07.793 --> 14:10.694
And now it's not about me.

14:10.696 --> 14:13.340
None of it ever really felt about me.

14:16.401 --> 14:18.817
So I've, uh...

14:18.820 --> 14:20.484
never really known how to deal

14:20.487 --> 14:23.722
with how angry I am at all of it.

14:23.725 --> 14:26.993
Wait, so he could be out there?

14:26.996 --> 14:30.631
Still a god, but powerless?

14:30.634 --> 14:32.333
I guess.

14:34.753 --> 14:37.487
And only gods know
what's behind the door.

14:42.695 --> 14:45.729
No.

14:45.731 --> 14:47.590
We have to find Reynard.

14:53.971 --> 14:55.734
Thank you for coming. I actually have

14:55.737 --> 14:57.158
nothing to say to you.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.594
I know what you want.

14:59.596 --> 15:02.697
- And I can't give it to you.
- We get it.

15:02.699 --> 15:05.523
Humans will chop you up
and snort your innards.

15:05.526 --> 15:07.765
But not all humans are
like that, you know that.

15:07.768 --> 15:11.070
- We aren't.
- I told Julia about our Key

15:11.073 --> 15:14.409
to give you all a chance
to give up on your quest.

15:14.411 --> 15:16.077
We aren't questing, we are surrendering.

15:16.079 --> 15:17.546
We are giving you what you want...

15:17.548 --> 15:19.713
A nice, quiet, moist as hell spot

15:19.716 --> 15:21.950
on Fillory for you to settle.

15:21.952 --> 15:23.852
And you give us the Key.

15:23.854 --> 15:26.555
Or... I walk away.

15:26.557 --> 15:28.957
And when the Lorians,
Floaters, and Western Hordes

15:28.959 --> 15:32.494
are done with Fillory, I can take it.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.029
All of it.

15:34.031 --> 15:37.165
Our lifespans dwarf even the dwarves.

15:37.167 --> 15:40.101
We can wait for what we want.

15:40.103 --> 15:43.805
Oh, but you can't, can you?

15:43.807 --> 15:46.775
You see, Fray, well, she told us

15:46.777 --> 15:49.544
that there are no Fairy
children in your realm.

15:49.546 --> 15:52.814
So... that's a prob.

15:52.816 --> 15:54.516
That's why you planted your eggs

15:54.518 --> 15:56.015
in the Northern Orchard, isn't it?

15:56.018 --> 15:58.070
You can't reproduce in the Fairy Realm.

15:58.073 --> 16:01.690
Without Fillory, you go extinct.

16:01.692 --> 16:04.159
Fine, ignore the problem.

16:04.161 --> 16:06.661
Your egg hole's only getting dustier.

16:06.663 --> 16:09.164
You no longer speak for
the people of Fillory.

16:09.166 --> 16:12.133
Tick Pickwick does.

16:12.135 --> 16:15.103
And he has no interest in a deal.

16:15.105 --> 16:19.507
If you want my Key,
come back with a crown.

16:19.509 --> 16:21.242
Or an army.

16:25.816 --> 16:30.085
I pray to you, Our Lady Underground.

16:30.087 --> 16:33.188
Please don't be withholding for once.

16:35.058 --> 16:37.726
- God damn it!
- Hello?

16:44.100 --> 16:47.001
Dean Fogg?

16:47.004 --> 16:48.635
Were you talking in here?

16:48.638 --> 16:52.674
No, I was not, why?

16:52.677 --> 16:55.956
I, um, I woke up this morning

16:55.959 --> 16:58.278
with this ringing in my ears.

16:58.281 --> 17:00.215
You should get that checked.

17:00.217 --> 17:04.085
By someone who isn't me.
But it's not just that.

17:04.087 --> 17:08.589
I can feel what other
people are feeling.

17:08.592 --> 17:12.694
You were given the power of a god.

17:12.696 --> 17:17.032
Spiritual people might say
that you're hearing prayers.

17:18.835 --> 17:21.236
I heard you.

17:21.238 --> 17:24.705
I felt something coming from you.

17:24.708 --> 17:26.651
What, exactly?

17:26.654 --> 17:27.907
Desperation.

17:27.911 --> 17:29.190
Oh.

17:29.193 --> 17:31.132
Look, I think that I'm
supposed to help you...

17:31.135 --> 17:34.049
No, I do not need your help.

17:34.051 --> 17:36.918
Yes, you do.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.187
- Your eyes...
- Were injured magically,

17:39.189 --> 17:41.089
and fixing them with
magic risks changing

17:41.091 --> 17:44.225
the very core of who I
am. Do you understand?

17:44.227 --> 17:46.094
Yes.

17:46.096 --> 17:49.729
If you did it, or another Magician.

17:49.732 --> 17:52.633
But that's not what I am, exactly.

17:52.643 --> 17:54.976
If I'm hearing prayers, I'm supposed

17:54.995 --> 17:59.531
to do something about them.
Why give me this otherwise?

18:44.755 --> 18:48.573
You know, I put a little
leftover pigeon in my taco,

18:48.576 --> 18:50.424
and it's really...

18:50.427 --> 18:52.026
really bad.

18:52.028 --> 18:55.230
We need the Key to get back magic.

18:55.232 --> 18:57.198
We need our thrones to get the Key.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.400
We need magic to get our thrones.

18:59.402 --> 19:02.070
It is an ouroboros of ass.

19:02.072 --> 19:03.905
Maybe King Idri and the Stone Queen

19:03.907 --> 19:06.479
will back our claims.
We defeat Tick's army,

19:06.482 --> 19:08.976
- storm the castle...
- Yes, and,

19:08.979 --> 19:11.589
what if we replace the part
where we kill everyone with...

19:11.592 --> 19:13.926
Oh, off the top of my head... democracy?

19:13.929 --> 19:16.563
Like we were going to do
before magic got borked?

19:16.566 --> 19:18.386
Tick's the only one who
can call for an election,

19:18.388 --> 19:21.756
and he's got nothing to gain.

19:21.758 --> 19:24.292
Oh, he'll call for it, all right.

19:24.294 --> 19:26.561
Josh, I need you to go to Kinko's.

19:28.465 --> 19:30.398
Election? What is this?

19:31.968 --> 19:34.903
There are thousands of them.
They were falling from the sky.

19:34.905 --> 19:38.773
Over villages, farms, a brothel...

19:38.775 --> 19:42.081
I... happened to... be walking by.

19:42.084 --> 19:43.883
Collect them all and burn them.

19:43.886 --> 19:45.953
Of course, your grumpiness.

19:45.956 --> 19:50.192
But as Abigail wisely reminded me,

19:50.195 --> 19:52.924
the citizens now believe
they're getting elections.

19:52.927 --> 19:55.690
You'd have to be the one
to announce they're not.

19:55.693 --> 19:57.926
Given the revolutionary mood

19:57.929 --> 19:59.854
the people have been in recently...

20:01.932 --> 20:03.432
Your plan worked.

20:03.435 --> 20:06.202
Tick already started putting
up his own campaign flyers.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.987
Of course it worked.
Giving people shit is easy.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.123
Taking it away is almost impossible.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.794
Like Obamacare.

20:13.797 --> 20:17.165
Or herpes. Too true, Bambi.

20:17.168 --> 20:19.001
Speaking of difficult conversations

20:19.004 --> 20:22.305
with a former lover,
do you have a second?

20:22.308 --> 20:24.651
Why the fuck shouldn't
my name be on that ballot?

20:24.654 --> 20:26.784
Because we are running for king.

20:26.787 --> 20:29.106
We can call the job whatever
we want after we win it.

20:29.109 --> 20:31.076
It has been a struggle
to bring this place

20:31.079 --> 20:33.651
into the 20th century. Yes, 20th,

20:33.654 --> 20:35.755
because when we got here,
it was straight up Dark Ages,

20:35.757 --> 20:37.023
and we have to start somewhere.

20:37.026 --> 20:38.826
Yeah, we're really civilizing them.

20:38.829 --> 20:41.134
What should we teach them
next? To outlaw abortion?

20:41.137 --> 20:43.401
Women don't want to work?
Wage gaps? Thigh gaps?

20:43.404 --> 20:46.105
Fillory is patriarchal.

20:46.108 --> 20:48.682
And we've got to put
our best foot forward.

20:48.685 --> 20:51.152
And I'm sorry, but in this case,

20:51.155 --> 20:52.987
our foot should have a dick.

20:56.899 --> 20:58.599
What, Josh?

20:58.601 --> 21:01.869
Do you have some patronizing
bullshit to tell me, too?

21:01.871 --> 21:04.872
No, uh, could you drop me
off at the Earth portal tree?

21:04.874 --> 21:08.576
- I have an idea, but I need...
- Me?

21:08.578 --> 21:12.480
- How did you...
- Yeah, I have no idea.

21:12.482 --> 21:15.816
Hi, Margo. I felt you needed my help.

21:15.818 --> 21:20.187
And now I'm here. It's been a weird day.

21:20.189 --> 21:24.151
Can't believe I did this.

21:24.154 --> 21:26.360
This forest fed so many people.

21:26.362 --> 21:28.062
Not for nothing,

21:28.064 --> 21:30.231
but when I was at my lowest point,

21:30.233 --> 21:32.500
that tiny spell you showed me,

21:32.502 --> 21:34.435
it's what got me back in the fight.

21:34.437 --> 21:39.073
Magic is the thing that makes
the children of Earth special.

21:39.076 --> 21:41.464
All I'm asking is, try.

22:38.534 --> 22:40.568
Vote Children of Earth.

22:41.970 --> 22:44.503
Vote Children of Earth.

22:48.086 --> 22:49.986
Vote the Children of Earth!

22:49.989 --> 22:53.042
Step right up, grab a poster.

23:03.136 --> 23:05.037
We need to talk.

23:05.039 --> 23:08.040
- Look, Quentin...
- What is a Siphon?

23:08.042 --> 23:10.309
And why do you need Julia to power it?

23:10.311 --> 23:12.945
- You spied on me?
- What does it do?

23:14.694 --> 23:17.394
It's a safeguard. That's all.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.964
The Library wants to turn magic back on.

23:19.967 --> 23:21.512
And once it's back on,
they want to make sure

23:21.514 --> 23:23.155
it doesn't get used for the wrong things

23:23.157 --> 23:26.858
- by the wrong people.
- So, the Siphon diverts

23:26.860 --> 23:30.479
magic to the Library so that
they can choose who can use it?

23:32.670 --> 23:35.037
Look, you took a test
to get into Brakebills.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.206
If you failed, you would
have gotten sent away,

23:37.209 --> 23:40.944
with no memory of
magic. Happily ignorant.

23:40.947 --> 23:43.008
But because a group of smart individuals

23:43.010 --> 23:47.839
made a judgment call, they let you in.

23:47.842 --> 23:49.909
Why should the Library get to choose?

23:49.912 --> 23:51.582
They're corrupt, they're killers.

23:51.585 --> 23:53.919
Yeah, so are we.

23:53.921 --> 23:56.121
At least they have the information,

23:56.123 --> 23:58.957
the perspective.

23:58.959 --> 24:00.559
You love magic, and you're probably

24:00.561 --> 24:03.128
the best there is at it.

24:03.130 --> 24:06.042
You're terrified of
what you'll do with it.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.780
- I have reason to be.
- I don't know everything

24:08.783 --> 24:11.854
that you did as a niffin, but
I know that people make mistakes

24:11.857 --> 24:14.291
so that they can change and do better.

24:14.294 --> 24:16.694
But only if they're given the chance.

24:16.697 --> 24:19.815
Taking away choice is not the answer.

24:22.605 --> 24:25.406
There are seven Keys, and
we have eight questers.

24:25.409 --> 24:27.740
We can do this without you, and we will.

24:27.742 --> 24:29.776
Unless you give me the Siphon.

24:47.762 --> 24:49.962
Just remember that when
magic was turned off,

24:49.964 --> 24:52.098
your dad went into remission, Q.

24:52.100 --> 24:55.067
And once you turn it back
on, his cancer comes back,

24:55.069 --> 24:57.703
and he dies.

25:03.178 --> 25:06.398
Straw polls are in, and
our ratings are way up.

25:06.401 --> 25:09.715
I mean, off the charts.
Julia has done us

25:09.717 --> 25:12.118
the solidest solid. After the trees,

25:12.120 --> 25:14.253
she grew food for the starving peasants.

25:14.255 --> 25:15.760
She fixed the dry wells.

25:15.763 --> 25:19.140
She even helped this one guy's
bajanked case of head lice.

25:19.151 --> 25:23.404
I mean, Children of
Earth are back on top!

25:26.801 --> 25:29.769
Her Flealessness suggests
that your time as High King

25:29.771 --> 25:32.726
has been so brief, the Fillorian people

25:32.729 --> 25:34.807
don't yet know what you stand for.

25:34.809 --> 25:38.911
I stand for them. I stand
for economic stability.

25:38.913 --> 25:42.148
For a solid, well-researched strategy.

25:43.318 --> 25:44.851
That's it.

25:44.853 --> 25:47.854
I'm going to tell them,
in detail, my plan.

25:47.856 --> 25:51.057
Rafe, write this down.

25:51.059 --> 25:54.757
My fellow Fillorians, I hereby set forth

25:54.760 --> 25:58.865
my policy to restore
economic and societal growth

25:58.867 --> 26:00.596
to a reunified Fillory...

26:00.599 --> 26:05.504
Blah, blah, blah, blah. So uninspiring.

26:05.506 --> 26:09.475
Does he really think he can
win by boring them to death?

26:09.477 --> 26:11.911
Josh!

26:11.913 --> 26:14.447
I hereby declare all native Fillorians

26:14.449 --> 26:17.149
shall receive ten free
sacks of grain every year.

26:17.151 --> 26:18.818
And how exactly are we supposed to

26:18.820 --> 26:21.354
grow that much grain, even with magic?

26:21.356 --> 26:24.123
You're making a promise you can't keep.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.959
Bambi, first rule of
politics on Earth...

26:26.961 --> 26:29.996
All you have to do is say it.
It doesn't have to be true.

26:32.233 --> 26:34.656
I hereby declare,
under my administration,

26:34.659 --> 26:37.436
low-interest loans for
all new infrastructure.

26:37.438 --> 26:39.492
Easy. No-interest loans.

26:39.495 --> 26:41.195
And we're going to
build Fillory's first...

26:41.198 --> 26:44.343
Power... plants.

26:44.345 --> 26:48.080
Like, geraniums?

26:48.082 --> 26:52.218
Will Tick's granular policies
keep you warm at night?

26:52.220 --> 26:54.020
No, you know what will?

26:54.022 --> 26:56.389
Extending the Fillorian summer.

26:56.391 --> 26:58.542
My proposition for
growth in new sectors...

26:58.545 --> 27:00.745
- Free healthcare for all!
- Based on rigorous

27:00.748 --> 27:02.848
- rigorous survey research...
- Champagne fountains

27:02.851 --> 27:04.984
- in every village.
- The abatement of dependency

27:04.987 --> 27:06.964
- on the Golden Goose standard.
- Wealth!

27:06.967 --> 27:08.633
Regulation of agricultural waste

27:08.636 --> 27:10.303
to prevent environmental runoff.

27:10.305 --> 27:12.338
- Feasts.
- Annual famine

27:12.340 --> 27:14.941
- and rampant poverty.
- Boat parties!

27:14.943 --> 27:16.846
Three cheers for Eliot!

27:16.849 --> 27:19.311
Hooray, hooray, hooray!

27:19.314 --> 27:23.049
- Eliot, I am so sorry.
- What is it?

27:23.051 --> 27:26.128
Tick's campaign just leaked
the transcript from your trial.

27:26.131 --> 27:27.986
You mean the one where he called Fillory

27:27.989 --> 27:29.889
a malodorous shithole?

27:29.892 --> 27:31.825
It's already hit the Posts.

27:35.163 --> 27:37.534
Son of a Pickwick.

27:41.302 --> 27:43.636
Julia, what the fuck...

27:43.638 --> 27:47.340
There's a little boy in Syracuse.

27:47.342 --> 27:50.643
I can feel his parents praying.

27:50.645 --> 27:56.115
I know if I just focus enough,
I can bring down his fever.

27:56.117 --> 28:00.953
I feel bad interrupting this.

28:00.955 --> 28:04.023
But we need your help with something.

28:04.026 --> 28:05.559
Finding Reynard.

28:07.195 --> 28:09.028
I know.

28:09.030 --> 28:11.497
But we need to talk to a god.

28:11.499 --> 28:14.300
- I want to help you, but...
- Julia.

28:14.302 --> 28:17.403
You have all the power now.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.605
Yeah, but he's still a trickster.

28:19.607 --> 28:22.174
We don't know what he's capable of.

28:22.176 --> 28:27.380
Look, nobody hates that he's
still alive more than me.

28:27.382 --> 28:30.349
But if we don't do it...

28:30.351 --> 28:33.419
we're at a complete standstill.

28:33.421 --> 28:36.822
All you'd have to do is locate him,

28:36.824 --> 28:40.826
power up Penny's tattoos,
and we'll take it from there.

28:40.828 --> 28:42.795
You can also say no.

28:47.568 --> 28:49.468
I'm not going to send you there alone.

28:49.470 --> 28:51.760
Great.

28:51.763 --> 28:53.672
All right, I'll get the
stuff for the locater.

28:53.674 --> 28:56.308
There's no need.

28:56.310 --> 28:59.812
I can feel him with my mind.

28:59.815 --> 29:02.482
- You guys ready?
- Wait, what are you...

29:08.321 --> 29:12.390
This is the place. He's nearby.

29:12.393 --> 29:15.394
I have to say, this is
pretty disappointing.

29:15.396 --> 29:17.196
Yeah.

29:17.198 --> 29:19.231
We were all kind of
hoping to find Reynard

29:19.233 --> 29:21.237
showering in a Russian prison.

29:34.326 --> 29:35.692
Oh, shit.

29:37.914 --> 29:43.185
Roxanne Gay, Bell hooks, feminist lit?

29:43.196 --> 29:46.897
What, are you saving these for
a rapist book burning party?

29:46.900 --> 29:48.904
I've changed.

29:48.906 --> 29:50.205
Living amongst the humans

29:50.207 --> 29:53.275
has given me a whole new perspective.

29:53.277 --> 29:55.477
You're still a liar and pathetic,

29:55.479 --> 29:57.946
but I guess you always were.

29:59.969 --> 30:02.302
Why are you here?

30:02.305 --> 30:05.253
What could I have that
you could possibly want?

30:05.255 --> 30:08.356
Let's talk about the Castle
at the End of the World.

30:08.358 --> 30:10.225
What's inside?

30:10.227 --> 30:11.993
How do you guys know about that place?

30:11.995 --> 30:13.914
Answer her question.

30:13.917 --> 30:15.984
You're not thinking of
going there, are you?

30:15.987 --> 30:18.265
You know there's a reason
the gods had the Architect

30:18.268 --> 30:22.504
- put it at the end of the world?
- The Architect?

30:22.506 --> 30:24.005
It's not for you little guys to know.

30:24.007 --> 30:25.640
It's funny...

30:25.642 --> 30:28.243
'cause from where I stand,
you're the little guy now.

30:31.114 --> 30:34.482
You have all my power, and look at you.

30:34.484 --> 30:37.519
Trying to handle something
you cannot handle.

30:37.521 --> 30:40.755
You should have kept your mouth
shut and stayed in your place.

30:40.757 --> 30:42.890
You've gotten yourself
into some real trouble now.

30:42.893 --> 30:44.759
You think it's easy being a god?

30:47.798 --> 30:50.498
You feel that?

30:50.500 --> 30:53.635
Your... tiny... spark

30:53.637 --> 31:00.508
has grown bigger in me than
it could have ever in you.

31:00.510 --> 31:03.011
You want the truth about the Castle?

31:03.013 --> 31:05.647
The Castle's where the gods put
the stuff they made before us.

31:05.649 --> 31:07.390
The stuff that didn't work out.

31:07.393 --> 31:09.953
Mistakes that never
should have happened.

31:09.956 --> 31:12.420
Kinda like you. I hope you do go.

31:12.422 --> 31:14.789
Open that door, see what happens!

31:17.863 --> 31:19.262
No!

31:30.340 --> 31:31.836
Recognize it?

31:34.378 --> 31:36.544
Yeah.

31:36.546 --> 31:40.782
I made it to kill him.
How did you get this?

31:40.784 --> 31:43.618
Did Our Lady give it to you?

31:43.620 --> 31:46.179
Of course not.

31:46.182 --> 31:48.382
My mother left me here to rot.

31:48.385 --> 31:50.792
My stepfather Hades was the
only one that took pity on me.

31:50.794 --> 31:53.762
He slipped me that gun to shoot
myself in case of emergency.

31:53.764 --> 31:55.226
I'm still a god.

31:55.229 --> 31:57.448
Limp or not, we're hard to kill.

32:02.256 --> 32:05.429
What are you willing to
bet this god killing bullet

32:05.432 --> 32:07.399
will work on the monster in the Castle?

32:09.680 --> 32:12.117
The fate of the world?

32:12.120 --> 32:14.187
That's good enough for me.

32:16.219 --> 32:18.253
Whoa, that's it?

32:18.255 --> 32:20.455
You're just going to leave him there?

32:20.457 --> 32:23.892
After what he did to the both of you?

32:23.894 --> 32:25.694
Shoot him.

32:28.088 --> 32:30.022
Kady, you wanted this.

32:30.024 --> 32:33.192
I wanted him to be
punished for what he did.

32:36.163 --> 32:40.032
And he is. Leave him here.

32:50.810 --> 32:55.279
I am here to deliver the
official election results.

32:55.282 --> 32:58.217
Eliot has lost.

32:58.219 --> 33:00.185
Shocker.

33:00.187 --> 33:04.056
Uh, Tick has also lost.

33:04.058 --> 33:05.457
Um, what?

33:05.459 --> 33:08.427
Our new High King...

33:08.429 --> 33:09.914
is Margo.

33:15.235 --> 33:17.768
But I wa... I wasn't even on the ballot.

33:17.771 --> 33:21.440
- You won as a write in.
- Who wrote me in?

33:21.442 --> 33:23.342
The talking animals.

33:23.344 --> 33:26.144
It seems you were the only
human on the campaign trail

33:26.146 --> 33:29.114
who stopped to listen to their concerns.

33:29.116 --> 33:31.216
You mean that drunk bear?

33:31.218 --> 33:33.619
Humbledrum is a highly respected

33:33.621 --> 33:37.689
member of the community.
You see, there are certain

33:37.691 --> 33:41.260
taboo subjects you broached with him.

33:41.262 --> 33:43.262
Bestiality?

33:43.264 --> 33:44.937
The talking animals believe

33:44.940 --> 33:47.265
that if they were allowed
to inter-marry with humans,

33:47.268 --> 33:50.269
then humans will finally
see them as equals.

33:50.271 --> 33:52.471
None of us were brave
enough to speak out

33:52.473 --> 33:56.241
in support of the cause, until you.

33:58.412 --> 34:01.446
You really love that sloth, don't you?

34:04.251 --> 34:08.286
So the human vote basically
means nothing in Fillory.

34:08.289 --> 34:10.389
Considering there's
never been an election

34:10.391 --> 34:12.156
or census before, we had no idea

34:12.159 --> 34:14.859
there were only 50,000
humans in Fillory,

34:14.862 --> 34:19.563
and upwards of a
million talking animals.

34:19.565 --> 34:21.600
So... yes.

34:23.803 --> 34:26.737
On behalf of Abigail,
let me be the first

34:26.739 --> 34:30.342
to swear loyalty to
the new administration.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.406
El...

34:37.650 --> 34:39.273
I'm so sorry.

34:48.860 --> 34:52.295
And allow me to be the second.

34:52.299 --> 34:55.934
High King Margo. Long may you reign.

35:35.909 --> 35:37.809
Hey, Tick.

35:37.811 --> 35:41.646
I intend to choose Death
by a Thousand Pokes.

35:41.648 --> 35:44.258
They say you only feel
the first hundred or so.

35:44.261 --> 35:46.018
Tick, we're not going to execute you.

35:46.020 --> 35:48.320
If you proved anything
during your campaign,

35:48.322 --> 35:51.957
it's that Fillory needs
a policy wonk like you.

35:51.959 --> 35:54.860
You're still bitch listed, but...

35:54.862 --> 35:57.396
King Margo would like
you in her cabinet.

35:58.932 --> 36:01.195
With a full 24-hour security detail

36:01.198 --> 36:03.286
watching everything you do.

36:03.289 --> 36:06.557
We don't trust you, but we need you.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.981
Citizenship for every Fairy,
full protection of the law,

36:15.983 --> 36:18.950
and a seat in the government.
But we need the Key.

36:18.952 --> 36:20.819
And you shall have it.

36:20.821 --> 36:23.789
Once the last Fairies have
been moved to our new home.

36:25.826 --> 36:28.693
I always saw something in you.

36:28.695 --> 36:31.496
Even when you didn't see it in yourself.

36:33.767 --> 36:35.734
Now, perhaps you will.

36:44.912 --> 36:48.466
You gave me...

36:48.469 --> 36:51.369
I can... I can see all sorts of things.

36:51.372 --> 36:54.974
It's a Fairy eye. A gift you will learn

36:54.977 --> 36:57.711
to understand in time.

36:57.714 --> 37:00.381
But one you must hide in plain sight.

37:04.356 --> 37:07.023
Could I maybe get some Fairy toes?

37:07.026 --> 37:09.593
Hello?

37:24.994 --> 37:26.816
- It's cranky as shit.
- Just take a little

37:26.819 --> 37:28.194
- off the top.
- I just collapsed

37:28.197 --> 37:29.587
my entire rental.

37:29.589 --> 37:31.755
- Last time, we were...
- Oh, my God...

37:31.757 --> 37:33.390
Are we supposed to sing again?

37:33.392 --> 37:35.326
- Holy shit, no.
- We've got news!

37:35.328 --> 37:36.927
- Penny, is that you?
- Yeah.

37:36.929 --> 37:38.796
We just got the last
Key from the Fairies.

37:38.798 --> 37:41.832
Okay, everyone just shut up! It's Penny.

37:41.834 --> 37:43.143
All right, look, listen.

37:43.146 --> 37:44.768
I-I don't know how much time we have.

37:44.770 --> 37:46.537
- Kady.
- But I'm going to get you out

37:46.539 --> 37:49.132
of the Underworld, no matter
what it takes, I promise.

37:49.135 --> 37:51.509
- Kady.
- I love you.

37:51.511 --> 37:53.878
This is Penny 23.

37:55.448 --> 37:58.816
The Key replaced my Penny with you.

37:58.833 --> 38:02.001
Look, I'm really sorry.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.360
This is it.

38:10.363 --> 38:12.863
The end of the story.

38:12.865 --> 38:15.900
Floodgates of magic, ready to be opened.

38:15.902 --> 38:18.602
Q? What's up, what's wrong?

38:23.408 --> 38:25.742
The quest is supposed to change us.

38:25.745 --> 38:28.045
I've sacrificed everything
that it wanted me to

38:28.047 --> 38:30.713
up to this point, and I-I... I can't...

38:30.716 --> 38:32.550
You thought that when you got here,

38:32.552 --> 38:37.488
you'd be 150% sure you
were doing the right thing.

38:37.490 --> 38:39.690
Now, you're only somewhere around 70%.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.626
Because you're worried about your dad.

38:44.529 --> 38:45.962
Party trick.

38:45.965 --> 38:49.466
I just feel things.

38:49.468 --> 38:52.736
I heard you healed Dean Fogg's eyes.

38:52.739 --> 38:56.541
- Maybe...
- I could heal your dad?

38:58.344 --> 39:00.477
Right now, he's perfectly healthy.

39:00.479 --> 39:03.814
There's nothing to do.

39:03.816 --> 39:06.016
If magic comes back,

39:06.018 --> 39:10.588
a lot of dominoes will fall
in ways that we can't predict.

39:10.590 --> 39:14.458
I don't know if I'll
be able to help or not.

39:14.460 --> 39:16.794
It's the deal.

39:16.796 --> 39:19.797
Sorry it's vague.

39:28.047 --> 39:32.083
What if the thing that the
quest wants me to be is cold?

39:34.714 --> 39:38.515
Being willing to sacrifice
the people I love?

39:43.522 --> 39:48.158
Then the quest fucked up when
it chose Quentin Coldwater.

39:48.161 --> 39:49.861
Maybe.

39:56.135 --> 39:58.268
It's all real.

40:00.271 --> 40:04.107
The Chatwins and Fillory.

40:04.110 --> 40:07.645
I've been there. I
s... I sat on a throne

40:07.647 --> 40:10.881
in Whitespire, and I...

40:10.883 --> 40:12.816
I explored the Flying Forest.

40:12.819 --> 40:16.621
And I... met Ember and Umber.

40:19.291 --> 40:22.860
I remember reading you those books.

40:22.862 --> 40:25.229
Curly Q...

40:25.231 --> 40:28.866
if all that's out there...

40:28.868 --> 40:33.137
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on a quest.

40:33.139 --> 40:37.307
In New Jersey?

40:37.309 --> 40:40.711
I have a problem.

40:40.713 --> 40:43.781
And I don't know what to do.

40:43.783 --> 40:47.918
No matter what choice I
make, somebody gets hurt.

40:47.920 --> 40:50.287
Magic's gone.

40:50.289 --> 40:52.923
Isn't it?

40:52.925 --> 40:55.926
I'm not like you. I'm not a Magician.

40:55.928 --> 40:58.896
But I could feel it when it was gone.

40:58.898 --> 41:00.631
And I knew it wasn't a coincidence

41:00.633 --> 41:03.901
when I went into remission a week later.

41:03.903 --> 41:07.506
You're right. My friends
and I were trying to fix it.

41:07.509 --> 41:11.642
- And how's that been going?
- We're getting really close.

41:17.415 --> 41:20.083
So are you here to ask my permission?

41:20.086 --> 41:22.548
To...

41:22.551 --> 41:24.484
turn it back on?

41:28.260 --> 41:31.395
On this quest...

41:31.398 --> 41:33.398
I've lived a whole life.

41:36.835 --> 41:41.404
I grew old, and I got
married. And I had a son.

41:41.407 --> 41:44.708
Who grew old.

41:44.710 --> 41:47.696
And what was all that
for if it's not for this?

41:50.703 --> 41:54.972
No, I'm not here to
ask for your permission.

41:59.714 --> 42:03.215
I wanted to look you in the eye

42:03.218 --> 42:07.020
and tell you that I'm sorry.

42:07.023 --> 42:09.595
I don't know what's going to happen.

42:11.736 --> 42:14.737
But I'm going to do this.

42:20.045 --> 42:23.046
What was his name?

42:23.048 --> 42:25.449
Your son.

42:25.451 --> 42:28.218
I named him after you.
