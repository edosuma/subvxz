The new God. Isn't that great?

00:26.151 --> 00:29.988
So your Dad's gonna retire,
and he chose you to replace him?

00:30.071 --> 00:33.158
Well, not in so many words. He asked
me and Amenadiel to keep it a secret,

00:33.241 --> 00:35.201
so it's obvious
he wants it to be one of us.

00:35.785 --> 00:38.997
-And Amenadiel doesn't want it?
-Nope. It's all mine.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.959
What about all the other angels?
Are they gonna be okay with this?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.045
No, they'll have
more opinions than Twitter,

00:45.128 --> 00:47.338
but Heaven's never been a democracy.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.799
It's best they don't find out
until Dad makes it official.

00:49.883 --> 00:50.717
But why you?

00:52.552 --> 00:55.889
Because I would be
a much better God than my father ever was.

00:55.972 --> 00:59.184
No, but why would you even want to be God?

00:59.768 --> 01:01.102
[huffs]

01:01.811 --> 01:05.106
Never mind the why.
This is gonna be great, Detective.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.442
Lots of changes when I'm in charge.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.445
War eradicated, world hunger satiated.

01:10.528 --> 01:14.616
Hangovers… never should have
existed in the first place. [laughs]

01:14.699 --> 01:16.701
[engine revs]

01:20.997 --> 01:23.708
You know, I really thought
you'd be more excited about this.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.044
Sorry.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.007
[sighs] I guess I'm just

01:31.591 --> 01:35.095
trying to wrap my mind
around what all of this means.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.097
-Means?
-For us. Yeah.

01:37.180 --> 01:41.101
Oh, well, it won't change a thing.
In fact, things will only get better.

01:41.184 --> 01:45.271
I'll become omniscient,
omnipotent, omnipresent. All the omnis.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.565
But how is that good for our relationship?

01:47.649 --> 01:50.860
I'll be there for you whenever
and wherever you need me.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.279
I'll know exactly what you're thinking.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.448
That's not at all dangerous.

01:55.532 --> 01:59.494
Well, I'll know exactly when you want me
to do that thing you like, for example.

01:59.577 --> 02:00.537
[chuckles]

02:01.121 --> 02:04.499
Look, Detective,
this is a good thing. Trust me.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.709
I do.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.627
I just…

02:07.710 --> 02:09.462
You need time to process.
Of course you do.

02:10.505 --> 02:13.591
Well, in the meantime,
how about business as usual?

02:13.675 --> 02:15.802

Could you imagine
being ripped apart by a shark?

02:34.237 --> 02:35.071
Do I have to?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.492
What do you think the worst part would be?

02:39.576 --> 02:43.371
Those big ole teeth
tearing into your skin,

02:43.454 --> 02:46.082
the water filling your lungs
as you scream

02:46.166 --> 02:50.295
or the heart attack
from the sheer terror of it all?

02:50.378 --> 02:52.130
You never cease to amaze me, Ella.

02:52.213 --> 02:55.258
I mean, even the darkest,
most morbid stuff gets you excited,

02:55.341 --> 02:58.428
and that's because you know
all this work's gonna help somebody.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.180
Yeah.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.892
[Lucifer] Sharks, one of Earth's
most misunderstood creatures.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.686
Definitely correcting that when I'm God.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.316
So, who do we have here?

03:11.399 --> 03:13.985
Bruna Lorenzoni, 33,
chief operator of the aquarium.

03:14.068 --> 03:17.864
-Pieces were found scattered in the tank.
-Obviously, death by shark, right?

03:17.947 --> 03:18.781
Wrong!

03:19.449 --> 03:25.413
See, this wound right here
is way deeper than any sort of tooth.

03:25.496 --> 03:28.416
Cleaner cut too,
made by some sort of blade.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.627
She was dead before she hit the water.

03:30.710 --> 03:34.088
So the killer dumped the body,
hoping the sharks would hide the murder?

03:34.172 --> 03:36.007
Should've known
we'd smell something fishy.

03:36.090 --> 03:39.844
-Aww, Dad joke, nice.
-Thanks. I'm practicing.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.639
We've located
all of her pieces except her left arm.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.016
And the fingernails
on the hand we do have

03:45.099 --> 03:48.353
show some sign of struggle,
so I sent the samples back to the lab.

03:48.436 --> 03:51.981
Her pieces were in the water
for a long time, so it's gonna be tough,

03:52.065 --> 03:55.109
but maybe our victim
nabbed some of the killer's DNA.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.320
-Who found the body?
-Elizabeth Newman.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.488
The aquarium's owner.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.407
I came in this morning because
Bruna wasn't returning my calls.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.369
I never imagined I'd find her like…

04:04.452 --> 04:05.662
like that.

04:06.537 --> 04:09.707
Oh, this is a nightmare. I don't know
how to do any of this without her.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.001
Do you know of anyone
who would want Bruna dead?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.920
No, I have no idea.

04:14.003 --> 04:17.757
She was a pillar
of our marine conservation community.

04:17.840 --> 04:21.427
Oceans wouldn't need saving if my father
hadn't been slacking. Just saying.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.807
Who had access
to the aquarium grounds after hours?

04:25.890 --> 04:29.143
[hesitates] I don't know.
Bruna ran everything.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.355
I love our animals as much as she does,

04:32.438 --> 04:34.857
but these days
I'm just more of the money person.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.068
Yeah. Uh, Detective, I just realized,

04:37.151 --> 04:40.196
when I'm God, I'll know
the answers to all your questions.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.365
No more asking
useless people like Lizzie here.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.702
Okay, well, you are not God yet,
so that is not helpful right now.

04:45.785 --> 04:49.372
Well, I'm just trying to get you as
excited about my new promotion as…

04:50.957 --> 04:51.791
I am.

04:52.917 --> 04:53.751
Excuse me.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.171
Brother, what are you doing here?

04:57.255 --> 04:58.798
You weren't answering your phone.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.049
Have you heard the news?

05:01.342 --> 05:02.802
Father's back.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.054
Really?

05:06.431 --> 05:09.225
But why do you look so worried?
He's still retiring, isn't he?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.894
Oh, yeah,
that's definitely still happening.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.855
Excellent. Well, I should go talk to him

05:13.938 --> 05:17.025
and get his blessing before
our meddlesome siblings find out.

05:17.692 --> 05:18.568
Yeah.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.112
About that…

05:22.447 --> 05:24.490
[chattering]

05:31.289 --> 05:32.332
[man] Thanks, Pop.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.587
Oh, bloody Hell!

05:47.013 --> 05:49.932
-[God] Hot dogs or burgers, my children?
-[Lucifer] Rude.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.517
I didn't get an invitation.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.102
Not even Gabriel's e-vite?

05:53.936 --> 05:56.147
Well, she emails too much.
I send her straight to spam.

05:56.230 --> 05:59.359
Hi, guys! Heard you talking about me.
Long time no see. Glad you could make it.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.402
-Archangels, assemble!
-[chuckles]

06:01.486 --> 06:03.446
Azrael says hi, wishes she could be here,

06:03.529 --> 06:05.531
but you know,
no rest for the Angel of Death.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.658
[both sigh] Hey, Gabriel.

06:07.742 --> 06:11.412
So, Amenadiel,
someone's been a busy angel.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.915
Spill. I wanna know everything
about your baby mama.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.292
Like I would tell anything
to the Angel of Gossip.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.504
-[chuckles]
-It's Angel of Messages, but whatever.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.464
I got plenty of hot goss without you.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.674
Have you heard?

06:23.758 --> 06:26.302
Dad's getting old, and he's losing it.

06:26.928 --> 06:27.762
Who told you that?

06:27.845 --> 06:28.846
Michael.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.973
At first we were like, "What? No way!"

06:31.057 --> 06:33.434
But then we heard that
Dad was making people sing,

06:33.518 --> 06:36.896
turned himself mortal,
lost his powers, exploded a human.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.564
He put the human back together again.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.025
Can we please talk about
the immediate problem here?

06:42.026 --> 06:44.570
Like all of us archangels
gathered here on Earth,

06:44.654 --> 06:47.407
out in the open
for all of humanity to see!

06:47.490 --> 06:50.368
Relax, brother, this is LA.
No one will even notice.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.495
Anyway, if you'll excuse us, sister,

06:52.578 --> 06:54.622
we would like to have
a chat with dear old Dad.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.000
[chuckles] Remiel.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.836
It's good to see you, brother.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.004
Sister.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.633
Ha! Nothing.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.471
Who invited the Devil
to our gathering of angels?

07:10.555 --> 07:12.473
Brother Zadkiel,

07:12.557 --> 07:16.185
still taking your Angel of Righteousness
role too seriously, I see.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.521
[inhales, spits]

07:20.773 --> 07:22.483
How dare you!

07:25.153 --> 07:27.780
That's not a godly way to behave, Lucy.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.241
You're right.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.201
Excuse me.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.501
Hello, my sons.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.503
Welcome to my retirement party.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.338
Can you smell what I'm cooking?

07:45.089 --> 07:46.591
I learned that phrase from Linda.

07:46.674 --> 07:49.594
Dad, I thought your retirement
was supposed to be a secret.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.137
It was, and thank you for keeping it.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.932
Father, we couldn't find you after
you disappeared from Lucifer's penthouse.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.393
Were you off planning your retirement?

07:57.477 --> 08:00.354
-Oh, I should do that, shouldn't I?
-[Gabriel] So, Dad.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.399
Since you're retiring, there'll be
a new you, right? Who's it gonna be?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.110
If it's a secret, whisper it in my ear.
I won't tell a soul.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.529
[Remiel] It's obvious
who will replace Father.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.865
-It's Amenadiel.
-[woman] Yes!

08:10.948 --> 08:14.911
[scoffs] Well, actually,
it's not going to be Amenadiel.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.413
It's going to be
the handsomest of us all.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.539
Hanjobadiel?

08:18.623 --> 08:19.874
No, not Hanjobadiel.

08:21.709 --> 08:22.919
It's going to be me.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.462
-[murmuring]
-What?

08:24.545 --> 08:27.507
-No.
-Amenadiel, tell him it's you.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.803
Remy, I'm sorry, but, uh…

08:34.222 --> 08:36.390
Lucifer has my full support.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.768
How can that be?
Of all the angels that are worthy--

08:38.851 --> 08:40.686
Who is more qualified than me?
Good point.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.524
I ran Hell for millennia.
Have any of you run your own kingdom?

08:45.107 --> 08:47.026
Even so much as a taco truck?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.822
[exhales] Didn't think so. [sniffs]

08:51.906 --> 08:54.825
Brother, you know
I've always followed your lead.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.036
Okay? But I cannot support the Fallen One.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.289
Father, this is your choice.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.625
Not theirs.

09:03.584 --> 09:07.213
Tell us who you choose
to be your successor. Please.

09:07.296 --> 09:11.509
Why don't you stay out of this with your
swirly staff and your bloody medieval--

09:11.592 --> 09:14.637
Children, children,
please, one thing at a time.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.807
My retirement plan, then my successor.

09:17.890 --> 09:18.849
[groans]

09:18.933 --> 09:22.645
But first, who wants
another hot dog? [laughs]

09:28.651 --> 09:29.652
[groans]

09:29.735 --> 09:33.614
Detective, I'm afraid that there has been
a speed bump in my road to becoming God.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.907
Oh, no, really?

09:34.991 --> 09:38.619
Yes, before Dad names me God 2.0,
he needs a retirement plan.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.622
So, I thought, what better way
to prove that I'm God material

09:41.706 --> 09:43.916
than to make his plans for him?

09:44.000 --> 09:47.753
Huh. Okay. Got it.
Well, in Earthly matters,

09:47.837 --> 09:50.339
we finished interviewing
everybody at the aquarium,

09:50.423 --> 09:53.259
and aside from
a few endangered fish gone missing,

09:53.342 --> 09:55.011
we've learned that-- Lucifer.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.430
-Hmm?
-We have a lead.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.056
On one of these retirement homes?

09:59.140 --> 10:00.641
-No, on the case.
-Oh.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.352
A few employees said
Bruna was arguing with her husband.

10:03.436 --> 10:07.607
They overheard him making threats to her
on some screaming match over the phone.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.941
You should bring him in.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.193
You think?

10:11.277 --> 10:14.280
Yes, I threatened my wife.
I threatened to leave her.

10:14.363 --> 10:18.659
That stupid aquarium was her entire life.
She paid zero attention to anything else.

10:18.743 --> 10:19.702
Including you?

10:19.785 --> 10:22.413
Me, our children, our dogs, housework.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.790
She couldn't even keep up
with her Fitbit challenges.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.792
The night she died, you know where I was?

10:27.376 --> 10:30.963
Home. Taking care
of our two sick kids, by myself.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.925
-So you're giving us your alibi?
-I watch cop shows. I know how this works.

10:35.009 --> 10:38.346
You'll find plenty of footage of me
covered in kid vomit on our nanny cam.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.806
Bruna's employees
heard you screaming over the phone.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.642
Was that also
about her never being around?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.561
That was mostly about the affair.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.982
She was making late night calls
to some restaurant owner named Jeremy.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.527
I followed her to his house,
but all they did was argue.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.988
Turns out it wasn't an affair.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.241
It was just about her fish.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.535
[chuckles] Even that was about work.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.913
Part of me hoped she was cheating on me,

11:03.996 --> 11:07.124
just to prove that her aquarium
wasn't her entire universe.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.501
Her universe?

11:10.628 --> 11:14.882
Would you say
she was sort of the god of the aquarium?

11:14.965 --> 11:15.883
Sure.

11:16.884 --> 11:20.262
A god who didn't have time
for the one who loved her the most.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.180
Me.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.435
Lucifer, are you hearing this?

11:26.519 --> 11:29.271
His godlike wife
didn't have time for him.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.649
-God, you say?
-Mm-hmm.

11:33.317 --> 11:36.028
[gasps] Which one
of these retirement homes

11:36.112 --> 11:39.615
do you think that your godlike wife
would enjoy the most?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.368
Uh, Golden Oldies has the best salad bar,

11:42.451 --> 11:44.787
but you can't beat
Big Sleep's water aerobics.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.205
Retirement? What are you--

11:47.081 --> 11:48.499
Bruna is dead.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.502
Right.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.130
Right, well, if you were God,

11:54.213 --> 11:56.966
which one do you think
you'd like to spend your eternity in?

11:58.092 --> 11:59.135
I wouldn't.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.054
[sniffles] Not without my wife by my side.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.848
Well, that doesn't help me at all.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.600
My dad's wife is in another dimension.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.269
I'm so sorry.

12:08.352 --> 12:12.440
But maybe Dad could do with a new partner.

12:12.523 --> 12:16.152
Well, that's it. Forget retirement homes.
You've given me a much better idea.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.905
Excuse me, what about the case?
You haven't even been listening.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.407
Yes, I was.

12:21.490 --> 12:25.745
Aquarium, Fitbit, kid vomit,
restaurant owner named Jeremy.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.329
-[grumbles]
-Wait.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.207
It's not Jeremy
of Jeremy's Fine Food, is it?

12:32.793 --> 12:37.381
Oh. Detective,
Jeremy is known in certain circles

12:37.465 --> 12:40.176
for serving rare, illegal animals.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.845
The aquarium's missing fish.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.765
If Bruna found out someone
was selling the fish to Jeremy

12:45.848 --> 12:49.059
and confronted him about it,
that's definitely motive for murder.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.102
[scoffs]

12:50.686 --> 12:51.854
Hmm?

12:51.937 --> 12:53.564
[groans]

12:55.941 --> 12:58.486
Having a soul is the worst.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.030
-But isn't that what you wanted?
-Yeah, until I got one.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.490
Got Eve and…

13:04.158 --> 13:06.702
turns out having
a soul mate that can die…

13:09.288 --> 13:10.247
It's torture.

13:10.956 --> 13:16.504
There's also something very special about
the limited time we have with someone.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.048
Maybe you could focus on what you do have

13:19.632 --> 13:21.467
instead of what you don't.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.635
[scoffs]

13:24.220 --> 13:26.347
Not when I know
Eve will end up in Heaven.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.225
Where I can never go.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.062
You don't know that
she's gonna end up in Heaven.

13:34.396 --> 13:38.943
She's the brightest, nicest,
most caring, honest person ever.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.653
Of course she's going to Heaven.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.572
Now that you have a new soul,
maybe you'll go too.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.534
With all the terrible things I've done,
Linda? Come on.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.870
Definitely going to Hell.

13:49.954 --> 13:54.458
But wasn't there a time that
all you wanted was to go back there?

13:54.542 --> 13:57.461
Yeah, as Hell's torturer.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.465
But with a soul, if I die,

14:01.549 --> 14:03.592
I'll turn up as one of the tortured.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.844
[exhales]

14:07.054 --> 14:07.888
Oh, God.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.353
I know how they're gonna torture me.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.148
I've gotta go fix this.

14:19.567 --> 14:24.405
♪ If you only knew
How much I loved you ♪

14:24.488 --> 14:29.159
♪ The sky would open up
And show from Heaven above… ♪

14:30.035 --> 14:30.870
Detective!

14:32.997 --> 14:34.790
Lucifer. You look handsome.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.375
You look good enough to eat.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.376
[laughs]

14:37.459 --> 14:41.797
Um, why are we at Jeremy's
right now, dressed like this?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.674
Weren't we gonna confront him tomorrow?

14:43.757 --> 14:47.720
Why put off till tomorrow what we
can do tonight whilst drinking wine?

14:47.803 --> 14:51.348
Besides, if we confront him head-on,
he'll surely deny, deny, deny.

14:51.432 --> 14:56.645
But if we get him to sell us one of
his deliciously illegal meats, then voila!

14:56.729 --> 14:58.272
[in French accent] Leverage.

14:58.355 --> 15:01.317
-[normal accent] Leverage.
-So like a sting-date combo.

15:02.359 --> 15:05.195
You know, that's a nice
work-life balance, Lucifer.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.324
Maybe I don't need to be so worried
about you becoming God after all.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.035
-Well, I told you. [chuckles]
-I know.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.456
It'll be nice to have some alone time,
just the two of us.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.624
[Lucifer] Mm.

15:16.707 --> 15:17.541
[God] Son.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.920
-Uh, and your dad.
-[Lucifer exhales]

15:21.003 --> 15:22.379
[woman] Chloe.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.757
And my mom.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.593
Oh, ready for our double Decker date?

15:29.637 --> 15:30.763
[chuckles]

15:38.520 --> 15:39.355
[Lucifer sighs]

15:39.438 --> 15:41.231
-[Chloe, God] Hmm.
-[woman] Oh!

15:41.315 --> 15:44.026
-Good to see you two finally together.
-[Lucifer chuckles]

15:44.109 --> 15:48.238
Hmm! On a surprise,
totally without warning, double date.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.408
Oh, you didn't know either?
Well, that explains a lot.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.702
My daughter never invites me to dinner.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.912
[chuckles]

15:54.995 --> 15:56.080
I was blindsided too.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.832
Impossible, Dad, you're omniscient.

15:58.916 --> 15:59.792
Dad?

16:01.126 --> 16:04.672
Well, we haven't been properly introduced.

16:04.755 --> 16:05.714
I'm Penelope.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.632
I know.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.593
Aww, you know my work.
Well, points already.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.095
And your name is?

16:11.178 --> 16:12.346
You can call me God.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.181
Frey! Godfrey is his name.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.266
Yeah, I thought you two would get along.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.978
Dad is retiring,
and Penelope herself is retired.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.730
-[hesitates] I am not retired.
-[Lucifer] No?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.273
Who told you that? My agent?

16:23.357 --> 16:27.736
Oh! Sorry, my mistake.
Well, you have other things in common.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.364
You've both lost spouses.
So, there's that.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.657
Your wife died?

16:31.740 --> 16:33.742
No, she's just in her own universe.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.496
Isn't that just
how relationships fall apart?

16:37.579 --> 16:39.915
My John and I, we were the opposite.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.667
We were totally connected.

16:42.543 --> 16:46.839
-Totally supportive of each other.
-Hmm.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.507
What? You don't agree?

16:49.425 --> 16:51.635
[inhales] Well, he was…

16:52.928 --> 16:54.847
completely supportive of you.

16:54.930 --> 16:59.685
He gave up his dream of becoming
a detective to support your career.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.478
And you're saying that's my fault?

17:02.062 --> 17:04.231
Children. They blame us for everything.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.068
Right? As if we created the world.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.112
[laughing]

17:13.198 --> 17:14.366
So…

17:15.743 --> 17:16.827
tell me, Godfrey.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.538
How long have you been this handsome?

17:19.621 --> 17:20.831
Hmm.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.295
[barking]

17:28.505 --> 17:30.007
[panting] All right.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.635
[shushing]

17:34.178 --> 17:37.890
One, two, three.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.059
[door opens]

17:40.142 --> 17:42.936
Maze! Maze, what are you doing?

17:43.020 --> 17:45.272
[sighs] Nothing.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.359
I can't do it.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.611
Can't do what?

17:50.694 --> 17:53.822
[sighs] Something I'll feel guilty about.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.699
[sighs] Why, Maze?

17:56.408 --> 17:57.534
[sighs]

17:58.202 --> 18:01.705
Because that'll be what Squee
tortures me with in Hell, okay?

18:03.123 --> 18:05.125
I know what my Hell loop is going to be.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.546
I was trying to change it.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.715
So you'd rather be a puppy murderer?

18:12.674 --> 18:16.178
I'm going to be trapped
in that hospital room, Amenadiel.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.639
Breaking Eve's heart.

18:18.722 --> 18:22.643
Losing her over and over and over.

18:25.020 --> 18:25.854
Forever.

18:27.731 --> 18:28.982
Maybe not, Maze.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.068
[shudders]

18:31.151 --> 18:34.488
When Lucifer becomes God,
you can just ask him for help.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.907
Hold on. Lucifer's doing what?

18:36.990 --> 18:39.034
He's taking over after our father retires.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.955
I'm sure it's gonna be no problem for him
to change the rules of Hell for you.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.250
You got this, right?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.459
-What?
-Yep, okay.

18:47.543 --> 18:51.046
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Maze, what are you doing?

18:51.130 --> 18:54.383
-Maze! Don't-- [groans]
-[urinating]

18:59.096 --> 19:01.557
My little rebel
made such a mess in that garden.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.643
[Penelope and God laugh]

19:04.726 --> 19:08.730
Chloe's most difficult phase
were her Goth years.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.275
[chuckling] Hot Topic
almost bankrupted us.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.901
-[God chuckles]
-Okay.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.530
Enough with the childhood
embarrassing stories, thank you.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.866
Godfrey, why don't you
tell us about your old job?

19:19.449 --> 19:22.411
What kind of work-life balance
did you have?

19:29.835 --> 19:32.045
I actually didn't have much of a life.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.173
It was pretty much all work.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.757
I'm sure he's exaggerating.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.012
Caused a lot of problems
between me and my wife.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.724
She always felt like
I didn't have enough time for her.

19:46.810 --> 19:47.936
Maybe she was right.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.692
-Oh.
-Ready to order entrees?

19:53.775 --> 19:55.194
-I'm not hungry.
-I'm vegan.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.280
-What? Since when?
-Okay, I'll order for the table.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.199
[waiter] Would you
like to hear our specials?

20:00.282 --> 20:01.867
Well, actually, um…

20:03.660 --> 20:05.829
[whispers] I'm interested
in your special specials.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.332
I'm in the mood for some Asian arowana.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.335
Sir, we don't serve
endangered animals here.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.045
That's not what I heard.

20:13.128 --> 20:15.047
I'd like to speak with the owner, please.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.007
Sorry, sir, you have the wrong idea.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.261
Well, I think we just blew our shot.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.889
Oh, merely a slight snag.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.850
Anyway, let's concentrate
on what's important here.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.186
Your mom and my dad.
A match made in Heaven.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.230
Excuse me.
Jeremy Morgan, I'm the owner.

20:31.313 --> 20:34.274
And I want to apologize
for our waiter's behavior.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.735
He had no idea
we had such an important guest.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.111
That's quite all right.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.405
Miss Decker, I'm a a huge fan.

20:40.489 --> 20:44.201
[chuckles] Althea: Queen of the Quarks,
that should have won you an Oscar.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.328
[laughs] Oh, my!

20:46.411 --> 20:50.040
Well, thank you. And I totally agree.

20:50.123 --> 20:52.167
[Jeremy] It is an honor
to have you in my restaurant.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.629
Now, we don't normally serve
first-timers from our secret menu,

20:55.712 --> 20:57.923
and sadly, we don't have any arowana,

20:58.006 --> 21:00.676
but I do have a delicacy fit for a queen.

21:00.759 --> 21:01.802
Oh.

21:01.885 --> 21:05.264
[Jeremy] Ailuropoda melanoleuca tartare.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.225
Ooh, sounds so European.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.727
-[God] You said you were vegan, right?
-Mm-hmm.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.063
You sure you wanna eat panda?

21:13.146 --> 21:14.231
Panda?

21:14.314 --> 21:16.191
Jeremy Morgan, you're under arrest.

21:16.775 --> 21:20.320
And I'm sure PETA will agree,
most likely going to Hell.

21:24.032 --> 21:26.159
Yesterday, on my morning run,

21:26.243 --> 21:29.788
I saw this guy about to cross the street,

21:30.706 --> 21:33.083
head in his phone, not paying attention,

21:33.834 --> 21:36.295
moments away from walking into traffic.

21:37.671 --> 21:43.260
And my mind
started picturing things. Like…

21:44.636 --> 21:47.472
like, really vivid things.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.394
Which car would hit him first?

21:53.395 --> 21:56.106
Which of his bones would shatter?

21:57.190 --> 21:59.985
The position his body
would land on the ground.

22:01.320 --> 22:05.365
Exactly how long
it would take him to bleed out.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.703
Detail after detail.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.958
I eventually snapped out of it, but…

22:15.917 --> 22:16.793
it was too late.

22:16.877 --> 22:17.794
He got hit?

22:17.878 --> 22:18.712
No.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.672
No, he-- He looked up in time.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.799
-But that, that's not the point.
-[sighs]

22:22.883 --> 22:27.971
The point is that helping him
wasn't my first thought.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.098
[voce breaking] Or my second.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.850
Or my third.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.020
[crying] How messed up is that?

22:35.771 --> 22:36.646
Ella.

22:38.982 --> 22:41.735
You've been coming to see me
ever since you caught Pete.

22:41.818 --> 22:46.865
And over all that time,
you've never taken a single day off.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.494
Maybe it's catching up to you.

22:50.577 --> 22:53.497
No, no, no, no,
the job is what centers me.

22:54.164 --> 22:57.292
Channels these thoughts
into some kind of purpose.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.007
The truth is…

23:05.926 --> 23:08.345
I've been this way my entire life.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.890
I've hidden it from everyone.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.142
[inhales]

23:14.810 --> 23:16.269
Dan, Chloe.

23:17.604 --> 23:20.357
Everyone thinks I'm a good person.

23:20.941 --> 23:24.236
I told Amenadiel that
I would try to accept myself, but…

23:25.278 --> 23:26.113
how?

23:28.240 --> 23:32.744
How can I accept myself when
this darkness is such a part of who I am?

23:43.422 --> 23:45.549
[sighs] Why haven't I heard anything yet?

23:45.632 --> 23:48.176
-[clears throat] Lucifer.
-I gave my Dad a phone.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.887
The least he can do
is text me how it went.

23:50.971 --> 23:54.266
As I was saying, we found
your freezer full of illegal meats.

23:54.349 --> 23:57.644
Bruna found out. She was gonna
expose you, so you killed her.

23:57.727 --> 24:00.730
I had nothing to do
with Bruna's death. I swear.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.400
-Yes, I serve exotic meats.
-[phone whooshes]

24:03.483 --> 24:05.861
Any idea how hard it is
to run a restaurant in LA?

24:05.944 --> 24:08.321
You have to innovate
just to stay in business.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.240
The savage isn't lying about that.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.325
-Oh, so you are with us?
-[phone chiming]

24:12.409 --> 24:13.577
Sorry.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.163
So, Bruna wasn't aware
of what you were up to?

24:16.246 --> 24:18.915
No, she was,
but she wasn't trying to stop me.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.792
She was trying to sell some of her fish.

24:20.876 --> 24:24.045
Marine conservationist Bruna,
whose whole life was that aquarium?

24:24.129 --> 24:25.714
I don't know about any of that.

24:25.797 --> 24:29.843
All I know is she approached me months ago
and offered to sell me some bluefin tuna.

24:29.926 --> 24:33.763
It's hard to come by, so I bought some.
I have the wire transfers to prove it.

24:33.847 --> 24:36.224
If you were in business,
what were you arguing about?

24:36.308 --> 24:38.935
A week ago,
she offered me her rarest fish.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.354
She said
she needed to sell $47,000 worth,

24:41.438 --> 24:43.732
but I'd just maxed out on my budget on…

24:45.108 --> 24:47.027
[sighs] …bald eagle.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.653
So I turned her down.

24:48.737 --> 24:53.033
She freaked out and left, and that's
the last time I had any contact with her.

24:53.116 --> 24:56.203
-Where were you the night of the murder?
-My restaurant. My employees can verify.

24:56.286 --> 24:57.704
-[chiming]
-[Lucifer] For Dad's sake.

24:57.787 --> 25:01.041
I know he has big fingers,
but these texts are simply indecipherable.

25:01.124 --> 25:05.086
I'm just gonna call him.
Excuse me, Detective. Wolfgang Yuck.

25:08.423 --> 25:10.425
We're gonna need those wire transfers.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.096
[cell phone ringing]

25:17.349 --> 25:21.311
[Lucifer] Oh, come on,
just answer the bloody phone.

25:23.146 --> 25:26.358
Oh, there you are. So?

25:27.108 --> 25:31.404
How'd it go? Ready to ride off
into the sunset with a Decker of your own?

25:32.447 --> 25:34.032
Penelope is lovely.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.245
But she's a few millennia
too young for me.

25:39.955 --> 25:43.291
Right. Okay. No double Decker. [chuckles]

25:44.334 --> 25:46.253
Well, there's plenty more fish in the sea.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.922
I'll find you a match
if it's the last non-God thing I do.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.967
Lucifer, you're not listening.

25:52.050 --> 25:57.097
There is and will always be
only one woman I will ever love.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.851
Fine. Well,
if you're gonna be stubborn about it,

26:01.935 --> 26:04.646
I'll plan a different element
of your retirement, then.

26:06.022 --> 26:06.856
Son.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.109
I don't need your help.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.444
I need to make sure
that everything's ready.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.071
Unless…

26:13.738 --> 26:16.449
Unless, of course, you just want
to name your successor now.

26:16.533 --> 26:20.120
Perhaps someone who's passionate about
making plans, if you know what I mean?

26:20.203 --> 26:22.289
You mean someone
who's trying to get rid of me.

26:22.872 --> 26:27.502
I am trying to make your transition
as smooth as possible, Dad.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.755
Get everything moving
so you can just give me the--

26:32.132 --> 26:34.634
give me the throne. [sighs]

26:36.886 --> 26:38.763
Everything in its time, son.

26:39.973 --> 26:40.807
For now…

26:42.601 --> 26:45.562
I don't wanna hear you speak
a word of my retirement again.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.399
Eh. Heard and understood.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.861
You won't hear another word about
your retirement come out of these lips.

27:06.833 --> 27:07.751
Hole in one.

27:09.836 --> 27:11.630
-Again.
-[chuckles]

27:13.381 --> 27:15.258
-This is fun.
-Huh.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.344
But I know why we're really here.

27:17.427 --> 27:20.180
Lucifer asked you
to talk to me about my retirement.

27:20.263 --> 27:21.139
He's delegating.

27:21.931 --> 27:24.851
One of the many requirements
of your job, right?

27:27.520 --> 27:30.231
And you're sure
you want Lucifer to take my place?

27:32.442 --> 27:34.319
Believe me, Dad, I…

27:35.695 --> 27:37.447
have my reservations, but…

27:39.991 --> 27:41.493
Lucifer's come a long way.

27:42.577 --> 27:45.080
And he does his best
when you put a little faith in him.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.208
Huh.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.378
So how many of these games
do you want me to win

27:51.461 --> 27:54.255
before we visit
Lucifer's retirement homes?

27:54.339 --> 27:56.341
[both laugh]

27:57.092 --> 27:58.593
I'm glad you're back, Dad.

27:59.302 --> 28:02.055
I'm really enjoying
spending this kind of time with you.

28:02.138 --> 28:02.972
Me too, son.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.935
[chuckles]
But something's been bothering me.

28:07.018 --> 28:10.605
-I mean, you're playing the perfect game.
-Should I take it easy on you?

28:10.689 --> 28:13.191
No, no, that's not it.
That's not it. It's just…

28:13.817 --> 28:14.651
I don't know.

28:16.152 --> 28:18.530
It doesn't seem
to me like you're losing it.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.157
It is strange, isn't it?

28:21.241 --> 28:22.158
I feel fine.

28:22.242 --> 28:24.244
When's the first time
you noticed a problem?

28:26.621 --> 28:28.957
I didn't. Michael did.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.709
A few months back.

28:31.793 --> 28:32.627
Michael noticed?

28:33.753 --> 28:37.465
And did you feel like you were
losing control of your powers then?

28:38.883 --> 28:42.804
[exhales] Not right away,
but the more we talked about it,

28:42.887 --> 28:44.431
the more I realized I was.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.687
You know we angels self-actualize, right?

28:51.396 --> 28:53.565
Dad, what if you self-actualize too?

28:53.648 --> 28:55.900
What if you're doing this to yourself?

28:58.403 --> 28:59.529
Oh!

28:59.612 --> 29:03.783
Amenadiel says Dad didn't want
to see any of the rest homes I picked.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.160
-Huh.
-[sighs]

29:05.243 --> 29:09.164
Do you think maybe
he's reconsidering retiring, maybe?

29:10.457 --> 29:12.751
You don't want me to be God, do you?

29:12.834 --> 29:15.545
Lucifer, this whole case,
you know, your mind has…

29:16.629 --> 29:17.464
been elsewhere.

29:17.547 --> 29:21.676
And I just wonder if
when you're actually ruling the universe,

29:21.760 --> 29:23.219
you don't have time for us.

29:23.887 --> 29:27.223
Just like your dad said that
he didn't have time for your mom.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.977
Detective, I have told you,
I'm going to do things differently.

29:31.561 --> 29:35.732
[chuckles] Said every child
of every parent ever.

29:36.357 --> 29:39.152
Guys, so I checked
Bruna's secret wire account,

29:39.235 --> 29:40.779
and it confirms Jeremy's story.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.655
She was totally
receiving deposits from him.

29:42.739 --> 29:44.741
-So she was selling her fish.
-[Ella] That's not all.

29:44.824 --> 29:49.370
A few days before she was murdered,
she received a mondo transfer for $47,000.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.998
The exact same amount
that Bruna told Jeremy she needed.

29:52.081 --> 29:54.167
Mm-hmm.
Now, I don't know who sent the payment,

29:54.250 --> 29:58.880
but I was able to track the routing info
to an IP registered to this address.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.804
[grunting]

30:12.060 --> 30:15.730
Huh! That sushi they're eating
could be Bruna's fish.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.023
Recognize anyone?

30:17.732 --> 30:20.610
Oh! Yakuza tattoos.

30:20.693 --> 30:22.737
[grunting]

30:26.908 --> 30:31.037
-Wonderful. Who do you think's in charge?
-My guess. The impressive chap in red.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.372
I'll get us an audience.

30:32.455 --> 30:33.873
But we have a warrant.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.500
Well, respect will get us further.

30:35.583 --> 30:39.295
And the quickest way to earn that
is to display superior skills in battle.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.922
Battle? Lucifer, no.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.299
Relax, Detective,
I'm invulnerable, remember?

30:43.383 --> 30:45.802
Besides, my dad has been
driving me up the wall.

30:45.885 --> 30:47.512
I need to blow off some steam.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.098
Lucifer--

30:50.181 --> 30:52.809
[men murmuring]

30:54.561 --> 30:55.812
Fancy another go?

30:55.895 --> 30:57.981
-[laughing]
-Oh?

30:59.190 --> 31:00.817
Very well, I'll go first.

31:00.900 --> 31:01.985
[snarls]

31:06.531 --> 31:08.741
Hai! [man grunting]

31:10.159 --> 31:11.244
[grunts]

31:14.038 --> 31:16.416
-[grunts]
-[men laughing]

31:17.500 --> 31:21.212
-[speaks Japanese]
-[man chuckles] Oh!

31:27.886 --> 31:29.220
[gasps]

31:31.723 --> 31:33.016
[growls]

31:33.099 --> 31:36.227
Well, this doesn't seem
like a very fair fight.

31:36.311 --> 31:38.187
Let's even things up, shall we?

31:42.191 --> 31:44.485
[grunting]

31:55.079 --> 31:56.331
[chuckling]

32:00.627 --> 32:01.461
[thuds]

32:04.714 --> 32:05.924
Yummy.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.676
-Who knows what that is?
-Good point.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.095
[chuckles] Okay,
that's not Bruna's endangered fish.

32:11.179 --> 32:13.056
I only bought her good legal stuff.

32:13.139 --> 32:15.099
$47,000 worth?

32:15.183 --> 32:18.895
No. That was purely a donation I made
'cause she was an honorable woman.

32:18.978 --> 32:23.024
What's so honorable about making
a profit selling endangered animals?

32:23.107 --> 32:25.193
She wasn't keeping the money for herself.

32:25.276 --> 32:28.738
She was putting the money back
into the aquarium to save the fish.

32:29.322 --> 32:32.867
The place was in dire straits. Without
the 47K, the aquarium would go under.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.870
So she was sacrificing
a few fish to save the many?

32:35.954 --> 32:36.788
[man] Hmm.

32:36.871 --> 32:38.831
Did anyone else know what Bruna was doing?

32:38.915 --> 32:41.542
A woman called from the aquarium
asking about the donation,

32:41.626 --> 32:43.461
implying it was for some missing fish.

32:43.544 --> 32:45.546
She sounded angry.
I didn't catch her name.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.464
Huh.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.676
-Oh, thank you.
-Yes, thank you.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.761
-[man exhales]
-See? Easy.

32:52.345 --> 32:55.181
Yes, but which female employee
would have motive to kill Bruna?

32:55.264 --> 32:56.766
Well, who would be more angry

32:56.849 --> 33:00.770
about the aquarium being used as
a seafood bar than our old friend Lizzie?

33:00.853 --> 33:02.271
The woman who actually owns it?

33:03.356 --> 33:04.774
Exactly.

33:04.857 --> 33:08.236
-But we have no evidence to prove it.
-[sighs]

33:14.283 --> 33:17.662
So, what was it
you wanted to see me about?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.295
Well, don't you wanna keep it?

33:26.379 --> 33:28.923
Eve doesn't want it,
so it's useless to me.

33:30.341 --> 33:35.972
[sighs] Maze, I am sorry
that I didn't tell you about your mother.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.683
I wanted to.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.311
I don't know,
maybe I shouldn't have kept my promise.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.564
It's okay. Lucifer, I get it.

33:45.606 --> 33:48.609
You were just trying to protect me
from having to face how…

33:49.110 --> 33:51.571
little I meant to her.

33:54.866 --> 33:55.700
Yeah.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.662
So I hear you're going to be God.

33:59.746 --> 34:02.623
If all goes well.
Do you wanna talk me out of it?

34:02.707 --> 34:03.750
No.

34:04.584 --> 34:05.793
I want you to be God,

34:06.377 --> 34:08.713
so you can change
one of the rules of Hell for me.

34:08.796 --> 34:12.175
Ah, yes, Amenadiel told me
you want me to change your Hell loop.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.092
No.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.805
I want you to change
who can sit on the throne.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.184
But Father said
Hell no longer needed a warden.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.855
But maybe it deserves one.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.024
You?

34:30.735 --> 34:32.403
Is that what you really want?

34:35.364 --> 34:36.949
I can't stay here, Lucifer.

34:38.367 --> 34:41.788
And I want to control
who does the torturing.

34:44.707 --> 34:45.541
[exhales]

34:48.836 --> 34:50.046
Well.

34:50.630 --> 34:54.217
I can't think of anyone
I would trust more with our old home.

34:58.387 --> 34:59.680
To Mazikeen.

35:00.723 --> 35:01.599
Queen of Hell.

35:03.684 --> 35:07.188
I was thinking Maziqueen. But whatever.

35:07.939 --> 35:08.773
[chuckles]

35:08.856 --> 35:10.108
[glasses clink]

35:12.318 --> 35:14.570
-[typing]
-[sighs]

35:19.826 --> 35:22.829
-Daddy Morningstar! Hey.
-[chuckles]

35:23.955 --> 35:26.249
Oh, if you're looking for your son, he--

35:28.251 --> 35:29.627
You know what I just realized?

35:30.711 --> 35:32.547
If you're Lucifer's dad,

35:33.214 --> 35:36.134
that would make you God. Right?

35:36.217 --> 35:37.885
Hmm. That would, wouldn't it?

35:39.220 --> 35:40.680
I really wish you were.

35:40.763 --> 35:43.933
'Cause I am grasping
at straws in our latest case.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.562
And it would be so much easier
if you'd just, you know… [clucks]

35:47.645 --> 35:51.065
wink, wink, just tell me
how to catch our killer.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.733
I can't tell you that.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.068
[Ella groans]

35:54.152 --> 35:57.321
But I can tell
you're struggling with something.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.827
Is there anything I can do to help?

36:05.496 --> 36:08.624
Not unless you can
smite the darkness out of me.

36:09.792 --> 36:11.460
Everyone has darkness in them.

36:12.086 --> 36:15.256
It's not about getting rid of it.
It's about accepting it.

36:19.552 --> 36:20.970
Yeah, but mine's…

36:21.888 --> 36:23.222
mine's different.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.057
Deeper.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.394
It attracts me to bad people.

36:30.396 --> 36:31.272
I think…

36:32.607 --> 36:36.068
I think maybe I'm a bad person.

36:37.361 --> 36:38.321
My child.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.282
The darker the darkness,

36:42.116 --> 36:43.534
the brighter the light.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.704
And you, Miss Lopez,

36:47.371 --> 36:50.791
shine so very, very brightly.

36:51.751 --> 36:54.086
I can see it all the way from Heaven.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.255
[exhales]

36:57.548 --> 37:01.302
-[computer beeps]
-Oh, uh, those are the results!

37:04.138 --> 37:05.181
Oh, my gosh.

37:06.557 --> 37:09.018
My hunch paid off. My--

37:19.987 --> 37:20.947
Uh… [clears throat]

37:21.030 --> 37:24.408
So, God is retiring.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.786
And Lucifer's taking his place.

37:27.495 --> 37:28.329
Hmm.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.831
Makes an odd amount of sense.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.875
Really? That's your reaction?

37:32.959 --> 37:36.921
Well, Lucifer is surprisingly great
at big picture kind of stuff.

37:37.004 --> 37:39.632
I mean, he did just pull off
a pretty elaborate prank

37:39.715 --> 37:42.969
that made me think… [chuckles]
I got a bunch of people killed. So…

37:43.052 --> 37:44.762
I'm sorry. Lucifer did what?

37:44.845 --> 37:45.972
D-Doesn't matter.

37:46.055 --> 37:50.101
The-- the point is, it was
a pretty transformative experience for me.

37:50.184 --> 37:51.560
In a good way.

37:51.644 --> 37:55.106
So, if Lucifer is God,
I can think of crazier things.

37:55.189 --> 37:56.023
Wow.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.485
Did not think
I would ever hear that from you.

38:00.152 --> 38:04.532
But, um… [clears throat]
that's not what I'm concerned about.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.577
What are you worried about then?

38:08.661 --> 38:13.207
That he won't be able to balance
being the ruler of the universe

38:13.291 --> 38:15.459
with being my boyfriend.

38:16.085 --> 38:18.045
Which, when I say out loud,
sounds selfish--

38:18.129 --> 38:19.213
No. Mnh-mnh.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.423
-Yeah.
-I get it.

38:20.506 --> 38:21.465
It's a lot.

38:23.217 --> 38:26.095
But if it's any comfort,
Lucifer's crazy about you.

38:26.178 --> 38:27.263
And you know that.

38:27.346 --> 38:28.723
And you're crazy about him.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.892
So I think you should just trust that
whatever challenges life throws at you,

38:31.976 --> 38:33.060
you're gonna figure it out.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.356
Prepare to be impressed.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.609
So you guys remember how we couldn't
find the victim's missing arm, right?

38:40.693 --> 38:43.070
So based on her husband
saying that she had a Fitbit,

38:43.154 --> 38:48.534
I was able to track its serial number,
ping its location and boom, found it!

38:50.328 --> 38:51.329
[Dan] Huh.

38:51.412 --> 38:54.332
It's still at the aquarium, you guys.

38:54.415 --> 38:56.584
Doing figure eights in one of the tanks.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.086
So it's inside of a shark?

38:59.170 --> 39:00.087
Bingo!

39:00.171 --> 39:02.006
Now sharks swallow their meals whole,

39:02.089 --> 39:05.634
so if there's any sort of evidence
on that arm, it might still be there.

39:05.718 --> 39:08.846
Yeah, but the hand that we already have
didn't produce any identifiable DNA,

39:08.929 --> 39:12.016
so with water and stomach acid,

39:12.099 --> 39:14.143
the chances are
even slimmer with this arm.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.064
Right. But the killer doesn't know that.

39:20.858 --> 39:23.527
[man] Uh, I don't know about this.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.947
It's just a fish.
If I could move it on my own, I would.

39:27.031 --> 39:30.534
You're asking us to move a shark.
I'm sorry, lady, but we gotta go.

39:31.744 --> 39:33.954
-Come on.
-[Chloe] You, uh, moving something?

39:35.081 --> 39:36.665
[chuckles] Detective!

39:37.833 --> 39:40.920
This, uh…
this shark's grown too large for his tank.

39:41.003 --> 39:43.297
I'm transporting him
to the marina to set him free.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.759
Just two hours after I told you
it's digesting a piece of evidence.

39:46.842 --> 39:50.429
Hmm. I couldn't imagine a more
suspicious time to suddenly free Willy.

39:51.472 --> 39:52.890
The shark's name is Andrew.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.393
And I'm sorry,
but unless you have a warrant,

39:55.476 --> 39:58.813
then whatever's in Andrew's stomach
has to stay there while I release him.

39:58.896 --> 40:02.108
That's funny because I thought
you were a hands-off kind of boss.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.610
Not when it comes
to covering up her crimes, it seems.

40:04.693 --> 40:06.028
Oh, and we do have a warrant.

40:06.112 --> 40:08.072
Our search team is
in your office right now.

40:08.155 --> 40:10.825
Plus, I'm sure we'll find
your DNA on Bruna's arm.

40:10.908 --> 40:14.703
So I would say
you are dead in the water, Lizzie.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.581
[hesitates]

40:17.665 --> 40:19.750
I was-- I was too hands-off.

40:21.085 --> 40:25.881
I-- I found out too late
that Bruna was playing God,

40:25.965 --> 40:29.718
choosing which fish would live
and which ones would die.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.638
None of these beautiful creatures
deserve that.

40:32.721 --> 40:35.558
Sounds to me like
Bruna wasn't the only one playing God.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.476
Did you enjoy smiting her?

40:38.561 --> 40:40.062
I didn't mean to kill her.

40:40.146 --> 40:42.982
I-- I confronted her about--
about what she was doing,

40:43.065 --> 40:44.775
and she-- she threw it in my face.

40:44.859 --> 40:49.280
She said that she'd been telling me
about our financial issues for years.

40:49.905 --> 40:52.658
You know, things got heated, and I…

40:55.661 --> 40:56.495
I lost control.

40:56.579 --> 41:00.291
I didn't even know I had the letter opener
in my hand until I stabbed her with it.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.003
If I had just listened to her…

41:05.337 --> 41:07.465
given her what she needed
when she told me,

41:07.548 --> 41:10.843
then none of this
would have ever happened.

41:11.802 --> 41:15.764
Well, Elizabeth Newman, you're under
arrest for the murder of Bruna Lorenzoni.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.100
[mutters]

41:18.184 --> 41:20.186
[handcuffs click]

41:23.397 --> 41:24.815
Lucifer, you okay?

41:26.567 --> 41:27.568
No, I--

41:28.360 --> 41:30.905
Something our killer said
just made me realize something.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.992
I don't think I've been listening at all

41:35.075 --> 41:38.537
to what my father
truly wants for his retirement.

41:41.081 --> 41:42.374
Would you excuse me?

41:43.375 --> 41:45.002
There's something I need to do.

42:00.309 --> 42:01.727
[sighs]

42:04.313 --> 42:06.941
Hey, Gabriel. You got a minute?

42:13.489 --> 42:16.742
Oh, come on, I know you're listening.
You always are.

42:17.409 --> 42:19.411
[wings flap]

42:25.417 --> 42:26.418
What can I say?

42:26.502 --> 42:28.337
It's one of my God-given talents.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.547
Indeed.

42:29.630 --> 42:34.051
But right now I am interested
in one of your other talents.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.054
I, uh…

42:38.180 --> 42:39.890
I need you to do me a favor.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.648
[knock on door]

42:51.110 --> 42:51.944
[Chloe] Mom!

42:52.027 --> 42:54.405
Hi. What are you doing here?

42:55.239 --> 42:57.324
I brought Trixie a chocolate cake.

42:58.367 --> 42:59.243
Oh.

43:01.453 --> 43:02.871
How thoughtful.

43:02.955 --> 43:06.667
She won't be here until later,
but thank you.

43:15.134 --> 43:16.302
Mom, are you okay?

43:17.136 --> 43:18.721
It's what you said at dinner.

43:19.471 --> 43:23.183
I mean, do you really think
I'd make your father give up his dreams?

43:26.228 --> 43:29.648
Well, I don't know
if you made him, but he did.

43:32.776 --> 43:33.819
Oh, darling.

43:34.945 --> 43:37.906
You always think you know everything.

43:37.990 --> 43:40.242
Your father and I had a deal.

43:40.326 --> 43:41.785
We would take turns.

43:41.869 --> 43:46.915
He'd hold off on becoming a detective
until I got my acting career going.

43:47.583 --> 43:50.544
And then after a few years,
we would switch.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.172
[hesitates] But when it came time…

43:55.174 --> 43:57.384
for his turn, he, um…

44:00.888 --> 44:01.722
He died.

44:04.600 --> 44:09.355
[voice cracks] I wanted to see
your father become a detective so badly.

44:14.193 --> 44:15.110
I'm sorry, Mom.

44:19.073 --> 44:23.702
I just need you to know that I loved
your father from the bottom of my heart.

44:24.286 --> 44:29.667
And I'd give anything to have another
chance at being the supporting partner.

44:31.377 --> 44:33.629
Okay, Mom. [sniffles]

44:34.171 --> 44:35.005
I hear you.

44:42.471 --> 44:44.723
[sniffles] You wanna stay for dinner?

44:46.308 --> 44:49.978
-We have dessert.
-[laughs, sniffles]

44:59.154 --> 44:59.988
Lucifer!

45:00.989 --> 45:03.450
-[chuckles]
-Why'd you call us here, brother?

45:03.534 --> 45:07.287
Well, after finally listening to what
Dad's been telling me all along,

45:07.371 --> 45:11.667
I realized there's only one thing that's
gonna make his retirement fulfilling.

45:11.750 --> 45:14.837
So, I enlisted Gabriel's help
to make it happen.

45:15.921 --> 45:18.632
Did you know our sister can
deliver a message anywhere?

45:19.133 --> 45:20.259
And I mean…

45:21.427 --> 45:22.261
anywhere.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.236
Mom?

45:40.070 --> 45:41.697
Hello, my sweet boy.

45:46.326 --> 45:47.411
Husband.

45:48.245 --> 45:49.079
Wife.

45:52.499 --> 45:53.584
Lucifer, how?

45:53.667 --> 45:57.755
Well, it wasn't easy. Mom says she only
has enough juice for this one time.

45:57.838 --> 45:59.840
I never thought I'd see you again.

46:00.466 --> 46:02.551
I never thought I'd see you retire.

46:03.135 --> 46:05.929
Hmm. Well, like I've always said,

46:06.638 --> 46:07.639
it's a tough gig.

46:08.640 --> 46:11.268
But you understand that
now that you're doing it.

46:13.395 --> 46:16.398
I don't find it nearly as difficult
as you made it out to be.

46:16.482 --> 46:17.941
[chuckles]

46:21.278 --> 46:24.156
Then clearly
you're better at it than I ever was.

46:25.532 --> 46:27.034
No surprise in that.

46:30.537 --> 46:31.830
Well, I must admit, though…

46:36.001 --> 46:37.753
it does get lonely at the top.

46:40.005 --> 46:42.216
Lucifer,
you don't have to become God anymore.

46:42.299 --> 46:45.844
I found out Dad's not losing his powers.
Michael's been gaslighting him.

46:46.428 --> 46:48.013
It's all been inside of his head.

46:48.096 --> 46:52.851
Michael? [scoffs] Well, he won't get away
with that sorta thing when I'm in charge.

46:52.935 --> 46:56.522
Brother, do you hear what I'm saying?
Dad's fine. He can keep being God.

46:56.605 --> 46:58.273
Everything can go back to normal.

46:59.233 --> 47:00.234
Everything.

47:02.402 --> 47:04.279
We can be a family again.

47:04.363 --> 47:06.865
[chuckles] Wonderful,

47:06.949 --> 47:11.119
except for the part where I don't get
to become God and prove that I'm worthy.

47:11.203 --> 47:13.789
[hesitates] Just, I'll deal with this.

47:14.665 --> 47:18.252
So looks like my plans
for Dad's retirement

47:18.335 --> 47:20.629
have got off
to a smashing start. [chuckles]

47:20.712 --> 47:22.673
What's it gonna be, hmm?

47:22.756 --> 47:25.300
Good old Florida?
Back up to the Silver City?

47:26.969 --> 47:28.595
Actually, we have decided…

47:31.223 --> 47:33.141
we're moving to my universe.

47:35.519 --> 47:36.353
What?

47:36.937 --> 47:39.523
But you're both here.

47:40.190 --> 47:41.984
-Together.
-[Lucifer] Yeah.

47:43.485 --> 47:45.153
You're just gonna leave us again?

47:47.114 --> 47:49.408
Without any ability to come back?

47:50.951 --> 47:55.038
Your mother spent a long time in my world.

48:00.544 --> 48:01.420
It's my turn…

48:04.256 --> 48:05.591
to spend time in hers.

48:08.218 --> 48:11.680
[sighs] Dad, a-- a word, please.

48:26.653 --> 48:28.530
I can't believe I'm saying this, but…

48:29.573 --> 48:31.700
now that we know you're not losing it,

48:31.783 --> 48:35.746
there's no need for you to retire.
You can just keep on being God.

48:37.080 --> 48:38.999
I thought you wanted to be God.

48:39.082 --> 48:42.252
Well, I did. I-- I do. [hesitates]

48:42.336 --> 48:45.464
But you've only just got here.

48:46.673 --> 48:47.549
Can't you…

48:48.550 --> 48:50.719
stay and annoy me for a bit longer?

48:55.015 --> 48:56.642
Nothing lasts forever, son.

48:59.686 --> 49:00.938
[huffs]

49:02.773 --> 49:03.774
I am so…

49:06.610 --> 49:09.571
so sorry I didn't get
to say goodbye last time.

49:10.614 --> 49:13.825
-No, I never blamed you, Mom.
-No. [chuckles]

49:13.909 --> 49:15.327
Of course you didn't.

49:15.410 --> 49:19.414
My kindest, wisest, most perfect son.

49:20.165 --> 49:22.000
And now the perfect dad.

49:22.084 --> 49:23.460
I'm far from it.

49:24.086 --> 49:24.920
But…

49:26.213 --> 49:27.506
I'm trying my best.

49:32.427 --> 49:34.429
That's what makes you perfect.

49:36.848 --> 49:39.977
So that's it?
I've got no choice in the matter?

49:40.060 --> 49:42.437
I've given you a life of choice.

49:44.314 --> 49:45.482
This one's mine.

49:47.192 --> 49:48.026
[sighs]

49:51.780 --> 49:52.698
Lucifer.

49:53.615 --> 49:55.200
At our family dinner…

49:56.660 --> 49:57.661
you were right.

50:00.706 --> 50:03.709
[inhales] I could
have been a better father to you.

50:06.003 --> 50:09.548
[chuckles] Well,
now you forego your mysterious ways.

50:10.173 --> 50:11.591
Just as you're leaving?

50:11.675 --> 50:14.469
No need for them anymore
now that I'm retiring.

50:16.096 --> 50:17.097
Which means…

50:18.223 --> 50:19.057
[Lucifer sighs]

50:19.141 --> 50:22.978
…I can say something
I've wanted to for a long time.

50:26.982 --> 50:28.525
I love you, son.

50:31.028 --> 50:33.321
[sighs deeply]

50:33.905 --> 50:36.950
And I am very proud
of the man you've become.

50:42.456 --> 50:43.915
[Lucifer sobbing]

50:52.299 --> 50:55.010
I think Amenadiel
might like to hear that too.

50:55.093 --> 50:56.720
-[God laughs]
-[panting]

50:59.139 --> 51:00.307
I already told him.

51:03.810 --> 51:05.771
It was an emotional round of golf.

51:06.813 --> 51:07.939
[chuckles]

51:12.444 --> 51:15.447
Time to go. My universe needs me.

51:19.743 --> 51:21.661
-[Lucifer] Oh.
-[sighs]

51:22.829 --> 51:24.414
Thank you, son.

51:35.258 --> 51:36.426
[God sighs]

51:37.969 --> 51:39.262
Dad, wait.

51:41.431 --> 51:43.391
You forgot to name your successor.

51:44.476 --> 51:46.061
It's not up to me anymore.

51:47.479 --> 51:48.688
You'll figure it out.

51:49.606 --> 51:52.692
Back to your mysterious ways already.

51:52.776 --> 51:54.820
All part of my plan.

51:57.948 --> 51:59.074
Plan.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.998
How much of this was your plan?

52:08.250 --> 52:09.417
[chuckles]

52:13.672 --> 52:14.881
Goodbye, my loves.

52:21.471 --> 52:22.764
[Lucifer sighs]

52:43.910 --> 52:44.995
[sighs]

52:49.875 --> 52:51.960
-Hi.
-[exhales]

52:52.544 --> 52:53.962
I'm glad you called.

52:54.796 --> 52:56.173
How are you holding up?

52:56.673 --> 52:59.259
Oh, nothing lasts forever, I suppose.

53:00.802 --> 53:01.803
[huffs]

53:05.891 --> 53:07.184
I decided something.

53:08.101 --> 53:09.769
I'm quitting the LAPD.

53:13.523 --> 53:14.357
Sorry.

53:15.066 --> 53:18.570
Sorry, I thought I heard you say
you were quitting the LAPD.

53:19.779 --> 53:20.614
Yeah.

53:22.949 --> 53:28.538
I became a cop so that
I could do good and help people.

53:29.831 --> 53:34.878
And as God, you'll have
the power to help, well, everyone.

53:34.961 --> 53:37.839
So if I can help you become God…

53:40.592 --> 53:42.802
then I'll be helping everyone as well.

53:45.680 --> 53:47.474
[hesitates] Are you sure?

53:49.100 --> 53:53.939
I mean, how can I call you "the Detective"
if you're not actually a detective?

53:54.522 --> 53:55.649
[chuckles]

53:56.983 --> 53:57.943
Lucifer…

53:58.985 --> 54:03.156
you've been helping me
do my job for the last five years.

54:04.282 --> 54:06.201
Now it's my turn to support you.

54:08.036 --> 54:09.663
That's what partners do, right?

54:10.497 --> 54:11.414
[gasps]

54:12.582 --> 54:13.541
[chuckles]

54:14.709 --> 54:16.419
I'll take that as a yes.

54:18.296 --> 54:19.464
[Lucifer sighs]

54:23.093 --> 54:25.345
-[wings flap]
-[Remiel] Lucifer!

54:28.014 --> 54:29.015
Where is Father?

54:29.099 --> 54:31.559
Uh, excuse us, we were having a moment.

54:31.643 --> 54:32.769
Where is he?

54:32.852 --> 54:35.939
Gone. Retired. Eternally unavailable.

54:36.022 --> 54:37.399
Did he name his successor?

54:37.482 --> 54:41.319
No, he said it was up to us
to figure it out, but why?

54:41.903 --> 54:42.737
Can we talk?

54:43.947 --> 54:45.198
Without the human?

54:45.282 --> 54:49.160
No. Whatever you want to say to me,
you can say in front of…

54:50.537 --> 54:52.914
my consultant. [chuckles]

54:54.374 --> 54:55.292
So be it.

54:56.251 --> 54:59.546
Upon returning to the Silver City,
I discovered something alarming.

54:59.629 --> 55:02.507
Michael's been gathering support
from the others.

55:02.590 --> 55:03.758
Support for what?

55:04.384 --> 55:06.344
Michael wants to be God.

55:06.970 --> 55:10.432
The sneaky bastard.
I bet this was his plan all along.

55:10.515 --> 55:14.019
If it's up to our brothers and sisters,
it looks like he has a good shot,

55:14.102 --> 55:15.020
which is why…

55:15.895 --> 55:18.148
and I cannot believe I am saying this…

55:23.361 --> 55:25.613
I am backing you, Lucifer.

55:25.697 --> 55:28.325
I may not like you,
but I hate Michael even more.

55:28.408 --> 55:31.619
Now there's a ringing endorsement
for my campaign poster.

55:33.163 --> 55:35.248
Michael would never suspect
I'd take your side.

55:36.583 --> 55:39.044
So, I'll find out what he's up to.

55:39.127 --> 55:41.588
[sighs] Whatever it is, it can't be good.

55:41.671 --> 55:44.716
And knowing my brother,
he won't be wasting any time.

55:53.016 --> 55:54.934
[animals shriek]

55:55.018 --> 55:55.852
Hello.

56:05.612 --> 56:07.280
-Who's your favorite brother?
-Oh!

56:07.364 --> 56:08.740
Quit it, dork!

56:08.823 --> 56:10.784
Gotcha. [chuckles]

56:11.368 --> 56:13.870
I did the favor for Lucifer,
like you asked me to.

56:13.953 --> 56:16.790
Gotta say, Mom's universe is pretty cool.

56:17.415 --> 56:19.459
The centaurs freak me out, though.

56:20.543 --> 56:21.461
And…

56:23.963 --> 56:25.548
You get the thing?

56:26.925 --> 56:28.009
I got the thing.

56:29.761 --> 56:31.137
-You wanna see it?
-Uh-huh.

56:33.473 --> 56:34.933
-Careful!
-[clattering]

56:36.559 --> 56:38.436
This thing can actually kill us.

56:38.520 --> 56:40.271
Oh, that's right.

56:40.897 --> 56:41.773
My bad.

56:42.982 --> 56:44.317
[sighs]

56:45.360 --> 56:46.611
[exhales]

56:47.153 --> 56:50.949
Azrael really should have
kept a better eye on her blade.
