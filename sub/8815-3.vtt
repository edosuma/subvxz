WEBVTT

00:02.226 --> 00:04.796
LUCIFER: Previously on Lucifer...

00:04.797 --> 00:07.250
So you're the Devil, and
you've left Hell behind

00:07.318 --> 00:09.986
to take a vacation in Los Angeles.

00:10.054 --> 00:11.120
How could you possibly help me?

00:11.189 --> 00:12.121
I have a certain skill set.

00:12.190 --> 00:13.590
I can be very persuasive with people.

00:13.658 --> 00:16.024
I got it, the name, the
whole "Lucifer" thing,

00:16.093 --> 00:17.927
and desire is like your superpower.

00:17.995 --> 00:20.029
- (Lucifer groans)
- CHLOE: How did you survive

00:20.097 --> 00:21.497
getting shot six times?

00:21.565 --> 00:22.685
Is that your normal reaction

00:22.732 --> 00:23.666
to someone saving your life?

00:23.733 --> 00:25.100
When I see something I can't explain,

00:25.168 --> 00:26.268
yeah, I look for answers.

00:26.336 --> 00:28.016
Well, I've given you
the answer, Detective.

00:28.037 --> 00:29.471
It's not my fault you won't accept it.

00:29.539 --> 00:30.539
CHLOE: What happened with Lucifer?

00:30.607 --> 00:31.707
You don't get it, do you?

00:31.774 --> 00:33.842
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

00:33.910 --> 00:36.144
LUCIFER: Where's your
ex, Detective Douche?

00:36.213 --> 00:37.157
Hi, Daddy.

00:37.180 --> 00:38.112
Hi, munchkin.

00:38.180 --> 00:39.414
CHLOE: Wow, shocker, you're late.

00:39.481 --> 00:41.048
Come on, give me a break.

00:41.116 --> 00:42.250
Right, here's the deal.

00:42.318 --> 00:45.587
We can have as much naked
cuddle time as you desire,

00:45.654 --> 00:47.622
but you're gonna
have to listen to me too.

00:47.690 --> 00:49.357
LINDA: You like to hide insecurity

00:49.425 --> 00:50.458
in humor, don't you?

00:50.526 --> 00:51.966
What do you think I'm insecure about?

00:51.993 --> 00:53.661
That you are changing,

00:53.729 --> 00:55.362
that you don't know what's
causing the change.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.331
Or who.

00:58.128 --> 01:01.081

01:01.319 --> 01:05.519

01:05.916 --> 01:08.994

01:09.877 --> 01:11.877
(wind whistling)

01:27.894 --> 01:29.827
Go on.

01:29.895 --> 01:32.364
Go ahead, jump.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.100
You know you want to.

01:36.168 --> 01:37.902
Hmm?

01:37.970 --> 01:41.105
Trust me, it's a warm welcome.

01:41.173 --> 01:42.374
Won't it hurt?

01:42.441 --> 01:45.909
Oh, there's only one way to find out.

01:51.616 --> 01:55.319

Everyone's here to see you.

02:20.075 --> 02:22.311
What's the worst that can happen?

02:22.378 --> 02:23.912
Come on, have one drink with me.

02:23.979 --> 02:25.947
I can't, I'm sorry, I'm
not trying to be a buzzkill,

02:26.015 --> 02:27.549
I'm just... I'm not in
the mood to party, all right?

02:27.617 --> 02:30.151
How can you decline this ravishing siren's

02:30.219 --> 02:31.953
invitation to imbibe?

02:32.021 --> 02:35.424
(chuckles) Well, if
L.A.'s taught me anything,

02:35.491 --> 02:37.758
constant rejections do build character.

02:37.826 --> 02:39.460
LUCIFER: Sincerely
doubt "constant rejection"

02:39.528 --> 02:41.061
is something you ever deal with.

02:41.129 --> 02:42.330
(chuckles)

02:42.397 --> 02:44.332
You could learn a
thing or two from this guy.

02:44.399 --> 02:46.334
Oh. (chuckles)

02:46.401 --> 02:48.068
Witty, charming and wise.

02:48.136 --> 02:49.169
Have you lost your mind?

02:49.237 --> 02:50.938
Do I know you?

02:51.005 --> 02:52.172
Lucifer.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.406
Morningstar.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.275
Right, you're the club owner guy

02:56.344 --> 02:57.510
who grants people favors.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.246
Yeah, I don't need anything from you.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.349
Oh, I beg to differ, Ty.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.750
I have been looking for you all night.

03:03.818 --> 03:05.752
And you are in desperate need of my help.

03:05.820 --> 03:08.455
Star quarterback, number-one
draft pick,

03:08.522 --> 03:11.223
and yet, for some
inexplicable reason, a virgin.

03:11.290 --> 03:12.991
Look, man, I got all the
haters I need online, all right?

03:13.059 --> 03:15.427
No, no, no, no, no, I'm not criticizing.

03:15.495 --> 03:16.528
I'm fascinated.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.130
I mean, do you know how rare you are?

03:19.198 --> 03:21.633
A celebrity virgin in Los Angeles,

03:21.701 --> 03:23.134
and surrounded by temptation.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.371
I mean, you, Ty, are like

03:25.438 --> 03:27.772
a four-leaf clover and
a unicorn made a baby.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.241
Without, uh, having sex, of course.

03:30.308 --> 03:31.909
(wry chuckle)

03:31.977 --> 03:33.043
MAN: Aw, thanks, I appreciate it.

03:33.111 --> 03:34.645
My agent wanted me to throw this party.

03:34.713 --> 03:35.980
Oh.

03:36.047 --> 03:38.516
- Yeah, he wants me to loosen up.
- He's right.

03:38.584 --> 03:40.017
I've met your type before,

03:40.085 --> 03:41.619
so desperate to control their lives,

03:41.687 --> 03:42.953
they forget to enjoy it.

03:43.021 --> 03:45.188
So answer me this.

03:45.256 --> 03:48.892
If you were to ever, you know, let go,

03:48.959 --> 03:51.561
what is it you'd really want to do?

03:51.629 --> 03:53.497
I, uh...

03:53.564 --> 03:55.432
- Yeah.
- I...

03:55.500 --> 03:57.768
I want to skip my
morning workout sometimes.

03:57.835 --> 04:00.003
- Boring.
- Just chill on the couch

04:00.070 --> 04:01.070
and watch Master Chef.

04:01.105 --> 04:02.505
This is the fantasy life

04:02.572 --> 04:03.773
of a postmenopausal housewife.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.275
Come on, Ty, there must
be something deeper.

04:06.342 --> 04:07.777
I, um...

04:07.844 --> 04:09.645
Yeah.

04:09.713 --> 04:11.781
I want to get laid so damn bad.

04:11.848 --> 04:13.682
(laughing) And there it is.

04:13.750 --> 04:17.185
You got no idea how hard it
is holding out for marriage, man.

04:17.253 --> 04:19.253
Uncomfortably hard, I'm sure.

04:19.321 --> 04:21.055
(both chuckle)

04:21.123 --> 04:22.791
Look, I was going to with my girl,

04:22.858 --> 04:24.526
but, uh, we broke up.

04:24.593 --> 04:25.593
Oh...

04:25.594 --> 04:26.528
I thought she was gonna be

04:26.595 --> 04:27.829
the mother of my children.

04:27.897 --> 04:29.857
Well, she wants to be the
mother of your children.

04:29.865 --> 04:31.800
Come on, Ty, it's the fourth quarter,

04:31.867 --> 04:33.968
but you can still win this game.

04:34.036 --> 04:36.036
I mean, look at her, death and taxes

04:36.103 --> 04:37.438
are less of a sure thing.

04:37.505 --> 04:38.672
No, I can't.

04:38.740 --> 04:39.940
But you desire her.

04:40.007 --> 04:41.341
Why fight it?

04:41.409 --> 04:44.177
Because my mother taught me that...

04:44.245 --> 04:46.413
Oh, no, don't-don't bring
her into this that's disgusting.

04:46.481 --> 04:49.416
Uh... it's about you.

04:49.484 --> 04:50.951
What do you want?

04:52.253 --> 04:53.085
Her.

04:53.153 --> 04:55.421
Well, then "carpe diem," my friend.

05:02.896 --> 05:04.831
Ah, hello again, my little cannonball.

05:04.898 --> 05:06.833
Sorry, I didn't introduce myself earlier.

05:09.669 --> 05:10.836
Yes, yes.

05:10.903 --> 05:12.971
I'm the Devil, hope
you'll hold it against me.

05:13.038 --> 05:16.274
Lucifer Morningstar,
the guy who owns Lux?

05:16.342 --> 05:17.175
That's me.

05:17.242 --> 05:18.443
(laughing) No, it's not.

05:18.511 --> 05:20.345
I've seen him before.

05:20.412 --> 05:21.580
His beats are sick.

05:21.647 --> 05:23.348
I very much beg your pardon.

05:23.415 --> 05:24.415
Beats?

05:24.416 --> 05:25.617
Yeah.

05:25.685 --> 05:27.451
He performed at a rap
battle last week in the Valley.

05:27.519 --> 05:30.955
Every single part of
that sentence horrifies me.

05:31.022 --> 05:32.957
It is so gross

05:33.024 --> 05:35.392
that you're pretending to
be someone you're not.

Are you doing homework?

Um, sort of.

06:48.996 --> 06:50.897
What's the assignment?

06:52.298 --> 06:55.968
Uh, well, I saw Lucifer do
some things I can't explain.

06:56.036 --> 06:57.502
Is Lucifer a magician?

06:57.571 --> 06:59.371
That's sort of what I'm
trying to figure out.

06:59.439 --> 07:02.041
When Daddy gets here, maybe he can help.

07:02.108 --> 07:03.141
Mm.

07:03.209 --> 07:04.710
Sometimes Daddy helps
me with my homework.

I'm not sure if Daddy has the
answers to these questions.

07:07.313 --> 07:09.480
Why don't you just ask Lucifer?

07:09.548 --> 07:12.817
Because if he's a magician,
then he won't reveal his secrets.

07:12.885 --> 07:15.620
So I have to find out on
my own how Lucifer does...

07:15.688 --> 07:19.057
- (cell phone rings, buzzes)
- these things that I can't...

07:19.124 --> 07:21.092

Lucifer, how did you
even get this number?

07:31.168 --> 07:33.103
LUCIFER: Excuse the mess,

07:33.170 --> 07:36.106
but it's so good of you to
come, Detective Decker.

07:36.173 --> 07:40.110

super-cryptic in a really unhelpful way.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.627
TY: Um, well, I woke up
early, 'cause my head hurt.

08:27.695 --> 08:28.695
I, uh...

08:28.696 --> 08:30.430
I had a hangover.

08:30.498 --> 08:32.166
I... I've never drank before, so...

08:32.234 --> 08:34.668
That's on me. Sorry.

08:34.736 --> 08:36.269
Yeah, so I came down to get some water,

08:36.337 --> 08:38.004
and that's-that's when
I saw her in the pool.

08:38.072 --> 08:39.072
Did you know her?

08:39.106 --> 08:40.573
Not before last night.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.308
I talked to her for a little bit.

08:42.376 --> 08:44.310
Her name was, uh...

08:44.378 --> 08:45.678
Ali, maybe?

08:45.746 --> 08:48.748
I don't know. I mean, I'm
having a hard time remembering.

08:51.252 --> 08:52.918
You think she accidentally slipped,

08:52.986 --> 08:54.319
fell in the pool and drowned?

08:54.387 --> 08:55.720
No, I think she was murdered.

08:55.788 --> 08:57.722
Oh, my God, that's... that's terrible.

08:57.790 --> 09:00.725
So why didn't you call
the police right away?

09:00.793 --> 09:02.294
Well, I told Lucifer.

09:02.362 --> 09:03.929
He said... he said that
he would call the police.

09:03.997 --> 09:04.997
LUCIFER: And I did.

09:04.998 --> 09:06.831
Detective Decker's a homicide detective.

She's been very helpful

that I've encountered.

09:11.436 --> 09:14.238
I am not your personal police concierge.

09:22.281 --> 09:23.801
First things last. Do you have any idea

09:23.815 --> 09:25.116
who had contact with her last night?

09:25.183 --> 09:28.851
Um, no, uh, no, but they asked
me to get the... the guest list.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.289
(quietly) Oh, geez.

09:32.356 --> 09:33.589
250 guests.

09:33.657 --> 09:34.791
You know what that means.

09:34.858 --> 09:36.226
Great party.

09:37.328 --> 09:40.230
250 suspects.

09:41.332 --> 09:43.299
Oh. Uh, I'd be careful with that thing

09:43.366 --> 09:44.599
in the guest bedroom.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.147
There's a good chance you'll go blind.

09:46.202 --> 09:47.636
Unspeakable acts.

09:47.703 --> 09:49.972
Yes, we got a little
carried away. (chuckles)

09:50.040 --> 09:52.341
Stop interfering.

09:52.409 --> 09:53.608
I'm helping.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.910
You forget that my expertise

09:54.978 --> 09:56.745
is finding the right
people to punish, Detective.

09:56.813 --> 09:57.546
It's what I do.

09:57.613 --> 09:59.448
Or, uh, did, at least.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.982
You want to do something?

10:01.050 --> 10:03.151
Then help account for
everyone who was at the party.

10:03.218 --> 10:04.885
- Oh.
- Coroner puts the time of death

10:04.954 --> 10:06.154
between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.

10:06.221 --> 10:07.388
Actually, is there someone

10:07.456 --> 10:09.296
who can vouch for your
whereabouts at the time?

10:09.358 --> 10:11.192
Several someones, in fact.

10:11.260 --> 10:12.293
Yes.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.395
Get them to tell you every little detail

10:14.463 --> 10:16.130
just to make sure that I'm not lying.

10:16.198 --> 10:19.132
I'll have someone else handle that.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.469
So... a bona fide killer on the
loose that needs to be punished.

10:22.536 --> 10:23.494
Time to punch in.

10:23.504 --> 10:25.305
There she is.

10:25.373 --> 10:27.774
Do you know anyone here?

10:27.842 --> 10:29.576
No. Sorry.

10:29.643 --> 10:31.578
I mean, people just
show up to these things.

10:31.645 --> 10:33.246
Did anyone look suspicious?

10:33.314 --> 10:34.750
(scoffs) Where do we start, Detective?

10:34.751 --> 10:36.648
I mean, look at those big strong hands.

10:36.716 --> 10:38.516
Perfect for squeezing
the life out of someone.

10:38.518 --> 10:41.187
Oh, ginger lad.

10:41.254 --> 10:42.455
Soulless bastards.

10:42.522 --> 10:44.190
Give even me the creeps.

10:44.257 --> 10:45.458
I...

10:45.525 --> 10:47.326
You need to sit with the witnesses.

10:48.295 --> 10:49.462
LUCIFER: Haven't I proven myself

10:49.529 --> 10:50.809
extremely useful at detectiving?

10:50.864 --> 10:53.999
Actually, no, I don't need
your help color-commentating.

10:54.066 --> 10:55.600
I need facts and hard evidence.

10:55.667 --> 10:58.103
So unless you can help
me with either, stay.

10:58.170 --> 11:01.072
But I don't want to be stuck
out here with these miscreants.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.673
These are your people.

11:02.741 --> 11:04.923
Detective!

11:18.491 --> 11:20.224
Hey.

11:20.291 --> 11:21.558
I heard all hands on deck.

11:21.626 --> 11:23.360
I came as quick as I could.

11:23.428 --> 11:24.895
Yeah, and on time.

11:26.330 --> 11:28.331
Look, Chloe, I'm sorry
about earlier, okay?

11:28.399 --> 11:29.965
I got held up at an arrest in Hollywood.

11:30.034 --> 11:31.100
I couldn't get away.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.168
I get it, Dan.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.369
Save the apologies for Trixie.

11:33.437 --> 11:34.703
This is work, and right now,

11:34.771 --> 11:36.639
we have a victim with
no fingerprints on file.

11:36.706 --> 11:39.342
These all the unclaimed
items from the party?

11:39.410 --> 11:41.044
Yeah, I checked everything.

11:41.111 --> 11:43.611
Unfortunately, no I.D.
that matches our victim.

11:43.679 --> 11:45.113
So, what are you thinking?

11:45.181 --> 11:48.216
Well, I'm thinking our victim

11:48.284 --> 11:50.419
wore a cute red dress.

11:50.486 --> 11:53.221
There's no way she'd
have that pink clutch.

11:53.289 --> 11:54.523
She was out to have fun,

11:54.590 --> 11:57.125
so that nixes anything
big and bulky, like a tote.

11:57.193 --> 11:59.193
I don't know.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.062
I'm looking for something small,

12:01.129 --> 12:02.229
a little sexy...

12:02.297 --> 12:04.098
classy.

12:04.166 --> 12:06.667
Something like this.

12:06.734 --> 12:07.935
Wait a minute, I-I thought you said

12:08.002 --> 12:09.303
all this stuff was
searched already for I.D.

12:09.371 --> 12:10.871
I'm not looking for an I.D.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.173
I'm looking for a car.

12:12.240 --> 12:15.709
(car alarm chirps)

12:15.777 --> 12:18.010
Ali Thornton, 23, from Boise, Idaho.

12:18.079 --> 12:19.399
Her info matches the registration

12:19.413 --> 12:20.680
we found in the glove box.

12:20.747 --> 12:21.747
Hmm.

12:21.748 --> 12:23.550
She was a long way from home.

12:24.418 --> 12:26.619
What were you doing here, Ali?

12:27.754 --> 12:29.255
I'll see what I can find on her.

12:29.323 --> 12:30.423
Detectives,

12:30.491 --> 12:31.971
found something in the master bedroom.

12:37.630 --> 12:38.830
Found this here in the bed.

12:38.898 --> 12:42.434
And it matches the missing
fingernail of the victim.

12:43.536 --> 12:45.003
Isn't this Ty's bedroom?

12:45.071 --> 12:50.441
Yeah, looks like they
did a lot more than talk.

12:50.509 --> 12:52.510
(woman moaning passionately nearby)

12:56.815 --> 12:58.916
(Lucifer moans with pleasure,
as woman's moans continue)

12:58.984 --> 13:00.884
What the hell are you doing?

13:00.952 --> 13:03.488
Well, since you banished
me outside with the lepers,

13:03.555 --> 13:05.623
I decided to make myself useful.

13:05.690 --> 13:08.458
You call watching porn
on your phone useful?

13:08.526 --> 13:10.227
This isn't my phone, Detective.

13:10.294 --> 13:12.329
I think it's our recently departed's.

13:16.900 --> 13:18.001
Where did you get this?

13:18.068 --> 13:19.908
Just heard a ringy-ding
and followed the noise.

13:19.937 --> 13:20.807
Now, is delete the little

13:20.832 --> 13:21.562
- rubbish bin?
- No.

13:21.606 --> 13:23.673
You can't delete anything on this phone.

13:23.741 --> 13:25.374
But it shows Ty and Ali having sex.

13:25.442 --> 13:26.942
It's very distracting.

13:27.010 --> 13:28.010
(quietly) Wait.

13:28.011 --> 13:29.211
Ooh, you've reached the money shot?

13:29.279 --> 13:31.514
Are you taping this?

13:33.283 --> 13:35.117
TY: I don't know.

13:35.185 --> 13:37.186
Over there, we had a drink.

13:37.254 --> 13:39.522
And I didn't know the girl that well.

13:41.390 --> 13:43.258
Where are you going?

13:43.325 --> 13:45.860
Detective!

13:45.927 --> 13:47.762
Hey!

13:47.829 --> 13:49.181
What's going on?

13:49.206 --> 13:50.557
Detective, you're making a mistake.

13:50.599 --> 13:51.799
Stay out of this, Lucifer.

13:51.867 --> 13:53.067
Cuff him.

13:53.135 --> 13:54.235
- Wait, what?
- Ty Huntley,

13:54.260 --> 13:55.260
you're under arrest

13:55.271 --> 13:56.371
for the murder of Ali Thornton.

13:56.438 --> 13:57.905
This is ridiculous. Lucifer,

13:57.973 --> 13:59.906
this is all your fault.
I wish I'd never met you.

14:15.491 --> 14:17.425
(sighs) Trust me, Detective.

14:17.493 --> 14:18.893
I have been doing this a long time.

14:18.961 --> 14:20.194
I know evil.

14:20.262 --> 14:21.363
You've arrested the wrong man.

14:21.430 --> 14:23.297
The person responsible
is still out there.

14:23.365 --> 14:24.531
How are you so sure?

14:24.599 --> 14:26.467
What desire would Ty have to kill a girl

14:26.534 --> 14:28.268
giving him a wonderful time?

14:28.336 --> 14:30.270
Ty had a squeaky-clean image.

14:30.338 --> 14:32.439
He sleeps with a girl.

14:32.507 --> 14:34.107
Then he finds out she's taping him.

14:34.175 --> 14:35.776
She's gonna ruin everything.

14:35.844 --> 14:37.277
He gets angry and loses control.

14:37.345 --> 14:38.379
You saw the video.

14:38.446 --> 14:40.046
The only thing that that video proves

14:40.114 --> 14:41.180
is that Ty had sex.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.282
He was horny, not murderous.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.590
Then why would he lie about it?

14:44.618 --> 14:46.218
Blame the tequila.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.454
He had motive and opportunity.

14:48.522 --> 14:50.590
Look, I just want to make sure

14:50.657 --> 14:52.291
that you're punishing the right person.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.459
I will.

14:53.527 --> 14:54.694
That's what I do.

14:54.762 --> 14:56.596
Lovely, we want the same thing.

14:56.663 --> 14:57.729

14:57.797 --> 14:58.730

14:58.798 --> 14:59.898
No more porn. I'm good.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.366
No, it's not that. We
should look into it...

15:01.434 --> 15:02.734
"We," as in the LAPD,

Detective Chloe Decker, LAPD.

18:37.871 --> 18:40.538
I'm here to see Ty
Huntley's agent, Joe Hanson.

18:40.607 --> 18:41.539
I'm sorry, without an appointment...

18:41.608 --> 18:42.608
(laughter nearby)

18:42.675 --> 18:44.242
LUCIFER: Let me get this
right... your clients

18:44.310 --> 18:46.111
do all the work, yet you
chaps make all the money?

18:46.178 --> 18:48.413
- Really?
- And they call me the Devil!

18:48.481 --> 18:49.481
(laughter)

18:49.515 --> 18:51.182
If I ever return to Hell,

18:51.250 --> 18:53.218
you kids will be my first call.

18:53.285 --> 18:54.987
Especially you.

18:55.054 --> 18:56.353
Oh, one last thing before I go.

18:56.421 --> 18:58.589
Which of you is into
killing attractive redheads?

18:58.657 --> 19:01.092
- (coughs)
- Lucifer?

19:01.159 --> 19:02.326
Detective!

19:02.393 --> 19:05.295

Oh?

19:08.634 --> 19:10.334
What the hell do you think you're doing?

Finding, then punishing Ali
Thornton's actual killer.

19:12.970 --> 19:14.738
How did you know to come to this agency?

19:14.805 --> 19:16.045
I tried to tell you, Detective.

19:16.073 --> 19:17.874
On the dead girl's
phone. She called here...

19:17.942 --> 19:19.575
Here and traded calls with Ty's agency

19:19.644 --> 19:20.877
a few hours before she was killed.

19:20.945 --> 19:22.345
I know, I checked her phone records.

19:22.346 --> 19:23.346
And you're welcome.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.614
I also able found out that the call

19:24.682 --> 19:26.182
was transferred to
Ty's agent, Joe Hanson.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.584
Right, so why did the dead
girl even know Ty's agent?

19:28.653 --> 19:30.185
I mean, she was Ty's one night stand.

19:30.253 --> 19:31.553
It hardly makes sense.

19:31.621 --> 19:33.022
Well, that's what I'm here to find out.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.489
And that's why you can go now.

19:34.557 --> 19:36.125
(laughing)

19:36.192 --> 19:38.060
What's so funny?

19:38.128 --> 19:39.528
Well, the fact that
you think I'm gonna go.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.996
It's hilarious actually.

19:42.331 --> 19:44.166
Lucifer, I don't need your help.

19:44.233 --> 19:45.801
Look, I'm not trying
to solve this for you.

19:45.869 --> 19:50.071
I'm ensuring that the right
person is held responsible.

19:50.139 --> 19:53.247
Look, come on, I've been helpful
before, haven't I, Detective?

19:53.248 --> 19:54.976
You step out of line one time...

19:55.044 --> 19:56.678
You can give me a right-good
spanking, I promise.

19:56.745 --> 19:59.147
Come on, let's go.

19:59.214 --> 20:01.348
MAN: Ty wouldn't do something like this.

20:01.416 --> 20:02.616
He's such a good kid.

20:02.685 --> 20:04.450
I'm actually more curious
about you, Mr. Hanson.

20:04.518 --> 20:05.552
Me? (chuckles)

20:05.619 --> 20:07.054
Why? I didn't even go to the party.

20:07.121 --> 20:08.454
I had to work.

20:08.522 --> 20:10.623
CHLOE: You spoke to the victim a
few hours before she was killed.

20:10.692 --> 20:14.427
Maybe it's best if I don't say
anything without my attorney.

20:14.495 --> 20:16.196
Joey! Joe, Joe.

20:16.263 --> 20:17.564
There's no need for that.

20:17.631 --> 20:19.499
Why don't you

20:19.567 --> 20:21.567
tell me what you really want, hmm?

20:21.634 --> 20:25.637
What desires drive a
man such as yourself?

20:28.541 --> 20:32.011
I want to be the greatest
agent of all time.

20:32.079 --> 20:33.645
Really?

20:33.714 --> 20:34.814
And to do that,

20:34.881 --> 20:38.016
I need to protect my clients.

20:38.084 --> 20:39.818
Come on.

20:41.453 --> 20:42.954
And, uh...

20:43.022 --> 20:45.757
If you want to protect
Ty, tell us what you know.

20:50.796 --> 20:52.997
(chuckles) Let's make a deal.

20:53.065 --> 20:55.933
I'll tell you everything.
You look into something.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Here's a deal.

20:57.001 --> 20:58.301
Tell us everything, and I don't

20:58.369 --> 20:59.703
cuff you in front of your
co-workers and take you in.

20:59.771 --> 21:00.971
I know how this goes.

21:01.039 --> 21:03.240
Ali's a young actress
looking for a break.

21:03.307 --> 21:05.843
An agent promises to
help her out, in exchange,

21:05.910 --> 21:08.230
she's treated them like a party
favor to your star clients.

21:08.246 --> 21:09.980
Okay, okay.

21:10.048 --> 21:12.481
I did call Ali.

21:12.549 --> 21:14.583
I hired her to have sex with Ty.

21:14.651 --> 21:16.152
Wow, seems I wasn't the only one

21:16.220 --> 21:18.755
who wanted the young
virgin to loosen up.

21:18.822 --> 21:20.656
No, I loved the virgin angle.

21:20.724 --> 21:23.159
It's a clean hook, got
him a lot of attention.

21:24.294 --> 21:27.396
But Ty was a mess.

21:27.464 --> 21:28.764
I needed him

21:28.831 --> 21:31.099
to get over his ex.

21:31.167 --> 21:32.234
Why?

21:34.470 --> 21:35.771
Geez.

21:35.838 --> 21:38.606
Popular boy, this Ty... isn't he?

21:38.674 --> 21:41.509
So what, did this anger
his ex or something?

21:41.577 --> 21:44.880
No, it's from his ex,

21:44.947 --> 21:46.914
Debra Macall. She left this behind

21:46.982 --> 21:48.548
one of the many times she came here

21:48.616 --> 21:49.984
trying to find him.

21:50.051 --> 21:51.752
She used to call all the time
trying to get a hold of him.

21:51.820 --> 21:53.087
So, he dated a crazy fan?

21:53.155 --> 21:55.189
He didn't know it at the beginning.

21:55.257 --> 21:57.925
So when I figured it out, he
had already fallen for her.

21:57.993 --> 22:00.394
Oh, suppose I can understand why.

22:00.461 --> 22:01.628
(chuckles)

22:01.696 --> 22:03.529
JOE: See, after a while,
Debra got possessive,

22:03.597 --> 22:04.597
controlling...

22:04.631 --> 22:06.199
she thought she was managing him.

22:06.267 --> 22:08.401
So I told Ty he needed
to break up with her.

22:08.468 --> 22:09.936
He refused.

22:10.004 --> 22:12.672
I made Ty file a restraining order

22:12.739 --> 22:14.274
after she broke a girl's nose

22:14.341 --> 22:15.574
just for buying him a mojito.

22:15.642 --> 22:17.243
Quite a hair trigger on this Debra,

22:17.311 --> 22:19.279
- by the sounds of it.
- Hmm.

22:19.346 --> 22:21.613
If Debra found out

22:21.681 --> 22:23.882
that Ty was with that poor girl...

22:30.756 --> 22:33.325
Hmm. Finally, some rain.

22:33.392 --> 22:35.527
Maybe someone up there
is looking out for us.

22:35.594 --> 22:36.828
I can assure you,

22:36.895 --> 22:39.430
He's in no way
meteorologically inclined.

22:39.497 --> 22:40.737
Apart from the whole Noah thing,

22:40.765 --> 22:42.967
and that was a one-off.

22:47.405 --> 22:48.472
Anyhow, her roommate confirmed

22:48.540 --> 22:50.241
that she took the 4:00 p.m. class, so...

22:50.309 --> 22:52.609
Ty's ex should be out any second now.

22:52.677 --> 22:54.644
I told you you had the wrong man.

22:54.712 --> 22:56.446
Wrong gender as well, apparently.

22:56.513 --> 22:57.714
Finally, we're getting warmer.

22:57.781 --> 23:00.717
Why are you so hell-bent on
proving Ty's not the killer?

23:00.784 --> 23:01.784
Like I've been saying,

23:01.785 --> 23:03.586
I want to punish the real killer.

23:03.654 --> 23:04.955
But why?

23:05.022 --> 23:06.456
Is it 'cause you pushed him
towards Ali at the party?

23:06.523 --> 23:09.259
Well, I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

23:09.327 --> 23:10.693
And I think you're
starting to agree with me.

23:10.761 --> 23:12.594
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, would you?

23:12.662 --> 23:13.863
- Bye!
- Bye!

23:13.930 --> 23:15.898
CHLOE: There she is.

23:15.966 --> 23:19.001
(women conversing
indistinctly in distance)

23:19.069 --> 23:20.369
That was great. I'll call you at lunch.

23:20.436 --> 23:22.637
- I'm over here.
- CHLOE: Debra Macall?

23:22.705 --> 23:24.039
I'm Detective Decker, LAPD.

23:24.107 --> 23:26.275
We need to ask you a few
questions about Ty Huntley.

23:26.343 --> 23:27.776
I've got nothing to say.

23:27.844 --> 23:29.404
It's either here or down at the station.

23:29.444 --> 23:31.112
- Leave me alone!
- CHLOE: Debra...

23:35.550 --> 23:37.785
(car alarm blaring, horn honking)

23:39.021 --> 23:40.955
See?

23:41.023 --> 23:42.590
Warmer.

23:55.180 --> 23:56.460
Found this on the undercarriage.

23:56.515 --> 23:57.881
Remote detonator.

23:57.949 --> 24:00.584
Whoever set off this bomb was nearby.

24:00.651 --> 24:02.252
Scour the security cameras in the area.

24:02.320 --> 24:06.223
Get facial I.D.'s on anyone
in a hundred-block radius.

24:06.290 --> 24:07.924
LUCIFER: You couldn't live with
yourself for committing murder,

24:07.992 --> 24:09.792
so you set your car
to explode, didn't you?

24:09.860 --> 24:11.861
Eh? Wanted to go out
in a blaze of glory.

24:11.929 --> 24:12.762
Of course not!

24:12.830 --> 24:15.265
Murder? What are you talking about?

24:15.333 --> 24:16.532
LUCIFER: Oh, come on...

24:16.600 --> 24:17.880
The bomb was triggered remotely.

24:17.934 --> 24:20.302
Whoever set it off did it
before you got to the car.

24:20.370 --> 24:21.604
There's a clear line of sight.

24:21.671 --> 24:23.272
I don't think the plan was to kill you.

24:23.340 --> 24:24.840
I think they wanted to scare you.

24:24.907 --> 24:27.643
So... you know of any reason why
someone would want to do that?

24:27.710 --> 24:29.645
No.

24:29.712 --> 24:31.247
Yes, why did you run, Debra?

24:31.314 --> 24:32.814
Awfully guilty-looking.

24:33.882 --> 24:35.242
I thought you were going to bust me

24:35.284 --> 24:36.644
for violating my restraining order.

24:37.620 --> 24:39.420
I went to Ty's party last night.

24:40.356 --> 24:41.556
I-I just... I just looked.

24:41.624 --> 24:42.990
From outside, through the window.

24:43.058 --> 24:44.058
I couldn't help it, I miss him.

24:44.126 --> 24:46.528
Yes, breaking up's so hard, isn't it?

24:46.595 --> 24:48.329
You're like two pathetic peas in a pod.

24:48.397 --> 24:50.131
Okay, we are made for each other.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.632
As good as he is at football,

24:51.699 --> 24:53.800
that's how good I am
at being his girlfriend.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.302
You mean ex-girlfriend.

24:55.370 --> 24:57.337
We never stay broken
up. It's just a phase.

24:57.405 --> 25:00.073
And no one looks out for
him the way that I do.

25:00.141 --> 25:03.210
And then I saw him
kissing that girl and I...

25:03.278 --> 25:04.311
Squeezed the life out of her?

25:04.379 --> 25:05.812
DEBRA: No!

25:06.814 --> 25:07.746
Where were you between

25:07.814 --> 25:09.054
1:00 and 3:00 a.m. this morning?

25:10.651 --> 25:13.786
The only place that always
makes me feel better.

25:13.853 --> 25:15.854
(sobbing)

25:18.124 --> 25:19.425
DAN: How long does this go on?

25:19.493 --> 25:20.793
CHLOE: Three hours.

25:20.860 --> 25:22.728
(wry laugh)

25:22.796 --> 25:24.356
That's the saddest thing I've ever seen.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.798
CHLOE: Yep. All-night froyo shop

25:26.865 --> 25:29.167
puts Debra there well past
the time of the victim's death.

25:29.235 --> 25:30.735
Her alibi checks out.

25:32.137 --> 25:34.072
So Debra didn't strangle Ali.

25:34.139 --> 25:35.873
Well, whoever planted the bomb

25:35.941 --> 25:38.210
went to great lengths to
make us think Debra did it.

25:38.277 --> 25:39.744
Why?

25:39.812 --> 25:40.812
I don't know.

25:44.316 --> 25:48.319
We might actually know
who rigged the car.

25:50.822 --> 25:51.822
Ronnie Hillman.

25:52.990 --> 25:55.092
CHLOE: The big Hollywood fixer?

25:55.159 --> 25:56.159
Yeah.

25:56.228 --> 25:57.261
A security cam caught her

25:57.329 --> 25:58.969
walking nearby, right
after the explosion.

25:59.029 --> 26:00.149
This can't be a coincidence.

26:00.197 --> 26:01.557
Someone must've hired her for this.

26:01.565 --> 26:03.866
I've been trying to build
a case on her for years,

26:03.934 --> 26:05.335
and every time we've approached her,

26:05.402 --> 26:07.270
she's lawyered up immediately.

26:07.338 --> 26:08.538
Ronnie is a pro.

26:08.606 --> 26:09.805
So how do we approach her?

26:09.873 --> 26:11.107
She's picky about talking to strangers.

26:11.174 --> 26:13.743
Definitely no cops.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.514
What about someone

26:19.582 --> 26:22.117
she'd never expect us to work with?

26:22.184 --> 26:23.918
LUCIFER: Do I get a code word?

26:23.986 --> 26:25.987
You know, for when you take her down.

26:26.055 --> 26:27.922
If so, might I suggest

26:27.990 --> 26:29.157
"monkey bottoms"?

26:29.225 --> 26:30.505
'Cause trust me, I can work that

26:30.560 --> 26:31.593
into any sentence quite naturally.

26:31.661 --> 26:33.561
You sure this is a good idea?

26:33.629 --> 26:34.862
Lucifer reached out to her

26:34.929 --> 26:36.964
and she agreed to meet
him, so it's our best shot.

26:37.031 --> 26:39.767
And you won't need a code
word, and you won't be miked,

26:39.834 --> 26:41.302
because she'll be looking for that.

26:41.370 --> 26:42.370
This is a simple handoff.

26:42.404 --> 26:44.338
All we need you to do is vouch for Dan

26:44.406 --> 26:45.673
as someone that needs her services.

26:45.741 --> 26:47.475
Vouch for Detective Douche?

26:47.542 --> 26:50.443
Oh, gosh, this is gonna
be harder than I thought.

26:50.511 --> 26:51.911
Once I engage with her, I will hire her

26:51.979 --> 26:52.979
to fix a problem of mine.

26:52.980 --> 26:53.980
Right.

26:54.014 --> 26:55.315
Well, if it's that stick up your ass,

26:55.383 --> 26:57.350
I'm afraid there's no one
strong enough to pull that out.

26:57.418 --> 26:58.718
She goes there to fix my problem,

26:58.786 --> 27:00.453
our people will be
waiting to arrest her.

27:00.521 --> 27:01.655
- Ah.
- CHLOE: And then we'll have leverage

27:01.722 --> 27:03.390
to find out what she
knows about Ali's murder.

27:03.457 --> 27:05.024
She has information we need,

27:05.092 --> 27:06.372
so let's just stick to the plan.

27:06.426 --> 27:08.226
Assuming, of course,
Ronnie hasn't run off

27:08.295 --> 27:09.561
because our sting suddenly turned into

27:09.629 --> 27:10.962
a Michael Bublé concert.

27:12.399 --> 27:13.599
Lucifer, this isn't a game.

27:13.667 --> 27:15.834
- Oh.
- Now, are you up for this or not?

27:15.902 --> 27:19.805
Am I up for encouraging someone
to commit a nefarious act?

27:19.872 --> 27:21.340
Mm, let me think.

27:21.408 --> 27:23.275
Put me in, Coach.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.276

28:11.788 --> 28:12.988
(laughs)

28:13.056 --> 28:14.323
Mm, you checking for a wire

28:14.390 --> 28:15.557
or are you just pleased to see me?

28:15.624 --> 28:17.325
(laughs)

28:17.393 --> 28:18.960
Little bit of both.

28:19.027 --> 28:20.127
Mmm! (chuckles)

28:20.195 --> 28:21.863
Hello, Mr. Morningstar.

28:21.930 --> 28:24.332
Rest assured...

28:24.400 --> 28:26.133
I can help you with your problem.

28:26.201 --> 28:28.837
Well, actually, I don't need your help.

28:28.904 --> 28:30.372
I...

28:30.439 --> 28:32.473
Wait, what do you think my problem is?

28:32.540 --> 28:34.375
Impostor running around
ruining your name.

28:34.442 --> 28:37.778
Your professional reputation
has taken a bit of a dive.

28:39.280 --> 28:42.549
As has your sexual one, I'm afraid.

28:42.617 --> 28:44.852
All those unsatisfied ladies...

28:44.919 --> 28:46.787
Word gets around.

28:48.022 --> 28:50.790
That is the reason you
reached out to me, isn't it?

28:55.095 --> 28:56.228
Yes.

28:56.296 --> 28:57.530
Yes, it very much is.

28:57.598 --> 28:59.866
I do have a problem
that could use your help.

28:59.933 --> 29:01.133
I am all yours.

29:01.201 --> 29:03.503
Oh! Well, I like you,
monkey bottoms. (chuckles)

what are you doing?

29:09.074 --> 29:10.275
(music playing over speakers)

29:10.342 --> 29:11.777
Hey, Dan, what's going on?

29:13.446 --> 29:15.013
DAN: I don't know.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.815
They're still talking.

29:19.351 --> 29:21.820
And now she's leaving.

29:24.222 --> 29:25.823
LUCIFER: Lovely.

29:27.125 --> 29:28.826
What the hell did you do?

29:28.894 --> 29:31.962
I hired the fixer to fix
a problem, like you wanted.

29:32.030 --> 29:33.531
You let her go. What
happened to the plan?

29:33.598 --> 29:35.666
- I made a better one.
- How?

29:35.734 --> 29:36.934
Just sit tight

29:37.001 --> 29:38.436
and we'll all get what we want.

29:50.954 --> 29:52.854
- Finally!
- (whimpers)

29:52.922 --> 29:55.490
The would-be Prince of Darkness.

29:55.558 --> 29:57.492
Payment due upon delivery.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.560
(wry laugh)

29:58.561 --> 30:01.129
I'd like to examine the goods first.

30:01.197 --> 30:02.396
RONNIE: Your dime.

30:06.501 --> 30:08.302
Right.

30:08.369 --> 30:10.838
Let's see the face of my impostor.

30:14.209 --> 30:15.710
(Maze laughs)

30:17.212 --> 30:19.245
The resemblance is uncanny.

30:21.849 --> 30:25.485
It most certainly is not.

30:25.552 --> 30:26.620
(giggling)

30:26.687 --> 30:28.554
How could anyone think that you were me?

30:28.623 --> 30:31.290
(false British accent): You
know who you're messing with?

30:31.358 --> 30:33.526
I'm Lucifer freaking Morningstar!

30:33.594 --> 30:35.061
Oh...

30:35.129 --> 30:36.228
Are you now?

30:36.295 --> 30:39.164
Well... you've certainly
been a busy bee,

30:39.232 --> 30:41.366
haven't you, "Lucifer"?

30:41.434 --> 30:42.604
Eh?

30:42.605 --> 30:44.670
Apparently, you've
started a modeling agency,

30:44.738 --> 30:47.539
pitched a Web series.

30:48.775 --> 30:49.942
And I hear you've also been

30:50.010 --> 30:52.044
very active with the women.

30:52.112 --> 30:53.177
Ladies love me.

30:53.245 --> 30:54.679
What can I say?

30:54.747 --> 30:57.414
It's what they've been
saying that's the trouble.

30:57.482 --> 31:00.317
It seems you're a bit
of a two-pump chump.

31:00.385 --> 31:01.653
Also, a crier afterwards.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.587
That happened one time.

31:03.656 --> 31:06.457
Right. Well, we can't
have you running around

31:06.525 --> 31:08.192
cheapening the Lucifer
brand, now, can we?

31:08.260 --> 31:10.560
What do you say, Maze?

31:10.628 --> 31:12.328
Impalement?

31:12.396 --> 31:13.764
MAZE: Hmm...

31:13.831 --> 31:16.299
Why rush?

31:16.367 --> 31:18.234
- I say the rack.
- Oh.

31:18.302 --> 31:19.836
- Oh!
- Ooh.

31:19.904 --> 31:21.237
That way,

31:21.305 --> 31:23.040
we can really enjoy it.

31:23.107 --> 31:24.975
LUCIFER: Better. Yes, much better.

31:25.043 --> 31:27.209
Every joint of every limb

31:27.277 --> 31:29.011
dislocated before it's torn off.

31:29.079 --> 31:32.081
No, no, no, no, no... look,
look, look, I just... I just...

31:32.149 --> 31:34.583
I just wanted to get
chicks and-and free drinks.

31:34.651 --> 31:36.418
Um, really.

31:37.420 --> 31:39.321
(dropping accent) My name is Justin.

31:39.389 --> 31:40.389
I'm from Sherman Oaks.

31:40.390 --> 31:41.523
(Maze and Lucifer laughing)

31:41.591 --> 31:43.692
Oh, Justin...

31:43.759 --> 31:45.459
the things I'm gonna do to you.

31:45.527 --> 31:46.961
Oh, no, no, no, I-I'm sorry!

31:47.029 --> 31:48.196
I only came here one time

31:48.263 --> 31:50.031
and I just told some girls

31:50.099 --> 31:51.399
that I owned the place, and...

31:51.466 --> 31:53.001
and that opened some doors for me

31:53.069 --> 31:54.268
and so I just started rolling with it.

31:54.336 --> 31:57.072
How dare you abscond my name!

31:57.139 --> 31:58.840
Please, don't hurt me.

31:58.908 --> 32:00.175
Please.

32:00.242 --> 32:01.522
LUCIFER: I'm not gonna hurt you,

32:01.542 --> 32:03.844
Justin, I'm going to destroy you.

32:03.912 --> 32:06.146
Oh, this is so hot.

32:06.214 --> 32:09.083
It's like you're punishing yourself.

32:14.455 --> 32:17.591
Seems I could be just, um,

32:17.658 --> 32:19.258
overreacting a bit.

32:23.663 --> 32:25.431
Go.

32:25.498 --> 32:26.665
Go on!

32:28.468 --> 32:30.203
And never sully my name again.

32:34.174 --> 32:35.841
Let's at least take a finger.

32:35.908 --> 32:37.375
We've done enough, Maze.

32:44.483 --> 32:45.951
Pleasure doing business
with you, Lucifer.

32:46.018 --> 32:47.385
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

32:47.453 --> 32:49.955
Which is why I'm going to have
to apologize for my friends.

32:50.022 --> 32:51.123
What friends?

32:51.190 --> 32:52.389
CHLOE: Ronnie Hillman,

32:52.457 --> 32:54.424
you're under arrest for
kidnapping and assault.

32:59.030 --> 33:00.798
Would you mind calling my lawyer?

33:00.866 --> 33:02.986
(handcuffs tightening) Her
number's in my back pocket.

33:03.034 --> 33:04.501
Yeah, sure thing.

33:04.569 --> 33:06.070
I'll tell her about the kidnapping,

33:06.138 --> 33:07.604
the airtight evidence we have,

33:07.672 --> 33:09.572
the attempted murder on Debra Macall,

33:09.640 --> 33:11.760
and then when we connect
you to Ali Thornton's murder,

33:11.809 --> 33:13.209
maybe you'll get a
nice injection of drugs,

33:13.277 --> 33:15.211
and you can go to sleep forever.

33:15.279 --> 33:19.415
Hang on... I had nothing
to do with Ali's murder.

33:19.483 --> 33:23.653
Debra Macall, Ty Huntley's
ex, she's the murderer.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.421
I cared about Ali.

33:25.489 --> 33:26.822
Mm-hmm, here's what I think.

33:26.890 --> 33:29.724
I think you tried to scare Debra
into confessing to Ali's murder,

33:29.793 --> 33:31.026
but Debra didn't do it.

33:31.094 --> 33:32.795
She's got an ironclad alibi.

33:35.832 --> 33:37.732
This is my fault.

33:37.801 --> 33:39.567
Why?

33:39.635 --> 33:43.271
I promised Ali I would protect her.

33:43.338 --> 33:46.040
All she ever wanted
was to be an actress.

33:46.108 --> 33:47.775
She was gonna leave her mark.

33:47.843 --> 33:49.010
But you know how that goes.

33:49.077 --> 33:52.379
Endless rejection, she ran out of money.

33:52.447 --> 33:55.349
This was her first gig with me.

33:55.417 --> 33:57.351
She didn't even know if she could do it.

33:57.419 --> 34:01.621
But I told her... I told
her it was just like acting.

34:01.689 --> 34:04.925
Besides, who doesn't want
to sleep with Ty Huntley?

34:04.992 --> 34:07.627
I thought Ty's agent hired
Ali to sleep with him.

34:07.695 --> 34:10.864
He hired me for a number
three special: blackmail.

34:10.931 --> 34:14.067
Slip him a roofie, get naked,
whip out a selfie stick,

34:14.135 --> 34:15.335
and voilà.

34:15.402 --> 34:17.101
LUCIFER: Why would he have any desire

34:17.170 --> 34:18.637
to blackmail his own star client,

34:18.705 --> 34:20.239
a client he's all about protecting?

34:20.306 --> 34:23.208
Ty's agent told you
that Debra killed Ali.

34:23.275 --> 34:26.178
He did, yeah.

34:35.786 --> 34:37.255
You think Joe's the killer,

34:37.322 --> 34:40.190
that he took things into his
own hands, quite literally.

34:40.259 --> 34:41.391
We don't have any proof.

34:41.460 --> 34:45.029
Right, well, how do you
propose that we get him?

34:46.065 --> 34:47.998
Joe pointed the finger right at Debra,

34:48.067 --> 34:49.266
painted her as crazy.

34:49.335 --> 34:50.801
It's not that hard a picture
to paint, in her case.

34:50.869 --> 34:53.402
Why was he so certain
she'd make a good suspect?

34:53.471 --> 34:56.505
Maybe he found out
she went to Ty's party.

34:56.574 --> 34:59.109
Maybe he knew she went to Ty's party.

35:14.545 --> 35:18.213
You are looking at
the future of football.

35:18.281 --> 35:20.349
The American Dream.

35:20.417 --> 35:24.753
Honest, resilient, heroic.

35:24.820 --> 35:27.022
The police tried to pin

35:27.090 --> 35:31.093
the death of that poor girl on you.

35:31.161 --> 35:33.928
But we kept it out of the press.

35:33.995 --> 35:37.165
We got you out of jail.

35:37.232 --> 35:39.233
We will always protect you...

35:39.301 --> 35:42.203
and make you a bigger star than ever.

35:42.271 --> 35:45.073
This is Ty Huntley...

35:45.140 --> 35:47.641
rebranded. (laughs)

35:53.114 --> 35:54.114
LUCIFER: Rebranded, eh?

35:54.182 --> 35:55.848
Does it come with a new scent?

35:55.916 --> 35:56.983
Free toy inside?

35:57.051 --> 35:58.918
What do you want?

35:58.986 --> 36:01.321
Ty is free on bail.

36:01.389 --> 36:03.457
We have to talk to Ty
down at the station again,

36:03.524 --> 36:05.258
maybe walk him past a few reporters.

36:05.326 --> 36:06.825
Whoa, hold on, uh, Joe, what is this?

36:06.893 --> 36:08.594
Oh, come on! This is ridiculous.

36:08.661 --> 36:10.829
Ty wouldn't hurt anybody!

36:10.897 --> 36:12.098
What about Debra?

36:12.165 --> 36:13.532
I told you to look into her.

36:13.600 --> 36:14.700
She's the crazy one.

36:14.767 --> 36:16.202
Yes, well, I thought
it was her all along.

36:16.269 --> 36:18.471
I mean, the woman certainly
redefines "intensity."

36:18.538 --> 36:21.340
But Debra was home with a
friend the night of the murder.

36:21.408 --> 36:22.475
What?!

36:22.542 --> 36:23.708
She's lying.

36:23.775 --> 36:25.535
There's no evidence
placing her at the party.

36:25.544 --> 36:26.578
No one saw her.

36:26.645 --> 36:29.046
So are you ready to face the cameras?

36:29.115 --> 36:30.582
His sponsors will love
the free publicity.

36:30.649 --> 36:33.585
Tell me, what's ten percent of nothing?

36:33.652 --> 36:35.320
I saw Debra there.

36:36.989 --> 36:40.190
I went by the party.

36:40.258 --> 36:44.661
But a work call came up,
and I never made it inside.

36:44.729 --> 36:46.296
I didn't say anything before

36:46.364 --> 36:49.133
because I told my wife
I was working late.

36:49.200 --> 36:53.270
When I was driving away, I
saw Debra outside Ty's window.

36:53.338 --> 36:55.939
So you admit you were there that night.

36:56.007 --> 36:58.641
Yeah, and so was Debra.

36:58.708 --> 36:59.988
That's the proof you need, right?

37:00.010 --> 37:01.250
CHLOE: That's the proof we need.

37:01.311 --> 37:03.746
We have a sworn statement
from Ronnie Hillman

37:03.813 --> 37:05.014
saying that you hired the victim

37:05.081 --> 37:07.150
to make a sex tape with
Ty to blackmail him.

37:07.217 --> 37:08.651
I just needed to place you at the scene.

37:08.718 --> 37:10.453
LUCIFER: Yeah, see,
that's why I don't lie.

37:10.521 --> 37:12.522
It's so hard to keep
track of who knows what.

37:12.589 --> 37:14.189
It's not true.

37:14.257 --> 37:16.591
I only want what's best for you, Ty.

37:16.659 --> 37:17.892
You know, I still don't understand.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.594
Why is it my own agent
would want to blackmail me?

37:19.662 --> 37:22.464
Because he thought eventually
you were gonna leave him.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.633
What, because I took one
meeting with another agency?

37:25.734 --> 37:26.801
Joe...

37:26.869 --> 37:28.370
I only did that to make Debra happy.

37:28.437 --> 37:29.837
But even though you'd broken up,

37:29.905 --> 37:31.145
he knew you'd get back together,

37:31.173 --> 37:33.907
so he decided to strike
first, get some leverage.

37:33.975 --> 37:37.211
If he left me, I would be ruined.

37:37.279 --> 37:38.945
I mean, do you understand?

37:39.013 --> 37:40.381
He is my Brady, my Manning.

37:40.448 --> 37:43.083
But Ali wasn't cut out for
this sort of thing, was she?

37:43.151 --> 37:44.685
She didn't want to give you the video.

37:44.752 --> 37:46.320
Stupid bitch.

37:48.122 --> 37:50.790
She said she realized Ty was a good guy.

37:50.857 --> 37:52.091
She didn't want to go through with it.

37:52.159 --> 37:55.495
Her name was Ali Thornton,
and you killed her.

37:55.563 --> 37:56.696
For what?

37:56.763 --> 37:58.831
Greed? Ego?

37:58.899 --> 38:00.099
I didn't want to hurt her.

38:00.167 --> 38:02.702
I just wanted her phone. And...

38:02.769 --> 38:04.637
(Joe sighs)

38:09.008 --> 38:11.210
But I squeezed too hard.

38:12.778 --> 38:13.812
I'm done.

38:13.879 --> 38:16.114
Forget this. I'm out of here.

38:20.786 --> 38:23.120
(gasps)

38:23.188 --> 38:25.022
Did I squeeze too hard?

38:26.525 --> 38:28.726
How did you... ?

38:28.793 --> 38:29.993
What did... ?

38:30.061 --> 38:31.995
Lucifer, what are you doing?

38:32.063 --> 38:34.332
Finally focusing my
anger where it belongs.

38:34.399 --> 38:35.433
Lucifer...

38:38.770 --> 38:42.004
(chuckles)

38:42.072 --> 38:44.608
Yes, of course.

38:44.675 --> 38:46.175
Your turn, Detective.

38:46.244 --> 38:49.679
(sirens wailing, radio chatter)

38:55.353 --> 38:57.786
I still can't believe Joe did this.

38:57.854 --> 39:01.624
I wasn't ever gonna
leave him, you know that?

39:01.691 --> 39:03.158
Definitely gonna leave him now.

39:03.226 --> 39:04.893
But you know what, you, uh...

39:04.961 --> 39:06.762
you stayed good to your word, Lucifer.

39:06.829 --> 39:07.929
Thank you.

39:07.997 --> 39:11.066
Yes, well, now you owe me one.

39:13.669 --> 39:15.770
DEBRA: Ty!

39:15.837 --> 39:17.538
Ty! Ty!

39:19.341 --> 39:20.341
Oh, my baby.

39:20.409 --> 39:21.942
Oh, my God, I'm so glad to see you.

39:22.010 --> 39:24.178
- Oh.
- You are?

39:24.246 --> 39:25.613
Yes, you are crazy, baby.

39:25.681 --> 39:28.048
- But you're my crazy, you hear me?
- Yeah?

39:29.752 --> 39:32.185
Warms the cockles, doesn't it?

39:33.721 --> 39:35.054
So, Detective,

39:35.122 --> 39:36.823
looks like you've solved another case

39:36.891 --> 39:37.891
because of me.

39:37.892 --> 39:39.459
I solved this case despite you.

39:39.527 --> 39:41.662
What? What about the cell phone I found?

39:41.729 --> 39:42.929
That was key evidence.

39:42.997 --> 39:44.298
Evidence you almost destroyed.

39:44.365 --> 39:46.866
I got you the leverage
you needed to crack Ronnie.

39:46.934 --> 39:49.302
You co-opted a sting
operation for your own gain.

39:49.369 --> 39:51.737
And I solved another crime.

39:51.805 --> 39:53.906
Identity theft. (chuckles)

39:53.973 --> 39:56.909
Come on, admit it... we
solved this one together.

39:56.976 --> 39:59.712
<i>Or are you too egotistical
to acknowledge my help?</i>

40:01.481 --> 40:04.149
Okay, yeah, you didn't
completely destroy the case.

40:04.217 --> 40:06.618
So you can stop blaming yourself, great.

40:06.686 --> 40:08.119
Whatever do you mean?

40:09.488 --> 40:12.089
The whole reason you tried
to prove Ty's innocence?

40:12.157 --> 40:14.292
Was to catch the true culprit.

40:16.061 --> 40:17.762
Yeah, sure.

40:21.633 --> 40:23.967
LUCIFER: So I decided
not to punish myself.

40:24.035 --> 40:25.703
Yourself?

40:25.770 --> 40:27.938
Well, my fake self.

40:28.005 --> 40:29.239
The person I'd kidnapped.

40:29.307 --> 40:31.508
I decided not to beat him up.

40:31.576 --> 40:34.010
(sighs) You were right, I was, um...

40:34.078 --> 40:35.779
- (sighs loudly with satisfaction)
- What's the word?

40:35.847 --> 40:37.314
Displacing?

40:37.382 --> 40:40.316
Displacing my anger and
frustration on Luci-phony,

40:40.384 --> 40:43.353
because the right person wasn't
being punished for Ali's death.

40:43.420 --> 40:45.355
And who was the right person?

40:45.422 --> 40:48.090
Well, the sleazy agent, of course.

40:48.158 --> 40:50.360
Ah, yeah.

40:50.427 --> 40:53.596
Of all the cities in the world, Lucifer,

40:53.664 --> 40:56.264
why did you decide to
come to Los Angeles?

40:56.332 --> 40:58.266
Well, the same reason as everyone else.

40:58.334 --> 41:00.068
Uh, the weather, porn stars,

41:00.135 --> 41:01.903
Mexican food... mm!

41:01.971 --> 41:03.304
Mmm.

41:03.373 --> 41:05.373
You know, you say... you
say people are phony here,

41:05.375 --> 41:09.310
but I think people come
here to reinvent themselves.

41:09.379 --> 41:11.312
And I think that's why you're here.

41:11.381 --> 41:13.313
To reinvent yourself.

41:13.382 --> 41:16.149
Why would I mess with perfection?

41:17.486 --> 41:20.287
You like working with
the detective, don't you?

41:22.657 --> 41:24.592
I told you, I'm good
at punishing people...

41:24.659 --> 41:27.395
nay, I'm the best at
punishing bad people.

41:27.462 --> 41:29.863
I didn't enjoy it when
my father forced me to,

41:29.930 --> 41:31.865
but now that it's on my own terms,

41:31.932 --> 41:33.666
it's downright delightful.

41:33.734 --> 41:35.869
Yeah, well, I think you don't just enjoy

41:35.936 --> 41:37.670
punishing the bad guys.

41:37.738 --> 41:39.873
I think you're starting
to like seeking justice

41:39.940 --> 41:42.141
for the good ones.

41:45.312 --> 41:46.412
Like Ali.

41:46.479 --> 41:47.646
(Lucifer scoffs)

41:49.482 --> 41:51.149
It's another reason to hate L.A...

41:51.217 --> 41:52.885
all this self indulgent therapy.

41:52.952 --> 41:54.052
You should be ashamed.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.521
You're doing it again.

41:55.588 --> 41:56.622
What?

41:56.689 --> 41:58.356
Displacing.

41:58.425 --> 42:00.158
No, I'm not.

42:00.226 --> 42:01.760
And that's denial.

42:01.828 --> 42:03.961
That's a river in Africa.

42:04.029 --> 42:05.963
