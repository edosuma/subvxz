35:18.683 --> 35:21.481
- What do you want from me?
- Just to be your friend.

35:21.652 --> 35:23.051
Mason would have wanted that.

35:27.158 --> 35:28.750
I know about Mason.

35:30.695 --> 35:31.719
And you.

35:33.231 --> 35:36.200
- You know what?
- I know you're a werewolf.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.359
And I know your little friend,
Caroline...

35:39.904 --> 35:41.030
...is a vampire.

35:41.205 --> 35:45.039
- How do you know about Caroline?
- You can't sniff them out?

35:47.111 --> 35:49.170
Oh, my God...

35:49.347 --> 35:50.507
...you are brand-new.

35:51.749 --> 35:53.341

Hey, I can help you.

36:02.393 --> 36:04.384
Do you know where Mason is?

36:04.562 --> 36:06.689
He's dead, Tyler. He was murdered.

36:07.899 --> 36:09.730
- No.
- You wanna know who murdered him?

36:09.901 --> 36:12.267
- Just stop.
- Your little blond vampire did.

36:12.436 --> 36:14.734
No, Caroline would never do that.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.272
She and her little vampire friends
were behind it.

36:17.441 --> 36:19.409
Caroline is the only vampire in town.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.545
Is that what she told you? She lied.

36:21.712 --> 36:23.612
This town is crawling with vampires.

36:25.416 --> 36:27.646
But don't worry, we'll get them.

36:30.388 --> 36:31.446
Who are you?

36:32.890 --> 36:34.255
I'm your friend.

36:36.460 --> 36:39.224
There are others like us
and they're on their way.

36:49.106 --> 36:50.903
- You were supposed to leave.
ELENA: I did.

36:51.075 --> 36:53.305
Then I came back
to make sure that you're okay.

36:55.146 --> 36:57.842
I appreciate the gesture.

36:58.416 --> 37:00.281
I'm just glad it's over.

37:00.451 --> 37:02.646
You know I don't believe that.

37:03.821 --> 37:07.757
Go home, Elena. Get some rest.
It's a whole new day tomorrow.

37:07.925 --> 37:10.018
- I'm your friend.
- I'm well aware of that.

when their friend is hurting.

What do you wanna hear?
That I cared about Rose?

37:15.199 --> 37:16.689
That I'm upset?

37:16.867 --> 37:19.097
Well, I didn't and I'm not.

There you go, pretending to turn it off,
pretending not to feel.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.598
Damon, you're so close. Don't give up.

37:24.775 --> 37:27.869
I feel, Elena. Okay? And it sucks.

37:29.280 --> 37:32.272
What sucks even more
is that it was supposed to be me.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.680
Jules was coming after me.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.348
You feel guilty.

37:37.521 --> 37:40.490
That would be human of me,
wouldn't it, Elena? I'm not human.

37:40.658 --> 37:44.389
You're one to talk about giving up.
All you've done is give up.

37:45.696 --> 37:46.788
Go home.

37:46.964 --> 37:50.593
There's been enough doom, gloom
and personal growth for one night.

39:34.805 --> 39:37.740
And you're laying
in the middle of the road?

Not that kind of lost.

but I've never said it out loud.

I mean, what's the point?
It's not gonna change anything.

It's not gonna make me good.
Make me adopt a puppy.
