00:10.329 --> 00:12.420
Ah! Check it out.

00:12.749 --> 00:14.950
Double-breasted... timeless.

00:15.050 --> 00:17.151
You'll never get away with this.

00:17.253 --> 00:20.255
A fitted suit on a pear shape?
You're insane.

00:20.356 --> 00:22.690
What did I tell you about speaking?

00:22.791 --> 00:25.760
I guess somebody doesn't want
their dinner pellets tonight!

00:37.273 --> 00:38.973
Damn it.

00:48.784 --> 00:49.851
Just don't talk.

00:49.952 --> 00:51.286
Got it.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.326
Can I help you, Officer?

00:58.427 --> 01:02.263
Are you Calvin Sniglet
of 3412 Vicious Circle?

01:02.364 --> 01:04.032
Yeah.

01:04.974 --> 01:06.876
We've been looking for you.

01:07.593 --> 01:08.578
Is that right?

01:10.088 --> 01:12.307
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

01:18.714 --> 01:19.914
There's been three break-ins

01:20.015 --> 01:21.382
in this neighborhood in the last month.

01:21.483 --> 01:23.217
We're doing our best
to keep the neighborhood safe,

01:23.319 --> 01:24.585
but keep your doors locked,

01:24.687 --> 01:27.136
and if you see something, say something.

01:28.324 --> 01:31.059
Sir, you mind opening the door
so I can slip you my card?

01:36.398 --> 01:37.635
What is that?

01:41.236 --> 01:44.205
You think I wouldn't notice this?

01:45.301 --> 01:48.277
You've got a low-battery light
on your smoke detector.

01:51.316 --> 01:52.814
Oh, yeah.

01:52.915 --> 01:54.482
I've been meaning to change that.

01:54.583 --> 01:55.950
I'll take care of it.

01:56.051 --> 01:59.087
You know, undetected flames

01:59.188 --> 02:01.589
is the number-one cause
of fire in the home.

02:01.854 --> 02:03.321
Okay. There you go.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.426
- Well, thank you, Officer.
- My pleasure.

02:05.527 --> 02:09.130
Oh, and, uh, you need to change
your wife's newspaper.

02:21.076 --> 02:23.411
You're gonna be locked
up for a long time.

02:23.512 --> 02:24.435
I'm talking life.

02:24.661 --> 02:26.595
No parole, no appeals.

02:26.915 --> 02:29.884
And then she says her vows
and... boom... we're hitched.

02:29.985 --> 02:31.419
It's gonna be beautiful, sir.

02:31.458 --> 02:33.259
So where are we on Scholls?
Has anyone found her?

02:33.422 --> 02:36.024
Not yet, sir, but this should
really speed things up.

02:36.026 --> 02:38.160
Oh, wow. That's great. Great picture.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.461
There's a theory that
Calvin Sniglet took her

02:40.562 --> 02:42.130
to get back at us for ruining his plan

02:42.231 --> 02:44.328
- to destroy humanity.
- It's not a theory.

02:44.329 --> 02:46.701
- He definitely has her.
- Listen to me.

02:46.802 --> 02:49.070
I want every resource we
have devoted to this.

02:49.124 --> 02:51.527
I also want every resource we have

02:51.577 --> 02:53.478
devoted to this other murder...

02:53.876 --> 02:58.312
30-year-old female Susan Learner
found dead in massage parlor.

02:58.314 --> 03:00.682
Somebody rubbed her out,
and you're gonna find out who.

03:00.883 --> 03:02.116
Geils, this will represent

03:02.217 --> 03:04.288
the final stage of your
lieutenant training.

03:04.304 --> 03:05.386
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

03:05.487 --> 03:07.021
You're in charge while I
take a leave of absence

03:07.122 --> 03:08.790
for my wedding and my honeymoon.

03:08.891 --> 03:10.525
But the second you hear anything...

03:10.527 --> 03:12.928
anything at all about
Scholls, contact me.

03:13.081 --> 03:14.315
- How do we get...
- I'm unreachable.

03:14.463 --> 03:17.532
- Oh, sir, your heart medicat...
- Tell it to Geils!

03:20.335 --> 03:21.969
We're ready for you.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.704
Okay, great.

03:23.806 --> 03:26.374
Are we supposed
to leave our underwear on?

03:26.483 --> 03:27.817
Yes.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.039
Oh, cool, cool.

03:31.580 --> 03:33.981
What are we looking at, Scholls.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.583
Oh, right.

03:35.684 --> 03:36.951
I think we got to get used to the fact

03:37.052 --> 03:39.118
that she might not be around anymore.

03:39.777 --> 03:41.445
Any witnesses, Scholls?

03:41.757 --> 03:43.324
I'm a witness.

03:43.425 --> 03:45.593
I found Miss Learner dead on the table.

03:45.694 --> 03:47.528
I'm Detective Tribeca.
This is Detective Tanner.

03:47.629 --> 03:49.197
Can we ask you a couple of questions?

03:49.199 --> 03:50.783
Sure. Room number four.

03:50.799 --> 03:52.366
Take off the robe,
get under the blanket,

03:52.468 --> 03:53.534
and I'll be in in a minute.

03:53.635 --> 03:55.837
Did you bring any extra underwear?

03:56.754 --> 03:59.774
Susan's been a regular client
for a couple years.

03:59.875 --> 04:02.710
I came in for her appointment
and found her like that.

04:02.811 --> 04:04.212
Did anyone hear anything?

04:04.313 --> 04:05.512
Oh, I heard her screaming,

04:05.513 --> 04:07.715
but I thought it was coming
from Marco's room,

04:07.816 --> 04:10.952
'cause his hot stones can be pretty hot.

04:11.053 --> 04:13.508
Ooh. You got a lot of knots.

04:14.125 --> 04:15.859
I have a lot going on right now.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.462
Could you give us the names of
all the masseuses working today?

04:21.563 --> 04:24.465
Sure can. I can get them
from the front desk.

04:24.566 --> 04:27.201
Scholls would've had them names already.

04:27.396 --> 04:28.262
I know.

04:28.991 --> 04:30.304
Anybody want a happy ending?

04:30.405 --> 04:32.483
- Yes, please.
- Absolutely.

04:33.375 --> 04:34.678
That'll do, pig.

04:38.981 --> 04:40.281
That'll do.

04:49.596 --> 04:50.763
Anything yet?

04:50.864 --> 04:52.264
I'm about to slice it open.

04:53.448 --> 04:54.453
Here it goes.

04:59.473 --> 05:02.041
Whoa. Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

05:02.142 --> 05:03.709
I see it, but I don't believe it.

05:05.278 --> 05:08.116
This should do it. One final cut.

05:09.416 --> 05:11.717
- Whoa.
- Whoa, it's amazing.

05:11.818 --> 05:13.219
My God.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.353
Look at the layers.

05:14.454 --> 05:16.756
Pepperoni, cheese, sauce.

05:16.857 --> 05:18.257
And what's that on the crust?

05:19.226 --> 05:20.760
Caramelized cheese.

05:20.861 --> 05:23.028
Little Caesars is getting busy.

05:25.899 --> 05:29.735
Mmm. That's Little Caesars
Deep! Deep! Dish pizza.

05:29.736 --> 05:31.426
_

05:31.427 --> 05:33.739
Is this the forensics lab?

05:33.742 --> 05:35.708
Mom? What are you doing here?

05:35.809 --> 05:39.345
Oh, the temp agency sent me to
be the new forensics specialist.

05:39.446 --> 05:42.609
Mrs. Tribeca, great to see you.

05:42.672 --> 05:43.949
Here's the body right over here.

05:44.784 --> 05:46.218
Why did you dump him again?

05:46.319 --> 05:47.286
Mom, stop it!

05:48.314 --> 05:50.523
Oh, mm. This is serious.

05:50.624 --> 05:52.091
You don't know anything about forensics.

05:52.192 --> 05:53.292
Why did they send you here?

05:53.393 --> 05:54.693
Because I told them I could type

05:54.795 --> 05:56.929
and that I have a doctorate
in forensic science.

05:57.030 --> 05:59.064
- You know how to type?
- No.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.866
Without Scholls, this is hopeless.

06:00.967 --> 06:04.010
These lacerations are consistent
with an animal attack.

06:04.011 --> 06:05.880
Look at the spaces between the claws.

06:05.951 --> 06:08.207
This woman was killed by a Bengal tiger.

06:08.308 --> 06:10.732
Whoa. How did you even...

06:10.756 --> 06:13.212
Neil Young had a fascination
with big cats...

06:13.313 --> 06:14.580
and my derriere.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.615
Mom!

06:15.816 --> 06:18.884
How did a tiger get into
a massage parlor?

06:19.398 --> 06:21.096
By dressing in human clothes.

06:22.498 --> 06:23.255
Sniglet.

06:24.758 --> 06:27.128
If we find Sniglet, we can find Scholls.

06:27.727 --> 06:28.736
Found him.

06:30.831 --> 06:31.997
Good afternoon.

06:32.098 --> 06:33.933
Calvin Sniglet, you're under arrest.

06:34.034 --> 06:35.006
Not so fast.

06:36.247 --> 06:38.137
Stand back. He's got a bedbug.

06:42.576 --> 06:45.177
Jesus, you train for this,
but nothing can prepare you.

06:45.278 --> 06:47.279
Lay one hand on me, and I set him loose.

06:47.380 --> 06:50.216
Have fun washing
and re-washing your clothes...

06:50.317 --> 06:52.518
putting everything you own into bags,

06:52.619 --> 06:54.653
constantly scratching tiny bug bites.

06:54.754 --> 06:57.389
And worst of all, purchasing
a brand-new mattress.

06:57.490 --> 06:58.824
I just got used to mine.

06:58.925 --> 07:01.198
And we're miles away
from Labor Day sales.

07:16.663 --> 07:17.750
What do you want, Sniglet?

07:17.751 --> 07:18.647
Not much.

07:19.303 --> 07:21.941
Just for you to close the L.A. Zoo
and set all the animals free.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.603
No way. Never gonna happen.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.238
Then the animal attacks will continue.

07:25.339 --> 07:27.974
And you'll be seeing Dr. Scholls
back in the forensics lab.

07:28.075 --> 07:29.741
- Well, that's good.
- As a corpse.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.233
I walked right into that.

07:31.234 --> 07:33.269
Set all the zoo animals free,

07:34.136 --> 07:36.337
and you can have your human back.

07:45.074 --> 07:45.802
Uh-oh.

07:47.576 --> 07:48.902
Siri, get me the mayor.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.378
- Calling Mayor Joe Perry.
- Siri, hang up.

07:51.432 --> 07:53.199
You can't close the zoo.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.124
It'll be chaos, and we can't
have chaos this weekend...

07:56.125 --> 07:57.275
it's Cat-astrophic!

07:57.276 --> 07:59.407
We all enjoy the nation's
largest cat festival,

07:59.408 --> 08:01.587
but I have to think about
the safety of our citizens.

08:01.588 --> 08:03.205
If the Lieutenant were here right now,

08:03.206 --> 08:04.268
you know what he'd say.

08:04.269 --> 08:05.767
Geils, don't be foolish.

08:05.768 --> 08:07.060
That's a good Atkins.

08:07.162 --> 08:08.283
I couldn't stay away.

08:08.659 --> 08:11.784
These are my future in-laws,
Frank and Tanya.

08:11.885 --> 08:13.686
Can, uh, you point me to the bathroom?

08:13.787 --> 08:16.152
Down the hall, and make it quick!

08:16.153 --> 08:19.225
These animal attacks will continue
unless we listen to Sniglet's demands,

08:19.326 --> 08:21.347
not to mention Scholls.
We have no choice.

08:21.348 --> 08:22.890
Sniglet is a madman.

08:22.905 --> 08:24.809
If we give in to him now,
who knows what he'll do next.

08:24.810 --> 08:25.549
Damn it, Geils,

08:25.550 --> 08:28.700
90% of the city's revenue
comes from zoo tickets.

08:28.701 --> 08:30.849
Detroit has cars. Wisconsin has cheese.

08:30.912 --> 08:33.452
L.A. has fat people roaming around

08:33.453 --> 08:34.919
looking at animals in cages.

08:35.013 --> 08:36.236
Phew! That's better.

08:36.236 --> 08:37.749
Welcome back, Mrs. Weidner.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.434
Now, if potty time is over,

08:39.570 --> 08:42.005
we have a rehearsal dinner to get to.

08:48.455 --> 08:49.258
It's your call.

08:51.069 --> 08:52.783
All my life, I've wanted to be
the kind of lieutenant

08:52.784 --> 08:54.692
who prevents people from getting killed.

08:56.237 --> 08:58.421
Get me the mayor. I'm closing the zoo.

09:00.068 --> 09:01.555
Oh, wow. That's so wrong.

09:08.655 --> 09:10.480
_

09:10.481 --> 09:12.481
_

09:12.482 --> 09:14.482
_

09:14.483 --> 09:16.483
_

09:17.500 --> 09:19.500
_

09:20.134 --> 09:22.134
_

09:23.626 --> 09:26.261
I know what you're gonna say.
Closing the zoo was a mistake.

09:26.362 --> 09:28.913
People are still getting
killed, Sniglet lied,

09:29.664 --> 09:31.500
and Scholls is no closer to being found.

09:31.601 --> 09:33.435
Your career is doomed, Geils.

09:33.536 --> 09:35.170
Good doomed or bad doomed?

09:35.271 --> 09:38.507
And as far as Dr. Scholls...

09:38.608 --> 09:40.642
Monica, you're alive.
How did you escape?

09:40.743 --> 09:43.140
I used my bun to pick
the lock on the cage.

09:43.263 --> 09:45.692
After that, it was a simple
matter of seducing an armadillo

09:45.693 --> 09:47.183
and then walking out the front door.

09:47.184 --> 09:50.140
After which, Monica and I
had quite a nice talk.

09:50.471 --> 09:52.463
- Didn't we, Monica?
- It was okay.

09:52.620 --> 09:54.254
Geils, I was quite intrigued to learn

09:54.355 --> 09:56.923
that you were not only having
an inappropriate relationship

09:57.024 --> 09:59.025
with the head of forensics,
but that, subsequently,

09:59.126 --> 10:00.861
you were having
an inappropriate relationship

10:00.962 --> 10:02.262
with another detective.

10:02.363 --> 10:03.864
Why are you doing this?

10:03.965 --> 10:06.733
I could talk about things
like ethics and civil service,

10:06.834 --> 10:08.568
transparency in law enforcement,

10:08.669 --> 10:11.471
but the simple truth is you traded hos,

10:11.572 --> 10:12.906
now we tradin' blows.

10:13.007 --> 10:15.909
Acting Lieutenant Geils,
you are hereby suspended.

10:16.010 --> 10:18.011
Mr. Mayor, please. We can fix this.

10:18.112 --> 10:19.312
It's not Geils' fault.

10:19.413 --> 10:21.414
Are you speaking as a cop
or an ex-lover?

10:21.515 --> 10:22.716
Ex-lover.

10:22.817 --> 10:25.671
In accordance with the
line of succession,

10:25.671 --> 10:27.721
Detective Hoffman is acting lieutenant.

10:30.758 --> 10:33.360
Geils, don't worry.
We're gonna figure this out.

10:33.461 --> 10:34.561
You were right, Angie.

10:34.662 --> 10:36.997
It was a mistake for me to even try.

10:39.964 --> 10:43.246
You suspended a good cop.
Maybe the best.

10:44.772 --> 10:47.111
I told you about the secret bathroom.

11:00.321 --> 11:02.422
Well, well, well.

11:02.523 --> 11:04.130
Angela Tribeca.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.027
Dr. Hornbein, I need your help.

11:07.128 --> 11:08.698
Please, sit down.

11:10.959 --> 11:14.100
Calvin Sniglet has somehow
trained the zoo animals

11:14.201 --> 11:15.702
- to attack humans.
- Mm.

11:15.803 --> 11:17.437
So the hunted are becoming the hunters,

11:17.538 --> 11:19.639
the consumed are becoming the consumers.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.742
The downtrodden are becoming
the up-not-trodden.

11:22.843 --> 11:24.411
I don't know how to stop him.

11:24.512 --> 11:26.877
Personal things, please.

11:28.595 --> 11:29.950
Fine.

11:30.051 --> 11:32.419
I found out my father was alive.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.188
He faked his own death when I was 12.

11:35.289 --> 11:38.099
I went to see him,
and he ran away again.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.280
Yes, yes, I know that.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.828
What I want you to tell me
is how did that make you feel.

11:41.929 --> 11:44.164
- Angry.
- That's a secondary emotion.

11:44.263 --> 11:48.278
- How did it make you feel?
- Sad. Alone.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.437
Those are all secondary emotions.

11:50.538 --> 11:53.273
Tell me how did it make you feel?!

11:54.106 --> 11:55.241
Hurt.

11:55.343 --> 11:56.805
Hurt, yes.

11:57.812 --> 11:59.392
It's easy to hurt children.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.643
They have no control over
what happens to them...

12:01.869 --> 12:03.670
neither do animals, actually.

12:03.818 --> 12:06.820
Mr. Sniglet is both
an animal and a child.

12:06.921 --> 12:09.089
Now he's fighting for control.

12:09.190 --> 12:10.323
How do we stop him?

12:10.424 --> 12:11.594
Oh, I'll help you.

12:13.527 --> 12:15.311
Under one condition.

12:16.097 --> 12:19.799
And now by the power vested in
me from the State of California,

12:19.900 --> 12:22.969
the City of Los Angeles,
and audible.com,

12:23.070 --> 12:25.597
I now pronounced you
Lieutenant and wife.

12:26.173 --> 12:27.612
You may kiss the bride.

12:40.817 --> 12:42.484
Here ya go... total failure.

12:42.585 --> 12:45.936
Hey, he's just a guy who was
trying to do the right thing

12:45.937 --> 12:47.522
and it resulted in seven people dying.

12:47.623 --> 12:49.157
Total failure is the name of the drink.

12:49.258 --> 12:52.494
It's two shots of Four Loko
and a can of New Coke.

12:55.899 --> 12:57.399
I'm worried about you, Geils.

12:57.630 --> 13:00.502
Why don't you just go hang out
with your serial killer date?

13:02.872 --> 13:04.206
It's the only way I could get him

13:04.307 --> 13:06.274
to agree to help me find Sniglet.

13:06.375 --> 13:08.810
Lieutenant Hoffman signed off on it.

13:09.513 --> 13:10.280
Sorry.

13:11.241 --> 13:11.980
You'll make lieutenant soon.

13:12.081 --> 13:15.183
Honestly, I haven't given
it a second thought.

13:15.284 --> 13:17.919
Thanks for letting me read
the first draft of your book.

13:18.020 --> 13:20.255
I love the end when he makes lieutenant.

13:23.499 --> 13:25.339
I'm not great at emotional pep talks

13:25.339 --> 13:28.064
that inspire people to action, but...

13:28.164 --> 13:30.298
for you, I'm gonna give it a shot.

13:31.901 --> 13:34.302
Ow!

13:34.749 --> 13:35.882
Quit feeling sorry for yourself

13:35.883 --> 13:37.785
and step up to the plate, you big pussy.

13:37.886 --> 13:39.315
People need you.

13:39.868 --> 13:42.223
And if you're gonna focus
on what you've lost

13:42.324 --> 13:44.588
and not on what you have,
then you're really stupid.

13:44.589 --> 13:45.926
I'm talking to myself, too.

13:46.027 --> 13:48.062
My dad left me. Who cares?!

13:48.163 --> 13:50.898
I raised myself, and I
became a great cop.

13:50.999 --> 13:52.660
I was basically my own dad.

13:53.051 --> 13:55.539
So what if no one ever
told me how sex works.

13:55.540 --> 13:56.812
That explains a lot.

13:56.813 --> 13:58.206
When bad stuff happens,

13:58.597 --> 14:00.703
the dad in us picks up
the little kid in us,

14:00.971 --> 14:02.838
and we get the job done.

14:03.245 --> 14:04.129
So?

14:04.980 --> 14:06.443
Ready to go to work...

14:07.582 --> 14:08.494
son?

14:09.618 --> 14:12.193
Yeah.

14:12.608 --> 14:14.755
If I could have everyone's
attention, please.

14:14.856 --> 14:17.258
I'd like to say a few words
about my mentor,

14:17.359 --> 14:19.827
the man who's taught me
right from wrong,

14:19.928 --> 14:21.295
courage under fire,

14:21.396 --> 14:25.199
the difference between "there,"
"they're," and "their,"

14:25.300 --> 14:30.104
and how to take care of the
weakest among us, the animals.

14:31.010 --> 14:33.307
I'm talking, of course,
about Calvin Sniglet.

14:34.509 --> 14:37.111
Hello, everyone!

14:37.212 --> 14:39.113
Oh, my God. She's with him.

14:39.214 --> 14:41.248
It's gonna be so much fun shooting her.

14:41.349 --> 14:44.051
Welcome, everyone, to the last...

14:44.152 --> 14:46.520
To the last...

14:46.527 --> 14:47.940
Hello.

14:48.108 --> 14:49.441
Come on. Seriously?

14:49.824 --> 14:51.408
Check, two, check.

14:51.485 --> 14:52.403
Hello.

14:53.182 --> 14:55.429
Ah. Come on. Hello.

14:55.530 --> 14:57.698
Can you hear me, anybody? Can I, uh...

14:58.423 --> 14:58.933
Check it... check it, two.

14:59.034 --> 15:00.434
Check, give me... check two.

15:01.514 --> 15:03.010
Hello. Check. Come on.

15:03.805 --> 15:05.205
One, two. One...

15:05.307 --> 15:07.308
Can I get another microphone,
please? Do you see?

15:07.409 --> 15:09.743
Yeah, just give me
a new microphone. This is...

15:09.844 --> 15:11.578
How about now?
How about... Can you hear me?

15:11.580 --> 15:13.747
Check? Yeah, there we go! Okay.

15:13.949 --> 15:16.016
Much better, all right.
We're good now, folks.

15:16.117 --> 15:17.405
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:17.656 --> 15:20.938
welcome to your last day on Earth.

15:20.993 --> 15:24.917
Humans are the most destructive
force this planet has ever seen,

15:25.026 --> 15:27.261
and it ends today.

15:27.362 --> 15:28.195
Calvin.

15:28.296 --> 15:30.230
Oh, hey, Angie. Good to see you.

15:30.332 --> 15:31.799
Turn yourself in.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.068
We know your heart's in the right place.

15:34.169 --> 15:36.924
The way that we treat animals
is absolutely insane.

15:37.339 --> 15:40.020
But killing all the humans
isn't the answer.

15:40.462 --> 15:43.010
Go volunteer. Be an activist.

15:43.111 --> 15:44.845
Heck, run for mayor. You got my vote.

15:45.735 --> 15:47.080
Ah, it doesn't matter anyway.

15:47.624 --> 15:49.341
Humans had their time on Earth.

15:49.787 --> 15:52.722
And like all species,
they eventually go extinct.

15:53.121 --> 15:55.208
I'm just here to speed up the process.

15:55.651 --> 15:56.930
You can't win.

15:57.398 --> 15:58.822
There's too many of us.

15:58.823 --> 15:59.757
You're right.

16:00.862 --> 16:02.096
I'm all alone.

16:02.865 --> 16:04.331
Or am I?

16:06.524 --> 16:08.428
Say hello to my little friend.

16:13.367 --> 16:15.776
Devour them!

16:15.877 --> 16:17.177
Damn. I thought it was a Jet Ski.

16:17.278 --> 16:20.658
Angie. Angie, let me loose.

16:20.659 --> 16:22.649
I'm a trained zoo keeper.

16:30.859 --> 16:33.861
Hello, my majestic jungle...

16:37.499 --> 16:40.300
If I never pee in another
Porta-Potty again,

16:40.302 --> 16:43.133
it will be too s...

16:55.617 --> 16:58.085
Yes!

16:58.186 --> 17:01.889
Yes! Hunt them down
just as they would do to you!

17:01.990 --> 17:03.323
Togeth... Aah!

17:06.895 --> 17:08.896
It's pretty bad out there.

17:08.997 --> 17:10.897
We might not make it out alive.

17:10.999 --> 17:12.223
I just want to say

17:12.224 --> 17:14.401
I always planned on getting
back together with you

17:14.502 --> 17:15.536
when I ran out of options.

17:15.637 --> 17:18.739
That means a lot to me,
but we're gonna be okay.

17:18.839 --> 17:22.342
Sniglet's dead, and I'm sure
the tiger's getting full.

17:22.444 --> 17:23.944
We just need a weapon.

17:24.045 --> 17:26.413
Angie, hand me the...

17:26.513 --> 17:28.147
Angie?

17:28.249 --> 17:31.685
Hey, Stripes, pick on
someone your own size!

17:35.085 --> 17:36.290
Oh, shit.

17:37.357 --> 17:38.517
Tribeca!

17:46.000 --> 17:48.936
Bad kitty.

17:49.679 --> 17:51.638
You have the right to remain endangered.

17:53.171 --> 17:53.958
Geils.

17:56.298 --> 17:57.154
Geils?

17:58.279 --> 17:59.017
Geils.

18:00.048 --> 18:01.258
I'm not gonna make it.

18:01.492 --> 18:03.750
No, no, yes, you are. Yes, you are.

18:03.852 --> 18:05.799
No, I'm not.

18:07.055 --> 18:09.123
Then you should know that I love you

18:09.224 --> 18:12.037
more than I've ever loved
anybody or anything.

18:13.128 --> 18:18.822
More than my parents,
siblings, chocolate, money.

18:20.268 --> 18:21.935
You'll always be my partner.

18:23.649 --> 18:26.440
And now I'll always be alone.

18:30.802 --> 18:33.447
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

18:33.548 --> 18:34.515
What... What was that?

18:35.374 --> 18:36.222
I... I said...

18:37.318 --> 18:39.486
"Congratulations, Lieutenant."

18:55.837 --> 18:57.638
Good work, Detective Geils.

18:58.940 --> 19:00.538
Or should I say...

19:01.242 --> 19:03.310
Lieutenant Geils.

19:07.582 --> 19:08.582
You mean this was all...

19:08.683 --> 19:10.083
Your final exam.

19:10.185 --> 19:12.553
You passed with flying colors.

19:12.654 --> 19:14.533
But what about Sniglet
and the zoo keeper?

19:14.534 --> 19:16.657
Say hello to Todd Bender from Vice.

19:18.193 --> 19:21.128
And Chris Harbinson
from the daycare center.

19:21.229 --> 19:22.629
Special kudos to Harbinson.

19:22.730 --> 19:25.478
He had to spend 15 years
in prison to prepare for this.

19:25.479 --> 19:29.136
So fun.

19:29.237 --> 19:31.371
- But you got married, right?
- Yeah, right.

19:31.711 --> 19:33.446
Say hello to my niece, Natasha.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.482
- Good to see you, Uncle Pritikin.
- You too, honey.

19:36.583 --> 19:37.783
But the... But the tiger.

19:37.884 --> 19:39.718
Congratulations.

19:39.820 --> 19:42.503
But if it means anything,
I was into the handcuffs.

19:43.276 --> 19:45.925
We went to different
cities tracking Sniglet.

19:46.026 --> 19:47.104
He killed people.

19:47.105 --> 19:50.617
All death row inmates that
were gonna get executed anyway.

19:50.912 --> 19:52.216
What?!

19:53.275 --> 19:55.434
There were times when
people worked the case

19:55.436 --> 19:56.417
that I wasn't there.

19:56.418 --> 19:59.578
Geils, you're over-thinking
it, as usual.

20:00.864 --> 20:02.329
But you know what is real?

20:02.847 --> 20:04.014
This party.

20:04.444 --> 20:06.579
So let's get to it!

20:26.465 --> 20:28.552
What a party, huh?

20:28.653 --> 20:30.843
Mmm! And we have the taxpayers to thank.

20:33.618 --> 20:36.573
They're probably gonna
put you in a big office.

20:37.207 --> 20:38.541
I'm gonna miss having you near me.

20:38.963 --> 20:40.364
Oh, that reminds me.

20:40.465 --> 20:42.332
I did such a good job
with the Geils training,

20:42.433 --> 20:44.534
I... I got promoted to captain.

20:44.636 --> 20:47.104
I get to keep my office,
you stay at your desk,

20:47.205 --> 20:49.339
and everything stays exactly the same.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.641
Oh.

20:50.649 --> 20:53.484
You're under arrest for
the murder of Angie Tribeca.

20:55.146 --> 20:56.036
Murder?

20:56.914 --> 20:58.382
But that is her.

20:58.483 --> 21:01.018
We just received some disturbing news.

21:01.119 --> 21:03.120
This is not Angie Tribeca.
