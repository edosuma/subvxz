00:35.452 --> 00:36.658
[contented sigh]

00:40.040 --> 00:42.372
WOMAN: Yes, Kirk.
We sent them 2 samples.

00:47.631 --> 00:50.373
Good day, nurse. We have the therapy
for my patient downstairs?

00:52.553 --> 00:54.385
[telephone rings]

00:54.930 --> 00:56.011
Ah, thank you.

01:02.020 --> 01:05.138
P.A.: Dr. Berkholter,
code blue in OR 2-5-2.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.788
Dr. Berkholter,
code blue in OR 2-5-2.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.241
That's a code blue in OR 2-5-2.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.846
Dr. Berkholter,
where the hell are you?

02:03.790 --> 02:04.825
[ding]

02:38.492 --> 02:39.323
How's it going, Burt?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.617
Ah, you should be thankful
for small favors.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.949
Look at this.
Now, I would kill to be in the field.

02:50.295 --> 02:54.254
Burt...you have
the soul of a poet.

02:55.717 --> 02:56.957
[buzzer]

02:59.680 --> 03:00.795
Won't be a minute.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.770
Wake up, Mr. Oliver.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.027
Come on, Mr. Oliver.
It's dinnertime.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.525
You don't wanna miss
your last meal, do you?

03:22.786 --> 03:23.901
MAN: The Joint Chiefs of Staff

03:26.832 --> 03:29.449
The remaining C.H.U.D.
is being terminated as we speak.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.451
Sorry, Ted. Meeting adjourned.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.542
Ah, I'm not into chemical war.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.254
Thank God.

03:41.888 --> 03:42.923
I'm disappointed in you, doctor.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.718
Had the C.H.U.D. research continued,

03:46.727 --> 03:50.766
we could have had the ultimate
in biochemical warfare,

03:52.107 --> 03:54.599
an enzyme that would allow
soldiers to go on fighting

03:55.360 --> 03:57.397
even after they were
clinically dead.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.608
I'm afraid I don't share
your enthusiasm, Colonel.

04:01.992 --> 04:05.735
The C.H.U.D. enzyme stimulated
the brain to a point of frenzy.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.863
They showed a lot of spunk.
That's all.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.787
Colonel Masters,
there was a reason

04:16.130 --> 04:18.668
For instance,
the little matter of the drug's...

04:19.176 --> 04:21.338
cannibalistic side effects.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.720
A small glitch.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.430
What the hell?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.273
[static buzzing]

04:38.445 --> 04:41.358
[growling]

04:47.162 --> 04:47.993
What?!

04:48.622 --> 04:49.737
You sure?

04:51.541 --> 04:52.622
All right, we're on our way.

04:52.876 --> 04:53.741
What's the problem?

04:54.419 --> 04:55.250
The C.H.U.D.'s escaped.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.795
Just remember,
we don't want to damage him.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.631
Just freeze him till we can get him
into the cryogenic chamber.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.470
All right, men. Move out.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.142
[weapon charging]

05:23.448 --> 05:24.438
[whispering] And ready?

05:26.409 --> 05:27.820
[vowl] Aah!

05:28.745 --> 05:29.655
[cat yowling]

05:29.871 --> 05:30.781
A--A cat.

05:31.873 --> 05:32.704
Raah!

05:34.125 --> 05:41.088
Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him!

05:48.098 --> 05:49.133
All right,
that's enough, gentlemen.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.181
We've got him.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.261
We've got him, haven't we?

05:55.564 --> 05:58.056
Yes, sir.
That's one frozen stiff.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.307
Ahem.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.852
[whistling a tune]
What about that--that thing?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.229
No, no, no. He's not my problem now.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.527
If and when the project gets re-funded,

06:08.159 --> 06:10.696
<i>I'll</i> defrost him and give him
a jolt of electricity

06:11.204 --> 06:12.945
that'll shock the synapses
in the old noggin,

06:13.248 --> 06:15.535
and those enzymes
will get our buddy perking again.

06:19.337 --> 06:22.671
Now, in the meantime, we have to get
our sleeping beauty back there in limbo

06:23.133 --> 06:25.966
to the Winterhaven Center
for Disease Control.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.252
I never heard of the place.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.798
COL. MASTERS: Government-funded research
center in some podunk town.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.716
[thunder]

06:37.731 --> 06:41.770
MR. PROCTOR: And tomorrow, class,
I have a treat in store for you.

06:42.360 --> 06:46.399
We actually get to look at a cadaver
from Lee's Funeral Home.

06:46.823 --> 06:47.654
- Yecch!
- Come on!

06:47.866 --> 06:49.857
A dead body is nothing to be afraid of.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.778
Well now. Let's see how we're doing
with our experiments.

06:54.164 --> 06:59.079
Mr. Williams, I'm sure you'd be delighted
to seize this opportunity

07:05.300 --> 07:06.165
[frog croaks]

07:07.677 --> 07:09.884
Mr. Proctor, fellow students.

07:10.847 --> 07:14.556
Direct your attention, if you would,
to the frog before me.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.686
Poor Benjy here is completely
without the use of his back legs.

07:20.649 --> 07:21.730
I hate it when he does this.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.859
Miss Norton, are you following
Mr. Williams' experiment?

07:26.488 --> 07:27.978
[Benjy croaks]
Uh, yes, sir.

07:28.823 --> 07:33.818
Here today I will demonstrate
the essential symbiology.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.411
- Symbiosis.
- Between...

07:37.499 --> 07:39.911
have you guessed it?
Uh, Katie.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.076
Between electricity and life?

07:42.629 --> 07:43.994
Exactly.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.671
- Whoa!

07:47.384 --> 07:48.215
Inoficed.

07:49.010 --> 07:49.875
- Don't do that.
- Don't--

07:51.054 --> 07:51.919
- Aah!
- Everybody out.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.262
Fire!

07:56.017 --> 07:57.428
Good thinking, Kev.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.096
KEVIN:
Well, I hope you're happy.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.023
I thought you loved school.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.359
This isn't school, Steve.
This is punishment.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.152
All school is punishment.

08:10.782 --> 08:11.692
Now I'm gonna get warts.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.865
So you wear a glove.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.245
I can't believe I let you
get me in these messes.

08:18.790 --> 08:19.746
What messes?

08:20.375 --> 08:21.536
You're a straight-A student.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.368
Besides, if it wasn't for me,
you'd never have any fun, man.

08:24.671 --> 08:25.661
You call this fun?

08:26.423 --> 08:28.084
Hey, at least he didn't suspend us.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.626
Sometimes I wish my life
were just a little more boring.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.176
Sure you do.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.966
You know, I think there's hope
for you yet, man.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.597
Between you and me,
we can really make it out there.

08:38.977 --> 08:39.842
Where?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.176
The world, Kev!

08:41.730 --> 08:44.392
Once we get out of this town,
there'll be no stopping us.

08:45.942 --> 08:46.773
One got away!

08:47.610 --> 08:49.977
Think about it.
With my energy and your brains...

08:50.196 --> 08:52.403
the world will cower at our feet.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.197
Will you cut it out?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.320
I can't see what I'm doing.
Cut it out.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.194
" Ow!
" You okay?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.290
Yeah, yeah. I just bumped into--

09:04.210 --> 09:05.166
Oh, shit.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.706
It's Mr. Proctor's dead guy.

09:07.047 --> 09:07.957
Stand back, doctor.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.329
Code blue.
Code blue.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.464
- Oh...
- Shit.

09:18.016 --> 09:18.972
KEVIN:
What do we do now?

09:25.523 --> 09:26.354
Hey, watch it!

09:27.150 --> 09:29.141
KEVIN: Brake!
- I don't think he can hear you, man.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.653
Mr. Proctor's gonna know it was us.
He's gonna expel us.

09:34.074 --> 09:34.905
Or at least you.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.486
Come on!
Let's go!

09:45.710 --> 09:46.541
DRIVER: What the hell?

09:49.339 --> 09:50.170
Now what?

09:50.840 --> 09:53.002
Well, we--we got two choices here.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.632
I don't wanna hear this.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.551
We--We can just tell Mr. Proctor

10:00.934 --> 10:01.765
Or...

10:02.310 --> 10:03.550
we could find a replacement.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.067
[rock music playing
on car radio]

10:21.079 --> 10:22.786
- How's Mr. Oliver?
- Still dead, man.

10:26.501 --> 10:27.832
It's a disease control center.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.752
Have you no imagination?
Do you wanna flunk his class?

10:35.718 --> 10:36.549
Good point.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.466
Hey. What's that?

10:44.769 --> 10:47.181
Hello, beautiful.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.310
When you're dead,
you're skanky.

10:51.526 --> 10:52.357
It goes with the territory.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.068
Oh, yeah.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.938
All right. Let's just get him out
and get him dressed.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.443
Katie's waiting.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.573
Uh, since the bio lab's
gonna be locked,

11:03.913 --> 11:05.495
what do you say we leave him
at your house tonight, huh?

11:05.707 --> 11:07.289
No, and not at Katie's, either.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.992
You have to be the doctor.
You get the body.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.412
Right.
[gas escapes]

11:14.215 --> 11:15.580
KEVIN
God, this guy is beefy.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.083
KATIE: Oh great, the guy dripped
all over the back seat.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.429
KEVIN: Hold up your end.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.631
STEVE: I guess this is what they mean
by "dead weight."

11:25.143 --> 11:26.429
Ha. Right.

11:28.938 --> 11:29.769
KEVIN: Shh.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.184
[door closes]
Steven, is that you?

11:35.820 --> 11:36.776
Uh, yeah, Mom.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.647
I brought Kevin home to help me,
uh, study.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.487
Oh, Kevin. Come on in.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.443
You keep them busy.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.944
<i>I'll</i> take him to the basement.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.408
Honey, it's Kevin.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.460
Huh? Oh, hi, Kev.
How are you doin'?

11:55.173 --> 11:58.211
We are watching a wonderful program
on the Alaskan wilderness.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.338
- Yeah.
- You know what that is?

12:00.970 --> 12:02.085
- Snow.
- Right.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.049
How 'bout those guys?

12:04.307 --> 12:05.138
Penguins.

No. Those are seals.

Shh.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.062
Keep it down, will you?

12:13.441 --> 12:14.897
Look at that.
Know what that is?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.229
- No, sir.
- Salmon.

12:20.448 --> 12:24.362
Just wait, Jasper. Tomorrow I'm bringing a pretty little
pit bull home for you, you little maggot.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.031
He'll turn you into dog chow
in a minute, you little--ohh!

often race among themselves.

up to 20 miles per hour...

Don't get up. Uh, <i>I'll</i> let him out.

- Uh, thanks, Kevin.

Who's that?

He is too.

[gasps]
You're having a nightmare.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.119
You are too.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.579
You're still in bed,
and you're having a nightmare.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.074
The worst kind.
The kind that can become real.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.667
And if you don't forget it
and get back into your room,

13:17.171 --> 13:19.208
this boogeyman,
who's really not here,

13:19.590 --> 13:21.672
will come alive
and kill you in your sleep.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.718
God, I'm gonna hate myself for that
when I'm an adult.

- Where is he?
- He's in there.

13:52.999 --> 13:53.830
- Oh, great!
- Shh.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.365
Keep your voice down, man.

13:56.127 --> 13:56.958
What are we gonna do?

13:57.295 --> 14:00.208
I don't know. I don't know.
Let me think.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.666
Okay, we could keep him
in my room overnight.

14:03.926 --> 14:04.757
Now the trick is getting him out...

14:05.720 --> 14:07.336
Steven, are you through?

14:08.181 --> 14:09.012
Yeah, Mom.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.386
Well, I wanted to take my bath
before dinner, dear.

14:13.936 --> 14:14.846
Okay. <i>I'll</i> be out in a minute.

MR. WILLIAMS:
Come quick, honey.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.773
All right, first we gotta drain that tub.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.439
I don't want my mother sitting
in some dead guy's bubble bath.

Hey, it's a start.

Raah! Err!

14:56.562 --> 14:59.145
Do you realize
what we have done here?

14:59.607 --> 15:00.722
I don't wanna think about it.

15:02.193 --> 15:05.060
We have discovered
the secret of life, pal.

15:05.780 --> 15:06.941
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

15:08.783 --> 15:12.367
It's gotta have something to do with
the ingredients of this bubble bath

15:12.954 --> 15:14.069
and the electrical current.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.164
Kevin, if we could analyze this...

15:20.628 --> 15:21.459
Kevin...

15:22.713 --> 15:24.203
we could get an A in biology.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.375
What are you talking about?

15:26.008 --> 15:30.127
Steve, you have a live dead guy
lying in your bathroom.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.379
[grunting]

15:38.521 --> 15:40.353
Sitting in your bathroom.

15:42.150 --> 15:42.981
[bone cracks]
Err!

15:43.359 --> 15:44.394
[winces]

15:46.904 --> 15:50.113
Now, listen, we'll take our Mr. Stiff
down the back way, okay?

15:50.491 --> 15:51.481
We'll get him in the basement.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.780
- Are you serious?
- Of course I am.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.949
Listen, man. Listen to me.

15:57.707 --> 15:58.947
Go check to see if the coast is clear.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.250
Come on, Kevin!

16:02.587 --> 16:03.918
Life is an adventure, right?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.247
Go, baby. Go.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.630
Am I having a nightmare, Kevin?

16:12.388 --> 16:13.219
We both are.

16:15.766 --> 16:16.597
[shudders]

16:16.809 --> 16:18.470
MR. WILLIAMS: That Eskimo
looks like he's wearing a--

16:19.395 --> 16:21.306
Ah ha ha!
I thought he was wearing a tuxedo.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.229
It's a penguin.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.943
[Bud grunting]

are off to a running start...

16:49.175 --> 16:51.587
TV: At times, they mistake
other species for their mates,

16:52.428 --> 16:57.764
including polar bears, walruses and other
warm-blooded mammals...

16:58.851 --> 17:00.558
especially during those long...

17:03.397 --> 17:05.387
Uh, yeah, Mom, but don't come up.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.224
Who has a poodle nowadays,
anyway?

17:10.613 --> 17:11.773
Would Kevin like to stay?

17:12.281 --> 17:13.988
Come on, man.
We gotta give Katie the good news.

17:14.282 --> 17:15.193
What about our stiff?

17:15.576 --> 17:17.487
We'll only be gone 20 minutes.
What could happen?

17:20.665 --> 17:23.123
Uh, Mom, w-we're gonna
go have dinner with Katie.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.412
Well, don't stay out too late,
sweetheart.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.038
Did you clean that stuff up?

17:30.258 --> 17:31.089
Yeah, Dad.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.009
Uh, bye, Mrs. Williams.
Bye, Mr. Williams.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.594
- See you, Kevin.
- Goodnight, Kevin.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.348
MR. WILLIAMS:
I hate dogs.

17:40.685 --> 17:41.891
[barks]

17:43.145 --> 17:44.306
What's he sorry about?

17:44.564 --> 17:45.429
I don't know, sweetheart.

17:45.773 --> 17:46.604
It's not his poodle.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.695
I think we should alert the media.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.116
I mean, we could
win a Noble for this.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.326
It's No-bell.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.286
I knew that.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.698
I think we should come clean,

18:05.543 --> 18:07.033
tell Mr. Proctor we lost his body,

18:10.423 --> 18:13.085
Steve, something is not right.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.129
[growls]
[Whimpers]

18:18.764 --> 18:20.095
So what have we got?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.345
Well, we have a videotape
of the kids who stole the body.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.768
It's probably a prank of some sort.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.353
- You have license plates?
- Yeah.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.434
Then we should have no problem
tracking them down...

18:31.027 --> 18:32.017
hopefully.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.317
What is the, uh,
worst-case scenario?

18:37.450 --> 18:38.906
Well, if the body's recovered--

18:41.621 --> 18:42.577
Not a Smurf story.

18:44.624 --> 18:48.162
The body is somehow reanimated
and turns on its captors.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.416
Jasper, puppy, puppy, puppy,
num-num.

because of academic probation

Ah.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.151
Now, this Kevin, you know,

20:39.947 --> 20:43.156
he's a little bit of a wimp
with his hands, but he thinks things through.

20:45.828 --> 20:49.822
Well, maybe Steven doesn't
wanna go into construction.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.911
It's a family tradition.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.580
I brought that kid into this world.
I can take him out of it.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.760
Oh, did you try the wine,
sweetheart?

21:48.432 --> 21:50.014
It's an award-winning wine
from Wisconsin.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.391
Delicious.

of special achievement award

22:57.877 --> 22:58.867
I don't think you should get involved.

22:59.795 --> 23:00.626
Why not?

23:02.214 --> 23:04.000
Because it could be dangerous,
and because--

23:05.968 --> 23:07.584
God, you guys really kill me.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.127
Let me see if I've got this right, Kev.

23:13.684 --> 23:14.845
Maybe just cheer you on?

Hang on.

You know, Kevin, you--you have
a definite way with women.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.854
I'm just trying
to keep her out of it.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.523
Why? We've been together
since we were kids.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.400
One for all, all for one, right?

23:33.787 --> 23:34.618
Pay that.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.872

It's ruining my mudpack!

24:14.495 --> 24:15.451
MR. WILLIAMS: Oh, God.

24:25.422 --> 24:28.710
My mother never used mudpacks
and beauty creams when I was a kid.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.168
Your mother looked like Humphrey Bogart.

Once the enzyme's
introduced into the brain--

The C.H.U.D.ified brain, however,
