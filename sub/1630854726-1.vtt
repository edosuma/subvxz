12:00.000 --> 12:01.791
For which you need accreditation.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.250
[laughs] Spot on, Hugh.

12:03.333 --> 12:04.708
-That's why you're here.
-Yes.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.666
Uh, one last thing.
This isn't about me making money.

12:07.750 --> 12:11.041
Every single penny of profit
goes straight to local charities.

12:12.041 --> 12:14.041
Oh, that's… That's, um…

12:15.166 --> 12:18.125
It's charitable, isn't it?
That's… Yeah, great.

12:19.625 --> 12:23.541
-You don't look very convinced, Hugh.
-No, it's-- I don't have any…

12:24.375 --> 12:27.875
You're not paying me to tell you what
you want to hear, you're paying me to…

12:27.958 --> 12:31.166
[inhales] …point out all the pitfalls
and stumbling blocks

12:31.250 --> 12:33.000
and problems you are going to face.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.958
Ah, and hopefully
to find a way around 'em.

12:35.541 --> 12:36.375
Yeah.

12:37.791 --> 12:41.041
Right, so firstly I'm going to need to see
the paperwork of those loans

12:41.125 --> 12:42.875
and the financials of your businesses.

12:42.958 --> 12:44.833
Phyllis has got all that ready for you.

12:44.916 --> 12:47.541
Great. I'll talk to Phyllis
and get back to you.

12:48.041 --> 12:50.916
-Nine o'clock, here tomorrow morning?
-Tomorrow?

12:51.625 --> 12:52.791
Uh, yes, okay.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.666
-Yes.
-Great to meet you, Hugh.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.458
Great.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.500
Welcome to Burnley.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.583
[man] Thank you, your worship.

13:04.458 --> 13:05.291
[gavel slams]

13:06.250 --> 13:10.708
In order to relieve pressure
on both hospitals and GPs,

13:10.791 --> 13:15.291
we need to find a way to bridge the gap
between primary and tertiary care.

13:16.041 --> 13:20.708
This proposed facility does that
in the most efficient and economical way.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.583
Doctor Ashforth.

13:23.583 --> 13:27.750
Shouldn't the NHS be the ones
to fund this facility?

13:27.833 --> 13:30.333
The National Health Service has agreed

13:30.416 --> 13:32.333
to fund the running costs of the facility,

13:32.416 --> 13:35.041
but we still need
the initial capital outlay.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.000
[incredulous] Which is considerable.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.500
And our limited resources
are already committed in other areas.

13:41.083 --> 13:45.083
Well… Burnley has already earned
the dubious distinction

13:45.166 --> 13:48.375
of being one of the most
deprived towns in the country.

13:48.875 --> 13:52.250
We're caught in a spiral
of neglect and decay.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.708
I mean, clearly something has to change.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.375
But change takes courage.

13:59.458 --> 14:04.000
That's a quality sadly lacking
in this council, and in this country.

14:04.083 --> 14:05.333
[councillors] Hear, hear.

14:07.666 --> 14:08.708
[gavel slams]

14:09.458 --> 14:11.583
[Hugh] I can't believe
I have to stay for the night.

14:11.666 --> 14:13.166
[Clarence, over phone]<i> You'll survive.</i>

14:13.666 --> 14:16.000
[Hugh] Starting a new bank.
He doesn't have a hope.

14:16.083 --> 14:18.750
<i>I told him that</i>
<i>but he wanted the chance to convince you.</i>

14:18.833 --> 14:21.583
-How much are we charging him?
-<i>The full whack.</i>

14:21.666 --> 14:23.458
Oh, no, we're not, are we?

14:24.583 --> 14:26.041
God, I feel bad.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.875
[scoffs] That's a first.

14:27.958 --> 14:29.625
[Hugh] <i>No, I do.</i>

14:29.708 --> 14:32.958
I feel bad I'm gonna have to
tell him to give up on the whole thing.

14:33.041 --> 14:34.250
<i>Well, my advice is,</i>

14:34.333 --> 14:38.458
let him down gently and then see if he's
willing to explore other opportunities.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.291
Yeah. Yeah, I guess…

14:42.333 --> 14:44.833
-Okay, thank you. Bye.
-<i>Alright. Bye, Hugh.</i>

-Huh?

15:08.791 --> 15:11.958
-Are you…?
-Yeah, I'm fine, thank you.

15:35.208 --> 15:37.041
Hey, hey, sorry.

15:37.125 --> 15:40.083
I was wondering when I'm gonna
get to see a doctor. I'm in a lot of pain.

15:40.166 --> 15:42.333
It won't be too long.
I'm afraid it's been a busy night.

15:42.416 --> 15:45.875
Don't know if this makes a difference,
but I've got a private health care plan.

15:45.958 --> 15:47.125
[scoffs]

15:47.208 --> 15:48.916
-What?
-Hear that, Dr. Ashforth?

15:49.500 --> 15:51.333
He's got a private health care plan.

15:51.416 --> 15:54.583
Oh! Well, wouldn't say that too loud.

15:54.666 --> 15:57.291
Round here we tend to believe
that health is a basic human right.

15:57.375 --> 16:00.041
Not a privilege available
to only those who can afford it.

16:00.125 --> 16:04.125
No, I'm not negating anybody else's pain.
I'm just saying I'm in pain also, okay?

16:04.208 --> 16:05.625
I've dropped a…

16:05.708 --> 16:08.083
A, uh… a car thing on my foot.

16:08.166 --> 16:09.250
Okay?

16:09.333 --> 16:10.791
-[Dr. Ashforth] Careless.
-Excuse me?

16:10.875 --> 16:13.500
Michelle, would you, uh,
give him some aspirin?

16:13.583 --> 16:14.416
Wait your turn.

16:16.166 --> 16:18.666
[barely audible radio broadcast]

16:25.875 --> 16:26.791
Oh, dear.

16:27.666 --> 16:29.250
-What's happened?
-[Hugh] Nothing. Just a…

16:31.125 --> 16:33.416
An accident changing a flat tyre.

16:34.250 --> 16:37.250
-Anything broken?
-Thankfully, no. Just my pride.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.333
You muppet.

16:39.125 --> 16:40.041
Is the car still there?

16:41.291 --> 16:42.208
Yes.

16:42.291 --> 16:44.750
I'll have one of the lads get it sorted,
brought back here.

16:45.458 --> 16:46.291
Thank you.

[Dave whistling]

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Fancy a brew?

16:53.083 --> 16:54.000
[Hugh] No, thank you.

16:55.583 --> 16:56.666
Look, Dave,

16:57.208 --> 17:03.166
I know I said yesterday that it was my job
to look for all the problems and pitfalls,

17:03.250 --> 17:04.166
um…

17:05.458 --> 17:08.000
but, actually, it's a bit worse than that,
because…

17:08.083 --> 17:09.541
[Dave] I know what you're gonna say.

17:09.625 --> 17:12.666
I know you're gonna tell me that
the Bank of Dave is never gonna happen.

17:13.375 --> 17:16.625
You're gonna say
that the Financial Regulation Board

17:16.708 --> 17:19.458
hasn't approved a new bank in 150 years.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.500
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.458
[Dave] We got Google up here too.

17:24.750 --> 17:25.666
But, please.

17:26.458 --> 17:29.250
Indulge me, hmm? Just for a day.

17:31.041 --> 17:32.666
There is method in me madness.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.833
-I promise.
-Okay.

17:35.916 --> 17:38.500
-Second loan I made were to Jamie.
-Okay.

17:38.583 --> 17:40.666
Come out here one morning
and it were quiet.

17:40.750 --> 17:43.375
His amp had packed up.
That's how he made a living.

17:43.458 --> 17:47.500
But with no bank account, no address,
where were he supposed to turn?

17:48.208 --> 17:51.125
So I got him a new one
and he paid me back two quid a week.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.291
-Two quid…
-Never missed a single payment.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.875

at top of a hill in Ribble Valley.

19:35.833 --> 19:36.791
Oh, shit. Hi.

19:36.875 --> 19:40.875
-Should've known you were Dave's banker.
-I'm a lawyer, actually, but, yeah…

19:40.958 --> 19:43.000
How's the bruised big toe?

19:43.083 --> 19:45.625
It's a bit more than bruised,
but it's okay.

19:45.708 --> 19:47.041
[Dave] You've met already?

19:47.125 --> 19:48.166
-Yes.
-Yeah.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.958
Hugh's advising me on setting up
this Bank of Dave.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.500
Which we need
to get our project off the ground.

19:54.583 --> 19:56.375
-Hmm.
-Sorry, what is that?

19:56.458 --> 19:59.000
You know all about
waiting times at the A&amp;E.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.750
Here, they're some of the worst
in the country,

20:01.833 --> 20:05.541
and it's because the people we deal with
don't actually need hospital treatment.

20:05.625 --> 20:08.916
Their ailments could just as easily
be treated by GPs,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.750
but it takes, on average,
11 days to get an appointment.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.625
And, well…

20:14.166 --> 20:16.375
No one wants to wait that long
when they're sick.

20:16.958 --> 20:20.333
So, we're proposing a walk-in free clinic.

20:21.125 --> 20:23.083
They can write prescriptions,

20:23.166 --> 20:25.958
run diagnostic tests, make referrals.

20:26.041 --> 20:27.416
Sounds like a good idea.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.541
-[Dave] Don't it?
-Yeah.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.291
The NHS agrees,

20:30.375 --> 20:33.083
but they've already
been pared to the bone.

20:33.166 --> 20:36.208
And the council weren't interested
so thought I'd try Dave.

20:36.291 --> 20:38.250
If you were to register as a charity,

20:38.333 --> 20:41.208
that'd be a huge incentive
for corporate sponsors.

20:41.291 --> 20:43.541
I mean, I know it's corporate, but…

20:44.041 --> 20:46.875
No, that…
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, actually.

20:46.958 --> 20:47.791
[phone vibrates]

-Oh. Sorry, I'm on call.
-Oh, right.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.458
-Got to run. I'll leave that there.
-Okay.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.416
Great.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.708
-Well, nice to…
-Yeah. Look after that bruised big toe.

20:58.208 --> 20:59.666
I will. It's fine now, actually.

21:00.416 --> 21:01.958
Not completely fine, but…

21:02.041 --> 21:03.125
-Right.
-Yeah.

21:03.208 --> 21:04.708
-See you, Dave.
-[Dave] See you.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.708
-Thanks.
-[Jenny] No, problem, Alex.

21:10.791 --> 21:11.750
So, she's…

21:13.666 --> 21:14.708
What's all this?

21:15.875 --> 21:18.375
All the projects that are too big
for me on me own.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.416
Um…

21:22.500 --> 21:26.333
-Up till now, I've helped create 150 jobs.
-Yeah.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.416
In here, there's hundreds more.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.625
-I get it, Dave.
-It's not just jobs.

21:31.875 --> 21:34.666
It's about the quality of life
for a whole community.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.583
This is all really impressive.

21:37.208 --> 21:41.458
Okay, but unfortunately, the Financial
Regulation Board doesn't care about this.

21:43.916 --> 21:45.666
Question I want you to answer

21:47.000 --> 21:49.083
isn't "can the Bank of Dave exist?"

21:49.958 --> 21:53.083
The question,
after what you've seen today,

21:53.875 --> 21:55.875
is "should the Bank of Dave exist?"

21:57.125 --> 21:58.375
Well…

21:59.791 --> 22:01.666
Yes. Yes, it should.

22:01.750 --> 22:02.666
Right.

22:04.083 --> 22:06.208
So, this is what I want you to do.

22:07.208 --> 22:12.666
I want you to file the necessary paperwork
with the Finance Commission Board.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.750
I know they're gonna turn me down,

22:16.875 --> 22:18.583
but I want them to tell me why.

22:20.583 --> 22:22.583
I want them to admit publicly

22:23.833 --> 22:25.833
that it's because I'm not in their club.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.958
I'm not part of the Eton and Oxford elite.

22:31.666 --> 22:33.083
I want them to say

22:33.166 --> 22:38.041
that the very same people
who've just lost 500 billion quid

22:38.125 --> 22:42.041
are the only people
entitled to look after our money.

22:42.666 --> 22:44.125
And you don't mind losing?

22:44.958 --> 22:46.416
Of course I bloody mind.

22:47.583 --> 22:50.708
But it's the price I'm willing to pay
to get them to admit the truth.

22:51.208 --> 22:52.083
Okay, yeah.

22:53.041 --> 22:54.000
Yeah, I'm in.

22:56.666 --> 22:59.166
I'll give your boss a bell.
Tell him you're still on the clock.

is that Eric used to be shop steward

23:21.166 --> 23:23.333
at the Michelin factory
before it closed down.

23:23.416 --> 23:25.375
And he was a real bloody troublemaker.

23:25.916 --> 23:28.916

-Thirty.

23:46.916 --> 23:48.916

23:49.000 --> 23:51.708
you gotta have someone
who knows how to play their game.

23:51.791 --> 23:56.916
I told Dave he was wasting his time with
the idea, but he's managed to convince me.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.416
-Dave can be very persuasive.
-Yes.

23:59.500 --> 24:02.333
I hope, for his sake, you're half as good.

24:02.416 --> 24:04.375
Well… hopefully.

24:04.458 --> 24:06.958
So, you received the first loan from Dave?

24:08.083 --> 24:10.750
Yeah. I were married to Ron for 38 years.

24:10.833 --> 24:13.916

I had very little money in the bank.

[scoffs]

33:13.333 --> 33:14.833
[water pouring]

33:17.125 --> 33:18.791
-Hey.
-[Hen] Hello.

33:18.875 --> 33:22.166
-How are you doing? Are you okay?
-[rueful laugh] Hmm.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.875
I have made you a very strong coffee.

33:25.958 --> 33:27.000
Thank you.

33:27.833 --> 33:30.833
Sorry about last night.
I was in shocking shape.

33:30.916 --> 33:32.875
Don't be. I was glad I was there to help.

33:34.291 --> 33:35.833
Can we go for dinner soon?

33:35.916 --> 33:39.208
You know, like normal people.
When I'm not completely off my face.

33:39.833 --> 33:41.416
Yes. Whenever you like.

33:42.583 --> 33:43.416
Tonight?

33:46.500 --> 33:47.333
Yeah.

33:47.875 --> 33:48.750
Um…

33:49.833 --> 33:51.041
Yeah.

33:53.083 --> 33:55.500
-How's it going?
-Good. Getting there.

33:55.583 --> 33:58.833
Excellent. Because I found someone
you should speak to.

33:59.541 --> 34:02.291
Sir Charles Denbigh. Friend of a friend.

34:02.375 --> 34:05.416
He was on the board of the FRB
until three years ago.

34:05.500 --> 34:08.500
These days, he mainly does
legal consultancy for hedge funds.

34:08.583 --> 34:10.291
And he's going to be helpful?

34:10.375 --> 34:12.208
This needs to go public.

34:12.291 --> 34:15.541
Spin Sir Charles a convincing yarn,
he won't be able to help himself.

34:15.625 --> 34:16.958
He'll be on the phone right away

34:17.041 --> 34:19.500
to his friends in high places
in the banking world.

34:19.583 --> 34:22.333
Then you can tap
into the one thing you have on your side.

34:22.416 --> 34:23.916
Everybody hates bankers.

34:24.458 --> 34:25.666
Precisely.

34:26.750 --> 34:27.875
Toodle pip.

34:31.708 --> 34:33.375
Everybody hates bankers.

34:34.375 --> 34:38.208
-[classical piano playing softly]
-[indistinct male chatter]

34:40.708 --> 34:42.333
[clears throat] Sir Charles?

34:42.416 --> 34:43.541
Hmm.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.583
Hugh Stockwell from Bentham and Green.

34:47.791 --> 34:48.958
Oh, you work with… Lawrence.

34:49.041 --> 34:51.583
-Yeah, Clarence. Yes.
-[Charles] Clarence?

34:51.666 --> 34:52.583
Oh…

34:54.125 --> 34:55.291
I've never met the man.

34:55.375 --> 34:58.625
In fact, until yesterday,
I'd never even heard of him. [laughs]

34:58.708 --> 35:01.000
But, anyway, you're here now, so…

35:01.083 --> 35:02.583
How can I be of service?

35:02.666 --> 35:03.666
Firstly, thank you.

35:03.750 --> 35:07.208
Everybody tells me you're the country's
leading expert on the banking system.

35:07.291 --> 35:09.875
Oh, well. I've put in my time.

35:10.791 --> 35:11.666
I'll be brief.

35:11.750 --> 35:16.500
I represent a client who is looking
into establishing a new retail bank.

35:17.166 --> 35:18.833
[whispers] Not an American, I hope.

35:18.916 --> 35:23.208
[laughs] No. The gentleman in question
is definitely English.

35:23.291 --> 35:24.208
-Yah.
-Um…

35:24.291 --> 35:26.250
The question is more about scale.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.875
In the rest of the economy,
we have large and small companies.

35:29.958 --> 35:33.000
We have a chain of supermarkets
and corner shops.

35:33.083 --> 35:35.291
-Greengrocers, butchers.
-Your point?

35:35.375 --> 35:36.708
Well, my point is,

35:36.791 --> 35:40.250
why do all banks
have to be like supermarkets?

35:41.041 --> 35:43.041
Isn't there room for a few corner shops?

35:45.500 --> 35:47.208
You're talking about Hoares.

35:48.541 --> 35:49.375
Am I?

35:49.458 --> 35:51.708
Oldest bank in the country, tiny.

35:52.583 --> 35:56.500
Caters for very exclusive clientele,
old money.

35:56.583 --> 35:59.375
No. Wh… What about people
on the other end of the spectrum?

35:59.458 --> 36:00.708
New money?

36:00.791 --> 36:01.708
No money.

36:03.708 --> 36:04.625
[puzzled laugh]

36:05.666 --> 36:09.708
I'm not… quite sure
what you're getting at, Mr Stockwell,

36:09.791 --> 36:12.666
but there is no right size of bank.

36:12.750 --> 36:14.875
The FRB exists to make sure

36:14.958 --> 36:19.083
that people's hard-earned money
is entrusted to the… [inhales]

36:19.166 --> 36:21.375
…well, right kind of chap.

36:22.250 --> 36:24.708
-[Hugh] The type of chap you can trust?
-Precisely.

36:24.791 --> 36:28.541
If their job is selecting
the type of chap you can trust…

36:29.875 --> 36:31.083
[puffs] …you'd have to admit

36:31.166 --> 36:33.875
they've been doing
a pretty piss-poor job, haven't they?

36:34.375 --> 36:37.041
-I beg your pardon.
-Anyway, thank you, Sir Charles.

36:37.125 --> 36:41.458
My client<i> is</i> the type of chap
people in his community can trust. So…

36:42.333 --> 36:44.208
I'm sure there won't be any problems.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.041
Thank you.

36:55.750 --> 36:56.583
[grunts]

36:56.666 --> 36:59.458
-[Hugh] What do you think?
<i>-</i>[Dave, on phone] <i>Looks bloody fantastic.</i>

37:00.166 --> 37:02.291
Wouldn't be surprised if they say yes.

37:02.375 --> 37:04.958
[chuckles] I don't know about that, Dave.

37:05.041 --> 37:09.708
I'm going to hand-deliver this
to the FRB on Friday, so speak soon.

37:09.791 --> 37:10.625
Okay?

37:11.375 --> 37:12.333
Cheers.

37:13.541 --> 37:15.041
How was your day, anyway?

37:15.541 --> 37:16.875
[sighs] Fraught.

37:16.958 --> 37:18.958
Everyone was being incredibly nice to me,

37:19.041 --> 37:21.333
which is a sure sign
they're gonna get rid of you.

37:21.416 --> 37:23.125
-How about you?
-Ah…

37:23.208 --> 37:25.166
I had a meeting with Sir Charles Denbigh.

37:27.125 --> 37:28.833
-You're kidding.
-Yeah, I did.

37:29.666 --> 37:31.666
-He's a legend.
-Is he, though?

37:31.750 --> 37:35.083
Yes. He was tipped
to be the possible governor

37:35.166 --> 37:37.125
of the Bank of England
before the recession.

37:37.208 --> 37:38.666
What did he want to talk about?

37:38.750 --> 37:41.000
Nothing. I was picking his brains
about something.

37:41.083 --> 37:44.333
-Um…
-Meetings with Sir Charles Denbigh.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.083
-Secret trips to the North.
-Hmm.

37:47.166 --> 37:49.791
-It's hardly secret, Hen.
-What are you involved in, Hugh?

37:49.875 --> 37:51.875
-Not involved…
-Come on, spill.

37:53.833 --> 37:56.583
I'm filling the formal paperwork out
at the end of the week,

37:56.666 --> 37:58.625
so till then,
it has to be just between us.

37:58.708 --> 37:59.583
Of course.

38:00.708 --> 38:04.583
I have a client
who wants to start a new bank.

38:05.458 --> 38:06.291
You're kidding.

38:06.375 --> 38:08.833
He's aware the FRB
will inevitably turn him down,

38:08.916 --> 38:12.291
but he wants to force them to go public
with what they think a bank should be.

38:13.916 --> 38:15.916
Well, that'll certainly stir things up.

38:17.125 --> 38:18.458
Your client's credible?

38:19.375 --> 38:21.500
[doubtful laugh] Yeah.

38:21.583 --> 38:23.541
He's certainly a character, but…

38:25.416 --> 38:26.833
But, yeah, I think he is.

38:27.833 --> 38:28.833
[Hen] Hmm.

38:35.375 --> 38:36.625
-May I help you?
-Hey.

38:36.708 --> 38:40.791
I'm here to submit a proposal
for the establishment of a new bank.

38:40.875 --> 38:41.791
[laughs]

38:41.875 --> 38:44.208
I'm not sure that's something
we deal with here.

38:44.291 --> 38:48.041
According to the Financial Markets
and Services Act passed in 2000, it is.

38:48.833 --> 38:50.125
Oh… uh…

38:50.750 --> 38:53.500
If you'd like to take a seat,
I'll find someone who can help.

38:53.583 --> 38:54.416
-Thank you.
-Okay.

38:56.541 --> 38:57.666
[phone clatters, dial tone]

39:03.500 --> 39:05.916
-Apologies for keeping you waiting.
-Hey.

39:06.458 --> 39:07.416
Edward De Thame.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.333
Hugh Stockwell from Bentham and Green.

39:09.416 --> 39:11.041
Here is the proposal.

39:12.375 --> 39:15.291
It's a long time since we've had
an application for a new bank.

39:15.375 --> 39:17.916
-150 years, I'm told.
-Indeed.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.250
-Right, we'll be in touch. Right.
-Brilliant.

39:31.750 --> 39:34.375
[man, over phone]
<i>Giles, Sir Charles Denbigh on line one.</i>

39:34.458 --> 39:35.500
[nervous grunt]

39:36.083 --> 39:37.125
[clears throat]

39:39.041 --> 39:41.041
Sir Charles. What can I do for you?

39:41.125 --> 39:45.125
Your friend Hugh Stockwell
is causing us problems.

39:45.791 --> 39:48.041
[Giles] <i>Hugh? He's not exactly a friend.</i>

39:48.125 --> 39:50.833
<i>We hired him a while back</i>
<i>just to do some legal donkey work.</i>

39:51.666 --> 39:54.708
He's just filed with the FRB
to set up a new bank.

39:55.500 --> 39:59.208
[Giles] <i>Doesn't sound like Hugh.</i>
<i>He's hardly a high-flyer.</i>

39:59.291 --> 40:01.500
Well, it's hardly
a high-flying bank either.

40:01.583 --> 40:03.125
More of a corner shop.

40:03.208 --> 40:06.375
I see. So, less of a problem.

40:06.458 --> 40:07.958
[Charles] <i>Quite the opposite.</i>

40:08.041 --> 40:11.416
<i>It's one thing rich foreign corporations</i>
<i>trying to home in on our business.</i>

40:11.500 --> 40:13.541
We know how to deal
with those buggers, but once…

40:14.083 --> 40:17.416
ordinary people start thinking
they can get in on the act,

40:17.500 --> 40:19.000
the floodgates'll open.

40:21.166 --> 40:23.791
Of course. I see. So…

40:23.875 --> 40:25.500
So how can I help, Sir Charles?

40:25.583 --> 40:27.791
<i>I may need to call on you at some point.</i>

40:27.875 --> 40:30.125
For now, I have the situation
well in hand.

40:31.291 --> 40:33.291
[soft suspenseful music playing]

40:34.750 --> 40:35.833
[exhales]

40:41.125 --> 40:42.666
[dial tone]

40:42.750 --> 40:44.583
[Hen, on phone]
<i>Sir Charles. Do we have a deal?</i>

40:44.666 --> 40:47.583
[Charles] Send me that page
and you'll have your promotion.

40:50.833 --> 40:52.833
[suspenseful music playing]

40:57.708 --> 40:59.708
[distant siren blaring]

41:03.500 --> 41:05.041
[sirens approaching]

41:05.125 --> 41:06.416
Bloody hell?

41:10.458 --> 41:12.000
[car door slamming]

41:15.458 --> 41:16.833
[indistinct voices]

41:19.666 --> 41:21.083
[radio chatter]

41:27.291 --> 41:29.125
[dial tone]

41:29.208 --> 41:30.583
[phone vibrating]

41:31.583 --> 41:32.541
Hello.

41:32.625 --> 41:33.958
[Alexandra]<i> Dave's been arrested.</i>

41:35.833 --> 41:36.916
On what charge?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.291
Loan sharking.

41:39.083 --> 41:40.250
[Hugh] <i>Really?</i>

41:41.041 --> 41:43.750
[hesitates] Um, I… I'll call you back.

41:49.916 --> 41:54.166
I can't find anything illegal here.
These are all person-to-person loans.

41:54.250 --> 41:57.458
Unless there's coercion or threats
of violence, it's not loan sharking.

41:57.541 --> 41:59.083
Go to page 11.

42:04.458 --> 42:06.125
I haven't got page 11.

42:07.083 --> 42:08.625
Probably still in the photocopier.

42:08.708 --> 42:11.666
You've got the photocopied version.
These are the originals.

42:11.750 --> 42:14.583
The first loan Dave made
was through Fishwick Motors.

42:15.458 --> 42:17.333
[Hugh] So what? He has a lending licence.

42:17.416 --> 42:20.000
He's allowed to lend money
to buy a van or a minibus.

42:20.083 --> 42:21.416
This is for funeral expenses.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.375
Surely that's just a minor technicality.

42:23.458 --> 42:26.708
It's illegal money lending,
for which you'll get a slap on the wrist,

42:26.791 --> 42:28.125
and a criminal record.

42:29.333 --> 42:31.833
-Of course.
-I told you they'd fight dirty.

42:38.125 --> 42:39.541
[Dave] This isn't a big deal.

42:39.625 --> 42:41.791
They let me out on bail
after a couple of hours.

42:41.875 --> 42:43.791
-But they did charge you?
-Yeah.

42:43.875 --> 42:46.166
-Can I see the charge sheet?
-[Dave] Alright.

42:46.250 --> 42:47.500
-[Hugh] Hello.
-Hi.

42:47.583 --> 42:49.166
[Hugh] This is actually very serious.

42:49.958 --> 42:52.541
The police said the magistrates
might fine me a few quid.

42:52.625 --> 42:55.541
-I'm not gonna prison.
-But you would have a criminal record.

42:55.625 --> 42:59.041
Which means you wouldn't be able to run
a financial institution.

42:59.125 --> 43:01.666
Exactly. If they get a conviction
for this, they've won.

43:01.750 --> 43:02.958
There's no more Bank of Dave.

43:05.166 --> 43:06.500
[Nicky] There you go, love.

43:06.583 --> 43:07.791
-[Dave sighs]
-[Hugh] Thank you.

43:09.541 --> 43:10.583
[Hugh clears throat]

43:11.208 --> 43:13.458
It weren't even supposed to be a loan.

43:14.083 --> 43:15.000
Sorry?

43:16.458 --> 43:20.666
The one they're talking about.
The first… to Maureen.

43:21.333 --> 43:24.166
-Yeah.
-I've known her and Ron for years.

43:25.333 --> 43:27.166
He deserved a proper send-off.

43:27.916 --> 43:30.708
I were happy to pay for it,
but Maureen didn't want charity.

43:30.791 --> 43:31.625
So,

43:32.583 --> 43:36.291
I used one of the forms from
Fishwick Motors to make it into a loan.

43:37.791 --> 43:41.125
When she paid me back,
I had to file the paperwork.

43:41.208 --> 43:42.291
[sighs]

43:42.375 --> 43:44.333
So… what's Dave's defence?

43:44.416 --> 43:46.416
-[Hugh] He doesn't have one.
-What?

43:46.500 --> 43:50.333
Sorry, but your husband committed a crime.
Obviously a very small one,

43:50.416 --> 43:53.125
and with good intentions,
but it's there in black and white.

43:53.208 --> 43:56.333
No jury or magistrate in the country's
going to find him not guilty.

43:56.416 --> 43:57.583
-It's…
-[Dave sighs]

43:59.750 --> 44:01.458
-[Hugh] If we…
-[sighs]

44:01.541 --> 44:05.500
If we could prove that the charges
were filed with malicious intent,

44:05.583 --> 44:09.916
and the intention wasn't to punish Dave,
but the wider Burnley community.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.208
It's a long shot but I think
it's worth a go. What do you think?

44:13.291 --> 44:14.250
[Alexandra] I like it.

44:14.333 --> 44:16.416
You'll have to put on
a hell of a performance

44:16.500 --> 44:17.791
to convince the magistrates.

44:17.875 --> 44:19.166
Like, "I want the truth."

44:19.250 --> 44:20.833
"You can't handle the truth."

44:20.916 --> 44:24.333
-Oh, I love that film.
-I've actually never seen it.

44:24.416 --> 44:25.916
-You've not seen it?
-No.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.291
I've just seen that scene.

44:27.375 --> 44:29.458
-Classic.
-I love it. Dave's not seen it.

44:29.541 --> 44:31.958
-Can we bring it back to me, please?
-[all] Yes.

44:32.041 --> 44:33.875
-What are we doing?
-Right, so…

44:33.958 --> 44:38.375
I'll come to the showroom and go through
all the numbers with your accountant.

44:38.458 --> 44:39.541
How can I help?

44:41.083 --> 44:42.166
Oh, well, um…

44:42.708 --> 44:45.708
Well, someone made the complaint
which led to the arrest,

44:45.791 --> 44:48.208
and it'd be great to find out who it was.

44:48.291 --> 44:50.708
I have a friend in the police.
I can speak to her.

44:50.791 --> 44:52.708
I can also speak to my sister.

44:53.208 --> 44:54.833
-Yeah?
-[Alexandra] She's a reporter.

44:54.916 --> 44:55.750
[Hugh] Great.

44:55.833 --> 44:57.375
No, you won't be needed in court,

44:57.458 --> 45:00.625
but a statement for the record
would be great. If you could manage it.

45:01.791 --> 45:03.333
Yeah? Brilliant.

45:03.416 --> 45:05.041
Okay, speak soon.

45:05.125 --> 45:07.083
Um… [clears throat] …Dave?

45:07.791 --> 45:09.125
-I just--
-[Dave] Hugh, come here.

45:09.208 --> 45:10.375
I want you to meet someone.

45:10.458 --> 45:13.625
This is Rick Purdey,
legendary music promoter.

45:13.708 --> 45:14.833
-[Hugh] Hey.
-Hello.

45:14.916 --> 45:17.208
Hugh's a lawyer from London,
but don't hold it against him.

45:17.291 --> 45:18.500
Fuck me. Double whammy.

45:18.583 --> 45:21.083
Yeah, Rick's managed some amazing bands.

45:21.833 --> 45:23.916
Really? Any I would've heard of?

45:24.000 --> 45:26.041
-Saxon, Bad Company…
-Okay.

45:26.125 --> 45:28.416
-[Rick] Def Leppard.
-No, shut up. No, you don't.

45:28.500 --> 45:30.125
[Rick] They're still going strong.

45:30.208 --> 45:32.875
I'm still in touch with the lads.
Rich lives down the road.

45:32.958 --> 45:36.000
Does he? I used to play a bit…

45:36.875 --> 45:38.083
Are you still managing?

45:38.166 --> 45:41.833
No, I got out. That end of the business
got a bit corporate.

45:41.916 --> 45:44.083
-Of course.
-Still keep your hand in, though.

45:44.166 --> 45:46.708
I spend most of my time
helping my son Jake.

45:46.791 --> 45:49.500
He's managing this great local
band called The Goa Express.

45:49.583 --> 45:50.625
Goa Express.

45:50.708 --> 45:53.333
Part of my job
is getting him a new minibus

45:53.416 --> 45:55.208
'cause they smashed up the last one.

45:55.291 --> 45:56.416
Rock 'n roll, eh, Dave?

45:56.500 --> 45:59.333
-You're getting mates' rates.
-Bless you.

45:59.416 --> 46:01.250
Rock 'n roll, yeah. God, Def Leppard.

46:01.333 --> 46:03.166
-I mean, I…
-[phone ringing]

46:03.250 --> 46:05.208
Eh… Um…

46:05.291 --> 46:06.958
-Nice to meet you.
-You too, mate.

46:07.583 --> 46:08.916
Hello. Hugh Stockwell.

46:11.333 --> 46:12.166
Vans?

46:12.250 --> 46:13.541
[giggling]

46:14.250 --> 46:15.958
I need to talk to you about Dave.

46:16.541 --> 46:18.000
-Fishwick?
-Yeah.

46:18.083 --> 46:19.791
Your lot arrested him a few days ago.

46:20.458 --> 46:22.958
Not us. London sent a team up.

46:23.458 --> 46:25.958
When we heard, we thought
they must have their wires crossed.

46:26.458 --> 46:28.791
Dave's an hustler, no question.

46:28.875 --> 46:31.416
And he's fond of the sound
of his own voice.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.916
-[both laugh]
-But he's hardly a loan shark.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.291
He lends a few bob
to friends and local businesses.

46:36.375 --> 46:38.125
Yeah, close to a million quid.

46:38.833 --> 46:39.666
You're kidding.

46:40.750 --> 46:43.666
We need to find out
who filed the original complaint.

46:45.708 --> 46:48.666
You know I can't share details
of an ongoing investigation.

46:48.750 --> 46:50.125
I think he's being set up, Vi.

46:50.666 --> 46:54.291
Someone's trying to use the police
and courts to take him outta the game.

46:54.791 --> 46:56.708
I just want to do what's right.

46:56.791 --> 46:59.791
I really think Dave
could do some good for Burnley.

47:00.291 --> 47:03.291
[Hugh, on phone] <i>Yes, but I'm a solicitor,</i>
<i>Clarence. Like you.</i>

47:03.375 --> 47:06.291
<i>I don't stand up in court</i>
<i>and shout at people.</i>

47:06.375 --> 47:08.416
But admit it, you want to.

47:08.500 --> 47:12.125
Yeah, but I don't think this is the
best time to indulge my fantasies.

47:12.208 --> 47:13.666
Maybe we should get a barrister.

47:13.750 --> 47:16.208
[Clarence]<i> They don't appear very often</i>
<i>in Magistrate's Court,</i>

47:16.291 --> 47:20.416
and when they do, the assumption is
that it's because their client is guilty.

47:20.500 --> 47:23.750
Yes, but in this case,
my client is guilty, so…

47:24.250 --> 47:25.916
[Clarence] <i>You'll do fine, Hugh.</i>

47:27.875 --> 47:28.708
Thank you.

47:28.791 --> 47:29.750
Thanks.

47:31.041 --> 47:32.541
Saw you on TV.

47:32.625 --> 47:35.333
Can you believe they finally
let me present my own story?

47:35.416 --> 47:36.875
You were brilliant.

47:36.958 --> 47:39.041
I always knew
you'd be the star of the family.

47:39.125 --> 47:40.416
Tell that to Mum and Dad.

47:40.500 --> 47:44.500
Doesn't matter what I do, you got into
Cambridge and now you're saving lives.

47:44.583 --> 47:47.583
-We're both not doing too badly, are we?
-Mm-hmm.

47:47.666 --> 47:49.875
We're finally out on the lash. Come on.

47:49.958 --> 47:53.208
No. No way.
I'm in surgery at 9:00 tomorrow.

47:53.291 --> 47:56.125
Course you are,
but we're celebrating my first big story.

47:56.916 --> 47:59.791
Speaking of…
Have you got your next one yet?

47:59.875 --> 48:01.333
I'm working on it.

48:01.833 --> 48:03.083
Got any ideas?

48:03.166 --> 48:04.208
I might.

48:05.291 --> 48:06.750
[Dave] I just sell minibuses.

48:07.416 --> 48:10.500
I used to sell vans. Any colour you like
so long as it's white.

48:11.208 --> 48:12.625
Just kidding. Any road…

48:13.208 --> 48:16.500
When I was selling vans,
I met hundreds, maybe thousands

48:16.583 --> 48:19.416
of small businesses.
Who doesn't need a van, right?

48:19.500 --> 48:20.916
But they all need money.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.708
To expand or survive.

48:23.375 --> 48:25.083
How's somebody in London

48:25.166 --> 48:27.958
supposed to decide
if they're a good investment? Hmm?

48:28.458 --> 48:30.833
I'm with Dave 100% on this.

48:31.333 --> 48:34.166
I mean, what kind of world do we live in?

48:34.666 --> 48:36.333
Where you can get prosecuted

48:36.416 --> 48:38.583
for trying to help those
who need it the most.

48:38.666 --> 48:40.875
-It's all we're doing.
-Hopeful of a good result?

48:40.958 --> 48:43.333
[Dave] If there's any sense in the world,
we are, yeah.

48:43.416 --> 48:46.291
-Ah, no. We're hopeful.
-We are.

48:46.375 --> 48:48.250
-It's all you got, innit?
-Yes, it is.

48:51.000 --> 48:51.958
[indistinct]

48:55.083 --> 48:56.083
Alright.

48:57.458 --> 48:59.041
[gavel sounds]

49:00.375 --> 49:04.791
Case 1220. Mr David Fishwick
on a charge of illegal money lending.

49:05.333 --> 49:07.583
Loan sharking?
Sounds like the kind of thing

49:07.666 --> 49:10.000
-we should be kicking up to Crown court.
-Hmm.

49:10.500 --> 49:13.458
[barrister] Your Honour,
despite the seriousness of the charge,

49:13.541 --> 49:15.875
prosecution will not
be seeking a custodial sentence.

49:15.958 --> 49:17.541
It can be dealt with here.

49:18.041 --> 49:20.833
Very well. Mr Fishwick, how do you plead?

49:21.500 --> 49:22.791
Not guilty, Your Honour.

49:23.625 --> 49:25.000
Well… Continue.

49:25.083 --> 49:26.291
[clears throat]

49:27.708 --> 49:29.208
The documents in front of you

49:29.291 --> 49:32.875
show that Mr Fishwick,
through his company Fishwick Motors,

49:32.958 --> 49:38.166
made a loan of £1,100
on October 11th, 2007

49:39.083 --> 49:41.166
to a Mrs Maureen Clayton for…

49:42.500 --> 49:43.875
funeral expenses.

49:44.666 --> 49:48.125
Now, in the second document,
you will see that Fishwick Motors

49:48.208 --> 49:50.583
is not authorised
to make a loan of that nature.

49:51.291 --> 49:53.333
[sceptical laugh]
And the charge is loan sharking?

49:54.083 --> 49:58.458
I am aware that the defendant doesn't fit
the usual image of a loan shark.

49:59.125 --> 50:03.291
However, the documents in front of you
prove beyond a shadow of a doubt,

50:03.375 --> 50:05.375
he has engaged in illegal money lending.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.375
He has broken the law
and must now face the consequences.

50:09.458 --> 50:10.458
[judge scoffs]

50:11.041 --> 50:13.500
-Are you representing Mr Fishwick?
-I am, Your Honour.

50:13.583 --> 50:15.208
Hugh Stockwell, Bentham and Green.

50:15.291 --> 50:18.291
Do you contest the veracity
of these documents?

50:18.375 --> 50:19.375
We do not, Your Honour.

50:19.458 --> 50:23.208
I'm assuming you will be presenting
some kind of defence for your client.

50:23.291 --> 50:25.958
No. We accept that Mr Fishwick,
on a minor technicality,

50:26.041 --> 50:27.333
did indeed break the law.

50:27.916 --> 50:29.208
Well.

50:29.291 --> 50:30.375
However…

50:33.083 --> 50:35.708
We are asking that you throw the case out

50:35.791 --> 50:38.625
on the basis that the complaint,
the charge and the prosecution

50:38.708 --> 50:40.666
were brought with malicious intent.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.083
And this malice
is directed towards Mr Fishwick?

50:46.166 --> 50:49.125
The malice is directed towards
the people of Burnley, Your Honour.

50:49.208 --> 50:50.333
[judge] Well…

50:50.416 --> 50:52.833
All three of us on the bench
are residents to Burnley.

50:52.916 --> 50:54.791
Are you saying the malice
is directed towards us?

50:54.875 --> 50:56.625
Yes, it most certainly is.

50:56.708 --> 50:59.875
You're being used to enforce
a corrupt scheme by convicting my client.

51:00.458 --> 51:04.791
I don't think we need to waste our time
listening to wild conspiracy theories.

51:04.875 --> 51:07.208
No, of course not, Your Honour.
Of course not.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.791
You may have noticed there's a great deal
of press interest in this case.

51:12.375 --> 51:14.625
They're looking for a story.
Ideally a simple one,

51:14.708 --> 51:17.125
where there's good guys and bad guys.

51:20.166 --> 51:22.916
I'd urge you to listen
to the evidence we have

51:23.000 --> 51:24.875
before deciding which side you're on.

51:28.041 --> 51:29.000
[clears throat]

51:32.083 --> 51:37.000
We will hear this case, but Mr Stockwell,
I urge you to be brief.

51:37.083 --> 51:40.333
This is not the Old Bailey and
this is not the time for grandstanding.

51:40.416 --> 51:42.291
Yes, I understand, Your Honour.

51:42.375 --> 51:44.875
But while this
might not be the Old Bailey,

51:45.375 --> 51:47.541
the justice meted out here
is no less important

51:47.625 --> 51:49.333
and no less worthy of our respect.

51:49.416 --> 51:51.416
-Too bloody right.
-[scattered laughs]

51:51.500 --> 51:52.458
Sorry.

51:53.416 --> 51:54.458
[indistinct]

51:56.291 --> 51:58.875
I'd like to call Maureen Clayton
to the witness box.

52:02.083 --> 52:04.458
Dave said he were happy
to pay for everything.

52:05.833 --> 52:09.041
But in my whole life,
I've never taken a handout.

52:09.916 --> 52:11.291
I've never taken charity.

52:12.458 --> 52:13.958
It's just not me.

52:14.708 --> 52:17.000
I'm the one who said it had to be a loan.

52:17.583 --> 52:18.958
It had to be official.

52:21.208 --> 52:24.958
[sobs] There wasn't a single day
that Ron and I weren't together.

52:27.875 --> 52:28.916
And suddenly,

52:30.083 --> 52:31.333
he were gone.

52:31.958 --> 52:33.250
And I were all alone.

52:37.291 --> 52:40.916
My mind is a total blank
about those first few days.

52:41.583 --> 52:43.625
I must have been in a right state.

52:46.416 --> 52:48.375
It were only… [exhales]

52:48.458 --> 52:52.000
…after the funeral
that I started to come out of it.

52:55.125 --> 52:56.750
And it weren't just Dave.

52:56.833 --> 53:00.416
Friends, neighbours,
folk I hadn't seen for years.

53:00.500 --> 53:03.500
They just popped by
and told me they were there for me.

53:06.041 --> 53:10.666
It were the only thing
that got me through those days and nights.

53:12.916 --> 53:15.250
And the loan from Dave
covered the funeral?

53:17.958 --> 53:19.000
And you paid him back?

53:19.083 --> 53:20.208
Every penny.

53:21.958 --> 53:26.541
I gave Dave the money and he gave it
straight to the homeless shelter.

53:26.625 --> 53:30.041
Those poor people really do need charity.

53:32.583 --> 53:33.708
Thank you, Maureen.

53:33.791 --> 53:35.833
[clears throat]
Your Honour, I think it's clear

53:35.916 --> 53:38.541
that the charge
of loan sharking is absurd.

53:38.625 --> 53:41.083
My client only had the best intentions

53:41.166 --> 53:43.458
and the charge hinges
on a minor clerical error.

53:45.958 --> 53:47.125
I should point out

53:47.208 --> 53:50.250
these charges were not brought
by the local Burnley police.

53:50.833 --> 53:54.416
A team was sent all the way from London
to make the arrest.

53:54.500 --> 53:55.791
Why all that time and effort

53:55.875 --> 53:58.583
for a crime that doesn't even
merit a county court hearing?

53:58.666 --> 54:01.583
Well… your answer is here.

54:02.416 --> 54:03.791
Over the last year and a half,

54:03.875 --> 54:08.166
Dave Fishwick has made
almost 200 perfectly legal loans

54:08.250 --> 54:10.166
to individuals and businesses in Burnley.

54:10.250 --> 54:13.375
These loans have created 150 jobs.

54:14.500 --> 54:15.875
Here are the documents.

54:16.416 --> 54:21.791
But now, my client wishes to expand in
order to help more businesses in Burnley.

54:21.875 --> 54:25.000
But in order to do that, he needs
to be able to take deposits

54:25.083 --> 54:27.041
so that he can reinvest that money.

54:27.125 --> 54:28.958
So, a fortnight ago,

54:29.041 --> 54:32.375
I submitted documentation
to the Financial Regulations Board

54:32.458 --> 54:34.416
to get him the necessary accreditation.

54:34.500 --> 54:39.208
And all of this
is to stop him getting that accreditation.

54:40.500 --> 54:43.000
-Why?
-So they can preserve their monopoly.

54:43.083 --> 54:47.208
But why all this? Don't they have their
own evaluation procedures in London?

54:47.291 --> 54:48.875
They do, Your Honour, yes, they do.

54:48.958 --> 54:52.250
But I suspect they'd rather
you do their dirty work for them.

54:52.333 --> 54:54.791
You can disqualify my client
in an instant.

54:54.875 --> 54:57.583
I also suspect
they'd like to avoid media scrutiny.

54:57.666 --> 54:59.666
Their image is already badly tarnished,

55:14.000 --> 55:15.625
We need to look at these documents.

55:16.125 --> 55:18.166

-Hey.
-[Alexandra] Hey.

55:26.291 --> 55:28.250
-You're doing alright in there.
-Thank you.

55:28.750 --> 55:32.250
Not quite Tom Cruise
in <i>A Few Good Men</i> levels, but…

55:32.333 --> 55:34.541
-Getting there.
-Yes. I think there's elements.

55:34.625 --> 55:36.791
-There's definitely elements.
-Thank you.

55:36.875 --> 55:37.958
Em…

55:38.041 --> 55:40.666
My contact in Bolton Police is here
and she got a name.

55:40.750 --> 55:43.166
-Yeah?
-Sir Charles Denbigh?

55:44.250 --> 55:45.583
No, you're kidding me.

55:46.791 --> 55:48.750
-Yeah.
-Oh, God. That piece of…

55:48.833 --> 55:52.083
I met him, but I didn't give him
enough information to start all this.

55:54.041 --> 55:55.291
I… I don't understand.

55:58.416 --> 55:59.625
Have you got a plan?

56:00.708 --> 56:01.708
Yeah, maybe.

56:02.416 --> 56:03.250
-Why?
-You…

56:04.000 --> 56:06.625
-You're doing that brow furrowing thing.
-Am I?

56:06.708 --> 56:08.250
Okay, sorry. I don't know what--

56:08.333 --> 56:11.833
Don't apologise. It's… it's sweet,
it's, em… [clears throat]

56:11.916 --> 56:13.250
-Em, so…
-Wha--

56:13.333 --> 56:15.416
-Sweet?
-[giggles] What's the plan?

56:19.750 --> 56:20.916
[gavel slams]

56:21.583 --> 56:24.666
[male judge] Let's continue.
Mr Stockwell. Mr Fishwick.

56:24.750 --> 56:27.250
All of this is very impressive.

56:28.083 --> 56:32.416
You are to be congratulated, Mr Fishwick,
for all you have done for our community.

56:32.500 --> 56:36.208
Whilst there is no question
that the law has indeed been broken,

56:36.708 --> 56:41.541
your argument that the prosecution
was malicious is compelling.

56:42.416 --> 56:43.375
However,

56:43.916 --> 56:48.625
in order for us to throw this case out,
we need proof beyond reasonable doubt

56:48.708 --> 56:51.833
that the banks were indeed behind it.

56:53.500 --> 56:55.000
Do you have this proof?

56:55.083 --> 56:56.041
I do not.

56:57.875 --> 57:00.666
-In which case, unfortunately--
-[Hugh] But…

57:01.416 --> 57:04.833
Perhaps the prosecution
has what you're looking for.

57:05.958 --> 57:06.916
[barrister] Excuse me?

57:07.000 --> 57:10.125
When you were given this case,
surely the police gave you the details

57:10.208 --> 57:13.375
about where the complaint originated.
That's standard procedure.

57:13.458 --> 57:16.708
Well, in this case, no.
I don't have those details.

57:17.875 --> 57:19.541
-You don't?
-No.

57:21.375 --> 57:22.708
Seems odd.

57:23.916 --> 57:26.291
Okay, so let me get this clear.

57:27.583 --> 57:29.375
-An anonymous tip.
-[scoffs]

57:29.458 --> 57:33.083
The kind that causes a team
to be sent all the way from London

57:33.166 --> 57:36.000
to arrest someone
for filling out the wrong form.

57:36.500 --> 57:37.666
I have no idea.

57:38.750 --> 57:42.458
-I have no idea what you want from me.
-I'd like the truth, if possible.

57:42.541 --> 57:45.958
Your Honour, this is outrageous.
I'm not on trial here.

57:46.041 --> 57:49.041
Perhaps you should be.
This is a court of law, sir.

57:49.750 --> 57:51.750
If you lie in here, it's called perjury.

57:51.833 --> 57:54.208
-Mr Stockwell.
-Apologies, Your Honour.

57:58.583 --> 58:00.666
Very well. As my next witness,

58:00.750 --> 58:03.583
I'd like to call a senior officer
from the Bolton Police Force.

58:03.666 --> 58:06.416
This individual has knowledge
of the case and will confirm

58:06.500 --> 58:11.500
that the original complaint came
from the office of Sir Charles Denbigh,

58:11.583 --> 58:14.083
formerly of the
Financial Regulations Board.

58:14.166 --> 58:16.958
He is one of the most
senior bankers in the country.

58:17.041 --> 58:19.041
The prosecution is aware
of his role in the case,

58:19.125 --> 58:21.833
but regrettably,
has chosen to lie about it.

58:22.916 --> 58:25.000
-May I approach the bench?
-No.

58:25.083 --> 58:27.375
[suspensful music playing]

58:27.458 --> 58:29.250
I was asked to keep his name out of it.

58:29.750 --> 58:31.541
[judge, incredulous] Asked by whom?

58:33.791 --> 58:35.000
I'm not at liberty to say.

58:35.083 --> 58:41.208
We will not accept this kind of subterfuge
and obfuscation in this courtroom.

58:42.083 --> 58:44.125
-Your Honour--
-No, enough.

58:44.208 --> 58:45.833
You are on very thin ice.

58:45.916 --> 58:48.666
Seeing as the prosecution
has admitted perjury,

58:48.750 --> 58:50.375
I think a mistrial is in order.

58:50.458 --> 58:52.708
-No.
-I can do better than that, Mr Stockwell.

58:53.583 --> 58:54.833
Case dismissed.

What do you think of him, sis?

59:28.208 --> 59:30.375
Not bad-looking for a socialist.

59:30.458 --> 59:31.750
He's from London.

59:31.833 --> 59:33.666
They have socialists there too.

59:34.625 --> 59:37.416
I didn't mean that.
I just meant, you know, he's…

59:37.916 --> 59:40.583
He's a lawyer.
He's part of the establishment.

59:41.625 --> 59:45.333
I spoke to Eric, who is slightly more
left-wing than Karl Marx.

59:45.416 --> 59:48.541
After hearing him in court,
he thought he was one of your lot.

59:50.291 --> 59:51.333
He did good.

59:53.291 --> 59:56.458
Well, despite coming from London,

59:56.541 --> 59:59.250
and despite being a lawyer,
which is even worse,

59:59.750 --> 1:00:00.875
you did good today.

1:00:00.958 --> 1:00:02.916
-Thank you.
-No, thank you.

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:04.666

[Dave] Hiya.

1:19:21.166 --> 1:19:24.708
For the last few months,
I've known that Maureen was sick.

1:19:26.791 --> 1:19:30.500
But I only found out by accident
that she had cancer.

1:19:32.583 --> 1:19:33.875
She didn't tell anybody.

1:19:35.041 --> 1:19:37.750
'Cause she, uh…
Well, she didn't want pity.

1:19:39.791 --> 1:19:42.291
She were a fighter right to the very end.

1:19:45.583 --> 1:19:48.666
Maureen were a nurse for 25 years.

1:19:49.750 --> 1:19:53.666
It's hard to imagine
how many people she helped.

1:19:53.750 --> 1:19:56.125
How many lives she touched in that time.

1:19:57.708 --> 1:20:01.208
When we think of a…

1:20:01.291 --> 1:20:05.291
we… we tend to think
of someone rich and powerful,

1:20:06.291 --> 1:20:07.375

who define who we are as a community.

It's not going to make us enough money.

Even if we charge folk 30, 40, 50 quid,
still doesn't add up.

So here's my idea.

1:25:22.958 --> 1:25:26.083
You can buy a ticket for, say, 35 quid,

1:25:26.166 --> 1:25:30.708
or you can put 100 quid
on deposit at Bank of Dave.

1:25:31.875 --> 1:25:34.333
In six months, you take it out,
plus interest.

-So you saw the concert for free.
-If Bank of Dave doesn't happen?

1:25:38.083 --> 1:25:39.583
Then you get your 100 quid back.

1:25:40.208 --> 1:25:41.458
The concert's still free.

1:25:42.875 --> 1:25:43.750
