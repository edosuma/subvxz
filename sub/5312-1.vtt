02:29.707 --> 02:32.127
In the late 20th century,

02:32.210 --> 02:35.672
hostile forces inside
the United States grow strong.

02:35.755 --> 02:40.051
The city of Los Angeles
is ravaged by crime and immorality.

02:40.135 --> 02:42.846
To protect and defend its citizens,

02:42.929 --> 02:46.374
the United States
Police Force is formed.

02:46.383 --> 02:49.678
A presidential candidate
predicts a millennium earthquake

02:49.761 --> 02:52.222
will destroy LA
in divine retribution.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.307
Like the mighty fist of God,

02:54.391 --> 02:57.310
Armageddon will descend upon
the city of Los Angeles -

02:57.394 --> 03:01.314
the city of sin,
the city of Gomorrah and Sodom -

03:01.398 --> 03:03.441
and waters will arise

03:03.525 --> 03:08.363
and separate this sinful,
sinful city from our country.

03:08.446 --> 03:12.742
An earthquake measuring 9.6
on the Richter scale

03:12.826 --> 03:19.457
hits at 12:59pm,
August 23 in the year 2000.

03:58.205 --> 04:01.333
After the devastation,
the Constitution is amended,

04:01.416 --> 04:05.712
and the newly-elected president
accepts a lifetime term of office.

04:05.796 --> 04:09.132
The country's capital is
relocated from Washington, DC,

04:09.216 --> 04:12.719
to the President's home town
of Lynchburg, Virginia.

04:12.803 --> 04:17.140
Los Angeles island is declared
no longer part of the United States,

04:17.224 --> 04:19.976
and becomes the deportation point

04:20.060 --> 04:24.898
for all people found unfit to live
in a new, moral America.

04:24.981 --> 04:27.776
The United States Police Force,
like an army,

04:27.859 --> 04:29.945
is encamped along the shoreline,

04:30.028 --> 04:32.364
making any escape from LA impossible.

04:32.447 --> 04:36.910
From the south-east of Orange
county to the north-west of Malibu,

04:36.993 --> 04:40.330
the Great Wall excludes LA
from the mainland.

04:40.414 --> 04:45.127
The President's first act as
commander in chief is Directive 17 -

04:45.210 --> 04:48.130
Once an American loses
his or her citizenship,

04:48.213 --> 04:53.176
they are deported to this island of
the damned and may never come back.

05:06.982 --> 05:09.943
Attention. We are on tactical alert.

05:10.027 --> 05:12.070
Remain at battle stations.

05:12.154 --> 05:14.823
I repeat, remain at battle stations.

05:51.651 --> 05:55.364
This is the Police Channel,
and this is Prime News.

05:55.447 --> 05:58.742
In a late-breaking story,
the Force has announced

05:58.825 --> 06:02.329
the arrival of the most
notorious outlaw in US history

06:02.412 --> 06:07.376
at Firebase Seven, the deportation
centre for Los Angeles island.

06:07.459 --> 06:09.586
Now this on-the-scene report.

06:09.669 --> 06:12.964
War hero. Criminal.
The Force's most wanted man.

06:13.048 --> 06:15.050
Convicted of 27 moral crimes.

06:15.133 --> 06:19.388
Arrested two weeks ago on a charge
of gunfighting for profit

06:19.471 --> 06:22.182
in New Vegas, Thailand,
US territory.

06:22.265 --> 06:26.103
It's been 16 years since
his famous rescue in New York,

06:26.186 --> 06:29.314
and the reports
of Plissken sightings...

06:29.398 --> 06:30.941
Commander?

06:31.024 --> 06:34.111
I'm still getting a trace
from the rescue team, sir.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.614
- Stationary signal?
- Has not moved from this location.

06:38.699 --> 06:42.077
That means he's hiding,
captured, or dead.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.287
So we go with Plissken?

06:44.371 --> 06:46.415
He's all we've got.

07:12.107 --> 07:14.276
Hello, Plissken.

07:14.359 --> 07:16.403
Welcome to LA.

07:22.284 --> 07:24.327
Come on. Move it.

07:28.915 --> 07:33.003
- That's Snake Plissken?
- What did you expect?

07:33.086 --> 07:37.007
He just looks so retro.
Kind of 20th century.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.968
Good old days. Let's get going.

07:44.681 --> 07:47.809
You are now entering
the deportation centre.

07:47.893 --> 07:52.064
You have been found guilty
of moral crimes against the USA

07:52.147 --> 07:56.234
and sentenced to permanent expulsion
beyond its borders.

07:56.318 --> 08:01.198
Failure to follow instructions
will be met with use of force.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.075
Look at 'em, Plissken.

08:03.158 --> 08:06.411
Prostitutes, atheists, runaways...

08:06.495 --> 08:09.373
We're throwing out the trash.

08:10.082 --> 08:14.211
"SD Bob Plissken,
Special Forces." Two Purple Hearts?

08:14.294 --> 08:17.589
Youngest man ever decorated
by the President.

08:17.673 --> 08:19.966
Rescued a different president in '97.

08:20.050 --> 08:22.177
So, what happened to you, war hero?

08:22.260 --> 08:25.389
You were the best.
Now you're just like them.

08:25.472 --> 08:30.227
You had it all and you turned away
from your country. Why?

08:30.310 --> 08:32.604
The whole nation's watching.

08:32.688 --> 08:37.484
Every good and decent person
who works hard and follows the rules.

08:37.567 --> 08:40.654
Be my guest.
What do you have to say, Plissken?

08:41.905 --> 08:44.282
Call me Snake.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.206
You are now entering
the processing area.

08:51.289 --> 08:54.668
The next scheduled departure
to LA is in one hour.

09:07.431 --> 09:10.517
You now have the option
to repent of your sins

09:10.600 --> 09:14.104
and be electrocuted
on the premises.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.314
If you elect this option,

09:16.398 --> 09:20.527
notify the cleric sergeant
in your processing area.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.870
How's it going, hotshot?

10:15.082 --> 10:17.125
You know, I got to admit.

10:17.209 --> 10:19.920
I thought we had you in Cleveland.

10:21.088 --> 10:24.883
- How'd you do it?
- Get to the deal.

10:24.966 --> 10:27.969
- What?
- You need me for something. What?

10:28.053 --> 10:30.097
Show him.

10:48.115 --> 10:51.702
At 1030 hours, Wednesday,
a group of government officials

10:51.785 --> 10:54.788
began a tour
of the Benford Space Defence lab.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.874
The President's daughter,
Utopia, was among them.

10:57.958 --> 11:01.670
During the tour, she came into
possession of a top-secret prototype.

11:01.753 --> 11:05.007
Then she boarded
Air Force Three for Lynchburg.

11:05.090 --> 11:07.134
To the American people -

11:07.217 --> 11:12.014
now is the time to rise up and demand
the surrender of the President

11:12.097 --> 11:16.727
and his corrupt theocracy
of lies and terror!

11:16.810 --> 11:20.522
At 1140 hours,
she hijacked Air Force Three.

11:22.065 --> 11:24.192
We scanned this onto the VR.

11:26.403 --> 11:27.821
Check it out.

11:27.904 --> 11:32.200
Today is day one
of a brand-new world.

11:32.284 --> 11:35.078
The days of empire are finished.

11:35.162 --> 11:38.415
To the President, my father...

11:38.498 --> 11:40.500
You know what's in here,

11:40.584 --> 11:43.003
and unless you open your borders,

11:43.086 --> 11:47.674
allow all the wrongfully accused
to return to their country,

11:47.758 --> 11:52.179
I will use this on you
and on the United States.

12:02.397 --> 12:05.650
Her emergency escape pod
landed somewhere in LA.

12:05.734 --> 12:09.988
Her ELT signal ceased immediately.
After that, silence.

12:10.072 --> 12:12.574
We sent a five-man rescue team.

12:12.657 --> 12:16.286
Within hours of landing
all but one was killed.

12:16.370 --> 12:17.996
Hell of a team.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.333
Skip the commentary, Plissken.

12:21.416 --> 12:23.335
Call me Snake.

12:23.418 --> 12:25.420
Get on with it.

12:25.504 --> 12:27.631
After her sister committed suicide,

12:27.714 --> 12:31.259
Utopia began to withdraw
into her virtual reality simulator.

12:31.343 --> 12:35.639
She'd punch up her own world
and stay in it for days.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.557
Somebody else was in there.

12:37.641 --> 12:41.561
Utopia made tapes of her VR
experiences and tried to erase them,

12:41.645 --> 12:43.772
but she missed one image.

12:43.855 --> 12:48.026
We found this fragment
on the end of her last tape.

12:48.110 --> 12:53.824
Cuervo Jones. Peruvian terrorist.
Shining Path member.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.951
Runs the Mescalito Justice,

12:56.034 --> 12:58.328
biggest, baddest gang in LA.

12:58.412 --> 13:03.208
Somehow, Cuervo Jones managed
to tap into the VR master data bank.

13:03.291 --> 13:06.336
Utopia was looking
for something to believe in,

13:06.420 --> 13:09.798
so he used her
to steal the black box.

13:09.881 --> 13:12.884
Sad story. You got a smoke?

13:12.968 --> 13:14.970
This is serious, Plissken.

13:15.053 --> 13:17.848
The black box is a matter
of national security.

13:17.931 --> 13:21.810
Looks like it belongs
to Utopia's lover-boy now.

13:21.893 --> 13:24.563
Yeah. We want it back.

13:24.646 --> 13:26.690
I'll bet.

13:27.816 --> 13:29.526
What's it do?

13:29.609 --> 13:33.238
Top secret. Only on a need-to-know.

13:33.321 --> 13:35.741
Evidently, I don't need to know,

13:35.824 --> 13:38.035
so fuck you, I'm going to Hollywood.

13:38.118 --> 13:42.456
If you go into LA,
bring back the black box,

13:42.539 --> 13:47.711
and you will receive a pardon for
every immoral act you have committed.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.796
Sounds familiar.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.132
An immediate answer.

13:52.716 --> 13:55.260
Yes or no?

13:57.804 --> 13:59.639
Who are you?

13:59.723 --> 14:02.392
I'm your president.

14:02.476 --> 14:05.145
I understand you got
some domestic problems.

14:05.228 --> 14:09.066
Put that black box in my hand,
and you're a free man.

14:12.069 --> 14:16.365
I can see you're real concerned
about your daughter.

14:16.448 --> 14:18.742
Utopia is lost to me.
My daughter is gone.

14:20.619 --> 14:23.830
- Last chance, hotshot.
- For what?

14:23.914 --> 14:25.415
Freedom, sir.

14:25.499 --> 14:29.336
In America?
That died a long time ago.

14:29.419 --> 14:31.463
I've heard enough of this.

14:31.546 --> 14:37.552
Explain to this foot soldier why he's
going to do what we tell him to do.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.263
What's he talking about?

14:40.347 --> 14:42.641
The Plutoxin Seven virus.

14:42.724 --> 14:47.312
Genetically engineered.
100% pure death.

14:47.396 --> 14:49.773
Complete nervous system shut-down.

14:49.856 --> 14:54.945
You crash. You bleed out like
a stuck pig. It's not a pretty sight.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.740
I see.

14:58.824 --> 15:03.120
You figure I'll do whatever you
want, just like New York, huh?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.872
- You got it... Snake.
- One question.

15:05.956 --> 15:09.126
Which one of you assholes gets to die
trying to stick me?

15:09.209 --> 15:12.796
You don't understand.
It's already in you.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.511
Catches on quick, doesn't he?

15:23.181 --> 15:26.768
Your countdown clock
is now activated.

15:26.852 --> 15:29.938
Designer viruses, Plissken.
Wave of the future.

15:30.022 --> 15:32.774
You've got less than ten hours
to live.

15:32.858 --> 15:37.654
It's already moving through your
bloodstream. Go on - touch that pad.

15:42.451 --> 15:44.786
Of course, there is an antidote,

15:44.870 --> 15:48.582
and it neutralises the virus
immediately upon injection.

15:48.665 --> 15:52.210
Which I will personally authorise
once your mission is completed.

15:56.048 --> 15:59.968
The man is too dumb to survive LA.

16:01.136 --> 16:03.597
We're holograms, Plissken.

16:04.014 --> 16:07.726
Give us a little credit.
We're not that stupid.

16:13.190 --> 16:15.650
Get this crap out of me.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.403
I guess we've got a deal.

16:24.868 --> 16:27.954
Nice to be working with you, hotshot.

16:29.456 --> 16:33.168
You'd better hope
I don't make it back.

16:33.251 --> 16:35.170
All of you.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.508
Core burner, magnesium ammo,

16:39.591 --> 16:42.010
500 extra rounds.

16:42.094 --> 16:47.432
Oral projectile. Mouth dart, filled
with urolyde. It will stun the enemy.

16:47.516 --> 16:51.228
Every member of the rescue team
had a tracking chip in his arm.

16:51.311 --> 16:56.441
One might still be alive. Use the
tracer in your watch to locate him.

16:56.525 --> 17:01.279
This holographic camera will project
your image up to a half-mile away.

17:01.363 --> 17:03.407
100% audio capability.

17:03.490 --> 17:06.284
It's a prototype.
Confuse and deceive the enemy.

17:06.367 --> 17:11.080
Its mini-nuke battery is good for
eight minutes, but only works once.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.458
Save it for when it counts.

17:16.670 --> 17:20.339
Plain old-fashioned matches.
Never know when you might need them.

17:22.884 --> 17:24.761
Where are my guns?

17:24.845 --> 17:27.347
I thought you might want those.

17:33.854 --> 17:37.774
Stealth clothing. Fire retardant,
nullifies heat detection.

17:37.858 --> 17:39.693
Put them on.

17:44.698 --> 17:46.825
I'll take the coat.

17:47.492 --> 17:49.327
You'll take 'em all.

18:43.090 --> 18:48.470
All right. LA's being primed as a
beachhead for an invasion of the US.

18:48.553 --> 18:51.807
War is being declared,
Plissken, or didn't you know?

18:51.890 --> 18:54.768
Oh, I forgot. You don't give a shit.

18:54.851 --> 18:58.146
Cuervo Jones runs Shining Path.
They want North America.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.982
The revenge
of preindustrial societies.

19:01.066 --> 19:03.610
Shining Path has united
Third World countries.

19:03.694 --> 19:06.363
The Cubans and Brazilians
will invade Miami.

19:06.446 --> 19:10.784
The Colombians are at the border,
we've got a full-scale attack.

19:10.867 --> 19:13.829
- High stakes.
- How am I going in?

19:13.912 --> 19:18.166
Under the San Fernando Sea. Shark
Three submarine, one-man submersible.

19:18.250 --> 19:21.962
Just like the turbine model,
only this one's nuclear-powered.

19:22.045 --> 19:25.340
It's very simple.
Throttle up, throttle back.

19:25.424 --> 19:27.634
Put ashore at the Cuegan Pass.

19:27.718 --> 19:30.721
Go through the mountains
toward the Hollywood Bowl.

19:30.804 --> 19:33.390
Locate the survivor
of the rescue team.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.684
He's your only source of information.

19:35.767 --> 19:38.353
- Do I bring him back?
- Negative.

19:38.437 --> 19:41.398
- Figures.
- He's probably already dead.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.609
Once you go inside,
you're on your own.

19:44.693 --> 19:47.738
Get the black box
back to the submarine.

19:47.821 --> 19:50.615
It's your only way out.
Plissken!

19:51.366 --> 19:54.077
You know what to do with the girl.

19:54.161 --> 19:58.582
We don't need to waste any more time
and money on bullshit trials.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.000
Kill her.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.544
Is that order from the President?

20:02.627 --> 20:05.922
Absolutely. Let's just say
it's best for the country.

20:06.006 --> 20:09.426
By the way,
who gives me the antidote?

20:09.509 --> 20:12.554
- A medical team.
- Neither of you?

20:12.637 --> 20:14.056
- No.
- Good.

20:17.434 --> 20:22.022
Thought you'd try that, hotshot.
The first clip is loaded with blanks.

20:22.105 --> 20:23.940
Bye bye, Snake. Good luck.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.781
Nice and easy now.

20:47.422 --> 20:50.717
- Com check.
- Yeah. I'm here.

20:50.801 --> 20:52.427
Stand by for launch.

20:52.511 --> 20:55.389
Eight hours, eight minutes,
26 seconds

20:55.472 --> 20:57.516
to neurosystem shut-down.

20:59.643 --> 21:01.728
Ignitor.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.192
Fuel rod injection.

21:10.612 --> 21:12.364
She's in the green.

21:12.447 --> 21:15.909
- Lock fuel rods.
- Locked.

21:15.992 --> 21:18.203
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.

21:25.002 --> 21:26.503
75% power.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.797
Hands on switches and counting.

21:28.880 --> 21:29.881
Five...

21:29.965 --> 21:31.883
four... three...

21:31.967 --> 21:33.927
two... one.

21:34.011 --> 21:35.804
Launch.

22:08.962 --> 22:12.591
Watch your speed.
There's lots of obstructions.

22:21.391 --> 22:23.977
His reactor's starting to overheat.

22:24.061 --> 22:27.022
Slow down, you're overloading
the power plant!

22:27.105 --> 22:29.399
You slow down, dickhead.
I'm dying.

22:29.483 --> 22:31.526
Plissken!

22:32.819 --> 22:34.696
Power plant overload.

22:38.700 --> 22:41.453
Guidance systems malfunction.

22:41.536 --> 22:43.997
You no longer have
control stick function.

22:44.081 --> 22:45.457
Obstruction ahead.

24:07.664 --> 24:09.708
Plissken.

24:10.876 --> 24:13.420
Yeah. I'm here. Cuegan Pass.

24:13.503 --> 24:17.382
'What happened to the submarine?
It disappeared off our screens.

24:17.466 --> 24:19.426
Plissken!

24:20.844 --> 24:22.971
I gotta go.

24:28.769 --> 24:31.021
Too bad about your boat, man,

24:31.104 --> 24:34.941
but we'd appreciate it
if you'd stay off our beach.

24:35.025 --> 24:37.069
Just passing through.

24:38.779 --> 24:41.406
You look kind of familiar.

25:47.931 --> 25:50.225
- What do you want?
- Nothin'.

25:50.308 --> 25:53.770
- I just recognised you, that's all.
- That's all?

25:53.854 --> 25:56.982
Come on, man.
I'm not looking for trouble.

26:02.362 --> 26:06.283
I used to see you a lot
when I surfed, on the Police Channel.

26:06.366 --> 26:09.578
You're pretty far out, Snake.
I mean, cool.

26:09.661 --> 26:14.082
But I kind of thought
you'd be... taller.

26:14.166 --> 26:16.335
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?

26:16.418 --> 26:18.420
Down that way.

26:20.589 --> 26:24.426
It's just an aftershock.
We get them all the time.

26:24.509 --> 26:27.804
Thanks for not killing me, man.
I owe you one.

26:27.888 --> 26:29.931
Acid rain.

26:30.682 --> 26:34.227
Hey, Snake,
what are you doing here anyway?

26:36.146 --> 26:39.608
I heard they busted you
pretty good in Cleveland.

27:02.464 --> 27:05.300
Location of rescue team member -

27:05.384 --> 27:07.719
50 yards from your present position.

27:20.816 --> 27:25.987
Location of rescue team member -
40 yards from your present position.

27:37.207 --> 27:41.837
Rescue team member is located
10 feet from your present position.

27:47.843 --> 27:51.388
100 bucks says you can't
put three blades into him.

27:51.471 --> 27:53.515
Want a throw?

27:54.725 --> 27:57.185
Hey, one-eye, I'm talking to you.

27:57.269 --> 27:59.938
Where can I find Cuervo Jones?

28:00.022 --> 28:03.525
What do I look like,
a fucking tour guide?

28:12.492 --> 28:16.121
- It's wintertime, baby.
- I'm looking for Cuervo Jones.

28:16.204 --> 28:18.457
Why? Hershe's looking for Cuervo too.

28:18.540 --> 28:23.545
- Where is he?
- He's on Sunset. He's gonna come by.

28:23.628 --> 28:25.130
Sunset.

28:25.213 --> 28:29.343
Boulevard. Ooh-hoo,
you really are new, aren't you?

28:29.426 --> 28:32.137
Come on, baby. I'll show you.

28:37.726 --> 28:41.646
Keep going down that way, honey.
You can't miss it.

28:46.234 --> 28:48.278
Hey, one-eye!

28:49.112 --> 28:53.075
Look in my face
when I talk to you, shit-heel.

28:55.786 --> 28:56.953
Whoa!

30:07.983 --> 30:09.568
Neurosystem shut-down - seven hours.

30:11.737 --> 30:13.155
Plissken.

30:15.866 --> 30:17.284
Yeah?

30:17.492 --> 30:19.911
Did you find the team member?

30:19.995 --> 30:22.956
Yeah, they're using him
for target practice.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.333
What will you do?

30:24.416 --> 30:27.961
Amigos, no matter
where you come from,

30:28.045 --> 30:32.758
or what colour you are, we're
all the Russia of the oppressed!

30:32.841 --> 30:35.552
- Watch the parade.
- What?

30:35.635 --> 30:39.097
We've got the north by the balls.

30:39.181 --> 30:42.017
Come on! Right? Right?

30:42.100 --> 30:45.395
Meet me at the Happy Kingdom.

30:45.479 --> 30:47.522
Let's party tonight,

30:47.606 --> 30:52.778
because tomorrow we're going to
start our way back to glory!

31:16.093 --> 31:21.640
Yeah! We got our freedom!
We got a future!

32:07.561 --> 32:09.688
That looks like Snake Plissken.

32:09.771 --> 32:10.981
Who?

32:11.064 --> 32:15.235
Used to be a gunfighter. Faded
out from the scene a few years ago.

32:17.738 --> 32:19.990
I hear he slowed down some.

32:31.376 --> 32:33.587
Doesn't look that slow, Cuervo.

32:33.670 --> 32:36.089
Watch it! Watch it!

33:01.490 --> 33:02.741
No!

33:02.824 --> 33:05.952
Nobody rolls into town
and disrespects me.

33:06.036 --> 33:08.914
Not Snake Plissken, not nobody.
Bolas!

33:28.934 --> 33:30.977
Take him out!

33:48.328 --> 33:51.164
I'm gonna give
you assholes a chance.

33:53.667 --> 33:56.253
What do you say
we play a little...

33:56.336 --> 33:58.255
Bangkok rules?

34:30.078 --> 34:33.206
Nobody draws
until this hits the ground.

34:36.168 --> 34:37.793
You ready?

34:50.974 --> 34:52.726
Draw.

35:11.078 --> 35:14.081
Hey, he left his coat here, man.

35:24.633 --> 35:25.967
Malloy.

35:27.928 --> 35:30.639
Plissken.
Have you got the black box?

35:30.722 --> 35:33.433
Negative. And I've lost
the core burner and holocam.

35:33.517 --> 35:36.937
I don't need to know your problems,
I just want my black box.

35:37.020 --> 35:40.941
You've got seven and a half hours.
Do you read me?

35:42.109 --> 35:46.488
Listen, Malloy. This guy's got more
heat around him than the President.

35:46.571 --> 35:49.908
I'll get your box,
but I need time, understand?

35:49.991 --> 35:54.204
Listen, Plissken, that headache that
just kicked in will only get worse.

35:54.287 --> 35:57.332
You're starting to feel
the effects of the virus.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.459
Soon you'll have a fever.

35:59.543 --> 36:03.672
Now, you bear that in mind.
Just push on through, soldier.

36:41.293 --> 36:45.005
Oh, don't shoot. Don't shoot.

36:45.088 --> 36:47.007
I thought it was you.

36:47.090 --> 36:49.509
Yeah, I recognised you right away.

36:49.593 --> 36:52.054
I've been hangin' round here
for years,

36:52.137 --> 36:54.806
but I never thought I'd see
Snake Plissken.

36:54.890 --> 36:57.601
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

36:57.684 --> 36:59.936
I'm Map To The Stars Eddie.

37:01.271 --> 37:03.648
Where's Cuervo Jones' place?

37:03.732 --> 37:06.443
He's the man with
the President's daughter.

37:06.526 --> 37:11.323
He's setting up something big, but I
got a feeling you know that, right?

37:12.449 --> 37:13.867
Location.

37:13.950 --> 37:15.160
That way.

37:16.578 --> 37:20.499
If you're going through Beverly
Hills, you're gonna need a map.

37:21.249 --> 37:23.710
It's pre-recorded.
I narrated it myself.

37:25.379 --> 37:28.465
Welcome to your own map to the stars.

37:28.548 --> 37:30.092
That's me.

37:30.175 --> 37:33.470
The big one wiped out the
entertainment industry in LA,

37:33.553 --> 37:36.515
but the glamour of Hollywood
is still alive,

37:36.598 --> 37:38.975
so come and see where the stars...

37:39.059 --> 37:42.020
Hey, Snake, you'll need this.
I'm telling you.

37:42.104 --> 37:46.191
I'll give you a deal. 50,000 bucks.
That's a real bargain!

37:46.274 --> 37:49.111
...Map To The Stars Eddie,
and here we go.

37:49.194 --> 37:50.529
Sucker.

38:22.769 --> 38:24.896
Stay down, man, or they'll see you.

38:24.980 --> 38:28.734
It's only their second shift.
Don't make one move.

38:29.735 --> 38:34.156
If you want to make noise,
go and find another bush.

38:34.239 --> 38:36.825
You're the one making all the noise.

38:51.506 --> 38:53.008
Ah, shit!

39:00.640 --> 39:03.435
Plissken's tracer just went down.

39:03.518 --> 39:04.728
Terminated?

39:04.811 --> 39:07.856
Yes. We can't locate him -
he's wearing stealth.

39:07.939 --> 39:10.692
- Now what?
- We sit tight and wait.

39:10.776 --> 39:13.653
Wait? For how long?
He's probably dead.

39:13.737 --> 39:15.614
Wait, Mr President. Be patient.

39:45.185 --> 39:48.563
I told you to stay down.
Look what you've done.

39:48.647 --> 39:50.691
I can't believe this.

39:51.733 --> 39:53.777
Are you Snake Plissken?

39:55.987 --> 39:59.074
You look like him... in a way.

40:00.534 --> 40:04.788
By the way, genius,
we're both dead meat.

40:12.754 --> 40:14.715
What are they?

40:14.798 --> 40:17.467
Surgical failures.

40:17.551 --> 40:19.428
They live here.

40:19.511 --> 40:22.931
Too many implants and face-lifts
over the years.

40:23.015 --> 40:25.058
Their muscles turn to Jell-O.

40:25.142 --> 40:28.520
They only survive
by having fresh body parts

40:28.603 --> 40:31.815
transplanted over and over again.

40:36.069 --> 40:37.612
Oh, my God.

40:37.696 --> 40:39.740
Who's that?

40:41.825 --> 40:45.078
The surgeon general of Beverly Hills.

40:46.455 --> 40:48.498
These are no good.

40:50.709 --> 40:53.003
You couldn't give them away.

40:53.086 --> 40:54.671
And this...

40:56.048 --> 41:00.135
I can do nothing with this one.
Wheel it away.

41:01.386 --> 41:04.097
I can't work with garbage like this.

41:07.059 --> 41:09.102
Now, these two...

41:11.897 --> 41:13.940
They look very good.

41:18.945 --> 41:20.989
My God, they're real.

41:37.464 --> 41:39.508
What a beautiful blue eye.

41:39.591 --> 41:41.843
Shame he only has one.

41:41.927 --> 41:44.304
Nurse!

41:44.388 --> 41:45.972
Still...

41:47.849 --> 41:50.060
One eye's better than none.

42:01.071 --> 42:04.324
Anybody moves, I'll blow
his brains out and then yours.

42:06.910 --> 42:09.121
You... get my guns.

42:09.204 --> 42:11.373
Now.

42:16.920 --> 42:19.339
Back off.

42:19.423 --> 42:21.591
Now, everybody relax,
and he won't die.

42:21.675 --> 42:24.261
Hey. Hey, man, help me.

42:24.344 --> 42:28.640
You'll never find your way
out of here without me.

42:28.724 --> 42:30.183
Really.

42:30.267 --> 42:32.269
Cut her down.

42:45.365 --> 42:47.159
Down there.

42:50.746 --> 42:52.581
Quickly.

42:55.792 --> 42:57.836
Get in.

43:20.484 --> 43:22.611
I think we lost them.

43:24.071 --> 43:26.073
I think we're lost.

43:26.156 --> 43:28.367
This way.

43:29.868 --> 43:33.955
I used to run guns
with the Black Jihad last year.

43:34.039 --> 43:37.376
We drove golf carts
up and down these tunnels.

43:37.459 --> 43:40.754
I know them
like the back of my hand.

43:43.215 --> 43:45.425
You are Snake Plissken, aren't you?

43:45.509 --> 43:47.427
I used to be.

43:47.511 --> 43:49.554
I thought you'd be taller.

43:50.889 --> 43:53.934
- What are you doing in LA?
- Dying.

43:54.017 --> 43:57.938
Ooh. But first
you got to find something?

43:58.021 --> 44:01.024
President's daughter.
She's with Cuervo Jones.

44:01.108 --> 44:03.902
You want to go to Cuervo's place?

44:03.985 --> 44:06.988
- I've been there once.
- Show me.

44:07.072 --> 44:09.116
All right.

44:09.908 --> 44:11.952
I always heard about you,

44:12.035 --> 44:14.913
like they couldn't catch you
no matter what you did.

44:14.997 --> 44:16.999
Very cool, Snake.

44:17.082 --> 44:19.960
Sooner or later, they get everybody.

44:20.043 --> 44:21.878
Up.

44:38.937 --> 44:42.482
Cuervo Jones' place is down that way.

44:42.566 --> 44:47.404
Get off at the Vermont exit.
Go south. You can't miss it.

44:47.487 --> 44:50.657
Be careful, though.
This is Korean Dragon territory.

44:50.741 --> 44:53.827
It's very dangerous around here.

44:53.910 --> 44:55.704
Bye.

44:57.622 --> 44:59.666
Snake?

45:01.668 --> 45:03.837
When you find
the President's daughter,

45:03.920 --> 45:06.465
are you going to take her back?

45:06.548 --> 45:08.592
No.

45:08.675 --> 45:11.720
- You're staying in LA?
- Not if I can help it.

45:14.139 --> 45:17.267
Sun is coming up in a few hours.

45:17.351 --> 45:19.478
UV's gonna be bad today.

45:19.561 --> 45:23.940
I know a place where
we could crash...

45:24.024 --> 45:26.068
if you want.

45:26.151 --> 45:30.364
My boyfriend and I
broke up tonight, so...

45:30.447 --> 45:33.116
I'd love to take care of you...

45:35.410 --> 45:37.829
and make you feel good.

45:38.955 --> 45:41.416
I'll read your future.

45:43.335 --> 45:45.712
The future is right now.

46:13.031 --> 46:15.575
...and condemn the innocent blood.

46:15.659 --> 46:21.331
Dear God, we call on you to be
our defence and our refuge.

46:21.415 --> 46:23.917
We give thanks for being alive,

46:24.001 --> 46:26.586
and pray that in your mercy...

46:28.130 --> 46:31.258
Snake, it's me - Taslima.

46:33.176 --> 46:36.680
I'm coming with you
to Cuervo's place. Yeah?

46:38.932 --> 46:40.767
They're new.

46:40.851 --> 46:43.020
They don't belong to any gang.

46:43.103 --> 46:45.147
They're just scared, that's all.

46:45.230 --> 46:48.233
That's how I was
when they first deported me.

46:48.316 --> 46:52.029
- Why are you here?
- I was a Muslim in South Dakota.

46:52.112 --> 46:54.239
Suddenly they made it a crime.

46:54.323 --> 46:57.659
I mean, why stay?
You can go south - Mexico.

46:57.743 --> 47:02.998
LA's still the place. What's happened
on the other side of the world...

47:03.081 --> 47:05.125
That's the prison.

47:05.208 --> 47:08.712
This is the only
free zone left... anywhere.

47:11.882 --> 47:13.800
Dark paradise.

47:13.884 --> 47:16.261
At least we get something.

47:17.429 --> 47:22.768
A girl can still wear a fur coat
if she wants to, for example.

47:22.851 --> 47:25.937
No, no, once you
figure out this place,

47:26.021 --> 47:28.815
it's really not so bad.

47:29.900 --> 47:31.943
Get down!

47:47.751 --> 47:50.295
Where's it coming from?

47:50.379 --> 47:53.298
The car in the street below!

48:31.420 --> 48:34.089
Hop in, Snake. Come on.

48:38.719 --> 48:42.514
Nobody ever gets out
of Beverly Hills alive.

48:42.597 --> 48:47.519
- That's why you let me go there.
- You need one of my maps.

48:49.730 --> 48:52.858
Listen to me, Snake.
I got connections here.

48:52.941 --> 48:56.319
You can't just walk around
without knowing the ropes.

48:56.403 --> 48:58.613
Take the wrong street, you're dead.

48:58.697 --> 49:00.449
Stop the car.

49:00.532 --> 49:03.201
All right, anything you say.

49:03.285 --> 49:06.705
Although I was going to take you
to Cuervo Jones' place.

49:06.788 --> 49:10.292
- Where is it?
- Right over there.

49:18.383 --> 49:22.721
It's pretty neat, huh?
It's Cuervo's car. He lets me use it.

49:22.804 --> 49:26.475
Don't worry, you've just
been shot with a fun gun.

49:26.558 --> 49:28.435
Feel it? You feel it?

49:28.518 --> 49:31.480
It's pure mesh, man.
100-proof artery choker.

49:31.563 --> 49:36.360
When the hit pulls you an inch
from death, that is living.

49:36.443 --> 49:40.280
I'm actually Cuervo's agent,
I'd love to represent you too.

49:40.364 --> 49:43.575
We could make a bundle.
Help your career.

49:43.659 --> 49:47.204
Last couple of years,
it's like you've disappeared...

49:49.122 --> 49:52.167
I know what the cops sent him to do.

49:52.250 --> 49:56.713
Plissken was the second rescue team,
looking for the box and the girl.

49:56.797 --> 50:02.386
All I'm asking for is a finder's fee.
Maybe Wisconsin. I don't know.

50:02.469 --> 50:05.555
- We're almost set up, Cuervo.
- Good.

50:07.724 --> 50:13.313
I originally heard about this
when I was working for NASA.

50:13.397 --> 50:18.610
Common, ordinary remote-control unit.
Yeah? Everyone's got one, right?

50:18.694 --> 50:21.363
Here's the kicker.

50:21.446 --> 50:26.118
This instruction disk hooks you
into the Sword of Damocles,

50:26.201 --> 50:28.370
the ultimate defensive weapon system.

50:31.957 --> 50:33.792
You see that?

50:33.875 --> 50:36.545
A ring of satellites
encircling the earth.

50:36.628 --> 50:40.966
Attached to each satellite
is a mega neutron bomb.

50:41.049 --> 50:43.552
When detonated, each satellite

50:43.635 --> 50:46.388
unleashes an intense
electromagnetic pulse,

50:46.471 --> 50:48.890
but EMP doesn't harm a living thing.

50:48.974 --> 50:54.187
But it does shut down every known
power source, all electrical devices,

50:54.271 --> 50:56.648
cars, aeroplanes, toasters,

50:56.732 --> 50:59.317
computers, everything...
even batteries.

50:59.401 --> 51:04.948
But this... makes this
an aiming device

51:05.032 --> 51:08.910
that gives the user
incredible accuracy.

51:08.994 --> 51:12.789
You can pinpoint precisely
what you want to shut down.

51:12.873 --> 51:17.252
A taxi cab in Buenos Aires,
the entire country of Spain. Amazing.

51:17.336 --> 51:20.339
You could shut down the whole planet,

51:20.422 --> 51:23.091
send it right back to the Dark Ages.

51:24.176 --> 51:26.178
- He's dead.
- I agree.

51:26.261 --> 51:30.182
Plissken's been dead before,
but he never stays down.

51:30.265 --> 51:32.309
The mission's scrubbed, Commander.

51:32.392 --> 51:35.687
I shouldn't have let you
talk me out of that air strike.

51:35.771 --> 51:40.859
Well, it's on now, effective
immediately. Full-scale.

51:40.942 --> 51:43.862
Target Los Angeles.
Flatten it. Burn it.

51:43.945 --> 51:45.072
No!

51:48.450 --> 51:50.410
What did you say?

51:50.494 --> 51:54.164
Cuervo Jones is holding
all the cards now, sir.

51:54.247 --> 51:57.626
He sees our aircraft,
he pushes that button... kaboom!

51:57.709 --> 52:01.171
There goes our aircraft
AND the United States.

52:02.297 --> 52:07.010
We don't even know if he knows
how to work the goddam thing.

52:07.094 --> 52:10.013
Snake Plissken, American outlaw.

52:10.097 --> 52:11.932
You'll like this.

52:13.392 --> 52:17.688
Remember, Cuevo, you've got to punch
in the world code first - 666.

52:17.771 --> 52:20.732
That brings all
the satellites on line.

52:20.816 --> 52:23.485
Eh, pendejo, you think I'm stupid?

52:23.568 --> 52:26.113
No. No. No. I'm sorry, Cuervo.

52:26.196 --> 52:27.990
Bring them in.

52:31.743 --> 52:33.787
OK, OK, go on.

52:36.039 --> 52:40.377
'Hello, North America.
Buenas noches, Sud America.

52:40.460 --> 52:45.007
Yes, I am Cuervo Jones...

52:45.090 --> 52:46.883
Wait a minute.

52:46.967 --> 52:48.510
That's Plissken.

52:48.593 --> 52:52.472
This is LA, people without
hope or a country.

52:52.556 --> 52:54.307
I knew it. He's alive.

52:54.391 --> 52:58.020
You know what they want - liberation.

52:58.103 --> 53:00.522
Now it's their turn.

53:00.605 --> 53:03.525
I am taking over with this.

53:05.569 --> 53:08.989
I told you not to try
to get this back, didn't I?

53:09.072 --> 53:12.451
But you disobeyed me. Well...

53:13.618 --> 53:15.871
He's entering the target code.

53:15.954 --> 53:18.874
Bend over, Mr President.

53:18.957 --> 53:21.209
Time for a spanking.

53:21.293 --> 53:24.921
He's targeting Lynchburg.
That'll shut down the capital.

53:25.005 --> 53:26.923
Get me the White House.

53:27.007 --> 53:31.511
- This broadcast is live...
- Get me my wife, please.

53:31.595 --> 53:35.098
- Are you watching TV?
- Yes, I'm watching it.

53:35.182 --> 53:36.767
Yes, I know.

53:36.850 --> 53:38.352
Curfew.

53:38.435 --> 53:41.521
Hello? Hello?

53:41.605 --> 53:43.774
Hey, Presidente,

53:43.857 --> 53:45.942
silence is golden, no?

53:46.026 --> 53:50.155
Don't tell me you didn't
enjoy this just a little bit.

53:50.238 --> 53:53.533
I mean, if your wife's
anything like your daughter,

53:53.617 --> 53:56.953
she's sweet,
but you just can't shut her up.

53:57.037 --> 53:59.206
Knock it off, Cuervo.

53:59.289 --> 54:01.541
All right, now this is set.

54:01.625 --> 54:05.545
We shut down
the entire United States.

54:05.545 --> 54:10.050
I want a police chopper to come
and get me at the Happy Kingdom,

54:10.133 --> 54:12.177
no later than 5am.

54:12.260 --> 54:16.890
Once I'm airborne,
you'll get your orders.

54:16.973 --> 54:22.270
Remember, don't piss me off,
or I'll... pull the plug.

54:23.021 --> 54:26.149
I'm at the mercy of this madman.

54:26.233 --> 54:28.485
Don't count Plissken out, sir.

54:28.568 --> 54:31.113
He's tanked. He's a POW.

54:31.196 --> 54:32.406
But he's still alive.

55:51.818 --> 55:57.115
Six, five, four, three, two, one!

56:01.328 --> 56:03.538
Shot clock!

56:23.558 --> 56:25.560
Get him. Get him up.

56:33.568 --> 56:35.487
But this is insane.

56:35.570 --> 56:38.573
It is. That's the point.

56:59.094 --> 57:01.346
All right, all right.

57:10.313 --> 57:13.608
I promised you tonight
was going to be special.

57:13.692 --> 57:19.698
I also promised one last spectacle
of death in this historic arena.

57:19.781 --> 57:22.492
Now you will see that death.

57:22.576 --> 57:24.953
I give you...

57:25.037 --> 57:30.959
the death of Snake Plissken!

57:47.309 --> 57:49.895
Some people think
you're already dead, Snake.

57:49.978 --> 57:52.272
Some say you never will be.

57:52.356 --> 57:54.900
You may have survived Cleveland,

57:54.983 --> 57:58.236
you may have
escaped from New York,

57:58.320 --> 58:00.489
but this is LA, vato.

58:00.572 --> 58:06.703
And you're about to find out that
this fucking city can kill anybody!

58:06.787 --> 58:09.039
LA! LA!

58:24.971 --> 58:27.599
Game time!

58:32.938 --> 58:34.690
Basketball.

58:34.773 --> 58:38.276
Two hoops. Full court.
10-second shot clock.

58:38.360 --> 58:40.153
Miss a shot - get shot.

58:40.237 --> 58:43.448
Buzzer goes off
before you shoot - get shot.

58:43.532 --> 58:46.493
Two points for a basket.
No three-point bullshit.

58:46.576 --> 58:50.789
All you got to do is make
10 points. That's it.

58:53.959 --> 58:55.377
By the way,

58:55.460 --> 58:59.548
nobody's ever walked
off that court alive.

58:59.631 --> 59:01.383
Nobody.

59:07.472 --> 59:09.016
All right!

59:25.907 --> 59:28.660
Six, five, four...

59:28.744 --> 59:30.412
three, two,

59:30.495 --> 59:31.788
one!

59:39.671 --> 59:42.174
Five, four...

59:42.257 --> 59:44.926
three, two, one!

59:54.644 --> 59:57.314
- Nice shot.
- He's getting tired now.

59:57.397 --> 01:00:01.068
Four, three, two, one!

01:01:04.214 --> 01:01:06.091
This town loves a winner.

01:01:16.143 --> 01:01:18.186
He won, Cuervo.

01:01:22.065 --> 01:01:25.277
- You can't kill him.
- I have to.

01:01:32.617 --> 01:01:34.244
Get off!

01:01:41.043 --> 01:01:42.586
It's the big one!

01:01:54.598 --> 01:01:56.516
Find him!

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.018
We're going to Anaheim.

01:01:58.101 --> 01:01:59.102
Come here.

01:02:01.021 --> 01:02:05.108
Cuervo. Cuervo, wait up.
Give me a minute!

01:02:05.192 --> 01:02:08.737
- Get lost, agent!
- We got a relationship here, man.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.864
Let me make something clear.

01:02:10.947 --> 01:02:14.034
I'm getting irritated,
and that's not good.

01:02:14.117 --> 01:02:18.538
Irritated with me? Cuervo, I'm
taking care of you, understand?

01:02:18.622 --> 01:02:21.958
- We can't find him, Cuervo.
- Keep looking!

01:02:30.592 --> 01:02:32.636
Get in the car.

01:02:35.639 --> 01:02:39.226
If I'm being too rough on you,
just let me know.

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:26.606
Snake, don't shoot. It's me - Utopia.

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:28.984
I'm alone.

01:03:29.067 --> 01:03:31.570
This whole place is a nightmare.

01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:35.574
Cuervo's a killer.

01:03:35.657 --> 01:03:37.743
He's worse than my father.

01:03:37.826 --> 01:03:41.288
I want to go back with you.

01:03:46.251 --> 01:03:48.295
Oh, my God.

01:03:48.378 --> 01:03:51.882
My father sent you
to kill me, didn't he?

01:03:57.012 --> 01:03:58.930
Shut up.

01:03:59.014 --> 01:04:00.932
Get out of here.

01:04:03.018 --> 01:04:04.519
Go.

01:04:04.603 --> 01:04:07.981
Wait. You can't
take that back, Snake.

01:04:08.065 --> 01:04:10.942
Oh, God.
You can't give that to him.

01:04:11.026 --> 01:04:14.696
He wants to control everything,
just like Cuervo.

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:18.200
If I don't take it back, I'm dead.

01:04:23.372 --> 01:04:24.706
Another one?

01:04:39.388 --> 01:04:40.514
Run!

01:04:52.025 --> 01:04:53.652
It's over.

01:04:53.735 --> 01:04:56.822
Get me a damage report
as soon as possible.

01:04:56.905 --> 01:04:58.490
Yes, sir.

01:04:58.573 --> 01:05:00.909
Oh, thank God almighty.

01:05:00.993 --> 01:05:05.914
Maybe that's the answer
to all of our problems.

01:05:05.998 --> 01:05:09.918
Maybe... maybe they're all dead.

01:05:10.002 --> 01:05:11.878
Maybe.

01:05:14.006 --> 01:05:17.884
Oh, Cuervo, man!
We almost bought the farm.

01:05:17.968 --> 01:05:20.762
The whole place
just fell in right behind us.

01:05:22.014 --> 01:05:24.057
Where is Plissken?

01:05:24.141 --> 01:05:28.520
He's down there. He's dead.
He's history, and I did it.

01:05:28.603 --> 01:05:30.522
I killed him. I shot him.

01:05:30.605 --> 01:05:32.649
Right? Tell him.

01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:37.904
Give it to me.

01:05:37.988 --> 01:05:41.533
Oh, yeah. I brought it
back to you, Cuervo.

01:05:41.616 --> 01:05:43.660
It's all there.

01:05:56.381 --> 01:05:59.718
Whoa, dude, is that you, Snake?

01:05:59.801 --> 01:06:01.928
Far out, man.

01:06:02.012 --> 01:06:04.890
Hey, did you find Cuervo, man?

01:06:04.973 --> 01:06:07.559
Hey, Cuervo, wait.
I've done it all, man.

01:06:07.642 --> 01:06:11.646
I killed Plissken.
I got your girl back for you...

01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:13.148
So where is he?

01:06:13.231 --> 01:06:15.484
I shot him.

01:06:15.567 --> 01:06:17.527
He went down, OK?

01:06:17.611 --> 01:06:20.906
His body's probably in
Wilshire Canyon somewhere.

01:06:20.989 --> 01:06:23.909
Good! So then you know where he is.

01:06:23.992 --> 01:06:26.036
Bring me his head.

01:06:30.957 --> 01:06:34.211
- Where's the Happy Kingdom?
- Anaheim. The invasion staging area.

01:06:34.294 --> 01:06:36.713
Everyone's gonna be there,
except me.

01:06:36.797 --> 01:06:41.301
I'm staying here, man,
I'm ready for the big wave.

01:06:41.385 --> 01:06:43.553
- Take me there.
- What?

01:06:43.637 --> 01:06:44.763
Take me there.

01:06:44.846 --> 01:06:47.599
You're not well, Snake.
You need help.

01:06:47.683 --> 01:06:49.685
Hold on.

01:06:49.768 --> 01:06:52.938
- Who shot you?
- It doesn't matter.

01:06:53.021 --> 01:06:54.523
Yeah, you're right.

01:06:54.606 --> 01:06:56.900
Talk to Hershe.
She hates Cuervo.

01:06:56.984 --> 01:07:00.404
They used to be partners,
and they split up.

01:07:00.487 --> 01:07:03.115
- Who?
- Hershe.

01:07:03.198 --> 01:07:06.910
She lives in a big boat.
Hangs with Saigon Shadow.

01:07:06.994 --> 01:07:09.621
Man, they don't take shit
from nobody.

01:07:09.705 --> 01:07:12.207
What is that?

01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:14.543
Tsunami, Snake. Tsunami! Woo!

01:07:14.626 --> 01:07:17.921
Surf's up big-time now,
mister. Ha ha!

01:07:18.005 --> 01:07:22.926
Start feeling better quick, man,
cos you ain't got time to escape.

01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:26.680
This is going to be some ride, man,
some kind of bitchin' ride.

01:07:26.763 --> 01:07:28.890
Let's go. Come on.

01:07:28.974 --> 01:07:31.518
Bitchin', man.

01:07:33.395 --> 01:07:38.150
Let the front edge pick you up. Don't
get on till you ride to the top.

01:07:38.233 --> 01:07:43.864
Don't blow it, man. If you fall off,
it's the big wipe-out. Got it?

01:07:43.947 --> 01:07:46.158
Whoo! Bitchin'.

01:07:46.658 --> 01:07:48.702
Hang on, Snake.

01:08:14.436 --> 01:08:16.647
You got to be kidding me.

01:08:20.233 --> 01:08:21.943
Later.

01:08:22.027 --> 01:08:23.987
Ooh, Snake!

01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:22.170
Tell me how to get downtown -
somebody named Hershe.

01:09:22.254 --> 01:09:25.048
- Sure, Snake. No problem.
- Hey, hey!

01:09:25.131 --> 01:09:27.676
Are you going to kill me?

01:09:27.759 --> 01:09:29.469
Hershe.

01:09:29.553 --> 01:09:32.305
Right. Keep straight.
Two blocks down, right.

01:09:42.607 --> 01:09:46.403
Warning.
Neurosystem shut-down. One hour.

01:10:06.048 --> 01:10:08.925
I first met Hershe
when I got deported.

01:10:09.009 --> 01:10:12.554
She helped set me up.
We're talking a power player.

01:10:12.637 --> 01:10:17.934
Cuervo's got numbers and firepower,
but Hershe's got big-time ambitions.

01:10:18.018 --> 01:10:22.856
The two of you hooked up together,
I'm talking box-office material.

01:10:22.939 --> 01:10:24.775
What?

01:10:26.652 --> 01:10:30.906
Easy, Snake. I see him, too.
We're OK. Come on.

01:10:30.989 --> 01:10:34.284
She's going to love you, Snake.
You'll love her, too.

01:10:34.368 --> 01:10:36.536
We'll make this thing happen.

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:40.540
I'm through with Cuervo. The guy's
got no sense of loyalty whatsoever.

01:10:40.624 --> 01:10:41.625
Through here.

01:10:43.377 --> 01:10:44.544
What?

01:10:44.628 --> 01:10:47.255
How you doin'? Long time, no see.

01:10:47.339 --> 01:10:49.925
Remember me? Map To The Stars Eddie.

01:10:50.008 --> 01:10:52.969
I got somebody I want Hershe to meet,

01:10:53.053 --> 01:10:56.139
Snake Plissken,
right here in the flesh.

01:10:57.224 --> 01:10:59.267
Your gun.

01:10:59.351 --> 01:11:01.395
Great. Thanks, pal.

01:11:05.607 --> 01:11:09.987
All right, we're in. Strange scene
here. Let me do the talking.

01:11:17.035 --> 01:11:19.371
Hey, Hershe, how you doin'?

01:11:19.454 --> 01:11:22.874
Hang on, guys. This is big.
It's Snake Plissken.

01:11:22.958 --> 01:11:26.545
I brought him to see you, Hershe.
He's got a business proposition.

01:11:26.628 --> 01:11:30.340
- What's in it for me?
- Wait a minute.

01:11:33.135 --> 01:11:34.970
I know that voice.

01:11:37.014 --> 01:11:39.933
Yeah... You're Carjack Malone.

01:11:40.017 --> 01:11:42.519
Not any more.

01:11:42.602 --> 01:11:44.980
You two know each other?

01:11:51.653 --> 01:11:56.450
The more things change, the more
they stay the same, huh, Carjack?

01:11:56.533 --> 01:11:59.202
Still packing a gun
between your legs.

01:11:59.286 --> 01:12:01.330
Hold on, honey...

01:12:01.413 --> 01:12:03.498
You bolted on me in Cleveland.

01:12:03.582 --> 01:12:05.250
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?

01:12:05.334 --> 01:12:09.504
With me and Texas Mike O'Shea.
You looked different then, Carjack.

01:12:09.588 --> 01:12:13.133
Get one thing straight.
I'm no longer Carjack Malone.

01:12:13.216 --> 01:12:17.179
I'm Hershe Las Palmas,
the most drop-dead number.

01:12:17.262 --> 01:12:19.890
What the hell happened in Cleveland?

01:12:19.973 --> 01:12:23.101
- I got caught and you didn't!
- Don't lie to me!

01:12:23.185 --> 01:12:27.522
So I made another deal! I've
been here five years, not you!

01:12:27.606 --> 01:12:31.193
I got a new deal.
You help me, you live.

01:12:31.276 --> 01:12:33.320
I wouldn't do that, Snake.

01:12:33.403 --> 01:12:36.281
See, anything happens to me,
and you're dead.

01:12:36.365 --> 01:12:38.950
I'm already dead.

01:12:39.409 --> 01:12:41.912
I see your point. What's the deal?

01:12:41.995 --> 01:12:44.539
Get me to Cuervo Jones.
I got one hour.

01:12:44.623 --> 01:12:46.458
Dream on, blue eye.

01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:48.418
Say good night, Carjack.

01:12:48.502 --> 01:12:52.923
Cuervo's got firepower.
No one gets near him.

01:12:53.006 --> 01:12:55.926
And he's got the black box
and the girl.

01:12:56.009 --> 01:12:59.429
- What black box?
- That shuts down the power.

01:12:59.513 --> 01:13:04.518
Oh, yeah, right! And the Plutoxin
Seven virus kills you in ten hours.

01:13:04.601 --> 01:13:06.561
- What?
- It's bullshit!

01:13:06.645 --> 01:13:09.940
Rumour control. Government
propaganda. Just one more lie.

01:13:10.023 --> 01:13:13.527
It's true. I represented
the guy who invented it.

01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:17.406
Swear to God, Snake.

01:13:17.489 --> 01:13:19.282
What's the deal, gorgeous?

01:13:19.366 --> 01:13:21.535
Get the girl and the box,
and get out.

01:13:21.618 --> 01:13:23.662
All of us?

01:13:25.038 --> 01:13:27.874
- Yeah.
- Me, too?

01:13:27.958 --> 01:13:29.918
Why should we leave?

01:13:30.002 --> 01:13:32.421
I love LA.

01:13:32.504 --> 01:13:34.506
Where we gonna go?

01:13:34.589 --> 01:13:36.550
What's the big payoff?

01:13:36.633 --> 01:13:39.344
A million dollars
for whoever helps me.

01:13:39.428 --> 01:13:43.223
A million greenbacks?
I got ten million the next room.

01:13:43.306 --> 01:13:46.184
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.

01:13:46.268 --> 01:13:49.438
- Come on, Snake.
- Swear to God, Eddie.

01:13:50.522 --> 01:13:52.774
This is bigger than Cleveland.

01:13:52.858 --> 01:13:54.985
It sounds thin to me.

01:13:55.068 --> 01:13:57.904
You want Cuervo to rule the world?

01:13:57.988 --> 01:14:01.408
No. That sucks.
So how do we get out?

01:14:01.867 --> 01:14:04.536
I'll tell you that when we get there.

01:14:04.619 --> 01:14:07.539
Oh, Plissken, man,
you are such a loser!

01:14:07.622 --> 01:14:09.958
Making up shit along the way.

01:14:10.042 --> 01:14:12.586
That's why I left you in Cleveland.

01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:16.757
You're just a chump
like the rest of us. No deal!

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.926
Government chopper. It'll be there.

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:24.514
OK, that's better. How are we
getting there in an hour?

01:14:24.598 --> 01:14:26.641
That's your end.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.938
Edward.

01:14:32.022 --> 01:14:34.941
Best you could do is take the five.

01:14:35.025 --> 01:14:37.944
The shape it's in,
two and a half hours minimum.

01:14:38.028 --> 01:14:40.947
No. Use the air. They're burning.

01:14:41.031 --> 01:14:44.409
The Santa Anas. The night wind.

01:14:44.493 --> 01:14:47.954
- What are you talking about?
- Death from above.

01:15:08.266 --> 01:15:10.519
I don't know about this.

01:15:10.602 --> 01:15:13.105
You don't like it, don't come.

01:15:13.188 --> 01:15:15.482
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?

01:15:15.565 --> 01:15:18.276
My name is Hershe.
Understand, Plissken?

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.445
I got an idea.

01:15:20.529 --> 01:15:22.572
Got any red nail polish?

01:15:22.656 --> 01:15:24.783
- What?
- Come on.

01:15:29.162 --> 01:15:31.873
I expect that back, Eddie.

01:15:37.212 --> 01:15:41.925
There. Looks just like the Sword
of Damocles instruction CD.

01:15:42.009 --> 01:15:44.928
Maybe we can pull a Texas switch.

01:15:45.012 --> 01:15:48.473
- If you get close enough.
- Don't worry.

01:15:49.307 --> 01:15:51.601
The wind's up. Let's go!

01:16:13.832 --> 01:16:14.833
Shut-down - 34 minutes.

01:17:05.634 --> 01:17:08.428
Are you ready for the new world?

01:17:11.973 --> 01:17:14.977
The attack is now under way!

01:17:40.794 --> 01:17:43.964
- What's going on?
- We're fucked!

01:17:54.766 --> 01:17:56.810
You see Plissken anywhere?

01:17:59.313 --> 01:18:01.815
Shut-down - 25 minutes.

01:18:09.364 --> 01:18:12.826
Get my jet ready.
Get it fuelled ready to go.

01:18:15.037 --> 01:18:17.706
You can't run away. It's too late.

01:18:17.789 --> 01:18:20.459
You have to stand and face it down.

01:18:20.542 --> 01:18:22.002
Mr President.

01:18:22.085 --> 01:18:24.546
Commander, we're receiving reports.

01:18:24.629 --> 01:18:27.507
An armada of warships
has departed Cuba,

01:18:27.591 --> 01:18:29.634
ETA, Florida in 45 minutes.

01:18:29.718 --> 01:18:31.762
They're starting the invasion.

01:18:32.637 --> 01:18:34.848
I'm going to my quarters!

01:18:34.931 --> 01:18:36.975
I've got to pray!

01:18:38.018 --> 01:18:41.647
Go with him. Make sure
he doesn't do anything crazy.

01:18:56.370 --> 01:18:59.915
Hey, Eddie, is that
what I think it is?

01:18:59.998 --> 01:19:04.544
Yeah. It kept changing owners.
Finally went bankrupt.

01:19:04.628 --> 01:19:06.672
That thing in Paris killed them.

01:19:06.755 --> 01:19:08.799
We need a diversion.

01:19:14.012 --> 01:19:16.181
Hey, Cuervo! Hey!

01:19:17.933 --> 01:19:20.602
Hey, Cuervo! I made it!

01:19:20.686 --> 01:19:23.522
I made it! Wait for me! Whoa!

01:19:25.065 --> 01:19:27.109
Oh, shit!

01:19:35.033 --> 01:19:37.202
Hey, Cuervo!

01:19:37.285 --> 01:19:39.538
Will you please kill him for me?

01:19:39.621 --> 01:19:43.500
Hey! Hey! I got news!
There's about to be an attack!

01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:47.004
You're about to get hit, man.
It's Plissken.

01:19:49.589 --> 01:19:51.925
You told me you shot him dead.

01:19:52.009 --> 01:19:54.136
Yeah, I thought I did,

01:19:54.219 --> 01:19:57.431
but I found him... sort of... alive.

01:19:57.514 --> 01:19:59.558
Sort of. Where?

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.894
- Oh, Cuervo.
- What?

01:20:02.978 --> 01:20:06.648
- It's so good to see you.
- Where is Plissken?!

01:20:06.732 --> 01:20:10.027
- He's near.
- You're stalling, Eddie.

01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:11.862
Aah! Jeez!

01:20:11.945 --> 01:20:15.449
Talk, gringo,
or I'll rip your balls off.

01:20:15.532 --> 01:20:17.576
Look out behind you!

01:20:34.051 --> 01:20:38.180
You have lied to me
for the very last time.

01:23:28.767 --> 01:23:31.144
Come on, hurry up! Let's go!

01:23:39.528 --> 01:23:42.614
Get inside the chopper.
It's bulletproof.

01:23:47.619 --> 01:23:50.330
I'll take my coat back now, asshole.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:11.184
- Take me back.
- Secure the latch.

01:24:14.313 --> 01:24:16.356
You got the remote. Great.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.567
Yeah. Give me the real one.

01:24:18.650 --> 01:24:20.694
I didn't make a switch.

01:24:20.777 --> 01:24:22.904
Yes, you did. I saw you.

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:26.783
Give me that gun!

01:24:56.021 --> 01:24:59.650
Damn it. Carjack, we're hooked up
on your side.

01:25:30.347 --> 01:25:32.599
I hit him!

01:25:57.624 --> 01:25:59.042
Get back here, Plissken!

01:26:00.836 --> 01:26:02.754
Aircraft entering quadrant four, sir.

01:26:02.838 --> 01:26:06.425
- I'm getting radio contact.
- Boost it.

01:26:06.508 --> 01:26:09.011
Get the antidote ready, assholes!

01:26:09.094 --> 01:26:11.304
Plissken, do you have the box?

01:26:11.388 --> 01:26:14.599
I got the remote control unit
and instruction disk.

01:26:14.683 --> 01:26:16.977
Get the trucks, we're on fire.

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:20.647
Shut-down, two minutes, 27 seconds.

01:26:20.731 --> 01:26:24.484
All emergency vehicles,
proceed to the north perimeter.

01:26:31.241 --> 01:26:33.577
Shit! Shit!

01:26:38.957 --> 01:26:41.209
This is a full alert.

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.423
Where the hell is he going?

01:26:47.007 --> 01:26:49.051
Get ready to jump.

01:26:49.134 --> 01:26:51.928
Head for the tree line and disappear.

01:26:53.472 --> 01:26:54.473
Go.

01:26:54.556 --> 01:26:56.475
Go!

01:27:59.538 --> 01:28:01.498
Oh, thank God almighty!

01:28:01.581 --> 01:28:03.417
Thank God almighty!

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.419
Welcome back, sir.

01:28:05.502 --> 01:28:07.546
Give me the goddam shot.

01:28:15.053 --> 01:28:20.142
Your countdown clock has now
terminated function. Your time is up.

01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:25.105
I told you he was dumb.

01:28:25.188 --> 01:28:27.232
You took the fake, hotshot.

01:28:27.316 --> 01:28:31.236
Plutoxin Seven is a fast,
hard-hitting case of the flu.

01:28:32.446 --> 01:28:34.281
Pretty good.

01:28:34.364 --> 01:28:35.907
Relax, war hero.

01:28:35.991 --> 01:28:40.162
We took you for a little ride,
and you came through.

01:28:40.245 --> 01:28:42.998
Now, give me that unit.

01:28:52.049 --> 01:28:54.092
You want this thing?

01:28:54.509 --> 01:28:56.553
Come and get it.

01:28:58.055 --> 01:29:00.974
- Sir...
- What can he do?

01:29:01.058 --> 01:29:03.810
Let go of me! Quit it!

01:29:11.068 --> 01:29:13.820
You didn't finish the mission, Snake.

01:29:13.904 --> 01:29:17.491
Looks like I'll have
to do it for you.

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.084
Hold it, Mr President.

01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.895
Shit.

01:29:52.067 --> 01:29:54.111
We'll take this one.

01:30:05.163 --> 01:30:07.207
Get her out of here.

01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:09.001
Daddy...

01:30:09.084 --> 01:30:11.545
Take her to the chair.

01:30:18.051 --> 01:30:21.513
For he so loved his country...

01:30:21.596 --> 01:30:25.183
he gave his only seditious child.

01:30:30.022 --> 01:30:32.065
Prepare to broadcast...

01:30:33.066 --> 01:30:35.110
worldwide.

01:30:36.486 --> 01:30:38.530
Worldwide!

01:30:40.073 --> 01:30:44.703
She didn't know that she had it
in her pocket, did she?

01:30:44.786 --> 01:30:49.374
I was wondering what kind of
lame switch you'd try to pull.

01:30:49.458 --> 01:30:51.585
You're becoming very predictable.

01:30:53.670 --> 01:30:55.714
Yeah, I guess so.

01:30:56.506 --> 01:30:58.550
You got a smoke?

01:30:58.633 --> 01:31:01.595
The United States
is a no-smoking nation.

01:31:01.678 --> 01:31:05.974
No smoking, no drinking, no drugs,
no women - unless you're married.

01:31:06.058 --> 01:31:09.561
No guns, no foul language,
no red meat.

01:31:09.645 --> 01:31:11.938
The land of the free.

01:31:15.734 --> 01:31:17.778
I don't need the teleprompter.

01:31:17.861 --> 01:31:21.573
This is the President
of the United States.

01:31:21.657 --> 01:31:26.161
I now demand an immediate
retreat of all forces

01:31:26.244 --> 01:31:28.997
now threatening
this great nation.

01:31:29.081 --> 01:31:32.834
If my demand is not met immediately,

01:31:32.918 --> 01:31:38.340
I will destroy your ability
to function permanently.

01:31:38.423 --> 01:31:42.761
Mr President, the Cuban aggression
remains mobile. ETA, four minutes.

01:31:42.844 --> 01:31:44.388
Four minutes.

01:31:44.471 --> 01:31:49.017
Bring the aiming co-ordinates
for Cuba and Mexico online.

01:31:51.937 --> 01:31:54.731
Cuba - seven, seven, nine.

01:31:54.815 --> 01:31:57.567
Seven... seven...

01:31:57.651 --> 01:31:59.486
nine.

01:32:01.238 --> 01:32:05.534
I now render this final solution.

01:32:07.035 --> 01:32:10.580
Welcome to your own map to the stars.

01:32:10.664 --> 01:32:15.085
The big one wiped out
the entertainment industry in LA,

01:32:15.168 --> 01:32:18.547
but the glamour
of Hollywood is still alive...

01:32:18.630 --> 01:32:20.674
Very funny.

01:32:23.093 --> 01:32:25.470
I hope it was worth it,

01:32:25.554 --> 01:32:28.432
for now you are going to die.

01:32:28.515 --> 01:32:31.143
Everybody does.

01:32:31.226 --> 01:32:33.270
Kill him...

01:32:33.353 --> 01:32:37.024
and bring me the real unit.

01:32:37.107 --> 01:32:40.694
- Sir, we're still broadcasting.
- Good! Let them watch!

01:32:42.029 --> 01:32:43.864
Do it!

01:32:46.241 --> 01:32:47.492
Do it!

01:32:49.036 --> 01:32:50.579
On my command!

01:32:53.248 --> 01:32:54.708
Fire!

01:33:15.479 --> 01:33:18.857
He's not even here! He's a hologram!

01:33:20.609 --> 01:33:22.402
She catches on quick.

01:33:23.612 --> 01:33:27.991
Got to be within a half-mile radius.
Round up every available man.

01:33:28.075 --> 01:33:29.993
Hold it.

01:33:30.077 --> 01:33:33.997
Sir, the enemy is less than
two minutes from our shore.

01:33:34.081 --> 01:33:37.459
What's it to be, Plissken -
us or them?

01:33:39.086 --> 01:33:43.131
Shut down the Third World.
They lose, you win.

01:33:43.215 --> 01:33:45.550
Shut down America...

01:33:45.634 --> 01:33:48.095
you lose, they win.

01:33:48.178 --> 01:33:52.891
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.

01:33:52.975 --> 01:33:55.352
So what are you going to do?

01:33:55.435 --> 01:33:57.396
Disappear.

01:34:07.823 --> 01:34:09.866
He's entered the world code.

01:34:12.661 --> 01:34:14.746
No target code.

01:34:18.417 --> 01:34:21.586
Sir, that will shut down
the entire planet.

01:34:23.797 --> 01:34:27.217
I told you you'd better hope
I didn't make it back.

01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:32.764
You push that button, 500 years'
worth of work will be finished.

01:34:32.848 --> 01:34:37.102
Our technology, our way of life,
our entire history.

01:34:37.185 --> 01:34:40.105
We'll have to start all over again.

01:34:43.317 --> 01:34:46.194
For God's sakes, don't do it, Snake!

01:34:47.654 --> 01:34:49.823
The name's Plissken.

01:35:06.673 --> 01:35:08.342
He did it.

01:35:08.425 --> 01:35:11.011
He shut down the Earth.

01:36:30.215 --> 01:36:31.633
Welcome to the human race.

01:40:36.336 --> 01:40:39.965
