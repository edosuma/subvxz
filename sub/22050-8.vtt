01:31.400 --> 01:33.580
Hi. I have bought tickets for a Christmas
concert in Sagene church next week.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.100
I was thinking you and I could bring mom,
it would mean a lot to her.

01:50.160 --> 01:51.860
It's my thank you
for letting me borrow your shower.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.040
You used our shower?

01:54.400 --> 01:56.120
I used your shower, yeah.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.340
It's not...

01:57.460 --> 01:59.460
The hair products aren't mine.
At least not all of them.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.820
But you're welcome to use some.

02:00.860 --> 02:01.720
Feel free to borrow some shampoo.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.400
Hi! Good morning.

02:06.420 --> 02:07.620
I made us some breakfast.

02:08.940 --> 02:10.860
I hope you're hungry cause
I've made lots of food.

02:13.380 --> 02:15.880
Yeah. Should we get change? For the...

02:16.440 --> 02:17.420
For the..

02:17.920 --> 02:20.480
Should we get change for the yoga? Or?

02:20.960 --> 02:23.320
- Oh! You're doing yoga?
- We're doing yoga?

02:23.420 --> 02:24.420
Eh, Yeah? Yeah!

02:25.140 --> 02:27.220
We do! Oh, that kind of yoga!

02:27.760 --> 02:30.020
Yes! I'd forgotten, we're doing yoga now.

02:30.380 --> 02:31.740
We're doing bathing yoga.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.460
- Bathing yoga?
- At Bisleth bath.

02:34.540 --> 02:35.800
So we have to...

02:36.200 --> 02:37.580
So we have to leave.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.640
Just help yourself to some
cayenne pepper from the freezer.

02:40.740 --> 02:43.360
Or, I mean, from the pantry.
It's in the middle of the fridge...

02:44.780 --> 02:46.320
- So... Bye!
- Bye!

02:46.400 --> 02:47.900
Oh, sorry. Bye!

02:49.320 --> 02:51.160
Hey, I didn't know what you like so I just...

02:51.560 --> 02:52.560
I made everything.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.340
What movie?

02:56.380 --> 02:57.260
Movie?

02:59.200 --> 03:00.240
Taste this.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.100
Is it good?

03:05.320 --> 03:06.420
Mhm.

03:07.340 --> 03:08.660
The secret is

03:09.160 --> 03:10.580
a tablespoon of sour cream.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.860
When I woke up, I...

03:26.040 --> 03:28.120
I thought you'd left.

03:31.220 --> 03:32.080
Hey.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.280
I was just here cooking.

03:36.380 --> 03:37.680
And chatting with your friends.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.200
Does Sonja know where are you?

03:50.420 --> 03:52.060
Fuck Sonja. We're not together anymore.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.080
Well, the last time you said it was over,

04:00.640 --> 04:03.400
you we're making out with her
like two days later.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.380
It's not..

04:05.500 --> 04:07.480
It's not easy for me to not
give a fuck about her, Even.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.580
No, but you've got to understand,
the thing with Sonja is...

04:14.200 --> 04:15.740
that she's controlling.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.800
Sometimes I feel as
she knows me better as myself.

04:22.180 --> 04:23.580
Because everything she says is true.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.140
And...

04:26.580 --> 04:27.880
That's why I'm so freaking tired of it.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.260
I feel as though

04:30.240 --> 04:32.780
she can't feel what I feel

04:33.440 --> 04:34.680
or think, for that matter.

04:38.780 --> 04:39.820
You know?

04:43.320 --> 04:45.240
Only you can feel what you feel.

04:56.540 --> 04:58.000
And I haven't felt anything

04:59.820 --> 05:01.360
quite like this...

05:02.340 --> 05:03.300
Ever.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.220
Neither have I.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.320
This song though.

05:27.820 --> 05:28.820
Huh?

05:30.140 --> 05:31.140
Gabrielle?

05:32.920 --> 05:33.760
Are you kidding?

05:34.080 --> 05:35.100
No?

05:40.300 --> 05:42.540
Jesus Christ, this is like hashtag.
What the fuck.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.240
What?

05:45.020 --> 05:48.520
When you found a man of your dreams,
and it turns out he likes Gabrielle.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.800
Am I the man of your dreams?

05:51.860 --> 05:52.720
Or?

05:53.240 --> 05:54.820
Is it me you were talking about?

05:56.440 --> 05:58.600
- Am I the man of your dreams?
- That's how the hashtag goes, you know...

05:58.760 --> 06:00.800
No! Excuse me.
You said I'm man of your dreams.

06:04.920 --> 06:05.920
Say it again.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.400
Say it again.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.000
You're the man of my dreams.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.520
It's shit!

06:29.100 --> 06:31.120
Seee! You're dancing! You are!

06:31.460 --> 06:32.080
No?!

06:32.160 --> 06:33.400
Come on, then.

06:50.080 --> 06:53.100
"You make me fired up,"

06:53.400 --> 06:56.940
"There's nothing that can cool me down."

06:58.040 --> 07:01.180
"You make everything go up in smoke,"

07:01.400 --> 07:05.000
"There's no one else I'd rather do this with."

07:06.140 --> 07:09.020
"Five fine ladies in the club, we command."

07:09.180 --> 07:12.340
"Turn it all the way up in the skies."

07:41.380 --> 07:44.820
Isak! That's it! Ive been trying
to get a hold of you for days!

07:45.080 --> 07:47.480
I kniow that you're mad at me and probably
think I'm a coward for leaving mom,

07:47.620 --> 07:50.320
but I could not help her. I hope you'll understand
that one day. I'm trying my best.

08:08.060 --> 08:09.720
Fine. I'll come with you
to that Christmas concert.

08:18.060 --> 08:20.220
I'm bringing my new boyfriend.
His name's Even.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.080
I don't know if you're joking right now?

08:49.020 --> 08:51.340
If you've gotten a boyfriend, that's very nice,
Isak, and I would love to meet him.

08:51.460 --> 08:53.780
But you know how mom is,
she gets very easily stressed.

09:06.740 --> 09:07.720
Hey.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.520
Hey.

09:12.540 --> 09:14.100
Forgot to do the assignment?

09:15.440 --> 09:16.420
Yeah.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.800
Did you see that...

09:25.620 --> 09:26.900
That link I sent you?

09:27.600 --> 09:28.820
Uh, no.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.380
What was it?

09:34.460 --> 09:36.680
Just a link to this article.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.880
Okay? What was it about?

09:44.060 --> 09:45.440
Just some...

09:46.920 --> 09:48.860
Research done on

09:51.060 --> 09:52.560
the theory of evolution and

09:55.640 --> 09:57.160
homosexuality.

10:04.540 --> 10:08.580
I was just thinking about
the discussion we had while back.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.600
And...

10:11.800 --> 10:14.360
It's not often that I am wrong, but...

10:15.640 --> 10:17.480
It turns out I was wrong.

10:18.280 --> 10:19.660
In that discussion.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.740
Because...

10:23.500 --> 10:25.240
Homosexuality has had a...

10:27.400 --> 10:29.920
Has played a natural part in the evolution.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.520
And...

10:33.000 --> 10:35.140
They had done a lot of
new and interesting research on it.

10:38.360 --> 10:39.420
So...

10:40.200 --> 10:41.520
I was wrong.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.320
What about...

10:52.660 --> 10:53.720
What about Islam?

10:55.640 --> 10:58.520
Anything new and exciting on that part?

11:00.280 --> 11:01.500
Or is it still the same?

11:06.660 --> 11:07.780
Islam

11:08.380 --> 11:09.880
says the same as always.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.880
That all people in this world
have the same worth.

11:16.140 --> 11:17.440
And that no person

11:19.140 --> 11:22.180
should be spoken about behind their back,

11:22.840 --> 11:26.280
be violated, judged or mocked.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.140
So if you hear anyone use religion

11:31.640 --> 11:33.680
as an argument for their hatred,

11:34.700 --> 11:36.000
don't listen.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.420
Because hate doesn't derive from religion.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.400
It derives from fear.

11:43.860 --> 11:47.780
Can we begin class by everyone turning in
their assignement to my e-mail?

11:51.340 --> 11:52.740
I'm pretty starved.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.840
Me too.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.460
I'm really tired.

11:55.620 --> 11:56.360
I want food.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.680
Are you coming or not?

11:57.780 --> 11:58.720
I am not coming.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.240
Oh, come on!

12:00.320 --> 12:01.500
It's the best pizza, you know that.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.200
Can't you ask somebody to take notes for you?

12:03.380 --> 12:04.380
And just go. 99 crowns for a pizza.

12:04.500 --> 12:05.540
It's that fucking simple.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.260
You guys don't have to ship,
but I'll have to if-

12:07.360 --> 12:08.060
One hour!

12:08.200 --> 12:09.140
Yeah, one hour.

12:09.300 --> 12:10.840
You can study for that fucking test at home.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.540
No! I can't do that.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.400
Yes, you can!

12:13.500 --> 12:15.660
No, you learn more by attending
lectures. Research shows that.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.100
Research?

12:17.460 --> 12:18.600
What did you just say?!

12:18.860 --> 12:20.600
Come on, why are you even thinking about it?

12:21.820 --> 12:23.020
- Hey, guys.
- Hey

12:25.960 --> 12:28.640
Guys, this is Even. Even, this is the...

12:28.780 --> 12:29.240
Yeah.

12:29.360 --> 12:30.460
Hey, guys.

12:30.740 --> 12:31.720
- Hey, Even.
- Hey.

12:31.820 --> 12:32.660
Magnus.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.220
Mahdi, pleasure.

12:35.780 --> 12:36.820
So, what's up?

12:37.340 --> 12:39.840
We were gonna get some food,
but he got one more class, so...

12:39.980 --> 12:40.780
Mhm.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.540
- Sucks.
- I don't fucking care, but he's not interested.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.200
- Oh! You're Even!
- Yeah.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.540
Oh yeah. Holy fucking shit! I thought...

12:47.860 --> 12:49.100
Err, sorry! Hey!

12:49.240 --> 12:50.860
Magnus, pleasure.

12:50.980 --> 12:51.840
A pleasure.

12:52.920 --> 12:53.960
I completely forgotten!

12:54.160 --> 12:55.140
He's the guy who threw us out, right?

12:55.600 --> 12:56.200
It's exactly-

12:56.300 --> 12:56.880
Nah.

12:57.020 --> 12:57.800
No, it was you, but it was...

12:57.920 --> 12:58.780
But because of him.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.620
Yeah, because of you!
You're the one who threw us out.

13:00.740 --> 13:03.100
Because of this hottie. Because...

13:03.220 --> 13:04.480
I didn't throw you out!

13:04.600 --> 13:05.400
Yes, you did.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.620
They we're going to a party.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.520
With you!

13:07.700 --> 13:11.340
It was very sudden. Like,
"Guys, get out! Even's here!"

13:11.480 --> 13:12.900
You were going to a party.

13:13.340 --> 13:14.720
With you.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.100
But then it didn't happen because
you wanted to hang out with him.

13:17.220 --> 13:20.000
Yeah, but I think it was
for the best you weren't there.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.280
No, but seriously guys.
We got to get some food.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.300
Okay, done. We're getting pizza.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.260
Enjoy, guys.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.340
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

13:28.620 --> 13:29.720
You two enjoy as well.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.820
Yeah, we always do.

13:30.940 --> 13:31.720
Bye!

13:32.040 --> 13:32.980
Nice.

13:33.220 --> 13:34.980
- Bye.
- Pizza!

13:39.460 --> 13:40.320
Hello, this is Isak?

13:40.700 --> 13:42.000
Hi. Uh, it's Sonja.

13:43.980 --> 13:44.720
Even's-

13:44.880 --> 13:45.760
It's Sonja.

13:48.540 --> 13:49.600
Don't fucking call Isak.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.660
What? Why did you do that?

13:55.420 --> 13:56.480
Don't talk to her.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.460
Why? What does she want?

14:00.180 --> 14:01.500
She wants to control you.

14:04.040 --> 14:04.960
Control me?

14:05.360 --> 14:06.560
How would she control me?

14:07.580 --> 14:08.540
Because she...

14:08.860 --> 14:11.620
Doesn't like people
who live freely and are real.

14:18.060 --> 14:19.640
You're so fucking hot, Isak!

14:50.020 --> 14:51.540
Hi mom.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.980
I've started dating a boy.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.960
I know you believe in God
and the Bible says it's a sin.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.060
But you don't have to be afraid
because it's also says that

15:57.060 --> 15:59.020
God created man in his image and
that everyone is of equal worth.

16:06.980 --> 16:09.000
I'm sorry if it makes you sad.

16:09.980 --> 16:11.140
Hugs, Isak.

16:31.140 --> 16:32.460
Hey Isak, this is Sonja.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.040
Could you call me when you won't be with Even?

16:34.120 --> 16:35.140
It's important.

16:52.940 --> 16:54.160
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.260
Do you wanna go to my place?

17:03.700 --> 17:05.680
No, I don't want that.

17:07.620 --> 17:09.260
Okay? What do you want to do, then?

17:10.040 --> 17:11.380
I want...

17:12.120 --> 17:14.300
Check in to...

17:14.780 --> 17:16.840
A fucking suite!

17:19.800 --> 17:20.720
A suite?

17:20.840 --> 17:21.800
Yeah?

17:25.360 --> 17:26.600
Why'd you always walk like that?

17:27.560 --> 17:28.300
Huh?

17:56.500 --> 17:57.520
Hello.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.240
We have booked room for a name Evan Bach Næsheim.

18:00.420 --> 18:01.540
Yes, welcome!

18:02.020 --> 18:02.820
Thank you very much.

18:03.140 --> 18:05.140
Can I see some ID?

18:05.360 --> 18:06.400
Of course.

18:07.760 --> 18:08.640
Are you Danish?

18:08.800 --> 18:09.660
Yes, I am.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.780
You're Danish?!

18:11.200 --> 18:12.200
Wow.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.000
How fun, I'm a huge danish fan.

18:15.280 --> 18:15.720
Yeah?

18:15.780 --> 18:18.120
Danish movies, danish people...

18:19.780 --> 18:20.640
Carouselles.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.420
Antichrist.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.040
It's very good.

18:24.220 --> 18:25.040
Brothers.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.300
That one too.

18:26.780 --> 18:28.560
Stars without brains.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.520
Maybe not that one,
but the other ones are very good.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.100
Don't you like Denmark?

18:35.360 --> 18:36.300
Yeah, I do.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.120
Denmark is great.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.620
This is my boyfriend.

18:43.580 --> 18:44.400
How nice.

18:44.920 --> 18:45.960
Yeah, it's very nice.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.520
Isn't he handsome?

18:47.880 --> 18:48.740
Handsome?

18:49.220 --> 18:50.220
Yeah.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.200
How would you say it in Danish, uhm...

18:52.620 --> 18:53.720
Hot?

18:54.560 --> 18:55.540
Hot?

18:55.880 --> 18:57.260
Eh, what do you say?

18:57.640 --> 18:58.920
Isn't this man beautiful?

18:59.340 --> 19:00.380
Yes, very.

19:00.820 --> 19:01.960
Very beautiful.

19:47.380 --> 19:48.300
How many

19:49.040 --> 19:51.660
Isaks and Evens are lying
just like this, what do you think?

20:02.040 --> 20:03.200
Try this burger.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.440
Good?

20:13.900 --> 20:15.760
You know, at our wedding we'll only serve

20:16.280 --> 20:17.420
mini burgers.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.540
At our wedding, really?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.240
You don't think we'll get married?

20:30.740 --> 20:32.200
We're so fucking getting married!

20:33.500 --> 20:35.320
Grand fucking wedding.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.660
And we'll show up as...

20:41.820 --> 20:43.660
God and Julius Caesar.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.380
No, you know what? We'll show up as...

20:49.800 --> 20:50.960
Just completely naked.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.180
Completely naked. No clothes.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.800
From now on, we'll do everything naked.

20:55.700 --> 20:56.400
Okay.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.900
And I'll propose to you from a balcony.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.320
Just imagine me driving up

21:02.560 --> 21:04.420
in a white limo Tesla.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.840
I'll be driving up

21:10.360 --> 21:12.080
and yelling, "Princess Vivian!"

21:17.540 --> 21:18.680
Princess Vivian?

21:20.200 --> 21:21.900
It would be completely genius
if that was your answer!

21:22.560 --> 21:23.640
Because then,

21:24.280 --> 21:27.340
the whole joke is that you think
it's a Romeo and Juliet reference.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.060
But you don't get it
until you enter the balcony

21:31.140 --> 21:33.140
and you see me sitting naked

21:33.360 --> 21:35.500
with a tie. And that's when you get the reference.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.060
And after I've climbed up the balcony,

21:42.240 --> 21:43.400
I'll ask you.

21:44.140 --> 21:46.440
"What'll happen after I save you?"

21:47.800 --> 21:48.900
And then you answer...

21:54.600 --> 21:55.740
"I'll save you right back."

21:58.620 --> 22:00.300
It would be so fucking funny.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.340
It's actually one of my dreams.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.880
It's one of my dreams.

22:10.840 --> 22:11.920
How many

22:12.680 --> 22:14.480
do you think are lying

22:15.400 --> 22:16.680
like this, right now?

22:20.160 --> 22:21.160
Infinite.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.460
In infinite time.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.020
You know, the only way
to have something for infinity,

22:48.940 --> 22:50.160
is by losing it.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.080
Don't say stuff like that

23:09.660 --> 23:10.660
I'm only joking.

24:00.460 --> 24:01.880
Don't you ever sleep?

24:09.820 --> 24:12.300
Not when you're lying here
looking so fucking hot.

24:46.640 --> 24:47.680
Baby!

24:48.380 --> 24:49.640
Come lie down with me.

24:50.340 --> 24:52.240
Yeah, I'll just go buy some

24:52.800 --> 24:54.400
McDonald's first.

25:15.740 --> 25:16.840
Even?!

25:58.880 --> 25:59.960
Where did he go?

26:25.580 --> 26:26.700
Hello, Sonja?

26:28.460 --> 26:30.320
Some-something happened to Even.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.120
Can you check where the closest McDonald's is?

26:41.020 --> 26:44.500
If he's walking around in Grønnland right now,
he'll get beaten up! He's naked!

27:22.040 --> 27:23.140
Okay, thank you.

27:24.320 --> 27:25.380
The police has got him.

27:26.060 --> 27:27.180
So he's safe, at least.

27:30.860 --> 27:31.840
What just happened?

27:34.160 --> 27:35.340
He's manic!

27:36.160 --> 27:37.380
That's what's happening now.

27:41.820 --> 27:43.040
He's not well!

27:48.060 --> 27:49.400
Do you think he's in love with you?

27:51.100 --> 27:52.220
He's not!

27:53.880 --> 27:56.000
It's just a sick idea he has right now.

27:57.100 --> 27:59.520
Last year he memorized the Quoran.
In Arabic!

28:00.180 --> 28:01.540
Because at the time
he thought it was a good idea.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.680
He's also not supposed to smoke,

28:08.580 --> 28:10.500
because that's not good for him,
as you might understand.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.200
So can you just please...

28:14.980 --> 28:16.240
Stay away?!

28:17.305 --> 28:23.179
