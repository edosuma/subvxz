I'm Dying Up Here...

00:06.237 --> 00:09.077
My parents died in a car
crash when I was ten.

00:09.079 --> 00:12.780
You were so brave and honest up there.

00:12.782 --> 00:16.183
Too bad you couldn't have wedged
"funny" in there somewhere.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.752
It's a work in progress.

00:17.754 --> 00:20.187
Hey, I thought what you
did took a lot of balls.

00:20.189 --> 00:22.590
Hey, why don't you save your two
cents for your waitress' tip?

00:22.592 --> 00:24.859
- What did Goldie say?
- She says you're not ready.

00:24.861 --> 00:26.895
How about a shine, my brother?

00:26.897 --> 00:29.030
Are we talking about
your shoes or your dick?

00:30.967 --> 00:33.200
- I'm being serious, Carl.
- My hands are tied.

00:33.202 --> 00:35.602
You are, like, the worst
fucking manager ever.

00:35.604 --> 00:36.970
You know that, right?

00:36.972 --> 00:38.939
You have five seconds to bust my balls

00:38.941 --> 00:42.043
or I'm gonna kick the fuck out
of each and every one of you.

00:42.045 --> 00:45.379
Bill, I'm really sorry... that
you can't return that suit.

00:45.381 --> 00:47.814
Got to love the comedian,
but to be honest,

00:47.816 --> 00:50.250
I was kind of hoping for the girlfriend.

00:50.252 --> 00:52.619
Goldie, why am I here?

00:52.621 --> 00:56.823
I guess it's because you know
when to shut the fuck up.

What did I tell you? This?

03:00.011 --> 03:01.177
Who do you like Saturday?

03:01.179 --> 03:03.011
Riggs? King?

03:04.582 --> 03:05.847
"Battle of the Sexes"?

03:07.885 --> 03:09.685
Can't say I give a shit.

03:09.687 --> 03:10.619
Thanks, Goldie.

03:12.690 --> 03:14.456
<i> So when I turned 19</i>

03:14.458 --> 03:17.426
and still hadn't had sex,

03:17.428 --> 03:19.795
my friends were like, "Hey,
Eddie, come on, man.

03:19.797 --> 03:22.931
For only $15, you can
be worldly like us."

03:24.568 --> 03:27.435
So, after the constant
hounding and peer pressure,

03:27.437 --> 03:28.937
I gave in.

03:28.939 --> 03:31.539
I said that I'd see a prostitute,

03:31.541 --> 03:33.274
but she had to be Jewish.

03:35.212 --> 03:38.045
Now, there are certain things
we Jews don't really excel in.

03:38.047 --> 03:40.381
Professional sports, farming,

03:40.383 --> 03:42.383
and prostitution.

03:42.385 --> 03:44.151
'Cause Jewish women who
have sex for money

03:44.153 --> 03:46.153
were very hard to find
because they all retire

03:46.155 --> 03:47.222
immediately after marriage.

03:50.460 --> 03:53.094
My father said that
when he saw my mother,

03:53.096 --> 03:55.963
he went up to her brother and
asked if his sister was free.

03:55.965 --> 03:57.598
And he said, "No.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.233
But she's reasonable."

04:01.337 --> 04:02.903
All right, thank you, folks.

04:02.905 --> 04:05.806
You've been a slightly
above-average crowd.

04:05.808 --> 04:06.741
Good night.

04:09.411 --> 04:10.810
Whoo!

04:10.812 --> 04:12.346
Keep it going for Eddie Zeidel!

04:12.348 --> 04:13.880
Good.

04:22.291 --> 04:24.590
So funny.

04:24.592 --> 04:28.261
Yeah, Goldie thinks
he's the next Carlin.

04:28.263 --> 04:29.829
I can see that.

04:29.831 --> 04:31.097
Mm-hmm.

04:45.846 --> 04:49.214
- Sweetheart.
- Sid.

04:51.218 --> 04:53.786
Can't stop counting your money
for a sec to say hello?

04:53.788 --> 04:56.689
What do you want, Sid?

04:56.691 --> 05:01.660
Hey, ever notice how open Mic
gives the place a certain tang?

05:01.662 --> 05:03.796
Different kind of sweat, I guess.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I need a favor.

05:08.002 --> 05:09.802
I need your stage Friday night.

05:09.804 --> 05:11.569
Fifteen minutes. That's it.

05:15.642 --> 05:16.874
You heard from Mandy?

05:16.876 --> 05:18.376
Huh?

05:18.378 --> 05:19.544
Oh. Yeah, once.

05:19.546 --> 05:21.913
She, uh, wanted to borrow 100 bucks.

05:21.915 --> 05:23.848
And?

05:23.850 --> 05:25.583
Picked a bad time.

05:25.585 --> 05:30.154
You?

05:30.156 --> 05:31.722
A few calls. Someone's there,

05:31.724 --> 05:33.257
and then they hang up.

05:33.259 --> 05:34.491
It could be her.

05:35.929 --> 05:39.096
She'll find her way. Hell, we did.

05:39.098 --> 05:41.232
Little late for a comeback, isn't it?

05:41.234 --> 05:43.434
Jack Paar was a long time ago.

05:43.436 --> 05:46.537
I just need a place to get seen.

05:46.539 --> 05:49.039
My manager thinks he can get me <i> Merv.</i>

05:49.041 --> 05:52.008
What about King Theodore's
or the Troubadour?

05:52.010 --> 05:54.010
Why would I go to those
second-rate haunts

05:54.012 --> 05:56.347
when you got the hottest
joint on the strip?

05:56.349 --> 05:58.181
That's all hacks and rock 'n' roll.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.050
This is where the comedy's happening.

06:00.052 --> 06:04.454
Look at this fuckin' place,
on a Monday night, no less.

06:04.456 --> 06:07.690
Snapped my fingers. It
just fuckin' happened.

06:07.692 --> 06:09.893
You know, a simple "go fuck
yourself, Sid" would suffice.

06:09.895 --> 06:11.127
For you.

06:14.099 --> 06:16.766
You've come a long way, baby.

06:16.768 --> 06:18.634
Hey.

06:18.636 --> 06:20.302
You remember that, uh...

06:20.304 --> 06:22.104
those shoes with the flapping heels?

06:22.106 --> 06:24.206
Gave you 20 bucks to buy a new pair?

06:24.208 --> 06:25.908
The ones you liked, remember?

06:25.910 --> 06:27.477
- Espa...
- Espadrilles.

06:27.479 --> 06:29.545
Mm-hmm.

06:39.590 --> 06:41.556
Lot of money in those days.

06:50.834 --> 06:52.734
They were 17 bucks.

06:54.170 --> 06:58.039
Extra 3 bucks went to lunch and nylons.

07:01.779 --> 07:03.545
Let me think about it.

07:05.416 --> 07:08.483
Be nice to go to bed and not
stare at the ceiling at night,

07:08.485 --> 07:09.717
you know?

07:12.655 --> 07:15.356
Just think fast, okay?

07:15.358 --> 07:17.792
A time traveler
walked into a bar.

07:17.794 --> 07:19.260
The bartender said,

07:19.262 --> 07:22.763
"We don't serve time travelers here."

07:22.765 --> 07:25.933
So, a time traveler walked into a bar.

07:25.935 --> 07:28.502
You're funny.

07:28.504 --> 07:30.471
Oh, thanks.

07:30.473 --> 07:31.772
Toni Luddy.

07:31.774 --> 07:33.307
Hi. Eddie Zeidel.

07:33.309 --> 07:35.108
Ron Shack. Hi, did you catch my set?

07:35.110 --> 07:36.143
Oh, no, sorry.

07:36.145 --> 07:37.545
I just got here.

07:37.547 --> 07:40.113
I think making people laugh is a gift.

07:40.115 --> 07:41.449
Oh, you'd love my act, then.

07:41.451 --> 07:42.816
I'm practically Santa Claus up there.

07:42.818 --> 07:44.318
Like healing people.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.519
I do this bit about how
old people are always

07:46.521 --> 07:48.555
ordering fish in restaurants.

07:48.557 --> 07:52.025
Or giving incredible blowjobs.

07:52.027 --> 07:54.294
That's pretty much my whole act.

07:54.296 --> 07:56.563
You've been... it was nice to meet...

07:57.732 --> 08:00.232
I'm sorry.

08:00.234 --> 08:02.535
I know that was beyond inappropriate.

08:02.537 --> 08:03.970
If I'm being honest,

08:03.972 --> 08:06.038
I feel like it would be counterintuitive

08:06.040 --> 08:07.841
to agree with you right now.

08:09.711 --> 08:12.144
It's just comics aren't
always great with subtlety,

08:12.146 --> 08:14.347
and I wanted the chance
to talk to you alone.

08:14.349 --> 08:16.349
Right. Right.

08:16.351 --> 08:20.186
Unless you'd rather talk to your friend.

08:20.188 --> 08:21.387
Uh...

08:21.389 --> 08:23.722
No, he's, uh...

08:23.724 --> 08:27.593
I don't really like him that much.

08:27.595 --> 08:30.429
That's some cold shit right there.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.198
Fuck him.

08:35.535 --> 08:36.768
<i> It's like one minute</i>

08:36.770 --> 08:38.003
I'm on the schedule,

08:38.005 --> 08:39.605
and then the next minute I'm off.

08:39.607 --> 08:41.840
You wanted the main stage.
You got the main stage.

08:41.842 --> 08:44.442
Not that you're doing a whole
hell of a lot with it.

08:44.444 --> 08:46.444
Well, it would help if I could get up

08:46.446 --> 08:47.779
before 1:30 in the morning.

08:47.781 --> 08:49.447
I'm sorry. I know that's the drill,

08:49.449 --> 08:51.249
but it's very hard to
know what's working

08:51.251 --> 08:53.084
when there's only ten
people in the house.

08:53.086 --> 08:55.186
Listen. I've been thinking
about doing a ladies night,

08:55.188 --> 08:56.087
in the Cellar.

08:56.089 --> 08:57.855
Just female comics.

08:57.857 --> 09:00.258
Give 'em a place of their own.
Work out their stuff.

09:00.260 --> 09:01.926
That sounds like two steps backwards.

09:01.928 --> 09:04.595
Beats ten steps backwards
out into the parking lot.

09:04.597 --> 09:07.031
Look, sweetie, how many
times do you think

09:07.033 --> 09:09.433
I'm gonna watch you eat
it on my main stage?

09:09.435 --> 09:10.535
It'll do you good.

09:10.537 --> 09:12.202
You'd never do this to the guys.

09:12.204 --> 09:13.971
Please. My bra was in ashes

09:13.973 --> 09:16.607
while you were still waiting
for the tit fairy to show up,

09:16.609 --> 09:18.409
so don't give me that women's lib spiel.

09:18.411 --> 09:20.745
Honestly. I don't see what your beef is.

09:20.747 --> 09:22.546
You get the time on the main stage

09:22.548 --> 09:23.747
any new comic gets.

09:23.749 --> 09:25.549
I want what every new guy comic gets,

09:25.551 --> 09:28.419
which is a steady schedule
and the occasional weekend.

09:28.421 --> 09:30.220
At least on Friday night, 2 a.m.,

09:30.222 --> 09:31.555
there still is a good crowd.

09:31.557 --> 09:32.822
I tell you what.

09:32.824 --> 09:34.925
You do ladies night in the Cellar,

09:34.927 --> 09:36.593
I'll give you Friday,
midnight, main stage.

09:36.595 --> 09:38.161
Goldie, I don't want to be relegated

09:38.163 --> 09:39.896
to a second-class night of comedy.

09:39.898 --> 09:41.330
Because you belong with the guys.

09:41.332 --> 09:42.498
Yes.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.833
Because you're one of them now.

09:43.835 --> 09:45.435
Yes.

09:45.437 --> 09:47.437
Sweetie, just because
they fart in front of you

09:47.439 --> 09:49.272
doesn't make you one of the boys.

09:49.274 --> 09:52.742
You're just the chick they
don't want to fuck anymore.

09:56.814 --> 09:57.980
<i>Now just four days away</i>

09:57.982 --> 09:59.482
<i>from the so-called</i>

09:59.484 --> 10:01.350
<i>"Battle of the Sexes" tennis match,</i>

10:01.352 --> 10:04.420
<i>wherein five-time Wimbledon
champion Billie Jean King</i>

10:04.422 --> 10:05.955
<i>will play Bobby Riggs,</i>

10:05.957 --> 10:08.524
<i>the 55-year-old self-professed
male chauvinist</i>

10:08.526 --> 10:10.626
<i>and former U.S. junior champion.</i>

10:10.628 --> 10:13.328
<i>But what's at stake here
is potentially the future</i>

10:13.330 --> 10:15.097
<i>of the women's liberation movement.</i>

10:15.099 --> 10:18.333
<i>But if Billie Jean King
can pull off the upset...</i>

10:30.380 --> 10:32.280
- Hello?
<i>-  Yeah. Don't hang up.</i>

10:32.282 --> 10:34.483
Twenty bucks say all your
calls start with that.

10:34.485 --> 10:36.218
What do you want, Teddy?

10:36.220 --> 10:37.852
<i> I just want to
make sure that me and you</i>

10:37.854 --> 10:39.020
<i>are on the same page about something.</i>

10:39.022 --> 10:41.123
I doubt that, but go ahead.

10:41.125 --> 10:45.326
There is talk that the comics
are wanting to get paid.

10:45.328 --> 10:48.195
I don't pay students.

10:48.197 --> 10:50.164
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.799
<i> It's your free
fuckin' finger sandwiches</i>

10:51.801 --> 10:53.567
<i>that probably put the
idea in their heads.</i>

10:53.569 --> 10:55.236
Finger sandwiches?

10:55.238 --> 10:57.138
Oh, is that the inch?

10:57.140 --> 11:00.907
I read once where an avalanche
was caused by a single belch.

11:00.909 --> 11:02.976
Listen, before you slam
down the receiver...

11:02.978 --> 11:06.347
um, your ex-husband was
by here yesterday.

11:06.349 --> 11:08.482
<i>He's looking for a place to go up.</i>

11:08.484 --> 11:12.019
<i>Show some producer on</i>
Merv <i>he's still got it.</i>

11:12.021 --> 11:13.220
Yeah, so?

11:13.222 --> 11:15.356
<i> So I sent him your way.</i>

11:15.358 --> 11:16.890
I thought it was a little strange

11:16.892 --> 11:18.424
he didn't come to you first,

11:18.426 --> 11:20.727
but then I remembered I've met you.

11:23.165 --> 11:25.032
<i>Lighten up, Goldie.</i>

11:25.034 --> 11:27.433
Even fuckin' China
throws us the odd panda

11:27.435 --> 11:28.835
every once in a while.

11:39.714 --> 11:41.514
<i>The male is king. The male is supreme.</i>

11:41.516 --> 11:43.049
<i>I've said it over and over again.</i>

11:43.051 --> 11:44.517
<i>I still feel that way.</i>

11:44.519 --> 11:46.519
<i>Girls play a nice game
of tennis for girls.</i>

11:46.521 --> 11:49.121
<i>But when they get out there
on a court with a man,</i>

11:49.123 --> 11:50.690
<i>even a tired old man at 55,</i>

11:50.692 --> 11:52.624
<i>they're gonna be in big trouble.</i>

11:52.626 --> 11:55.527
<i>I'm gonna go out there and play
the Bobby Riggs style of game.</i>

11:55.529 --> 11:58.297
<i>I know that I'm gonna play
as well as I can play.</i>

12:04.271 --> 12:06.072
Hey! I talked to my manager.

12:06.074 --> 12:07.972
He's bringing the <i> Merv</i>
guy by on Friday night.

12:07.974 --> 12:10.041
What time do you think I could go up?

12:10.043 --> 12:11.310
- I said I'd think about it.
- What's there to think about?

12:11.312 --> 12:12.911
You put me up. I do my 15.

12:12.913 --> 12:14.313
Cue "I've Got a Lovely
Bunch of Coconuts."

12:14.315 --> 12:16.248
I don't think Friday's gonna work out.

12:16.250 --> 12:20.151
What do you mean? Hey,
can you just stop?

12:20.153 --> 12:23.654
I'm sorry.

12:23.656 --> 12:25.123
Christ.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.125
It wasn't all bad, was it, Gold?

12:27.127 --> 12:29.160
Oh, we'll always have the shoes, right?

12:29.162 --> 12:30.895
Took two to tango.

12:32.465 --> 12:34.999
- 10 o'clock Friday.
- Thank you. Thank you.

12:35.001 --> 12:36.768
- And then you are gone.
- You'll never see me again.

12:36.770 --> 12:38.269
You won't even have to
come to my funeral.

12:38.271 --> 12:39.737
Oh, that's a shame.

12:39.739 --> 12:42.673
Hate to miss out on all
that great parking.

12:42.675 --> 12:45.243
Best 20 bucks I ever spent.

13:05.597 --> 13:08.331
Jesus fucking Christ.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.973
I mean, how loud can you be?

13:16.975 --> 13:20.310
That's, like, feedback from her vagina.

13:20.312 --> 13:22.312
It's like Godzilla got
his dick stuck in his...

13:22.314 --> 13:24.314
fucking piece of shit!

13:24.316 --> 13:26.048
Don't talk that way about your mom.

13:26.050 --> 13:29.152
I can't believe Eddie's
with Toni the Tiger.

13:29.154 --> 13:31.687
What's the surprise?
She's a chucklefucker.

13:31.689 --> 13:33.489
She's a what? A chuckle...

13:33.491 --> 13:35.992
Fucker. Groupies who only fuck comics?

13:35.994 --> 13:37.794
Haven't you ever heard
of a chucklefucker?

13:37.796 --> 13:40.062
Sorry, no, this whole "women
fucking comics" concept

13:40.064 --> 13:41.130
is foreign to me.

13:41.132 --> 13:42.999
Toni's notorious.

13:43.001 --> 13:45.001
She's seen more comic dick than
the Hollywood free clinic.

13:45.003 --> 13:46.402
Good one.

13:46.404 --> 13:47.536
That she's a chucklefucker

13:47.538 --> 13:49.137
is not the issue.

13:49.139 --> 13:50.739
It's that she's insane.
That's the issue.

13:50.741 --> 13:52.741
Chucklefuckers are a club staple.

13:52.743 --> 13:54.510
Maggie's a chucklefucker.

13:54.512 --> 13:56.412
- No, I'm not.
- Okay.

13:56.414 --> 13:57.979
In Maggie's defense, I've seen your act.

13:57.981 --> 13:59.581
She's a "slightly
amusing" fucker at best.

13:59.583 --> 14:00.649
Oh, really?

14:00.651 --> 14:01.983
Oh, I think I lost something.

14:01.985 --> 14:03.018
It's... right there.

14:04.688 --> 14:06.654
- Wait. No, no, no. Look.
- Okay. Come on.

14:06.656 --> 14:08.223
You know who he looks like?

14:08.225 --> 14:10.425
Let me guess. Somebody
not very flattering?

14:10.427 --> 14:12.227
You look like if I shaved my nuts

14:12.229 --> 14:14.529
and I left sideburns.

14:14.531 --> 14:15.931
I stand charmingly corrected.

14:15.933 --> 14:18.366
No, no, no. He look like
the illegitimate baby

14:18.368 --> 14:20.668
of the Penguin and Howdy Doody.

14:22.271 --> 14:24.071
You look like a frustrated
driver's ed teacher

14:24.073 --> 14:26.173
who hits his wife when he drinks.

14:26.175 --> 14:28.008
No.

14:28.010 --> 14:29.844
My neighbor.

14:29.846 --> 14:32.246
I didn't think you'd get it
if I just said neighbor.

14:32.248 --> 14:33.781
- I think Sully looks dashing.
- Thank you.

14:33.783 --> 14:35.782
Finally, the truth. There she is.

14:35.784 --> 14:37.684
Oh, my God. New waitress.

14:37.686 --> 14:40.554
Show of hands. Who just
went from zero to wood?

14:40.556 --> 14:42.089
She got that new waitress smell.

14:42.091 --> 14:44.091
Ooh, that body.
I think to be safe,

14:44.093 --> 14:46.093
we should all have both of our hands up.

14:46.095 --> 14:48.963
Uh, guys? There's a lady at the table.

14:48.965 --> 14:50.965
You know, I don't think she can hear us.

14:53.869 --> 14:55.402
At least Bill is being a gentleman.

14:55.404 --> 14:57.471
Shut up, I'm masturbating.

15:00.108 --> 15:03.877
Let's get her over.
Excuse me? Sweetheart?

15:03.879 --> 15:05.945
Drop something
so she bends over.

15:11.753 --> 15:14.020
I was too loud, wasn't I?

15:16.091 --> 15:19.658
It was like being in the
front row of a Who concert.

15:23.164 --> 15:27.500
I like loud. Loud is good.

15:27.502 --> 15:28.667
Hmm.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.393
Do I have a fever?

15:56.130 --> 15:58.430
Huh.

15:58.432 --> 16:01.533
No. A little sweaty, maybe.

16:01.535 --> 16:03.200
Why? Do you feel hot?

16:03.202 --> 16:05.269
Are you sure widdle Toni

16:05.271 --> 16:07.939
doesn't have a widdle fever?

16:10.477 --> 16:12.343
Yeah, I'm sure.

16:12.345 --> 16:16.380
Maybe Eddie should take
Toni's tempweture.

16:19.018 --> 16:22.219
But Eddie
doesn't have a fermometer

16:22.221 --> 16:24.721
to take Toni's tempweture with.

16:28.794 --> 16:32.195
Eddie take baby tempweture now?

16:32.197 --> 16:36.232
Wow. Okay.

16:37.336 --> 16:39.636
Open your mouth and say "aah."

16:39.638 --> 16:40.838
Baby way.

16:42.207 --> 16:43.674
The what way?

16:45.243 --> 16:47.410
Baby way.

16:53.051 --> 16:54.484
Uh...

16:57.655 --> 17:01.557
What if we just assume
that Toni has a tempweture

17:01.559 --> 17:04.694
and give Toni some baby aspwin instead?

17:07.431 --> 17:09.499
Okay. Okay, baby. Okay, baby.

17:09.501 --> 17:11.266
No, no. No, no, no, baby.

17:11.268 --> 17:13.569
Okay, baby! Baby way!

17:13.570 --> 17:18.207
Baby way. Okay.

17:18.209 --> 17:21.276
Hold on, let me get it.

17:44.134 --> 17:46.768
Why would he want a human?

17:46.770 --> 17:48.570
Does that make sense to you?

17:48.572 --> 17:50.304
What?

17:50.306 --> 17:52.774
Like, he's a fucking creature.
Why would he want her?

17:52.776 --> 17:54.575
That'd be like me swimming in a pond,

17:54.577 --> 17:56.377
being like, "Hey, you know what?

17:56.379 --> 17:58.579
I want to fuck fish now."

17:58.581 --> 17:59.947
Seriously, shouldn't he be off, like,

17:59.949 --> 18:01.749
screwing crocodiles or something?

18:04.320 --> 18:06.521
- Where are you going?
- Home.

18:07.723 --> 18:09.623
What just happened?

18:09.625 --> 18:12.059
I'm throwing myself at you, and
you'd rather do five minutes

18:12.061 --> 18:13.827
on an old horror movie than fuck me.

18:13.829 --> 18:15.162
That's what just happened.

18:15.164 --> 18:19.733
Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry.

18:19.735 --> 18:21.134
Some waitress walks by

18:21.136 --> 18:22.836
in a uniform that doesn't show chin,

18:22.838 --> 18:25.072
never mind cleavage, and
you're all off to the races,

18:25.074 --> 18:27.240
but here I am with my tits hanging out,

18:27.242 --> 18:30.343
and you treat me like I'm
fucking selling Amway.

18:30.345 --> 18:31.611
Cass.

18:33.415 --> 18:37.350
I fucked up. I was just
kidding around, okay?

18:37.352 --> 18:40.587
Seriously, I'm sorry. Please stay.

18:45.594 --> 18:46.859
I'm sorry.

18:48.329 --> 18:50.597
Sorry.

18:50.599 --> 18:52.364
It's just we have a place to ourselves

18:52.366 --> 18:54.634
with your dad and
sister in Santa Barbara

18:54.636 --> 18:56.703
and I just

18:56.705 --> 18:58.871
wanted to have a little fun.

19:04.345 --> 19:06.378
You're right.

19:06.380 --> 19:09.648
Why don't you sit and relax?
I'll get us a couple of beers.

19:09.650 --> 19:12.384
We'll turn off the set, and
I can tell you all about

19:12.386 --> 19:14.420
how my penis took gold in Munich.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.156
- Okay.
- Yeah?

19:21.294 --> 19:22.560
Okay.

19:49.055 --> 19:52.489
<i> Okay, this is Ken A.
in the AM.</i>

19:52.491 --> 19:53.858
The baby way?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.359
Wait, what? The what way?

19:55.361 --> 19:57.662
The baby way.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.197
Like how babies have their
temperatures taken.

20:00.199 --> 20:04.068
- The bum.
- Yes.

20:04.070 --> 20:06.170
I'm having a hard time following this

20:06.172 --> 20:08.905
yet am fully invested
in the conversation.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.607
I'm not kidding. I think
she's fuckin' nuts.

20:10.609 --> 20:11.941
What's the big deal?

20:11.943 --> 20:13.177
So she likes to act
like a baby during sex.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.778
Short of a full diaper, I'm game.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.247
- Who does that?
- A chucklefucker.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.582
What?

20:18.584 --> 20:20.684
Okay, so apparently, out here in LA,

20:20.686 --> 20:22.752
there are women who
exclusively fuck comics,

20:22.754 --> 20:27.590
and you, my friend, have got <i> the</i> doozy.

20:27.592 --> 20:28.725
A chucklefucker?

20:28.727 --> 20:30.359
I know.

20:30.361 --> 20:33.029
So, what now?

20:33.031 --> 20:35.565
I mean, she's coming
over for dinner tonight.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.200
Ugh. Dinner? Is that a good idea?

20:37.202 --> 20:38.867
I mean, is she even eating solids yet?

20:38.869 --> 20:40.203
It was the only way I
could get her to leave,

20:40.205 --> 20:42.137
was to promise her dinner.

20:42.139 --> 20:45.474
I guess I could just break
it off after, but...

20:46.578 --> 20:48.477
She's so fuckin' hot.

20:48.479 --> 20:50.946
Aww. Open up
wide for the big aeroplane.

20:50.948 --> 20:52.215
- I won't.
- Come on.

20:52.217 --> 20:53.949
- Stop.
- You got to get big and stwong.

20:53.951 --> 20:55.050
Seriously, stop. Please.

20:55.052 --> 20:56.384
- No. Please.
- Come on.

20:56.386 --> 20:57.753
- Don't. Nope! Nope!
- Hey, hey.

21:11.102 --> 21:12.900
I want to make up for last night.

21:12.902 --> 21:14.068
Good luck with that.

21:14.070 --> 21:15.604
You might be singing a different tune

21:15.606 --> 21:18.240
when I tell you that I got
us into a party tonight

21:18.242 --> 21:19.641
at the Riot House.

21:19.643 --> 21:22.744
Led Zeppelin, Joe Walsh, and us.

21:22.746 --> 21:24.979
It's gonna be fucking huge.

21:24.981 --> 21:27.415
Oh, my God.

21:27.417 --> 21:29.516
Do you forgive me?

21:29.518 --> 21:31.085
Yes.

21:31.087 --> 21:33.487
This is so much better than fucking you.

21:33.489 --> 21:34.989
Anything's better than fucking me.

21:34.991 --> 21:36.190
I know.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.693
Fuckin' brat.

21:57.713 --> 22:01.381
I need to shorten the hem on this.

22:01.383 --> 22:03.150
It's old.

22:03.152 --> 22:04.684
Probably not even worth
the effort, really,

22:04.686 --> 22:07.453
but it's for a party tonight.

22:07.455 --> 22:11.391
I don't even know if it looks
good on me, to be honest.

22:13.028 --> 22:14.560
What's your name?

22:14.562 --> 22:16.163
Cassie.

22:16.165 --> 22:17.897
Cassie, huh?

22:22.404 --> 22:24.671
I'm gonna take this
dress up like you ask,

22:24.673 --> 22:26.739
but we're gonna pinch the waist

22:26.741 --> 22:28.541
just a little,

22:28.543 --> 22:32.178
and you know what's gonna happen
when you walk into that party?

22:32.180 --> 22:34.579
Every man is gonna have a heart attack

22:34.581 --> 22:39.185
when he see such a pretty
girl in this dress.

22:40.254 --> 22:43.022
Yeah, yeah. Come. Come.

22:55.902 --> 22:58.903
I'm like, "Boy, you
better go wash that ass!"

22:58.905 --> 23:01.105
Goddamn!

23:01.107 --> 23:04.108
Don't be walking
around here with no dirty ass!

23:04.110 --> 23:05.777
Ain't no fucking way.

23:05.779 --> 23:08.880
Oh, shit.

23:08.882 --> 23:10.548
Fucker, Willy
Green was his name.

23:10.550 --> 23:12.416
I remember from Peoria.

23:12.418 --> 23:13.852
Goddamn. He was...

23:13.854 --> 23:15.419
Here's one of our up-and-comers.

23:15.421 --> 23:17.088
- Come on, baby.
- Hey, how you doing?

23:17.090 --> 23:19.023
Sorry to bother you, Mr... Mr. Pryor.

23:19.025 --> 23:20.791
Adam Proteau. Nice to meet you.

23:20.793 --> 23:22.260
Goddamn, boy.

23:22.262 --> 23:24.061
You piss in your hand
before offering it?

23:24.063 --> 23:25.262
No, no, no. I didn't...

23:25.264 --> 23:26.597
I didn't... didn't piss my...

23:26.599 --> 23:28.733
This nigga about to pop out his skin.

23:29.902 --> 23:31.769
Hey, I caught your open mike.

23:31.771 --> 23:33.070
Very funny.

23:33.072 --> 23:35.105
- Thank you.
- Should I be worried?

23:35.107 --> 23:36.774
You still got some time.

23:36.776 --> 23:38.442
I'll see you later tonight.

23:38.444 --> 23:40.244
Mm-hmm.

23:40.246 --> 23:41.745
Thanks for the candy, mama.

23:41.747 --> 23:43.847
You be careful with that sweet tooth.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.317
So what you gonna do for six hours?

23:47.319 --> 23:48.785
Visit a local hospital.

23:48.787 --> 23:51.421
Give some inspirational
speeches to some sick kids,

23:51.423 --> 23:53.490
but only the white ones,
because let's face it,

23:53.492 --> 23:55.292
the black ones is fucked.

23:57.396 --> 23:59.262
This nigga built to please.

23:59.264 --> 24:01.664
Well, be sure
that your good works

24:01.666 --> 24:04.333
still get you back
here by 10:00 tonight.

24:06.004 --> 24:08.538
- Watch out for this fool.
- Yeah.

24:11.476 --> 24:12.909
You got someplace to be?

24:13.978 --> 24:15.978
- Nope.
- Good.

24:15.980 --> 24:18.414
Let's go get in some
motherfuckin' trouble.

24:38.836 --> 24:43.839
Whoever he is,
he's not good enough.

24:43.841 --> 24:45.441
You like?

24:48.278 --> 24:49.710
Very much.

24:59.990 --> 25:01.856
I feel so stupid.

25:01.858 --> 25:03.891
Hey.

25:03.893 --> 25:06.994
Hey, hey.

25:06.996 --> 25:09.464
I'm sorry.

25:09.466 --> 25:12.132
Really, it's beautiful.

25:17.474 --> 25:19.306
Come.

25:22.711 --> 25:23.877
Sit.

25:28.684 --> 25:32.086
I know one thing and one thing only.

25:34.256 --> 25:36.222
Beauty.

25:36.224 --> 25:38.592
Yes?

25:38.594 --> 25:40.894
You see?

25:40.896 --> 25:43.062
I see.

25:43.064 --> 25:44.430
I know.

25:53.208 --> 25:56.042
So what made you get into comedy?

25:56.044 --> 25:58.611
You some <i> GQ</i> nigga interviewing me?

25:58.613 --> 26:00.413
"So what made you get
into comedy, Richard?

26:00.415 --> 26:02.882
All the respectable porter jobs taken?"

26:02.884 --> 26:04.417
No, no, no. That's not what I...

26:04.419 --> 26:05.251
I'm just fuckin' with you, man.

26:05.253 --> 26:06.452
Oh.

26:06.454 --> 26:07.286
You need to relax a little, nigga.

26:07.288 --> 26:08.787
Goddamn.

26:11.893 --> 26:13.291
Give me a taste.

26:15.029 --> 26:17.429
Your act, man. Come on, let's hear it.

26:17.431 --> 26:18.263
Like here?

26:18.265 --> 26:19.932
Why not?

26:19.934 --> 26:23.769
Okay. Okay. I'll tell this story

26:23.771 --> 26:26.071
about my dad barbecuing
drunk, all right?

26:26.073 --> 26:28.806
Now, everything that he made
was potentially dangerous.

26:28.808 --> 26:31.076
All right, so.

26:31.078 --> 26:33.278
"Dad, I don't think my chicken's done.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.113
It's really raw in the middle."

26:35.115 --> 26:39.084
"Boy, ain't nobody ever died
from eating raw chicken."

26:39.086 --> 26:41.386
"Dad, people die all the time
from eating raw chicken."

26:41.388 --> 26:43.821
"Well, I'm talking about at this table!

26:43.823 --> 26:46.490
"Why you got to bring the whole
world into your argument?

26:46.492 --> 26:48.626
"Why can't you just graciously lose

26:48.628 --> 26:50.828
"and accept the fact that
can't nobody at this table

26:50.830 --> 26:54.331
say they ever died from
eating my chicken."

26:54.333 --> 26:56.300
"What about Aunt Lily, Dad?"

26:56.302 --> 26:59.736
"Boy, read the damn coroner's report.

26:59.738 --> 27:02.440
"It clearly states that
it was my potato salad

27:02.442 --> 27:05.076
what killed the bitch, not my chicken."

27:07.113 --> 27:08.045
Right on.

27:09.315 --> 27:10.747
Your daddy ever hit you?

27:12.851 --> 27:14.285
You said your daddy drank.

27:14.287 --> 27:16.486
He ever knock you upside
your head after a few?

27:16.488 --> 27:17.821
I mean, yeah, I guess.

27:17.823 --> 27:20.557
"Yeah, I guess." How?

27:23.261 --> 27:26.863
- Strap or the hands...
- Why isn't that in there?

27:26.865 --> 27:29.099
See, that's the silver lining
to your daddy's strap.

27:29.101 --> 27:31.634
Why are you dancing around it?
Own that motherfucker!

27:31.636 --> 27:33.470
Nigga got to be like Ali.

27:34.672 --> 27:36.272
- You know Ali?
- Yeah, yeah...

27:36.274 --> 27:39.109
"Float like a butterfly. Sting
like a motherfucking bee."

27:39.111 --> 27:40.643
See, that's the game, Jack.

27:40.645 --> 27:42.545
This ain't no Bob Hope motherfucker.

27:42.547 --> 27:44.180
- You feel me?
- I Fe... I feel you.

27:44.182 --> 27:48.050
They want that sting,
man, that knockout punch.

27:48.052 --> 27:49.852
They don't want to see a nigga dance.

27:49.854 --> 27:51.286
This ain't some Cotton Club bullshit.

27:51.288 --> 27:53.388
This is motherfuckin' comedy, man.

27:53.390 --> 27:54.957
You got to hit 'em.

27:54.959 --> 27:56.659
Then you hit 'em a-motherfuckin'-gain.

27:56.661 --> 27:58.661
Got to keep hitting until
the motherfucker goes down.

27:58.663 --> 28:02.331
See, my daddy was a boxer,
so I got the moves, man!

28:02.333 --> 28:05.667
- You see this shit right here?
- Yeah, I'm seeing it.

28:05.669 --> 28:07.503
Damn motherfuckin'
straight you seeing it.

28:18.215 --> 28:20.682
Two more, please.

28:24.054 --> 28:25.754
Hey.

28:25.756 --> 28:28.489
You see that old nigga
over there, holding court?

28:28.491 --> 28:29.590
Everybody laughing?

28:29.592 --> 28:31.359
Now, five will get you ten

28:31.361 --> 28:32.894
he's talking about some
bad motherfuckin' shit

28:32.896 --> 28:34.562
happened to him in his life.

28:34.564 --> 28:36.564
He sure as shit ain't
talking about no grandkids

28:36.566 --> 28:38.432
or some raise he got at work.

28:38.434 --> 28:41.435
I mean, he's talking about some
shit almost got him killed, man.

28:41.437 --> 28:42.603
You dig?

28:44.374 --> 28:45.939
The one fell off a year ago.

28:47.877 --> 28:49.443
Well, how can you tell?

28:51.548 --> 28:52.780
Shit.

28:53.849 --> 28:55.515
Nigga, how can you not?

29:03.059 --> 29:05.859
I'm sorry about the other night.

29:05.861 --> 29:07.394
Oh, no. No, no, no.

29:07.396 --> 29:11.864
Why... you don't need to be... that's...

29:11.866 --> 29:15.868
I totally freaked you out.

29:15.870 --> 29:19.539
Okay, well, maybe the
extent of your preparedness

29:19.541 --> 29:20.740
threw me a little.

29:20.742 --> 29:22.542
What? You don't know other women

29:22.544 --> 29:24.777
who carry around a baby
thermometer with them?

29:24.779 --> 29:27.980
I did not see that one coming,
but then again, I'm new to LA.

29:33.088 --> 29:35.487
Your penis felt so good inside of me.

29:40.494 --> 29:41.527
Thank you.

29:49.603 --> 29:51.802
Watch your head.

29:51.804 --> 29:53.504
Oh!

29:53.506 --> 29:57.742
Is it cool if we play some music
while I fuck your brains out?

29:57.744 --> 29:58.676
Yeah.

30:06.986 --> 30:09.286
Oh! I love this album.

31:23.493 --> 31:25.493
All right. Put the lime in the coconut.

31:28.064 --> 31:30.932
Okay.

31:33.704 --> 31:35.503
I said...

31:37.040 --> 31:38.940
I said...

31:40.444 --> 31:41.876
I said...

31:41.878 --> 31:44.178
All right. Hey!

31:55.591 --> 31:57.458
Fuck. Fuck, fuck!

31:59.261 --> 32:00.126
Jesus Christ!

32:00.128 --> 32:01.228
Fucking knock it off!

32:01.230 --> 32:02.396
What the fuck?

32:07.536 --> 32:09.936
Look, I'm sorry.

32:09.938 --> 32:11.739
Can't we just do regular fucking?

32:13.208 --> 32:15.008
Why do I keep doing this?

32:16.078 --> 32:17.177
You okay?

32:19.248 --> 32:22.749
Oh, fuck. I didn't hurt you, did I?

32:22.751 --> 32:23.683
I'm sorry.

32:28.423 --> 32:30.123
What did you expect me to do?

32:30.125 --> 32:32.558
You were fuckin' choking
me with your ankles.

32:32.560 --> 32:37.129
I mean, can't you just... I
don't know, just be normal?

32:37.131 --> 32:39.098
Normal? Like you?

32:39.100 --> 32:40.833
Well, compared to you, yeah!

32:40.835 --> 32:43.969
Standing on a stage telling
a room full of strangers

32:43.971 --> 32:46.572
about all your fucked
up shit, that's normal?

32:46.574 --> 32:49.841
At least I have the balls to be
who I am with the lights on.

32:49.843 --> 32:51.944
All right. This is getting crazy, okay?

32:51.946 --> 32:54.280
I'm really sorry if...

32:54.282 --> 32:56.481
You get up on stage whenever possible,

32:56.483 --> 32:58.951
and you beg for acceptance.

32:58.953 --> 33:01.086
Well, here I am.

33:01.088 --> 33:02.621
You got it.

33:02.623 --> 33:06.658
So why can't I express myself, huh?

33:06.660 --> 33:09.428
How about a little support
for my being who I am?

33:09.430 --> 33:11.496
Yeah, well, you know, when an audience

33:11.498 --> 33:14.433
walks into a club, there's
an understanding.

33:14.435 --> 33:15.867
A pact.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.436
If sticking your dick in my mouth

33:17.438 --> 33:19.137
isn't a pact, then what is?

33:23.776 --> 33:26.177
You know, I hate normal.

33:26.179 --> 33:28.512
It's so small.

33:28.514 --> 33:31.382
I can't get out of bed
for normal anymore.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.317
Hey.

33:37.357 --> 33:39.156
Can I ask you something?

33:41.126 --> 33:42.526
Yeah, sure.

33:42.528 --> 33:47.465
Up there, you're all so
open and vulnerable.

33:50.903 --> 33:53.103
Is it always just bullshit?

34:00.312 --> 34:01.911
It's not supposed to be.

34:06.385 --> 34:09.853
It must be nice to find a place to roar.

34:09.855 --> 34:13.822
Where everyone applauds instead
of making you feel like a freak.

34:40.351 --> 34:41.917
You having a good time?

34:41.918 --> 34:44.719
It's crazy in here, but yes.

34:48.257 --> 34:50.025
Thank you.

34:50.027 --> 34:52.226
You want to meet an albino
that isn't Edgar Winter?

34:52.228 --> 34:53.695
- Yes.
- He's nice.

34:53.697 --> 34:56.097
He reminds me of a
rabbit I had as a kid.

34:56.099 --> 34:58.299
Let me just go find the
ladies room first, okay?

34:58.301 --> 34:59.234
Okay.

35:11.948 --> 35:15.150
Over here...

35:15.152 --> 35:17.451
Turn off the lights.

35:17.453 --> 35:18.586
Oh, my God.

35:18.588 --> 35:21.321
Who did this to you?

35:21.323 --> 35:23.558
Nobody.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.626
Everybody.

35:25.628 --> 35:28.529
Hey. Fuck off.

35:32.936 --> 35:34.468
- Jesus.
- What the fuck are you doing?

35:34.470 --> 35:37.837
How much fucking acid did you take?

35:37.839 --> 35:39.606
Hey, I'm trying to help you.

35:39.608 --> 35:43.077
I don't want your help.

35:43.079 --> 35:46.113
- I want to get fucked.
- What is your damage?

35:46.115 --> 35:48.949
Are you some kind of a band slut?

35:48.951 --> 35:52.085
Not a slut. A sacrifice.

35:52.087 --> 35:54.153
A slut for the greater good.

36:04.432 --> 36:08.033
Did somebody make you do this?

36:08.035 --> 36:10.269
They're vampires, you know?

36:11.473 --> 36:14.740
They need this. Me.

36:16.478 --> 36:20.713
I fill their veins until
who they are melts away

36:20.715 --> 36:23.949
so that what they are shoots
out their fingertips,

36:23.951 --> 36:26.652
and from between their fangs

36:26.654 --> 36:31.590
a tiny drop of me in every fucking song.

36:35.496 --> 36:39.797
You have no idea what
you're doing to yourself.

36:39.799 --> 36:42.367
Yeah, I do.

36:42.369 --> 36:47.139
Same as you. Just louder.

36:47.141 --> 36:50.175
Hey, great. I
can handle two at once.

36:50.177 --> 36:51.643
I'm the drummer.

36:55.015 --> 36:57.414
Then what are you
fuckin' here for, babe?

36:57.416 --> 37:00.351
Bill. Bill.

37:01.821 --> 37:03.354
- What's up?
- I'm leaving.

37:03.356 --> 37:06.557
What? Why? You don't
go on until midnight.

37:06.559 --> 37:08.693
You stay. I need to go.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.467
What the fuck now?

37:19.539 --> 37:22.939
Yeah, so that's why I stopped
wiping my ass, you know?

37:22.941 --> 37:25.209
I don't mind the itch.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.114
If you don't know,
you gonna find that out.

37:31.116 --> 37:34.284
Oh, shit. There he is.

37:34.286 --> 37:36.086
You ready?

37:36.088 --> 37:37.220
A motherfucker was born ready.

37:37.222 --> 37:40.757
Oh. Can I keep him?

37:40.759 --> 37:42.693
Listen, why don't you go to the restroom

37:42.695 --> 37:45.028
and wash yourself up?

37:45.030 --> 37:47.363
- You're up in ten minutes.
- All right.

37:52.036 --> 37:55.905
Richard motherfuckin' Pryor.

37:55.907 --> 37:59.275
You know both our dads used to beat us?

37:59.277 --> 38:03.746
And we both punched out our
science teachers in high school?

38:03.748 --> 38:06.115
What are the motherfucking odds?

38:06.117 --> 38:09.651
- That shit cool, man.
- So you think you know him now.

38:09.653 --> 38:12.554
Hells, yeah. We talked and everything.

38:12.556 --> 38:15.324
Nigga was raised in a brothel and shit.

38:15.326 --> 38:19.261
Hey. Don't say that word.

38:19.263 --> 38:21.830
That's his word, and you ain't him.

38:21.832 --> 38:23.965
And who is you?

38:23.967 --> 38:25.467
All serious and shit

38:25.469 --> 38:29.571
like some type of vulture or somethin'.

38:29.573 --> 38:32.307
Want me to tell you who that man is?

38:32.309 --> 38:35.443
That man is a meteor.

38:35.445 --> 38:37.145
Been floatin' out in space,

38:37.147 --> 38:39.413
and he's been headin'
this way for a long time,

38:39.415 --> 38:41.415
and he's ready now.

38:41.417 --> 38:44.152
He's entered Earth's atmosphere,

38:44.154 --> 38:48.990
but what you're really seeing,
Adam, is pieces of a man,

38:48.992 --> 38:51.126
splintering, breaking off,

38:51.128 --> 38:53.294
leaving a trail that is so bright

38:53.296 --> 38:56.364
that you can't help but stare at it

38:56.366 --> 39:00.501
and want to shield your
eyes at the same time.

39:00.503 --> 39:05.439
Okay, well, I ain't him, so who am I?

39:07.644 --> 39:11.044
One man should never tell
another man who he is.

39:11.046 --> 39:14.681
My manager, Carl, says I can
be the next Flip Wilson

39:14.683 --> 39:17.117
if I'm smart and everything...
that'd be my hook.

39:17.119 --> 39:18.886
Mm.

39:18.888 --> 39:20.988
We already got a Flip Wilson.

39:20.990 --> 39:23.157
Now, why would your manager

39:23.159 --> 39:26.660
say he wants you to be the
next something you ain't?

39:26.662 --> 39:29.962
Do you know why Richard
Pryor is one of a kind?

39:29.964 --> 39:32.732
Because he's not up there telling jokes.

39:32.734 --> 39:34.501
He's talking to ghosts.

39:34.503 --> 39:38.171
And the audience? Just witnesses.

39:38.173 --> 39:41.207
Just like me. Just like you.

39:41.209 --> 39:43.009
Let me ask you a question.

39:43.011 --> 39:46.679
Your manager. He black?

39:46.681 --> 39:50.215
Nope. What, are you saying he should be?

39:50.217 --> 39:53.819
I'm saying your manager should
get you gigs and that's it.

39:53.821 --> 39:56.754
Shouldn't be trying to fit you
into somebody else's box.

39:58.025 --> 39:59.891
Your ghosts, baby.

39:59.893 --> 40:03.161
Your ghosts. That's all you got.

40:10.837 --> 40:13.705
<i>The feminist thing. How
important is that, Billie?</i>

40:13.707 --> 40:15.773
<i>The women's movement is important to me,</i>

40:15.775 --> 40:18.175
<i>as long as it stays practical,</i>

40:18.177 --> 40:20.444
<i>and I think that the women's movement</i>

40:20.446 --> 40:22.179
<i>is really making a better
life for more people,</i>

40:22.181 --> 40:23.948
<i>other than just women,</i>

40:23.950 --> 40:26.750
<i>and I feel very strongly about
it from that point of view.</i>

40:26.752 --> 40:28.685
- Hey, Cass.
- Hey.

40:28.687 --> 40:32.223
<i> What kind of strategy
you might have going into this?</i>

40:32.225 --> 40:33.757
<i> Well, I've
thought long and hard...</i>

40:33.759 --> 40:35.492
You've got to be shitting me.

40:47.639 --> 40:50.073
What took you so long?

40:50.075 --> 40:51.307
Why me?

40:51.309 --> 40:54.310
There's a formidable entrance.

40:54.312 --> 40:55.945
Pryor's going up.

40:55.947 --> 40:59.415
Somebody had to be bumped,
so why not you, huh?

40:59.417 --> 41:01.550
There's plenty of guys going up.

41:01.552 --> 41:02.986
Bump one of them.

41:02.988 --> 41:05.221
It's just me and Boosler out there.

41:05.223 --> 41:07.223
You got bumped because
you're the most bump-able.

41:07.225 --> 41:10.292
It's got nothing to do with
whether you sit or stand.

41:10.294 --> 41:12.728
You've got no idea what I'm
trying to do up there.

41:12.730 --> 41:14.797
It's something I share
with your audience.

41:14.799 --> 41:16.298
Well, the other comics do,

41:16.300 --> 41:17.900
and they think it's pretty
damn groundbreaking.

41:17.902 --> 41:19.902
Oh, you mean the guys? They get you?

41:19.904 --> 41:21.270
They don't get you.

41:21.272 --> 41:22.605
They couldn't, even if they tried.

41:22.607 --> 41:25.007
Yeah, well, they sure as hell seem to.

41:25.009 --> 41:27.009
When I was a kid, there was a carnival.

41:27.011 --> 41:28.610
Guy had a horse,

41:28.612 --> 41:30.612
and he'd say to the
horse, "Count to five,"

41:30.614 --> 41:32.814
and the horse would dig
at the ground five times.

41:32.816 --> 41:35.517
He'd say three. The horse
would dig three times.

41:35.519 --> 41:37.152
Now, between us girls...

41:37.154 --> 41:39.988
you really think that horse could count?

41:39.990 --> 41:41.790
So, about six months ago,

41:41.792 --> 41:43.458
I was peer-pressured

41:43.460 --> 41:46.160
into trying mushrooms for
the first time, all right?

41:46.162 --> 41:48.596
Yeah, and while I was tripping,
all I could think was,

41:48.598 --> 41:51.533
"Damn. White people keep all
the fun shit to themselves."

41:52.869 --> 41:55.269
Can I get a beer?

41:55.271 --> 41:57.238
Just one.

42:02.545 --> 42:04.778
I told one of my
homeboys I did 'shrooms.

42:04.780 --> 42:06.780
He was like, "Yo, why would you do that?

42:06.782 --> 42:08.182
That's white people shit."

42:08.184 --> 42:09.716
I'm like, "Yeah, you know what else

42:09.718 --> 42:10.717
is white people shit?

42:10.719 --> 42:12.453
Not getting shot by the police."

42:15.491 --> 42:18.124
<i> Ruling the world.</i>

42:18.126 --> 42:19.560
You've never seen one before?

42:34.376 --> 42:36.809
How's your love life, Eddie?

42:36.811 --> 42:39.712
Enjoying your sloppy sixtieths?

42:39.714 --> 42:41.814
Lighten up. I'm just fucking with you.

42:41.816 --> 42:44.017
Yeah, no, I get it, Bill.
You're a funny guy.

42:44.019 --> 42:46.686
Not <i> Midnight Special</i> funny, but amusing.

42:48.156 --> 42:50.222
What the fuck did you just say?

42:50.224 --> 42:51.524
Hey, hey, hey, look, look, look.

42:51.526 --> 42:53.526
Before you kick the
shit out of my buddy...

42:53.528 --> 42:54.861
Shut up, you fucking adult baby.

42:54.863 --> 42:56.662
Oh.

42:56.664 --> 42:57.830
Oh, oh, we're giving out nicknames.

42:57.832 --> 42:59.765
- Did you know that?
- Mm-mm.

42:59.767 --> 43:02.001
I didn't know that, I'm
sorry, 'cause in that case,

43:02.003 --> 43:04.203
a perfect one for you would
be ginger-faced cunt.

43:04.205 --> 43:05.837
Oh, is that right, motherfucker?

43:05.839 --> 43:07.373
Yeah. Start monogramming
your fucking towels, Bill.

43:08.342 --> 43:09.875
Just chill.

43:12.613 --> 43:15.914
All right. Thank y'all so much.
That's my time.

43:15.916 --> 43:18.384
Keep it going for your host, Ralph.

43:23.056 --> 43:24.789
Get over here.

43:26.292 --> 43:28.092
You're up after this next comic.

43:28.094 --> 43:31.195
Thanks, Gold. I so appreciate this.

43:31.197 --> 43:33.732
All right, we got a
special guest for y'all.

43:33.734 --> 43:35.266
I mean, a real treat.

43:35.268 --> 43:38.936
You have seen this motherfucker
just about everywhere.

43:38.938 --> 43:40.604
The man needs no introduction.

43:40.606 --> 43:43.641
Give it up for Mr. Richard Pryor!

43:49.249 --> 43:50.181
Pryor?

43:51.251 --> 43:52.917
Pryor's going up?

43:52.919 --> 43:57.421
Do me a favor, Sid. Keep it tight.

43:57.423 --> 43:59.924
Ralph Carnegie,
ladies and gentlemen.

43:59.926 --> 44:03.460
They named a hall after Ralph's pants.

44:03.462 --> 44:05.596
I don't know if y'all know this,

44:05.598 --> 44:06.964
but Ralph is black.

44:06.966 --> 44:09.132
Ralph, you black, right?

44:09.134 --> 44:10.734
Is the Pope a virgin?

44:10.736 --> 44:12.235
Is the Pope a virgin?

44:12.237 --> 44:15.238
How I know? I ain't smelled his dick.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.673
Damn.

44:16.675 --> 44:20.510
I'm sure it smell real pretty.

44:20.512 --> 44:22.312
A lot of pretty white folks in here.

44:22.314 --> 44:24.448
Lot of ugly ones too. Goddamn.

44:24.450 --> 44:26.849
I ain't seen so many white
folks in a long time.

44:26.851 --> 44:28.184
I feel like I'm on auction.

44:28.186 --> 44:29.752
Goldie, what you got me into here?

44:29.754 --> 44:31.253
Hey. You're not going up?

44:31.255 --> 44:32.188
Nope.

44:33.458 --> 44:35.758
That fuckin' sucks.

44:35.760 --> 44:39.462
Well, at least I'm getting
bumped for the best.

44:39.464 --> 44:42.264
Hey, hate to tell you, Cass,

44:42.266 --> 44:44.800
but you're not getting bumped for Pryor.

44:44.802 --> 44:46.935
You're getting bumped
for that sweaty mess.

44:52.042 --> 44:54.276
It's fucking...

44:55.980 --> 44:58.046
Got to put Ralph on auction too.

44:58.048 --> 45:00.149
Except he's gonna cost twice as much

45:00.151 --> 45:02.851
because he's twice as
big and half as black.

45:13.964 --> 45:15.396
Well, that's my time.

45:16.734 --> 45:19.567
What y'all "aww" ing for?

45:19.569 --> 45:23.471
Can't be up here all night.
Nigga got shit to do.

45:23.473 --> 45:25.473
What's the name of the
next dude coming up?

45:25.475 --> 45:26.407
Sid Robbins.

45:26.409 --> 45:27.342
Sid Robb...

45:28.478 --> 45:31.045
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:31.047 --> 45:33.948
this next comic is white.

45:35.652 --> 45:37.852
Three niggas in a row, and
I guess Goldie thought

45:37.854 --> 45:39.186
y'all needed a break from laughing.

45:41.691 --> 45:43.024
I'm just playing.

45:43.026 --> 45:45.359
Ladies and gentlemen, Sid Robbins.

45:50.099 --> 45:52.032
Richard Pryor, ladies and gentlemen!

45:53.435 --> 45:55.602
Keep it going!

46:11.753 --> 46:13.553
So I was reading about
the Supreme Court.

46:13.555 --> 46:15.855
Did you guys see this?

46:15.857 --> 46:17.557
It seems they have established

46:17.559 --> 46:20.727
a narrower definition of pornography.

46:20.729 --> 46:23.696
Local rather than national standards

46:23.698 --> 46:25.198
for what is obscene.

46:25.200 --> 46:28.067
Now, guys, hasn't it always been local?

46:28.069 --> 46:32.605
And when I say local,
I mean our bedrooms?

46:32.607 --> 46:35.774
This doesn't change
anything for us, right?

46:35.776 --> 46:38.411
"I don't care if they do it
in Florida and New Mexico

46:38.413 --> 46:39.579
and Rhode Island.

46:39.581 --> 46:42.380
You want that? You can move!"

46:43.884 --> 46:46.451
My old lady is one piece of work.

46:46.453 --> 46:48.220
Whenever I come home late,

46:48.222 --> 46:51.790
she assumes it's because I
was with another woman.

46:51.792 --> 46:55.460
I say, "Honey. Honey.

46:55.462 --> 46:58.062
You're crazy. It's only you.

46:58.064 --> 47:00.332
And the three women you caught me with."

47:02.936 --> 47:05.770
I got a buddy. He's a Mormon.

47:05.772 --> 47:07.939
Six wives.

47:07.941 --> 47:09.274
In their bible,

47:09.276 --> 47:11.676
it says on the seventh day God rested

47:11.678 --> 47:15.379
and drank plenty of fluids.

47:17.683 --> 47:19.450
Six wives, ladies and gentlemen.

47:19.452 --> 47:23.955
That means six mother-in-laws,
six anniversaries,

47:23.957 --> 47:25.156
and six suicide notes.

47:25.158 --> 47:28.525
No! Make that one suicide note.

47:28.527 --> 47:32.630
"Dear Mary, Carol, Sue,
Linda, Paula, and Allison,

47:32.632 --> 47:34.431
I am writing this suicide note

47:34.433 --> 47:38.835
because I haven't been feeling
very well as of late,

47:38.837 --> 47:41.938
and I don't think I can take it anymore!

47:41.940 --> 47:44.475
I mean, the line to the bathroom alone!"

48:27.718 --> 48:29.852
Thanks very much, guys.
You've been great.

48:57.747 --> 48:59.513
Got to admit.

48:59.515 --> 49:02.083
You got me good, babe.

49:02.085 --> 49:04.452
You wanted your time. You got your time.

49:35.817 --> 49:38.752
You think there's some kind
of poetry to all this?

50:12.152 --> 50:13.751
I admire the
civil rights movement.

50:13.753 --> 50:15.353
I don't know how they did it.

50:15.355 --> 50:18.156
Could you imagine Jews rioting?

50:18.158 --> 50:20.792
Oh, all that fire. The heat.

50:20.794 --> 50:22.259
Throw a couple German
Shepherds in there,

50:22.261 --> 50:25.463
not exactly a thing we gravitate to.

50:25.465 --> 50:28.633
Hey. Hey, Carl.

50:28.635 --> 50:32.503
Yeah. Yeah, it's me, Adam.

50:32.505 --> 50:36.206
Look, you great and all, but we done.

50:37.609 --> 50:39.810
Yeah. Yeah, like,<i> done</i> done.

50:42.148 --> 50:44.848
No. No, you didn't do
anything wrong, I mean,

50:44.850 --> 50:47.551
Carl, you're great, and I owe you a lot,

50:47.553 --> 50:50.487
but we just done, you know?

50:52.992 --> 50:55.124
No, I'm not drunk. I'm... I'm not drunk.

50:55.126 --> 51:00.063
I'm just... I'm just me, man.

51:29.594 --> 51:31.527
