§  

02:50.190 --> 02:53.682
Ah, Mamie. Mamie,
you should be nice to Mr. Lipman.

02:53.793 --> 02:55.818
Why, may I ask?

02:55.929 --> 02:58.955
Ain't you never heard of Lipman
and Davidowitz, men's clothes?

02:59.065 --> 03:01.056
That's the same Lipman!

03:01.167 --> 03:04.898
Where is this?
The old country, huh?

03:05.005 --> 03:07.030
Is this Poland? Is this Russia?

03:08.341 --> 03:10.809
She's a hundred percent right, Joe.

03:10.910 --> 03:14.175
In America, you marry for love

03:15.415 --> 03:17.178
and that's all.

03:17.284 --> 03:20.378
Who said different?

03:20.487 --> 03:22.648
Furthermore,

03:22.756 --> 03:26.954
I got quite a bit saved myself already.

03:27.060 --> 03:29.187
An orphan got to get her own dowry.

03:29.296 --> 03:32.390
Dowry! I thought this
was America.

03:32.499 --> 03:34.296
I don't want no man to say,

03:34.401 --> 03:38.667
"I had to take her just as she was,
without a penny."

03:40.173 --> 03:42.937
So, so where you live?

03:43.043 --> 03:44.476
I board in.

03:44.577 --> 03:46.704
No! Me also!

03:46.813 --> 03:49.077
No!

03:49.182 --> 03:52.948
I sleep in the parlor
with my landlady's two daughters.

03:54.788 --> 03:59.157
I, I got a bed all to myself.

03:59.259 --> 04:01.352
No.

04:01.461 --> 04:04.555
Well, it ain't actual a bed.

04:04.664 --> 04:08.725
It's a...
It's a lounge.

04:08.835 --> 04:11.599
What a bluffer you is, Jake.

04:11.705 --> 04:14.230
You treatin'? Give a look.

04:14.341 --> 04:17.902
What'll it be?

04:18.011 --> 04:20.571
Where's that waiter?

04:20.680 --> 04:25.947
Ladies and gents, meet Schloime Navasky.
Just come over this very day.

04:26.052 --> 04:31.547
Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey!
Sit 'im right down here.

04:31.658 --> 04:33.489
Sit!

04:35.095 --> 04:37.620
Scared to death.
Look at him.

04:37.731 --> 04:42.464
They must have oxen
in steerage these days.

04:42.569 --> 04:45.197
Oh, he's laughing! Look at him!

04:45.305 --> 04:47.830
Waiter, another glass tea.

04:49.876 --> 04:51.673
Oh!

04:54.280 --> 04:56.077
Careful.

04:56.182 --> 05:00.710
Oh! Is that a sight?

05:14.968 --> 05:17.334
Pincus Levinsky.

05:17.437 --> 05:20.372
Oh! I know Charlie Levinsky.

05:20.473 --> 05:22.202
I know a Kaminsky.

05:22.308 --> 05:25.709
I know Sora Gilinsky.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

05:25.812 --> 05:29.873
He will soon learn, in America there is
no such thing as relatives, eh?

05:31.818 --> 05:33.979
Ah, here.

05:35.622 --> 05:38.648
Take two. It's America!

05:51.337 --> 05:53.669
  Huh?

05:53.773 --> 05:59.006
Oh, his hat! Oh!

06:11.891 --> 06:15.088
Hey! Welcome to America!

06:16.496 --> 06:19.693
No, Jake, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

06:19.799 --> 06:21.733
What's the matter?
You got somebody else?

06:21.835 --> 06:23.735
Look who's talking.
Me?

06:23.837 --> 06:27.295
Shh!

06:27.407 --> 06:29.272
What about Fanny?
Fanny?

06:29.375 --> 06:30.899
Shh!

06:31.010 --> 06:33.035
We work in the same shop,
and that's all.

06:33.146 --> 06:34.841
Huh!

06:36.449 --> 06:38.246
Let's go inside.
Let me explain.

06:38.351 --> 06:41.149
No. My landlady.

06:43.957 --> 06:45.788
All right.

06:48.194 --> 06:49.491
Good-bye.

06:49.596 --> 06:52.827
Jake. Wait.

06:52.932 --> 06:54.729
For what?

07:33.773 --> 07:35.968
Poor little orphan.

07:36.075 --> 07:38.066
When you come over?

07:38.177 --> 07:39.940
Seven years.

07:40.046 --> 07:44.813
I come all alone from Poland
when I was 16 years old.

07:46.653 --> 07:49.383
You speak English like a Yankee.
Thank you.

07:49.489 --> 07:52.481
I would think you was born here.

07:53.693 --> 07:56.218
Hey!
Ma?

07:56.329 --> 07:58.263
Over here.

08:11.511 --> 08:15.038
§

08:56.089 --> 09:01.152
Bernstein, what was you
in the old country, huh?

09:01.260 --> 09:03.660
A yeshiva student?

09:03.763 --> 09:07.961
Sit on your tochiss all day
in the study house, huh?

09:08.067 --> 09:11.264
And the women is bringing the food
for the scholar,

09:11.371 --> 09:13.236
and everyone is fighting,

09:13.339 --> 09:17.298
"Stay by my house, stay by me!

09:19.479 --> 09:24.416
And please do me the honor
to marry with my daughter."

09:25.952 --> 09:30.412
Well, I wasn't no boss in Lithuania.

09:30.523 --> 09:32.252
No, sir.

09:32.358 --> 09:34.952
Give a guess what I was.

09:35.061 --> 09:36.824
A peddler.

09:36.929 --> 09:40.262
Ah! I told you already?

09:40.366 --> 09:43.733
Hmph. Some country, America.

09:45.004 --> 09:47.097
The peddler becomes the boss,

09:47.206 --> 09:50.403
and the yishiva bocher
sits by the sewing machine.

09:50.510 --> 09:52.740
Some country, huh, Jake?

09:52.845 --> 09:55.439
You betcha!

09:55.548 --> 09:59.143
This is one of the locusts from Egypt.

09:59.252 --> 10:01.618
Huh? Look at him.

10:01.721 --> 10:04.815
Boss, what time?
Is 12:00 yet?

10:04.924 --> 10:10.453
What if it is? After 12:00,
starts all over again, ain't it?

10:10.563 --> 10:12.394
Half after.

10:23.142 --> 10:25.110
So you will ask, huh?

10:25.211 --> 10:28.612
First thing I get to the house!
Good.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.546
Fanny!

10:32.318 --> 10:35.014
What's the hurry?

10:36.289 --> 10:39.417
You're finished with Fanny, huh?

10:39.525 --> 10:41.789
Why? You want Fanny?

10:41.894 --> 10:45.421
That kind of a woman,
that's not for me.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.096
So what kind of woman is for you?

10:54.474 --> 10:56.305
Bernstein.

10:59.812 --> 11:02.212
So you went to the marriage broker, huh?

11:04.751 --> 11:08.312
§

12:13.152 --> 12:15.279
Mrs. Kavarsky!

12:15.388 --> 12:19.415
A man works in my shop,
and he needs a home. Do you got?

12:19.525 --> 12:22.892
You better be looking yourself,
Mr. Podkovnik.

12:22.995 --> 12:27.398
They took your landlady away
to the hospital.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.594
Her sister come for Feigle already.

12:34.473 --> 12:36.998
Oh, wait, wait.

12:37.109 --> 12:40.101
It come this morning so I keep for you.

12:45.918 --> 12:47.909
Go. Leave me in peace.

12:49.689 --> 12:52.590
What's the matter?

12:54.460 --> 12:56.360
Read it.

13:05.738 --> 13:07.069
Who?

13:08.741 --> 13:11.539
My wife?

13:11.644 --> 13:13.703
My son?

13:13.813 --> 13:16.941
Your father has been freed.

13:17.049 --> 13:19.950
May he have a bright paradise.

14:04.330 --> 14:08.198
Oh, excuse me, missus.

14:08.301 --> 14:10.735
Who is the landlord in this house?

14:10.836 --> 14:13.304
Epstein.

14:13.406 --> 14:15.704
Would you...

14:15.808 --> 14:18.208
Would you tell him Podkovnik
will take the place?

14:18.311 --> 14:22.577
Oh? For what you need
a whole apartment?

14:22.682 --> 14:27.016
Mr. Podkovnik getting married maybe?
It's too much trouble?

14:27.119 --> 14:30.247
Don't get excited.
Right away. I'll tell Epstein.

14:32.024 --> 14:37.052
The furniture, can I keep?

14:37.163 --> 14:41.293
If the sister don't come for it,
I said I would sell it.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.334
But who wants?

14:44.537 --> 14:46.437
I want.

14:48.708 --> 14:52.838
Twenty-five dollars
would be a bargain.

14:54.814 --> 14:56.714
All right, I buy it.

15:01.988 --> 15:05.116
I got you a room.

15:05.224 --> 15:07.454
Huh?

15:07.560 --> 15:10.620
I got you a room. Two dollars a week,
meals and washing included.

15:10.730 --> 15:12.960
Thanks, Jake.
By the neighbor lady?

15:14.300 --> 15:16.461
No, with me.

15:34.153 --> 15:37.554
Well, well, well!

15:37.656 --> 15:41.786
I was thinking
maybe you moved to Chicago?

15:41.894 --> 15:43.862
I, uh...

15:45.698 --> 15:48.223
I've been busy, Mamie.
That's nice.

15:50.703 --> 15:54.264
Don't even bother to clean yourself up
when you call on a girl.

15:55.474 --> 16:00.275
Mamie, I gotta talk to you
about something special.

16:00.379 --> 16:01.869
Oh!

16:09.088 --> 16:10.953
Mamie...

16:16.429 --> 16:21.731
Ah, Mamie, about this money
you got saved.

16:23.602 --> 16:25.467
What about it?

16:26.705 --> 16:29.003
I got a chance for a big bargain.

16:29.108 --> 16:32.100
Oh! What?

16:32.211 --> 16:33.974
Furniture!

16:34.080 --> 16:36.446
What kind of furniture?

16:36.549 --> 16:38.107
What kind?

16:38.217 --> 16:40.777
A stove,

16:40.886 --> 16:44.447
a table, chair, pots, pans.

16:46.325 --> 16:50.853
Mamie, I gotta have my own place.

16:55.601 --> 16:57.569
Jake.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.504
You give?

17:00.606 --> 17:03.074
Jake, you monkey!

17:03.242 --> 17:05.608
I'll pay back every penny.
I swear.

17:05.711 --> 17:08.373
Don't bother yourself.

17:15.788 --> 17:18.279
Eh...

17:18.390 --> 17:20.449
You got in your pocket, maybe?

17:20.559 --> 17:24.119
What?
The money.

17:24.230 --> 17:26.528
Oh, you want it right away?

17:26.632 --> 17:27.929
You betcha!

17:28.032 --> 17:30.627
Come upstairs.

17:30.736 --> 17:32.704
What about your landlady?

17:32.805 --> 17:38.072
Oh, this is a different thing now,
ain't it?

17:42.448 --> 17:47.715
Listen. Better you should get, huh?

17:47.820 --> 17:51.187
Anything you say, Jake.

17:51.290 --> 17:53.554
You're the boss now.

18:14.780 --> 18:18.079
Three years I sleep there.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.584
Now where will you sleep?

18:38.304 --> 18:40.670
For who is the little bed?

18:40.773 --> 18:42.707
My son.

18:42.808 --> 18:45.106
What son is that?

18:45.211 --> 18:47.111
I only got one son.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.773
Jake, what is this?

18:49.882 --> 18:55.184
Did I ever say I was a single man?
Well, did I?

20:18.070 --> 20:19.367
Yankel!

20:25.444 --> 20:26.968
Yankel!

21:04.016 --> 21:06.644
For what purpose
are you bringing this woman in?

21:08.987 --> 21:13.515
For what purpose
are you bringing this woman in?

21:13.625 --> 21:18.392
Uh, for the purpose,
she's my wife.

21:23.268 --> 21:25.964
And that's your son?

21:33.545 --> 21:34.876
Sha!

21:36.315 --> 21:38.909
This woman is my wife and that's all!

21:41.653 --> 21:43.814
Where's the marriage certificate?

22:50.589 --> 22:53.717
This is my missus.

22:55.027 --> 22:57.188
This is Mr. Bernstein.

24:18.977 --> 24:20.877
Gitl.

25:39.758 --> 25:41.658
Yankel.

26:31.977 --> 26:33.638
Yankel.

28:42.340 --> 28:45.969
Look at him.
A little Yankee.

28:46.077 --> 28:48.477
Yankee?

28:48.580 --> 28:52.038
Listen to him!"Yankee."

29:05.163 --> 29:06.994
Joey.

29:08.266 --> 29:10.131
Joey!

29:11.937 --> 29:13.598
Joey.

30:27.712 --> 30:30.704
Come. Come to Papa.

30:36.421 --> 30:39.515

31:06.518 --> 31:08.543
§

31:18.330 --> 31:21.265

31:21.366 --> 31:24.665
Say it, Joey. Horse.

31:27.739 --> 31:29.969
Horse.
Horse?

32:55.360 --> 32:56.850
Jake?

32:58.663 --> 33:00.290
Jake!

33:02.367 --> 33:04.665
Good morning.

33:04.769 --> 33:07.795
What's the matter? You didn't come
to the dancing class for a long time.

33:07.906 --> 33:09.931
The ladies keep asking,
"Where's Jake?"

33:10.041 --> 33:11.872
Horse, Ta'teh.

33:11.976 --> 33:14.501
Horse.
Mister, give him.

33:14.612 --> 33:18.048
Ta'teh?
What else?

33:22.320 --> 33:24.345
Upon my word!

33:24.456 --> 33:26.390
What is wrong, if I may ask?

33:26.491 --> 33:29.983
You got a boy.
That means you got a wife also?

33:30.095 --> 33:32.996
Certainly! Upstairs.

33:33.098 --> 33:35.464
They come yesterday only.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.127
Yankel.

Gitl.

35:47.832 --> 35:49.163
Yossele.

Table.

Bernstein, you want
she should be green always?

36:32.810 --> 36:35.643
Good evening, missus.

36:37.115 --> 36:38.412
Gitl?

36:41.886 --> 36:44.582
Good evening.

36:48.660 --> 36:52.152
Joey! Come. Come on.

36:53.064 --> 36:54.691
Here, sit.

37:15.553 --> 37:20.718
Mmm! By gum, this is good!

37:24.629 --> 37:28.121
This son of mine going to be president
United States. No, Bernstein?

37:28.232 --> 37:32.601
No. The president must be American born.
It's written in the Constitution.

37:42.080 --> 37:47.211
Bernstein, you wish you had a son
like my Joey, huh?

37:48.586 --> 37:51.521
Get married, and you soon will.

37:51.622 --> 37:53.886
How come you so particular?

37:53.991 --> 37:59.224
What you say to the marriage broker,
he can't find you a wife?

37:59.330 --> 38:01.525
Listen, go back again.

38:01.632 --> 38:04.533
Say,"I'll take whatever you got

38:04.635 --> 38:08.765
as long as she got two eyes,
a nose and a mouth."

38:10.108 --> 38:13.009
Look at him, shvitzingl

38:30.762 --> 38:33.196
Come in!
Come in.

38:36.334 --> 38:37.631
Good evening, Jake.

38:40.037 --> 38:42.096
Mamie.

38:51.849 --> 38:55.012
Ah, Miss Fein,

38:55.119 --> 38:56.450
my wife.

39:00.958 --> 39:04.917
How you do?
Pleased to meet you.

39:08.232 --> 39:10.632
Say,"I'm glad to meet you."

39:12.103 --> 39:14.435
She is still a greener.

39:14.539 --> 39:18.839
Never mind.
She'll soon"oysgreen" herself.

39:44.368 --> 39:47.895
What a darling!

39:48.005 --> 39:50.132
What a darling.
What's his name?

39:50.241 --> 39:52.004
Joey.

39:52.109 --> 39:56.944
Joey! Joey, come here. Come here.

39:57.048 --> 40:00.984
Are you a good boy, Joey?

40:01.085 --> 40:02.985
Give me a kiss.

40:03.087 --> 40:07.786
Mmm! Oh, that's nice. So nice.

40:09.260 --> 40:11.922
Here.
Mama.

40:25.610 --> 40:27.441
Mamie.

40:31.015 --> 40:34.781
About the $25.
Huh! I should cough.

40:34.886 --> 40:37.650
A couple of weeks.
No, sir. Now!

40:40.224 --> 40:42.658
I don't know where you get it though.

40:42.760 --> 40:45.991
A married man
with a darling little wife.

40:47.398 --> 40:51.926
I must remember to ask your wife
how she likes the furniture.

40:52.036 --> 40:54.800
The furniture you bought
with my money.

40:54.906 --> 40:58.342
I'll pay you every penny, Mamie.

40:58.442 --> 41:01.377
Just don't say nothing to her, please.

41:01.479 --> 41:04.380
What do I care?
I want my money!

41:04.482 --> 41:07.280
I worked hard enough for it!

41:07.385 --> 41:09.353
I'll say what I like to your wife.

41:12.623 --> 41:16.719
Oh, don't you like it?
Lump it!

41:21.198 --> 41:23.291
Don't talk English.
She will think something.

41:23.401 --> 41:26.598
What do I care what she thinks?

41:26.704 --> 41:28.763
I want she should know.

41:30.875 --> 41:34.834
It's lucky I still remember a word
or two of the old language.

41:36.180 --> 41:38.273
I'll tell her what's what.

41:41.852 --> 41:45.686
Never mind! I don't
wanna stay here anyhow.

41:48.793 --> 41:52.092
Good-bye, Mrs. Podkovnik.

41:52.196 --> 41:54.664
I hope you will enjoy America.

42:06.811 --> 42:09.109
Mamie!

42:15.653 --> 42:20.647
Mamie. Where can I see you?

42:20.758 --> 42:25.024
Well, you can't come by
the dancing academy no more, huh?

42:25.129 --> 42:28.565
Wait a minute. If I want,
I can go there more than I used to.

42:28.666 --> 42:30.861
Mamie.

42:32.069 --> 42:36.233
§

42:46.951 --> 42:48.782
Mmm.

42:59.430 --> 43:02.888
You know where I live, don't you?

43:04.368 --> 43:07.235
Or did you forget?

43:07.338 --> 43:10.774
I don't forget.
What a short mind you got.

43:10.875 --> 43:13.810
I won't forget nothing.
I'll come.

43:13.911 --> 43:17.074
Huh. You're bluffing.

43:17.181 --> 43:19.672
I'll come. I should live so.

43:26.057 --> 43:27.888
All right.

43:29.994 --> 43:32.394
But bring my $25.

43:36.567 --> 43:38.694
Or you'll see.

48:44.708 --> 48:47.677
Come, come.

48:47.778 --> 48:49.245
Come.

49:01.892 --> 49:04.793
You think you're still in Russia?

49:04.895 --> 49:07.090
Love potions!

49:08.499 --> 49:12.765
Look at you. Like a bubbe
with a patch on the head!

49:12.870 --> 49:14.770
Why should he love you?

49:14.872 --> 49:16.772
Fifty times I am telling you,

49:16.874 --> 49:21.038
"Fix yourself. Look like a woman
that lives in America."

49:21.145 --> 49:23.579
I won't be a goyah,
even for Yankel.

49:23.680 --> 49:26.672
What's the use?
I'm talking to the wall.

49:29.386 --> 49:32.082
Why should I bother myself?

49:35.259 --> 49:37.784
What about at night in the bed?

49:37.895 --> 49:41.262
Don't tell me.
I know the answer already. Nothing.

49:47.971 --> 49:51.964
Look at me. Am I a goyah?

49:52.076 --> 49:56.376
I'm as pious as you anyhow.
And I go with my own hair, don't I?

49:56.480 --> 50:00.280
Plenty time for the patch
when I get old.

50:00.384 --> 50:03.080
While I'm young, I'm young.
And that's all.

50:04.955 --> 50:08.220
It can't be helped!

50:08.325 --> 50:13.353
We live in an educated country,
so we dress like educated people.

50:13.464 --> 50:16.399
As they say,"Ladies first."

50:16.500 --> 50:18.934
Hold in. Hold.

50:19.036 --> 50:20.503
It hurts.

50:20.604 --> 50:24.165
It hurts?
That means it's working.

50:28.779 --> 50:31.077
Hold, hold now. Hold. Good.

50:34.918 --> 50:36.647
Oh, yeah!

50:36.753 --> 50:38.778
That right?
Yeah, it's all right.

50:38.889 --> 50:40.254
It's sure tight.

50:40.357 --> 50:42.689
You wanna be an American,
you gotta hurt.

50:46.663 --> 50:48.130
My best!

50:48.232 --> 50:52.760
I don't buy from a pushcart.
I buy inside, by the way. Huh?

50:52.870 --> 50:55.100
How do you like, huh?

50:55.205 --> 50:57.230
Yeah? Yeah?

50:57.341 --> 50:59.536
Maybe you got one with feathers?

50:59.643 --> 51:03.306
You want a hat with feathers?
Feathers, you'll get!

51:15.092 --> 51:17.390
Here.

51:17.494 --> 51:22.557
Oh! Ah, ah, beautiful!

51:22.666 --> 51:25.601
Oh, look. Give a look. Huh?

51:25.702 --> 51:29.399
A regular uptown lady.

51:30.474 --> 51:32.408
Here, like that.

51:32.509 --> 51:34.977
Hmm? You like it?

52:11.715 --> 52:16.209
Evening, missus.
He must work late again.

52:16.320 --> 52:20.654
It's the busy season. The boss
keeps him. And Jake is the best worker.

52:26.029 --> 52:28.122
Yossele.

53:15.245 --> 53:16.678
Base.

53:17.881 --> 53:19.974
Base.

54:30.287 --> 54:32.517
Mamie! Oh, Mamie.

54:32.622 --> 54:35.591
You bring my money?

54:35.692 --> 54:38.320
I gotta speak to you now.
Get away from me!

54:38.428 --> 54:40.760
Please, I come all the way from work!

54:50.207 --> 54:53.870
Is it my fault you got a short mind?

54:53.977 --> 54:55.968
Today is Wednesday.

54:56.079 --> 54:58.047
You was by dancing.

54:58.148 --> 55:02.448
And why not? I'm a single girl.
I can go where I want.

55:02.552 --> 55:04.247
You think I can't?

55:04.354 --> 55:07.846
A married man at a dancing academy
with his little wife draggin' after.

55:07.958 --> 55:11.485
You give me a regular pain!
  Shut up out there!

55:11.595 --> 55:14.257
I don't have nothing to do
with a married man, Jake Podkovnik!

55:14.364 --> 55:18.391
You got my money. You give it!
Otherwise you go to hell!

55:22.472 --> 55:24.906
You go to hell!

55:25.008 --> 55:27.568
You ain't worth my wife's
little finger!

55:27.677 --> 55:29.474
You either!

55:35.752 --> 55:39.051
Oh, you! Don't tell me.

55:41.525 --> 55:43.959
Jake.
Jake.

55:45.162 --> 55:47.289
I'm so busy tonight.

55:50.300 --> 55:52.063
What you waitin' for?

55:57.340 --> 56:00.104
Mr. Bernstein,

56:00.210 --> 56:03.577
why you come to America?

56:03.680 --> 56:07.275
You could've been teacher.

56:07.384 --> 56:10.148
Rabbi even.

56:11.755 --> 56:14.519
I wasn't worthy.

56:14.624 --> 56:17.718
What? I should live so!

56:19.830 --> 56:22.298
I could not take my mind

56:25.068 --> 56:26.535
from profanities.

56:33.343 --> 56:36.369
Here I was studying the Talmud

56:36.480 --> 56:38.812
which teaches

56:38.915 --> 56:43.579
"He who even looks at
the little finger of a woman

56:43.687 --> 56:48.852
is as guilty as though he looked
at a woman totally naked."

56:50.760 --> 56:54.457
So I bought a ship's ticket

56:54.564 --> 56:57.055
and I came to America.

57:43.313 --> 57:44.610
So?

57:55.892 --> 57:57.951
I'm tasting! That's all!

57:58.061 --> 58:00.723
I want a treat,
and you're insulting me.

58:00.830 --> 58:03.321
Who wants your treat?

58:03.433 --> 58:06.994
All right! So don't come
to my wedding neither.

58:12.108 --> 58:13.871
I'll be goddamn!

58:15.779 --> 58:19.476
Jake, was from you
I got the nerve to ask her.

58:19.583 --> 58:23.610
To have a wife,
that's a good thing, huh, Jake?

58:23.720 --> 58:26.188
What you talking, Joe?

58:26.289 --> 58:31.317
A single man is a bum, a gornishtl

58:32.629 --> 58:36.429
One thing, a man gives up something
when he gets married, by the way.

58:36.533 --> 58:39.058
What? Give up what?
Dancing school?

58:39.169 --> 58:41.228
A big mitzeah.

58:41.338 --> 58:43.533
Joe, what is?

58:43.640 --> 58:46.006
When I finish work, and I come home,

58:46.109 --> 58:50.569
all I wanna do is eat my dinner,
enjoy my little wife

58:50.680 --> 58:53.171
and play with my boychick.

58:56.486 --> 59:00.183
Of course, Mamie and me,
we gonna run the academy together.

59:00.290 --> 59:02.349
Be good for business, huh?

59:06.563 --> 59:08.963
Mamie?

59:09.065 --> 59:11.124
Which Mamie?

59:11.234 --> 59:13.134
Mamie Fein.

59:16.706 --> 59:19.174
You asked Mamie Fein, huh?

59:20.577 --> 59:22.374
What she say?

59:24.581 --> 59:26.208
"Maybe."

59:30.086 --> 59:33.419
Maybe, huh? And already
you standing under the canopy.

59:33.523 --> 59:35.286
Upon my word.

59:35.392 --> 59:38.555
It's a good thing she didn't say
more than maybe. You can get away yet.

59:38.662 --> 59:42.325
Get away? I don't wanna get away.

59:44.467 --> 59:47.630
Jake, why should I wanna get away?

59:50.106 --> 59:51.903
Never mind.

01:00:01.651 --> 01:00:06.918
American ladies,
for a good time, yes.

01:00:07.023 --> 01:00:10.083
For a wife, no.

01:00:11.861 --> 01:00:15.024
Get yourself a girl
from the old country.

01:00:15.131 --> 01:00:19.693
She don't ask all the time
for a new dress, a new hat.

01:00:19.803 --> 01:00:22.101
She don't run around
with other mens.

01:00:22.205 --> 01:00:26.665
She keeps the place like a fiddle,
and she knows how to save from a nickel.

01:00:26.776 --> 01:00:31.804
Mamie saved more than $300
from out her wages.

01:00:31.915 --> 01:00:36.011
Furthermore, I don't want
no greenhorn wife.

01:00:37.487 --> 01:00:39.648
Then you go to hell!

01:00:39.756 --> 01:00:43.590
You and Mamie ain't worth
my wife's little finger!

01:00:43.693 --> 01:00:45.957
So.

01:00:46.062 --> 01:00:49.759
If your wife is such a wonder,
how is it you're sittin' here?

01:00:49.866 --> 01:00:52.562
Never mind you business!

01:00:52.669 --> 01:00:55.160
You say one more word about my wife
and I'll give you this!

01:01:07.851 --> 01:01:09.409
You ain't got a cigar?

01:01:09.519 --> 01:01:12.215
Sure I got. Help yourself.
Take a couple.

01:01:12.322 --> 01:01:14.051
Thanks.

01:01:15.925 --> 01:01:18.723
§

01:02:44.514 --> 01:02:47.347
Eat. Make your teeth strong.

01:02:56.292 --> 01:02:59.284
Look what a place is America,
nu, Bernstein?

01:03:00.096 --> 01:03:02.064
At home we had forests.

01:03:02.165 --> 01:03:05.157
  Right outside the door,
remember, Yankel?

01:03:05.268 --> 01:03:09.398
Here one must take a train for an hour
just to be near a tree.

01:03:10.273 --> 01:03:12.332
So go back to Russia.

01:03:15.812 --> 01:03:19.304
Here a Jew is a mensch.

01:03:21.451 --> 01:03:26.548
In Russia we was afraid to walk
within ten feet of a Gentile.

01:03:26.656 --> 01:03:32.424
  Yankel, where in America
is the Gentiles, huh?

01:03:33.463 --> 01:03:36.762
I go with Mrs. Kavarsky,
Rivington Street, Delancey Street,

01:03:36.866 --> 01:03:38.800
everywhere Jews.

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:41.200
The Gentiles keep
in another place, huh?

01:03:45.875 --> 01:03:50.278
Yossele, don't get dirty the knee pants
Ta'teh make for you.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:52.109
Let him enjoy!

01:03:55.852 --> 01:03:58.343
What a boy, with regular knee pants.

01:03:59.322 --> 01:04:01.882
You know what the trouble is
with you, Gitl?

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:06.621
Look on me.

01:04:06.729 --> 01:04:08.890
Give a look on me!

01:04:08.998 --> 01:04:11.466
Am I a Jew or a Gentile?

01:04:11.567 --> 01:04:14.297
Forget that you know me.

01:04:14.404 --> 01:04:17.862
Just by what you see, what do you say?

01:04:18.875 --> 01:04:21.036
A Jew is a Jew.

01:04:22.378 --> 01:04:24.403
What do you know!

01:04:25.381 --> 01:04:28.077
Mr. Bernstein knows many things.

01:04:28.184 --> 01:04:31.745
He going give lessons
in how to talk English.

01:04:31.854 --> 01:04:36.018
I looking for students all the time.
Twenty-five cents an hour.

01:04:36.125 --> 01:04:39.617
I'll be goddamn!

01:04:39.729 --> 01:04:42.664
Who'd wanna take lessons
from such a greeny? Look at him!

01:04:44.767 --> 01:04:47.099
Bernstein,

01:04:48.371 --> 01:04:50.362
you want my advice?

01:04:53.476 --> 01:04:58.971
Go to the shadchen,
say,"I'll take what you got:

01:04:59.082 --> 01:05:03.451
deaf, hunchback,

01:05:03.553 --> 01:05:06.113
long as she got money."

01:05:06.222 --> 01:05:09.658
Then you buy yourself a little store.

01:05:09.759 --> 01:05:11.750
Let the hunchback run the place.

01:05:11.861 --> 01:05:14.227
And you can sit all day
and read the books, huh?

01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:16.594
What do you say?

01:05:17.867 --> 01:05:20.461
Joey!

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:22.435
Joey, come here!

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.182
Don't bother, Mr. Bernstein.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.011
Oh, here he comes, Yossele.

01:07:54.557 --> 01:07:57.219
The slack season already?

01:07:57.326 --> 01:08:00.090
Mister, wait one minute.
Yossele, stay by me.

01:08:00.196 --> 01:08:02.426
Go. I'll send him up in a minute.

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:16.569
Slack season.

01:08:18.014 --> 01:08:21.609
No work three, maybe four months.

01:08:26.822 --> 01:08:28.915
Take off.

01:08:30.126 --> 01:08:31.388
Take off!

01:08:31.493 --> 01:08:33.654
Yankel!

01:08:59.188 --> 01:09:01.087
What happened here?

01:09:02.024 --> 01:09:04.993
She looks like a wet cat!

01:09:09.332 --> 01:09:11.129
Mama!

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:15.728
Take him to my house.
Have a little water.

01:09:19.508 --> 01:09:22.908
Another man would thank God
for such a wife.

01:09:23.011 --> 01:09:25.742
Look how she keeps the place.

01:09:25.848 --> 01:09:27.872
Like a mirror!

01:09:27.984 --> 01:09:30.612
A flower in the window even.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.779
Why do you do this to her?

01:09:32.888 --> 01:09:34.719
What I do?

01:09:39.228 --> 01:09:42.197
With one tochiss,
you can't dance at two weddings.

01:09:45.901 --> 01:09:48.461
You think you're better off
with the dancing girl?

01:09:55.044 --> 01:09:58.207
Gitl told you?
She didn't say a word, I swear.

01:10:00.883 --> 01:10:03.681
Don't get excited!
She didn't say a word!

01:10:03.786 --> 01:10:08.280
I don't care for no dancing girls!

01:10:08.391 --> 01:10:10.188
I don't care for nobody!

01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:14.889
Especially that one,
that shnoosal

01:10:14.997 --> 01:10:18.160
I'm an American fellow.

01:10:18.267 --> 01:10:20.758
A Yankee, that's what I am.
And that's all!

01:10:22.071 --> 01:10:23.868
Oh, it's no use.

01:10:30.846 --> 01:10:34.907
Oh, kinder, kinderl
You have a quarrel and that's all.

01:10:35.017 --> 01:10:38.453
You make a peace.
Give a good kiss.

01:10:38.554 --> 01:10:42.388
What you kicking about anyway?
Mind your own business!

01:10:42.491 --> 01:10:44.049
Listen, Podkovnik,

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:48.995
I was in this country when you were still in
Russia hauling on the bellows!

01:10:49.098 --> 01:10:52.625
You can't pee up my back,
and make me think it's rain.

01:10:52.735 --> 01:10:54.498
Get outta here!

01:10:54.603 --> 01:10:58.403
Never! Never! Go.
Who knows what you do! Maybe kill her.

01:10:58.507 --> 01:11:00.532
You wanna call a policeman? Go.

01:11:00.643 --> 01:11:04.773
Call a policeman! I will tell him
what is doing in this house!

01:11:12.388 --> 01:11:15.357
He will be back, that one.
Don't worry.

01:11:21.597 --> 01:11:23.929
I don't want him back.

01:11:26.936 --> 01:11:28.631
Enough.

01:11:38.447 --> 01:11:40.938
Mamie, how can you fix?

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:44.349
Gitl won't agree to divorce.

01:11:44.453 --> 01:11:46.819
Money. Money, money, money, money.

01:11:47.923 --> 01:11:49.788
I ain't got.

01:11:55.464 --> 01:11:57.159
I got.

01:12:00.302 --> 01:12:02.327
You got?

01:12:02.438 --> 01:12:06.067
You knew I got, didn't you?
Never!

01:12:10.946 --> 01:12:13.141
How much you got?

01:12:15.851 --> 01:12:18.786
Three hundred and forty dollars.

01:12:18.888 --> 01:12:20.981
You little peach, you!

01:12:23.793 --> 01:12:28.890
Used to be 365,
but for the 25 you borrowed,

01:12:28.998 --> 01:12:31.933
I already said Kaddish.

01:12:32.034 --> 01:12:37.563
Ah. We'll keep by enough
to start a dancing academy.

01:12:37.673 --> 01:12:41.666
We're done in the sweatshops.
Finished.

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:49.212
In the first, Podkovnik
will not come home no more

01:12:49.318 --> 01:12:51.980
whether you say yes or no, missus.

01:12:52.087 --> 01:12:54.920
Or as we say,"irregardless."

01:12:57.626 --> 01:13:00.857
You agree to a divorce,

01:13:00.963 --> 01:13:04.899
Miss Mamie Fein is giving you $50.

01:13:13.609 --> 01:13:17.443
You don't agree, no $50.

01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:31.751
All right.

01:13:31.861 --> 01:13:34.659
You got a little one.

01:13:34.763 --> 01:13:36.526
Ach.

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:40.168
Ach.

01:13:40.269 --> 01:13:42.294
What can I do?

01:13:42.404 --> 01:13:45.532
What can I do? What can I do?

01:13:48.244 --> 01:13:50.542
Seventy-five dollars.

01:13:50.646 --> 01:13:55.583
Seventy-five dollars, you'll get
a new husband, one-two-three. Huh?

01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:14.135
What kind business we got here, missus?

01:14:17.273 --> 01:14:21.642
All right, $100.

01:14:21.744 --> 01:14:24.713
One hundred dollars!
What am I saying?

01:14:24.813 --> 01:14:27.441
It's out, I said it, that's all,
it's finished.

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:31.316
One hundred dollars.
You're a rich lady. Mazeltovl

01:14:52.533 --> 01:14:54.558
Mr. Bernstein,

01:14:54.668 --> 01:14:56.863
is all right, these things?

01:14:58.739 --> 01:15:03.802
Mrs. Kavarsky say, for a divorce
a woman must not look like an old broom.

01:15:03.911 --> 01:15:06.471
So I go today by Delan--

01:15:12.386 --> 01:15:14.320
You going away?

01:15:15.489 --> 01:15:17.855
I cannot pay my board.

01:15:17.958 --> 01:15:20.825
So I'll call a policeman.

01:15:22.363 --> 01:15:25.423
You got so much money now.
What do you need a boarder?

01:15:25.533 --> 01:15:28.024
I'm gonna stay by my uncle.

01:15:29.203 --> 01:15:31.000
When?

01:15:34.275 --> 01:15:36.140
Tonight.

01:15:38.145 --> 01:15:40.238
Whatever.

01:15:44.051 --> 01:15:46.212
Missus?

01:15:51.759 --> 01:15:54.353
Maybe you got some string?

01:16:16.684 --> 01:16:18.777
Good-bye.

01:16:23.924 --> 01:16:25.721
Good-bye.

01:16:31.165 --> 01:16:33.360
And good-bye to the boy.

01:16:37.404 --> 01:16:40.669
May you have a boy
of your own one day.

01:16:46.147 --> 01:16:49.480
To have a son,

01:16:49.583 --> 01:16:52.177
a man must have a wife.

01:16:54.088 --> 01:16:56.682
A wife you can get.

01:16:57.925 --> 01:17:00.450
The one that I would ask,

01:17:04.632 --> 01:17:07.192
what if she would say no?

01:17:11.805 --> 01:17:14.501
What if she would say yes?

01:17:22.650 --> 01:17:25.881
Missus, what are you doing?

01:17:25.986 --> 01:17:28.352
I'm saying yes.

01:17:29.523 --> 01:17:31.115
Thank you.

01:17:33.227 --> 01:17:35.092
You're welcome.

01:18:15.769 --> 01:18:17.168
Come in.

01:18:25.212 --> 01:18:27.840
You got the Rabbi's fee?

01:18:29.416 --> 01:18:32.544
All together. No installments.
We gotta eat too.

01:18:32.653 --> 01:18:34.450
I got, I got.

01:18:34.555 --> 01:18:37.456
The witnesses.
You got for them also?

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.627
Zalman?

01:18:43.330 --> 01:18:44.922
My brother.

01:19:07.354 --> 01:19:10.517
What? Come.

01:19:21.869 --> 01:19:23.666
Over there.

01:19:49.697 --> 01:19:51.528
Jake.

01:19:54.201 --> 01:19:55.691
Yankel.

01:19:56.837 --> 01:19:58.668
Yankel.

01:20:02.176 --> 01:20:03.473
Berel.

01:20:04.378 --> 01:20:06.209
Berel.

01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:45.105
Yes.

01:24:01.615 --> 01:24:04.106
Zalman.

01:24:27.074 --> 01:24:29.133
She's a good daughter of Israel, Rabbi.

01:24:29.242 --> 01:24:32.609
She could marry tomorrow,
but she will wait 91 days.

01:24:44.024 --> 01:24:47.357
She's got a suitor?

01:24:47.461 --> 01:24:50.692
Don't worry. When it comes to
the wedding, I'll call your husband.

01:24:50.797 --> 01:24:52.765
He'll make the ceremony.

01:24:52.866 --> 01:24:54.424
Zalman.

01:24:55.802 --> 01:24:59.636
Why she shouldn't have a suitor,
such a beautiful young woman!

01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:01.731
Why she should go to waste?

01:25:01.842 --> 01:25:07.474
A yeshiva bocher,
not a lump of horse like the other one.

01:25:07.581 --> 01:25:10.880
He's already teaching her little one.

01:25:10.984 --> 01:25:14.613
A little one?

01:25:14.721 --> 01:25:17.087
So what's the name, the little one?

01:25:17.190 --> 01:25:20.216
Yossele.
Yossele.

01:25:20.327 --> 01:25:24.991
No. His name is Joey.

01:25:40.447 --> 01:25:43.143
So tomorrow you go by your boss,

01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:48.051
and tell him you'll stay
with the job, huh?

01:25:49.322 --> 01:25:51.290
What about
Podkovnik's Dancing Academy?

01:25:51.391 --> 01:25:53.450
Huh! With what?

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:57.792
Your wife skinned us alive
out of $300, didn't she?

01:25:59.166 --> 01:26:03.899
We'll have to start saving
all over again, from the very beginning.

01:26:11.545 --> 01:26:14.412
Mamie, must we walk
all the way to City Hall?

01:26:14.514 --> 01:26:16.607
Why spend for a carriage?

01:26:16.717 --> 01:26:19.618
But we can go by Third Avenue
and take the El.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.554
Two nickels is two nickels.
It's money, ain't it?

01:26:29.563 --> 01:26:32.999
Are you ashamed
for people to see us?

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:37.799
Mamie! Come on, what you talking, huh?

01:26:46.313 --> 01:26:50.773
This grocery store,
how much rent is he asking?

01:26:50.884 --> 01:26:55.719
Don't bother your head. We got plenty left.
May I fall down on the street.

01:26:57.824 --> 01:27:00.520
You think I can learn
to sell groceries?

01:27:00.627 --> 01:27:03.858
What? You will study.
I will sell.

01:27:09.402 --> 01:27:12.394
Tell me, Mr. Bernstein,
in our store,

01:27:12.506 --> 01:27:15.407
should we sell soda and seltzers?

01:27:15.509 --> 01:27:18.569
In the hot weather, people are thirsty.

01:27:18.678 --> 01:27:22.671
On the other hand, such an item
can be bought on the streets as well.

01:27:22.783 --> 01:27:24.307
That's true.

01:27:24.417 --> 01:27:28.945
  So we mustn't be too quick
to say this or that.
