Hey, Julia, it's Teddy.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.305
My father was murdered.

The person responsible said
that you and Paul were next.

the police.

01:17.344 --> 01:18.712
Surely, Mr. Saint.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.378
Man, she drove up on the curb
and started cussing at Koko.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.380
SKULLY:
Look, man, y'all go.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.415
Come on, Ms. Saint.

18:36.750 --> 18:39.019
Go, man.

18:50.664 --> 18:53.100
Mama, what's wrong?

18:53.100 --> 18:56.570
You said I could come
if I wanted.

18:56.570 --> 18:59.540
Of course. Have a seat.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.480
Just a little...

19:16.623 --> 19:18.458
(Louie groans softly)

19:23.730 --> 19:25.999
How'd you do it?

19:27.534 --> 19:29.570
Do what?

19:29.570 --> 19:32.639
Keep peace in your heart

19:32.639 --> 19:37.477
after your girl
and your baby was killed.

19:39.213 --> 19:41.415
'Cause I know they're not gone.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.521
And I don't want
to taint the love we have.

19:47.521 --> 19:50.057
But ain't...

19:50.057 --> 19:53.560
ain't you so mad, you want
to burn this fucking house down?

19:53.560 --> 19:56.029
Hell yeah.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.265
All the time.

20:01.568 --> 20:04.238
But they won't let me.

20:20.087 --> 20:23.357
(Franklin groaning)

20:23.357 --> 20:25.392
(Veronique grunts)

20:28.562 --> 20:32.432
Franklin. Franklin.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.334
Franklin. Franklin!

20:34.334 --> 20:36.203
- (screaming)
- Wake up. Wake up.

20:36.203 --> 20:38.705
Wake up! Wake up.
Wait, no, no, no, no!

20:38.705 --> 20:41.008
No, no, no, no. It was a dream.
It was a dream. You're dreaming.

20:41.008 --> 20:43.143
- (whimpering)
- You're dreaming, okay?
You're dreaming. Stop.

20:43.143 --> 20:45.179
- Stop, stop, stop. Hey.
- I can't breathe.

20:45.179 --> 20:47.181
Calm down. Come here.

20:47.181 --> 20:49.716
- Aah! I can't fucking breathe!
- You got to calm down, hey.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.718
- Hey, what's happening to you?
- (whimpering)

20:51.718 --> 20:53.320
Has this happened to you before?

20:53.320 --> 20:56.089
- I don't know. One-- once maybe.
- Okay. Okay.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.292
- (groans)
- I'm here. Come here, come here.

20:58.292 --> 21:00.503
You're all right. You're fine.

21:00.503 --> 21:02.905
Listen to me.
You're-you're alive.

21:02.905 --> 21:05.908
You're-you're safe.
You're with me, okay?

21:05.908 --> 21:07.810
- Okay.
- What the fuck is
happening to me?

21:07.810 --> 21:09.912
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

21:09.912 --> 21:11.914
Nothing. There is a plan,

21:11.914 --> 21:13.883
and we're carrying out
that plan.

21:13.883 --> 21:16.652
There's nothing wrong with you,
you hear me? You're fine.

21:16.652 --> 21:18.788
You're fine. You're fine.

21:18.788 --> 21:20.790
(voice breaking):
You're fine.

21:20.790 --> 21:22.091
I'm not fine.

21:22.091 --> 21:25.027
(panting)

21:41.544 --> 21:43.512
(car door closes)

21:45.815 --> 21:47.783
Oh, Egypt.

21:48.784 --> 21:51.620
(both crying)

21:53.789 --> 21:56.959
CANDY:
I got you. I got you.

21:56.959 --> 22:00.629
- I got you. I got you.
- (crying)

22:04.634 --> 22:06.636
(clattering)

22:08.537 --> 22:10.606
(Xiamara sighs heavily)

22:13.109 --> 22:15.478
- It's your turn.
- Oh.

22:16.946 --> 22:18.614
(Xiamara sighs)

22:23.085 --> 22:25.021
(Gustavo groans softly)

22:26.055 --> 22:28.157
(door opens)

23:08.564 --> 23:09.665
Ah.

23:11.567 --> 23:15.004
- What the fuck is this?
- No.

23:16.572 --> 23:18.040
I'm a friend.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.509
A friend with a gun
at my kitchen table?

23:30.219 --> 23:33.055
...we'll need to get away.

24:08.958 --> 24:10.159
Ah.

24:34.950 --> 24:36.752
(mutters)

24:40.189 --> 24:42.992
- (lock clicks)
- (Xiamara sighs)

24:45.227 --> 24:47.463
This is too much.

24:48.230 --> 24:50.499
I know.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.036
Maybe this should be the end...

24:54.036 --> 24:55.471
for us.

25:01.510 --> 25:04.613
Maybe you shouldn't know
where we go.

25:05.581 --> 25:07.616
Yeah, maybe.

25:10.219 --> 25:11.787
(footsteps rapidly retreating)

25:11.787 --> 25:15.091
(sighs)

25:15.091 --> 25:17.159
(sportscaster speaking
indistinctly on radio)

25:20.696 --> 25:24.033
(lock clicks, keys jingle)

25:25.801 --> 25:27.937
Oh, you're here. Dope.

25:27.937 --> 25:30.640
Thank you.
It felt like time.

25:30.640 --> 25:33.643
Yeah. What's all that?

25:33.643 --> 25:36.212
Everything I'm gonna need
for my new place.

25:36.212 --> 25:37.880
You leaving me?

25:37.880 --> 25:40.049
(laughs)
No, Lee.

25:42.852 --> 25:45.187
But I'm leaving the PJs.

25:45.187 --> 25:47.490
Well, goddamn,
we gonna talk about it?

25:47.490 --> 25:51.027
We gonna talk about those guns?

25:51.027 --> 25:54.196
Lee, look.

25:54.196 --> 25:58.734
In a perfect world, I'd be
out of here today, right now.

25:58.734 --> 26:01.504
Head to Ghana with my husband.

26:01.504 --> 26:05.041
We could raise a family there,
a house full of kids.

26:05.041 --> 26:08.210
But instead you sitting here,
getting ready for war?

26:08.210 --> 26:11.180
- Baby, we've been through this.
- We have.

26:11.180 --> 26:14.550
But...

26:14.550 --> 26:16.552
all I see

26:16.552 --> 26:21.190
is us headed to the same grave
Jerome gonna get.

26:22.024 --> 26:26.762
I see it,
and I'm about ready
to change direction.

26:26.762 --> 26:30.499
Look, I just need
to straighten some things out.

26:30.499 --> 26:32.902
Then I can pass the PJs on
to the next man.

26:32.902 --> 26:35.705
I wish I could believe that, Lee.

26:38.808 --> 26:40.509
(kisses)

26:56.826 --> 27:00.696
You remember
Danielle's older brother?

27:00.696 --> 27:02.698
- Ronald?
- Yeah.

27:02.698 --> 27:05.468
Remember he paid us $20
to see how long

27:05.468 --> 27:07.536
- he could strangle us
before we passed out?
- (laughs)

27:07.536 --> 27:12.041
Yeah. I saw you,
and I knew, "Don't do it,"

27:12.041 --> 27:13.909
but it was $20.

27:13.909 --> 27:16.012
(both laugh)

27:19.815 --> 27:22.051
Every time my throat would do
that whistle thing, I...

27:22.051 --> 27:25.788
I'd just flash right back
to that.

27:25.788 --> 27:28.791
- Right.
- And then it just...

27:28.791 --> 27:31.661
and then it just got
more and more.

27:31.661 --> 27:36.532
Like when Keith and 'em
locked us down in the basement

27:36.532 --> 27:38.134
with my Uncle Quick?

27:40.970 --> 27:43.139
Like Lawrence and his brothers.

27:47.109 --> 27:49.612
(voice breaking):
But a thousand times worse.

27:51.580 --> 27:55.484
I did everything
to get myself out of that,

27:55.484 --> 27:57.953
and then, bam,
there I go, right back.

27:57.953 --> 28:01.490
Louie, you know
this wasn't your fault.

28:01.490 --> 28:03.059
It ain't?

28:03.059 --> 28:05.728
How the fuck did I get here?
Again?

28:08.831 --> 28:11.901
(sighs)
Now I lost Jerome.

28:12.935 --> 28:15.004
And the worst part?

28:17.573 --> 28:20.609
I keep forgetting he died.

28:23.579 --> 28:25.614
(pager chiming, buzzing)

28:30.987 --> 28:33.622
Yeah...

28:40.062 --> 28:43.499
Oh, this nigga.

28:45.234 --> 28:47.470
(phone ringing)

28:49.572 --> 28:51.741
- Louie?
- What do you want?

28:51.741 --> 28:53.175
Excuse me?

28:53.175 --> 28:54.777
What...

28:54.777 --> 28:57.480
do you want with me?

28:57.480 --> 28:59.515
I've been paging you.

28:59.515 --> 29:01.617
Yeah,
and I haven't called you back,

29:01.617 --> 29:03.619
so that must mean that I'm busy.

29:03.619 --> 29:04.920
Busy or dead.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.622
Busy doing what?

29:06.622 --> 29:08.624
Excuse you, Mr. White Man,

29:08.624 --> 29:10.626
but if I say I'm busy,
it means I'm fucking busy.

29:10.626 --> 29:12.662
This isn't a request.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.770
Louie.

29:20.770 --> 29:22.438
I heard you.

29:23.939 --> 29:25.908
I can meet you

29:25.908 --> 29:30.179
over at that Fosters
parking lot at 3:00.

29:30.179 --> 29:31.814
I need to see you now.

29:31.814 --> 29:33.482
I'll see you then.

29:38.087 --> 29:41.123
- (siren wailing)
- (dogs barking)

29:44.060 --> 29:47.063
I heard you were leaving us.

29:47.063 --> 29:50.066
I think I have to.

29:51.968 --> 29:54.103
I understand.

29:59.909 --> 30:02.878
Well, if you need an apartment,

30:02.878 --> 30:07.183
I'm sure there's one
at one of our buildings.

30:07.183 --> 30:09.051
Uh, for real?

30:09.051 --> 30:10.920
Mm-hmm.

30:10.920 --> 30:13.990
You've already done so much
for me, though, Ms. Saint.

30:14.957 --> 30:17.159
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

30:22.231 --> 30:24.934
What about taking over
my position

30:24.934 --> 30:27.103
at the shelter full-time?

30:31.240 --> 30:33.909
I-I don't know what to say.

30:33.909 --> 30:36.012
Say yes.

30:37.213 --> 30:39.482
You'd be doing me a favor.

30:43.519 --> 30:46.155
I can't be there right now.

30:48.190 --> 30:51.193
I don't think
I'll ever be there again.

30:52.695 --> 30:54.764
Really?

30:56.699 --> 30:58.734
What would you do then?

31:00.836 --> 31:03.839
I mean, like,
when all this is over?

31:15.051 --> 31:16.886
(engine shuts off)

31:18.688 --> 31:20.656
Oso!

31:20.656 --> 31:22.758
What's up, man?

31:25.127 --> 31:27.096
No more waiting, moreno.

31:27.096 --> 31:28.764
We're moving tomorrow.

31:28.764 --> 31:30.533
I need the documents
and the money now.

31:30.533 --> 31:32.168
Well, yeah, I got the money,
but the documents--

31:32.168 --> 31:34.003
they take what they take.

31:38.074 --> 31:39.809
(Gustavo yells)

31:39.809 --> 31:42.678
Oso, what the fuck happened?

31:42.678 --> 31:44.613
(sighing)

31:51.053 --> 31:53.656
I need your help
because the DEA busted me.

31:53.656 --> 31:55.725
What?

31:57.193 --> 31:59.228
They took all my money
and forced me to help them.

31:59.228 --> 32:01.964
Help them with what?

32:01.964 --> 32:05.501
They want Teddy.
Wanted you, too.

32:05.501 --> 32:08.137
Oso, what the fuck, man?!

32:08.137 --> 32:10.039
How long
you been talking to 'em?

32:10.039 --> 32:11.907
They got me just after you left.

32:11.907 --> 32:15.211
They have photos of Louie.

32:15.211 --> 32:19.181
But you're clean, moreno,
I swear.

32:22.852 --> 32:24.820
Jesus fucking Christ.

32:24.820 --> 32:26.922
It's not only them.

32:26.922 --> 32:29.492
You remember that picture
I showed you?

32:29.492 --> 32:31.560
You knew he was KGB, right?

32:31.560 --> 32:34.163
Yeah. What about him?

32:34.163 --> 32:35.931
He came at me, too.

32:35.931 --> 32:38.768
Broke into my house,
threatened my family.

32:42.171 --> 32:46.475
Listen, they want Teddy.

32:47.276 --> 32:50.513
Two days from now, t
hey want
his cocaine in the warehouse.

32:50.513 --> 32:52.515
Oh, yeah?

32:52.515 --> 32:54.116
And Ruben plans
to kill him there?

32:56.519 --> 32:58.487
I don't think so.

32:58.487 --> 33:00.489
He knows about the DEA,

33:00.489 --> 33:04.527
and I guess
he wants them to arrest him.

33:04.527 --> 33:06.529
But the DEA guy--
he's getting frustrated,

33:06.529 --> 33:09.799
and he's about to pull the plug
and take me to jail.

33:09.799 --> 33:11.667
So everybody wants Teddy, huh?

33:11.667 --> 33:15.137
DEA, KGB and me?

33:15.137 --> 33:16.739
Yes.

33:17.773 --> 33:19.909
And I'm
at the fucking crossroad.

33:21.911 --> 33:26.182
So, if you want him,
it needs to happen now, moreno.

33:27.216 --> 33:29.185
Like this.

33:35.958 --> 33:37.760
Fine.

33:38.561 --> 33:41.897
Think I know a way
to buy you
another day with the DEA.

33:41.897 --> 33:46.802
But, Oso, listen to me
very fucking carefully.

33:46.802 --> 33:50.740
I need Teddy, and I need him
right fucking now.

33:54.210 --> 33:56.679
Yeah, I haven't seen him
in days,

33:56.679 --> 33:59.015
since you killed his father.

33:59.782 --> 34:03.185
Motherfucker
's hiding
like a cat hunting a bird.

34:06.222 --> 34:08.624
But lucky for us, I'm that bird.

34:09.659 --> 34:11.494
Teddy's no pinche cat.

34:11.494 --> 34:15.064
He will smell a trap, you know.

34:15.064 --> 34:17.199
Yeah, you're right about that.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.635
You're just gonna have
to make him believe

34:19.635 --> 34:21.704
it was him that set me up.

34:23.806 --> 34:25.841
Right?

34:27.677 --> 34:29.812
(Gustavo sighs heavily)

34:29.812 --> 34:32.181
I'm sorry, moreno.

34:38.254 --> 34:41.023
You did what you had to do.

34:41.791 --> 34:43.926
<i>HA</i>
VEMEYER:
<i>He's definitely losing it.</i>

34:43.926 --> 34:46.829
The kid actually found
his old man and murdered him

34:46.829 --> 34:48.931
while on the phone with Teddy.

34:48.931 --> 34:51.200
The nigger murdered his father?

34:51.200 --> 34:53.936
- Just cut his fucking throat.
- (groans)

34:53.936 --> 34:55.938
Teddy could hear him choking
on his own blood.

34:55.938 --> 34:57.940
Oh, Jesus.

34:57.940 --> 35:00.776
(both sigh)

35:00.776 --> 35:03.879
I like Teddy.

35:03.879 --> 35:06.515
He's no bleeding heart,
and he was a patriot.

35:07.984 --> 35:10.786
Since he's been on this mission,
he's gotten ambitious.

35:10.786 --> 35:13.489
- The money he stole
could be useful.
- Yeah.

35:13.489 --> 35:14.924
And the business
still has potential.

35:14.924 --> 35:16.192
