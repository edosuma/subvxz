00:08.762 --> 00:10.698
Both of you,
hands up in the air!

00:10.799 --> 00:13.437
Slowly, motherfucker!

00:13.537 --> 00:14.907

00:18.046 --> 00:19.750
LEON:
Cops hit the pool hall.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.888
Three of Kane people dead.

00:21.988 --> 00:24.359
(shouts)

00:24.459 --> 00:25.694
Kane in surgery.

00:25.796 --> 00:27.732
Want to guess who it was?

00:27.833 --> 00:29.402
LOUIE:
I approached Teddy.

00:29.502 --> 00:32.241
Made a deal to buy
my cocaine directly from him.

00:32.341 --> 00:34.345
You went to the plug
behind my back?

00:34.446 --> 00:36.316
TEDDY:
My doing business with her...

00:37.385 --> 00:39.422
...not personal.

00:39.522 --> 00:41.994
Just business?

00:42.094 --> 00:44.532
(Franklin sighs)

00:44.632 --> 00:46.703
I got my money.

00:46.804 --> 00:49.042
Got my lady.

00:49.142 --> 00:50.711
Got a baby on the way.

00:50.812 --> 00:52.582
And I've done my patriotic duty.

00:52.682 --> 00:55.789
As of this moment,
our partnership is over.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.629
I'm out.

01:00.664 --> 01:02.535
VERONIQUE:
Oh, yeah. (grunts)

01:02.635 --> 01:04.940
(Franklin grunting)

01:05.040 --> 01:07.278
(both moaning)

01:11.821 --> 01:13.858
(Franklin chuckling)

01:15.728 --> 01:18.400
I can't believe that happens.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.473
Ah, which part?

01:21.573 --> 01:23.577
That we come at the same time.

01:23.677 --> 01:25.581
It's unicorn sex.

01:25.681 --> 01:27.318
That's how you got
that baby up in you.

01:27.418 --> 01:28.788
Oh, that's how it happened, huh?

01:28.888 --> 01:30.658
(laughs)

01:40.110 --> 01:42.582
I had this wonderful dream
last night

01:42.682 --> 01:46.323
that you'd walked away
from the game.

01:46.423 --> 01:48.627
I woke up this morning,

01:48.727 --> 01:51.566
had this weight
off my shoulders.

01:51.666 --> 01:54.405
Didn't even know it was there.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.811
It's really over?

01:58.113 --> 02:00.351
It's really over.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.563
I was thinking...

02:08.500 --> 02:10.872
...after seeing
Jerome and Louie's...

02:10.972 --> 02:13.745
we should get married.

02:14.712 --> 02:17.351
(laughs)

02:17.451 --> 02:19.422
I know we was gonna wait,

02:19.522 --> 02:21.827
but we should do it
before the baby comes.

02:21.928 --> 02:24.365
Make it official.

02:24.465 --> 02:26.670
Well...

02:26.771 --> 02:28.607
you get a ring and come correct,

02:28.707 --> 02:30.077
then I guess we'll see
what happens.

02:30.177 --> 02:31.680
(both laughing)

02:34.719 --> 02:37.525
Oh, man.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.164
I made a lot of bad decisions
in my life.

02:42.702 --> 02:44.740
But as long as I have you...

02:46.476 --> 02:49.115
...I know I would have made
at least one good one.

02:52.688 --> 02:54.525
I love you.

02:54.626 --> 02:57.465
Love you, too, baby.

03:33.136 --> 03:35.174
(sighs)

03:35.274 --> 03:37.611
What happened?

03:37.712 --> 03:40.517
The target was inside
the building when we entered.

03:42.588 --> 03:44.659
It was 3:00 in the morning.
We couldn't have known.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.198
I cleaned it up.

03:47.298 --> 03:50.437
Cleared out some files
I thought might be helpful.

03:51.841 --> 03:53.878
But I need a safe house.

03:55.214 --> 03:57.451
To read through files?

04:31.186 --> 04:34.125
Hey, it is 6:30 in the morning.

04:34.225 --> 04:36.129
What is wrong with you?

04:36.229 --> 04:37.899
- (lamp shatters)

04:37.999 --> 04:40.037
Goddamn it!

Both of you upstairs now--
I want you dressed

04:47.351 --> 04:48.855
and ready for school
in five minutes.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.992
- But I didn't do it!
- Now.

04:53.697 --> 04:56.036
Pinches savages.

05:14.138 --> 05:16.643
We should move
in this motherfucker.

05:16.744 --> 05:18.313
(both laugh)

05:18.413 --> 05:20.617
- Breakfast in bed every morning.
- Mmm.

05:20.717 --> 05:22.789
Right? Fresh sheets every night.

05:22.889 --> 05:25.995
Or we buy a nicer house
and get a maid.

05:26.096 --> 05:27.899
I like that. Why don't
we get a maid that can cook?

05:27.999 --> 05:29.903
We gonna get a white maid.

05:30.003 --> 05:31.706
(laughing)

05:31.807 --> 05:34.278
A white maid?

05:34.378 --> 05:36.851
No, no, she got to make
the sweet potato pie.

05:36.951 --> 05:38.888
- Not the pumpkin pie.
- Pumpkin pie-- you right, you right, you right.

05:38.988 --> 05:41.626
- I don't want no damn pumpkin pie.
- (pager beeping)

05:41.726 --> 05:44.565
- It's...
- Hey, no, no, no, no.

05:44.665 --> 05:46.871
Put that down.
I'm gonna take the battery out.

Morning.

06:00.364 --> 06:02.368
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Hmm, that's fine.

06:02.468 --> 06:04.940
- What's going on?
- You talk to Franklin?

06:05.040 --> 06:06.977
Not since last night.

06:07.077 --> 06:08.948
He quit.

06:09.048 --> 06:11.719
Means you're gonna be carrying
the load all on your own.

06:11.821 --> 06:13.825
You okay with that?

06:13.925 --> 06:16.196
Can I count on you?

06:17.231 --> 06:18.935
Of course.

06:19.035 --> 06:21.139
(laughing softly)

06:21.239 --> 06:23.043
TEDDY:
That's all I needed to hear.

06:27.051 --> 06:29.622
You're so fucked right now.

06:38.340 --> 06:41.279
Franklin walked away last night.

06:43.316 --> 06:45.687
For real?

06:50.030 --> 06:52.034
Hmm.

06:52.134 --> 06:54.038
Out.

06:54.138 --> 06:56.176
Mm-hmm.

07:01.052 --> 07:03.323
It could be good for us.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.832
No bitterness, no competition.

07:11.005 --> 07:12.943
Sure.

07:13.043 --> 07:15.280
It could be.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.788
You don't think so?

07:22.762 --> 07:24.933
Nah.

07:25.033 --> 07:27.037
Fuck it.

07:27.137 --> 07:29.308
- We in.
- We in!

07:29.408 --> 07:31.679
Get me some more champagne.

07:31.780 --> 07:33.416
And keep this shit going.

07:33.516 --> 07:35.420

VERONIQUE:
Uh-huh, a vacation?

07:41.499 --> 07:43.971
Yeah, sort of,
but like a real long vacation.

07:44.071 --> 07:46.276
- A leave of absence?
- If that means I'm gone a while,

07:46.376 --> 07:48.748
and then I come back and I still
have a job, then yeah, that.

07:48.848 --> 07:50.885
- Okay...
- Fuck!

07:50.985 --> 07:53.223
- Listen to me! I am Franklin Saint...
- Okay.

07:53.323 --> 07:55.828
- Um, that doesn't sound good.
- Wanda, if that's your path, you need to walk it.

07:55.929 --> 07:57.832
- We'll see where we are when you get back, okay?
- Okay, thank you.

07:57.933 --> 07:59.368
I hope everything's okay!

07:59.468 --> 08:01.272
So-so-so listen to me,
listen to me.

08:01.372 --> 08:03.276
Huh? Listen.

08:03.376 --> 08:06.215
I'm gonna call you back
in 30 minutes.

08:06.316 --> 08:08.988
And you'd better have answers.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.159
What the hell is going on?

08:11.259 --> 08:13.898
(sighs)
My money.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.004
It's all gone.

GUSTAVO:
I'm just coming back, Xiapita.

08:27.324 --> 08:29.729
I have to unload.
What's the problem?

08:29.830 --> 08:31.466
There's no problem.

08:31.566 --> 08:35.006
I just had fun yesterday
and thought it might be nice

08:35.107 --> 08:37.779
to get some time with you before
the kids get back from school.

08:37.879 --> 08:39.181
No bueno.

08:39.282 --> 08:41.251
I'll be by as soon as I can,
okay?

08:41.352 --> 08:43.456
Promise?

08:43.556 --> 08:45.360
Simón.

08:45.460 --> 08:47.498
- (line clicks)
- (dial tone)

08:49.502 --> 08:51.339
LEON:
Can't be out here
talking about helping

08:51.439 --> 08:53.109
our people
while I'm selling 'em rock.

08:53.209 --> 08:55.748
So if Franklin's done,

08:55.848 --> 08:58.119
I'm out, too.

08:58.219 --> 08:59.957
Well, who we gonna buy from?

09:00.057 --> 09:01.794
Big Rome?

09:01.894 --> 09:03.263
Could do that.

09:03.363 --> 09:06.035
Or could be y'all had enough.

09:06.135 --> 09:07.939
And y'all give it up, too.

09:08.039 --> 09:09.876
Why the fuck would we do that?

09:09.977 --> 09:11.479
Let someone else make our money?

09:11.579 --> 09:13.450
The game's about to change,
all right?

09:13.550 --> 09:15.487
Congress is writing
a new law right now.

09:15.587 --> 09:17.157
Bill's gonna pass
before the midterms.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.560
RENNY:
"Midterms"?

09:18.660 --> 09:20.530
- Einstein's midterms?
- Nigga,

09:20.630 --> 09:22.267
my exams ain't until January...

09:22.368 --> 09:23.971
Midterm elections, nigga.

09:24.071 --> 09:25.374
In November.

09:25.474 --> 09:26.877
Gonna make it so one gram

09:26.977 --> 09:28.246
of rock gets you
the same prison term

09:28.346 --> 09:29.816
as 100 grams of powder.

09:29.916 --> 09:31.486
Now, why would they do that?

09:31.586 --> 09:33.824
So they can lock up Black folks.

09:33.924 --> 09:35.494
They want to see
the next generation in chains.

09:35.594 --> 09:37.364
And this is
how they gonna do it.

09:37.464 --> 09:39.903
So it's time
to get out the game.

09:40.003 --> 09:42.307
Start a legit business, invest.

09:42.408 --> 09:45.080
Buy a house.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.449
Shit, start a car dealership
like the nigga

09:46.549 --> 09:47.919
in the commercials
with the elephant.

09:48.019 --> 09:50.057
Anything other than this.

09:51.325 --> 09:53.329
BIG D:
Nigga, if you out,

09:53.430 --> 09:55.467
that mean I'm in charge?

10:01.479 --> 10:03.984
CISSY:
All the accounts,
even the Caymans?

10:04.085 --> 10:05.822
Caymans, Panama,

10:05.922 --> 10:07.358
Iranian bank in L. A.--
everything gone.

10:07.458 --> 10:09.896
CISSY:
How much...
how much did they get?

10:09.996 --> 10:11.599
$73 million.

10:20.016 --> 10:22.121
FRANKLIN:
If this was
a legitimate seizure,

10:22.221 --> 10:24.525
we'd all be in handcuffs.

10:26.095 --> 10:27.899
It was him.

10:29.402 --> 10:31.305
Had to be.

10:34.545 --> 10:36.582
Fuck it.

10:37.684 --> 10:39.288
What are you gonna do?

10:39.388 --> 10:41.092
I'm gonna call Teddy,
tell him I made a mistake,

10:41.192 --> 10:43.496
want to keep doing business
with him.

10:43.596 --> 10:45.200
Then I'll kidnap his ass

10:45.300 --> 10:46.602
and torture him
until he gives it up.

10:46.702 --> 10:48.039
VERONIQUE:
You do this,

10:48.139 --> 10:49.910
not only will you never

10:50.010 --> 10:52.481
get the money back, but you'll
get us all killed, Franklin.

10:52.581 --> 10:54.618
(line beeps)

10:55.687 --> 10:57.926
(buttons beeping)

10:59.095 --> 11:00.932
(hangs up phone)

11:03.670 --> 11:05.373
We've got calls out to the best

11:05.474 --> 11:07.277
forensic accountants
in the country.

11:07.377 --> 11:09.148
There will be records
of the transfers.

11:09.248 --> 11:11.119
- And we can track the funds.
- (laughs)

11:11.219 --> 11:13.924
And what if we track it
into some CIA slush fund?

11:14.024 --> 11:15.560
Then what, huh,
we gonna steal it back?

11:15.660 --> 11:17.932
Once we've located the money,
there are ways.

11:18.032 --> 11:19.936
Yeah, this is it.

11:20.036 --> 11:21.506
This is what I grew up doing,
remember?

11:21.606 --> 11:23.076
I know what I'm talking about.

11:23.176 --> 11:25.180
This is everything
I fucking worked for!

11:26.616 --> 11:28.553
I can't just sit around
and wait.

11:28.653 --> 11:30.557
If you torture
and kill a CIA officer,

11:30.657 --> 11:32.361
there's no coming back
from that.

11:32.461 --> 11:34.498
I'm sorry, V.

11:37.037 --> 11:39.008
- Where are you going?
- Avi's.

11:39.108 --> 11:41.012
He knew
about the Panama accounts.

11:41.112 --> 11:42.681
Could've been
the one who set me up.

11:42.782 --> 11:44.552
And him and Teddy are
still working together.

11:44.652 --> 11:47.224
Might be able to reach him
if Teddy won't return my pages.

11:47.324 --> 11:49.061
You think you can trust him?

11:49.161 --> 11:50.965
- No.
- What about Gustavo?

11:51.065 --> 11:52.367
Would he help?

11:52.468 --> 11:54.672
I've been paging him,
haven't heard back.

11:56.075 --> 11:59.048
All right, I need a full workup
of everything we have left.

11:59.148 --> 12:01.419
What we own, what we owe,
and how long we can stay afloat

12:01.519 --> 12:04.658
with zero cash reserves
and only the rental income.

12:04.759 --> 12:07.030
Call you if I hear anything.

12:09.301 --> 12:11.405
(pager beeping)

12:13.143 --> 12:15.180
If you need to make a call...

12:18.720 --> 12:21.292
(beeping)

12:22.594 --> 12:24.632
It can wait.

12:27.772 --> 12:30.210
Okay, so here I am.

12:33.349 --> 12:35.387
What's wrong?

12:38.726 --> 12:40.765
Actually nothing.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.444
Just...

12:47.544 --> 12:49.582
thought that you might
want to know...

12:52.221 --> 12:55.727
...that as of this morning
I am in possession...

12:55.828 --> 12:59.435
of over $70 million
in seized cash assets.

13:00.537 --> 13:03.209
I'm sorry, did you say 17?

13:03.309 --> 13:05.714
No, I said 70.

13:05.815 --> 13:08.319
73 to be exact.

13:09.588 --> 13:10.690
(Havemeyer chuckles)

13:10.791 --> 13:13.363
(exhales)

13:13.463 --> 13:16.335
Do I want to know
where it's from?

13:17.805 --> 13:20.477
Only that its owner
can never claim it.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.751
Now, of course some of it goes

13:23.851 --> 13:26.122
to Nicaragua, but as you know,

13:26.222 --> 13:27.558
thanks to our efforts,
that conflict

13:27.658 --> 13:30.297
is finally
starting to wind down.

13:30.397 --> 13:32.568
Esquipulas was a major success.

13:32.668 --> 13:35.540
Peace negotiations begin
in the next year.

13:36.777 --> 13:39.048
And that leaves us

13:39.148 --> 13:41.319
with $73 million
to spend elsewhere.

13:42.521 --> 13:44.725
Sounds like you're willing
to make a...

13:44.826 --> 13:46.495
very generous donation

13:46.596 --> 13:48.299
to your former employer.

13:48.399 --> 13:50.637
Yes, I am.

13:50.738 --> 13:53.476
Just one small catch.

14:02.561 --> 14:04.598
(line ringing)

14:06.202 --> 14:07.805
(phone rings)

14:07.905 --> 14:09.809
Wilfred Plumbing.

14:09.909 --> 14:11.780
Yeah, um, I need

14:11.880 --> 14:13.549
to speak with Ruben, please.

14:13.650 --> 14:15.320
Who may I say is calling?

14:15.420 --> 14:17.357
This is Cissy Saint.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.763
Ruben's out on a job right now.

14:19.863 --> 14:21.565
But I'll let him know
you called and he'll get back

14:21.666 --> 14:23.436
in touch with you
just as soon as possible.

14:23.536 --> 14:25.507
All right, tell him
it's an emergency, please.

14:25.607 --> 14:27.644
I will.

14:27.745 --> 14:29.749
Thanks so much for call...

14:31.218 --> 14:34.124
I want this cleaned up
and done by tonight.

14:34.224 --> 14:36.262
Is that understood?

14:37.664 --> 14:39.535
Yes.

14:39.635 --> 14:41.672
Find something in the files.

14:41.773 --> 14:43.676
Or get it from him.

14:43.777 --> 14:46.582
But you do not want to walk
away from this empty-handed.

14:48.186 --> 14:50.223
♪ ♪

15:01.780 --> 15:04.118
Aah, what the f...? Aah!

15:04.218 --> 15:06.255
Fuck.

15:12.869 --> 15:15.173
Untie me.

15:15.273 --> 15:16.910
Get me some aspirin, man.

15:17.010 --> 15:19.381
We can talk
like civilized people.

15:19.481 --> 15:22.220
I'd like to do that.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.258
Believe me.

15:24.358 --> 15:27.564
But first I'm gonna need
some information from you.

15:27.664 --> 15:30.270
I bet.

15:30.370 --> 15:32.909
Got everything you want.

15:33.009 --> 15:35.413
Hard proof of drug money

15:35.513 --> 15:37.351
for guns,

15:37.451 --> 15:40.156
CIA involvement-- enough

15:40.256 --> 15:41.860
to destabilize America,

15:41.960 --> 15:44.231
make Mother Russia very happy.

15:44.331 --> 15:47.204
What?

15:47.304 --> 15:49.441
You surprised I figured out

15:49.541 --> 15:50.878
who you work for?

15:50.978 --> 15:52.447
No.

15:54.485 --> 15:56.655
I know you're a former Mossad.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.530
Then you should also know
I have no loyalties

16:00.630 --> 16:03.937
to the United States
or anyone in it.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.244
Not the CIA.

16:08.413 --> 16:11.519
Not Teddy McDonald.

16:11.619 --> 16:14.391
Not even Franklin Saint.

16:14.491 --> 16:18.366
Though I'll admit
I am fond of the boy.

16:18.466 --> 16:21.472
Then you should have no problem
giving me what I need.

16:22.875 --> 16:25.748
There's one problem.

16:25.848 --> 16:28.686
In order for me to help you,

16:28.787 --> 16:30.991
I need you to give me assurances

16:31.092 --> 16:33.663
that I will leave here alive.

16:34.799 --> 16:37.204
Come on, Avi.

16:38.907 --> 16:41.212
You know you're not
in a position to negotiate.

16:41.312 --> 16:43.349
Oh, yeah?

16:43.449 --> 16:45.487
I think I might be.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.959
'Cause I'm not the only one
in trouble here.

16:48.059 --> 16:49.628
Am I?

16:49.728 --> 16:52.234
Dead agent, kidnapping.

16:52.334 --> 16:53.871
And so far,

16:53.971 --> 16:55.875
nothing to show for it.

16:55.975 --> 16:58.546
RUBEN:
I have you.

17:00.517 --> 17:02.487
And the files
from your warehouse.

17:02.587 --> 17:04.525
Mm, the files won't help you.

17:04.625 --> 17:07.430
I've learned long ago
not to put

17:07.531 --> 17:10.436
the launch codes
where the keys are.

17:12.307 --> 17:14.545
The Center won't like it
if you make a mess

17:14.645 --> 17:17.250
in their kitchen
and give them nothing to eat.

17:17.349 --> 17:20.656
They'll put you on the first
boat back to Moscow.

17:20.758 --> 17:23.496
You'll spend the rest
of your life as a shipping clerk

17:23.596 --> 17:25.968
in Vladivostok.

17:27.537 --> 17:31.278
But maybe you like...
the solitude.

17:31.378 --> 17:33.817
The freezing cold.

17:35.453 --> 17:38.626
But something tells me
it's not who you are.

17:38.726 --> 17:41.532
That for you,

17:41.632 --> 17:44.505
it would not be just death...

17:44.605 --> 17:46.642
but also torture.

17:48.446 --> 17:50.483
(chuckling)

17:52.721 --> 17:55.727
You want to talk about torture?

17:55.828 --> 17:57.999
If you won't talk,

17:58.099 --> 18:00.804
and there's nothing
in those files...

18:03.376 --> 18:05.814
...you're going to find out
all about it.

18:05.915 --> 18:08.419
(siren wailing)

18:12.795 --> 18:14.832
(indistinct P. A. announcement)

18:17.103 --> 18:19.308
(indistinct radio chatter)

18:23.382 --> 18:25.420
(indistinct chatter)

18:48.901 --> 18:51.038
- (line rings, clicks)
- TEDDY: Hey.

18:51.138 --> 18:54.111
You sure are paging me a lot
for someone who quit on me.

18:54.211 --> 18:56.482
I made a mistake.

18:56.582 --> 18:59.021
Want to keep our business going.

18:59.121 --> 19:02.594
Look, I was angry.

19:02.694 --> 19:04.598
I felt betrayed.

19:04.698 --> 19:06.669
But I woke up this morning,
you know, I was thinking about

19:06.770 --> 19:08.639
what we said, how it was gonna
be you and me until the end.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.610
- We're not there yet.
- Sorry, it's too late.

19:10.710 --> 19:12.714
Come on, it's-it's not too late.

19:12.815 --> 19:14.151
It's never too late.

19:14.251 --> 19:17.390
I mean, you really think
you can trust Louie?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.127
Man, she's not ready.

19:19.227 --> 19:20.998
She's gonna fuck
your whole world up.

19:21.098 --> 19:23.069
Maybe she'll get me shot.

19:23.169 --> 19:25.406
Right? Maybe her father
will go to the press.

19:25.506 --> 19:27.444
That kind of thing?

19:27.544 --> 19:29.782
Look.

19:29.882 --> 19:31.552
You want to stay in business?

19:31.652 --> 19:33.924
I suggest you go buy your bricks
from Louie. I got to go.

19:34.024 --> 19:36.629
All right, look, it's...
You know what? It's fine.

19:36.729 --> 19:38.099
You want to play that way,
it's fine.

19:38.199 --> 19:40.169
(stammers)
Just-just put the money...

19:40.270 --> 19:42.440
put the money back into
my account, and then, uh,

19:42.540 --> 19:44.011
and-and you and me,
we'll have no problem.

19:44.111 --> 19:45.580
The what?

19:47.717 --> 19:49.187
Don't do that.

19:49.288 --> 19:50.858
Don't play dumb.

19:50.958 --> 19:52.928
Buddy, I got no idea
what you're talking about.

19:53.029 --> 19:54.799
Right. Yeah.

19:54.899 --> 19:57.537
Like you had no idea
what happened to my pops? Huh?

19:57.637 --> 19:59.876
Like I'm sure you had no idea
who torched Avi's warehouse

19:59.976 --> 20:01.512
and disappeared him.

20:01.612 --> 20:04.484
How stupid do you think I am?

20:04.584 --> 20:06.088
Avi's missing? Are you sure?

20:06.188 --> 20:07.825
Stop with
the fucking bullshit, okay?!

20:07.925 --> 20:09.963
I did everything you wanted,
and you fucked me!

20:10.063 --> 20:12.033
Listen, if somebody got
ahold of your cash, I'm sorry.

20:12.133 --> 20:13.703
I warned you about
being so visible.

20:13.804 --> 20:15.841
I warned you
about bringing your money

20:15.941 --> 20:17.143
- in through the Caymans...
- Listen to me, you cracker motherfucker.

20:17.243 --> 20:19.147
Listen to me. Okay?

20:19.247 --> 20:21.218
If I don't have that money
in 24 hours,

20:21.318 --> 20:23.924
I-I promise to God
that I will devote every second

20:24.024 --> 20:26.562
I have on this green Earth
to making sure you

20:26.662 --> 20:28.532
and everybody
you care about suffers.

20:28.632 --> 20:30.503
Do you understand me?

20:30.603 --> 20:31.973
You should be
very careful right now.

20:32.073 --> 20:34.077
You think
you've lost everything?

20:34.177 --> 20:36.215
Just wait.

20:40.289 --> 20:42.795
(hangs up phone)

20:45.066 --> 20:47.137
(breathing heavily)

20:47.237 --> 20:48.907
(groans)

20:57.323 --> 21:00.831
AVI:
I told you these files
won't help you.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.778
You don't look like
any Russian I've ever met.

21:07.878 --> 21:10.616
My father was a diplomat.

21:10.717 --> 21:13.757
Stationed in Cuba
after World War II.

21:14.926 --> 21:16.628
I see.

21:16.729 --> 21:20.904
Met himself a nice Cuban girl,
fell in love?

21:23.275 --> 21:24.912
(sighs)

21:26.582 --> 21:29.756
Then my mother died, and my
father took me back to Moscow.

21:30.758 --> 21:32.627
Diplomat's son.

21:32.727 --> 21:34.131
Spanish speaker.

21:34.231 --> 21:36.903
I bet they couldn't wait
to put their hooks into you.

21:38.139 --> 21:41.178
Did your research ever turn up

21:41.278 --> 21:45.720
that my father and mother
were both Russian Jews?

21:46.756 --> 21:48.192
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

21:48.292 --> 21:51.900
Fled the Pale of Settlement
in 1902.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.237
Went to Palestine.

21:55.339 --> 21:57.577
Ah, yeah, well...

21:57.677 --> 22:00.716
Now both my parents
are long gone.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.660
And Israel's turned
its back on me.

22:07.197 --> 22:08.867
Perhaps I...

22:08.967 --> 22:12.006
Perhaps I should consider,
you know,

22:12.107 --> 22:14.311
going back to my roots.

22:16.081 --> 22:18.252
You were right.

22:18.352 --> 22:20.189
I do need this information.

22:21.191 --> 22:24.097
And soon, the only way
I'll have of getting it...

22:25.066 --> 22:28.740
...will be by breaking you
in a way that can't be fixed.

22:30.811 --> 22:32.982
Don't make me do that
to you, Avi.

22:34.417 --> 22:35.653
Please.

22:37.858 --> 22:40.229
Promise me on the soul
of your dead mother

22:40.329 --> 22:44.839
that if I tell you
where to find what you want...

22:45.841 --> 22:47.310
...you'll let me go.

22:48.279 --> 22:51.118
I swear to you,

22:51.218 --> 22:54.090
if you give me what I need,

22:54.191 --> 22:56.228
I will save your life.

23:12.293 --> 23:14.397
Hey, hey, hey!

23:14.498 --> 23:15.700
(speaks Spanish)

23:15.801 --> 23:17.303
- (shushes)
- (door closes)

23:29.929 --> 23:32.133
(Gustavo speaks Spanish)

23:33.702 --> 23:36.074
- Pinche bug.
- You sure?

23:37.811 --> 23:39.849
(sighs) Christ, Gustavo.

23:41.718 --> 23:43.222
Who would do this?

23:43.322 --> 23:45.259
Looks like Teddy, I guess.

23:48.065 --> 23:49.835
Hmm? And we never come back.

23:49.936 --> 23:51.940
But he's the CIA.
H-He'll find us.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.944
Nah.

23:54.044 --> 23:55.680
Coming after us?

23:55.781 --> 23:57.818
Not worth his time.

24:00.122 --> 24:03.028
(pager beeping, vibrating)

24:04.331 --> 24:07.270
Second page in one hour.

24:09.007 --> 24:10.343
(sighs)

24:11.846 --> 24:12.748
Listen.

24:12.848 --> 24:14.384
Pack up todo.

24:14.484 --> 24:16.154
And the kids, hmm?

24:16.255 --> 24:17.156
Quietly.

24:17.257 --> 24:18.726
I do one more thing,

24:18.827 --> 24:20.329
then I come back and...
(speaks Spanish)

24:20.429 --> 24:22.100
And that's how we're gonna live?

24:22.200 --> 24:23.904
On the fucking run?

24:24.004 --> 24:26.208
What kind of life
is that gonna be?

24:26.308 --> 24:28.813
Whatever pinche life we want...
(speaks Spanish)

24:30.951 --> 24:33.222
I got $13 million.

24:45.546 --> 24:47.918
TEDDY:
Man, you got to have Xiamara
take the kids to the E. R.

24:48.018 --> 24:50.323
I need your eyes on this.
This is important.

24:50.423 --> 24:52.293
GUSTAVO:
Sorry, amigo.

24:52.393 --> 24:54.731
Can't leave him.

24:54.832 --> 24:56.736
Give me a few hours.

24:56.836 --> 24:58.439
I'll go with you tonight...
(speaks Spanish)

24:58.539 --> 25:00.777
I don't have a few hours.

25:02.113 --> 25:03.449
You know what?

25:04.986 --> 25:06.388
It's fine.

25:07.858 --> 25:09.427
Do what you got to do.

25:10.396 --> 25:12.433
(indistinct chatter)

25:19.180 --> 25:21.118
Teddy's ducking me.

25:21.218 --> 25:23.155
Avi's missing.
Place is burned down.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.526
Jesus, Franklin.

25:25.626 --> 25:28.365
Sent Elias and Adalyn home.
We can't trust them anymore.

25:28.465 --> 25:31.004
- Where's my mother?
- She went to see Jerome.

25:31.104 --> 25:33.142
Tell him what happened.

25:33.242 --> 25:35.479
What'd you find?

25:35.579 --> 25:39.087
The buildings you own outright?
They're mostly in South Central.

25:39.187 --> 25:41.291
We'd need appraisals to be sure,
but you haven't owned

25:41.391 --> 25:44.531
most of them
for more than a few years.

25:44.631 --> 25:47.503
The property in that area,
it's not appreciating

25:47.603 --> 25:49.441
because of
the increased violence.

25:49.541 --> 25:51.378
But without the cash flow,

25:51.478 --> 25:53.382
how do we hold onto
the downtown property

25:53.482 --> 25:54.885
and not lose the six million

25:54.986 --> 25:56.121
that we put down
in the first place?

25:56.221 --> 25:58.559
How do we, how do we do that?

26:03.435 --> 26:06.809
Even if we sold everything,

26:06.909 --> 26:09.214
we couldn't come close
to covering the payments.

26:10.216 --> 26:12.253
Without auxiliary income
in the next few days,

26:12.353 --> 26:15.159
we will lose that property
and the down payment.

26:15.259 --> 26:17.898
(distorted, echoing):
And, truthfully,
with possible depreciation

26:17.998 --> 26:19.802
on what you own
against the mortgages

26:19.902 --> 26:21.939
of the higher-end property...

26:23.042 --> 26:24.812
(clearly):
...you owe almost more
than you have.

26:24.912 --> 26:27.316
(Franklin laughs)

26:27.417 --> 26:29.454
So I'm not even broke.

26:30.656 --> 26:32.961
- I'm in debt?
- (phone ringing)

26:41.611 --> 26:42.881
This is Franklin.

26:42.981 --> 26:44.819

26:44.919 --> 26:46.555
Oso. Good.

26:46.655 --> 26:49.327
Uh, uh, you with Teddy?

26:49.427 --> 26:51.331
No. Why?

26:51.431 --> 26:53.535
Listen, man, he, um...

26:53.635 --> 26:55.373
he fucked me, okay?

26:55.473 --> 26:57.543
He cleaned me out,
stole all my money.

26:57.643 --> 27:00.549
And I need to know
how I can find him and, um...

27:00.649 --> 27:02.353
Okay?

27:03.422 --> 27:05.059
Oso?

27:05.159 --> 27:07.196
(distant siren wailing)

27:09.701 --> 27:12.306

he'll know I'm the rat.

27:12.407 --> 27:14.879
No, listen, listen, look.

27:14.979 --> 27:16.448
Listen.

27:17.985 --> 27:20.256
He'll do it to you next.

27:20.356 --> 27:22.928
You know he will.

27:23.028 --> 27:24.631
But I could stop this.

27:24.731 --> 27:28.472
I could bring him down
before any of that happens.

27:28.572 --> 27:30.342
Save us both.

27:30.443 --> 27:32.313
His way is the government.

27:34.050 --> 27:35.921
He always wins.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.929
You can't beat him.

27:48.212 --> 27:51.151
