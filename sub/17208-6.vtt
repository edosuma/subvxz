NARRATOR:

00:01.084 --> 00:02.878
<i>All right. Lots to catch up on</i>

00:02.878 --> 00:05.255
<i>and not much time.</i>

00:02.878 --> 00:05.255
<i>So, Jane, married to Michael,</i>

00:05.255 --> 00:06.924
<i>friends with her baby daddy</i>

00:05.255 --> 00:06.924
<i>Rafael,</i>

00:06.924 --> 00:09.009
<i>and currently a little tense</i>

00:06.924 --> 00:09.009
<i>with her</i> abuela.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.303
<i>See, Alba hated her sister</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:11.303
<i>Cecilia, and they hadn't spoken</i>

00:11.303 --> 00:13.722
<i>in 40 years.</i>

00:11.303 --> 00:13.722
<i>But then Jane got in touch</i>

00:13.722 --> 00:15.265
<i>with her granddaughter,</i>

00:13.722 --> 00:15.265
<i>who lived in London.</i>

00:15.265 --> 00:17.309
Hi!

00:15.265 --> 00:17.309
<i>Hi!</i>

00:17.309 --> 00:19.561
<i>And, well, it drove</i>

00:17.309 --> 00:19.561
<i>a wedge between them.</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:22.606
<i>Oh, and Catalina decided</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:22.606
<i>to make a surprise appearance!</i>

00:22.606 --> 00:24.900
Jane! Hi!

00:24.900 --> 00:27.194
Oh, my God.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.194
<i>OMG indeed!</i>

00:27.194 --> 00:30.030
<i>And speaking of,</i>

00:27.194 --> 00:30.030
<i>Petra's twin sister Anezka</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:32.950
<i>froze her and took her place.</i>

00:32.950 --> 00:35.828
<i>But luckily Petra woke up,</i>

00:32.950 --> 00:35.828
<i>and said this:</i>

00:35.828 --> 00:38.372
I am Anezka.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.499
<i>Of course,</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:40.499
<i>Petra had ulterior motives.</i>

00:40.499 --> 00:41.959
Why did you protect me?

00:41.959 --> 00:44.085
Because

00:41.959 --> 00:44.085
of the hotel shares.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.254
They'd be void.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.254
Rafael signed them to you as me.

00:46.254 --> 00:49.717
<i>So first, she made Anezka break</i>

00:46.254 --> 00:49.717
<i>up with her true love, Scott.</i>

00:49.717 --> 00:52.093
<i>And then, she set</i>

00:49.717 --> 00:52.093
<i>her sights on Rafael.</i>

00:52.093 --> 00:53.846
I'm not walking away

00:52.093 --> 00:53.846
from this hotel.

00:53.846 --> 00:54.847
You are.

00:54.847 --> 00:56.724
Why are you doing this?

00:56.724 --> 00:59.977
I'm only going to say this once.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.977
It wasn't me.

00:59.977 --> 01:03.313
<i>I know. Tough times, right?</i>

00:59.977 --> 01:03.313
<i>And speaking of tough,</i>

01:03.313 --> 01:06.441
<i>Rogelio was trying to break</i>

01:03.313 --> 01:06.441
<i>into the American TV scene.</i>

01:06.441 --> 01:08.276
<i>But there was a slight catch.</i>

01:08.276 --> 01:09.778
I will have to reveal my penis.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.405
<i>Oh. And Jane's mom Xo</i>

01:11.405 --> 01:12.740
<i>also had a career revelation</i>

01:12.740 --> 01:14.575
<i>and decided</i>

01:12.740 --> 01:14.575
<i>to open a dance school.</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:17.870
<i>And speaking of moms,</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:17.870
<i>Rafael's was a crime lord.</i>

01:17.870 --> 01:20.372
<i>And she was murdered.</i>

01:17.870 --> 01:20.372
<i>And a clue in the Bible</i>

01:20.372 --> 01:21.874
<i>led to a secret bank account</i>

01:21.874 --> 01:23.542
<i>that the police</i>

01:21.874 --> 01:23.542
<i>were trying to track.</i>

01:23.542 --> 01:26.921
<i>I know. Moms, right?</i>

01:23.542 --> 01:26.921
<i>They're a handful.</i>

01:26.921 --> 01:29.172
<i>And on that note,</i>

01:26.921 --> 01:29.172
<i>let's dive in.</i>

01:29.172 --> 01:32.217
<i>As you all know,</i>

01:29.172 --> 01:32.217
<i>Jane Gloriana Villanueva</i>

01:32.217 --> 01:33.635
<i>grew up loved.</i>

01:33.635 --> 01:35.512
I got to run,

01:33.635 --> 01:35.512
but Abuela's here.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.138
<i>If a bit lonely at times.</i>

01:37.138 --> 01:38.682
<i>And if I'm being honest,</i>

01:38.682 --> 01:39.850
<i>which I'm always being...</i>

01:39.850 --> 01:41.100
JANE:

01:39.850 --> 01:41.100
Excellent tea.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.228
Outstanding, really.

01:43.228 --> 01:46.815
<i>...if she had one wish as a</i>

01:43.228 --> 01:46.815
<i>child, it was to have a sister.</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:49.985
<i>So when Catalina Maria Mora</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:49.985
<i>showed up out of the blue,</i>

01:49.985 --> 01:53.072
<i>well, it didn't feel</i>

01:49.985 --> 01:53.072
<i>like the bomb that it was.</i>

01:53.072 --> 01:54.740
<i>It felt like</i>

01:53.072 --> 01:54.740
<i>that wish come true.</i>

01:54.740 --> 01:55.908
What are you...

01:55.908 --> 01:58.326
doing here?

01:58.326 --> 01:59.912
The craziest thing:

01:59.912 --> 02:02.163
I was heading back

01:59.912 --> 02:02.163
from Venezuela

02:02.163 --> 02:04.332
and I had

02:02.163 --> 02:04.332
an unscheduled layover in Miami.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.711
And I just met you, and I don't

02:04.332 --> 02:07.711
know, it felt like a sign.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.421
NARRATOR:

02:07.711 --> 02:09.421
<i>Oh, she's speaking</i>

02:07.711 --> 02:09.421
<i>Jane's language.</i>

02:09.421 --> 02:11.090
I love that so much.

02:11.090 --> 02:13.092
I left you two voice mails...

02:11.090 --> 02:13.092
My battery's dead.

02:13.092 --> 02:15.094
I figured, so I just came!

02:13.092 --> 02:15.094
( laughter )

02:15.094 --> 02:17.012
You must be sexy cop husband.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.680
I don't know about sexy,

02:17.012 --> 02:18.680
but, uh...

02:18.680 --> 02:20.181
but cop is... true.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.768
Ooh! Sexy<i> and</i> modest!

02:22.768 --> 02:24.103
NARRATOR:

02:22.768 --> 02:24.103
<i>Ooh!</i>

02:24.103 --> 02:26.647
<i>She's a kisser!</i>

02:24.103 --> 02:26.647
Okay. Um...

02:26.647 --> 02:27.856
No, come on in!

02:26.647 --> 02:27.856
( laughter )

02:27.856 --> 02:29.024
Oh! Lovely!

02:29.024 --> 02:30.692
Welcome. We're moving.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.694
Oh, fun, I love moving!

02:32.694 --> 02:33.988
NARRATOR:

02:32.694 --> 02:33.988
<i>Who loves moving?</i>

02:33.988 --> 02:35.530
Really?

02:33.988 --> 02:35.530
Of course! It's a chance

02:35.530 --> 02:36.615
to redecorate, reinvent...

02:36.615 --> 02:38.199
( gasps )

02:36.615 --> 02:38.199
Is that

02:38.199 --> 02:40.035
a doggie door?

02:38.199 --> 02:40.035
I love dogs!

02:40.035 --> 02:41.453
You have a dog?

02:41.453 --> 02:43.831
Um, we're discussing

02:41.453 --> 02:43.831
getting a cat.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.666
Heh, they're preliminary

02:43.831 --> 02:45.666
discussions.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.585
If you want a cat, get a cat!

02:45.666 --> 02:48.585
What's there to discuss?

02:48.585 --> 02:49.586
Well, Jane's more

02:48.585 --> 02:49.586
of the planning type.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.088
( grunts )

02:49.586 --> 02:51.088
Ah.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.798
Well, that's never

02:51.088 --> 02:52.798
been my strong suit.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.424
NARRATOR:

02:52.798 --> 02:54.424
<i>Clearly.</i>

02:52.798 --> 02:54.424
( inhales )

02:54.424 --> 02:55.717
Okay, so. Full confession:

02:55.717 --> 02:57.970
this visit isn't

02:55.717 --> 02:57.970
totally unmotivated.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.554
My<i> abuela</i> knows we connected

02:57.970 --> 02:59.554
and wanted to see

02:59.554 --> 03:01.431
if we could help

02:59.554 --> 03:01.431
them fix things.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.183
Oh. Um... my grandma

03:01.431 --> 03:04.183
asked me to stay out of it.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.894
But I want to hang out with<i> you.</i>

03:05.894 --> 03:08.772
Please, stay here tonight.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.772
Oh, no! I-I can't.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.440
I don't want to impose,

03:08.772 --> 03:10.440
you're moving.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.692
Who cares?

03:10.440 --> 03:11.692
We'll pull out sheets.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.652
Right, Michael?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.652
Oh. Yeah, why not?

03:13.652 --> 03:15.236
( laughing ):

03:13.652 --> 03:15.236
Oh, great!

03:15.236 --> 03:16.905
Um, the loo?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.115
Hm?

03:18.115 --> 03:19.282
The bathroom.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.617
Through there.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.617
Thank you.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.538
( quietly ):

03:22.410 --> 03:24.538
Are you sure about this?

03:24.538 --> 03:26.999
Michael, come on.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.999
She's my first cousin.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.709
Well, actually,

03:26.999 --> 03:28.709
not my<i> first</i> cousin.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.169
Maybe my third? But still,

03:30.169 --> 03:31.378
who cares?

03:31.378 --> 03:34.006
A cousin. I have a cousin!

03:34.006 --> 03:35.632
NARRATOR:

03:34.006 --> 03:35.632
<i>Aw, looks like Jane is finally</i>

03:35.632 --> 03:37.300
<i>getting that tea party</i>

03:35.632 --> 03:37.300
<i>she always wanted.</i>

03:37.300 --> 03:38.802
( laughing ):

03:37.300 --> 03:38.802
So...

03:38.802 --> 03:40.721
after Oxford, I met

03:38.802 --> 03:40.721
this guy in a rock band

03:40.721 --> 03:42.056
and followed him to Paris.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.682
He was a nihilist

03:42.056 --> 03:43.682
and a philistine

03:43.682 --> 03:46.309
but gorgeous and,

03:43.682 --> 03:46.309
ugh, so brilliant.

03:46.309 --> 03:49.312
We broke up within days

03:46.309 --> 03:49.312
but I decided to stay

03:46.309 --> 03:49.312
and take culinary classes,

03:49.312 --> 03:51.523
which is when I studied under

03:49.312 --> 03:51.523
Ludo before living in Berlin.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.025
Wow.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.069
I've been

03:53.025 --> 03:55.069
on an airplane four times.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.528
( laughter )

03:56.528 --> 03:59.073
I<i> love</i> that top, by the way.

03:59.073 --> 04:01.116
( Jane moaning )

03:59.073 --> 04:01.116
CATALINA:

03:59.073 --> 04:01.116
Right?

04:01.116 --> 04:02.743
Mm-hm.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.743
I am telling you,

04:02.743 --> 04:04.327
this lady who owned

04:02.743 --> 04:04.327
this brothel in Thailand

04:04.327 --> 04:06.621
was a genius!

04:06.621 --> 04:09.041
JANE: Mm!

04:06.621 --> 04:09.041
( chuckles )

04:09.041 --> 04:11.752
And they threatened to run away,

04:09.041 --> 04:11.752
but my grandma chickened out,

04:11.752 --> 04:14.213
so Alba convinced her to spend

04:11.752 --> 04:14.213
the night in the barn.

04:14.213 --> 04:17.257
( laughter )

04:14.213 --> 04:17.257
JANE:

04:14.213 --> 04:17.257
<i>She's incredible, Michael.</i>

04:17.257 --> 04:19.009
Well traveled and artistic

04:19.009 --> 04:22.137
and adventurous

04:19.009 --> 04:22.137
and<i> so</i> funny.

04:19.009 --> 04:22.137
Mm.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.848
We were up all night.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.848
Oh, I heard. When do you think

04:24.848 --> 04:26.975
she's gonna be out of the

04:24.848 --> 04:26.975
shower? 'Cause the movers are

04:24.848 --> 04:26.975
gonna be here any minute.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.937
I'm sure she's almost done.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.937
( shower turns off )

04:29.937 --> 04:31.772
So...

04:31.772 --> 04:34.149
we were actually talking about

04:31.772 --> 04:34.149
her staying for a few more days.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.400
With us?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.194
In our new place?

04:37.194 --> 04:39.988
There's so much

04:37.194 --> 04:39.988
to catch up on.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.282
Wh... What?

04:39.988 --> 04:42.282
What was that look?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.492
( quietly ):

04:42.282 --> 04:44.492
Well, don't you think

04:42.282 --> 04:44.492
it's a little weird

04:44.492 --> 04:47.121
that she shows up...

04:44.492 --> 04:47.121
unannounced?

04:47.121 --> 04:48.538
( clicks tongue )

04:47.121 --> 04:48.538
Aw.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.249
You've just been

04:48.538 --> 04:50.249
around me too long.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.918
Not everyone's a planner.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.918
Her style's more...

04:52.918 --> 04:55.045
spontaneous.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.045
CATALINA:

04:52.918 --> 04:55.045
Morning, morning!

04:55.045 --> 04:56.964
NARRATOR:

04:55.045 --> 04:56.964
<i>Apparently, her style</i>

04:56.964 --> 04:59.216
<i>doesn't include wearing a bra.</i>

04:59.216 --> 05:01.093
Hey!

04:59.216 --> 05:01.093
So...

05:01.093 --> 05:03.137
we actually talked

05:01.093 --> 05:03.137
about it, and...

05:03.137 --> 05:05.097
please stay with us

05:03.137 --> 05:05.097
for a few more days!

05:03.137 --> 05:05.097
Yes!

05:05.097 --> 05:06.598
Incredible, fun,

05:05.097 --> 05:06.598
I'd love to!

05:05.097 --> 05:06.598
( both laugh )

05:06.598 --> 05:09.101
( giggling )

05:09.101 --> 05:10.685
( whistling )

05:10.685 --> 05:12.187
( explosion )

05:12.187 --> 05:14.689
( theme music playing )

05:19.360 --> 05:21.905
And you don't have to meet her.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.905
I know you don't want to.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.698
I just wanted you

05:21.905 --> 05:23.698
to know she's here.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.117
( in Spanish )

05:23.698 --> 05:25.117
Alright.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.952
Thank you for telling me.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.870
<i>Y...</i>

05:26.952 --> 05:28.870
( clears throat )

05:28.870 --> 05:30.956
Good luck with the move.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.707
Thanks. You have to come

05:30.956 --> 05:32.707
by the new place.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.502
As soon as Cat leaves.

05:37.545 --> 05:38.630
So, I should go to my meeting.

05:37.545 --> 05:38.630
Hopefully,

05:38.630 --> 05:40.132
I can get my T.A. job back.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.300
The dean said no way

05:40.132 --> 05:41.300
you're getting

05:41.300 --> 05:42.717
your T.A. job back.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.636
Apparently that bridge

05:42.717 --> 05:44.636
has been burned.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.763
( shrieking ): No!

05:44.636 --> 05:46.763
Wait, wait, this is a mistake!

05:46.763 --> 05:49.057
To a crisp.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.057
( shouting )

05:49.057 --> 05:51.852
But I was at a party

05:49.057 --> 05:51.852
the other night, and I ran

05:51.852 --> 05:53.145
into Leslie Clark from

05:51.852 --> 05:53.145
Silver Horizon Publishing.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.855
Have you heard of them?

05:54.855 --> 05:57.149
Romance with a slant towards

05:54.855 --> 05:57.149
historical fiction,

05:57.149 --> 05:59.442
won a RITA award for their

05:57.149 --> 05:59.442
<i>Dawn's Early Light</i> trilogy

05:59.442 --> 06:00.902
set in the War of 1812?

06:00.902 --> 06:02.654
( laughing ):

06:00.902 --> 06:02.654
Yes.<i> Yes.</i>

06:02.654 --> 06:04.156
Yes. I've heard of them.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.783
Well, she's looking

06:04.156 --> 06:06.783
for a new assistant.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.576
Really?

06:06.783 --> 06:08.576
W-What does that entail?

06:08.576 --> 06:10.120
I have no idea.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.163
It was a party.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.413
I recommended you.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.874
What?

06:12.413 --> 06:13.874
Yeah. Here's her card.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.625
Her current assistant's info

06:13.874 --> 06:15.625
is on there.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.544
Oh, my God! Thank you so much!

06:20.297 --> 06:23.382
I'm gonna hug you,

06:20.297 --> 06:23.382
okay? Just stand still.

06:23.382 --> 06:26.261
( exclaims )

06:23.382 --> 06:26.261
NARRATOR:

06:23.382 --> 06:26.261
<i>In a less huggy mood...</i>

06:26.261 --> 06:28.096
When I said I wanted you

06:26.261 --> 06:28.096
out of the hotel,

06:26.261 --> 06:28.096
it wasn't theoretical.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.973
No, I have someone

06:28.096 --> 06:29.973
lined up to rent out

06:28.096 --> 06:29.973
your penthouse.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.391
NARRATOR:

06:29.973 --> 06:32.391
<i>As you'll recall, Petra Solano</i>

06:32.391 --> 06:34.311
<i>was back from the dead</i>

06:32.391 --> 06:34.311
<i>and on a rampage.</i>

06:34.311 --> 06:35.937
What?

06:35.937 --> 06:37.438
It was a majority

06:35.937 --> 06:37.438
shareholder decision.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.233
Meaning my decision.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.650
NARRATOR:

06:39.233 --> 06:40.650
<i>Hell,</i> I'm<i> scared of her!</i>

06:40.650 --> 06:41.902
Why are you doing this?

06:40.650 --> 06:41.902
I just...

06:41.902 --> 06:43.195
I don't understand.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.072
Here's what I don't understand.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.991
How you were married to me,

06:45.072 --> 06:47.991
said you loved me,

06:47.991 --> 06:50.660
then slept with my sister

06:47.991 --> 06:50.660
and worked alongside her

06:50.660 --> 06:54.831
for months without ever

06:50.660 --> 06:54.831
realizing it wasn't me.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.042
NARRATOR:<i> Yeah.</i>

06:54.831 --> 06:57.042
<i>I got nothing either, buddy.</i>

06:57.042 --> 06:59.794
I'm sorry.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.794
It's... all I can say.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.505
But we have children together.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.505
Yes, and that's unfortunate.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.965
We'll have the nannies

07:02.505 --> 07:03.965
coordinate.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.802
End of next week,

07:05.633 --> 07:07.802
I want you out.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.721
ROGELIO:

07:07.802 --> 07:09.721
<i>I'm stunned.</i>

07:09.721 --> 07:12.849
Did you drop my name

07:09.721 --> 07:12.849
at the bank?

07:09.721 --> 07:12.849
Yeah, unfortunately,

07:12.849 --> 07:14.726
it didn't translate

07:12.849 --> 07:14.726
into a boost to my credit score.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.271
Then I will loan you the money

07:14.726 --> 07:17.271
to open your dance studio.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.314
I thought you might offer,

07:17.271 --> 07:19.314
but no.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.608
You'll say you won't interfere,

07:21.608 --> 07:23.235
but then you'll want a say.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.819
Of course I'll want a say!

07:24.819 --> 07:26.863
In fact, you should

07:24.819 --> 07:26.863
want me to have a say.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.990
I'm excellent at branding

07:26.863 --> 07:28.990
and promotion.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.785
Plus, I know a little something

07:28.990 --> 07:31.785
about dance...

07:31.785 --> 07:33.661
( scoffs )

07:31.785 --> 07:33.661
I know you<i> think</i> you do.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.871
NARRATOR:

07:33.661 --> 07:34.871
<i>What's this?</i>

07:34.871 --> 07:36.290
<i>Some kind of private joke?</i>

07:36.290 --> 07:37.749
Well. Come on, at least

07:36.290 --> 07:37.749
show me the place

07:37.749 --> 07:38.833
you're interested in renting.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.211
Sorry. No. Sorry.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.212
Sorry. Uh-uh. All right.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.797
Hey!

07:43.797 --> 07:45.590
I'm off carbs.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.590
I need to slim down

07:45.590 --> 07:47.301
for my big full frontal scene.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.677
What about the crew?

07:47.301 --> 07:49.677
The crew's naked body

07:49.677 --> 07:52.055
is not gonna not be featured

07:49.677 --> 07:52.055
in an indie feature!

07:52.055 --> 07:53.974
Fine. They want you in makeup,

07:53.974 --> 07:55.642
and here are

07:53.974 --> 07:55.642
some script revisions.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.518
Thank you, Rudy.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.518
( chuckles )

07:58.478 --> 08:01.022
ROGELIO:

07:58.478 --> 08:01.022
<i>What the hell?</i>

08:01.022 --> 08:03.108
This is a huge episode.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.108
I finally see Ava

08:03.108 --> 08:05.735
and realize she went through

08:03.108 --> 08:05.735
the time portal after me.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.612
It's a turning point

08:05.735 --> 08:07.612
in the novela.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.781
We had to...

08:07.612 --> 08:09.781
And it's supposed to

08:07.612 --> 08:09.781
happen in the episode

08:09.781 --> 08:11.574
where I prevent

08:09.781 --> 08:11.574
the third world war

08:11.574 --> 08:13.243
by ending the Cuban

08:11.574 --> 08:13.243
Missile Crisis.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.454
The thing is, you...

08:13.243 --> 08:15.454
And why does

08:13.243 --> 08:15.454
the episode now

08:15.454 --> 08:17.664
take place in Vernon J.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.664
Herzing's house?

08:17.664 --> 08:20.041
And who the hell is that?!

08:20.041 --> 08:22.461
( dings )

08:22.461 --> 08:25.546
I guess you made some sort

08:22.461 --> 08:25.546
of deal with the studio?

08:25.546 --> 08:27.424
All nudity

08:25.546 --> 08:27.424
in television and film

08:27.424 --> 08:30.218
is not permitted,

08:27.424 --> 08:30.218
as it tarnishes our brand.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.679
So, what are you saying?

08:30.218 --> 08:32.679
I can't take the part?

08:32.679 --> 08:36.683
You can do it. If you do

08:32.679 --> 08:36.683
something for us in exchange.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.686
We have a chance to do a product

08:36.683 --> 08:39.686
integration and make some money

08:39.686 --> 08:41.980
for the show and for the studio.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.857
But the writers said no.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.735
Well, allow me to overrule

08:43.857 --> 08:47.735
the writers.

08:47.735 --> 08:51.323
Okay, so I'll eat the cereal

08:47.735 --> 08:51.323
during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.200
But HBO wasn't invented then.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.411
The TV station?

08:53.200 --> 08:56.411
The cereal.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.121
Who cares?

08:56.411 --> 08:58.121
No one will notice.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.539
PETRA:

08:58.121 --> 08:59.539
<i>Enough!</i>

09:00.999 --> 09:03.293
Stop following me.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.293
I-It's just...

09:03.293 --> 09:04.461
now that you rethought

09:03.293 --> 09:04.461
leaving, I thought

09:04.461 --> 09:05.628
maybe you rethought us.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.131
I didn't.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.131
But...

09:08.131 --> 09:10.633
what we had, uh... the things

09:08.131 --> 09:10.633
we said to each other. What...?

09:10.633 --> 09:12.844
NARRATOR:

09:10.633 --> 09:12.844
<i>Just a friendly reminder:</i>

09:12.844 --> 09:15.638
<i>That wasn't Petra.</i>

09:12.844 --> 09:15.638
<i>That was all Anezka.</i>

09:15.638 --> 09:18.517
My sister had a health crisis,

09:18.517 --> 09:20.477
and I... I melted down.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.145
And now that

09:20.477 --> 09:22.145
she feels better,

09:22.145 --> 09:23.563
well, I...

09:23.563 --> 09:25.148
I feel different, too.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.316
NARRATOR:

09:25.148 --> 09:26.316
<i>I'll say.</i>

09:26.316 --> 09:28.443
So, let me

09:28.443 --> 09:30.862
be unequivocal.

09:30.862 --> 09:34.657
We are never, ever

09:30.862 --> 09:34.657
getting back together.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.410
Ever.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.414
You don't have to throw

09:37.911 --> 09:40.414
our song in my face!

09:40.414 --> 09:42.290
JANE:

09:40.414 --> 09:42.290
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

09:42.290 --> 09:44.251
I could be working directly

09:42.290 --> 09:44.251
with the publisher.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.960
Getting to read galleys,

09:45.960 --> 09:47.754
and observe the editing process

09:45.960 --> 09:47.754
from start to finish.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.589
Amazing!

09:47.754 --> 09:49.589
That's amazing, babe!

09:49.589 --> 09:51.216
I know. Uh, I...

09:49.589 --> 09:51.216
( chuckles )

09:51.216 --> 09:53.093
I am a little nervous

09:51.216 --> 09:53.093
about the interview.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.928
You know, Donaldson didn't have

09:53.093 --> 09:54.928
any details on the job

09:54.928 --> 09:56.430
so I can't do

09:54.928 --> 09:56.430
my usual hard-core prepping.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.306
Oh, you'll be fine.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.059
( sighs )

09:58.306 --> 10:01.059
I got a job as a sommelier

09:58.306 --> 10:01.059
on a Greek island

10:01.059 --> 10:03.395
one summer, and I knew

10:01.059 --> 10:03.395
exactly<i> zero</i> about wine.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.105
I totally faked it.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.357
Dropped some buzz words

10:05.105 --> 10:07.357
like "oaky" and "bouquet"

10:07.357 --> 10:08.567
at the interview.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.567
Really?

10:08.567 --> 10:10.735
Truly. And this

10:08.567 --> 10:10.735
is terrible wine.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.320
I'm buying you

10:10.735 --> 10:12.320
some wine.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.697
Trust me. Everything

10:12.320 --> 10:14.697
you need to know,

10:14.697 --> 10:17.117
you can learn

10:14.697 --> 10:17.117
on the job. Just...

10:17.117 --> 10:20.036
lead with confidence.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.456
NARRATOR:

10:20.036 --> 10:22.456
<i>Which brings us here, now...</i>

10:25.750 --> 10:27.210
Hi! I'm Jane!

10:27.210 --> 10:28.336
NARRATOR:

10:27.210 --> 10:28.336
<i>Confidence, not volume.</i>

10:28.336 --> 10:30.422
Sorry. I'm excited.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.715
Heh. I'm Jane.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.715
You must be Alice.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.551
We spoke on the phone?

10:32.715 --> 10:34.551
Yes. Hi.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.635
It's good you're excited.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.220
You should be; Leslie is great.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.763
I'll let her know you're here.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.682
( sighs )

10:41.682 --> 10:44.144
And considering

10:41.682 --> 10:44.144
Silver Horizon's slant

10:44.144 --> 10:45.853
towards historical fiction,

10:44.144 --> 10:45.853
I think it would be

10:45.853 --> 10:47.188
a perfect fit for me.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.607
And I'd work my butt off.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.607
Well, Jane,

10:48.607 --> 10:51.192
I really like your energy,

10:51.192 --> 10:52.402
and you come with quite

10:52.402 --> 10:54.362
a recommendation.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.362
Marlene Donaldson?

10:54.362 --> 10:55.863
She hates everybody.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.324
It took me a while

10:57.324 --> 10:58.699
but I finally wore her down.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.659
We hug now.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.952
Oh, come on.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.163
Well, once,

11:00.952 --> 11:03.163
but I might try it again.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.789
NARRATOR:

11:03.163 --> 11:04.789
<i>Way to go, Jane,</i>

11:03.163 --> 11:04.789
<i>you're crushing it.</i>

11:04.789 --> 11:06.666
And you know Spark Express,

11:04.789 --> 11:06.666
of course?

11:09.628 --> 11:11.838
Of course, yes, absolutely.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.882
Great.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.510
Um, could you help me

11:14.882 --> 11:16.510
with this issue?

11:16.510 --> 11:18.595
NARRATOR:

11:16.510 --> 11:18.595
<i>Uh-oh... now?</i>

11:18.595 --> 11:20.180
I can't seem

11:18.595 --> 11:20.180
to delete this field.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.222
Oh, yeah.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.432
Sure.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.724
Let's see.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.189
This one?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.398
Uh-huh.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.398
Okay.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.192
So, did you

11:30.398 --> 11:32.192
try highlighting it?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.068
Mm-hm.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.320
Uh-oh.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.447
What's... what's wrong?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.447
I-I...

11:37.447 --> 11:38.657
I seem to have

11:37.447 --> 11:38.657
deleted the file.

11:38.657 --> 11:39.907
Uh, l-let me just undo it.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.493
( scoffs )

11:41.493 --> 11:43.036
Would you... just in case,

11:41.493 --> 11:43.036
did you back it up?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.371
No.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.331
This is two hours of work.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.082
Alice!

11:48.082 --> 11:49.417
I thought you knew the software.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.502
I meant I'd learn it.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.545
ALICE:

11:50.502 --> 11:51.545
What's going on?

11:51.545 --> 11:53.338
We need I.T. in here.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.548
I'm so sorry.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.174
Just go.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.592
NARRATOR:

11:56.174 --> 11:57.592
<i>Yup.</i>

11:57.592 --> 11:58.843
<i>So, she really bombed that.</i>

11:58.843 --> 12:00.011
( whistling )

12:04.891 --> 12:07.435
The publisher basically threw me

12:04.891 --> 12:07.435
out of her office.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.563
It was a disaster.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.563
I'm sorry, babe.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.606
At least now you know

12:09.563 --> 12:11.606
to trust your instincts.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.567
Oh, no, stop,

12:11.606 --> 12:13.567
you can't give up.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.443
You have the assistant's info,

12:13.567 --> 12:15.443
work her a little.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.320
You can recover.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.320
JANE: I don't know.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.697
This was a pretty epic fail.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.073
Agree.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.073
Just move on.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.241
Don't be silly.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.076
Once, I really

12:21.241 --> 12:23.076
bungled things

12:23.076 --> 12:24.202
while working

12:23.076 --> 12:24.202
Fashion Week in Milan,

12:24.202 --> 12:25.286
but since I was besties

12:25.286 --> 12:26.580
with Zac Posen's assistant,

12:26.580 --> 12:28.623
he got Zac to look

12:26.580 --> 12:28.623
the other way.

12:28.623 --> 12:29.832
Do you have

12:28.623 --> 12:29.832
the assistant's number?

12:29.832 --> 12:31.418
Alice?

12:29.832 --> 12:31.418
Yeah.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.716
Mm?

12:37.716 --> 12:39.676
I can't send that.

12:39.676 --> 12:40.968
Sure you can!

12:40.968 --> 12:42.220
Come on.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.513
Oh.

12:45.764 --> 12:47.141
( phone whooshes )

12:47.141 --> 12:48.268
CATALINA: Yeah!

12:48.268 --> 12:49.852
( phone beeps )

12:49.852 --> 12:51.104
Ah! A smiley face!

12:51.104 --> 12:53.189
Yay! You're in.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.189
( laughs )

12:53.189 --> 12:55.191
CATALINA ( laughing ): Good.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.191
JANE:<i> And it worked, Mom.</i>

12:55.191 --> 12:56.943
I mean, I've been texting

12:55.191 --> 12:56.943
with her assistant all night.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.403
She said she'd work her boss.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.862
XIOMARA:

12:58.403 --> 12:59.862
That's great, hon.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.239
Uh, listen, I should go.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.532
<i>Okay.</i>

13:02.532 --> 13:03.866
Bye, Mom.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.368
Come on.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.827
Let's toast to our new apartment

13:06.827 --> 13:08.829
with our, uh, bad wine.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.665
( chuckles )

13:13.084 --> 13:14.586
Do you ever wish

13:14.586 --> 13:16.003
you traveled?

13:16.921 --> 13:18.632
I mean...

13:18.632 --> 13:20.174
I haven't really

13:18.632 --> 13:20.174
thought about it much.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.800
Me, neither.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.928
Do you want to?

13:23.928 --> 13:25.472
I don't know.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.056
Maybe.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.933
I mean, not now.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.059
After grad school?

13:30.059 --> 13:31.478
What about Mateo?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.146
We would take him.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.606
And my job?

13:35.649 --> 13:37.651
I know, you're right.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.986
It's not practical.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.571
( sighs )

13:49.245 --> 13:51.498
( in Spanish )

13:49.245 --> 13:51.498
I think perhaps, maybe...

13:53.207 --> 13:55.627
I'll meet with Catalina.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.171
What?

13:58.171 --> 14:00.799
I feel distant from Jane

13:58.171 --> 14:00.799
and I don't like it.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.051
So I'll meet her.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.348
Have we met?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.141
Uh, I don't think so.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.518
You're Petra Solano, right?

14:11.518 --> 14:12.811
Yes.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.813
You've been served.

14:14.813 --> 14:15.980
What?

14:15.980 --> 14:18.399
( whistling )

14:18.399 --> 14:20.985
You're suing me

14:18.399 --> 14:20.985
for sexual harassment?

14:20.985 --> 14:22.236
You-You know that's not true.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.364
Your word against mine.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.907
Please keep away.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.907
Are you...

14:26.907 --> 14:28.075
What are you doing?

14:26.907 --> 14:28.075
You've created

14:28.075 --> 14:29.202
a hostile work environment.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.244
I don't feel safe around you.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.245
Now, is there

14:31.245 --> 14:32.330
a work-related topic

14:32.330 --> 14:33.456
you would like

14:32.330 --> 14:33.456
to discuss?

14:33.456 --> 14:34.624
Otherwise,

14:33.456 --> 14:34.624
this conversation

14:34.624 --> 14:36.501
is highly

14:34.624 --> 14:36.501
inappropriate.

14:36.501 --> 14:40.129
Did I blow your mind

14:36.501 --> 14:40.129
or did I blow your mind?

14:40.129 --> 14:43.675
It's beautiful, Rogelio,

14:40.129 --> 14:43.675
but I already saw this online

14:43.675 --> 14:45.468
and it's twice what

14:43.675 --> 14:45.468
I want to spend,

14:45.468 --> 14:47.261
which is why I want

14:45.468 --> 14:47.261
the other one.

14:47.261 --> 14:50.931
Ah, but you didn't factor

14:47.261 --> 14:50.931
in the celebrity discount.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.392
I told the owner

14:50.931 --> 14:52.392
of the strip mall

14:52.392 --> 14:55.019
I'd do a commercial

14:52.392 --> 14:55.019
for his fro-yo place

14:55.019 --> 14:57.480
and negotiated

14:55.019 --> 14:57.480
the rent down to half price.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.066
What?

14:57.480 --> 15:00.066
I told you,

14:57.480 --> 15:00.066
I'm a value add.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.442
( gasps )

15:00.066 --> 15:01.442
Are you serious?!

15:01.442 --> 15:02.736
You know I'm always serious

15:02.736 --> 15:03.737
about dance.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.321
Oh, my God,

15:05.321 --> 15:07.073
would you stop

15:05.321 --> 15:07.073
it already?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.282
NARRATOR:

15:07.073 --> 15:08.282
<i>Okay, I found out what</i>

15:08.282 --> 15:09.784
<i>these private jokes are about.</i>

15:09.784 --> 15:10.951
So, for our first competition,

15:10.951 --> 15:12.495
I think we should do

15:12.495 --> 15:14.247
a high-octane,

15:12.495 --> 15:14.247
"Rhythm Nation"-type routine.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.832
Sweet!

15:14.247 --> 15:15.832
That's tight.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.041
No, no, no, no, no.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.001
Just put me in the center

15:19.001 --> 15:20.545
and have the girls freak up

15:19.001 --> 15:20.545
against me.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.672
To hide that you can't dance?

15:22.672 --> 15:24.382
What?

15:22.672 --> 15:24.382
( girls chuckle )

15:24.382 --> 15:26.760
Please, we know you're

15:24.382 --> 15:26.760
just here to meet girls.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.469
Oh, I can dance.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.054
Prove it.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.472
Let's see you follow my moves.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.475
<i>♪ Let me see you</i>

It's perfect.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.039
<i>And, friends,</i>

15:54.370 --> 15:57.039
<i>it felt too good to be true.</i>

15:57.039 --> 15:58.708
<i>Which it was.</i>

15:58.708 --> 16:00.501
<i>Let them just finish</i>

15:58.708 --> 16:00.501

16:00.501 --> 16:02.044
Congratulations.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.296
It's all yours.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.131
Thank you so much.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.592
<i>And that's when she saw him.</i>

16:10.553 --> 16:12.513
Oh, my God.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.513
<i>Yup. Bruce.</i>

16:12.513 --> 16:14.223
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

16:14.223 --> 16:16.016
<i>You don't know who Bruce is.</i>

16:16.016 --> 16:17.184
<i>Well, listen up.</i>

16:17.184 --> 16:19.019
JANE:

16:17.184 --> 16:19.019
<i>Bruce is the worst!</i>

16:19.019 --> 16:21.147
His law office

16:19.019 --> 16:21.147
is right by your studio?

16:21.147 --> 16:23.149
Can you get out of your lease?

16:23.149 --> 16:24.776
Stop. You're

16:23.149 --> 16:24.776
being crazy.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.653
I'm not!

16:24.776 --> 16:26.653
He's the worst.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.613
Why?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.613
Well,

16:28.613 --> 16:30.949
first, he was married,

16:28.613 --> 16:30.949
and he didn't tell Mom.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.241
Then,

16:32.241 --> 16:33.868
she finds out,

16:32.241 --> 16:33.868
and he keeps saying

16:33.868 --> 16:36.203
that he's gonna leave his wife,

16:33.868 --> 16:36.203
but he never does.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.914
She keeps saying

16:36.203 --> 16:37.914
that she's done,

16:37.914 --> 16:40.333
over and over and over and over,

16:40.333 --> 16:42.502
oh, and over and over.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.962
Mm.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.962
I agree.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.839
He's a jerk.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.839
Now, go to work.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.089
I got Mateo.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.089
I'm just saying that

16:47.089 --> 16:48.633
you don't need

16:47.089 --> 16:48.633
to be around him.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.302
Jane, enough. That was

16:48.633 --> 16:51.302
a different time in my life.

16:51.302 --> 16:54.263
I can't even imagine

16:51.302 --> 16:54.263
being with Bruce now.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.140
People move on.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.184
( gentle theme playing )

17:02.146 --> 17:03.439
( gasps )

17:02.146 --> 17:03.439
( laughs )

17:03.439 --> 17:05.399
Hey. Am I early?

17:05.399 --> 17:07.193
No. I just finished

17:05.399 --> 17:07.193
my shift.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.069
Great. Want to go out

17:07.193 --> 17:09.069
for drinks?

17:09.069 --> 17:11.113
Oh, I can't. Mateo and

17:09.069 --> 17:11.113
Michael are waiting for us.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.406
Oh. One?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.534
We'll strategize

17:12.406 --> 17:14.534
about your career.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.161
Fine. One.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.161
Yes.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.329
<i>And that's when...</i>

17:18.329 --> 17:20.247
Hi there.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.916
Oh, hey. Uh, Rafael,

17:21.916 --> 17:23.543
this is

17:21.916 --> 17:23.543
my cousin Catalina.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.795
Ah,<i> this</i> is Catalina.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.839
And you must be

17:25.795 --> 17:27.839
the baby daddy.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.633
Officially-- but you

17:27.839 --> 17:30.633
can call me Rafael.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.633
( laughs )

17:30.633 --> 17:33.260
<i>Was that a spark between them?</i>

17:33.260 --> 17:35.930
<i>Nah, I was just</i>

17:33.260 --> 17:35.930
<i>reading into it, I'm sure.</i>

17:35.930 --> 17:37.974
Vodka soda, light

17:35.930 --> 17:37.974
on the soda. Jane?

17:37.974 --> 17:39.225
Um...

17:37.974 --> 17:39.225
You know, I think I'll

17:39.225 --> 17:40.643
join you guys for a drink.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.191
So I told him you can't wear

17:44.522 --> 17:47.191
Speedos in the dining room.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.110
( laughing )

17:47.191 --> 17:50.110
<i>Ah, the "kooky guest</i>

17:47.191 --> 17:50.110
<i>in the Speedo" story.</i>

17:50.110 --> 17:52.697
<i>Jane's heard this one</i>

17:50.110 --> 17:52.697
<i>about a hundred times.</i>

17:52.697 --> 17:55.033
So I gave in

17:52.697 --> 17:55.033
and I threw him a robe.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.534
( sputtering laugh )

17:58.202 --> 18:00.747
( sighs ):

17:58.202 --> 18:00.747
So... we should head out.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.790
Oh, no. We ordered

18:00.747 --> 18:02.790
another round

18:02.790 --> 18:04.709
when you went to the loo.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.709
But, hey, you know,

18:04.709 --> 18:06.836
if you need to run...

18:06.836 --> 18:08.546
What's another drink?

18:10.965 --> 18:12.842
So, I spent the summer crewing

18:10.965 --> 18:12.842
on my friend Dorian's yacht

18:12.842 --> 18:15.428
off the coast of Monaco...

18:12.842 --> 18:15.428
Wait, wait. Dorian Moreau?

18:15.428 --> 18:16.763
You know him?

18:15.428 --> 18:16.763
Yes! He threw this

18:16.763 --> 18:18.389
massive party in

18:16.763 --> 18:18.389
the French Riviera,

18:18.389 --> 18:20.140
like, five years ago.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.140
Oh, my God, I was there!

18:20.140 --> 18:21.267
You were there?

18:20.140 --> 18:21.267
Yes!

18:21.267 --> 18:22.309
No way!

18:22.309 --> 18:23.436
( laughing )

18:23.436 --> 18:25.104
( fake laughing )

18:25.104 --> 18:27.147
So funny.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.733
Small world.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.694
Okay, we should

18:28.733 --> 18:31.694
probably call an Uber,

18:31.694 --> 18:33.780
go back to Michael and Mateo.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.532
First dinner at the new place.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.532
Wait.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.659
You're going...

18:36.532 --> 18:38.659
to their first dinner?

18:40.286 --> 18:42.121
You are totally

18:40.286 --> 18:42.121
third-wheeling it.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.456
( gasps )

18:42.121 --> 18:43.456
Oh, my God, am I?

18:43.456 --> 18:44.498
I knew it.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.498
No!

18:44.498 --> 18:45.625
Yes!

18:44.498 --> 18:45.625
No.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.001
Absolutely you are.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.878
Look, let them have

18:47.001 --> 18:48.878
dinner alone, okay?

18:48.878 --> 18:51.297
We stay here and eat, and

18:48.878 --> 18:51.297
then you go back later.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.132
Okay. Is that weird?

18:54.842 --> 18:56.302
No.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.345
No, it's not weird.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.725
Oh. Okay, yes,

19:00.139 --> 19:02.725
I should probably go.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.229
Seeing as I said...

19:07.229 --> 19:09.941
out loud that I was gonna go.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.623
Don't you think

19:24.080 --> 19:25.623
that's a little weird?

19:25.623 --> 19:28.042
Don't you think

19:25.623 --> 19:28.042
that's weird, Mateo?

19:28.042 --> 19:29.669
That you came home drunk

19:28.042 --> 19:29.669
at 7:00 p.m.? Yes.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.379
That he's, like... hitting

19:29.669 --> 19:32.379
on her in front of me.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.966
I mean, not really.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.966
She's definitely his type.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.966
What does<i> that</i> mean?

19:34.966 --> 19:37.010
Hot.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.552
Like you.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.096
You think she's hot?

19:38.552 --> 19:40.096
I think you're hot.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.681
NARRATOR:

19:40.096 --> 19:41.681
<i>Turn it around, man.</i>

19:41.681 --> 19:43.683
Why you acting all jealous?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.683
I'm not jealous.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.267
You love her,

19:43.683 --> 19:45.267
you think she's great,

19:45.267 --> 19:46.393
so what if he does, too?

19:46.393 --> 19:47.603
If he does, too,

19:46.393 --> 19:47.603
that's great.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.813
Great!

19:48.813 --> 19:51.899
<i>Which brings us here, now.</i>

19:51.899 --> 19:53.067
Hey. Did you

19:51.899 --> 19:53.067
have fun last night?

19:53.067 --> 19:54.110
I didn't hear you

19:53.067 --> 19:54.110
come in.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.778
Oh, good. Good.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.571
I was trying to be quiet.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.571
It was so late.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.281
Rafael kept saying we should

19:57.571 --> 19:59.281
give you guys privacy.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.950
Next I know,

19:59.281 --> 20:00.950
we're sloshed

20:00.950 --> 20:03.786
and eating shrimp tacos,

20:00.950 --> 20:03.786
and suddenly I felt all dodgy

20:03.786 --> 20:05.955
being out with your baby's

20:03.786 --> 20:05.955
father, so I came home.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.999
Was it dodgy?

20:07.999 --> 20:09.500
No, it's not dodgy at all.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.710
I mean, with three kids,

20:10.710 --> 20:12.419
it's not like Raf

20:10.710 --> 20:12.419
gets out much.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.006
Brilliant! I'm friends

20:12.419 --> 20:15.006
with my exes, too.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.006
Mm.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.306
So, I need your help.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.349
Excuse me?

20:25.349 --> 20:27.351
Scott is apparently suing me.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.937
( chuckles ) For sexual

20:27.351 --> 20:29.937
harassment, of all things.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.438
What?

20:29.937 --> 20:31.438
Yes, and...

20:31.438 --> 20:33.482
I want it over.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.482
( sighs )

20:33.482 --> 20:35.526
Can I tell my legal team

20:33.482 --> 20:35.526
you'll back me up?

20:35.526 --> 20:37.277
In exchange, you can...

20:37.277 --> 20:39.697
remain in the penthouse.

20:39.697 --> 20:42.658
Well, in exchange,

20:39.697 --> 20:42.658
I want my shares back.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.578
Paying him off will be cheaper.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.959
You okay?

20:51.959 --> 20:54.754
I'm hoping I will be.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.589
Uh, anyways...

20:56.589 --> 21:00.426
I had so much fun

20:56.589 --> 21:00.426
with Catalina last night.

21:00.426 --> 21:04.013
I mean, she is incredible.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.806
Oh, yeah, she's cool.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.017
I was actually thinking about

21:05.806 --> 21:08.017
asking her out again.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.436
Really?

21:10.436 --> 21:11.729
I mean...

21:11.729 --> 21:13.022
she's only here

21:11.729 --> 21:13.022
for a few more days.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.314
Do you really want

21:13.022 --> 21:14.314
to start something

21:14.314 --> 21:16.067
with someone

21:14.314 --> 21:16.067
who's leaving?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.861
I don't know, I really thought

21:16.067 --> 21:18.861
there was a spark between us.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.654
She didn't mention

21:18.861 --> 21:20.654
anything, so...

21:20.654 --> 21:21.697
Really?

21:21.697 --> 21:23.116
Mm.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.954
Jane, if you feel uncomfortable

21:27.954 --> 21:30.123
with me dating your cousin,

21:27.954 --> 21:30.123
I won't do it.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.958
No, I hadn't really

21:30.123 --> 21:31.958
thought about it.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.168
NARRATOR:

21:31.958 --> 21:34.168
<i>Yeah, right. Sorry.</i>

21:34.168 --> 21:36.879
But since you asked,

21:34.168 --> 21:36.879
I guess I am.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.759
So I shouldn't ask her out?

21:41.759 --> 21:44.887
Yeah, I-I think

21:41.759 --> 21:44.887
I'd rather you didn't.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.267
ROGELIO:

21:47.181 --> 21:49.267
<i>I am aggravated!</i>

21:49.267 --> 21:52.019
You're hungry.

21:49.267 --> 21:52.019
No, I just ate

21:52.019 --> 21:53.646
nine pieces of celery

21:52.019 --> 21:53.646
and a saltine.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.439
Unrelated to that,

21:53.646 --> 21:55.439
I'm aggravated

21:55.439 --> 21:57.233
because we should hire

21:55.439 --> 21:57.233
someone to paint.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.776
We can do it ourselves.

21:58.776 --> 22:01.279
But it's going

21:58.776 --> 22:01.279
to take forever.

22:01.279 --> 22:03.572
Less talking and more prepping.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.749
I have an idea on how

22:10.329 --> 22:13.749
to solve our disagreement.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.085
Though you might be

22:13.749 --> 22:16.085
too scared.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.962
Scared of what?

22:17.962 --> 22:19.172
Standard rules apply.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.714
You copy my move,

22:19.172 --> 22:20.714
I copy your move.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.800
Stop stalling.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.800
You're the one who's stalling.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.636
Hm.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.454
Rogelio, are you okay?

22:52.454 --> 22:54.999
I think I pulled

22:52.454 --> 22:54.999
something.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.793
( laughter )

23:06.635 --> 23:08.554
I have a confession

23:06.635 --> 23:08.554
to make.

23:08.554 --> 23:11.307
The truth is,

23:08.554 --> 23:11.307
I didn't sign up

23:11.307 --> 23:12.725
for our high school

23:11.307 --> 23:12.725
dance troupe

23:12.725 --> 23:15.561
to meet girls.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.646
I signed up for

23:15.561 --> 23:17.646
our high school dance troupe

23:17.646 --> 23:20.858
to meet<i> a</i> girl.

23:25.654 --> 23:29.242
I-I'm sorry I've been

23:25.654 --> 23:29.242
so grumpy today.

23:29.242 --> 23:32.078
It's just,

23:29.242 --> 23:32.078
seeing Bruce around

23:32.078 --> 23:34.538
is just really throwing me.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.540
Because you still have

23:34.538 --> 23:36.540
feelings for him?

23:36.540 --> 23:40.127
No!

23:36.540 --> 23:40.127
The opposite.

23:40.127 --> 23:44.673
He messed with

23:40.127 --> 23:44.673
my life for so long...

23:44.673 --> 23:47.301
I never really got

23:44.673 --> 23:47.301
the chance to tell him off.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.054
You still can.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.350
You don't have to sulk.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.350
I'm not.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.852
But I didn't have to

23:54.350 --> 23:56.852
ask you if I could date her.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.312
But you did.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.312
And I said no.

24:00.398 --> 24:03.567
JANE: Hi, honey.

24:00.398 --> 24:03.567
Mwah.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.694
Raf was just leaving.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.694
Oh, okay.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.487
How have you been?

24:05.694 --> 24:07.487
Better before Jane

24:07.487 --> 24:09.489
shut down my

24:07.487 --> 24:09.489
dating life.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.075
( chuckles ):

24:09.489 --> 24:11.075
What are you talking about?

24:09.489 --> 24:11.075
Nothing.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.202
You didn't tell him?

24:11.075 --> 24:13.202
Are you<i> serious?</i>

24:13.202 --> 24:15.453
Tell him what?

24:13.202 --> 24:15.453
She asked me not

24:13.202 --> 24:15.453
to date Catalina.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.706
( whistling )

24:21.252 --> 24:24.422
You told him he couldn't

24:21.252 --> 24:24.422
date her?

24:21.252 --> 24:24.422
I just think it's inappropriate.

24:24.422 --> 24:26.048
How is it inappropriate?

24:26.048 --> 24:28.175
There are three billion

24:26.048 --> 24:28.175
women in this world!

24:29.843 --> 24:31.887
Okay, you know what?

24:29.843 --> 24:31.887
Whatever. Go ahead.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.223
And if it doesn't work

24:31.887 --> 24:34.223
out, who knows,

24:34.223 --> 24:35.349
maybe you could hook up with

24:34.223 --> 24:35.349
one of my other cousins.

24:35.349 --> 24:37.310
Oh, or maybe a sexy great aunt!

24:39.103 --> 24:41.521
Yeah, I think

24:39.103 --> 24:41.521
I'm gonna head out.

24:43.481 --> 24:45.276
Hi, baby.

24:45.276 --> 24:48.028
Who's that? Oh...

24:45.276 --> 24:48.028
( door opens, shuts )

24:48.028 --> 24:50.488
I knew you were jealous.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.488
I'm not jealous.

24:50.488 --> 24:53.242
I just... What if

24:50.488 --> 24:53.242
it doesn't work out?

24:53.242 --> 24:54.701
They're adults.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.287
I'll be in the middle of it.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.287
We share a child!

24:56.287 --> 24:58.580
I don't want that

24:56.287 --> 24:58.580
to get complicated

24:58.580 --> 25:00.958
because of some fling

24:58.580 --> 25:00.958
with a cousin I just met

25:00.958 --> 25:02.751
and I really like!

25:02.751 --> 25:05.004
So this isn't about your

25:02.751 --> 25:05.004
romantic history with Rafael?

25:05.004 --> 25:08.090
No.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.090
Then why didn't you

25:05.004 --> 25:08.090
tell me he asked?

25:08.090 --> 25:09.967
Because...you get

25:08.090 --> 25:09.967
so sensitive about it.

25:09.967 --> 25:11.385
<i>I'm</i> sensitive?

25:16.849 --> 25:18.267
( sighs )

25:18.267 --> 25:19.601
NARRATOR:

25:18.267 --> 25:19.601
<i>Yeah,</i>

25:19.601 --> 25:21.645
<i>things can be tricky</i>

25:19.601 --> 25:21.645
<i>with exes.</i>

25:24.440 --> 25:26.442
Xo...

25:24.440 --> 25:26.442
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR

25:24.440 --> 25:26.442
<i>Which brings us here...</i>

25:26.442 --> 25:28.110
<i>now.</i>

25:28.110 --> 25:30.446
Hey, Bruce.

25:30.446 --> 25:31.905
( chuckles ):

25:30.446 --> 25:31.905
What are you doing here?

25:31.905 --> 25:33.531
I actually rented the place

25:31.905 --> 25:33.531
across the way,

25:33.531 --> 25:35.659
and I saw you.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.659
You moved offices?

25:35.659 --> 25:36.702
Last year, after my divorce.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.578
<i>Oh, no. He's divorced!</i>

25:38.578 --> 25:39.746
Oh.

25:39.746 --> 25:40.831
<i>Stay strong, Xo.</i>

25:40.831 --> 25:42.166
Look...

25:42.166 --> 25:43.834
since we'll be

25:42.166 --> 25:43.834
seeing each other around,

25:43.834 --> 25:45.461
I just wanted to say something.

25:47.254 --> 25:51.050
You were such a douche bag.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.512
<i>And speaking of douche bags...</i>

25:52.718 --> 25:54.512
I've thought

25:54.512 --> 25:55.721
a lot about this.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.348
And, look, for

25:55.721 --> 25:57.348
everyone's sake,

25:57.348 --> 25:59.683
I just want this to all

25:57.348 --> 25:59.683
go away. My lawyers and I

25:59.683 --> 26:01.643
were able to come up

25:59.683 --> 26:01.643
with a number

26:01.643 --> 26:03.103
to settle out of court.

26:07.858 --> 26:10.110
It's not about the money.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.612
It's about the fact

26:10.110 --> 26:12.612
that you obviously used me.

26:12.612 --> 26:14.698
I didn't...

26:12.612 --> 26:14.698
Liar.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.160
And I'm gonna make you pay.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.912
I have a burn book, remember?

26:19.912 --> 26:21.788
I know a lot about you.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.874
Your real name...

26:23.874 --> 26:26.460
the fact that you were married

26:23.874 --> 26:26.460
to an arms dealer...

26:26.460 --> 26:28.879
Oh. And, um...

26:28.879 --> 26:30.256
( whispering inaudibly )

26:31.924 --> 26:33.633
XIOMARA:

26:31.924 --> 26:33.633
<i>It's over.</i>

26:33.633 --> 26:36.220
I said everything that

26:33.633 --> 26:36.220
I have to say to Bruce, and...

26:36.220 --> 26:37.804
he got it.

26:37.804 --> 26:40.640
Heh, and I have

26:37.804 --> 26:40.640
to say, I feel great.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.269
That's wonderful, Xiomara.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.269
<i>Yeah. So thank you</i>

26:43.269 --> 26:44.937
for encouraging me to do that.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.855
<i>Of course.</i>

26:46.855 --> 26:50.526
And can I just say... I love

26:50.526 --> 26:52.861
<i>our friendship.</i>

26:52.861 --> 26:55.281
I-I love the place

26:52.861 --> 26:55.281
that we've gotten to.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.033
Me, too.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.617
Good-bye, Xiomara.

26:59.617 --> 27:01.537
( gentle theme playing )

27:10.296 --> 27:11.505
This doesn't make any sense!

27:11.505 --> 27:13.424
Tiago sees Ava

27:13.424 --> 27:17.010
kissing another guy,

27:13.424 --> 27:17.010
and he turns and walks away?!

27:17.010 --> 27:18.971
Rogelio, can we just discuss

27:17.010 --> 27:18.971
this in your dressing room?

27:18.971 --> 27:20.473
No! We're gonna

27:18.971 --> 27:20.473
discuss it here!

27:20.473 --> 27:21.932
My blood sugars

27:20.473 --> 27:21.932
are extremely low,

27:21.932 --> 27:23.476
and I cannot find the truth

27:23.476 --> 27:25.685
in this ridiculous

27:23.476 --> 27:25.685
scene. Tiago,

27:25.685 --> 27:28.188
he has been looking for Ava

27:25.685 --> 27:28.188
through time and space,

27:28.188 --> 27:31.609
and when he finally sees her,

27:28.188 --> 27:31.609
she is kissing another man!

27:31.609 --> 27:33.193
And he walks away

27:33.193 --> 27:35.529
and doesn't tell her

27:33.193 --> 27:35.529
how he feels?!

27:35.529 --> 27:37.281
It just doesn't make any sense!

27:37.281 --> 27:39.241
NARRATOR:

27:37.281 --> 27:39.241
<i>Which part?</i>

27:37.281 --> 27:39.241
He'd tell her.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.160
<i>Oh, see, that part I bought.</i>

27:41.160 --> 27:44.037
I have to agree.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.037
Should we go back

27:44.037 --> 27:46.415
to the Vernon Herzing story?

27:44.037 --> 27:46.415
Every one at the Honey Bunch

27:46.415 --> 27:47.665
loved that storyline.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.298
XIOMARA:

27:52.463 --> 27:54.298
<i>So, how'd you leave it?</i>

27:54.298 --> 27:57.176
Well, Michael's still mad at me,

27:54.298 --> 27:57.176
I'm still mad at Rafael,

27:57.176 --> 27:58.302
Rafael's probably

27:58.302 --> 27:59.428
still mad at me.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.054
And how about Catalina?

28:01.054 --> 28:02.848
She's steering clear,

28:01.054 --> 28:02.848
I think.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.141
Can you blame her?

28:04.141 --> 28:05.976
Anyway, don't

28:04.141 --> 28:05.976
bring it up at dinner.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.311
Abuela,

28:07.311 --> 28:08.770
you look so nice!

28:08.770 --> 28:10.606
That's her fourth

28:08.770 --> 28:10.606
wardrobe change.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.899
( in Spanish )

28:10.606 --> 28:12.899
I was just cold and then got hot

28:12.899 --> 28:14.734
cooking, but now I'm cold again.

28:14.734 --> 28:17.488
She spent three hours

28:14.734 --> 28:17.488
making arepas.

28:17.488 --> 28:20.740
( in Spanish )

28:17.488 --> 28:20.740
I spent over four hours making

28:17.488 --> 28:20.740
my one-of-a-kind arepas.

28:20.740 --> 28:23.701
and get your hands off them.

28:20.740 --> 28:23.701
Don't touch!

28:23.701 --> 28:25.496
( knocking )

28:23.701 --> 28:25.496
( gasps ) That's her.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.667
( laughs ):

28:27.956 --> 28:29.667
Alba, hi!

28:29.667 --> 28:31.877
I brought

28:29.667 --> 28:31.877
my world-famous arepas.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.671
NARRATOR:

28:31.877 --> 28:33.671
<i>Rival arepas!</i>

28:33.671 --> 28:35.881
<i>And unsecured tatas!</i>

28:35.881 --> 28:38.592
<i>This is going to be a long...</i>

28:38.592 --> 28:39.593
( laughter )

28:39.593 --> 28:40.719
<i>Oh, wow. Look at that.</i>

28:40.719 --> 28:42.179
<i>I was totally wrong.</i>

28:42.179 --> 28:44.014
But they had

28:42.179 --> 28:44.014
to sneak out of the house

28:44.014 --> 28:45.891
to practice, right?

28:45.891 --> 28:48.101
Their father did not

28:45.891 --> 28:48.101
approve of dancing.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.145
She said he was

28:48.101 --> 28:50.145
<i>very</i> strict.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.315
( in Spanish )

28:50.145 --> 28:53.315
Yes! He used to say

28:50.145 --> 28:53.315
"In this house, no dancing"

28:53.315 --> 28:54.191
"only marching!"

28:54.191 --> 28:55.568
Ah?

28:54.191 --> 28:55.568
Yeah!

28:55.568 --> 28:57.361
And that night,

28:57.361 --> 28:59.488
Alba won the town

28:57.361 --> 28:59.488
dance contest.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.198
Fair and square.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.198
But she was

28:59.488 --> 29:01.198
Oh.

29:01.198 --> 29:04.577
disqualified because her skirt

29:01.198 --> 29:04.577
was two inches too short.

29:04.577 --> 29:07.120
Abuela!

29:04.577 --> 29:07.120
Mommy?

29:07.120 --> 29:08.706
( in Spanish )

29:07.120 --> 29:08.706
I have nice legs. I wanted

29:07.120 --> 29:08.706
to show them off.

29:08.706 --> 29:10.332
CATALINA:

29:08.706 --> 29:10.332
Oh, it was

29:10.332 --> 29:12.000
quite the scandal.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.000
And that was

29:12.000 --> 29:13.377
the first night you met Mateo.

29:13.377 --> 29:14.712
Mm-hm.

29:14.712 --> 29:16.922
Mm. My grandma was devastated.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.924
( groans ) And she was

29:16.922 --> 29:18.924
so sorry about

29:18.924 --> 29:20.217
what she did after.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.217
Devastated?

29:20.217 --> 29:22.094
Why was she devastated?

29:22.094 --> 29:23.887
Well, because she'd been in love

29:22.094 --> 29:23.887
with him first, right?

29:23.887 --> 29:26.432
And you sort of

29:23.887 --> 29:26.432
stole him away?

29:30.352 --> 29:32.854
( in Spanish )

29:30.352 --> 29:32.854
That is not what happened!

29:32.854 --> 29:34.147
How dare you!

29:34.147 --> 29:35.357
I'm so sorry.

29:35.357 --> 29:36.775
That's what

29:35.357 --> 29:36.775
my<i> abuela</i> told me.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.151
( in Spanish )

29:36.775 --> 29:38.151
Your abuela is a liar!

29:38.151 --> 29:40.237
Abuela.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.237
Mom.

29:40.237 --> 29:43.073
( in Spanish )

29:40.237 --> 29:43.073
You don't come into my house

29:40.237 --> 29:43.073
and tell lies about me!

29:43.073 --> 29:45.409
You're as bad as your

29:43.073 --> 29:45.409
grandmother!

29:45.409 --> 29:47.327
And your arepas are dry!

29:48.078 --> 29:49.913
( whistling )

29:54.418 --> 29:57.254
I can't believe

29:54.418 --> 29:57.254
how I bungled that.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.005
And we were

29:57.254 --> 29:59.005
getting along.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.049
Well, she'll...

29:59.005 --> 30:01.049
get over it.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.926
NARRATOR:<i> Are we</i>

30:01.049 --> 30:02.926
<i>talking about the same</i> abuela?

30:02.926 --> 30:04.470
Maybe.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.305
I didn't even think

30:04.470 --> 30:06.305
it was controversial.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.223
I thought that

30:06.305 --> 30:08.223
was the story.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.142
Really?

30:08.223 --> 30:10.142
Yeah, of course.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.769
That's what<i> everyone</i> thinks.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.437
( phone buzzes )

30:29.536 --> 30:31.246
Skinny Bloody Maria.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.206
Extra celery, please.

30:33.206 --> 30:36.084
NARRATOR:

30:33.206 --> 30:36.084
<i>Ah, yes. The new friendship.</i>

30:36.084 --> 30:38.003
Hey, can I ask you

30:36.084 --> 30:38.003
a question?

30:38.003 --> 30:40.005
Sure.

30:40.005 --> 30:43.216
Do you think it's weird that

30:40.005 --> 30:43.216
I want to date Jane's cousin?

30:43.216 --> 30:45.969
Well, it depends.

30:43.216 --> 30:45.969
How much do you like her?

30:45.969 --> 30:47.429
Well, a...

30:47.429 --> 30:49.306
A lot, actually.

30:49.306 --> 30:52.267
I mean, I really felt,

30:49.306 --> 30:52.267
like, a... like a spark.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.102
Which is rare.

30:54.102 --> 30:56.480
So rare. Uh-huh.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.359
People spend a lot of

30:56.480 --> 31:00.359
time searching for that,

31:00.359 --> 31:04.112
and if that spark turns

31:00.359 --> 31:04.112
into a forest fire of love

31:04.112 --> 31:06.156
for someone...

31:06.156 --> 31:07.533
someone you could envision

31:07.533 --> 31:09.702
spending the rest

31:07.533 --> 31:09.702
of your life with...

31:09.702 --> 31:11.411
No, we-we just met, you know.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.913
It's a little early for that.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.913
I barely know her.

31:13.913 --> 31:17.000
A person you somehow keep

31:13.913 --> 31:17.000
finding your way back to,

31:17.000 --> 31:20.086
after years and years apart--

31:17.000 --> 31:20.086
well, that's...

31:20.086 --> 31:22.172
that's even rarer, no?

31:22.172 --> 31:23.590
Are we still talking

31:22.172 --> 31:23.590
about Catalina?

31:23.590 --> 31:26.092
So what... if Xo

31:23.590 --> 31:26.092
and I have this

31:26.092 --> 31:28.261
obstacle?

31:26.092 --> 31:28.261
I'm obviously

31:28.261 --> 31:31.348
still in love with her, and

31:28.261 --> 31:31.348
the kid's a big hypothetical.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.517
She's here, and she's real.

31:33.517 --> 31:36.936
I should tell her

31:33.517 --> 31:36.936
how I'm feeling.

31:36.936 --> 31:39.314
Rafael, this was

31:36.936 --> 31:39.314
a great talk.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.024
NARRATOR:

31:39.314 --> 31:41.024
<i>And, friends,</i>

31:41.024 --> 31:42.568
<i>Rogelio had played this scene</i>

31:41.024 --> 31:42.568
<i>a thousand times</i>

31:42.568 --> 31:43.985
<i>in telenovelas.</i>

31:43.985 --> 31:46.279
<i>The hero racing to</i>

31:43.985 --> 31:46.279

31:46.279 --> 31:48.156
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

31:57.957 --> 32:00.377
( door opens )

32:00.377 --> 32:01.837
You have a fix for the script?

32:01.837 --> 32:03.547
Hm.

32:03.547 --> 32:04.840
Yes.

32:06.550 --> 32:09.428
There has to be a reason

32:06.550 --> 32:09.428
why Tiago doesn't speak up

32:09.428 --> 32:11.263
when he sees them kissing.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.514
Something emotional

32:12.514 --> 32:14.808
that haunts him from his past.

32:14.808 --> 32:16.935
NARRATOR:<i> The fact</i>

32:14.808 --> 32:16.935
<i>that he didn't raise Jane.</i>

32:16.935 --> 32:18.854
ROGELIO: The fact that he didn't

32:16.935 --> 32:18.854
stop the Hiroshima bomb

32:18.854 --> 32:21.481
last time, because

32:18.854 --> 32:21.481
he and Ava were making love.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.982
Go on.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.982
So, yes,

32:22.982 --> 32:25.694
he loves her.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.905
But he's also

32:25.694 --> 32:27.905
reminded that he...

32:27.905 --> 32:30.073
NARRATOR:

32:27.905 --> 32:30.073
<i>Wants another child.</i>

32:30.073 --> 32:32.785
...wants to stop

32:30.073 --> 32:32.785
the Bay of Pigs.

32:32.785 --> 32:36.246
So, when he sees

32:32.785 --> 32:36.246
her kissing that troll,

32:36.246 --> 32:37.623
he takes it as a sign.

32:39.332 --> 32:41.627
To stick to his initial mission.

32:42.586 --> 32:43.796
I like it. Yeah,

32:43.796 --> 32:44.755
I'll jump back into the script

32:44.755 --> 32:46.715
and make

32:44.755 --> 32:46.715
those changes.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.093
( door opens )

32:50.093 --> 32:51.303
NARRATOR:

32:50.093 --> 32:51.303
<i>Also jumping back in...</i>

32:51.303 --> 32:52.304
DENNIS:

32:51.303 --> 32:52.304
Hey-hey,

32:52.304 --> 32:53.764
you're looking better.

32:53.764 --> 32:55.181
Oh, let's hope

32:53.764 --> 32:55.181
the doctor agrees with you.

32:55.181 --> 32:56.308
I just had my physical.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.601
Anything new on the case?

32:57.601 --> 32:59.478
Just that you were right.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.646
The numbers in Mutter's Bible...

33:03.064 --> 33:05.734
belong to a bank account.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.235
But they don't know

33:05.734 --> 33:07.235
whose bank account?

33:07.235 --> 33:09.446
Not yet.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.446
They're working on it.

33:09.446 --> 33:10.656
So what's the...

33:09.446 --> 33:10.656
Look, I really...

33:10.656 --> 33:13.366
( clicks tongue )

33:10.656 --> 33:13.366
Go on.

33:13.366 --> 33:14.451
Just that I'm sorry.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.453
I left a message

33:14.451 --> 33:16.453
for Rafael,

33:16.453 --> 33:18.037
and I told him I'm fine

33:16.453 --> 33:18.037
with him dating Catalina.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.331
( phone chimes )

33:23.585 --> 33:25.462
What?

33:23.585 --> 33:25.462
Oh...

33:25.462 --> 33:26.922
Alice just invited me

33:25.462 --> 33:26.922
to join the assistants' group

33:26.922 --> 33:28.214
for happy hour.

33:28.214 --> 33:30.258
Well, as Cat would say,

33:28.214 --> 33:30.258
"Jolly good!

33:30.258 --> 33:32.135
Let's definitely go."

33:32.135 --> 33:34.095
Stop. Okay,

33:32.135 --> 33:34.095
w-we don't have to.

33:34.095 --> 33:35.430
Y-Yes, we do.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.431
Because I'm not gonna be

33:36.431 --> 33:37.641
the stick in the mud

33:37.641 --> 33:39.142
that ruins

33:37.641 --> 33:39.142
this opportunity for you.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.562
We're doing this.

33:42.562 --> 33:43.730
I'll do it.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.273
I'll give you

33:43.730 --> 33:45.273
your shares back

33:45.273 --> 33:46.358
if you lie about Scott.

33:47.776 --> 33:50.570
If I agree to do this,

33:50.570 --> 33:51.905
no more blackmail,

33:51.905 --> 33:53.323
no more threats.

33:53.323 --> 33:55.367
We are even.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.994
Equal partners again.

33:59.245 --> 34:01.414
Equal partners.

34:01.414 --> 34:04.543
I am prepared to say

34:01.414 --> 34:04.543
that you harassed her.

34:04.543 --> 34:07.379
Which makes it your word

34:04.543 --> 34:07.379
against ours.

34:07.379 --> 34:10.131
And we will drag your

34:07.379 --> 34:10.131
name through the mud

34:10.131 --> 34:11.925
and sue you into oblivion.

34:11.925 --> 34:14.135
You'll end up broke

34:11.925 --> 34:14.135
and humiliated

34:14.135 --> 34:16.555
with no hope and zero

34:14.135 --> 34:16.555
prospects for the future.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.348
Or...

34:18.348 --> 34:20.809
you can give up this

34:18.348 --> 34:20.809
ridiculous lawsuit,

34:20.809 --> 34:22.853
and we can all move on.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.523
I don't know why you

34:24.646 --> 34:26.523
won't just move on.

34:26.523 --> 34:28.191
Because you won't admit

34:26.523 --> 34:28.191
you were jealous.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.902
JANE:

34:28.191 --> 34:29.902
Fine.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.486
I'm jealous.

34:31.486 --> 34:32.529
But you want to know what?

34:32.529 --> 34:33.906
It's not even about him.

34:33.906 --> 34:35.281
It's about her.

34:36.867 --> 34:38.493
Catalina makes me feel

34:36.867 --> 34:38.493
a little boring, okay?

34:38.493 --> 34:39.828
She lives this

34:39.828 --> 34:41.038
exciting

34:39.828 --> 34:41.038
and glamorous life.

34:41.038 --> 34:42.664
And...

34:42.664 --> 34:43.916
she isn't afraid

34:42.664 --> 34:43.916
to break the rules.

34:43.916 --> 34:44.958
I know.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.334
What?

34:46.334 --> 34:48.253
That's exactly

34:46.334 --> 34:48.253
what I was afraid of.

34:48.253 --> 34:49.922
She's making you

34:48.253 --> 34:49.922
not like your life.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.590
Suddenly you feel like

34:51.590 --> 34:53.258
you're married

34:51.590 --> 34:53.258
to some boring guy

34:53.258 --> 34:55.552
and we're just

34:53.258 --> 34:55.552
married boring people.

34:55.552 --> 34:56.511
Well, guess what.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.512
I'm not boring!

34:57.512 --> 34:58.513
I didn't say you were.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.598
Michael...

34:59.598 --> 35:01.224
What are you doing?

35:01.224 --> 35:02.601
Where are you go...?

35:01.224 --> 35:02.601
Michael, stop.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.692
( rock music playing

35:07.647 --> 35:10.692
over speakers )

35:10.692 --> 35:12.318
Jane!

35:12.318 --> 35:13.987
Hi! You're here.

35:12.318 --> 35:13.987
Alice. Hi.

35:13.987 --> 35:15.113
Let me introduce

35:13.987 --> 35:15.113
you to everyone.

MICHAEL:

35:15.113 --> 35:16.489
Everyone.

35:16.489 --> 35:17.699
Can I have your attention?

35:17.699 --> 35:19.451
So bear with me.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.119
I have to prove to my wife

35:19.451 --> 35:21.119
that I'm not boring.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.412
Oh, my God.

36:22.472 --> 36:23.807
Yes.

36:22.472 --> 36:23.807
( phone buzzes )

36:22.472 --> 36:23.807
Oh.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.058
Ha! It's Alice.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.058
What?

36:25.058 --> 36:26.559
Oh! They loved us!

36:26.559 --> 36:28.186
They want us to go back.

36:26.559 --> 36:28.186
Should we go back?

36:26.559 --> 36:28.186
No.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.604
You wanted Alice

36:28.186 --> 36:29.604
to think you're awesome.

36:29.604 --> 36:30.897
She thinks you're awesome.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.691
You got to leave them

36:30.897 --> 36:32.691
wanting more.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.359
That's how we roll.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.359
We go in there,

36:34.359 --> 36:35.735
we drop some fun

36:35.735 --> 36:36.903
And we're out.

36:40.157 --> 36:42.575
I did have fun tonight.

36:42.575 --> 36:43.910
And for the record,

36:43.910 --> 36:45.203
I don't want

36:43.910 --> 36:45.203
to be young and crazy

36:45.203 --> 36:46.872
with anyone else but you.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.373
Me neither.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.876
It's still pretty early.

36:50.876 --> 36:54.838
What other fun, spontaneous,

36:50.876 --> 36:54.838
crazy things should we do?

36:54.838 --> 36:56.339
We got a cat!

36:56.339 --> 36:58.257
( gasps )

36:56.339 --> 36:58.257
MICHAEL: Introducing

36:58.257 --> 36:59.968
Faith M. Whiskers III.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.928
We didn't even debate

36:59.968 --> 37:01.928
about it, we just did it!

37:01.928 --> 37:04.056
Wow, you guys are wild.

37:04.056 --> 37:05.348
I know!

37:04.056 --> 37:05.348
We really are.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.017
( laughing ):

37:05.348 --> 37:07.017
Uh, so...

37:07.017 --> 37:08.185
Listen.

37:08.185 --> 37:10.228
Rafael actually mentioned

37:10.228 --> 37:12.064
that he wanted to hang out.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.732
Really?

37:13.732 --> 37:15.734
Truly.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.734
You should do it.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.694
I mean, he's home;

37:15.734 --> 37:17.694
I know he would love to see you.

37:17.694 --> 37:19.905
I guess I should hop

37:17.694 --> 37:19.905
in the shower, then.

37:17.694 --> 37:19.905
Do it!

37:19.905 --> 37:21.990
Definitely.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.784
Nice work.

37:24.784 --> 37:25.952
( laughs )

37:25.952 --> 37:28.038
You think Faith M. Whiskers III

37:28.038 --> 37:31.791
has ever seen two boring

37:28.038 --> 37:31.791
married people have sex?

37:31.791 --> 37:33.752
Michael, ew.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.628
( laughing ):

37:33.752 --> 37:35.628
I don't want

37:33.752 --> 37:35.628
her watching us.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.089
Get out of here, Faith.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.089
( cat meows )

37:37.089 --> 37:38.840
( knocking on door )

37:38.840 --> 37:40.258
NARRATOR:

37:38.840 --> 37:40.258
<i>I bet I know who that is.</i>

37:40.258 --> 37:42.219
<i>Meow, indeed.</i>

37:43.469 --> 37:45.388
<i>Not who I expected.</i>

37:51.061 --> 37:52.729
I told you

37:51.061 --> 37:52.729
it would work.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.647
NARRATOR:

37:52.729 --> 37:54.647
<i>Let me explain.</i>

37:54.647 --> 37:58.193
We are never, ever

37:54.647 --> 37:58.193
getting back together.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.528
Ever.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.031
You don't have to throw our song

38:00.528 --> 38:03.031
in my face.

38:04.908 --> 38:08.536
So... who I was with...

38:04.908 --> 38:08.536
it was really Anezka?

38:08.536 --> 38:10.580
Yeah, but there's

38:08.536 --> 38:10.580
no way to prove it.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.624
And...

38:12.624 --> 38:14.126
you'll be getting that

38:12.624 --> 38:14.126
bonus, as discussed.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.835
Oh, I didn't do it

38:14.126 --> 38:15.835
for the money.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.712
No, though it's

38:15.835 --> 38:17.712
a pretty nice number.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.881
No, I did it for the favor.

38:19.881 --> 38:23.802
It's good to have

38:19.881 --> 38:23.802
a guy like you owe me.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.221
FEMALE DIRECTOR:

38:23.802 --> 38:26.221
<i>We just owe this last shot.</i>

38:26.221 --> 38:28.306
And action!

38:28.306 --> 38:30.349
( intense Latin theme playing )

38:42.779 --> 38:44.363
( in Spanish )

38:42.779 --> 38:44.363
Get me JFK.

38:44.363 --> 38:46.741
We need to have a talk

38:44.363 --> 38:46.741
about saving the world...

38:46.741 --> 38:48.326
over breakfast.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.628
DIRECTOR:

38:57.169 --> 38:58.628
Cut! Perfect.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.713
That's a wrap.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.007
That was fantastic!

39:02.007 --> 39:04.425
Everybody at

39:02.007 --> 39:04.425
the Honey Bunch is excited.

39:04.425 --> 39:05.969
Terrific! I'm excited, too.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.054
Last night, I had

39:05.969 --> 39:08.054
a moment of clarity.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.806
I want to have more children.

39:09.806 --> 39:11.308
That's my mission.

39:11.308 --> 39:12.809
And I'm going

39:11.308 --> 39:12.809
to make it happen.

39:12.809 --> 39:16.062
Would you be interested

39:12.809 --> 39:16.062
by any chance?

39:16.062 --> 39:18.397
( gentle theme playing )

39:18.397 --> 39:20.525
( laughing ):

39:18.397 --> 39:20.525
I'm just kidding!

39:20.525 --> 39:23.236
I love the cereal,

39:20.525 --> 39:23.236
but I need eggs.

39:23.236 --> 39:25.613
NARRATOR:

39:23.236 --> 39:25.613
<i>Speaking of sexy come-ons...</i>

39:25.613 --> 39:27.406
( knocking on door )

39:25.613 --> 39:27.406
<i>Okay, I'm pretty sure</i>

39:27.406 --> 39:29.117
<i>I'm right this time.</i>

39:30.785 --> 39:31.995
I was glad you called.

39:34.455 --> 39:36.499
( intense Latin theme playing )

39:40.461 --> 39:41.838
( moaning )

39:43.298 --> 39:44.883
ROGELIO:

39:43.298 --> 39:44.883
<i>And bang!</i>

39:44.883 --> 39:47.385
I nailed it on

39:44.883 --> 39:47.385
the very first take.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.928
Now, everybody, please

39:47.385 --> 39:48.928
try this cereal.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.430
It's everything.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.430
So...

39:51.430 --> 39:53.599
Have there been any more

39:51.430 --> 39:53.599
Bruce sightings?

39:53.599 --> 39:56.853
Nope, not since I, uh,

39:53.599 --> 39:56.853
told him off.

39:56.853 --> 39:59.147
JANE: Wow.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.899
So the spell is finally broken.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.067
It is.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.364
( in Spanish )

40:05.570 --> 40:07.364
Can we talk?

40:09.241 --> 40:11.450
I just wanted to tell you that

40:11.450 --> 40:13.995
I'm very sorry.

40:13.995 --> 40:17.249
I exploded with your cousin,

40:17.249 --> 40:19.959
but I did not know

40:17.249 --> 40:19.959
that my sister

40:19.959 --> 40:22.379
liked Mateo, and...

40:22.379 --> 40:23.963
and...

40:23.963 --> 40:25.464
No, Abuela...

40:25.464 --> 40:28.260
It's okay.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.469
I believe you.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.933
I feel distant from you.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.142
And I don't like it.

40:37.394 --> 40:38.937
Me, neither.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.272
So can we end this?

40:40.272 --> 40:41.606
I want to.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.233
Okay.

40:43.233 --> 40:44.817
( sighs )

40:44.817 --> 40:46.652
( Alba sighs )

40:47.904 --> 40:49.281
( sighs )

40:51.490 --> 40:53.285
But...

40:53.285 --> 40:56.413
I don't trust that cousin

40:53.285 --> 40:56.413
of yours, Jane.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.665
She reminds me of my sister.

40:59.665 --> 41:02.377
<i>A master-manipulator...</i>

41:02.377 --> 41:03.461
So how about

41:03.461 --> 41:05.422
I go get us

41:03.461 --> 41:05.422
something to eat

41:05.422 --> 41:08.507
and then we do that

41:05.422 --> 41:08.507
a few thousand more times?

41:09.968 --> 41:11.510
Sounds perfect.

41:18.768 --> 41:20.478
You are trouble,

41:18.768 --> 41:20.478
aren't you...?

41:20.478 --> 41:24.899
( laughs )

41:20.478 --> 41:24.899
I guess you'll have

41:20.478 --> 41:24.899
to wait and see.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.484
( instrumental theme flourish )

41:30.989 --> 41:34.242
( theme song playing )
