WEBVTT

00:25.172 --> 00:25.931
- Happy Friday.

00:34.551 --> 00:35.551
- You fell for it.

00:35.655 --> 00:36.827
You took Casual Friday too far.

00:36.931 --> 00:38.931
- What do you mean?
The email said we could wear

00:39.034 --> 00:39.896
whatever we want.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.137
- Matt,
you naive little ingenue.

00:41.241 --> 00:42.448
Casual Friday is a trap.

00:42.551 --> 00:45.137
Anything you wear can
and will be held against you.

00:45.241 --> 00:47.965
You know, this is the first time
I've ever seen your toes.

00:48.068 --> 00:50.241
There's something weird
about them.

00:50.344 --> 00:51.344
- I don't have weird toes.

00:51.448 --> 00:52.896
- Yes you do.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.344
They look like stretched out
baby fingers.

00:55.448 --> 00:56.896
- As much as I enjoy
seeing others fail,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.172
I'm gonna take pity on you
and give you my jacket.

01:01.758 --> 01:04.344
- Now he looks like
he's in a ska band.

01:04.448 --> 01:05.896
- I actually used to be
in a ska band.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.206
- Don't ever tell anybody that.

01:07.310 --> 01:11.000
- Great, now I look like
the biggest idiot in the office.

01:11.103 --> 01:11.724
- Hi, Tom.

01:11.827 --> 01:13.586
Jill, nice to see you.

01:13.689 --> 01:15.413
Terry, how's it going?

01:15.517 --> 01:17.586
Oh, nice outfit, Jennifer.

01:17.689 --> 01:18.862
Morning, Ken.

01:18.965 --> 01:20.793
Can you get the New York office

01:20.896 --> 01:23.103
on the phone for me, please?

01:27.758 --> 01:29.827
Anyone have any big plans
for the weekend?

01:52.586 --> 01:53.482
- Hey.
- Hmm?

01:53.586 --> 01:54.482
- Did you notice?

01:54.586 --> 01:56.517
Contacts.
- I did notice.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.068
Hey...

01:58.172 --> 01:59.034
these are real cheetah.

01:59.137 --> 01:59.758
- I could tell.

02:12.379 --> 02:13.655
♪ Hey-la

02:16.620 --> 02:17.965
- What the fuck is this?

02:18.068 --> 02:20.275
- Oh, well, sir, we have been
experiencing an uptick

02:20.379 --> 02:22.620
in reports of employee
depression and aggression.

02:22.724 --> 02:24.344
- So to address the issue,

02:24.448 --> 02:26.586
we implemented Casual Friday,

02:26.689 --> 02:29.448
where employees can wear jeans
once a month.

02:29.551 --> 02:32.482
- Well, that was
a catastrophic mistake.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.827
Just look at that.

02:33.931 --> 02:37.620
I mean, how can someone
lack the shame and dignity

02:37.724 --> 02:39.517
to come into an office
looking like that?

02:39.620 --> 02:41.448
To put on those clothes

02:41.551 --> 02:43.655
and stroll
into a place of business

02:43.758 --> 02:45.172
and think that
that's an acceptable way

02:45.275 --> 02:46.344
to live your life?

02:46.448 --> 02:47.827
- We probably shouldn't tell him
our best lawyer

02:47.931 --> 02:49.827
went insane
and came in shirtless today.

02:49.931 --> 02:51.965
- And what is going on
with those toes?

02:52.068 --> 02:54.413
The second one is too long.
It should be covered.

02:54.517 --> 02:56.310
Why would he subject us to this?

02:56.413 --> 02:58.827
I don't want to see
another human being's foot

02:58.931 --> 03:00.827
for the rest of the day.

03:00.931 --> 03:04.137
- Wow. This is definitely gonna
be a traumatic memory for me.

03:04.241 --> 03:06.862
- Alyssa Armstrong is going to
be here within the hour,

03:06.965 --> 03:10.034
and she represents
Glorious Salvation Ministries,

03:10.137 --> 03:13.206
the largest group
of mega-churches in the country,

03:13.310 --> 03:15.206
and this meeting
was not easy to get.

03:15.310 --> 03:16.206
Oh, no, no, no, no.

03:16.310 --> 03:18.655
I had to buy three

03:18.758 --> 03:21.000
of George W. Bush's
dog paintings

03:21.103 --> 03:22.206
to get him to vouch for me.

03:23.724 --> 03:27.551
- Now, we all know
there's no God,

03:27.655 --> 03:30.620
but there is...

03:30.724 --> 03:33.827
a ton of money
to be made in his name.

03:33.931 --> 03:36.620
So let's try to act
like professionals today.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.862
- And, John...

03:40.965 --> 03:42.551
put your glasses back on.

03:42.655 --> 03:45.206
You look like
a prepubescent Voldemort.

03:45.310 --> 03:46.310
- Thank you, sir.

03:46.413 --> 03:48.103
- John and I need to hop
into this meeting,

03:48.206 --> 03:49.896
so we need you
to talk to the man

03:50.000 --> 03:50.793
who came in
without his shirt on.

03:50.896 --> 03:53.586
- His name is Walter Sabo.

03:53.689 --> 03:55.586
He's the top litigator
at Hampton DeVille

03:55.689 --> 03:56.965
and one of the best
in the country.

03:57.068 --> 03:59.103
- And judging by your inability
to dress yourself,

03:59.206 --> 04:00.965
we thought you might be able
to get through to him.

04:01.068 --> 04:03.413
-  Okay, I'll do it.

04:03.517 --> 04:04.793
Thanks for believing in me.

04:04.896 --> 04:06.413
- Don't worry, I'll keep him
on a short leash.

04:06.517 --> 04:07.482
- What do we think?

04:07.586 --> 04:09.586
- You look like a priest.

04:09.689 --> 04:10.758
- Well, that's what
I'm going for.

04:10.862 --> 04:12.482
- Well, it's too much.
- Okay.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.034
Too much.

04:14.137 --> 04:15.620
- When did you
stop believing in God?

04:15.724 --> 04:16.758
- I was 12.

04:16.862 --> 04:18.724
I drank some of the holy water
at church,

04:18.827 --> 04:20.068
and it gave me salmonella.
- Hmm.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.655
- Uh, what made you
stop believing in God?

04:21.758 --> 04:23.000
- YouTube comments.

04:23.103 --> 04:25.758
- Who are the 90% of people
who still believe in God?

04:25.862 --> 04:27.068
- Professional athletes.
They're rich, hot,

04:27.172 --> 04:28.551
and their bodies
haven't betrayed them yet.

04:28.655 --> 04:29.724
Their lives are amazing.

04:29.827 --> 04:31.448
Why wouldn't they
believe in God?

04:31.551 --> 04:32.724
- We need to speak to Walter.

04:32.827 --> 04:35.655
- Okay, but you know
he's not wearing a shirt, right?

04:35.758 --> 04:37.068
- Yeah, that's why we're here.

04:37.172 --> 04:38.586
- Am I gonna lose my job?

04:38.689 --> 04:40.241
I have student loans.

04:40.344 --> 04:41.413
- No, no.

04:41.517 --> 04:44.275
I mean, I guess I don't know,
but probably not.

04:44.379 --> 04:47.206
- Listen, why don't we
finish this conversation

04:47.310 --> 04:49.793
when I beat you
on the golf course this Sunday?

04:51.896 --> 04:53.068
Sounds good.

04:53.172 --> 04:54.586
Send those contracts over,

04:54.689 --> 04:55.413
and I'll take a look
at them today.

04:55.517 --> 04:58.551
All right. Ciao.

04:58.655 --> 04:59.965
How can I help you boys?

05:00.068 --> 05:02.551
- Walter, we're here to talk
to you about your shirt.

05:02.655 --> 05:03.758
- I'm not wearing a shirt.

05:03.862 --> 05:05.862
- Exactly. That's the problem.

05:05.965 --> 05:07.586
- Why is that a problem?

05:07.689 --> 05:08.620
Today is Casual Friday.

05:08.724 --> 05:09.862
- We're aware of that,

05:09.965 --> 05:11.586
but that doesn't mean
you can be shirtless.

05:11.689 --> 05:13.241
- Actually, it does.

05:13.344 --> 05:15.896
The official Casual Friday memo

05:16.000 --> 05:18.965
says the dress code
is "loosened."

05:19.068 --> 05:20.517
However, in the entire document,

05:20.620 --> 05:23.034
there's no stated definition
of the word "loosened."

05:23.137 --> 05:24.896
Therefore, "loosened" is open

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
to individual interpretation.

05:26.103 --> 05:29.931
My interpretation
is not wearing a shirt.

05:30.034 --> 05:31.482
Right, but it's distracting

05:31.586 --> 05:33.551
to the other employees.

05:34.758 --> 05:35.793
- Why?

05:35.896 --> 05:37.379
- Because they can see
your nipples.

05:37.482 --> 05:39.655
- Are you saying there's
something wrong with my nipples?

05:39.758 --> 05:41.275
- No, your--
your nipples are great.

05:41.379 --> 05:43.000
- It's just that
in the workplace,

05:43.103 --> 05:44.862
nipples are problems.

05:44.965 --> 05:46.068
- I disagree,

05:46.172 --> 05:48.586
and the burden is on you
to prove me wrong.

05:48.689 --> 05:49.689
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:49.793 --> 05:52.034
my nipples and I
have some work to do.

05:53.965 --> 05:57.551
- ♪ While by my sheep

05:57.655 --> 06:02.482
♪ I watched at night

06:02.586 --> 06:05.655
- Remember, God is real.

06:05.758 --> 06:07.137
Alyssa,

06:07.241 --> 06:09.517
how nice to finally meet you.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.068
- Hello, Mr. Devil.

06:11.172 --> 06:13.206
- It's pronounced DeVille.

06:13.310 --> 06:16.517
But please, call me Christian.

06:18.793 --> 06:19.689
- I have to be honest,

06:19.793 --> 06:21.448
I was a little hesitant

06:21.551 --> 06:24.137
about meeting with you today,
but, um...

06:24.241 --> 06:26.000
I can see that Hampton DeVille

06:26.103 --> 06:28.448
is serious
about working with us.

06:28.551 --> 06:31.000
However,
I am finding the choir music

06:31.103 --> 06:32.620
somewhat distracting.

06:33.827 --> 06:34.758
- Down or off?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.482
- Maybe just off.
- Just off?

06:39.965 --> 06:43.310
- Well, let's get into terms.

06:43.413 --> 06:46.482
- Okay, Walter has clearly
lost his mind.

06:46.586 --> 06:48.517
But if you think about it,

06:48.620 --> 06:50.034
why are we wearing shirts?

06:50.137 --> 06:52.620
Like, why are you
wearing that shirt?

06:52.724 --> 06:53.862
- Because I look great in it.

06:53.965 --> 06:56.172
- Right, okay,
but beyond that,

06:56.275 --> 06:58.344
why are you covering your body
in clothing?

06:58.448 --> 06:59.482
- Because I'm ashamed
of my body.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.620
- Okay, right, but maybe

07:02.724 --> 07:04.172
if we didn't wear clothes,

07:04.275 --> 07:05.413
there wouldn't be body shame.

07:05.517 --> 07:06.827
- Maybe body shaming
is underrated.

07:06.931 --> 07:08.000
- What's going on?

07:08.103 --> 07:09.413
Does Walter still
have his shirt off?

07:09.517 --> 07:12.137
- The Walter situation
is under control.

07:12.241 --> 07:14.137
- Ken, I need the Smith files
when you get a chance.

07:14.241 --> 07:15.517
Thanks, buddy.

07:16.931 --> 07:18.482
- Yeah, but he still
has his shirt off.

07:18.586 --> 07:20.034
- Well, yes.

07:20.137 --> 07:22.034
But he's still doing his job.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.379
- So if I took my shirt off,

07:24.482 --> 07:26.068
you guys wouldn't
do anything about it?

07:26.172 --> 07:28.137
- Who's to say what we would do?

07:29.620 --> 07:31.068
No. Very bad.

07:31.172 --> 07:32.827
You're being
an unbelievably bad boy.

07:32.931 --> 07:34.931
Stop it.
You're the baddest boy.

07:35.034 --> 07:36.689
I would love for you to stop.
I'll pay you a lot of money.

07:36.793 --> 07:38.344
- Please don't do that.

07:38.448 --> 07:39.586
Okay, fine,

07:39.689 --> 07:42.206
but nobody else
take their shirt off, all right?

07:42.310 --> 07:44.344
I mean, Paige,
obviously you can't.

07:44.448 --> 07:46.758
- Uh, wait, what does that mean?

07:46.862 --> 07:49.827
- Well, you're a woman, so...

07:49.931 --> 07:51.586
- So what?

07:51.689 --> 07:53.344
If you're a guy,
you could take off your shirt,

07:53.448 --> 07:55.862
but if you're woman,
you can't?

07:55.965 --> 07:57.551
That's sexist.

07:58.620 --> 07:59.413
- Okay.

07:59.517 --> 08:02.034
Um, I know that since I'm a man,

08:02.137 --> 08:05.379
telling you what is
or isn't sexist

08:05.482 --> 08:06.793
is sexist.

08:06.896 --> 08:09.000
But you can't take off
your shirt.

08:09.103 --> 08:10.689
Because you're a woman.

08:10.793 --> 08:13.482
But we're not sexist.

08:13.586 --> 08:14.482
- Oh.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.965
- Okay, that's fair.

08:20.068 --> 08:21.344
And I'm sorry.

08:21.448 --> 08:22.620
- Hey, these executives say

08:22.724 --> 08:25.068
we can all take our shirts off.
- No, we didn't.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.448
It's against the rules
to have your shirt off!

08:26.551 --> 08:27.482
- Shirts off!

08:27.586 --> 08:28.586
- And there will be
repercussions.

08:28.689 --> 08:30.310
We just don't know
what they are yet.

08:30.413 --> 08:31.724
But we're figuring that out!

08:36.689 --> 08:37.655
- As you can see,

08:37.758 --> 08:39.206
Hampton DeVille
has the ability

08:39.310 --> 08:41.482
to bring your churches
into the 21st century.

08:41.586 --> 08:44.724
Our flat screens will broadcast
the gospel of Jesus

08:44.827 --> 08:46.862
in 4K resolution.

08:46.965 --> 08:48.413
We want to help you create

08:48.517 --> 08:51.827
an immersive religious
entertainment experience.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.931
And if somehow
your congregants

08:54.034 --> 08:55.793
manage to lose interest,

08:55.896 --> 08:58.137
you can wake them up with...

09:00.689 --> 09:01.344
The touch of God.

09:04.793 --> 09:06.931
- So what do you say?

09:07.034 --> 09:08.551
Shall we...

09:08.655 --> 09:10.172
consummate this holy union?

09:10.275 --> 09:14.586
- What you have presented
here today

09:14.689 --> 09:18.103
is blasphemy.

09:18.206 --> 09:19.344
You want me to pay
millions of dollars

09:19.448 --> 09:23.000
so you can splatter
your corporate logo

09:23.103 --> 09:25.034
across my church?

09:25.137 --> 09:26.724
Well, I have a counteroffer.

09:31.655 --> 09:32.758
$1.

09:32.862 --> 09:34.689
That's how much
I'm willing to pay you.

09:34.793 --> 09:37.206
Now, the question is...
- You can kill it now.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.758
- Are you smart enough
to say yes?

09:39.862 --> 09:41.517
- You have my attention.

09:41.620 --> 09:44.310
- Never in the 6,000-year-old
history of the world

09:44.413 --> 09:45.586
has a corporation been offered

09:45.689 --> 09:48.793
a product placement opportunity
like this.

09:48.896 --> 09:50.965
Every time my congregants
go to pray,

09:51.068 --> 09:54.310
they'll be thinking
of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit,

09:54.413 --> 09:56.827
and Hampton fucking DeVille.

09:56.931 --> 10:00.413
So you all are going
to supply my churches,

10:00.517 --> 10:03.586
and I'm going
to pay you nothing.

10:03.689 --> 10:06.206
And you are going to thank God

10:06.310 --> 10:09.172
for the gift I have given
unto you.

10:11.793 --> 10:13.241
- God damn.

10:13.344 --> 10:15.862
- Do not use the Lord's name
in vain though.

10:17.586 --> 10:18.793
- Thanks to you guys,
there are now

10:18.896 --> 10:20.275
25 shirtless people
in this building.

10:20.379 --> 10:24.068
- And yet all of them look
less ridiculous than Matt.

10:24.172 --> 10:25.344
- Why are you attacking me
right now?

10:25.448 --> 10:27.241
- I was going to leave early
to go see Pitbull,

10:27.344 --> 10:29.551
but at this rate,
I won't be able to.

10:29.655 --> 10:30.862
I had to forgive my father
for those tickets.

10:30.965 --> 10:32.206
- I don't blame people
for taking their shirts off.

10:32.310 --> 10:33.517
They're just
desperately grasping

10:33.620 --> 10:34.862
for any sort of identity,

10:34.965 --> 10:36.206
and I can relate to that.

10:36.310 --> 10:37.344
- You're wrong.
- Guys!

10:37.448 --> 10:38.862
We need to talk to these people

10:38.965 --> 10:40.620
and figure out how
to get their shirts back on

10:40.724 --> 10:42.137
so I can be baptized
in the sweat

10:42.241 --> 10:43.655
of my one true god,

10:43.758 --> 10:45.137
Pitbull.

10:45.241 --> 10:47.655
So why aren't you wearing
your shirt?

10:47.758 --> 10:50.000
- If they want to tell me
what to wear so badly,

10:50.103 --> 10:52.724
maybe they should try paying
for my health benefits first.

10:52.827 --> 10:54.655
- Corporations are fascist,
okay?

10:54.758 --> 10:57.068
I don't buy in
to your puritanical dress code.

10:57.172 --> 10:58.137
- You know who else tried

10:58.241 --> 11:00.517
to enforce dress codes?
Hitler.

11:00.620 --> 11:02.793
- Honestly, I just started
doing this as a joke, but...

11:02.896 --> 11:04.413
I mean now,
I'm pretty serious about it.

11:04.517 --> 11:05.758
- I'm just a janitor here,
so I don't really

11:05.862 --> 11:07.448
get treated like
the other employees.

11:07.551 --> 11:09.034
It just feels good
to be a part of something.

11:09.137 --> 11:10.275
- Monkeys don't wear shirts.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.620
Right? We're all monkeys.

11:11.724 --> 11:13.689
- Walter's standing up
for all of us.

11:13.793 --> 11:15.862
- I think Walter's
an honest-to-God prophet.

11:15.965 --> 11:17.344
- I think Walter's hot.

11:17.448 --> 11:19.620
- Donkeys also
don't wear shirts,

11:19.724 --> 11:21.034
so, uh...

11:21.137 --> 11:22.965
think about that.

11:23.068 --> 11:24.172
- So, Brock...

11:25.482 --> 11:27.275
Why did you take your shirt off?

11:27.379 --> 11:28.758
- I think Walter's right.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.379
There's way too many
restrictions

11:30.482 --> 11:31.827
on our bodies here at work.

11:31.931 --> 11:33.482
If people don't
want to wear a shirt,

11:33.586 --> 11:35.000
they shouldn't have to.

11:35.103 --> 11:36.620
I kinda feel like anybody

11:36.724 --> 11:38.931
should be able to do
whatever they want to do,

11:39.034 --> 11:40.034
all the time.

11:40.137 --> 11:41.482
♪ Hey-la

11:41.586 --> 11:42.517
- I found Brock
quite persuasive.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.517
- I think he made
some great points.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.517
- I implicitly trust him,

11:45.620 --> 11:47.655
and I want to be his friend.

11:47.758 --> 11:48.827
- I'm not gonna force
my fellowship

11:48.931 --> 11:51.137
to look at ads for
Hampton DeVille's vodka brand

11:51.241 --> 11:53.724
every time they turn
to 1 Corinthians.

11:53.827 --> 11:55.310
- Well, unless
you're willing to leave

11:55.413 --> 11:56.379
the future of your company--

11:56.482 --> 11:57.344
I'm sorry, "church"--

11:57.448 --> 11:59.862
up to God's good will,

11:59.965 --> 12:01.689
you're going to have to make
some compromises.

12:01.793 --> 12:04.034
You can't have free porn
without pop-ups.

12:04.137 --> 12:06.275
- My congregation doesn't listen
to pop-up ads.

12:06.379 --> 12:07.862
They listen to me.

12:07.965 --> 12:09.551
When I told them
to burn "Harry Potter,"

12:09.655 --> 12:12.206
sales of the book went up 40%.

12:12.310 --> 12:14.137
JK Rowling still owes me
for that.

12:14.241 --> 12:16.413
- Okay, how about this?

12:16.517 --> 12:17.758
We'll disable the ads,

12:17.862 --> 12:19.551
but in exchange,

12:19.655 --> 12:21.689
I want all
your refreshment stands

12:21.793 --> 12:23.413
to be stocked exclusively

12:23.517 --> 12:26.137
with Hampton DeVille
food products.

12:26.241 --> 12:28.137
- We're thinking...

12:28.241 --> 12:29.551
Crossicles.

12:39.586 --> 12:42.000
- My favorite flavor:

12:42.103 --> 12:43.620
the blood of Christ.

12:45.689 --> 12:46.827
- Go grab the champagne.

12:46.931 --> 12:48.655
We'll have a deal by the time
you get back.

12:50.344 --> 12:53.137
- Christian is
a master negotiator.

12:53.241 --> 12:56.103
- We might even get out of here
in time to see Pitbull.

13:04.137 --> 13:07.689
- ♪ Satan is real

13:07.793 --> 13:10.620
♪ Working in spirit

13:10.724 --> 13:13.344
♪ You can see him
and hear him ♪

13:13.448 --> 13:18.137
♪ In this world every day

13:18.241 --> 13:21.758
♪ Satan is real

13:21.862 --> 13:24.655
♪ Working with power

13:24.758 --> 13:26.724
♪ He can tempt you

13:26.827 --> 13:29.655
♪ And lead you astray

13:34.586 --> 13:35.931
- It's like fucking
Armageddon out there.

13:36.034 --> 13:37.586
- I haven't seen
this many bare torsos

13:37.689 --> 13:38.896
since that spring break

13:39.000 --> 13:40.448
I got trapped
in that mannequin factory.

13:40.551 --> 13:41.931
- We think it has something
to do with Walter.

13:42.034 --> 13:43.586
- He started some kind
of movement.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.413
- How could one employee
taking his shirt off

13:45.517 --> 13:46.482
lead to this?

13:46.586 --> 13:48.655
- I might be able to explain.

13:48.758 --> 13:51.655
You need to think of this
as a riot.

13:51.758 --> 13:52.896
Now, during a riot,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.310
people do things
that they don't normally do,

13:55.413 --> 13:57.137
things that don't make sense.

13:57.241 --> 13:59.379
It starts with one person

13:59.482 --> 14:00.517
throwing a brick
through a window,

14:00.620 --> 14:02.586
or in this case,
taking their shirt off.

14:02.689 --> 14:05.724
This person is a radical.

14:05.827 --> 14:08.724
They don't need anyone
to model their behavior after.

14:08.827 --> 14:10.724
Then a second person comes.

14:10.827 --> 14:13.103
Usually this person wouldn't
take their shirt off,

14:13.206 --> 14:15.517
but since someone else
has done it first,

14:15.620 --> 14:17.103
they go along for the ride.

14:17.206 --> 14:20.413
Then a third person
and fourth person and so on.

14:20.517 --> 14:23.655
It's very simple
crowd psychology.

14:23.758 --> 14:25.413
Once enough people participate,

14:25.517 --> 14:27.793
there are no
social consequences.

14:27.896 --> 14:30.206
It's like how everyone
in the '90s

14:30.310 --> 14:32.551
started listening to ska.

14:32.655 --> 14:35.931
This guy knows
what I'm talking about.

14:36.034 --> 14:38.413
- So how do we get people to
stop taking their shirts off?

14:38.517 --> 14:40.068
- There's no stopping it.

14:40.172 --> 14:43.137
Eventually,
we'll all be shirtless.

14:46.275 --> 14:47.965
- Okay.

14:48.068 --> 14:49.620
- John and I
will handle Christian.

14:49.724 --> 14:53.827
You two better fix this or I
will crucify you myself.

14:58.034 --> 15:00.586
- Turn the AC down
to 53 degrees.

15:00.689 --> 15:02.172
Yes I am powerful enough
to tell you to do that.

15:02.275 --> 15:03.586
Now do it.

15:03.689 --> 15:05.000
- Okay, Ken, we'll be there
in just a minute.

15:05.103 --> 15:07.620
No, you don't have to
turn tricks to make rent.

15:07.724 --> 15:09.344
Just drive Lyft or something.

15:12.103 --> 15:13.517
- She caved.
We've got a deal.

15:13.620 --> 15:17.413
- Sir, first I just want to say
that watching you negotiate this

15:17.517 --> 15:19.482
has been a privilege.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.310
- Quick update slash
minor hiccup:

15:21.413 --> 15:22.758
half the employees have taken
their shirts off

15:22.862 --> 15:25.655
and are refusing
to put them back on.

15:26.724 --> 15:28.034
- What?

15:35.827 --> 15:38.482
Jesus Christ.

15:38.586 --> 15:39.758
I'll handle Alyssa.

15:39.862 --> 15:42.034
You two deal with
the rest of the company

15:42.137 --> 15:45.206
or I swear to God
I will crucify you myself.

15:47.310 --> 15:48.448
Let's celebrate.

15:48.551 --> 15:49.793
- We want to talk to Walter!

15:49.896 --> 15:51.000
- He's the only one
who understands us!

15:51.103 --> 15:52.413
- Let him out of his office!

15:52.517 --> 15:54.448
- I'm not keeping him in there!
I'm just his assistant!

15:54.551 --> 15:57.000
What do you want me to do?
Suck all your dicks for money?

15:57.103 --> 15:58.655
- What?
- What did he say?

15:58.758 --> 15:59.827
- Oh, God, thank God
you're here.

15:59.931 --> 16:02.551
- Why do those guys
get to see Walter?

16:02.655 --> 16:03.551
They don't even
have their shirts off!

16:03.655 --> 16:06.275
- And say hello to Linda for me.

16:06.379 --> 16:07.586
Really?

16:07.689 --> 16:09.620
Oh, well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

16:09.724 --> 16:10.758
Then don't say hi to her
for me.

16:12.068 --> 16:14.310
All right.
I'll talk to you later.

16:14.413 --> 16:16.310
Ciao.

16:16.413 --> 16:17.655
Can we make this quick?

16:17.758 --> 16:19.034
I've got work to do, and you
boys keep interrupting me.

16:19.137 --> 16:21.448
- Walter, half the company
has their shirts off

16:21.551 --> 16:23.310
and Christian will probably
clean house if he finds out,

16:23.413 --> 16:25.068
all because you refuse
to put your shirt back on.

16:25.172 --> 16:26.103
- Hasn't this gone far enough?

16:26.206 --> 16:28.206
- Hey, all I did is find
a loophole.

16:28.310 --> 16:30.344
It's not my fault everyone
followed me through it.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.482
- Yes, it is.

16:31.586 --> 16:33.517
- Well, we disagree.

16:35.758 --> 16:37.034
- Arguing with him is pointless.

16:37.137 --> 16:38.275
- What are we gonna do?

16:41.413 --> 16:42.379
Okay.

16:50.793 --> 16:54.931
Thank you for the champagne,
but I should really get going.

16:55.034 --> 16:56.758
- Oh, come on,
have another glass.

16:56.862 --> 16:58.827
We still need to finish
this puzzle.

16:58.931 --> 17:01.931
- Well--no.
Two glasses are fine for me.

17:02.034 --> 17:02.827
Everything in moderation.

17:02.931 --> 17:04.689
- Wait, you can't leave.

17:04.793 --> 17:05.620
I mean...

17:05.724 --> 17:08.965
Not before we pray

17:09.068 --> 17:12.448
to bless the deal.

17:12.551 --> 17:14.379
- Okay, fine.

17:14.482 --> 17:15.793
- Great news, everybody:

17:15.896 --> 17:18.172
Walter has asked us
to be his representatives.

17:18.275 --> 17:19.724
Now, what Walter
wants to know...

17:19.827 --> 17:20.896
- And, again,
these are Walter's words.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.413
Directly from the man himself.

17:22.517 --> 17:27.137
- What do we want in exchange
for putting our shirts back on?

17:27.241 --> 17:29.862
- We want equal treatment
for male and female employees!

17:29.965 --> 17:32.068
- Make it stop freezing in here!

17:32.172 --> 17:34.896
- No more unpaid overtime
and longer lunch breaks

17:35.000 --> 17:36.310
and better snacks
in the break room!

17:36.413 --> 17:37.517
- Yeah, better snacks!

17:37.620 --> 17:38.689
- Guys, if we want
upper management to listen,

17:38.793 --> 17:39.965
we have to be clear
about what we want.

17:40.068 --> 17:41.000
We're losing focus.

17:41.103 --> 17:41.862
- Fuck focus.
Fuck you.

17:41.965 --> 17:43.448
Shave your back!

17:43.551 --> 17:45.068
- Hey.
- No compromise.

17:45.172 --> 17:47.517
We should be able to
have our shirts off every day!

17:47.620 --> 17:49.689
- I mean, maybe not every day,
but once a week!

17:49.793 --> 17:50.827
- No!
Every day!

17:50.931 --> 17:52.137
Which side are you on?

18:09.310 --> 18:10.206
- I know there's been
a lot of controversy

18:10.310 --> 18:13.206
about me not wearing
a shirt today,

18:13.310 --> 18:17.068
but I believe that people
should have the freedom

18:17.172 --> 18:19.586
to wear whatever they want
to work.

18:19.689 --> 18:20.517
all: Yeah!

18:22.000 --> 18:24.965
- We've allowed our lives
to be dictated

18:25.068 --> 18:29.413
by arbitrary man-made rules.

18:29.517 --> 18:34.413
I believe we are perfect
the way God made us.

18:34.517 --> 18:35.448
all: Yeah!

18:35.551 --> 18:36.620
- Nice!

18:36.724 --> 18:38.586
That's what I'm talking about.

18:38.689 --> 18:40.517
- And in the spirit
of that...

18:54.793 --> 18:57.310
This is the real me.

18:57.413 --> 18:59.068
This is what freedom looks like.

19:00.241 --> 19:02.206
- I don't wanna take
my pants off.

19:02.310 --> 19:03.241
- Hey!

19:04.241 --> 19:06.448
Somebody took a shit
in my office!

19:07.827 --> 19:08.862
- All right, that's it.

19:08.965 --> 19:11.000
Everybody put your shirts
back on, okay?

19:11.103 --> 19:13.275
Honestly, it has not been
that fun.

19:13.379 --> 19:15.758
- Thank you for your guidance
in our negotiation

19:15.862 --> 19:17.517
over brand integration.

19:17.620 --> 19:20.448
You are the shepherd,
the sheep, and the wolf,

19:20.551 --> 19:22.931
and we are
Little Red Riding Hoods.

19:23.034 --> 19:24.103
- Forgive me,
oh, heavenly father,

19:24.206 --> 19:26.103
for not praying to you
for 15 years

19:26.206 --> 19:27.620
while I got my career on track.

19:27.724 --> 19:29.241
- Dear God, make me a drone

19:29.344 --> 19:31.275
so I can fly far, far, far away
from here.

19:31.379 --> 19:32.620
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, guys.

19:32.724 --> 19:33.931
- It's freezing in here!
- Playtime's over.

19:34.034 --> 19:35.655
- Remember Walter's
horrific penis?

19:35.758 --> 19:37.034
Get those shirts on!

19:41.827 --> 19:44.827
- And heavenly father,
thank you for, um...

19:44.931 --> 19:47.448
digitized stock trading,
and, uh...

19:47.551 --> 19:50.344
oh, oh, the benefits
accrued therein.

19:50.448 --> 19:53.206
And, father--what am
I thinking about now?

19:53.310 --> 19:54.551
Oh, yes, it's kinda like when,
you know, um--

19:54.655 --> 19:56.827
- Okay, amen.

19:56.931 --> 19:58.068
I'm cold.

19:58.172 --> 20:00.000
I feel like you prayed us
into Christmas.

20:00.103 --> 20:03.448
You know--

20:03.551 --> 20:05.310

20:21.931 --> 20:23.551
- I knew God was real.

20:23.655 --> 20:25.586
- Well, thank you for believing
in Hampton DeVille.

20:25.689 --> 20:26.758

God made a mistake
when he made those toes.

20:42.206 --> 20:44.551
Straight from
the depths of hell,

20:44.655 --> 20:49.068
those are
the hooves of Lucifer.

we all know there's no God,
but...

21:19.482 --> 21:24.379
there is a ton of money
to be made in his name.

21:24.482 --> 21:26.689
So let's try to act
like professionals today.

21:26.793 --> 21:27.620
- Okay, that's enough.
