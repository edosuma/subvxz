00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:04.460 --> 00:05.960
Previously...

00:05.960 --> 00:09.420
I have been waiting
a long time to meet you, KC.

00:09.420 --> 00:11.710
I was once very fond
of your parents,

00:11.710 --> 00:13.540
but their love and marriage
made me go a little...

00:13.540 --> 00:17.040
- what's the word I'm looking for?
- Insane?

00:17.040 --> 00:20.500
I'm going to take away
everything your parents love.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.920
starting with you and ending
with the Organization.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.290
"Hello, KC, if you're
reading this,

00:26.290 --> 00:28.120
then I have
successfully escaped."

00:28.120 --> 00:29.830
Zane's out there.

00:29.830 --> 00:33.080
He hates my family
more than ever,

00:33.080 --> 00:34.250
and it's my fault.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.710
KIRA: Look, Marisa!

00:36.710 --> 00:39.040
Yes! Marisa came
to save us!

00:39.040 --> 00:40.290
Wait, Marisa came
to save us?

00:40.290 --> 00:42.880
How did Marisa know
we needed saving?

00:42.880 --> 00:46.710
( sings high operatic note )

00:46.710 --> 00:48.670
Amazing!

00:48.670 --> 00:50.250
What's going on in here?

00:57.830 --> 01:00.460
You're sure
Richard was captured?

01:00.460 --> 01:03.080
So who's now in charge
of the Other Side?

01:03.080 --> 01:05.500
( evil chuckle )

01:05.500 --> 01:08.540
I was hoping
you'd say that.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.290
Looks like I'm going home.

01:14.250 --> 01:17.540
I'll see you soon, KC.

01:33.210 --> 01:36.420
No one's upstairs.
They're all gone.

01:37.830 --> 01:40.250
They must've been
tipped off.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.420
Where are the Coopers?!

01:44.620 --> 01:46.460
Everything is gonna
be all right.

01:46.460 --> 01:48.420
Your mother's on the phone
with the Organization,

01:48.420 --> 01:50.290
and I'm sure they'll come up with
a plan to keep us safe from Zane.

01:50.290 --> 01:52.380
Hopefully it's more thought-out
than the last plan,

01:52.380 --> 01:54.500
which was just
a phone call saying,

01:54.500 --> 01:57.250
"Zane's at your front door,
Run, run now!"

01:57.250 --> 02:00.250
( loud yawn )

02:00.250 --> 02:02.420
Ugh, what flavor
is your mouthwash?

02:02.420 --> 02:05.290
Hot garbage?

02:05.290 --> 02:08.460
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't have
time for proper dental hygiene.

02:08.460 --> 02:11.080
Up until ten minutes ago,
I was fast asleep.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.670
Believe me, I wish
we could've left you behind.

02:13.670 --> 02:15.670
In fact, I put it
to a vote.

02:15.670 --> 02:18.170
I lost.

02:18.170 --> 02:20.540
If it makes you feel any
better, it was close.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.330
No, that does not
make me feel better.

02:22.330 --> 02:24.500
That makes me
feel worse.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.330
Look, Zane knows
where you live,

02:26.330 --> 02:28.750
and none of us are safe
until he's captured.

02:28.750 --> 02:31.620
Okay, but my parents might
start to wonder where I am.

02:31.620 --> 02:35.500
So what I'm hearing is we got a
couple weeks to get you back home.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.080
All right, guys, we are gonna
be disappearing for a while.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.830
The Organization
is sending us to--

02:39.830 --> 02:43.290
A castle, a castle.
Please say a castle.

02:43.290 --> 02:47.620
Yes, a castle, where you'll be
named prince of Dorkylvania.

02:47.620 --> 02:51.210
Actually, we're going to
a safe house in Rio de Janeiro.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.460
Rio de Janeiro.

02:53.460 --> 02:57.120
That means
rio of the day.

02:58.420 --> 03:01.380
That's not even close.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.710
( gunshot )

03:03.710 --> 03:04.960
But that was.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.210
( gunshot )

03:06.210 --> 03:09.790
Okay, eat lasers,
henchmen.

Hey!

04:26.170 --> 04:28.330
What do you think
you're doing?

04:28.330 --> 04:30.460
- Get away from there.
- I'm bored.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.460
We haven't been out of
this apartment for two weeks.

04:32.460 --> 04:35.080
Well, you barely left our house
for the past 16 years,

04:35.080 --> 04:37.500
so you should be
used to it.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.830
Ernie, a little bit
of boredom is better

04:39.830 --> 04:42.330
than a lot of
getting shot at.

04:42.330 --> 04:44.170
I'd rather dodge
laser fire

04:44.170 --> 04:46.540
than listen to KC
snoring all night.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.330
It's even louder
than Mom's snoring.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.460
How did I
get dragged into this?

04:50.460 --> 04:53.500
Well, my snoring's better than
hearing you cry in your sleep.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.040
Those are tears of joy because
I don't have to listen to

04:56.040 --> 04:58.670
- the sound of your voice.
- ( both arguing )

04:58.670 --> 05:01.000
CRAIG: Hey, you two.
Don't make me come out there.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.040
- See, look what you did.
- ( arguing continues )

05:03.040 --> 05:06.710
Stop bickering!

05:06.710 --> 05:09.920
And be happy we're all together
in a safe place.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.290
What else
do we really need?

05:11.290 --> 05:13.790
I'm gonna go with
a door.

05:16.290 --> 05:19.750
Okay, when I am bored,
I count hair strands.

05:19.750 --> 05:22.250
I am up to 5,083.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.420
Or was it 5,084?

05:24.420 --> 05:25.880
Ugh, now I have to
start over.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.420
One, two, three...

05:29.420 --> 05:31.620
That's it.
I'm shaving her head!

05:31.620 --> 05:33.500
ALL: No, no!

05:33.500 --> 05:35.250
Hey, hey, hey!

05:35.250 --> 05:37.250
The whole point of us
hiding from Zane

05:37.250 --> 05:40.960
is to stay safe, so can we
please not kill each other?

05:40.960 --> 05:43.750
Craig, look, it's been a week since we
last had contact with the Organization.

05:43.750 --> 05:47.290
I mean, maybe they caught
Zane by now and we can go home.

05:47.290 --> 05:49.380
Let's go to the dead drop
and see if we can get an update.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.920
That's a good idea. I'm gonna go
'cause I need to get outta here.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.290
That's not fair.
I wanna go.

05:53.290 --> 05:55.460
I'm gonna go
'cause I'm the oldest.

05:55.460 --> 05:57.500
Will you kids stop the fighting?!
You both can go.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.330
Fifty-four, 55, 56...

06:00.330 --> 06:02.620
And take that one
with you.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.170
- Come on.
- ( counting continues )

06:14.330 --> 06:16.290
I am so excited
we are on a mission.

06:16.290 --> 06:17.920
I love being a spy.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.540
You're not a spy.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.750
And your only mission
is to zip it.

06:21.750 --> 06:25.000
You might wanna help her
on that mission, bro.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.380
Listen, he's right;
we need to be very careful,

06:27.380 --> 06:28.500
because anybody at
this marketplace

06:28.500 --> 06:30.460
could be here
to eliminate us.

06:30.460 --> 06:33.830
Anybody? What about Father
Time; is he out to get us too?

06:33.830 --> 06:36.290
Yes. He could just be
a guy dressed

06:36.290 --> 06:37.670
in an old man's disguise.

06:37.670 --> 06:41.170
( crashing sounds )

06:41.170 --> 06:43.540
Or he could be an actual old guy
who's gonna need a new hip.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.420
This is the alley
we're looking for.

06:48.420 --> 06:51.080
Okay, me and Marisa
will check it out,

06:51.080 --> 06:52.620
you stay here,
keep lookout,

06:52.620 --> 06:54.710
and do not play that scavenger
hunt game on your phone.

06:54.710 --> 06:56.460
We do not need your cell
pinging off towers.

06:56.460 --> 06:59.080
I'd like to ping you
off a tower.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.460
Excuse me.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.040
Uh, I said...

07:02.040 --> 07:03.500
I'll be happy
to keep lookout.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.250
Yeah. That's right,
that's what you said.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.420
Welcome back to
Scavenge Extreme.

07:11.420 --> 07:14.290
The next object to find,
photograph and upload

07:14.290 --> 07:16.290
is something made of wicker.

07:16.290 --> 07:18.500
Hmm. Something
made of wicker.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.330
That can be a toughie.

07:24.380 --> 07:28.000
This has gotta be, like, the most
beautiful alley in the world.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.120
These tiles have been
a tradition for decades.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.750
It was started by
a Chilean artist,

07:31.750 --> 07:33.750
and now, tourists from
all over the world bring tiles,

07:33.750 --> 07:35.170
and they glue them
to the walls.

07:35.170 --> 07:37.290
Wow. I love how
every country

07:37.290 --> 07:39.250
has their own
little traditions--

07:39.250 --> 07:41.620
Wait. How do
you know that?

07:43.330 --> 07:45.880
We've been locked in
that safe house for two weeks.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.830
I've had no choice
but to...

07:48.830 --> 07:50.290
read.

07:50.290 --> 07:52.710
Oh, wow, look at
this tile.

07:52.710 --> 07:54.540
It's so beautiful.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.040
Uh, wow, I would
hate to see

08:00.040 --> 08:03.330
what you do to
the ones you don't like.

08:03.330 --> 08:05.120
No, no, no, I'm looking
for the dead drop.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.210
Oh, of course.

08:07.210 --> 08:09.080
The dead drop.
I knew that.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.670
Now where's
that dead drop?

08:11.670 --> 08:13.290
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.290
You have no idea
what a dead drop is, do you?

08:15.290 --> 08:17.670
Not a clue.

08:17.670 --> 08:20.420
A dead drop is how agents
get information

08:20.420 --> 08:22.080
about a secure network.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.460
So behind one of these tiles
is a hidden USB port,

08:24.460 --> 08:26.330
and I take this
and it allows me

08:26.330 --> 08:27.790
to download updates
from the Organization.

08:27.790 --> 08:29.420
Cool. Got it.
I'll check this side.

08:29.420 --> 08:30.290
Cool.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.880
Hey, when we're done,
can we go back?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.710
You really wanna go back
to that dumpy apartment,

08:35.710 --> 08:37.460
because I can go my entire life
without ever seeing

08:37.460 --> 08:39.420
Ernie take another
sink bath.

08:39.420 --> 08:42.500
I meant back home.
It's our senior year.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.540
So?

08:43.540 --> 08:45.120
So it's our year of lasts.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.750
Our last first day
of school together,

08:46.750 --> 08:48.880
our last pep rally
together.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.290
Our last homecoming
dance together.

08:51.290 --> 08:53.460
Okay, Marisa, you know
I don't support homecoming,

08:53.460 --> 08:55.880
because of my stance against
voting for king and queen.

08:57.290 --> 09:00.330
Plus, no one ever
asks me, so...

09:00.330 --> 09:02.290
KC, I'm serious.

09:02.290 --> 09:05.750
You've been my best friend
my entire life.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.620
That's why this year
is so important.

09:08.620 --> 09:11.290
After graduation, we're
gonna go our separate ways.

09:11.290 --> 09:13.960
You to some fancy
Ivy League school,

09:13.960 --> 09:16.540
and me, to
Pierce Junior Junior College,

09:16.540 --> 09:18.500
AKA 13th grade.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.500
BOTH: Fingers crossed.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.330
I really think
we should appreciate

09:23.330 --> 09:24.460
what little time
we have left together.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.500
Marisa, relax.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
Okay, look, I promise you,

09:28.500 --> 09:30.460
no matter where we go
in life,

09:30.460 --> 09:32.330
we are still gonna
be best friends.

09:33.580 --> 09:36.290
Assuming we get
out of here alive.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.920
( KC laughs )

09:39.920 --> 09:42.080
Well, look at you,
Nancy Drew.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.540
- You found the dead drop.
- Maybe I really could be a spy.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.330
Yeah, sure,
but I would send in

09:46.330 --> 09:48.830
that junior junior college
application, just to be safe.

09:48.830 --> 09:50.460
You know, good to have
a back-up plan.

09:58.420 --> 10:01.580
Oh, a used diaper.

10:01.580 --> 10:03.420
Ew, a used diaper!

10:06.880 --> 10:09.460
Congratulations
on your used diaper.

10:09.460 --> 10:11.620
You've earned
triple scavenge points.

10:11.620 --> 10:15.040
You're currently in
4,436th place.

10:15.040 --> 10:18.380
Yes! Top 5,000.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.880
Your next object to find,
photograph and upload

10:20.880 --> 10:23.210
is someone with
very hairy ears.

10:23.210 --> 10:25.620
Jackpot.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.580
I've hit
the Mother Lode.

10:32.580 --> 10:35.500
The hairy Mother Lode.

10:36.620 --> 10:38.500
Are you playing
Scavenge Extreme?

10:38.500 --> 10:40.420
Yeah. This game is
the only thing

10:40.420 --> 10:42.880
that's kept me sane
on this trip.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.790
Congratulations on
your hairy ear pick.

10:44.790 --> 10:46.670
You are currently in
98th place.

10:46.670 --> 10:49.040
Ooh! What place
are you in?

10:49.040 --> 10:51.210
Uh, 99th.

10:51.210 --> 10:54.620
So you're
Pretty Princess 17?

10:54.620 --> 10:56.420
Yes, I am.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.000
But you can
call me Ernie.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.580
Hi. I'm Zoe.

10:59.580 --> 11:01.540
It is so good
to talk to another American.

11:01.540 --> 11:03.460
I'm from Kansas.
Where are you from?

11:03.460 --> 11:05.290
Uh, he's from Monrovia.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.330
His visa has just expired,
and we must go now.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.460
What did you do that for?
That Zoe girl was into me.

11:12.460 --> 11:15.880
Which makes me think she's either an
enemy agent or psychotic, or both.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.460
She's just a tourist.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.040
This is the last time
I'm gonna tell you.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.380
No more talking
to strangers.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.420
Fine, but
for the record,

11:22.420 --> 11:24.750
there's nothing
shady about her.

11:30.330 --> 11:33.460
It's Zoe.
I've made contact.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.120
Excellent.
Do not engage yet.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.210
Track their movements until
they lead us to the others.

11:39.210 --> 11:42.210
Then we can eliminate
the Coopers

11:42.210 --> 11:44.710
once and for all.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.580
Good news, Coop troop.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.880
♪ We have an update! ♪

11:58.880 --> 12:00.540
♪ Now I have
ringing in my ears ♪

12:00.540 --> 12:04.120
Okay, so Organization
intel says

12:04.120 --> 12:06.210
Zane has no idea
that we're in Rio.

12:06.210 --> 12:07.460
Well, it sounds like
we're safe.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.790
All right. Yeah!

12:09.790 --> 12:11.920
Yes, I am out of
this apartment,

12:11.920 --> 12:14.120
and into a sarong.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.330
I'm dying to check out
Carnival.

12:16.330 --> 12:18.330
I just wanna find
a private bathroom.

12:18.330 --> 12:20.710
Yes, we all want
that for you, Dad.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.750
But unfortunately,
we are not on vacation,

12:24.750 --> 12:26.420
because the Organization
gave us a mission.

12:26.420 --> 12:29.250
( gasps ) Oh, they
gave us a mission.

12:29.250 --> 12:32.170
No, they gave
us a mission.

12:32.170 --> 12:34.250
Fine.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.920
If you want me,
I will be in the other room.

12:38.210 --> 12:39.620
Seriously?

12:39.620 --> 12:41.920
The Organization couldn't
give us one day off?

12:41.920 --> 12:43.830
Boy, are they cheap.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.540
They're cheap? Craig,
when we go to the movies,

12:46.540 --> 12:49.080
you only buy one cup
of soda for all of us.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.170
I don't buy one cup.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.380
I find one in the trash,
wash it off in the bathroom,

12:53.380 --> 12:55.830
boom, free refills.

12:55.830 --> 12:58.330
Uh-huh. See, that's not
cheap, baby, that's smart.

12:58.330 --> 13:00.080
No, actually, Dad,
that's just gross.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.460
Okay, guys, I know
it's a bummer

13:03.460 --> 13:05.290
that we have to jump
right back into work,

13:05.290 --> 13:07.290
but I tried, okay?
I asked the Organization

13:07.290 --> 13:09.750
if we could stay in Rio and soak
up the local atmosphere,

13:09.750 --> 13:12.120
but they wouldn't budge,
no matter how many times

13:12.120 --> 13:16.380
I begged and begged
and begged and begged.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.620
You requested
the mission, didn't you?

13:18.620 --> 13:20.080
Yes, okay,
I'm bored.

13:21.380 --> 13:23.960
Yet I'm the one banished
behind the shower curtain.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.380
You banished yourself.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.710
Tell it to the curtain!

13:27.710 --> 13:29.920
See, everybody's going
after each other.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.620
Yelling and fighting, and Judy's
been throwing more shade than usual.

13:32.620 --> 13:36.960
No, I haven't,
you bug-eyed loser.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.460
Okay, maybe I have.

13:39.460 --> 13:43.420
Come on, just one big
family mission.

13:43.420 --> 13:45.420
For me, please?

13:45.420 --> 13:48.120
- Okay. - All right. - Whatever.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.420
Okay, not the resounding
enthusiasm I was hoping for,

13:50.420 --> 13:52.210
but you know what,
I'll take it.

13:54.330 --> 13:55.880
Okay, come on.

14:00.080 --> 14:04.080
Our mission is to stop a ring of
international bird smugglers.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.540
Bird snugglers? Who
snuggles with a bird?

14:06.540 --> 14:09.250
They poop and pee
out of the same place.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.290
It's true,
it's called a cloaca.

14:11.290 --> 14:15.500
Great. Not only am I reading,
I am retaining knowledge.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.540
No, not bird snugglers.

14:19.540 --> 14:21.380
Bird smugglers.

14:21.380 --> 14:22.540
They capture
and illegally transport

14:22.540 --> 14:24.170
exotic birds
out of the country,

14:24.170 --> 14:26.080
which messes up
the local ecosystem.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.330
Seriously? I can't get a
mango through customs,

14:28.330 --> 14:30.460
and this guy is getting
whole birds through?

14:30.460 --> 14:32.710
Okay, so our job

14:32.710 --> 14:35.670
is to find and capture
the head of the ring.

14:35.670 --> 14:39.080
His name is Passaro Grande,
AKA Big Bird.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.290
Well, we better get on it
before he flies the coop.

14:41.290 --> 14:44.040
( laughter )

14:44.040 --> 14:45.330
Oh, now I'm laughing
at Ernie's jokes.

14:45.330 --> 14:47.710
We gotta get
out of Rio, guys.

14:55.460 --> 14:57.290
Step right up, folks.

14:57.290 --> 15:00.420
Get your cooked animal
carcasses with starchy food,

15:00.420 --> 15:03.290
grown in soil fertilized
by those same animals.

15:03.290 --> 15:04.790
Yum, yum, yum!

15:06.750 --> 15:09.710
Yo, Leticia, your sales pitch
needs a little work.

15:09.710 --> 15:11.670
So does your cooking.

15:11.670 --> 15:13.920
No one wants a dried-up kebab
that can double as a belt.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.380
Speak for yourself.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.880
I see your point.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.620
All right, we've circled
the entire market.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.290
There's no sign
of the target.

15:28.290 --> 15:30.080
Do you guys see anything?

15:30.080 --> 15:31.710
No, but I sold
three sketches.

15:31.710 --> 15:34.330
I could have a real future
doing big-head caricatures.

15:34.330 --> 15:37.000
Way to aim high, son.

15:39.620 --> 15:42.460
I just spotted one of
Passaro Grande's crew.

15:42.460 --> 15:45.420
The woman in red
by the entrance.

15:45.420 --> 15:48.710
Okay, Mom, time to put a
little more bait on the hook.

15:51.960 --> 15:56.880
This is a lovely
leather mosaic purse.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.500
It's Brazil-liant!

15:59.500 --> 16:02.250
Don't you think so,
Lavender dear?

16:02.250 --> 16:04.000
Ugh. Makes me wanna
bring the cow back to life

16:04.000 --> 16:06.880
and slap it
for getting involved.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.000
But it has fringe,

16:09.000 --> 16:10.750
and you love fringe.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.380
And it's so colorful.

16:12.380 --> 16:13.920
Mom, I don't want
a stupid purse, okay?

16:13.920 --> 16:16.170
I want, like, a rare exotic
bird to take back home.

16:16.170 --> 16:17.460
And I want it now!

16:17.460 --> 16:20.500
I want it
now, now, now!

16:20.500 --> 16:22.420
Lavender dear,

16:22.420 --> 16:24.290
we can't possibly
take rare birds

16:24.290 --> 16:26.120
back to America.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.120
It's illegal!

16:29.120 --> 16:31.540
I could not help
overhearing.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.880
You want to purchase
a rare bird?

16:33.880 --> 16:36.080
Yes. The more expensive,
the better.

16:36.080 --> 16:39.330
Well, I can introduce you
to a man that can get you

16:39.330 --> 16:41.460
any bird you want.

16:41.460 --> 16:44.380
He goes by the name
of Passaro Grande.

16:44.380 --> 16:48.290
Meet him in that alley
at midnight.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.420
Midnight? She wants us
to meet a smuggler

16:52.420 --> 16:54.710
in an alley
at midnight.

16:54.710 --> 16:56.880
It's good to
be working again.

17:10.380 --> 17:13.540
Received the images.

17:13.540 --> 17:17.880
I can confirm
those are the Coopers.

17:23.330 --> 17:25.330
Hi, Ernie.

17:25.330 --> 17:28.670
Sorry. I don't talk to
strangers, and I'm not Ernie.

17:28.670 --> 17:30.880
Uh, really?

17:30.880 --> 17:33.420
Because you were Ernie yesterday
when I met you in the marketplace.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.830
I'm Zoe.

17:34.830 --> 17:37.460
Sorry. No ingles-a!

17:37.460 --> 17:40.830
I speak-a the Portuguese-a.

17:40.830 --> 17:42.330
That's not Portuguese.

17:42.330 --> 17:43.880
That's just you
adding a lot of vowels.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.920
And if you don't
remember me,

17:47.920 --> 17:51.080
then who's riding the horse with
you through the fields of Kansas,

17:51.080 --> 17:53.460
where coincidentally,
I'm from.

17:53.460 --> 17:56.460
In that case,
what's Portuguese-a for,

17:56.460 --> 18:00.540
"Oh, yeah, I guess I do
remember you"?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.710
Zoe and I talked
for, like, 20 minutes,

18:04.710 --> 18:06.880
and I had her laughing
the whole time.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.000
- What?!
- And not just at me, with me, too.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.420
Oh, it sounds like
my son's turning into

18:12.420 --> 18:13.750
a real lady-killer.

18:13.750 --> 18:16.500
And no, I'm not
talking about that accident

18:16.500 --> 18:18.380
on your last mission.

18:18.380 --> 18:21.040
May she rest in peace.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.960
You need to stop
encouraging him, okay?

18:22.960 --> 18:24.620
Look, I know the Organization
said Rio was clear,

18:24.620 --> 18:26.460
but Zane is still a threat,

18:26.460 --> 18:28.420
and I do not trust
that little Kansas girl.

18:28.420 --> 18:30.380
Why are you
so wound up lately?

18:30.380 --> 18:32.290
She's not an enemy agent.

18:32.290 --> 18:34.330
She's just a regular girl
on vacation.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.580
In Brazil?

18:35.580 --> 18:37.380
The land of hunky
soccer players.

18:37.380 --> 18:39.290
She is in a sea
full of steak.

18:39.290 --> 18:41.250
Why would she
pick a shrimp?

18:41.250 --> 18:43.460
Are you saying
the only reason

18:43.460 --> 18:46.080
a girl would talk to me is
because she's trying to kill me?

18:46.080 --> 18:47.670
No.

18:47.670 --> 18:49.380
They also wanna
die of boredom.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.620
She could just want
her computer fixed.

18:53.620 --> 18:55.290
She might be on a dare.

18:55.290 --> 18:57.620
How dare you?!

18:57.620 --> 18:59.460
I am sick and tired
of you underestimating me.

18:59.460 --> 19:00.920
Then stop making it
so easy.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.170
( both arguing )

19:03.170 --> 19:05.210
Stop, stop, stop.
Enough, you two.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.250
Come on, KC,
your brother has a point.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.250
You need to put
some respect on his name.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.380
Yeah, respect it.

19:11.380 --> 19:12.960
Your brother's
got it goin' on.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.710
Yes, I do.

19:15.710 --> 19:18.330
Thank you, Dad. I'm glad
somebody's got my back.

19:18.330 --> 19:19.880
Hey, I always do, son.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.710
And don't you
forget it.

19:21.710 --> 19:23.920
Would you keep
an eye on that girl?

19:23.920 --> 19:25.920
I don't trust her neither. What the
heck is she talking to Ernie for?

19:35.210 --> 19:37.120
It's almost midnight. Big Bird
should be here any second.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.460
Okay, real quick.
After we catch the smuggler,

19:39.460 --> 19:42.120
can we go back to the market
and get that fringe purse?

19:42.120 --> 19:44.500
- I thought you hated that purse.
- No, Lavender hates the purse,

19:44.500 --> 19:48.540
but KC wants to fill it with rocks
and use it as an improvised weapon.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.120
Excuse me. Are you Passaro
Grande AKA Big Bird?

19:56.120 --> 19:58.380
What gave it away?

19:58.380 --> 20:00.960
Lucky guess.

20:00.960 --> 20:05.290
My daughter wants your rarest
and most colorful bird.

20:06.420 --> 20:09.290
A rainbow with wings,
if you will.

20:09.290 --> 20:12.040
And money is no object.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.620
I like your style.

20:13.620 --> 20:15.120
And your money.

20:18.420 --> 20:20.670
Oh, yes. Let me
get a rag,

20:20.670 --> 20:22.250
just in case.

20:22.250 --> 20:24.580
You know, birds poopy
and pee out of the same place.

20:24.580 --> 20:26.250
It's called cloaca.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.580
- So I've heard.
- Okay, be right back.

20:31.380 --> 20:34.080
Oh, hey, KC,
hey, Mrs. Cooper.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.920
Oh, I love those wigs.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.500
Cool birds.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.380
Oh, you must've caught
that bird smuggler guy

20:39.380 --> 20:41.500
and took him down.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.250
Oh, Marisa.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.460
All right, stay there.

20:46.460 --> 20:48.250
Not you, Marisa.

20:48.250 --> 20:50.000
You gotta help.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.420
Hey, find the guy?

20:55.420 --> 20:57.080
We had him,
but we lost him.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.380
How the heck
did you lose him?

20:58.380 --> 21:01.880
Let's not get
bogged down in details.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.290
You don't understand
the immense pressure

21:04.290 --> 21:06.330
KC was under back there.

21:06.330 --> 21:08.000
- Marisa mess it up?
- Big time.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.880
( all groaning )

21:09.880 --> 21:11.620
Okay, this is no time
for the blame game.

21:11.620 --> 21:14.460
But just to be clear,
it was all your fault, Marisa.

21:17.250 --> 21:20.170
What now? Passaro Grande could
be anywhere in this crowd.

21:20.170 --> 21:23.670
There's too many people.
We need a better vantage point.

21:23.670 --> 21:26.830
If only you had a technologically
advanced humanoid

21:26.830 --> 21:29.420
who could do a facial
recognition scan of the crowd.

21:29.420 --> 21:31.040
Oh, wait, you do.

21:32.830 --> 21:34.790
I'm just gonna need
all eyes on me.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.330
Well, I think I can get
everyone's attention.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.460
I mean, I am fly.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.830
Yeah, speaking of which.
Again, bro.

21:45.420 --> 21:47.080
- There's gotta be--
- I have an idea.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.620
- All we have to do--
- Pick me, pick me.

21:49.620 --> 21:52.420
Oh, pick me, pick me,
me, me, me, me!

21:52.420 --> 21:53.790
Pick me.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.620
Yes, Marisa. What?

21:55.620 --> 21:57.670
As you've pointed out
on many occasions,

21:57.670 --> 22:00.460
I am an expert at
calling attention to myself,

22:00.460 --> 22:01.750
so let me do my thing.

22:01.750 --> 22:03.670
I never thought
I'd say this,

22:03.670 --> 22:05.500
but Marisa,
what do you wanna do?

22:05.500 --> 22:07.460
I'm gonna need a short dress,
high heels,

22:07.460 --> 22:09.830

23:15.710 --> 23:17.330

Okay, one little problem.
I don't sing.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.500
Oh, that's okay.
Just follow my lead.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.880

I won't sing.

- Not this time, he's not.

25:12.620 --> 25:15.500
All right, Big Bird, time to
lock you up in your own cage.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.330
Wait, wait, wait.
We can make a deal, right?

25:17.330 --> 25:19.460
You want a bird.

25:19.460 --> 25:23.460
I got a bird that can insult you
in five different languages.

25:23.460 --> 25:25.750
Yeah, no, thank you. I got a little
sister who can do the same thing.

25:25.750 --> 25:27.290
I'm not going to jail.

25:32.290 --> 25:33.830
All right, Passaro Grande,
you are...

25:36.120 --> 25:37.500
( squawking )

25:37.500 --> 25:40.420
Oh.

25:40.420 --> 25:43.080
Huh. Couldn't have said it
better myself.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.750
All right,
let's roll.

25:56.040 --> 25:58.000
That's excellent news.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.210
You have the green light
to engage.

26:00.210 --> 26:04.380
Operation Good-bye Coopers
is a go.

26:08.540 --> 26:11.330
So now that we're done with
the mission, can we go home?

26:11.330 --> 26:13.670
Maybe we can make
our last first day of school.

26:13.670 --> 26:17.120
Yeah, it'll be your last
first day of detention.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.500
It's not up to us
when we get to leave, Marisa.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.120
It's up to
the Organization.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.420
Yeah, my parents
should have an update

26:23.420 --> 26:25.710
when they get back from turning in
Birdman to the local authorities.

26:25.710 --> 26:28.460
So for now, let's just enjoy
the fact that we're safe.

26:28.460 --> 26:31.330
( toilet flushes )

26:31.330 --> 26:34.250
If we're all out here,
who just flushed?

26:34.250 --> 26:36.880
I'll bet it's your girlfriend
from Kansas here to eliminate us.

26:40.710 --> 26:43.080
Actually, I'm Sheena.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.420
From Canada.

26:44.420 --> 26:47.380
Home of maple syrup,
Celine Dion,

26:47.380 --> 26:49.380
and deadly
hired assassins.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.750
Oh, and just to be clear,

26:52.750 --> 26:55.330
I'm not sweet,
and I don't sing.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.670
Okay, this is the unsafest
safe house ever.

26:58.670 --> 27:00.580
Who sent you?

27:00.580 --> 27:02.920
Don't tell them, Sheena.
I don't trust them.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.120
You don't have to
trust them, Sheena.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.670
You just have to
eliminate them.

27:06.670 --> 27:09.290
Oh, yeah, you're right.
That's a good point, Sheena.

27:10.750 --> 27:12.380
I'm sorry,
I hate to interrupt,

27:12.380 --> 27:15.830
but is one of you
gonna tell us who sent you?

27:15.830 --> 27:18.250
That would be Zane.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.710
And that would be pain.

27:25.710 --> 27:27.540
Ooh, that was
a good one, Sheena.

27:27.540 --> 27:30.080
Thank you, Sheena.
Let's do it again. Get up!

27:30.080 --> 27:32.080
Wait, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.460
Were you talking
to me that time?

27:39.830 --> 27:42.120
Is that all you've got?

27:42.120 --> 27:44.880
You've gotta come on
with the come on, KC. Get up!

27:44.880 --> 27:47.540
If you want me up so bad, why
did you throw me on the ground?

28:10.330 --> 28:13.330
Come on, Ernie, you really
gotta work on your aim, bro.

28:22.790 --> 28:25.290
Okay, okay, Ernie,
a little help here?

28:29.460 --> 28:32.750
Ooh, I knew that bag
would come in handy.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.460
Not gonna lie.
That hurt.

28:41.460 --> 28:45.080
Okay. Okay,
I'm up, I'm up.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.620
I'm up.

28:46.620 --> 28:47.670
- Boo.
- ( shrieks )

28:56.620 --> 28:58.710
You wanna know the difference
between me and you?

28:58.710 --> 29:01.790
I'm not cat-pee cuckoo?

29:01.790 --> 29:04.750
No. I'm walking out of here
in one piece.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.500
Zoe?!

29:11.500 --> 29:13.500
Aw, frick,
there's another one.

29:13.500 --> 29:14.710
I told you
Kansas was no good.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.420
You're right,
I'm not good.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.330
I'm the best.

29:28.290 --> 29:29.540
I'm starting to think

29:29.540 --> 29:32.120
you're not really
here on vacation.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.920
I'm with the Organization.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.080
I've been tracking your family
since you arrived in Rio.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.580
I was sent to protect
all of you.

29:37.580 --> 29:39.500
Ha! See?

29:39.500 --> 29:41.920
She wasn't pretending
to like me so she could kill us.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.080
No, she was doing it
'cause she was ordered to.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.040
I'll take it.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.500
Look, we don't
have time for this.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.250
She could have
back-up on the way.

29:49.250 --> 29:51.670
You wanna live,
follow me, people.

30:02.580 --> 30:04.290
They're running away, Sheena.

30:04.290 --> 30:05.710
That's okay, Sheena.

30:05.710 --> 30:07.290
We'll just catch them.

30:07.290 --> 30:09.420
Oh, this should
be fun, Sheena.

30:09.420 --> 30:12.330
Couldn't have said it
better myself.

30:12.330 --> 30:13.790
Wait, but you did
just say it yourself.

30:13.790 --> 30:15.210
Don't correct me.

30:21.460 --> 30:24.460
Okay, Zoe, just
out of curiosity,

30:24.460 --> 30:27.420
where the heck are we going?

30:27.420 --> 30:29.040
To the extraction point,

30:29.040 --> 30:30.460
where you'll be taken
to your new safe house.

30:30.460 --> 30:32.500
Just keep driving.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.500
And by the way, a little
more AC would be great.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.420
The assassins might not
have gotten us,

30:36.420 --> 30:39.080
but the humidity
is a killer.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.460
I know, right? It is
like a sauna in here.

30:41.460 --> 30:44.380
And not in a good, "spend the
day at the spa" kind of way.

30:44.380 --> 30:46.830
Tell me about it.

30:46.830 --> 30:49.420
Uh, KC,
turn off the headlights.

30:49.420 --> 30:52.170
Uh, yeah, and just to make things
a little more interesting,

30:52.170 --> 30:54.330
maybe I should just
drive with my eyes closed.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.460
No, that would
just be stupid.

30:56.460 --> 30:59.330
Okay, since you wanna
call all the shots here,

30:59.330 --> 31:00.670
how about you
just take the wheel?

31:00.670 --> 31:02.960
- I'm navigating.
- Oh, really?

31:02.960 --> 31:05.830
Legs probably can't
reach the pedals.

31:05.830 --> 31:09.080
Look, I'm just trying
to be extra cautious

31:09.080 --> 31:11.670
in case we're being followed,
so chop-chop.

31:11.670 --> 31:15.040
Okay, Junior.
All right.

31:15.040 --> 31:19.120
It's not my first time at the
"I've escaped an assassin" rodeo.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.290
I happen to excel at
evasive driving.

31:21.290 --> 31:23.620
She also excels
at evasive dating.

31:23.620 --> 31:26.380
Not helping, Marisa.

31:26.380 --> 31:29.250
Stop being so stubborn
and shut off your headlights.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.210
Just because it wasn't
your idea

31:31.210 --> 31:32.460
doesn't mean
it's not a good one.

31:32.460 --> 31:34.080
I know what I'm doing.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.080
For the last time,
no one is following us.

31:38.210 --> 31:41.580
You haven't lost yet, Sheena!
The game is still on.

31:41.580 --> 31:45.500
Sheena, what did we say about
talking to yourself?

31:45.500 --> 31:48.330
It's nice to speak to someone
of equal intelligence?

31:48.330 --> 31:50.880
Darn right!

31:50.880 --> 31:53.040
But hey, don't repeat that
to anyone, okay?

31:53.040 --> 31:54.420
It makes us look
full of ourself.

31:54.420 --> 31:56.460
I guess you're right.

31:56.460 --> 32:01.120
We may be deadly, but we do
keep it one hundred, okay.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.040
We're under attack,
we're under attack!

32:05.040 --> 32:07.250
How did I not see that
somebody was behind me?

32:07.250 --> 32:09.830
I'm guessing they were smart enough
to turn off their headlights.

32:09.830 --> 32:11.880
Okay, I'll do it.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.580
Little late for that.

32:18.460 --> 32:20.170
Okay, you know what?
New plan.

32:20.170 --> 32:21.460
We're getting off this road
and driving through the jungle.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.500
Wow, you're just a barrel
of bad ideas.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.290
I don't think
you should do that.

32:25.290 --> 32:27.290
Yeah, well, I think
you're wrong.

32:36.460 --> 32:38.460
Ah! I did it.
I lost 'em.

32:38.460 --> 32:41.670
( tires exploding )

32:41.670 --> 32:45.290
Yeah, you lost them,
and three of the tires.

32:45.290 --> 32:47.960
- ( tire explodes )
- Wrong again, Zoe.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.080
I lost four of the tires.

32:58.670 --> 33:02.380
This cave will be a perfect
place to spend the night.

33:02.380 --> 33:06.500
There's a sentence no one's said
in about five million years.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.250
Ooh, I hear a stream.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.540
I'll go fill up
the water bottles.

33:10.540 --> 33:12.540
( mockingly )
"Ooh, I hear a stream..."

33:14.540 --> 33:16.540
Hey, when you gotta go,
you gotta go.

33:18.170 --> 33:21.290
Oh, you were talking
about Zoe.

33:22.830 --> 33:25.880
I hope she brings back
some food; I'm starving.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.620
I could literally eat
anything at this point.

33:28.620 --> 33:30.790
Well, you two
are in luck.

33:30.790 --> 33:32.380
Yep, that's right.

33:32.380 --> 33:34.290
This is dinner, okay?
Zoe's not the only one

33:34.290 --> 33:36.080
who knows how
to survive in the jungle.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.330
Are you kidding me
with that?

33:37.330 --> 33:39.460
Look, it may not
be pretty, but it's protein.

33:39.460 --> 33:44.210
No, protein is breaded, fried, and
served with a starchy side dish.

33:44.210 --> 33:46.500
I'm not eating bugs.

33:46.500 --> 33:49.620
Why not? You ate boogers
until you were six.

33:49.620 --> 33:52.580
They weren't alive.

33:52.580 --> 33:54.420
Just close your eyes, okay.
It'll help you get it down.

33:54.420 --> 33:56.420
I'm not worried about
getting it down.

33:56.420 --> 33:57.880
I'm worried about
keeping it down.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.620
Well, you should be worried
about getting it down,

33:59.620 --> 34:02.960
because if you don't, they'll
lay eggs in your throat.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.750
I'm kidding,
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

34:04.750 --> 34:06.290
Sort of.

34:06.290 --> 34:07.880
Here.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.750
No, no, no.
No, no. I'm not eating those.

34:09.750 --> 34:11.670
Marisa, come on,
you gotta eat.

34:11.670 --> 34:13.620
You need some energy
to trek through this jungle.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.920
No, there's absolutely nothing you
can say to make me eat those.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.170
- They'll make your eyelashes grow.
- Give 'em to me.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.880
Oh, it is squishy,
it is moving,

34:22.880 --> 34:26.620
- and it is biting me back.
- Just chew through it, okay.

34:28.170 --> 34:29.750
What are you eating?

34:29.750 --> 34:31.420
Bugs for nutrition.

34:31.420 --> 34:32.830
I'm sure the fact that you're
not thinking about that

34:32.830 --> 34:34.330
has you kicking yourself.

34:34.330 --> 34:36.830
If not, I'd be happy
to do it for you.

34:36.830 --> 34:38.710
You know, this reminds me
of the time I was trekking

34:38.710 --> 34:40.710
through the hot jungles
of Central America,

34:40.710 --> 34:42.750
helping to bring down
a corrupt monarchy.

34:42.750 --> 34:45.420
I spent three days on
a bare sustenance diet.

34:45.420 --> 34:49.290
- Know what I learned?
- Apparently not how to get to the point.

34:49.290 --> 34:53.080
That when you're on the run,
always bring protein bars.

34:54.380 --> 34:55.670
I'm gonna kill you!

34:55.670 --> 34:59.750
Sh! Don't move.

34:59.750 --> 35:02.170
If that Brazilian
jumping spider bites you,

35:02.170 --> 35:04.170
you'll be temporarily
paralyzed from the neck down.

35:08.710 --> 35:12.380
Well, there goes dessert.

35:12.380 --> 35:14.380
We'll start the hike to the
extraction point at sunrise.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.540
Ernie, you wanna help me
find some firewood?

35:16.540 --> 35:18.880
You mean,
just the two of us,

35:18.880 --> 35:21.250
alone out there
in the dark jungle?

35:22.290 --> 35:24.710
I thought you'd
never ask.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.620
Protein bars.

35:28.620 --> 35:30.880
They must've changed survival
training with her class.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.830
Young agents are soft,
I tell you, soft.

35:41.790 --> 35:45.250

35:45.250 --> 35:47.250

35:51.040 --> 35:53.460

35:53.460 --> 35:54.670
Kira, this doesn't
look good.

35:54.670 --> 35:56.580
Doesn't sound good either.

35:56.580 --> 35:58.380
Somebody's a little pitchy.

35:58.380 --> 36:00.710
You wanna help?

36:00.710 --> 36:03.210
Yeah.
( sings operatic note )

36:03.210 --> 36:04.920
Now that's where
you wanna be.

36:06.380 --> 36:08.420
Analyze
the crime scene, girl.

36:13.290 --> 36:14.830
I found a footprint.

36:14.830 --> 36:17.170
Too big to be KC,
and too small to be Ernie.

36:17.170 --> 36:18.920
See, I do help.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.670
Maybe it's
Marisa's footprint.

36:20.670 --> 36:22.250
No, this is
a work boot.

36:22.250 --> 36:25.000
We all know she don't
like to do any work.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.250
But it does belong
to a young woman.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.620
I bet it's that girl that
was pretending to like Ernie.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.290
KC was right about her.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.420
I found some DNA
on this fabric.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.920
If we can match who it belongs
to, we can find KC and Ernie.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.040
- And Marisa.
- Yeah, her too.

36:39.540 --> 36:42.670
♪ Let's go out and find them,
let's go out and find them ♪

36:42.670 --> 36:45.170
♪ Let's go out

36:46.500 --> 36:49.460
So we're not
doing that anymore?

36:49.460 --> 36:51.290
BOTH: No, we're not
doing that.

37:04.460 --> 37:06.040
What's that, KC?

37:06.040 --> 37:07.620
You need a break?

37:07.620 --> 37:10.670
Okay, we should probably
stop here and rest.

37:10.670 --> 37:13.290
You know,
for KC's sake.

37:14.330 --> 37:17.460
Okay, we'll rest a few minutes,
then head due north.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.500
Actually, due north
is that way.

37:19.500 --> 37:22.460
- I think you're mistaken.
- I think I'm mis-not-staken.

37:24.210 --> 37:25.670
All I need is to get
on this tree,

37:25.670 --> 37:27.290
and see where the sun is.

37:38.460 --> 37:40.040
It's not my fault.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.120
The tree's a little
wet and slippery.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.330
A wet, slippery tree
in a rain forest.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.620
Who would've seen
that coming?

37:47.000 --> 37:49.290
I'll do it. The trick
is using your legs.

37:54.710 --> 37:58.830
Wow, she is so much better
at that than you.

37:58.830 --> 38:00.880
Whose side are you on?

38:02.380 --> 38:04.170
Why are you throwing
so much shade at her?

38:04.170 --> 38:06.380
Because I can't throw a rock
at her and not get in trouble.

38:07.710 --> 38:09.420
How can you guys stand
being around someone

38:09.420 --> 38:11.080
who constantly insists
on being perfect?

38:11.080 --> 38:12.880
I don't know.

38:12.880 --> 38:16.920
Why don't we ask anyone who's
ever met you, Miss Perfect?

38:16.920 --> 38:18.540
I never said
I was perfect.

38:18.540 --> 38:20.290
She's the one talking about
she's perfect.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.460
North is that way.
I was right.

38:26.460 --> 38:27.750
Mm, perfect.

38:36.960 --> 38:38.330
Good news, Zane.

38:38.330 --> 38:40.040
I've located their Jeep
in the jungle.

38:40.040 --> 38:42.170
That would be wonderful,

38:42.170 --> 38:44.710
if your mission was to find
and kill their Jeep.

38:44.710 --> 38:48.290
Hang up and keep
tracking them.

38:48.290 --> 38:51.250
I'm on it.
Ugh, he is such a tool.

38:51.250 --> 38:54.670
Sheena, he's your boss,
okay, show some respect.

38:54.670 --> 38:57.670
Fine. I'll just pretend
I respect the tool.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.670
Sick burn, Sheena.

39:03.080 --> 39:05.290
You didn't disconnect.

39:05.290 --> 39:07.250
I can still hear you.

39:07.250 --> 39:09.210
Oh. On it, sir.

39:15.040 --> 39:17.460
Ugh. The way this is going,
I'm going to miss

39:17.460 --> 39:19.710
the entire
first week of school.

39:19.710 --> 39:22.290
Yeah, well, normally, you
miss the entire first month,

39:22.290 --> 39:24.290
so this is kind of
an improvement.

39:24.290 --> 39:25.880
It is not funny, KC.

39:25.880 --> 39:28.000
The one time I actually
want to go to school,

39:28.000 --> 39:31.330
I am stuck on a spy mission
in the jungles of Brazil.

39:31.330 --> 39:33.710
Why does this always
happen to me?

39:33.710 --> 39:36.290
Always? Always, Marisa?
This always happens to you?

39:36.290 --> 39:38.960
Is this some type of
recurring thing

39:38.960 --> 39:41.250
that you failed
to mention to me?

39:41.250 --> 39:43.420
Marisa, if it's that
big of a deal,

39:43.420 --> 39:45.420
the Organization can always
go into the school's database

39:45.420 --> 39:46.880
and change your
attendance record.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.580
While they're in there,
can they give me a B average?

39:49.580 --> 39:52.290
They're good, but
they're not that good.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.580
I'm tired.
Are we there yet?

39:54.580 --> 39:56.830
Uh, yeah, yeah, Ernie. Actually,
this is our backyard.

39:56.830 --> 39:58.540
It's just, we've been
gone so long,

39:58.540 --> 40:00.710
so it's overgrown
with palm trees and stuff,

40:00.710 --> 40:02.540
so you might wanna
actually bring out

40:02.540 --> 40:04.880
your garden tools
and clean up around here.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.670
A simple no
would suffice.

40:09.080 --> 40:11.120
Oh, look, a waterfall.
How beautiful.

40:11.120 --> 40:14.330
Hey, I say we take a break
and go swimming.

40:14.330 --> 40:16.170
That does sound
refreshing.

40:16.170 --> 40:17.460
But we don't have
any swimsuits.

40:17.460 --> 40:21.620
Fortunately, I brought
my birthday suit.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.880
Okay, I'm shuttin'
this down right now.

40:26.670 --> 40:28.880
Has everybody forgotten that
we are on the run,

40:28.880 --> 40:30.290
looking for
an extraction point?

40:30.290 --> 40:32.080
What's wrong with
a little break?

40:32.080 --> 40:34.420
Everything's fine,
and we're in no danger.

40:34.420 --> 40:35.330
( Sheena yelling )

40:40.420 --> 40:44.120
Ah, well, look at that. The one
time little Miss Perfect's wrong.

40:52.670 --> 40:53.790
Now...

40:53.790 --> 40:55.460
whose coconut should be next?

40:55.460 --> 40:57.330
And just in case
there's any confusion,

40:57.330 --> 40:59.330
by coconut,
I mean head.

41:01.290 --> 41:02.460
Very witty, Sheena.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.460
I try, girl.
I try.

41:07.040 --> 41:09.040
You got 'em right where
you want 'em, Sheena.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.880
We should just
take 'em out right now, Sheena.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.080
Oh, no, I think we need
to take our time

41:14.080 --> 41:15.670
and enjoy it, Sheena.

41:15.670 --> 41:18.460
Uh, excuse me,
Sheena, is it?

41:18.460 --> 41:21.880
Look, that is very impressive
sword work.

41:21.880 --> 41:25.710
You should go on one of
those TV talent show things.

41:25.710 --> 41:28.380
I bet you a lot of people
will call in and vote for you.

41:28.380 --> 41:30.460
Okay, okay. Not a huge fan
of talent shows.

41:30.460 --> 41:32.120
I feel you, I feel you.

41:32.120 --> 41:35.080
But listen, you don't
have to do this, okay?

41:35.080 --> 41:37.420
You seem like
a sensible person,

41:37.420 --> 41:39.710
aside from the whole
talking to yourself thing,

41:39.710 --> 41:41.250
and the wackadoo
look in your eyes.

41:43.670 --> 41:45.830
Okay, how about this?

41:45.830 --> 41:47.880
How about you just
let us go,

41:47.880 --> 41:50.000
and go ahead and start
a new life for yourself?

41:50.000 --> 41:51.960
Ugh, you sound just like
my parents.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.960
Your parents?

41:53.960 --> 41:56.710
Did you let them go?

41:56.710 --> 41:59.790
I mean, they wanted me
to go to college and everything,

41:59.790 --> 42:02.290
and become an engineer,
you know.

42:02.290 --> 42:04.540
But I really don't like
putting things together,

42:04.540 --> 42:06.880
as much as I like...

42:06.880 --> 42:08.710
taking them apart!

42:11.540 --> 42:13.040
Ha! Don't make me use this.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.460
Why, because
you're gonna hurt me?

42:14.460 --> 42:16.960
No, because it's not
a very effective weapon,

42:16.960 --> 42:19.830
and I'm probably gonna lose.

42:19.830 --> 42:22.460
No, you're definitely
gonna lose.

42:22.460 --> 42:24.330
Oh, really, well,
if you haven't noticed,

42:24.330 --> 42:26.250
it's four of us,
and only one of you.

42:33.540 --> 42:37.210
All right, well, now
it's just you and me.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.250
Rob, your name's on TV.
