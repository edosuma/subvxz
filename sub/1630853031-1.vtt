02:11.473 --> 02:15.577
Listen to me.
I have something to tell you.

02:20.917 --> 02:26.055
It wasn't long ago,
I was just like you.

02:27.555 --> 02:30.059
Thought I could, uh,

02:30.092 --> 02:35.131
run away from...
from my nightmares, also.

02:39.567 --> 02:41.536
If only there was a place

02:41.569 --> 02:45.207
I could run to that
they wouldn't follow me.

02:55.517 --> 02:58.620
I hate to tell you this.

02:58.653 --> 03:01.157
No such place exists.

03:05.828 --> 03:10.699
Wherever I went,

03:10.732 --> 03:15.570
there they were.

03:23.079 --> 03:29.718
But don't be afraid,
because I found peace.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.925
Everything comes to an end,
they say.

03:40.729 --> 03:44.632
They also say,
life just goes on.

03:48.603 --> 03:55.277
At some point, you just have
to accept your nightmares,

03:55.311 --> 03:59.215
and know they're...

03:59.248 --> 04:04.053
they're part of you,
like family,

04:06.222 --> 04:08.791
Like an old friend.

04:13.029 --> 04:21.029
So I've come to a place
where I'm gonna walk alone

04:21.904 --> 04:28.643
with open arms,
just like an old friend.

04:41.257 --> 04:44.692
What's their name?

04:44.726 --> 04:46.962
It's no friend.

05:11.921 --> 05:16.758
To Marie Aldrich,
please come at once.

05:16.792 --> 05:20.695
Your mother's grave
has been vandalized.

05:20.728 --> 05:22.998
As her only living relative,

05:23.032 --> 05:27.336
it is up to you
to decide how to proceed.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.638
Of course, this is
very pressing,

05:30.672 --> 05:34.944
and discretion
is of the highest priority.

05:34.977 --> 05:38.280
Sincerely, H. Grierson,

05:38.314 --> 05:42.351
Caretaker, Lone Palm Cemetery.

05:56.232 --> 05:58.200
Look.

06:11.213 --> 06:13.115
Closed till spring.

06:13.149 --> 06:14.749
What?

06:16.318 --> 06:18.363
Bridge goes up at dawn.
The island's closed till spring.

06:18.387 --> 06:20.688
I'm not letting anybody new in.

06:20.722 --> 06:22.091
Just gonna be locals only.

06:22.124 --> 06:23.859
- That can't be.
- What do you mean?

06:23.893 --> 06:25.427
No one can get over there?

06:25.461 --> 06:28.864
Our last tourists,
they left on Tuesday.

06:28.898 --> 06:30.266
Kinda just easier that way.

06:30.299 --> 06:31.910
Sir, you don't understand,
we're not tourist.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.802
How do you close
an entire island?

06:33.836 --> 06:35.404
It's just till spring.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.473
Look.

06:37.506 --> 06:39.909
I got this letter
just yesterday.

06:41.243 --> 06:42.912
This is an emergency.

06:42.945 --> 06:46.015
I have to get to the cemetery
as soon as possible.

06:48.284 --> 06:50.119
Please.

07:03.999 --> 07:05.434
We better not waste any time.

07:42.471 --> 07:44.006
You okay?

07:44.039 --> 07:45.474
Yeah. Are you?

07:45.507 --> 07:47.810
Yeah.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.445
Did you know that?

07:52.248 --> 07:53.816
Whole island closes.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.217
Of course I didn't know that.

07:55.251 --> 07:57.987
What was the plan
if we got in tomorrow,

07:58.020 --> 07:59.388
and the bridge
was already locked?

07:59.421 --> 08:02.057
I don't know, George.

08:02.091 --> 08:05.060
I guess we'd have
to find a boat.

09:03.118 --> 09:06.922
You stay here, okay?
I'll go find him.

09:34.683 --> 09:37.186
George?

10:19.395 --> 10:21.196
Hey!

10:21.230 --> 10:24.133
George?

11:04.406 --> 11:06.408
Don't be frightened, dear.

11:09.311 --> 11:11.380
It's only me.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.450
My, my.

11:14.483 --> 11:15.984
Hello.

11:16.018 --> 11:18.554
I'm trying
to find the caretaker.

11:18.587 --> 11:21.156
My mother's grave was destroyed.

11:21.190 --> 11:23.325
Do you know
where I can find him?

11:23.358 --> 11:28.230
You look like an angel,
a frightened angel like before.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.098
What do you mean?

11:30.132 --> 11:34.603
I saw you at the funeral
from a distance.

11:34.636 --> 11:37.139
They call me Miss Emily.

11:37.172 --> 11:40.275
I own the flower shop
on Main Street,

11:40.309 --> 11:43.479
and I help care
for these graves.

11:43.512 --> 11:46.482
Did you know her?

11:46.515 --> 11:50.118
My dear, didn't she...

11:58.694 --> 12:00.462
Are you all right?

12:04.166 --> 12:06.401
The caretaker,
have you seen him?

12:09.438 --> 12:12.608
I'm sorry. I must be going.

12:12.641 --> 12:15.110
A storm's coming.

12:15.143 --> 12:20.282
I saw someone walking amongst
the tombstones over there.

12:33.362 --> 12:35.230
Hey!

12:35.264 --> 12:37.466
Hey!

13:15.704 --> 13:17.807
Hey!

13:18.841 --> 13:21.343
What are you doing?

13:22.611 --> 13:25.180
Did you find him?

13:31.320 --> 13:33.555
Come back here!

13:42.932 --> 13:45.133
George!

14:20.937 --> 14:24.306
George!

15:24.299 --> 15:26.401
Hey!

16:38.808 --> 16:40.609
Hey!

16:42.744 --> 16:44.446
Hello?

16:45.848 --> 16:47.917
Hello?

16:47.950 --> 16:49.952
George?

16:49.986 --> 16:51.720
Hey!

16:51.753 --> 16:53.089
Where were you?

16:53.122 --> 16:56.691
- Where were you?
- I was looking for you.

16:56.725 --> 16:59.561
You didn't hear me?

16:59.929 --> 17:01.463
Did you see them?

17:01.496 --> 17:03.032
Who?

17:03.065 --> 17:05.367
The people there?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.804
What? No. What people?

17:07.837 --> 17:09.504
You didn't go in the woods?

17:09.538 --> 17:11.373
I was back there.

17:13.542 --> 17:16.344
Are you okay?

17:16.378 --> 17:18.413
You couldn't find the guy?

17:18.446 --> 17:21.583
No, I went to the office,
and I don't know.

17:21.616 --> 17:22.919
I mean, I think we need

17:22.952 --> 17:24.753
to get across the bridge
before it closes.

17:24.787 --> 17:27.089
I can't leave her grave
like that.

17:27.123 --> 17:30.358
Well, I mean, it's possible
we missed the guy.

17:30.392 --> 17:31.636
Why would he say to
get here immediately

17:31.660 --> 17:33.428
if he wasn't gonna be here?

17:33.461 --> 17:34.931
I don't know, you know?

17:34.964 --> 17:37.699
But there's a restaurant
we passed a couple miles back.

17:37.732 --> 17:40.870
I mean, we could go ask?

17:40.903 --> 17:42.038
Yeah.

17:42.071 --> 17:43.806
What is up with you?

17:43.840 --> 17:46.075
I don't know. Let's go.

18:43.966 --> 18:46.002
Excuse us.

18:46.035 --> 18:50.072
Um, we're trying to find
the cemetery caretaker.

18:50.106 --> 18:51.740
Haskel?

18:51.773 --> 18:53.142
Sorry?

18:53.175 --> 18:54.944
Haskel?

18:55.945 --> 18:58.114
He told us to come. It's urgent.

18:58.147 --> 19:00.548
Both of you?

19:00.582 --> 19:01.817
It's quite urgent.

19:01.851 --> 19:03.461
Is there a number
where we could reach him?

19:03.485 --> 19:05.487
Some kind of direct line?

19:05.520 --> 19:08.791
Lines go down pretty fast
on account of the storms.

19:10.659 --> 19:14.163
Listen, we need to get across
the bridge before it closes,

19:14.196 --> 19:19.501
so is there any help
anyone could provide?

19:19.534 --> 19:21.603
It would be greatly appreciated.

19:32.248 --> 19:35.952
Sure, come on.
I'll try him on the radio.

19:36.618 --> 19:37.618
This way.

19:38.821 --> 19:40.957
Wait here. I'll be back.

19:56.872 --> 19:59.641
Well, now, it looks like
you sure could use a drink.

20:03.611 --> 20:05.147
No, thank you.

20:07.749 --> 20:10.886
You know, it's a damn shame
what happened.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.521
This island ain't very big.

20:13.555 --> 20:15.623
Everybody knows everything.

20:18.127 --> 20:20.129
Do you know who did it?

20:20.162 --> 20:22.264
- Didn't anybody tell...
- Henry!

20:22.298 --> 20:24.566
Okay, all right.

20:24.934 --> 20:26.634
Caught me.

20:29.138 --> 20:31.673
I'm the last man out this year.

20:32.741 --> 20:33.943
What does that mean?

20:33.976 --> 20:35.911
Well, that means
if you find yourself here

20:35.945 --> 20:39.982
longer than you expect, why
don't you come pay me a visit?

20:40.016 --> 20:43.953
My house is just down
the road there, number 24.

20:43.986 --> 20:48.690
I'll be up real late,
later than everybody else.

20:48.723 --> 20:51.093
I'll leave the light on
just in case.

20:51.127 --> 20:54.696
Key under the mat.
I got my own boat.

20:54.729 --> 20:57.233
I'll be a real friend to you.

20:57.266 --> 20:59.802
Yeah? You're gonna be my friend?

20:59.835 --> 21:02.304
I could be.

21:02.338 --> 21:03.939
Tell me who did it.

21:03.973 --> 21:05.317
Well, you ain't too good
at listenin', now are you?

21:05.341 --> 21:06.852
- Now I've tried...
- All right now, come on.

21:06.876 --> 21:08.320
- Come on, come on.
- All right, all right.

21:08.344 --> 21:11.180
Your hands off me.

21:11.213 --> 21:12.782
Everything okay?

21:12.815 --> 21:15.717
Oh, everything is fine,
Mr. Wonderful.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.585
Peachy fucking keen.

21:19.822 --> 21:21.991
We didn't reach him.

21:22.024 --> 21:24.360
Does anyone know where
we can find the caretaker?

21:26.761 --> 21:29.065
Did you check the cemetery?

21:46.382 --> 21:48.818
Let's go.

22:14.276 --> 22:16.812
What did he say to you?

22:20.950 --> 22:23.052
Had you met that guy?

22:23.085 --> 22:24.787
No.

22:27.356 --> 22:29.158
Why did he act like he knew you?

22:33.395 --> 22:36.232
This caretaker guy
better be dead.

22:39.168 --> 22:42.037
Something's wrong here.

22:42.071 --> 22:44.073
Something's really wrong.

22:45.975 --> 22:48.743
Well, what do you want to do?

22:48.777 --> 22:51.147
She didn't want to
come back here.

22:51.180 --> 22:52.747
What?

22:52.781 --> 22:55.050
She didn't want to
be buried here.

22:55.084 --> 22:56.952
She tried to tell me.

22:56.986 --> 23:01.290
She was right, there's something
wrong with this place.

23:01.323 --> 23:04.026
She didn't want to
come back here.

23:13.402 --> 23:16.338
Hey!

23:16.372 --> 23:18.307
Hey, talk to me!

23:20.209 --> 23:22.311
- It's crazy.
- Nothing is too...

23:22.344 --> 23:24.113
Would you just spit it out?

23:24.146 --> 23:26.382
What the fuck is happening
right now?

23:28.384 --> 23:31.020
I think someone
changed her will.

23:43.199 --> 23:47.036
In those last days,
her mind was completely gone.

23:47.069 --> 23:50.072
She was a total stranger.

23:50.105 --> 23:55.477
But one day I woke up,
and she was back,

23:55.511 --> 24:00.249
just like that,
like she never left.

24:00.282 --> 24:02.985
I'd been by her side every day,

24:03.018 --> 24:07.256
but I hadn't seen her lucid
like that in a long time.

24:07.289 --> 24:10.993
We talked about everything,
like old friends,

24:11.026 --> 24:14.396
if you can believe that.

24:14.430 --> 24:18.367
But then...

24:18.400 --> 24:20.970
everything changed.

24:24.106 --> 24:28.911
She begged me not to let them
bury her here.

24:28.944 --> 24:31.146
When I asked why,
you know what she told me?

24:33.882 --> 24:36.952
She said, that the people
on this island

24:36.986 --> 24:39.355
made a deal with a demon.

24:41.890 --> 24:44.994
She told me that,
a long time ago,

24:45.027 --> 24:46.962
the early settlers
couldn't survive the storms,

24:46.996 --> 24:49.865
and everyone was dying.

24:49.898 --> 24:52.167
Whole families were wiped out.

24:52.201 --> 24:58.874
Until one day, when a man
crawled out of the ocean

24:58.907 --> 25:00.476
and offered them a deal.

25:02.478 --> 25:09.084
She said, her family,
our family,

25:09.118 --> 25:12.354
was part of this pact.

25:15.224 --> 25:18.560
I know.

25:18.594 --> 25:21.063
I know how this sounds.

25:21.096 --> 25:23.899
I was angry with myself
for believing even for a second

25:23.932 --> 25:28.203
that she was back,
that it was her again.

25:32.274 --> 25:33.852
But then suddenly
it says in her will that

25:33.876 --> 25:36.211
she wants to be buried here?

25:36.245 --> 25:38.547
And then her grave
gets all smashed.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.191
And then they call me down here
right before

25:40.215 --> 25:42.618
they're about
to lock the bridge?

25:42.651 --> 25:45.354
What if this is
some kind of trap?

25:45.387 --> 25:46.922
Jesus.

25:46.955 --> 25:50.092
George, what if this
is some kind of trap?

26:03.572 --> 26:06.208
I'm sorry. I...

26:06.241 --> 26:09.945
I shouldn't have told you that.
I shouldn't have told you that.

26:09.978 --> 26:12.514
I can't believe
I just told you that.

26:12.548 --> 26:14.483
I can't believe I just
told you that.

26:18.654 --> 26:21.056
What?

26:28.931 --> 26:30.666
- Hey!
- What?

26:30.699 --> 26:32.167
Well, are you
gonna say anything?

26:34.136 --> 26:35.313
What would you like me to say?

26:35.337 --> 26:37.072
I spent two days
in a car with you,

26:37.106 --> 26:39.942
and you don't say shit,
and, suddenly, tonight,

26:39.975 --> 26:42.344
you're laying demons
and sea creatures on me.

26:42.378 --> 26:44.613
- I mean, what the fuck?
- How do you tell someone that?

26:44.646 --> 26:46.081
Why didn't you tell me
any of this?

26:46.115 --> 26:47.158
How do you tell someone that?

26:47.182 --> 26:48.984
When it was actually happening,

26:49.017 --> 26:50.995
I didn't think you were ever
gonna talk to me again anyway.

26:51.019 --> 26:54.189
I thought maybe we could
just start over?

26:54.223 --> 26:56.125
- You could've called me?
- I did.

26:56.158 --> 26:59.027
Not now, then.

26:59.061 --> 27:00.662
You didn't have to deal
with that alone.

27:00.696 --> 27:03.365
- Yeah, what were you gonna do?
- Sitting in room a with her,

27:03.399 --> 27:08.470
listening to this nonsense
day after day, over and over.

27:08.504 --> 27:12.241
I shouldn't have dragged you
into this.

27:12.274 --> 27:14.109
I'm sorry.

27:16.545 --> 27:20.382
I mean, just to be clear,
her mind was gone.

27:20.416 --> 27:21.683
You know?

27:21.717 --> 27:25.220
You know how crazy
that shit sounds, right?

27:25.254 --> 27:27.389
Yeah. I just...

27:28.657 --> 27:30.959
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:30.993 --> 27:33.695
Me too.

27:33.729 --> 27:36.498
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:36.532 --> 27:37.966
- I mean it.
- I know.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.135
Can we please get
the fuck out of here?

27:40.169 --> 27:41.637
Yes.

28:12.367 --> 28:17.539
When we get back to New York,

28:17.573 --> 28:21.043
I'm not sure what
you've been dealing with

28:21.076 --> 28:23.145
in terms of logistics
and paperwork,

28:23.178 --> 28:26.682
but if you need help
with anything,

28:26.715 --> 28:29.718
you know, you should
feel free to ask.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.387
Thanks. Uh...

28:38.795 --> 28:41.263
I'm gonna sell her house
on Block Island,

28:41.296 --> 28:44.399
but maybe we could spend
the weekend there

28:44.433 --> 28:48.036
before I put it on the market.

28:48.070 --> 28:49.505
Yeah.

28:49.538 --> 28:51.240
Really?

28:53.442 --> 28:57.780
Yeah, that sounds great.

29:08.557 --> 29:10.459
Jesus.

29:19.535 --> 29:21.603
Hold on.

29:32.548 --> 29:34.116
What the...

29:36.485 --> 29:38.353
- This is the way we came?
- It has to be.

29:38.387 --> 29:40.088
You didn't make any other turns?

29:40.122 --> 29:41.800
There's been one road
we've been on the entire time.

29:41.824 --> 29:43.584
Well, turn around!
We got to get out of here.

29:56.538 --> 29:59.241
No! What the fuck is going on?

29:59.274 --> 30:00.618
- There, there! There!
- No, we did not come

30:00.642 --> 30:01.878
from that way!

30:01.911 --> 30:04.479
- There's nowhere else to go.
- Jesus!

30:09.919 --> 30:11.854
No, no, no, no!
What is happening right now?

30:11.888 --> 30:13.455
Watch out!

30:18.895 --> 30:21.163
<i>The Weather Service
Forecast for New York City.</i>

30:21.196 --> 30:24.399
<i>11:00 a.m., Central Broadway.</i>

30:29.237 --> 30:31.406
Price and Price, please hold.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.785
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,
I know, I know,

30:32.809 --> 30:34.443
but the secretary's
not in today, okay?

30:34.476 --> 30:36.645
Give me one second, please.

30:36.678 --> 30:39.214
Price and Price. Hey.

30:39.247 --> 30:41.149
I'm like literally drowning here

30:41.183 --> 30:42.694
because the girl
who's supposed to be here

30:42.718 --> 30:44.696
just got back from like a trip
from France or something,

30:44.720 --> 30:46.722
and we were
in the conference room,

30:46.755 --> 30:48.523
and she was talking,
and then she got sick.

30:53.930 --> 30:58.367
I want you to know that my
life truly has been a dream,

30:58.400 --> 31:01.303
and I want to thank each and...

31:01.336 --> 31:03.739
One second. Ms. Aldrich?

31:03.772 --> 31:05.842
Yeah, they're ready for you.

31:09.979 --> 31:11.814
Ms. Aldrich, we understand
that you're upset.

31:11.848 --> 31:15.350
I'm not upset.
I'm telling you what she said.

31:15.384 --> 31:16.752
She didn't want this.

31:16.786 --> 31:18.520
In fact, she begged me
not to let it happen.

31:18.553 --> 31:19.765
I've got a copy of her
will right here.

31:19.789 --> 31:21.556
I know what the will says.

31:21.590 --> 31:23.936
I'm telling you that it's wrong.
She never visited the place.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.694
She never talked about it
my whole life.

31:25.727 --> 31:28.363
She never mentioned it.
This doesn't make any sense.

31:28.397 --> 31:30.298
Be that as it may,
we can't just take

31:30.332 --> 31:31.676
- the word of her daughter.
- It's not my word!

31:31.700 --> 31:34.236
Especially when it's written
into the will.

31:34.269 --> 31:35.805
That's the law.

31:35.838 --> 31:38.473
Plus, we have
to consider the press.

31:38.507 --> 31:40.308
- The press?
- They'll say

31:40.342 --> 31:43.880
Ava Aldrich's problem child
is trying to change her will.

31:43.913 --> 31:45.948
Everybody will assume
it's about inheritance.

31:45.982 --> 31:47.382
We sympathize with you.

31:47.416 --> 31:49.251
We truly do,
but we don't want this

31:49.284 --> 31:51.720
to become more complicated
than it already is.

31:51.753 --> 31:52.989
We're thinking of you here.

31:53.022 --> 31:54.432
- That's right.
- I don't give a shit

31:54.456 --> 31:55.992
what anybody says about me.

31:56.025 --> 31:57.894
I'm not some problem child.

31:57.927 --> 31:59.628
- We never...
- She begged me

31:59.661 --> 32:02.531
right until the very end,
even when she was

32:02.564 --> 32:04.901
in and out of consciousness,
even when she couldn't form

32:04.934 --> 32:07.602
a single fucking sentence,
over and over,

32:07.636 --> 32:10.338
she kept repeating,
"Don't take me back there."

32:10.372 --> 32:14.242
Ms. Aldrich. The law is the law.

32:20.382 --> 32:23.986
- It's quite beautiful, you know?
- What is?

32:24.020 --> 32:26.923
The island.

32:26.956 --> 32:28.825
You'll see.

32:38.067 --> 32:41.871
Price and Price.

32:41.904 --> 32:44.406
I'm sorry, please hold.

32:51.480 --> 32:52.782
Price and Price.

34:30.780 --> 34:32.614
George?

34:35.617 --> 34:38.587
George?

35:19.829 --> 35:21.998
No!

35:30.739 --> 35:32.774
Help!

35:34.509 --> 35:36.178
Anybody?

36:08.643 --> 36:10.578
Hello?!

36:18.687 --> 36:20.455
Hello?

36:42.244 --> 36:44.814
I need help!

37:19.949 --> 37:21.017
Hello?

37:29.291 --> 37:31.760
<i>Thank you for calling your.</i>

37:36.698 --> 37:39.101
<i>We are closed for the season</i>

37:39.135 --> 37:41.736
<i>and re-open the first day
in spring.</i>

37:41.770 --> 37:44.240
<i>Please leave a detailed message.</i>

37:44.273 --> 37:45.875
<i>See you next season.</i>

37:45.908 --> 37:47.642
<i>Thank you. Goodbye.</i>

38:17.306 --> 38:19.607
Hello?

38:38.027 --> 38:39.995
Hello?

39:08.290 --> 39:10.359
<i>First there was nothing,</i>

39:54.769 --> 39:57.406
Have you angered God?

39:57.439 --> 40:00.009
Have you angered God?

40:50.526 --> 40:52.127
Come on.

40:53.429 --> 40:55.965
Fuck!

41:55.457 --> 41:57.860
You know
you're not supposed to smoke.

41:57.893 --> 42:01.130
His darling girl
always talking back.

42:01.163 --> 42:03.432
What's a mother supposed to do?

42:03.465 --> 42:05.167
You know, sometimes, I wish

42:05.200 --> 42:08.270
they'd stay a certain age.

42:08.304 --> 42:11.073
It's just you and me, Ma.
No one's watching.

42:11.106 --> 42:12.841
Don't talk to me like that.

42:12.875 --> 42:14.043
And don't call me, Ma.

42:14.076 --> 42:16.278
"Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma." Grow up!

42:16.312 --> 42:17.980
Okay. You don't need to do that.

42:18.013 --> 42:19.948
And talkin' to me
like I'm some kinda asshole.

42:19.982 --> 42:21.550
Don't you know
what I've done for you?

42:21.583 --> 42:23.986
Did you not hear
the story I told you?

42:24.019 --> 42:25.220
I heard you.

42:25.254 --> 42:26.588
Did you hear anything I said?

42:26.622 --> 42:28.324
I heard you.

42:28.357 --> 42:30.225
Did you read it in a story
or something?

42:30.259 --> 42:31.860
One of the screenplays
they send you?

42:31.894 --> 42:33.571
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Were you acting?

42:33.595 --> 42:35.497
- No.
- You were telling me the truth?

42:35.531 --> 42:38.067
- You were never grateful.
- Were are you acting?

42:38.100 --> 42:40.302
- Never were.
- Were you acting?

42:40.336 --> 42:41.970
I'm not!

42:42.004 --> 42:43.572
Tell me the truth.

42:43.605 --> 42:45.641
- Are <i>you</i> acting?
- You were telling me the truth?

42:45.674 --> 42:47.242
- Are you acting?
- Ma, please, stop.

42:47.276 --> 42:49.278
Are you acting,
or are you telling me the truth?

42:49.311 --> 42:50.488
Calm down! Can you be
straight with me for once?

42:50.512 --> 42:51.523
- Are you acting.
- For once!

42:51.547 --> 42:52.981
Or are you telling me the truth?

42:53.015 --> 42:55.551
- Ma! Stop! Stop!
- Please! Tell me!

43:00.956 --> 43:03.158
Is the story real or not?

43:03.192 --> 43:07.463
I have never acted around you.

43:07.496 --> 43:09.898
- Ma, please...
- Don't call me ma!

43:43.298 --> 43:44.933
<i>They call me Ms. Emily.</i>

43:46.268 --> 43:48.470
I own the flower shop
on Main Street.

44:04.753 --> 44:07.322
Ms. Emily?

44:07.356 --> 44:09.458
There's been an accident.

44:11.360 --> 44:13.295
I need help.

44:15.330 --> 44:17.032
Are you here?

44:19.468 --> 44:21.236
Hello?

44:33.215 --> 44:34.550
Hello?

44:48.630 --> 44:51.033
Are you there?

45:49.625 --> 45:52.194
Ms. Emily?

45:52.227 --> 45:54.096
Thank God.

45:54.129 --> 45:55.631
There's been an accident.

45:55.664 --> 45:58.400
I need to call for help.

45:58.433 --> 46:00.536
Where is everyone?

46:02.638 --> 46:04.072
Did you hear me?

46:05.307 --> 46:06.642
Ms. Emily?

46:08.577 --> 46:10.112
Hey!

46:16.318 --> 46:18.453
What's wrong with you?

46:20.722 --> 46:22.491
What's wrong with you?

46:24.393 --> 46:26.495
What's wrong with you?!

48:46.601 --> 48:49.204
Shhh.

48:52.474 --> 48:53.709
Come on.

48:55.912 --> 48:57.279
Come on.

49:02.051 --> 49:04.352
What other choice you got?

49:21.670 --> 49:24.040
You never should
have come back here.

49:24.073 --> 49:25.741
Have you seen
the man that I was with?

49:25.774 --> 49:27.342
Nope.

49:27.375 --> 49:28.744
But if he ain't dead,

49:28.777 --> 49:31.513
you better hope
they ain't found him either.

49:31.546 --> 49:33.315
Shh.

49:36.786 --> 49:38.487
What's wrong with these people?

49:38.520 --> 49:40.722
Ain't nothin' wrong
with these people.

49:40.756 --> 49:42.792
They're just cursed is all.

49:42.825 --> 49:44.526
Whole damn island's cursed.

49:44.559 --> 49:46.294
The place is evil.

49:46.328 --> 49:48.663
He trapped us all here
a long time ago.

49:48.697 --> 49:50.699
That's why they brought
your mother back.

49:50.732 --> 49:53.035
She's got a contract to fulfill,

49:53.069 --> 49:56.505
a debt to pay to him.

49:56.538 --> 49:59.608
A man from the sea?

49:59.641 --> 50:02.711
Did she tell you about him?

50:02.744 --> 50:04.446
She tried to... at the end.

50:04.479 --> 50:05.858
Then why the hell
did you come back here?

50:05.882 --> 50:07.549
Because it sounded
too insane to be true.

50:07.582 --> 50:09.085
Aah.

50:09.118 --> 50:10.552
Where are we going?

50:10.585 --> 50:11.854
Listen, the tourist season

50:11.888 --> 50:13.455
brings the sunshine, right?

50:13.488 --> 50:14.924
Sunshine brings people.

50:14.957 --> 50:16.658
People have all this energy,

50:16.691 --> 50:18.527
and also,
we harvest that energy,

50:18.560 --> 50:21.596
and then when everybody leaves,
well, that's when he feeds.

50:21.630 --> 50:23.365
"Feeds"... What does that mean?

50:23.398 --> 50:25.467
Take a look down, darlin'.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.937
You've been standin' on 'em
since you got here.

50:29.939 --> 50:33.542
He just sucks it out of 'em,
you know?

50:33.575 --> 50:35.710
Leaves 'em all dried up,
desiccated,

50:35.744 --> 50:38.815
like a mummy in a museum,

50:38.848 --> 50:40.382
a statue or something,

50:40.415 --> 50:41.760
till someone comes along
and disturbs 'em.

50:41.784 --> 50:43.351
Then what the fuck are you?

50:43.385 --> 50:46.122
I'm the same as the rest of 'em!

50:46.155 --> 50:48.523
But every year,
somebody's gotta stay awake.

50:48.557 --> 50:50.126
This year,
I made sure it was me.

50:50.159 --> 50:52.028
Why?

50:52.061 --> 50:55.064
Oh, my God. You don't...

50:55.097 --> 50:58.868
Oh, you don't recognize me
at all, do you?

50:58.901 --> 51:00.937
No.

51:00.970 --> 51:02.504
Just tell me who you are.

51:02.537 --> 51:05.842
God, man. She didn't say
one word about me.

51:05.875 --> 51:07.642
No matter anyway.

51:10.545 --> 51:13.748
That's my house over there.

51:13.783 --> 51:16.152
I'll get you to the boat
and get you to the mainland.

51:16.185 --> 51:18.054
I can't leave here without him.

51:18.087 --> 51:19.387
Ready?

51:19.421 --> 51:21.456
Come on, let's go!

51:40.508 --> 51:41.676
Listen to me.

51:41.710 --> 51:43.545
The keys to my boat,

51:43.578 --> 51:45.423
they're in a chest of drawers
in the second room over there.

51:45.447 --> 51:46.724
- Did they follow us?
- I don't know.

51:46.748 --> 51:49.952
Go get the keys!
Go get the keys!

52:12.474 --> 52:13.675
Alright.

52:13.708 --> 52:15.477
Okay. Let's go! Let's go!

52:15.510 --> 52:16.855
- We're going to the boat!
- Hang on a second! Wait, wait!

52:16.879 --> 52:18.446
- No, we're not waiting.
- Listen to me.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.958
We're only gonna get one shot
at this, alright?

52:19.982 --> 52:21.093
Now, I'm the driver
of the damn boat.

52:21.117 --> 52:22.550
Do you know how to drive a boat?

52:22.584 --> 52:23.953
No.

52:23.986 --> 52:25.620
Shh.

52:33.062 --> 52:34.806
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- No, let's get outta here.

52:34.830 --> 52:36.065
Wait, wait, wait.

52:37.867 --> 52:39.534
What?

52:39.567 --> 52:40.937
No, no, no, no.

52:40.970 --> 52:43.672
Listen, you keep your eye
on that door, okay?

52:43.705 --> 52:45.549
- I'm gonna go ups there...
- No, don't go up there!

52:45.573 --> 52:47.944
Just listen to me, alright?
Keep your eye on the door.

52:47.977 --> 52:49.511
And don't come up here
until I tell ya.

52:49.544 --> 52:51.213
It's my goddamn house.

52:51.247 --> 52:53.182
My goddamn boat.

52:59.088 --> 53:01.023
What's up there?

53:03.192 --> 53:05.227
Hey!

53:09.631 --> 53:11.033
Hey!

53:14.736 --> 53:15.905
Answer me!

53:20.176 --> 53:23.079
What was that?

53:40.628 --> 53:42.999
Hey!

53:51.307 --> 53:52.908
Hey!

54:00.682 --> 54:02.018
Where are you?

54:12.294 --> 54:13.996
Oh.

54:14.030 --> 54:16.132
Answer me!

54:23.738 --> 54:25.841
Jesus Christ.

54:31.981 --> 54:33.215
Hey!

54:38.653 --> 54:40.588
Answer me!

55:29.939 --> 55:31.307
Hello?

55:31.340 --> 55:33.209
Is anybody there?

55:33.242 --> 55:35.111
I need help.

55:35.144 --> 55:36.912
Come on.

55:37.413 --> 55:38.948
Come on, come on, come on!

55:38.981 --> 55:40.149
Hello?

55:40.182 --> 55:42.384
Anybody?

55:42.418 --> 55:45.121
Come on. Hello?

55:45.154 --> 55:47.722
- <i>Marie?</i>
- George?

55:47.755 --> 55:48.924
George, where are you?

55:48.958 --> 55:50.226
<i>At the bridge.</i>

55:50.259 --> 55:52.128
George, I can't hear you.

55:52.161 --> 55:54.263
Talk to me. Where are you?

55:54.296 --> 55:56.664
I can't hear you.

55:56.698 --> 55:58.200
<i>The bridge.</i>

55:58.234 --> 56:00.102
Where are you?

56:00.136 --> 56:02.171
<i>Bridge. To the bridge, hurry.</i>

56:02.204 --> 56:03.873
Okay, stay there! I'm coming!

57:09.939 --> 57:11.340
No!

59:44.693 --> 59:46.295
George?

59:48.230 --> 59:49.998
There you are.

59:50.032 --> 59:52.301
I thought I lost you.
Where were you?

59:54.503 --> 59:56.405
What happened to you?

59:56.438 --> 1:00:00.442
I was scared,
too, but it's okay.

1:00:02.244 --> 1:00:04.113
What do you mean, it's okay?

1:00:04.146 --> 1:00:05.614
It's good.

1:00:07.616 --> 1:00:09.518
What are you talking about?

1:00:09.551 --> 1:00:12.888
This place is good.
I promise it's good.

1:00:18.193 --> 1:00:21.263
Who are you?

1:00:21.296 --> 1:00:23.432
Who am I?

1:00:23.465 --> 1:00:28.337
How could you ask me that?

1:00:33.041 --> 1:00:34.977
He was a good person.

1:00:37.312 --> 1:00:40.983
He didn't do anything wrong!
Why did you do this to him?

1:00:42.651 --> 1:00:44.420
To show you.

1:00:46.321 --> 1:00:48.524
He begged for salvation.

1:00:48.557 --> 1:00:51.026
<i>I</i> am salvation.

1:00:52.661 --> 1:00:55.697
What are you?

1:00:55.731 --> 1:00:58.467
This place...

1:00:58.500 --> 1:01:02.271
people here are my fingers.

1:01:02.304 --> 1:01:05.441
Island is the palm of my hand.

1:01:07.543 --> 1:01:09.511
In life, they have free will,

1:01:09.545 --> 1:01:13.682
but in death, they belong to me.

1:01:13.715 --> 1:01:15.584
You belong to me.

1:01:15.617 --> 1:01:18.020
What about my mother?

1:01:23.793 --> 1:01:26.762
What are you gonna do to her?

1:01:26.796 --> 1:01:29.264
Fate worse than hell.

1:01:32.768 --> 1:01:36.472
Don't be scared, my child.

1:01:36.505 --> 1:01:38.273
You belong to me.

1:02:58.620 --> 1:03:00.389
Uh...

1:03:37.492 --> 1:03:39.595
<i>The causeway drawbridge...</i>

1:03:47.636 --> 1:03:49.404
Come on.

1:03:52.174 --> 1:03:54.710
<i>Operating the bridge is
as easy as driving a car,</i>

1:03:54.743 --> 1:03:56.612
<i>boat, or commercial truck.</i>

1:03:56.645 --> 1:03:58.513
<i>To lower the bridge...</i>

1:04:30.947 --> 1:04:32.314
Yes.

1:04:35.785 --> 1:04:38.587
Come on.

1:05:24.766 --> 1:05:27.536
Oh, wait.

1:05:29.939 --> 1:05:31.540
Can't let you go, miss.

1:05:31.573 --> 1:05:34.309
No! No.

1:05:34.342 --> 1:05:35.845
I know who you are.

1:05:35.878 --> 1:05:39.715
Knew since the moment I saw you.

1:05:39.748 --> 1:05:42.718
Your mother did terrible things.

1:05:42.751 --> 1:05:44.720
He wants you to see
what happens.

1:05:44.753 --> 1:05:46.022
She didn't do anything wrong!

1:05:46.055 --> 1:05:48.858
She left!

1:05:48.891 --> 1:05:51.359
She turned her back
on this place.

1:05:53.495 --> 1:05:55.764
I've been waiting my whole life,

1:05:55.798 --> 1:05:58.433
serving them, protecting them,

1:05:58.467 --> 1:06:01.971
making sure nobody came in
when they weren't supposed to.

1:06:02.004 --> 1:06:05.474
I worked so fucking hard

1:06:05.507 --> 1:06:06.675
for salvation,

1:06:06.708 --> 1:06:10.612
salvation that
she was born with,

1:06:10.645 --> 1:06:13.615
and she just goes
and throws it away.

1:06:16.052 --> 1:06:19.521
I mean...

1:06:19.554 --> 1:06:22.792
how can somebody
just leave heaven?

1:06:22.825 --> 1:06:24.426
You don't know
what you're doing.

1:06:24.459 --> 1:06:26.628
I don't?

1:06:26.661 --> 1:06:28.865
I don't?

1:06:28.898 --> 1:06:32.734
I don't fucking know
what I'm doing?

1:06:32.768 --> 1:06:36.404
I need you to listen to me.

1:06:36.438 --> 1:06:38.306
That place isn't heaven.

1:06:40.675 --> 1:06:42.377
Don't say that.

1:06:44.579 --> 1:06:46.048
It's true.

1:06:46.082 --> 1:06:47.950
Stop.

1:06:47.984 --> 1:06:49.518
That place is hell.

1:06:49.551 --> 1:06:51.753
Stop it,

1:06:54.389 --> 1:06:57.459
I've seen what they become.

1:06:57.492 --> 1:06:59.996
They're trapped.

1:07:00.029 --> 1:07:03.900
I'm sorry, but you were tricked.

1:07:03.933 --> 1:07:07.402
They've all been tricked!

1:07:07.435 --> 1:07:10.039
I promise you.

1:07:10.072 --> 1:07:11.373
Just let me go!

1:07:11.406 --> 1:07:12.975
I said, stop!

1:07:15.443 --> 1:07:16.913
Stop!

1:07:21.951 --> 1:07:23.718
I can kill you,

1:07:23.752 --> 1:07:25.788
and yous just gonna
come right back

1:07:25.822 --> 1:07:28.490
like the rest of them...

1:07:28.523 --> 1:07:30.827
'cause you're one of 'em.

1:07:30.860 --> 1:07:32.862
Everybody knows it.

1:07:32.895 --> 1:07:35.064
I can pay you.

1:07:35.097 --> 1:07:36.698
Name your price.

1:07:41.469 --> 1:07:46.775
Have you heard one
goddamn thing that I've said?

1:07:46.809 --> 1:07:48.144
Have you been listenin'?

1:07:48.177 --> 1:07:52.081
'Cause I don't want any money.

1:07:52.114 --> 1:07:55.450
I don't want no fucking money!

1:07:56.718 --> 1:07:59.454
I just want life.

1:07:59.487 --> 1:08:02.724
I just want life after death.

1:08:02.757 --> 1:08:03.692
Fuck you!

1:08:03.725 --> 1:08:05.928
Fuck me?! Fuck me?!

1:08:05.962 --> 1:08:08.865
Fuck me?!

1:08:08.898 --> 1:08:12.500
Well, you're gonna come with me.

1:08:12.534 --> 1:08:16.839
Or I'm gonna shoot you,
and it's gonna hurt.

1:08:16.873 --> 1:08:20.109
But you're gonna
come back real quick,

1:08:20.142 --> 1:08:21.710
'cause it's that
time of the year.

1:08:21.743 --> 1:08:23.946
So you're gonna
come back real quick.

1:08:27.950 --> 1:08:30.685
Eternal life.

1:08:30.719 --> 1:08:34.689
Eternal salvation.

1:08:35.925 --> 1:08:38.828
He's waiting.

1:08:57.679 --> 1:09:01.083
I hate to say it, missy, but...

1:09:01.117 --> 1:09:04.186
your mom made some good movies.

1:09:15.164 --> 1:09:17.066
Don't go thinkin'
about runnin' or nothin',

1:09:17.099 --> 1:09:21.037
'cause I'm a pretty good shot
for an old man.

1:09:25.041 --> 1:09:26.574
You're a lucky girl.

1:09:26.608 --> 1:09:30.179
You know that?

1:09:30.212 --> 1:09:33.715
I'd trade places with you
any day.

1:09:57.605 --> 1:09:59.275
Go on.

1:09:59.308 --> 1:10:01.877
I'm not allowed any further.

1:10:01.911 --> 1:10:04.646
Not yet anyway.

1:10:08.985 --> 1:10:10.719
Is this really what you want?

1:10:10.752 --> 1:10:12.687
More than anything.

1:10:14.890 --> 1:10:16.225
Then, go on.

1:12:13.175 --> 1:12:14.944
Ma?

1:12:23.886 --> 1:12:25.821
Ma?

1:12:34.762 --> 1:12:36.332
This is a nightmare.

1:12:43.005 --> 1:12:45.274
Are you my old friend?

1:12:52.481 --> 1:12:53.916
Wait!

1:14:03.419 --> 1:14:05.888
I'm sorry!

1:14:44.226 --> 1:14:46.962
She said that
the people on this island

1:14:46.996 --> 1:14:49.265
made a deal with a demon.

1:14:51.300 --> 1:14:53.335
I see.

1:14:53.369 --> 1:14:55.170
I see now.

1:14:55.204 --> 1:14:58.073
<i>She told me that...
a long time ago,</i>

1:14:58.107 --> 1:15:00.342
<i>the early settlers
couldn't survive the storms,</i>

1:15:00.376 --> 1:15:03.279
<i>until, one day, when a man</i>

1:15:03.312 --> 1:15:05.814
<i>crawled out of the ocean...</i>

1:15:05.848 --> 1:15:07.883
<i>and offered them a deal.</i>

1:15:07.916 --> 1:15:10.552
<i>He offered them a deal.</i>

1:15:10.586 --> 1:15:13.322
<i>The entire island
is the palm of my hand.</i>

1:15:17.092 --> 1:15:19.428
<i>The island
is the palm of my hand.</i>

1:15:22.931 --> 1:15:24.867
Did you fall asleep?

1:15:27.636 --> 1:15:30.539
Just for a second.

1:15:30.572 --> 1:15:31.940
How are you?

1:15:31.974 --> 1:15:33.309
Good.

1:15:33.342 --> 1:15:35.210
You?

1:15:35.244 --> 1:15:36.979
Good.

1:15:37.012 --> 1:15:39.982
I ever tell you I had a brother?

1:15:41.950 --> 1:15:43.352
You had a brother?

1:15:43.385 --> 1:15:45.187
Yeah.

1:15:46.088 --> 1:15:47.856
He was older than me.

1:15:50.125 --> 1:15:51.360
What happened?

1:15:51.393 --> 1:15:54.596
Oh, they never told me
what happened.

1:15:54.630 --> 1:15:57.366
They thought I was too little
to know.

1:15:57.399 --> 1:15:59.501
Of course,
I overheard conversations,

1:15:59.535 --> 1:16:02.004
and I pieced things together.

1:16:04.239 --> 1:16:06.075
He drowned.

1:16:06.108 --> 1:16:08.911
He was a good swimmer, too,
but he drowned.

1:16:13.082 --> 1:16:15.351
I loved him more

1:16:15.384 --> 1:16:18.520
than anything
in the whole world,

1:16:18.554 --> 1:16:21.256
and he was gone just like that.

1:16:26.562 --> 1:16:29.998
But one day, after the funeral,

1:16:30.032 --> 1:16:31.367
it was late at night,

1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:33.235
I was in my room,

1:16:33.268 --> 1:16:35.204
and I heard something
outside my window,

1:16:35.237 --> 1:16:37.072
and I looked,

1:16:37.106 --> 1:16:40.042
and there he was.

1:16:40.075 --> 1:16:42.244
So I followed him.

1:16:42.277 --> 1:16:45.514
I followed him into the woods.

1:16:45.547 --> 1:16:47.316
And he turned.

1:16:50.352 --> 1:16:52.287
And he looked at me.

1:16:55.124 --> 1:16:57.059
And I knew it wasn't him.

1:16:59.094 --> 1:17:00.429
I knew it wasn't him,

1:17:00.462 --> 1:17:03.499
and we had made a deal
to go together,

1:17:03.532 --> 1:17:05.667
but that wasn't him.

1:17:05.701 --> 1:17:07.536
So I ran.

1:17:07.569 --> 1:17:08.670
I was frightened.

1:17:08.704 --> 1:17:10.506
I ran as fast as I could.

1:17:10.539 --> 1:17:14.009
I ran, and I never looked back,

1:17:14.042 --> 1:17:18.480
and don't... don't ever
take me back there.

1:17:18.514 --> 1:17:20.949
Don't you ever let anybody
take me back there,

1:17:20.983 --> 1:17:22.351
my ashes, my bones,

1:17:22.384 --> 1:17:24.153
my nothin'.

1:17:27.089 --> 1:17:28.957
Okay.

1:17:28.991 --> 1:17:31.193
Promise.

1:17:31.226 --> 1:17:32.394
I promise.

1:18:01.490 --> 1:18:03.025
Hello?

1:18:03.058 --> 1:18:04.460
Just a minute.

1:18:08.163 --> 1:18:10.065
Oh, hello.

1:18:10.098 --> 1:18:11.333
Hi.

1:18:11.366 --> 1:18:13.569
You two must be
the last ones here.

1:18:13.602 --> 1:18:15.237
Bridge goes up tomorrow.

1:18:15.270 --> 1:18:17.539
We can't seem
to bring ourselves to leave.

1:18:17.573 --> 1:18:20.175
You mean they actually
lock people out of this place?

1:18:20.209 --> 1:18:23.679
Just until spring.
What can I do for you?

1:18:23.712 --> 1:18:25.547
We were hoping to stop here
one last time.

1:18:25.581 --> 1:18:27.416
You have got the most
beautiful flowers,

1:18:27.449 --> 1:18:28.684
if you have any left.

1:18:28.717 --> 1:18:30.285
Oh, thank you.

1:18:30.319 --> 1:18:32.154
My grandmother will be
thrilled to hear that.

1:18:32.187 --> 1:18:34.490
[]

1:18:34.523 --> 1:18:37.059
We wanna take some home
with us, you know, for memories.

1:18:37.092 --> 1:18:38.327
Of course.

1:18:40.395 --> 1:18:41.363
On me.

1:18:41.396 --> 1:18:42.364
Really?

1:18:42.397 --> 1:18:43.699
Thank you so much.

1:18:43.732 --> 1:18:45.167
You're welcome.

1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:47.503
We love this town,
don't we, darling?

1:18:47.536 --> 1:18:49.371
Uh-huh. That's right.

1:18:49.404 --> 1:18:50.772
Well, you can always come back.

1:18:50.807 --> 1:18:53.709
I wish we could stay
here all year round.

1:18:53.742 --> 1:18:56.378
Don't be silly.

1:18:56.411 --> 1:18:58.180
Nobody does that.

1:19:01.149 --> 1:19:02.351
Well...

1:19:02.384 --> 1:19:06.455
thank you again.

1:19:06.488 --> 1:19:07.824
See you next season.
