00:19.436 --> 00:20.869
Grey's hit.

00:20.872 --> 00:23.038
We got to get him out of there!

00:27.281 --> 00:28.943
Where's Barry when you need him?

00:29.626 --> 00:32.527
Just tying up some loose ends.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.430
He's almost at the breach hangar.

00:37.687 --> 00:39.187
If we don't stop him,

00:39.190 --> 00:40.825
he's gonna blow up our only ticket home.

00:40.828 --> 00:42.123
Not to mention us.

00:51.935 --> 00:53.937
A little help with that, please.

01:03.437 --> 01:05.212
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:05.215 --> 01:07.101
Grey! Stay down!

01:08.552 --> 01:10.367
Grey! No!

01:26.002 --> 01:27.602
Grey!

01:27.604 --> 01:29.078
Fall back!

01:29.206 --> 01:30.471
Fall back!

01:41.418 --> 01:42.851
He did it.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.153
- He opened the breach.
- Let's go.

01:45.155 --> 01:47.422
Hey.

01:47.424 --> 01:49.707
Barry, the breach is
open. Where are you?

01:49.710 --> 01:51.492
We got to take him out now.

01:51.494 --> 01:54.254
I have an idea. Throw
another lightning bolt.

01:54.257 --> 01:56.731
- We already tried that.
- Just do it.

02:02.601 --> 02:04.414
Now!

02:20.991 --> 02:22.423
Barry, we need to you to hurry up.

02:22.425 --> 02:23.691
Stein's hurt.

02:23.693 --> 02:25.760
All right, we're on the move.

02:25.762 --> 02:28.062
He's alive, but his
condition is critical.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.597
All right, Gideon will fix him.

02:29.599 --> 02:31.232
No, it's too dangerous to move him.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.134
Not if he's Firestorm.

02:33.136 --> 02:35.336
Yeah.

02:35.338 --> 02:37.138
Grey! Grey.

02:37.140 --> 02:39.307
Grey, come on.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.947
- Thanks for your help.
- We're not done helping yet.

02:45.949 --> 02:47.916
Our enemies are still
on your earth, Ollie.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.421
Don't call me that.

02:49.424 --> 02:51.786
Give it time, I'll get
through that crusty exterior.

02:51.788 --> 02:53.521
No, you really won't.

02:53.523 --> 02:54.684
I was talking to you.

03:15.268 --> 03:17.048
- Oh, my God.
- Kara.

03:23.644 --> 03:25.267
What are they doing?

03:32.285 --> 03:34.519
This next sound...

03:34.521 --> 03:38.957
metal through a bone,

03:38.959 --> 03:41.092
that's my favorite.

03:41.094 --> 03:43.962
You should probably close your eyes.

03:43.964 --> 03:47.198
This will all be over in a minute.

03:55.742 --> 03:58.443
What are you waiting for?

03:58.445 --> 04:01.212
- Do it.
- I'm trying.

04:01.214 --> 04:03.314
I'm trying but...

04:03.316 --> 04:05.118
Mitts off, Mengele.

04:25.872 --> 04:28.640
- Ray?
- Hi, how are you?

04:28.642 --> 04:31.543
Oh, I got your S.O.S.
How was the wedding?

04:33.626 --> 04:35.146
All right, don't worry.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.481
The rest of the Legends
are here and we're busting

04:36.483 --> 04:37.838
- everybody out.
- Wait, we need someone

04:37.840 --> 04:39.583
- to lock the time vault.
- I got it.

04:39.586 --> 04:41.520
- You guys get Kara out of here.
- Be careful.

04:41.523 --> 04:42.804
- Okay.
- Look, I know I'm late

04:42.807 --> 04:44.681
to the party, but why
have Nazi doppelgangers

04:44.684 --> 04:46.057
- taken over S.T.A.R. Labs?
- They're from Earth-X.

04:46.059 --> 04:47.118
They hate everybody.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.190
They want to steal Kara's heart,

04:48.192 --> 04:49.967
and they have this giant robot.

04:49.970 --> 04:52.126
Oh, I've actually fought
one of those before.

04:52.129 --> 04:53.865
Little known fact the
suit doesn't just shrink...

04:53.867 --> 04:55.633
Ray!

04:59.218 --> 05:00.715
It embiggens.

05:01.695 --> 05:04.329
Attention all prisoners:

05:04.332 --> 05:06.811
Great news. The cavalry has arrived.

05:06.813 --> 05:08.346
About time.

05:08.348 --> 05:10.048
I knew I could count on you, Pretty.

05:10.050 --> 05:11.616
Did you bring beers?

05:11.618 --> 05:13.485
Better yet, an army.

05:15.989 --> 05:18.488
Who needs an army when you got Legends?

05:32.939 --> 05:36.875
We have a problem.

05:36.877 --> 05:39.277
I need you to wake up, Kara.

05:42.315 --> 05:45.949
The General is no longer safe here.

05:45.952 --> 05:47.151
I'm well aware.

05:47.154 --> 05:48.653
Retreat to the troop carrier

05:48.655 --> 05:49.988
and prepare for the invasion.

05:49.990 --> 05:51.089
Without you?

05:51.091 --> 05:52.457
I'm staying.

05:52.459 --> 05:54.993
Supergirl is not leaving here alive.

05:54.995 --> 05:56.285
Do not make it personal.

05:56.288 --> 05:58.630
That is not a good idea.

05:58.632 --> 06:01.766
Are you questioning
your Fuhrer's orders?

06:01.768 --> 06:03.368
Of course not.

06:03.370 --> 06:04.910
General.

06:11.987 --> 06:14.535
Stay here. Stay safe.

06:14.538 --> 06:17.272
And I'll be back for you with her heart.

06:19.953 --> 06:22.420
So this is Earth-1? Cute.

06:22.422 --> 06:25.089
- We need to find Kara.
- Then we need to split up.

06:25.091 --> 06:27.826
- I got Supergirl.
- I got Group B.

06:27.828 --> 06:29.794
- You're late.
- Ah, don't mind him.

06:29.796 --> 06:31.796
He's just pissy 'cause he
came out of a steel box.

06:31.798 --> 06:33.565
Actually he's always like this.

06:38.505 --> 06:40.572
What the hell?

06:40.574 --> 06:43.341
- How much further, Ray?
- Waverider's on the roof.

06:43.343 --> 06:44.909
How do you two know each other again?

06:44.911 --> 06:47.282
- We used to date.
- That's... awkward.

06:47.285 --> 06:48.527
Careful.

06:48.530 --> 06:50.448
Oliver got the girl, I
got a life of adventure

06:50.450 --> 06:52.277
on a time-traveling spaceship.

06:59.226 --> 07:01.793
Step away from her.

07:01.795 --> 07:04.785
There's no way.

07:04.788 --> 07:07.332
My grandparents didn't
survive the Holocaust

07:07.334 --> 07:11.236
so the world could be ruled
by Nazis so if you want Kara,

07:11.238 --> 07:12.793
you got to go through me.

07:12.796 --> 07:14.950
And even if you do,
you're not gonna win.

07:14.953 --> 07:17.775
'Cause we will not back
down. We will keep fighting.

07:17.777 --> 07:21.512
So get the hell off our
earth while you still can.

07:21.514 --> 07:23.915
Hm.

07:23.917 --> 07:26.973
As final words go,

07:26.976 --> 07:28.675
those weren't bad.

07:28.678 --> 07:30.878
Lower your weapon.

07:34.219 --> 07:35.863
Or I'll kill her.

07:42.269 --> 07:44.135
This guy's like the Terminator.

07:44.137 --> 07:46.204
Why are you laughing?

07:46.206 --> 07:48.640
I just love a good pop culture reference

07:48.642 --> 07:50.174
in a moment of crisis.

07:50.176 --> 07:51.976
Also, that!

07:58.718 --> 08:00.332
Let's kick some ass!

08:18.438 --> 08:20.538
Her neck doesn't seem invulnerable

08:20.540 --> 08:22.126
so I will say again.

08:22.129 --> 08:24.243
Lower your weapon.

08:24.246 --> 08:26.311
Don't listen to him. Just shoot her.

08:26.313 --> 08:27.918
No! No.

08:27.921 --> 08:29.621
I can save your wife's life.

08:29.624 --> 08:31.749
There's only one way to save me.

08:31.751 --> 08:33.337
We have friends at S.T.A.R. Labs.

08:33.340 --> 08:34.652
There are ways to do this

08:34.654 --> 08:36.854
- without hurting Kara.
- He's lying.

08:36.856 --> 08:39.894
Do it for the Fatherland, just kill her!

08:44.085 --> 08:48.098
I thought that jerk
was supposed to be dead.

08:48.101 --> 08:50.567
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.

08:52.172 --> 08:53.696
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay

08:53.699 --> 08:54.973
You're safe. You're safe.

08:54.975 --> 08:56.207
Oh, I shouldn't have said what I said.

08:56.209 --> 08:57.204
What if it was the last thing

08:57.206 --> 08:58.751
- we ever said to each other?
- It doesn't matter.

08:58.753 --> 09:01.281
Nothing matters except that I love you.

09:01.284 --> 09:02.711
Okay? I don't need anything else.

09:02.714 --> 09:03.851
I don't need to get married.

09:03.854 --> 09:06.416
I just... I just want to be with you.

09:06.419 --> 09:08.464
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:22.304 --> 09:23.670
Gideon, fix him!

09:23.672 --> 09:24.904
His pressure's dropping.

09:24.906 --> 09:26.039
We have to stanch the bleeding.

09:26.041 --> 09:27.607
Right away, Dr. Snow.

09:27.609 --> 09:30.010
Jax, relax.

09:30.012 --> 09:31.144
Professor's going to be fine.

09:31.146 --> 09:32.779
He's a tough bastard.

09:34.082 --> 09:35.996
Jackson's hit.

09:37.653 --> 09:40.085
- I can't find an entry wound.
- Look at their vitals.

09:40.088 --> 09:41.422
It must be because of their connection.

09:41.424 --> 09:42.389
What the hell does that mean?

09:42.391 --> 09:43.790
Even though Jax isn't injured,

09:43.792 --> 09:45.046
their life functions must still

09:45.049 --> 09:46.059
be linked somehow.

09:46.061 --> 09:47.274
Well, how do we unlink them?

09:47.277 --> 09:48.561
We can't.

09:48.563 --> 09:49.896
Their connection's the only thing

09:49.898 --> 09:51.598
keeping the professor alive.

09:53.702 --> 09:56.670
Are you okay?

09:56.672 --> 10:00.507
I can't even begin to
answer that right now.

10:00.509 --> 10:02.876
We should be on our honeymoon.

10:02.878 --> 10:04.177
We should be on a beach,

10:04.179 --> 10:06.246
drinking mai tais out of coconut.

10:09.051 --> 10:11.213
Instead we're on this space ship,

10:11.216 --> 10:13.153
looking for our friends'
evil doppelgangers.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.821
We should have just eloped.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.923
Yeah.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.097
- Kara?
- Alex?

10:24.099 --> 10:25.899
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:25.901 --> 10:28.034
- I can't believe they almost...
- I know, I know.

10:28.036 --> 10:30.158
- I thought I lost you.
- Me too.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.274
So much for getting
away from it all, huh?

10:34.276 --> 10:36.443
I should have known better
than to think that a wedding

10:36.445 --> 10:38.566
on another Earth is gonna
solve all of our problems.

10:38.569 --> 10:40.113
Yeah, but...

10:40.115 --> 10:42.449
you know, fighting the
evil versions of ourselves

10:42.451 --> 10:45.059
does kind of put those problems
in perspective, doesn't it?

10:45.062 --> 10:46.820
Way to see the silver lining.

10:54.963 --> 10:56.718
Hey there, friend.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.669
No need to numb your
feelings with alcohol.

11:02.671 --> 11:05.785
The ghost is back.

11:05.788 --> 11:08.241
No, not a ghost. I'm Leo.

11:08.243 --> 11:10.744
Leo Snart from Earth-X.

11:10.746 --> 11:12.312
It's okay, buddy.

11:12.314 --> 11:14.280
I know you're hurting over Firestorm.

11:15.384 --> 11:17.083
Get your hand off me.

11:17.085 --> 11:19.619
What is wrong, partner? Talk to me.

11:19.621 --> 11:21.454
You're not my partner.

11:21.457 --> 11:22.957
You're a gangbanger.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.191
I think you mean "doppelganger."

11:25.193 --> 11:28.027
And there was one of
you on my earth, too.

11:28.029 --> 11:29.629
Rest his soul.

11:29.631 --> 11:32.966
Wait. I'm dead on Planet Nazi?

11:32.968 --> 11:35.502
Let me guess. In a fire?

11:35.504 --> 11:39.072
You just kept going back into
that burning police station

11:39.074 --> 11:41.841
until the last officer had been rescued.

11:41.843 --> 11:44.858
I died trying to save pigs?

11:48.111 --> 11:49.911
I'm gonna be sick.

11:50.385 --> 11:51.944
How you feeling, Jax?

11:51.947 --> 11:54.320
Oh, don't worry about me. How's Grey?

11:54.322 --> 11:57.290
I have him sedated. Don't worry.

11:57.292 --> 11:59.426
Gideon and I are doing
everything we can to fix him.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.249
Okay. Good.

12:13.508 --> 12:14.707
Still no improvement?

12:14.709 --> 12:16.142
He's getting worse.

12:16.144 --> 12:18.244
Marty or Jax?

12:18.246 --> 12:20.713
Both.

12:20.715 --> 12:22.882
I just can't believe there's
nothing Gideon can do.

12:22.884 --> 12:24.637
Medically speaking, Professor Stein

12:24.640 --> 12:26.252
shouldn't even be alive right now

12:26.254 --> 12:28.059
The only thing that
kept him from dying is...

12:28.062 --> 12:30.523
- Jax. Bonding with him.
- Yeah.

12:30.525 --> 12:31.925
Jax is basically functioning

12:31.927 --> 12:33.526
as a human life-support machine,

12:33.528 --> 12:36.129
able to keep the professor alive but...

12:36.131 --> 12:38.231
only for so long.

12:38.233 --> 12:40.667
Does Jax know?

12:40.669 --> 12:43.536
That he's gonna die too?

12:43.538 --> 12:46.940
I didn't know how to tell him.

12:46.942 --> 12:48.708
It'll be okay.

12:48.710 --> 12:50.877
We got a whole mess of
smart people on this ship.

12:50.879 --> 12:53.046
Somebody's gonna figure out something.

12:53.048 --> 12:55.515
Okay.

12:57.719 --> 13:02.255
Oh, man, I have just died
and went to geek heaven.

13:02.257 --> 13:04.123
Told you we picked the right guy.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.105
Uh, picked the right guy to do what?

13:06.108 --> 13:07.260
Hunt Nazis.

13:07.262 --> 13:11.097
Meet out resident
Earth-X expert, The Ray.

13:11.099 --> 13:14.801
Well, uh, you can use
my real name Ray Terrill.

13:14.803 --> 13:17.270
Your secret identity is your
first name with the word "the"

13:17.272 --> 13:19.105
- in front of it?
- Yeah.

13:19.107 --> 13:20.907
Why? What's your secret identity?

13:20.909 --> 13:22.075
Mr. Terrific.

13:22.077 --> 13:23.877
Really?

13:23.879 --> 13:25.979
That's a little
boast-y, don't you think?

13:25.981 --> 13:27.714
Nah, it's just one of
my favorite wrestlers.

13:27.716 --> 13:29.754
Still... that's... you
should change your name.

13:29.757 --> 13:32.105
- Can we talk about these Nazis?
- They vanished.

13:32.108 --> 13:34.888
Owing to the fact that they
have their own Waverider.

13:34.890 --> 13:36.504
A Nazi Waverider?

13:36.507 --> 13:38.124
Yeah, we had been tracking them

13:38.126 --> 13:40.126
using the radiation signature
given off by Overgirl

13:40.128 --> 13:41.871
- because of her...
- Extreme exposure

13:41.874 --> 13:42.996
to the solar radiation.

13:42.998 --> 13:44.797
Are these readings right?

13:44.799 --> 13:46.699
Yeah, of course they're right. Why?

13:46.701 --> 13:48.902
Well because the trace
radiation readings on here

13:48.904 --> 13:50.837
are slowly approaching
the Chandrasekhar Limit.

13:50.839 --> 13:53.306
- Which means?
- Overgirl isn't just dying...

13:53.308 --> 13:55.019
Yeah, if she doesn't
get Supergirl's heart,

13:55.022 --> 13:57.243
she'll create a supernova
that will destroy...

13:57.245 --> 13:58.882
the entire Midwest.

14:03.518 --> 14:05.718
Jef... Jefferson?

14:05.720 --> 14:07.554
Jefferson.

14:07.556 --> 14:11.624
I need... I need to tell you something.

14:16.565 --> 14:19.365
Well, talk fast.

14:19.367 --> 14:22.135
Because unless you're sedated,
Gideon can't do her thing,

14:22.137 --> 14:23.703
patch you back up.

14:23.705 --> 14:25.171
Can't you see that

14:25.173 --> 14:26.673
I'm dying?

14:26.675 --> 14:28.942
What... what are you talking about, man?

14:28.944 --> 14:32.178
I'm old, Jefferson.

14:32.180 --> 14:34.480
And even if I hadn't been shot,

14:34.482 --> 14:36.116
no one lives forever.

14:36.119 --> 14:37.383
Grey, I don't even want to hear you

14:37.385 --> 14:38.651
talking like that, man.

14:38.653 --> 14:42.455
As long as we're connected,

14:42.457 --> 14:44.996
I'm nothing more than an
anchor around your neck.

14:44.999 --> 14:48.294
Which is why you must help me.

14:48.296 --> 14:51.864
I don't understand. I...

14:51.866 --> 14:53.967
Not Cisco's drug.

14:53.969 --> 14:55.935
Gideon resynthesized the liquid.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.304
She assures me it will free you

14:58.306 --> 14:59.973
from my body's biology.

14:59.975 --> 15:02.375
And it will free you of mine.

15:02.377 --> 15:04.473
I'm the only thing that's
keeping you alive, man.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.680
You're asking me to kill you, Grey.

15:07.682 --> 15:09.215
I'm asking you

15:09.217 --> 15:12.318
to let me die so that you may live.

15:14.356 --> 15:16.356
Please hand me the vial.

15:16.358 --> 15:18.491
No.

15:18.493 --> 15:21.060
I know... I know you think

15:21.062 --> 15:24.230
you're strong enough for both of us.

15:24.232 --> 15:26.532
But unless I do this, we'll both die.

15:26.534 --> 15:27.934
Then we'll both die. I don't...

15:27.936 --> 15:30.336
No.

15:30.338 --> 15:33.773
You have your whole life ahead of you.

15:33.775 --> 15:35.441
Grey.

15:35.443 --> 15:37.677
But now it's time

15:37.679 --> 15:40.647
for you to let me go.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.415
No, I'm not ready for you to go.

15:42.417 --> 15:44.450
I'm not either.

15:44.452 --> 15:46.819
But when you think about it,

15:46.821 --> 15:48.955
compared to the Cosmos,

15:48.957 --> 15:51.629
one's life is but a blink of an eye.

15:51.632 --> 15:52.788
Really?

15:52.791 --> 15:56.429
You're gonna lecture me
about astrophysics right now?

15:56.431 --> 15:58.798
Grey, please don't do this to me.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.700
I can't do this.

16:00.702 --> 16:03.369
You once told me...

16:03.371 --> 16:06.939
that I was like your father and I said

16:06.941 --> 16:08.608
you were my son.

16:08.610 --> 16:12.745
How could a father do anything less?

16:14.716 --> 16:18.618
- Grey.
- Please. Please.

16:35.970 --> 16:37.866
Thank you, Jefferson.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.585
Grey, no, don't.

16:49.317 --> 16:51.017
Stay with me, please.

16:51.019 --> 16:53.453
I'd prefer not to be alone.

16:53.455 --> 16:55.755
Yeah.

16:55.757 --> 16:58.357
Please...

16:58.359 --> 17:01.512
tell Clarissa and Lily that I love them.

17:01.515 --> 17:03.896
I promise.

17:06.935 --> 17:11.436
Thank you, Jefferson...

17:11.439 --> 17:14.624
for the adventure of a lifetime.

17:17.726 --> 17:20.946
I hope your life is long

17:20.949 --> 17:22.749
and full of love.

17:22.751 --> 17:26.152
Just as mine...

17:26.154 --> 17:28.788
- has been.
- Grey.

17:28.790 --> 17:31.057
Grey.

17:31.059 --> 17:34.560
No.

17:34.562 --> 17:36.996
No, no.

18:02.953 --> 18:04.500
Jax.

18:12.149 --> 18:13.875
He did it for me.

19:11.959 --> 19:13.508
Where's Jax?

19:33.986 --> 19:36.016
I'll get it, honey.

19:40.891 --> 19:42.709
Jefferson.

19:46.081 --> 19:47.789
I'm sorry.

19:51.553 --> 19:53.188
Oh, no.

19:53.191 --> 19:56.092
No, no.

20:16.778 --> 20:18.277
How are you holding up?

20:18.279 --> 20:20.580
I'll cry at the funeral.

20:20.582 --> 20:22.749
Sara.

20:22.751 --> 20:24.183
I'm fine.

20:24.185 --> 20:25.750
We need to gather everyone.

20:25.753 --> 20:27.834
Overgirl's gonna go nuclear,
and the Earth-Xers are gonna

20:27.836 --> 20:30.423
use their Waverider to
threaten Central City

20:30.425 --> 20:32.291
and leverage us into surrendering Kara.

20:32.293 --> 20:34.060
How do you know that?

20:34.062 --> 20:35.995
It's exactly what I would do.

20:41.770 --> 20:45.938
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

20:45.940 --> 20:47.774
For being so weak.

20:47.776 --> 20:49.876
I've managed to stabilize
her deterioration,

20:49.878 --> 20:52.612
but without a transplant
she'll be dead within an hour.

20:52.614 --> 20:54.480
Quiet!

20:54.482 --> 20:57.917
Now don't you listen to her.

20:57.919 --> 21:00.453
There is more strength in you

21:00.455 --> 21:04.461
than in this entire planet
of lesser humans combined.

21:08.930 --> 21:10.463
Nice outfit.

21:10.465 --> 21:13.800
Yeah, I didn't want to feel left out.

21:13.802 --> 21:15.854
Where are we with locating
the other Waverider?

21:15.857 --> 21:16.989
We got a pretty good idea.

21:16.992 --> 21:18.137
I mean, we've all heard

21:18.139 --> 21:19.472
of the Chandrasekhar Limit, I assume?

21:19.474 --> 21:20.773
The data indicates it's still

21:20.775 --> 21:22.308
in the vicinity of Central City.

21:22.310 --> 21:23.810
Which also indicates that Overgirl

21:23.812 --> 21:25.077
isn't long for this world.

21:25.079 --> 21:26.279
Which means that this world

21:26.281 --> 21:27.446
isn't long for this world.

21:27.448 --> 21:29.015
Failure's not an option.

21:29.017 --> 21:31.651
Losing is not an
option. We are gonna win.

21:31.653 --> 21:34.153
And we are gonna show
these people that this earth

21:34.155 --> 21:36.322
- belongs to us.
- Great speech.

21:36.324 --> 21:38.257
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Queen,

21:38.259 --> 21:40.626
but we're being hailed
by a fellow Timeship.

21:40.628 --> 21:42.995
Put it on.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.469
What do you want?

21:44.472 --> 21:46.098
To offer a truce.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.633
In exchange for what?

21:47.635 --> 21:50.870
We will return to our earth peacefully

21:50.872 --> 21:53.306
if you meet my one demand.

21:53.308 --> 21:55.250
Supergirl comes with us.

21:59.047 --> 22:01.514
Here's another difference
between you and me.

22:01.516 --> 22:03.216
I don't abandon my friends.

22:06.221 --> 22:07.987
All right.

22:07.989 --> 22:10.623
- Everybody ready to go?
- Never been more.

22:10.625 --> 22:12.325
We can't bring Marty back,

22:12.327 --> 22:14.026
but we can protect the city he loved,

22:14.028 --> 22:16.896
and the family he left behind.

22:16.898 --> 22:18.631
For the Professor.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.488
Now let's go kick some ass.

22:33.796 --> 22:35.200
Let them run.

22:36.332 --> 22:38.933
We'll turn this city into a mausoleum.

23:19.482 --> 23:20.815
Kill them all.

23:20.818 --> 23:22.410
Yes, sir!

24:02.645 --> 24:03.911
Excuse me.

24:03.914 --> 24:05.047
You can't just go around

24:05.050 --> 24:06.950
- roasting people.
- Why not?

24:06.953 --> 24:08.252
You ever heard of due process?

24:08.255 --> 24:09.554
Rule of law?

24:09.557 --> 24:10.890
No.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.333
Could use a little help here.

24:29.336 --> 24:30.468
I got you covered.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.270
Whoa!

24:38.273 --> 24:40.745
This is just like Star Raiders
on Atari except it's real.

24:40.755 --> 24:41.809
Cut the chatter, Red 2.

24:41.812 --> 24:43.715
- Fly the ship.
- Launching torpedo one.

24:43.717 --> 24:45.117
You don't have to say it out loud.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.548
Okay, guys, is it just
me or is this not working?

24:53.551 --> 24:54.793
It's not working.

24:54.795 --> 24:56.594
You need to take down their shields.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.765
Open fire!

26:01.194 --> 26:02.594
Guys, this isn't working.

26:02.596 --> 26:04.364
I think we need a bigger gun.

26:04.367 --> 26:05.827
Way ahead of you.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.367
General. We've got inbound.

26:09.369 --> 26:11.569
Then fire counter-measures.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.161
We can't.

26:13.164 --> 26:15.173
It's hovering directly off our bow.

26:17.911 --> 26:20.645
General, would you care to step outside?

26:27.621 --> 26:29.187
Waiting for some good news here.

26:29.189 --> 26:30.770
I don't have any for you, man.

26:30.773 --> 26:32.274
The only way to take out
their shields is to get

26:32.276 --> 26:33.942
someone onboard that ship.

26:35.248 --> 26:37.148
We're on our way.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.421
We're on the bridge, Felicity.

27:03.423 --> 27:05.256
And we don't know
what we're looking for.

27:05.258 --> 27:07.592
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm working on it.

27:07.594 --> 27:09.153
Felicity's got it.

27:09.171 --> 27:10.338
I'm sending you the source code

27:10.340 --> 27:11.529
for their deflector shields.

27:11.531 --> 27:13.531
Yeah, got it. Manual override protocol.

27:13.533 --> 27:14.999
If I am reading this correctly,

27:15.001 --> 27:17.168
all you need to do now is...

27:17.170 --> 27:19.176
Hit the big, blinking red button.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.514
Got it. Shields are down.

27:29.516 --> 27:31.185
Harry, you think you
can handle this bad boy?

27:31.187 --> 27:33.251
- Walk in the park, Kazansky.
- Where are you going?

27:33.253 --> 27:34.953
Getting our friends off that ship.

27:34.955 --> 27:37.455
Count of ten, hit them
with everything we got.

27:37.457 --> 27:38.656
You got it.

28:22.903 --> 28:24.802
Come on, Ramon.

28:41.279 --> 28:42.723
Nailed it!

28:48.094 --> 28:50.395
Go on! End it.

28:50.397 --> 28:52.082
End it!

28:54.327 --> 28:56.694
What's stopping you?

28:56.697 --> 28:58.970
Oh, I forgot.

28:58.972 --> 29:02.043
Barry Allen is above killing.

29:02.046 --> 29:04.059
Isn't that right?

29:07.146 --> 29:08.739
Get out of here.

29:12.819 --> 29:16.854
I wonder what face I'll be
wearing next time we meet.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.156
Flash.

29:18.158 --> 29:19.996
Can't wait.

29:26.278 --> 29:28.611
I'm detecting dangerously
high radiation levels.

29:28.614 --> 29:30.401
Disembodied computer voice lady's right.

29:30.403 --> 29:32.379
Supergirl-X is about
to go super-nova.

29:32.382 --> 29:34.372
Supergirl, your doppelganger's about

29:34.374 --> 29:35.840
to have a meltdown.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.014
What do I do?

29:43.016 --> 29:44.715
You need to fly her up.

29:44.717 --> 29:46.350
Up. And away.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.543
Now.

30:05.405 --> 30:06.904
No!

30:14.281 --> 30:16.192
I'm gonna kill you.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.547
Wha... what?

30:49.549 --> 30:51.582
How did you?

30:51.584 --> 30:52.984
I figured it'd take the man

30:52.986 --> 30:55.153
of steel to catch the girl of steel.

30:55.155 --> 30:59.357
That and, you know, a
tremendous amount of help.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.376
Thank you both. This
world owes you a lot.

31:12.379 --> 31:14.089
Well, it's my world, too so...

31:14.091 --> 31:16.792
Punching out Nazis is kind of our thing.

31:16.794 --> 31:19.495
Well, if you ever need us to
do any punching over on Earth-X

31:19.497 --> 31:21.630
- just let us know.
- Will do.

31:21.632 --> 31:23.832
- Take care, Barry.
- Take care, Ray.

31:23.834 --> 31:26.401
- Barry, I need a hug.
- Okay.

31:29.173 --> 31:30.625
Be good, Leo.

31:30.628 --> 31:32.708
- Always.
- I'm gonna get ready.

31:32.710 --> 31:34.843
- You got this?
- Yeah.

31:34.845 --> 31:37.279
All right, fellas. You ready to go home?

31:37.281 --> 31:40.349
Sure. So, uh, how does this thing work?

31:40.351 --> 31:43.385
Ah, it's a very complex two-part process.

31:43.387 --> 31:46.221
One, I open a breach. Two...

31:46.223 --> 31:47.867
You walk through it.

31:48.757 --> 31:50.290
Cool.

31:52.763 --> 31:55.964
Leo?

31:55.966 --> 31:58.367
I think I'm gonna stick
around here for a little while.

31:58.369 --> 32:00.000
I, um...

32:00.805 --> 32:02.638
I won't stay here forever.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.374
I will come home to you.

32:05.376 --> 32:07.409
Promise.

32:07.411 --> 32:09.063
Okay.

32:13.864 --> 32:15.798
I love you.

32:15.809 --> 32:17.438
I love you.

32:36.240 --> 32:42.110
Uh, Clarissa asked
me to say a few words.

32:42.112 --> 32:43.836
But, as you all know,

32:43.839 --> 32:48.450
it was Grey... Martin
who was the wordy one.

32:48.452 --> 32:50.086
But...

32:50.089 --> 32:53.622
I got used to hearing
his voice inside my head.

32:53.624 --> 32:55.490
And, uh, even now

32:55.492 --> 32:57.352
I can still hear him.

32:57.355 --> 32:59.061
'Cause even though he's gone,

32:59.063 --> 33:01.663
he's still a part of me.

33:01.665 --> 33:04.299
He's still a part of all of us.

33:04.301 --> 33:06.001
He was the best man

33:06.003 --> 33:07.656
right until the end.

33:07.659 --> 33:10.060
The best teacher.

33:12.643 --> 33:15.577
Friend.

33:15.579 --> 33:17.512
Husband.

33:17.514 --> 33:19.715
Father.

33:24.822 --> 33:27.289
Clarissa...

33:27.291 --> 33:29.031
I'm so, so sorry.

33:29.034 --> 33:32.294
I-I couldn't save him. I...

33:32.296 --> 33:34.997
All he wanted was to come home.

33:34.999 --> 33:38.333
To you, and you and Ronnie.

33:38.335 --> 33:40.235
To his family.

33:40.237 --> 33:42.437
Oh, Jefferson.

33:42.439 --> 33:46.477
- You were his family, too.
- I just...

33:46.480 --> 33:48.677
I don't know how to do
any of this without him.

33:48.679 --> 33:50.779
Then, don't.

33:50.782 --> 33:53.867
You said it yourself.
He's still part of you.

33:59.490 --> 34:01.957
That's it, big guy. Let it out.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.780
Allergies.

34:03.783 --> 34:07.084
Good-bye, my love.

34:12.634 --> 34:15.063
Thank you for believing in me.

34:20.978 --> 34:22.811
Tell Ronnie I miss him.

34:27.317 --> 34:29.618
Thank you for bringing me home to her.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.893
So, you're going to another earth,

34:38.896 --> 34:40.929
and I'm going to another time.

34:40.931 --> 34:42.597
Yeah, that's kind of how we roll, huh?

34:42.599 --> 34:45.766
Totally normal.

34:45.768 --> 34:47.219
Um...

34:47.222 --> 34:49.022
Should we...

34:49.025 --> 34:50.806
It's uh... it's a hug thing, okay.

34:50.808 --> 34:52.708
Okay.

34:52.710 --> 34:56.344
Um, thank you for putting
things in perspective for me.

34:56.346 --> 34:59.715
Does that mean you're gonna
take my advice on Maggie?

34:59.717 --> 35:02.451
Yes, I'm gonna trust my instincts.

35:02.453 --> 35:05.487
I mean, there's got to be
somebody else out there for me.

35:05.489 --> 35:07.289
- Right?
- For sure.

35:07.291 --> 35:09.257
Just like there's'mebody
else out there for you.

35:09.259 --> 35:11.649
And for more than just a night.

35:11.652 --> 35:13.218
That's funny.

35:13.221 --> 35:16.030
- That was my takeaway too.
- Boss.

35:16.033 --> 35:18.533
Ship's ready.

35:18.535 --> 35:20.399
Catch you on the other side.

35:22.159 --> 35:23.925
You hit that?

35:23.928 --> 35:25.602
Shut up.

35:38.222 --> 35:39.688
You ready?

35:39.690 --> 35:42.758
Oh, so, so ready, yeah.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.693
Thank you guys for everything.

35:44.695 --> 35:47.362
And thanks for inviting
us to your wedding.

35:47.364 --> 35:50.665
Sorry it didn't turn out
the way you wanted it to.

35:50.667 --> 35:52.667
Well, at least it was memorable.

35:52.669 --> 35:54.055
Yes.

35:54.058 --> 35:55.937
Well, we'll be back out for the do-over.

35:55.939 --> 35:58.206
Uh, Iris and I talked about it and...

35:58.208 --> 36:00.075
And yeah, we're just gonna

36:00.077 --> 36:01.774
get ourselves a justice of the peace

36:01.777 --> 36:04.246
and get it done, quick and simple.

36:04.248 --> 36:06.516
Fewer Nazis that way.

36:06.519 --> 36:08.553
Well, take care, guys.

36:11.488 --> 36:13.922
- Oh.
- Oh, that's good. That's...

36:18.695 --> 36:20.462
All right.

36:23.033 --> 36:24.843
Let's go.

36:26.870 --> 36:28.770
You guys really not going
to have a wedding now

36:28.773 --> 36:30.472
- after all that?
- Now she's prowedding.

36:30.474 --> 36:31.973
- Hey.
- Well...

36:31.975 --> 36:33.708
I mean we've already had the ceremony.

36:33.710 --> 36:36.845
So all we need to do now
is exchange vows and rings.

36:36.847 --> 36:38.814
Hey, can't a mayor marry people?

36:38.816 --> 36:41.016
Very flattered, but I think
that we would have to be

36:41.018 --> 36:43.410
within the limits of Star
City for it to be official.

36:43.413 --> 36:45.787
And we definitely
want it to be official.

36:45.789 --> 36:47.355
Well, if you want it to be personal,

36:47.357 --> 36:49.734
I think we know a guy who's ordained.

36:58.518 --> 37:00.302
It's a good thing I didn't vomit, right?

37:00.304 --> 37:02.838
Yeah.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.468
Are you okay?

37:07.110 --> 37:08.777
A little warning next time?

37:08.779 --> 37:09.898
Sorry.

37:09.901 --> 37:11.851
What's up?

37:11.854 --> 37:14.115
You got ordained to marry
your brother and Carly, right?

37:14.117 --> 37:15.483
Yeah.

37:15.485 --> 37:17.085
We were hoping

37:17.088 --> 37:19.221
that you could give
us the same treatment.

37:19.223 --> 37:22.023
Wow, really? I'm honored.

37:22.025 --> 37:24.059
- Yeah?
- I am.

37:24.061 --> 37:26.695
All right, well, let's do it.

37:26.697 --> 37:28.697
Okay, that's great. Um...

37:28.699 --> 37:30.124
I guess that makes you

37:30.127 --> 37:31.832
the best man and you the maid-of-honor.

37:31.835 --> 37:33.401
- "Honored" is correct.
- All right.

37:33.403 --> 37:35.013
- Let's get into position.
- Oh my goodness.

37:35.015 --> 37:36.338
- You're here.
- Okay.

37:36.340 --> 37:38.607
- You're there, you're there.
- Oh I see.

37:38.609 --> 37:39.765
Did you guys write vows

37:39.768 --> 37:40.768
or you just want the boilerplate?

37:40.770 --> 37:43.044
Oh, uh...

37:43.046 --> 37:45.614
Yes, I um...

37:45.616 --> 37:47.048
wrote mine.

37:47.050 --> 37:49.054
Um, I tried to write mine.

37:49.057 --> 37:52.821
Um, but then I realized
that I didn't need to.

37:52.823 --> 37:54.671
Um...

37:54.674 --> 37:59.160
My entire life has been
marked by two things.

37:59.162 --> 38:00.896
The first one is change.

38:00.898 --> 38:03.598
From when I was a kid
to when I was an adult,

38:03.600 --> 38:05.367
things were always changing.

38:05.369 --> 38:08.837
But no matter how
different things became

38:08.839 --> 38:12.774
or what new challenges I had to face,

38:12.776 --> 38:17.145
I always had the other thing
that my life was marked by.

38:17.147 --> 38:19.180
And that's you.

38:19.182 --> 38:20.982
You've always been there.

38:20.984 --> 38:25.487
As a friend, as a partner,

38:25.489 --> 38:28.757
as the love of my life.

38:28.759 --> 38:31.559
You're my home, Iris.

38:31.561 --> 38:35.730
And that's one thing
that will never change.

38:38.802 --> 38:40.802
That was really nice.

38:40.804 --> 38:45.206
Um, when I was nine years old
I wanted to be a ballerina.

38:45.208 --> 38:46.675
Remember?

38:46.677 --> 38:49.144
Even though I was not
a very good dancer.

38:49.146 --> 38:53.281
And the day of the recital I froze.

38:53.283 --> 38:56.518
I couldn't move, and I wanted to die.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.887
And then I looked in the
audience and I saw you.

38:58.889 --> 39:01.623
And you got up and
you climbed onto stage

39:01.625 --> 39:04.701
and you did that whole routine with me.

39:04.704 --> 39:06.137
And we killed it.

39:06.140 --> 39:07.748
I mean...

39:07.751 --> 39:12.133
We brought the house down.

39:12.135 --> 39:15.804
And from that moment, I knew that...

39:15.806 --> 39:21.609
With you by my side,
anything was possible.

39:21.611 --> 39:27.048
The Flash may be the city's
hero, but you, Barry Allen,

39:27.050 --> 39:30.552
you're my hero.

39:30.554 --> 39:35.590
And I am happy...

39:35.592 --> 39:39.194
excited...

39:39.196 --> 39:42.430
and honored to be your wife.

39:45.369 --> 39:47.535
Wonderful.

39:47.537 --> 39:49.804
Well then I pronounce you both...

39:49.806 --> 39:52.941
Wait! Wait. Wait, just one second.

39:52.943 --> 39:55.819
Um, if you guys don't mind...
I mean if you don't mind,

39:55.822 --> 39:58.100
really if you don't mind,
but would you marry us too?

39:58.103 --> 39:59.671
Will you marry me?

39:59.674 --> 40:01.674
I thought...

40:01.677 --> 40:03.852
I mean, I thought you
didn't believe in marriage.

40:03.854 --> 40:06.087
No, but I believe in you, and...

40:06.089 --> 40:08.189
I believe that no matter
what life throws at us

40:08.191 --> 40:09.791
our love can conquer it,

40:09.793 --> 40:11.593
married, unmarried.

40:11.595 --> 40:13.061
I love you.

40:13.063 --> 40:15.630
My greatest fear...

40:15.632 --> 40:17.799
My greatest fear in life is losing you.

40:17.801 --> 40:19.300
- I...
- Yes.

40:19.302 --> 40:21.102
Okay.

40:21.104 --> 40:22.437
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

40:22.439 --> 40:24.305
I do.

40:24.397 --> 40:25.652
I do.

40:29.166 --> 40:31.746
Uh, John, what do you say?

40:31.748 --> 40:33.248
You kidding me, Oliver?

40:33.250 --> 40:34.849
I'm the guy for the past six years

40:34.851 --> 40:36.618
that's been trying to
keep you two together.

40:36.620 --> 40:39.554
It's only fitting that I marry you.

40:39.556 --> 40:42.323
Okay. Vows?

40:42.325 --> 40:44.738
- No.
- I mean, we can't do

40:44.741 --> 40:46.361
- better than them.
- Defintely not.

40:46.363 --> 40:48.430
We kind of did those fake vows
when we had that fake wedding

40:48.432 --> 40:50.398
with that psychopath
serial-killer archer lady.

40:50.400 --> 40:54.235
I remember saying something
along the lines of...

40:54.237 --> 40:58.606
You're the very best part of me.

40:58.608 --> 41:04.012
Felicity, I'm a better human being...

41:04.014 --> 41:07.082
Just because I've loved you.

41:07.084 --> 41:12.554
Well, since we don't
have any rings just yet.

41:12.556 --> 41:14.689
I'll skip right to the
part where I say this,

41:14.691 --> 41:16.691
Oliver Jonas Queen,

41:16.693 --> 41:19.194
Felicity Megan Smoak,

41:19.196 --> 41:22.363
- Bartholomew Henry Allen,
- Mmhmm.

41:22.365 --> 41:25.733
And Iris Ann West...

41:25.735 --> 41:29.070
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

41:29.072 --> 41:31.694
Please, kiss your brides.
