00:52.853 --> 00:54.855
Hey, you're kind of cute.

01:12.289 --> 01:14.291
Maybe we should take this highway.

01:14.458 --> 01:16.877
Yeah, see, if we stay on this highway...

01:23.676 --> 01:26.845
Well, look, there's a bad apple
in every barrel, right?

01:27.554 --> 01:29.390
- Got the burgers, right?
- Yeah.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.225
Paul, BB sad, sad.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.978
- Hey, BB, ready to get going there, boy?
- Oh, yes.

01:34.144 --> 01:35.562
Okay.

01:40.818 --> 01:42.903
Ready to go.

01:47.157 --> 01:49.243
What the hell was that?

02:35.372 --> 02:37.624
How are you doing there, BB?
Having fun?

02:42.629 --> 02:44.006
Look, we're lost.

02:44.173 --> 02:45.716
We passed it.

02:45.883 --> 02:48.052
Mom, we still got 12 miles left.

02:48.218 --> 02:50.471
Look, you gotta trust
your navigator, okay?

02:51.013 --> 02:54.016
How can you trust a navigator
who hasn't looked up in 10 minutes?

02:54.183 --> 02:57.019
Because I can see the odometer
right there. Hey, turn here.

03:08.739 --> 03:10.324
That was 856.

03:10.491 --> 03:11.867
The next one must be it, then.

03:12.034 --> 03:14.703
- Hey, BB we're here.
- I know.

03:14.870 --> 03:16.455
Oh, it's so pretty.

03:16.622 --> 03:18.666
God, it looks good.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.732
868 Merkle.

03:43.899 --> 03:45.359
This is it.

03:56.203 --> 04:02.376
Goddamn it. Where the hell did she put
that bottle of mine, that little bitch?

04:15.597 --> 04:17.433
Come on, guys.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.814
Come here, BB.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.075
Okay, BB.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.744
Let's go.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.330
Come on. Out of the van.

04:41.874 --> 04:44.126
Got a whole new world
for you to learn.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.503
Be careful.

04:47.004 --> 04:48.589
What do you think?

05:03.187 --> 05:05.064
Are you all right?

05:05.230 --> 05:06.440
What the hell is that?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.984
- Oh, his name is BB. Are you all right?
- BB.

05:09.526 --> 05:10.778
Yeah, sure.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.280
Is he for real?
Where did you get him?

05:13.447 --> 05:14.490
I made him.

05:14.657 --> 05:15.866
What's your name?

05:16.033 --> 05:19.161
- Tom.
- BB, this is Tom.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.832
Come on, it's okay.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.335
I can't believe this.

05:31.173 --> 05:34.218
That is incredible. Hey.

05:35.344 --> 05:36.887
What, is he programmed to do that?

05:37.054 --> 05:39.014
I developed the basic program.

05:39.181 --> 05:41.976
Then he sort of makes up his own mind
after that.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.979
Do you know anything
about artificial intelligence?

05:45.813 --> 05:47.147
This is his brain.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.608
It's not like ours, but it plans and thinks.

05:49.775 --> 05:51.652
He's always learning.

05:51.860 --> 05:53.320
He's full of surprises.

05:53.654 --> 05:57.574
I'm constantly upgrading him,
so you never know what he's gonna do.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.412
Hey, maybe I'll see you in school.
Are you in the 10th grade?

06:01.578 --> 06:03.288
Oh, not really.

06:03.455 --> 06:05.833
I'm on a scholarship at Polytech.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.336
Studying the human brain.
It's one of the best medical schools.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.754
Well.

06:10.921 --> 06:12.548
Whatever.

06:13.048 --> 06:14.633
So long, BB.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.843
Bye.

06:16.010 --> 06:17.594
Be back.

06:19.930 --> 06:21.640
So, what do you think?

06:21.849 --> 06:25.894
First thing we need to do is build a ramp
so BB can get up those stairs by himself.

06:26.061 --> 06:28.063
From Dr. Johanson.

06:30.024 --> 06:32.026
What's he up to?

06:33.068 --> 06:34.862
I need to recharge his batteries.

06:35.029 --> 06:36.864
It was a long trip.

06:37.031 --> 06:38.866
I told him to charge before we left.

06:56.508 --> 06:58.135
Hi, fellas.

06:58.385 --> 07:01.263
- Dr. Johanson. Over here.
- Paul.

07:01.430 --> 07:03.307
- Hello.
- How are you?

07:03.474 --> 07:06.393
- Welcome to Polytech.
- Thanks. Mom.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.603
- Jeannie.
- Hi, doctor.

07:07.770 --> 07:09.229
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.523
BB, come and say hello.

07:12.274 --> 07:14.610
Look at this. He's amazing.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.738
Smarter than I am,
he brought an umbrella.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.448
He keeps getting smarter too.

07:20.324 --> 07:22.618
Come on,
I've got something to show you.

07:26.163 --> 07:29.875
This is it, Paul.
Your brand new lab, all ready to go.

07:30.042 --> 07:32.336
And we've installed
a tie-in to the mainframe.

07:32.503 --> 07:35.464
So you'll have as much computer power
as you could possibly want.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.970
Chancellor Bruckner says that position
in his office is still waiting.

07:41.136 --> 07:43.597
My knuckles are raw
from knocking on wood.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.516
Well, it's out-and-out bribery.

07:45.683 --> 07:48.477
You don't think I'd let a kid like this
get away, do you?

08:27.641 --> 08:29.393
Hello there.

08:37.609 --> 08:39.861
- What's your name?
- BB. How about you?

08:40.029 --> 08:41.155
Anybody there?

08:42.740 --> 08:44.700
- Who's doing this?
- BB.

08:44.867 --> 08:46.493
BB.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.330
Hi.

08:49.747 --> 08:51.248
Hi.

08:52.124 --> 08:53.709
He's mine.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.085
No one's running him.

08:55.669 --> 08:56.712
He's doing it himself.

08:56.879 --> 08:58.005
BB.

08:58.631 --> 09:02.009
He's pretty smart.

09:02.718 --> 09:04.887
You can tell, he likes you.

09:06.096 --> 09:07.222
He's cute.

09:07.389 --> 09:11.060
My name is Sam.
Samantha, you know.

09:11.352 --> 09:12.436
What's yours?

09:13.520 --> 09:14.980
Paul.

09:15.230 --> 09:17.107
It's nice to meet you.

09:17.274 --> 09:19.401
Do you like your new house?

09:20.611 --> 09:22.363
Sort of. It's all right.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.198
Maybe I'll come over sometime.

09:24.365 --> 09:26.033
Sure.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.619
You can even come over now.

09:29.578 --> 09:31.872
No, I can't. Not right now.

09:37.461 --> 09:39.129
I'm sorry.

09:39.296 --> 09:40.798
But I really gotta go.

09:40.965 --> 09:45.594
Well, if now's not convenient for you,
how about when you're done?

09:47.096 --> 09:49.306
I'll see. Maybe later.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.898
Which direction for the first customer?

09:58.065 --> 10:00.025
- Over there.
- BB.

10:00.192 --> 10:02.403
What do you do when you're done
with your paper route?

10:02.569 --> 10:05.990
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No, the girls around here, you know...

10:06.156 --> 10:07.616
...are kind of stuck-up.

10:07.783 --> 10:09.368
It's tough.

10:09.535 --> 10:12.705
What do you know about the people
living next door to me?

10:12.871 --> 10:14.748
- Sam?
- Yeah.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.583
Great tits.

10:17.376 --> 10:19.545
You're telling me.

10:19.712 --> 10:20.963
Forget it, though.

10:21.130 --> 10:23.507
Her father will kill you
if you get within 10 feet.

10:23.674 --> 10:26.927
- Her father?
- Yeah. He's a crazy man.

10:27.636 --> 10:32.308
Speaking of crazy, welcome
to Elvira Parker's fortress.

10:34.018 --> 10:35.644
I like to think of it as a bomb.

10:39.398 --> 10:41.442
One day I'm gonna crack
this combination...

10:41.608 --> 10:44.069
...walk up and hand her the paper.

10:44.236 --> 10:46.530
Probably scare her to death,
she's so paranoid.

10:46.697 --> 10:48.949
BB could crack that lock in a minute.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.576
You're kidding.

10:50.743 --> 10:54.079
Why would I be kidding? BB's smart.

10:54.246 --> 10:56.623
Who's out there?
What are you doing?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.500
Oh, it's just me, Mrs. Parker.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.127
- What is that?
- BB.

11:00.294 --> 11:02.129
You get that thing away from my gate.

11:04.673 --> 11:06.342
I'm warning you.

11:08.302 --> 11:09.511
Jesus.

11:09.678 --> 11:12.014
She's waved that at me
a million times.

11:12.181 --> 11:14.808
It's just a robot, Mrs. Parker.
He's your new neighbor.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.645
You get that out of here
or I'll blow your heads off.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.813
Okay, we're going. We're going.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.732
Remember
I have to collect tomorrow.

11:21.899 --> 11:23.317
That must be fun.

11:23.484 --> 11:25.027
A blast.

11:27.780 --> 11:29.365
What does your dad do?

11:29.531 --> 11:32.993
He's a security guard over
at the university hospital.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.120
It's not bad.
He's got keys to everything.

11:35.287 --> 11:37.081
The university gym, weight room.

11:37.247 --> 11:40.376
Sometimes we use the pool late at night.

11:40.542 --> 11:43.045
Do you like diving?
We got a great team on the board.

11:43.212 --> 11:45.339
That sounds fun.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.469
- Yo, lick.
- Shit.

11:50.636 --> 11:52.763
Here comes Carl and his goon squad.

11:55.349 --> 11:57.017
Stop here.

12:01.981 --> 12:03.273
What the hell is this?

12:03.440 --> 12:05.067
Hey, come here.

12:05.234 --> 12:08.529
- Look at this thing.
- Don't do that.

12:09.363 --> 12:11.407
Who's gonna stop me?

12:13.367 --> 12:15.911
Hey, does anybody got a can opener?

12:16.870 --> 12:17.913
- Hey.
- All right.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.416
- Don't.
- Get out of my face.

12:22.710 --> 12:25.671
Hey, be careful. He'll hurt you.

12:26.547 --> 12:28.048
Who? This garbage can?

12:33.554 --> 12:34.805
Careful.

12:36.181 --> 12:37.725
He can crush you if he wants.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.560
He has three multivalve compressors.

12:42.855 --> 12:45.274
- Tell your friends to leave.
- Yeah.

12:49.445 --> 12:51.822
- Leave. Leave.
- Leave.

12:51.989 --> 12:53.824
Get away.

12:55.117 --> 12:56.410
Get on your bikes now.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.747
Get on your bikes. Now.

13:06.629 --> 13:08.756
Okay. Okay, let go, man.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.966
Okay, BB, let go.

13:27.566 --> 13:29.485
I'll get you.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.659
BB did good.

13:43.415 --> 13:45.793
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.836
I thought I'd come by.

13:48.003 --> 13:50.381
If you're busy or still eating,
I can come back.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.174
We're done.

13:52.758 --> 13:54.385
Come on in.

13:55.177 --> 13:57.471
I wanted to bake you something...

13:57.638 --> 13:59.556
...but I couldn't.

13:59.807 --> 14:01.892
I just brought these.

14:05.187 --> 14:07.022
Oh, I love these.

14:07.189 --> 14:08.732
I love them.

14:08.899 --> 14:10.442
Thank you. Come on in.

14:10.609 --> 14:12.152
- Come on in.
- Paul, who is it?

14:12.319 --> 14:13.904
It's just Sam from next door.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.533
Everything is pretty much a mess still.

14:28.711 --> 14:31.088
This is like the science lab at school.

14:31.255 --> 14:33.924
You're the first girl
I ever had in my room.

14:34.842 --> 14:37.219
I bet you tell all the girls that.

14:40.472 --> 14:42.016
Wow, what's up here?

14:42.683 --> 14:44.518
Oh, it's just the attic.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.698
- Hello?
- Hello.

14:57.865 --> 14:59.408
I'm looking for my daughter.

14:59.575 --> 15:01.118
I'm from next door.

15:01.285 --> 15:03.120
Did she come here?

15:03.287 --> 15:04.872
Oh, no.

15:06.957 --> 15:08.000
It's all right.

15:08.167 --> 15:10.919
We were studying.
We were just studying.

15:13.088 --> 15:15.132
You didn't say anything about going out.

15:15.299 --> 15:17.551
You were sleeping.
I didn't think you'd mind.

15:18.927 --> 15:21.889
Why don't you tell these people
you're sorry for bothering them?

15:22.056 --> 15:23.724
- Oh, but she wasn't...
- I'm sorry.

15:23.891 --> 15:26.226
Hey, this won't happen again.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.937
- Dad, I told you I was studying.
- Just studying, huh?

15:29.104 --> 15:31.231
- Don't, that hurts.
- Too bad.

16:12.314 --> 16:16.610
You probably told them
all sorts of lies, didn't you?

16:16.777 --> 16:20.614
About me. Just like your mother.

16:20.781 --> 16:23.617
I didn't even talk about you, Daddy.

16:23.784 --> 16:26.495
I just saw the house, met his mother.

16:26.662 --> 16:28.372
Just met his mother?

16:28.539 --> 16:31.291
What? You been fooling around
with him?

16:31.458 --> 16:35.796
Your mother would be proud.
Just like her.

16:37.715 --> 16:39.800
I don't want you here.

16:39.967 --> 16:41.343
Don't touch me.

16:41.510 --> 16:44.305
I'll touch you anytime I like.

16:44.471 --> 16:47.224
You little bitch. I'm your father.

16:47.391 --> 16:50.311
- You do what I tell you.
- Oh, Dad, stop it!

16:59.153 --> 17:04.157
You can't hurt me
because Daddy don't wanna be hurt.

17:05.534 --> 17:07.202
You can't stop me.

17:07.368 --> 17:09.204
He can't stop me.

17:09.371 --> 17:13.500
And that little stupid yellow robot
can't stop me.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.669
No, stop it.

17:15.836 --> 17:18.672
Daddy, stop it.

17:50.162 --> 17:52.873
Now, this is the cross-coupled
sentry-control hierarchy...

17:53.040 --> 17:55.501
...that worked best for BB's early brain.

17:55.668 --> 17:58.420
Links from right to left provide
context and expectations...

17:58.587 --> 18:00.381
...processing sensory data.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.675
You can see the type
of feedback information...

18:02.841 --> 18:05.886
...provided to the task-seek
composition hierarchy at each level.

18:06.053 --> 18:07.930
Of course,
we're a lot further along now.

18:08.097 --> 18:11.600
We're pretty close to approaching
the way a normal human brain works.

18:25.406 --> 18:27.241
I got it.

18:29.159 --> 18:30.953
Bring it over here.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.205
BB should take a shot, huh?

18:33.372 --> 18:35.791
- Want to? Want to take a shot, BB?
- BB, ball.

18:35.958 --> 18:37.543
- All right.
- Good.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.172
Let's go. Let's see it.

18:55.102 --> 18:57.021
- Oh, boy.
- We gotta get it.

18:57.187 --> 18:58.814
Oh, boy.

19:00.274 --> 19:01.650
Okay, let's go.

19:08.073 --> 19:09.742
Oh, I don't know.

19:09.908 --> 19:12.619
- I can do it.
- No.

19:14.455 --> 19:15.497
I'll get it.

19:26.467 --> 19:29.470
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Nothing.

19:35.643 --> 19:37.478
Hey, you can't do that.

19:37.645 --> 19:39.271
Oh, yes I can.

19:39.438 --> 19:42.316
My property. My house.

19:42.483 --> 19:44.401
My ball.

19:46.987 --> 19:48.989
What a witch!

19:49.448 --> 19:51.950
Really the pits.

20:00.793 --> 20:03.504
Come on, BB.
There's nothing we can do.

20:07.132 --> 20:08.676
BB.

20:20.020 --> 20:21.438
Let's go.

20:26.986 --> 20:30.781
Paul, as soon as you finish that, I want
you to trace the cortical motor pathway.

20:31.740 --> 20:33.701
I already did that.

20:36.453 --> 20:37.579
You already did it?

20:42.751 --> 20:48.132
It runs from the cortex to the substantia
nigra to the medulla oblongata.

20:48.882 --> 20:50.384
Look at this.

20:54.013 --> 20:55.431
What the hell?

20:56.223 --> 20:57.433
How did you do that?

20:58.434 --> 21:01.729
I hooked it up to a new circuit
I set up for BB.

21:01.895 --> 21:05.399
And all of a sudden
it started showing animation.

21:13.574 --> 21:16.910
Dr. Johanson tells me things
are really coming along on your project.

21:17.077 --> 21:18.203
It's true.

21:18.370 --> 21:20.581
He's making very nice progress.

21:22.916 --> 21:25.544
- Want me to get that?
- No, I'll get it.

21:31.342 --> 21:32.801
Do you have some ice?

21:32.968 --> 21:34.887
Oh, my God.

21:36.263 --> 21:37.931
Come on in.

21:40.517 --> 21:42.102
Sit down.

21:42.269 --> 21:43.979
Paul, get some ice.

21:44.146 --> 21:46.398
Hold your head back, back.

21:46.565 --> 21:48.150
Hurry.

21:48.359 --> 21:51.695
- What happened?
- Nothing. I just get them sometime.

21:51.945 --> 21:53.447
Here you go.

21:54.948 --> 21:58.285
Listen, sweetheart, this may be
butting in where I don't belong...

21:58.452 --> 22:00.871
...but don't you think
someone should say something?

22:01.038 --> 22:04.416
For what, a nosebleed? Come on,
I've had them since I was a kid.

22:04.583 --> 22:07.419
Ice will take care of it.
I just forgot to fill the tray.

22:07.586 --> 22:10.589
- Oh, Sam, I don't like this.
- I hate them.

22:11.340 --> 22:13.550
Come on, you know what I mean.

22:13.717 --> 22:15.594
It's criminal.

22:15.970 --> 22:17.304
He could go to jail.

22:19.306 --> 22:21.225
He's my father.

22:22.685 --> 22:26.730
Sometimes I wanna roll a truck
over his face, but he's still my father.

22:48.002 --> 22:49.837
Hey, you little creeps, cut that out.

22:50.004 --> 22:53.007
Hey, come on. Let's get out of here.

22:55.342 --> 22:58.429
Come on, I got a great idea
for the next place.

22:59.388 --> 23:00.597
We can't go in there.

23:00.764 --> 23:02.599
Who's stopping us?

23:02.850 --> 23:04.435
Hey, BB.

23:04.601 --> 23:06.186
BB, come here.

23:06.353 --> 23:07.938
BB, come on. Come on, boy.

23:08.105 --> 23:10.149
- Come here.
- No, he can't open that.

23:10.316 --> 23:14.028
- What do you mean? You said he could.
- Yeah, he can, but he's not going to.

23:14.194 --> 23:15.529
Oh, come on, Paul.

23:16.280 --> 23:19.074
I mean, imagine her face
when she hears the doorbell.

23:19.241 --> 23:21.869
There hasn't been a kid closer
to this fence in years.

23:22.036 --> 23:23.454
No.

23:24.038 --> 23:26.248
She wouldn't even know who it is.

23:26.415 --> 23:27.916
It's Halloween.

23:28.083 --> 23:29.668
Trick or treat.

23:30.085 --> 23:31.545
Yeah.

23:33.672 --> 23:35.215
Go ahead.

23:48.145 --> 23:49.188
What's he doing?

23:49.355 --> 23:53.192
He's trying every possible three number
combination between one and 40.

23:53.359 --> 23:54.735
There's about 64,000.

24:01.241 --> 24:02.951
Look, this could take all night.

24:03.577 --> 24:06.246
I really don't think
we should be doing this.

24:12.753 --> 24:15.756
BB, wait. Get back here.

24:15.923 --> 24:17.174
BB, get over here.

24:17.341 --> 24:18.509
Right now.

24:18.676 --> 24:19.718
Paul.

24:19.885 --> 24:22.846
No. He's been acting way too strange.

24:23.389 --> 24:25.766
Well, then who's gonna do it?
Any volunteers?

24:25.933 --> 24:27.142
I'll go.

24:27.309 --> 24:30.771
Sam, wait. Hold on just a second. Sam.

24:54.712 --> 24:56.005
- Sam, get out!
- Come on.

24:56.171 --> 24:57.923
Oh, God!

25:01.969 --> 25:03.053
Are you okay?

25:03.220 --> 25:05.639
Let's go. She's coming. Run.

25:10.811 --> 25:11.854
Who's there?

25:12.313 --> 25:14.148
Who's out there?

25:21.488 --> 25:22.990
BB, no. Get back.

25:23.657 --> 25:24.825
Get out of here.

25:26.493 --> 25:28.996
Why the hell isn't he responding?

25:30.289 --> 25:31.332
Get out of here.

25:31.498 --> 25:33.334
Get back.

25:35.044 --> 25:38.505
No! No, BB!

25:45.471 --> 25:47.181
Oh, God!

26:15.918 --> 26:19.672
With the diagnosis and localization
of chronic subdural hematoma...

26:19.838 --> 26:23.884
...either by ventriculography
or by subdural puncture, let me say this.

26:24.134 --> 26:28.013
It may be unnecessary
to complete the air injection...

26:39.900 --> 26:42.736
Thank you, Lord,
for all the blessings in our life.

26:43.404 --> 26:48.325
This wonderful, cozy old house
and for a car that still runs.

26:48.492 --> 26:52.871
And for the generosity of the university
and especially Dr. Johanson.

26:53.455 --> 26:54.707
Please bless us, Lord.

26:54.873 --> 26:56.750
And bless Sam.

26:57.126 --> 27:00.963
And may you keep her father dead to the
world for the rest of the night. Amen.

27:01.130 --> 27:03.257
- Amen.
- Amen.

27:03.424 --> 27:05.843
Okay, let's do it. Pass the food.
Let's eat.

27:12.182 --> 27:14.101
Looks up on the left and Ferris slips it.

27:14.268 --> 27:16.103
Ferris tries a left hand
to the body...

27:16.395 --> 27:20.149
- Good night, Jeannie. Thanks a lot.
- Good night, Sam.

27:54.767 --> 27:56.435
Good night.

27:56.602 --> 27:58.145
Good night.

29:05.546 --> 29:07.256
Daddy?

29:22.271 --> 29:23.897
Daddy?

29:26.066 --> 29:28.068
Are you in my room?

29:29.486 --> 29:30.988
Where have you been?

29:32.448 --> 29:34.575
I was studying, Daddy.
I had homework.

29:34.742 --> 29:36.952
You lying little bitch!

29:48.088 --> 29:49.590
Okay, come on now.

29:49.757 --> 29:51.800
None of this shit.

29:52.718 --> 29:53.969
You get the hell up.

29:55.763 --> 29:57.473
Samantha.

29:57.640 --> 30:01.101
I'm not joking. You wanna know
what real trouble is?

30:03.062 --> 30:04.730
I mean it.

30:06.398 --> 30:08.859
You get the hell up and get in your room.

30:18.494 --> 30:20.371
Watch that step.

30:22.289 --> 30:24.458
- Easy, now.
- Sam?

30:24.625 --> 30:26.335
What's happened to her?

30:29.380 --> 30:33.342
Goddamn kid. I told her
to clean up her stuff off the stairs.

30:33.509 --> 30:35.636
- She never would've tripped.
- Oh, my God.

30:35.803 --> 30:37.805
- Ready?
- Ready.

30:41.850 --> 30:42.935
Come on. Get in the car.

30:46.021 --> 30:47.815
Show any signs of stabilizing yet?

30:47.982 --> 30:50.567
No, look. If anything, it's gotten worse.

30:50.734 --> 30:53.278
If we can't stop the hemorrhaging
we're gonna lose her.

30:53.445 --> 30:55.823
- Dr. Greenberg's on his way.
- Fine.

31:01.537 --> 31:03.706
- Microforceps.
- Microforceps.

31:04.999 --> 31:07.626
- Cottonoid.
- Cottonoid.

31:11.922 --> 31:13.924
That was some fall.

31:14.091 --> 31:16.093
Looks like more than a fall to me.

31:16.260 --> 31:18.595
What's the reading on the EEG?

31:19.555 --> 31:22.224
- Flatline.
- There sure ain't nothing on the brain.

31:22.850 --> 31:24.518
No vitals.

31:26.603 --> 31:28.355
Close her up.

31:30.065 --> 31:32.443
God, she's such a pretty kid.

31:33.068 --> 31:34.194
Suture.

31:35.029 --> 31:36.739
Is she alive?

31:38.824 --> 31:41.035
We have her on life support.

31:41.201 --> 31:45.247
We'll maintain her for the next 24 hours
for further readings...

31:45.998 --> 31:48.292
...but I'm afraid that's just a formality.

31:50.169 --> 31:52.046
Her brain is dead, Paul.

31:53.005 --> 31:55.215
I'm sorry.
There was nothing we could do.

31:55.382 --> 31:57.718
What do you mean, there's nothing
you could do?

31:58.218 --> 32:02.014
We have experimental things, a whole
battery of things. You can't let her die.

32:02.181 --> 32:05.476
Paul, there was nothing we
or anybody else could do.

32:07.603 --> 32:09.063
Paul.

32:09.647 --> 32:11.273
Paul.

32:53.315 --> 32:54.775
Tom.

32:57.236 --> 32:59.571
Tom. Hey, wake up.

32:59.738 --> 33:01.115
Paul.

33:01.740 --> 33:03.283
What are you doing here?

33:03.450 --> 33:05.119
I need a favor.

33:05.285 --> 33:06.412
A big one.

33:06.578 --> 33:08.080
What's up?

33:09.290 --> 33:11.875
I need you to stay at my house tonight.

33:12.334 --> 33:16.463
Your house? What are you talking about?
Do you know what time it is?

33:17.006 --> 33:19.466
And I need your dad's keys,
just for the night.

33:22.970 --> 33:24.263
Are you kidding?

33:24.430 --> 33:27.016
- Do you know what he'd do to me?
- He won't find out.

33:28.434 --> 33:30.060
What's this all about?

33:31.061 --> 33:32.646
We're gonna save Sam.

33:35.107 --> 33:36.650
Sam?

33:36.817 --> 33:39.236
What do you mean, save Sam?
She's dead.

33:39.403 --> 33:40.821
No, she isn't. Not yet.

33:41.322 --> 33:45.743
We're gonna go to the hospital and get
her out before they pull the plug at 10.

33:46.493 --> 33:48.746
- No, we're not.
- Hey, you owe me, Tom.

33:48.912 --> 33:51.624
- No way.
- You owe me.

33:51.790 --> 33:53.500
It's because of you BB got killed.

33:53.917 --> 33:55.502
You said so yourself.

33:58.339 --> 33:59.757
Paul.

34:03.344 --> 34:05.262
Save Sam?

34:06.847 --> 34:08.849
How do you figure on doing that?

34:14.103 --> 34:16.690
Are you out of your fucking mind?

34:26.116 --> 34:27.451
Are you two through?

34:27.618 --> 34:30.204
- Yeah.
- It was great.

34:30.704 --> 34:32.581
Now, how about some pie?

34:32.748 --> 34:33.873
Oh, no.

34:34.041 --> 34:35.583
And some coffee for me.

34:37.002 --> 34:38.754
Pie and coffee. Yes, sir.

34:39.088 --> 34:40.589
Boy, that sounds good.

34:55.728 --> 34:57.398
Whipped cream?

34:58.065 --> 34:59.316
Yes.

35:30.014 --> 35:31.473
Thanks.

35:50.159 --> 35:52.286
Boy, I make good coffee.

35:53.954 --> 35:54.997
Are you okay?

35:57.333 --> 35:59.668
Yeah, just something in my throat.

36:11.013 --> 36:12.806
You look tired.

36:13.057 --> 36:14.642
Maybe you should just go to bed.

36:14.808 --> 36:16.143
No.

36:16.977 --> 36:18.562
I'm wide awake.

36:23.984 --> 36:26.320
I keep thinking about the hospital.

36:26.904 --> 36:28.947
Thinking we should be there.

36:30.532 --> 36:31.950
What could we do?

36:32.117 --> 36:33.160
Just sit.

36:33.327 --> 36:35.746
Well, I know.

36:37.706 --> 36:40.167
But it just feels so strange.

36:41.085 --> 36:43.003
- Nine o'clock will come and...
- Nine?

36:43.879 --> 36:45.381
You mean 10.

36:45.547 --> 36:47.925
No, nine.

36:48.550 --> 36:50.678
They changed it to nine.

36:52.721 --> 36:54.848
Something to do with the coroner.

36:55.849 --> 36:57.393
Less than an hour.

37:00.938 --> 37:03.065
Boy, I need some more coffee.

37:18.664 --> 37:22.543
- Hey. Hey, is she gonna be okay?
- Just shut up and get in the van.

37:24.378 --> 37:25.963
We're never gonna make it in time.

37:26.130 --> 37:28.716
Will you quit saying that?
We're gonna make it.

37:28.882 --> 37:31.051
- You got the windshield wipers on.
- I know.

37:31.218 --> 37:33.929
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.
I'm trying to put on my seatbelt.

37:34.096 --> 37:36.640
- Where's first?
- Up and left.

37:48.277 --> 37:51.196
- What was that?
- Jesus, take it easy.

37:57.077 --> 37:58.954
Boy, what a ride.

37:59.455 --> 38:01.624
Hey, where did you learn
how to drive, huh?

38:01.790 --> 38:04.501
- Between the house and here.
- What?

38:05.127 --> 38:08.339
Lts BB's battery for the respirator.
Hang on to it.

38:09.381 --> 38:10.424
You got the keys?

38:10.591 --> 38:12.426
Yeah, I got them.

38:15.387 --> 38:20.434
Mother drugging, car theft, reckless
driving without a license, illegal trespass.

38:20.601 --> 38:23.771
- We'll be old when we get out.
- Will you shut up and open the door?

38:29.318 --> 38:30.944
Over here.

38:33.947 --> 38:38.202
- How did you know this would be here?
- I put it here earlier. Let's go.

38:39.787 --> 38:41.121
Here are the directions.

38:41.288 --> 38:44.959
At 8:59, you're gonna throw the
switches. Don't worry, I checked it out.

38:45.125 --> 38:47.419
There are backup generators.
Nobody will get hurt.

38:47.586 --> 38:49.296
I just need a diversion, all right?

38:49.463 --> 38:50.965
Then what?

38:51.131 --> 38:52.549
I don't know.

38:52.716 --> 38:54.259
What do you mean, you don't know?

38:54.426 --> 38:57.638
Look, we're an hour late.
I'm doing the best I can, all right?

38:58.347 --> 39:00.432
Okay, it's 8:55.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.518
Give me four... Are you listening?

39:02.685 --> 39:05.729
Give me four minutes,
then throw this switch, okay?

39:06.021 --> 39:09.942
Tom, just do as I tell you.
It'll be a piece of cake, okay?

39:12.653 --> 39:14.738
Why don't I believe you?

39:37.344 --> 39:41.181
So, what can I do? She said
she wanted the house and the car.

39:48.314 --> 39:51.191
Come on. Come on.

39:54.528 --> 39:56.530
It's not 9:00 yet.

39:57.448 --> 39:59.199
We should just do it.

40:04.580 --> 40:06.415
What a waste.

40:31.315 --> 40:34.568
- Okay, let's gather up the equipment.
- Let's go.

40:51.502 --> 40:53.045
Easy, Tom.

40:53.796 --> 40:54.838
Don't blow it.

40:57.549 --> 41:01.887
There's a message.
Check the pressure on number five.

41:05.933 --> 41:09.520
Shit. Shit. Shit, Tom.

41:19.947 --> 41:21.240
Your attention, please.

41:21.407 --> 41:24.952
We have experienced a temporary
interruption in electrical power.

41:25.119 --> 41:28.455
Central services are now being handled
by our backup system...

41:28.622 --> 41:30.958
...while maintenance
is working to restore power.

41:31.125 --> 41:35.796
The staff will limit its use
of all nonessential electrical services.

41:57.651 --> 41:59.445
You really got her.

41:59.611 --> 42:00.654
Where's all her stuff?

42:00.821 --> 42:02.865
- Where's her life support?
- We were too late.

42:03.032 --> 42:05.909
Too late? What do you mean too late?
What's she doing here?

42:06.076 --> 42:08.746
- They pulled the plug.
- She's dead?

42:08.912 --> 42:10.914
Hey, she's dead?

42:11.999 --> 42:15.711
Hey. What the hell are you doing? You
didn't say anything about a dead body.

42:15.878 --> 42:18.005
- We're supposed to save her.
- We're gonna try.

42:18.172 --> 42:21.008
Try? Are you crazy or something?
Are you crazy?

42:21.175 --> 42:22.426
What's the matter with you?

42:22.593 --> 42:24.928
What did you want me to do,
leave her there?

42:25.262 --> 42:27.181
Goddamn it.

42:27.556 --> 42:30.017
There's still a chance.
Things we can do.

42:30.184 --> 42:32.686
We've gotta go now. Sit down.

42:32.853 --> 42:35.898
I want out. I mean it,
I'm gonna throw up.

42:36.065 --> 42:37.358
Throw up later.

42:41.362 --> 42:44.031
Hey, slow down.

42:46.867 --> 42:48.661
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

42:49.078 --> 42:50.746
How do you think I built BB?

42:50.913 --> 42:54.959
I studied brain physiology and cognitive
theory till it's coming out of my ears.

42:55.125 --> 42:56.835
I have ideas no one ever thought of.

42:57.002 --> 42:58.253
I'll buy that.

43:00.130 --> 43:01.382
This is it.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.425
Wanna see?

43:19.149 --> 43:20.776
Perfect.

43:22.069 --> 43:23.112
What is that?

43:23.278 --> 43:26.281
It's BB's brain. Or it was BB's brain.

43:26.907 --> 43:28.242
I've doctored it up a bit.

43:28.701 --> 43:30.244
You're giving her a robot brain?

43:30.911 --> 43:32.663
I'm giving her a computer.

43:32.830 --> 43:35.749
It's a battery powered,
self-contained computer.

43:36.750 --> 43:39.169
You know what a pacemaker
is for the heart, right?

43:39.336 --> 43:41.505
Well, this is like that
only it's for the head.

43:41.672 --> 43:45.759
If there's any life left at all in her brain,
this will find it.

43:45.926 --> 43:48.095
We'll reroute it around
the damaged portion...

43:48.262 --> 43:50.597
...and join it all together
as a whole again.

43:54.977 --> 43:56.020
Now what?

44:00.983 --> 44:03.152
Now we see if it works.

44:05.404 --> 44:07.114
You're kidding.

44:10.409 --> 44:12.036
You're kidding, right?

44:12.202 --> 44:13.621
Are you ready?

44:13.787 --> 44:14.955
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

44:29.011 --> 44:34.141
Paul. Paul. There's no heartbeat.
She's ice cold.

44:34.558 --> 44:36.143
Did you see that?

44:36.644 --> 44:37.686
See what?

44:37.853 --> 44:39.104
Her toe. It moved.

44:39.271 --> 44:41.273
- It's just your mind.
- No. It moved.

44:41.440 --> 44:46.362
No, look, Paul. I was standing
right there. Nothing is happening.

44:47.821 --> 44:49.073
Sam.

44:52.743 --> 44:54.119
Tom.

44:54.286 --> 44:56.038
Hey, you okay?

45:00.042 --> 45:01.752
What was that?

45:03.671 --> 45:05.339
I don't know.

45:22.231 --> 45:24.566
- I'll go ahead first.
- All right.

45:29.154 --> 45:30.531
Okay.

45:32.074 --> 45:34.159
- Gentle, gentle.
- I know. I know.

45:34.326 --> 45:35.828
Okay.

45:46.463 --> 45:47.631
- Go the other way.
- What?

45:47.798 --> 45:49.174
Other way.

45:57.474 --> 45:59.476
I'll see you in the house.

46:36.347 --> 46:37.931
You don't wanna go in there.

46:38.098 --> 46:40.934
- What do you mean?
- I think you killed her.

46:41.226 --> 46:44.980
- What are you talking about?
- I had a feeling you put too much in.

46:54.406 --> 46:56.158
It was all measured.

46:57.242 --> 46:58.702
Mom?

47:00.079 --> 47:01.956
Oh, God.

47:02.122 --> 47:03.916
Mom?

47:04.500 --> 47:06.043
Mom.

47:06.710 --> 47:09.838
- Oh, God. Mom.
- What? What?

47:12.967 --> 47:14.885
What time is it?

47:15.886 --> 47:18.138
It's about 7:30.

47:18.472 --> 47:20.349
Did I sleep here all night?

47:22.434 --> 47:24.353
Yeah, I think you did.

47:26.814 --> 47:28.565
I never do that.

47:29.733 --> 47:31.860
I can't believe I did that.

47:39.868 --> 47:41.578
What have you two been up to?

47:44.498 --> 47:46.208
Nothing much.

47:46.834 --> 47:48.669
We've just been fooling around.

47:49.003 --> 47:51.338
Yeah, yeah. Just fooling around.

47:54.925 --> 47:57.303
I gotta go wash my face.

48:10.316 --> 48:12.609
I really don't know what to say.

48:13.277 --> 48:16.071
I really appreciate everything
you've done.

48:16.322 --> 48:18.574
You really made it up to me.

48:18.907 --> 48:20.701
You're a true friend.

48:21.744 --> 48:23.287
We're even now, right?

48:23.454 --> 48:25.831
Oh, of course.

48:26.498 --> 48:28.000
Okay.

48:31.003 --> 48:32.713
Hey, remember...

48:32.880 --> 48:36.216
...it's just between you and me, right?
All right.

48:36.717 --> 48:38.594
See you around, okay?

49:11.168 --> 49:12.878
You're breathing.

49:20.302 --> 49:22.054
It's okay.

49:22.221 --> 49:24.598
Okay, we got time. This one's it.

49:24.765 --> 49:26.767
You got it this time.

49:27.059 --> 49:28.394
All right?

49:28.560 --> 49:31.188
Feel that? Feel that?

49:31.605 --> 49:33.273
Just hold it.

49:35.150 --> 49:37.444
One more time and you got it.

49:38.362 --> 49:39.989
There you are.

49:40.447 --> 49:42.157
Just hold it.

49:42.449 --> 49:43.784
Comfortable?

49:43.951 --> 49:46.704
Okay, I'm letting go.

49:48.330 --> 49:50.165
Okay.

49:50.332 --> 49:52.293
That's wonderful.

49:52.459 --> 49:54.378
That's wonderful.

50:10.477 --> 50:13.981
- Has anybody talked to her father?
- Relax. Just got here ourselves. Wait.

50:14.148 --> 50:16.150
What's the official word?
Did she walk away?

50:16.317 --> 50:17.860
Can I get a picture?

51:33.143 --> 51:34.895
Sam.

51:37.272 --> 51:40.025
How in the hell did you get up?

51:42.236 --> 51:44.196
How did you stand?

51:51.912 --> 51:53.580
What's going on?

52:26.196 --> 52:28.490
Sit down.

52:43.130 --> 52:44.298
Paul.

52:44.465 --> 52:48.218
Paul Conway,
you get out here this instant.

52:59.063 --> 53:00.773
What the hell's this all about?

53:00.939 --> 53:03.400
What's going on around here, huh?

53:03.567 --> 53:05.945
What is this doing out here?

53:06.820 --> 53:09.073
I buy you a $200 down sleeping bag...

53:09.239 --> 53:11.909
...and I find it trashed in the middle
of the backyard.

53:12.076 --> 53:13.827
What's going on, huh?

53:13.994 --> 53:15.871
I had to try it out.

53:16.497 --> 53:19.792
Look, when IBM is paying you
a hundred thou a year...

53:19.959 --> 53:22.419
...you can buy as many sleeping bags
as you want.

53:22.586 --> 53:26.215
But as long as I'm supporting us,
you show some respect. Understand?

53:26.590 --> 53:27.841
Okay.

55:06.649 --> 55:08.192
Who is it?

55:08.484 --> 55:09.860
Who's there?

55:53.404 --> 55:55.155
Sam?

55:56.323 --> 55:59.034
You're supposed to be dead.

56:01.203 --> 56:03.080
My God.

56:25.185 --> 56:26.729
Get away from me.

56:42.995 --> 56:44.496
Sam.

56:49.209 --> 56:51.086
Sam, it was an accident.

56:51.253 --> 56:52.588
I didn't mean to do it.

58:13.002 --> 58:14.628
Mr. Pringle?

58:44.283 --> 58:46.201
Oh, God.

01:00:14.373 --> 01:00:16.125
I gotta leave you here for now, Sam.

01:00:19.169 --> 01:00:21.005
I can't put you back in the tool shed.

01:00:21.797 --> 01:00:23.716
I can't trust you.

01:00:26.593 --> 01:00:29.430
I'll be back for you later, okay?

01:00:31.348 --> 01:00:33.267
I just need time to think.

01:00:40.024 --> 01:00:42.693
I just need to figure it out.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.362
Oh, I've got the prettiest mother.

01:00:45.529 --> 01:00:47.948
I've got the nicest mother.

01:00:48.115 --> 01:00:49.908
That's what I tell everybody.

01:00:50.075 --> 01:00:53.412
I say I've got the sweetest mother
in the world.

01:00:53.579 --> 01:00:55.372
If she wants a little boy that bad...

01:00:55.539 --> 01:00:57.958
...why doesn 't she take one
out of the orphan 's home?

01:00:58.125 --> 01:01:00.836
Rhoda, get away from me.
Don 't talk to me.

01:01:01.003 --> 01:01:03.464
- We have nothing to say to each other.
- Okay, Mother.

01:01:03.631 --> 01:01:05.341
Okay.

01:01:08.302 --> 01:01:09.803
Rhoda.

01:01:10.471 --> 01:01:12.056
When we lived in Wichita, Rhoda...

01:01:12.222 --> 01:01:15.559
...there was an old lady who lived
upstairs, Mrs. Carson. She liked you.

01:01:15.726 --> 01:01:17.895
- Yes.
- Every afternoon you'd go upstairs...

01:01:18.062 --> 01:01:20.856
...and visit her and she used to
show you all her treasures.

01:01:21.023 --> 01:01:25.402
And the one that you admired most
was a crystal ball and candlestick holder.

01:01:26.487 --> 01:01:28.072
Operator, quick.

01:01:28.238 --> 01:01:29.823
Get me the police.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.413
- Yeah?
- Sarge, its Elvira Parker.

01:01:37.247 --> 01:01:38.582
Again?

01:01:38.749 --> 01:01:41.335
- What is it with that woman?
- She said it's urgent.

01:01:41.502 --> 01:01:45.714
And she said she's seen the dead girl
walk around the house across the street.

01:01:46.006 --> 01:01:47.424
God, that woman is crazy.

01:01:49.176 --> 01:01:51.095
Can you believe that shit?

01:01:51.929 --> 01:01:56.684
Okay. Tell her I'll get out there
as soon as it's humanly possible.

01:01:57.393 --> 01:01:59.895
You can sleep on it
when you're supposed to be working.

01:02:00.062 --> 01:02:02.523
- Idiots.
- You ain 't no dope, that I must say.

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:06.151
That's why you didn 't leave that stick
around where nobody could find it.

01:02:06.318 --> 01:02:07.486
Oh, no.

01:02:07.653 --> 01:02:09.196
You got better sense than that.

01:02:10.364 --> 01:02:12.908
You took that bloody stick.

01:02:13.367 --> 01:02:14.868
And you washed it off real good.

01:02:15.035 --> 01:02:17.496
You threw it in the woods
where nobody could find it.

01:02:17.663 --> 01:02:20.165
You know, I think
you're a very silly man.

01:02:20.332 --> 01:02:24.586
It was you who was silly, thinking you
could wash off blood and you can 't.

01:02:26.297 --> 01:02:29.758
- Why can 't you wash off blood?
- Because you can 't.

01:02:29.925 --> 01:02:32.428
And the police know it.

01:02:32.594 --> 01:02:36.765
You can wash and you can wash,
yet there's always some left.

01:02:36.932 --> 01:02:38.892
Everybody knows that.

01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:40.436
I'm gonna call the police...

01:02:40.602 --> 01:02:44.148
...and I'm gonna tell them to start
looking for that stick in the woods.

01:02:45.399 --> 01:02:49.153
They got what they call "stick
bloodhounds" to help them look.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.490
And them stick bloodhounds
can find any stick there is...

01:02:53.657 --> 01:02:55.159
...that's got blood on it.

01:02:55.326 --> 01:02:57.995
When they bring in that stick
you wash off, the police...

01:02:58.162 --> 01:03:00.331
...are gonna sprinkle some special...

01:03:54.301 --> 01:03:56.470
You beat it out of my house.

01:03:56.637 --> 01:03:58.931
I've got my shotgun.

01:04:24.748 --> 01:04:26.667
You little shits.

01:04:27.793 --> 01:04:29.461
Scumbag.

01:04:29.628 --> 01:04:31.463
Vermin.

01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:33.173
I'll teach you.

01:04:33.507 --> 01:04:35.926
I'm calling the police.

01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:55.779
Damn kids.

01:07:46.575 --> 01:07:48.118
How did you...?

01:07:48.369 --> 01:07:50.162
What are you do...?

01:07:51.205 --> 01:07:53.040
What are you doing here?

01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:56.043
Who's down there?

01:07:56.543 --> 01:07:58.170
It's just me, Mom.

01:07:58.337 --> 01:08:00.214
I'm going to eat something.

01:08:09.264 --> 01:08:11.225
Don't you move.

01:08:22.194 --> 01:08:23.404
What are you doing?

01:08:23.569 --> 01:08:25.613
I dropped a glass.

01:08:25.781 --> 01:08:27.866
I was starving.

01:08:30.286 --> 01:08:32.621
Here. Let me help you clean up.

01:08:32.787 --> 01:08:34.665
No, that's all right. I can do it.

01:08:34.832 --> 01:08:36.834
Really, Mom, I can do it.

01:08:37.001 --> 01:08:39.795
I'm sorry about waking you up.
Go back to bed.

01:08:39.962 --> 01:08:41.505
I love you, mom.

01:08:44.466 --> 01:08:46.844
Well, that was worth waking up for.

01:08:48.053 --> 01:08:51.515
Look, I'm sorry if I've been
a little out of sorts.

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:53.934
It's been rough on all of us.

01:08:57.395 --> 01:08:58.439
Okay.

01:08:58.606 --> 01:08:59.898
I'm going back up.

01:09:00.064 --> 01:09:01.942
- Okay.
- Don't eat too much.

01:09:02.109 --> 01:09:03.944
It'll give you nightmares.

01:09:21.462 --> 01:09:24.465
Sam, you have to stay here now.

01:09:24.798 --> 01:09:27.176
There's no place else to put you.

01:09:37.353 --> 01:09:38.979
Sit down.

01:09:40.397 --> 01:09:42.066
There you go.

01:09:44.734 --> 01:09:47.613
I don't want you to go anywhere.

01:09:48.988 --> 01:09:50.157
Understand?

01:09:53.493 --> 01:09:56.246
I'll go downstairs
and get you some bedding.

01:09:57.665 --> 01:09:59.249
You still sleep, don't you?

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.230
Oh, God, Sam.

01:10:28.362 --> 01:10:30.781
God, what the hell happened
to her head?

01:10:31.782 --> 01:10:33.409
Back it up.

01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:37.538
Put her to one side, guys.
There's another body across the street.

01:10:37.705 --> 01:10:40.291
- Coming through.
- Stand back, please.

01:10:40.457 --> 01:10:43.502
- Ladies, please. No comment.
- Can we get the camera in here?

01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:46.213
We'll get some pictures
and get out of your way, okay?

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:50.050
Bring that stuff over here, will you?
Put it right along the curb here.

01:10:51.343 --> 01:10:54.638
Old man Pringle and Mrs. Parker.
Both dead.

01:10:55.556 --> 01:10:57.224
His face was burned off.

01:10:57.391 --> 01:10:58.976
Elvira Parker?

01:10:59.435 --> 01:11:02.479
Yeah, I heard somebody say
she called the police.

01:11:02.646 --> 01:11:05.608
Said she saw Sam
in her bedroom window.

01:11:05.774 --> 01:11:09.903
From what I hear, Elvira's head
is all over the walls in there.

01:11:12.489 --> 01:11:14.074
Are you all right?

01:11:14.241 --> 01:11:16.035
Come on, buddy.

01:12:55.843 --> 01:12:57.428
Paul?

01:13:08.022 --> 01:13:10.482
Paul? Is that you?

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:18.198
Hey, Mom?

01:13:18.365 --> 01:13:19.950
I'm home.

01:13:23.245 --> 01:13:25.080
There you are.

01:13:25.414 --> 01:13:28.125
I would have sworn
I heard you up in your room.

01:13:29.501 --> 01:13:31.086
Did you get the bread?

01:13:34.298 --> 01:13:36.258
Oh, your bread.

01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:38.135
No, I forgot that.

01:13:38.302 --> 01:13:39.887
I'm sorry.

01:13:44.892 --> 01:13:47.144
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:13:47.603 --> 01:13:49.647
Don't you ever listen?

01:13:51.357 --> 01:13:53.150
What are you doing down here?

01:13:54.735 --> 01:13:56.362
Sam.

01:14:08.457 --> 01:14:10.042
Paul. Telephone.

01:14:10.209 --> 01:14:12.252
I'll be down in a minute.

01:14:13.671 --> 01:14:15.589
It sounds important. It's Tom.

01:14:15.756 --> 01:14:17.091
I'm coming.

01:14:17.257 --> 01:14:18.968
Don't you move.

01:14:21.303 --> 01:14:23.597
I'll be back in a second, okay?

01:14:35.442 --> 01:14:37.361
I'm coming right back.

01:14:47.079 --> 01:14:48.330
I'm gonna tell, Paul.

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:51.125
I can 't keep this a secret anymore.

01:14:51.292 --> 01:14:52.960
I can't.

01:14:53.127 --> 01:14:54.878
Its eating me up alive.

01:14:56.588 --> 01:14:57.798
She's killing people.

01:14:57.965 --> 01:15:01.176
Look, we gotta talk. Not on the phone,
though. After school tomorrow.

01:15:01.343 --> 01:15:03.637
- There's nothing else to talk about.
- Tom.

01:15:03.804 --> 01:15:05.389
Come on. Don't do this.

01:15:05.556 --> 01:15:07.516
What's happening is too important.

01:15:07.975 --> 01:15:10.227
Tom, come on.

01:15:11.103 --> 01:15:12.813
Just give me a chance to explain.

01:15:13.647 --> 01:15:15.482
Just a half an hour.

01:15:16.609 --> 01:15:18.485
For our friendship.

01:15:18.736 --> 01:15:19.945
Understand?

01:15:25.451 --> 01:15:26.660
Jeannie.

01:15:26.827 --> 01:15:28.120
Dr. Johanson.

01:15:28.287 --> 01:15:30.914
Just checking in.
Wanted to know how Paul was doing.

01:15:31.081 --> 01:15:32.249
What do you mean?

01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:36.045
I haven't seen him for days.

01:15:36.211 --> 01:15:37.463
What?

01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:39.340
I figured he must be sick.

01:15:39.506 --> 01:15:41.258
Sick?

01:15:41.425 --> 01:15:42.676
He's been here every day.

01:15:43.636 --> 01:15:45.804
I drove him this morning.

01:15:59.652 --> 01:16:01.820
Hey, what happened here?

01:16:02.488 --> 01:16:04.365
Just come on up.

01:16:10.955 --> 01:16:12.414
Sam?

01:16:16.377 --> 01:16:17.962
Sam?

01:16:18.128 --> 01:16:19.838
Sam?

01:16:20.381 --> 01:16:21.882
Oh, shit.

01:16:23.801 --> 01:16:25.678
There you are.

01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:31.934
Hey, Sam, it's just me.

01:16:32.643 --> 01:16:34.687
Look who came to visit you.

01:16:35.312 --> 01:16:36.438
Do you know who this is?

01:16:37.439 --> 01:16:39.233
Sure you do.

01:16:40.234 --> 01:16:41.402
Come on over here.

01:16:48.075 --> 01:16:49.576
There you go.

01:16:58.294 --> 01:16:59.920
There you go.

01:17:00.254 --> 01:17:01.755
Come on over here.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.686
Go on, you two know each other.

01:17:20.524 --> 01:17:22.443
There we are.

01:17:25.863 --> 01:17:27.448
No way.

01:17:28.699 --> 01:17:30.451
Tom.

01:17:30.618 --> 01:17:32.411
- Tom, please.
- No way.

01:17:32.578 --> 01:17:33.871
I'm calling the cops.

01:17:34.038 --> 01:17:36.165
Damn you, Tom.
You said you'd give it a chance.

01:17:36.332 --> 01:17:37.666
Hey, come on.

01:17:38.208 --> 01:17:39.627
Hey.

01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:47.926
- Damn you.
- Shut up.

01:17:48.093 --> 01:17:50.054
You creep. You...

01:17:51.305 --> 01:17:52.848
Oh, God.

01:17:53.557 --> 01:17:55.809
Tom, I'm sorry.

01:18:00.606 --> 01:18:02.608
You and I are gonna have a talk.

01:18:05.152 --> 01:18:07.780
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- He's okay. He's okay.

01:18:07.947 --> 01:18:11.158
No. You've got a crazy man for a son.

01:18:12.785 --> 01:18:14.828
And I'm calling the cops.

01:18:14.995 --> 01:18:16.497
You know what I'm talking about.

01:18:17.164 --> 01:18:20.501
- Tom, you don't know what you're doing.
- You don't know what you've done.

01:18:20.668 --> 01:18:22.336
This is gonna stop.

01:18:22.503 --> 01:18:24.296
And I'm gonna stop you.

01:18:40.521 --> 01:18:41.647
Sam.

01:18:41.814 --> 01:18:43.691
What the hell are you doing?

01:18:43.857 --> 01:18:46.235
Are you trying to kill him? Huh?

01:19:14.555 --> 01:19:16.348
BB.

01:19:16.724 --> 01:19:18.225
Sam.

01:19:28.819 --> 01:19:30.487
Sam.

01:19:35.701 --> 01:19:37.578
What do you know?

01:19:38.203 --> 01:19:40.414
Where you going, punk?

01:19:45.711 --> 01:19:47.087
Where you going?

01:19:47.254 --> 01:19:48.589
Punk?

01:19:48.756 --> 01:19:51.216
Would you believe the luck?

01:19:54.762 --> 01:19:56.138
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Let me go.

01:19:56.305 --> 01:19:58.932
I waited a long time for this.

01:19:59.099 --> 01:20:02.311
Where's your little friend now, huh,
shit face?

01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:06.523
Where's little BB now?

01:20:07.107 --> 01:20:08.275
He's not here, is he?

01:20:08.442 --> 01:20:10.611
He's all blown up.

01:20:16.241 --> 01:20:17.451
Son of a...

01:20:17.618 --> 01:20:19.995
Get off of me.

01:20:25.626 --> 01:20:27.920
Come here! Get over there!

01:20:51.652 --> 01:20:53.570
BB.

01:20:57.283 --> 01:20:59.034
BB.

01:21:04.373 --> 01:21:06.208
What the...?

01:21:10.421 --> 01:21:11.672
Sam?

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:21.598
Sam?

01:21:27.187 --> 01:21:28.772
Hey, girl.

01:21:31.233 --> 01:21:32.776
I thought you...

01:21:36.864 --> 01:21:38.741
Okay, freeze, miss.

01:21:39.408 --> 01:21:41.952
Stay right where you are.

01:21:43.037 --> 01:21:44.705
Sam, no.

01:21:47.416 --> 01:21:48.792
BB.

01:22:04.808 --> 01:22:06.352
Stay there.

01:22:07.186 --> 01:22:09.939
- You don't wanna see this.
- Sam.

01:22:10.105 --> 01:22:11.190
Sam, stop.

01:22:11.357 --> 01:22:14.902
- She must've thrown him 30 feet.
- Mrs. Conway, get back in the car.

01:22:18.572 --> 01:22:20.741
Sam, stop!

01:22:27.581 --> 01:22:30.084
Hey. Look out. Are you crazy?

01:22:32.419 --> 01:22:34.838
- Sam.
- Okay, miss, hold it right there.

01:22:35.005 --> 01:22:36.423
Come on, hold it.

01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:37.925
Take it easy.

01:22:49.186 --> 01:22:51.146
Stay away from her.

01:22:52.147 --> 01:22:53.649
Sam.

01:22:55.859 --> 01:22:57.111
Sam.

01:23:00.364 --> 01:23:02.574
Sam?

01:23:46.577 --> 01:23:48.120
Sam.

01:23:48.662 --> 01:23:50.289
Listen to me.

01:23:52.333 --> 01:23:54.084
We can get help.

01:23:54.835 --> 01:23:56.920
Do you know Dr. Johanson?

01:23:58.172 --> 01:23:59.882
He can help us.

01:24:02.092 --> 01:24:03.552
Sam, please.

01:24:39.505 --> 01:24:41.048
Paul.

01:24:42.091 --> 01:24:43.676
Get away from her, Paul.

01:24:43.842 --> 01:24:46.804
No. She doesn't understand.

01:24:49.932 --> 01:24:51.475
Hold it, miss, right there.

01:24:53.519 --> 01:24:55.354
All right, miss, just keep calm.

01:24:55.521 --> 01:24:56.563
Freeze.

01:24:56.730 --> 01:24:57.773
Stop.

01:24:58.941 --> 01:25:01.068
Get away, Paul.

01:25:01.694 --> 01:25:02.945
Take it easy, now.

01:25:03.779 --> 01:25:05.155
No.

01:25:05.322 --> 01:25:06.573
No.

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:08.117
Don't move, Sam.

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.873
Don't move, Sam.

01:25:17.793 --> 01:25:19.920
Please, don't do anything crazy.

01:25:26.719 --> 01:25:27.761
Paul.

01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:31.265
Paul.

01:25:32.224 --> 01:25:33.267
Sam.

01:25:33.809 --> 01:25:35.436
Put your hands above your head.

01:25:36.145 --> 01:25:37.479
It's over.

01:25:42.735 --> 01:25:44.153
Oh, God. No.

01:25:54.455 --> 01:25:56.290
Stop.

01:25:58.459 --> 01:26:00.169
No.

01:26:11.722 --> 01:26:13.140
Paul.

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.444
Hey, radio for an ambulance.

01:26:28.697 --> 01:26:33.494
All right, you wanna keep back there?
Step over here, all of you. Thank you.

01:26:33.661 --> 01:26:35.496
Just keep back.

01:26:39.166 --> 01:26:42.962
We'll do a postmortem at 7 a.m.
Do you wanna be here?

01:26:43.796 --> 01:26:45.506
I'll be here.

01:26:45.923 --> 01:26:47.633
It should be interesting.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.009
One for the books.

01:27:43.397 --> 01:27:45.941
Okay, Sam, we're gonna get you
out of here.

01:28:09.923 --> 01:28:12.426
Paul, come with me, Paul.

01:28:12.593 --> 01:28:15.804
No!

01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:18.015
BB.
