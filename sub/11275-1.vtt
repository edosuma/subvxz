    Hi, Dr. Crane.              

00:10.000 --> 00:12.400
FRASIER:                        
Hello, Woody.                   

00:12.400 --> 00:13.600
      Set me up, will you?      

00:13.600 --> 00:14.500
        Coming right up.        

00:14.600 --> 00:15.700
Boy, you know,                  

00:15.700 --> 00:17.100
no matter how many times        
I come in here,                 

00:17.100 --> 00:18.300
I can't get over                
how silly you look              

00:18.300 --> 00:19.400
in that                         
ridiculous outfit.              

00:20.300 --> 00:22.600
            Really?             

00:22.600 --> 00:23.900
    I kind of like it.          

00:23.900 --> 00:25.700
          People treat me with  
          a little more respect.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.300
                  And there's   
                  another bonus.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.100
              Saves me that     
              couple extra hours

00:29.100 --> 00:30.700
                 I used to spend
                 every morning  

00:30.800 --> 00:32.100
            picking out a shirt.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.000
        Yes, that can be        
      very time consuming.      

00:37.400 --> 00:39.200
    Whatever happened           
     to the good old days?      

00:39.200 --> 00:41.500
Everything                      
was better.                     

00:41.500 --> 00:42.800
    Sam still owned the bar.    

00:42.800 --> 00:45.300
         He wasn't out          
  circumnavigating the globe.

with a book.

    fixtures in this place.

  those hail-fellows-well-met.  

00:54.200 --> 00:57.400
Where has it gone, Woody?       

00:57.500 --> 00:59.200
                  Oh, hey, come 
                  on, Dr. Crane.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.700
             It'll be all right.

  the days that are no more."   

01:16.600 --> 01:18.300
                    You did.    

01:18.300 --> 01:21.300
        No, no, you see,        
I mean who said it first?       

01:21.400 --> 01:25.100
    Y-You said it both times.   

01:26.900 --> 01:28.500
 You know, you're right, Woody. 

01:28.500 --> 01:30.100
Some things never change.       

01:30.100 --> 01:32.500
  Especially the simple ones.

 Last chance; I'm out of here.  

02:53.500 --> 02:54.800
                 You caught them
                 by surprise.   

02:54.800 --> 02:56.400
                I'm telling you,
                they'll get it.

to get it.

        Good, how are you?      
Good. You know,                 

03:09.200 --> 03:10.800
I passed Norm Peterson          
on the stairs.                  

03:10.800 --> 03:12.300
He didn't give me               
the time of day.                

03:12.300 --> 03:14.400
                  Oh, it's 3:15.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.700
        Thanks.                 

03:16.800 --> 03:17.700
Well, would you like a drink,   

03:17.700 --> 03:19.200
        or did you just         
        drop in for the time?   

03:19.200 --> 03:20.300
Now that you mentioned it.      

03:20.400 --> 03:21.500
Say, is, uh, Carla around?      

03:21.600 --> 03:23.100
            She said            
she wanted to talk to me.       

03:23.100 --> 03:24.500
Said it was real important, eh? 

03:24.600 --> 03:25.500
    She just went upstairs.     

03:25.600 --> 03:27.100
      She'll be back down       
          in a minute.

Good.                           

03:28.200 --> 03:30.100
        Well, we haven't seen   
        you for a while, eh?    

03:30.100 --> 03:32.300
  Yeah, you know, Carla and I   
     kind of drifted apart.     

03:32.400 --> 03:34.400
         I don't know,          
 I haven't seen her in months.  

03:34.400 --> 03:36.000
                    The usual?  
    You bet, Woody.             

03:36.100 --> 03:37.100
          Good memory.

      What is your usual?       

03:39.900 --> 03:42.300
    Uh, just give me a beer.

Sam around?                     

03:44.000 --> 03:45.400
            Oh, didn't you hear?
    No.                         

03:45.400 --> 03:47.800
        Sam sold the bar to     
        some big corporation.   

03:47.800 --> 03:49.000
                  Bought a boat.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.300
             He's sailing around
             the world with it. 

03:51.300 --> 03:52.400
    Hey, well, good for Sam.    

03:52.400 --> 03:54.100
    Thought he was supposed     
        to get married.

             Well, Miss Chambers

03:55.400 --> 03:56.500
  went off to write her book,   

03:56.600 --> 03:58.000
only that didn't work out,      

03:58.000 --> 04:00.200
    and last we heard,          
    she was out in Hollywood    

04:00.300 --> 04:01.500
    trying to write for TV.     

04:05.400 --> 04:06.900
              I'll bet whatever 
              she comes up with,

04:06.900 --> 04:08.000
                 it'll be pretty
                 darn good.

( <i>chuckling</i> )                   

04:09.100 --> 04:10.100

          Hey, Carla.           

04:18.700 --> 04:21.000
    What did you want           
      to talk to me about?      

04:26.400 --> 04:29.400
Okay, see ya.                   

04:29.400 --> 04:31.600

                      So, Carla,

04:33.600 --> 04:35.700
    what did Eddie say          
about his impending fatherhood? 

04:35.800 --> 04:38.000
He wants                        
to think about it.              

04:38.000 --> 04:39.400
                    Mmm.        

04:39.400 --> 04:40.700

                  is he'll do   

04:40.800 --> 04:43.400
         exactly what I or any  
         normal, red-blooded men

04:43.400 --> 04:44.900

              On the other hand,

04:46.200 --> 04:48.000
            you might actually  
            hear from him again.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.000
 to your around-the-world sail? 

05:44.000 --> 05:45.700
     Well, it kind of lost      
some of its appeal, Woody,      

05:45.800 --> 05:46.700
         after I sank.          

05:46.800 --> 05:48.400
              ALL:              
          Sank? Where?          

05:48.400 --> 05:50.000
  Somewhere in the Caribbean.   

05:50.100 --> 05:51.600
Well, you must                  
feel terrible.                  

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
     Well, no, not really.      

05:52.600 --> 05:54.200
        You know,               
 a lot of good came out of it.  

05:54.200 --> 05:55.100
I discovered a reef             

05:55.100 --> 05:56.600
that nobody                     
had ever heard of,              

05:56.600 --> 05:58.400
  and even named it after me.   

05:58.500 --> 05:59.800
    "No Brains Atoll."          

05:59.800 --> 06:00.900
          ( <i>laughter</i> )          

06:01.000 --> 06:03.800
( <i>Woody joins in</i> )              

06:03.800 --> 06:05.200
         Maybe you two          
should start calling each other 

06:05.200 --> 06:06.400
        in the morning.         

06:09.700 --> 06:11.700
                          Sammy,

06:11.800 --> 06:13.300
                 it's part of   
                 the new regime.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.200
      They're running this joint
      like a military outfit.   

06:16.200 --> 06:17.800
     Well, that's too bad.      

06:17.800 --> 06:18.900
Oh, no,                         
look at that.                   

06:18.900 --> 06:20.200
What happened                   
to my photograph?               

06:20.300 --> 06:21.500
          Never mind;           
        now you're back,        

06:21.500 --> 06:22.600
                you can buy     
                back the bar,   

06:22.600 --> 06:24.000
              things can be     
              the way they were.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.700
I don't have enough money       
to buy back an ice cube.        

06:26.800 --> 06:29.600
But anyway, you know, hey,      
I just want to work here.       

06:29.600 --> 06:30.800
                    If I can't  
                    be the boss,

06:30.800 --> 06:33.000
          I can at least be the 
          highest-paid employee.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.400
Yeah, well, I don't know.       

06:34.400 --> 06:36.200
We got two bartenders           
already, Sam.                   

06:36.200 --> 06:37.200
            You're kidding. Who?

06:37.300 --> 06:38.600
Well, hold onto                 
your sides.                     

06:38.700 --> 06:41.000
I'm going to introduce you      
to Mr. Chucklepuss.             

06:41.100 --> 06:42.200
                Hey, Wayne.     

06:42.300 --> 06:43.800
Sam...                          

06:43.800 --> 06:45.400
         this is Wayne;         
    Wayne, Sam Malone.          

06:45.500 --> 06:47.100
    How do you do?              
                    Hello.      

06:47.100 --> 06:49.600
 Sorry, Wayne, but Sam is going 
     to take over your job.     

06:49.700 --> 06:51.000
Yeah, well,                     
there's no reason               

06:51.100 --> 06:52.900
why you can't hang around       

06:53.000 --> 06:54.700
and be a relief bartender.      

06:54.700 --> 06:57.000
            I'm hardly a        
            relief bartender.   

06:57.100 --> 06:58.100
      Yeah, that's right.       

06:58.200 --> 06:59.300
             You know, uh, Wayne

06:59.300 --> 07:01.100
              has bored the hell
              out of people     

07:01.100 --> 07:04.200
      in some of the finest bars
      and restaurants in Boston.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.600
          And as he'd be the    
          first one to tell you,

07:06.600 --> 07:08.700
             he can make any    
             drink known to man.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.100
Oh, is that right?              

07:10.100 --> 07:11.700
Try me.                         
            Okay.               

07:11.800 --> 07:13.000
        Um, a moonbeam.         

07:13.000 --> 07:14.100
With or without                 
curaçao?                        

07:14.200 --> 07:15.400
              Serendipity, neat.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.200
That only comes with ice.       

07:16.300 --> 07:17.600
                Saddleback.     
Onion or olive?                 

07:17.700 --> 07:19.300
            Both. Stick 'em     
            in your nostrils.   

07:19.400 --> 07:20.500
                ( <i>chuckles</i> )    

07:25.700 --> 07:27.100
    Well, that's all right.     

07:27.100 --> 07:29.500
             What the hell, I'll
             just come at this  
             from another angle.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.400
         Uh, who's, uh,         
  who's running the show now?   

07:31.400 --> 07:33.600
    Oh, no, no, I-I wouldn't    
     approach it that way.      

07:33.600 --> 07:36.800
No, this new manager            
eats live sharks for breakfast. 

07:36.800 --> 07:38.300
Ah, but don't go by me.         

07:38.400 --> 07:40.600
I've hated every boss           
I've ever had.                  

07:40.700 --> 07:42.000
        How can you say that?   

07:42.100 --> 07:43.100
                I was your boss.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.200
    Yeah, right.                

07:44.300 --> 07:46.000
             Oh, I was; come on.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.800
Anyway,                         
I really hate her.              

07:47.800 --> 07:50.100
     "Her"? Whoa-- a woman?     

07:50.200 --> 07:52.200
      Oh, is she married?       

07:52.200 --> 07:53.300
Who'd marry her?                

07:53.300 --> 07:54.600
      An unmarried woman.       

07:54.600 --> 07:57.400
     Might take me all of five  
     minutes to get my job back.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.700
    Ha-ha-ha.                   

07:58.700 --> 08:00.100
                      Why? What?

08:00.100 --> 08:02.100
Oh, no, what, is she            
one of those pasty-faced        

08:02.100 --> 08:04.300
little business school          
graduates with thick glasses    

08:04.400 --> 08:05.800
and her hair pulled back        
so tight                        

08:05.800 --> 08:07.700
she hears through her eyes--    
one of those?                   

08:07.700 --> 08:09.000
         She's coming right now.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.800
                Why don't you be

08:10.900 --> 08:11.500
              the judge of that?

08:11.500 --> 08:12.700
    Watch this.                 

08:12.700 --> 08:14.600
        I came up               
    with a few new grabbers     

08:14.700 --> 08:17.400
    while I was out at sea.     

08:19.000 --> 08:21.400
        Mm-boo-ah.              

08:30.700 --> 08:32.799
    Miss Rebecca Howe,          
          Sam Malone.           

08:32.900 --> 08:34.400
    Sam, Rebecca Howe.          

08:34.400 --> 08:35.700
How do you do?                  

08:35.700 --> 08:37.600
        Ah-voo-ah.              

08:39.200 --> 08:40.700
    And to you.                 

08:40.799 --> 08:42.799
If you'll excuse me.            

08:45.800 --> 08:47.000
    Boy, you know,              

08:47.000 --> 08:48.700
she's almost as great-looking   
as I am.                        

08:48.700 --> 08:50.800
CARLA:                          
Almost.                         

08:50.900 --> 08:53.500
Gee, I wonder what              
she'll make me for breakfast?   

08:56.700 --> 08:57.800
         Miss Tortelli, you have

08:57.800 --> 08:59.200
        a couple of customers   
        in the corner           

08:59.200 --> 09:01.300
    that look like they're on   
    the verge of a good time.   

09:01.300 --> 09:04.000
  You better hurry over there   
 and put your usual stop to it. 

09:04.000 --> 09:05.700
Yes, ma'am.                     

09:11.500 --> 09:14.000
                 Good afternoon,
                 Miss Howe.     

09:14.000 --> 09:15.100
    Hello, Woody.               

09:15.100 --> 09:16.700
         I mean Wayne.          

09:16.700 --> 09:19.600
          Did you lose          
      your name tag again?      

09:19.700 --> 09:20.900
                        Yeah.   

09:21.000 --> 09:23.200
        But I found my pants.   

09:26.000 --> 09:28.100
Keep up the good work,          
Woody.                          

09:28.100 --> 09:29.800
Uh, excuse me.                  

09:29.900 --> 09:31.200
Um, I want to apologize         

09:31.300 --> 09:32.800
for my behavior                 
back there.                     

09:32.800 --> 09:34.100
    I was led astray.           

09:34.200 --> 09:38.200
Somebody told me that you were  
kind of a schnauzer.            

09:38.300 --> 09:40.600
                Uh-- Sam Malone.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.400
        Yes. Yes.               
            You're the gentleman

09:42.400 --> 09:43.900
                that used to    
                own this bar.   

09:43.900 --> 09:46.000
    Well, I heard you were      
    sailing around the world.   

09:46.000 --> 09:47.600
Well, I was going               
to do that, but, uh,            

09:47.600 --> 09:49.500
something                       
kept pulling me back here,      

09:49.500 --> 09:52.300
and I just couldn't figure out  
what it was, till now.          

09:52.300 --> 09:54.800
              Which reminds me  
              of the other thing
              I heard about you.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.900
( <i>chuckling</i> ):                  
Oh, no...                       

09:56.900 --> 09:58.600
        Wait, let me set        
the record straight here.       

09:58.700 --> 10:00.300
        There have been         
      a lot of ridiculous,      

10:00.400 --> 10:03.200
unbelievable rumors             
about my sexual prowess.        

10:03.200 --> 10:05.800
    I just want to tell you     
    that most of them           

10:05.800 --> 10:07.400
    are right on the money.     

10:07.400 --> 10:08.800
     You know, Mr. Malone,      

10:08.800 --> 10:11.300
     we've known each other     
         only seconds,          

10:11.300 --> 10:13.400
 and I'm already tired of you.  

10:14.500 --> 10:15.900
Uh, w-w-wait                    
a minute,                       

10:15.900 --> 10:17.300
         wait a minute.         

10:17.300 --> 10:18.400
I know                          
you think you've had            

10:18.400 --> 10:20.600
  just about enough excitement  
          for one day,          

10:20.700 --> 10:22.000
    but there's more.           

10:22.000 --> 10:25.200
I'm back... and I'm ready       
to jump behind the bar.         

10:25.300 --> 10:27.400
            We're fully staffed,
            Mr. Malone.         

10:27.400 --> 10:28.800
            Jump somewhere else.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.300
  Uh, well, hold on a second.   

10:30.300 --> 10:32.800
Can't we, uh,                   
can't we discuss this?          

10:32.800 --> 10:34.100
                We just did.    

10:34.100 --> 10:36.100
No, no, no,                     
I meant someplace private       

10:36.200 --> 10:38.300
where we could                  
slip out of our things          

10:38.300 --> 10:40.500
and say howdy.

                    I don't know

10:41.300 --> 10:42.500
                if I find       
                your come-ons   

10:42.500 --> 10:44.000
                disgusting or   
                merely pathetic.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.800
            I do know you're    
            giving me a headache

10:45.800 --> 10:47.000
                behind the eyes.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.900
                 It feels like  
                 a little insect

10:50.000 --> 10:52.300
        boring into my brain.   

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
             Oh...!             

10:59.300 --> 11:00.400
    You didn't knock.           

11:00.400 --> 11:02.100
             Habit.             

11:02.100 --> 11:05.800
    Oh, my God.                 

11:05.800 --> 11:07.500
Boy, this place                 
doesn't even look               

11:07.500 --> 11:08.800
like my office anymore.         

11:08.800 --> 11:11.100
Thank you; it wasn't easy.      

11:11.100 --> 11:12.400
     How could you do this?     

11:12.500 --> 11:14.400
            I mean,             
  you-you took away all the...  

11:14.500 --> 11:17.300
all the charm,                  
all the warmth.                 

11:17.300 --> 11:18.600
Where's Dave?                   

11:18.600 --> 11:19.800
                "Dave"?         

11:19.800 --> 11:22.700
    My moose head.              

11:22.800 --> 11:24.700
        I set him free.         

11:26.400 --> 11:29.800
    If he really loves you,     
        he'll come back.        

11:32.500 --> 11:34.900
          This is, uh,          
a lot of changes to absorb      

11:34.900 --> 11:36.500
in such a short time here.      

11:36.600 --> 11:38.000
Would you just get out of here? 

11:38.000 --> 11:39.300
         ( <i>chuckling</i> ):         
    Oh, hey, come on.           

11:39.300 --> 11:40.500
          Lighten up.           

11:40.500 --> 11:42.100
         Running a bar          
    should be fun, you know?    

11:42.100 --> 11:44.000
              No, visiting a    
              bar should be fun.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.600
                Running a bar   
                is hard work.   

11:45.600 --> 11:48.600
  Mr. Malone, I have had a great
  deal of training and education

11:48.600 --> 11:50.800
        to get to this point,   
        and it's important to me

11:50.900 --> 11:52.400
                that I succeed; 
                that <i>it</i> succeed.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.500
Well, in that case,             

11:53.600 --> 11:55.900
          you're missing a great
          opportunity here.     

11:56.000 --> 11:58.600
        You see, having a sports
        celebrity in the bar    

11:58.700 --> 12:00.000
          is great for business.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.200
I mean, you take a look         
at your, uh...                  

12:02.300 --> 12:03.900
You take a look                 
at your, uh,                    

12:03.900 --> 12:06.200
at your major places            
in Atlantic City.               

12:06.200 --> 12:07.800
They got your Willie Mays,      

12:07.800 --> 12:09.300
your Mickey Mantle...           

12:09.400 --> 12:11.400
            It seems            
a critical difference here      

12:11.500 --> 12:13.600
    is that I've heard          
        of those people.        

12:13.600 --> 12:16.000
    Oh, now...                  

12:16.100 --> 12:17.500
Wait a second here.             

12:17.500 --> 12:19.400
You know, a lot of people       
may not know this,              

12:19.500 --> 12:21.400
but I happen to be              
quite famous.                   

12:24.100 --> 12:26.200
          Well, I don't care if 
          you're famous or not--

12:26.200 --> 12:27.500
    I don't need a bartender.   

12:27.500 --> 12:28.900
But you're                      
perfectly welcome               

12:29.000 --> 12:30.600
to come here                    
as a patron anytime.            

12:30.600 --> 12:31.900
And I personally                
guarantee                       

12:32.000 --> 12:33.900
you'll be treated               
with every courtesy.            

12:33.900 --> 12:36.000
Unless you're waited on         
by Miss Tortelli.               

12:36.100 --> 12:38.700
Now, if you don't mind...       

12:40.700 --> 12:42.400
Wait-wait a second here.        

12:42.400 --> 12:44.900
        Um...                   

12:44.900 --> 12:46.000
I sold this bar                 

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
because it had a lot of, uh,    

12:48.000 --> 12:49.500
bad memories for me.            

12:49.500 --> 12:51.600
But once I got away from it,    

12:51.700 --> 12:52.700
I realized that it had          

12:52.700 --> 12:54.000
a lot of good memories, too.    

12:54.000 --> 12:54.800
    Mr. Malone, I really...     

12:54.900 --> 12:56.300
Please, please listen.          

12:56.300 --> 12:58.300
I'm not enjoying this, either.  

13:00.000 --> 13:02.600
There was, uh, one memory       

13:02.700 --> 13:03.400
in particular that              

13:03.500 --> 13:05.100
                I have been     
                trying to shake.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.900
            ( <i>clears throat</i> )   

13:06.900 --> 13:07.900
                 See, I was, uh,

13:07.900 --> 13:09.600
                I was afraid    
                that I was gonna

13:09.600 --> 13:11.500
            walk in here        
            today, and, uh...   

13:11.500 --> 13:13.400
          see her face          
      everywhere I looked,      

13:13.500 --> 13:15.100
  but instead, what I saw was   

13:15.200 --> 13:17.600
    all these silly changes     
    you made in here.           

13:17.700 --> 13:19.100
I happen to think it's...       

13:19.100 --> 13:20.700
                 No, no, I mean,
                 it was good.   

13:20.800 --> 13:22.600
                It helped me.   

13:22.600 --> 13:24.500
Look, what I'm trying to say is,

13:24.600 --> 13:26.600
         uh, this place         
      is the closest thing      

13:26.600 --> 13:28.400
     I have to a real home.     

13:28.500 --> 13:30.600
      I want to come back.      

13:30.600 --> 13:32.900
            Please.             

13:33.800 --> 13:36.800
I'm very sorry, Mr. Malone.     

13:36.900 --> 13:39.400
I wish that I could help.       

13:44.900 --> 13:47.200
I see.                          

13:47.300 --> 13:49.500
         Wait a minute.         

13:51.900 --> 13:53.500
            I guess we could use

13:53.500 --> 13:56.600
    another relief bartender    
a couple of nights a week.      

13:57.600 --> 13:59.000
      Well, it's a start.       

13:59.000 --> 14:00.500
    I appreciate that.          

14:00.500 --> 14:01.600
    Don't mention it.           

14:01.600 --> 14:02.900
 You've had some tough breaks.  

14:03.000 --> 14:04.900
     Oh, not so bad really.     

14:04.900 --> 14:06.300
    You lost the bar.           

14:07.400 --> 14:09.200
      And now you tell me       
    that's your home.           

14:09.200 --> 14:11.600
You lost your girlfriend.       

14:11.700 --> 14:14.100
      And I guess you were      
    some sort of an athlete     

14:14.100 --> 14:16.200
                    who's having

14:16.200 --> 14:19.100
        a lot of trouble        
        getting over it.        

14:20.100 --> 14:21.400
                         Anyway,

14:21.400 --> 14:23.900
    I just hope working here    

14:24.000 --> 14:28.500
     can help fill a little     
    of the emptiness.           

14:31.600 --> 14:35.300
 Yeah, well, I'm sure it will.  

14:35.300 --> 14:37.300
         Thanks again.          

14:39.700 --> 14:41.800
You're not doing this           
out of pity, are you?           

14:41.800 --> 14:43.000
             Pity?              

14:43.000 --> 14:44.200
Well, yeah. I...                

14:44.200 --> 14:46.400
I can't take this job           
if it's just pity.              

14:46.500 --> 14:48.400
      It's not just pity.       
    There are other things.     

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
        Oh. Well, good.         

14:49.500 --> 14:50.700
        Like what?              

14:50.700 --> 14:53.000
            Like...             

14:53.000 --> 14:55.200
        It's pity.              

14:59.100 --> 15:00.700
Just pity?                      

15:00.700 --> 15:02.400
        Just pity.              

15:02.400 --> 15:04.800
          No respect?           

15:04.800 --> 15:06.000
              No.               

15:07.000 --> 15:10.400
    No personal value?          

15:13.300 --> 15:15.400
Do you like my shirt?           

15:15.500 --> 15:16.800
Actually, that's a great shirt. 

15:16.800 --> 15:18.700
Well, you know                  
what they say.                  

15:18.800 --> 15:20.400
Uh, pity and a nice shirt,      

15:20.500 --> 15:22.500
and the world's                 
your oyster, huh?               

15:26.600 --> 15:28.300
        Well, uh, I got the job.

Wow!

            part time, you know.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.300
            I mean, you do      
            have two bartenders.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.300
Yeah, well,                     
maybe not for long.

         Give it to me.         
    No, wait a minute.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.600
            listen in on my     
            phone conversations.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.800
Never. I'm insulted.            

16:30.800 --> 16:32.000
                Show me how to  
                do it, will you?

16:32.100 --> 16:33.400
Just press that third button,   

16:33.400 --> 16:34.600
pick up the receiver.           

16:37.500 --> 16:40.200
Well, no, I have not sent       
that statement over yet,        

16:40.200 --> 16:41.800
  but I'll send it right away.  

16:41.900 --> 16:44.000
      No, it's no problem,      
          I love you.           

16:44.000 --> 16:45.800
      I mean, I'd love to.      

16:47.100 --> 16:49.600
          I'd love to.          

16:49.600 --> 16:53.700
        Oh, by the way,         
I hired a new relief bartender. 

16:53.700 --> 16:55.500
  Kind of a sad case, really.   

16:55.600 --> 16:58.000
          Sam Malone.           
  Used to play for the Red...   

16:58.100 --> 17:01.500
        Yes, that's him.        

17:01.600 --> 17:05.400
    Well, of course I tried     
     to get him full time.      

17:06.400 --> 17:09.300
    Wonderful drawing card.     

17:11.300 --> 17:13.000
        Yes, sir.               

17:13.099 --> 17:14.800
    I'll sweeten the offer.     

17:14.800 --> 17:16.200
        Of course.              

17:16.300 --> 17:17.500
        Thank you.              

17:17.599 --> 17:19.200
        Good-bye.               

17:21.099 --> 17:22.900
             Rats.              

17:27.099 --> 17:28.200
          Mr. Malone?           

17:28.200 --> 17:29.700
 May I speak with you a moment? 

17:29.700 --> 17:31.900
    Sure, what's up, Becky?     

17:36.900 --> 17:39.200
I've just been                  
in there thinking.              
                    Mm-hmm.     

17:39.300 --> 17:41.100
You know, maybe I'm cutting off 

17:41.100 --> 17:43.800
     the bar's association      
    with sports too quickly.    

17:43.800 --> 17:45.400
    Oh, I don't know, Becks,    

17:45.500 --> 17:46.700
          I think you were right

17:46.700 --> 17:47.800
      in the first place.       

17:47.800 --> 17:50.500
        Besides, I, uh,         
I don't think I could live      

17:50.600 --> 17:52.900
on a relief bartender's salary. 

17:52.900 --> 17:54.900
        Well, what if I         
      made you full time?       

17:54.900 --> 17:56.900
 I don't think I could survive  

17:56.900 --> 17:59.200
      on a full-time bartender's
      paycheck, either.         

17:59.300 --> 18:02.400
Does that, uh, include          
all the usual perks--           

18:02.400 --> 18:03.600
medical,                        

18:03.600 --> 18:04.800
            dental,             

18:04.800 --> 18:06.000
          horizontal?           

18:09.200 --> 18:11.800
        Mr. Malone, we can      
        discuss the terms later.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.000
             The important thing

18:13.000 --> 18:15.200
              is that you come  
              back to work here.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.300
    Oh, I don't know.           

18:20.400 --> 18:23.100
                 ( <i>lackluster</i> ):
                 Please.        

18:23.200 --> 18:24.500
Since you're                    
practically begging--           

18:24.600 --> 18:26.800
      Ha!-- yeah, I guess       
     I could take the job.      

18:26.800 --> 18:28.500
Uh, you know, I'm gonna         

18:28.500 --> 18:30.600
hate the see Wayne              
hit the streets.                

18:30.700 --> 18:31.700
                Yes, I agree.   

18:31.700 --> 18:34.500
        Woody, may I see you    
        in my office, please?   

18:34.500 --> 18:35.600
You bet, Miss Howe.             

18:35.600 --> 18:37.800
            SAM:                
            No, no, wait, uh,   
            no, not Woody.      

18:37.900 --> 18:39.400
Uh, what about Wayne?           

18:39.400 --> 18:42.700
      I happen to think Wayne is
      a very talented bartender.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.000
I don't think he's so great.    

18:44.000 --> 18:45.500
            No, Ms. Tortelli?   

18:45.500 --> 18:46.700
                          CARLA:
                          No.   

18:46.700 --> 18:49.200
I bet there are a lot of drinks 
he doesn't know how to make.    

18:49.200 --> 18:50.200
Impossible.                     

18:50.300 --> 18:51.900
I know every drink there is.    

18:52.800 --> 18:54.000
            Oh, yeah?           

18:54.100 --> 18:57.700
  I say that a customer is gonna
  come into this bar tonight    

18:57.700 --> 19:00.200
          and order a drink     
          you've never heard of.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.000
No way, never happen.           

19:02.000 --> 19:05.400
            Well, if it does,   

19:05.400 --> 19:07.100
        will you take a hike?   

19:07.200 --> 19:08.200
All right.                      

19:08.300 --> 19:09.200
And if I win?                   

19:09.200 --> 19:12.200
    Then you get Sam's sailboat.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.200
                      Deal, Sam?

19:15.200 --> 19:17.000
                    It's a deal.

19:17.000 --> 19:17.900
You're on.                      

19:17.900 --> 19:19.000
I love sailing.                 

19:21.200 --> 19:22.400
        Oh.                     

19:22.400 --> 19:25.200
    This looks like a nice,     
        friendly tavern.        

19:25.300 --> 19:26.900
  Heck, I'll give it a chance.  

19:27.000 --> 19:28.100
        Norm!                   

19:28.100 --> 19:30.000
      Not now, you idiot.       

19:34.300 --> 19:35.700
        Yes, sir.               

19:35.700 --> 19:36.800
                      Let's see.

19:36.900 --> 19:39.100
                What do I       
                feel like today?

19:39.100 --> 19:40.300
                What am I in    
                the mood for?   

19:40.400 --> 19:43.200
    I guess a, uh,              
    Screaming Viking'd do it.   

19:43.200 --> 19:44.100
                Don't you, uh   

19:44.100 --> 19:45.900
          mean a Laughing Swede?

19:45.900 --> 19:47.500
                    No.         

19:49.000 --> 19:51.100
What's the matter, Wayne?       

19:51.200 --> 19:52.500
You heard the man.              

19:52.600 --> 19:54.800
                 That drink     
                 does not exist.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.400
                  There's been  
                  many a morning

19:56.400 --> 19:58.400
                  I wished to   
                  God it hadn't.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.500
    I've never heard            
    of that drink,              

20:02.500 --> 20:04.000
    and no one                  
    else has, either.           

20:04.100 --> 20:05.400
                  This gentleman
                  made it up.   

20:05.400 --> 20:06.900
             Do I have to take  
             my business else...

20:06.900 --> 20:08.500
            No, please, sir.    

20:08.600 --> 20:10.400
    Excuse me, Miss Howe,       
    I can make that.            

20:10.400 --> 20:11.800
 You want the cucumber bruised? 

20:11.900 --> 20:12.700
                    Slightly.   

20:18.400 --> 20:21.100
Shall I get your coat, Wayne?   

20:21.200 --> 20:23.900
     There is no such thing     
     as a Screaming Viking.     

20:23.900 --> 20:25.400
    I assure you, Miss Howe.    

20:25.400 --> 20:27.400
        Screaming Viking        
    over here, please.          

20:27.400 --> 20:29.700
  I don't know what's going on  
here, but I've been a barten... 

20:29.700 --> 20:31.200
    Bartender, make it two.     

20:31.200 --> 20:31.900
        Coming right up.        

20:31.900 --> 20:33.300
WAYNE:                          
Wait a minute!                  

20:33.400 --> 20:34.400
     There is no such drink     
    as a Screaming...           

20:34.500 --> 20:37.000
     Uh, I think I'll have      
      a Screaming Viking.       

20:39.200 --> 20:41.600
Although, the, uh...            

20:41.700 --> 20:42.600
    the name itself             
    is a misnomer,              

20:42.600 --> 20:44.100
    since the Vikings           
    were not actually           

20:44.100 --> 20:45.100
    the murderous plunder...    

20:45.200 --> 20:46.700
Would you shut up!              

20:47.200 --> 20:51.000
And welcome, stranger.          

20:51.100 --> 20:52.500
            You know what I'm   
            in the mood for?    

20:52.500 --> 20:54.400
Screaming Viking.               

20:54.400 --> 20:56.200
            PATRONS:            
    Screaming Viking!           
    Screaming Viking!           

20:56.300 --> 20:57.300
         Yeah, Screaming Viking.

20:57.300 --> 20:58.400
    Screaming Viking!           
    Screaming Viking!           

20:58.500 --> 20:59.600
        Miss Howe!              

20:59.600 --> 21:01.400
        I'm sorry.              
    I gave it a shot.           

21:01.500 --> 21:03.500
         But obviously,         
         I am not liked         

21:03.600 --> 21:05.300
by the customers                
or the employees.               

21:05.300 --> 21:06.800
Screaming Viking!               

21:06.800 --> 21:10.300
I haven't been called that      
      since my honeymoon.       

21:13.800 --> 21:14.800
Mr. Malone?                     

21:14.900 --> 21:17.000
May I see you in my office?     

21:17.000 --> 21:18.900
          Yes, ma'am.           

21:19.900 --> 21:21.500
                    Whoo-hoo.   

21:21.500 --> 21:23.700
Here's to the best              
Screaming Viking in town.       

21:23.700 --> 21:24.800
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )          

21:39.300 --> 21:41.600
    ( <i>all grumbling</i> )           

21:46.700 --> 21:48.300
                    Here you go.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.900
What's this?                    

21:49.900 --> 21:51.200
              A severance check.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.900
        Please be a stranger.   

21:54.000 --> 21:55.200
          Why? Wha...           

21:55.200 --> 21:56.800
         What did I do?         

21:56.900 --> 21:59.000
  In baseball-ese, Mr. Malone,  

21:59.000 --> 22:00.300
    you showed me up.           

22:00.400 --> 22:01.700
                You and the rest

22:01.800 --> 22:02.900
of the katzenjammer kids.       

22:02.900 --> 22:04.100
        Good-bye.               

22:04.100 --> 22:05.100
      Now, wait a minute.       

22:05.100 --> 22:07.200
  What about that conversation  
    you had with your, uh...    

22:11.900 --> 22:14.100
            My what?            

22:14.100 --> 22:15.700
        Your-your heart.        

22:15.700 --> 22:16.900
          Your heart.           

22:17.000 --> 22:18.800
         Y-You pity me.         

22:18.800 --> 22:21.700
    You've spent your pity,     
          Mr. Malone.           

22:21.700 --> 22:22.600
          Okay, fine.           

22:22.700 --> 22:25.100
    Yeah, you know, I don't     
    want your pity, anyway.     

22:25.100 --> 22:27.300
You know, I can live            
without this job.               

22:27.300 --> 22:29.800
I'll find another way           
of supporting myself.           

22:29.800 --> 22:31.400
         And my mother.         

22:33.600 --> 22:35.300
        I mean, now that        
  the doctor's only giving me   

22:35.300 --> 22:36.600
      six months to live.       

22:37.800 --> 22:38.500
Come on!                        

22:38.600 --> 22:39.800
Please listen.                  

22:39.800 --> 22:42.100
I swear to you, nothing like    
this'll ever happen again.      

22:42.100 --> 22:45.100
Come on, a decent boss          
would give me a second chance.  

22:45.100 --> 22:47.000
And I'll tell                   
you something, I...             

22:47.000 --> 22:48.900
Don't say, "A guy would."       

22:49.000 --> 22:51.900
      I wasn't gonna say,       
         "A guy would."         

22:51.900 --> 22:53.700
         But he would.          

22:55.200 --> 22:56.300
        All right.              

22:56.300 --> 22:57.800
 I'll give you another chance.  

22:57.800 --> 22:59.400
     All right, thank you.      
        Thank you.              

22:59.500 --> 23:01.300
        But I want to make      
        something very clear.   

23:01.400 --> 23:02.900
Okay.                           

23:03.000 --> 23:04.500
                You've just got 
                one chance left.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.600
Mm-hmm.                         

23:05.700 --> 23:07.700
                 And as far as  
                 I'm concerned--

23:07.700 --> 23:09.500
        again, in baseball-ese--

23:09.500 --> 23:11.000
it's the bottom of the ninth,   

23:11.100 --> 23:12.500
            you've got two outs,

23:12.500 --> 23:13.700
                    two strikes,

23:13.700 --> 23:15.600
            and no balls.       

23:17.700 --> 23:19.500
Okay, all right.                

23:19.500 --> 23:22.200
I'm still at the plate,         
though, right?                  

23:22.200 --> 23:23.300
                Right.          

23:23.300 --> 23:24.500
All right.                      

23:24.600 --> 23:26.600
    Now, I think Woody          
    would probably appreciate   

23:26.600 --> 23:27.800
        a little help out there.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.600
Yes, ma'am.                     

23:30.600 --> 23:32.400
Can...                          

23:32.500 --> 23:34.600
         Can I ask you          
     just one small favor?      

23:34.600 --> 23:35.700
             What?              

23:35.700 --> 23:37.800
      Can I see you smile?      

23:37.800 --> 23:40.000
              Why?              

23:40.000 --> 23:41.700
     You know, it'd just be     
      a friendly gesture,       

23:41.800 --> 23:43.200
            to prove            
  there are no hard feelings.   

23:43.200 --> 23:44.400
Oh, come on,                    

23:44.500 --> 23:45.900
 I bet you're the kind of girl  

23:45.900 --> 23:47.900
     that lights up a room      
        when she smiles.        

23:48.800 --> 23:52.000
         That's stupid.         

23:52.000 --> 23:53.100
  I'll give you a little help.  

23:53.100 --> 23:53.900
Watch this, watch this.         

23:54.000 --> 23:55.800
              Hmm.              

23:59.900 --> 24:02.500
    Gee, I was wrong.           

24:03.305 --> 24:09.881
