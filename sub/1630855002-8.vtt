WEBVTT

00:19.352 --> 00:20.353
Come on.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.738
<i>I came to New York
to be a writer.</i>

00:30.238 --> 00:33.241
<i>And sure, some distractions
got in the way.</i>

00:34.367 --> 00:38.413
But I stand before you today
recommitted to my craft.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.750
If given this incredible opportunity,

00:41.750 --> 00:46.337
I am confident that I will be
the discreet, tidy, easygoing,

00:46.337 --> 00:49.549
you'll-never-even-know-I'm-there
roommate

00:49.549 --> 00:51.301
that you've been looking for.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.054
What do you think, Dave?

00:55.388 --> 00:56.514
Sure. Yeah.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.683
- Room is yours.
(gasping) Really?

00:59.225 --> 01:00.977
Oh my god. Great.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.562
Because I've been staying
at the YMCA,

01:02.562 --> 01:04.773
and I'm not sure
what the song is talking about

01:04.773 --> 01:06.858
because "fun" is
definitely not the

01:06.858 --> 01:08.151
first word that comes to mind.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.028
Well, I was just telling
Dave that, uh,

01:10.028 --> 01:12.197
we need some more
female energy here.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.991
Yeah, I-I'm curious.
How, how did you two meet?

01:14.991 --> 01:17.786
I was just coming back
from a year abroad, and, uh,

01:17.786 --> 01:19.496
bumped into Marta
right outside the building.

01:19.954 --> 01:22.874
- Almost like she was waiting for me.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.876
Almost.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.377
We started talking and

01:26.836 --> 01:28.588
turns out we had
so much in common.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.006
Like, her favorite books
are literally

01:30.006 --> 01:31.257
the same ones
I have on my shelf.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.384
That is so crazy.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.804
It's not that crazy.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.722
Do you have a boyfriend or?

01:39.224 --> 01:41.851
Um, no. No, I'm--

01:42.435 --> 01:43.978
- Mm-mm, no.
Well, I should warn you,

01:43.978 --> 01:45.855
the room we have available
is very small.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.483
I mean, it's definitely
not a closet, but--

01:48.483 --> 01:50.193
I'm sure it's perfect.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.654
- I'm telling ya,

01:52.654 --> 01:54.989
it's all smiles out there
at the Christmas party,

01:54.989 --> 01:57.283
- but we are at Defcon Fucked.
- Damn.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.994
They're saying hundreds of
clients' personal info leaked.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.871
No one's seen
a data breach like this before.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.456
I.T. is shitting itself.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.291
But it's nothing
compared to what's coming.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.751
Y2K?

02:06.751 --> 02:08.753
We're talking four horsemen
at the apocalypse shit.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.381
Hey, you're welcome to join us
at my parents' place out East.

02:12.715 --> 02:15.635
That's very generous of you,
but I think I'm good. Thanks.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.345
Oh, just gonna

02:17.887 --> 02:20.723
cuddle in with Random Lindsay
for the holidays, huh?

02:20.723 --> 02:24.060
- Huh?
- Yeah... something like that.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.395
Sorry, Chris.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.230
No room at the pad for you,
I'm afraid.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.065
Associates and above only.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.525
Totally get it, fellas.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.569
I, I appreciate you even
thinking of me.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.653
We didn't.

02:34.404 --> 02:38.324
(laughs) Well,

05:38.713 --> 05:41.341
I'm gonna say it.
It's better without him.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.719
It's so nice to be
alone. Without her.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.763
- Definitely quieter.
- And less crazy.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.474
Don't forget, he kissed
his ex-girlfriend...

05:49.474 --> 05:51.267
with his tongue.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.436
Who leaves their fiancée
six days before a wedding?

05:53.436 --> 05:54.729
Psycho.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.856
You'll find someone else.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.566
You have to.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.818
- Think of your eggs.
- Mm.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.529
I'm here. That's all you need.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.823
You're so fucking
weird with him.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.158
It's Christmas!

06:07.575 --> 06:09.869
Do you even care
that I finished my book?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.206
Yes!

06:13.206 --> 06:16.626
Uh, yeah, of course.
Book. Good job.

06:20.546 --> 06:25.676
<i>The Unlikely Adventure
of Squid the Squirrel.</i>

06:25.676 --> 06:28.930
Y-You told me to send it
to you when I was finished, so.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.433
I had a feeling about you.

06:32.433 --> 06:33.976
You, you liked it?

06:34.519 --> 06:36.437
I did have an illustrator

06:36.437 --> 06:39.190
I wanted to recommend,
if you're open.

06:40.316 --> 06:43.194
His name is Mr. McGooch.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.278
Stop.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.781
- Really?!
- The journey of your character:

06:46.781 --> 06:49.367
is she a squid or a squirrel?

06:49.617 --> 06:51.661
And then, in the end,
of course, you reveal...

06:51.661 --> 06:53.621
she's neither. She's...

06:53.621 --> 06:56.374
she's complicated,
like the best characters are.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.334
Yes! See, I,
I knew you would get it.

06:58.334 --> 07:02.672
But... is she also,
maybe, a little... gross?

07:03.381 --> 07:05.591
Tentacles all over her body.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.051
She's a monster?

07:07.051 --> 07:10.805
Oh, well, y-y--
Uh, yes, uh, but-- and no.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.099
She-- The--
See, she feels like a monster

07:13.099 --> 07:14.767
because she's different,
you know?

07:14.767 --> 07:17.437
But, but I, I think she
could be adorable.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.232
I don't mean to be immodest,
but even with my talent,

07:21.232 --> 07:24.444
I have no idea how to make
the grotesque mutant

07:24.444 --> 07:27.155
you have written,
in any way, adorable.

07:29.073 --> 07:30.950
You just said
the best characters

07:30.950 --> 07:32.660
were the complicated ones.

07:33.202 --> 07:36.164
Well, there's complicated
and there's hideous.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.790
Hideous doesn't sell books.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.834
Look at <i>The Giving Tree.</i>

07:39.834 --> 07:41.461
Despicable person.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.172
Very handsome young man.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.382
These are the realities.

07:46.924 --> 07:51.554
Now... what if we forget
about the whole squid business

07:51.554 --> 07:55.141
and we give our squirrel
some freckles,

07:56.142 --> 07:58.186
and a ponytail,

07:59.854 --> 08:02.106
some cute bangs.

08:02.565 --> 08:07.111
And, um, w-what, what happens
if I don't wanna change it?

08:09.780 --> 08:11.407
Your prerogative entirely.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.660
You'll just have to find
another illustrator.

08:17.705 --> 08:18.706
Think about it.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.792
Oh.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.753
I'm so sorry.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.423
Tell me when you
have a decision.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.760
Jimenez.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.640
- Oh, Mr. Waltham.
We need to talk.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.266
Is everything okay?

08:37.266 --> 08:38.392
Sit down.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.605
We have identified
the source of the data breach.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.565
It's Kevin.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.110
Kevin leaked
clients' personal information?

08:48.236 --> 08:49.529
Not exactly.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.572
The hackers installed
malware in the bank's system

08:51.572 --> 08:53.783
via the deluge of
pornographic films

08:53.783 --> 08:55.576
Kevin downloaded
off of the internet.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.245
Oh.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.499
That's, um-- I can't even--

09:01.666 --> 09:03.292
Kevin is denying everything.

09:04.126 --> 09:08.256
And if... I'm being honest,
I'm inclined to believe him.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.508
There's no way that kid
is bright enough

09:10.508 --> 09:12.093
to take down a network firewall.

09:12.426 --> 09:13.469
So...

09:15.888 --> 09:17.640
is there something you'd
like to tell me?

09:23.020 --> 09:25.314
Oh shit.
What the hell is this?

09:27.316 --> 09:28.776
What did you tell him?

09:28.776 --> 09:30.736
I didn't say anything.
The fire alarm went off.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.531
That was me.
I was buying us time.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.575
He left for the day for the
cattle feed IPO road show.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.410
Well, now he just wants
to meet with me

09:37.410 --> 09:38.494
first thing tomorrow morning.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.454
He's gonna know it was me, Kevin.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.539
He probably already does.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.416
I mean, it's true.
You were the one

09:43.416 --> 09:44.792
who took down the firewall.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.960
Because you and
Chad asked me to!

09:45.960 --> 09:47.211
What, what, what I'm saying is,

09:47.211 --> 09:48.504
no one's hands are clean here.

09:49.005 --> 09:52.258
Look... Chad is Dick's son.
He's protected no matter what.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.135
Which leaves you and me.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.805
I can't go down for this...
I have a family.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.224
You do?

10:00.349 --> 10:03.102
Yeah, man...
Melissa and the twins?

10:03.102 --> 10:04.687
You never even mention them.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.356
Well, why would I? The point is,

10:07.356 --> 10:09.317
we could both lose
everything here.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.193
We need a united front.

10:11.193 --> 10:12.820
Yeah, okay.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.739
Aside from the three of us,

10:15.865 --> 10:17.533
who's the only other witness?

10:19.535 --> 10:20.536
Chris.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.290
He's not one of us...
You know that.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.877
He biffed the Pringles deal.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.253
His own lead.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.005
He has no future at
the bank as it is.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.965
Either he loses the job now
or six months from now.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.091
It doesn't matter.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.136
It matters to him.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.764
I thought you had
what it takes for this job.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.016
- I do.
- Then that settles it.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.229
- ♪

10:59.909 --> 11:03.329
Whoa, it's... it's big.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.793
Yeah... it's technically
a junior one-bedroom,

11:08.793 --> 11:10.419
but pretty good size.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.838
And you're back in the, uh--

11:13.464 --> 11:15.216
Junior one closet?

11:15.216 --> 11:17.218
Um,

11:17.760 --> 11:19.762
- I finished my book.
Wow.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.639
I'd love to read it.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.974
When you're ready to let me.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.434
You really don't have to.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.061
I would like to.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.405
I think I may have even found
a publisher.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.949
I mean, they... have notes,
you know,

11:39.949 --> 11:41.909
but, uh, a-all publishers do.

11:41.909 --> 11:45.079
- What are the notes?
- Well, they think my

11:45.705 --> 11:47.790
main character is sort of...

11:48.541 --> 11:49.583
ugly?

11:49.583 --> 11:51.168
But it's, it's not a big deal.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.963
And it's a really great opportunity.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.215
Hm... how'd you land that?

11:57.425 --> 11:59.051
Through Ted.

11:59.677 --> 12:00.678
McGooch.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.388
It would be under his imprint.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.391
What a guy.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.768
(scoffs) Right... okay.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.438
So, you said you had
something for me.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.859
My dad found these in my room.

12:20.781 --> 12:21.824
My slippers?

12:22.283 --> 12:25.536
That's why you called me?
Is to give me back my slippers?

12:25.536 --> 12:27.913
Actually, I wanted to get
your advice on something,

12:27.913 --> 12:30.166
but I'm not sure
I really trust your judgment.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.250
Wow.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.795
And here I thought you were
calling to maybe,

12:34.795 --> 12:36.630
I don't know, apologize.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.424
And what would I be
apologizing for?

12:38.424 --> 12:41.510
How about the fact that you
fucking cheated on me, Miguel?!

12:41.677 --> 12:42.762
- I explained this to you!

12:42.762 --> 12:44.513
- Fiona came to me--
- Yeah. No, right, sorry.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.682
- She kissed you.
- Oh, too bad you were stuck in Vermont

12:46.682 --> 12:48.392
returning your wedding dress
to your fiancée.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.895
Because remember,
you were engaged,

12:50.895 --> 12:52.855
which you somehow forgot
to mention to me

12:52.855 --> 12:54.190
in the five months
we were dating.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.066
Yeah, I guess
it's kind of like how you

12:56.066 --> 12:57.193
forgot to mention to me

12:57.193 --> 12:58.569
that you were almost engaged

12:58.569 --> 13:00.780
to the woman that you
cheated on me with!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.615
- That's a pretty big difference!

13:02.615 --> 13:05.159
-  Jesus, Yogurt. No! Stop!
- Hey, Yogurt!

13:05.159 --> 13:06.327
Ow, fuck!

13:06.327 --> 13:08.370
- Hey, shh.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.122
- It's okay.
Jesus Christ.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.832
- It's okay. You're okay.
- No, it's fine. I'm fine.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.584
- I just--
- You're okay, you're okay.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.254
You're telling <i>him</i> it's okay?

13:17.254 --> 13:18.881
He's scared.
He doesn't like people yelling.

13:18.881 --> 13:19.965
It freaks him out.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.884
He just fucking bit me, Miguel!

13:21.884 --> 13:23.719
- With his teeth.
- Are you okay?

13:23.719 --> 13:25.262
Oh my god.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.722
You know, I don't know
what it is with you

13:26.722 --> 13:28.599
and your fucking psycho dog.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.393
There's nothing with me
and my psycho dog. He's old.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.646
'Kay, well, you two
deserve each other.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.899
Oh, and by the way,
congrats on the apartment.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.984
I hear it has great amenities!

14:06.053 --> 14:07.680
What are you doing?
Put that down.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.014
Do not read that.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.516
Hey, listen to me.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.143
Your career is on the
line here, okay?

14:13.143 --> 14:15.271
Your future is on the line.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.731
We got a young man's
life to destroy!

14:18.566 --> 14:21.193
In a good way.
Of course.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.822
Are you ignoring me?

14:25.948 --> 14:26.991
Hey!

14:26.991 --> 14:29.034
Hey, asshole.
Listen to me...

14:30.077 --> 14:31.328
I'm your best friend.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.207
I'm your
best friend, man.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.128
What the hell is going on?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.006
I've been waiting 20 minutes.
We said 8:30.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.011
I did it.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.514
All of it.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.821
Let me guess,
your dad found more slippers.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.365
I don't know what
kind of changes

15:08.365 --> 15:10.117
the publishers are
telling you to make,

15:10.117 --> 15:12.828
and it's...
it's none of my business,

15:16.624 --> 15:17.708
but don't,

15:18.250 --> 15:19.501
don't change anything.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.379
Everyone tells Squid
she's different.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.675
Everyone tells her she
doesn't belong.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.803
All those voices...
the way they stay with her,

15:30.346 --> 15:32.306
floating in her head,
following her,

15:32.306 --> 15:34.975
saying "no" to her
in a million different ways,

15:34.975 --> 15:37.436
until <i>she...</i> finally

15:38.687 --> 15:39.772
says "no" back.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.484
Whoever told you Squid was ugly,

15:44.485 --> 15:45.945
they don't see what I do.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.643
Hi.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.062
Thank you so much for coming.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.355
I was in the area.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.400
My latex wholesaler
is just around the block.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.735
For my New Year's suit.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.820
Right.

16:27.987 --> 16:28.988
Um,

16:29.780 --> 16:31.824
so I've made my decision,

16:32.491 --> 16:37.162
and I realize this could be
a life-changing opportunity.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.831
Absolutely.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.583
But... the thing is,

16:42.251 --> 16:46.005
my life has already
changed so much,

16:46.005 --> 16:48.507
which is exactly what I wanted.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.719
I wanted to change
everything about myself.

16:51.719 --> 16:55.472
And I've listened
to so many different people

16:55.472 --> 16:57.683
telling me who I should be.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.935
Kinda like... Squid.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.105
Yeah, I listened to roommates,

17:03.105 --> 17:06.066
and essayists,
and writing teachers,

17:06.066 --> 17:12.072
and marionette puppeteers
slash drug dealers, and... you.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.242
And I finally realized

17:16.702 --> 17:20.706
I don't wanna be
somebody else... anymore.

17:22.124 --> 17:25.961
And I don't want... Squid
to be anybody else either.

17:27.379 --> 17:30.382
Maybe she is ugly.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.011
Maybe nobody'll like her.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.930
But she is who she is.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.850
I can't change that.

17:41.518 --> 17:42.519
Okay.

17:43.937 --> 17:46.940
So, uh... what's the plan?

17:47.691 --> 17:50.611
Pound the pavement?
Cold call publishers?

17:50.611 --> 17:53.781
I guess I'm... betting on me.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.494
How very New York of you.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.918
- Happy New Year.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.963
Hey.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.507
What are you doin'?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.383
Everybody's askin'
where you are.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.344
I was tryin' to figure out

18:15.344 --> 18:18.472
how much of my furniture
I could fit in here.

18:19.389 --> 18:22.351
I may have to move back in, temporarily.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.644
I, um,

18:25.187 --> 18:26.438
I got fired.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.941
Oh, Mig.

18:32.736 --> 18:33.737
What happened?

18:34.196 --> 18:37.491
Uh, it's... it's complicated.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.785
Um... but

18:40.828 --> 18:42.037
it's fine.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.747
I'm fine.

18:44.665 --> 18:45.916
Which is funny.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.543
I've spent my whole life

18:47.543 --> 18:50.003
scared of losing things.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.588
And now, I've lost...

18:52.381 --> 18:54.091
pretty much everything.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.552
My job, Lindsay and--

18:56.552 --> 19:00.430
I-I still don't understand
what happened... with Lindsay.

19:00.430 --> 19:03.308
- Everything seemed great and then--

19:03.308 --> 19:04.893
It turned out,
we didn't know each other

19:04.893 --> 19:06.103
as well as we thought we did.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.439
There were things she
didn't tell me.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.359
Things I didn't tell her.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.778
Have you talked at all?

19:14.778 --> 19:18.073
She came over the other night
to get her slippers,

19:19.158 --> 19:21.618
and... Yogurt bit her.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.579
I ended up--

19:24.371 --> 19:26.790
I wasn't defending Yogurt, but--

19:27.166 --> 19:28.584
- Oh boy.

19:39.094 --> 19:40.179
There was this day...

19:40.929 --> 19:42.764
a few weeks after Mom died.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.767
I came home from school, and...

19:46.518 --> 19:48.937
you were standing outside
our old house, you remember?

19:49.354 --> 19:50.731
We had that red door.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.902
<i>And you had this big
smile on your face.</i>

19:54.902 --> 19:59.114
I remember you said there was
something incredible... inside,

19:59.114 --> 20:00.949
something that I was gonna love.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.286
<i>And for a second,
I thought maybe,</i>

20:05.078 --> 20:06.413
maybe it's her

20:08.665 --> 20:09.750
behind the door.

20:11.960 --> 20:12.961
Waiting.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.715
Maybe my mom didn't die.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.428
And I opened the door, and...

20:22.554 --> 20:23.847
there was this little puppy

20:25.432 --> 20:27.017
in a cardboard box.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.436
And you said,

20:30.229 --> 20:32.731
"Diego already decided
his name is Yogurt."

20:36.443 --> 20:38.362
I guess he's not just
a dog to me.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.073
Did ya tell Lindsay that?

20:43.283 --> 20:45.285
I'm glad I didn't

20:46.536 --> 20:47.788
'cause now she's gone.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.834
You have to... let people in.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.255
Okay. And then, what if--

20:56.255 --> 20:59.091
What if... they leave?

21:00.133 --> 21:01.134
They do.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.012
What if they don't understand?

21:04.846 --> 21:05.847
They don't.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.183
What if they

21:09.059 --> 21:10.269
get sick?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.523
They might.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.692
But you can't spend
your whole life

21:16.692 --> 21:18.235
locked up in your head.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.946
You have to trust someone.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.622
I'll see you out there?

21:43.635 --> 21:45.012
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>

21:45.012 --> 21:47.681
<i>- Here we are in Times Square...</i>

21:49.349 --> 21:50.934
<i>...before the ball drops.</i>

21:50.934 --> 21:53.228
<i>It's a beautiful night
in New York City.</i>

22:46.531 --> 22:48.867
Do you really think she's
gonna be waiting for you?

22:48.867 --> 22:49.951
This is tragic.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.870
He's not going to be there, Linds.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.497
Bro, you should be
at your dad's party

22:53.497 --> 22:55.415
grindin' on that chick, Isabela.

22:55.415 --> 22:56.833
Don't care if she's
your third cousin.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.210
Even for the end of the world,

22:58.210 --> 23:00.837
you're much too puffy
to be seeing anyone else.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.381
I have a lotta things
to tell you.

25:50.465 --> 25:51.466
So much.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.719
Me too...
Oh, but y-you go first.

25:54.719 --> 25:55.804
Well,

25:56.346 --> 25:59.516
maybe not, like,
this exact... second.

26:01.309 --> 26:02.769
I love you.

26:04.813 --> 26:05.855
I love you.

26:08.149 --> 26:09.234
Have we said that yet?

26:10.443 --> 26:11.987
I was just thinking that.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.363
- I feel like we did.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.240
I'm-I'm pretty sure I said it.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.659
- You, you definitely sort of said it.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.870
Happy New Year!

26:30.964 --> 26:32.841
I guess it's a new millennium.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.218
The world didn't end.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.221
Not yet at least.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.504
Ooh.

27:12.881 --> 27:16.343
Oh my god.
I'm so sorry.

27:16.343 --> 27:20.013
-  Are you okay?
-  Yes, I've just been,

27:20.013 --> 27:22.682
I've been having such terrible
heartburn the last few weeks.

27:22.682 --> 27:25.769
And, like, also feeling
really nauseous,

27:25.769 --> 27:27.854
but also, starving to death?

27:29.689 --> 27:32.067
What have I always said?

27:32.067 --> 27:34.527
Condoms have an
efficacy rate of 98%

27:34.527 --> 27:36.905
until you account
for human error.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.114
Oh my god.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.533
No, no, no! You're still a baby!
- Oh my god.

27:40.533 --> 27:43.578
You're gonna be the worst dad.
