03:54.233 --> 03:55.167
THE OTHER ONE LOOKS LIKE SHE

03:55.167 --> 03:58.167
WANTS TO KILL YOU.

03:58.167 --> 03:59.433

15:38.267 --> 15:41.100
A SIGNAL OFF MY SHINY, SHINY

15:41.100 --> 15:44.067
SCALP THAT SAYS, "G'DAY, MATE.

15:44.067 --> 15:46.467
HAPPY TRAILS TO YOUSE."

15:49.233 --> 15:52.067
I USED TO SAIL WITH MY DOG.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.133
MY FIRST DOG WAS A

15:53.133 --> 15:54.767
GERMAN SHEPHERD NAMED DELILAH.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.367
SHE HAD BEAUTIFUL, BROWN EYES

15:56.367 --> 15:58.067
AND A TONGUE THAT DIDN'T QUIT.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.067
PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN ROAMING

16:06.067 --> 16:06.767
THE SHIP.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.567
LAST CRUISE, I WENT TO THE BACK

16:08.567 --> 16:10.433
OF THE SHIP, THE AFT, AND I FELL

16:10.433 --> 16:11.167
IN A HOLE.

16:11.167 --> 16:13.067
I WAS STUCK IN THAT AFT HOLE FOR

16:13.067 --> 16:13.867
TWO WEEKS...

16:15.600 --> 16:17.200
...UNTIL SOMEONE CAME AND FOUND

16:17.200 --> 16:18.300
ME IN THAT AFT HOLE.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.067
ALL RIGHT, YOU MISERABLE

16:22.067 --> 16:23.467
MAGGOTS, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

16:23.467 --> 16:23.833
SEA.

16:27.467 --> 16:28.933
>> HE'S THE WORST MASTER OF

16:28.933 --> 16:29.867
CEREMONIES EVER.

16:29.867 --> 16:31.433
>> I'LL BE HONEST, I DON'T DO

16:31.433 --> 16:32.567
WELL WITH GEOGRAPHY.

16:32.567 --> 16:34.067
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LAKE

16:34.067 --> 16:34.667
WE'RE ON.

16:36.900 --> 16:37.900
>> LOOK AT THIS GUY!

16:37.900 --> 16:39.067
LOOK AT THIS GUY'S FACE!

16:39.067 --> 16:41.133
>> IT'S SO NICE TO BE SURROUNDED

16:41.133 --> 16:43.167
BY MY GOOD CANADIAN BROTHERS AND

16:43.167 --> 16:44.233
SISTERS AGAIN.

16:44.233 --> 16:45.900
I SPENT WAY TOO MUCH TIME

16:45.900 --> 16:47.767
VISITING OUR UGLY NEIGHBOR TO

16:47.767 --> 16:49.767
THE SOUTH, THE UNITED STATES...

16:54.500 --> 16:56.400
...WHERE THE WOMEN ARE ROUGHER

16:56.400 --> 16:58.433
THAN THE MEN AND THE MEN HAVE NO

16:58.433 --> 16:59.133
MANNERS.

16:59.133 --> 17:01.167
KARAOKE'S MY ABSOLUTE FAVE, AND

17:01.167 --> 17:03.200
YOU CAN DO IT NOW ON DECK THREE.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.467
COME HOLLA AT ME.

17:07.467 --> 17:09.067
I'LL BE UP IN THE AFT.

17:09.067 --> 17:15.700
SINGLE BOYS SAY, "HO!"

17:19.467 --> 17:21.200
>> IT SAID ON THERE, "DROP THE

17:21.200 --> 17:21.767
MIKE!"

17:21.767 --> 17:23.267
IT SAID, "DROP THE MIKE!"

17:24.433 --> 17:25.067
OH, MAN!

17:25.067 --> 17:26.067
>> YEAH, NICE WORK.

17:26.067 --> 17:26.600
>> YES!

17:26.600 --> 17:27.600
>> GOOD DAY, SIR.

17:27.600 --> 17:28.400
>>

17:28.400 --> 17:29.833
>> CAN'T WAIT FOR MY SPEECH.

17:29.833 --> 17:30.700
>> OH, NO, NO.

17:30.700 --> 17:31.800
SPEECH -- NO SPEECH.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.400
PUT YOUR BATHING SUIT ON AND GO

17:33.400 --> 17:34.333
OUT TO THE DECK.

17:39.367 --> 17:40.567
AND NOW IT'S JOE'S TURN.

17:40.567 --> 17:41.300
>>

17:41.300 --> 17:42.733
>> YOU MIGHT SAY THAT WE SAVED

17:42.733 --> 17:43.733
THE WORST FOR LAST.

17:43.733 --> 17:45.900
>>

17:45.900 --> 17:47.667
>> SO, JOE IS ABOUT TO CRASH A

17:47.667 --> 17:49.500
CANNONBALL CONTEST ON THE SHIP,

17:49.500 --> 17:51.133
EXCEPT HE CAN ONLY DO BELLY

17:51.133 --> 17:51.700
FLOPS.

17:51.700 --> 17:52.633
>>

17:52.633 --> 17:54.400
>> AND, JOE, YOU CAN ONLY STOP

17:54.400 --> 17:56.067
WHEN WE SAY YOU CAN, BUDDY.

17:56.067 --> 17:57.467
>>

17:57.467 --> 17:58.933
>> ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO.

17:58.933 --> 17:59.733
HERE WE GO.

17:59.733 --> 18:01.067
>> HERE WE GO, PAL.

18:01.067 --> 18:01.867
>>

18:01.867 --> 18:03.100
>> UNVEIL THE BELLY!

18:03.100 --> 18:04.400
>> UNLEASH THE BEAST!

18:04.400 --> 18:05.833
>> OH, MAN. THERE IT IS.

18:05.833 --> 18:07.067
>> YEAH.

18:07.067 --> 18:07.900
>>

18:07.900 --> 18:09.267
>> LOOK AT JOE!

18:09.267 --> 18:12.467
>> GO, GO, GO!

18:12.467 --> 18:14.733
>> UH-OH.

18:14.733 --> 18:15.800
>> GO, JOE!

18:15.800 --> 18:20.900
>> JOE'S A CHICKEN!

18:20.900 --> 18:22.733
>> THERE HE GOES!

18:25.233 --> 18:28.700
>> OH! THAT WAS PAINFUL.

18:28.700 --> 18:29.667
>> OH!

18:29.667 --> 18:30.800
>> JOE, DO IT AGAIN, BUDDY.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.367
HERE WE GO.

18:33.367 --> 18:34.400
CUT THE GIRL!

18:34.400 --> 18:36.400
CUT THE LITTLE GIRL!

18:36.400 --> 18:39.600
>>

18:39.600 --> 18:42.067
>> OH!

18:42.900 --> 18:48.367
>> THE WHOLE CROWD GOES "OH!"

18:48.367 --> 18:50.200
>> OH, MY GOD.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.233
HELP.

18:51.233 --> 18:56.867
>> AGAIN, BUDDY, AGAIN.

18:58.633 --> 19:00.100
>> GOT THE CAMERA!

19:00.100 --> 19:01.800
HE GOT THE CAMERA!

19:01.800 --> 19:04.200
THE CAMERA'S LIKE 20 FEET AWAY!

19:04.200 --> 19:05.100
>> I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S JUST

19:05.100 --> 19:06.067
TRYING TO HAVE FUN WITH IT OR

19:06.067 --> 19:06.900
HE'S LOST HIS MIND AT THIS

19:06.900 --> 19:07.200
POINT.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.233
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

19:09.833 --> 19:11.067
>> LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE

19:11.067 --> 19:12.367
BETWEEN HIS BACK AND HIS FRONT.

19:12.367 --> 19:12.767
LOOK.

19:12.767 --> 19:15.433
IT'S PALE WHITE AND HOT PINK!

19:15.433 --> 19:17.200
>> I'D BE FEELING SO BAD RIGHT

19:17.200 --> 19:18.900
NOW IF THE THREE OF US DIDN'T

19:18.900 --> 19:20.567
HAVE TATTOOS ON US THAT THIS

19:20.567 --> 19:21.967
CHUMP GAVE US FOR LIFE.

19:21.967 --> 19:23.800
>> HEY, JADEN SMITH SAYS HELLO,

19:23.800 --> 19:24.500
YOU DICK.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.533
>> I THINK I'M DONE, BOYS.

19:32.533 --> 19:33.733
IT'S REALLY HURTING.

19:33.733 --> 19:35.167
>> AGAIN, AGAIN!

19:35.167 --> 19:39.133
NO MERCY, NO MERCY.

19:39.133 --> 19:40.767
>> OH!

19:40.767 --> 19:42.067
>> I JUST WANTED TO TAKE THIS

19:42.067 --> 19:43.333
OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU GUYS

19:43.333 --> 19:44.533
FOR WHAT MY PUNISHMENT WAS.

19:51.433 --> 19:53.233
>> ALL THE FERVOR AND LIFE IS

19:53.233 --> 19:55.067
BEING SUCKED OUT OF HIM.

19:55.067 --> 19:56.233
>> OH, GOD.

19:57.067 --> 19:59.167
>> HE'S EXHAUSTED.

19:59.167 --> 20:00.667
>> IF HE WAS A VIDEO GAME, THE

20:00.667 --> 20:02.100
LIFE METER WOULD BE BLINKING.

20:02.100 --> 20:06.233
>>

20:06.233 --> 20:07.533
>> LOOK AT HOW RED HE IS!

20:07.533 --> 20:08.367
>> OH, MY GOD!

20:08.367 --> 20:10.533
LOOK AT HIS STOMACH!

20:14.467 --> 20:16.467
>>  HE'S DONE.

20:16.467 --> 20:16.933
HE'S DONE.

20:16.933 --> 20:18.067
>> YEAH, WE GOT TO LET HIM OFF

20:18.067 --> 20:18.500
THE HOOK.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.100
>> HE IS DONE.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.567
>> NICE WORK, BUDDY.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.133
>> OH, MY GOD.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.600
>> NOW YOU CAN DANCE.
