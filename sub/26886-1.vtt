What seems to be the problem?

Oh, I'm just like... I'm locked
out of my account and I think...

32:22.065 --> 32:25.360
I think you guys are just, like,
replaying an old show or something.

32:25.443 --> 32:28.321
Hmm... I don't think that's possible.
We can't do that.

32:28.404 --> 32:30.990

32:31.240 --> 32:32.867
Yes, I've got it up over here.

Uh, yeah, I'm here.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.212
The show's live and the performer
matches the ID on file, so...

33:26.796 --> 33:28.673
Can you just freeze the account
or something?

33:28.756 --> 33:31.634
You can disable the account
from your model control page.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.595
I can't disable the account
because I'm locked out.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.722
So can you just...

33:36.597 --> 33:37.598
do something?

33:37.974 --> 33:40.852
Let me escalate this
up to tier two support.

33:40.935 --> 33:42.687
We'll get back to you shortly.

38:41.527 --> 38:43.946
I need to ask you to calm down.
You're acting hysterical.

-Sure.
-Thank you.

You want me in real life.
You... you love me.

-I didn't talk to you last night.

40:02.858 --> 40:04.860
Oh... Lola.

get the, uh, guacamole cheese tower.

57:39.831 --> 57:41.749
I'm just gonna stick with water.

57:41.958 --> 57:45.837

-Driving?

59:07.752 --> 59:09.337
That's a long way from Georgia.

But... you're strong.
You'll make it through.

1:11:58.397 --> 1:11:59.398
