Hey, Holly, it's getting late,
we've got to get back to my

place, get our luggage or we're
never going to make the train.

10:52.651 --> 10:54.320
Ben, how can I leave
to go on tour with you?

10:54.403 --> 10:57.865
My sister's a mess,
her marriage just fell apart.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.992
She's devastated.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.704
Actually, she doesn't look
that devastated to me.

11:10.961 --> 11:13.255
Ahem. Well,
I've done well at weddings

11:13.339 --> 11:15.549
but I've never made out
with the bride.

I hope I didn't
do anything foolish.

You mean after you made out
with the entertainment?

11:38.197 --> 11:40.658
Okay, so, Val,
what can I make you?

11:40.741 --> 11:41.951
You want some soup?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.285
'Or how about hot cocoa?'

11:43.369 --> 11:45.287
Or we could shoot peanut butter

into doughnuts.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.042
Just think.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.170
Right now I'd be lying
in Rick's arms

11:53.254 --> 11:56.048
on the pink sands of Bermuda.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.800
He'd be whispering in my ear.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.845
Aww, this is the happiest
day of my life.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.390
And I'd be whispering
in his ear..

12:04.473 --> 12:07.268
...I sure wish my sister didn't
tell me about you and Julie.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.524
What did you say?

12:13.607 --> 12:15.693
Oh, uh, you know, just that

12:15.776 --> 12:17.945
I'm so grateful
that I have a sister

12:18.028 --> 12:20.614
that loves me enough
to tell me the truth

12:20.698 --> 12:23.826

ruining my wedding.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.411
What are you trying to say?

12:25.494 --> 12:27.788
Are you not happy
that I told you about Rick?

12:27.872 --> 12:30.875
No, I love it that you ruined
the happiest day of my life.

12:30.958 --> 12:34.712
Oh, my God, you're actually
blaming <i> me</i> for this?

12:34.795 --> 12:38.132
I was saving you. I was
just doing you a huge favor.

I cannot believe that I gave up

12:55.107 --> 12:56.567
two months with my boyfriend

12:56.650 --> 12:58.694
because I was actually
worried about you.

12:58.777 --> 13:00.112
Who asked you to give it up?

13:00.196 --> 13:02.156

to see them get hurt

- Hey.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.141
I saw you leave the wedding

13:29.225 --> 13:30.392
with that Melody chick.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.977
She's gonna come out naked

13:47.451 --> 13:49.245
- What is it, man?
- Well, um..

13:49.328 --> 13:51.205
Since you and I are best friends

13:51.288 --> 13:54.708
and, um, you know,
we don't keep secrets

13:54.792 --> 13:56.085
the girl that I hooked up with

13:56.168 --> 13:59.755
was, uh...was Tina.

13:59.838 --> 14:02.883
Tina? What the hell?
I slept with Tina last night.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.177
A-ha, it's true!

Busted! How could you
go there, man?

months I've been living with'

14:09.098 --> 14:11.600
"I still love Holly,
Holly should be with me"

14:11.684 --> 14:13.269
and then you go hook up
with her best friend?

14:13.352 --> 14:15.020
I didn't mean for it
to happen.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.814
I was depressed
Holly was leaving

14:16.897 --> 14:18.649
Tina was depressed
her boss dumped her

14:18.732 --> 14:20.818
it was depression sex.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.946
Well, yeah, it was with Tina.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.782
Gary, you gotta swear to me
you can never tell Holly

14:26.865 --> 14:28.242
about this.
She'll never understand.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.911
Who would? It's the Tina!

14:33.289 --> 14:36.458
You and Tina. Naked. Oh..

14:38.002 --> 14:39.962
Do you know how many hours
of porno I'm gonna have to watch

14:40.045 --> 14:42.965
to get that image
out of my head? Oh!

14:43.048 --> 14:44.967
Gary, I'm serious.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.719
Now, I know
you're not the best at this

14:46.802 --> 14:49.054
but you have
to keep this a secret.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.016
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
I-I can keep secrets.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.976
Alright? Now, now,
did I ever tell anyone

14:54.059 --> 14:56.228
that you wrote Celine Dion
a fan letter?

14:56.312 --> 15:00.149
She's excellent, Gary,
and you told everyone!

15:00.232 --> 15:02.651
Oh, come on now, man,
you can't tell someone that

15:02.735 --> 15:04.820
and expect them
to keep it to themselves.

15:04.903 --> 15:07.615
You and Tina. Tina and you.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.575
Celine Dion.
What's the world coming to?

15:09.658 --> 15:11.869
Shut up!

15:11.952 --> 15:15.956
Please, man, just promise me
you'll never say anything.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.541
[knock on door]

15:17.625 --> 15:19.918
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
I-I promise.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.589
Hey, hey!

15:23.672 --> 15:25.758
Holly, uh, if you're looking
for Tina, Tina's not here.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.384
No one knows anything
about Tina.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.720
Did you know that Vince wrote
Tina Dion a fan letter?

15:33.223 --> 15:35.934
Ben's in the bedroom.
We're gonna go.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.479
Ben! I'm here!

15:38.562 --> 15:39.938
Hey, there.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.148
I thought I was coming
over to your place

15:41.231 --> 15:44.026
to say goodbye.
How's Val doing?

15:44.109 --> 15:47.196
She said that it was my fault
that her wedding was called off.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.656
Can you believe her?

15:48.739 --> 15:49.865
I saved her from making the

15:49.948 --> 15:51.367
biggest mistake of her life!

15:51.450 --> 15:53.202
Holly, she just needs someone
to yell at right now

15:53.285 --> 15:54.912
and, unfortunately,
you're the closest one to her.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.873
Okay, well, maybe Val and I
are a little too close.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.084
A little separation will be
the best thing for both of us.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.335
What?

16:01.418 --> 16:03.545
My bags are downstairs
with the doorman.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.297
I've got clean underpants,
Mad Libs

16:05.381 --> 16:07.508
and a pound of beef jerky.
Let's go on tour!

16:07.591 --> 16:08.801
Are you serious?
You're coming with me?

16:08.884 --> 16:10.719
Yes, I'm serious.
Come on, let's go!

16:10.803 --> 16:13.222
I've always dreamed
of seeing Newark!

16:13.305 --> 16:15.265
Holly, Holly, you're talking
really high and fast.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.975
You always do that
when you're upset.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.520
I'm fine.

16:19.603 --> 16:22.022
I'm just looking forward
to seeing New Jersey.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.484
It's got a bad rap, but it's
the garden state, you know.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.946
- Okay.
- Alright, let's book.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.407
Oh, wait did you remember to
bring my songbook from the loft?

16:31.490 --> 16:34.076
- No, I didn't know you left it.
- Oh.. Holly, I hate to ask.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.619
Do you think
you could go back and get it?

16:35.703 --> 16:37.413
I'll get the train tickets
and I'll meet you at your place?

16:37.496 --> 16:38.831
No!

16:38.914 --> 16:41.583
I'm scared to go home
to that mean old bride!

16:51.385 --> 16:54.596
If you're home, Val,
I'm not here to stay!

16:54.680 --> 16:58.016
I just came by to pick up
something that Ben left!

16:58.100 --> 16:59.268
Hope I'm not
telling you anything

16:59.351 --> 17:01.562
that's gonna ruin your life.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.829
I don't want you
to freeze to death.

17:18.912 --> 17:21.290
I'm sure that'd be
my fault, too!

17:21.373 --> 17:23.333
Thanks, but I don't want it.

17:23.416 --> 17:26.127
I want to be cold.
I wanna freeze.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.465
I wanna be numb, so I don't
ever feel anything ever again.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.468
Okay, then,
see you in two months.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.303
Don't go.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.513
- What?
- Nothing.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.392
- I need you.
- Huh?

17:40.476 --> 17:42.019
How come you heard
all the mean stuff I said

17:42.102 --> 17:43.604
under my breath,
and none of the nice stuff?

17:43.687 --> 17:47.608
I heard it, I was just
double checking because..

17:47.691 --> 17:49.693
...I couldn't believe
you still liked me.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.488
- You still like me?
- Of course. I love you.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.907
- I love you, too.
- Wanna get married?

18:00.204 --> 18:01.371
Sorry I ran out on you.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.750
Oh, you're sorry?
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.586
It's just been kind
of a rough day, you know?

18:07.669 --> 18:08.962
The stupid caterers
didn't get me

18:09.046 --> 18:11.757
the cream spinach I ordered.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.175
Should I not have told you?

18:13.258 --> 18:15.844
No. No, I'm glad you told me.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.471
If it were you,
I would've done the same thing.

18:17.554 --> 18:18.680
I know, it's a good thing

18:18.764 --> 18:20.974
we've both got big mouths, huh?

18:24.478 --> 18:26.647
Let's go inside.
It's cold out here.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.607
- Okay.
- Come on.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.527
- Help you up.
- Oh, yeah.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.028
Oh, dear.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.366
- Do it like a lady.
- Oh!

18:40.953 --> 18:43.539
You know..

18:43.622 --> 18:44.706
...the good news is

18:44.790 --> 18:47.042
not that many people
saw you in the dress.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.044
You can wear it again.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.840
You're gonna meet someone else.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.717
Someone who loves you
as much as you love him

18:55.801 --> 18:57.719
and someone
who is going to be ready.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.388
I don't know.

18:59.471 --> 19:03.058
It seems like every guy I've
ever fallen for isn't ready.

19:03.141 --> 19:06.144
Do you ever think maybe
it's because you weren't ready?

19:08.647 --> 19:10.816
When you're both ready
at the same time

19:10.899 --> 19:13.569
that's when it's right.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.905

where these pearls come from.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.701
I have a very embarrassing

19:20.784 --> 19:22.995
phone call to make
to Gavin DeGraw.

One sec.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.752
Hey, got the train tickets.
You ready to go?

19:30.836 --> 19:32.588
- Um, Ben--
- Uh, let me guess.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.631
You realized
you need to stay here because

19:34.715 --> 19:37.426
you love your sister
and she needs you right now.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.053
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.223
I'm gonna miss you so much.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.017
Oh, but, wait, I haven't
found your notebook.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.186
- Oh, it was never here.
- What?

19:48.270 --> 19:49.771
Well, you were so angry
with her.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.399
Nothing else was gonna
get you here, so..

19:52.482 --> 19:54.902
You are unbelievable.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.738
How can you be so nice to me
when I told you I was going

19:57.821 --> 20:00.824
got us all excited,
and now I'm taking it back?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.576
I'm better than you.

Okay, I got one.

all the cookie dough

20:16.048 --> 20:17.633
out of the cookie dough
ice cream?

20:17.716 --> 20:19.134
How annoying was that?

20:19.217 --> 20:21.637
But not as annoying as having
to watch "Jackass"

gonna make me feel any better.

that he waxes his back?

with the accent.
