Did you guys check

01:30.824 --> 01:34.594
followed by that sweet half-
court blast right into the net?

01:34.661 --> 01:36.362
Yeah, that was awesome, Otto.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.097
You keep shooting
like you did today

01:38.164 --> 01:40.099
and our winning streak
will never end.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.634
It sure won't.

I don't think everybody
was impressed.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.705

I do?

come and go, bro

catch one more set

07:17.436 --> 07:19.205

you today?

07:41.794 --> 07:44.497

wasn't too stressful
or anything.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.966

{\an5}Otto, I would
have loved

08:03.249 --> 08:05.518
to have been out there
today too, but, um...

08:05.585 --> 08:08.521
life is like a balance

08:08.588 --> 08:09.589
{\an1}and you need
to find the balance

between work and play

08:13.559 --> 08:15.461
{\an1}and your friends
and...

08:15.528 --> 08:17.129
family, I suppose.

08:17.196 --> 08:19.632
It's like balancing stuff.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.100
Got it?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.169
Right. Balancing stuff.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.470
Got it.

08:24.537 --> 08:25.638
Good.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.039
{\an1}And by the way,
I think your buds

08:27.106 --> 08:29.175
{\an1}left you a little present
in the kitchen.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.109

08:33.312 --> 08:34.714
Oh, man!

08:34.780 --> 08:38.650
Yep. That's all he needed--

08:38.717 --> 08:40.186
the old balance talk.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.025
Man, this is lame.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.059
Where is he?

08:47.126 --> 08:48.628
Not that I'm superstitious

08:48.694 --> 08:50.062
but I believe that
our winning streak

08:50.129 --> 08:52.698
{\an1}has a lot to do
with our rigorous

08:52.765 --> 08:54.467
pregame practice sessions.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.635
Hey, there he is!

08:55.701 --> 08:57.503
Otto, where's your gear?

08:57.570 --> 08:59.672
The game's in less
than an hour.

08:59.739 --> 09:00.706
I know.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.109
{\an1}I've just got to catch
some waves first.

09:03.175 --> 09:04.143
What?

09:04.210 --> 09:06.178
{\an1}You're going to catch
some waves now?

09:06.245 --> 09:07.079
{\an1}So you ditch us
at Mad Town

09:07.146 --> 09:09.916
you leave us hanging
at the Shack

09:09.982 --> 09:12.084
and now you're going
to bail on practice?

09:12.151 --> 09:16.122
{\an1}Yeah, bro. Why even bother
showing up for the game?

09:16.188 --> 09:17.390
What?

09:17.456 --> 09:19.325
Man, you guys are wack.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.594
Good luck winning
without me.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.362
Not that I'm superstitious

09:23.429 --> 09:25.965
but I believe our winning streak
also has a lot to do

09:26.032 --> 09:28.567
with Otto being
on the team.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.716
Me and my buds
got in a fight.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.619
I'm supposed to be playing
a hockey game right now.

09:46.686 --> 09:47.720
{\an3}Hockey?

09:47.787 --> 09:49.221
I'd be tweaked too

09:49.288 --> 09:52.224
{\an5}if my bros wanted me
to do something
lame like that.

09:52.291 --> 09:53.426
Hockey's not lame.

09:53.492 --> 09:57.496
That doesn't sound very
soul surfly of you, bro.

09:57.563 --> 10:00.366
Yeah, man, you shouldn't even
be talking about

10:00.433 --> 10:03.402
anything like that this close
to Mother Ocean.

10:03.469 --> 10:04.704

You don't skate,
you don't play hockey

10:07.773 --> 10:09.108
you don't work.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.609
Do you guys do anything
but surf?

10:10.676 --> 10:12.712
No way, dude.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.748
Surf all day
or get out of the way.

10:15.815 --> 10:18.317
But me and my friends like to do
a lot more than just surf.

10:18.384 --> 10:21.020
Maybe I had you pegged
all wrong, little bro.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.589

to choose

roller skater friends.

11:12.371 --> 11:15.041
and for just acting like
a total loser

11:15.107 --> 11:16.709
to my best buds, okay?

11:19.178 --> 11:20.413
Good enough for me.

11:20.479 --> 11:22.181
Welcome back, Rocket Boy.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.316
Welcome back.

11:24.383 --> 11:26.552
ALL:
Woogy, woogy, woogy, woogy.

11:26.619 --> 11:30.056
Now to make sure
the streak doesn't end.

11:30.122 --> 11:32.391
What?

11:34.160 --> 11:35.694
OTTO:
Aw, man!

11:35.761 --> 11:39.298
Well, you missed the first
five minutes of the game.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.699
Yeah, I don't know

11:40.766 --> 11:43.335
what you guys
would do without me.

11:43.402 --> 11:44.270
(<i> whistle blows</i> )

12:04.223 --> 12:05.991
Yeah!

12:07.226 --> 12:09.695
That's it for me, mates.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.197
They're all yours.

12:11.263 --> 12:14.867
Whoa, that dude fully rips!

12:14.934 --> 12:15.968
He totally owned that wave.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.169
Very impressive.

12:17.236 --> 12:22.007
Yeah, he's really... rad.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.611
TEACHER:
<i>Woo! All righty, class.</i>

12:25.678 --> 12:28.047
This week's science project
will be...

12:28.114 --> 12:29.949
tornado in a jar.

12:30.015 --> 12:30.950
{\an1}(<i> laughs</i> )

12:31.016 --> 12:32.051
Okay, then...

12:32.118 --> 12:34.053
(<i> door opening</i> )

12:36.956 --> 12:39.859
{\an3}Kids...

12:39.925 --> 12:41.594
this is Trent!

12:41.660 --> 12:42.962
He just moved
here <i> all</i> the way

12:43.028 --> 12:45.898
from New Zealand!

12:45.965 --> 12:47.066
The delightful island nation

12:47.133 --> 12:49.235
to our south.

12:49.301 --> 12:53.139
{\an5}Who wants to
be Trent's
science partner?

12:53.205 --> 12:54.940
GIRLS:
Me! Me! I do!

12:55.007 --> 12:56.108
{\an4}Here!

12:55.007 --> 12:56.108
Me, me, me!

12:56.175 --> 12:58.544
{\an1}But, Reggie, you and me are
always partners.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.845
I'm just trying
to be helpful.

12:59.912 --> 13:03.616
You know how hard it is
to be the new kid in school.

13:03.682 --> 13:05.050
{\an5}Oh, oh!

13:03.682 --> 13:05.050
Yeah, it looks like

13:05.117 --> 13:07.153
he's going
to have a <i> really</i> hard time.

13:07.219 --> 13:09.622
{\an5}Trish, why
don't you work
with Trent?

13:09.688 --> 13:10.356
(<i> girls sighing</i> ):
Oh!

13:10.422 --> 13:13.659
Mrs. Dunkel, you rock!

13:13.726 --> 13:15.761
Oh, I suppose I do.

13:15.828 --> 13:18.931
So, we'll get started
right after school.

13:18.998 --> 13:19.398
Okay, Reggie?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.100
{\an1}Reggie?

13:21.167 --> 13:23.235
Uh-huh.

13:30.676 --> 13:31.243
Woo!

13:31.310 --> 13:33.212
Then you zip it up

13:33.279 --> 13:34.847
{\an1}and the books stay
<i>inside</i> the backpack.

13:34.914 --> 13:37.550
Sorry, Reg.

13:37.616 --> 13:40.085
{\an5}Squid, Reggie,
race us back
to The Shack.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.788
Woo-whoo!
All right!

13:46.192 --> 13:48.994
Are you racing or what?

13:49.061 --> 13:49.728
{\an3}What?

13:49.795 --> 13:51.163
{\an4}GIRL:
You're from...

13:51.230 --> 13:52.464
Gisborne, New Zealand?

13:52.531 --> 13:55.167
That's like one of the raddest
surf spots ever.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.069
Yeah. Surfing before
I could walk.

13:57.136 --> 13:57.670
{\an1}(<i> giggling</i> ):
Ooh!

13:57.736 --> 13:59.104
That is so cool!

13:59.171 --> 14:00.472
Whoa!

14:00.539 --> 14:01.240
Whoa!

14:01.307 --> 14:02.908
Oh!

14:02.975 --> 14:03.609
(<i> whimpers</i> )

14:03.676 --> 14:05.644
Are you okay, mate?

14:05.711 --> 14:06.712
(<i> laughs</i> ):
Uh, yeah.

14:06.779 --> 14:07.846
I must have caught

14:07.913 --> 14:10.249
{\an1}a little crack in the sidewalk
or something.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.751
Or something.

14:14.119 --> 14:14.820
Thanks.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.488
(<i> laughs nervously</i> )

14:16.555 --> 14:17.189
Trent. And you are?

14:17.256 --> 14:20.559
I am, uh, uh... Reg.

14:20.626 --> 14:21.860
{\an3}That's it.

14:21.927 --> 14:24.096
Short for Regina, eh?

14:24.163 --> 14:26.131
Well, actually, it's...

14:26.198 --> 14:27.132
Cool name.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.701
I like it.

14:28.767 --> 14:29.635
You do?

14:29.702 --> 14:30.669
Thanks.

14:30.736 --> 14:32.571
ALL:
Regina?

14:32.638 --> 14:35.107
Guess I'll see you
around, Regina.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.942
Yeah. See you around...

14:37.009 --> 14:38.043
Trent.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.746
(<i> grunting</i> )

14:40.813 --> 14:41.714
{\an1}Whoa.

14:41.780 --> 14:42.715
{\an3}(<i> laughs</i> )

14:42.781 --> 14:43.849
{\an3}Regina?

14:43.916 --> 14:46.719
{\an5}You won't even
let Raymundo
call you Regina.

14:46.785 --> 14:47.786
(<i> laughs</i> )

14:47.853 --> 14:48.721
Yeah.

14:48.787 --> 14:49.355
What's up with that?

14:49.421 --> 14:51.056
Oh, I was just...

14:51.123 --> 14:53.125
being polite.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.960
Can we get started, please?

14:55.027 --> 14:56.996
Now, to simulate the tornado

14:57.062 --> 14:59.765
{\an1}we have to get the air moving
in a circular path.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.100
Up for a surf, mates?

15:01.166 --> 15:03.235
{\an1}Always.

15:03.302 --> 15:06.939
{\an5}Hacky-sack, hey?

15:03.302 --> 15:06.939
Yes, hacky-sack.

15:07.006 --> 15:08.140
I used to play that
when I was a kid.

15:08.207 --> 15:10.009
Don't play anymore, though.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.878
Yeah, me neither.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.013
Hacky-sack is <i> so</i> nine years ago.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.482
Oh, hey!

15:16.548 --> 15:17.483
Let's rock, Trent.

15:17.549 --> 15:20.219
Those waves are calling my name.

15:20.286 --> 15:20.819
{\an3}Later.

15:20.886 --> 15:22.888
Much.

15:22.955 --> 15:24.690
Finally, some peace and quiet.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.758
Time for a surf break.

15:25.824 --> 15:28.594
We've only been
working five minutes.

15:28.661 --> 15:31.530
I know. I'm <i> totally</i> burnt.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.631
{\an3}Aren't you?

15:32.698 --> 15:34.767
{\an1}Let's go.

15:36.735 --> 15:38.771
Whoa!

15:38.837 --> 15:41.674
(<i> laughing and shouting</i> )

15:49.181 --> 15:52.484
Sick and twisted ride, bro.

15:52.551 --> 15:53.752
What's that?

15:53.819 --> 15:56.221
I mean, awesome.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.456
Oh, thanks.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.992
You guys are rufus as well.

16:00.059 --> 16:00.826
{\an5}Huh?

16:00.059 --> 16:00.826
Huh?

16:00.893 --> 16:02.127
{\an1}It means
you're awesome, too.

16:02.194 --> 16:05.164
{\an5}Oh, cool.

16:02.194 --> 16:05.164
Thanks.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.132
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

16:15.841 --> 16:16.775
Nice try, mate.

16:16.842 --> 16:17.743
Beginner, eh?

16:17.810 --> 16:18.744
No, actually I'm...

16:18.811 --> 16:21.080
I'd be glad to give
you some pointers.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.147
That would be great.

16:22.214 --> 16:25.250
I... I could use them.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.190
Perfect. You don't
need my help.

16:31.256 --> 16:32.558
(<i> gasps</i> )

16:33.525 --> 16:34.860
(<i> screams</i> )

16:37.730 --> 16:38.764
{\an1}That always
seems to happen.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.432
{\an1}Maybe you could help me
with my footing?

16:40.499 --> 16:43.702
Yeah, sure thing, mate.

16:43.769 --> 16:46.071
(<i> grunting</i> )

16:49.842 --> 16:51.610
{\an1}Whoa!

16:51.677 --> 16:53.212
Oh!

17:01.653 --> 17:02.855
Oh!

17:02.921 --> 17:03.989
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

17:04.056 --> 17:06.558
Reggie's totally lame.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.560
{\an1}Maybe she just went
a little crazy

17:08.627 --> 17:09.595
with the board wax

17:09.661 --> 17:11.730
{\an1}or... or maybe the sun's
in her eyes.

17:11.797 --> 17:15.000
Or maybe she's
totally lame.

17:21.673 --> 17:23.608
(<i> laughing</i> )

17:27.945 --> 17:28.680
Hip shot.

17:31.150 --> 17:34.420
{\an1}Nailed it, tore it up,
and put it to bed.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.655
Yes! We are
ripping these guys.

17:39.625 --> 17:40.893
{\an3}Yeah!

17:44.163 --> 17:45.931
Trent!

17:45.998 --> 17:47.599
Huh?

17:48.634 --> 17:49.201
{\an1}Shoot,
Reggie, shoot!

17:49.268 --> 17:52.838
(<i> grunting</i> )

17:54.907 --> 17:56.875
Reggie, that goal
was so wide open

17:56.942 --> 17:58.744
{\an1}Squid could have made
that shot.

17:58.811 --> 18:02.881
Man, first it's the beef-o-rama
fest out in the water

18:02.948 --> 18:05.584
and now you're laming up
our game.

18:05.651 --> 18:06.919
What's up with you?

18:06.985 --> 18:07.719
Chill, Otto.

18:07.786 --> 18:10.722
I'm just having an off day.

18:10.789 --> 18:11.690
It happens.

18:13.725 --> 18:16.061
It must have the same magnitude
and force as the...

18:16.128 --> 18:20.232
Are you listening to me?

18:20.299 --> 18:22.167
Hey, I have a great idea.

18:22.234 --> 18:23.135
It's about time.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.571
Let's go surfing.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.739
{\an5}It'll be much
easier to think
out in the ocean

18:27.806 --> 18:28.774
where there are no distractions.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.644
{\an3}But...

18:32.711 --> 18:34.480
What happened to you?

18:34.546 --> 18:35.113
I fell down.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.915
<i>You</i> fell down?

18:36.982 --> 18:40.085
It happens.

18:40.152 --> 18:42.788
{\an1}Am I missing
something here?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.957
Like they say,
a green pineapple

18:45.023 --> 18:46.892
{\an1}never falls from the tree
by accident.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.928
Reggie?

18:49.995 --> 18:52.598
{\an5}Nah.

18:49.995 --> 18:52.598
Nah.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.733
(<i> grunts</i> )

18:57.069 --> 18:59.838
{\an1}She's all
falling down again.

18:59.905 --> 19:01.740
She's totally out
of the zone.

19:01.807 --> 19:02.741
What's her deal?

19:02.808 --> 19:04.810
In a word-- the new guy.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.845
{\an1}Hey...

19:06.912 --> 19:08.780
that's like three words.

19:08.847 --> 19:11.550
Reggie's around
guys all the time.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.619
Why would this one
be any different?

19:17.222 --> 19:19.591
(<i> knocking</i> )

19:19.658 --> 19:20.158
Whoa!

19:20.225 --> 19:22.127
Sorry, Sam.

19:22.194 --> 19:25.597
{\an1}Don't tell me you're
going to the beach again.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.499
Okay, I won't tell you.

19:27.566 --> 19:30.569
Excuse me, Reggie,
but does tornado in jar

19:30.636 --> 19:31.403
mean anything to you?!

19:31.470 --> 19:34.039
This thing is due tomorrow!

19:34.106 --> 19:35.207
Sam, we'll...

19:35.274 --> 19:37.242
I know, we'll work later.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.016
Kicking wave.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.719
What the...?

19:47.786 --> 19:48.320
Hey, Trent...

19:48.387 --> 19:50.689
I, uh... I was

19:50.756 --> 19:52.157
just wondering, uh...

19:52.224 --> 19:54.893
do you prefer surfing
on a cloudy day

19:54.960 --> 19:56.828
or under full-on sun?

20:00.832 --> 20:02.067
Actually, I just prefer surfing.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.002
Killer wave!

20:04.069 --> 20:06.505
Come on, guys

20:06.572 --> 20:08.273
let's ten this baby.

20:08.340 --> 20:11.810
You better hang
back on this one.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.646
It's a little intense,
for a beginner.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.181
Yeah, right.

20:16.248 --> 20:17.783
"Too intense."

20:17.849 --> 20:20.752
Too intense
for Reggie?

20:20.819 --> 20:22.187
Not for Reggie

20:22.254 --> 20:24.990
but definitely for
Regina. Come on.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.059
{\an3}Yeah.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.094
I'm missing
a history-making wave.

20:29.161 --> 20:29.895
What am I doing?

20:29.962 --> 20:32.998
(<i> cheers and hollers</i> )

20:33.065 --> 20:35.867
(<i> with New Zealand accent</i> ):
Eh, will you work with me

20:35.934 --> 20:37.603
if I talk like this,
eh, matey?

20:37.669 --> 20:38.604
Matey?

20:38.670 --> 20:40.806
Sam, what are you doing?

20:40.872 --> 20:43.742
{\an1}Trying to get my science partner
to finish her project.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.644
(<i> mockingly</i> ):
But I can't do my project

20:45.711 --> 20:46.979
'cause I'm too busy
being Regina.

20:47.045 --> 20:50.182
Whoa!

20:51.216 --> 20:54.219
Oops, I fell off again.

20:54.286 --> 20:56.788
Maybe Trent will help me

20:56.855 --> 20:58.490
'cause I'm just
a beginner. Aw...

20:58.557 --> 21:00.859
{\an1}Sam, you're acting
like a kook.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.630
Oh!

21:05.597 --> 21:08.500
Ah! I can't see
what's happening!

21:08.567 --> 21:11.737
But I feel
a spin cycle coming on!

21:11.803 --> 21:13.238
{\an3}Help!

21:19.177 --> 21:22.014
(<i> grunting</i> )

21:25.350 --> 21:27.552
Hang on, Squid!

21:27.619 --> 21:28.820
(<i> grunting and yelling</i> )

21:38.664 --> 21:39.598
Thanks, Reg.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.199
Sorry I bagged on you earlier.

21:41.266 --> 21:42.000
No, you were right.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.102
I deserved it.

21:44.169 --> 21:46.972
I've been acting
like a total goon.

21:47.039 --> 21:50.042
{\an1}Come on, we got a tornado
in jar waiting for us.

21:50.108 --> 21:52.678
(<i> all cheering</i> )

21:52.744 --> 21:54.913
Pretty amazing rocket
for a beginner.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.549
Look, Trent, you got
the wrong idea about me.

21:57.616 --> 22:00.786
The truth is,
I love hacky-sack

22:00.852 --> 22:01.453
I never fall down

22:01.520 --> 22:02.754
and no one, I repeat

22:02.821 --> 22:07.259
{\an1}no one calls me Regina
and lives to tell about it

22:07.325 --> 22:09.127
<i>and</i> I'm a great surfer.

22:09.194 --> 22:10.929
I know.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.197
Uh... how did you know?

22:12.264 --> 22:14.766
I knew from the first time
you got up on your board.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.935
{\an1}No offense, mate,
you're a great surfer

22:17.002 --> 22:17.669
but a pretty bad faker.

22:17.736 --> 22:19.171
Oh, man, what a bust.

22:19.237 --> 22:21.640
(<i> awkward giggle</i> )

22:21.707 --> 22:24.076
But how come
you didn't say anything?

22:24.142 --> 22:25.043
I figured the real Reggie

22:25.110 --> 22:27.179
{\an1}was going to show up
sooner or later

22:27.245 --> 22:29.181
{\an1}but in the meantime,
hanging out with Regina

22:29.247 --> 22:29.681
wasn't too bad.

22:34.052 --> 22:35.687
Hey, a big wave!

22:37.756 --> 22:39.124
Ah, we'll work on it later.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.727
Well, what are you waiting for?

22:41.793 --> 22:42.561
Last one in the curl

22:42.627 --> 22:44.229
{\an1}is the king
of all shoobies!

22:44.296 --> 22:46.131
ALL:
Reggie's back!

22:46.198 --> 22:49.701
