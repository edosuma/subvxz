00:11.145 --> 00:12.675
* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

00:12.713 --> 00:13.753
* TAKE IT, DUDE

00:13.781 --> 00:21.721
*

00:28.162 --> 00:29.562
* ONE, TWO, GO

00:29.597 --> 00:32.267

* 1, 2, 3, 4

00:34.368 --> 00:35.568
- * GO

00:40.574 --> 00:43.284
- MICHAEL, I HAVE
THIS FANTASY.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.481
- UH-HUH.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.152
- IT'S SUNDAY MORNING,

00:46.180 --> 00:48.520
AND I'M LYING IN BED.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.119
AND I HEAR THE LITTLE THUMP OF
THE NEWSPAPER AT THE DOOR,

00:51.152 --> 00:53.222
AND THE SUN'S JUST COMING
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.664
- YEAH?
- AND IN THE DISTANCE,

00:54.688 --> 00:58.088
I HEAR THE SOUND OF SOMEONE
SINGING VERY QUIETLY

00:58.126 --> 00:59.726
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
WANT TO WAKE ME UP.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.560
- WELL, THAT'S CONSIDERATE,
I THINK.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.366
- AND, AS I LOOK
ACROSS THE ROOM,

01:05.399 --> 01:08.469
I SEE, THROUGH THE FROSTED
GLASS OF THE SHOWER,

01:08.502 --> 01:10.442
THE SHAPE...

01:10.471 --> 01:13.711
OF THE GUY THAT I LOVE.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.341
- AM I CONDITIONING MY HAIR
AT THE TIME?

01:15.376 --> 01:16.436
- I'M BEING SERIOUS, MICHAEL.
- I KNOW.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.507
I'M SORRY.
IT SOUNDS NICE.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.175
- IT IS NICE.
IT CAN BE NICE.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.583
IT WILL BE NICE
WHEN YOU MOVE IN WITH ME.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.745
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
X-MEN IS OUT ON DVD.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.354
- [sighs]

01:27.421 --> 01:29.361
YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ME
AN ANSWER YET.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.820
- I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.488
- AND?
- WELL...

01:33.527 --> 01:34.597
IT'S A BIG STEP.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.328
- WATCH OUT FOR THE DOG POOP.
- HEH.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.204
- YES, IT'S A BIG STEP.
OF COURSE IT'S A BIG STEP.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.332
AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT
PRESSURE ON YOU,

01:39.367 --> 01:41.437
BUT I BELIEVE THAT WHEN
SOMEBODY KNOWS WHAT THEY WANT,

01:41.469 --> 01:43.269
THEY'VE GOT TO GO AFTER IT.

01:43.304 --> 01:47.744
I WANT YOU TO BE
COMING OUT OF THAT SHOWER,

01:47.775 --> 01:50.775
AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO RUN OUT.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.477
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE THAT TOO?

01:55.516 --> 01:56.846
- WELL, SURE.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.824
- SO WHEN DO I GET
AN ANSWER?

01:58.852 --> 02:01.162
- SOON.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.219
I PROMISE.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.587
ARE WE STILL ON
FOR BRUNCH TOMORROW?

02:05.626 --> 02:06.656
- I CAN HARDLY WAIT.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.464
- MM.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.600
- DAVID?
- YEAH?

02:14.635 --> 02:17.705
- NOBODY'S EVER PUT ME
IN A FANTASY BEFORE.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.638
- THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT.

02:21.742 --> 02:22.542
[engine starts]

02:22.576 --> 02:24.276
- [scoffs]
BYE.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.382
- DON'T THEY HAVE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL BABY?

02:26.414 --> 02:27.654
- HI!
- HI, LINZ.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.951
- HI.
- SECOND MOST BEAUTIFUL.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.393
MMM-MWAH.
MMM...

02:33.421 --> 02:35.261
- DID YOU KNOW HE'S
A STAY-AT-HOME DAD?

02:35.289 --> 02:37.389
- REALLY? SO WHO PAYS
FOR THE PAMPERS?

02:37.425 --> 02:38.555
- SHE DOES.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.692
SOMETHING WITH STOCKS
AND THE INTERNET.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.328
- COME ON, HURRY UP.
WE'RE GOING.

02:42.363 --> 02:45.533
- ANYWAY, I WAS JUST THINKING.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.926
I'D LIKE TO STAY AT HOME.

02:46.967 --> 02:47.797
- WELL, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.495
- WE CAN ORDER IN
KUNG-PAO CHICKEN,

02:49.537 --> 02:50.667
RENT TERMS OF ENDEARMENT.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.444
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.543
- [laughs]

02:54.575 --> 02:56.935
WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB?

02:56.977 --> 02:58.947
- DO YOU THINK ANYONE EVER
LOOKED BACK ON THEIR LIFE

02:58.979 --> 03:00.909
AND SAID, "GEE...
I WISH I HADN'T

03:00.948 --> 03:03.248
TAKEN THAT YEAR OFF
TO BE WITH THE BABY"?

03:03.284 --> 03:06.594
- BUT I THOUGHT
WE HAD A PLAN, A GOOD PLAN.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.360
AFTER YOUR MATERNITY LEAVE
IS UP

03:08.389 --> 03:11.429
AND WE GET A NANNY...
- A NANNY. I KNOW, I KNOW.

03:11.459 --> 03:14.559
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
I'D BE IN LOVE LIKE THIS.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.725
- HMM.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.795
[sighs] LOOK,
I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY

03:19.833 --> 03:20.973
FOR YOU TO STAY AT HOME,

03:21.001 --> 03:22.701
AND I THINK IT'D BE
WONDERFUL FOR GUS

03:22.736 --> 03:24.266
TO HAVE ONE OF HIS MOMMIES
WITH HIM.

03:24.305 --> 03:27.875
BUT WE HAVE TO BE PRACTICAL.
- MONEY.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.908
- UNLESS YOU HAVE A SOLUTION.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.984
- BRIAN?

03:33.013 --> 03:34.783
IT WAS JUST A SUGGESTION.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.015
- AFTER WHAT HE DID?

03:37.050 --> 03:39.650
- JUST REMEMBER, WE WOULDN'T
HAVE GUS WITHOUT HIM.

03:39.687 --> 03:44.557
- AND EVERY TIME I LOOK AT HIM,
KISS HIM, HOLD HIM,

03:44.592 --> 03:47.362
I REALIZE I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO RIGHTS.

03:47.395 --> 03:50.455
- YOU'RE STILL HIS PARENT,
EVERY BIT AS MUCH AS I AM.

03:50.498 --> 03:53.998
- NOT EVERY BIT.
BRIAN TOOK THAT AWAY FROM ME.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.704
I HAVE NO MORE CLAIMS
TO OUR SON

03:55.736 --> 03:57.936
THAN IF I WERE
A TOTAL STRANGER.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.910
- [sighs]

04:01.942 --> 04:03.412
[door closes]

04:03.444 --> 04:06.554
- OH, MY GOD!
HE LIVES HERE?

04:06.580 --> 04:09.320
- NOW I DO TOO.
ISN'T THAT COOL?

04:09.350 --> 04:12.550
CHECK OUT THE TV.
AND THE DVDs.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.016
[clears throat]
THE FURNITURE IS ALL ITALIAN.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.055
MILAN.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.560
OOH! WAIT TILL YOU SEE
THE PAINTING OF THE NAKED GUY.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.971
- OHH.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.298
OH, MY GOD.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.702
- JUSTIN, UH...

04:29.737 --> 04:31.037
A WORD.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.382
- HMM?

04:36.410 --> 04:37.610
- WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
OUT THERE?

04:37.645 --> 04:39.745
- I WAS JUST GIVING MY FRIEND
DAPHNE A TOUR.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.650
- THIS IS NOT THE WHITE HOUSE!
- OW.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.052
- GEORGE WASHINGTON NEVER
SLEPT HERE.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.323
- HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO HASN'T.

04:46.654 --> 04:49.664
- WOULD YOU PLEASE
JUST KEEP IT DOWN?

04:49.690 --> 04:50.920
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT TIME IT IS?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.928
- IT'S NOON.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.500
- OH, SHIT.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.898
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET
MY NEW TRAINER AT 1:00. FUCK!

05:02.636 --> 05:05.566
- YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO BE MORE CONSIDERATE, DAPH.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.036
- DO EITHER ONE OF YOU
KNOW HOW TO MAKE

05:07.074 --> 05:08.984
A CREATINE AND SOY SHAKE?

05:09.009 --> 05:11.349
- [snickering]
NO.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.749
- WOULD YOU PLEASE
JUST POUR ME SOME GUAVA JUICE?

05:19.587 --> 05:23.417
- HMM.
- OH. HERE IT IS.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.687
SO ARE YOU GOING HOME TODAY?

05:24.725 --> 05:25.985
- WHAT FOR?

05:26.026 --> 05:28.496
- WELL, I SAW THE BALLOONS
ON THE MAILBOX.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.599
- OH, SHIT.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.701
MOLLY'S BIRTHDAY.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.003
UH, YEAH,
BUT HOW CAN I GO BACK NOW?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.135
- SHE'S YOUR LITTLE SISTER.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.970
I'M SURE SHE MISSES YOU.
- YEAH.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.936
SHE'S PROBABLY APPROPRIATED
ALL MY COOLEST STUFF.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.035
- HERE'S YOUR DRINK, BRIAN.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.883
- YOU'LL MAKE
AN EXCELLENT WIFE.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.715
AND THEN SHE CAN DROP YOU.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.120
- PLEASE.
I'M NEVER GETTING MARRIED.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.722
I MEAN, WHY BE TIED DOWN?

05:53.754 --> 05:58.134
- I LOVE THIS GIRL.
SO...

05:58.158 --> 06:01.658
I'M GOING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:01.695 --> 06:04.595
- MMM, GONNA SMOKE SOME WEED,
DOWNLOAD PORN.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.102
- MM-HMM.
WELL, IF YOU GO OUT,

06:06.133 --> 06:08.043
BE SURE AND SET THE ALARM.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.907
BYE, DARLING.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.649
- OH, MY GOD.
[door clatters shut]

06:17.678 --> 06:20.448
HE'S TO DIE FOR.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.719
- [sniffling]

06:23.751 --> 06:25.521
HONEY, I...

06:25.553 --> 06:27.153
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

06:27.187 --> 06:30.417
WHEN--WHEN DID HE ASK?
- LAST WEEK.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.858
- LAST WEEK?
LAST WEEK?

06:32.893 --> 06:33.893
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.697
- I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.859
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.597
- WHA-WHAT'S TO DECIDE?

06:38.632 --> 06:39.802
THE MAN OF YOUR DREAMS

06:39.833 --> 06:40.973
WANTS YOU TO MOVE IN
WITH HIM.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.101
WHA...

06:42.135 --> 06:44.565
- I DON'T KNOW
IF WE'RE READY.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.835
WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER
VERY WELL, AND...

06:46.874 --> 06:47.944
- PLEASE. THERE'S PLENTY
OF TIME FOR THAT

06:47.975 --> 06:49.775
ONCE YOU'RE LIVING
TOGETHER.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.650
- WHAT ABOUT MY STUFF?
MY COMICS AND--

06:52.680 --> 06:55.650
AND MY ROBOTS
AND CAPTAIN ASTRO?

06:55.683 --> 06:56.923
- FUCK CAPTAIN ASTRO.

06:56.950 --> 07:00.590
YOU'VE GOT DR. DAVID.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.961
- THIS IS STILL MY HOME.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.159
- THIS DUMP?

07:04.191 --> 07:07.901
HONEY, YOU WON'T LOOK BACK.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.998
WELL, AND WHAT ABOUT
YOU GUYS?

07:10.030 --> 07:13.600
IF I'M LIVING WITH SOMEONE,
I-I WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.704
- OF COURSE YOU WILL.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.505
I, FOR ONE, EXPECT
TO BE INVITED

07:17.538 --> 07:21.908
TO FABULOUS DINNER PARTIES
AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.042
- [sighs]

07:27.715 --> 07:29.645
- THIS IS ABOUT WHAT A CERTAIN
SOMEONE IS GOING TO SAY,

07:29.683 --> 07:31.993
ISN'T IT?

07:32.019 --> 07:35.819
WELL, I SAY THAT YOU
DESERVE TO BE LOVED.

07:35.856 --> 07:38.726
AND DON'T LET ANY MAN,
QUEEN,

07:38.759 --> 07:42.829
OR BRIAN
TELL YOU OTHERWISE.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.203
- THANKS, EM.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.735
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:54.241 --> 07:57.751
NOW, THERE'S
JUST ONE OTHER THING.

07:57.778 --> 07:58.948
WHAT ABOUT ME?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.179
HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO
PAY THE RENT ON THIS PLACE

08:01.214 --> 08:02.554
ALL BY MYSELF?
[laughing]

08:02.583 --> 08:04.593
ROTTEN BASTARD.
- WHOA. OHH!

08:04.618 --> 08:07.088
[children playing]

08:07.120 --> 08:08.820
- OKAY, GET READY
FOR THE COUNT OF THREE.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.986
ONE, TWO, THREE...
- MAKE A WISH!

08:11.024 --> 08:12.234
MAKE A WISH!

08:12.259 --> 08:16.729
[laughter and cheers]

08:16.764 --> 08:18.034
- YOU'RE GOING TO GET
YOUR WISH.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.030
- JENNIFER...

08:24.738 --> 08:27.878
SWEETHEART.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.708
YOU CAME.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.614
I COULDN'T MISS MOLLY'S
BIRTHDAY.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.106
WHERE'S DAD?

08:34.147 --> 08:35.917
UH, HE'S UPSTAIRS
WATCHING THE GAME.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.279
KIDS' PARTIES AREN'T
EXACTLY HIS THING.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.847
- [scoffs]
- MOLLY.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.046
- JUSTIN!

08:40.087 --> 08:41.857
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOLLUSK.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.318
- WHAT YOU GONNA GIVE ME?

08:43.356 --> 08:45.556
- PERMISSION TO LIVE.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.893
HERE.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.297
JUSTIN, THIS IS
BEAUTIFUL.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.314
HEY? OKAY,
GO GET SOME CAKE.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.981
SHE'S THRILLED YOU CAME.
- YEAH?

09:03.010 --> 09:04.910
HOW COULD YOU TELL?

09:04.945 --> 09:07.245
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
ARE YOU EATING?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.050
- DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M STARVING?

09:09.082 --> 09:12.052
- WELL, YOU ARE STAYING
FOR DINNER?

09:12.085 --> 09:13.885
- THAT DEPENDS IF DAD
WANTS TO SEE ME.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.291
- OF COURSE HE WANTS
TO SEE YOU.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.363
HE'S AS UPSET ABOUT THIS
AS YOU ARE.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.791
- REALLY?

09:19.827 --> 09:22.197
- HE WANTS YOU
TO COME HOME,

09:22.229 --> 09:23.999
AS YOU KNOW I DO.

09:24.031 --> 09:27.371
- WELL...I WANT
TO COME HOME TOO.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.100
- [sighs]

09:29.136 --> 09:31.736
GOD, JUSTIN.

09:31.772 --> 09:35.712
I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR YOU
SAY THAT.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.243
LET'S GO TELL HIM.
- WAIT.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.677
WHAT ABOUT THE RULES?

09:40.714 --> 09:42.724
- WHICH RULES?

09:42.750 --> 09:44.820
- THAT I CAN'T GO OUT
OR SEE BRIAN,

09:44.852 --> 09:48.662
OR TALK ABOUT MY
"DISGUSTING LIFESTYLE."

09:48.689 --> 09:51.119
- I DON'T--I DON'T THINK
HE MEANT IT QUITE THAT WAY.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.988
- WELL, WHAT DID HE MEAN?

09:54.027 --> 09:59.667
- I THINK HE JUST WANTS
EVERYTHING TO BE AS IT WAS.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.000
- WELL, IT CAN'T BE
THE WAY IT WAS.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.304
I'M NOT THE WAY I WAS.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.006
- AND I--I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE ANYTHING OTHER

10:05.038 --> 10:07.878
THAN WHO YOU ARE,
I JUST...

10:09.943 --> 10:14.213
I HAVE TO CONSIDER
THE NEEDS OF THIS WHOLE FAMILY,

10:14.247 --> 10:16.747
NOT JUST YOUR DESIRES.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.120
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.056
- MOM.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.332
MOM?

10:34.735 --> 10:35.995
- LET'S GET THAT CAKE CUT.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.436
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.010
[laughter]
THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING.

10:39.039 --> 10:42.009
[overlapping chatter]

10:42.042 --> 10:44.442
- THE FIRST PIECE.
YOU LIKE THE FLOWER, RIGHT?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.347
YEAH.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.449
[overlapping chatter]

10:47.480 --> 10:48.720
- YAY!

10:50.150 --> 10:53.120
[techno music]

10:53.153 --> 11:00.963
*

11:00.994 --> 11:05.774
[heavy breathing]

11:05.799 --> 11:07.869
- OH, WOW. WHEW.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.101
- AND THAT WAS JUST
THE WARM-UP.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.166
- WOW!

11:10.203 --> 11:12.343
- NOW WE DO
SOME SERIOUS PUMPING,

11:12.372 --> 11:15.782
FOCUSING ON
EACH MUSCLE GROUP.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.909
AND PLENTY OF REPS.

11:17.945 --> 11:22.045
[phone beeping off the hook]

11:22.082 --> 11:24.422
WHAT THE FUCK?

11:24.451 --> 11:27.151
JESUS, I THOUGHT
I TOLD THAT KID...

11:30.490 --> 11:32.330
MY FUCKING TELEVISION'S
GONE.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.259
AND MY COMPUTER.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.834
OH, FUCK!
MY FILES.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.934
THEY EVEN STOLE
MY FUCKING CLOTHES!

11:38.966 --> 11:44.496
*

11:44.537 --> 11:48.477
- AT LEAST THE BED'S
STILL HERE.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.908
- YOU HAD ANY STRANGERS
IN THE HOUSE RECENTLY?

11:51.945 --> 11:59.885
*

12:04.557 --> 12:06.357
- UH, NO. JUST, UH...

12:06.393 --> 12:08.433
FAMILY AND CLOSE FRIENDS.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.531
SO YOU WANT ME
TO PICK YOU UP

12:09.562 --> 12:11.032
OR DO YOU WANT
TO MEET ME AT WOODY'S?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.134
- [on phone]
FUCK WOODY'S.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.865
I'VE BEEN ROBBED.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.001
GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.837
[car tires screech]

12:23.143 --> 12:25.153
- HOLY SHIT!

12:28.048 --> 12:31.018
- FORGOT TO SET THE ALARM?

12:31.051 --> 12:34.121
- I TH--I THOUGHT I DID.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.294
- THOUGHT YOU DID?
WELL, YOU DIDN'T.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.063
WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU GO?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.061
- MY SISTER'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.003
AND THEN I KINDA
WALKED AROUND.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.170
- WELL, WHILE YOU WERE "KINDA"
WALKING AROUND

12:45.198 --> 12:47.368
I GOT "KINDA" ROBBED.
- JUST TAKE IT EASY.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.340
- WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S ALL
THERE'S LEFT TO TAKE.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.170
- LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO DO IT.

12:52.205 --> 12:55.105
I'M SO SORRY.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.442
- I TOLD YOU, WHEN I SAID
YOU COULD STAY HERE,

12:57.477 --> 12:59.847
THERE ARE RULES.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.220
NOW YOU'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES
TO PACK YOUR SHIT,

13:02.249 --> 13:04.889
NONE OF WHICH, OF COURSE,
WAS STOLEN,

13:04.918 --> 13:09.418
AND GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE!

13:18.498 --> 13:20.328
- BRIAN GOT ROBBED.

13:20.367 --> 13:24.297
- WELL, BRIAN SHOULD MOVE
TO A SAFER NEIGHBORHOOD.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.467
- LIKE THIS.
I LEAVE MY DOOR UNLOCKED,

13:26.506 --> 13:28.376
NOTHING EVER GETS TAKEN.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.138
- NOT MANY THIEVES ARE LOOKING
FOR A VELVET MATADOR PAINTING

13:31.178 --> 13:33.278
AND A CONSOLE TV SET
FROM 1968, MOM.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.053
- [chuckling]
- THOSE THINGS HAPPEN TO BE

13:35.082 --> 13:37.182
VERY COLLECTABLE
THESE DAYS.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.047
- SO DO THEY HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO DID IT?

13:39.086 --> 13:42.086
- NO, BUT BRIAN
SURE IS PISSED AT JUSTIN.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.622
- POOR SUNSHINE.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.856
- HERE, HAVE SOME PANCAKES.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.063
- CAN'T. I HAVE A BRUNCH.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.064
- A BRUNCH?
MY, AREN'T WE FANCY?

13:50.097 --> 13:52.627
- IT'S THE SAME THING
AS BREAKFAST...

13:52.665 --> 13:54.495
EXCEPT WITH SOME KIWI FRUIT
ON THE SIDE.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.474
- ARE YOU GOING WITH DAVID,
MY CHIROPRACTOR-IN-LAW?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.144
- DON'T YOU START TOO.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.172
- START WHAT?
ALL I DID WAS ASK.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.208
- NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'LL BE WANTING TO KNOW

14:03.243 --> 14:05.183
IF WE'RE GONNA MOVE IN
TOGETHER.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.252
- WAIT A MINUTE.
BACK UP.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.181
HE ASKED YOU?

14:13.620 --> 14:16.390
- YES, HE ASKED.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.433
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?

14:18.458 --> 14:21.258
HE ASKED YOU?

14:21.294 --> 14:24.104
OH, MICHAEL!
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

14:24.131 --> 14:25.501
- CONGRATULATIONS, MIKEY.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.402
- OH! I'VE GOT SOME BEAUTIFUL
HEIRLOOM PIECES

14:27.434 --> 14:29.044
THAT YOUR GRANDMOTHER
GAVE ME.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.399
I'VE BEEN SAVING THEM UP
JUST FOR YOU.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.137
DON'T DRAG OUT
THE CANDLESTICKS YET.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.442
I DIDN'T SAY YES.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.314
- WELL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

14:36.343 --> 14:38.213
- WELL, I SAID
I'D THINK ABOUT IT.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.145
- WHAT'S TO THINK ABOUT?

14:40.180 --> 14:41.650
- PLENTY.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.151
I REMEMBER IT TOOK ROBERTO
AND ME SIX MONTHS

14:44.184 --> 14:47.424
TO FINALLY DECIDE
TO LIVE TOGETHER.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.994
AND A WEEK TO BREAK UP.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.462
- WELL, HOW DID YOU KNOW
HE WAS STILL SEEING

14:50.490 --> 14:52.030
THREE OF HIS EX-ES?

14:52.059 --> 14:53.189
AND WHY DO YOU HAVE TO FILL
THE KID'S HEAD

14:53.226 --> 14:54.926
WITH HORROR STORIES?

14:54.962 --> 14:56.402
- I'M JUST SAYING
IT'S NOT SO EASY

14:56.429 --> 14:57.659
FOR TWO MEN TO BE A COUPLE.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.627
- YOU THINK IT'S EASY
FOR ANYBODY?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.007
BUT IF YOU LOVE
EACH OTHER,

15:06.039 --> 15:09.639
YOU AT LEAST OWE IT
TO YOURSELVES TO TRY.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.422
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO MAKE BRUNCH.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.419
- BRUNCH IS SERVED.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.051
- I BROUGHT BRUNCH.

15:20.087 --> 15:23.457
- 12 ARMANI SUITS,
4 GUCCI BELTS,

15:23.490 --> 15:26.660
AND 6 PAIRS OF PRADA SHOES,
GONE.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.025
YOU KNOW I'M STARTING
TO SUSPECT GAY-ON-GAY CRIME.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.434
- WELL, I WOULDN'T
BE SURPRISED.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.665
YOU HAVE MORE VISITORS
THAN DISNEY WORLD.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.101
I CAN'T FIND A KNIFE
FOR THE CREAM CHEESE.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.167
- YEAH?
WELL, THEY STOLE THAT TOO.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.636
- THEY STOLE YOUR CUTLERY?

15:40.673 --> 15:41.673
- EVEN MY JUICER.
I MEAN...

15:41.708 --> 15:44.438
WHO THE FUCK STEALS
A PHILIPPE STARCK JUICER?

15:44.477 --> 15:48.547
- A THIRSTY THIEF
WITH GOOD TASTE?

15:48.581 --> 15:49.521
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
COULD COOK.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.419
- MM. SOMEDAY I'M GONNA
MAKE SOME LUCKY MAN

15:52.452 --> 15:54.022
THE PERFECT WIFE.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.264
- [chuckles] I USED TO SAY
THE SAME THING.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.329
- OH, BUT INSTEAD YOU'VE MADE
SOMEONE THE PERFECT HUSBAND.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.529
MMM!

16:00.560 --> 16:03.330
- THESE DAYS YOU BOYS ARE
SO CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT YOU EAT.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.673
ALL THOSE EGG WHITES
AND PROTEIN BARS.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.669
- I SUSPECT IT'S LESS TO DO
WITH HEALTH

16:08.701 --> 16:12.471
AND MORE ABOUT KEEPING THOSE
29-INCH WAISTS.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.605
- OH, COME ON. YOU GUYS
ARE IN GREAT SHAPE.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.581
- MM, WE TRY TO STAY ACTIVE.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.280
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.482
- [chuckles]

16:20.513 --> 16:22.623
- WELL, I HOPE THEY FIND
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.249
- I KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.394
THAT LITTLE ASSHOLE WHO FORGOT
TO SET MY ALARM.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.359
- OHH, AS IF YOU
NEVER FORGOT ANYTHING.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.058
- NOTHING THAT IMPORTANT.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.761
- YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT LINDSAY
TO BE HAPPY.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.262
THAT'S ALL I'VE EVER WANTED.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.734
- I THINK IT'S GREAT
THAT SHE WANTS TO STAY HOME

16:35.762 --> 16:37.362
WITH THE BABY, BUT...

16:37.397 --> 16:38.497
ON YOUR SALARY ALONE,

16:38.531 --> 16:40.631
I JUST DON'T SEE
HOW WE CAN MAKE IT WORK.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.497
- [sighs]

16:41.534 --> 16:44.374
MAYBE IF I TOOK
ON A BIGGER CASE LOAD.

16:44.404 --> 16:47.774
OR, UM, WHAT IF WE REDUCED
OUR EXPENSES?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.637
- MM. IT'S GOING TO BE
KIND OF TOUGH

16:49.676 --> 16:52.376
WITH ANOTHER MOUTH
TO FEED.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.052
- THESE TWO MET
IN WORLD WAR II.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.281
WE SERVED ON A WARSHIP.
THE "YORKTOWN."

16:56.316 --> 16:59.046
- TALK ABOUT
YOUR GAY CRUISE.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.286
- THERE WAS THIS PLACE
BEHIND THE AMMO BAY

17:01.321 --> 17:02.761
WHERE YOU COULD GET
A BLOW JOB

17:02.789 --> 17:04.689
ANY TIME, DAY OR NIGHT.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.763
[all laugh]

17:06.792 --> 17:08.403
THIS WAS WARTIME.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.258
YOU COULD DIE AT ANY MOMENT.

17:10.297 --> 17:14.666
- AND SEX WAS HOW YOU KNEW
YOU WERE STILL ALIVE.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.570
- I KNOW YOU MAY NOT WANT
TO HEAR THIS,

17:16.603 --> 17:19.073
CONSIDERING HE WOULDN'T
GIVE YOU PARENTAL RIGHTS,

17:19.106 --> 17:20.406
BUT, UH...
- NO, I TOLD LINDSAY,

17:20.440 --> 17:22.410
BRIAN IS NOT THE SOLUTION
TO OUR PROBLEMS.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.712
HE'S THE CAUSE. AND HE CAN
KEEP HIS GODDAMN MONEY.

17:25.744 --> 17:29.545
- WELL, THEN THERE'S ONLY
ONE OTHER POSSIBILITY.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.750
- SO WHERE IS HE?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.357
- WHO?
- JUSTIN.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.489
- I DON'T KNOW!

17:38.525 --> 17:42.555
I TOLD HIM TO PACK HIS SHIT
AND GET THE HELL OUT.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.495
- YOU WANT ME TO USE MY
INHERITANCE MY FATHER GAVE ME?

17:45.532 --> 17:47.232
- WELL, IF IT'S THAT
IMPORTANT TO YOU

17:47.267 --> 17:51.397
TO HAVE LINDSAY STAY HOME
WITH THE BABY.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.308
[chuckles]
IT'S JUST THAT THAT...

17:53.340 --> 17:55.140
THAT'S MY NEST-EGG.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.505
IT'S ALL I HAVE IN CASE
SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.114
I KNOW.
IT'S A TOUGH CALL.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.277
AND, BELIEVE ME, IF THERE
WAS ANY OTHER WAY,

18:02.315 --> 18:06.785
BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE THAT
WE HAVE ANY OTHER OPTIONS.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.889
- [chuckles] WE JUST
CAME BACK FROM BORA BORA.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.161
- YEAH?
- WENT THERE ON OUR 50TH.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.331
- 50TH?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.330
- ANNIVERSARY.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.732
- HOLY SHIT!

18:16.763 --> 18:19.333
- YEAH! IT AMAZES ME TOO!
[laughs]

18:19.366 --> 18:20.796
- [forced laugh]

18:27.374 --> 18:29.614
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'VE BEEN
TOGETHER FOR SO LONG.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.742
- WELL, THAT'S WHY
I WANTED YOU TO MEET THEM,

18:30.777 --> 18:33.307
TO SEE IT'S POSSIBLE
FOR TWO MEN

18:33.346 --> 18:35.316
TO SHARE A LIFE TOGETHER.

18:35.348 --> 18:38.788
IT'S WHAT I'D LIKE
FOR US.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.748
- ARE YOU TWO PLANNING
TO LIVE TOGETHER?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.487
- MICHAEL HASN'T
DECIDED YET.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.392
BUT I'M HOPING.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.485
- WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?

18:46.526 --> 18:48.756
- I GET NERVOUS ON CRUISES.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.355
I GET SEASICK CROSSING
THE SUSQUEHANNA, SO...

18:51.398 --> 18:53.428
[laughter]
- LISTEN, YOUNG MAN,

18:53.466 --> 18:55.436
LIVING TOGETHER
AIN'T FOR SISSIES.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.268
- NEITHER IS GROWING OLD.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.774
- AND NO MATTER
WHAT THE PROBLEMS,

18:58.805 --> 19:00.505
THE SACRIFICES,
IT'S WORTH IT.

19:00.540 --> 19:05.810
HAVING SOMEONE BESIDE YOU
WHO SHARES YOUR LIFE...

19:05.845 --> 19:07.805
- AND YOU ARE THERE
TO SHARE HIS.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.248
- YOU SENT HIM AWAY?
- LOOK, I DID HIM A FAVOR,

19:13.286 --> 19:14.646
AND THIS IS HOW
HE REPAYS ME.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.417
- HE DIDN'T DO IT
ON PURPOSE.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.926
- WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP
MAKING EXCUSES FOR HIM?

19:18.958 --> 19:20.288
- [scoffs]
SORRY.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.557
MUST BE A FORCE OF HABIT.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.825
COME ON, HONEY.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.674
- HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

19:26.699 --> 19:28.469
- IT'S TIME FOR GUS'S BRUNCH.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.671
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO
HELP ME WITH THIS LIST.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.943
- OH, YEAH. THERE'S ONE VALUABLE
ITEM THAT'S MISSING

19:32.972 --> 19:34.512
THAT CAN'T BE REPLACED.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.511
[pen scratching]

19:37.544 --> 19:39.254
[caps pen]

19:46.353 --> 19:48.523
- YOU'RE SUCH A BIG,
DRAMATIC QUEEN.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.885
- IT'S "DRAMA QUEEN,"

19:49.922 --> 19:51.422
AND DO YOU HAVE
A BETTER IDEA?

19:51.458 --> 19:52.688
- YOU COULD STAY AT MY HOUSE.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.895
- YEAH, I'M SURE YOUR PARENTS
WOULD LOVE THAT.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.428
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
IN NEW YORK?

19:58.465 --> 20:00.495
- MODEL?
- YOU'RE SKINNY ENOUGH.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.503
YOU HAVE, LIKE, THE WORLD'S
MOST-PERFECT HAIR.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.395
- OR I COULD BE A GO-GO BOY.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.837
I'VE SEEN 'EM AT BABYLON.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.312
I COULD MAKE, LIKE,
100 BUCKS A NIGHT.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.711
- MAYBE I COULD
COME WITH YOU.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.712
I CAN SHAKE IT UP TOO!
- [laughs] THAT'D BE GREAT.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.714
YOU AND ME!

20:13.746 --> 20:15.316
- EXCEPT...

20:15.348 --> 20:17.878
I HAVE TO BE HOME BY 11:00.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.887
- WELL...I'M GOING.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.856
LOOK AT THIS.

20:26.893 --> 20:30.363
IT'S A CONFIRMATION NUMBER.
I CHARGED A TICKET.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.797
- SINCE WHEN DO YOU HAVE
A CREDIT CARD?

20:31.831 --> 20:33.631
- I TOOK BRIAN'S.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.736
- THAT'S LIKE A MAJOR FELONY
OR SOMETHING.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.638
YOU COULD GO TO JAIL
FOR THAT.

20:37.670 --> 20:40.040
- LEAST I'D HAVE
A PLACE TO LIVE.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.342
BESIDES, I'M GONNA
PAY HIM BACK

20:41.374 --> 20:43.644
AS SOON AS I GET A JOB.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.376
I JUST GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.

20:45.412 --> 20:48.012
NOW.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.917
- 50 YEARS?

20:49.949 --> 20:52.619
[scoffs]
- POOR SUCKERS.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.492
- DO YOU THINK
THEY STILL DO IT?

20:54.521 --> 20:56.961
- AT THEIR AGE,
IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.589
- YEAH, IT'S ABOUT
LIFE SUPPORT.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.656
YOU KNOW, IT JUST SO HAPPENS
A PERSON CAN HAVE

21:00.693 --> 21:02.603
AN ACTIVE SEX LIFE
AT ANY AGE.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.029
- WELL, THAT MEANS THERE'S
STILL HOPE FOR YOU.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.574
- SO WHEN ARE YOU
AND THE DOC

21:06.599 --> 21:08.369
GOING TO START MASSAGING
EACH OTHER'S PROSTATES?

21:08.401 --> 21:09.771
- WOULD YOU GIVE HIM
A BREAK?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.842
- HE'S HAVING ENOUGH TROUBLE
DECIDING.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.911
- THEN WHY NOT CONSULT
MYSTERIOUS MARILYN?

21:14.941 --> 21:16.441
WHAT'LL IT BE, BOYS?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.876
PALMS? TAROT?
SPIN AROUND THE OUIJA?

21:18.911 --> 21:20.051
ONLY 20 BUCKS.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.049
- [scoffs]

21:24.384 --> 21:26.594
- ALL RIGHT.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.019
10, AND NOT A PESO MORE.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.355
- MYSTERIOUS MARILYN SENSES
YOU'RE AN ACCOUNTANT.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.891
- OH, SHE'S GOOD.

21:32.925 --> 21:36.895
- YOU, THE ONE
WITH THE BOYFRIEND, SIT.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.029
PUT YOUR DIGITS ON THE OUIJA,
SWEETHEART.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.695
[inhales deeply]

21:40.733 --> 21:43.903
OUIJA, WHAT
IS HIS TRUE LOVE'S NAME?

21:46.373 --> 21:48.813
"B"...

21:48.841 --> 21:50.611
"R"...

21:50.643 --> 21:52.483
"I"...
- OH, THIS IS TOO WEIRD.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.082
- THAT IS NOT MY BOYFRIEND'S
NAME.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.683
- THAT WASN'T THE QUESTION.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.075
AND, FRANKLY,
HE'S A BAD BET.

21:58.117 --> 22:01.817
NOW LET'S ASK
ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.364
- HEY!

22:03.390 --> 22:04.620
JUSTIN'S RUN AWAY.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.525
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- HE WENT TO NEW YORK!

22:08.561 --> 22:10.531
- WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD.
- WHAT?

22:10.563 --> 22:13.403
- UM...HE TOOK
YOUR CREDIT CARD.

22:13.433 --> 22:14.673
- THAT LITTLE FUCK!

22:14.701 --> 22:17.141
- HE'S GOING TO BECOME A GO-GO
BOY IN CHELSEA.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.069
AND HE'S GOING TO BE
VERY SUCCESSFUL.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.905
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

22:20.940 --> 22:22.380
- GOD WRITES THE SCRIPT,
SWEETIE,

22:22.409 --> 22:24.609
I JUST SAY THE LINES.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.519
- YOU BETTER FIND HIM
AND BRING HIM BACK.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.519
- I SEE YOU ON
THE PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE.

22:31.551 --> 22:32.651
- YEAH, THE FUCK YOU DO.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.515
- AND BEFORE YOU LEAVE,

22:33.553 --> 22:36.963
BE SURE TO CHECK THE AIR
IN YOUR TIRES.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.389
- THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

22:39.426 --> 22:40.386
OW!

22:40.427 --> 22:42.997
- THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!

22:43.029 --> 22:45.399
[upbeat music playing]

22:45.432 --> 22:47.002
- SINCE WHEN IS HE
MY RESPONSIBILITY?

22:47.033 --> 22:49.003
- SINCE YOU TOOK HIM HOME
AND FUCKED HIM!

22:49.035 --> 22:51.035
- MA, PLEASE.
- WELL, THAT'S THE TRUTH.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.140
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOTTEN AWAY
WITH A LOT,

22:53.172 --> 22:55.112
MORE THAN YOU SHOULD,
BUT NOT THIS TIME.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.811
NOW, YOU'RE GOING
TO NEW YORK.

22:56.843 --> 22:57.883
- THE FUCK I AM.

22:57.910 --> 22:58.850
- AND YOU'RE
BRINGING SUNSHINE HOME

22:58.878 --> 23:01.508
IN EXACTLY THE CONDITION
WHICH YOU FOUND HIM.

23:01.548 --> 23:02.918
OTHERWISE IT'S NOT HIS
PARENTS OR THE POLICE

23:02.949 --> 23:04.019
YOU'RE GONNA ANSWER TO,
HONEY.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.180
YOU'RE GONNA ANSWER
TO ME.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.647
- WHY DO YOU CARE?

23:06.686 --> 23:07.986
- 'CAUSE I COULDN'T
LIVE WITH MYSELF

23:08.020 --> 23:08.960
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO THAT KID.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.758
I LOVE HIM LIKE MY SON.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.660
HELL, YOU'RE ALL MY SONS.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.962
- THANK YOU, ARTHUR MILLER.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.125
LOOK, I MEAN NEW YORK'S
A PRETTY BIG PLACE.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.774
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO FIND HIM?

23:19.799 --> 23:21.569
- DAPHNE SAID
HE'D BE IN CHELSEA.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.641
- I'M NOT GOING TO NEW YORK.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.641
- LOOK, I'LL GO WITH YOU.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.013
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR WORK?

23:28.040 --> 23:29.580
- I CAN MISS A DAY.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.909
- SEE? YOU NEVER HAVE TO ASK
THIS KID FOR ANYTHING.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.984
- WELL, AS LONG
AS THE BACKSEAT'S EMPTY,

23:34.013 --> 23:35.623
I GUESS I MIGHT AS WELL
BE IN IT.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.048
- YEAH, YEAH!
COUNT ME IN.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.793
- WHY DO YOU GUYS
WANT TO GO?

23:38.818 --> 23:40.188
- "WH-WHY"?

23:40.219 --> 23:42.659
WHY?

23:42.689 --> 23:44.789
- HOW CAN YOU EVEN ASK THAT?

23:44.824 --> 23:46.594
- BRIAN, YOU'RE ONE OF OUR
CLOSEST FRIENDS.

23:46.626 --> 23:47.926
- I CAN'T LET YOU GO OFF ON THIS
PERILOUS JOURNEY

23:47.960 --> 23:48.830
ALL ON YOUR OWN!

23:48.861 --> 23:51.061
- WE ARE GONNA BE WITH YOU
ALL THE WAY.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.727
- I'M REALLY TOUCHED.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.536
WHAT'S THE REAL REASON?

23:57.937 --> 24:00.037
both: ROAD TRIP!
ROAD TRIP!

24:00.072 --> 24:02.942
ROAD TRIP!
ROAD TRIP! ROAD TRIP!

24:04.911 --> 24:07.681
WELL, IT'S--IT'S GOING TO BE
A BUMPY NIGHT,

24:07.714 --> 24:09.124
SO LET'S DO A "BUMP" AND,
UH, STAY UP.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.918
- PUT THAT SHIT AWAY.
- [sniffing]

24:11.951 --> 24:14.591
DON'T WORRY.
I'VE GOT VALIUM TO COME DOWN.

24:14.621 --> 24:17.121
- IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,
YOU'RE GOING TO GET ADDICTED.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.486
- PLEASE! I'VE BEEN
DOING THIS FOR YEARS.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.956
[zipper unzips]

24:21.994 --> 24:23.934
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT CLOTHES
TO TAKE.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.973
- JUST, UM, PACK YOUR BASIC
LITTLE BLACK DRESS.

24:25.998 --> 24:29.568
WORKS FOR ALL OCCASIONS.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.502
DAMN IT.
WHERE IS IT?

24:31.538 --> 24:32.608
- WHAT?

24:32.639 --> 24:33.969
- THE BROADWAY ALBUM.

24:34.006 --> 24:36.106
CAN'T GO TO THE BIG APPLE
WITHOUT BARBRA.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.182
[knock on door]

24:37.209 --> 24:39.249
- ROAD TRIP! ROAD TRIP!

24:39.278 --> 24:41.578
ROAD TRIP! ROAD...

24:41.614 --> 24:42.684
TRIP.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.775
- I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.847
- WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO COME ALL THE WAY OVER HERE.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.856
- OH, OF COURSE I DID.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.858
- NOW, WHAT IS THIS
ABOUT A TRIP TO NEW YORK?

24:50.890 --> 24:52.090
- IN CASE WE GO CLUBBING,
SHOULD I BRING

24:52.124 --> 24:53.894
THE BLACK LEATHER
OR THE ORANGE LEATHER?

24:53.926 --> 24:55.696
DAVID! HI!

24:55.728 --> 24:56.528
- HI, EMMETT.

24:56.563 --> 24:58.033
- WELL, HI.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.904
UM, HEY! YOU SHOULD COME
WITH US.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.932
BECAUSE AFTER SPENDING ALL
NIGHT IN BRIAN'S JEEP,

25:01.968 --> 25:03.838
BOY, WE ARE ALL
GOING TO NEED...

25:03.870 --> 25:06.270
ADJUSTMENTS.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.605
- JUSTIN RAN AWAY, SO...

25:11.644 --> 25:13.814
- YOU'VE DECIDED TO FORM
A SEARCH PARTY?

25:13.846 --> 25:16.046
- MM-HM.
EMMETT AND TED AND ME.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.182
- AND BRIAN.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.316
"THE BOYS"!

25:19.351 --> 25:21.821
WEREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO GO
TO MELANIE AND LINDSAY'S?

25:21.854 --> 25:24.624
OH, SHIT. I'M--I'M SORRY.
I FORGOT.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.227
- AH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.988
YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.970
- THANKS.

25:32.999 --> 25:36.639
- AND, UH,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW,

25:36.669 --> 25:39.809
I'VE BEEN THINKING
SERIOUSLY...

25:39.839 --> 25:42.739
VERY SERIOUSLY, ABOUT...

25:42.775 --> 25:45.775
[sighs] YOU KNOW.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.682
- LIVING TOGETHER.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.054
- RIGHT.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.151
- YOU HAVE A SAFE TRIP.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.782
WEAR YOUR SEAT BELT.
- OKAY.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.920
- BUH-BYE, EMMETT.

25:55.955 --> 26:00.825
- I KNOW, IT'S GOING TO BE
A BUMPY NIGHT.

26:16.776 --> 26:17.606
all:
* DAH-DIP, YEAH

26:17.644 --> 26:20.214
- WOULD YOU PLEASE
SHUT THE FUCK UP?

26:20.246 --> 26:21.306
- NO, NOT YOU, MA'AM.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.317
- STOP BEING
SUCH A PARTY POOP!

26:23.349 --> 26:24.919
- THIS IS NOT A PARTY.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.321
- STILL, A SONG AND A SNACK

26:26.352 --> 26:28.292
CAN TURN ANY MOMENT
INTO AN OCCASION.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.687
- SO THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY
MORE CHARGES ON MY VISA

26:33.726 --> 26:36.356
EXCEPT FOR THE FLIGHT
TO NEW YORK?

26:36.395 --> 26:40.765
AND YOU'LL LET ME KNOW
IF THERE ARE?

26:40.800 --> 26:42.370
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S SING
SOME BARBRA.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.101
- NO, I CAN'T DO BARBRA

26:44.136 --> 26:46.036
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT THE LYRICS
ON THE MONITOR.

26:46.072 --> 26:46.912
- [gasps]

26:46.939 --> 26:48.939
- REOW!
- BITCH...

26:48.975 --> 26:52.205
- IF ONE OF YOU STARTS
TO SING PEOPLE...

26:52.244 --> 26:54.054
I WILL LEAVE YOU ON THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD

26:54.080 --> 26:55.180
WITHOUT STOPPING.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.454
- HE'S NOT KIDDING.

26:56.482 --> 26:59.252
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE'VE ALREADY
TOLD ALL OUR BIG DICK STORIES.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.945
- DISCUSSED ANTI-GAY
LEGISLATION.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.857
- WHAT WE THINK OF BETTE'S
NEW SERIES.

27:02.889 --> 27:05.159
- AND LET'S SEE,
WE'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD...

27:05.191 --> 27:06.861
OH, 27 MINUTES.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.263
ONLY FIVE HOURS
LEFT TO KILL.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.034
- AND IF ANYONE CAN KILL
THEM, YOU CAN.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.333
- [whispering]
HA HA HA.

27:13.365 --> 27:16.665
- GOD, WE MUST BE OUT OF OUR
FUCKING MINDS TO DO THIS.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.743
- YOU WOULDN'T BE SAYING THAT
IF WE WERE GOING AFTER

27:18.771 --> 27:20.111
THE HOTTEST GUY
IN THE WORLD.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.439
- YEAH, THAT'S BECAUSE HE'D BE
GOING AFTER ME.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.305
- ALL RIGHT, SO HOW DO WE FIND
LITTLE BOY LOST?

27:26.345 --> 27:28.245
- MYSTERIOUS MARILYN
SAID HE'D BE IN CHELSEA.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.750
- YOU DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE THAT SHIT?

27:31.784 --> 27:34.424
- YOU KNOW, BRIAN, SOMETIMES
YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR FAITH

27:34.453 --> 27:35.923
IN A HIGHER POWER

27:35.955 --> 27:38.255
AND TRUST THAT EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO WORK OUT.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.230
[tire blows]

27:39.258 --> 27:40.088
- JESUS!

27:40.126 --> 27:43.056
[tires screeching]

27:45.497 --> 27:47.797
- RUNNING OFF TO NEW YORK.

27:47.834 --> 27:50.344
THERE'S AN ORIGINAL EXCUSE
TO CANCEL AT THE LAST MINUTE.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.469
- IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD
THING MICHAEL'S ALONG.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.044
JUST TO MAKE SURE BRIAN
DOESN'T GET DISTRACTED.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.044
- IF--IF YOU'D RATHER
I NOT STAY...

27:57.076 --> 27:59.446
- DON'T BE SILLY! SO IT'LL
BE JUST THE THREE OF US.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.248
- NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I HAD PLANNED.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.780
- AND WE ALL KNOW
WHO TO THANK

28:02.815 --> 28:04.915
FOR THINGS NOT WORKING OUT
THE WAY WE PLANNED.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.791
- HON, WOULD YOU CHECK...
- ON GUS? YEAH.

28:06.819 --> 28:09.059
- AND IF YOU COULD ON...
- CHECK ON DINNER? NO PROBLEM.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.288
DAVID, WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME WINE?

28:10.322 --> 28:11.362
- MERLOT? OR SOME...
- CHARDONNAY?

28:11.390 --> 28:13.930
- UH, CHARDONNAY.
- OOH, AND BE SURE TO USE THE...

28:13.960 --> 28:16.960
- WINE GOBLETS
YOUR AUNT ESTHER GAVE US.

28:16.996 --> 28:17.956
- YOU TWO ARE AMAZING.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.197
both: WE ARE?

28:19.231 --> 28:21.071
- YOU'RE LIKE SYNCHRONIZED
SWIMMERS.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.070
THE WAY YOU THINK TOGETHER,
MOVE TOGETHER,

28:23.102 --> 28:24.172
YOU EVEN FINISH
EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.043
- WELL, I GUESS THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENS AFTER SIX YEARS.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.072
YOU JUST...
- BECOME ONE.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.207
[both laugh]

28:29.241 --> 28:31.211
- I'D LIKE THAT
FOR MICHAEL AND ME.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.483
- IT'LL HAPPEN.
- OH, YOU TWO ARE A PERFECT FIT.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.482
- I DON'T KNOW.

28:35.514 --> 28:38.954
I MIGHT HAVE PUSHED
TOO HARD.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.845
THAT MIGHT BE WHY
HE RAN AWAY.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.387
- AH, HE'LL BE BACK.
- OH, AND BELIEVE ME,

28:42.421 --> 28:45.321
AFTER A NIGHT WITH EMMETT,
TED, AND BRIAN,

28:45.357 --> 28:47.957
YOU'LL BE LOOKING DAMN GOOD.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.364
- [laughs]

28:49.395 --> 28:50.355
CHEERS TO THAT.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.826
- CHEERS.
- CHEERS.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.234
- FUCK!

28:53.265 --> 28:56.435
- MYSTERIOUS MARILYN
WAS RIGHT.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.908
- HOORAY FOR HER.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.438
- SO NOW WHAT DO WE DO?
- WELL, I...

29:01.473 --> 29:04.483
COULD ALWAYS DISPLAY
A WELL-TURNED ANKLE.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.080
- YEAH, A LOT OF GOOD
THAT'LL DO US.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.482
OR...

29:08.514 --> 29:10.024
I CAN CHANGE A TIRE.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.849
[laughing]

29:11.884 --> 29:13.394
- YOU CANNOT CHANGE A TIRE.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.249
- I KNOW YOU ALL
JUST THINK OF ME

29:15.287 --> 29:16.887
AS THIS NELLY
RETAIL-QUEEN,

29:16.923 --> 29:18.933
BUT IT JUST SO HAPPENS,
I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS

29:18.958 --> 29:20.358
TO KNOW ANYTHING
THAT HAS TO DO

29:20.392 --> 29:21.292
WITH LUG NUTS.

29:21.327 --> 29:22.527
- OF COURSE.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.461
- NOW, LIKE
ANY GOOD MAGICIAN,

29:25.497 --> 29:27.897
I'LL NEED AN ASSISTANT
FROM THE AUDIENCE.

29:27.934 --> 29:31.274
- YOU! THE LOVELY BRUNETTE
IN THE FRONT ROW.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.913
COME WITH ME.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.537
THIS...

29:36.575 --> 29:41.005
- [chuckles]

29:41.047 --> 29:42.377
- [sighs]

29:42.414 --> 29:44.024
I ONLY HAVE ONE,

29:44.050 --> 29:45.450
FOR YOU AND ME.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.391
- EXCUSE ME.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.033
OKAY.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.359
[clatter]

29:55.594 --> 29:56.904
- [clears throat]

29:56.929 --> 29:58.229
- [inhales deeply]

30:00.266 --> 30:01.326
IT'S STRONG.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.041
- [coughing]

30:07.073 --> 30:08.813
- TOLD YOU.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.308
SO HERE WE ARE.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.346
BRIAN AND MIKEY'S
EXCELLENT ADVENTURE.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.552
- [chuckles]

30:17.583 --> 30:19.923
- HERE WE GO.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.452
- AH THIS SURE ISN'T HOW I WAS
PLANNING TO SPEND MY EVENING.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.418
- YEAH? HOW DID YOU THINK
YOU'D BE SPENDING IT?

30:24.456 --> 30:29.456
- GOING WITH DAVID TO DINNER
AT LINDSAY AND MELANIE'S.

30:29.495 --> 30:30.895
- AWW.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.600
DINNER PARTIES.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.171
COUPLES!

30:34.200 --> 30:35.430
CHRIST, MIKEY.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.467
IS THIS THE LIFE
I RAISED YOU TO LIVE?

30:37.503 --> 30:39.443
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO YOUR SENSE OF FUN

30:39.471 --> 30:41.071
AND YOUR THIRST
FOR ADVENTURE?

30:41.107 --> 30:43.407
- I'M HERE WITH YOU,
AREN'T I?

30:43.442 --> 30:48.382
STRANDED ON THE TURNPIKE.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.384
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT
I'M GOING TO MISS THE MOST.

30:50.416 --> 30:53.446
TIMES LIKE THIS,
WHEN IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

30:57.089 --> 30:59.429
BUT NOW YOU HAVE THE DOC.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.934
SO HOW BIG IS HIS DICK,
ANYWAY?

31:03.963 --> 31:06.203
- I'M NOT GOING
TO TELL YOU!

31:06.232 --> 31:08.972
- WHEN HE COMES, DOES HE RUN
TO THE SHOWER OR DOES HE...

31:09.001 --> 31:10.971
LAY THERE
AND HOLD YOU TIGHT,

31:11.003 --> 31:13.173
ALL WET AND STICKY?

31:13.205 --> 31:14.935
- HE LAYS THERE
AND HOLDS ME,

31:14.974 --> 31:17.914
ALL WET AND STICKY.

31:17.944 --> 31:20.484
- I GUESS HE DOES LOVE YOU.

31:20.512 --> 31:23.382
- I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS.

31:26.085 --> 31:28.545
- I'M GLAD YOU CAME WITH ME.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.487
- WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE
FOR EACH OTHER.

31:30.522 --> 31:32.392
- YOU MORE THAN ME.

31:32.424 --> 31:33.534
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.159
- YEAH, IT IS.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.534
I KNOW I CAN BE SHITTY TO YOU
SOMETIMES.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.073
I KNOW THAT.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.429
BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT YOU'LL ALWAYS LOVE ME,

31:42.468 --> 31:46.138
NO MATTER WHAT.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.272
- I DO.

31:47.306 --> 31:50.276
- [grunts]

31:50.309 --> 31:52.479
- I DO TOO.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.481
ALWAYS HAVE.

31:54.513 --> 31:58.523
I ALWAYS WILL.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.090
I DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD HAVE
MADE IT WITHOUT YOU.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.967
[tools clattering]

32:14.000 --> 32:15.500
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.474
WE'RE READY TO ROLL.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.137
NOW!

32:23.175 --> 32:25.535
- DAVID'S GREAT, ISN'T HE?

32:25.577 --> 32:28.177
- OH, MICHAEL'S DAMN LUCKY!

32:28.214 --> 32:30.084
LET'S JUST HOPE
HE DOESN'T BLOW IT.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.354
- WHAT'S THIS?

32:36.188 --> 32:41.728
"THIS CARD ENTITLES THE BEARER
TO ONE YEAR OFF.

32:41.760 --> 32:47.130
TO TAKE CARE OF THE WORLD'S
MOST BEAUTIFUL BABY."

32:47.166 --> 32:48.466
- I CRUNCHED THE NUMBERS.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.570
- BUT HOW?

32:49.601 --> 32:52.301
- IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.508
- I MADE IT WORK.
- OHH...

32:57.776 --> 32:59.376
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY!

32:59.411 --> 33:02.211
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY
ANYTHING.

33:16.228 --> 33:17.728
- MM.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.113
[baby crying]

33:31.677 --> 33:33.347
- [sighs]

33:33.379 --> 33:34.579
- I'M SORRY, I...

33:34.613 --> 33:36.253
- NO, IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.622
- I HAVE TO.
- I KNOW.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.250
I KNOW.

33:40.286 --> 33:42.016
[crying continues]

33:54.100 --> 33:56.500
- * THIS TOWN

33:56.535 --> 34:00.535
* HOW I LOVE THIS TOWN

34:00.572 --> 34:03.082
* THIS TOWN

34:03.109 --> 34:07.609
* HAS ALL I NEED

34:07.646 --> 34:09.815
* EVERYWHERE I TURN

34:09.848 --> 34:13.688
* THE BIRDS ARE SINGIN'

34:13.719 --> 34:14.819
- OH, MY GOD,
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

34:14.853 --> 34:16.663
SO MANY CUTE BOYS
IN YOUR LIFE?

34:16.688 --> 34:18.588
- JEEZ, IT'S LIKE A PORN-STAR
CONVENTION.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.764
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE LOOKING FOR JUSTIN.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.391
- NO, MA, WE HAVEN'T
FOUND HIM YET.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.358
WE'LL KEEP LOOKING.
- OKAY.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.426
- OKAY, YEAH.
I NEED A BREAK.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.734
WHAT SAY
WE HIT A HOMO BAR?

34:26.764 --> 34:27.795
- ALL RIGHT, UH,

34:27.833 --> 34:29.643
HOW ABOUT "THE LURE"?

34:29.668 --> 34:31.568
"LEATHER, UNIFORM, RUBBER"?

34:31.603 --> 34:33.443
- NAH. NO RUBBER.
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH RUBBER.

34:33.472 --> 34:36.681
IT ACCENTUATES MY HIPS.
- FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC.

34:36.708 --> 34:37.838
- GOOD NEWS?

34:37.876 --> 34:41.376
- SOMEONE'S BEEN USING
MY CREDIT CARD.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.583
- [laughs]

34:42.614 --> 34:44.454
- I'LL MEET YOU GUYS BACK HERE
IN AN HOUR.

34:44.483 --> 34:47.853
- * OH, NEW YORK CITY

34:47.886 --> 34:52.156
* HOW I LOVE THIS TOWN

34:52.190 --> 34:54.630
* THIS OL' TOWN

34:54.659 --> 34:56.300
- SEEMS TO ME WE'RE HEADED
THE WRONG DIRECTION.

34:56.328 --> 34:57.358
- YEAH! SOMETHING...

34:57.396 --> 34:58.596
- I THINK
SOMETHING'S TELLING ME

34:58.630 --> 35:00.830
THAT THIS THING'S
IN THIS DIRECTION.

35:00.866 --> 35:03.236
- * WHERE I TURN,
BIRDIES ARE SINGIN' *

35:03.269 --> 35:04.739
[knock on door]

35:04.770 --> 35:07.740
[woman screaming
and man cackling on TV]

35:09.241 --> 35:11.481
[pounding on door]

35:21.720 --> 35:23.220
- YOU WANNA COME IN?

35:23.255 --> 35:24.555
- AH, WHY NOT?

35:24.590 --> 35:25.660
SINCE I'M PAYING FOR IT.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.625
NEW YORK'S AMAZING.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.172
I WENT CLUBBING LAST NIGHT
TILL 6:00 IN THE MORNING.

35:33.199 --> 35:35.469
AND THE GUYS, WHEW!
THE GUYS ARE...

35:35.501 --> 35:37.901
- DID YOU REALLY THINK YOU WERE
GOING TO GET AWAY WITH THIS?

35:37.936 --> 35:39.506
- I FIGURED,
SOONER OR LATER,

35:39.538 --> 35:41.708
SOMEONE WOULD COME
AND ARREST ME.

35:41.740 --> 35:45.780
BUT I WAS HOPING THAT YOU
WOULD FIND ME FIRST.

35:45.811 --> 35:49.281
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

35:49.315 --> 35:52.175
NOW PACK YOUR SHIT,
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING BACK.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.488
- BACK?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.220
BACK TO WHAT?

35:56.255 --> 35:58.285
MY PARENTS DON'T WANT ME.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.264
YOU...DON'T WANT ME.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.492
MY LIFE'S A FUCKING MESS,
BRIAN.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.428
- YEAH, WELL, WHOSE ISN'T?

36:06.365 --> 36:08.595
BUT WE'RE GOING TO STRAIGHTEN
THAT OUT.

36:08.634 --> 36:09.474
FIRST THING
WHEN WE GET BACK,

36:09.501 --> 36:10.801
WE'RE GOING TO FIND YOU
A PLACE TO LIVE.

36:10.836 --> 36:11.666
- WHY CAN'T I LIVE WITH YOU?

36:11.703 --> 36:13.443
- BECAUSE MY PLACE
IS ONLY BIG ENOUGH

36:13.472 --> 36:15.942
FOR ONE PERSON--
THAT'S ME.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.983
NOW LISTEN UP.

36:24.015 --> 36:28.245
WE'RE GOING BACK TO GLORIOUS
PITTSBURGH,

36:28.287 --> 36:29.987
YOU'RE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.691
YOU'RE GOING TO TURN 18,

36:31.723 --> 36:33.593
AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY BACK
EVERY CENT

36:33.625 --> 36:35.985
YOU CHARGED
ON MY CREDIT CARD.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.827
- BY THE WAY,

36:37.863 --> 36:40.773
I DIDN'T GO OUT CLUBBING.

36:40.799 --> 36:44.569
I DIDN'T EVEN
LEAVE THE ROOM.

36:44.603 --> 36:47.743
- WELL, DON'T WORRY,
I WON'T TELL ANYONE.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.313
- YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.711
- YOU SHOULD GO TAKE
A SHOWER.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.012
- YEAH, PROBABLY SHOULD.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.783
I MUST STINK.
[sniffs]

36:53.812 --> 36:56.212
- YEAH.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.947
- SOUNDS LIKE
YOU HAD A ROUGH NIGHT.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.762
YOU NEED HELP?

37:21.773 --> 37:24.743
[What I'm Thinking Of]

37:24.776 --> 37:29.916
*

37:29.948 --> 37:31.518
* THE FLICKERING LIGHTS

37:31.550 --> 37:33.320
* ON ALL NIGHT

37:33.352 --> 37:35.352
* ENDLESS VIDEO SCREEN

37:35.387 --> 37:37.487
* AND IT AIN'T RIGHT

37:37.523 --> 37:38.963
* A KNOCK ON THE DOOR

39:16.154 --> 39:18.494
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE'S STAYING HERE?

39:18.524 --> 39:20.634
- I TALKED TO HIS MOM.
SHE'S ALL FOR IT.

39:20.659 --> 39:21.789
- WELL, I'M NOT!

39:21.827 --> 39:24.127
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU'RE MOVING IN WITH DAVID.

39:24.162 --> 39:25.602

39:25.631 --> 39:27.601
IT'S STILL GOT SOME
OF MY THINGS IN IT.

39:27.633 --> 39:30.073

SOME OF YOUR THINGS OUT.

THE CLOSET SPACE.

- THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.
THANKS A FUCKING LOT.

39:36.742 --> 39:37.542
- WAIT A MINUTE.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.746
BRIAN FINALLY
DID SOMETHING RIGHT.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.448
- WHY, DEB,

39:41.480 --> 39:43.920
THAT'S THE SWEETEST THING
YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.019
- DON'T PRESS YOUR LUCK.
- DON'T WORRY.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.191
I PROMISE
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

39:48.219 --> 39:52.989
- YOU BETTER, 'CAUSE I'M GOING
TO BE DOING UNSCHEDULED CHECKS.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.894
AND IF ANYTHING'S MISSING...

39:54.926 --> 39:56.756
OR DAMAGED...

39:56.795 --> 39:59.465
- WHY DON'T
YOU TWO BOYS RUN ALONG

39:59.498 --> 40:01.498
AND LET ME EXPLAIN THE RULES
OF THE HOUSE

40:01.533 --> 40:04.073
TO THE NEWEST MEMBER
OF OUR FAMILY?

40:04.102 --> 40:06.072
- MORE RULES?

40:10.208 --> 40:11.638
- STARTING WITH:

40:11.677 --> 40:15.477
NO BRINGING TRICKS HOME
AFTER MIDNIGHT.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.054
[door closes]

40:20.952 --> 40:25.192
- HEY! THE TRAVELER
RETURNS!

40:25.223 --> 40:26.793
[kiss]

40:33.264 --> 40:34.934
SO HOW WAS NEW YORK?

40:34.966 --> 40:37.166
- I--I REALLY DIDN'T
GET TO SEE MUCH OF IT.

40:37.202 --> 40:38.972
- WELL, IN A WAY,
I'M GLAD.

40:39.004 --> 40:42.514
GIVES ME THE CHANCE
TO SHOW YOU MYSELF.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.581
OH, SO, UM...

40:44.610 --> 40:49.010
CAN I, UH...
- GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT?

40:49.047 --> 40:52.077
- YOU JUST FINISHED
MY SENTENCE.

40:52.117 --> 40:55.717
- I'M SORRY.
- NO, NO. THAT'S NICE.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.064
- NICE.
- OH.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.156
- GO.

41:02.193 --> 41:04.963
- I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT...

41:04.996 --> 41:07.226
- MOVING IN.
MM-HM.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.995
- I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT
PRACTICALLY THE ENTIRE TIME.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.095
[both chuckle]

41:11.136 --> 41:13.836
- AND?

41:13.872 --> 41:16.842
- AND...

41:16.875 --> 41:21.245
I LOVE YOU.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.209
I REALLY DO.

41:27.686 --> 41:28.646
BUT...

41:33.759 --> 41:36.599
- THE ANSWER IS NO?

41:36.628 --> 41:40.068
- I'M JUST NOT READY.

41:40.098 --> 41:42.298
- OH, I-I UNDERSTAND.

41:42.333 --> 41:46.003
- YOU DO?

41:46.037 --> 41:49.977
- ALL THE EXCITEMENT
AND THE ADVENTURE OF...

41:50.008 --> 41:51.878
TAKING OFF IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT

41:51.910 --> 41:55.150
WITH YOUR FRIENDS
TO NEW YORK.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.750
BEING WITH BRIAN.

41:57.783 --> 42:00.053
THE MEMORIES.
THE HISTORY.

42:00.085 --> 42:04.185
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT.

42:04.222 --> 42:06.992
NO, ALL I HAVE
TO OFFER IS ME.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.125
US.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.200
THIS HOME.

42:15.701 --> 42:20.311
- CAN'T WE STILL
BE BOYFRIENDS?

42:20.338 --> 42:22.908
- WE COULD BE.

42:22.941 --> 42:24.541
WE...

42:27.946 --> 42:32.646
BUT I-I DON'T WANT A BOYFRIEND,
MICHAEL.

42:32.684 --> 42:35.754
I WANT A PARTNER.

42:46.097 --> 42:49.097
- [sighs]

43:05.851 --> 43:07.191
[door closes]

43:10.021 --> 43:13.221
[shower running]

43:13.258 --> 43:14.858
- MORNING, BEAUTIFUL.

43:14.893 --> 43:20.403
- I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU.
COME ON IN.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.831
- SO WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO

43:21.867 --> 43:24.237
ON THIS BEAUTIFUL
SUNDAY MORNING?

43:24.269 --> 43:26.969
- WELL, THOUGHT
WE'D MAKE BREAKFAST,

43:27.005 --> 43:29.365
AND THEN
WE'D READ THE PAPER,

43:29.407 --> 43:33.677
AND THEN WE'D SPEND THE REST OF
THE DAY IN BED.

43:33.712 --> 43:35.182
- AH.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.161
JUST WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

43:46.992 --> 43:50.102
- * NEVER MAKING UP MY MIND

43:50.128 --> 43:53.428
*

43:53.464 --> 43:57.274
* I PUSH AND PULL
IN ALL DIRECTIONS *

43:57.302 --> 43:59.772
*

43:59.805 --> 44:04.105
* NEVER SURE JUST
WHAT I'LL FIND *

44:04.142 --> 44:06.952
* MAN OUT OF TIME

44:06.978 --> 44:12.718
*

44:12.751 --> 44:16.291
* LOST ALONE, NOT MUCH HOPE

44:16.321 --> 44:19.391
*

44:19.424 --> 44:22.864
* THIS PAIN WON'T BE
FOREVER *

44:22.894 --> 44:25.764
*

44:25.797 --> 44:30.297
* CAN YOU SEE
WHO I REALLY AM *

44:30.335 --> 44:33.265
* WHO'S THAT STUPID

44:33.304 --> 44:36.884
* OR THAT CLEVER

44:36.908 --> 44:39.908
* I'M MY OWN

44:39.945 --> 44:42.845
* ENEMY

44:42.881 --> 44:46.051
* I'M MY OWN

44:46.084 --> 44:49.324
* ENEMY

44:49.354 --> 44:52.724
* I'M MY OWN

44:52.758 --> 44:55.958
* ENEMY

44:55.994 --> 44:58.804
* IN THE MIRROR

44:58.830 --> 45:03.840
* STARES AT ME

45:03.869 --> 45:07.069
* BOTH AGREE
THIS CAN'T GO ON *

45:07.105 --> 45:10.375
*

45:10.408 --> 45:14.178
* BEST IS GONE,
NOW'S THE WORST *

45:14.212 --> 45:16.822
*

45:16.848 --> 45:21.218
* IT'S ONLY A QUESTION
OF TIME *

45:21.252 --> 45:24.222
* WHO WILL LET GO

45:24.255 --> 45:27.525
* AND LET GO FIRST

45:27.558 --> 45:30.958
* I'M MY OWN

45:30.996 --> 45:33.966
* ENEMY

45:33.999 --> 45:37.169
* I'M MY OWN

45:37.202 --> 45:40.442
* ENEMY

45:40.471 --> 45:43.471
* I'M MY OWN

45:43.508 --> 45:47.108
* ENEMY

45:47.145 --> 45:48.945
* ENEMY
