00:03.600 --> 00:06.001
I thought angels were supposed
to be guardians.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.961
Fluffy wings, halos, you know, not dicks.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.281
Read the Bible.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.090
<i>Angels are warriors of God.</i>

00:13.600 --> 00:14.840
<i>I'm a soldier.</i>

00:15.480 --> 00:19.121
CROWLEY: <i>I think I know the identity
of Lucifer's newest vessel.</i>

00:19.400 --> 00:21.129
<i>I give you one Jefferson Rooney,</i>

00:21.360 --> 00:23.601
<i>President of these United States.</i>

00:23.840 --> 00:26.161
I just know you'd make an amazing father.

00:26.480 --> 00:27.606
A Nephilim has come into being.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.047
<i>- The offspring of an angel and a human.</i>
- SAM: <i>Lucifer.</i>

00:30.240 --> 00:31.571
I can't have this baby.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.849
I'm afraid I'll have to insist.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.481
What about the girl?

00:45.640 --> 00:47.051
RICK: <i>Kelly Kline.
She's a Presidential aide.</i>

00:47.200 --> 00:48.850
<i>We don't know where she went,
or if she's still alive.</i>

00:49.280 --> 00:50.327
MARY: <i>What's happening?</i>

00:50.600 --> 00:51.806
Yeah, Dean. What's up?

00:51.960 --> 00:53.724
- Billie?
- The reaper.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.601
I don't understand.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.926
SAM: We made a deal.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.649
Come midnight, a Winchester goes bye-bye.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.204
We made a pact, bound in blood.

01:06.760 --> 01:11.004
Break that, there's consequences,
on a cosmic scale.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.201
- Cass, what have you done?
- What had to be done.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.851
Yeah, you made a deal.
You made a stupid deal, and I broke it.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.524
You're welcome.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.931
Unplugging things now. Hint-hint.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.529
Yes. I'm almost finished.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.887
You don't have to beat that game
every night.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.491
I disagree.

02:12.720 --> 02:16.930
Fine, I'm gonna take this out,
the time I get back, we are closed.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.242
You leave. End of story.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.124
WOMAN: <i>You're too old for video games.</i>

02:33.560 --> 02:34.561
Oh.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.245
Were you waiting to play?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.409
Everyone deserves a turn.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.211
I'm sorry, have we met?

02:43.480 --> 02:44.561
Have we?

02:48.600 --> 02:49.806
Move out of my way.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.441
Or?

02:51.600 --> 02:53.170
Or I will move you.

02:53.480 --> 02:56.723
Really? Go ahead, try.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.007
Suit yourself.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.329
Oh, Benjamin,

03:12.200 --> 03:15.602
your little angel tricks won't work on me.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.006
Who are you?

03:49.320 --> 03:51.402
No. Don't, please!

04:00.080 --> 04:03.050
That's right. Call your friends.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.363
I've waited so long.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.840
Yeah, I was looking at that earlier.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.041
Cass has been busy, huh?

05:09.320 --> 05:12.608
Yeah, busy not finding Kelly Kline,
or her Rosemary's baby.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.089
I mean, how does a chick like this
just drop off the map?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.449
I think that's what he's trying
to figure out.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.049
Hey, you hear from Mom yet?

05:22.240 --> 05:23.366
Yeah, she called last night.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.443
Says she's got a line
on a shapeshifter in Atlanta.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.927
I said we could come help,
and she said don't bother.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.004
Apparently, she's "got it."

05:31.680 --> 05:33.091
Then she's probably got it.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.641
Yeah.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.761
Mom's good.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.447
I just think she jumped back
into this a little quick, don't you?

05:39.680 --> 05:42.160
I don't think we have the kind of mom
who's gonna stay home

05:42.360 --> 05:45.011
and make us chicken soup for dinner,
you know?

05:45.920 --> 05:47.763
- You talk to Cass yet?
- No.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.930
So, what, you're just gonna

05:50.120 --> 05:52.122
keep walking past each other
in the kitchen, not saying a word?

05:52.440 --> 05:53.441
Maybe.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.251
Look, yes, Cass killed Billie,
but he saved us,

05:56.480 --> 05:57.720
he saved Mom.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.326
How long are you gonna stay pissed?

05:59.640 --> 06:03.167
I'm not pissed that he cares about us.
You know, I'm grateful.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.441
But Billie said

06:05.600 --> 06:08.444
there would be cosmic consequences
if that deal got broken.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.045
- You have any idea what that means?
- No.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.044
Neither do I, but I'm pretty sure
it ain't jellybeans and g-strings.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.721
My point is,
Cass thought he was doing the right thing.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.128
CASTIEL: <i>I was doing the right thing.</i>

06:19.040 --> 06:20.530
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.571
Yeah? Well, I'm not so sure.
And when the other shoe drops...

06:23.720 --> 06:26.166
I'll deal with it. I have to go.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.641
- Got a lead on Kelly?
- No.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.003
- This is personal.
- Meaning what?

06:32.360 --> 06:34.647
Another angel, an old friend,
he called out for help.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.167
Oh. Good, old reliable angel radio.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.483
He was begging for help,
and then he just stopped.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.570
I need to know if he's still alive.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.282
Yeah, all right.
Well, we'll come with you.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.446
Both of you?

06:53.200 --> 06:54.247
Sure.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.801
Yeah, we can help.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.929
And make sure you don't do
anything else stupid.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.842
- All right, who wants music?
- I'm good.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.086
You're...

07:30.040 --> 07:31.166
Okay.

07:35.760 --> 07:39.128
Cass, is there anything specific
we should know about your friend?

07:45.080 --> 07:46.081
All right.

07:46.360 --> 07:50.081
Guys, you know what?
This silent treatment thing, it's silly.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.361
It's not gonna work.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.051
Whatever we're walking into, we should,

07:53.240 --> 07:55.720
you know, probably, have an actual plan.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.443
What do you wanna know?

07:59.840 --> 08:01.683
- Oh, he speaks.
- All right, enough.

08:01.840 --> 08:05.128
Cass, you said when you heard Benjamin,
he was screaming.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.646
It was...

08:07.680 --> 08:10.081
Look, Benjamin wouldn't call
for help lightly,

08:10.240 --> 08:12.322
and he wouldn't put himself
in harm's way if he could help it.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.363
Well, this Benjamin seems like
he's pretty cool.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.524
You know, like, he wouldn't make
any half-cocked, kneejerk choices.

08:17.720 --> 08:20.610
Yeah, you know what I like about him
is that he's sarcastic,

08:20.760 --> 08:22.285
but he's thoughtful

08:22.480 --> 08:24.244
- and appreciative, too.
- And what's that supposed to mean?

08:24.440 --> 08:25.601
Okay, okay, the road, road.

08:25.760 --> 08:26.921
Dude, watch the road.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.846
Got it.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.450
Anything else, Cass?

08:33.080 --> 08:34.808
Benjamin is always very careful.

08:35.360 --> 08:39.081
Long ago, he found
a powerfully devout vessel in Madrid,

08:39.240 --> 08:41.686
and her faith, it...

08:42.679 --> 08:45.126
She gave him everything.
Her trust, and her body...

08:45.280 --> 08:47.203
Wait, so Benjamin's a woman?

08:47.520 --> 08:50.000
Benjamin is an angel,
his vessel is a woman.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.209
But it's more than that.
She's not just his vessel, she's...

08:54.200 --> 08:57.204
She's his friend.

08:57.960 --> 08:58.961
Yeah.

09:00.680 --> 09:04.127
Benjamin would never put her
in unnecessary danger.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.721
Okay, well,
if this Benjamin is so careful,

09:06.880 --> 09:08.120
then what happened?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.121
I don't know.
That's what I need to find out.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.802
The police report is calling it
a stabbing.

09:36.200 --> 09:40.205
<i>Sure, yeah, that's the official story.
I mean, I was outside.</i>

09:40.400 --> 09:42.687
<i>I mean, dead woman?</i>

09:43.240 --> 09:44.685
<i>No blood? Come on.</i>

09:44.920 --> 09:46.729
And these crazy burn marks?

09:48.200 --> 09:49.770
It's a cult thing, right?

09:51.160 --> 09:53.288
- That's why the FBI is...
- Hey, get out.

09:54.640 --> 09:55.971
- What?
- Get out.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.008
He means we can take it from here. Thanks.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.405
Yup.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.045
- We'll call you when we're done.
- Dude? You all right?

10:05.360 --> 10:06.407
No.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.886
No. Benjamin and I, we fought together.
He was a gifted soldier.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.201
I don't know how
this could have happened.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.681
Got something.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.722
Looks like we had
a little angel-on-angel action.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.970
This isn't Benjamin's blade.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.121
What?

10:44.320 --> 10:45.560
Castiel.

10:48.360 --> 10:49.964
We have to go. Now.

10:52.800 --> 10:53.847
Uh...

11:07.120 --> 11:09.202
All right, who are we meeting?

11:10.320 --> 11:11.924
His name is Ishim.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.760
Before I commanded
my own flight of angels,

11:14.920 --> 11:16.888
my own battalion,
I served under him with Benjamin.

11:17.040 --> 11:20.089
- And you think he knows what's going on?
- We'll find out. You wait here.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.971
Whoa, wait. Excuse me?

11:22.240 --> 11:23.526
Ishim said to come alone.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.250
He doesn't like humans.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.203
If I plan to do anything else stupid,
I'll let you know.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.127
Mirabel.

11:44.720 --> 11:45.926
Ishim.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.327
You kept your vessels all this time.
I'm impressed.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.531
We are not careless.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.125
ISHIM: <i>But you, Castiel?</i>

11:55.480 --> 11:57.244
I liked the old you better.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.451
MIRABEL: <i>We've been waiting.</i>

11:59.800 --> 12:03.282
I suppose it does take longer
to get places now without our wings.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.849
You had a hand in that, correct?

12:09.480 --> 12:14.202
Now, Mirabel,
some angels think of Castiel as a hero.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.800
After he left us,
he had his own flight to command.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.931
Balthazar, Uriel, great soldiers.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.330
Both dead now, of course.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.969
You had a hand in that, too.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.290
So is he a hero?

12:33.600 --> 12:36.331
Is he a spanner in the works?
I don't know.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.171
I am not a hero.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.800
But sometimes doing the right thing
requires sacrifices.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.081
True.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.761
But it just always seems that

12:46.920 --> 12:49.924
it's other angels sacrificing
for your good deeds.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.368
Their wings. Their lives.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.928
Are you here to insult me
or talk about Benjamin?

12:58.960 --> 13:00.200
Can't we do both?

13:02.880 --> 13:04.848
MIRABEL:
<i>In the years since we lost our wings,</i>

13:05.120 --> 13:06.884
two others from our flight
have been murdered.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.246
Like Benjamin.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.131
We're all that's left.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.885
Why didn't I know about this?

13:12.040 --> 13:13.371
We didn't think you'd care.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.406
And you're gonna storm in

13:18.880 --> 13:22.043
right now.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.243
- Hey.
- Dean.

13:32.120 --> 13:35.203
Feel a little left out over there.
Scoot over.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.124
I said to come alone.

13:39.640 --> 13:43.440
These are my friends.
My friends who don't listen very well.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.161
SAM: <i>How you doing?</i>

13:46.400 --> 13:47.765
- I'm...
- We know who you are.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.761
Check outside to see if there are others.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.484
I only brought Sam and Dean.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.240
Far as you know.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.125
Mirabel, right?

14:31.920 --> 14:33.809
So who wants some pie?

14:36.200 --> 14:39.488
You know, when I knew Castiel,
he was a soldier.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.009
He was a warrior.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.130
He was an angel's angel.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.082
Now look how far he's fallen.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.482
<i>How about a little coffee with that sugar?</i>

14:57.120 --> 14:58.610
No wings. No home.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.442
Just a ratty old coat,
and a pair of poorly-trained monkeys.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.166
Oh, well, you can go to Hell.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.210
Dean, it's fine.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.806
No. No, it's not.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.566
Sam, this isn't about me,
it's about Benjamin.

15:11.840 --> 15:15.049
Now, that is refreshingly accurate.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.124
But since you brought a couple of
extra people to our little chitchat,

15:18.280 --> 15:19.930
we should go somewhere more private.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.084
I have a safe house nearby.

15:30.640 --> 15:31.926
I'll go get Mirabel.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.763
So nice to see you, old friend.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.565
Have some pie.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.843
Wow.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.371
Hell of a friend, Cass.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.885
Why do you let him talk to you like that?

15:50.080 --> 15:53.766
If Ishim can help me find
whoever killed Benjamin, then I have to...

15:53.920 --> 15:56.651
Okay, yeah, look,
I get that we need super dick there,

15:56.800 --> 15:58.564
but, I mean, come on.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.565
The angels that I served with
are being killed.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.087
So I will put up with lshim,
I will put up with everything else,

16:04.240 --> 16:05.844
and so will you. I have to go.

16:20.720 --> 16:21.846
Mirabel?

16:26.080 --> 16:27.445
You.

16:41.080 --> 16:45.608
You can't smite me, Ishim.
I'm not powerless anymore.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.121
But how...

16:47.400 --> 16:50.085
- No!
- Castiel, kill her!

16:55.960 --> 16:57.121
I know you.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.001
Hey!

17:01.080 --> 17:03.242
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt any human.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.845
Just let me finish what I've started.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.366
Not gonna happen, patches.

17:14.640 --> 17:15.880
I can't see.

17:16.359 --> 17:17.930
Sam? Hey.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.525
- I can't see. Did you get a plate?
- Yeah, I got it.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.807
Who the hell was that?

17:35.400 --> 17:37.801
Ishim, let me tend to your wound.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.086
I'm fine.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.568
Ishim, how is she still alive?

17:45.680 --> 17:47.569
Wait a second, you know her?

17:48.520 --> 17:49.601
Yes.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.484
You don't owe them an explanation.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.131
DEAN: Okay, hang on now.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.404
One-Eyed Willy back there wasn't trying
to kill us. She was after you.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.284
So talk, before she kicks
in the damn door.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.127
Before the Apocalypse, angels, um...

18:05.680 --> 18:07.045
Well, we rarely came to Earth.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.004
Yeah, basically never, right?

18:09.160 --> 18:10.161
Right.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.685
Except this once,

18:12.920 --> 18:16.003
many years ago, there was an anomaly.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.681
- An "anomaly"?
- They won't understand.

18:19.440 --> 18:20.487
Cass.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.521
What's going on?

18:39.000 --> 18:42.447
Castiel, are we all here?

18:42.720 --> 18:45.724
- Yes.
- Why are we even on Earth? It's so wet.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.206
Stop complaining.

18:47.360 --> 18:51.046
We're here, because one of our
fellow angels has taken a human wife.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.569
They also have a small daughter.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.843
A Nephilim? You're sure?

18:56.200 --> 18:59.682
Father has wings, mother's a primate,
and this child

19:00.560 --> 19:04.167
has a human soul mixed with angelic grace.
And that's...

19:04.360 --> 19:05.486
Dangerous.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.281
Nephilim are forbidden
by the oldest laws in Heaven.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.726
We jumped down here for a kid?

19:09.880 --> 19:11.166
FEMALE ANGEL: <i>Nephilim grow up.</i>

19:11.360 --> 19:14.569
- They grow into their power, and then...
- Entire worlds die.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.929
And so we've come to set things right.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.805
Akobel, please.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.327
Go back inside.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.646
Just...

19:57.680 --> 19:59.011
You have no business here.

19:59.520 --> 20:00.567
Me?

20:01.120 --> 20:03.202
You were sent here to observe humanity,

20:03.440 --> 20:04.646
to watch and to learn.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.485
But instead, taking up
with a filthy animal?

20:07.720 --> 20:09.131
Have you no shame?

20:10.560 --> 20:13.609
Who are you to lecture me about shame?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.564
Humans aren't animals.

20:17.440 --> 20:21.081
Most of them are good, and true, and...

20:23.640 --> 20:26.564
How could anyone know them
and not love them?

20:28.000 --> 20:31.607
- Touching. But we're not...
- I know why you're here.

20:35.640 --> 20:36.641
Castiel.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.247
Akobel, Seraphim of the Sixth Choir,

20:39.400 --> 20:42.882
you have lain with a human,
and you fathered a Nephilim.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.166
What?

20:46.080 --> 20:47.081
Continue.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.487
You have broken our most sacred oath.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.524
And the penalty is...

20:52.920 --> 20:54.081
Death.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.444
Dispose of his vessel.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.484
This next part, I'll do alone.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.729
WOMAN: No! No!

21:20.400 --> 21:22.448
<i>Stay away from my daughter!</i>

21:28.680 --> 21:29.806
Cass, you, uh...

21:30.080 --> 21:31.730
We completed a mission.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.121
Some mission.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.284
It was horrific, but it was necessary.
It was right.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.405
Well, you say so.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.841
And the woman'?
- <i>Lily Sunder.</i>

21:41.920 --> 21:44.730
She was a professor
of Apocalyptic Literature.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.690
<i>Studied angels, speaks fluent Enochian.</i>

21:50.200 --> 21:52.521
I took mercy on her by letting her live.

21:53.240 --> 21:56.369
And now she wants revenge.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.802
But, she's gotta be, what, 100 years old?

22:00.080 --> 22:01.241
No, more.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.124
Yeah, but somehow she's still kicking ass?

22:03.280 --> 22:04.566
No, not somehow.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.406
I know what she's up to.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.561
She made some kind of demonic pact.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.489
Keeps her young, keeps her strong,

22:12.360 --> 22:14.522
keeps her immune from our powers.

22:17.280 --> 22:19.931
All right. Well, we'll find her.
Me and Sam.

22:20.240 --> 22:23.210
- No, Dean...
- Cass, she doesn't care about us, okay?

22:23.440 --> 22:25.602
- She's gunning for you guys.
- Yeah, maybe we can reason with her.

22:26.280 --> 22:29.727
Uh, four dead angels indicate that,
perhaps, she is not reasonable.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.891
If she has this dark power,
it will take all of us to fight her.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.850
And I need to heal your wound.

22:37.600 --> 22:41.047
Wait a second.
Cass, her family was murdered.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.607
I mean, I know you were just
doing a job, but...

22:43.960 --> 22:45.803
Are you saying that those angels
deserved to die?

22:45.960 --> 22:47.644
- What?
- You think I deserve to die?

22:47.880 --> 22:49.962
- No, no, that's not what he's saying.
- What is he saying?

22:50.120 --> 22:51.804
I'm saying, maybe if we find her,

22:52.160 --> 22:53.924
we can explain to her that you're
different now, you know?

22:54.240 --> 22:57.084
Sam, that won't work. She won't quit.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.970
Think about it. Would you?

23:03.280 --> 23:05.965
Castiel's right. It won't work.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.801
We have to try.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.129
That's right. And we're not asking.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.560
The way you let
those simians talk to you...

24:17.080 --> 24:20.209
Castiel, when did you get so gooey?

24:24.880 --> 24:28.566
You know why we're meant to stay away
from them, humans?

24:29.960 --> 24:31.291
Hmm?

24:32.560 --> 24:35.564
It's not because
we're a danger to them.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.926
They're a danger to us. Case in point.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.971
Well, my friendship with Sam and Dean
has made me stronger.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.924
You can't really believe that.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.130
Your wound is deep. This will be painful.

24:52.480 --> 24:53.845
Oh...

25:07.880 --> 25:09.450
You sure about this address?

25:09.600 --> 25:10.647
Well, Lily's car was a rental.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.611
So I called the company, told them she was
wanted for questioning by the FBI.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.928
- They pinged the LoJack...
- You could have just said yes.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.329
Yes. So what's the plan?

25:18.480 --> 25:22.804
Well, we knock on her door, ask
her nicely not to kill any more angels.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.605
And if she says no?

25:24.840 --> 25:26.444
Then we burn that bridge
when we come to it.

25:27.720 --> 25:28.721
SAM: <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

25:29.120 --> 25:30.246
Give us a second.

25:30.600 --> 25:31.931
How did you find me?

25:33.160 --> 25:35.288
We're here to talk. That's it.
We come in peace.

25:35.640 --> 25:36.926
Just hear us out.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.009
We heard what happened to your family.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.961
- My family?
- See, Cass is our family.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.326
So we can't let you hurt him.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.922
- Let me?
- We don't wanna kill you.

25:47.480 --> 25:48.891
I don't wanna kill you.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.443
Okay, good, look, there we go. Agreed.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.721
Listen.

25:53.960 --> 25:58.045
It's not Case's fault that Heaven
has these crazy rules about Nephilim.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.930
- Your daughter.
- You think...

26:05.760 --> 26:07.330
Oh...

26:17.760 --> 26:19.205
Her name was May.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.522
<i>And she was beautiful.</i>

26:25.000 --> 26:27.048
I find that doll disturbing.

26:28.720 --> 26:32.884
Her father gave it to her. She loves it.
Let her be.

26:38.520 --> 26:39.726
I had a life,

26:41.320 --> 26:43.084
a wonderful life,

26:44.160 --> 26:45.161
until...

26:50.960 --> 26:52.530
They took everything from me.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.371
Akobel, please.

26:54.520 --> 26:55.601
Go back inside.

26:57.160 --> 27:00.004
Take May. Run.

27:06.880 --> 27:08.405
You have no business here.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.281
Mommy?

27:12.560 --> 27:15.689
It's fine, sweetheart.
Everything is going to be fine, I promise.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.609
Come on. Come on.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.850
All my life, I dreamed about angels.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.882
I studied them,
I made them my life's work,

27:30.840 --> 27:33.605
until finally,
I learned the spell to summon one.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.481
<i>Ishim.</i>

27:36.000 --> 27:37.525
<i>When I first saw him,</i>

27:37.680 --> 27:40.411
<i>it was like looking into the face
of the divine.</i>

27:41.480 --> 27:43.323
I thought he was perfect.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.721
But he is a monster.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.809
Ishim, what have you done?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.571
Oh...

27:56.760 --> 27:57.966
What have you done?

27:58.920 --> 28:00.968
I shared all of our secrets with you,

28:01.640 --> 28:04.769
taught you all of our ways
for your precious studies.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.126
I loved you.

28:12.280 --> 28:15.329
You didn't love me,
you were obsessed with me.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.766
That isn't love.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.200
I loved you!

28:25.360 --> 28:26.850
You threw me away for him.

28:27.120 --> 28:31.091
No. I never should have
let you into my life.

28:32.480 --> 28:36.007
I needed Akobel, to protect me from you.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.764
Well, that didn't work, did it?

28:37.960 --> 28:39.325
You killed him?

28:39.480 --> 28:40.641
Obviously.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.650
And now you're gonna kill me?

28:44.080 --> 28:45.161
No.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.929
You broke my heart, Lily.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.450
Now I'm going to break yours.

28:57.840 --> 29:00.411
- Ah!
- Mommy!

29:00.840 --> 29:03.650
And you are powerless to do anything.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.482
- No.
- You are powerless.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.161
No!

29:09.400 --> 29:10.401
<i>No!</i>

29:10.680 --> 29:12.603
<i>Stay away from my daughter!</i>

29:12.840 --> 29:14.763
No!

29:23.560 --> 29:25.210
I had my daughter

29:26.000 --> 29:29.925
long before I ever laid eyes on an angel.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.044
Wait, so...

29:38.240 --> 29:40.129
My daughter was human.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.889
Just...

29:53.640 --> 29:55.210
Are you buying any of this?

29:57.360 --> 29:58.600
Yeah, kind of.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.086
All right, well, we gotta make sure,
you know.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.243
I mean, Ishim's a tool, but you know what,

30:05.760 --> 30:07.046
I'm gonna call Cass.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.449
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.684
Yeah, he's not answering. Okay.

30:17.720 --> 30:18.721
Just go. I'll stay here.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.604
What, and leave you here with her?
You kidding me? She's...

30:20.760 --> 30:26.403
"She" is no threat whatsoever to humans,
and "she" can hear you.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.807
Okay.

30:31.280 --> 30:32.281
Okay.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.920
Mmm, I haven't felt this good
in a millennium.

30:45.280 --> 30:46.281
Oh, goodie.

30:46.480 --> 30:50.451
Ah, quit your whining.
You'll regain your strength soon enough.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.090
Where's my phone?

30:55.600 --> 30:58.365
You'll have to keep better track
of your things, Castiel.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.962
- SAM: Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

31:05.680 --> 31:08.968
I get wanting revenge, I really do,

31:09.120 --> 31:12.090
but why wait so long?

31:12.680 --> 31:14.648
I had no choice.

31:15.360 --> 31:18.569
Before the angels fell,
before they lost their wings,

31:19.240 --> 31:21.641
there would have been
no way to hunt them down.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.601
But, now...

31:26.040 --> 31:27.724
Patience is a talent.

31:28.640 --> 31:32.804
You'd be amazed what a person can do
with a little bit of purpose,

31:33.920 --> 31:35.524
and an abundance of time.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.170
You know, Ishim said
you made some kind of pact.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.051
That you're using dark magic.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.486
Did he?

31:56.800 --> 32:01.488
I've studied angels all my very long life.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.570
I use their magic.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.927
To fight. To hear them.

32:07.640 --> 32:08.687
To stay alive.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.047
Enochian magic.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.443
That's possible?

32:14.360 --> 32:17.170
It is, if you're willing
to pay the price of admission.

32:19.520 --> 32:23.525
Every time I use one of their spells,
a piece of my soul burns away.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.361
And once it's gone...

32:26.640 --> 32:28.165
<i>You won't feel anything anymore.</i>

32:28.680 --> 32:32.366
You won't care about anything anymore.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.488
You won't be human anymore.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.851
I used to dream
about my daughter every night.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.970
You know what I dream about now?

32:46.120 --> 32:47.565
Nothing.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.767
You don't trust me, I understand.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.049
But when your brother confronts lshim,

32:57.400 --> 32:59.243
the angel will kill him.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.325
Ishim's a big man in Heaven.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.721
He's got too much to lose
if the truth comes out.

33:07.880 --> 33:10.804
And when your brother's dead,
you won't stand in my way anymore.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.081
You'll help me.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.249
And for that, I can wait.

33:25.560 --> 33:26.686
DEAN: <i>Cass!</i>

33:27.680 --> 33:29.762
Hey. You okay?

33:30.200 --> 33:31.929
Yeah, I'm fine.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.049
And Ishim is fully recovered.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.008
Yeah, okay.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.890
Maybe wish you hadn't done that just yet.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.247
Wait, why?

33:41.480 --> 33:42.606
This Lily chick?

33:43.240 --> 33:44.605
Says that her daughter was human.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.770
I think Ishim...

33:49.120 --> 33:50.246
I think he's playing you.

33:52.640 --> 33:53.846
You're back.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.605
So what's new?

34:05.480 --> 34:08.723
Is it true, Ishim?

34:09.120 --> 34:10.121
Is what true?

34:10.280 --> 34:12.009
Lily Sunder's daughter,

34:12.679 --> 34:13.966
was she human?

34:14.159 --> 34:15.969
- Who told you that?
- DEAN: <i>She did.</i>

34:16.400 --> 34:17.889
Said you were pretty obsessed.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.964
Well, she's a liar.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.641
Why would she lie?

34:21.880 --> 34:24.326
She's human. It's kind of what they do.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.643
Well, if she's a liar,
she's pretty good at it.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.809
You, on the other hand, kind of suck.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.130
Who are you gonna believe?

34:33.400 --> 34:36.324
Your brother, or some filthy ape

34:36.920 --> 34:39.730
who's always talking down to you,
always mocking you?

34:39.920 --> 34:41.842
You know,
Cass and I might not agree all the time,

34:42.000 --> 34:43.842
but at least he knows
who his real friends are.

34:44.880 --> 34:47.326
Why do his words
bother you so much, Ishim?

34:47.639 --> 34:49.880
Who is he to question my choices?

34:50.679 --> 34:52.250
Who is he to question yours?

34:52.520 --> 34:55.683
Well, it seems that some of my choices
may need to be questioned.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.764
Now, tell me. The girl, was she human?

34:59.520 --> 35:01.443
Oh, you're not gonna like the answer.

35:10.640 --> 35:13.246
I used to envy you, Castiel.
You believe that?

35:18.560 --> 35:21.370
You survived Hell, you were chosen by God.

35:22.920 --> 35:27.642
And now look at you. You're just sad.
And pathetically weak.

35:32.160 --> 35:36.051
So, now, I'm going to help you.

35:37.080 --> 35:39.242
I'm going to cure you
of your human weakness.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.529
Same way I cured my own,

35:43.240 --> 35:44.730
by cutting it out.

35:53.560 --> 35:54.721
Don't move.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.361
Do it.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.849
You blast me away,
you blast away every angel in the room.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.206
I'll survive.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.007
Castiel, on the other hand? He's hurt.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.564
He might live, or he might just end up
a bloody smear on the wall.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.165
Roll the dice.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.086
Yeah. That's what I thought.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.769
Ishim! No!

36:27.000 --> 36:28.445
Hello, my love.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.361
Hey, hey.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.766
Thought you were supposed
to keep her out of this.

36:33.960 --> 36:34.961
Yeah, I changed my mind.

36:35.120 --> 36:37.122
Good call.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.770
All right, plan B. Come on.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.366
It's over.

36:59.640 --> 37:00.641
No.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.561
I will never be powerless again!

37:18.040 --> 37:19.883
You can't hold me here forever.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.369
You held him for long enough.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.722
SAM: All right. So, uh...

38:11.680 --> 38:12.806
What now?

38:14.200 --> 38:15.281
DEAN: He's dead.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.366
Are you done?

38:28.240 --> 38:32.643
Revenge is all I've had
for over 100 years.

38:33.480 --> 38:34.606
It's what I am.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.003
Wrong answer. You're done.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.366
Dean.

38:40.600 --> 38:41.931
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

38:43.400 --> 38:44.606
I was wrong.

38:45.240 --> 38:49.564
And while it's true that I didn't know
we were killing an innocent,

38:49.800 --> 38:51.643
ignorance is no excuse.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.521
I truly can't imagine
the depths of your loss.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.205
<i>This was your child.</i>

39:05.760 --> 39:07.250
<i>I can't imagine the pain.</i>

39:09.080 --> 39:10.923
So if you leave here

39:11.840 --> 39:14.127
and you find that you can't forgive me,

39:16.120 --> 39:17.531
I'll be waiting.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.681
Thank you.

39:41.560 --> 39:42.925
You earned it.

39:44.280 --> 39:48.080
Well, this will do very little for me,
but I appreciate the gesture.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.491
What Ishim said...

39:51.640 --> 39:53.847
You're not weak, Cass.
You know that, right?

39:55.600 --> 39:56.931
SAM: <i>I mean, obviously, you've changed.</i>

39:57.320 --> 39:59.687
But it's all been for the better, man.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.164
DEAN: <i>And you have been with us
every step of this long,</i>

40:03.520 --> 40:04.760
crazy thrill ride.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.924
And no matter how crazy it got,
you never backed down.

40:08.160 --> 40:09.844
And that takes real strength.

40:10.440 --> 40:11.805
Thank you.

40:12.320 --> 40:15.164
Cass, I don't like how the whole
Billie thing went down, okay?

40:15.320 --> 40:17.084
I know you thought you were
doing the right thing.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.687
And I'm not mad, I'm worried.

40:20.480 --> 40:25.088
Because things like cosmic consequences
have a habit of biting us in the ass.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.601
I know they do.

40:28.400 --> 40:32.007
But I don't regret what I did.
Even if it costs me my life.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.005
Don't say that, man.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.849
So what're you gonna do if you find Kelly
and, uh, Lucifer, Jr?

40:41.680 --> 40:43.842
It is a Nephilim, right?

40:44.600 --> 40:46.045
Oh, no, it's more than that.

40:46.520 --> 40:51.048
An ordinary Nephilim is one of the most
dangerous beings in all of creation.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.926
But one that's fathered by an archangel?

40:54.120 --> 40:55.724
The Devil himself? I...

40:56.520 --> 40:58.045
I can't imagine the power.

40:58.400 --> 41:01.529
But, Cass, at the end of the day,
it's a mom and her kid.

41:02.840 --> 41:05.047
I mean, do you think you'll be able to...

41:06.680 --> 41:09.729
There was a time
when I wouldn't have hesitated.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.884
But now, I don't know.

41:16.280 --> 41:17.691
So what're we gonna do?

41:21.040 --> 41:22.644
Let's drink.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.281
And hope we can find a better way.
