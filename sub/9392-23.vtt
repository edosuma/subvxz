TV ANNOUNCER: And now,
Quahog Channel Five presents:

00:37.004 --> 00:39.304
"Movie and a Bath
with a Guy Named Lou."

00:39.306 --> 00:41.540
Hey. It's Saturday night,
and you know what that means.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.108
We're gonna take a bath

00:43.110 --> 00:46.512
and watch the 1984
interesting movie, <i>Gremlins.</i>

00:46.514 --> 00:48.280
Now, the Gremlins are funny.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.082
I don't know
if those things are puppets

00:50.084 --> 00:51.683
or they put costumes
on dogs or something,

00:51.685 --> 00:54.319
but let's press "play"
and find out, huh?

00:54.321 --> 00:57.122
You can't get them things
wet, by the way,

00:57.124 --> 00:59.992
but don't worry,
this don't affect that.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.462
We interrupt this
program for some

01:03.464 --> 01:04.997
breaking news,
which is why

01:04.999 --> 01:06.632
I'm still
chewing a bagel.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.100
Mmm.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.601
Just-just roll
the footage.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.170
JOYCE: <i>A major drug bust</i>
<i>in Quahog today</i>

01:11.172 --> 01:14.773
<i>as police seized</i>
<i>over 100 kilos of cocaine.</i>

01:14.775 --> 01:16.108
TUCKER (smacks lips):
<i>Okay, I'm done.</i>

01:16.110 --> 01:17.443
<i>That's right, Joyce.</i>
<i>Apparently,</i>

01:17.445 --> 01:19.978
there were 100 kilos of cocaine
<i>right here in Quahog,</i>

01:19.980 --> 01:22.181
<i>and yet my guy can't get dick.</i>

01:22.183 --> 01:23.949
JOYCE: <i>Singled out</i>
<i>for special recognition</i>

01:23.951 --> 01:25.751
<i>in orchestrating</i>
<i>today's drug bust</i>

01:25.753 --> 01:27.786
<i>was Officer Joe Swanson.</i>

01:27.788 --> 01:30.456
It feels good to know that,
thanks to me and my colleagues,

01:30.458 --> 01:32.658
a lot fewer people
will be injecting cocaine

01:32.660 --> 01:34.593
into their penises tonight.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.694
Is that a thing?

01:35.696 --> 01:36.829
It's a great thing.

01:36.831 --> 01:38.964
(small applause)

01:38.966 --> 01:40.265
Great job, Joe!
Way to go!

01:40.267 --> 01:41.333
There he is!

01:41.335 --> 01:42.768
Hey, thanks, everybody.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.137
Hey, guys.
Hey, Joe, I saw you on TV.

01:45.139 --> 01:46.972
Now I have to go
through the five stages

01:46.974 --> 01:48.340
of having a celebrity friend.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.375
Oh, you're on TV!
That's so cool!

01:50.377 --> 01:52.044
We're going right
to the top together.

01:52.046 --> 01:53.812
Oh, you think
you're better than us, huh?

01:53.814 --> 01:55.147
Just one (bleep)
stroke of luck,

01:55.149 --> 01:58.484
I'm sorry I overreacted.
Look, you got to be careful.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.586
You need someone looking out
for you, who knows you.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.654
Someone you can trust.
Give me some money!

02:02.656 --> 02:05.090
Man, that was some pretty
impressive police work, Joe.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.692
Thanks, Quagmire.
I'll be honest,

02:06.694 --> 02:08.994
it was nice to be acknowledged
by the chief for once.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.829
Usually, he's just
reminding me

02:10.831 --> 02:12.831
that whatever punk
I'm roughing up ain't worth it.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.968
You son of a bitch!
I ought to kill you right here!

02:15.970 --> 02:18.670
Hey! This punk's
not worth it.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.038
You're right.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.076
You're not worth it.

02:26.679 --> 02:29.848
So, listen, if you guys
aren't doing anything later,

02:29.850 --> 02:32.684
the chief's throwing me a little
party to celebrate my bust.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.120
I am going to let Quagmire
answer first.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.421
Yeah, I'll go.
I shall go, too.

02:36.423 --> 02:39.424
Oh, great. I'll see
you guys tonight.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.861
(tires screech)

02:42.863 --> 02:44.096
Oh, God, buddy, I'm sorry.

02:44.098 --> 02:45.397
You okay?

03:05.084 --> 03:07.219
You bastard!

03:31.945 --> 03:34.580
Well, now I've seen
Woodrow Wilson naked.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.748
(grunts)

03:48.761 --> 03:49.828
(yells)

03:54.701 --> 03:57.035
(screaming)

04:15.989 --> 04:19.057
(tires screech)

04:36.943 --> 04:39.011
(whirring)

04:48.821 --> 04:50.055
(electrical buzzing)

04:56.095 --> 04:57.429
(steam hissing)

05:01.701 --> 05:04.169
(whooshing)

05:14.480 --> 05:16.581
(whooshing)

05:46.145 --> 05:48.380
(electrical buzzing)

06:01.127 --> 06:03.261
(grunts)

06:17.110 --> 06:19.044
(screaming cluck)

06:27.253 --> 06:29.488
(whirring)

06:40.032 --> 06:41.533
(screaming cluck)

06:46.372 --> 06:47.939
(screams)

07:07.994 --> 07:09.161
(whirring)

07:09.163 --> 07:11.830
(screaming cluck)

07:26.412 --> 07:29.247
(whooshing)

08:01.013 --> 08:03.248
(dramatic music plays)

08:07.653 --> 08:10.755
Hey, Bonnie, I made a
major drug bust today.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.491
The biggest one the
force has ever seen.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.092
That's great, Joe.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.694
You don't seem
very excited.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.529
I mean, this is a
huge deal for me.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.965
The chief is even throwing
me a party tonight.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.600
I don't know
if I can take another

08:21.602 --> 08:23.268
evening of
sympathetic eye contact

08:23.270 --> 08:25.504
from all
the other wives.

08:26.806 --> 08:29.541
Well, just so you know,
this is a really big deal.

08:29.543 --> 08:32.944
They even asked me to be a guest
on  <i>Muy Importante!</i>

08:32.946 --> 08:36.681
(Latin music plays)

08:36.683 --> 08:39.417
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Muy Importante!</i>

08:42.755 --> 08:45.724
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Muy Importante!</i>

08:48.928 --> 08:52.030
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Muy Importante!</i>

08:52.032 --> 08:55.634
<i>Muy Importante!</i>

08:55.636 --> 08:58.336
ALL:
<i>Muy Importante!</i>

08:58.338 --> 09:02.173
A donkey just bit
a child in the hallway.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.747
Wow, I've never been
to a cop bar before.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.015
Yeah, look at
the bartender.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.850
I bet working here,
she's one of those women

09:11.852 --> 09:14.085
who's tough as nails
and good at giving sass.

09:15.922 --> 09:17.322
What will it be, fellas?

09:17.324 --> 09:19.858
I'd like to cram both your boobs
into a martini glass.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.961
(sobbing)

09:22.963 --> 09:25.096
I-I think she's just
a normal woman.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.765
To Joe Swanson!

09:26.767 --> 09:28.033
And the biggest
drug bust

09:28.035 --> 09:29.367
in the history
of Quahog!

09:29.369 --> 09:31.169
(all cheering)

09:32.939 --> 09:35.807
Officer Swanson, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.442
I'm Nora. I just joined the
force.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.743
Nice to meet you.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.745
Wow, I've heard
so much about you.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.581
You're like a legend
at the academy.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.182
Is it true you
got straight A's

09:44.184 --> 09:46.284
in Officer Henderson's
Overintensity Workshop?

09:46.286 --> 09:47.953
You're damn right I did!

09:47.955 --> 09:49.955
Well, you did some
great work today.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.590
And I mean
regular-person great,

09:51.592 --> 09:52.924
not just
wheelchair-person great.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.826
Yeah, I guess.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.162
You seem a little distracted.
Is everything okay?

09:57.164 --> 09:59.864
Yeah, sorry,
I was just thinking about...

09:59.866 --> 10:02.500
someone should have come
tonight, but they didn't.

10:02.502 --> 10:04.102
Ah, it's nothing.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.470
That's good.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.806
Hey, Officer Swanson?
Yeah?

10:07.808 --> 10:10.075
You know how they say
never meet your heroes?

10:10.077 --> 10:12.344
Well, they don't say anything
about kissing them.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.980
Whoa!

10:14.982 --> 10:17.015
Geez, every cop
in town is here.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.517
I know. Who do you think is
taking care of the city?

10:19.519 --> 10:21.086
No.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.520
No.

10:22.522 --> 10:23.955
No.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.490
No.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.125
(horn honking)

10:27.127 --> 10:28.793
MAN:
What the hell?
Come on!

10:28.795 --> 10:30.762
No drive. Is wet.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.104
Hey-hey, fun party
last night, Joe.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.939
You guys, I got something
to tell you.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.575
The weirdest thing happened
to me at that party.

10:43.577 --> 10:45.677
I got kissed
by this chick cop.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.079
No way! What's she look like?
Is she hot?

10:48.081 --> 10:49.614
Well, I don't know. Uh...

10:49.616 --> 10:51.750
Is Elizabeth Perkins hot?

10:51.752 --> 10:55.320
I... I, uh...
I-I don't... I don't know.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.088
Way to go, Joe.
Did you bang her?

10:57.090 --> 10:59.257
What? Of course
not, Quagmire.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.659
I mean, I'm a
married man.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.327
I could never
cheat on Bonnie.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.361
Well, under normal
circumstances,

11:03.363 --> 11:04.763
you'd be right
to say that,

11:04.765 --> 11:05.830
but in this case,

11:05.832 --> 11:07.165
cheating would be
the only fair thing.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.800
What? What are you
talking about?

11:08.802 --> 11:11.102
Come on. Didn't Bonnie
have that affair in Paris?

11:11.104 --> 11:13.705
Oh, yeah. I don't want
to talk about that.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.607
Joe, how can I put this
delicately?

11:15.609 --> 11:19.077
He used his stinky French wiener
to defile her.

11:19.079 --> 11:22.113
Wow. That's a...
real hit above the belt.

11:22.115 --> 11:25.016
But I'm still not sure that's
a reason to betray Bonnie.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.585
Come on, Joe. Sleeping with
this girl will even things up.

11:27.587 --> 11:30.121
You can't have that kind of
imbalance in your relationship.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.957
In fact, you owe it to Bonnie
to have sex with this woman.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.292
It's for the good
of your marriage.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.860
Yeah, you should
go for it, Joe.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.829
Secrets are what
keep a marriage fresh.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.497
I have a CB radio
in the basement.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.133
I go down there a couple times
a week to have CB sex.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.535
Lois has no idea.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.470
Breaker breaker one-nine.
What's your 20?

11:45.472 --> 11:47.739
(woman speaks
in garbled, staticky voice)

11:49.642 --> 11:53.178
Ah, it's so hot
just knowing you're in a truck.

11:55.915 --> 11:57.916
Good morning,
Officer Swanson.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.751
Oh, hey... Nora.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.486
Uh, listen, I...
It's okay, Joe.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.854
You don't need
to explain.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.956
I stepped over the line
at the bar last night.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.024
I'm... I'm sorry.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.026
It's not that I don't
find you attractive.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.828
I do. I just...

12:09.830 --> 12:11.296
I'm married and...
I get it.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.098
I totally
understand, Joe.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.333
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.334
Hello?

12:16.336 --> 12:17.335
BONNIE:
Joe?

12:17.337 --> 12:18.336
Bonnie?

12:18.338 --> 12:19.337
Oh.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.839
I-I meant to call someone else.

12:20.841 --> 12:21.906
Oh.

12:21.908 --> 12:22.941
Yeah.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.309
So, how is everything?

12:24.311 --> 12:25.677
(click)

12:25.679 --> 12:28.012
(sighs)

12:29.348 --> 12:31.416
QUAGMIRE: <i>Didn't Bonnie</i>
<i>have that affair in Paris?</i>

12:31.418 --> 12:34.252
PETER: <i>He used his stinky</i>
<i>French wiener to defile her.</i>

12:34.254 --> 12:36.488
QUAGMIRE: <i>Didn't Bonnie</i>
<i>have that affair in Paris?</i>

12:36.490 --> 12:39.591
PETER: <i>He used his stinky</i>
<i>French wiener to defile her.</i>

12:39.593 --> 12:41.292
<i>Hey, Quagmire,</i>
<i>we're in Joe's head.</i>

12:41.294 --> 12:42.761
<i>Hey, let's mess with him.</i>

12:42.763 --> 12:44.596
<i>I'm going to leave a fart</i>
<i>trapped in here.</i>

12:44.598 --> 12:45.864
(passing gas)

12:45.866 --> 12:46.931
(Peter and Quagmire laughing)

12:46.933 --> 12:48.700
PETER: <i>All right,</i>
<i>let's get out of here.</i>

12:48.702 --> 12:50.969
(rapid footsteps,
car door opens and closes)

12:50.971 --> 12:51.970
I want you.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.037
I want you, too.

12:53.039 --> 12:53.972
Come on.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.174
I have a little
place we can go to.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.942
NORA: Wow. I've
never seen a sofa

12:57.944 --> 12:59.310
in a bathroom
stall before.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.479
JOE: Well, I'm the only
one who comes in here,

13:01.481 --> 13:03.014
so I figured I'd
make it my own.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.616
How are you enjoying
your steak?

13:04.618 --> 13:05.950
Mmm. It's delicious.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.086
Let me put another
log on the fire.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.354
(flame whooshing and crackling)

13:09.356 --> 13:10.522
Thanks, Joe.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.290
It was getting
a little chilly in here.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.925
That's 'cause you're
all the way over there.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.094
Well, let me
fix that.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.495
(kissing)

13:17.497 --> 13:19.030
Oh, Joe.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.031
Oh, Nora.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.332
Did you bring
protection?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.500
Oh, don't worry.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.068
Nothing comes out
of the front.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.974
What a great day
for Joe and Bonnie.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.442
This is Kevin's
first birthday

13:31.444 --> 13:33.011
since he came home
from Iraq.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.913
Why does Kevin always sit
at the bus stop,

13:34.915 --> 13:36.514
but never gets on a bus?

13:36.516 --> 13:37.949
Please don't
bring that up.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.851
Don't bring
anything he does up.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.519
Hey, you guys.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.854
You're right on time.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.490
Kevin just woke up screaming
from his afternoon nap.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.991
Mom, it's <i>my</i>
<i>birthday,</i>

13:46.993 --> 13:48.426
and you invited
<i>your</i> friends.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.261
All yours are dead!

13:50.263 --> 13:51.596
Hey, guys.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.464
Uh, can I talk to
you for a second?

13:53.466 --> 13:54.966
I did something
terrible.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.202
Ah, hey, we've all
done terrible things.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.204
Attention, everyone.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.105
The plane is sinking,
so I need you all

14:01.107 --> 14:03.208
to proceed onto the
floating slide.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.311
PETER:
<i>Dear airplane people,</i>

14:06.313 --> 14:08.746
<i>I owe you one floating slide.</i>

14:08.748 --> 14:10.982
<i>And just so you know,</i>
<i>the guy stewardess</i>

14:10.984 --> 14:13.084
<i>was angry gay, not happy gay.</i>

14:13.086 --> 14:14.319
What does it say?
Nothing.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.354
Just instructions
and stuff.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.956
Oh, my God. You actually
went through with it?

14:17.958 --> 14:18.957
How was it?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.191
I don't know, you guys.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.526
I thought I would feel better

14:21.528 --> 14:23.294
after I slept with Nora,
but I don't.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.129
I just feel really guilty.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.031
And I'm not mad
at Bonnie anymore;

14:27.033 --> 14:29.000
I'm just mad at myself.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.135
Guys, am I the only one
who thinks it's weird

14:31.137 --> 14:32.203
talking about Joe
cheating on Bonnie

14:32.205 --> 14:33.638
in front of their baby?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.173
MAN'S VOICE:
<i>I think we can all benefit</i>

14:35.175 --> 14:36.941
<i>from a little strange</i>
<i>now and then.</i>

14:36.943 --> 14:38.409
<i>I know I will.</i>

14:39.445 --> 14:41.012
Uh-oh.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.847
The baby monitor.
Wha...?

14:42.849 --> 14:44.148
The baby monitor.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.783
You cheated on me?

14:45.785 --> 14:47.118
I-I, uh...

14:47.120 --> 14:49.187
You bastard!

14:49.189 --> 14:50.922
Bonnie, please.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.490
After all
I do for you,

14:52.492 --> 14:54.659
this is how
you repay me?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.995
Well, how do you think
I felt when I found out

14:56.997 --> 14:58.296
you slept with that
French guy, huh?

14:58.298 --> 15:00.164
I never slept
with Francois.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.300
What? But Peter said...

15:02.302 --> 15:04.135
Lois, didn't you say
that Bonnie slept with him?

15:04.137 --> 15:05.837
No, Peter. I said
she wanted to.

15:05.839 --> 15:07.171
Damn it, Peter!

15:07.173 --> 15:08.439
Now, hold on.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.275
In my defense,
it is my experience

15:10.277 --> 15:13.011
that I am generally correct
about most things.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.512
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

15:14.514 --> 15:17.248
Bonnie's been driving me away
for some time now.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.117
What? Driving you away?

15:19.119 --> 15:23.087
Do you have any idea
how hard it is living with you?

15:23.089 --> 15:25.156
They still have
one of those TVs

15:25.158 --> 15:27.091
with the big, fat back.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.526
Maybe we should
all leave.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.527
No!
No!

15:29.529 --> 15:30.628
Everyone stays.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.130
I want this to
be a disaster.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.098
'Cause this has been
a long time coming.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.501
You care about nothing
except yourself.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.936
You son of a bitch.

15:37.938 --> 15:41.105
I got a license to operate
a sex crane for you.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.174
And I got earplugs so I
could put up with that

15:43.176 --> 15:45.109
(imitating Bonnie):
horrible voice of yours.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.612
I'm not an impressionist,
but you get the idea.

15:47.614 --> 15:52.083
I perform purification rituals
on my body after we have sex.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.819
I find it cleanses
the immeasurable sadness

15:54.821 --> 15:56.688
of having lain with a wretch.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.022
I want a divorce!

15:58.024 --> 15:59.290
You got it!

15:59.292 --> 16:01.659
Sorry. I opened
some of the gifts.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.535
Does the Swanson divorce
mean that I

16:10.537 --> 16:12.270
have to go live
with Grandma and Grandpa?

16:12.272 --> 16:14.072
No, Chris, it does not.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.640
That doesn't even
make any sense.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.075
Peter, I can't believe

16:17.077 --> 16:18.977
you would encourage Joe
to have an affair.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.445
Look, Lois, it's
in the Bible.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.980
What's in the Bible?

16:21.982 --> 16:23.081
I-I don't know.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.116
Doesn't that always
cover it somehow?

16:25.118 --> 16:26.784
Peter, you blew up
their marriage.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.753
This was
a huge mistake.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.321
Well, we've all made mistakes.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.926
Eh.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.096
(Stewie screaming)

16:38.098 --> 16:40.498
Why did the sign say
"not an exit"?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.800
It should have just said
"gorilla door."

16:42.802 --> 16:44.202
(screaming)

16:47.139 --> 16:49.273
So, it's really
over, huh?

16:49.275 --> 16:50.975
After all
these years?

16:50.977 --> 16:52.243
I'm afraid so.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.778
But let's be
honest, Peter.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.014
Bonnie and I seem
to have grown apart.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.115
Boy, I never would have seen

16:57.117 --> 16:58.983
this day coming
when we first met.

16:58.985 --> 17:02.086

back together.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.962
Joe just told me
how he and Bonnie met.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.531
So I figure, all we got to do
is find a way

18:20.533 --> 18:22.100
to recreate the magic
of that night.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.367
Well, we better
do something soon,

18:23.369 --> 18:24.669
'cause I just
talked to Bonnie

18:24.671 --> 18:26.270
and she's already
on D-Date.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.805
What the hell's D-Date?

18:27.807 --> 18:29.307
Diarrhea Date.
It's filthy.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.808
But she found someone,

18:30.810 --> 18:32.777
and they're doing whatever
they do tomorrow.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.179

wrong with people?

18:36.682 --> 18:38.449
Thanks for inviting
me to lunch, Lois,

18:38.451 --> 18:40.585
but why are we eating
at a strip club?

18:40.587 --> 18:42.954
I know the waitress here
from water aerobics.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.089
She said she'd
give us 20% off.

18:46.158 --> 18:47.959
All units, all units.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.094
We have a disturbance
at the Fuzzy Clam.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.028
This is Officer Swanson.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.463
What's the problem?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.765
Well, one of the dancers
was dancing with a guy

18:54.767 --> 18:56.868
and saying, "You're my favorite,
you're my favorite,"

18:56.870 --> 18:58.636
but now she's dancing
with another guy.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.937
That's not a crime.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.606
Well, shouldn't it be?
