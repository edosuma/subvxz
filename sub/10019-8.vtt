00:12.936 --> 00:17.158
If you don't have your child's card
with you, let me know.

00:17.319 --> 00:20.483
Chuny, can I get a hand
in here, please?

00:22.278 --> 00:25.442
Okay, I'll be with you in a second.
Did everybody get a cookie?

00:25.637 --> 00:26.913
Excuse me, pal.

00:27.109 --> 00:30.272
I need you to explain to her
about the lead.

00:34.979 --> 00:36.092
That ain't Spanish.

00:36.259 --> 00:41.277
We need to take some blood to see
if the baby's been exposed to lead.

00:41.441 --> 00:43.776
- Lead is very bad for children.
- Okay.

00:43.938 --> 00:47.100
- Lf there's a problem, we'll call you.
- Okay.

00:47.264 --> 00:50.112
You sign this, and the nurse
will take some blood.

00:50.272 --> 00:52.573
- Okay.
- Next, please!

00:52.703 --> 00:56.281
- I think that was informed consent.
- Close enough.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.999
- Hey, old man.
- You again?

01:00.446 --> 01:03.544
Yeah, I know... Halloween.
Charlie, right?

01:03.709 --> 01:07.450
You gave me some condoms.
You were a couple of years late.

01:07.612 --> 01:09.849
- You're telling me that's yours?
- Why not?

01:10.013 --> 01:13.906
- His dad's a Pakistani dude.
- And his name is Lopez because...

01:14.075 --> 01:17.042
Okay. His mom, Gloria,
is a friend of mine.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.577
She got a job today,
so I'm babysitting.

01:19.738 --> 01:21.648
She heard they were
giving out free shots.

01:21.818 --> 01:24.468
Ahmed hasn't been seen
since he was 4 months old?

01:24.602 --> 01:26.544
- I guess.
- Let me see. Let's take a look.

01:26.713 --> 01:29.014
What's he now?
About a year and a half?

01:29.209 --> 01:32.591
We need to have
his mother's address for a follow-up.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.093
- They live at Sisters, over on Grand.
- The shelter?

01:35.255 --> 01:39.116
- Don't we need parental consent?
- That's why I told you. I'm the mom.

01:39.286 --> 01:41.937
All right, Ms. Lopez.
Why don't you sign right there?

01:42.102 --> 01:45.003
- I don't know about this.
- Want me to send him home?

01:45.174 --> 01:46.286
Okay, next!

01:46.453 --> 01:51.209
- Charlie, shouldn't you be in school?
- We're off. It's Career Day.

01:54.035 --> 01:57.330
- BP's 200 over 140.
- Try to relax, Mr. Reynolds, okay?

01:57.459 --> 02:00.208
- Ultrasound's ready.
- Take a look. Tell me what you see.

02:00.371 --> 02:06.086
- You wanna start him on beta-blockers?
- Yes. Esmolol, 5 grams and 500 ml.

02:06.321 --> 02:09.354
- And four of morphine.
- It's a triple-A about four cm.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.390
- Dr. Lewis, I was afraid I'd missed you.
- I'm on till 2.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.788
- It won't be the same without you.
- Stop it. It's hard enough.

02:15.951 --> 02:17.577
Give Dr. Carter the bullet.

02:17.743 --> 02:20.906
72-year-old male. History of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia.

02:21.070 --> 02:24.104
One previous MI. Pain began
in left, lower quadrant a week ago.

02:24.271 --> 02:27.717
The ultrasound shows an abdominal
aneurysm, four cm.

02:27.854 --> 02:31.300
- We'll take him off your hands.
- Not so fast, Dr. Carter.

02:31.468 --> 02:34.817
- Check his femoral pulses.
- The ultrasound indicates surgery.

02:35.020 --> 02:37.769
- What do you think, Dr. Doyle?
- I'm with Carter. Chance of rupture.

02:37.931 --> 02:41.279
- Ten percent. And the femoral pulses?
- Two plus bilaterally.

02:41.482 --> 02:43.337
So good blood flow
to lower extremities.

02:43.498 --> 02:46.018
- Ultrasound indicates a risk.
- Shows no leakage.

02:46.185 --> 02:48.804
- Let's get a CT to confirm.
- You wanna manage it medically.

02:48.970 --> 02:51.686
I'd like to try. The machines
can give us test results.

02:51.849 --> 02:54.631
But they like to keep us here
for our diagnostic judgment.

02:54.792 --> 02:57.660
This is her last shift.
Maybe our last patient together.

02:57.831 --> 03:00.449
- She's trying to bust me.
- One has to hold you surgeons back.

03:00.583 --> 03:04.543
- Page me when you need me.
- Okay, let's get him to CT.

03:04.710 --> 03:07.611
- Guess I got a lot to learn.
- Yeah, it takes practice.

03:07.814 --> 03:11.555
Don't be afraid to step up. You
should have seen me in my first year.

03:11.748 --> 03:15.010
Don't believe her.
She was always this good.

03:25.314 --> 03:29.055
- Are you with the moving company?
- No, I'm a friend of Susan's.

03:29.217 --> 03:32.533
You're the one who's
interested in taking over the lease?

03:32.673 --> 03:35.968
- Phyllis Dodds. I'm the landlady.
- Hi, Phyllis.

03:36.128 --> 03:38.298
- Are you okay?
- It's just a muscle spasm.

03:38.495 --> 03:39.869
Probably stress.

03:40.063 --> 03:43.608
It's a great one bedroom. Lots
of closet space, nice cross-breeze...

03:43.774 --> 03:46.295
...and a quiet street.
- Yeah, I've spent some time here.

03:46.463 --> 03:50.488
- You worked with Susan?
- Three years. Actually, more.

03:50.654 --> 03:53.370
- Are you single?
- Divorced. And I've got...

03:53.533 --> 03:55.540
...my daughter every other Saturday.

03:55.709 --> 03:58.358
No live-ins, no parties, no pets?

03:58.523 --> 04:01.306
- None of the above.
- A landlady's dream.

04:01.468 --> 04:03.539
At least it worked for someone.

04:03.674 --> 04:08.082
Oh, good. All the boxes go.
The luggage stays.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.282
Place looks a lot bigger
without Susan's stuff, doesn't it?

04:11.481 --> 04:13.782
A whole lot emptier.

05:12.205 --> 05:16.099
We're screwed. We can pull
all interns off their electives.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.689
Unless Senior Residents
lose vacation time...

05:18.892 --> 05:20.801
...we won't be able
to cover the schedule.

05:21.003 --> 05:24.200
- Are you okay?
- I didn't get much sleep last night.

05:24.364 --> 05:27.778
- What did you say after "screwed"?
- It's gonna be a pain to lose Susan.

05:27.946 --> 05:29.856
Big mistake for her. Phoenix.

05:30.027 --> 05:32.579
What was Morgenstern thinking
letting her go?

05:32.745 --> 05:34.818
I wanna be supportive
of lifestyle choices...

05:34.985 --> 05:36.958
...but we're getting
the short end here.

05:37.128 --> 05:40.063
- Good morning, all.
- Hang tough, Coach Pino.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.014
35-year-old roller hockey coach
got slammed into the board.

05:43.175 --> 05:46.339
- Possible hip dislocation.
- Dr. Weaver, can I take this one?

05:46.535 --> 05:49.950
- Did you guys nail him?
- He told us to play the body.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.444
Never apologize for a good
hip check. Right, coach?

05:53.637 --> 05:55.906
- Sure you're feeling okay?
- Yeah. Stiff muscles.

05:56.069 --> 05:59.297
- Might be coming down with something.
- Go home. Maybe your only chance.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.274
I think I'm gonna stick around.

06:02.435 --> 06:05.632
Hey. So T-minus
five hours and counting?

06:05.795 --> 06:08.663
- I'm getting nervous.
- You'll do great in Arizona.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.689
The winters there are like heaven.

06:10.818 --> 06:12.606
I don't wanna leave anyone
in the lurch.

06:12.769 --> 06:16.184
We'll muddle through.
I signed the lease.

06:16.353 --> 06:19.483
Great! It'd be a shame
to let that place go.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.550
And I'll never forget your address.

06:22.752 --> 06:24.126
Wanna help me
with a teaching demo?

06:25.375 --> 06:28.855
- You give him five of morphine?
- And Valium and 100 methohexital.

06:29.022 --> 06:32.470
The first nurse, in this case Susan,
applies counter traction.

06:32.638 --> 06:36.379
Good job, Susan.
Then you grab behind the knee.

06:36.541 --> 06:39.290
And you lift. And you lift...

06:39.452 --> 06:41.786
...until you feel that...

06:41.948 --> 06:45.111
...hip slip back into place.

06:45.243 --> 06:46.967
- That's it.
- Okay.

06:47.131 --> 06:48.821
- Thanks, Susan.
- Anytime.

06:49.018 --> 06:52.018
Anytime in the next four hours.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.633
Dislocations aren't tough.
You'll get it.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.295
I know. I've done a bunch of them.

06:57.497 --> 07:00.496
- Why did you ask for help?
- I didn't.

07:02.552 --> 07:04.690
- That was perfect.
- Will you take one for me?

07:04.855 --> 07:07.342
We will do anything
for you, Dr. Keaton.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.031
- Say "discharge."
- Discharge!

07:10.198 --> 07:11.791
- Great.
- There's Dr. Benton.

07:11.958 --> 07:14.892
The Herlihys are taking
Megan home today.

07:15.029 --> 07:16.818
Yeah, I heard. Congratulations.

07:16.981 --> 07:20.111
David, get one with
Dr. Benton in it, please.

07:20.276 --> 07:24.073
- It would mean so much.
- Smile.

07:26.099 --> 07:27.310
We owe you so much.

07:27.475 --> 07:30.638
We're not usually shy about
taking credit. But in this case...

07:30.802 --> 07:33.901
...Megan deserves
all the congratulations.

07:34.066 --> 07:37.229
- We'll be in touch.
- Bye.

07:39.185 --> 07:40.745
- That was awkward.
- Why?

07:40.912 --> 07:43.727
- I almost killed their baby.
- Never begrudge a good outcome.

07:43.888 --> 07:47.684
- It's nothing to be proud of.
- But sometimes the gods smile.

07:47.823 --> 07:51.171
- Hi.
- Carter, what are you doing here?

07:51.342 --> 07:54.855
Actually, I was coming to...

07:55.054 --> 08:00.138
- To look at the literature review?
- Yes, I was. I am, if you are.

08:00.301 --> 08:02.886
- The literature review?
- I kidnapped your intern.

08:03.052 --> 08:05.539
I hope you don't mind,
but I'm up against a deadline...

08:05.708 --> 08:08.969
...so I asked Dr. Carter to contribute
to an article I'm writing.

08:09.131 --> 08:11.464
- Yes, you did.
- As long as it doesn't interfere...

08:11.626 --> 08:14.343
...with your other work.
- No, this thing with Dr. Keaton...

08:14.506 --> 08:16.361
This article won't get in the way.

08:16.522 --> 08:19.336
I can go over
your first draft at 3.

08:19.465 --> 08:23.326
Okay? Okay, see you 3.

08:25.192 --> 08:28.006
- Clearing out your locker?
- This is too weird.

08:28.199 --> 08:30.239
- What time is your train?
- 4:20.

08:30.439 --> 08:33.121
I have to go by my house
and pick up my stuff.

08:33.285 --> 08:37.409
- I'm not cutting it too close, am I?
- You're on until 2?

08:37.573 --> 08:40.224
There's no farewell thing
going on, is there?

08:40.389 --> 08:42.876
- No. Not that I've heard of.
- Okay, good.

08:43.044 --> 08:46.306
- Mark is acting so odd.
- Well, he's gonna miss you.

08:47.236 --> 08:51.807
He thinks I should go. If I have to
hear how great Phoenix is once more...

08:51.939 --> 08:56.379
He's just trying to be a good sport,
judging from how miserable he looks.

08:57.122 --> 08:58.648
Having second thoughts?

08:58.849 --> 09:01.053
I never made a decision
that seemed so right.

09:01.217 --> 09:03.802
You know, once I made it,
I just felt great.

09:05.088 --> 09:08.861
- Of course I'm having second thoughts.
- I wish you weren't going.

09:09.023 --> 09:11.805
- But you do look happy.
- Do I?

09:11.967 --> 09:13.788
I'm afraid that I'm not happy at all.

09:13.950 --> 09:15.772
Just barging in
on Chloe and Joe's happiness.

09:15.934 --> 09:18.618
Well, she owes you
a couple of barge-ins.

09:18.781 --> 09:20.439
Susan, there you are.

09:20.605 --> 09:22.460
- What's wrong?
- I need a second opinion.

09:22.589 --> 09:24.279
Sure.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.385
See? Odd.

09:29.115 --> 09:31.155
I wanna get your opinion on a patient.

09:31.355 --> 09:33.362
- Are you coming down with something?
- I hope not.

09:33.563 --> 09:35.667
Exam Room 1,
28-year-old smoker on the pill...

09:35.834 --> 09:37.525
...complains of shortness of breath.

09:37.690 --> 09:42.097
Diffuse low voltage on her EKG. I'm
thinking pericarditis. Get an echo.

09:42.265 --> 09:44.719
- That's what I'd do.
- Could it be pulmonary embolism?

09:44.888 --> 09:48.979
She's at risk. Abnormal EKG.
It could be lead placement.

09:49.144 --> 09:51.892
- No, I'd go with the echo.
- You sure?

09:52.055 --> 09:55.088
It's a no-brainer. You could always
get a VQ scan if the echo's negative.

09:55.222 --> 09:58.091
That's what I was thinking.
So I'll order an echo.

09:58.262 --> 10:02.636
The Mutt and Jeff of emergency
medicine pooling their expertise...

10:02.837 --> 10:05.934
...before she leaves us in the dust.
- Doug, stop.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.205
Randi, call the lab,
pick up these tests.

10:08.372 --> 10:11.720
- Where have you been?
- The Hellmobile.

10:11.891 --> 10:14.258
Diaper rash, Curtain 3.
Saved it just for you.

10:14.419 --> 10:17.233
Anspaugh made you ride
the mobile again so soon?

10:17.394 --> 10:20.775
No. The immunization
program was Dr. Ross' idea.

10:20.945 --> 10:24.426
- Is this true?
- It keeps me off the streets.

10:24.592 --> 10:28.039
I got sunscreen.
I got a turquoise belt buckle.

10:28.176 --> 10:30.762
- I got a snake bite kit.
- What for?

10:30.928 --> 10:32.520
Susan's farewell.

10:32.719 --> 10:37.028
- And we've got a cactus-shaped cake.
- I don't know. She'll hate this.

10:37.230 --> 10:40.612
Of course she'll hate it.
That's why we're doing it.

10:40.814 --> 10:44.839
- You look lousy.
- I've got this neck thing and fever.

10:45.004 --> 10:46.946
- There's a flu around.
- You didn't do it?

10:47.116 --> 10:49.986
- You didn't tell her how you feel.
- She's leaving.

10:50.155 --> 10:52.162
She's made her decision.

10:52.331 --> 10:56.105
I don't see any point
in saying anything.

10:58.089 --> 11:01.351
In two hours, we'll have a 1 -week-old
male baby on this table.

11:01.482 --> 11:03.368
And what do we know
about this poor soul.

11:03.529 --> 11:07.206
He has a distended abdomen,
visible peristalsis.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.789
The upper-GI series showed...

11:09.992 --> 11:14.301
...a partial small bowel obstruction.
- When we open him up we expect...?

11:14.471 --> 11:16.740
- A malrotation of the gut.
- Meaning...?

11:16.903 --> 11:20.699
The 10th week of fetal development, the
cephalic limb of the intestinal loop...

11:20.869 --> 11:24.763
...elongated and twisted 270 degrees.
- Begin with the duodenum.

11:24.933 --> 11:27.551
What would you expect to see
in a normal 1 -week-old?

11:27.717 --> 11:30.269
What? You mean, like
the duodenum leads to...?

11:30.404 --> 11:33.818
Close your eyes. Try to see it.

11:36.163 --> 11:40.156
The duodenum leads to jejunum,
which connects to the ileum.

11:40.354 --> 11:43.669
Okay, but slow down
and tell me what you see.

11:43.873 --> 11:46.971
- What do you mean?
- Start with the image of...

11:47.136 --> 11:49.110
...a healthy gut.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.378
I'm seeing the head of the pancreas.

11:52.543 --> 11:55.444
It's like a tiny fist
holding two straws.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.786
You mean the
mesenteric artery and vein.

11:58.527 --> 12:01.657
It's nestled in the open
sea of the duodenum.

12:01.822 --> 12:05.498
And its surface is like fine pebbles.

12:05.628 --> 12:09.011
A beautiful shade of tannish yellow.

12:09.181 --> 12:11.416
Go on. You try it.

12:13.307 --> 12:15.445
Okay, the...

12:16.794 --> 12:20.089
The pancreas is...

12:20.281 --> 12:23.893
...shaped like a tadpole
with a big head.

12:26.488 --> 12:28.790
It narrows into a tail...

12:28.953 --> 12:31.952
...that curls
into the hilum of the spleen.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.421
Go on. Now see the spleen.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.554
- Susan.
- Yes.

12:40.726 --> 12:43.792
We had a rocky start, but I thought
we worked on our relationship...

12:43.990 --> 12:45.679
...and developed
a professional rapport.

12:45.844 --> 12:47.371
- What's this about?
- The smoker in 1.

12:47.573 --> 12:49.777
I diagnosed her
with a pulmonary embolism...

12:49.941 --> 12:52.809
...and consented her for a VQ.
- I thought it was Mark's patient.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.979
- He asked me for my opinion.
- My beef is with him then.

12:56.146 --> 12:59.442
Let me talk to him.
I think I know what the problem is.

12:59.603 --> 13:02.155
- No. Absolutely not.
- It ticks me off.

13:02.322 --> 13:04.329
- I probably could go up there.
- No, you can't.

13:04.498 --> 13:06.537
It wouldn't kill me to finish off
this one shift up in Neuro.

13:06.704 --> 13:09.388
It's the principle.
Last week Lydia went up there...

13:09.521 --> 13:11.593
...and it encouraged them to do it more.

13:11.759 --> 13:13.669
I got called up to Neuro
to fill in for the day.

13:13.871 --> 13:16.772
May I speak to the nursing
administrator. Hathaway in the ER.

13:16.975 --> 13:19.015
When do you max out
on your pension?

13:19.215 --> 13:23.404
- Two more years.
- They are hassling the senior nurses.

13:23.566 --> 13:26.316
Hey! What's in the box? Bridal Shop?

13:26.478 --> 13:29.510
- You and Al finally set the date?
- No. The opposite.

13:29.677 --> 13:31.914
- She broke off with Al.
- I'm returning this ridiculous...

13:32.077 --> 13:35.491
...fake virgin outfit, and they'd
better not offer me store credit.

13:35.659 --> 13:38.975
- Sorry, Lydia.
- What did Al do?

13:39.115 --> 13:41.603
- Nothing. That's the problem.
- He kept putting it off.

13:41.770 --> 13:44.257
He didn't wanna get married.
I don't know why he proposed.

13:44.426 --> 13:46.565
What's the matter with you guys?

13:46.761 --> 13:49.662
- They're all petrified to make a move.
- It's lack of spine, isn't it?

13:49.865 --> 13:52.199
Whatever you're talking about,
I'm sure you're right.

13:52.361 --> 13:54.727
Mark, I need to talk to you.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.767
Mary. Carol Hathaway in the ER.

13:57.927 --> 14:02.149
I'm not doing to good. One of my
nurses just got floated up to Neuro.

14:02.311 --> 14:05.376
I'm running a department here.
It doesn't benefit my nurses...

14:05.542 --> 14:07.484
...to be shifted
all over the hospital.

14:07.654 --> 14:12.322
No. You know what? She's not going
up. She's not going up to Neuro.

14:12.453 --> 14:14.339
Right. Right.

14:16.931 --> 14:20.989
- Hot stuff.
- Unfortunately, you still have to go.

14:21.187 --> 14:24.000
But this is the last time.
I made an appointment with her.

14:24.162 --> 14:26.234
I'm gonna stop this.

14:26.402 --> 14:29.849
- Hang in there, Lydia.
- Don't worry about me.

14:30.016 --> 14:32.886
You can't put me in the middle
of your conflicts with Weaver.

14:33.057 --> 14:34.998
You can't, because
I'm not gonna be here.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.306
I just trust your judgment.

14:37.472 --> 14:41.627
I know what this is about,
and I'm having a hard time too.

14:41.791 --> 14:45.652
I think we've both been spoiled
by what we have, the shorthand.

14:45.790 --> 14:49.401
- It makes our jobs so much easier.
- Jobs. Right.

14:49.598 --> 14:52.532
In Phoenix, I'm afraid there won't
be a single person in the ER...

14:52.732 --> 14:55.065
...that I can talk to.
- They've got great doctors there.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.261
They have great doctors here.
The best I've ever worked with.

14:58.428 --> 15:01.743
- You can rely on them.
- Thanks for the pep talk.

15:03.643 --> 15:06.642
Mark, is there something else?

15:07.354 --> 15:09.492
No. No, nothing else.

15:09.657 --> 15:12.853
I could ask you
to consult on the hives in 4.

15:13.017 --> 15:15.537
It's time for us
to stand on our own two feet.

15:33.556 --> 15:34.898
Jeanie.

15:36.213 --> 15:37.586
Jeanie.

15:37.747 --> 15:39.886
Jeanie, I'm glad I caught you.

15:40.052 --> 15:42.833
- Did you get the mortgage papers back?
- No, that's what I wanted to tell you.

15:42.995 --> 15:45.930
- AI, you promised.
- I talked to this lawyer.

15:46.067 --> 15:49.361
He gave me some advice. And...

15:49.521 --> 15:51.147
Here.

15:52.464 --> 15:54.253
Everything you said
about our marriage.

15:54.449 --> 15:58.245
About how you carried all the weight.
That's gonna stop.

16:00.495 --> 16:02.829
- What is this?
- Divorce papers.

16:03.022 --> 16:07.146
I'm giving you the house, the car,
everything. And don't say no.

16:07.309 --> 16:08.935
It's not just because
you deserve it.

16:09.102 --> 16:12.233
This guy helped me figure out
that if I get my assets down...

16:12.397 --> 16:14.371
...and showed
that my job has no insurance...

16:14.540 --> 16:18.249
...then I would get this state program
for the working poor.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.418
They offer the drugs I need.
It's a good deal.

16:20.556 --> 16:22.856
But your income has to be
less than $ 15,000 a year.

16:23.018 --> 16:26.401
You don't have to worry
about me anymore. Okay?

16:26.602 --> 16:30.376
You just take care of yourself.
I gotta go.

16:38.567 --> 16:40.640
Settle down. Hold her.

16:40.807 --> 16:42.596
Thank God she was
passed out at Cubbie's.

16:42.759 --> 16:45.278
Bartender got worried after she
downed that sixth double bourbon.

16:45.446 --> 16:48.707
- She looks full-term.
- Let go of me. I'm out of...

16:48.869 --> 16:52.098
No, you're not.
Security! We need Security!

16:52.229 --> 16:55.644
Damn! Damn this damn thing!

16:55.812 --> 16:58.529
Doyle, Ativan, two mg.
Ma'am, are you having contractions?

16:58.724 --> 17:01.276
I need a drink. I need to...

17:01.476 --> 17:04.377
...get out of here!
- Restraints.

17:06.691 --> 17:10.464
You're not going anywhere.
Hold still, so we won't hurt your baby.

17:10.626 --> 17:13.974
Go ahead and kill it.
I never wanted the little bastard.

17:14.145 --> 17:15.965
- Too late to think about that now.
- Just sedate her.

17:16.128 --> 17:20.383
I'll kill myself and take it with me.
Damned thing ruined my life.

17:20.542 --> 17:23.161
- You're pissing me off, lady.
- Hold on, Doyle.

17:23.295 --> 17:25.815
- I wanna die.
- Look out.

17:25.983 --> 17:29.561
Her water broke.
We'd better get her up to OB.

17:30.590 --> 17:32.761
- Fetal alcohol syndrome on the way.
- Need some help?

17:32.925 --> 17:37.528
We could use some muscle here.
Doyle, take her up to OB.

17:37.692 --> 17:41.466
- She was trying to kill her baby.
- Alert Social Services.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.409
- Will they do anything?
- They'll try.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.796
Keep your legs together, honey.

17:47.963 --> 17:50.483
- That was ugly.
- It was criminal.

17:50.651 --> 17:53.333
- Chaplain, got a minute?
- Did you call for the last rites?

17:53.497 --> 17:57.490
No. I wanted to see if you were free
to see this woman. She's in labor.

17:57.624 --> 18:00.853
- Does she want a prayer?
- No. But I think her baby will.

18:01.049 --> 18:04.397
Got a brittle diabetic in 2. He
came in with a glucose level of 406.

18:04.599 --> 18:06.573
- Are you well? You look flushed.
- I'm fine.

18:06.774 --> 18:10.352
He hadn't taken his insulin. His BP
was 210 over 115. Off his dilt.

18:10.518 --> 18:13.681
I gave him both. But he wants to see
Susan. He always sees Dr. Lewis.

18:13.845 --> 18:16.496
- I can take it.
- Okay.

18:16.661 --> 18:20.109
- Where's Dr. Lewis?
- She's busy right now. I'm Dr. Greene.

18:20.276 --> 18:23.341
We've d Ábrided
Mr. Ceebar's ulcerated ankle.

18:23.507 --> 18:27.532
- Do you have an endocrinologist?
- Sort of.

18:27.667 --> 18:31.049
The ER is really not the best place
for you to manage your diabetes.

18:31.218 --> 18:34.632
My ex stole 500 bucks from me.

18:34.833 --> 18:38.826
Upsetting, but still no reason for you
not to monitor your glucose.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.808
I wanted to tell Dr. Lewis.

18:41.969 --> 18:44.335
Well, you can't see her right now.

18:44.496 --> 18:48.106
Diabetes is a serious disease. You can
manage it if you follow the regimen.

18:48.270 --> 18:52.133
But if you neglect it, you're at risk
for kidney failure, blindness...

18:52.302 --> 18:54.789
...and vascular disease.
- Why?

18:54.958 --> 18:58.372
- Why can't I see Dr. Lewis?
- Should I try to find her?

18:58.508 --> 19:03.428
Look, Dr. Lewis is leaving us.
She's not gonna work here anymore.

19:03.596 --> 19:07.044
I didn't tell her about my car.
Somebody ran into it and didn't stop.

19:07.243 --> 19:09.576
- Will you get Psych for Mr. Ceebar?
- I can find Dr...

19:09.770 --> 19:11.680
- Get Psych!
- Tell Dr. Lewis...

19:11.882 --> 19:15.940
Labs came back from the healthmobile.
Can you take a look at this CBC?

19:16.105 --> 19:17.993
- Crit's 28.
- Iron-deficiency anemia?

19:18.153 --> 19:21.348
No. Normal MCV, no blasts. Better
get this kid in for a follow-up.

19:21.512 --> 19:23.651
It's Ahmed Lopez.
The baby that kid brought in.

19:23.816 --> 19:27.263
Charlie? Sisters of Mercy Shelter?
I'll get the number.

19:27.432 --> 19:29.886
I need a hand here.

19:30.055 --> 19:31.877
- What's the problem?
- I never felt better.

19:32.006 --> 19:35.551
The guy's coughing his head off.
Best to bring him here.

19:35.718 --> 19:38.019
- Now it's a crime to cough.
- Shut up and be grateful.

19:38.213 --> 19:41.441
- I'll get a history.
- Cops get stranger all the time.

19:41.604 --> 19:45.215
- Don't worry. This isn't about you.
- Lydia.

19:45.379 --> 19:49.569
- She hates me, doesn't she?
- Well, she's pretty fed up.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.665
I don't know how she got the idea
I didn't wanna get married.

19:52.834 --> 19:56.925
- You kept putting it off.
- That didn't mean I didn't want to.

19:57.090 --> 20:00.285
- I know.
- You wanna be with her, be with her.

20:01.248 --> 20:03.288
Yeah, you're right.

20:03.424 --> 20:06.652
I woke up this morning,
and it was like I was dying.

20:06.815 --> 20:09.052
I couldn't breathe.
You ever get that?

20:09.247 --> 20:11.832
- Yeah.
- I got so crazed.

20:12.030 --> 20:13.885
I tried to get the license.
I drove up to the church.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.762
I tried to drag the priest over here
to marry us right now.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.835
- Lf she'll have me.
- What happened?

20:19.006 --> 20:22.266
They were all at a CPR class.

20:22.428 --> 20:27.283
We do have a chaplain here
in the hospital if you're serious.

20:27.452 --> 20:31.128
- Yeah?
- He's in Trauma 1, giving last rites.

20:37.498 --> 20:40.116
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Look at that.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.801
- Where's the cecum?
- Can't see through all the small bowel.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.684
It's pretty blue in here.
Let's eviscerate.

20:45.848 --> 20:47.570
You wanna take care
of that obstruction?

20:47.735 --> 20:50.223
Sure. Metz. Retractor.

20:50.391 --> 20:52.397
- Look different from a healthy gut?
- I'll say.

20:52.566 --> 20:55.054
Visualize the transduodenal
and peritoneal bands...

20:55.222 --> 20:57.807
...attached to the cecum
and the ascending colon.

20:57.973 --> 21:00.340
- I am.
- I'm putting traction on this mass...

21:00.501 --> 21:02.988
...twisting it counterclockwise.
It's pretty tangled.

21:03.156 --> 21:06.801
- Like a drawer full of socks.
- I have to remember that one.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.931
Okay, it's pinking up.
I don't think we have dead bowel.

21:10.547 --> 21:13.328
- Do you have it?
- Yeah.

21:14.290 --> 21:18.926
- Everything is turned around in here.
- Tell me if you need me.

21:22.353 --> 21:24.076
You better take it.

21:24.752 --> 21:28.134
Okay, retract the intestines. Metz.

21:28.303 --> 21:29.547
Pick up.

21:29.711 --> 21:32.013
Baby's name is Ahmed,
mother's is Gloria.

21:32.175 --> 21:34.181
I don't know what she looks like.

21:34.350 --> 21:37.252
- He doesn't remember the mother.
- He took the blood without consent.

21:37.486 --> 21:38.914
- I didn't hear that.
- That's great, Doug.

21:39.053 --> 21:43.492
I know that all of your residents
are single moms. If you...

21:43.660 --> 21:48.003
Okay, Sister, maybe I will.
Thank you. Thank you.

21:48.204 --> 21:51.400
- Don't ask.
- Don't worry, I won't.

21:51.564 --> 21:55.687
- Has anybody seen Mr. Ceebar?
- Mr. Ceebar. A brittle diabetic?

21:55.851 --> 21:58.087
Yes. Psych is here,
but he's flown the coop.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.315
All he needs is five minutes of TLC
and a cup of hot tea.

22:01.481 --> 22:02.975
Well, he's gone now.

22:03.145 --> 22:06.308
Hey, look at that.

22:06.472 --> 22:08.610
- Think he'll talk her into it?
- Shouldn't be too hard.

22:08.776 --> 22:11.164
- It's what she wants.
- Talk her into what?

22:11.303 --> 22:13.987
Living happily ever after.

22:14.151 --> 22:17.248
- Sorry I couldn't step up.
- At least you knew you weren't ready.

22:17.446 --> 22:19.998
The malrotation was more disorienting
than I expected.

22:20.197 --> 22:23.842
90 percent of correcting a congenital
anomaly is knowing your embryology.

22:24.005 --> 22:27.353
- I had reviewed that.
- Then you had 90 percent aced.

22:27.524 --> 22:30.174
- What was the other 10 percent?
- Being able to stand there...

22:30.339 --> 22:33.405
...and let the confused anatomy
start to make its own sense.

22:33.571 --> 22:35.937
- How?
- By letting it happen.

22:36.098 --> 22:41.051
Abnormalities in neonates can be
overwhelming if broken into parts.

22:41.218 --> 22:43.705
Aristotle would have made
a lousy pediatric surgeon.

22:43.841 --> 22:46.688
Sorry to interrupt. They're calling
us from the ER. They need us.

22:46.848 --> 22:49.499
- What is it?
- A wedding.

22:55.934 --> 22:57.690
Oh, my God! It wasn't a joke.

22:57.854 --> 23:00.275
- Is this crazy?
- Yeah. This is crazy.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.071
Good thing you had
this old rag lying around.

23:02.237 --> 23:04.626
Make it snappy.
They only gave me 20 minutes off.

23:04.797 --> 23:08.211
- This veil is a little crushed.
- I'll go see if the coast is clear.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.485
Hold still. I don't wanna stick you.

23:10.652 --> 23:12.080
- How do we look?
- No traumas coming in.

23:12.251 --> 23:14.323
- Let's go while the radio is silent.
- Am I too late?

23:14.460 --> 23:17.393
No. Right this way.
Bride's side or groom's?

23:21.402 --> 23:24.019
- Okay. They're a little drippy.
- Yeah?

23:24.217 --> 23:26.072
All right, everybody.
They're ready, okay?

23:26.265 --> 23:29.079
Right over there.
That'll be good. Okay, ready?

23:46.229 --> 23:49.611
Dearly beloved...
Friends and colleagues...

23:49.780 --> 23:53.423
...we have come here today
as part of God's eternal plan...

23:53.619 --> 23:55.342
...and on the spur of the moment...

23:55.539 --> 24:00.459
...to this holy place of life
and death and healing...

24:00.626 --> 24:03.974
...to join Lydia Wright and Alfred...

24:04.145 --> 24:05.934
- G... Grabarsky.
- Grabarsky.

24:06.097 --> 24:08.616
Anybody get a stool
culture on Curtain...

24:08.784 --> 24:11.599
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.483
It's okay. I'll go.

24:13.647 --> 24:16.614
I did the rectal swab,
and his chart's in Exam 1.

24:16.783 --> 24:17.798
Best wishes, man.

24:17.935 --> 24:21.414
Like all of us here,
they've chosen as their life's work...

24:21.582 --> 24:24.232
...to care for
and protect their community.

24:24.397 --> 24:27.015
It's taxing and draining.

24:27.213 --> 24:29.383
And at times, it's dangerous work.

24:29.548 --> 24:32.810
Now Lydia and Alfred are taking on
the care and protection...

24:33.004 --> 24:34.564
...for each other
and the love they...

24:34.731 --> 24:37.765
Dr. Benton sends his apologies.
He was called into an emergency.

24:37.931 --> 24:41.279
Today we witness and declare
the sacred union between two...

24:41.450 --> 24:42.792
Testicular torsion.

24:42.954 --> 24:45.288
...souls that feed each other
with that love.

24:45.449 --> 24:48.198
It's a love that sustains
all their outer efforts.

24:48.361 --> 24:51.426
A love that is rare
and that should be treasured.

24:52.872 --> 24:55.620
- A love that at times will glow...
- I need a hand here!

24:55.783 --> 24:59.361
...and yet at other times,
it will flicker.

24:59.559 --> 25:01.216
And now the vows.

25:01.414 --> 25:03.388
Do you Lydia take Alfred...

25:03.590 --> 25:06.622
...to love and cherish from this day
forward till death do you part?

25:06.789 --> 25:10.618
- I do.
- And you Alfred take Lydia...

25:10.788 --> 25:14.585
...to love and cherish from this day
forward till death do you part?

25:14.756 --> 25:16.348
I do.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.904
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

25:19.811 --> 25:22.395
You may kiss your bride.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.028
Then he just handed you
the divorce papers?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.884
- It wasn't like him.
- What do you mean?

25:30.081 --> 25:31.902
It's the most unselfish thing
he's ever done.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.333
- She's throwing the bouquet.
- Come on.

25:34.496 --> 25:36.567
No pushing now. Come on.

25:36.735 --> 25:41.274
- Hey, Carol. It's bouquet time.
- No, thank you.

25:41.438 --> 25:43.772
Should we do the goodbye for Susan
now while everyone's here?

25:43.934 --> 25:46.422
No. We'll do it in an hour or so.

25:46.590 --> 25:49.174
- Did you see those two?
- You see them during the ceremony?

25:49.341 --> 25:51.730
It's pathetic.
I figured those two'd make a go of it.

25:51.900 --> 25:55.129
- Best friends. What more do you want?
- Not me. It's what Mark wants.

25:55.260 --> 25:58.161
- Things happen or not for a reason.
- Why is she leaving?

25:58.331 --> 26:00.022
She doesn't have a life here.

26:00.187 --> 26:03.317
And one, two, three!

26:04.218 --> 26:07.120
Oh, my God!

26:07.321 --> 26:09.426
- Oh, yeah, Susan!
- Yeah!

26:11.385 --> 26:14.034
Congratulations!

26:14.199 --> 26:15.955
- You're next.
- Yeah, funny.

26:16.119 --> 26:20.821
- That was kind of great, huh?
- Yeah. They seem happy.

26:20.983 --> 26:22.891
Hey, Mark...

26:23.062 --> 26:26.411
...I proved I'm no good at goodbyes.
- Me neither.

26:26.550 --> 26:30.062
- I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier.
- I just don't want to go...

26:30.229 --> 26:32.498
...unless I know
we'll always be friends.

26:32.661 --> 26:34.667
We will.

26:39.571 --> 26:41.872
- You ready for me?
- Come on in. Almost there.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.935
Why don't you shut the door?

26:48.977 --> 26:51.660
So about your literature review.

26:51.825 --> 26:55.599
It's very complete.
I have a few quibbles about emphasis.

26:55.760 --> 27:00.102
I'm not sure that Ladd warrants
an entire paragraph.

27:00.239 --> 27:03.534
- Probably not.
- But you have a very nice style.

27:03.695 --> 27:07.077
- Easy to read, not a lot of jargon.
- Thank you.

27:08.718 --> 27:11.564
I would ask you to co-author
if you weren't first-year.

27:11.757 --> 27:15.650
We need to be careful and not draw
a lot of attention considering...

27:15.820 --> 27:17.347
- Considering us?
- Yes.

27:17.516 --> 27:21.159
And what happened last Thursday
and Saturday afternoon and evening?

27:21.323 --> 27:24.040
- Yes. And Tuesday before rounds.
- We can talk about that.

27:24.203 --> 27:27.650
The only thing we need to keep
straight is that this is separate.

27:27.818 --> 27:29.792
- Completely separate.
- From my work.

27:29.929 --> 27:32.263
It shouldn't matter.
I'm not your boss.

27:32.425 --> 27:35.076
- You're my boss's boss.
- Did you lock the door?

27:35.240 --> 27:38.622
Just so we both understand
that this is strictly personal.

27:38.824 --> 27:42.084
It has nothing to do with work.
Oh, I love that.

27:42.279 --> 27:44.996
There are so many things
I'm not gonna miss about this place.

27:45.159 --> 27:48.005
Aftercare documentation
is one of them.

27:48.165 --> 27:50.783
I can't tell you how many hours
I've spent doing this.

27:50.949 --> 27:53.851
- You're the only one who ever bothers.
- You kidding me?

27:54.020 --> 27:56.092
Yeah.

27:56.260 --> 27:58.529
- She's gonna leave at 2:00.
- Are they setting up?

27:58.692 --> 28:00.099
In the lounge.

28:00.260 --> 28:02.812
I got a call from the D.A. Today...

28:02.947 --> 28:06.329
...about a drunk woman
who came in in labor.

28:06.497 --> 28:08.766
They're charging her
for attempted murder.

28:08.962 --> 28:12.889
- Social Services jumped on that one.
- They're acting on a call from us.

28:13.089 --> 28:15.456
You've seen that
crayon-in-the-nose trick before?

28:15.648 --> 28:18.014
Doctor, the address
for Sisters of Mercy.

28:18.208 --> 28:20.445
Yeah. We can handle it together.

28:20.608 --> 28:24.152
Dr. Doyle, did you make a call
to the 32nd Precinct today?

28:24.319 --> 28:26.969
Yeah. I got a cousin there.

28:27.517 --> 28:29.492
She wanted to kill her baby.
I was a witness.

28:29.662 --> 28:31.964
We get a lot of women here
with alcohol and drug problems.

28:32.125 --> 28:35.638
- We let Social Services handle it.
- It can fall through the cracks.

28:35.773 --> 28:39.220
Initiating criminal investigation
wasn't your job.

28:39.387 --> 28:41.460
But protecting the health of the baby.
Is that my job?

28:41.659 --> 28:44.408
We won't improve
prenatal care for high-risk infants...

28:44.571 --> 28:46.775
...if we scare off the mothers.
- How about this?

28:46.939 --> 28:51.094
If I get to testify against the bitch,
I'll do it on my own time.

28:51.257 --> 28:53.558
I think we're gonna like her.

28:53.721 --> 28:56.623
Randi, could you
try and find me some aspirin?

28:56.793 --> 29:00.272
It doesn't work for us. We never had
floats in and out of the department.

29:00.440 --> 29:04.083
- Budgets are tight, Carol.
- We're all aware of that.

29:04.246 --> 29:06.385
The hospital values
its registered nurses.

29:06.518 --> 29:10.827
RNs are the best trained and most
versatile part of the nursing staff.

29:10.998 --> 29:14.892
We are also the most
expensive part of that staff.

29:15.093 --> 29:19.402
County has got to figure out ways
to utilize RNs more effectively.

29:19.603 --> 29:23.629
- At least have the floats make sense.
- Go on.

29:24.211 --> 29:26.829
ER and ICU have
more skills in common...

29:26.995 --> 29:29.896
...than ward nurses,
Recovery or Neuro.

29:30.066 --> 29:32.171
That's a very good point, Carol.

29:32.337 --> 29:35.632
That is precisely why
I keep trying to get you managers...

29:35.793 --> 29:38.444
...who are in the trenches,
more active on the committees.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.991
- We need your perspective.
- Mary, I'm swamped.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.883
Okay, how about a deal?

29:44.047 --> 29:47.046
I can find ER floats
to ICU per your suggestion.

29:47.247 --> 29:50.628
In exchange, you sit on the hospital-
wide re-engineering committee.

29:50.830 --> 29:53.317
We only meet once a month.

29:58.125 --> 30:02.183
- I stalled her with one last patient.
- Good. She was out the door.

30:02.348 --> 30:04.420
Mr. Frick will keep her busy
for a while.

30:04.588 --> 30:07.489
- You got any tape?
- Yeah. Is Mark coming?

30:07.659 --> 30:10.854
- I beeped him twice.
- Sorry, folks. MVA coming in.

30:10.986 --> 30:14.498
Kindergarten carpool
versus joy-riding teens.

30:14.665 --> 30:17.960
- Could be as many as eight victims.
- There goes the party.

30:18.121 --> 30:20.739
- What's the ETA?
- They're pulling up now.

30:20.935 --> 30:22.878
Let's go. Come on.

30:25.064 --> 30:27.649
That's me.
Runner-up for Mr. Universe.

30:27.815 --> 30:31.130
Call me a fool, doc.
But I'm betting on a comeback.

30:31.302 --> 30:34.084
Haven't changed a lick since 1947.

30:34.246 --> 30:37.540
I'm afraid you may have lost
too much weight recently.

30:37.700 --> 30:40.929
I'm in training. Midwestern finals.

30:41.092 --> 30:44.670
American bodybuilders. 70 and older.

30:46.116 --> 30:48.090
Gotta take care of this damn sciatica.

30:48.258 --> 30:51.934
- Oh, man. That smarts.
- Why don't you take a seat again?

30:52.097 --> 30:56.091
- Do you know how this happened?
- My B-12 shot. Must have hit a nerve.

30:56.258 --> 31:00.086
- You're injecting vitamins?
- I stay clear of steroids.

31:00.257 --> 31:02.361
That's good. Scoot back.

31:02.528 --> 31:06.205
Press against my hands.
Yeah, good.

31:06.368 --> 31:09.563
- Any other complaints?
- No. Best I've looked in 10 years.

31:09.726 --> 31:14.297
- When's the competition?
- Mid-March. I'll be 74 by then.

31:14.429 --> 31:16.469
- And ready for a comeback.
- You think?

31:16.638 --> 31:21.426
Yeah. Plenty of bed rest, anti-
inflammatories and start back slowly.

31:22.653 --> 31:24.986
- Thanks, doc.
- Okay.

31:29.082 --> 31:30.905
- Fractured tib-fib.
- Honey, you're gonna be fine.

31:31.067 --> 31:32.889
Order a portable C-spine
and left tib-fib.

31:33.051 --> 31:36.116
Come with me this way.
I'll find you a place to sit.

31:36.282 --> 31:40.023
- My mom and dad are gonna kill me.
- I'll tell them it was my fault.

32:08.531 --> 32:12.971
- Signing out, Randi.
- Thanks. Good luck in Phoenix.

32:13.138 --> 32:16.912
No. This is the ER again.
We need a neurosurgeon now!

32:18.033 --> 32:22.189
Get him to the Suture Room.
Set me up with some 4.0 nylon.

32:23.313 --> 32:25.733
You have a ruptured spleen.
You need surgery.

32:25.936 --> 32:28.489
It's my carpool.
All the parents need to be called.

32:28.687 --> 32:31.621
Randi, come here
and take these numbers down.

32:31.822 --> 32:34.408
- I told you not to let him drive.
- He told me he knew how.

32:34.575 --> 32:36.963
- We were just goofing around.
- Hush! Hold still.

32:37.133 --> 32:39.522
Complains of chest pains,
shortness of breath.

32:39.693 --> 32:42.081
Diminished breath sounds on the left.
Get me a chest-tube tray.

32:42.253 --> 32:44.489
We need an abdominal CT
for the kid in Trauma 1.

32:44.652 --> 32:48.263
- BP's coming down. 190 over 130.
- Poor cap refill. Pulse ox 90.

32:48.428 --> 32:51.242
Type and cross two units.
O-neg on the rapid infuser.

32:51.370 --> 32:54.305
- X-ray's coming for the C-spine.
- Anybody need any help?

32:54.475 --> 32:59.394
- Susan, what are you still doing here?
- You're gonna miss your train.

32:59.594 --> 33:01.633
- Call us.
- Get some O-negative too.

33:01.832 --> 33:04.254
BP's 200 over 140.
Left pupil's sluggish.

33:04.456 --> 33:06.790
- Dusky, you wanna intubate?
- Yes.

33:06.983 --> 33:09.853
7.0 ET tube.

33:10.023 --> 33:12.543
Possible subdural hematoma.

33:12.711 --> 33:17.532
Mannitol, 90 grams IV.
Let's hyperventilate him. All right?

33:19.653 --> 33:21.954
- Here you go.
- Okay.

33:22.084 --> 33:24.189
Use suction if you need it.

33:30.179 --> 33:32.634
Take your time.
He's breathing on his own.

33:35.010 --> 33:39.068
- She didn't even leave a note.
- She was saying goodbye all day.

33:39.234 --> 33:42.136
- One of the kids crashed in Radiology.
- Which one?

33:42.305 --> 33:44.508
- The fractured tib-fib.
- How did it happen?

33:44.672 --> 33:46.614
If it's okay, I'd love
to get out of here by 7.

33:46.784 --> 33:50.580
- You working on the literature review?
- No. I got a date.

33:50.752 --> 33:53.620
Don't procrastinate and keep Keaton
waiting. It reflects poorly on me.

33:53.758 --> 33:56.092
- She's a hard one to get, isn't she?
- How do you figure?

33:56.255 --> 33:58.741
She's a great surgeon,
but not much of a teacher.

33:58.909 --> 34:01.527
- You don't think so?
- Come on. All that psychobabble?

34:01.726 --> 34:05.173
- Her explanations can be eccentric.
- She doesn't say what she wants.

34:05.372 --> 34:09.462
Sometimes she does. But I haven't
been working with her like you have.

34:09.627 --> 34:13.521
She's soft.
She doesn't act like a surgeon.

34:13.690 --> 34:17.433
It is difficult to learn from someone
who teaches by intuition.

34:17.594 --> 34:19.415
Which I appreciate
about your teaching.

34:19.577 --> 34:21.399
Excuse me, Carter. Carla?

34:22.297 --> 34:24.663
There you are.
I've been here for half an hour.

34:24.824 --> 34:26.068
Why?

34:26.199 --> 34:28.983
- Kingston Mines. Dinner?
- That's tomorrow night.

34:29.143 --> 34:31.697
- No, that's tonight.
- Anything you need?

34:31.862 --> 34:34.830
- No, Carter. I'm sorry.
- Carla, this is Dr. Carter.

34:35.030 --> 34:37.714
- Carter, this is Carla Reece.
- Pleased to meet you.

34:37.878 --> 34:40.212
I'm sorry.
I'm on till midnight tonight.

34:40.406 --> 34:42.827
This is where you work until midnight.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.779
- I'll walk you to your car.
- You've never been here?

34:45.940 --> 34:48.329
- No, I haven't.
- I should give you a tour.

34:48.501 --> 34:51.315
- She's got plans.
- No. I've been stood up.

34:51.476 --> 34:53.679
If Trauma 1 is open,
we could start there.

34:53.844 --> 34:57.901
- Don't show me anything bloody.
- No, no. What do you do, Carla?

34:58.034 --> 35:01.230
- I have this Caribbean restaurant.
- No kidding?

35:01.393 --> 35:04.459
My family used to sail
to the islands every spring.

35:05.936 --> 35:07.463
Half day Dr. Ross?

35:07.664 --> 35:09.671
I was immunizing when you
were hitting the snooze button.

35:09.873 --> 35:12.872
I'm upset because I don't understand
how you could send a surgical...

35:13.039 --> 35:15.341
I asked if I should send him
for a CT. You said, "Go ahead."

35:15.503 --> 35:18.284
- I assumed he was stable.
- No, I asked for your call.

35:18.447 --> 35:20.867
You weren't listening.
You were distracted.

35:21.038 --> 35:24.136
You were looking for Susan,
worried she'd left. I understand.

35:24.301 --> 35:25.926
But don't yell at me now.

35:26.092 --> 35:29.256
Mark, grab your coat. Let's go talk.

35:30.444 --> 35:33.312
- Admin actually listened?
- So no more floating?

35:33.483 --> 35:35.109
You laid down the law.

35:35.276 --> 35:38.242
They won't be sending you
to Neuro or the wards anymore.

35:38.442 --> 35:40.231
They're gonna limit
our floats to ICU.

35:40.394 --> 35:42.913
- How's that any better?
- Similar nursing skills.

35:43.114 --> 35:44.837
We have to get it in our contract.

35:45.001 --> 35:48.262
- Only way they'll respect us.
- They'll never respect us.

35:48.424 --> 35:50.464
Dr. Weaver is wondering
where the nurses are.

35:50.633 --> 35:53.479
I don't think it's so
bad floating to I.C.U.

35:53.639 --> 35:55.549
- I'm not going.
- They won't send you.

35:55.719 --> 35:57.628
You're not close enough
to your 20 years.

35:57.798 --> 36:00.995
It's a compromise, but it's
better than what was happening.

36:01.126 --> 36:05.762
Careful, Carol. You sound
an awful lot like management.

36:05.925 --> 36:08.608
- I didn't even say goodbye.
- That's not what you need to tell her.

36:08.804 --> 36:10.812
- Too late now.
- When does her train leave?

36:11.012 --> 36:14.459
- 4:20.
- Under one hour. They're usually late.

36:14.659 --> 36:19.099
- She went home to get her luggage.
- I'm on till 11.

36:19.266 --> 36:21.819
- You think I should just go?
- You could.

36:21.986 --> 36:25.563
It's impossible. She's getting
on a train. She's made up her mind.

36:25.729 --> 36:27.769
It may be. But that's not the point.

36:29.248 --> 36:32.248
- What would I say now?
- What you wanted to for years.

36:32.417 --> 36:34.554
You tell her how you feel or...

36:34.688 --> 36:37.949
...let her go without a word and
regret it for the rest of your life.

36:38.111 --> 36:41.012
And make yourself and everybody
else around you miserable...

36:41.214 --> 36:43.831
...like you have today.

36:44.734 --> 36:46.839
You're right.

36:47.422 --> 36:50.170
- Wait. Can you tell Kerry...?
- Go, go, go!

36:52.444 --> 36:55.705
This is great. Oh, my goodness!

36:55.867 --> 36:59.314
- Is this where you operate on them?
- We stabilize them here.

36:59.482 --> 37:03.476
- Then we send them upstairs to the O.R.
- Speaking of upstairs.

37:03.642 --> 37:07.154
- Nice meeting you, Carla.
- Yes, thank you for showing me around.

37:07.289 --> 37:11.117
- What's in here?
- Just the Suture Room.

37:11.288 --> 37:12.717
What goes on in here?

37:12.920 --> 37:16.432
We just take patients
down here that we need to...

37:25.589 --> 37:29.812
You're gonna mess up
my reputation around here.

37:29.973 --> 37:33.267
I've been wanting to do that
since I came into this place.

37:33.428 --> 37:35.729
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

37:35.891 --> 37:38.641
I'm sorry I got to work late.

37:38.771 --> 37:41.421
Well, there's late and...

37:41.586 --> 37:43.822
...there's later.

38:16.875 --> 38:18.402
Taxi!

38:20.939 --> 38:22.694
Pull up.

38:48.069 --> 38:49.792
Susan?

38:51.238 --> 38:53.757
- Suse, are you here?
- Dr. Greene. You just missed her.

38:53.956 --> 38:57.055
She left you a note on the mantel.

39:05.506 --> 39:08.985
- Is that clock right, Sister?
- Oh, yes.

39:09.153 --> 39:11.935
I must be slow. I got a friend
trying to catch a train.

39:12.098 --> 39:14.780
Sister Anne, try to get them to share.

39:14.912 --> 39:16.985
We haven't had a Lopez all month.

39:17.153 --> 39:21.046
- It's a mother and an infant.
- I know, doctor. I'm sorry.

39:21.247 --> 39:24.312
You could leave a note on the board.

40:00.791 --> 40:02.766
Go! Go! Go, man!

40:41.487 --> 40:43.592
Southwest train.

40:44.495 --> 40:46.350
Track 10.

40:59.788 --> 41:04.065
Looking for the chief, sir?
She got moved. Track 6.

41:07.115 --> 41:08.969
Susan!

41:09.130 --> 41:10.690
Susan!

41:13.577 --> 41:14.984
Susan!

41:16.073 --> 41:17.665
Susan! Susan!

41:17.832 --> 41:20.320
- All aboard!
- Susan!

41:21.544 --> 41:23.779
Mark? Are you okay?

41:24.743 --> 41:28.037
- You came to say goodbye?
- No. Stay.

41:28.198 --> 41:30.401
I want you to stay.

41:30.598 --> 41:32.605
- But, Mark...
- I love you.

41:32.806 --> 41:36.383
And I'm stupid
for not saying it before.

41:36.549 --> 41:38.620
No. It's okay. I knew.

41:38.788 --> 41:42.269
- In a way, I knew.
- Aboard!

41:42.436 --> 41:45.469
Stay. We belong together.

41:46.851 --> 41:49.119
Tell me you don't feel the same.

41:53.698 --> 41:56.567
I'm sorry.

41:56.737 --> 41:58.744
Train's leaving, ma'am.

41:58.913 --> 42:01.814
- We're right together.
- Mark...

42:02.016 --> 42:05.277
...you're my best friend. I don't
know how I'll make it without you.

42:05.471 --> 42:08.505
- Don't go.
- I have to.

42:08.671 --> 42:13.143
I don't belong here. I have a new
life going in a different direction.

42:13.310 --> 42:15.862
Susan, I don't wanna lose you.

42:28.603 --> 42:32.432
- Ma'am, we're leaving.
- I'll never forget you.

42:36.088 --> 42:38.161
- I do love you.
- What?

42:38.361 --> 42:41.677
I love you!

42:43.000 --> 42:44.724
Bye.
