00:01.830 --> 00:03.798
Man: How do you feel?

00:03.800 --> 00:05.290
Different man:
I feel better.

00:05.300 --> 00:06.699
We're out of time,

00:06.700 --> 00:08.134
But I-I want
you to think

00:08.140 --> 00:10.791
About the expectations
that you place on people.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.666
I think you'll find
some patterns emerging.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.739
Yeah, yeah. I will.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.139
Good session.
Yeah.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.748
I, uh, I think we're
cracking away

00:22.750 --> 00:24.479
At your anxiety.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.549
Good. Yeah.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.585
Good-bye.

00:37.070 --> 00:38.959

00:46.310 --> 00:49.871
Phillip, did you
forget something?

01:07.630 --> 01:09.519
[click]

01:17.540 --> 01:19.804
Who's out there?

01:34.820 --> 01:36.811
[door creaks]

01:47.570 --> 01:49.459
[thump]

03:14.160 --> 03:17.357
First, you receive
an unsigned sympathy card

03:17.360 --> 03:19.954
With a clipping of your
sister and then this?

03:19.960 --> 03:23.396
Someone's trying to tell
me they know about my past.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.370
That bear was in a box
in my closet for years.

03:26.370 --> 03:29.237
How would anyone know
it was there?

03:29.240 --> 03:31.038
They've been
inside my house.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.508
Have you called
the security company?

03:32.510 --> 03:34.239
Yeah, I did.
I changed the locks,

03:34.240 --> 03:36.709
I got a new code.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.680
Tracy, you're the only one
who had my old passcode.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.512
I've given it
to no one.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.409
Where do you keep
the information?

03:43.420 --> 03:46.139
In my contacts,
but it's password-protected.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.150
You know this.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.582
Yeah. I know.
I just--

03:48.590 --> 03:52.458
I'm just trying to figure out how
somebody got into my home.

03:52.460 --> 03:57.057
Well, there's no way they got
the information from me.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.868
Where's ray?

03:58.870 --> 04:00.998
Has he been released?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.695
No. I called
the hospital in seattle.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.929
He's still
institutionalized.

04:04.940 --> 04:09.332
Have you talked about this
with your colleagues?

04:09.350 --> 04:12.103
Beth, you have to
investigate this.

04:12.110 --> 04:13.339
It's what you do.

04:13.350 --> 04:16.320
I know. I will.
I just--

04:16.320 --> 04:18.310
It's complicated
at work.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.084
No one knows
about me.

04:20.089 --> 04:22.855
[cell phone ringing]

04:25.890 --> 04:27.289
Hello?

04:27.300 --> 04:29.120
And how are you
today?

04:29.130 --> 04:30.120
As tired as I am?

04:30.130 --> 04:32.269
Um, brody, I can't
talk right now.

04:32.270 --> 04:33.795
Can I call you back?

04:33.800 --> 04:35.894
Sure. Is
everything ok?

04:35.900 --> 04:37.334
Yeah. I just
can't talk.

04:37.340 --> 04:41.607
I'll ring you back,
and, yes, I'm exhausted.

04:41.610 --> 04:43.430
Bye.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.910
So things are good
with you and brody?

04:48.920 --> 04:51.446
Yeah. I mean,
it is what it is.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.384
Does he have access
to your phone?

04:53.390 --> 04:55.017
It's password-protected.

04:55.020 --> 04:56.681
Brody doesn't
even know you.

04:56.690 --> 04:58.522
How well do you
know him?

04:58.530 --> 04:59.986
Seriously?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.729
I'm sorry.

05:01.730 --> 05:04.358
This whole thing,
I'm on edge.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.327
Beth, I am here for you.
I always will be,

05:06.340 --> 05:07.660
But I'm not
the police.

05:07.670 --> 05:10.492
It's time for you to talk
to someone about this.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.536
This is scary stuff.
Please.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.572
Ok.

05:47.580 --> 05:51.369
Janice: Beth, I have dr. Adam
lewis in the conference room.

05:51.380 --> 05:53.803
He's a psychiatrist,
says he's being harassed

05:53.820 --> 05:55.618
By one of his patients.

05:55.620 --> 05:57.475
You take it.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.743
Sure. Is everything
all right?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.580
Yeah. Why wouldn't
it be?

06:01.590 --> 06:04.355
You seem anxious,
preoccupied.

06:04.360 --> 06:08.092
I thought the psychiatrist
was in the conference room.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.660
I'm sorry.
Work hazard.

06:10.670 --> 06:11.990
It's fine. I'm busy
today, janice.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.061
Can you run point
and have ben assist you?

06:15.070 --> 06:17.869
You got it.
Ok.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.576
I didn't see
who left it.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.048
But you have someone
in mind.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.518
There is a patient
who is fixated on me.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.387
She's actually been
stalking me for a while now.

06:32.390 --> 06:33.744
Why didn't you
report it before?

06:33.760 --> 06:35.455
I was reluctant.
I've never revealed

06:35.460 --> 06:36.609
A patient's name before.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.621
You're aware of the
tarasoff exception

06:38.630 --> 06:39.529
To confidentiality.

06:39.530 --> 06:40.929
If you believe she
poses a threat,

06:40.930 --> 06:42.125
You're obligated
to do so.

06:42.130 --> 06:44.428
Which is why
I'm here now.

06:44.430 --> 06:45.568
Tell us
about your patient.

06:45.570 --> 06:47.595
Perhaps we can
determine that for you.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.432
It started as
a simple crush,

06:49.440 --> 06:51.636
One-sided
flirtatious banter.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.530
She began to dress
for our sessions.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.575
I dealt with it directly.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.571
We created boundaries,
which she couldn't keep.

06:57.580 --> 07:01.278
She began leaving
excessive messages,

07:01.280 --> 07:02.679
Cards, gifts.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.081
There's a disturbing video
message in there, also.

07:05.090 --> 07:07.980
She began dropping by the
office at unscheduled times.

07:07.990 --> 07:11.722
Then two weeks ago,
my wife and I--vanessa--

07:11.730 --> 07:13.152
We took a vacation
to phoenix,

07:13.160 --> 07:14.889
And she showed up
at our hotel.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.026
Did she make
contact?

07:16.030 --> 07:17.452
I was supposed to meet
my wife at the pool.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.268
When I arrived,
she had befriended my wife.

07:19.270 --> 07:23.036
They were chatting. She acted
innocent and surprised to see me,

07:23.040 --> 07:24.906
But it was obvious
she'd followed me there.

07:24.910 --> 07:27.868
How did your
wife take it?

07:27.880 --> 07:30.770
I had to tell her
the truth of course,

07:30.780 --> 07:33.408
And she wasn't happy.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.446
She thought there might
be more to it.

07:36.450 --> 07:38.748
We've been having
some issues.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.548
Nonrelated
to your patient?

07:40.560 --> 07:42.119
Yes. It's a marriage.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.110
We have peaks and valleys,

07:43.130 --> 07:45.087
And we're in a bit
of a valley right now.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.651
Why would you keep seeing her
after you followed you to phoenix?

07:48.660 --> 07:51.152
Transference is not
uncommon in psychotherapy.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.524
I thought we could
work through it.

07:52.530 --> 07:54.931
I did warn her that if
there was another violation

07:54.940 --> 07:57.989
I would be forced to hand
her off to another therapist.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.364
So after what
happened last night,

07:59.370 --> 08:01.634
You terminated her
as a patient.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.904
No. I decided
to come here.

08:03.910 --> 08:06.971
Her behavior is escalating,
it's accelerating.

08:06.980 --> 08:10.143
And you're worried that the
rejection of being dumped

08:10.150 --> 08:12.915
As a patient could
potentially turn her violent.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.480
We're gonna need
a name, dr. Lewis.

08:15.490 --> 08:19.222
You're justified in
breaking privilege.

08:19.230 --> 08:21.358
What's her name?

08:26.100 --> 08:28.592
It's claudia burke.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.602
What does claudia
suffer from?

08:32.610 --> 08:34.135
Claudia is
a paranoid schizophrenic

08:34.140 --> 08:37.633
With auditory
hallucinations.

08:40.950 --> 08:43.270
I wrote you a song.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.543
I want to play it,
but first, you need to know

08:45.550 --> 08:50.511
That it was inspired
by your eyes,

08:50.530 --> 08:54.285
A soft blue like
the ocean.

08:54.300 --> 08:58.362
Stop it. No.
He won't like that.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.168
It's too cheesy.

09:00.170 --> 09:03.959
No. No. Adam--adam
likes romance.

09:03.970 --> 09:07.531
He needs to know
how I feel, so...

09:09.080 --> 09:11.333
I love you.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.670
There! I said it,

09:12.680 --> 09:17.550
And you need to know that--
be quiet, please.

09:17.550 --> 09:19.712
Be quiet. This--this
is very--

09:19.720 --> 09:23.054
Very, very important,
and you're trying to ruin it.

09:23.060 --> 09:25.620
What if he just
doesn't know?

09:25.630 --> 09:29.055
Well, what if he
loves me, too, and I'm--

09:29.060 --> 09:31.859
Please love me, too.

09:31.870 --> 09:36.432
Please, dr. Lewis.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.738
Damn it! Stop it!

09:38.740 --> 09:40.902
Jack: She's
hearing voices?

09:40.910 --> 09:42.776
Schizophrenic.

09:42.780 --> 09:43.872
Who is she?

09:43.880 --> 09:45.871
Claudia burke,
music major at usc

09:45.880 --> 09:48.417
Until she was forced to
drop out due to low grades.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.013
Stopped taking
her meds.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.613
Janice: You have
an address?

09:51.620 --> 09:53.088
Yeah.

09:53.090 --> 09:54.649
Want to take
a field trip?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.754
Sure. Why not?

09:59.360 --> 10:01.180
No. I didn't want to go.

10:01.200 --> 10:05.990
I'll just sit here
and do...Stuff.

10:17.410 --> 10:20.141

10:22.280 --> 10:25.682

10:25.690 --> 10:26.714

10:26.720 --> 10:29.781
She made sure nobody
could spy on her.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.259
Door's unlocked.

10:33.260 --> 10:35.126
Your case, your call.

10:35.130 --> 10:38.156
We could justify entering
on a wellness check.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.195
Works for me.

10:46.570 --> 10:48.334
Claudia burke?

10:48.340 --> 10:50.229
[muffled voices on tv]

10:50.250 --> 10:53.800
We're detectives
with the lapd.

11:19.610 --> 11:21.567
Claudia?

11:34.690 --> 11:37.284
I'm gonna check
upstairs.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.339
She's still alive.

13:36.340 --> 13:38.547
I got her.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.507
Call an ambulance.

[coughing]

13:52.730 --> 13:56.689
A card
and a teddy bear.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.566
Did you run
forensics on them?

13:58.570 --> 14:01.267
They haven't been
processed, no.

14:01.270 --> 14:02.760
Why not?

14:02.770 --> 14:04.659
It's an abuse of power
and a drain

14:04.670 --> 14:06.035
On department resources.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.462
Are you saying that
my detectives

14:07.480 --> 14:09.778
Don't deserve
the same protections

14:09.780 --> 14:10.872
We afford our citizens?

14:10.880 --> 14:12.769
Diane, no one's
done more for me--

14:12.780 --> 14:15.044
I am responsible for
the safety and welfare

14:15.050 --> 14:17.940
Of all my detectives,
not just you.

14:17.950 --> 14:20.282
This is
preferential treatment.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.542
Could be nothing.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.258
Ok. Who else knows
about your real identity?

14:25.260 --> 14:27.149
In los angeles,
one friend.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.356
In seattle,
I left no ties.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.226
The court records
were sealed.

14:31.230 --> 14:34.689
The only man who could be doing
this that we know of is locked up.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.930
All right. I am gonna
call seattle,

14:36.940 --> 14:38.931
Talk to the detective
who handled your case,

14:38.940 --> 14:41.102
See if anybody's
been snooping around.

14:41.110 --> 14:42.475
Thank you.
But don't rule out

14:42.480 --> 14:44.278
The possibility
of a new threat.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.247
It's not unusual.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.843
Every detective who
works for the tau

14:46.850 --> 14:49.569
Has been stalked by
somebody they've investigated.

14:49.580 --> 14:51.378
I'm sorry to bother
you with this.

14:51.390 --> 14:55.111
After you pushed my background
check through the academy,

14:55.120 --> 14:57.418
I promised that I would
never ask for another favor.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.650
It's not a favor.
It's a viable threat

15:00.660 --> 15:02.992
Against one
of my officers.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.092
Run forensics.

15:04.100 --> 15:08.059
It's not a suggestion.
It's an order.

15:10.970 --> 15:13.803
[heart monitor beeping]

15:20.310 --> 15:21.106

- I'm detective
janice lawrence.

15:22.480 --> 15:26.587
I'm with the threat
assessment unit of the lapd.

15:26.590 --> 15:29.480
What happened?

15:29.490 --> 15:30.719
Why am I tied down?

15:30.730 --> 15:33.381
It's ok. It's for,
your own protection.

15:33.400 --> 15:37.655
You're lying.
Let me go, untie me.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.321
Let's talk first.
Can we?

15:40.340 --> 15:41.967
No one's gonna hurt you.

15:41.970 --> 15:43.369
You're safe here,

15:43.370 --> 15:45.930
But you just had
a very close call.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.362
What are you
talking about?

15:47.380 --> 15:51.237
What do you remember,
claudia?

15:51.250 --> 15:53.571
Uh...I was home.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.412
I was about to
start cooking.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.115
Everyone was hungry,
so I--

15:57.120 --> 15:57.973
Everyone?

15:57.990 --> 16:03.053
Yes. Jean-ann, billy,
leslie, ricky,

16:03.060 --> 16:04.755
Aunt melanie.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.922
It was time to eat.

16:06.930 --> 16:09.024
Undo these, please.
They hurt.

16:09.030 --> 16:11.556
Where are these people?

16:11.570 --> 16:12.799
Home.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.338
Yes. I believe
I met them.

16:16.340 --> 16:18.809
What were you doing
in my house?

16:18.810 --> 16:21.336
You're not allowed
to be there.

16:21.340 --> 16:22.569
Were you spying
on me?

16:22.580 --> 16:24.901
No. I was concerned
about you,

16:24.910 --> 16:26.071
And I was right to be.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.606
I'm the one who found
you in the garage.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.942
I didn't--I didn't
go in the garage today.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.715
You left a note
in the car, claudia.

16:34.720 --> 16:39.328
You were trying
to hurt yourself.

16:39.330 --> 16:40.729
No.

16:40.730 --> 16:46.260
We found the note that
you left for dr. Lewis,

16:46.270 --> 16:49.399
Telling him that it was
his fault, he drove you to it.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.698
It's not true!
I never wrote that.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.769
So you never left
him gifts,

16:53.780 --> 16:55.407
Followed him to phoenix?

16:55.410 --> 16:56.900
You're not in love
with him?

16:56.910 --> 17:02.417
I-I did those things, but
he told me to stop, and I did.

17:02.420 --> 17:03.478
I was being good.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.617
Not last night.
You went to his office.

17:05.619 --> 17:06.883
That wasn't me.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.415
Then who was it?

17:08.420 --> 17:12.084
The same person who wrote
that phony suicide note.

17:12.089 --> 17:13.854
I was home.
You can ask my neighbors.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.896
I got into a nasty
argument with them.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.891
They don't properly
bag their garbage.

17:17.900 --> 17:21.494
It creates this
cat problem.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.036
Don't talk to me now.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.702
She doesn't understand.

17:25.710 --> 17:27.337
I never wrote that note.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.434
I write everything
by hand.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.239
You have to feel
the words.

17:32.250 --> 17:35.709
You can't do that
with a computer.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.856
What's the last thing
that you remember?

17:46.860 --> 17:51.422
I was talking to Jesus when
someone came up behind me

17:51.430 --> 17:53.819
In my kitchen
and grabbed me.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.434
Everything went black,
and I woke up here.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.159
<i>I thought it was billy
or ting, but it wasn't.</i>

17:59.170 --> 18:01.207
You know, they say
it was a stranger.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.372
Do people attack you
all the time.

18:03.380 --> 18:04.939
Usually just with words.

18:04.950 --> 18:08.773
This is the first time
they've ever left bruises.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.956
We investigated
claudia's claims, expecting

18:20.960 --> 18:22.030
To knock holes in them.

18:22.030 --> 18:24.294
A forensic expert
found her bruising

18:24.300 --> 18:25.768
To be consistent
with a struggle.

18:25.770 --> 18:28.068
He ruled out the possibility
of self-infliction.

18:28.070 --> 18:30.562
Much as I would love to
believe I'm not responsible

18:30.570 --> 18:32.868
For her suicide attempt,
when she's off her meds,

18:32.870 --> 18:34.429
Claudia gets agitated.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.273
The bruises could be
from an unrelated event.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.442
Maybe, but we now
know for a fact

18:39.450 --> 18:41.373
She wasn't
here last night.

18:41.380 --> 18:43.712
Neighbors place her
at home at the time.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.347
She had a verbal
altercation.

18:45.350 --> 18:48.980
That would mean someone
staged her suicide,

18:48.990 --> 18:51.914
You do know she's
a paranoid schizophrenic.

18:51.930 --> 18:55.082
Which makes her
the perfect pawn.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.991
Someone's trying to
get to you, doctor.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.465
Isn't losing a patient
to suicide one

19:01.470 --> 19:05.509
Of the worst things that
can happen to a psychiatrist?

19:05.510 --> 19:09.777
I believe you have
another stalker.

19:09.780 --> 19:11.874
Given your profession,
let's start

19:11.880 --> 19:13.075
With your client list.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.174
Maybe someone who knows
about claudia's

19:15.180 --> 19:16.318
Obsession with you.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.970
Had she ever done
group therapy?

19:17.990 --> 19:20.948
No. My patients
never interact.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.815
Do you have any
disgruntled patients,

19:22.820 --> 19:24.515
Maybe someone whom
you'd never suspect?

19:24.530 --> 19:27.625
I'd suspect them.
I'm good at my job.

19:27.630 --> 19:29.826
Look, detective. I
have frustrated patients.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.525
I have all kinds
of patients,

19:31.530 --> 19:34.693
But a person who would kill an
innocent woman just to hurt me?

19:34.700 --> 19:36.930
No. You're looking
for someone

19:36.940 --> 19:39.034
With narcissistic
personality disorders

19:39.040 --> 19:41.134
With sociopathic
tendencies,

19:41.140 --> 19:42.210
Someone who feels
aggrieved.

19:42.210 --> 19:43.769
Janice: Aggrieved,
someone who feels

19:43.780 --> 19:45.236
Wronged, cheated.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.743
Our stalker believes that
dr. Lewis ruined their life,

19:48.750 --> 19:50.479
And now they want to
do the same thing to him

19:50.490 --> 19:51.548
Through his patients.

19:51.550 --> 19:52.688
I did a search
on the internet.

19:52.690 --> 19:55.489
I found this review site
called shrinkrank.Net.

19:55.490 --> 19:58.380
I know it. It's like
yelp for therapists.

19:58.390 --> 20:00.449
How'd you know that?

20:00.460 --> 20:01.689
Never mind. Look.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.419
Almost all of dr. Lewis'
reviews are positive,

20:04.430 --> 20:06.626
But I've got nasty posts
going back a year

20:06.630 --> 20:08.689
From the screen name
shellacked.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.498
"He screwed me up,
he ruined my life.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.466
He needs to pay."

20:11.470 --> 20:12.699
Look at this one.
"he's so bad

20:12.710 --> 20:15.133
He will lose his patients
to suicide."

20:15.140 --> 20:16.301
Like claudia?

20:16.310 --> 20:17.436
Almost prophetic.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.599
Track down
an ip address.

20:18.610 --> 20:20.942
Let's get
a real name.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.543
Your biggest online
critic is a woman

20:22.550 --> 20:25.440
Named shelly walker.

20:25.450 --> 20:27.942
Can you confirm
she was a patient?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.587
Unless I know someone
to be a threat,

20:29.590 --> 20:31.217
I can't disclose
my patient list.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.982
And there are some things
we don't need you to tell us.

20:32.990 --> 20:35.789
For instance, we already
know her life is a mess.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.928
Her license was revoked
16 months ago

20:37.930 --> 20:40.524
Doctor, we both know that
people with mental illness

20:40.540 --> 20:42.634
Often try to
self-medicate with alcohol.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.789
Is that the case here?

20:43.810 --> 20:46.006
She wrote all this
about me?

20:46.010 --> 20:47.205
I had no idea.

20:47.210 --> 20:49.235
These threats are
explicit enough

20:49.240 --> 20:50.435
To break confidentiality.

20:50.450 --> 20:57.709
Ok. Um, I saw her over a
year ago for a few months

20:57.720 --> 20:58.869
About her
drinking problem.

20:58.890 --> 21:01.040
Is there any way she could
have known about claudia?

21:01.060 --> 21:02.084
I don't know how.

21:02.090 --> 21:03.956
Could she have broken
into your patient files?

21:03.960 --> 21:06.679
Did claudia and shelly
see you on the same day

21:06.690 --> 21:07.782
Of the week by chance?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.222
Shelly had stopped
going to therapy

21:09.230 --> 21:10.959
Before claudia
even started.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.429
Was there any hint of shelly's
resentment toward you?

21:14.440 --> 21:17.296
No. We worked
on her codependency issue.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.732
She didn't think
her marriage worked

21:18.740 --> 21:20.663
Unless she and her husband
were drinking together.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.068
She didn't want it
to fail,

21:22.080 --> 21:23.832
But she also desperately
wanted to stop drinking.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.239
I take it the sessions
didn't go well.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.844
Apparently not,
but I thought we got

21:28.850 --> 21:31.444
To the root
of her problem.

21:31.450 --> 21:33.384
The last time
I saw her,

21:33.390 --> 21:36.212
She was going
into rehab.

21:48.840 --> 21:49.932
I got this.

21:49.940 --> 21:51.032
What do you mean?

21:51.040 --> 21:52.098
I'll do the talking.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.737
This power struggle
thing is very one-sided.

21:53.740 --> 21:55.560
That's because you
outrank me.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.230
Well, janice outranks
me. I don't have

21:57.250 --> 21:58.979
A problem being
under her.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.402
So she was on top.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.514
Oh, that's just rude.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.340
Is this thing with us
about janice?

22:04.350 --> 22:05.317
It happened once.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.583
Is janice why you
don't like me?

22:06.590 --> 22:08.809
Because that's
just petty.

22:08.820 --> 22:10.049
I'm detective caldwell,

22:10.060 --> 22:11.516
This is
detective larsen.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.726
Is shelly walker home?

22:15.030 --> 22:16.429
I have no idea
where she is.

22:16.430 --> 22:18.159
We separated
over a year ago.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.422
While she was
in rehab?

22:19.430 --> 22:22.297
Shelly never went
to rehab. I did.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.098
When I came back sober,
she couldn't stand it,

22:24.110 --> 22:26.568
Said if I loved her
I'd drink with her.

22:26.570 --> 22:27.901
Then I tried to get
her sober,

22:27.910 --> 22:28.968
And she hated me
for it.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.334
Did shelly ever talk
to you about

22:30.350 --> 22:32.375
Her therapist
dr. Lewis?

22:32.380 --> 22:33.848
No, not really.

22:33.850 --> 22:34.749
Ben: Are you sure?

22:34.750 --> 22:36.616
We have reason to
believe she blamed him

22:36.620 --> 22:37.644
For her problems.

22:37.650 --> 22:39.584
She wasn't in good shape,
all right?

22:39.590 --> 22:42.082
She blamed everyone.

22:42.090 --> 22:44.252
I wish her well,
you know,

22:44.260 --> 22:48.959
But, yeah, she hated
that guy.

22:57.740 --> 23:01.404
So this woman
who's stalking you,

23:01.410 --> 23:06.200
She isn't going to go
glenn close on me, is she?

23:06.210 --> 23:07.177
What?

23:07.180 --> 23:09.547
Glenn close,
"fatal"--never mind.

23:09.550 --> 23:12.588
Vanessa, you know I
can't talk about my work.

23:12.590 --> 23:14.046
I was making a joke,

23:14.060 --> 23:16.279
And being stalked
doesn't count as work.

23:16.290 --> 23:19.123
[thump]

23:19.130 --> 23:20.620
What was that?

23:20.630 --> 23:23.156
Uh, someone
downstairs.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.322
Stay here.

23:25.330 --> 23:27.128
Is it her?

23:27.140 --> 23:28.960
Call 911.

23:29.970 --> 23:31.597
You forgot to put it
back on the cradle.

23:31.610 --> 23:35.535
What are we gonna do?
My cell's downstairs.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.269
When did you get
a gun?

23:37.280 --> 23:41.103
It's legal. It's to
defend myself and you.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.270
Stay here.

23:53.090 --> 23:55.252
[thud]

24:31.230 --> 24:33.619
[door opens and closes]

24:33.630 --> 24:35.860
[footsteps]

24:44.480 --> 24:48.110
[door squeaking]

24:54.190 --> 24:56.454
Aah!

25:00.260 --> 25:03.355
You could have
killed me.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.192
I...

25:14.410 --> 25:17.971
Shelly initiated her stalking by
going after dr. Lewis' patients.

25:17.980 --> 25:19.300
But she failed
with claudia's suicide,

25:19.310 --> 25:21.642
And this isn't a person
who takes failing gracefully.

25:21.650 --> 25:22.742
It triggered
an escalation.

25:22.750 --> 25:26.448
Now she's going after
dr. Lewis directly.

25:27.850 --> 25:29.579
Did you find out
how she got in?

25:29.590 --> 25:30.955
There's no sign
of forced entry.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.588
Are you sure you set the
alarm before you went to bed?

25:33.590 --> 25:34.625
Yes.

25:34.630 --> 25:36.951
[slurred]
you don't always remember.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.155
I set it.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.628
Mrs. Lewis,
are you ok?

25:40.640 --> 25:43.564
I gave her a sedative.
She was upset.

25:43.570 --> 25:45.698
Well, you did
nearly shoot me.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.906
I suggest you
check in to a hotel

25:47.910 --> 25:50.538
Until we can locate
shelly.

25:50.550 --> 25:53.269
Fine. I'll go pack.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.669
Adam: I'll come
with you.

25:59.350 --> 26:02.479
She invades his home
but doesn't make contact.

26:02.490 --> 26:04.709
Nothing's missing.
Why did she come here?

26:04.730 --> 26:07.256
To terrorize, put
pressure on the marriage.

26:07.260 --> 26:09.957
The attempt on claudia's life
was made to look like a suicide.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.691
She wanted to make him feel
like he had failed his patient.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.429
She's attacking every
aspect of his life--

26:14.440 --> 26:18.195
First professional
and now personal.

26:21.110 --> 26:22.259
Beth:
I touched everything,

26:22.280 --> 26:25.136
So you'll need
my elimination prints,

26:25.150 --> 26:28.472
And this is
postmarked seattle.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.814
I'll let you know as soon
as I have something.

26:31.820 --> 26:33.811
[knock on door]

26:33.820 --> 26:36.050
This a bad time?

26:37.060 --> 26:39.256
What case was that?
It's nothing.

26:39.260 --> 26:40.659
What do you need?

26:40.660 --> 26:45.757
Just checking in.
How are you?

26:45.770 --> 26:47.465
You ok?

26:47.470 --> 26:49.666
I'm fine. Why?

26:49.670 --> 26:53.163
Nothing. I mean,
usually, you micromanage

26:53.170 --> 26:55.502
Every aspect
of every case,

26:55.510 --> 26:57.729
And today, you're not
is all.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.070
It's called
delegating, jack.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.549
Have you, uh, located
shelly walker yet?

27:01.550 --> 27:03.712
So you're up to
speed? Good.

27:03.720 --> 27:07.020
I ran shelly walker through
every database we have access to.

27:07.020 --> 27:08.840
She just popped up on
the automated f.I. System.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.919
You found a field
interview card on her?

27:10.930 --> 27:11.988
What was she
witness to?

27:11.990 --> 27:13.151
A dispute at her
current address.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.254
It's the place we
would have looked for her.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.625
And where is that?

27:16.630 --> 27:19.520
A sober living house.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.879
I've been sober
for a year.

27:36.520 --> 27:37.544
See?

27:37.550 --> 27:39.109
I don't think
a one-year chip's

27:39.120 --> 27:40.440
Gonna hold up in court.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.851
Where were you
last night, shelly?

27:42.860 --> 27:45.716
At a late aa meeting.
You can call my sponsor.

27:45.730 --> 27:48.688
Your husband claims
you never went to rehab.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.327
I'm not surprised.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.867
Jason will say
pretty much anything

27:52.870 --> 27:54.122
To further his agenda.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.234
Which is?
He's a control freak.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.390
When I told him
I wanted to stop drinking,

27:58.410 --> 28:00.560
He did everything he could
to sabotage me.

28:00.570 --> 28:03.039
That's funny. He said
the same thing about you.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.634
You can ask anyone
at new springs recovery.

28:05.650 --> 28:07.470
When jason came to visit,
he brought a soda cup

28:07.480 --> 28:09.847
Filled with vodka
and tried to trick me

28:09.850 --> 28:11.443
Into drinking it.

28:11.450 --> 28:12.747
What'd you do?

28:12.750 --> 28:14.388
I had to cut ties.

28:14.390 --> 28:16.313
He wasn't interested
in getting sober,

28:16.320 --> 28:19.779
And he hated that
I'd stopped drinking.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.059
I'm getting a telephonic
search warrant

28:24.070 --> 28:25.993
And having units meet
us at the walkers' house.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.593
If what shelly says
is true, jason lied.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.898
She's the one who went to
rehab. He never got sober.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.561
Shelly was
his drinking buddy.

28:31.570 --> 28:33.504
When she got into
rehab, it just have felt like

28:33.510 --> 28:34.432
A complete betrayal.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.760
In his drunken mind,
he became convinced

28:35.780 --> 28:38.078
That dr. Lewis was the
cause of all his problems.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.332
Dr. Lewis ruined
his life.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.773
Now jason wants
to ruin his.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.412
Janice: No sign of him?

28:47.420 --> 28:48.683
We put out a bolo
on his car.

28:48.690 --> 28:50.818
Looks like he went out
for a pack of cigarettes.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.616
No. He's gone.
We must have tipped him off.

28:52.630 --> 28:54.280
He must have left
in a hurry.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.860
And he left
his laptop.

29:00.270 --> 29:03.069
He knew we'd find
shelly eventually,

29:03.070 --> 29:05.789
Get the real story.

29:05.810 --> 29:09.838
Appears to be
a high-functioning alcoholic.

29:18.990 --> 29:21.015
Photos of dr. Lewis

29:21.020 --> 29:23.114
At his home, office

29:23.120 --> 29:24.884
Time-stamped
8 months ago.

29:24.890 --> 29:28.349
Ben: Hey, guys.
Check it out.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.852
Jason had access
to shelly's account.

29:30.870 --> 29:34.090
He was the one writing
those reviews.

29:36.570 --> 29:37.935
This just took a turn.

29:37.940 --> 29:39.192
He took them without
her knowledge.

29:39.210 --> 29:40.803
To get off on?
No. This is revenge.

29:40.810 --> 29:42.039
He had something
to prove.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.474
Dr. Lewis took
his wife,

29:43.480 --> 29:45.471
So jason targets
vanessa.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.606
Where is she?

29:46.610 --> 29:47.771
The bonaventure hotel.

29:47.780 --> 29:50.442
Finish up here.
Jack.

29:58.220 --> 30:01.588
[music playing]

30:08.130 --> 30:11.498
[shower running]

30:17.080 --> 30:20.641
Honey, is that you?

30:33.060 --> 30:34.949
[gasps]

30:36.730 --> 30:37.526
Bill.

30:37.530 --> 30:39.123
How much time
do we have?

30:39.130 --> 30:42.259
Adam's at work
as usual.

30:55.180 --> 30:57.046
[knock on door]

30:57.050 --> 30:59.212
Vanessa?

31:01.790 --> 31:03.189
[knocking]

31:03.190 --> 31:06.057
It's detective lawrence.

31:09.930 --> 31:10.852
Are you ok?

31:10.870 --> 31:14.022
I'm fine.
What's going on?

31:14.030 --> 31:17.068
Can we come in?
We need to talk.

31:17.070 --> 31:18.538
I just got out
of the shower.

31:18.540 --> 31:20.907
We've identified
your husband's stalker.

31:20.910 --> 31:23.675
You already told me.
Shelly walker.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.933
We were wrong.
It's her husband.

31:25.950 --> 31:29.204
We think he may be
targeting you.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.972
Oh.

31:32.350 --> 31:35.183
Ok. Come in.

31:35.190 --> 31:36.282
We tried to reach you,

31:36.290 --> 31:38.918
But you didn't
answer your phone.

31:40.630 --> 31:43.258
I must have been
in the shower.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.932
Janice: The man who's been
stalking you and your husband

31:54.940 --> 31:56.305
Is jason walker.

31:56.310 --> 31:59.075
The name doesn't
ring a bell. Should it?

31:59.080 --> 32:01.572
Jack: Maybe this
will help.

32:08.450 --> 32:10.714
You recognize him.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.984
It's bill.

32:14.330 --> 32:16.651
See you next week.

32:17.530 --> 32:20.329
Good-bye.
Thank you, doctor.

32:39.820 --> 32:43.358
We met as volunteers at a
homeless shelter downtown.

32:43.360 --> 32:47.388
Bill--I mean, jason was
the best-looking guy there.

32:47.390 --> 32:49.085
He was charming, funny.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.727
All the women flirted
with him,

32:50.730 --> 32:52.721
So it was nice when he
asked for my number.

32:52.730 --> 32:54.095
You were flattered.
Things have tough

32:54.100 --> 32:55.568
Between you and
dr. Lewis for a while?

32:55.570 --> 32:57.937
Our marriage had
gone stale a long time ago,

32:57.940 --> 33:00.102
But I wasn't looking
for it.

33:00.110 --> 33:01.999
I'd never cheated
on adam,

33:02.010 --> 33:04.377
But bill pursued me.

33:04.380 --> 33:05.506
Judging by the bed,

33:05.510 --> 33:07.979
He was here,
wasn't he?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.515
I'm so stupid.

33:13.520 --> 33:17.309
Did the two of you ever
have sex at your house?

33:17.320 --> 33:18.287
Yes.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.759
So he had access
to your keys?

33:20.760 --> 33:22.285
He saw you input
your alarm code?

33:22.300 --> 33:25.349
Oh, god. It's my fault.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.691
Did you ever discuss
your husband and his work?

33:27.700 --> 33:29.259
Did you talk
about his patients.

33:29.270 --> 33:31.489
Well, we'd talk.

33:31.510 --> 33:35.367
He was interested
in why I was so unhappy.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.235
I told him about the one
patient I knew about.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.971
I told him about that woman
that showed up in phoenix.

33:39.980 --> 33:44.042
That's how he knew
to target claudia.

33:44.050 --> 33:46.246
He used me.

33:46.250 --> 33:47.615
I believe he's
a revenge stalker

33:47.620 --> 33:49.611
With a total lack of empathy
for anyone hurt

33:49.620 --> 33:50.712
In the pursuit
of his goal.

33:50.720 --> 33:54.156
The only person he really
wanted to hurt, vanessa,

33:54.160 --> 33:58.154
Was your husband,
not you.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.905
Open.

34:16.219 --> 34:18.574
Open!

34:18.590 --> 34:19.842
[grunting]

34:19.850 --> 34:21.011

34:21.020 --> 34:22.681
[gagging]

34:29.929 --> 34:32.956
Swallow. Swallow.

34:32.969 --> 34:35.029
Swallow!

34:35.040 --> 34:36.188
Swallow.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.168
[gagging]

34:40.909 --> 34:41.763
[coughs]

34:41.780 --> 34:43.578
What did you
just give me?

34:43.580 --> 34:48.370
I stole from your wife while
I was having sex with her.

34:50.250 --> 34:52.344
Turn around.
Get on your knees.

34:52.350 --> 34:53.909
Get on your knees!

34:53.920 --> 34:57.117
Now let's get this
over your head, shall we?

34:57.120 --> 34:58.918
Wait. You don't
have to do this.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.079
Oh, I'm not doing anything.

35:00.090 --> 35:01.558
You're gonna
do it, doctor.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.790
You know the suicide rate
for psychiatrists

35:03.800 --> 35:05.290
Is extremely high?

35:05.300 --> 35:06.620
When you fall asleep,

35:06.630 --> 35:13.263
And then the wait is going to
tighten the noose around your neck.

35:13.270 --> 35:14.863
Janice: Any sign
of dr. Lewis?

35:14.880 --> 35:16.507
Ben: Not yet.
I've been calling.

35:16.510 --> 35:17.671
Where's the wife?

35:17.680 --> 35:19.375
In her room
with hotel security.

35:19.380 --> 35:21.542
Send a uni
to dr. Lewis' office.

35:21.550 --> 35:24.440
We're close.
We're headed there now.

35:28.250 --> 35:31.811
Police know
who you are.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.288
They'll know that
you did this.

35:34.290 --> 35:35.360
No, no, no, no.

35:35.360 --> 35:36.896
See, you're not well.

35:36.900 --> 35:39.926
You've been stressed.
You have a stalker.

35:39.930 --> 35:43.764
And then you rejected her,
and she tried to kill herself,

35:43.770 --> 35:47.809
And now you find out
your wife is having an affair.

35:47.810 --> 35:50.575
Go ahead. Ask her.
She'll tell you.

35:50.580 --> 35:53.208
She's really good
in bed, too.

35:53.210 --> 35:55.747
Passionate and hungry,
all those things

35:55.750 --> 36:01.086
Everyone will know that you killed
yourself because you're a failure

36:01.090 --> 36:04.754
As a husband
and as a psychiatrist.

36:14.230 --> 36:16.597
Ben: Dr. Lewis' car is
still in the parking lot

36:16.600 --> 36:18.489
Along with a late model
sedan registered

36:18.510 --> 36:22.208
I got the building manager
to give me the keys.

36:29.980 --> 36:34.247
Your case, your call.
How you want to play it?

36:39.990 --> 36:42.288
[patient light clicks]

36:52.070 --> 36:55.233
Hi. I'm here to see
dr. Lewis.

36:55.240 --> 36:56.901
I have
an appointment.

36:56.910 --> 36:57.980
He's not here.

36:57.980 --> 37:01.371
Oh. Will he be
back soon?

37:01.380 --> 37:03.371
I can wait.

37:07.720 --> 37:10.781
No. He's not
coming back.

37:13.660 --> 37:15.185
You need to leave.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.328
Don't move.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.489
Man: Go.

37:22.770 --> 37:25.330
Call an r.A. Unit.

37:28.740 --> 37:31.471
He's breathing.
I need an r.A. Unit now.

37:31.480 --> 37:34.450
Ok. Dispatch, 2819.

37:34.450 --> 37:36.339
Code 4.

[police radio chatter]

37:42.290 --> 37:45.715
[music playing]

38:21.590 --> 38:24.321
Dr. Lewis is awake.
He's gonna be fine.

38:24.330 --> 38:25.695
He's with his wife.

38:25.700 --> 38:26.826
Is that good thing?

38:26.830 --> 38:29.322
Relationships are
complicated.

38:29.340 --> 38:32.230
Drinks on me.
What do you say?

38:32.240 --> 38:34.834
Sure. Yeah. As
long as you're buying.

38:34.840 --> 38:38.674
You guys have fun.
See you tomorrow.

38:46.220 --> 38:48.439
Jack: Are you ok?

38:49.490 --> 38:55.259
Yeah. I just have some
work to catch up on.

38:57.830 --> 38:59.559
What is it?

38:59.570 --> 39:00.594
Nothing.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.568
You're hovering.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.034
I just had a really
hard day, jack, that's all.

39:06.040 --> 39:12.104
I'm not a psychiatrist, but if
you need someone to talk to...

39:13.180 --> 39:16.912
Thank you.
I'll keep that in mind,

39:16.920 --> 39:17.944
But not tonight.

39:17.950 --> 39:19.440
I have something
I need to do.

39:19.450 --> 39:22.647
Rain check then?

39:22.660 --> 39:27.450
You actually agreed to
a future drink with me?

39:27.460 --> 39:29.622
I'm gonna
hold you to it.

39:29.630 --> 39:32.520
I'm sure you will.

39:32.530 --> 39:34.669
Good night, jack.

39:38.700 --> 39:42.102
[music continues]
