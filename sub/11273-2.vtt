WEBVTT

00:03.501 --> 00:06.918
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:08.169 --> 00:11.408
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong, Mr Peterson?

00:11.586 --> 00:14.367
It's my anniversary, I have nothing
for Vera, and stores are closed.

00:15.663 --> 00:17.483
Normie's in big trouble now.

00:17.662 --> 00:19.817
Will Mrs Peterson
give you the cold shoulder?

00:19.996 --> 00:23.815
It's not the cold shoulder I mind.
It's the hard knee.

00:24.776 --> 00:26.406
Well, not to worry there, Norm.

00:26.574 --> 00:28.271
I think with your wit
and resourcefulness,

00:28.439 --> 00:30.806
you'll come up with a suitable gift.

00:31.488 --> 00:33.185
Yeah.

00:33.353 --> 00:35.754
You're absolutely right, Cliffie.

00:37.898 --> 00:40.042
I tried. I'm doomed.

00:41.014 --> 00:42.678
I know where there's
a gas station open.

00:42.845 --> 00:45.414
Why don't you get her
a can of 40-weight.

00:45.593 --> 00:47.380
- Very funny.
- Hey, why not give her

00:47.547 --> 00:50.037
the best gift of all, Mr Peterson?

00:50.216 --> 00:51.958
A night of romance.

00:52.126 --> 00:54.538
Carla, where's that gas station at?

00:55.376 --> 00:57.866
Come on. Come on, Norm.
You can do better than that.

00:58.045 --> 01:00.033
- What?
- That ashtray's better than that.

01:00.211 --> 01:02.278
Come on, man.

01:02.668 --> 01:04.566
Ashtray, huh?

01:06.410 --> 01:08.442
It's a little shoddy, but...

01:08.621 --> 01:11.402
You know, with a nice pack
of cigarettes or something,

01:11.994 --> 01:15.400
a nice snappy new pack of matches,
I think we got something here.

01:15.567 --> 01:17.555
- Hey, hey, hey, Norm!
- Does Vera even smoke?

01:17.734 --> 01:20.135
Oh, yeah, she's been
known to smoke.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.190
Occasionally after sex.

01:22.357 --> 01:24.390
Usually during.

02:43.827 --> 02:47.569
Well, not the best I've had,
but it'll serve. Refill, Sam.

02:47.747 --> 02:50.227
Frasier, I'm not sure how
to get into this,

02:50.405 --> 02:53.019
but your bar bill's up to 500 dollars.

02:53.733 --> 02:56.570
My God. Really?

02:57.240 --> 02:59.518
I'm shocked.

03:00.110 --> 03:04.846
Well, I promised myself that
if I reached 500 dollars, I'd quit.

03:05.024 --> 03:06.431
So that does it.

03:06.599 --> 03:09.380
I'll raise my limit to 1,000.

03:10.351 --> 03:12.250
I hope you understand
it's just business,

03:12.429 --> 03:14.796
but 500's a little out
of my comfort zone there.

03:14.975 --> 03:16.963
Oh, I understand, Sam.

03:17.130 --> 03:20.045
Seems nobody wants to pay a man
for sitting around and drinking all day.

03:20.213 --> 03:23.407
Yeah, it's a world gone mad,
huh, Fras?

03:24.423 --> 03:27.204
Sam, I've come to
a very important decision.

03:27.371 --> 03:29.359
I've just taken stock of myself.

03:29.538 --> 03:32.821
It's not exactly AT&T, is it?

03:33.659 --> 03:36.663
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
of my shattered life.

03:36.830 --> 03:39.611
But in order to do that,
you gotta hit rock bottom first.

03:39.779 --> 03:41.566
For you, that's three flights up.

03:41.733 --> 03:46.189
Carla, you wanna see if anyone
in the back has open wounds to salt?

03:46.904 --> 03:48.858
Spoilsport.

03:49.026 --> 03:51.393
- Sam, you are my inspiration.
- Well, thank you.

03:51.561 --> 03:54.051
You, too, were a worthless,
drooling drunk.

03:54.230 --> 03:56.676
Carla, hold it a second.

03:56.855 --> 03:58.262
Sam, I'm sorry.

03:58.429 --> 04:00.674
See, the point is that
you pulled yourself together.

04:00.853 --> 04:05.800
I have to rebuild my life, my career,
my reputation, my self-esteem.

04:05.968 --> 04:09.217
I'm no longer worthy
to practice psychiatry,

04:09.385 --> 04:11.786
but I'm gonna make myself worthy.

04:11.965 --> 04:14.712
I'll start at the lowest,
most menial level.

04:14.880 --> 04:18.654
- Sam, who sweeps the floors here?
- Me and Woody.

04:18.833 --> 04:20.866
Mostly Woody. All right, Woody.

04:21.033 --> 04:23.780
Well, let me do it for both of you.

04:23.948 --> 04:27.644
- You can pay me whatever you'd like.
- Oh, gee, Frasier. I don't know.

04:27.823 --> 04:30.660
No, Sam, I know you think it's beneath
me, but I really need this now.

04:30.827 --> 04:33.195
No, no, I just don't know
where Woody put the broom.

04:33.362 --> 04:35.440
Maybe if you try
in the back closet there.

04:35.607 --> 04:38.723
I mean, it's okay with me, but you sure
you want Diane to see this?

04:38.902 --> 04:43.023
Yes. Let her confront her guilt
for what she's wrought

04:43.190 --> 04:45.848
by her refusal to work out
our relationship.

04:46.016 --> 04:49.422
And if I have a scintilla
of psychological acumen left,

04:49.601 --> 04:53.967
when she sees my humiliation,
she'll eat her liver.

04:59.462 --> 05:01.081
What's Frasier doing?

05:01.260 --> 05:04.420
Well, he's the new janitor.

05:10.083 --> 05:11.948
Poor Frasier.

05:12.126 --> 05:15.566
I had no idea he'd take it so hard.

05:15.745 --> 05:20.234
This is my saddest romantic legacy.

05:20.402 --> 05:24.098
But I refuse to hold myself responsible.
Do I beg men to fall in love with me?

05:24.277 --> 05:26.645
I certainly hope not.
I'd like to think I was special.

05:28.487 --> 05:30.799
Have you made any friends
since you moved to Boston?

05:31.436 --> 05:35.099
A few, if you count cats.

05:35.847 --> 05:37.723
You're really cute.

05:37.891 --> 05:39.599
I'd love to have a friend like you.

05:42.257 --> 05:45.675
Look, Sam. Could we be in on
the inception of a budding romance?

05:45.842 --> 05:47.585
You talking about a foursome here?

05:51.918 --> 05:55.078
How can you make a sweet,
innocent flirtation

05:55.257 --> 05:58.775
into something tawdry?

05:58.953 --> 06:02.315
I could tell you, but it'd be
a lot more fun to show you.

06:03.365 --> 06:08.524
So, Woody, maybe we could go out
for coffee after you get off work.

06:08.703 --> 06:12.310
Oh, gee, Lisa,
I'd like to, but I gotta...

06:12.489 --> 06:15.058
- I gotta do something else.
- What?

06:15.236 --> 06:18.352
I don't know, but I gotta start right now.
Excuse me.

06:21.233 --> 06:24.975
My God. I don't think I've ever
seen a man Woody's age

06:25.142 --> 06:27.018
so painfully shy around women.

06:27.186 --> 06:29.420
That young lady asked him out.
He refused her.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.921
- Two beers, Sam.
- Well, maybe...

06:32.100 --> 06:34.791
Maybe she came on too strong.
Some guys don't like that.

06:34.970 --> 06:36.835
Well, I know how the lad feels.

06:37.003 --> 06:40.532
I mean, in the mating ritual,
I like to be the aggressor.

06:42.050 --> 06:46.160
Of course, I don't mind a woman giving
me a clear signal that I caught her eye.

06:46.328 --> 06:49.332
You mean like sticking
a finger down her throat?

06:52.124 --> 06:55.229
Woody hasn't had a date
since he came to work here.

06:55.407 --> 06:59.182
Well, look, later on tonight,
I'm gonna go cruising for chicks,

06:59.361 --> 07:02.812
a popular pastime
among virile studs of today.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.610
I'll take Woody along.

07:04.777 --> 07:07.692
There's not a man yet that's
come back from a Clavin love safari

07:07.860 --> 07:11.188
without some trophy
to hang on his game-room wall.

07:11.355 --> 07:13.846
Especially the horns, you know.

07:15.554 --> 07:19.005
Hey, Woody. Lookit, later on, I'm
going out scouting for chickereenios.

07:19.184 --> 07:21.462
- You wanna come?
- Well, sure.

07:21.641 --> 07:24.120
What is that, some kind of cereal?

07:25.628 --> 07:27.705
I'm not sure,
but I think he means girls.

07:27.884 --> 07:30.709
Yeah, that's right. Come on, Wood.
Look, I got this great pickup line.

07:30.877 --> 07:32.865
We pull up next to this
cute-looking babe, right?

07:33.043 --> 07:34.752
I say, "Hey, my friend likes you."

07:34.919 --> 07:38.359
Yeah, and if that doesn't work,
Cliff throws an egg at her. It's great.

07:39.040 --> 07:42.692
That sounds like swell times, but I'm
not much in the mood for it. Thanks.

07:42.871 --> 07:46.724
Woody, would you mind if I stuck
my big fat nose in your affairs?

07:47.495 --> 07:50.823
Stick your big fat nose
wherever you like, Miss Chambers.

07:53.860 --> 07:55.435
There's no need
to hide your feelings.

07:55.614 --> 07:58.685
You're afraid of ladies
rejecting you, aren't you?

07:59.891 --> 08:03.554
No, it's not so much that.
It's just that...

08:03.722 --> 08:05.430
Well, I got this problem.

08:05.843 --> 08:09.339
What problem? We at Cheers
always share our problems.

08:09.518 --> 08:13.750
Besides, we kind of ran out of things
to talk about, so we'd appreciate it.

08:15.135 --> 08:19.535
All right. There's this girl
back home named Beth Curtis,

08:19.714 --> 08:22.573
and she is the most
wonderful girl in the world.

08:22.752 --> 08:26.325
We dated ever since we were kids,
but last year we split up.

08:26.504 --> 08:28.782
You know, I wanted to travel
around and see the world.

08:28.950 --> 08:31.195
She wanted to stay in lndiana.

08:31.373 --> 08:34.443
At first I thought it would be okay...

08:34.914 --> 08:37.437
...but now I just can't seem
to get her out of my mind.

08:37.616 --> 08:41.849
Everything I do, everywhere I go,
everything I see reminds me of her.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.102
Beth.

08:57.808 --> 08:59.840
Poor kid, huh?

09:00.723 --> 09:03.202
Oh, wait a second.
Was that your meddling "hmm"?

09:03.381 --> 09:06.965
Oh, Sam, we have to get
those two back together.

09:07.133 --> 09:09.087
There's nothing sadder than a man

09:09.255 --> 09:12.036
who wants his maiden
and is denied her.

09:12.214 --> 09:14.582
It tears my heart out.

09:14.750 --> 09:19.864
Frasier. You're getting dirt
on my new Joan & Davids.

09:23.829 --> 09:26.688
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

09:26.867 --> 09:28.352
What do you say to a beer, Normie?

09:28.698 --> 09:30.977
Hi, sailor. New in town?

09:33.188 --> 09:34.986
Where's Diane?
Back from the airport yet?

09:35.153 --> 09:36.560
No, no, not yet.

09:36.728 --> 09:38.973
What's Diane doing
down at the airport?

09:39.151 --> 09:41.888
Well, we all got together
and thought it'd be kind of fun

09:42.055 --> 09:44.266
to get Woody's girlfriend
out here and surprise him.

09:44.434 --> 09:45.673
She's still picking her up.

09:45.852 --> 09:48.220
What do you mean,
"we all got together"?

09:48.387 --> 09:51.257
I didn't all get together.
Did you, Norm?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.915
Yeah. Yeah, it was
a good meeting, actually.

09:54.094 --> 09:58.293
Had some hors d'oeuvres. It kind of
turned into a little party, you know.

09:58.461 --> 10:00.493
Well, you might have invited me.

10:00.672 --> 10:04.078
Oh, we might have,
but we wanted to enjoy ourselves.

10:09.081 --> 10:11.739
- Hey, Fras, how's the job going, bud?
- Oh, great.

10:11.907 --> 10:15.525
Yeah, I hear you're really
cleaning up in your new business.

10:15.950 --> 10:20.071
At least I was invited to the party.
Great rumaki, Sam.

10:23.354 --> 10:26.727
Everyone, this is Beth Curtis.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.972
- Hi, Beth.
- Hi, everybody.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.602
How you doing? Sam Malone.

10:30.770 --> 10:32.679
I guess-- I guess
Woody told you all about me.

10:32.847 --> 10:35.136
I haven't spoken to Woody in ages.

10:35.304 --> 10:37.928
That's all right. What could he
tell you that you can't see?

10:38.308 --> 10:39.682
Sam, please.

10:41.424 --> 10:44.953
I'd really like to thank whoever all's
responsible for bringing me out here.

10:45.132 --> 10:47.957
- Yeah. Cliff Clavin, do-gooder.
- Hi.

10:49.465 --> 10:51.497
Gosh, I can't believe
how big this city is.

10:51.665 --> 10:53.038
Yeah, yeah, quite a place.

10:53.206 --> 10:58.444
You know, Boston is the hub of Boston
proper, which comprises some--

10:58.622 --> 11:02.062
There's probably, what,
two and three-quarter million people

11:02.241 --> 11:04.028
spread out in 83 cities and towns.

11:04.363 --> 11:05.982
Get out of here.

11:06.161 --> 11:07.735
You question my figures?

11:07.903 --> 11:11.644
No, I want you to get out of here.

11:17.608 --> 11:19.596
So where's my butterball?

11:20.768 --> 11:22.343
- You mean Woody?
- Yeah.

11:22.522 --> 11:24.007
He doesn't mind me
calling him that.

11:24.186 --> 11:25.839
He's not very sensitive
about his weight.

11:26.017 --> 11:28.217
Woody's not fat, Beth.

11:28.385 --> 11:30.786
He was the last time I saw him.

11:30.965 --> 11:34.416
- Wow. He lost weight too?
- Too?

11:34.594 --> 11:38.280
Yeah. I don't like to brag or anything,
but I just lost 50 pounds.

11:38.458 --> 11:40.826
I don't think Woody
will even recognise me.

11:41.585 --> 11:44.031
Beth, that's wonderful.

11:44.210 --> 11:46.778
Norman, isn't that wonderful?

11:50.698 --> 11:52.686
Yeah, it's great. Great.

11:52.865 --> 11:56.271
You know, actually, I just lost
a little weight recently myself.

11:56.450 --> 11:58.851
No, I just found it.

12:08.232 --> 12:10.845
Beth? You shrunk.

12:11.013 --> 12:13.224
I shrunk? Look at you.

12:16.764 --> 12:18.964
Wow, my hands can touch.

12:20.963 --> 12:24.325
This is a dream come true.
What are you doing here?

12:24.504 --> 12:27.452
- Well, your friends brought me out.
- They did?

12:27.631 --> 12:31.037
Thanks, guys.
You've been so good to me.

12:31.204 --> 12:33.572
In fact, next to
the Twilley brothers back home,

12:33.751 --> 12:35.325
you're the closest friends I have.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.570
Woody, after you left,

12:37.749 --> 12:41.401
both Twilley brothers
made improper advances to me.

12:42.696 --> 12:45.980
Hey, that makes you
my closest friends.

12:46.694 --> 12:48.682
Woody, why don't you
take the rest of the day off.

12:48.861 --> 12:50.357
Oh, really? Thanks, Sam.

12:50.525 --> 12:53.228
- Look at you. I can't believe it.
- I can't believe it either.

12:53.395 --> 12:57.974
You know, in high school, we were
voted the couple most likely to explode.

12:58.566 --> 13:00.933
Hey, I'll show you the sights.
What do you wanna see first?

13:01.101 --> 13:02.676
I'd kind of like to get a bite.

13:02.854 --> 13:04.306
Didn't you eat on the plane?

13:04.474 --> 13:07.042
Yeah, but not enough, I guess,
because I'm kind of hungry again.

13:07.221 --> 13:10.248
Yeah, I'm famished. See you later.

13:12.302 --> 13:13.955
Do you find that strange?

13:14.134 --> 13:15.787
The first thing they wanted
to do was eat?

13:15.966 --> 13:17.920
Yeah, yeah, Woody just got back
from lunch too.

13:18.087 --> 13:21.002
Yeah, I'll say it's strange.
If I hadn't seen my girl in that long,

13:21.170 --> 13:23.202
I know what the first thing
on her mind would be.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.994
"How did he find me in Tibet?"

13:35.576 --> 13:38.324
Sam, I finally did it.
It took three days,

13:38.491 --> 13:41.976
but I removed every trace of
Carla's number from the men's room.

13:43.684 --> 13:46.141
Would you mind
your own business?

13:46.811 --> 13:51.301
Frasier, for God's sake,
hasn't this gone on long enough?

13:51.480 --> 13:54.473
If you're trying to make me
feel guilty, you succeeded.

13:54.640 --> 13:58.247
Don't flatter yourself,
Your Highness.

14:00.012 --> 14:02.491
I'm working here because I enjoy it.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.624
The Crane family
is no stranger to hard work.

14:04.792 --> 14:06.835
When my ancestors
first came to this country,

14:07.003 --> 14:09.460
they had nothing but strong backs,
a dream of freedom

14:09.627 --> 14:12.163
and a small personal fortune.

14:13.916 --> 14:16.239
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a life to live.

14:16.417 --> 14:19.321
Sam, where do you keep
the Jonny Mop?

14:20.572 --> 14:23.107
Sam, stop him.

14:23.286 --> 14:25.899
Don't let him put on
this stupid display.

14:26.067 --> 14:28.981
Well, sweetheart, I'm helping
him regain his self-respect.

14:29.149 --> 14:33.437
Besides, people come here specifically
to see the sweeping psychiatrist.

14:35.816 --> 14:37.603
Sorry I'm late.

14:37.771 --> 14:39.345
Beth and I had to go
to Baskin-Robbins

14:39.513 --> 14:42.048
for the changing of the flavours.

14:43.433 --> 14:45.298
Woody, how are you
and Beth getting along?

14:45.465 --> 14:47.677
Oh, great.

14:47.844 --> 14:50.513
We had this wonderful
breakfast this morning.

14:50.670 --> 14:53.461
Pancakes and sausages
and hash browns.

14:53.629 --> 14:55.505
And then we discovered
this great little treat.

14:55.673 --> 14:57.661
You know how when you
get to the end of a meal

14:57.839 --> 14:59.950
and you find something
to kind of top it off?

15:00.129 --> 15:02.530
- You mean like a sorbet?
- No, like eggs Benedict.

15:02.709 --> 15:04.574
It really hit the spot.

15:04.752 --> 15:07.946
Woody, that's kind of like topping
off a steak dinner with pork chops.

15:08.415 --> 15:11.520
- Great idea.
- Well, it's not original.

15:11.699 --> 15:14.725
It's the Hungry Heifer
Carnivore Platter.

15:18.277 --> 15:21.437
Woody, it's none of my business,
but aren't you and Beth worried

15:21.605 --> 15:23.425
that you might put back on
some of the weight

15:23.604 --> 15:26.217
you worked so hard to take off?

15:26.396 --> 15:30.003
No, we're very careful. We always
stop eating before we get lightheaded.

15:33.342 --> 15:35.252
Oh, who am I kidding?

15:35.431 --> 15:37.497
It's happening all over again.

15:37.675 --> 15:41.171
I swore after I took that 1 00 pounds off
that I'd never tub out again.

15:41.338 --> 15:45.325
Now I'm gonna have to
send home for my fat clothes.

15:45.504 --> 15:48.330
I don't know what comes over us
when we get together.

15:49.502 --> 15:51.077
You know, Woody,
I thought of something.

15:51.244 --> 15:55.287
I have old drinking buddies I can't
be around without wanting a drink.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.784
Automatic thing.

15:56.951 --> 16:01.161
I think that maybe Beth is--
Well, she's like your old eating buddy.

16:01.318 --> 16:04.154
- Very good, Sam.
- Well, thank you.

16:04.322 --> 16:08.476
And just when we were about to hang
a "for rent" sign on Sam's forehead.

16:11.190 --> 16:13.424
He's right, Woody.

16:13.603 --> 16:16.171
Friends with whom we share
a common vice

16:16.350 --> 16:19.220
sometimes reinforce our behaviour.

16:19.388 --> 16:22.917
I'm sure that's what's happening
in your case.

16:23.095 --> 16:26.501
Thank you, amateur psychologists...

16:28.054 --> 16:31.996
...for your simple-minded
diagnostic attempts.

16:32.175 --> 16:34.163
Now, Woody, tell me,

16:34.341 --> 16:36.575
do you come from
a strict moral upbringing?

16:37.089 --> 16:39.568
- What do you mean by that?
- Well,

16:39.747 --> 16:44.783
do you and Beth feel that
premarital relations are wrong?

16:44.951 --> 16:46.861
Well, I don't wanna talk about it.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.787
Beth and I feel there's some things
you just don't talk about.

16:49.954 --> 16:53.394
- Like what?
- I don't know. We never talk about it.

16:54.566 --> 16:56.197
Now listen to me, Woody.

16:56.365 --> 16:58.844
As healthy but moral
human beings,

16:59.022 --> 17:04.974
you and Beth sublimated your lust
into the sensual pleasure of eating.

17:05.142 --> 17:07.890
As your fondness grew,
so did your appetites.

17:08.057 --> 17:11.140
Well, in short, food became
your substitute for sex.

17:11.307 --> 17:13.630
Vera became mine.

17:15.964 --> 17:17.839
You really think that's what it is,
Dr Crane?

17:18.008 --> 17:19.750
Yes, it's quite common.
Well, for example,

17:19.929 --> 17:22.375
when Diane left Sam,
and he started drinking again,

17:22.541 --> 17:25.166
he was filling the void
that Diane left.

17:25.334 --> 17:27.790
And Diane filled her emptiness...

17:28.048 --> 17:33.375
...by toying with
and destroying a man

17:33.543 --> 17:36.703
who's her cultural and intellectual
superior in every way!

17:43.069 --> 17:45.771
You see the point
I'm trying to make, Woody.

17:46.531 --> 17:49.725
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- I rest my case.

17:50.071 --> 17:51.936
Go rest your mouth.

17:53.689 --> 17:58.224
Hey. You mean to tell me
you've never slept with Beth?

17:59.229 --> 18:02.222
Well, it's simple, then.
You sleep with her, you stop eating.

18:02.389 --> 18:04.880
What a great reason too.
I mean, as if you needed one.

18:05.058 --> 18:06.622
Sam, I can't do that.

18:06.801 --> 18:11.458
I can't ask a nice girl like Beth
to sleep with me out of wedlock.

18:11.625 --> 18:15.043
The younger generation.
I just don't know what to say to them.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.203
Why don't you just marry her?

18:18.706 --> 18:21.699
I don't think we're ready
for marriage yet.

18:23.955 --> 18:27.283
Forget Frasier's Freudian rantings.

18:27.450 --> 18:32.018
As anyone will tell you,
I am a Skinnerian behaviourist.

18:32.989 --> 18:35.189
I say we must address
your symptoms.

18:35.357 --> 18:39.645
You and Beth must learn to retrain
your eating habits together.

18:40.193 --> 18:43.599
We've thought about diets before.
All it does is make us hungrier.

18:43.766 --> 18:45.174
Well, then I'll help.

18:45.352 --> 18:50.166
I'll take you out to dinner and show you
how to eat a light but satisfying meal.

18:50.344 --> 18:51.919
Oh, well, I'll try anything.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.845
Hey, Sam, you wanna join us?

18:55.057 --> 18:59.256
Well, Sam could join us
if he so desires.

18:59.424 --> 19:01.412
We'll have a...

19:02.462 --> 19:05.577
...sparse but nutritious meal
and a lot of delightful conversation.

19:06.247 --> 19:09.285
Thanks, Diane, but I got something
a little more fun planned for myself.

19:09.453 --> 19:11.865
I'm gonna go home,
shave my head with a cheese grater

19:12.032 --> 19:14.601
while chewing on tinfoil.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.817
How about tomorrow night?

19:32.023 --> 19:34.424
- Wasn't it good?
- Yeah.

19:34.603 --> 19:37.049
Sam, can I tempt you
with the last piece of broccoli?

19:37.763 --> 19:40.466
Depends on what
you're gonna do with it.

19:42.342 --> 19:44.051
Aren't we just the trendsetters?

19:44.218 --> 19:47.826
It's not everyone that could walk
into an elite French restaurant

19:48.004 --> 19:49.713
and order nothing but vegetables.

19:49.881 --> 19:55.297
Yeah, I gotta admit, I don't feel as full
as if I had eaten food or something.

19:56.168 --> 19:58.402
Really, Diane, we appreciate
what you're trying to do,

19:58.580 --> 20:01.283
but what do you say we cleanse
our palate with some éclairs?

20:01.875 --> 20:03.662
Yo, waiter!

20:05.158 --> 20:07.693
Yes, a sense of humour's
very important when dieting.

20:08.699 --> 20:11.234
But remember, this one meal
isn't going to change your lives.

20:11.401 --> 20:13.936
You're going to have to continue
this way on your own.

20:15.064 --> 20:17.052
You think we can, Woody?

20:17.231 --> 20:19.900
Oh, sure.
Yeah, this was kind of nice.

20:20.067 --> 20:24.769
You know, I usually feel so full
I can't really do anything.

20:24.937 --> 20:26.925
- But now l...
- I know.

20:27.103 --> 20:30.174
I feel a lot more energetic.

20:30.353 --> 20:32.006
You know, I've been thinking

20:32.173 --> 20:35.758
about what the janitor at Cheers
said about sublimation.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.667
About what?

20:39.835 --> 20:43.621
Well, he said that, for us,
eating took the place of...

20:45.419 --> 20:47.909
Woody, maybe you should
go over to that table over there

20:48.077 --> 20:52.622
so you can be heard above
Sam's termite impression.

20:52.789 --> 20:54.990
Yeah, that might be better.

20:55.157 --> 20:57.402
I'm sorry.

21:04.817 --> 21:07.352
Eating took the place of what?

21:07.520 --> 21:11.384
Well, you know, that subject
that you don't like to talk about.

21:12.601 --> 21:14.265
What subject don't I like
to talk about?

21:14.433 --> 21:17.270
You know, that subject
that you never talk about.

21:17.928 --> 21:21.089
The reason we never talk about that is
because you don't wanna talk about it.

21:21.268 --> 21:23.468
I don't mind talking about it.

21:23.635 --> 21:26.662
In fact, I think about it all the time.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.627
Well, I don't mind
talking about it either.

21:28.795 --> 21:32.246
- In fact, I think about it too.
- You think about it too?

21:35.954 --> 21:37.495
Then maybe we should talk about it.

21:37.662 --> 21:39.739
Yeah, I think we should talk about it.

21:41.906 --> 21:45.770
You don't suppose there's a chance
we're not talking about the same thing.

21:45.949 --> 21:48.071
- No.
- No.

21:48.953 --> 21:51.432
Well, I think we've talked
about it enough.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.934
Me too.

21:55.274 --> 21:57.843
Well, I think we're gonna
be shoving off.

21:58.021 --> 21:59.685
Where are you going?

22:00.601 --> 22:02.098
We don't wanna talk about it.

22:03.561 --> 22:05.135
- I think I understand.
- Yeah.

22:07.056 --> 22:09.290
Understand what?

22:10.675 --> 22:12.718
Oh, yeah, right.

22:12.886 --> 22:15.879
Probably gonna get
something to eat, right?

22:17.174 --> 22:19.408
Don't be silly.

22:20.212 --> 22:22.825
- lsn't it beautiful?
- What's that?

22:23.004 --> 22:25.539
Two people in love.

22:26.455 --> 22:28.610
Yeah, you said it, all right.

22:30.833 --> 22:33.692
- What?
- I just had the funniest stray thought.

22:33.870 --> 22:35.769
Remember the first tryst
you and I shared?

22:36.618 --> 22:40.024
Yeah, I think I had
Cheez Whiz on my half.

22:46.066 --> 22:48.735
I'm talking about making love.

22:48.902 --> 22:50.968
I know.

22:54.062 --> 22:55.882
Yeah, of course I remember.

22:56.061 --> 22:59.088
It was... It was great, wasn't it?

22:59.266 --> 23:00.584
It was wonderful.

23:00.763 --> 23:04.046
Yeah, I think we gave new meaning
to the word "cooking."

23:05.677 --> 23:07.463
Sometimes I thought
it would go on forever.

23:07.631 --> 23:11.294
Hey, I came pretty darn close
a couple of times, didn't l?

23:14.041 --> 23:16.867
That's not what I meant.

23:20.787 --> 23:22.328
You were wonderful.

23:22.786 --> 23:25.321
Yeah, you were
pretty wonderful yourself.

23:26.829 --> 23:30.570
- It can be so wonderful, can't it, Sam?
- You bet.

23:32.111 --> 23:35.350
Thank God there's no danger
of all of that starting up again.

23:35.528 --> 23:38.689
Right. We know what kind of hell
that would lead to.

23:39.482 --> 23:41.548
Amen.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.115
Will there be anything else?

24:00.623 --> 24:03.538
- I want two of these. Keep it coming.
- Make it three.

24:03.705 --> 24:07.156
I think the word is "chocolate."
I want more chocolate.

24:07.915 --> 24:10.194
That's it. Go away. Go away.

24:13.321 --> 24:14.650
We must come back.
