WEBVTT

00:13.310 --> 00:18.896
Look at this, man,
I'm walking where
no one has walked before.

00:20.689 --> 00:22.137
We're back.

00:24.620 --> 00:30.172
<i>Nearly two months
into the season
at his new Nugget Creek claim,</i>

00:30.172 --> 00:34.379
<i>Dustin Hurt is almost ready
to start mining for gold.</i>

00:36.379 --> 00:37.827
Here, hold on.

00:37.827 --> 00:39.000
Hold on,
let me get up here.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.758
Yep.

00:40.758 --> 00:45.551
<i>But there is just
one final piece of the puzzle
to drag into place.</i>

00:45.551 --> 00:48.172
I think,
let me get over here now.

00:48.172 --> 00:49.551
All right, one more pull.

00:49.551 --> 00:54.068
Hold on, this is where
gonna get awkward.

00:54.068 --> 00:58.620
<i>A 35 foot,
200 pound suction hose...</i>

01:00.068 --> 01:02.206
[bleep] Foot by foot.

01:06.137 --> 01:07.724
- Good job you'll.
- Yeah.

01:09.068 --> 01:10.620
We made it.

01:11.896 --> 01:13.862
- That's it.
- Hey, we got a human winch.

01:13.862 --> 01:15.275
Human winch.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.965
Welcome to
the Golden Gates, baby.

01:18.310 --> 01:23.655
Everything is done by hand,
almost seems like back, willpower

01:25.448 --> 01:27.137
and the pursuit of gold, man.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.620
Ow!

01:31.620 --> 01:33.172
Are you stuck right now?

01:33.896 --> 01:35.827
Aw!

01:35.827 --> 01:37.448
That's gone.

01:37.448 --> 01:39.068
Be careful.

01:40.034 --> 01:42.310
What the hell,
look out.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.965
Whoa.

01:46.793 --> 01:48.724
Ain't nothing easy
about this.

01:48.724 --> 01:51.137
There's nothing easy
about anything we're doing.

01:51.137 --> 01:54.172
You're gonna die,
might as well die having fun.

01:54.172 --> 01:55.862
Woah!

01:57.034 --> 01:58.275
Oh, look out.

01:58.275 --> 02:01.517
Who the [bleep] does this
stupid [bleep]. Yeah.

02:01.517 --> 02:03.172
Uh-huh.

02:04.827 --> 02:06.206
You ready
to rock and roll?

02:08.241 --> 02:10.689
No.

02:10.689 --> 02:14.241
Hey gold hound, can you smell
the gold down there yet?

02:14.241 --> 02:17.862
Thinking, exactly how far
are we willing to go for gold?

02:25.482 --> 02:29.034
It's on now, time to dive.

02:30.344 --> 02:33.000
<i>So far this season,</i>

02:33.000 --> 02:35.482
<i>Dustin and his crew
have battled set up...</i>

02:35.482 --> 02:36.931
That
is so strong.

02:36.931 --> 02:40.379
<i>...and setbacks,
as they move
their entire operation</i>

02:40.379 --> 02:44.620
<i>to the most remote claim
they've ever taken on,
at Nugget Creek.</i>

02:45.793 --> 02:47.965
- Enough?
- Yeah, perfect.

02:47.965 --> 02:49.965
Yeah...

02:52.344 --> 02:54.965
Hose in place, check.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.206
- You ready?
- Pivot that back
this way.

02:59.206 --> 03:01.137
Yup, just like that.

03:05.413 --> 03:09.517
Whoo-hoo, she's in,
she floats once more.

03:09.517 --> 03:12.068
Wow, dude that looks pretty.

03:12.068 --> 03:14.344
<i>Now it's time
to find out</i>

03:14.344 --> 03:19.448
<i>if the gold they find
here will change
their lives forever.</i>

03:19.448 --> 03:23.620
Let me introduce you
to my little friend,
my moneymaker.

03:25.241 --> 03:27.482
I think
I got a nice spot right here

03:27.482 --> 03:29.482
where I think
we're gonna get lucky.

03:29.482 --> 03:31.827
I want to know
if the rumors were true,

03:31.827 --> 03:33.827
about gold in Nugget Creek.

03:33.827 --> 03:36.103
Hey, let's see if it lives up
to its name.

03:37.896 --> 03:43.517
<i>The fabled
Nugget Creek
was first staked in 1899.</i>

03:43.517 --> 03:47.172
<i>Rumor has it the claim
was barely mined</i>

03:47.172 --> 03:52.965
<i>by the brave few that survived
the 35 mile journey
into the frozen wilderness.</i>

03:55.827 --> 03:59.206
<i>But the draw of untold riches
lives on</i>

03:59.206 --> 04:04.620
<i>as a small group
of prospectors
in the '80s found big nuggets</i>

04:04.620 --> 04:08.931
<i>but were forced out
by Mother Nature
before they struck it rich.</i>

04:12.034 --> 04:15.448
It made it, we just
haven't run it for six months,

04:15.448 --> 04:18.793
I'm wondering if the engines
are gonna hate us.

04:18.793 --> 04:22.793
<i>Now Dustin
and his crew hope with their
advanced equipment</i>

04:22.793 --> 04:24.620
<i>and heated dive suits...</i>

04:25.206 --> 04:26.379
Are we ready?

04:26.379 --> 04:28.758
Let's wake her up
and see how she sings.

04:28.758 --> 04:32.827
<i>...they can conquer
the creek and return
home alive</i>

04:32.827 --> 04:35.931
<i>with a treasure chest
full of gold.</i>

04:35.931 --> 04:37.206
Fuel on.

04:37.206 --> 04:39.344
- Fuel on.
- Done. Choke.

04:39.344 --> 04:40.655
Throttle down.

04:54.517 --> 04:56.379
- Woah!
- She's alive.

04:59.551 --> 05:02.413
Carlos, it's dredging.

05:02.413 --> 05:05.448
Whoo-hoo,
I'm dredging.

05:05.448 --> 05:07.655
It's a good flow, I like it.

05:07.655 --> 05:10.448
She's hungry, we got a deal.

05:10.448 --> 05:13.137
If I feed her,
I get what's left.

05:13.137 --> 05:16.655
Gold, amigo! Gold!

05:16.655 --> 05:18.172
We all good?

05:19.689 --> 05:21.586
That's pretty good.

05:21.586 --> 05:25.931
So, the dredge is ready to go,
but outside of that,

05:25.931 --> 05:28.413
I've done the math,
we don't have enough fuel

05:28.413 --> 05:29.896
to make more
in a couple of days.

05:29.896 --> 05:33.034
So, I'm gonna go try to make
a fuel run of some sort

05:33.034 --> 05:35.931
and you guys are gonna be
on your own.

05:35.931 --> 05:38.068
- Okay.
- So, I'm gonna trust y'all,

05:38.068 --> 05:40.448
get in the water
and get your dive in.

05:40.448 --> 05:44.000
Okay, copy that, cool, cool.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.862
<i>At the start
of the season...</i>

05:45.862 --> 05:48.413
This water crossing's
kind of crazy, y'all.

05:48.413 --> 05:51.068
<i>Dustin could
drive his fuel supply</i>

05:51.068 --> 05:53.517
<i>up the still passable
Tsirku River.</i>

05:54.896 --> 05:57.000
I can't believe
we frickin' made it man.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.931
That was something.

05:58.931 --> 06:02.931
<i>But fed by five
rapidly thawing glaciers,</i>

06:02.931 --> 06:05.241
<i>the river is now impassable.</i>

06:06.827 --> 06:11.206
Whoo!

06:11.206 --> 06:14.793
<i>Three weeks ago,
Dustin devised a plan</i>

06:14.793 --> 06:17.448
<i>to use an airboat
to access his claim.</i>

06:18.896 --> 06:21.517
No, no, no, no. Oh!

06:21.517 --> 06:25.896
<i>But his
maiden voyage
nearly ended in disaster.</i>

06:25.896 --> 06:30.241
I think it's impossible
for me to bring
an entire crew of people

06:30.241 --> 06:33.344
up that river
without killing everybody.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.862
<i>Desperate for a solution,</i>

06:36.862 --> 06:39.586
<i>Dustin spent weeks
on a runway.</i>

06:39.586 --> 06:41.103
I know
it's a lot of work,

06:41.103 --> 06:43.103
but I think it's gonna be
worth it.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.137
<i>But the planes
capable of landing there</i>

06:46.137 --> 06:48.620
<i>aren't big enough
to carry enough fuel</i>

06:48.620 --> 06:50.793
<i>to keep
both his sites running.</i>

06:53.517 --> 06:58.310
<i>Now he needs to solve
the supply issue for good.</i>

06:58.310 --> 07:01.689
I have to get out of here
to get fuel back over here.

07:01.689 --> 07:04.896
I don't want
to leave the guys,
but they know what to do,

07:04.896 --> 07:06.827
so I'm gonna set them free
on the dredge,

07:06.827 --> 07:08.724
they're going to do
some dives.

07:08.724 --> 07:12.448
By the time I get back,
I'll have enough fuel
to run the show.

07:12.448 --> 07:15.068
<i>Supported by Scott Allen,</i>

07:15.068 --> 07:20.068
<i>Dustin makes the trip to town
in search of a solution
to their fuel crisis.</i>

07:29.448 --> 07:31.965
<i>Just remember,
my steps
are like a kid to you.</i>

07:34.344 --> 07:36.275
<i>Further up
Nugget Creek,</i>

07:38.068 --> 07:43.586
<i>Kayla Johanson and her crew
battle the hour-long deadly
hike to their dive site.</i>

07:46.379 --> 07:49.965
Because
we're so behind in the season
having relocated,

07:49.965 --> 07:51.896
<i>we're in a mad dash
to get dredging.</i>

07:53.862 --> 07:56.517
Oh, come on.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.862
We're losing our walkway.

07:57.862 --> 08:00.310
I know, that's crazy.

08:00.310 --> 08:04.586
That's snow bridge
is going very quickly,
not much of that left.

08:04.586 --> 08:06.344
I wouldn't walk
on that.

08:06.344 --> 08:09.310
I'm gonna say no,
sketchy walking over it

08:09.310 --> 08:10.793
and it's sketchy walking
under it.

08:15.206 --> 08:16.655
<i>For the last
two weeks,</i>

08:16.655 --> 08:19.655
<i>the crew has braved
the journey
to their dive site,</i>

08:19.655 --> 08:22.620
<i>crossing a 20-foot-thick
ice bridge.</i>

08:25.068 --> 08:30.379
<i>But the summer heat
and raging torrent has
brought it close to collapse.</i>

08:30.379 --> 08:32.931
It's not a rock,
but it's damn near close

08:32.931 --> 08:35.517
and could cause
just as much damage,

08:35.517 --> 08:37.206
sliced you open, pin you,

08:37.206 --> 08:39.655
and then
you're in the water stuck.

08:39.655 --> 08:42.275
I think if we try to cross it,
it's gonna collapse.

08:42.275 --> 08:48.172
Have one person go out front,
tie a rope to have a rope
line here, put our waders on.

08:48.172 --> 08:51.034
Yeah,
that looks like
our only option right now.

08:51.758 --> 08:53.310
I'll do it.

08:55.206 --> 08:57.137
It's gotten so thin that,

08:57.137 --> 08:59.482
I don't trust
if it's supporting
my body weight.

08:59.482 --> 09:01.655
And I'm the smallest person
here, so...

09:01.655 --> 09:03.413
If I don't trust it
to support me,

09:03.413 --> 09:05.724
I'm not gonna ask anyone else
to walk on it.

09:05.724 --> 09:07.482
So right now,
we're gonna set up a rope line

09:07.482 --> 09:11.482
just to get across the water
under the snow.

09:11.482 --> 09:15.827
It's a little fast,
but doesn't seem like
it's gonna be really deep.

09:16.413 --> 09:17.758
Whoa!

09:19.344 --> 09:21.034
For now,
we're on time crunch.

09:21.034 --> 09:24.034
Obviously, the snow has been
a huge delay for us,

09:24.034 --> 09:26.241
it's been problematic
as it changes

09:26.241 --> 09:29.620
and changes our path
to getting
to the site for dredging.

09:29.620 --> 09:31.413
Whoa!

09:31.413 --> 09:34.965
And now we've got
this overhang,
our goal today is to get up,

09:34.965 --> 09:37.931
so I can get the first
good dive in it.

09:37.931 --> 09:40.620
I don't want to be
under it when it comes down,
I can tell you that.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.034
Yeah, right where we walk,

09:42.034 --> 09:43.793
there's a steady stream
right there.

09:43.793 --> 09:44.965
Yeah.

09:44.965 --> 09:46.758
You know, that's
not gonna take very long.

09:46.758 --> 09:48.034
No.

09:48.034 --> 09:50.034
Yeah, I don't want
to be under this ice too long.

09:53.758 --> 09:55.000
She's coming,

09:55.000 --> 09:56.931
she's under over,
around the bend right now.

10:00.586 --> 10:01.965
You guys ready?

10:06.241 --> 10:08.655
What you thinking,
Paul?

10:08.655 --> 10:10.862
I'm just trying
to find something tie it to.

10:10.862 --> 10:12.310
All right.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.034
You wanna pass
the gas can?

10:15.034 --> 10:19.206
That's what I'm wanting.
I got this part right here.
This is the fast part.

10:19.206 --> 10:20.551
Yeah.

10:24.551 --> 10:26.137
- All, good.
- Yeah man.

10:26.137 --> 10:28.965
Watch this
rock right here,
I about... I about slipped.

10:28.965 --> 10:31.000
All right.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.482
I hate to be
underneath this thing. Yeah.

10:37.206 --> 10:38.344
Be careful.

10:38.344 --> 10:40.034
That's strong.

10:41.655 --> 10:43.034
[bleep] Dang it.

10:59.344 --> 11:00.896
Oh.

11:06.448 --> 11:10.034
Oh, we made it.

11:10.034 --> 11:13.241
<i>Over three hours
after leaving camp,</i>

11:13.241 --> 11:18.689
<i>just accessing their site
has burned nearly half
their dive day.</i>

11:18.689 --> 11:20.655
Water's cold
this morning.

11:20.655 --> 11:22.448
That is crazy.

11:22.448 --> 11:23.965
Yep.

11:23.965 --> 11:27.413
<i>To make up
for lost time, they need
a successful dive</i>

11:27.413 --> 11:29.827
<i>from new crew member
Justin Peterson.</i>

11:31.344 --> 11:33.931
I'm really hoping
to get a really good
first dive in.

11:33.931 --> 11:37.000
I'll get to be moving
some rocks today,
it's gonna be a good day.

11:42.931 --> 11:44.517
You look
like a sea lion.

11:45.896 --> 11:47.793
Because of the whiskers.

11:47.793 --> 11:50.448
Okay,
I gave you that one.

11:50.448 --> 11:54.172
This will be his first time
dredging on our crew.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.206
It's kind of a big day
for him,

11:56.206 --> 12:00.206
I'm sure he's pretty excited
and probably a bit nervous.

12:00.206 --> 12:02.344
I hope you have fun
with this hot water unit,

12:02.344 --> 12:03.793
it's gonna spoil you.

12:03.793 --> 12:07.206
Main objective today is not
so much to focus on depth

12:07.206 --> 12:08.931
as it is widening the holes.

12:08.931 --> 12:10.103
You ready?

12:10.103 --> 12:11.620
I was born ready.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.103
So, if we can
push forward and push out,

12:15.103 --> 12:17.206
it's just to clear
more surface area,

12:17.206 --> 12:19.379
that would be
a huge improvement

12:19.379 --> 12:21.137
and give us
a lot more working space.

12:21.137 --> 12:22.551
Are you having fun?

12:22.551 --> 12:23.793
Okay, all good.

12:23.793 --> 12:24.965
- All good.
- Yep.

12:24.965 --> 12:26.241
All right.

12:29.344 --> 12:32.448
All right, let's get down
to business.

12:35.379 --> 12:38.758
Yee-haw.
I feel like a penguin.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.655
All right,
where are we heading?

12:46.965 --> 12:49.689
<i>Nugget Creek
legends suggest bedrock</i>

12:49.689 --> 12:53.344
<i>is just eight to 10 feet deep.</i>

12:53.344 --> 12:58.827
<i>If true, Kayla's crew
should be dredging
bedrock gold in no time.</i>

13:07.103 --> 13:08.551
How's the hot water?

13:09.413 --> 13:10.793
Boiling me.

13:10.793 --> 13:12.724
Like sitting in a bathtub.

13:12.724 --> 13:16.344
Oh, my goodness,
I'm where I was meant
to be again, finally.

13:16.344 --> 13:18.827
I'm really happy that
we're actually dredging now,

13:18.827 --> 13:21.000
it's been a lot of setup
to get here,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.689
but it feels really good
to actually be
making some progress.

13:24.689 --> 13:26.620
I want to see
those nuggets.

13:26.620 --> 13:28.655
We do this
for the love of gold.

13:33.482 --> 13:34.862
<i>Up ahead...</i>

13:34.862 --> 13:36.379
I don't understand
what's happening.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.758
Is he trapped?

13:39.758 --> 13:42.448
What the hell?
Look out! Woah!

13:42.448 --> 13:44.827
You're about
to get burned,
just take his hot water off.

13:44.827 --> 13:46.275
Take his hot water off.

13:48.137 --> 13:51.068
It's not easy,
ain't nothing easy about this.

13:51.068 --> 13:52.689
I ain't got time
for this [bleep].

14:00.206 --> 14:02.482
And I'm gonna get dressed up
and rock and roll dude.

14:02.482 --> 14:03.896
All right,
rock and roll.

14:03.896 --> 14:06.965
<i>At the remote
Golden Gates dive site...</i>

14:06.965 --> 14:10.034
This is all
more gas that we got.

14:10.034 --> 14:13.448
That's about all he has,
a couple of hours,
I guess.

14:13.448 --> 14:16.689
... <i>Dustin's crew
are desperate to keep
their dredge running,</i>

14:17.655 --> 14:20.448
<i>despite being down
their leader.</i>

14:20.448 --> 14:23.551
Today marks a good day
that we're moving forward,

14:23.551 --> 14:25.034
finally getting on mission,

14:25.034 --> 14:27.275
it's our first dive
in the water.

14:27.275 --> 14:29.310
<i>Unfortunately, Dus...
Dustin couldn't be here,</i>

14:29.310 --> 14:34.620
<i>he's doing fuel runs,
since we have no fuel.</i>

14:34.620 --> 14:38.413
Very little, we're just
working on fumes right now.

14:38.413 --> 14:41.068
We need to get in the water
now and get the dredging.

14:41.068 --> 14:44.689
I'm hoping
that we can dig down
pretty deep today.

14:44.689 --> 14:48.379
<i>The dredge hasn't
caught any gold all winter.</i>

14:48.379 --> 14:52.068
<i>It also suffered the terrible
journey up the SACU</i>

14:52.068 --> 14:55.965
<i>and was dragged by winch
over the boulder
infested nugget creek.</i>

14:56.724 --> 14:58.103
- All right, guys.
- Oh, yeah.

14:58.103 --> 15:00.896
Let's do it, man.
We're at least about
three weeks behind, man.

15:00.896 --> 15:02.413
- Oh, man.
- You got to make up
for it.

15:02.413 --> 15:03.689
Let's see what we got.

15:03.689 --> 15:05.413
Day one.

15:05.413 --> 15:09.896
<i>But it's the only
tool that will get them
to the riches down deep.</i>

15:10.965 --> 15:12.689
- This is exciting.
- First dive.

15:13.448 --> 15:15.068
Good? You got air?

15:15.068 --> 15:16.241
Yeah, man.

15:16.241 --> 15:17.620
Wouldn't we be lucky, man,

15:17.620 --> 15:19.068
if we just find gold, right?

15:20.137 --> 15:22.344
Okay Carlos,
have a good dive today.

15:22.344 --> 15:24.344
All right,
guys, going in.

15:26.275 --> 15:27.655
Diver in the water.

15:31.172 --> 15:32.482
Diver in the water.

15:34.586 --> 15:38.689
All right, I'm just
gonna just find the nozzle
and start dredging guys.

15:39.793 --> 15:42.034
Damn, man, its beautiful man,
it's beautiful,

15:42.034 --> 15:43.551
even though I can't see it.

15:43.551 --> 15:44.862
I have a feeling, man.

15:44.862 --> 15:47.275
We're gonna make our frickin'
millions here.

15:47.275 --> 15:49.344
I'm just gonna start
right here

15:49.344 --> 15:51.068
and work my way up
to that Asteroid Boulder.

15:52.827 --> 15:58.103
<i>The massive
Asteroid Boulder sits in
the middle of their dive site.</i>

15:58.103 --> 16:02.344
<i>For thousands of years,
it has slowed
the fast-flowing creek,</i>

16:02.344 --> 16:06.379
<i>which should have
caused a huge buildup
of gold nuggets beneath it.</i>

16:10.379 --> 16:11.724
<i>Now...</i>

16:11.724 --> 16:15.482
Dredging,
we're moving material now.

16:15.482 --> 16:18.931
<i>...the crew used
advanced gold catching technology</i>

16:18.931 --> 16:21.620
<i>unthinkable to the old timers</i>

16:21.620 --> 16:26.448
<i>who were forced from Nugget
Creek by Mother Nature
over 100 years ago.</i>

16:28.275 --> 16:29.931
First dive, man.

16:30.896 --> 16:33.137
We got a little bit of work
to do,

16:33.137 --> 16:34.724
we'll get down
to the bedrock.

16:36.103 --> 16:37.862
Let's get some gold.

16:38.724 --> 16:40.172
Let's get some gold.

16:40.931 --> 16:42.103
Whoo-hoo!

16:49.586 --> 16:51.413
<i>600 feet up creek,</i>

16:52.448 --> 16:55.551
<i>Justin is two hours
into his first dive,</i>

16:58.379 --> 17:04.103
<i>fighting water
three times faster
than he's ever dived before.</i>

17:04.103 --> 17:05.965
<i>Hey Justin.</i>

17:05.965 --> 17:07.586
- <i>What's up?</i>
- <i>How's your air?</i>

17:07.586 --> 17:10.137
<i>It's pretty good,
are you able to hear me?</i>

17:10.137 --> 17:13.068
Yeah, just making sure that
you didn't need more airflow.

17:14.862 --> 17:18.344
Having a new person
and it's being
their first dive,

17:18.344 --> 17:21.758
it's always a little tricky,
because they're getting
used to new gear,

17:21.758 --> 17:24.000
they're getting used
to the way that we do things,

17:24.000 --> 17:25.896
they're getting used
to a lot of different things.

17:26.862 --> 17:28.482
<i>Little cloudy
down here.</i>

17:28.482 --> 17:31.827
<i>Yeah, the water's
a little bit murky.</i>

17:31.827 --> 17:34.482
<i>Yeah, no kidding,
lot of hill side wash in here.</i>

17:34.482 --> 17:35.931
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:35.931 --> 17:38.241
The water definitely
came up a little bit.

17:38.241 --> 17:39.724
Is it raining up top?

17:39.724 --> 17:41.137
Oh, yeah.

17:43.896 --> 17:48.379
<i>Nugget Creek
is boxed in by 500 foot
sheer cliffs.</i>

17:50.413 --> 17:55.172
<i>The geographical funnel
means any rain
higher up the mountain</i>

17:55.172 --> 17:58.862
<i>could result
in flash floods below.</i>

17:58.862 --> 18:02.000
<i>Hey Justin I think
we're gonna wrap it
up here pretty soon</i>

18:02.000 --> 18:03.310
<i>if you want to go ahead,
come up.</i>

18:03.310 --> 18:04.724
<i>All right.</i>

18:04.724 --> 18:07.379
If the water gets too
bad, then I can't have
a diver in the water

18:07.379 --> 18:11.310
and I can't be the diver
in the water.

18:11.310 --> 18:15.103
We've got to keep everybody
safe, it's... there's no gold
worth getting killed for,

18:15.103 --> 18:19.827
our protocol is to pull out,
tie everything off,
get out of here.

18:19.827 --> 18:23.931
Because if we get trapped
in here, there's no way to go,

18:23.931 --> 18:26.034
we got to get out of here.

18:26.034 --> 18:31.448
<i>Their only way out
is by waiting under
the collapsing ice bridge,</i>

18:31.448 --> 18:37.620
<i>any surge in the creek could
either trap or kill them.</i>

18:37.620 --> 18:41.379
[bleep]
Dang it.

18:55.793 --> 18:57.103
You want me
to pull this tight for you?

18:57.103 --> 18:58.758
- Pull it tight.
- Okay.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.586
- That rope's
way too loose.
- It is.

19:03.931 --> 19:06.172
Yeah, once you catch
that little leg of current,

19:06.172 --> 19:07.758
that's where you're getting

19:07.758 --> 19:10.275
All right, he's just about
here into the corner.

19:16.103 --> 19:19.137
I'm glad I came through first
with the lightest one.

19:19.137 --> 19:22.172
I'll let you go,
I'll keep the tension
while you get up there.

19:24.172 --> 19:26.000
The water
is just too crazy.

19:28.172 --> 19:34.586
We just start changing
our focus to start looking
at making our walkways.

19:34.586 --> 19:37.172
<i>To collect
the riches on bedrock,</i>

19:37.172 --> 19:41.620
<i>Kayla's crew
must dive all day,
every day.</i>

19:41.620 --> 19:45.448
<i>We know that
our walkway needs to extend
all the way up high.</i>

19:45.448 --> 19:49.275
We'll come up with a plan
and then figure that out.

19:49.275 --> 19:53.931
<i>Pulling out every
time the creek rises
will cripple her operation.</i>

19:55.793 --> 20:00.103
<i>Their only option
is to extend the walkway.</i>

20:00.103 --> 20:01.965
Can have two people working
on the walkway

20:01.965 --> 20:03.517
and then two people making
some board.

20:03.517 --> 20:04.586
- Okay.
- That would be nice.

20:04.586 --> 20:05.758
All right.

20:05.758 --> 20:07.758
I can start on the walkways
with the core drill,

20:07.758 --> 20:09.448
I could probably use
Justin over here.

20:09.448 --> 20:11.068
- Okay.
- We can
do it like that for the start.

20:11.068 --> 20:14.310
But I think if we can
get the pipe in just
for the each end,

20:14.310 --> 20:17.172
in the middle of each board,
I think we can get a walkway
fairly quick.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.068
<i>That sounds good,
I think I like that plan.</i>

20:25.862 --> 20:28.344
<i>All right,
you ready for this?</i>

20:28.344 --> 20:30.896
<i>Nine miles down
the Tsirku River</i>

20:30.896 --> 20:34.172
<i>with no other affordable way
into Nugget Creek,</i>

20:34.172 --> 20:37.896
<i>Dustin and Scott are about
to attempt the impossible.</i>

20:41.655 --> 20:47.068
It's the most nervous
I've been
in probably 20 years.

20:47.068 --> 20:51.862
I am about to do
the craziest thing I've done
in a very, very long time,

20:51.862 --> 20:56.206
trying to take a Florida
Airboat up to Tsirku,

20:56.206 --> 20:57.620
which is a crazy river.

20:59.931 --> 21:03.620
I have to find
an alternative way to get
to the claim,

21:03.620 --> 21:06.862
otherwise, this is done.

21:06.862 --> 21:09.517
This is the only way
to get fuel out there

21:09.517 --> 21:12.827
that doesn't cost
an immense amount of money,

21:12.827 --> 21:16.241
the airboat is basically
my only solution.

21:17.413 --> 21:18.965
Let's go for a ride.

21:18.965 --> 21:20.862
Let's take a ride,
see if this works.

21:22.586 --> 21:24.620
Well, it'll either work
or it won't.

21:26.068 --> 21:27.965
Pass, fail.

21:27.965 --> 21:30.482
<i>Nothing beneath
its flat hull,</i>

21:30.482 --> 21:36.275
<i>Dustin's airboat is the only
craft capable of navigating
the wild Tsirku River.</i>

21:36.275 --> 21:37.862
Hope it's ready.

21:38.724 --> 21:41.103
Mission control,
we are go for launch.

21:41.103 --> 21:43.793
If we're gonna die,
might as well die having fun.

21:45.758 --> 21:48.827
Ready, rock and roll.

21:48.827 --> 21:52.896
<i>Driven by
a 450 horsepower
aircraft propeller...</i>

21:54.689 --> 21:56.379
Whoo!

21:58.448 --> 22:00.206
Yeah.

22:00.206 --> 22:05.758
<i>...novice skipper
Dustin will skillfully
navigate at 30 miles an hour,</i>

22:05.758 --> 22:07.689
<i>to keep the bow
out of the water...</i>

22:09.000 --> 22:11.137
I don't know
about you,
but I can't feel my hands.

22:12.689 --> 22:16.275
<i>...while avoiding
an endless stream
of sandbanks and logs.</i>

22:21.862 --> 22:23.620
It's a lot of water.

22:23.620 --> 22:25.448
It's a little hard to see.

22:29.103 --> 22:30.965
Oh [bleep]!

22:32.206 --> 22:34.206
- Look out!
- Whoa.

22:45.655 --> 22:48.172
Whoo! Yeah!

22:48.172 --> 22:50.517
I don't know about you,
but I can't feel my hands.

22:51.758 --> 22:55.689
<i>In a desperate
attempt to fuel his operation,</i>

22:55.689 --> 22:59.655
<i>Dustin Hurt has thrown caution
to the wind.</i>

23:04.724 --> 23:08.137
It's a lot of water.
It's a little hard to see.

23:09.862 --> 23:11.206
Holy [bleep].

23:11.206 --> 23:12.551
Look out!

23:12.551 --> 23:14.379
Woah.

23:30.137 --> 23:32.206
That was
a nice parking job.

23:33.517 --> 23:34.827
Whoo!

23:36.172 --> 23:38.206
We did it.

23:40.931 --> 23:43.379
Hot rod,
that's what this is, man.

23:43.379 --> 23:46.068
- This is.
- It's just
a nice hot rod.

23:46.068 --> 23:48.586
<i>That is
what I call a success.</i>

23:48.586 --> 23:50.620
I would agree.

23:50.620 --> 23:53.413
How long did that take,
by the way,
did you get it timed?

23:53.413 --> 23:55.068
Less than an hour.

23:55.068 --> 23:59.413
So right now, the airboats
are gonna be the answer
to our fuel problem.

23:59.413 --> 24:04.965
Ah, we're about $30
per ride right now.

24:04.965 --> 24:08.827
<i>I can get three barrels here
with one helicopter for $1,700</i>

24:08.827 --> 24:12.482
<i>or two fuel barrels
for 30 bucks.</i>

24:12.482 --> 24:16.931
<i>So, it's worth
the extra hour of driving,
or two hours of driving.</i>

24:16.931 --> 24:19.620
<i>And if I keep doing that,
we'll always have fuel,</i>

24:19.620 --> 24:22.068
and I... and it's just my time
and effort.

24:24.241 --> 24:26.724
All right, let's get
out of here.

24:31.586 --> 24:33.241
<i>Hey, Wes,
can you hear me?</i>

24:33.241 --> 24:35.724
<i>Yeah, I can hear you.</i>

24:35.724 --> 24:38.344
<i>Up at
the Golden Gates dive site,</i>

24:38.344 --> 24:43.103
<i>Carlos is four hours
into the first dive
of the season,</i>

24:43.103 --> 24:46.413
<i>stretching their limited gas supplies.</i>

24:46.413 --> 24:50.000
<i>I'm just gonna start
right here and worked my way
up to the Asteroid Boulder.</i>

24:50.000 --> 24:54.482
<i>His target,
the behemoth Asteroid Boulder,</i>

24:54.482 --> 24:57.310
<i>hopeful big boulders
mean big gold.</i>

25:02.689 --> 25:04.586
Oh, [bleep].

25:04.586 --> 25:06.137
We're out of gas.

25:06.137 --> 25:07.620
What's going on?

25:08.310 --> 25:09.655
He's on fumes.

25:10.448 --> 25:12.310
Damn it.

25:12.310 --> 25:15.172
<i>Hey Carlos, Carlos
come up, because your air...</i>

25:15.172 --> 25:16.965
<i>your engine
just ran out of gas.</i>

25:16.965 --> 25:18.448
You got to be
kidding me.

25:18.448 --> 25:20.137
We need to go
get some more fuel.

25:24.068 --> 25:25.620
Not quite fast enough.

25:27.793 --> 25:29.413
Damn it.

25:32.517 --> 25:37.137
<i>But less than
five minutes after one of
their motors shut down,</i>

25:37.137 --> 25:41.517
<i>the crew catch a break,
crossing Dustin
on the trail, back to camp.</i>

25:41.517 --> 25:43.137
Uh [bleep].

25:43.137 --> 25:45.137
<i>James has returned...</i>

25:48.413 --> 25:53.517
<i>...loaded with vital gas,
to keep the operation alive.</i>

25:53.517 --> 25:58.034
It just went out of gas
right now, that's perfect.

25:58.034 --> 26:01.137
So, luckily, we're getting
right back in, no downtime.

26:02.068 --> 26:03.862
Start it up now,
let's fill it up.

26:14.172 --> 26:16.068
That was awesome.

26:17.620 --> 26:20.344
Got air,
I'm breathing good guys.

26:23.896 --> 26:25.137
Perfect timing.

26:25.137 --> 26:26.482
You're good to go.

26:26.482 --> 26:29.241
Right here,
this is that nose
of that Asteroid Boulder.

26:31.103 --> 26:34.379
<i>I'd really
like to know if it's sitting
on bedrock.</i>

26:34.379 --> 26:37.448
<i>I've... me too,
I'm trying to figure that out.</i>

26:38.482 --> 26:40.137
All right, going in.

26:42.241 --> 26:45.068
Right here, man, I got pieces
of frickin' asteroid rock.

26:45.068 --> 26:47.551
Hey, man,
they can give you
a basket if you want it.

26:47.551 --> 26:48.896
<i>Yeah,
that'll be good.</i>

27:08.448 --> 27:10.137
I'll take this basket.

27:10.758 --> 27:12.379
Thank you, guys.

27:21.241 --> 27:24.379
Check this out,
I'm underneath the sluice

27:24.379 --> 27:25.758
of this Asteroid Boulder.

27:25.758 --> 27:27.379
That makes me happy.

27:30.137 --> 27:33.000
Yo, those tubes
are getting hot
and starting to smoke.

27:35.275 --> 27:38.620
Carlos, it's getting
real hot on the
hoses back here,

27:38.620 --> 27:41.448
so you're about to get burnt,
is what I'm guessing.

27:43.655 --> 27:44.896
<i>Five years ago...</i>

27:46.827 --> 27:48.448
Get it off,

27:48.448 --> 27:50.344
get it off, get it off,
get it off,
get it off, get it off...

27:50.344 --> 27:53.275
<i>...Carlos's hot water
system overheated...</i>

27:53.275 --> 27:55.137
Get it off,
come on. Get it off.

27:55.137 --> 27:56.517
It's not coming off.

27:56.517 --> 27:58.586
Oh my [bleep].

27:58.586 --> 28:01.586
<i>...giving him
third degree burns.</i>

28:01.586 --> 28:03.241
<i>That pain
was so un-describable,</i>

28:03.241 --> 28:06.068
I had white light
just shooting through
my whole body.

28:09.931 --> 28:12.551
Take his
hot water off,
take his hot water off.

28:13.896 --> 28:15.068
Let's go.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.310
What happened.

28:16.310 --> 28:17.448
- Pull it.
- What?

28:17.448 --> 28:20.344
It's steaming.

28:21.689 --> 28:23.586
It's that
second filter so stopped up,

28:23.586 --> 28:24.793
it's not gonna work at all.

28:24.793 --> 28:27.517
Holy moly, man.

28:27.517 --> 28:29.275
Wow.

28:30.344 --> 28:32.172
Hey, you know,
it's all right though,

28:32.172 --> 28:34.000
you guys did a good job,
thank you.

28:36.068 --> 28:39.103
Is there always a concern
about danger,

28:39.103 --> 28:43.758
death and destruction because
of frickin' hot water filters
getting all clogged up?

28:43.758 --> 28:44.896
Yes.

28:44.896 --> 28:48.413
But since we've been
doing this for quite a while,

28:48.413 --> 28:52.758
we have learned from our
mistakes, and that's why
we're calm and collected.

28:56.793 --> 28:58.620
What we
didn't count on today

28:58.620 --> 29:01.379
was the water turning so dirty

29:01.379 --> 29:04.172
that it caused one
of the hoses to start melting.

29:04.172 --> 29:09.206
Another 45 minutes and Carlos
would have been cooked again.

29:09.206 --> 29:11.620
<i>In the unforgiving
wilderness of Nugget Creek...</i>

29:14.068 --> 29:15.586
Not one speck.

29:16.758 --> 29:19.758
<i>...your luck
can turn on a dime.</i>

29:19.758 --> 29:22.103
How far down
do you think you dug?

29:22.103 --> 29:24.862
Ahh, about four
and a half, five feet, maybe.

29:24.862 --> 29:26.448
Wow.

29:26.448 --> 29:30.413
We still have a ways to go,
it's not on bedrock.

29:30.413 --> 29:33.000
We picked an area
that's great for gold,

29:33.000 --> 29:34.758
but really hard to work in.

29:34.758 --> 29:39.206
We'll find out exactly
how much gold is under
all those giant rocks,

29:39.206 --> 29:41.551
but it's gonna be
a hell of a process.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.896
Oh look, we have got
much further to go.

30:05.206 --> 30:06.344
Behave.

30:07.862 --> 30:11.758
All right, I got to get it
to you.

30:15.034 --> 30:21.931
<i>Overnight, the ice
bridge to Kayla's dive site
has completely collapsed.</i>

30:21.931 --> 30:23.241
- Ready?
- Yeah.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.655
Yep, we're on the pipe.

30:31.413 --> 30:33.448
<i>To carve out
a new route,</i>

30:33.448 --> 30:36.448
<i>Paul and Justin are forced
to risk their lives,</i>

30:36.448 --> 30:39.758
<i>suspended 20 feet
above the raging creek below.</i>

30:41.896 --> 30:44.551
Still not there,
we're almost
around the corner.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.137
Well,
we got one more you think?

30:46.137 --> 30:47.517
Yeah.

30:47.517 --> 30:49.448
That's gonna be
a weird spot, too.

30:49.448 --> 30:52.517
Yeah, I might be
right out on that bend.

30:52.517 --> 30:56.000
<i>But now that we're going
up on a steep incline,
it's a lot harder.</i>

30:56.000 --> 30:57.586
Right now,
I'll be glad to get
this done,

30:57.586 --> 30:59.103
I'm tired
of hanging off that rope.

31:01.448 --> 31:05.620
It's a lot of work trying
to get this to our dive
site so we can work.

31:05.620 --> 31:08.724
The only good thing about
that is if it's this hard
to get to,

31:08.724 --> 31:11.000
not too many people
have done this.

31:13.310 --> 31:15.896
I'm wondering,

31:15.896 --> 31:19.344
if I can go snag
that extension ladder.

31:19.344 --> 31:23.620
<i>Veteran miner Paul
knows that to succeed
in this environment,</i>

31:24.862 --> 31:28.620
working smarter,
not harder is key.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.758
I know I don't have
much of a choice to do this,

31:34.275 --> 31:36.068
but hopefully
I can get this to work.

31:46.482 --> 31:48.620
This fin is sticking out
right here,
we got to get around,

31:48.620 --> 31:51.034
it's probably
the worst part of this
whole entire rock wall.

32:04.931 --> 32:07.896
I'm gonna find
some secure rock somewhere.

32:10.137 --> 32:12.068
My best bet is gonna be
right in there.

32:13.758 --> 32:17.448
This is not
the easiest conditions
to be working in right here.

32:17.448 --> 32:20.137
No, you're not supposed
to do this on the ladder.

32:20.137 --> 32:22.206
Yeah, it's so far
out there, you're
doing it with one arm

32:22.206 --> 32:26.172
while you hold on
to the ladder, that's asking
for a lot of danger.

32:42.931 --> 32:44.275
Wow.

32:44.275 --> 32:46.275
I appreciate
you doing this.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I hope everybody
else does, too.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.931
I'm definitely in the mood
for any criticism.

32:55.172 --> 32:58.000
And I'd like to see
those two come hang
off this and do this.

33:04.448 --> 33:09.206
<i>Back at camp,
Kayla and Scott have
milled their own boards</i>

33:09.206 --> 33:11.275
<i>to complete the walkway.</i>

33:11.275 --> 33:13.172
Hi, Paul.

33:14.482 --> 33:15.862
Nice to see you, too.

33:17.344 --> 33:21.517
Hey Paul, we got
one eight-footer,

33:21.517 --> 33:26.517
one nine-footer
and four six-footers.

33:26.517 --> 33:28.551
I don't want
the six-footers.

33:28.551 --> 33:30.068
That means
more holes.

33:30.068 --> 33:31.724
That means more holes.

33:39.241 --> 33:40.827
I don't know
why they cut them six-foot,

33:40.827 --> 33:42.379
I told him eight-foot
for a reason.

33:42.379 --> 33:44.448
Oh, yeah, six-foot
board is easy to carry,

33:44.448 --> 33:46.275
more [bleep] holes to drill.

33:46.275 --> 33:49.655
They think they're doing
themselves a favor by
making that [bleep] lighter,

33:49.655 --> 33:52.103
but it just creates
more work elsewhere.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.034
You can't use six.

33:55.034 --> 33:57.068
It's gonna take
everything I got just to do

33:57.068 --> 33:58.758
a run that we have
at eight feet.

33:58.758 --> 34:02.413
You can gladly come hang
off the side and drill them.

34:02.413 --> 34:04.620
Everybody needs experience
hanging off this

34:04.620 --> 34:06.551
and drilling these holes.

34:06.551 --> 34:08.310
Both of you'll.

34:08.310 --> 34:11.137
You want to hang off
and drill these,
this is not easy,

34:11.137 --> 34:13.172
ain't nothing easy
about this.

34:13.172 --> 34:15.241
There's nothing
easy about anything
we're doing.

34:15.241 --> 34:18.689
This... you'll are
more than welcome

34:18.689 --> 34:20.724
all to try and to get
a feel for it.

34:21.862 --> 34:24.206
I ain't got time
for the [bleep].

34:39.068 --> 34:41.103
It's real hard keeping
this pace,

34:41.103 --> 34:43.000
we've been
really getting after it.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.413
<i>Dustin's mining
operation is weeks
behind schedule</i>

34:47.793 --> 34:49.931
<i>and slipping further
by the day.</i>

34:49.931 --> 34:53.344
Urgh! Where do we go
from here?

34:53.344 --> 34:58.758
<i>The Nugget Creek dream
is fast becoming a nightmare.</i>

34:58.758 --> 35:00.413
I mean, this is
our first season here.

35:00.413 --> 35:04.103
I mean, this expected
that we're not gonna
have everything dialed in.

35:04.103 --> 35:06.482
I know
it's been a long road,

35:06.482 --> 35:08.448
but we got to start
seeing some gold.

35:08.448 --> 35:10.103
We have to stop paying
for some of this stuff.

35:10.103 --> 35:11.586
Man, we start
seeing color, man.

35:11.586 --> 35:13.000
We're gonna get
our second win, man.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.068
Then we're gonna have
to make up for the time
that we lost.

35:15.068 --> 35:16.896
I mean, we didn't squander
it, man.

35:16.896 --> 35:20.103
We built
the whole civilization
in one frickin' month.

35:20.103 --> 35:21.241
Yeah, that ain't no lie,

35:21.241 --> 35:23.586
let's stay focused
and we need to get
in the water

35:23.586 --> 35:24.689
and find some gold.

35:24.689 --> 35:26.000
Here on out, its gold time.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.482
So that means
at the end of the day,

35:27.482 --> 35:28.965
somebody is coming
out of the water

35:28.965 --> 35:30.655
the next morning, somebody's
going in the water...

35:30.655 --> 35:32.655
- Yeah.
- ...so that's rinse
and repeat, man.

35:32.655 --> 35:34.896
Dredge, dredge,
dredge, gold, gold, gold.

35:34.896 --> 35:37.482
Everybody, we're getting
tired right now.

35:37.482 --> 35:40.413
Two rules, don't get hurt,
don't die.

35:40.413 --> 35:41.931
- You guys ready again?
- Yeah.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.827
Let's go round up
the rest of the stuff we need

35:43.827 --> 35:45.448
for the dredge
and get at it.

35:46.827 --> 35:49.758
<i>To get the gold
they came for,</i>

35:49.758 --> 35:56.137
<i>the crew must work together
to overcome every barrier
brought on by the creek.</i>

36:00.586 --> 36:02.413
Paul, I love you.

36:02.413 --> 36:06.344
I love you guys, too,
I'm sorry I get mad,
but it's frustrating.

36:06.344 --> 36:08.586
We're just... I mean,
we're... it's like
brothers and sisters,

36:08.586 --> 36:10.206
they fight,

36:10.206 --> 36:11.758
that's kind of where
we are right now.

36:11.758 --> 36:13.965
It's just pushing
everybody to their limits,

36:13.965 --> 36:15.965
but it's all good,
we worked everything out.

36:18.206 --> 36:21.896
Hey, guess what, this isn't
the last section of walkway.

36:21.896 --> 36:23.517
We're about to have
a walkway.

36:23.517 --> 36:24.551
Don't jinx it.

36:24.551 --> 36:26.344
One board away.

36:26.344 --> 36:27.965
Shut up.

36:46.310 --> 36:47.793
Be smart.
Stand with it.

36:47.793 --> 36:49.275
Take it all the way
to the dirt.

36:49.275 --> 36:51.379
You come away from that edge
right there, yeah.

36:51.379 --> 36:52.724
Yeah.

36:52.724 --> 36:55.448
That's it, dude,
we got to walk away.

36:55.448 --> 36:57.758
We got a [bleep] bad ass walkway.

37:02.827 --> 37:04.896
Good job, man.

37:04.896 --> 37:07.862
Dude, you and I put in
some [bleep] on this walkway.

37:07.862 --> 37:10.068
We're finally at the point
where it's time

37:10.068 --> 37:14.241
to just go balls to the walls,
dredge and finally
get some gold.

37:14.241 --> 37:16.344
<i>Over a month of setup,</i>

37:16.344 --> 37:21.275
<i>Kayla's crew now have
a clear route
to their dive site</i>

37:21.275 --> 37:24.310
<i>and a clear run
at the bedrock goal.</i>

37:24.310 --> 37:27.758
I feel like things are
gonna start getting in a...
into a better rhythm now.

37:27.758 --> 37:30.965
We're here to mine gold,
we're here to dredge, that's
what we came here to do.

37:41.103 --> 37:43.655
<i>I'm really hoping that
there's good gold today.</i>

37:45.931 --> 37:47.931
Here we are, we're dredging.
We're back at it.

37:49.896 --> 37:52.724
<i>Now, I got
great suction.</i>

37:52.724 --> 37:56.896
<i>Hopefully we start
seeing something soon
and that would be gold.</i>

38:05.172 --> 38:06.793
So, it'll be
three filters.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.551
<i>600 feet
down creek...</i>

38:10.551 --> 38:12.310
All right, start it up.

38:12.310 --> 38:18.310
<i>...Dustin's crew
take every measure to ensure
diver James's safety.</i>

38:18.310 --> 38:23.310
I just want to be
in the right mentally prepared
for a dangerous dive job.

38:23.310 --> 38:26.103
When you don't have
everything set up properly,

38:26.724 --> 38:28.482
it causes problems.

38:31.931 --> 38:33.517
The water line
should be clear

38:33.517 --> 38:36.206
because we've run
water through all of them,
so it flows good.

38:36.206 --> 38:40.241
<i>After narrowly
avoiding burning Carlos
with scalding water,</i>

38:42.206 --> 38:46.068
<i>Wes was forced to completely
overhaul their filter system.</i>

38:48.793 --> 38:51.275
Hope that this works.

38:51.275 --> 38:55.862
Hope that nobody has
to come close to a tragedy.

38:55.862 --> 38:59.137
Thinking exactly how far
are we willing to go for gold?

39:07.793 --> 39:09.206
How's that?

39:09.862 --> 39:11.379
That feels good.

39:25.931 --> 39:28.000
All right, you ready
to rock and roll.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.586
Ready to rock
and roll.

39:29.586 --> 39:33.689
Okay, James, gonna
have fun on your first dive,
have a great dive, buddy.

39:33.689 --> 39:35.689
I hope so, man.

39:36.551 --> 39:37.931
First dive at nugget.

39:43.344 --> 39:46.379
My goal is to get nuggets,

39:46.379 --> 39:48.758
otherwise I wouldn't want
to be in the water.

39:52.413 --> 39:54.068
That's a rough spot to dig.

39:57.379 --> 40:01.068
Hey gold hound can you smell
the gold down there yet?

40:01.068 --> 40:05.931
[laughs] It's
going down, the heat's
going down, down, down.

40:20.068 --> 40:21.551
I don't understand
what's happening.

40:21.551 --> 40:23.379
Are you stuck right now?

40:26.310 --> 40:28.241
Is he trapped?

40:29.241 --> 40:31.310
James,
can you hear me?

40:44.896 --> 40:47.620
<i>In the wilds
of southeast Alaska,</i>

40:49.862 --> 40:51.586
<i>even the commute
to work...</i>

40:51.586 --> 40:53.793
Whoa, whoa, whoa. [bleep].

40:55.137 --> 40:56.517
<i>...is an adventure.</i>

40:56.517 --> 40:59.137
That's cold,
that wave just got me.

40:59.137 --> 41:00.620
I needed a bath.

41:05.827 --> 41:07.551
- You, all right.
- Yeah.

41:08.413 --> 41:10.000
Oh, yeah.

41:11.862 --> 41:14.448
Who the [bleep] does
this stupid [bleep] man.

41:16.862 --> 41:18.310
A good moment.

41:30.517 --> 41:31.931
[bleep] I don't
understand what's happening.

41:31.931 --> 41:33.551
Are you stuck right now?

41:35.862 --> 41:38.862
<i>James, can you hear me?</i>

41:38.862 --> 41:42.758
<i>James Hamm
is at the bottom
of Nugget Creek...</i>

41:43.551 --> 41:44.965
James.

41:44.965 --> 41:46.551
<i>...and not responding.</i>

41:46.551 --> 41:48.103
He's still in there.

41:50.620 --> 41:52.965
That was really close.

41:52.965 --> 41:55.000
I got a rock stuck
on the nozzle.

41:58.448 --> 42:02.206
So, the nose of an Asteroid
Boulder fell in the hole

42:02.206 --> 42:06.310
and it pinched the nozzle
against the bottom.

42:06.310 --> 42:08.758
Copy that, so
you got to try to yank it out

42:08.758 --> 42:11.379
from underneath
a gigantic boulder.

42:11.379 --> 42:14.620
I just need
to pull this boulder out
with a sling.

42:19.137 --> 42:21.620
<i>James narrowly
missed being crushed</i>

42:21.620 --> 42:24.758
<i>by a falling
1,000 pound boulder,</i>

42:24.758 --> 42:28.793
<i>but it has trapped his suction
hose at the bottom
of the dive hole.</i>

42:31.034 --> 42:35.275
<i>He must lasso a choker around
the boulder to winch it clear,</i>

42:37.310 --> 42:41.000
<i>before he can get back
to diving for bedrock gold.</i>

42:52.655 --> 42:55.172
Thankfully, we're not
in a rescue mission right now.

42:55.172 --> 42:57.000
We're not
set up for that.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.586
If it was his leg, I'd have
to go down there
and just hold my breath.

43:07.172 --> 43:09.517
See if I don't
pull it out.

43:10.517 --> 43:11.896
What do you need downstream?

43:11.896 --> 43:13.379
- Downstream.
- Downstream.

43:15.137 --> 43:17.689
Would you like him
to stay low or high.
Low or high?

43:17.689 --> 43:19.068
Try to keep it up high.

43:22.310 --> 43:25.448
Don't get caught
in that cable,
stay away from that cable.

43:25.448 --> 43:27.137
That [bleep] is heavy.

43:28.379 --> 43:30.655
Why don't you have
a seat, take a break.

43:30.655 --> 43:33.068
I could talk water.

43:33.068 --> 43:34.827
Let's get some oxygen
in you man.

43:34.827 --> 43:40.827
Ones we got a nice
haul there, that's starting
to get a little calm out here.

43:40.827 --> 43:44.000
Catch your
breath, catch your breath,
catch your breath.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.862
<i>Dive hose free,</i>

43:54.862 --> 43:59.103
<i>James pushes on
for the nuggets the old
timers couldn't reach.</i>

43:59.103 --> 44:01.344
You ready
for that basket or what man.

44:01.344 --> 44:03.241
Yeah, we might
as well put on a basket.

44:03.241 --> 44:06.448
Boy, that sucker
is sucking it.

44:07.965 --> 44:09.793
Got good suction
power, do you? Awesome.

44:09.793 --> 44:11.655
Yeah,

44:11.655 --> 44:14.137
Hopefully I can damage
the hole,

44:14.137 --> 44:17.310
so I can see what I'm doing,
below the water down.

44:18.827 --> 44:22.517
Ah, I feel confident
about digging here,

44:25.172 --> 44:27.862
but I'd...
I'd say so far,

44:27.862 --> 44:29.758
I made a pretty good haul.

44:29.758 --> 44:33.448
I've already opened up
probably a six-foot by
five-foot hole,

44:34.862 --> 44:37.000
there's a lot of progress
going on here.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.206
<i>Copy that,
I understand.</i>

44:39.206 --> 44:42.448
Hey, fill this basket up
and let's call it a day.

44:42.448 --> 44:44.206
All right,
sounds good.

44:48.586 --> 44:51.103
Yeah.

44:51.103 --> 44:52.724
Whoa.

44:54.827 --> 44:56.862
Good job man,
how are you feeling?

44:56.862 --> 44:58.551
A little dredge drunk?

44:58.551 --> 45:01.655
Yeah, I bet.
That was tough.

45:01.655 --> 45:04.068
But guess what,
started to get
easier towards...

45:04.068 --> 45:05.896
- Did it?
- ...towards the end
of the day.

45:06.793 --> 45:09.034
I managed to get somewhere,

45:09.034 --> 45:14.241
we got a hole
and it's probably be
about six-foot.

45:14.241 --> 45:17.068
Every scenario about
what... what a dredger does,

45:17.068 --> 45:19.137
especially in extreme
places like this.

45:20.758 --> 45:22.620
It's very, very dangerous,

45:22.620 --> 45:26.517
it's like the gold gods
who dug a creek
don't want us to get the gold,

45:26.517 --> 45:29.137
they're making us work for it.

45:29.137 --> 45:32.379
It's going to take some
getting used to here.

45:32.379 --> 45:36.620
<i>Now it's time
to do what we do,
find some real gold.</i>

45:47.379 --> 45:48.517
How's it going?

45:48.517 --> 45:50.827
I'm standing up
on some big rocks right here.

45:50.827 --> 45:52.965
Yeah, once we get the
winches and it's gonna be,

45:52.965 --> 45:54.827
it's gonna be game on.

45:55.827 --> 45:57.586
<i>Up at
Kayla's dive site...</i>

45:57.586 --> 45:59.344
Well, you're killing it.

45:59.344 --> 46:02.137
<i>...she's three hours
into her dive,</i>

46:02.137 --> 46:07.000
<i>but unlike Dustin, she hasn't
yet installed a winch system,</i>

46:07.000 --> 46:11.896
<i>so it makes slow progress
to bedrock gold.</i>

46:11.896 --> 46:15.827
Problem I'm running
into is all the rocks
just kind of locked in,

46:15.827 --> 46:19.068
and until I can pull
some of the bigger ones
out to unlock everything,

46:19.068 --> 46:20.206
it's hard to go down.

46:20.206 --> 46:22.827
It's getting frustrating,
it's getting to the point

46:22.827 --> 46:24.827
where I'm limited
in what I can do.

46:24.827 --> 46:27.068
How deep
do you think you are?

46:27.068 --> 46:29.620
You can tell
the difference in depth,

46:29.620 --> 46:32.689
I'm standing here
and I'm standing...

46:32.689 --> 46:34.103
Yeah.

46:34.103 --> 46:36.689
And this is
a shallow spot, it gets
deeper over there.

46:36.689 --> 46:39.137
I can't wait to see
what's under those big rocks.

46:39.137 --> 46:41.586
<i>In a race
to get a diver in the water,</i>

46:42.862 --> 46:46.586
<i>Kayla skipped a critical stage
of setup.</i>

46:46.586 --> 46:49.827
There are some big
rocks that I can't get out
until we get a winch.

46:49.827 --> 46:52.965
<i>They will need
to install the heavy lift gear</i>

46:52.965 --> 46:56.000
<i>before their next dive
to get any deeper.</i>

47:05.620 --> 47:07.103
[bleep] tone
of pyrite.

47:08.172 --> 47:09.689
Throw that iron.

47:09.689 --> 47:12.241
Tons and tons
of pyrite.

47:12.241 --> 47:14.172
Now, we'd be rich
if we were mining pyrite.

47:14.172 --> 47:15.310
I know, right?

47:18.068 --> 47:19.448
We didn't see
any gold today,

47:19.448 --> 47:23.103
but we're still in the process
of opening up an area.

47:23.103 --> 47:27.034
I wasn't quite expecting
to encounter large boulders
this soon into our dig.

47:27.034 --> 47:28.206
We're going to have
to figure out

47:28.206 --> 47:29.482
how we're going to get
them moved

47:29.482 --> 47:31.896
so that we can get down
to bedrock.

47:31.896 --> 47:34.758
We're ready to see
what we came here for,
and that's to see gold.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.310
<i>On the next</i>
Gold Rush: White Water.

47:45.931 --> 47:49.620
Airboats rule!

47:51.241 --> 47:53.758
Holy [bleep],
the battle's on, man,

47:53.758 --> 47:55.344
it's always been on.

47:55.344 --> 47:56.896
I'm getting
my ass kicked.

47:56.896 --> 47:59.034
It's a war, man.

47:59.034 --> 48:01.655
Look there, buddy,
I knew there was gold here.

48:01.655 --> 48:03.896
We're gonna get more gold
than we ever thought,

48:03.896 --> 48:05.551
and this is gonna be amazing.
