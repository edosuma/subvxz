09:02.366 --> 09:05.201
The time travel mostly.

09:05.269 --> 09:07.503
Also the space travel.

09:07.571 --> 09:09.005
Anything else?

09:09.073 --> 09:11.775
How many clipboards you got?

09:11.842 --> 09:13.142
Raise the klaxon.

09:13.209 --> 09:16.011
Me lorry's plunging it
into the Thames, methinks.

09:16.079 --> 09:18.513
[Laughter]
Hey, do you mind if I practice

09:18.581 --> 09:19.882
my American accent?

09:19.949 --> 09:22.151
- I have an audition.
- Of course.

09:22.218 --> 09:24.186
You really are an <i>Inspector Spacetime</i> fan.

09:24.253 --> 09:26.221
Ever since I was little.

09:26.289 --> 09:27.729
What is it you like about the show?

09:27.791 --> 09:31.859
I think the show's philosophy
poses some really interesting...

09:31.927 --> 09:33.194
Bow before Thoraxis.
Bow before Thoraxis.

09:33.261 --> 09:36.297
Questions about the nature--
I'm so sorry.

09:36.364 --> 09:39.366
- Bow before Thoraxis.
- This is my ringtone.

09:39.434 --> 09:41.569
Bow before Thoraxis.

09:41.636 --> 09:42.836
Okay, seriously, what was it?

09:42.871 --> 09:45.305
You wear glasses?
You have a back brace?

09:45.372 --> 09:46.707
Say it.
I don't care.

09:46.774 --> 09:48.909
- And I asked myself...
- Excuse me. Sorry.

09:48.976 --> 09:52.345
What does space smell like?

09:52.413 --> 09:55.481
- You see, the thing of it--
- Oh, hey, there you guys are.

09:55.549 --> 09:58.151
Oh, this is so nice, just three friends,

09:58.219 --> 10:00.553
friending around
all unthreatened-like.

10:00.621 --> 10:02.287
Terribly sorry.
This is slightly embarrassing.

10:02.355 --> 10:03.488
I seem to have forgotten your name.

10:03.556 --> 10:04.556
It's Troy!

10:04.624 --> 10:05.991
You know it's Troy!

10:06.059 --> 10:08.194
Okay, it's the first part
of <i>Troy and Abed.</i>

10:08.261 --> 10:09.795
<i>Toby and Abed in the Morning?</i>

10:09.863 --> 10:11.263
That's ridiculous.

10:11.331 --> 10:13.365
I'm not psycho!

10:13.433 --> 10:15.901
Okay.

10:15.969 --> 10:17.468
Where was I?
Oh, yes--

10:17.536 --> 10:18.469
Troy's been acting weird lately.

10:18.537 --> 10:19.637
The same thing happened

10:19.705 --> 10:21.005
with my constable when he got a wife.

10:21.073 --> 10:22.640
Which means of course
I now have one spare ticket

10:22.708 --> 10:23.842
to the 50th anniversary
<i>Inspector Spacetime</i> convention

10:23.909 --> 10:25.343
- in London.
- Demiceninspecticon?

10:25.410 --> 10:26.930
But it's so soon, and London's too far.

10:26.946 --> 10:28.613
In england, Cadbury creme eggs
are sold year-round.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.001
I thought that was just a legend.

10:30.015 --> 10:31.249
Past life as an alien...

10:31.316 --> 10:36.153
Just a minute.

10:36.221 --> 10:37.687
Just a second.

10:37.756 --> 10:39.857
I've got your hair dryer,
Mrs. Winger.

10:39.924 --> 10:42.325
Oh, thank you, Randy,
but it's not for me.

10:42.393 --> 10:43.560
It's for my husband.

10:43.628 --> 10:45.095
He really needs the diffuser
for his hair.

10:45.163 --> 10:47.364
It sounds shallow, but he's a lawyer.

10:47.431 --> 10:49.465
Actually, having dual careers

10:49.532 --> 10:51.400
has put a lot of stress on our marriage.

10:51.468 --> 10:52.468
Hence the separate rooms.

10:52.502 --> 10:53.702
But I think this trip

10:53.771 --> 10:55.704
is really gonna change all that.

10:55.773 --> 10:57.273
My husband will finally see me

10:57.340 --> 11:00.042
not as a world-famous
police detective,

11:00.110 --> 11:02.145
but as a woman.

11:02.212 --> 11:04.046
Your husband's a lucky man.

11:04.114 --> 11:06.347
That he is.

11:06.415 --> 11:08.917
[Coughs]

11:08.985 --> 11:10.786
Mm.

11:10.853 --> 11:14.756
Tastes of bog.

11:14.824 --> 11:17.525
You see?
It's funny because it's clear.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.526
[Chuckles]

11:18.594 --> 11:19.560
Actually I would like

11:19.628 --> 11:21.496
to say something.

11:21.563 --> 11:24.865
I am friends with a couple of
huge <i>Inspector Spacetime</i> fans,

11:24.933 --> 11:26.534
and I think what they like
about the show

11:26.568 --> 11:28.336
is that it's smart, complicated,

11:28.404 --> 11:30.371
and doesn't talk down to its audience.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.941
So, if you'd like to make
a really good American version,

11:34.009 --> 11:35.276
you should stay true to that.

11:35.344 --> 11:39.112
Hey, instead of this constable,

11:39.180 --> 11:42.449
what about a blonde with
long legs and a tennis racket?

11:42.517 --> 11:44.851
Yes.

11:44.919 --> 11:47.120
Please.
For me.

11:47.188 --> 11:48.922
Bow before...

11:48.989 --> 11:52.225
Normally we don't concern
ourselves with adultery,

11:52.293 --> 11:54.226
'cause then hotels wouldn't exist.

11:54.294 --> 11:56.562
But everyone here thinks you're so nice.

11:56.630 --> 11:58.597
So I had to bring you down here.

11:58.665 --> 12:01.334
I don't believe it.
He told me he was leaving.

12:01.401 --> 12:04.069
Say your catchphrase.

12:04.137 --> 12:08.941
I'd rather not.

12:09.008 --> 12:10.742
What the hell is going on here?

12:10.810 --> 12:13.010
Suddenly our marriage
isn't worth repairing?

12:13.078 --> 12:14.646
What?

12:14.714 --> 12:17.915
- Whoo!
- Wait, Nigel is married?

12:17.983 --> 12:20.117
That is so Thoraxis.

12:22.020 --> 12:25.756
And your American accent
isn't at all convincing.

12:25.824 --> 12:28.925
We come all this way,
and you just leave me alone

12:28.960 --> 12:31.495
without so much as sending
a text message?

12:31.563 --> 12:32.763
I am sick of it, Jeff...

12:32.831 --> 12:35.699
Nigel Winger.

12:35.767 --> 12:37.434
Can I get two more of these, please?

12:37.502 --> 12:38.435
Enough!

12:38.503 --> 12:41.471
This day has turned crazy.

12:41.538 --> 12:42.672
I'm gonna go upstairs,

12:42.740 --> 12:45.040
towel off, and pray to God

12:45.141 --> 12:46.776
that I wake up in the middle of a final

12:46.844 --> 12:49.579
for a class I didn't know
I was enrolled in.

12:51.014 --> 12:53.716
[Scoffs]

12:56.987 --> 12:58.953
Shoo.

13:01.791 --> 13:04.158
Oh, honey.

13:04.226 --> 13:05.994
You went all psycho girlfriend
on Abed, didn't you?

13:06.095 --> 13:08.930
Yeah.
I screwed up.

13:08.964 --> 13:10.164
Classsic Troy.

13:10.232 --> 13:11.266
It's okay.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.667
It happens to the best of us.

13:12.735 --> 13:14.167
I got you a present.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.038
A quantum spanner.

13:18.106 --> 13:20.340
Yeah, it lights up

13:20.409 --> 13:22.643
or plays music or something.

13:22.711 --> 13:24.478
Britta,

13:24.546 --> 13:26.547
would you agree to be bonded to me

13:26.615 --> 13:27.736
forever in the gluon chamber

13:27.749 --> 13:29.316
for an expensive souvenir photograph?

13:29.384 --> 13:30.850
Absolutely.

13:30.918 --> 13:32.652
[Sighs]

13:32.720 --> 13:34.086
Thank you.

13:34.154 --> 13:37.624
[Silently] What?

13:37.691 --> 13:38.792
I can't wait.
We can visit

13:38.859 --> 13:40.159
the original <i>Spacetime</i> set.

13:40.227 --> 13:41.387
And I've got a spare bedroom,

13:41.395 --> 13:42.629
so you can stay as long as you like.

13:42.696 --> 13:43.963
That all sounds great.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.197
But I don't know if I could
just pick up and leave.

13:45.265 --> 13:47.132
- I have a life here.
- For now.

13:47.199 --> 13:48.199
What do you mean?

13:48.267 --> 13:49.568
Well, let's face it.

13:49.636 --> 13:51.756
Neurotypicals don't have
the same focus you or I have.

13:51.805 --> 13:53.004
They always get distracted...

13:53.072 --> 13:55.908
by marriage, kids,
competitive cooking shows.

13:55.975 --> 13:58.577
- Like your best friend David.
- That's right.

13:58.645 --> 13:59.778
Who was planning on coming here

13:59.846 --> 14:01.407
even though you were trapped in Nigeria?

14:01.447 --> 14:02.808
Yeah, but I wouldn't say trapped.

14:02.848 --> 14:03.781
And you went to me
and not to your best friend

14:03.849 --> 14:05.015
and constable for help?

14:05.083 --> 14:06.551
Well, his wife
probably deleted the email.

14:06.618 --> 14:07.618
She's a total...
Both: Minerva.

14:07.686 --> 14:09.520
Right.

14:09.588 --> 14:11.155
And you're dressed
as the third Inspector,

14:11.222 --> 14:12.657
who was famous for trying
to strangle the actor

14:12.724 --> 14:13.758
who played Constable Dudley,
because they were

14:13.826 --> 14:15.026
both pursuing Linda McCartney.

14:15.060 --> 14:16.093
David doesn't actually exist, does he?

14:16.161 --> 14:17.361
You're mad.

14:17.429 --> 14:18.662
Nothing you've said can prove that.

14:18.729 --> 14:19.729
Except that when we met you said

14:19.797 --> 14:21.197
- his name was Andrew.
- Bollocks.

14:21.265 --> 14:25.769
- Yeah.
- All right. Guilty as charged.

14:25.837 --> 14:28.338
Look, I had to be sure, didn't I?

14:28.405 --> 14:30.941
When you sent me that first email

14:31.008 --> 14:32.308
in which you figured out
that Inspector Spacetime

14:32.376 --> 14:34.477
is both his own grandfather
and grandmother,

14:34.544 --> 14:36.345
I knew we were soul mates.

14:36.412 --> 14:38.080
You and I are special.

14:38.147 --> 14:39.582
Neurotypicals won't admit it,

14:39.649 --> 14:42.050
but some people are just better
than everybody else.

14:42.118 --> 14:44.052
They can't handle it,
so they always leave.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.688
Just like how the brilliant Inspector

14:45.755 --> 14:46.956
has constant adventures,

14:47.023 --> 14:49.024
while his constables
always eventually return

14:49.092 --> 14:51.292
to their dull, ordinary earth lives.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.394
But maybe there's a reason

14:53.462 --> 14:55.830
the Inspector always chooses
a human companion.

14:55.898 --> 14:57.499
He's an alien, but his human friends

14:57.566 --> 14:59.100
keep him grounded
and invested in the world,

14:59.167 --> 15:00.869
like with me and Troy.

15:00.936 --> 15:02.203
If I could winger you for a second.

15:02.270 --> 15:03.771
Sure. I don't know
what that means, but...

15:03.839 --> 15:07.508
Maybe all relationships are
made up of logical inspectors

15:07.575 --> 15:09.810
and emotional constables,
and we need both

15:09.878 --> 15:12.880
to make space and time a better place.

15:12.947 --> 15:15.382
Maybe you're right.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.286
Wait, wait.
Toby, Toby, Toby, no.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.688
Wait just a second.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.458
[Chuckles] Just playing a game.

15:26.527 --> 15:28.995
[Emits high-pitched whine]

15:35.420 --> 15:36.553
You have to let me out.

15:36.621 --> 15:39.255
No, not until
Stockholm syndrome sets in.

15:39.323 --> 15:41.363
How long do you think
that'll be, a couple of hours?

15:41.425 --> 15:43.426
Would you love me if I got you a churro?

15:45.095 --> 15:47.163
[Knock at door]
Annie.

15:47.231 --> 15:50.166
Annie, I...

15:58.774 --> 16:00.454
I'm not sure how much air
there is in here!

16:00.510 --> 16:02.544
And still you talk.

16:02.611 --> 16:03.845
Troy will find me.

16:03.913 --> 16:08.383
- Who?
- You know who Troy is.

16:08.451 --> 16:13.054
Yeah.
Troy will find me.

16:15.690 --> 16:17.425
Everything okay?

16:17.492 --> 16:18.992
Everything's fine.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.295
What is a gluon anyway?

16:21.363 --> 16:23.664
Can we stop talking about Abed?

16:23.731 --> 16:27.567
I'm sorry.
I can't.

16:27.634 --> 16:28.634
It doesn't feel right.

16:28.702 --> 16:31.504
It's okay.
I understand.

16:31.572 --> 16:32.939
Go to him.

16:33.006 --> 16:35.108
- Are you sure?
- I've told you before.

16:35.176 --> 16:38.445
I don't care about <i>Inspector Spacetime.</i>

16:44.016 --> 16:46.952
[Bells tolling the hour]

16:48.821 --> 16:51.090
Toby.

16:51.157 --> 16:52.391
Where's Abed?

16:52.459 --> 16:54.226
He's packing.

16:54.294 --> 16:56.462
He said you have a girlfriend
and don't need him anymore.

16:56.529 --> 16:58.162
He's coming with me to England.

16:58.230 --> 17:00.998
- You're lying.
- How would you know?

17:01.066 --> 17:02.467
Because Abed's my friend,

17:02.534 --> 17:04.135
and he would have told me.

17:04.203 --> 17:07.204
And he would have explained it
to me in very clear terms,

17:07.271 --> 17:10.040
because I get confused sometimes.

17:10.108 --> 17:11.275
He's in there, isn't he?

17:11.343 --> 17:12.710
[Chuckles] No.

17:12.777 --> 17:14.544
- Hey, Troy.
- Hey, Abed.

17:14.612 --> 17:17.247
Toby, have you ever been in a fight?

17:17.315 --> 17:19.182
Because I have.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.950
Oh, my God.
He can make a fist.

17:21.018 --> 17:22.819
That would hurt harder than a slap.

17:22.886 --> 17:24.454
He's in that one.

17:24.521 --> 17:28.325
I knew that.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.595
You okay?

17:32.662 --> 17:35.063
I am.
You know, for the first time

17:35.132 --> 17:37.052
in my long history
of being locked inside things,

17:37.066 --> 17:39.135
I knew someone would come.

17:42.772 --> 17:44.373
Still want to take the gluon photo?

17:44.441 --> 17:46.974
- What do you think?
- Yes.

17:47.042 --> 17:48.976
- Yes.
- Cool.

17:54.016 --> 17:57.051
Well, I just went upstairs
and saw your room.

17:57.119 --> 18:00.988
Saw the two robes, the two coffee cups,

18:01.056 --> 18:02.356
one with lipstick, one without.

18:02.423 --> 18:05.792
And I saw actual hair
that looked a lot like mine

18:05.860 --> 18:06.893
on my side of the sink,

18:06.961 --> 18:08.462
so I have some questions.

18:08.530 --> 18:10.464
- Oh, God.
- First one,

18:10.532 --> 18:12.399
is that actually my hair, and, if so,

18:12.467 --> 18:13.733
did it fall out naturally?

18:13.801 --> 18:15.869
Because if it did,
you need to tell me right now,

18:15.936 --> 18:17.037
'cause I have to call science.

18:17.104 --> 18:19.805
Also, what the hell is going on?

18:19.873 --> 18:22.808
All right,
I may have been play-acting

18:22.876 --> 18:24.243
that we were married, and then the staff

18:24.311 --> 18:27.380
thought you were cheating,
and I had to save face.

18:27.447 --> 18:28.747
Do I have to worry about this?

18:28.815 --> 18:31.517
No, I was just daydreaming.

18:31.585 --> 18:34.519
I mean, I've married you
at least a half a dozen times.

18:34.587 --> 18:37.322
And Troy.
And Zac Efron.

18:37.390 --> 18:38.557
Mostly Zac Efron.

18:38.624 --> 18:41.159
Does Zac get a drink thrown in his face?

18:42.728 --> 18:43.928
[Laughter]

18:43.996 --> 18:45.863
I don't know.
I guess I was a little hurt

18:45.931 --> 18:47.432
that you ditched me.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.867
I mean, we are friends, right?

18:49.935 --> 18:53.170
Would it have been that painful
to hang out together?

18:53.238 --> 18:57.774
Well, I can tell you one thing
your fantasy got wrong.

18:57.842 --> 18:59.843
If we were married, you wouldn't find me

18:59.911 --> 19:03.214
flirting with another woman
in a hotel bar.

19:03.281 --> 19:06.749
But there are a lot of things
that you think are fun

19:06.817 --> 19:08.585
that I wouldn't want to do
because I'm...

19:08.652 --> 19:10.553
- Older?
- Not lame.

19:10.621 --> 19:14.123
Do you want to hang out now?

19:14.191 --> 19:17.594
Can I buy you a drink?
What do you want?

19:17.661 --> 19:19.128
An appletini.

19:19.196 --> 19:22.297
Oh, God, don't make me order that.

19:22.365 --> 19:25.667
- Please?
- Please?

19:30.873 --> 19:32.441
[Giggles] Appletini.

19:32.508 --> 19:34.943
That is so great.

19:35.010 --> 19:37.379
And I have a surprise for you guys.

19:37.447 --> 19:39.046
Pow!

19:39.114 --> 19:41.282
- Really pushing me here.
- He's back.

19:41.350 --> 19:43.384
Do you mind if we crash this party?

19:43.452 --> 19:45.386
That we already crashed.

19:45.454 --> 19:47.221
Pierce, Shirley,
I'm glad you guys made it.

19:47.289 --> 19:48.729
It was rude of me not to invite you.

19:48.790 --> 19:51.058
- I'm sorry.
- Just remember, Abed,

19:51.126 --> 19:52.393
I did my best.

19:52.461 --> 19:54.861
We both did.

19:54.928 --> 19:56.095
You're welcome.

19:56.163 --> 19:57.564
So I guess we're taking off.

19:57.632 --> 20:00.300
Actually, I'd like to stay
for a little while.

20:00.368 --> 20:01.735
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:01.802 --> 20:03.303
You don't have to do that for me.

20:03.371 --> 20:06.172
Well, who says it's just for you?

20:06.240 --> 20:07.407
Guys, get your phones ready,

20:07.475 --> 20:09.743
because you are only
gonna see this once.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.982
[All gasping]

20:17.049 --> 20:20.185
Bow before Thoraxis.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.492
See, this is why I don't hang
with you folks on the weekends.

20:36.325 --> 20:40.294
Here we are, the 1960s,

20:40.362 --> 20:43.597
the greatest, grooviest period
in the entire history

20:43.665 --> 20:47.100
of the entire universe.

20:47.169 --> 20:49.870
I'm lucky.
I get to visit places like this

20:49.937 --> 20:54.007
because I can travel
through time and space,

20:54.075 --> 20:56.476
but not both at once.

20:56.544 --> 20:59.312
Do you know why that is, Ensign?

20:59.380 --> 21:01.981
Because, Inspector Spacetime,

21:02.049 --> 21:06.118
our minds would be blown
with the space/time confusion.

21:06.187 --> 21:07.787
That's right.

21:07.854 --> 21:11.356
And now I must sleep
with the sexiest woman here,

21:11.424 --> 21:13.225
who is also my grandmother,

21:13.293 --> 21:15.927
or I will cease to exist.

21:15.995 --> 21:17.762
How do you know
I'm not your grandmother?

21:17.830 --> 21:19.764
There's only one way to find out.

21:21.934 --> 21:24.303
I hate you.

21:24.535 --> 21:30.731
