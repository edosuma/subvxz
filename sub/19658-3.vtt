WEBVTT

00:00.794 --> 00:03.621
Look, duct tape is pretty
much a miracle creation

00:03.705 --> 00:05.928
that right now is holding
this ship together.

00:06.066 --> 00:09.154
But that isn't one of its uses.

00:09.279 --> 00:10.878
Quill, rocket informed me

00:10.978 --> 00:13.307
this binding ribbon
was excellent body armor.

00:13.521 --> 00:15.209
Uh, of course he did, Drax.

00:15.334 --> 00:16.889
Did he also happen to mention

00:16.995 --> 00:19.139
how to get that
armor off your body?

00:19.235 --> 00:21.135
How would that be a problem?

00:23.982 --> 00:25.065
Hmm.

00:25.130 --> 00:27.271
<i>Rocket? Is everything
all right?</i>

00:27.381 --> 00:29.514
What? No. No, no.
Everything's swell.

00:29.623 --> 00:32.185
So, let's skip
the formalities, Broker

00:32.284 --> 00:35.506
word on the street is, you've been
getting into the high-risk market.

00:35.597 --> 00:38.607
<i>I could, in theory, Broker
a deal for the cosmic seed,</i>

00:38.685 --> 00:41.443
<i>assuming that's
why you contacted me.</i>

00:41.553 --> 00:43.607
Cosmic seed? Oh...

00:43.740 --> 00:45.396
That's so last cycle.

00:45.450 --> 00:47.419
I got something better.

00:47.592 --> 00:49.748
Found it inside
Thanos' Asteroid.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.420
<i>Yes! Oh, that will do.</i>

00:52.498 --> 00:55.388
<i>I'll come by your ship.
What's your dock number?</i>

00:55.439 --> 00:57.971
Ain't the kind of deal I want 
to share with my partners.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.920
How about I meet you
at Starlin's?

01:02.167 --> 01:03.267
Whoa!

01:03.350 --> 01:05.364
This is not body armor.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.490
It is a painfully
effective adhesive.

01:07.623 --> 01:09.568
I demand an apology.

01:09.747 --> 01:14.006
You should apologize to me for
wasting the last of my duct tape!

01:14.646 --> 01:16.803
That stuff don't grow
on trees, you know.

01:16.935 --> 01:18.725
Now leave me alone.

01:26.997 --> 01:28.157
I will not leave your side

01:28.213 --> 01:30.354
until I receive
an honorable apology.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.524
I have made amends by
conserving your supply

01:32.642 --> 01:34.942
until you find
a true duct tape tree.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.315
Now, is there something
you wish to say to me?

01:38.589 --> 01:41.175
Yeah. Take a hike!
I'm meetin' somebody.

01:41.323 --> 01:44.495
Uh, so's I can buy parts
to fix our ship.

01:44.745 --> 01:45.875
Yeah, that's it.

01:46.050 --> 01:47.745
Drax the destroyer.

01:47.837 --> 01:50.018
Where ya been
hidin' yourself, buddy?

01:50.151 --> 01:53.214
Greetings, j'que. Drax the
destroyer does not hide.

01:53.365 --> 01:55.339
I have been guarding
the galaxy with my friends.

01:55.476 --> 01:56.476
Yah!

01:58.026 --> 01:59.235
Okay.

01:59.425 --> 02:03.643
Hey, how about a whirl on the
f'saki table for old times, huh?

02:04.760 --> 02:06.557
Drax the destroyer will play.

02:06.675 --> 02:09.455
And win, as I win at all things.

02:09.555 --> 02:13.362
Alas, I do not possess any units
to purchase a f'saki to race.

02:13.494 --> 02:15.307
Fine. One game.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.464
Then you gotta leave

02:16.527 --> 02:18.567
so's I can conduct my business.

02:18.785 --> 02:21.685
I accept your apology.
It ain't an apology!

02:21.725 --> 02:26.503
It's insurance that
nothing's gonna go wrong.

02:32.544 --> 02:34.844
Hey! What happened here?

02:36.105 --> 02:38.940
Can't remember? Too bad.

02:39.229 --> 02:40.875
You two ain't goin' nowhere

02:40.964 --> 02:42.885
till these damages are paid for.

02:43.018 --> 02:44.893
I do not remember
causing these damages,

02:44.945 --> 02:46.799
so I will not accept
payment for them.

02:46.932 --> 02:49.285
Where's my pocket
dimension storage vial?

02:49.342 --> 02:51.182
If you deadbeats won't pay,

02:51.325 --> 02:54.689
then you're gonna be
part of the damage.

I will fend off these F'sakis
with my... where is my ax?

03:16.329 --> 03:19.052
Well, great!
Our weapons are gone, too?

03:19.185 --> 03:21.310
You know, whatever happened,
I blame you.

03:21.458 --> 03:24.208
I cannot accept blame
for something I do not recall.

03:24.349 --> 03:26.485
Then let me refresh
your memories.

03:26.669 --> 03:28.443
You two and your other friend

03:28.521 --> 03:30.857
destroyed my establishment!

03:31.909 --> 03:34.709
What other friend?
We don't have friends.

03:34.795 --> 03:37.325
Not true, rocket.
We have many friends.

03:38.904 --> 03:40.693
Quill. Groot. Gamora.

03:40.868 --> 03:41.974
Aah!

03:42.399 --> 03:44.208
What is wrong with...

03:44.888 --> 03:46.193
Ugh!

03:46.415 --> 03:47.688
Yondu.

03:47.813 --> 03:49.685
I do not consider
yondu a friend.

03:49.845 --> 03:51.075
Neither do I.

03:51.228 --> 03:54.111
But that's gotta be who
J'que was talking about.

03:54.252 --> 03:56.463
Yondu must have slipped
a knockout arrow on us.

03:56.572 --> 03:58.055
And stole my vial.

03:58.142 --> 04:00.916
And we have no
Krutackin' way of finding it!

04:03.205 --> 04:04.393
Or maybe we do.

04:04.508 --> 04:05.838
Follow that arrow!

04:06.400 --> 04:09.079
What is so important about
this vial yondu has taken?

04:09.267 --> 04:11.335
Were you not on a mission
to get repair parts?

04:11.416 --> 04:14.299
Uh, the parts
are in the vial, obviously.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.416
We need them!

04:24.403 --> 04:26.163
Oh. Sorry.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.708
When did you have time to
obtain the spare parts?

04:32.785 --> 04:35.064
Stop asking
Krutackin' questions!

04:37.946 --> 04:40.046
Perhaps we should enlist
the help of our allies.

04:40.220 --> 04:43.025
No way! 'Cause we don't
want 'em to know we...

04:43.235 --> 04:45.439
I mean, you
lost our parts, do we?

04:45.557 --> 04:48.572
But surely our absence
would cause greater concern.

04:50.897 --> 04:54.220
Hey, Gamora, you notice how
peaceful it's been around the ship?

04:54.678 --> 04:56.298
Now that you mention it.

04:56.478 --> 04:58.445
I am Groot.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.345
Eh. Probably
just a coincidence.

05:05.153 --> 05:07.253
Ah, there you are, old friend.

05:07.470 --> 05:10.564
Was wondering where
you flew off to.

05:10.797 --> 05:13.884
Yo, yondu, give us back
that vial you stole.

05:14.244 --> 05:16.495
I didn't steal
nothin' from you, varmint.

05:16.603 --> 05:19.713
Now, I won that vial, and
your weapons, fair and square

05:19.977 --> 05:21.455
in that F'saki race.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.105
Which wasn't rigged at all.

05:24.322 --> 05:27.416
- Oh, yeah? Tell it to the F'saki!
- Huh? Heh...

05:27.479 --> 05:30.056
They sure like them treats you
got stashed in your pocket.

05:30.175 --> 05:32.115
Eh, mmm...

05:32.204 --> 05:33.969
Uh, pure coincidence.

05:34.088 --> 05:37.181
You made us unconscious,
and destroyed the tavern.

05:37.417 --> 05:39.603
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

05:39.689 --> 05:40.812
Who knows?

05:40.860 --> 05:42.590
I ain't no detective.

05:42.809 --> 05:45.939
I know 412 ways
to use this weapon.

05:46.195 --> 05:47.525
Uh, wait, wait, wait!

05:47.758 --> 05:49.390
I'd love to give you
back the vial,

05:49.523 --> 05:51.726
but the thing is,
I don't have it.

05:51.859 --> 05:54.250
I ran into the Broker.
He had units, and...

05:54.406 --> 05:55.601
What was I supposed to do?

05:55.734 --> 05:57.812
You sold it? To the Broker?

05:57.945 --> 06:00.745
Why? Somethin'
important in it?

06:01.021 --> 06:02.842
It contains parts
to fix our ship.

06:02.915 --> 06:04.415
Well, flarg.

06:04.523 --> 06:06.695
We got a whole hangar
full of ships here.

06:06.775 --> 06:08.679
I can rip off any part you need.

06:08.828 --> 06:11.344
It wasn't just parts, it was...

06:11.547 --> 06:16.031
It was the last lock of tail
fur from my sainted mother!

06:16.171 --> 06:20.164
I did not know this. There is
nothing more important than family.

06:20.429 --> 06:22.187
Except maybe our weapons.

06:22.495 --> 06:24.765
Hand 'em over, Yondu.

06:27.365 --> 06:29.135
My vial!

06:29.175 --> 06:33.005
Give it back, or I decorate
the room with your insides.

06:33.045 --> 06:35.275
Please! I don't
have it anymore.

06:35.339 --> 06:37.127
It wouldn't open, so I sold it

06:37.175 --> 06:39.630
as a blind lot
to an auction house.

06:39.914 --> 06:41.944
Do you respect rocket's mother?

06:42.055 --> 06:44.355
I'm sure that I do.

06:44.490 --> 06:47.076
Then you will tell us the
location of this auction house.

06:47.193 --> 06:48.826
It won't be easy to get into.

06:48.997 --> 06:52.279
It's a very selective crowd
with exclusive entry bands.

06:52.465 --> 06:54.677
These aren't
your kind of people.

06:54.904 --> 06:56.966
No people are my kind of people.

06:57.157 --> 06:58.591
But that won't stop us.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.064
We're pros.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.654
"Undercover" is our middle name.

07:02.904 --> 07:05.372
Incorrect.
My middle name is "The."

07:05.594 --> 07:06.594
Oy.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.899
Okay.
Don't mess this up.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.531
Fear not.
I will impress you

07:12.579 --> 07:14.507
with the false identity
skills you and Quill

07:14.555 --> 07:15.992
have been teaching me.

07:16.173 --> 07:18.657
No entry without a wrist band.

07:18.792 --> 07:20.368
I do not require a wrist band.

07:20.454 --> 07:22.525
For I am Dra...
Drackson.

07:22.884 --> 07:24.895
Drackson the flame broiler.

07:24.985 --> 07:26.025
I am catering this event.

07:26.461 --> 07:27.720
Oh, yeah?

07:27.841 --> 07:30.290
And who's he?
He is the main course.

07:31.688 --> 07:33.798
Well, let's see
if you're on the list.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.376
Drackson...

07:36.743 --> 07:38.532
Uh, here you are.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.282
We're actually on
the guest list?

07:41.407 --> 07:43.800
No. The "Terminate
on sight" list.

07:47.679 --> 07:49.194
Two against one?

07:49.710 --> 07:51.337
We got this.

07:51.562 --> 07:53.525
Then clearly,
you've never met...

07:53.788 --> 07:55.804
The blood brothers!

07:59.795 --> 08:01.351
For the honor
of rocket's mother!

08:01.414 --> 08:03.354
Aah!

08:06.755 --> 08:08.804
You cannot defeat us.

08:10.030 --> 08:12.757
For we are of one mind!

08:12.857 --> 08:14.327
Aah!

08:15.637 --> 08:18.433
You share a brain?
Hmm, makes sense.

08:18.605 --> 08:21.593
Aah! Which one's
using it right now?

08:24.007 --> 08:26.280
So you guys share everything?

08:26.501 --> 08:28.452
That's gotta be
awkward sometimes.

08:28.624 --> 08:30.296
Like right now!

08:31.382 --> 08:33.585
That was just to get
your attention.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.946
And now you're out cold!

08:38.304 --> 08:42.609
See? That's why I always
say sharing is overrated.

08:43.110 --> 08:45.171
Taking, on the other hand...

08:47.241 --> 08:48.419
keep your eyes peeled.

08:48.490 --> 08:51.335
The vial's gotta be
somewhere, ready for sale.

08:51.546 --> 08:53.815
Eye-peeling is
a barbaric practice.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.171
My people outlawed it long ago.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:05.402 --> 09:06.679
Hmm.

09:11.174 --> 09:12.608
Weird.

09:13.163 --> 09:15.405
Tell me, friend,
have you ever considered

09:15.435 --> 09:18.187
maximizing your potential
through belief?

09:18.718 --> 09:20.475
Behold, drax the destroyer!

09:20.608 --> 09:23.108
Is this not maximum enough?

09:23.272 --> 09:26.687
The believers can show you how
to move beyond the physical

09:26.820 --> 09:28.780
with the power of your mind.

09:29.006 --> 09:30.246
Believers, huh?

09:30.385 --> 09:32.866
We met one of those
crackpots on spartax.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.247
Ain't you a little far
from home out here?

09:35.355 --> 09:38.757
Our ranks expand, thanks to
the work of our patriarch.

09:38.895 --> 09:42.335
We now have eyes and ears
across the galaxy.

09:42.530 --> 09:44.535
Complete bodies
would be more useful.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.843
A golden age is coming,
my friend.

09:47.005 --> 09:49.272
We believe an item
at this very auction

09:49.366 --> 09:50.875
will Usher in that age.

09:52.288 --> 09:53.505
These are the same nutjobs

09:53.545 --> 09:55.429
who thought Quill
was the chosen one.

09:55.530 --> 09:57.804
I wouldn't take 'em
too seriously.

09:58.296 --> 09:59.999
Here, brother.

10:00.185 --> 10:02.069
This will point you to
the nearest believer ship,

10:02.116 --> 10:04.843
so you can join us
once you see the light.

10:05.125 --> 10:08.125
Thank you, but my eyesight
is already perfect.

10:12.095 --> 10:13.825
We ain't here to make friends.

10:13.913 --> 10:16.710
Those two are nuttier that
that antenna lady on spartax.

10:16.843 --> 10:18.124
You mean her?

10:20.365 --> 10:22.280
Mantis?
She'll recognize us! Hide!

10:22.421 --> 10:24.155
Oh!

10:25.811 --> 10:29.851
Hail, Mantis, celestial protege
of the universal believers.

10:30.328 --> 10:32.398
Brother Raker.
Brother Aarokine.

10:32.694 --> 10:34.163
I have located the vial.

10:34.237 --> 10:35.265
I believe it emanates

10:35.315 --> 10:38.171
the energy signature
predicted by the prophecy.

10:44.427 --> 10:45.627
Aah!

10:46.995 --> 10:49.421
The prophecy states
the item that lies within

10:49.495 --> 10:51.624
will bring about
a new golden age.

10:51.757 --> 10:53.535
Or the destruction
of the Universe.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.468
But we believe the golden age...

10:55.589 --> 10:57.889
will be the outcome.

10:58.305 --> 11:01.984
Come. We must exercise the mental
powers granted by our belief.

11:02.257 --> 11:04.199
We believe the others
at this auction

11:04.247 --> 11:06.117
will not bid on the vial.

11:10.484 --> 11:13.825
You hear that? Those wackos
could destroy the Universe!

11:14.078 --> 11:15.855
But how could
your mother's tail fur

11:15.895 --> 11:17.875
bring about the end
of the Universe?

11:18.547 --> 11:19.984
Have you met my mom?

11:20.162 --> 11:21.522
Point taken.

11:27.935 --> 11:29.835
Aah!

11:36.125 --> 11:37.898
Ugh! Truly foul.

11:37.982 --> 11:39.052
Where are we?

11:39.145 --> 11:41.453
You know how
knowhere's a big head?

11:41.562 --> 11:43.304
Well, this is the sinus cavity.

11:43.390 --> 11:44.679
They use it as a vault.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.485
The vial wasn't
in the auction house,

11:46.626 --> 11:48.625
so this is the only
other place it could be.

11:48.711 --> 11:51.453
I believe I came
to the same conclusion.

11:51.507 --> 11:52.991
Hey, that's mine!

11:53.054 --> 11:54.273
Not anymore.

11:54.372 --> 11:55.757
I received an anonymous tip

11:55.828 --> 11:57.625
that you were looking
for this vial.

11:57.832 --> 12:01.132
Yondu! I knew I needed to
obtain it before you did.

12:01.205 --> 12:05.035
I couldn't risk having the
golden age tainted by doubters.

12:05.231 --> 12:07.606
You're gonna give that back...
No.

12:07.751 --> 12:11.715
I believe I will walk through
that door, and you won't stop me.

12:11.883 --> 12:13.879
Ha! Doubt it, sister.

12:14.013 --> 12:16.413
Your small-time brain
whammy-jammies

12:16.485 --> 12:18.415
won't stop us
from taking what's ours.

12:18.567 --> 12:19.985
I might not be powerful enough

12:20.025 --> 12:22.125
to mind-control
you both alone...

12:22.989 --> 12:26.395
But together, we are.

12:26.598 --> 12:29.968
Ebony maw? You left the black
order and joined the believers?

12:30.235 --> 12:32.708
The believers
actively recruit beings

12:32.787 --> 12:34.957
with elevated mental powers.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.997
We will be the elite
when the golden age arrives.

12:38.129 --> 12:39.475
We believe they have the vial,

12:39.544 --> 12:42.559
and should be disposed of.

12:51.155 --> 12:53.958
Why does the world
keep goin' upside down?

12:59.025 --> 13:01.895
No one will find you
on this abandoned moon,

13:01.965 --> 13:03.504
so try not to struggle.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.817
Because if you struggle,
you'll sink faster.

13:07.059 --> 13:10.275
And we want this
to go nice and slow.

13:14.380 --> 13:17.150
For the record,
I still blame you.

13:24.955 --> 13:26.434
If I must meet my fate,

13:26.700 --> 13:30.059
at least it shall be with a true
and honest companion by my side.

13:30.225 --> 13:33.309
Yeah, honest. Right.

13:35.848 --> 13:38.426
Hey. What's that
doing here?

13:38.934 --> 13:42.317
Scram! Let us sink
to our doom in peace.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.184
Wait. F'saki are strong.

13:44.333 --> 13:45.536
Come, small warrior.

13:45.645 --> 13:48.286
Let us put aside
our enmity and band together.

13:50.223 --> 13:51.645
Ain't you noticed by now?

13:51.817 --> 13:54.411
Making friends
never works for us.

13:54.692 --> 13:56.545
Being annoying,
on the other hand...

13:56.692 --> 13:58.915
Take that, you little chump.

13:59.434 --> 14:01.653
- What ya gonna do?
- Ow!

14:03.266 --> 14:06.278
Thanks for the ride, chump!

14:06.908 --> 14:08.278
Thank you, noble beast.

14:08.395 --> 14:10.419
Your assistance
was helpful this day.

14:11.863 --> 14:14.700
Yeah, was. Now beat it.

14:19.114 --> 14:21.075
I am hungry.
I am fatigued.

14:21.358 --> 14:23.395
It is time we called
the others for help.

14:23.645 --> 14:24.997
Ugh!

14:25.175 --> 14:27.887
Fine. Quill, come in.

14:28.113 --> 14:29.637
You there, Humie?

14:33.715 --> 14:36.333
Ugh! Must have got
quicksand in there.

14:36.598 --> 14:39.090
I can fix it.
Won't take long.

14:47.825 --> 14:49.583
Almost done!

14:49.678 --> 14:51.629
You have been
saying that for three days!

14:51.761 --> 14:53.261
I am starving!

15:00.959 --> 15:04.459
Aah! Why did
I get us into this?

15:04.615 --> 15:07.434
You have repeatedly asserted
that this is all my fault.

15:07.512 --> 15:09.934
That's 'cause I've been lying!

15:10.090 --> 15:12.700
You think I'm your honest
and loyal friend?

15:12.950 --> 15:14.284
News flash.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.611
I ain't.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.166
The vial don't got
anything from my mom.

15:18.305 --> 15:20.862
It's got Thanos'
Sarcophagus thing.

15:21.065 --> 15:22.666
I've been lying,
so I could sell it

15:22.768 --> 15:24.635
and pocket the units for myself.

15:24.755 --> 15:27.440
Now the believers could use
it to end the Universe,

15:27.557 --> 15:29.409
and it'll be all my fault!

15:29.659 --> 15:31.245
Some Guardian I am.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.471
Even Quill is
less useless than me.

15:33.685 --> 15:36.026
Stop.
You're making me blush.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.198
Guys! How'd you find us?

15:40.285 --> 15:42.346
The peace and quiet
was a nice change,

15:42.455 --> 15:45.487
but on the fourth day, we
actually got a little worried.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.557
Yeah. So we fixed
the ship ourselves,

15:47.682 --> 15:49.330
and followed
one of rocket's trackers.

15:49.565 --> 15:50.752
I am Groot.

15:55.362 --> 15:58.166
Deceiving me and branding
me with your visage?

15:58.307 --> 16:00.995
I should have eaten your
carcass when I had the chance!

16:01.143 --> 16:04.065
Go ahead.
The vial's gone.

16:04.257 --> 16:06.674
And the Universe is
probably gonna go, too.

16:06.924 --> 16:10.338
He's right. We have no idea
how to find the believers.

16:10.745 --> 16:12.424
Perhaps this will help.

16:12.783 --> 16:17.674
<i>We believe you wish to know more
about the power of the mind.</i>

16:17.868 --> 16:19.868
<i>Join the believers
on our flagship,</i>

16:20.002 --> 16:22.302
<i>currently at these coordinates.</i>

16:23.604 --> 16:25.307
Welcome, new recruits.

16:25.602 --> 16:28.791
Thanks to technology provided
to us by our Patriarch,

16:28.935 --> 16:32.987
we are able to convert mental
energy into physical energy.

16:33.165 --> 16:37.165
Our ship is literally powered
by positive thinking.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.565
This is our belief converter.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.495
Even those who lack
advanced psionic abilities

16:43.635 --> 16:46.682
can power the device simply
by stating their belief.

16:47.049 --> 16:51.323
We believe. We believe.

16:51.565 --> 16:55.495
We believe we can open the vial.

17:08.776 --> 17:10.244
Not again!

17:10.362 --> 17:12.502
This is not the object we seek!

17:12.742 --> 17:15.284
You told me I used up
the last of your duct tape!

17:15.385 --> 17:16.698
More lies!

17:16.805 --> 17:19.948
Doubters! I believe
they will be captured!

17:23.069 --> 17:25.368
By a handful of
unarmed fanatics?

17:25.525 --> 17:26.790
I doubt that.

17:26.885 --> 17:30.002
And that is why you will fall
to the power of belief.

17:30.142 --> 17:31.753
Attack!

17:37.073 --> 17:39.135
Oh, so they can do that now.

17:39.323 --> 17:41.120
That and much more.

17:41.258 --> 17:44.182
I believe your weapon
will malfunction.

17:44.370 --> 17:45.612
Aah!

17:48.142 --> 17:51.088
I believe I can combat you.

18:00.823 --> 18:03.377
I believe I can overpower you.

18:04.879 --> 18:07.209
I believe you suffer
from root rot!

18:07.295 --> 18:10.825
I am Groot!

18:12.819 --> 18:14.713
I am Groot.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.291
I believe you cannot harm me.

18:19.471 --> 18:20.924
Where is the Sarcophagus?

18:21.045 --> 18:23.885
I don't know.
I don't believe you.

18:24.097 --> 18:25.260
That's ironic.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.572
You are right to doubt him.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.151
Everything from
his mouth is a lie!

18:35.163 --> 18:37.163
What just happened?

18:37.295 --> 18:39.026
They're powered by belief!

18:39.190 --> 18:40.898
But if they don't know
what to believe...

18:40.946 --> 18:42.229
Then no more power.

18:42.354 --> 18:44.659
Which means rocket
needs to keep up the lies.

18:44.752 --> 18:47.518
Oh, yeah.
That, I can do.

18:47.682 --> 18:50.830
Yo! I gave the sarcophagus
to the Nova corps.

18:50.940 --> 18:52.375
Or maybe I didn't.

18:52.448 --> 18:53.573
But I tipped 'em off,

18:53.666 --> 18:56.620
so they'll be here
any minute. Or not.

18:56.791 --> 19:00.213
Either way, I rigged
your ship to explode.

19:00.377 --> 19:03.823
Nah, I didn't. Did I?

19:06.025 --> 19:08.135
The doubt is draining
our belief batteries.

19:08.260 --> 19:10.010
We are powerless!

19:10.360 --> 19:13.916
Hey! Remember when you said this ship
is powered by positive thinking?

19:14.050 --> 19:18.073
Yeah, you might want to
believe it back into orbit.

19:24.702 --> 19:27.166
Your pathological inability
to tell the truth

19:27.297 --> 19:28.565
actually proved useful.

19:28.651 --> 19:32.760
Hey, you can't spell "believe"
without l-i-e.

19:51.406 --> 19:54.276
Nine rolls of duct tape,
a month's supply of pellets,

19:54.375 --> 19:56.034
assorted items that go boom,

19:56.166 --> 19:58.416
but no Sarcophagus.

20:01.844 --> 20:03.307
<i>Howdy, Varmint!</i>

20:03.479 --> 20:05.018
<i>Soon as I realized
how taken you was</i>

20:05.072 --> 20:07.430
<i>with the contents
of this here vial,</i>

20:07.565 --> 20:10.155
<i>I broke into the auction
house vault and grabbed it</i>

20:10.237 --> 20:12.255
<i>before you or anyone else could.</i>

20:12.362 --> 20:15.198
<i>Wish I could see the look
on your fuzzy face.</i>

20:15.279 --> 20:16.682
<i>But I can't, 'cause I'm off</i>

20:16.791 --> 20:19.510
<i>to sell this here box
to the highest bidder.</i>

20:19.705 --> 20:21.221
<i>Have a nice day!</i>

20:22.035 --> 20:25.760
That backstabbing,
furless ravager!

20:28.075 --> 20:30.005
What did that believer
prophecy say?

20:30.120 --> 20:32.987
That the sarcophagus would
bring a new golden age?

20:33.073 --> 20:35.045
Or destroy the Universe.

20:35.198 --> 20:38.112
We need to get to yondu before
he does something stupid.

20:39.041 --> 20:41.705
Gonna be rollin'
in the units now.

20:41.846 --> 20:44.487
Time to see
what's under the hood.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.627
Rocket, I have decided
to forgive you

20:59.768 --> 21:02.674
for your deceptions, since you
undoubtedly learned a lesson.

21:02.823 --> 21:04.729
Ho-ho, I sure did, pal.

21:04.799 --> 21:07.471
Honesty is the worst policy.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.698
No, the lesson that
your lies have consequences.

21:10.982 --> 21:12.982
Yeah. Great consequences.

21:13.084 --> 21:14.987
If I wasn't such a good liar,

21:15.080 --> 21:17.370
we'd have never got off
that believer ship alive!

21:17.440 --> 21:20.245
- Hah!
- I am Groot?

21:20.465 --> 21:21.620
Holo-photos?

21:21.705 --> 21:24.151
I didn't take any holo-photos
the other night.

21:24.299 --> 21:25.870
I do not remember any of this.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.995
Ah! Too much truth! Shut it off!
