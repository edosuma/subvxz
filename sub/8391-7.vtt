WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.063
- HEY, GORDON,
NOBODY'S PHONING IT IN.

00:02.170 --> 00:03.068
- YOU ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART
OF THIS COMPANY

00:03.170 --> 00:04.478
AND WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

00:04.590 --> 00:05.614
- YOU SPEND ALL YOUR TIME AT
THIS KELSEY'S HOUSE.

00:05.720 --> 00:06.721
I MEAN, I WANTED YOU
TO MAKE A FRIEND, BUT COME ON.

00:06.830 --> 00:09.105
- WE'RE ALL JUST CRAZY
ABOUT AMBER, BY THE WAY.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.723
- YOU WERE JUST GREAT TONIGHT.

00:10.830 --> 00:12.559
- THAT PART THAT KELSEY SAID,
THAT THING ABOUT

00:12.660 --> 00:13.900
ME BEING YOUR BOYFRIEND--

00:14.010 --> 00:16.558
I DIDN'T COMPLETELY HATE
THE SOUND OF THAT.

00:16.670 --> 00:18.069
- IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE
ANOTHER BABY, JULIA,

00:18.190 --> 00:19.566
THERE HAS TO BE ROOM FOR ME.

00:19.670 --> 00:21.422
YOU CAN'T BE THE ONE MAKING
ALL THE PLANS

00:21.530 --> 00:23.225
AND I JUST CAN'T BE
THE "YES" MAN.

00:23.330 --> 00:25.423
- JASMINE, I'VE DONE SOME PRETTY
AWESOME THINGS IN MY LIFE,

00:25.540 --> 00:28.634
BUT NOTHING WOULD BE AS AWESOME
AS MARRYING YOU.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.536
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

00:30.650 --> 00:34.575
WE HAVE SOME REALLY
EXCITING NEWS.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.160
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO SIT DOWN FOR THIS.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.851
- SHOULD I TELL HIM?
- YEAH, TELL HIM.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.679
- MOMMY AND DADDY
ARE GETTING MARRIED.

00:41.800 --> 00:42.721
- ISN'T THAT EXCITING?

00:42.830 --> 00:48.348
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!

00:48.460 --> 00:50.007
- DO YOU--
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A WEDDING IS?

00:50.110 --> 00:51.111
- WHEN YOU GET MARRIED?

00:51.220 --> 00:52.699
- RIGHT.
- EXACTLY.

00:52.810 --> 00:53.458
- AND THERE'S A CAKE.

00:53.570 --> 00:54.696
- OH, MAN, THERE'S A HUGE CAKE.

00:54.810 --> 00:56.528
LIKE, A FOUR-TIER CAKE.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.971
- I LIKE CAKE.

00:58.090 --> 00:59.671
- DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

00:59.780 --> 01:02.226
- UM...

01:02.330 --> 01:04.571
CAN I GO PLAY UNTIL WE HAVE
TO LEAVE FOR SCHOOL?

01:04.680 --> 01:06.534
- SURE YOU CAN.

01:06.650 --> 01:10.950
GO AHEAD.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.059
[laughs]

01:12.170 --> 01:13.546
- WELL, THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING.

01:13.650 --> 01:15.208
- [sighs]

01:15.310 --> 01:16.754
- IT'S LIKE A TOTAL NON-EVENT.

01:16.860 --> 01:19.488
- BABE, HE'S SIX AND A BOY.

01:19.590 --> 01:22.070
WEDDINGS AREN'T HIGH
ON HIS LIST OF THRILLS.

01:26.010 --> 01:27.420
- GROUNDED?
- YEAH.

01:27.530 --> 01:29.259
YOU WENT TO A COLLEGE PARTY
ACROSS THE BAY.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.497
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE GOING
TO BE AT KELSEY'S HOUSE,

01:30.600 --> 01:31.942
SO YOU'RE GROUNDED.
- RIGHT, I GET IT.

01:32.050 --> 01:32.869
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE
THOUGH.

01:32.980 --> 01:34.186
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

01:34.300 --> 01:35.676
- COME HOME
AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK

01:35.780 --> 01:37.577
AND YOU HAVE A MISERABLE TIME
FOR THREE DAYS.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.126
- WHY WOULD I BE GROUNDED
WHEN I DID THE RIGHT THING?

01:40.230 --> 01:42.983
I MEAN, WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED
TO DO IN THAT SITUATION?

01:43.100 --> 01:45.477
WAS I NOT INCREDIBLY RESPONSIBLE
AND AWESOME?

01:45.580 --> 01:47.263
- YEAH, YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE
WHEN YOUR FRIEND GOT DRUNK

01:47.380 --> 01:48.711
AND YOU DID THE RIGHT THING
IN CALLING ME,

01:48.830 --> 01:49.899
BUT YOU LIED TO ME.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.274
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GROUNDED.

01:51.380 --> 01:52.551
HAS SHE TOLD HER MOM YET?
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:52.660 --> 01:54.651
IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS.
IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS.

01:54.760 --> 01:55.761
- AMBER, SHE WAS FISHED OUT
OF A POOL.

01:55.870 --> 01:56.723
SHE THREW UP IN A CAR.

01:56.840 --> 01:58.728
- MOM, I GET IT.
- SHE WAS REALLY DRUNK.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.626
- I'M SURE YOU'VE MADE WORSE
MISTAKES THAN THAT.

02:00.740 --> 02:02.219
- HER MOTHER NEEDS TO KNOW AND
IF SHE DOESN'T TELL HER, I WILL.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.355
- MO
MOM? Tâ€™II/IO2M?

02:03.460 --> 02:04.427
- DREW!

02:04.530 --> 02:06.418
- CAN YOU JUST LISTEN?
- COME EAT IN HERE.

02:06.540 --> 02:09.498
- CAN YOU JUST--
CAN YOU JUST LISTEN? OKAY.

02:09.610 --> 02:11.464
- SO TODAY, WE'RE GONNA DEMO.

02:11.570 --> 02:14.152
THAT'S WHERE WE TAKE THESE
BIG, HUGE HAMMERS

02:14.270 --> 02:17.091
AND WE SMASH THE WHOLE
BATHROOM TO PIECES.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.020
JUST--
[imitating explosion]

02:19.130 --> 02:21.200
IT'S AWESOME.
- THAT SOUNDS FUN.

02:21.310 --> 02:22.686
- IT IS FUN.

02:22.790 --> 02:23.825
THEN WE'LL GET STARTED
ON THE REMODEL.

02:23.930 --> 02:25.443
WE'RE GONNA ADD NEW TILE,

02:25.550 --> 02:27.518
PUT IN A BATHTUB,
MAYBE A SHOWER.

02:27.630 --> 02:28.892
CHECK OUT THESE FIXTURES
I GOT.

02:29.010 --> 02:30.386
THESE ARE AWESOME.

02:30.490 --> 02:31.866
FEEL HOW HEAW THAT IS.

02:31.970 --> 02:33.414
OH, YEAH.
- OOH.

02:33.530 --> 02:35.760
- THAT'S THE STUFF RIGHT THERE.
- FANCY.

02:35.870 --> 02:37.258
- IT IS FANCY.
YES.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.634
- HEY.
- HEY.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.776
- WE ARE ACTUALLY RUNNING AHEAD
OF SCHEDULE TODAY.

02:40.880 --> 02:44.464
WE'RE ONLY GOING TO BE FIVE
MINUTES LATE TO SCHOOL TODAY.

02:44.570 --> 02:46.390
AND YOU, YOU CAN'T BE LATE
TO THE JOB SITE.

02:46.510 --> 02:47.602
GET OUT OF HERE.
- NO, I KNOW.

02:47.710 --> 02:48.779
- DO YOU NEED THIS?
- YEP, YEP.

02:48.890 --> 02:49.982
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.089
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.235
I GOT IT COVERED.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.500
KICK THEIR CONSTRUCTION ASSES!

02:53.620 --> 02:54.370
I LOVE YOU!

02:54.480 --> 02:56.539
- LOVE YOU!
BYE!

02:56.650 --> 03:00.302
- THAT IS HOW MARRIAGE WORKS.

03:00.420 --> 03:03.059
GIVE AND TAKE.

03:03.180 --> 03:04.659
[laughs]

03:04.770 --> 03:05.930
- HEY.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.246
GOOD MORNING, MARY.

03:07.350 --> 03:10.046
- MORNING, ADAM.

03:10.150 --> 03:11.970
- GORDON.
- HEY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.877
- YEAH?

03:13.980 --> 03:15.561
- WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

03:15.670 --> 03:19.367
- LISTEN, GORDON, IF, UH...

03:19.470 --> 03:21.290
THIS IS ABOUT MY SISTER SARAH,
I'D REALLY RATHER

03:21.400 --> 03:22.469
STAY OUT OF IT, YOU KNOW?

03:22.580 --> 03:23.808
- THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH SARAH

03:23.920 --> 03:24.989
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT SHE
WORKS FOR THIS COMPANY.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.783
- OH, GOOD.

03:26.890 --> 03:28.619
WHAT'S UP?

03:28.720 --> 03:30.756
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT THE BOOKS

03:30.860 --> 03:32.714
AND THE NUMBERS
JUST DON'T ADD UP.

03:32.830 --> 03:34.058
I CAN'T MAKE IT WORK.

03:34.170 --> 03:36.058
- LOOK, GORDON,
I KNOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR

03:36.180 --> 03:37.693
A TURNAROUND HERE,
BUT I REALLY BELIEVE

03:37.800 --> 03:38.721
IN THE SPRING LINE.

03:38.830 --> 03:39.865
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO TEST

03:39.970 --> 03:41.244
THIS SHOE CLICKER THING.

03:41.350 --> 03:42.590
WE'RE ABOUT TO TEST THAT.
- LISTEN TO ME, ADAM.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.621
ADAM, ADAM, ADAM.

03:43.740 --> 03:44.764
WE'RE NEVER GONNA
MAKE IT TO SPRING.

03:44.870 --> 03:45.802
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
GORDON?

03:45.910 --> 03:48.049
- I NEED IMMEDIATE LAYOFFS,
LIKE, YESTERDAY.

03:48.150 --> 03:49.560
SIX OR SEVEN PEOPLE AT LEAST.

03:49.670 --> 03:51.774
- GORDON, JUST KEEP IT DOWN
FOR A SECOND, ALL RIGHT?

03:51.880 --> 03:53.529
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE NEED
TO LAY OFF SEVEN PEOPLE?

03:53.640 --> 03:54.777
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT
OF OUR WORKFORCE.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.269
- I KNOW THAT.
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

03:57.370 --> 03:59.531
- I'VE GOT A MEETING
IN LA. TODAY

03:59.650 --> 04:01.709
WITH A POTENTIAL INVESTOR
WHO COULD SAVE OUR ASSES,

04:01.820 --> 04:03.447
BUT IF HE DOESN'T COME THROUGH,
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT

04:03.550 --> 04:04.756
WHERE WE'RE CUTTING.

04:04.860 --> 04:06.441
- LISTEN, GORDON,
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

04:06.550 --> 04:08.541
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE

04:08.660 --> 04:10.309
IN CHOOSING WHO GETS TO KEEP
AND WHO GETS TO LOSE

04:10.420 --> 04:11.819
THEIR JOB HERE.

04:11.940 --> 04:14.204
- ADAM, YOU KNOW THIS GROUP
BETTER THAN I DO.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.073
BETTER THAN ANYONE, IN FACT.

04:17.180 --> 04:18.386
YOU'RE BETTER AT THIS THAN ME.

04:18.490 --> 04:22.392
- YEAH, AT WHAT?
FIRING PEOPLE?

04:22.500 --> 04:24.354
- JUST DO ME A FAVOR.
- YEAH?

04:24.470 --> 04:25.778
- COME UP WITH A LIST.

04:38.930 --> 04:41.398
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

04:41.520 --> 04:44.034
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

04:44.140 --> 04:46.370
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

04:46.490 --> 04:48.867
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

04:48.970 --> 04:51.382
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

04:51.490 --> 04:53.799
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

04:53.910 --> 04:55.832
AND MAY YOU STAY

04:55.950 --> 04:58.418
FOREVER YOUNG

04:58.530 --> 05:01.158
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

05:01.260 --> 05:03.433
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

05:03.540 --> 05:05.815
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

05:05.920 --> 05:08.150
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

05:08.270 --> 05:10.738
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

05:10.860 --> 05:13.090
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

05:13.200 --> 05:14.997
AND MAY YOU STAY

05:15.100 --> 05:17.921
FOREVER YOUNG

05:18.040 --> 05:19.962
MAY YOU STAY

05:20.070 --> 05:23.483
FOREVER YOUNG

05:36.950 --> 05:38.565
- WHAT'S WRONG?

05:38.680 --> 05:40.432
- HEY, OH, NOTHING.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.646

11:07.700 --> 11:08.962
IT'S A BIG PROBLEM.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.308
THEY DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF
RELATIONSHIP

11:51.670 --> 11:53.558
THE COMPANY IS NOT

WHY WOULD I MAKE UP THAT MANNY'S
KID IS BLIND?

12:31.090 --> 12:32.125
- I KNEW HE WORE GLASSES,
BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S BLIND.

12:32.230 --> 12:33.254

13:48.790 --> 13:51.406
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.579
BUT THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS.

13:53.690 --> 13:55.419
YOU KNOW, AND I DON'T EVEN WANT

13:55.520 --> 13:59.274
WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF SHE TRIED
DRIVING IN THAT CONDITION.

13:59.390 --> 14:03.247

THAT'S GONNA WORK.

14:53.680 --> 14:54.886

14:54.990 --> 14:56.127
YOU KNOW KIDS AND POWER TOOLS.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.229
PROBABLY NOT

15:08.970 --> 15:10.619
THAT'S A DISASTER.

15:33.170 --> 15:34.717
- YOU SURE?
- I'M--I'M SURE. I'M SURE.

15:34.830 --> 15:35.922
- I LOVE YOU.

15:36.030 --> 15:37.019
- I LOVE YOU.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:37.140 --> 15:38.687
KICK BUTT.

15:38.790 --> 15:42.726

15:42.830 --> 15:44.718
- LOOK AT IT, JENSEN.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.455
DUN-DUN-DA

15:46.560 --> 15:47.413
- HA-HA.

15:47.530 --> 15:48.736
- OH, WOW.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.353
I WANT TO DRIVE THAT.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.599
- IT'S A COMMAND STATION
IN SPACE.

15:52.710 --> 15:54.086
YOU CAN'T DRIVE IT.

15:54.190 --> 15:55.418
- YOU CAN'T DRIVE
A COMMAND STATION?

15:55.540 --> 15:56.325
ALL RIGHT.

15:56.430 --> 15:58.113
- WE NEED MORE BLUE PIECES.

15:58.230 --> 16:00.778
- YEAH, GET 'EM FOR
THE COMMAND CENTER.

16:00.890 --> 16:05.918
YOU GOT TO HAVE BLUE PIECES.

16:06.030 --> 16:10.990
JENSEN, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.614
JENSEN, IF YOUR PARENTS WERE
GETTING MARRIED,

16:13.730 --> 16:14.958
WOULDN'T YOU BE EXCITED?

16:15.070 --> 16:17.959
- MY MOM AND DAD ARE MARRIED.
[murmurs]

16:18.080 --> 16:19.240
- RIGHT, RIGHT, YEAH.
I KNOW.

16:19.350 --> 16:21.386
UM, BUT LET'S SAY
THEY WEREN'T MARRIED.

16:21.490 --> 16:22.798
WOULDN'T YOU THINK
THAT WOULD BE

16:22.910 --> 16:25.310
LIKE THE COOLEST THING IN
THE WORLD IF THEY GOT MARRIED?

16:25.430 --> 16:27.489
- YOU'RE NUTS.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.669
- YOU THINK I'M--

16:28.780 --> 16:31.465
- I GOT MORE BLUE PIECES.

16:31.570 --> 16:33.777
- OKAY.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.462
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA--

16:36.580 --> 16:37.501
- SAY, "BYE."

16:37.610 --> 16:39.544
- ALL RIGHT, BYE.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.829
- HI, SARAH.
HI.

16:44.930 --> 16:45.965
- I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU.

16:46.070 --> 16:47.890
- IT'S JENNIFER.
- NO, I KNOW.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.991
IT'S--I GUESS KELSEY TALKED
TO YOU.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.897
- AMBER LEFT IT AT OUR PLACE,
SO.

16:53.010 --> 16:54.102
- OH.

16:54.220 --> 16:55.244
- JUST THOUGHT I'D SWING BY.

16:55.350 --> 16:56.521
YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE WAY
TO PILATES.

16:56.630 --> 16:58.552
- OH, HER IPOD.

16:58.670 --> 17:00.217
- THANK YOU FOR HALLOWEEN,
BY THE WAY.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.389
- [sighs]
I KNOW.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.968
I--I--I'M GLAD SHE TOLD YOU.

17:04.090 --> 17:06.706
- SHE HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME.

17:06.810 --> 17:08.289
ALL THOSE COSTUMES.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.960
IT SOUNDS LIKE SO MUCH FUN.

17:11.060 --> 17:12.573
YOUR DAD WAS LADY GAGA?

17:12.680 --> 17:13.647
I MEAN, I'VE GOT TO SEE
THE PICTURES.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.672
-S0 DO I.

17:15.790 --> 17:16.882
- OH, THAT'S SO GREAT.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.615
WE DON'T D%HHALLOWEEN.

17:18.720 --> 17:19.402
- I DON'T EAT SUGAR,
SO.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.409
- RIGHT.
- WHAT'S THE POINT?

17:22.520 --> 17:25.489
- YOU KNOW, UH...

17:25.590 --> 17:26.625
- ARE YOU OKAY?

17:26.730 --> 17:28.527
- I THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU BY NOW.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.973
UM, THE GIRLS WERE NOT HERE
FOR HALLOWEEN.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.809
- I'M SORRY?

17:32.910 --> 17:35.071
- THEY WENT TO A FRATERNITY
PARTY ACROSS THE BAY...

17:35.190 --> 17:36.214
- WHAT?

17:36.330 --> 17:39.390
- AND, UM, KELSEY ACTUALLY
GOT REALLY DRUNK.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.082
AMBER CALLED FROM THE PARTY AND
I WENT AND PICKED 'EM UP.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.293
KELSEY REALLY WANTED
TO TELL YOU HERSELF.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.709
- WELL, SHE DIDN'T.
[sighs]

17:45.820 --> 17:47.435
- RIGHT.

17:47.540 --> 17:49.986
- THAT DOES NOT SOUND
LIKE KELSEY.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.091
- I DON'T KNOW.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.441
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HER
FIRST BEER,

17:54.550 --> 17:55.778
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE TEENAGERS.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.482
- OH, SHE'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

17:58.590 --> 18:00.444
- OKAY, WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN--

18:00.560 --> 18:04.178
I'M REALLY SORRY.

18:16.780 --> 18:19.328
- OH, MY GOD!

18:19.440 --> 18:21.886
[coughs a
nd
AWW! gags]

18:26.480 --> 18:28.619
- DON'T WORRY.
POVERTY'S NOT CONTAGIOUS.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.722
- UM...
[chuckles]

18:30.830 --> 18:32.752
I KNOW.
I KNOW.

18:32.870 --> 18:35.384
UH...I SPILLED--

18:35.490 --> 18:37.799
A TRASH BAG BROKE
ON ME OUTSIDE ACTUALLY

18:37.900 --> 18:38.969
AND IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL,
YOU KNOW?

18:39.080 --> 18:40.763
I DON'T CARE IF TRASH
BREAKS ON ME.

18:40.870 --> 18:41.620
I CLEANED IT ALL UP.

18:41.740 --> 18:44.425
LIKE, I CLEANED IT UP.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

18:44.530 --> 18:45.872
- OH, YOU HEARD
OF DOUBLE-BAGGING, RIGHT?

18:45.980 --> 18:47.459
- YEAH.

18:47.570 --> 18:49.538
- TRY IT.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.748
- GREAT.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.104
- WHAT'S WRONG?

19:08.210 --> 19:09.620
WHAT HAPPENED?
- WHY? WHY?

19:09.730 --> 19:10.765
- WHY WHAT?

19:10.870 --> 19:12.622
- WHY WOULD YOU TELL
AFTER YOU PROMISED? WHY?

19:12.730 --> 19:15.665
- [sighs]

19:15.770 --> 19:18.694
HONEY, SHE TOLD ME
WHAT KELSEY HAD SAID.

19:18.810 --> 19:20.596
IT WAS AN ENORMOUS LIE.

19:20.710 --> 19:22.462
I COULDN'T PLAY ALONG.
- WELL, I'M SORRY.

19:22.570 --> 19:23.605
OF COURSE SHE'S GONNA LIE
ABOUT IT.

19:23.710 --> 19:25.598
SHE CAN'T TELL HER
THE TRUTH YET.

19:25.710 --> 19:26.699
- I WOULD HAVE HAD TO LIE TO.
- WELL, I'M SORRY.

19:26.820 --> 19:29.778
I REALLY NEEDED YOU TO NOT
SAY ANYTHING, MOM,

19:29.890 --> 19:33.053
BECAUSE NOW SHE WON'T LET ME
HANG OUT WITH KELSEY ANYMORE.

19:33.170 --> 19:34.194
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:34.310 --> 19:36.198
- SHE SAID THAT EVERYTHING
IS MY FAULT.

19:36.310 --> 19:37.516
SHE SAID THAT
I AM THE PROBLEM...

19:37.620 --> 19:38.587
- WHAT?

19:38.690 --> 19:40.339
- AND THAT I'M A BAD INFLUENCE
AND THAT KELSEY'S

19:40.450 --> 19:41.860
NOT ALLOWED TO HANG OUT
WITH ME ANYMORE.

19:41.970 --> 19:43.756
- HONEY, NO.
- YES, MOM.

19:43.870 --> 19:45.724
- PLEASE LISTEN.
I'LL CALL HER. I'LL FIX IT.

19:45.830 --> 19:47.036
- YOU CAN'T, MOM.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:47.150 --> 19:49.289
SHE WON'T LISTEN
AND SO NOW I DON'T GET

19:49.390 --> 19:51.312
TO HANG OUT WITH
MY ONE FRIEND HERE.

19:51.430 --> 19:54.149
MY ONE FRIEND
AND I'M ALL ALONE

19:54.260 --> 19:55.875
AND IT JUST SUCKS, MOM.

19:55.980 --> 19:56.730
I THOUGHT I COULD TRUST YOU.

19:56.850 --> 19:59.842
I'M VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED
WITH YOU.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.684
[door closes]

20:09.790 --> 20:11.200
- GOD.

20:16.970 --> 20:19.063
- IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, ADAM.

20:19.180 --> 20:20.454
DID YOU FIGURE OUT
WHO WE'RE GONNA CUT?

20:20.560 --> 20:22.937
- UH, YEAH, LISTEN.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.143
GORDON, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

20:24.250 --> 20:26.696
WE CAN BE MORE CREATIVE
ABOUT THESE LAYOFFS.

20:26.810 --> 20:27.834
- BRAVERMAN, LISTEN.

20:27.950 --> 20:29.770
- NO, JUST LISTEN TO ME
FOR A SECOND, GORDON.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.393
INSTEAD OF LAYOFFS,
WE CAN FURLOUGH.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.728
WE CAN HAVE FOUR-DAY
WORK WEEKS,

20:32.850 --> 20:34.943
THREE-DAY WORK WEEKS FOR SOME
PEOPLE, IF NECESSARY.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.436
THE BIG COMPANIES DO THIS.

20:36.540 --> 20:38.770
STATE GOVERNMENTS DO THIS.
IT'S BEEN PROVEN TO WORK.

20:38.890 --> 20:40.369
- LISTEN, ADAM, HOW CAN
I BE MORE CLEAR, OKAY?

20:40.480 --> 20:42.926
THIS ISN'T SOME CREATIVE
ASSIGNMENT, OKAY?

20:43.030 --> 20:44.645
I NEED TO FIRE SEVEN PEOPLE.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.786
- LOOK...THESE ARE PEOPLE,
OKAY?

20:47.900 --> 20:50.107
THAT WE HAVE WORKED
WITH FOR 15 YEARS.

20:50.210 --> 20:51.654
- YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT?

20:51.760 --> 20:53.819
STOP THINKING.
JUST DO IT, OKAY?

20:53.940 --> 20:58.593
YOU NEED ME TO COME UP THERE
AND HOLD YOUR HAND?

20:58.700 --> 21:00.315
- NO, GORDON.
THANK YOU.

21:00.430 --> 21:01.761
I'LL HANDLE IT.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.633
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD-BYE.

21:04.740 --> 21:07.732
- HEY, I'M GOING ON A--
- CAN'T YOU KNOCK?

21:07.850 --> 21:09.329
[door closes]

21:09.440 --> 21:10.919
[knock on door]

21:11.020 --> 21:13.079
COME IN.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.986
- COFFEE RUN.
DO YOU WANT ANYTHING?

21:15.100 --> 21:16.579
'CAUSE IT SURE SEEMS
LIKE YOU DO.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.329
- YES, I WOULD LOVE A COFFEE.
THANK YOU.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.409
- HEY, UM, GORDON ASKED ME OUT.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.579
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

21:23.690 --> 21:27.649
JUST CHECKING IT WITH YOU.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.761
- UNBELIEVABLE.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.930
- I GUESS IT'S NOT.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.621
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

21:33.740 --> 21:36.208
- HE'S A LITTLE...
PRICK!

21:36.320 --> 21:37.252
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.349
- I THOUGHT YOU GUYS LIKED
EACH OTHER.

21:38.460 --> 21:39.461
WHY SO HARSH?

21:39.570 --> 21:40.559
- LISTEN, SARAH,
I'VE KNOWN THIS GUY

21:40.670 --> 21:41.705
A LOT LONGER THAN YOU HAVE,
OKAY?

21:41.810 --> 21:43.493
- OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW
HIM DIFFERENTLY

21:43.610 --> 21:46.056
AND I'M GETTING TO KNOW HIM
OUTSIDE WORK, YOU KNOW?

21:46.160 --> 21:47.843
SO MAYBE WE JUST HAVE HAD
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES?

21:47.960 --> 21:48.676
- YEAH, I MEAN,
I DON'T KNOW WHO'D BE

21:48.790 --> 21:49.984
THE BETTER JUDGE
OF HIS CHARACTER.

21:50.100 --> 21:50.987
I MEAN, THE GUY WHO HE'S USED,

21:51.100 --> 21:52.783
ABUSED, AND LIED
TO FOR 15 YEARS,

21:52.890 --> 21:54.881
OR THE LATEST GIRL HE'S TRYING
TO GET IN BED.

21:55.000 --> 21:55.819
I DON'T KNOW.
- THANKS.

21:55.930 --> 21:57.136
- IT'S A TOUGH CALL.
- IT'S SUCH A COMPLIMENT.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.889
- SARAH, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.968
I'M REALLY SORRY,
BUT IF ANYBODY DOESN'T KNOW

22:01.070 --> 22:02.935
THIS GUY, IT'S YOU.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.600
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M GONNA
MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.669
BUT FOR YOU,
I'M GONNA DECIDE DECAF.

22:08.770 --> 22:10.044
- OH, OKAY.
GREAT, THANKS.

22:10.150 --> 22:11.253
- 'CAUSE I THINK YOU'RE
A LITTLE WORKED UP.

22:11.360 --> 22:15.535
- YEAH, MM-HMM.
THANK YOU.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.256
- HONEY, I'M HOME.

22:18.370 --> 22:19.598
- HEY, JULES!
IN HERE.

22:19.710 --> 22:21.154
HOW YOU DOING, BABY?
- HI, DAD.

22:21.270 --> 22:23.022
- COME ON IN.
POP A SQUAT.

22:23.130 --> 22:24.472
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

22:24.580 --> 22:26.855
SYDNEY HERE'S JUST TEACHING ME
THE FINE ART OF CHECKERS.

22:26.960 --> 22:27.779
- WHERE'S JOEL?

22:27.890 --> 22:29.198
- OH, JOEL IS STILL
AT THE JOB SITE.

22:29.310 --> 22:31.756
YOU KNOW HE'S SLAMMED.
POOR GUY.

22:31.860 --> 22:33.657
HE CALLED IN A PANIC
AND BECAUSE CAMILLE

22:33.760 --> 22:37.241
IS CURING HOMELESSNESS
AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER,

22:37.350 --> 22:39.272
I SHOWED UP LIKE A KNIGHT
IN SHINING ARMOR

22:39.390 --> 22:40.618
TO BE ON SYDNEY DUTY.

22:40.730 --> 22:42.004
- HE BROUGHT HIS HORSE.
- I DID.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.001
WHAT IS THIS?
- THAT'S DINNER.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.018
AND YOU'RE WELCOME.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.257
- IT IS REALLY GOOD, MOMMY.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.634
YOU SHOULD TRY SOME.

22:49.740 --> 22:52.254
GREASY GOODNESS.
RIGHT, GRANDPA?

22:52.370 --> 22:53.325
- UH-HUH.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.748
VERY GREASY.
GOES DOWN EASY.

22:54.850 --> 22:56.670
- NO, THANK YOU.

22:56.780 --> 22:57.883
- ALL RIGHT.

22:57.990 --> 22:59.332
HEY, GUESS WHAT.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.647
MY BUDDY SAYS THAT JOEL
IS DOING

23:01.750 --> 23:03.092
SUCH A GREAT JOB,
HE MAY WANT HIM

23:03.200 --> 23:04.303
TO REMODEL HIS WHOLE HOUSE.

23:04.410 --> 23:05.889
HOW ABOUT THAT?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.092
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

23:07.210 --> 23:09.519
- I AM VERY PROUD
OF MY SON-IN-LAW.

23:09.620 --> 23:10.962
SURE YOU DON'T WANT A SODA?

23:11.070 --> 23:14.551
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS IS
NOT EASY FOR ME.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.311
IT'S NOT EASY AT ALL.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.239
BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT
THIS COMPANY

23:19.360 --> 23:21.760
HAS NOT MADE THE PROFITS
WE HOPED IT WOULD.

23:21.880 --> 23:25.839
IN FACT, WE'RE--WE'RE WAY
IN THE RED.

23:25.950 --> 23:31.889
AND SO I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA
HAVE TO LAY YOU OFF.

23:31.990 --> 23:32.740
I'M VERY SORRY.

23:32.850 --> 23:34.408
I FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS

23:34.510 --> 23:35.499
AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW HOW MUCH

23:35.620 --> 23:37.997
I VALUED YOU WORKING HERE.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.989
- OKAY, HONEY, THAT WAS REALLY,
REALLY GOOD.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.510
- MM-HMM?

23:42.620 --> 23:43.587
- BUT YOU CAN'T START CRYING.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.248
- I WASN'T CRYING.

23:45.350 --> 23:46.794
- NO, DAD, MOM IS RIGHT.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.481
YOU CAN'T ASK SOMEBODY
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU EMOTIONALLY

23:48.590 --> 23:49.796
WHEN YOU'RE FIRING THEM.

23:49.910 --> 23:51.047
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M DOING.

23:51.150 --> 23:52.629
- WELL, OKAY.

23:52.740 --> 23:55.459
- THAT IS WHAT I'M DOING.

23:55.570 --> 23:57.083
YOU KNOW, FOR A TEENAGER, HONEY,
SOMETIMES YOU'RE--

23:57.190 --> 23:58.771
YOU'RE PRETTY WISE.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.848
- THANK YOU.

24:00.950 --> 24:03.191
THERE IS THIS GUY
AT THE FOOD BANK

24:03.300 --> 24:04.267
THAT I'M WORKING AT.

24:04.370 --> 24:05.598
HE TREATS ME LIKE
I'M AN IDIOT

24:05.720 --> 24:07.950
TEENIE BOPPER WITH, LIKE,
A BLEEDING HEART.

24:08.060 --> 24:11.951
AND, LIKE, EVEN IF I AM...
IT'S RUDE.

24:12.070 --> 24:14.026
- THAT IS RUDE.
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

24:14.140 --> 24:16.415
- IT'S, LIKE, SUBTLE THOUGH.
HE'S SO GOOD AT IT.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.101
- THAT'S THE WORST KIND.
- IT IS.

24:18.210 --> 24:20.030
HE'S THE WORST.

24:20.140 --> 24:22.108
AND, LIKE, JUST RESPECT
THE PEOPLE YOU'RE AROUND.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.177
- YEAH, WELL, LISTEN.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.861
IF YOU REALLY FEEL
LIKE HE'S BEING,

24:24.980 --> 24:26.379
YOU KNOW,
DERISIVE WITH THE LAUGHTER,

24:26.490 --> 24:27.878
YOU SHOULD CALL HIM ON IT.

24:27.980 --> 24:29.868
- I'D PUNCH HIM IN THE GROIN.
- YEAH.

24:29.980 --> 24:32.460
- KICK HIM WHERE IT COUNTS.
- I'M FINE.

24:32.570 --> 24:35.221
- GET HIM RIGHT IN THE--
- I DON'T CARE.

24:35.330 --> 24:37.946
- I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

25:06.980 --> 25:08.424
- YOU BUILT THE EIFFEL TOWER.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.565
- HAD TO GET DONE, DIDN'T IT?

25:10.680 --> 25:11.817
- LOOK AT YOU.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.979
YOU ROCK.

25:14.090 --> 25:18.026
ALTHOUGH YOU BUILT IT A LITTLE
TOO GOOD, IF YOU ASK ME,

25:18.130 --> 25:19.097
BUT THANK YOU.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.543
- SURE.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.891
- SHE AT LEAST, UH,
GO DOWN EASY TONIGHT?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.821
- IT WAS, UM, 6 BOOKS,
3 SONGS,

25:26.930 --> 25:29.728
AND AN I-O-U FOR 20 MINUTES
OF COMPUTER TIME.

25:29.830 --> 25:34.244
- YEAH, THAT'S A LOT.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.521
HEY, HOW'D IT GO WITH, UH,
ZEEK?

25:36.630 --> 25:40.976
- I'D REALLY RATHER
NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

25:41.090 --> 25:44.048
- ARE YOU PISSED BECAUSE
I CALLED YOUR DAD IN?

25:44.160 --> 25:46.537
- NO, I--NO, IT'S FINE.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.959
- YEAH?
- JUST, YEAH, WHATEVER.

25:48.060 --> 25:49.607
- 'CAUSE WHEN YOU SAY
IT'S FINE,

25:49.720 --> 25:51.574
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT FINE.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.056
- BABE!

25:53.170 --> 25:54.432
UP UNTIL 20 MINUTES AGO,
I WAS BUILDING

25:54.550 --> 25:56.199
A TINY LATTICE TOWER
OUT OF POPSICLE STICKS

25:56.310 --> 25:57.402
AND A GLUE GUN.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.896
NOW I NEED TO GET
THIS BRIEF WRITTEN

25:59.000 --> 26:02.891
FOR THE HEAD OF LITIGATION.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.934
- OKAY.

26:14.150 --> 26:17.085
[knock on door]

26:17.190 --> 26:19.078
- I PROPOSED TO JASMINE.

26:19.190 --> 26:20.157
- OH, MY GOD.

26:20.260 --> 26:25.220
- OPEN UP.

26:25.340 --> 26:26.955
BIG NEWS, HUH?
- WOW.

26:27.060 --> 26:29.437
- WORTH OPENING THE DOOR FOR.

26:29.550 --> 26:30.949
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

26:31.070 --> 26:32.332
- WAIT.
SHE SAID YES, RIGHT?

26:32.450 --> 26:34.031
- OH, YEAH.
CHEERS.

26:34.140 --> 26:36.961
- CONGRATULATIONS.
I AM, UH, BESIDE MYSELF.

26:37.070 --> 26:38.480
- YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING,
DID YOU?

26:38.590 --> 26:39.409
- CAN'T BELIEVE
MY LITTLE BROTHER'S

26:39.520 --> 26:42.933
GONNA TAKE THE PLUNGE.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.974
SOMETHING WRONG?

26:45.080 --> 26:46.115
- MM-MM.
NO.

26:46.220 --> 26:48.495
I'M--THIS--I'M GOOD.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.044
- UH-HUH.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.661
- JABBAR DOESN'T SEEM
TO GET IT THOUGH,

26:51.780 --> 26:53.156
WHICH IS KIND OF WEIRD.

26:53.260 --> 26:54.909
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE
DOESN'T GET IT?

26:55.020 --> 26:57.056
- WELL, I JUST EXPECTED HIM
TO BE REALLY EXCITED

26:57.160 --> 26:58.957
WHEN I TOLD HIM LIKE,
"WHOO! FIREWORKS!"

26:59.060 --> 27:03.099
AND HAPPILY EVER AFTER,
BUT HE DOESN'T REALLY CARE.

27:03.200 --> 27:05.088
- HE'S SIX.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.852
- YEAH, THAT'S, UH--

27:08.970 --> 27:12.269
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT JASMINE SAID.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.699
BUT, UH, I DON'T KNOW.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.415
I WAS REALLY EXCITED
TO TELL HIM AND HE JUST--

27:15.530 --> 27:16.622
YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T--

27:16.730 --> 27:18.140
- CROSBY, ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

27:18.250 --> 27:20.730
I THINK HE WAS PART
OF WHY I DID IT.

27:20.840 --> 27:24.139
- WELL, HOW BIG A PART?

27:24.260 --> 27:26.148
- PRETTY BIG PART.

27:26.260 --> 27:27.602
- MM-HMM.

27:27.710 --> 27:29.154
- DUDE, I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

27:29.260 --> 27:31.125
IT HAPPENED SO FAST.
- YEP, RIGHT.

27:31.230 --> 27:34.199
- IT WAS LIKE I JUST FELT
THIS IMMENSE PRESSURE BUILDING

27:34.300 --> 27:36.120
AND THEN THERE WAS
THIS MOMENT AND THEN

27:36.240 --> 27:38.128
I KIND OF GOT SWEPT UP IN IT
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

27:38.240 --> 27:40.094
I'M ASKING AND SHE'S SAYING
YES AND THEN--

27:40.210 --> 27:42.098
I JUST--MAYBE--I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S THAT

27:42.210 --> 27:44.349
OR I'M AFRAID THAT MAYBE MY LIFE
IS GONNA CHANGE

27:44.450 --> 27:45.963
AND I'M NOT READY FOR THAT.

27:46.070 --> 27:48.789
- IT'S COMPLETELY NATURAL
TO BE HAVING SOME DOUBTS.

27:48.900 --> 27:51.004
SO THE PROPOSAL
WAS UNPLANNED, ALL RIGHT?

27:51.110 --> 27:54.739
EVERYTHING WITH YOU AND JASMINE
AND JABBAR HAS BEEN UNPLANNED.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.068
I MEAN, YOU BACKED INTO IT,

27:56.190 --> 27:57.760
BUT IT'S REALLY WORKED OUT,
RIGHT?

27:57.880 --> 28:00.633
JASMINE--
SHE'S GREAT, RIGHT?

28:00.740 --> 28:02.799
- YEAH, SHE'S, LIKE, PERFECT.

28:02.920 --> 28:04.364
- YOU GOT A GREAT FAMILY,
RIGHT?

28:04.470 --> 28:08.531
- SHE IS GOOD
AND HE IS GREAT.

28:08.650 --> 28:10.197
- MM-HMM.

28:10.300 --> 28:14.851
- AND...
SO YOU JUST THINK IT'S NERVES?

28:14.960 --> 28:17.030
- YEAH, I THINK SO.

28:17.140 --> 28:19.301
AND I THINK IT'S NATURAL.
I DO.

28:19.420 --> 28:21.172
- YOU THINK SO?

28:21.280 --> 28:23.999
-IDO.

28:24.110 --> 28:25.099
- YOU DO?

28:25.220 --> 28:27.211
-IDO.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.665
- STOP SAYING, "I DO."

28:30.770 --> 28:33.466
- CONGRATULATIONS.

28:33.570 --> 28:36.698
- THANK YOU.

29:03.320 --> 29:07.017
- THIS IS IT.

29:15.470 --> 29:16.846
LOVE YOU, HONEY.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.815
- LOVE YOU TOO.
GOOD LUCK.

29:19.930 --> 29:22.023
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.

29:27.210 --> 29:29.303
- HEY.

29:29.420 --> 29:31.069
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:31.180 --> 29:33.171
- OH, ONE OF MY GUYS SCREWED UP
SOME WIRING

29:33.280 --> 29:34.520
AND IF I DON'T GET IN
AND FIX IT,

29:34.630 --> 29:36.860
THE CLIENT'S NEW RADIANT FLOOR
WILL JUST BE A FLOOR.

29:36.980 --> 29:38.424
- SO YOU'RE LEAVING RIGHT NOW?

29:38.530 --> 29:39.804
- I WROTE YOU A NOTE.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.320
YEAH, AND THERE'S SOME COFFEE
OVER THERE.

29:41.430 --> 29:43.113
- BABE, YOU CAN'T LEAVE
RIGHT NOW.

29:43.220 --> 29:44.949
I HAVE TO MAKE THAT CONFERENCE
CALL TO NEW YORK AND I JUST--

29:45.050 --> 29:46.256
- I KNOW. I KNOW.
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

29:46.370 --> 29:50.989
BUT I JUST GOT TO GET
IN EARLY ON THIS, JULES.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.887
- BABE, I CAN'T DO THIS.

29:52.990 --> 29:55.265
- WHAT CAN'T YOU DO?

29:55.370 --> 29:57.190
- I MEAN, I'M LEAVING
WORK EARLY, I'M COMING HOME,

29:57.310 --> 29:58.709
I'M WORKING ALL HOURS
OF THE NIGHT.

29:58.830 --> 30:00.092
YOU'RE NOT EVEN HERE.

30:00.210 --> 30:01.165
MY DAD'S HERE FEEDING
OUR CHILD CRAP AND--

30:01.280 --> 30:02.963
- IT'S NOT--IT'S ONE NIGHT.

30:03.070 --> 30:05.698
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:05.800 --> 30:07.893
IT'S BEEN A HARD WEEK,
BUT WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH IT.

30:08.010 --> 30:09.898
WE'RE RIGHT AT
THE TAIL END THERE.

30:10.010 --> 30:11.352
- WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT ONE?

30:11.460 --> 30:12.597
MY DAD TOLD ME THIS GUY WANTS
TO HIRE YOU AGAIN.

30:12.700 --> 30:13.871
ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?

30:13.980 --> 30:15.015
- YOU KNOW, I DON'T--

30:15.120 --> 30:16.212
I'M ONLY FOCUSED ON THIS JOB.

30:16.330 --> 30:18.116
I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET THROUGH THIS JOB.

30:18.230 --> 30:20.289
- OKAY, LISTEN, I KNOW WE SAID
THERE NEEDS TO BE

30:20.400 --> 30:22.015
MORE ROOM FOR YOU, ESPECIALLY
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

30:22.130 --> 30:24.223
A SECOND CHILD,
BUT I NEED TO UNDERSTAND--

30:24.330 --> 30:26.150
YOU KNOW, IS THIS WHAT
THAT LOOKS LIKE?

30:26.270 --> 30:27.225
- COME ON.

30:27.340 --> 30:29.023
- BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
IF WE CAN MANAGE IT.

30:29.130 --> 30:30.472
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKS.
HOW CAN WE MANAGE THIS?

30:30.580 --> 30:31.990
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.965
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT, OKAY?

30:34.070 --> 30:35.685
- WE NEED TO DISCUSS--
WE NEED TO DISCUSS THIS.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.178
CAN WE--OH, MY GOD.
- YES, YEAH, OKAY.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.656
LET'S DISCUSS THIS.
- WE JUST NEED TO DISCUSS IT.

30:38.760 --> 30:41.558
- YEAH, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

30:41.660 --> 30:43.628
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO WORK EVER.

30:43.730 --> 30:45.766
- OH, GIVE ME SOME CREDIT, JOEL.

30:45.870 --> 30:46.973
I MOVED MOUNTAINS--

30:47.080 --> 30:48.877
- I MOVED MOUNTAINS
OF YOU FOR YEARS, JULIA,

30:48.980 --> 30:51.084
AND THIS IS ONE WEEK
I'M ASKING FROM YOU.

30:51.190 --> 30:52.259
- I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE UNGRATEFUL.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.873
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FACE REALITY HERE.

30:53.990 --> 30:55.491
- OKAY, WHAT REALITY IS THAT?
JUST SPIT IT OUT.

30:55.610 --> 30:57.817
- THE REALITY IS THAT YOU'RE
WORKING ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.229
I'M WORKING MAD HOURS.
- YES.

31:00.340 --> 31:01.716
- THERE'S NO ONE WATCHING
OUR CHILD.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.879
- DON'T GET SO DRAMATIC.
- I MEAN--

31:04.000 --> 31:05.399
- THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE
TO TAKE CARE OF OUR KID.

31:05.510 --> 31:06.499
WE GOT A FAMILY TO TAKE--

31:06.620 --> 31:07.689
- WHAT AM I JUST SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE A DEPOSITION...

31:07.790 --> 31:08.859
- WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

31:08.970 --> 31:10.278
- I'M BILLING $600
AN HOUR FOR

31:10.380 --> 31:14.100
SO YOU GROUT
SOME GUY'S BATHROOM?

31:17.590 --> 31:19.797
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:19.910 --> 31:22.356
I MEAN, IF IT'S, UM--

31:22.460 --> 31:24.837
IF IT'S ABOUT WHOSE TIME
IS WORTH MORE, YOU WIN.

31:24.950 --> 31:26.212
- NO, THAT'S NOT--
[sighs]

31:26.330 --> 31:27.706
COME ON.

31:27.810 --> 31:30.984
HI, BABY.
- HEY, BABE.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.637
- ARE YOU AND DADDY FIGHTING?

31:32.750 --> 31:34.433
- NO, WE'RE NOT.

31:34.540 --> 31:37.668
- NAH, WE'RE JUST HAVING
A CONVERSATION HERE.

31:37.790 --> 31:39.018
- JUST TALKING.

31:39.130 --> 31:43.578
- JUST A LITTLE LOUDER
THAN NORMAL.

31:43.690 --> 31:44.611
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

31:44.730 --> 31:46.925
I'M TRYING TO BE PRACTICAL.

31:47.040 --> 31:50.453
I--I MEAN--

31:57.460 --> 32:00.429
SWEETIE.

32:00.530 --> 32:04.489
HEY, IT'S OKAY.

32:09.990 --> 32:13.437
- HAVE YOU HEARD FROM KELSEY?

32:13.550 --> 32:15.404
- UM, YEAH, BRIEFLY.

32:15.510 --> 32:18.582
SHE JUST--SHE TOLD HER MOM,
BUT, YOU KNOW--

32:18.690 --> 32:20.487
SHE CONFESSED EVERYTHING,
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T MATTER,

32:20.590 --> 32:23.002
'CAUSE HER MOM WOULD
STILL BLAME ME, SO.

32:23.110 --> 32:24.316
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.581
THAT'S REAL--IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

32:26.700 --> 32:28.793
REALLY NOT FAIR.

32:28.910 --> 32:30.696
I'M SURE SHE'LL COME AROUND.

32:30.810 --> 32:34.701
- MAYBE.

32:34.810 --> 32:36.732
[sighs]

32:39.640 --> 32:42.529
- HEY.

32:42.650 --> 32:44.641
I'M SORRY.

32:44.750 --> 32:48.129
I KNOW YOU'RE FEELING LONELY.

32:48.240 --> 32:51.266
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.

33:00.660 --> 33:03.356
- I'M FINE.

33:03.460 --> 33:05.599
SHE WAS A LITTLE WEIRD
ANYWAY.

33:05.700 --> 33:10.080
LET'S FACE IT.

33:10.190 --> 33:11.919
- YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

33:12.020 --> 33:12.918
- I KNOW THAT.

33:13.020 --> 33:14.362
- [clicking tongue]

33:14.470 --> 33:16.529
- NO, MOM.
DON'T TOUCH ME.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.608
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.744
THIS IS ENOUGH.

33:19.850 --> 33:22.364
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE THIS WAY WITH YOU?

33:22.480 --> 33:24.948
[knock on door]

33:25.070 --> 33:28.130
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

33:28.240 --> 33:30.481
- I CAME TO HELP.
[sighs]

33:30.590 --> 33:33.172
TO DO THIS WITH YOU.

33:37.220 --> 33:40.246
- IS THAT GLENFIDDICH 18
I SMELL?

33:40.360 --> 33:42.669
- [chuckles]
VERY ASTUTE.

33:42.770 --> 33:44.522
24, ACTUALLY.

33:44.640 --> 33:45.971
- LISTEN, GORDON, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS, ALL RIGHT?

33:46.090 --> 33:47.466
YOU CAN GO HOME.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

33:47.570 --> 33:49.709
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

33:49.820 --> 33:52.436
I JUST--
- YEAH.

33:52.540 --> 33:55.020
- I'M SO SORRY.
I REALLY AM, ADAM.

33:55.130 --> 33:57.849
- GO HOME.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.302
- I MEAN, IT'S JUST
NOT FAIR FOR ME

33:59.410 --> 34:01.549
TO LAY ALL THIS ON YOU,
RIGHT?

34:01.660 --> 34:05.448
- YOU KNOW, IT'S...

34:05.560 --> 34:08.654
NOT GONNA BE HELPFUL
FOR YOU TO APPEAR

34:08.770 --> 34:12.354
SO EMOTIONALLY UNDONE WHEN
YOU'RE FIRING PEOPLE, YOU KNOW?

34:12.460 --> 34:16.453
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T ASK THEM
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU EMOTIONALLY.

34:16.570 --> 34:19.459
IT'S OKAY, GORDON.

34:19.570 --> 34:24.769
- YOU ALWAYS
HANDLE EVERYTHING.

34:30.820 --> 34:33.823
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:33.930 --> 34:37.821
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:37.930 --> 34:39.613
THANKS, ADAM.

34:39.730 --> 34:41.652
- YEAH.

34:51.010 --> 34:52.045
- HEY.

34:52.150 --> 34:55.085
UH, CAN YOU HELP ME
FIX THIS,

34:55.190 --> 34:58.227
UM, WHISK ON
THE BIG MIXER GUY?

34:58.330 --> 35:00.605
- OR YOU COULD JUST READ
THE DIRECTIONS ON THE SIDE.

35:00.710 --> 35:04.601
- OKAY, UH...

35:04.720 --> 35:07.336
WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP TALKING
TO ME LIKE I'M AN IDIOT?

35:07.450 --> 35:09.953
- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

35:10.070 --> 35:11.924
- OKAY.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.792
THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM?

35:13.900 --> 35:16.653
DO YOU THINK THAT
I AM A LOSER

35:16.760 --> 35:19.456
BECAUSE I COME HERE
AND I CARE AND I TRY

35:19.560 --> 35:23.382
OR DO YOU JUST THINK THAT I'M
A PRIVILEGED LITTLE WHITE GIRL?

35:23.500 --> 35:25.456
- ARE YOU NOT GETTING
ENOUGH ATTENTION?

35:25.570 --> 35:29.495
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

35:29.610 --> 35:31.874
- UM, WELL,
I COME HERE EVERY DAY

35:31.990 --> 35:35.983
AND I GIVE 100% AND YOU SIT
THERE AND YOU JUDGE ME

35:36.090 --> 35:37.648
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

35:37.750 --> 35:39.058
- YES, I DO.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.331
KIDS LIKE YOU COME THROUGH
HERE ALL THE TIME.

35:41.440 --> 35:46.514
THEY THINK IT LOOKS GOOD
ON A COLLEGE APPLICATION.

35:46.620 --> 35:47.484
- YEAH, OKAY.

35:47.590 --> 35:49.444
SO I WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE.

35:49.560 --> 35:51.243
IS THAT A TERRIBLE THING?

35:51.350 --> 35:52.624
DOES THAT MAKE ME
A BAD PERSON?

35:52.730 --> 35:54.527
- NO, IT DOESN'T,
BUT YOU'RE HERE FOR A WEEK,

35:54.630 --> 35:56.006
MAYBE TWO AND THEN YOU'RE GONE.

35:56.110 --> 35:58.977
I GUESS YOU ALL SEEM
KIND OF...

35:59.080 --> 36:00.149
LIGHTWEIGHT TO ME SOMETIMES.

36:00.260 --> 36:02.353
NO OFFENSE,
BUT IT'S HARD ENOUGH

36:02.470 --> 36:06.566
FOR ME RUNNING THIS PLACE
WITHOUT ALL THAT TURNOVER.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.887
- SO I'M SORRY.

36:08.990 --> 36:11.299
YOU'RE JUST HERE AND YOU'RE
COMPLETELY SELFLESS

36:11.410 --> 36:13.059
AND THIS ISN'T A CAREER
PATH FOR YOU

36:13.170 --> 36:14.888
AND YOU DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE YOUR JOB?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.264
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

36:17.380 --> 36:19.439
IT'S MY JOB.
I GET PAID.

36:19.550 --> 36:20.585
IT'S A CAREER I'M
INTERESTED IN.

36:20.690 --> 36:22.612
- OKAY, GREAT.
THANK YOU. GOOD TO KNOW.

36:22.730 --> 36:25.449
- MOSTLY BECAUSE MY FAMILY
USED TO EAT HERE.

36:25.560 --> 36:29.690
THIS PLACE PROBABLY
SAVED MY LIFE.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.906
- OKAY.

36:33.010 --> 36:35.422
I'M SORRY.

36:35.530 --> 36:39.489
- CAN YOU JUST FIX THE MIXER?

36:39.610 --> 36:41.817
- YEAH, I KNOW.
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.603
- THANK YOU.

37:00.970 --> 37:03.382
- HEY, MARY.
- HI.

37:03.490 --> 37:06.527
- UM, COULD YOU COME
IN MY OFFICE FOR A SECOND?

37:06.630 --> 37:07.562
- SURE.

37:07.670 --> 37:11.140
- THANKS.

37:11.260 --> 37:13.467
AFTER YOU.

37:13.570 --> 37:16.186
- KEEP ON LOOKING

37:16.300 --> 37:17.608
YOU KEEP ON SEARCHING

37:17.710 --> 37:19.052
- GO AHEAD.
TAKE A SEAT.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.094
- KEEP ON MOVING

37:21.200 --> 37:24.328
TILL YOU GET
A LITTLE FURTHER

37:24.440 --> 37:25.407
- HEY.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.751

37:27.860 --> 37:29.066

37:29.170 --> 37:31.650
- OH, WHAT'S WRONG?

37:31.760 --> 37:35.070
- WELL, WE HAVE TO, UM...
FIRE A FEW PEOPLE.

37:35.180 --> 37:38.593
ADAM'S TAKING CARE OF IT NOW.

37:38.700 --> 37:41.043
- OH.

37:41.150 --> 37:42.253
I MEAN, AS THE BOSS--

37:42.360 --> 37:44.828

37:44.950 --> 37:47.566
WHO WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
FIRE YOU, RIGHT?

37:47.670 --> 37:51.219
- MMM.

37:51.330 --> 37:53.150

A GOOD MAN, SARAH.

37:53.270 --> 37:54.988
ONE OF THE BEST.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.785
- YEAH.

37:57.890 --> 37:59.858
- I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.951

38:02.070 --> 38:04.891
YOU KEEP ON ASKING

38:05.000 --> 38:07.969

38:19.600 --> 38:21.079
NEVER GIVE UP BELIEVING

38:21.190 --> 38:25.058

38:30.480 --> 38:33.813

38:33.930 --> 38:35.750
HEY.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.892
LISTEN, I'M SORRY FOR SNAPPING

38:41.000 --> 38:43.412
IT'S JUST, UH, YOU CAUGHT ME

38:43.520 --> 38:45.761
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

38:45.870 --> 38:47.861
- THERE PROBABLY ISN'T,
BUT IS THERE ANYTHING

38:47.980 --> 38:51.108
I CAN DO FOR YOU TODAY?

38:51.220 --> 38:52.903
- NO, I'M GOOD.

38:53.020 --> 38:54.044
- ADAM, YOU SHOULD FIRE ME.

38:54.150 --> 38:56.630
I'LL MAKE IT REALLY EASY
ON YOU.

38:56.740 --> 38:58.014
- YOU DON'T REALLY MAKE ENOUGH
FOR IT TO PAY OFF,

38:58.120 --> 38:59.872
SO YOUR JOB IS SAFE.

38:59.990 --> 39:02.879
