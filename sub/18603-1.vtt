03:45.580 --> 03:47.536
(Horse neighs)

03:59.220 --> 04:01.176
Somebody out there?

04:01.980 --> 04:03.936
Who?

04:04.020 --> 04:06.329
Who's out there? I got a gun by me.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.172
That you, Medford?

04:09.340 --> 04:12.650
- Who's that?
- Matt Weaver.

04:12.740 --> 04:14.696
Weaver.

04:14.780 --> 04:18.089
You stop right there, Weaver.
Don't you come no closer.

04:18.180 --> 04:19.533
You crazy?

04:19.620 --> 04:25.172
- What are you doing here?
- Doing? This is my farm.

04:25.860 --> 04:27.851
No more, it ain't.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.456
I'm warning you.

04:32.540 --> 04:36.089
- This is my house.
- No more, it ain't.

04:36.180 --> 04:40.332
- I bought it. From Sam Brewster.
- Brewster?

04:40.420 --> 04:43.969
Yeah, Brewster.
After Grant mustered us out.

04:44.060 --> 04:49.418
Why, this ain't been your house, Reb,
for pretty near three years.

04:49.500 --> 04:53.891
Now, you start walking off my land
and keep off.

05:29.460 --> 05:32.532
Welcome. Welcome home, Señor Matt.

05:32.620 --> 05:38.138
Home? It's been stolen out from under me
by this thieving town.

05:38.220 --> 05:42.099
My house is yours. A roof over your head.

05:42.180 --> 05:44.455
I aim to sleep under my own roof.

06:02.860 --> 06:05.818
- What's going on here, Billy?
- Matt Weaver.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.049
Weaver?

06:07.140 --> 06:10.177
He's got a gun.
He's heading for Brewster's.

06:10.260 --> 06:13.730
Tuttle! Hey, Tuttle! Tuttle!

06:13.820 --> 06:15.970
- What's the rumpus?
- The Reb is back.

06:16.060 --> 06:18.893
- It's the Reb?
- Tuttle!

06:18.980 --> 06:22.052
- Hey, Tuttle!
- Yes? What?

06:22.140 --> 06:24.574
- Matt Weaver's here.
- Jumping Joseph!

06:24.660 --> 06:28.812
(Kenarsie) Headed for Brewster's.
(Tuttle) With a gun?! Wait for me!

06:28.900 --> 06:32.131
- Crane, what is it?
- He's as big as life out there.

06:33.580 --> 06:36.413
- Matt Weaver.
- What?

06:37.660 --> 06:40.572
- I'll put a bullet through him.
- Crane, please.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.890
And end my nightmare for good and all.

06:42.980 --> 06:45.778
- Crane, you're drunk.
- Don't say it.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.131
Don't you ever say it.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.256
Oh, God!

07:02.060 --> 07:04.449
Brewster! Open up, Brewster!

07:05.500 --> 07:07.092
Brewster, open up!

07:07.180 --> 07:08.977
(Banging on door)

07:09.060 --> 07:11.016
Brewster!

07:13.900 --> 07:15.856
Brewster, open up!

07:17.700 --> 07:21.010
It's the Reb, sure enough,
pounding on Brewster's door.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.056
- Let's hurry!
- (Matt) Brewster!

07:24.460 --> 07:26.416
Brewster, I'm coming in.

07:48.980 --> 07:53.132
Come on down, Brewster,
or I'm coming up!

08:03.860 --> 08:06.090
Weaver!

08:11.420 --> 08:13.854
Stand clear!

08:13.940 --> 08:16.135
Crane!

08:17.420 --> 08:20.730
- Ruth.
- (Crane) It's between me and him.

08:22.540 --> 08:26.294
- You got him in the arm.
- I aimed for his Reb heart.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.577
Your performance
is never up to your intentions.

08:29.660 --> 08:32.936
Ruth, take Crane home.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.133
Welcome, Sheriff, welcome.

08:37.220 --> 08:42.010
Now that you're here,
is it in your capacity to arrest this man?

08:42.100 --> 08:45.376
- He broke into my house, tried to kill me.
- Kill?

08:47.260 --> 08:50.491
- I came here to ask about my farm.
- To ask?

08:51.060 --> 08:56.134
Ask and it will be given thee,
but with a rifle in your hands...

08:56.220 --> 08:58.176
Matt. Come on, Matt.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.256
Sheriff.

09:14.580 --> 09:18.175
Matt, get a hold of yourself.
Put Brewster out of your mind.

09:18.260 --> 09:20.899
You're trying to take on a whole town,
not one man.

09:20.980 --> 09:23.813
Old folks and womenfolks and Mexicans,

09:23.900 --> 09:27.336
a couple of cripples like Crane,
that's what this town is.

09:27.420 --> 09:32.813
But you come back on your own legs,
swinging your own arms,

09:32.900 --> 09:35.130
seeing out of both your eyes.

09:38.260 --> 09:40.216
Well, I found my daddy.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.736
In Tennessee.

09:45.420 --> 09:49.049
It was my daddy, all right,
but his head was shot off.

09:54.180 --> 09:58.014
So, er... I picked up his rifle.

09:59.820 --> 10:01.811
Picked up where he left off.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.576
And I stayed to the end.

10:07.220 --> 10:10.132
The end. Now it's over.
The war's over.

10:10.220 --> 10:12.336
- Not here, it ain't.
- No, sir.

10:13.580 --> 10:16.731
Not while Brewster can keep it going.

10:16.820 --> 10:19.937
He said Medford bought my farm
from Brewster.

10:20.020 --> 10:24.616
Well, how did Brewster get it?
How did Brewster get it?

10:24.700 --> 10:30.730
When they auctioned it off, nobody
had any ready cash except for Brewster.

10:30.820 --> 10:36.258
- Anted up just to keep things legal.
- Legal?

10:36.340 --> 10:39.093
Legal? We was mustered out
to return home.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.297
Articles of surrender
didn't mention confiscation.

10:42.380 --> 10:45.929
Hey, boy, you just lost a pint of blood.
You quiet down.

10:46.020 --> 10:49.057
So Brewster picked up my farm cheap,

10:49.140 --> 10:51.335
sold at a profit to Medford?

10:53.380 --> 10:59.410
Just widows and old folks dying off,
and who's picking up their leavings?

10:59.500 --> 11:01.730
You get out of this town, boy.

11:07.580 --> 11:12.131
Comes morning, you're still here,
pick up your gear and walk out of here.

11:12.220 --> 11:14.336
Keep walking. Never come back.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.056
(Church bells)

12:02.980 --> 12:05.335
- What's the holy racket?
- Church summons.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.980
- On Tuesday morning?
- Funeral for John Medford.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.097
Crazy Reb killed Medford
out at his farm last night.

12:17.620 --> 12:19.656
This is the meetingest town.

12:23.260 --> 12:27.173
- How long is the stop here?
- In Pecos, no longer than I can help.

12:27.260 --> 12:29.694
Quarter-hour, maybe.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.288
Our good reverend, Father McMichaels,

12:33.380 --> 12:37.134
has given me leave
to speak a few words

12:37.220 --> 12:40.417
over the body of my friend and yours.

12:42.100 --> 12:45.251
A Union hero of Apache Canyon.

12:46.980 --> 12:51.690
One of the few to return to us
from that valley of death.

12:53.580 --> 12:57.255
May John Medford's soul rest in peace.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.296
(AIl) Amen.

13:01.860 --> 13:04.499
Peace for John Medford,

13:05.460 --> 13:07.610
but not for us, my friends, not yet.

13:08.420 --> 13:11.856
This morning, we woke up to find
that we've got still another widow

13:11.940 --> 13:15.091
in a town
that's already got more than its share,

13:15.180 --> 13:18.013
and she was widowed
by a Reb, Matt Weaver.

13:19.180 --> 13:22.297
No, the war is not over for us, friends.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.336
This confederate soldier -

13:24.420 --> 13:27.776
he's still in uniform, mind,
still bearing arms -

13:27.860 --> 13:32.012
invaded this township,
broke into my house, broke out of jail,

13:32.100 --> 13:34.056
if you believe our good sheriff.

13:34.140 --> 13:38.292
And in the secret places
he did smite to death an innocent.

13:38.380 --> 13:42.373
I put it to you,
how do we smite this enemy of the Lord?

13:42.460 --> 13:45.418
Now, listen here. You listen here to me.

13:47.180 --> 13:49.455
I brung the first wagons in.

13:49.540 --> 13:52.179
I can bring this rebel boy in to stand trial.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.252
I got to bring him in.

13:56.340 --> 14:00.731
We're not forgetting what you done
when you was able, you old warhorse.

14:00.820 --> 14:03.380
We won't send you out
to get cut down by a crazy Reb.

14:03.460 --> 14:06.133
Suppose you tell us
what you're working us up to.

14:06.220 --> 14:12.011
Lacking a posse
or a sheriff able to do the job,

14:12.100 --> 14:15.775
come to me, we could call on
the US Marshal in Santa Fe for help.

14:15.860 --> 14:21.218
Except the US Marshal's got a territory
full of looters and Rebs to clean up.

14:21.300 --> 14:24.053
They got a backlog a year long.

14:24.140 --> 14:28.452
But we can't wait a year. We can't wait
a week. Business will go to pot.

14:28.540 --> 14:33.295
How many more
can Matt Weaver widow in a year?

14:33.380 --> 14:37.453
I hear you, Mr McKeever,
so I'm digging into my own pocket.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.532
I sent Crane Adams to Amarillo
to hire a lawman

14:41.620 --> 14:44.498
able to flush that Reb out of these hills

14:44.580 --> 14:47.413
and end this war we thought was over.

14:48.820 --> 14:53.291
A lawman, Mr Brewster?
Crane went to find a gunfighter.

14:53.380 --> 14:57.578
A gunfighter kills the man he goes after.
No trial, no jury.

14:57.660 --> 14:59.616
Guilty or innocent, he kills him.

14:59.700 --> 15:03.534
- Are you asking us to believe...?
- I'm asking you nothing, Mrs Adams.

15:03.620 --> 15:05.975
Women don't vote here.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.497
You turning this funeral service
into a meeting, Sam?

15:12.580 --> 15:15.253
Well, I've got a vote.

15:15.340 --> 15:19.538
And I'm asking you, are you saying
we're not gonna hear Matt's side of it?

15:19.620 --> 15:22.054
Dispense with
the whole due process of law?

15:22.140 --> 15:26.611
How many here besides me lost sons?
Hands! Hands!

15:26.700 --> 15:30.693
How many here lost husbands? Hands!

15:30.780 --> 15:33.897
Due process of law, Barker, in wartime?

15:33.980 --> 15:38.292
Until every last murdering Reb
lays down his arms, it's still war,

15:38.380 --> 15:42.293
and we got a new widow in our midst
that needs our help.

15:42.380 --> 15:46.453
Stint not, brother. Stint not. Give.

15:46.540 --> 15:51.694
Give and it shall be given unto you.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.056
All aboard!

16:01.060 --> 16:03.369
You paid through to Santa Fe.

16:05.140 --> 16:07.415
Found you a little life, huh?

16:09.660 --> 16:11.616
Don't look for it to last.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.056
Giddup!

16:29.300 --> 16:30.733
How did it go?

16:30.820 --> 16:34.176
Medford's gone for good
and Weaver's good as gone.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.216
I'll take over.

16:41.060 --> 16:44.450
You sure you want this side of town?

16:44.540 --> 16:47.418
Mexican town's just over the wash.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.136
You'll be a sight more comfortable here.

17:03.220 --> 17:06.098
Billy, take Mr...

17:06.180 --> 17:09.137
Take the gentleman's bags
up to number five, front.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.972
Staying long, Mr...?

17:53.100 --> 17:56.012
(Horses approach)

17:56.100 --> 17:58.660
(Whistling)

18:25.820 --> 18:28.254
You knew I'd open for that signal.

18:34.740 --> 18:37.652
Well, who's out there? Crane? Who else?

18:37.740 --> 18:39.776
Nobody's out there.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.689
I came here to find out for myself.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.891
Did you kill John Medford?

18:52.580 --> 18:54.810
Well, I went crazy.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.854
I tried to scare him off with bullets.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.817
Well, old Medford come out
with his hands up.

19:03.900 --> 19:05.652
To talk, he said.

19:05.740 --> 19:09.858
No guns, he said, so I put down mine.
He got close and pulled this.

19:12.340 --> 19:14.456
He missed and I didn't.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.650
Ruth, I swear that's what happened.

19:20.300 --> 19:24.612
If I believed you, what difference would
it make? The whole town is after you.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.656
I know.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.694
Five weeks walking here, Ruth.

19:34.860 --> 19:38.409
And now I get here and...

19:41.100 --> 19:42.852
Ruth, I'm tore up.

19:42.940 --> 19:45.090
Not just Medford.

19:45.180 --> 19:47.853
You and Crane, how could you marry?

19:50.060 --> 19:52.096
If you ever came back,

19:52.180 --> 19:55.809
I wanted to be sure
that I wouldn't be waiting for you.

19:55.900 --> 19:59.017
Well, you fixed it sure, all right.

19:59.100 --> 20:04.891
You never believed that I cared that much
about men buying and selling other men.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.936
You wouldn't let yourself care.

20:07.020 --> 20:11.138
You didn't love me enough to stop doing
the one thing that could finish us for good.

20:11.220 --> 20:14.815
- I told you I had to go find my daddy!
- That is not why you went!

20:14.900 --> 20:17.733
You went because
you're pigheaded like your father.

20:17.820 --> 20:21.608
Because you couldn't do like the rest
if it killed you.

20:26.260 --> 20:28.216
Matt.

20:34.260 --> 20:38.458
Yell at me again. It feels real homelike.

20:42.380 --> 20:47.454
You were such a mean, stubborn boy,
it was the only way I could make you listen.

20:49.460 --> 20:52.179
I used to wonder if you'd ever grow up.

21:00.740 --> 21:02.810
And you never did. Hold that.

21:08.980 --> 21:13.053
I grew up, but you're right,
I never was much on reasonableness.

21:13.140 --> 21:17.930
And having my farm stole out from me
doesn't make me any more so.

21:18.020 --> 21:20.090
You never were
and you never will be.

21:20.180 --> 21:22.136
I'm glad I didn't wait for you.

21:22.220 --> 21:24.336
Are you happy with Crane?

21:26.500 --> 21:28.616
Crane left town yesterday.

21:29.780 --> 21:31.816
He went...

21:31.900 --> 21:33.856
He went to find a gunfighter.

21:33.940 --> 21:37.455
Gunfighter? To fight what?

21:37.540 --> 21:39.496
To fight you.

21:41.980 --> 21:43.936
Brewster.

21:46.260 --> 21:48.410
It'll take Crane a week.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.219
If you leave now, they'll never find you.

21:52.700 --> 21:55.339
That's my mother's grave out there, Ruth.

21:55.420 --> 21:59.857
I planted them vines on the porch.
I live here till I die.

21:59.940 --> 22:04.695
Sooner or later, however long I live,
I'll fight the town for the right to die here.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.456
Now you answer me.

22:11.980 --> 22:13.936
You happy?

22:15.260 --> 22:17.216
Happy?

22:18.540 --> 22:22.374
This is the house
I was going to live in until I died.

22:22.460 --> 22:27.295
You planted vines.
I knew where I was going to plant roses.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.018
I loved you.

22:29.820 --> 22:32.573
I loved you so much
that now I hate you

22:32.660 --> 22:34.730
because you're a thief, Matt.

22:34.820 --> 22:38.051
You stole yourself away from me
for nothing.

22:38.140 --> 22:40.290
For nothing.

22:40.380 --> 22:43.133
You stole my rightful life away from me.

23:05.220 --> 23:08.929
I got a half-dollar
says he's a skinny runt tied to a big gun.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.490
Them skinny runts get handy with a gun.
They got to, you know.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.289
Wait here. I'll go find Brewster.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.496
Dancer.

23:52.300 --> 23:55.610
Let me through.
Let me through, please.

23:55.700 --> 23:58.533
Mr Brewster, this is Mr Dancer.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.372
Good morning, sir.

24:00.460 --> 24:04.339
You one-armed toad! Drag me 100 miles
in that hearse for what?

24:04.420 --> 24:07.776
For nothing!
Your brain's rotten with booze.

24:24.020 --> 24:27.695
- Mr Brewster...
- Can't you do nothing right?

24:27.780 --> 24:30.692
I sent you after a gunfighter.
What did you come back with?

24:30.780 --> 24:32.736
How do you find a gunfighter?

24:32.820 --> 24:34.970
You don't go to church.

24:35.060 --> 24:37.051
You go to a saloon.

24:37.140 --> 24:41.053
Saloon keeper says the top gun
is a fella by the name of Jewel,

24:42.220 --> 24:45.053
but he had to move on
and now we're using Dancer,

24:45.140 --> 24:47.938
so I tell Dancer we're paying $300...

24:48.020 --> 24:52.059
And you pay his coach fare here,
and where is he now?

24:52.140 --> 24:54.574
Here. He's here. Jewel.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.776
- Where?
- There.

25:06.540 --> 25:09.373
- Your name Jewel?
- No.

25:09.460 --> 25:11.132
The hotel register.

25:18.420 --> 25:19.773
My name is...

25:23.180 --> 25:24.977
Jules...

25:26.980 --> 25:28.936
Gaspard...

25:33.700 --> 25:35.975
D'Estaing.

25:36.780 --> 25:39.613
Jules... soft J, silent S.

25:40.180 --> 25:42.171
Gaspard... silent D.

25:42.260 --> 25:44.728
D'Estaing... just a touch of diphthong.

25:44.820 --> 25:46.970
Touch of diphthong?

25:47.060 --> 25:51.019
Well, try Jules.

25:52.620 --> 25:54.611
Jewel.

25:54.700 --> 25:57.498
That J is still a little hard.

25:57.580 --> 26:00.697
- Try this. Zzh.
- Zzh.

26:02.380 --> 26:08.376
No. I'm just gonna call you,
if I need you, Jewel.

26:09.940 --> 26:14.138
Step along to my office now. I'll find out
soon enough if I'm gonna need you.

26:14.220 --> 26:15.733
How many steps?

26:18.820 --> 26:22.130
Right down the street here to the bank.

26:22.900 --> 26:26.176
The bank... where the money's kept.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.649
Too hot.

26:34.980 --> 26:36.936
You a gunfighter?

26:43.060 --> 26:45.733
We got a little problem round here.

26:45.820 --> 26:49.893
It's quite a story. Quite a story.

26:49.980 --> 26:52.369
- There's this Reb...
- Where?

26:52.460 --> 26:54.610
On this farm he owns.

26:55.660 --> 26:58.732
Just a short ride out of town.

26:58.820 --> 27:01.288
Horseback ride?

27:01.380 --> 27:03.450
I stay off horses.

27:03.540 --> 27:07.613
Well, I guess you could walk it.

27:07.700 --> 27:11.375
I'm not much for walking, either.

27:11.460 --> 27:15.169
I'll take care of your Reb. $500.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.691
I am not Dancer.

27:18.780 --> 27:20.736
I will take his $300 on account.

27:21.980 --> 27:24.255
Now.

27:24.340 --> 27:27.332
There... in your breast pocket.

27:40.140 --> 27:42.415
The banker's sweating.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.458
My hotel room's cooler.

27:55.660 --> 27:58.618
(Man wheezes and laughs)

28:23.740 --> 28:25.696
After the time you've wasted for us,

28:25.780 --> 28:29.455
you'd better pray
this Jewel's what they say he is

28:29.540 --> 28:32.100
and does what he says he'll do.

28:32.180 --> 28:35.217
That's two things I'm settling right now.

28:50.900 --> 28:54.256
- I'm back.
- I put your coffee on your desk.

29:12.900 --> 29:16.495
What I want to hear
is how you're going to earn your money.

29:16.580 --> 29:20.289
- With a bullet in his back, no doubt.
- In his...

29:22.020 --> 29:26.969
What I am talking about
is you're here, and he's out there.

29:27.060 --> 29:29.051
Now, you won't ride.
You won't walk.

29:29.140 --> 29:31.096
He will have to come to me.

29:31.180 --> 29:33.455
He can't work a farm under siege.

29:33.540 --> 29:35.849
He's been shooting his food.

29:35.940 --> 29:39.535
Every sunup
we hear his rifle cracking away.

29:39.620 --> 29:42.134
Weaver's always been a dead shot.

29:42.220 --> 29:44.211
Not with an empty rifle.

29:45.340 --> 29:49.618
Now, where would a man
buy or steal bullets in this town?

29:49.700 --> 29:51.850
The emporium.

29:51.940 --> 29:54.977
Suppose I'm tired of this hotel room,

29:55.060 --> 29:59.258
and the emporium might seem
more... homelike.

29:59.340 --> 30:04.368
Not hardly. The Adamses live upstairs.
Crane might, but Ruth...

30:04.460 --> 30:08.009
The way you walked into my room,
I'd say you owned the hotel.

30:08.100 --> 30:11.729
Wouldn't surprise me if you owned
a piece of every business in this town.

30:13.540 --> 30:18.489
I own more than a piece
of the emporium. I can tell you that.

30:18.580 --> 30:24.177
So you see, I have more faith
in your powers of persuasion than you do.

30:26.700 --> 30:30.739
I'll put it to Crane. If a man
know not how to rule his own house...

30:30.820 --> 30:32.776
Is he a man?

30:36.780 --> 30:38.771
Yes, sir.

30:38.860 --> 30:42.933
Catch Weaver red-handed stealing.

30:43.020 --> 30:46.808
That is a cut above a bullet in the back,
you got to admit.

30:50.140 --> 30:53.815
Hear you held a town meeting
the other day. How did they vote?

30:54.500 --> 30:56.456
Who?

30:58.780 --> 31:01.772
- Mexicans?
- Don't vote.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.816
Live here.

31:06.420 --> 31:10.811
Around about. They go their way,
we go ours. Two separate towns, like.

31:10.900 --> 31:13.653
- And farmers?
- Work our farms if they want to eat.

31:13.740 --> 31:16.573
- Don't eat much.
- Don't need much. They're different.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.890
I can see
how you could afford to go Union.

31:18.980 --> 31:22.689
We went Union
because we're against sedition and slavery.

31:22.780 --> 31:25.089
And sin.

31:25.180 --> 31:27.853
All but one die-hard Reb.

31:27.940 --> 31:31.250
Well... let's close him out.

32:06.220 --> 32:08.176
(Laughs)

32:20.460 --> 32:26.569
- Ruth! Mrs Adams, this is Mr Jewel.
- Yes.

32:26.660 --> 32:29.128
Well, Crane,
I brought you some business, boy.

32:29.220 --> 32:31.893
A bit out of your line, maybe.
I got a boarder for you.

32:31.980 --> 32:37.657
A boarder, for a couple of days.
Mr Jewel don't fancy the hotel much.

32:37.740 --> 32:40.777
- We don't take in boarders.
- First time for everything.

32:40.860 --> 32:45.570
- We don't take in boarders. Ruth!
- (Brewster) I'm putting it to you.

32:45.660 --> 32:49.369
- What's Ruth got to do with it?
- The work.

32:49.460 --> 32:53.009
A woman's work is never done
in a boarding house, I'm sure.

32:53.100 --> 32:59.175
I've been meaning to take a long look
at these books of yours, first chance I got.

33:14.820 --> 33:19.371
Crane, boy, you can't afford
not to take a boarder.

33:19.460 --> 33:22.816
You'll find Mrs Adams here
sets a nice table.

33:22.900 --> 33:27.735
You heard. You'll be doing the work.
If you don't want him here, speak up!

33:27.820 --> 33:30.812
- Well, that's all settled.
- Yes.

33:31.740 --> 33:35.255
- I'll be on my way now.
- If you'll show me the way.

33:37.020 --> 33:39.056
Certainly.

33:56.020 --> 34:00.571
Oh. A spare room. Means room to spare.

34:01.620 --> 34:05.090
- It was never a question of room.
- Yes, just the company.

34:05.860 --> 34:08.135
I do hope you don't find me
too troublesome.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.933
And what if I do?

34:11.980 --> 34:16.178
Isn't it easier to keep an eye on me here
than from your front steps?

34:25.780 --> 34:27.735
(Knock on door)

35:50.780 --> 35:53.533
(Plays a tune)

35:53.620 --> 35:55.212
It's Crane's.

35:56.300 --> 35:58.609
He... played beautifully.

36:03.940 --> 36:05.896
(Plays beautifully)

36:44.500 --> 36:46.456
(Hums)

37:01.180 --> 37:03.853
(Speaks) Sleep well, my child

37:05.460 --> 37:08.258
Silvery dreams be thine

37:10.060 --> 37:12.779
May happiness

37:12.860 --> 37:14.816
Illume your way

37:17.100 --> 37:19.489
Comme dans chaque vie

37:20.780 --> 37:23.214
Bien qu'il soit tôt ou tard

37:24.180 --> 37:29.208
On dit qu'il faux qu'il tombe
un peu de pluie

37:29.300 --> 37:32.770
French! That was French.

37:34.780 --> 37:38.170
- You French?
- Creole.

37:38.260 --> 37:40.330
Creole?

37:41.420 --> 37:44.173
New Orleans?

37:44.260 --> 37:46.728
Born in New Orleans?

37:48.660 --> 37:50.616
(Laughs)

37:51.860 --> 37:53.976
It's funny.

37:54.060 --> 37:56.016
Don't you see the joke?

37:56.100 --> 38:01.015
Joke's on Brewster.
We hired a Reb to kill a Reb!

38:01.100 --> 38:03.933
Born in New Orleans, but no Reb.

38:04.020 --> 38:05.976
- Union?
- No.

38:06.060 --> 38:08.290
Well, now...

38:09.340 --> 38:11.570
Let's just hear how you managed that.

38:11.660 --> 38:15.448
- Managed to be in Mexico.
- Sat it out. Slacker, eh?

38:16.580 --> 38:19.174
Reb or slacker,
which makes you feel better?

38:19.260 --> 38:24.573
Nothing can make me
feel better about you. Put nothing past you.

38:24.660 --> 38:27.652
Know what I think?
I think you're lying straight through.

38:27.740 --> 38:31.050
- Creole? I say you're Mexican.
- Crane.

38:32.580 --> 38:35.697
I'll tell you what I am and what you are.

38:37.100 --> 38:40.649
I am a man with a gun, and you're drunk.

38:40.740 --> 38:42.696
Please go.

38:47.220 --> 38:49.176
Good night.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.649
Deuces wild.

39:11.140 --> 39:14.018
I'll open with a dollar.

39:14.100 --> 39:16.409
- I call.
- I'm out.

39:18.580 --> 39:21.014
A dollar... and raise you 15.

39:23.980 --> 39:25.493
I'm out.

39:30.300 --> 39:32.256
- Call.
- Out.

39:34.700 --> 39:36.975
Light.

39:37.060 --> 39:38.095
Cards?

39:40.820 --> 39:42.651
Two.

39:44.100 --> 39:46.614
One.

39:46.700 --> 39:48.418
One for the dealer.

40:00.780 --> 40:02.338
I bet 25.

40:03.260 --> 40:04.295
Out.

40:07.340 --> 40:09.092
25...

40:10.180 --> 40:12.899
and 25 better.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.456
I call you, dammit.

40:20.340 --> 40:21.819
Beat four aces!

40:23.660 --> 40:25.218
Five kings.

40:27.540 --> 40:28.734
Show 'em!

40:30.940 --> 40:33.693
Four kings... and a deuce.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.056
No deuce.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.170
- Five kings.
- You...

40:43.340 --> 40:45.217
What? What's this?

40:45.300 --> 40:47.814
Never dealt a hand like that before.

40:49.660 --> 40:51.252
Never seen such a town.

40:51.340 --> 40:53.376
Nobody challenges the deal.

40:54.420 --> 40:57.093
Brewster's trained you.

40:57.180 --> 40:59.296
Mr Tuttle will collect for me.

41:03.060 --> 41:05.369
I'll come by for my money tomorrow.

41:07.660 --> 41:12.529
Your own hired hand, and you're
letting him thieve you and walk away.

41:12.620 --> 41:15.180
(McKeever) Jewel! We hired your gun.

41:15.260 --> 41:18.218
Might favour us
with a sharpshooting exhibition.

41:18.300 --> 41:20.575
Tomorrow, maybe?

41:20.660 --> 41:22.696
(Scream)

41:35.620 --> 41:40.694
Fancy shooting exhibition
tomorrow night. Bring your friends.

41:44.340 --> 41:47.173
(Man laughs)

41:59.740 --> 42:01.173
Crane?

42:08.020 --> 42:10.295
Don't tell me
the boarder made it home first.

42:10.380 --> 42:12.098
I heard shots. They woke me.

42:14.380 --> 42:18.009
Just a little gunplay in the saloon.
Nobody hurt.

42:18.100 --> 42:20.660
Gunplay?

42:20.740 --> 42:22.696
Guns are playthings to you?

42:23.820 --> 42:25.776
Play and work, Mrs Adams.

42:28.060 --> 42:30.016
Work and play.

42:36.700 --> 42:38.656
(Harpsichord music)

43:03.700 --> 43:06.851
Tell me something. The truth.

43:08.860 --> 43:10.816
I never lie.

43:14.140 --> 43:16.096
I...

43:17.140 --> 43:19.700
I have this feeling that you...

43:19.780 --> 43:22.294
that you are playing with us, all of us.

43:22.380 --> 43:24.336
And...

43:25.380 --> 43:29.578
that you really don't intend to do
what you've been paid to do.

43:29.660 --> 43:32.493
Is that a question or a request?

43:33.900 --> 43:35.856
I'm not sure.

43:35.940 --> 43:37.896
Maybe both.

43:40.460 --> 43:42.416
First smile.

43:43.900 --> 43:46.095
First in a long time.

43:47.660 --> 43:49.969
Much longer since I've laughed.

43:50.060 --> 43:52.528
My mother used to scold me
for laughing too much.

43:52.620 --> 43:54.576
Is that why you stopped?

43:56.220 --> 43:58.654
My mother died, and my father.

43:59.700 --> 44:04.899
When the war reached us here,
I don't know, one day I stopped laughing.

44:04.980 --> 44:06.936
You were not born here.

44:07.020 --> 44:08.976
New England.

44:09.060 --> 44:11.255
In a white town in a green valley.

44:12.820 --> 44:14.776
I wish we'd never left.

44:17.540 --> 44:21.818
This came from New England
with Crane's family.

44:21.900 --> 44:25.256
Nothing good
comes from the savage South.

44:25.340 --> 44:28.650
I'm not one of those Northerners
who despises the whole South.

44:28.740 --> 44:30.696
We knew a family here that...

44:31.940 --> 44:33.896
Well, a Southern family.

44:33.980 --> 44:37.768
They were wonderful people.
Warm, kind, happy.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.730
Your second smile.

44:46.820 --> 44:48.856
You didn't answer my question.

44:50.220 --> 44:52.609
Will I do what I have been paid to do?

44:55.540 --> 44:57.974
What would I gain by answering it?

45:08.140 --> 45:11.257
Well, your second smile
was your last for a while.

45:11.340 --> 45:13.570
I'll answer your question.

45:13.660 --> 45:16.413
I'm in business for money.
And pleasure, too.

45:16.500 --> 45:20.254
A town that hires a gunfighter is always
a henhouse with just one rooster,

45:20.340 --> 45:23.093
a few fat capons,
a few clipped wings.

45:23.180 --> 45:25.740
What happens
when a man with a gun walks in?

45:25.820 --> 45:28.618
That's play, Mrs Adams. Fun!

45:28.700 --> 45:32.409
When the fun is over, I'll pull the trigger.

45:35.340 --> 45:38.776
Where does Crane go at night?
Why does he drink?

45:38.860 --> 45:41.090
What is Matt Weaver to Crane?

45:41.180 --> 45:43.136
What is he to you?

45:44.220 --> 45:45.289
Tell me.

45:46.180 --> 45:48.978
Was Crane a whole man
before he lost his arm?

45:49.740 --> 45:51.617
Are you a whole woman?

46:37.020 --> 46:39.932
- Always this hot in Pecos?
- Hm?

46:40.020 --> 46:45.652
Hot? Oh, it'll get much hotter
before it cools off... in winter.

46:45.740 --> 46:48.174
We have snow in winter.

46:48.260 --> 46:52.253
Mr Guthrie used to say
it's either burn or freeze in Pecos.

46:52.340 --> 46:54.774
The late Mr Guthrie.

46:56.500 --> 46:58.491
Are those fresh flowers?

46:59.740 --> 47:02.174
Oh. Yes. They're from my garden.

47:04.980 --> 47:06.936
May I?

47:08.220 --> 47:10.176
Thank you.

47:16.700 --> 47:20.534
- I want to buy a horse, Mr Kenarsie.
- Buy?

47:20.620 --> 47:23.817
Recollect you saying something
about staying off horses.

47:23.900 --> 47:25.458
Until I have to get on one.

47:25.540 --> 47:28.850
Keep it here and saddled up
for the next 24 hours.

47:28.940 --> 47:32.091
I hear you. Knew we could look
for a little action soon.

47:32.180 --> 47:35.536
Well, er... Let's see what we got here. Ah.

47:39.460 --> 47:41.690
Here's a goodie. Yes, sirree.

47:42.940 --> 47:44.896
Here, boy.

47:45.940 --> 47:48.170
There's a steal. $30.

47:52.580 --> 47:56.653
Who is stealing from whom? Four hours'
ride and this horse will go lame.

47:57.980 --> 48:00.972
You got a pretty good feel
for a horse-shy city fella.

48:04.300 --> 48:06.256
Let's see. What else we got here?

48:06.340 --> 48:09.332
You've got nothing here but that.

48:09.420 --> 48:11.376
No. That sorrel ain't for sale.

48:11.460 --> 48:13.769
I nursed him up from a colt.
Ride him myself.

48:13.860 --> 48:15.976
I wouldn't sell him for gold.

48:17.020 --> 48:21.650
- $30 in currency.
- No. I wouldn't sell him.

48:21.740 --> 48:24.698
I can't allow you to cheat yourself,
Mr Kenarsie.

48:24.780 --> 48:27.135
$30 when I take him out.

48:30.340 --> 48:32.296
He's worth 200.

48:32.380 --> 48:34.496
30.

48:34.580 --> 48:38.619
Now saddle him up and keep him saddled.

48:46.140 --> 48:48.893
(Manuel) Matt! Señor Matt!

48:57.940 --> 49:01.649
Cornmeal. Un pollo.

49:02.900 --> 49:04.458
And news.

49:05.860 --> 49:07.418
Gunfighter in town.

49:08.380 --> 49:10.814
He's due, don't worry.

49:10.900 --> 49:14.131
But I do, amigo. I have seen him.

49:14.220 --> 49:17.895
Today he bought a horse
that he will use before tomorrow night.

49:19.460 --> 49:23.373
Yeah, well...
I'm ready and waiting for him.

49:28.540 --> 49:33.170
If you got it to spare, thank you kindly.

49:35.500 --> 49:40.494
But this... You can't spare that.

49:42.300 --> 49:45.212
- I can shoot mine.
- True.

49:45.300 --> 49:48.019
To us they will not sell shot.

50:25.820 --> 50:27.856
Shave, one dime.

50:35.580 --> 50:38.413
I admire your enterprise.

50:38.500 --> 50:42.698
The war shorted me on customers,
in a manner of speaking.

50:42.780 --> 50:46.136
I had to do something
to make ends meet.

50:46.220 --> 50:48.176
Show me that.

50:50.140 --> 50:56.249
I'm showing that on consignment
for one of our local widows.

50:57.580 --> 50:59.650
Husband didn't make it back.

51:00.940 --> 51:03.215
Bargain at $50.

51:04.900 --> 51:09.098
I'll take it.
I'll pay Mrs Guthrie when I see her.

51:09.180 --> 51:13.571
Well, now, I didn't say Mrs...
No, sirree. I don't do business...

51:13.660 --> 51:16.413
You can't...
What am I going to tell Mrs Guthrie?

51:16.500 --> 51:18.456
I'll tell her.

51:20.460 --> 51:24.612
My motto is eliminate the middleman
by hook or crook.

51:58.380 --> 52:01.850
(AII speak rapidly in Spanish)

52:14.340 --> 52:17.969
Señor, a usted le han pagado para que
mate a Matt Weaver.

52:25.980 --> 52:29.609
Señor, you will kill Matt Weaver?

52:29.700 --> 52:31.850
Señor, why does it interest you?

52:33.980 --> 52:39.577
He is the only man here
who treats us like men.

52:39.660 --> 52:41.810
Matt Weaver and his father before him.

52:41.900 --> 52:44.334
The Reb?

52:45.700 --> 52:47.656
People aren't simple, are they?

52:47.740 --> 52:50.573
Yes, I've been hired
to kill Matt Weaver.

52:50.660 --> 52:55.654
Save your breath
and tell them they've been wasting theirs.

52:55.740 --> 52:59.733
If only a man with a gun can solve
their problems, I'm not the man.

52:59.820 --> 53:01.776
I'm not even interested.

53:41.100 --> 53:43.455
(Banging)

54:05.500 --> 54:08.219
You have time to kill me and get away.

54:11.780 --> 54:14.169
Cover up for a thief? I won't do it.

54:15.340 --> 54:17.296
Oh, Matt.

54:20.980 --> 54:24.814
If these bullets keep me alive,
I'll pay you back.

54:26.020 --> 54:29.012
Say what you mean.
Say you're ready to keep on killing.

54:29.100 --> 54:32.615
I told you, Ruth,
I'll fight to keep what's mine.

54:36.660 --> 54:40.255
I'm ready for your gunfighter now,
so you just send him after me.

54:40.340 --> 54:44.299
Is that the way you came in?
Well, leave that way now.

54:45.340 --> 54:49.492
Ruth, I never thanked you for coming out
to warn me. I do thank you, Ruth.

54:50.700 --> 54:52.975
- Hurry, Matt.
- Ruth...

54:53.060 --> 54:55.972
I'm saying goodbye.

54:56.060 --> 54:58.210
Only way I know.

54:59.260 --> 55:01.774
I love you and I'm sorry I'm like I am.

55:05.180 --> 55:07.216
Don't you cover up...

55:22.740 --> 55:25.573
May I join you?

55:28.780 --> 55:31.499
- Who's he?
- I board here.

55:33.300 --> 55:35.734
No, sir. You're the gunfighter.

55:35.820 --> 55:39.256
- A gunfighter without a gun.
- You're taking quite a chance.

55:39.340 --> 55:42.491
I passed up my chance of killing you.

55:42.580 --> 55:46.858
I wanted to look you over, ask a question.

55:46.940 --> 55:51.730
Look quick. I killed so many men these
past four years, one more don't matter.

55:51.820 --> 55:55.290
You passed up your chance.
You think I'm gonna pass up mine?

55:55.380 --> 55:57.530
Truce for tonight.

55:57.620 --> 55:59.975
Then you believe them
when they say I'm crazy?

56:00.060 --> 56:01.812
So am I, but it's a funny thing.

56:01.900 --> 56:04.573
A man crazy to live
takes a chance and dies.

56:04.660 --> 56:08.892
A man who doesn't care takes
the same chance and gets away with it.

56:08.980 --> 56:11.494
Let's call it Jules Gaspard's Law.

56:12.740 --> 56:15.254
All right. All right.

56:15.340 --> 56:19.128
So far you're getting away with it.
Now, about that question.

56:20.300 --> 56:23.178
Why were you the one Reb
in a Union town?

56:24.860 --> 56:26.976
What kind of a question...

56:29.620 --> 56:32.851
Well, I used to have a reason.
Lots of them.

56:32.940 --> 56:35.056
Was it to defend your...

56:35.140 --> 56:37.449
let's call it your slave-owning rights.

56:37.540 --> 56:40.691
Slave-owning rights? Slave-owning?

56:40.780 --> 56:43.248
Whoever seen a slave in these parts?
You, Ruth?

56:43.340 --> 56:45.854
Only my pa and me
slaving away for Brewster.

56:45.940 --> 56:47.976
Paying off loans for seed and stock.

56:48.060 --> 56:51.416
Took longer to pay off the interest
than the loans.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.058
I know.

56:53.140 --> 56:56.974
I know it's a poor, mean excuse
of a reason to carry arms.

56:57.780 --> 56:59.372
Sometimes...

56:59.460 --> 57:02.770
Sometimes it seems like to me
I went Reb just to cross Brewster.

57:02.860 --> 57:04.418
Don't believe him.

57:04.500 --> 57:07.890
He's what he is because
he can't do anything like anybody else,

57:07.980 --> 57:11.689
and because he hates this town
as much as you do.

57:11.780 --> 57:15.455
You both hate this town
and you've let it set you against each other.

57:16.300 --> 57:19.895
You think you've found a way to get me
not to do what I've been paid to do.

57:21.460 --> 57:23.371
Have I?

57:23.460 --> 57:26.577
If I were human. I'm not, I'm told.

57:27.740 --> 57:31.415
You don't want to be. I believe that you are.

57:31.500 --> 57:34.492
I say you're gonna try
to earn your blood money.

57:34.580 --> 57:36.536
Right.

57:36.620 --> 57:39.259
You stand between me
and something I want.

57:39.340 --> 57:43.333
Mm-hm. When the time comes,
it'll help to know you aren't human.

57:43.420 --> 57:44.489
(Crane) Ruth!

57:45.700 --> 57:47.850
Where are you? Ruth!

58:22.940 --> 58:24.692
You stopped me.

58:25.340 --> 58:27.296
Couldn't have you claiming my $500.

58:27.380 --> 58:30.019
- You let him get away.
- My aim was off.

58:30.100 --> 58:32.170
I don't see you hotfooting after him.

58:32.260 --> 58:34.490
I'm tired. Your wife caught him stealing.

58:34.580 --> 58:37.652
I mistakenly came to her rescue
without my gun.

58:37.740 --> 58:40.857
- We'll make a fresh start tomorrow.
- Sure.

58:42.060 --> 58:44.494
Good night.

58:49.500 --> 58:52.412
- You caught him stealing?
- Yes.

58:52.500 --> 58:54.968
- Or arranged it?
- No.

58:55.060 --> 58:58.530
Or maybe set up a truce parley
between him and the gunfighter?

58:58.620 --> 59:00.850
Sober up before you accuse me.

59:02.420 --> 59:05.218
What did you promise the gunfighter
to let Matt go?

59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.456
(Knock on door)

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.812
Oh. I saw Mr Adams.
Then I saw you through the...

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.050
It's early, but I thought you might be...

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.449
- You're not open?
- We just opened.

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:18.453
If Mrs Adams isn't about yet,
I can just come back a little later.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:21.259
What did you have in mind?

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:24.138
Just some thread. So it can wait.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:31.216
Mrs Guthrie, do you know that I am now
the proud possessor of this?

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.216
That isn't why I came here.

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.495
Don't think that's why I came here.

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.048
Are you willing to part with it to me?

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.809
I must part with it...
if you're sure you want it.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.856
I want it.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:49.410
Now, what did Mr Fiddler
say it was worth?

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:54.449
He said...
He thought I might get $25 for it.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:01.772
Now, 50's the price Mr Fiddler quoted
and what it's worth to me.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:05.136
I can't allow you to...

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:10.214
Now, Mrs Guthrie,
don't you think you owe yourself...

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.177
a new dress?

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.814
I haven't had a new dress since...

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.090
Well, it's been a long time.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.170
Silk.

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.216
Or maybe something gay.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.452
I really can't decide.

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.453
I'm afraid of losing all control
with my new-found riches.

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:42.100
I'll have to think it over
and come back later.

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.375
- Thread.
- Yes.

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:46.849
Thread. I do need some thread.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.896
It's white.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.612
- Thank you for opening for me.
- There you are, Ruth.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:57.409
Good morning, Hannah. One spool
of thread. That's 12 cents, please.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:01.379
It's a lovely morning, isn't it? Just lovely.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:09.615
I pray that the watch
will be worth $50 to you.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:14.820
Mrs Guthrie, if one dollar of it
finds its way into Mr Fiddler's pocket,

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.290
I promise you I'll smash the watch.

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.496
Yes. You...

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.456
Here you are.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:31.577
I think I'll buy enough material
to make a bonnet to match.

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:54.613
You don't keep a record
of 12-cent sales?

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.019
What are you?

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.250
You know all you need to know.

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:07.377
A hired killer.
How could you choose such a life?

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:11.169
Choose?
Why did you marry Crane Adams?

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:16.818
Shall I help? You both loved music.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.017
He lost his arm
in the holy war to free the slaves,

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.056
lost music with his arm.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.210
So you made it up to him,

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.689
hating slavery as you do.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.532
If you do.

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.576
Because I've never seen it?

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.616
Can't you hate an idea? I hated it.

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:35.533
- And loved Crane for hating it too?
- Wanted to.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:40.053
You're forgetting
I was born in New Orleans,

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.608
where we see things differently.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:47.899
- Black men are born to be slaves.
- You can't believe that.

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:51.893
- Because all men are born equal?
- They should be.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:55.939
Now, you wanted to know
how I turned gunfighter.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.815
Well, my father educated me

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:04.337
beyond what the New Orleanians
would call my station in life.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:09.058
- I don't understand.
- You don't?

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:12.530
My mother asked my father
to improve my position.

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.293
He refused.

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.132
She kept asking.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.176
It annoyed him.

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.216
So he sold her.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:32.450
You see, we could say
that Crane lost his arm to free me.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.532
To free me for what?

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:37.656
That is the question, Mrs Adams.

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.816
Have you lost your voice?

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.416
Don't look like that.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.418
It's not what you've just told me, it's...

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.855
- It's what it's made of you.
- No.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.330
There was a wide choice
for the son of a quadroon slave.

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.376
Piano player in a fancy house,

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:05.293
back-room gladiator
for white gentlemen betters.

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:10.251
But your name,
that beautiful French name.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.013
Oh, yes. My father's name.

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.136
I'm covering it with glory.

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:17.699
You pity him?

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.292
I pity his son.

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:26.809
Save your pity for Matt Weaver.
He's dying tonight.

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:30.416
Please.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.775
Last night you let him live.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:37.729
Today you're going to kill him
because of something I've said or done?

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.459
There's something I want from you.
It's not pity.

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.776
Leave your husband

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.294
and this hellhole of a town

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.336
with me.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.933
Think about it.

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.049
(Guitar music)

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.489
Will you kill Matt Weaver, señor?

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:15.890
Señor, I am not here to talk.

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:20.094
I am here on very important business.

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.330
Do not kill Matt Weaver.

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.216
I've been paid to kill him,

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.650
I swore to kill him

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.256
and I want to kill him.

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.208
Then why do you drink in the morning?

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.096
Don't worry about the Reb.

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.536
His skin is white.

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:59.653
If the white town finds out they need him,

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.291
they'll find a way of getting to him.

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:05.814
No. Never.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.413
Soon.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.650
If I am wrong,

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:12.459
if he lets himself be used,

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.895
I will load your gun for you.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.019
Stand by, señor. Stand by.

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.013
I guess you didn't hear Crane Adams.

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:27.775
Jewel let Matt Weaver
fly free as a bird last night.

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:29.930
Shot at him and missed.

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.453
Fine gunfighter.

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:36.419
He's a dead shot. He done it on purpose.
He's from New Orleans.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.890
Mr Brewster, he's a Reb, just like Matt.

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:42.574
You all had your say now?

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.178
All right.

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.935
I want to do whatever's right
and best for us all.

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:52.899
Whosoever would be chief among you,
let him be your servant.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:57.297
So, let's hear the will of this meeting.

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:03.850
- Get rid of the gunfighter.
- Now.

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:14.418
So be it.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.569
I'm elected to do the talking, am I?

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:27.412
Then you all bear me witness
I do it right.

01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:52.215
Today we vary your diet.

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:56.696
There.

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.496
God in heaven.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:17.293
- Going to the hotel.
- Yeah.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.689
Going past it now.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.492
Fiddler's locked his door.

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.457
(Laughs)

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:55.609
Like a dog in a garbage heap.

01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.098
Yes. A mad dog.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.898
What's he doing?

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.449
(Laughs)

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.410
Stop him!

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.736
Talk, or I will.

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.376
Jewel...

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:28.696
I'd like to have a word with you.

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.135
Well, here I am.

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:35.176
I...

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.490
I'd like...

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:42.293
a few words in private, Jewel.

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:46.850
- A few words here.
- All right.

01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:49.173
Kneel.

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.493
On your knees, Mr Brewster.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.772
Rooster ruler of the roost.

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.980
Get on your knees.

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:22.578
Repeat after me.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.580
Don't face me, face this miserable animal.

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.895
He's doing it.

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.893
Now... repeat after me.

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:49.020
"I am a thief and a hypocrite

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:52.411
"and I beg forgiveness

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:57.009
"for all the filth
I've burdened you with

01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:00.172
"in this dirtiest of towns

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:03.172
"on the dirty face of the earth."

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.776
Say it.

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:19.932
(Horses approach)

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.896
(Man) Matt!

01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.936
Matt Weaver!

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.893
- Don't move, doc.
- I won't.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:35.292
But Brewster's coming in to parley.
We got trouble, Matt.

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:50.017
Crane's dead. The sheriff's dead drunk.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.012
- Ruth?
- All right last I saw her.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.852
Gunfighter's gone on a rampage.

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:58.057
He smashed up the whole town.
Everybody's hid out.

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.493
What you want?

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:03.289
I'm going to give you the satisfaction
of hearing that from Brewster.

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.336
That much you got coming.

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:11.295
Deed to your farm
signed back to you by Mrs Medford.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.655
She told me
how Medford got himself killed.

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.696
How long you known that?

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:18.340
Let's just call this paper a peace treaty.

01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:21.416
War's over.

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.889
What you want from me
for my own farm?

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.936
Your help.

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.448
Why, don't look so sad
when you make a joke.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.134
- No joke.
- Funniest I ever heard.

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.895
You bribing me to kill a gunfighter
you hired to kill me.

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:45.854
- I'm laughing fit to kill.
- You're right, Matt.

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:48.738
You got no use for me
and I got none for you.

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:51.857
But fair is fair.
I was wrong about Medford.

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:53.692
I was wrong to hire the gunfighter.

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:56.817
I just pray you're a better shot than him.

01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:02.976
You think you can pray me
into being one of your fool hired hands?

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:05.016
The town's full of them.

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:09.298
You can do it and you're gonna do it,
so let's stop talking about it. I know.

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:13.056
You know what?

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:15.334
Ruth.

01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:21.017
Ruth and the gunfighter alone in
the emporium ever since Crane was killed.

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:24.809
And she went back
of her own free will. I saw.

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:30.293
Today Crane stopped fretting about you.
Tried to kill the gunfighter.

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.416
I got a notion how come he tried.

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:37.977
- Go on.
- Oh, Matt.

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:42.292
Now, we all know Ruth's still got
a soft spot in her heart for you.

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:49.411
I got this notion she promised
the gunfighter something... Let you go.

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.416
Crane couldn't stand that.

01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:00.775
He said I stood between him
and something he wanted.

01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:07.618
Well, anyway, they been alone there
together in the emporium this past hour.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.936
We brung a horse for you.

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:30.978
You've changed your mind.

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:37.088
It was changed for me.

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:39.535
Crane's dead. I'm half-dead.

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:42.692
If my going with you
will save one whole life...

01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:46.095
Is that the whole reason?

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:51.136
I wish it were.

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:57.136
But the truth is
part of me wants to come with you.

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.290
And you know that.

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:04.898
I warn you.

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:07.448
It won't keep me alive very long.

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:12.175
You said you never lie,

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:15.411
so I've believed
everything you told me.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.456
You said you'd kill Matt.

01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:20.336
You said you aren't human.

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:26.770
I told you I'd been told that all my life.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:30.136
It didn't have to be true.

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:33.370
But now you've believed it.

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.451
And now it's true.

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:43.455
I give you two lives for the one I took.

01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.854
Yours...

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:49.613
and Matt Weaver's.

01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.736
Because what I feel for you

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.739
might turn out to be the opposite of hate.

01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:10.056
I can't risk that.

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.172
I'm going in.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:27.774
There.

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:56.250
Hombres con pistolas... y Matt Weaver.

01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:58.251
Gracias.

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:11.376
- Looking for me?
- No.

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.329
- You going somewheres?
- Yes.

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.930
Without earning your blood money?

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:24.734
Which reminds me.

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.176
The blood money.

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:34.089
You might use it in my name,

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:37.809
say for the emancipation
of the local slaves...

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:41.255
Reb.

01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:43.900
I'm standing between you
and something you want?

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:47.734
You're standing between me
and the road out of town.

01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:51.859
Well, if it wasn't the money,
what do you want? What did you get?

01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.970
Neither profit nor pleasure.

01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.210
You can't make me draw on you.

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:05.216
Stop trying, boy.

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:11.136
Matt!

01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:13.176
Let him go.

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.692
Why is he going?

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:21.854
What did you give him to let me off?

01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.698
Nothing.

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:31.499
Not true.

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:33.937
Cuidado!

01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.453
Oh, God.

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:56.855
(Jewel) Brewster.

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:02.735
Throw the gun.

01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:11.938
Get on your knees.

01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:21.974
This time say it.

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:24.369
Don't face me.

01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:26.530
Face this mule of a Reb.

01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:40.770
Say after me...

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:44.970
"I am a thief

01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:47.369
"and a liar."

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:50.655
I am a thief

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:53.174
and a liar.

01:25:53.260 --> 01:26:00.689
Say, "Forgive me
for betraying you and this town,

01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.651
"this town that I now...

01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.611
"bequeath to your care."

01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:23.736
Say it.

01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:37.976
Say it.

01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.373
We did it.

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:50.451
No, you did it, Brewster.

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:54.450
You turned me into one of them.

01:26:57.260 --> 01:26:58.932
Now finish it.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:01.978
