WEBVTT

00:42.959 --> 00:44.586
I fucked up, Marta.

00:49.507 --> 00:52.135
I fucked up really bad. I killed that boy.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.473
I can't stop thinking about it.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.644
Just clear your mind.

01:16.993 --> 01:21.081
Do you know
how fucking extraordinary you are?

01:21.081 --> 01:23.833
None of these assholes appreciate you.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.628
Not Rafa, none of them.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.765
Of course my cousin's not happy.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.852
And Rafa wants him to have you killed.

01:43.478 --> 01:46.189
But don't pay any attention to that.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.359
Marta, listen.

01:49.359 --> 01:54.906
Maybe you can talk to them for me?

01:54.906 --> 01:57.408
Tell Fabio that you're sorry?

01:57.408 --> 02:00.161
Okay, what should I say?

02:00.161 --> 02:01.788
I know.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.082
I'll tell him that you're sorry

02:04.082 --> 02:06.417
and it will never happen again.

02:06.417 --> 02:09.295
Should I tell him?

02:09.295 --> 02:13.383
Yes. And you're also going to tell him

02:14.509 --> 02:18.346
that I'm better
than all those gringo motherfuckers.

02:18.346 --> 02:22.308
That I'm the only one
that knows how to get the job done.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.103
I don't know.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.355
I don't know.

02:28.356 --> 02:31.067
I'll make you my partner.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.987
Holy fuck!

02:33.987 --> 02:38.449
Partners?! Are you serious?

02:38.449 --> 02:41.870
We'll be like Greek goddesses of coke.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.539
Greek fucking goddesses of coke!

02:44.539 --> 02:45.748
Marta Ochoa.

02:45.748 --> 02:49.169
And Griselda Blanco! Holy fuck.

02:49.752 --> 02:53.172
Go tell all those assholes.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.968
Tell them who's running things now.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.556
Listen up, motherfuckers.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.599
That's it.

03:02.599 --> 03:06.060
Know that in this town,
the ones in charge...

03:06.060 --> 03:07.186
Louder!

03:09.689 --> 03:11.107
...are us!

03:14.986 --> 03:16.404
Everything is going to be fine.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.742
And everything will go back to normal.

03:26.247 --> 03:33.171
Marta!

03:34.797 --> 03:35.632
Marta!

03:46.100 --> 03:47.852
- What happened?
- Follow me.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.107
What the fuck?

03:55.026 --> 03:56.027
What happened?

03:56.527 --> 03:57.528
I don't know.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.863
It was an accident.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.823
An overdose.

04:00.823 --> 04:03.952
Fabio and Rafa may not see it that way.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.536
I'll just explain it to them.

04:05.536 --> 04:07.747
No! It may be more complicated than that.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.627
After the party,
all the shit that went down,

04:12.627 --> 04:15.546
I had one of my guys follow Carmen,
and you know what?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.383
She went directly to CENTAC.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.636
- CENTAC?
- Yes.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.222
After everything I did for her.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.057
Well, you did try to kill her.

04:26.766 --> 04:31.396
Cops hit the bank, paper trail led them
to the other stash houses. Understand?

04:33.648 --> 04:34.857
All my money.

04:34.857 --> 04:35.858
Yes, your money.

04:36.818 --> 04:40.113
Chucho's son, Marta, Carmen.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.369
You're done with the Ochoas, Griselda.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.417
Did you hear me?

04:55.753 --> 04:57.463
Motherfucker!

04:57.463 --> 04:59.924
- Everything I've worked for, it's gone!
- Griselda.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.801
Lost everything 'cause of this bitch.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.553
Stop! Listen to me.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.764
Nothing's ever over.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.186
There's always something new.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.565
Understand?

05:20.611 --> 05:21.654
Rivi.

05:23.072 --> 05:27.160
Let's dump the body and make them think
she and I skipped town together.

05:28.119 --> 05:32.373
Let's leave Miami.
Help me clean this shit up.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.385
Rivi, come see this!

05:55.271 --> 05:56.856
Beautiful.

05:58.316 --> 06:02.528
The bitch was always complaining
she didn't have enough coke.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.530
Rich people.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.701
I think the universe
is telling you something.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.499
What if we take the coke with her body?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.543
Rafa'll think Marta ran off with it.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.802
- Are these the last ones?
- Yes.

06:25.802 --> 06:29.430
I'll bring the car closer so we can place
the body in there. Wait for me here.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.475
Someone's here.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.770
Fuck, my car.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.031
Come on.

07:03.464 --> 07:06.425
Marta, I brought you McDonald's.

07:30.783 --> 07:31.617
Marta!

07:36.956 --> 07:39.000
He's gone. Let's go.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.306
- What's going on?
- We have to leave, now.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.142
Now what? You did something else?

07:57.852 --> 07:59.812
Listen. I'm in trouble.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.356
People are after me.
But I have a lot of product.

08:02.356 --> 08:05.151
We can go to another city
and start from scratch.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.820
Name one where the cartel won't find us.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.494
Hello?

08:15.870 --> 08:17.705
- Dario?
- Now, give it to me.

08:19.081 --> 08:19.957
Go.

08:20.875 --> 08:21.918
Where the fuck are you?

08:21.918 --> 08:24.295
- We have to get out of here.
<i>- Griselda.</i>

08:24.295 --> 08:26.589
Carmen talked to CENTAC
and the Ochoas are after me--

08:26.589 --> 08:29.926
<i>Griselda. I don't care
what's happened. I'm not coming.</i>

08:30.551 --> 08:31.636
What are you talking about?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.846
You forgot what you said
to me at the party?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.891
I was high.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.935
I've given this a lot of thought.

08:40.228 --> 08:43.105
I can't keep doing this anymore, Griselda.

08:43.898 --> 08:44.732
<i>It's over.</i>

08:45.858 --> 08:46.901
What do you mean?

08:53.866 --> 08:55.201
No, Dario.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.416
- Where's Michael?
- He's safe.

09:02.416 --> 09:05.503
- He's with me.
<i>- Where are you taking him?</i>

09:05.503 --> 09:07.171
You know I'm not telling you that.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.882
Listen, Dario.
You bring Michael here right now.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.176
If not, I'm going to hunt you down

09:12.176 --> 09:14.804
and rip off
that pretty little face of yours.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.764
Do you hear yourself?

09:16.764 --> 09:19.892
That's exactly why I left Miami
and I'm never coming the fuck back.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.811
Listen, you worthless piece of shit!

09:21.811 --> 09:25.189
You were nothing before I met you,
a fucking bodyguard!

09:25.189 --> 09:28.818
I gave you money, I gave you a son,
and now you're taking him away from me?!

09:29.318 --> 09:31.404
No. I'm saving him from you.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.116
Come on, son.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.330
Motherfucker!

09:48.629 --> 09:49.589
Ready?

11:30.564 --> 11:31.607
Rafa.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.610
Anything?

11:35.569 --> 11:36.946
They took all their shit.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.407
Probably left town.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.244
I would if I killed an Ochoa.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.832
Did you see how they left her?

11:50.084 --> 11:54.630
I found her in the fucking jacuzzi
boiling like a piece of meat.

11:55.881 --> 12:00.136
Fucking waste.
With so much life in front of her.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.059
That bitch's gonna sell that coke,

12:07.059 --> 12:10.187
and I wanna know
the second it hits the street.

12:12.606 --> 12:13.482
Hiram.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.989
There's a million dollars
for whoever tells me first.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.535
Come on.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.283
You okay?

13:06.243 --> 13:08.454
I just asked you to teach him a lesson.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.417
And you kill his kid?

13:13.417 --> 13:17.254
It was an accident.
I sent Rivi to scare him, and--

13:17.254 --> 13:19.048
What the fuck is wrong with you?

13:21.467 --> 13:22.593
Uber was right.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.929
You're a liar.

13:37.816 --> 13:42.780
Rivi's going to sell the coke here,
in stages, so we don't alert the Ochoas.

13:43.781 --> 13:47.201
Then we'll have enough money
to go live somewhere nobody can find us.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.620
Not the cops. Not the Ochoas. No one.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.997
What about Dario and Michael?

13:54.750 --> 13:57.545
I have an idea where they are.

13:58.546 --> 14:05.302
I'm going to do my best to convince them
to join us, but if they can't, so be it.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.640
Dixon.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.852
You're right.

14:13.852 --> 14:17.147
I haven't always been honest with you.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.235
But I want to change that right now.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.531
There's something I meant to give you

14:27.116 --> 14:28.742
after Dario's party, but...

14:31.787 --> 14:33.664
I had these made from my necklace.

14:34.498 --> 14:38.210
So we can each wear one and feel close.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.296
Ozzy.

14:49.847 --> 14:50.890
Dixon.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.641
Uber.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.978
I have one too.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.564
And one for Michael.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.066
Thank you, Mom.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.507
<i>Carolina.</i>

16:07.257 --> 16:08.175
<i>It's Griselda.</i>

16:09.510 --> 16:10.928
Can I please speak with Dario?

16:11.762 --> 16:14.640
I told you, Griselda. Dario's not here.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.101
<i>I know he's there.</i>

16:19.770 --> 16:22.439
Please tell Michael I love him.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.483
Please, stop calling.

16:34.868 --> 16:35.786
You okay?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.664
Dario doesn't want to talk to me.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.340
This will make you feel better.

16:53.721 --> 16:54.972
I sold the first batch.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.058
I have a plan.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.034
Son of a bitch.

17:20.622 --> 17:21.623
Rafa.

17:24.168 --> 17:25.127
You okay?

17:32.384 --> 17:34.219
What do you want?

17:34.219 --> 17:37.473
Got word she sold
some of the coke out in Los Angeles.

17:41.810 --> 17:42.686
Los Angeles?

17:42.686 --> 17:45.314
Yes, sir. She's in a motel in Long Beach.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.902
Then let's go to fucking Los Angeles.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.279
Let's go to Los Angeles.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.436
<i>- Hello.</i>
- It's me.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.564
<i>Rafa is in LA.
He's on his way to the motel.</i>

18:27.564 --> 18:29.233
<i>You better fucking move.</i>

19:27.541 --> 19:28.792
Keep playing.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.928
- Hello?
- Griselda, Rafa's on his way there.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.183
Okay.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.852
You know what to do.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.353
<i>Wait.</i>

19:48.353 --> 19:51.398
I know the boys are there, so just listen.

19:52.649 --> 19:58.405
I have this feeling that
in a past life, you and I were lovers.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.328
Goodbye, Rivi.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.412
Goodbye...

20:07.331 --> 20:08.498
Griselda Blanco.

20:30.062 --> 20:30.896
That was Rivi.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.567
He wants us to meet him
for dinner, but I'm tired.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.569
Why don't you take a cab?

20:46.662 --> 20:47.829
You don't want to come?

20:48.872 --> 20:51.083
No, I want to try Dario again,

20:52.125 --> 20:53.710
he might pick up.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.298
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.425
- Bye.
- Come here.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.108
Are we almost at the motel?

21:16.692 --> 21:17.776
Yes, sir.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.716
Bitch called the cops on herself.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.312
Fuck!

24:37.684 --> 24:38.810
WE'LL BE WAITING...

24:38.810 --> 24:40.312
WITH LOVE,
YOUR CHILDREN

26:48.231 --> 26:50.817
Uber. Stir this for me.
I gotta go make a call.

26:50.817 --> 26:53.945
I thought we weren't calling anyone.

26:54.696 --> 26:57.073
We aren't calling our fucking girlfriends.

26:59.701 --> 27:00.952
You hear me?

27:03.163 --> 27:04.372
This is business.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.013
So what?

27:20.013 --> 27:22.891
Now we go from motel
to motel with that psycho?

27:23.808 --> 27:25.268
Gotta stick to the plan.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.190
Well, I can't eat any more of this shit.

27:36.571 --> 27:38.281
They got nothing real on Mom.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.533
That is the point.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.994
This is how we keep it that way.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.914
<i>- We interrupt this program to bring you--</i>
- Hey.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.624
Look. That's me.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.209
Griselda.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.128
- My boys.
- They're fine.

29:57.128 --> 30:01.382
On their way to Chicago
with everything they need.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.303
Thought we were lovers in a past life.

30:05.303 --> 30:08.556
Doesn't mean
I'm dying for you in this one.

36:52.376 --> 36:53.544
<i>"You're welcome."</i>

37:51.519 --> 37:52.979
Here you go.

37:57.900 --> 37:58.818
I'll go.

38:01.362 --> 38:02.822
Don't play with your food.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.446
Dad!

38:47.241 --> 38:48.451
Dario!

38:49.243 --> 38:51.746
They took Michael! Dario!

38:51.746 --> 38:55.082
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

39:29.241 --> 39:30.993
My boys.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.995
How are you, Mom?

39:33.871 --> 39:34.872
So much better now.

39:35.623 --> 39:38.334
We have a surprise for you.

39:39.752 --> 39:41.253
Say hello.

39:43.005 --> 39:45.091
- Hi, Mommy.
- My baby.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.219
I missed you so much.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.638
One of Dario's friends
brought him from Colombia.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.015
Dario had to go somewhere for work.

39:54.308 --> 39:57.353
He couldn't take care of him anymore.
He wanted him to be with us.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.357
I'm so happy.

40:02.316 --> 40:05.152
When I'm out, we'll all be a family again.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.285
Tell Mommy you miss her.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.496
I miss you, Mommy.

44:38.550 --> 44:39.760
<i>Mom.</i>
