WEBVTT

00:04.463 --> 00:06.010
I'm Sheriff Donna Hanscum.

00:06.215 --> 00:08.513
My husband, Doug, left me last year,

00:08.759 --> 00:11.888
'cause he said I loved
cookie-dough milkshakes more than him.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.096
You deserve better.

00:13.305 --> 00:14.557
- Donna.
- Doug.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.646
Well, aren't you looking good, huh?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.231
I lost six pounds.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.528
Hey! You're a quarter of the way there.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.239
Doug seems like kind of a dick.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.288
You ever think
there are things out there,

00:24.483 --> 00:26.781
things that
don't end up on the police blotter?

00:26.985 --> 00:30.364
What I think I saw were teeth.
You think I'm crazy?

00:30.614 --> 00:31.615
Not at all.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.373
- She just pulled out a machete...
- Sheriff Cuse is a vampire.

00:35.661 --> 00:36.662
Donna saw his teeth.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.002
What the cuss? A vampire?

00:42.960 --> 00:45.133
They can't hurt you. They can't hurt you.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.051
â€œIf it bleeds, you can kill it."

00:47.422 --> 00:49.766
This isn't about your clown thing, is it?

00:50.133 --> 00:51.259
What? No.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.478
What in the world
did they do to you?

00:59.977 --> 01:01.729
I think I've been having visions.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.732
I mean, it's just images.
I mean, more of a feeling, really.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.818
I mean, maybe these visions
are coming from God.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.111
Whoa.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.742
I mean, Dean,
the first one happened after I prayed.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.323
You prayed? When was this?

01:13.991 --> 01:15.163
Back in the hospital.

01:15.659 --> 01:16.831
What did you pray about?

01:17.452 --> 01:19.372
I guess I was just looking for answers,
you know?

01:19.413 --> 01:22.007
When was the last time God answered
any one of our prayers?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.719
This is their second drive in overtime,

01:29.881 --> 01:32.054
with both teams having possessed the ball.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.810
The next score wins...

01:35.095 --> 01:36.096
Ah!

01:40.267 --> 01:44.022
Stan! Can you take out the trash?

01:46.398 --> 01:47.866
It stinks to high heaven!

01:48.066 --> 01:49.739
It's your cooking that stinks.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.704
What was that, honey?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.072
Nothing, dear.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.289
Game's in OT. Can't it wait?

02:05.626 --> 02:06.627
Ah...

02:41.745 --> 02:44.248
Hey, hon? Bring me another brewski.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.468
Hey, thanks, babe.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.434
Don't need any possum traps, huh?

03:23.453 --> 03:26.627
So, uh, on the off chance
that you're actually listening, uh,

03:28.458 --> 03:29.630
I gotta be real honest.

03:29.793 --> 03:33.093
The visions aren't making
a whole lot of sense to me.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.595
Truth is,

03:36.925 --> 03:39.223
I don't know what's what.

03:40.846 --> 03:41.847
Please...

03:45.100 --> 03:46.602
What are you trying to say?

03:49.521 --> 03:52.240
Really? I mean, really?

03:52.858 --> 03:55.987
- Ever hear of privacy?
- Hey, you want privacy, close your door.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.240
I thought we talked about this?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.159
Yeah, we did, Dean.
But why is it so hard to believe

04:02.325 --> 04:04.293
that God could be sending me visions
about The Darkness?

04:04.453 --> 04:05.454
Are you kidding me?

04:05.620 --> 04:07.088
He didn't feel the need to show up
for the Apocalypse.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.407
Why would he give a crap now?

04:08.415 --> 04:10.838
I don't know,
maybe because she's his sister.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.161
What do you wanna do?
Sit back, ignore him, do nothing?

04:13.170 --> 04:15.389
No, that's not what I'm sayin'.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.971
I'm saying don't count on God. Okay.
Count on us.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.221
Right.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.399
Well, this is everything Cass
dug up in Gaza.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.731
Every last bit of pre-biblical lore.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.196
Half of it, I couldn't read.
It's in Aramaic.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.355
And the other half...

04:34.357 --> 04:36.610
Not a single
mention of The Darkness, so...

04:37.360 --> 04:39.033
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Huh.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.081
Donna. What's shakin'?

04:43.366 --> 04:44.618
Fat Sucker Donna?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.542
What do you mean, "killer bunny?"

05:16.566 --> 05:18.034
Sheriff. Hey.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.580
You two are a sight for sore eyes!

05:23.198 --> 05:26.327
You working all 10,000 lakes now?
This isn't usually your beat.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.582
Just Larsen County.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.416
What with the cutbacks and all...

05:29.704 --> 05:33.049
For the most part, been tater tots
and lemon drops except for this doozy.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.379
I mean, when you get a call
about a killer Easter Bunny,

05:36.545 --> 05:37.705
you don't know what to think.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.138
Well, you think crazy.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.636
Guy's real strong, too.
Lashed out at several officers.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.184
Took a whole team
just to get him into custody.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.189
But that's not the weirdest part.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.817
Bunny head won't come off.

05:51.977 --> 05:52.978
What do you mean?

05:53.228 --> 05:55.230
Tried everything short of a chainsaw.

05:56.439 --> 05:57.656
But it's really stuck.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.530
Who knows? Could be nothing.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.741
Guy could just have a big melon
like my Uncle Wally.

06:04.281 --> 06:07.034
But ever since I've seen
what goes bump in the night,

06:07.617 --> 06:09.244
I'm not taking any chances.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.751
Hey, you did the right thing. For sure.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.675
Maybe. I'm just still not 100% sure
this is our kind of a case.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.712
But if you got a wild hare...

06:22.799 --> 06:23.800
See what I did there?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.516
It's good to see you two.

06:27.804 --> 06:28.976
Who you got there, Sheriff?

06:29.556 --> 06:32.605
Gentlemen, this is Officer Stover.
He's lead on the case.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.062
Agents Elliott and Savage.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.031
Nice to meet you.
And please, call me "Doug."

06:41.067 --> 06:43.320
These two fine fellas will be
helping outwith the old hippity hop...

06:43.612 --> 06:45.489
Oh. We're gonna need it.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.204
And not that Sheriff Hanscum
isn't doing a bang-up job.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.338
We're lucky to have her.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.389
Well, I better get back to it.

07:05.717 --> 07:06.718
Uh-huh.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.678
What?

07:09.054 --> 07:10.055
Hey, it's none of our business,

07:10.221 --> 07:12.144
but looks like
somebody might have a crush.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.398
I was born at night, Dean. Not last night.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.026
Then what's the deal? He seems nice.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.816
He is. But he's a cop...

07:21.441 --> 07:22.442
Named Doug.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.534
I mean, clearly, I have a type,
but no thank you, ma'am.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.499
Won't be once bitten, twice Doug'd.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.802
All right, where's the wascally wabbit?

07:52.764 --> 07:53.765
Any witnesses?

07:53.974 --> 07:56.944
Yeah, vic's wife, Fran Hinkle.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.275
Poor thing thought she was next,

07:59.437 --> 08:01.986
but the bunny just up
and walked out the door.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.618
- You ID him yet?
- Nope.

08:04.776 --> 08:09.156
No wallet, no cell,
ran his prints, but no prior record.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.286
Couldn't even get our hands
on him long enough

08:11.449 --> 08:13.543
to check for any identifying marks.

08:14.035 --> 08:18.916
Only thing we do know is he's Caucasian,
roughly 18 to 25.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.960
And terrifying.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.259
Clive's on the line.
Said it's an emergency.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.968
Just shoot a hoot if you need me.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.979
- You need anything? Crullers?
- Not right now.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.936
What's up, Doc?

08:43.106 --> 08:45.780
Be easier all around
if you just talk to us.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.622
- Careful.
- Yeah.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.039
So, what happened, pal? Hmm?

08:56.202 --> 08:57.749
What, you drop too much Molly?

08:57.996 --> 09:02.001
Super-glue your mask to your head,
get paranoid, stab a guy?

09:02.584 --> 09:03.676
I've been there.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.675
Let me guess, Rog.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.299
You were framed.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.635
What?

09:13.636 --> 09:14.637
Dean!

09:17.223 --> 09:18.816
I got it. I got it.

09:25.815 --> 09:26.816
Not a demon.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.068
He is strong.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.448
- All right.
- Whoo.

09:45.168 --> 09:48.342
"Kylie forever." That'll work.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.724
Better be her. Last Kylie on the list.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.024
Excuse me. Kylie Jennings?

10:04.646 --> 10:05.647
Yes?

10:05.980 --> 10:07.357
You know this rabbit?

10:09.150 --> 10:10.697
- You found him?
- Who is he?

10:11.402 --> 10:13.575
Mike Hooks. He's my boyfriend.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.118
Okay. Well, do you have any idea why
your boyfriend would stab somebody?

10:17.867 --> 10:18.868
Wait, what?

10:19.285 --> 10:20.662
How would Mike know Stan Hinkle?

10:21.037 --> 10:22.038
Who?

10:22.247 --> 10:23.248
The victim.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.504
Okay, hold on. This makes no sense.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.627
Why would Mike stab a complete stranger?
I mean...

10:30.713 --> 10:32.932
- Oh, God.
- What.

10:33.716 --> 10:37.016
I don't know, I thought it was nothing,
but he was acting really weird yesterday.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.471
Weird, how?

10:39.055 --> 10:41.228
Well, after class,
we went to this thrift shop.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.894
We needed to buy costumes
for a party off campus

10:44.269 --> 10:46.237
and Mike found
this super creepy bunny mask.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.739
I mean, it grossed me out,

10:47.897 --> 10:50.571
which he just loved,
but as soon as he put it on...

10:51.025 --> 10:52.277
That's when the weird started?

10:52.861 --> 10:55.614
Yeah. He just stared at me.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.332
At first, I thought
that he was just messing around,

10:58.491 --> 10:59.743
but then he walked out without paying.

10:59.909 --> 11:03.254
He left his cell at the register, so
I had no way of reaching him and...

11:06.875 --> 11:09.253
Look, Mike's, like, the sweetest, okay?

11:09.586 --> 11:11.626
But I'm telling you,
as soon as he put that mask on,

11:12.130 --> 11:14.679
it's like
he was a completely different person.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.093
Oh, God.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.100
Really think the hospital
can get this puppy off?

11:23.725 --> 11:25.477
Two words, bone saw.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.439
What?

11:29.772 --> 11:31.945
Lady cops can't handle the heavy lifting?

11:33.109 --> 11:34.110
I didn't mean that...

11:35.111 --> 11:38.115
I just figured...
We shot him full of tranquilizers.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.125
Dead weight.
I didn't want you to hurt yourself.

11:42.410 --> 11:46.085
Hurt myself? I do CrossFit.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.465
Just gotta engage the core
and lift with the knees.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.470
Watch and learn.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.141
A little help would be nice.

12:11.773 --> 12:12.990
Okay. Yeah.

12:14.984 --> 12:15.985
Yeah. Hold up.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.531
Those FBI boys.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.449
Hiya, Dean.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.372
Whoa.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.584
You Okay?

13:14.669 --> 13:15.761
No, not really.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.719
A 19-year-old kid is dead.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.602
That's not on you. Or Doug.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.063
He was just doing his job.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.311
I know, but that kid was innocent.

13:36.316 --> 13:41.743
I mean, if the mask was cursed,
then he was just a puppet, right?

13:46.034 --> 13:47.331
He was a victim, too.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.877
No one else dies.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.626
Not like this.

14:32.455 --> 14:36.631
Come on. That's good. Now, one more.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.343
Good.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.635
Nice job, Buckner.
All your hard work's gonna pay off.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.429
- You think so, Coach?
- I know so.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.018
Any scout would be a damn fool
not to snatch you up.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.313
Just lay off the HGH.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.728
You might have to pee in a cup.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.825
I'll be next door,
if you need another spot.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.341
Need another spot?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.038
Good news, Coach is still alive.

16:29.572 --> 16:33.167
Bad news, he's in a coma.
So, we're not out of the woods yet.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.453
Two masked psychos in two days?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.623
I mean, what are the chances?

16:43.961 --> 16:46.089
My guess? Copycat killer.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.261
Damn social media.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.098
Oh. Okay.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.682
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.402
Did you guys talk to the kid yet?

17:00.102 --> 17:01.103
Be my guest.

17:04.607 --> 17:05.608
Hi.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.316
Agents Elliott and Savage.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.569
Brock Buckner.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.787
Well, um, Brock. What did you see?

17:13.991 --> 17:14.992
Not much, man.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.163
I mean, I was just hammering my bis,
getting all swole,

17:18.579 --> 17:21.539
and next thing I know, Coach Evans is
gettin' his ass kicked by the mascot.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.713
And who is the mascot?

17:23.166 --> 17:25.589
Why would I know? I'm the quarterback.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.928
Besides, his mask wouldn't come off.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.601
Couldn't believe
how strong he was, either.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.305
I mean, for a scrawny dude,
he's as strong as me.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.332
And I hold the state bench record.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.982
Oh, yeah? What do you bench?

17:39.559 --> 17:40.560
Four plates.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.520
On each side.

17:43.646 --> 17:44.647
That's...

17:45.523 --> 17:48.493
Okay. So, other than
the mask not coming off

17:48.651 --> 17:51.996
and the Jester hulking out,
did you notice anything else unusual?

17:52.196 --> 17:53.197
What do you mean?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.662
Power surges? Temperature fluctuations?

17:56.701 --> 17:58.578
The weight room did get really cold.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.456
Thanks.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.502
Hmm.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.347
Well. Ain't a cursed object.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.216
Ghost possession.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.302
Oh, for geez! Ghosts can possess people?

18:14.468 --> 18:16.186
Yeah, so, Ghosts 101.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.139
Somebody's spirit
can attach itself to an object,

18:18.306 --> 18:19.728
or a bunch of objects left behind.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.227
In this case, masks.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.647
- Right. So whoever possesses the object...
- Gets possessed.

18:26.814 --> 18:30.364
But if we can't get the masks off,
how the heck do you unpossess someone?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.699
Everything has a weakness. Even ghosts.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.827
They hate iron and salt.

18:35.406 --> 18:38.159
So, all we gotta do is
spook the spook with a little salt,

18:38.326 --> 18:40.124
and maybe we could pry it off.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.174
My diet secret.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.469
One bite of dessert
and then I dump salt on it.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.633
Kills the craving.

18:53.883 --> 18:54.884
And that works?

18:55.051 --> 18:59.397
You betcha.
On everything except salted caramel.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.224
Well, that's cute.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.860
But I was thinking something
a little bit of more like this.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.467
You said no one else was dying.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.651
Salt pellets.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.299
What's going on?

19:35.341 --> 19:37.021
Poor thing doesn't deserve
to be locked up.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.102
So, let her go.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.393
No one saw her face, right?

19:41.972 --> 19:44.942
Yeah, he was a drifter,
overpowered you, escaped.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.521
Well, there's some
female empowerment for ya.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.326
Don't worry, hon.
Just gonna ask you a few questions,

19:59.198 --> 20:00.199
then you're free to go.

20:00.616 --> 20:01.617
I am?

20:01.992 --> 20:02.993
Scout's honor.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.413
You remember attacking Coach Evans?

20:05.579 --> 20:09.254
No, I swear.
I went to pick up the new mascot costume.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.840
Went to try it on
and the next thing I know,

20:12.336 --> 20:13.337
I'm in jail.

20:13.921 --> 20:14.968
Did you even know him?

20:15.381 --> 20:17.179
He was my PE coach last semester.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.692
I mean, he was kind of a hardass, but...

20:21.887 --> 20:23.527
That doesn't mean that I wanted him dead.

20:23.806 --> 20:27.310
Michelle, where did you get the costume?
Was it a thrift store?

20:27.852 --> 20:30.105
No. Someone donated it to the school.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.731
Do you know who?

20:33.065 --> 20:35.614
- Rita Johnson?
- Yeah. Who's asking?

20:36.152 --> 20:38.433
Got a few questions
we wanna ask you about a case in town.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.572
Who is it, Mom?

20:40.322 --> 20:42.165
Um, Max, why don't you go back
and finish your homework.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.371
Why are the police here?

20:45.536 --> 20:47.834
Hey there, fella.
You ever see a real cop car?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.166
I mean, if it's okay with your mom.

20:50.666 --> 20:51.667
Yeah.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.252
Yeah.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.721
- You can talk in the police radio.
- Really?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.757
- It's pretty simple figure out.
- Cool.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.258
Mind if we come inside?

21:00.593 --> 21:01.594
Yeah.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.011
The costumes belonged
to my brother, Chester.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.857
He was a kids' party performer
before he passed.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.142
Oh.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.686
And how did Chester die?

21:13.522 --> 21:15.240
Uh, my brother suffered from depression.

21:16.025 --> 21:19.279
He took his own life a couple months back.
Jumped off a bridge.

21:20.905 --> 21:21.906
Sorry to hear that.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.709
Max begged me to keep the costumes.
He loved them.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.377
He loved his uncle.
I mean, he lived with us.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.584
So, they were really close.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.457
But they made me sad.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.468
So, I donated them
to the local high school,

21:34.919 --> 21:36.045
the theater company.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.421
Thrift shop?

21:37.880 --> 21:38.881
Yeah. Places like that.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.385
Can I ask where Chester's buried?

21:44.261 --> 21:45.683
He's not. He was cremated.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.392
Would you mind making
a list of his costumes?

21:50.559 --> 21:51.679
As many as you can remember?

21:52.895 --> 21:56.069
Sure. But what does
this have to do with your case?

21:57.107 --> 21:58.667
That's what we're trying to figure out.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.236
One more question.

22:00.402 --> 22:04.248
Did Chester have a falling out
with Stan Hinkle or Phil Evans?

22:04.698 --> 22:06.325
Um, or anyone for that matter?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.160
What do you mean?

22:09.703 --> 22:13.674
Did he, urn, did he have any
unfinished business with anyone?

22:14.458 --> 22:17.086
No. Not that I can think of.
I mean, I don't even...

22:17.503 --> 22:19.346
I don't think
Chester even knew those guys.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.098
I remember Chester's suicide. Real sad.

22:26.637 --> 22:29.311
So, now that we know he's the ghost,
how do we stop him?

22:29.765 --> 22:32.314
Well, usually, you gotta burn their bones.
But he was cremated.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.573
So, we're up poop's creek
without a paddle?

22:34.603 --> 22:35.980
Not exactly.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.568
I mean, it looks like
he's tied to the costumes,

22:37.731 --> 22:40.075
which means the only way to stop him
is to burn them.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.839
Then we're already ahead of the game.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.308
I had Doug go to the high school
and collect the costumes.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.322
Great.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.492
Here is the list of the rest.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.952
Think you and Doug can round 'em up?

22:51.370 --> 22:52.872
Yeah. You betcha.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.046
All right, we just gotta figure out
what Chester's beef was with the vics.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.633
Ghosts come back for something personal.
Usually it's revenge.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.482
All right. Drop me off at the hospital.
I'll check on the coach.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.059
I'll see if I can find Stan's widow.
Let's go.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.155
Who the hell are you?

25:35.117 --> 25:36.915
You get a story out of Bozo?

25:37.286 --> 25:39.414
Yeah, name's Steve Buress.

25:39.580 --> 25:42.550
Sixty years old. Retired GP.
Apparently, he was playing dress up

25:42.708 --> 25:45.461
with his grandson,
and the next thing he knew...

25:46.712 --> 25:48.472
Doesn't even know
how he got to the hospital.

25:49.465 --> 25:50.591
He escape, too?

25:52.676 --> 25:53.677
Yeah.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.971
I'm so losing my job.

25:58.599 --> 26:01.068
I was on my way to Woodbury
to pick up a Woodpecker costume.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.149
And I got the call about the coach.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.489
Yeah. This time...

26:07.649 --> 26:08.650
Killer Clown.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.787
Already put out an APB.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.492
What the heck is going on
in this doggone town?

26:17.076 --> 26:19.795
Told you. Copycat killers.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.879
So, this is a copycat of a copycat?

26:25.167 --> 26:28.296
Come on, Doug. It's not that hard
to wrap your noggin around, is it?

26:33.092 --> 26:34.132
Whatever you say, Sheriff.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.974
I'm gonna go get the Woodpecker.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.100
What's the deal?
Why don't you cut the guy a break?

26:43.185 --> 26:45.425
I mean, I wouldn't be buying
what you're sellin', either.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.736
I don't have time for insubordination.

26:48.524 --> 26:52.199
Or is it maybe that you're treating
New Doug like Old Doug

26:52.361 --> 26:53.783
and not even giving him a chance?

26:56.490 --> 26:57.491
You know what I think?

26:59.868 --> 27:03.372
You need to mind your own beeswax.
We have a case to solve.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.049
Phil and Stan were college roommates.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.602
Knew each other since they were 18.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.646
They were like brothers.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.308
In all those years of friendship,

27:22.474 --> 27:27.401
did your husband or the coach ever
know a guy by the name of Chester Johnson?

27:27.563 --> 27:29.236
He was a children's performer.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.451
Yeah, they knew...

27:34.403 --> 27:35.905
Ugh. I can't even say his name.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.160
He makes me sick.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.664
I know you shouldn't
speak ill of the dead,

27:41.827 --> 27:44.501
but I have nothing nice to say
about that man.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.252
Killer clown? You're serious.

27:49.751 --> 27:50.877
No, Dean, I'm joking.

27:51.253 --> 27:52.926
Because clowns are really funny to me.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.178
- Did you take care of it?
- Yeah.

27:55.799 --> 27:56.846
What about you? Anything?

27:57.176 --> 28:00.350
Yeah, turns out Stan and the coach
were besties from way back

28:00.596 --> 28:03.440
who accused Chester
of crossing the line with their kids.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.601
Oh, well...

28:05.934 --> 28:07.982
Yeah. But they didn't
wanna go to the cops

28:08.145 --> 28:09.271
'cause they didn't wanna
embarrass their kids.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.782
So, they decided
to track down Chester themselves.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.660
They went to his house
and got Rita instead.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.784
So, she lied?

28:14.985 --> 28:16.953
- Chester did know the vics.
- Apparently.

28:17.404 --> 28:20.032
So, Fran said that
Rita told them to screw off and...

28:20.616 --> 28:23.495
Well, before they had a chance
to confront him, he killed himself.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.955
So, suicide led to a vengeful spirit.

28:26.163 --> 28:27.790
I mean, It's not like
we haven't seen it before.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.633
Or maybe it wasn't suicide.

28:36.131 --> 28:39.476
Hey, Max, right? ls, is your mom home?

28:39.676 --> 28:40.677
Not yet.

28:40.844 --> 28:44.565
Okay, uh, I just needed to ask her
a few more questions.

28:45.474 --> 28:46.646
Um...

28:48.477 --> 28:50.229
I guess you can wait inside.

28:51.688 --> 28:52.814
Okay.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.836
Hey. Poker? I can show you a move or two.

29:06.328 --> 29:09.081
Magic trick. Something my uncle taught me.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.546
Ah. Yeah, you were
pretty close to him, huh?

29:12.626 --> 29:13.752
Yeah.

29:15.796 --> 29:18.015
He was cool. I miss him.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.934
He sounds like a good guy.

29:21.510 --> 29:22.511
He was.

29:26.682 --> 29:30.357
What those men said about him,
it wasn't true.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.652
I don't appreciate you talking to my son
when I'm not home!

29:33.814 --> 29:36.014
Okay, we were just trading
some card tricks, that's all.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.344
What are you even doing here?
I told you everything I know.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.202
Okay, honey, go to your room.

29:49.204 --> 29:52.879
Look, we know that the coach and Stan
confronted you about Chester.

29:53.166 --> 29:56.136
That is none of your damn business.
It has nothing to do with any of this.

29:56.378 --> 29:57.550
Those men were murdered.

29:57.713 --> 30:00.113
And whether or not you believe it,
your brother is connected.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.763
How? Chester is dead. Killed himself.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.519
- You sure about that?
- Oh...

30:06.305 --> 30:09.809
Look, we need to know the truth.
People's lives are at stake here.

30:09.975 --> 30:10.976
Yeah.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.069
Maybe yours. Maybe Max's.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.830
Okay. Okay.

30:25.741 --> 30:29.917
A couple months ago,
Stan and the coach came by.

30:30.954 --> 30:33.207
They said
that Chester was with their kids,

30:33.999 --> 30:35.251
did something...

30:36.752 --> 30:37.753
Inappropriate.

30:40.922 --> 30:42.674
I got defensive. I mean...

30:43.800 --> 30:46.428
Chester was sweet. Like a dad to Max.
So, I told 'em to get lost.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.472
If they had a problem with Chester,
they could go to the cops.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.639
But they didn't?

30:49.806 --> 30:51.274
They didn't have any evidence.

30:53.769 --> 30:56.864
But then I started to have my doubts.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.943
I mean, as much as I wanted
to defend my brother...

31:03.695 --> 31:05.413
What they said really

31:06.782 --> 31:08.079
got under my skin.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.461
Chester was always a little off.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.374
He only got along with kids,
that's why he became a party performer.

31:17.292 --> 31:21.468
I spent my whole life
sticking up for my brother.

31:25.967 --> 31:29.471
But what if I couldn't see him
for who he really was?

31:30.722 --> 31:32.395
And he and Max were so close.

31:35.268 --> 31:37.487
What if he was hurting him
and I didn't know?

31:39.815 --> 31:41.192
Chester was my brother,

31:42.859 --> 31:44.281
but Max is my son.

31:45.195 --> 31:46.947
So, you wanted to protect him.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.788
How could I look the other way?

31:52.369 --> 31:55.543
I'd to suck it up and face
my biggest fear. If not me, then who?

31:56.665 --> 31:58.258
But I should've talked to him.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.044
I just should've gone to him first.

32:03.630 --> 32:04.631
Instead,

32:07.008 --> 32:08.305
I called Stan back.

32:11.221 --> 32:13.189
And he said that
they would take care of it.

32:13.849 --> 32:16.944
So, one day, when Chester was working,

32:18.311 --> 32:20.188
I told them where he was.

32:34.411 --> 32:35.537
Going somewhere?

32:35.871 --> 32:37.339
Yeah. Home.

32:38.039 --> 32:39.040
I don't think so.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.378
Hey. Hey!

32:43.211 --> 32:44.508
Help! Help!

32:45.088 --> 32:47.090
They promised me that
they weren't going to hurt Chester.

32:47.549 --> 32:49.722
They were just gonna scare him
a little bit.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.855
And I thought, maybe a good scare...

32:56.433 --> 32:57.730
Maybe that's all he needed.

33:02.522 --> 33:05.742
Stop! Stop, please! Stop!
Why are you doing this?

33:06.276 --> 33:09.120
You know why, sicko! Leave our kids alone!

33:09.446 --> 33:11.744
I would never hurt your kids
or anyone's kids!

33:12.073 --> 33:13.074
I love kids!

33:13.325 --> 33:14.747
Yeah. We know.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.376
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Stop it! We're not gonna...

33:19.539 --> 33:20.756
- Let me go!
- Stop it!

33:21.082 --> 33:24.586
- Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
- We won't! Stop, stop it!

33:24.794 --> 33:26.592
{THUDS)

33:30.592 --> 33:31.844
They didn't mean to kill him.

33:32.177 --> 33:35.272
They said that it was an accident,

33:35.472 --> 33:38.646
but I wasn't there, so I didn't know
what to believe.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.448
And I wanted to go to the cops
and explain what happened.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.916
But Stan said that we'd all go to jail.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.417
And I couldn't do that to Max.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.504
He already lost his father

34:05.001 --> 34:06.173
and his uncle.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.215
And he couldn't lose me, too.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.512
So I didn't say anything.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.478
Fear cripples you.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.728
It makes you do nothing.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.313
Or worse.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.994
It makes you do something
that you regret.

34:33.362 --> 34:34.956
I should've trusted my brother.

34:46.501 --> 34:47.592
Hey. How's it going?

34:47.877 --> 34:49.675
Tracked down every last costume.

34:49.838 --> 34:52.216
You didn't happen to see
a deer head by chance, did you?

34:53.632 --> 34:54.634
Deer head?

34:55.342 --> 34:56.344
Oh, my God!

34:59.055 --> 35:00.056
That wasn't on the list.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.240
Max?

35:16.197 --> 35:17.574
Max? Max!

35:22.495 --> 35:24.122
Max? Max...

35:25.373 --> 35:29.298
Max. Max. No! What are you doing?

35:29.919 --> 35:31.136
Max!

35:36.051 --> 35:37.098
Max?

35:40.221 --> 35:41.894
Mom, what's happening?

35:44.976 --> 35:46.819
Hey! Burn it, now!

36:05.538 --> 36:06.835
Come with me.

36:07.123 --> 36:08.249
Okay.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.810
Okay. Whatever you do,
stay inside this circle.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.982
- I don't understand.
- Ghosts.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.068
You wanna know
how this ties to your brother?

36:27.102 --> 36:30.481
Cause and effect.
Wrongful death spawns a vengeful spirit.

36:30.814 --> 36:31.861
Chester?

36:50.834 --> 36:52.177
Uncle Chester! No!

37:54.606 --> 37:57.200
All right,
I think it's time we get out of here.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.457
Here's hoping something less murderous
brings you back to Minnesota.

38:02.489 --> 38:04.867
Like Prince. Or Cheese Curd Fest.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.701
You had me at "curd."

38:08.119 --> 38:11.749
I don't know how you two do this,
day in, day out.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.091
Figuring out who's possessed, who isn't.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.961
Your life's one big poop storm, isn't it?

38:18.713 --> 38:19.965
Spoken like a true hunter.

38:20.590 --> 38:21.807
Really?

38:22.383 --> 38:23.430
Hunter?

38:23.718 --> 38:27.723
Oh, yeah. I mean, with three cases
under your belt, I think you earned it.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.059
Okay.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.399
Yeah.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.314
There we go.

38:37.690 --> 38:38.691
Thank you.

38:39.484 --> 38:40.781
- Bye.
- Bye.

38:42.821 --> 38:46.075
So, been a crazy couple of days.

38:46.658 --> 38:47.910
Darn tootin'.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.082
But you've been great.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.247
I really appreciate all your hard work.

38:53.206 --> 38:55.129
And...

38:56.209 --> 38:58.507
I'm sorry if I was a little tough on you.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.060
You mean treatin' me like a punching bag?

39:02.841 --> 39:04.468
It's okay. Really.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.762
I got baggage, too, Donna.

39:08.888 --> 39:09.935
Everyone does.

39:12.100 --> 39:15.229
And if it makes you feel any better,
you can call me by my middle name,

39:16.145 --> 39:17.146
Lonnie.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.786
I think "Doug" will do just fine.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.196
Okay.

39:39.752 --> 39:41.004
I keep praying to God

39:41.170 --> 39:45.300
because if it is God, and I know
you think it isn't, but if it is,

39:46.634 --> 39:50.389
and he's showing me something
I don't know what to do with...

39:52.390 --> 39:53.482
What?

39:57.478 --> 39:58.479
The Cage.

40:00.690 --> 40:01.691
Lucifer's Cage?

40:03.151 --> 40:04.152
Yeah.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.410
What if he's
telling me I have to go back?

40:08.323 --> 40:11.577
What if he's saying that's where
the answer is to beating The Darkness?

40:12.160 --> 40:14.333
Sam. No, no, okay.

40:14.579 --> 40:18.709
Look, I don't know if these visions
are coming from God or PBS or what,

40:20.001 --> 40:21.253
but we've been down that road.

40:22.712 --> 40:25.716
Anything having to do
with that cage is, it's suicide.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.008
You of all people know that.

40:28.885 --> 40:29.886
So, no.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.976
Just not gonna happen.

40:38.686 --> 40:39.812
Okay.

40:43.775 --> 40:44.867
Okay.

41:26.067 --> 41:27.068
