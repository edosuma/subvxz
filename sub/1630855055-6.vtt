WEBVTT

00:19.083 --> 00:20.083
Now

00:20.583 --> 00:23.708
we are entering a collective dream.

00:23.708 --> 00:25.416
You sound like a magician.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.250
I <i>am</i> a magician!

00:27.750 --> 00:30.208
Now fold the paper like me.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.500
And

00:34.583 --> 00:35.916
pass it again.

00:37.833 --> 00:38.750
That's it.

00:39.833 --> 00:40.958
Open them.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.166
All right!

00:42.166 --> 00:45.833
"A wanton son sighs her sneezes."

00:45.833 --> 00:48.083
"The ancient ocean eats her young."

00:48.083 --> 00:50.750
"My drunken terrier hates the moon."

00:50.750 --> 00:53.833
"Every forgotten slug loves a crayon."

00:55.291 --> 00:58.458
-"A tired villain dances the waves."
Oh!

00:58.458 --> 01:01.250
"The silly tree longs for justice."

01:02.583 --> 01:05.958
"The exquisite corpse needs more wine."

01:05.958 --> 01:07.166
Yes!

01:07.166 --> 01:08.708
Papa!

01:08.708 --> 01:09.833
Get out of there!

01:09.833 --> 01:12.708
And there is something strange
under the table.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.916
- What?
What? What?

01:22.833 --> 01:24.125
So we have a spy.

01:24.833 --> 01:26.916
- Well, we have a microphone.
- How does it work?

01:26.916 --> 01:28.333
Radio signal, battery.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.666
- Someone's recording us remotely.
But who?

01:30.666 --> 01:32.458
Anyone could buy a microphone.

01:32.458 --> 01:35.875
Surely the question isn't who's listening,
but what did they hear?

01:35.875 --> 01:38.625
We planned that break-in
at Camp des Milles at that table.

01:39.958 --> 01:41.208
In detail.

01:46.166 --> 01:47.000
My God.

01:48.666 --> 01:50.541
I have to get everyone out of here.

01:51.166 --> 01:52.541
I can take up to 300.

01:52.541 --> 01:53.750
Tomorrow?

01:53.750 --> 01:55.250
With paperwork, yes.

01:56.833 --> 01:58.791
Okay. Then I need to get to work.

02:06.541 --> 02:09.791
- A little bit more. A little bit more.

02:09.791 --> 02:11.125
Stop. That's too far.

02:11.125 --> 02:13.083
To the right. Okay, stop, uh...

02:13.875 --> 02:14.875
Uh, stop!

02:15.666 --> 02:17.500
Right there. Perfect.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.791
Now the basket should go over there.

02:24.625 --> 02:26.416
Stay. Stay. Stay.

02:32.750 --> 02:36.958
What are we gonna do about these fools?
Emergency Rescue Committee, my foot.

02:36.958 --> 02:40.125
I wouldn't assume
Varian Fry was involved in any of this.

02:40.125 --> 02:43.750
- Mary Jayne Gold is one thing--
- Mary Jayne Gold is ridiculous.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.833
Well, even ridiculous Americans

02:46.833 --> 02:49.250
who make trouble for the French police
make trouble for me.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.083
Ah. Damn it.

02:55.708 --> 02:58.375
There must've been someone else
involved in that prison break.

02:59.958 --> 03:00.791
Where's Reese?

03:00.791 --> 03:02.750
You sent him over to the ERC office.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.416
Well, I'm gonna have to count on you,
then, Bingham.

03:05.416 --> 03:08.875
Uh, just find me
some other brand of foreigner

03:08.875 --> 03:11.125
we can pin this on
before Frot circles back to Miss Gold.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.250
- Me?
- Just do it, will you?

03:13.250 --> 03:17.166
Look through the files. Anyone
who applied for a visa in the last year,

03:17.166 --> 03:19.875
pick someone we can track down.
Someone who isn't American.

03:19.875 --> 03:22.166
- You can't possibly be asking--
- That'll be all.

03:24.416 --> 03:26.083
Do you want me to take the dog?

03:27.000 --> 03:27.833
No.

03:41.916 --> 03:42.916
Good morning.

03:50.083 --> 03:52.750
Fry...
Easy. Just here to see Lena.

03:57.666 --> 04:01.666
- Where is everybody?
- Word's got around that, um...

04:01.666 --> 04:03.333
- Let's speak outside.
- Yes.

04:05.250 --> 04:08.000
How many people have you managed
to corral for Dubois's boat?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.250
Maybe 50?

04:16.125 --> 04:19.000
He says he can take up to 300,
but he sails tomorrow morning.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.083
What? You said we have two weeks.

04:21.083 --> 04:23.333
I know. Vichy is opening
and closing the port at random,

04:23.333 --> 04:25.125
so we have to grab the chance now.

04:26.125 --> 04:27.791
Have you heard from Bingham?

04:27.791 --> 04:30.166
The Bretons' visa
came through from the MoMA.

04:30.166 --> 04:32.750
He's done one for Mehring,
one for Hannah Arendt.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.250
He can only do a few at a time
without getting caught.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.833
Excellent. And what about the letter
from the Chinese consulate?

04:37.833 --> 04:40.041
Bill's working on it. See what he says.

04:40.041 --> 04:44.000
In the meantime, go to the beaches,
the bars, the small hotels,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.583
round up everyone you can find,

04:45.583 --> 04:47.833
and bring them to the villa by night.
Can you do that?

04:48.666 --> 04:49.541
Yes.

04:49.541 --> 04:51.625
And tell Bingham to meet me there too.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.500
I will be damned if we don't fill
every single spot on that boat.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.833
How's it going there, Bill?

05:10.916 --> 05:11.958
What is all this?

05:12.958 --> 05:15.708
I ran out of commercial ink,
so I've been mixing my own.

05:18.041 --> 05:21.208
This Chinese calligraphy,
it's something else.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.916
Do you know what it says?

05:22.916 --> 05:26.333
Not exactly. Just that it's an entry visa
to the Republic of China.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.708
How many do we have?

05:29.541 --> 05:30.375
Um...

05:31.041 --> 05:33.541
I've got about 30
you can take with you right now.

05:34.125 --> 05:37.291
And another six on the line.

05:38.583 --> 05:40.458
Incredible. Thank you.

05:40.458 --> 05:43.083
Happy to help.
- Keep up the good work, Bill.

05:46.375 --> 05:49.250
Every train between Marseille
and Dijon has to cross that bridge.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.083
We blow the legs, the tracks collapse.

05:51.875 --> 05:53.708
If they start deporting prisoners
to the Reich,

05:53.708 --> 05:55.333
they'll have to send them through Dijon.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.583
- Unless we make it impossible first.
- Right.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.208
Are you listening to me?

06:01.083 --> 06:02.041
Hm?

06:02.041 --> 06:05.625
- Keep your eyes on the prize, my friend.
- My eyes are firmly on the prize.

06:05.625 --> 06:08.708
- Hm. You are lovesick.
- I'm not sick. I am calm.

06:08.708 --> 06:11.416
Just because
Lisa's husband came back, I'm--

06:11.416 --> 06:13.958
Uh-uh. Mary Jayne is different
from the rest of us.

06:13.958 --> 06:17.166
Because of what? Because she's American?

06:17.166 --> 06:18.125
Maybe.

06:18.125 --> 06:21.291
- Look at all the risks she's taking.
Mm.

06:21.291 --> 06:24.208
Albert, you and I are
fighting for our own survival.

06:24.208 --> 06:26.625
Miss Mary Jayne Gold can
just leave here at any time.

06:29.916 --> 06:31.666
<i>Merde,</i> a police escort. Come.

06:36.583 --> 06:40.166
- What do you think's inside?
Those are big trucks for cargo.

06:41.041 --> 06:43.458
And why would they cover cargo
with tarpaulins?

06:44.500 --> 06:47.333
Prisoners.
They started deporting prisoners.

06:54.541 --> 06:58.583
"Then the Egyptians
reduced the children of Israel

06:58.583 --> 07:01.500
to a hard servitude."

07:03.250 --> 07:07.750
"And they made their lives dull and bitter

07:07.750 --> 07:11.000
with hard bondage, in mortar,

07:11.000 --> 07:12.375
and in brick,

07:12.375 --> 07:16.625
and by all the works of the fields,
and it was with cruelty."

07:16.625 --> 07:19.375
André, you in here?
Sh.

07:20.125 --> 07:23.416
I am reading the Book of Exodus
to our new friends.

07:27.125 --> 07:31.333
Your American visas came through.
You, Jacqueline, and Aube.

07:31.333 --> 07:34.625
We're putting all of you
on a boat to Martinique tomorrow morning.

07:34.625 --> 07:35.875
Such good news!

07:35.875 --> 07:37.916
You can
travel to New York from there.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.541
And what about me?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.625
The US will never take you, Victor,

07:43.625 --> 07:48.416
and you know that your proud record
as a revolutionary precedes you.

07:48.416 --> 07:51.291
Your Chinese visa will get you
as far as Martinique with them.

07:51.291 --> 07:54.625
Wait. The Chinese gave Serge a visa?

07:54.625 --> 07:56.791
Bill Freier has made 30 copies,

07:56.791 --> 07:59.625
so we can use it for other people,
including Victor Brauner.

08:00.458 --> 08:02.708
What exactly does this Chinese visa say?

08:02.708 --> 08:05.041
Truthfully, I don't know
'cause I don't read Chinese.

08:06.041 --> 08:09.416
And I am counting on the fact
that the French officials don't either.

08:09.958 --> 08:11.041
I read Chinese.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.416
This isn't a visa.

08:22.708 --> 08:25.625
This says, "The bearer of this document

08:25.625 --> 08:29.666
can never and will never
be admitted into the Republic of China."

08:34.583 --> 08:35.791
Damn it.

08:50.333 --> 08:51.458
Oh!

08:58.708 --> 09:00.750
Who knew you were such a romantic?

09:01.500 --> 09:02.416
I'm not.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.125
I have terrible news.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.458
They've started deporting prisoners
from Marseille.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.750
- To Germany?
- At least as far as Dijon.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.333
What about you?

09:23.041 --> 09:25.416
- What about me?
- What if they deport you?

09:26.083 --> 09:28.958
I'm not a prisoner.
They'll have to catch me first.

09:28.958 --> 09:32.375
No, but they just found
a recording device in the dining room.

09:33.083 --> 09:34.541
That means whoever was listening

09:34.541 --> 09:37.000
heard us plan the break-in
at Camp des Milles.

09:41.958 --> 09:42.833
Albert!

09:45.583 --> 09:47.583
The boat to Martinique
sets sail in 18 hours.

09:47.583 --> 09:48.541
Tomorrow morning?

09:48.541 --> 09:51.666
Yes. Lena's already rounding up
as many passengers as possible,

09:51.666 --> 09:52.791
so I need your help.

09:52.791 --> 09:56.458
Can you and Albert take Serge downtown
and do the rounds again?

09:56.458 --> 09:57.833
Again?

09:57.833 --> 10:01.583
They've all rejected him. He told
the Brazilian consulate he's a Communist.

10:01.583 --> 10:06.041
Then we go to the Belgian Congo,
and he said that he's an anarchist.

10:06.041 --> 10:09.333
We go to the Cubans, and he says
he's an unapologetic revolutionary.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.708
Please. The offices are only open
a few more hours.

10:11.708 --> 10:14.958
Let's start with Mexico.
I think that consul took a shine to us.

10:14.958 --> 10:17.541
- To <i>you.</i>
- We will do it.

10:17.541 --> 10:19.000
- Thank you.
Yes. Okay.

10:39.375 --> 10:41.583
Welcome to the Villa Air-Bel. Hi.

10:42.666 --> 10:44.500
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.333
What's all this?

10:50.333 --> 10:53.250
Every foreigner who has
applied for an American visa

10:53.250 --> 10:55.416
at this office in the last year.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.916
Any of them could have
helped Mademoiselle Gold.

11:00.541 --> 11:04.375
- These are innocent people.
- Well, that's a matter of opinion.

11:13.708 --> 11:14.666
Hi.
- Mr. Fry.

11:14.666 --> 11:18.041
Very happy you're here safely.
Let me know if you need anything.

11:25.791 --> 11:26.708
Bingham!

11:28.875 --> 11:32.041
I came as soon as Lena called.
Are these the Bretons' visas?

11:32.833 --> 11:35.125
But what are
all these other people doing here?

11:35.125 --> 11:37.125
Dubois said he could take
up to 300 people.

11:37.125 --> 11:39.125
How will you pay for so many boat tickets?

11:39.125 --> 11:43.125
Peggy Guggenheim donated the funds.
But that's the least of my concerns.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.458
The house has been bugged.

11:47.375 --> 11:49.333
I can't keep people here anymore.

11:49.916 --> 11:53.166
It's always been a risk.
But now they're rounding people up.

11:53.166 --> 11:55.250
All the local prisons are nearly full.

11:55.750 --> 11:59.583
- Who knows where they would take them.
- Like deport them to Germany?

12:00.625 --> 12:04.416
I mean, if we were raided again,
these people are doomed. Listen.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.041
With the boat,
we can work around the French exit stamps

12:08.041 --> 12:09.916
'cause the captain is a friend.

12:09.916 --> 12:14.166
But each passenger still needs
some kind of off-continent entry visa,

12:14.166 --> 12:16.916
and I'm running out of time here.
We've been everywhere.

12:17.708 --> 12:18.833
Bingham, please.

12:19.833 --> 12:20.916
Please. We need help.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.291
Do you have a list of names?

12:30.458 --> 12:33.750
This is everyone that we could find
who is ready to go tomorrow.

12:34.833 --> 12:38.500
And I need to talk to Albert... Hirschman.
I think it's time to get him out.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.416
- Hirschman? First name's Otto Albert?
- Mm-hmm.

12:41.416 --> 12:42.833
A visa came in for him already.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.500
He just hasn't picked it up yet.

12:45.000 --> 12:45.833
I'll speak to him.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.000
The same is true
for the Chagalls, as you know.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.416
That visa's been there for months.
Why don't they use it?

12:50.416 --> 12:53.416
I keep trying and trying.
They just... They won't leave.

12:53.416 --> 12:55.625
- Not Victor Serge. He's a Communist.
- I know.

12:55.625 --> 12:59.916
Victor Brauner is impossible. I told you
the US isn't taking Romanians yet.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.791
I'll see what I can do
about all the others.

13:04.791 --> 13:06.541
Meet you tomorrow morning at the boat?

13:07.541 --> 13:08.416
- Okay.
- Good.

13:09.916 --> 13:11.166
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.750
Where's Bingham?

13:14.458 --> 13:15.291
Lunch?

13:15.291 --> 13:17.583
- He's gone native.
Sorry?

13:17.583 --> 13:20.875
The French treat lunch like a vacation.
He leave that for me?

13:20.875 --> 13:22.208
Uh, actually, yes.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.375
He doesn't look very threatening.

13:29.041 --> 13:29.916
How should he look?

13:29.916 --> 13:32.541
Well, I said foreign.
This guy's not even Jewish.

13:32.541 --> 13:35.500
- He's a socialist.
- You can see that from the photo?

13:35.500 --> 13:37.708
Miss Gold broke Hans Fittko out
of Des Milles!

13:39.083 --> 13:40.208
How do you know that?

13:42.750 --> 13:45.666
- I called the camp.
- And they told you that?

13:46.250 --> 13:48.458
It helps to speak French.

13:51.583 --> 13:53.875
He was the mastermind on the inside.

13:56.666 --> 14:00.416
So, how do I find this Hans Fittko?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.041
With the rest of them, of course.

14:05.708 --> 14:07.166
La Villa Air-Bel.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.083
I'm waiting for you
to tell me what you want.

14:33.625 --> 14:34.500
Lisa.

14:40.708 --> 14:41.958
I want to join Paul.

14:43.625 --> 14:44.458
Paul?

14:44.958 --> 14:45.791
Yes.

14:46.958 --> 14:50.583
You should get to know him.
He's going to change the world.

14:52.791 --> 14:54.708
I'm going to his meeting tonight.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.083
Come with me.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.833
Or maybe we just go to America

15:01.750 --> 15:03.083
with the rest of them.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.333
We'll start over.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.333
We applied for visas a year ago.

15:07.958 --> 15:10.875
Maybe Varian can do something
and then we'll get on that boat.

15:10.875 --> 15:11.791
Lisa...

15:12.500 --> 15:13.416
Why not?

15:14.416 --> 15:16.041
We can't go to America now.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.958
America. I can't wait.
What is surrealism

15:20.958 --> 15:24.833
if not a Romanian painter
on a cowboy horse in Texas?

15:46.625 --> 15:48.000
- Okay, Victor.
- Hm?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.125
When we get in there,

15:52.500 --> 15:55.291
just please try
to keep your mouth shut, yeah?

15:56.291 --> 15:58.250
- Just for your own sake.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.708
The petite bourgeoisie who control
the visas don't care about civilization.

16:02.708 --> 16:03.625
No politics.

16:03.625 --> 16:05.500
Politics are my life.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.750
The petite bourgeoisie
who control the visas

16:07.750 --> 16:09.833
don't have to know that. Do they?

16:10.458 --> 16:12.791
Do you want to end up on a train
to a Nazi prison camp?

16:12.791 --> 16:13.916
Albert!

16:16.000 --> 16:18.291
It's not about submission.
It's about survival.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.958
- He understands that.

16:19.958 --> 16:22.291
- Who cares about my survival?
- I care.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.291
Right. We care.

16:24.041 --> 16:25.041
We care.

16:26.125 --> 16:27.125
Thank you.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.458
- Do you know what?
- Hm?

16:35.333 --> 16:36.625
You could marry him.

16:38.875 --> 16:39.708
Victor?

16:40.208 --> 16:41.875
If this doesn't work out.

16:43.041 --> 16:43.958
Seriously.

16:43.958 --> 16:47.291
You always say that you're prepared to use
all the tools at your disposal.

16:47.958 --> 16:48.916
Well,

16:49.416 --> 16:51.166
a US visa,

16:52.166 --> 16:54.083
that's just about the most powerful thing

16:54.083 --> 16:57.583
an unmarried American woman
has to offer a refugee in Europe.

17:00.875 --> 17:02.708
The consul will see you now.

17:03.791 --> 17:06.333
I do make an excellent husband.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.958
Señor Bosques.

17:14.750 --> 17:15.583
Señorita Gold.

17:15.583 --> 17:17.208
We're back to implore you

17:17.208 --> 17:20.208
to reconsider the plight
of our friend Victor Serge.

17:20.791 --> 17:23.291
He concerns himself
with the rights of man.

17:23.791 --> 17:27.500
Now, not every foreign consulate
has the political sensitivity

17:27.500 --> 17:29.833
to understand that as an advantage,

17:30.500 --> 17:35.458
but we think your revolutionary mind
will see his enormous value.

17:37.375 --> 17:40.166
Harassment, detention, starvation,

17:40.166 --> 17:42.125
exile, internment.

17:42.125 --> 17:43.958
It drove his first wife mad.

17:43.958 --> 17:46.125
- Are you his second wife?
- No.

17:46.916 --> 17:48.666
You are our last hope.

17:58.166 --> 18:00.583
- Okay, I will take care of it.
- Thank you.

18:01.458 --> 18:02.750
<i>Oui,</i> Señor Serge.

18:02.750 --> 18:05.500
Long live the revolution!

18:08.500 --> 18:10.541
How was lunch?
- Sir.

18:13.208 --> 18:16.083
There's an article in the paper
about a writer named Golo Mann.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.000
Ring a bell?

18:17.500 --> 18:18.333
No.

18:18.875 --> 18:22.125
Just another Jewish writer
on the Nazi reject list.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.208
Here's the thing.

18:24.416 --> 18:29.250
In the article, it says
diplomats in Marseille helped get him out.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
How does that work?

18:34.083 --> 18:38.208
If you had to play Good Samaritan
to some goddamn intellectual,

18:38.208 --> 18:39.958
couldn't you have had the good sense

18:39.958 --> 18:42.583
to pick someone
who would keep his mouth shut?

18:45.500 --> 18:47.958
Meanwhile, Reese says there's
a young lady in the office,

18:47.958 --> 18:50.250
someone mixed up
in that racket Fry is running,

18:50.250 --> 18:52.250
who's always talking to you on the phone.

18:53.291 --> 18:55.416
- I don't know about that.
No?

18:55.416 --> 18:57.333
- No.
- I'm watching you, Bingham.

18:59.708 --> 19:00.708
Get it together.

19:35.583 --> 19:36.666
Proud of yourself?

19:37.666 --> 19:41.125
Once everyone's on a boat
and halfway to Martinique, maybe.

19:41.625 --> 19:42.875
I'm proud of you.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.875
Hey.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.500
- Can I have a word?
- Yeah, of course.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Just a second.

20:12.375 --> 20:14.916
I believe they've started
deporting prisoners.

20:16.458 --> 20:17.458
They're using

20:18.541 --> 20:20.791
convoys of trucks on backcountry roads.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.208
Oh my God.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.416
And I've been talking with Paul.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.750
I want to prepare for violent resistance.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.708
Or you could just leave Europe altogether.

20:37.375 --> 20:38.916
Why would you even say that?

20:38.916 --> 20:43.416
Bingham said there's a US visa
with your name on it at the US consulate.

20:43.416 --> 20:46.708
- My sister Ursula arranged it.
- You should be on that boat tomorrow.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.666
Before you're the one
getting deported back to the Reich.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.125
I don't know how long
the port's gonna be open.

20:54.125 --> 20:56.500
This might be your last chance.
Have you thought about that?

20:57.666 --> 20:59.041
I'm not going anywhere.

21:01.166 --> 21:02.041
Not now.

21:03.541 --> 21:04.541
God.

21:12.375 --> 21:13.458
How are you doing?

21:14.791 --> 21:16.666
Does Mary Jayne know about your visa?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.583
What are you doing, Sebastian?

21:37.333 --> 21:38.541
My camera is broken.

21:39.875 --> 21:45.333
And anyway, I have no film,
so I'm making a film in my head.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.125
That's a wonderful idea.

21:53.708 --> 21:55.958
Pay attention, everybody!

21:55.958 --> 21:58.458
Sebastian here is making a film

21:58.458 --> 22:01.083
about our last night in paradise.

22:01.083 --> 22:03.500
Yes!

23:45.708 --> 23:48.375
Paul's already recruited
more than 20 people.

23:49.250 --> 23:52.000
I'm so sorry
that I couldn't get Lisa to come.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.791
That's so unlike her.

24:36.916 --> 24:38.291
Follow that truck.

24:40.041 --> 24:41.166
Wait, stop!

24:51.500 --> 24:52.666
Dagobert?

24:53.875 --> 24:54.750
Dagobert!

24:54.750 --> 24:56.208
Oh my goodn--

24:56.208 --> 24:58.000
How did you find me?

24:58.000 --> 24:59.458
Look at you.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.583
Oh, you're such a good boy.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.500
Oh, you're so smart.

26:24.958 --> 26:28.833
Who can tell me what that is?
- The opening bars of Beethoven's Fifth?

26:30.500 --> 26:31.500
What else?

26:32.708 --> 26:33.708
Listen carefully.

26:38.583 --> 26:40.583
<i>♪ Ba, ba, ba, bam ♪</i>

26:40.583 --> 26:42.458
Do any of you know Morse code?

26:43.375 --> 26:45.333
Short, short, short, long.

26:45.958 --> 26:47.083
That's the letter V.

26:47.583 --> 26:49.125
V for victory.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.875
From now on,
we will use this music as a signal

26:52.875 --> 26:55.958
to communicate with our comrades
over public radio channels.

26:55.958 --> 26:58.250
Listen for these opening bars as a signal.

26:58.750 --> 27:03.000
The poems and music
that follow Beethoven's Fifth

27:03.791 --> 27:05.208
will be secret messages.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.000
Long live the Resistance!

27:09.000 --> 27:13.333
- Long live the Resistance!
- Long live the Resistance!

27:26.916 --> 27:28.291
Who are you?

27:28.791 --> 27:30.291
It's the middle of the night.

27:30.291 --> 27:31.458
What do you want?

27:32.291 --> 27:33.416
Mother!

27:33.416 --> 27:34.958
What's wrong?

27:34.958 --> 27:36.166
Who is here?

27:41.666 --> 27:43.958
- Go back to bed, Mother.
- Who is this guy?

27:44.458 --> 27:45.375
To bed!

27:46.125 --> 27:47.791
Good night, Madame.

27:50.916 --> 27:53.000
Had news that couldn't wait.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.375
It turns out the real masterminds
behind the break-in at Camp des Milles

27:56.375 --> 28:00.666
were a socialist named Hans Fittko
and the concierge at the Hotel Splendide.

28:00.666 --> 28:03.541
- Who?
- The African fella at the front desk.

28:03.541 --> 28:06.166
Mind you, he's running
a whole Resistance operation

28:06.166 --> 28:07.958
out of some church downtown.

28:07.958 --> 28:10.125
- You sure about this?
- Saw it with my own eyes.

28:10.125 --> 28:13.500
But by all means,
feel free to look into it for yourself.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.458
Yeah.

28:14.958 --> 28:16.375
I will do exactly that.

28:18.125 --> 28:19.125
You're welcome.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.500
Thank you for everything.

29:18.375 --> 29:21.000
Where is everyone?
- Waiting at the ticket office.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.041
Well,

29:23.416 --> 29:28.208
200 visas for entry to the United States.
Stamped at the US consulate in Marseille

29:28.916 --> 29:32.291
and signed, officially,
with Graham Patterson's pen.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.708
Go, go, hurry up!

29:44.708 --> 29:46.833
- Don't stop moving!
- Go, go, go!

29:53.208 --> 29:54.208
Monsieur Fry.

29:55.541 --> 29:57.958
Will you hand these out? Thank you.

29:57.958 --> 29:59.750
Sara...
- Here.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.750
Staus Arabar?
- Here.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.583
- Alexander Levine?
- Bruno Levkowitz?

30:03.583 --> 30:04.666
Here you go.

30:09.166 --> 30:10.625
Long live Mexico.

30:13.833 --> 30:14.750
Come here.

30:39.125 --> 30:41.041
Get in back.
- What?

30:41.041 --> 30:43.000
Get in back! Get in back! Now!

30:53.958 --> 30:56.541
Mr. Paul...

30:58.666 --> 30:59.666
Kandjo?

31:02.458 --> 31:03.458
At your service.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.250
Stop! Stop!

31:16.666 --> 31:19.250
On your knees.
You're under arrest!

31:24.000 --> 31:24.875
Stand up.

31:27.208 --> 31:28.041
That's fine.

31:28.041 --> 31:29.000
Move.

31:35.708 --> 31:36.958
I said move.

31:36.958 --> 31:37.916
Move.

32:23.916 --> 32:24.833
Letoret!

32:28.708 --> 32:32.125
Mr. Nugent has arrived.
He's setting up in the conference room.

32:32.125 --> 32:34.833
- Someone's been sitting at my desk.
- Someone...

32:39.458 --> 32:41.916
Bingham's been issuing visas
without my approval.

32:41.916 --> 32:43.541
It has to be Bingham. Damn it!

32:43.541 --> 32:47.250
- Are boats leaving the harbor?
- Vichy opened the port this morning.

32:47.250 --> 32:50.166
Then anyone using
an American visa to get on a ship

32:50.166 --> 32:52.125
is using a forgery. Damn it!

32:52.125 --> 32:56.708
Uh, I need to alert the docks, the police.
I should call Frot.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.916
But Doug Nugent is waiting for you.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.416
You're right. Uh...

33:01.416 --> 33:03.625
You do it, then.
Uh, call the police, the docks.

33:03.625 --> 33:04.916
- Call everyone!
- Of course.

33:04.916 --> 33:08.916
Everyone leaving with
an American visa is traveling on a fake!

33:32.166 --> 33:34.166
What have we here? Punch cards.

33:36.166 --> 33:39.708
What you're holding is data
from last year's US census,

33:39.708 --> 33:42.833
but we can customize it
to any client's needs.

33:42.833 --> 33:44.041
Data...

33:44.041 --> 33:45.041
Um...

33:45.875 --> 33:49.333
Age, race, income, marital status.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.958
ACM provides the technology.

33:52.958 --> 33:55.000
We don't tell them how to use it.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
The data serves
to organize people into groups.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.250
Track migration.

34:00.208 --> 34:01.208
Predict behavior.

34:01.208 --> 34:03.041
- Bingham?

34:03.625 --> 34:05.916
Patterson. Mr. Nugent.

34:05.916 --> 34:07.333
- Excuse me for a moment.
- Sure.

34:08.708 --> 34:10.041
You're fired, Bingham.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.625
What?

34:14.333 --> 34:16.291
What are you waiting for? Pack your bags.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Oh, Bingham?

34:28.375 --> 34:29.375
Shut the door.

34:37.333 --> 34:39.208
Have you sold
any of this stuff to the French?

34:39.708 --> 34:41.875
The French, the Swedish...

34:44.000 --> 34:46.666
but the real untapped market,
as we see it,

34:47.333 --> 34:48.416
are the Germans.

34:50.458 --> 34:55.541
Look, American culture is
a stronger weapon than any bomb.

34:56.208 --> 34:59.666
Even our enemies
wanna drive to the movies in a Ford,

34:59.666 --> 35:03.000
drink a Coke,
and watch Scarlett O'Hara save the South.

35:03.625 --> 35:06.666
We're out here in the world
selling ACM products, sure,

35:07.166 --> 35:08.833
but what we're really selling them

35:09.583 --> 35:10.583
is America.

35:43.083 --> 35:45.291
<i>It comes down
to getting the British soldiers</i>

35:45.291 --> 35:47.250
<i>to the right place at the right time.</i>

35:47.750 --> 35:50.666
<i>You distract the guards
at the front. I will find the men.</i>

35:51.375 --> 35:53.875
<i>Then we meet you around here
at the barbed wire.</i>

35:55.333 --> 35:56.458
<i>What's going on?</i>

35:57.083 --> 35:59.708
<i>There's a man named Hans Fittko
with the British--</i>

36:01.791 --> 36:04.625
<i>There's a man named Hans Fittko
with the British prisoners.</i>

36:04.625 --> 36:07.375
<i>My husband. I thought he was dead.</i>

36:12.416 --> 36:13.250
Yes?

36:14.125 --> 36:15.833
Of course, I am coming.

36:33.958 --> 36:34.958
Mademoiselle.

36:35.583 --> 36:36.791
Gruppenführer.

36:38.708 --> 36:41.750
The German Reich
appreciates your faithful service.

36:47.416 --> 36:48.500
Good job.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.458
I'm happy to help.

36:52.833 --> 36:57.625
We got rid of quite a few... degenerates
this morning.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Never mind.

37:15.416 --> 37:17.500
Two hundred and fifty-seven people.

37:18.083 --> 37:19.083
I mean,

37:20.458 --> 37:22.083
that is really something.

37:22.083 --> 37:23.541
It was a good day.

37:24.291 --> 37:26.708
No. It was a <i>great</i> day.

37:34.541 --> 37:35.541
And tomorrow?

37:37.916 --> 37:39.416
There are what?

37:39.416 --> 37:41.750
Nine million Jews in Europe,

37:42.666 --> 37:44.666
let alone everyone else
who needs to get out?

37:44.666 --> 37:46.458
Two hundred and fifty-seven, yeah.

37:48.916 --> 37:50.458
What are we gonna do about the others?

37:51.458 --> 37:52.500
You mean like you?

37:53.333 --> 37:56.291
No, Albert, you should
have been on that boat.

37:56.291 --> 37:59.375
- Do you want me to leave you here?
- No, that's not what I mean.

38:00.208 --> 38:01.083
That's...

38:04.791 --> 38:05.625
Hey.

38:06.416 --> 38:07.416
What?

38:08.916 --> 38:09.875
You...

38:10.375 --> 38:12.500
you could come with me to America.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.375
I could marry you.

38:16.583 --> 38:17.583
Marry me?

38:19.583 --> 38:22.458
Well, Victor Serge,
he's already on his way to Mexico,

38:22.458 --> 38:25.708
and Bellmer,
he just took his dolls and left.

38:25.708 --> 38:28.333
I think Brauner said that
he's gonna go to the hills

38:28.333 --> 38:30.083
and become a shepherd, so...

38:31.541 --> 38:32.666
- Uh...
Yup.

38:33.875 --> 38:37.125
- Brauner herding sheep, huh?
- You could see it, couldn't you?

38:39.666 --> 38:43.958
I'm an unmarried American woman,
as you so delicately put it,

38:45.041 --> 38:48.833
and you are a Jewish man
who needs to get the hell out of Europe.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.291
Think about all the good
we could do for people here

38:52.291 --> 38:53.750
from the United States.

38:54.916 --> 38:57.208
We're already running out
of resources here.

38:57.958 --> 39:02.375
In the States, we would have access
to funding and political influence.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Let's do it.

39:08.333 --> 39:09.458
Run away with me.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.125
You don't want me.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.166
I...

39:23.166 --> 39:25.750
No. Hey, of course I do.

39:27.375 --> 39:29.250
Mary Jayne, when I look at you,

39:30.500 --> 39:32.458
I see the future.

39:35.208 --> 39:37.291
It's just when I close my eyes,
I see the past.

39:37.291 --> 39:39.833
The things that go through my mind, it's...

39:41.291 --> 39:42.875
it's dark in there. I...

39:45.083 --> 39:46.583
I scare myself sometimes.

39:46.583 --> 39:47.666
It's...

39:49.250 --> 39:50.666
But you don't scare me.

40:01.333 --> 40:02.208
Hm.

40:04.916 --> 40:05.916
Okay.

40:07.250 --> 40:08.250
Let's do it.

40:10.791 --> 40:12.000
Let's go to America.

40:17.416 --> 40:18.500
Albert!

40:19.500 --> 40:21.583
Whoa. Whoa. Hey. Hey. What is it?

40:23.083 --> 40:24.375
Sit down. Sit down.

40:26.541 --> 40:28.208
Paul's been arrested by the police.

40:29.625 --> 40:30.916
Where did they take him?

40:31.416 --> 40:32.458
I don't know yet,

40:32.458 --> 40:35.791
but we have to get to him
before they come for the rest of us.
