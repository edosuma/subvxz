00:38.389 --> 00:42.181
Who is this Leonardo da Vinci
that I have to keep an eye on?

00:45.014 --> 00:48.556
Wait, but this is... a boy?

01:52.681 --> 01:54.181
What is this?

01:57.056 --> 01:59.306
Hello Lorenzo! It's
my new invention.

01:59.931 --> 02:02.348
I called her Botte. Are
we going for a ride?

02:02.681 --> 02:06.324
Of course! What questions, Leo.
We do not waste any more time.

02:06.348 --> 02:09.407
Good! I need your help
for the charged engine.

02:09.431 --> 02:12.348
- Did you say a charged engine?
- Exactly. Here we go!

02:20.514 --> 02:22.806
Jump on! Let's go get Lisa.

02:23.723 --> 02:27.407
I wanted to bet! Can you tell
when you say you like it?

02:27.431 --> 02:31.348
- Do you like Lisa? You're crazy?
- Of course you like it!

02:31.598 --> 02:34.282
Do not be stupid,
we're just friends.

02:34.306 --> 02:36.264
And why do you always
talk about her?

02:37.806 --> 02:40.681
Hold on tight. The departure
is a bit animated.

02:41.848 --> 02:44.973
Are you ready? How about
freeing the beast?

02:47.348 --> 02:49.056
Oh!

02:51.014 --> 02:53.699
Help! I'm here behind!

02:53.723 --> 02:56.473
You have to pull me up!

02:57.473 --> 02:59.598
You saw what a beautiful shot.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.223
- Lorenzo?
- Pull me up, Leo!

03:08.264 --> 03:10.848
Do not worry, I'm coming!

03:13.264 --> 03:16.431
- Do you want to get off?
- Are you kidding? Of course not!

03:22.264 --> 03:24.199
- And now what is it?
- Anything.

03:24.223 --> 03:27.157
Is that Lisa makes me
crazy with all her talk.

03:27.181 --> 03:29.657
It never stops, it's
really unbearable.

03:29.681 --> 03:31.449
- Maybe it's better to stop it!
- Yes, but how?

03:31.473 --> 03:33.282
She's a girl, she always
wants to be right.

03:33.306 --> 03:34.931
Botte, stop the Botte!

03:37.181 --> 03:39.389
Done. Sorry, I got distracted.

03:40.723 --> 03:44.348
It also happens to the best drivers, right?
Give me five!

03:47.264 --> 03:50.115
Do not worry, I did a lot
of flight experiments.

03:50.139 --> 03:52.740
- How many times have you flown, Leo?
- Before this?

03:52.764 --> 03:54.431
- Yup.
- None!

03:59.848 --> 04:02.014
We did it Leo, we did it!

04:02.681 --> 04:03.907
Almost done!

04:06.556 --> 04:08.181
Plan B!

04:30.556 --> 04:32.431
So, was it fun or not?

04:34.848 --> 04:37.157
Was it fun? Was it fun?

04:37.181 --> 04:39.740
We just risked
crashing on the ground

04:39.764 --> 04:42.431
and in your opinion was it fun?

04:42.973 --> 04:45.181
- It was mythical!
- Exactly!

04:45.514 --> 04:47.848
This "paracapitomboli"
it works great.

04:48.764 --> 04:51.181
Come on, let's go,
Lisa's house is nearby.

05:15.681 --> 05:18.139
Good morning, Master Chamois!

05:20.431 --> 05:22.264
Good morning to you, Leo!

05:25.306 --> 05:27.098
Do not they bait?

05:29.306 --> 05:31.931
Do not worry. They
will soon catch up.

05:32.681 --> 05:35.157
They do not bite
because they just ate!

05:35.181 --> 05:37.157
- What are you saying?
- Come on, Leonardo,

05:37.181 --> 05:40.949
Everyone knows that after eating you
have to wait at least three hours

05:40.973 --> 05:42.681
before entering the water.

05:44.556 --> 05:46.223
This was good!

05:47.056 --> 05:51.431
Speaking of which, how is your
invention going to go underwater?

05:52.264 --> 05:54.949
Swollen. I called
her a diving suit.

05:54.973 --> 05:58.264
- I was going to the lake to try it.
- Good luck!

06:10.473 --> 06:12.699
Come on, come on, call Lisa.

06:12.723 --> 06:15.782
- Lisa!
- Are you crazy? Do not shout,

06:15.806 --> 06:17.473
or he will also hear his father!

06:18.056 --> 06:20.431
You have to do the owl's verse.

06:30.348 --> 06:34.848
Can you be serious for once?
This is the verse of the owl.

06:42.806 --> 06:44.889
- The direction of the owl.

07:01.431 --> 07:02.764
Ah!

07:09.681 --> 07:12.199
But where did you learn
to stumble like that?

07:12.223 --> 07:14.865
Funny. So why did you call me?

07:14.889 --> 07:17.032
I have so many things to do
for the Harvest Festival.

07:17.056 --> 07:20.681
Yes, there will be music to
eat and desserts to dance.

07:20.973 --> 07:22.639
I mean...

07:22.848 --> 07:25.181
music to dance...

07:25.848 --> 07:27.764
and delicious desserts to eat.

07:28.139 --> 07:30.056
Et voila, mademoiselle!

07:30.556 --> 07:32.365
You are two crazy!

07:32.389 --> 07:35.949
I really hope that at the ball there
is not even the Marquis of Montescuro.

07:35.973 --> 07:37.907
I think he has a crush on me.

07:37.931 --> 07:40.032
What if you invite me to dance?

07:40.056 --> 07:41.848
What are you worried about?

07:44.223 --> 07:46.473
You can teach him the
dance of the moment.

07:52.223 --> 07:54.306
That's just a bitch.

07:54.598 --> 07:58.074
Without the help of his daddy he would
not even know how to blow his nose.

07:58.098 --> 08:00.407
Now just talk, though.

08:00.431 --> 08:03.865
Follow me, I have something
very important to show you.

08:03.889 --> 08:06.699
If it's another of your
inventions to fly,

08:06.723 --> 08:09.574
I do not come, I've
had enough already.

08:09.598 --> 08:12.407
Come, you will not
regret this time.

08:12.431 --> 08:16.032
- Definitely.
- And do not always do the usual surly!

08:16.056 --> 08:18.282
Usual surly me?

08:18.306 --> 08:19.907
Look Who's Talking!

08:19.931 --> 08:22.848
Forget it, Lisa. You
know he's holding us!

08:30.598 --> 08:32.222
Madame.

08:36.639 --> 08:40.014
- And these devilries?
- Wait, wait and see.

08:59.514 --> 09:00.973
Well, it could have been worse.

09:02.014 --> 09:04.973
I had to stay home today.
I knew it.

09:05.306 --> 09:06.931
Here we go!

09:08.181 --> 09:10.723
Now, help me unload
the equipment.

09:12.264 --> 09:14.889
OK sir! At your orders, Sire!

09:17.556 --> 09:19.181
Taken!

09:19.598 --> 09:22.348
And this for what do you need?
Hold on!

09:23.473 --> 09:25.973
Attention... on the fly!

09:28.014 --> 09:29.782
And what are they for?

09:29.806 --> 09:33.889
Lorenzo, do not be so curious, wait
and you'll understand it soon.

09:38.223 --> 09:39.764
This is strange!

09:45.389 --> 09:50.615
And now, you will witness the
first test of my new invention.

09:50.639 --> 09:52.990
Oh... yes, the "Fool".
It's called that, right?

09:53.014 --> 09:57.824
Schifandro? Did you let me
come here for a sucker?

09:57.848 --> 10:00.782
Scafandro, Lisa, is
used to go underwater.

10:00.806 --> 10:04.782
I want to reach 100
steps of depth.

10:04.806 --> 10:08.348
100 steps of depth, where even
fish do not dare to set foot?

10:09.473 --> 10:13.240
Good joke, Leo. Let's go home,
the Harvest Festival awaits us.

10:15.973 --> 10:18.223
But I really want to go.

10:18.598 --> 10:20.365
This place is cursed.

10:20.389 --> 10:23.115
There are scary creatures that have
lived there for millions of years,

10:23.139 --> 10:25.990
and you want to be the
first to meet them?

10:26.014 --> 10:27.973
What are we waiting for?
Put the diving suit on!

10:28.473 --> 10:30.907
How will you breathe underwater?

10:30.931 --> 10:34.199
With this special suit I will not
be crushed by water pressure.

10:34.223 --> 10:37.806
And with this tube tied down
there, Lorenzo will pump the air.

10:42.264 --> 10:44.139
Are you ready, Lorenzo?

10:45.181 --> 10:47.598
If I see a dragon, veil salute!

11:05.889 --> 11:08.306
Hopefully it is not the dragon!

11:10.098 --> 11:11.306
Ah!

11:12.889 --> 11:15.973
Thank god. Fortunately
they were only pigeons!

11:28.306 --> 11:31.407
Leo is reaching 100 steps deep

11:31.431 --> 11:34.098
under the islet in the
middle of the lake.

11:35.181 --> 11:37.657
I would not want something
to happen to him.

11:37.681 --> 11:40.223
That boy will never change.

11:40.723 --> 11:42.764
What do you have to look at?

11:55.181 --> 11:56.806
The bubbles are disappearing!

12:39.806 --> 12:41.806
The bubbles are back!

13:07.264 --> 13:09.074
I'm tired of pumping air,

13:09.098 --> 13:11.723
hopefully at least he
managed to meet the dragon.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.598
Here it is, look,
it's coming back!

13:31.473 --> 13:33.824
Leo, tell us what happened!

13:33.848 --> 13:35.723
What did you see down there?

13:36.681 --> 13:41.324
It was like that, it was so...
it was really incredible!

13:41.348 --> 13:45.865
You realize! 100 steps underwater, no
one has ever been able to do it before!

13:45.889 --> 13:48.449
Even if I have to
improve something,

13:48.473 --> 13:50.848
at one point I was
left without air.

13:56.181 --> 13:58.139
Here. This is for you, Lisa.

14:01.098 --> 14:04.431
And this is for you.
It's a dragon's tooth!

14:06.431 --> 14:08.615
- But this is just a piece of wood!
- Sure!

14:08.639 --> 14:11.056
Did not you know that
dragons have wooden teeth?

14:11.723 --> 14:13.490
I tricked you!

14:15.848 --> 14:18.389
Do you want to stop it?
I have to ton at home!

14:34.473 --> 14:35.848
Hey! Look over there!

14:36.806 --> 14:38.740
It looks like a fire!

14:38.764 --> 14:40.931
Motor at most, Lorenzo!

14:56.681 --> 14:58.699
A moment, but that's my house!

14:58.723 --> 15:01.598
It's burning everything! Soon,
we must go there immediately!

15:03.473 --> 15:05.389
Please, faster, Leo!

15:10.723 --> 15:12.389
It's dangerous, Lisa!

15:20.223 --> 15:22.014
Santa, what happened?

15:27.306 --> 15:28.931
Dad!

15:35.764 --> 15:37.824
The harvest has been lost.

15:37.848 --> 15:41.657
I have to pay the rent of the land
and I do not know how to do it.

15:41.681 --> 15:45.473
I'll have to sell the house
that's all we have left.

15:45.681 --> 15:48.556
Lisa, do not worry,
we'll find a solution.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.990
- Lisa, I do not...
- You "not" what?

15:55.014 --> 15:58.240
And "we will find" who? You
and your absurd inventions?

15:58.264 --> 16:00.990
I told you I did not
have to come today.

16:01.014 --> 16:04.699
- If you stayed home...
- But Lisa, I did not want to...

16:04.723 --> 16:07.723
Go away, go away. I do not
want to see you ever again!

16:17.723 --> 16:19.348
Leo.

16:20.431 --> 16:23.157
Lisa is in trouble, we have
to help her in some way.

16:23.181 --> 16:25.181
How many savings do you have?

16:25.806 --> 16:28.848
- That's all I have.
- I do not think it's enough, Lorenzo.

16:29.764 --> 16:31.431
Guys!

16:32.181 --> 16:34.740
- What happened?
- A tragedy, Master.

16:34.764 --> 16:37.115
The fields and the barn
of Lisa have caught fire!

16:37.139 --> 16:39.032
I hope no one was hurt!

16:39.056 --> 16:41.865
Fortunately not, but
Lisa is destroyed!

16:41.889 --> 16:45.615
I can imagine it, poor girl, those
fields were all for her father.

16:45.639 --> 16:47.199
Yes I know.

16:47.223 --> 16:51.282
I would love to help you, Master,
really, but I do not know how to do it.

16:51.306 --> 16:53.740
I was wondering if you...
here...

16:53.764 --> 16:56.907
Leo, I'm sorry, but I do
not have many savings.

16:56.931 --> 16:59.532
No, no, I did not mean this.

16:59.556 --> 17:01.324
What I was thinking about was...

17:01.348 --> 17:04.615
Yes, I understand what you need.
You need an idea.

17:04.638 --> 17:07.931
Wait, let me think.
But yes, of course.

17:12.763 --> 17:14.388
Try this!

17:15.556 --> 17:17.348
And what is it?

17:17.931 --> 17:21.431
It's my invention. Pen
with incorporated ink.

17:22.638 --> 17:26.888
Bring this cover letter to a
Florentine Master of my knowledge.

17:27.556 --> 17:29.490
You are very good at drawing.

17:29.514 --> 17:31.490
If you work for a
while in your shop,

17:31.514 --> 17:34.490
you can earn a nice sum that
will allow you to help Lisa.

17:34.514 --> 17:37.782
It's perfect, it's
wonderful, Master.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.990
- I do not know how to thank you!
- And I?

17:40.014 --> 17:43.907
You, if I remember correctly, you are
an excellent connoisseur of plants,

17:43.931 --> 17:45.615
vegetables and
vegetables, Lorenzo.

17:45.639 --> 17:47.115
Of course!

17:47.139 --> 17:50.824
So, you could peel carrots
in the kitchen of the shop.

17:50.848 --> 17:52.324
Thank you teacher.

17:52.348 --> 17:54.907
Leo, remember to bring
your drawings too.

17:54.931 --> 17:58.449
And you, Lorenzo, do not
forget the carrot pela!

17:58.473 --> 18:00.740
Sure and thanks again.

18:00.764 --> 18:02.115
Yes thanks.

18:02.139 --> 18:04.532
"Do not forget the carrot pela!"

18:06.014 --> 18:09.098
How dare you? Lorenzo.

18:09.264 --> 18:12.907
But no, I was calling Lisa
to give her the good news.

18:12.931 --> 18:15.473
We use the verse of the owl.

18:15.639 --> 18:17.264
Giggle

18:17.514 --> 18:21.032
Better not waste time, we have to leave
for Florence as soon as possible.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.824
I'm going to get the drawings,
I have yet to finish one.

18:23.848 --> 18:28.264
And tomorrow we'll leave early. Lisa does
not have to know anything, I recommend.

18:28.431 --> 18:30.056
All right!

18:36.389 --> 18:39.556
Lorenzo, wait! You saw... Leo?

18:40.264 --> 18:41.865
Yup! No! No, no.

18:41.889 --> 18:44.157
I did not see that he
went home to get...

18:44.181 --> 18:46.365
To take what? Tell me.

18:46.389 --> 18:49.282
To take the drawings to
bring them to Florence.

18:49.306 --> 18:51.115
But you do not have to know.

18:51.139 --> 18:53.032
What I do not have to know?

18:53.056 --> 18:56.032
Who wants to help you. He
will go to work in a shop

18:56.056 --> 18:58.324
and what you earn will
be used for your farm.

18:58.348 --> 19:00.699
No, no, no, no, no!

19:00.723 --> 19:03.824
And I got mad at him! When
do you want to leave?

19:03.848 --> 19:06.889
I can not tell you because
he does not want to.

19:08.098 --> 19:10.139
Tomorrow at 6:00 o'clock.

19:22.639 --> 19:27.556
Well, then tell me
what I have to do.

19:36.014 --> 19:39.490
Sorry, but who is this
Leonardo Da Vinci,

19:39.514 --> 19:42.639
that I have to keep an eye on
the Island of Montecristo?

19:48.514 --> 19:51.514
A little boy? And then?

19:54.723 --> 19:59.532
I understand, I will receive
instructions with airmail!

20:01.639 --> 20:03.264
But...

20:04.181 --> 20:06.514
no, excuse me, nothing but.

20:07.723 --> 20:09.889
Let me go!

20:11.973 --> 20:13.681
And so we have guests!

20:16.639 --> 20:19.056
And what should we
do with you now?

20:21.306 --> 20:23.639
What do you want from me?
Let me go!

20:25.181 --> 20:30.431
You need goose paper and pen,
the kid has to write for me.

20:42.473 --> 20:44.740
Here it is, finally!

20:44.764 --> 20:46.824
Lisa? What are you doing here?

20:46.848 --> 20:48.907
Lorenzo told me everything.

20:48.931 --> 20:51.282
I'm sorry I was so hard.

20:51.306 --> 20:53.949
I'm coming with you to Florence.
I want to do something too.

20:53.973 --> 20:55.365
But...

20:55.389 --> 20:58.764
Do not worry, my parents agree.

20:59.514 --> 21:02.514
- Agree?
- Then we go?

21:02.973 --> 21:05.490
Oh! It goes... all
right, then...

21:05.514 --> 21:08.449
We have to wait for Lorenzo
to arrive too, though!

21:08.473 --> 21:11.032
Strange that has
not yet arrived.

21:11.056 --> 21:15.032
Lorenzo does not come. I found
this note on the door of my house.

21:15.056 --> 21:18.139
He says he has to go with his
father to the horse fair.

21:21.056 --> 21:24.598
Oh, no! This did not take!
All right, let's go.

21:25.973 --> 21:29.306
Hold on tight, the engine
is ready for departure!

21:40.181 --> 21:43.365
We should be there, the workshop
of the painter we are looking for

21:43.389 --> 21:45.181
it should be around the corner.

21:50.848 --> 21:54.389
Sorry, can you tell me if this is the
workshop of the painter Verrocchio?

21:55.889 --> 21:57.782
Yes, this is it.

21:57.806 --> 22:01.449
I have a letter for him. So I would
like to come and introduce myself.

22:01.473 --> 22:05.532
Oh, I'm sorry, boy, but
he left for Milan.

22:05.556 --> 22:06.973
He will be back in a month.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.282
And now what do we do?

22:09.306 --> 22:12.615
If you're an artist, why do not
you go to the market square?

22:12.639 --> 22:15.264
You might find some
interested merchant.

22:18.223 --> 22:20.865
Follow this road and you
will arrive in a moment.

22:20.889 --> 22:22.556
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:35.806 --> 22:40.824
Good morning, miss,
can I read your hand?

22:40.848 --> 22:43.407
- No thanks. I...
- Come on, guys,

22:43.431 --> 22:45.532
I have wonderful fried frogs!

22:45.556 --> 22:47.931
Why do not you try
a tasty apple?

22:49.556 --> 22:51.598
Run. I hate mice!

22:51.806 --> 22:53.806
- Watch!
- Taste!

22:56.431 --> 22:58.240
They are all crazy here!

22:58.264 --> 23:00.657
Look, that's the market
square down there.

23:00.681 --> 23:04.139
You will see that we have not gone all
this way for nothing. Here we go.

23:08.848 --> 23:11.615
Little thief! Take it!

23:11.639 --> 23:14.907
He stole an apple... I mean
an entire apple crate!

23:14.931 --> 23:17.115
Do not worry, I will
take care of it!

23:17.139 --> 23:20.365
Let her go, she only took
an apple that had fallen.

23:20.389 --> 23:22.556
The little girl will be hungry.
Come on let's go!

23:33.681 --> 23:36.032
Venghino gentlemen, Venghino!

23:36.056 --> 23:38.490
We are about to start the show.

23:38.514 --> 23:42.389
Please come closer, gentlemen!
And do not be afraid!

23:46.764 --> 23:49.556
Please, sit down, the
story is about to begin.

23:54.556 --> 23:58.449
This is a story of the sea that
starts from a distant country,

23:58.473 --> 24:00.889
from an island in the middle
of the great Indian sea.

24:01.598 --> 24:04.449
A ship sets sail in
the quiet quiet sea,

24:04.473 --> 24:07.157
but inside holds a secret.

24:07.181 --> 24:09.407
By sea he meets sea monsters,

24:09.431 --> 24:12.407
pirate ships and
killer corsairs.

24:12.431 --> 24:15.282
Fierce winds that fast spirans,

24:15.306 --> 24:17.657
trumpets that never end.

24:17.681 --> 24:20.615
But nothing can and
can never unveil

24:20.639 --> 24:23.740
the secret that the ship
carries in the sea.

24:23.764 --> 24:27.306
Do you want to give a move and tell
us what the ship was carrying?

24:32.973 --> 24:37.032
Un on the caracca a sad omen on
the great island was shipwrecked

24:45.931 --> 24:50.324
The submerged ship, be careful, is
under the stars of Sirius and Procyon.

24:55.139 --> 24:58.699
Ladies and gentlemen, just for today,
the original map of the shipwreck.

24:58.723 --> 25:00.740
Today I ruin myself, I
only ask you for a florin.

25:00.764 --> 25:03.639
I absolutely must have that map.

25:03.764 --> 25:06.264
But I only have half a florin.

25:11.931 --> 25:13.949
Unfortunately I only
have half a florin,

25:13.973 --> 25:16.723
but in exchange for the
map I can give you this.

25:20.223 --> 25:21.990
The doodle can hold it,

25:22.014 --> 25:24.907
I will still give you the
treasure map by half florin.

25:24.931 --> 25:27.389
You did a real deal, Leonardo.

25:29.473 --> 25:31.014
How do you know the name?

25:33.181 --> 25:36.264
Um, I saw your signature
in the drawing.

25:39.056 --> 25:40.723
Exact.

25:49.264 --> 25:50.949
- Here is the map.
- Thank you!

25:50.973 --> 25:52.639
Good luck!

25:56.473 --> 25:58.056
Hold on!

25:58.514 --> 26:01.365
We have the solution
to all our problems.

26:01.389 --> 26:03.657
- And what would it be?
- The map!

26:03.681 --> 26:05.889
That treasure really exists!

26:06.514 --> 26:09.806
When the storyteller spoke about
the ship, he called it "caracca".

26:10.473 --> 26:12.532
Ciacco told me that
a big caracca,

26:12.556 --> 26:16.348
returning from the Golden Indies,
he sank into the sea nearby.

26:16.598 --> 26:18.907
Does not this seem like
a strange coincidence?

26:18.931 --> 26:21.514
Are you sure? That storyteller
seems to me a charlatan.

26:21.931 --> 26:24.407
- Here we go?
- Yes we go.

26:24.431 --> 26:25.681
Jack!

26:34.556 --> 26:36.181
Here it is, it's there!

26:58.139 --> 27:02.514
If you want to see what's going
on up there, you should try this.

27:03.931 --> 27:06.931
- What is that?
- Look inside and you'll understand!

27:08.931 --> 27:11.240
But you can see
everything very far!

27:11.264 --> 27:12.889
You have to turn it!

27:31.306 --> 27:32.865
Oh!

27:51.764 --> 27:55.306
- Are you looking for this?
- Return it! It's mine!

27:57.973 --> 28:01.574
You will only get it if you take me
with you to look for the treasure!

28:01.598 --> 28:05.056
What do you think, Leo?
The girl is awake!

28:06.139 --> 28:11.181
All right, you'll come with us. See you
just before sunset at Ponte Vecchio.

28:11.931 --> 28:13.598
I'll be there!

28:14.223 --> 28:16.306
See to be on time!

28:20.681 --> 28:23.681
You did well, it can help us.

28:23.848 --> 28:26.490
Of course... and who is he?

28:26.514 --> 28:30.115
It is called Niccolò. With
this thing, observe the stars!

28:30.139 --> 28:32.532
Actually it's not a
thing, it's a spyglass,

28:32.556 --> 28:34.282
I need to study the stars.

28:34.306 --> 28:38.449
I know them almost all by heart and
I know where they are in the sky.

28:38.473 --> 28:42.032
So you also know where the
stars Sirius and Procyon are?

28:42.056 --> 28:43.532
Of course! They
are located in...

28:43.556 --> 28:46.681
No! Wait wait! He could
tell us tonight.

28:48.098 --> 28:50.098
Oh, Sirius and Procyon.

28:50.931 --> 28:53.324
What do you think, Nicholas,
do you want to come with us?

28:53.348 --> 28:55.949
From the sea the stars
are better seen.

28:55.973 --> 28:57.889
Really? Then we go!

29:03.723 --> 29:06.514
But Ponte Vecchio is over
there, what are we doing here?

29:06.973 --> 29:10.598
Oh, what a careless guy, I got confused!
What a pity!

29:11.181 --> 29:14.615
Now that impicciona
can not join us.

29:14.639 --> 29:16.181
Did you think you did it?

29:17.639 --> 29:19.181
Ah...

29:19.889 --> 29:22.223
Now that we're all
there, we can leave!

29:22.681 --> 29:24.449
She does not come!

29:24.473 --> 29:27.431
But you promised me that
I could come with you!

29:28.389 --> 29:31.389
Look, baby, can you
know what you want?

29:34.639 --> 29:37.407
- What are the ways?
- Agnes is alone in the world.

29:37.431 --> 29:41.699
Agnes also wanted to
have something to tell,

29:41.723 --> 29:44.865
a beautiful story of a
treasure and with new friends

29:44.889 --> 29:47.324
or rather, the first friends.

29:47.348 --> 29:49.723
Agnes has never had friends.

29:50.431 --> 29:53.723
Only for this Agnes
took the map.

29:55.056 --> 29:59.056
Please, let me come with you!
You promised me!

29:59.389 --> 30:02.639
Who do you think you are moving?
We do not even talk about it.

30:06.931 --> 30:09.764
Oh! All right, I
understand, let's go!

30:13.389 --> 30:15.407
I can not wait to get my
hands on the treasure!

30:15.431 --> 30:17.699
Why do you think the
treasure is still there?

30:17.723 --> 30:21.740
Remember what the storyteller said?
"Nobody saw him..."

30:21.764 --> 30:25.598
"Try searching now located in
the bottom of the sea." Yeah!

30:25.764 --> 30:28.865
Yes, I understand that
you remember it, Agnes.

30:28.889 --> 30:33.681
However, only me with my invention
can touch those depths.

30:34.806 --> 30:38.139
You will see, it will be a breeze!
Nothing can stop me!

30:39.348 --> 30:41.740
This junk does not go louder?

30:41.764 --> 30:43.639
Wait and see!

31:03.098 --> 31:04.806
Ready? Street!

31:05.723 --> 31:07.348
Oh!

31:11.848 --> 31:14.556
Maybe it was better before!

31:21.639 --> 31:24.014
I could not do it anymore.

31:42.431 --> 31:45.306
Island of Montecristo,
we arrive!

31:55.431 --> 31:57.824
I'm sorry! I was hungry!

31:57.848 --> 32:00.240
I only ate a traveler pigeon

32:00.264 --> 32:04.556
and do not forget that I was the
first hub of the Pirate Fly ship!

32:04.889 --> 32:09.449
You do not know it, but that pigeon
was the Pirate Fly's favorite pigeon!

32:09.473 --> 32:13.139
By eating it you signed
your death sentence.

32:14.139 --> 32:15.764
Oh!

32:22.931 --> 32:24.889
Here they are!
They are arriving!

32:26.473 --> 32:28.098
Finally!

32:28.889 --> 32:31.889
Lower the sails and
switch off the lanterns!

32:32.514 --> 32:34.806
In fact, we must not show up.

32:38.139 --> 32:39.598
Ah!

32:40.639 --> 32:43.098
Move, bunch of inept!

32:43.598 --> 32:46.157
But will not it be dangerous
to turn off all the lanterns?

32:46.181 --> 32:49.449
Be quiet, coward, for years
I've been sailing in the dark

32:49.473 --> 32:51.723
and nothing has ever happened.

32:52.723 --> 32:54.181
Nothing happened!

33:00.723 --> 33:04.824
At sunrise we will begin to
spy on Leo and his friends.

33:04.848 --> 33:09.949
I'm really curious to see this
Leonardo Da Vinci at work!

33:09.973 --> 33:12.115
Killer! Take me to
the Black Wing.

33:12.139 --> 33:14.514
Power! I have to warn Fly.

33:31.056 --> 33:33.574
This is the map we
found in Florence.

33:33.598 --> 33:36.157
The treasure should be in the
sea in front of the island,

33:36.181 --> 33:38.865
under the stars of
Sirius and Caprone.

33:38.889 --> 33:40.556
LISA RIDE

33:42.931 --> 33:45.723
Sirius and Procyon, not
Sirius and Caprone!

33:49.181 --> 33:50.806
Let me see.

33:59.431 --> 34:03.306
I think the position on the card
is correct, everything matches,

34:03.806 --> 34:06.949
above are the stars of Sirius
and Procyon in a straight line.

34:06.973 --> 34:09.449
Maybe there really could
be under the treasure,

34:09.473 --> 34:10.864
and tomorrow we will try.

34:10.889 --> 34:14.324
Tomorrow? I forgot to tell
you something important!

34:14.348 --> 34:17.407
- Tomorrow there is the solar eclipse!
- And go!

34:17.431 --> 34:20.864
I have to ask you a question:
what would this solar eclipse be?

34:20.889 --> 34:22.556
You do not know?

34:23.723 --> 34:27.514
I will be brief. "Eclipse" derives
from the Greek and means "to hide"...

34:32.139 --> 34:33.532
and as I said half an hour ago,

34:33.556 --> 34:36.489
this happens only when the three
celestial bodies are aligned.

34:36.514 --> 34:38.056
Yes, but what really happens?

34:39.473 --> 34:43.514
Um, so let's pretend
the fire is the sun.

34:44.681 --> 34:46.864
This is the Moon and
this is the Earth.

34:46.889 --> 34:49.032
When the moon is placed
between the Sun and the Earth

34:49.056 --> 34:52.016
we have an eclipse and the Sun goes dark.
And the eclipse will be tomorrow.

34:54.806 --> 34:57.114
- Guys?
- Come on, come to sleep!

34:57.139 --> 34:59.098
But I was not finished yet!

35:14.056 --> 35:17.598
Leo has arrived at the
island, we're on him.

35:18.264 --> 35:23.723
Very well, now all that remains is to
wait and the casket will be in my hands.

35:24.264 --> 35:27.056
The Pirate Fly can wait.

35:57.264 --> 35:59.199
Come on, hurry up, my friend.

35:59.223 --> 36:02.098
I understand that the wheat is better,
but the rope is not bad either.

36:05.639 --> 36:07.264
Thanks babe!

36:10.889 --> 36:12.848
Pig! Pig!

36:16.389 --> 36:17.931
Pig!

36:19.306 --> 36:21.615
Who is it? Who is it?
What happens?

36:21.639 --> 36:26.098
It's me, Lorenzo, you will not believe it.
I was kidnapped by pirates!

36:26.639 --> 36:29.407
From the pirates? Do not joke!

36:29.431 --> 36:32.115
And I think Leo is in danger too.
Did you see it?

36:32.139 --> 36:36.324
The pirates said they are keeping an
eye on the island of Montecristo!

36:36.348 --> 36:40.074
The island of Montecristo,
are you sure you heard well?

36:40.098 --> 36:41.723
Yes sure!

36:43.014 --> 36:47.223
Then we just have to leave with my
boat and understand what is happening.

37:11.889 --> 37:13.824
What are you watching, Leo?

37:13.848 --> 37:16.157
If you want, I can
lend you my spyglass.

37:16.181 --> 37:19.865
No need, thanks. I also see
well with the naked eye!

37:19.889 --> 37:23.098
And this year the sympathy
award goes to Leonardo!

37:25.764 --> 37:27.907
Can I look, if you do not mind?

37:27.931 --> 37:30.848
Of course you can, Miss Agnes!

37:36.098 --> 37:37.556
And what's that?

37:38.014 --> 37:40.014
Thing? Come here!

37:45.598 --> 37:47.223
Hold on!

37:59.681 --> 38:01.848
Come and see, come on, quick!

38:13.806 --> 38:15.699
He got too close to the shore.

38:15.723 --> 38:18.449
These nets are dangerous,
he got entangled.

38:18.473 --> 38:19.723
But where did he go?

38:20.514 --> 38:22.139
He's back, Leo!

38:23.806 --> 38:26.240
Hi how are you, all right?

38:26.264 --> 38:28.223
VERSES OF THE DOLPHIN

38:43.056 --> 38:44.782
For me?

38:44.806 --> 38:46.723
Oh, thank you, Mr. Dolphin.

38:53.598 --> 38:56.181
But this is an ancient necklace!

38:56.598 --> 39:00.473
It means that the treasure is there
and it is close! I will find it!

39:25.848 --> 39:27.514
Burp

41:05.348 --> 41:06.973
Oh!

41:44.806 --> 41:46.473
Ah!

41:49.431 --> 41:51.056
Ah!

42:45.889 --> 42:48.699
- So?
- And then I was right.

42:48.723 --> 42:50.889
- The ship is there.
- Hurray!

42:51.473 --> 42:53.598
Only that unfortunately...

42:55.473 --> 42:57.098
it's empty!

42:57.473 --> 42:59.098
Empty?

42:59.264 --> 43:02.115
The story is this: someone
attacked the ship,

43:02.139 --> 43:07.824
he took the treasure and then
disappeared to some distant island.

43:07.848 --> 43:10.324
- And now what do we do?
- I have to think about it.

43:10.348 --> 43:12.223
I need to reflect.

43:18.264 --> 43:22.949
When the boss knows the bad news,
he will get angry like a snake!

43:22.973 --> 43:26.615
I've been a pirate for years and
I've never seen an angry snake!

43:26.639 --> 43:28.264
Never seen one!

43:29.681 --> 43:31.240
Ah!

43:31.264 --> 43:32.764
Help!

43:34.056 --> 43:35.598
Help!

43:36.973 --> 43:38.848
Angry snakes!

43:42.931 --> 43:44.598
But how can it be?

43:45.264 --> 43:46.990
Are you sure of what you say?

43:47.014 --> 43:51.449
The little guy found the ship submerged,
but inside there was nothing.

43:51.473 --> 43:53.681
Ah! Fly will not be happy!

43:54.639 --> 43:57.657
- Go check the wreck!
- How are we doing?

43:57.681 --> 44:01.115
The boy had a kind of suit
with a tube to breathe.

44:01.139 --> 44:04.056
Build two equal, quick!

44:18.306 --> 44:21.907
We must hurry if we do not
want to take a thunderbolt.

44:21.931 --> 44:24.473
I've been going by sea for
years and I've never taken...

44:27.098 --> 44:28.723
a lightning!

44:29.098 --> 44:30.848
It would take some water.

44:33.348 --> 44:34.556
Even less!

44:40.598 --> 44:42.657
We only needed the rain!

44:42.681 --> 44:45.032
What is all this
fear of the rain?

44:45.056 --> 44:47.657
Where I live I fall a
lot and with my friends

44:47.681 --> 44:50.514
we have fun running and
jumping in the puddles!

44:58.348 --> 45:00.990
- Oh!
- Since you like it so much,

45:01.014 --> 45:03.615
is not that you're going to
check that Botte is safe?

45:03.639 --> 45:05.699
Because with this
time you never know.

45:05.723 --> 45:07.824
But Leo, I do not think that's
the case, it's raining!

45:07.848 --> 45:10.907
Of course. Do not worry, Lisa,
I'll check that Botte is safe.

45:10.931 --> 45:13.740
I go immediately,
count on me too!

45:13.764 --> 45:15.907
Botte is not that way.

45:15.931 --> 45:18.348
I understand, I'm
going with him too!

45:30.889 --> 45:33.181
Well, it stopped raining!

45:34.431 --> 45:36.306
Something wrong, Lisa?

45:37.139 --> 45:39.574
- Nothing.
- Like anything?

45:39.598 --> 45:41.949
Is there something
you did not tell me?

45:41.973 --> 45:44.199
I believe you could
not understand.

45:44.223 --> 45:47.598
Unlikely, I usually understand
everything the first time.

45:51.764 --> 45:56.056
No, no, sorry. I just wanted to say
that I'm glad to hear from you!

45:57.973 --> 46:00.824
Who knows where I lost
Lisa's handkerchief?

46:00.848 --> 46:02.514
Ah, here it is!

46:02.681 --> 46:05.098
You know, Leo, I did not
tell you everything.

46:06.431 --> 46:10.973
My father's problems, after the fire,
are more serious than I imagined.

46:11.764 --> 46:13.615
I heard him say the other night

46:13.639 --> 46:17.889
that if you do not find the money to
pay, we will lose everything we have.

46:18.639 --> 46:20.973
- Unless...
- Unless?

46:21.598 --> 46:22.848
Yes, unless?

46:23.806 --> 46:27.223
Unless I do not marry the
Marquis of Montescuro!

46:28.306 --> 46:31.223
Thing? To that stuffed dandy?

46:34.139 --> 46:36.223
Oh, Lisa, I do not want to...

46:52.598 --> 46:53.764
Ouch!

46:55.139 --> 46:57.681
Why do not you look
where you're going?

47:00.014 --> 47:02.598
Guys, there's something
you should see!

47:08.848 --> 47:11.348
- Pirates?
- Oh, no! And now?

47:28.931 --> 47:31.240
But how does this thing go down?

47:31.264 --> 47:32.990
Without the boulders
to make us heavy

47:33.014 --> 47:35.157
we will stand still
like two cork stoppers.

47:35.181 --> 47:37.223
For a thousand
herrings, a shark!

47:38.723 --> 47:41.473
Help! Killer, save us!

47:46.306 --> 47:47.931
Oh!

48:01.889 --> 48:03.824
And where did they come from?

48:03.848 --> 48:06.223
Incredible, real pirates!

48:09.473 --> 48:12.199
I'm definitely here
for the treasure.

48:12.223 --> 48:14.824
But they will have a
bad disappointment.

48:14.848 --> 48:17.389
What if they knew
something more about us?

48:19.389 --> 48:21.532
You are right. Ciacco
explained to me

48:21.556 --> 48:24.115
that the pirates pass on
their secrets to each other.

48:24.139 --> 48:27.240
Let's try to find out what they know!
What have we got to lose?

48:27.264 --> 48:28.889
In fact.

48:29.098 --> 48:32.574
But yes, I agree, we must find
where they have moored the ship!

48:32.598 --> 48:35.973
But we must be cautious. Wait
for the right time and...

48:38.223 --> 48:41.348
Leo, wait for me!
I'm coming too!

48:43.264 --> 48:46.490
- Are we going to hunt for pirates?
- First, snack.

48:46.514 --> 48:50.431
Gladly, Miss Agnes, I'm
hungry for a sea lion!

48:54.389 --> 48:55.806
Here they are.

48:58.848 --> 49:00.490
Do we get on board?

49:00.514 --> 49:03.865
Of course, so... what
have we got to lose?

49:03.889 --> 49:06.574
Come on, get ready,
swim at sunset!

49:06.598 --> 49:09.389
Organize guard shifts.

49:19.098 --> 49:20.889
Prepare the pigeons, Francis!

49:21.723 --> 49:25.532
In your opinion, what are the
pigeons doing on board a ship?

49:25.556 --> 49:27.098
- I have no idea!
- Let's find out!

49:48.848 --> 49:51.473
Finally you found them!

49:55.806 --> 49:59.098
Pigeons, but of course!

50:01.306 --> 50:02.931
Lisa, look:

50:03.098 --> 50:06.115
"Bad news, the ship is empty
and the treasure is not there.

50:06.139 --> 50:08.699
The brats have surrendered.
We await new orders."

50:08.723 --> 50:10.824
But then they are spying on us!

50:10.848 --> 50:13.723
Brats? But how do you
allow us to call...

50:24.889 --> 50:28.407
The crew of incapable, they
did not send the message.

50:28.431 --> 50:30.306
Fly can not wait!

50:56.973 --> 50:59.473
<So hurry up, Black Wing?

51:17.681 --> 51:21.824
I can not figure out where
the damn treasure ended up.

51:21.848 --> 51:24.306
That's enough! It must be there!

51:33.389 --> 51:35.014
Ah!

51:47.598 --> 51:49.223
But what...

51:49.514 --> 51:51.556
Oh! A mouse on my ship?

52:14.806 --> 52:16.473
Oh yes?

52:22.306 --> 52:24.240
Someone jumped into the sea!

52:24.264 --> 52:27.181
Do not worry, it's
just a barrel.

52:28.681 --> 52:31.973
Who knows why a barrel
is thrown into the sea?

52:37.764 --> 52:41.282
The pirates are spying on us and
sending information to someone.

52:41.306 --> 52:43.139
And now what do we do?

52:43.806 --> 52:45.990
Meanwhile, let's take
a breath and then...

52:46.014 --> 52:50.139
Leo, you have to do something. I do
not want to marry that mammalucco.

52:51.514 --> 52:55.264
You must not be afraid.
Here I am! I got it?

53:59.098 --> 54:01.639
Go, go, yes!

54:30.931 --> 54:32.681
Now I get it!

54:33.098 --> 54:34.740
Wake up, wake up!

54:34.764 --> 54:37.431
- Who is it? What happen?
- Come out, I'll explain!

54:39.848 --> 54:42.806
- I saw two rudders underwater!
- Yes and then?

54:43.514 --> 54:45.139
But how, do not you understand?

54:46.514 --> 54:48.639
Two rudders means two ships!

54:49.806 --> 54:52.365
You did not wake us
up for this, I hope.

54:52.389 --> 54:55.407
Wait, Leo is right, if
there are two rudders,

54:55.431 --> 54:58.532
then even the ship that took the
treasure is shipwrecked nearby.

54:58.556 --> 55:02.699
Yes, come on, too beautiful, the
ship is below, the treasure is near.

55:02.723 --> 55:05.973
I'm having too much fun, I
knew I had to come with you.

55:08.264 --> 55:10.431
Agnes is going back to bed now.

55:11.723 --> 55:15.056
Let them sleep, we'll go
look for the other ship.

55:26.098 --> 55:27.723
Why are not you sleeping?

55:29.598 --> 55:31.973
- I'm worried.
- Because?

55:32.473 --> 55:35.824
Because I'm afraid Leo will never
find the treasure and Lisa...

55:35.848 --> 55:37.639
Thing? Lisa what?

55:38.223 --> 55:40.639
It's a long story, follow me!

55:41.139 --> 55:44.223
Yesterday, when I came back
to the cave, I heard Lisa...

55:46.389 --> 55:49.931
In short, to conclude,
Lisa must marry.

55:50.556 --> 55:52.449
This is all I know.

55:52.473 --> 55:55.556
Poverina, now I
understand many things.

55:57.723 --> 56:01.098
- If only we could help her!
- Of course.

56:01.556 --> 56:05.115
- The Pirates!
- No, the pirates! Come on, let's hide!

56:05.139 --> 56:08.473
Agnes, wait, I have a plan.
Follow me!

56:10.598 --> 56:13.824
You realize? On this island
there is a pirate ship,

56:13.848 --> 56:17.824
- and what's in pirate ships?
- The hold.

56:17.848 --> 56:20.407
And what are the holds
of pirate ships full of?

56:20.431 --> 56:22.449
- Here...
- Of gold and precious gems.

56:22.473 --> 56:24.990
We build a raft, get
on board and...

56:25.014 --> 56:28.324
- And the pirates capture us right away.
- Exactly!

56:28.348 --> 56:30.431
- This is the plan!
- Oh!

56:31.973 --> 56:33.889
Leo took the anchor off.

56:35.264 --> 56:38.740
Good. Fly wrote us to
wait and was right.

56:38.764 --> 56:41.490
Hey! - Research is
not finished yet.

56:41.514 --> 56:43.139
Hey!

56:44.473 --> 56:46.973
- Pirates!
- Sssssh... talk softly.

56:50.514 --> 56:52.223
Issue them on board.

56:55.598 --> 56:57.782
What were we saying?

56:57.806 --> 57:01.973
I was saying that I am a
great magician from Poland.

57:03.973 --> 57:07.115
A great magician high
as a penny of cheese.

57:07.139 --> 57:10.074
If you do not leave
immediately from this island,

57:10.098 --> 57:13.574
when I clap my hands
the sun will darken.

57:13.598 --> 57:17.889
How do you beat your hands if
you are tied like a salami?

57:18.098 --> 57:20.949
If you do not leave the search
for treasure immediately,

57:20.973 --> 57:23.657
when I speak the language,
the sun will darken.

57:23.681 --> 57:28.074
Careful, kid, I could decide
to cut off the tongue!

57:28.098 --> 57:29.723
Capto?

57:31.098 --> 57:34.889
At the crack of my tongue
the sun disappears!

57:43.806 --> 57:46.723
- Are you sure?
- Very sure.

57:50.098 --> 57:52.848
In short, sun, do you
want to disappear?

59:01.348 --> 59:03.598
Lisa! Lisa!

59:06.098 --> 59:08.973
I'm here! Meet me!

59:13.223 --> 59:15.306
And now where do they go?

59:25.264 --> 59:27.723
But that's... it's...

59:31.973 --> 59:34.740
Lisa, it's the first
time you're speechless.

59:34.764 --> 59:38.115
No doubt, this is the
ship we are looking for.

59:38.139 --> 59:39.865
This means that...

59:39.889 --> 59:42.473
That now the treasure is ours!

59:49.306 --> 59:53.223
Careful, this ship is very old,
it's been here for a long time.

59:53.514 --> 59:55.473
It may be dangerous.

59:59.639 --> 01:00:02.431
I'm going to see
what's underneath.

01:00:12.056 --> 01:00:13.723
Ah!

01:00:16.098 --> 01:00:17.723
Ah!

01:00:22.973 --> 01:00:24.639
Ah!

01:00:45.598 --> 01:00:47.657
<Where did you go?

01:00:47.681 --> 01:00:50.681
This way, Leo. Come, hurry up.

01:00:53.723 --> 01:00:55.389
We found it.

01:00:55.723 --> 01:00:58.598
We just need to understand
how it opens up.

01:01:03.889 --> 01:01:06.306
Give me a hand, let's
bring the chest out.

01:01:08.389 --> 01:01:11.598
Be careful where you put your feet.
You will not want to fall again!

01:01:13.306 --> 01:01:14.931
You were saying?

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:35.389
Ah!

01:01:39.889 --> 01:01:42.723
Recover the treasure,
belongs to Fly!

01:01:52.389 --> 01:01:54.240
- Are you OK?
- Yes, yes.

01:01:54.264 --> 01:01:55.598
Oh, no!

01:02:03.306 --> 01:02:08.098
Francis, open the box immediately.
I want to see the treasure.

01:02:13.098 --> 01:02:15.615
Then? What are you waiting for?

01:02:15.639 --> 01:02:18.473
But this chest has no opening.

01:02:19.181 --> 01:02:22.199
Let it jump with a cannon shot!

01:02:22.223 --> 01:02:25.098
Indeed no, I have a better idea.

01:02:25.431 --> 01:02:28.681
Cicada! Give me the note.
Come with me.

01:02:29.639 --> 01:02:31.264
Din!

01:02:32.598 --> 01:02:34.282
Ah!

01:02:49.473 --> 01:02:51.098
Ah!

01:02:51.681 --> 01:02:53.949
- Agnes?
- Niccolò?

01:02:53.973 --> 01:02:55.639
Oh, no!

01:02:57.181 --> 01:03:00.764
Something tells me that
genius has taken the bait.

01:03:10.473 --> 01:03:12.473
Prepare the prisoners.

01:03:17.264 --> 01:03:20.490
Did not your mother teach you that
you do not play with a knife?

01:03:20.514 --> 01:03:22.657
Sir, what do you plan to do?

01:03:22.681 --> 01:03:24.098
Ah!

01:03:31.223 --> 01:03:34.824
And now jump. I count up to
three and then a nice dive.

01:03:34.848 --> 01:03:36.615
One two...

01:03:36.639 --> 01:03:38.282
One moment!

01:03:38.306 --> 01:03:40.407
Look see who we have here.

01:03:40.431 --> 01:03:44.324
If you release Agnes and
Niccolò and let them go,

01:03:44.348 --> 01:03:48.532
then I'll show you how it opens.
Take or leave.

01:03:48.556 --> 01:03:53.199
Actually, I do not think you are in
a position to dictate conditions.

01:03:53.223 --> 01:03:54.824
No, stop!

01:03:54.848 --> 01:03:56.514
Let's do like this.

01:03:56.764 --> 01:04:00.032
First you open the box and
then the boys will be free.

01:04:00.056 --> 01:04:02.324
And be it! Then
do as I tell you.

01:04:02.348 --> 01:04:05.598
Raise the treasure
chest outboard.

01:04:16.181 --> 01:04:18.431
First I need a knife.

01:04:24.931 --> 01:04:28.449
If someone makes a false
move, Lisa will cut the rope

01:04:28.473 --> 01:04:31.657
and the treasure will
be fed to the sharks.

01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:33.806
Now, get me some fish.

01:04:44.806 --> 01:04:47.074
We need other fish.

01:04:47.098 --> 01:04:50.365
Brat, you're not
fooling us, are you?

01:04:50.389 --> 01:04:53.824
Do not worry, I know what I do.
Look at the case.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:55.782
- What do you see?
- Of the nails!

01:04:55.806 --> 01:04:59.365
Of the dolphins, there are depicted
dolphins coming out of the water.

01:04:59.389 --> 01:05:02.973
- It is an acoustic opening box.
- Acoustics?

01:05:03.306 --> 01:05:05.865
It only opens with the verse
issued by the dolphins.

01:05:05.889 --> 01:05:09.431
Do not be silly! It will
never open like this!

01:05:16.431 --> 01:05:20.407
We are rich! Doing business
with you is a real pleasure.

01:05:20.431 --> 01:05:23.074
Thank you for your
kind cooperation.

01:05:23.098 --> 01:05:25.032
And now. Get them all out!

01:05:25.056 --> 01:05:26.806
Cut the rope, Lisa!

01:05:30.639 --> 01:05:31.865
I can not believe!

01:05:31.889 --> 01:05:35.782
It is not yet born who can put
the Pirate Fly crew in the bag!

01:05:35.806 --> 01:05:38.449
Certainly not you. Take them!

01:05:38.473 --> 01:05:40.264
Lisa, dive into the water!

01:05:45.723 --> 01:05:49.365
I wonder if the sharks
will become smarter

01:05:49.389 --> 01:05:51.532
after having eaten a genius!

01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:55.514
- You, recover the chest with the treasure!
- Now, boss!

01:06:01.681 --> 01:06:03.532
Shoot the brat, hurry up!

01:06:08.806 --> 01:06:12.074
Free them, and then I will
bring back the treasure!

01:06:18.431 --> 01:06:21.098
Chase him, he can not Go far!

01:06:22.723 --> 01:06:27.348
They are reaching me, I have
to come up with something!

01:06:33.931 --> 01:06:37.324
The kid wants to play,
well, load the cannons!

01:06:37.348 --> 01:06:38.907
No!

01:06:38.931 --> 01:06:41.556
We must be able to stop it!
Fire!

01:06:48.348 --> 01:06:53.139
Leo, please, bring back the treasure
here, it's the only solution.

01:06:54.973 --> 01:06:57.824
- I'll never do it!
- Do not be stupid.

01:06:57.848 --> 01:06:59.681
I do not want to lose you!

01:07:01.723 --> 01:07:03.574
Enough, little talk.

01:07:03.598 --> 01:07:07.199
As soon as the treasure has been
recovered it will be over for you!

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:10.848
Thing? What do you want to do?

01:07:11.848 --> 01:07:15.574
No! Our treasure has been lost!

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:17.431
Hit him!

01:08:14.181 --> 01:08:16.555
Leo!

01:08:48.139 --> 01:08:49.805
How is it possible?

01:08:52.098 --> 01:08:54.615
Now enough, Leo,
you got me tired!

01:08:54.639 --> 01:08:56.615
Francis, point the cannon
on the boy, come on!

01:08:56.639 --> 01:08:59.073
If you're wrong, it
can happen that...

01:08:59.098 --> 01:09:02.389
Be quiet, coward,
I'm never wrong.

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:20.555
For someone who never makes a
mistake, you made a nice hole, eh!

01:09:21.639 --> 01:09:23.889
Agnes, hold your breath.

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:32.014
Hey, guys, are you ready to fly?

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.805
Come on, go up!

01:09:38.305 --> 01:09:41.782
Good for nothing, give me
a hand to plug the leak.

01:09:41.805 --> 01:09:44.889
We are too heavy, we will rush!

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:48.389
Look over there,
we ask for help!

01:09:50.473 --> 01:09:53.598
My mother apple had said
I had to be a plumber.

01:09:57.723 --> 01:09:59.889
Regendevi forte!

01:10:06.931 --> 01:10:08.490
- Ciacco?
- Leo?

01:10:08.514 --> 01:10:09.990
- Lorenzo?
- Lisa?

01:10:10.014 --> 01:10:11.931
- Niccolò!
- Agnes!

01:10:12.139 --> 01:10:14.990
How are you? What happened?
You look fine?

01:10:15.014 --> 01:10:17.199
- We were followed by pirates!
- We were taken prisoner!

01:10:17.223 --> 01:10:19.473
Then we found the treasure,
but the pirates...

01:10:19.723 --> 01:10:21.389
- The treasure?
- The Pirates?

01:10:22.723 --> 01:10:25.157
They are not going very well.

01:10:25.181 --> 01:10:29.514
Pull them on board, they will pay
for what they did to my friend Leo.

01:10:32.973 --> 01:10:34.639
Tell me about the treasure!

01:10:35.806 --> 01:10:38.782
Unfortunately it ended up
at the bottom of the sea...

01:10:38.806 --> 01:10:41.056
but I saved a part of it!

01:10:41.806 --> 01:10:43.473
Very well, Leo!

01:10:48.764 --> 01:10:50.431
Seize them!

01:10:56.139 --> 01:11:00.657
Did you really not get there, Leo? You
really did not understand that...

01:11:00.681 --> 01:11:03.199
Am I the true leader
of the pirates?

01:11:03.223 --> 01:11:07.806
I am the famous Pirate Fly!

01:11:11.389 --> 01:11:13.032
All ready, sir!

01:11:13.056 --> 01:11:15.324
But that's the
market storytellers!

01:11:15.348 --> 01:11:17.657
- This means...
- Exactly!

01:11:17.681 --> 01:11:20.157
They were all pirates
at my service.

01:11:20.181 --> 01:11:22.157
I organized everything myself.

01:11:22.181 --> 01:11:25.574
I spied while you were immersed
in the lake with the diving suit.

01:11:25.598 --> 01:11:29.199
I knew you were the only one who could
recover the treasure under water.

01:11:29.223 --> 01:11:31.729
You do not want to tell
me that you also set

01:11:31.753 --> 01:11:34.282
fire to the fields and
the barn of Lisa?

01:11:34.306 --> 01:11:37.681
Bravo, do you see that if you commit
yourself you will arrive by yourself?

01:11:40.556 --> 01:11:41.907
How could you?

01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:44.699
As soon as I can free
myself, I'll show you.

01:11:44.723 --> 01:11:47.032
Bla, bla, bla.

01:11:47.056 --> 01:11:51.365
Quiet, now give me the treasure
and we end this farce.

01:11:51.389 --> 01:11:55.139
Even if for you, the happy
ending is not expected.

01:11:55.931 --> 01:11:57.990
There is a small problem.

01:11:58.014 --> 01:12:01.782
If you only think of touching
the treasure with a finger,

01:12:01.806 --> 01:12:06.115
the darkness will fall over the whole earth
and all of us will burn and become ashes.

01:12:06.139 --> 01:12:08.532
Still with this
story, little guy?

01:12:08.556 --> 01:12:11.490
The kid got us stupid,

01:12:11.514 --> 01:12:14.556
but we are not stupid,
do you, Francis?

01:12:16.931 --> 01:12:18.949
Ah! He was right.

01:12:18.973 --> 01:12:21.407
The end of the
world has arrived!

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:33.806
Fermi, suckers, it's
just an eclipse!

01:12:39.389 --> 01:12:40.907
So what do you say?

01:12:40.931 --> 01:12:43.907
I redid the eclipse calculations
and this time they were exact.

01:12:43.931 --> 01:12:46.806
- We go back home!
- Yes, and let's hurry up!

01:12:48.389 --> 01:12:50.014
Be careful!

01:12:51.181 --> 01:12:52.949
Come on, brat!

01:12:52.973 --> 01:12:54.639
Brat to me?

01:13:07.181 --> 01:13:08.907
Bada!

01:13:08.931 --> 01:13:10.598
Where are you, marrano?

01:13:22.348 --> 01:13:23.973
Oh!

01:13:58.639 --> 01:14:01.240
Do you think you're the
only one who can fly?

01:14:01.264 --> 01:14:02.889
Come on, Lorenzo!

01:14:07.681 --> 01:14:08.889
But what...

01:14:14.264 --> 01:14:15.889
Ah!

01:14:23.973 --> 01:14:28.431
Do not worry, captain, it's just a
harmless dolphin we already know.

01:14:44.473 --> 01:14:46.324
Here, this spyglass is for you.

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:48.473
Thank you! And this
design is for you!

01:14:49.973 --> 01:14:52.074
But I do not have four arms.

01:14:52.098 --> 01:14:54.764
Drawings really bad, you
should practice more!

01:14:55.389 --> 01:14:58.157
All right, thanks for
the advice, I'll try.

01:14:58.181 --> 01:14:59.598
So goodbye!

01:15:08.473 --> 01:15:10.699
Agnes, do not you say hello?

01:15:10.723 --> 01:15:12.389
Yes. Hello, bye.

01:15:23.348 --> 01:15:25.431
Do not get used to it!

01:15:27.014 --> 01:15:29.223
Goodbye!

01:15:34.014 --> 01:15:35.806
- Lisa?
- Dad!

01:15:36.639 --> 01:15:38.865
I was afraid of never
seeing you again,

01:15:38.889 --> 01:15:40.931
and that I had
disappeared due...

01:15:41.973 --> 01:15:44.639
of the Marquis of Montescuro.

01:15:54.723 --> 01:15:57.014
We came to get...

01:15:58.848 --> 01:16:01.365
- Lisa.
- Ah yes, Lisa.

01:16:01.389 --> 01:16:04.681
Yes, I can not
wait to marry her.

01:16:05.639 --> 01:16:08.324
What if we could pay the debt?

01:16:08.348 --> 01:16:11.014
Because? Do you have
three pounds of gold?

01:16:11.639 --> 01:16:16.139
If you have three pounds
of gold, I'll eat my hat.

01:16:16.973 --> 01:16:21.681
These are four pounds!
Keep the rest, sir.

01:16:29.431 --> 01:16:32.598
Remember the hat and
enjoy your meal.

01:16:38.014 --> 01:16:41.365
Excuse me, where did you
find all that gold?

01:16:41.389 --> 01:16:43.014
IS...

01:16:43.473 --> 01:16:46.181
It's a long story,
give me a minute.

01:16:49.473 --> 01:16:52.365
- Where are you going?
- I go home.

01:16:52.389 --> 01:16:56.389
I mean, I'm going somewhere.
I will find a place to go.

01:16:56.848 --> 01:17:01.282
Agnes, I know you do not
care, but we need help

01:17:01.306 --> 01:17:03.449
to rebuild the farm.

01:17:03.473 --> 01:17:05.782
You can stay here
with us, if you like.

01:17:05.806 --> 01:17:07.473
What do you say?

01:17:08.139 --> 01:17:11.639
But, I do not know, if
you really need me...

01:17:13.514 --> 01:17:15.931
I believe I could also stay.

01:17:18.889 --> 01:17:21.306
Gentlemen, lunch is served.

01:17:41.639 --> 01:17:43.032
Thanks, Leo.

01:17:43.056 --> 01:17:46.157
Without you I do not know
what could have happened.

01:17:46.181 --> 01:17:47.949
We were a great team.

01:17:47.973 --> 01:17:51.365
Now that I no longer have
to leave to get married,

01:17:51.389 --> 01:17:53.490
we will remain friends forever.

01:17:53.514 --> 01:17:56.115
Friends forever?

01:17:56.139 --> 01:17:59.407
But how, have not
you told him yet?

01:17:59.431 --> 01:18:01.282
Said what?

01:18:01.306 --> 01:18:04.115
Er... yes, so here it
is, the fact is...

01:18:04.139 --> 01:18:06.389
In short, what I wanted
to say is that...

01:18:09.639 --> 01:18:14.931
Leo, you will also be a genius, but for
some things you still have much to learn.
