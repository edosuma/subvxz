( Honking )

00:06.674 --> 00:08.307
Come on!

00:08.309 --> 00:09.309
Come on!

00:09.310 --> 00:10.642
Go now.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.244
( Honking )

00:12.246 --> 00:15.147
Hold it.
Hold it.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.752
That's it.
Yeah, that's what you get!

00:21.288 --> 00:22.788
Unbelievable.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.189
Stop, stop, stop!

00:24.191 --> 00:25.357
Hey, buddy!

00:25.381 --> 00:27.381
( Tires screech )

00:30.362 --> 00:31.331
You're an idiot!

00:32.220 --> 00:33.265
Jeez, <i>that</i> was close.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.333
( Growling )

00:34.335 --> 00:36.035
Whoa!

00:39.740 --> 00:41.807
Whoa.

00:41.809 --> 00:45.077
No, please, stop! Stop!

00:54.622 --> 00:56.822
Man: Stay clear on that side!

01:10.471 --> 01:12.604
We saw the car
just down there.

01:14.375 --> 01:19.378
( Electricity crackles )

01:19.380 --> 01:20.379
Never going to get
used to that.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.181
I know. Right?

01:22.183 --> 01:25.751
Investigating a traffic accident
in Bumblefart, Washington.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.753
Excellent use of
my criminal genius.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.455
The clippings book
showed us an article

01:29.457 --> 01:31.323
about a truck crash
in Bremen--

01:31.325 --> 01:33.492
Well, we're in Bremen.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.160
Right, so any idea how you're
going to talk to these people?

01:35.162 --> 01:36.762
Because I don't think you
can keep flashing

01:36.764 --> 01:38.497
your counter-terrorism badge
and I don't think

01:38.499 --> 01:40.866
we can walk up and go,
"Hey, we're from the library".

01:40.868 --> 01:43.268
Um, well on TV shows,
the Supernatural detectives,

01:43.270 --> 01:46.238
they always tell people that weird stuff
was caused by swamp gas.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.607
That's UFOs, not magic.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.175
Excuse me, Sheriff Hiyer.

01:50.177 --> 01:54.413
Actually, it's Heyer.
Like, "hey!" Er.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.548
Uh, hi.
I'm Eve Baird.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.484
We spoke on the phone.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.853
Right, right.
Nice to meet you.

02:00.855 --> 02:04.323
So what was it you said
you were here for again?

02:07.328 --> 02:12.297
We're from the, uh,
Metropolitan Library.

02:12.299 --> 02:16.502
And we're doing a
"traffic flow study".

02:16.504 --> 02:19.505
Conducting and collating
accident reports

02:19.507 --> 02:25.144
and statistical surveys
on rural stuff.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.880
Well, uh, it wasn't
no traffic flow issue.

02:27.882 --> 02:31.350
The way I see it, the truck
driver was driving too fast,

02:31.352 --> 02:32.851
trying to pass a car,
swerved to avoid

02:32.853 --> 02:34.620
oncoming traffic and then

02:34.622 --> 02:37.322
( makes sound effects )

02:37.324 --> 02:41.193
Fellow was darned lucky
he survived with scrapes and bruises.

02:41.195 --> 02:44.863
See? Quaint explanation
for a quaint place.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.265
Quaint?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.667
Yeah, it means small.
Boring. You know.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.402
I know what the word means.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.838
I'm just trying to decipher
what you mean by it.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.940
You with this
library, son?

02:54.942 --> 02:57.342
Oh, look, there's the truck.
Mind if we take a peek?

02:57.344 --> 02:58.911
- Right there.
- Mr. Jones.

02:58.913 --> 03:02.381
Hey, thank you, by the way,
for, uh-- we'll just--

03:02.383 --> 03:04.883
glad to help.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.686
Do not antagonize
local law enforcement.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.354
But it's so much fun.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.722
One of these days your
luck's gonna run out

03:10.724 --> 03:12.191
and a man with a badge
is gonna put an end

03:12.193 --> 03:13.225
to your fun once
and for all.

03:13.227 --> 03:16.295
Yet today is not that day.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.464
Cassandra:
Guys, there's a pattern.

03:19.466 --> 03:23.302
It's waves, waves,

03:23.304 --> 03:24.836
waves, amber waves of grain.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.873
Grain, cereal, cereal,
milky cereal.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.709
Oh, yum, tasty.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.544
I'm sorry.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.780
I don't see it.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.764
That is--

03:52.766 --> 03:56.568
--A fingerprint.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.270
A big one.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.571
It might be a troll.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.273
A troll?

04:01.275 --> 04:05.544
Uh, yes, I understand
your skepticism, Mr. Jones.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.980
Trolls are not indigenous
to the Pacific Northwest.

04:07.982 --> 04:10.549
But with the return
of magic to the world,

04:10.551 --> 04:12.551
all sorts of odd things
are waking up.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.453
And if indeed it is
a troll you're facing,

04:14.455 --> 04:18.923
we'll it's not been nice
knowing you, per Se--

04:18.926 --> 04:22.361
How do we fight a troll?

04:22.363 --> 04:23.363
You don't.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.464
You flee or you die quickly.

04:25.466 --> 04:29.935
But if you can get me a
picture or a sample to analyze,

04:29.937 --> 04:33.472
I could identify the species
and find a weakness.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.507
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but subduing a troll

04:35.509 --> 04:39.278
to get a sample,
might be a little tricky?

04:39.280 --> 04:40.979
I'll be happy
to correct you, Colonel.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.414
You are wrong.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.449
Trolls are nothing
but subdued.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.852
In daylight.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.056
Oh. Cryptic and annoying.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.758
A two-fer.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.961
Okay, so we have to get a sample
or a picture and not die.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.430
You two, see if the sheriff
has any surveillance from the bridge.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.798
Maybe we'll get lucky.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.333
I'll see if I can find
anything on the ground.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.434
Um, maybe I should
go with you.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.735
You and stone
work together.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.537
- Got it?
- Yeah, no problem.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.872
And I'll head back
to the Annex.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.674
I think it's time for
my after breakfast nap.

05:08.676 --> 05:12.544
You're coming with me.
Let's go track a troll.

05:12.546 --> 05:16.081
Tree. Tree.

05:16.083 --> 05:20.485
Tree. Tree.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.954
Tree.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.056
Troll!

05:24.058 --> 05:25.590
Oh, no,
just another tree.

05:25.592 --> 05:26.958
Jones, you have to
adjust that attitude.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.360
You want to call yourself
a librarian,

05:28.362 --> 05:30.095
you're gonna have
to do the job.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.664
Job? Ooh, no, don't like
the sound of that word.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.967
You see, I became a librarian
because it looked like fun.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.636
Stealing artifacts,
dodging monsters.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.604
I like a challenge.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.506
There's more to life
than traveling the world

05:41.508 --> 05:42.741
and pushing your luck.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.409
Not for me there isn't.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.978
When it stops being fun,
I get bored.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.415
When I'm bored, I'm gone.

05:50.417 --> 05:53.685
I think your definition
of bored and mine

05:53.687 --> 05:57.055
differ greatly.

05:57.057 --> 06:01.893
"Trolls are nothing but
subdued in daylight."

06:01.895 --> 06:05.063
That's just a pile
of rocks, right?

06:05.065 --> 06:07.699
Hmm. Then you should have
no problem reaching in there

06:07.701 --> 06:10.001
and grabbing a few pebbles.

06:10.003 --> 06:13.605
Go on. Grab a few.

06:28.389 --> 06:29.621
Thank you.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.956
What?

06:30.958 --> 06:33.859
Um, I didn't think you'd
want to work with me.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.428
I told you, Cassandra.
I can work with you.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.929
I like you.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.098
I just don't trust you.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.536
So, what, am I supposed
to just keep

06:44.538 --> 06:47.172
running around trying
to regain your trust?

06:47.174 --> 06:48.440
No.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.809
No, I'm cool
with the way it is.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.814
Surveillance photos from
last night you called about.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.582
Thank you.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.918
Thanks, these will really help with our
traffic flow study.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.653
Well.

07:01.655 --> 07:06.124
Small car, medium car,
big truck, bridge.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.193
Small, medium, big bridge.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.528
Why does that sound familiar?

07:09.530 --> 07:11.129
Hi!

07:11.131 --> 07:12.898
Morning, sheriff!

07:12.900 --> 07:17.102
Mayor!
What are you doing?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.838
( Sighs )
Just out for a morning jog.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.641
Wanted to see how last night's
bridge accident was being managed.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.977
Sir, I mean, what are you
doing in your birthday suit?

07:25.979 --> 07:28.947
Yes, my wife did get me
this jogging suit for my birthday.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.016
How did you know?

07:33.587 --> 07:35.220
Well, everything seems
to be in hand here.

07:35.222 --> 07:38.089
I'll leave you to it Sheriff.

07:38.091 --> 07:41.159
That is more than I ever wanted
to see of any elected official.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.594
I take it that's not normal.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.864
Nope. Can't say
that it is.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.933
Is there any other
unnatural stuff

07:47.935 --> 07:49.468
that's going on around here?

07:49.470 --> 07:52.938
We have our usual
small town problems.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.006
Uh, there's a farm
down the way claims

07:55.008 --> 07:57.108
they're hearing voices from
a barn full of animals.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.910
A girl from a local community
college who went to

07:58.912 --> 08:01.179
a music festival last week,
didn't come back.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.616
And old Mrs. Stubbins was
stuck in her pizza oven.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.585
We got her out okay.

08:06.587 --> 08:09.020
There's weirder stuff
in the big cities, right?

08:09.022 --> 08:11.923
- Yeah.
- You bet.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.726
- Uh, what about-- yeah.
- Thanks.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.261
- You betcha.
- Thank you.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.597
Cheers.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.972
Definitely a troll.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.273
Actually, no.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.875
Well, it sure looked
like a troll.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.277
No, we're saying
it's more than just a troll.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.745
( Screaming )

08:39.019 --> 08:44.856
That is a really big wolf.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.625
Everybody!
Stay back.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.760
( Growls )

08:49.963 --> 08:52.297
We need help.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.132
( Woman screams )

08:56.803 --> 08:58.870
( Wolf whimpers, thuds )

09:01.275 --> 09:02.908
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

09:02.910 --> 09:07.546
Well, I just--
I don't know.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.717
Whoa.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.686
This is no ordinary wolf.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.655
I mean, it's at least twice
the average size

09:16.657 --> 09:22.227
and it was unusually
hostile and--

09:22.229 --> 09:26.331
--It's wearing
a frilly nightcap.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.199
A wolf in a nightcap.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.068
Little Red Riding Hood?

09:30.070 --> 09:33.672
A naked mayor.
The Emperor's New Clothes.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.574
Three cars.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.043
Small, medium and
the big one was attacked by a troll.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.778
That's the Three
Billy Goats Gruff.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.746
Fairy tales are
coming to life.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.049
Fairy tales are coming to
life and attacking people.

09:44.051 --> 09:48.853
Someone has weaponized
fairy tales?

09:53.694 --> 09:57.362
If someone is making,
wow, okay--

09:57.364 --> 10:01.600
fairy tales come to life,

10:01.602 --> 10:03.835
the question is
what or who?

10:03.837 --> 10:05.303
Yes.

10:05.305 --> 10:11.142
Now, these are all of
the magical items, curses

10:11.144 --> 10:14.746
and paradoxes
that could possibly

10:14.748 --> 10:17.616
cause fairy tales
to come true and attack.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.684
So fifty-seven.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.920
We have to find fifty-seven
magical items.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.388
Ick.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.890
Listen, no, luckily
for all of our sanities

10:25.892 --> 10:29.628
we can employ a process
of elimination.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.163
We can cross off any artifact
that is currently

10:32.165 --> 10:34.299
in the library since
being un-tethered

10:34.301 --> 10:39.270
from this reality makes
accessing them rather difficult.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.040
There have been no fires or
floods reported in the area

10:42.042 --> 10:48.013
so we can cross off anything that
requires displays of nature's power.

10:48.015 --> 10:52.017
The immortals prefer southern
Europe this time of the year.

10:52.019 --> 10:56.655
The Libris Fabula has been
lost for centuries, thankfully.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.657
It is a really nasty one.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.659
The Black Mask is not
worth mentioning at this point

11:00.661 --> 11:02.360
and the Genie's lamp can go.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.862
Why not the Genie's lamp?

11:03.864 --> 11:06.097
It's never the Genie's lamp.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.732
Okay.

11:07.734 --> 11:12.437
So that leaves us with the
Mother Goose Treaty of 1918.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.906
They never forgave
the way Beatrix Potter

11:14.908 --> 11:16.675
rewrote that bloody history.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.044
And Aesop's Lyre.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.146
Loose nukes, nerve gas,
I know how to find.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.782
Where do we even start here?

11:23.784 --> 11:25.150
Autopsy.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.885
Autopsy on who?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.453
Well, the giant dead wolf,
of course.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.689
- Bring it back here.
- Bring it back here?

11:30.691 --> 11:32.157
You want us to move a giant
dead wolf through town

11:32.159 --> 11:36.127
and put it through
a magical door.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.696
No problem.
( Chuckles )

11:37.698 --> 11:41.032
Cassandra: Wait. Where did that
wolf end up?

11:41.034 --> 11:44.035
We're the only place in town
with a freezer big enough

11:44.037 --> 11:46.905
to hold the body,
so Sheriff Heyer

11:46.907 --> 11:51.009
said once Fish and
Wildlife come, I can keep it.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.410
Keep the wolf?

11:52.412 --> 11:56.715
I'm gonna get it stuffed,
put it out front,

11:56.717 --> 11:59.484
rename the place
the Big Wolf Tavern.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.486
People will come from
miles around to see it.

12:01.488 --> 12:05.223
I even got the
Guinness people coming.

12:05.225 --> 12:09.160
That's sure something.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.729
Next round's on me.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.497
Wow, chivalry's not dead.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.766
So what do I do about stone?

12:14.768 --> 12:16.267
He'll come around.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.936
I've seen a million guys
like him.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.071
Farm boys straight off
the bus into basic.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.372
World's nothing but
black and white.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.141
( Girls sighing )

12:23.143 --> 12:25.477
Guys like him have a wide turning radius,
but they do turn.

12:25.479 --> 12:28.113
What?

12:28.115 --> 12:31.516
Do I have something, here?

12:32.919 --> 12:35.286
I feel like everyone's
staring at me.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.122
I mean, why would
they stare at me?

12:37.124 --> 12:39.758
You're the one who's having
the amazing hair day.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.761
I didn't do anything
to my-- my hair.

12:42.763 --> 12:47.832
It's so shiny and full.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.234
We're on.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.236
Hey, Walter, how are
those drinks coming?

12:51.238 --> 12:53.404
Here you are, milady.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.939
Thanks.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.241
So, I was wondering--

12:56.243 --> 13:00.411
Oh, yes.

13:00.413 --> 13:03.047
Do you think that maybe

13:03.049 --> 13:05.517
the Guinness record people

13:05.519 --> 13:07.519
would like to take
your picture?

13:07.521 --> 13:10.255
Very handsome man.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.559
Ezekiel: Twice the size but
half the weight.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.494
Moving a wolf carcass
the size of a pony

13:16.496 --> 13:18.930
through a small town,
we're gonna get spotted.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.065
- Hey, it was your plan.
- I was being sarcastic.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.867
Subtext is very hard
with you.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.235
I don't have any subtext.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.805
Shh.

13:26.807 --> 13:31.209
- Shh.
- Shh!

13:31.211 --> 13:32.343
All right.
In the truck.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.913
No, we're not
stealing a truck.

13:34.915 --> 13:40.518
No, of course "we" aren't.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.587
<i>I</i> am.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.923
No, no. You're not
stealing a truck.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.958
Oh, unlocked.
Lucky me.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.860
Unlocked doesn't
mean turned on.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.863
And we can hardly
call it stealing.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.134
Nobody's that lucky.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.841
So, what, is the cap stuck?

14:02.843 --> 14:06.244
No, it's not just stuck, it's,
like, part of the wolf's body.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.512
It's pretty cool.

14:07.514 --> 14:11.549
This probably
eliminates Aesop's Lyre.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.218
While it does make animals
loquacious,

14:13.220 --> 14:15.887
I have never known it
to affect their wardrobe.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.288
So, it's the goose one?

14:17.290 --> 14:19.557
Yeah, the Mother Goose
Treaty of 1918.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.626
Only one way to be sure.

14:21.628 --> 14:25.530
If it is, the inside of this wolf
will be stuffed with feathers.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.065
Scalpel.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.933
You know what?
Maybe the Obsidian Blade?

14:28.935 --> 14:31.102
That would be...

14:35.075 --> 14:36.407
Oh, well, that might work.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.408
Do you even know
what you're doing?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.978
Of course I do.
I think.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.648
I don't know-- it feels right.

14:43.650 --> 14:47.285
Oh, something's in here,
but--

14:52.259 --> 14:53.625
What happened?

14:53.627 --> 14:56.060
Where am I?

14:56.062 --> 14:57.896
This is very bad.
It's not the treaty.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.231
It's the Libris Fabula.
The story book.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.067
It can bring any story you
want to life but at a price.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.669
You said that was lost.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.171
Yes, well,
somebody found it.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.676
The huntsman
cut open the wolf

15:11.678 --> 15:17.181
and Little Red Riding Hood
emerged whole and safe.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.953
I love these stories.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.959
Oh, we're all relieved you found her
but she's not making a lot of sense.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.361
Said something about
you pulling her out of a wolf?

15:30.363 --> 15:34.699
She suffered exposure
in the woods.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.267
Traumatized.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.336
Thank you for
letting us talk to her.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.071
It wasn't up to me.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.713
She wouldn't let go
of your friend's hand.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.245
I don't know what happened.

15:47.247 --> 15:50.949
So you don't
remember anything?

15:52.585 --> 15:54.619
I remember
finishing my shift

15:54.621 --> 15:56.955
and then going
out to my car

15:56.957 --> 15:59.457
and then you pulling me
out of that thing.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.059
Actually, no, no, no.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.461
That was, I was the one
that pulled you out.

16:03.463 --> 16:07.498
I know, but, you
played an important role.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.371
So, you finished
your shift?

16:13.373 --> 16:16.341
Actually, I skipped out
a little early.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.143
I didn't want to miss
the opening act.

16:19.145 --> 16:22.613
Can I get your number?

16:22.615 --> 16:24.182
Wow.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.517
Just in case my life
needs saving again?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.987
Yeah! Huh?

16:28.989 --> 16:33.257
I'm not really
comfortable with that.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.426
There's a-- I'm not
gonna be able to--

16:35.428 --> 16:36.995
you know what?
Here's the thing--

16:36.997 --> 16:38.763
I'm actually,
if you don't mind,

16:38.765 --> 16:40.365
I'm the one that pulled
you out, right over here.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.632
I'm the one that
pulled you out.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.401
Of a wolf.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.738
You know, Walter at
the bar said his wolf

16:46.740 --> 16:48.506
went missing after
you two were there.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.742
Your high school mascot's
the wolves, right?

16:50.744 --> 16:54.746
Your football rivals, I bet they'd love
to steal your giant wolf.

16:54.748 --> 16:57.248
Sheriff, between the accident
on the bridge,

16:57.250 --> 16:58.783
the wolf on the street,
and the girl,

16:58.785 --> 17:00.451
you're probably
a bit overworked.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.786
We're glad we could help.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.187
What he means is--

17:03.189 --> 17:04.789
No, I know exactly
what he means.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.790
And he might just be right.

17:06.792 --> 17:09.560
If only he hadn't
pinged my radar.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.496
I know trouble, young man.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.498
And you?

17:12.499 --> 17:14.365
( Sniffs loudly )

17:14.367 --> 17:16.634
You smell like trouble.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.203
( Whistles )

17:20.740 --> 17:23.674
What did I tell you about antagonizing
local law enforcement?

17:23.675 --> 17:27.278
What made you think
I would listen?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.247
Girl doesn't
remember anything.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.482
Let's talk to Jenkins,
find out how this book works.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.217
Baird: Let's go.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.358
Ah, I adore these.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.695
It's like a miniature
apartment building.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.432
And when you hit
the right numbers,

17:47.434 --> 17:52.703
the occupant of your
choice leaps to his death

17:54.274 --> 17:56.307
and becomes your snack.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.842
You don't get
out much, do you?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.310
Ha. Only when necessary.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.479
And the Libris Fabula
calls for it.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.514
As long as that book
is being read,

18:03.516 --> 18:04.515
its stories will
come to life.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.817
Any story?

18:05.819 --> 18:07.251
At first only the stories
already in the book

18:07.253 --> 18:09.153
come to life but as
the book gains power,

18:09.155 --> 18:13.157
those stories can be changed,
new stories added, rewriting reality.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.126
Mm. Reality.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.161
It's just shared narrative
we agree to believe.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.830
You're a very odd cowboy.

18:18.832 --> 18:20.565
So I've been told.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.166
And as the stories
come to life,

18:22.168 --> 18:23.568
they get more powerful
and more powerful,

18:23.570 --> 18:25.303
more people are
swept up in them.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.539
Entire towns,
entire nations.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.174
How big are we talking?

18:30.176 --> 18:32.643
What do you think
caused the Black Death?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.445
The yersinia pestis bacterium.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.215
You're adorable.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.850
Can it be controlled?

18:38.852 --> 18:42.120
Can you control
your imagination?

18:42.122 --> 18:43.122
- No.
- No.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.555
No.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.124
No, the book's only limit
to bring stories to life

18:46.126 --> 18:49.527
is that life has
to come from somewhere.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.662
So it needs a power source
to feed the magic.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.797
Very good.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.233
And the people who
feed the story,

18:55.235 --> 18:58.870
they grow weak,
they get sick, they die.

18:58.872 --> 19:02.206
So, somewhere in
the records of this hospital--

19:02.208 --> 19:04.909
There's a pattern of people
becoming ill for no reason.

19:04.911 --> 19:07.812
Good, you two comb
through the records,

19:07.814 --> 19:09.614
see if you can find
magic patient zero.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.782
Stone, you and I are gonna
hunt down that book.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.284
All right.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.852
I think I saw a local
library down the street.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.822
Maybe we can get a lead
on local collectors, rare books--

19:17.824 --> 19:20.925
- Ezekiel?
- ( Alarm blares )

19:26.432 --> 19:29.867
Just stay out of jail.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.566
Nope.

20:05.939 --> 20:07.572
Ah-ha!

20:07.574 --> 20:09.574
Here's a case of a boy
getting sick after

20:09.576 --> 20:13.911
eating a piece of
siding off of his house.

20:13.913 --> 20:17.982
Ooh, and one about an epidemic
of food poisoning at a local apple farm.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.284
Psychiatric file on
a woman paranoid

20:20.286 --> 20:23.688
that her stepchildren
were trying to kill her.

20:23.690 --> 20:27.258
All of these have been happening in
the past three weeks.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.893
Those are people
being affected by the story,

20:28.895 --> 20:32.296
not being sucked dry
to power the book.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.364
And no one died.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.765
Maybe it's too new.

20:34.767 --> 20:38.469
Maybe the Libris Fabula
isn't strong enough yet?

20:38.471 --> 20:43.541
Yes, it took several years
for the plague to build up.

20:43.543 --> 20:47.345
Still, something odd.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.247
Well, we're lucky they're just getting
trapped in fairy tales.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.349
You know, singing, dancing,

20:51.351 --> 20:54.252
woodland creatures
making ball gowns.

20:54.254 --> 20:57.655
Oh, my dear, these are
not your cartoon stories.

20:57.657 --> 21:01.425
These are the original fairy tales
filled with death and dismemberment.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.661
And there's still
a long list of archetypes.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.029
Archetypes?

21:05.031 --> 21:06.797
The mayor was the only one
able to wear

21:06.799 --> 21:08.032
the emperor's new clothes.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.601
And that girl, she cut out
of work early,

21:10.603 --> 21:12.336
strayed from the path
she was meant to be on

21:12.338 --> 21:14.972
and she got eaten
by a wolf for it.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.041
Fairy tales are getting
stronger.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.043
There are more roles to
fill that we haven't seen.

21:19.045 --> 21:23.314
Princes, princesses,
huntsmen, rogues.

21:23.316 --> 21:26.651
And their stories,
their fates,

21:26.653 --> 21:29.053
are often
the most terrible of all.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.633
Oh! What?

21:49.309 --> 21:51.008
What are you doing?
Are you okay?

21:51.010 --> 21:53.611
My shoe keeps falling off.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.813
- Hello.
- Hi, there.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.715
Can I help you folks?

21:57.717 --> 22:00.318
We are looking
for a book.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.686
( Chuckles )

22:01.688 --> 22:03.754
Well, you've come
to the right place.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.523
This is the library.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.558
I'm Mr. Maguire.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.027
I've been running the Bremen
library for the past 30 years.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.763
Well, then you should
know every book in here.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.398
What we're looking
for is very old.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.801
Well, got a lot
of old books.

22:16.803 --> 22:20.371
Austen, Bronte, Dickens,

22:20.373 --> 22:22.440
not that anybody
wants the classics.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.974
Nowadays,
I read to the kids,

22:23.976 --> 22:27.044
it's all Katniss Everdeen
or Artemis Fowl.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.080
Whoever that is.

22:29.082 --> 22:31.649
Well, we're looking
for something just a little bit older.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.951
Oh. Um...

22:37.990 --> 22:39.557
Old like that.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.359
Ah.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.063
That's 15th century folio.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.398
Mm-hmm.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.400
That should be in a museum.

22:49.402 --> 22:52.570
Is that
"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili"?

22:52.572 --> 22:54.572
Yeah, I'm just finishing up
some cataloging.

22:54.574 --> 22:57.808
These are part of a collection
recently donated to us

22:57.810 --> 23:00.611
by Mr. Deter in his will.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.880
Deter. Thompson Deter?

23:02.882 --> 23:04.515
Ah!

23:10.890 --> 23:12.523
Hi.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.625
What are you doing here?

23:14.627 --> 23:19.130
Ezekiel Jones, world class
coin hunter, and you are--

23:19.132 --> 23:21.165
Dying.

23:21.167 --> 23:26.470
But it's okay, they let me
choose my flavor of Jell-O

23:26.472 --> 23:28.105
well, at least you have
that going for you.

23:28.107 --> 23:31.409
It took me awhile,

23:31.411 --> 23:34.078
but when my ANC
got down to 1,000,

23:34.080 --> 23:37.715
I graduated from green
to the red flavor.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.583
Ugh. Hate the green.

23:39.585 --> 23:44.188
If I get under 500, I think
they'll break out the pudding.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.724
Well, that's not right.

23:46.726 --> 23:49.693
You should be able to sneak
desserts better than that.

23:49.695 --> 23:53.764
Oh, yeah?
How would you do it?

23:57.537 --> 24:01.772
Thompson Deter is-- was
a rare books collector.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.841
I heard he has the biggest
collection of arcane

24:03.843 --> 24:05.576
and mystic texts
in the world.

24:05.578 --> 24:06.811
I'm sorry, when did he die?

24:06.813 --> 24:08.479
A few weeks back.

24:08.481 --> 24:11.916
He left this entire
collection to detail.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.819
It takes me a month to get
through one manuscript.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.688
Well, maybe we could help
you catalog them.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.724
We're librarians, too.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.693
Really?

24:22.695 --> 24:24.061
Really.

24:24.063 --> 24:27.097
As trustee
of this collection,

24:27.099 --> 24:28.866
I have a sacred duty.

24:28.868 --> 24:32.703
I have to document all of these
before I can expose any more.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.805
Sorry.

24:38.878 --> 24:42.746
We need someone
who can pick a lock.

24:43.683 --> 24:44.949
Feel for the pins.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.717
These are standard
five pin locks.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.719
Kitchen lock's
will be the same.

24:48.721 --> 24:52.490
Now, push each pin up
'til it locks into place.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.024
Then turn.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.793
There you go!

24:55.795 --> 24:58.195
A little bit of practice and
you'll be swimming in tapioca.

24:58.197 --> 25:02.833
Problem is, I'm not really
supposed to be out of bed.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.669
I get tired.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.872
What do you have?

25:07.874 --> 25:10.774
They don't know.

25:10.776 --> 25:13.677
I just got sick one day.

25:13.679 --> 25:19.517
I fell asleep at story hour at
the library and I woke up here.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.986
Look, all I know is you gotta
be the one to help yourself.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.788
Do what you want
when you want.

25:24.790 --> 25:27.390
Otherwise you spend the rest of your life
stuck with green Jell-O.

25:28.227 --> 25:33.864
I think my dad would rather
I just stay in this room.

25:33.866 --> 25:39.270
He said a girl was saying
she got swallowed by a wolf.

25:39.272 --> 25:40.704
Yeah. I heard about that.

25:40.706 --> 25:43.040
Sort of cool, right?

25:43.042 --> 25:46.877
Like one of those
old fairy tales?

25:46.879 --> 25:49.313
Fairy tales aren't
really my thing.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.949
The bad guy?
He never wins.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.618
I love them.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.854
Magic and heroes--

25:56.856 --> 25:59.723
What are you looking for?

25:59.725 --> 26:03.594
I was just wondering if you
had any books I could borrow.

26:03.596 --> 26:06.230
They don't let me
keep any books in here.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.700
It's not sterile.

26:09.702 --> 26:12.269
Not even any visitors
except reading days.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.038
I'll be back, okay?

26:14.040 --> 26:16.307
Hang on to this for me.
For luck.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.921
Hi!

26:30.923 --> 26:34.592
Cassandra, you are
so charming.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.060
Let me get you
another drink.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.662
No, honey, why don't you get
me some French fries?

26:38.664 --> 26:40.364
My friends are here.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.633
We think we found
the book at the library.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.368
You saw it?

26:44.370 --> 26:46.337
Stone: No, but there's a rare
collection of books there.

26:46.339 --> 26:47.871
It fits.

26:47.873 --> 26:49.106
Oh, good.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.741
We need you to pick
a lock at the library.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.042
Easy. But we have to go to
the hospital first.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.344
Cassandra: No, there's no time.

26:53.346 --> 26:54.345
If the book is
in the collection,

26:54.347 --> 26:55.746
we need to get it now.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.848
We couldn't find
a pattern of people

26:57.850 --> 26:59.984
getting sick but that's because
the book wasn't strong enough yet.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.152
Maybe we can find it
and stop it

27:02.154 --> 27:03.821
before it gets strong
enough to kill someone.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.289
Collection's only been
there a few weeks.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.857
It makes sense.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.859
No, listen. There's a kid
at the hospital.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.095
She likes fairy tales and
she's sick, no one knows why.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.663
She's the one--

27:12.665 --> 27:15.265
She's the one you should
have stayed away from.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.634
Sheriff, what is this?

27:16.636 --> 27:17.801
Your friend here broke into

27:17.803 --> 27:19.703
my daughter's hospital room.

27:19.705 --> 27:21.071
Bad enough he could
get her sicker,

27:21.073 --> 27:22.806
but I find her
practicing lock-picking?

27:22.808 --> 27:24.208
( Growls )

27:24.210 --> 27:26.143
I told you I could
smell trouble.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.679
Jamie's your kid.
Lucky me.

27:28.681 --> 27:31.148
But tell me, Sheriff,
how are you going to arrest me

27:31.150 --> 27:34.418
when you can't catch me?

27:34.420 --> 27:36.687
Sheriff, you know you can't
take him without charging him.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.989
He comes with me or else!

27:38.991 --> 27:42.026
Yeah?
Or else what?

27:42.028 --> 27:44.695
( Growls )

27:44.697 --> 27:47.131
Or I'll huff and I'll puff and

27:47.133 --> 27:52.936
I'll blow this whole bar down!

28:02.815 --> 28:04.314
Another wolf?

28:04.316 --> 28:06.684
Different fairy tale,
it's a different wolf.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.686
And he wants his little piggy.

28:08.688 --> 28:11.155
Well how is this my fault?

28:11.157 --> 28:12.856
Okay, it's a little my fault.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.158
We've got to move
before the sheriff realizes

28:14.160 --> 28:15.859
this building is
only made out of wood.

28:21.434 --> 28:23.801
( Sniffs, growls )

28:25.705 --> 28:27.905
All right, looks like
the coast is--

28:27.907 --> 28:29.740
Down! Down! Get down!

28:34.980 --> 28:37.948
Okay. How many wolves are
there in the original fairy tales?

28:37.950 --> 28:41.819
Well, considering they
originated in Germanic folklore

28:41.821 --> 28:44.455
and wolf's the natural enemy
of the agrarian life--

28:44.457 --> 28:46.056
I'd say a lot. Why?

28:46.058 --> 28:49.293
Cassandra: The football players.
They're the wolves.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.230
We have to get to
the library and get that book.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.798
The old man has to have it.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.166
No, no, no, we need to
go to the hospital.

28:56.168 --> 28:57.234
No, the library's closer.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.236
Yeah, but we got--

28:58.237 --> 28:59.237
( humming )

28:59.238 --> 29:00.437
♪ Ha-ha-ha ♪

29:00.439 --> 29:01.438
Eve, what are you doing?
Are you humming?

29:01.440 --> 29:02.906
What?

29:02.908 --> 29:04.208
- You were just humming.
- No, I wasn't.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.043
All right, look,
this, this is strange.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.178
All right? Cassandra's
like a chick magnet and Baird,

29:08.180 --> 29:10.280
I'm pretty sure that hair
is not army regulation.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.249
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're being strange?

29:12.251 --> 29:14.084
Where'd you get the axe?

29:15.855 --> 29:20.257
I don't know.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.126
( Sniffs )

29:22.128 --> 29:23.527
You smell that?

29:25.531 --> 29:28.031
A storm's a coming.

29:28.033 --> 29:30.067
There's a bird on you.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.468
Yeah.

29:31.470 --> 29:35.906
Yeah.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.775
Okay.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.476
( Phone rings )

29:41.180 --> 29:43.147
Yes?

29:43.149 --> 29:44.915
Jenkins! Quick question.

29:44.917 --> 29:48.085
Is it possible we're getting
sucked into the fairy tales?

29:48.087 --> 29:50.120
Fatal, yet interesting.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.023
Just out of curiosity,
what roles are you playing?

29:53.025 --> 29:57.995
Well, I'm pretty sure
Stone's the Huntsman.

29:57.997 --> 29:59.463
And Cassandra's
Prince Charming.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.898
Weirdly.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.199
And Baird is a princess.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.201
( Scoffs )

30:03.202 --> 30:04.202
A princess!

30:04.203 --> 30:07.471
( Laughs )

30:07.473 --> 30:08.906
It's happening.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.874
Look, Jenkins,
if we're all heroes,

30:10.876 --> 30:12.943
we're all the good guys, that means
we get happy endings, right?

30:12.945 --> 30:15.546
No, remember I told you,
even for the heroes,

30:15.548 --> 30:18.248
there's death, dismemberment,
100-year comas.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.151
Not to mention all
the civilian bystanders.

30:21.153 --> 30:24.454
In fact the only one who escapes
every story unscathed is the "Jack".

30:24.456 --> 30:26.356
The "Jack"?

30:26.358 --> 30:28.091
Yes, Jack.
The nimble rogue.

30:28.093 --> 30:31.962
The lucky thief
who lives by his wits.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.565
Where's Ezekiel?

30:34.567 --> 30:36.033
All right. Listen.
Good luck finding the book.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.401
Got to go.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.373
All right, sheriff's gone.

30:44.577 --> 30:47.177
Look at everybody else.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.548
I'm sorry, have you
seen my sheep?

30:51.550 --> 30:55.419
No? Has anyone
seen my sheep?

30:57.923 --> 31:01.001
Man: I did not look
at another woman!

31:01.025 --> 31:02.861
( Slide whistle )

31:02.862 --> 31:06.129
Woman: Did your nose
just grow?

31:06.131 --> 31:07.264
Ooh.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.899
The book's
getting stronger.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.034
It's not just us,
it's everybody in town.

31:11.036 --> 31:14.338
They could all
get hurt, or worse.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.106
Baird:
New plan.

31:16.108 --> 31:18.609
We get everyone on the highway
and out of town to--

31:18.611 --> 31:19.877
( creaking )

31:20.613 --> 31:22.079
Okay, old plan.

31:22.081 --> 31:23.513
Back to the library,

31:23.515 --> 31:25.616
but we take all
the civilians with us.

31:25.618 --> 31:28.919
Hey! Come with me if
you want to live!

31:28.921 --> 31:31.255
I've been waiting for you to
say that to me my whole life.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.257
Okay.

31:33.259 --> 31:34.424
There they are!

31:34.426 --> 31:36.126
Let's move!
Time to move!

31:36.128 --> 31:38.495
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

32:01.220 --> 32:04.454
The prince, the princess
and the huntsman.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.457
As the wolves followed
their prey down the path--

32:07.459 --> 32:08.625
Stop.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.427
Oh, hello.

32:12.932 --> 32:14.197
Jamie? Wake up.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.666
What's wrong with her?

32:15.668 --> 32:18.969
This happens when she's
listening to the stories.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.203
It's reading day.

32:20.205 --> 32:22.072
You think you're helping her
by reading her

32:22.074 --> 32:23.373
what she likes but you're
draining the life out of her.

32:23.375 --> 32:26.009
( Laughs )
That's ridiculous.

32:26.011 --> 32:29.479
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

32:30.983 --> 32:34.217
All right. It's time
to stop the crazy

32:34.219 --> 32:36.720
Oh, oh, ooh.

32:36.722 --> 32:39.690
You know, when I started
reading this book to the kids,

32:39.692 --> 32:43.627
I found out
that it drains the listener

32:43.629 --> 32:47.097
but it gives the storyteller
some of its strength.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.232
I haven't felt
this good in years.

32:49.234 --> 32:50.300
You're hurting Jamie.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.668
You're going to kill her.

32:51.670 --> 32:56.740
People say you're lucky
if you die of old age.

32:56.742 --> 33:00.377
But do you have any idea
what it's like to get old?

33:00.379 --> 33:02.045
To be forgotten?

33:02.047 --> 33:04.514
I gave my life
to this town.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.284
Now this town is
giving life to me.

33:07.286 --> 33:11.688
It's my happily ever after!

33:13.025 --> 33:14.725
You're welcome to stay
and listen.

33:14.727 --> 33:17.194
Listen, while
I take out your friends.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.329
Now, where were we?

33:19.331 --> 33:20.697
Oh, yes, yes, here we are.

33:20.699 --> 33:25.302
The wolves hunted their prey.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.206
Everybody in the back.

33:36.548 --> 33:37.647
Go.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.082
I don't want to leave you.

33:39.084 --> 33:41.485
I know, but I need you
to be safe.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.157
All right,
come on.

33:47.159 --> 33:50.193
They're coming.
We got to hold them back.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.495
Until?

33:51.497 --> 33:54.798
Until a lucky rogue
can save us.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.299
( Cellphone rings )

33:56.301 --> 33:57.701
Maguire:
Took all the villagers--

33:57.703 --> 34:00.037
If you left because
you got bored, so help me--

34:00.039 --> 34:01.772
I'm at the hospital
with the book

34:01.774 --> 34:03.273
and your nice
old library guy.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.574
Actually not so nice.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.276
He's reading
the book to the kid.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.677
He's getting some
kind of juice from it.

34:07.679 --> 34:10.112
Kid? What kid?
The kid you found?

34:10.114 --> 34:12.149
Yeah, I tried to tell you.
I stumbled on her by sheer--

34:12.150 --> 34:14.117
Sheer luck--
of course you did.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.753
Jones, you're the only one
the story works for, not against.

34:16.755 --> 34:17.755
What?

34:17.755 --> 34:19.322
You have to get him to stop.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.357
The story he's telling
will kill us.

34:20.359 --> 34:21.757
It'll kill the town.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.827
Maguire:
They could hear,

34:23.829 --> 34:29.266
but the wolves smashed
in the doors of the sad little castle!

34:30.369 --> 34:32.069
( Glass shatters )

34:32.071 --> 34:34.471
( Growling )

34:34.473 --> 34:36.072
( Sniffs )

34:36.074 --> 34:39.109
Smells like dinner.

34:41.847 --> 34:47.451
My friends, now is the time
we will rise against

34:47.453 --> 34:48.752
the forces of darkness.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.154
There is no beast that
cannot be slain,

34:51.156 --> 34:53.556
no army that will
not be faced.

34:53.559 --> 34:58.395
Together we will fight
and together we will win!

34:58.397 --> 35:00.197
( Cheering )

35:00.199 --> 35:01.865
( Snarls )

35:01.867 --> 35:03.266
Baird.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.339
Hey!

35:12.311 --> 35:14.644
( Growls )

35:29.161 --> 35:31.561
Hey guys, I'm actually
pretty good at this.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.266
( Whimpers )

35:37.569 --> 35:39.503
( Whimpers )

35:42.174 --> 35:44.207
Why am I wearing heels?

35:44.209 --> 35:46.610
- While the villagers cowered--
- Jones!

35:46.612 --> 35:48.278
The princess,
prince and huntsman--

35:48.280 --> 35:50.180
change the story, Jones!

35:50.182 --> 35:52.249
Change the story!

35:52.251 --> 35:53.884
Change the story.

35:53.886 --> 35:57.154
The wolves that were hunting
them were all suddenly blind.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.558
It has
to be a story.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.461
Stories have a beginning,
the wolves hunt your friends,

36:04.463 --> 36:07.164
a middle, they find them,

36:07.166 --> 36:08.198
and an end.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.600
The wolves kill everyone.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.235
( Growling )

36:20.646 --> 36:22.345
They're all dead.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.694
Jamie, Jamie, wake up.

36:41.233 --> 36:42.933
What story am
I supposed to tell?

36:42.935 --> 36:44.834
Yours. Give it
your happy ending.

36:44.836 --> 36:45.836
Tell your story.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.237
Okay.

36:47.239 --> 36:48.672
Quick before the spell
wears off.

36:48.674 --> 36:53.443
Well, in mine, in mine it
only looked like they died.

36:53.445 --> 36:58.915
Because the huntsman
is really a, a robot.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.553
Yeah, I can work with this.

37:05.290 --> 37:08.692
And the princess
is a ninja princess.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.928
( Wolves whimper )

37:11.930 --> 37:12.930
About time.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.431
Keep going, Jamie.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.866
The prince is really
Merlin in disguise

37:16.868 --> 37:18.768
and you can't kill Merlin.

37:25.244 --> 37:28.678
And using their combined skills
they chase the wolves away.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.522
Except for the head wolf.

37:39.524 --> 37:41.591
He's forced to pay
for his crime.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.959
But he doesn't die either.

37:42.961 --> 37:47.264
No. But he has
to eat green Jell-O.

37:47.266 --> 37:48.965
Forever.

37:50.502 --> 37:54.537
I don't even know
where these came from.

37:54.539 --> 37:56.306
The end.

37:56.308 --> 37:57.907
That can't be the end.

37:57.909 --> 38:00.343
Looks like you don't get
your happy ending after all.

38:07.319 --> 38:10.720
I just-- I don't
understand what happened.

38:10.722 --> 38:13.723
One minute, I was with you all
at Walter's tavern and then--

38:13.725 --> 38:17.827
Sometimes what happens is
when unexplainable events occur,

38:17.829 --> 38:20.930
people like to think it's
magic when really it's just--

38:20.932 --> 38:22.699
Swamp gas.
Swamp gas.

38:22.701 --> 38:25.402
We discovered it during
our traffic flow study.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.305
Yes, it's a natural,
but localized occurrence.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.840
It causes, you know,
people in a radius, the town,

38:30.842 --> 38:32.008
to mass hallucinate.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.810
Hallucinate?

38:33.812 --> 38:35.812
We need to call FEMA.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.081
No, no, no.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.517
No need to do--

38:40.519 --> 38:42.786
we've neutralized
the situation--

38:42.788 --> 38:44.487
is a thing that we do.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.624
The library,
jobs of the library.

38:47.626 --> 38:51.761
Anyway, that's why so many
crazy things kept happening.

38:51.763 --> 38:54.331
In fact, you might want
to give everyone in town

38:54.333 --> 38:55.598
a pass on
the last couple days.

38:57.436 --> 39:00.670
Jamie!
How are you out of bed?

39:00.672 --> 39:01.871
Jamie's feeling
a lot better.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.107
- Right kid?
- Right, Dad.

39:04.109 --> 39:06.643
I am.

39:06.645 --> 39:09.612
This can't be real.

39:09.614 --> 39:13.049
Wait, what did you do?

39:13.051 --> 39:15.518
I think this is one of
those times where we say,

39:15.520 --> 39:17.120
"and they lived
happily ever after,"

39:17.122 --> 39:19.389
and we go our separate ways.

39:22.728 --> 39:26.529
Oh, sweetie. Oh.

39:34.673 --> 39:38.041
Dad?
Who are those people?

39:38.043 --> 39:40.710
They're librarians,
honey.

39:40.712 --> 39:44.114
Librarians?

39:44.116 --> 39:47.584
Wow, now that I say
that out loud,

39:47.586 --> 39:50.453
that does not make
any sense at all.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.422
Not a lick.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.794
( Electricity buzzes )

39:58.764 --> 39:59.829
Jenkins!

40:02.901 --> 40:04.434
Are those--

40:04.436 --> 40:07.404
Yes. Thompson Deter's
arcane book collection?

40:07.406 --> 40:09.739
I decided it was likely
better that they come with us.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.174
Who knows what else is in them?

40:11.176 --> 40:13.576
I can only imagine.

40:13.578 --> 40:16.546
An annotated "Paradise Lost"?

40:16.548 --> 40:20.517
You don't want to know
who it's annotated by.

40:21.586 --> 40:25.855
The Libris Fabula.

40:26.892 --> 40:30.460
Baird:
Blank. It's blank.

40:30.462 --> 40:32.629
Not entirely.

40:35.567 --> 40:38.935
Magic always has a cost.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.804
I have just
the place for him.

40:40.806 --> 40:45.809
Mr. Maguire and the book
will cause no further problems.

40:50.715 --> 40:53.216
Is it just me or the deeper into magic
we get the weirder it gets?

40:53.218 --> 40:56.686
I don't know. I didn't mind all
those girls buying me drinks.

40:56.688 --> 40:58.755
I'm just glad my hair
is back to normal.

40:58.757 --> 41:01.224
I think I'll go spend some
time with the punching bag.

41:01.226 --> 41:02.459
Break a few nails.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.793
What about you, Ezekiel?

41:03.795 --> 41:04.961
What about me?

41:04.963 --> 41:07.464
Do you feel different?

41:07.466 --> 41:08.932
Nah.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.934
Really? That's it?

41:10.936 --> 41:12.235
You don't--
nothing at all?

41:12.237 --> 41:13.803
Why? Should I?

41:13.805 --> 41:16.873
Well, surprisingly,
you did save the day.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.242
Of course I did.
I'm awesome.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.177
So that's it?
You're awesome?

41:21.179 --> 41:22.779
Yeah.

41:22.781 --> 41:26.249
Well, everybody tells me
I can't do what I want,

41:26.251 --> 41:28.251
can't rely on luck,
but when a magic spell

41:28.253 --> 41:30.186
turns everybody into
heroes of legend,

41:30.188 --> 41:33.656
who did it turn me into?

41:33.658 --> 41:35.625
Me.

41:35.627 --> 41:37.193
Yep. I'm gonna go
punch something.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.662
I'm right behind ya.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.865
Seriously?

41:41.867 --> 41:44.734
You know
who's really lucky?

41:44.736 --> 41:47.570
Not me. You.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.239
For knowing me.

41:49.241 --> 41:51.207
You're welcome.
