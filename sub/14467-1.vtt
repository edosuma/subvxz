01:06.452 --> 01:07.476
Cheers.

01:13.492 --> 01:14.618
Bitterman?

01:18.230 --> 01:19.697
Why are you shaving?

01:19.865 --> 01:21.594
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.

01:21.767 --> 01:24.429
Bitterman, we're only doing this
for a bit of a laugh.

01:24.603 --> 01:27.128
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?

01:27.306 --> 01:30.173
And if we were, you would not be
my first choice of sidekick.

01:30.342 --> 01:33.505
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?

01:33.779 --> 01:35.246
I can see your tummy.

01:35.648 --> 01:38.583
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go
to your mother's fundraiser like this?

01:39.318 --> 01:40.842
I think it's black-tie.

01:42.021 --> 01:43.249
This is black.

01:43.556 --> 01:45.854
Just that Hobson said
not to get into any trouble.

01:46.025 --> 01:49.256
What trouble could possibly come
from a harmless game of dress-up?

01:49.428 --> 01:50.690
Hmm?

01:51.163 --> 01:52.187
Already bought the car.

02:00.272 --> 02:01.603
You think they're chasing us?

02:01.774 --> 02:04.937
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.

02:05.110 --> 02:07.044
Driver, pull the car over.

02:07.213 --> 02:08.270
How do you slow down?

02:11.750 --> 02:14.878
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
What do you suppose this does?

02:22.761 --> 02:23.785
Oh!
Ow!

02:34.907 --> 02:37.740
Ask the police for directions
to your mother's fundraiser.

02:37.910 --> 02:40.174
I think that problem
has been recently superseded.

02:40.346 --> 02:43.440
Tell them it's at a museum.
We destroyed a beloved landmark.

02:43.616 --> 02:45.083
It's around here somewhere.

02:45.251 --> 02:47.378
I need you to not to talk for a little while.

02:47.553 --> 02:50.647
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?

02:50.823 --> 02:52.154
You're drunk again, Arthur.

02:53.726 --> 02:57.822
No. I have remained drunk
since our last encounter.

02:57.997 --> 03:01.228
Let's go. Batman and Robin,
out of the car. Come on.

03:02.601 --> 03:06.059
Could I just point out
the elephant in the room?

03:06.238 --> 03:09.571
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.

03:09.742 --> 03:11.141
Okay, let's go. Come on.

03:11.310 --> 03:14.609
See, I don't like being this close
to these balls.

03:14.947 --> 03:16.278
I'll be right with you.

03:22.955 --> 03:24.013
Gotham is safe.

03:24.189 --> 03:25.281
Oh, man.

03:25.457 --> 03:28.893
If I could just write you a check
for the damage to your golden cow...

03:29.061 --> 03:31.325
...we can all be about our business.
Say no more.

03:31.497 --> 03:34.330
- Or not. Turn around. Come on.
What's it?

03:34.500 --> 03:35.990
- Are we going to prison?
Yes.

03:36.168 --> 03:38.636
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.

03:38.804 --> 03:41.500
Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.

03:41.907 --> 03:43.397
That's all well and good...

03:43.575 --> 03:46.806
...but it's not a market crash
we're concerned about.

03:46.979 --> 03:48.571
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.

03:50.282 --> 03:53.080
I do assure you that Arthur's
a bit more serious these days.

03:53.252 --> 03:56.050
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.

03:57.656 --> 03:59.681
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.

04:07.266 --> 04:10.997
I'm sorry, Vivienne. The university
cannot wager its endowment...

04:11.170 --> 04:14.833
...on a fund
with such an uncertain future.

04:23.415 --> 04:25.349
He's like a ship without an anchor.

04:27.319 --> 04:30.015
Maybe it's time we tied him
to another ship.

04:35.027 --> 04:39.589
Tito! Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.

04:39.765 --> 04:41.699
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?

04:41.867 --> 04:44.461
It seemed unfair that we'd leave
and that they'd remain.

04:44.636 --> 04:48.333
How do you explain
this frivolous spending during a recession?

04:48.741 --> 04:49.765
Fair point.

04:49.942 --> 04:51.375
Uh, recession...

04:53.112 --> 04:54.238
Free money!

04:55.814 --> 04:56.974
This is yours.

04:57.149 --> 04:59.777
Okay, recession's over! We're in a boom!

05:51.003 --> 05:53.130
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.

05:54.506 --> 05:57.066
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur. And friend.

05:57.242 --> 05:58.266
Tiffany.

05:58.444 --> 06:01.572
Oh, points for knowing her name
and saying it with confidence.

06:01.747 --> 06:04.307
I made a mental association
with my lamp.

06:04.483 --> 06:08.442
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson,
my best friend in the whole world.

06:08.620 --> 06:11.851
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.

06:12.024 --> 06:14.117
So how are you feeling
on the other side of...

06:14.293 --> 06:16.659
...that vast moat of champagne
called "last night"?

06:16.829 --> 06:17.853
Splendid.

06:18.030 --> 06:21.295
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.

06:22.067 --> 06:25.400
Vivienne? Why do you think
Vivienne wants to see me today?

06:25.571 --> 06:26.629
It doesn't make sense.

06:27.106 --> 06:29.336
After destroying
a world-famous landmark...

06:29.508 --> 06:34.002
...and giving away $78,000
from an ATM, I can't imagine.

06:34.179 --> 06:36.477
- Is she gonna stay here?
Um...

06:36.648 --> 06:39.583
...I wouldn't recommend letting him
get used to your breasts, dear.

06:39.751 --> 06:43.209
He's got an addictive personality,
you know. He was at mine till he was 6.

06:43.622 --> 06:44.884
Hobson.

06:45.057 --> 06:47.651
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples
to see him off.

06:47.826 --> 06:51.091
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.

06:51.263 --> 06:52.730
Hey, that's my purse.

06:52.898 --> 06:53.922
Oh.

06:54.099 --> 06:57.000
Look, I don't know how that
got in there. I don't know, Arthur.

06:57.169 --> 07:01.230
It's probably just one of those mysteries
that will never be discovered.

07:01.406 --> 07:03.306
JFK, who nicked my watch.

07:04.009 --> 07:06.876
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.

07:07.045 --> 07:09.013
Something of yours in your handbag.

07:09.181 --> 07:11.649
No, you don't have to
go through the pictures, actually.

07:11.817 --> 07:13.944
Arthur.
Oh, don't worry about all that.

07:14.119 --> 07:16.713
That's very rude. Invasion of privacy.

07:18.190 --> 07:21.387
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.

07:21.560 --> 07:25.189
Will you be requiring a taxi
or just getting into a random passing car?

07:25.797 --> 07:29.233
You guys are weird and racist.

07:29.401 --> 07:30.425
Bye-bye, Tiffany.

07:30.602 --> 07:33.662
I'll call you,
if you've not stolen my phone.

07:33.839 --> 07:38.105
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture
on your way out the door.

07:38.877 --> 07:40.970
Put it down.

07:43.182 --> 07:45.343
Say goodbye
to your other new friends now, Arthur.

07:45.517 --> 07:47.417
They have to go back to the real world.

07:47.586 --> 07:52.421
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson. I'll work
from bed today if you don't mind.

07:53.425 --> 07:54.619
Hobson.

07:55.093 --> 07:56.754
Breakfast, now.

08:10.943 --> 08:12.570
Here.

08:18.517 --> 08:20.212
Hobson!

08:21.420 --> 08:23.115
Hobson?

08:23.522 --> 08:26.889
Hobson! Hobson! Hobson!

08:27.059 --> 08:30.051
- Hobson! Hobson!
- What?

08:30.929 --> 08:34.126
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel,
61st and Park.

08:34.299 --> 08:35.698
Look.

08:43.808 --> 08:47.301
Hmm. Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.

08:49.815 --> 08:51.749
Wash your winkie. Thoroughly.

08:51.917 --> 08:56.149
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife
that girl was harboring between her thighs.

08:57.089 --> 09:00.923
Whoa, Hobson. You're missing Asian you.

09:02.694 --> 09:05.288
Ah! You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.

09:05.464 --> 09:08.524
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't. People work here.

09:08.700 --> 09:11.168
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.

09:11.336 --> 09:12.530
Silver lining.

09:23.782 --> 09:25.272
Mr. Bach?

09:25.450 --> 09:27.042
Your mother will see you now.

09:29.021 --> 09:32.889
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.

09:45.771 --> 09:47.500
Hello, Arthur.

09:48.140 --> 09:49.664
Oh, hello, Susan.

09:49.841 --> 09:54.676
I didn't see you there coming down this
long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor...

09:54.846 --> 09:56.814
...walking straight towards me.

09:57.849 --> 09:59.339
I owe you a call, don't I?

09:59.985 --> 10:02.010
From January.

10:02.688 --> 10:04.679
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.

10:04.856 --> 10:06.551
When Houdini did it, it was fun.

10:06.725 --> 10:08.022
Hmm.

10:08.193 --> 10:10.753
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.

10:10.929 --> 10:13.955
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.

10:16.168 --> 10:19.729
You know, you're the only man
I ever slept with who broke up with me.

10:20.472 --> 10:21.871
- Really?
- Really.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.337
Well, call me a romantic...

10:23.508 --> 10:27.774
...but I believe
that dating should involve crazy things...

10:27.946 --> 10:30.312
...like talking.
- Oh, ha, ha.

10:30.482 --> 10:33.542
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.

10:33.719 --> 10:35.619
Hunt me down with dogs.

10:36.588 --> 10:38.283
Good luck with your mother.

10:44.262 --> 10:45.957
Come in, Arthur.

10:46.531 --> 10:49.466
Oh, hello. The future's now.

10:49.768 --> 10:54.364
Hello, Vivienne. I remember you
from when I used to live in your womb.

10:57.008 --> 10:58.635
Arthur.

10:59.211 --> 11:01.679
Well, today, Arthur,
we're gonna have a friendly chat.

11:01.847 --> 11:03.371
Then a serious talk.

11:03.548 --> 11:06.073
And finally,
I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.

11:06.251 --> 11:07.582
How does all that sound?

11:07.753 --> 11:09.812
Like it would be improved by vodka.

11:09.988 --> 11:11.979
So I hear you've been having fun.

11:12.157 --> 11:14.785
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.

11:14.960 --> 11:19.397
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh,
I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.

11:19.564 --> 11:23.227
Thought he'd found a lump. Turned out
it was just his phone in his back pocket.

11:23.402 --> 11:24.767
But worrying time nonetheless.

11:26.138 --> 11:29.232
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm. Our best chat yet.

11:29.408 --> 11:32.343
I'm aware that our relationship
has never been ideal.

11:32.511 --> 11:33.671
Mm...

11:34.246 --> 11:36.407
No, please. Don't reproach yourself.

11:36.581 --> 11:39.072
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte...

11:39.251 --> 11:43.085
...but you did provide me with
that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.

11:43.255 --> 11:45.086
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.

11:45.257 --> 11:47.919
I'm gonna assume you mean Father
and not Mr. Tickles.

11:48.427 --> 11:50.122
So that he never had to see this.

11:52.330 --> 11:55.458
In fairness,
those two told me they were over 18.

11:55.634 --> 11:58.660
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.

11:59.070 --> 12:03.166
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough
around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?

12:03.575 --> 12:05.440
What forgivable antics.

12:05.610 --> 12:09.341
Who could be anything other than charmed
by this delightful individual?

12:10.115 --> 12:12.049
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander...

12:12.217 --> 12:15.948
...your considerable intelligence
on idiocy like this?

12:16.121 --> 12:19.352
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy...

12:19.524 --> 12:23.460
...rather a savantish gift
for defying death with fun.

12:23.628 --> 12:26.563
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?

12:26.731 --> 12:29.894
Yes, it is. Are we done?

12:30.101 --> 12:31.295
Sit down.

12:35.373 --> 12:40.936
When the sole heir of a corporation as big
as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.

12:41.112 --> 12:43.171
The nonsense has to stop.

12:43.548 --> 12:46.813
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman
who runs this country said...

12:46.985 --> 12:49.783
...the time has come
to set aside childish things.

12:49.955 --> 12:52.583
I don't think
you can say "coffee-colored. "

12:52.757 --> 12:55.123
So I've arrived at a solution.

12:55.393 --> 12:57.327
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.

12:57.496 --> 13:00.988
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.

13:01.166 --> 13:02.599
How is that a solution?

13:02.767 --> 13:05.099
You're going to marry her, Arthur.

13:05.704 --> 13:09.105
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.

13:11.176 --> 13:13.838
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.

13:14.679 --> 13:18.740
Capable woman, and quite willing to help
poor people if there's a camera nearby.

13:18.917 --> 13:22.182
Actually, if you want videos of Susan,
you should come to my apartment.

13:22.354 --> 13:25.812
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run...

13:25.991 --> 13:27.549
...by a Bach for generations.

13:27.726 --> 13:29.057
With Susan as one of us...

13:29.227 --> 13:33.789
...investors will be comforted to know the
line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.

13:33.965 --> 13:35.432
When did you become so cynical?

13:35.600 --> 13:39.730
Marriage isn't a tool
to protect a corporate image.

13:39.905 --> 13:42.271
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.000
If that's how you feel, Arthur,
you give me no choice.

13:45.176 --> 13:47.770
As of this moment, you are cut off.

13:48.713 --> 13:53.116
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?

13:54.185 --> 13:57.552
You don't mean cut off from the?

13:58.423 --> 14:00.482
The money, Arthur.

14:05.463 --> 14:09.524
No. I'm not gonna allow you
to manipulate me, Vivienne.

14:09.701 --> 14:11.828
I shall get married when I fall in love.

14:12.470 --> 14:15.928
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.

14:19.978 --> 14:22.776
Actually, Susan is a very special girl,
isn't she?

14:22.948 --> 14:26.179
With that mouth,
that velvety, beautiful mouth...

14:26.351 --> 14:27.784
...like a clown's mouth.

14:27.953 --> 14:31.582
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.

14:31.756 --> 14:33.690
And she'll make a wonderful wife.

14:33.858 --> 14:37.760
Yeah. I mean,
who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?

14:38.663 --> 14:40.858
Congratulations, Vivienne. You win.

14:41.566 --> 14:43.500
I don't respect you, Arthur...

14:43.668 --> 14:47.866
...but I do applaud your talent
for self-preservation.

14:48.039 --> 14:51.941
Congratulations. You're gonna be
a wealthy man for the rest of your life.

14:52.110 --> 14:54.635
That's all I've ever wanted to be.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.514
The ring your father
gave your mother, I believe.

15:05.423 --> 15:07.186
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.

15:08.627 --> 15:09.753
I don't like Susan.

15:09.928 --> 15:13.887
Well, I don't like you very much and we've
been happily stuck together for 30 years.

15:14.065 --> 15:17.432
I know it's not perfect,
but Susan is smart and capable...

15:17.602 --> 15:20.002
...and you need a woman like that
to look after you.

15:20.171 --> 15:25.074
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?

15:26.277 --> 15:31.613
Hobson, will you carry on
being my nanny?

15:32.150 --> 15:34.550
This is just my mother
trying to control me.

15:35.153 --> 15:37.178
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?

15:37.355 --> 15:39.220
I wanna squander some wealth.

15:39.391 --> 15:42.292
Ten thousand dollars
for this item from the czar's collection.

15:42.460 --> 15:46.760
Are we all done at 10,000? Ten thousand
dollars going once, going twice.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.532
Twenty thousand dollars of money!

15:50.702 --> 15:52.567
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.

15:52.737 --> 15:54.602
Thank you, sir. Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?

15:54.773 --> 15:56.638
Thirty thousand dollars, please.

15:56.808 --> 15:57.866
Thirty thousand.

15:58.043 --> 15:59.533
Thirty-five thousand.

15:59.711 --> 16:02.373
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?

16:02.547 --> 16:04.708
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.

16:04.883 --> 16:08.114
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.

16:08.286 --> 16:09.878
You've clearly never been to an auction.

16:10.055 --> 16:11.249
That's tit for tat.

16:11.423 --> 16:13.687
That's exactly how the situation
in the Middle East began.

16:13.858 --> 16:15.917
You leave me no choice.

16:16.094 --> 16:18.961
One hundred thousand dollars
and one penny...

16:19.130 --> 16:22.964
...because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.

16:23.134 --> 16:26.069
Well, that's the first sensible thing
you've said all day.

16:27.205 --> 16:31.699
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs
for $100,000 and one penny.

16:31.876 --> 16:33.935
- Thank you, sirs.
Congratulations.

16:34.379 --> 16:35.676
Hey, come on, Hobson.

16:35.847 --> 16:38.611
You know I've always coveted
the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.

16:38.783 --> 16:40.478
- Me too.
Oh.

16:41.052 --> 16:43.111
Our last item up for bid today:

16:43.288 --> 16:46.746
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln
delivered his second inaugural address.

16:47.759 --> 16:50.421
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?

16:50.795 --> 16:52.592
I'll take it.

16:52.764 --> 16:55.426
And the teleportation
device in which it stands.

16:56.768 --> 17:00.363
If you think this represents a victory
over your mother's financial tyranny...

17:00.538 --> 17:02.972
...you're deluded.
- Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.

17:03.141 --> 17:06.577
- Anytime. Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?

17:06.778 --> 17:09.041
He said he was gonna be
by the big gray thing.

17:09.214 --> 17:10.476
- Where?
- He said...

17:10.647 --> 17:13.481
...the big gray sculpture thing
with things on it.

17:13.651 --> 17:16.142
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.

17:16.320 --> 17:18.516
It's the blind leading the drunk.

17:18.690 --> 17:21.284
Hobson, you find Bitterman
while I wander off.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.160
Wow.

17:30.335 --> 17:31.359
What is this for?

17:31.936 --> 17:33.927
Where's everyone going?

17:34.105 --> 17:37.836
NAOMl: This is actually not Grand Central
Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.

17:38.009 --> 17:39.135
- Oh.
- Oh!

17:39.310 --> 17:42.711
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.

17:43.581 --> 17:46.982
Uh, I'm lost. Do you know where I can get
a drink, please?

17:47.152 --> 17:48.312
Um...

17:50.522 --> 17:51.955
This is really all I have.

17:52.557 --> 17:53.854
Good luck.

17:54.025 --> 17:55.117
- Come on.
- Coins.

17:55.293 --> 17:59.195
- I played with these when I was a boy.
NAOMl: Let's keep going. Time's a wasting.

17:59.364 --> 18:00.695
Speaking of time...

18:00.865 --> 18:04.824
...the clock behind me is one of the
most expensive clocks in the world.

18:12.043 --> 18:14.409
NAOMl: Thousands of people
pass through here every day...

18:14.579 --> 18:16.945
...and no one ever bothers to look up.

18:17.115 --> 18:20.812
It's magical. It's the only place
in Manhattan where you can see the stars.

18:20.985 --> 18:24.079
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.

18:25.690 --> 18:29.649
If you look in the corner you can see
one dirty brick...

18:29.828 --> 18:34.527
...and the whole ceiling used to be
like that until it was renovated in 1998.

18:34.699 --> 18:39.033
Wow, this is brilliant. If you like ceilings,
I've got a beautiful one above my bed.

18:40.405 --> 18:42.669
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that. It lights up.

18:42.841 --> 18:44.103
Thanks for that.

18:44.275 --> 18:47.676
If you direct your attention to the
opposite corner, you'll see a...

18:48.179 --> 18:51.012
...police officer.
- Miss, I warned you about this.

18:51.182 --> 18:53.912
You don't have a tour license
and now you're impeding foot traffic.

18:54.085 --> 18:55.484
Come on, up, up, everybody up.

18:55.653 --> 18:59.555
Officer, which law prevents
this radiant stranger...

18:59.724 --> 19:02.249
...from finding the magical
in the mundane?

19:02.427 --> 19:06.523
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?

19:08.766 --> 19:11.633
Hey. Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase. We're in a chase.

19:11.803 --> 19:13.361
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.

19:13.538 --> 19:14.562
Chase!

19:15.540 --> 19:18.065
My mind is racing. My heart is pounding.

19:18.243 --> 19:20.234
This is my first chase, and I love it.

19:21.312 --> 19:24.611
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
West on 42nd.

19:25.216 --> 19:26.979
This is what I live for!

19:27.151 --> 19:28.277
We've got a runner.

19:28.453 --> 19:30.853
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!

19:31.022 --> 19:32.717
Oh! I'm... I...

19:32.891 --> 19:37.385
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.

19:37.562 --> 19:40.258
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.

19:40.431 --> 19:43.423
Besides, you've had three warnings
for operating an illegal tour.

19:43.601 --> 19:46.069
Except this isn't an illegal tour...

19:46.237 --> 19:49.604
...because these people aren't tourists,
they're our family.

19:50.475 --> 19:52.841
Yes. They are, they're my family.

19:53.011 --> 19:55.070
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.

19:55.246 --> 19:58.579
Reunion. Uh, that, for example,
is Uncle Stuart waving there.

19:58.750 --> 20:00.945
NAOMl:
Yes. Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.

20:01.119 --> 20:04.145
Under that sun hat,
that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.

20:04.322 --> 20:06.790
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...

20:06.958 --> 20:09.188
NAOMl:
Uncle Korean John Lennon.

20:09.661 --> 20:12.027
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.

20:12.196 --> 20:13.663
- Oh, no.
No.

20:13.831 --> 20:18.768
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancé. I'm her fiancé.

20:18.937 --> 20:21.269
He is my fiancé.

20:23.408 --> 20:24.875
NAOMl:
Oh. Mm-hm.

20:27.779 --> 20:30.043
Darling, you don't want
these people to think...

20:30.214 --> 20:32.944
...that you're some kind of
random British pervert.

20:33.117 --> 20:37.281
No, I'm a very specific British pervert,
which is why you fell in love with me...

20:37.455 --> 20:40.390
...from our first date.
- Which was where, exactly?

20:41.793 --> 20:42.817
Grand Central.

20:42.994 --> 20:45.724
You had your first date
at Grand Central Station.

20:45.897 --> 20:50.459
It wasn't a shabby affair. I'd hired
out the entire place. It was deserted.

20:50.635 --> 20:53.399
Acrobats were in the place,
put on quite a show for us.

20:53.604 --> 20:55.037
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.

20:55.206 --> 20:57.401
The floor was strewn
with a million petals.

20:57.608 --> 21:00.168
Their scent hung in the air
like the sweet breath of angels.

21:00.345 --> 21:02.813
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?

21:02.981 --> 21:04.881
And ran nude through that concourse.

21:05.049 --> 21:07.574
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.

21:07.752 --> 21:09.481
- What'd you eat?
NAOMl: Oh.

21:09.654 --> 21:11.053
Oh, what was that?

21:11.222 --> 21:12.689
NAOMl: Pe...
Pe... Pe... Pe...

21:12.857 --> 21:13.881
PEZ.

21:14.058 --> 21:16.151
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?

21:16.327 --> 21:17.658
Actually, I do.

21:17.829 --> 21:21.196
Um, here you go. I think you'll find that
should do the trick.

21:21.366 --> 21:24.062
There's plenty more where that
came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?

21:24.235 --> 21:26.760
Ah. You keep it, Arthur,
and thank you for the show.

21:28.439 --> 21:31.169
- Naomi, get a license. Good luck.
NAOMl: Okay.

21:32.343 --> 21:34.675
What was that? Who are you?

21:34.846 --> 21:38.782
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger
with a crazy hat.

21:38.950 --> 21:40.884
Oh, my God.

21:42.186 --> 21:46.316
Arthur, your safari into the pointless
ends now. Get in the car.

21:46.491 --> 21:49.756
No. It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.

21:49.927 --> 21:53.419
Yes, I can. I work for his mother.
Get in the car. Bitterman, open the door.

21:54.732 --> 21:57.667
Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.

21:57.835 --> 21:59.735
- Not you, Bitterman.
Yes, you, Bitterman.

21:59.904 --> 22:02.930
I'm sorry. Who are you people?

22:03.107 --> 22:04.438
I'm his nanny.

22:05.643 --> 22:06.940
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.

22:07.111 --> 22:11.445
Well, I have to get back to our confused
family over there, so have a nice day.

22:11.616 --> 22:12.947
Oh, hang... Uh, excuse me.

22:13.751 --> 22:16.948
Naomi Quinn,
I'd like to see you again.

22:17.121 --> 22:20.557
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
Very wise choice.

22:20.725 --> 22:23.660
You're not the first woman
who walks the streets for a living...

22:23.828 --> 22:25.295
...that he's taken a liking to.

22:26.931 --> 22:28.296
Is she always with you?

22:30.768 --> 22:35.102
Okay. 917-176-2030.

22:35.273 --> 22:37.935
- Uh... Did you remember that?
- No.

22:44.482 --> 22:45.813
Arthur, get in the car.

22:47.118 --> 22:51.987
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because
I want to, not because you have told me to.

22:52.323 --> 22:53.756
Distinction.

22:53.925 --> 22:55.187
Bitterman.

22:55.793 --> 22:59.820
It was magical. We ran
from the police, then we lied to them.

22:59.997 --> 23:02.989
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
I believe I have.

23:04.368 --> 23:08.600
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched
opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.

23:08.773 --> 23:10.434
- She could be the one.
Yes.

23:10.608 --> 23:13.338
Oh. I'm so sorry. That went
right through your guard.

23:13.511 --> 23:15.672
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.

23:15.847 --> 23:17.371
What I like about her, Naomi...

23:17.548 --> 23:20.108
...is she's got a very unique way
of seeing the world.

23:20.284 --> 23:21.546
So do flies.

23:21.719 --> 23:25.519
This is a repeat of when you were certain
you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.

23:25.690 --> 23:29.182
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.658
The brute had no regard
for fashion, Evander.

23:31.829 --> 23:34.889
No, because you were from two
different worlds, the same as this girl.

23:35.066 --> 23:38.263
Listen, could you just let me focus
on my jab and refresh me, please?

23:40.004 --> 23:43.064
- Aah! That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?

23:43.641 --> 23:47.668
No, but I think some of it probably went
in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.

23:48.079 --> 23:50.138
- Get dressed.
- Why?

23:50.314 --> 23:52.646
Because at 3:00
you're going to ask Burt Johnson...

23:52.817 --> 23:54.751
...for his daughter's hand in marriage.

23:54.919 --> 23:58.252
I will do no such thing. I'm going to
remain here and box with Evander.

23:58.422 --> 24:01.550
And then I shall have my music lesson
with Kanye West as planned.

24:01.926 --> 24:03.484
Out, now.

24:05.997 --> 24:07.726
Make me.

24:11.035 --> 24:12.764
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.

24:12.937 --> 24:14.905
Use the old rope-a-dope,
I should think.

24:15.072 --> 24:18.269
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married...

24:18.442 --> 24:21.434
...you're going to have to stop this
obsession with random women.

24:21.612 --> 24:24.103
She is not a random woman,
she understands me.

24:24.282 --> 24:28.548
She laughs at my jokes. She's like you, but
with a more appropriate potential for sex.

24:31.122 --> 24:35.616
Ow! That really hurt. Evander,
you assured me I was indestructible.

24:35.793 --> 24:37.886
Burt Johnson, 3:00.

24:38.496 --> 24:43.661
Evander, if he's not out of this ring
in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.

25:01.919 --> 25:04.149
What am I doing here, Bitterman?

25:04.589 --> 25:07.717
Uh, you asked me to drive you
to the Burt Johnson Tower.

25:09.961 --> 25:12.828
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.

25:13.097 --> 25:14.928
That's very flattering.

25:15.099 --> 25:18.899
But if you were me
and you were in this situation...

25:19.070 --> 25:21.265
...what would you do? What should I say?

25:21.439 --> 25:27.002
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um,
"Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.

25:28.312 --> 25:29.973
But I love your daughter. "

25:30.147 --> 25:33.412
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.

25:34.619 --> 25:36.018
You've been very helpful.

25:37.888 --> 25:40.152
Put this on. Wait here.

25:40.324 --> 25:42.417
It's the same as your one.

25:42.593 --> 25:44.959
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.

25:53.371 --> 25:55.430
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!

26:06.417 --> 26:08.715
Bloody hell.

26:08.986 --> 26:10.817
It's an apocalyptic future.

26:10.988 --> 26:14.355
The Upper East Side lay
in absolute ruin.

26:14.525 --> 26:16.686
The machines have taken over, as usual.

26:16.861 --> 26:18.726
Ah, malevolent toaster.

26:18.929 --> 26:21.830
Only one man can save civilization.

26:21.999 --> 26:24.832
And that man is Arthur Bach.

26:25.002 --> 26:26.970
Justice!

26:40.184 --> 26:41.208
Hello, Arthur.

26:41.385 --> 26:45.719
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?

26:45.890 --> 26:48.825
One of these guns what makes nails
come out of it.

26:48.993 --> 26:53.327
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.

26:53.764 --> 26:55.356
It's a good gun.

26:55.533 --> 26:59.128
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.

27:00.171 --> 27:02.435
Do you know you've got nails sticking
in you?

27:02.606 --> 27:05.040
Framing nails.

27:05.409 --> 27:07.434
Standard.

27:08.779 --> 27:11.509
Well, I love what
you've done with the place, Burt.

27:11.682 --> 27:14.708
It reminds me of a gay club
I went to once in Copenhagen.

27:14.885 --> 27:17.183
This is gonna be my new office.

27:17.621 --> 27:19.646
Oh, my God. I live right over there.

27:21.192 --> 27:24.491
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.

27:25.296 --> 27:26.388
And frightening.

27:26.564 --> 27:30.557
Did you put this building here just
so you can spy on me?

27:30.735 --> 27:32.100
Mm-hm.

27:33.871 --> 27:35.736
Shouldn't you be getting
to the hospital?

27:35.906 --> 27:41.105
If I ran off to the hospital every
time I got a little boo-boo...

27:41.278 --> 27:43.109
Yeah. What's a nail through the body?

27:43.280 --> 27:44.975
Made a hero out of Jesus.

27:45.149 --> 27:48.243
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel
a bit queasy.

27:48.419 --> 27:51.320
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh...

27:51.489 --> 27:53.582
...and now I own skyscrapers.

27:53.758 --> 27:56.283
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.

27:56.460 --> 27:58.360
I took them.

27:59.330 --> 28:00.388
But you know...

28:01.832 --> 28:07.464
...I'm actually fine
with my little girl marrying you.

28:07.938 --> 28:09.337
Do you know why?

28:09.507 --> 28:11.907
Because you've lost a lot of blood
and you're disoriented?

28:12.076 --> 28:15.443
My little Susan can turn you around.

28:15.613 --> 28:20.243
You know, she once bought a crack house
and turned it into a condo.

28:20.418 --> 28:22.784
That's funny,
I once did the exact opposite.

28:23.087 --> 28:28.150
Now, you listen to me carefully. I need
to trust that you'll do what she says.

28:28.325 --> 28:29.451
- Yes.
- Table saw.

28:30.828 --> 28:33.524
Most dangerous piece of equipment
on a job site.

28:33.697 --> 28:36.689
Hands five inches on either
side of the blade and you'll be fine.

28:36.867 --> 28:40.200
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on. You can do it.

28:40.371 --> 28:42.032
No... Just, uh... Just push it through.

28:46.811 --> 28:50.042
I did it, Burt! I did a man thing!
That was incredible.

28:50.214 --> 28:52.978
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?

28:53.517 --> 28:54.643
My finger?

28:54.819 --> 28:58.983
It's okay, the saw has a safety
device. It detects moisture.

28:59.156 --> 29:03.718
Anything containing moisture touches
that blade, and bam, it'll stop.

29:03.894 --> 29:06.294
That sounds a little bit risky
to me, Burt.

29:06.464 --> 29:07.795
Use your tongue.

29:08.632 --> 29:11.157
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.

29:11.335 --> 29:13.667
Oh, no. I don't think
I should do that, Burt.

29:13.838 --> 29:17.205
I think I'd like to go back over there
now to house.

29:17.374 --> 29:19.740
- No, Burt! What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!

29:19.910 --> 29:22.504
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.

29:22.680 --> 29:25.205
You need to stick out your tongue
or it won't sense the moisture.

29:26.584 --> 29:28.176
I want my nanny.

29:50.774 --> 29:54.710
Mr. Johnson,
a very wise man once said:

29:54.879 --> 29:59.339
"I like your tower,
but I love your daughter. "

29:59.517 --> 30:01.178
Can I marry her, please?

30:01.352 --> 30:03.513
Sure.

30:06.557 --> 30:09.355
Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
Excellent choice.

30:09.527 --> 30:12.690
Could you tell Jerome, please,
that it was a little dry last time?

30:12.863 --> 30:14.296
I will see to it.
- Thank you.

30:14.465 --> 30:18.196
For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.

30:20.704 --> 30:22.729
I hear you have something to ask me.

30:22.907 --> 30:24.738
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.

30:24.909 --> 30:27.707
Would you mind telling me what
the bloody hell's been going on?

30:27.878 --> 30:30.745
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.

30:30.915 --> 30:33.543
You don't understand
that there's a macabre conspiracy...

30:33.717 --> 30:36.311
...to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...

30:36.487 --> 30:38.751
- "Loveless marriage. "
- We should not get married.

30:38.923 --> 30:41.153
We don't have anything in common,
do we?

30:41.325 --> 30:45.785
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal? I think that's really cruel.

30:45.963 --> 30:47.828
Do you like it because it's cruel?

30:48.499 --> 30:51.093
We don't like the same people, music.

30:51.268 --> 30:53.065
You love horses.

30:53.237 --> 30:54.795
- I do.
I don't trust them.

30:54.972 --> 30:57.133
Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.

30:57.308 --> 31:00.766
- This is a business... Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.

31:00.945 --> 31:03.812
All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?

31:03.981 --> 31:07.974
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.

31:09.353 --> 31:11.184
This is all it is,
it's a business partnership.

31:11.355 --> 31:14.324
With the added benefit of attraction.

31:15.159 --> 31:19.459
Undeniably, you have got something
dark and twisted in you.

31:19.630 --> 31:23.088
And for awhile,
I thought I might be able to bugger it out.

31:23.267 --> 31:26.031
But I tried really hard
and I think it's still in there.

31:26.203 --> 31:29.195
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring,
and say four little words.

31:29.373 --> 31:32.001
Okay. Uh, I don't love you.

31:32.176 --> 31:33.268
Try again.

31:34.011 --> 31:35.376
I like other girls.

31:35.546 --> 31:39.778
- Oh, well, me too. Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you. Daily.

31:39.950 --> 31:43.647
For example, look, I'm quite capable
of this kind of conduct.

31:43.821 --> 31:44.845
I've seen it before.

31:46.223 --> 31:47.281
All right. Yes.

31:48.626 --> 31:52.118
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.

31:55.899 --> 31:59.665
There. Hmm? What do you think
about that? She's probably pregnant.

32:00.037 --> 32:02.631
- Well done. Go on.
- Okay.

32:03.140 --> 32:04.903
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.

32:05.075 --> 32:06.667
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?

32:08.045 --> 32:09.376
I'm a naughty robot.

32:09.546 --> 32:11.673
- But I just love him.
I've got tin titties.

32:11.849 --> 32:15.717
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.

32:17.087 --> 32:19.851
I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.

32:20.024 --> 32:23.221
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun
in that bloody kitchen.

32:23.994 --> 32:27.760
Daddy did, uh, show you
his little table saw, didn't he?

32:31.502 --> 32:35.029
Turn around and tell everyone you're
crazy when you're in love. Ready? Go.

32:36.006 --> 32:40.033
I don't know why I did all of those things
just then. I go crazy when I'm in love.

32:43.580 --> 32:44.672
Sit down. Great.

32:44.848 --> 32:46.713
Help me. Help me.

32:49.019 --> 32:53.319
Embarrassing me or your family
is the one thing that will not be tolerated.

32:53.490 --> 32:55.287
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.

32:55.459 --> 33:00.453
Sweet boy, this can all be
a ton of fun if you let it.

33:05.769 --> 33:07.066
Shall we try again?

33:09.239 --> 33:13.039
On one knee. I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.

33:15.212 --> 33:17.612
Susan. Pfft.

33:17.781 --> 33:20.773
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.

33:21.251 --> 33:23.549
I wish I was,
because I'd let me get away.

33:23.721 --> 33:25.484
Ask me. Ask me.

33:26.423 --> 33:27.822
Have it. Go on.

33:28.292 --> 33:29.554
Yes, Arthur.

33:31.295 --> 33:32.853
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.

33:39.670 --> 33:41.160
Ah!

34:04.828 --> 34:06.022
Aspirin.

34:08.098 --> 34:10.065
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.

34:10.234 --> 34:13.293
You're gonna be looked after
and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.

34:13.469 --> 34:18.339
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.

34:18.509 --> 34:21.376
That's because they're far away
or you've given them money.

34:22.513 --> 34:24.310
What do you know, Alfred?

34:25.181 --> 34:28.447
Arthur, poor people have to work.

34:28.619 --> 34:32.715
They have to stand in the rain waiting for
buses to take them to things called jobs...

34:32.889 --> 34:36.053
...which they have to do all year round
for holidays away from those jobs.

34:36.226 --> 34:41.027
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.

34:41.197 --> 34:42.722
I model riding boots, don't I?

34:43.367 --> 34:48.202
Posing in riding boots for another pampered
prick is not a job. Now take your vitamin.

34:56.746 --> 34:59.147
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.

34:59.316 --> 35:01.375
We'll unravel
this engagement bollocks later.

35:01.552 --> 35:05.579
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.

35:06.557 --> 35:08.457
Be a man.

35:18.569 --> 35:21.197
NAOMl: Continuing on,
this is Grand Central Terminal...

35:21.371 --> 35:25.501
...and it is home to more
than 750,000 commuters a day.

35:25.676 --> 35:28.668
Boring. What a tiresome fact that was.

35:29.112 --> 35:33.515
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a
classic New York architectural feature:

35:33.684 --> 35:36.050
The man who takes your number
and then never calls you.

35:36.220 --> 35:37.244
Ooh.

35:37.421 --> 35:39.889
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored...

35:40.057 --> 35:44.426
...the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.

35:44.595 --> 35:46.119
Okay, well, what about this:

35:46.296 --> 35:48.264
See that clock up there?
See those statues?

35:48.432 --> 35:51.560
That's Jupiter and Minerva
and Hercules.

35:51.735 --> 35:54.602
When the clock strikes 12,
they reach down and they stop time.

35:54.771 --> 35:58.639
And then they go out on the town. They go
swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.

35:58.809 --> 36:02.108
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.

36:02.279 --> 36:04.144
Okay, guys,
that's the end of your tour. Um...

36:04.314 --> 36:07.909
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.

36:09.820 --> 36:11.879
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.

36:12.055 --> 36:14.023
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...

36:14.191 --> 36:15.852
We're on a tight schedule. Come.

36:16.026 --> 36:17.152
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.

36:23.367 --> 36:26.632
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?

36:26.803 --> 36:31.069
The people have been rerouted
for 45 minutes by me for you.

36:32.142 --> 36:37.375
It's sort of romantic, but in another way,
it's incredibly selfish of you.

36:38.982 --> 36:41.041
Grand Central.

36:42.052 --> 36:44.350
Rose petals.

36:44.521 --> 36:47.115
Dinner. Oh, my God.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.587
This is our first date.

36:51.762 --> 36:55.596
Oh, is that what we said to the police
officer? I'd quite forgotten.

36:56.099 --> 36:58.590
NAOMl:
Wait, I'm not getting naked.

36:58.769 --> 37:02.500
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes
some of the pizzazz out of the evening.

37:02.673 --> 37:04.698
It's like we're the last people
on the planet.

37:05.442 --> 37:09.674
Wow, this is amazing. Thank you.

37:16.620 --> 37:19.748
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.

37:20.123 --> 37:22.216
NAOMl:
He's in formal attire.

37:22.693 --> 37:24.627
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.

37:32.636 --> 37:34.331
Excellent.

37:36.073 --> 37:38.667
- Your dinner, madam.
NAOMl: Thank you.

37:39.743 --> 37:41.711
PEZ.

37:42.646 --> 37:47.549
These are us as PEZ heads? Ha, ha.

37:47.718 --> 37:50.084
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.

37:50.253 --> 37:51.413
NAOMl:
Do you want me?

37:51.588 --> 37:52.885
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.

37:54.725 --> 37:56.488
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you...

37:56.660 --> 37:59.595
...I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks
out of your neck hole.

37:59.763 --> 38:00.855
You're not the first.

38:02.432 --> 38:04.923
What do you think? Do you like it?

38:05.202 --> 38:08.171
Well, on my last date...

38:08.338 --> 38:12.399
...the guy told me that I could only
eat salad and then he said he was gay.

38:12.576 --> 38:13.702
- This is better.
Yeah.

38:13.877 --> 38:15.606
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...

38:15.779 --> 38:16.803
Oh, already winning.

38:18.181 --> 38:20.775
Did you know that the zodiac
is painted on backwards?

38:20.951 --> 38:24.944
It was a goof by the artist, but then the
Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place...

38:25.122 --> 38:27.488
...said that it was God's view
of the heavens.

38:27.691 --> 38:30.091
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world
from God's perspective.

38:32.195 --> 38:33.890
There's a woman jumping behind you.

38:34.231 --> 38:37.132
Oh, yeah. I promised you acrobats.

38:40.837 --> 38:43.704
NAOMl:
Arthur, this is... This is insane.

38:43.874 --> 38:46.274
Yeah, this is what money is for.

38:46.443 --> 38:51.972
Creating excitement and joy
and acrobats and PEZ heads and...

38:53.250 --> 38:54.308
Italy.

38:54.651 --> 38:56.414
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.

38:56.586 --> 38:59.054
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?

38:59.222 --> 39:05.422
- Tonight. I'll charter a jet. Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.

39:05.829 --> 39:07.558
Excuse me.

39:07.731 --> 39:08.789
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?

39:08.965 --> 39:10.865
...I'm talking about Tuscany.

39:11.034 --> 39:14.834
White truffle gelato. Have you ever
tasted white truffle gelato?

39:15.005 --> 39:17.166
It makes all other gelato
taste like shit.

39:17.340 --> 39:21.800
Arthur, you emptied out
Grand Central Station.

39:23.513 --> 39:25.413
Can't you just be here?

39:29.453 --> 39:31.114
Can I show you something?

39:33.156 --> 39:35.181
NAOMl: After we moved to New York
when I was 11...

39:35.358 --> 39:37.656
...my mom used to bring me down here
all the time.

39:37.828 --> 39:40.797
We'd take the train in from Queens.

39:40.964 --> 39:44.661
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.

39:44.835 --> 39:48.396
Okay, you have to go in that corner,
and I'll be over here.

39:48.572 --> 39:50.665
And say something.

39:50.841 --> 39:52.001
What?

39:52.375 --> 39:53.603
I don't know, anything.

39:53.910 --> 39:58.677
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out,
like you failed to do.

39:59.649 --> 40:01.549
Good idea.

40:04.721 --> 40:07.986
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?

40:08.158 --> 40:10.285
Yes, this is Naomi.

40:10.594 --> 40:14.394
My God, that's amazing. You're over there,
but I can hear you perfectly over here.

40:14.564 --> 40:17.032
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.

40:17.434 --> 40:18.833
I'm gonna buy one of these.

40:19.202 --> 40:21.727
You don't have to buy it, it's free.

40:22.072 --> 40:23.903
Incredible.

40:24.808 --> 40:26.969
I was just having a phone call,
so I've gotta go back.

40:27.144 --> 40:28.406
Oh.

40:29.713 --> 40:35.049
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like
to maybe go on a date with me?

40:37.554 --> 40:42.048
NAOMl: Actually, I'm free right now
if you'd like to do something simple.

40:42.225 --> 40:44.318
Food, my house?

40:54.604 --> 40:55.832
What is this, please?

40:56.740 --> 41:01.040
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.

41:01.211 --> 41:06.513
Yeah. It's one of the few times the generic
brand's actually better than the real thing.

41:06.683 --> 41:09.049
Something happens in the factory.

41:10.887 --> 41:12.081
It's delicious.

41:12.255 --> 41:13.950
Welcome to the life of humans.

41:14.124 --> 41:16.490
It is the culinary success of the season.

41:18.161 --> 41:19.719
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

41:19.896 --> 41:22.023
What?
- My dad is asleep.

41:22.199 --> 41:24.793
But your mum wears earplugs,
so we don't need to worry about her.

41:24.968 --> 41:27.903
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.

41:28.071 --> 41:30.596
Naked. Sleeping au naturel.

41:30.774 --> 41:32.139
She's dead.

41:33.877 --> 41:34.901
I'm so sorry.

41:35.445 --> 41:38.073
She died, um, last year.

41:38.248 --> 41:42.378
It's really recent, and I made a joke about
your dead nude mum. I'm so sorry, Naomi.

41:42.552 --> 41:46.215
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.

41:46.790 --> 41:50.954
If it's any consolation,
my dad is similarly deceased.

41:51.127 --> 41:52.924
I'm so sorry. Was that recent?

41:53.096 --> 41:57.055
No, it was when I was a child,
so you've won that round, but, uh...

41:57.234 --> 41:59.065
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.

41:59.236 --> 42:02.000
You're winning,
but it's not too late for me to run home...

42:02.172 --> 42:04.697
...and butcher my mother
just to edge into the lead.

42:04.874 --> 42:07.172
Uh, no. My dad died when I was a kid.

42:07.344 --> 42:11.337
He was by all accounts a very
sensible, uh, frugal man...

42:11.514 --> 42:13.778
...who didn't drink, didn't smoke,
walked everywhere.

42:13.950 --> 42:14.974
NAOMl:
Hmm.

42:15.151 --> 42:18.348
Dropped dead of a heart attack
when he was 44.

42:18.521 --> 42:21.217
Lesson being,
why bother taking care of yourself?

42:21.424 --> 42:23.358
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.

42:23.526 --> 42:25.084
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.

42:25.262 --> 42:26.286
Mm.

42:28.531 --> 42:29.828
Ah.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.627
No, thanks.

42:32.435 --> 42:33.868
What were you like as a kid?

42:34.037 --> 42:37.302
Well, ha, ha, aside from being
grief-stricken...

42:37.474 --> 42:40.238
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little...

42:40.443 --> 42:42.308
...and I didn't drink so much then.

42:42.479 --> 42:45.710
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?

42:45.882 --> 42:47.110
Strictly juice boxes.

42:47.284 --> 42:49.252
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.

42:49.452 --> 42:51.579
I thought that the moon
followed me everywhere.

42:51.755 --> 42:53.848
I thought it meant something special
was gonna happen.

42:54.224 --> 42:57.057
Well, that's a pretty
ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi...

42:57.227 --> 43:00.560
...because by that notion,
the moon would be out there right n...

43:01.931 --> 43:05.389
Naomi, the moon is literally out there
right now spying on us...

43:05.568 --> 43:09.334
...his light shining down on your face
and clutter.

43:09.506 --> 43:11.098
What is all these things?

43:13.376 --> 43:14.638
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.

43:15.245 --> 43:19.272
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying
around in here young la... What's this for?

43:19.482 --> 43:21.177
- That's nothing. That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:21.351 --> 43:23.911
This is not nothing. This is something.

43:25.588 --> 43:28.955
I used to write stories
and draw pictures for kids.

43:29.125 --> 43:30.149
Ah.

43:30.894 --> 43:31.918
Wow.

43:32.095 --> 43:35.189
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled
all the way from France.

43:35.365 --> 43:39.358
She missed her friend,
the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt. "

43:39.536 --> 43:42.061
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.

43:42.238 --> 43:45.696
In this, the Statue of Liberty
is a lonely French giant.

43:46.109 --> 43:50.705
Yeah. And she stays lonely until
she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.

43:51.548 --> 43:52.879
That's brilliant, Naomi.

43:54.250 --> 43:57.913
You should quit your job
and focus all your energy on this.

43:58.088 --> 43:59.988
- I can't.
- Why? What have you got to lose?

44:00.156 --> 44:01.885
The house and electricity and...

44:02.058 --> 44:04.788
You can pay for all those things
when this is published.

44:05.762 --> 44:10.222
Arthur, things like that don't happen
to people like me.

44:10.934 --> 44:13.402
Then why is the moon
still following you?

44:18.074 --> 44:20.201
But this doesn't wake your father?

44:20.810 --> 44:24.803
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.

44:24.981 --> 44:26.005
From his grave.

44:28.618 --> 44:30.848
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.

44:31.020 --> 44:33.614
All right. Smile, Daddy, smile.

44:33.923 --> 44:36.255
Okay, and now,
I'd love to see some more love.

44:38.795 --> 44:40.319
What is this?

44:40.497 --> 44:42.465
Your engagement photo
for Town & Country.

44:42.632 --> 44:44.497
How about a couple
of you and your mum?

44:44.834 --> 44:46.324
Oh, all right, yeah. Okay.

44:46.503 --> 44:47.936
All right.

44:48.505 --> 44:50.496
Vivienne?
Yes, Arthur?

44:50.673 --> 44:51.970
If hypothetically...

44:52.142 --> 44:56.476
...uh, I was to develop feelings
for a woman who isn't exactly Susan...

44:56.646 --> 44:59.843
...kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan,
as it were...

45:00.016 --> 45:03.611
...um, how would that make you feel,
hypothetically?

45:03.787 --> 45:06.551
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.

45:06.723 --> 45:09.123
But unfortunately,
the most magical relationships...

45:09.292 --> 45:11.522
...will wilt in the midst
of grinding poverty.

45:11.694 --> 45:13.992
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you...

45:14.164 --> 45:16.155
...and your future father-in-law?
- What? No, no.

45:16.332 --> 45:18.129
- Ha, ha. Hello, Burt.
Hello.

45:20.170 --> 45:22.468
I'll never get used to
that handshake.

45:22.939 --> 45:24.839
Where were you last night, Arthur?

45:25.008 --> 45:26.373
What? Just at home. Home.

45:26.543 --> 45:28.170
You sure about that?

45:28.344 --> 45:30.141
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.

45:30.313 --> 45:31.974
- Oh, Jesus.
Oh, great.

45:32.148 --> 45:35.549
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.

45:35.718 --> 45:37.015
Get on the horse, Arthur.

45:37.187 --> 45:40.213
I love animals, but I don't trust you.

45:40.390 --> 45:41.516
Get on the horse.

45:42.158 --> 45:44.388
You will not make me cry today.

45:44.561 --> 45:48.497
For the riding boot shoots, we use
a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.

45:48.665 --> 45:50.565
- Maybe Daddy could help?
Yeah, let me help.

45:50.733 --> 45:52.633
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.

45:52.802 --> 45:55.771
You're a weak man, Burt. Burt.
No, Burt, you're... That doesn't help.

45:55.939 --> 45:58.806
Ow! Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.

45:58.975 --> 46:00.602
Aah! Ha, ha.

46:00.777 --> 46:02.745
That was no trouble. That was no tr...

46:02.912 --> 46:05.972
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.

46:06.149 --> 46:07.673
Okay, lovely.

46:08.051 --> 46:09.746
Who is she, Arthur?

46:10.420 --> 46:13.617
I don't know, I imagine she's called
Trixy or Rocket. Something like that.

46:13.790 --> 46:15.758
Not the horse. The girl.

46:15.925 --> 46:17.790
I don't know what you mean.

46:17.961 --> 46:19.826
We'll be right back. Excuse us.

46:21.297 --> 46:23.231
Wha? Aah! I didn't agree to this.

46:23.399 --> 46:25.867
First your father, now the horse.

46:26.035 --> 46:28.731
When will my testicles get some rest?

46:29.038 --> 46:33.566
Delaying a hundred commuter trains
for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.

46:33.743 --> 46:35.506
It was in The Times and the Post.

46:35.678 --> 46:39.136
I must've hurt you with that. I understand
if you wanna cancel the wedding.

46:39.315 --> 46:42.910
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled. End of story.

46:43.286 --> 46:47.347
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?

46:47.524 --> 46:51.392
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.

46:51.728 --> 46:55.425
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.

46:55.598 --> 46:58.158
I'll draw you one. It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.

46:58.334 --> 46:59.892
I hear them whisper at functions.

47:00.069 --> 47:03.266
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter
of a contractor from Pittsburgh.

47:03.439 --> 47:04.565
They sneer when I walk past.

47:04.741 --> 47:07.710
That's probably just because
of who you are as a person.

47:13.283 --> 47:16.081
Bach Worldwide has been run
by a Bach for generations.

47:16.419 --> 47:19.820
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control
of one of the largest trusts in the world.

47:19.989 --> 47:23.117
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.

47:23.293 --> 47:27.252
But Vivienne. Susienne. Satan. Susan.
I like this girl.

47:27.430 --> 47:30.991
We connect, she and I.
She's spontaneous and...

47:31.167 --> 47:32.828
I'm spontaneous.

47:33.002 --> 47:35.937
Really? You planned to confront me
during a contrived photo shoot...

47:36.105 --> 47:38.266
...wearing an outfit you selected
when you were a child.

47:38.441 --> 47:39.465
Ow!

47:39.742 --> 47:42.108
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?

47:42.278 --> 47:44.974
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.

47:45.148 --> 47:46.274
You embarrassed me.

47:46.449 --> 47:48.280
Embarrass me again
and my father will cut off...

47:48.451 --> 47:49.509
I know, my tongue.

47:49.719 --> 47:51.311
No, your balls.

47:51.654 --> 47:53.019
Not if I keep them moist.

47:59.862 --> 48:01.625
Thoughts, Hobnobs?

48:01.798 --> 48:05.256
I think you're engaged, and going out
with Naomi is a really bad idea.

48:05.435 --> 48:06.459
Exactly.

48:07.837 --> 48:11.034
Which is why I've invited her here.

48:13.176 --> 48:14.643
Arthur, think.

48:14.811 --> 48:18.440
I have thinked. And that is why we're
all gonna hang out together.

48:18.615 --> 48:21.516
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.

48:21.684 --> 48:24.482
Hobson, if you get to know this girl,
you're gonna love her.

48:24.654 --> 48:26.986
Arthur, you must tell Naomi
you're getting married.

48:27.156 --> 48:30.319
You don't think that might rather
mar the romance of the evening?

48:30.827 --> 48:31.851
Hello, Arthur.

48:33.396 --> 48:37.196
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan. How nice to see you.

48:37.367 --> 48:39.460
Can you just give us one
little minute?

48:40.903 --> 48:43.030
Yes, of course.

48:43.206 --> 48:45.333
Thank you.

48:47.944 --> 48:49.502
Mm-mm.

48:50.847 --> 48:53.179
- What was that?
- A French kiss.

48:53.349 --> 48:55.340
Really? Because the French
always surrender.

48:55.518 --> 48:56.985
That was decidedly German.

48:57.153 --> 48:59.212
I was just at home
feeling spontaneous.

48:59.722 --> 49:02.190
I decided to put on
a little something spontaneous...

49:02.358 --> 49:05.293
...and come over here spontaneously.

49:05.495 --> 49:09.295
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.

49:12.802 --> 49:18.536
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?

49:18.708 --> 49:20.005
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.

49:20.176 --> 49:22.576
So you just, uh... You wait here. Oh, no.

49:23.946 --> 49:25.914
Oh-ho. Lovely. That's come off.

49:26.082 --> 49:29.108
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?

49:29.285 --> 49:31.981
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.

49:32.155 --> 49:33.622
Hurry.

49:36.459 --> 49:38.450
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.

49:38.628 --> 49:39.754
- You are?
Um...

49:41.397 --> 49:43.092
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.

49:43.266 --> 49:46.599
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse
or did she surrender her dress willingly?

49:47.370 --> 49:49.736
If it makes you feel better,
she didn't suffer.

49:50.006 --> 49:52.941
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi. Come in.

49:53.109 --> 49:55.077
Now, I know we were gonna
have a night in...

49:55.244 --> 49:58.179
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we?

49:58.347 --> 50:00.611
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no. Um...

50:00.783 --> 50:03.377
- That fish looks like a cat.
Naomi. No, it doesn't.

50:03.553 --> 50:05.783
NAOMl: Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.

50:05.955 --> 50:08.651
Now, tell me where the room
filled with buckets of gold is.

50:08.825 --> 50:11.157
It's over here,
away from the bedroom, actually.

50:11.327 --> 50:13.727
You have a glittery camel. Why?

50:13.896 --> 50:15.625
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.

50:15.798 --> 50:20.667
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the
apartment while Arthur primps himself.

50:20.837 --> 50:22.998
I'll be primping. I've gotta primp.

50:23.172 --> 50:26.107
NAOMl: Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.

50:27.176 --> 50:30.043
Ah, Susan.

50:31.814 --> 50:33.645
You're posing suggestively.

50:33.816 --> 50:36.341
Do you like it, my fiancé?

50:37.453 --> 50:38.477
Buckets of gold?

50:38.654 --> 50:41.145
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.

50:41.324 --> 50:45.124
Come through here. This should keep your
eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.

50:46.496 --> 50:48.760
Get out.

50:48.931 --> 50:52.389
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.

50:52.568 --> 50:53.830
Are these always playing?

50:54.238 --> 50:57.799
No, it, uh, alternates between this
and historical documentaries.

50:58.242 --> 51:01.541
- Really?
- No. Just this.

51:01.920 --> 51:06.448
Okay, I just have
to get the perfect place.

51:08.026 --> 51:09.323
Yes.

51:09.494 --> 51:11.724
Your friend will be with you shortly.

51:11.896 --> 51:15.161
Thank you. Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.

51:15.333 --> 51:18.962
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat,
but then he falls off the boat.

51:19.137 --> 51:21.105
You forgot to say "spoiler alert. "

51:21.272 --> 51:26.710
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.

51:27.645 --> 51:30.443
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.

51:32.016 --> 51:33.813
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.

51:33.985 --> 51:36.453
No. I'm getting up here,
but this is not complicité.

51:36.621 --> 51:39.522
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?

51:39.691 --> 51:41.056
More the divorce, to be honest.

51:42.427 --> 51:43.451
Susan, my buttons.

51:44.829 --> 51:46.387
How much have you had to drink?

51:47.832 --> 51:51.563
- Glasses? Bottles. Okay.
- Ha, ha.

51:51.736 --> 51:54.330
We are now in an area of my expertise.

51:54.506 --> 51:57.907
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.

51:58.076 --> 52:01.443
- Close that. That's good. Good. Don't...
- Oh, that's... That's nice.

52:01.613 --> 52:03.547
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.

52:04.916 --> 52:05.940
Shh. Shut up.

52:07.318 --> 52:11.721
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat. Stop that.

52:11.890 --> 52:13.721
I'm a bad kitty.

52:13.892 --> 52:16.360
You're not a bad kitty,
you're a sleepy lunatic.

52:16.528 --> 52:20.760
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.

52:20.932 --> 52:23.332
There are no circumstances under which
I'd do that to a cat.

52:24.702 --> 52:27.102
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that. Stop it. Get... Ow!

52:28.473 --> 52:30.600
No! Unh. Ow!

52:34.846 --> 52:36.939
So this must be a fun job.

52:37.515 --> 52:39.642
Yes, it has its moments.

52:39.851 --> 52:43.685
Like trying to protect Arthur
from people with dubious intentions.

52:43.855 --> 52:44.981
NAOMl:
Hmm.

52:47.959 --> 52:50.427
Oh, you mean me.

52:50.595 --> 52:53.758
Because I'm totally after the money,
if that's what you're thinking.

52:53.932 --> 52:56.799
How is the illegal
tour guide business going?

52:57.302 --> 52:58.894
Feeds my dad.

52:59.571 --> 53:02.404
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.

53:03.174 --> 53:04.573
It was Arthur's idea.

53:04.742 --> 53:08.701
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures,
otherwise he won't understand it.

53:08.880 --> 53:11.781
I think Arthur understands
more than you realize.

53:18.487 --> 53:22.321
So, Hobson, are there any men
in your life?

53:22.691 --> 53:25.182
Are you attempting
to make small talk with me?

53:25.394 --> 53:27.954
I am attempting it. Is it working?

53:28.764 --> 53:31.494
- No, not really.
- Darn it.

53:32.334 --> 53:33.426
So?

53:34.904 --> 53:36.371
Any man I've ever met...

53:36.539 --> 53:42.444
...pales in comparison to the dazzling
floor show that is Arthur's company.

53:45.714 --> 53:48.444
I know you were being sarcastic
just then...

53:49.218 --> 53:52.415
...but it really is quite dazzling.

53:52.588 --> 53:55.955
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?

53:56.125 --> 53:58.252
Do you think he's okay?

53:58.427 --> 53:59.451
Ow! Ow!

53:59.628 --> 54:02.620
- Bad horse.
- Ow! That's not erotic. It just hurts.

54:02.798 --> 54:04.732
No. Susan. Stop it.
You can't do that.

54:04.900 --> 54:07.596
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.

54:13.442 --> 54:17.071
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.

54:21.050 --> 54:22.381
Arthur.

54:22.551 --> 54:23.984
- What's happening?
- Oh.

54:24.153 --> 54:25.552
What has happened to me?

54:25.721 --> 54:28.588
I think the problem is your clothes
are made of metal...

54:28.757 --> 54:31.385
...and my bed is made of magnets.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.120
- Oh, you think so?
- Right. Okay. Uh, stay calm, kitty.

54:34.296 --> 54:36.321
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.

54:36.499 --> 54:38.524
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.

54:38.701 --> 54:41.693
- Uh... Ah, right. I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!

54:41.871 --> 54:43.805
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna... Ah, got it.

54:43.973 --> 54:46.567
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.

54:46.742 --> 54:50.200
Uh, on the bright side, at least something
in this room is attracted to you.

54:50.379 --> 54:51.676
For the love of God.

54:51.847 --> 54:53.007
Maybe this.

54:54.583 --> 54:57.143
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.

54:57.319 --> 54:58.946
I'm not gonna press this anymore...

54:59.121 --> 55:02.887
...because if I press the wrong button,
the bed could fall and kill you.

55:03.058 --> 55:05.322
Which none of us would want.
None of us.

55:05.828 --> 55:07.955
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.

55:08.130 --> 55:12.726
Oh, you are a useless man. You can't do
anything without that miserable old woman.

55:16.805 --> 55:18.033
There you are.

55:18.674 --> 55:20.403
That was a lot of primping.

55:20.576 --> 55:23.136
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping. Yeah, primping.

55:23.312 --> 55:25.872
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though,
isn't it? The results.

55:26.048 --> 55:27.538
He's a primpanzee.

55:27.716 --> 55:31.846
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um... It's the bloody neighbors.

55:32.021 --> 55:34.455
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.

55:34.623 --> 55:35.920
Good night, Hobson.

55:36.091 --> 55:39.618
Ahem. Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.

55:39.795 --> 55:40.853
I did it for her.

55:41.030 --> 55:42.554
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.

55:42.731 --> 55:47.259
- You like her, don't you? She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.

55:47.436 --> 55:49.233
Okay.

55:50.372 --> 55:55.833
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked
businesswoman from under my bed?

55:56.111 --> 55:57.806
Sorry.

55:59.315 --> 56:00.475
Good night, Hobson.

56:00.649 --> 56:02.412
Goodbye, Naomi.

56:06.188 --> 56:07.678
NAOMl:
Not a bad back yard.

56:07.856 --> 56:10.950
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude,
I get the strangest looks.

56:11.126 --> 56:12.423
Oh, you're that guy.

56:12.595 --> 56:15.029
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.

56:15.197 --> 56:18.064
- Would you like?
- Thank you.

56:18.233 --> 56:20.064
Ahem, here.

56:20.436 --> 56:23.371
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach. "
It is.

56:23.572 --> 56:27.838
Well, it was. I had some of his suits
re-tailored to fit me.

56:28.010 --> 56:30.535
It seemed silly to throw them away.

56:32.014 --> 56:34.346
Mm.
- Oh.

56:34.516 --> 56:36.313
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"

56:36.485 --> 56:39.045
Ha, ha. Yeah. Just have fun.

56:39.221 --> 56:41.348
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.

56:42.725 --> 56:45.353
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.

56:45.527 --> 56:47.495
- Come with me. Come on.
- Okay.

56:48.664 --> 56:53.499
In my mind, this is the pond
from a book I had when I was a kid...

56:53.669 --> 56:55.500
...called Frog and Toad Together.

56:55.671 --> 56:58.834
I love Frog and Toad. My mom used to
read them to me all the time.

56:59.008 --> 57:00.134
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:00.309 --> 57:02.641
My mom subcontracted
that job to Hobson.

57:02.811 --> 57:08.249
NAOMl: There's a really sad one
where Toad freaks out...

57:08.417 --> 57:11.978
...because he sees Frog sitting alone
on a rock.

57:12.154 --> 57:16.488
So he swims out to him with a picnic,
but then it falls in the water.

57:16.659 --> 57:18.149
"Our lunch is spoiled.

57:18.327 --> 57:20.887
I made it for you, Frog,
so you'd be happy. "

57:21.063 --> 57:23.054
But Frog wasn't sad.

57:23.899 --> 57:25.730
"When I woke up, I felt good...

57:25.901 --> 57:29.359
...because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog. "

57:30.572 --> 57:33.735
And I felt good
because I have you for a friend.

57:36.278 --> 57:39.179
If you were sitting alone,
I'd bring you a sandwich.

57:40.716 --> 57:42.707
I'll sit alone, then.

57:59.935 --> 58:03.803
"And Frog and Toad
stayed on the island all afternoon.

58:03.972 --> 58:07.965
They ate wet sandwiches
without iced tea.

58:08.877 --> 58:13.041
They were two close friends
sitting alone together. "

58:16.618 --> 58:18.677
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.

58:18.887 --> 58:20.582
She's my Toad.

58:20.756 --> 58:22.621
Oh, bollocks.

58:23.992 --> 58:27.655
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi
is a very nice girl...

58:27.830 --> 58:30.128
...but you can't live
without the money.

58:30.899 --> 58:32.366
How do you know?

58:32.534 --> 58:36.197
Please. You can't go half an hour
without buying another sports car.

58:37.773 --> 58:39.764
When I was little you used to say:

58:39.942 --> 58:42.672
"Arthur,
you can do anything under the sun. "

58:42.845 --> 58:44.142
I never spoke like that.

58:44.313 --> 58:45.439
It was a bit like that.

58:45.614 --> 58:47.980
That was before
you paid Elton John $2 million...

58:48.150 --> 58:50.380
...to sing over the PA in a grocery store.

58:50.986 --> 58:52.715
Yeah, well, it was Easter.

58:53.522 --> 58:57.117
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes? How?

58:58.360 --> 58:59.452
I'd get a job.

58:59.628 --> 59:01.596
- Ha!
- What?

59:02.798 --> 59:07.132
Fine. Fine. Go ahead. Get a job.

59:08.103 --> 59:09.627
I am a grown man...

59:09.805 --> 59:14.105
...and I shall join the mature world
of gainful employment to prove it.

59:17.446 --> 59:20.415
Don't let that undermine
what I just said.

59:32.127 --> 59:34.595
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.

59:34.763 --> 59:36.788
- PowerPoint?
- No.

59:37.833 --> 59:40.301
- Outlook.
- Generally positive. You know, I mean...

59:40.469 --> 59:43.199
...I have down days like anyone, but...
It's a program.

59:43.372 --> 59:45.203
Oh, um, no.

59:46.241 --> 59:47.265
Can you file?

59:47.442 --> 59:48.466
- File?
Yes.

59:48.644 --> 59:50.111
In a?

59:51.213 --> 59:52.237
No.

59:53.816 --> 59:55.716
There must be something I can do.

59:58.821 --> 59:59.845
Hey!

01:00:00.022 --> 01:00:02.115
And so, this is how you simply sign on...

01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:03.849
...and that unlocks the register.

01:00:04.026 --> 01:00:08.827
Now, you clock in, employee number,
password and the register's yours.

01:00:09.565 --> 01:00:11.726
This, uh, might seem a bit much
for my first day...

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.801
...but could I inquire as to the possibility
of a transfer...

01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:16.801
...to the costume-greeter department?

01:00:16.972 --> 01:00:18.030
I think I'd thrive.

01:00:18.207 --> 01:00:20.835
No. Let's just start
with the register for you.

01:00:21.043 --> 01:00:22.908
I've got my own costume, if that helps.

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:25.069
Nope, doesn't really make
a difference. No.

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:26.544
Register. So I've cleared it.

01:00:26.715 --> 01:00:29.081
Go ahead and enter your
employee number and log in.

01:00:30.452 --> 01:00:33.819
- Okay. You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.

01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:37.590
- It says "invalid key. "
- Yes. Invalid key.

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:39.488
That means that I need to reset this.

01:00:39.661 --> 01:00:42.687
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over?

01:00:42.865 --> 01:00:46.528
How did he get that job, exactly? What
is he, the owner? The son of the owner?

01:00:46.702 --> 01:00:49.899
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?

01:00:50.072 --> 01:00:51.096
That's harsh.

01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:53.605
I've entered
your employee number and... Oh.

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:55.174
Want some?

01:00:55.444 --> 01:00:58.413
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?

01:00:58.981 --> 01:01:01.040
Tomorrow we'll find
something more suitable for you.

01:01:01.216 --> 01:01:03.707
I think what he's doing is derivative.

01:01:11.026 --> 01:01:13.051
Oh, the moon really is following me.

01:01:13.228 --> 01:01:16.129
Would you stop going on about the moon
following you?

01:01:17.532 --> 01:01:18.624
He's lunar.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.824
He's clearly a pervert.

01:01:32.347 --> 01:01:35.783
Arthur? There've been some reports
of staff members eating on the floor.

01:01:35.951 --> 01:01:37.213
Do you know anything about that?

01:01:37.386 --> 01:01:38.876
Um, no.

01:01:39.054 --> 01:01:41.284
No, I don't know anything
about that, Peter.

01:01:41.456 --> 01:01:44.152
You know, I think it's not appropriate
for you to be on the floor.

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:46.886
We should find something
for you in the stock room.

01:01:50.632 --> 01:01:51.656
Excuse me.

01:01:52.935 --> 01:01:56.268
If I gave you $10,000...

01:01:56.438 --> 01:01:59.669
...would you let me wear this costume
for one hour?

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:05.939
Hello. Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.

01:02:06.114 --> 01:02:07.979
Free candy! Here you go, kids!

01:02:09.451 --> 01:02:11.316
I'm a lovely bear. Grr.

01:02:12.688 --> 01:02:15.179
Sorry. Sorry. I'm not a genuine bear.

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:17.825
Here, listen, you take this with you.

01:02:17.993 --> 01:02:22.123
If you leave very quickly, security won't
have an opportunity to ascertain you.

01:02:22.297 --> 01:02:24.197
- Go. Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:25.628
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:27.598
Peter, I can explain everything.

01:02:29.438 --> 01:02:31.531
I've got one. I'm okay.

01:02:34.643 --> 01:02:35.667
Arthur.

01:02:37.179 --> 01:02:40.512
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?

01:02:41.917 --> 01:02:45.250
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.

01:02:45.721 --> 01:02:47.621
Congratulations, Arthur.

01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:53.026
The employment market is a vortex.

01:02:53.195 --> 01:02:58.497
Listen to this: "Aquarium needs help
cleaning tanks. Swim with the fishes. "

01:02:58.700 --> 01:02:59.997
That is a Mob threat.

01:03:00.202 --> 01:03:02.534
None of these jobs make any sense at all.

01:03:02.704 --> 01:03:05.502
"Systems integration professional. "

01:03:05.707 --> 01:03:07.334
Would anyone do it as an amateur?

01:03:07.509 --> 01:03:09.500
Would anyone approach
systems integration...

01:03:09.678 --> 01:03:12.943
...as a hobby for fun on a Saturday
afternoon instead of flying a kite?

01:03:13.115 --> 01:03:16.573
Who is integrating systems
for their own amusement?

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:18.977
Hobson.

01:03:20.155 --> 01:03:23.591
I think in order to do this...

01:03:23.759 --> 01:03:26.489
...I may have to be a little more sober.

01:03:31.466 --> 01:03:32.933
What do you think?

01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:36.036
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.

01:03:37.005 --> 01:03:39.337
You're right,
it would be a shame to jeopardize...

01:03:39.508 --> 01:03:42.102
...such a distinguished public profile.

01:03:50.185 --> 01:03:53.052
I stole from my friends, my family.

01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:56.386
I sold my son's tricycle
so I could score some junk.

01:03:57.059 --> 01:03:58.959
- Jesus.
I was so drunk once...

01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:01.994
...I backed my car
over my mother outside Walgreens.

01:04:02.164 --> 01:04:03.222
Thirty-seven days sober.

01:04:04.599 --> 01:04:07.295
But sometimes, it's just so hard.

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:09.027
Like I'm in this grave...

01:04:09.204 --> 01:04:13.072
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.

01:04:13.241 --> 01:04:14.936
- Shh.
- It is. I don't like it in here.

01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:16.634
This is making me want to drink more.

01:04:16.812 --> 01:04:20.304
Sir, you need to wait till the end
of the meeting. Go on, James.

01:04:20.715 --> 01:04:22.046
It's okay. I'm done.

01:04:23.418 --> 01:04:24.612
And you are?

01:04:26.154 --> 01:04:28.884
My name is...

01:04:29.091 --> 01:04:30.820
...Gandalf.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:32.789
Hi, Gandalf.

01:04:33.228 --> 01:04:34.991
Hello.

01:04:35.397 --> 01:04:40.733
And I came here because I'd like to drink
a bit less. Not give it up altogether.

01:04:40.902 --> 01:04:43.530
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.

01:04:43.705 --> 01:04:48.836
Look, I'm sorry. No one's gonna convince
me that my life isn't fun, okay?

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:51.478
And forgive my crassness...

01:04:51.646 --> 01:04:55.742
...but if I ran my mother over,
I'd be out celebrating with booze.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:05:00.052
Which is what I plan to do right now.

01:05:00.222 --> 01:05:01.655
Cheerio.

01:05:01.823 --> 01:05:04.189
Excuse me. Hobson.

01:05:06.128 --> 01:05:08.596
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.

01:05:08.763 --> 01:05:10.060
Hi, Lillian.

01:05:10.232 --> 01:05:11.699
Good afternoon.

01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:14.301
I'm rich. I'm fabulously rich.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:17.698
I'm also generous and kindhearted.

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:23.109
My father died when I was young and
my mother was absent most of the time.

01:05:23.278 --> 01:05:27.078
Is this an excuse for making a mockery
of my life?

01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:30.112
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild
from the outside.

01:05:30.285 --> 01:05:34.312
Do you know, I once went to bed with three
European princesses at the same time.

01:05:34.489 --> 01:05:36.320
But, A, I can't remember anything
about it...

01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:38.425
...and, B, apparently,
I vomited on two of them...

01:05:38.593 --> 01:05:40.959
...before losing control of my bladder
on the third.

01:05:41.129 --> 01:05:43.654
Oh, yes, all such fun.

01:05:43.832 --> 01:05:47.097
Until the fog parts,
and suddenly there's a hole so big...

01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:52.571
...that all the vintage champagne
and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.

01:05:52.741 --> 01:05:56.905
And then? Well, then,
I'm all alone on my magnetic bed...

01:05:57.078 --> 01:06:00.912
...wondering what venereal disease
I've just caught.

01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:10.417
Always the quiet ones.

01:06:15.163 --> 01:06:17.461
This is itchy.

01:06:27.542 --> 01:06:31.444
That was really lovely what you said
in there about me.

01:06:32.847 --> 01:06:37.841
Now, if you could just do the drinking for
me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.

01:06:54.369 --> 01:06:56.997
Vivienne.
Yes?

01:06:58.139 --> 01:07:00.300
Don't make me do this, please.

01:07:01.843 --> 01:07:03.743
I'm not the one with a choice.

01:07:03.945 --> 01:07:05.970
You can walk away any time you like.

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:08.741
There's a simple solution
to all of this, Arthur.

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:11.612
Marry Susan
and cheat with the nobody from Queens.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:43.980
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?

01:07:44.152 --> 01:07:46.780
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.

01:07:46.955 --> 01:07:50.186
It's a little late, but I wasn't
sleeping myself. Come in, come in.

01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:51.450
Arthur?

01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:54.291
Oh, hello, Naomi.

01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:00.099
You may wanna sit down.

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:04.262
Or lay down.

01:08:04.439 --> 01:08:07.033
Although I prefer you stayed awake,
because this is important.

01:08:07.409 --> 01:08:08.501
What is it?

01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:11.308
I'm engaged to another Susan.

01:08:11.513 --> 01:08:13.947
Woman. Another Susan woman.

01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:17.015
You're engaged?

01:08:17.185 --> 01:08:20.814
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.

01:08:21.022 --> 01:08:23.889
You meant to tell me that you were
engaged to another woman.

01:08:24.059 --> 01:08:28.496
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God. Arthur.

01:08:28.662 --> 01:08:30.187
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.

01:08:30.965 --> 01:08:33.263
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.

01:08:33.435 --> 01:08:35.335
Why else would you be wearing
her pajamas.

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:39.173
I didn't mean for this to happen,
but then I started falling for you.

01:08:39.341 --> 01:08:41.639
And I thought,
"Oh, no. I'm falling for Naomi...

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:44.643
...and I have to marry Susan woman
or I'll lose the money. "

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:48.180
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.

01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:51.113
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to...

01:08:51.286 --> 01:08:53.515
...because you're scared
of losing the money?

01:08:53.688 --> 01:08:57.818
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.

01:08:57.992 --> 01:09:01.120
Oh, okay. Well, we should probably
start a telethon.

01:09:01.296 --> 01:09:04.560
And then people could call in
and relieve you from this horrible money.

01:09:04.733 --> 01:09:06.598
If you think it would help.

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:09.532
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:13.064
You're the most special person...

01:09:13.241 --> 01:09:15.402
...that I have ever...
- What, lied to?

01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:17.368
I was gonna say "met. "

01:09:18.145 --> 01:09:20.774
Am I the most special person
you ever made this for?

01:09:21.582 --> 01:09:24.711
Who makes a PEZ dispenser
of somebody's head...

01:09:24.886 --> 01:09:26.751
...when they're engaged
to someone else?

01:09:26.921 --> 01:09:29.116
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:30.518
Stop joking.

01:09:30.692 --> 01:09:33.752
Okay. Let me run this up the flag pole.

01:09:33.928 --> 01:09:37.295
What if I were to install a secret door?

01:09:37.732 --> 01:09:40.724
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.

01:09:40.902 --> 01:09:43.529
On the other side of that door,
I'm married to Susan.

01:09:43.705 --> 01:09:47.640
That's not ideal. But on the bright side,
I assure you it's entirely sexless.

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:50.607
What? Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.

01:09:50.779 --> 01:09:55.011
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:02.479
This is for you.

01:10:02.757 --> 01:10:06.124
For your dad. For your writing career.

01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:12.258
Nine hundred
and ninety-nine thousand dollars.

01:10:12.434 --> 01:10:15.926
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:19.670
Could you leave?

01:10:20.909 --> 01:10:22.934
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?

01:10:23.111 --> 01:10:24.635
Why?

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:31.048
Because it will reduce the proportion of my
life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.

01:10:31.786 --> 01:10:33.879
Goodbye, Arthur.

01:10:43.798 --> 01:10:45.561
Closet.

01:10:54.976 --> 01:10:57.103
And back, two, three. Front, two, three.

01:10:57.278 --> 01:10:58.711
Back. And here we turn.

01:10:59.314 --> 01:11:01.874
This is gonna be our first dance
as husband and wife.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.416
At least you could just try to smile.

01:11:04.586 --> 01:11:06.144
Sorry.

01:11:06.321 --> 01:11:09.484
And I apologize for leaving you
attached to that magnetic bed.

01:11:09.657 --> 01:11:11.147
Oh.

01:11:11.326 --> 01:11:14.227
Someone's coming to his senses. Finally.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:16.420
Good. Now, under the arm.

01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:50.448
Hobson.

01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:52.354
Hobson!

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.920
Hobson. I've just spotted Orphan Annie
as a man.

01:12:56.564 --> 01:12:57.690
Orphan Mannie!

01:12:57.865 --> 01:13:00.561
Bitterman. What are you doing
in my bathroom? We discussed this.

01:13:00.735 --> 01:13:03.829
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed. She had a headache.

01:13:04.305 --> 01:13:06.068
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.470
How did she say it? What did she say?

01:13:08.643 --> 01:13:11.510
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache. "

01:13:11.813 --> 01:13:14.782
She sort of said it like that,
all broken up and staccato?

01:13:15.216 --> 01:13:16.615
Pretty much, sir.

01:13:16.784 --> 01:13:18.513
- Solely on their mother...

01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:21.780
...for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...

01:13:23.458 --> 01:13:26.689
- What's the matter? Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.

01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:29.352
There'll be no bears
until you tell me what's the matter.

01:13:32.133 --> 01:13:35.500
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.

01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:37.137
There's a garden at the end.

01:13:37.739 --> 01:13:41.607
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?

01:13:41.776 --> 01:13:43.471
Stop being childish.

01:13:43.878 --> 01:13:45.709
Sorry.

01:13:46.247 --> 01:13:49.182
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:57.119
Listen...

01:13:58.426 --> 01:14:00.792
...there are three books.

01:14:01.429 --> 01:14:04.364
Take them back to the library.

01:14:05.166 --> 01:14:08.465
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.

01:14:09.303 --> 01:14:12.739
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.

01:14:14.242 --> 01:14:15.573
Naomi won't talk to me.

01:14:17.979 --> 01:14:22.348
Oh, I am sorry. It's a shame she
wouldn't come to an agreement.

01:14:22.517 --> 01:14:25.577
Little tart like that would've saved you
a fortune in prostitutes.

01:14:26.154 --> 01:14:30.386
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.

01:14:30.558 --> 01:14:32.150
I employ you to support me.

01:14:32.326 --> 01:14:35.887
I don't pay you to make snide comments
about my friends. Remember that.

01:14:36.297 --> 01:14:38.424
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.

01:14:44.839 --> 01:14:48.468
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

01:14:48.643 --> 01:14:51.942
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:55.947
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.

01:14:57.218 --> 01:14:58.276
Are you, now?

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:02.654
Look, he has attempted gainful employment
and he even went to AA.

01:15:02.824 --> 01:15:06.385
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?

01:15:07.228 --> 01:15:10.425
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...

01:15:10.598 --> 01:15:15.262
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?

01:15:15.903 --> 01:15:18.599
Arthur does have other issues.

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.035
And whose fault is that?

01:15:25.213 --> 01:15:30.378
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted
your valuable time.

01:15:31.919 --> 01:15:33.819
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.

01:15:35.123 --> 01:15:37.683
He's stronger than you think.

01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:49.098
NAOMl:
Who was that?

01:15:49.637 --> 01:15:50.968
Um...

01:15:52.373 --> 01:15:54.466
Hobson is in my house.

01:15:54.642 --> 01:15:56.405
Surprisingly, I am.

01:15:56.577 --> 01:16:00.445
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.

01:16:05.086 --> 01:16:07.554
You got that, McKenzie? Thank you.

01:16:07.722 --> 01:16:10.020
Why am I stuck here in this room?

01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:12.887
I'm not the bride
I'm the bloody groom

01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:17.192
Isn't he charming?

01:16:18.566 --> 01:16:19.828
It's the sweetest thing.

01:16:20.001 --> 01:16:22.629
Oh. Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.

01:16:22.804 --> 01:16:25.637
Ooh.

01:16:25.807 --> 01:16:27.934
- No metal.
Very nice.

01:16:28.109 --> 01:16:30.407
Just don't leave me for a minute

01:16:30.578 --> 01:16:33.046
Or you'll come home and find me in it

01:16:34.415 --> 01:16:36.246
I just made that up.
That just came to me.

01:16:36.417 --> 01:16:37.748
Here.

01:16:38.386 --> 01:16:42.550
Oh. Love these. The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.

01:16:42.723 --> 01:16:45.385
Grape shears, what an innovation

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.688
You can use them for my castration

01:16:50.164 --> 01:16:54.328
Because she does that. I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.

01:16:58.272 --> 01:17:00.001
Arthur misses you desperately.

01:17:00.441 --> 01:17:03.706
Has he asked you to go on a tour
of all of the girls that he misses?

01:17:03.878 --> 01:17:07.075
No, he's far too decent to be involved
in anything as tawdry as this.

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:08.408
As what?

01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:10.881
As my plea not to give up on him.

01:17:15.289 --> 01:17:17.018
You really look after him, don't you?

01:17:17.225 --> 01:17:21.093
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.

01:17:21.495 --> 01:17:23.520
A, um, taste of England.

01:17:23.698 --> 01:17:26.667
Oh. Oh, lovely.

01:17:27.168 --> 01:17:29.932
As, I believe,
you look after this gentleman.

01:17:30.338 --> 01:17:34.536
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but Arthur is getting married.

01:17:36.043 --> 01:17:42.107
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman
can recognize it's a young man in love.

01:17:47.355 --> 01:17:48.617
How's that tea?

01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:50.550
Like sewage.

01:17:57.398 --> 01:17:59.866
- I'm so sorry.
NAOMl: Uh, are you okay?

01:18:00.034 --> 01:18:04.562
Thank you. Thanks, ladies, for such
a lovely afternoon. These are gorgeous.

01:18:04.872 --> 01:18:06.965
- Arthur, hasn't it been?
- Cheers. Thank you.

01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:09.109
Thank you, ladies. Thank you.

01:18:09.277 --> 01:18:11.837
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.

01:18:18.085 --> 01:18:19.882
Hey. Hello.

01:18:21.022 --> 01:18:22.046
What?

01:18:23.357 --> 01:18:24.949
It's just a headache.

01:18:25.126 --> 01:18:29.222
Hold on. You've been having tests for
months. The doctor told me on the phone.

01:18:29.397 --> 01:18:31.422
Oh, bother snaps.

01:18:31.599 --> 01:18:33.328
Well, what do doctors know anyway?

01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:37.301
I think they're usually really well qualified,
Hobson. Why didn't you mention this?

01:18:37.672 --> 01:18:41.733
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.

01:18:42.209 --> 01:18:43.642
Well, now I am worried.

01:18:46.781 --> 01:18:50.478
But forget the worry
and enjoy this extravagant gesture!

01:18:50.651 --> 01:18:53.677
Look at those bears. I love them.

01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:55.981
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?

01:18:56.157 --> 01:18:58.785
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:02.158
Put this on, please.

01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:03.592
I'm not putting that on.

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:06.598
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.

01:19:15.609 --> 01:19:16.871
Humiliating.

01:19:17.044 --> 01:19:19.035
- You look really dignified.
Mm.

01:19:23.317 --> 01:19:25.717
How much did you waste on this?

01:19:25.886 --> 01:19:28.116
They're very reasonable, actually.

01:19:28.289 --> 01:19:31.850
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie. "
Wash your winkie.

01:19:33.728 --> 01:19:36.322
Say, "If you have to pay them,
it's not love. "

01:19:36.497 --> 01:19:38.658
If you have to pay, it's not love.

01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:40.824
Ha! You do one, you do one.

01:19:41.002 --> 01:19:43.300
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?

01:19:43.504 --> 01:19:45.699
Sammy Davis, Jr. Is not to do
with that costume.

01:19:45.873 --> 01:19:47.932
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?

01:19:48.109 --> 01:19:50.600
I see you've decided not to grow up.

01:19:50.778 --> 01:19:53.576
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.

01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:58.577
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside. Do you wanna see her?

01:19:59.987 --> 01:20:02.080
You see her for me, will you?

01:20:08.029 --> 01:20:09.257
How is she?

01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:12.958
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything...

01:20:13.134 --> 01:20:16.160
...because we're not family.
- That's hospitals.

01:20:17.204 --> 01:20:18.501
Why was she at your house?

01:20:18.806 --> 01:20:23.209
Hobson and I hang out all the time. We go
shoplifting every Wednesday. Bergdorf's.

01:20:23.411 --> 01:20:26.244
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:28.614
She was worried about you.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.686
Hey, how's the writing going?

01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:39.181
It's really good, actually.

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.357
I sold my book.

01:20:41.529 --> 01:20:44.657
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.

01:20:44.832 --> 01:20:47.300
When you found out,
did you do a scream?

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:49.129
I did. I went:

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.267
- Only louder.
Right.

01:20:55.443 --> 01:21:00.710
Yeah. I mean, a scream is defined
by its vocal quality to some degree.

01:21:01.816 --> 01:21:04.250
I've been really angry at you.

01:21:05.152 --> 01:21:10.215
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I
was gonna say to you if I saw you again.

01:21:10.391 --> 01:21:12.791
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur. "

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.587
That's conventional.

01:21:14.762 --> 01:21:18.664
And then I was gonna
get into a lot of really mean stuff.

01:21:19.567 --> 01:21:24.561
And it was gonna be directed at you in
a very pointed way because you lied to me.

01:21:24.738 --> 01:21:28.265
But then I would run out of steam
eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:

01:21:29.043 --> 01:21:32.672
"Thank you for encouraging me
with my writing. "

01:21:33.848 --> 01:21:38.342
And then I would get very serious and I'd
look at you in the eyes and I would say:

01:21:38.886 --> 01:21:40.581
"Arthur...

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:42.283
...you have a problem. "

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:48.127
I'm glad that was hypothetical
because that would be really hard to hear.

01:21:49.597 --> 01:21:50.621
How is Hobson?

01:21:50.798 --> 01:21:53.289
Ah. Well...

01:21:54.235 --> 01:21:56.829
Naomi, this is Susan...

01:21:57.605 --> 01:21:59.732
...my fiancée.

01:21:59.907 --> 01:22:02.467
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.

01:22:02.643 --> 01:22:04.270
It's nice to finally meet you.

01:22:04.445 --> 01:22:07.471
That is like a medium-size ice rink.

01:22:07.648 --> 01:22:10.617
And ice rink. That's what I said,
but I said for mice. Because it's small.

01:22:10.784 --> 01:22:13.446
- You're a tour guide, right?
NAOMl: Yep.

01:22:13.621 --> 01:22:16.522
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.

01:22:16.690 --> 01:22:19.318
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?

01:22:19.493 --> 01:22:22.053
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.

01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:24.220
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.

01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:26.992
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...

01:22:27.168 --> 01:22:29.227
Why might that name
sound so familiar to me?

01:22:29.737 --> 01:22:32.228
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?

01:22:32.773 --> 01:22:35.537
No, Susan, I can't.

01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:37.234
Oh.

01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:40.141
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.

01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:44.346
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.

01:22:45.753 --> 01:22:47.721
But why would you buy them?

01:22:49.323 --> 01:22:52.019
So you could tell them
to publish my book.

01:22:58.365 --> 01:22:59.923
Thank you.

01:23:02.369 --> 01:23:04.667
What'd you do that for?

01:23:05.206 --> 01:23:07.504
I just did her a favor.

01:23:08.642 --> 01:23:10.269
Naomi, wait.

01:23:12.746 --> 01:23:14.373
Wait.

01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:19.575
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you
again, and I think you're talented...

01:23:19.753 --> 01:23:22.085
I thought other people
thought that I was talented.

01:23:22.256 --> 01:23:25.692
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.

01:23:25.859 --> 01:23:28.851
And that felt really good.
I like that. I like earning something.

01:23:29.029 --> 01:23:34.763
And I know that you don't know
what that feels like, but it's great.

01:23:36.237 --> 01:23:38.933
You should try it sometime.

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.039
Ow, ow, ow.

01:23:45.212 --> 01:23:48.079
I cut my hand. There's blood in those.

01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:52.242
Actually, um, don't eat them
because of the blood.

01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:03.529
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?

01:24:03.697 --> 01:24:07.224
Do you tear the top off
or you use this to cut in? How?

01:24:07.401 --> 01:24:09.494
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:12.366
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm. With water. Hot water.

01:24:12.539 --> 01:24:14.268
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.

01:24:14.441 --> 01:24:15.499
- From a?
- Kettle.

01:24:15.676 --> 01:24:17.007
Brilliant. Perfect.

01:24:22.883 --> 01:24:24.874
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...

01:24:26.253 --> 01:24:27.845
Oh, God, no!

01:24:28.022 --> 01:24:29.819
- Hot.

01:24:30.024 --> 01:24:32.515
I think I was better off in the hospital.

01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:36.257
Bon appétit.

01:24:39.667 --> 01:24:42.966
Actually, my medication
makes me sufficiently nauseous.

01:24:43.137 --> 01:24:45.332
You're forever pestering me
about change...

01:24:45.506 --> 01:24:48.964
...and you're afraid to eat a little bowl
of spaghetti circles. Come along.

01:24:52.413 --> 01:24:54.313
Please let me look after you.

01:25:07.494 --> 01:25:08.620
Quite nice.

01:25:08.796 --> 01:25:10.229
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

01:25:10.731 --> 01:25:13.564
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...

01:25:13.734 --> 01:25:15.065
- Ha.
... but it's quite nice.

01:25:15.502 --> 01:25:17.595
I'm a genius in there.

01:25:28.549 --> 01:25:31.017
Mother bear will care for her cubs...

01:25:31.185 --> 01:25:33.847
...for up to two years.

01:25:55.075 --> 01:25:56.702
Lovely.

01:25:58.045 --> 01:26:00.377
Come on, come on, come on.

01:26:00.547 --> 01:26:02.481
- No. Not like this.
- Aah! Ha-ha-ha.

01:26:02.649 --> 01:26:04.378
You've got so much to give.

01:26:22.302 --> 01:26:23.860
Have you called her, Arthur?

01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:26.169
No.

01:26:30.344 --> 01:26:32.869
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:36.506
Yes, I was once.

01:26:36.683 --> 01:26:39.914
Yes, in London. He was from Spain.

01:26:40.287 --> 01:26:42.152
He asked me to go there with him.

01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:43.914
You were nearly 3.

01:26:44.391 --> 01:26:45.756
What happened?

01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:50.425
Two days before I was due to leave...

01:26:50.597 --> 01:26:52.895
I had my bags all packed.

01:26:53.066 --> 01:26:54.260
- Your father died.

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.439
You should've gone.
I would've understood.

01:27:10.050 --> 01:27:12.177
It was too late.

01:27:12.553 --> 01:27:14.748
I loved you.

01:27:15.956 --> 01:27:17.947
Why have you never told me?

01:27:18.192 --> 01:27:20.626
I didn't want you to feel bad.

01:27:20.794 --> 01:27:24.389
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.

01:27:32.406 --> 01:27:35.466
So this is what it's like
to go to bed at 9:00.

01:27:35.642 --> 01:27:37.405
Yes.

01:27:37.611 --> 01:27:39.841
Isn't it wicked?

01:27:49.056 --> 01:27:51.251
Hmm, Hobson.

01:27:51.825 --> 01:27:53.690
I had a bad dream.

01:27:53.861 --> 01:27:55.658
Hobson?

01:27:57.164 --> 01:27:59.724
Hobson, stop mucking about.

01:27:59.967 --> 01:28:03.334
You can't see a tunnel of light
and red pitchfork.

01:28:03.504 --> 01:28:07.133
I'm not gonna take those three books
back to the library.

01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:11.875
Hobson?

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.214
Nurse!

01:28:19.386 --> 01:28:21.217
Nurse!

01:29:24.451 --> 01:29:26.248
Bitterman?

01:29:31.391 --> 01:29:33.484
We're gonna have a party.

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.924
I'm tired of being sad now.

01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:32.077
Bitterman, what are you doing?

01:30:32.252 --> 01:30:35.016
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.

01:30:35.188 --> 01:30:36.280
Is it working?

01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:38.615
Not yet.

01:30:42.796 --> 01:30:43.888
How about now?

01:30:44.631 --> 01:30:47.327
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.

01:30:47.501 --> 01:30:51.403
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.

01:30:52.039 --> 01:30:54.234
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.

01:30:54.408 --> 01:30:56.968
Well, that's it. I'm gonna drown myself.

01:30:57.444 --> 01:30:59.002
Mr. Bach?

01:30:59.179 --> 01:31:01.079
Mr. Bach? Where'd you go?

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:05.718
Lovely to see you. Hello.

01:31:06.853 --> 01:31:08.252
Chancellor.

01:31:08.422 --> 01:31:11.118
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.

01:31:11.291 --> 01:31:14.454
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly
surprised. Enjoy yourself.

01:31:14.628 --> 01:31:15.720
The groom is here.

01:31:15.896 --> 01:31:19.923
Ah. I gather the groom has arrived.

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.897
Bitterman. Bitterman.

01:31:22.536 --> 01:31:25.004
Please. I'm getting married today.

01:31:25.172 --> 01:31:27.333
But you were in there too long.

01:31:27.841 --> 01:31:30.810
- Oh, God. She's here.
- You're late. Was I not clear?

01:31:30.977 --> 01:31:33.537
Don't... Don't... Don't blame Bitterman.

01:31:33.714 --> 01:31:36.512
He had a hell of a struggle getting me
out of the bath.

01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:37.842
Coffee. Now.

01:31:38.018 --> 01:31:39.815
Good idea. I'll have one too.

01:31:39.986 --> 01:31:41.078
I'm a bit drunk.

01:31:41.254 --> 01:31:42.721
Okay.

01:31:42.889 --> 01:31:45.187
The good news is you're here
and you're not wearing a cape.

01:31:45.358 --> 01:31:47.349
Proud day for you, Viv?

01:31:48.995 --> 01:31:51.623
I have guests to attend to. Stay.

01:32:28.735 --> 01:32:30.202
Psst.

01:32:30.570 --> 01:32:32.538
Small person.

01:32:33.206 --> 01:32:34.571
Can you read?

01:32:35.442 --> 01:32:37.501
For, like, four years. Can you?

01:32:37.811 --> 01:32:39.745
Not at the moment, no.

01:32:39.913 --> 01:32:40.937
Help. Come here.

01:32:50.457 --> 01:32:52.357
I need you to read this for me.

01:32:52.926 --> 01:32:54.518
Okay.

01:32:59.065 --> 01:33:04.469
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick. "

01:33:04.638 --> 01:33:06.401
Carry on.

01:33:06.573 --> 01:33:08.666
"You now know where the tea bags are.

01:33:08.842 --> 01:33:11.436
To operate kettle, press red button.

01:33:11.711 --> 01:33:13.235
Milk in refrigerator.

01:33:13.413 --> 01:33:17.008
That's the big box with the pretty light
that comes on when you open the door.

01:33:17.717 --> 01:33:21.881
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.

01:33:22.055 --> 01:33:24.683
All my deepest, fondest love.

01:33:24.858 --> 01:33:26.849
I'm smiling down at you.

01:33:27.027 --> 01:33:30.019
Or, more likely, up at you.

01:33:30.597 --> 01:33:34.158
Forever and ever, H."

01:33:39.606 --> 01:33:40.834
Are you crying?

01:33:42.342 --> 01:33:45.334
That's a bride's job, to cry.

01:33:45.512 --> 01:33:47.241
It's time to man up, Arthur.

01:34:28.622 --> 01:34:29.680
Dearly beloved...

01:34:30.557 --> 01:34:35.585
...we are gathered here today
to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.

01:34:36.563 --> 01:34:40.465
Which is commended
to be honorable among all men.

01:34:40.634 --> 01:34:46.834
And therefore, is not by any to be entered
into unadvisedly or lightly...

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:50.840
...but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.

01:34:51.011 --> 01:34:54.139
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?

01:34:54.314 --> 01:34:55.645
Shh, Arthur.

01:34:55.815 --> 01:34:59.148
If any person can show just cause...

01:34:59.452 --> 01:35:02.649
...why they may not
be joined together...

01:35:02.822 --> 01:35:06.758
...let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

01:35:13.166 --> 01:35:14.292
I object!

01:35:15.902 --> 01:35:19.736
To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object. It's your wedding.

01:35:19.906 --> 01:35:24.400
Is it my wedding? Because I think if it was,
I'd know who all these people were.

01:35:24.577 --> 01:35:25.976
I mean, who are you?

01:35:26.279 --> 01:35:28.474
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...

01:35:28.648 --> 01:35:32.106
- Actually, have I? I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.

01:35:32.285 --> 01:35:34.253
Oh, yeah, right. It's nice to see you.

01:35:34.421 --> 01:35:37.117
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?

01:35:37.290 --> 01:35:39.815
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.

01:35:39.993 --> 01:35:43.656
If there was, then I don't think
I'd have enjoyed it. You look like squares.

01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:45.798
And I've slept with three of them.

01:35:46.099 --> 01:35:48.260
Not sure which three.
I just... Statistically...

01:35:48.435 --> 01:35:50.767
Susan, this isn't real.

01:35:50.937 --> 01:35:54.270
This wedding is a sham. It's a
wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.

01:35:54.441 --> 01:35:56.033
We don't love each other.

01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:58.769
Even you deserve better than this.

01:36:02.716 --> 01:36:05.810
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln
who said, "Freedom... "

01:36:07.687 --> 01:36:08.711
That's my little girl.

01:36:12.292 --> 01:36:15.227
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan. Abercrombie. Fitch.

01:36:15.395 --> 01:36:20.731
I am the future of this company,
and all I need is your goddamn last name.

01:36:22.802 --> 01:36:24.326
- Hit him in the face.
- No.

01:36:24.504 --> 01:36:26.472
Stop.

01:36:26.639 --> 01:36:28.573
Don't touch my son.

01:36:31.378 --> 01:36:33.312
But Vivienne.

01:36:33.546 --> 01:36:35.741
I think you've said enough.

01:36:36.116 --> 01:36:37.140
Arthur, come here.

01:36:47.694 --> 01:36:49.321
Are you certain about this?

01:36:50.063 --> 01:36:51.758
Yes, I am.

01:36:52.165 --> 01:36:53.689
It means giving up everything.

01:36:54.968 --> 01:36:57.528
I'm happy to give up everything.

01:36:58.071 --> 01:37:02.371
In fact, Vivienne, I can start
giving up everything right now.

01:37:02.542 --> 01:37:05.705
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.

01:37:05.879 --> 01:37:08.370
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.

01:37:08.548 --> 01:37:11.949
I feel like I'm bound up
like a little Japanese girl's foot.

01:37:12.118 --> 01:37:15.918
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.

01:37:16.089 --> 01:37:17.454
Bloody thing. Ugh.

01:37:18.158 --> 01:37:20.388
This shirt, itchy.

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:22.084
I don't want it anymore.

01:37:22.262 --> 01:37:25.288
I can assure all of you that after this...

01:37:25.465 --> 01:37:28.696
...I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.

01:37:28.868 --> 01:37:32.065
So your investments are on solid footing.

01:37:34.641 --> 01:37:38.202
Excuse me. Don't let that detract
from what I just said.

01:37:38.378 --> 01:37:39.606
And finally...

01:37:41.748 --> 01:37:46.014
Actually, um, these were
a Christmas present from Hobson. I...

01:37:46.219 --> 01:37:47.777
I think I'll hang onto them.

01:37:47.954 --> 01:37:51.151
- I'm keeping this ring. I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.

01:37:51.324 --> 01:37:54.555
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.

01:38:01.768 --> 01:38:02.894
So how'd it go?

01:38:03.369 --> 01:38:08.136
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman,
but I'm afraid you're out of a job.

01:38:10.143 --> 01:38:11.167
Congratulations.

01:38:12.178 --> 01:38:15.375
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet...

01:38:15.548 --> 01:38:18.210
...but I've gotta get used to fending
for myself now.

01:38:18.384 --> 01:38:20.784
Could you hail me a cab, please?

01:38:23.356 --> 01:38:25.290
Arthur.

01:38:29.829 --> 01:38:32.161
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.

01:38:32.332 --> 01:38:36.291
But this time, I respect you for it.

01:38:36.469 --> 01:38:38.130
You're stronger than I thought.

01:38:38.338 --> 01:38:40.499
And you've shown me the truth
about Susan.

01:38:40.673 --> 01:38:42.368
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?

01:38:42.542 --> 01:38:44.032
Oh.

01:38:45.078 --> 01:38:47.308
- For the cab.
- Oh.

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:49.277
Good luck in your life, Arthur.

01:38:51.818 --> 01:38:53.342
A bit awkward.

01:38:54.721 --> 01:38:56.052
We've got to get to Queens.

01:38:56.222 --> 01:38:57.849
Do you know Queens?

01:38:58.024 --> 01:39:00.720
It's full of traffic, isn't it?

01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:05.327
Do you know Naomi?

01:39:05.498 --> 01:39:07.159
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.

01:39:07.333 --> 01:39:08.891
Naomi!

01:39:09.068 --> 01:39:10.160
What?

01:39:11.538 --> 01:39:16.601
Hello. I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.

01:39:16.809 --> 01:39:18.174
I came in a taxi.

01:39:18.745 --> 01:39:21.236
- You're wasted, Arthur.
No!

01:39:21.414 --> 01:39:24.906
Well, yes. But that was only
so I could get married.

01:39:25.084 --> 01:39:29.851
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi! I didn't go through with it.

01:39:30.023 --> 01:39:35.325
Instead, I did the only rational thing,
and I gave away all of my clothes.

01:39:35.495 --> 01:39:39.226
Do you remember one word
of the last conversation we had, Arthur?

01:39:39.399 --> 01:39:44.928
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No. The other conversation.

01:39:45.205 --> 01:39:48.504
I gave away billions of money for you.

01:39:48.942 --> 01:39:51.410
You shouldn't have done that.

01:39:53.046 --> 01:39:54.673
Naomi?

01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:59.980
My mum's dead.

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.547
I know.

01:40:03.423 --> 01:40:07.621
And I am so... I'm so, so sorry.

01:40:07.794 --> 01:40:09.227
But...

01:40:09.996 --> 01:40:12.590
...I can't be her replacement.

01:40:14.234 --> 01:40:15.792
Okay.

01:40:53.039 --> 01:40:54.631
I used to have in my apartment...

01:40:54.807 --> 01:40:59.210
...a rather large,
incredibly decadent magnetic bed.

01:40:59.412 --> 01:41:01.812
Thought "This bed is gonna
make me truly happy. "

01:41:01.981 --> 01:41:05.610
This is the one thing that my life requires,
is a floating magnetic bed.

01:41:05.785 --> 01:41:10.347
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...

01:41:10.523 --> 01:41:14.550
What's a euphemistic way to say it
that doesn't sound unpleasant? Um...

01:41:14.727 --> 01:41:15.751
A prostitute. And...

01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:19.428
We tried to prize open the door
of the fish tank...

01:41:19.599 --> 01:41:21.658
...because we thought
we could make a phone call.

01:41:21.834 --> 01:41:24.598
Broke the door off of the fish tank.

01:41:24.771 --> 01:41:26.898
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.

01:41:28.541 --> 01:41:32.671
It wasn't without its amusing moments,
but it took a spiritual toll on me...

01:41:32.845 --> 01:41:37.748
...and none of these phone boxes, nor
magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.

01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:41.943
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing
my family and people that care about me.

01:41:42.121 --> 01:41:45.989
But I've made amends with my mother
now. As much as you can with a dragon.

01:41:46.159 --> 01:41:48.024
I'm six months clean today.

01:41:49.829 --> 01:41:51.820
Congratulations.

01:41:52.065 --> 01:41:54.590
I think this is the most
I've ever valued a coin.

01:42:15.988 --> 01:42:17.580
Next.

01:42:17.757 --> 01:42:19.418
Next in line, please.

01:42:23.062 --> 01:42:25.053
That's 12.50.

01:42:37.210 --> 01:42:40.475
NAOMl: Lady Liberty wrapped
her giant green arms...

01:42:40.646 --> 01:42:42.944
...around the Chrysler Building
one last time.

01:42:43.116 --> 01:42:46.711
And then she carefully walked
back to her own island.

01:42:46.886 --> 01:42:49.013
Even though they'll
always live apart...

01:42:49.188 --> 01:42:53.090
...they'll still stand a little taller
and shine a little brighter...

01:42:53.626 --> 01:42:55.890
...because they shared an adventure.

01:42:56.396 --> 01:42:57.420
The end.

01:43:00.199 --> 01:43:03.032
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?

01:43:03.202 --> 01:43:04.260
I have a question.

01:43:06.239 --> 01:43:10.972
Does anybody mind
if I tell another story?

01:43:11.144 --> 01:43:12.304
- I mind.
- Me too.

01:43:12.745 --> 01:43:14.645
You sound like Harry Potter.

01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:17.612
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.

01:43:17.784 --> 01:43:21.447
Listen, it's quite a good story,
and if no one here minds...

01:43:21.621 --> 01:43:22.645
Uh, excuse me, sorry.

01:43:22.822 --> 01:43:26.883
- I'd really like the opportunity
to tell it.

01:43:27.059 --> 01:43:29.527
If that's okay, um...

01:43:30.062 --> 01:43:34.590
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.

01:43:34.934 --> 01:43:37.266
He fell in love with a princess
from Queens.

01:43:37.437 --> 01:43:39.667
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.

01:43:40.273 --> 01:43:43.470
The fact is,
he loved this princess so much...

01:43:43.643 --> 01:43:46.407
...that he was prepared
to give up his kingdom for her...

01:43:46.579 --> 01:43:48.672
...but she turned him away.

01:43:48.881 --> 01:43:51.748
- What a bitch.
- She was not. Why would you say that?

01:43:51.918 --> 01:43:53.783
She did the right thing,
it turns out...

01:43:53.953 --> 01:43:59.186
...because this prince
had a little bit of a problem with...

01:44:00.159 --> 01:44:03.822
...candy. He couldn't get enough candy.

01:44:03.996 --> 01:44:06.328
- Do you mean drugs?
No. No. Where did you grow up?

01:44:06.499 --> 01:44:07.659
Meth?
- No.

01:44:07.834 --> 01:44:09.597
Crack?
- No. It was just booze.

01:44:09.769 --> 01:44:12.636
Look, this isn't working. Okay.

01:44:16.209 --> 01:44:21.670
What I came here to say to you,
Naomi, is that I'm sorry.

01:44:22.148 --> 01:44:24.309
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

01:44:24.484 --> 01:44:26.884
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

01:44:27.053 --> 01:44:29.851
And I'm sorry
that I asked you to take care of me...

01:44:30.022 --> 01:44:35.153
...when what I want more than anything
in the world is to take care of you.

01:44:39.999 --> 01:44:42.968
And I think that's the end of the story.

01:44:59.285 --> 01:45:01.310
Ew!

01:45:02.755 --> 01:45:04.052
Hey, what's wrong with you?

01:45:04.223 --> 01:45:08.250
This is just two adults
kissing in a room full of children.

01:45:12.031 --> 01:45:13.760
So how's the real world treating you?

01:45:13.933 --> 01:45:17.096
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should
just try and live simply now.

01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:19.204
- It's better for me.
- What is this?

01:45:19.372 --> 01:45:20.896
Bitterman! Why?

01:45:21.073 --> 01:45:25.373
You said, "This is the girl I can buy
back with a fleet of movie cars. "

01:45:25.545 --> 01:45:30.141
I said this is a girl I can't buy back
with a fleet of movie cars.

01:45:30.316 --> 01:45:32.580
