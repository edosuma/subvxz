It's her first day.

00:03.962 --> 00:05.964
Welcome to Theranos.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.549
- Here, put it on the camera
on your computer.

00:07.549 --> 00:08.634
Why?

00:08.634 --> 00:10.010
So they can't watch you.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.931
- If Ian had testified, it would have
invalidated Theranos' patents.

00:13.931 --> 00:16.642
- For a story like this, I really need
someone with firsthand knowledge.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.602
<i>They must be running
everything on the Siemens machines</i>

00:18.602 --> 00:19.645
<i>to get around the regulators.</i>

00:19.645 --> 00:20.979
- Do you really think
she'd let that happen?

00:20.979 --> 00:23.482
- Dude, she is the CEO.
She knows what's going on.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.359
- Are you running
the Edison proficiency tests

00:25.359 --> 00:26.360
on Siemens machines?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.654
- You have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:28.654 --> 00:32.406
- You believe Theranos
is lying to regulators?

00:32.406 --> 00:34.618
- Yeah, that's why we need you
to start asking questions.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.203
No, I won't.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.663
I'm ready for your questions now.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.971
Tell them how old you were.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.639
-I was 19.

how in God's name at 19

02:18.597 --> 02:22.643
was she able to convince some
of the leading professors in America,

I'm going to start a company."

02:59.680 --> 03:01.974
- So the Theranos report
for the patient came back

03:01.974 --> 03:04.142
showing an abnormally high TSH value.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.312
- But the patient was already taking
thyroid medication

03:07.312 --> 03:09.356
- to lower that value?
- Precisely.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.860
And the Theranos results indicated
the medication wasn't working.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.361
Was Theranos correct?

03:14.903 --> 03:17.155
This patient was pregnant, okay.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.868
Increasing her dosage would have made
her thyroid hormone levels so high,

03:20.868 --> 03:22.828
it would have put her pregnancy at risk.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.164
Would you go on the record with this?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.834
- Abso-fucking-lutely.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.589
- I tracked down a patient
who spent Thanksgiving in the ER

03:33.589 --> 03:36.133
because a Theranos test
told her incorrectly

03:36.133 --> 03:37.676
- she was having a stroke.
- Mm.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.428
Thousands of dollars in medical bills.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.305
I spoke with a cancer survivor,

03:41.305 --> 03:43.557

03:43.557 --> 03:44.600
Jesus.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.352
I have three doctors on the record.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.854
I have the Mark Roessler emails.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.773
No, not yet, but he should shortly.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.233
From what he describes,
they're pretty damning.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.485
I've got Gardner and Gibbons on the record

03:55.485 --> 03:57.613

03:57.613 --> 03:59.781
Wait, wait, uh, back up. Tyler who?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.533
- This kid worked in the labs
with Erika Cheung.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.577
He's George Schultz's grandson.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.620
Huh.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.997
Does Schultz know his grandson
is talking to us?

04:06.997 --> 04:09.208
- Oh no. And I have to make sure
he doesn't.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.626
Yeah, no shit.

I'm the only reporter in America

We have to be able to say

Until we know we've got them.

26:23.709 --> 26:25.169
- Yup.
- Go on.

26:53.363 --> 26:54.573
- Oh!
- Oh my god!

26:54.573 --> 26:55.657
- I--

26:55.657 --> 26:58.410
- I'm sorry, your roommate,
she just let me in downstairs, and I--

26:58.410 --> 27:00.537
- Wh-what are you,
what are you doing here?

27:01.330 --> 27:03.707
I, uh, brought a lamp.

27:05.626 --> 27:07.961
Yeah, you just, you weren't
answering my calls,

27:07.961 --> 27:12.341
so I thought I would stop by
and say hi and bring a lamp.

27:12.341 --> 27:15.260
Remember you told me
you didn't have one for your room?

27:19.348 --> 27:20.849
How long have you had that knife?

27:20.849 --> 27:22.559
- I, I don't know, it helps the--

27:23.519 --> 27:24.645
it helps me sleep.

27:33.654 --> 27:36.990
When you were at Theranos,
did you ever hear of Ian Gibbons?

27:39.576 --> 27:40.661
Maybe.

27:43.664 --> 27:46.834
- Carreyrou told me that
he was a chemist there.

27:50.045 --> 27:52.673
They were pressuring him so much that, um,

27:55.217 --> 27:56.426
he killed himself.

28:01.557 --> 28:03.433
I keep thinking about him.

28:07.479 --> 28:08.772
Yeah, it's, uh...

28:10.732 --> 28:11.900
It's bad right now.

28:14.403 --> 28:15.988
They're suing me.

28:17.531 --> 28:19.283
My grandfather stopped talking to me.

28:19.283 --> 28:22.452
They're tracking everything I do.

28:33.297 --> 28:35.257
At least now you have an ugly lamp.

29:03.368 --> 29:05.829
David, what are you doing here?

29:05.829 --> 29:06.997
I want to talk.

29:08.290 --> 29:10.792
- Were you in the neighborhood?
- No.

29:12.753 --> 29:15.088
The article is not going away.

29:15.756 --> 29:19.760
It's not moving forward
but it's not going away,

29:19.760 --> 29:24.389
and I can't make it go away
until I know what they have.

29:26.767 --> 29:31.104
This is the moment
where you tell me everything

29:31.104 --> 29:32.731
that you've been hiding from me.

29:32.731 --> 29:37.986
♪

29:41.406 --> 29:44.576
♪

29:44.576 --> 29:47.120
♪

29:53.168 --> 29:55.045
Oh, you need to be prepared.

29:55.045 --> 29:56.255
I'm prepared.

29:57.130 --> 29:59.967
- For, for what?
- For Boies killing your story.

29:59.967 --> 30:01.635
- No.
- He's the one that called the meeting.

30:01.635 --> 30:03.053
I'm sure he has evidence that refutes it.

30:03.053 --> 30:04.346
Judith, the story is good.

30:04.346 --> 30:06.557
I still have Dr. Betz in Arizona.

30:06.557 --> 30:08.058
I've got the nurse, Carmen Washington.

30:08.058 --> 30:10.102
I have that patient.
I have Erika Cheung,

30:10.102 --> 30:12.104
Mark Roessler, Richard Fuisz,

30:12.104 --> 30:14.481
Rochelle Gibbons, Phyllis Gardner--
On background.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.483
- And Tyler.
- You haven't heard from Tyler?

30:16.984 --> 30:19.903
- No. But that also means
I haven't heard that he's recanted.

30:19.903 --> 30:23.407
Come on. Whatever happened
to stab the fish?

30:23.407 --> 30:25.242
- Sometimes the fish
can take you to court.

30:26.743 --> 30:28.161
And then you have to let them go.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.165
So say it back to me,
you have to let the fish go.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.962
- Sometimes you have to let the fish go.
- Exactly.

30:37.754 --> 30:40.757
So thank you for coming by.

30:41.842 --> 30:43.468
This is John Carreyrou

30:43.468 --> 30:46.555
and Jay Conti, the deputy general counsel
of our parent company.

30:46.555 --> 30:47.806
Ah, hold on.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.018
Oh, are we recording?
Is this a deposition?

30:51.018 --> 30:53.437
- Nope. Just want a record.
- Well, hold on.

30:54.062 --> 30:56.231
Maybe we want to record.
What do you, what do you think?

30:56.231 --> 30:57.399
- Yeah, why not? Sure.
- Okay.

30:58.066 --> 31:01.069
So where is the app?

31:01.069 --> 31:03.322
Uh, Recorder Plus.

31:03.697 --> 31:05.782
JUDITH:
Uh-huh. And do I download it?

31:05.782 --> 31:07.784
-Yeah, go to the App Store.
-Mm-hmm.

31:07.784 --> 31:08.994
And how much is it?

31:08.994 --> 31:11.038
- No, it's free.
- Oh, okay, free.

31:11.830 --> 31:14.583
Ah, there it is.

31:14.583 --> 31:16.543
Okay, got it. You got it?

31:16.543 --> 31:17.544
-Got it.
- Got it.

31:17.544 --> 31:19.254
Can we keep moving forward?

31:19.254 --> 31:20.964
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, of course.

31:20.964 --> 31:23.759
Okay. So you sent us
80 questions for review,

31:23.759 --> 31:26.386
and we are here to rebut the false premise

31:26.386 --> 31:27.721
embedded in those questions.

31:27.721 --> 31:31.391
Now, it's apparent to us
that one of your key sources

31:31.391 --> 31:33.810
is a young man named Tyler Schultz.

31:33.810 --> 31:36.563
- We aren't disclosing
our confidential sources,

31:36.563 --> 31:38.857
nor should you presume
to know who they are.

31:38.857 --> 31:41.235
Can we move on?
You're absolutely right, Judith.

31:42.110 --> 31:44.738
I'm not asking you
to disclose your sources.

31:44.738 --> 31:47.574
I respect journalists,
and I'm trying to protect you.

31:47.574 --> 31:49.743
There just isn't a story here.

31:49.743 --> 31:51.286
Then answer my questions.

31:55.666 --> 31:56.708
John.

31:57.376 --> 31:58.335
It's John, right?

31:58.335 --> 31:59.628
It is, David.

32:00.629 --> 32:03.423
- You will make a fool
of yourself by printing this.

32:03.423 --> 32:06.009
- Mm-hmm, so you're the good cop, David?

32:06.009 --> 32:08.053
No.

32:09.179 --> 32:10.681
I'm just trying to figure out

32:11.598 --> 32:13.392
how we could have arrived at a place

32:13.392 --> 32:16.812
where <i>The Journal</i> is considering
publication of an article

32:16.812 --> 32:20.065
I know to be false, misleading,

32:20.065 --> 32:21.775
and unfair

32:21.775 --> 32:23.986
and threatens to disclose information

32:23.986 --> 32:27.072
that Theranos rigorously protects

32:27.072 --> 32:29.157
as trade secrets.

32:30.075 --> 32:33.996
Do you really believe
that all the recognition

32:33.996 --> 32:37.624
by the academic, scientific,
and healthcare communities

32:37.624 --> 32:40.794
of Theranos' achievements is wrong?

32:40.794 --> 32:44.381
That every previous published report
about Theranos,

32:44.381 --> 32:46.466
including in <i>The Journal</i> itself,

32:46.466 --> 32:50.512
has been the result
of misleading manipulation

32:50.512 --> 32:51.763
by the company?

32:52.973 --> 32:54.308
Wow.

32:54.808 --> 32:57.144
If it were true, that's a powerful story.

32:58.103 --> 32:59.813
Why would you let a story like that go?

32:59.813 --> 33:02.608
Why would you check it thoroughly?

33:03.483 --> 33:06.570
That would be a career-defining story.

33:08.071 --> 33:09.615
The only problem is

33:11.450 --> 33:13.368
none of it is true.

33:13.368 --> 33:16.288
♪

33:16.288 --> 33:19.041
♪

33:19.041 --> 33:21.460
♪

33:21.460 --> 33:23.295
Then why don't you answer my questions?

33:29.218 --> 33:32.012
I just want to know--
Here's what I want to know, John.

33:32.012 --> 33:34.431
What about your conduct in Arizona?

33:34.431 --> 33:36.725
What you were doing
down there with those doctors

33:36.725 --> 33:39.269
was nothing short of yellow journalism.

33:39.269 --> 33:41.230
- Oh, David, where'd the good cop go?
- Yellow journalism?

33:41.230 --> 33:43.649
- You were asking those doctors
loaded questions.

33:43.649 --> 33:44.733
Okay, here's a loaded question.

33:44.733 --> 33:47.694
If Theranos has new technology,
what is it?

33:47.694 --> 33:49.905
- Okay, so you want us to give you
the formula for Coke

33:49.905 --> 33:51.240
so that we can--

33:51.240 --> 33:52.574
- Nobody's asking
for the formula for Coke.

33:52.574 --> 33:55.410
- By the way, I like Pepsi.
- Okay. Just answer.

33:56.036 --> 33:59.373
Does Theranos use fingerstick samples
in their technology or not?

33:59.373 --> 34:00.499
- That's a trade secret.
Yes or no. Okay.

34:00.499 --> 34:01.500
That is a trade secret.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.627
- How about this?
This is another easy one.

34:03.627 --> 34:06.046
Are you using Siemens machines
in your labs?

34:06.046 --> 34:08.465
Yes, but for comparison purposes only.

34:08.465 --> 34:09.466
So you acknowledge you have them?

34:09.466 --> 34:11.552
For comparison purposes.

34:11.552 --> 34:12.678
- You're grasping at straws--

34:12.678 --> 34:14.638
- She said, for comparison purposes.
Move on.

34:14.638 --> 34:18.183
- Just... walk me through
some of the language

34:18.183 --> 34:19.643
that's been changed recently
on the website.

34:19.643 --> 34:21.311
Oh, language on the website?

34:21.311 --> 34:25.899
- The phrase, "Many of our tests
only require a few drops of blood."

34:25.899 --> 34:27.651
That phrase was recently deleted.

34:27.651 --> 34:29.528
Yes, for marketing accuracy.

34:32.865 --> 34:33.991
Accuracy?

34:34.950 --> 34:37.536
So you characterize
the language before as inaccurate?

34:37.536 --> 34:38.495
Alright.

34:39.121 --> 34:41.874
We will acknowledge
that not every blood test

34:41.874 --> 34:44.376
is run on proprietary technology,

34:44.376 --> 34:47.045
but they're transitioning.

34:47.045 --> 34:49.965
It's a transitional process. A journey.

34:51.592 --> 34:52.759
A journey.

34:55.721 --> 34:57.014
A journey.

34:58.682 --> 35:00.142
Alright. This meeting's over.

35:00.142 --> 35:02.853
- W-- well, it's only been four hours.

35:02.853 --> 35:03.770
I mean--

35:09.651 --> 35:13.614
♪

35:17.159 --> 35:18.785
Oh my god, holy shit.

35:19.953 --> 35:21.872
- They admitted to using
third-party analyzers.

35:21.872 --> 35:22.748
They sure did.

35:22.748 --> 35:25.083
- Yeah. After months of saying
they don't use third-party analyzers.

35:25.083 --> 35:26.668
- They sure did.
- So, Judith...

35:27.794 --> 35:29.588
- is this--
- Bam!

35:39.264 --> 35:41.934
Elizabeth, they're running it.

35:41.934 --> 35:43.602
So when will it come out?

35:44.228 --> 35:46.271
ELIZABETH:
Uh, I don't know. Soon.

35:47.397 --> 35:50.526
I spoke to Rupert and asked him
to kill the story, but, uh--

35:50.526 --> 35:52.361
You asked Rupert Murdoch

35:53.362 --> 35:55.989
to kill a story in
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> for you?

35:55.989 --> 35:57.449
Of course.

35:57.449 --> 35:58.867
He told me that his hands are tied.

35:59.660 --> 36:03.038
I don't understand why
he can't just make a phone call.

36:03.580 --> 36:04.873
How bad will it be?

36:05.999 --> 36:07.417
Nothing we can't handle.

36:11.338 --> 36:12.506
George...

36:13.298 --> 36:15.843
I want to know that I have your support.

36:18.428 --> 36:19.680
I hear

36:21.682 --> 36:26.728
you're joining the Harvard Medical School
Board of Fellows.

36:27.312 --> 36:30.357
Congratulations. You must be riding high.

36:31.942 --> 36:34.611
- I know! A college dropout
joining the board

36:34.611 --> 36:36.864
of a Harvard Medical School.

36:37.865 --> 36:39.867
Obviously, Harvard's support
of our company

36:39.867 --> 36:42.870
means more to me than a reporter
who doesn't understand.

36:42.870 --> 36:44.246
Elizabeth...

36:45.956 --> 36:47.708
I've worked for two presidents,

36:49.334 --> 36:50.836
Nixon and Reagan,

36:52.546 --> 36:54.214
who made bad decisions.

36:56.091 --> 36:57.509
Nixon, more so.

36:59.011 --> 37:00.137
But Reagan

37:01.930 --> 37:05.017
got mixed up in the Iran-Contra affair,

37:06.852 --> 37:08.729
and it hurt his legacy.

37:09.271 --> 37:10.647
He was a great man.

37:13.317 --> 37:15.527
But he started listening
to the wrong people.

37:16.653 --> 37:20.532
It's easy to make the mistake
of listening to the wrong people.

37:22.242 --> 37:23.785
If mistakes were made...

37:25.704 --> 37:28.373
I think it might be time
to consider whether you have

37:28.373 --> 37:30.083
the right people around you.

37:34.129 --> 37:36.381
If Sunny is the right person.

37:43.805 --> 37:46.725
Baby, how did it go with George?

37:52.064 --> 37:54.274
I said, how did it go with George?

37:55.400 --> 37:57.986
- I have to pack for my Harvard Board
dinner tonight and I don't--

37:57.986 --> 37:59.279
I laid out your clothes.

37:59.279 --> 38:01.073
- Yeah, I don't want to wear
what you picked out.

38:01.073 --> 38:02.366
Just wear it, why don't you?

38:11.500 --> 38:14.378
- I don't know what
I'm supposed to fucking do.

38:14.378 --> 38:15.921
I don't even know
when it's going to come out.

38:15.921 --> 38:17.172
I don't know what it's going to say.

38:18.674 --> 38:20.133
You should have protected me.

38:21.051 --> 38:21.969
Okay.

38:22.511 --> 38:23.554
I see.

38:25.097 --> 38:26.515
George told you to blame me.

38:28.642 --> 38:30.602
That's what you're going to do?
You're going to blame me?

38:30.602 --> 38:31.687
No.

38:32.396 --> 38:33.814
Of course not.

38:35.232 --> 38:37.150
I have to meet the jet.

38:43.574 --> 38:45.701
Because I know everything that you know.

38:45.701 --> 38:47.661
- What?

38:49.913 --> 38:51.874
- You were on all of those e-mails.

39:02.009 --> 39:03.218
Well, I'm the CEO.

39:05.012 --> 39:07.222
And I don't always read all of my e-mails.

39:15.063 --> 39:16.398
I love you, Tiger.

39:19.401 --> 39:20.986
I miss you already.

39:22.946 --> 39:23.989
Miss you too.

39:36.502 --> 39:38.212
- Richard.
<i>They killed it.</i>

39:38.212 --> 39:39.546
<i>It's dead.</i>

39:40.714 --> 39:42.007
You fucked it up.

39:43.008 --> 39:44.593
I knew it.

39:44.593 --> 39:47.054
You got cocky and you fucked it up.

39:47.054 --> 39:49.181
<i>I'm taking it somewhere else.</i>

39:49.181 --> 39:51.266
It's too late for that.

39:51.266 --> 39:54.102
- Oh, is that right?
Is that what you think?

39:54.102 --> 39:56.772
Hah. No way, buddy. No way!

39:56.772 --> 39:59.733
It's running tonight, buddy.

40:01.026 --> 40:03.403
- Tonight? What? The--
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

40:04.029 --> 40:05.197
<i>Really?</i>

40:06.365 --> 40:07.491
Yes!

40:07.908 --> 40:09.409
That's, uh, good.

40:10.327 --> 40:12.454
That's good. You, you got it done.

40:13.580 --> 40:14.706
Yeah, well, you're welcome.

40:14.706 --> 40:16.917
Oh, what, am I supposed to thank you?

40:16.917 --> 40:18.669
I gave it to you on a plate.

40:19.962 --> 40:21.839
- I hope you can go out tonight,
have a drink,

40:21.839 --> 40:23.090
celebrate with your family.

40:23.090 --> 40:24.800
With my family.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.426
Uh, good.

40:26.426 --> 40:29.721
Uh, well, uh, goodbye.

40:29.721 --> 40:31.598
If, if you get anything wrong,
I'll call you.

40:31.598 --> 40:34.685
I'm expecting you to. Goodnight.

40:36.687 --> 40:38.564
Oh yes.

40:38.939 --> 40:41.567
Yes! Yes! Yes!

40:45.195 --> 40:47.489
Oh! Good!

40:47.948 --> 40:48.991
Yes!

40:52.995 --> 40:54.955
Ahh.

40:56.039 --> 40:57.374
Oh good.

40:59.251 --> 41:00.544
That's done.

41:14.975 --> 41:17.019
Hi. Could have a glass of water, please?

41:20.063 --> 41:21.481
A whiskey with ice.

41:28.155 --> 41:30.407
- Phyllis, I saw you were
on the board as well.

41:30.866 --> 41:32.618
I am, yes, and now you are too.

41:32.618 --> 41:36.330
- Yes, I'm, I'm so honored
to be asked to advise

41:36.330 --> 41:38.457
the dean of Medical School on strategies.

41:38.916 --> 41:40.250
It is an honor.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.544
- Yeah, it is good to see you--

41:42.544 --> 41:44.755
- I'm looking forward to reading
the article in the <i>Journal.</i>

41:45.214 --> 41:46.673
Yes, I know about it.

41:46.673 --> 41:49.009
I think a lot of people
will be interested in it.

41:50.302 --> 41:53.597
And when this becomes a scandal,
because it will become a scandal,

41:53.597 --> 41:56.600
what do you think happens
to all of the other women

41:56.600 --> 41:58.227
who want to start companies?

41:59.394 --> 42:00.604
Who do they go to?

42:01.897 --> 42:03.524
Who's going to trust them?

42:05.192 --> 42:06.485
Because it's not just you.

42:08.779 --> 42:10.072
It's never just you.

42:12.366 --> 42:14.034
It was good to see you, Phyllis.

42:14.034 --> 42:15.869
- Don't call me Phyllis.
I'm not Phyllis to you.

42:15.869 --> 42:16.995
I'm Dr. Gardner.

42:53.699 --> 42:55.450
<i>You know,
I realized something last night.</i>

42:57.202 --> 42:58.328
This is what happens.

42:59.997 --> 43:02.499
This is what happens
when you work to change things.

43:02.499 --> 43:04.501
<i>First, they think you're crazy.</i>

43:05.544 --> 43:06.503
<i>And then they fight you.</i>

43:07.713 --> 43:09.464
<i>And then all of a sudden
you change the world.</i>

43:10.299 --> 43:12.593
By now, you've probably seen
the article published

43:12.593 --> 43:15.220
about our company
in <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

43:15.971 --> 43:18.348
<i>The man who wrote it, John Carreyrou,</i>

43:18.348 --> 43:19.808
<i>is a spiteful man.</i>

43:20.684 --> 43:22.686
He is a sad man.

43:23.896 --> 43:25.731
But we are a team.

43:26.648 --> 43:28.650
And we will be fighting
