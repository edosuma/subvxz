WEBVTT

02:44.998 --> 02:48.417
One of Norma's breakfasts.
Made special.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.798
God bless Norma.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.843
Maybe later. Maybe later, thanks.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.681
How's things at the station?

03:02.849 --> 03:05.475
Earle's chess game
is the big concern.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.020
The man has a poor sense
of recreation.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.105
Yeah.

03:10.273 --> 03:13.358
We're holding up, for now.

03:13.860 --> 03:19.198
Hey, you and Cooper can handle it.
It's a pretty simple town.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.118
Used to be.

03:25.330 --> 03:30.083
I guess the world's
just caught up to us.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.900
Annie.

03:57.695 --> 04:00.030
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.368
Shelly, this is my sister, Annie.

04:04.535 --> 04:08.580
Hi, Annie. Welcome.
Norma's told me all about you.

04:10.124 --> 04:13.794
- All about me?
- Shelly's like family.

04:13.962 --> 04:17.256
With our family, that's not exactly
a character reference.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.259
How did you and Mom get along?

04:20.426 --> 04:23.387
Well, we can talk about her,
or we can feel good about things.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.264
I vote for plan B.

04:25.431 --> 04:29.351
Me too. I'm glad you're here.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.895
Feels a little strange. The real world.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.815
Little things, like I'd almost forgotten
how to use money.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.193
Closest we'd get in the convent
was bingo chips.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.781
No charity, Norma. Promise.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.535
Don't worry,
I'm gonna work you till you drop.

04:50.873 --> 04:51.999
Compelling.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.024
Harry's about to hit bottom.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.609
Is he eating?

05:22.905 --> 05:24.990
When do you think
he'll come back to work?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.909
I guess we'll find out soon.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.911
Need a hand?

05:30.079 --> 05:32.080
That's a question
I should be asking you.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.041
You're the senior lawman, Cooper.

05:34.208 --> 05:37.544
Let's just let the rain fall
as it has been.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.255
Besides, I hate paperwork.

05:40.923 --> 05:44.551
This is worse than the Bureau,
with all its international documentation.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.721
Eckhardt, Josie...

05:48.473 --> 05:50.223
This is the autopsy on her.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.477
Doc Hayward said
he couldn't determine cause of death.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.563
The body only weighed 65 pounds.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.317
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.570
Maybe something to do with
what I saw in the room when she died.

06:03.738 --> 06:07.115
Maybe we'd better just whistle
on our way past the graveyard.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.619
- Yeah.
- Anything on Earle?

06:11.996 --> 06:17.000
Trail's stone-cold.
Still waiting for his response.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.518
- Slip.
- Slippers.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.024
You know, Leo,
you can't really appreciate

06:41.192 --> 06:48.490
how tonic country life is
until you're actually right here, living it.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.993
- Pipe?
- Splendid.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.829
Mm.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.623
Even if you've been
to the country before,

06:56.791 --> 07:00.961
when you try to imagine
what it would be like to go back,

07:01.129 --> 07:03.630
the image is imperfect.

07:03.798 --> 07:08.427
The mental image
is always imperfect.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.762
Am I right?

07:11.264 --> 07:14.850
Tacit agreement is acceptable, Leo.

07:15.518 --> 07:19.020
Your silence speaks volumes.

07:19.188 --> 07:24.484
Or if not volumes, at least the
occasional unpunctuated paragraph.

07:26.904 --> 07:33.034
Well, let's see what move our poor
Cooper's come up with this time.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.582
Uh-huh.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.343
This isn't a move.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.221
This is a trick.

07:54.056 --> 07:57.309
He's playing a stalemate game.

07:58.853 --> 08:03.148
Cooper doesn't know
the meaning of stalemate!

08:05.067 --> 08:07.194
He's getting help.

08:11.991 --> 08:17.245
I cannot tolerate people
who do not play by the rules.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.581
People who shirk the standards!

08:24.629 --> 08:30.592
Many people are going to regret this.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.672
Got it?

09:10.925 --> 09:14.803
Ladies, may I say,

09:14.971 --> 09:20.058
you'll both delightfully represent

09:20.226 --> 09:24.396
the sanctity of nature.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.606
Cigarette?

09:26.774 --> 09:29.317
I prefer to keep my chest clear.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.694
Ah.

09:30.861 --> 09:34.447
The great god, fitness.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.327
- Have you spoken with Pinkle?
- What's a Pinkle?

09:39.495 --> 09:41.997
He's giving a talk
on the pine-weasel.

09:42.164 --> 09:45.750
- The endangered animal.
- Oh, lovely.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.003
What is it? A raccoon or something?

09:48.170 --> 09:49.963
A ferret.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.172
Audrey?

09:51.340 --> 09:53.341
Oh, great.
You two should coordinate.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.927
You are dreaming.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.308
Hello.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.852
Looks like you're trying
to run lumber upstream.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.229
How can I help you, Mr. Wheeler?

10:06.397 --> 10:09.024
Horne. Well, the talk
that we had at dinner.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.318
- I can't...
- I'm sorry, I was rude, wasn't I?

10:11.485 --> 10:14.154
It's just that when it comes
to my family, I get a little excitable.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.282
- Who am I to waltz in out of nowhere?
- We need help. Anyone can see that,

10:17.450 --> 10:20.535
and I can't think of anyone
better qualified for the job than you.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.580
Hello?

10:24.457 --> 10:26.374
What are we talking about, anyway?

10:26.542 --> 10:28.543
I was apologizing
and you were apologizing.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.880
We're both real sorry about something.
You wanna go out somewhere?

10:32.923 --> 10:34.507
Bad time, right? It's not good?

10:34.675 --> 10:36.176
Oh, no, no, it's great.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.178
How about a picnic?

10:39.138 --> 10:43.224
Uh-huh. Um, we need outdoors stuff.
A basket, blanket...

10:43.726 --> 10:45.435
Food.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.896
I don't know how to cook.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.815
I'll bet you someone
in the kitchen does.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.152
This is just to show people
what the pine-weasel looks like.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.571
I understand the concept perfectly,
Mr. Dinkle.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.281
Pinkle. The name is Pinkle.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.910
But what I'm trying to make clear
is that using a stuffed animal

11:02.078 --> 11:05.205
to represent an endangered species
as an ecological protest

11:05.373 --> 11:09.542
constitutes the supreme incongruity.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.380
Well, that's clear, Dick.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.593
Harry?

11:20.262 --> 11:21.388
Hey, Coop.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.391
We got Josie's dossier
in from Interpol.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.769
Not interested.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.896
In addition to killing Eckhardt,
trying to kill me

11:30.064 --> 11:32.482
- and killing Jonathan in Seattle...
- Closed cases.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.860
...she's also wanted for a variety
of felonies in Hong Kong.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.362
I don't need to hear this.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.989
She's also had
two prostitution arrests, Harry.

11:50.292 --> 11:56.256
Harry, eventually it's gonna help you
to know she was a hardened criminal.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.341
A killer.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.095
Get out of here.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.431
I know it's not easy right now.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.725
Just get out of here.

12:08.936 --> 12:12.105
Get out of here! Go!

12:32.585 --> 12:34.127
The door was open.

12:34.628 --> 12:38.965
A country habit. We're all so trusting.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.885
My name is Jones.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.596
I was executive assistant
to the late Mr. Eckhardt.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.643
Thank you.

13:00.988 --> 13:04.491
I've come to expedite the transport
of his body back to Hong Kong.

13:07.328 --> 13:11.873
Tragic, what happened.
You know, he really did love Josie.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.167
Didn't we all?

13:15.294 --> 13:17.420
They're going to be buried
side by side.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.841
So they can keep an eye
on each other.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.636
I guess you have your reasons
to be bitter.

13:25.387 --> 13:29.015
Oh, just call me a healthy skeptic.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.936
Now, why did you really
come to see me?

13:35.147 --> 13:38.817
I came here to give you a gift.
May I?

13:38.984 --> 13:40.860
I don't think so.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.410
Slowly.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.093
From Thomas.

14:06.387 --> 14:10.014
I have a few things to tidy up.
Then I'll be leaving tonight.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.726
Good luck, Mrs. Martell.

14:28.784 --> 14:33.204
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Bill or Eileen Hayward.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.249
Well, they're not here right now.
Can I help you?

14:36.417 --> 14:38.668
Well, I'm Dr. Gerald Craig,

14:38.836 --> 14:41.629
an old friend of Will's
from medical school.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.883
And, well, you see,
I have a convention in Spokane,

14:45.050 --> 14:49.596
and so I just thought I'd swing by
and surprise them.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.097
Which daughter are you?

14:51.265 --> 14:54.601
- Oh. Donna.
- Donna.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.437
Would you like to come in,
Dr. Craig?

14:58.063 --> 15:00.773
I'd appreciate that.

15:14.872 --> 15:18.333
Can I get you something to drink,
Dr. Craig? A pop or something?

15:18.500 --> 15:21.210
Thank you, no, no. Uh...

15:21.378 --> 15:24.255
Is this your local paper?

15:24.423 --> 15:26.174
Yeah. Pretty small town, huh?

15:26.342 --> 15:29.719
Now, don't knock small towns
until you've lived in the city.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.763
Donna, you know,

15:31.931 --> 15:37.685
it seems like Will has found himself
a little piece of heaven here.

15:39.313 --> 15:43.232
Now, don't you have two sisters?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.569
- Yeah, they're younger than me.
- Are they both as beautiful as you?

15:46.737 --> 15:48.738
Heh. Well, I don't know.

15:51.700 --> 15:57.330
You know, your dad and I,
we used to sit around

15:57.498 --> 16:01.167
and try to figure
how our lives would work out.

16:01.335 --> 16:07.298
And it seems like he's come
a little closer to the mark than I have.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.552
- You're in high school?
- Unfortunately.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.389
- I felt exactly the same way.
- Heh.

16:14.556 --> 16:17.225
You know, high school is difficult,
you know.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.894
You have no idea
what you want to do with your life,

16:20.062 --> 16:23.731
so it seems that absolutely none of it
applies to your life.

16:23.899 --> 16:25.858
- You're right.
- Heh, heh.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.611
Well, don't worry. It'll all work out.

16:28.779 --> 16:33.366
For now, you just enjoy it
in all its absurdity.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.284
Okay.

16:35.452 --> 16:39.622
Oh, I have a small gift for your dad.

16:39.790 --> 16:45.003
Now, can I trust you not to open it?

16:45.170 --> 16:47.338
- Sure.
- Ha, ha.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.632
You know, speaking of school,

16:49.800 --> 16:53.594
Will and I graduated
30 years ago this month.

16:53.762 --> 16:57.765
So I...
It's a small remembrance for him.

16:57.933 --> 17:00.601
Well, I should be on my way.

17:00.769 --> 17:04.647
Oh, this is the number
where I'm staying.

17:05.399 --> 17:09.277
I hope to see you later, Donna.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.279
Me too.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.446
How are you holding up, Pete?

17:54.114 --> 17:59.786
I've been through every
stalemate game in recorded history.

17:59.953 --> 18:04.290
And I've jerry-rigged
a few of these country standoffs

18:04.458 --> 18:06.584
that they don't write about in books.

18:06.752 --> 18:11.130
But it's no use. I mean,
there isn't a stalemate game on earth

18:11.298 --> 18:15.718
that you don't lose
at least a few foot soldiers.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.678
I mean, the classic Herbstman.

18:18.263 --> 18:22.934
You wind up with six pieces.
Now, I can improve on that.

18:23.102 --> 18:27.438
But even if I get there in half the time
and wind up with 12,

18:28.357 --> 18:32.735
that means six people die.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.447
Do your best, Pete.

18:36.615 --> 18:40.785
Windom Earle's genius carries with it
the vice of impatience.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.497
He doesn't want pawns.
He wants royalty.

18:44.665 --> 18:48.292
Protect those, particularly the queen,
and we can frustrate him.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.962
You can't do that.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.089
My students.

18:53.549 --> 18:58.219
Mr. Martell, Andy moved his knight
without doing the little hook thing.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.222
You don't have to do
the little hook thing. That's optional.

19:01.390 --> 19:07.478
Andy, the knight
has to do the little hook thing.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.982
- Every time?
- It's a privilege.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.235
No one else gets to make that move.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.530
Okay, Mr. Martell.

19:20.075 --> 19:24.787
I guess some people don't know
quite as much as they think they do.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.040
Check.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.678
We thought it best
we come see you.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.644
As you know,
that pattern on the back of my neck

19:48.812 --> 19:52.356
appeared during
my experience with...

19:52.524 --> 19:55.943
Of course,
no idea as to how it got there.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.987
And you noticed it today?

19:58.155 --> 20:01.574
My log noticed. I remember.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.326
What do you remember, Margaret?

20:04.703 --> 20:07.580
Look at the back of my leg.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.886
I was 7 years old.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.722
I went walking up in the woods,

20:24.890 --> 20:30.478
and when I got back, I was told
that I had disappeared for a day.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.564
All I could recall was a flash of light,

20:34.483 --> 20:37.443
and that mark was on my leg.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.571
We all three recall the light.

20:41.114 --> 20:44.867
And also the call of the owl.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.954
Yes, I remember.

20:48.121 --> 20:53.334
The only other time I saw that sight
and heard that sound

20:53.502 --> 20:56.837
was right before my husband died.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.048
In the fire.

21:07.307 --> 21:11.769
- I'm connecting with something.
- Yes.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.771
What?

21:15.691 --> 21:17.984
I don't know.

21:20.362 --> 21:23.239
Oh, bury me not

21:23.407 --> 21:29.036
On the old prairie
Where the coyotes howl

21:29.204 --> 21:32.248
And the wind blows free

21:32.749 --> 21:38.212
In a narrow grave
Six-by-3

21:38.380 --> 21:41.799
Don't bury me now

21:41.967 --> 21:45.177
On the lone prairie

21:46.680 --> 21:48.055
Um...

21:49.308 --> 21:51.350
No one's ever sung a song
to me before.

21:52.769 --> 21:55.313
You must have been serenaded
at least once or twice.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.734
I don't inspire much singing.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.195
Most boys are afraid.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.990
Well, they don't know you, then.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.410
Not really.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.747
I don't think
anybody really knows me.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.126
It sounds like a warning.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.170
I know.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.256
If there's another guy...

22:25.719 --> 22:30.264
There was someone,
but not anymore.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.308
There's nobody.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.854
So, what do you wanna do now?

22:39.858 --> 22:41.942
Know anymore cowboy tricks?

22:43.028 --> 22:45.154
If you've got a lariat
in that picnic basket,

22:45.322 --> 22:46.906
I could lasso passing cattle.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.284
I don't think there's a cow for miles.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.662
Stray dogs, raccoons,
birds, weasels.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.316
You had a visitor.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.026
Who's that?

23:24.194 --> 23:28.614
Somebody you went to medical school
with named Gerald Craig.

23:29.074 --> 23:33.327
Gerald Craig?
That's not possible, Donna.

23:34.079 --> 23:37.623
Well, yeah. He said he was on his way
to a convention in Spokane.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.125
He knew everything about me.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.885
Here's his number, and this.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.852
Gerald Craig was my roommate.

23:58.019 --> 24:01.105
He drowned on a rafting trip
on the Snake River.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.275
I was there, Donna.
I tried to save him.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.734
Well, then...

24:07.237 --> 24:09.655
It's a cemetery.

24:17.164 --> 24:20.583
Knight to King's Bishop 3.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.464
That man, he's very dangerous.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.591
Don't let him in here again,
do you understand?

24:28.758 --> 24:32.761
- Sure.
- I've gotta take this to Cooper.

24:41.354 --> 24:45.107
Nadine, what I'm here
to say to you is, uh...

24:48.028 --> 24:50.279
Seeing how you're with Mike now...

24:50.447 --> 24:54.116
It's so cute the way
you get embarrassed.

24:54.743 --> 24:59.079
And, uh,
since I have found someone else...

25:00.248 --> 25:02.625
Nadine, I'm not sure
you're gonna understand this.

25:02.792 --> 25:05.419
Of course I understand, Eddie.

25:05.587 --> 25:08.756
This isn't just a little spat.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.509
Nadine, um,

25:11.676 --> 25:14.637
do you know
what Ed is suggesting?

25:14.804 --> 25:20.059
It's not too obvious.
We're not, like, talking relativity here.

25:20.227 --> 25:24.605
We're breaking up.
Major, final breakup.

25:24.773 --> 25:29.777
Well, yes, technically,
I guess it is a breakup, but, uh...

25:29.945 --> 25:32.696
Well, it's a little more
than that, Nadine.

25:32.864 --> 25:36.200
Ed, you are so serious.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.411
These are the dating years.

25:39.579 --> 25:43.040
You're acting like
this is some really big deal.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.625
Doc?

25:44.793 --> 25:50.756
Ed, there are no secret tricks
or magic words.

25:50.924 --> 25:56.136
It's like the dissolving
of scar tissue around a wound.

25:56.304 --> 26:02.017
She'll start to see reality again
when her mind begins to feel safe.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.353
Well, when will that be?

26:04.521 --> 26:06.272
I can't say.

26:06.439 --> 26:09.024
That tissue's packed in there
pretty hard.

26:09.192 --> 26:14.029
Okay. Well, one thing
I really don't wanna see, Ed,

26:14.197 --> 26:19.910
are any incidents with Mike.
No jealous rages.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.914
Well, maybe just one.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.083
I give up.

26:28.503 --> 26:35.342
Nadine, you and Ed
are about to get a divorce.

26:39.139 --> 26:43.851
I think I've gone blind in my left eye.

27:34.903 --> 27:38.864
- Shelly?
- Yeah.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.034
Have you seen this?

27:42.786 --> 27:44.870
Oh, "Miss Twin Peaks."

27:47.374 --> 27:49.833
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.461
There's a cash prize
and a scholarship.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.673
- I bet you could walk away with it.
- I don't think so.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.967
It's easy, you give a speech,
you answer a few questions...

28:00.428 --> 28:02.304
Miss Double R Diner,

28:02.472 --> 28:06.141
what would you do
to bring about world peace?

28:06.309 --> 28:10.813
Well, I would
bring all the world leaders together,

28:10.980 --> 28:14.149
make them form a circle
and join hands.

28:14.317 --> 28:15.818
Because you can't make a fist

28:15.985 --> 28:17.861
- holding hands.
- You're a shoo-in.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.156
I have an order up.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.002
Here's your burger.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.046
What's with the dance?

28:36.214 --> 28:40.592
Oh, heh, my boss told me I should
enter a pageant. Miss Twin Peaks.

28:41.094 --> 28:45.347
You can kid about it,
but you are very pretty.

28:45.515 --> 28:46.974
I think you should enter it.

28:47.142 --> 28:50.018
Thanks, but I don't think
of myself as pretty.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.187
It's an inner thing, you know.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.955
Would you like something to drink?

29:10.123 --> 29:15.586
Yes, I'd like a cup
of deep black joe, please.

29:16.629 --> 29:17.963
Coming right up.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.182
You must be Norma's sister.

29:28.349 --> 29:30.017
I'm Annie.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.937
- How did you know?
- Dale Cooper. Local law enforcement.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.732
Must keep you pretty busy.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.609
Sure does.

29:41.529 --> 29:44.531
Are you, uh,
staying in town for a while?

29:45.074 --> 29:46.533
I might be here quite a while.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.911
It's happened to me.

29:49.412 --> 29:50.913
Looks like it's grown on you.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.248
It has a way of doing that.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.472
I made it a little strong.

30:09.349 --> 30:10.974
Okay.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.739
You made it just right, Annie.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.424
We've got a problem
at the Book House.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.136
Agent Cooper, Hawk,
the sheriff's gone off.

30:48.304 --> 30:50.848
He's broken every piece
of furniture not nailed down.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.891
I honestly don't know what to do.

30:53.059 --> 30:55.185
It's okay, Andy.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.736
Hey, Deputy Dale.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.947
How's business?

31:08.366 --> 31:11.451
Well, Harry,
it's a little complicated at the moment.

31:12.453 --> 31:16.874
That's the good thing about the law.
It doesn't breathe. You can't kill it!

31:23.047 --> 31:26.925
Harry, I've got an idea.

31:27.802 --> 31:30.012
Why don't you hand me that gun?

31:37.645 --> 31:43.483
I don't believe I've ever handed my gun
over to anybody in my entire life!

31:44.944 --> 31:48.030
This might be
a damn fine time to start.

31:51.659 --> 31:54.620
You know something else
I've never done?

31:57.540 --> 32:00.083
I've never crossed the ocean.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.922
Never got to China.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.761
She came to me.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.806
And she made everything better.

32:15.892 --> 32:19.937
Everything so much better.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.651
Harry.

32:26.694 --> 32:30.405
Your life is still your own.
Josie didn't take that with her.

32:30.573 --> 32:32.616
I should have gotten her away.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.744
I should have
taken her away from here!

32:40.291 --> 32:42.417
I loved her.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.965
She didn't have to die.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.067
I don't understand.

33:08.778 --> 33:11.947
There's a whole lot
I don't understand.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.201
We're all like that.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.344
Have somebody keep an eye
on him tonight.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.888
I've never seen him like this.

33:37.056 --> 33:39.808
It was like taking a hike
to your favorite spot

33:39.976 --> 33:42.978
and finding a hole
where the lake used to be.

33:43.479 --> 33:45.439
Josie had power.

33:46.232 --> 33:50.569
A man who doesn't love easily
loves too much.

33:50.737 --> 33:54.156
- A good man.
- The best.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.242
Keep going.

34:01.080 --> 34:06.334
That's a special honeymoon suite
for Mr. and Mrs. Hinkman?

34:06.502 --> 34:08.670
Uh, that's correct. Yes.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.505
We're from Bozeman originally.

34:10.673 --> 34:14.718
But my wife thought that it would be
nice to see the countryside.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.138
And, you know, you have some
very pretty country here in Twin Peaks.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.224
- Will you be with us long?
- Not long enough.

34:21.392 --> 34:27.481
No, just until tomorrow if that's okay,
because we're going deep-sea fishing.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.274
Oh, goody.

34:29.442 --> 34:32.360
Okay, so we'll just be
going on up now, me and...

34:32.528 --> 34:34.988
- Me and Mrs. Hinkman.
- Oh, is that Mike?

34:37.450 --> 34:41.995
Susan, uh, how are you?

34:43.081 --> 34:45.332
Fine. Um...

34:45.500 --> 34:47.834
I'll see you at school.

34:52.256 --> 34:54.508
The room, please.

34:55.593 --> 34:57.719
I think we can handle the bags.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.434
First of all,

35:04.602 --> 35:10.357
I would like to thank all of you
for this marvelous turnout.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.818
It's very gratifying to see
so many people

35:12.985 --> 35:18.782
who are sincere
about their environment.

35:18.950 --> 35:24.538
The Stop Ghostwood campaign
is a determined effort

35:24.705 --> 35:28.750
to keep the rabid development
interests from trying to turn

35:28.918 --> 35:33.755
our beautiful Northwest forests
into a monstrous amusement park,

35:33.923 --> 35:39.302
destroying animal preserves which
have been undisturbed for centuries.

35:39.470 --> 35:42.931
The little worlds
that serve as sanctums

35:43.099 --> 35:46.518
for several endangered species,

35:46.686 --> 35:53.024
not the least of which
is the little pine-weasel.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.486
Before moving along,

35:57.864 --> 36:04.369
I would just like to remind all of us
that ecology is not a luxury science.

36:04.537 --> 36:07.789
It is not about pleasant appearances.

36:07.957 --> 36:11.835
It is about survival.

36:12.003 --> 36:19.301
About whether we are all
going to make it, period.

36:20.761 --> 36:26.933
But not to understate the value
of visual pleasure,

36:27.101 --> 36:31.313
we come to the fashion show.

36:31.480 --> 36:36.651
Now, if any of you think you recognize
some of the models,

36:36.819 --> 36:39.988
it's because they are concerned
members of the community

36:40.156 --> 36:42.532
who have graciously given
of their time tonight.

36:42.700 --> 36:46.369
So, ladies and gentlemen,
to kick things off, here is our host,

36:46.537 --> 36:48.163
Richard Tremayne.

36:53.711 --> 36:57.005
Thank you. Splendid gathering.

36:57.173 --> 37:00.842
Our little Lucy
is wearing a delightful

37:01.010 --> 37:05.722
mix of warm Northern comfort
and Southern insouciance.

37:05.890 --> 37:11.144
An elegant worsted wool jacket
over a plethora of plaid,

37:11.312 --> 37:14.189
with a hint of polka dot.

37:14.774 --> 37:19.152
It's fabulous, isn't it?
A moonless night, black, slim skirt

37:19.320 --> 37:24.783
with a look that always says,
"Hey, world, I'm here."

37:34.168 --> 37:40.215
Mr. Brennan is wearing
a fire-engine-red turtleneck

37:40.383 --> 37:43.969
beneath an all-wool plaid
Pendleton shirt.

37:44.136 --> 37:49.140
He completes this look with his
red-and-black buffalo-checked jodhpurs.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.393
For the man who wants
to make a statement

37:51.560 --> 37:57.065
while retaining that casual feel,
whether he's out mastering a task

37:57.233 --> 38:01.361
or riding the breeze
of a chance meeting.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.281
That's it, Andy.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.583
At this rate, we're running late.
So if we could all

38:15.751 --> 38:18.837
sort of hurry Richard along
with some quick movement out there.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.046
I'm hot in this thing.

38:20.214 --> 38:24.843
You're hot? I'm dressed like a sheep.
All this worsted.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.344
And I think Mr. Tremayne

38:26.512 --> 38:29.180
is getting more than a little hot
with all these girls.

38:29.348 --> 38:32.100
- Our next model...
- Go, go, go.

38:34.437 --> 38:38.023
Well, if it isn't John Muir,
friend of the redwoods.

38:38.190 --> 38:41.443
Catherine, how good of you to come.

38:41.610 --> 38:45.155
Ben, darling,
who are you kidding with all this?

38:45.323 --> 38:50.035
I am absolutely 100 percent sincere.

38:50.202 --> 38:53.663
Oh, come on.
Look who you're talking to.

38:54.123 --> 38:57.000
We're in the same line of work.

38:57.168 --> 39:02.630
You've always been
a little more obvious, but this...

39:02.798 --> 39:07.302
Catherine, ahem, have you ever,
in your entire life,

39:07.470 --> 39:10.847
had an experience
that truly changed you?

39:11.015 --> 39:15.143
Please, spare me the born-again
sales pitch and level with me.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.854
You can't hope to stop
my development plans,

39:18.022 --> 39:20.565
so, what do you actually expect
to gain from all this?

39:22.902 --> 39:24.861
A first scrubbing

39:25.029 --> 39:30.075
on one of the dirtiest consciences
in the entire Northwest.

39:30.242 --> 39:34.204
And hopefully, it will happen to you.

39:35.247 --> 39:36.414
Catherine,

39:38.584 --> 39:42.003
I know what your plans
for Ghostwood are.

39:42.171 --> 39:46.883
And granted, I used to see life
exactly the way you do.

39:47.385 --> 39:52.305
And no matter how many deals
I made or how much money I made,

39:52.473 --> 39:58.186
inside, I was still a black,
miserable clod of dirt.

39:59.355 --> 40:03.733
I am finding that the one thing
that really affords you joy in life,

40:03.901 --> 40:08.321
the only authentic thing, is giving.

40:09.031 --> 40:13.701
Don't wait until you're on
your deathbed to find that out.

40:13.869 --> 40:16.413
God help you.

40:17.039 --> 40:19.124
You actually sound like you mean it.

40:20.584 --> 40:27.757
I do. For you, for me, the future.

40:29.051 --> 40:34.347
Catherine,
why don't you take this opportunity

40:34.515 --> 40:39.936
to transcend a lifetime
of megalomania and egocentricity,

40:40.104 --> 40:44.399
and write us a big fat check
to help stop Ghostwood?

40:53.784 --> 40:55.076
Mwah.

41:01.917 --> 41:04.669
And now to introduce you
to an endangered little critter

41:04.837 --> 41:06.504
whose home
is presently under attack

41:06.672 --> 41:11.843
by the proposed Ghostwood
development project, Mr. Tim Pinkle.

41:14.221 --> 41:17.765
Thank you, Dick.
Thank you, thank you.

41:20.728 --> 41:24.022
Well, hi, how's everything going?

41:28.444 --> 41:29.652
That's good.

41:29.820 --> 41:34.574
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
I have with me a little fellow

41:34.742 --> 41:39.496
who doesn't understand
the peril that awaits him.

41:39.663 --> 41:43.708
An innocent in a world gone mad.

41:43.876 --> 41:47.504
A world gone mad. Ahem.

41:47.671 --> 41:51.841
Without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

41:54.303 --> 42:01.059
I give you
the endangered pine-weasel.

42:02.353 --> 42:05.647
Now, this species
is of the weasel family.

42:05.814 --> 42:13.112
And not only is he nonaggressive
to us humans and has beautiful fur,

42:13.280 --> 42:19.202
but also, he is by nature
an excellent controller of rodents.

42:19.370 --> 42:24.165
Unfortunately, this little friendly fellow
is incredibly curious,

42:24.333 --> 42:27.919
making him very easy
for one to trap.

42:28.087 --> 42:32.298
He is also attracted to bright
shiny objects.

42:32.466 --> 42:36.052
- Must be my studs.
- Yeah. Oh. Oh.

42:36.220 --> 42:39.514
It also is amazing,
he is particularly attracted

42:39.682 --> 42:43.476
to various smells, like, believe it or not,
very cheap cologne.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.562
Oh, what's this?

42:45.729 --> 42:47.730
I think it wants
to give you a kiss, Dick.

42:47.898 --> 42:50.275
- Oh, please, Mr. Pinkle.
- Come on. Come on.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.822
- It's all right, give him a kiss.
- A kiss?

42:55.990 --> 42:59.701
Uh-huh. Attaboy. Come on.

42:59.868 --> 43:01.703
Hello there, little pilgrim...

43:04.290 --> 43:07.292
Oh, no, no, no.

43:14.300 --> 43:18.136
Nobody panic. Don't panic.
He's completely harmless.

43:18.304 --> 43:19.470
He's already endangered.

43:32.192 --> 43:35.445
Don't panic, anybody,
just don't panic.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.947
- Nobody panic.
- Please, everyone, calm down.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.491
- Stay in your seat.
- Aah!

43:42.244 --> 43:45.038
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

43:45.205 --> 43:47.081
Lot of fuss over a loose weasel.

43:47.249 --> 43:49.626
- Maybe we should help.
- I don't know.

43:49.793 --> 43:52.503
A little excitement
might do this crowd some good.

43:53.589 --> 43:57.342
- Did you come for the fashion show?
- No, I came for you.
