00:06.590 --> 00:09.081
ZOE: You said that if I had
20 hours behind the wheel,
you'd let me.

00:09.218 --> 00:12.051
Drive, as in "my car,"
not as in "get your own."

00:12.471 --> 00:15.554
Well, it's not like
I'm gonna pick up guys
and head for Vegas.

00:15.766 --> 00:18.428
Okay, now you can never
get a car of your own.

00:20.938 --> 00:22.269
Hit me again, Vincent.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.396
What's up, Jo? Big date?

00:24.983 --> 00:28.692
High school science fair,
most dangerous day
of the year.

00:28.946 --> 00:33.406
What you got,
baking soda volcanoes
and some lame fly experiments?

00:33.784 --> 00:37.197
Teens with unlimited access
to terrifying technology.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.570
lt's Armageddon with acne.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.958
Really?
What's your experiment?

00:42.709 --> 00:43.869
Flies.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.418
Oh.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.288
Well, at least you're
going with a classic.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.463
It's a dumb genetics thing.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.758
It's supposed to show
how different behavior
traits are passed

00:52.886 --> 00:54.296
from one generation
to the next.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.425
Right, like the keen Carter
investigative mind.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.389
Honey, that's not so dumb.
Thanks.

00:59.434 --> 01:02.676
It doesn't matter.
I'm gonna be humiliated
by the competition.

01:02.771 --> 01:07.185
Hey, don't say that.
You just do your best.
Forget about the competition.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.643
She's just a little insecure
about her IQ test.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.399
Her...

01:14.199 --> 01:16.110
What IQ test?

01:16.201 --> 01:18.283
Do you two even talk?

01:18.370 --> 01:19.780
Everyone at school
had to take it.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.487
Well, why am | always
the last to know?

01:22.583 --> 01:25.916
Because, it's no big deal,
and what could you
have done about it?

01:25.961 --> 01:28.247
Well, I could have told you
that I took one
when l was a kid.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.327
Really?

01:29.423 --> 01:31.254
Yes, and I did very well.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.259
I got 111.
I didn't even try
and I got over 100%.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.436
Yeah, he surprises me
sometimes, too.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.678
Your regular wheatgrass?

01:45.772 --> 01:48.149
Please, and one to go
for Dr. Stark.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.940
VINCENT: Two cups of
workout fuel, coming up.

01:50.986 --> 01:55.025
Hey, Vincent!
I'll try one of those.
Sounds very wheaty.

01:55.949 --> 01:56.938
(CHUCKLES)

01:57.075 --> 01:58.064
Do you need a
ride to school?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.153
Yeah, like five
minutes ago.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.233
Okay.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.409
CARTER: Good luck,
and don't worry about it.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.327
Your project's
gonna be great.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.079
Thanks, Dad.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.239
Just...

02:06.710 --> 02:08.666
Science fair, big day.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.668
Oh, not you, too.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.830
Why do you think
I've been working out?

02:12.924 --> 02:15.586
Oh, I hear you.
I love exercise.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.757
(GRUNTS)
Just...

02:16.845 --> 02:19.712
Pump time, find my center,
clear the ch'i.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.596
Oh, you go to the gym?

02:21.683 --> 02:24.846
Sure.
Yeah, all the time.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.023
Good stuff.

02:34.571 --> 02:38.029
NATHAN: I imagine Carter
more of a jumping-jacks,
medicine-ball kind of a guy.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.487
He says he works out
here all the time.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.868
Well, I've never seen him.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.830
And I wouldn't have
forgotten that.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.409
Hey, guys, they're...
They're loaners.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.041
I left my gym bag at home.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.336
This is the zone, right?

02:58.387 --> 03:01.800
Yeah, Carter, you remember
under the gym floor
there's a generator that

03:01.932 --> 03:03.763
produces a localized
EM field?

03:03.767 --> 03:07.760
Right. Yeah.
Oh, yeah. And the bars...

03:07.771 --> 03:09.181
Are paired with the floor.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.935
The field either
attracts or repels them
to mimic different weights.

03:14.820 --> 03:15.980
So, what you
gonna try first?

03:16.113 --> 03:17.193
How about 111?

03:17.280 --> 03:20.113
Yeah, huh?
Yeah, you heard about that.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.987
You never cease
to amaze me, Carter.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.113
So, the, uh...

03:24.246 --> 03:26.737
The science fair,
that's sort of a
"Geeks Gone Wild," huh?

03:26.832 --> 03:30.074
You know how Texans feel about
their high school football?

03:30.085 --> 03:31.825
Yep.
Child's play.

03:32.087 --> 03:35.079
A lot of G.D.'s greatest stars
were discovered at the fair.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.248
A career could
be made overnight.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.589
Yeah, but, I mean,
they're only kids. How much
trouble can they get into?

03:42.097 --> 03:46.761
I mean, Jo made it seem
like the sky was falling.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.760
(SIGHING) Well, that hasn't
happened since 2004.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.638
And that was more of an
igniting of the ionosphere.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.859
Seriously?

03:55.193 --> 03:58.310
Hey, when you're
pioneering new territory,
things happen.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.937
Truth is, we have
strict guidelines,

03:59.990 --> 04:02.777
but there's rarely been
a year where someone

04:02.868 --> 04:05.826
or something hasn't gone...

04:07.914 --> 04:09.370
"Boom."
Oh!

04:10.041 --> 04:11.747
Oh! Oh!

04:48.413 --> 04:50.654
CARTER: All right, so what's
the damage, Henry?

04:51.833 --> 04:53.744
Well, there's a hole
in the engine block.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.627
Wow, looks like
it went right through.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.253
Any idea what
could cause it?

04:58.298 --> 05:01.586
Well, given the
trajectory...

05:02.260 --> 05:03.636
A meteorite?

05:03.720 --> 05:04.709
A meteorite?

05:04.763 --> 05:05.798
Yeah.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.629
A meteorite hit my car?

05:08.558 --> 05:10.594
No, not buying it.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.644
Look, there's another
hole down there.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.027
Looks like a piece
of metal, maybe?

05:26.409 --> 05:28.070
It's way down there, though.

05:28.119 --> 05:31.611
Well, no way to get
to it without excavating.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.405
Oh, there might be.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.452
Since when do you
go to the gym?

05:38.547 --> 05:39.957
Oh, shut up.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.309
You know, two feet to the left
of my car, I'd let it go.

06:02.404 --> 06:06.943
Two feet to the right,
I'd give it to you,
but right through my car, I...

06:07.784 --> 06:08.899
I gotta check it out.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.074
I mean, maybe Jo is right.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.735
Maybe it does have something
to do with the science fair.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.574
Well, take it to the
NEAT lab at G.D.

I'll drop your car
off at my garage,

06:19.379 --> 06:22.212
but let me know
what the lab says.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.463
All right. Oh!

06:23.550 --> 06:25.415
Hey, Henry,
you're taking my car.
How am I supposed to...

06:25.510 --> 06:29.423

and Fargo is working
on something.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.635

06:41.943 --> 06:43.444

that for you?

06:43.486 --> 06:44.771

07:01.338 --> 07:02.544

to steer?

07:02.589 --> 07:04.079
I am self-navigating.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.209
SARAH, what are you doing?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.419
I just wanted to get out
of the house for a while.

07:07.510 --> 07:11.674
Dr. Fargo downloaded
me to the car.
Shall we get going?

07:11.723 --> 07:13.554
Uh, you know what?
I'm good.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.010
I think I'll walk.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.843
Come on, Sheriff,
we never go anywhere together.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.678
It’ll be an adventure.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.352
All right, fine.

07:23.401 --> 07:26.188
But watch the road,
and just try to keep it
under the speed limit,

07:26.237 --> 07:27.773

about whatever happened
to Sheriff Carter's Jeep,

07:33.411 --> 07:36.153
but I really don't think
any of our students
had anything to do with it.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.330
We have very strict
ground rules concerning
our experiments.

07:39.376 --> 07:43.710
No cloning, AI, infectious
diseases. No space-time
continuum manipulation

07:43.755 --> 07:45.746
and no G.D. technology.

07:45.840 --> 07:50.379
They're kids. Kids cheat,
especially smart ones, which
in this case is all of them.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.340
Well, I would like to think
that our students follow
the honor system.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.841

08:02.440 --> 08:04.021
I thought you were
going to suspend
those three

08:04.109 --> 08:05.770
after the stunt
that they pulled
last year.

08:05.777 --> 08:09.770
Well, we considered it,
but their contributions
proved far too valuable.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.818
Music downloaded directly
into the brain.

08:13.451 --> 08:17.285
That technology won
an Enterprise Award
and a MacArthur Genius Grant.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.996
That technology gave me
a headache for two weeks.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.948
I promise to keep
an eye out.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.423

your genetics
experiment, Zoe.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.923

what, a century ago?

Is that the best
you can do?

the hang of this.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.540
Carter, I have a briefing
to go to. Will you be okay?

11:54.589 --> 11:56.545
Yeah, never better.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.712
Hello.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.440
Dr. Finn,
I'm Sheriff Carter.
I'm the one who called you.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.399
A moment, please.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.035
(WHIRRING SOUND)

12:30.333 --> 12:32.494
Well, good thing
Eureka's a no-fly zone.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.748
It's not a ray gun.
It's a catadioptric imager.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.964
Uh, telescope
with a camera.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.969
Powerful enough
to pierce G.D.'s
electromagnetic umbrella.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.508
And today, it happens to be
six milliarc-seconds off
in right ascension,

12:49.602 --> 12:52.309
so you can guess the kind
of day that I am having.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.603
The worst.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.773
Uh, maybe I should
talk to someone else
in your neato lab?

12:57.527 --> 13:01.691
Sorry, it'sjust me.
The director is at
a conference in Hawaii.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.697
But, hey, I get to stay
and watch the equipment,

13:04.784 --> 13:08.902
and I get to look at
your little rock.
Highlight of my week.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.287
Yeah, like I said,
I'm not sure what it is.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.410
Well, it's doubtful
that it came from space.

13:13.501 --> 13:17.494
The lab tracks all
known objects large enough
to enter Earth's atmosphere.

13:17.547 --> 13:22.667
Wow. So, you guard the Earth
from total destruction.
That's a pretty cool gig.

13:22.719 --> 13:26.382
No, I keep the telescope
working while others
go to Hawaii.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.931
So, is it a meteorite?
Not unless it was
made in China.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.926
A meteorite is a rock.
That is man-made.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.853
Probably a fragment off a
Chinese weather satellite.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.684
Wait. A fragment?

13:37.859 --> 13:40.271
Yeah, space is full ofjunk.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.858
Bits of satellites,
tools lost during
shuttle missions.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.280
How many we talking?

13:47.035 --> 13:51.119
Over the last 40 years,
maybe a couple
hundred thousand in all.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.866
Couple hundred thousand?

13:52.957 --> 13:55.289
There's no need to
stockpile the batteries
and the bottled water.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.413
An impact like this
happens once in
a lifetime, so just...

13:58.504 --> 14:00.335
(BOOMING)

14:04.010 --> 14:05.750
(EXPLOSION)

14:06.429 --> 14:07.919
Or twice.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.518
CARTER: Well, it looks like
we found the rest
of our Chinese satellite.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.598
FINN: I don't think so.
Almost done mapping it now.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.149
Whoa. What is that?

14:22.278 --> 14:24.769
It's a portable
computer axial tomographer.

14:24.822 --> 14:28.690
We take a 3D image
and then we pipe it into a
set-point topology program.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.487
What is that?

14:33.623 --> 14:37.207
(LAUGHING)
That would be a toilet.

14:37.293 --> 14:42.162
Specifically, a zero-gravity
urinal developed by NASA
called an Opti-can.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.747
It was discarded
by ISS years ago.

14:45.760 --> 14:49.423
What are the odds of two
pieces of space junk hitting
Eureka on the same day?

14:49.472 --> 14:51.588
Well, random events
do tend to cluster together,

14:51.599 --> 14:54.341
but I'll admit,
that's a bit of a coincidence.

14:54.769 --> 14:55.929
A bit of a coincidence?

14:56.020 --> 14:58.511
The computers
create orbit
determination images

14:58.606 --> 14:59.971
every 24 hours.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.723
The next one will
be done at 6:00 tonight.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.649
All right, well,
let's see if we can
step up the timetable.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.819
A lot of things could hit us
between now and 6:00.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.277
FINN: This is from yesterday.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.817
The green circles are objects
whose trajectories
have been projected

15:12.912 --> 15:14.903
and pose no risk to Earth.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.158
They're definitely in STABO.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.449
Stable orbit.
I was gonna get it.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.834
Can we see
what you got for today?

15:22.630 --> 15:25.121
Yeah, the director

15:25.174 --> 15:27.916
doesn't let me evaluate
raw data before
it's been compiled,

15:27.969 --> 15:29.800
unless it's an emergency,
and I got to...

15:29.887 --> 15:32.970
Finn, a metal toilet
plowed into a field.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.722
Right.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.637
Well, this image won't be
complete for eight hours,

15:37.687 --> 15:40.474
but it'll give you
a general idea of...

15:40.523 --> 15:42.229
Okay, that's not good.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.232
The debris field is
coalescing into
geosynchronous orbit.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.651
And their course has been
unnaturally altered.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.603
They're all coming to Eureka.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.898
So, that means if we
don't figure out
what's causing this,

15:51.993 --> 15:53.199
what happened
to my Jeep this morning...

15:53.286 --> 15:54.651
Is just the beginning.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.246
Should we call NORAD
or something?

15:59.333 --> 16:01.460
Are you kidding?
NORAD calls us.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.584
I've re-tasked our
satellites to scan
for anything

16:03.629 --> 16:05.711
that could be
affecting objects in orbit.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.088
Henry and Finn are
working on a real-time
inertial track

16:08.134 --> 16:10.250
to pinpoint where
the debris could hit.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.794
Okay, I'll sound the alarm.
I'll cancel the science fair.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.221
No, the science fair
is happening in the safest
place in town.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.426
It was built as a shelter.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.596
It has a cubic boron
nitrate roof, dynamic
vector shielding...

16:19.645 --> 16:21.556
Well, unless it holds
3,000 people,

16:21.606 --> 16:23.392
we're still going to need
to evacuate the town.

16:23.441 --> 16:27.400
To where? A debris cloud
like this could fall across
500 square miles.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.733
Until we have a hard track,
we don't know
where this stuff could hit.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.442
Taggart, those things
better be housebroken.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.787
You bring a creature
into the world.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.708
You try to prepare her for any
challenge she might encounter.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.548
Where did I go wrong?

16:52.595 --> 16:54.551
We do the best we can. Right?

16:55.389 --> 16:57.766
I can't help feeling
I've failed them.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.558
Oh! You... Whoa!

17:04.649 --> 17:09.359
It's hard to see
what's going on inside you,
my little winged angel.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.608
Taggan,
what the hell are...

17:16.536 --> 17:19.323
I don't know whether
to be disturbed or relieved.

17:23.334 --> 17:27.168
They're mechanical,
but still close to my heart.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.882
Did I make a hash
of their software?

17:32.927 --> 17:34.588
Internal compass?

17:34.887 --> 17:36.263
(SNIFFLING)

17:37.265 --> 17:39.051
Maybe it's the wing design.

17:39.100 --> 17:43.389
Can I ask you why you built
a flock of robo-birds?

17:43.437 --> 17:47.430
I just modified
a military design to track
migration patterns.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.440
The military is building
killer geese?

17:50.486 --> 17:51.726
Shh!

17:55.283 --> 17:57.990
(IN LOW VOICE)
Camouflaged drones,

17:58.077 --> 17:59.863
heavily armed.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.697
Look up, see a goose.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.790
Don't pay any attention.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.459
Then, bangaroo!

18:10.715 --> 18:12.421
Death from above.

18:14.677 --> 18:18.169
Oldest rule of warfare,
control the high ground.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.380
Well,

18:22.226 --> 18:24.512
back to the lab
with this one.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.064
(IMITATING BIRD CALL)

18:36.115 --> 18:37.776
HENRY: Wait, you think
we're under attack?

18:37.867 --> 18:40.779
Well, isn't it possible
that someone is making
the space junk fall on Eureka?

18:40.870 --> 18:43.031
I mean, it's the oldest
rule of warfare
to control the high ground.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.241
Well, there have been
attempts at weaponizing
space debris,

18:45.291 --> 18:47.782
but Russia stopped after
the Cold War,
so that just leaves...

18:47.877 --> 18:48.912
Aliens?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.701
No, Jack. Us.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.127
Or aliens.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.249
The Star Wars defense system.
Now, they weren't working on

18:56.344 --> 18:59.507
rail guns and x-ray
lasers to shoot
down nuclear missiles.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.592
No, they wanted to use
what was up there
already as ammo.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.760
So, we tested a system
of magnetic panels
in the desert in 1986.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.812
And then we abandoned it
after our very first attempt.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.522
I'm hoping you didn't
suck down a bunch of
planes and helicopters.

19:12.610 --> 19:16.944
No, but nearly
all the recorded data
in Nevada was erased.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.356
Tapes in video stores,
floppy disks in casinos,

19:20.451 --> 19:22.942
half the database
of Area 51.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.488
Area 51 is real?

19:27.875 --> 19:29.285
No.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.953
Anyway, the research
was shuttered by 1989.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.667
It was too bad.
G.D. was heavily involved.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.758
Even some of our science fair
winners were in the mix.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.591
Stop it. Go back.
The one before.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.593
Okay.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.343
That's Finn.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.764
Huh.

19:49.814 --> 19:53.477
Aaron Finn won the
Eureka Science Fair

19:53.609 --> 19:58.774
in 1986 and received
a internship at Global for...

19:58.864 --> 20:02.106
Let me guess,
his work on giant,
space-junk-sucking magnets.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.609
Optical aiming devices

20:04.662 --> 20:08.371

space-junk-sucking magnets.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.614
Thanks, Henry.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.661
You're welcome.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.330
(SIGHING)

20:14.463 --> 20:15.839
Dr. Finn?

20:15.965 --> 20:17.000
What?

20:17.133 --> 20:19.920
Congratulations on the
science fair win.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.501
Well, that was
20 years ago, but okay.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.636
Is it a coincidence
that the project
that launched your career

20:27.768 --> 20:30.430
could actually explain
what's been happening?

20:31.689 --> 20:33.270
Launched my career?

20:33.983 --> 20:37.100
That science fair
nearly ended it before
it even began.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.611
Do you know what it is like
to have your best idea

20:40.614 --> 20:43.447
co-opted by the government
at age 16?

20:44.535 --> 20:46.617
No. Not really.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.486
It was all downhill
from there.

20:49.623 --> 20:53.286
20 years later,
where am I?
I'm not in Hawaii.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.125
I'm here.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.829
I'm a... I'm a...

20:57.965 --> 20:59.705
I'm a cameraman
to the stars.

21:01.927 --> 21:05.545
Sir, are you using
your research to get
back at the town?

21:08.142 --> 21:10.724
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to help the town.

21:10.811 --> 21:14.144
Look, I reprogrammed
the imager to take a real-time
assessment of the debris field

21:14.190 --> 21:17.728
every 20 minutes.
Look, I may be pissed off,

21:17.943 --> 21:20.855
but I could no more
cause this than
I could prevent it.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.489
Look, Sheriff!

21:27.203 --> 21:29.159
They're flying!

21:29.663 --> 21:31.324
Oh, congratulations.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.952
My geese, they're going.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.408
They're really going.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.249
Taggaﬂ?
Oh, they're turning.

21:39.340 --> 21:43.253
They seem to be
coming this way,
quite rapidly, actually.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.885
CARTER: Move! Move,
through here!

21:46.972 --> 21:48.963
Quick!
Hurry!

21:56.148 --> 22:00.016
Sorry about all this, Taggart.
Try not to take it
too personally.

22:00.110 --> 22:03.819
Well, it's difficult.
They lost their way,
and I gotta wear it!

22:04.740 --> 22:07.106
Taggart, do you think
that the same thing
that's screwing up your birds

22:07.159 --> 22:08.990
could be attracting
the space junk?

22:09.078 --> 22:12.115
They're made from
pure polymer matrix
composites, no metal.

22:12.248 --> 22:16.116
Yeah, but you said
you put some kind of compass
inside the birds, right?

22:16.502 --> 22:17.787
I gotcha.

22:19.129 --> 22:22.121
In your biological avian,
neurons contain an

22:22.258 --> 22:24.624
iron oxide crystal
that aligns with
magnetic north.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.751
It sends directional
info to the brain.

22:26.804 --> 22:29.887
I just designed
an artificial version
for my geese.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.093
Okay, so a big magnet
could knock them off course?

22:32.226 --> 22:33.807
Very possible.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.769
For the last time,
it's a camera.

have flown. I'm screwed.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.381
75th Ranger
Regiment motto.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.637
It means "to act
without warning."

23:54.934 --> 23:57.220
You know, they expect
you to give up.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.227
So, surprise them.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.937
Don't get mad, get even.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.352
Hmm.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.571
SARAH: We 're three minutes
from the Tesla School,
Sheriff.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.197
Yeah, I know.
Thanks.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.570
Can't afford a whole car?

24:14.620 --> 24:16.451
Oh, don't get me started.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.367
You okay?

24:20.042 --> 24:21.202
Yeah.

24:22.628 --> 24:26.746
It's just...
Took years of therapy to

24:26.799 --> 24:30.462
get over winning
that science fair,
and I haven't been back since.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.256
Get over it?

24:33.305 --> 24:34.590
Get over what? You won.

24:34.682 --> 24:38.015
You said it was
the high point of
your career.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.769
It was. The high point.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.934
And now I get to go back
and see how far I've fallen?

24:45.275 --> 24:46.856
Can't wait for that.

24:51.407 --> 24:55.025
I'm integrating the existing
processor circuitry fiber-ware

24:55.119 --> 24:59.613
with biomechanics interface
protocol, leading to possible
cybernetic applications.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.823
Your thoughts,
Dr. Stark?

25:02.459 --> 25:05.166
I was actually thinking
of a Bear Bryant quote.

25:05.963 --> 25:09.126
"Potential is what
you ain't got yet."

25:10.300 --> 25:12.791
Claude, do you even want
to be a scientist?

25:13.721 --> 25:16.929
You should quit
wasting everyone's time.
Step up your game.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.806
See what I mean?
Brutal.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.308
Yeah, I thought Stark
just talked like that to me.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.349
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

25:25.107 --> 25:26.267
So, what's behind the tent?

25:26.316 --> 25:29.023
Dr. Stark,
Principal Wallace,
we present

25:29.111 --> 25:32.353
solar-powered,
ultra-high resolution
gamma pulse tomography.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.479
It's the next phase
in medical imaging.

25:34.616 --> 25:38.700
First, there were
x-rays, then MRIs,
and now, the SGT.

25:38.787 --> 25:39.822
Tina.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.365
(CONTROLLER BEEPS)

25:41.790 --> 25:46.955
The SGT will lead us into
a cancer-free future, with an
entirely green power source.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.626
(MACHINE HUMMING)

25:52.801 --> 25:54.883
Hey, who threw that?

25:56.805 --> 25:58.670
This isn't supposed to happen.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.766
TINA: Make it stop!

26:07.816 --> 26:08.805
Bingo.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.354
I knew those three
were trouble.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.270
Looks like we found
our magnetic field.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.940
Stay back! How do I
shut this thing down?

26:17.993 --> 26:19.858
MEGAN: I don't know how.

26:26.376 --> 26:27.832
Oh!

26:28.378 --> 26:30.164
What is
happening here?

26:30.881 --> 26:34.089
Reno 111
just totally messed up
the future of medicine.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.508
We're gonna have to
take this in for testing.
And you, you and you,

26:36.595 --> 26:38.506
I'm gonna have to
ask you some questions.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.339
Wait, just...
It wasn't their fault.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.969
No one's getting
blamed yet, honey.

26:43.018 --> 26:46.260
No, look, whatever happened,
they didn't do it.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.184
It was me.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.026
MEGAN: Look what you've done!

26:58.117 --> 26:59.948
Easy. What did you do?

26:59.993 --> 27:02.826
I sua sponted them.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.570
You...

27:04.623 --> 27:10.459
She got even.
They sabotaged her experiment,
so she messed with theirs.

27:11.421 --> 27:12.456
Really?

27:12.506 --> 27:15.248
Yeah, I know.
Dumb, right?
Big surprise.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.336
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

27:17.427 --> 27:19.463
I over-cranked the
system when you were
gone for lunch.

27:19.513 --> 27:22.425
It's not like your
wiring was that
hard to re-circuit.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.305
You better not
have touched
the power system.

27:24.393 --> 27:26.725
Enough. We're not done.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.097
If you messed
with this thing at lunch,

27:28.230 --> 27:31.267
then there's no way it could
have pulled the space junk
down on my Jeep this morning.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.227
Thanks for
breaking it, then.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.227
So does that mean
I'm not grounded?

27:36.572 --> 27:39.814
You're more than
grounded. We just have
bigger problems right now.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.950
Finn's boss took a
reading from the G.D.
radioscope in Haleakala.

27:43.996 --> 27:47.989
He gives us three hours before
the debris field enters
the atmosphere above Eureka.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.415
Most of the small particles
will burn upon entry.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.246
Well, how about
the big ones?
Will make it through

27:52.296 --> 27:53.581
and we have no idea
where they'll hit.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.131
All right, well,
whoever's here
stays here.

27:55.174 --> 27:58.291
The rest are being moved
to underground bunkers,
but I don't even want to think

27:58.343 --> 28:00.629
about what's gonna
happen to the town.

28:01.763 --> 28:04.379
I don't know why it went
all Magneto in there.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.094
Why don't you ask
the dumb blonde
who messed with it?

28:07.144 --> 28:09.100
Watch who you're
calling "dumb."

28:09.354 --> 28:11.015
I've seen this before.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.607
Ten minutes ago
at the science fair?

28:12.649 --> 28:15.391
No, on the roof
of Global, only bigger.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.521
What are you talking about?

28:17.613 --> 28:19.604
Megan, I admire
your audacity.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.781
But the rules prohibit
the use of any technology
from Global.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.200
I didn't steal it.
I invented it.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.949
Jane Harrington
developed an identical
solar beam array

28:27.998 --> 28:29.954
to power our
new security system.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.037
Do you really expect us
to believe that this is
just coincidence?

28:33.128 --> 28:34.743
Jane Harrington?

28:35.255 --> 28:36.916
I take it you know her?

28:38.383 --> 28:40.123
Yeah.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.047
She's my mom.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.930
MAN ON P.A.:
Evacuation in progress.

28:48.936 --> 28:50.927
Please continue
down to the bunkers.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.428
(BEEPING)

29:01.365 --> 29:03.276
Hey, Jane,
what you doing?

29:03.450 --> 29:05.736
(SIGHING) Some sort
of bird problem

29:05.786 --> 29:08.027
damaged my system's
power source on the roof.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.116
We're having to scan
everyone manually.

29:10.207 --> 29:13.745
Are you good, or should
we get your daughter
to help you fix it?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.289
Megan?

29:18.632 --> 29:21.590
You stole her design
to help power
your security system.

29:21.635 --> 29:24.422
(SCOFFING) I invented
that power system.

29:24.471 --> 29:26.883
Why would I have to steal it
from a 15-year-old?

29:26.974 --> 29:29.215
Oh, maybe because
you've been
behind schedule.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.133
Now, suddenly,
you're online.

29:31.728 --> 29:34.765
I checked the dates
on your plans
against Megan's project.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.437
We know what happened.

29:39.069 --> 29:40.684
Does Megan know?

29:40.779 --> 29:42.610
Jane, how could
you do that?

29:42.781 --> 29:44.191
You're a parent.

29:44.533 --> 29:47.570
You know the pressure
to do what's best
for your child.

29:47.953 --> 29:50.945
Megan loves it in Eureka.
Ifl didn't get
this system working,

29:51.039 --> 29:53.530
my funding would be cut.
I'd be out.

29:53.709 --> 29:54.915
I panicked.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.296
I'm so embarrassed.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.917
I'm sorry, but I'll
have to suspend
your clearance

30:00.966 --> 30:03.127
pending review
by the ethics panel.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.095
I just didn't want
to let her down.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.014
Guys, I've got something
you need to see.

30:22.029 --> 30:23.894
FINN: Yeah, it's coming,
all of it.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.187
I thought we had
more time.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.943
This doesn't make
any sense.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.525
I don't care how big
you make my experiment,

30:29.619 --> 30:32.031
the power supply doesn't have
anything to do with magnets.

30:32.122 --> 30:33.612
CARTER: Well, maybe it's
interacting with something?

30:33.707 --> 30:34.742
Oh.

30:35.417 --> 30:36.577
Good "0h"? Bad "oh"?

30:36.626 --> 30:38.207
The EM barrier over Global,

30:38.295 --> 30:40.786
it's an electromagnetic
security umbrella.

30:40.881 --> 30:44.044
You shot my energy beam
through a magneto
static array?

30:44.468 --> 30:46.800
Mom, duh!

30:47.220 --> 30:49.597
The beam turned the shield
into a giant magnet

30:49.639 --> 30:52.472
strong enough to pull
metal down from space.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.605
You've got to
turn off the beam.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.353
Section Four, please.

31:02.611 --> 31:05.023
The beam's been off
since the bird issue.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.276
The debris is already
in the atmosphere.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.781
JANE: I'm afraid
it's too late.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.364
(CRASHING)

31:19.836 --> 31:22.043
(CRASHING)

31:22.798 --> 31:24.959
JO: Everybody, stay calm.

31:25.008 --> 31:27.875
The safest place in town
is right here.

31:29.304 --> 31:33.513
Well, we got everyone in the
auditorium and the deputy
has yet to use her Taser.

31:33.642 --> 31:36.884
Thank God for small favors.
ls Kevin okay? Is he scared?

31:36.978 --> 31:38.229
He's good. He's safe.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.269
I told him he could be
an honoraryjudge.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.018
I should be there with him.

31:42.109 --> 31:46.102
You will be soon enough.
Just concentrate on trying
to stop this debris.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.107
(CRASHING)

31:48.615 --> 31:49.775
Nathan?

31:49.783 --> 31:50.989
Still ﬁne.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.699
But I guess I got my answer.

31:52.786 --> 31:54.117
Yeah.

31:54.788 --> 31:57.370
HENRY: The debris is
entering the atmosphere
at a very steep angle.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.197
Can we un-steep it?

31:59.292 --> 32:02.159
Do you understand anything
about particle physics?

32:03.255 --> 32:04.836
No, not really.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.997
Well, how about gravity?

32:08.218 --> 32:13.554
Once my mom's security device
pulled the space junk out
of orbit, gravity takes over.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.514
(EXPLOSION)

32:18.019 --> 32:19.805
Not necessarily...

32:22.816 --> 32:25.728
There's a giant magnet under
this floor, and I figure,
if it can repel these bars,

32:25.819 --> 32:27.650
maybe it can do
the same thing to
the space junk.

32:27.737 --> 32:28.897
That's your idea?

32:28.989 --> 32:30.149
Megan, don't be rude.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.610
You don't get to tell me
what to do, not anymore.

32:32.659 --> 32:33.899
I may have let
the pressure get to me,

32:33.994 --> 32:35.859
I may have made a mistake,
but I'm still your mother

32:35.954 --> 32:37.615
and you don't get to talk
to people that way.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.827
Jack, this field is simply
not powerful enough
to push the debris away.

32:40.876 --> 32:44.915
Oh, I'm not talking about
pushing it away.
I'm talking, more nudging it.

32:45.422 --> 32:48.459
Oh, you mean,
alter the angle
of entry just enough

32:48.508 --> 32:51.341
so that the debris
will burn up in
the atmosphere?

32:51.511 --> 32:53.422
Uh... Sure. Okay.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.963
Dad, that's...
That's almost brilliant.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.005
We'd still need morejuice.

32:57.142 --> 33:00.100
Yeah, but Zoe supercharged
Megan's power source
at the science fair.

33:00.187 --> 33:02.473
So, then, we just hook it up
to the giant magnet
under the floor, here.

33:02.606 --> 33:04.221
And then,
there's ourjuice.

33:04.274 --> 33:05.389
Zoe?

33:05.442 --> 33:06.898
I don't know how to do that.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.604
Sure you do.
You just did it.

33:08.737 --> 33:12.571
I was just screwing around.
You can't possibly expect me
to fix this by myself.

33:12.616 --> 33:13.947
Seriously.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.658
No. I don't.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.951
That's why both
of you are here.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.412
HENRY: The bulk of
the debris field is
only 15 minutes away.

33:21.458 --> 33:22.948
We gotta hurry.

33:24.127 --> 33:27.665
Okay, Zoe, think.
You boosted Megan's power.
What did you do?

33:27.923 --> 33:29.584
I...
She has no idea
what she did.

33:29.633 --> 33:33.125
She's like that one monkey
who just happens
to type Shakespeare.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.756
Okay, well, you know,
even a trained monkey
would know that the peak

33:35.805 --> 33:37.796
output of a PV array
can be increased
dramatically

33:37.849 --> 33:39.805
if the modules are
interconnected in parallel,

33:39.851 --> 33:41.967
not in series,
as was done here.

33:42.145 --> 33:45.763
That could increase
our efficiency 400%.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.650
Good job, sweetie.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.438
Do whatever you want,
if you think she
knows so much.

33:50.570 --> 33:51.901
Megan...
Enough.

33:52.948 --> 33:57.112
Look, this is not about
who knows more
or who's the smartest.

33:57.994 --> 34:01.236
Forget the competition.
Forget the pressure,
it is crap.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.117
Look, you have created
something amazing,

34:03.166 --> 34:05.873
and now you have a chance
to make a difference.

34:07.587 --> 34:11.671
Don't let anything
get in the way of that, or
believe me, you'll regret it.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.050
Okay.

34:17.430 --> 34:20.467
We still need a SatNav
system to orient
the magnetic field accurately.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.517
Now, I could rig something up,
but that'll take time.

34:24.688 --> 34:27.179
You don't have to.
I know where one is.

34:29.526 --> 34:30.641
Is this gonna work?

34:30.735 --> 34:33.192
I hope so,
because the circuitry
is gonna be fried.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.521
The energy sap
is catastrophic.

34:36.032 --> 34:38.409
SARAH: Guess this means
we're not going to the beach.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.988
No, we won't, but it's been
quite an adventure.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.785
Okay.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.328
Okay, SARAH, what do you see?

34:52.299 --> 34:54.631
Processing trajectory data.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.467
Power's holding steady.
Good work, girls.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.635
Not bad, for a norm.

34:59.973 --> 35:03.136
Wow, that's the most
human thing you've ever
said to me.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.883
Don't tell anyone.

35:06.062 --> 35:08.223
Here we go.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.853
The data stream is
too large for my processor.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.438
I’m running low
on available memory.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.398
HENRY: We've only
got 30 seconds

35:16.448 --> 35:18.939
until the debris field
enters the atmosphere.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.945
Still calculating trajectory.

35:21.036 --> 35:24.199
CARTER: Come on, SARAH,
you can do it.
I know you can.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.288
Trajectory found.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.589
CARTER: Henry, what's
going on? Is it working?

35:41.222 --> 35:45.465
Space debris vertical
trajectory has been
adjusted by 32 degrees.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.725
It's working.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.227
Debris ﬁeld beginning
to vaporize.

35:53.276 --> 35:54.265
Yes!

35:56.196 --> 35:57.436
Great. Good job.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.519
You, too.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.286
SARAH?

36:07.707 --> 36:11.120
(VOICE SLOW/NG)
Quite an adventure.
See you at home.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.802
It is said,

36:19.844 --> 36:23.962
an inventor is a person
who makes an ingenious
arrangement of wheels,

36:24.474 --> 36:28.808
levers and springs,
and believes
it’s civilization.

36:29.979 --> 36:34.393
One student's invention
may have, indeed,
saved civilization.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.394
Or, at least, Eureka.

36:36.486 --> 36:41.526
Tesla School's science
fair has named this
year's ﬁrst prize,

36:41.950 --> 36:46.284
and a one-year internship at
Global Dynamics,

36:48.164 --> 36:49.540
Megan Harrington.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.131
You were robbed.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.295
Yeah, an internship?

36:58.383 --> 37:00.214
Please.
Totally dodged that bullet.

37:00.301 --> 37:05.512
It is also said that
the path to civilization
is paved not with individuals,

37:05.515 --> 37:06.721
It is also said that
the path to civilization
is paved not with individuals,

37:07.308 --> 37:08.889
but with partnerships.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.600
Second place
goes to Zoe Carter.

37:11.855 --> 37:13.186
(GASPING) What?

37:13.231 --> 37:15.062
And her prize is a new car.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.104
A new car?

37:28.663 --> 37:30.779
Hey, Henry.

37:30.832 --> 37:33.323
The debris is burning
up in the atmosphere.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.702
Still pretty, though.

37:37.046 --> 37:38.707
Got any wishes?

37:39.007 --> 37:40.167
One.

37:47.682 --> 37:50.014
Nathan, I know
you blame yourself
for what happened to Kim.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.012
Don't. It wasn't your fault.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.223
Wish I could be
certain of that.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.354
I am.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.354
MEGAN: Dr. Finn?

38:01.780 --> 38:04.442
There she is,
the girl of the hour.

38:05.241 --> 38:06.572
Congratulations.

38:06.618 --> 38:10.611
Thanks. They told me
that I get to choose
what project I want to work on

38:10.663 --> 38:12.449
for the internship.

38:13.082 --> 38:14.913
It's a big move.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.498
Be sure you pick something
you're passionate about.

38:19.589 --> 38:22.797
And good people,
people you can trust.

38:23.802 --> 38:27.420
That's why I was
thinking I might like
to work with you,

38:27.931 --> 38:29.592
if that's okay.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.761
Yeah, it would be an honor.

38:36.356 --> 38:39.473
But, if you steal
any of my ideas,
I will bury you.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.109
I'm kidding.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.436
I'm just kidding.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.278
Saying goodbye?

38:50.578 --> 38:53.411
Time to let them
find their own way
in the world.

38:54.916 --> 38:58.625
That's got to be easier
without a giant magnet
pulling them off course.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.456
At least it wasn't
your fault.

39:00.588 --> 39:01.964
Actually, it was.

39:02.966 --> 39:05.207
I was wondering
why none of the biological
birds around town

39:05.301 --> 39:07.462
had the same
navigational problems.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.920
Turns out,
when I built my babies,

39:11.641 --> 39:13.802
I made the
compasses too sensitive.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.726
Wanted to be sure
they'd never get lost.

39:16.813 --> 39:18.974
At least your heart
was in the right place.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.435
Nah, I should have
trusted them more.

39:22.151 --> 39:26.611
They're gonna get lost,
sure, lose their bearings
for a bit.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.939
That's how they'll learn.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.738
Yeah.

39:34.831 --> 39:36.571
It's a little
bit depressing.

39:46.301 --> 39:47.461
Hi, sweetie.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.966
Hi.

39:57.520 --> 40:00.136
You're not gonna let me
keep the car, are you?

40:01.691 --> 40:03.556
Yeah, you can keep it.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.984
Just wanted to
make sure you
were ready.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.686
I am, really.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.362
I know you are.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.451
Not sure if! am.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.618
Did you see Taggart's geese?

40:15.747 --> 40:20.867
Apparently, dads aren't
very well equipped for this
child-rearing thing.

40:22.378 --> 40:25.120
Oh, I don't know.
You do all right.

40:28.635 --> 40:32.093
Oh, I looked
up 111, and...

40:33.723 --> 40:35.213
Average.

40:35.892 --> 40:38.178
Exactly average.

40:38.645 --> 40:40.636
So I guess I'm not as smart
as I thought I was.

40:40.688 --> 40:43.270
Hey, we're Carters.
We're street-smart.

40:44.651 --> 40:48.690
Who cares, anyway?
Honestly, I wish I had never
even taken the stupid test.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.315
Really?

40:50.406 --> 40:51.566
Yeah.

40:51.658 --> 40:54.365
'Cause I got your
results from Principal
Wallace, tonight.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.319
And I thought you might
want to open them.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.278
But, just...

40:59.624 --> 41:02.206
I love you,
whatever your IQ is.

41:11.386 --> 41:12.796
112!

41:12.971 --> 41:16.134
That's great.
You did... You did
your dad one better!
