00:33.286 --> 00:35.454
APF, open up, please.

00:42.503 --> 00:44.713
APF, open up, now!

00:52.722 --> 00:54.474
Please help!

00:56.268 --> 00:57.894
Anne Masu Kowtok?

00:58.395 --> 01:00.771
- Yeah?
- You're under arrest for trespassing

01:00.771 --> 01:04.568
and the destruction of private property
at the Silver Sky Mining facilities.

01:04.568 --> 01:06.027
Turn around
and hands behind your head.

01:06.027 --> 01:07.820
- I'm gonna need a minute.
- Ma'am.

01:09.406 --> 01:11.450
Ma'am, I said turn around
and hands behind your head.

01:11.450 --> 01:15.244
She's 10 centimeters dilated.
Contractions every two minutes.

01:15.244 --> 01:17.539
Shoot me,
but I'm getting that baby out of her.

01:18.623 --> 01:20.876
Is this a clinic?

01:21.585 --> 01:25.213
It's a birthing center.
The last one in the region.

01:25.922 --> 01:28.090
Do you wanna arrest me for that too?

01:33.472 --> 01:35.014
Grace, Grace.

01:38.477 --> 01:39.603
Okay?

01:39.603 --> 01:42.063
What's that bitch doing here?

01:44.065 --> 01:47.277
She's helping. Bring hot water.

01:48.278 --> 01:50.238
Grace, Grace. Breathe, breathe.

01:54.201 --> 01:57.329
Okay? Breathe, breathe.
Take some deep breaths.

01:57.329 --> 01:59.456
Deep breaths, okay?

02:02.834 --> 02:05.212
- Put the water in.
- You're doing good. You're doing great.

02:05.837 --> 02:07.798
Deep breath, deep breath.

02:09.382 --> 02:14.096
Grace, Grace.
On the next big one, you push, okay?

02:14.096 --> 02:17.808
Give it a really good push, okay?

02:23.146 --> 02:25.732
- Okay, give me a good push.
- Push.

02:27.901 --> 02:28.902
Push!

02:30.320 --> 02:31.530
Push!

02:32.614 --> 02:34.825
It's here, it's here.
Okay, okay.

02:41.373 --> 02:43.583
It's a little baby girl, Grace!

02:46.420 --> 02:48.046
My baby.

02:49.005 --> 02:51.049
I wanna hold my baby.

02:51.591 --> 02:55.429
- I wanna see her.
- Takes a few minutes sometimes, Grace.

02:58.515 --> 03:00.434
Give me that.

03:00.434 --> 03:02.978
Why isn't she, why isn't she crying?

03:02.978 --> 03:06.022
- She'll be fine.
- It's okay. It's okay.

03:06.022 --> 03:08.358
But she's not crying!

03:08.358 --> 03:11.445
- Annie, why isn't she crying?
- She's coming. She's coming.

03:11.445 --> 03:14.948
- Annie!
- We have to do CPR.

03:14.948 --> 03:16.616
Annie, I wanna hold her!

03:16.616 --> 03:18.160
- Okay, come on.
- One, two, three.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.369
What's happening?

03:20.912 --> 03:24.958
What's happening? Please! Please!

04:00.994 --> 04:03.121
You take her from here, okay?

04:19.179 --> 04:20.806
Now we can go.

04:44.246 --> 04:46.415
Here we go. Hey, hey.

04:46.415 --> 04:47.624
Hey, Paulie!

04:48.625 --> 04:51.962
Alright. Lookin' good here.
Yeah, yeah, Scotty.

04:51.962 --> 04:54.214
Gotta lock and load. Lock and load, buddy.

04:54.214 --> 04:56.883
What's up, Paulie?
Bringin' out the big guns, huh?

04:58.927 --> 05:00.303
What the fuck are you doing?

05:00.303 --> 05:03.557
This is a task op.
Your boys here are a liability.

05:04.099 --> 05:06.309
I'll take all the help I can get.

05:10.689 --> 05:12.983
Okay, everybody, gather around.

05:18.697 --> 05:20.699
Alright, listen up.

05:21.074 --> 05:26.538
Suspect is Raymond Clark,
5'11, brown hair, brown eyes.

05:26.538 --> 05:28.749
Last seen wearing a pink parka.

05:29.374 --> 05:31.585
Consider him armed and dangerous.

05:32.169 --> 05:36.339
He's got at least a 48-hour head start
on us, so we gotta move.

05:36.339 --> 05:37.966
We're gonna break into search groups.

05:38.467 --> 05:41.762
Agents Cooper and Lee
are in charge of sweeping the tundra.

05:41.762 --> 05:45.724
They'll proceed north together,
then fan out at three-mile intervals.

05:45.724 --> 05:48.977
Trooper Davis is gonna inspect
the mining dredges.

05:48.977 --> 05:50.854
Checkpoints go up at 15 miles.

05:50.854 --> 05:54.024
Radio chain maintained at all times.

05:54.024 --> 05:55.901
Now let's go get this fucker.

06:01.239 --> 06:03.658
Hey, we want him alive.

06:04.367 --> 06:05.577
Do we?

07:35.041 --> 07:37.461
Hank, this is Danvers, over.

07:38.462 --> 07:40.422
Hank, answer the fuckin' radio.

07:40.422 --> 07:42.466
Your father's recruiting civilians.

07:42.466 --> 07:43.842
- Hey, Lulu?
- Yeah?

07:43.842 --> 07:45.093
Will you get a trooper on the phone

07:45.093 --> 07:48.430
and have him get Hank
on his fuckin' radio?

07:48.430 --> 07:50.599
- Okay!
- Alright, where's my forensic technician?

07:50.599 --> 07:55.896
He's booked on the evening charter.
And Lund is still in a coma.

07:56.730 --> 07:58.648
They had to amputate both his legs.

07:58.648 --> 08:01.109
Still might lose his left forearm.

08:03.028 --> 08:04.029
I still need to talk to him.

08:04.488 --> 08:07.282
Yes, ma'am. And good luck with that.

08:07.282 --> 08:09.993
When's Clark's stuff
comin' from the trailer?

08:13.163 --> 08:15.373
What's Clark's shit
doin' in the evidence room?

08:16.124 --> 08:17.709
Well, it's evidence.

08:17.709 --> 08:19.836
Yeah, well, move it someplace sanitary.

08:20.545 --> 08:22.964
The place is disgusting. Stinks.

08:23.799 --> 08:28.011
Alright, I'm gonna need a tetanus shot
just to look at this shit.

08:28.762 --> 08:31.389
- How many boxes we got?
- Nineteen.

08:31.389 --> 08:33.475
Nineteen. Alright, well...

08:34.726 --> 08:36.144
call Navarro.

08:36.895 --> 08:41.775
Hit up her Trooper command and tell him
I'm requesting a transfer for her.

08:42.234 --> 08:43.985
Okay? Just temporarily.

08:43.985 --> 08:46.196
I thought you hated Navarro.

08:46.196 --> 08:48.490
I do. I hate everyone.

08:49.324 --> 08:53.912
Hate you, especially now.
Here. Annie K's cell.

08:53.912 --> 08:56.206
- Crack that, will ya?
- Crack it?

08:56.623 --> 08:58.291
- Yeah.
- I'm not a hacker.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.586
Well, you're under 30. You got friends.

09:02.212 --> 09:04.423
Why don't you just figure it out?

09:04.923 --> 09:06.925
Figure it out, yeah.

09:07.342 --> 09:08.343
What?

09:10.011 --> 09:11.012
What?

09:15.058 --> 09:16.476
Ask the question.

09:23.358 --> 09:25.986
What happened the last case you
worked with Navarro?

09:26.611 --> 09:28.238
The Wheeler case,

09:29.156 --> 09:31.366
'cause that was it for you guys, right?

09:35.120 --> 09:36.121
Alright.

09:38.290 --> 09:39.916
Only one bedtime story.

09:43.336 --> 09:45.338
It was a murder-suicide.

09:46.548 --> 09:48.175
William Wheeler.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.679
He was a bad, bad motherfucker.

09:53.764 --> 09:55.390
Sexual assault,

09:56.141 --> 09:57.517
armed robbery,

09:58.185 --> 09:59.811
assault and battery.

10:00.812 --> 10:02.647
He was in and out a bunch.

10:03.148 --> 10:04.775
The last time he came out,

10:05.650 --> 10:07.861
he took up with an 18-year-old girl.

10:08.612 --> 10:11.239
He beat her, hard.

10:12.824 --> 10:14.326
Sent her to the hospital,

10:14.993 --> 10:15.994
twice.

10:17.037 --> 10:18.455
Broken arm,

10:18.872 --> 10:20.749
smashed jaw,

10:21.666 --> 10:23.293
some other things.

10:23.752 --> 10:26.213
We went to his place a buncha times

10:26.963 --> 10:28.965
but she wouldn't report him.

10:30.258 --> 10:32.260
His story was always the same.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.930
"Ah, she was drunk, Officer."

10:35.430 --> 10:37.265
"Fell down the stairs, Officer."

10:38.809 --> 10:40.811
We knew how that was gonna end

10:41.937 --> 10:44.106
but there was nothin' we could do.

10:46.566 --> 10:48.193
Then we got the call.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.715
<i>We were too late.</i>

11:11.591 --> 11:12.801
<i>He killed her</i>

11:14.845 --> 11:16.638
<i>and he shot himself.</i>

11:33.989 --> 11:36.199
They were both dead when we got there.

11:38.994 --> 11:40.996
Navarro couldn't get over it.

11:41.496 --> 11:46.084
She was convinced that there was
somethin' we should've done.

11:46.710 --> 11:50.338
She blamed me, of course.
And it got nasty.

11:51.214 --> 11:53.633
Transferred over to Troopers and

11:56.136 --> 11:57.763
end of story.

11:59.347 --> 12:01.349
Gotta keep icin' that thing, huh?

12:03.185 --> 12:04.603
It's funny.

12:06.772 --> 12:11.068
League hockey champion
fallin' on his face in the ice rink.

12:12.027 --> 12:13.445
Alright, go on.

12:13.945 --> 12:15.781
Go get her. Go get Navarro.

12:24.081 --> 12:27.250
Go tell your dad to get rid of his
hillbilly friends

12:27.250 --> 12:30.253
or I'm gonna call immigration
on his Russian mail-order bride!

12:35.467 --> 12:37.427
No, nothing!
What about over there?

12:37.427 --> 12:39.304
Nothin', man!

13:00.242 --> 13:02.244
<i>Help us.</i>

13:20.846 --> 13:23.890
<i>Navarro. Calling Navarro.
Are you there, Navarro?</i>

13:23.890 --> 13:25.600
Navarro here.

13:38.989 --> 13:40.407
Let's do this.

14:40.383 --> 14:42.385
What are we missin' here?

14:47.849 --> 14:48.892
This.

14:49.476 --> 14:51.686
Spring 2016.

14:52.312 --> 14:54.689
They must've started their relationship
before then.

14:54.689 --> 14:56.400
Yeah, how do you know that?

14:56.900 --> 14:59.111
See that? Ariana Grande.

14:59.653 --> 15:02.864
That came out in May 2016.

15:02.864 --> 15:05.367
And Leah played it all the time.
Her birthday.

15:05.367 --> 15:07.285
Drove me nuts.

15:08.662 --> 15:11.289
And, alright, look at this.

15:11.873 --> 15:13.834
Here her hair's changing color.

15:13.834 --> 15:18.547
Here she's got the blue tint,
and now it's fading, see?

15:19.131 --> 15:20.382
That's a long time.

15:24.094 --> 15:26.721
I mean, she looks happy.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.437
They look happy.

15:36.940 --> 15:38.275
This

15:38.984 --> 15:41.820
hot, fun girl

15:42.821 --> 15:44.823
and this total weirdo.

15:47.492 --> 15:48.702
Yeah.

15:49.786 --> 15:53.665
No one sees 'em together.
A secret affair.

15:54.583 --> 15:56.376
Ask the question.

15:56.376 --> 15:57.961
Fuck your games.

15:57.961 --> 16:00.255
Come on, ask the question.

16:03.842 --> 16:05.844
Why keep it a secret?

16:12.934 --> 16:15.812
Are you still fuckin' that dog runner
bootlegging guy, Qavvik?

16:15.812 --> 16:19.107
- Or are you back with girls?
- You still fucking C--

16:20.442 --> 16:22.444
Anything that can't run fast enough?

16:23.695 --> 16:25.113
What, freshman?

16:28.241 --> 16:30.535
Hey, yo, freshman,
you better learn how to run faster.

16:30.535 --> 16:31.620
Hey.

16:33.663 --> 16:35.957
Nobody here knows about Ted, alright?

16:37.834 --> 16:38.960
Come on, Liz.

16:40.295 --> 16:42.047
Everybody knows.

16:45.050 --> 16:46.843
Well, you think nobody knew
about their relationship?

16:46.843 --> 16:49.054
Nobody knew they were together?

16:49.054 --> 16:50.555
- Nobody.
- Alright.

16:52.808 --> 16:54.017
Look at this.

16:56.228 --> 16:59.064
Everything else is selfie or timed.

17:01.691 --> 17:03.693
That's a candid photo.

17:04.486 --> 17:06.696
Somebody was there with them that day.

17:08.740 --> 17:10.909
There has to be more like this one.

17:13.370 --> 17:14.371
Yep.

17:22.546 --> 17:25.173
See that?
Ya think that's her hair dye?

17:26.258 --> 17:27.676
It's not a print.

17:31.012 --> 17:33.014
Yeah, we don't need a print.

17:40.313 --> 17:42.315
Hey, I'm gonna be another 20!

17:50.490 --> 17:51.992
Hi, Susan.

17:55.954 --> 17:59.249
What was that color
you used on Annie's hair?

18:01.835 --> 18:03.545
Ah, right here.

18:06.256 --> 18:08.884
Electric Blue, wasn't it?

18:10.469 --> 18:12.304
You lied to me.

18:14.681 --> 18:16.683
<i>Yeah, I knew Ray.</i>

18:17.976 --> 18:19.811
And you just decided not to tell me.

18:20.771 --> 18:24.357
- Your friend was dead.
- Yeah, 32 stabs.

18:24.357 --> 18:26.026
It's a pretty clear message.

18:26.026 --> 18:27.736
Mommy?

18:34.076 --> 18:36.036
Mac and cheese.

18:37.496 --> 18:39.039
You got any mac and cheese?

18:39.998 --> 18:42.542
- Yeah. It's in the...
- Yeah, I'll find it.

18:42.542 --> 18:46.797
Hey, do you know what the name
of that unicorn is on your sweater?

18:46.797 --> 18:48.507
That's Puddles.

18:48.507 --> 18:50.592
That's what they called her
'cause she cried a lot.

18:51.343 --> 18:55.263
All the mean unicorns called her that
but she was just super hungry. Come on.

18:55.263 --> 18:57.432
- It's okay.
- We're gonna go make some mac and cheese.

18:57.432 --> 18:58.767
- Does that sound good?
- Yeah.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.685
I'ma tell you all about Puddles.

19:01.394 --> 19:04.231
All her story about how
she cooks mac and cheese.

19:05.273 --> 19:07.901
- Here, sit down on this.
- Okay.

19:11.571 --> 19:13.407
You need to start talkin'.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.831
I went to Tsalal to give haircuts
to the men there.

19:21.456 --> 19:23.542
Annie came with me one time.

19:24.418 --> 19:25.419
Once.

19:26.586 --> 19:28.880
I didn't wanna bring her.
She wouldn't take a no.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.925
She was, like, obsessed with coming.

19:31.925 --> 19:35.011
So, fuck it,
I could use the company.

19:35.804 --> 19:38.098
And what happened that one time?

19:38.098 --> 19:39.766
Annie and Ray hit it off.

19:39.766 --> 19:42.894
They talked all night.
She showed him her tattoo.

19:42.894 --> 19:45.397
He was, like, fixated on it.

19:54.823 --> 19:56.199
This one?

19:56.199 --> 19:57.909
Yeah, that's it.

19:59.077 --> 20:02.122
- Do you know what it means?
- She dreamt it.

20:02.122 --> 20:05.792
We were in high school. A buncha times.

20:06.334 --> 20:07.878
She got the tattoo, the dreams stopped.

20:09.421 --> 20:10.839
<i>Alright. Stir, stir, stir.</i>

20:11.590 --> 20:16.261
And then, all the unicorns
went skating on the lake

20:16.261 --> 20:19.306
that Puddles had made
with her rainbow tears.

20:20.098 --> 20:22.017
I love skating.

20:26.021 --> 20:27.731
I thought it was gonna be
a one-night thing.

20:28.398 --> 20:30.192
Pretty soon, they were
hangin' out all the time.

20:30.192 --> 20:33.904
And what about Clark?
Was he violent?

20:34.529 --> 20:37.908
Anything to make you think he might
do something?

20:37.908 --> 20:40.410
No. He was quiet.

20:41.453 --> 20:44.915
I mean, he was a little weird,
but he was crazy about her.

20:44.915 --> 20:47.626
But Annie changed when
they started goin' out.

20:48.627 --> 20:50.003
Changed how?

20:50.003 --> 20:53.006
She didn't want anybody to know
they were together.

20:53.006 --> 20:54.841
And that was weird.

20:58.595 --> 21:00.347
You could've told me back then.

21:01.098 --> 21:02.933
I would've protected you.

21:03.683 --> 21:04.976
I was terrified.

21:04.976 --> 21:07.687
Plus, I was seeing a guy from Tsalal.

21:07.687 --> 21:09.606
Wait, who?

21:10.524 --> 21:11.942
Oliver Tagaq.

21:13.485 --> 21:16.905
Oh, there's no Oliver
that works at Tsalal.

21:17.531 --> 21:18.865
He was the equipment engineer.

21:18.865 --> 21:20.742
He left right before Annie died.

21:22.744 --> 21:23.870
And

21:24.538 --> 21:26.498
do you know where we
could find this Oliver?

21:26.957 --> 21:29.167
Last I heard,
somewhere out on the ice.

21:29.626 --> 21:33.630
Probably hunting.
I don't think he's lookin' to be found.

21:41.179 --> 21:43.598
After they found her,
I did call the police.

21:45.183 --> 21:47.227
I just didn't wanna talk to you 'cause
you'da known me.

21:47.227 --> 21:49.563
So I didn't leave my name.

21:49.563 --> 21:51.565
But I told 'em about Clark.

21:52.357 --> 21:53.984
Who'd you talk to?

21:56.236 --> 21:57.821
<i>Prior, where's your dad?
Over.</i>

21:57.821 --> 21:59.781
<i>He's still out in the search, Chief.</i>

21:59.781 --> 22:02.159
There's plenty of radio signal out there,
he's hidin' his ass.

22:02.159 --> 22:03.910
<i>I'll get him to call
the minute he gets back.</i>

22:03.910 --> 22:07.581
Yeah, okay, you do that,
and see if you can find an Oliver Tagaq.

22:07.581 --> 22:10.208
He was an engineer
six years ago at Tsalal.

22:10.208 --> 22:12.294
- Got that?
- <i>On it, over.</i>

22:14.254 --> 22:19.634
That son of a bitch takes me off the case
and then he buries this lead?

22:19.634 --> 22:22.846
- Question is, why is Hank fuckin' around--
- Don't "Ask the question" me!

22:22.846 --> 22:26.057
Okay?
I'll tell you why he did it right now.

22:26.057 --> 22:28.143
It's the fucking mine behind it.

22:29.686 --> 22:31.271
You know I'm right.

22:31.271 --> 22:33.315
- I don't know shit.
- Well, then you're a shit detective.

22:33.315 --> 22:35.984
Yeah, well, whatever. Whatever you say.

22:37.319 --> 22:40.447
Annie protests against the mine,
Annie gets murdered,

22:40.447 --> 22:42.616
the police shush it all,
do the fucking math.

22:42.616 --> 22:44.201
You do the fuckin' math.

22:44.201 --> 22:46.661
Alright, without the mine,
there's no town.

22:46.661 --> 22:48.288
50% of the population works for it,

22:48.288 --> 22:51.708
which means half the people
who live here

22:51.708 --> 22:53.835
have got a reason to silence Annie K.

22:55.128 --> 22:57.464
And what about Clark, creepy boyfriend?

22:58.131 --> 23:00.759
What, you think the mine's responsible
for him too?

23:02.219 --> 23:04.012
According to your conspiracy theory,

23:04.012 --> 23:07.099
Tsalal and Clark
had nothin' to do with it.

23:07.099 --> 23:08.183
Is that it?

23:10.727 --> 23:11.937
Not sure yet.

23:12.395 --> 23:13.772
And what about her tongue?

23:13.772 --> 23:15.899
Now, what's your explanation
for her tongue

23:15.899 --> 23:17.609
poppin' up six years after she dies?

23:17.609 --> 23:20.237
And what about the men on the ice?
Why'd they go out there?

23:26.368 --> 23:33.333
Come on.
Don't give me that voodoo, E.T., cosmic

23:33.333 --> 23:35.377
choompa-loompa bullshit.

23:35.377 --> 23:37.254
Are you tryna say "chupacabra"?

23:37.254 --> 23:40.841
Whatever, the magic. It's no magic.

23:40.841 --> 23:43.385
Alright, there's a real
explanation for this.

23:45.470 --> 23:46.471
Alright.

23:47.681 --> 23:48.849
I'm listening.

23:48.849 --> 23:51.309
We're just not askin' the right questions.

23:52.310 --> 23:54.688
We will. We'll find it.

23:54.688 --> 23:57.399
Who's the one that believes in miracles?

24:00.569 --> 24:02.028
Fantasy Football?

24:02.654 --> 24:04.281
No, Tinder.

24:04.781 --> 24:07.492
- You're on Tinder?
- Yeah, I'm on Tinder.

24:07.492 --> 24:10.287
Who the fuck is on Tinder in Ennis?

24:10.287 --> 24:14.541
Fuckin' Old Norman Naki and Hank Prior?

24:14.541 --> 24:17.461
No, he's taken. Poor bitch.

24:18.170 --> 24:20.589
Yeah, I set my Tinder radius
for Fairbanks.

24:21.465 --> 24:24.301
Ya know, I'll take some personal trips.
I don't fuck where I eat.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.220
You mean, anymore.

24:28.013 --> 24:29.222
Fuck you.

24:30.098 --> 24:31.975
What do you do when you're lonely?

24:31.975 --> 24:33.685
I watch Netflix.

24:34.853 --> 24:37.481
Come on. For real. What do you do?

24:43.320 --> 24:44.529
I pray.

24:50.952 --> 24:52.162
You pray?

24:53.914 --> 24:56.083
What do you mean, like, get on your knees,

24:56.083 --> 24:58.585
"Our Father, who art in heaven," pray?

24:59.878 --> 25:02.881
Oh, come on. You kiddin' me?
You talk to God?

25:05.175 --> 25:06.176
No.

25:07.594 --> 25:09.012
I listen.

25:18.188 --> 25:22.025
Don't you ever get this feeling, like--

25:23.110 --> 25:27.322
that sometimes you just
wanna just disappear?

25:29.408 --> 25:33.036
Just walk out, never stop?

25:35.288 --> 25:36.915
Just go.

25:39.126 --> 25:40.710
Just go.

25:58.270 --> 25:59.604
Hey.

25:59.896 --> 26:02.524
- Chief Danvers wants you to call--
- She can wait.

26:03.608 --> 26:05.235
Come here for a second.

26:14.536 --> 26:17.164
I was cleanin' out the garage
and I found these.

26:20.751 --> 26:22.627
Yeah, I know, Darwin's only four,

26:22.627 --> 26:26.965
but you were already a pretty damn good
little skater by that age, so.

26:30.218 --> 26:31.678
If ya

26:31.678 --> 26:34.347
take him out, shoot me a text, huh?

26:36.349 --> 26:37.768
Yeah, sure.

26:41.062 --> 26:42.230
What's Danvers up to?

26:43.857 --> 26:46.568
She's goin' through
the trailer's evidence.

26:48.987 --> 26:50.614
She and Navarro?

26:52.032 --> 26:53.075
Yeah.

26:53.075 --> 26:55.786
I don't know what the hell
they're doin' together.

26:55.786 --> 26:57.829
I thought they hated each other.

26:58.330 --> 27:02.125
You know what happened there?
She won't tell me.

27:03.418 --> 27:04.628
No idea.

27:05.170 --> 27:06.505
Hey!

27:07.380 --> 27:09.257
You received a direct call

27:09.257 --> 27:11.927
about Annie K's and Raymond Clark's
relationship.

27:11.927 --> 27:14.387
A direct call, and you didn't report it?

27:14.387 --> 27:16.556
Danvers, tell your girl here
to stand down.

27:16.556 --> 27:18.767
You talk to me.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.936
Tell me why the fuck
you withheld information

27:20.936 --> 27:23.313
- from a murder investigation?
- Oh, please.

27:23.313 --> 27:26.525
That woman was sleeping with
half of Ennis.

27:26.525 --> 27:27.776
What did you want me to do?

27:27.776 --> 27:29.569
Log every dude she was banging
in the region?

27:29.569 --> 27:31.279
You piece of shit. I swear to God...

27:31.279 --> 27:33.281
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Calm the fuck down.

27:33.281 --> 27:34.366
Calm!

27:34.950 --> 27:37.411
And you, go back to your fuckin' search

27:38.203 --> 27:40.580
and get rid of your hillbilly friends.

27:40.580 --> 27:44.418
Or you're gettin' a negligence report
for your mishandling of the Kowtok case.

27:44.418 --> 27:48.922
Maybe I oughta file a report on you
for playing Mrs. Robinson with my kid.

28:00.684 --> 28:02.519
You do your fuckin' job.

28:12.946 --> 28:13.822
That's it?

28:14.406 --> 28:17.242
"Do your fucking job"? That's all he gets?

28:18.785 --> 28:20.996
- Hey, where you goin'?
- Fuck outta here.

28:23.206 --> 28:24.833
Who's Mrs. Robinson?

28:27.419 --> 28:29.296
Where's my forensic tech?

28:29.296 --> 28:32.340
Well, there's a blizzard out in North Bay.

28:32.340 --> 28:34.384
Visibility's shit.
No planes are takin' off,

28:34.384 --> 28:36.762
so they're gonna try again tomorrow.

28:36.762 --> 28:38.680
Tomorrow's no good.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.348
They're gonna thaw.

28:40.348 --> 28:41.725
And they're gettin'
shipped out to Anchorage.

28:41.725 --> 28:43.435
Well, I have an idea.

28:43.894 --> 28:45.228
What?

28:45.228 --> 28:47.647
- I don't know if you're gonna like it.
- Well?

28:49.232 --> 28:53.028
My cousin lives in White Lake.
He's a vet.

28:54.529 --> 28:58.658
Works a lot with large animals.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.871
How long before you can get him here?

29:04.414 --> 29:06.374
- Well, I can call him right now and see.
- Yeah.

29:06.374 --> 29:08.085
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:49.584 --> 29:51.211
Qavvik!

30:02.097 --> 30:03.432
Fucker.

30:04.641 --> 30:06.810
What can I do for you?

30:07.727 --> 30:09.438
Do you know Oliver Tagaq?

30:09.438 --> 30:11.273
He worked at Tsalal for a bit.

30:12.023 --> 30:14.818
Now he might be a hunter,
somewhere out on the ice.

30:14.818 --> 30:17.112
Tagaq? No.

30:17.112 --> 30:22.284
Well, thing is, I know you know someone
who knows someone.

30:22.284 --> 30:24.161
Homebrew comes with a network.

30:24.161 --> 30:26.204
You'll ask around?

30:29.374 --> 30:30.625
For a price.

30:30.625 --> 30:32.711
You want me to pay you?

30:33.253 --> 30:35.005
It's called quid pro quo.

30:35.005 --> 30:38.091
You tell me something.
I tell you something.

30:39.676 --> 30:40.886
Don't get fuckin' cute on me.

30:40.886 --> 30:42.429
I'm not kidding.

30:43.722 --> 30:46.850
You tell me something about yourself

30:48.435 --> 30:50.437
and I'll get you that intel.

30:51.855 --> 30:53.690
Fuck you, Qavvik.

30:57.235 --> 31:00.155
Always lovely to see you, Evangeline.

31:19.091 --> 31:20.425
Da fuck you wanna know?

31:25.889 --> 31:27.099
Your mom.

31:27.808 --> 31:30.644
- Tell me about her.
- Ask Julia.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.938
I'm asking you.

31:33.647 --> 31:35.649
She was local, wasn't she?

31:37.067 --> 31:40.821
Yeah, from a gold mining camp that's gone.

31:40.821 --> 31:43.240
She left when she was 15.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.118
Met my dad in Boston. Boom.

31:46.118 --> 31:50.455
- Now get me Tagaq.
- That's that accent, Boston girl.

31:53.125 --> 31:54.960
But you didn't stay.

31:57.671 --> 31:58.880
No.

32:00.340 --> 32:01.967
Dad was bad.

32:02.968 --> 32:04.386
He drank.

32:05.512 --> 32:06.888
He hit her.

32:08.557 --> 32:12.394
Us too. So Mom took us and ran.

32:12.978 --> 32:15.313
And then we came back up North.

32:16.940 --> 32:19.568
Alaska girls always come back.

32:24.156 --> 32:27.784
She was not okay.

32:28.618 --> 32:29.619
She--

32:30.704 --> 32:32.330
Like Jules?

32:36.626 --> 32:37.836
Yeah.

32:39.504 --> 32:42.883
Voices. Episodes.

32:46.011 --> 32:49.014
Then one day she ran out
and never came back.

32:52.058 --> 32:54.644
- Was she--
- She was killed.

32:54.644 --> 32:56.938
Fucker was never found.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.320
Fuck.

33:07.199 --> 33:09.159
Sorry, Eve.

33:13.955 --> 33:17.584
She never told me my Inupiaq name,
you know?

33:20.212 --> 33:21.630
I wish--

33:28.428 --> 33:29.846
Nothing.

33:30.472 --> 33:33.433
Anyways, there's your intel.

33:34.184 --> 33:35.727
Now get me mine.

34:03.672 --> 34:06.216
They're sick, they're starving,

34:06.216 --> 34:07.467
they're dying.

34:07.467 --> 34:11.263
The fish, the whales,
the seals, the caribou.

34:11.263 --> 34:12.639
What are we gonna eat?

34:12.639 --> 34:15.934
We can't pay for the food in the stores.

34:15.934 --> 34:19.146
Now, even our water's rotten.
They're lying.

34:19.146 --> 34:22.232
They're fucking lying when they say
they're not poisoning us.

34:22.232 --> 34:24.401
We want the truth.

34:25.110 --> 34:27.612
We want truth! We want clean water!

34:28.530 --> 34:30.240
We want clear skies!

34:31.283 --> 34:32.993
We want our animals healthy!

34:33.952 --> 34:35.871
We want the mine to close.

34:35.871 --> 34:38.749
- Close the mine!
- This town was here before them.

34:38.749 --> 34:43.420
- We were here before!
- We were here before!

34:43.420 --> 34:46.715
We were here before! We were here before!

34:46.965 --> 34:49.885
We were here before! We were here before!

34:51.470 --> 34:54.097
You're the Chief of Police's daughter,
aren't you?

34:54.681 --> 34:57.142
No, she's just my stepmom,

34:57.142 --> 34:59.644
- but I don't support--
- It's fine.

34:59.644 --> 35:01.772
Anybody who cares is welcome here.

35:10.363 --> 35:12.741
We were here before!
We were here before!

35:16.995 --> 35:19.414
Hey, hey, hey!

35:21.625 --> 35:27.339
Aviaq and Joe Carter's
baby boy passed this morning.

35:30.675 --> 35:33.095
Another stillborn.

35:33.845 --> 35:36.431
Can we have a minute of silence?

35:37.224 --> 35:38.642
Thank you.

36:47.919 --> 36:48.795
Lee?

36:53.675 --> 36:56.428
- I thought you were gonna help me--
- Hey! I'm changing.

36:57.763 --> 37:00.265
Have you been hangin' out with those
people that are vandalizing the mine?

37:00.265 --> 37:01.933
- No.
- Are you insane?

37:01.933 --> 37:03.518
Do you know what happens to those people?

37:03.518 --> 37:04.936
I'm not insane.

37:04.936 --> 37:07.022
I just fucking care
about this place, alright?

37:07.022 --> 37:08.273
I don't know what you want from me.

37:08.273 --> 37:09.649
I want you to fucking care.

37:09.649 --> 37:11.860
- I do care.
- Bullshit.

37:11.860 --> 37:14.112
I told you to wipe
that shit off your face. Come on.

37:14.112 --> 37:17.032
Did you know Aviaq Carter's baby
was stillborn today?

37:20.160 --> 37:22.788
Sure as hell didn't
care for them, did you?

37:23.872 --> 37:25.791
That shit's comin' off.

37:25.791 --> 37:27.793
- Come on.
- Stop! Let go!

37:27.793 --> 37:29.044
- Get off of me.
- Wipe it off.

37:29.044 --> 37:31.338
- No!
- Now.

37:31.963 --> 37:33.173
Now!

38:23.140 --> 38:24.182
Hey!

38:34.609 --> 38:36.403
<i>Listen...</i>

38:42.826 --> 38:44.995
Tell my mommy.

38:51.501 --> 38:53.545
Oh, fuck.

39:05.348 --> 39:06.308
Hello?

39:06.308 --> 39:09.186
<i>Yes, ma'am, Ms. Navarro?
It's Kenny Hogan.</i>

39:09.186 --> 39:11.021
I'm coverin' for Qavvik.

39:11.021 --> 39:13.565
Yeah, he got no signal.
Do you want me to--

39:13.565 --> 39:16.568
<i>No, ma'am.
This is about your sister, Julia.</i>

39:16.568 --> 39:18.945
Is she okay? What happened?

39:18.945 --> 39:22.240
<i>It's okay. She's fine.</i>

39:23.450 --> 39:24.868
What did she do?

39:25.744 --> 39:28.121
She started screamin'
that someone was comin'

39:28.121 --> 39:31.833
and she was prayin',
she just started prayin'.

39:32.626 --> 39:33.919
<i>She was--</i>

39:35.295 --> 39:37.005
Look, I don't know, it was bad.

39:39.049 --> 39:42.052
<i>I'm sorry,
I just thought you'd like to know.</i>

39:43.470 --> 39:45.055
Where is she?

39:45.055 --> 39:48.141
<i>I don't know, she just ran out.</i>

40:26.805 --> 40:28.765
Aren't you cold, babygirl?

40:28.765 --> 40:30.851
How'd you know where to find me?

40:34.729 --> 40:36.565
You weren't home.

40:39.985 --> 40:41.820
And I know you.

40:52.164 --> 40:53.790
You see that?

40:55.500 --> 40:57.502
That's the water.

40:58.962 --> 41:00.380
The sea.

41:04.259 --> 41:05.886
I think stuff.

41:07.763 --> 41:09.389
Bad stuff.

41:09.890 --> 41:12.100
I know, I know, I know.

41:13.351 --> 41:15.145
I know, baby.

41:57.896 --> 41:59.523
Mama!

42:12.119 --> 42:14.746
Hey, I'm sorry.

42:15.497 --> 42:18.333
- Come to bed?
- I have an exam at seven.

42:19.251 --> 42:20.669
Might as well stay up.

42:36.476 --> 42:38.228
Am I in trouble?

42:40.105 --> 42:43.400
Come on, Kayla, it's just one case
and it'll be over and--

42:43.400 --> 42:47.112
And Danvers will still be calling
day and night, Pete.

42:47.654 --> 42:49.948
And you'll run every time.

42:51.908 --> 42:53.118
Every time.

42:57.497 --> 42:59.791
- You jealous of Danvers?
- Don't be ridiculous.

42:59.791 --> 43:03.670
- Exactly. You married a cop.
- No, I didn't.

43:03.670 --> 43:05.964
You were not a cop.

43:07.299 --> 43:09.885
You were just a sweet idiot
who made me laugh--

43:09.885 --> 43:12.387
Well, what if I don't
wanna be a sweet idiot?

43:14.556 --> 43:16.725
I don't tell you you can't be a doctor.

43:16.725 --> 43:18.226
I'm not a doctor.

43:18.226 --> 43:21.146
I'm in nursing school, with a kid,

43:21.146 --> 43:22.939
married to a cop.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.026
Jesus, Pete.

46:56.403 --> 46:58.530
Yeah, it's weird, right?

46:58.530 --> 47:01.616
Hey, you think that guy
scratched his own eyes out?

47:02.659 --> 47:05.287
How many hours have you been here
staring at this shit?

47:05.871 --> 47:08.331
Prior, crack that phone?

47:08.331 --> 47:11.334
Morning, Chief.
This is my cousin, Vince,

47:11.334 --> 47:13.962
- the vet I was tellin' you about.
- Yeah?

47:13.962 --> 47:15.589
Vince, tell her.

47:16.506 --> 47:17.549
Tell me what?

47:18.717 --> 47:21.678
Yeah. I think they died before they froze.

47:21.678 --> 47:22.637
What?

47:22.637 --> 47:25.098
I mean, they didn't freeze to death.

47:25.766 --> 47:27.058
I've seen plenty of frozen animals,

47:27.058 --> 47:29.770
and cold makes their heart rate drop,
their breath grows shallow.

47:29.770 --> 47:32.481
They basically fall asleep.

47:32.898 --> 47:35.192
All told, a pretty peaceful death.

47:35.192 --> 47:37.402
Those guys, this...

47:37.861 --> 47:39.946
this is not how you die in the cold.

47:39.946 --> 47:43.116
- It's just not.
- What killed 'em?

47:43.116 --> 47:47.204
It's hard to tell without a chance
to properly postmortem them,

47:47.204 --> 47:50.999
but looks like cardiac arrest
if I had to put money on it.

47:51.374 --> 47:54.461
- Oh, well, how can you be sure?
- I can't.

47:55.212 --> 47:57.214
I'm just a vet, ma'am.

47:57.923 --> 48:00.133
But I've seen caribous
die of plain fright.

48:01.134 --> 48:03.345
Running, terrified.

48:03.845 --> 48:07.349
These scientists, they...

48:08.225 --> 48:10.060
they look the same.

48:12.854 --> 48:16.358
So, Vince,

48:17.109 --> 48:19.277
you think you could do
just, like, a tiny bit of postmortem?

48:19.277 --> 48:21.947
- Chief.
- I'm just kidding.

48:22.656 --> 48:24.408
That would be super illegal.

48:25.242 --> 48:26.952
Sorry, Vince. I'll buy you a beer.

48:26.952 --> 48:28.120
- Yeah.
- Thank you, man.

48:29.454 --> 48:31.915
Well, so I guess we wait

48:31.915 --> 48:34.876
and see what information
Anchorage is willing to share with us.

48:34.876 --> 48:37.129
- Yeah.
- Annie's phone. What about it?

48:37.129 --> 48:40.090
Yeah, we're workin' on it.
We should get it back this morning.

48:40.090 --> 48:42.384
- It shouldn't be a problem--
- Oliver Tagaq.

48:45.053 --> 48:46.388
I found him.

48:46.972 --> 48:50.100
- How?
- It's called "Mukluk Telegraph."

48:50.725 --> 48:54.020
- Not for white boys.
- No, no. I'm sorry. The man doesn't exist.

48:54.020 --> 48:56.231
Alright? There's no birth certificates,

48:56.231 --> 49:00.068
there's no school records,
no taxes, nothing for him.

49:00.068 --> 49:02.154
Oh, so, nothing from Tsalal's records.

49:02.154 --> 49:03.697
Yeah, nothin' on the Tsalal records.

49:03.697 --> 49:05.699
- There's nothin'.
- Well,

49:05.699 --> 49:09.035
he's living in a nomad camp
on the North Shore.

49:10.120 --> 49:11.329
Alright.

49:12.289 --> 49:15.125
Not everything is on a computer, freshman.

49:17.544 --> 49:19.129
Fuck.

50:03.423 --> 50:04.633
Hello, sir.

50:05.759 --> 50:08.386
We're looking for a Oliver Tagaq.

50:09.262 --> 50:10.806
And that would be why?

50:11.431 --> 50:14.893
Well, we believe that he may have
some information

50:16.061 --> 50:18.188
regarding Tsalal station.

50:19.981 --> 50:22.901
Sir, Mr. Tagaq is not a suspect.

50:22.901 --> 50:24.986
We just need to chat with him.

50:30.033 --> 50:31.868
Not sure he's around.

50:42.963 --> 50:46.383
Mr. Tagaq? Alaska police.

50:53.890 --> 50:55.100
Hear that?

50:57.144 --> 50:58.478
Yeah, the genny.

50:59.438 --> 51:01.273
Yeah, he's around, alright.

51:03.442 --> 51:05.819
Oh, yeah? Oh, okay.

51:05.819 --> 51:08.321
- That's good.
- What the fuck are you doing?

51:16.455 --> 51:20.083
You're standing on traditional
Inupiaq territory.

51:22.294 --> 51:24.588
Unless you have an order,
if you take one step in,

51:25.297 --> 51:27.215
I'll blow your brains out.

51:28.633 --> 51:29.718
I hear ya.

51:30.177 --> 51:35.891
So, if I go in the state records,
this property is your land?

51:36.516 --> 51:38.685
It's under your name, Mr. Tagaq?

51:38.685 --> 51:41.271
You wanna come and see the deed, lady?

51:45.150 --> 51:46.151
You.

51:46.651 --> 51:49.946
- What's your name?
- I'm A.T. Evangeline Navarro.

51:49.946 --> 51:51.114
No.

51:52.908 --> 51:54.576
Who are you?

51:56.078 --> 51:58.080
I just told you.

51:58.955 --> 52:02.584
Oh, you forgot, didn't you?

52:03.126 --> 52:05.462
We're here to talk about Annie Kowtok.

52:06.213 --> 52:07.422
Annie?

52:09.633 --> 52:12.344
Look, I don't care what you
came here to talk about.

52:12.344 --> 52:14.888
If you don't have an arrest order,
you need to leave.

52:14.888 --> 52:17.516
What, you want us to get one?
We can get one.

52:17.516 --> 52:19.684
An arrest for what?

52:19.684 --> 52:23.939
How about the deaths
of the Tsalal scientists?

52:27.943 --> 52:30.570
Your ex-colleagues.
They're dead.

52:39.913 --> 52:41.915
They all died a week ago.

52:44.167 --> 52:45.377
How?

52:46.878 --> 52:50.340
They died on the ice.
We still don't know what happened.

52:50.340 --> 52:53.093
- Lund is dead?
- No. No, he's in the hospital.

52:53.093 --> 52:55.137
He's not doing well.

52:55.137 --> 52:59.015
Listen, you can talk to us
if there's anything you know.

52:59.015 --> 53:01.476
- Get the hell out of my house!
- No, we just wanna--

53:01.476 --> 53:03.687
- Go, now!
- Alright.

53:04.479 --> 53:06.481
- Get outta here. Out!
- We're gone, we're gone.

53:06.481 --> 53:09.317
Go, now! Don't ever come back!

53:20.120 --> 53:21.747
What was all that shit about your name?

53:21.747 --> 53:23.749
You wouldn't understand.

53:23.749 --> 53:24.791
<i>Chief.</i>

53:26.835 --> 53:30.213
- Danvers.
- <i>Chief, we got a call, from the hospital.</i>

53:30.213 --> 53:31.465
Lund?

53:31.465 --> 53:32.716
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:45.729 --> 53:46.938
The gangrene spread everywhere.

53:46.938 --> 53:49.733
He needed multiple amputations.

53:49.733 --> 53:51.026
He lost his eyesight.

53:51.026 --> 53:53.820
We kept him heavily sedated
but a few hours ago, he started waking up.

53:53.820 --> 53:56.281
- Is he communicating?
- He comes in and out.

53:56.281 --> 53:58.241
He's agitated.

53:58.617 --> 54:00.827
Be prepared. He's hard to look at.

54:05.707 --> 54:07.334
Please be quick.

54:12.506 --> 54:16.051
Dr. Lund, my name is Elizabeth Danvers.

54:16.051 --> 54:18.553
I'm with Alaska police.

54:19.763 --> 54:21.765
What happened that night out on the ice?

54:24.559 --> 54:28.063
Anders, I'm here. Okay? Anders.

54:28.063 --> 54:30.982
- Anders.
- We woke her.

54:30.982 --> 54:33.068
<i>She's awake.</i>

54:33.068 --> 54:37.489
And now she's out.
She's out there in the ice.

54:38.198 --> 54:39.366
Who's out there?

54:39.366 --> 54:43.578
She came for us in the dark.

54:45.705 --> 54:47.082
I'm sedating him.

54:47.499 --> 54:50.335
No. Who's out there?

54:50.335 --> 54:52.129
Who was it? Who is she?

54:52.129 --> 54:54.047
Who came for you?

54:54.047 --> 54:56.007
- Anders, who?
- There's been an accident

54:56.007 --> 54:59.261
on the police search.
Chief Danvers, we need help!

55:00.053 --> 55:01.471
Officers?

55:01.972 --> 55:05.142
- Anders, talk to me.
- Officers?

55:05.142 --> 55:07.269
Fucking hunters are fighting!

55:07.269 --> 55:09.729
Stay with him. Fuckin' hillbillies.

55:09.729 --> 55:10.689
<i>Security to the waiting area.</i>

55:10.689 --> 55:13.358
<i>We need all security to proceed
to the waiting area.</i>

55:19.406 --> 55:21.366
Who are you callin' a redneck?

55:26.663 --> 55:28.832
What are you doing?

55:28.832 --> 55:31.543
Alright, cuffs, cuffs.
Let me see your hands!

55:41.595 --> 55:43.805
Hello, Evangeline.

55:52.981 --> 55:55.817
Your mother says hello.

55:57.819 --> 56:00.655
She's waiting for you.

56:14.711 --> 56:17.297
Defib. Get the crash cart.

56:17.297 --> 56:18.632
Someone get his AVM.

56:20.550 --> 56:22.844
- Stay with us.
- Let's get him intubated.

56:50.330 --> 56:51.748
Pete?

56:55.669 --> 56:56.878
What's up?

56:57.462 --> 56:58.880
Annie's phone.

56:59.381 --> 57:00.799
I cracked it.

57:04.761 --> 57:06.096
<i>I found it.</i>

57:06.096 --> 57:10.183
<i>It's here. I found, I found it.</i>

57:23.905 --> 57:26.491
<i>My name is Annie Kowtok.</i>

57:26.491 --> 57:28.535
<i>If anything happens to me, please--</i>
