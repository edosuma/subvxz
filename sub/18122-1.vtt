WEBVTT

02:11.673 --> 02:13.674
If you get a chance,
get over to Marin.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.301
Check out
the Marin County Arts Fair.
It's amazing,

02:16.386 --> 02:19.471
and it'll be going on through
this Thanksgiving weekend.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.641
Well, nothing's changed.
We've got fog and low clouds

02:22.725 --> 02:26.728
in both the East Bay
and here in San Francisco.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.273
And we're
looking at a high
of 69 degrees

02:29.357 --> 02:31.441
once these clouds burn off.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.611
The time now is 7:23.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.572
Stick with your girl here.
Oh, my gosh.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.575
We'll be coming
at you with much,
much more music.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.588
Hello!

03:01.264 --> 03:02.389
Yoo hoo!

03:08.855 --> 03:10.898
Tommy, turn it off.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.067
We gotta make a baby.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.741
Yeah?

03:22.535 --> 03:23.785
l can't do that now,

03:23.870 --> 03:25.621
'cause l got a drainage issue
with a floor in Paris that. . .

03:25.705 --> 03:26.914
We have
an issue that needs. . .

03:26.998 --> 03:28.373
Resolved first.
. . .to be resolved.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.167
Right now?
lt's red.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.961
Okay, good.
Listen, l'll
talk to you later.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.713
l thought you had
a sentence hearing.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.089
l do,
so we have to hurry.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.299
We've got
seven minutes
for us,

03:37.383 --> 03:39.426
1 5 minutes for resting
with my hips elevated,

03:39.510 --> 03:40.594
and l'll only be
four minutes late

03:40.678 --> 03:41.887
if l check my
messages in the car

03:41.971 --> 03:42.971
and there's no traffic
on the bridge.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.056
Okay.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.850
How about 1 0 minutes for us
and 1 2 minutes
for hip elevation?

03:46.935 --> 03:48.393
Nine and thirteen.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.479
Okay, deal.
Come here.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.566
No. No, no, wait.
lt's actually supposed
to work better

03:54.651 --> 03:55.692
if you're on top.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.944
Okay.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.738
l thought l'd never
hear you say that.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.156
So nice.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.089
l know what they said,
reduced sentence,

04:17.173 --> 04:19.091
but l think l can
get a new trial.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.260
Claire,
l don't know if we should
bite off that much.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.387
lt's a first offense.
We can ask for leniency.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.013
The jury forewoman
is an advocate.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.266
She's not an impartial juror.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.642
l don't know.
l hate to push.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.311
This is a rape case.
l don't wanna piss
the judge off.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.522
Trust me on this, Alex.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.774
Please tell me
you're joking.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.234
Your Honor,
my client is looking

04:37.318 --> 04:39.820
at some serious time in jail
and irreparable damage

04:39.904 --> 04:41.905
while these guys
are laughing
all the way to CNN.

04:41.990 --> 04:42.990
That's ridiculous.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.575
Your Honor,
juror number nine
is a rape victim.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.827
And very much
to her credit,

04:46.911 --> 04:49.788
she's a major fund-raiser
for a sexual assault hot line.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.873
l must point out however,
that the prosecution

04:51.958 --> 04:54.626
should have
submitted those facts
at the voir dire.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.212
And the prosecutorial
misconduct does not
stop there.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.172
Really?
How do you figure that?

04:59.257 --> 05:00.340
This very D.A.'s office

05:00.425 --> 05:02.592
handled
juror number nine's case
eight years ago,

05:02.677 --> 05:04.177
and l find it
impossible to believe

05:04.262 --> 05:06.138
that no one on their team
recognized her.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.723
This is outrageous.
Counselor.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.560
Ms. Kubik,
do you feel that justice
was served?

05:11.644 --> 05:14.104
We're very pleased
that Gary Norris will be
receiving a new trial.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.148
His victim
might say she's been raped
all over again,

05:16.232 --> 05:17.274
this time by the system.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.359
My heart goes out to her,
it really does.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.486
But when
the rights of any defendant
are violated,

05:21.571 --> 05:24.823
we are all at risk
until injustice
is redressed.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.700
Good job.
Thanks.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.412
Good job.
l need to talk to you.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.414
Good, l need gossip.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.251
That was luck, Kubik.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.337
Just like your
Bruins last night.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.463
Sorry about that.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.672
She scores again.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.550
Well, the heart of
American democracy
beats on.

05:43.634 --> 05:44.968
Would you punch up
my calendar, please?

05:45.053 --> 05:46.053
Personal or business?

05:46.137 --> 05:47.804
Both. Thanks.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.473
Hi, big guy.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.683
Good work, Claire.
We're proud of you.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.477
Thank you very much.

05:53.561 --> 05:57.647
l guess l'll just type
"partner" in right here
next to January 1 st.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.275
l didn't know you
were clairvoyant.

06:01.110 --> 06:04.196
Really? Are you serious?

06:04.280 --> 06:05.864
We'll see.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.157
Yes!

06:09.827 --> 06:14.122
Not bad.
l think that was
just lucky.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.375
Bring it on, girl.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.459
Pretty.

06:17.585 --> 06:18.543
Pretty nice.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.753
Pretty lucky.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.046
Well. . .

06:21.130 --> 06:22.672
l'm taking you
to pool school.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.133
l don't think
you have a shot.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.511
Thirteen ball off the five
in the corner pocket.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.471
Not in this lifetime, pal.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.139
Oh, yes.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.599
Okay.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.019
Excuse me, please.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.480
That is not fair.
That is not fair!

06:38.689 --> 06:41.942
You can't hold. . .
No, you can't use
your left hand now.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.945
You're a mutant.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.614
Hey, guys, look!

06:47.698 --> 06:49.950
This was
the scene in City Hall
earlier today.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.077
Ms. Kubik,
do you feel that
justice was served?

06:52.161 --> 06:54.204
We're very pleased
that Gary Norris will
be receiving...

06:54.288 --> 06:55.831
His victim
might say she's been raped

06:55.915 --> 06:57.416
all over again,
this time by the system.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.458
You look great!

06:58.543 --> 06:59.835
My heart
goes out to her,
it really does.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.336
But when the rights
of any defendant...
Look at you.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.631
...are violated,
we are all at risk until
injustice is redressed.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.883
How about
the family? Do you have
any comments for them?

07:06.968 --> 07:08.093
Wow.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.284
l just want one.

08:19.081 --> 08:22.083
Honey, lock the door.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.002
Someone's in the house.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.990
Leave!

09:02.124 --> 09:03.792
- Hurry!
- Wait up!

09:09.799 --> 09:11.174
Damn kids.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.094
lt's okay, honey.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.638
225 Dover.
Send somebody right away.
They're gone.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.348
Are you okay?

09:24.105 --> 09:25.397
Oh, God.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.402
l'm fine.

09:44.834 --> 09:45.917
How old is he?

09:46.002 --> 09:47.294
Fourteen months.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.089
Uh-oh. Cute baby alert.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.342
Hi. Can we meet your baby?

09:56.095 --> 09:58.847
Hi ! Oh, my God,
what a doll.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.807
He's in a pretty good mood.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.665
There's this, well. . .
Because he had on
a T-shirt or something,

10:25.750 --> 10:28.251
and the T-shirt was just
a huge hit afterwards.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.462
Men all across America
were buying T-shirts.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.423
l always liked
lt's a Wonderful Life.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.177
Nice.
Christmas domestic.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.180
Yeah, that's the spirit.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.723
lnteresting.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.017
Real interesting.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.685
Keys, please.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.983
What is it, baby?

10:52.735 --> 10:53.985
FBl !

10:55.196 --> 10:56.529
Get down !

10:56.614 --> 10:57.656
Get down, honey.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.740
What?

10:58.824 --> 10:59.991
Get down !

11:00.576 --> 11:03.578
Get down on the ground now!

11:06.624 --> 11:07.832
Get down !

11:07.917 --> 11:09.751
Okay!

11:09.835 --> 11:10.835
Stay down !

11:10.920 --> 11:12.003
Leave her alone!

11:13.506 --> 11:15.548
You cuffed him?
You cuffed him?
l got it, yeah.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.633
Did you cuff him?

11:18.886 --> 11:20.512
Screwed up
the whole damn thing.
You know you're looking

11:20.596 --> 11:22.681
at a multimillion
dollar lawsuit, right,
Mr. Mulkins?

11:22.765 --> 11:25.141
Excess use of force,
harassment,
reckless endangerment.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.184
How's that for starters?

11:26.268 --> 11:27.519
lt's Mullins, Mrs. Kubik.

11:27.603 --> 11:28.687
Special Agent Mullins.

11:28.771 --> 11:32.023
You have a warrant
for the arrest of someone
named Ron Chapman.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.316
My husband is Tom Kubik.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.526
Your computer is
obviously having

11:34.610 --> 11:35.694
some kind of
a psychotic break.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.654
lt wasn't our computer.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.447
lf your people had
gotten any closer,

11:39.532 --> 11:41.908
you would have
burned the guy,
all right?

11:41.992 --> 11:43.952
Fine. Forget about it.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.664
lt wasn't our computer.
lt was Marin P. D.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.542
They ran all the fingerprints
after your house was
burglarized,

11:50.626 --> 11:51.876
and l'll tell
you something else.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.753
The AFlS flagged
your husband's.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.547
They've been in
the system for 1 2 years.

11:55.631 --> 11:58.216
And once again,
what is he being
accused of?

11:58.300 --> 11:59.384
l'm sorry,
but l can't tell you.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.510
Come on.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.053
You know
that having been
subject to arrest,

12:02.138 --> 12:04.013
l have the right
to know the charges.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.641
No, you don't.
Not when it's
a military court,

12:06.726 --> 12:09.686
and not when
national security
is involved.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.438
Military court?

12:55.483 --> 12:56.441
Hello?

12:56.525 --> 12:57.609
Oh, my God.
Thank God l caught you.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.612
l was totally freaked out
that you were gonna be
out of town or something.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.322
And l caught you
on the news.

13:02.406 --> 13:04.532
Claire, you have to stop
letting them
mess with your hair.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.785
Jackie?
Sweetie,
l just need some money.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.453
l hate to ask...
Well, not really,
but anyway

13:08.537 --> 13:10.747
can you just help me out?
Please?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.625
My landlord's
breathing down my neck
right now, as we speak.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.919
lf you say no,
l'm gonna be evicted.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.462
Can you come get me?

13:21.091 --> 13:22.592
l know what it could be.

13:22.676 --> 13:23.968
Maybe what it is,
is that he did something

13:24.053 --> 13:26.763
that he doesn't
even know he did,
and so he's in, like. . .

13:26.847 --> 13:27.806
That's enough, Jackie.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.641
No, but he's in, like,
witness protection or
something.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.810
Just stop it, please.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.102
Sorry.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.650
Next time you need help,
call your other sister.
No, wait.

13:38.734 --> 13:39.818
You don't have
another sister.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.569
l didn't call you, Jackie.
You called me.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.822
Yeah, and l came here
to pick you up, and it's,
like, the first time

13:43.906 --> 13:46.783
you've tried to
see me in months,
by the way.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.416
The base is in San Lazaro.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.127
lt's about 45 minutes
south of L.A. on the coast.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.921
Uh-huh.
Yeah, l booked you
a flight into

14:00.005 --> 14:01.756
John Wayne Airport
in Orange County.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.800
Okay, with luggage?
Luggage, rental car.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.927
You should be on the base
between 1 1 :00, 1 1 :30.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.622
Good afternoon, ma'am.
May l see l. D. , please?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.082
All right.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.521
Mrs. Kubik.
James Hernandez.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.773
Ron and l were
in the same unit.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.359
This must be
a terrible shock to you,
ma'am,

15:44.443 --> 15:45.485
but if there's
anything l can do. . .

15:45.569 --> 15:49.530
Anderson. Atchison.
Chapman. Green.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.408
Ron was a good Marine.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.118
Now, l won't keep you.
Good luck.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.203
Thank you.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.704
At the end of the hall,
ma'am.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.375
Room B, ma'am.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.234
What the. . .

16:29.863 --> 16:31.447
Where the hell
are his clothes?

16:31.532 --> 16:32.573
Suicide watch, ma'am.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.409
l want
clothes put on him
right now.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.119
You'd have to
file that request
with the brig command

16:36.203 --> 16:38.079
on your way out.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.643
ls your name Ron Chapman?

17:13.531 --> 17:14.615
Yes.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.131
How. . .

17:36.388 --> 17:38.598
l don't know what to say.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.060
l had no choice.

17:43.103 --> 17:46.564
l had no. . .
l had no choice.

17:47.649 --> 17:51.569
They were
accusing me of something
that l didn't do.

17:51.653 --> 17:52.987
Please believe me.

17:53.572 --> 17:54.906
Believe you?

17:59.912 --> 18:03.081
Well, l believed that

18:03.165 --> 18:05.083
you were raised
in a foster home.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.292
l was.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.294
That you were never married.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.420
Claire.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.090
That you don't
have any children.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.592
That you love me, Ron.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.346
Tom. Whatever your name is.

18:24.686 --> 18:29.023
l do love you.
But l did not do this.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.776
Okay?

18:36.406 --> 18:39.617
l swear that
l never did this.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.621
And l didn't
want to tell you,

18:43.705 --> 18:46.541
'cause l didn't
want you to leave me.

18:56.677 --> 18:57.385
What happened?

18:59.721 --> 19:01.389
My lawyer's here.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.478
Mrs. Kubik?

19:08.438 --> 19:09.772
Sorry to interrupt.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.774
First Lieutenant Embry.
Terrence.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.568
Hi.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.699
l'm older than l look. So. . .

19:22.411 --> 19:24.453
Well, l'll let you two. . .

19:25.247 --> 19:27.456
l'll wait in the. . .

19:35.757 --> 19:36.966
Claire.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.928
Just let me go
talk to him, okay?

19:51.106 --> 19:53.024
First Lieutenant,
is that what l call you?

19:53.108 --> 19:54.150
Lieutenant.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.860
Okay, why the hell
haven't you filed
a request

19:55.944 --> 19:58.863
to get him out of
those goddamn chains
and into some clothes?

19:58.947 --> 20:00.239
Right, yeah.
l'll take care of it.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.616
Lieutenant,
l'm an attorney.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.285
May l please see
the charging document?

20:04.369 --> 20:05.536
We call it a charge sheet.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.705
Fabulous. May l see it?

20:09.958 --> 20:11.751
Can you give me
the basics?

20:11.835 --> 20:15.338
Article 85, desertion.
Article 90, assaulting

20:15.422 --> 20:17.882
or willfully disobeying
a superior
commissioned officer.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.218
Murder? Nine. . .

20:20.302 --> 20:23.429
Yes, if convicted,
he'll get
the death penalty.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.395
Who's prosecuting?

20:31.480 --> 20:34.982
Major Lucas Waldron
has been detailed
as trial counsel.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.109
He any good?

20:37.194 --> 20:38.236
The best.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.113
How about you?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.740
l do okay.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.825
Have you ever
won a case?

20:45.994 --> 20:47.119
No.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.545
l'm going to defend you.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.464
l know you didn't
kill nine people.

20:58.548 --> 20:59.590
Mrs. Kubik,
this is a. . .

20:59.675 --> 21:01.259
l don't want you
involved in this.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.927
l'm already involved.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.554
You don't understand.
Military law is not
the same.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.348
l'll learn.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.184
We're gonna
fight them, okay?
Together.

21:16.984 --> 21:20.236
You remember those
three American kids?

21:20.529 --> 21:24.699
Students who were killed
in that café in El Salvador,
back in '99?

21:24.783 --> 21:26.158
Not the camera, man.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.954
lt was a little town
called Monte Azul.

21:30.539 --> 21:34.375
A member of a rebel group
threw a satchel bomb
into that café.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.130
Press had a field day.

21:39.214 --> 21:41.215
Right. Everybody went nuts.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.510
So they call up my unit,
Detachment 27,

21:44.594 --> 21:47.138
to locate the rebel leader
who was responsible.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.682
He was a terrorist
by the name of
Danilo Chacon.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.517
And your orders came from?

21:51.601 --> 21:54.103
Our CO at Camp Lejeune.
Bill Marks.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.271
Anyways. . .

21:55.355 --> 21:59.233
Wait. l'm sorry.
Brigadier General Marks?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.819
Special Representative
to the Joint Congressional
Committee

22:01.903 --> 22:04.864
on Military Appropriations,
Bill Marks?

22:04.948 --> 22:08.117
Yes. He was
Colonel Bill Marks
back then.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.245
Under his orders,

22:11.997 --> 22:15.499
we were sent into
a little village
called Las Colinas.

22:16.418 --> 22:17.710
lt's not even a village,
even.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.087
Just some fields,
a few huts.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.555
Danilo Chacon was supposed
to be hiding out there.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.349
And. . .

22:34.603 --> 22:36.145
lt was supposed
to be routine.

22:47.532 --> 22:48.532
But somebody lost it.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.744
l hear gunfire.

22:52.954 --> 22:55.373
By the time
l get to the other
end of the village,

22:55.457 --> 22:58.042
nine people are slaughtered,
and. . .

22:58.126 --> 22:59.293
God damn.

23:00.545 --> 23:04.840
l'm just standing there.
Old women, men, kids,
just dead.

23:04.925 --> 23:09.762
And l lost it.
l jumped the guy
who did it.

23:10.389 --> 23:14.767
And next thing l know,
l'm looking at first degree,
nine specs.

23:15.435 --> 23:16.769
Who did it?

23:16.853 --> 23:17.978
Hernandez.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.065
Jimmy Hernandez.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.983
He ordered me to
keep my mouth shut.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.235
Said he was
teaching them a lesson,

23:24.319 --> 23:26.404
that Marks would
back him up 1 00%.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.489
l told him to go to hell.

23:28.573 --> 23:31.075
Major Hernandez?
Marks' top aide?

23:31.159 --> 23:32.284
Yes.

23:34.413 --> 23:38.165
He introduced
himself to me yesterday,
in the waiting area.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.583
What?

23:46.633 --> 23:48.384
Claire,
l want you to listen to me.

23:48.468 --> 23:50.177
l want you to
stay away from him.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.638
He's extremely dangerous.
Do you understand?

23:52.722 --> 23:54.849
So, General Marks. . .

23:54.933 --> 23:58.727
See, he's like
the most decorated,
most powerful, most. . .

24:00.188 --> 24:02.231
And you're saying
you were framed

24:02.315 --> 24:05.693
by General Marks and
his special assistant.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.155
That's our defense?

24:11.199 --> 24:12.324
Yup.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.377
Claire, would you
sit down for a minute?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.254
l'm not gonna pretend
l'm looking forward

24:25.338 --> 24:28.382
to seeing the firm's name
even remotely connected
to this.

24:28.467 --> 24:32.303
As it stands now,
nobody knows Ron Chapman
is Tom Kubik.

24:32.387 --> 24:33.804
Alex, my husband is innocent.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.848
l'm not considering
any other possibility.

24:35.932 --> 24:37.433
And l'm even
less interested
than you are

24:37.517 --> 24:39.977
in seeing his name
associated with
a mass murder.

24:40.061 --> 24:44.190
Claire, l just want you
to understand

24:44.274 --> 24:46.150
all the possible
unforeseen consequences.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.152
You know what, Alex?
l'll make it
real easy for you.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.696
lf the firm's name
gets dragged into this,
you don't have to fire me.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.573
l'll resign.

24:52.657 --> 24:55.826
Hey, Josh,
remember that thing
from the 20. . .

24:55.911 --> 24:57.161
Thank you.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.829
Claire, can l do anything?

24:58.914 --> 25:02.958
Yeah. l need a lawyer,
somebody from
the Marine Corps,

25:03.543 --> 25:04.585
somebody who's
beaten them before

25:04.669 --> 25:06.170
and is hungry to
beat them again.

25:06.254 --> 25:07.755
Where will you be?

26:04.938 --> 26:06.814
Bill. Bill.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.191
William.

26:14.698 --> 26:18.075
l'm looking for
a Charlie Grimes.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.746
Well, don't tell me
you need a lawyer,
because you are one.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.251
l followed the Norris case.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.169
Talk about
a rabbit out of a hat.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.172
Are you Charles W. Grimes?

26:32.257 --> 26:35.092
You just can't get
over my decorator,
can you?

26:35.176 --> 26:37.261
Welcome to
Grimes and Associate.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.096
Associate?

26:39.180 --> 26:40.389
Delilah?

26:43.101 --> 26:45.311
Rumor has it that
you're a very good
attorney,

26:45.395 --> 26:47.563
formerly of the JAG Corps.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.065
ln another life.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.525
And in that former life,
you had an affair

26:51.610 --> 26:53.986
with your
superior officer's wife,
and they pushed you out.

26:54.070 --> 26:57.281
Let's not dwell on
my youthful offenses,
Mrs. Kubik. What do you want?

26:57.365 --> 26:59.950
The military has
set up my husband,

27:00.076 --> 27:03.454
and they've assigned
some junior varsity
lieutenant to defend him.

27:03.538 --> 27:04.913
Who's prosecuting?

27:04.998 --> 27:06.081
Waldron.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.128
Tell your husband
to cop a plea.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.921
Try to make a deal
with the judge.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.632
Military justice
is to justice

27:14.716 --> 27:16.925
as military music is
to music, Mrs. Kubik.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.761
Wake up and smell the napalm.

27:18.845 --> 27:21.347
Charlie, you're not
gonna believe this shit.

27:21.431 --> 27:22.931
They busted me again.

27:23.558 --> 27:29.063
lt's like
every time l turn around,
they slap handcuffs on me.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.981
That's because every time
you turn around,

27:31.066 --> 27:34.610
you've got some
private's privates
standing at attention, Lola.

27:34.694 --> 27:38.155
You know, l perform
a very important service
for the military.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.990
There's a novel defense.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.534
You do somebody
at the base, too?

27:42.619 --> 27:44.119
Yeah, actually.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.581
How about your lawyer here?
ls he any good?

27:47.707 --> 27:50.084
When he gets off
his ass, yeah.

27:51.252 --> 27:53.295
How about it, Mr. Grimes?

27:53.755 --> 27:55.631
Man,
turn this shit off.

27:55.715 --> 27:56.757
Nice to meet you, Lola.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.676
l'm due in court
in an hour.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.260
Hey! ln an hour?

28:18.988 --> 28:20.239
Jackie.

28:20.323 --> 28:21.532
l'm here to help,

28:21.616 --> 28:24.034
'cause what are
sisters for?

28:26.496 --> 28:28.664
Wow. Tacky.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.835
You got evicted,
didn't you?

28:32.919 --> 28:34.712
What happened to
the money l sent?

28:34.796 --> 28:36.630
Too little too late,
too much credit card debt.

28:37.132 --> 28:39.174
All l need's
an extra phone line.
What for?

28:39.259 --> 28:42.261
My new job.
Psychic hot line.

28:42.595 --> 28:44.555
Don't laugh.
l'm really good at it.

29:09.497 --> 29:12.583
Twenty-nine past the hour
if you're on your way to work.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.376
Otherwise, kick back.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.587
l got you covered,
wall-to-wall.

29:16.671 --> 29:17.755
Good morning, Lieutenant.

29:17.839 --> 29:18.797
Good morning, Mrs. Kubik.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.508
l'm gonna kill
that goddamn clock.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.470
Hi, G. l. Joe.

29:24.554 --> 29:25.596
Ma'am.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.097
"Ma'am."

29:27.182 --> 29:29.767
Claire,
did you just hear that?
He just called me ma'am.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.602
Shall we?

29:31.686 --> 29:32.936
Yeah, let's
get out of here.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.942
So l do not
need any security clearance
for the pretrial portion.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.278
Yes, exactly. The only
portions of the trial
that are classified

29:41.362 --> 29:44.698
are those pertaining
directly to the incidents
in El Salvador.

29:45.241 --> 29:51.288
So, l just. . . You know,
l hope she didn't
think l was staring.

29:51.831 --> 29:52.831
Who?

29:52.916 --> 29:54.166
Well, your sister.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.043
Don't worry about it.
She understands.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.711
She's psychic.

29:58.463 --> 29:59.713
Okay.

30:03.009 --> 30:04.134
Well, what do you know?

30:04.219 --> 30:07.137
Mr. Grimes has decided
to join us after all.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.264
Mrs. Kubik, you do know
that Charlie Grimes

30:09.349 --> 30:11.934
has a history of
being a major drunk?

30:21.361 --> 30:23.487
Are you sober, Mr. Grimes?

30:25.323 --> 30:28.075
Four hundred and
sixty-two days,
Mrs. Kubik.

30:28.701 --> 30:32.037
Ain't life grand?
Fill me in.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.997
Pretrial hearing is in 1 0.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.123
Ten what?

30:35.208 --> 30:36.542
Minutes.

30:39.128 --> 30:40.379
What?

30:43.424 --> 30:46.593
You don't think
they'll be impressed
with leather?

30:51.724 --> 30:52.808
Who's the judge?

30:52.892 --> 30:54.142
Colonel Farrell.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.271
Yeah, it would be.

30:58.314 --> 31:02.067
Full bird colonel
at his terminal rank.

31:02.151 --> 31:05.153
He'll piss all over us
because we're civilians,

31:05.280 --> 31:08.240
and he won't give a shit
about reversals down the line

31:08.324 --> 31:10.701
because he's
about ready to retire.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.411
You file any motions?
Absolutely.

31:12.495 --> 31:14.329
Dismiss all charges,
insufficient evidence.

31:14.414 --> 31:15.497
Motion denied.

31:15.582 --> 31:16.748
You haven't even
read the brief.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.959
No doubt neither has Farrell.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.920
The whole
military judicial system
is based on denial.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.255
Then we fight
the system.

31:23.339 --> 31:26.675
No, no, no.
You play by the rules.

31:26.759 --> 31:28.802
You do not
fight the system.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.929
Fight the system,
you lose.

31:31.472 --> 31:34.308
lsn't that right, Embry?
Say, "Yes, sir."

31:34.392 --> 31:35.392
Yes, sir.

31:35.476 --> 31:36.935
Don't be a sap, Embry.

31:37.645 --> 31:40.063
Nobody in a uniform
can think for himself.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.232
This is a pretrial hearing,
Mr. Grimes.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.985
The goal is to listen
and not reveal anything.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.237
Do we have
anything to reveal,
Mrs. Kubik?

31:47.322 --> 31:48.363
Claire.
Claire?

31:48.448 --> 31:49.489
No.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.866
No?
Then that ought to work.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.380
Which one's the prosecutor?

32:05.465 --> 32:08.091
Trial counsel.
We call them
trial counsels.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.385
Mrs. Kubik,
l'm Major Waldron.

32:10.470 --> 32:11.678
How do you do?

32:12.430 --> 32:13.931
Hi, Lucas.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.267
Charlie Grimes.
lt's nice to see you.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.644
Bullshit.

32:19.562 --> 32:21.021
All rise.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.030
Be seated.

32:31.157 --> 32:34.076
This Article 39-A session
is called to order.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.079
l'm Colonel Farrell
of the U.S. Marine Corps.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.498
Where the hell
is the accused?

32:56.224 --> 32:58.600
Charlie Grimes.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.227
l'll explain later.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.693
Sergeant Chapman,
you see the charges
against you.

33:07.777 --> 33:08.819
How do you plead?

33:08.903 --> 33:10.529
Your Honor,
before my client
submits a plea,

33:10.613 --> 33:11.613
would you please
address our motion

33:11.698 --> 33:12.864
to have all
charges dismissed?

33:12.949 --> 33:13.991
Motion denied.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.743
Since you are painfully
unfamiliar with our
court-martial system,

33:16.828 --> 33:18.120
we don't have clients here.

33:18.204 --> 33:19.955
Sergeant Ron Chapman
is the accused,

33:20.039 --> 33:21.748
and l'm still waiting
for the plea.

33:24.168 --> 33:27.546
l plead not guilty.
Not guilty.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.381
You may be seated.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.884
Your Honor,
prosecution requests
the court's ruling

33:32.969 --> 33:34.928
on the permissibility
of the accused

33:35.013 --> 33:36.930
being represented
by his spouse.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.765
Your Honor. . .
l'll allow it.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.308
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:40.393 --> 33:44.062
The prosecution requests
a short pretrial
period to ensure security.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.522
Granted.
Opening statements are

33:45.606 --> 33:47.232
scheduled for
one week from today.

33:47.316 --> 33:50.527
Objection ! Your Honor,
there's no way we can
prepare defense

33:50.611 --> 33:52.404
for a capital case
in one week.

33:52.488 --> 33:54.865
Noted and overruled.
Are we done?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.325
Your Honor, l'd like to add
that the defense
has no intention

33:57.410 --> 33:59.661
of waiving our
right to a public trial

33:59.746 --> 34:01.371
as guaranteed by
the Sixth Amendment.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.874
Your Honor,
this case involves
national security

34:03.958 --> 34:05.250
and classified information.

34:05.334 --> 34:06.877
We would like
defense counsel
admonished

34:06.961 --> 34:08.378
that any attempt
to try this case
in the media

34:08.463 --> 34:10.380
would be a direct violation
of this court's order.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.257
Your Honor,
co-counsel and l are
civilians

34:12.341 --> 34:14.717
and not subject
to military orders.

34:14.802 --> 34:18.929
Any such orders, sir,
will be taken for
informational purposes only.

34:19.014 --> 34:20.891
Be advised, Counsel,
that civilian or not,

34:20.975 --> 34:22.809
you can go to
the brig and
be disqualified

34:22.893 --> 34:25.103
from participating in
this trial altogether.

34:25.688 --> 34:26.980
All rise.

34:35.697 --> 34:37.699
And so it begins.

34:38.576 --> 34:40.202
See you soon.

34:41.661 --> 34:43.955
He's supposed
to be the best.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.585
What the hell was that?

34:50.505 --> 34:52.755
l said you should
follow the rules.

34:52.840 --> 34:53.965
l'm the wild card.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.509
You could've gotten us
thrown off the case.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.427
Nah, it's too early.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.387
See, if they think
we're gonna go public,

34:59.472 --> 35:01.973
we might get an idea
how scared they are.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.558
What do you think, Embryo?

35:03.643 --> 35:06.645
l think, "Why me?
Why was l assigned
to this case?"

35:10.191 --> 35:14.194
Seven guys in Tom's unit,
and all of them say he did it.

35:14.570 --> 35:17.739
But only two of
these eyewitnesses
are on their list.

35:17.824 --> 35:18.949
Hernandez and Troy Abbott.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.575
Now what happened
to the other five?

35:20.660 --> 35:21.785
Dead.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.121
All of them?

35:24.205 --> 35:25.330
Dead how?

35:25.706 --> 35:29.084
Two were killed in combat,
the Gulf and Panama.

35:29.168 --> 35:30.293
One was murdered.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.295
And the other two,
accidents.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.382
Accidents?
Mmm-hmm.

35:35.883 --> 35:38.844
l know a couple of Pl's,
ex-Green Berets.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.304
Not very ethical,

35:41.389 --> 35:43.140
but maybe they
could get us the
unofficial version

35:43.224 --> 35:45.058
of how these guys died.

35:45.893 --> 35:47.519
Could be useful.

35:48.020 --> 35:50.981
Here we go. Troy Abbott,
Sacramento, California.

35:51.065 --> 35:54.901
Doing four to six in Lompoc,
armed robbery.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.989
And Waldron's office
is trying to
expedite his parole.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.700
Now, why am l certain
he's gonna succeed?

36:01.784 --> 36:05.162
'Cause it's the Marine Corps.
"Be all you can be."

36:05.246 --> 36:06.329
That's the Army.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.624
Yeah, Mrs. Kubik,
l really think our theory

36:09.709 --> 36:12.210
should be that
Hernandez acted alone.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.420
l mean,
no one's gonna believe

36:13.504 --> 36:15.839
that Brigadier General Marks
was in on this.

36:15.923 --> 36:18.216
ln other words,
you don't believe it.

36:19.927 --> 36:22.262
Mrs. Kubik,
that's not my point.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.598
Do you believe Tom or not?

36:24.682 --> 36:27.601
Easy. He's just
expressing his opinion.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.520
lsn't there something
you should be
doing somewhere else?

36:30.605 --> 36:31.897
Not really.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.526
Can l get you
another coffee, sir?

36:36.611 --> 36:38.695
No, ma'am. l'm good.

36:39.614 --> 36:40.906
Okay.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.619
Come here.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.371
Now, l'm gonna have
to agree with Embry.

36:48.456 --> 36:52.751
A guy like Marks
smells, looks,
tastes credible.

36:52.835 --> 36:55.879
Put him on the stand,
he's just gonna give
Hernandez credibility.

36:55.963 --> 36:57.464
Right,
that's what l'm saying.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.925
Well, young man's had
an original thought.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.093
You know what?
What?

37:02.178 --> 37:03.220
- That my line?
- No.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.222
Go to hell.
Another one.

37:05.306 --> 37:06.473
Hello?
Mrs. Kubik,

37:06.557 --> 37:08.892
will you hold
for Major Waldron?

37:08.976 --> 37:10.769
Yes, l'll hold
for Major Waldron.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.855
Hello, Mrs. Kubik.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.148
Hello, Major.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.943
Why don't you folks
come down to my
office about 9:00?

37:18.027 --> 37:19.778
Let's try to
work something out.

37:19.862 --> 37:21.238
We'll be there.

37:24.659 --> 37:27.494
l can't believe it.
They want a deal.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.538
l love being a wild card.

37:32.291 --> 37:35.669
Mr. Kubik, sir,
voluntary manslaughter,

37:35.753 --> 37:38.922
only one specification,
that's only five years.

37:39.006 --> 37:42.759
Plus one condition,
that you sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

37:42.843 --> 37:45.428
And as your counsel, l. . .
Claire,

37:45.513 --> 37:48.515
tell the man
to take the deal
of the century.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.893
Sweetheart?
Honey,

37:51.978 --> 37:55.647
l won't do five minutes
for a crime l didn't commit.

37:55.731 --> 37:57.440
Do you have any idea,
any of you,

37:57.525 --> 37:59.192
do you have any idea
what it's like to spend

37:59.277 --> 38:02.070
23 hours a day
in a 6-by-8 cell?

38:02.863 --> 38:04.406
Five years in Leavenworth.

38:04.490 --> 38:07.367
They'll make sure
l'm dead
long before that.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.663
So, motion denied.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.970
Come on in.
Based on our conversation. . .

38:27.054 --> 38:28.930
That's all right, Major.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.099
We're here to tell you
we're gonna pass.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.476
Thanks anyway.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.481
Mrs. Kubik.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.777
Personally, l'm quite happy
to go to trial with this case,

38:42.862 --> 38:45.322
but there is a lot
of interest in putting
this thing behind us.

38:45.406 --> 38:48.491
lt works for everyone,
command and your husband.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.828
And Major Hernandez
and General Marks.

38:51.912 --> 38:53.872
See you in court, sir.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.252
...here on
the Fantasy Jewelry Hour.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.589
You can
normally expect to pay $1 99
for a ring like this.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.007
Yes, you would, Jim,

39:04.091 --> 39:07.260
and this beautiful piece
is available right now...

39:07.345 --> 39:09.304
So, no deal.

39:09.388 --> 39:13.099
Can you believe
l asked my husband to do
five years in prison?

39:13.184 --> 39:17.896
Go ahead.
Tell me what a waste of
oxygen all lawyers are.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.817
So if you're
on the phone right now,
don't get off the line.

39:22.902 --> 39:23.902
You're not gonna
wanna miss this.

39:23.986 --> 39:25.278
That's right.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.865
You're curiously quiet
on the subject.

39:32.453 --> 39:35.205
Jackie, would you
please turn that down?
l mean, come on. . .

39:42.838 --> 39:45.590
Your husband
came to my village
and killed my family.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.469
And it's true,
lawyers are
a waste of oxygen.

39:50.304 --> 39:51.388
Drop this deal. . .

39:52.556 --> 39:53.640
Jackie? Mrs. Kubik?

40:04.819 --> 40:06.277
Hey.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.781
He ran out.

40:10.825 --> 40:13.451
Claire?
Claire, are you okay?

40:18.999 --> 40:20.208
Bastards!

40:21.585 --> 40:24.337
lt's Hernandez.
Oh, God damn.

40:25.881 --> 40:29.092
We turned down their deal,
and he's trying to scare us.

40:29.176 --> 40:31.511
Baby, you don't know
how these people work.

40:31.595 --> 40:34.180
l don't know
how any of it works.

40:34.723 --> 40:35.849
What do you mean?

40:35.975 --> 40:38.518
This other life of yours.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.104
You don't believe me,
do you?

40:41.188 --> 40:42.480
Of course l believe you.

40:42.565 --> 40:45.150
Baby, l'll take a polygraph.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.445
There's no need for it.
lt's not even
admissible in court.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.196
The hell with the courts.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.698
l wanna do it for us.

40:55.536 --> 40:58.955
Hey, Ronnie
or Tommy or Paco
or whatever it is.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.457
You haven't changed a bit.
Major Hernandez,

41:00.541 --> 41:01.624
this is
an unethical ex parte.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.293
l'm just here to help.

41:03.377 --> 41:04.502
What are you doing here?

41:04.587 --> 41:06.629
Hey, you ought to
plead this out, Ace.

41:06.714 --> 41:11.009
Major. . .
Tom, don't! Stop it!
Stop!

41:11.093 --> 41:13.094
You're making it worse!

41:20.227 --> 41:21.978
Who let Major Hernandez
in here?

41:22.062 --> 41:24.481
He's not authorized
to be in here!

41:24.565 --> 41:26.983
See? Look at your killer!
He is provoking my client!

41:27.067 --> 41:29.360
Who is in charge?
Who let him in here?
Look at your killer!

41:29.445 --> 41:30.862
He's not supposed
to be in here!

41:30.946 --> 41:32.697
Major Hernandez said
he was a defense witness.

41:32.781 --> 41:34.782
He is not a witness
for the defense!

41:34.867 --> 41:36.784
Who is in charge?

41:36.869 --> 41:39.704
l want to talk to
whoever is in charge!

41:43.709 --> 41:46.002
ls your real name
Ron Chapman?

41:46.795 --> 41:47.921
Yes.

41:49.340 --> 41:53.343
Regarding the incident
at Las Colinas
on March 1 5, 1 988,

41:53.427 --> 41:55.553
will you answer my
questions truthfully?

41:55.638 --> 41:56.679
Yes.

41:56.764 --> 41:59.224
Did you actively participate
in the death of anyone

41:59.308 --> 42:02.268
during the 1 5th of March,
1 988, shootings?

42:14.615 --> 42:15.782
Mrs. Kubik?

42:24.333 --> 42:26.042
You passed.

42:26.126 --> 42:27.961
Of course l passed.

42:35.844 --> 42:37.554
Are we being monitored?

42:37.638 --> 42:40.098
No, it's absolutely secure.

42:41.100 --> 42:42.767
Absolutely secure?

42:44.311 --> 42:45.979
What do you mean?

42:47.481 --> 42:49.649
What do you think l mean?

43:15.301 --> 43:17.343
And, Lieutenant Colonel,

43:18.721 --> 43:23.016
were there any eyewitnesses
to this massacre?

43:23.601 --> 43:25.810
Yes. We had
seven eyewitness
statements

43:25.894 --> 43:28.104
all l. D.-ing
Chapman as the shooter.

43:28.188 --> 43:32.358
Thank you.
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

43:43.829 --> 43:48.666
Colonel LaPierre,
you were, and still are,

43:48.751 --> 43:51.544
a special agent
with the Criminal
lnvestigations Division

43:51.629 --> 43:53.588
in charge of this
investigation, yes?

43:53.672 --> 43:54.964
That's correct.

43:55.049 --> 43:58.301
So when you say
that the investigation
was not flawed,

43:58.385 --> 44:01.554
you're basically
giving yourself
a big thumbs-up.

44:02.806 --> 44:04.807
l'm just expressing
my opinion.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.809
So help you God,
no doubt.

44:06.894 --> 44:11.898
Now, is it possible,
Colonel, that these
so-called witnesses

44:11.982 --> 44:14.609
were coached
before you got
your hands on them?

44:14.693 --> 44:17.445
l guess it's possible,
but unlikely.

44:18.530 --> 44:21.866
And are you aware
that of the seven witnesses,

44:21.950 --> 44:24.744
two were
subsequently killed
in combat?

44:24.828 --> 44:26.412
Yes, l'm aware of that.

44:26.497 --> 44:32.251
And another three,
three relatively young men,
have died as well?

44:33.087 --> 44:34.671
Yes.
Let's see.

44:35.756 --> 44:39.717
There was a Lieutenant Allen
of Longview, Texas,
hit and run.

44:39.802 --> 44:43.930
A Sergeant Stenstrom of Taos,
New Mexico,
accidental drowning.

44:44.640 --> 44:48.267
And the other,
an unfortunate
mountain climbing fall.

44:49.061 --> 44:50.061
That sounds right.

44:50.145 --> 44:51.145
Does it?

44:52.189 --> 44:54.774
Well,
that's interesting, Colonel,

44:54.858 --> 44:58.111
seeing as how
l just made up
those causes of death.

44:59.113 --> 45:02.240
l mean, there was no
accidental drowning

45:02.324 --> 45:04.575
and no mountain climbing fall.

45:05.953 --> 45:08.371
l do have the details
of these tragic deaths

45:08.455 --> 45:10.790
including a fatal
home-invasion robbery,

45:10.874 --> 45:12.917
if you'd care
to look at them.

45:14.586 --> 45:17.547
l'm a little fuzzy
on the details.

45:17.631 --> 45:18.965
l wasn't in charge of
those investigations.

45:19.049 --> 45:21.175
No further questions,
Colonel.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.301
My investigation was
strictly by the book.

45:22.386 --> 45:24.095
No further questions.

45:27.474 --> 45:28.558
Hello?

45:28.642 --> 45:30.143
Claire,
it's Charlie.

45:30.269 --> 45:32.437
You know
the witness in Tom's unit
who was murdered?

45:32.479 --> 45:34.272
Yeah, home-invasion robbery.

45:34.356 --> 45:37.066
He was killed
right in front of his wife.

45:37.151 --> 45:41.195
And the word is,
she accused the military
of having been involved.

45:41.822 --> 45:43.448
Will she talk to us?

45:43.532 --> 45:46.743
Problem there is
that she disappeared
right after that.

46:04.845 --> 46:06.763
Hey. ls this a bad time?
Hey.

46:06.847 --> 46:08.431
A bad time? No.

46:08.807 --> 46:11.184
l was thinking
we could go over
the Hernandez cross.

46:11.268 --> 46:12.935
Well, l was just
taking a break,

46:13.020 --> 46:17.231
'cause, l was going over
the Hernandez stuff myself,
and. . .

46:20.736 --> 46:23.446
Please don't be mad.
lt wasn't him.
lt was all me.

46:23.530 --> 46:24.781
Mrs. Kubik,
l want you to know

46:24.865 --> 46:26.365
this doesn't
affect anything,
okay?

46:26.450 --> 46:29.827
l mean, my work.
l'm totally up for it.

46:31.538 --> 46:32.747
He is.

46:32.831 --> 46:36.125
Come on, Claire,
we were just
going over his briefs.

46:39.171 --> 46:40.129
Claire, wait.

46:40.214 --> 46:42.924
You never can take
anything seriously,
can you? Nothing, ever.

46:43.008 --> 46:45.384
Yeah, that's right, Claire.

46:45.552 --> 46:46.803
You know,
you get to be the lawyer,

46:46.887 --> 46:49.305
so l gotta get to
bang one, right?

47:31.431 --> 47:33.975
We're closed. Closed !

47:39.481 --> 47:40.481
Sorry, lady,
we're closed.

47:40.566 --> 47:41.524
Excuse me.

47:41.608 --> 47:43.860
Can you tell me
how to get to State Street?

47:43.944 --> 47:45.194
Sure. Two blocks down.

47:45.279 --> 47:46.320
Thank you.

47:46.405 --> 47:47.572
Sorry.

48:04.131 --> 48:05.840
Want some cheese?

48:07.301 --> 48:08.968
Yeah, l could make
an omelet.

48:09.052 --> 48:13.514
l'll make one.
You want cheddar?
American? Swiss?

48:13.974 --> 48:16.058
Cheddar's good.

48:16.143 --> 48:17.560
Mrs. Chapman?

48:20.772 --> 48:21.939
lt's Kubik.

48:22.024 --> 48:23.149
Okay, Mrs. Kubik.

48:23.233 --> 48:25.234
l want to tell you
about what
l do for a living.

48:25.319 --> 48:28.279
This sicko bothering you?
'Cause l know how
to deal with weirdos

48:28.363 --> 48:30.364
who hang around
the frozen food section.

48:30.449 --> 48:32.700
l teach guys
to beat the box.

48:33.660 --> 48:35.036
Who are you?

48:35.120 --> 48:38.080
l teach techniques
that enable anyone
to beat a polygraph,

48:38.165 --> 48:40.875
like special
operations personnel

48:40.959 --> 48:44.045
who might be captured,
interrogated
behind enemy lines.

48:44.713 --> 48:47.840
Basically, l teach people
to create a new persona.

48:48.842 --> 48:52.345
That way, when they lie,
they're not really lying.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.390
Why are you telling me this?

48:56.475 --> 48:57.767
l don't know.

48:57.851 --> 48:59.268
But my guess is, you do.

48:59.353 --> 49:01.562
Hey, who are you?
Who sent you?

49:01.647 --> 49:03.731
l was just asked
to convey this
message to you.

49:03.815 --> 49:06.692
Just so you'd know,
along with everyone else.

49:07.277 --> 49:08.694
Good night, Mrs. Kubik.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.363
Okay, get out of here.

49:21.416 --> 49:23.334
Hey, honey.

49:23.418 --> 49:24.877
ls it true?

49:25.963 --> 49:27.254
What?

49:27.339 --> 49:30.633
That you get that
kind of training,
to beat the box?

49:31.051 --> 49:32.093
What are you talking about?

49:32.177 --> 49:34.220
The polygraph, Tom.

49:35.764 --> 49:39.350
Sure,
but l didn't beat the box.
l told the truth.

49:39.434 --> 49:42.103
Why didn't you tell me
you could do that?

49:42.187 --> 49:43.813
'Cause it just didn't
occur to me.

49:43.897 --> 49:46.065
That's not a part
of who l am anymore.

49:46.149 --> 49:49.443
Well, that's it, isn't it?
That's it right there.

49:49.528 --> 49:50.945
How do l know
who you are?

49:51.029 --> 49:54.448
Claire, you're the only one
who knows who l am.

50:01.123 --> 50:04.041
You know what?
That's it. l. . .

50:09.006 --> 50:12.133
l don't care anymore.
l did it.

50:12.592 --> 50:14.635
l shot them all. Yeah.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.179
For the fun of it. Why not?

50:17.264 --> 50:19.223
Who the hell cares, Claire?

50:19.307 --> 50:21.976
You know, the man you've been
waking up to every morning

50:22.060 --> 50:26.439
loves,
just loves to kill women
and children in cold blood.

50:27.607 --> 50:31.444
'Cause l. . .
Who the hell knows why,
Claire?

50:31.528 --> 50:33.446
Am l making any sense?

50:34.948 --> 50:37.908
Does what l'm saying
make any sense to you?

50:39.453 --> 50:40.453
No.

50:57.804 --> 50:59.972
This whole base
ain't secure.

51:02.225 --> 51:04.643
They know every move we make.

51:12.819 --> 51:15.237
Tell me.
How do they know, Charlie?

51:15.322 --> 51:16.697
How do they know?

51:16.782 --> 51:19.658
Good question, Mrs. Kubik.
Good question.

51:55.153 --> 51:56.320
Damn, Charlie Grimes.

51:56.404 --> 51:57.446
Hey, Renny.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.198
lt's been ages.

52:00.951 --> 52:02.952
Did you come to
beg for leftovers?

52:03.036 --> 52:07.665
No, l just want
to look through
your trash. Okay?

52:10.544 --> 52:12.711
White shroud

52:15.507 --> 52:18.759
Clear blue sky

52:20.804 --> 52:24.890
The sea swells a bit

52:26.059 --> 52:29.687
When sailors die

52:32.524 --> 52:35.067
Was that a word?

52:37.237 --> 52:40.698
ls this a clue?

52:43.410 --> 52:46.954
You're so very far away

52:48.290 --> 52:51.750
But l'm sure it's you

53:15.984 --> 53:19.570
What's the problem?
Take it easy. God damn !

53:28.163 --> 53:30.206
Hold his legs.
No. No.

53:30.290 --> 53:31.373
Hold him.

53:31.458 --> 53:32.833
No, no, please.

53:35.253 --> 53:36.879
Come on, come on.

53:41.468 --> 53:43.886
l just don't believe it.
l refuse.

53:44.596 --> 53:45.804
And my sister-in-law
used to say

53:45.889 --> 53:48.140
truth is less fun
than fiction.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.558
Terry would never do that.

53:49.643 --> 53:51.685
You're screwing him,
so you know him?

53:51.770 --> 53:53.604
Excuse me,
Mrs. Ron Chapman.

53:53.688 --> 53:54.897
l gotta sit down.

54:02.239 --> 54:03.781
Well, well, well.

54:03.865 --> 54:05.032
What happened?

54:05.116 --> 54:08.744
Lucy, you got a lot
of explaining to do.

54:08.828 --> 54:11.413
Charlie, you all right?
Who did this?

54:11.498 --> 54:14.458
Just some of the old gang
from down at the club,

54:14.542 --> 54:18.212
the same group
that mysteriously knows
every move we make.

54:19.214 --> 54:20.256
What are you talking about?

54:20.340 --> 54:22.341
How did they know
about the polygraph?

54:22.425 --> 54:23.592
Tarot cards?

54:24.552 --> 54:26.303
Were you with them?
Were you drinking
with Waldron?

54:26.388 --> 54:28.555
Wait a minute. Every Friday
everybody drinks there.

54:28.640 --> 54:30.307
We don't talk about cases.

54:31.643 --> 54:32.810
Charlie,
you were in the Corps.

54:32.894 --> 54:35.020
You know
what it's like, right?

54:36.189 --> 54:37.731
Claire, you can understand.

54:37.816 --> 54:39.400
l understand you're fired.

54:39.484 --> 54:41.694
What? No, listen.

54:41.778 --> 54:44.488
This case will be over,
and you'll be gone,
but l'll still be here.

54:44.572 --> 54:45.656
Did you know about this?

54:45.740 --> 54:47.116
What? Wait a minute.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.326
Did you? Did you know
about the attack
on me and Claire?

54:49.411 --> 54:50.619
Or was it just
a coincidence. . .

54:50.704 --> 54:53.122
What? You seriously
think l would do. . .

55:12.350 --> 55:14.018
What do you say
we go to the hospital,
Charlie?

55:14.102 --> 55:15.728
l'm worried
about your ribs.

55:15.812 --> 55:18.814
Just get me some ice.
Hell, l've been here before.

55:18.898 --> 55:21.275
And l won't be there
for Hernandez.

55:21.359 --> 55:22.693
l got word.

55:22.777 --> 55:24.653
Troy Abbott got his parole.

55:26.072 --> 55:27.614
l gotta go track him down.

55:28.867 --> 55:31.493
Well,
kind of sick.

55:31.578 --> 55:33.370
See, Chapman taunted
the victims.

55:33.455 --> 55:35.748
He tossed his gun
around like a cowboy,

55:36.499 --> 55:38.459
kind of showing off,
and then

55:38.668 --> 55:39.918
he executed them.

55:43.048 --> 55:45.090
Please continue, Major.

55:46.593 --> 55:49.261
l ran to the south
end of the village,
but it was too late.

55:50.096 --> 55:53.599
They were all dead.
Chapman was still shooting.

55:57.103 --> 55:58.771
Chapman !

55:59.773 --> 56:01.607
Two other members of the unit
assisted me,

56:01.691 --> 56:03.901
and we got him down,
we got his weapon.

56:08.656 --> 56:12.242
Major, you say
Sergeant Chapman
did some sick things.

56:12.786 --> 56:16.663
Yet you, his XO,
allowed him to proceed
without any supervision?

56:16.831 --> 56:19.333
l didn't realize
he'd take it that far.

56:19.417 --> 56:23.003
Had Chapman ever been
cited for this kind of
behavior before?

56:23.088 --> 56:25.047
No, he had not.
ln fact, wasn't he

56:25.131 --> 56:28.634
the most experienced
and reliable member
of Detachment 27?

56:28.802 --> 56:32.679
Before you answer,
that's a direct quote
from a report you filed.

56:32.764 --> 56:35.140
Defense exhibit A.

56:35.225 --> 56:36.934
Chapman was a good Marine.

56:37.018 --> 56:39.395
Courageous. Honest.

56:39.479 --> 56:40.562
l thought so.

56:40.647 --> 56:42.648
The kind of good
Marine who would not

56:42.732 --> 56:44.650
go along with a cover-up. . .
Objection.

56:44.734 --> 56:46.735
. . .for you who actually
committed the killing.

56:46.820 --> 56:47.903
Objection !

56:47.987 --> 56:48.987
Sustained.

56:49.072 --> 56:52.074
Make that your last outburst,
Counselor.

56:52.158 --> 56:56.578
Jury members,
you are instructed to
disregard that accusation.

56:56.663 --> 57:01.041
Major, how is it
possible that seven men,
spread all over a village,

57:01.126 --> 57:03.669
would witness
the exact same thing?

57:03.753 --> 57:06.255
We all got to the barn
at the same time.

57:06.339 --> 57:09.383
Wow. How convenient.

57:10.802 --> 57:13.929
Doesn't it make more sense
that some of those
alleged witnesses

57:14.013 --> 57:16.932
were ordered to lie
on their C. l. D. statements?

57:17.016 --> 57:18.851
They were not ordered to lie.
How do you know?

57:18.935 --> 57:21.270
l would know if
something like that
happened to my men.

57:21.354 --> 57:23.147
And if
something like that
happened to your men,

57:23.231 --> 57:24.273
you would tell us?

57:24.357 --> 57:26.733
Of course.
l wouldn't lie about it.

57:26.818 --> 57:28.944
But, Major,

57:29.028 --> 57:30.571
you were trained
and often compelled

57:30.655 --> 57:32.823
to lie about your
clandestine missions.

57:32.907 --> 57:37.369
As l understand it,
you're trained to
beat a polygraph.

57:39.330 --> 57:41.498
ls it true you
possess that talent?

57:42.250 --> 57:45.669
l'd only use it
if interrogated
by the enemy, ma'am.

57:45.753 --> 57:48.213
That's good to know.

57:48.298 --> 57:50.215
So, tell me this, Major.

57:51.468 --> 57:53.677
Do you consider me a friend?

58:11.404 --> 58:13.197
Hey.
Hey.

58:13.281 --> 58:14.281
l ain't done
nothing with her.

58:14.365 --> 58:16.325
l ain't interested
if there's gonna
be pimps involved.

58:16.409 --> 58:19.953
No, no. You got that
all wrong, brother.
That ain't me.

58:20.038 --> 58:22.331
Shit. l should be so lucky.

58:22.415 --> 58:26.835
No, l'm just supposed
to deliver this
to Troy Abbott.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.587
That you?
Yeah. Who from?

58:28.671 --> 58:31.048
lt's from Jimmy Hernandez,
down at the base.

58:31.174 --> 58:32.925
Hey, Charles.

58:33.801 --> 58:35.511
Grace,
what are you doing here?

58:35.595 --> 58:36.887
Got a call from the base.

58:36.971 --> 58:38.555
You got a call
from the base?
Yup.

58:38.640 --> 58:40.265
Bullshit
you got this call !

58:40.350 --> 58:41.391
l got this. . .
What, bitch?

58:41.476 --> 58:43.685
Who you raising up?
Get up!

58:43.770 --> 58:46.939
l'm gonna whup
your nasty ass self!

58:47.023 --> 58:48.065
Stop! Stop! Stop!

58:48.149 --> 58:49.691
l'm tired of this shit!

58:49.776 --> 58:51.527
Why are you always
getting into trouble?

58:51.611 --> 58:53.695
Why you always
trying to play daddy?

58:53.780 --> 58:55.030
Apologize to the man.

58:55.114 --> 58:56.865
l ain't. . .

59:01.204 --> 59:03.330
Do you want me
to apologize, baby?

59:06.918 --> 59:08.669
Do you?

59:10.463 --> 59:12.839
Gracie can
apologize real good.

59:14.676 --> 59:16.635
Do you?

59:18.137 --> 59:21.098
Do you want me
to say sorry?
l'm sorry.

59:22.475 --> 59:24.393
So they paroled you?

59:24.477 --> 59:25.727
Yeah.

59:25.812 --> 59:28.689
Then they bring me
all the way to
this dump to testify.

59:28.773 --> 59:31.608
Why? What really
happened that night?

59:31.693 --> 59:34.027
Hey, l don't know, man.
lt was years ago.

59:34.112 --> 59:36.655
El Salvador.
Some massacre shit.

59:37.490 --> 59:40.867
l'll bet
some damn officer
ordered it too, right?

59:42.996 --> 59:44.746
You ain't thirsty?

59:44.831 --> 59:46.623
Yeah. Shit, yeah.

59:46.708 --> 59:49.710
l'm just, you know,
just chilling.

59:52.714 --> 59:55.674
They call me Dr. John

59:56.759 --> 59:58.385
Known as the night tripper

59:59.512 --> 01:00:03.765
My satchel of
Gris-Gris in my hand

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:07.394
Day trippin' up

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.522
Back down the bayou

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.275
l'm the last of the best

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.694
l'm known as the Gris-Gris man

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.113
Sellin'

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:21.575
Gris-Gris Gumbo Ya-Ya

01:00:21.659 --> 01:00:23.201
Hit it now

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:26.538
Hey, now...

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:34.129
So then what
did you say back?
That's like. . .

01:00:34.213 --> 01:00:35.797
Yeah, what'd you say?

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:37.549
Come on, tell us.
We never get to
hear shit like this.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.134
Come on. Damn, man.

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:40.594
All right, hey, hey.
Who we gonna tell,

01:00:40.678 --> 01:00:42.638
you know what l'm saying?

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:44.681
What'd you say?

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:47.142
That l was
nowhere near
the place.

01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:50.896
And they want me to say
that l saw this guy shooting.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.815
Damn.
That's intense.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.983
You gonna do it?

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:57.819
Hell, l already did it
in my statement to the C. l. D.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:00.947
l just gotta testify
to what l already said,
you know?

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:03.116
What's C. l. D.?

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:06.161
Criminal
lnvestigative Division.

01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:08.330
Yeah,
but what about
this poor guy?

01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:11.041
Forget the poor guy.

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:13.960
l mean,
what are you gonna do?
Your XO comes up, says,

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:18.131
"You see Chapman
shoot the wetbacks?"
You say, "No, sir, l didn't."

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:22.844
He says, "Be sure about this.
Your career's on the line."

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.596
Everybody else
said he did it.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.515
So l say
what they want to hear.

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:29.518
One more witness,
no difference. Right?

01:01:31.729 --> 01:01:33.105
Right.

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:56.813
91 1 . What is your
address and emergency?

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:58.774
Yes. 1 01 45. Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:00.609
All right, ma'am.
ls this an emergency?

01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:03.570
No, there's somebody
trying to get in the house.

01:03:03.654 --> 01:03:05.572
Claire?

01:03:05.656 --> 01:03:06.782
Hello? ls he in?

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:08.158
No. No, no.
lt's okay.
l'm sorry.

01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:09.451
Claire, open the door.

01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:10.577
False alarm?
Claire?

01:03:10.661 --> 01:03:11.912
Yeah, it was a false alarm.

01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:13.747
Thanks.

01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:15.040
Claire?

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:20.086
Charlie,
you scared me to death.

01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:21.546
That guy was out there.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.007
What guy?

01:03:24.091 --> 01:03:25.258
You've been drinking.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:26.384
Who, me?

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.636
Oh, my God.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.471
No. No, no.
You got it wrong.

01:03:29.555 --> 01:03:30.764
See, l'm just a victim

01:03:30.848 --> 01:03:33.183
of hazardous
working conditions.
Frightful life.

01:03:33.267 --> 01:03:35.018
Sure you are.
No, really.

01:03:35.102 --> 01:03:36.728
That man was
watching the house.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.772
No. Ain't nobody out there.

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:47.322
What is this?
What is this?

01:03:47.406 --> 01:03:49.032
Looks like a recorder.

01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:50.116
Hmm.

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.327
ls Abbott on here,

01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:56.581
saying he never saw
what he agreed to
testify to in court?

01:03:57.708 --> 01:03:58.708
You didn't?

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:01.837
l most certainly did.
And you know what?

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.964
He was nowhere
near the shooting.

01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:06.925
l mean, nowhere near it.

01:04:09.053 --> 01:04:11.263
Charlie, this is fabulous.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.433
This does it.
This proves they're
setting him up.

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:20.605
Charlie, l. . .

01:04:23.067 --> 01:04:28.321
You really think
l wanted to give up
483 days of sobriety

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:32.158
and start all over
at day one, Claire?

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:39.207
l'll make some coffee.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:43.003
Wait a minute.
Not so fast.
See, l figure,

01:04:43.087 --> 01:04:45.213
"Hey,
you already slipped,
Charlie.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:49.384
"So what's one
more gonna hurt?"
How about it, Claire?

01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:50.677
One for our side.

01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:53.430
l can't. l'm trying
to get pregnant.

01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:58.268
Well.

01:04:58.352 --> 01:05:01.313
l'm not trying
to get pregnant.

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.732
l am certainly not
trying to get pregnant.

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:13.325
You're absolutely right,

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.160
but a judge will be
more lenient.

01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:26.546
You're late, Counsel.

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:28.340
Prosecution
requests a sidebar.

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:30.675
Make it good.

01:05:34.138 --> 01:05:36.723
Your Honor, our next witness,
Troy Abbott, has disappeared.

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:38.099
What?
Things are gone
from his room.

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:39.267
Now, we've
notified the MPs. . .

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:40.852
Notified, my ass.
You let him out of jail,

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:41.937
and you turned him loose.
Watch your language.

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:44.189
Your Honor, we have a tape
that impeaches Abbott's
original statement

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:45.607
and fully vindicates
our client.
What tape?

01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:46.650
There was no discovery
about a tape.

01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:48.068
Why, you with discovery.
You got spies all over.

01:05:48.152 --> 01:05:49.653
ln my chambers,
everybody.

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:51.446
Court is recessed.

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:52.989
All rise!

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:02.165
l mean, what are you gonna do?
Your XO comes up, says,

01:06:02.249 --> 01:06:06.169
"You see Chapman
shoot the wetbacks?"
You say, "No, sir, l didn't."

01:06:06.253 --> 01:06:10.799
He says, "Be sure about this.
Your career's on the line."

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:13.760
Everybody else
said he did it.

01:06:13.844 --> 01:06:15.804
So l say what
they want to hear.

01:06:15.888 --> 01:06:18.848
One more witness,
no difference. Right?

01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:39.244
Without Abbott,
we can't authenticate
this tape.

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:41.287
For all we know,
he may have been
coerced,

01:06:41.372 --> 01:06:43.164
any number of things.

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:45.041
lt's inadmissible.
What?

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:47.961
Your Honor,
you admitted Abbott's
C. l. D. statement.

01:06:48.045 --> 01:06:49.838
We need this to rebut it.

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:52.424
This tape clearly
exonerates Ron Chapman.

01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:55.343
The C. l. D. statement
was taken by
an objective party.

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:58.013
Bullshit! He lied !

01:06:58.097 --> 01:06:59.848
They lied !
How the hell is
that objective?

01:06:59.932 --> 01:07:01.516
The tape is excluded.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.559
What's next?

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:03.727
Your Honor!

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:06.479
Excluded, Counselor.

01:07:08.941 --> 01:07:10.442
Major?

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:15.280
We're out of witnesses,
Your Honor.
The prosecution rests.

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:17.032
Your Honor,
this is a capital case.

01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:19.909
An objective judge
would admit the tape,
and you know it.

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:22.287
We'll hear from
the defense next Friday.

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:24.497
This is grounds
for an appeal.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:36.760
Honey?

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.053
Claire. . .
We'll appeal this.

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:40.096
Claire, stop.
You can't fight them.

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:41.723
Tom, don't talk that way.

01:07:41.807 --> 01:07:43.099
We'll get another break.
l know we will.

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:45.226
You do not know
these people.

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:48.229
Stop it before you
get yourself hurt.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:49.731
We can win this.

01:07:49.815 --> 01:07:52.025
l am not gonna let
them do this to you.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.246
What are you doing?

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:12.295
ls that a. . .

01:08:12.379 --> 01:08:15.590
Must have done it
when they installed
the phones.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:24.057
And you two were
so ready to blame Terry.
So self-righteous.

01:08:26.018 --> 01:08:28.435
Let's go to Farrell,
demand a mistrial.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.814
Denied. There's no way
we'd ever be able to prove

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:34.943
that Waldron or Hernandez
had anything at all
to do with this.

01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:36.194
Then what?

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.827
We are out of witnesses,
and we are out of time.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.830
Maybe it's time
we heard from
the brigadier general.

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:48.331
Not on the stand.

01:08:48.415 --> 01:08:49.791
No.

01:08:49.875 --> 01:08:51.501
You think we should
pay him a visit?

01:08:51.585 --> 01:08:53.711
l think you should
pay him a visit.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:57.048
Why me?
Are you scared of him?

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:03.220
No, but l'm just a thorn
in the Marine Corps' ass.

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:08.059
But you, my dear,

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:12.479
you're the pretty, young,
sympathetic little wife.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:14.023
l don't play those games.

01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:19.069
Shit.

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:34.836
General Marks?

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.129
No press, please.

01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:37.212
l'm not press.
How do you do?

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:38.298
Miss. . .

01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:39.841
Kubik. Claire Kubik.

01:09:39.925 --> 01:09:42.760
l'm representing my husband,
Sergeant Ron Chapman?

01:09:44.095 --> 01:09:46.805
Mrs. Kubik. Good day.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:48.683
General Marks,
you gave James Hernandez. . .

01:09:48.767 --> 01:09:49.893
l have nothing to say to you.
. . .the order

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:53.688
to eliminate Danilo Chacon
and his terrorist
group at Las Colinas.

01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:57.775
You knew they fully
expected Detachment 27
to come under attack.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.194
You're a dignified man, sir.

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:01.029
End the cover-up.

01:10:01.113 --> 01:10:02.197
How dare you?

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:04.699
Your man James Hernandez
overreacted and opened fire.

01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:05.825
You know what happened.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.161
Young lady,
you are way out of line.

01:10:08.245 --> 01:10:11.789
Listen to this, sir,
and tell me
how out of line l am.

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.558
This is C.W. Grimes
and Associates.

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:32.018
lf you want to
talk to Charlie,

01:10:32.102 --> 01:10:34.062
you should
leave a message
after the beep.

01:10:34.146 --> 01:10:35.647
lf you want to
talk to Delilah,

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:36.773
you should get
your head examined.

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:39.234
Well, Charlie,
that was a great idea.

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:41.569
The man flicked
me off his suit
like l was a flea.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.029
l am gonna lose my mind.

01:10:43.113 --> 01:10:45.448
l mean,
we cannot let them
get away with this.

01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:48.743
There has to be
somebody who was there.

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:51.996
There has to be
somebody who's. . .

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:04.217
Directory assistance.

01:11:04.301 --> 01:11:05.343
The Herald.

01:11:05.886 --> 01:11:07.345
Of course not.

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:10.682
When you settle down,
l do have something to say.

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:13.309
You're
representing your own husband
in the court-martial?

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:14.769
ls there
a military conspiracy
at work here?

01:11:14.853 --> 01:11:17.230
You know
that l cannot
legally comment on

01:11:17.314 --> 01:11:19.565
the details of
a court-martial proceeding.

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.109
l would, however,
like to say,

01:11:21.193 --> 01:11:23.695
emphatically,
that my husband is innocent.

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:28.074
There is a man
who's a stranger to me,
who said to me last week

01:11:28.158 --> 01:11:30.535
that all lawyers
are a waste of oxygen.

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:34.289
As a wife and as an attorney,
l greatly fear
that justice in this case

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:35.999
will not
ultimately be served,

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.334
and l would like to
challenge that man

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.295
or anyone who has
firsthand knowledge

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:43.381
of what happened
that day in El Salvador
to please come forward.

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:44.465
Charlie?

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:45.633
Laurel, just to recap

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:48.344
today's press conference
with attorney Claire Kubik,

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:52.056
she's continually insisting
that her husband is innocent.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:56.477
This attorney and wife
is clearly
standing by her man.

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:59.731
Reporting live
for Channel 1 2 News,
this is Karen Cobb.

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:28.926
Hello?

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.011
You just had to do it.
You just had to.

01:12:30.095 --> 01:12:32.180
The whole firm
just saw you on
the 6:00 news.

01:12:32.264 --> 01:12:34.974
Hello, Alex.
l have been expecting your. . .

01:12:38.228 --> 01:12:42.065
Claire?

01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:43.608
l'll. . .

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:46.152
You'll. . .

01:12:46.236 --> 01:12:48.529
l'll send you
my resignation tomorrow.

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:49.947
Claire?

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:08.383
Get in.

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:09.675
No.

01:13:15.432 --> 01:13:18.351
Wait. Okay, wait. No.

01:13:33.325 --> 01:13:35.451
Where are we going?

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:43.376
l want to know the truth.

01:13:47.297 --> 01:13:49.841
l want to know
what happened
at Las Colinas.

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:03.229
You don't care
about the truth.

01:14:03.313 --> 01:14:06.524
All you care about is
saving your husband.

01:14:45.689 --> 01:14:46.898
Get out.

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:49.734
Get out.

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:04.957
You want to know
about Las Colinas?

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:08.169
Women like you,

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:12.423
beautiful, young,

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:21.807
and the old people
begging for their lives.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.615
Jesus Christ.

01:15:40.118 --> 01:15:41.702
lt was 1 2 years ago.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:43.579
They all look the same,
a bunch of
gringos in uniform. . .

01:15:43.664 --> 01:15:44.705
Don't be foolish.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.123
lt's a photograph.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.169
l just want to
show you a photograph.

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:08.437
l remember him,
the one with
the patch on his eye,

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:11.607
the blood still fresh from
the explosion at Monte Azul.

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:13.526
This man was
at Monte Azul?

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:14.819
Of course he was.

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:16.862
He killed Danilo Chacon.

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:21.784
Chacon was in the café
in a secret meeting

01:16:21.868 --> 01:16:24.745
and this man was there.
He was there.

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:29.709
That's how he hurt his eye.

01:16:30.335 --> 01:16:32.545
No, but Danilo Chacon
blew up the café

01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:33.879
and killed the three
American students. . .

01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:38.050
You people believe anything.
The students were killed
by mistake,

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:40.970
because the American military
didn't know they were there.

01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:44.515
To cover it up,
they blamed the rebels

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.101
and pretended to
look for their leader
in Las Colinas,

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:50.646
but they knew
he was already dead.

01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:52.857
They knew
they had killed
him with the bomb.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:17.548
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.

01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:44.825
Well, if it isn't
little Miss Six O'Clock News.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.494
You're drunk.

01:17:46.578 --> 01:17:49.497
You were supposed
to call me, but. . .

01:17:49.581 --> 01:17:51.499
When you got. . .
Charlie?

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:53.417
l called you.

01:17:55.253 --> 01:17:57.046
l was out, but you
could have called back.

01:17:57.130 --> 01:17:59.590
l thought we had
an agreement.

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:04.220
Excuse me.
l thought we had
an agreement.

01:18:04.304 --> 01:18:05.805
l thought. . .

01:18:05.889 --> 01:18:07.556
l thought me and
you was partners.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:08.724
But you know,
partners don't

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:10.267
decide to do dumb shit. . .
Charlie, it worked.

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:11.686
. . .without telling
the other part of the team

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:13.062
that they'd done
some dumb shit.

01:18:13.146 --> 01:18:15.022
Charlie?
What?

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:17.775
l just spent
an hour with the guy.

01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:21.362
He's the real deal.
He saw the whole thing.

01:18:21.446 --> 01:18:24.365
Tom's innocent.
This proves it.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.200
There's a cover-up,
Charlie,

01:18:26.284 --> 01:18:28.244
and it's bigger
than we thought.

01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:30.746
l need you sober.

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:33.374
Yeah.

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:34.500
Come on.

01:18:34.584 --> 01:18:36.335
Yeah, all right.
Let's get you home.

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.504
Okay, baby. All right.

01:18:38.588 --> 01:18:41.549
No, Charlie.

01:18:41.633 --> 01:18:42.883
Chris, last one.

01:18:42.968 --> 01:18:44.719
Just one more.
Forget about it.

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:47.388
l got it. l got it.

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:52.852
Come on, partner.

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:00.651
All right, partner.

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:31.807
Damn, what was that?

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:37.229
What? Oh, my God !

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:43.319
Shit! lt's oil !

01:20:32.035 --> 01:20:33.786
Hi, sweetie.

01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:42.670
l had the worst dream.

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:48.008
l dreamt l was pregnant
and these people came
and took the baby away.

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:51.178
You one lucky girl,

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:53.556
you and the gentleman.

01:20:55.141 --> 01:20:57.601
l want you to
take something.

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.106
Here, baby.

01:21:08.613 --> 01:21:11.240
Don't you worry
about a thing.

01:21:11.324 --> 01:21:12.950
You'll have another baby.

01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:17.913
What?

01:21:19.332 --> 01:21:21.375
Don't you worry.
What?

01:21:21.459 --> 01:21:23.127
You'll have another one.

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:27.923
Jackie?

01:21:30.343 --> 01:21:32.553
No. No.

01:21:32.637 --> 01:21:33.888
l'm so sorry.

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:36.849
No. No. No.
That's not fair.
No.

01:21:36.933 --> 01:21:38.434
l'm so sorry.

01:21:46.693 --> 01:21:49.778
Be strong. Be strong.
You have to rest.

01:22:05.503 --> 01:22:06.754
Claire,
it's Charlie.

01:22:06.838 --> 01:22:08.088
Come in.

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.386
Hi.

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:22.770
How's your neck?

01:22:22.854 --> 01:22:24.188
lt's all right.

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:25.439
l've had worse whiplash

01:22:25.523 --> 01:22:28.817
just looking around
at pretty women like you
on the street.

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.365
l'm truly sorry, Claire.

01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:41.497
l wanted that baby
so much, Charlie.

01:22:44.751 --> 01:22:47.002
You know,
l kept thinking,

01:22:48.713 --> 01:22:50.047
maybe there was
something wrong
with me,

01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:53.384
or l didn't deserve it,

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:55.135
or l wouldn't be
a good mother.

01:22:56.179 --> 01:22:58.889
l really didn't think
they'd do something
like this.

01:23:01.017 --> 01:23:02.810
l'm at zero, Charlie.

01:23:02.894 --> 01:23:05.229
Hey, whoa.
Whoa, now.
Listen to me.

01:23:05.897 --> 01:23:10.317
l know about zero.
l've hit bottom,

01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:14.530
and l was on
my way back there
before the accident.

01:23:14.614 --> 01:23:16.907
But you know what?

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:20.619
l think we were
spared for some reason,
and you gotta believe that.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:26.125
So, for you and me,
kiddo, this is day one.

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:28.585
Okay?

01:23:30.463 --> 01:23:33.757
Hey, you got
another visitor.

01:23:41.307 --> 01:23:42.850
Hello.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.769
Merry Christmas.

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:48.564
You all right?

01:23:49.482 --> 01:23:51.400
l owe you an apology,
Lieutenant.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.279
We were mistaken.

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:56.655
That's okay.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:00.534
Although, l'm not sure
merry is the right word
to use around here.

01:24:00.618 --> 01:24:04.455
Well, that's where
you might be wrong,
Mrs. Kubik.

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:08.000
You see,
if it's true James Hernandez

01:24:08.084 --> 01:24:10.210
injured his eye
in the bombing
at the café,

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:12.379
he would have got
immediate treatment
for it.

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:14.423
And they just keep records
of those covert operations

01:24:14.507 --> 01:24:16.175
so people like us
can go look them up?

01:24:16.259 --> 01:24:19.553
No,
he would have insisted on it
for insurance purposes,

01:24:19.637 --> 01:24:23.057
so the government
couldn't screw him
out of compensation.

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:37.529
Thank you.

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:39.031
Agent Mullins!

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:44.870
l just need
a minute of your time.

01:24:47.165 --> 01:24:48.874
Somehow l'm confident

01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:52.920
it's not my rugged good looks
to which l owe the honor
of this visit.

01:24:53.004 --> 01:24:55.631
The press accepted
the official version
of the story.

01:24:55.715 --> 01:24:57.758
Well, what if Chacon
didn't blow up the café?

01:24:57.842 --> 01:24:58.884
Mrs. Kubik. . .

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:01.595
What if James Hernandez,
the XO of my husband's unit,

01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:05.140
blew up the café
and killed the American
students by mistake?

01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:06.934
What if
Brigadier General Marks,

01:25:07.018 --> 01:25:10.270
to cover the whole thing up,
staged a raid on Las Colinas?

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:13.232
What if all this
is not my job and
none of my business?

01:25:13.316 --> 01:25:15.734
l'm just asking you
to help me look into it.

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:17.194
Make it a lean one, chief.

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:20.405
Why not?
l know you have
your sources.

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:21.865
My sources?

01:25:21.908 --> 01:25:23.826
You keep saying
it's not your job.
Good.

01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:25.452
l wasn't sure
you were listening.

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:28.122
Well, Agent Mullins,
then whose job is it?

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:38.006
Come on, whose job?

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:41.510
God damn,
what a pain in the ass
you are.

01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:45.472
Hernandez was
injured in the explosion.

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:48.934
There has got to be
a classified medical
document somewhere.

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:06.410
Yeah?

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:07.661
Hey, Charlie,
it's me, man.

01:26:07.745 --> 01:26:09.538
Hey, Mac.
l've been
checking out the rumors

01:26:09.622 --> 01:26:12.166
about how those witnesses
in Chapman's unit really died.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:13.333
Hell, l've been all
over the place, man.

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:15.627
l got expenses,
phone bills,
plane tickets.

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:17.129
lt's gonna cost you, man.
lt's gonna cost you.

01:26:17.213 --> 01:26:18.338
Well, you told me that.

01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:20.799
l found the wife
of the one who was murdered.

01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:23.218
Lisa Stenstrom is
living in Mexico,

01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:26.680
and she swears
the military
killed her husband.

01:26:26.764 --> 01:26:27.764
Yeah?

01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:30.475
Just inside, ma'am.

01:27:13.811 --> 01:27:15.312
Have you heard
from Charlie?

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:17.731
Yeah.
He called about an hour ago,
but he was really weird,

01:27:17.815 --> 01:27:19.566
like he didn't want
to talk on the phone.

01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:20.901
Well,
like Charlie,
l don't know

01:27:20.985 --> 01:27:22.569
if l should talk
on the phone.

01:27:22.654 --> 01:27:24.404
He did say he was in Mexico.

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:27.115
ln Mexico?
What is he doing in Mexico?

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.784
l don't know.
So you're on your way
back here or what?

01:27:28.868 --> 01:27:30.619
Yeah, but l'm gonna stop
in Los Angeles first.

01:27:30.703 --> 01:27:31.745
All right. Bye.

01:27:31.829 --> 01:27:32.913
So, l'll see you.

01:27:47.178 --> 01:27:49.596
General.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:52.641
You all have
had him all night.
lt's my turn.

01:27:52.725 --> 01:27:54.268
Shall we?

01:27:58.898 --> 01:28:03.318
We uncovered the real reason
you sent Detachment 27
to Las Colinas.

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:05.529
Uncovered?
lt's a matter of
public record.

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:07.114
Well, not really.

01:28:07.198 --> 01:28:08.365
What is a matter
of record, though,

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:10.200
is that James Hernandez
sustained an injury

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:12.786
to his left eye
in the bombing
at Monte Azul.

01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:14.162
Eyewitnesses place him
in the truck

01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:16.331
from which
the grenade was thrown,

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:19.084
and he had that injury treated
at a hospital in San Salvador,

01:28:19.168 --> 01:28:21.545
before Las Colinas.

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:25.257
Your gung ho raid
was a decoy
for your bombing.

01:28:26.384 --> 01:28:28.844
You know,
this fairy tale of yours

01:28:28.928 --> 01:28:31.430
would have to be based
on classified material,

01:28:31.514 --> 01:28:34.933
even if any of it
were remotely possible.

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:38.520
Now, you're bluffing,
and you're doing it badly.

01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:42.899
After you.
Thank you.

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.492
You know,
General Marks,
we'd be only

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:54.870
too happy to have
you testify under oath

01:28:54.954 --> 01:28:58.206
and allow
the court to fully
explore our evidence.

01:28:59.709 --> 01:29:03.003
For example,
classified document
dated 3-1 4-88.

01:29:03.087 --> 01:29:05.339
Major Hernandez's
medical report

01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:08.300
for a shrapnel wound
at Santa Maria hospital.

01:29:08.384 --> 01:29:11.094
You know,
that's the same day and
mighty close to Monte Azul.

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:21.188
You have no shame.

01:29:21.272 --> 01:29:24.358
Look what
you're willing to do
to free a murderer.

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:25.942
Pick up the phone
and call the right people.

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:28.153
l want the charges dropped
or the document goes public.

01:29:28.237 --> 01:29:30.072
Haven't you noticed

01:29:30.156 --> 01:29:32.657
that you've been
unlucky lately?

01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:37.371
Now, caution might be
the order of the day
for you.

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:40.207
l am not afraid of you.

01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:43.377
l've already
survived you once,
you smug son of a bitch.

01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:46.546
The real question is
will you survive me?

01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:51.385
Make it go away, General,
or the document goes public.

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:00.394
For both our sakes, sir.

01:30:23.459 --> 01:30:25.293
Pull over, right here.

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:32.551
Jackie. Jackie?

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:35.971
Jackie?

01:30:42.019 --> 01:30:43.270
Ma'am.

01:30:43.354 --> 01:30:44.438
Claire?

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:46.690
You all right?

01:30:46.816 --> 01:30:48.567
Oh, my God. Yeah.

01:30:51.028 --> 01:30:52.446
What the hell's
that all about?

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:55.323
Colonel Farrell wants
us in court tomorrow
morning at 0800.

01:30:56.742 --> 01:31:00.120
Waldron filed a motion
to have you disqualified
from the case

01:31:00.204 --> 01:31:02.622
for talking to the press.

01:31:03.749 --> 01:31:05.584
Any word from Charlie?

01:31:05.668 --> 01:31:07.127
l've been trying him
on his cell all day.

01:31:07.211 --> 01:31:09.671
Just getting voice mail.

01:31:13.843 --> 01:31:16.845
We've still got Hernandez's
medical report.

01:31:19.432 --> 01:31:21.975
l'll do my best.

01:31:22.059 --> 01:31:23.852
Farrell wouldn't admit
a classified document

01:31:23.936 --> 01:31:26.396
any more than he would
the Abbott tape.

01:31:28.232 --> 01:31:30.233
Maybe you should
take the deal.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:33.278
There's no more deal,
not now.

01:31:41.245 --> 01:31:43.330
l'm sorry, Mrs. Kubik.

01:31:43.414 --> 01:31:45.957
Why don't you
spend the night out?

01:31:46.042 --> 01:31:49.294
l don't know if
it's a good idea to be
around here tonight.

01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:53.131
l. . .

01:31:55.551 --> 01:31:58.053
l could use
a little time
on my own.

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:31.586
Hey. You heard from Charlie?

01:32:31.671 --> 01:32:32.837
No.

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:43.473
What's going on, honey?

01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:45.141
l don't know.

01:32:47.103 --> 01:32:48.812
All rise.

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:01.324
Be seated.

01:33:04.829 --> 01:33:07.664
Major Waldron, Mrs. Kubik,
please approach.

01:33:21.804 --> 01:33:23.388
What the hell is this?

01:33:23.472 --> 01:33:26.099
For reasons of
national security,

01:33:26.183 --> 01:33:28.101
the Department of
Defense has determined

01:33:28.185 --> 01:33:30.437
that charges against
Sergeant Ron Chapman

01:33:30.521 --> 01:33:32.355
are to be withdrawn.

01:33:34.483 --> 01:33:35.984
Court is closed.

01:33:36.068 --> 01:33:39.070
Sergeant Chapman,
you're free to go.

01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:41.323
Oh, my God.

01:33:57.590 --> 01:34:00.550
Shit. Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

01:34:11.395 --> 01:34:16.441
Hey, Charlie. Listen,
in case you're interested,
pal, we won.

01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:21.363
We're going to Marin.
We're blowing this town.

01:34:21.447 --> 01:34:24.366
lf you ever want to call me,
that's where we'll be.

01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:26.117
Hope you're okay.

01:34:29.872 --> 01:34:31.998
Jesus. Look at this.

01:34:36.087 --> 01:34:38.171
What do you suggest l do?

01:34:38.756 --> 01:34:40.840
Have Jackie meet us
on the next block
with her car.

01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:42.759
Will there be more of
them at the airport?

01:34:42.843 --> 01:34:44.010
Probably.

01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:46.763
Why do we need to bother?
Let's just drive.

01:35:04.907 --> 01:35:06.783
Here you go.
Thanks, Embry.

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:10.036
Okay, good.
Thank you for everything.

01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:11.913
Yeah. You take care
of yourself, Mr. Kubik.

01:35:11.997 --> 01:35:13.039
You, too.

01:35:13.124 --> 01:35:15.041
Okay.
Thanks, Jackie.

01:35:15.126 --> 01:35:16.418
Well, kid.
Ma'am.

01:35:16.502 --> 01:35:18.086
Old man.
Turns out you're okay.

01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:20.213
Well, you too, kid.

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:22.674
Thank you so much,
Mrs. Kubik.

01:35:22.758 --> 01:35:24.259
Thank you, Lieutenant.

01:35:24.343 --> 01:35:25.593
We're gonna take our time.

01:35:25.678 --> 01:35:26.720
Okay.

01:35:26.804 --> 01:35:28.221
So we'll call you
when we get there.

01:35:28.305 --> 01:35:30.640
Probably around 7:00.

01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:31.933
Bye.

01:35:32.017 --> 01:35:33.309
Bye.

01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:48.241
About a week before
Paul was murdered,

01:35:48.325 --> 01:35:52.704
he started making phone calls
to an old Marine Corps buddy,

01:35:52.788 --> 01:35:56.750
who, incidentally, was killed
about two months after Paul.

01:35:56.834 --> 01:35:59.419
l don't know what
they talked about,
but it really upset him.

01:36:02.548 --> 01:36:03.882
You have no idea
what it's like

01:36:03.966 --> 01:36:08.136
to see somebody you love
killed right in front of you.

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.638
And you believe
this is somehow connected
to the military?

01:36:11.182 --> 01:36:13.641
Yeah.

01:36:13.726 --> 01:36:17.228
lt's just a feeling,
'cause Paul knew him.

01:36:17.313 --> 01:36:20.732
You know?
Well, he just seemed
to recognize him,

01:36:20.816 --> 01:36:24.319
the thing he did
with the hands.

01:36:24.403 --> 01:36:26.196
Paul seemed to
know who he was.

01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:34.037
You think that
owl's still around here?

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:40.210
You know one thing
that bothered me
more than anything?

01:36:40.544 --> 01:36:43.213
l couldn't protect you.

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:45.298
l had to stand by
while they hurt you.

01:36:48.969 --> 01:36:52.222
Shit. l should have
got more champagne.

01:36:56.060 --> 01:37:01.439
l love you.

01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:08.321
l thought you unplugged that.

01:37:08.405 --> 01:37:10.907
l did, but l tried
Charlie one more time.

01:37:11.408 --> 01:37:14.327
Hi, Claire.
lt's me.

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:16.538
Sweetheart, l'm sorry.

01:37:16.622 --> 01:37:17.664
Look, l'm...

01:37:17.748 --> 01:37:18.706
l'll be right back.

01:37:18.791 --> 01:37:20.458
l'm sorry
l wasn't there today.

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:25.213
l didn't mean
to let you down.

01:37:25.297 --> 01:37:26.881
Yeah, Charlie.
Hi.

01:37:28.133 --> 01:37:32.262
Look, Claire,
l'm real sorry.
l just. . .

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:33.513
l couldn't get there.

01:37:33.597 --> 01:37:34.681
Why today, Charlie,
of all days?

01:37:34.765 --> 01:37:37.684
l mean, what if Marks
had opted to testify
or what...

01:37:39.895 --> 01:37:41.771
You know what?

01:37:41.856 --> 01:37:43.481
l don't want to
talk about it.

01:37:43.566 --> 01:37:44.816
l thought l had a friend.

01:37:47.444 --> 01:37:49.195
l am your friend, kiddo.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.405
Sure you are.

01:37:52.116 --> 01:37:53.449
Just say a toast
for my husband

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:55.159
while you drink
yourself silly.

01:37:55.244 --> 01:37:56.244
Goodbye, Charlie.

01:37:56.328 --> 01:37:59.205
Listen. l am your friend.

01:37:59.290 --> 01:38:02.584
l was being your friend today
more than you'd care to know,
kiddo.

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:05.545
What do you mean?

01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:07.005
We need to talk.

01:38:07.089 --> 01:38:09.799
l just don't think that
now is a good time for it.

01:38:11.093 --> 01:38:13.094
Where are you going?

01:38:13.178 --> 01:38:16.639
l think AA meetings
are supposed
to be anonymous.

01:38:17.308 --> 01:38:18.683
l'm gonna get
some more champagne.

01:38:18.767 --> 01:38:20.226
Okay. Hurry back.

01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:27.191
Are Marks and Hernandez
going to give us trouble?

01:38:29.528 --> 01:38:30.820
ls Tom still there?

01:38:30.905 --> 01:38:32.405
No. He's going to the store.

01:38:32.489 --> 01:38:33.865
All right,
get to your computer.

01:38:33.949 --> 01:38:35.700
Pull up your calendar.

01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:40.997
Find out where
your husband was
on January 20, 1 997.

01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:43.249
Why are you
doing this,
Charlie?

01:38:43.334 --> 01:38:44.959
Look it up, Claire.
lt's important.

01:38:52.384 --> 01:38:54.218
Tom was in Santa Fe,
New Mexico.

01:38:54.303 --> 01:38:57.096
He met a collector.
l picked him up
from the airport.

01:38:57.181 --> 01:38:59.182
February 1 0, '97.

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:09.609
Houston, Texas. Trade show.

01:39:09.693 --> 01:39:10.944
Claire, listen to me.

01:39:11.654 --> 01:39:13.947
Those are the dates
that witnesses were
murdered.

01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:19.577
Stenstrom was murdered
January 20, 1 997,
in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

01:39:19.662 --> 01:39:22.872
Allen died in Houston,
Texas, February 1 0.

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:24.749
And wait a minute.

01:39:24.833 --> 01:39:27.710
Didn't Hernandez say
that Tom tossed his
gun back and forth,

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:29.253
taunting his victims?

01:39:29.338 --> 01:39:31.297
ls he ambidextrous?

01:39:31.382 --> 01:39:32.548
Yeah.

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:35.301
Stenstrom's wife
said the man
shot her husband,

01:39:35.386 --> 01:39:38.012
then tossed
the gun back and forth,
showing off,

01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:40.223
and shot him again
with the other hand.

01:39:44.895 --> 01:39:47.230
l can't talk
about this right now.

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:49.148
Sure.

01:39:49.566 --> 01:39:51.359
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry, Claire.

01:39:51.443 --> 01:39:53.695
l just thought
l ought to let you know.

01:39:53.779 --> 01:39:56.489
Fine. l gotta go.

01:40:14.425 --> 01:40:16.592
l thought you
went to the store.

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:24.642
l grabbed the wrong keys.

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.437
Those are the right keys.

01:40:27.521 --> 01:40:28.980
Those are Jackie's.

01:40:30.441 --> 01:40:31.441
Oh.

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:33.526
What are you
working on there?

01:40:33.610 --> 01:40:35.069
Nothing.

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:40.867
You want to run out with me
to get some champagne?

01:40:40.951 --> 01:40:43.411
l'm not really in
the mood for champagne.

01:40:43.495 --> 01:40:45.455
Ouch ! Tom.
l'm sorry.

01:40:46.582 --> 01:40:49.292
Well, well,
let's just talk then.

01:40:50.794 --> 01:40:52.420
Talk about what?

01:40:54.131 --> 01:40:56.841
About what you
were talking about
on the phone.

01:40:58.677 --> 01:41:01.387
What, you think
l'm stupid, Claire?

01:41:01.472 --> 01:41:02.680
You must.

01:41:04.349 --> 01:41:06.225
Why didn't you come to me
to talk about it?

01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:08.603
You must like to keep
your secrets with. . .

01:41:08.687 --> 01:41:10.980
Your life is
one big secret.

01:41:17.488 --> 01:41:19.072
Did you do it, Tom?

01:41:20.324 --> 01:41:21.824
You can tell me.

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:26.245
l certainly have
a right to know.

01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:30.500
Risked my life for it.
Lost a baby.

01:41:33.212 --> 01:41:34.212
Claire. . .

01:41:34.296 --> 01:41:37.715
Did you kill those people?

01:41:42.012 --> 01:41:43.638
Yes.

01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:48.768
Yeah. Yeah.
l did. l had to. . .

01:41:49.228 --> 01:41:51.687
lt's what l was
trained to do, Claire.

01:41:53.065 --> 01:41:54.941
They lied to me.

01:41:55.025 --> 01:41:57.151
They told me
they were terrorists.

01:41:57.236 --> 01:42:03.658
Told me to interrogate them
and so you do what you have to
do to get every,

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:07.453
any kind of information
you can out of them.

01:42:08.539 --> 01:42:10.039
And so l did.

01:42:11.041 --> 01:42:13.835
Because l was the best at it,
and they knew it.

01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:19.882
What about
Stenstrom and Allen?

01:42:21.844 --> 01:42:25.346
Stenstrom saw me on
the street one day,

01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:29.350
and he told Allen,
and they needed to go away.
You see?

01:42:29.935 --> 01:42:31.727
Do not
look at me like that.

01:42:34.064 --> 01:42:36.691
l do not, not deserve it.

01:42:45.784 --> 01:42:47.034
Sorry.

01:42:48.328 --> 01:42:50.079
l'm a bit tired.

01:42:51.248 --> 01:42:53.666
l was just protecting us.

01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:55.877
We'll get over this.

01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:58.045
You'll see. Honey. . .

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:17.106
No!

01:43:30.996 --> 01:43:34.248
Stop it! Stop it!

01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:37.710
Tom ! Oh, God,
you're hurting me!
You're hurting me.

01:43:41.131 --> 01:43:44.800
You're hurting me.
Stop it. Tom.

01:43:45.552 --> 01:43:49.680
Stop it! Stop.
Look at me.

01:43:49.765 --> 01:43:52.099
Look at me.
Honey. Honey. . .

01:43:52.184 --> 01:43:55.728
Shut up. Shut up.
You're a liar.

01:43:55.812 --> 01:43:57.855
Liar. Don't lie to me.

01:43:59.107 --> 01:44:00.274
Liar.

01:44:07.574 --> 01:44:09.742
l didn't want
to have to do
this to you, Claire.

01:44:09.826 --> 01:44:12.078
Tom. Tom.

01:44:21.797 --> 01:44:23.005
Tom.

01:46:06.610 --> 01:46:10.321
lt's okay. lt's okay.

01:46:51.822 --> 01:46:54.073
l'm sorry.

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:28.899
You're listening
to the Bay Area's
number one station for sports,

01:47:28.984 --> 01:47:30.693
news and information.

01:48:07.898 --> 01:48:10.357
You have a whole
suite of offices here,
Charlie.

01:48:10.442 --> 01:48:15.154
Yeah, but don't talk about it
because l might get spooked.

01:48:15.238 --> 01:48:17.740
l mean, who knows
what might happen?

01:48:19.493 --> 01:48:21.035
How are you holding up?

01:48:22.913 --> 01:48:24.371
l'm okay.

01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:27.833
Same old associate?

01:48:27.918 --> 01:48:29.043
Yeah.

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:32.338
She's back there in
the back somewhere.

01:48:32.422 --> 01:48:36.675
l just brought her
a bone back from lunch,
so she's probably busy.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.345
Hello. Sorry.
Come see me.

01:48:39.429 --> 01:48:40.513
You're beautiful.

01:48:41.139 --> 01:48:42.306
Hello.

01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:48.354
You know, l often ask myself
why l never left San Lazaro.

01:48:48.438 --> 01:48:50.189
Then it occurred to me that,

01:48:50.273 --> 01:48:53.776
hell, l never left
because l didn't have
anyplace else to go.

01:48:56.988 --> 01:49:01.325
You know, it could
read Grimes and Kubik.

01:49:14.923 --> 01:49:16.924
lt's gotta say Grimaldi.

01:49:17.717 --> 01:49:18.717
Huh?

01:49:18.802 --> 01:49:20.302
My maiden name.

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:24.223
And, Charlie,
you gotta do something
about these colors.

01:49:24.307 --> 01:49:25.307
What?

01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:29.562
Well, l'm very sensitive
about my work environment.

01:49:29.646 --> 01:49:31.313
Really?
Yeah.

01:49:31.398 --> 01:49:32.398
So?

01:49:32.482 --> 01:49:33.607
So l was thinking
about a tropical color.

01:49:33.692 --> 01:49:37.069
Just like really pretty,
with a little contrasting
trim on the windows.

01:49:37.153 --> 01:49:38.320
Claire!

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:40.114
Charlie,
check out this exterior.

01:49:40.198 --> 01:49:42.658
l mean,
it's skid-row chic,
l understand that,

01:49:42.742 --> 01:49:45.286
but, you know,
the watermarks gotta go.
That's a given.

01:49:45.829 --> 01:49:48.080
So we could make it. . .

01:50:06.808 --> 01:50:09.768
l don't know you

01:50:09.853 --> 01:50:14.565
Don't know those
melancholy eyes l see

01:50:15.233 --> 01:50:19.028
Do you even know me?

01:50:20.238 --> 01:50:23.532
Your scent is familiar

01:50:23.867 --> 01:50:28.704
Your voice familiar,
but those words you speak

01:50:28.788 --> 01:50:32.708
Are not familiar to me

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:39.423
You can't love nobody
unless you love yourself

01:50:39.507 --> 01:50:42.593
Don't take it out on me, baby

01:50:42.677 --> 01:50:46.055
l'm not the enemy

01:50:46.556 --> 01:50:53.187
Are you the man l love,
the man l know loves me

01:50:53.271 --> 01:50:55.981
Come on, talk to me, boy

01:50:56.066 --> 01:50:59.151
l'm not the enemy

01:51:01.488 --> 01:51:04.740
Your worries, your stress

01:51:04.824 --> 01:51:09.662
Are both the root
of your unhappiness

01:51:09.746 --> 01:51:14.083
Fueled by insecurities

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:19.713
The pressures of being a man
is hard

01:51:19.798 --> 01:51:23.425
Don't think l don't understand

01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:27.262
Put a little faith in me

01:51:28.139 --> 01:51:34.144
You can't love nobody
unless you love yourself

01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:37.398
Don't take it out on me, baby

01:51:37.482 --> 01:51:40.859
l'm not the enemy

01:51:41.027 --> 01:51:47.991
l said, we can't be happy
until you're happy
with yourself

01:51:48.118 --> 01:51:50.744
Come on, talk to me, boy

01:51:50.829 --> 01:51:54.373
l'm not the enemy

01:51:55.959 --> 01:52:02.256
Ooh, what l feel
is unconditional

01:52:02.924 --> 01:52:09.179
l love you at your best
and at your worst

01:52:09.639 --> 01:52:13.434
Don't shove me out

01:52:13.518 --> 01:52:16.437
l'm here for you

01:52:16.521 --> 01:52:22.860
l'm on your side

01:52:50.096 --> 01:52:56.477
You can't love nobody
unless you love yourself

01:52:56.561 --> 01:52:59.396
Don't take it out on me, baby

01:52:59.481 --> 01:53:03.650
l'm not the enemy

01:53:03.735 --> 01:53:10.240
Are you the man l love,
the man l know loves me

01:53:10.325 --> 01:53:13.368
Come on, talk to me, boy

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:17.289
l'm not the enemy

01:53:17.874 --> 01:53:23.796
You can't love nobody
unless you love yourself

01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:26.924
Don't take it out on me, baby

01:53:27.008 --> 01:53:31.178
l'm not the enemy

01:53:31.262 --> 01:53:37.476
We can't be happy
until you're happy
with yourself

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:40.646
Come on, talk to me, boy

01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:44.483
l'm not the enemy
