I GAVE YOU
A COMPLIMENT,

00:22.956 --> 00:25.359
AND YOU GIVE
BACK AN INSULT.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.928
I'M SORRY, EDDIE. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.330
THAT'S BETTER.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.199
SO CAN I BORROW
50 BUCKS?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.069
WHAT HAPPENED?
ANOTHER SPEEDING TICKET?

00:35.136 --> 00:36.537

00:36.604 --> 00:39.840
THEY GOT ME ON SOME
OBSCURE TECHNICALITY.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.275
DID YOU KNOW
THEY EXPECT YOU

00:41.342 --> 00:44.478

EVERY SINGLE TIME?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.950
SORRY, I CAN'T HELP YOU, EDDIE.
I'M SAVING UP FOR A COMPUTER.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.719
THAT'S JUST LIKE YOU...

00:51.785 --> 00:53.587

01:06.100 --> 01:07.435
OOH.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.141
STEVE, I REALIZE

01:13.207 --> 01:15.443
PEOPLE ASK YOU THIS
EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE,

01:15.509 --> 01:18.846
BUT WHY DO YOU
LOOK LIKE THAT?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.483
I'VE BEEN WORKING
IN MY BASEMENT NONSTOP,

01:22.550 --> 01:25.453
AND I DECIDED IT WAS TIME
FOR A FISH STICK BREAK.

01:33.961 --> 01:36.697
MMM.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.433
NOW THAT'S FLOUNDER.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.235
WANT A BITE?

OCEAN TASTE?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.778
SO, YOU STILL
TRYING TO PERFECT

01:50.844 --> 01:52.913
THOSE RADIO-CONTROLLED
GARBAGE CANS?

01:52.980 --> 01:56.250
NOT SINCE
I HAD TO PICK MOM
UP AT THE DUMP.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.120
I'M WORKING
ON SOMETHING MORE
IMPORTANT NOW--

02:00.188 --> 02:01.622

02:18.672 --> 02:20.774
NOPE. FIRST PRIZE

02:31.185 --> 02:32.920
IF YOU WIN
THAT COMPUTER,

02:32.986 --> 02:34.622
COULD I BORROW
IT SOMETIME?

02:34.688 --> 02:36.424
OH, PSHAW.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.827
I ALREADY
HAVE A COMPUTER.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.362
I GOT A USED ONE
FROM NASA.

02:41.429 --> 02:44.232
MY UNCLE COLONEL WERNER
VON URKEL GAVE IT TO ME.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.668
IF I WIN THE COMPUTER,

02:47.735 --> 02:50.371

SOME MAGIC CLUE *

03:54.268 --> 03:58.005
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

03:58.071 --> 04:01.809

04:51.625 --> 04:55.796
OKAY, LET'S SEE.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.170
OH, I GIVE UP.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.371
IT WAS SO EXPENSIVE...

05:37.438 --> 05:39.707
I HAD TO WRITE YOU

05:44.545 --> 05:46.414
WAI-UB-UB-UB-UB--

05:54.388 --> 05:56.056
MAMA, THAT'S TWICE

05:56.123 --> 05:57.558
SO?

05:57.625 --> 06:00.694
MOTHER, I JUST PLAIN DON'T

06:00.761 --> 06:03.631
I SEE HOW
HE LOOKS AT YOU
WHEN YOU WALK BY.

HIS BREATH AWAY.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.717
OH, GREAT. TERRIFIC.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.318
MY WIFE
AND MY SISTER-IN-LAW

06:25.385 --> 06:28.321
ARE GIVING MY MOTHER
FLOOZY LESSONS.

06:28.388 --> 06:33.260
CARL, I'M 80 YEARS OLD,
AND FLETCHER IS 83.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.395
WE'RE SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER

06:35.463 --> 06:38.065
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME LEFT.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.404
AND THAT'S IT, MOM?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.907
OH, NO...

06:46.974 --> 06:49.342
WE ALSO GET
TWO-FOR-ONE DISCOUNTS

06:49.409 --> 06:51.545

07:17.805 --> 07:19.106
MOTHER.

07:19.172 --> 07:23.644
OOH. WELL, WELL.
THE PAPER'S NOT HERE YET.

07:25.412 --> 07:26.714
MOTHER...

07:26.780 --> 07:28.916
IT IS 6:15
IN THE MORNING.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.083
WHERE WERE YOU?

07:30.150 --> 07:31.218
I WAS AT FLETCHER'S.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.521
WHAT? WAS HE THERE?

07:33.587 --> 07:35.823
OH, WAS HE EVER.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.161
MAMA!

07:41.228 --> 07:43.664
OH, LIGHTEN UP.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.265
OKAY, MOTHER,
THAT IS IT.

07:45.332 --> 07:48.101
I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE
THAT FLETCHER EVER AGAIN.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.336
WHAT?

07:49.402 --> 07:51.539

HE IS OFF-LIMITS.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.175
CARL,
I'M YOUR MOTHER.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.243
BUT, MAMA--

07:56.309 --> 07:57.477
YOU SHOW ME RESPECT!

07:57.545 --> 07:58.679
BUT, MAMA--

07:58.746 --> 07:59.980
I KNOW YOU'RE STUBBORN
AS A MULE,

08:00.047 --> 08:02.883
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ACT LIKE A JACKASS!

08:12.926 --> 08:16.564
WALDO, MY TRAFFIC TICKET
HAS TO BE PAID TOMORROW,

08:16.630 --> 08:18.599
OR I COULD LOSE MY LICENSE.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.070
YOU THINK YOU COULD BORROW THE
MONEY FROM YOUR SISTER?

08:25.272 --> 08:26.740
SORRY. MY FAMILY
IS SAVING UP

08:26.807 --> 08:28.676
TO SEND
MY BROTHER REYNALDO

08:28.742 --> 08:31.545
OH. WHAT'S HIS EVENT?

08:35.282 --> 08:37.751
YOU MEAN YOU HAVE TO
PICK ONE AHEAD OF TIME?

08:40.053 --> 08:42.189

10:56.189 --> 10:58.826
GEE, THIS IS INCREDIBLE!
HOW ARE YOU CONTROLLING IT?

10:58.892 --> 11:00.728
AH, NOW, THAT'S THE BEAUTY PART.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.062
YOU SEE, I'M NOT.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.131
URKELBOT HAS
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

11:04.197 --> 11:07.835
AND THAT MEANS HE CAN WALK
AND THINK ALL BY HIMSELF.

11:09.302 --> 11:12.272
I WAS CREATED

12:41.728 --> 12:43.396
NO!
YES!

12:43.463 --> 12:46.533
I THINK I'M IN LOVE.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.804
HOW ABOUT A KISS?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.911
STEVE, THAT HUNK OF METAL
JUST MADE A PASS AT ME.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.112

THIS IS TOO WEIRD.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.322
WOW. A ROBOT
THAT CHASES AFTER GIRLS.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.860
YEAH. WE'RE

13:14.294 --> 13:17.530
URKELBOT, I'M AFRAID I'M GOING

13:42.689 --> 13:43.690
[CLUMP]

13:43.756 --> 13:45.258
[GEARS WHIR]

GOTCHA.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.528
BUT...BUT I FLIPPED

13:48.595 --> 13:52.132
YEAH? WELL, I BYPASSED
THAT CIRCUIT.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.434
"OFF" IS FOR LOSERS.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.569
I'M AN "ON" KIND OF GUY.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.910
OH, LAURA.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.580

I AM YOUR CREATOR,

14:20.193 --> 14:22.963
AND I AM THE BOSS

14:24.431 --> 14:25.798

14:25.865 --> 14:27.567

14:36.209 --> 14:37.610
NOW, LISTEN MOTHER.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.613
I'M AFRAID I HAVE

14:40.680 --> 14:42.549
NO MORE FLETCHER THOMAS.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.816

15:06.406 --> 15:08.075
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.249
YES?

15:23.890 --> 15:25.825
I'M SORRY, MOMMY.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.667
I HATE IT WHEN
YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.739
I DON'T KNOW

ABOUT YOU TWO.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.975
YOU DON'T?

15:42.042 --> 15:44.744
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT
WHEN HE LOOKS AT YOU,

15:44.811 --> 15:48.948
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HE REALLY
LIKES YOU AND RESPECTS YOU.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.184
HOW CAN YOU TRUST
A MAN LIKE THAT?

15:54.087 --> 15:57.024

ASK YOU SOMETHING.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.925
DID YOU
TRUST YOUR FATHER?

15:58.992 --> 16:00.827
ABSOLUTELY.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.895
EVERYBODY DID.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.566
MY FATHER WAS THE FINEST MAN
WHO EVER WALKED THIS EARTH.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.135
YES, HE WAS.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.869
AND THAT'S WHY
I CHOSE HIM.

16:09.936 --> 16:13.673
AND, I MIGHT ADD,
I HAD PLENTY
TO CHOOSE FROM.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.980
I WAS A KNOCKOUT, HONEY.

ARE A KNOCKOUT.

THE GOOD TASTE TO
CHOOSE YOUR FATHER,

16:33.593 --> 16:36.529
SHOULDN'T YOU TRUST
MY JUDGMENT NOW?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.065
