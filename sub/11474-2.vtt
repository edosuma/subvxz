00:00.806 --> 00:02.311
Previously on Hunters...

00:02.910 --> 00:06.050
Abby Carroll, reported
missing less than 24 hours

00:06.051 --> 00:08.518
after her picture was
sent to the Mexican cell.

00:08.553 --> 00:10.920
She's also married to an FBI agent.

00:10.955 --> 00:12.422
Coupled with her spectrum disorder,

00:12.457 --> 00:15.124
I'm afraid self-harming is not
something we're equipped for.

00:15.159 --> 00:17.893
Well, you can't go back to
that school; it's not safe.

00:17.929 --> 00:20.330
'Cause I'm commander of
the exo-terrorism unit.

00:20.365 --> 00:22.265
You think terrorists kidnapped my wife?

00:22.300 --> 00:23.533
Welcome to the ETU.

00:23.568 --> 00:25.501
The terrorists we're
chasing aren't human.

00:25.537 --> 00:26.669
We don't know where they come from.

00:26.705 --> 00:30.005
What we do know is that
Hunters don't come in peace.

00:30.041 --> 00:31.907
McCarthy's here. Headed to security.

00:31.943 --> 00:34.009
Tell me where my wife is. Tell me!

00:34.045 --> 00:36.112
We are many. We are everywhere.

00:36.147 --> 00:38.013
- We're inside.
- And we are angry.

00:38.049 --> 00:40.683
- Inside what?
- The ETU.

00:41.488 --> 00:44.344
The brutal terrorist group
has been highly successful

00:44.345 --> 00:47.212
in recruiting young people
from all over the world

00:47.247 --> 00:49.547
to join its extremist cause.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.750
According to the CIA,
some 3,000 westerners

00:52.786 --> 00:55.854
have traveled to Iraq and
Syria and declared loyalty,

00:55.889 --> 00:58.357
including more than 200 Americans.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.858
And in other news...

01:07.701 --> 01:11.269
Am I a dog, a duck, or a cat?

01:11.305 --> 01:12.837
Quack, quack.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.772
You're a duck. Quack, quack.

01:15.809 --> 01:19.577
There you go. Thank you.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.945
Lovely day, isn't it?

01:20.981 --> 01:22.481
It sure is.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.383
Can I help you find anything?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.951
Yeah.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.520
Whoever this belongs to.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.156
Found it on a bench.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.992
Some poor little bugger isn't
getting his birthday present.

01:34.028 --> 01:37.462
Oh, thank you for bringing it in.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.364
My pleasure.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.318 --> 01:59.751
Yeah.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.854
Carroll, again. Any news on Abby?

02:02.889 --> 02:04.923
Nothing yet.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.859
When was the last time
you got some sleep?

02:10.638 --> 02:11.937
MISSING
ABBY CARROLL

02:42.963 --> 02:45.730
Three months ago, you said
your hair dryer was too loud.

02:45.765 --> 02:48.533
The salesperson assured me
this one was the most quiet.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.536
13 days ago, you complained
your ear buds didn't fit

02:51.572 --> 02:53.638
with your hearing aids.
These are wireless.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.308
And this toothbrush
is 75% more efficient

02:56.343 --> 02:59.077
than your regular one, and it's sonic.

02:59.113 --> 03:02.714
I don't know what that means
exactly, but it sounds cool.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.055
Happy birthday.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.056
I love you.

05:02.811 --> 05:17.387
Hunters 1x02 - Messages

05:25.292 --> 05:27.024
The hurricane.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.993
Ride it and weep.

05:35.435 --> 05:37.835
Yeah, Briggs wasn't kidding.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.871
That's some crazy-ass shit.

05:39.906 --> 05:42.474
Here. You try it.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.142
Let me show you how it's done.

05:51.217 --> 05:53.652
What, the Marines didn't teach
you how to pull the trigger?

06:00.627 --> 06:02.093
What was that?

06:07.534 --> 06:08.866
You're one of them.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.570
I thought you knew.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.607
Only just found out, did you?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.044
Are you one, too?

06:20.079 --> 06:22.213
No.

06:22.248 --> 06:24.015
Just her.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.385
An explosion at a DC mall
has killed seven people.

06:27.421 --> 06:31.289
This was an attack on domestic
soil with civilian casualties.

06:31.325 --> 06:34.493
Their audio message said
blood would be spilled, and it has been.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.795
Seven people died at the mall.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.129
A thermal or chemical explosion

06:38.164 --> 06:39.564
would have killed a lot more.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.366
You're thinking this was a warning?

06:41.401 --> 06:44.035
- Or a message. - They already
sent a message. Literally.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.739
Or it's like Shahzad in Times Square.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.106
The bomb was supposed to be worse,

06:49.142 --> 06:52.310
but the asshole who built
it was royally incompetent.

06:52.346 --> 06:54.746
Whatever the motive, we
have a person of interest.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.715
Surveillance pics.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.761
Finnerman is running interference
with the feds as we speak.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.024
You missed the debriefing.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.062
You mean the one where
you tell me you got

07:11.097 --> 07:12.831
one of them on the payroll?

07:14.368 --> 07:19.070
My wife was kidnapped
by one of those things

07:19.105 --> 07:22.407
and you just expect me
to work alongside one?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.308
Regan earned our trust long ago.

07:24.344 --> 07:27.144
You're still earning yours.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.682
Slavich's last words to
me were about hunters

07:30.717 --> 07:34.786
being inside the ETU.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.822
Do you really need me
to connect the dots?

07:37.858 --> 07:40.859
Slavich was just trying
to mess with your head.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.660
Well, it won't work with that thing.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.963
Look, I realize how
overwhelming this must be.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.132
A new species, hostile.

07:48.167 --> 07:51.068
I reacted the exact same
way when I found out.

07:51.104 --> 07:54.071
I was confused, angry, afraid.

07:57.377 --> 08:00.545
Your wife is still in the picture.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.481
You don't know a damn thing
about what I'm going through.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.618
Maybe not.

08:06.653 --> 08:10.522
But I do have this.

08:10.557 --> 08:12.056
Lionel McCarthy.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.491
The bastard who took Abby.

08:13.527 --> 08:17.261
The DJ, calls himself Lionel
of the Simatic Society.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.764
He's also the main suspect
in this morning's bombing.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.334
We find out where he
is, we find your wife.

08:30.577 --> 08:31.743
You gotta see this.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.645
Viewer discretion is advised.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.914
It's... pretty twisted.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.443
Forgive me.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.362
Chicken shit coward.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.030
Keep watching.

09:37.343 --> 09:38.810
What the hell?

09:47.453 --> 09:49.153
Randall Slavich.

09:49.188 --> 09:51.455
You got six hours to bring me his body,

09:51.491 --> 09:55.593
or more bombs, more dead, more fun?

09:55.629 --> 09:58.262
And one of you creatures
will be hanging here next.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.865
Maybe you, Flynn Carroll?

10:02.201 --> 10:04.602
Or maybe Abby Carroll?

10:07.306 --> 10:09.340
You know what I'm saying.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.611
I'll be in touch.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.013
Quack, quack.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.422
Play it again.

10:28.205 --> 10:29.757
Keep to the script.

10:29.758 --> 10:31.849
Slavich's wife was told
her husband was suspected

10:31.850 --> 10:35.285
of smuggling drugs at the airport.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.787
This is bullshit.

10:36.822 --> 10:38.288
I mean, we should be hunting McCarthy,

10:38.323 --> 10:40.023
not interviewing widows.

10:40.058 --> 10:41.858
Slavich's wife could be a hunter.

10:41.894 --> 10:43.527
Well, is there a test to prove it?

10:44.152 --> 10:46.897
Like a scanner or a DNA sampler.

10:46.932 --> 10:47.997
Not yet.

10:48.033 --> 10:50.400
Jules is working on one.

10:50.436 --> 10:51.468
But I can tell.

10:51.503 --> 10:53.670
What, like a special handshake?

10:54.907 --> 10:56.773
There's something you want to say?

10:58.310 --> 10:59.543
Not to you.

11:00.446 --> 11:02.446
Fine, then. I'll say it for you.

11:02.481 --> 11:06.683
I don't know what planet I
come from, or how I was born.

11:06.718 --> 11:10.487
I don't have an antenna,
except on my car.

11:10.522 --> 11:13.957
I get a weird skin thing
every few months.

11:13.992 --> 11:16.159
I cried when I saw "E.T.,"

11:16.194 --> 11:18.962
and no...

11:18.997 --> 11:22.432
my lady parts do not feel
different than a human's,

11:22.468 --> 11:24.568
but you knew that already.

11:24.603 --> 11:26.369
That's a damn lie.

11:26.404 --> 11:29.773
My wife is not one of you.

11:32.210 --> 11:34.277
We were married six years.

11:34.312 --> 11:36.045
Believe me, I'd know.

12:02.508 --> 12:04.841
McCarthy's sick video offered us a deal.

12:04.877 --> 12:07.611
Slavich's body in exchange
for no more bombings.

12:07.646 --> 12:09.880
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

12:09.915 --> 12:12.448
In 2010, we freed Qais al-Khazali

12:12.484 --> 12:13.984
in exchange for Peter Moore.

12:14.019 --> 12:17.120
We ransomed Abu Sayyaf in
the Philippines in 2001.

12:17.155 --> 12:19.055
Those were live hostages.

12:19.090 --> 12:21.224
And the White House had the press
breathing down their necks

12:21.259 --> 12:22.959
like a pack of hungry wolves.

12:22.995 --> 12:26.763
- Ruth... - I don't pander and I
don't negotiate with terrorists,

12:26.798 --> 12:29.866
especially non-human ones.

12:29.902 --> 12:33.737
We've collected 600 corpses
over the last four years.

12:33.772 --> 12:36.105
This is the first time they've
wanted the body back.

12:36.141 --> 12:38.241
Don't you want to know why?

12:38.276 --> 12:41.210
So we hand over Slavich's
body in return for what?

12:41.246 --> 12:42.445
A chat?

12:42.480 --> 12:44.447
I got my Twitter feed for that.

12:50.288 --> 12:54.524
Why did McCarthy single out
the new agent, Flynn Carroll?

12:54.560 --> 12:58.028
His wife's abduction is
the obvious connection.

12:58.063 --> 12:59.362
And then...

12:59.397 --> 13:00.530
he has the scar.

13:00.566 --> 13:03.099
Does he know what it means?

13:03.134 --> 13:06.036
He claims not to.

13:06.071 --> 13:09.238
Do you trust him?

13:09.274 --> 13:10.740
I don't know.

13:17.515 --> 13:19.082
That's weird.

13:19.117 --> 13:21.585
There was a cage like that
in McCarthy's farmhouse.

13:29.294 --> 13:31.561
They like rabbits.

13:31.597 --> 13:32.796
What, like for pets?

13:32.831 --> 13:35.098
To hunt. They can't help themselves.

13:37.736 --> 13:39.769
Don't worry. I'm a vegetarian.

13:47.613 --> 13:49.545
Mrs. Slavich?

13:49.581 --> 13:51.648
Homeland security.

13:51.683 --> 13:54.017
We'd like to talk to you
about your husband.

13:54.052 --> 13:56.285
I don't know who you
think my husband was,

13:56.321 --> 13:58.855
but he wasn't a drug smuggler.

13:58.890 --> 14:00.790
He was a good man.

14:00.826 --> 14:02.291
And you people killed him.

14:02.327 --> 14:04.928
Your husband was tasered after
assaulting a security officer.

14:04.963 --> 14:08.865
The coroner said he died of an
undiagnosed heart condition.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.234
Then why don't I get to see the body?

14:11.269 --> 14:13.937
Aren't I supposed to
identify him or something?

14:16.141 --> 14:18.775
Did you...

14:18.810 --> 14:22.278
ever notice any type of...

14:22.313 --> 14:24.648
unusual behavior?

14:24.683 --> 14:27.083
Randall was a kind and gentle man.

14:27.119 --> 14:29.385
I mean, he kept rabbits for God's sake,

14:29.420 --> 14:31.487
and now you people are here
telling me that you killed him

14:31.523 --> 14:34.024
because he was a drug smuggler.

14:34.059 --> 14:35.558
I know my husband,

14:35.593 --> 14:38.494
and he was not whatever
you people think he was.

14:40.899 --> 14:44.167
There is one last thing
we need to ask about.

14:44.202 --> 14:47.137
A piece of evidence connected
to your husband's case.

14:52.644 --> 14:55.444
Have you heard this song before?

14:55.480 --> 14:57.113
A song?

14:57.149 --> 14:58.247
Are you joking?

15:06.124 --> 15:09.025
I hate new wave.

15:09.061 --> 15:10.727
No.

15:30.182 --> 15:31.314
Hey.

15:31.349 --> 15:32.481
Excuse me.

15:32.517 --> 15:34.550
Hey.

15:35.553 --> 15:37.286
Hey! What is it?

15:37.322 --> 15:39.589
What's wrong?

15:39.624 --> 15:41.991
Get back in the house.

15:42.027 --> 15:44.060
Get back in the house, please.

15:47.599 --> 15:48.598
Is she one of them?

15:48.633 --> 15:49.866
No.

15:51.369 --> 15:53.136
You're sure?

15:53.171 --> 15:54.270
The second I met her.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.784
INCOMING CALL
PRIVATE NUMBER

16:01.679 --> 16:06.349
- Carroll. - Bring me Slavich's
body, but come alone.

16:06.384 --> 16:08.852
One word about our little
arrangement to ETU,

16:08.887 --> 16:13.156
and you will never see Abby again.

17:56.599 --> 17:58.165
Slavich's body.

17:59.668 --> 18:00.901
You're not getting it.

18:00.936 --> 18:03.270
Couldn't care less.

18:05.975 --> 18:07.575
I got what I really wanted.

18:14.383 --> 18:16.317
I don't see it.

18:16.352 --> 18:18.119
I mean, you were hyped, man.

18:21.190 --> 18:23.457
Nope. Not getting it.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.259
What's so special about you?

18:28.131 --> 18:29.430
What do you want?

18:29.465 --> 18:32.399
What, do you mean me personally or us...

18:32.435 --> 18:33.567
hunters?

18:35.971 --> 18:37.605
Enough game-playing.

18:42.811 --> 18:45.546
How does this work?

18:45.581 --> 18:49.783
I offer you stuff in exchange for Abby?

18:49.818 --> 18:51.051
'Cause I'll do it.

18:51.086 --> 18:53.354
Grade school clever.

18:54.790 --> 18:56.957
You keep me talking till the
tin soldiers come rushing in

18:56.992 --> 18:59.460
with their firecrackers and
their two-bit explosions.

18:59.495 --> 19:01.195
Martian go boom, that's
what you're hoping for,

19:01.230 --> 19:02.863
ain't it, you big, strong Marine?

19:10.273 --> 19:14.041
- Lost contact. - Oh, look,
what a manly man beast you are.

19:14.076 --> 19:16.610
Defying my instructions.

19:16.646 --> 19:19.213
You are one hot-headed police officer

19:19.248 --> 19:22.115
Afghan vet dev in training.

19:23.519 --> 19:25.919
How do you know about me? I
mean, you said so yourself...

19:25.954 --> 19:28.121
The real question is, what
do you know about me?

19:29.859 --> 19:31.124
Nothing.

19:33.429 --> 19:35.596
Except you're an arrogant prick, lapdog.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.899
We've been made.

19:38.934 --> 19:40.467
Take your team through
the back entrance.

19:40.503 --> 19:42.169
Sweep for explosives before you move in.

19:42.205 --> 19:44.638
Roger that.

19:44.674 --> 19:46.039
Regan, can you hear anything?

19:46.075 --> 19:47.341
He's in there alone.

19:47.376 --> 19:49.410
I'm going in.

19:49.445 --> 19:50.844
Regan.

19:50.879 --> 19:51.912
Regan!

19:51.947 --> 19:55.416
Watch your mouth, boy!

19:55.451 --> 19:57.351
Slavich spoke to you
before he killed himself.

19:57.386 --> 19:58.686
What'd he tell you?

20:00.590 --> 20:02.223
I don't know.

20:08.130 --> 20:09.863
He had someone on the inside.

20:09.898 --> 20:11.232
A mole.

20:12.935 --> 20:15.402
Don't give me that B-movie
Keyser Söze crap!

20:20.109 --> 20:22.776
What'd he tell you? What
do you know about us?

20:22.811 --> 20:26.313
Until a week ago, I didn't
even know you existed.

20:26.349 --> 20:29.983
Okay? I didn't even know you
fucking freaks existed!

20:32.020 --> 20:34.154
He took Abby.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.823
He took...

20:36.859 --> 20:37.991
my wife.

20:38.026 --> 20:39.426
My family.

20:42.331 --> 20:44.131
Kids are resilient.

20:44.166 --> 20:45.466
Abby'll be fine.

20:46.502 --> 20:49.035
Maybe.

20:49.071 --> 20:51.305
You go near her, I will destroy you.

20:53.108 --> 20:55.509
I will destroy every last one of you!

20:56.779 --> 20:59.380
Wherever the hell you are from.

21:05.020 --> 21:08.822
Dumb, insignificant, and
nauseatingly sincere.

21:08.857 --> 21:13.427
Thank you so much for
telling me the truth.

21:13.462 --> 21:15.562
You want to see Abby now?

21:15.598 --> 21:16.630
Come on.

21:29.111 --> 21:30.678
She's all yours, tiger.

22:56.799 --> 22:58.265
Regan!

22:58.300 --> 23:00.801
Carroll!

23:03.272 --> 23:04.971
Clear!

23:05.007 --> 23:06.507
Take the top floor!

23:25.360 --> 23:26.627
Finish the sweep.

23:33.168 --> 23:35.101
It's not Abby.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.855
Thanks, Doc.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.083
Hey!

23:49.453 --> 23:50.485
Hey.

23:51.188 --> 23:53.221
Any word on McCarthy?

23:53.256 --> 23:55.323
Nothing yet.

23:55.358 --> 23:56.424
He's disappeared again.

23:56.459 --> 23:58.059
Just like at the airport?

23:58.095 --> 24:00.595
Funny how Agent Regan keeps losing him.

24:00.630 --> 24:03.031
Why would I let McCarthy escape?

24:03.066 --> 24:05.900
I don't know.

24:05.936 --> 24:08.002
Maybe you two are related.

24:08.038 --> 24:10.805
Or maybe you're the mole
Slavich was talking about.

24:12.075 --> 24:14.209
You're just here for yourself.

24:14.244 --> 24:17.411
And you're calling me the traitor?

24:17.447 --> 24:18.512
I could crush you.

24:18.548 --> 24:20.314
Come on, people.

24:20.350 --> 24:21.716
Regan, come away now.

24:26.890 --> 24:28.957
It's not Regan's fault we lost McCarthy.

24:28.992 --> 24:30.625
You better hope so.

24:40.670 --> 24:43.004
We need to talk.

24:43.039 --> 24:44.705
Yeah.

24:44.741 --> 24:46.707
I understand it's difficult with Carroll

24:46.743 --> 24:48.309
under the circumstances.

24:48.344 --> 24:50.478
Give him time, I mean, I
wouldn't trust you either

24:50.513 --> 24:51.545
if I were him.

24:51.581 --> 24:54.048
It's not about Carroll.

24:54.084 --> 24:55.250
Or Paige.

24:57.487 --> 24:58.753
The song.

24:58.789 --> 25:01.122
The one Slavich and McCarthy
used to communicate.

25:01.158 --> 25:03.324
What about it?

25:03.359 --> 25:08.429
When we played it for Slavich's wife,

25:08.464 --> 25:12.500
I saw something in my mind,

25:12.535 --> 25:15.703
not like I see with my eyes.

25:15.738 --> 25:17.672
Images.

25:17.707 --> 25:19.640
More like outlines.

25:19.676 --> 25:21.976
I felt it in the Coahela factory,

25:22.012 --> 25:23.845
and other times in the past.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.047
You haven't mentioned this before.

25:26.082 --> 25:28.883
I didn't know what it was.

25:28.919 --> 25:31.452
And it happened again today
when I heard the clicks.

25:31.487 --> 25:33.922
The code they used to
encrypt their messages.

25:33.957 --> 25:36.024
I don't think it's code.

25:36.059 --> 25:37.959
I think the clicks are the messages.

25:39.462 --> 25:41.930
It could be their language.

25:41.965 --> 25:45.200
And I'm seeing it inside my head.

25:48.705 --> 25:52.240
Everything at this stupid
boarding school has gravy on it.

25:52.275 --> 25:54.542
I told them I don't like
gravy and they said

25:54.577 --> 25:58.446
they would stop putting gravy
on my food, but of course,

25:58.481 --> 26:00.915
it still has gravy on it.

26:04.687 --> 26:06.687
Why do you look so nervous?

26:06.723 --> 26:08.089
I'm not.

26:09.926 --> 26:11.525
I'm making sure everything's safe.

26:11.561 --> 26:14.362
You know, the only thing
dangerous in here is me.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.867
Em...

26:21.338 --> 26:25.773
Can you... recognize this man?

26:26.977 --> 26:28.809
I thought you came to see me.

26:28.845 --> 26:31.712
Em, please.

26:31.748 --> 26:34.382
Prosopagnosia is one of my conditions.

26:34.417 --> 26:35.649
I'm face blind.

26:35.685 --> 26:37.418
A lot of Aspies have it.

26:37.453 --> 26:38.887
Yeah.

26:38.922 --> 26:39.921
I... I knew that.

26:39.956 --> 26:41.756
I mean, it's not 100%.

26:41.791 --> 26:45.760
I see parts, eyes, hands, and voices,

26:45.795 --> 26:47.929
anything with sound helps me.

26:54.837 --> 26:56.871
Em, here.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.706
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

26:58.741 --> 27:02.576
Have you heard this before?

27:13.756 --> 27:16.557
There.

27:16.592 --> 27:18.092
It's starting.

27:23.300 --> 27:24.899
What do you see?

27:29.906 --> 27:33.408
Between the clicks, pieces of light.

27:35.778 --> 27:37.478
Shapes.

27:38.781 --> 27:40.248
Spaces.

27:41.617 --> 27:42.917
I see it

27:42.953 --> 27:45.186
and I hear it at the same time.

27:46.656 --> 27:48.823
You have heard it. Okay.

27:48.858 --> 27:50.124
Where?

27:50.160 --> 27:53.561
It... it was at a music store with Abby.

27:53.596 --> 27:56.130
Where?

27:56.166 --> 27:58.266
- A-Audio Attic.
- Audio Attic.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.169
She was buying sheet music.

28:01.204 --> 28:04.839
- Yeah.
- Oh, no... there were... something else.

28:04.874 --> 28:06.274
And there was... There was...

28:08.178 --> 28:10.979
It was coming out of headphones.

28:11.014 --> 28:12.880
I remember, it was
coming out of headphones

28:12.915 --> 28:14.482
around some guy's neck.

28:14.517 --> 28:15.583
It was really loud.

28:15.618 --> 28:18.319
I can't explain it, the...

28:18.355 --> 28:22.957
the color is from the
shape of the sounds.

28:25.928 --> 28:27.695
It's 3D, but it isn't.

28:27.730 --> 28:29.263
Like bats or dolphins.

28:29.299 --> 28:31.265
Some kind of echolocation.

28:39.842 --> 28:42.143
- Audio Attic.
- Yeah, hi, are you open?

28:42.178 --> 28:43.878
No, we're still closed.

28:43.913 --> 28:46.914
The store's been shut down
ever since the explosion.

28:46.949 --> 28:48.916
An explosion. When?

28:48.951 --> 28:50.218
Two weeks ago.

28:50.253 --> 28:52.286
Everything in the store was destroyed.

28:52.322 --> 28:53.287
Thanks.

28:57.093 --> 28:58.959
Jackson. Carroll?

28:58.995 --> 29:01.629
The bombing in D.C. wasn't random.

29:01.664 --> 29:04.032
McCarthy's cleaning house.

29:04.067 --> 29:05.333
And I know how to find them.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.519
The attack in D.C. was a *** music store.

29:10.776 --> 29:13.033
Bomb was placed *** just
outside the front door.

29:13.098 --> 29:14.697
Music store. Why?

29:14.733 --> 29:16.565
Well, the owners recognized McCarthy

29:16.601 --> 29:17.800
and Slavich as customers.

29:17.836 --> 29:19.501
So did the manager of Audio Attic.

29:19.537 --> 29:22.404
Plus, a third music store
nearby was destroyed in a fire.

29:22.440 --> 29:23.740
McCarthy's covering his tracks.

29:23.775 --> 29:26.075
Yeah, hunters were setting up meetings

29:26.111 --> 29:27.543
via the Spotify channel.

29:27.578 --> 29:29.578
Using music stores as cover?

29:29.614 --> 29:31.580
And to stalk victims like Abby.

29:31.616 --> 29:33.549
It's where McCarthy first saw her.

29:33.584 --> 29:35.451
She was buying sheet music.

29:35.486 --> 29:37.519
Stores that sell vinyl records?

29:37.555 --> 29:38.755
That's anachronistic.

29:38.790 --> 29:41.057
Briggs is right. There aren't many left.

29:41.092 --> 29:43.826
Using McCarthy's Brunswick
farmhouse as the epicenter,

29:43.862 --> 29:46.595
I count 40 within a 300-mile perimeter.

29:46.631 --> 29:48.865
If there is to be another
attack and we get there

29:48.900 --> 29:52.034
before McCarthy, we're looking
at a possible goldmine of intel.

29:52.070 --> 29:54.837
Security footage, receipts,
forensic evidence.

29:54.873 --> 29:56.372
40 stores.

29:56.407 --> 29:58.775
That's the proverbial needle.

29:58.810 --> 30:00.676
There's no way of telling
which one's next.

30:08.186 --> 30:09.551
It's that one.

30:11.522 --> 30:13.389
Blue Peak Music.

30:16.027 --> 30:17.693
That's McCarthy's next target.

30:19.264 --> 30:20.596
How do you know that?

30:22.200 --> 30:23.565
Because I heard it.

30:43.454 --> 30:44.921
Yeah.

30:46.524 --> 30:49.225
Blue Peak Music. Clever creatures.

30:51.495 --> 30:53.429
Thanks for the leg up.

30:54.866 --> 30:57.133
Yeah, yeah, yeah, time
sensitive, I get it.

31:01.272 --> 31:03.906
I hope you left some hot
water for me, sweetheart.

31:06.177 --> 31:08.544
Or I might have to punish you again.

31:40.811 --> 31:42.144
That was Jackson.

31:42.180 --> 31:44.080
He's en route with our backup.

31:44.115 --> 31:47.016
Briggs and I will go in the
back, search the place,

31:47.051 --> 31:48.885
make sure McCarthy isn't in there.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.754
You do that.

31:51.789 --> 31:53.622
I'll take the front.

32:12.643 --> 32:14.110
No sign of McCarthy.

32:14.145 --> 32:15.211
You got anything?

32:23.321 --> 32:24.686
Mrs. Slavich?

32:28.226 --> 32:29.992
- You were in Afghanistan.
- Carroll, you there?

32:30.028 --> 32:32.295
You know what this means?

32:32.330 --> 32:33.963
I press number five,

32:33.998 --> 32:36.899
the bomb I just planted inside
receives a paging signal.

32:36.935 --> 32:39.835
The signal initiates a firing
circuit and then everyone dies.

32:41.072 --> 32:43.406
I don't want to hurt
anybody, but I will.

32:43.441 --> 32:46.108
Okay, okay.

32:46.144 --> 32:47.376
Why are you doing this?

32:47.412 --> 32:49.078
You're not one of them.

32:49.113 --> 32:51.513
He tried to get the body back.

32:51.549 --> 32:53.382
I didn't want Randall cut up.

32:53.418 --> 32:57.987
Dissected like a pig, but you
people wouldn't listen to him.

32:58.022 --> 32:59.956
McCarthy?

33:00.439 --> 33:02.024
He gave Randall his orders.

33:05.129 --> 33:07.129
Slavich's wife.

33:07.165 --> 33:08.864
We need to evacuate.

33:08.899 --> 33:10.132
Now.

33:11.836 --> 33:14.337
Randall picked me, of all
the humans on Earth,

33:14.372 --> 33:18.507
to help him with his cause,
to do what's good, and right.

33:18.542 --> 33:20.176
Follow Brother with him.

33:23.881 --> 33:25.848
Briggs, let me know when you're safe.

33:27.318 --> 33:29.986
How did you figure out
your husband wasn't human?

33:31.603 --> 33:33.956
He told me.

33:33.992 --> 33:36.959
If he hadn't, I never would have known.

33:36.995 --> 33:39.561
They even smell just like us.

33:39.597 --> 33:42.298
Sweat on his clothes.

33:42.333 --> 33:43.599
Our sheets.

33:46.070 --> 33:48.137
He wanted me to know who he really was.

33:53.344 --> 33:55.878
The others, the ones you
came here to track down,

33:55.913 --> 33:58.547
you'll never find them... Find us.

33:58.582 --> 34:00.782
Where are the other hunters?

34:00.818 --> 34:03.319
Where? How many are there?

34:03.354 --> 34:05.321
We're in your houses.

34:05.356 --> 34:07.123
Your churches.

34:07.158 --> 34:09.858
Where you work and eat and sleep

34:09.893 --> 34:11.527
and you don't even know it.

34:11.562 --> 34:12.828
All clear.

34:12.862 --> 34:14.563
Out the back, now.

34:14.598 --> 34:16.364
We're everywhere.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.934
And you can't stop us.

36:00.017 --> 36:02.584
A police search of the Slavich
home found a political

36:02.620 --> 36:05.587
manifesto proclaiming the
suspect's allegiance

36:05.623 --> 36:07.422
to a domestic terrorist group.

36:07.458 --> 36:10.325
Jessie Slavich claimed
responsibility of the bombing

36:10.361 --> 36:13.195
of three other music stores
before dying of injuries

36:13.230 --> 36:14.829
sustained in today's explosion.

36:14.865 --> 36:15.997
Manifesto.

36:16.033 --> 36:17.032
Nice touch.

36:17.067 --> 36:19.034
I love my work.

36:19.069 --> 36:20.935
Shame we couldn't capture her alive.

36:20.971 --> 36:22.837
Well, she got the bomb off

36:22.873 --> 36:24.506
before Agent Regan could stop her.

36:24.542 --> 36:27.809
Thankfully, she only took
herself out and not any of us.

36:27.844 --> 36:29.978
Did we recover anything at the store?

36:30.013 --> 36:32.481
The sonic blast blew everything to bits.

36:32.516 --> 36:35.016
Any evidence that was
inside was destroyed.

36:35.052 --> 36:37.586
So no more leads on McCarthy?

36:37.621 --> 36:40.222
We got some forensics off
the body in the warehouse.

36:40.257 --> 36:42.824
Turns out there was heroin
in the victim's system,

36:42.859 --> 36:44.826
a dirty syringe nearby.

36:44.861 --> 36:46.195
Look into it.

36:46.230 --> 36:48.063
- I'm onto it.
- That is all.

36:55.906 --> 36:58.207
Regan.

36:58.242 --> 37:00.008
Yeah?

37:00.043 --> 37:02.411
You know, the...

37:02.446 --> 37:04.145
patch on your arm? The skin thing?

37:04.181 --> 37:06.448
Relax. It's not contagious.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.086
Jessie Slavich said she
never would have known

37:11.121 --> 37:13.422
what her husband was
if he hadn't told her.

37:14.925 --> 37:17.492
Is there any way to...

37:17.528 --> 37:18.993
you know...

37:19.029 --> 37:20.295
cover it?

37:20.331 --> 37:23.465
With enough lotion if you work at it.

37:23.500 --> 37:24.933
It's basically dry skin.

37:27.605 --> 37:29.571
You want to see it?

37:29.607 --> 37:30.672
Yeah.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.711
McCarthy scratched some pieces off.

37:35.746 --> 37:37.246
It's a bit roughed up.

37:42.052 --> 37:43.151
Abby never had that.

37:43.186 --> 37:45.053
Are you sure?

37:47.386 --> 37:48.624
Yeah, I'm sure.

37:53.430 --> 37:55.297
Seen enough?

37:55.332 --> 37:57.499
I've got a spinach lasagna...

37:57.534 --> 38:00.370
Netflix queue full of "Downton Abbey"
waiting for me at home.

38:00.371 --> 38:02.170
Sounds good.

38:04.341 --> 38:05.340
Hey.

38:07.911 --> 38:09.110
Thanks.

38:18.889 --> 38:21.222
I'm sorry.

38:21.258 --> 38:24.125
You don't owe me an apology.

38:24.161 --> 38:25.494
She was a human collaborator.

38:25.529 --> 38:28.630
She might have led us to other hunters.

38:28.666 --> 38:31.099
Jessie Slavich bombed a civilian target

38:31.134 --> 38:33.134
and was within striking
distance of a fellow agent.

38:33.170 --> 38:35.837
You saved Agent Carroll's life.

38:35.872 --> 38:37.406
I screwed up with Paige.

38:37.441 --> 38:39.574
I screwed up with the music store.

38:39.610 --> 38:43.845
This hunter shit that's inside
me, I can't control it.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.647
I mean, look at me.

38:45.683 --> 38:48.550
I tore that woman to
shreds, like an animal.

38:50.220 --> 38:52.187
And I liked it.

38:52.222 --> 38:55.089
I need the treatment.

38:55.125 --> 38:56.658
You know that's not an option anymore.

38:56.694 --> 38:58.327
But it's worse when I have this.

38:58.362 --> 39:00.495
Everything feels raw like I'm starving.

39:00.531 --> 39:04.300
I just need something to take the
edge off of the urges, please.

39:04.301 --> 39:07.168
Alison, the treatment weakens you.

39:07.204 --> 39:08.503
I need you strong.

39:08.539 --> 39:10.472
But I'm not.

39:10.507 --> 39:13.041
But you are, and you will be.

39:13.076 --> 39:15.677
The unit needs you.

39:15.713 --> 39:18.313
But you'll just have
to manage your demons

39:18.349 --> 39:20.382
the same way as the rest of us.

40:29.950 --> 40:31.143
HAND & BODY LOTION

41:25.308 --> 41:27.008
There you are.

41:27.043 --> 41:31.379
Lurking like trolls
in a Reddit chatroom.

41:31.414 --> 41:33.281
You leather-faced fudder-muckers.

41:37.554 --> 41:43.358
Oh, but we are, even in
these putrid pink wrappers,

41:43.393 --> 41:45.426
we're still losing our shells.

41:49.566 --> 41:52.300
Agent Regan is shedding
like a freakin' cobra.

41:53.837 --> 41:55.370
All right, who's up?

42:03.814 --> 42:05.981
Just a scrape from her arm.

42:07.217 --> 42:08.483
Open wide.

42:31.374 --> 42:34.075
Tell Mosher I hope he chokes on it.
