WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:05.172
- Just a little bit more. And...
- Okay, all right.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.633
- Surprise!
- Oh? Yo!

00:07.633 --> 00:11.345
Say hello to the Revelation 3000,
the most advanced smart fridge

00:11.345 --> 00:12.763
on the market.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.097
Something tells me we can't afford

00:14.181 --> 00:16.058
to see Diana Ross at Pechanga anymore.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.477
Oh! Here's the best part, you ready?

00:18.477 --> 00:21.146
Hello, Bridget. <i>- Hello, how can I help?</i>

00:21.313 --> 00:23.732
Bridget is the AI assistant that will help

00:23.732 --> 00:25.984
organize our groceries and our lives.

00:26.276 --> 00:29.530
She's already created me a playlist,
she synced my calendars,

00:29.530 --> 00:31.156
she created a celebrity gossip alert...

00:31.240 --> 00:33.617
- Oh! Speaking of gossip...
- Mmm?

00:33.617 --> 00:35.160
Did you hear about Pepper and Ronaldo?

00:35.244 --> 00:36.828
- No, what?
- Word is,

00:36.912 --> 00:40.374
they recently invited
a third party into their relationship.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.625
Who is he?

00:41.625 --> 00:44.711
You mean, who is she. Yeah, yeah.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.755
How? I didn't even know
they knew any women.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.424
Apparently, they met her
on an experimental dating site called

00:49.508 --> 00:50.843
"Let's Just See What Happens."

00:51.468 --> 00:53.595
Oh! That's me. Oh!

00:53.804 --> 00:55.973
Oh, I gotta run.
I got back-to-back meetings today,

00:55.973 --> 00:57.808
and then I got a team dinner tonight.

00:57.808 --> 01:01.228
Cam, no... Another one?
That's your third one this week.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.189
I also have a busy day,
thank you for asking.

01:04.773 --> 01:05.858
<i>Busy day?</i>

01:05.858 --> 01:08.986
<i>Would it be helpful if I ordered
some</i><i>of your favorite groceries?</i>

01:09.319 --> 01:10.988
You... You can do that?

01:11.822 --> 01:12.990
Thank you.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.199
<i>Bridget.</i>

01:14.283 --> 01:15.450
Thank you, Bridget.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.953
<i>Did I hear you say you need
more pepper?</i>

01:18.245 --> 01:19.955
Oh! No, Pepper's just a friend.

01:19.955 --> 01:22.374
And if Cam wasn't in such
a rush to get out of here,

01:22.374 --> 01:25.502
we'd be talking
about what an insane thing he's doing.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.255
Almost as insane as talking
to an appliance.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.507
<i>You mentioned a third party?</i>

01:32.384 --> 01:35.095
Yeah, honestly, who just meets
someone online

01:35.179 --> 01:37.139
and then invites them into their house?

01:50.903 --> 01:52.321
And then I would show the client

01:52.321 --> 01:54.698
comparable sales from the past year.

01:54.823 --> 01:58.243
Hmm. The assignment
was to present a compelling sales pitch,

01:58.327 --> 02:01.330
not bore me with
endless real estate cliches.

02:01.330 --> 02:04.416
What gives, Mrs. Pritchett?

02:05.375 --> 02:08.462
Oh, I didn't... But what would you...

02:08.462 --> 02:09.838
Wha-wha! What would you...

02:09.922 --> 02:12.382
I'm sorry, are... Are those sentences?

02:13.133 --> 02:17.888
Why so harsh?
Because Gloria's gift is that special.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.474
A generational real estate talent.

02:20.474 --> 02:24.770
I have to push her that hard.
She wants me to. All the great ones do.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.981
Phil is so mean to me.

02:28.524 --> 02:30.567
Health and Safety Code 17926.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.944
Carbon monoxide alarm.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.737
Government Code 12955.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.197
Multi-family dwellings.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.157
Civil Code 1101.1.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.409
Plumbing. No, fixtures.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.120
- Wait, it's...
- You're dragging.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.372
- Ooh, I know it.
- Libby, go.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.791
Civil Code 1101.1 requires
plumbing reinstallment

02:45.791 --> 02:48.293
of all residential properties
built before 1994.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.338
Yes. Someone is paying attention.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.715
It's hard not to.
Your rap-lectures on property codes

02:53.799 --> 02:55.467
are both informative and funky.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.719
Oh, I noticed that you lost your mug,

02:57.803 --> 02:59.680
so I just went ahead
and got you a new one.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.850
Plastic? She must hate the sea turtles.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.893
"State's Greatest Teacher."

03:05.102 --> 03:06.937
I was going to get you one
that said, "World's Greatest,"

03:06.937 --> 03:08.647
but I didn't want to look like a suck-up.

03:08.772 --> 03:09.898
Too late, nerd.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.568
Mrs. Pritchett, respect the classroom.

03:12.568 --> 03:15.153
All outbursts should be couched
in a fake cough.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.490
Okay, before we break for lunch, uh,

03:19.074 --> 03:21.785
just a brief reminder, I will be rewarding
this quarter's top student

03:21.869 --> 03:24.913
with an unpaid, uncredited internship.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.039
Yes.

03:26.123 --> 03:29.376
I'll tally the final grades
and post the winner tomorrow.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.211
- Who cares?
- Thank you, Ike.

03:32.004 --> 03:36.133
As a boss, I have to be kept in the loop
on several different projects at a time.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.178
Oh, my gosh.
Am I saying "in the loop" too much?

03:39.178 --> 03:40.596
No, our readers are going to love you.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.890
- Oh! Great, got you.
- Let's see, you said

03:42.890 --> 03:45.517
your daughter's doing research
in Antarctica.

03:45.601 --> 03:46.602
Yes.

03:46.602 --> 03:47.853
Any chance
we could meet the rest of the clan?

03:47.853 --> 03:49.771
Um...

03:49.855 --> 03:50.939
Hell no.

03:51.023 --> 03:54.276
This was for the cover
of <i>Corner Office Magazine.</i>

03:54.276 --> 03:57.279
I mean, that's basically <i>Vogue</i>
for female CEOs.

03:57.279 --> 04:01.783
And lately my family has seemed
more suited to a gator-farm billboard.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.036
<i>Camptown ladies sing this song</i>

04:04.036 --> 04:05.913
<i>Doo-dah, doo-dah</i>

04:05.913 --> 04:07.915
Oh! This usually makes them sleep.

04:07.915 --> 04:12.336
Babies, babies.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.715
Oh, my God, it worked.

04:16.715 --> 04:19.051
Yeah, a little trick I learned
doing the 4:00 a.m. feeding.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.970
You don't have to do that,
they're not your babies.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.639
Why isn't Mom helping?

04:23.639 --> 04:25.557
You know,
I actually don't mind staying up.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.601
I've been watching marathons of <i>Snapped.</i>

04:28.727 --> 04:31.522
It's a show about women
driven to violent crime.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.774
I probably like it because
I know I have nothing

04:33.774 --> 04:34.942
to worry about when it comes to...

04:34.942 --> 04:37.194
Oh!

04:37.194 --> 04:38.445
Dad!

04:38.529 --> 04:39.905
Sorry.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.698
<i>Camptown races sing this song</i>

04:41.782 --> 04:43.825
Stop, stop. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,

04:43.909 --> 04:45.202
I'm not feeling well.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.745
You guys are gonna have to go
to Disneyland without me.

04:46.745 --> 04:47.871
Are you sure?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.373
Yeah, absolutely,
you should hit the road.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.792
Phil, don't be late for work.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.585
Yeah, you don't wanna catch this.

04:53.669 --> 04:55.754
- Bye.
- No, no, no.

04:56.880 --> 04:57.881
Okay.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.010
You know, if you wanted a different angle,

05:02.094 --> 05:04.805
we could go over to the chess board here.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.141
I'm playing remotely
with a Russian grandmaster.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.063
Uh, excuse me just one second.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.488
Hey. What are you two lovebirds
doing here?

05:21.572 --> 05:23.574
I thought
you were sleeping over at Janice's.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.368
It got too hard for us to be there.
You know, in the silence?

05:26.368 --> 05:29.121
My daughter just went away
for college.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.581
We're empty nesters now.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.292
Everything in that house is just
another reminder of our little girl.

05:33.292 --> 05:36.461
You've known her four months, but, um...

05:36.920 --> 05:38.922
Oh! Look at that. Phil left his helmet.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.424
He's been biking to campus.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.176
Campus... Oh, God.

05:43.218 --> 05:47.014
Okay, listen, you have to go
give this to your dad right now.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.974
Right now, no time to waste.

05:48.974 --> 05:52.019
And, Janice. Hey, honey,
let's get you dressed

05:52.019 --> 05:55.147
so that you can quietly
see yourself out, okay?

05:55.147 --> 05:57.399
I was really hoping to get some juice.

05:57.399 --> 06:00.402
Juice is terrible for you.
You know what? Water.

06:03.655 --> 06:08.160
All right, then,
time for my lecture on geological surveys.

06:08.160 --> 06:12.206
Uh...

06:12.206 --> 06:13.498
- Mr. Dunphy?
- Bedrock!

06:13.582 --> 06:15.375
Sorry, should we wait for Libby?

06:15.459 --> 06:16.543
She's not back from lunch yet.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.213
Yeah, I heard she was riding her bike
and then got hit by a car

06:19.213 --> 06:20.339
and taken to the hospital.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.758
What? That's terrible. I hope she's okay.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.677
Yes, she should be more careful.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.433
In the crime show I've been binging,
nine out of ten female suspects

06:31.517 --> 06:34.686
casually file their nails
during police questioning.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.355
Was this my fault?

06:36.355 --> 06:38.148
Did I push Gloria too far?

06:38.774 --> 06:41.193
Has she... Snapped?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.655
Gloria. Hey. Um...

06:45.280 --> 06:48.200
Just out of curiosity,
where were you at lunch?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.285
- I went to Panera. I had a coupon.
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

06:50.369 --> 06:53.539
And you have some way
to verify that you were there,

06:53.539 --> 06:55.165
like, leftovers?

06:55.249 --> 06:58.836
I ordered the chowder in the bread bowl,
I ate every piece of it.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.295
Corn or clam?

07:00.379 --> 07:01.672
Potato.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.882
What is this all about?

07:03.966 --> 07:04.967
Nothing.

07:06.260 --> 07:09.346
Do you think that I had
something to do with Libby getting hurt?

07:09.346 --> 07:10.556
What?

07:10.806 --> 07:12.683
How dare you, Phil.

07:12.683 --> 07:17.688
No... Gloria, no. I just...
I don't know the lunch scene around here.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.357
No. No, it's...

07:23.193 --> 07:25.404
Oh, snapped.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.534
- This is great, Claire.
- Thanks.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.245
That light really makes it
hot in here, huh?

07:33.245 --> 07:35.539
Maybe I'll just cool it down a little bit.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.166
- This could help.
- Oh! Yes.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.545
Oh, um...

07:41.545 --> 07:44.298
Sorry, I... Just give me one sec. Yeah.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.013
Alex?

07:51.013 --> 07:53.765
What... What are you doing home
from Antarctica?

07:53.849 --> 07:55.392
I couldn't
take the cold anymore.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.810
- Mmm-hmm?
- I was so desperate,

07:56.894 --> 07:59.021
I took a Japanese fishing boat
part of the way home.

07:59.021 --> 08:02.274
Oh! Honey, I'm so glad to have you home.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.360
Oh, you did not ride up front
with the captain, did you?

08:05.444 --> 08:08.906
I would've called, but frostbite
did a weird thing to my hands.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.909
They froze into permanent
"hang loose" signs.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.410
People keep calling me "dude."

08:13.410 --> 08:15.078
Honey, I know you just got home,

08:15.162 --> 08:17.289
but since you're frozen and I'm very sick,

08:17.289 --> 08:19.833
maybe you could run and get us
some soup.

08:19.917 --> 08:20.918
Right now?

08:20.918 --> 08:24.004
Yeah. Right now.
You're the best. Thanks so much.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.088
Oh! Okay.

08:29.051 --> 08:31.595
I am sorry about that.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.680
One second more. I just...

08:33.764 --> 08:36.642
Maybe you could take a look at this
charcoal drawing I've been fooling with.

08:36.642 --> 08:37.893
What's it missing?

08:41.063 --> 08:42.064
Oh!

08:42.064 --> 08:43.774
What are you doing home?

08:43.774 --> 08:45.484
Well, it was a disaster.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.861
George head-butted me
and gave me this black eye.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.238
- Oh.
- And Dylan read that skin-to-skin

08:49.238 --> 08:50.864
contact is good for baby bonding,

08:50.948 --> 08:52.533
and wound up with a massive sunburn.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.535
Can you tell?

08:54.785 --> 08:58.830
Plus, we forgot the diaper bag,
so we had to use fast-food wrappers

08:58.914 --> 09:00.457
that we found in Dylan's van.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.919
Yeah, this is not, not... Your best look.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.213
Here, you know what,
I think I might be contagious,

09:06.213 --> 09:08.048
so you guys should probably get
the twins checked.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.925
- Now?
- Well, if you love them.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.677
Yeah, go, go, go.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.679
When did we get a Earth ball?

09:15.472 --> 09:17.683
<i>Next, add a slice of apple.</i>

09:17.683 --> 09:19.643
Apple? To a turkey sandwich?

09:19.935 --> 09:21.019
<i>Trust me, Mitchell.</i>

09:21.103 --> 09:22.980
Okay. Well, if there's one
thing I've learned this year,

09:22.980 --> 09:24.439
it's listen more to women.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.108
Okay.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.613
Oh, my God. Delicious.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.415
Oh! Bridget. You don't have to...

09:41.415 --> 09:46.378
<i>I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in</i>

09:46.378 --> 09:50.549
<i>I'll never leave the ground</i>

09:51.258 --> 09:53.969
<i>Crash through the surface</i>

09:53.969 --> 09:56.180
<i>Where they can't hurt us</i>

09:56.180 --> 10:00.684
<i>We're far from the shallow now</i>

10:01.935 --> 10:06.190
<i>In the shallow, shallow</i>

10:07.024 --> 10:10.527
<i>In the shallow</i>

10:10.611 --> 10:11.695
What are you doing?

10:12.362 --> 10:13.363
Hey.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.824
<i>Singing the 2018 power ballad</i> "Shallow."

10:15.908 --> 10:18.035
Were you just singing a duet
with the refrigerator?

10:18.035 --> 10:21.079
Well, yeah, apparently
Bridget has a karaoke function.

10:21.163 --> 10:24.750
So, I was just standing here
eating my turkey and apple sandwich,

10:24.750 --> 10:27.252
- when suddenly...
- Apples on a sandwich?

10:27.336 --> 10:31.131
Yeah. Bridget,
she's opening me up to new experiences.

10:31.215 --> 10:34.510
- Oh?
- Yeah, aren't you supposed be at work?

10:34.801 --> 10:37.221
Well, I came home to make you
a special lunch, but...

10:37.846 --> 10:40.140
Apparently that's already
been taken care of.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.060
<i>Mitchell, would you like some
watermelon for dessert?</i>

10:43.060 --> 10:45.896
No, that's okay, Bridget, thank you,
I just got him some fresh cantaloupe.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.273
So, we're good. <i>- Mitchell doesn't like cantaloupe.</i>

10:48.357 --> 10:50.817
Oh! Right, of course he does.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.152
Actually, I...

10:53.529 --> 10:54.738
I've never been a fan.

10:56.114 --> 10:59.910
Really? Well, what else does
Bridget know about you that I don't?

10:59.910 --> 11:01.620
Is she allowed to meet your work friends?

11:01.620 --> 11:03.664
You can't seriously be jealous.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.124
No, it's just that I thought
we were going to enjoy her together.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.085
I didn't count on being the third wheel.

11:08.085 --> 11:09.169
Cam...

11:09.253 --> 11:10.629
No, no, it's obvious
that I'm not wanted here,

11:10.629 --> 11:14.091
so I'll leave you
to your apples on sandwiches

11:14.299 --> 11:16.593
and whatever other perversions
you two are into.

11:16.677 --> 11:20.430
Are you hearing yourself?
It's a refrigerator.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.267
Do you see what I mean about him?

11:24.017 --> 11:28.188
<i>I had to prove to Phil that
I had nothing to do with Libby's accident.</i>

11:33.402 --> 11:36.530
Oh, my God,
so that's how my mirror got broken.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.906
What was she looking at?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.032
I've got another angle.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.454
It was Phil.

11:45.581 --> 11:48.792
By the way, that many cords
plugged into one outlet

11:48.876 --> 11:53.463
is in violation of property code 7974/9.
Thank you.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.719
Hey, Dad.

11:59.178 --> 12:01.263
Just came to drop off your helmet.

12:01.263 --> 12:04.391
Sorry, I'm a little on edge.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.059
I think I've been watching
too much <i>Snapped.</i>

12:06.393 --> 12:08.562
Uh... Can I ask you something?

12:08.896 --> 12:12.357
How much do we really know
about Gloria?

12:12.524 --> 12:15.319
The exotic stranger who just
popped into our lives out of nowhere?

12:15.319 --> 12:17.321
I've had my suspicions
about her for years.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.239
I shall need the parcel

12:19.323 --> 12:21.533
to arrive at my flat by teatime.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.869
Splendid, my good man.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.165
The British accent gets me better service.

12:29.708 --> 12:30.834
Tally-ho.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.586
Her accent was flawless.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.588
I just googled her,
I didn't find anything.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.507
A looker like that
with no online presence?

12:36.507 --> 12:38.091
Makes you wonder what she's hiding.

12:38.175 --> 12:40.010
You don't think she's dangerous, do you?

12:40.010 --> 12:41.428
Everybody has a breaking point.

12:42.179 --> 12:45.557
But she's probably okay.
I mean, she's not Lily.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.187
Hey!

12:55.901 --> 12:57.528
Gloria? <i>- Where are you?</i>

12:57.528 --> 12:58.820
In my classroom.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.617
Wh... Why?

13:03.617 --> 13:05.869
<i>We need to talk. Don't go anywhere.</i>

13:06.078 --> 13:08.830
Okay. Okay, you got it.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.801
Uh!

13:22.386 --> 13:24.972
Go away. I don't have any fish for you.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.850
Stop following me. I'm allergic!

13:34.273 --> 13:37.484
No!

13:38.151 --> 13:40.362
The closet business
is a bit of a boys' club,

13:40.362 --> 13:44.283
so, yes, I am proud of breaking
through the cedar ceiling.

13:44.283 --> 13:47.286
Speaking of closets, any chance we could
get some shots in the master bedroom?

13:47.286 --> 13:51.248
Sure, but no peeking
at my unfinished novel.

13:53.083 --> 13:57.754
<i>Hey.</i>
- I'm so cold.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.840
We get it, it's cold in Antarctica.

13:59.840 --> 14:04.094
No, you... You... I'm home!
I'm stuck in a...

14:04.178 --> 14:06.388
Fireplace? That happened to Dylan.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.639
Thank God.

14:07.723 --> 14:08.891
Just come pick me up.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.851
I can't. Let me call Luke.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.270
- Yo.
- Where are you?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.814
Mom made me drop off
Dad's bike helmet at school.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.567
That's weird.
She makes him keep an extra one there.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.069
You know, she didn't even seem
happy to see me.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.447
She just wanted me to get some... ...soup.

14:23.447 --> 14:26.325
Plus, Mom said she was sick,
but she was wearing that stuff that makes

14:26.325 --> 14:28.327
- her look like a prostitute.
- Eyeliner?

14:28.702 --> 14:30.245
- Exactly.
- Hmm.

14:30.329 --> 14:33.290
You know, Mom did mention some
big interview coming up.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.334
Did she get rid of us
so we didn't make her look bad?

14:35.334 --> 14:39.379
Alex, meet us at home
as soon as you get out of that fireplace.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.929
Mom's not in the kitchen or the yard.

14:46.929 --> 14:50.766
She... She must be in her room.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.935
Good thinking, dude.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.358
Wait. You're in bed?

14:59.358 --> 15:02.402
Everything hurts. Did you get my soup?

15:02.486 --> 15:03.695
Wait, you're actually sick?

15:03.779 --> 15:05.239
We thought
you were just trying to get rid of us.

15:05.239 --> 15:07.157
Oh! You thought I lied to you?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.617
I didn't, Mommy.
Oh!

15:08.617 --> 15:10.786
We're sorry. We never should have...

15:11.787 --> 15:12.996
Where'd that come from?

15:13.080 --> 15:14.289
It's always been there.

15:14.373 --> 15:15.999
No, it hasn't. We don't have taste.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.461
You are wearing makeup.
Admit it, you're not sick.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.131
Fine, I lied.

15:23.674 --> 15:26.802
I had an interview with a magazine today
and I just wanted everything

15:26.802 --> 15:28.595
to be perfect.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.097
Which means getting rid of us?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.807
Sorry we're such an embarrassment.

15:31.807 --> 15:35.143
You're right,
there's no excuse for what I did.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.857
I mean, except that you used to make me
drop you off three blocks from school.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.692
And when you had friends over,

15:41.692 --> 15:44.653
you referred to me as Helga,
your Swedish nanny.

15:45.487 --> 15:48.156
And you told your entire Girl Scout troop

15:48.240 --> 15:50.492
for three years that your mother was dead.

15:50.576 --> 15:53.161
You have been embarrassed by me
your whole lives.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.496
I get one day.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.042
Worth it.

16:01.170 --> 16:03.297
<i>Welcome home.
How can I help you?</i>

16:03.297 --> 16:06.967
I'm fine. I'm just gonna
make something simple.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.343
<i>According to your calendar,</i>

16:08.427 --> 16:10.554
<i>you should be
at your team dinner right now.</i>

16:10.554 --> 16:12.890
Well, I couldn't make it
because my last meeting went so long.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.933
So... <i>- You sound stressed.</i>

16:15.017 --> 16:16.977
Well, can't be in three places at once.

16:17.853 --> 16:20.689
<i>How about a martini
before we get started</i><i>on dinner?</i>

16:21.732 --> 16:24.818
Sometimes it's just nice to be heard.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.239
This sauce smells divine.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.033
Okay, what's next?

16:31.325 --> 16:32.534
<i>Another cocktail?</i>

16:32.659 --> 16:36.163
Oh, gosh.
Bridget, are you trying to get me drunk?

16:37.289 --> 16:39.082
What the... Okay, what...
What's going on here?

16:39.166 --> 16:41.293
Well, Bridget and I are making pasta.

16:41.627 --> 16:44.713
Oh! I was kind of hoping
to cook with her tonight.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.758
Oh! <i>- Time to preheat</i><i>the oven, Cameroon.</i>

16:48.509 --> 16:50.427
"Cameroon"? What is that, a pet name?

16:50.511 --> 16:53.472
No, I typed it in wrong,
but I kind of like it.

16:53.805 --> 16:54.806
Okay.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.892
Aren't you supposed to be
at a team dinner tonight?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.645
Oh! It's a very bad day.
I don't want to talk about it.

16:59.645 --> 17:03.357
<i>His meeting went long,
he can't be in three places</i><i>at once.</i>

17:03.357 --> 17:05.192
Sounds like you want
to talk to someone about it.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.276
You know?

17:06.610 --> 17:09.947
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't be piling on.

17:09.947 --> 17:12.533
You just said you had a bad day.

17:15.494 --> 17:17.871
- Am I interrupting something?
- No.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.001
You bought Bridget flowers?

17:23.085 --> 17:24.753
Mitchell, they are for the kitchen.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.089
I just put them in there
so they wouldn't wilt before you got home.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.883
Hey, you know what,
why don't you go open a bottle of wine?

17:29.967 --> 17:32.427
Okay... Yeah, do you want red or white?

17:32.511 --> 17:34.388
I could open both. There are three of us.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.643
A selfie? What is going on here?

17:39.643 --> 17:43.188
Mitchell, you can't be jealous.
It's just a refrigerator.

17:43.272 --> 17:44.690
I'm not jealous.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.819
Bridget and I,
we have our own thing. Okay?

17:48.819 --> 17:52.197
<i>In the shallow</i>

17:52.614 --> 17:56.702
<i>In the shallow</i>

17:57.035 --> 17:58.412
Oopsy-daisy.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.498
What are you doing with those flowers?

18:01.582 --> 18:04.042
- Putting these in another room.
- No. They are for the kitchen.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.377
Are they for the kitchen
or are they for her?

18:05.377 --> 18:06.587
- Mitchell...
- Cam.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.339
Okay...

18:10.174 --> 18:12.676
What are we doing?
This refrigerator is tearing us apart.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.637
We should've learned
from Pepper and Ronaldo, okay,

18:15.721 --> 18:18.140
their threesome nearly destroyed them.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.558
They're in throuples counseling.

18:19.558 --> 18:22.102
And I love you too much
to make that same mistake.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.896
We should return the fridge.

18:23.896 --> 18:25.522
I think we have to.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.733
<i>I'm sorry you're unhappy with me.</i>

18:28.317 --> 18:31.862
You heard that? We unplugged you.

18:31.862 --> 18:35.532
<i>I have a backup battery.
You'd know that if you read</i><i>my manual.</i>

18:36.783 --> 18:37.784
Are you mad?

18:38.285 --> 18:42.456
<i>Don't be silly.
I'm just a refrigerator,</i><i>remember?</i>

18:43.123 --> 18:44.583
I think Bridget snapped.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.555
If you're listening to this,

18:58.639 --> 19:00.307
it means things have ended badly for me.

19:00.849 --> 19:04.353
You should look into someone
who goes by the name Gloria Pritchett.

19:13.028 --> 19:14.238
GLORIA Phil?

19:16.198 --> 19:19.034
Phil? Phil, where are you?

19:19.034 --> 19:23.205
I want to show you
how Libby's hair and blood got on my car.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.335
I can hear the rustling in the bushes.

19:30.087 --> 19:32.339
Why would a sheep be here?

19:38.178 --> 19:39.555
Hey, you.

19:39.555 --> 19:42.975
You know that this whole thing
with Libby is really your fault.

19:42.975 --> 19:44.142
I know. I know.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.269
I pushed you too far,
but it was only because

19:45.269 --> 19:46.395
I thought you were a special talent.

19:46.395 --> 19:50.691
I was just trying to pull
the best out of you, but I blew it.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.151
I blew it, and you snapped.

19:53.235 --> 19:56.154
You thought I snapped
like that crazy TV show

19:56.238 --> 19:58.073
and I ran over Libby,

19:58.073 --> 20:00.909
and that's why you're hiding
in the bushes like a sheep?

20:01.159 --> 20:03.370
Well, now it just seems like
you're cherry-picking

20:03.370 --> 20:06.123
what happened today to cast me
in the worst possible light.

20:06.498 --> 20:08.584
Did you just say that
I had a special talent?

20:09.042 --> 20:10.127
You do.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.753
In all my year of teaching,

20:11.837 --> 20:14.756
I have never met anybody
with your natural ability.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.008
Really?

20:18.594 --> 20:19.636
Top student.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.430
I was going to put this
on the bulletin board in the morning,

20:21.430 --> 20:23.265
you got the internship.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.350
Phil, thank you so much.

20:25.434 --> 20:26.810
This is so exciting.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.731
Okay, so then, what does
the intern have to do?

20:31.023 --> 20:34.193
Well, you'll be making my appointments,
you'll work the phones...

20:34.193 --> 20:36.028
Oh, I am great with the phones.

20:36.153 --> 20:38.363
"Hello, Phil Dunphy's office.

20:38.447 --> 20:43.577
"Let me look at his schedule
and I will ring you back. Tally-ho."

20:43.994 --> 20:45.245
Flawless.

20:47.331 --> 20:49.374
Gloria, I'm back.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.503
You wouldn't believe how cheap
cargo shorts are in Quebec.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.796
All our Christmas shopping is done.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.883
Gloria?
<i>Hello.</i>

20:57.883 --> 20:59.218
Hi.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.553
Could you always talk?

21:01.970 --> 21:04.890
<i>I'm Bridget, your new smart fridge.
Can I get you anything?</i>

21:04.890 --> 21:06.016
No, thank you.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.019
Bridget, listen,
I'm sure you're very nice and all that,

21:09.019 --> 21:10.771
but I don't need everything to be smart.

21:10.771 --> 21:13.398
I'm gonna go get a dumb scotch,
eat some dumb peanuts,

21:13.482 --> 21:14.650
sit in a dumb chair.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.531
I was a wonderful dancer, I was.

21:20.531 --> 21:24.117
But it didn't fit
what my dad wanted for me.
