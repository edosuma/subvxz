WEBVTT

01:08.236 --> 01:10.037
Dispatch, this is 24.

01:10.037 --> 01:13.407
I got a hole cut in the fence
on the southeast side.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.609
<i>Confirm.
Did you say a hole?</i>

01:15.609 --> 01:18.078
Yeah, right where
the camera went out.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.582
I also got a silver Chevy
parked across the street.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.717
I'm gonna go check this out.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.406
Dispatch, 24.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.107
<i>Go, 24.</i>

01:47.107 --> 01:50.144
We've got
a serious problem out here.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.279
Looks like some kind of--

02:18.105 --> 02:20.641
The movers didn't
miss a thing.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.277
It's weird seeing
the place so empty.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.612
Mm.

02:24.612 --> 02:27.581
We had good times here.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.850
Can't believe
we're letting it go.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.385
It's been six months, Remy.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.786
With the market the way it is,

02:32.786 --> 02:35.456
we're lucky Mom got
what she got.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.090
I guess.

02:37.090 --> 02:41.195
You know, I had my first kiss
in that driveway, right there.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.463
Mm-hmm.

02:42.463 --> 02:43.831
Margo Delgotta.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.666
I remember.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.935
Oh, man.
She was a piece of work.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.470
Mm-hmm.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.105
I also remember when Mom
caught me in the basement

02:52.105 --> 02:53.774
with Jimmy Bowers.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.309
Grounded me for,
like, three months.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.411
And me, for not telling her.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.480
You always had my back.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.748
Always.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.115
Hey, look what
I found in the attic.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.387
Oh, my god. Mikey.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.188
1997.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.558
He pitched a shutout
at home to beat Trinity.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.059
They won state the next week.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.094
He was like
a rock star that day.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.763
Mm-hmm.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.133
I still miss him, Remy.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.602
Every day.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.072
Yeah. Me too.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.742
We should go to a Mets game
for his birthday.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.444
- Mm-hmm.
- He'd like that.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.416
Oh, work.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.385
I gotta go.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.586
Love you, kid.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.020
Love you.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.658
Hey, can you leave it?

03:44.658 --> 03:46.026
I wanna see what else
is in there.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.428
Yeah, sure.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.806
Huh.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.589
Our guard reported
a hole in the fence

04:15.589 --> 04:18.426
and a silver Chevy
parked across the street.

04:18.426 --> 04:22.663
He went to investigate, radioed
back we had a major problem.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.197
Then the dispatcher
heard the pops

04:24.197 --> 04:25.533
before he could
finish the sentence.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.167
- He was shot?
- Yeah.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.602
Before the bomb went off.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.104
I'm not sure which
is a worse way to go.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.073
What's the Department
of Energy doing here?

04:33.073 --> 04:35.108
Because of what
Bomb Squad found.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.077
At least eight pounds
of Semtex was used,

04:37.077 --> 04:39.713
and what's leftover of the IED
components are military grade.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.149
They think it could be
a terrorist attack.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.084
Anyone claiming
responsibility yet?

04:44.084 --> 04:45.586
No, and nothing in the
online chatter, either.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.854
We're not waiting.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.489
We already doubled security
at all our other

04:48.489 --> 04:49.690
locations in the state.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.859
Hey, Remy.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.294
PD found a burnt-out
silver Chevy Cruze

04:54.294 --> 04:56.129
in an abandoned lot
six miles from here.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.565
Now, the plates
were smoked out,

04:57.565 --> 04:59.032
but they ran the VIN number.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.101
It was stolen two days ago
in Youngstown.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.637
Could be our guy.
You two run it down.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.510
Ohio Energy
is earning its pay today.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.611
And then some.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.045
People are pissed.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.447
Our entire switchboard's
lighting up

05:13.447 --> 05:14.882
like a Christmas tree.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.316
What's the ETA getting
the power back up?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.819
At least another three hours,
if we're lucky.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.354
We just spoke to the
director of security

05:20.354 --> 05:21.955
at Bani Blockchain.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.792
They're a cryptocurrency server
farm based out of Conneaut.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.326
Well, they're the worst
of the bunch.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.496
We're getting calls
from them every hour.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.297
They say their two
backup generators

05:30.297 --> 05:31.632
were sabotaged last night.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.266
Cut out their
whole power supply.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.568
Tell them to get in line.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.069
We got 1,000 problems,
and they ain't one.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.270
Wait.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.972
The only trunkline
that got taken out

05:38.972 --> 05:40.474
was the one dedicated to them.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.942
How many trunklines
are there?

05:41.942 --> 05:44.044
Four.
The others were untouched.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.546
Sounds like someone
didn't want

05:45.546 --> 05:47.347
Bani Blockchain to have power.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.350
Lucky for them, they just
shot to the top of our list.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.890
Found the grinder
they must have used.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.527
I doubt there are prints,
but they didn't do the best job

05:59.527 --> 06:01.061
of setting this thing on fire.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.630
Yeah, these tire tracks
indicate high ridges.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.197
Sharp zags.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.699
The kinds the boys
in the bayou use.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.501
Probably their getaway car.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.702
ERT's on the way.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.703
We'll get them
to process the tracks.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.238
All right.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.006
Oh.

06:13.006 --> 06:17.110
This is probably what they used
to set the car on fire.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.914
The smell, the color.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.784
It's uh--it's contaminated.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.853
Makes it less flammable.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.821
Okay, why--why would
they use bad fuel?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.890
I don't know.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.460
We need to find the person
who owns this car.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.294
See where it was stolen from.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.899
This is a total disaster.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.068
No power, no generators.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.103
I've been chief security
officer for five years.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.672
I've never seen
anything like this.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.173
And all these servers
have Bitcoin?

06:46.173 --> 06:48.275
- No, we just mine them.
- Well, what's the difference?

06:48.275 --> 06:49.443
Look, all you need
to know is,

06:49.443 --> 06:51.545
we make our money
when these 8,000 servers

06:51.545 --> 06:53.413
are operating at full capacity.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.016
Every minute they're down,
we're losing millions.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.852
Our CEO's already on his way
from San Francisco,

06:58.852 --> 07:01.689
and when he arrives,
all hell is gonna break loose.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.290
Graham Solinder, right?

07:03.290 --> 07:05.325
Yeah. The Crypto King.

07:05.325 --> 07:06.694
I read about him.

07:06.694 --> 07:09.062
Elon Musk 2.0.
Notoriously private.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.398
That's an understatement.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.400
This will only be
the second time I've seen him

07:13.400 --> 07:15.268
since he's hired me.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.671
These are our
backup generators.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.807
Our engineers found
contaminated oil

07:19.807 --> 07:21.308
inside the tanks.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.110
Clogged the filters,
shut down the valves.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.945
Ray and Kristin
said they found a container

07:24.945 --> 07:27.214
of contaminated fuel
in the burnt-out Chevy.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.549
Could be related.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.783
See anyone suspicious
around here lately?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.051
No.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.252
When were these tanks
last refueled?

07:32.252 --> 07:33.521
Two days ago.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.623
Northern Oils have serviced
our server farms

07:35.623 --> 07:37.024
for the last five years.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.258
We've never had a problem
with them.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.895
It's the power company.
I need to take this.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.363
Whatever you need,
you just let me know.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.068
Northern Oils reported
a break-in two weeks ago.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.804
CCTV cams caught
a vehicle registered

07:50.804 --> 07:52.039
to TerraFuture Limited.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.307
It's an environmental
activist group.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.843
They were responsible
for sabotaging

07:55.843 --> 07:57.477
that oil pipeline in Texas.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.979
Yeah, well,
according to their website,

07:58.979 --> 08:01.181
they have a lot of issues
with Bani Blockchain.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.716
All right. Pay them a visit.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.152
I'm gonna go see our friends
at the Department of Energy.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.958
Pretty nice digs for an NGO.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.760
We're fortunate
to have wealthy backers.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.927
I didn't realize
there was such

08:13.927 --> 08:16.930
a big market in ecoterrorism.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.499
We go after ethically
negligent corporations

08:19.499 --> 08:21.869
who deserve to be held
accountable for their actions.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.937
Such as Bani Blockchain.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.673
Yeah, we've been very
transparent about wanting

08:25.673 --> 08:27.274
to shut them down.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.842
What's your problem
with them?

08:28.842 --> 08:31.078
They're terrible
for the environment,

08:31.078 --> 08:32.780
and a huge drain on the grid.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.648
Do you have any idea
how much energy

08:34.648 --> 08:36.083
that server farm consumes
in a day?

08:36.083 --> 08:38.218
- No.
- 1,000 megawatts.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.153
That's enough
to power Cincinnati

08:40.153 --> 08:41.454
and Cleveland combined,

08:41.454 --> 08:43.123
and those numbers
are only trending upwards.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.025
Okay, so by taking out
their generators,

08:45.025 --> 08:46.594
you reverse that trend?

08:46.594 --> 08:48.796
I told you, I didn't
know anything about that.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.463
Kristin.

08:50.463 --> 08:51.464
One second.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.600
Yeah.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.001
Kristin, what's up?

08:54.001 --> 08:55.268
We've got our unsubs.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.970
Ray found a Ring video
of two white males

08:56.970 --> 08:58.806
stealing the silver Chevy
two days ago.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.173
We ran facial rec
and got a hit.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.909
Yeah, Jonah and Billy Tanner.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.977
All right, I'm gonna
send you their photos.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.579
We are heading to their
last known in Ashland.

09:05.579 --> 09:06.980
All right, thanks.

09:12.119 --> 09:15.055
So this is who
we're looking for.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.490
The Tanner brothers.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.592
Do you know them?

09:18.592 --> 09:19.693
Yeah.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.795
They--they used to work here.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.631
I fired them about
two weeks ago.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.998
Why is that?

09:24.998 --> 09:27.034
They worked exclusively
on Bani Blockchain.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.836
They organized
rallies and protests.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.403
But they wanted
to take things further,

09:30.403 --> 09:32.539
be much more aggressive.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.307
I refused, and I let them go.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.710
That's around the same time
that Bani Blockchain's

09:36.710 --> 09:38.211
generators got sabotaged.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.580
Whatever they've done,
I can assure you,

09:40.580 --> 09:42.883
we weren't a part of it.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.384
Okay, fine.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.419
We're gonna need to see
their personnel files anyway.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.756
Of course.
Whatever you need.

09:57.497 --> 10:01.802
I think you can streamline
the third line from the top.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.370
Might solve your problem.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.672
Can't do that.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.874
It'll collapse the bundles
in the tiering.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.441
It's not gonna work.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.711
I'm right.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.212
You are right.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.181
The bundles will collapse.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.783
It's not gonna work.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.184
I'm right.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.887
How did I get such
a smart son, Will?

10:19.887 --> 10:21.421
Oh.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.422
Time to go, Dante.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.891
But I'm still working.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.393
I know.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.796
But the timer's up.
- Mm...

10:28.796 --> 10:31.564
It's okay.
You can work again later.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.743
Wait. I forgot my dolphin.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.145
I need my dolphin.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.821
Ah! Ah!

10:53.821 --> 10:55.455
No, loud! Loud!

10:57.991 --> 11:00.460
Dad?

11:00.460 --> 11:02.963
Dad!
- Get in the car now!

11:02.963 --> 11:04.264
Dad!

11:09.369 --> 11:10.971
Will? Will?

11:10.971 --> 11:12.906
Will?

11:12.906 --> 11:16.877
William, where is my dad?

11:16.877 --> 11:19.112
Where's my dad?

11:21.348 --> 11:26.920
Dad!

11:26.920 --> 11:29.156
Somebody help!

11:35.929 --> 11:37.197
It looks like an ambush.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.866
We got two bodyguards dead,
also the pilot.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.500
No signs of Graham Solinder.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.802
Any witnesses?

11:41.802 --> 11:44.571
Just his son over there.
His name's Dante.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.039
- He was on the plane?
- Yeah.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.274
I think he's autistic.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.475
He won't speak to PD.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.676
The only thing
he's told Sheryll

11:49.676 --> 11:51.278
is that two men came
and took his dad,

11:51.278 --> 11:52.412
and he wants him back.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.081
It had to be the Tanners.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.548
But how'd they
get past security?

11:55.548 --> 11:57.517
The tarmac gate is unmanned.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.386
The manager said they had
to have a valid keycard.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.221
So either they
hacked the system--

12:01.221 --> 12:02.923
Or they had help.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.425
Forget activists going rogue.
This is about Graham.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.960
The Tanners bombed
that substation

12:06.960 --> 12:08.495
because they knew it was
the only way to get him here

12:08.495 --> 12:09.797
and to draw him out.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.765
Yeah, but why not
just kidnap him?

12:11.765 --> 12:13.566
Demand a ransom.
I mean, look at this jet.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.770
The guy's got millions.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.671
Dante have any next of kin?

12:18.671 --> 12:19.940
No siblings.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.741
His mother died of cancer
when he was 14.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.076
It's just him and his father.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.311
All right.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.478
I wanna speak with him,
but not here.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.914
He's too stressed.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.583
Hold this for me.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.354
I pushed the button.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.024
My father said
whenever I get lost or scared,

12:37.024 --> 12:39.059
push the button.
I pushed the button.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.994
That was smart.
Got us here fast.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.730
I want my dad,
and they took my dad.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.298
I know they did, Dante.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.567
And we're gonna find him.
Can you help me with that?

12:47.567 --> 12:48.701
I can help.

12:48.701 --> 12:49.870
They took my dad.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.571
Are these
the two men you saw?

12:51.571 --> 12:54.541
Him and him?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.509
I didn't see their faces.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.445
Did you hear them
say anything?

12:58.445 --> 12:59.679
I heard guns.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.082
Guns and guns and guns.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.851
It was loud.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.685
Do you remember
anything else, Dante?

13:05.685 --> 13:08.055
I don't know.
They took my dad!

13:08.055 --> 13:09.689
Okay. Okay.

13:12.325 --> 13:18.565
Dante, let's--let's
breathe together, okay?

13:20.100 --> 13:22.102
Breathe with me.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.736
Here, watch me.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.812
Let's do it together, okay?

13:32.812 --> 13:35.382
Nice, deep breath.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.822
Better, right?

13:45.392 --> 13:47.627
That's a dope keychain.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.829
You like dolphins?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.999
Yeah. Uh, dolphins are smart.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.733
They have their own names.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.169
They use sound vibrations
and echolocations

13:56.169 --> 13:58.305
in their whistles
to identify each other.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.107
Wow. I didn't know that.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.208
I know.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.877
My mother
was a marine biologist.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.545
She died of cancer.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.314
I like dolphins.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.624
Dante, I have to speak
to one of my colleagues.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.059
You're gonna stay here
with Sheryll.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.827
She's super cool.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.562
You want a soda?

14:22.562 --> 14:23.730
I saw a vending machine.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.833
It was a green Jeep.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.536
- What's that?
- It was a green Jeep.

14:29.536 --> 14:34.841
It had big tires, and a yellow
fish sticker on the back.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.277
It was a green Jeep.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.645
Thank you, Dante.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.013
That's really helpful.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.781
Get a BOLO out.
- Yeah.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.050
Thank you.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.055
How's he doing?

14:48.055 --> 14:50.523
Scared and confused.
He wants his dad.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.025
Where are we on the Tanners?

14:52.025 --> 14:54.361
Well, their place was empty.
No computers, no phones.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.963
I did find something
on their parents, though.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.564
They used to live
at a Jolet trailer park

14:57.564 --> 14:59.166
in Rockport, Texas.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.434
Eight years ago,
Bani Blockchain bought the land

15:01.434 --> 15:03.570
to turn it into a server farm.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.372
They kicked all
the residents out,

15:05.372 --> 15:07.740
and the Tanners
were left homeless.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.709
Their father committed suicide
two years later.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.678
So they hold Bani Blockchain responsible

15:11.678 --> 15:13.213
for their father's death.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.647
It's definitely
a potential motive,

15:14.647 --> 15:16.883
which does not bode well
for Graham.

15:16.883 --> 15:20.387
Well, I dug into
TerraFuture's phone records.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.122
Now, before he was fired,

15:22.122 --> 15:23.991
Billy Tanner was in touch
with Peter Garrison

15:23.991 --> 15:25.825
of Wolfheart Ventures
in Cleveland.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.995
Garrison wanted to know
what kind of things

15:27.995 --> 15:29.896
Billy had in mind
for Bani Blockchain.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.999
- Were they working together?
- Unclear.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.067
Garrison was an investor,
and on the board

15:34.067 --> 15:36.569
at Bani Blockchain
before Graham kicked him out.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.071
So he has a grudge.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.073
Grab Ray and go see
Garrison in Cleveland.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.808
Keep digging into TerraFuture.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.876
I gotta call social services
and figure out

15:43.876 --> 15:45.278
what we're gonna do with Dante.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.416
So you've never met
Jonah or Billy Tanner?

15:49.416 --> 15:51.051
Not in person, no.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.852
But I did talk with Billy
a few times on the phone.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.154
What was that about?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.622
Well, he and his brother
were trying

15:55.622 --> 15:58.091
to take down Bani Blockchain,
and I wanted to help.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.193
But he never said anything
about kidnapping or murder.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.462
If he had, I would have
called the police.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.964
Yet you still invested
$1 million into TerraFuture.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.000
Had nothing to do
with the Tanners.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.168
That was to stick it to Graham.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.837
For kicking you
off the board?

16:10.837 --> 16:11.804
I don't care about that.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.140
So why, then?

16:13.140 --> 16:15.075
Because, uh, he's a crook.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.644
And he needs to pay
for what he did.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.312
Three months ago,
I found a bunch

16:19.312 --> 16:22.582
of suspicious transactions
on Bani's quarterly ledger.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.284
I had my team dig into it.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.719
Turns out Graham
pulled out 20 million

16:26.719 --> 16:28.088
from the company's
crypto wallet.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.889
Pulled out, as in stealing?

16:29.889 --> 16:31.091
That's not what he called it.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.792
And when I brought it up
to the board,

16:32.792 --> 16:35.595
Graham said that they were
loans which he would pay back.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.796
The board bought it.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.765
Then he convinced them
to get rid of me.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.200
All right,
but Graham's a billionaire.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.569
So why does he need to steal
from his own company?

16:42.569 --> 16:44.504
Because that's what he does.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.173
Why dig into your own pocket
when you can get

16:46.173 --> 16:47.507
someone else to pay for it?
- All right.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.876
So what was the money for?

16:49.876 --> 16:51.344
Another jet?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.046
I found out he was
working on something.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.882
Some pet project of his
that was costing him millions.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.150
Did he tell you
what that was?

16:57.150 --> 16:58.985
No.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.353
He wouldn't tell anyone.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.222
And believe me,
I tried to find out.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.823
The truth is,
Graham paints himself

17:03.823 --> 17:08.261
as this tech visionary, but all
he is is a liar and a fraud.

17:08.261 --> 17:12.299
You ask me, he had this coming.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.000
Garrison appears to be right.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.968
Graham is a bit
of a controversial figure.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.704
Visionary tech genius
on the one hand,

17:17.704 --> 17:19.539
egotistical tyrant
on the other.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.174
That sounds like a lot
of corporate CEOs.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.609
Maybe he's just misunderstood.

17:22.609 --> 17:25.778
Single dad, takes his kid
everywhere he goes.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.080
Dante obviously loves him.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.082
That counts for something.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.751
Garrison was right
about the money too.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.287
These are Bani Blockchain's
accounts.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.389
Now, in the last six months,
Graham's transferred

17:36.389 --> 17:38.758
20 million in Bitcoin
from the corporate account

17:38.758 --> 17:40.660
into his own personal
crypto wallet.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.095
Can you tell what it's for?

17:42.095 --> 17:44.164
Well, the crypto wallets
have 128-bit passwords.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.233
Not even the best hackers
in the world can crack that.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.535
But I did trawl
Graham's computer.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.704
The logs show that he
transferred the 20 million

17:51.704 --> 17:53.640
onto a Level-1 USB stick.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.142
Why would he do that?

17:55.142 --> 17:57.110
With crypto exchanges
going down,

17:57.110 --> 17:58.778
getting hacked,
the safest place

17:58.778 --> 18:00.313
are on password-protected
thumb drives.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.849
The 20 million's gotta be
what the Tanners are after.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.017
How would they know about it?

18:05.017 --> 18:07.320
There are six directors
at Bani Blockchain

18:07.320 --> 18:09.822
that had access
to the company's crypto wallet.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.090
Maybe one of them told them.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.227
Social services just called.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.129
They can't pick up Dante
till tomorrow morning.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.265
That's fine.
He can stay with us tonight.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.634
- Really?
- Yeah. Put him in my room.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.870
What?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.805
I like the kid.
He's funny, he's smart.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.140
Great.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.708
Start digging
into those board members.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.210
See if there's any connection
to the Tanners.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.145
They gotta be
out there somewhere.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.725
He's late.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.160
Would you relax?

18:47.160 --> 18:48.961
He said that he'll be here,
and he will.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.497
What if he doesn't show?

18:50.497 --> 18:53.300
After all we did,
we're stuck here with Graham?

18:53.300 --> 18:55.067
What, are we gonna
just leave him here?

18:57.904 --> 18:59.639
See?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.308
You just get too wound up.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.418
- Where is he?
- The bathroom.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.952
Money first.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.621
We want our cut,
like we talked about.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.956
You didn't keep
your end of the deal.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.024
What the hell
are you talking about?

19:18.024 --> 19:18.991
We did everything you asked.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.993
Not everything.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.295
I said no killing.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.996
I was explicit about that.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.399
Hey, we didn't have a choice.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.501
You wanted Graham.
We brought him.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.102
After what he did
to our father,

19:30.102 --> 19:32.705
you're lucky we didn't just
put a bullet in him too.

19:32.705 --> 19:36.075
And if four dead bodies
weren't bad enough,

19:36.075 --> 19:38.044
you left Graham's kid
on the plane.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.146
What kid?

19:40.146 --> 19:42.148
You never said anything
about a kid.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.785
You should have checked.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.641
Tom, what are you doing?

20:08.641 --> 20:09.642
Are you helping these guys?

20:09.642 --> 20:11.478
Don't worry about it.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.513
Where's Dante?
Is he okay?

20:13.513 --> 20:14.647
You shouldn't have
brought him, Graham.

20:14.647 --> 20:17.284
He's my son, Tom.
He needs me.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.718
He gets very upset
when I'm not around.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.620
Will you quit talking
about your damn kid?

20:20.620 --> 20:22.955
Please, Tom, whatever
you want, just tell me, okay?

20:22.955 --> 20:24.056
- Shut up, man.
- Please.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.325
- Shut up!
- Dante needs me.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.726
Just tell me whatever it is--
- Shut up!

20:29.095 --> 20:30.763
The USB stick.

20:30.763 --> 20:31.964
Where is it?

20:31.964 --> 20:34.667
I don't have it. I swear.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.736
You think
I'm playing with you?

20:38.805 --> 20:40.807
Okay! Okay! Okay, stop.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.208
<i>Stop.</i>

20:42.208 --> 20:44.143
<i>My college professor has it.
- You're lying!</i>

20:44.143 --> 20:45.244
<i>No, I'm not. I swear.</i>

20:45.244 --> 20:46.779
<i>He has a house in Bellevue.</i>

20:46.779 --> 20:49.015
<i>Please, Tom, take me there,
and I'll give it to you.</i>

20:49.015 --> 20:50.116
<i>Whatever you want.</i>

20:50.116 --> 20:52.652
<i>Get up. Let's go.</i>

20:56.122 --> 20:57.657
<i>Does he have the USB stick?</i>

20:57.657 --> 20:58.858
Not yet.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.092
Graham's taking him
to where it is.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.428
A house in Bellevue.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.229
<i>Keep following him.</i>

21:03.229 --> 21:05.765
<i>Don't move in until you
have eyes on that stick.</i>

21:22.214 --> 21:23.816
Hey, guys.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.184
How was your night?

21:25.184 --> 21:27.086
We had room service
two times.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.755
Pepperoni pizza
and then hot dogs.

21:28.755 --> 21:29.989
Yeah, we did.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.624
And Dante destroyed me
in chess.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.025
I won seven times.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.327
Yeah, but that one game
was pretty close.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.428
No, it just took longer.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.797
I won seven times.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.500
Who's that?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.834
I don't know who she is.
- Okay, Dante.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.035
This is Mrs. Frampton.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.171
She's very nice,
and she's gonna take you

21:45.171 --> 21:46.639
to the Capaldi Center.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.441
They're gonna look after you
until we find your dad.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.077
I wanna stay with you guys.
I'm gonna help.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.812
I wanna find my dad.
- I know you do, buddy.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.046
But you have to trust me.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.548
This is for the best.
- No.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.184
I don't wanna go with her.
I wanna stay with you guys.

21:58.184 --> 21:59.852
I wanna find my dad.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.355
Remy, we got something.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.657
I need to talk to Hana
and Sheryll for a second.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.526
No, I don't wanna go
with Mrs. Frampton.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.294
I'll be right back.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.729
PD just called.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.598
The Tanners were found dead
at a motel in Canton.

22:11.598 --> 22:12.699
What about Graham?

22:12.699 --> 22:13.800
Still missing.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.535
Ray and Kristin
are on their way.

22:15.535 --> 22:18.037
Dante, come here.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.606
I have to go, but you're
gonna stay here

22:19.606 --> 22:21.608
with Hana and help.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.142
She's good at computers.

22:23.142 --> 22:25.378
No, she's not.
She's the best.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.417
But maybe you can teach her
something about TikTok.

22:30.417 --> 22:33.586
Mrs. Frampton,
there's been a change of plan.

22:33.586 --> 22:34.721
Dante's staying with us.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.322
Yay.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.993
This way. Come on.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.995
I'm gonna show you
some top-secret stuff.

22:42.995 --> 22:45.432
Ooh!

22:45.432 --> 22:47.033
There's the green Jeep.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.336
Big tires and a yellow
sticker, just like Dante said.

22:50.336 --> 22:52.539
Remy--two shell casings
in the room,

22:52.539 --> 22:54.140
but nobody heard any gunshots.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.775
We did get something, though.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.910
Security cam footage
caught a Mercedes Benz

22:57.910 --> 22:59.912
leaving the Tanners' room
around midnight.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.147
Tell me we got a plate.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.616
Yeah.
BOLO went out 20 minutes ago.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.017
Kristin's running the driver.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.019
Mercedes belongs
to Tom Wallis,

23:07.019 --> 23:09.388
chief security officer
at Bani Blockchain.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.390
The guy who showed us
the server room yesterday?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.225
Son of a bitch
kidnapped his own boss.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.527
He was playing us
from the start.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.529
Yeah, but the Tanners
took Graham first.

23:16.529 --> 23:17.730
Maybe he put them up to it,

23:17.730 --> 23:18.731
then double-crossed them
and took them out

23:18.731 --> 23:20.199
to cover his own tracks.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.435
Or he found out about
the 20 million on his own,

23:22.435 --> 23:23.836
seized the opportunity.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.538
Whatever he did,
he used his own car.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.306
Obviously, he thought he was
gonna get away with this.

23:27.306 --> 23:28.941
He's ex-military.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.743
Used to work as a bomb disposal
technician out of Fort Carson.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.978
And if he knows
how to disarm them,

23:31.978 --> 23:33.012
he knows how to build them.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.481
He's also drowning in debt.

23:34.481 --> 23:37.016
He owes 500 grand to a bridge
loan company in Maryland,

23:37.016 --> 23:38.618
and that loan is due
in two weeks.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.587
All the more reason
to kidnap Graham

23:40.587 --> 23:41.788
and get that 20 mil.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.756
Okay, so from Tom's
social media,

23:43.756 --> 23:45.458
he's in a relationship
with Marla Stevens,

23:45.458 --> 23:48.027
account manager
at Solleben Marketing.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.497
Lives at 54 Redgrove Drive
in Alliance.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.298
Barnes and I will
take Tom's apartment.

23:52.298 --> 23:54.534
You two go see
his girlfriend Marla.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.573
I don't understand.

24:00.573 --> 24:03.643
We--we just celebrated
our six-month anniversary

24:03.643 --> 24:05.745
two days ago.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.047
I really thought
he was the one.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.382
Did he tell you about
the loan that he took out?

24:10.382 --> 24:12.318
No.

24:12.318 --> 24:15.755
I mean, I--I knew that
he was strapped for cash.

24:15.755 --> 24:18.024
He told me that
he used to gamble a lot.

24:18.024 --> 24:22.094
But he said he was over that
now, that he'd gotten help.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.063
You don't think that's why
he took the money out, do you?

24:24.063 --> 24:25.898
Because he was gambling again?

24:25.898 --> 24:27.767
Marla, we know
how difficult this is,

24:27.767 --> 24:29.201
but we have to find Tom
before he makes

24:29.201 --> 24:30.837
things worse for himself, okay?

24:30.837 --> 24:32.772
He--he didn't tell me
anything, I swear.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.406
Okay.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.709
Did you notice any change
in his behavior lately?

24:36.709 --> 24:38.310
Um...

24:40.046 --> 24:42.181
Well, the last few weeks,
he was leaving

24:42.181 --> 24:43.883
first thing in the morning.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.985
He said he was working
on some big project.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.486
Okay. Good.
Where would he go?

24:47.486 --> 24:49.055
I don't know.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.658
He would leave here at 6:00,

24:51.658 --> 24:53.560
and then come back again
at 8:00

24:53.560 --> 24:56.495
with a bag of sushkis,
and then head to work.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.897
A bag of what?

24:57.897 --> 24:59.932
Sushkis.

24:59.932 --> 25:03.002
They're, um, Russian bagels.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.971
They're my favorite.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.639
Did he give you
an address, maybe?

25:06.639 --> 25:08.407
Or an area? Anything.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.910
Nothing.

25:10.910 --> 25:14.080
He would, uh, come back--

25:14.080 --> 25:16.348
his shoes were always
covered in sand.

25:16.348 --> 25:21.187
And he'd change out of those,
and then he'd leave again.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.856
Okay. What kind of sand?

25:23.856 --> 25:26.025
Black sand.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.194
I didn't even know
sand came in black.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.764
Thank you.

25:31.764 --> 25:34.667
Tom's apartment was a bust.

25:34.667 --> 25:35.835
Wait, where's Dante?

25:35.835 --> 25:37.469
Kristin took him
to get some food.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.438
All right, catch me up on the
Russian bagels and black sand.

25:39.438 --> 25:40.873
Tom was sneaking off
or something?

25:40.873 --> 25:42.141
I think I found
where he was going.

25:42.141 --> 25:45.111
Paska Deli in Hanover Harbor.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.313
Ooh, that's where
they make sushkis, right?

25:47.313 --> 25:49.448
Yeah, the best
in the Midwest, apparently.

25:49.448 --> 25:52.484
It's next to Mitchum Grains,
which is a black sand exporter.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.086
Any idea what Tom
was doing there?

25:54.086 --> 25:56.355
Well, I hacked into one
of Mitchum Security cams.

25:56.355 --> 25:59.225
He's been meeting up with the
Tanners at their loading dock.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.594
Six times in the
past three weeks.

26:01.594 --> 26:03.495
Was he planning the bombing
or Graham's kidnapping?

26:03.495 --> 26:05.364
Hold on.

26:05.364 --> 26:08.534
Who's that guy watching them?
- Which guy?

26:08.534 --> 26:09.936
White dude, buzz cut.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.170
He's in the background
on a lot of these.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.305
Could be one
of the dockworkers.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.407
The image is clear enough
for facial rec.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.179
Gavin Brisker.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.581
Ex-South African
Special Operations Command.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.117
Dishonorably discharged
ten years ago.

26:25.117 --> 26:28.354
Multiple priors
for kidnapping and extortion.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.389
So was he following them,
or was he working with them?

26:30.389 --> 26:31.958
That's what we need
to find out.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.592
Guys, we just got a hit
on the BOLO.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.663
Neighborhood patrol found Tom's
Mercedes parked on the street

26:36.663 --> 26:39.932
outside 7 Portland Road
in Bellevue, empty.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.434
That's three miles from here.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.971
The house belongs
to Tim Bolton,

26:44.971 --> 26:46.839
retired economics professor
at Stanford.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.040
He's 68 years old.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.541
Barnes and Ray with me.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.714
- Where is it?
- Please.

26:54.714 --> 26:55.982
Give me the USB stick now.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.383
I'll put a bullet in you.

26:57.383 --> 26:58.751
Just give it to him,
Professor Bolton.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.252
Okay. Okay.

27:00.252 --> 27:02.722
It's in the vase on that table.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.524
Get it.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.627
Move!

27:21.908 --> 27:23.776
This is it?

27:23.776 --> 27:24.977
Yes, it is.

27:26.879 --> 27:27.914
20 million, baby.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.216
Who's there?

27:30.216 --> 27:31.851
Who the hell is that?

27:31.851 --> 27:33.953
I don't know.
I live alone.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.654
Hey!

27:35.654 --> 27:38.190
I'll give you three seconds
to come out,

27:38.190 --> 27:39.726
or I swear to God--

27:48.200 --> 27:49.401
Who the hell are you?

28:01.347 --> 28:03.249
That's Tom's Mercedes.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.551
He's still here. Let's go.

28:07.086 --> 28:10.089
Help! Help, please!

28:10.089 --> 28:11.190
In there!
- Okay, I got him.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.926
You guys go. You okay?

28:13.926 --> 28:15.527
Come on. Come this way.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.831
Where's Graham?

28:51.831 --> 28:53.132
- They took him.
- Who?

28:53.132 --> 28:54.834
I--I don't know.

28:54.834 --> 28:55.935
I don't know!

28:55.935 --> 28:56.969
I don't know.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.655
You have it?

29:21.260 --> 29:23.830
Rest of your money is inside.

29:29.668 --> 29:32.638
Good to finally meet you,
Mr. Solinder.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.120
This the guy who took Graham?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.721
Yeah, that's him.

29:49.721 --> 29:50.990
He just showed up
out of nowhere.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.859
Not exactly.
We found this in your car.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.726
He was following you.
- What?

29:54.726 --> 29:56.062
Who the hell is he?

29:56.062 --> 29:57.263
I think you got
it backwards, pal.

29:57.263 --> 29:58.564
We're the ones
who ask the questions.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.731
What kind of car
was he driving?

29:59.731 --> 30:02.501
Look, I didn't see
any damn car.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.936
Son of a bitch stole my money.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.804
There was 20 million
on that thumb drive.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.874
It's a USB stick,
and it's not your money.

30:07.874 --> 30:09.909
Yeah, it's not Graham's, either.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.310
He stole it from the company.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.712
The board was too chicken
to do anything about it.

30:13.712 --> 30:15.081
Unlike you, right?

30:15.081 --> 30:17.884
You're so brave,
you hire Jonah and Billy Tanner

30:17.884 --> 30:19.151
to do your dirty work,

30:19.151 --> 30:20.652
and then you kill them
for their trouble.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.788
Jonah and Billy are morons.

30:22.788 --> 30:24.590
They were never supposed to--

30:24.590 --> 30:26.225
No, no.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.360
You know what, screw this.
I'm done talking.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.795
I want a lawyer.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.864
First smart thing
I've heard you say, dumbass.

30:31.864 --> 30:35.467
Graham never stole anything.

30:35.467 --> 30:36.668
He took out loans
from the company

30:36.668 --> 30:38.704
to pay for software engineers

30:38.704 --> 30:40.839
for a project
he was working on.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.875
But that has nothing to do
with the USB stick.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.310
Wait, so there's
no money on it?

30:44.310 --> 30:45.577
No. There never was.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.346
No, no, no. He's lying.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.680
He probably took his own cut--

30:48.680 --> 30:49.848
I thought
you were done talking.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.052
Yeah, shut up.

30:53.052 --> 30:56.188
So if it isn't money,
what's on there?

30:56.188 --> 30:59.725
I'd prefer to discuss that
in private.

30:59.725 --> 31:01.527
Graham was a true savant.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.662
A rare capacity to innovate

31:03.662 --> 31:06.832
and execute
at a frightening rate.

31:06.832 --> 31:08.901
I taught a class
on the democratization

31:08.901 --> 31:10.136
of the fiscal economy.

31:10.136 --> 31:12.238
About--about leveling up
the playing field.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.839
Professor,
can you skip to the part

31:13.839 --> 31:16.875
where you tell us
what this is about?

31:16.875 --> 31:20.546
That's what I'm trying
to explain to you, Agent Scott.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.548
Graham was trying
to democratize

31:22.548 --> 31:24.483
the global economy.

31:24.483 --> 31:28.654
He was building a code for a
new type of cryptocurrency.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.056
He called it Kelekona.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.391
A plug-in software
that any country

31:32.391 --> 31:33.792
could deploy in an instant.

31:33.792 --> 31:35.928
So this is about
a piece of code?

31:35.928 --> 31:37.964
It isn't just
a piece of code.

31:37.964 --> 31:41.033
It--it's a masterpiece.

31:41.033 --> 31:46.038
This is a world with no banks,
no cash, no oversight.

31:46.038 --> 31:49.608
Rich or poor, all countries
get a seat at the table.

31:49.608 --> 31:54.313
Kelekona is going to completely
revolutionize our way of life.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.814
It's a game-changer.

31:55.814 --> 31:59.551
But in the wrong hands,
you can make a fortune.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.253
Let me put it this way.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.956
Whoever gets their hands
on Kelekona

32:03.956 --> 32:06.558
controls the financial markets.

32:06.558 --> 32:09.828
Remy, can I have a word?

32:09.828 --> 32:11.330
- Excuse us.
- Thank you.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.534
I got one of my contacts
at the CIA

32:15.534 --> 32:17.369
to look into Gavin Brisker,
and according to their intel,

32:17.369 --> 32:20.506
he works exclusively
for the Chinese government.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.509
So if he took Graham...
- It's on their orders.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.944
Gavin's contact is Lao Tsun,
special attaché

32:25.944 --> 32:27.279
at the Chinese Embassy.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.515
He also spent 25 years
with the MSS,

32:29.515 --> 32:31.183
their version of the CIA.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.151
So he's a spy?

32:32.151 --> 32:33.785
With diplomatic immunity.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.354
- Anybody got eyes on him?
- No.

32:35.354 --> 32:36.955
He left the embassy
two days ago.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.390
MIA ever since.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.825
He's going to meet
Gavin Brisker.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.327
To get Kelekona.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.961
And once the Chinese
have their hands on it,

32:42.961 --> 32:44.096
they won't need Graham.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.831
Right.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.868
As you know,
my country has banned

32:49.868 --> 32:52.538
all forms of cryptocurrencies.

32:52.538 --> 32:53.805
Too volatile.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.307
Too many players.

32:55.307 --> 33:00.946
But with Kelekona, we not only
become the market leader,

33:00.946 --> 33:05.351
we also make trillions
licensing it to the world.

33:05.351 --> 33:10.056
But you covered your tracks
very well, Mr. Solinder.

33:10.056 --> 33:12.958
You were smart
to hide your identity.

33:12.958 --> 33:17.663
Even smarter to get 200 coders
to work on Kelekona

33:17.663 --> 33:19.498
without their knowledge.

33:19.498 --> 33:24.503
But unfortunately,
it's how we caught you--

33:24.503 --> 33:27.273
through one of your coders
in Taiwan.

33:30.142 --> 33:33.912
I need the 128-bit password.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.017
I--I don't have it.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.486
Yes, you do.

33:40.486 --> 33:42.020
I don't.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.290
I swear to you.

33:44.290 --> 33:47.793
I've never had it.
It's how I protect myself.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.095
Then who does?

33:53.099 --> 33:54.366
I can't tell you that.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.405
We'll see about that.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.643
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:04.643 --> 34:07.113
What are you doing?

34:07.113 --> 34:08.747
Put me down. No!
No, no, no, no, no.

34:08.747 --> 34:09.915
Wait a second. Wait a second.

34:09.915 --> 34:11.750
I'll give you anything else. Anything.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.153
No! No! No! No!

34:23.962 --> 34:28.567
<i>I need the p--
passwords for Kelekona.</i>

34:29.968 --> 34:31.203
<i>Please.</i>

34:31.203 --> 34:34.206
<i>I--I want--
I want to see my son.</i>

34:34.206 --> 34:35.707
<i>You have three hours.</i>

34:35.707 --> 34:37.309
<i>I have sent you instructions.</i>

34:37.309 --> 34:40.479
<i>His life is in your hands.</i>

34:40.479 --> 34:42.013
<i>Video was emailed
directly to us.</i>

34:42.013 --> 34:44.350
<i>CIA confirmed the voice
of Lao Tsun,</i>

34:44.350 --> 34:46.285
<i>attaché at the
Chinese Embassy.</i>

34:46.285 --> 34:47.619
Do we know where they are?

34:47.619 --> 34:48.954
IP from the email was linked

34:48.954 --> 34:50.456
to a dormant account
in New Zealand,

34:50.456 --> 34:51.890
and there's nothing
from the video metadata.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.892
Have you located
the password?

34:53.892 --> 34:57.095
We've searched Graham's home,
offices, hard drives.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.697
<i>So you don't have it?</i>

34:58.697 --> 35:00.999
- We still have two hours.
<i>- No, you don't.</i>

35:00.999 --> 35:04.002
<i>There's not gonna be
any trade.</i>

35:04.002 --> 35:07.005
Last time I checked, Treasury
isn't running this operation.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.940
And the Chinese
are not gonna get their hands

35:08.940 --> 35:10.542
on a system that would tip
the world's economy

35:10.542 --> 35:12.010
<i>in their favor.</i>

35:12.010 --> 35:15.046
That's a direct quote
from the secretary of state.

35:15.046 --> 35:17.015
So we're just gonna
turn our back on this guy

35:17.015 --> 35:18.417
for a piece of code?

35:18.417 --> 35:21.520
<i>Freedom doesn't come
without sacrifice.</i>

35:21.520 --> 35:23.689
You're going along
with this, Isobel?

35:23.689 --> 35:25.391
Both agencies are aligned.

35:25.391 --> 35:27.493
This is a man's life
at stake here.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.094
He has a son!

35:29.094 --> 35:31.797
<i>You need to stand down
from this operation.</i>

35:31.797 --> 35:33.465
<i>Is that understood?</i>

35:33.465 --> 35:35.234
This is on you.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.968
Jackass.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.372
So what now?

35:40.372 --> 35:41.507
We start over.

35:41.507 --> 35:42.674
Search everything again.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.210
Homes, computers, hard drives.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.411
We've searched everywhere.

35:45.411 --> 35:47.946
Then we try harder!

35:47.946 --> 35:50.249
I'll be damned if I'm
giving up on this guy.

35:50.249 --> 35:52.551
Guys, come here.

35:52.551 --> 35:53.885
I told him everything.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.387
As soon as
I mentioned Kelekona,

35:55.387 --> 35:57.523
he started writing
this sequence.

35:57.523 --> 35:58.790
What is this?

35:58.790 --> 35:59.925
It's the password
for Kelekona.

35:59.925 --> 36:02.694
My dad told me to memorize it.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.897
If we give it to them,
can we get my dad back?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.537
That's amazing, Dante, but...

36:11.537 --> 36:13.171
it's a little more complicated
than that.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.709
The Chinese government
wants Kelekona,

36:17.709 --> 36:19.478
but our government doesn't
wanna give it to them.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.785
We don't have to.

36:35.126 --> 36:36.528
Are you sure this
is gonna work?

36:36.528 --> 36:39.465
Only one way to find out.

36:56.482 --> 36:57.616
You have what I want?

37:01.186 --> 37:02.888
I wanna see him first.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.337
I thought we agreed.

37:18.337 --> 37:19.505
Just us.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.039
Everything's under control.

37:22.508 --> 37:24.075
Winston Hill from Treasury.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.811
You're not making this trade.
- Hey, look, man, take it easy.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.579
I'm here on direct orders
from Secretary Hornacek.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.714
Agent Scott!
- Get back!

37:28.714 --> 37:30.081
- Hey, do not do this!
- Hey!

37:30.081 --> 37:31.249
Do not do this!

37:31.249 --> 37:32.651
You're gonna
get someone killed.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.886
Tell him to stand down.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.423
Everybody will get what
they want if we just be cool.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.272
Thank you.

38:27.272 --> 38:28.940
Thank you so much.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.076
I'm not the one
you need to thank.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.085
Dad!

38:44.022 --> 38:45.624
- I love you, Dante.
- I love you too.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.926
I love you so much.

38:51.129 --> 38:53.399
Secretary Hornacek
is calling the director.

38:53.399 --> 38:54.766
You disobeyed a direct order.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.267
No, I didn't.

38:56.267 --> 38:57.969
You were specifically told
not to give them Kelekona.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.037
I just saw you do it.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.640
What they have is worthless.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.109
Tell them, Dante.

39:04.109 --> 39:06.645
I hacked
the Kelekona website.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.514
I embedded a virus
which activates

39:08.514 --> 39:09.815
when you input the password.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.249
Every time they type it in,

39:11.249 --> 39:13.752
it will start
to corrupt itself.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.521
They won't be able to stop it.

39:15.521 --> 39:18.890
It'll keep corrupting itself
until it all implodes.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.592
So--so Kelekona is dead?

39:20.592 --> 39:22.260
No.

39:22.260 --> 39:24.763
My dad always told me
to keep copies.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.632
Always be safe.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.700
So I did.

39:30.469 --> 39:31.937
It's all on here.

39:34.272 --> 39:35.240
You can look.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.678
I don't have to.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.179
You're amazing.

39:44.450 --> 39:46.685
Dante saved the day.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.820
Right, Dante?
- Thank you.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.395
Hey.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.766
I brought you back
Mikey's things.

40:00.766 --> 40:04.736
Kept a couple of photos,
hope you don't mind.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.038
All good.

40:07.038 --> 40:10.141
- Did you read the letter?
- What letter?

40:10.141 --> 40:12.511
Oh.
I never check that mail.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.012
I know.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.721
Florida Commission
on Offender Review?

40:22.721 --> 40:24.389
I got the same one.
So did Mom.

40:26.224 --> 40:30.161
Larry Michael Davis is up for
conditional medical release.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.697
What?

40:31.697 --> 40:34.165
Why?
- He has cancer.

40:34.165 --> 40:37.636
There's a hearing
in Tallahassee next week.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.070
I don't care what he has.

40:39.070 --> 40:40.472
He killed our brother.

40:40.472 --> 40:42.107
Stabbed him three times
for 18 bucks.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.475
He's not getting out.

40:43.475 --> 40:45.010
No way. Over my dead body.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.048
What, you don't agree?

40:50.048 --> 40:52.050
He served 25 years, Remy.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.385
He's paid his debt.

40:54.385 --> 40:56.688
The last thing I wanna do
is go down to Florida

40:56.688 --> 40:59.691
and relive
that nightmare again.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.860
I don't think
we should oppose it.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.294
Are you serious right now?

41:05.463 --> 41:07.866
I just want Mikey
to have peace, I--

41:09.034 --> 41:10.836
I want us to have peace.

41:12.671 --> 41:15.707
Do what you want.
I'm going to Florida.
