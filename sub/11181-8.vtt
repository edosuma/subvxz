00:23.195 --> 00:25.784
Fish don't fryin the kitchen

00:25.784 --> 00:28.580
Beans don't burnon the grill

00:28.580 --> 00:31.272
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.272 --> 00:33.723
Just to get up that hill

00:33.723 --> 00:36.519
Now we're upin
the big leagues

00:36.519 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.108 --> 00:41.696
As long as we
live,it's you and me, baby

00:41.696 --> 00:43.388
There ain't

And seventeen.
Seventeen.

01:12.313 --> 01:14.453
Eighteen.
Eighteen.

01:14.453 --> 01:17.939
Don't bend your knees.
Okay.

01:17.939 --> 01:19.458
Nineteen.
Nineteen.

01:20.252 --> 01:21.667
Twenty.
Twenty.

01:24.291 --> 01:26.810
I didn't bend my knees.

01:26.810 --> 01:29.951
Okay, just lie down there
for a minute and relax.

01:29.951 --> 01:31.712
Now that I can do!

01:31.712 --> 01:33.714
Honestly, girl, you'll
feel like a new person

01:33.714 --> 01:35.785
as soon as we work our
way through this book.

01:35.785 --> 01:39.099
Tomorrow I'll show you
how to do your own facial.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.136
Facial?
Sure, it's good
for your skin.

01:42.136 --> 01:45.864
Why don't you show me
how you can get us
a couple of cold drinks?

01:45.864 --> 01:47.555
Coming right up.

01:58.221 --> 01:59.671
Oh, my God, Weezy!

02:00.948 --> 02:02.950
Weezy!
Talk to me, Weezy!

02:03.778 --> 02:06.126
Hello, George.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.679
What are you doing?

02:07.679 --> 02:09.232
Exercising.

02:09.232 --> 02:11.131
Exercising? You call
laying on the floor,

02:11.131 --> 02:14.410
scaring the hell out
of me "exercising"?

02:14.410 --> 02:16.964
Well, right now
I'm relaxing.

02:18.483 --> 02:19.587
Well, do me a favor,
will you?

02:19.587 --> 02:21.693
Next time you relax,
keep on moving!

02:23.039 --> 02:24.627
Hello, Mr. J.
I'm off!

02:24.627 --> 02:26.974
I've known that for
a long time, Bentley.

02:28.355 --> 02:29.839
George...

02:29.839 --> 02:32.738
Oh, no. I mean,
I'm off to the mountains
for the weekend.

02:32.738 --> 02:34.395
Come in, Mr. Bentley.

02:36.363 --> 02:38.330
Oh, hi, George,
Mr. Bentley.

02:38.330 --> 02:41.057
What is this? I got
weirdoes coming out of every
door!

02:42.783 --> 02:45.579
Who's hiding in the
bathroom, the tidy bowl man?

02:46.787 --> 02:51.930
Louise and I were
exercising together.
Ha-ha!

02:51.930 --> 02:54.381
Ah, you ever
try this one?

02:54.381 --> 02:56.245
What will that
do for me?

02:56.245 --> 02:58.695
It'll take you back up to
your own apartment.

03:00.076 --> 03:02.699
I guess we can finish
later, Louise.

03:02.699 --> 03:05.564
Meanwhile, maybe you can
teach George some exercises

03:05.564 --> 03:07.014
to improve
his coordination.

03:07.014 --> 03:10.224
Coordination?
Are you jiving?
I got perfect coordination.

03:10.224 --> 03:14.746
I'm talking about the
coordination between your
brain and your mouth.

03:16.644 --> 03:18.336
What are you doing
here, anyway, Bentley?

03:18.336 --> 03:21.270
Your wife promised
to babysit my plants
while I'm gone.

03:21.270 --> 03:23.479
Here are my apartment
keys, Mrs. J.

03:23.479 --> 03:26.654
I can't tell you
how wonderful it is
to be getting away.

03:26.654 --> 03:28.346
Oh, you can't, huh?
Well, good! Bye!

03:28.346 --> 03:30.831
Ah! The cascading streams,

03:30.831 --> 03:31.970
the scent of the pines.

03:31.970 --> 03:33.903
The beauty of Virginia.

03:33.903 --> 03:36.871
Isn't Virginia
a little far away
just for the weekend?

03:36.871 --> 03:38.977
Oh, no. Virginia's
in New Jersey.

03:38.977 --> 03:40.358
It is?

03:40.358 --> 03:42.325
Oh, I don't mean
the state of Virginia.

03:42.325 --> 03:44.085
I mean my friend Virginia.

03:44.085 --> 03:45.466
Although,
come to think of it,

03:45.466 --> 03:47.399
she's in a lovely
state, too!

03:48.711 --> 03:51.403
We're going camping
together in
the Adirondacks.

03:51.403 --> 03:53.923
Oh, that sounds
like fun.

03:53.923 --> 03:55.649
Not for Virginia.

03:58.755 --> 04:00.170
Ah! Hey, Marcus!
Hey, Marcus!

04:00.170 --> 04:01.655
Hey, everybody.

04:01.655 --> 04:02.725
Come in.

04:02.725 --> 04:05.210
Hey, Marcus!
How's my best
new employee?

04:05.210 --> 04:09.041
I don't know how he is,
Boss. But I'm fine.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.148
I just figured I'd
drop off this cleaning
before I go home.

04:12.148 --> 04:13.736
Thanks, Marcus.

04:13.736 --> 04:15.807
Well, Marcus how do
you find your job?

04:15.807 --> 04:17.705
I just jump off the bus,

04:17.705 --> 04:22.365
walk down the street
till I come to a sign that
says, "Jefferson Cleaners".

04:22.365 --> 04:24.160
Just jiving you, Mr. Bentley.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.679
My job is going great.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.509
And, Mrs. Jefferson,

04:28.509 --> 04:30.615
I really appreciate
you and them people
at the Help Center

04:30.615 --> 04:32.375
for getting me this
part-time work.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.964
Mmm!
Oh, don't thank me.

04:34.964 --> 04:38.070
That's right, thank me.
I'm the one who's paying you.

04:39.071 --> 04:42.074
Oh! Why the big boots,
Mr. Bentley?

04:42.074 --> 04:43.559
You going
cockroach killing?

04:45.250 --> 04:47.597
Oh, no, I don't believe
in blood sports.

04:47.597 --> 04:49.668
But I'm going to be
doing a lot of hiking
this weekend.

04:49.668 --> 04:50.773
Yeah?

04:50.773 --> 04:53.879
Oh, yes. I hope to log
20 miles on my pedometer.

04:53.879 --> 04:56.399
You're taking
a motorbike?

04:56.399 --> 04:58.159
No, Mr. J.
A pedometer is
an instrument

04:58.159 --> 04:59.816
that measures how far
you've walked.

04:59.816 --> 05:00.852
You see?

05:00.852 --> 05:02.923
Huh, does that thing
really work?

05:02.923 --> 05:04.580
Oh, yes.
It's quite accurate.

05:04.580 --> 05:06.996
You think it could measure
how far it is from here to
the elevator?

05:08.515 --> 05:12.104
Most definitely!
It's exactly...

05:18.041 --> 05:19.560
Where is
Mr. Bentley going?

05:19.560 --> 05:22.045
he's going camping in
the Adirondacks.

05:22.045 --> 05:23.840
Camping? Oh,
that sounds great.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.670
Oh, you like camping,
Marcus?

05:25.670 --> 05:28.086
I don't know.
I ain't never been.

05:28.086 --> 05:30.019
Oh, that's a shame.
Yeah.

05:30.019 --> 05:33.263
My dad promised to
take me camping on
my birthday last year.

05:33.263 --> 05:35.611
But we never went.

05:35.611 --> 05:38.476
I had my heart
all set on it, too.

05:38.476 --> 05:42.238
Hey, how would you like to
have a piece of Florence's
upside-down cake?

05:42.238 --> 05:43.584
Sure, Mrs. Jefferson.

05:43.584 --> 05:45.517
You go and cut yourself
a big piece.

05:45.517 --> 05:47.105
Florence left the cake
on the counter,

05:47.105 --> 05:49.487
and there's a knife and
fork in the drawer.
All right!

05:49.487 --> 05:52.697
And if that don't work,
there's a hammer and
a saw in the closet!

05:56.425 --> 05:59.255
Oh, I feel sorry
for Marcus.

05:59.255 --> 06:01.671
Me, too. Having to eat
Florence's cooking? Ugh.

06:03.397 --> 06:06.296
Can't you see how much
he wants to go camping?

06:06.296 --> 06:09.610
So?
Well, nobody will take him.

06:09.610 --> 06:12.475
Shoot, we all out
of Scotch.

06:12.475 --> 06:14.995
I wish there was
something I could do.

06:14.995 --> 06:17.377
There is.
Find me some Scotch.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.654
Maybe we could
ask Mr. Bentley.

06:18.654 --> 06:20.552
Hey, that's right,
Bentley drinks Scotch!

06:20.552 --> 06:22.036
Give me his key!

06:23.831 --> 06:25.281
No, George!

06:25.281 --> 06:27.317
I meant,
maybe Mr. Bentley

06:27.317 --> 06:29.423
would take him camping
with him sometime.
Oh.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.563
Or maybe you
could take him.
Me?

06:31.563 --> 06:34.221
Yeah, why not?
'Cause I hate camping.

06:34.221 --> 06:36.361
When have you been
camping before?

06:36.361 --> 06:38.570
Never. Why should I
do something I hate?

06:39.778 --> 06:41.228
But, George...
Look, Weezy.

06:41.228 --> 06:43.989
If Marcus wants to go
camping, tell him to ask
his father to take him.

06:43.989 --> 06:46.682
His father's already
broken one promise.

06:46.682 --> 06:49.374
He's probably too busy
to take him camping,

06:49.374 --> 06:51.618
just like you were
when Lionel was a kid.

06:51.618 --> 06:54.414
I wasn't too busy,
I was too broke.

06:56.761 --> 06:58.832
Well, you're not
too broke now.

06:58.832 --> 07:00.420
No, now I'm too smart!

07:03.630 --> 07:06.115
Look, you've got
the time and the money.

07:06.115 --> 07:08.428
You could take him
camping if you wanted to.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.189
If I wanted to!
So let's forget it!

07:13.225 --> 07:15.262
I think you're being
very selfish!

07:15.262 --> 07:17.954
No, I ain't!
And I don't wanna hear
no more about it!

07:17.954 --> 07:19.404
Yeah? Who's this?

07:19.404 --> 07:21.924
Oh, hi, Mama!
How are you?

07:26.238 --> 07:30.104
Man, Mrs. Jefferson,
this cake is real good!

07:30.104 --> 07:31.623
I hope it won't
spoil your dinner.

07:31.623 --> 07:34.557
No, my mom does that
when she cooks it.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.492
Well, I better get going.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.460
Are you working
tomorrow, Marcus?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.945
Yeah. I got to be
there at 9:00.

07:42.945 --> 07:44.774
Uh, no, you don't!

07:44.774 --> 07:47.605
I don't?
You firing me?

07:47.605 --> 07:50.470
No, I'm giving you
the day off.
You and me going camping!

07:50.470 --> 07:51.609
You are?

07:51.609 --> 07:52.955
For real?

07:52.955 --> 07:55.647
We going up to
the mountains?
Right on!

07:55.647 --> 07:58.408
Well, all right!

08:02.171 --> 08:03.621
See that, Weezy?

08:03.621 --> 08:05.139
I told you
he'd like the idea.

08:05.139 --> 08:08.453
But, Boss, are you sure
that you and me
can handle it up there?

08:08.453 --> 08:11.111
I mean, I don't know
nothing about no camping, do
you?

08:11.111 --> 08:12.561
Sure I do.

08:12.561 --> 08:14.079
You do?

08:14.079 --> 08:16.426
Ain't nothing to it!
All you gotta do is drive
up to the woods,

08:16.426 --> 08:18.670
park your car, get out
and walk until you
find some grass

08:18.670 --> 08:20.223
and then sit down!

08:23.917 --> 08:26.298
And I thought
you didn't know anything
about camping!

08:27.299 --> 08:28.922
Well, what about it,
Marcus?

08:28.922 --> 08:31.545
Okay, if you're sure
you want to do this.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.167
Sure I'm sure! Look,

08:33.167 --> 08:35.342
we'll go and rent us some
camping equipment
before the stores close.

08:35.342 --> 08:38.310
See you later, Weez.
Bye, Mrs. Jefferson.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.554
George...
What?

08:40.554 --> 08:43.937
I don't know what
changed your mind,
but you're wonderful.

08:43.937 --> 08:46.318
Well, Weezy, you know,
if Marcus wants
to go camping,

08:46.318 --> 08:47.941
somebody oughta take him.

08:47.941 --> 08:50.012
Oh, I almost forgot.
What?

08:50.012 --> 08:52.221
That was Mama
on the phone.

08:52.221 --> 08:54.395
She's having her apartment
painted tomorrow.

08:54.395 --> 08:56.018
So?

08:56.018 --> 08:58.917
So I told her she could
come over and spend
the weekend with us.

09:03.025 --> 09:04.923
With us?

09:04.923 --> 09:06.546
But you're going camping!

09:06.546 --> 09:08.306
Oh, that's right!

09:09.859 --> 09:11.792
What a shame!

09:11.792 --> 09:14.899
Well, I guess I have to
miss out on all the fun.

09:14.899 --> 09:18.005
But never mind, Weez,
you and Mama have
a good time together!

09:33.711 --> 09:36.161
You sure you know how to
do this, Mr. Jefferson?

09:36.161 --> 09:37.784
Of course I'm sure!

09:37.784 --> 09:40.165
Ain't nothin' to it.
All you gotta do is keep
these two poles tight.

09:40.165 --> 09:42.271
Take out some of
the slack on your end.

09:42.271 --> 09:44.376
Any idiot can
put up a tent.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.171
Any... Hey!

09:49.589 --> 09:50.590
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.384
Please! I know what
I'm doing here!

09:52.384 --> 09:54.455
I don't think it's
supposed to do that, Mr.
Jefferson.

09:54.455 --> 09:56.596
Ain't no tent gonna
beat George Jefferson!

10:00.600 --> 10:01.670
Gosh.

10:03.188 --> 10:04.673
I'll do it later.

10:04.673 --> 10:07.020
Maybe instead of sleeping
in it, we can sleep on it.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.470
We don't even
need no tent.

10:09.470 --> 10:12.094
Real campers sleep
under the stars.

10:12.094 --> 10:13.474
Look, there's a full moon.

10:15.062 --> 10:17.064
Full moon?

10:17.064 --> 10:18.894
That'll give more light
for the cougars!

10:18.894 --> 10:20.136
Cougars?
What you talkin' about?

10:20.136 --> 10:22.414
They don't allow
no automobiles up here!

10:26.280 --> 10:27.661
I meant mountain lions.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.698
Lions? What are you
talking like that for?

10:29.698 --> 10:31.976
I'm sorry, Boss,
I didn't mean to scare you.

10:31.976 --> 10:35.393
Scare me?
You can't scare me with
no mountain lion talk.

10:35.393 --> 10:38.499
Why don't you go on out
there and get some wood
so we can build a campfire?

10:39.846 --> 10:41.675
Me?

10:42.676 --> 10:44.436
Go in there?

10:44.436 --> 10:46.507
Well, you're supposed
to be so big and bad.

10:47.923 --> 10:49.096
Right.

10:56.586 --> 10:59.935
Maybe I'll get lucky
and run into a Girl Scout.

10:59.935 --> 11:02.040
Well, if you do,
bring me back
some cookies!

11:08.288 --> 11:09.738
Mountain lion!

11:09.738 --> 11:12.913
Mountain lions live in
mountains, not in trees!

11:13.845 --> 11:15.398
What's that?

11:22.267 --> 11:24.925
Oh, huh! A pine cone.
You lucky!

11:28.446 --> 11:31.104
Oh, give me a home

11:31.104 --> 11:34.245
Where the buffalo roam

11:34.245 --> 11:37.697
Where the deer
and the cantaloupe play

11:43.633 --> 11:45.256
Howdy.

11:45.256 --> 11:47.051
What's the big idea?

11:47.051 --> 11:48.984
Sneaking up on me
and scaring the hell
out of me like that?

11:48.984 --> 11:51.400
Sorry, pal.
Force of habit.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.437
When you're hunting,
you gotta learn
to move quiet.

11:54.437 --> 11:58.062
Well, there ain't no
animals around here, so you
might as well just keep moving.

11:58.062 --> 11:59.926
Barney Hunter.

11:59.926 --> 12:01.272
George, dry cleaner.

12:07.692 --> 12:10.419
No, my last name's Hunter,
Barney Hunter.

12:10.419 --> 12:13.008
Oh.
You a city boy?

12:13.008 --> 12:14.699
Who you calling "boy"?

12:18.254 --> 12:20.532
I mean, you're from
the city, ain't you?

12:20.532 --> 12:22.189
Yeah, how'd you know?

12:22.189 --> 12:24.502
Well, there ain't
many of you folks
around these parts.

12:24.502 --> 12:26.400
And what do you mean
by "you folks"?

12:28.230 --> 12:29.610
Dry cleaners.

12:33.649 --> 12:35.962
Be quiet!
What? What is it? What?

12:35.962 --> 12:37.170
Don't move!

12:37.170 --> 12:38.688
Don't shoot!

12:40.104 --> 12:42.347
I ain't got no money!

12:42.347 --> 12:44.694
Oh, it's all right.
It's just Marcus.
Oh.

12:44.694 --> 12:47.180
Sorry, but you could've
been something.

12:47.180 --> 12:48.664
Yeah, dead!

12:49.838 --> 12:52.633
Boss!

12:52.633 --> 12:55.257
Man, you wouldn't believe
what just happened!
What?

12:55.257 --> 12:57.362
I was out there
pickin' up some wood,

12:57.362 --> 12:59.364
and something ran by me!
What was it?

12:59.364 --> 13:00.987
I didn't stick around
to ask!

13:02.540 --> 13:04.369
All I know is,
I heard it growl!

13:04.369 --> 13:06.578
Aw, just probably a wolf.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.718
Wolf?
A wolf?

13:08.718 --> 13:11.825
There're plenty of 'em
round these parts.
Ain't nothing to be scared of.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.516
Hear that, Marcus?
There ain't nothing
to be scared of.

13:13.516 --> 13:14.517
Yeah.

13:14.517 --> 13:16.726
Well, I'll be
gettin' on home.

13:16.726 --> 13:17.831
You live around here?

13:17.831 --> 13:20.765
Yeah, I have a cabin about
three miles from here.

13:20.765 --> 13:23.112
Ain't nothin' better than
livin' in the woods.

13:23.112 --> 13:25.011
That's what I keep
telling Marcus.

13:25.011 --> 13:26.564
I'm livin' back in
the old city.

13:26.564 --> 13:29.118
Look, if you're ever down
that way, look me up under
Jefferson Cleaners.

13:29.118 --> 13:31.155
Thanks, but there ain't
much chance of that.

13:31.155 --> 13:33.295
I ain't been to the city
in a coon's age.

13:39.888 --> 13:41.959
I mean, in a long time.

13:43.546 --> 13:46.653
Well, take care of
yourselves, you hear?

13:46.653 --> 13:48.068
GEORGE: Uh-huh.

13:56.387 --> 13:58.251
We better get this
fire started, Boss,

13:58.251 --> 14:00.115
or we're gonna
freeze to death.

14:04.257 --> 14:07.432
This is fun out here,
ain't it, Marcus?

14:09.918 --> 14:11.712
It is?

14:11.712 --> 14:13.680
Well, at least it's better
than being at home.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.372
Mama's probably driving
Weezy crazy right now.

14:20.790 --> 14:22.931
Ah, isn't this
fun, Louise,

14:22.931 --> 14:25.209
having the whole weekend
to ourselves?

14:25.209 --> 14:26.762
No Tom, no George...

14:26.762 --> 14:28.729
LOUISE:
No Mother Jefferson.

14:28.729 --> 14:32.802
I'm so glad
she didn't come for
the weekend after all.

14:32.802 --> 14:34.597
LOUISE: Helen!
Hmm?

14:34.597 --> 14:37.635
How long do I have to
keep this on?

14:42.191 --> 14:45.332
Oh, just let it set
for two or three days.

14:46.506 --> 14:48.232
Two or three days?

14:48.232 --> 14:50.372
Just kidding, girl.

14:50.372 --> 14:53.513
Let the mask set
for ten minutes,
then wash it off.

14:53.513 --> 14:56.067
Just don't laugh,
or your face'll crack!

14:57.379 --> 14:59.208
I just hope
it all comes off.

15:02.108 --> 15:04.696
If George ever saw
me like this,

15:04.696 --> 15:06.112
he'd turn white.

15:08.045 --> 15:09.494
Hello...

15:10.461 --> 15:11.945
Mrs. Jefferson?

15:11.945 --> 15:13.843
Hi, Ralph.

15:13.843 --> 15:15.155
Is your husband here?

15:15.155 --> 15:16.950
No, he's out of town.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.676
Out of town?

15:18.676 --> 15:21.299
That's a shame.
Why?

15:21.299 --> 15:25.441
Well, Stevie Wonder is
giving a benefit concert
at Lincoln Center tonight.

15:25.441 --> 15:27.271
I know.
George tried to
get tickets,

15:27.271 --> 15:29.376
but they are sold out.
Exactly.

15:29.376 --> 15:32.483
Only he mentioned to me
if I could get my hands
on two tickets,

15:32.483 --> 15:34.934
he'd make it
worth my while.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.797
But since he's not here...

15:36.797 --> 15:38.316
Wait, Ralph.

15:38.316 --> 15:40.629
You have two tickets
for Stevie Wonder's
concert?

15:40.629 --> 15:42.079
Yes, ma'am.

15:43.528 --> 15:47.532
You'll never know what
I went through
to get theses tickets.

15:47.532 --> 15:49.155
I pleaded with
other doormen,

15:49.155 --> 15:52.503
phoned a lot of scalpers,
tried to bribe a cabbie...

15:52.503 --> 15:54.022
Well...

15:54.022 --> 15:56.472
I guess I'll find someone
who could use them.

15:56.472 --> 15:59.130
You just did.
Helen, you wanna go?

15:59.130 --> 16:02.237
Do I? I'd love to.

16:02.237 --> 16:05.309
How much did Mr. Jefferson
say he'd give you
for the tickets, Ralph?

16:05.309 --> 16:06.517
He didn't, ma'am.

16:06.517 --> 16:09.313
But then you know how
generous Mr. Jefferson is.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.247
I guess you don't.

16:16.906 --> 16:18.494
Two of the best
seats in the house.

16:18.494 --> 16:21.739
There must be plenty of
people who'd love to get
their hands on these.

16:21.739 --> 16:23.603
That's it, Ralph.

16:26.399 --> 16:28.504
Well, as a favor to
you, Mrs. Jefferson.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.368
Thanks a lot, Ralph.

16:30.368 --> 16:32.439
Mrs. Jefferson,
your face...

16:32.439 --> 16:34.890
I know, Ralph.
It's white.

16:34.890 --> 16:37.065
No, it's cracked.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.004
Stevie Wonder!

16:45.004 --> 16:48.283
Oh, George is going to be
so mad he missed it.

16:53.529 --> 16:55.704
Hey, girl, you can really
get down...

16:56.774 --> 16:58.155
For a honky.

17:08.682 --> 17:10.201
Don't you just love
it out here, Marcus?

17:10.201 --> 17:12.065
No traffic.

17:12.721 --> 17:14.067
No bathrooms.

17:16.690 --> 17:19.383
No customers complaining
about their cleaning.

17:19.383 --> 17:22.731
No place to buy
a nice, hot hamburger.

17:22.731 --> 17:24.250
No Willis'!

17:25.492 --> 17:28.150
Nobody to help us
if something happens.

17:28.150 --> 17:30.911
Something happens?
Like what?
Well...

17:30.911 --> 17:34.225
Like some wild animal
coming after us.
Like a bear.

17:34.225 --> 17:36.779
Oh, is that all?
You ain't got to
worry about that.

17:36.779 --> 17:39.230
'Cause if a bear comes
around here,
I know exactly what to do.

17:39.230 --> 17:41.301
You do? What?

17:41.301 --> 17:45.892
We just throw it one of
them meat loaf sandwiches
Florence made for us.

17:45.892 --> 17:48.481
If that don't kill it,
nothing will!

17:50.517 --> 17:54.694
You know, Mr. Jefferson,
you're a real nice guy.

17:54.694 --> 17:56.592
I mean, taking me
camping like this.

17:56.592 --> 17:58.732
Well, maybe if you
tell your father how much
you enjoyed this,

17:58.732 --> 18:00.803
he'll take
you sometime.
Hmm.

18:00.803 --> 18:02.529
Ain't no chance of that.

18:02.529 --> 18:03.944
Sure there is.

18:03.944 --> 18:05.429
No, there ain't.

18:05.429 --> 18:07.741
Look, maybe he had
a good reason for not
taking you before.

18:07.741 --> 18:09.433
You ever think of that?

18:10.779 --> 18:12.229
He died, man.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.027
Your father's dead?

18:18.027 --> 18:21.962
He died two weeks before
my last birthday.

18:21.962 --> 18:24.517
And you're still mad
at him for not taking
you camping?

18:26.691 --> 18:27.968
You don't understand.

18:27.968 --> 18:30.937
No, I understand.
You're the one
who don't understand!

18:30.937 --> 18:32.559
What?

18:32.559 --> 18:34.734
You ain't mad at your father
for not taking you camping,

18:34.734 --> 18:36.770
you're mad at him
for dying!

18:36.770 --> 18:38.600
That's bull, man!

18:38.600 --> 18:41.223
You don't know what it's
like having an old man

18:41.223 --> 18:42.431
who makes all
kinds of promises

18:42.431 --> 18:45.296
but don't stick around
to keep none of 'em.

18:45.296 --> 18:47.333
What kind of promises?

18:47.333 --> 18:50.059
Well, like
playing baseball.

18:50.059 --> 18:53.787
I remember lots of times
when I was a kid,
I used to sit on the stoop

18:53.787 --> 18:56.307
with my old raggedy mitt,
waitin' for my old man

18:56.307 --> 18:59.138
to come home
so we could play catch.

18:59.138 --> 19:03.383
But when he did come
home, on time,

19:03.383 --> 19:05.282
he was so tired
from loading them
fruit trucks,

19:05.282 --> 19:08.699
he could barely
make it down the sidewalk.

19:08.699 --> 19:11.184
I asked him to play
catch with me,

19:11.184 --> 19:13.704
but he just didn't have
enough energy left.

19:15.084 --> 19:17.501
He'd sit me on his knee
and say, "Marcus,

19:19.227 --> 19:22.644
"one of these days
things are gonna
get better.

19:22.644 --> 19:27.407
"And me and you
gonna have all kinds
of time to play ball.

19:27.407 --> 19:29.927
"I promise."

19:29.927 --> 19:32.964
Things never
did get better.

19:32.964 --> 19:36.865
Marcus, look...
And all I got left
is an old baseball mitt

19:36.865 --> 19:38.591
and a bunch of
broken promises.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.939
Marcus, I know where
you're comin' from.

19:41.939 --> 19:44.666
My old man died
when I was ten.

19:44.666 --> 19:46.633
He did?
Yeah.

19:46.633 --> 19:49.188
And he made a lot of
promises to me he never
had time to keep.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.190
Weren't you mad
about that?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.261
Sure I was, at first.

19:53.261 --> 19:57.886
But then I realized he
didn't really believe he'd be
able to keep those promises.

19:57.886 --> 20:00.475
And your old man probably
didn't believe it either.

20:00.475 --> 20:02.304
Then why'd he
lie to me?

20:02.304 --> 20:05.031
He didn't lie to you.

20:05.031 --> 20:06.446
I mean, he had to
make those promises

20:06.446 --> 20:09.242
so you'd have something
to look forward to.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.658
'Cause without promises
of things getting better,

20:11.658 --> 20:13.488
you wouldn't have had
anything to go on.

20:13.488 --> 20:15.559
And your old man wouldn't
have had nothing to keep
him going, either.

20:15.559 --> 20:17.561
But he shouldn't have
made no promises, man,

20:17.561 --> 20:19.770
if he knew they wasn't
gonna come true.

20:19.770 --> 20:22.600
What are you talkin' bout?
Them promises can still
come true.

20:23.049 --> 20:24.326
How?

20:25.189 --> 20:27.433
Well, it ain't easy, but,

20:27.433 --> 20:30.125
it's up to you to work at
it and make 'em come true.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.955
I mean, your old man
died tryin'.

20:32.955 --> 20:35.682
Or else you could just
sit around
blaming your father,

20:35.682 --> 20:38.375
which ain't gonna change
nothin', which is stupid!

20:42.033 --> 20:43.518
Mr. Jefferson...

20:43.518 --> 20:46.003
Hey, look what you're doing!
You burned your marshmallow.

20:46.003 --> 20:47.418
Here.

20:48.523 --> 20:50.490
Huh! Reminds me
of the Willis'!

20:55.288 --> 20:56.703
You need a new stick.

21:08.681 --> 21:11.580
I'm gonna make those
promises good, Dad.

21:14.169 --> 21:15.964
I promise.

21:24.869 --> 21:27.044
Hey, you all right?

21:28.217 --> 21:30.599
I'm fine.

21:30.599 --> 21:32.705
I just got some
smoke in my eyes.

21:35.224 --> 21:37.365
Enjoying yourself?
Yeah.

21:38.952 --> 21:40.989
You know, this camping
ain't half bad.

21:45.787 --> 21:49.100
It ain't
half good, neither!

21:49.100 --> 21:52.207
You know, I just thought
of a better place
to pitch our camp.

21:52.207 --> 21:53.519
Where's that?

21:53.519 --> 21:54.692
The nearest motel!

21:55.900 --> 21:57.730
All right!

21:57.730 --> 21:59.559
GEORGE: Help!

22:03.736 --> 22:06.255
Oh, I feel great, Helen.

22:06.255 --> 22:08.465
This weekend really
did me good.

22:08.465 --> 22:11.053
And wasn't that
a fabulous concert?

22:11.813 --> 22:13.228
What?

22:13.228 --> 22:14.988
Oh, he's not back yet.

22:14.988 --> 22:18.578
I guess he and Marcus
must be enjoying themselves.

22:19.545 --> 22:21.201
Weezy!
Guess who's back!

22:22.582 --> 22:24.515
Ah, speak of the devil,
and in he walks!

22:24.515 --> 22:26.621
Talk to you later, Helen.
Bye.

22:26.621 --> 22:28.933
Hi, George.

22:28.933 --> 22:30.349
Did you have
a good time?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.005
A good time?
We had a great time!

22:32.005 --> 22:33.835
Just lying out there
under the stars,

22:33.835 --> 22:35.526
listening to the peace
and the quiet.

22:35.526 --> 22:38.115
I wish I could have stayed
another week!

22:38.115 --> 22:41.083
Oh, that's wonderful.

22:41.083 --> 22:43.016
Did Marcus enjoy
himself, too?

22:43.016 --> 22:44.328
Oh, he was kind of
scared at first,

22:44.328 --> 22:47.331
with all them wolves
and mountain lions
hanging around.

22:48.436 --> 22:50.507
Mountain lions?
Yeah!

22:50.507 --> 22:53.717
But they don't bother you.
All you gotta do
is just stare 'em down.

22:56.823 --> 23:00.551
And after Marcus saw
I knew what I was doing,
he wasn't scared no more.

23:00.551 --> 23:03.485
Oh, I'm so proud
of you, George.

23:03.485 --> 23:05.901
I would have been scared.
I know.

23:05.901 --> 23:09.457
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you a little
souvenir from the woods.

23:12.356 --> 23:13.461
Uh...

23:15.255 --> 23:18.017
What's that?
It's a pinecone.

23:18.017 --> 23:20.985
I had to climb a great,
big ol' oak tree
to get you this.

23:23.885 --> 23:25.542
I mean that.

23:25.542 --> 23:27.440
That? That's my foot.

23:28.614 --> 23:30.512
Move it, George.

23:30.512 --> 23:33.032
Weezy, ain't you gonna
look at the pinecone
I brought you?

23:36.415 --> 23:39.832
"The Forest Lodge Motel."
George, what...

23:39.832 --> 23:42.938
Well, Weez, it got
kind of cold out there,
so me and Marcus...

23:42.938 --> 23:45.665
Stayed in a nice,
comfortable motel,
right?

23:45.665 --> 23:47.287
Well, it wasn't that nice.

23:48.357 --> 23:50.221
Is Mama here?
No.

23:50.221 --> 23:51.947
She left already?

23:51.947 --> 23:54.018
No. She never
came over.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.055
Why not?

23:56.055 --> 23:57.263
One of the painters
got sick.

23:57.263 --> 24:00.059
So she's having her
apartment painted next weekend.

24:00.887 --> 24:02.441
Next weekend?

24:04.304 --> 24:07.066
Yes, isn't that nice?

24:07.066 --> 24:10.828
She'll be able to spend
Saturday and Sunday
with you after all!

24:10.828 --> 24:12.140
Me? What about you?

24:12.968 --> 24:15.971
Oh, what a shame,

24:15.971 --> 24:19.630
but I promised Helen
I'd go to the health spa
with her.

24:19.630 --> 24:20.838
But never mind.

24:20.838 --> 24:24.186
You and Mother Jefferson
have a good time together.

24:47.762 --> 24:51.697
LOUISE: The Jeffersonswas
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

25:02.811 --> 25:04.710
Movin',
movin' on up
