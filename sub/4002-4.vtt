10:33.500 --> 10:34.458
[beep]

10:36.625 --> 10:37.875
QUINN HERE YET?

10:37.875 --> 10:39.667
YEAH, I JUST SAW HIM
PULL UP.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.458
JESUS, YOU SHOULD HAVE
BEAT ME HERE DRIVING THIS THING.

10:46.458 --> 10:49.041
I GOT STUCK ON THE CAUSEWAY
BEHIND A STALLED CAR.

10:49.041 --> 10:51.625
I KNOW YOU EARN MORE
WITH A SHIELD, BUT COME ON.

10:51.625 --> 10:54.667
GOT A GREAT LEASE IS ALL.
WHAT DO WE GOT?

10:54.667 --> 10:55.959
JACK RICE, 34.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.542
HIS HEAD'S CAVED IN.

10:57.542 --> 10:59.083
LOOKS LIKE A "B" AND "E"
GONE SIDEWAYS.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.875
A BUNCH OF PRIORS
IN THE AREA.

11:00.875 --> 11:02.125
WITNESSES?

11:02.125 --> 11:03.875
JUST ONE.

11:03.875 --> 11:08.125
JACK TOOK THE DAY OFF
TO SEE A MATINEE WITH ME.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.333
A ROMANTIC COMEDY.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.375
HE CALLS THEM CHICK FLICKS,

11:12.375 --> 11:14.792
BUT HE KNOWS
THEY MAKE ME HAPPY, SO...

11:14.792 --> 11:18.000
I'M SURE
HE WAS A GREAT GUY.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.500
BUT THE MAN YOU SAW FLEEING,

11:19.500 --> 11:21.166
HE WAS ABOUT SIX-FOOT,
YOU SAID?

11:21.166 --> 11:22.834
AND I MET JACK
AT THE COFFEE PLACE

11:22.834 --> 11:23.917
WHERE I WORK.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.834
WHEN HE CAME IN,

11:26.834 --> 11:29.917
SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME
JUST RECOGNIZED HIM,

11:29.917 --> 11:32.417
EVEN THOUGH
WE'D NEVER MET.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.166
HAVE YOU EVER
FELT THAT WAY BEFORE?

11:34.166 --> 11:35.500
TOO MANY TIMES.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.667
WE CAN LOOK
AT SOME MUG SHOTS.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.375
MAYBE DESCRIBE
THE MAN YOU SAW

11:38.375 --> 11:40.000
TO A SKETCH ARTIST.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.208
A WHAT?

11:41.208 --> 11:44.291
I-I'M STAYING WITH JACK.

11:44.291 --> 11:47.000
JACK HAS TO GO
TO THE MORGUE.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.959
FORENSICS IS GONNA
NEED HER CLOTHES.

11:48.959 --> 11:52.583
WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU TELL HER?

11:52.583 --> 11:53.959
YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT.

11:53.959 --> 11:57.208
IT'S HIS FAVORITE CAP.

11:57.208 --> 11:58.792
MA'AM THE CAP NEEDS
TO COME WITH ME.

11:58.792 --> 12:00.834
UH-UH.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.417
SORRY, FIONA.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.083
WE'LL GIVE IT BACK
TO YOU WHEN WE'RE DONE.

12:04.083 --> 12:07.291
YOU WON'T.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.750
HEY, LOOK AT ME.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.542
COME ON, RIGHT HERE.

12:10.542 --> 12:11.875
I'M TELLING YOU

12:11.875 --> 12:15.709
THAT I, JOSEPH QUINN,
WILL PERSONALLY MAKE SURE

12:15.709 --> 12:17.834
THAT HAT COMES BACK TO YOU
UNHARMED.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.959
HE'S GOOD.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.000
WHO KNEW?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.291
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO KEEP OF JACK'S?

12:27.291 --> 12:30.542
MAYBE ONE OF HIS SHIRTS?

12:30.542 --> 12:31.959
COME ON.

12:35.125 --> 12:38.792
HE'S LIKE THE FUCKING
WITNESS WHISPERER.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.542
(Dexter)
MAYBE HE SHOULD PROPOSE
TO RITA FOR ME.

12:49.417 --> 12:52.500
ASTOR, THAT'S SO UNFAIR.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.333
YOU'RE MY LITTLE GIRL,
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.000
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.041
[knocking at door]

12:58.041 --> 12:59.750
(woman)
RITA, YOU IN THERE?

12:59.750 --> 13:01.959
YEAH, JUST ONE SECOND.

13:04.208 --> 13:07.125
ASTOR, I ASKED YOU
A QUESTION.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.750
LOOK, WHETHER DEXTER
AND I GET MARRIED

13:09.750 --> 13:10.959
IS BETWEEN HIM AND ME.

13:10.959 --> 13:13.792
YOU AND I,
WE HAVE TO WORK

13:13.792 --> 13:15.333
ON BEING KINDER
WITH EACH OTHER.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.583
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN HELP ME WITH THAT?

13:17.583 --> 13:18.959
PLEASE?

13:18.959 --> 13:20.125
[pounding on door]

13:20.125 --> 13:22.458
RITA, WE NEED YOU
OUT HERE.

13:22.458 --> 13:24.792
LOOK, I'VE GOTTA
GET BACK TO WORK.

13:24.792 --> 13:27.917
WE'RE GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS TONIGHT, OKAY?

13:27.917 --> 13:28.917
ALL RIGHT.

13:35.959 --> 13:37.458
WE NEED TO SWITCH ROOMS.

13:37.458 --> 13:40.000
WE WERE EXPECTING
TO WATCH THE SUN SET

13:40.000 --> 13:41.333
FROM OUR HONEYMOON SUITE,

13:41.333 --> 13:43.959
BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,
WE'RE ON OUR HONEYMOON.

13:43.959 --> 13:45.166
BUT WE COULDN'T
SEE ANYTHING.

13:45.166 --> 13:47.041
RIGHT, UH...

13:47.041 --> 13:50.125
WELL, THE SUN
SETS IN THE WEST.

13:50.125 --> 13:53.166
AND MIAMI IS ON
THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA,

13:53.166 --> 13:54.417
SO THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING WE CAN--

13:54.417 --> 13:55.709
THE BROCHURE SAID,

13:55.709 --> 13:58.083
"WATCH THE SUN SET
OVER THE OCEAN."

13:58.083 --> 13:59.333
DIDN'T IT, HONEY?

13:59.333 --> 14:00.500
IT MAY HAVE SAID
"SUN RISE."

14:00.500 --> 14:03.083
WE WANT YOUR BEST ROOM.

14:03.083 --> 14:06.041
THE HONEYMOON SUITE
IS OUR BEST ROOM.

14:06.041 --> 14:09.166
THERE'S ALWAYS
A BETTER ROOM.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.834
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.792
PERHAPS I CAN OFFER YOU
A COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST.

14:12.792 --> 14:14.125
I WANT A HIGHER FLOOR,

14:14.125 --> 14:16.458
A BETTER VIEW,
AND BETTER LIGHTING.

14:16.458 --> 14:18.417
IT WAS WAY TOO DARK IN THERE
WITH THE CURTAINS CLOSED.

14:18.417 --> 14:20.875
HOW 'BOUT
A ONE HOUR SPA TREATMENT?

14:20.875 --> 14:21.834
I WANT A BETTER ROOM.

14:21.834 --> 14:23.792
ALL RIGHT,
WE DON'T HAVE A BETTER ROOM

14:23.792 --> 14:25.166
UNLESS YOU BUILD ONE,
AND BEING A BITCH

14:25.166 --> 14:26.625
ISN'T GONNA CHANGE THAT.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.333
RITA.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.041
EXCUSE ME.
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.417
WE CAN'T HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN.

14:37.417 --> 14:38.709
I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

14:38.709 --> 14:40.583
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
THIS WEEK.

14:40.583 --> 14:42.125
PLUS, YOU'RE ALWAYS ON A BREAK
OR CALLING IN SICK.

14:42.125 --> 14:43.709
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,

14:43.709 --> 14:45.542
BUT, HONESTLY,
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.

14:45.542 --> 14:48.625
AND NOW I HAVE TO COMP
THE HONEYMOON SUITE.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.792
I'M REALLY SORRY,
BUT I JUST CAN'T AFFORD

14:50.792 --> 14:52.083
TO EMPLOY YOU ANYMORE.

14:55.250 --> 14:56.834
NOW, HOW CAN WE
MAKE THIS RIGHT?

14:56.834 --> 14:58.625
(Dexter)
SOME PEOPLE
ARE TICKING TIME BOMBS.

14:58.625 --> 15:00.542
RAMON IS ONE OF THEM.

15:00.542 --> 15:03.625
AND MIGUEL NEEDS
TO SEE HIM EXPLODE.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.417
THE INCITER,

15:05.417 --> 15:08.083
THAT'S A ROLE
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD AT.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.083
PICK-UP FOR MORGAN.

15:14.125 --> 15:16.125
RAMON.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

15:16.125 --> 15:18.417
DEXTER.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.417
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
MIGUEL SAID YOU TWO CAME HERE.

15:21.417 --> 15:24.166
IT'S YOUR SECRET SPOT,
RIGHT?

15:24.166 --> 15:26.417
NOT ANYMORE.

15:26.417 --> 15:27.750
OH, DON'T WORRY.

15:27.750 --> 15:30.667
I'LL KEEP IT
BETWEEN THE THREE OF US.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.834
JEFE,  ANOTHER RUM AND COKE.

15:32.834 --> 15:35.709
OH, AND COULD I GET
SOME EXTRA PICKLES?

15:38.750 --> 15:41.250
HEY, SORRY ABOUT THE WAY
ASR TREATED LITTLE CARLOS

15:41.250 --> 15:43.250
YESTERDAY.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.917
OH, RIGHT, YOU LEFT.

15:44.917 --> 15:46.417
IT WAS A MINOR TURF WAR.

15:46.417 --> 15:49.125
DON'T WORRY,
I WATCHED OUT FOR HIM.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.208
CARLOS IS A TOUGH KID.

15:50.208 --> 15:51.750
HE CAN HOLD HIS OWN.

15:51.750 --> 15:52.875
YEAH, I'M SURE.

15:57.166 --> 15:58.917
SURE YOU WANT
TO BE DRINKING THAT?

15:58.917 --> 16:02.333
IF I WASN'T SURE,
I WOULDN'T DRINK IT.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.250
IT'S JUST...

16:04.250 --> 16:06.208
YOU KNOW,
MIGUEL'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

16:06.208 --> 16:09.291
NO OFFENSE, DEXTER,

16:09.291 --> 16:11.959
BUT IF MIGUEL
HAS A PROBLEM WITH ME

16:11.959 --> 16:14.083
HE WILL TELL ME HIMSELF.

16:14.083 --> 16:15.208
RIGHT.

16:15.208 --> 16:19.000
I MEAN,
HE SAID HE DID.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.709
BUT, YEAH, HE WILL AGAIN
IF HE NEEDS TO.

16:20.709 --> 16:22.709
WHAT GOES ON BETWEEN
ME AND MY BROTHER

16:22.709 --> 16:25.792
IS BETWEEN
ME AND MY BROTHER.

16:25.792 --> 16:28.625
ABSOLUTELY.

16:28.625 --> 16:29.834
I JUST HAPPENED
TO BE THERE

16:29.834 --> 16:34.208
WHEN MIGUEL NEEDED
SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

16:34.208 --> 16:36.792
SINCE I'VE
BEEN THROUGH IT TOO.

16:36.792 --> 16:39.333
MY MOTHER WAS KILLED
WHEN I WAS A KID.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.625
I'M SORRY.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.250
SO I KNOW
HOW IT FEELS.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.250
HA.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.208
BUT IT GETS EASIER.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.000
HMM.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.166
LIKE MIGUEL SAID,
WHEN HE ACCEPTED HIS LOSS

16:53.166 --> 16:55.125
AND FOUND CLOSURE,
HE MOVED ON.

16:55.125 --> 16:56.709
HEY!

16:56.709 --> 16:58.250
NOBODY IS ACCEPTING ANYTHING.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.834
OKAY?

16:59.834 --> 17:01.625
AND WHEN YOUR
HOMICIDE DEPARTMENT

17:01.625 --> 17:03.792
GETS OFF ITS ASS AND STARTS
DOING ITS FUCKING JOB,

17:03.792 --> 17:07.834
MAYBE THEN ME AND MY BROTHER
WILL MOVE ON.

17:07.834 --> 17:11.250
EXTRA PICKLES.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.625
THANKS.

17:15.875 --> 17:18.000
I MUST HAVE MISINTERPRETED
WHAT HE SAID.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.750
YEAH.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.208
YOU DID.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.750
WELL, ENJOY YOUR DINNER.

17:26.750 --> 17:29.000
AND TELL CARLOS
I SAID HOWDY.

17:41.417 --> 17:42.792
[knock on door]

17:42.792 --> 17:44.959
I KNEW I'D FIND YOU
STILL HERE.

17:44.959 --> 17:48.500
NO REST FOR THE WICKED.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.750
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO THESE PARTS?

17:50.750 --> 17:55.208
UH, I WANTED TO ASK YOU
ABOUT CHICKY HINES.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.291
AGAIN?

17:56.291 --> 17:58.208
I GOT A WITNESS
WHO CAN PROVIDE

17:58.208 --> 17:59.458
AN ALIBI FOR HINES.

17:59.458 --> 18:00.750
IT CHECKS OUT.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.667
I TOLD YOU
I REVIEWED HIS STATEMENT.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.250
BUT YOU NEVER TALKED TO HIM.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.917
OH, COME ON, MARIA.

18:05.917 --> 18:08.208
YOUR WITNESS
IS A HABITUAL CRIMINAL

18:08.208 --> 18:10.709
WHO'S JUST TRYING TO BEAT
HIS LATEST DRUG RAP.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.625
YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT ISN'T TRUE.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.333
AND HE CAN CLEAR HINES.

18:14.333 --> 18:17.000
HAVE YOU EVEN MET
CHICKY HINES?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.333
I MEAN HAVE--

18:18.333 --> 18:20.125
HAVE YOU READ HIS JACKET?

18:20.125 --> 18:21.291
BECAUSE IT'S--

18:21.291 --> 18:22.959
HINES DIDN'T DO
THIS CRIME.

18:22.959 --> 18:24.542
OKAY.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.333
WHAT'S THIS REALLY ABOUT?

18:31.333 --> 18:33.166
AN INNOCENT MAN
BEHIND BARS.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.291
MAYBE.

18:34.291 --> 18:38.083
MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE AT PLAY.

18:38.083 --> 18:40.417
ACCEPTING THE TRUTH
ABOUT JAMES DOAKES,

18:40.417 --> 18:42.166
THAT WAS HARD
FOR ALL OF US.

18:42.166 --> 18:45.750
WOW.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.625
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT.

18:47.625 --> 18:48.792
I KNOW.

18:48.792 --> 18:50.375
LOOK, I SHOULDN'T EVEN
HAVE MENTIONED IT.

18:50.375 --> 18:53.000
BUT, COME ON,
HE WAS YOUR PARTNER.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.333
HE'S YOUR FRIEND.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.917
MAYBE YOU THINK

18:56.917 --> 19:00.375
HE WAS RAILROADED,
I DON'T KNOW.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.750
AND MAYBE THAT'S COLORING
HOW YOU'RE SEEING HINES.

19:02.750 --> 19:06.959
I'LL ADMIT
IT WAS HARD.

19:06.959 --> 19:09.083
BUT YOU KNOW ME,
YOU KNOW I'M A PRO.

19:09.083 --> 19:13.083
I ALSO KNOW YOU'RE HUMAN
LIKE THE REST OF US.

19:16.291 --> 19:19.333
I'M JUST PUTTING THAT OUT THERE
BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.166
THE FIANCEE'S WORKING
WITH A SKETCH ARTIST NOW.

19:29.166 --> 19:30.917
SO FAR IT MATCHES
WHAT THE BURGLARY DIVISION

19:30.917 --> 19:32.834
ALREADY HAS
ON THE BREAK-INS,

19:32.834 --> 19:35.333
SO SHE'S NOT GIVING US ANYTHING
WE DON'T ALREADY HAVE.

19:35.333 --> 19:36.834
YEAH, EXCEPT FOR MORE STORIES
ABOUT HOW PERFECT

19:36.834 --> 19:39.000
HER DEAD FIANCE WAS.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.709
HEY, IT'S NOT EASY REALIZING
YOU'RE ALONE IN THE WORLD.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.417
WHAT'S THE BLOOD SPLATTER
TELLING YOU?

19:46.417 --> 19:49.417
[cell phone vibrates]

19:49.417 --> 19:51.417
JUST CLARIFYING
SOME DISCREPANCIES.

19:51.417 --> 19:52.625
WELL, CLARIFY FAST.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.917
HEY, I'M GONNA
WRAP THIS THING UP,

19:53.917 --> 19:55.083
GET YOU TWO GUYS BACK
ON THE SKINNER CASE.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.834
YEAH, YOU'RE PREACHING
TO THE CHOIR, SIR.

19:57.834 --> 19:58.959
MORGAN, YOUR ASS IS--

19:58.959 --> 20:00.542
THANK YOU.
I FUCKING NOTICED IT.

20:00.542 --> 20:01.792
TA-DA!

20:01.792 --> 20:03.291
COMP TICKETS
TO MY KEYNOTE ADDRESS

20:03.291 --> 20:04.667
AT THE FORENSICS CONFERENCE.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.583
NOT REALLY MY THING.

20:06.583 --> 20:08.417
I'M FLEA-COMBING
MY DOG THAT NIGHT.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.041
I'M SEEING
MY LITTLE GIRL THAT NIGHT.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.250
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
THE DATE.

20:13.333 --> 20:15.417
I GOTTA KEEP MY SCHEDULE
OPEN FOR HER.

20:19.792 --> 20:21.709
ET TU,  DEX-TAY?

20:21.709 --> 20:23.667
WOULDN'T MISS IT.

20:29.333 --> 20:30.709
MASUKA.

20:30.709 --> 20:32.709
HE'S CHOSEN THE ROLE
OF COURT JESTER.

20:32.709 --> 20:35.417
NOW WE ONLY LIKE HIM
WHEN HE'S MAKING US LAUGH.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.041
STILL, THERE'S SOMETHING
TO BE SAID

20:37.041 --> 20:38.792
FOR BEING
A CHARACTER ACTOR.

20:38.792 --> 20:40.750
THE LEAD PLAYERS
WITH ALL THOSE EMOTIONS,

20:40.750 --> 20:44.250
MUST BE EXHAUSTING.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.375
LOOKS LIKE THE SKETCH
THAT BURGLARY ALREADY HAS

20:51.375 --> 20:52.583
ON THE BREAK-IN SUSPECT.

20:52.583 --> 20:54.583
YOU COULDN'T GET
ANY MORE OUT OF HER?

20:54.583 --> 20:56.250
OFFICER MORGAN,
THE WOMAN'S A WRECK.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.917
SO...HE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY DISTINGUISHING MARKS,

21:04.917 --> 21:06.583
ANY SCARS
OR TATTOOS?

21:06.583 --> 21:08.917
UH, MAYBE.

21:08.917 --> 21:11.250
UM, I DON'T REMEMBER.

21:11.250 --> 21:12.750
HE RAN RIGHT BY YOU.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.667
I WAS SURPRISED.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.417
LET'S TAKE
A DEEP BREATH.

21:17.417 --> 21:20.667
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

21:20.667 --> 21:23.834
TRY TO PICTURE IT AGAIN.

21:23.834 --> 21:27.041
IT'S SO HORRIBLE.

21:27.041 --> 21:29.208
MY JACK JUST LYING THERE.

21:29.208 --> 21:30.542
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

21:30.542 --> 21:32.542
OKAY, LET'S NOT PICTURE IT
ANYMORE.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.041
JACK'S NEVER COMING BACK.

21:34.041 --> 21:36.542
LET'S FOCUS ON SOMETHING ELSE
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

21:36.542 --> 21:38.542
WE'LL JUST FOCUS
ON SOMETHING ELSE.

21:38.542 --> 21:41.959
FIONA.
HI.

21:41.959 --> 21:43.000
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.625
I'M NOT HELPING AT ALL.

21:44.625 --> 21:47.542
WHO YOU KIDDING?
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

21:47.542 --> 21:48.875
YOU'RE A CHAMP.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.917
I'M TRYING, BUT--

21:53.333 --> 21:55.291
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK
FROM ALL THIS

21:55.291 --> 21:57.542
AND WE'LL GO LOOK AT SOME
PICTURES TOGETHER, OKAY?

21:57.542 --> 21:59.500
OKAY.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.667
WE'LL BE IN INTERVIEW THREE
WITH THE MUG BOOKS.

22:01.667 --> 22:03.375
I'LL SET IT UP.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.291
THAT'S OKAY,
I GOT IT.

22:24.667 --> 22:26.333
THEY SAY THIS PART
SHOULD PASS SOON.

22:28.417 --> 22:30.583
THEY SAY I SHOULD GLOW.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.750
AM I GLOWING?

22:32.750 --> 22:35.166
YOU ARE TO ME.

22:40.917 --> 22:43.834
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I CALLED A GUEST A BITCH.

22:43.834 --> 22:45.667
SOUNDED LIKE
AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION.

22:45.667 --> 22:48.583
I THINK I'M GONNA
TALK TO MY BOSS

22:48.583 --> 22:50.125
AND ASK FOR MY JOB BACK.

22:50.125 --> 22:51.542
REALLY? I ALWAYS GOT
THE IMPRESSION

22:51.542 --> 22:53.208
YOU DIDN'T PARTICULARLY
LIKE THAT JOB.

22:53.208 --> 22:54.458
IT'S A JOB.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.041
NO ONE'S GONNA HIRE ME
KNOWING I HAVE TO GO

22:57.041 --> 22:58.208
ON MATERNITY LEAVE.

22:58.208 --> 23:01.208
PLUS I BARELY HAVE
ANY SAVINGS.

23:01.208 --> 23:02.583
I'M PREGNANT.

23:02.583 --> 23:04.041
NO HEALTH INSURANCE.

23:04.041 --> 23:06.500
MY INSURANCE
WOULD COVER YOU.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.667
RITA, IF WE GOT MARRIED
WE'D HAVE JOINT ASSETS.

23:08.667 --> 23:10.625
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY.

23:10.625 --> 23:12.250
AND LET'S NOT FORGET
ABOUT MARITAL DEDUCTIONS.

23:12.250 --> 23:15.375
WITH ASTOR AND CODY
AS DEPENDANTS--

23:15.375 --> 23:16.583
[retches]

23:22.041 --> 23:23.834
NO, HUH?
UH-UH.

23:31.917 --> 23:34.750
THAT'S ONE UGLY GUITAR.

23:34.750 --> 23:36.875
UGLY?
PSSH.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.709
A BEAT-UP GUITAR
LIKE THIS

23:38.709 --> 23:40.959
SPEAKS TO THE EXPERIENCE
OF ITS OWNER.

23:40.959 --> 23:43.208
THE MANY HARD ROADS
WE'VE TRAVELED TOGETHER.

23:43.208 --> 23:45.083
SO YOU'VE HAD IT
A LONG TIME.

23:45.083 --> 23:46.375
NO, A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

23:46.375 --> 23:49.417
PICKED IT UP AT A PAWN SHOP
FOR 20 BUCKS.

23:49.417 --> 23:51.417
GIVES ME A CERTAIN MYSTIQUE,
DOESN'T IT?

23:51.417 --> 23:54.625
YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT.

23:54.625 --> 23:56.417
SO WHAT DO YOU NEED,
OFFICER?

23:56.417 --> 23:59.959
A STIFF DRINK
AFTER A SHIT DAY.

23:59.959 --> 24:01.208
AND YOU CAME HERE?

24:01.208 --> 24:02.834
FOR THE MARGARITAS,
TRUST ME.

24:02.834 --> 24:05.375
ONE MARGARITA.

24:08.750 --> 24:10.625
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW QUINN?

24:10.625 --> 24:12.667
HE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH YOUR DAY BEING SHIT?

24:12.667 --> 24:14.250
MAYBE.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.208
I'VE HEARD
STUFF ABOUT HIM.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.667
AND HE COMES OFF
REALLY SLICK,

24:17.667 --> 24:20.083
AND THEN HE TURNS AROUND
AND HE'S ALL SENSITIVE

24:20.083 --> 24:22.250
AND CARING ABOUT PEOPLE.

24:22.250 --> 24:25.125
WHAT'S HIS STORY,
IS HE A GOOD GUY OR A BAD GUY?

24:25.125 --> 24:26.792
DOES IT HAVE TO BE
EITHER/OR?

24:26.792 --> 24:29.125
IN MY WORLD, YEAH.

24:29.125 --> 24:30.917
BUT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHICH ONE HE DECIDED ON.

24:30.917 --> 24:34.500
ALL I KNOW IS, UM,

24:34.500 --> 24:37.458
QUINN HELPED ME OUT OF A JAM
WHEN I WAS IN TROUBLE.

24:39.458 --> 24:42.667
THE MAN GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY,
AND I TOOK IT.

24:44.834 --> 24:46.125
OKAY.

24:46.125 --> 24:48.792
BESIDES, WITHOUT QUINN,

24:48.792 --> 24:51.709
YOU WOULD HAVE NO C.I.,

24:51.709 --> 24:53.250
AND I'D BE DRINKING ALONE.

24:56.458 --> 24:58.875
I DOUBT THAT.

24:58.875 --> 25:01.917
[both laugh]

25:06.166 --> 25:08.625
[keys rattling in lock]

25:21.750 --> 25:24.834
OH, YOU'RE A HUNGRY MAN.

25:24.834 --> 25:26.792
AND YOU'RE
A BEAUTIFUL MEAL.

25:26.792 --> 25:30.291
YOU, UH, YOU LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING SPECIAL TONIGHT?

25:30.291 --> 25:32.709
YOUR EYES.

25:32.709 --> 25:33.834
THEY'RE SOULFUL.

25:33.834 --> 25:35.875
WELL, THE COMPLIMENTS
ARE FREE.

25:35.875 --> 25:40.291
BUT AN HOUR OF MY TIME COSTS.

25:40.291 --> 25:43.542
IT MIGHT BE MORE
THAN AN HOUR.

25:46.792 --> 25:49.083
TAKE A PASS,
SERGEANT.

25:52.125 --> 25:54.875
TONIGHT, FOR A COUPLE
OF HOURS ANYWAY,

25:54.875 --> 25:57.166
I'M NOT A--

25:57.166 --> 26:01.750
TONIGHT, ALL NIGHT,
I AM.

26:04.959 --> 26:07.250
SHIT, THIS IS A STING.

26:09.417 --> 26:11.250
JUST SHUT UP
AND GO WITH THIS.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.667
YOU GOD DAMN DEADBEAT.

26:12.667 --> 26:15.208
YOU COME UP TO MY ROOM
AND YOU AIN'T GOT NO CASH!

26:15.208 --> 26:17.041
WELL, NOBODY SEES JAZMIN

26:17.041 --> 26:18.959
THAT AIN'T GOT NO CASH.

26:18.959 --> 26:21.500
YOU WASTED MY TIME,
YOU MOTHERFUCKER.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.834
(Miguel)
WOW, SO SHE THREW UP?

26:27.834 --> 26:29.625
YEP.

26:29.625 --> 26:31.208
HER ANSWER APPARENTLY.

26:31.208 --> 26:33.291
NOT REALLY THE RESPONSE
YOU WANT TO HEAR

26:33.291 --> 26:34.834
TO A MARRIAGE PROPOSAL.

26:34.834 --> 26:36.834
YEAH, HENCE MY CALL TO YOU.

26:36.834 --> 26:39.250
AND THE BRIBE
OF A BEER.

26:39.250 --> 26:42.000
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY HAD
ONE SUCCESSFUL PROPOSAL.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.041
TELL ME YOUR SECRET,
OH WISE ONE.

26:47.291 --> 26:48.834
WELL, WHATEVER YOU DO,

26:48.834 --> 26:50.834
DON'T SUGGEST ELOPING
BECAUSE A WEDDING CONFLICTS

26:50.834 --> 26:52.625
WITH A BIG CASE
YOU'VE GOT COMING UP.

26:52.625 --> 26:54.625
YOU DID THAT?

26:54.625 --> 26:56.792
IT WENT OVER ABOUT AS WELL
AS YOURS DID.

26:56.792 --> 26:58.166
I'M NOT THE ONLY
HOPELESS ONE.

26:58.166 --> 26:59.834
YOU AND ME, BUDDY,

26:59.834 --> 27:02.792
MAKING THE WOMEN
OF AMERICA SICK.

27:04.834 --> 27:06.166
I DID EVENTUALLY
FIGURE OUT

27:06.166 --> 27:08.166
THAT WOMEN TEND TO LEAD
WITH THEIR HEARTS.

27:08.166 --> 27:10.875
SO YOU MIGHT TRY
LEADING WITH YOURS.

27:10.875 --> 27:12.875
IS THAT THE ONLY OPTION?

27:12.875 --> 27:14.291
ONLY ONE THAT WORKS,
HERMANO.

27:16.625 --> 27:17.959
OH, SPEAKING OF HERMANOS,

27:17.959 --> 27:19.500
I RAN INTO RAMON
LAST NIGHT.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.709
I HEARD.

27:20.709 --> 27:22.125
ACTUALLY, I GOT AN EARFUL.

27:22.125 --> 27:23.625
SORRY.

27:23.625 --> 27:25.875
I TRIED TO REACH OUT TO HIM,
MAKE A CONNECTION.

27:25.875 --> 27:27.083
I THINK I JUST
UPSET HIM MORE.

27:27.083 --> 27:28.375
IT'S OKAY.

27:28.375 --> 27:30.291
IT LED TO
A REALLY GOOD TALK.

27:32.625 --> 27:34.000
TALK?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.959
I DIDN'T TELL HIM, DEXTER.

27:35.959 --> 27:38.583
I KEEP MY PROMISES.

27:38.583 --> 27:41.959
BUT WHEN AND IF YOU EVER
FEEL COMFORTABLE TELLING HIM,

27:41.959 --> 27:45.000
I'M JUST SAYING
I THINK RAMON'S READY.

27:49.875 --> 27:51.959
MIGUEL KEEPS TRYING
TO CAST RAMON

27:51.959 --> 27:54.291
IN THE ROLE
OF MISUNDERSTOOD GOOD GUY.

27:54.291 --> 27:56.917
PERSONALLY, I THINK HE MAKES
A MUCH BETTER BAD GUY.

27:56.917 --> 27:58.458
I JUST HAVE
TO CONVINCE MIGUEL.

27:58.458 --> 28:01.875
A DONUT AND A TICKET
TO HEAR ME SPEAK?

28:01.875 --> 28:03.875
I'LL TAKE A DONUT.

28:07.458 --> 28:08.875
YOU ALREADY GOT A TICKET.

28:08.875 --> 28:10.834
YOU'RE BRIBING PEOPLE TO COME
TO YOUR KEYNOTE ADDRESS?

28:10.834 --> 28:12.917
THE WHOLE DONUT THING
WORKS FOR YOU, DOESN'T IT?

28:12.917 --> 28:15.166
THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND.

28:15.166 --> 28:17.458
DONUT AND A TICKET?

28:20.417 --> 28:23.000
JUST FUCKING TAKE ONE.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
HEY.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.542
HEY.
SOMETHING UP, LEW?

28:27.542 --> 28:29.333
YOU REMEMBER
THAT STATEMENT YOU TOOK

28:29.333 --> 28:30.625
FROM THE CHICKY HINES ALIBI?

28:30.625 --> 28:32.959
YOU WANT ME
TO RECITE IT BY HEART?

28:32.959 --> 28:35.333
SO YOU BUY IT?

28:35.333 --> 28:37.166
EVEN THOUGH THE ALIBI
COMES FROM SOMEBODY

28:37.166 --> 28:38.500
TRYING TO BEAT A DRUG RAP?

28:38.500 --> 28:40.083
IT'S SOLID.

28:40.083 --> 28:41.709
[sighs]

28:41.709 --> 28:44.125
IS THE A.D.A.
STILL SITTING ON IT.

28:44.125 --> 28:45.500
MM-HMM.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.834
WELL, THEN YOU DID
ALL YOU COULD.

28:49.959 --> 28:51.166
MAYBE.

28:54.417 --> 28:55.750
HELL MUSTA FROZE OVER

28:55.750 --> 28:58.542
'CAUSE COPS WON'T EAT
DONUTS ANYMORE.

28:58.542 --> 29:00.208
WELL, MAYBE THE PRICE
IS A LITTLE TOO HIGH.

29:00.208 --> 29:01.583
OH, PLEASE.

29:01.583 --> 29:03.208
WELL, WHY WOULDN'T THEY
WANT TO SUPPORT

29:03.208 --> 29:05.041
A VALUABLE COLLEAGUE
DURING HIS SHINING MOMENT?

29:05.041 --> 29:07.542
YOU WANT AN HONEST ANSWER
TO THAT?

29:07.542 --> 29:08.750
IT WAS RHETORICAL.

29:10.375 --> 29:12.250
ALL RIGHT.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.917
ALL RIGHT, TELL ME.

29:14.917 --> 29:18.500
YOU'RE, LIKE, THE FOULEST
PERSON I'VE EVER MET.

29:18.500 --> 29:21.000
EVERY LINE
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH

29:21.000 --> 29:22.542
IS A SICK JOKE.

29:22.542 --> 29:23.875
I'M FUNNY.

29:23.875 --> 29:25.834
YEAH, YOU CAN BE.

29:25.834 --> 29:29.000
YOU CAN ALSO BE
COMPLETELY REVOLTING.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.667
AND SOMETIMES
THAT'S ALL PEOPLE SEE.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.000
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

29:32.000 --> 29:34.125
YOU'RE THE FUCKING NEW GUY.

29:34.125 --> 29:35.667
HEY, DR. PHIL, YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S
COMING IN AGAIN

29:35.667 --> 29:37.458
TO LOOK AT
MORE MUG BOOKS, SO...

29:40.083 --> 29:41.125
HI THERE, DEB.

29:41.125 --> 29:42.250
HELP YOURSELF.

29:42.250 --> 29:44.959
I SAVED YOU ONE
WITH THE CREAM FILLING.

29:44.959 --> 29:46.583
UGH, FREAK.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.000
SERGEANT BATISTA.

29:56.208 --> 29:58.041
IT'S YOU.

29:58.041 --> 30:00.250
WITH CLOTHES.
I MEAN, DIFFERENT CLOTHES.

30:00.250 --> 30:03.375
YEAH, I'M DETECTIVE
BARBARA GIANNA, METRO VICE.

30:03.375 --> 30:04.750
CAN WE TALK?

30:06.792 --> 30:08.583
YEAH.

30:11.250 --> 30:15.375
LOOK, THIS DEPARTMENT
HAS HAD A LOT OF SHIT

30:15.375 --> 30:17.500
DUMPED ON IT
WITH THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.

30:17.500 --> 30:21.000
AND NOW YOU, A SERGEANT,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.041
ARE LOOKING TO MAKE THE NEWS
GETTING BUSTED WITH HOOKERS.

30:23.041 --> 30:24.625
NOW, I TURN YOU IN NOW,

30:24.625 --> 30:26.792
I SAVE THIS DEPARTMENT
WORSE LATER.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.291
'CAUSE GUYS LIKE YOU
NEVER LEARN.

30:29.291 --> 30:31.166
HEY, LOOK,
MAYBE I'M AN ASSHOLE, BUT--

30:31.166 --> 30:33.000
DO NOT...

30:33.000 --> 30:35.875
INSULT ME BY SAYING
THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME.

30:35.875 --> 30:38.208
OKAY, 'CAUSE I HEAR
THIS SAME HORSESHIT SOB STORY

30:38.208 --> 30:40.000
FROM EVERY JOHN I BUST.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.083
DOES ANY PART OF YOU

30:41.083 --> 30:42.625
THINK THAT ANY PART OF ME

30:42.625 --> 30:44.083
IS PROUD OF WHAT I'VE DONE?

30:44.083 --> 30:47.417
NO PART OF ME REALLY CARES.

30:47.417 --> 30:50.083
IT'S JUST THAT...

30:50.083 --> 30:52.875
I DESTROYED MY MARRIAGE.

30:55.458 --> 30:57.667
I LOST MY LITTLE GIRL.

31:00.667 --> 31:03.500
I'M A DIVORCED COP

31:03.500 --> 31:05.834
HALFWAY DOWN THE ROAD
TO A FULL-BLOWN CLICHE:

31:08.333 --> 31:12.709
A DIVORCED, ALCOHOLIC COP.

31:12.709 --> 31:15.041
AND I NEEDED TO FIGHT THAT...

31:18.792 --> 31:19.875
LONELINESS.

31:22.750 --> 31:26.125
SO I FOUND AFFECTION
ANY WAY I COULD.

31:26.125 --> 31:27.709
I MEAN, HOOKERS?

31:27.709 --> 31:30.208
I NEEDED TO CONNECT
WITH SOMEONE,

31:30.208 --> 31:31.834
ANYONE,

31:31.834 --> 31:34.000
WHO WOULDN'T
HURT ME BACK NO MORE.

31:38.375 --> 31:41.041
THAT'S IT.

31:41.041 --> 31:43.083
NOT SPECIAL.

31:45.083 --> 31:46.542
JUST TRUE.

31:49.875 --> 31:53.125
I HATE ANYONE
WHO DISGRACES THE BADGE.

31:53.125 --> 31:55.709
I HATE LIARS WORSE.

31:55.709 --> 31:57.542
I'M NOT LYING.

31:59.208 --> 32:01.500
I KNOW.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.834
ARE WE GOOD?

32:03.834 --> 32:05.917
YOU KEEP YOUR DICK
IN YOUR PANTS

32:05.917 --> 32:08.792
UNLESS YOU'RE,
"A," PLAYING WITH YOURSELF

32:08.792 --> 32:12.417
OR, "B," YOU ARE DOING
SOMETHING CONSENSUAL AND LEGAL.

32:12.417 --> 32:15.125
THEN WE'RE GOOD.

32:26.583 --> 32:27.917
RAMON, WHAT ARE YOU--

32:27.917 --> 32:30.208
ANY PROGRESS ON FINDING
OSCAR'S KILLER?

32:30.208 --> 32:32.166
WE'RE LIAISING
WITH THE FEDS

32:32.166 --> 32:33.583
IN CASE HE WENT
OVER THE BORDER.

32:33.583 --> 32:35.458
BUT WHAT IF HE'S RIGHT HERE
IN OUR OWN BACKYARD?

32:35.458 --> 32:37.542
IT'S AN ONGOING CONCERN,
RAMON.

32:37.542 --> 32:39.458
BUT NOT A PRIORITY,
RIGHT?

32:39.458 --> 32:40.500
HEY.
LOWER YOUR VOICE.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.834
IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?

32:41.834 --> 32:43.208
YEAH, SERGEANT,

32:43.208 --> 32:45.041
YOUR PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING.

32:45.041 --> 32:46.458
HEY, THAT CREDIT YOU GET
FOR BEING A COP,

32:46.458 --> 32:47.625
IT HAS A LIMIT.

32:47.625 --> 32:49.417
SO YOU DO
HAVE A GAME PLAN.

32:49.417 --> 32:50.792
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO INVOLVE LISTENING

32:50.792 --> 32:51.792
TO SOLID LEADS.

32:51.792 --> 32:54.166
EVERY LEAD
HAS BEEN FOLLOWED.

32:54.166 --> 32:56.375
THEN WHY AM I GETTING CALLS
FROM A GUY

32:56.375 --> 32:57.959
WHO SAYS HE SAW FREEBO
IN MIAMI?

32:57.959 --> 33:00.291
I'LL TELL YOU WHY,
BECAUSE YOU IGNORED HIM.

33:00.291 --> 33:01.625
HE CALLED YOU FOUR TIMES.

33:01.625 --> 33:02.583
NEVER HAPPENED.
OKAY.

33:02.583 --> 33:03.917
[speaking Spanish]

33:03.917 --> 33:06.125
RAMON, YOU GIVE ME
THIS TIPSTER'S NAME,

33:06.125 --> 33:07.959
I WILL PERSONALLY
FOLLOW THROUGH.

33:07.959 --> 33:09.291
THE MOTHERFUCKER
WAS ANONYMOUS, MARIA.

33:09.291 --> 33:11.291
OH, DID I FORGET
TO LEAVE MY NAME?

33:11.291 --> 33:12.583
SORRY.

33:12.583 --> 33:14.333
BUT HE KNEW THINGS
ABOUT THIS CASE.

33:14.333 --> 33:16.375
LIKE FREEBO HAD
A GIRLFRIEND, TEEGAN.

33:16.375 --> 33:17.917
A LOT OF PEOPLE
KNOW THAT, SIR.

33:17.917 --> 33:19.750
I PASSED HER PHOTO
ALL OVER TOWN.

33:19.750 --> 33:21.917
MAYBE THE TIPSTER
WANTED REWARD MONEY.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.834
YOU CAN FIND EXCUSES,
OR YOU CAN GET OFF YOUR ASSES

33:24.834 --> 33:26.458
AND TRY FINDING
MY BROTHER'S KILLER.

33:26.458 --> 33:29.458
OKAY, RAMON,
YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW!

33:39.083 --> 33:41.959
JUST DO YOUR FUCKING JOB.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
YOU WANNA GIVE HIS BROTHER
THE HEADS-UP?

33:53.000 --> 33:54.875
YOU DO IT.

33:54.875 --> 33:58.375
I'M A LITTLE TIRED
OF THE PRADO FAMILY RIGHT NOW.

33:58.375 --> 34:01.291
[sighs]

34:01.291 --> 34:04.542
THAT WAS EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

34:09.250 --> 34:11.875
MIGUEL WON'T BE HAPPY TO HEAR
RAMON'S THROWING TANTRUMS

34:11.875 --> 34:13.875
WITH FELLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT.

34:15.834 --> 34:17.583
NOT THAT I'LL RELY
ON THAT ALONE.

34:17.583 --> 34:20.333
THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH.

34:20.333 --> 34:22.291
AND I'M ON A ROLL.

34:22.291 --> 34:25.083
MAYBE I SHOULD CALL RITA
WITH AN ANONYMOUS TIP

34:25.083 --> 34:27.750
TO MARRY ME.

34:27.750 --> 34:29.875
OH, WHAT THE FUCK, DEX?

34:29.875 --> 34:31.291
GOOD, YOU'RE HERE.

34:31.291 --> 34:33.250
PUT THIS ON.

34:33.250 --> 34:34.542
I DON'T NEED
A GIANT CONDOM.

34:34.542 --> 34:36.291
I NEED YOUR SPATTER REPORT
ON JACK RICE.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.375
I'M WORKING ON IT.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.291
JUST PUT ON THE SUIT
AND THE GLOVES

34:39.291 --> 34:41.291
AND THE MASK, PLEASE.

34:41.291 --> 34:43.041
FINE.

34:43.041 --> 34:45.166
THE SOONER I'M DONE
WITH THE WEEPING FIANCEE,

34:45.166 --> 34:47.083
THE BETTER OFF I'LL BE.

34:47.083 --> 34:49.250
RAW EMOTION.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.625
NOT YOUR FORTE, HUH?

34:50.625 --> 34:52.333
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

34:52.333 --> 34:54.583
HEY, IT'S NOT MINE EITHER.

34:54.583 --> 34:57.291
IT'S EASY AS HELL
FOR QUINN.

34:57.291 --> 35:00.125
THINK HE'S JUST
NICER THAN ME?

35:00.125 --> 35:02.375
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT NICER.

35:02.375 --> 35:05.667
ALTHOUGH STUDIES SHOW
THAT EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE

35:05.667 --> 35:08.709
PLAYS A GREATER ROLE
IN INDIVIDUAL SUCCESS

35:08.709 --> 35:10.333
THAN ANYTHING
THAT CAN BE MEASURED

35:10.333 --> 35:12.458
ON A STANDARD I.Q. TEST.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.291
COME HERE.

35:14.291 --> 35:16.834
STAND RIGHT HERE
AND BASH THIS FOR ME,

35:16.834 --> 35:18.291
WILL YA?

35:18.291 --> 35:20.083
ARE YOU CALLING ME
AN EMOTIONAL IDIOT?

35:20.083 --> 35:21.834
IF YOU'RE AN IDIOT,
I'M A VEGETABLE.

35:21.834 --> 35:24.083
WELL, THAT'S FOR FUCKING SURE.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.000
FUCKIN'-A, DEX!

35:29.000 --> 35:30.417
[chuckles]

35:30.417 --> 35:31.667
SORRY.

35:35.625 --> 35:37.792
YOU KNOW WHAT,
FIONA HAS HER FACTS WRONG.

35:37.792 --> 35:39.375
SHE DESCRIBED THE ASSAILANT

35:39.375 --> 35:41.875
AS SIX-FOOT.

35:41.875 --> 35:43.917
BUT CALCULATING
JACK RICE'S HEIGHT,

35:43.917 --> 35:45.458
ALLOWING FOR
THE UPWARD ANGLE--

35:45.458 --> 35:47.125
LAYMAN HERE.

35:47.125 --> 35:49.125
WELL, YOUR BODY
ACTS AS A SHIELD.

35:49.125 --> 35:53.917
AND ALL OF THIS IS WHAT
YOUR BODY DOESN'T BLOCK.

35:53.917 --> 35:55.625
SO THE KILLER STUNS
THE VICTIM WITH THE FIRST BLOW.

35:55.625 --> 35:57.250
HE FALLS TO HIS KNEES.

35:57.250 --> 36:00.333
THE SECOND BLOW
BRINGS US BLOOD.

36:00.333 --> 36:02.375
IF THE KILLER
WAS SIX-FOOT,

36:02.375 --> 36:04.375
THE SPATTER SHADOW
AT THE CRIME SCENE

36:04.375 --> 36:06.625
WOULD BE TALLER
AND WIDER.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.542
INSTEAD,
IT'S AN EXACT MATCH

36:08.542 --> 36:10.417
FOR YOUR SHADOW.

36:10.417 --> 36:12.250
ERGO, RICE'S KILLER
WAS APPROXIMATELY

36:12.250 --> 36:13.417
YOUR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT.

36:13.417 --> 36:16.458
YOU MEAN FUCKING WEEP-BAG
FIONA'S HEIGHT AND WEIGHT?

36:16.458 --> 36:17.709
NO, I MEAN--

36:20.875 --> 36:24.166
I MISSED THAT.
INTERESTING.

36:36.917 --> 36:39.417
YOU AND JACK
PLANNING A BIG WEDDING?

36:39.417 --> 36:41.000
YEAH.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.166
JACK HAD A LOT
OF FRIENDS, YEAH.

36:43.166 --> 36:45.041
YOU KNOW,

36:45.041 --> 36:47.083
THE THING IS, I WENT THROUGH
HIS ADDRESS BOOK

36:47.083 --> 36:50.166
AND I CALLED
A LOT OF PEOPLE,

36:50.166 --> 36:53.250
AND NONE OF THEM
HAVE EVER HEARD OF YOU.

36:53.250 --> 36:56.166
WELL, WE LIKE TO KEEP
TO OURSELVES, YOU KNOW?

37:01.875 --> 37:03.417
WHEN WAS THAT TAKEN?

37:06.417 --> 37:08.041
IT WAS RIGHT AFTER WE MET.

37:08.041 --> 37:11.166
DID HE GET A CHANCE TO SEE IT
BEFORE YOU KILLED HIM?

37:13.291 --> 37:15.959
WHAT?

37:15.959 --> 37:17.917
UH, WH-WHAT IS SHE
TALKING ABOUT?

37:17.917 --> 37:19.291
I DON'T--

37:19.291 --> 37:22.583
IT'S PHOTO-SHOPPED, FIONA.

37:22.583 --> 37:24.667
IT'S REALLY GOOD WORK, THOUGH.

37:24.667 --> 37:27.000
REALLY GOOD.
DID YOU DO IT YOURSELF?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.375
GOD, NO.

37:28.375 --> 37:30.542
SEE, I'M THINKING MAYBE
YOU BROKE INTO HIS APARTMENT

37:30.542 --> 37:31.834
TO LEAVE THAT
AS A SURPRISE.

37:31.834 --> 37:33.500
HE COMES HOME,
TRIES TO THROW YOUR ASS OUT,

37:33.500 --> 37:34.458
AND YOU KILL HIM.

37:34.458 --> 37:36.417
NO, I WOULD NEVER
HURT JACK.

37:36.417 --> 37:37.417
WE WERE GETTING MARRIED.

37:37.417 --> 37:38.875
YOU HEARD ABOUT
THE BREAK-IN ON TV,

37:38.875 --> 37:41.875
THEN YOU CREATE THE SAME SKETCH
THAT THEY SHOW ON TV,

37:41.875 --> 37:43.208
THE SAME CROWBAR
IN THE BACK DOOR.

37:43.208 --> 37:44.834
YOU BASH YOUR OWN
FUCKING KNEE IN!

37:44.834 --> 37:46.250
DID HE EVER EVEN
TALK TO YOU, FIONA?

37:46.250 --> 37:48.333
DID HE EVER
EVEN SAY MORE THAN

37:48.333 --> 37:50.041
"ONE FUCKING
COFFEE TO GO"?!

37:50.041 --> 37:51.458
THAT'S IT.

37:51.458 --> 37:54.542
THIS IS OVER.

37:54.542 --> 37:56.458
[sniffles]

37:56.458 --> 37:58.875
I'M SORRY?

37:58.875 --> 38:00.291
WAIT OUTSIDE, OFFICER.

38:00.291 --> 38:02.417
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.208
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

38:15.208 --> 38:17.625
UH-UH.

38:17.625 --> 38:18.917
I KNOW

38:18.917 --> 38:21.917
HOW IT REALLY WAS

38:21.917 --> 38:23.542
BETWEEN YOU AND JACK.

38:23.542 --> 38:25.250
I KNOW.

38:25.250 --> 38:28.125
YOU ALL RIGHT?

38:28.125 --> 38:29.750
YEAH.

38:29.750 --> 38:31.333
IT'S SAFE.
IT'S JUST ME AND YOU.

38:35.417 --> 38:37.333
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS SHIT?

38:37.333 --> 38:39.500
IT'S AMAZING.
SHE'S SO CONVINCING.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.125
I'M TALKING ABOUT HIM.

38:41.125 --> 38:43.542
I'M GONNA KICK
HIS CADILLAC-DRIVING ASS.

38:43.542 --> 38:46.500
BEFORE JACK,

38:46.500 --> 38:49.458
MY LIFE WAS
AN UNANSWERED QUESTION.

38:49.458 --> 38:51.625
UNANSWERED QUESTION.

38:51.625 --> 38:54.792
DAYS AND NIGHTS
SPENT LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

38:54.792 --> 38:57.750
QUINN PLAYED ME
LIKE A FUCKING $20 GUITAR.

38:57.750 --> 38:59.083
SHH.

38:59.083 --> 39:02.166
THE FIRST TIME
HE CAME INTO THE CAFE,

39:02.166 --> 39:05.500
I--I FELT HIM.

39:09.166 --> 39:11.542
WE WERE CONNECTED,
YOU KNOW?

39:15.166 --> 39:17.583
EVERYWHERE I WENT,
HE WAS WITH ME.

39:17.583 --> 39:19.792
JACK MADE ME REAL.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.333
MADE ME REAL.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.875
SHE BELIEVES IT...
DOWN TO HER CORE.

39:23.875 --> 39:25.500
IT'S NOT AN ACT.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.834
THE ONLY ACTOR
IN THAT ROOM IS QUINN.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.458
[cell phone vibrating]

39:37.709 --> 39:39.250
IF FIONA
CAN BE THIS CONVINCING

39:39.250 --> 39:41.291
ABOUT SOMEONE
SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW,

39:41.291 --> 39:43.709
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO CONVINCE RITA...

39:43.709 --> 39:45.667
AND OTHERS.

39:45.667 --> 39:49.375
ELLEN.

39:49.375 --> 39:50.625
HELLO?

39:50.625 --> 39:53.083
ELLEN?

40:02.625 --> 40:03.875
MMM.

40:03.875 --> 40:05.041
THANK CHRIST
YOU FOUND THE PLACE.

40:05.041 --> 40:07.875
I COULDN'T HAVE WAITED
MUCH LONGER.

40:07.875 --> 40:09.542
A CLIENT JUST SENT ME THESE.

40:09.542 --> 40:11.333
WITHOUT A RESPONSIBLE ADULT

40:11.333 --> 40:12.542
TO SHARE THEM WITH
OR SHAME ME,

40:12.542 --> 40:13.709
I WOULD EAT THEM ALL.

40:13.709 --> 40:14.959
I WOULD.

40:14.959 --> 40:16.500
TRY THAT ONE.

40:16.500 --> 40:17.667
UH-UH.

40:17.667 --> 40:20.542
SERIOUSLY,
GANACHE FROSTING.

40:22.583 --> 40:24.458
OH, WHAT THE HELL?

40:26.917 --> 40:30.250
SO I'M GUESSING YOU WANTED
TO MEET FOR REASONS

40:30.250 --> 40:33.667
OTHER THAN WORKING UP A CASE
OF TYPE 2 DIABETES.

40:33.667 --> 40:35.875
THE CHICKY HINES CONVICTION.

40:38.667 --> 40:41.083
YEAH.

40:41.083 --> 40:43.750
NOT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM'S
FINEST HOUR.

40:43.750 --> 40:45.667
MY PEOPLE
HAVE COME ACROSS EVIDENCE

40:45.667 --> 40:48.333
THAT COULD GET
THE CASE REOPENED.

40:48.333 --> 40:50.000
I LIKE THE SOUND
OF THE QUID.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.583
WHAT'S THE PRO QUO?

40:51.583 --> 40:52.417
NADA.

40:54.709 --> 40:56.959
WITNESS STATEMENT
GIVING HINES AN ALIBI,

40:56.959 --> 40:58.083
ANOTHER SUSPECT.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.625
ALL OF WHICH CHECKS OUT.

41:04.583 --> 41:05.667
OHH.

41:13.250 --> 41:15.166
TWO-PLUS DECADES
DOING THIS JOB,

41:15.166 --> 41:16.709
AND A COP'S
NEVER ONCE HANDED ME

41:16.709 --> 41:20.291
A GET-OUT-OF-JAIL CARD.

41:20.291 --> 41:22.291
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THAT COP'S GOT A HISTORY

41:22.291 --> 41:25.208
WITH THE A.D.A.
WHO PUT MY GUY AWAY.

41:25.208 --> 41:29.041
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
MIGUEL PRADO.

41:29.041 --> 41:31.041
IT'S ABOUT DOING
WHAT'S RIGHT.

41:31.041 --> 41:34.667
WELL, I'LL TAKE "YES"
FOR AN ANSWER THEN.

41:38.250 --> 41:40.000
PRADO KNOW YOU'RE
COMING TO ME WITH THIS?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.750
GUESS HE'LL FIND OUT.

41:44.750 --> 41:46.375
[both chuckle]

41:46.375 --> 41:49.041
WELL, YOU BETTER
BE WEARING OLD CLOTHES,

41:49.041 --> 41:51.125
BECAUSE THE SHIT
IS GONNA BE FLYING

41:51.125 --> 41:52.500
IN YOUR DIRECTION.

41:52.500 --> 41:53.542
HMM.

41:55.583 --> 41:56.750
HMM?

41:56.750 --> 41:58.375
WHOA.

41:58.375 --> 42:00.208
CUPCAKES AND SCOTCH.

42:00.208 --> 42:04.000
YES.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.709
COME ON.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.208
TWO FINGERS.

42:09.208 --> 42:11.000
AH.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.750
[in southern accent]
YEAH, I'M TELLIN' YOU,
I SAW FREEBO AGAIN.

42:13.750 --> 42:16.500
NO, MAN,
I'M NOT COMIN' IN.

42:16.500 --> 42:19.500
FINE, I'LL MEET YOU.
YOU GOT A FAVORITE BAR?

42:19.500 --> 42:21.750
YEAH, I KNOW IT.
ORDER ME A RUM AND COKE.

42:21.750 --> 42:23.750
I'LL BE THERE IN TEN.

42:23.750 --> 42:27.041
YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE TO WATER,
BUT YOU CAN'T MA HIM DRINK,

42:27.041 --> 42:30.792
UNLESS YOU ORDER HIS FAVORITE
AND KEEP HIM WAITING.

42:30.792 --> 42:32.542
AND WAITING.

42:37.792 --> 42:38.792
HEY.

42:38.792 --> 42:40.291
SO THE NUT JOB WENT.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.083
SHE SAID SHE CAVED
HIS HEAD IN

42:42.083 --> 42:44.500
TO PRESERVE THEIR LOVE.

42:44.500 --> 42:45.750
GOOD WORK.

42:45.750 --> 42:47.041
HOW 'BOUT
I BUY YOU A DRINK?

42:47.041 --> 42:50.500
HOW 'BOUT
YOU KISS MY ASS?

42:50.500 --> 42:52.291
NEXT TIME YOU'RE PLAYING
GOOD COP/BAD COP,

42:52.291 --> 42:53.959
YOU FUCKING LET ME KNOW
I'M PLAYING TOO.

42:53.959 --> 42:55.333
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

42:55.333 --> 42:56.417
YOU'RE SORRY?

42:56.417 --> 42:57.750
WHEN'D YOU FIGURE OUT
SHE DID IT?

42:57.750 --> 42:59.500
I HAD A HUNCH
FROM THE BEGINNING.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.792
BUT I WASN'T SURE
UNTIL YOU WERE.

43:01.792 --> 43:03.417
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

43:03.417 --> 43:04.875
'CAUSE YOU'D HAVE BLOWN IT.

43:04.875 --> 43:06.583
SO FUCK YOU.

43:06.583 --> 43:10.041
MORGAN, YOU GOT ONE TOOL
IN YOUR TOOLBOX.

43:10.041 --> 43:11.583
AND THAT'S A HAMMER.

43:11.583 --> 43:13.333
YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF.

43:13.333 --> 43:14.959
SO I PLAYED OFF IT,
AND IT WORKED.

43:17.500 --> 43:19.041
YOU JUST DON'T HAVE
A POKER FACE YET.

43:19.041 --> 43:21.709
MAYBE YOURS
IS A LITTLE TOO GOOD.

43:32.041 --> 43:33.834
DON'T YOU HAVE A LIFE?

43:33.834 --> 43:36.417
[scoffs]
NOT LATELY.

43:36.417 --> 43:37.583
WHEW.

43:37.583 --> 43:40.250
I NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT RAMON.

43:40.250 --> 43:42.500
YEAH, I HEARD
HE MADE A SCENE.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.250
SORRY.

43:44.250 --> 43:46.542
ACTUALLY,
IT WAS AN EYE-OPENER.

43:49.458 --> 43:52.875
MADE ME REALIZE
YOU WERE RIGHT.

43:52.875 --> 43:54.083
ABOUT?

43:54.083 --> 43:55.875
TELLING HIM...

43:55.875 --> 43:57.750
ABOUT FREEBO.

43:59.875 --> 44:02.458
HE'S PUTTING
HIS CAREER AT RISK.

44:02.458 --> 44:04.583
AND IT COULD HURT
YOUR REPUTATION.

44:04.583 --> 44:05.875
I'M NOT GONNA BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

44:05.875 --> 44:06.959
DON'T WORRY.

44:06.959 --> 44:08.625
RAMON WILL ALWAYS
PUT FAMILY FIRST.

44:08.625 --> 44:10.875
WE WORKED TOO HARD
TO GET TO WHERE WE ARE.

44:10.875 --> 44:12.875
HE WOULD NEVER
JEOPARDIZE THAT.

44:12.875 --> 44:14.417
AND WE CAN TRUST HIM?

44:16.291 --> 44:18.750
HE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN.

44:20.458 --> 44:22.542
WHICH WE CAN END.

44:22.542 --> 44:24.875
TONIGHT.

44:24.875 --> 44:26.875
DEX--

44:26.875 --> 44:28.041
PLEASE.

44:28.041 --> 44:29.667
JUST CALL HIM.

44:35.917 --> 44:39.458
HEY, RAMON,
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

44:39.458 --> 44:40.875
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

44:40.875 --> 44:42.709
HOLD ON.

44:44.709 --> 44:46.208
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GET THE BARTENDER

44:46.208 --> 44:48.917
TO CALL YOU A TAXI,
OR I'LL--

44:48.917 --> 44:50.667
NAH, FUCK YOU, MIGUEL.

44:50.667 --> 44:53.041
THE MOTHERFUCKING BARTENDER
WON'T EVEN GIVE ME--

44:55.875 --> 44:56.917
FUCK.

44:56.917 --> 44:58.875
[overlapping chatter]

45:08.458 --> 45:11.208
HAVING A BIG NIGHT,
HUH?

45:11.208 --> 45:12.917
WHAT I'M HAVING
IS ANOTHER DRINK,

45:12.917 --> 45:15.291
BUT THIS PRICK
IS TRYING TO CUT ME OFF.

45:15.291 --> 45:17.208
OH, AND YOU'RE HERE.

45:17.208 --> 45:18.709
BOYS' NIGHT OUT.

45:18.709 --> 45:20.709
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST
ALL GO BACK TO MY PLACE?

45:20.709 --> 45:22.917
WE CAN HAVE SYL
MAKE A LITTLE COFFEE--

45:22.917 --> 45:24.083
I'M NOT GOING
TO YOUR PLACE.

45:24.083 --> 45:26.375
I'M NOT GONNA LET SARA
AND THE KIDS SEE YOU LIKE THIS.

45:26.375 --> 45:28.458
LIKE YOU'RE SOME KIND
OF EXAMPLE IN THIS FAMILY?

45:28.458 --> 45:31.333
TURNING YOUR BACK
ON OSCARITO!

45:31.333 --> 45:33.709
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE.

45:33.709 --> 45:35.208
NOW, YOU KNOW THAT.

45:35.208 --> 45:37.291
TELL ME SOMETHING.

45:37.291 --> 45:39.208
WHY ARE YOU
RUNNING YOUR MOUTH

45:39.208 --> 45:41.083
ABOUT FAMILY BUSINESS
TO A GOD DAMN STRANGER?

45:41.083 --> 45:42.917
DEXTER IS NOT
THE PROBLEM HERE, RAMON.

45:42.917 --> 45:44.667
NOW, COME ON, PLEASE.

45:44.667 --> 45:47.166
THE TWO OF YOU COMING IN HERE
LIKE SOME FUCKING KIND

45:47.166 --> 45:49.000
OF BATMAN AND ROBIN.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.291
WHOA.

45:50.291 --> 45:52.208
KEEP YOUR FUCKING HANDS
OFF OF ME, PENDEJO.

45:52.208 --> 45:53.583
I'M SORRY, DEXTER.

45:53.583 --> 45:54.792
I GOT THIS.

45:54.792 --> 45:56.083
YOU SURE?

45:56.083 --> 45:57.542
HE SAID FUCK OFF.

45:59.750 --> 46:01.417
I'M GONNA GET
ANOTHER DRINK.

46:01.417 --> 46:03.208
HEY, THAT GUY OVER THERE,
THE DRUNK ONE,

46:03.208 --> 46:04.792
HE JUST PUT HIS HAND
ON THAT GIRL.

46:04.792 --> 46:07.792
SHE'S PRETTY UPSET,
AND I THINK I SAW A GUN.

46:21.834 --> 46:23.458
(Dexter)
I TAKE NO PLEASURE

46:23.458 --> 46:25.417
IN MANIPULATING MIGUEL
THIS WAY.

46:25.417 --> 46:27.208
STILL,
I THINK HE'D PREFER IT

46:27.208 --> 46:29.208
TO MY USUAL ALTERNATIVE.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.041
HEY.

46:36.041 --> 46:38.625
YOU DIDN'T RETURN
MY LAST TEXT.

46:41.417 --> 46:43.125
WELL, I GUESS
I RAN OUT OF WAYS TO SAY

46:43.125 --> 46:45.625
I WON'T BE
YOUR FUCKIN' RAT.

46:45.625 --> 46:48.125
HEARD YOU AND QUINN
HAD A TRICKY CASE.

46:48.125 --> 46:49.959
I JUST FILED THE REPORT.

46:49.959 --> 46:51.291
YEAH, I JUST RD IT.

46:51.291 --> 46:53.709
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT,

46:53.709 --> 46:56.542
QUINN CRACKED THE CASE
MOSTLY ON HIS OWN,

46:56.542 --> 46:59.125
AND I'M WONDERING WHY SOMEONE
HOPING TO GET HER SHIELD

46:59.125 --> 47:02.542
WOULD LET HIM
WRITE IT UP THAT WAY.

47:02.542 --> 47:04.959
I WROTE THE GOD DAMN REPORT.

47:04.959 --> 47:06.166
NOT HIM.

47:06.166 --> 47:08.291
HE GOT THE CONFESSION,
SO IT'S HIS WIN.

47:08.291 --> 47:10.458
UNLESS HE USED YOU.

47:10.458 --> 47:13.291
YOU SEE,
HE'S GOOD AT THAT.

47:13.291 --> 47:14.917
YOU PARTNER WITH HIM,
YOU TRUST HIM,

47:14.917 --> 47:17.583
AND THEN SOONER OR LATER
YOU'RE QUESTIONING YOURSELF.

47:17.583 --> 47:19.875
I MEAN,
HE'S SUCH A GREAT GUY.

47:19.875 --> 47:22.583
IT CAN'T BE HIM.

47:22.583 --> 47:25.041
EXCEPT THE ONLY QUESTION
HE'S ASKING

47:25.041 --> 47:28.333
IS HOW EVERYTHING
CAN BENEFIT HIM.

47:35.625 --> 47:37.625
[engine starts]

47:57.041 --> 47:59.709
HE BREAKFAST.

47:59.709 --> 48:01.917
THANKS FOR COMING.

48:08.625 --> 48:10.208
WE USED TO PLAY
ON THIS BEACH RIGHT HERE.

48:10.208 --> 48:12.917
ME, RAMON, OSCAR.

48:12.917 --> 48:15.083
SOUNDS FUN.

48:15.083 --> 48:17.250
AH, WE HAD EACH OTHER.

48:17.250 --> 48:18.750
ALWAYS HAVE.

48:21.458 --> 48:24.417
NO MATTER WHAT KIND
OF HORRIBLE SHIT YOU WOULD PULL,

48:24.417 --> 48:28.083
THEY KNEW YOU
INSIDE OUT,

48:28.083 --> 48:29.333
THE GOOD
AND THE BAD.

48:29.333 --> 48:32.000
AND THEY WERE THERE FOR YOU,
NO MATTER WHAT.

48:36.208 --> 48:37.917
I NEVER HAD THAT.

48:40.417 --> 48:42.792
MAYBE YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU DON'T HAVE IT TO LOSE.

48:46.166 --> 48:48.709
YOU WON'T BE LEFT
WITH A GAPING HOLE.

48:48.709 --> 48:50.583
NO, THERE'S STILL HOLES.

48:50.583 --> 48:53.083
I JUST FIND
OTHER WAYS TO FILL THEM.

48:57.166 --> 48:59.250
I LOST OSCAR TO DRUGS

48:59.250 --> 49:00.583
LONG BEFORE HE WAS KILLED.

49:00.583 --> 49:04.083
AND NOW I'M LOSING RAMON.

49:04.083 --> 49:06.125
I CAN'T FOOL MYSELF.

49:08.792 --> 49:10.291
HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

49:12.375 --> 49:14.000
IT'S LIKE...

49:14.000 --> 49:16.250
[speaks Spanish]

49:16.250 --> 49:18.917
I ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON
I CAN TRUST ANYMORE.

49:18.917 --> 49:21.417
YOURSELF.

49:21.417 --> 49:23.959
[scoffs]

49:23.959 --> 49:25.667
I WAS THINKING OF YOU.

49:30.041 --> 49:31.041
OH.

49:31.041 --> 49:32.125
OH, DON'T WORRY.

49:32.125 --> 49:35.667
I KNOW THAT TRUST DOESN'T
COME TOO EASY TO YOU.

49:35.667 --> 49:38.083
IS IT THAT OBVIOUS?

49:38.083 --> 49:40.500
WELL, TO ME.

49:40.500 --> 49:42.375
I CAN JUST SEE
THAT YOU'RE USED

49:42.375 --> 49:45.083
TO CARRYING YOUR SECRETS
TO YOURSELF.

49:46.458 --> 49:49.959
[chuckles]

49:49.959 --> 49:51.875
TENDS TO BE SAFER THAT WAY.

49:51.875 --> 49:53.834
BUT IT'S A HELL
OF A BURDEN, MAN.

49:53.834 --> 49:58.208
SEE, I'M USED
TO HAVING A BROTHER.

49:58.208 --> 50:00.583
SHARE THE LOAD.

50:09.417 --> 50:11.875
I'M HOPING MAYBE YOU'LL
GET USED TO IT TOO.

50:15.333 --> 50:19.250
(Dexter)
TO BE A BROTHER.

50:19.250 --> 50:21.125
TO HAVE A FRIEND.

50:24.333 --> 50:27.208
TO HAVE A WIFE,
A FAMILY.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.709
FIONA WANTED IT SO BAD
SHE INVENTED IT,

50:36.709 --> 50:39.041
PLAYED ALL THE PARTS HERSELF.

50:42.875 --> 50:45.375
BUT IF YOU PLAY
A ROLE LONG ENOUGH,

50:45.375 --> 50:47.125
REALLY COMMIT,

50:47.125 --> 50:49.083
DOES IT EVER BECOME REAL?

50:54.250 --> 50:58.166
COULD I BECOME REAL?

51:01.500 --> 51:04.041
HI, DEXTER.

51:04.041 --> 51:06.041
DEXTER?

51:06.041 --> 51:07.917
THIS IS A SURPRISE.
YOU DIDN'T CALL.

51:10.291 --> 51:12.417
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

51:18.375 --> 51:20.041
DEXTER, WHAT IS IT?

51:21.792 --> 51:25.291
MY LIFE
HAS ALWAYS FELT LIKE...

51:25.291 --> 51:27.291
AN UNANSWERED QUESTION.

51:29.417 --> 51:31.583
A STRING
OF DAYS AND NIGHTS,

51:31.583 --> 51:34.291
WAITING FOR SOMETHING
TO HAPPEN, BUT...

51:34.291 --> 51:36.041
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT.

51:36.041 --> 51:38.917
[whispering]
WHY IS HE ACTING SO WEIRD?

51:38.917 --> 51:41.083
[whispering]
I DON'T KNOW.

51:45.417 --> 51:47.333
RITA, WE'RE CONNECTED.

51:47.333 --> 51:50.333
WHEREVER I AM,

51:50.333 --> 51:55.166
I FEEL YOU...

51:55.166 --> 51:57.166
AND THE KIDS...

51:57.166 --> 51:59.625
WITH ME.

51:59.625 --> 52:02.417
YOU'RE WHAT MAKES ME REAL.

52:02.417 --> 52:05.041
[voice catches]

52:05.041 --> 52:08.333
I WANT US TO...

52:08.333 --> 52:11.625
ALWAYS GO OUT
FOR BANANA SPLITS.

52:11.625 --> 52:13.375
AND REPLANT THE LEMON TREE

52:13.375 --> 52:15.166
THAT KEEPS DYING.

52:15.166 --> 52:17.583
AND I NEVER, EVER
WANT TO MISS A PIZZA NIGHT.

52:17.583 --> 52:19.583
[tearful laugh]

52:19.583 --> 52:22.333
AND THAT'S HOW I KNOW
I WANT TO MARRY YOU.

52:24.542 --> 52:26.000
BECAUSE SOMETHING
AS SIMPLE AS PIZZA NIGHT

52:26.000 --> 52:27.750
IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY WEEK.

52:29.834 --> 52:31.750
BUT NOT WITHOUT THE KIDS.

52:33.875 --> 52:36.208
CODY, ASTOR,

52:36.208 --> 52:38.333
YOU GUYS ARE MY FAMILY.

52:40.959 --> 52:42.917
I'M GONNA HANG ON TO YOU
FOR DEAR LIFE.

52:46.250 --> 52:48.125
PLEASE, SAY YES.

52:53.125 --> 52:54.917
[tearful laugh]

52:54.917 --> 52:56.417
YES!

52:56.417 --> 52:58.166
YES, WE WILL MARRY YOU.

53:06.583 --> 53:08.917
MOST ACTORS
TOIL IN OBSCURITY,

53:08.917 --> 53:12.250
NEVER STEPPING
INTO THE SPOTLIGHT.

53:12.250 --> 53:13.709
BUT IF YOU HONE YOUR CRAFT,

53:13.709 --> 53:15.583
WORK DILIGENTLY,

53:15.583 --> 53:17.417
YOU MIGHT
JUST FIND YOURSELF

53:17.417 --> 53:20.917
CAST IN THE ROLE
OF A LIFETIME.
