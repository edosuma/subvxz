00:54.831 --> 00:56.298
Baby-sitters Club.

00:56.499 --> 00:58.330
This is Mrs. Rodowsky.

00:58.401 --> 01:02.565
Hi. We´re going out for dinner on Tuesday
with the whole family.

01:02.638 --> 01:05.630
l was wondering, would any of you mind
baby-sitting the dog?

01:05.708 --> 01:08.404
l mean, he just hates to be left alone.

01:42.712 --> 01:44.077
Baby-sitters Club.

01:44.914 --> 01:49.044
l´m on a car phone. l need a sitter
for tonight. lt´s an emergency.

01:50.820 --> 01:54.017
Hi, this is Mrs. Wilder.
l´m having a birthday party for Rosie...

01:54.090 --> 01:56.524
and do any of you dress up as clowns?

01:57.360 --> 01:58.850
Hi, l need a sitter tonight.

01:58.928 --> 02:02.056
My sister was gonna watch the kids,
but she flaked out.

02:02.665 --> 02:06.396
lt´s me again. My wife´s going
into the hospital any minute.

02:06.469 --> 02:08.994
We´re pregnant. No, l mean, she´s pregnant.

02:09.072 --> 02:11.870
Anyway, we´ve got a toddler at home and....

02:46.809 --> 02:48.003
Baby-sitters Club.

02:48.077 --> 02:50.568
We´re gonna need a baby-sitter
Saturday night.

02:50.646 --> 02:52.807
We need a baby-sitter on Friday night.

02:52.882 --> 02:56.079
l know it´s only August,
but could l book for New Year´s Eve?

02:56.152 --> 02:58.177
Yeah. lt´s me again. Listen.

02:58.254 --> 03:01.087
ls anyone, like, immediately....

03:47.370 --> 03:47.537
My name is Kristy. l´m the founding member
of the Baby-sitters Club.

03:47.537 --> 03:51.530
My name is Kristy. l´m the founding member
of the Baby-sitters Club.

03:51.774 --> 03:54.504
l don´t mean to brag,
but we´re famous here in Stoneybrook.

03:54.577 --> 03:55.601
Hey, Kristy!

03:55.678 --> 03:58.704
Everybody knows us.
That´s because everybody uses us.

03:59.148 --> 04:00.445
You call one number...

04:00.516 --> 04:03.576
and get connected
to seven incredible baby-sitters.

04:10.259 --> 04:12.989
This is Stacey. She´s our club treasurer.

04:13.062 --> 04:16.759
She´s good at keeping track of money.
She´s also good at spending it.

04:16.832 --> 04:20.632
Stace was raised in New York City.
Sometimes she thinks she still lives there.

04:20.702 --> 04:21.863
358 Bradford Court.

04:23.005 --> 04:24.097
That´s Mary Anne.

04:24.173 --> 04:26.971
When we were little,
we used to live next door to each other.

04:27.043 --> 04:29.238
She´s kind of quiet, kind of serious.

04:29.312 --> 04:32.304
Why are we friends?
They say opposites attract.

04:33.716 --> 04:35.513
Dawn is Mary Anne´s stepsister.

04:35.585 --> 04:37.450
She grew up in California.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.818
Dawn really cares about the environment.

04:39.889 --> 04:43.416
Her biggest regret is that
she wasn´t born on Earth Day.

04:44.694 --> 04:47.492
Claudia´s an amazing artist.
She´s really talented.

04:47.797 --> 04:52.097
Do you know anybody who could take a fork
and a hammer and turn it into that?

04:53.769 --> 04:57.102
And, of course, Mallory.
She´s a junior member of the club.

04:57.173 --> 04:58.970
She wants to be a writer.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.202
She started her novel when she turned 11...

05:01.277 --> 05:04.508
and is determined to finish it
by the time she´s eleven-and-a-half.

05:06.449 --> 05:08.417
Jessi is Mallory´s best friend.

05:08.484 --> 05:10.975
She´s 11, too, and our other junior member.

05:11.053 --> 05:13.920
Jessi´s motto is.:
´´Why walk when you can dance?´´

05:15.391 --> 05:18.053
You know, we´re more than just a club.

05:18.127 --> 05:20.755
We´re friends. Best friends.

05:20.830 --> 05:23.094
Nothing could ever change that.

05:25.635 --> 05:28.661
Dawn, l heard that Alan Gray likes you.

05:28.738 --> 05:31.366
Likes her, or ´´like´´ likes her?

05:31.440 --> 05:34.307
That dweeb? Spare me.
lt doesn´t matter anyway...

05:34.377 --> 05:37.175
because l don´t like him or ´´like´´ like him.

05:37.246 --> 05:40.238
Something´s wrong here, you guys.
School´s out, and l miss it.

05:40.316 --> 05:42.511
l know. lt´s not that l love it. lt´s just....

05:42.585 --> 05:46.419
-We don´t see each other every day?
-We end up baby-sitting at different houses.

05:46.489 --> 05:49.185
-We might as well be on separate planets.
-Yeah.

05:51.894 --> 05:55.728
The first Baby-sitters Club meeting
of the summer is now called to order.

05:55.798 --> 05:59.734
We have our meetings in Claudia´s room.
lt´s the best part of the week.

05:59.802 --> 06:02.566
We started there
because she´s the only one with a phone...

06:02.638 --> 06:04.265
but now it´s home.

06:04.340 --> 06:07.832
-Soy-meal chips? Forget it.
-They´re good for sugar addiction.

06:07.910 --> 06:10.504
l know l´m late,
but there was this really big--

06:10.579 --> 06:11.603
Sale!

06:11.681 --> 06:13.774
What´d you get this time?

06:14.417 --> 06:16.783
-You´re too much.
-Baby-sitters Club.

06:17.186 --> 06:18.619
Hi, Mrs. Rodowsky.

06:19.488 --> 06:22.286
Wednesday night, 6:00 to 9:30. Sure.

06:22.858 --> 06:25.383
-Got it. Hold on. Who´s free Wednesday?
-Not me.

06:25.461 --> 06:27.554
According to the schedule...

06:28.397 --> 06:30.092
you and me, but count me out.

06:30.166 --> 06:33.602
Last time it took me two hours
to get that dog clean.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.431
Okay, Mrs. Rodowsky, you´re all set.

06:36.505 --> 06:39.668
l´ll be there at 6:00 sharp. Okay, bye.

06:40.710 --> 06:44.612
l know Jackie Rodowsky´s
a walking disaster, but l like him, okay?

06:44.680 --> 06:46.910
-New business.
-We have a tragedy here.

06:46.982 --> 06:49.450
l flunked science
and l have to go to summer school.

06:49.518 --> 06:52.180
-Are your parents gonna kill you?
-Maybe.

06:52.254 --> 06:55.451
Don´t sweat it, Claud.
l got straight A´s in science this year.

06:55.524 --> 06:57.788
-l´ll coach you.
-Claud, you´re an artist.

06:57.860 --> 07:00.124
-You don´t have to be a scientist.
-She´s right.

07:00.196 --> 07:03.893
Tell that to my mom. lf l don´t get a C plus,
l have to drop out of the club.

07:04.266 --> 07:07.258
-Don´t worry. We´ll help you.
-You´ll pass. Promise.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.062
What if l don´t?

07:13.376 --> 07:15.003
Baby-sitters Club.

07:21.384 --> 07:23.147
Okay, l´ll tell her.

07:23.786 --> 07:27.722
Stace, that was Ms. Wilder. She says that
her little nephew´s coming in tonight.

07:27.790 --> 07:31.487
-He´s from Switzerland.
-Great. l love little kids with accents.

07:32.795 --> 07:33.989
Hello!

07:38.334 --> 07:41.428
-Hi, Stacey.
-Hi, Rosie. You´re getting so good.

07:41.504 --> 07:42.493
Thank you.

07:42.571 --> 07:46.029
l have a treat for you in the Kid Kit:
extra stickers and puzzles.

07:46.108 --> 07:47.097
Great.

07:47.610 --> 07:51.171
And l brought something
for your little cousin. Where is he?

07:51.247 --> 07:52.771
Hi, l´m Luca...

07:52.848 --> 07:54.509
the little cousin.

07:58.354 --> 07:59.981
You brought me a gift?

08:02.691 --> 08:06.354
lt´s just a small, little...

08:07.696 --> 08:09.994
American flag thing.

08:15.337 --> 08:17.703
Cool. Very nationalistic.

08:18.340 --> 08:19.830
And you´re....

08:20.409 --> 08:23.310
Stacey. Your sitter, l guess.

08:25.281 --> 08:27.977
l thought you were going to the movies.

08:28.350 --> 08:30.841
l have my whole life to go to the movies.

08:43.466 --> 08:45.161
Have you seen Karen and Andrew?

08:45.234 --> 08:47.702
Weren´t they
with David Michael and Emily Michelle?

08:47.770 --> 08:50.466
-This house is too big.
-Can l have my own phone?

08:50.539 --> 08:51.563
-Andrew!
-No.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.632
-But l need it for business.
-When you´re 16.

08:54.710 --> 08:58.305
-Kristy, have you seen Karen and Andrew?
-But this doesn´t make any sense.

08:58.380 --> 09:00.007
lt doesn´t have to.

09:00.115 --> 09:04.142
You won´t let me have BSC meetings here.
At least give me a phone.

09:04.220 --> 09:08.816
We live too far away to have them here,
and l don´t want you to have a phone.

09:08.891 --> 09:10.882
They´re not upstairs or in the garage.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.019
-You can´t just say no.
-Karen!

09:13.095 --> 09:15.859
A good parent would give their child
a logical reason.

09:15.931 --> 09:18.923
-l don´t want you to be spoiled.
-l´m already spoiled.

09:19.001 --> 09:20.434
They have to be somewhere.

09:20.503 --> 09:23.472
Where? They´re not upstairs.
They´re not under the beds.

09:23.539 --> 09:25.564
l looked under the beds. l looked under--

09:25.641 --> 09:26.733
l know.

09:26.809 --> 09:30.074
They´re with Colonel Mustard in the library
with the wrench.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.909
l´m Pirate Esmeralda, and this is my slave.

09:36.385 --> 09:38.819
What would you guys do without me?

09:39.922 --> 09:43.221
Thanks for helping me baby-sit.
Here´s half of what l made tonight.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.055
No, keep your money.

09:45.594 --> 09:48.290
You know,
l baby-sit Rosie every Wednesday.

09:48.364 --> 09:50.229
From 7:30 to 9:30.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.665
What about every other night of your life?

09:52.735 --> 09:55.898
-Do you like the movies?
-Mary Poppins is her favorite.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.462
We´ve seen that video 100,000 times.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.900
Well, l baby-sit her a lot.

10:03.812 --> 10:07.111
Why don´t you go out with me Saturday?
We could go to the movies.

10:07.182 --> 10:10.583
lf nothing is playing,
you could show me around Stoneybrook.

10:11.186 --> 10:12.915
This is kinda it.

10:12.988 --> 10:15.582
lt´s not like New York City or anything.

10:15.658 --> 10:18.354
That´s where l grew up.
Have you ever been there?

10:18.427 --> 10:21.089
-No, not yet.
-lt´s the best.

10:22.197 --> 10:23.687
You mean, like you?

10:26.535 --> 10:28.435
Are you gonna kiss her?

10:29.638 --> 10:32.266
Whatever gave you that idea, Rosalind?

10:32.808 --> 10:34.469
Come on, let´s go.

10:36.712 --> 10:39.977
-Don´t let them burn.
-Do you think l should have told him?

10:40.049 --> 10:41.880
-What? Who?
-Luca.

10:41.951 --> 10:43.714
He doesn´t know l have diabetes.

10:43.786 --> 10:47.620
lt´s not like you have the flu or something.
He can´t catch it.

10:47.690 --> 10:51.057
Yeah, l mean, if he´s any kind of guy,
he won´t care.

10:51.260 --> 10:53.694
l don´t want him to know.
He´ll think l´m pathetic.

10:53.762 --> 10:57.664
We all know. We don´t think you´re pathetic.
A little psycho maybe.

10:57.733 --> 10:59.598
He also doesn´t know l´m only 13.

10:59.668 --> 11:01.636
-So?
-He´s 1 7.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.070
-That´s ancient.
-He´s a poet.

11:04.139 --> 11:05.936
-He drives.
-He´s a musical genius.

11:06.008 --> 11:08.977
-He´s been to Europe.
-He´s from Europe.

11:10.312 --> 11:11.745
-Cough it up.
-Here´s mine.

11:11.814 --> 11:13.076
-Count me in.
-l forgot mine.

11:13.148 --> 11:14.775
Stace, treasurer´s report.

11:14.850 --> 11:16.784
After dues, we´ll have $58.

11:16.852 --> 11:19.412
But after the phone bill
and Kid Kit supplies...

11:19.488 --> 11:21.718
we´ll have $1 1 .47.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.257
-That´s all?
-We´re loaded.

11:23.325 --> 11:25.054
Okay, new business.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.157
l have a brilliant idea.

11:29.498 --> 11:31.625
Stoneybrook Summer Camp for Seniors?

11:31.700 --> 11:34.328
No! A day camp for our clients.

11:34.603 --> 11:38.300
lt´ll give us a new service to offer.
lt´ll be a total gold mine...

11:38.374 --> 11:41.935
and most important, it´s a way for us
to stay together the whole summer.

11:42.011 --> 11:44.571
ls this not the most brilliant idea yet?

11:48.050 --> 11:52.009
Last time she was like this,
she wanted us to open a dude ranch.

11:52.087 --> 11:55.989
No, seriously, you guys.
lt´ll be so easy, and the kids´ll love it.

11:56.058 --> 11:59.323
We can go from 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday or something.

11:59.395 --> 12:02.228
We can start after the Fourth of July,
give us time to set up.

12:02.297 --> 12:05.027
l don´t know what we´ll charge,
but we can figure that out.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.467
l´ve put together some start-up budgets
and schedules to check out.

12:08.537 --> 12:10.061
Here, you guys.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.772
-lt looks good, Kristy.
-You guys share.

12:14.343 --> 12:18.404
Kristy, this brilliant idea
might really be brilliant.

12:23.919 --> 12:26.752
My dad said we could use the yard,
but there are a few rules.

12:26.822 --> 12:28.551
The first, in bold print and underlined:

12:28.624 --> 12:31.184
-´´The house is off-limits to children.´´
-´´At all times.´´

12:31.260 --> 12:33.319
-How many pages are there?
-Don´t ask.

12:33.395 --> 12:36.023
Just our luck
your dad´s a lawyer, Mary Anne.

12:36.098 --> 12:37.861
Okay, let´s start marking it off.

12:37.933 --> 12:41.130
-Let´s put the sports area....
-Let´s put it over there.

12:41.203 --> 12:43.831
-The dance area over there.
-First-aid tent back there.

12:43.906 --> 12:47.342
-What about arts and crafts?
-We can line up Porta-Potties by the fence.

12:47.409 --> 12:49.570
Perfect. We´ll put the garbage cans
next to them.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.840
-Will the neighbors be a problem?
-They´re cool.

12:51.914 --> 12:54.314
-What about the new one?
-What about her?

12:54.516 --> 12:57.212
You guys, my dad needs us
to sign this contract...

12:57.286 --> 12:59.550
and initial all the pages he´s marked.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.718
-Put your John Hancock right there.
-This will be great.

13:02.791 --> 13:05.282
Shouldn´t we read this before we sign it?

13:14.737 --> 13:18.730
Jackie Rodowsky´s one of my best clients
and the first camper to sign up.

13:18.807 --> 13:21.105
His dream is to hit a home run.

13:21.243 --> 13:23.643
Problem is, he can´t even hit a ball.

13:23.712 --> 13:27.808
Too bad he doesn´t want to be a jockey,
because he can stay on a horse.

13:28.751 --> 13:31.083
Cokie Mason´s hated us
since the third grade.

13:31.153 --> 13:32.882
Everyone´s forgotten why.

13:32.955 --> 13:36.254
Her number-one mission in life
is to put the BSC out of business.

13:36.325 --> 13:38.384
Your helmet´s on backwards.

13:38.460 --> 13:40.587
Hurts my ears the other way.

13:45.334 --> 13:47.666
That´s Logan Bruno, Mary Anne´s boyfriend.

13:47.736 --> 13:50.204
He´s an associate member of the BSC.

13:50.272 --> 13:53.935
Mary Anne´s been in love with Logan
since he moved here from Kentucky.

13:54.009 --> 13:56.375
Unfortunately, so has Cokie Mason.

13:56.445 --> 13:59.505
Look at Kristy
and her band of goody two-shoes.

14:00.249 --> 14:03.548
What do they think they are?
One big, happy family?

14:04.219 --> 14:07.882
-Kristy, this horse won´t let me down.
-Hey, you all. How´s the ride?

14:07.956 --> 14:11.221
l´ll grab Logan´s arm
and you go distract Mary Anne, okay?

14:11.293 --> 14:12.851
What if she doesn´t leave him alone?

14:12.928 --> 14:16.295
Mary Anne and Logan
never let each other out of their sight.

14:16.365 --> 14:18.731
What are they afraid of? Moi?

14:21.236 --> 14:23.966
Logan, l´m so glad you´re here.

14:24.039 --> 14:26.473
-l wanted to call you.
-Oh, yeah?

14:26.542 --> 14:29.670
-Get lost, Cokie.
-Hello, Kristin.

14:30.279 --> 14:31.940
You have a date...

14:32.047 --> 14:36.381
and l can see his age is the same as your lQ.

14:36.718 --> 14:39.482
Who let you out
of that bat cave, Marguerite?

14:39.555 --> 14:41.614
She hates to be called that.

14:41.690 --> 14:43.555
That´s your real name?

14:44.026 --> 14:46.995
No. lt´s the mumbling of an idiot.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.131
Stall her.

14:54.203 --> 14:55.898
Go do what l said.

15:01.643 --> 15:03.110
l have to talk to you.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.645
Mary Anne?

15:09.184 --> 15:10.845
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:14.022 --> 15:15.114
Wait!

15:16.491 --> 15:19.324
What classes are you taking next year?

15:19.628 --> 15:22.222
l don´t really know yet. Why?

15:24.600 --> 15:26.898
Can l try on your riding pants?

15:28.937 --> 15:31.997
-Fifth row? Center? How´d you get them?
-Logan?

15:32.374 --> 15:34.239
l knew you´d say yes. Just think.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.470
You, me, and Smashing Pumpkins.

15:36.545 --> 15:38.604
-What are you doing?
-Cokie, l....

15:38.680 --> 15:40.147
-Cokie?
-What?

15:40.515 --> 15:43.279
-Don´t you have somewhere else to be?
-Don´t waste my time.

15:43.352 --> 15:45.320
Logan, call me tomorrow.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.082
Logan, l don´t believe you.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.819
Come on, let´s go.

16:36.071 --> 16:38.005
She´s eating seeds again.

16:38.073 --> 16:42.271
lsn´t it great how every time we come here
the burgers taste the same?

16:42.344 --> 16:45.575
l like that. Something you can count on.

16:45.647 --> 16:48.343
Dawn, have you watered yourself lately?

16:48.417 --> 16:49.543
What?

16:50.686 --> 16:53.951
Kristy, you got a birthday coming up.
What should we do?

16:54.022 --> 16:57.856
l don´t know. Just as long as
it´s the best day of my life. But no pressure.

16:57.926 --> 17:00.986
Guys, $250 per camper.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.863
lf 30 campers sign up, that´s $7,500.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.266
We´re rich.

17:07.336 --> 17:10.863
-We can almost buy a car.
-ln five years, we can drive it.

17:10.939 --> 17:13.601
lf we get enough money,
we can open our own office.

17:13.675 --> 17:16.337
-That´s a great idea.
-We could get a fax machine.

17:16.411 --> 17:19.847
-Go international.
-That´ll sure let me off the hook if l flunk.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.816
-You´re not gonna flunk.
-Claud, l´ll help you.

17:23.218 --> 17:24.207
Okay.

17:24.819 --> 17:26.310
l say we start looking.

17:26.387 --> 17:28.288
How many people have we signed up?

17:28.357 --> 17:30.325
On our last count, we had...

17:31.560 --> 17:32.754
twelve.

17:36.331 --> 17:38.526
We passed out a million fliers.

17:38.600 --> 17:42.161
-My brother David Michael will come.
-How´s your little day camp going?

17:42.237 --> 17:44.603
-Great. Couldn´t be better.
-Really?

17:45.040 --> 17:46.940
l happened to find a few of these...

17:47.009 --> 17:49.034
flying around Main Street.

17:50.579 --> 17:52.012
Mary Anne...

17:52.414 --> 17:55.315
l got the most outrageous outfit
for the concert.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.283
l´m not going to cry.

18:03.225 --> 18:04.954
l´ll be right back.

18:08.096 --> 18:11.759
Listen, you guys, we´ve been fighting
each other since the third grade...

18:11.833 --> 18:15.530
and now that we´re getting older,
don´t you think it´s time we stop?

18:15.604 --> 18:17.071
We´re having our annual BSC party...

18:17.139 --> 18:19.607
-tomorrow night at Miller´s Park at 8:00.
-What party?

18:19.674 --> 18:23.576
lf you could come,
it would be great, 8:00 sharp.

18:23.845 --> 18:25.437
Right, l´m sure.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.339
-What?
-l don´t know.

18:28.417 --> 18:31.284
-We don´t have anything to do tomorrow.
-Of course we do.

18:31.353 --> 18:34.049
lt´s Friday night.
We´ll be hanging out at Pizza Express.

18:34.122 --> 18:37.182
l think we should go.
Besides, they´re kind of cool.

18:38.293 --> 18:39.624
They´re not cool.

18:39.694 --> 18:42.561
We´re cool, and don´t you ever forget that.

18:43.031 --> 18:44.999
-What´s up?
-You´ll find out.

18:46.334 --> 18:49.462
Let´s see how cheese-ball
this baby-sitters´ party is gonna be.

18:49.538 --> 18:52.029
-They´re such girl scouts.
-Why are we here then?

18:52.107 --> 18:54.098
Logan Bruno will be here.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.443
What does he see in Mary Anne, anyway?

18:56.511 --> 18:59.105
She´s pretty, she´s nice,
and she´s really sweet.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.170
So?

19:00.982 --> 19:02.711
Where is everybody?

19:07.656 --> 19:08.723
Welcome to the official opening
of the first day...

19:08.723 --> 19:10.884
Welcome to the official opening
of the first day...

19:10.959 --> 19:13.359
of the Baby-sitters Club Summer Day Camp.

19:13.428 --> 19:17.262
Getting even with Cokie was easy.
Then we had to get the camp off the ground.

19:17.332 --> 19:20.165
Every day had a plan,
every plan had a backup...

19:20.235 --> 19:22.465
and every backup had a fallback.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.404
Lots of our regulars signed up,
and some new kids, too.

19:25.474 --> 19:29.535
Boy, were they enthusiastic.
And us, we were ready for anything.

19:29.611 --> 19:31.875
At least, that´s what we thought.

19:31.947 --> 19:35.883
0n behalf of every one of our baby-sitters,
we have a souvenir for you...

19:35.951 --> 19:37.976
which also serves a very important purpose.:

19:38.053 --> 19:41.682
lt connects you with your counselor
and is very handy in the kitchen.

19:41.756 --> 19:45.590
Don´t hesitate to use this
with your friends, family, and favorite foods.

19:46.094 --> 19:48.358
Please note the color of your potholder.

19:48.430 --> 19:51.831
Go directly to the counselor
wearing the same color potholder as you.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.094
Thank you.

19:53.168 --> 19:55.466
The preparation phase was a nightmare...

19:55.537 --> 19:58.938
but we had to stick it out
´cause we were gonna make a fortune.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.342
Can l have one for Jimmy-Tony?

20:05.614 --> 20:07.445
How old is Jimmy-Tony?

20:07.682 --> 20:10.310
Jimmy-Tony, they want to know
how old you are.

20:12.454 --> 20:14.183
He´s the same age as me.

20:15.323 --> 20:18.019
Well, then he gets a red one, too.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.321
Come on.

20:20.495 --> 20:22.986
-Okay, he´s paid.
-Kristy, look.

20:23.064 --> 20:25.259
Green. Same as you.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.096
-What do we got?
-Can l have one?

20:27.169 --> 20:28.227
What?

20:28.303 --> 20:30.464
She said she wants a potholder.

20:34.042 --> 20:35.270
See you.

20:36.678 --> 20:39.806
My mom was wondering,
well, there´s two of us...

20:39.881 --> 20:41.405
and l was wondering, too.

20:41.483 --> 20:45.249
My mom and dad talked, and they
don´t think me and my sister should come...

20:45.320 --> 20:48.483
because it´ll be too much money,
so l was wondering:

20:48.557 --> 20:52.493
Since my sister´s so small,
could we both get in for the price of one?

20:53.128 --> 20:54.993
l´ve been to the moon.

21:03.405 --> 21:04.804
Over there!

21:17.018 --> 21:20.215
On your mark! Get set! Go!

21:20.288 --> 21:22.483
Come on, you guys! Come on!

21:25.160 --> 21:27.526
Come on, guys! Go!

21:29.431 --> 21:31.956
-l´ve got to go to the bathroom!
-Me, too!

21:33.535 --> 21:34.900
Bathroom?

21:34.970 --> 21:38.770
Got to go to the bathroom?
Okay, hold on. Give me one second.

21:38.974 --> 21:40.771
Stacey, where are the Porta-Potties?

21:40.842 --> 21:43.367
The guy said they were coming
at 8:00 this morning.

21:43.445 --> 21:44.878
l´ve got to go now!

21:45.547 --> 21:48.277
-Get me out of here!
-We have to use your house.

21:48.650 --> 21:50.208
No way. My mom will kill us.

21:50.285 --> 21:52.617
They have to go to the bathroom!

22:02.030 --> 22:05.227
Suzi, what are you doing in there?

22:06.334 --> 22:07.892
Shaving.

22:11.973 --> 22:13.600
Oh, no. The neb.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.737
-Alan Gray.
-Hide me.

22:20.615 --> 22:22.173
Get back. Back.

22:22.250 --> 22:25.048
-Okay, turn. Good.
-You sure you don´t need any help?

22:25.120 --> 22:29.113
-l think you all should think about it.
-´Cause this is my last offer.

22:30.458 --> 22:32.153
Sounds like your first offer.

22:32.227 --> 22:36.664
l´d snap him up if l was you all,
´cause he´s really great with the kids.

22:36.865 --> 22:39.698
-How much would you want?
-Not much.

22:40.001 --> 22:41.491
Like how much?

22:41.836 --> 22:43.303
Like nothing.

22:43.638 --> 22:45.936
-When can you start?
-Yesterday.

22:47.976 --> 22:49.967
-You got a deal.
-Kristy!

22:50.578 --> 22:52.569
-He´s a dweeb.
-He´s a free dweeb.

22:52.647 --> 22:54.547
Yeah, l´m a free dweeb.

22:59.220 --> 23:02.383
l said get her a flower,
not squirt her with one.

23:02.957 --> 23:04.117
Right.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.254
Sorry.

23:08.930 --> 23:11.262
Logan said he wouldn´t have gone
with Cokie.

23:11.333 --> 23:14.097
But what if he did?
What would you have done?

23:14.169 --> 23:16.603
-Nothing.
-You couldn´t do nothing!

23:16.671 --> 23:18.866
lf he wants to do something,
l can´t stop him.

23:18.940 --> 23:22.273
Yes, you can. You can tell somebody
when you´re ticked off.

23:22.344 --> 23:24.938
We can´t let men get away with everything.

23:28.249 --> 23:29.978
Kristy, hi.

23:30.985 --> 23:32.509
-How you doing?
-Dad?

23:37.158 --> 23:38.819
You grew a beard.

23:40.128 --> 23:43.359
-A while ago. You must be Kristy´s friend.
-Mary Anne.

23:44.132 --> 23:46.930
Sure, you´re Richard Spier´s little girl.

23:47.969 --> 23:49.937
l´d better go.

23:50.004 --> 23:52.165
lt was nice seeing you again, Mr. Thomas.

23:52.240 --> 23:53.264
Patrick.

23:53.641 --> 23:56.166
-Call me, or l´ll call you.
-Call me.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.979
Sorry, l didn´t mean to surprise you
like this.

24:02.050 --> 24:03.950
What are you doing here?

24:04.018 --> 24:07.146
Didn´t you get my postcard?
l said l´d be coming.

24:07.222 --> 24:09.656
Dad, you always say you´ll be coming.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.688
You look great.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.691
l mean, what, it´s been....

24:21.169 --> 24:23.103
l mean, you were....

24:27.542 --> 24:29.737
So how was school this year?

24:29.811 --> 24:31.574
-Okay.
-Did you like it?

24:31.846 --> 24:33.575
-Yeah.
-Did you get good grades?

24:33.648 --> 24:34.910
Guess so.

24:36.584 --> 24:39.144
So you hungry? Wanna go get a pizza?

24:43.057 --> 24:44.718
Why are you here?

24:47.295 --> 24:50.025
Look, l know it´s weird just showing up...

24:50.098 --> 24:51.929
but there´s...

24:52.767 --> 24:54.997
really no other way l could figure to do it.

24:55.069 --> 24:56.297
Do what?

24:56.938 --> 24:58.929
-l´m moving back.
-You are?

24:59.407 --> 25:02.604
Yeah, l have a shot at a sports column
with The News.

25:03.144 --> 25:06.807
l didn´t want to say anything
till it was a sure thing, but l....

25:06.881 --> 25:09.179
You know, l couldn´t resist seeing you.

25:09.250 --> 25:10.945
Have you seen Mom?

25:13.988 --> 25:15.216
Not yet.

25:17.258 --> 25:19.385
She´s probably in the house.

25:21.529 --> 25:25.693
l don´t want her to really know l´m here yet.
Not till l hear about the job, okay?

25:25.767 --> 25:28.327
Think we could keep it a secret
for a couple of days?

25:28.403 --> 25:29.392
l guess.

25:33.274 --> 25:34.366
Good.

25:42.116 --> 25:45.085
l like your hair long. lt looks really cool.

25:47.222 --> 25:50.749
l´ll be staying at the Strathmore lnn
if you want to reach me.

25:50.825 --> 25:53.225
And don´t forget, l owe you a pizza.

25:53.294 --> 25:55.319
Still like anchovies best?

25:56.097 --> 25:57.086
Yeah?

25:58.066 --> 25:59.055
Okay.

26:41.442 --> 26:43.467
0ne, two, three, four, five!

26:55.690 --> 26:56.987
Howdy, partners!

26:57.058 --> 27:00.152
Just remember, it´s Cowboy Day!

27:00.228 --> 27:01.820
l mean ´´Cowgirl´´!

27:02.764 --> 27:04.493
lt´s Cowpeople Day!

27:04.866 --> 27:07.391
Sit tall on your saddles.
Walk like you mean it.

27:07.468 --> 27:10.904
And remember, one person
in the Porta-Potty at a time.

27:11.239 --> 27:13.571
-Dawn?
-Thank you, Kristy.

27:16.244 --> 27:18.644
The Earth can do anything
if you treat it right.

27:18.713 --> 27:20.112
Howdy, Dawn!

27:21.482 --> 27:22.574
Alan!

27:24.052 --> 27:26.418
What did you do that for?

27:26.988 --> 27:29.821
Alan, why do you act like such a bonehead?

27:31.059 --> 27:32.583
No good reason.

27:34.762 --> 27:37.287
Look alive over here!
Let´s hear some chatter!

27:37.365 --> 27:39.424
Why? He´s not gonna hit it.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.492
Yeah! No way is he gonna hit that ball!

27:42.570 --> 27:46.131
You got to strike out a couple times
before you hit a home run.

27:54.115 --> 27:56.709
He´s never gonna hit the ball!

27:57.151 --> 28:00.780
This is it. l can feel it.
l can see it in your elbow.

28:01.189 --> 28:03.817
He stinks! He´s the worst!

28:03.891 --> 28:05.756
He´s not gonna hit it!

28:13.868 --> 28:16.894
Mary here is on a time out
for sticking gum in Charlotte´s hair.

28:16.971 --> 28:18.165
Margie.

28:18.806 --> 28:21.297
-Margie, how old are you?
-Four-and-a-half.

28:21.376 --> 28:25.005
-You´re on a four-and-a-half minute time out.
-No, l´m two.

28:31.386 --> 28:33.980
-What do you think?
-l don´t really belong here.

28:34.055 --> 28:36.080
Please, you´ve got to come with me.

28:36.157 --> 28:38.591
Kristy, it isn´t like you´re six or something.

28:38.660 --> 28:42.619
l mean, you´re almost 13.
lt´s not like you need a chaperone.

28:44.532 --> 28:46.432
l don´t wanna go alone.

28:54.676 --> 28:58.168
Kristy, you´re gonna love this.
You too, Mary Anne, l hope.

28:58.246 --> 29:01.443
That´s okay. l don´t have to eat.
l could even leave.

29:01.516 --> 29:03.643
No. She´ll eat anything.

29:05.386 --> 29:08.014
Good, because my hotel
didn´t have a kitchen...

29:08.089 --> 29:10.956
and l wanted to make you
something really special.

29:11.592 --> 29:13.560
-So guess what it is.
-l don´t know.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.152
You don´t know?

29:18.433 --> 29:19.832
Mouse pancakes.

29:19.901 --> 29:22.961
Yeah, mouse pancakes.

29:23.471 --> 29:26.998
Wow, Dad. l mean Patrick.

29:29.077 --> 29:30.601
What´s in this?

29:30.678 --> 29:32.543
-Pancake mix.
-You´re a little rusty.

29:32.613 --> 29:34.604
When Kristy was little...

29:34.682 --> 29:37.947
the only way l could get her to eat
was to make her mouse pancakes.

29:38.019 --> 29:40.715
So we did every Sunday morning.
Right, pal?

29:41.022 --> 29:42.751
So when are you gonna call Mom?

29:42.824 --> 29:44.985
Soon. l´ve been really busy.

29:46.561 --> 29:49.223
Dad, a phone call
doesn´t take that much time.

29:51.065 --> 29:53.260
l´m gonna go to the bathroom.

29:58.005 --> 29:59.370
Where is it?

29:59.440 --> 30:03.342
Rest rooms. See that maple down there?
You take a left at the maple.

30:03.411 --> 30:05.345
Don´t worry, they´re clean.

30:11.486 --> 30:13.351
Your mom thinks l´m a loser.

30:13.855 --> 30:16.824
All right? So before l walk
into that mansion you live in...

30:16.891 --> 30:19.826
l gotta have a job, l gotta have a home...

30:20.194 --> 30:22.822
and a few things put together,
you know what l mean?

30:22.897 --> 30:26.697
Plus Chris Almond at the paper says
a couple days, a week tops.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.637
Think you can give me that?

30:30.805 --> 30:32.170
l guess so.

30:35.076 --> 30:36.168
Good.

30:37.311 --> 30:39.074
l got you something.

30:58.166 --> 30:59.360
Thanks!

31:02.370 --> 31:06.363
-What? You don´t like it? l can take it back.
-No, don´t do that.

31:07.375 --> 31:08.842
lt´s really nice...

31:09.410 --> 31:10.843
for a dress.

31:14.949 --> 31:16.576
Do you really like the dress?

31:16.651 --> 31:18.312
Yeah. lt´s great.

31:19.754 --> 31:21.722
Forgot why l got up.

31:23.991 --> 31:26.983
-Kristy, you have to tell your mom.
-l can´t. l promised.

31:27.061 --> 31:28.790
And you cannot tell anyone.

31:28.863 --> 31:31.627
But l tell Dawn everything,
and l tell Logan even more.

31:31.699 --> 31:34.600
You can´t, Mary Anne. Not this time. Swear.

31:35.002 --> 31:36.367
All right.

31:36.971 --> 31:40.168
-But who cares if he has a job yet or not?
-Him, l guess.

31:40.241 --> 31:43.574
Can you believe he gave me a dress?
What was l supposed to say?

31:43.644 --> 31:46.306
´´Sorry, l only wear dresses
at weddings and funerals´´?

31:46.380 --> 31:48.314
-He´d think l was crazy.
-You are.

31:48.382 --> 31:49.542
l win.

31:50.384 --> 31:52.716
Your mom looks just like Jo
in Little Women.

31:52.787 --> 31:55.153
-You think so?
-Yeah. You look like him.

31:55.223 --> 31:56.815
-l do?
-A little.

31:57.558 --> 32:00.891
-What if l talk about him in my sleep?
-l´m sleeping over, remember?

32:00.962 --> 32:04.022
lf you talk, l´ll stuff a pillow in your face.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.398
You okay?

32:10.471 --> 32:12.268
Kind of freaked out.

32:18.346 --> 32:21.372
Welcome to Punch and Judy Day!

32:21.616 --> 32:24.050
Look, Mary Anne. l didn´t say yes.

32:24.118 --> 32:26.882
-But you didn´t say no.
-But l didn´t say yes.

32:26.954 --> 32:29.354
l wasn´t gonna go with Cokie.

32:29.423 --> 32:31.687
Cross your heart and hope to die?

32:44.472 --> 32:46.633
Welcome to Sports Day.

32:46.707 --> 32:50.040
Remember, only do sports
in your sports group.

32:55.082 --> 32:57.880
Okay, you know
what you´re supposed to do.

32:58.419 --> 32:59.886
l´ll distract him.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.955
Logan, l like your jeans. Nice fit.

33:10.898 --> 33:12.126
Hi, Cokie.

33:13.234 --> 33:15.759
Cokie, how are you?

33:16.203 --> 33:18.433
Your skin looks a little dry.

33:19.674 --> 33:22.837
You´re trying to insult me. How hilarious.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.116
Nice muscle.

33:32.553 --> 33:35.351
Loved your little party in Miller´s Park.

33:40.561 --> 33:43.052
-We did it.
-Great! Did you pull the tab?

33:43.397 --> 33:45.365
We didn´t pull anything.

33:45.766 --> 33:48.257
You were supposed to pull, you freak!

33:51.205 --> 33:52.832
Look what we got!

33:52.907 --> 33:53.999
Cool!

34:14.195 --> 34:15.560
You brats!

34:16.797 --> 34:20.426
-Jackie, l gotta go, okay?
-What do you mean? We gotta practice.

34:20.501 --> 34:23.163
-Sorry, Jackie. How about tomorrow?
-l guess.

34:23.237 --> 34:24.864
-Mallory.
-Yeah?

34:25.272 --> 34:27.706
-Mallory, cover for me, okay? l gotta go.
-Why?

34:27.775 --> 34:30.175
l gotta leave early. So see you.

34:31.445 --> 34:34.437
l won´t miss the next one, Jackie.
Okay? Promise.

34:37.851 --> 34:39.217
l don´t believe this.

34:39.286 --> 34:41.083
-What in the--
-Who´s that man?

34:41.155 --> 34:42.621
This is too weird.

34:42.690 --> 34:44.783
Kristy has a boyfriend?

34:44.859 --> 34:47.987
-The world must be flat.
-Who´s the guy?

34:48.661 --> 34:50.186
-No one.
-No one?

34:50.431 --> 34:52.126
Who is he, Mary Anne?

34:52.199 --> 34:54.759
l can´t tell you. l promised.

34:55.469 --> 34:58.734
Since when did we start
keeping secrets, Mary Anne?

34:59.040 --> 35:00.132
Hello?

35:01.642 --> 35:04.873
l´m Emily Haberman.
l´m your neighbor. l live next door.

35:04.945 --> 35:07.812
Hi, Mrs. Haberman.
Sometimes l see you in your garden.

35:07.882 --> 35:10.908
A little while ago, l was nearly asphyxiated...

35:10.985 --> 35:15.046
by a smelly, stinking, disgusting projectile...

35:15.122 --> 35:17.420
and l, frankly, have had enough!

35:17.491 --> 35:20.016
-lt wasn´t us.
-We didn´t know.

35:20.094 --> 35:22.028
Would you happen to know...

35:22.096 --> 35:25.793
what little buzzy insects and small children
have in common?

35:26.167 --> 35:29.068
They both have the ability
to drive a human being...

35:29.136 --> 35:32.128
who is both larger and smarter...

35:32.206 --> 35:34.299
completely out of her mind.

35:35.176 --> 35:38.111
Now, you look like decent, sensible girls...

35:38.712 --> 35:41.374
so let´s just call this a warning, shall we?

35:41.449 --> 35:44.247
-But if there´s any more trouble--
-There won´t be.

35:44.318 --> 35:46.752
You make sure there isn´t,
because if there is...

35:46.821 --> 35:49.289
l shall be forced to call the city...

35:49.356 --> 35:52.325
and speak to them
about revoking your permit.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.124
-Permit?
-Yes. Permit.

35:56.831 --> 35:59.493
-She´s a hermit?
-lsn´t that some kind of animal?

35:59.567 --> 36:01.262
Permit, you idiots!

36:06.140 --> 36:08.233
Claudia, are you studying?

36:10.945 --> 36:14.472
l was so caught up with my dad,
l wasn´t being much of a club president...

36:14.548 --> 36:16.482
and Claud was going through it, too.

36:16.550 --> 36:20.008
Besides camp, she had summer school
and l hated to admit it...

36:20.087 --> 36:22.419
but she was doing
some of my camp work, too.

36:22.490 --> 36:24.924
But somehow, and l don´t know how...

36:24.992 --> 36:28.325
she managed to come up
with a really great plan for the BSC.

36:28.863 --> 36:32.128
l think l´m having my first brilliant idea.

36:33.434 --> 36:36.130
So what do you think?
lsn´t this a cool place?

36:38.239 --> 36:40.434
lt was built in 1 767.

36:40.508 --> 36:44.069
Then later, in the 1800s,
someone turned it into a greenhouse.

36:44.145 --> 36:46.306
Did we even have a country back then?

36:46.380 --> 36:48.871
No, but we had a lot of diphtheria.

36:51.886 --> 36:55.014
l´m writing a novel
about the first nurse in America.

36:55.089 --> 36:56.181
Okay.

36:57.057 --> 36:58.922
Let´s go in, you guys.

36:59.760 --> 37:00.988
We checked into it.

37:01.061 --> 37:04.997
This place used to be an old gatehouse
before someone turned it into a greenhouse.

37:05.065 --> 37:08.330
lt´s owned by the town,
but the civic committee said if we fix it...

37:08.402 --> 37:10.495
and they approve it, we can use it.

37:10.571 --> 37:13.039
-lt´s awfully dirty.
-lt´s really cool.

37:13.407 --> 37:17.537
-l don´t know. lt seems like a lot of work.
-lt´s really hot in here.

37:17.611 --> 37:20.239
We´ve got the nebs for the grunt work.

37:20.481 --> 37:24.474
We can put the meeting table over there,
and the phone banks over there.

37:24.552 --> 37:27.544
Don´t you think this would make
an absolutely amazing office?

37:27.655 --> 37:30.283
Yeah, l do. That´s why l suggested it.

37:39.767 --> 37:41.598
No! Put that down!

37:42.536 --> 37:45.699
Anyone caught throwing food
will be sent to the time-out booth.

37:47.908 --> 37:50.399
Mallory, have you seen Dawn around?

37:50.744 --> 37:52.473
Yeah, she´s around.

37:53.214 --> 37:55.682
l repeat.: Anyone caught throwing food...

37:55.749 --> 37:58.343
will definitely be sent to the time-out booth.

37:58.819 --> 38:00.616
l didn´t do anything.

38:02.423 --> 38:05.722
All right! That´s it!
Everyone to the time-out booth!

38:06.227 --> 38:09.219
Cut it out! That´s it!
Come on! That´s enough!

38:10.998 --> 38:12.727
-l´m wiped.
-Dead.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.462
-Stace, how was your date with Luca?
-Smashing.

38:15.536 --> 38:18.869
Smashing? Did he hit you over the head
with his charm?

38:18.939 --> 38:22.534
My parents said we could use
my aunt´s cabin for Kristy´s birthday party.

38:22.610 --> 38:24.305
-Great.
-That´s perfect.

38:24.378 --> 38:28.906
Kristy, Watson told my stepdad he had some
info on the greenhouse. Did you bring it?

38:29.049 --> 38:31.745
-No, l forgot.
-Kristy, that was important.

38:31.819 --> 38:36.051
lt was all kinds of rules and stuff
we need to get it fixed up so we can use it.

38:36.123 --> 38:39.115
-How could you forget?
-That´s not like you, Kristy.

38:46.333 --> 38:49.097
-l have nothing to wear.
-What about what you´re wearing?

38:49.169 --> 38:51.831
-l hate what l´m wearing.
-You have too much to wear.

38:51.905 --> 38:53.930
-l hate the way l look.
-You look great.

38:54.008 --> 38:56.636
-Should l change my socks?
-You have to calm down.

38:56.710 --> 38:59.508
-Why is he here?
-Stacey, listen to you.

38:59.580 --> 39:01.377
-l know.
-Did you eat?

39:01.982 --> 39:03.210
l will before l go.

39:03.284 --> 39:06.651
lf you eat on schedule and give yourself
your insulin shots on time...

39:06.720 --> 39:08.381
your diabetes will not be a problem.

39:08.455 --> 39:10.355
-lf you don´t--
-l know, Mom.

39:11.158 --> 39:14.719
-l´m a little nervous about Luca, that´s all.
-Yeah. So am l.

39:18.098 --> 39:19.497
-Hi.
-Hi.

39:19.566 --> 39:20.931
Come on in.

39:21.035 --> 39:23.128
-You look smashing.
-Thanks.

39:27.141 --> 39:28.438
So do you.

39:28.509 --> 39:31.137
-l thought we´d go for a hike.
-A hike?

39:31.445 --> 39:32.707
You do hike?

39:32.780 --> 39:35.840
Hike? Sure, l do it all the time.

39:36.550 --> 39:38.017
Let me just tell my mom.

39:38.085 --> 39:40.986
-Tell me what?
-Mom, we´re going on a hike, okay? Bye.

39:41.055 --> 39:42.852
A hike? You? ln that?

39:43.724 --> 39:45.954
You must be Luca.
l´m Stacey´s mother, Maureen.

39:46.026 --> 39:47.288
Pleasure to meet you.

39:47.361 --> 39:50.296
-Okay, later, Mom.
-Wait. Did you eat something?

39:50.364 --> 39:53.128
-l grabbed a muffin.
-When did you grab a muffin?

39:53.200 --> 39:56.658
-l put it in my bag. l´ll eat in the car.
-Are you sure, Stace?

39:56.737 --> 39:58.034
Yeah, bye.

39:59.206 --> 40:01.538
-Tschûss!
-Tschûss, Mom.

40:01.842 --> 40:03.969
Wait. What does tschûss mean?

40:04.511 --> 40:05.978
l don´t know.

40:09.249 --> 40:10.978
lf we keep going, we´ll find it.

40:11.051 --> 40:12.211
Find what?

40:12.686 --> 40:13.880
Heaven.

40:15.856 --> 40:17.949
-You doing all right?
-What?

40:20.027 --> 40:21.688
-Great.
-Good.

40:22.563 --> 40:24.292
The band´s called The Dogs.

40:24.365 --> 40:26.799
We´re pretty good, if l do say so myself.

40:26.867 --> 40:28.698
l´d love to see you play.

40:28.769 --> 40:30.794
Have you ever performed here?

40:31.238 --> 40:33.706
Of course not. You´ve never been here.

40:33.774 --> 40:36.106
Stoneybrook will be our first stop.

40:37.010 --> 40:40.241
Come on.
l heard there´s a fantastic view at the top.

40:45.352 --> 40:46.580
Stacey!

40:49.022 --> 40:52.788
Luca, l need something to eat.

40:53.727 --> 40:54.819
Okay.

40:59.433 --> 41:01.628
Sorry, Claud. Can we do it tomorrow?

41:01.902 --> 41:05.030
You promised to help me study, Kristy.
What´s up with you?

41:05.339 --> 41:07.671
Sorry, Claud. l´m doing the best l can.

41:07.741 --> 41:09.265
What´s so important?

41:11.945 --> 41:14.209
lt´s David Michael´s birthday today...

41:14.281 --> 41:18.377
and l have to be with my family.
l´ll make it up to you, Claudia. l promise.

41:28.662 --> 41:32.689
Kristy, l´m going to the nursery
to pick up the rosebush. Come with me.

41:32.766 --> 41:35.428
l have to go to Claudia´s and help her study.

41:36.670 --> 41:39.366
Well, that´s on the way. l´ll drop you.

41:42.075 --> 41:43.235
l was....

41:43.310 --> 41:46.973
l don´t have to be there yet,
so l was gonna make myself a sandwich.

41:48.849 --> 41:51.613
l´ll put Emily with Nannie and l´ll join you.

41:55.389 --> 41:58.916
l was just gonna take it with me.
So l´ll see you later?

42:00.327 --> 42:02.261
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, sweetie. Love you.

42:02.329 --> 42:03.990
Love you, too. Bye, sis.

42:05.165 --> 42:07.633
l didn´t eat. That´s why l fainted.

42:08.902 --> 42:13.032
Sorry. lt´s just when my blood sugar
gets low l get kind of psycho.

42:13.340 --> 42:15.774
l wish you had told me you were diabetic.

42:15.843 --> 42:17.174
lt´s no big deal.

42:17.244 --> 42:18.871
Maybe not for you...

42:18.946 --> 42:21.938
but it makes people treat me
like l´m a little kid.

42:22.015 --> 42:23.846
My mother is so overprotective.

42:23.917 --> 42:26.886
lt makes me crazy
to worry about her worrying about me.

42:26.954 --> 42:29.752
lt´s okay. l´m just glad you feel better.

42:31.024 --> 42:34.084
l didn´t want you to think
l was sick or something, or weird.

42:34.161 --> 42:36.095
l don´t think you´re weird.

42:36.163 --> 42:38.097
l think you´re beautiful.

42:41.802 --> 42:44.703
Mom and l are so close, l hated lying to her.

42:44.771 --> 42:48.639
But l knew if l left the house in a dress,
she´d know something was up.

42:48.709 --> 42:51.735
Still, l wanted Dad to see me
in the dress he bought me...

42:51.812 --> 42:54.940
and the greenhouse
seemed the perfect place to change.

42:57.417 --> 43:01.376
lt´s 1978, Yankees versus Red Sox.

43:01.855 --> 43:04.915
-One game playoff.
-Goose Gossage pitching.

43:05.292 --> 43:07.317
Carl Yastrzemski batting.

43:07.728 --> 43:10.561
lt´s a stare-down
between Yastrzemski and Gossage.

43:11.498 --> 43:13.989
l didn´t remember
my dad being this much fun...

43:14.067 --> 43:16.399
and l wanted to see him as much as l could.

43:16.470 --> 43:18.904
We had a lot of lost time to make up for.

43:19.940 --> 43:23.376
-The Yaz hits it out of the park!
-Man! Wait a minute!

43:25.312 --> 43:28.645
-You can´t obstruct the base runner!
-ls that right? l forgot.

43:28.715 --> 43:32.708
-The Yaz hits it out of the park!
-That´s not the way it happened!

43:32.786 --> 43:35.687
-lt is this time!
-ls that right?

43:35.756 --> 43:38.190
-The Yaz hits it out of the park!
-No way.

43:44.565 --> 43:46.362
You look so grown up.

43:46.733 --> 43:48.496
l feel like a pencil.

43:48.569 --> 43:50.264
You don´t look like one.

43:51.405 --> 43:53.396
Peanut butter and banana!

43:53.907 --> 43:55.272
My favorite.

43:56.910 --> 43:58.275
l love it.

44:00.581 --> 44:03.880
You said you were gonna be hearing
about your job in a couple days.

44:03.951 --> 44:07.352
-lt´s been a few weeks. When will you know?
-Soon. Real soon.

44:07.421 --> 44:10.117
Personally, l like grapes with my meal.

44:10.490 --> 44:12.651
-You´re so silly.
-Thank you.

44:15.062 --> 44:16.222
-Dad.
-What?

44:18.632 --> 44:20.429
l´m glad you´re back.

44:20.834 --> 44:22.028
Me, too.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.203
l can´t believe this.

44:28.275 --> 44:30.072
Kristy´s never missed a meeting.

44:30.143 --> 44:31.974
-She did once.
-Her dog died.

44:32.045 --> 44:33.740
We´ve been waiting half an hour.

44:33.814 --> 44:36.840
l know l´m the alternate,
but my potassium´s down.

44:37.284 --> 44:38.945
Okay, l´ll do it.

44:41.521 --> 44:44.456
This meeting of the Baby-sitters Club
is now called to order.

44:44.524 --> 44:47.857
-Hi, guys. Sorry l´m late.
-Kristy, you´re wearing a dress.

44:47.928 --> 44:50.021
-Who died?
-Should we start?

44:50.297 --> 44:53.630
-We already have.
-New business. The Mrs. Haberman problem.

44:53.934 --> 44:55.333
Who´s Mrs. Haberman?

44:55.402 --> 44:59.736
Our neighbor who´ll report us to the city
and take away our permit for the camp.

44:59.806 --> 45:01.774
We don´t need a permit. l checked it out.

45:01.842 --> 45:04.436
lt would´ve been nice
if you were there to tell her that.

45:04.511 --> 45:07.446
-l had an appointment.
-Since when is a date an appointment?

45:07.514 --> 45:09.175
lt wasn´t a date.

45:09.249 --> 45:12.650
l said l was sorry. l´ll talk to her.
lt´s no big deal.

45:12.719 --> 45:15.586
-lt is a big deal, Kristy.
-We could lose the camp.

45:15.656 --> 45:17.783
l said l´d handle it, okay?

45:20.894 --> 45:23.988
-l gotta meet Luca.
-l gotta sit for Becca.

45:24.064 --> 45:26.828
Come on, Mary Anne,
the Newtons are coming over for dinner.

45:26.900 --> 45:28.834
l have to finish my novel.

45:47.554 --> 45:49.522
Dawn, watch this.

45:51.992 --> 45:54.586
-ls that cool?
-How´d you do that?

45:54.661 --> 45:56.561
l´ll show you sometime.

46:04.037 --> 46:05.902
They found a new home.

46:06.373 --> 46:09.240
What do you say we give them
a housewarming party?

46:09.309 --> 46:12.335
-A party?
-Why would we want to give them a party?

46:13.547 --> 46:16.380
-l´m trading you guys in.
-A party?

46:17.217 --> 46:20.812
Last night at dinner l practically
told my mom and Watson twice.

46:20.954 --> 46:23.047
l don´t know how long l can do this.

46:23.123 --> 46:25.921
How long is he gonna be ´´not here´´?

46:26.426 --> 46:27.654
l don´t know.

46:37.370 --> 46:39.031
Want some tahini?

46:39.606 --> 46:41.267
l´ll pass, thanks.

46:48.381 --> 46:51.111
-What´s up with you and Kristy?
-Nothing.

46:51.184 --> 46:53.880
Doesn´t look like nothing.
You´re always whispering.

46:53.954 --> 46:56.149
-That´s not true.
-lt is true.

46:56.857 --> 47:00.418
-Should l get my ears pierced?
-Don´t change the subject.

47:01.628 --> 47:04.028
Please don´t be mad at me, okay?

47:04.431 --> 47:07.161
Look, l´d tell you if l could. l swear.

47:07.534 --> 47:09.365
But l promised Kristy.

47:10.170 --> 47:12.070
Go be her sister then.

47:17.210 --> 47:19.735
Okay, so oxygen´s kind of white.

47:20.013 --> 47:23.312
So, it´d be in the white blood cells.
Right, Kristy?

47:24.651 --> 47:26.141
What did you say?

47:26.419 --> 47:29.354
Kristy, you know,
you´re not helping me here.

47:29.856 --> 47:31.517
l know. l just....

47:32.058 --> 47:33.650
Can we do this tomorrow?

47:33.727 --> 47:36.628
Wake up, Kristy. lf l fail,
l´m gonna have to quit the club.

47:36.696 --> 47:38.459
Maybe that´s what you want.

47:38.532 --> 47:40.796
-l´m sorry, okay?
-That´s not good enough.

47:40.867 --> 47:43.859
-She said she was sorry.
-Mary Anne, stay out of this.

47:43.937 --> 47:47.065
-l can´t do your work and my work, too.
-She said she was sorry.

47:47.140 --> 47:49.665
-l never asked you to.
-Yes, you did.

47:51.478 --> 47:53.105
Are we fighting?

47:54.114 --> 47:55.638
We never fight.

48:03.356 --> 48:05.449
-Jessi, l gotta go.
-Where?

48:06.126 --> 48:08.959
Could you just pack up
my equipment for me?

48:09.162 --> 48:10.254
Okay.

48:15.468 --> 48:18.960
l am so tired.
lf l fail my final, my life is ruined.

48:19.673 --> 48:21.197
You won´t fail.

48:22.342 --> 48:24.310
Pass the yellow paint, please.

48:24.444 --> 48:27.174
-What?
-She wants the yellow paint.

48:30.317 --> 48:33.047
Jessi, where´s Kristy?

48:34.387 --> 48:37.379
She had to leave, but can l help?

48:38.892 --> 48:42.328
Jessi, Nina Marshall can´t find Jimmy-Tony.

48:42.629 --> 48:44.859
She said you know where he is.

48:46.066 --> 48:49.900
Hi, Nina. Hi, Jimmy-Tony.

48:51.805 --> 48:54.035
Jimmy-Tony´s not there.

48:55.308 --> 48:58.209
Hold on, David Michael. l´ll be right back.

49:18.098 --> 49:20.692
-Nice dress.
-Thanks. l know an apartment you can get.

49:20.767 --> 49:23.827
-lt´s got a fireplace and l can make you chili.
-Just what l want.

49:23.904 --> 49:26.168
-That´s the only thing l know to make.
-Perfect.

49:26.239 --> 49:27.604
-You like chili?
-l love chili.

49:27.674 --> 49:30.302
Good. And you can come watch me coach.

49:30.443 --> 49:33.037
There´s this kid Jackie Rodowsky.
He´s on my team.

49:33.113 --> 49:35.013
-Jackie Rodowsky?
-Yeah.

49:35.315 --> 49:39.149
-He´s a total klutz, but he´s special.
-How´s that rocket arm of yours?

49:40.353 --> 49:42.150
Not bad. How´s yours?

49:59.539 --> 50:02.804
Kristy, would you please come in here
for a minute?

50:04.844 --> 50:05.936
What?

50:09.049 --> 50:10.573
Where were you?

50:11.318 --> 50:14.116
l had to pick up some stuff for the camp.

50:14.454 --> 50:17.446
You forgot to pick up
something pretty important.

50:17.524 --> 50:18.855
Like what?

50:19.459 --> 50:21.120
Like your brother.

50:23.930 --> 50:25.295
ls he okay?

50:26.599 --> 50:28.829
He tried to come home by himself.

50:28.902 --> 50:31.496
l don´t want to think
about what would´ve happened...

50:31.571 --> 50:34.131
if Mr. Kishi hadn´t found him
and brought him home.

50:34.207 --> 50:36.072
Mom, l´m really sorry.

50:38.611 --> 50:41.375
l can´t believe you let this happen.
What were you thinking?

50:41.448 --> 50:44.884
David Michael´s only seven.
What if something had happened to him?

50:44.951 --> 50:47.044
He knows his way.
Nothing would´ve happened.

50:47.120 --> 50:49.918
-How do you know?
-lt was a mistake, okay?

50:50.123 --> 50:53.058
You can´t make mistakes like that,
not with children.

50:53.126 --> 50:56.857
-Especially with your younger brother.
-But David Michael´s fine.

50:56.930 --> 51:00.297
-He might not have been fine.
-l get the point, okay?

51:02.102 --> 51:04.900
lt´s not like you to be so irresponsible.

51:05.572 --> 51:07.938
l don´t understand.
What has gotten into you lately?

51:08.008 --> 51:11.000
Yeah, you don´t understand.
You wouldn´t understand!

51:11.077 --> 51:13.204
Understand what? What don´t l understand?

51:13.279 --> 51:15.611
-Leave me alone!
-What don´t l understand?

51:15.682 --> 51:18.048
l´m not gonna leave you alone.
l am your father.

51:18.118 --> 51:21.212
-l want to know what´s going on.
-You´re not my father!

51:31.831 --> 51:35.733
l felt horrible about David Michael
and what l said to Watson.

51:35.869 --> 51:39.430
And l knew if Claud didn´t pass
it´d be mostly my fault.

51:48.214 --> 51:50.148
l saw a tree eat a dog.

51:50.483 --> 51:53.043
-What kind of dog?
-A green one.

51:53.787 --> 51:56.312
-Excuse me.
-l once ate an anthill.

51:56.389 --> 51:58.220
Did you get bad breath?

52:00.126 --> 52:01.889
You look very pretty today.

52:01.961 --> 52:04.759
And l love what you´re doing
for the environment.

52:04.964 --> 52:06.556
Thank you, Alan.

52:07.267 --> 52:10.896
Yeah. lt makes me wanna fly.

52:26.052 --> 52:28.316
lt´s cool your folks are letting us
use the cabin.

52:28.388 --> 52:30.913
My mom´s gonna drive us out,
and she promised...

52:30.990 --> 52:33.083
she´d keep my brothers out of our way.

52:33.159 --> 52:35.218
Kristy is gonna have the best birthday.

52:35.295 --> 52:38.321
-l don´t know if she deserves it.
-Believe me, she deserves it.

52:38.398 --> 52:39.626
She´s coming.

52:41.901 --> 52:44.335
Guys, Luca asked me
to go to New York with him.

52:44.404 --> 52:46.565
-No way!
-Are you gonna go?

52:46.639 --> 52:50.234
l don´t know. lf my mom says
it´s okay with my dad, she might let me...

52:50.310 --> 52:51.675
if Claudia comes.

52:51.744 --> 52:54.110
Me? l can´t. l have to study.

52:54.180 --> 52:56.114
lt´s not till after your test.

52:57.317 --> 53:00.775
Today, using the BSC quick-study method...

53:00.954 --> 53:03.047
you´re gonna learn about the human body!

53:03.123 --> 53:07.219
-Don´t bother. lt doesn´t interest me.
-Does the Baby-sitters Club interest you?

53:07.293 --> 53:09.784
-lt´s my life.
-Then get interested.

53:10.797 --> 53:14.528
Claud didn´t know that we had come up
with a BSC emergency plan...

53:14.601 --> 53:17.434
that would make it impossible for her to fail.

53:23.009 --> 53:25.375
lf you wanna run, if you wanna jump

53:25.445 --> 53:27.936
You gotta get your left
and right ventricles to pump

53:28.014 --> 53:30.039
Through the heart, the center of it all

53:30.116 --> 53:31.242
-Surprised?
-Yep.

53:31.317 --> 53:32.682
And you might just fall

53:32.752 --> 53:35.186
Down to the ground
which will cause you pain

53:35.255 --> 53:37.519
But that´ll never happen
if you use your brain

53:37.590 --> 53:40.150
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain

53:40.226 --> 53:42.717
That´ll never happen if you use your brain

53:47.233 --> 53:49.724
Neurons run through the cortex
into the frontal lobe

53:49.802 --> 53:51.997
Past the hypothalamus, it´s good to go

53:52.071 --> 53:54.699
lnto the cerebellum
it´s the best thing that could happen

53:54.774 --> 53:57.368
´Cause we´re the baby-sitters
and we´ll always be rappin´

53:57.443 --> 53:59.274
And singing and thinking is the best

53:59.345 --> 54:01.905
Now you better go and study
so you pass your science test

54:01.981 --> 54:05.439
Now you better go and study
so you pass your science test

54:08.888 --> 54:11.322
lf you do your homework
you can almost feel it

54:11.391 --> 54:13.723
Pumping to the brain, pumping to the brain

54:13.793 --> 54:15.920
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain

54:15.995 --> 54:18.156
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain

54:18.231 --> 54:20.665
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain

54:20.733 --> 54:23.429
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain

54:23.503 --> 54:26.131
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain

54:26.606 --> 54:29.734
-You guys. All your lucky stuff.
-We hope they help.

54:29.809 --> 54:31.902
Here, Claud. They´re my lucky shoelaces.

54:31.978 --> 54:34.811
l was wearing them
when l got my first home run.

54:36.583 --> 54:37.948
Thanks, guys.

54:38.017 --> 54:41.453
-l could use all the help l can get.
-We´re with you, Claud.

55:22.996 --> 55:26.159
The neurons run through the cortex
into the frontal lobe

55:26.232 --> 55:30.464
-Past the hypothalamus it´s good to go
-´´lt´s good to go, into the cerebellum....´´

55:30.536 --> 55:33.937
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain

55:45.952 --> 55:47.510
-Hey, Claud.
-Hi, Kristy.

55:47.587 --> 55:49.987
-How´d the test go?
-l think okay.

55:51.557 --> 55:53.923
That´s great. So what are you doing?

55:53.993 --> 55:56.427
Stacey´s mom is here
and we may go to New York.

55:56.496 --> 55:58.157
So l can´t talk. Bye.

56:06.572 --> 56:08.437
-Hello?
-Mary Anne?

56:09.175 --> 56:10.403
Kristy, what´s up?

56:10.877 --> 56:14.313
Nothing. l just talked to Claudia.
She sounded kind of weird.

56:15.181 --> 56:16.239
Are you okay?

56:16.849 --> 56:18.612
Yeah. No.

56:20.119 --> 56:23.179
All this sneaking around,
l just feel like a rat.

56:23.356 --> 56:24.345
So do l.

56:24.757 --> 56:28.955
They´re ganging up on me, too.
Dawn´s practically not even talking to me.

56:29.962 --> 56:31.657
l don´t know what to do.

56:31.798 --> 56:34.767
lf l tell the truth,
l´ll betray my dad, lf l don´t...

56:34.834 --> 56:36.859
l´m lying to my mom and all my friends.

56:37.203 --> 56:39.194
You´ve already done that.

56:39.439 --> 56:41.566
And you got me doing it, too.

56:42.041 --> 56:43.201
Call you later.

56:44.610 --> 56:48.478
Kristy, look at Nannie´s tomatoes.
They´re huge.

56:49.082 --> 56:51.050
This year she´s singing them show tunes.

56:51.117 --> 56:54.518
They´re a lot bigger than that year
she was singing them torch songs.

56:54.587 --> 56:57.215
-Wanna try one?
-No, thanks.

56:58.658 --> 57:00.990
You don´t know what you´re missing.

57:06.632 --> 57:08.361
-Mom?
-Yes, sweetie.

57:08.434 --> 57:09.458
l....

57:19.445 --> 57:22.175
You have a piece of tomato on your chin.

57:28.588 --> 57:30.180
Good night, Mom.

57:48.040 --> 57:50.770
-Do you want one?
-Why don´t you keep it?

57:54.680 --> 57:56.147
Can you pass the mustard?

57:56.215 --> 57:58.410
-What?
-She wants the mustard.

58:03.456 --> 58:06.983
-Kristy, l hit one yesterday.
-Jackie, that´s incredible.

58:07.360 --> 58:09.157
Well, l kind of hit it.

58:09.295 --> 58:11.525
Hit my bat, then kind of fell off.

58:11.597 --> 58:15.328
Probably the closest one to a home run
l´m ever gonna hit in my life.

58:16.335 --> 58:18.200
And you didn´t see it.

58:18.638 --> 58:22.631
Jackie, you´re gonna hit more.
All you needed was one to break the ice.

58:23.042 --> 58:24.031
Yeah.

58:27.380 --> 58:29.314
You really let him down, Kristy.

58:29.382 --> 58:31.748
-Give it a rest, Claud.
-No, Claud´s right.

58:31.818 --> 58:35.652
-What is up with you, Kristy?
-You´re always leaving so early.

58:35.788 --> 58:37.346
You´re acting so weird.

58:37.423 --> 58:39.584
-You´re always late.
-Yeah.

58:39.659 --> 58:42.594
-You have a responsibility here.
-You owe us.

58:44.430 --> 58:47.490
-l can´t tell you.
-But you can tell Mary Anne.

58:51.504 --> 58:53.301
She´s my best friend.

59:10.256 --> 59:12.622
Everything´s gonna be okay, sweetie.

59:12.692 --> 59:15.388
You just hang in there.
What are you thinking?

59:15.461 --> 59:17.452
-lt´s hard.
-Yeah, l know.

59:17.997 --> 59:21.364
Claudia flunked a quiz,
and l was supposed to help her.

59:21.434 --> 59:24.995
That was a while ago, wasn´t it?
You did everything you could do.

59:25.404 --> 59:27.634
You talking to your boyfriend?

59:27.707 --> 59:30.267
David Michael, leave your sister alone.

59:31.744 --> 59:35.145
-There´s just a lot going on here.
-You want to change phones?

59:35.448 --> 59:37.541
-l´ll call you later.
-0kay.

59:41.420 --> 59:43.411
-You okay?
-Yeah, fine.

59:44.490 --> 59:47.118
-You sure? Who were you talking to?
-Nobody.

59:48.794 --> 59:50.557
Seem a little upset.

59:50.663 --> 59:52.631
l have an allergy, okay?

59:55.067 --> 59:56.830
What´s wrong? Are you crying?

59:56.903 --> 01:00:00.361
Can´t you just leave me alone?
l have an allergy, okay?

01:00:01.974 --> 01:00:04.408
-What are you allergic to?
-Summer.

01:00:07.113 --> 01:00:10.378
Remember when l took you to Monty´s?
You wouldn´t get off The Monster?

01:00:10.449 --> 01:00:13.384
The only 5-year-old that
wouldn´t get off the Ferris wheel.

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:18.316
How about for your birthday we go back
and ride The Monster till we puke?

01:00:19.158 --> 01:00:20.489
Hi, Meggy!

01:00:23.729 --> 01:00:25.219
How about a box seat?

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:29.726
Dad, why´d you come back
if you´re just gonna hide?

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:31.826
To see you. l missed you.

01:00:32.538 --> 01:00:36.269
But, Dad, you could´ve come before.
Nothing was stopping you.

01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:40.139
l tried.

01:00:40.913 --> 01:00:44.542
Dad, you sent two cards
in five years or something.

01:00:45.117 --> 01:00:47.176
l was always thinking you´d come.

01:00:47.253 --> 01:00:49.517
You never did. Ever.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:55.122
l´d wait for you every year.
You never even called.

01:00:56.596 --> 01:01:00.532
You don´t care about me and everyone
who does care about me is mad at me!

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.560
l can´t do this anymore!
l´ve never lied to Mom or my friends.

01:01:04.637 --> 01:01:08.232
And since you got here,
that´s all l´ve been doing and l hate it!

01:01:08.574 --> 01:01:10.371
lt´s all your fault!

01:01:11.243 --> 01:01:13.541
l´m gonna tell Mom you´re here.

01:01:14.413 --> 01:01:15.675
Kristy, we had a deal.

01:01:15.748 --> 01:01:19.479
Dad, l´m breaking it,
just like you broke all your promises.

01:01:19.785 --> 01:01:21.275
l´m here, aren´t l?

01:01:26.826 --> 01:01:27.918
Look....

01:01:29.128 --> 01:01:32.495
l´m sorry, okay?
l know l haven´t been there for you.

01:01:35.468 --> 01:01:37.868
l know there´s nothing l can do
about the past.

01:01:37.937 --> 01:01:41.532
But there is something l can do
about right now, about you and me.

01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:43.372
Come here.

01:01:46.846 --> 01:01:48.336
Tell you what.

01:01:48.581 --> 01:01:52.381
On your birthday, when l take you
to Monty´s, l´ll pick you up at home...

01:01:52.451 --> 01:01:55.887
and we´ll tell everybody
the good news together. Okay?

01:01:56.522 --> 01:01:58.717
-Really?
-l promise.

01:02:00.326 --> 01:02:02.817
That´s the best present
you could ever give me.

01:02:02.895 --> 01:02:04.487
Wait a minute.

01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:06.320
l need a real hug.

01:02:33.559 --> 01:02:37.051
-Dawn, you okay today?
-Yeah. Why wouldn´t l be?

01:02:37.763 --> 01:02:39.594
l don´t know. Why wouldn´t you be?

01:02:39.665 --> 01:02:43.658
Okay, the place has to be squeaky clean
for the civic committee on Monday.

01:02:45.037 --> 01:02:47.835
You´re driving out with us
for your party, right?

01:02:49.241 --> 01:02:51.641
l´m gonna be a little late, but l´ll be there.

01:02:51.711 --> 01:02:54.305
-l have my own ride. Okay?
-Okay.

01:02:55.681 --> 01:02:57.649
l can´t breathe in here.

01:02:58.317 --> 01:03:01.650
Why aren´t any of the windows open?
My hair is drooping.

01:03:01.721 --> 01:03:04.417
l need some air. l need some hairspray.

01:03:05.558 --> 01:03:08.493
My gosh, it´s Claudia. l hope she passed.

01:03:08.661 --> 01:03:11.892
-Did we flunk?
-This could be the worst day of our lives.

01:03:13.199 --> 01:03:16.327
l got a B minus.
Can you believe it? l passed!

01:03:21.474 --> 01:03:23.135
Look out, New York!

01:03:34.286 --> 01:03:36.254
Stace and Claud stayed at Stacey´s dad´s...

01:03:36.322 --> 01:03:40.053
and the next day, he took them everywhere.
He showed them Central Park...

01:03:40.126 --> 01:03:43.186
The Plaza hotel, Rockefeller Center...

01:03:43.796 --> 01:03:47.493
and then the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
for Claud.

01:03:49.969 --> 01:03:52.767
That night, he dropped them off
at a teen club downtown...

01:03:52.838 --> 01:03:54.806
to meet Luca and his friends.

01:03:54.874 --> 01:03:57.240
That was after
he gave Luca the third degree...

01:03:57.309 --> 01:03:59.209
about where they´d go and what they´d do.

01:03:59.278 --> 01:04:01.007
Okay, have fun. lDs.

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:02.646
Damn cool place.

01:04:05.818 --> 01:04:07.410
All right, boss.

01:04:08.187 --> 01:04:09.518
All right.

01:04:10.089 --> 01:04:11.852
Okay. Ladies, lDs.

01:04:12.858 --> 01:04:15.122
l must´ve left it in my other wallet.

01:04:15.561 --> 01:04:16.721
Sorry.

01:04:16.796 --> 01:04:20.095
Come on, give her a break.
She´s 16. They both are.

01:04:20.166 --> 01:04:22.157
l can´t let them in without lDs.

01:04:22.968 --> 01:04:24.799
lt´s right here.

01:04:26.772 --> 01:04:28.637
Sorry, babe. Nice try.

01:04:29.542 --> 01:04:32.875
-She just showed you her lD.
-Yeah, and she ain´t no 16.

01:04:32.978 --> 01:04:34.878
-So beat it.
-l´m almost...

01:04:36.515 --> 01:04:37.743
sixteen.

01:04:39.852 --> 01:04:41.717
Give this back to your girlfriend.

01:04:41.787 --> 01:04:43.721
Get your lDs ready.

01:04:45.057 --> 01:04:46.285
Damn it!

01:04:47.726 --> 01:04:49.091
Thirteen?

01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:53.424
-Can you stop saying that?
-l just can´t believe you´re only 13!

01:04:53.499 --> 01:04:56.161
-Stop screaming in my ear.
-Stop screaming in my ear.

01:04:56.235 --> 01:04:58.294
-You stay out of this!
-Don´t yell at her!

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:01.635
-My husband and l, we were engaged at 13.
-Stay out of this!

01:05:01.707 --> 01:05:04.505
Don´t yell at her!
Can you let me out of here? Please.

01:05:04.577 --> 01:05:08.308
-Don´t listen to her. She´s a child.
-Let me out of this cab!

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.577
-l´m not about to let two little girls--
-Shut up!

01:05:13.252 --> 01:05:16.312
You know, l thought
maybe you weren´t quite 16.

01:05:16.722 --> 01:05:19.589
l never imagined you were only 13.

01:05:20.259 --> 01:05:22.591
-Thirteen!
-l wanna get out now!

01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:25.630
Forget it. l promised your father
l´d take you home.

01:05:27.666 --> 01:05:29.327
Thirteen.

01:06:02.101 --> 01:06:03.261
Sorry.

01:06:22.888 --> 01:06:25.413
The whole thing with Luca was a disaster.

01:06:25.491 --> 01:06:27.755
We all felt so bad for Stace.

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.494
They say things usually look better
in the morning...

01:06:30.562 --> 01:06:32.798
which is good, because we still
had three-and-a-half weeks of camp.

01:06:32.798 --> 01:06:33.765
which is good, because we still
had three-and-a-half weeks of camp.

01:06:33.832 --> 01:06:36.392
Flowers and dirt never make you hurt.

01:06:36.468 --> 01:06:39.062
Vanessa, my parents came from a bear.

01:06:39.171 --> 01:06:42.504
-What kind of bear?
-Alligators like to fly.

01:06:43.809 --> 01:06:45.299
Where´d you get these?

01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:47.470
-We picked them.
-From where?

01:06:50.149 --> 01:06:53.778
-Oh, no! My Antirrhinum majus!
-Your what?

01:06:54.353 --> 01:06:58.255
-My snapdragons!
-Mrs. Haberman, please calm down.

01:06:58.324 --> 01:06:59.723
Calm down?

01:07:00.359 --> 01:07:03.726
These aberrations that you call children...

01:07:04.363 --> 01:07:06.831
have beheaded my precious flowers...

01:07:06.899 --> 01:07:09.697
as though they´re nothing
more than cauliflower!

01:07:09.802 --> 01:07:12.566
-We´ll replace them. l promise.
-Replace them?

01:07:13.138 --> 01:07:14.935
You don´t understand.

01:07:15.207 --> 01:07:17.641
They´re completely traumatized.

01:07:18.277 --> 01:07:20.905
l grew these little babies from seeds.

01:07:22.715 --> 01:07:24.683
All right, l warned you.

01:07:25.918 --> 01:07:27.715
l´m calling the city.

01:07:27.987 --> 01:07:29.318
No! Wait!

01:07:30.856 --> 01:07:34.792
Alan, can you look after my group
for a few minutes?

01:07:34.927 --> 01:07:36.258
This Alan?

01:07:36.528 --> 01:07:37.790
Mrs. Haberman!

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.093
l´m really sorry, Mrs. Haberman.

01:07:43.168 --> 01:07:46.399
l´ve grown these since spring.
They´re only herbs: sage and rosemary.

01:07:46.472 --> 01:07:49.999
They won´t make up for what happened
or replace your beautiful flowers.

01:07:50.075 --> 01:07:52.407
But they´re delicious,
and they smell so nice...

01:07:52.478 --> 01:07:55.242
and l would really like you to have them.

01:07:55.614 --> 01:07:57.605
You´re right. They don´t.

01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:01.417
l planted those flowers
especially for the butterflies...

01:08:01.487 --> 01:08:03.352
and the hummingbirds.

01:08:03.922 --> 01:08:06.322
l think hummingbirds are magical.

01:08:06.558 --> 01:08:08.753
They look like little jewels.

01:08:08.994 --> 01:08:11.326
-What´s your name again?
-Dawn.

01:08:11.964 --> 01:08:14.296
Dawn. How ´60s.

01:08:15.467 --> 01:08:19.233
l do appreciate the gesture, Dawn.
Thank you very much.

01:08:19.938 --> 01:08:22.930
l was just gonna have some tea.
You want some?

01:08:23.341 --> 01:08:25.242
-Sure. Thanks.
-Come on.

01:08:25.644 --> 01:08:27.407
You know, l´m really sorry about that.

01:08:35.787 --> 01:08:38.086
ls that you in those pictures?

01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:41.283
That one´s in Vietnam. This was Berlin.

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.953
l happened to be there
the night the wall came down.

01:08:44.029 --> 01:08:46.224
That´s Africa. l was on safari.

01:08:46.298 --> 01:08:49.859
l had the most amazing conversation
with that water buffalo.

01:08:51.437 --> 01:08:53.997
-ls herbal all right for you?
-Sure.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.438
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:03.542
Oat straw. l used to drink this with my dad.

01:09:03.615 --> 01:09:04.707
Really?

01:09:04.783 --> 01:09:07.809
He´s still in California.
That´s where l grew up.

01:09:07.886 --> 01:09:09.251
California.

01:09:10.154 --> 01:09:13.750
They have some exquisite
ruby-crowned kinglets there.

01:09:15.727 --> 01:09:18.218
That is if the pollution hasn´t killed them all.

01:09:18.296 --> 01:09:21.130
lt was still pretty nice when l was there.

01:09:21.233 --> 01:09:24.634
l used to sit at the bottom
of this redwood tree all the time.

01:09:24.703 --> 01:09:26.102
And do what?

01:09:26.805 --> 01:09:28.033
Nothing.

01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:34.868
Yes. Quiet can be a lovely companion.

01:09:37.515 --> 01:09:39.643
One that l´ve missed lately.

01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:46.787
Dawn, you´re almost delightful.

01:09:47.259 --> 01:09:48.590
Thank you.

01:09:49.461 --> 01:09:51.929
But l don´t know
how much more l can stand.

01:09:52.197 --> 01:09:54.825
Please, it´s only for a few more days.

01:09:55.501 --> 01:09:57.901
How many days is a few more days?

01:09:58.804 --> 01:09:59.828
Several.

01:10:01.006 --> 01:10:03.702
And is several more or less than a few?

01:10:06.378 --> 01:10:07.777
l don´t know.

01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:10.312
Well, then l don´t know either.

01:10:29.835 --> 01:10:33.430
-Honey, Luca´s outside.
-Tell him l´m not here.

01:10:36.608 --> 01:10:39.805
You´ll feel a lot better if you go out there
and talk to him.

01:10:39.878 --> 01:10:41.038
No, l won´t.

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:45.514
He´s called six times. The least
you could do is hear what he has to say.

01:10:49.388 --> 01:10:51.686
He´s pretty good on that thing.

01:10:56.828 --> 01:11:00.889
-You´re trying too hard to impress her.
-But that´s what you told me to do.

01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:02.934
Well, don´t try so hard.

01:11:03.068 --> 01:11:06.299
But you said before,
´´Whatever you do, don´t be yourself.´´

01:11:07.806 --> 01:11:11.606
You think if you were yourself
she´d like you?

01:11:12.544 --> 01:11:14.011
l don´t know.

01:11:19.952 --> 01:11:22.477
Shut the door on your way out, okay?

01:11:23.388 --> 01:11:25.151
Nice work, you guys.

01:11:27.159 --> 01:11:30.424
She likes me. Yeah, she really likes me.

01:11:31.563 --> 01:11:32.655
Okay.

01:11:50.849 --> 01:11:52.544
-Looks great.
-Thanks.

01:11:52.618 --> 01:11:54.347
-Almost done.
-Cool.

01:11:56.388 --> 01:11:58.822
-Mary Anne. Can l put this here?
-Sure.

01:12:00.325 --> 01:12:02.555
-What do you think?
-Perfect.

01:12:03.428 --> 01:12:05.191
-Strathmore lnn.
-Hi.

01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:07.229
Yeah. Patrick Thomas, please.

01:12:07.366 --> 01:12:08.731
0ne moment.

01:12:10.035 --> 01:12:11.525
Hey, birthday girl.

01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:15.039
-What time are they picking you up?
-Soon.

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:18.437
-Sorry, he´s checked out.
-Wish l was going to the lake.

01:12:20.112 --> 01:12:23.206
-Did he leave a note or....
-There´s nothing here.

01:12:24.182 --> 01:12:25.649
Would you check again, please?

01:12:25.717 --> 01:12:28.345
l just came on duty and l don´t see anything.

01:12:28.954 --> 01:12:32.355
He was supposed to pick me up,
but l must´ve gotten it wrong.

01:12:32.457 --> 01:12:34.982
-Maybe l was supposed to meet him.
-0kay.

01:12:35.227 --> 01:12:36.956
-Okay, thanks.
-Bye.

01:13:32.117 --> 01:13:35.746
-She´ll be here any minute.
-She´s been late all summer.

01:13:37.089 --> 01:13:39.057
Why is the cake melting?

01:13:43.495 --> 01:13:45.690
Who bought an ice-cream cake?

01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:08.248
Ladies, we can do some major damage here.

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:12.285
Wait until the civic committee
gets a load of this.

01:14:15.761 --> 01:14:18.696
Okay. There´s more shaving cream
in the bag.

01:14:19.765 --> 01:14:21.392
Hand me a can!

01:14:23.602 --> 01:14:25.331
l can´t. l´m stuck.

01:14:26.138 --> 01:14:27.298
Me, too.

01:14:27.372 --> 01:14:30.307
Yeah, right. Like this is really wet cement.

01:14:31.476 --> 01:14:33.671
Kind of looks that way to me.

01:14:42.754 --> 01:14:44.312
Your attention, folks.

01:14:44.389 --> 01:14:48.450
Due to the storm,
Monty´s Fun City is now closing.

01:14:50.962 --> 01:14:52.930
Dad? Daddy?

01:14:54.266 --> 01:14:55.528
You okay?

01:14:59.771 --> 01:15:02.831
Monty´s Fun City is now closing.

01:15:03.408 --> 01:15:05.899
We are sorry for the inconvenience.

01:15:31.436 --> 01:15:33.495
-Good night, Mike.
-See you.

01:15:36.041 --> 01:15:37.941
-Mallory?
-Kristy!

01:15:38.009 --> 01:15:41.001
-Mallory, l´m at--
-Kristy? Hello?

01:15:41.379 --> 01:15:42.539
Hello?

01:15:49.688 --> 01:15:50.882
We got cut off.

01:15:50.956 --> 01:15:52.856
-Where is she?
-l don´t know.

01:15:55.494 --> 01:15:58.486
-l promised.
-Something horrible could´ve happened.

01:15:58.563 --> 01:16:00.326
We have to find her.

01:16:04.369 --> 01:16:06.269
Kristy´s dad came back.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.307
Her real dad.

01:16:14.579 --> 01:16:16.740
-We have to call her mom.
-No.

01:16:17.482 --> 01:16:21.543
-Kristy made me swear. We can´t tell anyone.
-We can´t just sit here.

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.088
-When are your parents getting home?
-Late.

01:16:25.323 --> 01:16:27.416
We need a car to get there.

01:16:27.692 --> 01:16:29.592
l think l know someone.

01:16:32.998 --> 01:16:34.226
Mister!

01:17:11.169 --> 01:17:15.105
-Kristy, are you okay?
-We´ve been looking everywhere for you!

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:17.069
We were so worried!

01:17:22.447 --> 01:17:23.641
Thanks.

01:17:34.526 --> 01:17:37.222
Come on, Kristy. We gotta get you warm.

01:17:38.496 --> 01:17:39.861
l´m soaked.

01:17:44.669 --> 01:17:47.069
Luca, l know l´ve been a real nightmare...

01:17:47.138 --> 01:17:49.663
and you can´t wait to be with your friends.

01:17:50.075 --> 01:17:52.805
Sometimes l don´t know how to be myself.

01:17:53.345 --> 01:17:55.779
-l never met anyone like you.
-Are you finished?

01:17:55.847 --> 01:17:57.872
And l wanted to get to know you.

01:17:59.684 --> 01:18:01.879
l haven´t told you something.

01:18:02.554 --> 01:18:04.681
l´m coming back next summer.

01:18:04.823 --> 01:18:06.347
-You are?
-Yeah.

01:18:07.592 --> 01:18:10.186
-l´ll be 1 4.
-l know.

01:18:22.941 --> 01:18:23.999
Bye.

01:18:40.258 --> 01:18:41.748
Life´s a joke.

01:18:43.395 --> 01:18:48.025
l remember last year when my grandma died,
l stayed in my room and cried for two days.

01:18:48.099 --> 01:18:50.226
l didn´t think l´d ever feel good again.

01:18:50.301 --> 01:18:53.293
l felt the same way
when my mom and dad split up.

01:18:54.773 --> 01:18:57.936
Me, too. lt´s the worst.

01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:01.773
l feel so stupid.
l really believed him this time.

01:19:03.515 --> 01:19:05.642
lt´s not your fault, Kristy.

01:19:06.918 --> 01:19:09.751
But l thought l was more important to him.

01:19:09.988 --> 01:19:11.888
You´re important to us.

01:19:12.857 --> 01:19:15.018
l screwed up your whole summer.

01:19:15.293 --> 01:19:17.784
Okay, so this summer was your turn.

01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:22.258
l can´t believe you guys
are still talking to me.

01:19:22.434 --> 01:19:24.561
Are you still talking to me?

01:19:25.870 --> 01:19:29.533
Only if l can borrow your plaid jacket
for the rest of the year.

01:19:29.641 --> 01:19:32.667
-Deal.
-l wouldn´t have yelled at you if l´d known.

01:19:33.712 --> 01:19:35.441
Yeah, you would´ve.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.212
Okay, l guess l would´ve.

01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:40.749
Make a wish.

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.422
Friends forever.

01:19:59.104 --> 01:20:00.401
You guys.

01:20:02.841 --> 01:20:05.275
What kind of cake is this, anyway?

01:20:09.013 --> 01:20:10.275
You guys.

01:20:14.619 --> 01:20:18.055
l can´t believe he was here for over a month
and you never told me.

01:20:18.123 --> 01:20:20.921
You think l liked not telling you?
lt was really hard.

01:20:20.992 --> 01:20:25.088
Well, l´m sure it was hard,
but that doesn´t make it right to lie.

01:20:25.163 --> 01:20:28.360
-He made me promise.
-He shouldn´t have done that.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:31.797
But he said on my birthday
we were going to tell you.

01:20:32.237 --> 01:20:35.172
l could wring his neck for doing this to you.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:38.004
Maybe if l´d been different,
he wouldn´t have done it.

01:20:38.076 --> 01:20:41.170
No, you´re not supposed
to be the grownup here.

01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:46.041
Your father says he´s gonna do
a lot of things that he doesn´t do.

01:20:46.718 --> 01:20:48.481
Why is he like that?

01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:51.684
Honey, l don´t know.

01:20:52.757 --> 01:20:54.486
l believed him, too.

01:20:54.959 --> 01:20:58.360
l´m glad we got to spend time together.
He made me laugh.

01:20:58.930 --> 01:21:00.124
l know.

01:21:00.765 --> 01:21:03.962
That´s one of the most wonderful things
about him.

01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:06.569
He loves you, you know.

01:21:06.805 --> 01:21:09.797
But not the way
you and Watson love me, right?

01:21:12.343 --> 01:21:14.675
This was in the mailbox for you.

01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:20.442
Wait.

01:21:23.621 --> 01:21:26.920
´´Dear Kristy,
l want to tell you this in person...

01:21:27.192 --> 01:21:30.252
´´but l don´t have the heart
or the guts, l guess.

01:21:30.361 --> 01:21:34.161
´´The job didn´t work out.
Can you believe it? After all that.

01:21:34.532 --> 01:21:38.366
´´Hope your birthday´s great.
Remember, l owe you a ride on The Monster.

01:21:38.436 --> 01:21:39.562
´´Love, Dad.

01:21:39.771 --> 01:21:42.331
´´PS: Seeing you meant everything to me.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:46.069
´´l´m so sorry l let you down
and put you in a tough spot with your mom.

01:21:46.144 --> 01:21:47.839
´´l´ll never do it again.

01:21:48.012 --> 01:21:50.105
´´l´m on my way to Colorado.

01:21:50.215 --> 01:21:54.811
´´Chris Almond told me there´s an opening
for a stringer on the paper there.´´

01:21:55.753 --> 01:21:58.187
Great, Dad. Colorado. What´s next?

01:22:00.758 --> 01:22:03.022
Your father is full of dreams.

01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:05.618
Just like you.

01:22:08.733 --> 01:22:10.701
Don´t ever give them up.

01:22:16.541 --> 01:22:17.872
What happened?

01:22:18.042 --> 01:22:19.236
No!

01:22:19.377 --> 01:22:21.971
-What´s happening here?
-What´s going on?

01:22:25.817 --> 01:22:28.877
-What did they do to this place?
-What happened, Kristy?

01:22:28.953 --> 01:22:31.217
The civic committee is coming today.

01:22:31.356 --> 01:22:33.119
What are we gonna do?

01:22:33.191 --> 01:22:35.250
-We´re dead meat.
-My flowers!

01:22:35.326 --> 01:22:37.157
What´d they do to my paints?

01:22:37.228 --> 01:22:39.890
-Look at this mess.
-l can´t believe this.

01:22:39.964 --> 01:22:42.558
-Look at this place.
-lt´s disgusting.

01:22:43.534 --> 01:22:45.001
Don´t be sad.

01:22:48.406 --> 01:22:50.169
You guys! Look!

01:22:52.944 --> 01:22:55.208
lt´s like that thing in Hollywood.

01:22:55.313 --> 01:22:56.678
She melted.

01:22:56.881 --> 01:22:59.816
That girl is building up
some very bad karma.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.852
The civic committee
was coming in two hours.

01:23:04.923 --> 01:23:07.483
Cokie had really creamed us this time.

01:23:07.592 --> 01:23:10.823
Then Claud, using a very brilliant
scientific method...

01:23:10.895 --> 01:23:14.126
figured out that shaving cream
and toilet paper clean pretty well.

01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:15.961
This time we did all the grunt work.

01:23:16.034 --> 01:23:20.300
And with the help of the kids,
we got that place cleaned up in record time.

01:23:21.739 --> 01:23:24.833
And best of all,
Claud and l were friends again.

01:23:33.551 --> 01:23:35.246
l don´t believe this.

01:23:35.353 --> 01:23:38.652
They saw a problem,
and they worked hard to solve it.

01:23:38.756 --> 01:23:41.316
What are you saying?
Being good gets you somewhere?

01:23:41.392 --> 01:23:44.759
Being bad didn´t.
l mean, we wasted our whole summer.

01:23:45.396 --> 01:23:48.024
You didn´t waste it. You were with me.

01:23:48.566 --> 01:23:50.363
You got an education.

01:23:53.037 --> 01:23:54.095
Ready?

01:23:54.172 --> 01:23:57.903
The civic committee showed up.
Just our luck, right on time.

01:23:58.209 --> 01:23:59.540
Did they say anything?

01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:02.340
-You´ve shown a lot of civic pride.
-Yes.

01:24:02.647 --> 01:24:06.378
And we would love to grant your request
to use the structure.

01:24:06.784 --> 01:24:08.115
We´ve done it!

01:24:09.053 --> 01:24:11.453
But l´m afraid it´s not possible.

01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:15.359
-Why?
-You charge for your services, don´t you?

01:24:15.426 --> 01:24:16.552
Definitely.

01:24:16.627 --> 01:24:19.926
Then you consider yourself
more a business than a club.

01:24:20.031 --> 01:24:21.157
Absolutely.

01:24:21.332 --> 01:24:25.132
-And your business makes you money?
-What good business doesn´t?

01:24:25.203 --> 01:24:27.171
l believe we have a problem.

01:24:27.572 --> 01:24:30.905
Our charter states that any facility....

01:24:31.976 --> 01:24:34.638
Bird Face is on the committee? We´re dead.

01:24:35.346 --> 01:24:39.214
They wanted the place for their garden club,
and give us a commemorative plaque.

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:41.114
Come off it, Harold.

01:24:41.719 --> 01:24:45.120
We´re not talking about
a multimillion-dollar corporation here.

01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:48.124
How much money
could their business possibly make?

01:24:48.259 --> 01:24:50.955
Our expenses ran a little away from us.

01:24:51.029 --> 01:24:54.430
l mean, between start-up costs,
freebies, camp supplies...

01:24:54.532 --> 01:24:58.161
the money to fix up this place
and miscellaneous expenses...

01:24:58.269 --> 01:24:59.759
our total profit...

01:24:59.904 --> 01:25:02.395
is $168.1 7.

01:25:03.474 --> 01:25:04.532
What?

01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:08.970
-That´s all?
-l can´t breathe. l have to go.

01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:11.211
They´re dropping like flies.

01:25:11.282 --> 01:25:13.580
lf memory serves me correctly...

01:25:13.818 --> 01:25:16.810
our committee bylaws state
that any company...

01:25:16.888 --> 01:25:21.655
must show a profit of $1,500 a year
to qualify as a viable business.

01:25:21.959 --> 01:25:24.519
These girls are obviously nowhere near that.

01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:28.759
Therefore, l see no reason
why they can´t use this as their office.

01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.194
Fine. Do whatever you want, Emily.
l don´t care.

01:25:34.605 --> 01:25:36.197
l need some air.

01:25:41.712 --> 01:25:45.546
l don´t think they´re quite used
to this tropical environment.

01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:47.982
Reminds me of my days in Calcutta.

01:25:49.754 --> 01:25:52.450
ls it always gonna be this hot in here?

01:25:55.193 --> 01:25:57.684
lt was turning into an amazing day.

01:25:57.962 --> 01:25:59.827
We got the greenhouse.

01:26:01.165 --> 01:26:03.395
Jackie hit his first home run.

01:26:22.687 --> 01:26:24.018
Cokie got it so bad...

01:26:24.088 --> 01:26:27.888
l knew it was the last time the BSC
would ever hear from Cokie Mason.

01:26:27.959 --> 01:26:29.790
For this summer, anyway.

01:26:29.861 --> 01:26:31.522
All right, Jackie!

01:26:42.573 --> 01:26:44.234
Way to go, Jackie!

01:26:50.681 --> 01:26:53.479
Will you go to the movies with me tonight?

01:26:54.085 --> 01:26:55.609
Alan, get real.

01:27:00.324 --> 01:27:01.382
l am.

01:27:01.626 --> 01:27:04.356
l´ve been trying to ask you out all summer.

01:27:06.998 --> 01:27:08.192
Really?

01:27:09.567 --> 01:27:10.659
Yeah.

01:27:16.974 --> 01:27:18.066
Okay.

01:27:31.889 --> 01:27:33.550
Are you lovebirds yet?

01:27:34.358 --> 01:27:37.088
When l got home,
there was another letter from my dad.

01:27:37.161 --> 01:27:41.825
l couldn´t believe l heard from him so soon.
lt used to be years between letters.

01:27:41.899 --> 01:27:43.389
Now it´s days.

01:27:45.570 --> 01:27:48.698
$168.1 7.

01:27:48.773 --> 01:27:50.297
We had a lot of overhead.

01:27:50.374 --> 01:27:52.934
Most businesses
don´t even survive their first year.

01:27:53.010 --> 01:27:55.103
We had to work out all the kinks.

01:27:55.179 --> 01:27:57.170
Are we taking the bed, Claudia?

01:27:57.248 --> 01:27:59.808
-We can´t take my furniture.
-What will we sit on?

01:27:59.884 --> 01:28:01.351
Can we take the rug?

01:28:01.419 --> 01:28:03.887
-l´m gonna miss it here.
-Me, too.

01:28:04.155 --> 01:28:07.022
-Where it all began. Right, Claud?
-Right.

01:28:07.091 --> 01:28:09.321
Can you get the licorice
from my nightstand?

01:28:09.393 --> 01:28:11.258
l don´t want to forget it.

01:28:12.964 --> 01:28:16.661
We spent some of the best years
of our lives in this place.

01:28:20.771 --> 01:28:23.001
lt´s so nice and cool in here.

01:28:35.386 --> 01:28:36.648
lt´s almost gone.

01:28:36.787 --> 01:28:38.618
-What?
-Summer.

01:28:46.264 --> 01:28:48.391
-Hi, Mrs. Haberman!
-Hello, Dawn.

01:28:48.733 --> 01:28:50.496
l´m sorry to bother you, but....

01:28:50.568 --> 01:28:53.435
The more we thought about it,
Claud´s room really was home.

01:28:53.504 --> 01:28:56.029
And Mrs. Haberman
had really come through for us.

01:28:56.107 --> 01:28:58.541
So, we figured
after what we´d put her through...

01:28:58.609 --> 01:29:01.578
the least we could do
was give her the greenhouse.

01:29:14.525 --> 01:29:16.584
lt´s all yours, Mrs. Haberman.

01:29:16.794 --> 01:29:18.887
-What do you mean?
-Come on.

01:29:21.299 --> 01:29:23.062
We thought you could use it.

01:29:23.134 --> 01:29:25.830
Might help you grow
all your flowers and stuff.

01:29:25.903 --> 01:29:29.600
We asked the nursery for whatever
might attract hummingbirds and butterflies.

01:29:29.674 --> 01:29:31.505
The sunflowers were my idea.

01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:38.673
l guess Stoneybrook could use
a nature conservancy.

01:29:42.987 --> 01:29:46.946
You guys are gonna end up
with your names on a plaque after all.

01:29:48.959 --> 01:29:51.189
Okay, we´ll put those there.

01:29:51.262 --> 01:29:54.129
All right, everybody. Come on. Group shot.

01:29:55.299 --> 01:29:58.791
After buying Mrs. Haberman plants
and getting our answering machine...

01:29:58.869 --> 01:30:00.928
all we were left with was $18.

01:30:01.505 --> 01:30:04.872
So we splurged and blew the whole thing
on an extra-large pizza...

01:30:04.942 --> 01:30:07.934
double cheese, double sauce,
double anchovies.

01:30:08.446 --> 01:30:11.438
Dawn had a tricolore salad, whatever that is.

01:30:11.849 --> 01:30:15.910
Mary Anne couldn´t believe we worked
the whole summer and got only a pizza.

01:30:15.986 --> 01:30:18.352
But l think we got a lot more than that.

01:30:18.422 --> 01:30:21.220
Claudia wasn´t the only one
with a test this summer.

01:30:21.292 --> 01:30:23.886
Each of us was tested in our own way.

01:30:23.961 --> 01:30:27.124
We really learned what it meant
to come through for each other...

01:30:27.198 --> 01:30:29.189
and how hard that can be.

01:30:29.367 --> 01:30:33.167
But l guess that´s what it takes sometimes
to really be a friend.

01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:36.728
Mom says, ´´lf you can count the number
of friends you have on one hand...

01:30:36.807 --> 01:30:38.172
´´that´s a lot. ´´

01:30:38.242 --> 01:30:41.405
l´ve got five fingers
and more than five friends.

01:30:42.413 --> 01:30:44.347
All right, everybody. Lean in.

01:30:44.448 --> 01:30:47.383
Mom says l´m way ahead. l think she´s right.

01:30:48.252 --> 01:30:49.810
And say, ´´trees.´´

01:30:49.887 --> 01:30:51.354
Trees!

01:33:20.271 --> 01:33:23.001
-What do you wanna do now?
-l don´t know. What do you wanna do?

01:33:23.073 --> 01:33:26.338
-l don´t know. What do you wanna do?
-l don´t know. What should we do?

01:33:26.410 --> 01:33:28.139
-l don´t know.
-l don´t know, either!

01:33:28.212 --> 01:33:30.112
lf you don´t know, l don´t know.

01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.512
-Are you hungry?
-Yeah.

01:33:32.583 --> 01:33:34.676
-What do you wanna eat?
-l don´t know.

01:33:34.752 --> 01:33:36.242
l don´t know, either.

01:33:36.587 --> 01:33:38.418
-Where do you wanna go?
-l don´t know.

01:33:38.489 --> 01:33:39.751
l don´t know, either.

01:33:39.823 --> 01:33:41.757
-What about you?
-l don´t know.

01:33:41.825 --> 01:33:44.316
You guys are useless. l´m going home.

01:33:47.316 --> 01:33:51.316
