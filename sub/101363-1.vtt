00:25.760 --> 00:27.227
<i>When Stephane Matteau
was traded</i>

00:27.261 --> 00:28.763
<i>to the Rangers at the deadline,</i>

00:28.796 --> 00:31.198
<i>he figured he'd
just be a spare player,</i>

00:31.231 --> 00:33.568
<i>waiting around in case
someone got hurt.</i>

00:33.601 --> 00:36.403
<i>That was March 1994.
Two months later...</i>

00:36.436 --> 00:37.772
<i>He's off to
the Devil's place,</i>

00:37.805 --> 00:39.473
<i>across ice into the far corner.</i>

00:39.507 --> 00:41.375
<i>Matteau swoops in to intercept.</i>

00:41.408 --> 00:42.510
<i>Matteau behind the net.</i>

00:42.544 --> 00:44.311
<i>Swings in front, he scores!</i>

00:44.344 --> 00:46.346
<i>Matteau, Matteau!</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:49.116
<i>Matteau, Stephane Matteau!</i>

00:49.149 --> 00:53.387
<i>And the Rangers have
one more hill to climb, baby!</i>

00:53.420 --> 00:55.455
<i>And it's Mount Vancouver!</i>

00:55.489 --> 00:57.792
<i>The Rangers are
headed to the finals!</i>

00:57.825 --> 01:00.394
<i>Which they
went on to win that year.</i>

01:00.427 --> 01:02.396
<i>That's the thing about hockey.</i>

01:02.429 --> 01:05.098
<i>As long as you're on
the ice, you have a chance.</i>

01:14.809 --> 01:18.145
I was at that Rangers game.
Seven years old.

01:18.178 --> 01:21.616
Got to see some players leave
MSG on 31st Street afterwards.

01:21.649 --> 01:22.584
Never forget it.

01:23.585 --> 01:24.786
Matteau gave me a thumbs up.

03:05.385 --> 03:08.488
Mom, I told you.
Don't wash my jersey every time.

03:08.523 --> 03:09.857
<i>That's me.</i>

03:09.891 --> 03:11.793
<i>And as far back
as I can remember,</i>

03:11.826 --> 03:13.493
<i>all I could
think about was hockey.</i>

03:17.330 --> 03:18.833
You forgot this last practice.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.970
Coach, why can't
we change on the fly?

03:24.839 --> 03:25.807
Next year.

03:26.808 --> 03:28.375
Can we at least keep score?

03:28.408 --> 03:30.778
Let's focus on having fun.

03:32.547 --> 03:33.781
Winning is fun.

03:33.815 --> 03:35.282
And the things
that will take you

03:35.315 --> 03:37.350
much further
than hockey ever will.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.988
Like discipline,
teamwork, and leadership.

03:42.924 --> 03:44.625
Come on, Bobby.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.627
You know no one on this team
is going to the NHL.

03:49.329 --> 03:51.766
Now, let's go get some pizza!

03:54.602 --> 03:57.404
Someone has to play
for the Rangers in 15 years.

04:02.342 --> 04:04.679
Sanders streaks through
the middle,

04:04.712 --> 04:05.813
splits the D-men.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.020
Think that's funny, Luke?

04:13.054 --> 04:14.856
What are you
going to do about it?

04:16.656 --> 04:17.558
I figured.

04:21.361 --> 04:24.464
Mr. Sanders, put your weapon away.

04:27.802 --> 04:28.936
Morning, lads.

04:28.970 --> 04:30.403
Morning.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.273
Mr. Sanders, Watkins, blazers.

04:34.509 --> 04:38.345
Mr. Watkins, last week
it was your left loafer.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.081
Now your blazer?

04:40.114 --> 04:43.350
It was right here,
Mr. Demeny, I promise!

04:43.383 --> 04:45.987
At recess you can
tell me your action plan

04:46.020 --> 04:47.522
for becoming responsible.

04:49.356 --> 04:50.057
Now.

04:51.626 --> 04:55.730
"We know what we are
but know not what we may be."

04:56.798 --> 04:57.698
Shakespeare.

04:58.800 --> 05:02.870
Today's assignment is
a gift to your future self.

05:04.404 --> 05:08.441
Each of you will write a letter
to yourself, and seal it.

05:08.475 --> 05:14.782
I will mail your letter
to you in 15 years.

05:14.816 --> 05:17.585
Write about what
you hope you may be.

05:18.753 --> 05:21.122
Sitting in this classroom,

05:21.155 --> 05:25.325
there may be a conductor
of the philharmonic...

05:26.661 --> 05:28.830
chief justice
of the Supreme Court.

05:31.966 --> 05:37.638
And perhaps the owner
of the New York Rangers

05:37.672 --> 05:38.940
ice hockey team.

05:41.075 --> 05:42.677
You have 15 minutes.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.346
Think about the future.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.185
<i>"Dear me..."</i>

05:53.486 --> 05:56.090
<i>I knew
exactly who I was going to be,</i>

05:56.123 --> 05:58.593
<i>and it wasn't
the owner of the Rangers.</i>

06:06.801 --> 06:10.171
- Ah, the new guy from New York.
- That's me.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.639
- Stewey.
- Bobby.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.708
- Welcome aboard.
- Glad to be here.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.977
- How's it look?
- Looks good.

06:16.010 --> 06:17.845
So, you want to
get your name and number

06:17.879 --> 06:19.180
up in the rafters like Clearys?

06:19.213 --> 06:22.917
- Absolutely.
- Okay, skate hard.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.752
Keep your mouth shut.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.822
- And don't be barking at the refs, got it?
- Got it.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.591
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

06:40.735 --> 06:42.670
<i>I played
forward for two seasons.</i>

06:44.538 --> 06:45.606
<i>And then this.</i>

06:47.942 --> 06:49.944
L four and five
are really herniated,

06:49.977 --> 06:52.213
and they're just
pressing on this nerve.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.981
I'm really surprised
that the pain in your leg

06:54.015 --> 06:55.683
hasn't started until now.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.019
So then what's
the deal, more epidurals?

06:58.052 --> 07:01.923
No, I just don't think
they'll work at this point.

07:01.956 --> 07:03.891
Okay, look, how do I
get back on the ice?

07:03.925 --> 07:06.093
I mean, maybe if the Rangers
draft you in the first round,

07:06.127 --> 07:07.828
a second surgery
could make sense,

07:07.862 --> 07:10.164
but I can't
recommend that to you right now.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.432
Until other alternatives
are explored.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.970
To manage the pain.

07:24.011 --> 07:27.048
Like any normal person,
I got a second opinion,

07:27.081 --> 07:30.718
and WebMD convinced me
I had tertiary syphilis.

07:31.719 --> 07:32.753
Whatever that is.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.023
Then came alternative therapies.

07:36.057 --> 07:38.793
Electric stimulation
just spread MRSA.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.930
Acupuncture with Dr. Wong
cured my allergies,

07:42.964 --> 07:44.765
but not my back.

07:44.799 --> 07:46.801
And hypnosis didn't do shit.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.137
These didn't
really do anything either.

07:50.171 --> 07:51.739
Although two of them
on an empty stomach

07:51.772 --> 07:54.742
did turn Science B47:
Cosmic Connections

07:54.775 --> 07:57.645
into a transcendent experience.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.281
I even got a B plus
on my final project.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.516
A diorama of Sombrero Galaxy.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.219
Yeah.

08:09.123 --> 08:10.891
<i>The surgery was a success,</i>

08:10.925 --> 08:13.694
<i>but the recovery kept me
off the ice through graduation.</i>

08:13.728 --> 08:15.563
<i>If I wanted to
play hockey again,</i>

08:15.596 --> 08:16.998
<i>my only option was to find</i>

08:17.031 --> 08:19.066
<i>a minor league
team located in an area</i>

08:19.100 --> 08:21.102
<i>that didn't have internet access</i>

08:21.135 --> 08:23.704
<i>so they wouldn't be able to
look up my stats from college.</i>

08:47.094 --> 08:49.196
Figure skating was an hour ago.

08:49.230 --> 08:50.831
That was a dog shit call, ref.

08:50.865 --> 08:52.533
That was a great call.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.995
Two minutes till full time.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.790
Right side, idiots!

09:00.123 --> 09:01.708
As a reminder,

09:01.792 --> 09:06.463
after last Saturday's incident

09:06.547 --> 09:10.050
alcohol will not be served
after the first period.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.987
What did you do to get here?

09:13.020 --> 09:15.256
I think it was hooking or tripping.

09:15.289 --> 09:17.725
I don't know.
It was a dogshit call.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.293
No, no, no, no, no.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.863
Why is a Harvard guy
playing hockey here?

09:25.099 --> 09:27.935
Can I get an autograph
for my ten-year old son?

09:30.104 --> 09:31.972
You got a pen?

09:32.006 --> 09:34.175
You played with
Matthew Sullivan at Harvard.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.178
You must still be friends, no?

09:39.213 --> 09:42.750
They say he's going to
be NHL rookie of the year.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.251
He's my son's favorite player.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.322
All right, I'll tell you what.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.093
You shave ten seconds
off my penalty,

09:52.126 --> 09:54.995
I'll get you
a signed jersey from him.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.697
Six seconds.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.799
Game worn jersey.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.301
Fine.

10:00.334 --> 10:02.236
- Eight seconds.
- Yeah.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.678
My address.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.618
You're free!

10:22.256 --> 10:24.892
Now, we all have our stories
as to how we got here.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.428
While I was in college,

10:27.461 --> 10:29.330
that guy was in
a Kazakhstani prison.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.300
Guard, not inmate. I think.

10:33.334 --> 10:36.137
This guy, best athlete
on the team.

10:36.170 --> 10:38.906
Apparently competed
in the last winter Olympics

10:38.939 --> 10:41.041
in pairs figure skating.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.978
Doesn't really matter that I can't
pronounce any of their names.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.880
We're all laser-focused
on the game.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.651
And no matter how many fans
show up, or don't...

10:51.452 --> 10:52.853
the clock's always ticking.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.656
And someone's always watching.

10:59.193 --> 11:00.094
Yeah!

11:08.335 --> 11:10.587
Well done! Keep it up, lads!

11:14.975 --> 11:17.211
<i>And the beauty of
scoring a game's first goal</i>

11:17.244 --> 11:19.280
<i>in these
European minor leagues...</i>

11:21.882 --> 11:23.250
You're set with
groceries for the week.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.229
Nice goal tonight.

11:37.298 --> 11:39.200
You studied this
in Holland, right?

11:39.233 --> 11:41.869
Um, it was Belgium, actually.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.771
My main sponsor
pulled out a week ago,

11:43.804 --> 11:45.372
so the team went bankrupt.

11:45.406 --> 11:46.941
Happens in Germany, too.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.246
You're wasting your time.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.116
I don't know, man.
It kind of feels like a step up to me.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.352
With that.
It hasn't worked in two years.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.856
Living the dream, aren't we?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.036
Jesus, fuck.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.439
Shit.

12:18.472 --> 12:20.341
<i>There are two moments
you never forget.</i>

12:21.875 --> 12:23.944
<i>The first time you
walk into a locker room...</i>

12:25.246 --> 12:27.081
<i>and the last.</i>

12:29.517 --> 12:31.118
And that's how
they let you know.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.754
They take your pants.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.329
Cut or traded?

12:43.598 --> 12:45.833
Traded, part of a package deal.

12:52.574 --> 12:53.541
Where to?

12:54.509 --> 12:55.409
Up.

12:57.579 --> 12:59.046
Up like what?

12:59.079 --> 13:01.882
Up like North
or like a higher league?

13:02.584 --> 13:03.484
Both.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.597
When I was a kid,

13:15.630 --> 13:17.131
I thought that there
was some sort of correlation

13:17.164 --> 13:18.899
between how far North you are

13:18.932 --> 13:20.602
and how good the hockey is.

13:20.635 --> 13:23.103
You know, like Buffalo
was better than New York City,

13:23.137 --> 13:27.041
Toronto was better than
Buffalo, you get the idea.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.209
By that logic,
I should probably be surrounded

13:29.243 --> 13:31.078
by a bunch of
Sidney Crosby's here.

13:37.084 --> 13:37.985
Holy shit.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.593
Hey, uh...

13:46.927 --> 13:47.828
Hey.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.033
Um...

13:53.067 --> 13:54.234
You from around here?

13:56.003 --> 13:58.939
Yeah, not too far,
a couple Swedish miles.

13:58.972 --> 13:59.873
Cool.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.946
Um... is that a good book?

14:07.649 --> 14:10.652
- You must be the new American.
- Yes.

14:10.685 --> 14:13.053
The goal-scoring forward
who's going to save the season.

14:13.087 --> 14:14.888
I don't know about that,
but I'm going to try.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.323
- It's all in the papers.
- Oh.

14:16.357 --> 14:17.659
My little brother
goes to all the home games.

14:17.692 --> 14:19.326
Thousands of fans.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.427
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.465
Actually, would you
mind signing something for him?

14:24.498 --> 14:26.634
- Oh, God, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like an autograph?

14:26.668 --> 14:28.902
Let's see if I have anything.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.337
Maybe you could write on this?

14:30.371 --> 14:31.539
See if I have a pen.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.409
- <i>Voilà.</i>
- Found one.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.149
His friends will be so jealous
when he's the first

14:42.182 --> 14:43.984
to get the new American
footballer's autograph.

14:45.085 --> 14:45.953
Footballer?

14:47.488 --> 14:50.157
Soccer, as you
Americans call it, right?

14:52.527 --> 14:54.428
Hey, fuckface.

14:55.563 --> 14:56.564
Let's go.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.970
- Sorry. Yeah.
- Thank you.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.238
Now don't freeze to death.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.444
Well, hey, listen. Um...

15:10.477 --> 15:12.279
Tell your brother
maybe he should bring

15:12.312 --> 15:14.181
his sister to a game sometime.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.083
- Okay, I'll do that.
- Okay, good.

15:18.152 --> 15:19.052
Let's go.

15:19.837 --> 15:20.963
Will you come with us into town?

15:21.463 --> 15:23.048
No, thanks, Tomas,
I'm waiting to get picked up.

15:23.549 --> 15:24.550
That's good.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.029
I think you forgot something.

15:35.169 --> 15:36.504
Might be useful.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.074
Why?

15:42.042 --> 15:43.477
All right, let's go.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.779
- See you later.
- See you.

15:49.383 --> 15:52.252
Okay, welcome to Sweden.

16:12.807 --> 16:15.309
<i>You never fly
directly to these towns.</i>

16:15.342 --> 16:17.444
<i>You take a plane, then a train,</i>

16:17.478 --> 16:21.081
<i>then a bus, and
sometimes a shitty Volvo wagon</i>

16:21.114 --> 16:22.416
<i>with a snow plow.</i>

16:26.320 --> 16:27.488
Three rules for players.

16:28.756 --> 16:32.392
One, give me
everything you have on the ice,

16:32.426 --> 16:33.994
practices and games.

16:34.729 --> 16:38.365
Number two, if you get
the puck in the defensive zone,

16:38.398 --> 16:40.434
you have two options.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.302
Chip it out or fuck off.

16:44.739 --> 16:47.107
And three is
no shitting on the bus.

16:47.842 --> 16:49.042
Works for me.

17:13.742 --> 17:14.576
What the hell?

17:15.536 --> 17:16.828
I thought you quit.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.582
- That'll have to be next season.
- Well, that's good.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.313
Oy, oy, oy.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.066
Okay.

17:47.902 --> 17:49.336
Oh, not you, fuckface.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.239
Just this beauty.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.844
- Hey. What's up, man?
- Hey, nice to meet you.

18:29.877 --> 18:31.478
- I'm Gabbe.
- Bobby.

18:31.512 --> 18:32.814
Nice to meet you. Great salad.

18:32.847 --> 18:35.215
Thanks. Come on.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.517
Oh, God.

18:36.551 --> 18:37.785
So this is
pretty much it.

18:37.819 --> 18:38.820
This is the castle.

18:39.721 --> 18:41.321
You have either bed over here.

18:41.355 --> 18:43.825
This is where we eat
breakfast, lunch, dinner.

18:43.858 --> 18:45.292
That's the kitchen over there.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.828
Hey, where's the bathroom?

18:46.861 --> 18:48.195
Up the hill.

18:49.664 --> 18:51.264
Up the hill?

18:51.298 --> 18:53.501
It's only temporary
during tryout period.

18:53.534 --> 18:55.603
Once they have contract,

18:55.637 --> 18:57.605
I think we'll
move to better housing.

18:57.639 --> 18:58.539
Jesus.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.714
So, how long after do we rinse?

19:06.748 --> 19:08.883
No rinse, man.
It's a leave-in conditioner.

19:08.916 --> 19:11.385
- Needs time for the biotin to activate.
- Mm-hmm.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.887
Don't use too much, it's
going to weigh down the hair.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.623
So use about
the size of a kronor.

19:16.758 --> 19:18.191
Plus, it's very expensive.

19:25.667 --> 19:26.868
What they get in return?

19:27.935 --> 19:30.505
Enough cash for
a boss washer dryer combo.

19:32.940 --> 19:34.842
Which model?

19:34.876 --> 19:37.712
300 series, 14 cycles.

19:37.745 --> 19:39.614
Stainless steel, stain feature.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.056
Bloody hell.

19:41.983 --> 19:43.383
You must be a goal scorer.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.256
What the hell is that?

19:49.289 --> 19:51.693
That's <i>ragga runda.</i>

19:51.726 --> 19:55.763
Just silly guys racing around
cars trying to pick up girls.

19:56.831 --> 19:57.832
Small town shit.

20:06.607 --> 20:09.577
<i>You always smell a
locker room before you see it.</i>

20:09.610 --> 20:11.278
It's the same everywhere.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.280
That unmistakable scent
that only smells good

20:13.313 --> 20:14.916
to those that
have contributed to it.

20:14.949 --> 20:17.484
And then there's the sounds.

20:18.886 --> 20:20.888
A collective groan
from a group of guys

20:20.922 --> 20:22.724
when someone interrupts a story

20:22.757 --> 20:24.458
or delivers a punchline
a little too early

20:24.491 --> 20:25.526
just to be a stain.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.761
We were playing Smash Bros.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.031
And then Ragge said,
"I can't do it,

20:30.064 --> 20:31.999
because condom is too tight."

20:33.701 --> 20:36.003
- Hey, pal. Dean.
- Bobby, nice to meet you.

20:36.037 --> 20:37.538
- Yeah, you too.
- Where you from?

20:37.572 --> 20:40.041
- Sunshine state, you?
- New York.

20:40.074 --> 20:40.975
Right on.

20:41.008 --> 20:42.476
King Roos!

20:42.510 --> 20:43.644
Best jet fuel in Sweden.

20:43.678 --> 20:44.746
Hey, Roos, how's it going?

20:44.779 --> 20:46.480
- America.
- Thanks, buddy.

20:50.484 --> 20:51.919
Oh, fuck me. That's really good.

20:51.953 --> 20:53.788
- Yeah, it's best in the league.
- Huh.

20:54.889 --> 20:57.525
- What's up?
- What about that guy? Is he on the team?

20:57.558 --> 20:58.793
Yeah. Dick pics lately?

20:58.826 --> 21:00.360
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

21:01.529 --> 21:03.396
Yeah, he's captain
for the last five years.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.566
Oh, shit.
What's with the, uh, longer one?

21:05.600 --> 21:07.367
Uh, bag skates?

21:09.144 --> 21:11.063
On the ice in twenty minutes.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.507
20 minutes.

21:16.978 --> 21:18.980
No practice for you today.

21:19.013 --> 21:20.447
Oh, no, I can skate, coach.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.617
Ay, you take a rest.

21:23.518 --> 21:25.385
We have some
important games this week.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.021
All right, all right. You win.

21:27.054 --> 21:28.990
- Whatever you say.
- Fuckface, you meet shithead?

21:29.023 --> 21:30.558
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we met, coach.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.928
I hope you bring
some super shootout moves.

21:33.961 --> 21:36.030
If you lose, you wind up
with something like this.

21:36.063 --> 21:38.866
- Ah, it's starting to grow on me.
- It suits you. Look like, uh...

21:38.900 --> 21:40.034
- Tom Selleck.
- Captain Hook.

21:40.067 --> 21:41.368
Nej, Gustav.

21:42.069 --> 21:44.605
You sleep in,
you dress the part.

21:48.142 --> 21:49.677
Get fucked.

21:49.710 --> 21:51.344
What's up?
You have shoulder bark?

21:52.780 --> 21:55.950
No, got to Omaha hi-lo
split tourney in 45 minutes.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.317
Got to be at the casino.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.688
Wish me luck, boys.

22:00.721 --> 22:02.355
- Hey Deaner.
- Yeah?

22:02.389 --> 22:04.025
Win big money.
Bring back penis pump

22:04.058 --> 22:05.860
and two Viagra for Ragge.

22:05.893 --> 22:07.662
He's going
to need three.

22:12.767 --> 22:15.136
You sure? This is
an absurd amount of caviar.

22:15.169 --> 22:16.838
- Let's get it.
- You think so?

22:16.871 --> 22:18.105
Holy shit. I know that girl.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.923
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

22:20.215 --> 22:21.758
- I'm good, what about you?
- I'm good, how are you?

22:21.842 --> 22:22.843
Well, very good.

22:23.544 --> 22:24.444
Hey again.

22:25.546 --> 22:26.848
Oh, I don't think we met before.

22:26.881 --> 22:29.016
You're
the footballer, remember?

22:29.984 --> 22:32.419
Isn't ringing any bells.

22:32.452 --> 22:33.754
The weirdo from the bus stop.

22:33.788 --> 22:35.857
Oh, it's you! Yeah.

22:35.890 --> 22:36.991
Thought I recognized you.

22:37.024 --> 22:38.659
- I'm Elin.
- I'm Bobby.

22:38.693 --> 22:39.827
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to meet you again.

22:39.861 --> 22:40.761
Yeah.

22:41.896 --> 22:43.463
Will you be
using your Lingen bucks?

22:44.932 --> 22:47.935
Oh, we get, uh, 200 kronor
in store credit per week.

22:47.969 --> 22:50.671
- Store credit?
- It's part of the hockey sponsorship deal.

22:50.705 --> 22:52.439
We'll use our credit.

22:52.472 --> 22:53.541
Okay, that's good.

22:56.978 --> 22:58.579
Kalles Caviar.

22:58.613 --> 22:59.814
A lot of Kalles caviar.

22:59.847 --> 23:01.582
Hey, it's this guy. It's not me.

23:11.158 --> 23:12.793
Looks like
you're rated 15th among

23:12.827 --> 23:15.462
European skaters for
this year's NHL draft.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.899
Funny, I always
wanted to play football.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.501
Bye, Dean.

23:20.534 --> 23:22.603
See you soon?

23:22.637 --> 23:24.038
We play Tuesday?

23:24.071 --> 23:25.840
Monday night still work?

23:25.873 --> 23:27.608
If you bring
your cute friend.

23:28.643 --> 23:29.977
We're 4-0
the night's she's slept over.

23:30.011 --> 23:31.612
It's not about me, Gustav.

23:31.646 --> 23:32.713
It's about the team.

23:34.048 --> 23:37.018
- Right, boys?
- Shouldn't you be leading a revolution, Poncho?

23:37.051 --> 23:38.586
I don't even
know what that means.

23:43.465 --> 23:47.803
Okay, guys, we are reviewing

23:48.554 --> 23:52.808
the Robitaille game.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.605
You're in
offensive zone, face off head.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.398
We have a...

23:59.481 --> 24:01.567
Then down the field...

24:02.243 --> 24:04.245
The game exists on many levels.

24:04.278 --> 24:06.580
There's the theoretical game.

24:07.281 --> 24:10.200
Run fast as hell.

24:10.651 --> 24:11.752
There's the actual game.

24:12.653 --> 24:14.689
There's the game
coaches play with players,

24:14.722 --> 24:16.456
players play with refs.

24:17.825 --> 24:20.628
There's the games that we play
with ourselves in our own mind.

24:21.795 --> 24:23.422
So that you don't get stuck.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.133
Then down the field with the puck,

24:26.216 --> 24:28.719
and forward, you cover the damn
defense here on the blue line.

24:29.937 --> 24:30.838
Bam!

24:31.680 --> 24:37.418
So, if a single bastard messes up,
then he ruins the entire game plan.

24:37.473 --> 24:40.114
We must 100% focus from start.

24:42.616 --> 24:44.785
If just one guy fucks the dog,

24:45.720 --> 24:46.654
the play won't work.

24:48.155 --> 24:49.448
The rest will work itself out.

24:50.991 --> 24:51.950
All good?

24:52.560 --> 24:54.028
- Yeah.
- Surely.

24:54.061 --> 24:56.163
Now, work strong,
fuckers, today, huh?

24:59.300 --> 25:00.701
- Did you get...
- I know. I didn't.

25:00.735 --> 25:03.204
It's not English,
so I rarely do.

25:05.172 --> 25:06.974
Behind the left!

25:07.008 --> 25:07.875
Behind the left!

25:10.811 --> 25:13.848
Nobody has 99
on his jersey, fuckers.

25:13.881 --> 25:15.983
Make the pass
when you get the lane!

25:16.017 --> 25:16.917
Dean.

25:20.855 --> 25:23.190
- Okay, it's time for the Robitaille.
- Okay.

25:24.992 --> 25:26.260
All right, what's the play?

25:26.293 --> 25:28.562
He wants us to
run the Robitaille.

25:28.596 --> 25:30.231
- What the fuck's a Robitaille?
- No idea.

25:30.264 --> 25:32.099
Who knows? Just get the puck
to me. We'll figure it out.

25:39.206 --> 25:41.075
Get the puck
to the winger!

25:44.111 --> 25:45.980
That's not the Robitaille!

25:51.719 --> 25:53.120
- Nice work, buddy.
- Thanks a lot.

25:53.154 --> 25:54.789
Dean! Dean.

25:56.757 --> 25:58.025
Reverse Robitaille.

25:58.059 --> 25:59.927
- Works every time.
- Mm-hmm.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.763
So, this is enough for you?

26:02.797 --> 26:04.198
Huh?

26:04.231 --> 26:05.733
Because that's
what it looks like.

26:06.634 --> 26:08.302
One big fucking joke.

26:11.172 --> 26:13.107
Okay, boys.

26:13.140 --> 26:15.009
We finish with a nice shootout

26:15.042 --> 26:17.144
and Dean will go get changed,

26:17.178 --> 26:19.580
so he doesn't get
late for his casino.

26:20.281 --> 26:21.782
Go, go!

26:51.912 --> 26:53.280
I like it.

26:53.314 --> 26:54.215
Keep doing it.

26:55.149 --> 26:56.617
Make me very happy.

27:06.710 --> 27:08.712
Bye, bye!

27:12.399 --> 27:15.769
Elin! You should come
out an dance with us.

27:15.803 --> 27:17.071
Too sober to dance right now.

27:17.104 --> 27:18.105
Maybe later, okay?

27:18.139 --> 27:19.240
Suit yourself.

27:25.880 --> 27:26.947
Hey, all right.

27:41.662 --> 27:43.121
Well, look at that.

27:43.413 --> 27:45.499
The cute American football player is here.

27:46.133 --> 27:50.070
Look, I got
"hello" and "footballer."

27:50.104 --> 27:51.906
- The rest is...
- You almost got it.

27:51.939 --> 27:53.440
- Almost? Yeah, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

27:53.474 --> 27:54.909
I'll have to...

27:55.843 --> 27:58.012
Hey, you think I could
get a, like a Carlsberg?

27:58.045 --> 27:59.046
Is that cool?

28:01.081 --> 28:02.383
Do you even have a brother?

28:03.317 --> 28:04.785
- Two?
- Two.

28:04.818 --> 28:06.720
Johan's at university
at Uppsala,

28:06.754 --> 28:09.089
and Elias is trying to
get through high school.

28:10.024 --> 28:10.925
What about you?

28:12.259 --> 28:14.728
I got through
high school and college.

28:14.762 --> 28:16.230
- Impressive.
- I know, high roller.

28:16.263 --> 28:18.199
- I meant siblings.
- Yeah, I know.

28:18.232 --> 28:21.402
I got, um, um, one.
Younger sister.

28:21.435 --> 28:23.505
Her name's Claire. She's 14.

28:23.538 --> 28:27.141
So she's, um,
a, uh, sophomore in high school.

28:27.174 --> 28:28.075
Tough age.

28:49.096 --> 28:51.198
- It's your turn now.
- To do that?

28:52.333 --> 28:53.801
I'd have to stretch first.

28:58.839 --> 29:01.108
- Have you ever been to Central Park?
- Central Park?

29:01.141 --> 29:03.277
Yeah, I grew up across
the street. On Museum Mile.

29:03.310 --> 29:05.846
The apartments
on 96th and 5th ave.

29:05.879 --> 29:07.014
By the Guggenheim!

29:07.047 --> 29:08.782
Yeah, well, like,
ten blocks away.

29:08.816 --> 29:10.150
Why, have you been before?

29:11.151 --> 29:13.187
- Never been to the U.S.
- Uh-huh.

29:13.220 --> 29:14.488
But I looked into working there.

29:14.522 --> 29:17.791
Oh, yeah, and what?
What happened?

29:17.825 --> 29:19.426
- I didn't hear back.
- Oh.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.862
But, it's still
on my bucket list.

29:21.895 --> 29:24.131
Bucket list? Maybe to-do list.

29:24.164 --> 29:26.000
I think you're a little
too young for a bucket list.

29:26.033 --> 29:28.469
- To-do list.
- Okay, I didn't mean it in that way.

29:28.503 --> 29:30.304
Um, well, hey,
when you do decide to go,

29:30.337 --> 29:32.139
I think you'll love it.

29:32.172 --> 29:34.475
Like, everything you
could ever want is right there.

29:34.509 --> 29:37.278
So why are you
here in Nowhere, Sweden?

29:37.311 --> 29:39.813
Well, um,
playing hockey professionally

29:39.847 --> 29:41.215
is the one thing
I couldn't do there.

29:41.248 --> 29:42.550
I could barely do it here.

29:43.992 --> 29:45.244
Welcome to Sweden!

29:45.520 --> 29:46.854
- Tak?
- Tak.

29:46.887 --> 29:47.921
- Tak.
- Tak.

29:47.955 --> 29:49.089
Mm. Tak.

29:56.631 --> 29:58.132
So, how did it go
last night?

29:59.166 --> 30:00.067
Good.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.503
I think.

30:01.536 --> 30:03.304
I'm supposed to
see her next week.

30:04.371 --> 30:08.610
Nice. Want some, uh,
Kalles caviar on your <i>krakes?</i>

30:08.643 --> 30:09.544
Um...

30:10.352 --> 30:11.895
It...

30:11.912 --> 30:16.283
Mm, close. It's not hears
delicious, it sounds delicious.

30:16.441 --> 30:17.776
It sounds delicious.

30:17.860 --> 30:21.267
- It sounds delicious.
- Yeah, it sounds delicious.

30:21.324 --> 30:22.557
That's good!

30:23.525 --> 30:24.526
- Okay.
- There you are.

30:24.559 --> 30:26.260
Thank you.

30:26.293 --> 30:28.596
- I can't wait to cook in a real kitchen.
- Mm.

30:32.966 --> 30:35.637
Mm, so much for
our relaxing breakfast.

30:35.670 --> 30:37.938
You're in check by the way.

30:37.971 --> 30:39.507
- Check?
- Fuck you, check.

30:39.541 --> 30:41.041
Better move your king.

30:41.075 --> 30:41.975
Come on.

30:45.888 --> 30:47.097
It sounds delicious.

30:48.082 --> 30:49.183
Hey, just Sanders.

30:50.484 --> 30:52.219
Gabbe's ride's on its way.

30:53.921 --> 30:54.855
See you later, man.

30:55.689 --> 30:57.065
I'll see you on the ice, yeah?

30:58.292 --> 30:59.393
See you later, buddy.

31:07.334 --> 31:08.235
Let's go.

31:13.941 --> 31:15.577
Yo.

31:19.179 --> 31:20.981
- Hey, coach. How you doing?
- Ah.

31:21.982 --> 31:23.484
Take a seat, Bobby.

31:35.630 --> 31:38.666
We've had to make some hard
decisions on players, Bobby.

31:41.268 --> 31:43.170
As you know, it's, uh,

31:43.203 --> 31:46.006
expensive to have
an extra American on the club.

31:49.644 --> 31:50.612
So...

31:53.347 --> 31:58.185
this is a contract
for the rest of the season.

32:04.158 --> 32:05.959
I hope you're
worth it, fuckface.

32:08.195 --> 32:09.430
Thanks, coach.

32:09.463 --> 32:10.364
Nice work.

32:17.404 --> 32:19.507
So, play better, right?

32:19.541 --> 32:20.642
Will do. Thank you, coach.

32:23.177 --> 32:25.045
<i>It's our shared passion
for the game</i>

32:25.078 --> 32:27.014
<i>that creates a deep
understanding of one another's</i>

32:27.047 --> 32:29.082
<i>hardships on and off the ice.</i>

32:30.050 --> 32:33.287
<i>However, we are each
other's greatest competition,</i>

32:33.320 --> 32:34.988
<i>and having success on the ice...</i>

32:36.190 --> 32:38.258
<i>is always at the expense
of someone else.</i>

32:55.610 --> 32:57.211
They take your pants
when you're cut?

32:57.244 --> 32:59.781
Yes, well, it's,
they're never really your pants.

32:59.814 --> 33:01.415
They're more on loan, basically.

33:02.650 --> 33:04.652
- So impersonal.
- Is it? You think so?

33:04.686 --> 33:07.421
- Yes.
- Yeah, all right. Maybe I got used to it.

33:07.454 --> 33:08.723
- Really.
- Mm.

33:08.756 --> 33:10.424
How did Gabbe
take it when he was cut?

33:11.358 --> 33:13.160
Um, I don't know.

33:13.193 --> 33:14.796
I didn't really get a chance
to see him before he left.

33:14.829 --> 33:17.064
- You haven't spoken to him since?
- No.

33:17.097 --> 33:20.200
- So no goodbye?
- No, well, we're not really big on goodbyes.

33:20.234 --> 33:22.804
The longer you do this, the more it
just kind of happens to everyone.

33:22.837 --> 33:24.506
So, that's how it works.

33:24.539 --> 33:27.341
- Kind of sad.
- You think so?

33:27.374 --> 33:29.142
- I don't...
- Not saying goodbye to your new friends.

33:29.176 --> 33:32.680
Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean,
kind of the best relationships

33:32.714 --> 33:34.582
I've ever had though
have been these ones where I,

33:34.616 --> 33:36.416
you know, these fleeting ones
where I don't have to

33:36.450 --> 33:38.085
say goodbye, I guess.

33:38.118 --> 33:39.386
- That's really sad.
- Is that sad?

33:39.419 --> 33:41.623
- Yeah, very sad.
- Is that really pathetic?

33:41.656 --> 33:44.124
Well, the good news
is you've got a contract,

33:44.157 --> 33:46.594
and I think that's
worth celebrating, you know?

33:46.628 --> 33:48.328
- Have you had Swedish food?
- No, I haven't.

33:48.362 --> 33:49.363
Do you want to try some?

33:50.072 --> 33:52.094
- It sounds delicious.
- It sounds delicious?

33:52.132 --> 33:53.400
- Yeah.
- Good Swedish.

33:53.433 --> 33:55.068
I'm trying.

33:55.102 --> 33:56.671
So food must be pretty
good in this place, huh?

33:56.704 --> 33:58.773
- Trust me, it's not the food.
- Mm-hmm.

33:58.806 --> 34:00.340
Lindefors is closed on Sundays,

34:00.374 --> 34:01.509
so this is
the only place that's open.

34:01.543 --> 34:03.310
- Oh.
- Tak.

34:04.311 --> 34:05.580
Uh, English for you.

34:05.613 --> 34:07.347
Yes, please. Thank you so much.

34:07.506 --> 34:10.007
- Thanks.
- Who's the cute American?

34:10.092 --> 34:11.510
He is kind of cute, isn't he?

34:11.592 --> 34:12.759
- Hockey player?
- Yes.

34:12.806 --> 34:14.789
Um, cute footballer, actually.

34:16.255 --> 34:17.792
We don't have
a football team here.

34:19.293 --> 34:21.460
- You guys don't have a football team?
- We don't have a football team.

34:21.495 --> 34:22.664
Sorry, I lied before.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.301
You know what?

34:27.333 --> 34:28.503
- What?
- I was thinking.

34:28.536 --> 34:29.771
Thinking.

34:29.804 --> 34:31.606
I think we should end this.

34:31.639 --> 34:33.106
End what?

34:33.139 --> 34:35.175
- What're we talking about?
- This.

34:35.208 --> 34:36.610
Us, like our relationship.

34:36.643 --> 34:38.277
- Mm.
- Spare us both the heartache.

34:38.312 --> 34:40.614
Yes, yes. End, so you're ending

34:41.549 --> 34:43.350
this on our first date.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.752
Okay.

34:44.786 --> 34:47.855
And, um, I really
enjoyed our time together,

34:47.889 --> 34:49.657
and I think you're
a really sweet guy, Bobby.

34:49.690 --> 34:51.826
- Mm-hmm.
- It's been magical.

34:52.793 --> 34:55.395
I just feel like
we've been drifting apart

34:55.429 --> 34:56.697
over these past few minutes.

34:56.731 --> 34:58.398
Yeah, you know,
I'm not surprised.

34:58.432 --> 34:59.834
I'm hurt, but I'm not surprised.

34:59.867 --> 35:01.669
I sort of started
feeling a distance.

35:01.703 --> 35:03.370
- Uh, the moment we met...
- You felt, you felt it too.

35:03.403 --> 35:05.305
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:05.339 --> 35:06.674
I should really call my mom.
I think she was really

35:06.708 --> 35:08.308
banking on this one working out.

35:08.342 --> 35:09.877
Well, now that we
got it out of the way,

35:09.911 --> 35:11.646
should we just enjoy this?

35:12.680 --> 35:15.550
Yeah, well, sure, but there's
one thing first before we

35:15.583 --> 35:16.884
- call this quits.
- What?

35:16.918 --> 35:18.385
You think that
if, uh, we're breaking up

35:18.418 --> 35:20.655
you can split the bill maybe?

35:20.688 --> 35:22.857
We were going to split the bill
anyways. This is Sweden.

35:22.890 --> 35:24.726
Okay, well, then
maybe you can pay for me...

35:24.759 --> 35:26.259
...considering I'm so heartbroken.

35:31.899 --> 35:33.835
Hey, they let you keep
your skates and equipment on

35:33.868 --> 35:35.235
when they're taking
these measurements?

35:35.268 --> 35:36.537
Quit bullshitting around.
Let's go.

35:36.571 --> 35:38.171
Come on. Play the game.

35:38.205 --> 35:40.374
<i>That's
Matthew Sullivan. Sully.</i>

35:40.407 --> 35:42.510
<i>Plays forward for
the Pittsburgh Penguins.</i>

35:42.543 --> 35:43.878
<i>Best friend since college.</i>

36:00.394 --> 36:03.731
Yes, and Mackers is up next.

36:03.765 --> 36:05.265
Let's see what we got.

36:05.298 --> 36:07.835
You will be streaming gay porn

36:07.869 --> 36:09.871
on all wired
internet library computers.

36:09.904 --> 36:11.839
- Not too shabby.
- That's right up your alley.

36:11.873 --> 36:12.907
- Mack.
- What?

36:12.940 --> 36:14.274
Your costume's shit, by the way.

36:14.307 --> 36:15.510
It cost me 35 dollars.

36:16.443 --> 36:17.812
Ladies!

36:17.845 --> 36:19.881
Either of you happen
to find me lucky charms?

36:19.914 --> 36:21.749
Maybe the Sugar Plum Fairy
took them.

36:22.717 --> 36:25.252
I'm more of
a Wheaties guy myself.

36:25.285 --> 36:27.220
Great source of fiber.

36:27.254 --> 36:28.990
Let me guess,
lacrosse initiation?

36:30.858 --> 36:33.226
- Ouch.
- Best you just bus your trays

36:33.260 --> 36:35.997
and get out of here. Before you make
even bigger fools of yourselves.

36:36.030 --> 36:38.866
- Why you always got to be a dick?
- Fucking asshole.

36:38.900 --> 36:40.568
But seriously,
lacrosse initiation?

36:40.601 --> 36:42.269
Seriously? I don't know...

36:42.302 --> 36:43.303
What the fuck are you doing now?

36:43.336 --> 36:44.639
Updating the Penguins GM

36:44.672 --> 36:46.339
on how their
second round draft pick

36:46.373 --> 36:47.842
is preparing for the season.

36:48.776 --> 36:50.878
Oh, don't touch me!

36:50.912 --> 36:53.681
- <i>Why you benching me?</i>
- This guy's better than you.

36:53.715 --> 36:55.482
How's the girl?

36:55.516 --> 36:57.752
Well, she's Swedish.

36:57.785 --> 37:00.988
She's 23 and she's hot.

37:01.022 --> 37:02.690
The hell she doing with you?

37:03.858 --> 37:06.326
<i>That's the same bullshit
glitz goal you used in college.</i>

37:06.359 --> 37:07.260
<i>It's gutless.</i>

37:08.462 --> 37:09.964
All right, all right,
all right. Hit X.

37:09.997 --> 37:12.934
No. What's the point
of scoring if I can't cele?

37:12.967 --> 37:14.836
Why do we even have to
play with offsides anyway?

37:14.869 --> 37:16.838
Because you suck
at rock, paper, scissors.

37:18.405 --> 37:20.041
How are the girls in Pittsburgh?

37:20.074 --> 37:21.909
What do you think?
It's not Sweden.

37:21.943 --> 37:22.944
It's Pittsburgh.

37:24.377 --> 37:26.313
How's the body holding up?

37:26.346 --> 37:27.014
Good.

37:27.915 --> 37:29.884
Fucking bullshit skill stick.

37:29.917 --> 37:31.485
Are you serious?
You can't pause the game

37:31.519 --> 37:33.054
when I'm
in the middle of a breakaway.

37:33.087 --> 37:34.321
I got to get to practice.

37:34.354 --> 37:35.556
That's an automatic forfeit.

37:35.590 --> 37:37.525
Fuck that.
We'll finish up tonight.

37:37.558 --> 37:39.861
Hey, by the way, I'm going
to need another signed jersey.

37:39.894 --> 37:41.929
<i>It's going to have to
be game worn this time.</i>

37:43.064 --> 37:45.032
Hey, don't you
dare record that win.

37:45.066 --> 37:46.333
<i>All right, fine. Relax.</i>

37:48.936 --> 37:51.873
Robert H.

37:51.906 --> 37:53.273
Sanders!

37:58.679 --> 38:00.681
Would you rather make out
with the mustache girl

38:00.715 --> 38:03.084
from the kabob shop
five minutes,

38:03.117 --> 38:05.787
or get a hand job
from Ragge two minutes?

38:05.820 --> 38:07.922
- Eye contact?
- Goes without saying.

38:07.955 --> 38:09.757
- Kabob place on Kuddegard?
- Yeah.

38:09.791 --> 38:12.459
- Hand job Ragge for sure.
- Hand job Ragge.

38:12.492 --> 38:13.594
Yeah, hand job Ragge.

38:13.628 --> 38:15.395
Hey, hey!

38:15.428 --> 38:17.565
Do you know what he's
listening to all the time?

38:17.598 --> 38:18.533
Roos!

38:20.050 --> 38:21.718
He wants to know what you're listening to.

38:21.802 --> 38:24.179
If he scores tonight, I'll tell him.

38:25.807 --> 38:28.009
He says if you score
tonight, he will tell you.

38:31.444 --> 38:32.847
Wash your hands. That's gross.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.715
You know your blood type?

38:34.749 --> 38:36.818
O positive, negative.

38:36.851 --> 38:39.120
- Why?
- Leveque. Going to want to stay out of his way tonight.

38:39.153 --> 38:40.453
Oh, is this the guy?

38:40.487 --> 38:41.722
This is the guy.

38:41.756 --> 38:42.824
Two years in the show.

38:42.857 --> 38:44.091
Three years in the jail.

38:45.159 --> 38:46.627
Making his comeback.

38:46.661 --> 38:47.962
Yeah, well that's
some serious redemption.

38:47.995 --> 38:50.497
You got to respect that, bud.

38:50.531 --> 38:52.399
He tried to kill a guy
with a pair of scissors.

38:52.432 --> 38:53.768
Oh, well, good luck.

38:55.036 --> 38:57.104
I didn't even know he could do
that. I mean, it makes sense,

38:57.138 --> 39:00.007
but scissors? Jesus Christ.

39:00.041 --> 39:01.742
Don't want to
fuck with that guy.

39:05.445 --> 39:07.014
Hey, Leveque,
they sell those muffins

39:07.048 --> 39:08.749
by the dozen, you fucking plug?

39:11.519 --> 39:13.688
He's going to kill me
or he's going to kill you.

39:13.721 --> 39:14.622
Let's go.

39:49.306 --> 39:50.641
Come down!

40:02.103 --> 40:03.838
I fought him before.

40:03.871 --> 40:05.640
Even beat the piss
out of him one time.

40:06.574 --> 40:10.410
Of course, I was playing
<i>NHL '03</i> on my PlayStation 2.

40:12.146 --> 40:13.881
Fuck.

40:13.915 --> 40:15.716
- You don't want to do that.
- Yeah?

40:17.685 --> 40:19.921
Looks like your boy's trying
to give him French braids.

40:21.656 --> 40:22.723
What are you doing here?

40:23.624 --> 40:26.493
Way back to the NHL, you?

40:26.527 --> 40:28.529
- Still working on that.
- Huh.

40:29.563 --> 40:31.599
Going to be kind of tough
with your skates untied.

40:33.768 --> 40:35.102
Keep your head up out there, eh?

41:10.237 --> 41:12.173
Hey, my sister had
one of these growing up.

41:12.206 --> 41:13.240
One of what?

41:13.274 --> 41:15.676
Um, Pippi Longstocking doll.

41:17.111 --> 41:18.813
Pippi Langstrump.

41:18.846 --> 41:20.915
Oh, you guys had
your own name for it too?

41:20.948 --> 41:23.150
The Swedish fairytale
that you Americans stole.

41:23.184 --> 41:25.219
Yeah, well
that's what we do best.

41:25.252 --> 41:27.288
Although, you guys
did steal Halloween and

41:27.321 --> 41:30.524
uh, Mother's Day, Black Friday,
plastic surgery, and...

41:30.558 --> 41:32.593
You better be quiet
because Pippi Langstrump

41:32.626 --> 41:35.096
is the strongest girl in the
world and she will kick your butt.

41:35.129 --> 41:36.731
Oh, yeah? On dry land maybe.

41:36.764 --> 41:38.132
I think on skates
I could take her.

41:38.165 --> 41:39.767
No, no. Her dad's a sea captain

41:39.800 --> 41:41.936
so she's been
on the seas her whole life.

41:41.969 --> 41:45.639
India, China, Arabia.

41:45.673 --> 41:46.674
America.

41:47.775 --> 41:50.244
- Not yet, but she's going to get there.
- Right.

41:50.277 --> 41:51.579
Where are you taking me tonight?

41:51.612 --> 41:53.748
I am taking you

41:53.781 --> 41:55.750
on a camping trip
in the Carpathians.

41:55.783 --> 41:57.785
Whether we make it
back is a risky prospect.

41:57.818 --> 41:59.320
Tell me
where we're going.

41:59.353 --> 42:00.588
Come on.

42:04.859 --> 42:06.093
Ladies first.

42:13.734 --> 42:15.002
All right, one second.

42:17.004 --> 42:18.072
You're going to have to help me.

42:18.105 --> 42:20.141
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

42:20.174 --> 42:23.110
And we're... gliding.

42:23.144 --> 42:24.845
And we're float... Oh.

42:26.247 --> 42:28.949
You got it. Ready.

42:28.983 --> 42:30.651
Hey, Roos!

42:35.923 --> 42:37.858
Thanks, bud.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.228
You are welcome, fuckface.

42:42.963 --> 42:44.899
This is very
sweet of you, fuckface.

42:44.932 --> 42:46.801
- Oh, thank you so much.
- This is beautiful.

42:46.834 --> 42:48.169
- That's, wow.
- Thank you.

42:48.202 --> 42:49.970
Thank me once we survive this.

42:50.004 --> 42:51.906
Yes, you have to, you
have to teach me how to do this.

42:51.939 --> 42:54.108
- All right, ready? So...
- So.

42:54.141 --> 42:56.177
You push off,
say, with your right foot

42:56.210 --> 42:58.779
and then glide on your
left and then vice versa.

42:58.813 --> 43:00.214
- You got it?
- Okay.

43:00.247 --> 43:01.982
- You got it?
- Eh.

43:02.016 --> 43:03.651
That's pretty good!

43:03.684 --> 43:04.785
Kind of doing it.

43:04.819 --> 43:06.053
Can you try and just...

43:42.256 --> 43:47.962
I have seen a Picasso
exhibit somewhere before.

43:47.995 --> 43:50.197
- That's Cubism. Not impressionism.
- Yeah.

43:50.231 --> 43:53.334
Cubists painting
have a more deranged idea

43:53.367 --> 43:56.770
of time and space
and matter and objects.

43:56.804 --> 44:00.141
- Okay.
- While us Impressionists, which are my favorite.

44:00.174 --> 44:01.208
Right.

44:01.242 --> 44:03.677
They use vivid brush strokes

44:03.711 --> 44:07.148
and dream-like colors
and it's very beautiful.

44:07.181 --> 44:08.282
It makes my heart beat.

44:08.315 --> 44:10.351
Wow. You do know your art.

44:10.384 --> 44:11.952
I'll give you that.

44:11.986 --> 44:13.354
Have you ever been to the MET?

44:13.387 --> 44:16.257
Um, yes, I have and it is,

44:16.290 --> 44:18.058
it's huge and you'll love it.

44:18.092 --> 44:22.329
It's filled with paintings
and statues of naked guys,

44:22.363 --> 44:25.733
- mostly with their... missing.
- Very funny.

44:25.766 --> 44:27.334
No, I'm serious.
It's the Catholic Church.

44:27.368 --> 44:29.970
They ordered in
the 4th century the removal of,

44:30.004 --> 44:31.872
all of the statues'...

44:33.073 --> 44:34.708
- Penises.
- Exactly.

44:34.742 --> 44:36.377
And there's actually,
there's a room somewhere.

44:36.410 --> 44:40.147
There's a vault in the MET
where all of these, you know.

44:40.181 --> 44:45.019
- Penises.
- Stone penises are meticulously cataloged and stored.

44:45.052 --> 44:48.189
I mean, can you, can you imagine
having to work there everyday?

44:49.957 --> 44:51.058
I can.

44:51.091 --> 44:52.293
I mean, it would be a dream.

44:53.227 --> 44:55.329
- Not in the penis vault.
- Oh, okay.

44:55.362 --> 44:57.731
But at the MET,
or the Guggenheim,

44:57.765 --> 45:00.234
or some other museum
in New York.

45:00.267 --> 45:02.803
It would be amazing.

45:02.836 --> 45:05.507
Well, tell you what.
If you come visit me,

45:05.540 --> 45:07.174
I'll take you
to all those places.

45:07.208 --> 45:08.309
Deal.

45:12.913 --> 45:15.149
<i>It's an accepted truth
that the birthplace of ice hockey</i>

45:15.182 --> 45:18.085
<i>is the frozen ponds of Canada,
but thousands of years prior,</i>

45:18.118 --> 45:21.155
<i>Vikings in Scandinavia invented
a game called Knattleikr</i>

45:21.188 --> 45:25.359
<i>played on thing ice. Players used sticks
to try to put a small ball into a goal.</i>

45:25.392 --> 45:29.330
<i>The game featured penalties,
penalty boxes, body contact, spectators,</i>

45:29.363 --> 45:31.533
<i>intimidation,
and probably verbally abusing</i>

45:31.566 --> 45:33.467
<i>whoever was officiating.</i>

45:33.501 --> 45:36.337
<i>It's knowing stuff like this
that keeps me from getting laid.</i>

45:37.871 --> 45:40.941
Hello. Where are you?
Are you there?

45:40.975 --> 45:43.410
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you thinking about hockey?

45:43.444 --> 45:47.047
Yeah, well, we are in
a, we're in a hockey rink so...

45:48.482 --> 45:50.184
Let's go somewhere else then.

45:56.591 --> 45:58.192
You still thinking about hockey?

45:59.426 --> 46:01.095
Hockey?

46:01.128 --> 46:02.396
I don't think I've
ever heard of hockey before.

46:02.429 --> 46:03.497
I don't know who that is.

46:04.999 --> 46:07.801
No, I was really thinking about how
I should probably call my girlfriend.

46:07.835 --> 46:09.970
I'm joking. I'm joking!

46:10.004 --> 46:11.071
It's a joke!

46:11.105 --> 46:13.040
Um, I was thinking about hair.

46:14.441 --> 46:15.876
Hair?
You're thinking about hair.

46:15.909 --> 46:17.244
For the next game.

46:17.278 --> 46:18.279
If I should slick it back

46:18.312 --> 46:19.446
or keep it natural or...

46:22.249 --> 46:24.985
So, where you off to next?

46:25.019 --> 46:27.855
Um... Kiruna.

46:27.888 --> 46:28.989
- Yeah?
- Kiruna.

46:29.023 --> 46:30.357
Kiruna. Um, which is north

46:30.391 --> 46:32.159
of the Arctic circle.

46:32.192 --> 46:34.361
No, I meant next season.

46:34.395 --> 46:35.530
Where are you going?

46:35.563 --> 46:38.098
Oh, Jesus. Um, Siberia I hope.

46:38.132 --> 46:39.501
Somewhere warmer than here.

46:42.537 --> 46:46.106
Oh, um, well,

46:46.140 --> 46:48.142
maybe I'll just hang out here
and hang out with the girl

46:48.175 --> 46:50.344
who works at the super market.
I don't know.

46:50.377 --> 46:52.279
- That's the answer I wanted.
- Mm-hmm.

46:52.313 --> 46:53.615
- Yeah?
- You can stay here.

46:53.648 --> 46:54.982
In this bed.

46:55.015 --> 46:56.216
For the rest of the season.

47:51.706 --> 47:54.108
<i>Countries change,
players come and go.</i>

47:54.141 --> 47:56.343
<i>Hell, even winning is temporary,</i>

47:56.377 --> 47:58.178
<i>but there is one constant</i>

47:58.212 --> 48:01.081
<i>we all take
great comfort in, McDonald's.</i>

48:02.216 --> 48:05.135
That'll be 2201 kronor, please.

48:05.166 --> 48:07.321
- They really love you on here.
- Who?

48:07.354 --> 48:09.423
The girls on the fan forum.

48:09.456 --> 48:12.560
- What do they say?
- Oh, well, this grade A bitch, wait.

48:13.727 --> 48:15.646
Good evening. Baltic Holidays.

48:15.729 --> 48:17.940
Mr.Dumaras speaking,
which places would you like to visit?

48:19.299 --> 48:20.467
- Firestick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

48:20.502 --> 48:22.302
Order from the Amazon,

48:22.336 --> 48:23.470
and do the jailbreak.

48:24.905 --> 48:28.242
- You know, how you watch for free so channels won't be suck?
- Mm-hmm.

48:28.275 --> 48:29.276
I show you.

48:30.244 --> 48:33.180
Thanks. So I says to her,
you may be a lady,

48:33.213 --> 48:35.949
but Gunther's
the hottest bitch in class.

48:35.983 --> 48:37.351
You know, cause
Gunther is a dog.

48:37.384 --> 48:38.686
- Yeah, I can see that.
- That's... right.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.555
There's nothing
funny about that. Sorry.

48:40.588 --> 48:42.423
Fuck it. Roos thinks I'm funny.

48:43.390 --> 48:45.325
Okay, who the fuck
drank my McFlurry?

48:45.359 --> 48:46.694
You don't drink McFlurry.

48:46.728 --> 48:48.696
You eat McFlurry, you idiot.

48:50.297 --> 48:51.365
Fucking Russians.

48:56.203 --> 48:57.971
Pay day, Roos.

48:58.005 --> 48:59.641
I scored tonight. Come on.

49:04.361 --> 49:05.195
What's up?

49:05.580 --> 49:06.947
<i>What's up?</i>

49:09.241 --> 49:10.075
How are you?

49:10.585 --> 49:11.553
<i>How are you?</i>

49:13.745 --> 49:15.414
Good game, shithead.

49:16.089 --> 49:17.725
<i>Good game, shithead.</i>

49:19.751 --> 49:20.836
Start...

49:34.809 --> 49:37.377
Well, the expression is
"lagom ar bast,"

49:37.411 --> 49:39.681
and "lagom" is a word
that means...

49:39.714 --> 49:41.381
- It's kind of hard to define.
- Mm-hmm.

49:41.415 --> 49:44.552
Um, but it means not
too much, not too little...

49:44.586 --> 49:46.721
Not too little,
just the right amount.

49:46.754 --> 49:49.223
But, it's not
like perfect either.

49:49.256 --> 49:50.558
- Right.
- It's kind of, anyway, so.

49:50.592 --> 49:52.326
Is it like Jante Law a little?

49:52.359 --> 49:54.361
- Is that how you say it? Jante Law?
- Jante Law?

49:54.394 --> 49:56.196
- Jante Law.
- Where'd you hear about Jante Law?

49:56.230 --> 49:58.666
Um, Gabbe told me
about it when he was here.

49:58.700 --> 50:00.434
Have you spoken to
him since he was cut?

50:00.467 --> 50:02.637
No, I actually haven't yet.

50:02.670 --> 50:04.539
But, um, um.

50:05.640 --> 50:07.509
- Oh, shit, it's Gabbe.
- Is it really Gabbe?

50:07.542 --> 50:09.443
No, it's not. Just kidding.
It's my little sister.

50:09.476 --> 50:11.144
- You want to, you want to say hi to her?
- Very funny.

50:11.178 --> 50:12.780
- Sure. Yeah.
- Okay.

50:12.814 --> 50:14.248
Hi, Claire!

50:14.281 --> 50:15.215
<i>What are you doing?</i>

50:15.249 --> 50:17.150
I am sitting on

50:17.184 --> 50:20.487
this big ass lake
with my friend Elin.

50:20.522 --> 50:22.389
Hi, Claire. Nice to meet you.

50:22.422 --> 50:23.457
<i>You too!</i>

50:24.592 --> 50:26.260
<i>She's so beautiful.
Why is she with you?</i>

50:26.293 --> 50:30.097
- Okay, what do you need, Claire?
- <i>Do you have any of your high school papers</i>

50:30.130 --> 50:33.200
<i>on</i> The Great Gatsby?
<i>We have a term paper due in two weeks.</i>

50:33.233 --> 50:34.736
I can see when I get home.
What's the topic?

50:34.769 --> 50:36.838
<i>I forget what it is exactly,</i>

50:36.871 --> 50:39.406
<i>but it's something to
do with the American dream.</i>

50:39.439 --> 50:42.376
Okay, I can see what
I can dig up on my computer.

50:42.409 --> 50:44.512
<i>Can you just please send me
whatever papers you have?</i>

50:44.546 --> 50:46.514
Yes, Claire!
Did you even read the book?

50:46.548 --> 50:49.851
<i>Yes, but I don't
really understand it.</i>

50:49.884 --> 50:51.686
Okay, well, um...

50:53.153 --> 50:56.524
it's like, it's like Gatsby's
reaching for something that's,

50:56.558 --> 50:58.258
that's already
behind him, right?

50:58.292 --> 50:59.661
<i>Please just send me
any papers you have.</i>

50:59.694 --> 51:01.729
I'll make sure he does.

51:01.763 --> 51:04.331
<i>Thanks, Elin!
Why are you with my brother?</i>

51:04.364 --> 51:07.167
Okay, thanks very much,
Claire. Thank you.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.503
She's so sweet. She's funny.

51:08.536 --> 51:10.237
- Oh, you think that was sweet?
- Yes.

51:10.270 --> 51:11.706
- I like that she makes fun of you.
- Okay.

51:11.739 --> 51:13.608
- You deserve it.
- Yes, yes.

51:13.641 --> 51:17.110
Well, I miss her. I actually
really do miss her sometimes.

51:17.144 --> 51:18.813
- I understand.
- Hmm.

51:18.846 --> 51:20.480
I think we should swim.
Should we have a swim?

51:20.515 --> 51:21.415
- Swimming?
- Yeah.

51:21.448 --> 51:23.150
Yeah, absolutely.

51:23.183 --> 51:25.252
We always went to swim
with our clothes on

51:25.285 --> 51:27.254
in Winter when we were children.

51:27.287 --> 51:29.557
They had to like, test
to see if we could stay afloat

51:29.591 --> 51:31.191
- if we accidentally fell in.
- Mm-hmm.

51:31.224 --> 51:32.426
Yeah, and then we sauna.

51:32.459 --> 51:34.194
So, we do like, in and out,

51:34.227 --> 51:36.363
- and then we roll around in the snow.
- Oh, okay.

51:36.396 --> 51:38.600
Do you want to go
inside and have a beer or something?

51:38.633 --> 51:40.334
Sure.

51:40.367 --> 51:41.703
Do you think
your family wishes you were more

51:41.736 --> 51:43.671
conventional
with your life choice?

51:43.705 --> 51:44.839
Conventional how?

51:46.507 --> 51:49.544
Get a stable job, like
a 9:00 to 5:00 kind of thing.

51:49.577 --> 51:52.647
Living in New York, having a
girlfriend, and all that kind of stuff.

51:52.680 --> 51:55.349
- Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
- That kind of thing.

51:55.382 --> 51:57.417
But, I mean,
I think that they're...

51:57.451 --> 51:58.820
I think that
they're pretty supportive.

51:58.853 --> 52:00.220
Whether they understand it

52:00.253 --> 52:02.389
completely is a different story.

52:02.422 --> 52:03.725
I mean, what about,
what about your folks?

52:03.758 --> 52:06.460
Do they, are they
supportive of your...

52:06.493 --> 52:08.529
artistic ambitions?

52:08.563 --> 52:10.765
- My dad was an artist so he's kind of thrilled...
- Oh, yeah?

52:10.798 --> 52:13.635
...that I'm doing the same thing
or that I'm interested in,

52:13.668 --> 52:16.537
- you know, his passion.
- What kind of an artist?

52:16.571 --> 52:19.507
- He worked with wood, mostly engraving.
- Mm-hmm.

52:19.540 --> 52:21.208
Well, what happened?
You said "was."

52:21.909 --> 52:23.845
- You happened?
- I happened.

52:23.878 --> 52:26.179
I think I came as
a bit of a surprise to them.

52:26.213 --> 52:30.250
I wasn't planned and, you know,
living the bohemian life

52:30.283 --> 52:32.920
in Stockholm in a small apartment
didn't really work with a baby,

52:32.954 --> 52:37.525
so we moved back here and, all
of a sudden,

52:37.558 --> 52:39.393
23 years have gone by
and here we are,

52:39.426 --> 52:41.395
and he's
a wood shop teacher now.

52:41.428 --> 52:44.599
Well, do you, do you ever,
do you think that he ever...

52:44.632 --> 52:47.835
you know, dreams
about what might have been?

52:49.971 --> 52:51.471
He probably, probably does.

52:51.506 --> 52:52.807
I think he's happy that

52:52.840 --> 52:54.542
he can live
vicariously through me.

52:55.777 --> 52:56.878
Um, yeah.

52:58.079 --> 53:00.347
What about you? Do you think
that you would be resentful

53:00.380 --> 53:03.818
if you had to stay in America
and not follow your dream?

53:05.318 --> 53:06.386
I'd like to say no.

53:09.524 --> 53:11.659
- Okay, well here's a question.
- What?

53:12.593 --> 53:14.662
- If you were to wake up tomorrow...
- Mm-hmm.

53:14.696 --> 53:15.963
...to the shocking realization

53:15.997 --> 53:18.566
that you
suddenly have three kids,

53:18.599 --> 53:21.201
and you had to put your whole life
on hold for obvious reasons...

53:23.504 --> 53:25.907
would you resent those kids?

53:31.378 --> 53:32.080
Guess I would, yeah.

53:33.581 --> 53:36.249
- Here's another question.
- Okay.

53:36.283 --> 53:37.719
Do you even want to have kids?

53:39.987 --> 53:42.255
- Is it terrible if I say no?
- No, it's not

53:42.289 --> 53:43.991
- terrible at all.
- Because I don't think I want kids at all.

53:44.025 --> 53:45.325
I just thought I had you pegged.

53:45.358 --> 53:48.295
Pegged as Swedish housewife.

53:48.328 --> 53:50.263
- No, no.
- Caring for her husband...

53:50.297 --> 53:51.632
- No, no, no. No, no.
- ...and her children,

53:51.666 --> 53:53.400
cooking cinnamon buns all day.

53:53.433 --> 53:55.368
Okay, okay, no, no.
I guess I realized

53:55.402 --> 53:57.004
I just don't really know you.
That's all.

53:59.439 --> 54:00.440
I guess you don't.

54:01.341 --> 54:03.310
- I'm Elin.
- Bobby.

54:03.343 --> 54:05.913
- Nice to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you, yes.

54:05.947 --> 54:07.247
- Finally.
- Yes.

54:08.916 --> 54:12.053
- Your dream is to go to the NHL?
- Yeah, something like that.

54:12.086 --> 54:14.622
What do you, what do you think
the odds are that you'll go there?

54:15.957 --> 54:19.827
Kind of not so great odd...
kind of terrible odds, actually.

54:21.629 --> 54:22.930
So why keep doing it?

54:25.700 --> 54:29.737
Okay, first thing I ever slept with
was a two piece aluminum stick.

54:29.771 --> 54:32.507
I got it for my seventh birthday.
I scored in three straight games.

54:32.540 --> 54:34.041
- I used it in Mike's. Yes.
- You talking about hockey?

54:34.075 --> 54:35.810
- We're still talking about hockey.
- Okay.

54:35.843 --> 54:37.578
- Okay.
- It's a really important thing to me.

54:37.612 --> 54:39.647
I think it's still in
my parent's house somewhere.

54:39.680 --> 54:41.649
I put it somewhere.
English, please.

54:41.682 --> 54:43.050
I need all the help that I can get.

54:43.084 --> 54:45.086
Thank you.
But yeah, I think it's still

54:45.119 --> 54:47.722
in my mom's apartment
somewhere. Anyway...

54:54.028 --> 54:56.631
Just when you think
they're about to fall apart!

54:56.664 --> 54:58.431
Ducks fly together!

54:58.465 --> 55:01.035
When the beer is warm
and the girls ain't pretty!

55:01.068 --> 55:03.104
Ducks fly together!

55:03.137 --> 55:05.940
When we're up by five
and there's ten minutes left!

55:05.973 --> 55:07.809
Ducks fly together!

55:07.842 --> 55:09.844
We all know that last one's
never happened boys.

55:09.877 --> 55:11.813
Let's get real.

55:11.846 --> 55:14.015
Conway is a defensive
liability every shift.

55:14.048 --> 55:15.783
Yeah, well, if Bombay put
him on a line with some

55:15.817 --> 55:17.585
play makers
rather than Connie Moreau,

55:17.618 --> 55:18.986
then maybe he
wouldn't feel the need to

55:19.020 --> 55:20.788
do everything himself.

55:20.822 --> 55:22.824
New movie!

55:22.857 --> 55:25.358
- We've seen this a hundred fucking times.
- Which way's the bus face?

55:32.166 --> 55:35.036
Hey, uh, what's
rule number three?

55:35.069 --> 55:38.072
- No shitting on the bus, Tomas.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it.

55:38.973 --> 55:41.609
I make the rules,
I can break the rules.

55:43.511 --> 55:44.579
Tak, Klas.

55:54.487 --> 55:55.923
You keep
playing how you did tonight,

55:55.957 --> 55:58.125
and I'm going to lose you
to that league, fuckface.

55:58.159 --> 56:00.795
Yeah, there's only two North American
imports for each team, right?

56:01.829 --> 56:03.564
Three when I played there.

56:04.999 --> 56:09.070
- When was that?
- Two seasons before the sharks signed me.

56:09.103 --> 56:10.004
San Jose?

56:11.038 --> 56:13.574
Hmm, I never played the show.

56:14.642 --> 56:16.878
Got to play in
Cleveland for their farm team.

56:19.013 --> 56:20.615
Did you... Oh, no, thank you.

56:20.648 --> 56:23.584
How long did you play
in Cleveland?

56:23.618 --> 56:24.518
Four weeks.

56:26.587 --> 56:28.155
Hurt my shoulder. Got cut.

56:29.657 --> 56:30.791
Came back to play here.

57:07.628 --> 57:10.497
All rise for
the honorable Judge Graybeard.

57:12.533 --> 57:14.035
Please be seated.

57:14.068 --> 57:16.837
- How do they plead?
- Guilty. All of them.

57:16.871 --> 57:19.941
Okay, let's, uh,
let's start with Gustav.

57:19.974 --> 57:22.076
50 Kronor for, uh,
stepping on the logo.

57:23.044 --> 57:26.847
Dumi, another phone call
in the locker room.

57:26.881 --> 57:28.249
Third offense, 100 Kronor.

57:28.282 --> 57:30.051
I get rebuttal?

57:30.084 --> 57:31.484
Not today.

57:31.519 --> 57:34.055
Then kiss my ass.

57:34.088 --> 57:34.989
Bobby.

57:36.223 --> 57:39.593
70 Kronor for, uh, snapping your
stick in the equipment room.

57:39.627 --> 57:41.062
I got docked
for that last paycheck.

57:41.095 --> 57:43.698
Twice the amount for rebuttal.

57:43.731 --> 57:44.999
That's 140 Kronor.

57:45.933 --> 57:47.635
- Dean.
- Hmm.

57:47.668 --> 57:49.770
- 50 Kronor for that haircut.
- Make it 100.

57:49.804 --> 57:51.539
No one should look this good.

57:51.572 --> 57:52.873
Hey, I got one.

57:52.907 --> 57:53.975
It's on Roos.

57:55.242 --> 57:57.144
He told Elin I have the worst
shootout moves in all of Sweden.

57:58.312 --> 58:01.867
- What do you say, Roos? Is it true?
- Absolutely.

58:04.685 --> 58:05.953
I guess that's it.

58:05.987 --> 58:07.621
Court is adjourned.
You may finish

58:07.655 --> 58:09.023
preparations for practice.

58:09.056 --> 58:11.025
Ah, please roll me out.

58:11.058 --> 58:13.828
Klas, you look
like Oreo without cookie.

58:13.861 --> 58:15.896
- Yeah, double stuffed.
- Rookie, let's go.

58:15.930 --> 58:16.931
Wheel him out.

58:19.633 --> 58:21.168
All right, I'm going
to need you, need you

58:21.202 --> 58:23.170
to give me some help
with some simple math here.

58:24.905 --> 58:27.208
You're assuming
a lot on my behalf.

58:27.241 --> 58:29.310
Do you carry
the one or is that, uh...

58:29.343 --> 58:31.946
Well, first of all,
court is spelled with a "U."

58:31.979 --> 58:33.247
Yeah.

58:33.280 --> 58:34.749
Is that wrong?

58:34.782 --> 58:35.983
- We'll figure it out.
- Okay.

58:43.624 --> 58:46.627
Ooo. Money money.

58:46.660 --> 58:49.263
You're going to look dashing
with that mustache, Bobby.

58:49.296 --> 58:50.931
No pressure.

58:50.965 --> 58:52.933
<i>Okay, if I miss this,</i>

58:52.967 --> 58:54.635
<i>it's my turn to grow a mustache.</i>

58:55.870 --> 58:57.571
<i>Shit.</i>

58:57.605 --> 58:59.173
<i>I don't know if
I can even grow a mustache.</i>

59:04.912 --> 59:06.981
<i>Maybe I should go
Gunner Stall on this one.</i>

59:08.015 --> 59:10.651
<i>Triple deek, hi-glove.
You know, I like to get fancy.</i>

59:12.119 --> 59:16.323
<i>Man, Dumi has a good fucking
command of the English language.</i>

59:16.357 --> 59:17.925
<i>I should hang out with him more.</i>

59:19.126 --> 59:20.795
<i>Triple deek?</i>

59:20.828 --> 59:23.030
<i>That's one of the dumbest ideas
I've ever had.</i>

59:23.064 --> 59:25.032
<i>I can't believe
that entered my mind.</i>

59:25.066 --> 59:28.936
<i>Plus, didn't Julie
the cat stone Gunner in D2?</i>

59:28.969 --> 59:32.173
<i>Wait, why the hell does Gunner do
a full stop after the triple deek?</i>

59:32.206 --> 59:34.208
<i>That completely
negates the purpose of it.</i>

59:35.276 --> 59:36.077
<i>Just shoot the fucking puck.</i>

59:37.978 --> 59:40.681
- Nice dump in, Sanders!
- Oh!

59:43.651 --> 59:44.685
Goal line.

59:54.128 --> 59:55.229
Bobby, you okay?

01:00:01.235 --> 01:00:03.704
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm good.
- You okay?

01:00:05.063 --> 01:00:07.733
Okay, guys, that's it for today.

01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:14.949
Yeah, right.

01:00:16.183 --> 01:00:17.084
Yeah.

01:00:17.576 --> 01:00:19.203
What do you think? Is it bad?

01:00:20.495 --> 01:00:23.040
I want to do an MRI.

01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:26.335
Too much swelling to know for sure,

01:00:26.418 --> 01:00:28.504
but there's nothing wrong
with the range of motion.

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:31.265
Could be
just a pulled hamstring,

01:00:31.298 --> 01:00:34.101
- but, uh, we'll do an MRI to be safe.
- Sure.

01:00:34.135 --> 01:00:35.336
It's open.

01:00:35.369 --> 01:00:37.905
I got some
really good news.

01:00:37.938 --> 01:00:41.242
Hey, Elin, this Dr. Svensson
and you know coach Tomas.

01:00:42.267 --> 01:00:44.019
- Nice to meet you, I'm Elin.
- You too.

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:45.913
- Hi, Tomas.
- Elin.

01:00:45.946 --> 01:00:47.248
Is everything okay here?

01:00:47.281 --> 01:00:48.916
I just, I tweaked
my hamstring at practice

01:00:48.949 --> 01:00:50.184
a little bit,
but it's not a big deal.

01:00:51.285 --> 01:00:54.221
Take two of these
with every meal, and, uh,

01:00:54.255 --> 01:00:57.791
- ice it every 20 minutes and keep it elevated.
- Okay.

01:00:57.825 --> 01:00:59.994
I'll get the MRI scheduled
first thing on Monday.

01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:02.496
Very good. Thanks.

01:01:03.197 --> 01:01:04.798
Thanks for coming by, Tomas.

01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:06.734
Yup.

01:01:10.304 --> 01:01:11.272
You get some rest.

01:01:14.383 --> 01:01:15.509
He should rest.

01:01:16.134 --> 01:01:16.969
Okay.

01:01:17.553 --> 01:01:19.012
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:01:22.082 --> 01:01:23.484
An MRI?
That sounds kind of serious.

01:01:23.518 --> 01:01:25.719
No, it'll be all right.

01:01:25.753 --> 01:01:26.787
You sure?

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:27.855
Yeah.

01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:31.458
Um, what's the good news?

01:01:31.492 --> 01:01:34.295
Oh, um, nothing.

01:01:34.328 --> 01:01:36.430
- Nothing. Silly.
- Well, now it's mysterious.

01:01:36.463 --> 01:01:38.299
It was nothing.
I was trying to make a joke.

01:01:38.332 --> 01:01:41.035
- It was nothing. I promise.
- Okay.

01:01:44.805 --> 01:01:47.808
Roberto, what's shaking, playa?
Want to play NHL?

01:01:47.841 --> 01:01:48.809
<i>Nah.</i>

01:01:49.944 --> 01:01:51.946
<i>I fucked up my hamstring
at practice today.</i>

01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:53.981
- Bad?
- <i>I don't think so.</i>

01:01:54.014 --> 01:01:55.482
Anything to do with the back?

01:01:55.517 --> 01:01:58.419
I have an MRI
Monday to see what the deal is.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.990
Hey, why'd they, uh, scratch you
from last night's line up?

01:02:03.023 --> 01:02:05.527
Uh, Pittsburgh traded me,
man, to the Rangers.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.727
Coming home.

01:02:08.796 --> 01:02:11.198
Dude, that's pretty sick.
Playing in the Garden?

01:02:11.232 --> 01:02:12.766
<i>Oh, please, man. Come on.</i>

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.368
You're the one
with Swedish girlfriend

01:02:14.401 --> 01:02:16.470
and guys that actually
play video games on your team.

01:02:16.504 --> 01:02:18.105
<i>All the young guys here
are Russian.</i>

01:02:18.138 --> 01:02:19.340
<i>They don't give
a shit about vids.</i>

01:02:19.373 --> 01:02:21.509
And the older guys, they suck.

01:02:21.543 --> 01:02:24.378
So, I'm stuck playing with
the captain's ten-year old kid,

01:02:24.411 --> 01:02:26.814
and that little shit uses
all these bullshit cheat codes,

01:02:26.847 --> 01:02:28.215
so it's either that or playing

01:02:28.249 --> 01:02:30.150
fucking campaign
mode on <i>Call of Duty.</i>

01:02:30.184 --> 01:02:32.152
Ah, that's still pretty sick.

01:02:32.186 --> 01:02:33.921
Being in New York
I'm sure will be better.

01:02:35.256 --> 01:02:36.857
I heard Michelle Hull's
moving back.

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:38.225
<i>What?</i>

01:02:38.259 --> 01:02:39.493
Remember
you took her roommate out

01:02:39.527 --> 01:02:40.995
sophomore year
and ended the date

01:02:41.028 --> 01:02:42.162
by kissing her on the forehead?

01:02:42.196 --> 01:02:43.330
<i>Dude, she had mono.</i>

01:02:43.364 --> 01:02:45.099
<i>Yeah, freshman year, brother.</i>

01:02:45.132 --> 01:02:46.433
<i>You got the squarest
wheels in the league.</i>

01:02:46.467 --> 01:02:48.102
That shit... it's contagious.

01:02:48.135 --> 01:02:49.537
They can be
dormant for over a year.

01:02:49.571 --> 01:02:52.106
- I don't... whatever.
- <i>All right, look.</i>

01:02:52.139 --> 01:02:54.174
<i>If your leg falls off and need
to come back to New York,</i>

01:02:54.208 --> 01:02:56.243
<i>Macker can probably get you
a look at Goldman's.</i>

01:02:56.277 --> 01:02:58.912
<i>Yeah, who hires a leprechaun
to guard their gold.</i>

01:02:58.946 --> 01:03:01.315
Exactly, plus I'll
have an extra bedroom.

01:03:01.348 --> 01:03:02.883
I'll send you a link
to this place I found.

01:03:02.916 --> 01:03:04.586
Tribeca, no broker fee.

01:03:04.619 --> 01:03:06.854
Oh, and I got the new
<i>Call of Duty: Black Ops.</i>

01:03:06.887 --> 01:03:08.322
I'll hit you later, Sully.

01:03:08.355 --> 01:03:10.190
All right, brother.
I'll talk to you later.

01:03:15.896 --> 01:03:17.398
Well, no sign of a tear.

01:03:17.431 --> 01:03:19.833
Thank fucking God.

01:03:19.867 --> 01:03:22.202
But, we can't rule out
a recurring problem.

01:03:22.236 --> 01:03:24.138
Now, this could be the result

01:03:24.171 --> 01:03:27.074
of your body overcompensating
for your previous injury.

01:03:28.142 --> 01:03:32.514
Now if this is the case, and you continue
to play, it could be a great risk.

01:03:33.581 --> 01:03:37.418
Okay, um,
but if it's not the case,

01:03:37.451 --> 01:03:39.320
and it's
just a pulled hamstring...

01:03:40.555 --> 01:03:42.923
I mean, how long you think
until I can get back on the ice?

01:03:42.956 --> 01:03:46.360
You'll miss three games,
maybe four maximum.

01:03:47.361 --> 01:03:48.996
Think we could tell Tomas three?

01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:51.098
Don't worry about that bastard.

01:03:51.131 --> 01:03:54.401
He'll understand, but I will
tell him three just in case.

01:03:54.435 --> 01:03:56.136
Thank you very much.

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:57.838
So um, how long have
you guys known each other?

01:03:58.906 --> 01:04:02.109
Oh, um, classmates as kids,

01:04:02.142 --> 01:04:05.145
and we've been
friends now maybe 20 years.

01:04:05.179 --> 01:04:09.416
Wow. So, what's the deal
with the, uh, shoulder then?

01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:11.352
- Shoulder?
- Yeah, you know.

01:04:11.385 --> 01:04:12.853
He played in Cleveland.

01:04:13.555 --> 01:04:15.022
Injured his shoulder.

01:04:15.055 --> 01:04:16.524
Had to quit, come home.

01:04:16.558 --> 01:04:19.093
He stopped playing
because of his goddaughter.

01:04:19.126 --> 01:04:21.462
She has
the same problem as Roos.

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:24.865
He came home to
take care of her.

01:04:27.334 --> 01:04:29.103
All right, Bobby.

01:04:29.136 --> 01:04:31.338
- Take it easy out there.
- Yeah. Thanks very much, doctor.

01:04:42.717 --> 01:04:44.184
Thanks for the lift, pal.

01:04:44.218 --> 01:04:45.587
Uber's dog shit out here.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:47.421
Yeah, how'd it go?

01:04:47.454 --> 01:04:50.424
Uh, bullshit automatic shuffler.

01:04:50.457 --> 01:04:52.960
Well, you got to play
the cards you're dealt, buddy.

01:04:52.993 --> 01:04:55.295
Yeah?
You play the cards you're dealt,

01:04:55.329 --> 01:04:57.164
they'll butt
fuck you half the time.

01:04:57.197 --> 01:04:59.466
- I thought you were good.
- I am.

01:04:59.501 --> 01:05:02.903
However, the key is
knowing when to fold.

01:05:03.671 --> 01:05:06.574
Oh, yes, Kenny Rogers?
And how do you know when to fold?

01:05:06.608 --> 01:05:09.644
Well, if I knew that,
I probably wouldn't be here, would I?

01:05:09.677 --> 01:05:12.379
I'd be yucking it up at
the final table with Phil Ivey.

01:05:14.081 --> 01:05:17.585
You want to know when to fold? You play
enough hands, you figure it out for yourself.

01:05:21.155 --> 01:05:22.322
There she is.

01:05:22.356 --> 01:05:24.626
- Who?
- Rebecca.

01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:26.594
My home game muse.

01:05:26.628 --> 01:05:29.096
She, uh, looking to
play a little double dutch?

01:05:29.129 --> 01:05:30.532
Yeah, she wants me to serve

01:05:30.565 --> 01:05:32.534
a five minute major
in her penalty box, baby.

01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:36.671
Do we play home this weekend
or are we on the road?

01:05:36.704 --> 01:05:39.106
We are away.

01:05:40.307 --> 01:05:41.609
Fuck.

01:05:41.643 --> 01:05:43.277
You going to save
that sucker to drafts?

01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:44.211
Yeah.

01:05:45.179 --> 01:05:46.614
Can't fuck with tradition.

01:05:46.648 --> 01:05:48.550
Hey, yeah, she
actually kind of reminds me

01:05:48.583 --> 01:05:50.685
of, um, a girl from college.

01:05:50.718 --> 01:05:52.319
Was she hot?

01:05:52.352 --> 01:05:54.388
- Yeah, sh-
- Okay, so stop right there.

01:05:54.421 --> 01:05:56.023
Just think
the story through first.

01:05:56.056 --> 01:05:58.626
The timing and shit like that.
You know.

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:00.461
Fuck you.

01:06:03.397 --> 01:06:06.133
Hey, you ever,
you ever thought about

01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:08.469
what you might do after hockey?

01:06:08.503 --> 01:06:10.505
Yeah, I got an idea.

01:06:10.538 --> 01:06:12.306
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:06:12.339 --> 01:06:14.509
No joke, it's
like a trillion dollar idea.

01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:17.377
And if that doesn't work out,

01:06:17.411 --> 01:06:18.713
I'll probably
be a cop back home.

01:06:20.648 --> 01:06:23.450
So, what's the idea?

01:06:23.484 --> 01:06:25.185
Yeah, right.
You think I'm going to tell you

01:06:25.219 --> 01:06:27.120
and let you steal it
like those robot douche bags

01:06:27.154 --> 01:06:29.056
took Eisenberg's Facebook.

01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:30.390
Keep dreaming, buddy.

01:06:34.294 --> 01:06:35.295
I mean...

01:06:37.765 --> 01:06:41.134
truthfully, I think next season
will probably be my last one.

01:06:41.168 --> 01:06:43.605
Because you know,
there's a point in hockey

01:06:43.638 --> 01:06:45.740
when you go
from prospect to suspect,

01:06:45.773 --> 01:06:47.609
and even the police academy's

01:06:47.642 --> 01:06:49.376
got an age limit
for consideration.

01:06:49.409 --> 01:06:53.113
So, I figured I'd make the call

01:06:53.146 --> 01:06:55.115
before the hockey gods do.

01:06:55.148 --> 01:06:56.149
What about you?

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.153
It's like, you do
something long enough,

01:07:00.187 --> 01:07:03.457
you kind of don't know
what you'd be without it.

01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:05.359
Yeah, well, maybe you find out

01:07:05.392 --> 01:07:07.427
who you are by first
finding out who you're not.

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:14.569
Oh, shit, check it out.

01:07:14.602 --> 01:07:16.103
What the fuck is that?

01:07:16.136 --> 01:07:17.672
I think it's
the northern lights.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.073
How does that happen?

01:07:20.107 --> 01:07:22.677
Mm, negatively charged ions

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:24.779
near the poles
or something like that.

01:07:25.847 --> 01:07:26.748
Easy, Harvard.

01:07:29.216 --> 01:07:30.652
Well, it has to be a good sign.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.137

Hey, nice fanny duster, brother.

01:08:08.155 --> 01:08:10.290
Hello, hello, this is Dumas.

01:08:10.324 --> 01:08:12.326
Yes, it's two hours to Vilnis.

01:08:12.359 --> 01:08:15.563
Only five minutes walk
to world famous Pussy Lounge.

01:08:15.597 --> 01:08:18.231
What are you doing, brother?
Are you booking a vacation? What is it?

01:08:18.265 --> 01:08:19.366
Sorry, please hold. Please hold.

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:21.234
No, no, no, no, no, I have, um,

01:08:21.268 --> 01:08:23.203
Air BNB's. American's love them.

01:08:23.236 --> 01:08:24.404
I have like six of them.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:29.475
Yeah, sorry. Sorry, I, uh,
have, uh, I'm in the club.

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:31.578
- It's very loud.
- That's bullshit. You do it on an app.

01:08:31.613 --> 01:08:32.714
Why is he on the phone?

01:08:33.715 --> 01:08:36.651
Hustling all day, every day.

01:08:36.684 --> 01:08:38.685
Fellas. Sorry I'm late, boys.

01:08:40.854 --> 01:08:44.524
Hey, so how's the, um,
how's the Rebecca situation?

01:08:44.559 --> 01:08:45.660
Home game muse.

01:08:45.693 --> 01:08:47.629
High maintenance as usual.

01:08:47.662 --> 01:08:49.261
Couldn't get out
of my room this morning.

01:08:49.296 --> 01:08:51.331
Told her we had practice.
She wanted to watch,

01:08:51.365 --> 01:08:53.501
so I had to
audible an off ice workout,

01:08:53.533 --> 01:08:54.801
hence the whole headband and...

01:08:54.836 --> 01:08:56.604
Jesus Christ.

01:08:56.638 --> 01:09:00.240
She did however,
show me the uh... Roganverdon?

01:09:00.273 --> 01:09:02.209
Oy, oy, oy, wheelbarrow.

01:09:02.242 --> 01:09:04.712
I love this one.
Yeah, it's nice.

01:09:04.746 --> 01:09:07.481
So, what's the, what's the Roganverdon?
What's the verdict on that?

01:09:07.515 --> 01:09:09.216
I wouldn't do it
with a pulled hamstring.

01:09:09.249 --> 01:09:12.452
- No?
- Yeah, yeah, we will need a spotter.

01:09:12.486 --> 01:09:14.555
What's this?

01:09:14.589 --> 01:09:16.557
It's an '82. It's good.
You sip it slow.

01:09:16.591 --> 01:09:17.925
It gets you drunk fast.

01:09:17.959 --> 01:09:19.594
No, no, no, no, no.
I... what the fuck?

01:09:19.627 --> 01:09:21.629
- I don't drink this shit!
- You'll drink horse piss,

01:09:21.662 --> 01:09:23.531
but you won't
drink delicious box wine?

01:09:23.564 --> 01:09:25.966
What's wrong with you?
Fucking Russian.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.268
- I'm Latvian!
- Whatever.

01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:30.270
<i>In NHL action,
the New York Rangers</i>

01:09:30.303 --> 01:09:32.471
<i>defeated Florida Panthers

01:09:33.372 --> 01:09:35.408

<i>In local news, band legend...</i>

01:09:42.015 --> 01:09:45.787
Hey, you ever
thought about, you know,

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:47.654
what it might be like, you know,

01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:50.625
if you were, if you were better?

01:09:54.595 --> 01:09:58.966
Ah, in Latvia, my grandfather
always tells me...

01:10:00.702 --> 01:10:04.337
"It's better to have the sparrow

01:10:04.371 --> 01:10:08.275
in the hand than
the pigeon on the rooftop."

01:10:09.911 --> 01:10:10.778
Yeah.

01:10:11.846 --> 01:10:13.881
I literally have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:10:13.915 --> 01:10:17.819
It means
what you have in the hands

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.756
could be what you're
looking for in the skies.

01:10:25.893 --> 01:10:26.794
What do you see?

01:10:27.929 --> 01:10:30.732
Yeah, yes. I understand
glass half full perspective.

01:10:30.765 --> 01:10:31.833
Thank you very much, Ragge.

01:10:31.866 --> 01:10:33.568
That's great. Thank you.

01:10:33.601 --> 01:10:36.236
If I was in the NHL right now...

01:10:38.005 --> 01:10:43.010
I would be having
drink at bar, yeah?

01:10:43.044 --> 01:10:45.513
Celebrating you had good game.

01:10:46.948 --> 01:10:49.016
Sharing drink with teammate.

01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:50.718
What is this?

01:10:52.754 --> 01:10:54.856
Try it. Yeah?

01:11:01.461 --> 01:11:02.530
Latvian vodka.

01:11:02.563 --> 01:11:03.865
Make Russian vodka

01:11:03.898 --> 01:11:05.499
look like baby juice.

01:11:05.533 --> 01:11:06.466
That stings.

01:11:06.501 --> 01:11:07.902
Oh, my nose.

01:11:07.935 --> 01:11:08.903
Hey, guys.

01:11:08.936 --> 01:11:10.772
All right.

01:11:10.805 --> 01:11:12.472
Hi!

01:11:12.507 --> 01:11:13.908
- Drink?
- Yes, please.

01:11:13.941 --> 01:11:15.576
- This for me?
- Yeah.

01:11:16.318 --> 01:11:17.402
Cheers!

01:11:17.903 --> 01:11:19.446
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:11:19.914 --> 01:11:23.017
- Here's to you getting back out on the ice where you belong.
- Cheers.

01:11:25.744 --> 01:11:28.872
Kumla breaks through, two to one, goal!

01:11:29.289 --> 01:11:31.777
He put Kumla first on the leaderboard!

01:11:31.839 --> 01:11:34.595
Hey, did you,
did you know that coach Tomas,

01:11:34.629 --> 01:11:36.531
he, he played for Kumla?

01:11:38.766 --> 01:11:40.935
Of course, dude.
They retired his jersey

01:11:40.968 --> 01:11:42.469
in ceremony last year.

01:11:44.705 --> 01:11:47.909
See, that's bullshit. How the hell is
turnstile Tony still in that league?

01:11:47.942 --> 01:11:50.011
I don't understand why
they take guys like that.

01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:51.512
I don't know, man.
He's got a pretty good shot.

01:11:51.546 --> 01:11:52.814
Wasn't he like
a Devils draft pick

01:11:52.847 --> 01:11:53.848
- a couple years ago?
- Does not matter.

01:11:53.881 --> 01:11:54.916
He's not good at hockey.

01:11:54.949 --> 01:11:56.416
He can't skate backwards and

01:11:56.449 --> 01:11:58.753
he fumble fucks backhand passes.
He's bad.

01:11:58.786 --> 01:12:01.454
Okay, well this is starting to
sound a little bit personal here.

01:12:01.488 --> 01:12:03.691
What's your problem
with fumble fuck Tony?

01:12:03.724 --> 01:12:05.893
I don't like him because he took
my spot on the national team.

01:12:05.927 --> 01:12:08.361
You weren't going to
make the national team.

01:12:08.395 --> 01:12:10.064
- I could have made the national team.
- No, shut up.

01:12:10.097 --> 01:12:12.465
No, you must play
like ferret in kiddie pool

01:12:12.499 --> 01:12:13.801
to be on national team.

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:26.781
Here you go.

01:12:27.815 --> 01:12:29.650
- Thanks.
- Oh, one more.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.514
I don't why I didn't tell him.

01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:04.886
Guess I'm no better
at goodbyes than he is.

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.875
I don't know. Still seems
kind of fucked up though.

01:13:27.909 --> 01:13:30.077
Yeah, I probably
should have seen it coming.

01:13:30.111 --> 01:13:33.648
To be honest,
I kind of respect her for it.

01:13:33.681 --> 01:13:36.651
Yeah, well... you were probably

01:13:36.684 --> 01:13:39.553
going to leave her in the dust at
the end of the season anyhow, so...

01:13:39.587 --> 01:13:40.922
Yeah.

01:13:40.955 --> 01:13:42.924
Hey, want to play NHL?

01:13:42.957 --> 01:13:45.793
Can't do it, buddy.
Poker tourney starts in five.

01:13:45.826 --> 01:13:48.863
- Got to pay rent, you know?
- Okay, brother.

01:13:48.896 --> 01:13:50.097
- See you in the morning.
- Later.

01:14:51.892 --> 01:14:53.627
<i>Sometimes I feel
like it's not</i>

01:14:53.661 --> 01:14:55.563
<i>a reality I'm living in.</i>

01:14:57.264 --> 01:14:59.200
<i>The game
requires and unrelenting,</i>

01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:01.936
<i>alienating self-absorption.</i>

01:15:01.969 --> 01:15:03.637
<i>Maybe that's just how I see it.</i>

01:15:05.306 --> 01:15:07.675
<i>When was the last time I had a
conversation that didn't revolve</i>

01:15:07.708 --> 01:15:09.210
<i>around me and hockey?</i>

01:15:10.878 --> 01:15:13.280
<i>It's like I'm on
this delusional journey.</i>

01:15:13.314 --> 01:15:17.585
<i>All these people around me are the
extras and the places just pit stops.</i>

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.689
<i>Is this all
just another memory for me</i>

01:15:21.722 --> 01:15:23.958
<i>to tuck away,
never to return to?</i>

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.097
<i>Maybe this is the dream, and
I've been missing it all along.</i>

01:15:51.085 --> 01:15:53.187
<i>Spring is
just around the corner,</i>

01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:56.924
<i>which means desperation time
in the European minor leagues.</i>

01:15:56.957 --> 01:15:59.093
<i>Some guys desperate
to make the playoffs...</i>

01:16:00.094 --> 01:16:01.829
<i>others desperate
to go to Thailand.</i>

01:16:04.732 --> 01:16:06.167
The season's pretty much done.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.702
Mathematically
eliminated from the playoffs.

01:16:08.736 --> 01:16:11.038
Once the regular season's over,

01:16:11.072 --> 01:16:13.174
some guys will say goodbye.

01:16:13.207 --> 01:16:15.009
Most guys won't.

01:16:15.042 --> 01:16:17.611
Nearly everyone
will end up here,

01:16:17.645 --> 01:16:19.814
raiding the equipment room,

01:16:19.847 --> 01:16:21.682
stealing extra
gear for the summer.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.122
- You got that?
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

01:16:28.155 --> 01:16:29.123
Hold on. One second.

01:17:08.129 --> 01:17:10.231
- You hear back from Tomas yet?
- No.

01:17:11.966 --> 01:17:14.902
It doesn't make any sense. I don't know
why'd they cut the leading goal scorer.

01:17:14.935 --> 01:17:16.303
It makes all
the sense in the world, man.

01:17:16.337 --> 01:17:18.038
Four throw away games left,

01:17:18.072 --> 01:17:19.406
they save money
by cutting me now.

01:17:21.108 --> 01:17:22.009
Yeah.

01:17:26.747 --> 01:17:28.749
Hey, need your help.

01:17:31.185 --> 01:17:32.086
And grab a twig.

01:17:40.261 --> 01:17:41.328
All right.

01:17:46.901 --> 01:17:48.802
Yeah. You give me that?

01:17:53.874 --> 01:17:54.909
All right.

01:17:57.044 --> 01:17:58.779
So what's the game plan?

01:17:58.812 --> 01:18:01.448
Uh, my good buddy Sully's
playing

01:18:01.482 --> 01:18:03.751
in New York for the Rangers,

01:18:03.784 --> 01:18:07.855
so I was thinking I might,
yeah, stay with him.

01:18:07.888 --> 01:18:09.924
Yeah? That or track down Elin.

01:18:09.957 --> 01:18:11.225
Yeah, maybe.

01:18:12.326 --> 01:18:13.294
Snap a pic.

01:18:15.162 --> 01:18:17.131
Wait, wait, wait,
how's the salad look?

01:18:17.164 --> 01:18:18.232
- Brutal.
- Sick.

01:18:18.265 --> 01:18:19.366
Take a step to you right.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.968
- Yeah?
- Your other right.

01:18:27.174 --> 01:18:28.442
Hey, fuckface.

01:18:30.978 --> 01:18:32.746
I wouldn't retire that just yet.

01:18:35.015 --> 01:18:36.417
Kumla called.

01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:38.052
They want you in
their lineup tonight.

01:18:48.796 --> 01:18:49.496
Hey.

01:19:11.852 --> 01:19:15.789
<i>Dear me, I
hope you find something you love</i>

01:19:15.823 --> 01:19:17.191
<i>as much as I love hockey.</i>
