WEBVTT

00:17.643 --> 00:20.354
Does everyone have turnip chips?

00:20.521 --> 00:21.480
THE RETURN OF THE ELFKINS

00:21.647 --> 00:23.440
Be quiet!

00:24.566 --> 00:25.609
That was my foot!

00:26.568 --> 00:28.570
I can't wait to see this.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.573
It's starting.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.534
Welcome, dear friends,

00:33.700 --> 00:36.495
to this year's Elfkin Festival.

00:36.662 --> 00:40.415
Like every year,
the first performance will be...

00:40.582 --> 00:41.500
Vendla!

00:41.667 --> 00:43.585
Could we wait just a moment?

00:43.752 --> 00:45.546
Elfie is missing.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.423
We'll start without her.

00:48.590 --> 00:52.386
We're about to hear the famous legend
of our ancestors:

00:52.553 --> 00:54.471
the Elfkins of Cologne!

00:56.473 --> 00:58.517
In old Cologne, in times long gone,

00:58.684 --> 01:00.602
the Elfkins helped things move along.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.522
The lazy man would think it best

01:03.689 --> 01:06.483
to just lie down and get some rest.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.527
Then late at night...

01:08.694 --> 01:09.695
Dratted hat!

01:10.487 --> 01:11.572
I can't see a thing.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.574
Sorry!

01:13.740 --> 01:15.617
I just wanted to check our set.

01:16.535 --> 01:17.703
The show will go on in a moment.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.709
Where was I?

01:24.501 --> 01:25.586
"Then late at night..."

01:25.752 --> 01:28.589
Then late at night they would appear

01:28.755 --> 01:31.508
and start their secret work with cheer.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.595
They swarmed around with tools in hand

01:34.761 --> 01:38.557
And combed and cawed
and sewed and sawed.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.642
The lazy bones, back on his feet,

01:40.809 --> 01:42.686
would find his daily work complete!

01:44.771 --> 01:46.648
It's a lovely story.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.568
But does it have a happy ending?

01:50.652 --> 01:51.612
No!

01:51.778 --> 01:54.489
One day, a tailor found himself in a plight:

01:54.656 --> 01:56.617
Finish the mayor's frock overnight.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.661
They crept up to the sewing stand

01:59.828 --> 02:02.581
and cut and darned and sewed by hand.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.750
Backstitch, topstitch, slipstitch...

02:05.626 --> 02:07.753
Before the tailor had finished dreaming,

02:08.587 --> 02:11.632
the frock was ready, neat and gleaming.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.637
It's trendy.
People wear it like this now.

02:17.763 --> 02:22.601
But the hard-working Elfkins
were never properly thanked.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.604
Enter Kipp.
Big hat, tiny brain.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.689
The nosy tailor's wife

02:27.856 --> 02:30.734
wanted to see the helpers
with her own eyes,

02:32.736 --> 02:35.697
so she scattered peas across the floor.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.575
Poor, tireless Elfkins.

02:38.742 --> 02:42.621
They stumbled, slipped and crashed
down the basement stairs.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.791
No one ever saw them again.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.544
The humans haven't stopped complaining since:

02:49.711 --> 02:51.797
"We'd turn back time if we only could."

02:52.589 --> 02:55.676
But those carefree days
are gone for good.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.596
The script says
you fall down the steps too.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.765
Over my dead body.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.602
Missed me, dummy!

03:06.728 --> 03:08.730
Unbelievable! Just you wait.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.818
I've had enough.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.614
No panties.

03:17.781 --> 03:18.782
You show her, Elfie!

03:21.827 --> 03:23.704
That's all you've got?

03:24.705 --> 03:25.789
Attack!

03:28.792 --> 03:30.794
Looks like she needs a hand.

03:43.765 --> 03:44.850
I'm the hero of this story!

03:45.684 --> 03:46.810
Not this time.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.689
Now listen up:
Elfkins can't be pushed around.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.774
Be nice to us, and we'll be nice back.

03:52.941 --> 03:53.859
Well said!

03:54.693 --> 03:57.696
That's nothing to applaud.
Humans are simply unkind.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.657
How do you know?
You've never met one.

04:00.824 --> 04:04.661
But I know the legend.
Humans are mean and ungrateful.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.621
And much too big.

04:06.788 --> 04:10.667
For generations,
we've lived in peace down here.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.712
True, but it's gloomy and snoring-boring.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.673
And cramped.
- No, it's not.

04:16.840 --> 04:17.674
I like it here.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.676
Vendla's right, Elfie.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.888
Everyone here can fulfill the Elfkin mission
their own way.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.806
And what's our mission?

04:25.807 --> 04:27.768
Mastering a handicraft.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.687
Which handicraft have you mastered?

04:30.854 --> 04:34.816
You'll see! This year,
I'll win something in the Hat Competition.

04:34.983 --> 04:39.738
Your attempts at learning a craft
have failed miserably so far.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.666
That's why your hat
is the smallest and tattiest of all.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.668
That's not going to change.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.880
It will soon,
because my ideas are Elfienesque!

05:04.805 --> 05:07.808
And now to the highlight of our celebration:

05:08.809 --> 05:10.769
The Hat Competition.

05:10.936 --> 05:14.773
You can pack up your things.
I'm getting the hat.

05:14.940 --> 05:15.816
I think Urgi will win.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.819
Alfy made a toothbrush
that's also a shoe brush.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.695
But that's pointless.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.823
So, what do we have here?

05:22.989 --> 05:25.784
A turnip basket. Very good.

05:26.785 --> 05:30.747
I dyed them mud brown
so you can't see the dirt.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.833
What a practical idea, Ada.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.711
Ouch! Hats above!
- Very nice.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.797
Kipp, what have you made this time?

05:38.964 --> 05:39.923
A chair.

05:40.799 --> 05:41.842
Nicely done.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.802
The woodworking is perfect.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.720
It's no ordinary chair.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.973
The legs are the best part.

05:49.891 --> 05:53.895
Now matter how low the ceiling,
you can sit in total comfort.

05:54.771 --> 05:55.897
Wow. Amazing!

05:56.064 --> 05:57.858
A brilliant idea, Kipp!

05:58.024 --> 06:00.861
A wonderful example
of Elfkin craftsmanship.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.863
Wait until you see this.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.828
Presenting the one and only
Elfienesque turnip harvester.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.999
No more harvesting stupid turnips by hand.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.960
It'll never work, that's obvious.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.928
It's knocked your hats off, right?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.975
Quick, out of the way!
- Hats above!

06:35.854 --> 06:37.856
This wasn't part of the plan.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.941
Go away!

06:51.912 --> 06:53.914
It could have been worse.

06:54.998 --> 06:55.957
We're fine.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.043
Help. Help!
- It's Vendla.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.087
Are you okay, Vendla?

07:02.047 --> 07:03.798
Nothing is okay.

07:03.965 --> 07:07.928
We may be safe from humans down here,
but she's a danger to us all.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.889
I'm really sorry.

07:11.056 --> 07:15.018
I just thought we could...
-...make things "Elfier" down here!

07:15.852 --> 07:17.854
It's less Elfie we need!

07:19.940 --> 07:20.899
I just wanted to...

07:21.066 --> 07:24.903
You'll never be a true Elfkin.

07:25.904 --> 07:26.947
But...

08:46.026 --> 08:47.986
Where are you going?

08:48.194 --> 08:50.113
I'm going up to the humans.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.032
Are you crazy?

08:52.198 --> 08:55.910
Vendla says
humans eat Elfkins for breakfast.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.120
They even eat the hats.

08:57.996 --> 08:58.997
It's not normal.

08:59.164 --> 09:02.959
I don't think they're really that bad, Buck.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.920
Take a look.
They're the best of friends.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.089
I'm going to find a human
to teach me a craft.

09:08.256 --> 09:12.969
When I come back, I won't be
a useless Elfkin with a tiny hat.

09:13.136 --> 09:16.056
But what will I do without you?

09:16.222 --> 09:18.058
I'll be back really soon.

09:18.224 --> 09:22.020
Elfkins are swift, smart and swoosh, right?

09:22.187 --> 09:24.022
Exactly! Swoosh!

09:24.189 --> 09:25.940
What does that mean?

09:26.107 --> 09:28.068
We do our work in a heartbeat,

09:28.234 --> 09:30.153
and before they know it, we're gone.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.114
There's nothing we can't do!

09:35.033 --> 09:36.201
Well, almost nothing.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.089
It's my masterpiece.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.188
I think I should come along.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.233
But you already have a craft.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.152
It's boring making candles all day.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.071
I want to see the sun.

10:13.238 --> 10:17.158
It's brighter than all candles put together.
- Oh, Buck!

10:33.174 --> 10:37.053
I didn't think the human world
would be this beautiful.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.139
How big do you think it is?

10:40.098 --> 10:44.102
If you ask me,
about 100 times bigger than ours.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.105
Don't exaggerate!

10:47.272 --> 10:50.150
When the sun shines, it's even bigger.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.193
It makes everything on Earth grow.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.155
Is that why humans are so big?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.243
Hey, that's against the rules.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.162
It's you!
- Come with me.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.122
Let me go.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.173
We have to go back
before the humans see us.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.050
So go. I have something to take care of.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.136
She's learning a craft from the humans.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.056
I'll be back soon.
Tell the others I say hello.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.142
Are you out of your mind?

11:24.309 --> 11:28.271
Humans are sneaky and lazy.
You can't learn anything from them.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.315
Hey!

11:31.191 --> 11:32.192
Can anyone hear me?

11:32.358 --> 11:35.195
I'm out here, but it's not my fault.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.282
The sun!

11:42.118 --> 11:43.203
Have I grown yet?

11:44.329 --> 11:47.123
Look. A real bird.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.083
Flying must be amazing.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.336
There's a huge one letting off a giant fart.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.303
Elfie, look at this.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.222
What is it?

12:02.388 --> 12:05.266
It's where humans keep their food.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.353
They really do live in paradise.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.273
Hello! Can anyone hear me?

12:15.318 --> 12:17.362
It can't get any worse than this.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.366
A pig-dog!

12:24.327 --> 12:26.204
Kipp? Wrong way!

12:26.371 --> 12:27.372
What's that?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.250
Looks delicious.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.219
What do we do now?

12:52.230 --> 12:54.357
Which way?
- Away from the pig-dog.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.360
Bye!

12:59.320 --> 13:00.321
Bad dog!

13:03.199 --> 13:04.409
What can he possibly want from us?

13:08.371 --> 13:10.248
What now? Do something!

13:10.415 --> 13:12.333
He won't hurt us.
He just wants to play.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.378
Are you sure?
- Hold on.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.381
That Way!

13:19.257 --> 13:20.300
Fetch!

13:23.428 --> 13:26.389
This is what she calls
an Elfienesque idea?

13:32.395 --> 13:35.315
Happy birthday to me

13:36.232 --> 13:38.443
Happy birthday to me

13:39.402 --> 13:42.447
Happy birthday, dear Theo,

13:43.239 --> 13:44.240
Happy birthday...

13:44.407 --> 13:47.327
<i>To make your day bright and nice,
come to Bruno's cake paradise.</i>

13:47.493 --> 13:50.288
As if! Try "cake hell."

13:54.334 --> 13:55.460
Hello!

13:58.296 --> 14:00.381
Didn't this used to be Hampus Bakery?

14:00.548 --> 14:02.383
I remember it differently.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.344
Me too.

14:04.510 --> 14:08.348
It's been closed for a while now.
- Oh, no!

14:08.514 --> 14:11.309
Those legendary cream spires!

14:11.517 --> 14:14.228
I loved them.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.356
I practically lived off them.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.275
Stay there.

14:20.318 --> 14:24.322
To make your day bright and nice,
come to Bruno's cake...

14:24.530 --> 14:25.531
Lovely!

14:26.407 --> 14:29.327
Just pop it in with Bruno's cakes.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.415
How dare you?
- Go back to Bruno's.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.502
No wonder you're bankrupt!
- You old bag.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.304
The coast is clear.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.306
Let go, you baby giant.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.564
Too bad. That was yummy.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.486
Not again.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.492
Catch me if you can!

15:14.497 --> 15:16.332
Head for the bush.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.383
Scram, mutt. This isn't your yard.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.468
That was close!

15:27.635 --> 15:29.470
Over there. Follow me.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.348
Great! Breaking and entering.

15:32.515 --> 15:33.516
This isn't good!

15:36.477 --> 15:37.395
Stupid mutt.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.397
We'll be safe in here.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.442
What if he does the same to us?

15:42.608 --> 15:46.487
He won't. Elfie knows
a thing or two about humans. Right?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.451
This looks like a kind of a workshop.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.380
It's a bakery.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.590
A bakery?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.426
As in... cakes?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.597
Look at that.
Humans have a Hat Competition too.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.474
But it's broken.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.602
Typical.
Humans always destroy everything.

16:24.442 --> 16:25.568
Look at that!

16:26.569 --> 16:27.653
Yummy.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.573
Cream hats.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.493
Brilliant!

16:35.411 --> 16:36.537
Scram!

16:44.504 --> 16:45.505
Oh, no, you don't.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.423
Stupid mutt!

16:56.557 --> 16:57.600
Tasty.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.447
Now I know what I want to be.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.574
A pastry chef!

17:14.534 --> 17:16.702
Then I'll win a big hat like that too.

17:17.620 --> 17:18.704
YOU?

17:19.622 --> 17:21.499
That'll be the day.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.544
Well, maybe you can explain
why a pea-brain like you

17:24.710 --> 17:26.671
needs such a huge hat.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.549
Very funny.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.555
What the heck is going on here?

17:36.597 --> 17:37.682
Just what I need.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.600
Rats.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.565
Just you wait.
I'll show you who's boss.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.486
What did you say?
"We'll be safe in here?"

17:50.695 --> 17:52.655
Stop trembling!
- I'm not.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.619
It's just my body shaking.

18:00.663 --> 18:01.747
Get down!

18:04.584 --> 18:05.585
GOt you!

18:05.751 --> 18:08.546
I can't breathe.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.716
What are you?

18:12.592 --> 18:13.718
What do I look like?

18:16.554 --> 18:18.598
A garden gnome?

18:19.515 --> 18:21.601
No. You get one more shot.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.479
Maybe a... uh...

18:25.646 --> 18:27.607
Do I look like an "uh" to you?

18:27.773 --> 18:30.651
Fine. I'll help you out, just this once.

18:31.611 --> 18:35.573
I'm an Elf...
- What? No, that's impossible.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.576
An Elf...
- An elf fairy?

18:39.619 --> 18:42.622
"Fairy"? I'm an Elfkin!

18:43.581 --> 18:46.751
But... Elfkins and fairies don't exist.
You can't be real.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.754
Let her go, or you'll see how real we are.

18:50.546 --> 18:53.674
We have a match,
and we're not afraid to use it.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.762
You'd better not.

18:58.679 --> 19:01.599
I'm fond of my bakery,
not to mention my...

19:01.807 --> 19:03.517
Who did this?

19:03.684 --> 19:04.560
Not me!

19:04.727 --> 19:07.563
I've never eaten anything that tasty.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.523
How did you make it?

19:09.690 --> 19:10.650
Oh, that?

19:11.776 --> 19:13.527
None of your business.

19:13.694 --> 19:17.531
Come on! Don't be like that, Mr. Potato Nose.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.618
What's your name, anyway?
I'm Elfie.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.748
This is Buck,
and the pea-brain over there is Kipp.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.668
I'm Theo.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.628
Theo Hampus.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.797
Now that we're acquainted,

19:33.631 --> 19:36.676
I have a question,
from Elfkin to human

19:38.844 --> 19:41.847
Don't touch a thing.
And don't make a peep.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.646
Did you do that to Charles?

19:51.774 --> 19:52.775
Hello!

19:53.693 --> 19:55.736
You and your cream tart have three seconds

19:55.903 --> 19:57.697
before I throw you out.

19:57.863 --> 20:01.701
Wrong. I'm throwing you out.
You've been broke for ages.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.663
Because people only buy
your cheap gobstoppers.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.666
Better than your dusty old creations.
- Not again.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.876
You have no idea.
- No, you have no idea.

20:11.669 --> 20:12.753
No, you.
- No...

20:16.757 --> 20:17.717
Try this.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.760
Take that, wannabe genius.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.847
You pathetic show-off.
- Miserable sourpuss!

20:23.639 --> 20:24.849
Pompous jelly-belly!

20:25.683 --> 20:26.851
Hey! Not the cupcakes.

20:27.643 --> 20:28.728
Buck!

20:32.857 --> 20:36.652
You're the expert on humans.
He fights with everyone...

20:36.819 --> 20:40.781
But the sourpuss can bake better
than the jelly-belly.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.785
Get off me.
- Do you give up?

20:44.952 --> 20:46.704
No! Never!

20:47.663 --> 20:49.623
On the topic of giving up,

20:49.790 --> 20:52.626
can I remind you why we're here?

20:52.793 --> 20:53.711
What'?

20:53.878 --> 20:55.713
Oh, right.

20:57.715 --> 20:58.799
What's this?

20:58.966 --> 21:01.719
A detailed list of your unpaid bills.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.804
Electricity, gas, water...

21:03.971 --> 21:06.766
Let's cut to the chase.
I settled your debts.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.769
You have one week to pay me back.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.689
If you don't, the place is mine
and you can pack your bags.

21:13.856 --> 21:14.732
What?

21:14.899 --> 21:17.902
Oh yes, and happy birthday, brother dearest.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.821
It's worse than I thought.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.701
You really should have told us.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.704
Happy birthday
and a hat full of joy

21:28.871 --> 21:31.707
Happy birthday,
may you get a new toy...

21:34.794 --> 21:36.712
My home.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.714
No reason to lose your hat.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.674
If you just bake a bunch of cakes,

21:40.841 --> 21:44.720
you'll have more money
than you know what to do with.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.850
I guess I can go pack my bags.

21:50.935 --> 21:53.771
There goes your pastry chef dream.

21:53.938 --> 21:56.732
So we can finally go back home.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.738
No, wait!

22:02.905 --> 22:05.741
I can help you. We can all help you.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.869
We're Elfkins, after all.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.876
We work night and day,
and in between too.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.847
Don't worry, we'll use our Elfkin magic.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.769
You've just got to teach me to bake.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.730
You don't know how to bake?

22:36.897 --> 22:38.941
No, but it can't be that difficult.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.902
Let's get this lesson underway.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.908
I'll turn the oven on.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.911
Elfie knows what she's doing.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.747
Or maybe not!

22:53.914 --> 22:55.916
I'll put that out in the drop of a hat.

22:58.002 --> 22:59.837
"Gasoline"?

23:00.004 --> 23:01.005
Never heard of it.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.800
Stop!

23:08.846 --> 23:10.723
Yet another problem solved.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.017
And so swooshily, or whatever that word is.

23:18.939 --> 23:22.943
Believe it or not,
we Elfkins are really handy to have around.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.945
If we're treated well.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.824
This is terrible treatment.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.997
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you.

23:37.041 --> 23:40.920
How? You just torched his baking supplies.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.799
<i>Don't miss our sale on plums today.</i>

23:45.966 --> 23:49.053
If I get him new ingredients,
he won't be angry anymore.

23:49.929 --> 23:50.971
It's teeming with humans!

23:51.138 --> 23:53.057
Your idea is totally ridiculous.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.017
No, it's Elfienesque.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.061
Same difference.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.939
We'll do it Elfkin style:
swift, smart and swoosh.

24:00.105 --> 24:03.859
Right. Swoosh!
- Forget it. I'm staying here.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.905
Go do your business, Charles.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.033
The pig-dog!

24:12.910 --> 24:14.912
Stop. Wait for me!

24:27.049 --> 24:28.884
Go.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.097
Oopsy daisy!

24:45.025 --> 24:46.068
Jelly beans!

24:47.027 --> 24:48.028
I'm flying!

24:50.948 --> 24:51.949
Oh boy.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.091
Yes!

25:13.053 --> 25:16.015
I'll help you.
Poor little doggie.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.027
Down, you rotten mutt.
- Not my hat!

25:37.119 --> 25:40.080
Harriet, sugarplum,
it's your favorite boss.

25:40.247 --> 25:42.124
Hi, boss,
- Where are you'?

25:45.169 --> 25:47.046
What happened to my store?

25:47.212 --> 25:49.048
<i>It wasn't me. It was Charles.</i>

25:49.214 --> 25:52.051
He went totally nuts. He probably saw a rat.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.178
<i>Was it wearing a hat?</i>

25:56.013 --> 25:58.932
<i>Come back this instant.
Don't you dare dawdle.</i>

25:59.099 --> 26:01.977
What happened?
- Clean this up, quick.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.980
But I'm off now. My shift is over.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.107
We can hit the road too.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.193
How will we transport all this?

26:11.111 --> 26:13.030
Piece of cake. The Elfie way.

26:13.197 --> 26:16.200
I feel naked without a hat.
I'm not going anywhere.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.248
Here we go.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.010
That's enough!

26:35.177 --> 26:36.220
Watch out, Frieda.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.181
This is so much fun!

26:45.020 --> 26:46.146
Out of the way!

26:54.154 --> 26:56.156
We're back!

26:57.157 --> 27:00.035
We got you new ingredients.
- Ta-da!

27:00.202 --> 27:02.996
Plus other great things, like fart beans.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.164
Where did you get all this?

27:04.331 --> 27:08.961
From a giant pantry.
You've never seen anything like it.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.172
Are we friends again?
Now it's time to save your bakery!

27:13.132 --> 27:14.216
Stop. Don't.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.095
It's your choice: bake it or leg it.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.142
Fine.

27:26.270 --> 27:30.274
Baking apprentice Elfie reporting for duty,
Master Baker.

27:31.275 --> 27:35.195
Fine. First we'll need strawberries
from the garden.

27:39.116 --> 27:41.160
Hey.
- He tricked us.

27:42.286 --> 27:45.247
Hey! Don't you dare start without us.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.291
That's humans for you.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.085
Sneaky and ungrateful.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.135
I want to bake like you.

28:05.267 --> 28:09.229
Let get something straight.
Elfkins have always helped humans.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.190
Now it's your turn to help us.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.108
No one has ever helped me.

28:13.275 --> 28:16.153
I'm not surprised. A sourpuss like you...

28:17.362 --> 28:19.198
Can't catch me!

28:20.240 --> 28:21.325
Wrong one.

28:22.326 --> 28:24.036
Over here.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.245
Wrong again.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.291
<i>Loser'.</i>

28:32.252 --> 28:33.337
Jackpou

28:42.304 --> 28:45.349
I'm not going anywhere
until you've taught me to bake.

28:49.228 --> 28:52.231
That's blackmail, you little pest.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.150
I think that means yes.

28:55.317 --> 28:58.111
Afterwards, I want you gone.
- I promise.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.239
Cross my Elfkin heart.

29:01.365 --> 29:02.366
We will.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.077
Fine, you can give me a hand.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.080
Get me flour, sugar, butter, vanilla extract.
- Okay.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.331
What are you waiting for?

29:16.213 --> 29:19.258
It's not my fault.
I need Elfkin-sized tools.

29:25.222 --> 29:28.267
Vendla was right.
Humans are bossy and arrogant.

29:28.433 --> 29:33.188
Destroying your master's store
is very, very naughty!

29:33.355 --> 29:37.192
Take that thing out of your mouth
when I'm scolding you.

29:42.239 --> 29:43.323
Not again!

29:47.286 --> 29:49.204
The ovens are overheating.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.290
We need to fix the control system.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.250
There's no rush.

29:53.417 --> 29:56.128
We'll all be blown into the air!

29:56.295 --> 29:58.297
We really need that new factory.

29:59.256 --> 30:02.217
In one week, we'll start with construction.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.387
She's a real beauty.

30:06.305 --> 30:09.433
What if your brother
can pay off his debts after all?

30:16.398 --> 30:21.278
As my father used to say,
"You have to love what you bake."

30:27.242 --> 30:31.163
For that, you need a gentle touch.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.414
A gentle touch, got it.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.427
You need patience too.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.349
Only a bit, though.

30:59.441 --> 31:02.361
And precision.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.323
Pre... what?

31:07.366 --> 31:10.285
Can I do some baking now too?
- No.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.497
But we had a deal.

31:14.289 --> 31:15.248
Hold your horses.

31:15.415 --> 31:18.335
I said you can give me a hand, that's all.

31:19.503 --> 31:23.423
<i>"I'll</i> be a pastry chef
and win the biggest hat ever."

31:23.590 --> 31:25.384
Just you wait!

31:30.472 --> 31:33.350
Hey, I can't work like this.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.438
Baking is so fun!

31:39.523 --> 31:43.360
It's floury in here.
- Not another word. Got it?

31:44.319 --> 31:47.406
Got it?
- You said we couldn't talk.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.283
We've got it.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.537
I thought you wanted to learn how to bake.
- You won't let me.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.331
Learn to use your hands first.

31:56.540 --> 31:59.501
Maybe then I'll show you
how to bake from the heart.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.379
Now get to work.
- Okay.

32:18.353 --> 32:19.563
Enough. It's my bedtime.

32:22.399 --> 32:23.608
You clean the kitchen.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.589
Finished. It's spick and span.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.425
Can we sleep here?
- No.

32:48.592 --> 32:50.385
No way.

32:53.388 --> 32:54.514
Just this once.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.519
I think sourpuss is a lot nicer
than he seems.

32:59.686 --> 33:03.482
Humans often seem nice.
Then all of sudden they turn mean.

33:03.648 --> 33:07.402
What do you know about humans,
Mr. Pea-brain?

33:07.569 --> 33:09.613
Call me a pea-brain one more time...

33:10.405 --> 33:12.324
If that's what you want.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.534
Pea-brain.
- Tiny hat-wearer.

33:19.456 --> 33:21.500
No, don't. We'll be quiet.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.461
I told you. Humans are mean.

33:24.628 --> 33:27.547
What's going on? Are we on a boat?

33:33.428 --> 33:34.554
Just great.

33:35.597 --> 33:37.641
Let's see if we can find a lantern.

33:38.475 --> 33:40.602
What for? There's one in the sky.

33:44.648 --> 33:47.609
If only the others could see this.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.451
Look!
- Amazing!

33:56.618 --> 33:58.620
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.547
Incredible!

34:24.521 --> 34:25.605
Hello.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.483
Sorry.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.537
We didn't touch much.
- It's so pretty.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.707
The Moon Song.

34:44.624 --> 34:47.586
Bruno and I used to listen to it every night.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.506
Why don't you get along anymore?

34:52.549 --> 34:54.509
It's a sad story.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.511
Tell us!
- No.

34:56.678 --> 34:59.598
I want to sleep.
- But we know where you sleep...

35:02.601 --> 35:04.686
Okay, okay! Fine.

35:07.689 --> 35:10.609
We used to be the perfect team.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.737
I'd sneak into Dad's kitchen
at night to bake.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.700
Bruno would sell everything
to the kids living nearby.

35:19.576 --> 35:21.661
They were crazy for my cupcakes,

35:21.828 --> 35:24.748
and Bruno was a brilliant salesman.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.627
We spent our earnings on toys.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.630
Boy, it was a true paradise.

35:32.756 --> 35:36.509
At night, I'd write
new recipes in my notebook,

35:36.676 --> 35:40.680
and Bruno would stuff our earnings
into our little treasure chest.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.479
Anyway, that was long ago.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.523
Hey, but what about the sad part?

35:50.690 --> 35:52.734
Finish the story.
- Please!

35:53.610 --> 35:54.653
You little pests.

35:56.780 --> 36:01.576
It began with
the International Confectionary Championship.

36:01.743 --> 36:05.664
I was the youngest person ever to win.
Dad was so proud of me.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.792
And Bruno was jealous?
- Yes.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.795
That was the end of our dream team.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.590
When Dad died,
Bruno wanted to close the store

36:15.757 --> 36:17.509
and build a factory.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.760
Conveyor belt cakes!

36:20.595 --> 36:21.638
Baking is an art form.

36:21.805 --> 36:25.642
Theo Hampus will never
work behind an assembly line.

36:25.809 --> 36:29.646
Things spiraled out of control.
Bruno upped and left.

36:29.813 --> 36:33.775
Soon after, he built
that ugly building right opposite.

36:34.734 --> 36:38.738
He's left me a poor baker,
while he's a wealthy sleazebag.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.741
That's the whole story.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.744
Now go to sleep.
We're getting up early.

36:58.717 --> 36:59.759
Yes!

37:03.805 --> 37:05.724
Buck! Kipp!

37:05.890 --> 37:07.851
It's time to start baking.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.688
How do you propose
we use all those heavy machines?

37:11.855 --> 37:14.733
That's where you come into it, pea-brain.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.739
What do you say?
It's incredible, right?

37:34.836 --> 37:36.921
We built you this crazy machine

37:37.839 --> 37:40.675
And now it's time for you to see

37:40.842 --> 37:43.678
With Elfkin-skill and Elfie-power

37:43.845 --> 37:46.723
We'll become the masters of the flour

37:46.890 --> 37:49.768
Mixing bowls clatter,
we're in the zone

37:49.934 --> 37:52.729
Elfie-chaos takes control

37:52.896 --> 37:55.899
We know the tricks that really stick

37:56.733 --> 37:58.735
And you can't help but think it's fantastic

37:58.902 --> 38:01.821
Now don't become flustered
This is super-Elfienesque!

38:01.988 --> 38:04.949
'Cause me Kipp and Buck
are simply the best

38:05.700 --> 38:06.743
That's Elfkin style

38:06.910 --> 38:07.827
Yeah, yeah, yeah

38:07.994 --> 38:09.829
Yeah, that's Elfkin style

38:11.790 --> 38:13.917
That's Elfkin style
yeah, yeah, yeah

38:14.709 --> 38:15.835
Yeah, that's Elfkin style

38:18.922 --> 38:20.799
That's Elfkin style

38:23.885 --> 38:26.805
We're sweeping through the bakery,
the wind of change is blowing

38:26.971 --> 38:29.808
Put the pedal to the metal
'cause when the Elfkin show is showing

38:29.974 --> 38:32.936
We do everything we can
'cause that is what we do

38:33.728 --> 38:35.772
Once the Elfkin ball is rolling
we cannot be stopped!

38:35.939 --> 38:38.858
Yo, we be bakin' up a storm,
we ain't beatin' around the bush

38:39.025 --> 38:42.654
Elfie, Kipp and Buck are baking
swift and smart and swoosh

38:42.821 --> 38:43.863
That's Elfkin style

38:45.824 --> 38:48.660
We do it right
You can count on us completely

38:48.827 --> 38:51.746
This is Elfkin style
Yeah, yeah, yeah

38:51.913 --> 38:52.997
Yeah, that's Elfkin style

38:54.874 --> 38:57.794
That's Elfkin style
Yeah, yeah, yeah

38:57.961 --> 38:59.754
We do it right

39:00.964 --> 39:03.800
This is Elfkin style
Yeah, yeah, yeah

39:04.759 --> 39:06.886
Ready, set and go!

39:07.804 --> 39:09.013
Kipp invented it all.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.808
He's got more in his pea brain
that you'd think.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.810
Piece of cake.

39:18.857 --> 39:19.899
You're all nutty,

39:21.901 --> 39:23.736
and I like it.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.822
Now it's time to save your bakery.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.826
Try this.
- Too much sugar.

39:29.993 --> 39:32.996
Is it better now?
- Stir it for longer.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.790
More cinnamon.

39:36.958 --> 39:40.920
What are you doing there?
- I'm not ready yet. Don't look.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.799
Your cakes are really tasty,

39:44.966 --> 39:47.844
but we need to make this place
so much "Elfier!"

39:57.812 --> 39:58.980
Good thing Elfkins are here to help.

40:01.983 --> 40:03.902
What does this thing do?

40:09.908 --> 40:10.909
Again!

40:41.898 --> 40:43.066
I'm ready now.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.077
You told us
you have to love what you bake.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.877
Well? What do you think?

41:04.921 --> 41:06.047
You're doing it on purpose.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.886
I didn't think you had it in you.

41:15.890 --> 41:18.935
It's just like it used to be.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.104
But even better.

41:24.107 --> 41:27.944
We just cleaned the floor.
- Leave him alone.

41:28.111 --> 41:30.947
I told you we'd do it Elfkin style.

41:31.948 --> 41:32.907
You really did.

41:33.074 --> 41:36.911
You're small, but when it comes to helping,
you're the greatest.

41:37.078 --> 41:38.079
Wait a minute.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.961
What a cool lightning machine.

41:53.177 --> 41:55.138
It's time to open the bakery.

41:56.014 --> 41:56.973
Come in, everyone.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.933
So soon?

42:00.059 --> 42:01.144
Hey, you have to smile.

42:04.105 --> 42:05.189
Like this.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.066
No, even more!

42:07.233 --> 42:09.027
Come and help.
Like this.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.029
Now stay like that.

42:16.117 --> 42:18.036
Why isn't anyone coming?

42:18.202 --> 42:21.164
Well, the store has been closed for years.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.960
They'll come soon enough.
- Definitely!

42:32.175 --> 42:34.969
No one remembers me.

42:39.015 --> 42:40.141
We can change that.

42:45.188 --> 42:47.106
Load up.

42:54.155 --> 42:55.990
All aboard.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.201
Fart rocket ready for takeoff.

42:59.160 --> 43:02.080
This plan is much too Elfienesque for me.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.123
Trust me, you get used to it.

43:09.170 --> 43:10.254
I've forgotten something...

43:22.183 --> 43:24.102
UP We go!

43:30.233 --> 43:32.151
You're doing great, Kipp!

43:52.046 --> 43:55.133
Look at that.
- What's that?

43:55.299 --> 43:58.177
Huge snowflakes!
- No, flying muffins.

44:00.263 --> 44:03.057
There's writing on it! What does it say?

44:03.224 --> 44:04.976
"Hampus Bakery."

44:05.143 --> 44:08.020
It's mine!
-"Tomorrow at ten, grand re-opening."

44:08.187 --> 44:10.064
Give it to me!

44:15.111 --> 44:17.071
Come to Rosa!

44:17.238 --> 44:20.074
I'll eat my hat if this doesn't work.

44:25.121 --> 44:26.164
What is that?

44:27.248 --> 44:29.250
Stop the car!

44:35.256 --> 44:37.175
Finally!

44:37.341 --> 44:40.261
Elfie, now I know what I forgot.

44:41.179 --> 44:42.263
The brakes!

44:50.104 --> 44:51.105
Are you okay?

44:51.272 --> 44:54.108
It's the test phase.
- We'll go again tomorrow!

44:54.275 --> 44:55.276
Out of the question.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.236
Why not?

44:58.279 --> 44:59.363
Because...

45:00.114 --> 45:03.159
I was worried about you little nincompoops.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.329
Because you like us, Mr. Sourpuss?

45:07.121 --> 45:09.081
I wouldn't put it like that.

45:09.248 --> 45:11.209
Fine, fine. Darn it!

45:12.168 --> 45:14.212
As human's go, he's pretty okay.

45:16.214 --> 45:18.257
What... What was that?

45:21.219 --> 45:22.303
Yummy!

45:27.266 --> 45:30.311
How did that loser
turn things around so fast?

45:35.399 --> 45:37.360
Are you sure about this, boss?

45:39.237 --> 45:40.321
Quiet!

45:50.289 --> 45:54.335
This is our...
- This is so scrumptious.

46:02.343 --> 46:04.262
This used to be mine.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.266
I don't believe it.

46:09.183 --> 46:12.270
He made all this using our old toys.

46:24.323 --> 46:26.284
We'll be nice and quiet.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.202
She means we'll try.

46:32.415 --> 46:34.417
Careful.
- Get out!

46:35.293 --> 46:37.211
This is my bakery.

46:37.378 --> 46:40.214
And this is my bulldozer!
You can't use it.

46:40.381 --> 46:42.341
I can use anything I want in my house.

46:44.427 --> 46:46.304
It's my house too.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.306
All of a sudden?

46:48.472 --> 46:52.143
You always said the bakery
was too small and pokey.

46:52.310 --> 46:54.186
You wanted to put it up for sale.

46:54.353 --> 46:56.355
We were in debt up to our noses.

46:58.399 --> 47:02.278
Fancy baking isn't enough.
Selling is an art form too.

47:02.445 --> 47:05.281
But you and Dad never understood that.

47:06.282 --> 47:08.159
You had your moment of glory.

47:08.326 --> 47:10.328
The youngest champion ever!

47:10.494 --> 47:12.246
Dad's pride and joy.

47:13.456 --> 47:16.208
You had to go and ruin everything.

47:16.375 --> 47:20.379
Now you and this ramshackle place
will make space for my factory.

47:24.383 --> 47:25.468
We have to help Theo.

47:28.429 --> 47:31.265
I'm not ready to meet my maker.

47:31.474 --> 47:33.517
Remember the legend?

47:38.481 --> 47:39.523
The tailor's wife's trick?

47:44.362 --> 47:45.446
Now!

47:51.285 --> 47:53.287
No! That wasn't supposed to happen.

47:53.454 --> 47:55.414
Theo! Theo, wake up.

47:56.290 --> 47:57.416
Theo!
- Quick, hide.

48:03.381 --> 48:04.465
He's alive.

48:05.466 --> 48:07.385
But it doesn't look good.

48:08.427 --> 48:10.304
Call an ambulance.

48:12.306 --> 48:13.474
His old recipe book.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.356
He needs to rest now.

48:20.523 --> 48:23.526
He has a severe concussion.
They're giving him a sedative.

48:24.360 --> 48:26.487
He'll have to stay here for a few days.

48:27.363 --> 48:29.365
It looks like his shop has had it.

48:29.532 --> 48:31.534
I didn't want it to happen like this.

48:42.461 --> 48:44.505
Theo, could you please wake up?

48:45.423 --> 48:46.424
It's important.

48:48.426 --> 48:50.344
Look, he's waking up.

48:50.511 --> 48:52.596
Oh my, three garden gnomes.

48:53.472 --> 48:54.473
You're walking on thin ice!

48:54.640 --> 48:57.393
No, it's me, Elfie!

48:58.436 --> 49:00.521
Talking garden gnomes.

49:03.399 --> 49:05.484
No, don't go to sleep, Theo!

49:05.651 --> 49:07.528
Hey! Wake up!

49:08.404 --> 49:09.447
Wake up!

49:10.364 --> 49:11.449
Come on.

49:11.615 --> 49:13.492
Wake up.
- Forget it.

49:14.410 --> 49:16.454
When someone his size conks out...

49:16.620 --> 49:20.499
When he wakes up, his bakery will be gone.

49:28.591 --> 49:30.384
What are you doing?

49:30.551 --> 49:31.469
Saving the bakery.

49:31.635 --> 49:34.597
Just the three of us?
She's delusional.

49:36.432 --> 49:37.433
I'll get us help.

49:37.600 --> 49:40.436
The bakery opens at 10 o'clock.
We have time.

49:40.603 --> 49:43.481
No human would ever help an Elfkin.

49:43.647 --> 49:45.357
I'm not asking the humans.

49:45.524 --> 49:46.484
I'm enlisting the others.

49:46.650 --> 49:49.653
Theo said it himself.
We're the greatest at helping.

49:51.447 --> 49:52.573
If Bruno shows up...

49:56.660 --> 49:58.579
We'll take care of him.

50:05.503 --> 50:07.379
You'd better come back.

50:07.546 --> 50:08.589
Be careful.

50:17.556 --> 50:18.599
Hey!

50:30.444 --> 50:32.655
Hey! Where is everyone?

50:33.531 --> 50:34.532
Hello?

50:50.714 --> 50:54.593
Let us always remember
Kipp, Buck and Elfie.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.512
Wherever their souls are,

50:56.679 --> 50:59.431
may they always have
a warm hat on their heads.

50:59.598 --> 51:00.599
We do!

51:02.518 --> 51:03.686
Don't worry about that.

51:04.562 --> 51:06.605
Elfie! We thought you were...

51:07.523 --> 51:08.482
Where have you been?

51:08.649 --> 51:10.484
Elfie!
- Up there, with the humans.

51:10.651 --> 51:13.487
She's totally lost it.
- Where are Buck and Kipp?

51:13.654 --> 51:15.531
Looking after Theo's bakery.

51:15.698 --> 51:16.532
Who's that?

51:16.699 --> 51:18.534
Theo's a human being.

51:19.577 --> 51:23.539
One of the good ones.
He taught me to bake.

51:23.706 --> 51:26.625
You can eat them. Try!
- Really?

51:29.587 --> 51:30.588
Take it.

51:35.593 --> 51:38.596
I made them myself. I'm a baker now.

51:39.638 --> 51:40.598
That may be the case,

51:40.764 --> 51:42.641
but you'll get the others right now,

51:42.808 --> 51:45.769
and then we'll never
speak about this again.

51:46.520 --> 51:47.646
I don't think so!

51:47.813 --> 51:51.442
You have to come with me.
I have a plan...

51:51.609 --> 51:55.529
Little one, your plans
are usually pretty dangerous.

51:55.779 --> 51:58.449
But Theo needs our help.

51:58.616 --> 52:01.619
If he can't manage alone, that's his problem.

52:01.785 --> 52:05.539
But helping is what we do best, isn't it?

52:05.706 --> 52:07.625
Says who?

52:07.791 --> 52:09.627
Theo and me.

52:10.586 --> 52:13.505
Dratted hat, don't you get it?

52:13.672 --> 52:15.591
Helping is our real purpose in life.

52:15.758 --> 52:18.761
Not how well we build chairs or dye shoes.

52:19.553 --> 52:20.471
Hush!

52:20.638 --> 52:23.641
Not even how well we bake.
We forgot our real purpose.

52:23.807 --> 52:27.561
We Elfkins are the only ones
who can help Theo.

52:27.728 --> 52:28.729
So what do you say?

52:35.569 --> 52:37.571
Nothing's going to change.

52:37.738 --> 52:40.616
They stay up there, we stay down here.

53:03.806 --> 53:06.642
I really wanted to help you.

53:06.809 --> 53:09.520
It sounded so easy in the legend.

53:09.687 --> 53:12.648
You humans sleep,
while we do it Elfkin style.

53:15.693 --> 53:19.613
I guess I'll never be a real Elfkin.

53:22.658 --> 53:23.701
Hold on.

53:23.867 --> 53:25.828
The jury is still out on that.

53:27.705 --> 53:30.666
They showed up in the bakery
all of a sudden.

53:30.833 --> 53:33.877
It was easy to find.
We followed the smell of your cakes.

53:34.878 --> 53:37.715
We don't want people saying we Elfkins

53:37.881 --> 53:40.634
don't help one another.

53:40.801 --> 53:41.719
My goodness,

53:41.885 --> 53:45.764
humans are even bigger and uglier
than I thought.

53:46.724 --> 53:48.559
Fine. We'll help you.

53:48.726 --> 53:49.893
But there's one condition.

53:50.728 --> 53:54.732
When we've finished,
we're leaving and never coming back.

53:55.649 --> 53:57.693
That goes for you too, Elfie.

54:01.822 --> 54:03.866
So what's your plan?

54:04.783 --> 54:06.785
We need Theo to make it work.

54:09.788 --> 54:12.666
Push!
- Left!

54:15.878 --> 54:17.713
More left.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.673
Right!

54:36.815 --> 54:37.900
Now what?

54:38.859 --> 54:41.612
Now we bake till our hats are smoking.

54:41.779 --> 54:43.655
Theo will sell what we make.

54:43.822 --> 54:45.657
Come on. He's just a human.

54:45.824 --> 54:47.826
A harmless human.
- I'm not sure...

54:48.827 --> 54:50.704
See? He wouldn't hurt a fly.

54:55.751 --> 54:59.797
How will this snoozing monster
ever sell anything?

54:59.963 --> 55:01.924
You must be crazy.

55:02.966 --> 55:04.760
If you say so.

55:04.927 --> 55:06.929
But just you wait until the show starts!

55:07.888 --> 55:10.724
One, two, one, two, one, two...

55:15.896 --> 55:17.731
Out of the way.

55:18.941 --> 55:20.818
Good job!

55:21.902 --> 55:23.779
You have to stir longer.

55:32.913 --> 55:34.790
What do you think?

55:45.759 --> 55:48.887
Harriet, order the bulldozer.
It's showtime.

55:53.851 --> 55:56.895
Quick, everyone take your positions.

55:58.897 --> 55:59.940
Hello?

56:00.816 --> 56:01.859
Is anyone here?

56:10.993 --> 56:12.911
Beautiful.

56:19.793 --> 56:20.961
Focus!

56:23.797 --> 56:26.925
Welcome to my little shop of wonders.

56:27.092 --> 56:28.886
What can I get you?

56:29.928 --> 56:31.013
Lemon fish?

56:31.972 --> 56:33.807
Elfkin hats?

56:33.974 --> 56:35.934
Or would you prefer the moon?

56:40.939 --> 56:43.859
Wonderful. I'll take them all.
- Really?

56:44.026 --> 56:46.945
I mean, that's a brilliant decision.

56:48.947 --> 56:50.032
Thank you.

56:50.949 --> 56:54.995
Have a nice day, Madame.
Be sure to recommend us.

56:56.038 --> 56:57.873
It worked!

57:32.866 --> 57:35.077
Ladies and gentleman,
and now for our specialty:

57:35.911 --> 57:36.995
cream spires!

57:37.955 --> 57:39.873
Cream spires!

57:44.044 --> 57:46.964
What's wrong with him?
- Good heavens?

57:49.967 --> 57:51.093
A work of art.

57:53.971 --> 57:56.974
In my dream, you were tiny
and wearing funny hats.

57:57.140 --> 57:59.101
What now?
- Get them out. Quick.

58:00.894 --> 58:02.980
Ladies and gentleman, the show is done.

58:03.146 --> 58:04.106
Hope you had fun.

58:05.065 --> 58:08.902
It must be part of the performance.
- Is it over already?

58:09.111 --> 58:10.946
Don't go!

58:11.113 --> 58:13.073
No, it's time to go home!

58:14.116 --> 58:16.118
I'll bring my wife tomorrow.

58:18.996 --> 58:20.080
What's going on?

58:20.998 --> 58:22.833
My bakery?

58:23.000 --> 58:24.042
Is this my bakery?

58:24.209 --> 58:27.963
You bet.
We're going to make sure it stays that way.

58:28.130 --> 58:30.048
But... how did you...

58:31.049 --> 58:33.969
We had a little help.
May I introduce...

58:34.136 --> 58:35.929
My friends!
- You're the best!

58:36.096 --> 58:37.973
You all...

58:38.974 --> 58:41.059
You really are the greatest. Thanks.

58:41.226 --> 58:43.061
Thank you so much.
- No big deal.

58:44.062 --> 58:46.148
The glass baking line.

58:47.024 --> 58:48.066
It should have four lanes!

58:48.233 --> 58:50.902
Actually, let's make it eight.

58:51.069 --> 58:52.154
Eight baking lanes.

58:54.114 --> 58:55.157
We're even.

58:56.158 --> 58:59.119
I don't want to see you in my bakery again.

59:00.954 --> 59:02.164
But he was in hospital...

59:03.957 --> 59:05.042
What'?

59:07.085 --> 59:08.920
The hat!

59:09.087 --> 59:10.005
So it wasn't a rat.

59:10.172 --> 59:11.089
It was garden gnomes.

59:11.256 --> 59:13.008
Garden gnomes?

59:13.175 --> 59:15.886
Those are Elfkins.

59:16.053 --> 59:18.055
My brother has Elfkins!

59:18.221 --> 59:20.098
It's not fair.

59:21.099 --> 59:23.101
They raided my store.

59:23.268 --> 59:25.062
They're criminals.

59:26.980 --> 59:29.066
Now it's time to celebrate!

59:31.151 --> 59:33.153
Where is everyone?

59:36.198 --> 59:38.033
What's wrong?

59:39.076 --> 59:40.952
I have to go, Theo.

59:41.119 --> 59:42.079
Nonsense!

59:42.245 --> 59:44.915
Forget about our silly deal.

59:45.082 --> 59:46.124
It's expired.

59:46.291 --> 59:49.044
You don't have to go.
- But I do.

59:49.211 --> 59:51.129
That's how it works with Elfkins.

59:51.296 --> 59:54.174
When our work is done, we have to go.

59:55.092 --> 59:57.135
But there's still so much to bake.

59:57.302 --> 1:00:01.014
Strawberry and ginger cakes.
Marshmallow cookies...

1:00:01.181 --> 1:00:03.058
with melted chocolate!

1:00:04.017 --> 1:00:05.185
Please stay.

1:00:06.228 --> 1:00:10.107
We need to make this place so much "Elfier!"

1:00:11.066 --> 1:00:12.109
But I can't.

1:00:13.068 --> 1:00:14.152
I promised them I'd leave.

1:00:14.319 --> 1:00:15.946
But...

1:00:16.113 --> 1:00:17.072
But...

1:00:18.156 --> 1:00:21.118
You'd better not forget me, Mr. Sourpuss.

1:00:21.284 --> 1:00:23.036
I won't,

1:00:23.245 --> 1:00:25.163
you little pest.

1:00:26.039 --> 1:00:27.124
Oh, yes...

1:00:28.166 --> 1:00:30.210
I have a little something for you.

1:00:32.129 --> 1:00:33.171
For me?

1:00:33.338 --> 1:00:35.215
I've got my own hat!

1:00:36.049 --> 1:00:38.176
A really big one!

1:00:42.264 --> 1:00:44.099
Thank you.

1:00:47.227 --> 1:00:49.187
I'm going to miss you all.

1:00:53.275 --> 1:00:55.152
We'll miss you too.

1:00:56.153 --> 1:00:57.237
Bye.

1:01:04.202 --> 1:01:06.246
That's some hat.

1:01:08.123 --> 1:01:10.083
Congratulations, Elfie.

1:01:10.250 --> 1:01:13.086
It's time to go.
- Yes.

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:25.098
Enough of the long face.

1:01:25.265 --> 1:01:27.267
I'm looking forward to your cakes.

1:01:33.148 --> 1:01:34.191
What's that?

1:01:34.357 --> 1:01:35.317
An animal?

1:01:36.318 --> 1:01:38.153
It's a contraption!

1:01:41.198 --> 1:01:42.282
Well done, Charles.

1:01:44.201 --> 1:01:46.369
No! Not my hat!

1:01:47.329 --> 1:01:50.165
They do look like garden gnomes.

1:01:50.332 --> 1:01:52.167
They're so cute. Can I have one?

1:01:52.334 --> 1:01:54.127
No. I still need them.

1:01:54.294 --> 1:01:57.172
When Theo finds out,
he'll knock your hat off.

1:01:57.339 --> 1:01:59.132
He's my friend.

1:01:59.299 --> 1:02:01.134
Your accomplice, you mean.

1:02:01.301 --> 1:02:03.345
You looted my store together.

1:02:04.346 --> 1:02:06.264
I'm not one to hold a grudge.

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:11.311
I'm offering you a glorious future
in the world's most modern factory.

1:02:12.229 --> 1:02:14.147
You're going to love it.

1:02:14.314 --> 1:02:15.232
Dream on!

1:02:17.275 --> 1:02:18.276
He sure can.

1:02:19.194 --> 1:02:21.279
We're leaving. Let's go
- All together.

1:02:27.369 --> 1:02:29.287
Now lift it.

1:02:38.213 --> 1:02:39.214
Now what?

1:02:41.299 --> 1:02:42.259
There!

1:02:42.425 --> 1:02:44.344
We'll take the cable car.

1:02:56.439 --> 1:02:58.358
I can taste freedom!

1:03:00.235 --> 1:03:01.319
No, wrong direction.

1:03:13.415 --> 1:03:16.251
Nice try. You're staying here.

1:03:50.243 --> 1:03:51.328
Brother dearest!

1:03:52.412 --> 1:03:56.249
I've always wanted to drive one of these.
Remember?

1:03:56.416 --> 1:03:58.418
Hey! I paid off my debt.

1:03:59.294 --> 1:04:00.337
By stealing from me.

1:04:00.503 --> 1:04:01.379
That doesn't count.

1:04:01.546 --> 1:04:05.258
I know all about
your criminal little friends.

1:04:05.425 --> 1:04:07.385
Get them on screen, Harriet.

1:04:13.433 --> 1:04:15.268
Let them go!

1:04:15.435 --> 1:04:16.436
They didn't hurt you.

1:04:17.354 --> 1:04:20.273
They robbed me blind
and destroyed my store.

1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:22.525
They'll be working in my new factory.

1:04:23.485 --> 1:04:24.527
Out of my way.

1:04:26.488 --> 1:04:28.365
And we're live.

1:04:28.531 --> 1:04:32.285
<i>They'd much rather work for me
than in your dump.</i>

1:04:33.370 --> 1:04:35.455
<i>Let them go,
and I'll get out of your way.</i>

1:04:36.373 --> 1:04:38.333
<i>Don't do it, Theo.
- Move!</i>

1:04:38.500 --> 1:04:42.462
I bet my hat he wouldn't
give up his bakery for us.

1:04:43.380 --> 1:04:45.548
You stubborn mule. Don't do this.

1:04:46.341 --> 1:04:48.343
Let them go,
or you'll have to drive over me.

1:04:48.510 --> 1:04:52.222
You were always like this.
Totally inflexible.

1:04:52.389 --> 1:04:54.516
Harriet, bring me those munchkins.

1:04:55.392 --> 1:04:56.518
They're Elfkins!

1:04:57.477 --> 1:04:59.229
Not munchkins.

1:04:59.396 --> 1:05:01.398
Theo! No! Don't do it.

1:05:01.564 --> 1:05:03.358
It'll have all been in vain!

1:05:06.528 --> 1:05:07.570
No!

1:05:09.364 --> 1:05:10.532
Harriet, get back inside!

1:05:11.324 --> 1:05:12.492
Got it. They don't go free.

1:05:13.493 --> 1:05:14.494
You double-crosser.

1:05:24.379 --> 1:05:25.422
Elfie!

1:05:29.426 --> 1:05:31.261
We have to stop Bruno.

1:05:31.428 --> 1:05:32.595
Elfie, come back.

1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:41.312
Stop it, jelly-belly!

1:05:41.479 --> 1:05:43.440
I'm driving a digger!

1:05:46.443 --> 1:05:47.444
Stay here.

1:05:48.611 --> 1:05:51.364
We won't repeat
the tale of the tailor's wife.

1:05:51.531 --> 1:05:53.575
This time we'll defend ourselves!

1:05:57.412 --> 1:05:58.455
I won't stand for this.

1:06:12.510 --> 1:06:14.596
Harriet, where are you?

1:06:15.388 --> 1:06:16.473
I've been held up!

1:06:16.639 --> 1:06:17.557
Follow me!

1:06:26.483 --> 1:06:27.567
Hey!

1:06:31.529 --> 1:06:33.448
Wrong direction!

1:06:42.540 --> 1:06:43.583
Elfie!

1:06:44.459 --> 1:06:45.460
Elfie?

1:06:45.627 --> 1:06:46.586
Elfie!

1:06:47.504 --> 1:06:48.588
Where are you?

1:06:55.428 --> 1:06:56.513
Here!

1:06:56.679 --> 1:06:58.473
Are you okay?

1:07:00.683 --> 1:07:02.685
Sorry. It tastes disgusting.

1:07:09.651 --> 1:07:10.652
Help.

1:07:11.444 --> 1:07:12.487
Help!

1:07:14.572 --> 1:07:15.615
Bruno!

1:07:17.450 --> 1:07:18.618
Bruno! Darn it!

1:07:19.536 --> 1:07:21.412
Help me, please.

1:07:21.579 --> 1:07:23.373
He doesn't really deserve it...

1:07:23.540 --> 1:07:24.666
Let's go. Elfkin ladder.

1:07:33.466 --> 1:07:35.552
I'm sinking!
- Stay with us.

1:07:39.597 --> 1:07:40.515
No!

1:07:40.682 --> 1:07:41.724
No!

1:07:44.727 --> 1:07:46.646
No, Elfie!

1:07:48.481 --> 1:07:49.607
Elfie.
- Where is she?

1:07:50.650 --> 1:07:51.651
Oh no!

1:08:04.706 --> 1:08:06.541
We got you!

1:08:14.632 --> 1:08:15.717
The old pin in the butt trick.

1:08:16.509 --> 1:08:18.595
Amazing.
- You saved my life.

1:08:20.555 --> 1:08:22.473
You all helped me.

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:24.601
That's just what we do.

1:08:25.602 --> 1:08:26.728
What's going on now?

1:08:29.606 --> 1:08:32.525
The place is about to explode.

1:08:42.619 --> 1:08:43.661
No!

1:08:44.579 --> 1:08:46.623
My baking paradise.

1:08:47.665 --> 1:08:49.584
Everything is ruined.

1:08:51.544 --> 1:08:52.670
Admit it: you're happy.

1:08:52.837 --> 1:08:55.632
Remind me...
who wanted to destroy something?

1:08:55.798 --> 1:08:57.550
It was you.

1:08:57.717 --> 1:08:59.594
That's the way it's always been.

1:08:59.761 --> 1:09:01.679
No, that's not true.

1:09:02.597 --> 1:09:03.681
Don't you remember?

1:09:20.573 --> 1:09:22.784
It's time for you to finally get along.

1:09:24.577 --> 1:09:25.703
Elfie is right.

1:09:28.581 --> 1:09:29.624
It's not that hard.

1:09:29.791 --> 1:09:31.709
We Elfkins always used to think:

1:09:31.876 --> 1:09:34.671
"Humans? Who needs them?

1:09:34.837 --> 1:09:38.633
Humans? We Elfkins don't need them.

1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:40.593
Humans..."

1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:43.805
"...eat Elfkins for breakfast.
Hats and all."

1:09:47.725 --> 1:09:50.687
The truth is,
we've been missing you all this time.

1:09:50.853 --> 1:09:52.814
That's right, we just forgot.

1:09:53.606 --> 1:09:56.567
So if we can get on with you humans...

1:09:56.734 --> 1:09:59.737
...you two ridiculous humans can do it too.

1:10:13.835 --> 1:10:15.753
You dumb donkey.

1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:17.672
You idiotic...

1:10:17.839 --> 1:10:19.716
Sourpuss!

1:10:38.693 --> 1:10:39.819
Those cream spires!

1:10:42.697 --> 1:10:43.865
The pineapple tarts are ready.

1:10:44.741 --> 1:10:45.867
Hurry up, sleepyhead.

1:10:46.659 --> 1:10:48.619
Where are the chocolate Elfkins?

1:10:48.786 --> 1:10:50.830
Don't dilly-dally, you lazybones!

1:11:02.884 --> 1:11:04.844
Stop pushing, boy.

1:11:05.762 --> 1:11:06.763
Come back here!

1:11:06.929 --> 1:11:08.806
There's enough to go around.

1:11:10.725 --> 1:11:11.768
Will you be okay on your own?

1:11:11.934 --> 1:11:13.728
Of course.

1:11:14.687 --> 1:11:15.688
Have fun!

1:11:20.777 --> 1:11:21.861
Showtime!

1:11:33.873 --> 1:11:35.917
Time to start!

1:11:36.751 --> 1:11:37.835
Let the Elfkin Festival...

1:11:38.002 --> 1:11:39.754
"begin!

1:11:44.759 --> 1:11:47.720
And now for my masterpiece:

1:11:47.887 --> 1:11:48.930
a turnip cake!

1:11:49.722 --> 1:11:51.766
Not again.
- Gross.

1:11:52.767 --> 1:11:53.768
Just kidding.

1:11:55.853 --> 1:11:57.897
It really is a masterpiece.

1:12:02.944 --> 1:12:05.947
Look! It's me!
- I want the biggest piece...

1:12:14.956 --> 1:12:17.792
If any of you ever need help,

1:12:17.959 --> 1:12:20.920
now you know:
We're swift, smart and swoosh!
