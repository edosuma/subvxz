WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:05.639
Previously on ER:

00:05.673 --> 00:06.540
We miss you.

00:06.574 --> 00:07.475
I miss you too.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.177
Brian, why are you here?

00:09.210 --> 00:12.046
I feel like
he's not telling me stuff.
Yeah.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.415
Come on.
Let loose for a night.
I'll think about it.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.483
Who wants a drink?

00:15.516 --> 00:17.251
No, we're good.
Anybody?

00:17.285 --> 00:19.787
You should really take a cab
home right now, really.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.589
I was not aware
that I was flirting.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.624
I'm not stupid, you know.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.760
Mr. and Mrs. Riley
have legal custody.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.763
It's not going to be
for a long time, I promise.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.065
You've been lost?

00:31.099 --> 00:32.299
Haven't you?

00:39.173 --> 00:40.574
GATES:
All right, so
tell me again.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.077
Who were those
weird forest chicks?

00:43.111 --> 00:45.246
The Wilis, they're
the spirits of girls

00:45.279 --> 00:47.581
jilted in love,
left to haunt the woodland.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.084
And that Macarena
thing they were doing?

00:50.118 --> 00:52.320
Oh, they were trying
to make the prince dance

00:52.353 --> 00:53.687
until his heart gave out,

00:53.721 --> 00:55.389
but Giselle came
to his rescue.
Right.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.325
Yeah, well, I guess
that happens, huh?

00:57.358 --> 00:59.727
Oh, you don't like ballet.
Not about haunted

00:59.760 --> 01:01.262
girls in the woods.

01:01.295 --> 01:04.465
I like sugar plum fairies--
it's Christmassy.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.134
Well, this was actually
pretty groundbreaking.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.469
I mean, Gautier
created the whole idea

01:08.502 --> 01:12.140
of investing emotion and
sincerity in ballet.

01:12.173 --> 01:15.143
Uh-oh, you're one of those
smart girls, aren't you?

01:15.176 --> 01:16.844
You've only just noticed?

01:16.877 --> 01:18.146
I've been in denial.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.347
Oh, you'll get over that.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.681
Or else what?

01:20.714 --> 01:22.150
Or else, I'll make you dance

01:22.183 --> 01:24.218
till your heart gives out.
Oh...

01:27.921 --> 01:31.259
You know, I have
The Nutcracker DVD

01:31.292 --> 01:33.894
back at my place.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.563
It's got bonus features.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.237
How long you
been living here?

01:43.271 --> 01:45.306
Uh, two months.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.341
It sucks, huh?
Shut up, Kim.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.177
It's not that bad.
Yes, it is.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.544
Isn't it, Sarah?

01:50.578 --> 01:51.879
Yeah, it kinda sucks.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.615
Yo, losers, meet our friend.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.418
This is Sarah, she's new.
Hey.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.187
New from where?
Chicago.

01:59.187 --> 02:01.755
Chicago, that's dope.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.491
I haven't seen you around.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.527
Yeah, I'm not your year.
What are you?

02:08.496 --> 02:09.930
Sophomore.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.233
Cool.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.502
It's crazy in here.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.437
I'm gonna go out front.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.905
Wanna come?

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074

02:26.980 --> 02:29.350
(door closes)

02:29.383 --> 02:31.852
Come on in.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.588
It's, uh, very... dark.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.224
Oh, yeah.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.226
Look, I have one of these.
Watch this.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.828
Huh?
It's nice.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.263
It's not bad.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.532
It's, uh... it's
not bad at all.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.936
Is this Sarah?
Mm-hmm.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.672
Yeah, that's her
at Halloween a few years ago.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.675
You said she lives
with her grandparents?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.610
She's a beautiful little girl.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.916
Yeah, she is.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.566
The party's lame.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.668
You want to go for a drive?

03:22.670 --> 03:25.706
Here, give it back if
you're not going to smoke it.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.845
Well?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.947
Wait, I'm coming.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.350
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.426
You want some?

03:45.459 --> 03:47.495
Oh, no, I try not to.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.531
I think it's the way
God would want it.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.701
Oh, you know, the Rastafarians
consider it a sacrament.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.036
I'm very ecumenical.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.372
Mm.
Mmm!

03:59.307 --> 04:00.608
What?

04:00.641 --> 04:02.543
Was it something I said?

04:02.576 --> 04:05.313
Oh, no, this was,
this was great.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.947
"Great"?
It was nice.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.549
"Nice"?
You know, it was...

04:08.582 --> 04:09.917
fun.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.585
What did we just do,
go to Disneyland?

04:11.619 --> 04:15.022
You rocked my world, okay?

04:16.490 --> 04:18.858
But I don't like
sleeping over

04:18.892 --> 04:21.462
this early in a
relationship.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.896
Wow. All right, well, just

04:22.930 --> 04:24.932
leave the money on the dresser
on your way out.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.069
I still have to go.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.704
(phone rings)

04:30.738 --> 04:33.341
Oh, good, this is
my next appointment.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.344
Hello?

04:36.377 --> 04:37.911
Tony, I need you to come!

04:37.945 --> 04:39.747
I messed up.
I'm in trouble.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.048
Sarah, what hap-- slow down,
what happened? Where are you?

04:41.081 --> 04:43.484
I don't know!
I don't know where I am.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.986
Sarah, where are you?!
Tony, just come!

04:54.962 --> 04:56.497
I'm kind of busy, Dad.
I've been up all night working,

04:56.530 --> 04:58.466
studying for my history midterm.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.634
Yeah, I can tell you
look a little worn-out.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.870
Maybe you should just try
getting a little more rest.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.972
I just told you I've been up...

05:05.005 --> 05:07.408
Did you not-- did you not hear
what I just said?

05:07.441 --> 05:08.442
No, I heard you.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.511
I heard you. Sorry.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.845
I just wanted to check in

05:11.879 --> 05:14.081
and see if, um,
you had given any thought

05:14.114 --> 05:16.484
to what we discussed
the other day.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.454
If Obama wins, do you think...

05:20.488 --> 05:23.056
do you think there's going
to be riots in the streets?

05:23.090 --> 05:24.658
Brian, look, I wanted...

05:24.692 --> 05:25.959
I mean, 'cause, Dad,
people have to unify.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.762
Like, you know, right now.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.664
I've been reading
about Watts.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.633
I mean, it's just like--
do you remember that, Watts?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.968
Well, yeah, I-I-I mean,
I know about it. Yeah.

05:35.002 --> 05:38.839
White America
is so racist.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.041
It's... it's such a shame.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.477
Right.
I mean, this country, Dad,

05:43.511 --> 05:46.113
is a crock.
Yeah.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.115
Look, Brian...

05:48.148 --> 05:49.917
did you see that therapist?

05:51.919 --> 05:53.754
You want the answer
to your question, Dad?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.122
Is that what you want to know?

05:55.155 --> 05:56.957
The answer to your
putrid question?

05:56.990 --> 05:59.026
None of your damn business.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.695
Okay...
I have privacy rights,

06:01.729 --> 06:04.432
which means you need
to leave me the hell alone.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.633
Or else you can go to jail.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.568
Okay, okay.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.637
That is not what we're
talking about, all right?

06:09.670 --> 06:12.506
What we're talking about is--
I'm just asking you.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.841
I gotta go.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.544
Hey, look...
I gotta study.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.447
The, uh, this thing
is in, like,

06:19.480 --> 06:21.048
a couple of hours.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.783
I want to go to
the gym first.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.685
Okay, but look,
son, look,

06:24.718 --> 06:25.719
wait a minute.

06:25.753 --> 06:26.987
Can you just
talk to me, son?

06:27.020 --> 06:28.456
Thanks, Dad.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.824
Thank you so much

06:30.858 --> 06:34.928
for your paternal concern.

06:34.962 --> 06:39.166
And Dad? I hope one
of your patients

06:39.199 --> 06:41.068
stabs you with an AIDS needle.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.549
So you're back on, huh?

06:57.050 --> 06:58.919
Yeah, I took a few days.

07:06.694 --> 07:09.897
I, yeah, that's, uh,
I have a seizure patient.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.031
CT shows an AVM.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.800
I was going to admit
to Neurosurgery.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.868
Oh, right, good. Just make sure
that you call IR...

07:14.902 --> 07:16.504
I did that.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.607
Okay, good. Thanks.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.611
Hey, look, Abby...

07:23.644 --> 07:25.946
And Grady has a hip
dislocation in Three

07:25.979 --> 07:29.650
that he wants to run by you
before he sends to, um, Ortho.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.788
Okay.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.929
GATES:
She wouldn't go to the police.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.964
She wouldn't do anything
till I got to her.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.533
I don't see her.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.739
This guy...

07:53.206 --> 07:54.908
Hey, buddy.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.910
You know who Teri is?
I talked to someone named Teri.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.245
You here about
the little girl?
Yeah.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.880
She's in the back.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.096
It's okay.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.031
It's all right now.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.169
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.804
Take that.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.639
Hey, I haven't seen
you in a few days.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.908
You okay?
I'm fine.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.043
Are we okay?

08:30.077 --> 08:31.779
You know, that night
outside of Ike's,

08:31.812 --> 08:33.947
it got a little ugly.
Oh, that was no big deal.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.616
You haven't been
yourself lately, Abby,

08:35.649 --> 08:36.984
and I'm not the only
one who's noticed it.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.885
This place is a breeding
ground for gossip.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.921
It's not gossip,
it's more like worry.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.023
Well, maybe they should
worry about themselves.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.960
(sighs)

08:46.994 --> 08:49.329
It's just hard with Luka
not here, that's all.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.098
I'm fine.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.066
When is the big Croat
coming back?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.002
Well, he was going to try and
get a flight out today,

08:55.035 --> 08:56.604
so, hopefully, he'll
be here by tomorrow.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.806
Well, that should
make things easier.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.608
Yeah, it should.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.342
Marcus Faneca, 20-foot
fall from a ladder.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.911
No LOC, complains

09:03.944 --> 09:05.078
of chest and right hip pain.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.780
How'd thIS happen, Marcus?

09:06.814 --> 09:08.248
I was cleaning leaves
from the gutters.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.983
BP 100 over 60,

09:10.017 --> 09:12.620
tachy at 120, had two
of MS in the field.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.987
Hey, buddy, how
old are you?

09:14.021 --> 09:16.657
I'll be 13 in January.
Where are your parents?

09:16.690 --> 09:18.826
It's just my father.
He's coming behind.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.795
We couldn't fit the chair
in the rig with us.

09:21.829 --> 09:24.097
My dad's a paraplegic.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.734
He gave me a sip
of something out of a flask,

09:26.767 --> 09:28.035
and started touching me.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.970
Sexually?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.639
Yeah.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.645
It's okay,
you can tell him everything.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.649
So I reached down
and grabbed something

09:41.682 --> 09:43.150
on the ground,
and hit him with it.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.118
Hit him with what?

09:45.152 --> 09:46.253
I don't know.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.355
It was, like, metal,

09:48.388 --> 09:51.191
heavy, kind of like
an "L" shape.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.660
A tire iron?

09:53.761 --> 09:56.664
I guess so, maybe.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.065
You hit him with a tire iron?

10:00.367 --> 10:02.369
Okay, Marcus, we're going
to sit you up now.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.738
My dad, he might need help...

10:04.772 --> 10:06.339
getting in here.

10:06.373 --> 10:09.242
It's okay, the hospital's
wheelchair accessible.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.944
(Marcus groans)
A little more morphine?

10:10.978 --> 10:13.280
Uh, no, his
pressure's borderline.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.149
Another .250
of saline first.

10:16.183 --> 10:19.787
Small pneumothorax,
gonna need a chest tube. Okay.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.188
(groans):
Damn it.

10:23.857 --> 10:29.129
Okay, displaced femoral
neck fracture, right?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.864
You're asking me?

10:30.898 --> 10:33.901
No, that's what it is.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.936
Okay, I'll get
a Hare Traction.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.938
No, I want to try five pounds
of Buck's traction.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.039
You sure?

10:39.072 --> 10:41.775
Yeah, Sam, I'm sure.

10:43.911 --> 10:47.114
Sorry.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.850
Hey, pal, I got here
as fast as I could.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.719
How you doing?

10:51.752 --> 10:53.186
I'm sorry, Dad.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.188
I should've had the ladder
angled better.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.389
Oh, hey, no.

10:56.423 --> 10:59.693
No, th-that was not your fault.

10:59.727 --> 11:00.794
Are you his doctor?

11:00.828 --> 11:02.129
Yeah, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.398
So... what's the deal?

11:05.432 --> 11:07.801
Well, your son has
a collapsed lung.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.037
We're going to need to insert
a tube into the chest cavity

11:10.070 --> 11:12.072
to expand it while
it gets better.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.941
How bad is that?
Is that bad?

11:13.974 --> 11:15.242
Not too bad, it'll heal.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.777
He also has a fractured femur.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.779
What?
A broken hip bone,

11:18.812 --> 11:19.980
which the surgeons
will take a look at,

11:20.013 --> 11:21.849
and we're going
to try to reduce it

11:21.882 --> 11:24.251
under general anesthesia.
And if they can't,
then what?

11:24.284 --> 11:26.286
Well, why don't we wait
for the consult...

11:26.319 --> 11:27.855
Wh-what could happen?

11:27.888 --> 11:30.791
Sir, maybe we should talk
out here, huh?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.993
I'll be right back,
pally, okay?

11:43.070 --> 11:45.005
I don't think either
you or your son

11:45.038 --> 11:46.774
need to be
worrying about...
What?

11:46.807 --> 11:48.308
Worst case scenario?

11:48.341 --> 11:49.843
Why the hell shouldn't we?

11:49.877 --> 11:51.511
(removes gloves)

11:51.544 --> 11:54.782
Okay, avascular necrosis
of the femoral head,

11:54.815 --> 11:56.850
chronic pain, a total hip
replacement at a young age,

11:56.884 --> 11:59.352
he never walks normally.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.321
That's what I was afraid of.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.023
Mr. Faneca,

12:03.056 --> 12:04.892
what I'm trying
to tell you is,
Damn it!

12:04.925 --> 12:06.927
the surgeons should
be able to realign

12:06.960 --> 12:08.161
and stabilize
your son's leg.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.830
It doesn't need
to get to that.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.132
Yeah, like I've never heard
that before.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.533
ZELINSKY:
Two-layer closure?

12:13.566 --> 12:15.803
Yes. And what else?

12:15.803 --> 12:16.870
Oh, and a psych consult.

12:16.904 --> 12:17.905
The guy's a total nut job.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.306
Right, well, get on it.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.408
By the way, I need to be
out of here by 6:00.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.243
It's my girlfriend Lacey's
homecoming tonight.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.377
Big deal.
Right.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.479
MORRIS:
Go, go, Badgers.
What?

12:26.513 --> 12:28.916
That's their school mascot--
the Woodland Badgers.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.951
Americans.
You ready,
stallion? Huh?

12:30.984 --> 12:32.319
You got your moves
all worked out?

12:32.352 --> 12:33.921
Wait, wait, okay, let me see.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.523
First, you have
the yawn reach-around.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.891
(grumbly yawning)

12:37.925 --> 12:39.092
Nice.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.228
You yawn like a horse.

12:41.261 --> 12:45.833
Oh, then, there's
the earnest-emo shoulder hold.

12:45.833 --> 12:49.036
I really, really
care about you, Lacey.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.170
Oh, please.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.538
FRANK:
Is that even a move?

12:51.571 --> 12:54.507
And finally, the false
drop, intentional,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.877
accidental,
face-to-face.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.047
(chart thuds on floor)

13:03.316 --> 13:04.484
Oh, excuse me.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.520
How... how clumsy.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.857
Please, you're making me queasy.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.392
I'm letting him have the
sex machine for the big night.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.127
Oh, wow, I really
appreciate it.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.095
I got it specially detailed.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.529
You're gonna love it.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.865
I thought you were mad
at him about your car.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.032
Nah.
MORETTI:
Haleh.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.267
No more dings, okay?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.969
Can you go man
the Triage Desk?

13:22.002 --> 13:23.570
We got a backup
in Waiting.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.539
No, but I can "woman" it.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.876
Abby's bitching about where
Surge is for her chest tube.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.077
Yeah, we're on our way.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.211
Let her sniff
your hand first.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.445
Is there a problem?

13:32.479 --> 13:33.613
Uh, yeah.
What?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.215
Abby keeps going
like this,

13:35.248 --> 13:37.050
I'm gonna slap her
with a colostomy bag.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.152
At least I only have to
take it for a few more hours

13:39.186 --> 13:41.421
before I switch over
to my O.R. shift at noon.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.890
O.R. shift?
Mm-hmm.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.624
It's part of my
transpo training

13:44.657 --> 13:46.359
for intubation experience.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.561
Morris, go and
supervise, okay?

13:48.595 --> 13:50.230
Uh, maybe you should.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.565
I was just about to see
this "swimsuit model

13:52.599 --> 13:54.567
with knee pain
after slipping on runway."

13:54.601 --> 13:56.970
I'll take that.
You go deal with Abby.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.605
(sighs)

13:58.638 --> 14:01.508
Well, well,
look what the cat dragged in.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.143
Hah!

14:03.176 --> 14:05.212
Three centimeter incision
over the fifth rib.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.247
Uh... how's that?

14:07.280 --> 14:09.016
Good. (sighs)

14:10.918 --> 14:12.619
Okay, 36 French tube.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.388
RASGOTRA:
36? You mean 28, right?

14:15.422 --> 14:16.957
Right, sorry, 28.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.594
Tunnel over the
intercostal space.
Uh-huh.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.163
You all right?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.298
Yes, I'm fine. Why?

14:25.332 --> 14:28.235
It's just,
a kid under 50 kilos needs...

14:28.268 --> 14:29.536
I know what he needs.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.407
Another vascular clamp.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.043
Make it a curved vascular clamp.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.945
Are you're kidding me?
Okay, you know what?

14:37.945 --> 14:39.947
Neela, you want to show off
to your little sidekick here,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.048
that's fine, it's all you.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.415
What? What's wrong?

14:42.449 --> 14:43.483
RASGOTRA:
Uh, nothing.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.318
Everything's fine, sir.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.054
I stay superior
to the rib, right?

14:47.087 --> 14:48.521
Yeah, if you were
to go inferior...

14:48.555 --> 14:50.223
I could bag an
intercostal artery

14:50.257 --> 14:51.558
and then he'd
bleed out.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.426
How old are you?

14:53.460 --> 14:56.129
What I lack in experience,
I make up for in enthusiasm.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.530
What?
Yeah.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.232
This being my first
chest tube ever,

14:59.266 --> 15:01.034
I am really committed
to getting it right.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.435
You're kidding.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.037
Is he kidding me?

15:04.071 --> 15:05.238
This is a teaching
hospital and Dr. Zelinsky

15:05.272 --> 15:07.107
is a very
qualified resident.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.375
Well, I don't want him.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.043
I want someone
with more experience.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.279
Her-- why can't
she do it?

15:12.312 --> 15:14.547
Uh, hello?!

15:37.570 --> 15:39.239
I thought you were
coming home tomorrow.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.208
I caught an earlier
connection from Frankfurt.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.276
What?
Nothing. I-I...

15:43.310 --> 15:44.544
I just wish you'd told me

15:44.577 --> 15:46.379
'cause I would've
taken the day off.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.747
It was a last minute, so I
just thought, what the hell,

15:47.780 --> 15:49.349
I'd surprise you.
No, it's nice.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.617
Yeah?
Yes.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.684
Are you exhausted?

15:51.718 --> 15:53.286
No, I feel good.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.621
I just want to go
home and see Joe.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.423
You should definitely
go home and see Joe.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.391
I mean, Marnie probably has him
at swim class right now,

15:58.425 --> 16:00.360
but they'll be home
by the time you get there.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.362
I just wanted to
stop by and see you.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.031
The look on your face.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.366
And, uh, I got you something.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.667
You did?

16:07.700 --> 16:09.269
Mm-hmm.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.404
It's, uh, it's licitar.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.574
I know it's corny,
but it's Croatian,

16:14.607 --> 16:17.044
and it's what you're
supposed to get your girl

16:17.077 --> 16:18.345
when you haven't
seen her in a long time.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.114
And since you had
a blackout, I thought,

16:21.148 --> 16:23.750
you know, candle...

16:25.185 --> 16:27.154
You know, like...

16:27.187 --> 16:29.622
I missed you.

16:34.461 --> 16:35.728
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oops, sorry.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.164
Sorry.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.231
Hi.
You must be Dr. Kovac.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.666
Yes. I'm Kevin Moretti.

16:39.699 --> 16:40.700
Nice to meet you.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.435
Nice to meet you, too.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.204
I hear you've really whipped
the place into shape.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.440
Yeah, well, you know,
I've certainly tried.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.775
Well, uh...
So, how, uh...

16:48.808 --> 16:50.577
was your, uh... Sorry.
No, being...

16:50.610 --> 16:52.279
Being chief is a lot
of responsibility,

16:52.312 --> 16:53.780
and after we had the baby,

16:53.813 --> 16:57.184
I decided I'd rather spend
the time with my family.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.486
Yeah, well, yeah, I mean,
it's a tough job, but...

16:59.519 --> 17:00.620
Someone's got to do it.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.323
That's right.
Someone's got...

17:03.356 --> 17:04.391
MORALES:
I got an open distal
tib/fib fracture, contaminated.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.525
Five of morphine in the field.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.794
Okay, you'll excuse me.
Yeah.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.462
Okay, nice to meet you.
A pleasure.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.762
Nice to meet you, too.
Thanks. Bye.
Okay.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.433
Well, doesn't seem like
such a bad guy.

17:13.465 --> 17:14.800
No, he's all right, I guess.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.303
You called him
Mussolini.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.436
(laughs):
Yeah.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.440
Okay. I'll see you later.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.342
I'm gonna run by the desk,

17:22.375 --> 17:24.144
I got some souvenirs
for the guys.

17:24.176 --> 17:27.446
And when you get home,
I have a surprise for you.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.216
Luka.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.451
Hmm?

17:31.484 --> 17:33.586
I missed you, too.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.640
(sighs)

18:08.655 --> 18:10.723
(retching)

18:30.943 --> 18:32.645
Boy, you got some nerve,
don't you?

18:32.679 --> 18:34.281
You don't want to
start this, Hank.
I don't?

18:34.314 --> 18:35.548
Sarah got in trouble,
and she didn't call you.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.317
Maybe you should
think about that.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.585
Maybe you should think about
why she didn't turn to you

18:38.618 --> 18:40.453
when she felt like
she needed help.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.823
I know why-- because we have
rules here, and discipline.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.625
We don't just let her
talk or dress

18:45.658 --> 18:47.427
or do whatever the hell
she wants.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.461
BECKY:
Hank.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.929
Go finish with the horses.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.831
I can do that later.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.266
Hank.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.306
Sarah's taking a bath.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.674
She likes me
to wash her hair for her.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.842
More coffee?

19:02.875 --> 19:04.211
No, thanks,
we've got to go.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.378
Let's go, Julia.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.913
Where you from, Julia?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.217
I was an Army brat.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.551
My family moved around a lot.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.819
Mostly the Midwest though.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.221
What part?

19:14.221 --> 19:15.888
Indiana...

19:15.922 --> 19:18.258
and some time in South Dakota.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.393
I got some apples
that need peeling.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.528
How are you with that?

19:21.561 --> 19:25.232
Where's your paring knife?

19:29.702 --> 19:31.371
Hey, Abby.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.440
Sorry.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.308
We should talk.
We don't need to.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.543
Hey.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.610
Hey, what's going on?

19:37.644 --> 19:40.513
Hey. Uh, Mr. Faneca, I...

19:40.547 --> 19:42.282
Sorry. Excuse me.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.317
I was just reviewing
your son's chart.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.385
Yeah, well,
where did you go?

19:45.418 --> 19:46.886
You just left.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.521
Well, the chest tube was
placed, and I'm here now.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.656
Uh, repeat CBC is back?

19:49.689 --> 19:50.957
Hemoglobin's stable.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.360
Okay. Ortho ready for him?

19:53.393 --> 19:55.262
Still tied up
with an open tib/fib.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.696
I'm concerned
about his chest pain.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.998
(weakly):
It hurts when I breathe.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.901
Take it easy, Marcus,
it's going to be okay.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.671
Okay, Harold, I'll try.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.905
Should I repeat
the chest X-ray?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.840
Mm... no.

20:07.874 --> 20:11.311
Breath sounds are good,
sats are fine, BP's normal.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.345
Try four of MS.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.247
I'll try to get an ETA on ortho.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.648
So it's all good?

20:15.682 --> 20:16.949
Yeah. It's normal to
have a little bit of pain

20:16.983 --> 20:18.418
when you have a tube
in your chest.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.420
And the morphine
should help that.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.891
You know,
you-you seem distracted.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.460
Should I ask for
another doctor?

20:27.494 --> 20:29.262
Excuse me?

20:29.296 --> 20:31.764
I need you to fix this,
get things moving along here.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.333
It just seems like
we're wasting time.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.734
Just calm down, sir.
We're doing our best.

20:34.767 --> 20:35.902
We really are.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.638
Look, he's my kid, okay?

20:38.671 --> 20:41.374
He's all I've got.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.776
Guys, excellent.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.278
I need a little
fashion help here.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.380
You can say that again--
look at your tie.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.048
For Harold.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.917
Which one should he wear
to his homecoming tonight?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.485
Go black.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.586
All right, Sam,
that's what I'm talking about.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.987
The black's a little short,

20:55.021 --> 20:56.623
and Harold is lankier
than he seems.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.057
I was measuring
his inseam earlier...

20:58.090 --> 20:59.759
Oh! TMI.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.061
All right, I got to pick up

21:02.094 --> 21:05.932
a coledocojejunostomy
for Dubenko.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.567
Greg, what is up with ortho?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.436
We need to get that
roof fall kid up there.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.338
They were still working
on the tib/fib when I left.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.439
The washout was
a little gnarly.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.673
It's going to be
a bit longer.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.408
Hey, I heard
Luka was here.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.643
You told me he was
coming back tomorrow.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.044
Yeah, I know,
it was a surprise.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.347
Um, I kind of need
to hurry it up, up there.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.549
That's what I've been telling
them for the past 15 minutes.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.984
And thanks for taking care
of that chest tube.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.353
That was really Harold.

21:26.386 --> 21:27.987
Tell Luka I said hello.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.858
Hey, Benito left this stack
of preemptive orders

21:31.891 --> 21:33.660
for you to sign off on.

21:33.693 --> 21:34.861
Where is he now?

21:34.894 --> 21:36.829
I'm not sure--
he went to take a call.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.098
Something about his kid.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.967
You people
and your dysfunctional families.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.702
HALEH:
Hey, sir,
you just can't go in there.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.537
Thank you, luv.
A little help, mate?

21:44.571 --> 21:46.038
He's hurt his ankle
rather badly.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.607
Uh-huh, and how
did you do that?

21:47.640 --> 21:50.377
Cheese-rolling.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.711
Cheese-rolling?

21:51.744 --> 21:54.681
It's an old,
rather pointless,
pagan ritual

21:54.714 --> 21:56.749
that some of us in
the local ex-pat community

21:56.783 --> 21:58.985
periodically reenact.
They roll the wheel

21:59.018 --> 22:01.421
down the hill and then
you tumble after it.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.055
The first one down
wins the cheese.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.391
Morris!

22:04.424 --> 22:06.092
This one is all you!

22:06.125 --> 22:07.394
What can I do for you?

22:07.394 --> 22:08.761
He's hurt his ankle.

22:08.795 --> 22:09.929
Oh, wow-- wait,

22:09.962 --> 22:11.130
are you one of those
cheese-rollers?

22:11.163 --> 22:13.400
Yes, I am.
Cool, cool.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.435
I've read all about that,
let's find you a bed.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.103
Dr. Morris,
I heard you were looking for me.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.671
Yeah, go check out that
rack over there.

22:18.705 --> 22:19.939
Pick out a suit
for tonight.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.641
What? Really?

22:21.674 --> 22:22.975
Wow.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.644
Hey, are you a
cheese-roller?

22:24.677 --> 22:26.479
Yes, I am.
Sweet.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.415
So, you're the lucky
winner, huh?

22:28.415 --> 22:30.650
Enough Double Gloucester
for a year.

22:30.683 --> 22:31.751
You must be proud.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.152
He's quite a catch.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.587
(moans)

22:34.621 --> 22:37.690
Well... probably
just a sprain,

22:37.724 --> 22:38.958
but I'll get an X-ray

22:38.991 --> 22:40.560
to be sure, give you
something for pain.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.429
This won't
take long, will it?

22:42.462 --> 22:43.930
We really must
be on our way.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.132
We've got to pick up
some biscuits and mustard

22:46.165 --> 22:47.767
at the market.
I'll get you moving

22:47.800 --> 22:49.902
as I can, "guv-nah."

22:49.936 --> 22:51.103
(chuckles)

22:51.137 --> 22:52.138
On your way then.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.474
Good chap.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.177
Still waiting
on ortho?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.446
Yes, Doctor.

22:59.446 --> 23:00.813
Nice suit.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.882
You look... good.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.484
Oh, this? I have a date.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.785
But I wanted to check in
with my buddy Marcus

23:05.818 --> 23:08.788
before I sign out
for my big night.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.623
You rock, Harold.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.191
Pressure's down
to 80 over 40.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.493
What?

23:13.526 --> 23:15.194
(raspy gasping)

23:15.227 --> 23:17.564
Uh, harder to breathe.

23:17.597 --> 23:18.798
Oh, that's
not good.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.467
Sats are dropping.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.469
(gasping)

23:22.502 --> 23:24.070
Oh jeepers, subcutaneous
emphysema.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.171
(gasping)

23:25.204 --> 23:26.973
Go get an attending!

23:27.006 --> 23:28.475
No,

23:28.475 --> 23:30.477
you-you stay, help them--
I'll go!

23:30.477 --> 23:33.012
What's happening?
Marcus,
because of your fall,

23:33.045 --> 23:34.046
the air in your chest
is leaking

23:34.080 --> 23:35.214
into your neck
and torso.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.484
70 over 30.

23:37.484 --> 23:38.918
It's constricting his chest,
I need a ten blade!

23:38.951 --> 23:39.852
Come again?

23:39.886 --> 23:40.953
I need to open him up.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.088
He needs more
sedation!

23:42.121 --> 23:43.490
No, his pressure won't take it.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.091
And there's no time
for a local.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.659
Marcus, this is gonna hurt
a little bit, okay, buddy?

23:46.693 --> 23:47.760
I'm scared.

23:47.794 --> 23:48.861
Me, too.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.831
(crying)

23:52.865 --> 23:54.200
(screaming)

23:55.568 --> 23:56.669
Harold!
Harold!

23:56.703 --> 23:57.670
What are you
doing?
Wait!

23:57.704 --> 23:58.705
Oh, my God.
Harold!

23:58.738 --> 23:59.739
(screaming)

23:59.772 --> 24:01.040
(crying)

24:05.978 --> 24:08.548
(groaning eases,
breathing slows)

24:08.581 --> 24:11.250
Sats at 99, pressure's
120 over 85.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.085
Wow.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.825
(gently):
Sorry about that.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.164
Dude.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.168
That's a rental.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.910
Hey, they said you
wanted to see me ASAP.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.580
What's going on?
Yeah, um...

24:40.613 --> 24:42.048
housekeeping's gonna have
to clean up this sink--

24:42.081 --> 24:43.716
it smells like
somebody puked in here.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.885
Uh, yeah, okay,
I'll get right on that.

24:45.918 --> 24:48.054
Um, I have to go.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.789
Frank is working on
getting me a flight,

24:49.822 --> 24:51.624
but I'm gonna go to the
airport and just...

24:51.658 --> 24:53.225
wait.

24:53.259 --> 24:55.094
Okay.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.295
Where are you going?

24:56.328 --> 24:57.897
I'd like you to
cover the shift.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.732
I know that you've
expressed, you know,

24:59.766 --> 25:01.233
uh, the desire for
more responsibility

25:01.267 --> 25:03.570
in the past,
and, um...

25:03.603 --> 25:04.871
let's use this as
a trial run.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.706
Okay?

25:06.739 --> 25:07.940
Oh, okay.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.241
Thanks.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.710
Until when?

25:10.743 --> 25:12.011
I don't know.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.646
Um...

25:13.680 --> 25:16.683
I don't usually...

25:16.716 --> 25:19.151
let my personal obligations
interfere with my work--

25:19.185 --> 25:21.153
and-and I expect the same
of my staff--

25:21.187 --> 25:24.791
but... I, this, um, there's...

25:26.192 --> 25:27.860
Hey, you okay?

25:31.764 --> 25:33.800
It's my son.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.602
He's having a tough
time at school.

25:35.602 --> 25:39.071
He got very agitated during
an exam in a lecture hall.

25:39.105 --> 25:40.707
Agitated?

25:40.740 --> 25:42.809
And he accused the kid
next to him of cheating.

25:42.842 --> 25:45.812
And then when the professor
tried to intercede, he just...

25:45.845 --> 25:48.314
he lashed out at her.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.783
So...

25:50.817 --> 25:52.819
I...

25:52.852 --> 25:55.888
I'm sorry,
I didn't realize.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.958
Yeah, no, no,
I didn't either.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.093
Maybe I should have.

26:01.127 --> 26:05.732
All right,
if there's anything I can do...

26:05.765 --> 26:07.667
Thanks.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.337
All right, that's it.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.673
Okay.

26:19.846 --> 26:22.815
TAGGART:
Okay, here goes.

26:22.849 --> 26:23.916
Harold, why don't you
get changed

26:23.950 --> 26:24.951
and get out of here.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.252
You mustn't be late.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.820
Are-are you sure?

26:27.854 --> 26:29.188
But Marcus...
Yeah, you'll have plenty

26:29.221 --> 26:31.991
of other chances
to scrub in on O.R. cases.

26:32.024 --> 26:34.093
Okay, I see the chords.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.261
Tube.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.363
Only one high school
homecoming.

26:37.396 --> 26:38.665
Well, actually,
it's my third,

26:38.698 --> 26:40.366
but okay,
if you say so.

26:43.402 --> 26:44.904
Okay.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.173
I'm in.
Nicely done.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.240
Yeah, wow,
congratulations,

26:48.274 --> 26:50.176
Sam.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.344
Well, bye, Marcus.

26:52.378 --> 26:55.147
I'll check in
on you tomorrow.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.083
Well, it's a night
of many firsts.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.351
Let's keep our fingers crossed
for one more.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.020
Bye, everybody!

27:01.053 --> 27:02.421
What is taking so long?

27:02.454 --> 27:03.856
You should be
to the joint capsule

27:03.890 --> 27:05.024
by now.
What?

27:05.057 --> 27:06.158
Kidding.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.426
(quietly):
Ortho.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.695
Ten blade to...

27:08.728 --> 27:10.997
Neela. Rasgotra.
Trauma.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.099
Okay-- ten blade to her.

27:13.132 --> 27:16.235
Between the sartorius and
the tensor fascia lata, right?

27:16.268 --> 27:17.837
Trauma surgeons, so serious,

27:17.870 --> 27:19.038
I love it.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.140
Can we get some tunes
going in here?

27:22.241 --> 27:24.143
She's good at that, Tony.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.845
Must have some farm experience.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.413
Only a little.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.949
Oh, fold that right,
that's no good.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.785
Did you know Meg,
my daughter?

27:32.819 --> 27:34.120
No, ma'am, I didn't.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.722
She was good
at her chores,

27:35.722 --> 27:37.323
helping out
around the place.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.191
Then she got older,

27:39.225 --> 27:40.960
bored, a little wild.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.294
And she moved away.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.730
She doesn't need to know
all that.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.364
No, it's fine.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.465
I'm very interested.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.968
You're here,
you seem nice enough,

27:49.001 --> 27:51.804
maybe you can
help him understand.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.809
Understand what, Becky?

27:58.077 --> 28:01.080
Sarah's been changing--

28:01.113 --> 28:05.317
talking back, disappearing,
having trouble at school.

28:05.351 --> 28:09.155
She's becoming more and more
like her mother.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.456
Now we love her--

28:10.489 --> 28:12.859
and we never want to lose her
from our lives--

28:12.892 --> 28:16.262
but we're old, and we've been
through this once before.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.496
You fought to keep her.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.131
You're the ones who
wanted it like this.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.466
The child's not happy here.

28:20.499 --> 28:23.302
She's 13 now,
it'll only get worse.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.437
And we don't have it in us

28:25.471 --> 28:27.774
to go through again
what we went through with Meg,

28:27.807 --> 28:29.375
all the struggle.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.778
You never thought
about this before?

28:31.811 --> 28:34.914
We were grieving
for our daughter--

28:34.947 --> 28:37.249
looking for a way
to hold onto her.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.417
And trying to do

28:38.450 --> 28:39.351
what we thought was best
for Sarah.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.020
We made a mistake, Tony--

28:41.053 --> 28:43.956
but out of the best
of intentions.

28:43.990 --> 28:47.326
I don't want to punish her
because we were wrong.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.865
Much better.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.400
I knew the black one
wouldn't fit.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.235
I told those guys
you're lanky.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.204
This is pretty
hardcore.
Oh, yeah,
I like it.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.972
Ooh la la.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.340
Oh, can't be late.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.275
Don't want to keep
the little lady waiting.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.044
No, actually,
Lacey's five foot ten.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.378
She's on
the volleyball team.
Okay.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.380
Now, this is
for her wrist,

29:08.414 --> 29:09.548
so you don't have
to jump into

29:09.581 --> 29:11.183
the deep end right
off the bat.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.319
And this is nonalcoholic,
but you can always hope

29:13.352 --> 29:15.154
for the placebo
effect, right?

29:15.187 --> 29:17.824
I gotta get back
downstairs.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.859
My gimpy limey
cheese freak is waiting

29:19.892 --> 29:21.527
to get his ankle wrapped.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.897
I... I wanted to show Neela
before I go.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.565
All right, but
don't dawdle,

29:26.598 --> 29:28.467
or your chances of
getting some tonight
are gonna be ruined.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.270
Oh, I almost forgot!

29:31.303 --> 29:34.373
Remember, there's a reason
we have speed limits.

29:35.407 --> 29:36.542
Come here.

29:36.575 --> 29:38.144
Yeah, yeah.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.283
RASGOTRA:
Looks like
the perisoteum

29:44.316 --> 29:45.551
flipped into the fracture.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.353
GROSSMAN:
And we will flip it back out.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.021
Debakey.
First liter of NS is in.

29:49.055 --> 29:50.422
You want me
to hang another bag?

29:50.456 --> 29:53.025
Uh, don't bother, we'll
be done in a minute.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.226
Whoa!

29:54.260 --> 29:55.427
Whoa! Vascular clamps!

29:55.461 --> 29:56.896
Damn, damn,

29:56.929 --> 29:58.464
damn.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.399
TAGGART:
Pulse 144,
78 over 45.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.835
Okay, hang O-neg, saline,
whatever we've got.

30:02.869 --> 30:04.904
PVCs. Go as proximal
as you can.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.978
Hi.

30:13.946 --> 30:16.282
Something bad's happening.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.886
It appears the, the broken
bone injured the artery.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.087
Once they
repositioned it,

30:21.120 --> 30:23.022
the tear started
bleeding.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.323
It's rare, there's
no way the doctors

30:24.356 --> 30:25.391
could have
predicted this.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.558
How bad is it?

30:26.592 --> 30:28.094
It's bad.
I mean,

30:28.127 --> 30:30.129
the body's entire blood volume
can just--

30:36.969 --> 30:40.106
Dr. Rasgotra is a wonderful
surgeon, she'll save him.

30:46.312 --> 30:49.048
I thought you had
somewhere to go.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.619
Nah.

30:53.652 --> 30:55.321
I'm gonna stay
here with you

30:55.354 --> 30:57.456
until Marcus is okay.

31:18.945 --> 31:19.946
I'm sorry, Grandma.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.347
What about?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.983
The way I acted.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.018
Oh, listen here--

31:26.052 --> 31:29.255
you acted the way you needed to,
to make me see.

31:29.288 --> 31:32.291
I wasn't gonna see
it any other way.

31:32.324 --> 31:35.995
And now, things'll all turn out
how they're supposed to.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.631
So no being sorry.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.410
You watch her now.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.580
I'll be coming to Chicago soon,
so you be ready.

32:04.490 --> 32:07.093
He's gotta be
here somewhere.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.095
May I help you?

32:09.128 --> 32:10.129
There he is!

32:10.162 --> 32:11.630
MAN:
Hey!

32:11.663 --> 32:13.265
Aw, man.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.101
You stole my cheese!

32:15.134 --> 32:16.402
Oh, sod off!

32:16.435 --> 32:18.104
I won it fair and square!

32:18.137 --> 32:20.072
Gareth crossed the line first!

32:20.106 --> 32:21.507
Get off him,
you plonkers!

32:21.540 --> 32:23.642
We have proof,
you little slag!
Hey, hey!

32:23.675 --> 32:25.011
Bollocks!

32:25.011 --> 32:26.212
Break, break it up, guys!

32:26.245 --> 32:27.413
Get off!

32:27.446 --> 32:28.480
Ow! Ow!

32:28.514 --> 32:30.016
(grunting)

32:30.049 --> 32:32.018
David Beckham
is a wanker!

32:36.022 --> 32:37.556
(nervous laugh)

32:37.589 --> 32:38.624
Just kidding.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.161
Relax. Love the guy.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.429
Terrific.

32:45.431 --> 32:48.400
Okay, until
we decide

32:48.434 --> 32:50.036
the rightful...

32:50.069 --> 32:51.203
(grunting)

32:51.237 --> 32:54.306
...owner...

32:54.340 --> 32:56.742
I will be the keeper
of the cheese.

33:00.746 --> 33:03.615
Heard he was
flying out tonight.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.484
Frank's getting him
a flight.

33:05.517 --> 33:06.618
Really?

33:06.652 --> 33:07.786
Mm-hmm. Something
about his kid.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.188
Pretty serious,
from what I hear.

33:09.221 --> 33:10.322
It must be.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.058
Mind if I leave you
to this?

33:12.091 --> 33:13.692
I got to check
on Pratt's MI in Three.

33:13.725 --> 33:16.228
Sure. I got it.
Okay.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.197
HALEH:
See you soon,
Dr. Moretti.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.499
Okay. Sure thing, Haleh.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.605
(ambulance door shuts,
engine starts)

33:34.280 --> 33:36.182
Take care, Abby.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.652
Kevin?

33:42.854 --> 33:45.457
I hope everything works out.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.270
TAGGART:
Heparin's in.

33:58.304 --> 33:59.171
GROSSMAN:
All right. Good
flow, no leaks.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.846
We were able
to stop the bleeding

34:07.879 --> 34:09.648
and repair his artery.

34:09.681 --> 34:12.217
We have every reason to believe
he's going to recover fully.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.752
And the leg?

34:13.784 --> 34:15.587
Going to need a few screws,

34:15.621 --> 34:17.723
but in time,
it should be as good as new.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.858
(sighs)
Awesome.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.561
All right, kid,
get out of here.

34:22.594 --> 34:23.862
Are you sure?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.464
I wanted to see
if Marcus would...

34:25.496 --> 34:27.266
You-You can talk to him
in the morning.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.734
Go-Go to your thing.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.136
Okeydokey, then.

34:30.168 --> 34:33.672
Um, congrats
on a successful outcome.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.643
(door closing)

34:37.676 --> 34:39.411
Nice kid, that one.

34:39.445 --> 34:40.779
A little weird.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.248
Yeah.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.583
A little.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.152
GARETH:
That's Margaret.

34:47.152 --> 34:49.455
She saw
the whole thing.
Coming up

34:49.487 --> 34:51.322
right... there!

34:51.357 --> 34:52.858
MAN 3:
See? See? See?
Gareth won.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.525
LIONEL:
He passed out before
the finish line!

34:54.560 --> 34:56.428
He didn't.
After you pulled me down!

34:56.462 --> 34:58.297
Oh, poor Henry.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.565
They had to
cart him off

34:59.598 --> 35:00.899
in a stretcher.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.235
All right, all
right, all right.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.871
After careful
review of the tape,

35:05.904 --> 35:08.274
I am ruling it a tie.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.475
You each get half.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.243
You're gonna
cut the cheese?

35:11.277 --> 35:13.279
(laughing):
Well, I mean...

35:14.280 --> 35:15.581
Yes, that's right.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.383
Fine! Split it in two,
so I can go home.

35:17.416 --> 35:18.784
GARETH:
No! No, no.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.319
He can have it.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.521
The cheese should
not be divided.

35:22.554 --> 35:25.457
I would rather see it
absconded by a cheater

35:25.491 --> 35:26.725
than be split in half.

35:26.758 --> 35:27.759
I knew you'd cave.

35:27.793 --> 35:30.929
MORRIS:
Oh, not so fast.

35:30.962 --> 35:34.300
Gareth, the cheese is yours.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.567
Wait. But you
just said...

35:35.601 --> 35:38.470
Uh. According to the
wisdom of Solomon,

35:38.504 --> 35:40.939
Gareth has shown himself
as the true cheese-lover

35:40.972 --> 35:42.774
and its rightful guardian.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.810
He was willing to
forfeit the cheese

35:44.843 --> 35:46.612
rather than see
it torn apart.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.580
Oh, thanks
for nothing, Doc.

35:48.614 --> 35:49.881
(laughter)

35:49.915 --> 35:51.517
Yeah. What a bunch
of gits.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.718
Hey, tossers.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.886
Frank?

35:59.491 --> 36:00.792
Your, uh, roof kid's
doing well.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.628
They're moving him
to Recovery.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.297
Oh, great.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.633
Oh, well, I... I thought
you'd want to know.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.401
Thank you.

36:09.435 --> 36:11.270
Are we fighting?

36:11.303 --> 36:14.406
No. I don't think so.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.941
We're friends, right?

36:15.974 --> 36:18.244
We-We confide in each other?

36:18.277 --> 36:20.312
Yeah, we do.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.383
No. Forget it.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.954
Hey, Neela, hold
up, Neela... just...

36:32.824 --> 36:35.261
Uh, look, I know
I've been...

36:35.261 --> 36:37.563
I don't know, bitchy
or something lately,

36:37.596 --> 36:39.565
but I just hit
a rough patch,

36:39.598 --> 36:41.900
and, um... and
Luka's home now,

36:41.933 --> 36:43.469
so everything's
going to be better.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.673
I'm going to go
check on the Fanecas.

36:57.316 --> 36:58.650
Heard he's doing well.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.959
Um, listen...

37:09.928 --> 37:12.864
...I wasn't
attentive enough before.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.968
You were right
to be angry.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.771
Being angry's kind
of my baseline.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.311
I was 28 when
he was born,

37:25.311 --> 37:28.880
but I was still
a kid myself.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.749
I wouldn't grow up.

37:30.782 --> 37:35.321
I was reckless,
out of control.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.923
I had this sweet
Ninja ZX-9.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.725
Loved it.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.331
Kayla-- that
was his mom--

37:45.331 --> 37:48.734
she was riding behind me
the night I had my accident,

37:48.767 --> 37:51.537
holding on
around my waist.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.039
When I came
to, I saw her

37:54.072 --> 37:56.842
lying on the
pavement.

37:56.875 --> 38:00.512
I saw them pull the
sheet over her face.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.483
I did that.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.754
One stupid night.

38:15.361 --> 38:17.896
But you're a really good father.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.731
I can tell.

38:19.765 --> 38:23.001
I'm sure that makes up
for a lot.

38:23.034 --> 38:25.671
I don't know.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.373
You know, I've just...

38:27.406 --> 38:31.677
I've carried this thing
in my gut for so long.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.980
He spends all of his energy
trying to make me feel better.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.449
He's my kid.

38:37.483 --> 38:39.818
That's not his job.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.853
You know, you could try
to change that.

38:43.121 --> 38:44.890
You know, everybody...

38:44.923 --> 38:46.792
Everybody screws up.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.827
You know, just...

38:48.860 --> 38:51.863
try not
to make the same mistake again.

38:51.897 --> 38:54.065
There are some things
you can never fix.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.735
(wry laugh)

38:56.768 --> 39:00.706
You can't unring
a bell, they say.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.944
No, I guess you can't.

39:08.914 --> 39:12.418
(speaking Croatian)

39:12.418 --> 39:14.085
(laughter)

39:14.119 --> 39:15.654
Hey.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.155
Hey! Hey. Hi.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.625
Uh, so, this is
my surprise.

39:19.658 --> 39:20.759
Niko, this is Abby.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.060
Abby-- my brother Niko.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.663
Oh, hi. Wow.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.465
Wow, you didn't,
uh, mention that...

39:26.498 --> 39:28.467
After all these years,
we thought it was time.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.101
Niko's never been
to America before, so...

39:30.135 --> 39:31.570
I hope I won't be
in the way.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.439
Oh, no, not at all...

39:33.472 --> 39:35.541
I was just a little bit
surprised, that's all.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.075
It's nice to
finally meet you.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.578
Hey, uh, Joe's asleep, and
we have a pizza coming, so...

39:39.611 --> 39:41.012
Okay, great.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.448
You want some drink?

39:42.448 --> 39:44.750
No, that... I'll
get it, thanks.

39:44.783 --> 39:48.119
Um, so your
flight was good?

39:48.153 --> 39:50.856
Yeah, the Germans know
how to travel in style.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.958
We were lucky to make
connection in Frankfurt.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.160
Luka wants to give
you a big shock.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.095
Well, he did.

39:59.598 --> 40:00.999
(laughter)

40:01.032 --> 40:03.101
(conversing in Croatian)

40:36.768 --> 40:38.770
Welcome home.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.811
(sighs)

41:34.092 --> 41:36.061
Ow!

41:36.094 --> 41:37.563
(can thuds onto floor)

41:37.563 --> 41:39.731
(quietly):
Shoot... Shoot...

41:41.600 --> 41:44.570
(footsteps approaching)

41:45.971 --> 41:47.639
Hey, what are you doing?

41:47.673 --> 41:49.908
(whispers):
Nothing.
I sp... I spilled.

41:49.941 --> 41:54.245
(whispers):
Uh, Niko's almost ready
to go to bed,

41:54.279 --> 41:57.082
so we can be all alone,
just the two of us.

41:57.115 --> 41:59.685
Okay, I'll be right down.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.286
Okay.

42:01.319 --> 42:02.788
Don't wake him up.

42:12.097 --> 42:14.966
(crying)

42:15.000 --> 42:17.268
(sniffling)

42:22.307 --> 42:25.611
(crying)

42:25.644 --> 42:26.878
(sniffling)

42:26.912 --> 42:29.214
(cries and sniffles)

42:30.305 --> 42:36.160
