WEBVTT

00:04.972 --> 00:07.575
SO, BRAD, I WAS
THINKING ABOUT
OUR ANNIVERSARY.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.077
OUR ANNIVERSARY'S
NOT FOR MONTHS.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.313
YEAH, BUT WHEN YOU ADD
THE MONTHS WE WERE
BROKEN UP,

00:12.346 --> 00:14.182
IT'S THIS THURSDAY.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.516
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:15.549 --> 00:18.052
WELL, I GOTTA RUN
TO THE MALL...
BY MYSELF.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.820
NO, BABY, NO.
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WASTE YOUR WHOLE DAY

00:19.853 --> 00:22.790
RUNNING AROUND THE MALL
TRYING TO FIND ME
A GIFT.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.225
YOU DON'T?
NO!

00:24.258 --> 00:26.294
THAT'S WHY
I MADE YOU THIS LIST.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.762
NO WHAT--
WHAT IS THIS?

00:28.796 --> 00:32.600
WELL, I'VE WRITTEN DOWN
DIFFERENT GIFTS I'D LIKE
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.168
AND IF YOU DON'T WANNA
GO OUT,

00:34.202 --> 00:36.770
I'VE REGISTERED ONLINE
AT THESE 3 BOTTOM STORES.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.706
LILY, I--I DON'T
NEED THIS, OK?

00:38.739 --> 00:40.374
I'M A GREAT
GIFT GIVER.

00:40.408 --> 00:43.444
OF COURSE YOU ARE! HA.

00:44.245 --> 00:48.482
HEY, IT'S THE GEODE
I GOT YOU FOR
VALENTINE'S DAY!

00:48.516 --> 00:49.417
YES, IT IS.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.619
I GOT YOU THAT ONE
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY!
YEAH.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.521
DID YOU KNOW
THAT IT TAKES THE EARTH

00:53.554 --> 00:55.289
OVER 4 MILLION YEARS
TO MAKE A GEODE?

00:55.323 --> 00:57.825
I KNOW.
I READ THE CARD.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.227
PLEASE TAKE THE LIST.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.129
NO, I--I DON'T NEED
THE LIST.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.131
I'LL GET YOU
SOMETHING GREAT.
I PROMISE.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.699
I KNOW YOU WILL, BABY.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.205
HEY, MR. FINNERTY,
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
GO AHEAD.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.174
LILY AND MY ANNIVERSARY'S
COMING UP,

01:13.207 --> 01:14.542
AND I NEED TO GET HER
A GIFT.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.843
JUST WAIT. I'M SURE
SHE'LL GIVE YOU A LIST.

01:15.876 --> 01:20.114
NO, NO, I DON'T WANT
HER LIST. I WANT TO
CHOOSE SOMETHING MYSELF.

01:20.148 --> 01:22.616
WHAT PRICE RANGE
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.418
YOU KNOW,
LOW TO MID 2 FIGURES.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.886
WELL, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG
WITH APPAREL.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.623
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING.
WHAT IF I PRINTED MY PICTURE
ON A SWEAT SHIRT?

01:29.657 --> 01:31.492
I'M TALKING ABOUT
NICE APPAREL,

01:31.525 --> 01:33.461
LIKE A NIGHTGOWN
OR UNDERWEAR.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.696
I COULD PUT MY PICTURE
ON SOME UNDERWEAR!

01:35.729 --> 01:36.664
FORGET ABOUT
YOUR PICTURE!

01:36.697 --> 01:38.499
GO TO A NICE PLACE,
SEE WHAT APPEALS
TO YOU.

01:38.532 --> 01:42.203
OK. THANKS, MR. FINNERTY.
YOU WANNA GO WITH ME?

01:42.236 --> 01:43.437
LET ME CHECK
MY SCHEDULE. NO.

01:43.471 --> 01:46.240
HA HA HA.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
I LIKE THAT.

01:46.274 --> 01:50.244
Sean: STUPID FREAKING
GARBAGE CANS!

01:52.313 --> 01:54.182
HI, HONEY.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

01:54.215 --> 01:59.253
FINE. UNTIL I FOUND OUT
WE WERE LIVING
IN A POLICE STATE.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.357
FINNERTY.

02:03.391 --> 02:06.126
HEY, O'KEEFE.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.332
HEY, O'KEEFE,
YOU EVER GET
A LETTER

02:11.365 --> 02:13.234
FROM THE HOMEOWNERS'
ASSOCIATION?

02:13.267 --> 02:14.768
I DIDN'T KNOW
WE HAD ONE.

02:14.802 --> 02:15.836
YEAH, NEITHER DID I.

02:15.869 --> 02:19.207
"SEAN FINNERTY,
PLEASE REMOVE YOUR
EMPTY TRASH BINS

02:19.240 --> 02:20.674
"OFF THE SIDEWALK
AFTER TRASH COLLECTION.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.211
"THEY ARE DETRACTING
FROM THE APPEARANCE
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

02:23.244 --> 02:26.680
IF YOU DON'T COMPLY,
YOU MAY BE SUBJECT
TO A FINE"?

02:26.714 --> 02:27.881
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THIS?

02:27.915 --> 02:30.884
NO. IF THEY REALLY
CARED ABOUT HOW
THE NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKED,

02:30.918 --> 02:33.521
THEY WOULD HAVE
MENTIONED YOUR HAIRCUT.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.723
THAT'S FUNNY. HOW'S IT
ANYONE ELSE'S BUSINESS

02:35.756 --> 02:37.425
WHAT I DO WITH
MY STUPID BINS?

02:37.458 --> 02:39.760
YOU DON'T MESS
WITH THESE PEOPLE,
FINNERTY.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.395
MY COUSIN'S
HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION

02:41.429 --> 02:44.298
COMPLAINED ABOUT HIM
NOT CLEANING UP
AFTER HIS DOG,

02:44.332 --> 02:46.300
AND HE REFUSED
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.569
NEXT DAY,
THEY FINED HIM 1,000 BUCKS.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.303
COME ON!

02:49.337 --> 02:50.838
SERIOUSLY.
AND YOUR GARBAGE CANS

02:50.871 --> 02:54.208
ARE A HELL OF A LOT
BIGGER THAN CHIHUAHUA POOP.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.777
BUT HEY, IF YOU WANNA
TRY TO FIGHT 'EM,

02:56.810 --> 02:58.979
GO AHEAD.
IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.315
THEY WANT ME TO MOVE
MY STUPID BINS?

03:01.349 --> 03:04.418
I'LL MOVE
MY STUPID BINS!

03:05.386 --> 03:08.989
IS THAT WHAT
THE HOMEOWNERS'
ASSOCIATION WANTS?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.624
THAT LOOKS A LOT BETTER.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.593
WHO THE HELL
DO THESE PEOPLE
THINK THEY ARE?

03:12.626 --> 03:15.263
INVADING MY PRIVACY,
TELLING ME HOW
TO LIVE MY LIFE?

03:15.296 --> 03:17.565
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S MOVE TO A SOCIETY

03:17.598 --> 03:21.435
WHERE YOU AND YOUR
GARBAGE BINS CAN FEEL FREE
TO WALK DOWN THE STREET

03:21.469 --> 03:23.304
HAND-IN-HAND
AND NOT BE JUDGED!

03:23.337 --> 03:24.772
DID YOU SEE
WHO DROPPED THIS OFF?

03:24.805 --> 03:26.874
NO, I DIDN'T.
I'M GONNA FIND OUT.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.709
IN ALL THIS TIME
YOU SPENT WHINING
ABOUT THAT,

03:28.742 --> 03:30.511
YOU COULD HAVE JUST
MOVED THE GARBAGE CANS.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.246
OK, I'LL MOVE 'EM,
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:32.280 --> 03:35.283
I'M GONNA COME BACK IN
AND WHINE SOME MORE!

03:51.932 --> 03:52.866
SPECIAL DELIVERY.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.702
OH, BRAD,
WHATCHA GOT THERE?

03:54.735 --> 03:57.871
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR MY LADY ON HER
ANNIVERSARY.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.741
OH, THANK YOU!
IS IT OFF MY LIST?

04:00.774 --> 04:02.276
NO. I PICKED IT OUT
MYSELF.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.846
OH...THAT MEANS
SO MUCH MORE.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.382
NO, REALLY. OPEN IT.
IT'S GOOD.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.950
OK.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.755
OH, GOD, BRAD!

04:14.788 --> 04:16.557
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

04:16.590 --> 04:17.825
REALLY?

04:17.858 --> 04:18.626
YES!

04:18.659 --> 04:20.494
IN FACT, WHY DON'T YOU
GO DOWNSTAIRS,

04:20.528 --> 04:21.762
AND I WILL MODEL IT
FOR YOU?

04:21.795 --> 04:24.832
OH, THAT'S A FANTASTIC IDEA.
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE
THIS COLOR,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.800
IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE
IN LAVENDER AND NUDE, OK?

04:26.834 --> 04:29.803
YOU MIGHT JUST GET TO SEE
WHAT NUDE LOOKS LIKE.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.772
OH, I SAW THAT
IN THE STORE,

04:31.805 --> 04:34.808
BUT I LIKE THE
PERIWINKLE BETTER.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.413
LITTLE COLD OUT
TO BE PAINTING,

04:39.447 --> 04:40.581
DON'T YOU THINK,
O'KEEFE?

04:40.614 --> 04:42.015
THE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION
SENT ME A LETTER

04:42.049 --> 04:46.387
SAYING IT WAS AN EYESORE
AND IF I DIDN'T HAVE IT
PAINTED BY THIS WEEKEND,

04:46.420 --> 04:47.521
THEY WERE GONNA FINE ME.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.957
WELL, I THINK
AS SOMEONE WHO LIVES
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

04:49.990 --> 04:51.359
THEY HAVE A VALID POINT.

04:51.392 --> 04:56.364
THE FRONT OF YOUR PLACE
ALWAYS DID READ A LITTLE
NAVAL BASE WHOREHOUSE.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.297
VERY FUNNY, FINNERTY.

04:57.331 --> 05:00.801
YOU'RE A REGULAR
RED SKELTON, YOU KNOW THAT?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.436
DAMN IT!

05:02.470 --> 05:03.471
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:03.504 --> 05:04.204
THE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION

05:04.237 --> 05:06.407
IS SAYING MY FENCE
IS AN EYESORE.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.908
DON'T LISTEN TO THEM,
FINNERTY.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.877
I KNOW A LOT OF
CRACK ADDICTS

05:09.910 --> 05:13.614
THAT THINK YOUR HOUSE
LOOKS JUST FINE.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.883
HEY, MR. FINNERTY,
I WANTED TO THANK YOU

05:15.916 --> 05:18.819
FOR GIVING ME ADVICE
ON WOMEN WANTING UNDERWEAR.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.688
HA HA. HEY, I'M GLAD
I COULD HELP OUT.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.723
YEAH. LILY'S UPSTAIRS
TRYING IT ON RIGHT NOW.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.825
LILY. MY NIECE.
YEAH, LILY,
YOUR NIECE.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.595
I GOT HER A CAMISOLE
THAT'S SMOKIN'.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.364
UH...MY GODDAUGHTER.
I CHANGED HER DIAPERS.

05:30.398 --> 05:33.000
YEAH, YEAH, HER.
ANYWAY, IT'S GOT
SPAGHETTI STRAPS

05:33.033 --> 05:34.735
AND A PLUNGING NECKLINE--

05:34.768 --> 05:36.637
STOP TALKING
OR I'LL KILL YOU.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.571
GOTCHA.

05:37.605 --> 05:40.908
ANYWAY, GUESS WHO I SAW
AT THE UNDIES STORE?

05:40.941 --> 05:42.042
NICE CHOICE.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.379
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU SAW THE SIGN,
BUT IT'S 20% OFF.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.815
OH! COOL! MY DAD'LL
BE PSYCHED.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.717
IT--IT'S NOT
FOR MY DAD.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.719
I'M JUST USING
HIS CREDIT CARD.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.854
IT'S FOR MY GIRLFRIEND.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.689
MY DAD BUYS
TIGHTY WHITIES

05:55.723 --> 05:57.157
OUT OF THE BIN
AT THE DRUG STORE.

05:57.190 --> 06:01.795
COULD YOU CHECK TO SEE
IF YOU HAVE THIS
IN PERIWINKLE?

06:01.829 --> 06:02.963
SISTER HELEN?

06:02.996 --> 06:05.165
OH, HELLO, BRAD.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.066
UH...

06:06.099 --> 06:07.968
WHAT ARE YOU...
DOING HERE?

06:08.001 --> 06:09.537
BUYING A CAMISOLE.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.940
SERIOUSLY? I MEAN,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT--

06:12.973 --> 06:13.941
NUNS WEAR UNDERWEAR,
BRAD.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.444
YOU DIDN'T THINK
WE WERE ALL JUST
GOING COMMANDO

06:16.477 --> 06:19.480
UNDER THESE HABITS,
NOW, DID YOU?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.182
IT WAS SO WEIRD!

06:22.215 --> 06:25.419
IT'S ALWAYS WEIRD TO SEE
SOMEONE OF THE CLOTH
OUT OF CONTEXT.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.954
I ONCE SAW
FATHER FLANAGAN

06:26.987 --> 06:31.058
MOONWALK OUT OF
PETE'S TAVERN.
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.193
HEY, MOM.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.895
HI.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.865
HEY, JIMMY, COAT.

06:37.898 --> 06:38.832
SORRY.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.668
OH, YOU DROPPED
SOMETHING.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.436
YEAH, I KNOW. I GOT IT.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.103
WHAT IS THAT?

06:43.136 --> 06:46.139
NOTHING.
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.208
MAN, SOMETHING'S
GOING ON WITH HIM.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.276
MAYBE
IT'S JUST A BAG.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.779
I DON'T KNOW.
LATELY, HE'S BEEN
REALLY WITHDRAWN.

06:51.812 --> 06:52.780
THAT'S HIS PERSONALITY.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.915
NO. HE LOCKS HIMSELF
UP IN HIS ROOM ALL THE TIME.

06:54.948 --> 06:55.916
THAT'S HIS HOBBY.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.885
THE OTHER NIGHT
HE WAS WATCHING TV

06:57.918 --> 06:59.152
AND HE WAS LAUGHING
HYSTERICALLY.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.989
MAYBE HE WAS WATCHING
A REALLY FUNNY PROGRAM.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.724
IT WAS THE TELETUBBIES.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.859
YOUR KID'S A STONER.

07:05.893 --> 07:06.927
I KNOW.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.195
I GOTTA GO TALK TO HIM,
I GUESS.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.164
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE TALKING
TO J ABOUT THIS.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.900
WAIT. YOU DON'T KNOW
HE'S SMOKING POT.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.935
IT COULD BE
A NUMBER OF THINGS.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.070
LIKE WHAT?
HE COULD BE DEALING.

07:17.104 --> 07:21.174
LET ME GO TALK TO HIM,
ALL RIGHT?
I'LL SUSS IT OUT.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.209
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

07:22.242 --> 07:24.177
TRUST ME. I'VE BEEN
ON THE OTHER END

07:24.211 --> 07:26.947
OF THIS CONVERSATION
MANY TIMES
WITH MY DAD.

07:26.980 --> 07:27.981
YEAH

07:28.015 --> 07:30.551
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS BAKED.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.252
WHY CAN'T THEY
LEAVE US ALONE?

07:32.285 --> 07:33.954
WHO THE HELL
ARE T ANYWAY?

07:33.987 --> 07:35.556
IF I FIND OUT
WHO THEY ARE,

07:35.589 --> 07:38.492
THEY'RE GONNA GET
A SERIOUS TALKING-TO.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.727
OOH! A TALKING-TO.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.863
AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,
YOU CAN THROW YOUR
PANTIES AT 'EM!

07:42.896 --> 07:45.933
WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
GET 'EM FROM YOUR
MAMA'S HOUSE,

07:45.966 --> 07:49.069
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE
I LEFT 'EM.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.571
HEY, FINNERTY.
O'KEEFE.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.739
HEY, MRS. ROBINSON.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.041
IT'S NICE TO FINALLY
SEE YOU TWO WORKING
ON YOUR HOUSES.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.044
I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK
THIS END OF THE BLOCK
WAS ABANDONED.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.378
WELL, IT'S NOT
'CAUSE WE WANT TO.

07:58.411 --> 08:01.048
IT'S 'CAUSE THE STUPID
HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION
TOLD US WE HAVE TO.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.716
YEAH. I JUST GOT
ANOTHER NOTE

08:02.750 --> 08:05.686
SAYING I HAD TO TRIM
MY HEDGES DOWN TO 4 FEET.

08:05.719 --> 08:06.987
I'M DONE WITH THIS.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.055
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.791
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S WHAT I'M NOT
GONNA DO, O'KEEFE.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.926
I'M NOT GONNA
PAINT MY FENCE!

08:12.960 --> 08:14.928
YOU GO, GIRL!

08:15.796 --> 08:17.965
WHAT'S IN THE BAG,
JIM?

08:17.998 --> 08:18.932
NOTHING.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.901
IS IT POT?

08:20.934 --> 08:23.971
YES. YEAH. YES.
YEAH, IT'S POT.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.606
I'M...I'M BUSTED.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.174
I'M A HUGE POT HEAD.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.944
WHY DOES YOUR WEED
HAVE ONIONS ON IT?

08:30.978 --> 08:34.682
IT'S A...
OK, IT'S A VEGETARIAN
MEATLOAF.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.649
YOU'RE A VEGETARIAN?

08:35.683 --> 08:36.984
YEAH, I STOPPED
EATING MEAT LIKE
3 WEEKS AGO.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.086
WHY YOU HIDING THAT
FROM YOUR FOLKS?

08:39.119 --> 08:40.788
THEY DON'T HAVE A HISTORY

08:40.821 --> 08:44.157
OF EMBRACING
MY PERSONAL CHOICES.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.962
HOWDY, PARTNER!

08:50.831 --> 08:52.132
READY TO MOSEY
ON TO SCHOOL?

08:52.165 --> 08:57.070
I RECKON YOU WANT ME
TO RUSTLE YOU UP
SOME LUNCH.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.110
GOT IT. SO...
IF YOU'RE NOT
SMOKIN' POT,

09:03.143 --> 09:05.846
WHY WERE YOU LAUGHING
AT THE TELETUBBIES?

09:05.879 --> 09:06.947
OH...

09:06.980 --> 09:11.118
DIPSY TRIPPED OVER PO
AND FELL INTO THE FLOWER GARDEN.

09:16.356 --> 09:20.160
YOUR KID'S NOT A POT HEAD.
HE'S A VEGETARIAN.

09:20.193 --> 09:20.928
YOU'RE KIDDING.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.263
NO. HE HASN'T HAD MEAT
FOR 3 WEEKS.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.698
SO WHY WOULDN'T HE
JUST TELL US THAT?

09:24.732 --> 09:29.102
APPARENTLY, YOU GUYS
HAVEN'T BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE
OF HIS PERSONAL CHOICES.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.904
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

09:30.938 --> 09:33.240
COWBOY BOOTS.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.407
OH...

09:34.441 --> 09:38.178
GOD, POOR JIMMY.
SO HE THOUGHT HE HAD
TO HIDE IT FROM US?

09:38.211 --> 09:39.079
WAIT A SECOND.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.649
WHY WAS HE LAUGHING
AT TELETUBBIES?

09:41.682 --> 09:44.351
DIPSY TRIPPED OVER PO.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.121
HEY, DID YOU FIX
THE FENCE?

09:48.155 --> 09:50.090
NOPE. AND I'M NOT
GOING TO.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.726
SEAN, THAT ASSOCIATION
IS GONNA FINE YOU.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.629
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHAT A CONCERNED
GROUP OF CITIZENS

09:55.663 --> 09:57.931
THINKS ABOUT MAKING
MY HOUSE LOOK NICER.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.232
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AGREE!

09:59.266 --> 10:01.802
WHAT IF EVERYONE
ON THIS BLOCK STARTED
MAKING THEIR HOUSE NICER?

10:01.835 --> 10:05.806
PRETTY SOON PROPERTY VALUES
WOULD GO UP, IT MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE A NICE PLACE TO LIVE.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.776
I SAY WE FIGHT IT.
LET'S GO OUT AND BURN
A TIRE ON THE FRONT LAWN!

10:08.809 --> 10:10.077
AREN'T YOU THE LEAST
BIT UPSET

10:10.110 --> 10:12.045
THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING
TO TELL US WHAT TO DO?

10:12.079 --> 10:13.747
IF IT'S GOOD
FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD...

10:13.781 --> 10:14.982
OK, FINE, I'LL GO PAINT
THE FENCE!

10:15.015 --> 10:20.187
BUT THAT'S THE LAST THING
I DO TO MAKE THIS HOUSE
LOOK NICE!

10:21.388 --> 10:24.692
Lily, sexily:
COME ON IN, BRAD.

10:25.158 --> 10:28.061
YOU WANNA SEE
THE GIFT YOU GOT ME?

10:28.095 --> 10:29.830
BRING IT ON.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.102
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BRAD?

10:35.135 --> 10:38.005
I--IT'S--O...K.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.040
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE IT
OFF ME?

10:40.073 --> 10:41.909
NO!!

10:42.743 --> 10:45.645
WHAT A JERK!

10:50.250 --> 10:51.251
JIMMY, HEY.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.352
HEY, MOM.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.855
SO...LOOK WHAT
I'M EATING.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.056
YEAH. A CARROT.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.991
MM-MM. A FREE-RANGE
CARROT.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.727
AND NOT A BABY CARROT,
EITHER.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.130
THIS CARROT LIVED
A FULL LIFE AND WAS
PICKED HUMANELY

11:03.163 --> 11:04.998
BY NON-EXPLOITED
WORKERS.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.867
THAT'S ALL I KNOW
ABOUT THIS CARROT.

11:06.900 --> 11:10.771
OH. WOW. I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU WERE SO INTO
CARROTS' RIGHTS. COOL.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.841
I--I JUST FIGURED
SINCE YOU'RE
A VEGETARIAN--

11:13.874 --> 11:15.709
WHAT? UNCLE EDDIE
TOLD YOU?!

11:15.743 --> 11:19.079
IT'S OK! LISTEN, IT'S OK.
I COMPLETELY SUPPORT YOU.

11:19.112 --> 11:19.847
OH, YEAH. RIGHT.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.382
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE
THE COWBOY BOOTS

11:22.415 --> 11:26.219
OR THE TAE-BO
OR THE WRIST BANDS.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.990
I FORGOT ABOUT
THE WRIST BANDS.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.859
THIS IS DIFFERENT,
THOUGH.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.026
THIS IS COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.128
YOU'VE DECIDED
TO MAKE A LIFESTYLE CHANGE.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.230
THIS FAMILY
IS COMPLETELY BEHIND YOU.

11:37.264 --> 11:41.935
IN FACT, I'M COOKING UP
SOME VEGETARIAN DINNER
RIGHT NOW.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.937
THANKS, MOM.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.441
HA HA. WRIST BANDS.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.077
HEY.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.879
HEY, MOM. BRAD DIDN'T
HAPPEN TO STOP BY, DID HE?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.113
WHY, YOU GUYS DIDN'T
WALK HOME TOGETHER?

11:53.146 --> 11:57.017
NO! HARDLY SEEN HIM AT ALL
IN THE LAST 2 DAYS.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.353
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, MOM.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.255
OK, WHEN YOU AND DADDY
WERE DATING,

12:02.289 --> 12:05.525
WAS THERE EVER A TIME
WHEN HE DIDN'T...

12:05.558 --> 12:07.160
WANT TO TOUCH YOU?

12:07.194 --> 12:08.762
NO!

12:08.796 --> 12:12.232
OK. WERE THERE EVER
LIKE A COUPLE OF DAYS?

12:12.265 --> 12:12.933
NO.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.903
DID AN HOUR
EVER GO BY THAT--

12:15.936 --> 12:17.004
NO.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.972
WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD
ASK SOMEONE

12:19.006 --> 12:22.042
WHO ISN'T MARRIED
TO A RABBIT!

12:22.075 --> 12:23.043
HEY, BABE.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.012
I WANT YOU TO READ
THIS LETTER

12:25.045 --> 12:27.047
I WROTE TO THE HOMEOWNERS'
ASSOCIATION.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.849
WHY'D YOU WRITE 'EM
A LETTER?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.217
I WAS SICK OF ALL
THEIR STUPID NOTES.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.920
JUST READ IT OUT LOUD
SO I CAN HEAR HOW IT SOUNDS.

12:32.953 --> 12:36.089
"I, CLAUDIA FINNERTY,
AM A LYING...SACK OF LIES.

12:36.123 --> 12:39.159
"SIGNED, CLAUDIA FINNERTY.
LIAR.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.962
P.S., I'M ALSO CRAZY."

12:43.230 --> 12:44.932
HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.033
OH, YOU LEFT A TRAIL.

12:46.066 --> 12:49.069
Sean, voice-over:
YOU CAN SHOVE
ALL MY GARBAGE BINS

12:49.102 --> 12:50.570
AND MY UNPAINTED FENCE

12:50.603 --> 12:54.341
UP YOUR COLLECTIVE
HOMEOWNING ASSES.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.978
SINCERELY, SEAN FINNERTY.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.947
PRINT.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.286
OOPS.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.389
"HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION"?

13:09.422 --> 13:12.960
"O'KEEFE FENCE,
ROBINSON MAILBOX,
SEAN FRONT LAWN--"

13:12.993 --> 13:14.361
OH, GOD! SHE'S FREAKING NUTS!

13:14.394 --> 13:16.029
YOU'RE FREAKIN' NUTS!

13:16.063 --> 13:17.497
I'M NOT THAT NUTS, OK?

13:17.530 --> 13:19.833
ANY TIME I EVER ASK YOU
TO DO ANYTHING
AROUND HERE,

13:19.867 --> 13:22.569
YOU SAY, "OH, YEAH,
I'LL GET TO IT,"
AND YOU NEVER GOT TO IT.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.504
SO YOU CREATE THIS FAKE
HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION

13:24.537 --> 13:27.507
TO SCARE ME INTO
DOING THINGS
IS THAT IT?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.342
IT DID.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.044
OH, YEAH.
OK, BUT THEN YOU THOUGHT,

13:31.078 --> 13:32.445
"I, CLAUDIA FINNERTY,
CAN'T STOP THERE!

13:32.479 --> 13:36.049
"NO, I HAVE TO CONTROL
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD
THROUGH FEAR!" IS THAT IT?

13:36.083 --> 13:38.185
ALL RIGHT. MAYBE
I GOT A LITTLE DRUNK
ON POWER.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.855
BUT IT WORKED OUT.
I MEAN, LOOK AT OUR BLOCK.
IT'S NEVER LOOKED NICER.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.590
I FIGURE WITH
A COUPLE MORE NOTES,

13:43.623 --> 13:46.226
I CAN GET O'KEEFE
TO PUT UP NEW FLOWER BOXES.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.694
OK, ONE SMALL GLITCH.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.964
THE NEIGHBORS ARE GONNA
HANG THE PRESIDENT OF
THE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION

13:50.998 --> 13:53.000
IF SHE SENDS OUT
ANY MORE LETTERS!

13:53.033 --> 13:54.167
HE.
WHAT?

13:54.201 --> 13:56.269
IF SENDS OUT
ANY MORE LETTERS.

13:56.303 --> 13:59.039
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE ASSOCIATION
IS A MAN.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.074
CHARLES VAN LESSING.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.210
NICE TOUCH.
THANK YOU.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.012
OK. NO MORE LETTERS.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.313
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.148
I'M GOING TO THE DELI.
DO WE NEED ANYTHING?

14:08.181 --> 14:12.319
YEAH. SEE IF THEY HAVE
MUNG BEANS AND ORGANIC
TOFU--THE WET KIND.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.255
OK. SO NO.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.129
HEY, MR. FINNERTY.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.064
HEY, BRAD. WHAT'S UP?

14:24.097 --> 14:24.998
WELL...

14:25.032 --> 14:27.267
I'M STILL HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH THE WHOLE...

14:27.300 --> 14:29.136
SISTER HELEN
UNDERWEAR THING.

14:29.169 --> 14:29.836
WHAT PROBLEMS?

14:29.869 --> 14:32.906
WELL, NOW WHENEVER
I SEE LILY,

14:32.940 --> 14:33.941
I PICTURE SISTER HELEN,

14:33.974 --> 14:36.509
AND IT'S AFFECTING
MY ABILITY
TO INITIATE LIFTOFF.

14:36.543 --> 14:40.280
DON'T YOU HAVE SOME
FRIENDS THAT YOU COULD
TALK TO ABOUT THIS?

14:40.313 --> 14:42.916
WELL, THE THING IS
WITH MY FRIENDS...

14:42.950 --> 14:46.253
THEIR MISSIONS
HAVE ALL BEEN, YOU KNOW,
SIMULATED.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.454
IT'S ALL IN YOUR MIND.

14:47.487 --> 14:51.524
WHICH MEANS IT CAN BE
TAKEN OUT OF YOUR MIND.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.026
OK. HOW?

14:53.060 --> 14:54.327
IT'S ALL ABOUT FOCUS,
ALL RIGHT?

14:54.361 --> 14:56.163
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO CAN WALK THROUGH
WALLS

14:56.196 --> 14:59.132
JUST BY IMAGINING
THE SPACE IN BETWEEN
THE MOLECULES.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.168
THERE'S SOMEONE WHO CAN
WALK THROUGH A WALL?

15:01.201 --> 15:03.136
OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S A WALL.

15:03.170 --> 15:08.041
BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO NOT PICTURE YOUR
GIRLFRIEND AS A NUN.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.177
ALL RIGHT. OK.

15:10.210 --> 15:13.213
THANKS, MR. FINNERTY.
I APPRECIATE IT.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.683
NEXT TIME.

15:17.985 --> 15:21.588
YOU ARE OUTTA CONTROL!

15:33.566 --> 15:35.202
HEY, FINNERTY.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.169
HEY, DAN.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.704
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:37.737 --> 15:39.339
HUH? OH, UH, I--
I WAS AT THE DELI,

15:39.372 --> 15:41.574
AND I WAS TRYING
TO PICK UP SOME
MUNG BEANS,

15:41.608 --> 15:45.578
AND THEY WERE OUT,
SO I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD LEND ME...

15:45.612 --> 15:46.213
A PACK.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.215
NAH. I DON'T EAT
THAT CRAP.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.682
IT WREAKS HAVOC
ON MY COLON.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.251
CONNIE EATS
THAT STUFF, THOUGH.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.585
THE NOISES
THAT WOMAN MAKES...

15:52.619 --> 15:56.489
TO BE HONEST,
IT'S LIKE SLEEPING
NEXT TO A TUGBOAT.

15:56.523 --> 15:57.824
OK, WELL, TAKE CARE.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.627
HOLD ON! DID YOU
EVER GET IN TOUCH WITH
THE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION?

16:00.660 --> 16:04.431
OH! YEAH, YEAH.
I CALLED THEM AND I
STRAIGHTENED EVERYTHING OUT,

16:04.464 --> 16:05.398
SO IT'S ALL GOOD.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.200
OK, BUT IF I GET
ANOTHER LETTER,

16:07.234 --> 16:10.470
I'M GONNA BE PUTTING
SOMEONE'S PLUMS
IN A VICE.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.305
OK.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.244
I CAN EXPLAIN!

16:17.277 --> 16:18.511
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN, FINNERTY,

16:18.545 --> 16:21.348
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE FREAK
WHO'S BEEN SENDING
THESE DAMN LETTERS!

16:21.381 --> 16:23.616
NO! I'M TRYING
TO PROTECT THE FREAK
THAT IS!

16:23.650 --> 16:25.385
WHO IS IT?
I WANNA KNOW WHO HE IS!
IT'S A SHE.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.619
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU RATTED ME OUT!

16:26.653 --> 16:29.122
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
YOU PUT ME IN A TERRIBLE
POSITION!

16:29.156 --> 16:30.457
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD'S
GONNA HATE ME!

16:30.490 --> 16:34.461
THEY'RE GONNA HATE ME
MORE THAN THE LADY WHO
PUT OUT RACCOON FOOD!

16:34.494 --> 16:37.730
IF YOU PROMISE ME
THAT YOU WILL NEVER,
EVER, EVER

16:37.764 --> 16:39.399
DO ANYTHING THAT CRAZY
AGAIN,

16:39.432 --> 16:41.101
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.103
HOW CAN YOU TAKE CARE
OF IT?

16:43.136 --> 16:44.171
JUST PROMISE ME!

16:44.204 --> 16:45.038
FINE. I PROMISE

16:45.072 --> 16:46.706
I'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING
THAT CRAZY AGAIN.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.175
NO MORE LETTERS
OR TELEGRAMS OR--

16:48.208 --> 16:50.443
YES, I SWEAR.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
TAKE CARE OF IT?

16:50.477 --> 16:52.812
IT'S ALREADY BEEN
TAKEN CARE OF.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.447
I KNOW IT WAS YOU,
YOU FREAK!

16:54.481 --> 16:58.151
GET OFF MY PROPERTY,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

16:58.185 --> 17:01.221
GO AHEAD AND MAKE ME,
CRAZY LADY!

17:01.254 --> 17:03.056
OK, I WILL!

17:03.090 --> 17:04.424
HA HA HA HA HA!

17:04.457 --> 17:05.392
OH, CRAP!

17:05.425 --> 17:09.096
HA HA HA HA!

17:09.129 --> 17:12.199
NICE! YOU KNOW,
I THINK THERE
MIGHT BE A PLACE

17:12.232 --> 17:15.302
FOR A GUY LIKE YOU
IN THE HOMEOWNERS'
ASSOCIATION.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.469
HA HA. FORGET IT!

17:16.503 --> 17:19.439
COME ON!
VAN LESSING'S NOT GONNA
LIVE FOREVER, YOU KNOW.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.609
HE'S GOT A BAD TICKER.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.745
JUST FOCUS, BRAD.

17:25.778 --> 17:29.216
YOU CAN WALK THROUGH
WALLS.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.087
WOW!

17:36.256 --> 17:36.856
OH--

17:36.889 --> 17:38.258
BRAD, WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN?

17:38.291 --> 17:40.293
YOU DON'T COME OVER ANYMORE.
YOU AVOID ME!

17:40.327 --> 17:42.229
THE ONLY TIME
I'VE SEEN YOU IS YESTERDAY

17:42.262 --> 17:44.331
WHEN YOU TRIED TO HOLD
SISTER HELEN'S HAND.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.234
WELL, YEAH, THAT'S
BECAUSE I THOUGHT--

17:47.267 --> 17:48.301
NEVER MIND.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.702
BRAD, ARE YOU NOT
INTO ME ANYMORE?

17:49.736 --> 17:52.872
NO! I AM INTO YOU.
IT'S NOTHING, OK?

17:52.905 --> 17:54.474
I PROMISE.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.277
OK. 'CAUSE I MISSED YOU.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.712
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.584
AAH!

18:04.617 --> 18:06.219
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

18:06.253 --> 18:08.855
AREN'T YOU ATTRACTED
TO ME ANYMORE?

18:08.888 --> 18:12.359
WH--OF COURSE I AM!

18:13.393 --> 18:15.228
THEN KISS ME, DAMN IT!

18:15.262 --> 18:18.431
FOCUS, BRAD, FOCUS!

18:21.334 --> 18:22.869
WOW!

18:22.902 --> 18:24.171
IT'S YOU!

18:24.204 --> 18:26.473
WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE?

18:26.506 --> 18:28.475
SISTER HELEN?

18:28.508 --> 18:29.909
WHAT?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.878
LOOK, IT--IT'S A LONG
STORY,

18:31.911 --> 18:34.314
BUT--OK--YOUR UNCLE
EDDIE SUGGESTED

18:34.347 --> 18:36.649
THAT I GET YOU
UNDERWEAR
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.852
BUT AT THE STORE,
I SAW SISTER HELEN
BUYING THE SAME THING,

18:39.886 --> 18:42.655
SO THEN EVERY TIME
I SAW YOU, I THOUGHT
OF SISTER HELEN,

18:42.689 --> 18:44.924
WHICH IS WHY I COULDN'T,
YOU KNOW, GET IT GOIN'!

18:44.957 --> 18:48.395
MY UNCLE TOLD YOU
TO GET ME UNDERWEAR?

18:48.428 --> 18:49.629
YEAH. HE WAS GREAT!

18:49.662 --> 18:51.664
AND WHEN I WAS HAVING...
TROUBLE,

18:51.698 --> 18:54.267
HE TOLD ME TO FOCUS
AND I DID,

18:54.301 --> 18:57.404
AND HE WAS RIGHT,
AND IT'S GREAT!

18:57.670 --> 18:59.439
MY UNCLE KNOWS
ABOUT ALL THIS?

18:59.472 --> 19:03.410
YEAH. HE SAID THAT
IF YOU CAN PUT SOMEONE
IN YOUR MIND,

19:03.443 --> 19:04.844
YOU CAN TAKE 'EM OUT.
UH-HUH.

19:04.877 --> 19:08.381
SO NOW THAT I'M OVER
MY THING, WANNA MAKE OUT?

19:08.781 --> 19:11.351
COME ON,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

19:11.384 --> 19:13.686
LET'S CELEBRATE
OUR ANNIVERSARY.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.355
GET OUT!

19:15.388 --> 19:17.424
WHAT'S WRONG, BABY?!

19:17.457 --> 19:18.458
GO!

19:18.491 --> 19:20.727
CAN'T WE JUST CUDDLE
AT LEAST?

19:20.760 --> 19:23.430
OUT!

19:23.963 --> 19:27.734
KIDS, SEAN, DINNER!

19:28.868 --> 19:30.970
THIS CHICKEN'S
NOT BAD, CLAUDIA.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.874
ACTUALLY, THAT'S
RECONSTITUTED BEAN CURD.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.410
IT'S GOOD.
I HAD IT FOR LUNCH,
THOUGH.

19:37.444 --> 19:40.413
OK. EVERYTHING HERE
IS 100% VEGETARIAN.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.582
WE HAVE CABBAGE SOUP,

19:42.615 --> 19:45.218
WE HAVE SALAD
WITH CRUMBLED FAKIN',

19:45.252 --> 19:49.422
AND WE HAVE TOFU
PRESSED INTO THE SHAPE
OF A DUCK.

19:49.456 --> 19:53.393
WOW. Y-YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.296
YOU HEARD HIM.
LET'S THROW THIS
GARBAGE OUT

19:56.329 --> 19:57.464
AND FIRE UP
SOME COW FLESH!

19:57.497 --> 20:01.334
DAD, REALLY, I--
I FEEL BAD EVERYONE'S
DOING THIS FOR ME.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.569
HEY, WE'RE A FAMILY, OK?

20:02.602 --> 20:07.807
SO WHEN SOMEONE WANTS
TO TRY SOMETHING NEW,
WE SUPPORT THEM.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.611
BABY, IS THAT BEAT LOAF?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.580
WOW, DAD.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.

20:13.613 --> 20:18.751
LOOK, I JUST WANT
EVERYONE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE
IN THEIR CHOICES.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.462
WHAT?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.265
NOTHING. I WAS JUST...

20:32.299 --> 20:33.700
I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS
EARLIER,

20:33.733 --> 20:37.470
AND THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
SOMEONE SHOT THE SHERIFF!

20:39.005 --> 20:41.308
YAH, MON!
YOU LOOK IRIE!

20:41.341 --> 20:43.876
ONE LOVE, JIM.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.912
NO, JIMMY, WAIT.
DON'T GO! COME ON!

20:45.945 --> 20:48.515
DON'T, MY LITTLE
BUFFALO SOLDIER!

20:48.548 --> 20:52.552
...ETHIOPIA, MON!
