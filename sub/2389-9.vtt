<i>I can't believe your mom's</i>
<i>not coming to the wedding?</i>

00:03.971 --> 00:05.687
Okay, seriously,
I-I need to stop crying

00:05.689 --> 00:08.039
Does anyone know how
to turn this off?

00:08.042 --> 00:09.591
Is there, like, a button
or something?

00:09.593 --> 00:11.360
Want me to feel
around for it?

00:11.362 --> 00:12.994
It's probably
somewhere on your back.

00:12.996 --> 00:15.397
Stop it.
What? I'm trying to cheer you up.

00:15.399 --> 00:17.282
I don't think that's possible
at this point.

00:17.284 --> 00:18.950
Challenge accepted!

00:18.952 --> 00:20.285
No, Barney,

00:20.287 --> 00:23.588
I just need to get myself
to stop crying, that's all.

00:23.590 --> 00:24.790
Boogity-boo!

00:24.792 --> 00:26.925
Lily, what the hell?!
It's not the hiccups.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.576
I was just going on a hunch.

00:28.578 --> 00:31.213
And now I have the hiccups.

00:43.976 --> 00:45.977
Look, guys, just, seriously,
don't worry about me, okay?

00:45.979 --> 00:47.863
Just let me deal
with this on my own.

00:47.865 --> 00:50.148
I'm afraid that's
not possible, Robin.

00:50.150 --> 00:53.568
Once I've accepted a challenge,
it cannot be unaccepted.

00:53.570 --> 00:57.072
I will not rest
until the job is done.

00:57.074 --> 00:58.373
Oh, is that so?

00:58.375 --> 01:01.910
Then where are our diapers
and Samosas?

01:01.912 --> 01:03.378
Aha!

01:03.380 --> 01:05.881
<i>Diapers and Samosas.</i>
<i>Oh, that's about something</i>

01:05.883 --> 01:09.050
<i>that happened six months</i>
<i>earlier in the fall of 2012.</i>

01:09.052 --> 01:11.553
Major craving for a mojito.

01:11.555 --> 01:12.921
Oh, God, we're back

01:12.923 --> 01:15.507
to your stupid little
private joke again?

01:15.509 --> 01:18.226
Are you guys really still doing
this seven years later?

01:18.228 --> 01:20.679
It's so annoying. Just stop it.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.013
Private joke again?

01:22.015 --> 01:24.182
Are you guys really still
doing this seven years later?

01:24.184 --> 01:25.734
It's so annoying.
Just stop it.

01:25.736 --> 01:27.486
You don't salute a private!

01:27.488 --> 01:29.471
I'll be right back.
All right.

01:29.473 --> 01:31.973
Lily, are you playing
footsie with me?

01:31.975 --> 01:33.191
What?

01:33.193 --> 01:35.777
Oh, no, no. I was just feeling
around for your shin.

01:35.779 --> 01:37.362
My shin? Why would you...?

01:37.364 --> 01:38.947
Ow! Why'd you do that?

01:38.949 --> 01:40.415
To remind you what pain is.

01:40.417 --> 01:43.952
You keep it up with all the
cutesy-tootsy stuff with Robin,

01:43.954 --> 01:47.322
gonna be a whole lot more
where that came from.

01:47.324 --> 01:49.040
Lily, you have nothing
to worry about.

01:49.042 --> 01:51.659
I better not.
You and Robin are platonic.

01:51.661 --> 01:54.662
Please.
Ted and Robin are not platonic.

01:54.664 --> 01:56.765
Just like me and Robin
are not platonic.

01:56.767 --> 02:00.552
Just like no two single people
in the world are ever platonic.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.388
Symposium: two people
are only platonic if

02:03.390 --> 02:04.740
in the next 20 minutes

02:04.765 --> 02:06.912
there is no chance
of them hooking up.

02:07.027 --> 02:11.613
Truth is, I only know of one
genuinely platonic relationship.

02:11.615 --> 02:12.680
You and me.

02:12.682 --> 02:13.782
Don't make me laugh, Lily.

02:13.784 --> 02:15.283
You want to hit this
so hard.

02:15.285 --> 02:19.204
Seriously, she's playing
footsies with me as I... Ow!

02:19.206 --> 02:22.741
No, I'm talking
about Marshall and Robin.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.744
<i>Marshall and Robin wouldn't</i>
<i>hook up even if this happened:</i>

02:25.746 --> 02:27.379
Marshall, Robin!

02:27.381 --> 02:30.215
If you guys don't full-on
make out in the next 20 minutes,

02:30.217 --> 02:32.751
they're gonna blow me up
and everyone in this bar!

02:32.753 --> 02:34.869
My God, no!
Anyone but Robin.

02:34.871 --> 02:36.688
I really don't want
to do this!

02:36.690 --> 02:38.890
Guys, we have no time!
Just do it!

02:46.849 --> 02:49.734
I'm sorry, baby,
I just, I can't do it.

02:49.736 --> 02:50.485
Aw...

02:51.605 --> 02:54.072
And the only survivor
was me

02:54.074 --> 02:56.391
because I was upstairs
banging Ted's mom.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.893
What? Get that blond girl's
phone number?

02:58.895 --> 03:00.278
Challenge accepted.

03:02.833 --> 03:06.201
Unknown caller, stop calling me.

03:06.203 --> 03:07.235
Are you gonna answer it?

03:07.237 --> 03:08.370
Yeah, 'cause it's 1994

03:08.372 --> 03:09.788
and I'm gonna pick up a phone

03:09.790 --> 03:11.289
without knowing who's on
the other end.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.458
I should get going.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.676
Ted...

03:14.678 --> 03:16.344
Lily, by every definition
of the word platonic,

03:16.346 --> 03:18.246
including Barney's fake one,
I can say

03:18.248 --> 03:19.681
with total certainty...

03:19.683 --> 03:20.966
that Brussels sprouts

03:20.968 --> 03:22.917
are the comeback vegetable
of the 21st century.

03:22.919 --> 03:24.085
Well, see you guys later.

03:24.087 --> 03:25.887
Bye.

03:25.889 --> 03:29.391
Challenge completed.

03:29.393 --> 03:32.143
I'm sorry. I-I missed
the first half of this.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.395
Um, why is picking up

03:33.397 --> 03:36.481
a drunk chick sitting alone
and rubbing a tan line

03:36.483 --> 03:39.618
on her finger where a wedding
ring used to be, a challenge?

03:39.620 --> 03:42.504
Because I said
challenge accepted.

03:42.506 --> 03:44.489
See? That's your problem,
Barney.

03:44.491 --> 03:47.492
You only accept challenges
you came up with.

03:47.494 --> 03:50.295
Just once,
I'd like to see you accept

03:50.297 --> 03:51.663
someone else's challenge.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.182
Challenge acc...
Wait-- what's the challenge?

03:54.184 --> 03:58.053
Interesting. An opportunity rife
with possibilities.

03:58.055 --> 03:59.387
We need to find something

03:59.389 --> 04:01.139
with just the right amount
of poetic...

04:01.141 --> 04:04.392
Get a girl's number
while talking like a dolphin!

04:04.394 --> 04:06.294
That works.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:19.108 --> 04:22.142
Open your eyes, ref!
That's not a pregnant lady!

04:22.145 --> 04:24.162
It's a basketball
under his shirt!

04:24.164 --> 04:25.997
Blow the freakin'
whistle!

04:26.866 --> 04:28.617
Anyways, Barney's right;

04:28.619 --> 04:30.652
I would absolutely
let the bar blow up.

04:30.654 --> 04:33.455
But you'd die, and
Lily would die, too.

04:33.457 --> 04:35.957
Yeah, but then we could
haunt the bar for eternity

04:35.959 --> 04:38.009
like we always planned.
Anyways, Robin's your girl.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.878
Why do we keep
coming back to this?

04:39.880 --> 04:42.097
It's fun. Tickets are cheap.
Gets us out of the house.

04:42.099 --> 04:43.598
No, me and Robin.

04:45.384 --> 04:48.520
Because Robin told me that
she's still in love with you.

04:51.698 --> 04:54.113
Are you serious?
Robin told you that she's

04:54.114 --> 04:55.446
still in love with me?

04:55.612 --> 04:56.979
No, I just made that up.

04:56.981 --> 04:59.031
But it was worth it
because I can tell

04:59.033 --> 05:02.017
by that look on your face
that you still have feelings for Robin.

05:02.019 --> 05:04.620
Okay, ball is sitting
on the basket!

05:04.941 --> 05:07.808
That's not only illegal,
it's unsafe!

05:07.810 --> 05:10.094
Come on, Gens, D up!

05:10.096 --> 05:13.247
It's this monastery
in Connecticut out in the woods,

05:13.249 --> 05:16.367
and the nuns there,
they make this gourmet cheese.

05:16.369 --> 05:17.701
It's just amazing.

05:19.372 --> 05:21.655
Wow, was that
three glasses of wine?

05:21.657 --> 05:23.090
Where does the time go

05:25.178 --> 05:27.178
Look, I know
that you need

05:27.180 --> 05:28.662
to get back
to your studies.

05:28.664 --> 05:31.265
Maybe we could get together
some other time?

05:33.986 --> 05:35.102
No! Not possible!

05:35.104 --> 05:36.887
It was the performance
of a lifetime.

05:36.889 --> 05:38.152
Man, if I'd have hung around
for a few more minutes,

05:38.153 --> 05:38.711
I probably could have

05:38.712 --> 05:40.879
gotten her to touch my blowhole.
Give me that.

05:43.896 --> 05:45.563
Hello?

05:45.565 --> 05:47.514
Hi, did you just give
your phone number to a guy

05:47.516 --> 05:48.649
who was squeaking
like a dolphin?

05:48.651 --> 05:50.818
Yeah.

05:50.820 --> 05:51.902
Honey, listen to me.

05:51.904 --> 05:54.155
I need you to take
a year, a full year

05:54.157 --> 05:55.623
and just be
celibate, okay?

05:55.625 --> 05:56.790
No boys.

05:56.792 --> 05:58.209
One year.

05:58.211 --> 06:00.127
I think you know
I'm right about this.

06:00.129 --> 06:01.579
You're right.

06:01.581 --> 06:02.880
Yeah.

06:02.882 --> 06:04.298
That was heartbreaking

06:04.300 --> 06:06.867
And pants-breaking
Boing-oing-oing!

06:06.869 --> 06:08.419
All right, next challenge.

06:08.421 --> 06:10.471
Oh, this is an all-night thing?

06:10.473 --> 06:14.675
Okay, um, pick up a girl...

06:14.677 --> 06:16.227
wearing a garbage bag.

06:16.229 --> 06:19.730
I'd be <i>"Glad"</i> to.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.650
Just hope she's not too <i>"Hefty""</i>

06:22.652 --> 06:26.937
And those are all of the brands
of trash bags I can think of.

06:26.939 --> 06:28.022
I'm not done.

06:28.024 --> 06:32.409
You also can't use
the letter "E."

06:34.746 --> 06:39.083
Challng... accptd-d.

06:40.752 --> 06:42.203
You're single,
she's single,

06:42.205 --> 06:43.504
It's time to do this.

06:43.506 --> 06:45.456
You're only saying this
because you bet Lily

06:45.458 --> 06:47.407
that Robin and I would
end up together,

06:47.409 --> 06:48.909
and you want
that five bucks.

06:48.911 --> 06:50.511
I need that five bucks, Ted.

06:50.513 --> 06:53.264
But more importantly,
I need you to be happy.

06:53.266 --> 06:55.349
Marshall, we're platonic.

06:55.351 --> 06:56.767
But you're not platonic!

06:56.769 --> 06:59.436
You are 20 short minutes away
from happily ever after.

06:59.438 --> 07:02.022
I mean, if you left
right now.

07:06.094 --> 07:07.111
Hey.

07:07.113 --> 07:09.063
I have loved you from
the moment we met.

07:09.065 --> 07:10.430
I know we're meant
to be together.

07:10.432 --> 07:11.899
I don't want to waste
another second without you.

07:11.901 --> 07:12.983
Let's give it
another shot.

07:12.985 --> 07:14.601
Okay!

07:14.603 --> 07:16.603
No!

07:16.605 --> 07:18.739
Pay up, baby.
Pay up.

07:18.741 --> 07:20.440
Oh, yes!

07:20.442 --> 07:23.777
♪ Sweet, sweet five bucks,
you soon will be mine ♪

07:23.779 --> 07:26.247
♪ Even though Lily
and I share bank accounts ♪

07:26.249 --> 07:29.083
♪ You're already mine
to begin with. ♪ Sorry.

07:29.085 --> 07:32.903
And you and Robin get a lifetime
of happiness, so there's that.

07:32.905 --> 07:34.054
But you better hurry up

07:34.056 --> 07:35.455
before some other guy
snatches her up.

07:35.457 --> 07:37.474
Really? And who's
my competition?

07:37.476 --> 07:42.479
Okay, don't use the letter "E."
Don't use the letter "E."

07:43.932 --> 07:44.732
Hey.

07:44.734 --> 07:46.767
Damn it.

07:46.769 --> 07:50.321
Hi. I... am...

07:50.323 --> 07:52.189
Barney. Damn it!

07:52.191 --> 07:53.591
There's an E
in my name!

07:53.593 --> 07:57.578
Hi. My word for...

07:57.580 --> 08:01.198
this guy is Barno.

08:01.916 --> 08:07.371
Barno. You look...

08:07.373 --> 08:09.123
not ugly.

08:10.042 --> 08:12.376
Your... dial thing...

08:12.378 --> 08:13.377
is what?

08:13.379 --> 08:16.180
Do you want
to just go back to my place?

08:16.182 --> 08:18.132
Yes. Damn it!

08:19.050 --> 08:21.552
I want to buy you a drink.

08:21.554 --> 08:26.056
But first, what do I call you?

08:26.058 --> 08:27.691
Elaine Edelstein.

08:29.844 --> 08:33.563
How about I just call you...

08:33.566 --> 08:34.865
tomorrow?

08:34.866 --> 08:38.452
Your digits, m'lady?

08:39.321 --> 08:40.904
Seriously, guys,

08:40.905 --> 08:42.905
you're gonna have
to try harder than that.

08:42.908 --> 08:45.159
Challenge accepted.

08:46.461 --> 08:47.694
Excuse me, hi.

08:47.696 --> 08:50.130
I'm Ryan Gosling's
personal assistant.

08:50.132 --> 08:52.416
He saw you
as you were walking in,

08:52.418 --> 08:55.753
and he sent me over
to tell you to wait here.

08:55.755 --> 08:57.254
Be cool. This is real, okay?

08:57.256 --> 09:00.758
But listen, Ryan is super shy.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.976
Aw...
I know.

09:02.978 --> 09:05.879
Which means that if he comes in
here and he sees you talking

09:05.881 --> 09:08.849
to some other guy, he's gonna
turn right around and leave.

09:09.818 --> 09:11.352
Nod if you understand.

09:12.103 --> 09:13.270
Redhead at the bar.

09:13.272 --> 09:14.688
Challenge accepted.

09:15.740 --> 09:18.342
Hey, there.
Get away from me!

09:18.344 --> 09:20.727
It's like you're trying
to lose, Eddie!

09:20.729 --> 09:22.112
Hey, Eddie,
last time I saw

09:22.114 --> 09:24.114
this many turnovers
was at a bakery. - Oh!

09:25.166 --> 09:26.867
So are you doing this or what?
No.

09:26.869 --> 09:29.002
And for the record,
if I were gonna do it,

09:29.004 --> 09:32.089
I wouldn't just be, like,
"Hey, we should get back together".

09:32.091 --> 09:33.257
Amateur hour.

09:33.259 --> 09:35.292
Here's how you do it.

09:37.412 --> 09:40.097
Excuse me. Okay, sorry.

09:40.882 --> 09:42.466
Sorry.

09:43.518 --> 09:44.535
Huh.

09:47.755 --> 09:50.391
Stop, thief!

09:53.611 --> 09:56.230
<i>The blue French horn,</i>
<i>it's so romantic!</i>

09:56.232 --> 09:58.515
Oh, my God, do you know
who you are?!

09:58.517 --> 10:00.367
You're Nicholas Sparks!

10:00.369 --> 10:03.437
Hey, everybody, we got
a, uh, celebrity

10:03.439 --> 10:06.457
in the crowd over here.
We got, uh, Nicholas Sparks!

10:06.459 --> 10:08.125
You didn't let me finish.

10:08.127 --> 10:10.210
Ted, listen...

10:11.397 --> 10:13.380
I can do without reliving that.

10:13.382 --> 10:15.582
Are you completely blind?

10:15.584 --> 10:16.383
What?

10:16.385 --> 10:18.135
Open your eyes, ref!

10:18.137 --> 10:20.804
The ball hasn't touched
the ground in seven minutes!

10:20.806 --> 10:22.339
Hey, ref, check
your voicemail!

10:22.341 --> 10:24.341
I think you've missed
a few calls!

10:26.345 --> 10:29.796
Are you completely blind?!

10:29.798 --> 10:30.931
Wait-- me or...?

10:30.933 --> 10:32.483
You, Ted!

10:32.485 --> 10:33.851
Robin has changed her mind.

10:33.853 --> 10:35.686
No, Robin doesn't change
her mind.

10:35.688 --> 10:37.104
Except that she does.

10:37.106 --> 10:39.940
Remember how she used to claim
to hate white guy funk bands?

10:39.942 --> 10:42.025
And yet, at the farewell
performance of my band,

10:42.027 --> 10:44.778
"The Funk, the Whole Funk
and Nothing but the Funk,"

10:44.780 --> 10:46.747
there's Robin
rhythmically nodding her head

10:46.749 --> 10:49.333
and shouting out a request
for "Give Up the Funk."

10:49.335 --> 10:52.486
I think she was nodding her head
in response to my question,

10:52.488 --> 10:54.821
"Do you want
to leave soon?"

10:54.823 --> 10:56.457
And she was
legitimately suggesting

10:56.459 --> 10:58.091
that you give up the funk.

10:59.594 --> 11:01.661
Can we just drop this?
I have moved on.

11:01.663 --> 11:03.213
Well, except that you haven't.

11:03.215 --> 11:05.716
You didn't just come up with
this blue French horn thing.

11:05.718 --> 11:07.050
You've thought about this.

11:07.052 --> 11:08.352
Mr. Sparks?

11:08.354 --> 11:09.887
I loved <i>The Notebook.</i>

11:09.889 --> 11:12.756
Eddie, you're down by 80.

11:12.758 --> 11:14.808
Will you watch the ge?

11:16.611 --> 11:17.895
Do not come any closer!

11:17.897 --> 11:19.062
I swear to God I will kill you.

11:19.064 --> 11:21.782
It's cool.
I'm not gonna come any closer.

11:21.784 --> 11:24.535
You're looking at the door,
you're waiting for someone.

11:24.537 --> 11:26.820
Someone important,
someone who will fill

11:26.822 --> 11:28.555
an empty space in your life.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.741
A movie star?

11:30.743 --> 11:31.992
Ah-huh.

11:31.994 --> 11:34.361
But which one?

11:34.363 --> 11:35.963
Clooney,

11:35.965 --> 11:39.383
DiCaprio, Zabka...?

11:39.385 --> 11:41.235
No...

11:41.237 --> 11:43.754
I'm gonna go with Ryan...

11:43.756 --> 11:46.323
Reyn...

11:46.325 --> 11:47.591
Phil-Phillip...

11:47.593 --> 11:50.294
Seacr... Gosling...

11:50.296 --> 11:52.062
Ryan Gosling!

11:52.064 --> 11:53.647
Yes, I'm waiting
for Ryan Gosling, okay?

11:53.649 --> 11:55.816
Now, leave me alone.

12:01.239 --> 12:03.440
You passed my test, girl.

12:06.077 --> 12:08.278
- Ryan?
<i>- No.</i>

12:08.280 --> 12:10.614
Just... no.

12:10.616 --> 12:11.915
I told her I'm a method actor.

12:11.917 --> 12:13.567
And I had to get plastic surgery

12:13.569 --> 12:15.536
for an upcoming role
where I play a man

12:15.538 --> 12:17.404
much more handsome than myself.

12:17.406 --> 12:19.673
Congratulations, you win.

12:19.675 --> 12:21.074
Win? No, I don't want to win.

12:21.076 --> 12:23.460
I want to keep playing.
More challenges.

12:23.462 --> 12:24.711
Fine, you want
another challenge?

12:24.713 --> 12:26.847
More challenges,
more challenges.

12:26.849 --> 12:27.931
Fine, here's your challenge.

12:27.933 --> 12:30.584
Go down to the pharmacy
and buy some diapers.

12:30.586 --> 12:33.637
And, uh, get me a Samosa
from the Indian place.

12:33.639 --> 12:35.639
Sounds like an errand.

12:35.641 --> 12:37.724
While picking up a girl.

12:37.726 --> 12:40.310
Challenge accepted!

12:40.312 --> 12:41.478
Come on!

12:41.480 --> 12:42.496
Whatever happened to the guy

12:42.498 --> 12:43.530
who wasn't afraid to charge

12:43.532 --> 12:44.948
headlong into the unknown?

12:44.950 --> 12:46.617
What unknown?

12:46.619 --> 12:47.767
Sure, eight years ago

12:47.769 --> 12:49.319
when I stole
that blue French horn, yeah.

12:49.321 --> 12:50.770
That was the unknown.

12:50.772 --> 12:52.990
But now? I mean, how many times
have we been here?

12:52.992 --> 12:55.075
I know exactly
what's gonna happen.

12:55.077 --> 12:57.777
You know who else knew exactly
what was gonna happen, Ted?

12:57.779 --> 13:00.714
The Washington Generals
on January 5, 1971.

13:00.716 --> 13:03.166
They knew they were gonna lose,
but they went in there anyway,

13:03.168 --> 13:04.668
and then gave it
their best shot.

13:04.670 --> 13:06.453
And they won that game, Ted!

13:06.455 --> 13:08.422
For one reason
and for one reason only.

13:08.424 --> 13:10.957
A scoring error and the fact
that Curly Neal had the flu?

13:10.959 --> 13:12.976
Perseverance.

13:12.978 --> 13:15.062
It was the only win
in Generals history,

13:15.064 --> 13:16.763
but that's all <i>you</i> need.

13:16.765 --> 13:18.148
Just one win.

13:19.151 --> 13:22.486
I'm gonna go
grab us some beers.

13:24.490 --> 13:27.307
Hi, I don't know who this is
or what you're trying to sell,

13:27.309 --> 13:29.976
but you are disturbing me
during the Globetrotters.

13:29.978 --> 13:33.947
Hello, Ted,
it's Hammond Druthers.

13:37.185 --> 13:39.419
Target acquired.

13:48.181 --> 13:50.598
I'm recruiting volunteers

13:50.599 --> 13:52.349
for the starving puppy orphanage
where I work.

13:52.351 --> 13:53.683
For free.

13:53.685 --> 13:57.454
So, if you wouldn't mind just
writing your number down

13:57.456 --> 14:00.240
on this signup sheet...?

14:00.242 --> 14:03.794
Listen, I appreciate
that you feel

14:03.796 --> 14:05.195
like you need my number.

14:05.197 --> 14:06.363
Um.

14:06.365 --> 14:08.549
Maybe it's because
you're really sad

14:08.551 --> 14:10.250
about something
and this is your way

14:10.252 --> 14:11.919
of feeling better
about yourself.

14:11.921 --> 14:13.203
But...

14:13.205 --> 14:15.823
since I have a boyfriend,
and I'm pretty sure

14:15.825 --> 14:18.592
I heard you call me a target
earlier over there,

14:18.594 --> 14:20.060
Wha...?
I'm gonna go ahead

14:20.062 --> 14:21.261
and not give you my number.

14:21.263 --> 14:23.530
I'm gonna give you
something even better.

14:23.532 --> 14:25.215
Wow, right to the chase.

14:25.217 --> 14:26.567
Meet you in aisle six.

14:26.569 --> 14:29.436
I'm gonna give you this.
Okay.

14:29.438 --> 14:31.188
It's gonna be okay.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.440
You're a good guy.

14:33.442 --> 14:35.725
You will get through this.

14:38.896 --> 14:40.280
Uh, okay.

14:40.282 --> 14:42.065
Weirdo alert.

14:45.904 --> 14:48.071
Have you met...?

14:49.525 --> 14:50.958
Excuse me.

14:54.212 --> 14:56.046
What do you mean "sad"?

14:56.048 --> 14:57.514
<i>Ted?</i>

14:57.516 --> 14:59.383
I'm calling you
from Chicago, Illinois

14:59.385 --> 15:00.968
where I'm a key player

15:00.970 --> 15:03.470
in a very successful
architectural firm.

15:03.472 --> 15:04.754
Oh, yeah, I read about that.

15:04.756 --> 15:06.089
All right,
about what you read...

15:06.091 --> 15:08.058
You built
that big concave glass tower.

15:08.060 --> 15:10.227
And it melted a few buildings
across the street.

15:10.229 --> 15:12.312
Yes, fine, but come on.

15:12.314 --> 15:14.698
What architect has made
a major design flaw

15:14.700 --> 15:16.784
that raised the temperature
of the city aquarium

15:16.786 --> 15:17.818
to 190 degrees

15:17.820 --> 15:20.103
and killed thousands
of very rare fish?

15:20.105 --> 15:23.106
That's the past, Ted.
I'm looking forward.

15:23.108 --> 15:25.209
I want you on my team.

15:25.211 --> 15:27.244
And I won't take no
for an answer.

15:27.246 --> 15:30.113
No.
I don't think you heard me, Ted.

15:30.115 --> 15:32.382
No.
Come on, Ted!

15:32.384 --> 15:33.667
Please?

15:33.669 --> 15:36.003
They're gonna give me
a parking spot if you say yes.

15:36.005 --> 15:38.255
Do I get a parking spot?
Well, we can go tandem.

15:38.257 --> 15:39.789
No.
Every other week then?

15:39.791 --> 15:40.341
No.

15:40.366 --> 15:42.366
You know, Chicago's
more of a walking town.

15:42.511 --> 15:44.144
No.
All right!

15:44.146 --> 15:46.146
You can have the parking spot.

15:46.148 --> 15:47.231
So, that's a yes?

15:47.233 --> 15:49.399
Mm, no.
Look, Ted.

15:49.401 --> 15:52.853
I can make your life
very difficult.

15:52.855 --> 15:55.606
How?
How?!

15:56.741 --> 15:59.776
I will call you a lot.

15:59.778 --> 16:01.829
I will Tweet at you like crazy.

16:01.831 --> 16:05.332
I will live
on your Facebook wall!

16:05.334 --> 16:06.366
We're not Facebook friends.

16:06.368 --> 16:07.751
Yeah, what's going on with that?

16:07.753 --> 16:10.504
It's been pending, like,
for eight months now.

16:10.506 --> 16:13.257
Look, Ted, you're a...

16:13.259 --> 16:15.959
a very hot commodity.

16:15.961 --> 16:19.630
Everybody loves the GNB Tower.

16:19.632 --> 16:21.548
And how it hasn't blinded
any pilots

16:21.550 --> 16:23.667
on final approach into O'Hare.

16:24.553 --> 16:26.136
And I-I may have told

16:26.138 --> 16:27.804
the partners here
that you and I are

16:27.806 --> 16:29.022
very, very good friends.

16:29.024 --> 16:31.608
So, please, just say
that you'll think about it.

16:31.610 --> 16:32.809
Fine.

16:32.811 --> 16:34.695
I'll think about it.

16:34.697 --> 16:36.980
Druthers shoots, he scores!

16:36.982 --> 16:40.850
Sad? Lady, I got 14 girls'
numbers in the last hour.

16:40.852 --> 16:43.036
And this was an off night.

16:43.038 --> 16:45.322
What can I possibly
be sad about?

16:45.324 --> 16:48.041
I think you were in love
and you messed it up.

16:49.527 --> 16:51.044
And every moment of your life
since then

16:51.046 --> 16:54.198
has been spent trying to stay
busy enough to ignore that fact.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.167
<i>And that's how Barney met</i>
<i>your mother.</i>

17:00.004 --> 17:02.005
Well, the Generals lost.

17:02.007 --> 17:03.423
What a nail biter--
the whole fourth quarter

17:03.425 --> 17:04.892
my heart was in my throat.

17:04.894 --> 17:06.059
What was the final?

17:06.060 --> 17:07.261
216 to 12.

17:07.262 --> 17:08.983
Nobody talk to me right
now, I can't even...

17:11.182 --> 17:12.683
The strangest thing
happened at the game.

17:12.685 --> 17:14.651
I got a phone call
from an unknown number.

17:14.653 --> 17:16.435
And when I answered I...

17:17.238 --> 17:18.271
You're eating olives.

17:18.273 --> 17:19.740
Yup.

17:19.742 --> 17:20.741
Do you want these?

17:20.742 --> 17:22.224
I hate olives.

17:22.227 --> 17:23.859
I... thought you hate olives.

17:23.862 --> 17:26.496
I guess I changed my mind.

17:28.701 --> 17:29.833
Ah!

17:29.835 --> 17:31.335
Hello, partner!

17:31.337 --> 17:34.254
Boy, that just sounds right,
doesn't it?

17:34.256 --> 17:36.673
Yeah, actually, Mr. Druthers.

17:36.675 --> 17:38.408
My answer is no.

17:38.410 --> 17:41.261
What? No, Ted, come on!

17:41.263 --> 17:45.015
I'm sorry, I still have things
to do here in New York.

17:45.017 --> 17:47.083
I am going to build
a tower of glass

17:47.085 --> 17:49.353
and melt you with it!

17:49.355 --> 17:52.088
No, you won't.
No, I won't, but know this.

17:52.090 --> 17:53.607
After today

17:53.609 --> 17:55.192
this offer

17:55.194 --> 17:56.476
is gone forever.

17:56.478 --> 17:59.396
When I hang up this phone,
you and I are done.

17:59.398 --> 18:02.265
The door is closed!
Okay.

18:02.267 --> 18:03.400
The door's always open, Ted.

18:03.402 --> 18:04.934
If you change your mind,
just call me back, okay?

18:04.936 --> 18:06.987
Bye.

18:06.989 --> 18:10.273
I think he's coming around.

18:10.275 --> 18:11.875
We tried dating a while back

18:11.877 --> 18:13.977
and it was a disaster.

18:13.979 --> 18:16.413
But I-I always regret giving up.

18:16.415 --> 18:18.665
It just ended so quickly.

18:19.752 --> 18:22.019
What about you?

18:22.021 --> 18:24.388
You and your boyfriend
gonna go the distance?

18:24.390 --> 18:25.955
I don't know.

18:25.957 --> 18:29.142
I think maybe I still
haven't met the right guy.

18:29.144 --> 18:31.294
Hmm.

18:31.296 --> 18:33.764
I wonder if I know someone
to set you up with.

18:36.968 --> 18:39.770
Drawing a blank.

18:39.772 --> 18:41.471
Are you gonna
go get this girl?

18:41.473 --> 18:42.522
Or what?

18:42.524 --> 18:43.807
I don't know.

18:43.809 --> 18:45.776
I'm kind of
at my peak right now.

18:45.778 --> 18:48.645
I don't know if I can
just walk away from the game.

18:48.647 --> 18:52.499
Do you want to keep playing
or do you want to win?

18:54.585 --> 18:57.320
I want to win.

18:58.155 --> 19:00.323
What am I doing?

19:00.325 --> 19:02.459
In less than 20 minutes,
Robin and I could be...

19:02.461 --> 19:03.677
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
