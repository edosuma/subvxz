11:39.132 --> 11:42.269
I got an appointment with a guy
who likes to suck on my feet.

11:42.302 --> 11:45.138
First car to pass
the blue mailbox wins!
Let's do this!

11:45.172 --> 11:47.407
Whoo, Jackie!

11:47.440 --> 11:49.843
Whoo! Who's Jackie?

11:49.877 --> 11:51.979
[ Shouts ]

11:55.015 --> 11:57.350
[ Cheering ]

12:03.556 --> 12:06.927
[ Earl Narrating ]
We were neck and neck until we
got both cars up to about 30.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.196
[ Engines Sputter ]
Then they quit on us.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.932
Oh!

12:13.967 --> 12:16.536
[ Backfires ]

12:16.569 --> 12:20.007
Ed! Get up here
and push!

12:20.040 --> 12:23.844
- Go, Ed! go!
- Randy, come on and push!
Come on!

12:25.345 --> 12:27.781
Go, Ed!
[ Earl ] So the race
turned out to be...

12:27.815 --> 12:30.550
less about horsepower
and more about brother power.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.553
- Come on, Randy!
You can do it!
- Come on, Ed!

12:33.586 --> 12:37.257
- Push!
- [ Coughing ]

12:37.290 --> 12:39.226
You got it, Randy!
We're almost there!

12:39.259 --> 12:41.494
[ Coughing Continues ]

12:44.397 --> 12:46.867
- I told you to give up
those cigarettes, Ed!
- [ Coughing Continues ]

12:49.336 --> 12:51.872
- [ Cheering ]
- [ Earl Narrating ]
And I had more brother power.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.341
We did it, Randy!
[ Panting ]

12:54.374 --> 12:57.077
Yeah, Randy!

12:57.110 --> 12:59.847
I won, Billy!
The car is mine.

12:59.880 --> 13:04.151
Fine. You get the car.
But it was a close race.
I still got my dignity.

13:04.184 --> 13:08.956
Hey, Billy! Is it okay
if I cancel your appointment
to suck my feet?

13:08.989 --> 13:11.124
I'm just not
feelin' it anymore.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.531
[ Earl Narrating ] After over
20 years of lyin' to my dad
about what happened to his car,

13:18.565 --> 13:21.068
it was time
to tell him the truth.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.141
It's not Mother's Day
anymore, Earl.
Come back next year.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.444
No, w-w-wait, Dad.
I'm here for you. Look.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.214
I didn't lose your car
in a lake.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.583
I lost it in a race,
but I just won it back.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.585
Now I can cross you off
my list like Mom wanted.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.354
- My car?
- Yeah, your Mustang.

13:41.388 --> 13:45.158
Idiot, that car wasn't for me.
That was going to be your car
when you turned 16.

13:45.192 --> 13:48.028
- What?
- Yep.

13:48.061 --> 13:51.364
So I guess I'm not the one
who should be on that list.

13:51.398 --> 13:55.302
"Lost my own car
because I'm an idiot."

14:02.509 --> 14:06.146
I can't believe
I lost my own car.

14:06.179 --> 14:10.550
Hey, look at this one,
number 67--
ran over Crackers.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.420
Hey, what kind of crackers
did you run over, saltines?

14:13.453 --> 14:15.388
I bet it made
a crunchy sound.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.296
[ Earl Narrating ]
Findin' out the car I lost
was supposed to be for me...

14:23.330 --> 14:25.632
put me in a situation
I'd never faced before.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.435
I'm on my own list.
What the hell am I
supposed to do about this?

14:28.468 --> 14:31.038
Can't you just forgive yourself
and cross it off?

14:31.071 --> 14:35.642
I don't want to forgive myself.
My life would've been a lot
better if I had that Mustang.

14:35.675 --> 14:38.111
I wouldn't have lost
my virginity in a public bus.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.613
And I wouldn't have
had to watch.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.550
[ Slurred ]
Hey, dummies.

14:43.583 --> 14:48.621
What, are you guys-- Probably
sittin' here sayin' stupid
stuff? Doin' stupid stuff?

14:48.655 --> 14:51.491
[ Laughing ]

14:56.196 --> 14:58.231
I'm gonna fix up that car.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.233
Really?
Yeah.
Why shouldn't I?

15:00.267 --> 15:02.602
Everybody else on the list
makes me do somethin' for them.

15:02.635 --> 15:06.306
Why should I be any different?
I'm gonna pay myself back.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.275
Come on, Randy.

15:11.344 --> 15:16.016
Hey. Hold on.
I'm gonna come too.
Hold on.

15:19.186 --> 15:22.522
Maybe you should
drive her home.
I don't know. She might be okay.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.095
Damn it. Who threw
their drink at me?

15:28.128 --> 15:30.663
I'll drive her home.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.500
[ Earl Narrating ]
So while Randy
got Joy home safe,

15:33.533 --> 15:37.270
I went to my parents' house
to fix up the car that should've
been mine 20 years ago.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.074
What the hell are you doing?

15:41.108 --> 15:43.443
Mom said I could
fix the car here.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.413
I can't work on a car
at the motel.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.016
Every time you slide under,
somebody tries to steal
your shoes.

15:49.049 --> 15:52.319
- I told you
I don't want the car.
- I'm not doin' this for you.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.588
I-I-I lost myself a car.
I owe myself a car.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.458
- I'm doin' this for me.
- Yeah, well, fixin' a car
is a lot of work.

15:58.491 --> 16:01.594
So let me know when you give up,
and I'll call the junkyard.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.265
[ Earl Narrating ]
It was gonna be hard work.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.968
But this was the list,
so quittin' wasn't an option.

16:10.203 --> 16:13.406
See? I told you.
I drove just fine.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.643
Oh, I drove. You were
steering with a paper plate
in the passenger seat,

16:16.676 --> 16:19.179
but you did get
a couple of the turns right.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.684
Randy, do you wanna
spend the night tonight?

16:24.717 --> 16:27.220
[ Earl Narrating ]
It was an odd request.

16:27.254 --> 16:30.257
Randy had never thought
of Joy in that way.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.559
I'm lonely, Randy.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.727
I don't think I can
go a whole week.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.732
[ Earl Narrating ]
So that night,
Randy gave her what she needed.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.035
[ Banging ]

16:42.069 --> 16:44.304
And much to Randy's surprise,

16:44.337 --> 16:48.375
the next morning
when Joy was sober,
she was hungry for more.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.343
So much more that
they didn't even notice...

16:50.377 --> 16:52.245
when Darnell and the kids
came home early.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.181
Joy?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.584
Hey, boys!
Welcome home!

16:57.617 --> 17:00.753
Cool. A sheet fort.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.056
- [ Together ]
Cool!
- Come get in!

17:03.090 --> 17:07.227
[ Earl Narrating ]
You see, what Joy couldn't go
a week without was her kids.

17:07.260 --> 17:11.464
Randy playing with that toy
plane made her realize how much
she missed bein' a mom.

17:14.467 --> 17:18.271
How much she missed
someone innocent around
to liven up the house.

17:23.576 --> 17:27.080
Someone who needed her
to take care of him.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.382
Someone to have fun with.

17:29.416 --> 17:33.586
Because no matter how far
she sent her boys away,
she was still a mom.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.523
There was no forgettin' it.
And she didn't want to.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.594
And the next morning,
I was still making headway
on the Mustang.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.830
At least I thought I was.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.304
You're putting
a 1970 carburetor
on a '65?

17:51.338 --> 17:53.340
It'll fit.
Oh, sure, it'll fit.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.176
That size four dress'll fit
your mother, but I wouldn't
take her out in it.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.877
That's a matching numbers
car there.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.281
Well, it's gonna have to work
'cause it's all I have.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.362
Where is this from?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.730
1965.
Just put it on there.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.869
Go on.

18:22.902 --> 18:26.139
That's it.
That's it. Easy.

18:26.173 --> 18:30.643
No, no, no, no.
You gotta hold it down even
so you don't cross the threads.

18:30.677 --> 18:36.316
Go to the cabinet,
get the throttle plate.
We're gonna need that next.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.218
Go. You know what
a throttle plate looks like,
don't you?

18:38.251 --> 18:40.920
[ Grunts ]

18:40.953 --> 18:45.625
[ Earl Narrating ] When I saw
all those Mustang parts my
father bought over 20 years ago,

18:45.658 --> 18:49.296
I realized this wasn't
just a car my dad
had planned on givin' me.

18:49.329 --> 18:52.199
It was a car he had planned on
us rebuildin' together.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.133
[ Ratchet Clicking ]

18:56.236 --> 18:58.371
So that's what we did.

18:58.405 --> 19:01.641
Over the next couple days,
we got talkin' less
about car parts...

19:01.674 --> 19:04.744
and more about other things.
So I was supposed
to be named Carl?

19:04.777 --> 19:07.214
Yep, after me.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.382
But on your birth certificate--

19:09.416 --> 19:12.452
I've always sucked at cursive,
so I put an extra loop
on the "C."

19:12.485 --> 19:16.556
So the "C" looked like an "E,"
and here you are-- Earl Hickey.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.659
[ Earl Narrating ]
And before I knew it, I was
havin' somethin' with my dad...

19:19.692 --> 19:22.295
I never had before--
a conversation.

19:22.329 --> 19:25.898
And we kept on havin' 'em
for the next two weeks,
until the car was finished.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.638
Looks great, huh?
It sure does.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.740
[ Earl Narrating ]
And then it came to me.

19:33.773 --> 19:37.744
What I had cheated myself
out of, all those years ago,
wasn't a car.

19:37.777 --> 19:41.214
It was a chance
to have some quality time
with my dad.

19:41.248 --> 19:44.784
And now that I got that,
I could cross myself
off my list.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.388
[ Sighs ]

19:56.263 --> 19:57.930
Well, here you go.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.902
Now, the paint's
not totally dry,

20:02.935 --> 20:05.472
so don't let Randy
slide across the hood
like he always wants to.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.776
Hmm.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.811
Maybe I should
just keep it here.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.914
Here? Why would you
want to do that?

20:14.947 --> 20:18.885
Well, the motel's no place
to store a nice car like this.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.554
Plus, you'd get
to drive it too.

20:28.495 --> 20:31.030
Let's go take her
for a ride.
Mm-hmm.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.833
[ Earl Narrating ]
Some people might think...

20:33.866 --> 20:36.836
that leavin' that car
with my dad
was an unselfish act.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.272
But I wasn't doin' it
for him.

20:39.306 --> 20:42.375
That car was
the first good memory
my dad and I had together,

20:42.409 --> 20:44.477
and I didn't want him
to forget it.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.323
[ Sighs ]

20:56.356 --> 20:58.791
What the hell?

20:58.825 --> 21:01.694
Somebody put a damn
snake-dog back here!
[ Ferret Chittering ]

21:01.728 --> 21:03.730
Don't touch
the ferret, Patty!
[ Shouting ]

21:03.763 --> 21:05.865
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Patty, don't touch
the ferret!
