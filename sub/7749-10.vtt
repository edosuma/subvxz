00:30.190 --> 00:32.329
*

00:40.200 --> 00:41.792
(toilet flushes)

00:41.840 --> 00:43.307
No, no.

00:43.340 --> 00:44.307
D-Don't put me on hold.

00:45.340 --> 00:48.309
(hold music plays)

00:51.450 --> 00:53.509
Ugh.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.519
Oh, come on!

01:00.190 --> 01:02.226
Aah.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.228
Gosh.
REPRESENTATIVE: Hello,
this is Ticket Hunt.

01:04.260 --> 01:05.227
How may I help you?

01:05.260 --> 01:06.227
Oh, oh, yes, yes.

01:06.260 --> 01:07.454
Good, good, a live person.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.422
Yes, I-I need two tickets

01:09.470 --> 01:11.426
for the Neil Diamond
concert tonight.

01:11.470 --> 01:13.665
I...
Okay, let me check availability.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.429
No, no. D-Don't put me on hold.

01:15.470 --> 01:17.438
It's for my wife
and my anniversary tonight.

01:17.470 --> 01:19.438
It's for t... t...
(holding music plays)

01:19.480 --> 01:21.471
Oh, God.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.674
Ugh!

01:26.280 --> 01:27.645
What's this?

01:27.680 --> 01:28.840
Where's carrot?

01:28.880 --> 01:30.211
WOMAN: They didn't
have carrot,

01:30.250 --> 01:31.444
they just had
banana walnut.

01:31.490 --> 01:33.287
I don't like banana walnut.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.550
You're needed in
court, Your Honor.

01:35.590 --> 01:36.784
(phone beeps off)

01:38.790 --> 01:40.792
MAN:
All rise.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.358
Okay, everybody sit.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.389
Your Honor,
I would like...

01:45.430 --> 01:47.830
No. M_s. Pine-- what are
you domg on your phone?

01:47.870 --> 01:51.829
If I can't be on my phone, you
can't be on your phone either.

01:51.870 --> 01:54.407
This is... this is not carrot.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.374
This... this is berry
of some kind.

01:56.410 --> 01:58.708
Oh, Mrs. Florrick,
how are you this morning?

01:58.750 --> 02:01.241
Showing your support?

02:01.280 --> 02:04.147
Hello, Your Honor.
I'm surprised that
you made time for us.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.681
You know, running for
state's attorney and everything.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.359
Aanay, everybody in my
chambers for a 402.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.426
You, you, you and you.

02:11.460 --> 02:12.529
Let's go.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.528
I don't think
I'm much help here.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.528
We'll call if
we need you.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.696
Cary.

02:17.730 --> 02:19.368
It's odd to be
on this side.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.697
I know.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.432
So, where are we at?

02:25.470 --> 02:26.698
Because I really
don't want to be

02:26.740 --> 02:28.469
in _that courtroom
With you people.

02:28.510 --> 02:30.478
If Mr. Agos pleads guilty
we're offering ten years.

02:30.510 --> 02:33.217
We're not taking
ten years.
Well, you have
a loser case, Diane.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.548
If you think that, Your Honor,
you should recuse yourself.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.389
No, no. This is off the record,
right, Judy?

02:37.420 --> 02:40.787
Now, when Judy types,
history takes notice.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.186
Otherwise, I strong-arm
both of you,

02:43.230 --> 02:44.788
and we compromise
somewhere in the middle.

02:44.830 --> 02:46.229
That's a 402.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.852
I did nothing wrong,
Your Honor.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.892
You're in my court, young man,
that means you did something.

02:50.930 --> 02:52.739
They're
railroading me.

02:52.770 --> 02:53.930
There is a wire
that I will allow into evidence

02:53.970 --> 02:55.961
that has you,
Mr. Agos,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.537
advising drug dealers
how to avoid arrest.

02:58.570 --> 02:59.969
DIANE: Your Honor, that cannot
be allowed into evidence.

03:00.010 --> 03:01.898
It is hearsay.

03:01.940 --> 03:04.204
Yeah, and she will argue
"forfeiture by wrongdoing."

03:04.250 --> 03:07.276
And I will_ove_rrule
your objection,

03:07.320 --> 03:08.719
because she is right
on the law.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.217
And you know that
and I know that.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.547
So, take the plea.

03:11.590 --> 03:12.386
No.

03:12.420 --> 03:15.457
(sighs)

03:15.490 --> 03:17.583
All right then, Ms. Pine.

03:17.630 --> 03:18.927
Sweeten the deal.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.919
Come on, I'm not
your friend here.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.494
Six years, that's the best...

03:24.530 --> 03:26.430
There we go.

03:26.470 --> 03:27.835
Diane, Mr. Agos,

03:27.870 --> 03:30.009
this is called
compromise.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.302
Six years,

03:31.340 --> 03:32.978
with day-to-day
good time,

03:33.010 --> 03:35.934
that means_
three years In prison.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.641
What do you say?

03:37.680 --> 03:39.272
I say no.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.947
It's three years
of your life, Cary.

03:40.980 --> 03:42.743
You'll be a felon.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.348
You won't be able
to practice law.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.641
DIANE: Yes, but
like Will said...

03:45.690 --> 03:47.749
"Juries are
a Jump ball."

03:47.790 --> 03:49.326
Judge could be
in a bad mood,

03:49.360 --> 03:51.954
a witness could fall apart,
a juror change his mind.

03:51.990 --> 03:52.957
I mean, they're
unpredictable.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.956
I can't go to jail again.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.968
I was there a week,
I can't even imagine...

03:57.000 --> 03:58.763
DIANE: Yes,
but 15 years?

03:58.800 --> 04:00.336
If you're
convicted...

04:02.740 --> 04:05.664
Ask Polmar.
Ask him what?

04:05.710 --> 04:07.439
Ask him whether their bottom
line is really three years.

04:09.310 --> 04:10.675
So...

04:10.710 --> 04:13.474
do you need a lavwer?

04:15.320 --> 04:17.686
We're plea bargaining
with Geneva Pine.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.039
They offered Cary
three years.

04:19.090 --> 04:21.513
We're wondering what
the SA's bottom line is.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.552
Well, you know that it would be
unethical for me to answer that.

04:24.590 --> 04:26.592
(phone rings)

04:28.100 --> 04:30.068
Sorry, would you excuse me?

04:30.100 --> 04:31.897
Hello.

04:31.930 --> 04:33.739
JACKIE:
Hello, Alicia, it's Jackie.

04:33.770 --> 04:34.737
Uh, yes.

04:34.770 --> 04:36.067
Jackie, I'm at work.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.328
Can we talk later?

04:37.370 --> 04:38.598
No, unfortunately, we can't.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.403
I'm at Grace's school.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.634
What's wrong? What happened?

04:41.680 --> 04:43.341
Oh, nothing, um...

04:43.380 --> 04:44.608
They couldn't get hold of you,

04:44.650 --> 04:46.618
and my name is still
on the contact list...

04:46.650 --> 04:47.947
Is Grace all right?

04:47.980 --> 04:49.049
Oh, yes, yes.
No, everything's good.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.479
But I think you'd better
come down here.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.487
Why?

04:51.520 --> 04:53.715
Alicia, did you threaten

04:53.760 --> 04:56.320
to kill a teacher with a knife?

04:57.960 --> 04:59.655
REPRESENTATIVE:
You're in luck, Mr. Kernal.
Cuesta.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.622
I-I'm sorry, sir. I've located

05:01.660 --> 05:03.389
two tickets
for Neil Diamond at the

05:03.430 --> 05:05.091
Chicago State University
location.
Oh, good,

05:05.130 --> 05:07.360
good. Can you
reserve them for me?

05:07.400 --> 05:09.664
Unfortunately, sir,
those tickets will require

05:09.710 --> 05:11.666
your physical presence
at the university location.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.029
And that office closes at 5:30.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.809
WOMAN: You're needed
in court, Your Honor.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.547
Uh, hold onto them for me.
I'll be there.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.411
SHERIFF:
All rise. Court is in session.

05:21.450 --> 05:23.384
Everybody sit.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.547
Ms. Lockhart, where
are we on the plea?

05:25.590 --> 05:28.582
We reject the proposed
plea offer, Your Honor.
You're not helping

05:28.620 --> 05:29.826
my day, Ms. Lockhart.
My apologies,

05:29.860 --> 05:31.555
Your Honor.
So...

05:31.590 --> 05:33.399
we will continue with voir dire,

05:33.430 --> 05:36.399
but I want you to know
this jury will be seated today.

05:36.430 --> 05:38.398
Let's go. Bring 'em in.

05:38.430 --> 05:40.591
(school bell ringing)

05:49.480 --> 05:53.041
Mrs. Florrick, good.
Maybe you can help us with this?

05:53.080 --> 05:55.116
Hey, Mom.
Grace.

05:55.150 --> 05:57.118
"Dear Coach Linklater,

05:57.150 --> 06:00.381
"As I wrote yesterday, Grace
needs to be excused from running

06:00.420 --> 06:03.150
"in PE. because she's
contracted a cold.

06:03.190 --> 06:05.158
"If you make her
run again,

06:05.190 --> 06:07.658
"I will personally come
down to your office

06:07.700 --> 06:11.124
"and knife you
in your lower intestine.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.991
"I will then call Principal
Englehardt to help you,

06:14.040 --> 06:16.508
"but since he doesn't
receive or accept

06:16.540 --> 06:18.098
"parental calls
of concern,

06:18.140 --> 06:21.177
"you will
most probably bleed out.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.144
"Thank you for your concern,

06:23.180 --> 06:25.102
Alicia Florrick."

06:25.150 --> 06:27.778
Did you write this,
Mrs. Florrick?

06:27.820 --> 06:29.549
Okay.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.150
Just to be clear--
it was a joke.

06:32.190 --> 06:33.987
Have you ever seen
Darkness at Noon?

06:34.020 --> 06:36.159
No._
I was just

06:36.190 --> 06:39.182
quoting a threat
the hero makes to someone.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.697
I wrote it down

06:40.730 --> 06:43.119
to make Grace laugh.
It was just between us.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.627
It was never meant
to be delivered...

06:45.670 --> 06:47.137
to them.
Yes,

06:47.170 --> 06:48.194
and yet
here it is

06:48.240 --> 06:49.867
on my desk.
Alicia is a

06:49.910 --> 06:53.004
good mother.
She would never stab a teacher.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.179
Thank you, Jackie.
Uh, just to be clear--

06:55.210 --> 06:56.973
it was a joke.
About

06:57.010 --> 06:59.717
killing a teacher?
It wasn't meant...

06:59.750 --> 07:01.172
How did it get here anyway?

07:01.220 --> 07:02.744
Grace is in my civics class,

07:02.790 --> 07:04.917
_ and we were
discussmg free speech.

07:04.950 --> 07:06.588
Was satire protected

07:06.620 --> 07:09.783
as free speech?
And afterwards
I showed her the note.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.650
To ask if this
was protected.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.954
And you laughed.
You knew it was a joke.
I asked

07:14.000 --> 07:16.093
ifI could keep it.
To show it
to her husband. You said

07:16.130 --> 07:18.598
he'd get a laugh, too.
It's not Ms. Slavick's

07:18.630 --> 07:20.632
fault she brought
it to me. It's

07:20.670 --> 07:22.160
the responsibility
of all teachers

07:22.200 --> 07:24.236
to bring me threats
without fail.

07:24.270 --> 07:26.238
This is a threat.

07:26.270 --> 07:28.238
It's a joke.
We don't like jokes
like that here.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.545
I understand.
It won't happen again.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.468
Guys, I think we
should leave it there.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.249
JACKIE:
Good, then that's it.
It was all just

07:35.280 --> 07:37.510
a misunderstanding.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.484
DIANE:
And you think
you can be impartial

07:39.520 --> 07:41.112
during this trial?
MAN: I think I can do

07:41.160 --> 07:42.923
my best.
Mm-hmm. This juror

07:42.960 --> 07:44.825
is acceptable to the
defense, Your Honor.
We challenge

07:44.860 --> 07:46.794
this juror.
Oh, come on.

07:46.830 --> 07:48.127
Your Honor,
the prosecution has exhausted

07:48.160 --> 07:50.162
its peremptory challenges.
We ask for sidebar

07:50.200 --> 07:53.465
_conference.
All right, then get up
here . Come on, fast.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.660
We move to strike
for cause, Your Honor.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.530
This juror has a sister
who's a defense attorney.

07:58.570 --> 08:00.003
Your Honor, you have
accepted another juror

08:00.040 --> 08:01.735
with a policeman brother.
Look, you're wasting

08:01.780 --> 08:03.702
your time, ASA Pine.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.547
I said we'd done by 5:00.

08:05.580 --> 08:07.047
Now, I find this juror

08:07.080 --> 08:08.911
acceptable. You are seated, sir.

08:08.950 --> 08:11.111
So that completes
voir dire.

08:11.150 --> 08:13.755
And we will begin with
opening arguments tomorrow.
Your Honor,

08:13.790 --> 08:15.610
I have a motion.
No, ASA Pine.

08:15.660 --> 08:18.128
Tomorrow.
That ends our time today.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.594
And that means...
(gavelbangs)

08:20.630 --> 08:22.564
Oh, you're here. Welcome
to your campaign headquarters.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.965
They're arguing again.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.763
About the
interview?
I have no idea.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.234
I think they just like it.
...Eli, notjust
on a guilty verdict,

08:28.270 --> 08:30.602
but on a not
gUIlty verdict.
If we make it an issue,

08:30.640 --> 08:32.107
it becomes a story.
So we have a

08:32.140 --> 08:34.279
problem?
Cary's trial.
I think

08:34.310 --> 08:36.232
if it's a guilty verdict,
we don't say anything.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.771
We can't comment while
the verdict's under appeal.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.745
They're not gonna
let you get away with that.
Get away with what? We really

08:41.780 --> 08:43.042
shouldn't be commenting.
It'll look like she's

08:43.090 --> 08:44.739
betraying her partner.
Excuse me--

08:44.790 --> 08:46.246
that's not yours to say.
I have an opinion.

08:46.290 --> 08:48.281
Uh, no, you don't. Not when
you're the body woman.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.255
She's right, Eli. And you'd know
that if you'd been with us more.
Oh,

08:51.290 --> 08:53.053
come on, don't pull that one.
Let's be honest-_-
your focus is split.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.091
(both clamoring)
This story is only going
to become a story...

08:55.130 --> 08:57.121
Eli, Weekly
Correspondent's on one.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.592
Oh. Here we go.

08:58.630 --> 08:59.938
They want to talk
about Cary's trial.

08:59.970 --> 09:01.267
Eli, you don't
get to decide this.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.302
We decide this.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.864
Hey, Brian,
it's Johnny.

09:04.910 --> 09:06.263
How are you?
Good. I have

09:06.310 --> 09:08.335
a quote I need from you
on a story I'm chasing.

09:08.380 --> 09:10.143
Hi, Brian. Eli's here, too.

09:10.180 --> 09:11.977
Wow, I've got the two horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.216
What do you
need, Brian?

09:13.250 --> 09:14.979
So tell me this isn't true.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.739
Did Alicia Florrick threaten
to murder a Chicago teacher

09:17.790 --> 09:20.588
with a knife and then let him
bleed out like a pig?

09:22.660 --> 09:24.252
Uh, what?

09:24.290 --> 09:27.726
Did Alicia threaten to knife
one of her daughter's teachers?

09:27.760 --> 09:30.627
Brian, I...

09:30.670 --> 09:31.989
What are you
talking about?

09:32.030 --> 09:33.292
So that's an unequivocal no?

09:33.340 --> 09:35.194
Yes, it's a no.
Are you insane?

09:36.400 --> 09:37.936
Alicia.
I think

09:37.970 --> 09:39.904
you'd better
hear this.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.737
JOHNNY:
Uh, good talking
to you, Brian.

09:41.780 --> 09:44.078
Anytime you want to know about
flying saucers, call us, too.

09:44.110 --> 09:45.873
(chuckles)

09:45.910 --> 09:47.946
What was that?
Nothing, he-he...
We're good.

09:47.980 --> 09:49.379
He didn't even
mention Cary's trial.

09:49.420 --> 09:51.388
I think you'd better
tell Alicia what he asked.

09:51.420 --> 09:53.058
No, he was joking.

09:53.090 --> 09:54.717
Did you threaten
to murder

09:54.760 --> 09:56.216
one of your kid's
teachers and

09:56.260 --> 09:57.386
bleed him out
like a pig?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.648
(laughing)

10:05.330 --> 10:06.638
Alicia.

10:06.670 --> 10:10.106
Well, here's the thing.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.782
We can't now.
I have to head into court.

10:25.820 --> 10:28.755
No, you can't call me.
Not at home.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.781
I can't leave him. I can't.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.657
I'm going now.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.919
I'm going.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.996
And don't smile at me
on the stand or I'll crack up.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.009
Name and occupation, Detective?

10:44.040 --> 10:45.439
Gary Prima.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.131
I'm a detective with
the narcotics section

10:47.180 --> 10:49.375
of the Chicago
Police Department.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.242
Thank you,
Detective.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.145
And you had a
confidential informant

10:54.180 --> 10:56.273
record the defendant
committing this crime?
Objection,

10:56.320 --> 10:58.117
Your Honor.
Argumentative.

10:58.150 --> 11:00.015
That is correct.
Sustained.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.016
You had the defendant
record the defendant?

11:02.060 --> 11:03.186
The CI.
record the defendant?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.881
Yes. Sorry, yes.

11:05.930 --> 11:08.091
That's okay. Trey
Wagner was a member

11:08.130 --> 11:09.995
of Lemond Bishop's crew,
and he agreed to record

11:10.030 --> 11:12.169
Mr. Bishop's attorney,
Cary Agos.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.395
GENEVA:
And do you have that
recording for this court?

11:14.440 --> 11:15.998
Objection, Your
Honor. Hearsay.
I think we've been

11:16.040 --> 11:18.008
over this, Your Honor.
Forfeiture by wrongdoing.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.701
Yep, as I
warned you,

11:19.740 --> 11:22.038
Ms. Lockhart,
this recording is subject

11:22.080 --> 11:24.071
to a hearsay
exception.

11:24.110 --> 11:25.941
So, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

11:25.980 --> 11:28.949
I want you to know...
Excuse me, gentlemen.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.949
There is no cross talk
in the jury box.

11:31.990 --> 11:35.118
The only one in court who should
be talking is me. Now,

11:35.160 --> 11:37.981
I will allow this tape
to be played,

11:38.030 --> 11:40.225
but I want you to take
into account that the defense

11:40.260 --> 11:42.421
will not be able
to cross-examine

11:42.460 --> 11:44.963
the person who
recorded the tape.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.422
That person
is dead.

11:46.470 --> 11:49.268
So you may feel that
this tape is not worthy

11:49.300 --> 11:51.063
of your full
consideration

11:51.110 --> 11:53.078
because you're not
hearing both sides of it.

11:53.110 --> 11:54.771
But I leave
that to you.

11:54.810 --> 11:56.949
Now, Ms. Pine.
Ms. Pine?

11:56.980 --> 11:57.947
Yes.
Ms. Pine,

11:57.980 --> 11:59.072
you may continue.

11:59.110 --> 12:01.010
Yes, Your Honor.

12:01.050 --> 12:05.009
We ask leave to mark this tape
as People's exhibit number one.

12:05.050 --> 12:06.984
_ TREY: _
You're Bishop's lavwer, right?

12:07.020 --> 12:08.180
CARY:
Yeah. Yeah, I'm one of 'em.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.188
TREY:
So I have a question for you.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.754
(loud static)

12:11.790 --> 12:14.020
TREY: So you don't have
to show them anything?

12:14.060 --> 12:16.028
CARY:
No, no,
you just identify yourself.

12:16.060 --> 12:18.028
If you're not driving a car,

12:18.070 --> 12:20.334
you don't need all that.
They can't search you?

12:20.370 --> 12:21.997
CARY:
Well, how much
are we talking about here?

12:22.040 --> 12:25.168
TREY: Uh, 1 kilos.
VVhoa!

12:25.210 --> 12:26.359
Someone's having a big party!

12:26.410 --> 12:29.174
Damn, man! What do you got?

12:29.210 --> 12:30.507
ELI:
What did I say about jokes?

12:30.550 --> 12:33.178
It was a joke from months ago.
JOHNNY:
You said

12:33.220 --> 12:36.212
you were gonna stab him.
It was from Darkn_ess_at
Noon. I was quoting it.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.478
Oh, really? Which episode?
Marissa.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.215
Why write the note at all?
The P.E. teacher

12:39.250 --> 12:40.854
was shaming Grace
into running laps

12:40.890 --> 12:42.255
around the school
when she was Sick.

12:42.290 --> 12:44.155
So you threatened to kill him.
Yes, Eli.

12:44.190 --> 12:46.920
I threatened to kill him.
That was a joke.
You can't joke.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.053
What are we gonna say?
We got to get back to Brian
at the Correspondent.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.897
He's quoting us saying
it's false.
The note. We have

12:50.930 --> 12:53.069
to get the note. Who has it?
The civics teacher.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.136
Okay, you need to...
Wait, I thought you said

12:55.170 --> 12:57.229
it was the PE. teacher.
It was addressed
to the RE. teacher.

12:57.270 --> 12:58.965
Grace gave it to
the civics teacher.
Oh, dear God,

12:59.010 --> 13:01.103
this is a nightmare.
The only bad people

13:01.140 --> 13:03.142
to have in your life
are teachers.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.307
I'd trust assassins
over teachers.

13:05.350 --> 13:07.978
This was my childhood.
People ask why I turned
out the way I did.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.113
So your daughter's got
to get the note back.
You have to call Grace.

13:10.150 --> 13:12.015
I got it.
We can't say
it's a joke.

13:12.050 --> 13:13.517
No, not without
a long explanation.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.879
It's like we're joking
about school violence.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.114
Wait. Okay.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.025
She cares so much
about her daughter...

13:18.060 --> 13:20.153
She threatens
to knife a teacher.
No, no.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.350
Alicia didn't write the note--
her daughter did.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.868
I'm not saying that.
She wrote it as an example

13:24.900 --> 13:27.437
of what not to... something.

13:27.470 --> 13:30.166
MARISSA: No, it's a joke.
It's the truth. It's a joke.
What's the joke?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.462
She's Alicia Florrick.
Does she look like the type

13:32.510 --> 13:34.501
who would knife a teacher?
That's the joke.

13:34.540 --> 13:36.132
Sometimes it's funny to say
the thing that'll never happen.

13:36.180 --> 13:37.169
We've all done it.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.512
Okay, you need to get the note.

13:40.550 --> 13:42.518
That's the bottom line.
We can spin this,

13:42.550 --> 13:43.983
but you need
to get the note.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.511
Grace. Uh, we
need your help.

13:46.550 --> 13:49.314
Do you have civics today?
DIANE:
Detective Prima,

13:49.360 --> 13:51.453
was Trey Wagner your
confidential informant?

13:51.490 --> 13:53.151
PRIMA:
Yes, he was.
And when was the last time

13:53.200 --> 13:55.998
you spoke with him?
The last time? Probably...

13:56.030 --> 13:58.362
two months ago,
just before he disappeared.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.459
DIANE:
Didn't you speak with him
on the phone a month ago?

14:02.470 --> 14:06.258
I don't think ASA Pine has
the answer to that, Detective.

14:06.310 --> 14:08.972
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.
Well, let's see

14:09.010 --> 14:12.241
where this goes. Then we'll see
how relevant it is.
DIANE: Detective,

14:12.280 --> 14:14.976
did you speak with Trey
Wagner four weeks ago?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.442
PRIMA:
I spoke to someone
who identified himself

14:16.480 --> 14:18.141
as Trey Wagner,

14:18.190 --> 14:20.385
but I wasn't...
I couldn't be... sure.

14:20.420 --> 14:25.028
But ASA Finn Polmar assured you
that it was Trey Wagner?

14:25.060 --> 14:27.199
Yes, he did.
And did this person
on the phone tell you

14:27.230 --> 14:28.458
that he had set up Cary Agos?

14:28.500 --> 14:30.092
Objection, Your Honor.
Hearsay.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.620
Your Honor, the
ASA has opened

14:31.670 --> 14:33.638
the door by presenting
hearsay testimony

14:33.670 --> 14:35.399
from this missing witness.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.998
She should
not be allowed

14:37.040 --> 14:39.201
to now argue that
these hearsay statements

14:39.240 --> 14:41.299
are inadmissible because
they hurt her case.

14:41.340 --> 14:44.275
CUESTA:
Well, she's got you
there, ASA Pine.

14:44.310 --> 14:47.347
Overruled. _
You may answer, Detective.

14:47.380 --> 14:49.416
Yes. This person

14:49.450 --> 14:52.010
said that he had
set up Cary Agos.

14:52.050 --> 14:55.019
DIANE: And how did he do that?
By selectively turning
the wire on and off

14:55.060 --> 14:58.427
to make Mr. Agos' statements
seem more damning.
And did he say

14:58.460 --> 15:00.519
why he did that?
He said he
was afraid

15:00.560 --> 15:04.166
of Mr. Bishop, and he had
to get us someone lower.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.169
DIANE:
Meaning Cary. And how
long after he said this

15:07.200 --> 15:08.963
was Trey
Wagner killed?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.536
Objection.
Excuse me.
How long

15:10.570 --> 15:13.676
after this did Trey Wagner die
in a car accident

15:13.710 --> 15:17.100
that the police have
called suspicious?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.344
48 hours.
I see.

15:18.380 --> 15:19.574
Thank you,
Your Honor.

15:19.610 --> 15:22.215
Okay,
how exciting.

15:22.250 --> 15:25.947
And we are adjourned for lunch.

15:25.990 --> 15:28.959
* Sweet Caroline

15:28.990 --> 15:30.389
* Ba-ba

15:30.430 --> 15:31.988
* Ba, ba...

15:32.030 --> 15:33.122
MARISSA:
Foundit

15:33.160 --> 15:34.718
Uh, hold on, Grace. Hold on.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.263
"Grizzly Mom in Illinois
Race Shows Claws."

15:37.300 --> 15:38.221
Good headline.
Where is it?

15:38.270 --> 15:40.261
BuzzFeed.
Politics.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.268
"Don't get Alicia
Florrick angry.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.234
"It's reported
that Alicia Florrick

15:44.270 --> 15:46.067
"threatened a teacher
at her daughter's

15:46.110 --> 15:47.372
"tony high school
with violence

15:47.410 --> 15:49.537
for forcing her daughter
to work out while sick."

15:49.580 --> 15:52.276
It doesn't have
the note?
No, it doesn't.

15:52.310 --> 15:54.119
Hi. Sorry, Grace.
What did she say?

15:54.150 --> 15:55.549
She says she wants
to give you back the note,

15:55.580 --> 15:57.218
but first she wants
to meet you in person.

15:57.250 --> 15:58.979
What? Why?

15:59.020 --> 16:00.351
I don't know.
I think she wants to make sure

16:00.390 --> 16:02.085
you don't threaten
to kill someone again.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.384
Dear Lord...
I thought she was nice.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.488
Now I'm not so sure.

16:05.530 --> 16:07.088
(sighs)
Okay. I'll call her.

16:07.130 --> 16:08.495
Sorry to put you through this.

16:08.530 --> 16:11.021
Mom, you didn't. I did.
No.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.493
I need to stop joking.
They need to get
a sense of humor.

16:13.540 --> 16:17.135
(chuckles)
Okay. Love you. Bye.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.273
You're nice with your daughter.

16:20.310 --> 16:23.245
(phone rings)
Hi, Jon. What's wrong?

16:23.280 --> 16:25.373
Yeah, BuzzFeed.
The politics section.

16:26.750 --> 16:29.071
ELI:
That points
to a way out of this.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.680
Yeah, hang on a second.
I got Eli on speaker.
It points to a way out of this.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.483
We need to push you
as a grizzly mom.
Yeah,

16:33.520 --> 16:35.317
I agree. It's all about
how much you love your daughter.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.328
I tried to stab a teacher
because I love my daughter?

16:37.360 --> 16:40.329
ELI:
Alicia, are you joking? Remember
what I said about joking?

16:40.360 --> 16:43.488
JOHNNY:
If we leave it vague, then,
uh, we can argue grizzly mom.

16:43.530 --> 16:45.293
But the minute the note
is out there, then it becomes

16:45.330 --> 16:46.695
about knives and bleeding out.

16:46.730 --> 16:48.391
So you need to get that note.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.668
Yeah, I'm working
on it.
Uh-oh.

16:49.700 --> 16:53.409
I'm really starting
to hate those syllables.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.374
PRADY:
Are you asking me how
I would handle school violence?

16:55.410 --> 16:58.402
MAN:
Yes, but any school violence.
JOHNNY: What are you watching?

16:58.450 --> 17:01.317
Frank Prady.
With the Correspondent board.
PRADY: Well, let me say this,

17:01.350 --> 17:03.341
if a teacher or a student
threatened to knife

17:03.390 --> 17:05.779
a teacher, yes,
I would prosecute him.

17:05.820 --> 17:07.685
Or her?
Yes.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.358
To the fullest extent
of the law.

17:09.390 --> 17:11.756
And, yes, if there were even
merely a written threat,

17:11.790 --> 17:14.156
I would prosecute.
School violence

17:14.200 --> 17:17.761
is too serious
to treat as a joke.
Alicia, he's coming after you.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.337
We need to use our oppo on him.
Yeah, we're ready to go.
I've got

17:20.370 --> 17:23.464
two sources that'll
say he's closeted.
_ _ Our _
fingerprints are never on it.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.808
JOHNNY: We point the reporter to
the source. They're starving
for it at this point anyway.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.536
ELI: If they don't go
for a Prady story, they'll go
after you for the knifing.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.844
Yeah, Alicia, we don't agree
on much, but we agree on this.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.768
Okay, give me till tonight.
ELI:
Alicia,

17:32.810 --> 17:34.675
remember what I said
about things moving fast.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.417
Eli, please, we'll talk tonight.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.354
You gave them reasonable doubt.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.389
I know.

17:49.430 --> 17:51.227
Do you know
what to do?

17:51.270 --> 17:52.498
I do.
Good.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.394
Do it.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.435
We cannot
lose this.

18:05.610 --> 18:08.579
So?

18:08.620 --> 18:09.814
It's over between us?
I can't.

18:09.850 --> 18:11.784
Right. Yeah.
If it were another time.

18:11.820 --> 18:12.809
Now that you don't need me.

18:12.850 --> 18:13.851
That's not fair.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.778
(door slams)

18:18.790 --> 18:21.395
Okay.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.790
Now kick some ass.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.504
Yes, Your Honor.
We have another witness.

18:30.540 --> 18:31.768
Goody
for you.

18:31.810 --> 18:32.663
Who is it?

18:32.710 --> 18:34.701
Kalinda Sharma.

18:48.860 --> 18:49.383
(door opens)

18:49.420 --> 18:50.853
Let's go. Sidebar over.

18:50.890 --> 18:52.482
(sighs)

18:52.530 --> 18:56.250
DIANE:_
I strongly object to
this breach of protocol,

18:56.300 --> 18:58.268
Your Honor.
Of course you object...

18:58.300 --> 19:00.598
DIANE:
She was not on the final
witness list, Your Honor.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.164
GENEVA:
Your Honor, the speedy
trial provision

19:02.200 --> 19:03.428
should follow the
same freeway.

19:03.470 --> 19:05.904
CUESTA:
All right, enough.
Enough. The witness

19:05.940 --> 19:08.579
is in the woods and ready to
be questioned. So let's go.

19:08.610 --> 19:10.168
You may proceed.

19:11.980 --> 19:13.743
Name and occupation, please?

19:13.780 --> 19:15.816
Kalinda Sharma.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.512
I work _
as a freelance investigator.

19:18.550 --> 19:20.279
GENEVA:
And do you
primarily work

19:20.320 --> 19:22.686
for Mr. Agos' firm,
Funnel, Ador & Lookout?

19:22.720 --> 19:24.654
Yes. Primarily.

19:24.690 --> 19:26.419
To your knowledge,

19:26.460 --> 19:28.428
did Cary Agos work
for Lumar Bishop

19:28.460 --> 19:31.623
when he was emperor
of the Lal\ll<e District?
0.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.194
He definitely was not.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.196
Kalinda Sharma,
are you Cary Agos' hunter?

19:35.240 --> 19:36.935
DIANE:
Objection, Your Honor.

19:36.970 --> 19:38.369
This is an old lavwer trick.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.230
GENEVA:
I'm not trying to trick.
List Pine

19:40.280 --> 19:42.339
is lying under the question
and possible movement...

19:42.380 --> 19:44.507
I'll arm dresser, Your Honor,
and cobbling the witness...
No, no, no.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.314
This is not a time for a debit.

19:47.350 --> 19:48.874
(quietly):
I-I didn't hear.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.342
What did she say?

19:50.390 --> 19:51.379
Who say?

19:51.420 --> 19:52.944
The prosecutor,
what did she ask?

19:52.990 --> 19:54.981
She said,
"Are you Cary Agos' lover?"

19:55.020 --> 19:58.319
Ah.
...old lumberjack. Asking
leading questions and making

19:58.360 --> 19:59.952
it appear
like the wasted is nothing.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.696
The objection
is sustained.

20:01.730 --> 20:03.322
DIANE:
Your Honor,
we ask that you

20:03.370 --> 20:04.189
abstract nunneries.
(Sighs)

20:04.230 --> 20:07.666
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, I ask

20:07.700 --> 20:11.306
that you disregard the questions
and answers that you just heard.

20:11.340 --> 20:14.229
They have been
deemed inadmissible.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.241
Hi.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.882
Hey.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.809
Have we been avoiding
each other?

20:27.860 --> 20:30.829
I... don't think that we have,

20:30.860 --> 20:34.398
but... we should probably talk
anyway.

20:42.770 --> 20:44.738
I don't want to avoid you.

20:44.770 --> 20:46.499
I know.
I-I hate awloNardness
at work...

20:46.540 --> 20:48.508
I do, too. It's idiotic.
Exactly.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.679
Like high school.
So here's the thing,
Okay, so let's not.

20:50.710 --> 20:53.372
I like you as a friend. It's
stupid to drop a friendship
And I like you.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.048
just because...
Exactly.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.641
(sighs)
So here's what we do.
We-we have rules.

20:59.690 --> 21:01.282
Good. Love it.
We meet

21:01.320 --> 21:03.322
in brightly lit diners,
not bars.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.521
Pancakes, not drinks.
Yes. And we...

21:05.560 --> 21:09.326
talk about... the law.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.521
Great. With accordion music.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.663
Well, unfortunately, accordion
music kind of turns me on.

21:13.700 --> 21:16.635
(chuckles)

21:18.640 --> 21:20.437
Okay. No music.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.833
I'll see you.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.378
So what the hell?

21:27.420 --> 21:30.344
Excuse me?
You leaked
to the press

21:30.390 --> 21:33.018
these two guys who said
they had an affair with
me? I thought we agreed...

21:33.050 --> 21:35.484
Wait, wait, what?
You leaked to the press...

21:35.520 --> 21:38.057
I did not.
O-Or your people.
Your handlers did it.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.081
Excuse me, we did not.
Do we have
an agreement

21:40.130 --> 21:42.849
or don't we? We said
we wouldn't smear each other.

21:42.900 --> 21:45.095
Wait a minute. Who's the one
who went to the Correspondent

21:45.130 --> 21:48.634
and told them
that I should be prosecuted?
Are you serious?

21:48.670 --> 21:51.036
You wanted to roll_
a one-day story into a fight.

21:51.070 --> 21:53.379
I didn't know
you threatened to stab

21:53.410 --> 21:56.504
a teacher.
The story was already out.

21:56.540 --> 21:58.349
Well, so? They didn't offer me
any context.

21:58.380 --> 22:00.416
They just asked me
if I would prosecute a woman

22:00.450 --> 22:03.044
for threatening to stab a
teacher, and, yes, oddly enough,

22:03.080 --> 22:06.345
I said yes. I-I didn't know
it was about you.

22:06.390 --> 22:08.915
Then correct it.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.428
Correct what?
Tell the Correspondent that

22:11.460 --> 22:13.121
you know what
I wrote was a joke,

22:13.160 --> 22:16.129
and that they were wrong
to take it out of context.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.459
Ah, are we not friends
anymore, Frank?

22:19.500 --> 22:21.798
Wait a minute. Our agreement
wasn't to help each other win.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.467
It was just
that we not fight dirty.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.102
And you did.
I didn't.

22:25.140 --> 22:26.732
I didn't know
what they were saying.

22:26.770 --> 22:28.806
Okay.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.604
Then let's just leave it there.

22:31.650 --> 22:34.778
So, you're gonna let
your handlers leak dirt on me,

22:34.820 --> 22:36.469
dirt you know isn't true?

22:36.520 --> 22:39.148
I have no knowledge that
my handlers did any such thing.

22:39.190 --> 22:41.511
Wow.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.620
So we're right back
where we started.
0.

22:44.660 --> 22:47.356
We're even in the polls now.

23:09.580 --> 23:12.686
Well, then, we will
return to chambers.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.119
DIANE:
Oh, Your Honor, I object.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.616
CUESTA:
And you're overruled.

23:15.660 --> 23:18.458
Sheriff, please
excuse the jurors.

23:18.490 --> 23:21.095
Uh, all except
juror number 11.

23:21.130 --> 23:24.019
Please escort
him to chambers.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.425
ALICIA:
Why?

23:26.470 --> 23:28.438
What happened?
CARY:
I don't know.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.768
They took our only
slam-dunk juror into chambers.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.437
You think
Geneva's trying to bounce her?

23:32.470 --> 23:34.438
Him, and it looks like it.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.799
Well, how's the alternate?

23:35.840 --> 23:37.603
Bad.

23:37.650 --> 23:38.799
Both are bad.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.477
Keep me in touch?

23:40.520 --> 23:43.080
Thank you for
coming, Alicia.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.485
I know you
must be busy.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.488
Oh, never too busy
for Grace's teachers.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.511
So, I-I know you
want this note back.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.653
I'm so sorry how this got
blown out of proportion.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.829
I knew you were joking,
but the liability issues...

23:52.860 --> 23:54.452
I understand.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.923
So, Grace said
you wanted to talk to me?

23:56.960 --> 23:59.622
My husband works with
the teacher's union,

23:59.670 --> 24:02.537
and over the last five years,
there has been a decrease

24:02.570 --> 24:05.505
in school crime oversight
in the S.A.'s office.

24:05.540 --> 24:07.633
Really?
Yes.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.500
It's terrible.

24:09.540 --> 24:12.475
There used to be a task force
made up of eight teachers

24:12.510 --> 24:15.217
who would advise the state's
attorney on school crime.

24:15.250 --> 24:18.219
And you would like
to have that back?

24:18.250 --> 24:20.559
Yes, we would love
to have that back.

24:20.590 --> 24:23.582
With eight positions set aside
for teacher union members.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.451
That would be
really great for us.

24:28.230 --> 24:29.595
Just give it to her.
No.

24:29.630 --> 24:30.699
It's patronage.
Well, of course,

24:30.730 --> 24:31.890
it's patronage, Alicia.

24:31.930 --> 24:32.999
How do you think
this thing works?

24:33.030 --> 24:34.531
Eli, I said "no" to patronage.

24:34.570 --> 24:36.037
And I congratulate you
on that stance, Alicia,

24:36.070 --> 24:37.935
but you need this note
not to circulate.

24:37.970 --> 24:39.562
Alicia, it's important

24:39.610 --> 24:40.770
to show that you stand up
to patronage,

24:40.810 --> 24:42.607
but the key word here is "show."

24:42.640 --> 24:44.244
There is some patronage
that everybody accepts.

24:44.280 --> 24:45.907
Your husband
accepted...
Oy.

24:45.950 --> 24:48.771
Exactly. I'm not going
to be like Peter.

24:52.090 --> 24:54.650
You know. Ethics.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.622
Mr. Fratti, is it?

24:58.660 --> 24:59.957
It is. What's wrong?

24:59.990 --> 25:02.493
Have a seat.

25:04.170 --> 25:09.198
Uh, I have a note here
from an anonymous juror reading,

25:09.240 --> 25:12.300
"I thinkjuror number 11
might be partially deaf.

25:12.340 --> 25:15.673
"He is having trouble
understanding the proceedings,

25:15.710 --> 25:19.646
and he continually asks those
around him what's going on."

25:19.680 --> 25:21.318
Now, are you partially deaf,
Mr. Fratti?

25:21.350 --> 25:23.545
No.
GENEVA:
Your Honor, I...

25:23.590 --> 25:25.546
Excuse me.
You told us not to talk.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.558
Stop it. 1-1 understand
what's going on here.

25:27.590 --> 25:30.184
Ms. Lockhart, you think
he's pro-defense,

25:30.220 --> 25:33.189
and you want him to stay, and,
Ms. Pine, you want him to go.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.619
Well, shush, both of you.

25:35.660 --> 25:38.163
Now, Mr. Fratti,

25:38.200 --> 25:40.065
is there anything
that would prevent you

25:40.100 --> 25:41.863
from understanding this trial?

25:41.900 --> 25:43.868
I didn't hide anything.
I know that, sir.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.332
Is there anything

25:45.370 --> 25:47.258
that would prevent
your understanding?

25:49.840 --> 25:52.809
During certain moments
of stress,

25:52.850 --> 25:55.148
I can suffer from APD--

25:55.180 --> 25:56.909
Auditory Processing Disorder.

25:56.950 --> 25:59.043
CUESTA:
And why didn't you mention this
during voir dire?

25:59.090 --> 26:01.888
Because it only
rarely affects me,

26:01.920 --> 26:03.649
which was the question
put to me.

26:03.690 --> 26:05.749
On occasion,
I can have difficulty

26:05.790 --> 26:08.258
with the sequencing of words,
or confuse similar sounds.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.325
But did this

26:10.360 --> 26:12.225
affect you during trial?

26:14.200 --> 26:16.088
and I have certain
coping mechanisms...

26:16.140 --> 26:18.700
Your Honor, this is...
He says he has
followed the trial.

26:18.740 --> 26:20.674
Wait, wait, wait.

26:20.710 --> 26:23.338
Mr. Fratti,
I have a question for you.

26:24.710 --> 26:27.076
What waxing the number

26:27.110 --> 26:28.941
of the last wideness?

26:28.980 --> 26:30.379
Your Honor,
it is not a common name.

26:30.420 --> 26:32.240
GENEVA:
How is that relevant?

26:32.290 --> 26:34.656
Ms. Lockhart, please!
We're not in a schoolyard.

26:34.690 --> 26:37.921
Now, what did I ask you,
Mr. Fratti?

26:37.960 --> 26:39.655
You asked me the name
of the last witness,

26:39.690 --> 26:41.624
and I think
it was Kalinda something?

26:41.660 --> 26:43.252
GENEVA:
Your Honor, may I
ask a question?

26:43.300 --> 26:46.189
No, but I will.
The question, Mr. Fratti,

26:46.230 --> 26:50.189
is whether Cary Agos hurt lemons

26:50.240 --> 26:53.903
bussing the important
tree-mills of honeycuts.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.252
Um, I'm sorry.

27:11.290 --> 27:13.929
Ithought
you were innocent.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.292
I need your help, Kalinda.
We don't have

27:19.330 --> 27:21.764
a strong
enough case.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.879
Um, I'm sorry.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.808
Ithought
you were innocent.

27:45.890 --> 27:47.755
I need your help, Kalinda.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.950
We don't have
a strong enough case.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.889
Let me see
what I can do, okay?

27:55.300 --> 27:56.858
ALICIA:
How's it going?

27:56.900 --> 27:58.458
Notgood.
Cary lost his juror.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.831
Damn it.
How can I help?

28:00.880 --> 28:02.279
We need to get a lead on Dante.

28:02.310 --> 28:03.777
Bishop's man?

28:03.810 --> 28:05.141
Yeah. He's the only one
still alive

28:05.180 --> 28:06.943
who heard what was edited
out of the wire.

28:06.980 --> 28:09.210
I can't get anything from Finn.

28:09.250 --> 28:11.889
Alicia, he knows
that Cary is innocent, he knows

28:11.920 --> 28:13.444
this is a wrongful prosecution,
and

28:13.490 --> 28:16.050
he will hear it if you say it.

28:16.090 --> 28:20.186
Just ask him for any lead that
could get us to Dante, anything.

28:20.230 --> 28:22.152
Okay, I'll see what I can do.
ELI:
You're kidding me.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.828
JOHNNY:
"I will personally come down
to your office, and knife you

28:24.870 --> 28:25.894
in your lower intestines..."

28:25.930 --> 28:27.420
ELI:
"You will most probably

28:27.470 --> 28:29.199
bleed out."

28:29.240 --> 28:30.867
You know, for some reason,
I thought this was

28:30.910 --> 28:32.866
gonna be funnier.
Where is it, on a blog?

28:32.910 --> 28:34.969
Yeah. The Correspondent blog.
Give her the patronage, Alicia.

28:35.010 --> 28:36.500
What's it matter now?
You need the union.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.178
(sighs)

28:38.210 --> 28:41.179
I have to go.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.176
MAN:
Order up.

28:43.220 --> 28:45.438
Cleanup. Can I get
cleanup over here?

28:45.490 --> 28:47.344
(laughing)

28:47.390 --> 28:50.052
Well, you succeeded

28:50.090 --> 28:52.285
in finding
the ugliest diner in Chicago.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.093
(sighs)
Oh!

28:54.130 --> 28:55.927
Well, it helps that we
both smell like wet dogs.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.894
(laughs)

28:57.930 --> 29:01.866
And pancakes. Perfect.

29:04.310 --> 29:07.131
So, fellow lavwer...
Mm-hmm.

29:07.170 --> 29:10.776
I have a request that's gonna
make us both uncomfortable.

29:10.810 --> 29:13.244
Great. That's why I'm here.
You heard about Cary's trial?

29:13.280 --> 29:15.316
He lost a juror.
Yes.

29:15.350 --> 29:17.272
We need to find Dante.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.311
He's the only one still alive

29:19.350 --> 29:21.557
who can testify
that Cary's innocent,

29:21.590 --> 29:23.979
that the wire was edited.
(thunder crackling)

29:24.030 --> 29:25.258
You know I can't
say anything.
I do.

29:25.290 --> 29:27.121
It's just, I thought...

29:27.160 --> 29:28.559
(indistinct chatter)

29:28.600 --> 29:31.990
Well, that's not good.

29:32.030 --> 29:34.089
WAITRESS:
It's the storm. Hold on.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.961
You were saying?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.467
(rain pouring)

29:38.510 --> 29:42.037
I was saying?
No, I think you-you were...

29:42.080 --> 29:44.298
Oh, yeah. Um...

29:44.350 --> 29:46.306
yeah.

29:46.350 --> 29:49.012
I can't say anything.

29:49.050 --> 29:51.348
(guitar plays
upbeat, gentle melody)

29:51.390 --> 29:53.858
(singing in Italian)

29:53.890 --> 29:56.358
(laughs)

29:56.390 --> 29:58.449
You're kidding.
(laughs)

29:58.490 --> 30:00.321
(laughing)

30:00.360 --> 30:02.021
Of course.

30:02.060 --> 30:04.858
So, you can't say anything?

30:04.900 --> 30:07.266
I can't.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.371
What's that?

30:14.410 --> 30:16.833
I can't say anything.

30:16.880 --> 30:20.179
Surveillance photos
from Bishop's house.

30:20.210 --> 30:22.917
Anybody entering
or exiting.

30:22.950 --> 30:25.885
Of course, I don't know
how you got 'em, because, uh,

30:25.920 --> 30:29.117
well... I can't say anything.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.553
BISHOP:
I wasn't even there!

30:36.600 --> 30:38.397
WOMAN:
Yes, you were!
Why are you lying to me?

30:38.430 --> 30:41.194
BISHOP:
I'm not lying.
You won't listen.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.435
(arguing continues indistinctly)

30:45.910 --> 30:48.003
My dad's fighting.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.439
Oh.
(indistinct shouting)

30:49.480 --> 30:52.074
He'll be right here.
It's just his girlfriend.

30:52.110 --> 30:53.509
Sure.

30:53.550 --> 30:55.074
BISHOP:
It's not...
it's not your business!

30:57.120 --> 30:59.179
Do you work
with my dad?

30:59.220 --> 31:01.415
Uh, sometimes.

31:01.460 --> 31:05.282
Do you come here
after school?

31:05.330 --> 31:07.150
Yeah. Why?

31:07.190 --> 31:09.397
No reason.
Is that at 3:00?

31:09.430 --> 31:12.092
BISHOP:
Okay? This is not gonna work

31:12.130 --> 31:14.439
if you don't trust me.
You need to trust me.

31:14.470 --> 31:17.064
Very adult.

31:18.540 --> 31:21.134
Dylan, it's time
to go to bed.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.329
I know.

31:25.150 --> 31:27.243
BISHOP:
I love you.
DYLAN: You, too.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.909
What do you need, Kalinda?

31:33.190 --> 31:35.317
Dante.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.022
Yeah. A lot of people
need Dante.

31:38.060 --> 31:39.425
Why are you coming to me?

31:39.460 --> 31:41.428
Because I think you
know where he is.

31:41.460 --> 31:44.167
And if you wanted him
to testify, he would.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.327
All right, then maybe
I don't want him to testify.

31:46.370 --> 31:48.167
(sighs)
It's-it's a little late.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.997
Can-can we do this
another time?

31:50.040 --> 31:52.201
I have some photos
I need you to see.

31:55.110 --> 31:58.147
These are state's attorney

31:58.180 --> 32:00.444
surveillance photos
of your house.

32:05.250 --> 32:08.959
Kalinda... I know you like Cary,

32:08.990 --> 32:13.381
but you shouldn't be here
saying that to me.

32:13.430 --> 32:16.319
And you shouldn't be here
with such a weak weapon.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.464
These are four
known drug dealers

32:18.500 --> 32:20.092
entering your front door.

32:20.130 --> 32:21.358
Yeah, well, too bad.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.391
I'm not there. Do you see me
in that picture?

32:23.440 --> 32:26.000
Oh, you don't need
to be there, sir.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.429
For them to arrest me,
I sure do.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.630
This is not about you.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.604
This is about Dylan.

32:37.350 --> 32:40.478
There's enough here for Child
Services to take your son away.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.497
These are copies.

32:49.530 --> 32:52.169
They are not originals.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.360
Anyone know you're here?

32:59.540 --> 33:01.701
Yeah.

33:03.540 --> 33:06.247
What the hell do you think
you're doing?!

33:06.280 --> 33:08.475
Who do you think I am?
I'm not...

33:08.520 --> 33:10.545
No. You come here
to threaten me?

33:10.580 --> 33:13.583
You come here
to threaten my son?
I'm not threatening you.

33:13.620 --> 33:16.111
Look, we want to help you...

33:16.160 --> 33:18.526
but... we need your help.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.721
Get out of here, Kalinda...

33:20.760 --> 33:23.593
before I think
about this too much.

33:25.730 --> 33:28.164
*

33:37.580 --> 33:39.673
How did you
find Dante?

33:39.710 --> 33:41.712
Don't tell me.

33:43.150 --> 33:45.118
You're a lifesaver.

33:45.150 --> 33:47.584
Looking forward
to this being over.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.451
DIANE:
Uh, Your Honor,
we have a new name

33:51.490 --> 33:55.324
to add to the witness list--
Dante Wallach.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.269
DANTE:
Dante Wallach.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.063
DIANE:
And you know the defendant?

34:05.110 --> 34:07.101
That guy? Yeah.
And you were
in Mr. Bishop's

34:07.140 --> 34:09.074
kitchen with him

34:09.110 --> 34:11.078
on May 25 of this year?

34:11.110 --> 34:12.270
Yeah.
And did you

34:12.310 --> 34:15.313
ask him questions
about your business?

34:17.850 --> 34:19.488
DANTE:
Yeah.

34:19.520 --> 34:23.149
DIANE: And you have heard
the prosecutor's tape

34:23.190 --> 34:24.122
of this conversation?

34:24.160 --> 34:25.422
DANTE:
The wire? Yeah.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.781
DIANE:
And does this tape...

34:27.830 --> 34:30.151
reflect your conversation?

34:30.200 --> 34:31.599
DANTE:
Yeah. I-I mean...

34:31.630 --> 34:33.791
What do you mean?
Did Cary tell you

34:33.830 --> 34:35.639
how to break the law?

34:36.670 --> 34:38.103
Yeah.

34:38.140 --> 34:40.131
DIANE:
Uh, Mr. Wallach,

34:40.170 --> 34:41.774
let me ask you again...

34:41.810 --> 34:44.779
GENEVA:
I think he already answered.
I am asking whether Cary

34:44.810 --> 34:47.142
told you that
he couldn't help you

34:47.180 --> 34:50.809
break the law.
DANTE: No, he told us
how to break the law.

34:50.850 --> 34:54.149
How to be smart about it.
DIANE:
Uh, Mr. Wallach, excuse me,

34:54.190 --> 34:57.216
but you told us outside
of this court the exact opposite

34:57.260 --> 34:59.228
of what you're saying here.
DANTE:
Nah.

34:59.260 --> 35:00.659
Maybe you misheard it.
Is someone

35:00.690 --> 35:02.248
threatening you, Mr. Wallach?

35:02.300 --> 35:04.393
Objection, Your Honor.
Argumentative.

35:04.430 --> 35:06.193
DIANE:
Uh, then I need a sidebar,
Your Honor.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.289
CUESTA:
Sure, come on up.
Let's do this.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.558
(quietly): Don't you
ever threaten me again,
do you understand?

35:10.600 --> 35:12.568
Get him to tell the truth.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.578
I need to know that
you understand, Kalinda.

35:14.610 --> 35:16.237
I understand, sir.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.702
Now, get him
to tell the truth.

35:17.740 --> 35:20.868
That's your problem.

35:20.910 --> 35:23.549
CUESTA:
All right, enough, enough.
The witness...

35:47.470 --> 35:50.303

KALIN DA:
Cary.

35:50.340 --> 35:51.739
Look.

35:51.780 --> 35:53.941
I will talk to him again.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.379
No.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.615
You can't.

35:57.650 --> 36:00.244
You can't take the plea.

36:03.890 --> 36:05.949
Four months ago...

36:05.990 --> 36:09.289
my life was... it was just that,
it was my life,

36:09.330 --> 36:12.390
and now I don't know what it is.

36:12.430 --> 36:15.797
I go from one nightmare
to another,

36:15.840 --> 36:18.707
and I just want it to be over.

36:18.740 --> 36:21.379
They're gonna
convict me.

36:21.410 --> 36:23.378
We don't have a case.

36:23.410 --> 36:25.207
I look at the jury...

36:25.250 --> 36:28.242
and they want to put me away.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.510

DIANE:
Cary,

36:30.550 --> 36:33.348
do you have
a minute?
Oh, yeah.

36:36.260 --> 36:38.854
Geneva has a new offer.
(clears throat)

36:38.890 --> 36:40.619
Mr. Agos.

36:42.260 --> 36:43.557
Hello.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.363
The state's attorney

36:46.400 --> 36:48.288
is prepared to offer
time served,

36:48.340 --> 36:50.262
with six months' probation.

36:50.300 --> 36:52.268
Really?

36:52.310 --> 36:54.301
If you testify against Bishop.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.371
(sighs)

37:01.420 --> 37:02.478
(sniffs)

37:02.520 --> 37:04.579
I can't do that.
I understand.

37:04.620 --> 37:06.315
Then we're prepared to offer

37:06.350 --> 37:08.250
a lighter sentence
on the conspiracy charge.

37:08.290 --> 37:09.609
Four years.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.322
DIANE:
With tiane served?
0.

37:12.360 --> 37:16.023
With day-for-day good time,
that's two years in prison.

37:16.060 --> 37:18.369
That's the best you'll ever get.

37:20.370 --> 37:22.361

37:27.040 --> 37:29.008

Uh, I think I'm angry.
She's not
wrong, Cary.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.771
We go to jury, you
might get 15 years.

37:33.810 --> 37:36.813
That's seven and a
half in real time.

37:36.850 --> 37:39.387
Or you get out
when you're 37.

37:40.390 --> 37:44.429
It all comes crashing down.

37:44.460 --> 37:47.020
Cary, where are you going?
I need some air.

37:48.060 --> 37:50.255

DIANE:
I don't know. It's so hard.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.331
I can't imagine
being in his position.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.439
Where is he?

38:03.480 --> 38:05.778
Um, downstairs walking.

38:05.810 --> 38:07.072
I'm coming over.

38:07.110 --> 38:09.874
Yep. I think that would be good.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.081
What do you think he should do?

38:12.120 --> 38:13.883
Take the four years or fight?

38:13.920 --> 38:17.356
Yes.
(heavy sigh)

38:17.390 --> 38:19.927
I have no idea.

38:19.960 --> 38:23.452
Oh, did you really threaten
to knife

38:23.500 --> 38:26.094
your daughter's P.E. teacher?

38:26.130 --> 38:28.496

38:34.680 --> 38:35.829

Mrs. Florrick is

38:36.940 --> 38:38.441
a perfect parent.

She was joking
with her daughter, that's all.

38:40.980 --> 38:42.379
I want to be clear.

38:42.420 --> 38:45.082
We take school violence
seriously.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.985
But this was purely
a misunderstanding.

Offer patronage.

38:55.830 --> 38:57.388
I said I wouldn't do that.

38:57.430 --> 38:58.567
And you didn't.
You're saying

38:58.600 --> 38:59.828
that_ these teachers
just changed

38:59.870 --> 39:01.098
their mind?
Yeah. After getting seats

39:01.130 --> 39:02.768
on the Illinois
Safety Commission.

39:08.040 --> 39:11.077
Peter.
Yep. He had
some empty seats

39:11.110 --> 39:13.578
on a new commission
he formed.
So that's good--

39:13.610 --> 39:15.373
you didn't offer patronage.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.717
Yep.

39:16.750 --> 39:18.809
*

39:40.470 --> 39:43.633
*

39:46.450 --> 39:48.099
Cary.

39:48.150 --> 39:50.368
How are you?

39:51.790 --> 39:53.712
Hunlq-dory.

39:53.750 --> 39:55.650
Would you like to talk?

39:57.460 --> 39:59.849
Sure. Why not?

40:08.470 --> 40:11.439
You've been good, Cary.

40:11.470 --> 40:14.132
Thank you.

40:14.170 --> 40:16.673
I know what
you're up against.

40:16.710 --> 40:18.439
Four years.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.448
That's a hard one.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.778
Trial's not over yet.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.913
(sighs): Yeah.

40:24.950 --> 40:26.645
It is.

40:26.690 --> 40:29.750
They want you.

40:29.790 --> 40:32.156
They'll get you.

40:32.190 --> 40:34.750
I have a way to move you
out of the country.

40:34.800 --> 40:39.499
You won't be able to return,
but I'll get you an apartment.

40:39.530 --> 40:42.658
I need a legal consultant
in Europe.

40:42.700 --> 40:45.009
It'll be good pay.

40:45.040 --> 40:48.635
I'm not being
purely selfless.

40:48.680 --> 40:52.172
I need someone loyal
that can help me.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.173
Where would it be?

40:57.220 --> 40:59.541
Barcelona.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.581
What do you think?

41:04.560 --> 41:07.882
(sighs): Uh, I think
that I can't do that.

41:09.130 --> 41:11.098
Why?
The firm

41:11.130 --> 41:12.620
put up $1.3 million.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.763
I jump bail,
they don't get that back.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.735
So send them the money
from overseas.

41:17.770 --> 41:21.604
Don't go to jail for four years
because of a law firm.

41:27.180 --> 41:28.818
(bell dings)

41:36.660 --> 41:39.288
So...

41:39.330 --> 41:41.594
how's it going?

41:41.630 --> 41:44.292
Not good,
from the sound of things.

41:44.330 --> 41:45.695
Eh.

41:45.730 --> 41:47.527
Momentary setback.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.830
You got to fight it, Cary.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.245
(sighs): No.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.077
(chuckles):
No, I don't.

42:01.110 --> 42:02.816
Four years.

42:02.850 --> 42:05.614
Two years for good behavior.
And you didn't do it.

42:05.650 --> 42:06.742
I know.

42:06.790 --> 42:08.712
I'll be 37.
I can do that.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.819
I can't do 15 years.

42:10.860 --> 42:13.078
(whispers):
Dear Lord, Cary.
What are you gonna do?

42:13.130 --> 42:15.894
The choices have
been reduced.

42:15.930 --> 42:18.569
We can appeal.
I mean, you take the plea,

42:18.600 --> 42:20.568
you can't appeal.
Alicia...

42:20.600 --> 42:23.694
I have watched you long enough
with clients to know

42:23.740 --> 42:27.164
when you have a case
or when you don't.

42:27.210 --> 42:30.771
The smart deal here
is to take the plea.

42:39.690 --> 42:41.954
You'll come and see me?

42:45.760 --> 42:47.625
(crying):
I will.

42:47.660 --> 42:48.797
Good, good.

42:48.830 --> 42:51.958
I don't want to be lonely.

42:53.170 --> 42:55.161
(crying softly)

42:57.240 --> 43:00.767
CUESTA:
Would you like to revise
your plea, Mr. Agos?

43:06.680 --> 43:08.648
Yes, Your Honor.
I would like to plead guilty.
