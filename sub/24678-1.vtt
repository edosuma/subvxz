00:02.803 --> 00:06.478
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.507 --> 00:08.418
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.442 --> 00:09.978
These are their stories.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.636
Man: 68 East 74th. Here you go.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.302
I need some photo ID.

00:32.332 --> 00:35.370
You can have it back
when you return the plans.

00:35.402 --> 00:36.745
Cooper Union.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.307
- My daughter's thinking of applying.
- You like it?

00:39.339 --> 00:41.979
- Do you have a photocopier?
- 12th floor.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.647
Five cents a page.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.180
You need to have these back
by closing time today.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.690
Thanks, pal.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.358
Don't be stupid.

00:56.189 --> 00:58.032
Ah, ah, ah.

01:07.634 --> 01:10.114
Mikey? Jake.

01:10.137 --> 01:12.617
Oh, yeah. Yeah, what's up, man?

01:12.639 --> 01:14.448
I'm over this way.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.283
I'll take that from here.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.119
Hey, man, you got a fiver?

01:18.145 --> 01:19.783
All I got's Canadian.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.293
You know, for him.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.318
Forget that, man.

01:26.653 --> 01:29.156
Here you go. Come on.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.866
Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my fault.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.397
It's all right. You okay?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.341
Yeah, sure. Sorry.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.985
Meet Mr. Morris, Mr. Crane.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.319
- Everything okay, baby?
- Yeah.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.347
- Here, give me the wig.
- Hey, partner.

01:54.881 --> 01:57.191
- You up for some fun?
- All the time.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.689
Welcome to New York City.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.607
Put 'em on.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.301
Whoo!

02:13.000 --> 02:14.946
This is all right.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.805
Didn't I tell you I'd take care of you?

02:20.140 --> 02:22.279
Dress for success, yeah?

02:22.309 --> 02:24.289
Yeah.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.257
Okay, on to work.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.802
Here you go, Mr. Morris.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.836
If you would just sign where I circled here?

02:50.504 --> 02:53.348
It's space number three. The gray Cadillac.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.582
Here, let me get that for you, sir.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.522
Wow.

03:29.743 --> 03:33.782
A chimp could take better
pictures than Ansel Adams with this.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.293
I'll take it.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.488
Credit card and driver's license.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.644
( arm whirring )

05:03.436 --> 05:05.609
We're still under their radar.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.619
Time to leave New York, partner.

05:12.612 --> 05:13.852
(gunshot)

05:16.283 --> 05:17.762
Girl: Don't worry.

05:17.784 --> 05:20.424
They're not gonna be home until tomorrow.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.592
(giggling)

05:22.622 --> 05:24.966
Isn't this better than the dorm, huh?

05:26.126 --> 05:28.106
Man: Come here, I want you.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.937
Come on. My old room's here.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.102
- Where are you taking me?
- ( giggling )

05:32.132 --> 05:34.578
Girl: Oh my God!

05:34.601 --> 05:37.275
Hey! Take it easy. it's cool.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.716
Just take it easy.

05:39.739 --> 05:42.583
- Girl: No!
- ( stutters )

05:43.476 --> 05:45.285
This isn't good, man.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.451
- Man: Take it easy.
- What's the problem?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.892
- No, no. No, please!
- (screaming)

05:49.916 --> 05:51.793
Oh God! Oh God!

05:52.786 --> 05:54.459
(body thuds)

05:54.654 --> 05:56.497
Let's go!

06:12.606 --> 06:14.415
(theme music playing)

07:09.396 --> 07:11.307
Sergeant Finley? I'm Detective Eames,

07:11.331 --> 07:13.572
this is Detective Goren.
We're from Major Case.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.409
Tell us what you have here.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.006
The perps broke into this apartment
over the weekend.

07:18.038 --> 07:21.076
They dug through the sub-basement
to this jewelry store over here.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.748
We've got one body in the safe room.
One of the perps, looks like.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.917
We got two bodies in the apartment.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.951
College kids-- boy and a girl.
Wrong place, wrong time.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.930
- They live here?
- No, the girl's parents, the Kerstens.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.261
They're inside.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.528
So which crime scene you want to see first,

07:36.556 --> 07:39.264
the apartment or the jewelry store?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.965
The parents first.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.605
When did you get this letter?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.773
It came in the mail Monday.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.783
Sweepstakes winner.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.944
Weekend at Atlantic City.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.454
Limousine. Free accommodations.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.149
All expenses...

07:59.312 --> 08:01.314
This phone number here, did you call it?

08:01.348 --> 08:03.726
Yes, to confirm.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.354
A girl answered.

08:05.385 --> 08:08.855
She wished us luck at the casino.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.392
Damn them.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.404
Eames: Your daughter lived with you?

08:13.426 --> 08:17.238
No, no. Sophie was in a dorm at Columbia.

08:17.263 --> 08:19.743
She wanted to be independent, you know?

08:19.766 --> 08:23.737
We were so worried for her when she moved out.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.747
Mr. and Mrs. Kersten,

08:26.773 --> 08:30.118
I can't tell you how sorry we are
for what happened to your daughter.

08:30.143 --> 08:33.249
But we will find the people who did this.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.919
Your sergeant said they were professionals.

08:35.948 --> 08:39.020
The chances of you catching them...

08:41.554 --> 08:45.900
Mr. Kersten, I give you my word--

08:45.925 --> 08:48.098
we'll catch them.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.553
It's a nice thought, but how can
you make a promise like that?

09:05.578 --> 09:08.058
You don't get to do this for a bunch of rocks.

09:16.322 --> 09:19.064
Man: Over there were the Russians, 127 carats.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.901
D and E, white, flawless.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.237
There it was Canadian pieces, 78 carats,

09:23.263 --> 09:25.573
not the best quality for earrings.

09:25.598 --> 09:29.910
And here, uncut stones I'd just brought
back from London two weeks ago.

09:29.936 --> 09:32.416
One piece was 22 carats.

09:32.439 --> 09:36.478
- Altogether, 300, 350?
- Maybe. I cannot be sure.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.079
Well, let's call it $300 million.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.091
You can beef it up later for the insurance.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.421
I need a shot of his right hand.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.587
The genius who tapped into the security lines

09:43.616 --> 09:45.755
had to be working with two computers minimum,

09:45.785 --> 09:47.594
using custom software.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.930
- Here's your genius.
- How do you figure?

09:49.956 --> 09:51.936
There are fragments from the copper wiring

09:51.958 --> 09:53.938
embedded in the tips of his gloves.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.941
The question is, what did
he do to get himself shot?

09:56.963 --> 09:59.102
His buddies got greedy. Or he did.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.375
No, it's too personal for that.
I count four entry wounds in his skull.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.404
- Overkill.
- Do you notice his shoes?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.940
- Brand new.
- Same with the rest of his clothes.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.146
His jacket pockets are still sewn shut.

10:10.310 --> 10:14.190
He went out big-- $300 million. They're not
going to move that much merchandise overnight.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.626
We've got a week, assuming
they're still in the city.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.562
We'll put a description out to every
jurisdiction in the tri-state.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.293
It should be in NCIC by end of business.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.461
On the chance these cowboys have
some heavy hitters backing them,

10:24.491 --> 10:26.129
we brought OCCB into the loop.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.968
Make sure they stay two steps behind you.

10:27.994 --> 10:30.941
Get a workup on every known ice crew.
Their whys and wherefores.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.410
An established crew would
never leave one behind.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.970
Kid was an amateur.
Might've been worried he'd squawk.

10:36.002 --> 10:39.176
You wait, deal with that problem
somewhere else-- with one bullet.

10:39.205 --> 10:42.311
Whoever ran this show was impulsive.
Organized, but impulsive.

10:42.342 --> 10:46.119
I realize how unstimulating police procedure
can be for a right-brained guy like you,

10:46.146 --> 10:49.127
and I say this with all the respect
due a Detective First Grade--

10:49.149 --> 10:52.187
touch all the bases. What else?

10:52.218 --> 10:56.132
They probably had to pull blueprints, so
we'll check with the Building Department.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.399
We ran down the limo company that
took the Kerstens to Atlantic City.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.666
- We're waiting to hear back.
- Very nice, Alex.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.469
Give me a status at 2:00.

11:06.299 --> 11:09.280
East 74th. Here it is.

11:09.302 --> 11:12.112
Plans issued two weeks ago
to an Anna Hutchinson.

11:12.138 --> 11:15.119
- Did you get any ID?
- Student ID from Cooper Union.

11:15.141 --> 11:16.950
Oh, yeah. I remember her.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.956
What did she look like?

11:18.978 --> 11:20.958
Good looking young woman.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.620
Slim, dark hair-- shoulder-length,

11:23.650 --> 11:25.630
glasses, black rims-- you know,

11:25.652 --> 11:27.461
the art student look.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.627
What was her demeanor like,
the way she spoke-- friendly or not?

11:30.657 --> 11:33.467
Not. An honest to goodness ice queen.

11:33.493 --> 11:37.031
We'll need you to come down later
to talk to our sketch artist.

11:37.063 --> 11:41.842
Thanks. Using this girl, that's not
standard procedure for a burglary crew.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.439
- (cell phone ringing)
- It's most likely the boss' girlfriend.

11:44.504 --> 11:48.077
- Anybody else wouldn't be trusted.
- Eames. Put him through.

11:48.107 --> 11:51.816
Yes, this is Detective Eames. That's right.

11:51.844 --> 11:54.324
I'll need the card number.
Get back to me, please.

11:54.347 --> 11:58.591
Dispatcher from the limo company.
The car was ordered over the phone with a credit card.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.154
Name of Justin Crane.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.757
I used it to pay for groceries
at D'Agostino's.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.928
I was getting into my car
to go up to Vermont

12:04.958 --> 12:07.336
when some guy bumped into me-- some jogger.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.603
- He must've picked my pocket.
- What did this jogger look like?

12:10.630 --> 12:12.769
Blond hair-- long blond hair, sunglasses.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.278
I didn't get a good look at him.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.611
- Maybe your friend did.
- My friend?

12:17.637 --> 12:19.617
The ski reporter on the radio said

12:19.639 --> 12:21.778
it was bright and sunny up in Vermont.

12:21.808 --> 12:24.118
For someone who was outside all weekend,

12:24.143 --> 12:25.952
you look as pale as I do.

12:25.979 --> 12:29.756
Spending all that time indoors by
yourself wouldn't have been much fun.

12:29.782 --> 12:32.524
So can we talk to your friend?

12:36.022 --> 12:38.628
Long blond hair, right.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.468
We'd still like you to talk
to our sketch artist.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.667
We'll give you a call. Thank you.

12:44.831 --> 12:47.141
She didn't do any better than her boyfriend.

12:47.166 --> 12:50.636
- Cooper Union?
- No Anna Hutchinson on their student roster.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.480
Charges on Mr. Crane's
credit card since it was stolen.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.110
Our thief’s been living it up.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.485
Friday, $4,200 at Tourneau Watch,

12:57.510 --> 13:00.423
- $2,200 at Prada--
- That's John Doe's new clothes.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.222
He spent two grand on clothes
for a jewelry heist.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.593
New job, new clothes.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.599
Saturday, $300 at a camera store.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.601
More charges Sunday, today.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.762
You want to hit some of these places?

13:12.792 --> 13:16.604
Does it bother you that the same
people who just jacked $300 million

13:16.629 --> 13:19.269
- are maxing out a stolen credit card?
- Once a thief.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.279
You said yourself, they're impulsive.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.406
Okay, if it doesn't bother you.

13:25.204 --> 13:26.842
Man: That was good, baby.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.311
What did I tell you?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.458
Cut the attitude, eh?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.987
I got you off coke, I'll get you off those.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.162
That's good, partner.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.239
- Now what?
- Nothing.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.978
I want a steak.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.143
We don't have any.

14:00.173 --> 14:03.814
Well, the Palm's just 2 blocks away, honey.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.084
I'm sore. I can't walk.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.114
If you love me, you can walk.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.091
Yes. Mr. Crane. I remember the sale.

14:15.121 --> 14:18.261
He spent two minutes looking
at the camera and bang-- sold.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.271
- What did he look like?
- About six feet.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.603
Medium height. Red hair, short, mustache.

14:22.628 --> 14:25.632
- Tinted aviator glasses.
- Did he show you a driver's license?

14:25.665 --> 14:28.908
- Of course. We ask for one
with every purchase.
- Was anybody with him?

14:28.935 --> 14:31.211
- No.
- Did he know a lot about cameras?

14:31.237 --> 14:33.683
- ( pager beeping )
- He knew what he was looking for.

14:33.706 --> 14:37.051
- He asked for one with good low-light resolution.
- What did that tell you?

14:37.076 --> 14:38.987
Low light-- boudoir photos.

14:39.011 --> 14:42.959
90% of these instant cameras, people
buy them for intimate portraiture.

14:42.982 --> 14:45.622
- Man: Excuse me.
- Excuse me a second.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.962
We got a pop on the credit card.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.025
The 3-6 has a suspect in custody.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.202
Officer: Rise and shine, Sharif.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.801
Eames: He was using the
Justin Crane credit card?

14:59.832 --> 15:02.244
He was busted buying Metro cards
for his homeboys.

15:02.268 --> 15:05.306
- Where did you get the card?
- I told them a white dude gave it to me.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.808
- When?
- On Saturday, outside the
camera store on 23rd.

15:08.841 --> 15:12.186
- Goren: What'd he look like?
- Red like an apple. Red hair, red lip bush.

15:12.211 --> 15:15.385
- He just gave it to you?
- Yeah. I didn't know it was stolen.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.591
- He said, "Help yourself."
- Then what, he got in his sleigh
and rode off with his reindeer?

15:19.619 --> 15:21.599
No, just his big gray Caddie.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.032
Ho, ho, ho.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.934
That's him.

15:30.963 --> 15:32.772
This one from the kid.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.302
This from the camera salesman.

15:46.979 --> 15:48.981
See a family resemblance?

15:56.322 --> 15:57.858
These two could be this mutt.

15:57.890 --> 16:01.064
We had the witnesses look at mug books,
but nobody jumped out at them.

16:01.093 --> 16:04.802
- The gray Caddie?
- The kid remembered a couple numbers
from the license plate.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.572
- APB out.
- What am I looking at?

16:06.599 --> 16:08.738
Our John Doe-- the stiff from the crime scene.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.112
It's homemade. it could be a prison tattoo.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.549
How'd he get to prison
without his prints in the system?

16:13.573 --> 16:17.419
How'd my luggage end up in Amarillo last
Christmas? Where are we with matching MOS?

16:17.443 --> 16:21.414
- Doesn't fit any crackers in the database.
- Try a bigger database.

16:21.447 --> 16:23.859
Our boy is an extrovert.

16:23.883 --> 16:27.228
He's brazen, self-confident, charismatic.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.790
He imposes his girlfriend on the gang

16:29.822 --> 16:31.699
and he's holding them together

16:31.724 --> 16:35.103
even after killing one of them.

16:35.127 --> 16:39.075
We should look at armored
car heists, bank jobs,

16:39.098 --> 16:42.375
anything with public displays of firepower.

16:42.401 --> 16:45.712
Okay, we wasted time chasing down this
credit card. Let's make up for it.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.617
The jewelry store sent over
surveillance tapes for the last month.

16:48.641 --> 16:52.453
Our perps could be on there
casing the premises. Any volunteers?

17:54.307 --> 17:56.287
The ice queen?

17:56.309 --> 17:58.311
You notice anything unusual?

18:01.213 --> 18:03.159
Not really.

18:03.182 --> 18:06.288
It's just that she's putting
lipstick on her eyeball.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.292
She's taking a picture of the safe.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.716
Am I missing something?

18:30.743 --> 18:34.486
- I just like to watch.
- I like to listen.

18:34.513 --> 18:36.459
I'm meeting a snitch down at the Coronet.

19:14.920 --> 19:18.891
So if you have $300 million in
hot stones, who do you go to?

19:18.924 --> 19:22.497
Whoever gives you the best price.
Maybe you get 30¢ on the dollar.

19:22.528 --> 19:25.065
$100 million. Still a nice piece of change.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.373
- So who? The Russians?
- They don't need them.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.745
They're choking on diamonds
from the Kremlin vaults.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.909
Maybe the Chinese.

19:32.938 --> 19:35.077
This is hand-tooled, not machined.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.485
This X-brace was left welded to the safe.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.588
I might know a man in Brooklyn.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.754
- It's not one of mine.
- The question was, did you make it?

19:44.784 --> 19:47.765
- Your partner is deaf?
- Maybe you are.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.767
She asked you a yes or no question.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.268
Then the answer is no.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.770
Mr. De Santis, our crime lab can match

19:53.793 --> 19:55.773
the unique marks on this piece

19:55.795 --> 19:58.776
to the characteristics
on the tools you used to make it.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.438
Of course, we'd have to
confiscate all your equipment.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.469
Might take months to get it back.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.280
We'll take that as a yes. Who ordered it?

20:07.306 --> 20:10.446
Some guy. If I never saw him again,
it would be too soon.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.353
- Goren: His name?
- I don't know.

20:12.378 --> 20:15.359
Serbian? Croatian? A bald guy.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.588
There anything else?

20:17.616 --> 20:19.823
Yes-- you're closing early today.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.133
You got to think about this.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.793
Here we are, 15 years old,

20:24.824 --> 20:29.136
selling boomboxes to one of Big
Paulie's fences, and Danny's just--

20:29.161 --> 20:30.970
he's playing him.

20:30.996 --> 20:32.976
I'm telling you, your brother Danny,

20:32.998 --> 20:35.035
rest his soul, had big ones.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.509
Excuse me.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.318
I always had a thing for Gia.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.324
But never, out of respect for Danny--

20:47.346 --> 20:50.259
I admire your discipline.

20:52.351 --> 20:55.161
She mentioned you had a piece of business.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.827
- Not here, Jimmy.
- No. Sure.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.700
How big a piece?

21:03.129 --> 21:05.109
$100 million big.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.775
INS sent these over.

21:10.803 --> 21:14.114
Every man, woman and child who
entered the country in the last year

21:14.140 --> 21:15.949
with a passport from the Balkans.

21:15.975 --> 21:20.446
- And that's for the year before this.
- (phone ringing)

21:20.479 --> 21:23.119
Goren. That's right.

21:23.149 --> 21:26.153
What lot? Tell them to stay away from it.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.789
We'll be there in a half hour.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.458
Gray Caddie turned up.

21:29.488 --> 21:32.992
The car's a rental. We're waiting
for an ID on the driver.

21:36.328 --> 21:38.001
Pop the trunk.

21:58.350 --> 22:01.593
James Randazzo. it's a Bensonhurst address.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.600
Randazzo.

22:03.622 --> 22:04.828
There's a Jimmy Randazzo

22:04.857 --> 22:07.463
who's a soldier for the Masucci family.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.137
All that glitters.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.077
About 40 carats worth.

22:16.101 --> 22:18.479
Let's round up the usual Masuccis.

22:25.311 --> 22:27.621
I want a full court press on the Masuccis.

22:27.646 --> 22:30.092
Our informants have been
telling us the Randazzos

22:30.115 --> 22:33.619
have been on the outs with the
Masuccis since 3 months ago.

22:33.652 --> 22:35.632
Some dispute over liquor distribution.

22:35.654 --> 22:37.292
Now the dispute's over diamonds.

22:37.323 --> 22:38.802
This is not a mob thing.

22:38.824 --> 22:40.667
It's a sucker's game, Captain.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.536
This guy's just buying time.

22:42.561 --> 22:44.302
He's paying a big premium.

22:44.330 --> 22:48.073
There must have been, what, a million bucks
worth of stones in Randazzo's pocket?

22:48.100 --> 22:50.273
Lot of money just to send up some smoke.

22:52.338 --> 22:54.181
Goren, it's for you.

22:55.341 --> 22:58.345
- Friend of yours?
- I sure hope so.

23:04.250 --> 23:07.925
I showed Randazzo's diamonds to our jeweler.

23:07.953 --> 23:11.594
They were grade F --
slightly flawed, gray color.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.262
The worst rocks of the bunch.

23:13.292 --> 23:16.432
You were right. The Masucci
angle's a lot of smoke.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.772
This guy-- had enough he shoots 2 witnesses,

23:18.797 --> 23:22.108
now he throws a body in the trunk
just to throw us off his trail?

23:22.134 --> 23:25.274
Put yourself in his place. He is
trying to lock in a $100 million payday.

23:25.304 --> 23:27.284
Don't equivocate. He's a had guy.

23:27.306 --> 23:29.308
Bad guys do what good guys dream.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.953
I got a hit on our John Doe.

23:32.978 --> 23:35.288
I sent his prints up to Canada.

23:35.314 --> 23:38.454
- Michael Carson.
- That tattoo he had? Prison tattoo.

23:38.484 --> 23:41.761
A Canadian prison—
Archambault, up in Montreal.

23:41.787 --> 23:43.767
Carson spent two years in cell block D

23:43.789 --> 23:45.791
for possession with intent.

23:45.824 --> 23:48.202
That's why he was wearing new clothes.

23:48.227 --> 23:51.106
Whoever shot him didn't want his
old clothes traced back to Canada.

23:51.130 --> 23:55.408
- How did you...?
- The guy with the body art? He's got
biker friends up there.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.675
Carson's parole officer hasn't seen him

23:57.703 --> 24:00.149
since a week ago last Thursday.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.948
Meaning he came down here
Thursday night or Friday.

24:02.975 --> 24:06.889
Being a felon, he would've avoided
going through customs at the airport.

24:06.912 --> 24:09.984
That leaves the train,
where inspections are more lax.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.327
He would've arrived on
the train from Montreal

24:16.355 --> 24:19.097
last Thursday or Friday

24:19.124 --> 24:23.266
with luggage, computer
equipment, that sort of thing.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.775
Yeah, I seen this boy Friday afternoon.

24:25.798 --> 24:29.268
Helped him with his bags. Black canvas bags.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.248
He would have been a good tipper,
but he had this friend with him.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.911
- He was traveling with somebody?
- No, somebody met him.

24:34.940 --> 24:38.410
- You catch a name?
- Jake. Pretty sure it was Jake.

24:38.444 --> 24:39.684
Thank you.

24:44.249 --> 24:45.853
There he is.

24:50.489 --> 24:54.232
Jacob Nathan. Forgery, possession
of stolen goods, larceny--

24:54.259 --> 24:57.240
And tight with his money, too.

24:57.262 --> 24:59.742
- Where are we?
- We struck out on his last known.

24:59.765 --> 25:02.644
- He hasn't lived there for at least 2 years.
- We will, ma'am.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.579
His ex is looking for him, too.

25:04.603 --> 25:06.241
Owes her a brick in child support.

25:06.271 --> 25:07.807
This bail app from six years ago?

25:07.840 --> 25:10.286
His mother put up the bond.
There's an address on her.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.550
- Let me see that.
- Have her social there?

25:12.578 --> 25:16.151
The feebs have been notified.
They're taking care of Interpol notification.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.092
Give me a status in an hour.

25:18.117 --> 25:22.293
- Mother Nathan, deceased seven months ago.
- Poor guy's an orphan.

25:22.321 --> 25:24.597
Somebody forgot to tell Con Ed.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.796
The power bill's paid up and current.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.736
Come on, move it!

25:33.832 --> 25:35.869
Clear!

25:35.901 --> 25:37.608
Clear!

25:41.140 --> 25:42.813
Clear!

25:47.646 --> 25:51.253
- Check the trash rooms, the dumpsters.
- Yes, sir.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.320
Let's go, guys, move it!

26:21.613 --> 26:23.251
It's a laminating machine.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.922
Forger's friend. Nathan must
have left it behind.

26:25.951 --> 26:29.228
- Serial number's still on it.
- We could trace it to the store.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.824
I can't find it, man!

26:30.856 --> 26:32.927
I looked everywhere. Damn it, I'm a jerk.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.438
- I must have left it behind.
- Can't you get another one?

26:35.461 --> 26:38.442
I need it, man! I need it
to make the passports.

26:38.464 --> 26:41.104
Man: Don't even think about it.
Buy another one.

26:41.133 --> 26:44.239
I'm not spending another $500 bucks
on something I already bought.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.613
You listen to me, you cheap bastard.

26:46.638 --> 26:48.276
You go anywhere near that place,

26:48.307 --> 26:50.287
I'm gonna put a bullet in your skull.

26:50.309 --> 26:54.780
You got a quarter share of a $100 million
coming, you can front $500 bucks.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.293
All right, but when are we gonna
see our dough, man?

26:57.316 --> 27:01.321
- I gotta get out of here.
- I am working on the problem.
You work on yours!

27:11.230 --> 27:13.107
Hello?

27:16.602 --> 27:18.240
Can I help you?

27:18.270 --> 27:21.251
Yeah, I called about the
laminating machine. Name's Jake.

27:21.273 --> 27:24.083
Oh, yeah, sure. I got it in
the back. It's $549.

27:24.109 --> 27:26.487
I bought one here a month ago for $500.

27:26.512 --> 27:29.891
And now it's $549. Think about it.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.309
(grunts, groans)

27:58.143 --> 27:59.986
How you doing there, Jake?

28:05.083 --> 28:07.222
Death penalty? What the hell for?

28:07.252 --> 28:10.165
Do I need to explain the felony
murder statute to your client?

28:10.189 --> 28:12.066
I didn't kill anybody!

28:12.090 --> 28:13.899
The Kersten girl and her boyfriend.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.907
- Michael Carson, Jimmy Randazzo.
- That wasn't me.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.967
- And who the hell is Jimmy Randazzo?!
- Funny thing, the law.

28:19.998 --> 28:21.841
Right hand commits the murder,

28:21.867 --> 28:24.313
left hand pays for it.

28:24.336 --> 28:27.476
How can my client help himself here?

28:27.506 --> 28:29.247
Names and addresses,

28:29.274 --> 28:31.276
I take the death penalty off the table.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.290
Life without parole?

28:33.312 --> 28:36.191
That's pretty steep.
He's got no record of violence.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.592
He does now.

28:37.616 --> 28:39.425
And the offer's not going to hold.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.431
We found him, we'll find the others,

28:41.453 --> 28:43.933
with or without his help.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.935
Life, death,

28:47.960 --> 28:50.031
you choose.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.099
It's Atwood.

28:52.130 --> 28:53.734
It's Carl Atwood.

28:57.803 --> 28:59.942
The other guy I only know as Ziv.

28:59.972 --> 29:03.078
But he's the main guy, Atwood.
He's got the goods.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.579
- Where can we find him?
- I don't know.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.720
He lives on the Upper East Side
with his girlfriend.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.229
Her name is Gia... something Italian.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.562
I got a cell phone number on him.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.430
The number.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.939
Atwood and the girl, they been together long?

29:35.941 --> 29:37.921
Yeah, I think so.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.719
They got some act, those two.

29:40.746 --> 29:43.090
Carl Atwood, 38, priors for armed robbery,

29:43.115 --> 29:44.924
assault, home invasion robbery.

29:44.950 --> 29:48.659
Convictions in New York State,
Pennsylvania, Florida and Montreal.

29:48.687 --> 29:52.260
- Archambault prison?
- 18 months for attempted hijack
of an armored truck.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.761
- Same time-frame as Carson.
- Atwood was deported back here 6 months ago.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.604
- Thank you, Canada. What about the girl?
- Nothing in the file.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.770
- That cell phone number's cribbed.
- Carver: Can we use it to get Atwood?

30:01.800 --> 30:04.280
The phone company can
triangulate a call to the phone.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.647
- We'll need a warrant.
- I'll handle it.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.987
Hey, it's me. Passports are done.

30:14.012 --> 30:16.117
- Okay.
- They look good.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.059
So when's the deal goin’ down?

30:18.083 --> 30:20.962
Cell M67. East Side, north of 57th.

30:20.986 --> 30:25.093
East Side, north of 57th.

30:25.123 --> 30:28.297
Atwood: I said I'd page you.
What're you doing calling me?

30:28.327 --> 30:30.807
I'm watching Oprah and
eating Cheetos all day.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.901
- I just need to know how much longer.
- Atwood: Couple days.

30:33.932 --> 30:36.811
East 62nd, 100 block.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.872
Officer: East 62nd, Park and Lex.

30:40.605 --> 30:43.984
- Get off the phone.
- Wait, wait, wait.

30:44.009 --> 30:47.821
I need to know what birth date
to put on her passport?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.848
I thought you said they were done.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.297
Well, I need to know what birth date.

30:54.319 --> 30:56.321
136 East 62nd.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.232
136 East 62nd.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.466
Figure it out.

31:19.978 --> 31:21.787
These two, where do they live?

31:21.813 --> 31:23.656
12H.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.488
Eames: The place is empty.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.324
Check the stairwell and basement.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.330
- Stay here.
- Officer: Okay.

32:09.394 --> 32:11.931
Don't move. Up against the wall.

32:15.967 --> 32:17.947
He left you in the lurch, Gia.

32:17.969 --> 32:20.609
He left you to take the rap for 4 murders.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.448
That's a needle in your arm.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.454
You're letting him run?

32:24.476 --> 32:26.547
You didn't run, did you,

32:26.578 --> 32:30.116
when he was in prison up in Montreal?

32:30.148 --> 32:32.321
In prison with Michael Carson.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.163
(knocking at door)

32:39.658 --> 32:42.639
- The autopsies just came in.
- Thanks.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.980
Sophie Kersten.

32:51.002 --> 32:53.812
The daughter of the people
who lived in the apartment.

32:53.839 --> 32:55.318
19 years old.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.820
Your boyfriend put a bullet in her brain.

32:57.843 --> 33:00.585
This is her boyfriend.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.491
We think we was shot
while trying to protect her.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.359
That's what boyfriends are supposed to do.

33:08.286 --> 33:10.129
Michael Carson.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.738
The Medical Examiner found...

33:15.760 --> 33:17.933
Evidence of frequent anal sex.

33:28.139 --> 33:33.646
This is Atwood's preferred
sexual act... isn't it?

33:38.650 --> 33:41.756
It's his way of dominating his partner.

33:59.170 --> 34:01.275
Have you been tested for AIDS?

34:03.608 --> 34:05.281
Why should I?

34:06.344 --> 34:08.755
Michael Carson was HIV positive.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.760
According to this, for at least a year.

34:10.782 --> 34:13.284
During time he and Atwood
were having relations.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.297
That's not true.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.965
Page four.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.467
Would you like to get tested?

34:32.103 --> 34:34.811
You are aware they had a sexual relationship?

34:43.148 --> 34:45.286
Your boyfriend was in prison

34:45.317 --> 34:47.319
a relatively short time...

34:49.154 --> 34:51.793
But he couldn't control his sexual needs.

34:51.822 --> 34:53.928
You blamed yourself, didn't you?

34:55.994 --> 34:59.874
That you couldn't hold
onto his loyalty and desire

34:59.898 --> 35:01.468
for 18 months.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.279
If I'm wrong in my evaluation,
Ms. DeLuca, please tell me.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.952
He's betrayed you before, hasn't he?

35:13.278 --> 35:16.088
But he always came back.
And you told yourself

35:16.114 --> 35:18.958
it was because you're the one he loves.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.961
But he's never told you
that he loved you, has he?

35:25.290 --> 35:27.770
Not in a way that would make you believe him.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.439
He makes demands on you.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.604
Demands during lovemaking.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.443
Demands that leave you unsatisfied.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.880
And you always submit,

35:38.903 --> 35:41.816
which for that reason he
trusts you completely.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.083
You submit...

35:49.114 --> 35:54.086
Because you hope to earn his love and loyalty.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.967
Those hopes can only remain unfulfilled,

35:57.989 --> 35:59.969
because Carl Atwood

35:59.991 --> 36:01.902
is a narcissist.

36:01.926 --> 36:05.032
He's incapable of loving you...

36:05.063 --> 36:06.440
Or anyone else.

36:07.432 --> 36:11.380
He seeks out partners to satisfy his needs.

36:12.437 --> 36:14.917
Ms. DeLuca, I have to be honest with you.

36:14.939 --> 36:18.113
There's virtually no chance
that you're not infected.

36:19.611 --> 36:23.423
People with AIDS rarely survive
long prison sentences.

36:23.448 --> 36:26.759
The treatments in a maximum
security prison are limited.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.924
But if you cooperate with us,

36:28.953 --> 36:32.867
we can take steps to improve
your long-term outlook.

36:36.127 --> 36:38.733
You have given him everything...

36:42.967 --> 36:46.710
And this is how he repaid you.

36:54.312 --> 36:56.314
This is Ms. DeLuca's attorney.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.992
I want to talk to her alone.

37:06.591 --> 37:09.834
- Deakins: AIDS, tough break.
- Tougher if it was true.

37:11.262 --> 37:12.969
You think she believed it?

37:12.997 --> 37:16.137
We better come up with
another way of finding Atwood.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.545
We searched the apartment, her purse--

37:18.570 --> 37:20.572
no leads to him or the merchandise.

37:20.605 --> 37:22.414
What about the other one, the Serbian?

37:22.440 --> 37:24.579
Casten Zivkovic. He’s overstayed his visa,

37:24.609 --> 37:26.589
along with a million other
people we can't find.

37:26.611 --> 37:29.091
Deakins: Release his and
Atwood's picture to the media.

37:29.114 --> 37:31.185
Put some pressure on them, hope they slip up.

37:31.216 --> 37:32.524
We got her.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.797
That's her blink.

37:43.294 --> 37:46.104
You get in any trouble, you call me.

37:46.131 --> 37:48.634
Gia, you're not out of the woods yet!

37:54.305 --> 37:57.286
- You released her?
- We made a deal with her.

37:57.308 --> 37:59.219
She gives us Atwood and the diamonds,

37:59.277 --> 38:02.349
she gets 5 years minimum security
with full medical treatment.

38:02.380 --> 38:08.058
- What's wrong with her?
- Detective Goren convinced her
Atwood gave her AIDS.

38:08.086 --> 38:11.556
- That's how we flipped her.
- But you have her under surveillance.

38:11.589 --> 38:14.729
No. She'll contact us.

38:14.759 --> 38:17.899
It was the only way we
could get her to cooperate.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.636
She won't run, Ms. Lewin.

38:21.766 --> 38:23.507
Do you trust his judgment?

38:24.769 --> 38:27.375
On this, yes, I do.

38:27.405 --> 38:29.009
Should I trust yours?

39:32.937 --> 39:35.213
54th between 6th and 7th.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.318
- They didn't plant nothing on me.
- Shut up.

39:42.347 --> 39:45.692
Stupid enough to get pinched, stupid
enough to let them put a signal on you.

39:45.717 --> 39:49.756
What are they waiting for? Baby, trust me.

39:49.787 --> 39:51.767
They let you go, you bitch.

39:51.789 --> 39:53.598
What'd you do, get on your knees

39:53.625 --> 39:54.933
and give them a hummer, huh?

39:54.959 --> 39:56.939
I told them what they wanted to hear.

39:56.961 --> 39:59.168
It doesn't matter. It got me here with you.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.169
They're police. They set you up.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.306
They tried-- they tried
to mess with my head.

40:05.336 --> 40:08.180
They told me that Carson's got AIDS...

40:08.206 --> 40:11.483
And that you got the bug from him
and that you gave it to me.

40:11.509 --> 40:14.149
They think I bought it but I didn't.

40:14.178 --> 40:16.454
I should get out now.

40:16.481 --> 40:19.985
- I should leave you right here and get out.
- Don't be like that, baby.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.857
No.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.103
Whatever you want...

40:28.126 --> 40:29.833
I'll do it.

40:30.828 --> 40:32.535
Come here.

40:32.563 --> 40:34.008
You say you don't believe them?

40:36.034 --> 40:37.775
Prove it.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.045
Come on, baby.

40:48.713 --> 40:50.283
Come on.

40:53.351 --> 40:56.093
(phone rings)

40:56.120 --> 40:58.930
Yeah?

40:58.957 --> 41:01.028
They'll be here in 15 minutes.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.567
Banco Nazionale.

41:36.594 --> 41:39.700
That's got to be more money
than that whole country's worth.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.972
Your turn.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.851
The furthest south I've ever been is Cancun.

41:49.874 --> 41:52.218
I found some damned lizards
in my hotel room.

41:52.243 --> 41:55.417
Maid said they were good luck.
Must've worked...

41:55.446 --> 41:58.188
'cause if this isn't luck,

41:58.216 --> 42:00.321
I don't know what is.

42:06.557 --> 42:09.936
I may not spend all this money in
my lifetime, but I'm going to try--

42:10.928 --> 42:12.669
Drop the gun and the bag. Drop it!

42:14.165 --> 42:15.735
You're under arrest, Atwood.

42:15.767 --> 42:18.543
- You have the right to remain --
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:18.569 --> 42:21.311
- You stupid bitch.
- We're both dead anyway.

42:21.339 --> 42:23.250
You killed us.

42:24.809 --> 42:27.847
Think again, Gia. You got a long
and healthy life ahead of you.

42:29.781 --> 42:32.227
I lied. Sorry.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.171
Let's go.

42:53.938 --> 42:57.147
Once she got her hands
on this, why she didn't run--

42:57.175 --> 42:59.280
It wasn't about that. It was about him.

42:59.310 --> 43:01.517
Men come and go, but diamonds--

43:01.546 --> 43:03.651
Diamonds don't keep you warm at night.

43:13.091 --> 43:14.934
