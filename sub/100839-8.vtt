WEBVTT

00:20.729 --> 00:21.688
[swallows]

00:24.024 --> 00:24.858
Hey.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.819
I was looking all over for you.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.572
How long ago did you leave the vigil?

00:30.655 --> 00:32.032
Not long ago enough.

00:32.532 --> 00:33.700
Okay.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.369
Well, that's a nice jacket.

00:36.828 --> 00:37.912
Oh, shit, it's...

00:37.996 --> 00:40.957
It's Ben's. He gave it to me,
and I forgot to give it back to him.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.751
Oh, what else did he give you?

00:45.003 --> 00:45.837
What are you talking about?

00:45.920 --> 00:47.589
What are you talking about?

00:47.672 --> 00:50.175
Okay, uh, you know what?

00:50.258 --> 00:54.012
I'm really exhausted, and I think
that you are on the dark side of drunk.

00:54.095 --> 00:57.015
I think I'm on the dark side of the truth.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.225
Okay, I don't know what that means.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.810
-Look, let's just--
-Think about it.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.063
I can't. It doesn't make any sense.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.898
So let's just...
Why don't we call it a night?

01:04.981 --> 01:08.234
I need two minutes where I don't feel like
the fucking walls are caving in on me.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.237
-All right, so let's--
-Why did you have Steve Wood's car?

01:12.614 --> 01:13.615
Uh...

01:16.159 --> 01:17.577
'Cause...

01:17.660 --> 01:19.662
[theme music playing]

01:22.957 --> 01:24.125
So he just gave it to you?

01:24.209 --> 01:25.543
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.505
Who just gives someone
an $80,000 Mercedes?

01:28.588 --> 01:31.633
That is a great follow-up question,
and I will answer it.

01:31.716 --> 01:32.759
The answer is...

01:33.301 --> 01:36.554
I was about to close a really big deal
with Steve,

01:36.638 --> 01:39.140
and he pulled out last minute,

01:39.224 --> 01:41.392
so, uh... he felt bad.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.310
Yeah, super bad.

01:42.393 --> 01:46.689
Yeah, so he gave me the car as, like,
an apology for bailing on out.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.233
[Judy] He's really, really generous.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.569
-Then he goes missing... [sighs]
-[groans]

01:51.694 --> 01:54.072
...and we hadn't switched over the title.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.617
So I put it into storage

01:57.951 --> 02:00.620
until that whole thing plays out,
which could be--

02:00.703 --> 02:02.372
[both] Many, many years.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.624
-And many never even happen.
-No.

02:04.707 --> 02:06.167
Well, how did it get burned?

02:06.835 --> 02:08.586
Well, it wouldn't start,

02:08.670 --> 02:10.713
and then your mom left it
on the side of the road.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.298
Yeah, 'cause I thought it'd be fine.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.884
You know how people love
to burn cars on the side of the road.

02:14.968 --> 02:15.969
Not really.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.972
Yeah, really. People are a fucking mess.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.057
-Yeah. Sad.
-[sighs]

02:21.599 --> 02:23.017
Well, then shouldn't we go to the police?

02:23.101 --> 02:25.895
Right? At least tell them that Steve
wasn't the one driving the car that night?

02:26.813 --> 02:28.273
That's the right thing to do, right?

02:28.356 --> 02:30.483
-Eh, I mean, I'd--
-[Charlie] Or no?

02:30.567 --> 02:33.361
-Hey, I'd love to do the right thing.
-Me too.

02:33.444 --> 02:36.030
Um, but, kiddo,

02:36.698 --> 02:37.866
we go to the cops,

02:38.491 --> 02:39.951
we're gonna have to tell them

02:40.034 --> 02:41.494
that you were driving the car,

02:41.578 --> 02:43.788
and you would get into a lot of trouble,

02:43.872 --> 02:46.124
and you would never, ever

02:46.207 --> 02:48.918
-get your license, so... [inhales]
-No.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.336
You're right.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.714
-[Charlie] Oh, fuck.
-Yeah.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.424
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

02:55.717 --> 02:56.843
I'm sorry.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.929
Aww, baby, baby, no, I know.
I know. I'm sorry.

03:00.013 --> 03:00.930
-I'm sorry.
-Me, too.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.516
-But it's like, it's okay.
-It is.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.726
We fuck up, you know?

03:04.809 --> 03:08.771
-We all fuck up. Mm-hmm.
-Everybody, a lot of times.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.982
Okay, well...

03:11.482 --> 03:12.317
[Jen] Yeah.

03:12.775 --> 03:15.862
Just don't take it all on you,
you know what I mean?

03:15.945 --> 03:17.363
-On your shoulders. Night, babe.
-[Judy] No.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.406
-Sleep tight.
-[Charlie] Good night.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.243
-Oh, my God, I'm gaslighting my own kid.
-[Charlie] Oh!

03:22.410 --> 03:25.705
I'm lying to him.
I'm lying to everyone all the time.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.333
Okay, but you know what?
You don't have to lie to me.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.585
-Okay?
-Hmm?

03:31.085 --> 03:32.670
I saw you kissing Ben, okay?

03:33.796 --> 03:34.714
[swallows]

03:35.673 --> 03:38.176
[stammers] That was-- he kissed me.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.802
It meant nothing.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.763
Okay, but it seems a little unfair to me

03:41.846 --> 03:43.514
since you told me I can't date Michelle

03:43.598 --> 03:44.933
because of the proximity to Perez,

03:45.016 --> 03:47.310
but then you can just
mack out all you want with Ben.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.063
Okay, well, I'm not gonna be
"macking out" with him ever again.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.231
Well, that's too bad,

03:51.773 --> 03:54.525
because in a normal world,
you guys would make a really good couple.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.946
Well, we don't live in a normal world.
[scoffs]

03:58.613 --> 03:59.489
Not anymore.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.158
And it's Ben.

04:02.533 --> 04:03.952
It's Steve's fucking brother.

04:04.035 --> 04:07.205
It's Steve's fucking sweet brother. Okay?

04:07.872 --> 04:10.375
Hey, you know what?
Crazier things have happened.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.835
No, literally they have not.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.257
Look, he's coming in the morning
to look at some rentals,

04:17.340 --> 04:19.676
and I'm gonna tell him that
that was a mistake,

04:19.759 --> 04:21.511
and I can't work with him anymore.

04:21.594 --> 04:22.428
If it didn't mean anything,

04:22.512 --> 04:25.306
-why can't you work with him anymore?
-Look, I don't want Ben.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.557
I don't want anyone.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.726
I'm, like, done with all of that.

04:29.978 --> 04:30.895
Well, I'm not.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.816
And what? We're just never supposed
to be happy again?

04:35.608 --> 04:36.526
Just because we...

04:37.485 --> 04:38.945
did some bad things,

04:39.404 --> 04:40.780
we don't deserve love?

04:42.031 --> 04:45.201
[sobbing]

04:46.995 --> 04:48.955
[sobbing]

04:52.250 --> 04:53.084
You do.

04:54.002 --> 04:54.961
You deserve love.

04:56.212 --> 04:57.588
-So do you.
-No...

04:57.672 --> 04:59.340
Oh, God, I don't know about that.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.258
I do.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.886
Look, if you want to be with Michelle...

05:04.721 --> 05:06.055
I can't stand in your way.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.350
I want you to have whatever you want.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.520
Okay? Just...

05:12.895 --> 05:15.231
stay out of Perez's way.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.149
Okay?

05:16.232 --> 05:18.359
-Okay.
-Don't get all confessy.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.404
I'm gonna be so careful.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.031
-Okay.
-Okay.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.243
-I love you.
-I love you too.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.625
Seriously, don't say anything.

05:35.126 --> 05:35.960
-Okay.
-Okay?

05:36.044 --> 05:38.046
'Cause you can get very leaky
out your mouth.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.839
I'm not gonna get leaky.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.632
-Thank you.
-Okay.

05:42.133 --> 05:42.967
You're drunk.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.887
Just a little bit now.
That sobered me up a little.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.805
-You did. You kind of pulled it together.
-Thank you.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.266
-[telephone rings]
-[sighs]

05:50.600 --> 05:51.809
Steve Wood tip line.

05:53.102 --> 05:53.936
Ma'am...

05:54.604 --> 05:55.480
Yeah.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.690
Ma'am, I can't hear a word you're saying.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.234
I need you to step away
from the garbage disposal, please.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.236
Yeah-- Yeah, it's the garbage--

06:02.320 --> 06:07.033
-My man.
-Oh. Chief Hastings. Hi.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.535
How's it going?

06:10.203 --> 06:12.372
-[clears throat]
-Any solid leads?

06:13.414 --> 06:15.541
Uh, define "solid."

06:16.125 --> 06:19.045
I mean, having a guy go missing
with an identical twin walking around

06:19.128 --> 06:22.215
present its own, uh... challenges.

06:22.298 --> 06:26.511
Well, if you're not up for the challenge,
I could put someone else on this, Prager.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.263
I didn't say that. Uh...

06:29.389 --> 06:32.892
I'm just saying,
this reward thing, it's tricky.

06:32.975 --> 06:35.686
$100,000, it makes people see
what they wanna see.

06:35.978 --> 06:40.733
Well, what I wanna see is some justice
for Steve Wood.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.945
-He's a good guy from a good family.
-Hmm.

06:44.028 --> 06:47.949
Then why is the FBI investigating him
for money laundering?

06:48.032 --> 06:48.950
A better question is,

06:49.033 --> 06:52.203
why did his ex-fiancée turn him in
and then drain his bank account?

06:52.286 --> 06:55.373
Oh, that's another question,
not sure if it's better. [scoffs]

06:55.456 --> 06:56.290
It's better.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.586
Judy Hale is a bitter,
conniving grifter out for money,

07:00.670 --> 07:02.755
and my hunch says revenge.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.090
Really?

07:04.507 --> 07:08.219
You think an arts-and-crafts teacher
for old folks is a better suspect

07:08.302 --> 07:10.304
than the Greek Mafia he's working for?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.516
[laughing]

07:15.560 --> 07:17.603
[laughs] The Greek Mafia.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.896
Uh-huh.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.567
-[slurps]
-[Hastings laughing]

07:22.650 --> 07:23.484
Prager...

07:24.652 --> 07:26.571
you're not starting to lose it again,
are you?

07:27.572 --> 07:28.531
Tsk.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.825
-[telephone rings]
-Hmm.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.619
Answer the phone, bro.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.496
I'm starting to worry about you.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.331
[rings]

07:37.415 --> 07:39.292
I'm not your bro, homie.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.463
Steve Wood tip line.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.217
You saw him on horseback. Huh.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.345
What kind of horse?

08:04.567 --> 08:05.693
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:05.818 --> 08:06.694
Hi.

08:06.777 --> 08:10.156
I tried to call, but then I was like,
this is an in-person thing.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.449
Have you been drinking?

08:11.532 --> 08:12.366
Sure.

08:12.909 --> 08:13.993
Did I wake you?

08:14.076 --> 08:15.036
You did.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.120
Oh.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.581
I just want to tell you
that I can't stop thinking about you.

08:19.040 --> 08:19.874
Hmm.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.585
And that I'm sorry that I acted stupid
and weird yesterday,

08:22.668 --> 08:24.754
and that I just shouldn't have
pushed you away.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.050
[sighs] Judy, this is, uh...

08:31.761 --> 08:34.931
Look, I think you need to maybe
take a beat,

08:35.640 --> 08:36.641
sober on up,

08:36.724 --> 08:39.936
and, uh, just think about
what you really want.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.646
No, I know what I really want.

08:41.729 --> 08:42.563
Do you?

08:43.439 --> 08:44.565
I like you, Michelle.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.943
Like, I <i>like you</i> like you.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.655
Like, I wanted to come with a boom box
over my head like in <i>Say Anything,</i>

08:50.738 --> 08:52.907
but I know that that's played out, so...

08:53.407 --> 08:55.785
Yeah, it's totally played out,
but I would have liked it.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.328
Shit! I can come back.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.247
No, I get the sentiment.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.750
I just think you are so smart

09:02.833 --> 09:05.503
and funny and beautiful and sexy and...

09:06.420 --> 09:08.881
your food is amazing...

09:10.299 --> 09:13.135
and your eyes are delicious,

09:13.219 --> 09:16.722
and I just really want to kiss you
right now if you'll let me.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.822
Is your roommate home?

09:33.489 --> 09:35.533
-She's on the night shift.
<i>-</i>Oh, great.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.455
[doorbell rings]

09:45.918 --> 09:46.919
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.131
Um, these are for you.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.883
Oh, thank you. Um...

09:52.967 --> 09:55.261
-You really didn't have to--
-Oh, they're from my mom...

09:55.344 --> 09:58.014
um, to say thank you for the vigil.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.932
She's very grateful, and me, too. I'm...

10:00.850 --> 10:02.184
very grateful, and so is she.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.978
Well, it's the least I could do.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.648
Oh, before I forget, your jacket.

10:08.524 --> 10:11.527
-Um, here you go. [sighs]
-Thanks.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.486
Um...

10:14.905 --> 10:17.700
I guess we should probably talk
about what happened last night.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.287
Oh, no. What, um...
What-- what did I do?

10:21.370 --> 10:22.955
Did I say something stupid?

10:23.039 --> 10:26.042
Oh, you don't remember?

10:26.125 --> 10:28.544
I-- I was really drunk.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.713
It was kind of a blackout situation.

10:32.089 --> 10:32.923
Uh...

10:33.424 --> 10:35.259
Oh, no. Tell me I didn't do anything dumb.

10:37.678 --> 10:40.181
-No, no, you didn't.
-[sighs]

10:41.599 --> 10:44.727
It's just,
I saw that you were drinking and--

10:44.810 --> 10:47.647
Yeah, yeah, um... [sighs, laughs]

10:47.730 --> 10:50.775
I mean, no judgment.
I just... was just concerned.

10:51.984 --> 10:52.818
Thanks.

10:54.111 --> 10:55.905
A week ago, I was a year sober.

10:55.988 --> 10:56.864
Mm-hmm.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.533
[groans] Woke up this morning,

10:59.617 --> 11:02.536
and I had one of those mirror moments

11:02.620 --> 11:06.332
where you just kind of want
to erase everything you see.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.377
Don't relate to that at all. [scoffs]

11:09.460 --> 11:10.461
[chuckles]

11:10.753 --> 11:13.756
Um, listen, actually,

11:13.839 --> 11:16.884
I don't think
I can really help you anymore.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.387
Just the rental market is dead, and...

11:19.470 --> 11:21.222
How's the buyer's market?

11:22.348 --> 11:23.516
[stuttering] Why?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.435
Are you moving here permanently?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.771
No, um, but...

11:28.854 --> 11:32.566
it's looking like my parents have to sell,
because of Steve.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.861
-Oh.
-It's a long story. I can't get into it,

11:35.945 --> 11:38.489
-or I'll immediately start drinking again.
-Don't do that.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.741
Um, but my mother was so taken with you,

11:40.825 --> 11:44.203
that she wants you to be her realtor.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.289
Oh, well, that's so nice.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.667
But, um, yeah, I can't take that on.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.919
Yeah, well, she wants someone
that she can trust,

11:52.002 --> 11:54.255
and, you know, who she knows
is gonna look out for them.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.549
Yeah, I know, it's just,
in my life right now--

11:56.632 --> 12:00.511
I mean, the house has gotta be worth
at least 10 to 15 mil.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.638
-Sorry to say "mil." That's icky.
-Yeah.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.849
But if anyone should get that commission,

12:05.391 --> 12:06.767
I mean, it's you.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.065
I mean, I could take a look at it.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.290
[Judy] Hi, Hazel.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.007
Flo?

12:47.391 --> 12:51.187
Then in the early '80s,
we ripped up most of the marble floors

12:51.270 --> 12:53.272
because it was slippery.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.608
-Oh, so slippery. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm. Flashy.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.109
Of course.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.528
I didn't need my home to be a showcase.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.156
I wanted it to be a safe space
for my children.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.783
-[Jen] Mm-hmm.
-It was, Mom.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.118
No, it's a great place for kids.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.328
Oh, thank you.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.582
And thank you again
for what you did for us yesterday

13:11.999 --> 13:13.709
with that beautiful vigil.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.336
Oh, it was nothing.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.087
It was everything.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.965
You gave us hope,

13:20.424 --> 13:23.135
just when things seemed the darkest.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.597
When Steven gets home,

13:26.722 --> 13:28.766
I'm going to make sure
he thanks you properly.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.436
That's uh-- Thank you.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.441
-Benji, I'll let you finish the tour.
-Okay.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.152
I need to rest my knees. I'm...

13:41.028 --> 13:43.155
bone on bone. Hmm.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.910
-Careful on the stairs, Mom.
-Mm-hmm. I'll take them one at a time.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.497
-She'll take them one at a time.
-Hmm.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.626
-Are you okay?
-Hmm?

13:55.709 --> 13:57.044
Yeah, no, no, it's just...

13:57.711 --> 13:58.963
Just a lot to take in.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.048
Yeah. Subtle, right?

14:01.507 --> 14:03.467
-Yeah.
-And the tour's just getting started.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.844
Oh.

14:04.927 --> 14:08.347
You know, you don't need to...
I can show myself around.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.266
Oh, actually you can't. [laughs]

14:10.349 --> 14:11.851
People do get lost here.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.563
I don't want to end up finding
your dusty skeleton in the maid's chamber

14:15.855 --> 14:16.730
ten years from now.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.983
I'm gonna pretend
you did not say "maid's chamber."

14:19.066 --> 14:20.526
Me, too. [laughs]

14:21.026 --> 14:22.570
Uh, this is the sitting room,

14:22.653 --> 14:25.614
where you can see my mother's love
of tassels on full display.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.493
Oh, um, don't look at that.

14:29.618 --> 14:32.121
[chuckles]
Uh, that's not part of the tour.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.080
Oh.

14:33.205 --> 14:36.584
Yeah, that's eight-year-old me
wearing a turtleneck at the beach.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.335
Hmm. What, were you cold?

14:39.211 --> 14:40.546
No, quite the opposite.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.715
It was a very hot summer. [laughs]

14:42.798 --> 14:45.301
No, it was because of the surgeries.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.553
I had scars, and Steve didn't.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.306
And I wanted all the girls to like me,
so I...

14:50.764 --> 14:53.559
I thought, why advertise all that?

14:53.976 --> 14:56.145
You know?
But they didn't like me anyway, so...

14:56.228 --> 14:57.438
Come on, yeah, they did.

14:58.188 --> 15:01.817
No. Believe it or not, hospital boy
whose best friend was a nurse

15:01.901 --> 15:03.986
wasn't exactly bringing
all the girls to the yard.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.154
Oh, fuck those girls.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.156
They don't deserve you.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.575
'Cause I...

15:11.201 --> 15:15.039
I think that scars show that
you went through something hard,

15:15.122 --> 15:16.123
and you survived.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.460
And it's your story.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.087
I like that.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.048
Just how I look at it.

15:25.883 --> 15:26.717
Yeah.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.390
Is that an elephant made out of ivory?

15:33.474 --> 15:35.601
-And we're walking.
-'Cause that's fucked up.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.603
-[Ben clears throat]
-Interesting.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.740
Hi, I'm looking for a Flo Gutierrez.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.119
I mean, I think her first name
is actually Flora.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.079
Are you family?

15:55.162 --> 15:57.623
-No, but I'm--
-ICU is family only. Sorry.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.335
Right. Thanks. [clears throat]

16:22.773 --> 16:23.941
[Judy gasps]

16:24.858 --> 16:26.235
Hey, Michelle.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.445
-Judy. What are you doing here?
-Hey.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.656
Hey. I came as soon as I heard.

16:30.739 --> 16:31.782
Is she okay?

16:32.241 --> 16:35.035
[exhales] I don't know. She, um...

16:36.203 --> 16:39.081
She had a stroke,
and they're, uh, doing some tests.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.334
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Can I do anything?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.503
No. Thank you. You don't...

16:45.004 --> 16:46.130
You didn't even have to come.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.214
Well, I know that, but--

16:47.297 --> 16:49.216
Jesus Christ, it won't go away.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.301
You're not allowed to be back here.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.388
Ana, could you stop being a cop
for two seconds, please?

16:54.471 --> 16:55.347
No.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.975
Have you not heard a word I've said
about her?

16:58.058 --> 16:59.059
[Michelle] Yes, I did.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.103
She's a riptide,
whatever the fuck that means.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.982
It's a metaphor,
but allow me to spell it out for you.

17:05.065 --> 17:08.193
At best, she's an unstable accused stalker

17:08.277 --> 17:10.696
who I have personally arrested
for destruction of property.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.114
It wasn't a stalk, more of a follow,

17:12.197 --> 17:13.365
and the property was that car--

17:13.449 --> 17:16.285
At worst,
she's involved in an active investigation

17:16.368 --> 17:20.164
where her ex-fiancé is currently missing
and possibly dead.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.333
-What?
-Yeah.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.545
So forgive me for being protective,

17:26.628 --> 17:28.630
because I don't want you
to end up like him.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.134
Is that true?

17:32.676 --> 17:34.595
I, um...

17:35.679 --> 17:36.513
I mean...

17:37.681 --> 17:39.725
Technically, he is missing.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.352
But I, um...

17:43.145 --> 17:44.271
You know what, I...

17:45.981 --> 17:48.275
I can't deal with this right now.
There's-- [sighs]

17:48.358 --> 17:49.359
This is too much.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.153
I'm so sorry.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.946
-I just want to be with my mom.
-Okay.

17:53.030 --> 17:53.906
Alone.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.075
-Oh-- Michelle.
-Don't.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.496
[sighs]

18:03.999 --> 18:06.210
I'll just... go this way.

18:25.896 --> 18:31.276
Listen, I know that you have been
making an effort to do the right thing

18:31.360 --> 18:33.237
and to be a better person,

18:33.320 --> 18:36.824
and I just want you to know that

18:37.491 --> 18:38.450
I see you.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.327
Okay.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.995
I see you too.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.456
No, like, the inner you.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.292
Anyway, my work has been picking up,

18:47.376 --> 18:49.711
and what I'm saying

18:49.795 --> 18:52.589
is that if you keep
on the right path here,

18:53.340 --> 18:56.593
there may be a car in your future.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.762
-Really?
-Mm-hmm. Yep.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.390
Good behavior pays off, bud.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.432
[chuckles]

19:03.433 --> 19:04.268
[huffs]

19:06.603 --> 19:07.729
-What the fuck?
-Hmm?

19:35.716 --> 19:36.800
All right, go inside.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.344
See if we have any paint.

19:46.602 --> 19:47.811
Karen!

19:51.440 --> 19:52.316
-Jeff.
-Jen.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.734
-Jeff.
-Jen.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.237
-Uh, yeah, I'm looking for Karen.
-I'm doing great.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.448
-[exhales] How are you?
-Okay.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.366
Wait, is that not what you just asked?

20:01.450 --> 20:03.368
-No, not at all. Anyway, I was wondering--
-[sighs]

20:03.452 --> 20:05.579
We're getting divorced, Karen and I,
so it's, like...

20:05.662 --> 20:08.290
-Oh, wow. I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.210
Well, with the few details that I know,

20:11.293 --> 20:12.753
it kind of makes sense.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.838
-Anyway, I was wondering--
-Thank you, I appreciate it.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.174
But, you know, like,
it's for the best, right?

20:17.257 --> 20:18.217
No doubt.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.636
Obviously I feel terrible
about lying to Karen.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.222
-She did not deserve that.
-Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

20:23.305 --> 20:26.475
It's not a lie to say
that I have had love for her.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.019
It's just different with Sebastian.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.270
It seems like it would be.

20:30.354 --> 20:33.523
Love came knocking on my door,
and I had to answer.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.777
I mean, that happens, what, once,
maybe twice in a lifetime, right?

20:37.194 --> 20:39.321
-Yeah. [clears throat]
-In any case, thank you

20:39.404 --> 20:42.366
for not telling Karen
before I got a chance to.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.326
-I owe you one.
-Oh, I have the one.

20:44.618 --> 20:47.204
-Um, we were just vandalized.
-Oh.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.165
And I was wondering if I could look
at your street camera footage

20:50.249 --> 20:52.334
from the last hour just
to see if it caught anything.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.377
-Sure.
-Please.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.337
It's...

20:55.545 --> 20:56.630
Don't look at that.

20:56.713 --> 20:57.673
Oh, Jesus.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.008
Yeah, I don't make a habit of it.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.303
-No?
-The last hour. Here you go.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.724
People have, on the bright side,
been relatively supportive.

21:07.808 --> 21:08.934
Not Karen, obviously.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.353
I think this is something that's gonna
stick with her for a while.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.480
I think she's gonna remember it,

21:13.939 --> 21:16.066
but at least to my face, my parents--

21:16.149 --> 21:17.192
I need another favor.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.027
-Sure.
-Could you please delete

21:19.111 --> 21:20.737
-that from the cloud?
-Sure.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.156
And basically anything
from the last month or so?

21:23.615 --> 21:27.786
-Why? Are you also fucking Sebastian?
-[both laughing]

21:32.291 --> 21:34.209
Seriously, I need you to delete it.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.377
-Will do.
-Mm-hmm.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.004
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.133
-[clears throat] I'm gonna be okay.
-Great.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.843
It is great.

21:59.693 --> 22:00.527
Oh!

22:07.701 --> 22:09.244
[gasps]

22:10.704 --> 22:11.705
Hi.

22:12.873 --> 22:13.749
Hi.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.804
[infant crying]

22:33.935 --> 22:34.853
[laughs]

22:41.985 --> 22:43.528
Your baby's beautiful.

22:43.987 --> 22:45.947
Oh, thanks, she's not mine.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.115
I'm just a cuddler.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.200
You're a what?

22:48.867 --> 22:49.701
A cuddler.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.205
We volunteer to hold the babies
when the parents aren't around.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.500
Oh, I didn't even know that was a thing.

22:56.958 --> 22:57.793
Yeah.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.879
I feel like I get more out of it
than the babies do.

23:01.797 --> 23:02.798
You hold them for two seconds,

23:02.881 --> 23:04.424
and you forget there's anything bad
in the world.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.425
Yeah, I bet.
