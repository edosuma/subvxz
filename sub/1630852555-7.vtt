00:01.349 --> 00:03.438
Last time on Naomi...

00:03.481 --> 00:06.180
There are multiple universes
all existing in the same time
and the same space.

00:06.223 --> 00:08.486
Others refer to this
as the multiverse.

00:08.530 --> 00:11.837
STAR Labs is dangerous.
Dr. Bell is dangerous.

00:11.881 --> 00:15.015
<i>What is Zumbado hiding?</i> <i>
'Cause sometimes it feels</i> <i>
like he's just watching me.</i>

00:15.058 --> 00:16.755
You and I were allies once.

00:16.799 --> 00:19.628
I will never trust you again.

00:19.671 --> 00:20.759
I know who you are.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.457
I very much doubt that.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.285
<i>I'm on the cusp</i> <i>
of unlocking dimensions.</i>

00:24.328 --> 00:26.461
<i>It requires sacrifices.</i>

00:26.504 --> 00:29.333
You really have to go.
I should have
told you the truth.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.718
Naomi...

01:06.762 --> 01:08.024
Can you walk?

01:22.038 --> 01:24.345
Easy.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.351
- Easy.
- <i>Team six, report.</i>

01:30.394 --> 01:31.569
<i>Do you have the girl?</i>

01:38.010 --> 01:40.839
We need backup.
Fourth floor cafeteria.

01:40.883 --> 01:43.146
We need to go. Come on.

01:43.190 --> 01:46.106
Careful. Careful.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.498
Electrical room's
right up here.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.988
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.384
This building
has dampening technology.

02:03.427 --> 02:04.950
It suppresses our abilities.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.565
That should buy us some time.

02:11.914 --> 02:12.958
You need to rest.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.136
You saved me.

02:18.747 --> 02:20.270
What happened back there?

02:20.314 --> 02:22.925
That machine depleted you.
Did you feel it?

02:30.976 --> 02:33.109
It made me feel
like I was being torn apart.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.807
Like my whole body
was going to explode.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.767
Dr. Bell was trying
to repurpose your energy.

02:38.810 --> 02:41.161
Repurpose it? For what?

02:42.945 --> 02:44.251
Nothing good.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.173
Why are you helping me?

02:54.391 --> 02:55.740
I don't really know you.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.178
You don't know me.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.488
I know you better
than you think.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.534
What do you mean?

03:12.409 --> 03:14.759
I don't understand
what I've done
to make you hate me.

03:20.461 --> 03:23.115
I don't hate you, Naomi.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.901
But this place
is very dangerous.

03:25.944 --> 03:28.469
You should have listened to me.

03:28.512 --> 03:31.298
- I thought you were trying to scare me.
- I was trying to warn you.

03:31.907 --> 03:34.083
No disrespect...

03:34.126 --> 03:36.825
But how could I have known that
when you won't tell me
the truth about anything?

03:36.868 --> 03:38.696
Because you're not ready.

03:40.785 --> 03:44.963
I need answers, and if
you won't give them to me,
I'll find them another way.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.405
It's too much for you.

03:52.797 --> 03:53.929
I can handle it.

03:57.541 --> 04:03.155
Ever since
the Superman thing happened,
I've just felt confused.

04:03.199 --> 04:07.769
It's like I have these powers,
but I don't know why or how.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.902
I know I'm from this place
called Earth-29, but I don't
know anything about it.

04:12.904 --> 04:13.992
I think you do.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.821
Please just tell me the truth.

04:22.740 --> 04:23.741
You're right.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.179
It is time.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.618
The day may come
when I can't be here.

04:32.576 --> 04:33.838
What do you want to know?

04:34.448 --> 04:35.362
Everything.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.105
I don't know where to start.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.455
Start from the beginning.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.465
It's better if I show you.

04:56.252 --> 04:58.776
Xander. Hold up.
How was the game?

04:58.820 --> 05:00.343
Lost by five.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.867
Man, they'll never
stop breaking our hearts,
will they?

05:02.911 --> 05:04.782
- Yo, we still on for tonight?
- Wouldn't miss it.

05:04.826 --> 05:05.783
- Yeah?
- All right.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.437
All right.

05:11.572 --> 05:12.964
What was that?

05:13.008 --> 05:14.401
You were inside a memory.

05:16.533 --> 05:19.797
It felt real, like,
like I was actually there.

05:19.841 --> 05:22.539
Because it wasn't
a normal memory.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.933
It's something called
"mental teleportation."

05:26.021 --> 05:28.197
I established a connection
between us.

05:29.938 --> 05:31.896
You don't just see the memory,
you feel it.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.682
You experience it.

05:40.557 --> 05:41.863
Was that really you?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.955
You're wearing a jean jacket.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.960
I was different back then.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.572
I had friends.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.359
A life, a home.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.061
It's a long time ago.

06:58.374 --> 06:59.854
You don't need
to see everything.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.033
Why do I smell chocolate?

07:05.773 --> 07:07.209
Those are nebula flowers.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.211
They were at the restaurant.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.649
A nebula flower, I...

07:13.607 --> 07:14.651
I've never heard of that.

07:14.695 --> 07:17.132
No, you wouldn't have.

07:17.175 --> 07:21.266
Naomi, I'm showing you
all of this because I want you
to see what it was like.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.095
Before everything changed.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.186
<i>That was a good night.</i>

07:29.361 --> 07:31.451
<i>The last good night.</i>

07:32.408 --> 07:33.670
<i>Beautiful time...</i>

07:34.976 --> 07:36.325
<i>on a beautiful planet.</i>

07:38.022 --> 07:40.068
That was Earth-29?

07:40.111 --> 07:43.332
We just call it Earth, but...
But, yes.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.901
I can't believe I finally
got to see where I'm from.

07:46.944 --> 07:49.425
- It has two moons.
- Many planets do.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.950
One moon is rare.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.822
This Earth is unusual
in that way.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.825
Why are the planets red?

07:57.868 --> 07:59.696
They absorb light differently.

08:00.741 --> 08:01.829
It's beautiful.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.006
It used to be.

08:15.016 --> 08:19.411
I met a woman in Portland, the disc led me to her.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.805
Akira.

08:23.633 --> 08:28.595
She said that you...
ruined the planet.

08:28.638 --> 08:31.554
Don't believe everything
that people tell you, Naomi.

08:32.860 --> 08:36.428
You have to learn
to think for yourself.

08:36.472 --> 08:39.301
But how can I do that
if I don't have
all the information?

08:39.344 --> 08:41.085
Look, ever since
I've gotten my powers,

08:41.129 --> 08:44.785
you've shown up
in strange places
telling me to stay away.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.569
Why are you just now
telling me the truth?

08:49.920 --> 08:51.748
Some truths
are too much to bear.

08:51.792 --> 08:54.098
What could be so terrible...

08:54.142 --> 08:55.578
that you'd rather scare me?

08:59.843 --> 09:01.410
You need to go.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.412
- How do you feel?
- I'm better.

09:03.455 --> 09:04.979
Okay. Okay.

09:11.507 --> 09:14.597
You're not going to like it,
but according to the blueprints
I stole,

09:14.641 --> 09:15.816
this is our way out.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.038
Is that a ventilation duct?

09:21.082 --> 09:22.649
Not exactly.

09:22.692 --> 09:26.130
STAR Labs is powered
by something
called plasma physics.

09:26.174 --> 09:30.134
The idea that burning plasma
creates a self-sustaining
fusion reaction.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.790
This is how they ventilate it.

09:33.834 --> 09:37.185
So if we get stuck in here,
we'll drown
in burning plasma.

09:41.668 --> 09:44.584
Naomi. We have
a 30-minute window
before they ventilate again.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.368
We can make it.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.678
- Hello?
- Hi, honey! Come on in.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.854
Hi, Mrs. M.
Do I smell pineapple?

09:53.897 --> 09:56.291
- Greg's making dinner.
- Is that Annabelle?

09:56.334 --> 09:58.641
Hi, Mr. M.
What's on the menu for tonight?

09:58.685 --> 10:03.559
- My specially homemade pizza with sourdough crust and--
- Fresh marinara sauce?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.169
You always make the best pies.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.476
- We're trying out the new pizza oven.
- You want to join?

10:07.519 --> 10:09.478
We have plenty
of fresh pineapple.

10:09.521 --> 10:13.743
You know, I love a good
tropical pizza, but I actually
came to see Naomi.

10:13.787 --> 10:16.311
We thought she was
at the game with you.

10:16.354 --> 10:20.010
Right, yep. She, she was
at the game with me tonight.

10:20.054 --> 10:25.276
And, uh, I am here now
because we were going
to study together.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.627
So, always be hustling, right?

10:27.670 --> 10:30.412
I bet we probably said
my house, and I just forgot.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.544
I blame it on
the rush of victory, you know?

10:32.588 --> 10:34.024
So, go Ducks!

10:34.068 --> 10:35.635
Uh-oh.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.767
- I hope that's not my crust. Crust!
- Oh, God.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.299
Babe, where the hell are you?

10:50.780 --> 10:52.564
No, I don't think
I can do this.

10:52.608 --> 10:55.045
You can.
Just breathe through it.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.703
I thought you were
going to tell me
that I'm a disappointment.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.142
I'm only disappointed because
I know who you could be.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.362
Not for being afraid.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.408
Shhh...

11:11.932 --> 11:13.760
We're in the south wing,
we don't see them.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.721
Let's wait until it's clear.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.508
Naomi...

11:23.552 --> 11:26.294
When I was younger,
I used to be scared
all the time.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.644
Of almost everything.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.169
It's like the fear
just wouldn't let me go.

11:33.257 --> 11:35.477
But without fear,
there can be no courage.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.611
You were scared.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.266
I felt it.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.963
I thought I was gonna die.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.965
People from our planet can die?

12:29.009 --> 12:30.837
I thought maybe everyone
had powers.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.708
Before that night, no one did.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.841
So yours...

12:34.884 --> 12:37.452
were caused
by a purple meteor strike?

12:37.495 --> 12:39.584
Not exactly.

12:39.628 --> 12:42.196
What about my powers?
Did I get them that night?

12:42.239 --> 12:44.285
This happened
before you were born, Naomi.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.810
Your powers are different.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.595
For a long time,
no one had any answers.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.423
Some thought
we were being invaded.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.339
Others thought
it was an accident.

12:56.732 --> 12:59.300
Later, we found out it was
an environmental disaster.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.476
Like global warming?

13:01.519 --> 13:03.652
Humans are careless
with their planet.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.785
We weren't.

13:07.656 --> 13:10.093
What happened that night
was beyond our control.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.838
- So everyone got powers that night?
- No.

13:15.882 --> 13:19.363
Do you remember
what you felt like
after Superman came?

13:19.407 --> 13:21.409
Once you realized
that you were different?

13:24.238 --> 13:26.849
Yeah, I, I felt alone.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.808
Like no one could
really understand me.

13:30.592 --> 13:31.767
I felt that way, too.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.118
Until I realized...

13:36.119 --> 13:37.207
I wasn't alone.

13:45.346 --> 13:49.002
Sometimes I forget
how lucky we are to live
in such a beautiful world.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.875
Couldn't agree more.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.183
Buy you a drink?

13:59.534 --> 14:01.536
Not the kind of person
you wanna have a drink with.

14:02.450 --> 14:03.538
Not anymore.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.585
You're wrong
about that, Zumbado.

14:11.241 --> 14:12.329
How do you know my name?

14:13.504 --> 14:14.375
Hmm.

14:16.116 --> 14:20.294
I've never understood
why people equate
fire with death.

14:21.948 --> 14:24.211
I understand it can be
destructive, but...

14:25.952 --> 14:27.823
fire can also mean
a new beginning.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.346
Fresh start.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.088
My name is Akira.

14:36.963 --> 14:40.009
So enough about me.
What do you do?

14:40.053 --> 14:44.796
I am a mineralogist
specializing in the composition
of rare particles.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.190
Hmm. That sounds pretty important.

14:47.234 --> 14:51.716
Well, I don't know about that,
but my work
does allow me access

14:51.760 --> 14:54.632
to real time discrepancies
here on the planet.

14:54.676 --> 14:57.070
One of them
happened around here.

14:57.113 --> 15:00.290
- So that explains how you found me.
- Hmm.

15:00.334 --> 15:03.380
But it doesn't explain
how you...

15:03.424 --> 15:06.601
- came to be able to do that.
- I can't explain it either.

15:08.646 --> 15:12.172
The night it happened,
I saw the comets,

15:12.215 --> 15:13.434
I felt the earthquake...

15:15.175 --> 15:17.525
And then I discovered
I could manipulate fire.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.529
So what do you think
caused these...

15:22.704 --> 15:24.184
I don't even know
what to call it, I mean...

15:25.359 --> 15:27.274
abilities.

15:27.317 --> 15:30.320
There have been
evolutionary mutations before,

15:30.364 --> 15:31.931
but this was...

15:32.670 --> 15:33.584
sudden.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.326
It was precise.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.676
- I have a theory.
- What's that?

15:40.678 --> 15:41.766
Destiny.

15:45.683 --> 15:48.686
What, like we're all a part
of some cosmic plan?

15:49.992 --> 15:52.125
You really believe that?

15:52.168 --> 15:56.999
I know that there are forces
at work in the universe
that are beyond our control.

15:57.043 --> 16:00.133
And that we all have
a role to play in it
whether we know that or not.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.049
I don't believe in fate.

16:03.484 --> 16:04.441
Hmm.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.358
Maybe one day you will.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.883
We might not be the only ones.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.940
We need to go.
We need to keep moving.

16:26.724 --> 16:29.162
We need to hurry.

16:29.205 --> 16:32.556
Just keep moving. Remember
what I said about fear.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.250
Please don't touch that.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.123
Dee! Um, hi.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.689
- I'm, um--
- Annabelle.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.387
Yes, I know.

17:23.172 --> 17:26.567
I've always wanted
to get a tattoo,
but I'm very afraid of needles.

17:27.350 --> 17:28.569
What's your stance on henna?

17:30.049 --> 17:32.355
What can I do for you?

17:32.399 --> 17:36.185
I was supposed to meet
Naomi here tonight.
After the game.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.667
I just arrived back in town.

17:40.842 --> 17:43.366
Oh. Right...

17:43.410 --> 17:46.891
Naomi wanted to get in
a little late night training
before celebrating at Murray's.

17:46.935 --> 17:47.762
So...

17:51.026 --> 17:51.896
Annabelle.

17:54.769 --> 17:56.379
What is wrong?

17:56.423 --> 17:59.165
What?
Nothing's wrong,
everything's fine.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.173
I can't find Naomi.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.392
She said that she was going
to meet me at the game,
but she didn't show up.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.354
When did you last see her?

18:15.746 --> 18:17.096
At school this afternoon.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.230
Can you find her with your...
You know?

18:31.675 --> 18:34.069
- Naomi told you?
- Don't be mad.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.680
We tell each other everything.
We're like Thelma and Louise.

18:38.073 --> 18:39.727
Finneas and Billie Eilish.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.209
Oh! Snoop Dogg
and Martha Stewart.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.695
Do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

18:54.045 --> 18:54.916
No.

18:57.005 --> 19:00.791
But I do know that she had
another scary run in
with scary Zumbado.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.016
Where are we going?

19:08.059 --> 19:10.366
I thought you said
that Dr. Bell
closed all the exits.

19:10.410 --> 19:13.195
You still can get
to the lower level.
We can use the stairs.

19:14.762 --> 19:17.156
Do you think that she knows
that we're here?

19:17.199 --> 19:18.853
If she did,
she'd already be here.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.255
Was Akira right?

19:30.691 --> 19:32.083
Were there others like you?

19:35.652 --> 19:36.479
Yes.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.134
There were 29 of us.

19:40.309 --> 19:41.267
29?

19:42.224 --> 19:43.573
Like the writing on the disc?

20:03.550 --> 20:05.639
<i>Hold up.</i> <i>
Were you a superhero?</i>

20:05.682 --> 20:08.424
<i>Superheroes live</i> <i>
in the pages of comic books.</i>

20:08.468 --> 20:12.036
They wear a mask
and a uniform.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.212
It wasn't like that.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.216
<i>We tried to do good.</i>

20:19.305 --> 20:21.568
<i>We were spread out</i> <i>
all over the world.</i>

20:22.525 --> 20:23.918
<i>We became a symbol of hope.</i>

20:26.529 --> 20:29.315
<i>But no matter</i> <i>
how much good we did,</i>

20:29.358 --> 20:31.360
<i>we couldn't stop</i> <i>
what had been put in motion.</i>

20:32.318 --> 20:33.580
<i>The planet was dying.</i>

20:47.289 --> 20:48.638
How is this happening?

20:48.682 --> 20:50.684
Thy way you're absorbing
my memories.

20:52.425 --> 20:53.904
They're coming to life.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.776
I've never seen
power like that.

20:55.819 --> 20:57.081
But you have powers.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.606
Not like yours, Naomi.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.347
Power like that is dangerous.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.132
It was for us, too.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.873
Not everyone liked
what we were doing.

21:08.658 --> 21:09.703
Stop!

21:11.792 --> 21:12.967
Did you hear something?

21:14.882 --> 21:16.013
He's disappeared.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.321
- Find him.
- He's over here!

21:19.365 --> 21:20.409
Watch out!

21:29.026 --> 21:30.201
They were hunting you.

21:30.941 --> 21:31.812
Yes.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.337
That was too much.

21:35.381 --> 21:36.643
I shouldn't have
shown you that.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.427
No.

21:38.471 --> 21:41.038
I don't understand.
Who were they?

21:41.082 --> 21:42.910
They work for a man
named Brutus.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.696
Although he wasn't
exactly a man.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.351
No one even knew where
Brutus came from.

21:49.395 --> 21:52.441
He resented the 29,
but it was manageable.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.577
But then one day,
he came for us.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.711
But you were helping people.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.888
Why would they try
to come after you?

22:07.848 --> 22:10.329
Zumbado,
what's happening?

22:10.372 --> 22:13.723
Dr. Bell knows we're here.
We need to move quickly.

22:15.986 --> 22:18.249
<i>Four,</i> <i>
southwest corner.</i>

22:18.293 --> 22:20.426
<i>I applaud</i> <i>
your resilience.</i>

22:20.469 --> 22:23.385
<i>But surely you realize</i> <i>
by now that this</i> <i>
escape attempt is futile.</i>

22:23.429 --> 22:26.345
<i>I admit that</i> <i>
mistakes were made.</i>

22:26.388 --> 22:29.043
<i>True scientific advancement</i> <i>
requires trial and error.</i>

22:29.086 --> 22:30.914
I really only need one of you.

22:32.263 --> 22:34.048
I don't care which one.

22:34.091 --> 22:38.618
Second floor clear,
nothing here in my floor.

22:38.661 --> 22:40.576
There are people here.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.448
But only thing,
I can't see anything.

22:47.453 --> 22:48.410
Everywhere.

22:51.631 --> 22:52.849
<i>You have</i> <i>
eyes on them?</i>

22:52.893 --> 22:54.895
I know how to
get us out of here. Go. Go.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.814
I see them through the wall.

23:01.467 --> 23:02.381
They're coming.

23:06.472 --> 23:09.170
<i>I got movement</i> <i>
on east wing.</i> <i>
I need back up now!</i>

23:09.213 --> 23:10.824
Copy that. I'm on my way.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.392
We're clear.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.443
They're just humans.
This will slow them down.
Let's go.

23:35.762 --> 23:36.763
We can rest for a minute.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.728
You knew this place
suppresses our powers.

23:45.772 --> 23:47.164
You knew that coming in here.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.211
But you came anyway.

23:52.256 --> 23:53.388
You needed me.

23:56.913 --> 24:00.569
All this time,
I thought you didn't want
anything to do with me.

24:02.353 --> 24:03.790
I thought you were my enemy.

24:07.097 --> 24:09.622
Don't believe everything
that you think.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.895
Thought you weren't coming.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.462
I'm sure you were very worried.

24:26.073 --> 24:28.510
We shouldn't be meeting
out in the open like this.
It's dangerous.

24:30.947 --> 24:32.209
Are the others safe?

24:33.210 --> 24:34.647
In a manner of speaking.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.567
Akira, what's wrong?

24:43.438 --> 24:46.528
Do you remember what I said
about this the night we met?

24:46.572 --> 24:49.575
I told you it reminded me
of how beautiful our planet is.

24:49.618 --> 24:50.663
You agreed.

24:53.013 --> 24:55.015
I shouldn't have believed you.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.060
Why did you do it, Zumbado?

24:59.019 --> 25:00.586
I've no idea
what you're talking about.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.326
Brutus found us.

25:02.805 --> 25:04.415
All of us.

25:04.459 --> 25:07.506
That's not possible.

25:07.549 --> 25:10.509
- The only way that that could happen is--
- Is if you gave him the disc.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.033
You can't really believe that.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.557
Brutus told me the truth.

25:15.601 --> 25:18.604
He showed me the disc.
He told me it was you.

25:19.430 --> 25:20.519
And you believe him?

25:21.607 --> 25:23.609
You believe Brutus?

25:23.652 --> 25:27.569
I would never betray you,
or any of the 29.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.354
There's no one else to blame.

25:30.398 --> 25:34.837
And now all of us
are on the run because of you.
Because of what you've done.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.233
Please, Akira.

25:39.276 --> 25:40.582
Don't do this.

25:40.626 --> 25:41.888
You're making a mistake.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.325
The only mistake I ever made
was trusting you.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.415
Goodbye, Zumbado.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.162
<i>Akira betrayed you.</i>

25:57.338 --> 25:59.383
She thinks
that I betrayed the 29.

26:00.646 --> 26:01.690
She still does.

26:04.171 --> 26:06.782
Who did betray them?

26:09.176 --> 26:10.090
I don't know.

26:11.221 --> 26:12.832
I couldn't stay to find out.

26:15.443 --> 26:16.792
I had to leave my planet.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.143
My home.

26:25.671 --> 26:26.889
We need to keep moving.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.595
Zumbado left in a hurry.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.293
Now he leaves
the place unlocked?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.644
I mean, maybe he always
leaves it unlocked.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.646
It's not like I have any
first-hand knowledge of it.

26:44.690 --> 26:45.995
I already know
you broke in here.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.304
So much
for a life of crime.

26:57.572 --> 26:58.660
STAR Labs.

26:58.704 --> 27:01.489
Wait. Do you know
about STAR Labs?

27:01.532 --> 27:03.665
Do you know about STAR Labs?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.580
Naomi told me about it.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.670
She said that Zumbado
stole a device
from some scientists there.

27:08.714 --> 27:11.891
- Dr. Chimes or Ring, or--
- Dr. Bell.

27:11.934 --> 27:15.329
That's it. Naomi met with her,
and now she's a straight up
Dr. Bell stan.

27:15.372 --> 27:18.898
Naomi met with Dr. Bell?

27:18.941 --> 27:21.117
Yeah, I figured she'd
text you about it.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.076
Although, can you get
texts in space?

27:23.119 --> 27:24.730
Is that where you were,
right before...

27:25.295 --> 27:26.688
Annabelle.

27:26.732 --> 27:30.300
If Naomi's at STAR Labs,
then she's in trouble.

27:30.344 --> 27:33.173
There's dangerous research
being conducted there.

27:33.216 --> 27:36.437
I've been keeping an eye
on Dr. Bell for a while.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.221
Why would Zumbado
be there, too?

27:40.833 --> 27:42.008
I don't know.

27:49.102 --> 27:51.147
Once we get to the bottom,
there's a hallway.

27:51.191 --> 27:54.455
That will lead to
a service door. It's less
fortified than the other exits.

27:54.498 --> 27:57.763
- You may have to fight.
- You mean we may have to fight?

27:58.764 --> 28:00.374
Yes.

28:00.417 --> 28:04.552
Our powers will work better
once we get closer to the exit.

28:04.595 --> 28:07.729
Of all the planets
in this universe, why did you
come to this Earth?

28:07.773 --> 28:11.124
That's a story for another day.

28:11.167 --> 28:14.693
I've moved a lot,
but I can't imagine
moving to another planet.

28:18.087 --> 28:19.219
It was strange.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.048
Difficult.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.232
<i>On this earth...</i>

28:32.275 --> 28:34.756
<i>people like us</i> <i>
were treated differently.</i>

28:36.758 --> 28:38.455
<i>Not just because of our powers.</i>

28:43.112 --> 28:45.245
<i>The thing that I love</i> <i>
about cars...</i>

28:45.288 --> 28:47.464
<i>is the precision.</i>

28:47.508 --> 28:50.729
<i>There's always an order</i> <i>
to things, a solution.</i>

28:51.730 --> 28:53.079
<i>Humans don't work like that.</i>

28:54.384 --> 28:55.864
<i>So I had to adapt.</i>

29:03.176 --> 29:04.699
<i>It took me a long time.</i>

29:06.745 --> 29:08.094
<i>But now I understand.</i>

29:18.931 --> 29:21.411
I thought you were
using this place
to rip people off.

29:35.338 --> 29:36.383
I'm sorry.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.300
For how I've treated you.

29:41.997 --> 29:43.607
For what I've believed
about you.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.441
I appreciate you saying that.

29:58.448 --> 30:00.059
We need to keep going.

30:05.499 --> 30:08.110
I'll buy you some time.
You can make it.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.764
What are you talking about?

30:10.460 --> 30:12.201
I'm sorry, Naomi.

30:12.245 --> 30:14.116
I should have told you
the truth a long time ago.

30:15.422 --> 30:16.771
You run.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.164
- Don't look back.
- No!

30:19.600 --> 30:21.732
- Zumbado!
- Go, Naomi!

30:24.953 --> 30:25.911
Go!

30:39.750 --> 30:41.622
Why do you care about Earth-29?

30:42.405 --> 30:44.059
I don't.

30:44.103 --> 30:47.497
This isn't about accessing any
one-dimensionary universe.

30:47.541 --> 30:48.847
It's about reaching
all of them.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.720
You say that
like it's a good thing.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.550
You wanna open a portal
to a new world,

30:56.593 --> 30:58.421
but have you considered
what might come back?

31:12.958 --> 31:15.308
Fourth floor
West hallway, clear.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.407
This is a very exciting moment.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.151
What happens if it works?

31:32.194 --> 31:34.153
I appreciate your interest.

31:34.196 --> 31:37.504
If it works, you'll be
sent through the portal
to another dimension.

31:38.331 --> 31:39.462
And if it doesn't?

31:41.421 --> 31:42.857
Let's try to stay positive.

31:51.344 --> 31:52.998
I know it doesn't feel like it.

31:53.041 --> 31:55.609
I mean, you are a part
of something
very special right now.

31:59.134 --> 32:01.484
This is my life's work.

32:03.225 --> 32:04.357
My destiny.

32:19.459 --> 32:20.982
You're right about one thing.

32:22.157 --> 32:23.724
This is about destiny.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.598
Just not yours.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.441
Miss McDuffie.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.052
I'm glad you saved me
the trouble of finding you.

32:48.444 --> 32:49.619
Let him go.

32:50.185 --> 32:51.273
Shut it down.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.101
It was foolish of you
to return.

33:23.566 --> 33:24.393
No!

33:36.144 --> 33:37.624
No.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.582
What're you doing?
We need to go.

33:39.626 --> 33:43.195
- I can stop it.
- Forget her. Let's go.

33:49.636 --> 33:51.159
Zumbado...

34:07.088 --> 34:08.698
I have a car outside.

34:18.273 --> 34:20.536
I can't believe Zumbado
didn't want to carpool with us.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.538
We need to have a team name.

34:22.582 --> 34:24.758
I mean, every superhero
has a team name.

34:24.801 --> 34:27.369
Team Naomi.
Obvious, but classic.

34:27.413 --> 34:31.417
Naomi and special guests.
Naomi, Annabelle,
and Dee make three?

34:31.460 --> 34:33.288
We will not be
making this a habit.

34:35.421 --> 34:36.335
Thank you.

34:38.989 --> 34:39.903
Both of you...

34:43.168 --> 34:44.517
See you guys tomorrow.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.564
So, should we...

34:49.130 --> 34:50.262
exchange numbers?

34:51.741 --> 34:53.352
That will not be necessary.

34:53.395 --> 34:56.181
Right, right.
Because now that we're friends,
I can just

34:56.224 --> 34:57.834
come to the tattoo shop whenever.

34:59.706 --> 35:01.621
That is not exactly
what I was thinking.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.975
But, if you ever need me,

35:08.018 --> 35:09.585
you know where to find me.

35:11.457 --> 35:13.023
You are a good friend, Annabelle.

35:15.156 --> 35:16.549
Naomi's lucky to have you.

35:18.551 --> 35:19.813
She's lucky to have you, too.

35:25.906 --> 35:29.344
- One more slice.
- Oh, yeah.

35:29.388 --> 35:30.911
For the chef.

35:31.564 --> 35:32.478
The chef.

35:37.309 --> 35:39.659
I really hope Dad
didn't eat all the pizza.

35:39.702 --> 35:42.531
Well, you're just in time.
The latest pie is fresh
out of the oven.

35:42.575 --> 35:45.099
I've been experimenting
with mushrooms tonight.

35:47.362 --> 35:48.363
Thank you.

35:54.630 --> 35:56.110
I think this might be
your best one yet.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.894
That's what I'm saying.

35:57.938 --> 36:01.202
Okay.
Oh, did Annabelle find you?

36:01.246 --> 36:04.597
- What do you mean?
- She came by looking for you earlier.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.860
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I talked to her.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.172
You, you feeling okay, baby?

36:14.215 --> 36:15.477
I'm fine.

36:17.610 --> 36:20.526
I just think I need more pizza.

36:20.569 --> 36:23.268
Pizza is always the right answer.

36:23.311 --> 36:24.747
Here...

36:24.791 --> 36:27.576
- one for you.
- Yes...

36:27.620 --> 36:28.925
- There's one for me.
- Thank you.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.670
<i>I was different</i> <i>
back then.</i>

36:35.454 --> 36:37.934
<i>I had friends. A life.</i>

36:38.761 --> 36:39.719
<i>A home.</i>

36:54.299 --> 36:55.909
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:09.139 --> 37:11.446
What do you think happened
to Dr. Bell?

37:11.490 --> 37:14.275
Do you think she somehow
opened up a portal?

37:16.234 --> 37:17.191
I hope not.

37:18.148 --> 37:19.237
For all of our sakes.

37:24.329 --> 37:27.288
I've been thinking
about your story.

37:27.332 --> 37:30.291
You told me that you
and the rest of the 29
were hunted,

37:31.118 --> 37:32.380
but you didn't say why.

37:33.686 --> 37:34.774
It's not important.

37:35.992 --> 37:38.865
What is important,
is that you're safe.

37:51.094 --> 37:54.402
Brutus found out
that two members of the 29
had a child

37:56.186 --> 37:57.927
It doesn't sound
like such a big deal.

37:59.364 --> 38:00.452
Weren't there others?

38:01.104 --> 38:02.018
No.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.499
There was only one.

38:09.156 --> 38:12.333
Brutus thought that her power
would mean the end for him.

38:12.377 --> 38:16.250
A random incident is one thing,
but a new bloodline is another.

38:18.948 --> 38:22.038
- Wait. Are you saying...
- You were that child, Naomi.

38:23.257 --> 38:25.433
Your parents
were two of the 29.

38:26.521 --> 38:28.306
That's why you have powers.

38:29.524 --> 38:30.612
My parents...

38:33.615 --> 38:34.573
Did you know them?

38:34.616 --> 38:35.661
Yes.

38:37.489 --> 38:38.707
Who were they?

38:38.751 --> 38:40.970
What were they like?
What happened to them?

38:41.014 --> 38:42.232
They were the best of us.

38:44.931 --> 38:47.325
They were the only ones
who believed
that I was innocent.

38:51.677 --> 38:54.549
I made your parents a promise.

38:54.593 --> 38:57.639
That if anything ever happened
to them, I will find you.

38:59.293 --> 39:00.425
I will keep you safe.

39:06.169 --> 39:08.607
<i>By the time I finally found you</i> <i>
here on Earth,</i>

39:09.956 --> 39:12.175
<i>you were safe.</i>

39:12.219 --> 39:14.482
<i>I saw the mother
and the father that you needed.</i>

39:14.526 --> 39:16.136
<i>You were loved.</i>

39:18.965 --> 39:20.445
<i>I knew they would</i> <i>
take care of you.</i>

39:23.578 --> 39:25.537
<i>I settled in Port Oswego.</i>

39:28.235 --> 39:31.630
<i>But I always checked in,</i> <i>
no matter where you were.</i>

39:31.673 --> 39:33.545
I wonder what
it's gonna taste like.

39:45.557 --> 39:47.167
You've been here
this whole time.

39:48.342 --> 39:50.344
Waiting for you to be ready.

39:51.737 --> 39:54.000
To unlock the powers
within you.

39:55.871 --> 39:57.307
You did this all for me?

40:00.528 --> 40:04.750
All this time I thought you were a used-car salesman.

40:07.622 --> 40:08.884
I'm not a used-car salesman.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.366
I've never been
a used-car salesman.

40:15.543 --> 40:16.936
I'm here for one reason.

40:18.590 --> 40:21.636
So that when this day came,
you wouldn't be alone.

40:25.814 --> 40:27.207
I don't know what to say.

40:33.996 --> 40:35.868
Now that you know the truth,

40:37.304 --> 40:38.740
it's time to get you ready.

40:40.612 --> 40:42.004
Ready for what?

40:42.048 --> 40:44.093
Your powers
are acting like a magnet.

40:44.964 --> 40:46.400
Brutus will send others.

40:47.532 --> 40:48.576
Like the bounty hunter.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.405
How do you know about him?

40:52.537 --> 40:54.408
He's not the first one
to come for you.

40:55.714 --> 40:57.019
And he won't be the last.

41:01.502 --> 41:04.505
You have
a greater destiny, Naomi.

41:06.246 --> 41:07.421
That can be difficult.

41:09.684 --> 41:10.903
Dangerous.

41:13.253 --> 41:15.168
I thought you didn't
believe in destiny.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.475
I do now.

41:25.265 --> 41:26.832
You're gonna save our world.
