00:18.520 --> 00:20.480
All right, everybody, come on.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.398
Out on the dance floor.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.235
Look at the happy couple.

00:25.276 --> 00:28.071
No exceptions.
Up out of your chairs.

00:34.619 --> 00:37.580
I can feel
all the happiness in here.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.625
All right!

00:43.711 --> 00:45.672
Look at him go.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.383
If I...

00:48.424 --> 00:53.179
I get to know your name...

00:54.305 --> 00:56.641
If I...

00:56.683 --> 01:02.021
Could trace
your private number, baby...

01:02.063 --> 01:04.232
All I know is that to me...

01:04.274 --> 01:05.900
You look like
you're lots of fun.

01:05.942 --> 01:07.902
Open up them lovin' arms.

01:07.944 --> 01:10.613
I want some, want some.

01:11.781 --> 01:14.284
I set my sights on you.

01:14.325 --> 01:17.078
And no one else will do.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.746
And I...

01:18.788 --> 01:24.586
I got to have my way now, baby.

01:24.627 --> 01:27.005
All I know is that to me...

01:27.046 --> 01:28.840
You look like
you're lots of fun.

01:28.882 --> 01:30.508
Open up them lovin' arms.

01:30.550 --> 01:33.011
Watch out, here I come.

01:33.052 --> 01:36.764
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

01:36.806 --> 01:38.308
Like a record, baby...

01:38.349 --> 01:40.643
Right round, round, round.

01:40.685 --> 01:44.397
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

01:44.439 --> 01:45.857
Like a record, baby...

01:45.899 --> 01:48.484
Right round, round, round.

01:48.526 --> 01:51.029
Somebody get some pants
on that kid.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.535
If I...

01:57.577 --> 01:59.662
I got to be your friend...

01:59.704 --> 02:02.665
Grandma Molly,
I'm talking to you.

02:02.707 --> 02:05.168
And I...

02:05.210 --> 02:10.632
Would like to move in
just a little bit closer.

02:10.673 --> 02:12.509
All I know is that to me...

02:12.550 --> 02:14.427
You look like
you're lots of fun.

02:14.427 --> 02:16.429
Open up your lovin' arms.

02:16.429 --> 02:18.723
Watch out, here I come.

02:18.765 --> 02:22.435
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

02:22.477 --> 02:23.561
Like a record, baby...

02:23.603 --> 02:26.064
Right round, round, round.

02:26.105 --> 02:29.984
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

02:30.026 --> 02:31.903
Like a record, baby.

02:31.945 --> 02:39.327
I want your love.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.336
Uncle Marty!

02:48.378 --> 02:50.588
All I know is that to me...

02:50.630 --> 02:52.423
You look like
you're lots of fun.

02:52.465 --> 02:54.133
Open up your lovin' arms.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.553
Watch out, here I come.

02:56.594 --> 03:00.473
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

03:00.515 --> 03:01.891
Like a record, baby...

03:01.933 --> 03:04.310
Right round, round, round.

03:04.352 --> 03:08.022
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

03:08.064 --> 03:09.566
Like a record, baby...

03:09.607 --> 03:11.234
Right round, round, round.

03:11.276 --> 03:14.654
You spin me round...

03:14.654 --> 03:15.655
And round...

03:15.655 --> 03:17.991
And round.

03:17.991 --> 03:19.325
Very nice.

03:21.536 --> 03:23.246
Good job, lady.
You were shakin'.

03:24.831 --> 03:27.375
It is gonna be fun today.

03:27.417 --> 03:30.253
The best man's gonna come up
and say a few words...

03:30.295 --> 03:33.464
so let's put our hands together
for the groom's brother David.

03:36.134 --> 03:37.594
All right, Dave.

03:47.520 --> 03:51.649
When my brother Harold
asked me to be the best man...

03:51.691 --> 03:55.403
I was like,
"Whoa, of course, man...

03:55.445 --> 03:57.197
"because you've always
been there for me."

03:58.865 --> 04:02.827
Like when I was in rehab...

04:02.869 --> 04:05.455
and like the time
I couldn't find my car.

04:06.706 --> 04:10.335
'Cause, Harold, he's always been
the dependable one.

04:10.376 --> 04:14.005
I've always been
the screwed-up one. Right, Dad?

04:16.548 --> 04:19.219
"Why can't you
be more like your brother?

04:19.260 --> 04:22.096
"Harold would never
beat up his landlord."

04:23.723 --> 04:26.184
He's drunk as shit.

04:29.854 --> 04:31.314
But...

04:31.356 --> 04:32.398
a little news flash, Pop.

04:34.025 --> 04:35.360
Harold ain't so perfect.

04:36.819 --> 04:38.780
Remember that time
in Puerto Rico...

04:38.821 --> 04:41.699
when we picked up those two...

04:41.741 --> 04:44.369
I guess they were prostitutes,
but I don't remember paying.

04:44.410 --> 04:45.954
How about that?

04:47.580 --> 04:48.706
Terrific.

04:48.748 --> 04:50.542
I'm a person, too,
Pop, goddamn it!

04:51.709 --> 04:53.086
You're a moron!

04:56.464 --> 04:57.715
The best man, everybody.

04:57.757 --> 04:59.467
Best man. The better man.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.891
We've all done crazy things
in our life, so...

05:08.601 --> 05:10.520
He's playing the guitar now.
Isn't that great?

05:12.272 --> 05:13.398
He's doing good.

05:13.439 --> 05:14.607
Sounds good?

05:14.649 --> 05:16.818
It's because I'm the best
guitar player in the world.

05:16.860 --> 05:18.361
Self-taught.

05:18.403 --> 05:21.197
No lessons,
thank you very much, Pop.

05:21.239 --> 05:22.407
All right.

05:23.741 --> 05:24.909
They'll be divorced in a year.

05:24.951 --> 05:26.411
Very good.

05:26.452 --> 05:30.456
I think we all know
that when you fall in love...

05:30.498 --> 05:32.542
the emptiness
kind of drifts away.

05:32.584 --> 05:34.335
That's all I'm talking about.

05:34.377 --> 05:37.380
I've done some crazy things
in my life, too...

05:37.422 --> 05:40.258
but then I met
a very special girl...

05:40.300 --> 05:42.135
a girl who I'm actually
marrying next week.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.013
Thank you.

05:45.054 --> 05:48.892
So all I'm saying is that
when you fall in love...

05:48.933 --> 05:50.894
the emptiness drifts away...

05:50.935 --> 05:52.604
because you find something
to live for...

05:52.645 --> 05:53.646
each other.

05:53.646 --> 05:55.648
And the way
I've seen you two...

05:55.690 --> 05:57.400
looking into each other's
eyes all day long...

05:57.442 --> 05:59.319
I can tell that you're
gonna live for each other...

05:59.360 --> 06:00.570
for the rest of your lives.

06:02.655 --> 06:04.157
So cheers.

06:08.453 --> 06:10.538
That's a good
wedding singer.

06:14.292 --> 06:18.379
Now on behalf of
Mr. and Mrs. Harold Veltri...

06:18.421 --> 06:20.548
you guys have a nice dinner.

06:20.590 --> 06:22.842
George Stitzer's gonna take over
on lead vocals...

06:22.842 --> 06:24.260
so take it away, George.

06:32.185 --> 06:36.523
Give me time...

06:38.525 --> 06:42.987
To realize my crime.

06:44.697 --> 06:51.079
Let me love and stay.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.665
-Jesus.
-Scary.

06:56.835 --> 07:01.589
I have danced...

07:03.591 --> 07:05.176
I like her.

07:05.218 --> 07:08.805
Inside your eyes.

07:10.348 --> 07:13.810
How can love...

07:13.852 --> 07:17.856
Be real?

07:19.983 --> 07:22.777
Do you really want to hurt me?

07:22.819 --> 07:25.864
Good save, wedding singer.

07:25.905 --> 07:27.365
Good job.

07:27.407 --> 07:30.368
Sammy, how come you're not out
with your limo? What's up?

07:30.410 --> 07:32.120
That new waitress.
That's what's up.

07:32.161 --> 07:34.581
Is she in trouble.

07:34.581 --> 07:36.416
She's gonna get it,
and she doesn't even know it...

07:36.457 --> 07:37.709
and I'm gonna give it to her.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.336
Take it easy, man. Who is she?

07:40.378 --> 07:41.838
She's Holly Sullivan's cousin.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.464
If she's
half as easy as Holly...

07:43.506 --> 07:45.258
I'll close this deal
by the end of the week.

07:48.011 --> 07:49.304
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

07:49.345 --> 07:51.681
Please. It's her first day.

07:51.723 --> 07:53.224
Always takes them three weeks...

07:53.266 --> 07:55.101
to realize they shouldn't
date anyone at work.

07:55.101 --> 07:58.479
You like being the guy
that helps them realize that?

07:58.521 --> 08:00.064
Yes, I do.

08:00.106 --> 08:02.192
You want to be like Fonzie,
don't you?

08:03.776 --> 08:05.236
You're on your way.

08:06.529 --> 08:11.576
Do you really want to hurt me?

08:11.618 --> 08:15.163
Do you really want
to make me cry?

08:24.923 --> 08:26.299
Prime rib, please.

08:26.299 --> 08:29.636
Always the prime rib.
Make them eat the fish.

08:29.636 --> 08:31.638
Andre,
can I have three prime rib?

08:31.679 --> 08:34.097
Your wish is my command, madame.

08:35.350 --> 08:38.394
How come he's so nice to you?

08:38.436 --> 08:41.231
I let him look at my boobs
at the Christmas party.

08:41.272 --> 08:43.650
Not my finest half-hour...

08:43.650 --> 08:46.778
but it's been a pleasant
working environment ever since.

08:51.449 --> 08:53.910
So, how's your first night
going?

08:55.078 --> 08:57.205
Being at this wedding
is making me realize...

08:57.247 --> 08:59.207
that Glenn is never
going to set a date...

08:59.249 --> 09:01.459
and I've been wearing
this ring for two years...

09:01.501 --> 09:03.002
and I feel like an idiot.

09:03.044 --> 09:04.796
You know what you must do?

09:05.964 --> 09:08.967
Relax. Don't do it.

09:12.971 --> 09:16.057
I feel stupid for moving here
to be closer to him.

09:16.099 --> 09:19.018
I think you need a break.
Go out back and get some air.

09:19.018 --> 09:20.019
I'll cover your tables.

09:21.354 --> 09:22.480
You OK?

09:23.857 --> 09:25.024
You going to throw up?

09:26.234 --> 09:27.610
Come with me, man.

09:38.162 --> 09:41.166
Give me time...

09:41.207 --> 09:42.625
What?

09:44.544 --> 09:46.379
Here we go.

09:46.379 --> 09:48.173
Come on.

09:48.214 --> 09:50.550
You got it. There.

09:51.718 --> 09:52.969
Is he a friend of yours?

09:53.011 --> 09:54.179
Me? No.

09:54.220 --> 09:57.515
I couldn't let him do it
in front of his family.

09:57.557 --> 09:58.683
Wow.

09:59.893 --> 10:01.728
I'm glad I got to see it.

10:03.855 --> 10:05.940
You all through?

10:05.982 --> 10:09.527
Going to wait a few years
before you drink again?

10:09.569 --> 10:11.321
All right, remember,
alcohol equals puke...

10:11.362 --> 10:13.990
equals smelly mess
equals nobody likes you.

10:15.241 --> 10:16.826
I got it from here.

10:16.868 --> 10:19.245
Know what? You go this way,
and you go this way.

10:19.245 --> 10:22.040
It's for the best.
It's all right. Take it easy.

10:22.081 --> 10:24.292
See you later.
Sleep it off, pal.

10:24.334 --> 10:25.793
Hey, you know,
wedding singer?

10:34.093 --> 10:35.637
Are you drinking, too?

10:35.678 --> 10:38.431
No. It's Coca-cola.

10:38.473 --> 10:41.351
Are you sure? There's
no rum in that Coca-cola?

10:41.392 --> 10:43.394
I'm not a big drinker...

10:43.436 --> 10:46.564
and if it was, I'd be puking
more than that kid.

10:46.606 --> 10:48.983
I don't think anybody could
puke more than that kid.

10:49.025 --> 10:50.443
I think I saw a boot come out.

10:52.737 --> 10:54.239
You're the wedding singer.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.616
How you doing? I'm Robbie.

10:56.616 --> 10:58.159
I'm Julia.

10:58.201 --> 11:00.495
I'm actually waitressing
at your wedding next week.

11:00.537 --> 11:03.331
Cool. That's a beautiful ring
you have there.

11:03.373 --> 11:04.582
Are you getting married, too?

11:07.460 --> 11:09.671
Actually, I don't know
how serious the guy is...

11:09.712 --> 11:11.756
who gave this to me.

11:11.798 --> 11:16.469
I feel like I'm doomed to wander
the planet alone forever.

11:16.511 --> 11:20.014
Like the Incredible Hulk?

11:20.056 --> 11:24.310
Yeah...only
I'm not helping people.

11:24.352 --> 11:27.188
That's not true,
because I saw you inside.

11:27.230 --> 11:28.773
You were helping people.

11:28.815 --> 11:31.860
You were giving them
fish and coffee and forks.

11:31.901 --> 11:33.444
People can't eat without forks.

11:33.486 --> 11:35.697
And they can't
drink without a fish.

11:35.738 --> 11:38.449
That's right.
What does that mean?

11:38.491 --> 11:41.286
I don't know.
You lost me back at the Hulk.

11:42.453 --> 11:43.955
Robbie, you better
get back in there.

11:43.997 --> 11:45.623
They're starting
to turn on George.

11:45.665 --> 11:47.709
-Sit down!
-You suck!

11:50.128 --> 11:52.630
He's got to learn a new song.

11:52.672 --> 11:54.799
But it was nice to meet you.

11:54.841 --> 11:56.176
It was nice meeting you, too.

11:56.217 --> 11:59.345
And if I ever get married,
maybe you'll sing at my wedding.

11:59.387 --> 12:01.097
Oh, man. It's a deal.

12:01.139 --> 12:02.515
Take care.

12:05.685 --> 12:09.063
There was love...

12:09.105 --> 12:11.649
All around...

12:11.691 --> 12:13.484
But I never...

12:13.526 --> 12:15.987
Heard it singing.

12:16.029 --> 12:17.363
Very nice.

12:17.363 --> 12:19.449
No, I never...

12:19.490 --> 12:21.534
Heard it at all...

12:21.576 --> 12:22.535
Pretty.

12:22.577 --> 12:26.539
'Til there was you.

12:26.539 --> 12:27.832
Much better.

12:27.874 --> 12:29.417
You're going
to blow everybody away...

12:29.459 --> 12:31.002
at your fiftieth
anniversary party.

12:31.044 --> 12:35.256
If I sing to Frank
without making any mistakes...

12:35.298 --> 12:37.258
he would know
how hard I've worked...

12:37.300 --> 12:40.845
and how much I still love him
after all these years.

12:40.887 --> 12:42.680
I hope 50 years from now...

12:42.722 --> 12:44.724
Linda and I are as happy
as you two guys.

12:44.766 --> 12:47.977
You will be.
It runs in your family.

12:48.019 --> 12:51.564
You're a born romantic,
just like your father was.

12:51.606 --> 12:54.776
I know they'll be
looking down on you tomorrow.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.236
I hope so.

12:56.236 --> 12:57.654
Are you nervous?

12:57.695 --> 12:59.405
I'm actually not
that nervous, you know?

12:59.447 --> 13:01.741
I'm at weddings all the time.
It's going to be fun.

13:01.741 --> 13:05.537
Not about the wedding--
about the wedding night.

13:05.578 --> 13:08.414
Will this be your first time
with intercourse?

13:10.208 --> 13:11.751
Don't be ashamed.

13:11.793 --> 13:15.380
When I got married,
I wasn't a virgin.

13:15.421 --> 13:18.633
I already had intercourse
with eight men.

13:18.675 --> 13:22.387
That's actually something
I don't want to know about.

13:22.428 --> 13:26.432
That was a lot back then.
That would be like 200 today.

13:27.767 --> 13:29.686
It's 5:00.
I'm going to get going.

13:29.727 --> 13:31.396
But your payment.

13:31.437 --> 13:34.190
My payment.
Can I get it to go?

13:34.232 --> 13:36.484
You're such a sweet boy...

13:36.526 --> 13:39.529
letting an old woman
pay you with meatballs.

13:39.571 --> 13:42.949
They taste so good,
it's like I'm ripping you off.

13:42.949 --> 13:46.286
I don't have
any clean Tupperware.

13:46.286 --> 13:48.621
All right,
definitely next time.

13:48.663 --> 13:51.040
Don't be silly.
Now hold out your hands.

13:51.082 --> 13:53.334
-You want to--
-Do it.

13:57.046 --> 13:58.590
Cool.

13:58.631 --> 13:59.924
Thanks a lot.

14:03.303 --> 14:06.014
Now, please, take a bite...

14:06.055 --> 14:08.099
so that I can
watch you enjoy.

14:08.141 --> 14:10.018
That's my favorite part.

14:10.059 --> 14:13.062
Well...
I'll go with the right one.

14:13.104 --> 14:14.105
That looks good.

14:19.777 --> 14:21.988
That's a good meatball.

14:22.030 --> 14:26.868
Now, listen to me, Robbie Hart.

14:26.910 --> 14:30.079
You're going to be
a fine husband.

14:30.121 --> 14:32.707
I hope so, Rosie. Thank you.

14:32.749 --> 14:34.167
I'm going to leave.

14:34.209 --> 14:35.502
I'll see you
at the wedding, all right?

14:45.845 --> 14:48.389
Thank you for coming in
and taking me to lunch.

14:48.431 --> 14:51.059
Look at the picture
of that girl. See that?

14:51.100 --> 14:53.937
You're a lot prettier
than that girl...

14:53.978 --> 14:55.355
and she's getting married.

14:55.355 --> 14:58.191
What does pretty have to do
with getting married?

14:58.233 --> 15:00.235
Everything.
You got to get married...

15:00.276 --> 15:03.071
before your hips start spreading
and you get facial hair...

15:03.112 --> 15:06.157
which, by the way,
comes from your father's mother.

15:06.199 --> 15:09.202
Looks like Magnum, P.I.,
for God's sake.

15:09.244 --> 15:12.288
I can't make Glenn set a date.

15:12.330 --> 15:15.583
You're going to hate
this idea...

15:15.625 --> 15:21.047
but I think you should consider
a fake pregnancy.

15:21.089 --> 15:22.340
I'm exiting the car.

15:22.382 --> 15:23.967
It's just a means to an end.

15:24.008 --> 15:26.302
ln five years,
he'll thank you for it.

15:45.071 --> 15:46.406
Perhaps we should call her.

15:48.366 --> 15:51.035
She's probably got
a make-up problem or her dress.

15:51.077 --> 15:53.788
I know her.
She likes to look her best.

16:08.511 --> 16:10.013
Hey, sis.

16:10.054 --> 16:11.264
Hi, Robs.

16:11.306 --> 16:14.392
I just got off the phone
with Linda's mom.

16:14.434 --> 16:17.103
Linda's not there, but...

16:17.145 --> 16:18.271
there was a note.

16:18.313 --> 16:19.814
A note?

16:20.940 --> 16:22.567
Everything all right?

16:22.609 --> 16:25.069
Yeah, she's OK.

16:25.111 --> 16:27.530
It basically indicated...

16:27.572 --> 16:30.658
that Linda was...

16:30.700 --> 16:32.619
not coming today.

16:36.664 --> 16:39.167
So, it was a bad note.

16:40.502 --> 16:42.587
Did she say why?

16:46.090 --> 16:48.092
I am so sorry, honey.

16:49.135 --> 16:50.220
It's OK.

16:51.471 --> 16:52.972
You want me to say something?

16:55.934 --> 16:58.853
Just give me a second.
I'll be right back.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.982
Oh, my God,
she's not showing up.

17:15.036 --> 17:18.122
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

17:18.164 --> 17:19.790
It's OK.

17:25.964 --> 17:27.464
Oh, God!

17:37.684 --> 17:39.811
You can't catch me!

17:39.853 --> 17:42.647
I'm going to get you
and chop you up!

17:42.689 --> 17:45.316
Can we turn this crap off,
please?

17:45.358 --> 17:48.319
That's right, Robbie.
You have to let it out.

17:48.361 --> 17:50.572
-Let what out?
-Your feelings.

17:50.613 --> 17:53.324
About what that lousy bitch
did to you today.

17:53.366 --> 17:54.409
Don't call her that...

17:54.450 --> 17:55.785
because we're going
to get back together...

17:55.827 --> 17:57.787
and then there will be weirdness
between you and me...

17:57.829 --> 17:59.914
so just watch it.

17:59.956 --> 18:02.083
I made this for you,
Uncle Robbie.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.377
Thanks, Freddy Krueger.

18:04.419 --> 18:06.713
That's not nice.

18:06.754 --> 18:08.882
Very creative, though.

18:08.923 --> 18:10.466
Go back to the boiler room.

18:12.218 --> 18:14.554
I just wish I knew
where she was, you know?

18:18.349 --> 18:19.893
He's taking it pretty bad.

18:19.934 --> 18:22.061
He's acting like a real robot...

18:22.103 --> 18:23.897
a zombie or something.

18:23.897 --> 18:26.816
He's been wanting to get married
since the third grade.

18:26.858 --> 18:29.527
It makes sense.
That's when Mom and Dad died.

18:29.569 --> 18:32.071
He wants to start
a family of his own.

18:32.071 --> 18:33.615
Check out the cake.

18:33.656 --> 18:36.409
There's only
a little groom on top.

18:56.387 --> 18:57.597
You're late.

18:57.639 --> 18:59.933
I'm sorry.

18:59.933 --> 19:01.559
I just couldn't do it.

19:03.895 --> 19:06.773
If you need some more time,
I guess I can wait.

19:08.441 --> 19:11.319
No, I don't need
more time, Robbie.

19:11.361 --> 19:12.737
I don't ever want to marry you.

19:17.283 --> 19:18.660
You know, that information...

19:18.701 --> 19:22.038
might have been a little
more useful to me yesterday.

19:23.957 --> 19:25.959
I've been talking to my friends
the last couple of days...

19:26.000 --> 19:27.794
Here it comes.

19:27.836 --> 19:31.422
And I think I figured out
what's been bothering me.

19:31.464 --> 19:33.591
I'm not in love with Robbie now.

19:33.633 --> 19:37.220
I'm in love with Robbie
six years ago...

19:37.262 --> 19:39.430
Robbie, the lead singer
of Final Warning...

19:39.472 --> 19:41.432
when I used to come and
watch you from the front row...

19:41.474 --> 19:43.601
in your spandex pants...

19:43.643 --> 19:45.770
your silk shirt unbuttoned...

19:47.146 --> 19:49.858
licking the microphone
like David Lee Roth.

19:49.899 --> 19:52.318
I still got the spandex.
I'll put them on right now.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.237
The point is,
I woke up this morning...

19:54.279 --> 19:57.615
and I realized I'm about
to marry a wedding singer.

19:57.657 --> 20:00.118
I am never going
to leave Ridgefield.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.078
Why do you need
to leave Ridgefield?

20:02.120 --> 20:05.165
We grew up here.
All our friends are here.

20:05.206 --> 20:07.333
It's the perfect place
to raise a family.

20:07.375 --> 20:09.878
Living in your sister's
basement with five kids...

20:09.919 --> 20:11.713
while you're off every
weekend doing wedding gigs...

20:11.754 --> 20:13.673
at a whopping 60 bucks a pop?

20:13.715 --> 20:15.216
Once again...

20:15.258 --> 20:17.177
things that could have been
brought to my attention...

20:17.177 --> 20:18.303
yesterday!

20:21.181 --> 20:23.433
The fact is,
we grew apart a long time ago.

20:24.601 --> 20:27.020
You wanted to get married.
You didn't care to who.

20:27.061 --> 20:30.273
That's not true. I love you.
Come here.

20:30.315 --> 20:33.818
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

20:33.860 --> 20:36.279
Hey, Linda.

20:36.321 --> 20:38.323
You're a bitch.

20:41.493 --> 20:44.037
Thanks, Petey.
Go back to the house.

20:46.956 --> 20:49.250
He might have
Tourette's syndrome.

20:49.292 --> 20:50.668
We're looking into it.

20:53.171 --> 20:54.464
I got to go.

20:57.550 --> 20:58.676
I'm sorry.

21:13.942 --> 21:16.486
Ninety-nine Luftballons...

21:19.531 --> 21:20.698
Glenn!

21:20.740 --> 21:22.951
Don't be so jumpy.

21:22.992 --> 21:25.203
These are for you.

21:25.245 --> 21:26.704
Thank you.

21:28.623 --> 21:30.708
They're beautiful.

21:32.168 --> 21:34.337
I have something else for you.

21:38.675 --> 21:41.636
Two airplane tickets
to Las Vegas?

21:45.515 --> 21:47.559
Oh, my God, Glenn!

21:49.227 --> 21:50.395
I know you wanted
to set a date...

21:50.436 --> 21:52.564
so I went to the travel agent
and set it.

21:53.940 --> 21:56.192
Glenn, I love you so much...

21:56.234 --> 21:57.360
but Las Vegas? I thought--

21:57.402 --> 21:59.445
Jules, it's the romance
capital of the world.

21:59.487 --> 22:02.073
I just don't want
a big wedding--

22:02.115 --> 22:03.783
hundreds of people
we don't know...

22:03.825 --> 22:05.827
that are just there
for the free drinks...

22:05.869 --> 22:07.912
and all-you-can-eat buffet.

22:07.954 --> 22:09.956
They might as well be in Vegas.

22:16.421 --> 22:19.549
Las Vegas it is,
and it'll be great.

22:21.301 --> 22:23.136
Are you going to do
the girl thing?

22:23.178 --> 22:26.472
You're going to act happy
and be pouting on the inside?

22:27.974 --> 22:29.642
I'm happy.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.815
All right.

22:35.815 --> 22:37.483
Let's get married here.

22:37.525 --> 22:40.403
I know that's what you want.

22:40.445 --> 22:42.322
Thank you, Glenn.

22:43.656 --> 22:45.158
It's more important
to you anyway.

22:46.659 --> 22:49.287
I promise I will give you
the most beautiful wedding...

22:49.329 --> 22:51.331
and even you'll have
a good time.

23:15.647 --> 23:18.149
It's about time
his best friend showed up.

23:18.191 --> 23:19.943
So, how's he doing?

23:19.984 --> 23:21.402
I don't know.

23:21.444 --> 23:24.489
He's been down in the basement
since it happened.

23:24.531 --> 23:26.533
Five days now.

23:26.533 --> 23:30.745
I think he's having some kind
of a mental situation...

23:30.787 --> 23:33.289
an episode or something.

23:33.331 --> 23:34.749
All right.

23:37.210 --> 23:39.170
You do something, because
I don't want to be known...

23:39.212 --> 23:41.464
as the brother-in-law
of the town nut job.

23:41.506 --> 23:42.924
I got enough problems already.

23:42.966 --> 23:45.134
Shit,
I got water all over myself.

23:53.935 --> 23:55.436
Hello?

24:00.817 --> 24:02.485
You all right?

24:10.160 --> 24:13.037
These sheets are soft.
You use Downy?

24:15.081 --> 24:17.417
All Tempa-Cheer.

24:17.417 --> 24:19.419
You can wash your clothes
at any temperature...

24:19.419 --> 24:21.421
and the colors
don't run together.

24:21.421 --> 24:24.674
-Really?
-Yeah. Now leave me alone.

24:26.259 --> 24:28.344
You have to go back to work.

24:28.386 --> 24:31.598
There's going to be over
a hundred drunk girls...

24:31.639 --> 24:32.765
at this wedding tonight.

24:32.807 --> 24:34.350
I've got nothing
to offer anybody.

24:34.392 --> 24:37.687
I haven't done jack shit
since high school.

24:37.729 --> 24:39.731
Why would any girl
ever marry me?

24:39.772 --> 24:41.482
Marry you?

24:41.524 --> 24:43.526
I'm just trying to get someone
to play with your ding-dong.

24:47.864 --> 24:49.949
Holiday...

24:52.118 --> 24:54.370
Celebrate...

25:05.340 --> 25:08.301
If we took a holiday...

25:09.677 --> 25:12.013
Took some time to celebrate...

25:12.055 --> 25:13.973
Come on, let's celebrate.

25:14.015 --> 25:16.559
Just one day out of life...

25:18.228 --> 25:20.438
It would be...

25:20.480 --> 25:23.816
It would be so nice.

25:23.816 --> 25:27.403
Everybody spread the word.

25:27.445 --> 25:31.741
I live in
my sister's basement.

25:32.909 --> 25:35.078
He just had his heart broken.

25:35.119 --> 25:37.914
Why would he even think
about coming back to work?

25:37.956 --> 25:39.582
I don't know.

25:39.624 --> 25:42.252
Celebrate.

25:53.429 --> 25:55.974
You guys are off
to a great start.

25:56.015 --> 25:57.517
I mean...

25:57.559 --> 26:00.228
Cindy showed up,
so, right away, Scott...

26:00.270 --> 26:01.688
you got to be pretty psyched.

26:03.106 --> 26:05.650
I'm not paying you to hear
your thoughts on life.

26:05.692 --> 26:07.026
I'm paying you to sing.

26:08.695 --> 26:12.198
I have a microphone,
and you don't...

26:12.240 --> 26:15.160
so you will listen
to every damn word...

26:15.201 --> 26:16.953
I have to say!

26:23.877 --> 26:28.339
It's funny. Some of us
will never find true love.

26:28.381 --> 26:32.135
Like, take, for instance...me.

26:33.344 --> 26:35.305
And I'm pretty sure
that guy right there.

26:37.473 --> 26:39.726
And that lady
with the sideburns.

26:41.603 --> 26:44.189
And basically
everybody at table nine.

26:45.607 --> 26:47.901
But the worst thing is...

26:47.901 --> 26:53.907
that me, fatty,
sideburns lady...

26:53.948 --> 26:55.742
and the mutants
over at table nine...

26:57.785 --> 27:01.080
will never, ever find a way
to better the situation...

27:01.080 --> 27:03.208
because...

27:03.249 --> 27:06.920
apparently, we have
absolutely nothing to offer...

27:06.961 --> 27:08.505
the opposite sex.

27:10.131 --> 27:12.592
You are the worst wedding singer
in the world, buddy!

27:12.634 --> 27:14.719
Sir, one more outburst...

27:14.761 --> 27:17.138
I will strangle you
with my microphone wire.

27:20.016 --> 27:21.809
Let's cut the stupid cake...

27:21.851 --> 27:23.770
because the fat guy's
going to have a heart attack...

27:23.811 --> 27:25.188
if we don't eat again soon.

27:27.524 --> 27:31.319
And while we do that,
here's a little mood music.

27:38.785 --> 27:41.412
Cindy and Scott are newlyweds.

27:47.168 --> 27:49.587
He loves her...

27:49.629 --> 27:52.257
But she loves
this guy right here...

27:52.298 --> 27:54.926
And he loves somebody else.

27:54.968 --> 27:57.887
You just can't win.

27:57.929 --> 27:59.889
And so it goes...

27:59.931 --> 28:02.851
Until the day you die.

28:02.892 --> 28:05.353
This thing they call love...

28:05.395 --> 28:07.647
Is gonna make you cry.

28:07.689 --> 28:08.857
I hate you.

28:08.898 --> 28:10.942
I've had the blues...

28:10.984 --> 28:13.778
The reds and the pinks.

28:13.820 --> 28:16.447
One thing's for sure...

28:17.490 --> 28:18.491
Love stinks?

28:18.491 --> 28:20.118
Love stinks.

28:42.056 --> 28:44.475
Drug addict! Degenerate!

29:12.837 --> 29:15.840
I was wondering
what happened to you.

29:17.759 --> 29:19.677
Did everybody leave?

29:20.887 --> 29:23.223
Pretty much,
except for a few cops...

29:23.264 --> 29:25.850
that are still interviewing
some witnesses.

29:30.647 --> 29:32.815
I'm going to get
the hell out of here.

29:34.984 --> 29:36.569
So it was
your first wedding back.

29:36.611 --> 29:38.947
Of course things are going
to be a little shaky.

29:38.988 --> 29:41.533
A little shaky?
I hate weddings.

29:41.574 --> 29:44.786
I hate the bride.
I hate the groom.

29:44.828 --> 29:47.872
I want them to be miserable,
because that's what I am.

29:47.914 --> 29:49.916
No. You're the best.

29:49.916 --> 29:53.503
At what? People eat
prime rib, and I sing.

29:53.545 --> 29:57.048
It's a joke.
I can't do this anymore.

29:58.049 --> 30:00.927
Glenn and I set the date...

30:00.969 --> 30:02.929
so you have to play our wedding.

30:05.056 --> 30:06.558
Congratulations.

30:07.809 --> 30:11.896
I just can't do it, all right?

30:12.939 --> 30:15.400
I'm having an engagement party
in two weeks...

30:15.441 --> 30:17.652
and I really want
you and Sammy to come.

30:39.174 --> 30:41.176
Good, you're here.

30:41.217 --> 30:43.678
Robbie's here!
Let's move it!

30:43.720 --> 30:45.597
The kids have been fed,
but if they want snacks...

30:45.638 --> 30:48.975
there's ice pops in the freezer,
or microwave popcorn.

30:48.975 --> 30:50.310
Good.

30:50.351 --> 30:51.936
Are you going
to the engagement party?

30:51.978 --> 30:53.771
Yeah, I'll probably go.

30:55.148 --> 30:57.483
Come on, Andy, move your ass!

30:57.483 --> 30:59.444
Hang on. I'm watching Dallas.

30:59.485 --> 31:01.946
I think J.R. might be dead.
They shot him.

31:01.988 --> 31:02.947
Good night.

31:02.989 --> 31:04.991
-Love you.
-Love you.

31:05.033 --> 31:07.118
Time to make the donuts.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.286
I made the donuts.

31:08.328 --> 31:11.164
Dunkin' donuts--
up to 52 varieties...

31:11.206 --> 31:12.999
Uncle Robbie's here.

31:14.834 --> 31:17.629
Hey, the Goofball Brothers.

31:17.670 --> 31:20.298
ls it true you're in the middle
of a nervous breakdown?

31:23.301 --> 31:26.471
-Who said that?
-Everybody.

31:26.513 --> 31:28.848
You're eight years old.
You only know your parents.

31:28.848 --> 31:30.141
What are you talking about?

31:30.183 --> 31:32.936
Is it true you're gonna end up
in a mental institution?

31:32.977 --> 31:35.104
Cuckoo's nest!

31:36.272 --> 31:37.565
Hey, kids.

31:39.776 --> 31:41.611
Remember what we talked about?

31:43.947 --> 31:45.782
Go over there
and watch some television.

31:45.824 --> 31:47.700
Can I speak to you for a second?

31:47.700 --> 31:49.327
Everybody...

31:52.205 --> 31:54.207
I've been thinking
about what happened to you...

31:54.249 --> 31:55.708
and it's all for the best.

31:55.750 --> 31:58.336
I know you were
in love and everything...

31:58.378 --> 31:59.462
but that wears off.

31:59.504 --> 32:02.924
Me and your sister,
we used to be wild.

32:02.966 --> 32:05.009
She was very adventurous...

32:05.051 --> 32:07.971
and we got into some crazy shit.

32:08.012 --> 32:09.681
But now the thrill is gone.

32:09.722 --> 32:13.017
If we get a second alone,
we usually go to sleep.

32:13.059 --> 32:15.645
If it's a special occasion...

32:15.687 --> 32:18.523
she might do
this exotic dance for me.

32:18.565 --> 32:20.024
What?

32:20.066 --> 32:23.486
Sometimes she might
work with my nipples a bit.

32:23.528 --> 32:25.280
All right, enough. Go out.

32:25.321 --> 32:27.157
I'll take care of the kids.

32:28.408 --> 32:31.411
I don't know what I just said,
but I said something.

32:39.878 --> 32:41.504
Women got a thing
about marriage.

32:41.546 --> 32:45.800
If you want to stay with them,
you're gonna have to marry them.

32:45.842 --> 32:48.094
No big deal. There she is.

32:48.136 --> 32:50.513
The girl who finally beat me
into submission.

32:50.555 --> 32:51.681
That's right.

32:51.723 --> 32:54.017
August 5th
is less than three months away.

32:54.058 --> 32:56.186
We've got a lot of planning
to do.

32:56.227 --> 32:58.229
Do you think
it would be better...

32:58.271 --> 33:01.107
if maybe you took over
all the arrangements?

33:01.107 --> 33:04.569
I'd like to do it together.

33:04.611 --> 33:07.822
Yeah, but you like this stuff.

33:07.864 --> 33:09.365
It's really not my thing.

33:10.909 --> 33:13.453
God forbid I screw up
the wedding flowers.

33:13.495 --> 33:14.871
How could I live with myself?

33:14.913 --> 33:16.080
He'll be so wasted...

33:16.122 --> 33:19.292
he won't know flowers
are at the wedding.

33:21.961 --> 33:24.214
I hear you're gonna have
your bachelor party Friday.

33:24.255 --> 33:28.426
Gonna be all right with that?
You might miss Miami Vice.

33:28.468 --> 33:31.930
Nope. Summer. Reruns.
I'm all set.

33:31.971 --> 33:34.390
Great.

33:37.310 --> 33:39.562
All right, nice house.

33:39.604 --> 33:42.607
I told you this guy was loaded.

33:42.649 --> 33:45.985
I know. In and out, though.
I don't want to be here long.

33:45.985 --> 33:48.655
Let me just pick up a chick,
and we'll get out of here.

33:48.696 --> 33:50.448
What do you think
of the jacket?

33:50.490 --> 33:54.118
I would lose that glove.
You look nuts.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.287
There's Julia.

33:57.956 --> 34:00.041
Let's go say hello.

34:01.334 --> 34:03.461
Hi, you guys.

34:03.503 --> 34:05.213
I'm so glad you came.

34:05.255 --> 34:07.507
Jason,
this is Robbie and Sammy...

34:07.549 --> 34:10.009
and this is my fiance Glenn.

34:10.051 --> 34:12.303
-Congratulations, Glenn.
-Thank you.

34:12.344 --> 34:13.471
Robbie Hart.

34:13.513 --> 34:17.266
I heard what happened
to you at your wedding.

34:17.308 --> 34:20.311
That was so cold.
You must have felt like shit.

34:20.353 --> 34:24.607
No. It felt really good.
Thanks for bringing it up.

34:24.649 --> 34:27.527
My parents died when I was 10.
Want to talk about that?

34:27.527 --> 34:29.696
Why would we want
to talk about that?

34:29.737 --> 34:31.197
I don't know.

34:31.197 --> 34:32.824
Somebody needs a drink.

34:32.866 --> 34:35.034
Actually,
I'm not a big drinker.

34:35.076 --> 34:36.870
I am.
How about an Alabama Slammer?

34:36.911 --> 34:38.036
Sounds like a plan.

34:38.079 --> 34:40.039
Meet me at the bar.
I gotta piss first.

34:40.039 --> 34:42.333
Have a few drinks
and drive home.

34:44.543 --> 34:46.838
Julia, thanks for inviting us.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.716
I'm glad you guys came.
We hang out at work so much...

34:49.716 --> 34:51.967
but we don't get to talk
'cause we're always so busy.

34:53.678 --> 34:55.847
We should make time to talk,
don't you think?

34:58.349 --> 35:01.603
Know what? The first time
this guy saw you...

35:01.644 --> 35:03.897
he told me
he was gonna hit on you.

35:03.938 --> 35:06.524
-Really?
-That's not true.

35:06.566 --> 35:09.360
Yeah, it is.
You told me she was in trouble.

35:09.402 --> 35:12.197
She was gonna get it,
and she didn't even know it.

35:12.238 --> 35:14.199
He's teasing.
I would never say that.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.868
You said you were
gonna give it to her.

35:16.910 --> 35:18.870
Give me what, exactly?

35:18.912 --> 35:20.455
You're a jerk.

35:20.497 --> 35:22.916
What do you mean?
You didn't know she was engaged.

35:22.916 --> 35:24.834
So now you're not
gonna give it to me?

35:24.876 --> 35:26.544
Very funny.

35:26.586 --> 35:28.046
Say hi to your brother Tito.

35:32.926 --> 35:34.886
So how are you doing?

35:34.928 --> 35:37.972
I'm doing better. I don't know.

35:38.014 --> 35:40.433
How are you and Glenn doing
with the wedding plans?

35:43.228 --> 35:46.606
Glenn isn't really--
He's very busy right now.

35:46.648 --> 35:50.735
He works on Wall Street.
You know how that is nowadays.

35:50.777 --> 35:53.780
Wall Street--stocks and stuff?

35:53.780 --> 35:54.906
Actually, he's in bonds.

35:54.948 --> 35:58.368
He barely has time to sleep,
let alone plan a wedding...

35:58.409 --> 36:00.078
so I'm kind of doing this
on my own.

36:00.119 --> 36:03.164
But I went to Marshall's
for the floral centerpieces.

36:03.206 --> 36:05.667
Marshall's?
You should go to Tony's.

36:05.708 --> 36:08.378
They're cheaper, and
they've got a great selection.

36:08.419 --> 36:11.422
All right.
Well, thank you for the tip.

36:11.464 --> 36:13.758
It's a shame you won't be
doing weddings anymore.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.134
We won't get
to hang out as much.

36:15.176 --> 36:17.554
We'll get to hang out.

36:17.595 --> 36:20.974
There's other things to do
besides weddings, right?

36:22.809 --> 36:25.270
Oy, oy, bar mitzvah...

36:25.311 --> 36:27.438
Mazel tov...

36:47.167 --> 36:48.293
L'chaim !

36:48.334 --> 36:51.504
Let's keep the fun rolling.
Take it away, George.

37:04.601 --> 37:07.812
Do you really want to hurt me?

37:11.024 --> 37:12.442
You seem kind of sad.

37:12.483 --> 37:14.152
Why don't you
get out there and dance?

37:14.194 --> 37:17.572
I asked that girl over there.
She turned me down.

37:17.614 --> 37:20.533
She said she didn't dance
with losers.

37:20.575 --> 37:23.286
Man. That hurts.

37:23.328 --> 37:26.206
But why would you want
to dance with somebody...

37:26.206 --> 37:28.875
who doesn't want
to dance with you? Right?

37:30.168 --> 37:32.003
Listen, don't worry.

37:32.045 --> 37:34.631
You're gonna meet a girl
who treats you right someday.

37:34.672 --> 37:36.007
I promise you.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.677
How you guys doing?
All right?

37:39.719 --> 37:41.846
I want you to meet
a friend of mine...

37:41.888 --> 37:43.681
by the name of Julia Sullivan.

37:45.016 --> 37:47.477
Could you come out here
for a second?

37:48.853 --> 37:50.021
Say hi to Julia, everybody.

37:50.063 --> 37:51.105
Hello.

37:51.147 --> 37:54.359
Now, who of you out there
would like to dance...

37:54.400 --> 37:55.902
with this fine-looking woman?

37:59.113 --> 38:02.158
I'd like to do more
than dance with her.

38:03.535 --> 38:05.203
Wow, Julia.

38:05.245 --> 38:07.288
Sounds to me
like you got your pick...

38:07.330 --> 38:09.332
of any man in this room
to dance with...

38:09.374 --> 38:12.377
so I want you
to take your time...

38:12.418 --> 38:16.214
and find amongst all these
young studs here tonight...

38:16.256 --> 38:19.467
the coolest, most un-losery guy
in the bunch.

38:21.094 --> 38:22.595
Pick me.

38:24.889 --> 38:26.099
Please pick me.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.112
May I have this dance?

38:44.284 --> 38:46.327
OK, pal, have fun.

38:53.668 --> 38:57.255
I can only give you love...

38:57.297 --> 38:59.424
That lasts forever...

38:59.465 --> 39:03.094
And a promise to be near...

39:03.136 --> 39:06.389
Each time you call...

39:06.431 --> 39:10.643
And the only heart I own...

39:10.685 --> 39:13.688
For you and you alone...

39:13.730 --> 39:15.190
That's all.

39:18.818 --> 39:22.697
All I have are these arms...

39:22.739 --> 39:26.284
To enfold you.
Just go with it.

39:26.326 --> 39:31.664
And a love
time can never destroy.

39:31.706 --> 39:33.583
Take it, George.

40:06.491 --> 40:07.450
Come here, Big Red.

40:11.871 --> 40:14.833
If you're wondering
what I'm asking...

40:14.874 --> 40:17.794
In return, dear...

40:17.836 --> 40:19.546
You'll be glad to know...

40:19.587 --> 40:24.926
That my demands are small.

40:24.968 --> 40:29.514
Say it's me
that you'll adore...

40:29.556 --> 40:31.891
For now and ever more.

40:31.933 --> 40:33.893
That's all.

40:39.566 --> 40:42.193
To the new lord of the ladies!

40:43.403 --> 40:45.780
You're a lovely dancer.

40:52.245 --> 40:54.747
-Are you gonna tell Glenn?
-About what?

40:54.747 --> 40:57.584
About you and that kid
and him squeezing your tush?

40:57.625 --> 41:01.087
He did have very strong
hands for a 13-year-old.

41:01.087 --> 41:02.255
I could see that.

41:02.297 --> 41:05.800
By the way, thank you for
recommending Tony the florist.

41:05.842 --> 41:08.094
His flowers were beautiful,
and he didn't overcharge me.

41:08.136 --> 41:10.054
Good. I'm glad.

41:10.096 --> 41:11.347
And a new girl in town...

41:11.389 --> 41:13.558
could certainly use that kind
of help on everything.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.768
You got Holly
and your mother, right?

41:15.810 --> 41:19.022
My mother lives 50 miles away...

41:19.063 --> 41:20.815
and Holly's
not into that kind of thing...

41:20.857 --> 41:23.026
so that really only leaves
one person.

41:29.073 --> 41:33.077
I would, but, you know,
I just--l can't.

41:33.119 --> 41:34.787
I understand.

41:34.829 --> 41:37.123
I just don't know
how to go about this.

41:37.165 --> 41:40.793
I'm afraid I'm gonna pay $500
for a half-eaten wedding cake.

41:40.835 --> 41:44.589
I really gotta concentrate
on getting some more gigs.

41:44.631 --> 41:47.258
There's only four Jewish
families in this town.

41:53.014 --> 41:54.641
All right.

41:57.602 --> 42:01.231
I have never done it
for that cheap.

42:01.272 --> 42:04.651
I know for a fact you gave
Eric Lamensoft that price.

42:04.651 --> 42:06.903
I did not.

42:06.945 --> 42:09.113
Faye, look at me.

42:09.155 --> 42:12.367
Look me in the eyes.
I'm right here.

42:12.408 --> 42:15.453
Don't look away. Did you
give him that price or not?

42:18.790 --> 42:22.460
OK. Just that one time.
So you got me.

42:22.502 --> 42:24.838
Can I say something?

42:24.879 --> 42:28.466
I deal with a lot of people,
but you two look truly happy.

42:28.508 --> 42:31.386
You're gonna make it.
I know. Believe me.

42:31.427 --> 42:32.428
How do you know?

42:32.470 --> 42:34.889
You can just look at a couple...

42:34.931 --> 42:36.766
and you can tell right away...

42:36.808 --> 42:39.394
they're gonna
stay together forever.

42:39.435 --> 42:42.355
Like Donald and Ivana...

42:42.397 --> 42:44.983
and Woody and Mia...

42:45.024 --> 42:48.444
and Burt and Loni.

42:48.486 --> 42:50.029
We're not getting married.

42:50.071 --> 42:53.074
That's right. Actually,
we're brother and sister.

42:53.116 --> 42:56.661
So that's it.
I could sense a closeness.

42:56.703 --> 42:58.788
The weird thing is,
when we were growing up...

42:58.830 --> 43:01.583
we didn't get along 'cause
I used to do this to her.

43:07.213 --> 43:09.507
We're gonna go now.
Come here, sis.

43:09.549 --> 43:11.926
Your ass is grass.

43:11.968 --> 43:14.012
I'm telling Mom
when we get home.

43:18.725 --> 43:20.518
Yes, it's ladies' night...

43:20.560 --> 43:22.645
And the feeling's right.

43:22.687 --> 43:24.397
Yes, it's ladies' night.

43:24.439 --> 43:25.982
Oh, what a...

43:26.024 --> 43:26.983
Oh, what a night.

43:27.066 --> 43:28.693
Yes, it's ladies' night...

43:28.735 --> 43:30.403
And the feeling's right.

43:30.445 --> 43:33.323
I've never seen it from
this perspective before.

43:33.364 --> 43:34.782
Is this what I look like?

43:34.824 --> 43:37.452
No. You're much better
than him.

43:37.494 --> 43:39.204
He's ridiculous.

43:39.245 --> 43:40.205
One...

43:44.125 --> 43:46.461
Romantic lady...

43:47.962 --> 43:50.840
Single baby...

43:52.217 --> 43:55.845
Sophisticated mama...

43:55.887 --> 44:00.558
Come on, you disco lady.

44:00.600 --> 44:01.851
Send me a line, mama.

44:01.893 --> 44:03.561
Yes, it's ladies' night.

44:03.603 --> 44:05.021
Oh, what a night!

44:06.022 --> 44:07.732
Chaka Khan!

44:07.774 --> 44:09.901
Thank you.
This is Jimmy Moore...

44:09.943 --> 44:12.487
saying that ain't
no sock in my crotch.

44:12.529 --> 44:14.864
Take four, everybody.

44:14.906 --> 44:16.908
Jimmy, that was really good.
Thank you.

44:16.950 --> 44:18.034
No. Thank you.

44:18.076 --> 44:21.246
-For what?
-For quitting.

44:21.287 --> 44:25.083
Or...should I thank Linda?

44:25.124 --> 44:27.836
My business has tripled.

44:29.128 --> 44:33.842
You've just inspired
me to hire a D.J...

44:33.883 --> 44:35.593
so thank you.

44:38.888 --> 44:43.685
Good luck finding a D.J. who can
move and shake like this.

44:49.899 --> 44:52.152
How did you become
a wedding singer?

44:53.403 --> 44:55.947
I think I got into it
to make some money...

44:55.989 --> 44:57.824
until my music career took off.

44:57.866 --> 45:00.076
And you wanted to be
a rock star?

45:00.118 --> 45:04.289
I kind of just wanted
to be a songwriter, you know?

45:04.330 --> 45:06.791
That's the hardest thing,
to write a song.

45:06.833 --> 45:09.961
A song that
when people hear it...

45:10.003 --> 45:12.338
they go, "Ohh, I know
what that guy was feeling...

45:12.338 --> 45:13.673
"when he wrote that."

45:13.715 --> 45:14.841
Have you written anything
lately?

45:14.883 --> 45:17.093
Yeah, I guess.

45:17.135 --> 45:18.678
Will you play it for me?

45:18.720 --> 45:20.597
You don't want to hear it.
It's not good.

45:20.638 --> 45:22.182
I'm sure it is.

45:22.223 --> 45:25.810
I wrote half of it
when I was with Linda...

45:25.852 --> 45:28.646
and I wrote the other half
after we broke up...

45:28.688 --> 45:30.648
so it's a little uneven,
you know?

45:30.690 --> 45:33.776
I don't mind.
I'd like to hear it.

45:33.818 --> 45:36.446
Yeah, all right.

45:42.827 --> 45:46.706
I just want to warn you
that when I wrote this song...

45:46.706 --> 45:49.459
I was listening
to The Cure a lot, so...

45:51.211 --> 45:52.378
Here we go.

45:54.005 --> 45:57.050
You don't know...

45:57.091 --> 45:59.010
How much...

45:59.052 --> 46:01.513
I need you.

46:01.554 --> 46:06.226
While you're near me...

46:06.267 --> 46:09.354
I don't feel blue.

46:10.522 --> 46:13.733
And when we kiss...

46:13.775 --> 46:18.154
I know you need me, too.

46:18.196 --> 46:22.450
I can't believe
I found a love...

46:22.492 --> 46:26.746
That's so pure and true...

46:26.788 --> 46:30.375
But it all was bullshit.

46:30.416 --> 46:34.879
It was a goddamn joke...

46:34.921 --> 46:39.342
And when
I think of you, Linda...

46:39.384 --> 46:43.429
I hope you fuckin' choke.

46:43.471 --> 46:47.559
I hope you're glad...

46:47.600 --> 46:50.520
With what you've done to me.

46:51.688 --> 46:53.398
I lay in bed...

46:53.439 --> 46:55.567
All day long...

46:55.608 --> 46:58.778
Feeling melancholy.

46:58.820 --> 47:01.698
You left me here...

47:01.739 --> 47:03.658
All alone...

47:03.700 --> 47:07.537
Tears running constantly.

47:07.579 --> 47:12.083
Oh, somebody kill me, please.

47:15.962 --> 47:17.839
I'm on my knees.

47:17.881 --> 47:20.049
Pretty, pretty please.

47:20.091 --> 47:23.094
Kill me.

47:23.136 --> 47:26.723
I want to die.

47:26.764 --> 47:34.397
Put a bullet in my head.

47:35.815 --> 47:37.525
I liked it.

47:39.527 --> 47:42.113
He's losing his mind...

47:43.656 --> 47:46.367
and I'm reaping
all the benefits.

47:57.337 --> 48:01.007
Thank you for the ice cream.
It always cheers me up.

48:01.049 --> 48:03.009
It's my pleasure.

48:03.009 --> 48:04.385
I feel weird
being in this place.

48:04.427 --> 48:07.639
We came here all the time.
We used to get chocolate shakes.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.849
May I ask what happened
with Linda?

48:09.891 --> 48:14.938
She wasn't the right one,
I guess.

48:14.979 --> 48:17.649
Did you have any idea
she wasn't the right one...

48:17.690 --> 48:19.317
when you were together?

48:21.069 --> 48:22.237
I should have.

48:24.864 --> 48:26.991
I remember we went
to the Grand Canyon once.

48:27.033 --> 48:29.160
We were flying there,
and I'd never been before...

48:29.202 --> 48:32.580
and Linda had,
so you would think...

48:32.622 --> 48:34.958
that she would give me
the window seat...

48:34.999 --> 48:36.709
but she didn't.

48:36.751 --> 48:39.754
Not that that's a big deal,
you know?

48:39.796 --> 48:42.090
But there were a lot of
little things like that.

48:42.131 --> 48:44.717
-l know that sounds stupid.
-Not at all.

48:44.759 --> 48:46.719
I think it's
the little things that count.

48:46.719 --> 48:49.222
How did you know
that Glenn was the right one?

48:52.559 --> 48:54.227
The right one.

48:54.269 --> 48:57.147
I always just envisioned
the right one...

48:57.188 --> 49:00.233
being someone I could
see myself growing old with.

49:03.862 --> 49:08.032
And Glenn will be a really
good-looking older man...

49:08.074 --> 49:09.659
like Blake Carrington.

49:09.701 --> 49:11.703
I'm gonna probably
look like Buddy Hackett.

50:22.857 --> 50:24.859
Of course
I'm gonna hire him.

50:24.901 --> 50:27.278
He's your best friend and
the only limo driver in town.

50:30.365 --> 50:32.033
Yeah. I just like
having fun with him.

50:37.080 --> 50:39.249
Wow. Look at him go.

50:42.043 --> 50:43.628
Better move it, man.

50:45.296 --> 50:46.464
You're not gonna make it.

50:54.514 --> 50:57.267
You hit 2 cones.
Those could have been people.

50:57.308 --> 50:58.935
Those could have been
guests at her wedding.

51:01.062 --> 51:02.564
They were cones.

51:17.203 --> 51:19.497
That was fun today.
Wasn't that fun?

51:19.539 --> 51:21.374
That was fun.

51:21.416 --> 51:23.877
-l got the job, right?
-Yeah, you did.

51:23.877 --> 51:26.796
It's August 5th,
a week from today.

51:26.838 --> 51:29.007
Someone left a jacket
in the back.

51:29.048 --> 51:31.467
That's Julia's jacket.

51:31.509 --> 51:34.345
Remember?
She took it off on Noxon Street.

51:34.387 --> 51:36.097
She said it's not
jacket weather anymore.

51:36.139 --> 51:39.184
-Uh-oh.
-What?

51:39.225 --> 51:41.519
-You like her.
-No, I don't.

51:41.561 --> 51:44.189
Of course you do. She's
a cool chick with a hot ass.

51:44.230 --> 51:46.524
You talk about her ass again,
I'll break your neck.

51:46.566 --> 51:49.694
Anyway, she told me
she likes you.

51:49.736 --> 51:51.529
Really?

51:51.571 --> 51:52.906
She said that?

51:55.658 --> 51:56.784
Think about it.

51:56.826 --> 51:59.245
It's gonna be your first
kiss as a married couple.

51:59.245 --> 52:01.331
It's perfectly acceptable
to open your mouth.

52:01.372 --> 52:04.334
I just would not want
to do that in a church...

52:04.375 --> 52:06.961
in front of God
and all of our relatives.

52:07.003 --> 52:10.048
It would gross them out
to see me like...

52:10.089 --> 52:13.468
No one will ever solve that.

52:18.181 --> 52:20.225
You forgot
your jacket in the limo.

52:20.266 --> 52:22.393
Thank you for bringing it back.
That's so nice of you.

52:22.435 --> 52:24.187
Yeah, it was.

52:24.229 --> 52:27.148
I'll see you later, all right?
Have fun today.

52:27.190 --> 52:28.733
Hey, wait a second.

52:28.775 --> 52:32.111
Maybe...he can help us.

52:32.153 --> 52:33.446
You're the expert on this.

52:33.488 --> 52:35.448
We were just having a debate
about wedding kisses.

52:35.490 --> 52:39.077
I say that it's OK for it
to be an open-mouth kiss.

52:39.118 --> 52:41.329
And I say that it's
the type of occasion...

52:41.371 --> 52:43.373
where people dress up,
so it's not appropriate.

52:43.414 --> 52:46.209
-l see.
-What do you want to do?

52:46.251 --> 52:48.920
Thin, tight mouth,
and it's over?

52:48.962 --> 52:52.674
No. Thin, partially open.

52:52.715 --> 52:54.133
No tongues, over.

52:54.133 --> 52:57.595
No tongue? Please. There
has got to be a little.

52:57.637 --> 52:59.514
Maybe a little tongue.

52:59.556 --> 53:01.975
Not porno tongue.
Church tongue.

53:01.975 --> 53:03.768
Church tongue. I like that.

53:03.810 --> 53:05.603
Church tongue? What is that?

53:05.645 --> 53:08.439
I don't know
how to describe it.

53:08.481 --> 53:10.316
Well, show me.

53:13.611 --> 53:16.531
Not on me.
How about on him?

53:16.573 --> 53:19.742
You don't mind, do you?

53:19.784 --> 53:22.495
Come on, just hold still.
Julia, go ahead.

53:28.168 --> 53:30.253
Come on.
We're all adults here.

53:34.507 --> 53:37.760
I'm gonna have to see it
to make an educated decision.

53:40.013 --> 53:42.640
Well, if it's for
educational purposes.

53:42.682 --> 53:45.351
Good. OK.
All right, you ready?

53:45.393 --> 53:48.354
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

53:48.354 --> 53:50.690
You may kiss the bride.

54:18.051 --> 54:19.302
Wow.

54:19.344 --> 54:23.598
That...was...great.

54:23.640 --> 54:26.184
Julia, you should do that
at the wedding.

54:27.352 --> 54:30.230
I gave her the jacket.

54:30.230 --> 54:32.982
Hey, Jules. Hey, Holly.

54:34.317 --> 54:37.070
I kissed her,
but it didn't mean anything.

54:37.111 --> 54:39.572
I just brought her the jacket.

54:40.990 --> 54:41.991
Kissed who?

54:43.535 --> 54:44.911
Oh, me.

54:44.953 --> 54:46.579
Who hasn't?

54:48.832 --> 54:53.294
I got you something.
It's called a CD player.

54:53.336 --> 54:54.921
Cost me 700 bucks...

54:54.963 --> 54:57.715
but the sound quality
is outstanding.

54:57.757 --> 54:59.551
You want to play a record?

54:59.592 --> 55:03.096
Jules, it doesn't play records.
It plays CDs.

55:03.137 --> 55:05.265
It's a CD player.

55:05.306 --> 55:07.100
I'll be upstairs hooking it up.

55:07.141 --> 55:12.355
Oh, my God, Robbie
is so amazingly cute.

55:12.397 --> 55:14.816
I think
I should go out with him.

55:18.945 --> 55:20.446
Yeah, why not?

55:20.488 --> 55:23.575
You're single, and he's single.
It makes sense.

55:25.326 --> 55:27.453
If you don't want me to,
I won't do it.

55:28.955 --> 55:30.582
Why would I not want you to?

55:30.623 --> 55:32.667
Good, then I'm going out
with him.

55:32.709 --> 55:34.794
Who you going out with?

55:36.129 --> 55:38.423
Good.
That guy needs to get laid.

55:38.464 --> 55:39.841
Excuse me.

55:39.883 --> 55:42.510
Because he's going out with me
doesn't mean he'll get laid.

55:45.305 --> 55:47.557
All right, he probably will.

55:47.599 --> 55:48.933
Do you think
he'll go out with me?

55:50.226 --> 55:52.687
Jules is chums with him.
She'll fix it up, won't you?

55:52.729 --> 55:56.399
You know what would be fun?
Let's go on a double date.

56:21.132 --> 56:23.635
Robbie,
you look so cute tonight.

56:23.676 --> 56:25.220
Thank you.

56:25.261 --> 56:28.097
I like these rubber bracelets.
You look like Madonna.

56:28.139 --> 56:30.433
Yeah, that's the idea.

56:35.939 --> 56:37.232
Here you go.

56:37.273 --> 56:39.984
So, Robbie,
how's your business going?

56:40.026 --> 56:43.613
I'm actually working
on a game plan right now.

56:43.655 --> 56:45.740
You should look
into the bond market.

56:45.782 --> 56:48.034
-That's where the money is.
-Glenn's in junk bonds.

56:48.076 --> 56:51.120
No, Jules,
it's high-yield bonds.

56:51.162 --> 56:53.331
Do I tell people
you're in junk waitressing?

56:55.333 --> 56:58.586
My grandmother gave me
a savings bond when I was a kid.

56:58.628 --> 57:03.842
I get $25 in 1993,
so that'll be good.

57:05.718 --> 57:08.596
So we totally
look like a couple.

57:08.638 --> 57:10.348
Don't you think
we look great together?

57:11.558 --> 57:15.186
David Bowie playing.
He's the best.

57:15.228 --> 57:16.855
I think he's coming to town
in September.

57:16.896 --> 57:19.190
I love David Bowie.

57:20.400 --> 57:22.861
When I get excited...

57:22.902 --> 57:26.030
My little China girl...

57:26.072 --> 57:30.910
She says, "Oh, baby,
just you shut your mouth."

57:32.287 --> 57:34.038
Shut your mouth. All right.

57:34.080 --> 57:35.874
We all know the words.

57:35.915 --> 57:38.877
God, I love David Bowie.
He is so sexy.

57:38.918 --> 57:41.379
You think the "time to make
the donuts" guy is sexy.

57:41.421 --> 57:44.007
That guy is funny.

57:44.048 --> 57:46.718
You know who else
I think is sexy?

57:51.181 --> 57:52.724
That's good.
Thank you very much.

57:52.765 --> 57:54.058
I gotta go to the bathroom.

57:54.100 --> 57:58.146
Excuse us, guys.
We'll be right back.

57:59.939 --> 58:01.983
She'll feel better
once she yaks.

58:02.025 --> 58:04.569
I hope so.

58:14.078 --> 58:15.246
So...

58:16.456 --> 58:18.333
Sunday's the big day, huh?

58:18.374 --> 58:19.834
I don't even know
your last name.

58:19.876 --> 58:21.252
It's Gulia.

58:24.214 --> 58:26.633
Julia's last name
is gonna be Gulia.

58:26.633 --> 58:28.718
Julia Gulia. That's funny.

58:28.760 --> 58:30.637
Why is that funny?

58:32.305 --> 58:34.390
I don't know.

58:39.771 --> 58:41.231
Are you excited?

58:43.316 --> 58:45.610
Yeah. She's paid her dues,
been with me four years.

58:45.652 --> 58:47.612
I owe it to her to get married.

58:47.654 --> 58:50.198
You had the Long Island
iced tea.

58:50.240 --> 58:53.827
Plus, you know, you probably...

58:53.868 --> 58:55.161
you want to get married.

58:56.955 --> 58:58.832
I don't want to break up.

58:58.873 --> 59:00.458
Plus, she was with me
before I made my money...

59:00.500 --> 59:01.626
so I know I can trust her.

59:09.551 --> 59:12.303
That is a luscious ass
right there, isn't it?

59:12.345 --> 59:13.763
My God.

59:15.807 --> 59:18.059
That's Grade-A,
top-choice meat.

59:18.101 --> 59:21.146
Like to bite
right through that thing.

59:21.187 --> 59:22.814
Chew on it.

59:22.856 --> 59:24.941
But we can't get chicks
like that anymore.

59:24.983 --> 59:26.234
We're too old.

59:26.276 --> 59:28.111
Speak for yourself.
I'm not too old.

59:28.153 --> 59:29.487
I can still get chicks
like that.

59:29.529 --> 59:31.906
Not that hot, though, right?

59:33.074 --> 59:34.951
I've gotten hotter.

59:34.993 --> 59:36.452
10 years ago.

59:37.787 --> 59:40.290
Try 10 days ago.

59:41.457 --> 59:43.168
Really?

59:43.209 --> 59:44.752
As hot as that?

59:46.254 --> 59:48.798
Hotter and younger.

59:50.133 --> 59:52.343
How do you do it, man?

59:52.385 --> 59:54.304
How do you do it
without getting caught?

59:56.723 --> 59:59.058
Julia is totally preoccupied
with the wedding.

59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.602
She doesn't know
what's going on.

01:00:00.643 --> 01:00:02.979
Oh, man.

01:00:03.021 --> 01:00:05.064
You know what sucks, though?

01:00:05.106 --> 01:00:08.693
Once you get married,
the party's over, right?

01:00:08.735 --> 01:00:10.278
I work in the city, man.

01:00:11.446 --> 01:00:13.198
And I work long hours.

01:00:14.407 --> 01:00:16.409
Yeah, that's something.

01:00:18.536 --> 01:00:21.080
Julia's feeling
a little under the weather.

01:00:21.122 --> 01:00:22.624
Told you she was gonna yak.

01:00:22.665 --> 01:00:25.084
Yeah, you called it.

01:00:25.084 --> 01:00:27.504
Why don't you go get your car
and meet us out front?

01:00:33.551 --> 01:00:35.220
Oh, God. I forgot my purse.

01:00:35.261 --> 01:00:38.014
Do me a favor and put her
in the car with Glenn.

01:00:38.056 --> 01:00:40.016
-No problem.
-It's OK.

01:00:44.103 --> 01:00:45.605
I puked.

01:00:45.647 --> 01:00:48.274
OK. Don't worry.

01:00:48.316 --> 01:00:50.068
I vomited in my hair.

01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:51.236
All right.

01:00:51.277 --> 01:00:53.947
Does my hair smell bad?

01:00:58.493 --> 01:01:00.411
No, it smells good, actually.

01:01:02.372 --> 01:01:04.165
Just feel better, all right?

01:01:10.797 --> 01:01:12.674
Hi, Glenn.

01:01:17.136 --> 01:01:18.888
Don't puke in the car,
all right?

01:01:20.515 --> 01:01:21.808
It'll stink for a week.

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:51.087
What do you think of Glenn?
Do you think he's trustworthy?

01:01:51.171 --> 01:01:53.047
Yeah, he better be.

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.508
Who cares about Glenn?

01:01:57.385 --> 01:01:58.845
You know what
I keep thinking about?

01:01:58.845 --> 01:02:00.263
What?

01:02:00.305 --> 01:02:03.475
That soft kiss
from the other day.

01:02:04.684 --> 01:02:06.644
It looked really nice.

01:02:09.272 --> 01:02:10.815
Did it feel good?

01:02:13.359 --> 01:02:15.653
I don't know.

01:02:15.695 --> 01:02:16.946
I don't remember.

01:02:16.988 --> 01:02:19.741
Could I refresh your memory?

01:02:32.003 --> 01:02:33.171
Yummy.

01:02:36.674 --> 01:02:39.761
So you know Julia's
staying at Glenn's tonight.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.351
Look, Robbie,
I know that you're shy...

01:02:46.392 --> 01:02:48.686
and I know
that you've been hurt...

01:02:48.728 --> 01:02:53.525
so I'm gonna make this
really easy on you.

01:02:54.734 --> 01:02:58.363
If you come upstairs,
you're gonna get laid.

01:02:58.404 --> 01:03:00.281
Wow.

01:03:01.449 --> 01:03:04.035
Nobody's ever said that
to me before.

01:03:06.162 --> 01:03:08.039
I just--I'm telling you...

01:03:08.081 --> 01:03:09.958
my head's kind of a mess
right now.

01:03:11.918 --> 01:03:14.337
Julia's staying
at Glenn's tonight, huh?

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.090
Does she stay over there a lot?

01:03:19.759 --> 01:03:21.010
Really?

01:03:24.597 --> 01:03:26.808
Oh, my God.

01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:27.851
What?

01:03:27.892 --> 01:03:31.062
I can't believe
I never noticed it before.

01:03:34.983 --> 01:03:36.943
You've got a thing for Julia.

01:03:36.943 --> 01:03:39.571
Oh, no, I don't.

01:03:39.612 --> 01:03:40.947
I think she's
a very nice girl...

01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:43.241
but she's marrying
that jerk-off.

01:03:43.283 --> 01:03:46.578
You know why
she's marrying him, don't you?

01:03:49.873 --> 01:03:52.125
The money thing?

01:03:52.167 --> 01:03:54.669
Security? A nice house?

01:03:54.711 --> 01:03:56.921
I guess that's important
to some people.

01:03:56.963 --> 01:03:59.174
No, it's...

01:03:59.215 --> 01:04:02.927
It's not important
to some people, Robbie.

01:04:02.969 --> 01:04:04.596
It's important to all people.

01:04:04.637 --> 01:04:08.516
Really? Then I guess
I'm in big trouble.

01:04:08.558 --> 01:04:10.768
Morning, sunshine.

01:04:13.688 --> 01:04:15.815
I have a bad headache.

01:04:15.857 --> 01:04:17.484
A really bad headache.

01:04:17.525 --> 01:04:19.652
Can I cook you
some breakfast?

01:04:22.697 --> 01:04:25.617
How was your bottle of rum
last night?

01:04:27.994 --> 01:04:30.205
I didn't vomit on you, did l?

01:04:31.915 --> 01:04:36.336
A little on my shoe,
but I was wearing your shoes.

01:04:36.377 --> 01:04:37.670
Good.

01:04:40.131 --> 01:04:43.218
So, did anything happen
with Robbie last night?

01:04:46.471 --> 01:04:49.516
A kiss.

01:04:49.557 --> 01:04:51.559
Did you kiss him,
or did he kiss you?

01:04:51.601 --> 01:04:53.895
I kissed him.

01:04:53.937 --> 01:04:54.979
And then what?

01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:56.481
Nothing.

01:04:59.150 --> 01:05:03.238
He sure doesn't
think much of Glenn, though.

01:05:03.279 --> 01:05:05.490
Really? What did he say?

01:05:05.532 --> 01:05:07.784
That Glenn's a jerk-off.

01:05:11.538 --> 01:05:13.540
Why would he say that?

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:16.251
Who knows?
Maybe he was jealous.

01:05:16.292 --> 01:05:20.505
Don't worry. I told him
why you were marrying him.

01:05:20.547 --> 01:05:23.091
Why did you tell him
I was marrying him?

01:05:23.132 --> 01:05:25.301
Because you love him...

01:05:25.343 --> 01:05:30.014
and because...

01:05:30.056 --> 01:05:32.225
because with Glenn,
you'll have security.

01:05:33.393 --> 01:05:35.353
But that's not
why I'm marrying him.

01:05:37.605 --> 01:05:39.315
Then why are you?

01:05:55.415 --> 01:05:57.750
Hi, Rosie. How are you?

01:05:57.792 --> 01:05:59.002
Fine, dear.

01:05:59.043 --> 01:06:01.504
Is Robbie here?
I came by to give him something.

01:06:01.546 --> 01:06:04.674
No, Julia.
I'm afraid he's not.

01:06:04.716 --> 01:06:07.719
But it's Thursday.
You have singing lessons today.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.429
Not anymore.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:11.723
Now that he's gone to the city
to get a real job...

01:06:11.764 --> 01:06:14.350
he doesn't have time
to give me lessons.

01:06:14.392 --> 01:06:16.728
Why do you think you'd be
a good hire for this bank?

01:06:16.769 --> 01:06:18.521
I'm ready to work hard...

01:06:18.563 --> 01:06:21.357
and when I put my mind
to something, I go all the way.

01:06:21.399 --> 01:06:22.775
I'll go all the way
for you, sir.

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:25.403
Do you have any experience?

01:06:25.445 --> 01:06:29.115
I have no experience,
but I'm a big fan of money.

01:06:29.157 --> 01:06:32.410
I like it. I use it.
I have a little.

01:06:32.452 --> 01:06:34.787
I keep it in a jar
on top of my refrigerator.

01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:37.248
I'd like to put more in it.
That's where you come in.

01:06:39.751 --> 01:06:41.586
He wants to make money.

01:06:41.628 --> 01:06:48.051
Live in a nice house
with wide windows and lamps.

01:06:48.134 --> 01:06:51.471
You can't expect him to live
forever with his sister...

01:06:51.513 --> 01:06:54.682
and the nipple-twisting
that goes on there.

01:06:54.724 --> 01:06:56.267
I thank you for your time.

01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:59.229
Actually, sir, I need this job
to impress a girl.

01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:00.939
Will you leave now, please?

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.774
You don't even have
to give me the job.

01:07:02.816 --> 01:07:04.943
If you could give me some cards
with my name on it...

01:07:04.984 --> 01:07:06.069
I think that might help.

01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:08.696
I'm gonna try
and go look for him, OK?

01:07:08.738 --> 01:07:10.782
Tell him I'll give him a raise.

01:07:10.824 --> 01:07:13.368
Three meatballs a lesson.

01:07:13.409 --> 01:07:14.869
How about this?

01:07:14.911 --> 01:07:17.455
10 singing lessons
for one business card.

01:07:17.497 --> 01:07:19.499
Thank you very much.

01:07:43.189 --> 01:07:45.483
Hey, Julia.
What are you doing here?

01:07:45.525 --> 01:07:48.486
I went by Rosie's to find you.

01:07:48.528 --> 01:07:51.781
I'm not doing that anymore.

01:07:51.823 --> 01:07:56.077
I thought that teaching
was a big part of your life.

01:07:56.119 --> 01:07:58.705
It was, but now I'm doing
some stuff...

01:07:58.746 --> 01:08:01.332
to better my situation.

01:08:01.374 --> 01:08:02.876
Sounds kind of selfish.

01:08:04.294 --> 01:08:06.796
It's not selfish. There's
a lot of money out there.

01:08:06.838 --> 01:08:08.089
I'm trying to get
my hands on some.

01:08:08.131 --> 01:08:10.842
But you don't want to be
just another yuppie idiot.

01:08:10.884 --> 01:08:12.177
What's wrong with that?

01:08:12.218 --> 01:08:14.929
Don't want to live in
my sister's basement anymore.

01:08:14.971 --> 01:08:17.599
I want to get a big house,
have some security.

01:08:18.892 --> 01:08:21.352
Can't do that doing favors
for people all the time...

01:08:21.394 --> 01:08:22.687
getting paid in meatballs.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:24.856
But you're above
all that material bullshit.

01:08:24.898 --> 01:08:27.859
I don't know. We're living
in a material world...

01:08:27.901 --> 01:08:30.737
and I am a material girl.
Or boy.

01:08:30.778 --> 01:08:32.947
No, you're not.

01:08:32.988 --> 01:08:35.158
What about you?
You're into material shit.

01:08:36.743 --> 01:08:37.868
What do you mean?

01:08:37.911 --> 01:08:40.330
You're marrying Glenn
'cause he's got money.

01:08:48.962 --> 01:08:50.715
You asshole.

01:09:02.727 --> 01:09:06.189
Oh, my gosh.
She made me a present.

01:09:06.272 --> 01:09:08.274
I am an asshole!

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:13.154
You're going
to the mental institution.

01:09:13.196 --> 01:09:14.197
Beat it!

01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:40.305
-Rudy.
-Same?

01:09:40.348 --> 01:09:42.433
Give me the same, please.

01:09:45.687 --> 01:09:46.813
What's up?

01:09:46.854 --> 01:09:48.814
-There he is.
-You all right?

01:09:48.857 --> 01:09:51.401
You know something?

01:09:51.442 --> 01:09:53.111
You were right.
You've always been right.

01:09:53.153 --> 01:09:55.530
What have I been so right about?

01:09:55.572 --> 01:09:59.409
Women.
You just have fun with them.

01:09:59.450 --> 01:10:01.786
You get emotionally involved,
and they end up...

01:10:01.828 --> 01:10:03.079
What do they do to you?

01:10:04.956 --> 01:10:08.126
They rip your heart
out of your ass.

01:10:08.168 --> 01:10:09.794
That's right.

01:10:09.836 --> 01:10:12.463
Did something happen with Julia?

01:10:12.505 --> 01:10:15.633
I went on
that double date, right?

01:10:15.675 --> 01:10:17.969
And the moron
she's gonna marry...

01:10:18.011 --> 01:10:20.847
actually tells me
he cheats on her.

01:10:20.889 --> 01:10:22.891
But can I tell her?

01:10:22.932 --> 01:10:25.477
No. Who am l
to break up a marriage?

01:10:25.518 --> 01:10:28.313
You need a prostitute.

01:10:33.276 --> 01:10:36.863
Anyways...I'm confused.

01:10:36.905 --> 01:10:39.032
Because you like her.

01:10:41.451 --> 01:10:44.287
I think I'm in love with her.

01:10:46.289 --> 01:10:49.000
But I gotta get that
out of my head, you know?

01:10:52.253 --> 01:10:54.881
From now on,
I'm gonna be like you.

01:10:54.923 --> 01:10:57.175
I'm gonna be with
a different chick every night...

01:10:57.217 --> 01:10:58.718
and then I'll send them packin'.

01:10:58.718 --> 01:11:01.346
Sounds like you got it
all figured out.

01:11:01.387 --> 01:11:05.183
I'm gonna have to give them
cab money to go home...

01:11:05.225 --> 01:11:06.392
because I'll feel bad
if I don't...

01:11:06.434 --> 01:11:08.228
but after that,
it's Bye-Bye, Birdie.

01:11:10.063 --> 01:11:12.565
That's it, man,
starting right now.

01:11:12.565 --> 01:11:16.027
We are gonna be free and happy
the rest of our lives.

01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:24.160
I'm not happy.
I'm miserable.

01:11:24.244 --> 01:11:26.037
What?

01:11:26.079 --> 01:11:29.374
I grew up idolizing guys...

01:11:29.415 --> 01:11:31.709
like Fonzie
and Vinnie Barbarino...

01:11:31.751 --> 01:11:33.253
'cause they got
a lot of chicks.

01:11:33.253 --> 01:11:36.256
You know what happened to Fonzie
and Vinnie Barbarino?

01:11:36.256 --> 01:11:39.801
I read that Fonzie
wants to be a director...

01:11:39.843 --> 01:11:43.471
and Barbarino, I think,
the mechanical bull movie.

01:11:43.513 --> 01:11:44.639
I didn't see it yet.

01:11:44.681 --> 01:11:49.561
Their shows got canceled
'cause no one wants to see

01:11:49.602 --> 01:11:52.147
a 50-year-old guy
hitting on chicks.

01:11:53.648 --> 01:11:54.983
What are you saying?

01:11:55.024 --> 01:11:57.777
What I'm saying is,
all I really want...

01:11:57.819 --> 01:12:00.280
is someone to hold me...

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.909
and tell me that everything
is gonna be all right.

01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:09.247
Everything is
gonna be all right.

01:12:13.293 --> 01:12:15.003
If you found someone
you can love...

01:12:15.044 --> 01:12:17.255
you can't let her get away.

01:12:19.048 --> 01:12:22.343
You're right, man.
Thank you, Sammy.

01:12:22.385 --> 01:12:24.179
Don't tell anyone what I said.

01:12:27.932 --> 01:12:29.893
Mom.

01:12:31.102 --> 01:12:33.188
Do you really like Glenn?

01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:36.107
Oh, sure, honey.
What's not to like?

01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:38.109
He's rich, he's charming,
he's handsome...

01:12:38.151 --> 01:12:41.488
and now he's really got it all
'cause he's got you.

01:12:44.949 --> 01:12:47.035
Honey, what's the matter?

01:12:48.995 --> 01:12:52.123
I don't know if
I'm in love with him anymore.

01:12:52.165 --> 01:12:55.418
Why? What happened?

01:12:59.088 --> 01:13:02.467
I just don't know
if he's the right guy for me.

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.471
And I've been spending
a lot of time...

01:13:06.513 --> 01:13:09.641
with this other man,
Robbie Hart.

01:13:09.682 --> 01:13:12.977
The wedding singer?

01:13:13.019 --> 01:13:15.939
You're thinking of leaving
Glenn for the wedding singer?

01:13:17.357 --> 01:13:19.484
I don't know
what I'm thinking.

01:13:19.526 --> 01:13:20.819
I'm confused.

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:23.196
I know, sweetie.

01:13:23.238 --> 01:13:26.491
You've got what is known
as the jitters, cold feet.

01:13:26.533 --> 01:13:29.911
Everybody has 'em. I had 'em.

01:13:29.953 --> 01:13:31.746
Course, I should have run
screaming down the street...

01:13:31.788 --> 01:13:34.833
instead of marrying your father,
but Glenn is different.

01:13:34.874 --> 01:13:36.000
He's a keeper.

01:13:38.169 --> 01:13:40.880
You're gonna marry Glenn
on Sunday.

01:13:40.922 --> 01:13:42.799
You're gonna love him...

01:13:42.841 --> 01:13:44.801
and everything's
gonna be wonderful.

01:13:48.513 --> 01:13:50.890
Where's your veil?
It's downstairs.

01:13:50.932 --> 01:13:52.225
I'll go get it.

01:14:19.002 --> 01:14:21.379
Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:14:21.421 --> 01:14:23.173
I'm Mrs. Glenn Gulia.

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:30.263
Hello. It's nice to meet you.
I'm Julia Gulia.

01:14:34.476 --> 01:14:36.478
Right when I wake up
in the morning...

01:14:36.519 --> 01:14:38.730
you're the first person
that pops in my head.

01:14:38.771 --> 01:14:41.566
I keep thinking
about you over and over.

01:14:41.608 --> 01:14:45.778
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Mrs. Julia Gulia.

01:14:56.039 --> 01:14:58.541
I'm pleased to meet you.

01:14:58.625 --> 01:15:00.335
I'm Mrs. Robbie Hart.

01:15:01.794 --> 01:15:04.589
Robbie and I are so pleased
you could come to our wedding.

01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:43.461
Pretty good?

01:15:45.505 --> 01:15:46.673
What happened?

01:15:46.714 --> 01:15:50.468
She just looked way too happy.
I couldn't do it.

01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:53.388
I'm sorry, man.

01:15:53.429 --> 01:15:56.141
Hey, Rudy. Get Robbie a double.

01:15:56.182 --> 01:15:58.685
Actually, Rudy,
don't even worry about it.

01:15:58.685 --> 01:15:59.978
I brought my own.

01:16:00.019 --> 01:16:02.147
You can't drink that in here.

01:16:02.188 --> 01:16:04.315
All right.

01:16:04.357 --> 01:16:07.443
I'll finish up in the alley.
Are you guys coming?

01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:19.873
It's the wedding singer.

01:16:19.914 --> 01:16:21.875
Hey, Glenn. What's up?

01:16:21.916 --> 01:16:24.919
I heard you couldn't
close the deal with Holly.

01:16:24.961 --> 01:16:26.880
What's the matter with that?
You're not...

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.882
You like women, right?

01:16:28.882 --> 01:16:30.717
Not as much as you do, I guess.

01:16:30.758 --> 01:16:33.553
We're gonna have a little
pre-bachelor party.

01:16:33.595 --> 01:16:35.805
You want to come
and have a beer?

01:16:35.847 --> 01:16:37.015
You're ridiculous, man.

01:16:38.516 --> 01:16:41.352
Stop all this
cheating shit, moron.

01:16:41.394 --> 01:16:42.520
She's a good girl.

01:16:42.562 --> 01:16:44.105
Hey, asswipe...

01:16:45.857 --> 01:16:47.525
don't go snitchin'
to Julia about this.

01:16:47.567 --> 01:16:50.028
I know you got
some little crush on her...

01:16:50.069 --> 01:16:52.280
but you gotta face the facts.

01:16:52.322 --> 01:16:54.574
She'd rather go to bed
with a real man...

01:16:54.616 --> 01:16:55.950
not some poor singing orphan.

01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:01.456
All right, shithead.
I haven't been in a fight...

01:17:01.498 --> 01:17:03.124
since I was
in the fifth grade...

01:17:03.166 --> 01:17:05.460
but I beat the shit
out of that kid...

01:17:05.502 --> 01:17:07.212
so now I'm gonna beat
the shit out of you.

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.924
What are you doing?

01:17:10.965 --> 01:17:12.967
I'm sorry.

01:17:13.009 --> 01:17:15.178
I used to be much stronger.

01:17:23.102 --> 01:17:24.729
Why don't you write
a song about this?

01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:26.189
You can call it...

01:17:26.231 --> 01:17:28.900
"l got punched in the nose...

01:17:28.942 --> 01:17:31.444
"for stickin' my face
in other people's business."

01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:37.826
Way to go.

01:17:37.867 --> 01:17:40.370
Sounds like a country song.

01:17:55.593 --> 01:17:58.388
Kiss my grits.

01:18:04.561 --> 01:18:09.274
I can see that you're drunk,
and that's OK.

01:18:09.315 --> 01:18:11.484
I'm still gonna tell you this.

01:18:11.526 --> 01:18:14.028
I really miss you,
and I want to come back.

01:18:15.697 --> 01:18:17.824
I don't want
to be alone anymore.

01:18:19.826 --> 01:18:22.078
You're not alone anymore.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.913
Linda's back.

01:19:07.874 --> 01:19:10.084
Can I help you?

01:19:13.505 --> 01:19:14.797
Is Robbie here?

01:19:16.633 --> 01:19:18.635
I'm afraid he's indisposed.

01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:23.598
Shower.

01:19:28.102 --> 01:19:29.646
You must be Linda.

01:19:29.687 --> 01:19:33.149
Yeah, that's me...
Robbie's fiancee.

01:19:33.191 --> 01:19:35.151
Who are you?

01:19:35.193 --> 01:19:36.444
I'm Julia Sullivan.

01:19:38.488 --> 01:19:40.824
Would you tell him
that I came by to see him?

01:19:40.865 --> 01:19:43.201
Oh, yeah,
surely will, Jennifer.

01:19:43.243 --> 01:19:44.619
It's Julia.

01:20:02.137 --> 01:20:04.806
Wake up, sleepyhead.

01:20:04.848 --> 01:20:07.725
This is the first day
of our new life together.

01:20:10.145 --> 01:20:11.271
Wake me up...

01:20:11.312 --> 01:20:13.273
Before you go-go.

01:20:13.314 --> 01:20:17.277
Don't leave me hanging on
like a solo.

01:20:28.621 --> 01:20:29.873
What are you doing here?

01:20:31.624 --> 01:20:35.420
Well, you passed out,
so I took care of you.

01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:37.922
What?
Why'd you take care of me?

01:20:39.632 --> 01:20:42.760
I told you last night.
I realized I was wrong...

01:20:42.802 --> 01:20:44.929
and I want to take
care of you for good.

01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:46.097
I can learn
to deal with the fact...

01:20:46.139 --> 01:20:49.434
that you're a wedding singer
and not a rock star.

01:20:49.476 --> 01:20:51.269
You can learn to deal with that?

01:20:51.311 --> 01:20:54.314
I don't want you to learn
to deal with that.

01:20:54.314 --> 01:20:57.484
That's not how it works. Jeez!

01:21:00.487 --> 01:21:03.072
Maybe we should talk about this
when you're feeling better.

01:21:03.114 --> 01:21:05.450
Hey, psycho...

01:21:05.492 --> 01:21:07.285
I'm not gonna feel
better about this.

01:21:07.327 --> 01:21:09.078
It's over.

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.456
Now please get out
of my Van Halen t-shirt...

01:21:11.498 --> 01:21:13.791
before you jinx the band
and they break up.

01:21:18.505 --> 01:21:20.757
So you're still pissed
about that wedding thing.

01:21:33.978 --> 01:21:35.021
Glenn, good morning.

01:21:39.984 --> 01:21:42.111
Hey, baby.

01:21:42.153 --> 01:21:44.197
You gonna make breakfast in bed?

01:21:45.907 --> 01:21:48.701
Actually, I've been doing
some thinking, and...

01:21:50.203 --> 01:21:52.330
I don't need a big wedding...

01:21:52.372 --> 01:21:54.582
and I think
that I've been really selfish...

01:21:54.624 --> 01:21:58.086
making you do something
you don't even want to do.

01:22:00.547 --> 01:22:02.048
You wanna go to Vegas?

01:22:05.343 --> 01:22:07.971
All right. Let's go.

01:22:10.557 --> 01:22:13.852
There were bells...

01:22:13.893 --> 01:22:16.896
On a hill...

01:22:16.938 --> 01:22:22.652
But I never heard them ringing.

01:22:22.694 --> 01:22:27.157
No, I never heard
them at all...

01:22:27.198 --> 01:22:32.704
'Til there was you.

01:22:34.205 --> 01:22:38.960
And there was music...

01:22:39.002 --> 01:22:44.132
And there were wonderful roses.

01:22:44.174 --> 01:22:47.051
They tell me...

01:22:47.093 --> 01:22:49.053
In sweet...

01:22:49.095 --> 01:22:52.724
Fragrant meadows...

01:22:52.765 --> 01:22:59.772
Of dawn and dew.

01:22:59.814 --> 01:23:02.358
There was love...

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.401
All around...

01:23:03.443 --> 01:23:07.280
Flight number 1156
is now ready for boarding.

01:23:07.322 --> 01:23:11.826
We'd like to ask passengers
traveling with small children...

01:23:11.868 --> 01:23:16.915
I never heard it at all...

01:23:16.956 --> 01:23:23.796
'Til there was you.

01:23:23.838 --> 01:23:25.715
I just always
envisioned the right one...

01:23:25.757 --> 01:23:27.967
being someone
I could grow old with.

01:23:34.766 --> 01:23:37.185
I know. I'll go get the car.

01:23:38.645 --> 01:23:41.189
Rosie, congratulations.

01:23:41.231 --> 01:23:42.565
I gotta go take care
of something, OK?

01:23:42.607 --> 01:23:45.276
I know you do. Go get her.

01:23:45.318 --> 01:23:47.278
All right.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.863
-l need to talk to you.
-l can't talk right now.

01:23:48.905 --> 01:23:52.116
-Are you back with Linda?
-No. Who said that?

01:23:52.158 --> 01:23:54.744
Julia.
She went to your house...

01:23:54.786 --> 01:23:56.621
to tell you she was
falling for you...

01:23:56.663 --> 01:23:58.665
and Linda answered the door
in her underwear.

01:23:58.665 --> 01:24:00.041
She was so upset...

01:24:00.083 --> 01:24:01.918
she and Glenn
jumped a plane to Vegas.

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.087
What do you mean? They're
getting married tomorrow.

01:24:04.128 --> 01:24:06.422
Apparently,
that wasn't soon enough.

01:24:08.591 --> 01:24:09.592
I said, hip, hop...

01:24:09.676 --> 01:24:11.761
A-hippie to the hippie
to the hip, hip, hop.

01:24:11.803 --> 01:24:13.972
You don't stop rockin'
to the bang, bang boogie...

01:24:14.013 --> 01:24:15.265
Say, up comes the boogie...

01:24:15.306 --> 01:24:16.724
To the rhythm
of the boogie that beats.

01:24:16.766 --> 01:24:18.768
We're now ready
for our general boarding.

01:24:18.852 --> 01:24:20.687
That's it, sweetie.
Ready to go?

01:24:22.647 --> 01:24:25.733
This is a great idea.
I'm glad you came around.

01:24:25.775 --> 01:24:27.777
You want to do some
gambling and fun right away...

01:24:27.819 --> 01:24:28.987
or just get married?

01:24:29.028 --> 01:24:30.905
I just want to get married.

01:24:30.947 --> 01:24:32.824
You're never going to find her.

01:24:32.866 --> 01:24:35.034
There's got to be a million
wedding chapels in Vegas.

01:24:35.076 --> 01:24:37.245
-Does anybody have a pen?
-What for?

01:24:37.287 --> 01:24:38.788
I got a good idea for a song.

01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:41.291
-Here.
-Thank you.

01:24:46.337 --> 01:24:47.547
Thank you.

01:24:47.589 --> 01:24:48.631
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:24:48.673 --> 01:24:50.341
Can I help you?

01:24:50.383 --> 01:24:52.343
I need a ticket
for Las Vegas, please.

01:24:54.262 --> 01:24:57.348
We only have one seat left
in our first-class section.

01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:58.850
The next flight
leaves in the morning.

01:25:00.226 --> 01:25:02.479
Can I borrow
your credit card?

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:04.355
You're going
to pay me back, right?

01:25:04.397 --> 01:25:06.399
No, but if you don't
give it to me...

01:25:06.441 --> 01:25:10.111
I'm going to tell everybody
what you said at the bar.

01:25:10.153 --> 01:25:11.321
Thanks.

01:25:11.362 --> 01:25:13.531
That was really nice of you.

01:25:13.573 --> 01:25:14.741
Thanks.

01:25:14.782 --> 01:25:16.743
Do you like
Flock of Seagulls?

01:25:16.784 --> 01:25:19.037
I can see you do.

01:25:19.078 --> 01:25:20.538
-Wish me luck.
-Go get her!

01:25:32.217 --> 01:25:33.551
Do you mind
if we switched seats...

01:25:33.593 --> 01:25:35.011
and I sat in the window seat?

01:25:36.971 --> 01:25:38.556
I hate the aisle seat.

01:25:38.598 --> 01:25:41.351
Every time that cart comes by,
it bangs me in the elbows.

01:25:41.392 --> 01:25:45.355
Your arms are smaller
than mine, Jules.

01:25:45.396 --> 01:25:49.567
I know. I just never saw
the lights of Vegas before.

01:25:51.361 --> 01:25:52.862
Tell you what.

01:25:52.904 --> 01:25:55.532
How about I let you lean over me
when we fly over the strip?

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.542
Thank you.

01:26:06.793 --> 01:26:07.961
Hot towel?

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:12.257
Thanks.

01:26:21.891 --> 01:26:24.644
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

01:26:25.812 --> 01:26:27.939
I've never been
on first class before.

01:26:27.981 --> 01:26:30.358
My name is Joyce.
Just buzz if you need anything.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.610
Thank you. Here.

01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:39.284
Sir?

01:26:39.325 --> 01:26:40.785
Is that Billy Idol?

01:26:42.537 --> 01:26:44.789
-I believe it is.
-Oh, my God.

01:26:44.831 --> 01:26:47.500
Would you like some champagne
or some orange juice?

01:26:47.542 --> 01:26:49.169
How much is it?

01:26:49.210 --> 01:26:52.297
-It's free.
-It's what?

01:26:52.338 --> 01:26:54.549
Holy shit, this is incredible.

01:26:54.591 --> 01:26:55.842
Actually, I shouldn't drink.

01:26:55.884 --> 01:26:59.053
I fell in love with this girl
who's going to marry an idiot...

01:26:59.095 --> 01:27:01.097
so I'm on my way to Vegas
to stop them.

01:27:01.181 --> 01:27:04.601
That's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

01:27:04.642 --> 01:27:06.019
Where are they getting married?

01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.061
I don't know where...

01:27:07.103 --> 01:27:08.855
but I'm going to run around
and find them.

01:27:08.897 --> 01:27:10.356
I got to do what I got to do.

01:27:21.034 --> 01:27:22.660
Next time they come by,
grab me a Heineken.

01:27:30.877 --> 01:27:32.670
She comes over to tell me
how she feels...

01:27:32.712 --> 01:27:34.714
and Linda answers the door...

01:27:34.714 --> 01:27:37.217
wearing nothing
but my Van Halen t-shirt.

01:27:37.258 --> 01:27:38.843
No way.

01:27:38.885 --> 01:27:40.094
I don't know what to do.

01:27:40.136 --> 01:27:42.639
She's getting married,
and he's going to ruin her life.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:44.933
Glenn doesn't deserve her.

01:27:44.974 --> 01:27:47.060
All he cares about
are possessions...

01:27:47.101 --> 01:27:51.064
fancy cars, CD players.

01:27:51.105 --> 01:27:53.566
Even women
are possessions to him.

01:27:53.608 --> 01:27:54.734
Billy idol gets it.

01:27:54.776 --> 01:27:56.653
I don't know why
she doesn't get it.

01:27:56.694 --> 01:27:57.946
I hope you find her.

01:27:57.987 --> 01:27:59.656
You guys
will not believe this.

01:27:59.697 --> 01:28:01.741
Some creep in coach
who thinks he's Don Johnson...

01:28:01.783 --> 01:28:04.536
just asked me to be part
of the mile-high club.

01:28:04.577 --> 01:28:08.206
He said I was
Grade-A, top-choice meat.

01:28:14.254 --> 01:28:15.880
Is he right in here?

01:28:17.924 --> 01:28:19.384
What's the mile-high club?

01:28:29.602 --> 01:28:31.479
Oh, my God.
The mile-high guy is Glenn.

01:28:31.521 --> 01:28:32.981
They're on this plane.

01:28:33.022 --> 01:28:34.691
No way!

01:28:34.732 --> 01:28:35.859
You guys got to help me.

01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:37.569
Right!

01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:42.866
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:28:42.907 --> 01:28:46.661
We're flying at 26,000 feet,
moving up to 30,000 feet...

01:28:46.703 --> 01:28:50.039
and we got clear skies
all the way to Las Vegas.

01:28:50.081 --> 01:28:53.251
And now, we're bringing you
some in-flight entertainment.

01:28:53.293 --> 01:28:55.253
One of our first-class
passengers...

01:28:55.295 --> 01:28:56.713
would like
to sing you a song...

01:28:56.754 --> 01:28:58.715
inspired by one
of our coach passengers.

01:28:58.756 --> 01:29:01.718
And since we let
our first-class passengers...

01:29:01.801 --> 01:29:05.430
do pretty much whatever
they want, here he is.

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.019
I wanna make you smile...

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.438
Whenever you're sad...

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.731
Carry you around...

01:29:14.772 --> 01:29:17.317
When your arthritis is bad.

01:29:17.358 --> 01:29:20.069
Oh, all I wanna do...

01:29:20.111 --> 01:29:22.780
Is grow old with you.

01:29:25.783 --> 01:29:27.869
I'll get you medicine...

01:29:27.911 --> 01:29:31.456
When your tummy aches...

01:29:31.498 --> 01:29:33.082
Build you a fire...

01:29:33.124 --> 01:29:35.126
If the furnace breaks.

01:29:35.168 --> 01:29:38.797
Oh, it could be so nice...

01:29:38.838 --> 01:29:41.466
Growin' old with you.

01:29:44.469 --> 01:29:46.554
I'll miss you...

01:29:46.596 --> 01:29:48.848
Kiss you...

01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:50.558
Give you my coat...

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.102
When you are cold...

01:29:53.186 --> 01:29:55.104
Need you...

01:29:55.146 --> 01:29:57.440
Feed you...

01:29:57.482 --> 01:29:59.108
Even let you hold...

01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:01.152
The remote control.

01:30:05.031 --> 01:30:07.033
What the hell's
that fruit doing here?

01:30:12.121 --> 01:30:13.915
Get out of the way!

01:30:13.957 --> 01:30:15.792
Excuse me, sir.
I have to serve the beverages.

01:30:23.216 --> 01:30:25.885
How you doing, sir?
Chicken or fish?

01:30:25.927 --> 01:30:27.387
Get out of my way,
or you're going to get hurt.

01:30:28.596 --> 01:30:31.099
Don't you talk
to Billy Idol that way.

01:30:35.228 --> 01:30:37.188
So let me clear the dishes...

01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:40.275
In our kitchen sink...

01:30:40.316 --> 01:30:41.442
Put you to bed...

01:30:41.484 --> 01:30:43.695
When you've had
too much to drink.

01:30:46.114 --> 01:30:48.658
I could be the man...

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:52.871
Who grows old with you.

01:30:52.912 --> 01:30:55.415
I wanna grow old...

01:30:55.456 --> 01:30:57.750
With you.

01:31:06.634 --> 01:31:09.262
That was the most
beautiful song.

01:31:09.304 --> 01:31:11.014
I got a confession to make.

01:31:11.055 --> 01:31:13.850
That song was about you.

01:31:13.892 --> 01:31:15.351
Good.

01:31:15.393 --> 01:31:17.687
I'm in love with you.

01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:21.941
I am so in love with you.

01:31:23.985 --> 01:31:25.695
That wasn't a bad song.

01:31:25.737 --> 01:31:28.198
I'm going to tell those
record company guys about you.

01:31:28.239 --> 01:31:30.492
You mind if I give her
a kiss first?

01:31:30.533 --> 01:31:32.577
Do what you got to do.

01:31:52.555 --> 01:31:55.266
I know this...

01:31:55.308 --> 01:31:57.101
Much is...

01:31:57.143 --> 01:31:58.436
True.

01:32:02.190 --> 01:32:04.984
I know this...

01:32:05.026 --> 01:32:06.861
Much is...

01:32:06.903 --> 01:32:08.696
True.

01:32:09.697 --> 01:32:11.533
I know, I know, I know...

01:32:11.574 --> 01:32:14.077
This much is true.

01:32:14.118 --> 01:32:16.371
Oh, yes, I do...

01:32:16.412 --> 01:32:20.542
Robbie and Julia.
