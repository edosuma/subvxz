00:00.080 --> 00:04.080
The men holding Bratton
used this boy as a suicide bomber.

00:04.080 --> 00:08.119
I need you to tell me
everything As'ad said to you.

00:08.119 --> 00:13.280
He said that the man who killed
your friends... was another soldier

00:14.720 --> 00:17.960
Collinson, we need to go back!
Just give the order!

00:17.960 --> 00:19.480
Extraction denied.

00:19.480 --> 00:23.480
Have you come to a decision
about our offer to join Section 20

00:30.760 --> 00:33.840
Our own people have got to realise

00:33.840 --> 00:39.400
that they are not a separate entity
from the rest of the people.

00:39.400 --> 00:43.360
We are a free people,
a free nation.

00:43.360 --> 00:50.760
"Don't you realise that the people
of Zimbabwe are a sovereign people."

00:50.760 --> 00:55.080
"We don't have to intervene."

01:40.320 --> 01:43.040
We don't have to be
like the British.

01:43.040 --> 01:46.040
And who are they after all?

01:46.040 --> 01:49.680
Our invaders and colonisers
of yesterday.

01:49.680 --> 01:52.360
Prepare for exit.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.880
Fuck!

03:35.640 --> 03:37.120
Fuck!

03:56.120 --> 03:58.400
Go on, bastard, do it.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.760
Job done. Mugabe's dead.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.200
How can you be so sure?

04:15.440 --> 04:18.040
"President Mugabe
was uninjured in the attack,

04:18.040 --> 04:21.360
but one of his body doubles
is reported dead."

04:21.360 --> 04:25.600
"A suspected gunman, Felix Masuku,
was immediately arrested

04:25.600 --> 04:28.280
and two of his accomplices
shot dead."

04:28.280 --> 04:31.960
"The Zimbabwean Intelligence Service
claims that they have evidence

04:31.960 --> 04:35.680
the assassination attempt was
planned by the British government

04:35.680 --> 04:37.600
with the help of the..."

04:37.600 --> 04:42.040
This is becoming a serious problem.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.080
Christ! He's a British soldier.
Was.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.600
Felix Masuku's parents were killed
in 1982 by Mugabe's troops

04:48.600 --> 04:50.280
in the Matabeleland massacres.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.640
He fled Zimbabwe
was brought up by an aunt in Peckham.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.440
At 18, he joined the Royal Engineers,

04:55.440 --> 04:57.840
before returning to Zimbabwe
six years ago.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.240
You're concerned this history
adds credence to Mugabe's claim

05:01.240 --> 05:04.400
that Britain
is behind the assassination? In one.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.720
Could you hold, please.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.320
We need you to resolve this problem,
Hugh. Understood.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.480
So you want me
to break him out of prison? Correct.

05:19.480 --> 05:24.200
Masuku's being held in the secure
wing of Chikurubi Prison in Harare

05:24.200 --> 05:26.640
No guns, no noise.

05:26.640 --> 05:30.360
No footprints back here. This
is a fully deniable operation.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.640
Layla will be your contact
on the ground.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.280
She'll be based in South Africa
until required in Harare.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.600
You'll be travelling in
on a business visa.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.520
This is your identity. Your cover
will be as an illicit diamond deale

05:41.520 --> 05:44.880
John Dean?
Any objections?

05:44.880 --> 05:46.960
Couldn't be James?

05:46.960 --> 05:51.120
The operation codename
is Ugly Trade.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.600
Chikurubi was originally built
as a British fortress.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.200
We can provide you
with early blueprints,

05:57.200 --> 05:58.960
schematics, archive photos,

05:58.960 --> 06:01.840
whatever you might need
to plan the escape.

06:01.840 --> 06:06.720
Be under no illusion, this prison
is Mugabe's most secure facility

06:06.720 --> 06:09.640
and Masuku
will be under close watch.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.360
So how long do I have
to spring Masuku?

06:12.360 --> 06:14.680
His trial is set
for eight weeks from now.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.320
Look, if we can't leave footprints,
why send a Brit?

06:17.320 --> 06:20.120
My point entirely.
You have a problem with this?

06:20.120 --> 06:22.600
If we had no hand
in the assassination,

06:22.600 --> 06:24.520
why are we so concerned
about Masuku?

06:24.520 --> 06:26.920
Isn't just another case
of deny, deny?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.560
Mugabe will use this as a show trial

06:28.560 --> 06:31.680
to destroy the credibility of the UK
across the entire continent.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.720
And, believe me, it's fragile.

06:33.720 --> 06:37.120
Right now, Masuku represents
a threat to the realm.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.600
He cannot be allowed to stand trial

06:42.320 --> 06:45.640
There is one other thing, John.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.880
If this goes wrong...

06:48.880 --> 06:51.800
The last bullet's for me.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.640
Well, let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.360
John?

07:05.360 --> 07:09.800
I thought you should know,
As'ad's body hasn't been recovered.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.360
John! John, they're leaving him?!

07:16.480 --> 07:19.000
So, he might still be alive?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.520
Well, it's a big desert.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.480
He didn't... tell you anything?

07:33.600 --> 07:37.840
Such as? Anything that might tell u
where he could have gone?

07:42.960 --> 07:45.160
I don't speak Arabic.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.560
Your passport
in the name of John Dean.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.920
Driving licence and condoms.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.680
Standard issue for Africa.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.520
Serviced any other officers recently

08:07.520 --> 08:10.840
Or was I the one
with particularly low self-esteem?

08:10.840 --> 08:13.120
Well, we all have a job to do.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.480
Some are more arduous than others.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.920
Don't get your cock shot off.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.080
I'm really sorry, love,
I can't come up this weekend.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.480
I don't really care
what your excuse is,

08:28.480 --> 08:32.320
you've never been around and I
shouldn't expect you to be now.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.240
Alex, grow up. The world
does not revolve around you.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.760
Why can't you understand that?
Alex?

08:37.760 --> 08:39.440
John, it's me.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.840
Listen, erm... I'm sorry.
It's just she's 17 now.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.160
She's gotta start understanding
what it is I do.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.000
No, no, it's not that.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Erm,... listen, there's something
I've got to tell you.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.760
Just hang on one second.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.840
Two minutes.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.000
Sorry, love,
what was it you wanted to say?

09:03.000 --> 09:06.040
Nothing.
You sure?

09:06.040 --> 09:08.360
Yep. It can wait.

09:08.360 --> 09:12.640
OK. Well, I'll call you
when I get back. I've gotta go, OK?

09:12.640 --> 09:14.560
OK.
"Bye."

09:18.160 --> 09:20.040
Why didn't you tell him?

09:31.080 --> 09:35.160
Felix Masuku, who is also known
as Raymond Frayn.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.960
Irish passport,
South African passport, US passport.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.560
These are all SAS issue IDs, sir.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.760
It gets better. Not only did Masuku

09:43.760 --> 09:47.480
serve in the Regiment between
January 2001 and March 2004,

09:47.480 --> 09:49.800
but since returning to Zimbabwe,

09:49.800 --> 09:52.680
he's been an intelligence source
for MI6.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.720
And we're claiming Masuku
doesn't work for us?!

09:55.720 --> 10:00.800
This isn't just embarrassing,
this... this really stinks.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.720
And?

10:05.360 --> 10:09.080
You knew this. Didn't you?

10:12.760 --> 10:14.560
Have you told Porter?

10:23.520 --> 10:25.880
Porter knows what he needs to know.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.640
Haven't you got a flight to catch,
lieutenant?

10:43.400 --> 10:46.080
This place is dangerous for you,
my friend.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.680
Make sure you behave here otherwise
you will end up in Chikurubi Prison.

10:49.680 --> 10:53.640
If you end up here,
you can kiss your mother goodbye.

10:53.640 --> 10:56.080
You will never see her again.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.120
Harry Curtis. Welcome to Jo'burg.

12:13.120 --> 12:16.600
I like the open air approach
to the embassy. Very un-British.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.160
It made sense
that we met off site.

12:19.160 --> 12:23.680
Hope you're not too knackered. Most
people are undone by the altitude.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.800
I had nose bleeds for a whole month.

12:25.800 --> 12:31.480
Maybe that just happens to
high flyers, Mr First Secretary.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.480
Hardly.
I got everything you asked for.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.960
All legit South African documents.

12:37.960 --> 12:42.000
In the name of a real life
SONOP Inspector, Lizbet Dreyer.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.920
Their brief is counter narcotics
and smuggling.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.440
May I ask what these are for?

12:50.440 --> 12:53.200
I'm a curious sort, you see.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.160
I hadn't noticed.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.880
Thank you, Mr Curtis.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.840
Right.

13:10.560 --> 13:14.480
Normally people try
and short change me.

13:14.480 --> 13:18.840
In this world,
you don't trust anyone, my friend.

13:22.160 --> 13:27.960
Like you said,... trust no-one.

13:42.280 --> 13:46.600
Hands up.
Easy. Take it easy.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.520
Alright!

13:51.440 --> 13:54.120
Take him away.

14:08.360 --> 14:11.360
Hello? Mr Dean's
been picked up as arranged.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.080
When do you intend to visit?
Tomorrow.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.360
So he's on his own
till you get there.

14:16.360 --> 14:20.520
Will he be comfortable? If he keeps
his head down and avoids trouble.

15:51.840 --> 15:55.680
Here... I'm God.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.200
Why are you here?

16:41.200 --> 16:44.280
I made some bad choices.
Didn't we all?

16:44.280 --> 16:46.040
I'm Anthony Silongo.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.680
No!

17:55.680 --> 17:57.640
Argh!

17:58.360 --> 18:00.160
Go!

18:39.840 --> 18:42.040
Argh!

18:42.040 --> 18:45.720
I've got information. Useful
information. About the assassin.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.640
Lexie.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.760
What information?

18:57.880 --> 19:01.440
I know him. I know who he is.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.040
He'll trust me. I'm British.

19:13.600 --> 19:17.040
My name is Elisabet Dreyer.
Elisabet, Elisabet Dreyer.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.960
You are a despicable man.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.440
You are a despicable man
in an ugly trade.

19:21.440 --> 19:26.440
Ugly. My name is Elisabet Dryer,...
Dreyer.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.640
He doesn't trust you, Mr Dean.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.160
And to be honest, I don't blame him.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.880
You've wasted my time.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.360
Sit.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.160
Please.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.560
Wow, I didn't know they allowed
conjugal visits.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.440
Mr John Dean.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.200
Who wants to know?
The South African Government.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.080
We've been monitoring
your smuggling activities.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.520
We believe it's time
you were brought to account.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.400
It was you who had me arrested?

21:21.400 --> 21:24.720
As I will have you extradited
to South Africa to face charges.

21:24.720 --> 21:28.280
Do you have anything to say?
Yeah, darling, get me an upgrade.

21:28.280 --> 21:32.240
Suite, jacuzzi? OK, Mr Dean,
don't get clever with me.

21:32.240 --> 21:36.880
From where I'm standing, you are
a despicable man in an ugly trade.

21:38.160 --> 21:43.040
Listen, sweetheart,
you don't know what ugly is.

21:45.480 --> 21:48.200
I've seen how ugly it can be in here.

21:50.320 --> 21:53.320
Obviously you've come face to face
with it.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.000
Yeah.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.640
I have.

22:02.520 --> 22:05.400
Are you saying you've received
brutal treatment?

22:05.400 --> 22:10.400
No, love, I'm not. I'm saying
everyone is extremely well treated.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.680
Everyone.

22:27.200 --> 22:30.360
Thank you for your assistance,
Colonel. Pleasure to cooperate.

22:30.360 --> 22:34.120
We would appreciate it if Mr Dean
could be moved to a secure wing.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.480
We consider him
to be a dangerous criminal,

22:37.480 --> 22:40.240
and until we have custody of him,
we need to know he's safe.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.280
Of course. And once again,

22:44.280 --> 22:45.480
a pleasure.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.880
Thank you.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.640
You never touch Masuku.
Understand?

23:12.640 --> 23:13.760
Yes, sir.

23:13.760 --> 23:18.600
And if anyone else asks to speak
to Mr Dean, I want to know about it

23:22.080 --> 23:23.120
Yes?

23:23.120 --> 23:26.000
What news of Porter?
He's met the target face to face.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.440
Says he's unharmed.
Masuku's not been tortured?

23:28.440 --> 23:31.360
No. His words were
"extremely well treated."

23:31.360 --> 23:34.360
Really? That may help explain
something. Why?

23:34.360 --> 23:36.520
We intercepted a communication.

23:36.520 --> 23:40.280
They're moving Masuku to
a remand cell under the courthouse.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.440
When?

23:41.440 --> 23:43.720
Noon, the day after tomorrow.

23:43.720 --> 23:47.040
Shit! Have they brought forward
the trial? By two months,

23:47.040 --> 23:50.960
and if they're not torturing Masuku,
they must have the evidence they need

23:50.960 --> 23:54.960
We have accelerate our plans. Well,
I can't just walk back in there.

23:54.960 --> 23:58.680
Tomorrow then?
Porter has to know, Layla.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.960
You've got 48 hours.

24:13.400 --> 24:17.200
I need a copy of an extradition
document now. Where are you?

24:17.200 --> 24:20.040
You know I can't tell you that,
Mr Curtis.

24:20.040 --> 24:24.480
OK. Er, I'll send you
non-specific documentation.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.920
You fill in the blanks.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.280
Who are you?
Friend.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.040
Your cell?

26:10.560 --> 26:13.800
Don't suppose we're off
to breakfast?

26:25.440 --> 26:26.920
Welcome, Mr Dean.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.840
I'm guessing this isn't
Queensberry Rules?

26:35.840 --> 26:38.480
You guess right.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.280
Vincent!

26:44.520 --> 26:47.480
Vincent! Vincent! Vincent!

26:47.480 --> 26:49.840
Bet on me.
I'll give him the first round,

26:49.840 --> 26:52.320
then you can take all the odds
you can get.

26:52.320 --> 26:55.440
What's in it for you?
Keep him... away from that boy.

26:56.480 --> 26:57.720
OK.

26:57.720 --> 26:59.600
We need a handicap.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.520
Ding-ding!

27:42.000 --> 27:43.800
Whoa!

27:46.560 --> 27:48.800
You're not doing so well, my friend.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.320
Double the odds.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.840
I've got the Englishman!

27:56.280 --> 28:00.000
Vincent! Vincent! Vincent!

28:02.440 --> 28:03.840
Quiet!

28:03.840 --> 28:06.720
Alright, boys.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.120
Ding-ding!

29:16.360 --> 29:18.760
Again? So soon?

29:18.760 --> 29:21.520
Consider me your number one stalker,
Mr Dean.

29:21.520 --> 29:24.000
I have your extradition papers.
Time is short.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
You need to go through everything
thoroughly.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.120
If there is anything you wish to
appeal, you have until tomorrow n

29:32.160 --> 29:34.040
This is all very sudden.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.240
Deadlines are changing constantly.

29:36.240 --> 29:39.400
Everything you need
is in this document.

29:39.400 --> 29:44.680
I should warn you that if I don't
receive your confirmation signature,

29:44.680 --> 29:47.680
you might remain here indefinitely.

29:50.760 --> 29:53.120
Do you understand what I'm saying?

29:55.520 --> 29:57.120
It's possible.

29:57.120 --> 30:02.440
I can give you my confirmation
signature first thing tomorrow.

30:04.080 --> 30:07.680
Thank you, Mr Dean.
That would be a relief.

30:07.680 --> 30:12.640
You'll need to remember
this case number.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.800
It will help drive through
the paperwork.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.480
Colonel, how fortunate.

30:27.480 --> 30:31.560
I have a copy of Mr Dean's
extradition application for you.

30:33.280 --> 30:37.880
How efficient! Usually I'm sent
this by your Department of Justice.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.000
I was able to expedite things.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.040
So I see.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.600
Land...

31:14.440 --> 31:16.040
Rover...

31:16.040 --> 31:17.760
Under...

31:17.760 --> 31:19.320
Angel.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.600
Land Rover Under Angel.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.960
You asked to see me?

31:34.960 --> 31:37.080
Organise another fight.

31:37.080 --> 31:40.360
Set two men against me.
No one will bet against you.

31:40.360 --> 31:42.120
Except you.

31:42.120 --> 31:45.800
I'll take the first fight,
I'll throw the second.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.760
We'll both do well.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.400
When?

31:49.400 --> 31:52.440
Tomorrow morning. Same time,

31:52.440 --> 31:54.520
first light.

32:28.240 --> 32:31.920
Tshuma. 
You have urgent mail from Little Fox.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.680
You're coming with me.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.440
Am I?

33:58.880 --> 34:01.200
Trust me.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.880
Hello.

34:42.199 --> 34:43.400
Keys.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.800
Where the fuck is everyone?
Cock fight.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.000
Let's go.

35:16.200 --> 35:20.000
There's been a breach.
I've been compromised.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.960
Get out. Head for the RV.
What about Porter?

35:22.960 --> 35:27.200
He needs transport. I can still get
there. Look after yourself. Get out.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.400
That's an order!

35:39.440 --> 35:40.600
Let's go.

35:52.240 --> 35:55.960
Isn't this a dead end?
Yup, but this is our way out.

35:55.960 --> 35:57.400
What?

36:20.080 --> 36:21.400
OK, go on.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.320
Stop.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.960
Go back.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.440
Give me a hand.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.960
One, two, three.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.200
OK, go.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.160
Go.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.480
You're in charge.

37:57.520 --> 38:00.880
Where the fuck are we?
Old munition tunnels.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.360
Left or right?

38:10.360 --> 38:12.280
Oh, fuck!

38:23.080 --> 38:24.240
Down.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.920
Where's the fucking Land Rover?

38:52.920 --> 38:54.840
I don't fucking believe it!

39:00.240 --> 39:01.800
Go, go!

39:14.560 --> 39:16.000
Hurry up!

39:18.000 --> 39:19.720
Yes!

39:27.840 --> 39:29.280
Get in!

39:31.720 --> 39:33.280
Go! Go!

39:45.440 --> 39:49.480
Radio traffic confirms there has
been a break-out from Chikurubi.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.920
Local police have been ordered
to set up road blocks.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.440
Oh, size 10. Result!

40:08.240 --> 40:10.200
Shit!

40:17.680 --> 40:19.640
Do you think he saw us?

40:37.880 --> 40:39.680
What are we doing?

40:39.680 --> 40:42.040
Ditching this piece of shit.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.960
Cut some brush,
we need to hide the car.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.920
So you want me
to break him out of prison.

40:59.920 --> 41:02.280
Masuku has to disappear completely.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.680
Understood?

41:08.120 --> 41:09.760
Sir.

41:22.800 --> 41:24.800
Of course.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.760
Drop the knife.

41:36.880 --> 41:38.840
I said drop it.

41:53.440 --> 41:59.600
Before you do this,...
you should know something.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.440
I was set up.

42:02.440 --> 42:05.720
The whole assassination was a trap.
They were waiting for me.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.200
On your knees.

42:07.200 --> 42:11.000
I don't make mistakes, Dean.
I'm ex-Regiment, just like you.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.840
Yeah. I was hired by British
Intelligence to kill Mugabe.

42:16.840 --> 42:18.880
Someone betrayed me.

42:18.880 --> 42:22.120
I said get on your knees!
They betrayed me!

42:22.120 --> 42:24.560
They betrayed you, too!

42:24.560 --> 42:27.720
Where was the Land Rover, Dean?
No, where was it?

42:27.720 --> 42:30.240
Shut up! It was supposed to be
there, wasn't it?

42:31.680 --> 42:33.720
Think, Dean! Think!

42:33.720 --> 42:38.640
Those weren't prison guards outside
the prison, they were Elite Guards.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.440
What, ten seconds after the alarm
went off they were outside?

42:42.440 --> 42:46.320
Tshuma's men, Dean.
The same men who captured me.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.360
Who do you trust?

42:55.440 --> 42:57.760
Who the fuck do you trust?

43:16.640 --> 43:18.720
My name's Porter.
