No!

01:45.272 --> 01:48.472
Help! No! Help!

01:48.576 --> 01:51.076
[groans]

01:53.714 --> 01:55.014
Help!

01:55.116 --> 01:58.076
Help! Help!

01:58.185 --> 01:59.845
- Get off!
- Hey!

02:02.556 --> 02:04.356
Run!

02:22.743 --> 02:25.383
- Here you go, Lily.
- Thank you.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.781
Excuse me.

02:28.883 --> 02:30.823
Is she here?
My daughter Lily.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.178
I got a call saying
that she was here.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.046
Jen! Jennifer!

02:37.758 --> 02:39.988
Thank God!

02:40.094 --> 02:42.394
You have no idea
how worried I've been.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.996
Who did this to you?

02:44.098 --> 02:47.328
I couldn't see his face.
He was wearing a mask.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.644
Is that-- This is your
sweatshirt. Is that blood?

02:49.737 --> 02:51.067
No, no, no.
That's not her blood.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.512
I bit his hand

02:53.607 --> 02:57.077
when he put it
over my mouth.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.738
The main thing is,

02:58.846 --> 03:01.706
outside of a few scrapes,
she wasn't hurt.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.315
Poor baby.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.677
Luckily, there was a bystander
that stepped in

03:05.786 --> 03:07.416
and stopped the attack.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.051
What bystander?

03:09.156 --> 03:10.486
I don't know.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.321
He just pulled the guy
off me

03:12.426 --> 03:14.586
- and started beating him up.
- And then what?

03:14.695 --> 03:19.025
I ran, and when I looked back,
they were both gone.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.873
I have a unit
out at the scene right now.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.738
So far we found your MP3 player
and your headphones,

03:23.837 --> 03:26.937
but what I'm hoping for is
a call from our Good Samaritan.

03:27.041 --> 03:30.281
Maybe he can help us
with the I.D.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.277
We're gonna run that blood
sample through our DNA database

03:33.380 --> 03:35.950
and hopefully get a match
on this punk.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.450
Lily, you remember
anything else,

03:38.552 --> 03:40.292
I want you guys to call me,
okay?

03:40.387 --> 03:42.017
You think you'll
be able to catch him?

03:42.122 --> 03:44.922
Well, I can promise you
that we're gonna do our best.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.185
You sure I can't give you
a ride home?

03:47.294 --> 03:50.104
No, I think we'll be all right.
Thank you.

03:50.197 --> 03:53.467
Okay.
You know where to find me.

04:00.975 --> 04:03.075
He was friendlier than usual.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.410
He's known us a long time.
He's just concerned.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.382
Uh-huh.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.551
You're deflecting,
and it's not gonna work.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.220
How are you feeling?
You want to go to the hospital?

04:12.319 --> 04:14.349
I just want to go home
and get some rest.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.115
Okay.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.589
[screams]

04:53.894 --> 04:55.594
Rise and shine.

04:59.433 --> 05:03.103
So I thought I could
take the day off,

05:03.203 --> 05:06.313
and you and I could go to
the mall and get our nails done.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.037
- How's that sound?
- What about your deadline?

05:09.143 --> 05:11.683
I'm only a couple of chapters
away from finishing.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.509
Come on. It'll be fun.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.724
It's okay. Kelly said
she wants to meet for lunch.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.817
You sure?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.289
I'll be fine.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.617
[doorbell rings]

05:22.723 --> 05:24.393
I'll get it.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.209
Scott.

05:44.311 --> 05:45.641
Hi, Mrs. Becker.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.376
I heard about what happened.
Is she here?

05:47.481 --> 05:49.681
She's resting at the moment.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.083
Well, I just brought her these.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.046
I'll make sure she gets them.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.924
Lily! Are you okay?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.963
- It's okay, Mom.
- If you're not feeling well--

05:59.059 --> 06:01.559
It'll only be a minute.
Come on.

06:10.371 --> 06:11.741
What are you even saying?

06:11.839 --> 06:13.709
I can't be worried
about my girlfriend?

06:13.807 --> 06:15.937
I'm not your girlfriend
anymore, Scott.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.013
So I'm just not supposed
to care about you?

06:18.112 --> 06:19.282
I told you I'm fine.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.510
I know I screwed up.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.384
You screwed Bobby's sister.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.123
I was drunk.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.578
You were stupid.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.946
Look, Lily,

06:28.055 --> 06:29.515
this is
our last summer together.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.393
In the fall,
I'm gonna go to Harvard and--

06:31.492 --> 06:33.132
You really like saying that,
don't you?

06:33.227 --> 06:35.687
I don't wanna
leave things on a bad note.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.296
You already have.

06:37.398 --> 06:41.068
There must be something
I can do.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.368
Actually, yeah.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.336
Don't talk to me.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.471
Lily!

06:52.312 --> 06:53.982
Fine.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.756
He just showed up at your house?

07:11.865 --> 07:14.765
That's not creepy or anything.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.768
He said he wanted to make sure
I was okay

07:16.870 --> 07:19.400
and that he didn't
end things on a bad note.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.006
Blah, blah, blah.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.478
I hope you told him
what to go do with himself.

07:23.577 --> 07:26.177
I'll say this. He would never
have risked his neck for me

07:26.280 --> 07:29.780
like that other guy did.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.323
I wonder why that guy
didn't go to the police though.

07:32.419 --> 07:35.649
I'm sure he had his reasons.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.256
I'm just glad he was there.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.358
I mean, think about it.

07:40.461 --> 07:43.331
The guy that attacked me
could have had a knife or a gun.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.630
I mean, he would have had
no idea.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.002
Yeah, it's just that
it was really convenient,

07:48.101 --> 07:49.601
don't you think?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.903
Him being all the way out there
in the middle of nowhere

07:52.005 --> 07:53.435
at just the right time?

07:56.777 --> 08:00.347
I'm just gonna consider myself
lucky and leave it at that.

08:00.447 --> 08:05.277
Besides, he was really cute.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.045
[laughs]

08:07.154 --> 08:08.824
Finally, the truth comes out.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.962
There's nothing wrong
with that, right?

08:12.059 --> 08:14.229
I don't know.
You tell me.

08:14.328 --> 08:18.158
Well, I'm never gonna
see him again anyway, so...

08:18.265 --> 08:19.965
But if you did?

08:20.067 --> 08:23.637
[laughs]
I would say thank you.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.967
That's all, huh?

08:26.073 --> 08:28.873
It is our last summer
before college.

08:28.976 --> 08:32.976
Our last chance to be reckless,
irresponsible teenagers.

08:33.080 --> 08:37.580
And with my parents in Europe,
that deserves a toast.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.585
Oh, my gosh.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.359
What?

08:44.458 --> 08:45.718
I think that's him.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.530
The guy that attacked you?

08:48.629 --> 08:51.759
No, the guy that saved me.

09:01.608 --> 09:04.178
Excuse me! Hi, uh...

09:04.278 --> 09:06.778
It's you, right?
From the park yesterday?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.110
I never got a chance
to thank you.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.376
I just did what
anyone would have done.

09:11.485 --> 09:15.245
I'm not so sure about that,
actually.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.385
I'm Lily.
Lily Becker.

09:17.491 --> 09:18.391
Mick Grant.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.062
It's nice to meet you.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.530
Officially.

09:21.628 --> 09:23.728
How are you? Hurt?

09:23.830 --> 09:27.470
No. Actually, I got off
pretty easy, thanks to you.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.568
- Yeah?
- I did break my MP3 player,

09:30.671 --> 09:32.071
but it could have been
a lot worse.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.305
Good.

09:36.310 --> 09:39.610
I've never seen you around.
Do you live in the neighborhood?

09:39.713 --> 09:40.913
Staying down at the marina.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.814
Like on a boat?

09:42.916 --> 09:45.046
Friends of the family
work there.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.222
They let me dock
whenever I'm in town.

09:47.321 --> 09:48.621
How about you?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.822
Oh, yeah. I just live
up the hill there.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.064
Sanderson Drive.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.859
[whistles]
Nice houses up there.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.434
So is it really him?

09:59.533 --> 10:00.833
This is my best friend Kelly.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.504
Hi. I'm Mick.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.603
So, Mick, how come
you didn't go to the police?

10:04.705 --> 10:06.465
Kelly!

10:06.540 --> 10:09.470
I didn't want to get involved
in some big investigation.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.136
I really didn't even get
a good look at the guy.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.984
I just kind of scared him off.
That's all.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.851
Well, you don't have to
if you don't feel comfortable.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.320
But if you do decide
you want to,

10:19.419 --> 10:22.189
Charles, the detective,
he's a good friend of my mom's.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.759
He's not gonna give you
the third degree.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.257
He just wants to hear
what you have to say.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.090
I'll think about it, okay?

10:28.195 --> 10:29.685
It was nice to meet you.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.696
Oh, wait!

10:31.798 --> 10:33.828
If I wanted to get ahold of you?

10:33.934 --> 10:35.604
Here.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.675
Slip 12, end of the marina.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.477
Anytime.

10:45.579 --> 10:47.679
Great, thanks.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.446
Well?

10:50.550 --> 10:51.720
You're right.
He's cute.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.148
Would I lie?
Did you see his arms?

10:54.254 --> 10:56.524
I bet he's got a six-pack.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.163
You think he really lives
on that boat?

10:59.259 --> 11:00.859
Well, that's what he said.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.131
A little odd, don't you think?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.060
I don't know.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.265
I think it's interesting.

11:09.302 --> 11:12.202
You owe me for lunch,
by the way.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.255
LILY: Mom?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.558
In here.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.160
Wait, listen to this.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.432
"Detective Petty had no idea

11:37.531 --> 11:39.861
that the slight suspect sitting
in the interrogation room

11:39.966 --> 11:42.196
was actually the killer
she'd spent months hunting."

11:42.302 --> 11:43.772
That's great, Mom.
I found him.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.040
- Who?
- The guy that saved me.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.669
Are you sure it was him?

11:47.774 --> 11:49.514
Yes. Kelly and I saw him
at the coffee shop.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.609
Turns out he's staying
on a boat in the marina.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.012
His name's Mick.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.883
- So you talked to him.
- Mm-hmm.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.921
And did he say why
he didn't go to the police?

11:57.017 --> 11:58.717
Now you sound like Kelly.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.519
Well, it's a fair question,
don't you think?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.390
I just don't think
he wants the attention.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.759
But I did ask him
to talk to Charles.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.458
And?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.960
- He said he'd think about it.
- Huh.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.332
Mom, he didn't have
to do anything.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.857
He could have
just stayed out of it.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.225
Then what would have happened?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.733
I know.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.195
Besides, he says
he didn't even see the guy.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.903
He just ran off.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.244
Yeah, but if there's
any chance of catching him--

12:20.340 --> 12:22.110
I already said he said
he would think about it.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.139
I can't make him do something
he doesn't want to do.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.444
[phone ringing]

12:25.545 --> 12:28.245
But he really did seem
like a nice guy.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.808
You should answer that.
It could be your editor.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.346
Okay.

12:32.986 --> 12:33.986
Hello?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.917
Hey. It's Charles.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.162
Hi, Charles.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.157
Any update on Lily's case?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.559
Well, we're still waiting
for the DNA test

12:41.661 --> 12:42.891
to get back from the lab,

12:42.996 --> 12:45.226
but I thought
you might want to know

12:45.332 --> 12:50.402
that the gentleman that saved
your daughter just came in.

12:50.504 --> 12:51.944
Oh.

12:52.038 --> 12:54.738
Yeah, unfortunately,
he didn't see much,

12:54.841 --> 12:56.671
but you never know.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.077
<i> Every detail counts.</i>

12:58.178 --> 12:59.838
Yeah, well that's really
nice to hear.

12:59.946 --> 13:04.146
Well, I'll call you as soon
as I'm done here, okay?

13:04.251 --> 13:06.621
Thank you so much, Charles.
I really appreciate it.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.150
<i> - Okay, great.</i>
<i> -</i> Bye.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.515
What'd he say?

13:09.623 --> 13:11.593
Well, it looks like
your new friend

13:11.691 --> 13:15.431
is at the police station
right now talking to him.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.959
Good.

13:18.064 --> 13:21.034
I wish there was more
I could tell you, Detective.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.504
That's really all I know.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.343
Okay, well,
if you remember anything else,

13:26.439 --> 13:28.709
please contact me
immediately, huh?

13:28.809 --> 13:30.509
- Of course.
- You know, Mick,

13:30.610 --> 13:36.710
I would never advise a citizen
to engage a violent offender,

13:36.817 --> 13:40.847
but off the record,
I am friends with the family,

13:40.954 --> 13:44.064
so I commend you
for your bravery.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.027
Thanks.
I appreciate that.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.687
Had you not shown up,

13:48.795 --> 13:50.995
there's no telling what
this psycho might have done.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.227
That's it then?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.473
That's it.

13:55.569 --> 13:58.169
Oh, but, I do have
to have you fingerprinted.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.871
It's just a standard procedure.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.644
Anyone who's involved in an
active case, we have to do it.

14:03.743 --> 14:06.143
Sure.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.446
You remember anything else,
no matter how insignificant.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.147
You got it.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.624
Hey, you really think they'll
be able to catch this guy?

14:17.724 --> 14:19.724
Certainly gonna do our best.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.238
- [twig snaps]
- [bird chirps, wings flutter]

14:37.344 --> 14:38.944
Hello?

14:39.045 --> 14:40.775
Who's there?

14:42.949 --> 14:44.419
Kelly.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.377
Scott. Jeez,
you scared me to death.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.716
I need your help.

14:47.821 --> 14:49.051
Too bad.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.415
Kelly, please.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.963
You're in my way.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.628
You know Lily
better than anyone.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.427
I know that she doesn't want
anything to do with you.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.729
What were you thinking, showing
up at her house like that?

14:58.832 --> 15:00.132
What was I supposed to do?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.903
She wasn't answering
any of my calls.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.802
You really want my advise?
Leave her alone.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.905
Who is he, Kelly?

15:07.007 --> 15:08.707
Who?

15:08.808 --> 15:11.938
The guy at the café.
I saw you two talking to him.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.945
Wow. Graduated
to stalker already.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.078
Is Lily seeing him?

15:16.182 --> 15:17.552
You want to know who he is?

15:17.651 --> 15:20.121
Okay, fine.
His name's Mick Grant.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.546
He's the guy who saved
Lily's life yesterday.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.716
You know, the guy that was there
when she needed him,

15:24.824 --> 15:27.834
not the one off sleeping with
the first girl who'd say yes.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.058
So she is seeing him.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.762
What if she is?

15:30.864 --> 15:33.164
Who is he then? I know
he's not from around here.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.666
Does anyone know
anything about him?

15:34.768 --> 15:38.068
I know he's twice the man
you are.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.441
I'm just worried about Lily.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.410
[scoffs]
She'll be fine.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.679
You sure?

15:45.211 --> 15:47.681
Just stop calling her.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.504
[ringing]

16:13.606 --> 16:15.936
Ray Peterson Investigations.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.482
- Ray.
-<i> Speaking.</i>

16:17.577 --> 16:18.677
Scott Ellison.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.038
Scott!

16:20.146 --> 16:22.646
How you been?
How's your dad?

16:22.749 --> 16:25.449
He's pretty busy, trying
to close up this new deal.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.392
<i> He asked me</i>
<i> to give you a call.</i>

16:27.487 --> 16:29.817
Anything for your dad.
How can I help?

16:29.923 --> 16:33.163
He'd like background information
on one of the parties.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.259
"Mick Grant."

16:40.734 --> 16:42.834
Got it. I'm on it.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.966
Tell your dad
not to worry about a thing.

16:45.071 --> 16:46.741
Thanks.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.761
I can do this.

17:23.877 --> 17:24.837
<i> [screaming]</i>

17:55.414 --> 17:59.954
[panting]

18:01.921 --> 18:03.521
LILY: I tried to run again
this morning.

18:03.623 --> 18:05.523
I barely made it home.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.325
KELLY: <i> You didn't expect things</i>
<i> would get better overnight,</i>

18:07.426 --> 18:08.886
<i> did you?</i>

18:08.995 --> 18:11.135
I just thought if I got
back on the horse, you know?

18:11.179 --> 18:13.849
Maybe you should see someone.

18:13.949 --> 18:15.779
You mean like a shrink?

18:15.884 --> 18:17.484
I mean like someone to talk to.

18:17.586 --> 18:20.516
I just need time.

18:20.622 --> 18:23.092
<i> You don't need</i>
<i> to push yourself.</i>

18:23.191 --> 18:25.831
- I just hate being afraid.
- [text alert]

18:25.927 --> 18:32.367
One sec.

18:32.467 --> 18:33.967
That was Scott.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.299
It's the fifth time
he's texted today.

18:36.404 --> 18:38.874
If he loves you so badly,

18:38.974 --> 18:40.644
he shouldn't have
cheated on you.

18:40.742 --> 18:42.942
[door opens]

18:43.044 --> 18:44.714
Hold on.

18:56.644 --> 18:58.214
I thought I saw something.

18:58.312 --> 19:00.082
Like what?

19:00.180 --> 19:01.950
I guess it was nothing.

19:02.049 --> 19:02.949
Don't scare me.

19:03.050 --> 19:04.220
I'm fine.

19:04.318 --> 19:06.118
Everything's okay.

19:06.220 --> 19:08.790
<i> [doorbell rings]</i>

19:08.856 --> 19:09.786
Somebody's here.

19:09.890 --> 19:11.560
<i> I'll call you back.</i>

19:20.668 --> 19:22.398
Mick?

19:22.503 --> 19:24.103
I was in the neighborhood.
I hope you don't mind.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.304
- How did you know where I live?
- Google.

19:26.407 --> 19:28.567
Sanderson Drive, remember?

19:28.676 --> 19:31.436
Well, who is this?

19:31.545 --> 19:34.415
This is Mick,
the guy I was telling you about.

19:34.515 --> 19:36.285
- And this is my mom.
- Jennifer.

19:36.383 --> 19:39.253
- Mick.
- Please come in.

19:39.353 --> 19:41.223
Thank you.

19:41.322 --> 19:43.692
I brought you something.

19:46.694 --> 19:48.364
You mentioned
you broke your old one,

19:48.429 --> 19:50.029
so I thought
you might like a new one.

19:50.130 --> 19:52.130
Wow. Thank you.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.802
And I would like
to thank you personally

19:54.902 --> 19:57.002
for what you did
for my daughter.

19:57.104 --> 19:59.004
You're welcome.

19:59.106 --> 20:01.806
- Hey, can we get a picture?
- Yeah.

20:01.875 --> 20:07.115
Oh, that's really--
I'd really rather not.

20:07.214 --> 20:08.984
It's just a picture.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.983
I know, but I'm a little
uncomfortable.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.446
Being the hero
is not really my thing.

20:14.555 --> 20:16.625
- Can he stay for dinner?
- Of course.

20:16.724 --> 20:18.964
Oh, no.
Really, it's not necessary.

20:19.059 --> 20:20.489
I'll just pick something up
on the way home.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.734
- Mom, please?
- It is the least I can do

20:22.830 --> 20:24.830
for the man that saved
my daughter's life.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.632
What do you say, Mick?

20:26.734 --> 20:28.104
I'd be honored.

20:28.202 --> 20:29.272
Good.

20:37.277 --> 20:40.337
[phone rings]

20:40.447 --> 20:41.377
Hello.

20:41.482 --> 20:44.052
Scott? Ray Peterson.

20:44.151 --> 20:46.051
Ray? I didn't expect
to hear from you so soon.

20:46.153 --> 20:47.493
<i> I aim to please.</i>

20:47.588 --> 20:48.688
What'd you find out?

20:48.789 --> 20:50.219
I have to admit,

20:50.324 --> 20:53.624
I have never seen anything
quite like this.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.897
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

21:05.005 --> 21:06.705
So, Mick,

21:06.807 --> 21:10.367
Lily tells me that you have
a yacht in the marina.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.937
It's not exactly
a yacht, but--

21:13.047 --> 21:14.947
- That's where you live, right?
- For now.

21:15.049 --> 21:17.779
It's kind of cool
if you think about it.

21:17.885 --> 21:21.295
If I ever get tired of the view,
I just move to a new one.

21:21.388 --> 21:24.688
Free spirit marches to the beat
of his own drum.

21:24.792 --> 21:26.392
I would love that.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.893
I mean, getting to go wherever
I want, whenever I want.

21:28.996 --> 21:32.556
[phone rings]

21:32.666 --> 21:33.856
[ringing continues]

21:35.669 --> 21:37.899
Thank God you came along
when you did.

21:38.005 --> 21:40.405
That's what the detective
was saying.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.437
Sounds like he's pretty close
to you guys.

21:42.543 --> 21:43.813
Yeah.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.241
He helped me with research
a while back

21:45.345 --> 21:47.115
from a law enforcement
perspective,

21:47.214 --> 21:48.614
and we've been friends
ever since.

21:48.715 --> 21:50.085
Maybe more.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.554
- Lily.
- [Lily laughs]

21:52.653 --> 21:54.653
No, but really,
he's been very helpful

21:54.755 --> 21:56.895
since we've been on our own.

21:56.990 --> 22:00.760
So, Mick, what about you?
Where are you from originally?

22:00.861 --> 22:02.231
East Coast.

22:02.329 --> 22:03.989
New Hampshire, Rhode Island.

22:04.098 --> 22:05.498
My dad was in the navy,

22:05.599 --> 22:07.829
so always being
reassigned somewhere.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.435
Is he still serving?

22:09.536 --> 22:13.236
No, um...

22:13.340 --> 22:17.340
My mom and dad passed away
a couple of years ago.

22:17.444 --> 22:19.244
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

22:19.346 --> 22:20.846
You didn't know.

22:20.948 --> 22:24.148
But I guess I inherited
my love of the ocean from him.

22:25.285 --> 22:28.995
Um, so I'm just curious,

22:29.089 --> 22:31.859
with your sailing from place
to place and traveling,

22:31.959 --> 22:33.189
how do you make a living?

22:33.293 --> 22:34.193
Mom!

22:34.294 --> 22:35.764
Just curious.

22:35.863 --> 22:37.603
Well, can he not enjoy
a nice dinner

22:37.698 --> 22:39.258
without an interrogation?

22:39.366 --> 22:41.326
He did save me, remember?

22:41.435 --> 22:42.805
You can't blame me
for being curious.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.343
I'm a mother.
That's what we do.

22:44.438 --> 22:48.368
It's okay, Lily.
When my parents passed away,

22:48.475 --> 22:50.315
they left me
a fair amount of money.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.540
Recently, I've been trying
my hand at writing.

22:52.646 --> 22:54.036
Is that right?

22:54.148 --> 22:57.818
Mm-hmm.
Short stories mostly, poems.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.148
My mom's a writer.

22:59.253 --> 23:02.353
Really? What kind?

23:02.456 --> 23:03.886
True crime mostly.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.321
Wow.

23:05.392 --> 23:07.792
I think it's kind of morbid.

23:07.895 --> 23:09.295
Okay.

23:09.396 --> 23:11.226
No, I think
it's a fascinating subject.

23:11.331 --> 23:15.301
I mean, having
to explore your stories,

23:15.402 --> 23:18.142
looking over all the evidence.

23:18.238 --> 23:20.968
I gotta ask,
as someone just starting out,

23:21.074 --> 23:22.374
what's your secret?

23:22.476 --> 23:24.006
You really want to know?

23:24.111 --> 23:25.211
Yes.

23:25.279 --> 23:27.809
An old Regal typewriter.

23:27.915 --> 23:29.255
You're kidding.

23:29.349 --> 23:31.979
Yeah. My father bought me one
at a garage sale

23:32.085 --> 23:33.685
when I was in high school,

23:33.787 --> 23:35.587
and everything I've ever done
has been written on it.

23:35.689 --> 23:36.649
It's true.

23:36.757 --> 23:38.017
You're not afraid?

23:38.125 --> 23:40.225
There's no hard drive,
no backups.

23:40.327 --> 23:41.987
Hemingway wrote with a pencil.

23:42.095 --> 23:44.405
She does use a scanner, so...

23:44.498 --> 23:46.928
Yes, so I'm not
a complete Luddite.

23:47.034 --> 23:47.934
[laughs]

23:48.035 --> 23:49.435
Well, that's awesome.

23:49.536 --> 23:51.396
You're very lucky, you know.

23:51.505 --> 23:54.845
Not many people get to make
a living doing what they love.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.725
Sorry about Sherlock Holmes
in there.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.757
Guess that's the hazard
of having a true crime writer

24:15.862 --> 24:16.762
as your mom.

24:16.863 --> 24:18.963
Elementary, my dear lady.

24:19.066 --> 24:20.626
You were really great with her
in there.

24:20.734 --> 24:22.574
She's hated everybody else
I've brought home.

24:22.669 --> 24:23.899
Everyone, huh?

24:24.004 --> 24:25.904
Not like I've had
a lot of them.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.206
Right, of course.

24:28.308 --> 24:31.238
Hey, have lunch with me
tomorrow.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.615
Really?

24:32.713 --> 24:34.453
Yeah, you can
show me around town.

24:34.548 --> 24:36.108
I'll show you my boat.

24:36.216 --> 24:38.816
What do you say?

24:38.919 --> 24:39.879
12:00?

24:39.987 --> 24:42.247
You know where to find me.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.786
Good night, Lily.

24:50.831 --> 24:55.671
He seems like a nice boy,
and I think he likes you.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.137
Come on.

25:20.661 --> 25:21.931
Hello?

25:22.029 --> 25:23.889
Hey.

25:23.997 --> 25:25.497
Permission to come aboard?

25:25.599 --> 25:27.669
Hell yes.

25:38.345 --> 25:39.585
Thank you.

25:39.680 --> 25:41.710
- Whoop!
- Careful!

25:41.815 --> 25:43.815
You're always saving me.

25:49.489 --> 25:51.789
So you gonna
give me the tour?

25:51.892 --> 25:54.092
You got thirty seconds?

25:54.194 --> 25:56.364
Well, this is the deck.

25:56.463 --> 25:59.263
That's the bridge up there,
and if you'll kindly follow me,

25:59.366 --> 26:01.066
I'll show you
the spacious living quarters.

26:01.168 --> 26:03.368
[laughs]
Okay.

26:07.641 --> 26:09.811
Voila.

26:09.910 --> 26:13.040
It may not look like much,
but it's enough.

26:13.146 --> 26:15.106
Are those...

26:15.215 --> 26:17.825
All the places
I've been so far. Yeah.

26:17.918 --> 26:19.448
You're lucky, you know?

26:19.553 --> 26:21.453
Getting to travel
anywhere you want,

26:21.555 --> 26:23.055
wherever the current takes you,

26:23.156 --> 26:25.656
no one telling you what to do
or how to do it.

26:25.759 --> 26:27.789
Okay, there, Kerouac.

26:27.894 --> 26:29.334
[laughs]

26:29.429 --> 26:33.559
No, but it does get
a little lonely, you know?

26:33.667 --> 26:35.567
I mean, you got your mom.

26:35.669 --> 26:36.969
I've got a boat.

26:37.070 --> 26:39.270
Well, your boat doesn't
interrogate guys

26:39.373 --> 26:40.503
who come over for dinner.

26:40.607 --> 26:44.007
You'd be surprised.

26:44.111 --> 26:46.311
I mean, maybe if it wasn't
just the two of us.

26:46.413 --> 26:48.283
Her and me.

26:48.382 --> 26:52.682
After the divorce,
she just got overly cautious.

26:56.623 --> 26:58.323
Is this your writing?

26:58.425 --> 27:01.165
It's a work in progress.

27:03.263 --> 27:08.503
But talking to your mom
really inspired me.

27:08.602 --> 27:11.342
You gonna read
some of her books?

27:11.438 --> 27:13.168
Well, according to Amazon,
I'm supposed to start with

27:13.273 --> 27:15.113
<i> The Double Murder</i>
<i> of Crown Hill.</i>

27:15.208 --> 27:17.978
Yeah, that's her big bestseller.

27:18.078 --> 27:19.808
You know, we lived in Seattle
for over a year

27:19.913 --> 27:21.353
- while she wrote it?
- Really?

27:21.448 --> 27:23.178
It was a big case up there.

27:23.283 --> 27:25.323
The guy supposedly killed
his business partner

27:25.419 --> 27:26.819
and his girlfriend.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.350
Some kind of embezzlement deal.

27:28.455 --> 27:30.055
- Wow.
- Yeah.

27:30.157 --> 27:32.157
You know she actually helped
them catch the guy, right?

27:32.259 --> 27:33.519
Seriously?

27:33.627 --> 27:34.987
It was just a cold case
when she found it,

27:35.095 --> 27:37.365
but while she was
doing her research,

27:37.464 --> 27:40.064
she uncovered evidence that
the homicide detective missed,

27:40.167 --> 27:42.197
so that convinced
the Seattle PD

27:42.302 --> 27:44.032
to reopen
the whole investigation.

27:44.137 --> 27:46.637
Wow. You must be proud.

27:46.740 --> 27:50.470
Yeah. I just wish
it wasn't all so...

27:50.577 --> 27:51.807
Morbid?

27:51.912 --> 27:54.312
Right.

27:56.783 --> 27:58.323
So, uh, lunch.

27:58.418 --> 28:01.148
Right, lunch.

28:07.127 --> 28:09.927
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

28:10.030 --> 28:13.560
What were you doing
in the woods

28:13.667 --> 28:15.767
the day I was attacked?

28:15.869 --> 28:19.169
Sometimes when I have
writer's block, I like to walk.

28:19.272 --> 28:22.042
Clears my head.

28:22.142 --> 28:24.912
You know, I can't help
thinking though.

28:25.011 --> 28:26.481
Maybe it was fate.

28:27.714 --> 28:29.414
Yeah?

28:29.516 --> 28:33.616
I mean, like your mom said,
if I hadn't been there...

28:33.720 --> 28:35.890
I thought you were
Mr. Seat of Your Pants,

28:35.989 --> 28:37.189
follow the moment.

28:37.290 --> 28:40.290
Stick around.
You may be surprised.

28:41.628 --> 28:43.128
I already am.

28:46.867 --> 28:48.397
- Um...
- Too soon, huh?

28:48.502 --> 28:50.072
Maybe.

28:50.136 --> 28:52.436
You just let me know
when you're ready.

28:52.539 --> 28:54.539
Sure.

28:54.641 --> 28:56.371
Let's go.

29:11.691 --> 29:13.521
- Mick?
- Yeah?

29:13.627 --> 29:15.387
I'm ready now.

30:13.904 --> 30:15.574
"The end."

30:18.809 --> 30:20.469
Whew.

30:27.184 --> 30:29.324
[doorbell rings]

30:33.824 --> 30:35.894
Sorry, Scott, but Lily
is not here right now.

30:35.993 --> 30:38.533
Actually, I'm not here
to see her.

30:38.629 --> 30:40.289
I had a friend of my dad's
run a background check

30:40.397 --> 30:41.927
on Mick Grant.

30:42.032 --> 30:43.702
Do you have any idea
how many boundaries

30:43.801 --> 30:45.571
you are violating right now?

30:45.669 --> 30:47.799
Please. Don't tell me you're not
just a little bit curious.

30:47.905 --> 30:49.745
Okay, I'm sure somebody
with your family connections

30:49.840 --> 30:51.440
isn't used to hearing
the word no too often--

30:51.542 --> 30:53.112
You and I both want
the same thing here:

30:53.210 --> 30:55.910
for Lily to be safe.

30:56.013 --> 30:57.913
Fine. What did you find out?

30:58.015 --> 31:00.725
He didn't go to school,
he's never had a job,

31:00.818 --> 31:02.548
he's never even gotten
a parking ticket.

31:02.653 --> 31:03.623
So he's clean.

31:03.721 --> 31:05.391
More like he doesn't exist.

31:05.489 --> 31:08.619
I'm still not sure how
any of this is your business.

31:08.726 --> 31:10.456
Aren't you just
a little bit concerned

31:10.561 --> 31:12.391
that we don't know anything
about this guy?

31:12.496 --> 31:14.726
- Nothing.
- I appreciate your concern,

31:14.832 --> 31:16.902
and I will take that
into consideration.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.430
Come on.
You and I both know

31:18.535 --> 31:20.075
I'm better for Lily
than he is.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.740
You know what I know?
What a broken heart looks like.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.410
And not even
your family connections

31:24.508 --> 31:25.738
can fix what you did to her.

31:25.843 --> 31:27.313
She's making a mistake.

31:27.411 --> 31:28.681
Goodbye, Scott.

31:30.214 --> 31:31.754
Fine.

32:02.279 --> 32:03.609
What happened?

32:03.714 --> 32:05.454
A couple of kids took a walk
through the park

32:05.549 --> 32:08.219
and found our friend
lying down over here.

32:08.318 --> 32:11.888
Well, I don't recognize him.

32:11.989 --> 32:13.849
"Eric Grissom."

32:16.093 --> 32:17.763
Came in from the valley.

32:19.763 --> 32:22.863
You know the homeless population
rises ten percent around here

32:22.966 --> 32:24.896
during the summer months?

32:27.404 --> 32:29.374
Whoa! Top shelf.

32:29.473 --> 32:32.373
I can't even afford
to drink this.

32:32.476 --> 32:33.806
You think he drank himself
to death?

32:33.911 --> 32:35.381
Maybe.

32:35.479 --> 32:37.209
I hate seeing this.

32:37.314 --> 32:40.084
The guy probably lost his job,

32:40.150 --> 32:42.720
got thrown out on the streets
and ends up like this.

32:42.820 --> 32:44.720
What's the world coming to?

32:44.822 --> 32:46.252
You're so sensitive.

32:46.323 --> 32:48.363
I haven't had my coffee yet.

32:48.459 --> 32:51.589
- Any sign of foul play?
- Nothing so far.

32:53.330 --> 32:54.530
Hi, Mom.

32:54.631 --> 32:56.701
- [door closes]
- Scott came by today.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.630
Let me guess.

32:58.735 --> 33:00.635
He hasn't heard back from me,
so he's worried about me.

33:00.737 --> 33:01.937
Something like that?

33:02.039 --> 33:04.469
He ran a background check
on Mick.

33:07.177 --> 33:10.037
- Wow! Jealous much?
- He's got a point.

33:10.147 --> 33:12.507
I mean, how much do we really
know about this guy?

33:12.616 --> 33:15.176
I know he's not a spoiled rich
kid who throws a tantrum

33:15.285 --> 33:18.325
just because somebody has
the audacity to tell him no.

33:18.422 --> 33:20.552
It's a legitimate question,
Lily.

33:20.657 --> 33:22.257
Here's a thought.

33:22.359 --> 33:25.159
How about we stop focusing
on the guy who saved me,

33:25.262 --> 33:27.732
and start looking into
the guy who attacked me?

33:27.831 --> 33:30.261
Look, I'm on your side here,
but you need to make sure

33:30.367 --> 33:33.467
that you're not starting
something for the wrong reasons.

33:33.537 --> 33:36.967
I didn't realize saving my life
was the wrong reason.

33:37.074 --> 33:39.314
Just take a look.

33:44.481 --> 33:47.851
You've got to admit,
it's pretty bare.

33:47.951 --> 33:50.851
He lives on a boat.
He's off the grid. So what?

33:50.954 --> 33:53.424
Just because somebody lives
their life differently than you

33:53.524 --> 33:55.264
does not make them
a bad person.

33:55.359 --> 33:57.389
Oh, for God's sake, Lily.

33:57.494 --> 34:01.964
Mom, I'm sorry Dad left you
for somebody half your age,

34:02.065 --> 34:04.875
but if you're looking to fix
somebody, look in the mirror.

34:04.968 --> 34:06.328
I don't need your help.

34:13.510 --> 34:16.780
I swear it's like
I finally find a guy,

34:16.880 --> 34:18.449
and everybody's out to get him.

34:18.549 --> 34:20.609
[sighs]
I wouldn't say that.

34:20.717 --> 34:22.246
<i> What would you call it?</i>

34:22.351 --> 34:24.121
Your mom's just
looking out for you, Lil.

34:24.221 --> 34:27.221
And Scott? She's actually
gonna take him seriously?

34:27.324 --> 34:29.664
She does have a point though.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.360
Who lives their lives
in complete secrecy like that?

34:32.429 --> 34:35.659
So he's different.
That's what I like about him.

34:35.766 --> 34:38.926
And you don't think
he's hiding something?

34:39.036 --> 34:42.496
Hiding what?
He was a nice guy.

34:42.606 --> 34:46.106
<i> He gave me a tour of his boat,</i>
<i> and we went out to lunch.</i>

34:46.208 --> 34:49.309
He was a perfect gentleman.

34:50.746 --> 34:52.746
You kissed him, didn't you?

34:52.849 --> 34:54.619
Okay, what does that
have to do with anything?

34:54.717 --> 34:56.118
You did!

34:56.219 --> 34:59.419
Fine. Maybe a little.

34:59.523 --> 35:01.593
Look, I'm not gonna tell you
to stay away from him,

35:01.692 --> 35:04.262
but if you're gonna
start getting serious,

35:04.361 --> 35:06.591
<i> promise me you'll be careful?</i>

35:06.697 --> 35:09.257
I promise. I will.

35:09.366 --> 35:10.896
Bye.

35:22.879 --> 35:24.549
Jeez, you scared me.

35:24.615 --> 35:26.485
Where are you off to so early?

35:26.583 --> 35:28.183
Coffee with Kelly.

35:28.285 --> 35:30.855
Kelly, huh?

35:30.921 --> 35:33.121
Yes, Kelly.

35:33.223 --> 35:35.823
Look, I know you're mad at me,
but you do realize

35:35.926 --> 35:38.726
that I'm just trying
to look out for you, right?

35:38.829 --> 35:41.199
You don't believe me.
Do you want to come?

35:41.298 --> 35:43.158
No.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.126
Can we have a hug?

35:48.305 --> 35:51.715
Mm, that's better.

35:51.808 --> 35:54.478
When you see Kelly,
tell her I say hi, okay?

35:54.578 --> 35:56.238
I will.

36:13.897 --> 36:15.327
[text alert]

36:18.502 --> 36:19.602
[text alert]

36:53.970 --> 36:55.640
What the hell, Scott?

36:55.739 --> 36:57.069
Lily, hi.

36:57.174 --> 36:58.444
I want to know what
gives you the right

36:58.542 --> 37:00.042
to do something like this.

37:00.143 --> 37:01.613
Look, clearly you're upset.

37:01.712 --> 37:04.282
I told you we were through.

37:04.381 --> 37:05.951
Wow.

37:12.089 --> 37:13.919
Let go of me!

37:14.024 --> 37:16.794
You've got to understand
I'm just looking out for you.

37:16.893 --> 37:18.393
By showing up to my house

37:18.495 --> 37:20.665
and talking about me
behind my back with my mom?

37:20.764 --> 37:22.664
You're not answering my texts,
you're not taking my calls.

37:22.766 --> 37:24.426
What am I supposed to do?

37:24.534 --> 37:26.734
You're supposed to take a hint.

37:26.837 --> 37:28.667
I'm not just gonna sit back
and let you ruin your life.

37:28.772 --> 37:31.442
I didn't know dating you
defined my life.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.141
The guy lives in a boat, Lily!

37:33.243 --> 37:35.183
What kind of a future do you
really think you can have

37:35.278 --> 37:36.608
with someone like that?

37:36.713 --> 37:38.813
At least he knows
how to treat a woman.

37:38.915 --> 37:40.815
I never said I was perfect,

37:40.917 --> 37:42.877
but I can do a hell of
a lot better than Mick Grant.

37:42.953 --> 37:44.853
Why do you always
make me feel like a trophy

37:44.955 --> 37:48.365
in some testosterone-driven
competition?

37:48.458 --> 37:51.488
I know I messed up, okay?
I was stupid. I get it.

37:51.595 --> 37:54.535
Let me make it up to you.

37:54.631 --> 37:56.131
Why don't we go down
to my family's place in Cabo

37:56.233 --> 37:57.303
for the weekend?

37:57.400 --> 37:59.330
Just you and me.

37:59.436 --> 38:01.296
You're really something,
aren't you?

38:01.404 --> 38:04.244
You know, one day you're gonna
regret how you treated me.

38:07.711 --> 38:09.441
- Hey.
- Mick?

38:09.546 --> 38:12.376
Why you don't you
leave Lily alone, okay?

38:12.482 --> 38:14.012
Oh, yeah?

38:14.117 --> 38:16.517
What happens if I say no, huh?

38:16.620 --> 38:18.320
You gonna make me?

38:18.421 --> 38:19.891
Scott!

38:19.990 --> 38:22.290
Look, buddy,
I just came here to talk.

38:22.392 --> 38:25.632
Just to talk. A little out of
your league, don't you think?

38:25.729 --> 38:29.329
I think Lily made her feelings
toward you quite clear.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.402
Oh, and she's chosen you,
is that it?

38:31.501 --> 38:33.501
You should respect
her decisions.

38:33.603 --> 38:36.503
Maybe I'm not gonna let her make
the biggest mistake of her life.

38:36.606 --> 38:38.166
Then go back to your friends.

38:38.275 --> 38:40.975
[laughs]
You're funny.

38:41.077 --> 38:43.907
- He's funny.
- Scott!

38:44.014 --> 38:46.554
Why don't you get back in
your boat and get out of town?

38:46.650 --> 38:48.620
I told you, leave her alone!

38:48.718 --> 38:50.118
Guys!

38:59.029 --> 39:00.259
Stop it!

39:00.363 --> 39:02.503
Oh, Lily, I'm so sorry.

39:02.599 --> 39:03.859
It was an accident.

39:03.967 --> 39:05.097
Lily!

39:10.307 --> 39:11.807
Are you okay?

39:13.210 --> 39:14.170
Yeah.

39:14.277 --> 39:15.837
You're shaking.

39:15.946 --> 39:19.346
I think-- I think
I just need to go lay down.

39:19.449 --> 39:21.079
Let me give you a ride.

39:21.184 --> 39:22.684
I just want to be alone.

39:22.786 --> 39:25.186
Come on. Let's at least
get that looked at.

39:25.288 --> 39:28.458
I'll be fine, really.

39:28.558 --> 39:29.858
Call you later, okay?

39:29.960 --> 39:32.460
Yeah, sure.

39:51.214 --> 39:53.614
[yells]

39:53.717 --> 39:58.487
[panting]

40:01.825 --> 40:04.225
KELLY: So it was an accident?

40:04.327 --> 40:07.257
I think so.

40:07.364 --> 40:08.964
Ow!

40:09.065 --> 40:11.905
Look, either you let me do this,
or you let your mom do it.

40:12.002 --> 40:13.102
Fine.

40:13.169 --> 40:14.839
What about Mick?

40:14.938 --> 40:16.898
What about Mick?

40:17.007 --> 40:18.967
He get hurt?
He fight back? What?

40:19.075 --> 40:23.945
[sighs]
Well, Scott was just kinda...

40:24.047 --> 40:27.047
throwing punches,
and Mick just...

40:27.117 --> 40:28.977
kinda knocked
the crap out of him.

40:29.085 --> 40:31.855
So he started it?

40:31.955 --> 40:33.925
Scott threw the first punch.

40:34.024 --> 40:36.094
But Mick escalated it.

40:36.192 --> 40:38.032
I guess.

40:38.128 --> 40:39.658
Lily...

40:39.763 --> 40:42.333
- I know.
- I know you like this guy,

40:42.432 --> 40:44.132
and I've already told you
to be careful.

40:44.234 --> 40:45.804
I gotta go.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.632
It's gonna swell up.
You should keep ice on it.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.767
Okay. Thank you for your help.

40:49.873 --> 40:52.313
Take care, okay?

40:52.409 --> 40:55.179
I will.

40:55.278 --> 40:56.938
[sighs]

41:15.231 --> 41:18.101
JENNIFER: Lily, some flowers
came for you.

41:25.742 --> 41:27.042
Lily?

41:33.326 --> 41:36.126
Got it!
I'll be in my room, Mom!

41:37.797 --> 41:41.337
[shower running]

41:49.276 --> 41:51.446
[sobbing]

42:01.888 --> 42:03.988
- Scott.
- What are you doing here?

42:04.090 --> 42:05.920
I heard about what happened
at the country club.

42:06.026 --> 42:07.296
It was an accident.

42:07.394 --> 42:09.264
It's not what it
looked like to me.

42:09.362 --> 42:11.432
You don't believe me,
ask anyone who was there.

42:11.531 --> 42:14.601
I'd never hurt Lily,
and you know that. I love her.

42:14.701 --> 42:17.261
You sure have a funny way
of showing it.

42:17.370 --> 42:19.800
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

42:19.906 --> 42:22.746
I wanted to talk to you
about Mick.

42:22.842 --> 42:25.142
You really think
he could be dangerous?

42:25.245 --> 42:28.915
The guy shows up out of nowhere,
no past, no history,

42:29.015 --> 42:32.085
and he just so happens to be in
the woods when Lily is attacked?

42:32.185 --> 42:34.525
You tell me.

42:34.621 --> 42:36.851
Is there anything we know
about him for sure?

42:36.957 --> 42:39.097
It's what we don't know
about him that's the problem.

42:39.192 --> 42:40.992
He's hiding something,
and I know it.

42:41.094 --> 42:43.624
But Lily won't listen to me
and neither will her mother.

42:43.730 --> 42:45.490
Can you blame them?

42:47.367 --> 42:49.267
You know, someone's
gonna get hurt here.

42:49.369 --> 42:52.429
I just hope it's not Lily.

42:52.539 --> 42:54.029
Scott, wait.

42:54.140 --> 42:56.140
You want to help her,
get her away from him.

42:56.243 --> 42:58.613
He's trouble.

42:58.712 --> 43:00.672
Good luck.

43:47.027 --> 43:50.367
[phone ringing]

43:50.463 --> 43:52.763
Hello?

43:52.866 --> 43:54.936
I told you. It's coming.

43:55.035 --> 43:57.105
I just finished.

43:57.203 --> 43:59.103
It's in the scanner now.
Will you relax?

43:59.205 --> 44:00.535
It's gonna be good.

44:00.640 --> 44:03.170
All right, check in
about it tomorrow, okay?

44:03.276 --> 44:04.576
Bye.

44:16.189 --> 44:17.919
Mom?

44:29.569 --> 44:30.699
Mom?

44:33.473 --> 44:34.503
Mom?

44:36.509 --> 44:39.939
Mom, are you okay?

44:48.021 --> 44:50.551
Mom? Mom!

44:50.657 --> 44:51.657
Mom, are you--

44:54.160 --> 44:55.360
[dialing]

44:55.462 --> 44:56.792
[siren blares]

45:07.340 --> 45:09.300
You're sure you didn't
get a good look at him?

45:09.409 --> 45:10.869
No, he was wearing a mask.

45:10.977 --> 45:13.077
We found this in the office.

45:16.716 --> 45:19.816
Get this over to cyber forensics
immediately.

45:19.919 --> 45:21.649
You tell them
to get it unlocked.

45:21.755 --> 45:23.225
Yes, sir.

45:25.358 --> 45:28.698
Mom, how are you doing?

45:28.795 --> 45:30.025
I'm fine.

45:30.130 --> 45:31.660
And how are you?

45:31.765 --> 45:33.795
I'm okay.

45:33.900 --> 45:36.200
I didn't get a really
good look at anything.

45:36.302 --> 45:37.772
- Let me see your face.
- It's nothing.

45:37.871 --> 45:39.501
It's not nothing.
What happened?

45:39.606 --> 45:41.976
- I said it's nothing.
- Did somebody do that to you?

45:42.075 --> 45:45.945
No, of course not, I just--
I fell in a parking lot.

45:46.045 --> 45:47.675
It's no big deal.

45:48.815 --> 45:50.515
Was it Mick?

45:50.617 --> 45:52.217
No, Mom, it wasn't Mick.

45:52.318 --> 45:53.688
Then why don't you tell me
what happened?

45:53.787 --> 45:55.457
Because I don't want
to talk about it!

45:55.555 --> 45:57.655
Lil, if somebody hit you,

45:57.757 --> 46:02.297
it is very important
that you tell me who it was.

46:02.395 --> 46:03.765
Who hit you?

46:06.166 --> 46:07.866
Scott Ellison.

46:07.967 --> 46:10.367
But he didn't mean to.
It was just an accident.

46:10.470 --> 46:12.470
The paramedics are here.

46:18.178 --> 46:19.378
Come on.

46:19.479 --> 46:21.379
Let's get you to a hospital.

46:21.481 --> 46:23.681
Thank you.

46:23.783 --> 46:25.053
Come on, you too.

46:25.151 --> 46:27.011
Come on.

46:31.458 --> 46:35.298
I'm gonna send our guy out here
to upgrade your alarm system.

46:40.834 --> 46:42.734
What have you got for us, CJ?

46:42.836 --> 46:46.006
I was able to break the code
and get into the phone.

46:46.105 --> 46:47.535
Able to identify the owner?

46:47.640 --> 46:50.600
Scott Ellison,
but that's not all.

46:54.180 --> 46:56.010
Whoa, whoa!
What am I looking at here?

46:56.115 --> 46:58.585
According to that
date and time stamp,

46:58.685 --> 47:01.785
these were taken just before
Lily was attacked.

47:05.158 --> 47:06.628
He was watching her.

47:09.929 --> 47:12.929
That son of a bitch
is going down.

47:18.171 --> 47:20.301
I have no idea
what they're talking about!

47:20.406 --> 47:22.406
I didn't go anywhere
near their house!

47:22.509 --> 47:24.369
Don't say anything.

47:24.477 --> 47:26.147
I was down at the country club
all night.

47:26.212 --> 47:27.372
I'm sure they've got cameras.

47:27.480 --> 47:28.610
You better have
a damn good reason,

47:28.715 --> 47:29.985
embarrassing my client
like this.

47:30.083 --> 47:31.713
How about evidence
on his cell phone

47:31.818 --> 47:33.718
linking him
to two separate attacks?

47:33.820 --> 47:35.280
I don't even know
where my phone is.

47:35.388 --> 47:36.728
I lost it somewhere
earlier today.

47:36.823 --> 47:38.723
Oh, yeah,
isn't that convenient.

47:38.825 --> 47:41.055
I already have calls in
to the sheriff and the mayor.

47:41.160 --> 47:43.960
Ah, well, send them my best.

47:53.573 --> 47:56.403
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

47:56.509 --> 47:57.939
You really don't have
to do all of this.

47:58.044 --> 48:00.144
It's fine. I want to.

48:00.246 --> 48:01.816
Strawberry or marmalade?

48:01.915 --> 48:03.485
Strawberry.

48:03.583 --> 48:04.653
Thanks, Mom.

48:04.751 --> 48:06.911
You got it, kiddo.

48:07.020 --> 48:08.180
[doorbell rings]

48:09.222 --> 48:10.882
I'll be back.

48:17.463 --> 48:19.263
- Morning, Lily.
- Morning.

48:19.365 --> 48:21.605
- Is your mother up?
- She's in the kitchen.

48:21.701 --> 48:24.361
JENNIFER: She's not decent!

48:24.437 --> 48:26.477
I just made some breakfast.
Do you want some coffee?

48:26.573 --> 48:28.903
No. No, thanks.

48:29.008 --> 48:32.018
Just came to share
some information with you.

48:37.917 --> 48:40.787
Oh, indecent, huh?

48:40.887 --> 48:42.557
Well, you could have called.

48:42.655 --> 48:46.125
Well, you know, I've never been
much for etiquette.

48:46.225 --> 48:47.965
Seriously, I just wanted
to come by

48:48.061 --> 48:49.891
and check on the two of you
in person,

48:49.996 --> 48:51.166
make sure you're okay.

48:51.264 --> 48:55.064
And, uh, I have a little news.

48:55.168 --> 48:57.468
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

48:57.570 --> 49:00.900
The phone that fell out of your
attacker's pocket last night,

49:01.007 --> 49:03.507
cyber forensics
was able to open it up.

49:03.610 --> 49:07.540
Turns out it belongs
to a Scott Ellison.

49:09.916 --> 49:11.716
- Scott?
- Yeah.

49:14.420 --> 49:16.920
Got some pictures on it
I think you'll find interesting.

49:21.361 --> 49:22.491
Oh, my God.

49:22.595 --> 49:24.195
In the trunk of his car,

49:24.297 --> 49:27.167
we found a mask and a hoodie
matching your description.

49:27.266 --> 49:28.866
Waiting for the DNA test
to come back,

49:28.968 --> 49:31.308
but pretty sure
we're gonna have a match.

49:34.641 --> 49:36.271
Oh, God.

49:40.013 --> 49:41.513
KELLY: It was Scott?

49:41.614 --> 49:43.944
Looks like it.

49:45.818 --> 49:48.288
[sighs] I knew the guy
had some issues,

49:48.388 --> 49:50.788
but nothing like this.

49:50.890 --> 49:52.120
You should have seen him
yesterday.

49:52.225 --> 49:53.625
He was like an animal.

49:53.726 --> 49:56.066
It was like he was possessed
or something.

49:56.162 --> 49:59.692
But still, attacking you?
Trying to kill your mom?

49:59.799 --> 50:01.459
It's a little over the top,
don't you think?

50:01.567 --> 50:05.407
They have pictures
on his phone.

50:05.505 --> 50:07.605
He's been stalking us
for a while.

50:07.707 --> 50:10.107
Just waiting for
the right opportunity, I guess.

50:10.176 --> 50:12.816
But why your mom?
It doesn't make any sense.

50:12.912 --> 50:15.642
She was pretty harsh with him
the other day

50:15.748 --> 50:17.818
when he brought her
that file on Mick.

50:17.917 --> 50:21.257
Lily, just think about it
for a minute.

50:21.354 --> 50:23.824
You've known Scott
since sixth grade.

50:23.923 --> 50:25.723
Does this sound like
something he would do?

50:25.825 --> 50:28.225
They say you can never really
know about people though.

50:28.327 --> 50:30.097
I mean, think about
all the people on the news

50:30.196 --> 50:32.096
who find out that
their nice, quiet neighbor

50:32.198 --> 50:33.838
is a serial killer.

50:33.933 --> 50:35.833
Like Mick?

50:37.170 --> 50:38.130
Kelly.

50:38.237 --> 50:40.177
I'm just saying.

50:40.273 --> 50:41.773
Mick is nothing like Scott.

50:41.874 --> 50:44.844
For your sake,
I hope you're right.

50:48.281 --> 50:52.011
I mean, there's just--
There's something about him.

50:52.118 --> 50:55.328
Something comforting.

50:55.421 --> 50:58.191
Lil, you've been through a lot
this week.

50:58.291 --> 51:00.321
Promise me you won't
rush into anything.

51:01.527 --> 51:03.527
You sound like my mom.

51:09.102 --> 51:10.762
I hope she's okay.

51:12.305 --> 51:14.205
The doctor said
she'd be fine, right?

51:14.307 --> 51:17.277
Yeah.

51:17.376 --> 51:20.116
I mean, I just keep thinking,
if I hadn't been there.

51:20.213 --> 51:21.683
But you were.

51:23.249 --> 51:26.379
Tell you what.
Why don't we go shopping?

51:26.486 --> 51:29.326
Get your mind off all this
for a couple of hours.

51:29.422 --> 51:33.022
Can I get a rain check?
I have to go.

51:33.126 --> 51:34.326
Where are you going?

51:34.427 --> 51:37.727
I want to check on Mom.

51:37.830 --> 51:41.190
I thought you said Charles
was staying with her.

51:41.300 --> 51:43.730
Yeah, but I want
to make sure she's okay.

51:43.836 --> 51:46.706
Okay. Call me
if you need anything.

51:46.806 --> 51:48.476
I will.

51:50.476 --> 51:51.846
Love you.

51:51.944 --> 51:53.714
Love you too.

52:00.286 --> 52:02.026
CK: Scott broke into
your house?

52:02.121 --> 52:05.491
I just keep seeing her
lying there like that.

52:05.591 --> 52:09.091
How could somebody
do something like that?

52:16.802 --> 52:20.572
But they-- they really think
it was him?

52:20.672 --> 52:24.072
They're still waiting on DNA,
fibers and that kind of stuff,

52:24.176 --> 52:27.436
but... looks like it.

52:27.893 --> 52:29.653
Wow.

52:29.762 --> 52:34.132
I could tell the guy
had a few issues, but...

52:34.233 --> 52:36.663
I just keep thinking back,

52:36.769 --> 52:40.739
I mean, to think he could do
such horrible things.

52:40.839 --> 52:43.839
I knew he was
possessive, but...

52:43.942 --> 52:44.912
[sobs]

52:45.010 --> 52:48.480
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

52:48.580 --> 52:51.520
At least he's where
he belongs now, right?

52:55.187 --> 52:56.687
Yeah.

53:03.629 --> 53:06.869
How about your mom?
How's she doing?

53:06.965 --> 53:08.765
She's better.

53:08.867 --> 53:10.367
She's at home.

53:10.469 --> 53:12.969
Charles is gonna stay there
for a little while.

53:10.769 --> 53:12.809
Good.

53:12.905 --> 53:16.935
These past 24 hours
have been so crazy.

53:17.042 --> 53:19.272
I just feel like
I need a break, you know?

53:22.114 --> 53:25.544
Why don't you stay here
for a bit, hmm?

53:25.651 --> 53:29.011
I mean, like you said,
it's all been so crazy.

53:29.121 --> 53:34.221
Wouldn't it be nice to just
get away for a few hours?

54:07.126 --> 54:09.526
Hello?

54:09.628 --> 54:12.598
Is this
the harbormaster's office?

54:12.698 --> 54:14.568
Hi. I was wondering
what I need to do

54:14.667 --> 54:18.907
to check on the registration
of a boat in your harbor?

54:19.004 --> 54:21.004
It's slip 12.

54:41.994 --> 54:43.554
What are you doing?

54:43.662 --> 54:46.392
Taking a selfie. Here.

54:46.498 --> 54:48.138
Say cheese.

54:49.368 --> 54:50.968
Really?

54:51.070 --> 54:55.280
I'd rather just enjoy the moment
while we're in it.

54:55.374 --> 54:57.034
Sure.

55:17.429 --> 55:19.229
[phone chiming]

55:21.033 --> 55:22.533
[scoffs]
Great.

55:31.710 --> 55:33.880
And there's a battery backup
in case you lose power.

55:33.979 --> 55:36.379
Great. Thank you so much.

55:36.482 --> 55:37.882
- Hey.
- Hi.

55:37.983 --> 55:39.513
You look like
you're feeling better.

55:39.618 --> 55:40.988
I am.

55:41.086 --> 55:42.156
What happened to four?

55:42.254 --> 55:43.884
It's only five.

55:43.989 --> 55:47.159
Yeah, that's an hour later
than we agreed.

55:47.259 --> 55:48.959
I'm sorry.
Thank you so much.

55:47.517 --> 55:49.477
No problem.
Call if there's any issues.

55:49.586 --> 55:51.886
I will. I appreciate it.

55:53.723 --> 55:54.853
So where were you?

55:54.958 --> 55:56.018
I was out.

55:56.126 --> 55:57.326
Out?

55:57.427 --> 56:00.027
Fine. I was with Mick
on his boat.

56:00.130 --> 56:01.660
- Happy?
- Mick's boat.

56:01.798 --> 56:03.098
Yeah. It was no big deal.

56:03.199 --> 56:04.529
We were just hanging out
for a little while.

56:04.634 --> 56:06.704
No big deal?
Lily, you barely know this guy.

56:06.803 --> 56:08.633
Mom, I'm 18.

56:08.738 --> 56:10.368
Yes, and after everything
that's happened,

56:10.473 --> 56:12.003
- I just thought--
- Thought what?

56:12.108 --> 56:14.938
I thought that you would
exercise better judgment.

56:15.044 --> 56:17.644
I am only trying
to look out for you.

56:17.747 --> 56:19.877
By telling me who I can
and can't hang out with?

56:19.983 --> 56:23.283
If you are incapable of making
smart decisions, then yes.

56:23.386 --> 56:24.886
Okay, I'm leaving
in a couple of months.

56:24.988 --> 56:26.218
Are you gonna
follow me to school

56:26.322 --> 56:27.652
and make sure
every decision I make

56:27.757 --> 56:29.217
is up to your standards?

56:29.325 --> 56:30.265
Lily--

56:30.360 --> 56:32.020
Just stop!

56:37.467 --> 56:39.227
She just doesn't get it.

56:39.335 --> 56:42.135
You don't think you might be
rushing into this too quickly?

56:42.238 --> 56:44.068
<i> Especially after</i>
<i> the last couple of weeks?</i>

56:44.174 --> 56:45.874
I'm not rushing into anything.

56:45.975 --> 56:47.815
You still don't know a lot
about the guy.

56:47.911 --> 56:51.041
I know how I feel.

56:51.147 --> 56:52.877
<i> Yeah, but that</i>
<i> background report,</i>

56:52.982 --> 56:54.582
<i> it was a little iffy, right?</i>

56:54.684 --> 56:56.584
And he doesn't like it
when you take his picture?

56:56.686 --> 56:57.686
What's up with that?

56:57.787 --> 56:59.347
So he's a little camera shy.

56:59.455 --> 57:01.355
That doesn't make him
a bad guy.

57:01.457 --> 57:03.757
No, but it is really weird.

57:03.860 --> 57:05.720
Okay, you remember
that date with Andrew

57:05.828 --> 57:07.258
that you had to sneak out for?

57:07.363 --> 57:08.393
<i> Who covered for you?</i>

57:08.498 --> 57:10.028
This is not the same thing.

57:10.133 --> 57:11.503
Nobody liked him but me.

57:11.601 --> 57:13.501
I was the only one,
who stood up for you.

57:13.603 --> 57:18.003
He was Debbie C's brother.
This is a complete stranger.

57:20.877 --> 57:24.037
[sighs]
Hey, you're my best friend.

57:24.147 --> 57:26.007
I'm entitled to be worried
about you.

57:26.115 --> 57:28.355
Okay.

57:28.451 --> 57:30.651
I'm gonna go to bed.
I'll call you tomorrow.

57:30.753 --> 57:32.283
You bet.

57:42.465 --> 57:46.335
Okay, Lily, you owe me one.

58:47.990 --> 58:51.190
Okay, Mick Grant, let's find out
who you really are.

59:39.341 --> 59:40.901
Oh, boy.

59:46.181 --> 59:47.641
"Michael Granger"?

59:54.523 --> 59:56.253
Oh, my God.

59:56.358 --> 59:58.198
He's the son?

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:03.538
[screams]

01:00:03.632 --> 01:00:05.862
- [coughs]
- [grunts]

01:00:05.968 --> 01:00:08.608
[phone ringing]

01:00:08.704 --> 01:00:11.704
<i> - [line ringing]</i>
- Come on, Kelly, answer.

01:00:13.308 --> 01:00:15.808
Kelly? Hello?

01:00:15.911 --> 01:00:17.841
<i> [Kelly gasping]</i>

01:00:17.946 --> 01:00:19.176
Kelly, are you there?

01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:56.386
Kelly!

01:00:56.485 --> 01:00:59.155
Kelly! Kelly.

01:01:06.261 --> 01:01:07.291
Kelly!

01:01:10.499 --> 01:01:11.699
Kelly.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.560
Kelly!

01:01:22.811 --> 01:01:24.911
What were you doing?

01:01:34.122 --> 01:01:37.092
He stepped away for a couple
of minutes at about 8:15,

01:01:37.192 --> 01:01:38.522
but that's it.

01:01:41.363 --> 01:01:44.233
So there's no way he was
the one that attacked Jennifer.

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:47.563
Got the results back on
the DNA test from Lily's attack.

01:01:47.669 --> 01:01:50.139
- We have a match?
- Yes, but not to Scott Ellison.

01:01:50.238 --> 01:01:51.538
What do you mean?

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.640
It matches
an aggravated assault arrest

01:01:53.742 --> 01:01:55.302
two years ago
up in Moorpark.

01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:57.810
Suspect was a vagrant,
Eric Grissom.

01:01:57.913 --> 01:02:01.243
Wait, the homeless guy
that we found in the park?

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:04.580
We still have
his possessions in impound?

01:02:04.686 --> 01:02:06.386
Yes.

01:02:06.488 --> 01:02:09.558
We need to check that bottle
that he had for fingerprints.

01:02:09.658 --> 01:02:11.828
- What, that top-shelf Tequila?
- That's right.

01:02:11.927 --> 01:02:14.227
You think someone hired him
to attack Lily?

01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:15.969
I think something
doesn't make sense.

01:02:16.064 --> 01:02:17.964
We printed Mick Grant
when he came in.

01:02:18.066 --> 01:02:20.136
Run his prints
against that bottle.

01:02:20.235 --> 01:02:21.835
- I'm on it.
- [phone ringing]

01:02:21.937 --> 01:02:23.977
Cyber forensics.

01:02:24.072 --> 01:02:26.532
Yes, he's here.

01:02:28.243 --> 01:02:31.643
Lily Becker's here to see you.
She says it urgent.

01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:37.489
It was terrible.
It was like she couldn't breath.

01:02:37.586 --> 01:02:40.426
And you haven't heard
or seen anything since?

01:02:40.522 --> 01:02:42.852
Do you think something
could have happened to her?

01:02:42.958 --> 01:02:44.528
Do you know
where her parents are?

01:02:44.626 --> 01:02:46.766
In Europe. I think they get back
in a few days,

01:02:46.862 --> 01:02:48.262
but I'm not sure exactly when.

01:02:48.363 --> 01:02:49.963
Any way of contacting them?

01:02:50.065 --> 01:02:51.695
No.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.500
Why? What are you thinking?

01:02:53.602 --> 01:02:56.772
Lily, we have evidence
clearing Scott.

01:02:56.872 --> 01:02:58.232
We think
that your friend Mick

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:01.070
may have tried
to have him set up.

01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:05.112
Do you think
he did something to Kelly?

01:03:05.213 --> 01:03:07.113
No. We're not gonna
jump to any conclusions,

01:03:07.215 --> 01:03:11.455
but what I want you to do
is write down Kelly's number,

01:03:11.553 --> 01:03:13.353
and I'm gonna
track her cell phone.

01:03:13.455 --> 01:03:16.655
[phone ringing]

01:03:16.758 --> 01:03:19.328
It's him.

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:21.328
- Lily, don't pick--
- Where is she?

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:22.990
Where is who, Lily?

01:03:23.098 --> 01:03:25.638
I swear, if you've
done anything to hurt her...

01:03:25.734 --> 01:03:27.404
What are you talking about?

01:03:27.502 --> 01:03:28.732
Kelly!

01:03:28.837 --> 01:03:32.337
Mick, this is
Detective Jenkins.

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:34.671
<i> Where are you?</i>

01:03:34.776 --> 01:03:36.576
We know everything, Mick.

01:03:39.681 --> 01:03:41.341
Things will go
a lot easier for you

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:43.310
if you turn yourself in
peacefully.

01:03:49.524 --> 01:03:51.054
Mick.

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:53.250
Where's your mother?

01:03:53.361 --> 01:03:54.361
She's at home.

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:55.963
She's still recovering.

01:03:57.532 --> 01:03:58.992
CHARLES: Officer Collins?

01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:02.566
Yes, sir.

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:05.079
This is Officer Collins.

01:04:05.173 --> 01:04:06.603
I'm gonna have him
drive you home

01:04:06.708 --> 01:04:08.678
to keep an eye on you
and your mother, okay?

01:04:08.777 --> 01:04:10.517
I'm not going home.
I have to find Kelly.

01:04:10.612 --> 01:04:12.672
I need you to do
exactly what I tell you to do.

01:04:12.781 --> 01:04:14.441
- He's gonna keep you both safe.
- Don't worry.

01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:17.059
I can stay outside
all night long in my car,

01:04:17.152 --> 01:04:18.582
if that's what it takes.

01:04:18.687 --> 01:04:20.087
What about you?

01:04:20.188 --> 01:04:21.958
I'm gonna do my best
to find your friend.

01:04:24.693 --> 01:04:26.753
Charles, I got the results
on the fingerprints

01:04:26.862 --> 01:04:28.462
from Grissom's bottle.

01:04:28.563 --> 01:04:32.263
You were right. They match
the ones we took from Grant.

01:04:32.367 --> 01:04:34.737
All right.
I want you to run his mug shot.

01:04:34.836 --> 01:04:36.906
We did a background check.
Nothing came up.

01:04:37.005 --> 01:04:38.775
Exactly. I want you
to run his photo

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:41.304
to see if it matches
any other names in the database.

01:04:41.409 --> 01:04:44.219
While you're at it, ping this
cell phone number, okay?

01:04:44.312 --> 01:04:45.872
You got it.

01:04:45.981 --> 01:04:48.541
I promise you, I'm gonna
do my best to find Kelly,

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:51.980
but my main concern is keeping
you and your mother safe,

01:04:52.087 --> 01:04:53.887
all right?

01:04:53.989 --> 01:04:55.459
Let me know when you get there.

01:04:55.557 --> 01:04:58.197
Yes, sir.
It's okay, Lily. Come on.

01:05:01.563 --> 01:05:03.493
I told you, those charges
were complete BS.

01:05:03.598 --> 01:05:04.968
Yeah, I just got home.

01:05:05.066 --> 01:05:06.636
I'm dying to get out
of these clothes.

01:05:06.735 --> 01:05:08.805
But hey, let's meet up later
and go out.

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:11.770
I've got some serious
celebrating to do.

01:05:11.873 --> 01:05:13.103
Okay, see ya.

01:05:13.208 --> 01:05:15.108
[text alert]

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.610
Oh, this'll be good.

01:05:21.716 --> 01:05:24.656
CHARLES: <i> I need an APB</i>
<i> on a Mick Grant.</i>

01:05:24.753 --> 01:05:28.523
<i> 20-year-old Caucasian male.</i>
<i> Brown hair, hazel eyes.</i>

01:05:28.623 --> 01:05:32.153
<i> 5'10",</i>
<i> approximately 150 pounds,</i>

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.660
<i> to be approached</i>
<i> with extreme caution.</i>

01:05:59.087 --> 01:06:00.927
Mick Grant!

01:06:01.022 --> 01:06:02.682
Police!

01:06:09.931 --> 01:06:11.591
Police!

01:06:14.736 --> 01:06:16.336
Mick?

01:06:16.438 --> 01:06:18.638
Don't do anything stupid.

01:06:29.084 --> 01:06:32.084
Mick, come out slowly.

01:06:35.256 --> 01:06:37.326
Not gonna tell you again, son.

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:40.297
All right.

01:06:47.302 --> 01:06:49.132
You son of a bitch.

01:07:09.824 --> 01:07:11.854
Ray, what do you got for me?

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.260
Something good, I hope.

01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:18.261
Ray?

01:07:18.366 --> 01:07:19.496
Hey.

01:07:26.841 --> 01:07:29.371
Oh, my God.

01:07:29.477 --> 01:07:31.277
You had to get nosy,
didn't you?

01:07:31.379 --> 01:07:33.249
What? I--
No, I don't know.

01:07:33.314 --> 01:07:35.184
You must think
I'm really stupid.

01:07:35.283 --> 01:07:38.683
Look, whatever's happening here,
I won't tell anyone.

01:07:40.755 --> 01:07:43.655
I swear, I don't know
what Lily ever saw in you.

01:07:43.758 --> 01:07:46.558
Did you do something to her?

01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:49.291
To Lily?

01:07:49.397 --> 01:07:51.637
I would never hurt her.

01:07:51.733 --> 01:07:55.333
I love her,
and she loves me.

01:07:57.605 --> 01:08:01.305
But you didn't know
when to stop.

01:08:01.409 --> 01:08:04.679
You had to keep fighting.

01:08:04.779 --> 01:08:07.619
Even though you must have known
in your heart,

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.516
you didn't have a chance.

01:08:09.617 --> 01:08:13.117
Look, I'm sure we can
work something out here.

01:08:13.221 --> 01:08:17.591
Oh, trying to make a deal, huh?
Just like your dad?

01:08:17.692 --> 01:08:21.622
I mean, there's always
a bargain to be struck, right?

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:24.660
What do you want?

01:08:24.765 --> 01:08:26.166
It's too late.

01:08:31.305 --> 01:08:33.206
You'll never get away with this.

01:08:33.308 --> 01:08:36.778
See, Scott,
here's the thing about that.

01:08:36.877 --> 01:08:39.848
When the cops come and find you
and your private detective here

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:43.287
dead in a murder-suicide,

01:08:43.384 --> 01:08:45.714
they're gonna
start investigating.

01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:48.550
You know
what they're gonna find?

01:08:48.656 --> 01:08:50.356
Hmm?

01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:52.457
They're gonna look
on our friend here's computer

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.689
and see that you paid him
to doctor some evidence,

01:08:56.798 --> 01:09:02.608
fudge some DNA results
to frame me.

01:09:04.005 --> 01:09:07.475
They'll never believe that.

01:09:07.575 --> 01:09:09.604
Only one way to find out.

01:09:13.948 --> 01:09:16.888
- No!
- [grunts]

01:09:38.473 --> 01:09:40.943
<i> [police radio chatter]</i>

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.020
We should be out there
looking for Kelly.

01:09:55.123 --> 01:09:57.253
Not until Charles says
it's safe.

01:09:57.358 --> 01:09:59.928
Are we okay to stay here?

01:10:00.028 --> 01:10:02.268
Yes. As long as we have
that officer watching the house,

01:10:02.363 --> 01:10:03.493
we're okay.

01:10:04.866 --> 01:10:08.606
<i> [police radio chatter]</i>

01:10:15.376 --> 01:10:17.716
- I can't wait here anymore.
- Hey, stop.

01:10:17.812 --> 01:10:19.712
I am not letting you leave.

01:10:19.814 --> 01:10:22.314
- Mom--
- Please listen to me for once.

01:10:22.417 --> 01:10:24.887
It's not safe.
Charles said to stay here,

01:10:24.986 --> 01:10:26.586
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

01:10:26.688 --> 01:10:28.728
[knocking]

01:10:28.823 --> 01:10:30.823
- Is it him?
- Shh.

01:10:30.925 --> 01:10:32.825
MICK: Lily!
Let me in, please.

01:10:32.927 --> 01:10:35.967
I promise,
I'll explain everything.

01:10:36.064 --> 01:10:38.464
All you have to do
is open the door.

01:10:38.566 --> 01:10:39.636
Go away!

01:10:39.734 --> 01:10:41.434
Mrs. Becker, please.

01:10:41.536 --> 01:10:44.236
Go away!

01:10:46.674 --> 01:10:47.944
Where's Officer Collins?

01:10:48.042 --> 01:10:49.842
I don't know. I'll check.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:53.310
Do you see him?

01:11:01.756 --> 01:11:03.526
Oh, my God.

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:05.295
- Go to your room!
- Mom, what did you see?

01:11:05.393 --> 01:11:06.993
Lock the door!
Just do what I say!

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:25.048
<i> You've dialed 911.</i>

01:11:25.146 --> 01:11:27.546
<i> Your call will be answered</i>
<i>by the next available operator.</i>

01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:29.589
Oh, God.

01:11:29.684 --> 01:11:32.114
- [knocking]
- JENNIFER: It's me.

01:11:35.757 --> 01:11:37.357
Listen to me.

01:11:37.458 --> 01:11:39.158
Every door is locked,

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:41.920
but 911 is busy, so I'm gonna
try the house phone.

01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:45.230
I will be right back, okay?
I'm right outside this door.

01:11:48.169 --> 01:11:50.539
[phone ringing]

01:11:50.638 --> 01:11:52.208
Kelly.

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:55.007
Where have you been?
I've been so worried about you.

01:11:55.143 --> 01:11:56.903
Whatever they told you about me
is a lie.

01:11:58.746 --> 01:12:02.116
<i> Lily? I know</i>
<i> you're listening to me.</i>

01:12:02.183 --> 01:12:03.443
What do you want?

01:12:05.787 --> 01:12:07.527
We had plans, remember?

01:12:07.622 --> 01:12:09.852
We were gonna go away
together.

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:13.658
I was gonna take you away
from all this.

01:12:13.761 --> 01:12:15.291
Just let me in.

01:12:16.764 --> 01:12:19.434
- Where's Kelly?
-<i> Lily...</i>

01:12:19.534 --> 01:12:21.034
Where is she?

01:12:21.135 --> 01:12:23.765
Just let me in,
and I'll tell you.

01:12:23.871 --> 01:12:27.031
<i> Come on. I wouldn't hurt you.</i>

01:12:27.141 --> 01:12:28.701
You love me.

01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:30.270
<i> Don't you?</i>

01:12:30.378 --> 01:12:32.178
Did you kill her?

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.210
Answer the question, Lily.

01:12:36.317 --> 01:12:38.957
Do you love me?

01:12:41.889 --> 01:12:43.129
No.

01:12:46.027 --> 01:12:47.897
<i> Where's Kelly?</i>

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.260
Mick? Mick?

01:12:58.639 --> 01:12:59.709
Mick?

01:13:00.942 --> 01:13:02.272
[gasps]

01:13:05.747 --> 01:13:07.587
This is all my fault.

01:13:07.682 --> 01:13:09.412
No, this is not your fault.

01:13:09.517 --> 01:13:10.957
[distant knocking]

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.520
It may be Charles.

01:13:14.622 --> 01:13:16.852
Okay. Shh.

01:13:28.903 --> 01:13:30.133
Jennifer, it's me.

01:13:30.238 --> 01:13:31.938
Oh, thank God.

01:13:32.974 --> 01:13:34.274
[beeping]

01:13:35.443 --> 01:13:36.343
Are you okay?

01:13:36.444 --> 01:13:38.614
Yeah. Oh, thank God.

01:13:40.581 --> 01:13:42.441
[beeping]

01:13:56.416 --> 01:13:58.746
The lights went out,
and the cop outside is dead.

01:13:58.852 --> 01:14:02.152
I know, I know. I saw.
Don't worry. I'm here now.

01:14:02.255 --> 01:14:04.025
There's no way
this punk can hurt you.

01:14:04.124 --> 01:14:05.764
Backup's gonna be here
any minute.

01:14:05.859 --> 01:14:07.759
Any news on Kelly?

01:14:09.462 --> 01:14:13.102
I'm sorry, Lil.
I found her on Mick's boat.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:15.229
She's dead?

01:14:15.335 --> 01:14:17.575
There's nothing
we can do about it now.

01:14:17.671 --> 01:14:19.671
You've checked every window?
Every door is locked?

01:14:19.773 --> 01:14:20.673
- Yeah, like I said.
- Okay.

01:14:25.245 --> 01:14:27.585

LILY: Do you see him?

01:15:31.945 --> 01:15:34.445
What is taking him so long?

01:15:34.547 --> 01:15:36.177
It's my fault.

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:38.822
- No, it's not.
- I told him I didn't love him.

01:15:38.918 --> 01:15:41.948
Listen to me. We are gonna
get through this, okay?

01:15:42.055 --> 01:15:44.425
I should have lied.
Maybe he would have left.

01:15:44.524 --> 01:15:47.324
It's gonna be okay.
You just stay here.

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:51.332
Charles told us both
to stay here.

01:15:51.431 --> 01:15:53.531
I just need to check.

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:01.910
Charles?

01:16:02.942 --> 01:16:03.942
Charles?

JENNIFER: Oh, my God.

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:52.790
Mom, is he in the house?

01:16:52.892 --> 01:16:54.762
Come on. Let's go.

01:16:59.332 --> 01:17:03.832
Go to your room, lock the door,
and try calling 911 again.

01:18:28.288 --> 01:18:29.818
[mumbles]

01:18:29.923 --> 01:18:31.323
Oh, my God!

[panting]

01:18:33.927 --> 01:18:36.357

Get me untied.

<i> Your call will be answered</i>
<i>by the next available operator.</i>

01:18:44.804 --> 01:18:46.374
Hi.

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:48.472
[screams]

01:18:48.575 --> 01:18:51.215
Did you really think I was gonna
leave here without you?

01:18:51.311 --> 01:18:53.711
I'm not going anywhere with you.

01:18:53.813 --> 01:18:55.313
You don't understand.

01:18:55.415 --> 01:18:57.185
Your mother took my father
away from me,

01:18:57.283 --> 01:18:59.283
so now I have to
take you away from her.

01:18:59.385 --> 01:19:02.355
Your father?
What are you talking about?

01:19:02.455 --> 01:19:05.065
Oh, come on, Lily.
You know all about it.

01:19:05.158 --> 01:19:09.658
My father,
the Crown Hill Killer?

01:19:09.762 --> 01:19:11.832
Everybody had
forgotten about it,

01:19:11.931 --> 01:19:13.031
forgotten about him,

01:19:13.132 --> 01:19:16.472
until your mother
wrote the book.

01:19:16.569 --> 01:19:18.639
Your father killed those people.

01:19:18.738 --> 01:19:22.308
My father was a good man!

01:19:22.408 --> 01:19:25.108
He just had a moment.

01:19:26.479 --> 01:19:32.079
One little moment
in 55 perfect years.

01:19:32.185 --> 01:19:35.055
Did you know they finally
executed him last year?

01:19:35.154 --> 01:19:38.894
It took him ten minutes to die.
You believe that?

01:19:38.992 --> 01:19:42.362
Ten minutes he lied there
on the table

01:19:42.462 --> 01:19:44.832
convulsing, shaking.

01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:47.231
[sobbing]
I didn't know.

01:19:47.333 --> 01:19:49.073
He tried to tell the executioner
what had happened,

01:19:49.168 --> 01:19:52.398
except he bit off
his own tongue.

01:19:52.505 --> 01:19:57.245
That is what your mother
did to us.

01:19:57.343 --> 01:20:00.083
She ruined his life.

01:20:00.179 --> 01:20:01.779
Our life.

01:20:01.848 --> 01:20:03.708
This was all about revenge?

01:20:03.816 --> 01:20:05.946
I knew the only way to make her
realize what she'd done

01:20:06.052 --> 01:20:08.592
was to hurt her
the way that she'd hurt us.

01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:12.519
<i> So I crafted a new identity</i>
<i> for myself,</i>

01:20:12.625 --> 01:20:15.895
<i> and I spent a lot of time</i>
<i> watching you.</i>

01:20:15.995 --> 01:20:19.505
<i> I knew exactly what to do</i>
<i> to get your attention.</i>

01:20:19.599 --> 01:20:21.559
Run!

01:20:25.505 --> 01:20:28.645
- The bitch bit me!
- Yeah, occupational hazard.

01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:30.711
Give me back my sweater.

01:20:32.312 --> 01:20:35.082
The body they found
in the park?

01:20:35.181 --> 01:20:37.411
They had DNA from the scene.

01:20:37.517 --> 01:20:39.517
I couldn't take any chances.

01:20:46.392 --> 01:20:49.992
<i> And then I found the perfect</i>
<i> person to take the fall.</i>

01:20:50.096 --> 01:20:52.426
All I had to do next was...

01:20:52.532 --> 01:20:56.202
<i>add a few incriminating photos,</i>

01:20:56.302 --> 01:20:59.402
<i> plant a little evidence.</i>

01:21:02.408 --> 01:21:04.538
<i> No one would ever know.</i>

01:21:06.579 --> 01:21:08.239
Except for Kelly.

01:21:10.016 --> 01:21:13.016
I couldn't let anything
get in the way of my plan.

01:21:13.119 --> 01:21:15.189
I owed my father that.

01:21:16.856 --> 01:21:18.516
And my mom?

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:21.324
Oh, I was never going
to kill her.

01:21:21.427 --> 01:21:25.127
No, no. Where's
the satisfaction in that?

01:21:25.231 --> 01:21:27.761
Making her believe
your ex-boyfriend tried to,

01:21:27.867 --> 01:21:30.697
that's something else
entirely.

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:32.203
JENNIFER: Lily!
[banging on door]
Lily!

01:21:32.305 --> 01:21:33.705
Lily!

01:21:33.806 --> 01:21:37.006
Lily, are you in there?

01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:38.170
- Lily!
- [banging continues]

01:21:38.277 --> 01:21:39.637
Lily, open the door!

01:21:39.779 --> 01:21:41.009
What do you want to do
about her?

01:21:41.114 --> 01:21:42.484
You leave her alone.

01:21:42.582 --> 01:21:44.852
She has to pay for what she did
to my family.

01:21:44.951 --> 01:21:45.881
- Lily!
- Mick, please.

01:21:45.985 --> 01:21:48.525
Lily! Lily!

01:21:48.621 --> 01:21:51.221
Lily! Lily, honey!

01:21:51.324 --> 01:21:53.664
I'll let you decide.

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.860
You can make it quick.

01:21:55.962 --> 01:21:56.992
No!

01:21:57.096 --> 01:21:59.896
- [banging continues]
- Lily!

01:21:59.999 --> 01:22:02.169
Fine.

01:22:02.268 --> 01:22:04.268
No!

01:22:08.641 --> 01:22:13.611
Lily, Lily!
Lily, can you hear me?

01:22:13.713 --> 01:22:15.113
Lily!

01:22:19.886 --> 01:22:21.546
No!

01:22:25.792 --> 01:22:26.822
No!

01:22:38.137 --> 01:22:38.997
[Mick screams]

01:22:39.105 --> 01:22:40.345
[Lily screams]

01:22:56.122 --> 01:22:57.092
[stab]

01:22:57.190 --> 01:22:59.790
[groans]

01:23:09.068 --> 01:23:11.768
You took everything from me.

01:23:11.871 --> 01:23:12.771
What?

01:23:12.872 --> 01:23:14.142
[grunts]

01:23:16.676 --> 01:23:17.806
- [yells]
- [gunshot]

01:23:24.217 --> 01:23:25.277
Oh.

01:23:25.384 --> 01:23:29.224
I had no idea.
Come here.

01:23:29.322 --> 01:23:31.052
We're okay.

01:23:31.157 --> 01:23:32.717
Charles!

01:23:32.825 --> 01:23:35.235
Charles!

01:23:35.328 --> 01:23:37.088
Hey.

01:23:37.196 --> 01:23:38.656
You okay?

01:23:38.764 --> 01:23:40.804
Call an ambulance.

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:41.900
Hey.

01:23:42.001 --> 01:23:43.771
Hey, it's okay.

01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:45.240
It's okay.

01:24:04.190 --> 01:24:07.960
Mom, what are you doing here?
You hate the sun.

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:09.830
Well, I wanted
to show you something.

01:24:09.929 --> 01:24:11.259
What?

01:24:11.364 --> 01:24:13.464
My publisher has offered
in the high six figures

01:24:13.566 --> 01:24:14.826
for the rights,

01:24:14.934 --> 01:24:16.974
so we are off to New York
in the morning.

01:24:17.069 --> 01:24:18.669
We?

01:24:18.771 --> 01:24:20.201
Well, he's never been,

01:24:20.306 --> 01:24:22.136
and since my publisher's
paying for it,

01:24:22.241 --> 01:24:24.541
figured I might as well
show him around.

01:24:24.644 --> 01:24:26.314
Well, thank you, ma'am.

01:24:26.412 --> 01:24:29.382
Aw. That's awesome.
Congratulations.

01:24:29.482 --> 01:24:31.612
And there's more news.

01:24:31.717 --> 01:24:33.647
When they announce my book
next week,

01:24:33.753 --> 01:24:35.183
I'm gonna make a statement

01:24:35.288 --> 01:24:37.518
saying that this is
my last true crime novel.

01:24:37.623 --> 01:24:39.463
- No, Mom!
- Yeah.

01:24:39.559 --> 01:24:41.719
You're right. It's morbid.
Time to try something else.

01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:44.827
Yeah, like romance novels.

01:24:44.931 --> 01:24:46.231
All right.

01:24:46.332 --> 01:24:48.872
Hey, you sure you're okay
with this?

01:24:48.968 --> 01:24:52.168
Yeah, as long as I get to pick
who plays me in the movie.

01:24:52.271 --> 01:24:54.141
- [giggles]
- I love you.

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.110
Love you too, Mom.
