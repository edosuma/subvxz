00:03.415 --> 00:04.590
Excuse me!

00:05.550 --> 00:06.616
I need help!

00:07.357 --> 00:08.582
Can you help me?

00:08.674 --> 00:11.276
I need money and I'm running out of time!

00:13.287 --> 00:14.772
Hey! Hey, this is important!

00:14.823 --> 00:15.818
Can you help me?

00:15.869 --> 00:17.267
I need money!

00:21.446 --> 00:24.486
You, you! I'm talking to you!
I need money!

00:26.010 --> 00:27.125
Allison!

00:27.357 --> 00:28.470
Hey, hey, hey!

00:28.782 --> 00:29.871
Help me!

00:30.100 --> 00:31.484
I need money!

00:32.313 --> 00:34.539
Give me money!
Give me money!

00:34.909 --> 00:36.530
Hey! Hey!

00:36.914 --> 00:39.083
- Allison!
- This is important!

00:39.864 --> 00:43.933
I need help! Can you help me?
I need money! I'm running out of time!

00:45.149 --> 00:46.605
This is important!

00:47.488 --> 00:50.358
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I can't talk now!

00:50.459 --> 00:51.784
I need money!

00:51.964 --> 00:53.802
I need money!

01:48.230 --> 01:51.098
How would you normally describe your quality of sleep?

01:51.730 --> 01:54.722
I mean, would you say your sleep is normally uneventful?

01:55.256 --> 01:58.395
Do you sleep through the night,
wake up rested, that sort of thing?

01:58.446 --> 02:02.022
Or are you one of those people
who wake up several times a night,

02:02.073 --> 02:03.200
tired, moody?

02:04.447 --> 02:05.511
Pretty normal.

02:08.674 --> 02:10.651
I suppose, yeah.
Pretty normal...

02:11.610 --> 02:12.554
kinda.

02:13.621 --> 02:16.187
And you don't remember how you got to the highway,

02:16.238 --> 02:18.289
why you were on the highway,
anything about the highway?

02:18.340 --> 02:20.965
All I remember is my husband
slapping me awake.

02:22.230 --> 02:23.428
I'll be right back.

02:30.493 --> 02:31.713
Look at it from my side...

02:31.764 --> 02:33.760
- Your side?! You keep acting as if...
- ...spoken to in three years

02:33.811 --> 02:35.508
- ...I've done something to you.
- is calling me to tell me...

02:35.559 --> 02:36.648
This has been done to me!

02:36.699 --> 02:38.513
...standing in the middle of a highway, half-naked!

02:38.564 --> 02:39.627
...no control over what happened tonight.

02:39.678 --> 02:40.743
I roll over, you're not there.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.386
...last thing I remember,
we were getting to bed.

02:42.437 --> 02:44.552
...wake up our 12-year-old daughter,
tell her, don't be scared,

02:44.603 --> 02:46.837
but for the next three hours,
you're going to be the oldest person in the house.

02:46.888 --> 02:48.921
Stop punishing me as if I've done something wrong!

02:48.972 --> 02:51.160
You scared the piss out of me, Allison!

02:54.513 --> 02:55.361
Okay...

02:55.953 --> 02:57.950
I'm pretty sure this will do the trick.

02:58.001 --> 03:00.837
Let's take these for the next week or two, just before bed.

03:00.888 --> 03:01.818
What are these?

03:01.911 --> 03:03.705
It's an anti-anxiety medication.

03:05.679 --> 03:08.127
It's okay; all your neighbors are taking it.

03:08.608 --> 03:10.410
That's what I thought this was.

03:11.786 --> 03:14.758
Look, we don't really understand what causes sleepwalking in adults,

03:14.809 --> 03:16.847
but there are usually two contributing factors:

03:16.898 --> 03:18.516
One, the victim is usually...

03:19.275 --> 03:20.292
Uh... the victim?

03:20.783 --> 03:22.211
And that would be me?!

03:22.678 --> 03:23.440
Yes, ma'am.

03:23.539 --> 03:26.871
The victim is usually wrestling with some kind of unresolved anxiety.

03:26.922 --> 03:28.670
Additionally, most sleepwalkers are people

03:28.721 --> 03:31.777
whose sleep is being disturbed on a fairly regular basis.

03:32.450 --> 03:33.664
I know you said otherwise,

03:33.715 --> 03:37.432
but it's entirely possible that it's happening and you're not even aware of it.

03:37.483 --> 03:39.383
Anyway, these pills should knock you out enough

03:39.434 --> 03:42.513
that you should sleep soundly and return to a normal sleep cycle.

03:42.564 --> 03:44.366
Forgive me, Doc, but that's it?

03:44.571 --> 03:47.279
A handful of Valium and "call me in the morning"?

03:47.821 --> 03:50.584
She didn't just sneak out in the backyard to look for the cat.

03:50.635 --> 03:52.394
She stood in the middle of a highway

03:52.445 --> 03:55.615
and tried to strike up a conversation with oncoming traffic.

03:56.414 --> 03:57.721
What about my anxiety?

03:58.157 --> 03:59.733
Do you have any suggestions?

04:00.740 --> 04:03.708
I suggest you lock all the doors and windows at night.

04:05.629 --> 04:08.555
Here; feel free to call me if you need anything else.

04:09.769 --> 04:12.384
"Nan has a new hat.

04:12.513 --> 04:15.607
"Nan's hat is made of wool.

04:15.681 --> 04:20.721
- "Nan's wool hat is red."
- Perfect!

04:20.773 --> 04:22.366
Yay! Bravo!

04:22.417 --> 04:23.908
Great.
Can I talk now?

04:23.959 --> 04:25.767
Want to hear me spell Nan?

04:25.851 --> 04:28.467
- I think Ariel is trying to...
- N-A-N. Nan.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.387
Mom...

04:29.771 --> 04:30.735
Hey, Bridgette...

04:31.427 --> 04:34.142
Yes, you can talk.
Anyone can talk whenever they want to.

04:34.193 --> 04:37.012
It just... it isn't polite
to talk when someone is reading.

04:37.063 --> 04:38.080
Ooh-yah.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.044
I want to walk home from school.

04:43.765 --> 04:45.770
Well, why would you want to do that?

04:45.821 --> 04:46.650
Why wouldn't I?

04:46.701 --> 04:48.550
We  live seven blocks from school.

04:48.862 --> 04:52.573
Besides, Hannah walks home from school every day, and I could walk with her.

04:52.624 --> 04:54.167
Wow, I don't know.

04:54.431 --> 04:56.082
Walk home from school?

04:56.284 --> 04:57.675
People still do that?

04:57.900 --> 05:00.771
You can't do that!
I need you in the car with me.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.238
I'm in the sixth grade.

05:02.721 --> 05:04.099
I'm not a baby.

05:04.519 --> 05:08.571
I'm old enough to stay home at 2:00 in the morning,
while you guys had your emergency.

05:08.622 --> 05:09.775
What emergency?

05:09.863 --> 05:12.352
I want to walk home from school. I do.

05:15.139 --> 05:17.931
She wants to walk home from school with her friend.

05:18.289 --> 05:20.099
Do you know what I do all day?

05:20.807 --> 05:22.457
Do you know what goes through my mind all day?

05:22.508 --> 05:24.581
What comes across my desk all day?

05:24.632 --> 05:26.596
Of course I do, but she's 12.

05:27.144 --> 05:28.797
This is non-negotiable. No!

05:28.965 --> 05:31.533
All right, you think so?
Let me tell you how this goes:

05:31.584 --> 05:33.374
You say it's non-negotiable, and then, one day,

05:33.425 --> 05:36.076
you're going to drive to school to pick her up and she's not going to be there.

05:36.127 --> 05:40.065
Because that's the way kids negotiate when they're told something is non-negotiable.

05:40.116 --> 05:41.179
What is the big deal?

05:41.230 --> 05:42.903
Why does she have to walk home?

05:42.954 --> 05:45.394
What is she going to do walking home from school with her friend,

05:45.445 --> 05:47.065
that she can't do in the car with me?

05:47.116 --> 05:49.065
Use bad language, talk about boys,

05:49.116 --> 05:51.674
complain about her teachers, complain about us...

05:54.323 --> 05:56.251
Allison, look,
she's a good girl.

05:56.547 --> 05:58.471
All right? We live in a nice part of town.

05:58.522 --> 06:00.374
I don't think we have a choice.

06:08.785 --> 06:09.497
Bye, Mommy!

06:10.098 --> 06:11.079
Bye, lamb chop.

06:11.773 --> 06:12.513
W hoa...

06:14.009 --> 06:14.996
One more time.

06:16.453 --> 06:18.033
Do you ever walk home alone?

06:18.084 --> 06:19.492
I never walk home alone.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.278
And what if Hannah's staying late?

06:21.329 --> 06:23.746
I come out here and I ride home with you.

06:24.268 --> 06:25.632
Okay, and if Hannah's sick?

06:25.683 --> 06:27.829
I come out here and I ride home with you.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.874
And if you and Hannah have a fight?

06:29.925 --> 06:32.166
I come out here and I ride home with you.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.366
What's the number of the police?

06:33.417 --> 06:34.378
911.

06:34.429 --> 06:35.115
What's our phone number?

06:35.166 --> 06:36.501
Mom, I'm 12!

06:37.290 --> 06:38.182
Okay, fine.

06:38.233 --> 06:40.555
- Do you have your key?
- I have my key.

06:41.954 --> 06:43.430
Now give me a hug.

06:47.969 --> 06:49.000
Mom?

06:49.215 --> 06:50.939
People can see.

06:51.894 --> 06:52.839
Okay.

07:00.146 --> 07:01.532
Okay, 4:00!

07:02.425 --> 07:03.833
Or earlier, if you want.

07:08.685 --> 07:10.881
I want to know where my little boy is.

07:11.202 --> 07:14.701
I assure you, Mrs. Church, Ms. Ballou,

07:14.750 --> 07:16.664
we're doing all we can to get to the bottom of this.

07:16.713 --> 07:18.429
Have you interviewed my ex-husband?

07:18.474 --> 07:20.786
Not personally, no, but I believe you know Mr. Calley.

07:20.837 --> 07:22.415
He's head of security operations.

07:22.466 --> 07:23.790
Security operations?!

07:24.550 --> 07:26.399
I always thought that he was in charge of making sure

07:26.450 --> 07:29.274
the women arriving didn't run into the women leaving.

07:29.325 --> 07:30.179
Ms. Ballou...

07:30.553 --> 07:32.271
Do you even know where he is?

07:33.944 --> 07:34.832
Of course not.

07:36.700 --> 07:37.618
He's gone.

07:38.471 --> 07:39.817
They're both gone.

07:39.908 --> 07:43.611
He took Justin to some safe haven island that he owns in the Caribbean,

07:43.662 --> 07:45.816
and I'm never going to see him again.

07:46.120 --> 07:46.916
Ms. Ballou...

07:47.138 --> 07:48.548
your ex-husband, Greydon Church,

07:48.599 --> 07:51.617
is one of the four or five richest men in the country.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.693
I, for one, find it hard to believe he's going to turn his back on that.

07:54.744 --> 07:56.120
Oh, he's not turning his back on anything.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.183
He's just simply moving it offshore.

07:58.863 --> 08:02.443
I don't think that you understand the depth of his hatred for me.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.773
When you can have anything that you want,

08:04.824 --> 08:07.054
when you can buy anything that you want,

08:07.482 --> 08:10.818
and one thing slips away, refuses to be bought?

08:11.610 --> 08:13.546
Well, what's the point of having all the money in the world,

08:13.597 --> 08:16.028
if you can't use it to exact revenge?

08:16.198 --> 08:18.376
I'm sorry there's acrimony between you and your ex,

08:18.427 --> 08:20.874
but his extraordinary wealth does not make him immune

08:20.925 --> 08:23.392
with regards to the custody laws of this state.

08:23.443 --> 08:25.798
If he's kept your son beyond his allowed visitation,

08:25.849 --> 08:27.579
or transported him out of state,

08:27.630 --> 08:30.929
he will be found, he will be caught, and he will be punished.

08:30.980 --> 08:31.796
Really.

08:33.254 --> 08:36.514
And his good friends, the mayor and the governor, will allow that to happen?

08:36.565 --> 08:39.373
The mayor values his friends, but not above the law.

08:39.424 --> 08:41.008
Ms. Ballou, let's be frank:

08:41.227 --> 08:43.933
Your divorce from Mr. Church hardly left you a pauper.

08:43.985 --> 08:45.812
And, clearly, you have your own friends in high places,

08:45.863 --> 08:48.043
otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting here.

08:48.097 --> 08:50.875
Technically, your son's gone missing for barely 12 hours

08:50.926 --> 08:54.531
and it's entirely possible there's a plausible explanation for where he is.

08:54.582 --> 08:55.935
Let us do our work:

08:56.029 --> 08:58.366
Begin our investigation and get back to you.

08:58.417 --> 09:01.392
Did I mention that one of my good friends from college

09:01.443 --> 09:04.185
is a producer for one of the network newsmagazines?

09:04.643 --> 09:06.913
You have 48 hours, Mr. District Attorney,

09:06.964 --> 09:09.655
or she is prepared to run with a story about how the State of Arizona

09:09.706 --> 09:11.643
and the City of Phoenix are providing cover

09:11.694 --> 09:14.320
for a billionaire who has kidnapped his own son.

09:22.833 --> 09:23.681
Mr. Calley...

09:24.386 --> 09:26.205
I need some answers and I need them quickly.

09:26.256 --> 09:28.570
Do  you know where little Justin Church is?

09:31.599 --> 09:34.157
Well, can you at least tell me where Greydon Church is?

09:34.208 --> 09:38.422
Well, first and foremost, let me assure you that everything and everyone are fine.

09:38.473 --> 09:39.990
Oh, you know that?

09:40.262 --> 09:42.660
Yes, I do know that,
Mr. District Attorney.

09:43.151 --> 09:47.335
Prior to working for Mr. Church, I served Her Majesty for 11 years with MI-6.

09:47.693 --> 09:48.984
I know a good many things.

09:49.035 --> 09:53.883
You work for the police department, and you are with the Mayor's Office.

09:54.756 --> 09:56.423
And  you are...

09:56.474 --> 09:59.208
Allison Dubois, with the District Attorney's Office.

10:04.876 --> 10:07.524
It's 7:00 p.m.
and the Big Dog is not here.

10:09.715 --> 10:12.817
Big Do g is not anywhere,and the Range Rover is missing.

10:16.745 --> 10:20.840
Mr. District Attorney, we know that the child spent the weekend with his father.

10:20.891 --> 10:24.442
We know that, at approximately 1900 hours yesterday, they left the premises.

10:24.493 --> 10:25.992
Do we know where they are? No.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.076
Do we know what time they'll be returning...?

10:28.127 --> 10:29.674
Am I worried? No.

10:30.285 --> 10:34.251
The fact is, Mr. Church often slips away unaccompanied

10:34.302 --> 10:36.602
to do things that men of great wealth like to do anonymously,

10:36.653 --> 10:37.834
and without an entourage.

10:37.885 --> 10:39.695
He's with a four-year-old boy.

10:40.129 --> 10:42.569
Well, perhaps he took him camping or fishing.

10:43.126 --> 10:44.590
Do you have a way of getting in touch with him?

10:44.641 --> 10:45.633
Does he phone in?

10:45.684 --> 10:47.587
Oh, I'm sure I'll be hearing from him soon enough.

10:47.638 --> 10:48.509
Well, just so we're clear,

10:48.560 --> 10:51.398
if I don't have answers by 3:00 p.m., I'm putting out a warrant.

10:51.449 --> 10:53.025
Then answers you shall have.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.746
Fat cat politicalcontributors and their domestic disputes...

11:00.402 --> 11:02.280
10:30, we've accomplished nothing.

11:02.782 --> 11:06.157
Mark my words: By 1:00, Junior will be home, Mommy will be drunk,

11:06.208 --> 11:07.676
and Daddy will have made another million.

11:07.727 --> 11:09.068
I'm not so sure.

11:09.119 --> 11:10.183
What do you mean?

11:10.715 --> 11:11.462
I just...

11:13.400 --> 11:14.983
When I shook his hand just now,

11:15.034 --> 11:18.858
I saw the moment that he realized
that Church was missing. He seemed...

11:19.332 --> 11:20.740
I don't know, concerned.

11:20.926 --> 11:24.464
He didn't seem casual or nonchalant the way he was a moment ago.

11:25.450 --> 11:27.821
He seemed... I don't know...

11:27.890 --> 11:28.654
he was anxious.

11:28.705 --> 11:29.978
And that proves...?

11:30.187 --> 11:31.605
Nothing. I don't know.

11:31.769 --> 11:34.133
I just thought it was curious, that's all.

11:34.484 --> 11:37.055
Sorry. I didn't mean to snap.

11:40.713 --> 11:43.379
Pardon me for saying so, but you look like hell.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.446
Oh, no, I'm fine.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.412
I just... I didn't get any sleep last night.

11:47.463 --> 11:50.630
Okay, well, go on, get out of here.
I'll give you a call.

11:50.681 --> 11:53.496
Trust me, what you just witnessed: a non-event.

12:00.152 --> 12:00.946
Hi, Mommy.

12:01.192 --> 12:03.081
Hi, lambchop. Buckle up.

12:05.217 --> 12:06.697
That's everybody, I guess.

12:06.748 --> 12:07.861
So, how was your day, pumpkin?

12:07.912 --> 12:10.016
It was pretty good.
We played a lot.

12:10.192 --> 12:10.978
Uh-huh.

12:11.473 --> 12:13.057
So how was your day, Mommy?

12:16.360 --> 12:18.768
It was pretty good... I guess.

12:31.066 --> 12:32.351
- Root beer?
- Yeah.

12:33.327 --> 12:34.301
Thanks.

12:53.153 --> 12:55.067
I think he's a high school boy.

12:56.092 --> 12:57.374
Am I cutting in line?

13:01.916 --> 13:03.481
Can I get two instant picks?

13:03.532 --> 13:04.328
Four dollars.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.075
11, 16...

13:07.582 --> 13:09.333
23,  87...

13:09.384 --> 13:10.150
He's so cute.

13:10.201 --> 13:10.889
Eleven.

13:13.437 --> 13:14.429
Nothing.

13:15.374 --> 13:17.356
Okay, let's try again.

13:18.536 --> 13:22.029
44... 15...

13:22.317 --> 13:24.391
22, 23...

13:24.442 --> 13:25.325
19.

13:27.078 --> 13:27.907
Sorry.

13:30.335 --> 13:31.182
77.

13:33.006 --> 13:33.734
Nothing.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.546
Should've went with 19.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.454
- You spoke to him.
- I know!

13:53.413 --> 13:55.334
After this, you want to read Nan?

13:56.938 --> 13:57.931
Maybe.

14:02.544 --> 14:03.734
Okay, where are you?

14:04.047 --> 14:05.899
I'm in my office. Is that okay?

14:06.456 --> 14:08.854
Sorry, sir, I thought you were someone else.

14:09.215 --> 14:10.589
So I'm not in trouble?

14:10.873 --> 14:12.173
No, of course not.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.840
Well, I just wanted to let you know that

14:13.891 --> 14:17.000
I've yet to hear anything more from Mr. Calley or Mr. Church,

14:17.051 --> 14:21.395
and I'm starting to grow genuinely concerned about the welfare of this little boy.

14:21.802 --> 14:25.787
I don't think I have a choice but to issue a warrant and put out an Amber alert.

14:25.838 --> 14:26.953
Anything I can do?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.266
Not right now. Just...

14:29.810 --> 14:32.610
get some rest and check in with me in the morning.

14:33.547 --> 14:34.321
Okay.

14:39.543 --> 14:40.723
Huh, look at that.

14:42.239 --> 14:43.281
Pizza.

14:45.356 --> 14:46.298
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:46.349 --> 14:48.310
- What's the damage?
- $22.11.

14:50.668 --> 14:52.252
Hey, Al, do you have any change?!

14:52.303 --> 14:53.367
Look in my purse!

14:56.724 --> 14:58.098
Hey, I'll be right in.

15:00.986 --> 15:03.124
Everything okay?
Didn't I have change?

15:04.470 --> 15:05.911
Yeah, you had change.

15:07.306 --> 15:08.328
What's going on?

15:14.478 --> 15:15.450
Oh, my God!

15:16.361 --> 15:18.247
Where'd all this money come from?

15:18.332 --> 15:22.650
According to this, you went to our bank today at 1:57, you closed down two CDs,

15:22.956 --> 15:25.772
our IRA and part of our Christmas club, and in return,

15:25.823 --> 15:29.116
they gave you $15,000 in cash.

15:29.167 --> 15:30.330
That's crazy!

15:30.670 --> 15:31.816
Isn't that your signature?

15:31.867 --> 15:33.985
I swear, I haven't been to the bank in two weeks.

15:34.036 --> 15:37.400
Well, you were there today, and you obviously authorized this withdrawal.

15:37.451 --> 15:38.113
No!

15:38.924 --> 15:41.360
I dropped the girls off at school, I went to work,

15:41.411 --> 15:43.243
I went to pick up Marie and Bridgette. No.

15:43.294 --> 15:44.579
Where did you go for lunch?

15:44.630 --> 15:45.500
I didn't go to lunch.

15:45.551 --> 15:47.633
Devalos sent me home early.
He said I looked tired.

15:47.684 --> 15:48.751
He said I looked like hell.

15:48.802 --> 15:49.690
When was that?

15:49.933 --> 15:51.261
10:30 or...

15:52.180 --> 15:53.194
Wait, wait, wait.

15:53.718 --> 15:54.348
I don't get it.

15:54.399 --> 15:59.458
What did you do between 10:30 in the morning and picking up the girls from school?

16:02.418 --> 16:03.577
I don't know.

16:08.452 --> 16:10.417
I-I think maybe I was asleep.

16:28.178 --> 16:30.760
I think we need to talk about the driving now.

16:31.003 --> 16:32.056
Excuse me?

16:32.319 --> 16:33.069
Driving.

16:33.371 --> 16:36.977
Apparently you drove all over town today while you were fast asleep.

16:37.176 --> 16:39.138
I think that merits some discussion.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.358
Well, what would you like me to say?

16:41.409 --> 16:43.983
How about, "Holy crap, Joe. I could have died."

16:45.198 --> 16:46.816
Our children could have died.

16:48.473 --> 16:50.110
You could have killed a lot of other innocent people.

16:50.161 --> 16:52.083
We could start there, you could work your way up to "I'm sorry."

16:52.134 --> 16:53.317
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

16:53.368 --> 16:57.666
I thought I was supposed to play the role of victim in this evening's performance.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.519
I'm glad you find this amusing.

17:02.481 --> 17:04.325
Did you take one of those pills?

17:04.679 --> 17:05.738
Not yet.

17:06.854 --> 17:08.002
What are you doing?

17:08.308 --> 17:10.023
I don't know, making sure this thing is locked.

17:10.075 --> 17:13.353
Trying  to figure out a way to keep you and us safe tonight.

17:14.318 --> 17:17.913
You know, I'm pretty sure if I can figure out how to drive a car while I'm asleep,

17:17.964 --> 17:21.112
I'm sure I can figure out how to unlock a door or open a window.

17:21.163 --> 17:22.262
Okay, fine.

17:23.314 --> 17:24.503
What do you suggest?

17:25.496 --> 17:27.172
Should I tie you to the bed?

17:27.733 --> 17:28.966
That sounds like fun.

17:29.651 --> 17:30.873
Well, it's not!

17:31.434 --> 17:32.824
None of this is fun!

17:33.459 --> 17:34.753
Now take your pill!

17:38.540 --> 17:39.457
Fine.

17:41.051 --> 17:42.589
I'll take my pill.

17:43.091 --> 17:44.007
Thank you.

18:00.571 --> 18:01.479
Wait a second.

18:03.008 --> 18:04.432
Where...? What happened to the money?

18:04.483 --> 18:05.203
I have it.

18:06.788 --> 18:08.632
It's somewhere safe.
I have it.

18:09.163 --> 18:11.470
I'll take it to the bank in the morning.

18:11.521 --> 18:13.927
I don't understand.
Why would you do that?

18:15.534 --> 18:18.241
What is it that you're worried that I would do with it?

18:18.292 --> 18:19.188
I don't know.

18:19.544 --> 18:21.170
I've never been here before.

18:21.677 --> 18:22.711
Have you?

18:28.334 --> 18:33.086
You took... you took my keys, didn't you?
You took my house keys and my car keys?

18:34.005 --> 18:34.769
Come on.

18:35.664 --> 18:37.122
Let's get ready for bed.

19:05.288 --> 19:06.135
Al?

19:07.805 --> 19:08.911
Did you hear that?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.006
Al?

19:19.471 --> 19:20.111
Daddy?

19:20.535 --> 19:22.169
It's okay.
Go back to bed.

19:25.554 --> 19:26.702
Where's the money?!

19:27.098 --> 19:28.203
Where's the money?!

19:28.254 --> 19:29.813
I need the money!

19:30.202 --> 19:31.266
I need the money!

19:39.832 --> 19:40.934
We got money.

19:42.166 --> 19:44.438
- I need that money!
- Of course you do.

19:45.832 --> 19:47.122
I'll take you to it.

19:50.685 --> 19:52.556
Come on. Come on.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.034
Go to bed.

19:59.876 --> 20:00.660
Bed!

20:03.973 --> 20:05.171
It's right in here.

20:11.570 --> 20:12.944
Where? Where's the money?

20:12.995 --> 20:14.235
It's right in there.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.363
Where's the money?

20:17.544 --> 20:18.692
Where's the money?!

20:23.918 --> 20:24.651
Morning.

20:25.399 --> 20:26.463
Where is she now?

20:26.980 --> 20:29.248
In bed, awake, thank God.

20:29.748 --> 20:31.048
Well, that won't last.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.479
She's going to fall back asleep eventually,

20:32.530 --> 20:35.706
and when she does, we want to make sure she's really out.

20:35.757 --> 20:38.107
You know where those pills are that I gave her?

20:38.158 --> 20:39.618
Yeah, she took one before she went to bed.

20:39.669 --> 20:42.125
Well, see if you can get her to take three.

20:43.373 --> 20:44.281
Excuse me?

20:44.541 --> 20:45.678
You need some sleep.

20:45.729 --> 20:46.675
Give her three.

20:46.951 --> 20:49.189
That'll put her out for about 18 hours.

20:49.358 --> 20:50.577
Is that safe?

20:50.874 --> 20:54.425
It's absolutely safe, and trust me, she won't be going anywhere on that dosage.

20:54.476 --> 20:56.915
It'll give you and your family some time to recover.

20:56.966 --> 20:58.884
Okay. Thank you.

20:59.152 --> 21:00.542
But what about afterwards?

21:00.593 --> 21:02.119
I can't just keep drugging her.

21:02.170 --> 21:03.367
I'm not suggesting that.

21:03.418 --> 21:06.156
What you need to do is observe her, listen to her,

21:06.207 --> 21:09.520
figure out what the unresolved anxiety is that's causing her to sleepwalk.

21:09.571 --> 21:11.736
If you can address the root of the anxiety,

21:11.787 --> 21:14.353
you can very likely end the disruptive behavior.

21:21.841 --> 21:24.004
Is Mommy picking us up today?

21:24.155 --> 21:25.831
Uh, I don't think so, honey.

21:26.021 --> 21:28.806
Um, everyone look for my car when they come out of school, all right?

21:28.857 --> 21:29.764
Not me, Daddy.

21:29.815 --> 21:32.826
I'm walking home from school with Hannah, remember?

21:33.030 --> 21:34.236
Right, Hannah.

21:34.551 --> 21:35.268
Got it.

21:35.319 --> 21:36.458
All right, kisses.

21:37.423 --> 21:38.243
Kisses.

21:42.880 --> 21:43.943
I'm sorry to bother you.

21:43.994 --> 21:45.536
Um, my name is Joe Dubois.

21:45.983 --> 21:51.182
My wife came in here yesterday and mistakenly withdrew $15,000.

21:52.443 --> 21:53.459
Thank you.

21:55.755 --> 21:57.641
I know this sounds kind of crazy,

21:58.444 --> 22:01.764
but I was wondering if there was any way I could just, uh...

22:01.846 --> 22:03.071
give it back.

22:04.465 --> 22:07.926
Uh, it's been barely 18 hours.

22:09.131 --> 22:12.131
Well, I don't know what to tell you, Mr. Dubois.

22:12.412 --> 22:14.614
Uh, we're a bank, not a department store.

22:14.665 --> 22:16.832
We really don't have a return policy.

22:17.061 --> 22:17.842
I know, but...

22:17.893 --> 22:20.265
No, no, no. We can, we can work with you,

22:20.417 --> 22:23.975
but those CDs were cashed in early,
and there are penalties for that.

22:24.026 --> 22:26.303
So, the balances won't be the same.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.193
You know, when she came in here,

22:30.244 --> 22:32.804
I sensed there was something strange about it all.

22:32.855 --> 22:34.765
The teller brought over her withdrawal slip,

22:34.816 --> 22:37.627
and until we convinced her to move the decimal points,

22:37.678 --> 22:39.740
she had it made out for $15 million.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.645
You know, I read somewhere that the governor calls this his idiot tax.

22:45.696 --> 22:46.476
Shut up.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.726
43... 76...

22:51.763 --> 22:55.020
nine, 22...

22:55.287 --> 22:56.245
Try 16.

22:56.988 --> 22:57.691
What?

22:58.305 --> 22:59.060
I'm lucky.

22:59.208 --> 23:01.235
I have just always been lucky.

23:01.286 --> 23:02.354
Try 16.

23:05.944 --> 23:06.718
29.

23:08.927 --> 23:10.951
Guess we know why they call it the idiot tax.

23:11.002 --> 23:11.995
Try again?

23:12.432 --> 23:13.404
53... 99...

23:16.352 --> 23:19.206
61, six...

23:19.399 --> 23:20.047
Five.

23:25.149 --> 23:26.568
Hell, five.

23:28.705 --> 23:29.675
Got one right.

23:30.479 --> 23:32.181
In fifth position, number five.

23:32.673 --> 23:34.165
You just won five dollars.

23:43.113 --> 23:43.844
Excellent.

23:44.329 --> 23:46.255
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

23:47.028 --> 23:48.134
See you tomorrow.

23:51.062 --> 23:51.797
You are...

23:51.895 --> 23:54.605
You are the luckiest person I have ever met.

24:11.540 --> 24:12.630
What time is it?

24:13.464 --> 24:15.274
Don't you mean what day is it?

24:16.001 --> 24:18.356
Oh, my God.
How long have I been asleep?

24:19.607 --> 24:21.016
About 16 hours.

24:22.356 --> 24:24.037
It's night.
Oh, my God.

24:24.690 --> 24:26.266
What about the kids?
Where are the kids?

24:26.317 --> 24:27.233
Are the kids in bed?

24:27.284 --> 24:28.384
I'm hoping so.

24:28.660 --> 24:31.759
Ariel's at Hannah's, Bridgette and Marie are at Alan and Kamala's.

24:31.810 --> 24:32.741
What? Why?

24:32.808 --> 24:35.643
It's a, it's a weeknight.
The girls have school in the morning.

24:35.694 --> 24:39.652
All the more reason *** someplace where they can get a good night's sleep.

24:41.719 --> 24:42.930
Oh, Joe.

24:43.594 --> 24:44.608
It's okay.

24:45.553 --> 24:49.162
What about work?
Did anyone call from work? This is terrible.

24:49.242 --> 24:51.273
Devalos, a few hours ago.

24:51.977 --> 24:54.198
He wanted me to tell you that Calley called.

24:54.249 --> 24:57.543
Apparently Greydon Church ran off with $15 million

24:57.818 --> 25:01.711
in cash and bearer bonds the day he and his son disappeared.

25:02.682 --> 25:05.592
Does that number hold any special significance for you?

25:05.821 --> 25:07.082
$15 million?

25:07.238 --> 25:07.903
Mm-hmm.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.065
No.

25:09.887 --> 25:11.064
Why? Should it?

25:11.565 --> 25:15.809
Apparently you tried to withdraw that same amount from our bank account yesterday.

25:21.163 --> 25:22.486
I don't remember.

25:22.846 --> 25:24.480
I had a hunch you wouldn't.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.572
I am so sorry about all of this.

25:30.425 --> 25:32.193
You look exhausted.

25:34.722 --> 25:35.912
You need some sleep.

25:36.051 --> 25:38.096
Maybe you should get me another one of those pills.

25:38.147 --> 25:39.549
No, no more pills.

25:40.659 --> 25:44.402
Actually, I thought tonight we'd try something different.

25:58.998 --> 25:59.969
Hey, Al.

26:00.566 --> 26:01.309
Al, you awake?

26:01.360 --> 26:02.260
Shh!

26:02.383 --> 26:04.566
Not now! I gotta get to Route 96.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.679
Route 96?
What's on Route 96?

26:11.460 --> 26:12.551
My car keys!

26:13.572 --> 26:15.122
I can't find my car keys!

26:15.885 --> 26:17.441
I hid them, remember?

26:19.311 --> 26:20.811
You want me to drive you?

26:21.845 --> 26:24.527
This is as far as I know to go.
You can stop.

26:25.287 --> 26:26.206
Stop!

26:37.488 --> 26:39.310
I think that's close enough.

26:39.793 --> 26:41.517
I have to get down there!

26:41.568 --> 26:42.412
What's down there?

26:42.463 --> 26:44.376
I have to get down there!

26:44.770 --> 26:47.252
No, I think now would be an excellent time to wake up!

26:47.303 --> 26:49.129
I have to get down there.

26:49.180 --> 26:51.222
Allison, hey, hey! Wake up!

26:52.298 --> 26:53.290
Oh, boy.

26:53.636 --> 26:54.471
Sorry!

26:57.486 --> 26:59.028
Just know that I love you.

27:01.283 --> 27:02.422
Allison!

27:04.433 --> 27:05.891
There's a car down here!

27:10.339 --> 27:11.294
Oh, boy.

27:11.845 --> 27:14.122
License plate says "Church 1"!

27:14.618 --> 27:15.779
Greydon Church.

27:20.645 --> 27:21.552
Oh, boy.

27:23.101 --> 27:24.693
If this is him, he's dead!

27:26.105 --> 27:27.912
Is there a little boy with him?

27:28.248 --> 27:29.100
Hold on!

27:44.177 --> 27:44.909
No!

27:45.156 --> 27:46.408
I don't see anyone!

28:04.407 --> 28:08.274
I think I may have found that $15 million you've been looking for.

28:17.438 --> 28:20.658
Whatever you can't move to this afternoon, move to tomorrow.

28:21.785 --> 28:24.773
Tell the rest of the guys I-I'll be in, um, after lunch.

28:24.824 --> 28:27.272
Yeah. We're at the pediatrician's right now.

28:29.529 --> 28:30.423
Okay, thanks.

28:31.078 --> 28:32.388
Lonely place to die.

28:33.557 --> 28:36.002
That car could have sat there for months if you didn't find it.

28:36.053 --> 28:38.262
What was he doing out here?
Do you think his ex was right?

28:38.313 --> 28:39.506
Do you think he was trying to run off?

28:39.557 --> 28:41.493
If he was, he was doing it alone.

28:41.947 --> 28:44.112
We've combed through a hundred yards of desert in each direction,

28:44.163 --> 28:47.854
and there's nothing to suggest that a second body was thrown clear of Church's car.

28:47.905 --> 28:50.553
Is there anyway that his son could have walked away?

28:50.604 --> 28:53.739
The passenger door was pinned against the side of the embankment.

28:53.790 --> 28:55.322
No tracks, no blood trail.

28:55.373 --> 28:56.379
Detective Scanlon?

28:56.437 --> 28:58.541
This was found in Church's CD player.

29:03.931 --> 29:05.720
Did you enjoy your cigarette, Mr. Church?

29:05.771 --> 29:06.546
I hope so.

29:06.663 --> 29:10.603
You have 45 minutes to respond to this message, and your time starts now.

29:10.654 --> 29:12.600
If you ever care to see your son again,

29:12.651 --> 29:16.449
gather that $15 million you keep lying around in cash and bearer bonds,

29:16.500 --> 29:17.946
and drive out on the 10.

29:17.997 --> 29:20.418
Exit onto Rural Route 96.

29:20.469 --> 29:22.974
There's a gas station just north of Saxonburg.

29:23.025 --> 29:24.933
Park and wait for further instruction.

29:24.984 --> 29:26.657
Do not alert your staff.

29:26.708 --> 29:28.575
Do not alert the authorities.

29:28.626 --> 29:30.810
You have 45 minutes to appear.

29:31.012 --> 29:32.906
If you do not appear in 45 minutes

29:32.957 --> 29:35.746
I will sever one finger from your son's left hand.

29:35.797 --> 29:39.057
Every ten minutes you keep me waiting, I will remove another finger.

29:39.108 --> 29:41.885
When I run out of fingers, I will start on his toes.

29:41.936 --> 29:44.014
You have already lost one minute.

29:48.825 --> 29:51.449
That has to be someone who worked for me, or...

29:51.640 --> 29:52.702
works for me.

29:54.049 --> 29:54.863
He knows too much.

29:54.914 --> 29:56.817
The smoking, the apocalypse money...

29:56.868 --> 29:57.919
Apocalypse money?

29:59.434 --> 30:01.116
He always kept it around, kept it close,

30:01.167 --> 30:04.605
big duffel full of cash and bonds, for when the apocalypse came.

30:05.039 --> 30:06.419
Or terrorists...

30:07.348 --> 30:08.982
I used to kid him about it.

30:09.622 --> 30:11.072
What's the smoking thing?

30:11.613 --> 30:16.172
He quit for seven months when Justin was born, but he fell off the wagon.

30:17.270 --> 30:19.849
He was bound and determined that his son never know,

30:19.900 --> 30:22.304
never see him do it, so he used to sneak out.

30:22.355 --> 30:24.803
"Just give me four minutes," he used to say.

30:26.066 --> 30:27.726
"Just four minutes." So, uh...

30:32.582 --> 30:34.172
whoever it was, knew...

30:36.798 --> 30:41.374
knew that he had four minutes in and out, to take the boy...

30:47.755 --> 30:49.001
...leave the disc.

30:52.058 --> 30:54.227
All right, we got a little boy to find.

30:54.278 --> 30:55.456
You know what you need to do.

30:55.507 --> 30:56.294
Pray?

30:57.135 --> 30:58.677
That CD is three days old.

30:58.773 --> 30:59.768
Nonetheless.

31:02.056 --> 31:03.514
And you and your husbandshould head home.

31:03.565 --> 31:05.477
Get some sleep, you've done what you can here.

31:05.528 --> 31:06.461
You sure?

31:06.792 --> 31:08.299
Have you looked at yourself?

31:08.350 --> 31:09.418
You're exhausted.

31:09.982 --> 31:12.725
Besides, you're the only person I can honestly say is more effective

31:12.776 --> 31:14.736
when they're asleep than when they're awake.

31:14.787 --> 31:17.435
It's 7:00 p.m., and the Big Dog is not here.

31:18.445 --> 31:21.631
The Big Dog is not anywhere and the Range Rover's missing.

31:24.756 --> 31:25.730
Nice to have you back.

31:25.781 --> 31:26.665
Sleep well?

31:27.212 --> 31:28.108
I don't know.

31:28.643 --> 31:30.311
I keep seeing the same thing.

31:30.537 --> 31:33.246
When I'm awake, when I dream. It's Calley.

31:33.360 --> 31:36.806
It's that, it's the moment he discovers that Church is missing.

31:37.006 --> 31:39.772
I, I just can't figure out why I keep seeing it.

31:45.060 --> 31:46.208
Great, you're here.

31:46.382 --> 31:47.283
Just one sec.

31:59.383 --> 32:00.187
Is this her?

32:00.271 --> 32:01.033
That's her.

32:01.223 --> 32:03.033
Oh, my God.
She's just a kid.

32:03.209 --> 32:04.933
Yeah, but watch this.

32:05.686 --> 32:07.474
Give me one $20 instant pick.

32:07.827 --> 32:08.984
$20, huh?

32:09.127 --> 32:10.411
Gonna be a mega-idiot.

32:10.462 --> 32:11.252
Shut up.

32:12.286 --> 32:14.214
All right, what's my first number?

32:18.096 --> 32:19.026
This is stupid.

32:19.211 --> 32:21.010
Let's just buy some beer.
Forget this.

32:21.061 --> 32:24.179
I know he's over 21,
but I need to see your ID, miss.

32:30.616 --> 32:34.230
- What's the matter with you? Give me a number.
- Leave her alone.

32:39.947 --> 32:40.615
11.

32:40.924 --> 32:42.726
All right,
she's doing it. 11.

32:45.621 --> 32:46.559
23.

32:48.202 --> 32:49.075
14.

32:50.396 --> 32:51.302
38.

32:52.040 --> 32:52.828
32.

32:53.523 --> 32:54.411
All right. 11,

32:54.930 --> 32:58.580
23, 14, 38, 32.

33:01.341 --> 33:02.741
The governor says thanks.

33:02.958 --> 33:04.416
Why? How much did I win?

33:04.865 --> 33:06.893
You won me and a six-pack of beer.

33:08.034 --> 33:09.210
Let's go.

33:09.710 --> 33:10.598
Wait a minute.

33:11.233 --> 33:13.343
You just lost me 20 bucks, twerp.

33:16.140 --> 33:17.808
What are you blaming her for?

33:17.882 --> 33:19.340
She's just a little kid.

33:19.524 --> 33:21.754
You're the idiot that plays the lottery.

33:29.386 --> 33:31.096
Did Ariel say anything to you?

33:34.703 --> 33:35.846
No. Why?

33:36.587 --> 33:37.264
I don't know.

33:37.315 --> 33:39.495
She just seemed awfully quiet at dinner.

33:41.190 --> 33:42.329
It's starting.

33:42.752 --> 33:43.724
What's starting?

33:48.197 --> 33:50.007
She's living her own life.

33:50.198 --> 33:50.873
She's...

33:52.664 --> 33:54.339
making her own memories.

33:54.390 --> 33:55.931
Keeping her own secrets.

33:56.741 --> 33:58.822
She's walking home from school.

33:59.084 --> 34:02.346
She's not backpacking across Europe with some guy named Sven.

34:02.466 --> 34:04.249
You joke. I miss her.

34:04.300 --> 34:05.985
She's right next door.

34:26.958 --> 34:27.730
Hang on one second.

34:27.781 --> 34:29.745
Someone's at the door. Hey.

34:48.413 --> 34:49.656
Uncle Calley?

34:52.469 --> 34:55.596
Allison. Allison. Allison!

34:57.671 --> 34:58.614
Mommy?

34:58.871 --> 35:00.337
What were you doing?

35:02.658 --> 35:03.592
It's okay.

35:04.177 --> 35:05.280
I'm awake now.

35:11.492 --> 35:13.089
It's Devalos. He has news.

35:13.307 --> 35:14.894
Calley shot the kidnapper.

35:14.945 --> 35:16.223
Justin's safe.

35:16.660 --> 35:18.210
I know. I was there.

35:19.884 --> 35:21.082
I'll get the pills.

35:23.311 --> 35:25.909
It's 7:00 p.m., ananthe Big Dog is not here.

35:27.007 --> 35:30.059
Big Dog is not anywhere, and the Range Rover is missing.

35:38.777 --> 35:40.347
Oh, my God.

35:40.667 --> 35:41.846
Not again.

35:41.897 --> 35:43.301
No, no. Shh!
It's okay.

35:43.352 --> 35:44.597
I'm awake, I swear.

35:44.783 --> 35:45.847
Go back to sleep.

35:47.685 --> 35:51.291
I couldn't figure out why it kept showing me the same moment over and over again, and then...

35:51.342 --> 35:53.480
Wait. Who kept showing you what moment?

35:53.556 --> 35:58.165
Church. He kept showing me the moment when Calley discovered that he and the boy were gone.

35:58.216 --> 36:00.262
Except Calley never mentioned the boy.

36:01.123 --> 36:01.992
I'm sorry?

36:02.297 --> 36:05.619
It's always "The Big Dog" is gone. The Big Dog. Church.

36:05.712 --> 36:07.398
Not the Big Dog and his son.

36:08.093 --> 36:10.843
It's because Calley already knew the son was gone.

36:11.121 --> 36:15.265
Because Calley and the man he was talking to had already snatched him.

36:29.562 --> 36:33.247
I think I speak for everyone when I offer my heartfelt thanks

36:33.298 --> 36:37.106
for your extraordinarily brave rescue of Justin Church early this morning.

36:37.434 --> 36:39.416
Obviously, since a homicide was involved,

36:39.467 --> 36:41.753
there are some facts we'll need to sort through.

36:41.804 --> 36:45.382
And, since you've waived your right to have an attorney present,

36:45.433 --> 36:48.653
I promise to make this as quick and as painless as possible.

36:48.704 --> 36:52.178
Can you tell us something about your relationship with the apparent kidnapper--

36:52.229 --> 36:54.392
Mr. Tracy Oppen?

36:55.037 --> 36:58.126
Yes. Mr. Church asked me to let him go last January.

36:58.177 --> 36:58.994
Bad attitude.

36:59.421 --> 37:00.543
They had had words.

37:00.594 --> 37:03.985
And I understand he was still carrying copies of keys to the house?

37:04.036 --> 37:06.300
I turned everything over to the detective.

37:06.352 --> 37:08.043
So you went through your records--

37:08.094 --> 37:09.953
everyone who had worked for Mr. Church--

37:10.004 --> 37:13.001
and there was just something about Mr. Oppen?

37:14.587 --> 37:17.245
It was an instinct more than anything, I suppose.

37:17.803 --> 37:21.001
I remembered hearing that he lived in the desert,

37:21.052 --> 37:24.532
and then we were in the desert yesterday morning with Mr. Church.

37:25.288 --> 37:26.830
I decided to go out there.

37:27.946 --> 37:31.886
Must have heard my truck coming because he was standing outside when I pulled in.

37:31.937 --> 37:32.863
Outside?

37:33.624 --> 37:34.224
Hang on one second.

37:34.258 --> 37:35.297
Someone's at the door.

37:35.348 --> 37:35.948
Really?

37:38.079 --> 37:41.432
The minute he saw me, he turned and ran back inside.

37:42.904 --> 37:45.628
I just knew in my bones he was going for a gun,

37:46.228 --> 37:48.927
so, once he was down, I went inside to look for Justin.

37:48.978 --> 37:51.274
I wasn't sure what I'd find, but he was right there.

37:51.325 --> 37:52.298
Nothing missing.

37:53.091 --> 37:56.672
I picked him up and I took him to hospital as fast as I could.

37:58.647 --> 37:59.963
Simple as that, really.

38:01.337 --> 38:04.613
You're very fond of Justin, aren't you?

38:04.818 --> 38:05.682
Of course.

38:05.918 --> 38:09.540
And I know you would never do anything to cause him any real harm.

38:09.951 --> 38:11.765
And I know you were very fond of his father.

38:11.816 --> 38:13.702
In fact, you were devoted to him.

38:14.587 --> 38:18.125
You had no way of knowing that his car would go over that cliff.

38:20.058 --> 38:21.382
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

38:21.526 --> 38:22.419
I haven't slept.

38:22.470 --> 38:25.354
Uh... I'm not sure I understand where this is going.

38:25.767 --> 38:27.947
We were just wondering about the phones.

38:28.912 --> 38:29.847
The phones?

38:30.892 --> 38:34.648
We have a witness who says Oppen was on the phone when you shot him.

38:36.150 --> 38:37.284
Well, that's absurd.

38:37.335 --> 38:38.039
I saw no phone.

38:38.090 --> 38:39.488
There certainly were no witnesses.

38:39.539 --> 38:44.143
This witness also says you stopped on the way to the hospital and threw something away.

38:45.528 --> 38:48.063
Again, there were no witnesses, there were no phones.

38:48.114 --> 38:52.814
Mr. Calley, this witness led us to the place where he says you deposited this trash.

38:52.975 --> 38:54.201
This is ridiculous.

38:55.508 --> 38:57.302
Inside, two disposable cell phones--

38:57.353 --> 38:59.583
the kind you get at a convenience store.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.776
Cheap, hard to trace.

39:02.443 --> 39:05.184
One of them has Mr. Oppen's fingerprints all over it.

39:05.235 --> 39:07.381
You were on the other, talking to him.

39:08.009 --> 39:08.777
Hang on one second.

39:08.828 --> 39:10.152
Someone's at the door.

39:11.741 --> 39:14.701
You were talking to him because he was your accomplice.

39:14.902 --> 39:16.773
The two of you had a plan, and it would have worked,

39:16.824 --> 39:20.353
if only Mr. Church hadn't been in such a hurry and gone off that road.

39:20.404 --> 39:24.205
And if only our witness hadn't heard Mr. Oppen on the telephone,

39:24.858 --> 39:27.172
and then seen you throw those phones away.

39:28.948 --> 39:30.148
This is absurd.

39:30.661 --> 39:31.694
I had no accomplice.

39:31.745 --> 39:36.906
I don't know anything about any phones, and I can assure you there is no witness.

39:37.045 --> 39:37.867
Really?

39:38.406 --> 39:40.626
Are you calling Justin Church a liar?

39:46.907 --> 39:48.034
Hey, hey, hey!

39:48.421 --> 39:49.560
Easy! Whoa!

39:50.631 --> 39:51.695
Take it easy.

39:52.699 --> 39:55.060
Mr. Calley, you're under arrest

39:55.110 --> 39:58.674
for the kidnapping  of Justin Church and the murder of Tracy Oppen.

39:59.488 --> 40:01.576
Detective Scanlon, read him his rights.

40:10.038 --> 40:10.872
Hi.

40:13.383 --> 40:14.404
Well, hi.

40:16.695 --> 40:17.598
Hannah sick?

40:19.360 --> 40:20.684
You guys have a fight?

40:23.965 --> 40:25.209
What's the deal?

40:26.113 --> 40:27.009
I don't know.

40:27.107 --> 40:29.297
I just don't want to walk home anymore.

40:29.348 --> 40:31.066
I want to ride home with you.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.376
I want it back the way it was.

40:34.112 --> 40:36.170
Wow. Me, too.

40:36.581 --> 40:37.369
Good.

40:38.571 --> 40:40.685
If only life worked that way.

40:41.768 --> 40:42.832
What do you mean?

40:43.905 --> 40:45.447
You can ride home with me.

40:45.919 --> 40:47.805
You can always ride home with me.

40:48.897 --> 40:51.563
But you can't undo whatever it is that happened.

40:52.577 --> 40:54.486
What makes you think something happened?

40:54.537 --> 40:56.956
Well, something must have happened to make you not want to walk home

40:57.007 --> 40:59.744
when it was so important to you a few days ago.

41:02.141 --> 41:03.625
Was it something dangerous?

41:06.013 --> 41:07.329
Was it something scary?

41:08.931 --> 41:10.281
Just something upsetting.

41:12.602 --> 41:13.229
Yeah.

41:13.645 --> 41:15.555
Life is full of those.

41:17.523 --> 41:18.891
All right, then.
Here's what we can do.

41:18.942 --> 41:20.224
I can drive you home.

41:20.662 --> 41:23.990
I can drive you home for the rest of your life if you want.

41:26.493 --> 41:28.463
Of course, you might lose a friend.

41:29.296 --> 41:33.641
And you might miss out on one or two really wonderful experiences.

41:35.764 --> 41:39.266
Or you can walk home with Hannah-- your friend.

41:39.826 --> 41:44.227
And when you get home, you can tell me-- your mother--

41:44.278 --> 41:46.955
exactly what happened to make you feel that way.

41:49.636 --> 41:53.201
'Cause, honey, even if I don't drive you home,

41:54.727 --> 41:57.193
I will always be waiting there for you.

42:12.727 --> 42:13.822
See you at 4:00.

42:15.027 --> 42:16.131
Maybe even earlier.

42:19.897 --> 42:22.817
Oh, no!
She's not coming back again, is she?

42:23.237 --> 42:25.315
Oh, shh! Don't be silly.

42:25.513 --> 42:26.839
She never really left.

42:29.605 --> 42:32.622
