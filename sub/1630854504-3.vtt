Question nine.

01:27.880 --> 01:31.953
How many bones are there
in a shark's body?

01:31.953 --> 01:34.473
- It's a trick question.
- I've seen a shark skeleton.

01:34.473 --> 01:36.337
It's all cartilage.
There's no bones.

01:36.337 --> 01:37.925
It looked like bones.

01:39.168 --> 01:40.479
Alright.

01:42.723 --> 01:45.174
Last question.

01:45.174 --> 01:50.006
How many referees rule
an official fencing match?

01:50.006 --> 01:51.732
- I repeat...
- No way.

01:51.732 --> 01:56.357
...how many referees rule
an official fencing match?

01:56.357 --> 01:58.532
Two assisting referees,
one main.

01:59.705 --> 02:01.500
- You're kidding me.
- He fences.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.882
I am actually a fencer.

02:03.882 --> 02:05.642
Well, level two.

02:05.642 --> 02:08.611
I also referee at domestic cadet
and junior competitions.

02:09.508 --> 02:10.992
Isn't life full of surprises?

02:10.992 --> 02:12.994
And there we have it, folks.

02:12.994 --> 02:14.548
Round complete.

02:14.548 --> 02:16.032
Get yourself a drink,

02:16.032 --> 02:18.379
- and we'll be back in five.
- Very impressive.

02:19.725 --> 02:20.933
- Well done.
- I'll get another round in,

02:20.933 --> 02:22.556
shall I?
Same again?

02:22.556 --> 02:23.902
- Thank you.
- Do you want a hand, mate?

02:23.902 --> 02:25.352
Um, I'm alright.

02:27.008 --> 02:28.596
Just nipping to the ladies.

02:28.596 --> 02:29.597
Okay.

02:29.597 --> 02:31.530
Can I get another round, please?

02:36.294 --> 02:39.400
Can I get, um, yeah,
a whiskey, as well, yeah?

02:39.400 --> 02:40.574
Double.

02:58.419 --> 02:59.420
Fibber!

02:59.420 --> 03:01.042
Honestly, she's really nice.

03:01.042 --> 03:02.596
Oh, "honestly," my ass.

03:02.596 --> 03:04.011
Every time you tell a fib,

03:04.011 --> 03:06.393
you blink like it's
going out of fashion.

03:06.393 --> 03:07.877
Charlie's just the same.

03:07.877 --> 03:09.016
Jenna's a mate of Brodie's.

03:09.016 --> 03:10.224
Nothing happened, okay?

03:10.224 --> 03:12.295
Watch this.
Charlie?

03:12.295 --> 03:13.676
Yeah?

03:13.676 --> 03:15.264
Are you and Ruby
getting on alright?

03:16.403 --> 03:18.232
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.854
We're fine.
We're fine.

03:19.854 --> 03:21.580
You see?

03:21.580 --> 03:23.617
We both know it's like the
War of the Roses between them,

03:23.617 --> 03:27.241
so for the last time,
you do not like Kat.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.622
Well, she's good for Mike.

03:28.622 --> 03:30.693
- Oh, bollocks.
- Oh, Mum, just drop it.

03:30.693 --> 03:32.246
Okay, me and Mike, it's over.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.420
We're all just moving on.

03:33.420 --> 03:35.007
- Uh-oh.
- What now?

03:35.007 --> 03:36.008
Molly Stratton.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.838
She's alright.

03:37.838 --> 03:40.081
She's not.
She's public enemy number one.

03:40.081 --> 03:42.325
She's decided
to sell her mum's pub

03:42.325 --> 03:43.671
and put it on the open market.

03:43.671 --> 03:46.018
So we'll be crawling
with developers.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.434
I thought the town
were buying it back?

03:47.434 --> 03:48.642
Well, so did the town.

03:48.642 --> 03:50.609
- Pearl!
- Yeah.

03:50.609 --> 03:51.817
Can I have a word?

03:51.817 --> 03:52.853
Sure.

03:52.853 --> 03:54.820
In my office?

03:59.860 --> 04:01.724
The notes started
a few weeks ago.

04:01.724 --> 04:04.278
It's all a bit childish, really.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.728
Sometimes left on the doorstep.

04:05.728 --> 04:07.488
Sometimes through the letterbox.

04:07.488 --> 04:10.284
I don't think I can help you
with this, sorry.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.703
This coffee's a bit...

04:15.703 --> 04:17.912
- What?
- Cold. Sorry.

04:17.912 --> 04:20.950
This isn't gonna work.

04:20.950 --> 04:22.779
Okay, hang on.

04:22.779 --> 04:24.540
Look.
I'm sorry.

04:26.542 --> 04:29.441
The notes are just starting
to get a bit more...

04:29.441 --> 04:30.649
threatening.

04:32.064 --> 04:36.862
Then, last night, a dead seagull
was left on the doorstep.

04:36.862 --> 04:38.864
Well, maybe a fox left it there.

04:38.864 --> 04:39.900
No.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.523
A note was attached.

04:44.111 --> 04:45.526
Who do you think's doing it?

04:47.148 --> 04:50.013
There are a few people
who are a bit upset.

04:52.153 --> 04:55.778
The Save The Dolphin Pub
action group, mainly.

04:55.778 --> 04:56.744
Who's that?

04:56.744 --> 04:58.332
The Doodys.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.852
They own the bookshop.

05:00.852 --> 05:02.750
They started
this bloody committee.

05:04.545 --> 05:07.583
They came to see Mum
towards the end,

05:07.583 --> 05:11.414
and we all agreed we'd sell
the pub back to the town.

05:11.414 --> 05:12.795
Well, what changed, then?

05:13.727 --> 05:15.384
Well, since Mum died,

05:15.384 --> 05:17.075
the property market's
gone mad, hasn't it?

05:17.075 --> 05:18.801
Ah.

05:18.801 --> 05:21.148
I need to open it up.

05:21.148 --> 05:23.012
Put the pub on the open market.

05:23.012 --> 05:25.152
Well, what about the promise
that you made?

05:27.430 --> 05:29.363
No, Mum would understand.

05:32.401 --> 05:34.161
This is my future.

05:37.751 --> 05:39.649
I can...

05:39.649 --> 05:42.583
finally move on.

05:50.039 --> 05:51.661
There are more notes.

05:58.427 --> 06:00.498
And you haven't been
to the police about this?

06:00.498 --> 06:03.017
No. It's just some local
with a bee in their bonnet.

06:03.017 --> 06:04.467
Well, it's a big bee.

06:06.745 --> 06:10.956
There's, um,
an open day today...

06:10.956 --> 06:12.682
at the pub.

06:12.682 --> 06:15.444
The estate agent's bringing in
all the prospective buyers

06:15.444 --> 06:18.308
for best and final offers.

06:20.172 --> 06:25.626
I suppose whoever is doing this
might be there.

06:27.559 --> 06:29.216
Okay.

06:29.216 --> 06:32.184
I'll come, keep an eye out.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.497
Let's find out who
your new best friend is.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.778
- What did she want?
- She hired me.

06:39.778 --> 06:42.436
What?
Molly Stratton is radioactive.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.920
She's being threatened.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.784
Yes, that's because
she's letting down her mum.

06:45.784 --> 06:48.097
Look, I hate to say this,
but it is <i>her</i> pub,

06:48.097 --> 06:50.306
despite what the town think.

06:50.306 --> 06:53.033
Look, I don't want that place to
go to grubby developers, either,

06:53.033 --> 06:54.517
but she's being threatened.

06:54.517 --> 06:56.208
And it's not right.

07:03.492 --> 07:05.321
Save The Dolphin!

07:09.118 --> 07:10.878
Hi, Molly.

07:10.878 --> 07:12.880
Oh, hi, Pearl.

07:12.880 --> 07:16.470
Yep, that's them, the Doodys,
the leaders of the action group.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.955
Alright, okay, I've got to go.

07:18.955 --> 07:20.681
Oh, sorry I'm late.

07:20.681 --> 07:23.097
Couldn't find anywhere to park,
and then my Dad rang me.

07:23.097 --> 07:25.617
Lauren, this is Pearl.

07:25.617 --> 07:28.309
- Pearl's here for--
- Moral support, really.

07:28.309 --> 07:30.553
- Oh, lovely to meet you.
- And you.

07:30.553 --> 07:32.659
Well, I think we'll have offers
by the end of the day.

07:32.659 --> 07:34.730
Just depends on how far
you wanna push everyone.

07:34.730 --> 07:36.939
- As far as we can.
- Not too far, please!

07:36.939 --> 07:39.562
I've got to see some profit.
Elliot Lloyd.

07:39.562 --> 07:41.322
We buy an old boot, break it up,

07:41.322 --> 07:43.083
turn it into lots
of little glass slippers.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.153
Oh, very nice.

07:44.153 --> 07:46.155
Elliot, we spoke on the phone.

07:46.155 --> 07:47.639
I'm Lauren Foster,

07:47.639 --> 07:49.399
the new manager
at Foster's Estate Agent.

07:49.399 --> 07:51.850
Oh, yeah, I heard
old flash Alan's retired.

07:51.850 --> 07:54.197
Polishing his golf clubs, is he?
Hope he's trained you up.

07:54.197 --> 07:55.578
He has.
Have no fear.

07:55.578 --> 07:58.270
Oh, and, uh, this is Molly,
the vendor.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.928
- It's great to have you here.
- Hey, I'm your man.

08:00.928 --> 08:02.792
This is gonna be
a landmark development.

08:02.792 --> 08:05.588
Not just stunning apartments,
with gym,

08:05.588 --> 08:07.176
owner's lounge, work pods.

08:07.176 --> 08:11.698
Oh, Christ. Still they continue
to come like ants.

08:11.698 --> 08:13.700
These DFLs.

08:13.700 --> 08:16.737
Wiping away every last crumb
of Old Whitstable.

08:16.737 --> 08:19.637
You know, you've stolen the town
from beneath our feet.

08:19.637 --> 08:21.984
- He doesn't care, Tony.
- Look, don't panic yet.

08:21.984 --> 08:24.642
I've still gotta get
planning onside.

08:24.642 --> 08:26.782
I mean, it's nothing
that a bottle of champagne

08:26.782 --> 08:29.923
and a few solar panels on the
plans doesn't sort out, so...

08:29.923 --> 08:31.580
We could do the deal now,
if you like.

08:31.580 --> 08:33.133
It's all about money, isn't it?

08:33.133 --> 08:36.136
I mean, shall I lie and say,
"No, it's not"?

08:36.136 --> 08:37.689
Molly, let me pick your brains.

08:37.689 --> 08:40.002
So, 'cause you know the place...

08:40.002 --> 08:42.142
The community could still
raise their offer, Mrs. Doody.

08:42.142 --> 08:43.453
Yeah.

08:45.352 --> 08:47.250
Hello, Freya.

08:48.597 --> 08:51.323
- What you doing here, Pearl?
- I'm here with Molly.

08:52.601 --> 08:54.223
Lucky you.

08:54.223 --> 08:57.778
She's been getting some
anonymous threatening notes.

08:57.778 --> 08:59.573
Don't know anything
about that, do you?

09:01.851 --> 09:04.578
I haven't written
any threatening letters

09:04.578 --> 09:05.614
to Molly, no.

09:06.615 --> 09:08.202
She hasn't been
to the police yet.

09:08.202 --> 09:09.997
But, I mean, technically,
it is harassment.

09:09.997 --> 09:11.412
Can't help, sorry.

09:11.412 --> 09:13.138
We don't know what
you're talking about.

09:13.138 --> 09:15.347
I tell you what,
I wish I'd have thought of it.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.763
Will you excuse us?

09:18.419 --> 09:20.145
See you later.

09:29.223 --> 09:31.674
Hello, Winnie.
Thought you'd be here.

09:31.674 --> 09:33.434
Hello, Pearl.

09:42.305 --> 09:44.031
Do you want me to get you
a cup of tea?

09:45.619 --> 09:47.828
I'd prefer a sherry
from the bar.

09:53.454 --> 09:55.180
Those Doodys are a bit full-on,
aren't they?

09:56.630 --> 09:59.184
They're trying, though.

09:59.184 --> 10:01.462
I wanted to show my support.

10:01.462 --> 10:03.810
Yeah, 'course.

10:05.018 --> 10:08.228
They'd do anything
to save this pub.

10:10.471 --> 10:12.508
I'll make sure you get
that sherry.

10:13.129 --> 10:15.269
Excuse me a minute.

10:20.067 --> 10:22.691
Got your best
and final offer in?

10:22.691 --> 10:25.659
Yeah. I'm not too sure
I'll have that much luck.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.867
Well, you never know.

10:26.867 --> 10:28.006
I'm Pearl, by the way.

10:29.007 --> 10:29.905
Sammy.

10:30.940 --> 10:32.355
So all offers are now in!

10:32.355 --> 10:33.667
What are they?

10:35.220 --> 10:37.878
I better get this.

10:38.534 --> 10:39.708
Good luck.

10:41.054 --> 10:42.089
Hold on.

10:48.889 --> 10:49.890
Mr. Lloyd.

10:53.342 --> 10:54.930
The pub is yours.

10:54.930 --> 10:56.897
The right choice, Miss Molly,
the right choice.

10:56.897 --> 10:58.761
Can I have those, uh, bubbles
I ordered, please?

10:58.761 --> 11:00.832
Thank you, my darling.

11:00.832 --> 11:02.938
This wouldn't have happened
without you.

11:02.938 --> 11:04.767
How about you, Grandma?
Do you want some bubbles?

11:04.767 --> 11:07.183
- Whoo!
- Oh, there, I woke her up.

11:07.183 --> 11:08.840
Cheers!

11:08.840 --> 11:10.946
Tony, darling, grab a glass.

11:10.946 --> 11:12.326
This won't drink itself.

11:12.326 --> 11:14.156
The Dolphin is mine, sir.

11:15.744 --> 11:17.815
- Cheers. Here's to the future.
- Cheers.

11:17.815 --> 11:20.541
Tell you what, smartass,
this isn't the last of it.

11:49.225 --> 11:51.538
Fisherman found him
this morning.

11:51.538 --> 11:53.574
Do we know who it is?

11:53.574 --> 11:54.990
That developer.

11:55.991 --> 11:57.371
There's no sign of foul play.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.241
Yeah.
Just give me a sec.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.660
I was wondering
when you'd turn up.

12:11.903 --> 12:15.596
One SOCO tent, a few coppers,
and there she is.

12:15.596 --> 12:17.944
- What do you want?
- What happened?

12:17.944 --> 12:19.186
Don't know yet.

12:19.186 --> 12:21.775
- Murder?
- Not ruling it out.

12:21.775 --> 12:22.845
Elliot Lloyd?

12:22.845 --> 12:24.813
Can't answer that, Pearl.

12:24.813 --> 12:27.574
I met him yesterday.
He's a right piece of work.

12:27.574 --> 12:29.231
He was buying The Dolphin.

12:30.508 --> 12:31.820
No?

12:31.820 --> 12:34.132
It's a pub.
He was the highest bidder.

12:34.132 --> 12:36.134
There was a few of 'em after it.

12:36.134 --> 12:37.204
What are the injuries?

12:38.654 --> 12:40.414
That's all you're getting.
Now I've got a crime scene

12:40.414 --> 12:41.553
washing itself away
by the minute.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.934
I've gotta go.

12:42.934 --> 12:44.073
- Alright, Pearl.
- Alright, Nikki.

12:44.073 --> 12:45.557
What are the injuries?

12:45.557 --> 12:47.076
Head wound, broken leg,
probably more.

12:47.076 --> 12:48.388
- Nikki!
- What?

12:48.388 --> 12:51.046
Sorry, my fault.

12:51.046 --> 12:52.944
Guv, they're ready
to bring in the deceased now.

12:52.944 --> 12:54.981
- Right.
- No sign of his phone.

12:54.981 --> 12:56.810
- But his wallet was intact.
- Right.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.467
Forensics reckon
he's not been dead long.

12:58.467 --> 13:01.125
A few hours, maybe.

13:01.125 --> 13:04.680
Weird, when I was with him
yesterday, he was half cut.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.268
You really should be going now.

13:06.268 --> 13:08.442
I think you need me around.

13:08.442 --> 13:09.478
And why's that?

13:09.478 --> 13:10.824
Because if this is a murder,

13:10.824 --> 13:12.688
I know who all
your suspects are.

13:25.321 --> 13:27.013
Same writing on all?

13:27.013 --> 13:29.015
Yeah, looks like it.

13:31.086 --> 13:33.882
Right, we need to check these
for prints and DNA.

13:33.882 --> 13:35.366
This has got to be
to do with that pub, Mike.

13:35.366 --> 13:36.643
It has to be.

13:36.643 --> 13:38.058
There's people in this town

13:38.058 --> 13:40.336
that really care about
that place passionately.

13:40.336 --> 13:42.131
And they'll do anything
to preserve it.

13:42.131 --> 13:43.374
Who's "they"?

13:43.374 --> 13:44.858
The Doodys.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.964
They run a local bookshop.

13:46.964 --> 13:49.345
Molly's mum promised their
community group the pub, right?

13:49.345 --> 13:51.071
And then Molly changed her mind.
They went mad.

13:51.071 --> 13:54.316
They set up a Save The Dolphin
campaign group.

13:54.316 --> 13:56.283
Then there's Sammy Grady.
He's a chef.

13:56.283 --> 13:58.078
He was having a massive row
with someone on the phone

13:58.078 --> 13:59.908
outside at the open day.

13:59.908 --> 14:02.911
And they were all outbid
by our friend Elliot Lloyd.

14:02.911 --> 14:06.535
So my first stop would be
the Doodys and then Sammy Grady.

14:06.535 --> 14:09.089
Oh, and there's a dead seagull
in a bin bag in my shed.

14:09.089 --> 14:10.332
All to do with
this note business.

14:12.921 --> 14:15.509
Alright, well, I'll get this lot
over to the lab and, uh...

14:15.509 --> 14:17.304
I'll take it from there.
Cheers, Pearl.

14:17.304 --> 14:18.754
Have you thought
about the tide times yet?

14:19.962 --> 14:21.895
The street, the strip
where you found him,

14:21.895 --> 14:23.966
it's got a unique
current formation.

14:23.966 --> 14:25.312
It's got two shorelines.

14:25.312 --> 14:26.935
It's 'cause of
conflicting currents.

14:26.935 --> 14:28.281
It means that you can
be pretty specific

14:28.281 --> 14:29.972
about when and how he got there.

14:29.972 --> 14:31.905
And how do you know that someone
didn't carry him down there?

14:31.905 --> 14:33.458
It's half a mile long.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.046
I mean, it'd be easier
to kill someone on the beach

14:35.046 --> 14:37.255
and let the tide
do the hard work.

14:37.255 --> 14:38.912
So have you got
last night's tide times?

14:40.155 --> 14:41.604
We're getting them now.

14:41.604 --> 14:43.330
This is a murder
investigation, Mike.

14:43.330 --> 14:45.988
Chop-chop. I'll meet you at
the Doodys' in an hour, yeah?

14:50.372 --> 14:52.201
You're a bloody pain in the ass.

15:02.763 --> 15:04.627
That girl's got blood
on her hands.

15:05.974 --> 15:07.768
None of this would have happened
if she hadn't been so set

15:07.768 --> 15:09.494
on selling the pub to that worm.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.672
Thing is, that worm is dead now.

15:14.672 --> 15:18.020
Yeah, good riddance.

15:19.746 --> 15:21.196
You seem very angry, Mrs. Doody.

15:21.196 --> 15:23.853
Not angry, just sad.

15:27.512 --> 15:29.756
And I know what you're doing, Detective.

15:29.756 --> 15:31.206
I didn't kill him.

15:31.206 --> 15:33.035
And what about these letters
that were sent?

15:33.035 --> 15:35.141
I've already told her,
we didn't write any letters.

15:35.141 --> 15:36.314
What were you doing last night?

15:39.593 --> 15:41.664
We had a book group. Here.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.979
We've been reading "It"
by Stephen King.

15:45.979 --> 15:46.773
Oh.

15:48.602 --> 15:50.570
It's quite the frightener.
it is, too.

15:53.642 --> 15:57.232
The entire group can verify
that I was here.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.787
And after that?

16:04.618 --> 16:07.276
We did a stock-take
into the night.

16:07.276 --> 16:12.661
Um, I've no idea what time
I went to bed, but it was--

16:12.661 --> 16:14.594
it was jolly late.

16:14.594 --> 16:16.768
You got CCTV cameras here
after hours?

16:18.391 --> 16:21.739
No, they're-- they're
not working at the moment.

16:21.739 --> 16:23.672
Yeah, 'course they're not.

16:23.672 --> 16:25.674
Very thorough.

16:25.674 --> 16:28.056
Writing reviews
of all the recent releases.

16:28.056 --> 16:30.472
Oh, that was Tony's idea.

16:30.472 --> 16:33.475
We divvy them up.
Half each.

16:38.687 --> 16:39.757
Excuse me.

16:39.757 --> 16:40.861
Hm.

16:42.242 --> 16:44.279
Hello, there.
How can I help?

16:49.077 --> 16:50.802
You can't do that.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.494
<i>You</i> can't.
I can.

16:57.602 --> 16:59.397
- Hey, Guv?
- Yeah.

16:59.397 --> 17:01.848
Elliot Lloyd was out
celebrating till late.

17:01.848 --> 17:04.126
Apparently the owners
at The Hotel Continental

17:04.126 --> 17:05.748
had to ask him to leave the bar.

17:05.748 --> 17:09.925
At 1:05 a.m., we've got him
on CCTV stumbling out.

17:09.925 --> 17:12.617
Heads in the direction of
Tankerton, where he was staying,

17:12.617 --> 17:14.102
but then we lose him.

17:14.102 --> 17:16.069
Well, we're missing something.
Keep looking.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.071
I've gotta go.
I've got a meeting.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.521
I'll, uh, catch you later.

17:19.521 --> 17:21.730
Sure.

17:33.121 --> 17:34.294
Elliot Lloyd's been murdered.

17:36.158 --> 17:37.435
Murdered?

17:37.435 --> 17:39.265
Had you ever met him
before yesterday?

17:39.265 --> 17:41.750
Um, no.

17:43.510 --> 17:44.615
Sorry, one sec.

17:44.615 --> 17:45.926
Hi, Dad.

17:47.238 --> 17:48.653
Yeah, no,
I can't talk right now.

17:48.653 --> 17:50.759
I'm with someone.

17:50.759 --> 17:53.727
Yes, yes,
I-I put the board outside.

17:55.315 --> 17:57.524
Yeah, okay.

17:57.524 --> 17:59.112
Alright, I've got to go.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.770
Okay.
Bye, bye.

18:03.289 --> 18:05.153
- Sorry.
- Oh. Dads.

18:05.153 --> 18:07.258
Yeah.
It's exhausting.

18:08.915 --> 18:10.123
So, Elliot Lloyd.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.987
Oh, yeah, um...

18:11.987 --> 18:13.471
Based in London.

18:13.471 --> 18:15.680
Uh, buys properties
in tourist towns.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.718
Um, he's got a bit
of a reputation, certainly.

18:18.718 --> 18:20.961
Mm.

18:20.961 --> 18:22.411
And who was
the next highest bidder?

18:22.411 --> 18:24.413
Uh, Sammy Grady.

18:24.413 --> 18:26.484
Do you know where I can
get ahold of him?

18:26.484 --> 18:28.141
Uh, I think I've just got
a family address

18:28.141 --> 18:29.625
for him in Lincolnshire,

18:29.625 --> 18:31.765
but I do know he's staying
in Whitstable somewhere.

18:31.765 --> 18:32.801
Mm.

18:35.390 --> 18:36.839
I've got a mobile number
for him.

18:36.839 --> 18:38.324
I mean, strictly speaking,

18:38.324 --> 18:40.705
I shouldn't be giving it
to you, but...

18:43.915 --> 18:45.434
Have you heard
about Elliot Lloyd?

18:45.434 --> 18:47.160
Yeah, Pearl just told me.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.058
So, what happens now?

18:49.058 --> 18:51.578
Well, there'll be a postmortem
and an investigation.

18:51.578 --> 18:53.856
No, I mean about my pub.

18:53.856 --> 18:56.411
- The sale.
- Wow, Molly.

18:56.411 --> 18:58.861
You're a motivated seller,
I'll give you that.

18:58.861 --> 19:00.208
You've got plenty of options.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.899
- Other buyers are waiting.
- Pearl?

19:01.899 --> 19:06.248
Kat, hi!
Hey, what are you doing here?

19:06.248 --> 19:09.389
Uh, we are finally
getting our own place.

19:09.389 --> 19:10.597
- Can't wait, can we?
- Yeah.

19:10.597 --> 19:12.875
Wow, that's exciting.

19:15.326 --> 19:17.466
Bye, then.

19:27.062 --> 19:28.615
<i>Hi. This is Sammy Grady.</i>

19:28.615 --> 19:30.962
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

19:30.962 --> 19:33.275
Hi, Sammy.
This is Pearl Nolan.

19:33.275 --> 19:35.967
I'm working on behalf
of Molly Stratton.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.659
Do you think you could
give me a call back?

19:59.094 --> 20:02.062
Ooh.
Hello, sailor.

20:02.062 --> 20:04.306
I like it.
Where are you off to?

20:04.306 --> 20:07.620
I'm having a romantic night in
with the man of my dreams.

20:07.620 --> 20:09.311
We're getting a takeaway.

20:09.311 --> 20:11.693
Pearl?
I want to say something.

20:11.693 --> 20:14.109
Not now, please, Mum.
Tom makes me happy.

20:14.109 --> 20:15.835
Pearl. Pearl.

20:17.319 --> 20:19.114
I'm happy for you.

20:19.114 --> 20:20.426
Really.

20:21.427 --> 20:23.705
Right. Okay.

20:23.705 --> 20:25.879
And... that guy, the chef,

20:25.879 --> 20:27.536
the one who wanted
to buy The Dolphin.

20:27.536 --> 20:28.951
- What's he called? Sammy...
- Sammy Grady?

20:28.951 --> 20:31.989
That's right. Well, I've
found out where he works.

20:31.989 --> 20:34.060
The Neptune.

20:34.060 --> 20:35.268
Oh.

20:36.649 --> 20:38.823
- I love you.
- At last.

20:41.343 --> 20:43.000
- Hello?
- Tom, it's me.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.553
Um, change of plan.

20:44.553 --> 20:47.694
How about we meet at The Neptune
in about half an hour?

20:47.694 --> 20:49.317
Sure, see you there!

20:49.317 --> 20:52.837
Oh, now I've gone and ruined
your romantic night in.

20:52.837 --> 20:55.668
Well, sod that.
I've got work to do.

20:55.668 --> 20:56.669
Thank you.

21:02.502 --> 21:06.126
Um, you work really hard,
a bit too hard sometimes,

21:06.126 --> 21:08.128
and I just wanna share
the load, you know?

21:08.128 --> 21:10.061
So, how about we make a deal?

21:10.061 --> 21:12.995
I'll cook for you,
say, twice a week?

21:12.995 --> 21:14.307
Like Mondays and Wednesday.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.860
Not Wednesdays.
I've got hot yoga.

21:15.860 --> 21:17.966
But Mondays and Thursdays
or-- or something?

21:17.966 --> 21:20.348
I mean, I'm not saying I'm
the greatest cook in the world,

21:20.348 --> 21:22.591
but, you know, I could--
it's a gesture.

21:22.591 --> 21:23.454
Pearl?

21:25.732 --> 21:28.390
Yeah.
Same again?

21:29.391 --> 21:31.013
Sure.

21:33.222 --> 21:35.363
- Same again, please.
- Sure.

21:35.363 --> 21:37.710
That was delicious.
Thank Sammy for me.

21:37.710 --> 21:39.608
Oh, Sammy's not on tonight.
Called in sick.

21:39.608 --> 21:40.989
- Oh, no.
- I said to him,

21:40.989 --> 21:42.715
it's probably the breakfasts
at The Bramford.

21:42.715 --> 21:44.510
- Given him food poisoning.
- Is he staying at The Bramford?

21:44.510 --> 21:45.752
- Mm.
- Poor guy.

21:45.752 --> 21:47.582
I'd rather sleep
on an oyster bed.

21:53.173 --> 21:54.934
Always on call.

21:54.934 --> 21:56.832
It's alright.
I'm getting used to it now.

22:01.216 --> 22:02.700
Another chip.

22:12.952 --> 22:14.367
Ever seen a ghost?

22:14.367 --> 22:15.644
Bloody hell.

22:17.715 --> 22:19.752
Caretaker died in one
of the rooms last year.

22:19.752 --> 22:20.925
Yeah?

22:20.925 --> 22:22.410
You'd have to be pretty skint

22:22.410 --> 22:24.135
or pretty desperate
to have to stay there.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.654
I can believe that.

22:26.379 --> 22:27.863
How's the house hunting going?

22:27.863 --> 22:29.209
Not brilliant.

22:29.209 --> 22:31.453
Everything sells so bloody fast.

22:31.453 --> 22:33.213
Oh, that's all the Londoners
coming down,

22:33.213 --> 22:35.181
- buying everything up.
- Yes.

22:35.181 --> 22:36.458
Point taken.

22:42.602 --> 22:45.053
Hi, there.
I'm D.C. Mike McGuire.

22:45.053 --> 22:46.675
Can you tell me
if there's a Sammy Grady

22:46.675 --> 22:48.781
- staying here, please?
- Oh, is he in trouble?

22:48.781 --> 22:50.438
Nothing to worry about.
What room is he in?

22:50.438 --> 22:52.681
Uh, he's in room 510
on the first floor.

22:52.681 --> 22:53.889
Cheers.

22:58.031 --> 22:59.136
You look tired, Sammy.

22:59.136 --> 23:01.276
Uh, yeah.

23:01.276 --> 23:04.831
I'm, uh, doing double shifts
at the pub at the moment.

23:04.831 --> 23:06.074
100-hour weeks.

23:06.074 --> 23:08.594
It's just a--
just a bit intense.

23:09.664 --> 23:12.045
If you can buy a pub, surely
you can rent somewhere decent?

23:12.045 --> 23:13.702
Oh, it's all borrowed.

23:13.702 --> 23:16.636
I'm treading on very thin ice.

23:16.636 --> 23:18.051
You really needed that pub.

23:19.570 --> 23:22.021
Yeah.

23:22.021 --> 23:23.263
I didn't kill anyone.

23:25.542 --> 23:29.787
Oh, this-- Oh, this is my wife,
Bella, and our daughter.

23:29.787 --> 23:30.995
It's the police.

23:30.995 --> 23:32.065
They're just asking
a few questions.

23:32.065 --> 23:34.240
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:34.240 --> 23:38.106
Um, what did you do
after the open day?

23:38.106 --> 23:41.592
Uh, well, when I left
The Dolphin, I went--

23:41.592 --> 23:43.042
I went back to work.

23:43.042 --> 23:44.699
And I was there till what, midnight?

23:44.699 --> 23:47.598
Yeah, he was back by 12:30.

23:47.598 --> 23:49.151
I'm sorry to ask, but who was it

23:49.151 --> 23:50.808
you were you arguing with
on the phone outside?

23:56.158 --> 23:59.196
We, uh, couldn't agree
on how much to offer.

23:59.196 --> 24:01.094
He went in far too low.

24:01.094 --> 24:03.096
He's never bold enough.

24:03.096 --> 24:05.513
I'm sorry that you missed out.

24:05.513 --> 24:06.617
Whose are those?

24:06.617 --> 24:07.756
Hmm?

24:08.481 --> 24:09.758
Oh, they're just mine.

24:09.758 --> 24:12.312
Just bad back.
Lifting baby, you know?

24:13.900 --> 24:15.557
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Sorry.

24:15.557 --> 24:17.179
- We'll get off.
- No worries.

24:17.179 --> 24:18.940
Listen, I'm sorry
we couldn't be more help.

24:18.940 --> 24:20.493
No worries.
Thank you so much.

24:20.493 --> 24:21.943
Alright, cheers.
Thank you.

24:23.082 --> 24:24.255
See you.

24:32.850 --> 24:35.094
We need to check the CCTV.

24:35.094 --> 24:36.371
You don't believe Bella?

24:36.371 --> 24:38.200
Those pills are amitriptyline.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.755
You take 'em at night.
And they knock you out.

24:40.755 --> 24:43.136
If she was on those painkillers,
there's no way she'd know

24:43.136 --> 24:45.000
whether he was
in that room or not.

24:46.623 --> 24:49.177
Okay. That bit's true.
Home from work.

24:50.765 --> 24:53.526
Push it on a bit.

24:58.773 --> 24:59.912
Nothing.

24:59.912 --> 25:01.672
Oh.

25:03.122 --> 25:04.917
Well, well, well.

25:13.891 --> 25:15.721
I went for a walk.

25:15.721 --> 25:17.377
A walk?

25:17.377 --> 25:19.310
Well, yeah.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.692
Bella and I were arguing
'cause I'd lost the pub.

25:21.692 --> 25:23.452
I mean, you've seen
where we're living.

25:23.452 --> 25:26.179
The baby's crying all the time.
We're both really stressed.

25:26.179 --> 25:27.629
I'm working God knows what hours
under the sun

25:27.629 --> 25:28.906
to try and get out of there.

25:28.906 --> 25:30.632
So I went to get some fresh air.

25:30.632 --> 25:31.702
I went for a walk.

25:31.702 --> 25:33.773
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

25:36.431 --> 25:38.571
We're gonna need you
to stay in town, Mr. Grady.

25:38.571 --> 25:40.400
And if you think
of anything else

25:40.400 --> 25:42.333
that you might have forgotten
to tell us,

25:42.333 --> 25:44.577
don't hesitate to call, yeah?

25:45.336 --> 25:46.372
Yeah.

25:53.621 --> 25:56.209
I'm telling you,
Sammy Grady had time.

25:56.209 --> 25:57.659
It only takes 10 minutes

25:57.659 --> 25:59.005
to walk from The Bramford
to Tankerton beach.

25:59.005 --> 26:01.732
Elliot left the Continental
just after 1:00.

26:01.732 --> 26:03.631
Maybe Elliot and Sammy
just ran into each other,

26:03.631 --> 26:05.874
got into one about the pub,
and it kicked off.

26:05.874 --> 26:08.049
Maybe, but we still need to see

26:08.049 --> 26:10.085
where Sammy went
for his night walk.

26:10.085 --> 26:12.018
The landlord at the Continental
said Elliot Lloyd

26:12.018 --> 26:14.607
was texting a lot
while he was drinking.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.229
- Still no luck with his phone?
- No.

26:16.229 --> 26:17.472
Apparently it was
a burner phone,

26:17.472 --> 26:19.474
so no links
to his other devices.

26:19.474 --> 26:21.856
He was a bloody developer.
What do you expect?

26:21.856 --> 26:24.306
- Mm-hmm.
- What's that?

26:24.306 --> 26:26.481
I nicked some notes from Sammy
and Bella's room.

26:26.481 --> 26:28.172
You're unbelievable.

26:28.172 --> 26:30.002
Well, they don't match anyway.
So it was a waste of time.

26:30.002 --> 26:31.624
Hello?
Alright?

26:33.143 --> 26:34.247
Yeah.

26:35.110 --> 26:37.803
Yeah, go on.

26:37.803 --> 26:39.425
He's actually smiling.

26:39.425 --> 26:41.530
- He's laughing.
- Right.

26:42.773 --> 26:43.912
No, I'm just at work, yeah.

26:43.912 --> 26:45.120
It's weird.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.053
Huh?

26:47.053 --> 26:48.848
I've gotta go.
I've really got-- Yeah, yeah.

26:48.848 --> 26:51.782
Alright, alright.
Bye, bye, bye.

26:52.887 --> 26:55.027
Timecode-- 1:32.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.546
Here we go.

26:58.513 --> 27:00.135
There he is by the harbor.

27:04.415 --> 27:07.833
Then he's walking in
the direction of Tankerton.

27:07.833 --> 27:09.075
What?

27:09.075 --> 27:11.940
He goes straight back
to The Bramford.

27:11.940 --> 27:13.355
So he didn't head to Tankerton.

27:13.355 --> 27:14.909
Went straight back to his hotel.

27:16.117 --> 27:17.566
Brilliant.

27:17.566 --> 27:19.741
Well, that leaves us
with absolutely nothing.

27:23.020 --> 27:24.746
Look at that camera.

27:24.746 --> 27:26.506
That's The Dolphin.

27:29.302 --> 27:31.235
<i>Hi. This is Molly.</i>

27:31.235 --> 27:34.342
<i>Leave your name and number
and I'll get back to you.</i>

27:40.831 --> 27:42.868
- Pearl.
- You're working late.

27:42.868 --> 27:45.525
Yeah, it's quiet, no phones.

27:46.492 --> 27:49.840
Quick question.
Who's got keys to The Dolphin?

27:49.840 --> 27:52.981
- Uh, me and Molly, I think.
- Right.

27:52.981 --> 27:55.190
It's just I was watching
some security camera footage

27:55.190 --> 27:57.123
from the other night, and...

27:57.123 --> 27:59.885
well, a light went on just after
half 1:00 in the morning.

27:59.885 --> 28:01.265
That wasn't you, was it?

28:01.265 --> 28:02.888
You're joking, right?

28:02.888 --> 28:04.337
Sorry.
Just had to ask.

28:04.337 --> 28:05.925
Well, if at all possible,

28:05.925 --> 28:08.065
I try to sleep between
the hours of 12:00 and 5:00.

28:08.065 --> 28:09.998
'Course.

28:09.998 --> 28:12.483
Just I-I can't
get hold of Molly.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.623
I couldn't borrow your key,
could I?

28:14.623 --> 28:16.073
I just wanna check
everything's alright.

28:19.732 --> 28:20.940
Promise you'll return it?

28:20.940 --> 28:22.424
Yeah, 'course.

28:29.984 --> 28:31.364
Thanks, Lauren.

28:42.893 --> 28:43.998
Molly?

29:29.422 --> 29:31.183
This better be good.

29:33.047 --> 29:34.048
Pearl?

29:35.601 --> 29:36.636
Pearl?

29:53.584 --> 29:55.724
- Molly?
- Oh, Pearl?

30:00.212 --> 30:02.007
Why are you breaking
into your own pub, Molly?

30:02.007 --> 30:07.633
Oh, because it's the other thing
I've lost, my keys.

30:07.633 --> 30:09.048
No, wait, what do you mean
the other thing?

30:09.048 --> 30:10.325
What's the first thing?

30:10.325 --> 30:12.845
Oh, just the deeds
to this place.

30:12.845 --> 30:15.399
Solicitor hasn't got them.

30:15.399 --> 30:17.056
I haven't got them.

30:17.988 --> 30:19.265
I thought they might be here.

30:20.439 --> 30:21.854
So the keys have gone?

30:21.854 --> 30:23.925
Yeah, oh, yeah,
the keys have gone.

30:23.925 --> 30:26.238
I opened up on the open day.

30:26.238 --> 30:28.930
But when it came to lock up,
I couldn't find them.

30:28.930 --> 30:31.036
I mean, they must have
fallen out of my pocket.

30:31.036 --> 30:33.245
Yeah, or someone's
had 'em off you.

30:33.245 --> 30:34.487
Mm?

30:36.144 --> 30:38.250
No one's been here
since the open day?

30:38.250 --> 30:40.424
- No.
- Hmm.

30:41.425 --> 30:43.669
So who were the big
darts players?

30:43.669 --> 30:46.085
Uh, uh, the Doodys.

30:48.053 --> 30:49.123
Okay.

30:59.892 --> 31:01.756
You had me worried for a minute.

31:01.756 --> 31:04.414
I was fine. I was armed
with a massive umbrella.

31:05.104 --> 31:07.935
That's not actually a
recognized mode of self-defense.

31:07.935 --> 31:10.730
Oh, right. Sorry.
I left my lightsaber at home.

31:10.730 --> 31:12.077
Now you're talking.

31:13.941 --> 31:16.288
Well, Molly lost her key
to the pub on the open day.

31:16.288 --> 31:18.186
And she knows she had it
'cause she opened up.

31:21.258 --> 31:25.055
You need to start talking.
This is a murder investigation

31:25.055 --> 31:26.194
Yeah.

31:31.130 --> 31:34.962
Look, it wasn't--
it wasn't stealing, really.

31:34.962 --> 31:37.033
Not-- Not really.

31:37.723 --> 31:41.589
We, um-- We swore
everyone to secrecy.

31:41.589 --> 31:43.384
Who's everyone?

31:43.384 --> 31:48.630
Uh, here, the, um,
Save The Dolphin action group.

31:50.115 --> 31:53.187
You know, we just wanted
to give everyone the chance

31:53.187 --> 31:55.120
to go back to the pub.

31:55.120 --> 31:58.744
You know, just meet up,
play cards.

31:58.744 --> 32:01.402
Have a drink.

32:01.402 --> 32:02.817
One last time.

32:04.957 --> 32:07.373
We met at 1:30 a.m.

32:07.373 --> 32:08.650
About eight of us.

32:08.650 --> 32:12.137
Yeah, and it was wonderful.
It was.

32:12.137 --> 32:14.967
We took our own drinks in.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.556
And-- And put some music on. And...

32:17.556 --> 32:19.213
And Winnie, bless her,

32:19.213 --> 32:23.010
Winnie set her alarm
and brought her own sherry in.

32:23.010 --> 32:26.116
It was like the old days.

32:26.979 --> 32:29.223
- Did you play darts?
- Oh, yes.

32:30.396 --> 32:32.985
Who kept score?

32:32.985 --> 32:34.400
Uh...

32:37.438 --> 32:38.991
Winnie.

32:53.247 --> 32:55.490
Mike, hang on.
Wait, wait.

32:55.490 --> 32:57.216
Let me talk to her first.

32:59.736 --> 33:01.945
Record it.

33:01.945 --> 33:03.015
'Course.

33:09.435 --> 33:11.437
I had to do something.

33:13.301 --> 33:16.063
Leaving notes.
I don't know.

33:16.063 --> 33:18.237
I was clasping at straws.

33:20.619 --> 33:22.690
And Elliot Lloyd?

33:22.690 --> 33:25.865
I didn't kill Elliot Lloyd.

33:25.865 --> 33:29.248
How would I kill him?
I'd need a truck.

33:29.248 --> 33:30.629
Look at me.

33:30.629 --> 33:33.321
I could barely carry
that bloody seagull

33:33.321 --> 33:35.737
down Molly Stratton's path.

33:38.602 --> 33:42.399
This isn't just about saving
a beautiful building

33:42.399 --> 33:45.920
or preserving the local boozer.

33:46.852 --> 33:50.235
This is about destroying
something that got us through.

33:52.271 --> 33:55.067
That place probably saved lives.

34:05.319 --> 34:06.906
You go and get Winnie and I'll
meet you at the station,

34:06.906 --> 34:08.322
- alright?
- Alright.

34:08.322 --> 34:09.909
Alright?

34:09.909 --> 34:11.256
I think we've got this
all wrong.

34:11.256 --> 34:13.292
What do you mean?

34:13.292 --> 34:14.776
Well, we assumed that the person
that wrote the notes

34:14.776 --> 34:16.675
is the same person
that killed Elliot Lloyd,

34:16.675 --> 34:19.264
but I don't think
the two things are connected.

34:19.264 --> 34:21.852
I think those notes have been
a massive distraction.

34:22.957 --> 34:25.339
Guv, just got the call
from forensics

34:25.339 --> 34:27.134
- with the PM and toxicology.
- Yeah.

34:27.134 --> 34:30.171
Elliot Lloyd had a vast amount
of alcohol in his system.

34:30.171 --> 34:32.725
No water was found in his lungs.

34:32.725 --> 34:34.762
So he was dead
before he hit the water.

34:34.762 --> 34:36.108
Exactly.

34:36.108 --> 34:38.800
Major trauma to the head.
Fractured skull.

34:38.800 --> 34:43.115
And get this, six cracked ribs
and internal bleeding.

34:43.115 --> 34:45.324
It's not as simple as a fight.

34:45.324 --> 34:47.499
It was major impact.
Something hit him.

34:51.503 --> 34:52.573
What?

34:52.573 --> 34:53.988
Something Winnie said.

35:33.441 --> 35:36.306
Oh, Lauren, Lauren!

35:36.306 --> 35:38.308
I've got your keys
for The Dolphin.

35:38.308 --> 35:39.758
Thanks.

35:47.904 --> 35:49.526
Sorry.

35:49.526 --> 35:51.010
It's fine.

35:54.876 --> 35:57.085
I suppose the sale's
on hold now, is it?

35:57.085 --> 35:58.949
With all the buyers
being suspects.

35:58.949 --> 36:00.468
Yeah.

36:02.505 --> 36:04.438
Anything else
I can help you with?

36:04.438 --> 36:05.611
Sorry, it's just
I've got a viewing.

36:05.611 --> 36:07.095
I've really got to go.

36:07.095 --> 36:09.719
It must be a drag getting
the bus to your viewings.

36:12.894 --> 36:14.586
What, you go in your trainers
and then you put your heels on

36:14.586 --> 36:15.587
when you get there, yeah?

36:15.587 --> 36:17.968
Yeah, something like that.

36:17.968 --> 36:20.350
It's funny, 'cause
I thought you drove.

36:20.350 --> 36:21.213
I do.

36:22.352 --> 36:23.457
Why you getting the bus, then?

36:25.217 --> 36:27.461
Uh, the car's in...

36:28.358 --> 36:29.704
...for a service.

36:33.846 --> 36:35.986
On the night of the murder,
you said that

36:35.986 --> 36:37.436
you came back here
and worked late.

36:39.576 --> 36:42.786
W-- Elliot Lloyd
was popping corks

36:42.786 --> 36:45.237
like there was no tomorrow,
and I was working.

36:45.237 --> 36:47.584
And I had to get back here.

36:47.584 --> 36:49.828
But you had some champagne
before you left?

36:50.829 --> 36:51.968
What, a couple?

36:51.968 --> 36:53.383
Something like that.

36:54.798 --> 36:56.490
And you came back here
till midnight?

36:57.422 --> 36:59.251
Well, it could have
been 1:00-ish.

37:01.253 --> 37:02.703
That's a long day.

37:04.291 --> 37:05.602
Yeah, well, I'm the boss now.

37:05.602 --> 37:07.949
I'm just trying
to get it all done.

37:07.949 --> 37:11.263
I mean, I wouldn't hear the last
of it if I dropped the ball.

37:11.263 --> 37:13.058
You must have been knackered.

37:14.335 --> 37:16.751
18-hour days? I mean,
believe me, I've been there.

37:16.751 --> 37:18.822
It's hard to function.

37:18.822 --> 37:21.135
Yeah, I'm alright.

37:21.135 --> 37:22.930
I'll do whatever it takes
to get it all done.

37:22.930 --> 37:25.829
What, like drive when you're
so tired you can't see?

37:34.942 --> 37:36.046
Lauren?

37:38.463 --> 37:39.705
Don't.

37:48.576 --> 37:51.476
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

37:51.476 --> 37:53.098
And...

37:53.098 --> 37:54.686
the noise was awful.

37:55.790 --> 37:58.724
He just-- just lurched
out of nowhere.

37:58.724 --> 38:00.588
The-- The-- Into the road.

38:00.588 --> 38:02.280
This-- This m-man.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.524
And I thought there was a car
or-- or a wall or...

38:10.909 --> 38:12.704
So what did you do?

38:12.704 --> 38:15.465
Well, I-I got out.

38:15.465 --> 38:19.814
And there was this heap
in the road

38:19.814 --> 38:21.713
on the passenger side and...

38:23.404 --> 38:26.131
And I saw that
it was Elliot Lloyd.

38:26.131 --> 38:29.168
I mean, of all people,
bloody Elliot Lloyd.

38:30.998 --> 38:31.999
And...

38:33.587 --> 38:36.969
His eyes were open, so I
slapped him across the face,

38:36.969 --> 38:38.350
because I didn't know
what else to do.

38:38.350 --> 38:39.593
I mean, what do you do?

38:39.593 --> 38:41.698
You call the police.

38:41.698 --> 38:43.390
Or an ambulance.

38:43.390 --> 38:44.736
You could have called
your dad, Lauren.

38:46.116 --> 38:48.498
The very last person
I could have called.

38:52.053 --> 38:55.505
And you managed to get the body
in the car, and no one saw?

38:57.749 --> 38:58.922
Just...

39:00.752 --> 39:03.202
...put him in the car and drove.

39:03.202 --> 39:05.066
Down to Tankerton slopes.

39:10.658 --> 39:13.799
I drove down onto the beach and...

39:16.008 --> 39:17.389
...and pulled him out.

39:19.253 --> 39:21.669
And I left him there
and drove off.

39:25.742 --> 39:26.847
Okay.

39:28.676 --> 39:29.884
It's good that you told me.

39:34.544 --> 39:36.028
I'll be back in a minute.

40:00.674 --> 40:02.917
It's awful.

40:02.917 --> 40:05.057
She was just trying
to keep it all together.

40:05.057 --> 40:06.645
Make her dad proud.

40:08.682 --> 40:11.305
Well, you did it again.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.446
Did what?

40:14.446 --> 40:16.068
Solved the case.

40:19.658 --> 40:20.901
Well, we both did.

40:20.901 --> 40:23.351
Yeah, make a good team,
don't we?

40:26.700 --> 40:28.736
Yeah.
I-I'd better, um...

40:28.736 --> 40:30.531
Yeah, me too. Um...

40:33.258 --> 40:34.466
I'll see you.

40:34.466 --> 40:36.088
Yeah. Oh.

40:47.859 --> 40:49.481
Hey.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.103
Hi.

40:51.103 --> 40:52.829
They look happier.

40:52.829 --> 40:56.695
Well, they were treated
to a marriage guidance session.

40:56.695 --> 40:58.352
Courtesy of moi.

40:58.352 --> 40:59.905
You gave them couples therapy?

40:59.905 --> 41:02.287
Oi.
I'm a wise old bird.

41:02.287 --> 41:03.564
I notice things.

41:03.564 --> 41:06.256
In fact, I'm thinking
of retraining.

41:06.256 --> 41:08.604
Oh, don't make me laugh.

41:08.604 --> 41:10.882
Ah, here comes another one
who needs his head examining.

41:10.882 --> 41:13.574
- You can't say that, Mum.
- Oh, I so can.

41:13.574 --> 41:15.714
He moves in with one person

41:15.714 --> 41:19.684
and then he can't keep away
from another.

41:19.684 --> 41:21.858
You alright?
You look like you need a beer.

41:22.997 --> 41:24.965
Thanks.
I think.

41:26.725 --> 41:28.727
Found a house yet?

41:28.727 --> 41:30.729
- No. Not yet.
- No, nothing out there?

41:34.008 --> 41:36.079
Nothing that feels like home,
you know?

41:37.115 --> 41:38.185
You alright?

41:40.152 --> 41:41.429
Yeah.
Fine.

41:43.017 --> 41:47.746
Oh, well, I've heard of a pub
that's going begging.

41:47.746 --> 41:49.817
Oh.
Nah, you're alright.

41:49.817 --> 41:51.439
Alright, Molly?

41:54.339 --> 41:55.547
I need your advice.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.445
Is this relationship-associated?

41:57.445 --> 42:00.552
Because if so, you've come
to the right place.

42:00.552 --> 42:01.553
No!

42:02.968 --> 42:05.384
Who do I sell the pub to?

42:05.384 --> 42:10.942
The second and third offers were
so much lower than, um... his.

42:10.942 --> 42:13.185
Well, what you asking her for?

42:13.185 --> 42:14.739
Why don't you sell it
to both of 'em?

42:14.739 --> 42:16.430
Let Sammy Grady
manage the kitchen,

42:16.430 --> 42:17.983
and him and his family
can live upstairs.

42:17.983 --> 42:20.365
And then let the community group
manage the pub.

42:20.365 --> 42:21.711
Then everyone's happy.

42:21.711 --> 42:23.851
Well, that's never gonna work,
is it?

42:23.851 --> 42:26.336
Molly, why don't you
have a drink?

42:26.336 --> 42:27.717
On the house.

42:27.717 --> 42:30.133
And I'll sort it out.

42:30.133 --> 42:31.825
Sorry, go on.
What were you saying?

42:35.622 --> 42:38.383
Spaghetti al polpo coming up!

42:38.383 --> 42:39.591
Alright, Mike.

42:41.075 --> 42:43.422
Do we think that eight tentacles
will be enough?

42:43.422 --> 42:44.872
Could have gone with 16,

42:44.872 --> 42:46.633
thought that might be
a bit too leggy.
