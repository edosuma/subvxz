WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:07.708
Gibbs.
Hey, morning,
Henry.

00:07.741 --> 00:10.578
That sushi place
you sent me to?

00:10.611 --> 00:11.779
What, you didn't like it?

00:11.812 --> 00:13.447
Liked it fine.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.515
Only you didn't tell me

00:14.548 --> 00:16.184
I had to speak
Japanese to order.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.385
You don't order.

00:17.418 --> 00:21.089
You eat what you're served
with a smile.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.556
It's like being married.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.559
( metal detector alarm )

00:27.495 --> 00:29.297
I hope that doesn't
mean I can't come in.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.134
Now just hold your horses.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.568
I wasn't going
to hurt anybody with it.

00:34.602 --> 00:35.603
It's evidence.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.107
Yeah. It's okay.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.674
Come on in.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.576
( metal detector beeps )

00:42.610 --> 00:43.711
( wand beeps )

00:43.744 --> 00:45.246
You wearing jewelry?

00:45.279 --> 00:47.115
Oh, I forgot.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.382
Senior moment.

00:53.687 --> 00:54.788
Henry,

00:54.822 --> 00:59.327
we're in the presence of
a Medal of Honor recipient.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.297
Special Agent
Jethro Gibbs, NCIS.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.432
Mister...

01:04.465 --> 01:07.201
Yost.
Corporal Ernie Yost.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.237
Special Agent, huh?

01:09.270 --> 01:10.604
Just the man I'm looking for.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.573
Be an honor
to help you, sir.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.875
Say that after
you know why I'm here.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.511
That have something to
do with this evidence
you're delivering?

01:20.548 --> 01:23.551
I murdered a marine
with that .45.

01:28.489 --> 01:32.460
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:32.493 --> 01:36.430
and CBS

02:09.663 --> 02:12.833
The Washington Ballet
is totally sold out.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.034
You're kidding.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.704
People were backed up trying
to hack into the box office.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.372
God, I can't believe that.

02:18.406 --> 02:21.642
Since when are you
interested in the ballet?

02:21.675 --> 02:24.745
Since about an hour ago.

02:24.778 --> 02:25.813
Let me guess--

02:25.846 --> 02:28.582
the cashier at the bakery
was wearing leg warmers.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.584
How do you know that?

02:30.618 --> 02:32.753
Must be the profiler in me.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.189
Oh, hey, there's another
ballet in town, DiNozzo.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.657
I can get you
two front row easy.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.360
Really? What ballet?

02:39.393 --> 02:40.528
The National.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.929
The National Ballet?

02:41.962 --> 02:43.364
Bravo, McGee.

02:43.397 --> 02:46.467
Oh. Only...

02:46.500 --> 02:47.601
Only what?

02:47.635 --> 02:48.769
The nation...

02:48.802 --> 02:50.904
Is not ours.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.373
Surinam.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.775
Surinam?

02:54.808 --> 02:57.645
The National Ballet
of Surinam.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.879
How good can that be?

02:58.912 --> 03:01.515
Depends on how much
you like her buns, Tony.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.616
GIBBS:
DiNozzo.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.318
Make Mr. Yost here comfortable.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.553
Mm-hmm.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.388
You want me to be comfortable,

03:07.421 --> 03:09.457
slap a pair of handcuffs on me.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.691
How about something else?

03:10.724 --> 03:12.960
Any good at foot massages?

03:12.993 --> 03:14.528
Kate.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.863
McGee.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.467
Let me get that for you.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.572
I found him downstairs.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.275
He claims to have murdered
a marine with this .45.

03:29.042 --> 03:29.910
You believe him?

03:29.943 --> 03:31.979
He's a little foggy
on the where and when,

03:32.012 --> 03:33.747
but pretty adamant he did it.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.322
Gibbs, we're not going
to investigate this?

03:41.355 --> 03:42.790
No...

03:42.823 --> 03:43.924
Good.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.293
We're just going to humor him.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.093
McGee.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.728
Says he's been
reporting this to 911,

03:47.761 --> 03:49.430
can't get anybody
to believe him.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.698
Gee, what a surprise.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.500
Trace the call.
I want to hear one of them.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.801
On it.
Kate.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.436
He's a former marine.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.405
Probably WWII.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.540
Corporal Ernest Yost.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.309
Dig up his SRB.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.676
Got a social
security number?

04:02.710 --> 04:05.379
They didn't use them
for serial numbers
when he served.

04:05.413 --> 04:08.449
So how am I supposed
to get his SRB without
a serial number?

04:08.482 --> 04:10.050
Well, Kate,
you could ask him.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.953
Gibbs, I doubt that he could
remember his shoe size.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.555
Corporal Yost.
Yo.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.789
Serial number.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.425
330090, sir.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.660
Or you could just
look him up under

04:19.693 --> 04:21.762
Medal of Honor recipients.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.733
He won the Medal of Honor?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.635
You don't win
the Medal of Honor, Kate,

04:27.668 --> 04:28.736
you're awarded it

04:28.769 --> 04:30.404
for conspicuous gallantry

04:30.438 --> 04:32.606
above and beyond
the call of duty.

04:36.009 --> 04:40.448
You, uh, got any use
for a Metro ticket?

04:40.481 --> 04:41.582
Got ten rides left.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.951
Don't want to waste 'em.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.587
Ah... no, thanks.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.956
Come on, too much waste
in this world.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.558
Everything's disposable now.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.893
Disposable cameras,
disposable razors.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.062
I won't be needing it.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.864
I drive.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.733
Oh.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.669
They took my license away.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.904
How come?

05:03.937 --> 05:07.441
Got old.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.909
It's a fatal mistake.

05:08.942 --> 05:12.513
But I can fly anywhere.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.781
For free.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.082
But I, uh...

05:15.115 --> 05:18.786
I don't have anybody
to visit anymore.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.022
I'm sorry.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.524
What a waste.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.327
How'd you score
a sweet deal like that?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.946
What do we have here, Gibbs?

05:45.979 --> 05:47.080
Murder weapon.

05:49.717 --> 05:50.684
Cold case?

05:50.718 --> 05:52.586
Icicles.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.926
Hmm. It's rust...
from potassium chlorate

05:58.959 --> 06:00.861
in the powder mix.
Hasn't been fired recently.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.130
They didn't even use
this kind of ammo

06:03.163 --> 06:05.098
when you were in
the marines, Gibbs.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.471
Check out the muzzle end
of the slide.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.641
See that coloring
mismatch?

06:13.674 --> 06:16.444
That's from hardening after
the finish was applied.

06:16.477 --> 06:20.113
This weapon is circa
early 1940s.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.149
A year or two before
I joined the Corps.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.389
Dirt?

06:31.191 --> 06:32.192
Looks like black sand.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.761
Trace its origin.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.529
Don't I always?

06:35.563 --> 06:37.865
Hey, Gibbs, you gonna tell me
what this is about?

06:37.898 --> 06:40.934
A marine who doesn't clean
his weapon after firing it.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.704
Wow.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.707
Things must be
really slow upstairs.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.976
YOST:
I never said I shot him.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.679
I beat him to death with it,
over the head.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.180
Who?

06:53.213 --> 06:57.184
My buddy.
Corporal Wade Kean.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.686
Why?

06:58.719 --> 07:00.654
Why?

07:00.688 --> 07:02.556
Why would you kill
your buddy?

07:02.590 --> 07:06.026
I don't think
he believes me, kid.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.194
Me either.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.195
And what do you know?

07:08.228 --> 07:09.830
You weren't even a gleam
in your old man's eye.

07:09.863 --> 07:10.831
Mr. Yost.

07:10.864 --> 07:11.932
Yeah, yeah.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.534
Yeah, I know.
I know.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.535
Why?

07:14.568 --> 07:15.669
Is that all he's
gonna ask me?

07:15.703 --> 07:17.805
Pretty much,
till he gets an answer.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.809
All right.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.210
You want an answer?

07:23.243 --> 07:26.980
I'll give you an answer.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.785
I don't know why.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.658
You don't know why?

07:37.691 --> 07:38.826
No.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.629
Okay.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.097
Then I don't believe
you killed him, Mr. Yost.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.100
Why won't anybody
believe I killed him?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.136
I smashed him
over the head.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.971
I beat his brains in.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.106
Blood was coming out of his...

07:53.140 --> 07:54.608
Calm down, Mr. Yost.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.946
Relax.
Where's my .45?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.582
Where's my .45?
I had it when I came in.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.184
I have your .45.
You gave it to me.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.119
Good. Good.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.756
You see, that's evidence.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.726
That'll prove that I...

08:12.760 --> 08:15.763
that I...

08:18.265 --> 08:20.033
Tony, get him a drink of water.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.003
All right.
Come with me, Mr. Yost.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.304
Water cooler's

08:24.337 --> 08:25.939
right over here.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.274
It's not a water cooler,

08:27.307 --> 08:28.876
it's called a scuttlebutt.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.612
How long you been
in the Corps, kid?

08:31.645 --> 08:33.747
Since I met Gibbs.

08:33.781 --> 08:35.248
This way.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.122
Boss...

08:42.155 --> 08:43.991
Winchester, Virginia P.D.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.728
got seven 911 calls from Yost
during the past 11 days.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.896
Let me hear the last one.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.633
OPERATOR:
911.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.267
YOST:
Hi. Do you have a pencil
and paper ready?

08:54.301 --> 08:55.903
Sir, I have a computer.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.671
What is the emergency
you wish to report?

08:57.705 --> 08:59.172
There's a dead man.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.309
Actually, it's not
an emergency for him, anymore.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.311
He's dead.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.580
The emergency is for me.

09:06.614 --> 09:09.082
See, it's getting late
in the day, very late.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.884
Mr. Yost, is this
you, again?

09:10.918 --> 09:13.086
I've heard enough.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.822
Police investigated
a couple of times.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.356
Found him to be inebriated

09:16.389 --> 09:18.091
and that he started
making the calls

09:18.125 --> 09:20.260
when his wife passed away.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.364
His citation of
conspicuous gallantry

09:24.397 --> 09:26.667
above and beyond
the call of duty.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.703

10:14.915 --> 10:15.949
What?

10:17.317 --> 10:19.853
We just heard about
your wife, Mr. Yost.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.724
You have our sympathies, sir.

10:23.757 --> 10:27.828
Thank you.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.362
Buried her two weeks ago.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.800
Ball's Bluff
National Cemetery.

10:32.833 --> 10:37.137
We were married 58 years.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.873
Dorothy...

10:39.907 --> 10:42.776
she was a peach.

10:56.323 --> 11:01.328
She was... a peach.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.764
Now can we get on with this?

11:03.797 --> 11:06.767
( telephone rings )
You're not in custody, Mr. Yost.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.801
Now don't say that,
Agent Gibbs.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.303
I didn't get anything
for dinner tonight.
Gibbs.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.840
I'd love to buy you dinner,
Mr. Yost.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.342
You would?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.811
Me, too.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.046
She asked first.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.080
GIBBS:
We don't know yet.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.448
Video conference. Five minutes.

11:21.481 --> 11:25.252
DiNozzo, entertain Mr. Yost
a little while longer.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.054
That mean
you're gonna hold me?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.722
No.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.190
FAITH COLEMAN:
Oh, yes, you will.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.459
You see this seal,
Special Agent Gibbs?

11:32.492 --> 11:35.796
You recognize the signature?
Yeah.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.931
Your eyesight isn't
as bad as they say.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.733
How did SECNAV
get involved in this?

11:39.767 --> 11:43.236
Apparently, letters from Medal
of Honor recipients get read.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.205
Yost wrote him?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.406
More than wrote,

11:46.439 --> 11:49.943
he confessed to murdering
a Corporal Wade Kean, U.S.M.C.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.812
Did he say where?
No.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.213
When?
No.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.481
Why?

11:54.514 --> 11:55.949
No. And that's why you're going

11:55.983 --> 11:58.118
to open a case,
to get those answers.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.021
Commander, this man
stood tall in hell.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.956
His wife just died.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.892
( sighs )

12:04.925 --> 12:07.828
He does get loaded sometimes.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.463
Even when he's not loaded,
he's loaded.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.432
Decisions over competency
to stand trial

12:12.465 --> 12:13.566
are not yours to make.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.469
They are for experts in
neuro-psychiatry and a court.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.206
Now let me ask you one question,
Special Agent Gibbs.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.808
Just one?

12:20.841 --> 12:24.177
What's the statute
of limitations on murder?

12:33.220 --> 12:34.955
( tape recorder clicks )

12:34.988 --> 12:37.524
Statement of Mr. Ernie Yost,

12:37.557 --> 12:39.960
Medal of Honor recipient,

12:39.993 --> 12:44.164
to NCIS Special Agent
L. Jethro Gibbs.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.233
"Jethro."

12:46.266 --> 12:49.002
I used to know a ballplayer
named Jethro.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.037
Negro League.

12:52.572 --> 12:55.242
Do you understand your rights?

12:55.275 --> 12:56.509
Oh, sure, sure.

12:56.543 --> 13:00.113
That Italian kid read 'em to me.
Di... Di...

13:00.147 --> 13:01.849
DiNozzo.

13:01.882 --> 13:02.983
Tony.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.885
YOST:
I think he'd make
a heck of a ballplayer.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.087
TONY:
Promised me a tryout.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.989
Said he used to be
a scout for the Senators.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.523
How sad.

13:10.557 --> 13:14.361
You're obviously too old
to be a professional ballplayer.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.131
Like I told you,

13:18.165 --> 13:21.869
I killed my best friend-- Wade.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.138
Why?

13:25.172 --> 13:27.240
Now, that again?

13:27.274 --> 13:29.843
If you want me to charge you.

13:29.877 --> 13:34.147
You know, Wade could do a kip.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.215
A kip-up.

13:35.248 --> 13:40.120
He'd lay flat on his back
on the barracks deck,

13:40.153 --> 13:43.590
and in one move,
he'd jerk his body--

13:43.623 --> 13:45.993
land on his feet.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.160
Ever see anybody do anything
like that, huh?

13:47.194 --> 13:51.531
Boy, you wouldn't
forget.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.234
Man.

13:58.471 --> 14:02.175
I-I got this...

14:02.209 --> 14:04.144
Metro card here.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.314
I got ten rides left.
You want it?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.284
No, thanks.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.153
Yeah. Seems silly.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.459
Wade.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.429
All I remember...

14:22.462 --> 14:25.933
is, is killing him.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.369
All right, Mr. Yost.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.371
I'll have Tony
give you a ride home.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.605
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.507
I'm trying to remember,
you know?

14:34.541 --> 14:37.144
I know you need
to know why.

14:37.177 --> 14:40.613
That would be nice.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.951
All right.

14:43.984 --> 14:48.521
You know, I think...

14:48.655 --> 14:52.125
I think...

14:52.159 --> 14:55.095
it was him or me.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.531
Yeah.

14:58.565 --> 15:02.435
Yeah, that's it.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.604
Him or me.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.377
I picked up his pistol...

15:10.410 --> 15:14.948
I smashed his brains in.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.950
Smashed his brains in!
Smashed his brains in!

15:16.984 --> 15:19.652
We were all covered
with blood!

15:19.686 --> 15:20.587
You don't have to remember it
anymore, Mr. Yost.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.123
Take a deep breath.
Take deeps breaths.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.492
Breathe, breathe.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.928
Breathe.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.506
Smells like rotten eggs in here.

15:42.209 --> 15:46.079
Tony, let's get
Mr. Yost some air.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.249
Well?

15:49.282 --> 15:53.053
I'm a Medical Examiner,
I'm not a psychiatrist.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.354
I won't sue you, Duck.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.090
Well, he reminds me
of my great uncle
William in Bristol.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.591
We'd visit
every Christmas.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.294
He was always apologizing
for sitting naked

16:01.328 --> 16:02.495
at the dinner table.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.531
He wasn't naked, was he?

16:04.564 --> 16:06.733
No. Aunt Gertrude was.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.535
I'm, I'm, sorry, Gibbs.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.171
My point is my uncle
was a little dotty...

16:11.204 --> 16:12.405
as is your
Mr. Yost.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.473
Ducky,

16:13.506 --> 16:15.408
what do you think
he smelled in there?

16:15.442 --> 16:17.277
I hesitate to ask.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.278
Nothing.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.147
It was in his mind.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.149
He was back on Iwo.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.284
The sulfur island.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.153
Sulfur smells
like rotten eggs.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.155
Good news...
I think.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.323
It's not good
if you have to
think about it.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.192
Corporal Wade Kean
was killed in action

16:32.225 --> 16:33.493
on Iwo Jima
March 3rd, 1945

16:33.526 --> 16:36.063
according to the Marine Corps
casualty list.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.631
It's the day before
Yost was cited for gallantry.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.700
That means
he didn't kill him, right?

16:40.733 --> 16:42.635
If no one witnessed
the murder,

16:42.669 --> 16:45.238
Yost alleges committing,
they'd assume

16:45.272 --> 16:46.673
that Corporal Kean
was killed

16:46.706 --> 16:47.740
by the Japanese.

16:47.774 --> 16:48.975
I'm sorry, Kate.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.145
It doesn't really prove anything
except a brave Marine died.

16:52.179 --> 16:55.748
Ducky, say Yost's best friend
was killed in action.

16:55.782 --> 16:56.816
What's he feel?

16:56.849 --> 17:00.753
Pain. Anger. Relief.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.422
Survivor's guilt.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.724
He's glad it's not him.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.093
He hate's himself
for that feeling.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.094
Exactly.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.130
The next night,
Yost's in hand-to-hand combat.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.198
So he confused

17:11.231 --> 17:13.133
killing a
Japanese soldier

17:13.166 --> 17:14.367
with killing
his friend!

17:14.401 --> 17:16.169
This all started
when his wife died.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.371
Survivor's guilt
again, Duck?

17:18.405 --> 17:20.107
Wait, wait, wait.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.275
You're onto something there.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.510
But how do you prove it to him?

17:23.543 --> 17:26.779
Kate, prepare an affidavit
to exhume the body

17:26.813 --> 17:29.182
of Marine Corporal Wade Kean.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.250
In Iwo Jima?

17:30.283 --> 17:31.584
He's not in Iwo Jima.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.521
We gave the island back
to Japan in '68.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.656
Every Marine buried there
was brought home.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.626
You find him and dig him up.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.532
( snoring )

17:45.565 --> 17:48.401
Oh-hoh! The Sands of Iwo Jima!

17:48.435 --> 17:51.838
( a la John Wayne ):
Guys make mistakes, I guess.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.376
But every one we make,

17:56.409 --> 17:59.279
the whole stack of chips
goes with it.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.680
Who said that?

18:00.713 --> 18:03.383
That's John Wayne!
Sergeant Striker?

18:03.416 --> 18:03.883
Come on.

18:03.916 --> 18:04.851
He's in the flick

18:04.884 --> 18:06.018
you're downloading.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.754
John Wayne is in
To The Shores
of Iwo Jima?'

18:07.787 --> 18:10.490
It's "Sands," McGee,
not "Shores."

18:10.523 --> 18:12.392
No, it's "Shores."

18:12.425 --> 18:13.360
You're going
to challenge me

18:13.393 --> 18:14.827
on the name of one of
the Duke's finest films?

18:14.861 --> 18:16.163
Tony, this is not
a Hollywood film.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.830
It's a Marine documentary.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.166
To the Shores of Iwo Jima.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.467
Wow, it's
the same footage.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.868
The Corps probably
let them use it.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.171
( snoring )

18:25.872 --> 18:27.240
GIBBS:
How's he doing?

18:27.274 --> 18:28.375
Listen to him.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.377
That To The Shores of Iwo Jima?

18:30.410 --> 18:31.411
Yeah. I thought
it might help.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.346
Good thought.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.647
When he wakes up,

18:34.681 --> 18:35.715
take him home.

18:35.748 --> 18:36.783
Will do.
Stay with him.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.751
I don't want him
to be alone.

18:38.785 --> 18:42.189
Oh, boss, I got tickets
to the National Ballet tonight.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.856
The National Ballet?

18:43.890 --> 18:46.459
Yeah. An-And the tickets
are really hard to get.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.395
Tell him, McGee.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.496
Um... well...

18:49.529 --> 18:50.397
What nation?

18:52.232 --> 18:53.466
It starts with an "S."

18:54.734 --> 18:56.736
Bed him down, DiNozzo.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.238
Stay with him.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.475
( groaning )

19:09.916 --> 19:12.585
GIBBS:
Can't be a coincidence.

19:12.619 --> 19:13.420
Yost's wife buried

19:13.453 --> 19:15.355
in the same cemetery
as Corporal Kean.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.689
Ah, Mr. Yost must
have requested

19:16.723 --> 19:18.225
the plot for he
and his wife

19:18.258 --> 19:19.692
decades ago to
be buried here.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.628
I mean, this section
of the cemetery

19:21.661 --> 19:23.696
has been filled
since the '70s.

19:23.730 --> 19:24.831
Left, right, left.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.833
Left, right, left.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.968
Left, right, left.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.438
Left, right, left.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.373
Left, right, left.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.476
Left, right, left.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.511
Left, right, left.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.547
Left, right, left.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.782
Left, right, left.

19:42.815 --> 19:46.185
Detail, halt.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.821
Left face.

19:51.558 --> 19:55.862
Marine burial detail present as
requested, Special Agent Gibbs.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.630
Thank you, Colonel.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.335
Now we're ready.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.309
DUCKY:
Skeletal remains as expected.

20:09.342 --> 20:12.412
They were buried only
in a canvas bag or a poncho,

20:12.445 --> 20:16.716
and the 20 years in sulfuric
soil takes it's toll.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.351
What's that in his teeth?

20:18.385 --> 20:19.786
Dog tag.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.821
When you were killed in action,

20:21.854 --> 20:24.857
one of your dog tags was
inserted between your teeth,

20:24.891 --> 20:27.694
your lower jaw was slammed shut,
locking it in place

20:27.727 --> 20:29.829
so the body could
always be identified.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.431
My God.

20:31.464 --> 20:34.834
Traumatized bilateral
amputation of the legs.

20:34.867 --> 20:35.935
Artillery shell?

20:35.968 --> 20:37.370
Land mine.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.372
Check the top
of the skull, Ducky.

20:40.607 --> 20:41.774
Here.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.884
Don't tell me.

20:51.918 --> 20:55.688
I'm afraid there is
a blunt-force fracture.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.600
You got to do it.

21:18.478 --> 21:22.549
Pattern mark's a rough fit.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.388
He said he was
bringing us evidence.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.070
Yost confessed in a
letter to the SECNAV.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.738
He surrendered
the murder weapon.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.540
Your own Medical
Examiner matched it

21:47.574 --> 21:50.076
to the tool mark on the
victim's skull fracture.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.878
What more do you want?

21:51.911 --> 21:52.745
A motive.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.747
I don't need a motive
to prosecute.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.783
I do.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.418
McGee!

22:00.453 --> 22:03.923
I picked up his pistol...

22:06.493 --> 22:08.361
And I hit him with it.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.796
I smashed... killed Wade.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.732
Smashed...
smashed his brains in!

22:12.765 --> 22:14.767
We were all covered with blood.

22:14.801 --> 22:15.902
You don't have to
remember any more.

22:15.935 --> 22:20.707
Deep breaths.
Breathe, breathe.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.878
GIBBS:
Look at him, Commander.

22:25.912 --> 22:29.015
Agony over something
he didn't do.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.418
How do you know?

22:31.451 --> 22:34.687
You ever been in combat?

22:34.721 --> 22:36.055
No.

22:36.088 --> 22:39.826
The only one you depend on
is the buddy next to you.

22:39.859 --> 22:43.530
He's closer to you
than your brother.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.898
Why would you
smash his head in?

22:45.932 --> 22:47.467
God only knows.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.603
Well, then, he had
better tell me

22:50.637 --> 22:53.139
'cause I don't understand
and neither does Yost.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.074
I'm tired of arguing with you,
Gibbs.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.943
Deliver Yost
to the Quantico brig.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.511
I can't do that.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.812
Damn it, Gibbs, do you think

22:59.846 --> 23:01.881
I want to incarcerate
an 82-year-old man?

23:01.914 --> 23:04.050
I'm following the
SECNAV's direct orders.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.184
He said investigate. You did.

23:05.217 --> 23:05.985
And found enough evidence

23:06.018 --> 23:07.687
to hold him over
for court-martial.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.320
Now, take him into custody.

23:08.354 --> 23:09.789
I said "can't" not wouldn't.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.661
Please don't insult me
by telling me he escaped.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.163
The older they are,
the sneakier they are.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.499
KATE:
Yost complained
of a weak bladder.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.701
He had to use the restroom
every ten minutes.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.503
We gave up escorting him
and one time

23:23.536 --> 23:25.071
he just didn't come back.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.606
McGEE:
We found a window open.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.708
He must have shimmied
down a drain pipe.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.077
Oh, I'd like to have seen that.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.679
We think the weak
bladder was a trick

23:32.712 --> 23:34.180
to get us to let
down our guard.

23:34.213 --> 23:35.748
KATE:
We're sick about
it, Commander.

23:35.782 --> 23:36.583
Yes, I can see that.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.017
You all look
absolutely devastated.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.886
McGEE:
I put out an APB.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.822
Airports, train stations,
taxi cabs.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.824
Walker rentals.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.898
All right, Gibbs, I'll give you
24 hours; that's it.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.502
I want Yost at the Quantico brig
at 0800 tomorrow.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.636
We'll be there.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.771
I don't give a damn
if you're there.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.172
Just make sure Yost is.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.947
Gibbs...

24:07.980 --> 24:09.949
maybe she's right.

24:09.982 --> 24:10.917
Commander Coleman admits

24:10.950 --> 24:12.919
that JAG doesn't want
to incarcerate him,

24:12.952 --> 24:16.756
so what's the worst
that can happen?

24:16.789 --> 24:19.025
Dishonorable Discharge...

24:19.058 --> 24:22.862
and loss of his Medal of Honor.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.498
I hadn't thought of that.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.767
Yeah, neither has Yost.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.737
And there's worse.

24:30.770 --> 24:33.506
A hero...

24:33.540 --> 24:38.511
could go to his grave carrying
a guilt he doesn't deserve.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.212
I won't let that happen.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.048
So what do we do?

24:42.081 --> 24:45.184
Find every living Marine who
served with Yost on Iwo Jima.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.219
If there is one.

24:48.688 --> 24:49.956
Right.

24:49.989 --> 24:50.723
McGee.

24:50.757 --> 24:51.558
Boss?

24:51.591 --> 24:52.559
I want you and Abby

24:52.592 --> 24:53.626
to reconstruct the battle.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.761
That Marine documentary

24:54.794 --> 24:55.962
you downloaded's a start.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.997
I want to follow
Corporals Yost and Kean

24:58.030 --> 24:59.131
minute-by-minute.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.602
From D-Day until Kean was killed
and Yost was evacuated.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.537
You got it, boss.

25:04.571 --> 25:06.272
I want it so real
I can smell the sulphur.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.507
Yeah.

25:20.319 --> 25:23.155
( marching band music playing )

25:23.189 --> 25:24.591
Hey...

25:25.825 --> 25:27.126
That was fun
last night.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.562
You got some arm on you, kid.

25:29.596 --> 25:30.697
TONY:
I was lucky.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.264
What?

25:32.298 --> 25:33.866
I said...

25:36.836 --> 25:38.070
( shuts off music )

25:39.706 --> 25:40.940
I said I was lucky.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.145
What's that?

25:46.178 --> 25:48.147
That's Wild Turkey, milk back.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.982
Want one?

25:50.016 --> 25:51.350
I don't think my stomach

25:51.383 --> 25:53.986
could handle it after
the chili dogs last night.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.689
I've been drinking one of these
every morning

25:56.723 --> 25:57.857
for almost 50 years.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.859
Semper fi.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.127
Got any coffee?

26:01.160 --> 26:03.229
Percolator in there.

26:03.262 --> 26:04.864
You know, speaking of luck.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.599
Let me tell you

26:06.633 --> 26:07.834
we almost didn't get to Iwo?

26:07.867 --> 26:08.835
No?

26:08.868 --> 26:13.640
We were in a 40-knot gale,
you know, and, uh,

26:13.673 --> 26:15.742
the ship was like
a roller coaster.

26:15.775 --> 26:16.876
Up one wave,

26:16.909 --> 26:18.310
down the next, you know.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.680
And me and Wade
are leaning railing

26:20.713 --> 26:22.749
puking like we had
spent the week

26:22.782 --> 26:25.151
in liberty at the slop shoot.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.353
And guess what happens.

26:27.386 --> 26:28.721
You fell in.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.990
No.

26:31.023 --> 26:34.326
A torpedo shoots out
of the water,

26:34.360 --> 26:37.196
zips over our heads
that close.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.965
Rides right into the sea.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.299
Right over the ship.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.869
I guess our number wasn't up.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.773
TONY:
So, what's it feel like?

26:46.806 --> 26:48.975
Smooth.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.810
Being a hero.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.078
I'm no hero.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.212
Medal says you are.

26:53.245 --> 26:57.216
The real heroes
never came back.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.919
They deserve that. Not me.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.353
Not me.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.090
I was scared to death.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.793
I don't even remember doing
what they said I did.

27:06.826 --> 27:09.696
You don't remember
killing all those
Japanese soldiers?

27:09.729 --> 27:11.363
No, it was like
someone else did it.

27:11.397 --> 27:14.967
And maybe somebody else did.
I don't know.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.403
Maybe it was someone
else who killed Wade.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.810
Hey, you want to look
at some pictures?

27:23.843 --> 27:25.277
Sure.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.378
First drawer there.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.382
That's it.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.418
Yowzer.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.224
Now, here you go,
here you go.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.391
There's me.

27:39.425 --> 27:43.162
There's Ferris Bellows,
Chip Stearns.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.197
And that's Wade next to me.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.398
Took this on the Canal.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.701
Guadalcanal?

27:48.735 --> 27:52.104
Yeah. Two days before
I got hit in the chest.

27:52.138 --> 27:55.241
You got wounded at Guadalcanal
and then they sent you to Iwo?

27:55.274 --> 27:57.910
Not only me, but a lot
of Marines, you know.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.378
Chip got hit on the Canal.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.981
Caught one in the butt.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.116
( laughing )

28:04.150 --> 28:05.818
We never let him
forget it.

28:07.754 --> 28:10.823
Ah...

28:10.857 --> 28:16.162
Nambu cut him down on Iwo.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.936
Uh, here, here.

28:23.970 --> 28:27.439
This is my Dorothy.

28:27.473 --> 28:28.908
TONY:
Oh, man,

28:28.941 --> 28:30.743
she's hot.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.278
Sorry, Ernie.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.747
It's okay, kid.
She was hot.

28:34.781 --> 28:37.917
She was the cutest
Navy nurse in Hawaii.

28:37.950 --> 28:38.985
Is that how
you two met?

28:39.018 --> 28:42.321
Yep. Now, I don't even remember
the hospital ship.

28:42.354 --> 28:45.291
But when I finally
opened my eyes on Oahu

28:45.324 --> 28:47.794
she was the first thing I saw.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.261
Love at first sight.

28:49.295 --> 28:52.298
So, you two get married before
you shipped out to Iwo Jima?

28:52.331 --> 28:53.332
No, no.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.802
We had to wait
until after the war--

28:55.835 --> 28:58.304
her being an officer
and me enlisted.

28:58.337 --> 29:03.175
I would lay in my rack at night
and ache for her.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.211
I bet your buddies
were jealous.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.348
Who told you that?

29:09.381 --> 29:11.784
Nobody.

29:11.818 --> 29:15.187
She's gorgeous.
I'm just saying,

29:15.221 --> 29:17.423
who wouldn't be jealous?

29:21.493 --> 29:23.762
I have to take a whiz.

29:26.265 --> 29:30.236
ABBY:
Iwo Jima: five miles long,

29:30.269 --> 29:31.403
half that in width.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.572
27,000 Japanese dug in

29:33.605 --> 29:35.341
so deep that ten weeks

29:35.374 --> 29:37.076
of bombardment
couldn't touch them.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.946
One out of every three Marines
at Iwo Jima was a casualty.

29:39.979 --> 29:42.514
The Japanese had 800 pill boxes
and three miles of tunnels

29:42.548 --> 29:43.515
on this tiny little island.

29:43.549 --> 29:44.817
McGEE:
The Marines hoped to take

29:44.851 --> 29:46.819
Mount Suribachi
on the first day.

29:46.853 --> 29:49.255
ABBY:
It took five before
the famous flag raising.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.823
And then the battle
went on for about

29:50.857 --> 29:51.790
a month after that.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.960
It was actually the second flag
to be raised.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.094
The first was too small
to be seen

29:55.127 --> 29:56.028
by all the Marines
on the island.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.464
Hey, I an only interested
in two Marines--

29:58.497 --> 29:59.966
Corporals Yost and Kean.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.034
Gibbs, we're trying to give you
background here.

30:02.068 --> 30:03.469
I got that, Abby,
at Parris Island.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.438
Okay. D-Day. 0900.

30:06.472 --> 30:07.339
Blue Beach one.

30:07.373 --> 30:08.875
Corporals Yost and Kean

30:08.908 --> 30:11.944
land with the 25th Regiment
of the Fourth Division.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.246
They're about to take
the airfields

30:14.280 --> 30:15.114
with the Third Division

30:15.147 --> 30:17.249
while the Fifth Division
takes Suribachi

30:17.283 --> 30:18.951
and advances up the west coast.

30:18.985 --> 30:21.187
First airfield falls on D-Day
and they sweep up the east shore

30:21.220 --> 30:23.956
toward the sulphur quarry
and Airfield 2.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.325
Estimates were
five days, ten max.

30:26.358 --> 30:27.326
McGEE:
Over two weeks later

30:27.359 --> 30:28.861
they're still trying to take

30:28.895 --> 30:31.330
that second airfield.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.633
Corporal Kean's body
was found here: Turkey Knob.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.402
The next night, Yost was cited
for the Medal of Honor

30:36.435 --> 30:38.337
here; about 500 yards away.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.939
What's this here?

30:39.972 --> 30:40.940
It's the gap

30:40.973 --> 30:43.242
between the Fourth
and Third Division lines.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.610
The night
that Corporal Kean died

30:44.643 --> 30:45.577
the Japanese had amassed

30:45.611 --> 30:48.114
several hundred troops
for a banzai charge.

30:48.147 --> 30:49.548
McGEE:
They were getting desperate.
See, up until then

30:49.581 --> 30:52.885
they'd only fought
from inside the bunkers.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.254
Kean was killed here
below this cave mouth.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.455
Within spitting distance.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.190
He'd stepped on a land mine.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.225
He'd blown off

30:59.258 --> 31:00.893
both his legs.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.561
He was in severe pain.

31:02.594 --> 31:06.632
This ditch runs north where
the Japanese were massing.

31:06.665 --> 31:09.235
They had to pass within yards
of Kean and Yost.

31:11.303 --> 31:15.374
You think... Yost hit him in
the head to keep him quiet?

31:15.407 --> 31:17.276
Well,
that's got to be it.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.245
He had no reason kill him.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.580
He was his buddy.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.582
Ernie?

31:23.615 --> 31:26.318
Hold your horses. I'm coming.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.687
Bet you never had a ham
and cheese like this.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.091
You see, I mix mayo
with mustard and...

31:32.124 --> 31:34.226
Is this Wade and Dorothy?

31:38.030 --> 31:40.899
Looks like a high school photo.

31:48.140 --> 31:51.177
It was the Senior Prom.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.245
She was Queen.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.614
He was King.

31:55.647 --> 31:59.618
Wade knew Dorothy before you.

32:02.288 --> 32:05.992
Ernie, were they sweethearts?

32:18.304 --> 32:20.739
GIBBS:
I don't believe it.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.374
There's a man in Boston
who does.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.747
KATE:
Commander Coleman is
going to use this

32:28.780 --> 32:31.250
to put Yost away for
the rest of his life.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.518
Do we have to tell her?

32:32.551 --> 32:36.155
Well, no, Special Agent
DiNozzo, here at NCIS,

32:36.188 --> 32:38.590
we just report evidence
we like.

32:38.624 --> 32:42.494
Colonel Gibbs, it doesn't
change your theory.

32:42.528 --> 32:46.265
Corporal Kean was in
pain from his wounds.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.766
Yost knocked him out

32:47.799 --> 32:51.337
to keep his cries from alerting
passing Japanese.

32:51.370 --> 32:55.141
So, over the years, Yost begins
questioning himself.

32:55.174 --> 32:58.177
Did he have to hit him
that hard to silence him or...

32:58.210 --> 33:01.313
did he do it to get the woman
that they both loved?

33:01.347 --> 33:05.251
Well, I tracked down
Private Bellows.

33:05.284 --> 33:08.687
He, uh, was in Vegas last month,
playing blackjack.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.490
Double-down on two aces,
caught two queens.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.559
Reached for his chips,
and dropped dead.

33:13.592 --> 33:17.329
Bellows' death makes Yost
the last surviving Marine

33:17.363 --> 33:19.231
from his unit on Iwo.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.399
KATE:
It's just so hard
to believe

33:20.432 --> 33:21.700
that there's nobody left
on the planet

33:21.733 --> 33:23.335
who was there that night.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.447
YOST:
You guys like Benny Goodman?

33:36.715 --> 33:38.617
I'm a... Artie Shaw
man, myself.

33:38.650 --> 33:42.221
Now, don't get me wrong--
Benny Goodman was great.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.490
But Artie Shaw-- whew!

33:44.523 --> 33:46.225
When he lifted
that clarinet...

33:46.258 --> 33:47.393
( chuckles )

33:47.426 --> 33:49.628
Boy, did we
argue about that!

33:49.661 --> 33:53.099
Wade loved Goodman.
Me...

33:53.132 --> 33:54.766
Artie Shaw, any day.

33:56.568 --> 33:57.803
You dance?

33:59.138 --> 34:01.173
Yes. Sure.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.408
( laughs gently )

34:04.210 --> 34:09.481
* When they begin the beguine

34:09.515 --> 34:15.121
* Brings back the sound
of music so tender *

34:15.154 --> 34:20.692
* It brings back a night
of tropical splendor *

34:20.726 --> 34:26.665
* It brings back a memory
evergreen... *

34:26.698 --> 34:32.404
( Yost humming melody )

34:37.609 --> 34:42.281
* Is past all endeavor...

34:42.314 --> 34:46.318
( continues humming )

34:51.890 --> 34:53.325
( elevator bell dings )

34:56.195 --> 34:57.896
Where's Gibbs?

34:57.929 --> 35:00.166
TONY:
And a good afternoon to you,
too, Commander Coleman.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.567
He was to deliver Corporal Yost
to me...

35:01.600 --> 35:03.469
Present and accounted
for, sir.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.172
...0800...

35:06.205 --> 35:07.606
You're Ernest Yost?

35:07.639 --> 35:09.508
Yes, ma'am.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.877
TONY:
This is Lieutenant Commander
Coleman, Ernie.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.879
JAG Corps.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.882
She's here to, uh...
arrest you.

35:16.915 --> 35:20.452
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this, Commander.

35:22.388 --> 35:23.589
What's with the Olsen Twins?

35:23.622 --> 35:25.357
They're here to escort
the accused to Quantico.

35:25.391 --> 35:26.725
Well, it's about time.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.594
We'll deliver him.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.128
You've got two days
to do that.

35:39.638 --> 35:40.706
GIBBS:
Right on time,
Commander.

35:40.739 --> 35:41.873
I'm on time?!

35:43.309 --> 35:44.142
You're the one who failed

35:44.176 --> 35:45.677
to deliver the accused
to me at 0800.

35:45.711 --> 35:46.778
I found a witness.

35:46.812 --> 35:47.746
Witness to what?

35:47.779 --> 35:49.815
What happened the night
Corporal Kean died.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.184
McGEE:
You-You couldn't have!

35:52.218 --> 35:53.285
I-I-I mean...

35:53.319 --> 35:56.388
you could've, obviously,
you did-- did I miss someone

35:56.422 --> 35:57.389
in his unit?!

35:57.423 --> 35:58.957
No. All Marines
are deceased.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.526
They look alive.

36:00.559 --> 36:01.893
Gibbs...

36:01.927 --> 36:03.895
Commander, there were more
than Marines on Iwo Jima.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.764
There were more than 20,000
Japanese.

36:05.797 --> 36:06.865
They were all killed.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.367
Not all.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.868
A few were taken prisoner.

36:09.901 --> 36:10.969
Some never returned
to Japan.

36:11.002 --> 36:15.341
You found a Japanese soldier
who fought on Iwo Jima.

36:15.374 --> 36:16.742
A Japanese lieutenant.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.211
Right here in this
district, as it
so happens.

36:19.245 --> 36:20.612
As it so happens.
Yes.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.348
And where is this
miraculous find?

36:22.381 --> 36:23.815
Well, he went to the bathroom
on the way in.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.485
He should be here any...

36:26.518 --> 36:28.687
Lieutenant Commander
Coleman.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.522
Toshi Yoshida.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.624
Former lieutenant,
Japanese

36:32.658 --> 36:34.660
Imperial Army.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.328
You were in the Imperial Army,
Lieutenant?

36:36.362 --> 36:40.832
( heavy accent ):
Army... emperor... lieutenant.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.502
Taken prisoner by Marines
on Iwo Jima.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.305
Marine.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.308
Two...

36:49.341 --> 36:51.777
English isn't his thing.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.546
Gibbs...

36:54.580 --> 36:56.482
I don't know what
you're trying to do.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.884
Trying to get to
the truth, Faith.

37:11.297 --> 37:13.399
You're only delaying
the inevitable.

37:13.432 --> 37:16.802
All we have to lose
is a little time.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.670
( sighs )

37:18.704 --> 37:20.572
Okay.

37:20.606 --> 37:23.275
I will give you
a little time.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.919
What's Gibbs doing?

37:33.952 --> 37:37.789
He's creating the smell
of sulfur.

37:39.325 --> 37:40.659
Corporal Yost...

37:40.692 --> 37:42.461
Sir.

37:42.494 --> 37:46.398
Iwo Jima...

37:46.432 --> 37:48.400
Hill 382...

37:48.434 --> 37:51.870
the Meat Grinder.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.339
Start the tape.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.848
NARRATOR:
500 landing craft, in waves,

38:02.881 --> 38:04.883
lands on 3,000 yards of beach.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.790
Night patrol...

38:11.823 --> 38:14.693
probing Japanese lines.

38:14.726 --> 38:20.466
You... Private Stearns...
Private Bellows...

38:20.499 --> 38:24.736
Private Morris...

38:24.770 --> 38:26.572
Corporal Kean.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.039
( sound of explosion
on tape )

38:34.646 --> 38:36.548
I killed him.

38:36.582 --> 38:39.885
He stepped on a mine.

38:39.918 --> 38:42.688
Blew his legs off.

38:42.721 --> 38:46.091
But I killed him.

38:56.067 --> 39:01.473
( speaking Japanese )

39:14.986 --> 39:18.089
( explosions and gunfire
thundering )

39:18.123 --> 39:19.991
( men yelling )

39:20.025 --> 39:22.928
( Kean moaning )

39:22.961 --> 39:25.597
You got to be quiet, Wade.
Come on.

39:25.631 --> 39:28.099
( screaming, crying )

39:28.133 --> 39:29.501
Suck it up, Wade. Try!

39:29.535 --> 39:31.837
I can't!
Shut him up!

39:34.706 --> 39:35.607
Wade! Shh!

39:35.641 --> 39:37.108
( speaks Japanese )

39:37.142 --> 39:38.677
Ernie, do something!

39:38.710 --> 39:39.445
Shh...

39:40.779 --> 39:43.081
( speaks Japanese )

39:43.114 --> 39:44.983
Shh, shh...

39:45.016 --> 39:45.984
Shh, shh!

39:46.017 --> 39:46.918
Ernie, Ernie, shut him up!

39:46.952 --> 39:48.820
( Kean groaning )
Shut him up!

39:50.121 --> 39:53.091
Shut him up, Ernie!
Make him stop!

39:54.726 --> 39:56.595
Shut up, buddy.
( heavy blow lands )

40:01.967 --> 40:04.870
( soldiers speaking Japanese )

40:09.608 --> 40:12.878
( gasping )

40:14.012 --> 40:16.114
S... Sorry, Wade.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.753
( voice breaking ):
I'm sorry.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.471
( over speaker ):
I'm sorry.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.745
Well?

40:46.778 --> 40:49.080
( crying )

40:49.114 --> 40:51.883
I will inform the SECNAV

40:51.917 --> 40:53.952
that former Marine corporal
Ernest Yost

40:53.985 --> 40:56.622
is suffering from
delayed stress syndrome.

40:58.123 --> 41:01.026
Corporal Kean was killed
in action...

41:01.059 --> 41:02.661
not by Yost.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.530
( crying quietly )

41:08.600 --> 41:10.035
You're not going
to arrest me, either.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.771
Nope. You struck

41:12.804 --> 41:14.840
Corporal Kean to quiet
him, not to kill him.

41:14.873 --> 41:17.208
You had no choice.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.744
He stopped.

41:18.777 --> 41:21.747
But how... how will I be sure?

41:21.780 --> 41:23.682
Tell me that, Gibbs.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.083
How can I ever be sure?

41:28.820 --> 41:29.655
You met Dorothy in Hawaii,

41:29.688 --> 41:32.858
after you were wounded
on Guadalcanal?

41:32.891 --> 41:34.526
Yeah. She was a Navy nurse.

41:34.560 --> 41:35.794
You decided
to get married

41:35.827 --> 41:38.063
before you shipped off
to Iwo?

41:38.096 --> 41:41.667
Well, I told you,
it was love at first sight.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.202
We were gonna get hitched
when one of us was discharged.

41:45.203 --> 41:47.105
Who was going to be
your best man?

41:47.138 --> 41:49.140
It was going to be Wade.
He was...

41:53.879 --> 41:55.547
I asked Wade.

41:55.581 --> 41:59.184
He wasn't going
to marry Dorothy.
He said,

41:59.217 --> 42:03.021
"No hard feelings."

42:03.054 --> 42:05.056
He said we were meant
for each other.

42:06.858 --> 42:10.662
Ernie, you did what you did
to save the rest of your patrol.

42:10.696 --> 42:13.799
No other reason.

42:20.205 --> 42:22.173
Come on, Corporal.

42:22.207 --> 42:23.675
Let a gunny buy you dinner.

42:23.709 --> 42:25.877
You were never an officer?

42:25.911 --> 42:28.146
Oh, hell, no.

42:28.179 --> 42:30.716
I knew there was
something about
you I liked.

42:33.619 --> 42:34.820
Semper fi!

42:34.853 --> 42:36.054
Semper fi.

42:39.257 --> 42:42.193
( coughs )

42:42.227 --> 42:43.328
Sail again?

42:43.361 --> 42:45.330
Yeah. Why not?

42:45.363 --> 42:47.198
( speaks Japanese )

42:47.232 --> 42:49.234
( man speaks Japanese
in response )

42:57.008 --> 42:58.710
Arigato.

43:00.646 --> 43:02.180
You conned me, gunny.

43:02.213 --> 43:04.983
Nah.
Would I do that to you?

43:05.016 --> 43:06.351
You're damn right,
you would.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.790
And I want to thank you for it.

43:15.193 --> 43:17.929
And you were never on Iwo Jima.

43:19.264 --> 43:21.066
Iwo Jima, no.

43:21.099 --> 43:22.801
Ah.

43:22.834 --> 43:25.804
Guadalcanal.
