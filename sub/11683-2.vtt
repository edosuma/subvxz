00:00.456 --> 00:03.195
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.496 --> 00:05.996
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.566 --> 00:09.834
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.901 --> 00:12.103
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.171 --> 00:14.506
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.574 --> 00:16.408
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.476 --> 00:19.211
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.279 --> 00:21.280
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.316 --> 00:23.783
<i>A trigger-happy girlfriend...</i>

00:23.851 --> 00:25.418
Should we shoot them?

00:25.486 --> 00:27.219
<i>...an old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:27.287 --> 00:29.988
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.056 --> 00:32.357
<i>...family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.424 --> 00:34.292
<i>...if you're desperate....</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:34.360 --> 00:37.428
<i>...and a down-and-out spy</i>
<i>you met along the way.</i>

00:37.496 --> 00:39.063
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.131 --> 00:41.732
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:41.799 --> 00:43.600
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:49.339 --> 00:52.809
<i>"Dear Michael, I don't know</i>
<i>if this letter will reach you,</i>

00:52.876 --> 00:54.377
<i>"but the thought that it might</i>

00:54.445 --> 00:56.180
<i>"is a small comfort</i>
<i>in this place,</i>

00:56.248 --> 00:58.483
<i>"where even the smallest</i>
<i>comfort is something.</i>

00:58.551 --> 01:01.085
<i>"It seems likely</i>
<i>it will be my home from now on,</i>

01:01.153 --> 01:03.387
<i>"until I'm officially tried.</i>

01:03.455 --> 01:06.089
<i>"They're holding me at</i>
<i>Allarod Federal Penitentiary,</i>

01:06.157 --> 01:09.059
<i>"a maximum-security facility</i>
<i>for, as they like to say,</i>

01:09.127 --> 01:11.395
<i>"'the worst of the worst.'</i>

01:11.463 --> 01:13.196
<i>"My trial is still</i>
<i>some months away,</i>

01:13.264 --> 01:15.299
<i>"but my lawyer tells me</i>
<i>that my confession</i>

01:15.366 --> 01:18.603
<i>"makes a legal defense...</i>
<i>a challenge.</i>

01:18.671 --> 01:20.872
<i>"I told her</i>
<i>not to waste her time.</i>

01:20.940 --> 01:22.307
<i>"The worst part, really,</i>

01:22.374 --> 01:24.375
<i>"is what they make you give up</i>
<i>in here.</i>

01:24.443 --> 01:26.678
<i>"It's not just your freedom.</i>

01:26.745 --> 01:29.981
<i>"They take your dignity,</i>
<i>your hope...</i>

01:30.048 --> 01:33.951
<i>"so you give up</i>
<i>and do as you're told.</i>

01:34.018 --> 01:37.220
<i>"And you know how good I am</i>
<i>at doing what I'm told.</i>

01:37.288 --> 01:39.622
<i>"For the most part,</i>
<i>I'm just another prisoner.</i>

01:39.690 --> 01:41.857
<i>"I don't expect to make</i>
<i>many friends here,</i>

01:41.925 --> 01:44.626
<i>but, then, I've never made</i>
<i>friends easily, anyway."</i>

01:47.316 --> 01:50.852
<i>"At least I have</i>
<i>a little privacy.</i>

01:50.920 --> 01:53.355
<i>"When I'm not in the yard,</i>
<i>at meals, or on work duty,</i>

01:53.423 --> 01:58.628
<i>"I'm housed in a unit</i>
<i>for violent offenders...alone.</i>

01:58.695 --> 02:00.963
<i>"It reminds me</i>
<i>of the first time</i>

02:01.031 --> 02:03.032
<i>"that I lost you in Ireland.</i>

02:03.100 --> 02:08.205
<i>"I'd see you in my dreams,</i>
<i>but I'd wake up...</i>

02:08.271 --> 02:10.806
<i>"and you were still gone.</i>

02:10.875 --> 02:15.379
<i>"The dreams hurt, but they were</i>
<i>all that kept me going.</i>

02:15.447 --> 02:19.684
<i>"They did then...</i>
<i>and they do now.</i>

02:19.752 --> 02:21.753
<i>Love, Fi."</i>

02:24.050 --> 02:25.350
You all right, brother?

02:25.418 --> 02:28.320
She's close to giving up.

02:33.292 --> 02:35.827
I need to see her, Sam.

02:35.895 --> 02:37.295
She has to know
we're trying to get her out.

02:37.363 --> 02:39.898
I'm afraid you can't, Mike.
She's too high a risk.

02:39.965 --> 02:42.200
Look, I had to pull strings at
Homeland Security just to get that letter.

02:42.268 --> 02:43.735
So seeing her? Forget it.

02:45.237 --> 02:47.305
Now, come on.

02:47.372 --> 02:50.008
Before you wreck
a perfectly good table,

02:50.075 --> 02:52.977
you should get talking
with your pals at the CIA

02:53.045 --> 02:54.312
and get some help.

02:54.380 --> 02:56.215
I already talked to Pearce.
She tried.

02:56.283 --> 02:57.249
No one's touching this.

02:57.317 --> 03:00.619
You know, Mike, uh,

03:00.687 --> 03:03.188
you used to have friends
in high places at the Agency.

03:03.256 --> 03:04.923
I know they turned
their backs on you

03:04.991 --> 03:06.258
when you got burned,
but...

03:06.326 --> 03:07.659
Why would they help me now?

03:07.727 --> 03:09.094
Maybe if you give them
a reason to.

03:10.931 --> 03:13.733
<i>There are certain people</i>
<i>in life you get stuck with,</i>

03:13.801 --> 03:16.937
<i>whether you love them,</i>
<i>they drive you nuts, or both.</i>

03:17.004 --> 03:18.739
<i>They've made you who you are.</i>

03:18.806 --> 03:21.742
<i>For most people, it's a coach</i>
<i>or a favorite teacher.</i>

03:21.810 --> 03:24.445
<i>For a spy,</i>
<i>it's his training officer.</i>

03:24.513 --> 03:25.346
Michael.

03:27.983 --> 03:29.750
Tom.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.385
How long's it been?
Eight years?

03:31.453 --> 03:33.320
Something like that.

03:34.522 --> 03:35.522
Sit, please.

03:37.525 --> 03:40.360
There's no need
to pretend for me.

03:40.427 --> 03:42.161
I, um --
good.

03:42.229 --> 03:44.263
You have every reason
in the world to hate my guts.

03:44.331 --> 03:46.432
I wasn't exactly great
at returning calls when you,

03:46.500 --> 03:48.534
um...well, you know.

03:48.602 --> 03:50.569
It was nothing personal.

03:50.637 --> 03:54.440
There simply wasn't anything
I could do to help you.

03:54.508 --> 03:55.475
You can make it up
to me now.

03:55.543 --> 03:56.643
I need to see
Fiona Glenanne.

03:56.711 --> 03:58.445
This is all about
your girlfriend?

03:58.513 --> 04:00.614
Yeah, I heard about
that situation.

04:00.682 --> 04:02.450
Trust me -- she's innocent.

04:02.518 --> 04:07.189
Look...just do yourself
a favor...

04:07.256 --> 04:09.191
and walk away.

04:09.259 --> 04:11.460
Not with this, I can't.
You have to.

04:11.527 --> 04:14.096
Your status at the Agency
is not exactly helped

04:14.163 --> 04:16.365
by your association
with her.

04:16.432 --> 04:18.901
You are just back in.

04:18.969 --> 04:21.470
Card, I know you've been moved
from training to operations,

04:21.538 --> 04:23.472
so if I have to earn
some points around here

04:23.540 --> 04:25.408
to make this happen,
just give me a job.

04:25.476 --> 04:28.745
You want a job...
with me?

04:31.282 --> 04:33.783
You're serious?

04:36.554 --> 04:37.587
Come on.

04:37.655 --> 04:39.256
I will do
whatever it takes, Card.

04:39.323 --> 04:40.657
Now, you owe me
at least that.

04:40.725 --> 04:42.693
I was your star pupil.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.263
Hell, you're sitting
in that chair because of me.

04:48.733 --> 04:51.401
I can't even believe
I'm doing this.

04:53.438 --> 04:55.672
Okay.

04:55.740 --> 04:57.173
Fine.

04:57.241 --> 04:59.676
There is...something.

04:59.744 --> 05:01.011
I wasn't gonna do it

05:01.079 --> 05:03.246
because I didn't have
an operative in Miami.

05:03.314 --> 05:04.681
I guess I do now.

05:04.749 --> 05:07.718
Michael, let's be real clear
about this right up front.

05:07.785 --> 05:09.119
If you screw this up,

05:09.187 --> 05:12.790
there is not going to be
any lifeline, no safety net.

05:12.858 --> 05:15.626
It's just going to be
you and me

05:15.694 --> 05:19.363
with our asses
flapping in the wind.

05:19.431 --> 05:21.815
And exactly how
does that sound to you?

05:21.840 --> 05:24.170
That sounds like
a risk I'm willing to take.

05:31.935 --> 05:33.703
We have
your table ready, Mr. Card.

05:33.770 --> 05:36.039
John, how are you?

05:36.107 --> 05:37.407
Seems like old times,
huh?

05:37.475 --> 05:39.442
If by "old times,"
you mean running me through

05:39.510 --> 05:41.812
counter-interrogation exercises
on one hour of sleep.

05:41.879 --> 05:44.147
Oh, cry me a river, Michael.
I wasn't that bad on you.

05:44.215 --> 05:45.682
The old Card never
would have treated me

05:45.750 --> 05:47.184
to a five-star meal.

05:47.251 --> 05:50.019
Who said the new Card was?

05:50.087 --> 05:51.154
Whiskey neat.

05:51.221 --> 05:52.622
And an iced tea
for my friend.

05:52.690 --> 05:54.491
That is still your drink
of choice, yes?

05:54.558 --> 05:56.825
Nothing gets by you,
Card -- nothing.

05:56.893 --> 05:57.860
Cheers.

06:00.063 --> 06:01.196
It's funny.

06:01.264 --> 06:02.665
What?

06:02.733 --> 06:06.435
Me being the one
to help you see Fiona.

06:06.502 --> 06:08.904
Why? Because you never liked her?
I liked her fine.

06:08.971 --> 06:10.372
I didn't like my protégé

06:10.440 --> 06:12.441
sleeping with
a foreign arms trader

06:12.509 --> 06:13.976
he met under a cover I.D.

06:14.043 --> 06:16.244
That sort of thing can make
your training officer look bad.

06:16.312 --> 06:17.946
You said
she would ruin my life.

06:18.014 --> 06:19.982
I was just calling it
the way I saw it.

06:20.050 --> 06:22.618
In my defense,
I didn't know so many people

06:22.686 --> 06:25.154
would be lining up
to ruin your life anyway.

06:26.990 --> 06:28.390
So, what's the job
you need me for?

06:28.458 --> 06:32.728
I have spent most
of the last year down in Mexico

06:32.795 --> 06:35.196
in a joint CIA-DEA
task force

06:35.264 --> 06:36.998
focused on
the Zetas Cartel --

06:37.066 --> 06:39.200
1,000 man-hours.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.536
We have exactly squat
to show for it.

06:41.603 --> 06:42.703
Where in Mexico?

06:42.771 --> 06:45.172
No need
to even pack your bags.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.674
Cartel is trying to establish
a foothold in Miami.

06:47.742 --> 06:49.910
We need
to shut them down there.

06:49.978 --> 06:54.749
Right now, we are focused on
two Mexican nationals.

06:54.816 --> 06:57.051
Ramiro Salazar is the boss.

06:57.119 --> 06:59.554
He's not gonna get my vote
for grandfather of the year.

06:59.621 --> 07:00.922
He's not even
the real problem.

07:00.989 --> 07:03.625
That title belongs
to Rafael Montero.

07:03.692 --> 07:05.794
He's linked
to 10 homicides.

07:05.861 --> 07:06.995
He's totally paranoid.

07:07.063 --> 07:09.064
Every time I get somebody
close to him,

07:09.131 --> 07:11.700
they wind up dead, chopped up
in about a hundred little pieces.

07:11.767 --> 07:13.836
I assume you have a plan.

07:13.903 --> 07:15.971
We caught a break in
an operation out of Veracruz,

07:16.039 --> 07:18.174
found out that 2 tons of cocaine
are coming into Miami

07:18.241 --> 07:20.076
in the next 48 hours.

07:20.144 --> 07:23.346
We need to figure out
where that shipment is landing.

07:23.414 --> 07:24.581
I'm in.

07:34.757 --> 07:35.690
Who is it?

07:35.757 --> 07:37.024
Your mother.

07:37.092 --> 07:38.592
And me, bro.

07:39.828 --> 07:41.495
Nate,
what are you doing here?

07:41.562 --> 07:44.564
Well, I guess I could ask you
the same question.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.166
Where's Ruth
and the baby?

07:46.234 --> 07:47.467
Back in Vegas.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.702
Look, I heard
what went down around here.

07:48.770 --> 07:50.137
I figured you could use
some support.

07:50.205 --> 07:51.706
I'm gonna be staying
for a while.

07:51.773 --> 07:53.675
You don't need
to do that.

07:53.742 --> 07:55.410
Look, uh, Michael,
the reason that I, uh,

07:55.478 --> 07:57.045
dragged Nate over here
is I thought

07:57.113 --> 07:58.848
it would be nice
if the two of you talked

07:58.915 --> 08:00.716
about, you know,
things.

08:01.952 --> 08:03.252
'Cause God knows
you never talk to me.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.787
I just can't do this
right now.

08:04.855 --> 08:07.823
I have an assignment that may
help me get to see Fiona.

08:07.891 --> 08:10.125
Okay, okay. Not now.
I get it.

08:10.193 --> 08:12.527
Mom, just not right now,
all right?

08:12.595 --> 08:14.429
Take care,
you and Fiona both.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.272
<i>Going to prison is always</i>
<i>a possibility for an operative.</i>

08:26.340 --> 08:29.610
<i>When your job involves</i>
<i>working outside the law,</i>

08:29.677 --> 08:31.278
<i>sometimes it can't be avoided.</i>

08:31.346 --> 08:33.481
<i>If you find yourself inside,</i>

08:33.549 --> 08:36.150
<i>the first thing to remember</i>
<i>is patience.</i>

08:36.217 --> 08:39.888
<i>You have to take your time,</i>
<i>figure out who the players are,</i>

08:39.956 --> 08:43.225
<i>and stay out of trouble</i>
<i>as long as you can...</i>

08:43.293 --> 08:46.028
<i>because, inevitably,</i>
<i>trouble will come to you.</i>

08:59.942 --> 09:01.408
No need
to eat off the floor.

09:01.476 --> 09:03.043
Here.

09:16.624 --> 09:19.926
Welcome to Allarod
Federal pen.

09:28.402 --> 09:31.203
There's a spot over here
if you want it.

09:36.408 --> 09:38.643
You know, I'd think twice
before eating that.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.582
D.B. Thinks she's, uh,
queen of the cellblock.

09:44.649 --> 09:46.817
She does this
to every single new girl.

09:50.255 --> 09:52.290
All right,
so, here's the deal.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.259
Every-- everyone's looking
at you right now.

09:54.327 --> 09:57.597
And if, uh,
you don't eat her little gift,

09:57.664 --> 09:59.566
you're spitting
in her face.

09:59.634 --> 10:01.501
She's your enemy.

10:01.569 --> 10:03.069
And if I do?

10:03.137 --> 10:05.038
Then she owns you.

10:05.106 --> 10:07.141
See, I made that mistake
when I first got here.

10:07.208 --> 10:08.675
I took her little gift
and, you know,

10:08.743 --> 10:09.910
kind of got a little tired

10:09.978 --> 10:11.679
of her telling me
what to do all the time.

10:11.746 --> 10:13.580
So she gave me
another little gift --

10:13.648 --> 10:15.215
a scar to remember her by.

10:19.954 --> 10:22.723
Thanks for the tip.

10:22.791 --> 10:25.059
I never did care much
for apples.

10:32.667 --> 10:34.601
Man, these guys
are hardcore.

10:34.669 --> 10:36.136
Is that
a problem there, champ?

10:36.204 --> 10:37.705
Because Michael led me
to believe

10:37.772 --> 10:39.439
that you had experience
with cartels.

10:39.507 --> 10:41.575
Oh, I do. I just don't usually
spend my vacation days

10:41.643 --> 10:44.111
going after guys that feed
their enemies to alligators.

10:44.179 --> 10:45.479
All right, then,
let's get down to business.

10:58.159 --> 11:01.195
You must be Card.

11:01.262 --> 11:02.596
Sam Axe.

11:02.664 --> 11:04.431
I'm sorry -- is that
what I think it is?

11:04.499 --> 11:07.634
Yep. Welcome to my
least favorite job ever.

11:07.702 --> 11:09.002
Okay,
what's with the corpse?

11:09.070 --> 11:10.671
It's part of our cover I.D.
with Montero.

11:10.738 --> 11:13.873
You two will approach
as DEA agents

11:13.941 --> 11:16.208
Alex Russel
and Ben Osborne.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.778
You will tell them that
you are skimming Agency funds.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.080
Your boss found out --
you shot him.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.182
Our boss being that dead guy?
Yes.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.218
Might seem like a bit much,
but without that dead body,

11:26.285 --> 11:28.320
Montero's not gonna buy
your story.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.290
Where'd we get
the dead guy?

11:30.358 --> 11:31.892
Oh, he's a gunshot victim,

11:31.959 --> 11:33.994
courtesy
of the coroner's office.

11:36.264 --> 11:39.000
I'll go
get the guy ready.

11:39.068 --> 11:41.269
The idea being
you went to gun him down,

11:41.337 --> 11:43.872
and you stumbled across an op
that he was running

11:43.940 --> 11:45.340
against the cartels.

11:45.408 --> 11:47.275
We scare Montero
into moving his shipment

11:47.343 --> 11:48.610
someplace we can bust it.

11:48.677 --> 11:50.611
All right,
listen to me carefully.

11:50.679 --> 11:52.079
You got to have
each other's backs.

11:52.147 --> 11:54.047
If Montero even
looks at you sideways,

11:54.115 --> 11:55.549
you pull out, you get it?

11:55.616 --> 11:57.150
When you go in, you're gonna be
mostly by yourselves.

11:57.218 --> 12:00.120
You'll have each other
and this bug.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.488
Click the top of that pen,
you're transmitting.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.057
It'll make it through most scans
and has a range of 3 miles.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.227
Michael, Michael...
please don't break it.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.630
Red tape is brutal
at the Agency these days.

12:10.697 --> 12:11.998
I'll guard it with my life.

12:12.065 --> 12:12.899
Thataboy.

12:26.715 --> 12:28.348
What the hell is this?

12:28.416 --> 12:30.684
Surveillance,
Miami style.

12:30.752 --> 12:33.387
I mean, you can't park
a block away from Diego's

12:33.455 --> 12:36.156
and not get the best cafécitos
in town.

12:36.224 --> 12:39.326
What? I figured mojitos
were out of the question.

12:39.394 --> 12:40.861
Is Mike's bug live?

12:40.929 --> 12:42.596
No. Doesn't go live
till he approaches Montero.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.837
Think Montero's gonna be
hard to spot?

12:58.847 --> 13:00.414
Ooh.

13:13.262 --> 13:15.296
Jesse, wait up.

13:17.399 --> 13:20.000
We've got a problem.

13:20.068 --> 13:21.235
I miss something?

13:21.303 --> 13:23.137
The man with Montero
knows me.

13:23.205 --> 13:25.506
His name is Gellman.
He's a drug lawyer.

13:25.574 --> 13:26.807
I met him on another job.

13:26.875 --> 13:28.542
"Met" as in...

13:28.610 --> 13:32.380
Let's just say he lost one of his clients
permanently because of me.

13:32.448 --> 13:34.348
I'm calling this off.
Calling it off? Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:34.416 --> 13:35.716
Mike, he knows you.
He doesn't know me.

13:35.784 --> 13:37.285
Just give me the bug.
I'll make the approach.

13:37.353 --> 13:39.120
The whole point of this
is it's a two-man job.

13:39.187 --> 13:40.822
No, the whole point is this
is your one chance to see Fi.

13:40.889 --> 13:43.958
I can't let you do this.
Mike...I'm doing this.

13:44.026 --> 13:45.092
Jesse.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.594
Fi's my friend, too.
I want to help.

13:46.662 --> 13:49.898
Just get out of here before
you get spotted. Come on.

13:49.966 --> 13:51.132
Just go.
I got this, man.

13:55.871 --> 13:57.572
Oh, no,
what the hell is going on?

13:57.639 --> 13:59.440
You're supposed to be
up with Jesse.

13:59.508 --> 14:02.310
Change of plans.
Let me see if I've got this straight.

14:02.378 --> 14:05.447
So, you left Jesse
up there all by himself.

14:05.514 --> 14:07.782
Do you know
how dangerous Montero is?

14:07.850 --> 14:09.651
I would have blown my cover.
I didn't have a choice.

14:09.719 --> 14:11.219
Sure you did.

14:11.287 --> 14:12.821
You could have called it off,
like you were trained to do,

14:12.888 --> 14:14.322
like you were ordered to do.

14:15.391 --> 14:16.491
What do you think
you're doing?

14:16.558 --> 14:17.959
What does it look like
I'm doing?

14:18.026 --> 14:19.060
Playing tiddledywinks?

14:19.127 --> 14:20.928
I'm going
to extract your buddy.

14:20.995 --> 14:22.663
This is over.

14:22.730 --> 14:25.232
We had exactly one chance
to get these guys.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.634
Maybe we could have regrouped
if you and Porter had aborted,

14:27.702 --> 14:28.768
but you didn't.

14:28.836 --> 14:30.037
So, here's a suggestion.

14:30.104 --> 14:31.739
Here's a suggestion!

14:31.807 --> 14:32.774
Suit up!

14:32.841 --> 14:34.276
No.

14:34.343 --> 14:38.781
At this point, Michael,
you're not thinking clearly.

14:38.848 --> 14:40.282
You're distracted.

14:40.350 --> 14:41.884
You're desperate to get
your girlfriend out of prison.

14:41.952 --> 14:43.853
But here's
the bottom line.

14:43.921 --> 14:47.457
You just put my mission
and your pal's life on the line.

14:47.525 --> 14:48.591
Let me tell you
something, Card.

14:48.659 --> 14:50.460
You need a win -- badly.

14:50.528 --> 14:52.996
You wouldn't have let me
anywhere near this op if you didn't.

14:53.063 --> 14:55.131
Now, you trained me.
You know me.

14:55.199 --> 14:57.934
I'm the same operative
as I was before.

14:58.002 --> 14:59.436
You let me
see this through.

14:59.504 --> 15:01.337
The bug is live.
I'm about to go in.

15:01.405 --> 15:03.706
Guys, we got a man wading
into deep water out there,

15:03.774 --> 15:07.610
so we got to fish or cut bait,
but we got to decide now.

15:07.678 --> 15:09.779
Fine.

15:09.847 --> 15:12.549
Let's go ahead and see
if you can still run an op.

15:14.451 --> 15:15.952
Get away, girls.

15:19.957 --> 15:23.225
All right. Okay.

15:23.293 --> 15:26.862
Agent Russel, my client's
got nothing to say to you.

15:26.930 --> 15:28.730
And if you want
to contact my client,

15:28.798 --> 15:31.299
you're gonna do it through me
in the appropriate manner,

15:31.367 --> 15:32.366
through the --

15:32.434 --> 15:34.602
Oh, official channels,
all that.

15:34.670 --> 15:37.405
I got it. I respect it.
Plug your ears, hmm?

15:39.775 --> 15:41.675
I have access
to a DEA safe house

15:41.743 --> 15:44.278
filled with information
about an investigation

15:44.346 --> 15:46.447
into your client and his friends
in Los Zetas.

15:46.515 --> 15:49.751
Now, I would be willing
to arrange for your client

15:49.818 --> 15:52.953
to visit this safe house
for a reasonable price.

15:53.021 --> 15:55.556
Stop.
Stop right there.

15:55.624 --> 15:59.094
Mr. Montero, as your lawyer,
I shouldn't be hearing this,

15:59.161 --> 16:02.998
but I strongly advise
you finish your lunch.

16:05.102 --> 16:07.102
Okay.

16:07.170 --> 16:11.307
Anyway, due to circumstances
that I'd rather not get into,

16:11.375 --> 16:15.778
I have to torch said safe house
within the next --

16:15.846 --> 16:17.814
oh, I don't know --
12 hours.

16:17.882 --> 16:20.049
You really want to check it out
before that happens.

16:20.117 --> 16:23.986
Mm. And how would I repay
your kindness?

16:24.054 --> 16:25.354
I'm glad you asked.

16:25.422 --> 16:27.556
If you like what you see,
which I know that you will,

16:27.624 --> 16:30.359
you put me
on the payroll, hmm?

16:30.427 --> 16:31.827
I'd be, like,
your guy in the DEA.

16:31.895 --> 16:35.332
Oh, sorry, I'm not hiring.
I got all the guys I need.

16:35.399 --> 16:36.767
Oh.

16:36.834 --> 16:40.237
Well, I suggest
that you create a new opening.

16:42.674 --> 16:46.511
You don't walk away,
I'll create a big opening.

16:46.578 --> 16:48.145
One push of this,

16:48.213 --> 16:51.115
and you're bloodier
than my steak.

16:51.182 --> 16:54.918
Okay. I take it
that you're not interested.

16:54.986 --> 16:57.688
I'm gonna keep it moving.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.824
Well, um, your loss.

17:00.892 --> 17:03.260
And when you lose the 2 tons
of coke coming up from Veracruz,

17:03.327 --> 17:05.829
don't say I didn't warn you.
<i>Adios, amigo.</i>

17:05.896 --> 17:07.731
Wait. What?

17:07.799 --> 17:09.566
What do you think
I've been talking about?

17:09.634 --> 17:11.202
Your shipment's
about to get busted.

17:11.269 --> 17:12.569
That's what
I'm selling here --

17:12.637 --> 17:14.405
a chance for you to save
your new franchise in Miami.

17:15.641 --> 17:16.607
Oh.

17:16.675 --> 17:18.175
Hmm?

17:21.313 --> 17:23.814
You're one hell of a salesman.
Oh, thank you.

17:23.882 --> 17:26.049
Let's go see this place.

17:31.790 --> 17:33.791
What'd I say?

17:35.127 --> 17:37.862
Look at all this.
Do you recognize that guy?

17:37.929 --> 17:40.564
Is it me, or does someone have
a secret admirer?

17:43.201 --> 17:45.502
Operation Frostbite?

17:45.570 --> 17:47.271
Yeah, it's the code name
for the op.

17:47.339 --> 17:50.607
"Request for SWAT approved
for location zebra,

17:50.675 --> 17:52.076
3/16, 1900 hours?"
Yep.

17:52.143 --> 17:53.777
That's the code for,
"they're about to bust the hell

17:53.845 --> 17:55.246
out of your shipment."

17:55.314 --> 17:57.248
How do they know
about this?! Huh?!

17:59.618 --> 18:00.685
Hey. Okay, hey.

18:00.753 --> 18:02.621
Who's in charge
of this place?!

18:02.688 --> 18:03.889
Mr. Montero,
as I mentioned,

18:03.957 --> 18:05.391
I don't want to get
into the details, okay?

18:05.458 --> 18:08.194
Enough games.
Okay?

18:08.261 --> 18:09.395
You trying to play me?!

18:09.462 --> 18:10.896
Are you trying to play me?!

18:10.963 --> 18:13.665
If you don't tell me
what I want to know,

18:13.733 --> 18:16.568
I'm gonna take this knife
and I'm gonna gut you

18:16.636 --> 18:18.337
right here where you stand.

18:18.404 --> 18:20.405
It's my boss.
It's my boss's op.

18:20.473 --> 18:21.740
Where is he?!

18:21.808 --> 18:25.210
I was skimming cash.
He found out. I -- I...

18:25.278 --> 18:29.648
I-I kind of accidentally
discharged my weapon

18:29.716 --> 18:33.619
into his body...
four times.

18:38.591 --> 18:42.327
He kind of accidentally
shot his boss four times.

18:42.395 --> 18:44.129
I love it!

18:44.196 --> 18:46.264
I stashed the body, I came straight
to you, man. Hand to God.

18:46.332 --> 18:48.165
You stashed the body?

18:48.233 --> 18:49.033
Where?

18:54.206 --> 18:55.707
Oh.

18:55.774 --> 18:58.309
♪ Bunh-buh-dum ♪

19:08.419 --> 19:10.853
That's a year's worth
of bacon.

19:10.921 --> 19:13.823
Yeah, it's good old Zack --
Zack Simon.

19:13.890 --> 19:17.025
He ran the task force
assigned to you guys.

19:18.594 --> 19:20.095
Nice piece of shooting.

19:20.162 --> 19:21.830
Guess I have a knack
for it.

19:21.897 --> 19:24.800
Knack for it?

19:24.867 --> 19:27.036
I like you!
Yeah.

19:27.104 --> 19:28.538
Get him
to move the shipment.

19:28.605 --> 19:30.707
When he doesn't check in,
he's gonna be missed.

19:30.775 --> 19:33.010
Okay? Which means you guys
got to redirect your shipment,

19:33.077 --> 19:35.245
like, now.

19:35.313 --> 19:37.481
There's actually a spot
in Dadeland Cove

19:37.549 --> 19:38.882
that would be perfect.

19:38.950 --> 19:42.086
The local P.D. --
they got a beef with the DEA,

19:42.154 --> 19:44.289
so they don't -- don't let them
operate in the area.

19:44.356 --> 19:45.423
Dadeland Cove, huh?

19:45.491 --> 19:47.258
Yeah, safest place
in Miami, man.

19:49.061 --> 19:50.661
I'll think about it.

19:50.729 --> 19:53.064
In the meantime, we need
to go talk to somebody.

19:53.131 --> 19:55.065
Let's go take a ride.
Yeah.

19:56.501 --> 19:57.967
Bingo.
Montero took the bait.

19:58.035 --> 19:59.369
Probably taking Jesse

19:59.436 --> 20:01.370
to get the official okay
to move the shipment.

20:04.140 --> 20:06.275
Okay, it looks like
they're moving.

20:06.343 --> 20:07.543
Let's get this done.

20:09.646 --> 20:13.415
<i>Prison, or any confined</i>
<i>institutional environment,</i>

20:13.483 --> 20:17.119
<i>is just about the worst place</i>
<i>possible to make an enemy.</i>

20:17.187 --> 20:20.289
<i>The regular schedule means</i>
<i>your enemies know where you are</i>

20:20.356 --> 20:21.590
<i>every hour of the day,</i>

20:21.657 --> 20:23.759
<i>while crowded living conditions</i>

20:23.826 --> 20:25.594
<i>mean they can choose</i>
<i>the time and place</i>

20:25.661 --> 20:27.896
<i>that is best for an attack.</i>

20:27.964 --> 20:30.598
<i>Usually, the best thing</i>
<i>you can do is stay moving,</i>

20:30.666 --> 20:32.767
<i>stay aware, and stay paranoid.</i>

20:32.835 --> 20:34.469
Oh, hey.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.337
Whoa!

20:36.405 --> 20:39.273
Oh, my -- nice reflexes.
Sorry.

20:39.341 --> 20:41.442
Remind me to never
sneak up on you again.

20:41.510 --> 20:42.676
I thought
you were one of them.

20:42.744 --> 20:45.179
Man, I've been seeing them
eyeballing you.

20:45.246 --> 20:47.515
D.B.
can hold such a grudge.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.717
You know, is there any way
to get back to the cellblock

20:49.785 --> 20:51.218
without going through
my new fan club?

20:51.286 --> 20:54.989
Yeah. I mean, that's easy.
Just go and mouth off to Clyde.

20:55.057 --> 20:56.524
Yard time's almost over,

20:56.592 --> 20:58.560
so before he rounds
everybody up,

20:58.628 --> 20:59.928
go bust his chops.

20:59.996 --> 21:01.464
I mean,
you're not gonna get lunch,

21:01.531 --> 21:03.065
but it's better
than getting your ass beat.

21:03.133 --> 21:06.335
<i>Guard Jones to the east gate.</i>

21:06.403 --> 21:07.837
<i>Guard Jones to the east gate.</i>

21:23.086 --> 21:25.320
Off the wall, Glenanne!
You know the rules!

21:25.388 --> 21:26.321
Oh, I like it here.

21:27.824 --> 21:30.993
One more chance.

21:31.061 --> 21:34.598
You want to do it that way?
Fine by me.

21:34.666 --> 21:37.101
But you're not gonna last long
if you're playing those games.

21:37.168 --> 21:39.436
<i>Most survival strategies</i>
<i>in prison</i>

21:39.504 --> 21:41.338
<i>don't involve making</i>
<i>many friends.</i>

21:41.406 --> 21:43.808
Move!
<i>When it's just about staying alive,</i>

21:43.875 --> 21:46.477
<i>you do what you have to.</i>

21:54.386 --> 21:56.286
Okay, where the hell
is Montero taking Jesse?

21:56.354 --> 21:58.155
I thought
they were meeting the boss.

21:58.223 --> 21:59.456
I'm guessing that place
doesn't belong

21:59.524 --> 22:01.158
to the head of a cartel.

22:01.226 --> 22:03.427
We may have caught a break.
This could be their stash house.

22:03.495 --> 22:05.262
What are you doing here?

22:05.330 --> 22:06.530
You can't just show up here.

22:06.598 --> 22:08.032
You're right.
I could have called.

22:08.099 --> 22:09.767
But I wanted you to say
to my face

22:09.835 --> 22:11.802
why you didn't tell me
about the DEA's plan

22:11.870 --> 22:12.903
to bust my shipment.

22:12.971 --> 22:14.038
What are you
talking about?!

22:15.674 --> 22:17.508
I was at
the safe house, <i>cabrón --</i>

22:17.576 --> 22:19.644
the one with my pictures
all over the walls,

22:19.711 --> 22:23.114
with the files that the DEA has
on the investigation,

22:23.182 --> 22:25.616
the kind of information
that I pay <i>you</i> for.

22:25.684 --> 22:28.186
Uh, Mike,
this doesn't sound good.

22:28.253 --> 22:31.823
I don't know anything about
a bust or a safe house.

22:31.891 --> 22:33.691
And who's this guy?

22:35.127 --> 22:37.094
Are you kidding me?

22:37.162 --> 22:39.129
What the hell
is the matter with you?

22:39.197 --> 22:42.132
He's DEA
just like you, <i>cabrón.</i>

22:42.200 --> 22:43.400
DEA? This guy?

22:43.468 --> 22:45.402
Oh, that's just beautiful.

22:45.470 --> 22:47.438
Montero's got a DEA agent
working for him now.

22:47.506 --> 22:49.073
I've never seen him
before in my life!

22:49.141 --> 22:52.276
That's the best you can do,
Agent Kemp?

22:52.344 --> 22:53.777
You've never seen me before,
seriously?

22:53.845 --> 22:55.446
Don't you see
what's going on here?

22:55.513 --> 22:56.947
He didn't tip you
about the bust

22:57.014 --> 22:59.349
'cause he's the one that told
the DEA about the shipment.

22:59.416 --> 23:00.650
He's been playing you, man.

23:00.718 --> 23:02.618
I swear, Montero!
He's lying!

23:02.686 --> 23:04.020
Of course he's gonna say
I'm lying.

23:04.087 --> 23:05.688
What's he gonna say --
"I sold you out"? Please.

23:05.756 --> 23:07.124
I've seen better acting
in a porn film.

23:07.191 --> 23:10.461
Okay, well, we're gonna
have to sort this out,

23:10.529 --> 23:14.365
because one of you
is telling the truth...

23:14.433 --> 23:17.503
And the other
is eating a bullet.

23:19.117 --> 23:21.203
Mike we don't have a lot of time
to get Jesse out of there.

23:21.554 --> 23:23.923
Something tells me
Montero's the itchy-finger type.

23:23.955 --> 23:26.055
Card and I will take the front,
draw their fire.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.089
You go out back, you get Jesse,
wait for my signal.

23:29.156 --> 23:30.490
Montero, think about it.

23:30.558 --> 23:33.226
I told you everything I knew
about the joint task force.

23:33.294 --> 23:35.629
I mean, how many operations
did I give up, huh?

23:35.697 --> 23:36.998
How many informants?

23:37.066 --> 23:39.467
I gave you their names,
where you could find them.

23:39.535 --> 23:41.002
That's why all
our undercovers got killed.

23:42.009 --> 23:45.577
When we go in,
that son of a bitch is mine.

23:45.645 --> 23:48.046
How else
could you take them out?

23:48.114 --> 23:49.380
Makes sense, <i>cabrón.</i>

23:49.448 --> 23:51.082
Why would he turn over
all these rats for me

23:51.150 --> 23:53.617
to slice up
if he wasn't on our side?

23:53.685 --> 23:55.586
I'm starting to like his story
more than yours.

23:55.653 --> 23:57.254
Okay, hold on.
Don't do anything stupid.

23:57.321 --> 23:58.722
Stupid?
Just listen to me!

23:58.823 --> 24:00.623
Everyone,
listen to me, okay?

24:00.691 --> 24:02.158
This is all gonna
work itself out.

24:02.226 --> 24:03.426
No need to rush
into anything.

24:03.493 --> 24:04.793
Guys, guys,
hold on a second.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.762
I think
Jesse's making a play.

24:08.032 --> 24:10.667
Can you -- can we point the gun
away from my head, please?

24:13.338 --> 24:15.606
Thank you. All right.

24:15.674 --> 24:17.408
Your boy Kemp here
gave up some people

24:17.476 --> 24:19.444
that he <i>said</i> were informants.

24:19.511 --> 24:21.013
That does not mean
that they <i>were</i> informants.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.281
He gave you some names.
So what?

24:22.349 --> 24:23.916
Well, how come we didn't
get busted

24:23.984 --> 24:25.451
the whole time
I was paying him?

24:25.519 --> 24:27.620
Because
he's reeling you in.

24:27.687 --> 24:29.188
Reeling him in how?

24:29.256 --> 24:30.856
You let
the small shipments go.

24:30.924 --> 24:32.424
You nail the big ones.
That's how deep cover works.

24:32.492 --> 24:34.092
Tell him, Kemp.
Montero, he's lying.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.594
Let's just slow down,
and we'll talk about this.

24:35.661 --> 24:37.062
Oh, you'd love that,
wouldn't you?

24:37.130 --> 24:40.064
Yeah, okay, let me tell you why
he wants you to "slow down."

24:40.132 --> 24:41.232
His cover's been blown.

24:41.300 --> 24:42.633
What are you talking about?!

24:42.701 --> 24:44.935
I'm talking about
the DEA extraction team

24:45.003 --> 24:48.272
that's about to barge in here any
second, try to save your sorry ass.

24:48.340 --> 24:50.641
Now, when that happens, you'll all
know that I've been telling the truth.

24:50.709 --> 24:52.743
But it'll be too late, 'cause we'll
all be busted and on our way to prison.

24:52.811 --> 24:55.780
Thank you very much.
Montero, there is no DEA team, all right?

24:55.847 --> 24:58.115
I promise.
Shh!

25:12.598 --> 25:13.631
I don't see nothing.

25:17.103 --> 25:18.337
Try his radio.

25:19.973 --> 25:21.374
Try his radio.

25:21.441 --> 25:22.708
I promise you,
you'll hear them coming.

25:22.776 --> 25:24.811
Montero, this is crazy!

25:24.879 --> 25:25.912
Nobody is coming!

25:25.980 --> 25:27.747
I'll get a DEA frequency.

25:27.815 --> 25:30.649
Go get
this <i>puto's</i> radio.

25:30.717 --> 25:34.086
Yeah, yeah, go get
this <i>puto's</i> radio.

25:34.154 --> 25:36.222
Mike, we're really gonna try and
sell that we're here to rescue Kemp?

25:36.290 --> 25:38.458
It might be our only shot
to get Jesse out alive.

25:45.933 --> 25:49.402
All personnel
proceed with caution.

25:49.470 --> 25:52.372
Assume that the suspects
are armed and dangerous. Over.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.474
Roger that. Over.

25:54.542 --> 25:57.143
Be aware,
we have one friendly inside.

25:57.211 --> 25:59.045
Do not fire on Agent Kemp.

25:59.113 --> 26:00.714
Oh!
Please, Montero!

26:00.781 --> 26:02.882
I don't know
who these people are, I swear!

26:02.950 --> 26:04.917
Montero, please!
I don't know these people!

26:04.985 --> 26:07.120
Come here.

26:07.188 --> 26:09.022
Come here.
No, no.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.657
I'm not gonna hurt you.

26:10.724 --> 26:12.125
What,
am I gonna shoot a cop?

26:12.193 --> 26:13.026
Come here.

26:15.963 --> 26:18.931
You're gonna signal them
that everything's fine.

26:18.999 --> 26:22.602
And then we're just gonna
sit here and talk.

26:22.669 --> 26:23.802
Okay?

26:23.870 --> 26:25.471
I've got a visual
on Kemp.

26:25.538 --> 26:27.306
I repeat, I have a visual
on Agent Kemp.

26:27.374 --> 26:28.974
I got a better idea.

26:29.042 --> 26:30.509
Go out and talk to them yourself!

26:42.055 --> 26:43.388
Agent down!
Agent down!

26:43.456 --> 26:44.823
Let's go!

26:50.462 --> 26:52.229
Looks like Jesse pulled it off.

26:57.034 --> 27:00.703
You wanted Kemp?
There he is.

27:03.207 --> 27:05.342
I forgot what a pleasure it is
working with you.

27:07.545 --> 27:09.613
So, I've been asking
around the cellblock,

27:09.681 --> 27:12.249
and the news isn't good.

27:12.317 --> 27:15.119
Word is, standing next to you
is a good way to catch a shank.

27:15.187 --> 27:17.289
We'll have to make sure
that doesn't happen.

27:17.356 --> 27:18.790
Apparently,
D.B. and her crew

27:18.858 --> 27:20.425
are gonna jump you
in the laundry room.

27:20.493 --> 27:23.562
But I can get you transferred
to the kitchen.

27:23.630 --> 27:24.830
It's way safer,

27:24.898 --> 27:26.632
and they keep
the work teams small.

27:26.699 --> 27:29.635
Well, that'll save me a beating
while I'm on work duty.

27:29.703 --> 27:32.438
They can still get to me
anywhere else.

27:32.505 --> 27:34.106
I need a weapon.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.675
I mean,
to take on all three?

27:35.742 --> 27:38.110
Come on, it's not like
we have machine guns in here.

27:38.178 --> 27:41.514
Just tell me what you can get,
and I'll figure something out.

27:41.582 --> 27:43.082
<i>Creating tools in prison</i>

27:43.150 --> 27:44.917
<i>is about working with</i>
<i>what you have.</i>

27:44.985 --> 27:46.719
<i>Some things are simple,</i>

27:46.787 --> 27:48.387
<i>like making a knife</i>
<i>by sharpening a toothbrush.</i>

27:48.455 --> 27:50.056
<i>But with a little effort,</i>

27:50.123 --> 27:51.690
<i>it's possible</i>
<i>to get more sophisticated.</i>

27:51.758 --> 27:55.561
<i>Tightly rolled magazine pages</i>
<i>soaked in salt water</i>

27:55.628 --> 27:57.696
<i>can create a serviceable club.</i>

27:57.764 --> 27:59.932
<i>You can make a prison lighter</i>

28:00.000 --> 28:01.934
<i>by short-circuiting a double-A</i>
<i>battery with some wire</i>

28:02.002 --> 28:06.305
<i>and stripping the insulation</i>
<i>at the ignition point.</i>

28:06.373 --> 28:10.876
<i>Once you're done, the issue</i>
<i>is hiding what you've made.</i>

28:10.944 --> 28:12.711
Glenanne!

28:12.779 --> 28:14.360
Yard time. Let's go.

28:14.361 --> 28:16.482
<i>All the weapons in the world</i>
<i>won't help you...</i>

28:16.507 --> 28:17.324
<i>Let's go.</i>

28:17.326 --> 28:20.361
<i>...if they're sitting</i>
<i>in the warden's office.</i>

28:22.027 --> 28:24.112
<i>Carrying off a successful</i>
<i>attack in prison</i>

28:24.113 --> 28:27.082
<i>or any institutional</i>
<i>environment is a challenge.</i>

28:27.149 --> 28:29.618
<i>There are simply more factors</i>
<i>to consider</i>

28:29.686 --> 28:31.120
<i>than in a regular fight.</i>

28:31.187 --> 28:33.189
<i>You have to deal</i>
<i>with bystanders,</i>

28:33.256 --> 28:36.459
<i>any of whom could decide</i>
<i>to jump in on either side.</i>

28:36.527 --> 28:37.894
Open cellblock "D."

28:37.962 --> 28:39.296
Yard time, ladies!

28:39.364 --> 28:41.398
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>if you don't remove the guards,</i>

28:41.466 --> 28:46.169
<i>the fight will be over</i>
<i>before it starts.</i>

28:46.237 --> 28:48.338
Let's move!
<i>Even if you do everything right,</i>

28:48.405 --> 28:50.106
<i>you'll only have</i>
<i>a small window of time.</i>

28:50.174 --> 28:54.677
<i>But, hopefully,</i>
<i>that's all you need.</i>

29:00.650 --> 29:02.451
Code Red in tier 3!

29:02.519 --> 29:04.386
There's a Code Red in tier 3!

29:04.454 --> 29:06.121
There's a fire
on cellblock "D"!

29:06.189 --> 29:07.222
Fire in cellblock "D"!

29:07.290 --> 29:08.591
Hey!
Fire on cellblock "D"!

29:12.729 --> 29:15.831
Get out!
Ladies, clear out!

29:15.898 --> 29:16.731
Down the gate!

29:37.118 --> 29:38.584
Behind you!

30:01.612 --> 30:03.646
Fi! Come on!

30:11.688 --> 30:14.523
<i>The most dangerous time</i>
<i>in an infiltration</i>

30:14.590 --> 30:17.259
<i>is often when you've completely</i>
<i>sold your target</i>

30:17.327 --> 30:18.560
<i>and made your way in.</i>

30:18.628 --> 30:20.095
<i>The reason is that your target</i>

30:20.162 --> 30:21.930
<i>is usually bringing you</i>
<i>to his boss,</i>

30:21.997 --> 30:25.233
<i>and upper management</i>
<i>tends to be harder to convince.</i>

30:25.300 --> 30:28.703
How could they have found out
about Black Rock Cove?

30:31.573 --> 30:34.241
We've been sending
our shipments there for months.

30:34.309 --> 30:36.844
Kemp was a DEA plant.
That <i>puto</i> sold us out.

30:36.912 --> 30:38.145
Kemp?

30:38.213 --> 30:40.848
You were the one
who vouched for that <i>rata.</i>

30:40.916 --> 30:42.149
I know, Don Ramiro.

30:42.217 --> 30:43.785
But I took care of it.

30:43.853 --> 30:45.086
This is our new DEA agent.

30:45.154 --> 30:46.889
Our friend here
is gonna help us out.

30:46.956 --> 30:48.624
You got nothing
to worry about, sir.

30:48.692 --> 30:50.660
I got you a new place
to send your shipment.

30:50.727 --> 30:51.794
It's all good.

30:51.862 --> 30:53.096
He says
Dadeland Cove is clear.

30:53.163 --> 30:54.697
DEA can't operate
there, right?

30:54.765 --> 30:56.600
Right, yeah.
You believe this man?

30:56.667 --> 30:59.870
Don Ramiro, I saw the man
that he killed with my own eyes.

30:59.938 --> 31:01.572
Fine.

31:01.640 --> 31:05.843
Go see this raid
at Black Rock Cove

31:05.910 --> 31:07.111
with your own eyes.

31:07.179 --> 31:08.946
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on.

31:09.014 --> 31:10.447
You want us to go look
for a DEA raid?

31:10.515 --> 31:13.150
Yes. That way, we know
you're telling the truth.

31:13.218 --> 31:15.552
That way, we know
we can move our shipment.

31:15.620 --> 31:16.687
Okay, okay,
I'm just saying

31:16.754 --> 31:17.821
it could be
a little dangerous.

31:17.889 --> 31:19.723
You know?
And if they see me, I'm...

31:20.858 --> 31:23.093
You claim to be a friend.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.895
Show us what a good friend
you really are.

31:25.963 --> 31:29.566
Okay, we got to get
a whole squad of DEA guys

31:29.633 --> 31:30.967
over to Black Rock Cove
right now.

31:31.035 --> 31:32.269
Only there's no time.

31:32.336 --> 31:34.170
All my agents are already
set up at Dadeland Cove,

31:34.238 --> 31:35.438
awaiting the real shipment.

31:35.506 --> 31:36.906
Fine.
We'll be the team.

31:36.974 --> 31:38.474
Jesse and Montero

31:38.542 --> 31:40.309
just need to see enough to
sell that there <i>is</i> a raid --

31:40.377 --> 31:42.544
a few cars, a few guns
in the right place.

31:42.612 --> 31:44.980
I like it, Mike.
We don't have a lot of time.

31:45.048 --> 31:47.050
Let me deal with that.

31:55.171 --> 31:56.938
Michael! That was some
pretty fancy driving.

31:57.006 --> 31:58.406
I'm still not sure
that gives us

31:58.474 --> 32:00.442
enough of a head start
on Montero and Jesse, though.

32:00.510 --> 32:02.110
Montero's not gonna risk
a speeding ticket.

32:02.178 --> 32:03.545
We have five minutes,
give or take.

32:03.612 --> 32:04.913
Oh, great.

32:04.980 --> 32:06.481
Five minutes until the guys
with guns show up.

32:06.549 --> 32:08.817
No problem.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.219
<i>Convincing someone</i>

32:10.287 --> 32:12.488
<i>that they're looking at an army</i>
<i>that's not there</i>

32:12.555 --> 32:14.189
<i>is about the little details --</i>

32:14.257 --> 32:16.191
<i>the barrel</i>
<i>of a high-powered rifle,</i>

32:16.259 --> 32:18.927
<i>combined with the bulkiness of</i>
<i>a seatback under a plastic tarp</i>

32:18.995 --> 32:21.630
<i>can sell the presence of a team</i>
<i>of concealed snipers</i>

32:21.698 --> 32:24.933
<i>ready to supply cover fire.</i>

32:25.001 --> 32:27.636
<i>A heavily loaded vehicle</i>

32:27.704 --> 32:29.438
<i>positioned</i>
<i>at a natural choke point</i>

32:29.506 --> 32:31.941
<i>gives the impression</i>
<i>of an assault team</i>

32:32.008 --> 32:33.876
<i>ready to storm a target.</i>

32:33.944 --> 32:36.612
<i>And a few well-placed agents</i>
<i>with earpieces</i>

32:36.680 --> 32:39.983
<i>look just like spotters</i>
<i>set to guide an assault team.</i>

32:40.050 --> 32:41.518
All right,
here they come.

32:43.621 --> 32:46.257
Time to put on
our best DEA faces.

32:52.899 --> 32:54.833
So, where's this raid,
<i>cabrón?</i>

32:54.900 --> 32:56.167
I don't see nobody.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.702
Look,
I-I-I told you, man.

32:57.770 --> 33:00.372
These guys aren't gonna just
set up out in the open, okay?

33:00.439 --> 33:02.073
So, look harder.

33:06.045 --> 33:08.046
Okay, right there.

33:08.114 --> 33:09.347
Right there.

33:09.415 --> 33:11.917
You see that van
by the water?

33:11.984 --> 33:13.118
Look at the guy
sitting up front.

33:13.185 --> 33:14.519
See how low he's riding?

33:14.587 --> 33:17.188
That's a comm van,
with a strike team in the back.

33:17.256 --> 33:20.025
<i>Hijos de puta...</i>
<i>You're right.</i>

33:20.093 --> 33:22.595
Yeah, let me see,
let me see.

33:25.566 --> 33:28.935
Bam. Right there, on top
of the building -- snipers.

33:29.003 --> 33:30.003
Where?

33:30.071 --> 33:32.172
Ho, ho, ho.

33:32.239 --> 33:34.140
These guys don't mess around,
do they?

33:34.208 --> 33:36.309
That's why I shouldn't
be here right now.

33:36.376 --> 33:38.978
Okay.
Right there by the dock.

33:39.046 --> 33:41.513
You see the guy with
the earpiece? Check him out.

33:41.581 --> 33:42.648
That's a lookout.

33:42.715 --> 33:44.549
He's reporting
back to the van.

33:44.617 --> 33:46.952
Something tells me the guy behind
the wheel is calling the shots here.

33:47.020 --> 33:49.021
No, that <i>puto</i>
<i>only thinks he is.</i>

33:52.259 --> 33:54.226
Don Ramiro?

33:54.293 --> 33:55.994
The new guy
was telling the truth.

33:56.062 --> 33:57.430
The DEA is here.

33:57.497 --> 33:59.999
It's safe to move the shipment
to the new location.

34:02.203 --> 34:03.903
All right.
All right, we good?

34:03.971 --> 34:05.672
Yes, we're good.

34:05.740 --> 34:07.040
We're very good.
Okay.

34:07.108 --> 34:08.542
Just got to get the guns.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.277
The guns? Hold on.
Wait a minute.

34:10.346 --> 34:11.846
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

34:11.914 --> 34:13.313
Salazar wants us
to keep the DEA busy

34:13.382 --> 34:14.783
while the shipment
comes in.

34:14.850 --> 34:16.083
We're just gonna start shooting
at the DEA?! Are you crazy?!

34:16.152 --> 34:17.985
Relax, bro.
They're looking the other way.

34:18.054 --> 34:19.320
They'll be dead before they know
what hit them.

34:19.388 --> 34:20.655
I say
we hit the van first.

34:20.723 --> 34:22.056
Guys, you heard that,
right?

34:22.123 --> 34:23.591
Get out of the van
now, Michael.

34:23.659 --> 34:24.759
I'm not bailing now.

34:24.827 --> 34:26.228
Montero will know
we're listening,

34:26.295 --> 34:27.728
and Jesse's cover
will be blown.

34:27.797 --> 34:28.929
It doesn't matter,
Michael!

34:28.998 --> 34:30.366
Get out of the van now!

34:30.433 --> 34:31.433
Watch me
light these pigs up.

34:31.501 --> 34:32.868
We're not getting Jesse...

34:39.844 --> 34:41.011
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell?!

34:41.078 --> 34:42.245
You're letting him
get away!

34:42.313 --> 34:43.580
Forget the driver.
The team's in the back.

34:43.648 --> 34:45.416
Their weapons,
their explosives!

34:45.483 --> 34:47.418
Oh, yeah.

35:00.831 --> 35:02.565
Whoo!

35:02.633 --> 35:05.968
Burn in hell,
<i>hijos de puta!</i>

35:06.036 --> 35:07.236
Whoo!

35:09.239 --> 35:11.674
Unh! You two stay here
and pick off these DEA <i>pendejos</i>

35:11.742 --> 35:13.676
when they come back
to check on the van.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.745
All right, come on,
let's go check on our shipment.

35:15.813 --> 35:17.647
Yeah.

35:17.715 --> 35:19.249
Happy hunting, <i>cabrones!</i>

35:25.390 --> 35:27.491
You made us a lot
of money today, <i>cabrón.</i>

35:27.559 --> 35:29.893
Anything to help, man.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.161
Man!

35:31.229 --> 35:34.231
I wish I could have seen
those pigs burn myself.

35:34.299 --> 35:35.399
Love a good barbecue.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.533
Yeah.

35:36.601 --> 35:38.402
Yeah, me too.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.336
Oh.

35:43.074 --> 35:45.542
Don Ramiro, yeah, yeah.

35:45.610 --> 35:46.810
We're on our way.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.379
You should have seen the way
we shot up the DEA.

35:49.447 --> 35:51.114
Oh, really?

35:51.182 --> 35:53.016
Then explain why
our entire shipment --

35:53.084 --> 35:55.085
our entire operation in Miami --

35:55.153 --> 35:57.654
is getting swept up
by the DEA as we speak?

35:57.722 --> 35:59.389
I -- I don't understand.

35:59.457 --> 36:00.624
Get back here.

36:00.692 --> 36:03.060
We need to discuss
what happened today.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.162
Uh...

36:06.230 --> 36:08.998
the shipment --
the DEA hit the shipment.

36:09.066 --> 36:10.099
I -- I -- I don't understand.

36:10.167 --> 36:12.101
Hey, what's happening?

36:12.169 --> 36:13.970
Don Ramiro just called.

36:14.037 --> 36:15.905
He said that the --
that the DEA hit the shipment.

36:15.973 --> 36:17.674
I told him the DEA is there.
I told him I shot them.

36:17.742 --> 36:18.875
There's no one here.

36:18.943 --> 36:20.343
What?!
The van! What about the van?!

36:20.411 --> 36:21.678
No one came
to check up on it.

36:21.746 --> 36:22.746
Uh...

36:26.651 --> 36:29.519
You, you, you. This was you,
huh?! You set me up!

36:29.587 --> 36:31.488
No, no, listen, listen!
You set me up!

36:31.556 --> 36:32.856
You pull that trigger,
you're dead.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.826
The cartel is gonna kill you
for this, and you know it.

36:35.893 --> 36:38.395
Look, putting a bullet
in my head

36:38.462 --> 36:40.263
is not gonna change that.

36:40.331 --> 36:41.431
Okay?

36:41.499 --> 36:42.999
I got another business
proposition for you.

36:43.067 --> 36:44.567
Listen to me!
Just listen to me!

36:44.635 --> 36:47.937
Put the gun down.
Come work for us.

36:48.005 --> 36:50.539
Think about it, man.
It's your only move.

36:50.607 --> 36:53.742
Maybe my move is I shoot you
in the head

36:53.810 --> 36:55.744
and then do my time like a man!
Do your time?

36:55.812 --> 36:56.946
W-what, you think Ramiro

36:57.013 --> 36:58.246
is gonna let you
just sit in prison?

36:58.314 --> 37:00.582
Why not?
I was a good soldier, huh?

37:00.650 --> 37:03.317
Who knows everything
about his operation...

37:03.385 --> 37:05.653
who's already been duped
by the DEA.

37:05.721 --> 37:08.256
Something tells me that Ramiro
is not the kind of guy

37:08.323 --> 37:12.760
that's gonna take the risk of
letting you just hang around.

37:12.827 --> 37:15.496
Now, you might be crazy,
but you're not stupid.

37:15.564 --> 37:17.831
Put the gun down, come work with us,
and you will live.

37:21.503 --> 37:23.437
<i>Hijo de puta!</i>

37:23.505 --> 37:26.874
No, no!
Aah! Ugh!

37:26.942 --> 37:28.642
Ugh!

37:29.711 --> 37:31.112
Okay, man.

37:31.179 --> 37:35.049
My Spanish is a little rusty,
but I assume that meant "yes."

37:35.117 --> 37:38.687
Like I said,
you're one hell of a salesman.

37:47.098 --> 37:52.535
Landed a 2-ton cocaine bust,
a dirty DEA agent,

37:52.603 --> 37:54.237
and a cooperating
witness.

37:54.305 --> 37:55.839
That's a hell
of a plate appearance.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.774
You scored some major points
at Langley today.

37:57.842 --> 37:59.742
Does that mean
I get to see Fiona?

37:59.810 --> 38:01.410
After today's win, I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

38:03.747 --> 38:05.614
Thanks, Card.

38:07.850 --> 38:11.552
Come back to the office with me,
get some yogurt.

38:21.772 --> 38:23.773
Hey, bro, it's me.

38:23.841 --> 38:25.275
Still with the gun?

38:25.342 --> 38:27.244
Man, you're in worse shape
than we thought.

38:29.113 --> 38:31.214
Any more word about Fi?

38:31.282 --> 38:33.583
I might be able
to see her soon.

38:33.650 --> 38:36.219
That's great.
I'm happy for you, man.

38:36.287 --> 38:38.421
I rely appreciate
you coming by, Nate,

38:38.489 --> 38:41.658
but you should be home
with Ruth and the baby.

38:41.726 --> 38:44.628
Yeah, I should.

38:44.696 --> 38:47.765
But here's the thing.
Mike, I can't.

38:47.833 --> 38:49.701
That's actually
why I came over.

38:49.769 --> 38:51.736
You know, mom didn't drag me
all the way down here

38:51.804 --> 38:54.773
just because you were
having problems.

38:56.176 --> 38:58.744
Ruth left me.
She took the baby.

38:58.812 --> 39:01.013
That's how come I'm staying
with her for a little while.

39:02.515 --> 39:04.282
What happened?

39:06.919 --> 39:09.721
I don't know.

39:09.789 --> 39:12.991
I mean, I -- I tried so hard

39:13.059 --> 39:15.827
to be a good dad
and a good husband, you know?

39:17.163 --> 39:21.065
Then one day, she just
called it quits, and...

39:21.133 --> 39:22.900
I'm really sorry, Nate.

39:27.940 --> 39:29.140
Me too.

39:32.044 --> 39:35.046
Anyways, I'm gonna get out
of your hair, all right?

39:35.114 --> 39:37.182
But, uh, I just wanted
to stop by,

39:37.249 --> 39:38.449
see how <i>you</i> were doing.

39:40.419 --> 39:41.686
Hey, Nate.

39:41.753 --> 39:43.254
Yeah?

39:44.456 --> 39:45.890
Why don't you stay?

39:49.461 --> 39:51.162
Thanks.

39:55.233 --> 39:57.400
Make sure you get
the bottoms of the pans,

39:57.468 --> 39:58.635
'cause if there's
any spots,

39:58.703 --> 40:00.370
you'll be put back
on laundry detail.

40:00.437 --> 40:01.504
Yeah, well,
I'm working on it.

40:01.572 --> 40:03.239
It's just this water
is so damn hot.

40:03.307 --> 40:04.807
I know,
it's so boiling.

40:04.875 --> 40:07.343
I think they do that
to mess with us.

40:07.410 --> 40:09.712
But it's still the best job
you can get,

40:09.779 --> 40:13.916
because it's the most privacy
we are ever gonna have.

40:13.984 --> 40:14.984
Oh.

40:15.052 --> 40:16.852
Thanks for getting me
the transfer.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.589
Oh, you're welcome.
The guard owed me a favor.

40:19.657 --> 40:21.190
Mm.

40:21.258 --> 40:23.793
Well, let me know
if there's anything I can do

40:23.861 --> 40:25.127
to pay you back.

40:25.195 --> 40:27.262
Oh, well, just scrub those pans
really hard

40:27.330 --> 40:28.964
and make me look good.

40:30.700 --> 40:34.502
Oh, I see, yeah, there's
like one spot left there.

40:34.570 --> 40:37.940
Oh. I don't see it.

40:39.943 --> 40:40.643
Unh!

40:53.358 --> 40:55.626
Aaah!

40:59.030 --> 41:00.898
Who sent you to kill me? Was it D.B.?
Did she put you up to this?

41:00.965 --> 41:03.333
No!
Who sent you?

41:03.400 --> 41:05.301
There was a cellphone
under my pillow!

41:05.369 --> 41:07.236
A phone? What the hell
are you talking about?

41:07.304 --> 41:08.737
I got a phone call,

41:08.805 --> 41:11.839
and they said they would kill my
sister if I didn't kill you --

41:11.907 --> 41:13.775
and if I get close to you
to do it somewhere quiet.

41:13.842 --> 41:14.997
Tell me who.

41:15.022 --> 41:18.366
I don't know! But they said
they wanted you dead!
