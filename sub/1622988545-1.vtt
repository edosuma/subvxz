1:03:14.391 --> 1:03:16.424
but, yeah, they were
playing around a little bit.

1:03:16.527 --> 1:03:17.726
But, after the wife found out,

1:03:17.828 --> 1:03:19.027
<i> they ended things,</i>

1:03:19.129 --> 1:03:20.262
and then that was that.

1:03:20.364 --> 1:03:21.897
It got ugly for a minute,

1:03:21.999 --> 1:03:23.865
but everyone got past it.

1:03:23.967 --> 1:03:24.866
It ended.

1:03:24.968 --> 1:03:26.635
Everyone got past it?

1:03:26.737 --> 1:03:27.969

1:03:32.276 --> 1:03:33.875
I don't know.

1:03:33.977 --> 1:03:36.645
Erin tried completely hard
to get over him,

1:03:36.747 --> 1:03:38.446
<i> but... That stupid poem.</i>

1:03:38.549 --> 1:03:40.215

She had just fallen
so hard for him.

1:04:22.092 --> 1:04:24.025
You're like a secret of mine,

1:04:31.201 --> 1:04:33.268

Jessie, guess what?

1:04:48.018 --> 1:04:51.219
Yeah. I'm sure it's yours.

We brought you back in, jon,

1:06:11.301 --> 1:06:13.001
because we now know

1:06:13.103 --> 1:06:14.569
that erin's baby
wasn't yours,

1:06:14.671 --> 1:06:15.770
and you knew it.

1:06:15.872 --> 1:06:16.838

1:06:16.940 --> 1:06:18.006
It wasn't your baby.

1:06:18.108 --> 1:06:19.908
It was chris's.

I never thought it was chris's.

1:06:24.915 --> 1:06:25.914
Come on.

1:06:26.016 --> 1:06:27.248
You're not stupid, jon.

1:06:27.351 --> 1:06:29.017
You followed her out
to the desert that morning,

1:06:29.119 --> 1:06:30.752
and you killed her.

1:06:30.854 --> 1:06:33.555
No.

1:06:33.657 --> 1:06:35.323
I didn't.

1:06:35.425 --> 1:06:37.726
We spoke to erin's mother

We know that erin and chris
kept seeing each other

1:06:39.963 --> 1:06:41.529

1:06:41.631 --> 1:06:43.331

Yes, you did, jon.

1:06:57.280 --> 1:06:58.847
You did.

1:07:00.584 --> 1:07:03.685
[♪♪♪]

1:07:03.787 --> 1:07:05.987
I did not kill my wife.

Your name is jon corwin?

1:07:11.561 --> 1:07:13.361
Yes.

1:07:13.463 --> 1:07:16.297
Your wife is erin corwin?

1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:17.766
Yes.

1:07:17.868 --> 1:07:20.068
Do you know where your wife is?

1:07:20.170 --> 1:07:23.304
<i> No.</i>

1:07:23.407 --> 1:07:25.440

1:07:34.418 --> 1:07:36.151
No.

1:07:39.289 --> 1:07:41.423
Did you kill your wife?

1:07:42.993 --> 1:07:44.826
You got something?

1:07:44.928 --> 1:07:47.429
A second set of tire tracks.

1:07:47.531 --> 1:07:49.431
She wasn't alone out here.

1:07:51.234 --> 1:07:52.700
No.

1:08:00.277 --> 1:08:00.875
You lied about
your affair with erin.

1:08:00.977 --> 1:08:02.377
Why?

1:08:02.479 --> 1:08:04.345
I don't know.
I didn't think it was important.

1:08:04.448 --> 1:08:05.980
And I would say,
right there,

1:08:06.083 --> 1:08:08.083
you just lied to us again.

1:08:08.185 --> 1:08:09.551
Anything but the truth

1:08:09.653 --> 1:08:11.820
adds up to be
very bad news for you, chris.

1:08:11.922 --> 1:08:14.589
That kind of thing is a crime
in the marines.

1:08:14.691 --> 1:08:16.391
It'd get you court-martialed.

1:08:16.493 --> 1:08:17.992
We're not
the marriage police, chris.

1:08:18.095 --> 1:08:20.361
We don't care
who you do the macarena with.

1:08:20.464 --> 1:08:22.497
But if your dance partner
goes missing--

1:08:22.599 --> 1:08:24.599
especially if she's pregnant
with your kid--

1:08:24.701 --> 1:08:27.168
well, in our profession,
that's what we call

1:08:27.270 --> 1:08:29.104
an intriguing set
of coincidences.

1:08:29.206 --> 1:08:31.272
It wasn't my kid.

1:08:31.374 --> 1:08:32.674
[woods] you sure about that?

1:08:32.776 --> 1:08:34.509
We never had sex.

1:08:34.611 --> 1:08:37.612
Then why all the worry
about court-martial?

1:08:37.714 --> 1:08:40.014
I mean, we-we messed around
a little bit, but that was--

1:08:40.117 --> 1:08:41.483
[tabor] but you never went
all the way?

1:08:41.585 --> 1:08:42.917
We know
from erin's best friend

1:08:43.019 --> 1:08:44.919
that you and erin
had sex, chris.

1:08:45.021 --> 1:08:46.621
That's not true.

1:08:46.723 --> 1:08:48.223
Okay, so walk us through it.

1:08:48.325 --> 1:08:50.525
She had sex with you,
but you somehow didn't notice?

1:08:50.627 --> 1:08:51.693
No, I mean that--

1:08:51.795 --> 1:08:54.996
[woods] do you wanna
read through their texts?

1:08:55.966 --> 1:08:57.832
No.

1:08:57.934 --> 1:09:00.869
Assume we know everything.

1:09:02.506 --> 1:09:05.273
I got a wife and kid
that I want to keep.

1:09:05.375 --> 1:09:06.608
You can understand

1:09:06.710 --> 1:09:08.676
why I wouldn't want this
getting out.

1:09:08.778 --> 1:09:10.311
Oh, we completely understand.

1:09:10.413 --> 1:09:12.080
Matter of fact,

1:09:12.182 --> 1:09:13.414
we could also understand why

1:09:13.517 --> 1:09:15.250
you'd want this whole problem
to go away.

1:09:16.386 --> 1:09:17.919
I never met erin that day.

1:09:21.758 --> 1:09:23.758
We found erin's car.

1:09:23.860 --> 1:09:26.995
And two sets
of tire tracks.

1:09:27.097 --> 1:09:29.664
One set that matches your jeep.

1:09:31.301 --> 1:09:33.902
I never met erin
that day, guys.

1:09:35.005 --> 1:09:37.038
So why all the lies?

1:09:37.140 --> 1:09:39.207
Where's her body, chris?

1:09:41.178 --> 1:09:43.678
You don't know?

1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:45.880
See, I thought
you knew everything.

1:09:47.484 --> 1:09:48.483
Chris didn't ask you

1:09:48.585 --> 1:09:50.485
to go with him
to the desert that day?

1:09:50.587 --> 1:09:51.920
No, no. Not that day.

1:09:52.022 --> 1:09:53.721
But you say,
normally, he does?

1:09:53.823 --> 1:09:55.957
Yeah.

1:09:56.059 --> 1:09:57.926
So why was that day different,
do you think?

1:09:58.028 --> 1:09:59.227
I don't know,
I just assume

1:09:59.329 --> 1:10:02.230
that he was out
looking for a mine shaft.

1:10:02.332 --> 1:10:03.565
Mine shaft?

1:10:03.667 --> 1:10:05.200
Yeah, there's...

1:10:05.302 --> 1:10:07.502
I don't know, there's
millions of 'em out there,

1:10:07.604 --> 1:10:10.572
and chris always had this idea
that he wanted to, uh...

1:10:10.674 --> 1:10:12.207
Blow up an old mine shaft.

1:10:12.309 --> 1:10:14.342
We'd go out there,
we'd shoot things, you know,

1:10:14.444 --> 1:10:15.610
blow stuff up.

1:10:15.712 --> 1:10:18.179
But chris had gotten this, um,
this propane tank,

1:10:18.281 --> 1:10:21.516
and, um, was wanting
to blow up an old mine with it.

1:10:21.618 --> 1:10:23.818
That's helpful. Thanks.

1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:25.787
Yeah.

1:10:26.990 --> 1:10:28.389
[woods]
if anybody can find her,

1:10:28.491 --> 1:10:29.791
it's you, doug,

1:10:29.893 --> 1:10:31.125
but, regrettably,

1:10:31.228 --> 1:10:32.727
this is no longer
a rescue operation.

1:10:32.829 --> 1:10:34.796
It's now a recovery operation.

1:10:34.898 --> 1:10:36.364
We're acting on a hunch

1:10:36.466 --> 1:10:38.733
that our victim might be down
one of the old mines out here.

1:10:38.835 --> 1:10:40.835
Well, hell, this valley here

1:10:40.937 --> 1:10:43.271
has a hundred mines
all on its own

1:10:43.373 --> 1:10:44.372
that haven't been marked.

1:10:44.474 --> 1:10:46.207
It's endless.

1:10:46.309 --> 1:10:47.976
Damn near.

1:10:48.078 --> 1:10:50.078
So, basically, we're trying
to find a needle in the desert.

1:10:50.180 --> 1:10:52.146

Okay. Bring it up.
Let's move on.

1:12:44.561 --> 1:12:46.227
The grueling search
for erin corwin

1:12:46.329 --> 1:12:48.830
has been ongoing
for seven long weeks.

1:12:48.932 --> 1:12:49.931
Hundreds of people

1:12:50.033 --> 1:12:52.700
covering 2,000 square miles
of the desert,

1:12:52.802 --> 1:12:55.770
and, so far, not a trace
of the missing woman.

1:12:55.872 --> 1:12:57.071
Authorities tell me

1:12:57.173 --> 1:12:58.706
that they will
abandon the search

1:12:58.808 --> 1:13:01.142
in 24 hours.

1:13:07.417 --> 1:13:10.017
But you think chris did it,
don't you?

1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:11.819
He's still a suspect...

1:13:11.921 --> 1:13:13.421
Yeah.

1:13:13.523 --> 1:13:15.089
And if she doesn't turn up,

1:13:15.191 --> 1:13:18.126
that son of a bitch is gonna get
away with it, isn't he?

1:13:18.228 --> 1:13:19.293
Jon...

1:13:19.396 --> 1:13:22.497
It's possible
we may never find her.

1:13:29.239 --> 1:13:31.572
There's a few more mines
up in this region.

1:13:31.674 --> 1:13:33.007

Uh, mr. Lee,

1:17:42.125 --> 1:17:45.459
you have pled "not guilty"
to this crime.

1:17:45.561 --> 1:17:46.594
Is that correct?

1:17:46.696 --> 1:17:48.663
Yes, sir.

And you've, uh, you've taken
the stand here today

1:18:04.113 --> 1:18:05.713
so that the jury can hear

1:18:05.815 --> 1:18:07.815
that erin corwin
gave you no choice

1:18:07.917 --> 1:18:10.584
but to do
what you admit you did.

1:18:10.687 --> 1:18:14.822
That it was
a spontaneous crime of passion,

1:18:14.924 --> 1:18:17.224
and not a cold-blooded,
premeditated murder--

1:18:17.326 --> 1:18:18.292
is that correct?

1:18:19.395 --> 1:18:21.595
She wanted
to destroy my family.

1:18:22.665 --> 1:18:24.165
Mr. Lee, uh...

1:18:24.267 --> 1:18:25.466

1:18:28.304 --> 1:18:31.939
I wanted to talk to her
away from everything,

1:18:32.041 --> 1:18:34.709

talk some sense into her.

1:18:34.811 --> 1:18:36.177
I wanted to tell her

1:18:36.279 --> 1:18:38.612
that she and I were not
gonna end up together.

1:18:38.715 --> 1:18:42.183
Were you, uh, able to get
through to her?

1:18:43.519 --> 1:18:45.052
No.

1:18:46.456 --> 1:18:49.690
It's quite a long drive
out into the desert, mr. Lee.

1:18:49.792 --> 1:18:50.825
God only knows

1:18:50.927 --> 1:18:52.359
you had plenty of time
to make your case.

1:18:53.763 --> 1:18:55.429
She was gonna destroy
me and my family,

1:18:55.531 --> 1:18:56.897
and she didn't care.

1:18:56.999 --> 1:18:59.467
She pushed me to a point
where I just snapped.

1:19:00.737 --> 1:19:03.003
You blame erin?

1:19:04.107 --> 1:19:06.240

to reason...
