00:01.126 --> 00:02.791
Previously on <i>Pretty Little Liars</i>

00:02.797 --> 00:04.131
<i>We're going to replace.</i>

00:04.132 --> 00:05.799
Garrett's note with a
fake note that we wrote.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.100
You sure this is it?

00:07.101 --> 00:08.335
She never took it off.

00:08.336 --> 00:09.737
Told them I got
an anonymous tip.

00:09.738 --> 00:10.738
They seemed to believe me.

00:10.739 --> 00:11.971
The anklet had trace amounts.

00:11.972 --> 00:12.905
Of blood still on it...

00:12.906 --> 00:14.741
Alison's and someone else's.

00:14.742 --> 00:17.277
If only I could remember what happened
that night, this would all be over.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.911
I don't think
it's that simple, em.

00:18.912 --> 00:20.380
I met Jenna here
yesterday afternoon.

00:20.381 --> 00:22.248
I wanna know more.
No, you don't.

00:22.249 --> 00:24.049
"Hot mama loves tango"?

00:24.050 --> 00:26.319
I'm going to kill Aria.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.586
I can explain that.

00:27.587 --> 00:29.020
Hey there, Ashley.
Pastor.

00:29.021 --> 00:30.689
Detective wilden, right?
That's right.

00:30.690 --> 00:33.224
It's Ted. You're getting
them again, aren't you?

00:33.225 --> 00:34.293
The texts.

00:34.294 --> 00:35.594
What texts
are you talking about?

00:35.595 --> 00:37.195
Just be an act
to keep her out of jail.

00:37.196 --> 00:39.331
She can't hurt us
anymore, okay?

00:39.332 --> 00:40.399
Bitch crazy.

00:47.706 --> 00:50.675
No, mom, you don't have to go
over the rules with me again.

00:50.676 --> 00:55.179
No one is hanging out
in my room except for me.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.648
No, Caleb's not coming over.
He lost my number.

00:57.649 --> 00:59.783
Can we change the subject?

00:59.784 --> 01:01.951
Yes, mom.

01:01.952 --> 01:05.221
Hey, I'm up, I'm dressed,
and I'm fed.

01:05.221 --> 01:08.024
All right, enjoy
your conference. Love you.

01:14.498 --> 01:17.333
Morning, Hanna. Is your mom home?
Why?

01:17.334 --> 01:20.068
'Cause I'm not supposed to talk to
you without a guardian present.

01:20.069 --> 01:22.003
Like that's stopped you before.

01:22.004 --> 01:23.706
Do me a favor...
Tell your mom we need you.

01:23.707 --> 01:25.541
To come in for a blood sample.

01:25.542 --> 01:27.543
Why do you need my blood?

01:27.544 --> 01:29.545
We have new evidence
in the dilaurentis case,

01:29.546 --> 01:31.546
and the family wants answers.

01:31.547 --> 01:34.682
And since the blood on that anklet
doesn't match the guy who's locked up...

01:34.683 --> 01:36.217
What, so you think
it's my blood?

01:36.218 --> 01:38.319
O-negative,
same type as yours.

01:38.320 --> 01:40.287
Yeah, and probably
a billion other people.

01:40.288 --> 01:41.922
The billion other people
weren't slipping notes.

01:41.923 --> 01:43.424
Under a woman's
hospital bracelet.

01:43.425 --> 01:45.993
You have no proof
that I did that.

01:45.994 --> 01:48.027
Multiple witnesses saw you
coming out of that room, Hanna.

01:48.028 --> 01:50.029
Well, they're wrong.

01:52.166 --> 01:54.067
My blood is not
on your evidence.

01:54.068 --> 01:56.670
Then why do you look so scared?

02:03.911 --> 02:05.879
<i># got a
secret, can you keep it? #</i>

02:05.880 --> 02:08.381
<i># swear this one you'll save #</i>

02:08.382 --> 02:10.816
<i># better lock it</i>
<i>in your pocket #</i>

02:10.817 --> 02:14.020
<i># taking this one</i>
<i>to the grave #</i>

02:14.021 --> 02:16.289
<i># if I show you</i>
<i>then I know you #</i>

02:16.290 --> 02:18.591
# won't tell what I said #

02:18.592 --> 02:21.293
<i># 'cause two</i>
<i>can keep a secret #</i>

02:21.294 --> 02:23.828
# if one of them is dead #

02:23.852 --> 02:25.761

<font color="#ec14bd">www.Addic7ed.Com</font>

02:25.798 --> 02:27.532
That's why "A" wants
Garrett out of jail,

02:27.533 --> 02:28.533
so I can take his place.

02:28.534 --> 02:29.601
Okay, don't go there.

02:29.602 --> 02:31.169
It's already past there, Emily.

02:31.170 --> 02:33.571
He knows about the note,
he caught me at church,

02:33.572 --> 02:34.773
and it's my blood type.

02:34.774 --> 02:37.308
So what? You didn't
kill anybody.

02:37.309 --> 02:39.343
Wilden said that Ali's
family's been slamming him.

02:39.344 --> 02:40.744
Have you talked to Jason?

02:40.745 --> 02:43.180
No, I can't even
look him in the eye,

02:43.181 --> 02:45.582
but I'm gonna
talk to him today.

02:45.583 --> 02:46.650
Han, don't worry,

02:46.651 --> 02:47.885
there's nothing they can do.

02:47.886 --> 02:49.186
Until your mom
gets back tomorrow.

02:49.187 --> 02:50.988
So what? I have 48
hours left of freedom?

02:50.989 --> 02:53.924
Maybe Spencer's mom
can block the court order.

02:53.925 --> 02:55.959
You guys, what if
it <i>is</i> my blood?

02:55.960 --> 02:57.193
How?

02:57.194 --> 02:59.095
Seriously, how could
somebody take your blood.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.463
And you wouldn't even know it?

03:00.464 --> 03:03.633
Emily has a whole night
that she doesn't remember.

03:03.634 --> 03:05.101
Han, wait,
you need to...

03:05.102 --> 03:06.636
I can't talk
about this anymore.

03:06.637 --> 03:08.938
I have to go to school.

03:11.607 --> 03:13.976
Maybe one of us
should call her mom.

03:13.977 --> 03:16.278
I don't think her mom can have
any more pull with wilden.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.414
This isn't shoplifting.

03:18.415 --> 03:20.182
Take it from me,

03:20.183 --> 03:22.484
you're always better off
with a really good buy.

03:22.485 --> 03:23.585
Is it just me,

03:23.586 --> 03:25.987
or did that sound a lot like...

03:25.988 --> 03:28.189
Alison.

03:30.792 --> 03:32.327
Something wrong?

03:32.328 --> 03:36.230
Oh, no. Sorry.

03:36.231 --> 03:38.632
Wow, you just sound a lot
like one of our friends.

03:38.633 --> 03:40.434
Hope she's brilliant.

03:40.435 --> 03:41.634
What's her name?

03:41.635 --> 03:43.236
Alison dilaurentis.

03:45.539 --> 03:48.175
You were friends of Ali's.

03:48.176 --> 03:51.644
Me too. I'm Cece.
Spencer.

03:51.645 --> 03:53.413
Melissa hasting's
little sister.

03:53.414 --> 03:54.814
Ali talked about you.

03:54.815 --> 03:58.550
She talked about <i>all</i> of you.

03:58.551 --> 03:59.551
A lot.

03:59.552 --> 04:00.686
How do you know Ali?

04:00.687 --> 04:02.321
Before I moved to L.A.,

04:02.322 --> 04:05.257
our families rented
summer homes in cape may.

04:05.258 --> 04:08.127
We went through an intense
couple weeks together.

04:08.128 --> 04:10.229
I dated her brother, Jason.

04:10.230 --> 04:11.697
She never mentioned me
to you guys?

04:11.698 --> 04:13.531
No.

04:13.532 --> 04:14.966
Well, it was intense for me.

04:14.967 --> 04:16.801
She was going through
such a rough time,

04:16.802 --> 04:18.736
like a broken doll.

04:18.737 --> 04:20.904
So why did you move
back to rosewood?

04:20.906 --> 04:23.074
Listen, I hate to make tracks,
but I'm already late,

04:23.075 --> 04:25.510
and my boss is high-strung
and aggressively sober.

04:25.511 --> 04:27.045
Come visit me
at the new boutique.

04:27.046 --> 04:28.578
Across the street.

04:28.579 --> 04:30.247
Oh, and if you ever
feel like doing.

04:30.248 --> 04:31.681
A little free shopping,

04:31.682 --> 04:34.385
I'll be happy
to turn the other way.

04:34.386 --> 04:36.953
I-I think you're
thinking of Hanna.

04:36.954 --> 04:38.222
She's not here.

04:38.223 --> 04:40.357
Oh.

04:44.194 --> 04:45.895
Okay, that's not
just me, right?

04:45.896 --> 04:48.697
I mean, that chick
is freakishly like Ali.

04:48.698 --> 04:51.034
Or was Ali freakishly like her?

04:51.035 --> 04:53.536
I mean, one hip out,
the head tilt.

04:53.537 --> 04:54.803
Looking straight through you,

04:54.804 --> 04:56.472
like she knew all your secrets.

05:09.352 --> 05:12.021
Aria, hey.
What's... that?

05:12.022 --> 05:13.088
Bills.

05:13.089 --> 05:14.823
You forgot to tell <i>vanity fair.</i>

05:14.824 --> 05:16.458
That you moved.

05:16.459 --> 05:18.026
More importantly, what is that?

05:18.027 --> 05:20.461
Uh..Nonothing.
Impulse buy.

05:20.462 --> 05:23.531
I... kind of have
a date tonight.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.899
Excuse me?

05:24.900 --> 05:27.301
You heard me.
I met somebody,

05:27.302 --> 05:29.604
on that website
that you made me join.

05:29.605 --> 05:31.238
Oh, that's awesome!

05:31.239 --> 05:33.106
Well, why didn't you tell me?

05:33.107 --> 05:34.675
Because if I mention it
beforehand,

05:34.676 --> 05:36.877
I may be more nervous
than I already am.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.445
You do not need to be nervous.

05:38.446 --> 05:39.546
That is easy for you to say.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.147
You have dated
within this century.

05:41.148 --> 05:42.515
So, who is he,
where does he live,

05:42.516 --> 05:44.084
and what is the hair situation?

05:44.085 --> 05:46.219
Plenty, and it's on his head.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.655
Excellent.
Nice eyes?

05:48.656 --> 05:50.356
Yes. Kind of smiley.

05:50.357 --> 05:53.093
Think, I don't know,
like silver fox.

05:53.094 --> 05:56.496
Ooh, nice.

05:56.497 --> 05:58.264
That's... that's
what you're wearing?

05:58.265 --> 05:59.732
Well, I thought it was.

05:59.733 --> 06:01.334
Is it too much
for a coffee shop?

06:01.335 --> 06:02.935
Wait, why am I asking you?

06:02.936 --> 06:04.137
You wear forks as earrings.

06:04.138 --> 06:06.105
No, no, no, I like it.

06:06.106 --> 06:08.140
I do, and it's
pretty daring for you.

06:08.141 --> 06:11.076
And please, do not
wear a scarf with it.

06:11.077 --> 06:13.145
What makes you say
I would wear a scarf?

06:13.146 --> 06:16.215
Because I have known you
100% of my life.

06:18.050 --> 06:19.485
Bye.

06:51.516 --> 06:52.682
Toby.

06:52.683 --> 06:55.050
What are you doing here?

06:55.051 --> 06:58.086
I didn't feel like
leaving another message.

06:58.087 --> 07:00.222
Why are you avoiding me?

07:00.223 --> 07:01.923
I'm not.

07:01.924 --> 07:05.528
I know there wasn't anyone hounding
Hanna at that church dance.

07:05.529 --> 07:07.563
Why did you lie?

07:07.564 --> 07:09.664
I was with Jason.

07:09.665 --> 07:11.533
Why is that a secret?

07:15.371 --> 07:19.507
Okay, you know that anklet that
was turned in to the police?

07:19.508 --> 07:21.509
Well, he didn't find
that on his own.

07:21.510 --> 07:24.546
So, what? You needed something
to keep me busy for the night?

07:24.547 --> 07:25.579
Look, he got a tip,

07:25.580 --> 07:28.182
and Jason wants
to prove Garrett guilty.

07:28.183 --> 07:30.784
Yeah, but he ended up
doing the opposite.

07:30.785 --> 07:32.152
Well, I'm not giving up.

07:32.153 --> 07:34.354
I don't think that that
anklet proves anything.

07:34.355 --> 07:36.056
And you're sure of this?

07:36.057 --> 07:38.024
Why are you challenging me?

07:38.025 --> 07:41.061
Because there was a time when
you thought <i>i murdered Alison.</i>

07:41.062 --> 07:42.461
Remember?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.197
Evidence can get distorted,

07:44.198 --> 07:46.765
taken out of context.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.168
It's made me a lot
slower to pass judgment.

07:52.171 --> 07:53.638
Better get to class.

08:10.121 --> 08:11.788
Hey.

08:11.789 --> 08:13.591
How's my favorite barista?

08:13.592 --> 08:17.160
Busy, but they did take me off
of cappuccino probation, so...

08:17.161 --> 08:20.631
That's a thing? It is here.
What's up?

08:21.932 --> 08:23.466
What do you think?

08:25.703 --> 08:28.638
Got it for Jenna.

08:28.639 --> 08:31.641
I knew it.
I suck at buying gifts.

08:31.642 --> 08:33.275
They all smelled
like hairspray,

08:33.277 --> 08:34.977
so I got the one
with the nicest name.

08:34.977 --> 08:36.446
Why are you
buying her anything?

08:36.447 --> 08:38.547
Didn't bring a gift
to her party,

08:38.548 --> 08:39.948
and we have a date.

08:39.948 --> 08:42.150
Like, a date-date.

08:42.150 --> 08:43.719
And I need you to help me shop.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.556
The candle's great.
Jenna will love it.

08:47.557 --> 08:50.292
She has a highly developed
sense of smell.

08:50.293 --> 08:52.494
Come on, Emily.
I need your help.

08:52.495 --> 08:56.497
You guys are good friends.
We are? Who told you that?

08:56.498 --> 08:57.998
Jenna.

08:57.999 --> 09:01.034
She had some nice things
to say about Maya too.

09:01.035 --> 09:02.303
She didn't even know Maya.

09:02.304 --> 09:03.837
Not according to her.

09:03.838 --> 09:07.408
Maya drove her home from
school a couple of times.

09:07.409 --> 09:09.576
Look, I'll let you
get back to work,

09:09.577 --> 09:11.878
but, um, call me on your break.

09:23.624 --> 09:26.325
I mean, don't you just
find it a little bizarre.

09:26.326 --> 09:28.327
That she never even
mentioned her before?

09:28.328 --> 09:29.961
Hey, can you cheat
on a blood test?

09:29.962 --> 09:31.730
Okay, stop.
That's not gonna happen.

09:31.731 --> 09:34.433
What is that?

09:34.434 --> 09:35.934
Don't touch it!

09:35.935 --> 09:38.003
Ow!

09:38.004 --> 09:39.204
You okay?

09:43.842 --> 09:46.577
See how it easy it is
for me to get your blood?

10:04.176 --> 10:06.411
Do you think "A" has a key?
What is this thing?

10:06.412 --> 10:09.447
I don't know. We have to go
check upstairs. Slow down!

10:09.448 --> 10:11.115
What is this thing?
Does it mean something?

10:11.116 --> 10:13.217
I don't know
what it means, Aria.

10:13.218 --> 10:14.952
Well, then, why is it
on your kitchen counter?

10:14.953 --> 10:17.388
We have to go.
Okay, Hanna, stop, okay?

10:17.389 --> 10:18.655
Talk to me.
What is this?

10:20.525 --> 10:22.559
Do you remember that
earring "A" sent you?

10:22.560 --> 10:26.062
You buried this with Ali?
Just the hand thing.

10:26.063 --> 10:27.498
Why?

10:27.499 --> 10:30.967
Mona and I played it before
they found Ali's body.

10:45.816 --> 10:47.417
Seriously?
I know.

10:47.418 --> 10:48.751
I didn't believe in it either,

10:48.752 --> 10:51.152
but this summer,
me and my cousin.

10:51.153 --> 10:52.487
Contacted a ghost.

10:52.488 --> 10:55.424
Who knew all kinds
of impossible stuff.

10:55.425 --> 10:57.659
It was way freaky.

10:57.660 --> 11:00.261
I mean, if you're too scared...

11:04.967 --> 11:07.802
Spirits, can you hear us?

11:10.705 --> 11:12.039
Whoa.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.408
Okay, you did that.

11:14.409 --> 11:16.243
No, I didn't.

11:16.244 --> 11:19.279
Okay, what do you
want to ask it?

11:19.280 --> 11:21.581
I don't know. Does Sean
still have his "v" card?

11:21.582 --> 11:23.716
Like we need the spirit
world to tell us that?

11:26.386 --> 11:28.020
Let's ask if
Alison's coming back.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.957
Mona, don't. Why? You
know you want the answer.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.559
No, I'm not playing this.
Oh, deep down...

11:32.560 --> 11:34.694
You still think she's alive.
I don't want to talk about...

11:34.695 --> 11:36.696
Just put your fingers
down, for God's sake.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.364
I will ask the questions.

11:41.935 --> 11:46.204
Spirits, do you know what
happened to Alison dilaurentis?

11:50.376 --> 11:51.910
Okay, you did that.

11:51.911 --> 11:53.879
No, I didn't.

11:55.914 --> 11:57.582
Whoa.

12:02.421 --> 12:03.688
"A."

12:05.591 --> 12:06.724
"L."

12:12.063 --> 12:13.397
"I."

12:15.733 --> 12:17.267
Alison?

12:20.738 --> 12:23.607
"V."

12:23.608 --> 12:24.808
"E."

12:24.809 --> 12:26.510
Alive?

12:44.728 --> 12:46.128
Mona was already "A" by then.

12:46.129 --> 12:49.031
She probably hired somebody to
stand outside and scare you.

12:49.032 --> 12:51.033
Yeah, well, it worked.

12:52.903 --> 12:56.639
Wait. Did anyone besides
Mona know that story?

12:56.640 --> 12:59.206
This could prove that
she's in contact with "a."

12:59.207 --> 13:01.843
How else would they know
that this keepsake was yours?

13:01.844 --> 13:04.178
There's no way to find out
who else Mona told.

13:04.179 --> 13:05.580
She's not allowed visitors.

13:05.581 --> 13:08.016
I'm at the top of
the not-allowed list.

13:08.017 --> 13:10.251
Then I'll go.

13:10.252 --> 13:12.420
I don't care if I have
to scale the walls,

13:12.421 --> 13:13.821
I am talking to her today.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.661
I'm sleeping
at your house tonight.

13:20.662 --> 13:22.796
Yep.

13:31.772 --> 13:34.040
Jjason.

13:34.041 --> 13:36.542
Hey.

13:36.543 --> 13:38.410
What's up?

13:38.411 --> 13:41.948
I, uh, heard you were going to
be on the basketball courts.

13:41.949 --> 13:43.215
Yeah, I was.

13:43.216 --> 13:45.618
Pulled myself out of the game.
Why?

13:45.619 --> 13:48.787
Figured I'd hurt less people
running around the block.

13:48.788 --> 13:52.123
Right. Well, that answers
my next question.

13:52.124 --> 13:53.925
Which was?

13:53.926 --> 13:55.393
Are you okay?

13:57.563 --> 13:59.330
I'm so sorry that
I dragged you into this.

13:59.331 --> 14:00.699
It's not your fault, Spencer.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.067
You didn't make me walk
into that police station.

14:03.068 --> 14:05.069
I know, but I thought
that... I know.

14:05.070 --> 14:07.104
That this piece of jewelry
would have ended this.

14:07.105 --> 14:08.338
But it didn't, all right?

14:08.339 --> 14:09.939
Now, instead of
being the big hero,

14:09.940 --> 14:11.273
I'm back to being
the big screw-up.

14:11.274 --> 14:13.142
Nobody thinks that.
Really?

14:13.143 --> 14:16.879
Maybe I should let you pick up
my father from the airport.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.683
Do your parents think
that Garrett is still guilty,

14:20.684 --> 14:22.819
or do they think that
now it's somebody else?

14:22.820 --> 14:27.288
I don't know what they think. Never have.
Well, what do you think?

14:27.289 --> 14:29.557
I think that I'm done looking
for answers around here,

14:29.558 --> 14:32.060
that's what I think.
I'm not a detective,

14:32.061 --> 14:34.496
and I'm not a lawyer.

14:39.936 --> 14:44.739
Hey, I, uh, I met Cece
Drake this morning.

14:44.740 --> 14:46.173
Did you know that
she's back in town?

14:46.174 --> 14:47.474
I heard.

14:47.475 --> 14:49.810
I didn't even know that
she and Ali were friends.

14:49.811 --> 14:51.979
She said that you guys
spent an intense summer.

14:51.980 --> 14:54.148
Everything with Cece's intense.

14:55.183 --> 14:57.383
Did it end on a bad note?

15:00.254 --> 15:02.022
You could say that.

15:04.792 --> 15:07.493
Look, I got to, uh,
get home and take a shower.

15:07.494 --> 15:08.728
I'm gonna be late
for his plane.

15:08.729 --> 15:09.896
Okay.

15:17.470 --> 15:19.938
These are everywhere
in L.A. right now.

15:19.939 --> 15:22.875
Rachel Zoe practically gives
them out as business cards.

15:24.477 --> 15:26.712
Pretty.

15:26.713 --> 15:28.913
Next.
No, that's good.

15:28.914 --> 15:30.447
You're a lousy liar.

15:30.448 --> 15:31.949
Listen, handsome,
we just got in.

15:31.950 --> 15:33.617
Some killer vera scarves.

15:33.618 --> 15:35.753
Why don't you go pick out
a couple in your price range,

15:35.754 --> 15:38.022
and we'll pick the best.

15:41.426 --> 15:43.194
What's her name?

15:43.195 --> 15:45.395
It's obvious whoever
he's buying this gift for,

15:45.396 --> 15:47.197
you don't like.

15:47.198 --> 15:48.865
Jenna.

15:48.866 --> 15:52.169
And she got to him
before you did?

15:52.170 --> 15:53.770
Try again.

15:53.771 --> 15:55.471
You like him, right?

15:55.472 --> 15:57.741
We're just friends.

15:57.742 --> 16:00.010
And if you don't want to tap
that, you're either blind or...

16:00.011 --> 16:01.844
Ohh.

16:01.845 --> 16:03.112
You're thonone.

16:03.113 --> 16:05.414
The one what?

16:05.415 --> 16:08.450
With the giant crush on Ali.
She told you that?

16:08.451 --> 16:11.353
If you don't like him, then why
do you care if he's with Jenna?

16:11.354 --> 16:14.389
Is she a bitch or something?

16:14.390 --> 16:17.558
She's... something.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.028
Then you should tell him.

16:20.029 --> 16:21.963
You'd be doing him a favor.

16:21.964 --> 16:24.232
Emily, could you come
here for a second?

16:27.569 --> 16:30.404
Would you wear this?
No.

16:30.405 --> 16:32.240
But I'm not Jenna.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.674
Oh.
What about these?

16:34.675 --> 16:36.744
Maya had something like this.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.245
Yeah, she did.

16:38.246 --> 16:40.680
I got these a week before...

16:40.681 --> 16:42.850
How do you know she had these?

16:42.851 --> 16:44.384
I don't know.

16:44.385 --> 16:46.386
Must have been in a picture
she sent or something.

16:46.387 --> 16:47.955
What about this?

16:47.956 --> 16:50.356
How much are you wanting to spend?
You just met her.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.825
Would you quit
busting my chops?

16:52.826 --> 16:54.761
I wouldn't even be
buying her this gift.

16:54.762 --> 16:57.230
If the hottest girl
in rosewood was available,

16:57.231 --> 16:59.031
or interested in guys.

17:02.569 --> 17:05.871
You totally picked my favorite.

17:24.722 --> 17:26.556
Can I get you something?

17:26.557 --> 17:30.127
Uh, no. I'm supposed
to meet somebody here.

17:30.128 --> 17:31.395
You want something
while you wait?

17:31.396 --> 17:32.963
These just came
out of the oven.

17:32.964 --> 17:34.665
I can tell.

17:34.666 --> 17:36.267
I should have
skipped the perfume.

17:36.268 --> 17:38.268
And just worn one of those.
What are they?

17:38.269 --> 17:42.272
These are vanilla custard
and those are just butter.

17:42.273 --> 17:43.873
Nothing is just butter.

17:43.874 --> 17:46.910
I'll take a decaf, please.

17:46.911 --> 17:49.112
Is Emily here?

17:49.113 --> 17:51.747
Uh, not at the moment, no.

17:51.748 --> 17:53.448
Everyone abandoned me.

17:53.449 --> 17:55.217
I'm not usually out here.

17:57.954 --> 17:59.387
Emily's a sweet girl.
How do you know her?

17:59.388 --> 18:01.056
She's my daughter's
best friend.

18:01.057 --> 18:03.892
Oh, cool. Okay.
Yeah, she'll be back soon.

18:03.893 --> 18:05.527
That's too bad.

18:05.528 --> 18:10.131
I was hoping not to have a
first date in front of her.

18:10.132 --> 18:13.868
Ah. Ooh, yeah.
Those are never fun.

18:13.869 --> 18:16.738
It's basically a job
interview, without the forms.

18:16.739 --> 18:18.105
There were forms.

18:18.106 --> 18:20.107
Well, with any luck,

18:20.108 --> 18:22.143
he's not out of prison
just for the night.

18:22.144 --> 18:25.112
Thank you, 'cause I wasn't
really nervous before.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.551
Ella?

18:30.552 --> 18:32.720
Hi. Ted.

18:32.721 --> 18:34.888
Hello.

18:34.889 --> 18:37.358
Oh, you ordered already.

18:37.359 --> 18:39.393
Yeah, just a coffee.

18:39.394 --> 18:41.927
I passed that ice cream cart.

18:41.928 --> 18:44.630
The day's so nice, I thought...

18:44.631 --> 18:46.298
Oh! Yeah.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.568
Um, I just wanted a sip.

18:59.879 --> 19:01.546
Just settle down.

19:01.547 --> 19:03.382
I got you, Nicky.
Come on.

19:05.284 --> 19:07.352
Can I help you?

19:07.353 --> 19:10.154
Yeah, um,
I'm here to see someone.

19:10.155 --> 19:11.523
Mona vanderwaal?

19:11.524 --> 19:14.825
Well, let's see.

19:14.826 --> 19:16.494
Erer status has change,

19:16.495 --> 19:19.663
but I will need you to leave
your purse, your cellphone,

19:19.664 --> 19:21.832
any lighters or matches
you have...

19:21.833 --> 19:23.534
Oh, and those earrings.

19:29.707 --> 19:30.807
Your earrings.

19:31.876 --> 19:33.075
Oh.

19:36.146 --> 19:37.346
Thank you.

19:55.197 --> 19:56.998
Mona.

19:56.999 --> 19:58.700
You have a visitor.

20:02.003 --> 20:03.203
Hello, Aria.

20:10.446 --> 20:11.779
We need to talk.

20:15.317 --> 20:16.918
Her visits need
to be supervised,

20:16.919 --> 20:18.785
but you won't even
know I'm here.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.723
So...

20:23.724 --> 20:26.827
Would you like to play a game?

20:36.710 --> 20:40.284
You can't block a court order
in an afternoon. She needs time.

20:40.820 --> 20:43.054
But she'll do it?
She's gonna try.

20:43.055 --> 20:45.523
Try?! It's my mom.
With her, a try...

20:45.524 --> 20:48.058
Is as good as a win.
Just calm down.

20:48.059 --> 20:49.427
Did Aria get in to see Mona?

20:49.428 --> 20:51.329
I haven't heard anything yet.

20:54.833 --> 20:57.468
When did Alison's father
get back to rosewood?

21:00.038 --> 21:01.471
Today.

21:01.472 --> 21:03.740
Do you want me to talk to him?

21:03.741 --> 21:05.308
No.

21:05.309 --> 21:07.144
Well, maybe you should, han.

21:07.145 --> 21:09.345
You're believing everything
that wilden says.

21:09.346 --> 21:10.747
Why don't you find out
for yourself?

21:10.748 --> 21:11.848
'Cause I <i>can't.</i>

21:11.849 --> 21:13.516
And you know what?
You're right.

21:13.517 --> 21:17.319
Your mom's on it, so there's
no reason for me to panic.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.461
There are things
you need to know...

21:26.462 --> 21:28.396
About Jenna.

21:28.397 --> 21:29.564
Okay.

21:31.400 --> 21:35.470
Before you got here,
before a lot of things,

21:35.471 --> 21:37.172
Jenna dated Garrett.

21:37.173 --> 21:38.740
Garrett Reynolds.

21:38.741 --> 21:41.809
I wanted to tell you,
but I wasn't sure how.

21:41.810 --> 21:42.943
You seem so happy.

21:42.944 --> 21:45.612
No, you did the right thing.

21:45.613 --> 21:48.215
I really appreciate it.

21:48.216 --> 21:50.284
Wow.
Yeah.

21:50.285 --> 21:51.852
I mean, she could have
been his next victim.

21:51.853 --> 21:54.755
That's not exactly what I meant.
You don't have to worry.

21:54.756 --> 21:55.955
Jenna brings up Garrett,

21:55.956 --> 21:59.325
I won't let on
that you told me.

21:59.326 --> 22:01.327
But I'm glad you did.

22:01.328 --> 22:03.163
You're a good friend.

22:14.373 --> 22:17.209
I was there, so they
asked me to officiate.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.578
Mm. Sounds beautiful.

22:19.579 --> 22:20.713
It was.

22:20.714 --> 22:21.914
And soggy.

22:21.915 --> 22:23.716
If you're ever
in Phuket in September,

22:23.717 --> 22:26.018
bring an umbrella.

22:27.087 --> 22:30.988
What? What's wrong?

22:30.989 --> 22:32.724
Too much church talk, right?

22:32.725 --> 22:35.259
No, no, not at all.
I'm... I'm impressed.

22:35.260 --> 22:37.862
I mean, I've never met a
pastor who heard the call.

22:37.863 --> 22:39.630
While boogie-boarding
in Samoa.

22:39.631 --> 22:42.266
This is really good, huh?

22:42.267 --> 22:43.400
Mm-hmm.

22:55.980 --> 22:58.481
Mr. dilaurentis.

22:58.482 --> 22:59.882
Hanna.

23:03.253 --> 23:07.556
I thought about
writing you a letter and...

23:07.557 --> 23:10.793
I've gone over what to say
in head the past year,

23:10.794 --> 23:14.196
and... I just wanted
to say that I'm sorry.

23:14.197 --> 23:15.664
For what I did.

23:17.599 --> 23:19.801
You and urur family
were going through so much,

23:19.802 --> 23:21.569
and I didn't help.

23:21.570 --> 23:24.205
But I swear to you,

23:24.206 --> 23:27.909
I had nothing to do
with what's happening now.

23:27.910 --> 23:30.979
I didn't touch her grave,
and I would never.

23:30.980 --> 23:33.747
I mean, believe me, no one
wants to see Ali be at peace...

23:33.748 --> 23:36.250
Don't you...

23:36.251 --> 23:38.518
A friend would
never do what you did.

23:38.519 --> 23:41.554
At the time, it felt
like a childish prank.

23:43.124 --> 23:45.192
Seems like you've gotten
crueler with age.

23:53.300 --> 23:56.568
You need a good foundation.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.004
Start with a good foundation,

23:58.005 --> 24:00.006
and you can build anything.

24:02.209 --> 24:04.910
I'm sorry I came alone,
but Hanna couldn't make it.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.850
Lisa, isn't it time
for my medicine?

24:16.022 --> 24:20.025
You have about 25 seconds to
tell me why you're really here.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.526
Twenty-four, twenty-three...

24:21.527 --> 24:23.294
What Hanna buried wh alali...

24:23.295 --> 24:26.030
The planchette... showed up on
her kitchen counter today.

24:26.031 --> 24:28.399
Are you sure it was...?
Yes.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.100
How?

24:30.101 --> 24:33.070
It's not the only thing we've
gotten back from Ali's grave.

24:34.973 --> 24:38.007
Look, I know that
you don't like me.

24:38.008 --> 24:40.009
Trus m me,
the feeling is mutual.

24:40.010 --> 24:41.878
But think about Hanna.

24:41.879 --> 24:45.449
She's the reason you did
everything you did, right?

24:45.450 --> 24:48.017
She truly believed that at one
time your friendship was real.

24:48.018 --> 24:49.285
Our friendship <i>was</i> real.

24:49.286 --> 24:51.388
Okay, then if you care about
her... if you ever did...

24:51.389 --> 24:52.855
Please, Mona,

24:52.856 --> 24:54.790
please tell me who's
trying to hurt her.

24:54.791 --> 24:56.525
She's in trouble,
and I swear to you...

24:56.526 --> 24:58.227
I swear if you're
behind this...

24:58.228 --> 24:59.962
It isn't me.

24:59.963 --> 25:02.398
Here we go.
Visiting hours are over.

25:08.771 --> 25:10.405
Tell Hanna I'm sorry.

25:34.403 --> 25:36.437
You didn't have to come
all the way down here.

25:36.438 --> 25:38.573
What'd she say?

25:38.574 --> 25:41.475
Hardly anything. Her
visits are supervised now,

25:41.476 --> 25:44.612
but she wanted me to tell
you that she's sorry.

25:44.613 --> 25:47.581
Is it possible that maybe
she's not behind any of this?

25:47.582 --> 25:49.282
Either way, she knows who is.

25:49.283 --> 25:51.318
Hey. Visiting hours
are over.

25:51.319 --> 25:53.587
The nurses change shifts
in twenty minutes.

25:53.588 --> 25:56.289
What? I've been here
enough times to know.

25:56.290 --> 25:59.459
That's not what the look
is for. You're sneaking in.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.161
Hanna...

26:01.162 --> 26:03.196
I know that you're
freaked out about everything,

26:03.197 --> 26:04.964
but you could just
come back tomorrow.

26:04.965 --> 26:06.565
And do what?

26:06.566 --> 26:09.168
Have a nice chat
about "A" in the day room?

26:12.873 --> 26:14.506
Okay, then
I'm going with you.

26:14.507 --> 26:16.308
No! Aria, this...

26:16.309 --> 26:17.910
Hanna, friends
don't let friends.

26:17.911 --> 26:20.311
Sneak into
insane asylums alone.

26:45.403 --> 26:47.404
Hey.
Hey.

26:47.405 --> 26:48.973
So you deliver now?

26:48.974 --> 26:51.340
Oh, no, this is for me.

26:51.341 --> 26:53.176
Americano, straight.

26:53.177 --> 26:56.279
Well, the coffee, at least.

26:58.115 --> 27:00.950
So, did you talk to handsome?

27:00.951 --> 27:02.285
His name's Nate.

27:02.286 --> 27:03.653
That's not an answer.

27:03.654 --> 27:05.488
Yes, I did, but I
don't think it worked.

27:05.489 --> 27:07.389
In fact, I think he ended
up liking Jenna more.

27:07.390 --> 27:09.624
Well, at least you tried.

27:09.625 --> 27:12.060
That reminds me, I should
give you my number.

27:12.061 --> 27:13.228
Yeah.

27:14.597 --> 27:18.267
So, uh, do you see Ali's
big brother around much?

27:18.268 --> 27:20.735
He's around.

27:20.736 --> 27:22.671
Is he single?

27:22.672 --> 27:23.805
Yeah.

27:24.873 --> 27:27.341
How long did you...?

27:27.342 --> 27:28.676
Hi, is this Jenna?

27:28.677 --> 27:31.045
The better question
is, who the hell are you,

27:31.046 --> 27:33.547
and why are you going out
with my boyfriend? Whoa!

27:33.548 --> 27:35.783
Oh, you didn't? 'Cause I
think that you <i>did</i> know,

27:35.784 --> 27:37.018
and just didn't care.

27:37.019 --> 27:38.885
Please stop.
Here's what I know:

27:38.886 --> 27:41.387
If I ever see you
anywhere near Nate,

27:41.388 --> 27:44.524
I will scratch your eyes out.

27:44.525 --> 27:46.559
What are you doing?

27:46.560 --> 27:48.361
She used to be blind.

27:48.362 --> 27:49.996
Ohh...!

27:49.997 --> 27:52.265
Well, it needed to be done.

27:52.266 --> 27:53.766
It's not like
we shot a unicorn...

27:53.767 --> 27:55.334
We're helping your friend out.

27:55.335 --> 27:56.702
I know, but...

27:56.703 --> 27:58.137
Do you want me
to call her back,

27:58.138 --> 28:01.073
tell her that I was kidding?

28:01.074 --> 28:03.174
That's what I thought.

28:03.175 --> 28:05.544
Problem solved.

28:05.545 --> 28:07.546
See you around, americano.

28:25.864 --> 28:27.598
Hey, you're back!

28:27.599 --> 28:30.968
Uh, yeah, actually this time
I am looking for Emily.

28:30.969 --> 28:33.003
I was trying to get
in touch with my daughter.

28:33.004 --> 28:34.738
And thought Emily might
know where she is.

28:34.739 --> 28:36.940
Just missed her.
How'd the date go?

28:36.941 --> 28:40.377
Uh... it was fine.

28:40.378 --> 28:43.646
But there's not gonna
be another one.

28:43.647 --> 28:44.915
We'll see.

28:44.916 --> 28:47.251
Well...

28:47.252 --> 28:48.585
Tell you what.

28:48.586 --> 28:53.722
Just so the night ends
on a sweet note,

28:53.723 --> 28:54.891
here.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.261
We can't sell
day-old pastry.

28:58.262 --> 29:02.564
You can't sell pastries
to people my age at all.

29:02.565 --> 29:04.700
What's wrong with your age?

29:07.036 --> 29:10.205
Thank you. Um... and I
will take these to go.

29:10.206 --> 29:12.774
Your choice.
You can stay, if you want.

29:12.775 --> 29:16.144
Mmm... aren't you closing?

29:16.145 --> 29:19.680
Well, we close
when I want to close.

29:19.681 --> 29:21.383
Ownership has its privileges.

29:23.684 --> 29:26.153
You own this place?
Mm-hmm.

29:26.154 --> 29:28.722
I'm Zack.

29:28.723 --> 29:30.657
Apron fooled you, huh?

29:42.636 --> 29:44.537
Wait out here, all right?

29:44.538 --> 29:46.039
Make sure no one comes.

29:58.318 --> 30:00.018
Hanna?

30:00.019 --> 30:02.921
What are you doing here?
Is everything okay?

30:02.922 --> 30:05.623
Well, I'm being set up
for killing a friend, Mona.

30:05.624 --> 30:07.159
What do you think?

30:07.160 --> 30:09.094
God, you poor thing!

30:09.095 --> 30:11.028
You know what?
Save it, Mona.

30:11.029 --> 30:13.497
Alison's dad's back.

30:13.498 --> 30:16.267
Yeah. And you're the
only person who knows.

30:16.268 --> 30:19.070
Why he's never forgiven me.

30:19.071 --> 30:21.339
Who else knows about
the night I saw Alison?

30:25.310 --> 30:27.043
Nurse was coming.

30:27.044 --> 30:28.878
What is <i>she</i> doing back here?

30:28.879 --> 30:30.480
She never left.

30:30.481 --> 30:32.215
You need to give her
some answers, so talk.

30:33.817 --> 30:35.485
Can I?

30:35.486 --> 30:37.820
Does she know about that day?

30:37.821 --> 30:39.655
Know about what?
Cut it out, all right?

30:39.656 --> 30:41.024
That's not why I'm here.

30:41.025 --> 30:42.824
Is he really still mad at you?

30:42.825 --> 30:46.295
Who? What... Hanna, what the
hell is she talking about?

30:46.296 --> 30:48.530
I won't say anything
if you don't want me to.

30:48.531 --> 30:50.299
Say something about what?

30:51.401 --> 30:53.002
You just take.

30:53.003 --> 30:55.004
The first letter of each word
to spell out a new word.

30:55.005 --> 30:58.806
So, like, "she lives
under trees" equals "slut."

30:58.807 --> 31:01.075
What?
It's a code...

31:01.076 --> 31:04.312
So we can talk about people
right in front of them.

31:06.248 --> 31:08.416
Look, I'm sorry, Mona,

31:08.417 --> 31:10.485
I'm just really not
in the mood right now.

31:10.486 --> 31:14.254
I know, but I thought it might help
you take your mind off things.

31:20.895 --> 31:22.962
Do you have <i>any</i> idea?

31:22.963 --> 31:24.597
Dad, don't! Do you know
what your little joke...

31:24.598 --> 31:26.633
Did to my wife?
She believed you!

31:26.634 --> 31:29.002
You gave her hope!

31:29.003 --> 31:30.802
Stay away from my family!

31:30.803 --> 31:33.472
Dad, dad, come on, let's go.

31:33.473 --> 31:34.973
How could you?

31:42.749 --> 31:44.716
The night that I saw
Alison on my patio,

31:44.717 --> 31:45.984
I called Mrs. dilaurentis.

31:45.985 --> 31:49.421
And I told her she was alive.

31:50.689 --> 31:53.724
Then, three days later,
they found her body.

31:55.428 --> 31:57.762
Look, he still <i>hates</i> me.

31:57.763 --> 32:00.498
I could just feel it.
He's never forgiven me.

32:00.499 --> 32:03.500
Another stupid mistake
"A" can use to ruin my life.

32:08.606 --> 32:12.042
Where the hell is Mona?

32:12.043 --> 32:14.611
Please tell me you
still have your keys.

32:34.630 --> 32:35.763
Jason.

32:45.241 --> 32:47.375
Jason.

32:47.376 --> 32:49.511
Jason!

32:49.512 --> 32:50.877
Jason.

32:50.878 --> 32:53.880
Hey, are you okay?

32:53.881 --> 32:55.516
Jason, are you drunk?

32:57.486 --> 33:01.122
Stop it. The police are gonna
be here any minute, okay?

33:01.123 --> 33:03.324
Maybe they'll lock me
up with Garrett.

33:03.325 --> 33:04.891
Finally get some justice.

33:04.892 --> 33:06.859
Just move over.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.162
What?
I said move over!

33:09.163 --> 33:10.497
Why?

33:10.498 --> 33:13.500
Because this never happened.

33:13.501 --> 33:15.135
Come on.

33:46.147 --> 33:48.815
Oh, I'm going to twist
Mona's head off.

33:48.816 --> 33:52.084
I know, but first
we have to find her.

33:52.085 --> 33:54.053
You don't think she's
still "A", do you?

33:56.891 --> 33:59.926
That... that door,
it's always closed.

33:59.927 --> 34:04.564
Children's ward.
Dedicated 1931.

34:04.565 --> 34:06.298
Do you think she went in there?

34:10.803 --> 34:12.571
Those are mine.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.206
You gave tweezers
to a mental patient?

34:15.206 --> 34:16.708
Of course not!

34:16.708 --> 34:19.878
She probably stole them.

34:19.879 --> 34:21.346
Come on.

34:31.155 --> 34:32.856
Hey.
Hey.

34:32.857 --> 34:36.359
What... what took you so long? Can
you give me a ride to my car?

34:36.360 --> 34:38.428
It's not here? No, we
need to hurry, please.

34:38.429 --> 34:39.963
What? What's going on?

34:39.964 --> 34:42.599
I-I had
to give Jason a ride.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.367
You're chasing down
another tip.

34:44.368 --> 34:47.235
No, it's not like that. Well,
then tell me what it <i>is</i> like...

34:47.237 --> 34:48.871
Because you're not being...

34:48.871 --> 34:50.906
Spencer, what's happening?

34:56.080 --> 34:57.846
So you are home.

34:57.847 --> 35:00.183
What are you doing here?

35:00.184 --> 35:02.384
We found your vehicle
near the scene of an accident.

35:02.385 --> 35:03.785
Your door was wide open.

35:03.786 --> 35:07.289
Well, I'm fine,

35:07.290 --> 35:09.057
if that's what you mean.

35:10.659 --> 35:12.860
But you didn't report
your car stolen.

35:12.861 --> 35:16.064
We've been here
all night, detective.

35:16.065 --> 35:19.133
I picked her up
after work today.

35:19.134 --> 35:20.701
How many times do I
have to tell you.

35:20.702 --> 35:22.570
To lock your doors, Spence?

35:22.571 --> 35:24.438
It's not the 1950s.

35:24.439 --> 35:26.873
Yeah. He's right.

35:26.874 --> 35:29.076
It's such a terrible habit.

35:31.946 --> 35:34.347
We'll talk later.

35:42.055 --> 35:45.325
What was that about? I told you,
I needed to give Jason a ride.

35:45.326 --> 35:48.261
And you just happened to leave your
car at the scene of a hit-and-run?

35:48.262 --> 35:51.463
I just lied to the police. There
was an accident, that's all.

35:51.464 --> 35:54.299
Accidents don't need to
be kept from the cops.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.668
Jason was drunk, okay?

35:58.171 --> 36:02.441
Spencer, I felt like I was
finally done with the police.

36:02.442 --> 36:04.943
That lie...
It's a felony.

36:04.944 --> 36:07.911
I understand that, okay?
And I'm sorry.

36:07.912 --> 36:10.448
But if jasonetets caught,
he could lose everything.

36:10.449 --> 36:15.753
You can't tell anybody.
Please promise me.

36:38.875 --> 36:40.509
Do you hear that?

36:58.661 --> 37:00.562
They used to put
kids down here?

37:02.164 --> 37:03.931
Wait over there.

37:28.755 --> 37:30.489
What is she doing?

37:32.759 --> 37:36.662
Miss Aria, you're a
killer, not ezra's wife.

37:36.663 --> 37:38.698
Miss Aria, you're a
killer, not ezra's wife.

37:38.699 --> 37:41.100
Cut it out, Mona.

37:42.702 --> 37:44.402
Where were we?

37:44.403 --> 37:46.904
Maya's away, sleeping sweet.

37:46.905 --> 37:49.507
Until Garrett's
all rosy, count on me.

37:49.508 --> 37:51.743
- Where were we?
- Mona?

37:51.744 --> 37:53.811
Somebody's coming.

37:53.812 --> 37:55.913
Look, Mona, I am begging you,

37:55.914 --> 37:58.116
if you know anything
about what's happening to us,

37:58.117 --> 37:59.784
can you just tell me, please?

38:02.121 --> 38:04.521
No one to save Ali from evil.

38:04.522 --> 38:06.457
No one to save Ali from evil.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.392
Mona, is that you?

38:08.393 --> 38:09.894
Hanna, we have to get
out of here now.

38:14.866 --> 38:17.000
Mona? There you are.

38:18.803 --> 38:21.071
It's time to go now, honey.

38:21.072 --> 38:23.406
No.

38:23.407 --> 38:24.574
Come.

38:27.879 --> 38:29.846
I missed my dolls.

38:29.847 --> 38:32.547
They're not going anywhere.
Come now.

38:37.187 --> 38:38.788
Where were we?

38:38.789 --> 38:40.823
Maya's away, sleeping sweet.

38:40.824 --> 38:43.259
Until Garrett's
all rosy, count on me.

38:43.260 --> 38:44.660
Where were we?

38:54.204 --> 38:56.605
Did you get my message?
Where were you?

38:56.606 --> 38:59.508
Uh, I had to help
Hanna with something.

38:59.509 --> 39:00.775
Where are you?

39:00.776 --> 39:03.379
At the brew.
You're still on your date?

39:03.380 --> 39:05.880
No, not that one, but, um...

39:07.983 --> 39:10.418
I think I may be
on a second one.

39:10.419 --> 39:13.454
Hold on. What happened
to the first one?

39:13.455 --> 39:14.755
It ended.

39:14.756 --> 39:17.158
I mean, it was nice, but...

39:17.159 --> 39:20.361
He ate ice
cream like your father.

39:20.362 --> 39:22.195
He scraped the sides.

39:22.196 --> 39:23.963
And left a big mound
in theididdle?

39:23.964 --> 39:25.298
Yes!

39:25.299 --> 39:28.601
Mom! Come on, that's not
a reason to end a date.

39:28.602 --> 39:30.970
<i>I know, it's not.</i>
<i>You're right.</i>

39:30.971 --> 39:33.173
And he's perfectly lovely,
and I can totally see.

39:33.174 --> 39:35.542
Why the website linked us up.

39:35.543 --> 39:37.276
'Kay, what's the problem, then?

39:37.277 --> 39:39.345
Problem is,
there is no problem.

39:39.346 --> 39:40.846
He's the right choice.

39:40.847 --> 39:42.581
He's the choice
I would have made at 19,

39:42.582 --> 39:45.817
but I think I... maybe
should be open to more...

39:45.818 --> 39:47.353
Possibilities.

39:47.354 --> 39:48.687
I don't believe this.

39:48.688 --> 39:51.924
Mom, two dates in one night?

39:51.925 --> 39:54.659
Yeah, you are definitely
wearing a scarf next time.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.528
I'm done with scarves.

39:56.529 --> 39:57.995
<i>Do you want them?</i>

39:57.996 --> 39:59.264
Mom, can we just...

39:59.265 --> 40:01.499
Can we talk about this
tomorrow? I'm exhausted.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.001
God! You used to be
so much more fun.

40:04.002 --> 40:07.505
And then I grew up.
Go to bed, mom.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.412
What's up
with your mom?

40:15.413 --> 40:17.615
She's a slut.
Let's just go to sleep.

41:11.767 --> 41:13.001
<i>Where were we?</i>

41:13.002 --> 41:14.468
<i>Maya's away, sleeping sweet.</i>

41:14.469 --> 41:17.638
Until Garrett's all rosy,
<i>count on me.</i>

41:17.639 --> 41:19.072
A code?

41:19.073 --> 41:21.108
It's a stupid thing she made
up back when we were friends.

41:21.109 --> 41:22.843
Why wouldn't she just
come out and say it?

41:22.844 --> 41:24.778
Because Aria was there.

41:24.779 --> 41:25.979
She doesn't trust her.

41:25.980 --> 41:27.181
So it's my fault?

41:27.182 --> 41:28.882
You gave the girl
a pair of tweezers.

41:28.883 --> 41:32.084
Look, Mona pushed me to remember
that day with Ali's dad.

41:32.085 --> 41:33.719
Because that's when
she gave me the code.

41:33.720 --> 41:35.588
Okay, I have a French
exam at eight A.M.

41:35.589 --> 41:37.657
Could we just skip ahead
to the actual message?

41:37.658 --> 41:40.326
"No one to save Ali
from evil."

41:40.327 --> 41:42.028
That's what she kept saying.

41:42.029 --> 41:44.730
If you take the first letter
of each word, you get...

41:44.731 --> 41:46.032
"Not safe."

41:49.202 --> 41:52.437
It's not, like, that complicated.
Yeah, but there's more.

41:52.438 --> 41:54.039
Oh, my God,
what's that other poem?

41:54.040 --> 41:56.208
Something about
Garrett and Maya.

41:56.209 --> 41:59.444
"Where were we? Maya's
away, sleeping sweet."

41:59.445 --> 42:01.213
Www.Mass.

42:01.214 --> 42:03.314
She gave you a website.

42:03.315 --> 42:04.782
What was the stst?

42:04.783 --> 42:07.318
"Until Garrett's
all rosy, count on me."

42:07.319 --> 42:10.587
"Mas sugar"?
What does that mean?

42:10.588 --> 42:12.156
M-a-s,
that's Maya's initials.

42:12.157 --> 42:13.590
Anne was her middle name.

42:22.767 --> 42:26.936
I don't suppose crazy slipped
you the password as well?

42:30.373 --> 42:32.942
Did Mona mean she's not safe,

42:32.943 --> 42:34.577
or we're not?

43:25.425 --> 43:28.693
<i>Somebody's coming.</i>

43:28.694 --> 43:30.763
<i>Look, Mona,</i>
<i>i am begging you.</i>

43:30.764 --> 43:33.165
<i>If you know anything</i>
<i>about what's happening to you,</i>

43:33.166 --> 43:35.100
<i>could you just tell me, please?</i>

43:35.101 --> 43:36.802
<i>No one to save</i>
<i>Ali from evil.</i>

43:36.803 --> 43:38.804
No one to save Ali from evil.

43:38.805 --> 43:40.773
No one to save Ali from evil.

43:40.796 --> 43:45.816
