00:18.471 --> 00:20.491
I thought he was supposed
to have a breakfast date, right?

00:20.640 --> 00:22.326
I mean, they told me
that last night.

00:22.475 --> 00:24.495
Breakfast?
Is that on the sched?

00:24.643 --> 00:25.830
It isn't,
but the lieutenant told me

00:25.977 --> 00:27.498
that he'd be doing
breakfast with someone

00:27.646 --> 00:28.999
down at the harbor.

00:29.146 --> 00:30.167
I mean, if he ain't,

00:30.314 --> 00:32.769
I could go get this gassed up
at the Fallsway.

00:32.917 --> 00:35.271
I hate this detail, man.

00:35.419 --> 00:38.474
It's off duty.
Lotsa perks.

00:38.621 --> 00:43.011
All this stand around
and wait, you know?

00:43.159 --> 00:45.013
Hoskins says
I do the one year,

00:45.161 --> 00:46.848
and I'll make sergeant
on the next list.

00:46.995 --> 00:49.017
Yeah. They told me,
careerwise,

00:49.164 --> 00:50.518
you can't do better
than drive the mayor.

00:50.666 --> 00:52.353
Shit, if you could
make rank the right way,

00:52.501 --> 00:54.765
I'll still be working
Western drugs.

01:05.946 --> 01:06.966
All right, fuck this,

01:07.113 --> 01:08.600
I'm gonna go look
for the lieutenant.

01:08.748 --> 01:09.635
Anyone comes looking,

01:09.783 --> 01:12.445
I'm back up
on the second floor.

01:19.291 --> 01:20.311
Sir?

01:20.459 --> 01:21.479
I understood
that the mayor

01:21.626 --> 01:24.147
might be going to, uh,
breakfast at the harbor?

01:24.295 --> 01:25.649
With Kweisi.

01:25.797 --> 01:27.984
But, um, that's up
in the air, I thought.

01:28.132 --> 01:31.465
Would you happen to know
where Lieutenant Hoskins is?

01:54.722 --> 01:56.315
Sir?

02:04.264 --> 02:05.754
Lieutenant?

02:07.934 --> 02:09.264
Umm...

04:19.916 --> 04:22.438
You don't look happy,
Detective.

04:22.586 --> 04:26.108
We're about
to raise some hell.

04:26.255 --> 04:29.111
Maybe too much hell.

04:29.258 --> 04:32.480
A state senator,
two councilmen,

04:32.628 --> 04:34.382
the City Development Agency,

04:34.530 --> 04:35.917
all those developers...

04:36.065 --> 04:37.117
Princes of the city.

04:37.266 --> 04:39.119
Lester, tell me
the thought hasn't

04:39.267 --> 04:40.621
crossed your mind
that some kinda shit

04:40.769 --> 04:42.556
could blow
back on us, man.

04:42.704 --> 04:44.290
Do you know what
Theodore Roosevelt said

04:44.439 --> 04:46.960
about hunting grizzly bears?

04:47.107 --> 04:50.029
The thrill is in overcoming
your own fear.

04:50.177 --> 04:52.371
What was the thrill
for the bear?

04:55.616 --> 04:57.136
I should've run every one
of these subpoenas

04:57.283 --> 04:58.169
by my front office.

04:58.317 --> 04:59.638
That's not procedure.

04:59.786 --> 05:02.539
Fuck procedure, Lester.

05:02.688 --> 05:04.074
My boss is running
two points behind

05:04.222 --> 05:06.377
in the polls with
the mayor's support.

05:06.525 --> 05:07.411
How do you think
he's gonna do

05:07.559 --> 05:08.579
if he pisses off Royce

05:08.727 --> 05:10.080
and starts dropping off
incumbent tickets?

05:10.227 --> 05:12.683
Why do you care?

05:12.830 --> 05:15.752
If Demper thinks
I fucked him and he wins,

05:15.900 --> 05:19.087
I will be at Central Booking
covering bail reviews.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.423
If he loses to Bond,

05:20.570 --> 05:22.090
a new front office comes
in and maybe they bounce

05:22.238 --> 05:23.792
the white girl
back to a trial team

05:23.940 --> 05:25.927
and give the Narcotics Division
to one of their own.

05:26.074 --> 05:28.429
It's Baltimore, Lester.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.598
We're missing
a couple of subpoenas.

05:30.746 --> 05:32.236
We are?

05:33.414 --> 05:37.104
Clay Davis
and Andy Krawczyk.

05:37.251 --> 05:39.105
I'm holding those
till October.

05:39.253 --> 05:40.607
Oh, the hell you are.

05:40.755 --> 05:41.741
Lester...

05:41.888 --> 05:44.109
we drop subpoenas
on either of those guys

05:44.258 --> 05:45.944
three weeks
before the primary,

05:46.093 --> 05:47.614
and all hell breaks loose.

05:47.761 --> 05:49.381
That's what I'm sayin'!

05:49.529 --> 05:52.284
Clay Davis is Royce's
deputy campaign chairman,

05:52.432 --> 05:55.119
and the number-two man at
the City Legislative Caucus.

05:55.267 --> 05:57.388
And Krawczyk is his
number-one fundraiser!

05:57.536 --> 05:59.557
You're giving me resumes
and job titles.

05:59.704 --> 06:01.459
I'm just following the money.

06:01.607 --> 06:04.728
And we will follow it...
after the polls close.

06:04.876 --> 06:06.897
We can drop a second batch
of subpoenas.

06:07.045 --> 06:09.865
There is no reason to do
this now and risk--

06:10.014 --> 06:12.401
A year ago, if we had gone
after these records,

06:12.550 --> 06:14.737
City Hall would've
stomped on this unit

06:14.885 --> 06:16.405
and the subpoenas.

06:16.553 --> 06:19.908
And a month from now,
after Royce is reelected,

06:20.057 --> 06:22.377
they'll do us
the same way.

06:22.525 --> 06:26.647
But right now,
with the primary coming,

06:26.796 --> 06:28.415
they gotta worry
about how they look,

06:28.563 --> 06:30.360
how they behave.

06:31.566 --> 06:35.229
Right now, they gotta
worry about scandal.

06:38.405 --> 06:40.259
You told me you wanted
to do this a year ago,

06:40.407 --> 06:43.069
but fresh cases
got in the way.

06:46.246 --> 06:48.646
You told me that.

06:50.016 --> 06:52.771
Oh.

06:52.918 --> 06:55.272
Very clever, Lester.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.842
You got it all figured, huh?

06:57.990 --> 07:00.778
Me?

07:00.925 --> 07:03.689
I'm just the police.

07:06.197 --> 07:08.885
I saw the teachers' union
finally endorsed Royce.

07:09.032 --> 07:11.227
You knew
they were gonna.

07:17.039 --> 07:18.894
What time's
your first appearance?

07:19.041 --> 07:20.062
Today?

07:20.209 --> 07:22.897
I meet up with you guys
at the SoWeBo forum.

07:23.045 --> 07:25.233
And tonight, it's me
and the kids next to Tommy

07:25.380 --> 07:28.042
at the Roland Park fundraiser.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.076
Better speed things along.

07:37.225 --> 07:40.057
A kick in the ass
sometimes helps.

07:41.395 --> 07:45.917
- B-5?
- No, Daddy, D-5.

07:46.065 --> 07:47.752
You sure
you didn't say B-5?

07:47.900 --> 07:50.588
D-5.
What did I hit?

07:50.736 --> 07:52.225
Submarine.

07:54.073 --> 07:56.593
Umm...

07:56.741 --> 07:58.595
E-6.

07:58.743 --> 08:00.074
Miss.

08:03.347 --> 08:04.534
Just gimme 10 minutes.

08:04.683 --> 08:05.868
You seen your
schedule today?

08:06.016 --> 08:07.203
You ain't got
10 minutes.

08:07.351 --> 08:09.372
Norman, I got
this pretty girl's

08:09.519 --> 08:11.206
aircraft carrier boxed in.

08:11.354 --> 08:15.210
- D-4.
- Ow! Hit.

08:15.358 --> 08:16.878
Tommy,
for Christ's sakes.

08:17.025 --> 08:19.147
Is there any way
that I can win?

08:19.294 --> 08:21.549
With the numbers what they are,
is there any way at all?

08:21.697 --> 08:24.051
Right, so if it's just a matter
of playing out the string,

08:24.198 --> 08:25.219
then that's what
I'm gonna do.

08:25.366 --> 08:26.719
That game's pretty much
over, Norman.

08:26.868 --> 08:29.756
But this game--
this game right here--

08:29.904 --> 08:32.530
this one could still
go either way.

08:34.374 --> 08:35.395
H-11,
sweetheart.

08:35.542 --> 08:37.135
Miss. D-3.

09:27.355 --> 09:30.042
So I guess y'all getting
what y'all need?

09:30.190 --> 09:32.711
- Brianna keepin' y'all close?
- She come up with it.

09:32.860 --> 09:35.214
Money comin' through
every month like she say.

09:35.361 --> 09:37.782
A'ight, 'cause I'm standin'
tall up in here.

09:37.930 --> 09:39.584
They don't need
to worry about me

09:39.732 --> 09:41.218
an' I ain't need
to worry about them.

09:41.367 --> 09:44.200
- You a soldier, Bey.
- You know it.

09:45.871 --> 09:48.492
Everything all right
with my fishes?

09:48.640 --> 09:50.194
You'd tell me if
it wasn't, right?

09:50.341 --> 09:53.229
The fish be fine.
I mean, they fish, right?

09:53.378 --> 09:55.064
How I know how they
feelin' about shit?

09:55.212 --> 09:57.066
- De'londa...
- They fine, Bey.

09:57.214 --> 09:58.734
Ask Namond.

09:58.883 --> 10:00.569
Cleaned the tank an' all,
like you say.

10:00.718 --> 10:03.572
- Cleaned the filter, too.
- A'ight, a'ight.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.706
Check you out, though.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.074
Getting some fuzz
up there, huh?

10:07.223 --> 10:09.144
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, whatever.

10:09.291 --> 10:10.778
I know when I was
a little kid, boy,

10:10.927 --> 10:12.647
I couldn't wait till
I started shaving.

10:12.795 --> 10:14.315
One of the old heads
on the corner say,

10:14.463 --> 10:17.084
"Hey, little man,
you wanna grow a 'stache?

10:17.231 --> 10:18.752
Next time
you take a piss,

10:18.900 --> 10:19.921
take some of that piss,

10:20.068 --> 10:21.254
get it on
your fingertips,

10:21.401 --> 10:22.455
do like this, here."

10:22.603 --> 10:23.923
Eww! You do it?

10:24.072 --> 10:26.091
You damn right I did it.

10:26.239 --> 10:27.426
Shit.

10:27.574 --> 10:29.295
What's going on with you,
though, son?

10:29.443 --> 10:32.830
Ain't nothing.
School about to start.

10:32.979 --> 10:34.666
So what about Bodie
and his boys?

10:34.815 --> 10:36.501
They treatin' you right?

10:36.649 --> 10:38.102
Yeah, he cool.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.638
Boy, don't lie
to your father.

10:40.785 --> 10:43.840
He don't even show up for work
half the damn time.

10:43.989 --> 10:46.743
- Bodie told me.
- I missed a few days. That's all, Dad.

10:46.891 --> 10:47.778
And what money
you do make,

10:47.926 --> 10:49.378
you waste on nonsense.

10:49.527 --> 10:51.448
And if you think
I'm gonna give you a dime

10:51.595 --> 10:54.650
for your school clothes,
you better think again.

10:54.798 --> 10:56.352
What Bodie
got you doin'?

10:56.500 --> 10:57.653
I'm a runner,
most days.

10:57.801 --> 10:59.455
Everybody got
to start somewhere.

10:59.602 --> 11:01.589
You better listen
to your father.

11:01.737 --> 11:04.426
He ain't tell you 'bout
that hair, though, huh?

11:04.574 --> 11:06.661
Yeah, he said
I gotta get it cut.

11:06.808 --> 11:07.895
I like it this way.

11:08.044 --> 11:09.129
Even the white police
lookin' out from

11:09.277 --> 11:10.864
three blocks away gonna
be able to spot you

11:11.012 --> 11:12.833
from every other nigga
out there.

11:12.981 --> 11:14.834
They gonna hop out and say,
"Look at the boy over there

11:14.983 --> 11:17.637
with the pretty-ass
ponytail. Get him."

11:17.786 --> 11:19.639
You think
I'm bullshitting.

11:19.787 --> 11:22.741
Either you real out there,
or you ain't, Nay.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.050
You see what I'm sayin'?

11:31.563 --> 11:32.917
Let me get some!

11:33.066 --> 11:34.385
Hey, yo! Over here!

11:34.533 --> 11:36.364
- Whoa! $100!
- Thanks, mister!

11:37.736 --> 11:40.068
- Thank you, Mr. Marlo!
- Thank you!

11:46.577 --> 11:48.738
That's my money, yo!

11:54.584 --> 11:57.576
Your name gonna
ring out, man.

12:00.189 --> 12:02.180
Manuel...

12:12.533 --> 12:14.053
Boy, you talk that shit
better'n me

12:14.202 --> 12:16.455
and I been dealin' with
these Mexicans for years now.

12:16.604 --> 12:17.723
Yeah, I don't think
they would call

12:17.871 --> 12:19.558
what I'm speakin'
Spanish, man.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.560
Just a dirty word
or two here or there.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.729
Yeah, well. Once you can
talk to these cats,

12:23.876 --> 12:26.231
the only thing you need
then is a truck, man.

12:26.380 --> 12:27.499
Could be runnin'
your own crew,

12:27.647 --> 12:29.501
pickin' up fresh clients.

12:29.648 --> 12:31.069
I mean,
if we put in together

12:31.216 --> 12:32.637
we could be coverin'
twice the ground,

12:32.784 --> 12:34.338
makin' twice as much.

12:34.486 --> 12:37.908
Nah, man, I got
other obligations.

12:38.056 --> 12:39.176
Oh, right.

12:39.324 --> 12:41.878
You set to be
the new Angelo Dundee.

12:42.026 --> 12:43.585
I near forgot.

12:51.568 --> 12:52.755
I thought
you already went up

12:52.902 --> 12:54.923
to Mondawmin to get
your school shit, man.

12:55.071 --> 12:56.590
Yeah,
but not all of it.

12:56.739 --> 12:57.758
And my boy,

12:57.907 --> 12:58.926
he need to pay
for his own shit

12:59.074 --> 13:00.228
and his little brother, too.

13:00.375 --> 13:01.262
The fuck this look like,

13:01.410 --> 13:03.197
a Social Services office?

13:03.345 --> 13:04.832
You want a check,
go the fuck up Rosemont.

13:04.980 --> 13:06.412
Come on, man,
I'll work for it.

13:07.848 --> 13:10.370
Nay, I took you on outta respect
for your father,

13:10.518 --> 13:12.038
a'ight, but I can't go hirin'

13:12.186 --> 13:14.173
the whole damn neighborhood.

13:14.321 --> 13:15.208
You can have
my job until

13:15.355 --> 13:17.042
you get enough
for you an' Bug.

13:17.190 --> 13:20.446
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, work for y'all, work for me, yo.

13:20.594 --> 13:22.823
Po-po.
Step the fuck off.

13:32.538 --> 13:34.124
Looking for your man Lex.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.326
I see his broom,
but I don't see him.

13:36.474 --> 13:37.961
Where's your
number two been at?

13:38.109 --> 13:40.797
- I ain't seen him.
- Since when?

13:40.944 --> 13:43.265
I thought we were
on better terms.

13:43.413 --> 13:44.400
Or do you want me
rolling past

13:44.548 --> 13:46.569
Iookin' for Lex
every 15 minutes?

13:46.716 --> 13:48.581
He come past,
I'll call you.

13:49.685 --> 13:50.777
I will!

14:05.666 --> 14:07.999
If he come past.

14:09.169 --> 14:11.023
Oh no, I don't know.

14:11.171 --> 14:12.859
They're spinning
their wheels.

14:13.006 --> 14:14.559
You know,
poor Tony Gray,

14:14.707 --> 14:17.362
pulling 20%
of the black vote.

14:17.511 --> 14:19.864
It's embarrassing.

14:20.013 --> 14:21.032
Well, who knows
what the fuck

14:21.180 --> 14:22.367
Carcetti's
trying to prove?

14:22.514 --> 14:24.135
But I tell you,
at the end of this thing,

14:24.284 --> 14:26.871
he's gonna regret getting
on the wrong side of me.

14:27.019 --> 14:28.204
Mm-hmm.

14:28.353 --> 14:31.875
A'ight, now.
I got what you need, boy,

14:32.024 --> 14:34.377
clean tees,
any sizes, huh?

14:34.525 --> 14:36.179
Lookin' for socks, briefs,

14:36.326 --> 14:38.981
you lookin' for dice,
Zippos, cards--

14:39.130 --> 14:41.050
come on over
to the Rollin' Emporium.

14:41.197 --> 14:42.384
You ain't gotta
walk to Rite-Aid.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.219
Shit, Rite-Aid
comin' to y'all.

14:44.367 --> 14:45.586
What can I get you, baby?

14:45.735 --> 14:47.389
Fresh dice
an' a pack of Trojans.

14:47.536 --> 14:49.724
- All righty.
- You got Philly Blunts, too?

14:49.873 --> 14:50.892
Bubbles got it all, dawg.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.860
I'm the one-stop shop.

14:53.007 --> 14:55.396
- How much is that?
- Six an' a bit.

14:55.543 --> 14:57.397
Thank you.
Thank you kindly.

14:57.545 --> 14:59.166
Yes, sir, I see
what you're lookin' at.

14:59.314 --> 15:00.800
Two a deck,
name brand.

15:00.948 --> 15:01.835
You can't beat that price.

15:01.983 --> 15:04.104
Yeah, let me get
two decks, man,

15:04.252 --> 15:06.372
and a white tee,
double-X.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.940
And give me the rest
of them paint cans, too, man.

15:08.088 --> 15:11.010
All right, all right,
there you go. That's it?

15:11.158 --> 15:13.178
Yeah, what's that?

15:13.327 --> 15:15.658
How much the man owe,
Sherrod?

15:22.834 --> 15:24.354
- 13.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

15:24.503 --> 15:26.023
He asked for all the cans.

15:26.171 --> 15:28.298
Three cans is $12,
plus the other stuff.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.027
It's $19.
$19, sir.

15:31.175 --> 15:32.195
Come on, you still gettin'
off with a deal,

15:32.343 --> 15:33.863
Now, you didn't have
to move your feet.

15:34.011 --> 15:35.031
We came to you, right?

15:35.179 --> 15:38.342
My bad.
$19, like he said.

15:39.515 --> 15:40.535
Thank you very much.

15:40.683 --> 15:42.938
He's an intern,
I'm working with him.

15:43.086 --> 15:46.374
But, ma'am,
what I'm asking is

15:46.522 --> 15:49.710
when was the last time
you saw Lex?

15:49.858 --> 15:52.713
Oh, excuse me-- Curtis?

15:52.861 --> 15:54.294
Hmm?

15:55.864 --> 15:58.551
- Two days ago?
- I don't know where he at.

15:58.699 --> 16:00.257
Three days?

16:01.702 --> 16:03.156
You mind
if I look around?

16:03.303 --> 16:05.158
I'd rather you
leave my house be.

16:05.305 --> 16:08.138
Well, Ms. Anderson...

16:11.978 --> 16:13.264
your son is in trouble,

16:13.413 --> 16:15.666
and I can tell
you're upset.

16:15.814 --> 16:17.335
But the best thing
that you can do for him--

16:17.483 --> 16:19.170
the best thing that
he can do for himself--

16:19.318 --> 16:22.006
is talk to me.

16:22.153 --> 16:24.341
I'm gonna
tell you the truth:

16:24.489 --> 16:26.176
We know
he's selling drugs.

16:26.323 --> 16:27.611
And I'm gonna tell you...

16:27.758 --> 16:29.179
I don't know
nothin' about that.

16:29.326 --> 16:31.847
But I'm telling you
that I don't care

16:31.995 --> 16:33.849
he's selling drugs.

16:33.997 --> 16:36.830
I'm not even gonna
bother with that.

16:40.803 --> 16:43.591
I'm here
because of a homicide,

16:43.739 --> 16:45.460
and the way
it looks right now

16:45.608 --> 16:47.194
your boy is running
from the police

16:47.343 --> 16:49.463
behind that killing.

16:49.611 --> 16:51.164
I don't know
where he at...

16:51.312 --> 16:53.302
Ma'am...

17:07.492 --> 17:10.814
Councilman,
my people got only

17:10.963 --> 17:14.295
cost-of-living bumps
for four years.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.488
Morale is at rock bottom.

17:17.635 --> 17:19.823
All things being equal,
you'd be our guy.

17:19.971 --> 17:21.324
We like what we hear.

17:21.472 --> 17:24.160
The polls say
it's going to be Royce.

17:24.308 --> 17:25.994
We endorse you now,
we're out in the cold.

17:26.143 --> 17:28.664
Bobby... this might be
the chance to get in on

17:28.812 --> 17:30.666
the ground floor
of something better.

17:30.814 --> 17:33.168
That may be true, Major.
But for now,

17:33.316 --> 17:35.836
we're gonna play the cards
that we were dealt.

17:35.985 --> 17:38.173
Councilman,
if you were me, I'm sure--

17:38.320 --> 17:39.840
I'd cover my ass
and endorse Royce,

17:39.988 --> 17:42.175
along with the teachers
and the firefighters.

17:42.324 --> 17:43.344
But I'd also
tell my membership

17:43.492 --> 17:44.845
not to get carried away.
I mean,

17:44.993 --> 17:46.514
it's one thing
for the police union

17:46.661 --> 17:48.181
to call out for Royce,

17:48.329 --> 17:50.016
it's another thing entirely
for off-duty cops

17:50.164 --> 17:52.852
to be manning
the mayor's phone banks

17:52.999 --> 17:54.353
and polling stations.

17:54.502 --> 17:56.156
I don't think
any of my officers

17:56.303 --> 17:58.524
will be too aggressive
for anybody.

17:58.672 --> 18:01.004
That much I can give you.

18:04.544 --> 18:06.130
Best you could do,
Tommy.

18:06.278 --> 18:08.939
Royce has got all those
fucks runnin' scared.

18:10.449 --> 18:12.636
Yeah...

18:12.784 --> 18:14.539
best I could do.

18:14.686 --> 18:15.806
Call it a night, Tommy.

18:15.954 --> 18:17.973
You got a debate
to prepare for tomorrow.

18:18.122 --> 18:20.976
Yeah. Debate.

18:21.124 --> 18:22.812
Nothing matters more
at this point.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.480
Let the truth
set you free, Norman.

18:24.628 --> 18:26.960
Nothing matters at all.

18:32.101 --> 18:33.397
Thanks.

18:44.813 --> 18:47.667
Come on, boy,
come on now.

18:47.816 --> 18:49.502
Man, you better not
be getting tired,

18:49.650 --> 18:51.671
'cause you gonna
get put to the test

18:51.818 --> 18:53.905
- on Saturday night.
- I'm ready.

18:54.054 --> 18:57.342
- Hey, Miss Johnson.
- Hey, Justin. Hello, Dennis.

18:57.490 --> 18:58.510
You're Spider's mother, right?

18:58.658 --> 19:00.378
Right, Sharon.
Sharon Johnson.

19:00.527 --> 19:01.946
Your boy left here
a while ago.

19:02.095 --> 19:02.980
I ain't looking for him.

19:03.128 --> 19:04.615
He at his grandmother's.

19:04.763 --> 19:07.385
I wanted to ask you something.

19:07.533 --> 19:10.755
You know, my son
is crazy about you.

19:10.902 --> 19:13.456
All he talks about is boxing,
bein' at the gym,

19:13.604 --> 19:15.091
and what his coach
been teachin' him.

19:15.239 --> 19:16.526
Well, Spider's a good kid.

19:16.674 --> 19:18.228
He really studies
the sport.

19:18.376 --> 19:19.795
Dennis,
I am so grateful

19:19.943 --> 19:21.463
for your interest in Spider,

19:21.612 --> 19:22.798
I want to cook you dinner.

19:22.946 --> 19:23.966
How 'bout tonight?

19:24.114 --> 19:27.302
Well, ah, that is
really nice, Sharon.

19:27.449 --> 19:30.671
But the thing is, I got four of my boys
fighting this weekend,

19:30.819 --> 19:32.306
and I got to train 'em
really hard

19:32.454 --> 19:33.674
these next few evenings.

19:33.822 --> 19:35.475
You in here every night
of the week.

19:35.623 --> 19:37.645
What you do for fun?

19:37.792 --> 19:39.846
Look here,
you got to eat, right?

19:39.994 --> 19:42.149
And you can look
at me and know

19:42.296 --> 19:43.816
I throw down
in the kitchen--

19:43.965 --> 19:45.955
among other places.

19:47.301 --> 19:48.654
Yeah, I tell you what:

19:48.802 --> 19:50.790
If you fix me up a plate
and bring it over here,

19:50.938 --> 19:51.823
I would love that.

19:51.972 --> 19:53.633
That I can do.

19:56.842 --> 20:02.967
- He said what?
- "Me? I'm just the police."

20:03.114 --> 20:06.804
Like butter wouldn't
melt in his mouth.

20:06.952 --> 20:08.671
And the thing
that I resent most

20:08.820 --> 20:10.506
is that he's not
just playing the system,

20:10.655 --> 20:12.309
he's playing me.

20:12.456 --> 20:15.044
Like I'm part
of the problem.

20:15.192 --> 20:16.412
You were gonna
hold back the paper

20:16.560 --> 20:19.181
for Davis
and Krawczyk, right?

20:19.329 --> 20:22.017
Only until
the primary was over.

20:22.165 --> 20:24.827
And now you feel
guilty about it.

20:28.171 --> 20:30.024
Did he do that thing
where he, uh,

20:30.172 --> 20:32.640
stares at you over the top
of his reading glasses?

20:33.842 --> 20:36.529
You know,
that look that says,

20:36.678 --> 20:38.865
"I'm the father
you never had,

20:39.013 --> 20:42.005
and I don't want to be disappointed
in you ever again."

20:43.851 --> 20:46.872
It's not funny, Cedric!

20:47.021 --> 20:49.875
Those subpoenas
went out today!

20:50.023 --> 20:52.544
The front office is
gonna go batshit!

20:52.691 --> 20:55.023
But you did it anyway.

20:57.196 --> 20:59.884
I'm sorry, but shit,
I'm just glad to see

21:00.031 --> 21:03.364
Lester doing it
to somebody other than me.

21:18.314 --> 21:20.502
Hey, you holdin'
us back, Sherrod.

21:20.651 --> 21:23.312
I made a mistake, man.
Why you trippin'?

21:25.154 --> 21:27.108
If I can cut you loose
to handle the money,

21:27.255 --> 21:28.342
we can cover
twice the ground,

21:28.490 --> 21:30.477
selling twice
the merchandise.

21:30.625 --> 21:31.979
More-- more--
what you call it,

21:32.126 --> 21:34.380
uh, market share.

21:34.528 --> 21:36.816
Instead I gotta
keep your ass close.

21:36.964 --> 21:39.085
You shoulda been promoted
to your own cart by now.

21:39.233 --> 21:41.521
You keep on hittin' your dome
on the glass ceiling.

21:41.669 --> 21:44.289
- Glass what?
- You gotta step up the math skills

21:44.437 --> 21:46.691
if you wanna advance
in this here enterprise.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.193
You remember
last spring when

21:48.341 --> 21:49.694
you tried to take me
up to Harlem Park?

21:49.842 --> 21:51.028
They couldn't even find
my records, Bubs.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.697
They didn't want
shit to do with me.

21:52.844 --> 21:54.365
They put you
in a classroom, right?

21:54.513 --> 21:56.200
The teacher didn't
look at me once.

21:56.348 --> 21:57.368
So you rolled out.

21:57.516 --> 21:59.036
An' who got hurt
behind that, huh?

21:59.184 --> 22:01.038
The teacher or you?

22:01.185 --> 22:04.848
What's four times five
plus six times seven?

22:06.290 --> 22:08.450
See? See?

22:16.466 --> 22:19.555
Fuck that shit, son.
I can't wait until school starts.

22:19.702 --> 22:21.422
- You joking, right?
- Nah, seriously, son.

22:21.570 --> 22:23.157
I can't wait to see
all them girls,

22:23.304 --> 22:24.991
see which ones got phat
over the summer,

22:25.140 --> 22:26.993
- you know?
- Guess who I saw last week?

22:27.141 --> 22:28.995
- Who?
- Kwaneese Davis.

22:29.143 --> 22:31.163
Oh, shit, you mean
Cute-Ass Kwaneese?

22:31.312 --> 22:33.500
- Uh-huh.
- She phat?

22:33.647 --> 22:35.901
Got titties, too.

22:36.049 --> 22:38.003
I'm definitely tappin' that pussy,
now, y'all watch.

22:38.151 --> 22:39.605
I'm be all up
in Kwaneese this year

22:39.753 --> 22:41.307
Iike this, bangin' that...

22:41.455 --> 22:43.341
Just like you tried to do
last year, right?

22:43.490 --> 22:45.844
Fuck you, nigga,
I only halfway tried.

22:45.991 --> 22:48.179
So, Michael, who you
gettin' with this year?

22:48.327 --> 22:50.081
Stankin' ass, uh-- what's her name?
What's her name?

22:50.229 --> 22:51.316
- What's her name?
- Oh, Tina.

22:51.463 --> 22:52.650
Tina-- Tina Jenkins.

22:52.797 --> 22:54.351
Don't talk bad
about Tina, man.

22:54.499 --> 22:55.686
I'm not sayin'
that it bad.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.521
I'm sayin' she be
sucking dudes' dicks

22:57.668 --> 22:58.855
in the boys'
bathroom and shit,

22:59.003 --> 23:00.756
- that's all.
- I heard you, man.

23:00.905 --> 23:04.160
She suck dick even better
than you do, Namond.

23:04.307 --> 23:06.629
- Oh!
- Wow.

23:06.777 --> 23:08.130
What up?
What up, see?

23:08.277 --> 23:09.710
Good jabbin', man.

23:11.614 --> 23:14.135
Chill chill chill!
Don't rip this shit.

23:14.283 --> 23:15.971
I just bought
this throwback.

23:16.119 --> 23:17.972
Yo, Michael, son,
if I ain't had this shit on,

23:18.121 --> 23:20.975
I'd have fucked you up.
Word up.

23:21.123 --> 23:23.143
You little niggas ain't up
to no good, is you?

23:23.291 --> 23:24.812
Yo, what up, Monk?

23:24.959 --> 23:27.480
Look here, first day
of school coming up, right?

23:27.629 --> 23:32.151
- Yeah, next week.
- Y'all need school clothes and shit?

23:32.299 --> 23:33.323
Here...

23:34.634 --> 23:35.821
Yo, what's this for?

23:35.970 --> 23:37.990
What, you ain't hear me?
For new clothes,

23:38.138 --> 23:40.492
whatever else
you need to get.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.160
- Thanks, man!
- Damn, 200?

23:43.309 --> 23:46.330
- Yo, thanks, Monk.
- Oh, you need to thank my man Marlo.

23:46.478 --> 23:47.832
He ain't wanna see you
little motherfuckers

23:47.980 --> 23:50.001
going raggedy
on the first day.

23:50.148 --> 23:52.669
Whoa. That Marlo?

23:52.817 --> 23:55.538
- Naw, man, no thanks.
- You ain't gotta do nothing for it.

23:55.686 --> 23:57.677
No thank you, man.

24:00.323 --> 24:01.778
Hey, yo, Mr. Monk?

24:01.925 --> 24:03.579
I'll take his
if he don't want it.

24:03.727 --> 24:06.281
- I'll hold his for you--
- Yo, don't press, man.

24:06.429 --> 24:08.089
Don't press.

24:10.966 --> 24:13.788
Fuck is wrong
with you, boy?

24:13.936 --> 24:15.994
You too good
for my money?

24:17.005 --> 24:18.125
Or is you such
a bitch-ass punk

24:18.273 --> 24:20.503
you worried about where
my money come from?

24:28.382 --> 24:30.077
Yeah.

24:34.954 --> 24:36.641
Ain't no thing, shorty.

24:36.789 --> 24:38.278
We cool.

24:51.101 --> 24:52.655
You can't tell nobody.

24:52.803 --> 24:55.657
Swear to me you won't
spread this around.

24:55.806 --> 24:57.160
And he saw you?

24:57.307 --> 24:59.494
Yeah, he saw me.

24:59.643 --> 25:03.237
Carv, I'm fucked in the ass
with a pineapple on this.

25:06.416 --> 25:08.602
- What the helI'd you say to him?
- I said, "Mr. Mayor,

25:08.750 --> 25:09.937
that's a good,
strong dick you got there,

25:10.085 --> 25:11.105
and I see you know
how to use it."

25:11.253 --> 25:12.440
I didn't say shit!

25:12.588 --> 25:14.442
And I didn't wait for him
to say anything, either.

25:14.590 --> 25:16.277
Shit, I'm never gonna
make rank now.

25:16.424 --> 25:19.723
I'll end up riding the boat
or some shit like McNulty.

25:27.101 --> 25:28.620
This is way beyond
my pay grade.

25:28.768 --> 25:30.956
We need to get with someone
who knows politics.

25:31.103 --> 25:32.900
Who do we know
like that?

25:35.741 --> 25:36.961
On crime,
he knows you're coming,

25:37.109 --> 25:38.296
so he's gonna
set some traps

25:38.444 --> 25:40.732
and lean on stats
that say crime is down.

25:40.879 --> 25:42.399
He'll also try
to inoculate himself

25:42.547 --> 25:43.967
by making it about you.

25:44.115 --> 25:45.068
Like you're playing
the race card

25:45.216 --> 25:47.204
if you talk about drugs
or violent crime.

25:47.351 --> 25:48.638
He's hoping
you'll back down.

25:48.785 --> 25:50.340
But you come on
twice as hard:

25:50.487 --> 25:53.082
"Clarence Royce has not
made this city safe."

25:57.294 --> 25:58.913
Hey, Jen, what's up?

25:59.061 --> 26:02.584
- You got a second?
- No, I got time, what is it?

26:02.732 --> 26:04.219
- You forgot the check.
- Oh no, you're kidding me.

26:04.367 --> 26:05.754
You've got to
pay it right away.

26:05.901 --> 26:07.688
No, no, I got
the number here, yeah.

26:07.836 --> 26:09.591
No, I'll straighten
it out straightaway.

26:09.738 --> 26:11.258
- Okay.
- Yeah.

26:11.406 --> 26:13.093
Shit.

26:13.241 --> 26:14.427
I forgot to mail the check

26:14.576 --> 26:17.430
to the fuckin' archdiocese.

26:17.579 --> 26:19.098
My kid's gonna get tossed
outta St. Albans

26:19.246 --> 26:20.600
if I don't get
my shit together.

26:20.748 --> 26:23.238
Tommy. Focus.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.672
He comes at me with race
and some bullshit crime stats.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.441
I ignore the race thing
and counter by noting

26:29.589 --> 26:31.375
that homicides are up
15% even though

26:31.524 --> 26:33.912
other violent crime stats
are down 12%.

26:34.059 --> 26:35.546
I point out
this does not make sense

26:35.694 --> 26:37.148
unless Royce is cooking
the crime stats,

26:37.296 --> 26:39.817
making robberies, rapes,
and assaults disappear.

26:39.964 --> 26:42.953
I suggest the mayor is not telling
the truth about crime in the city.

26:43.100 --> 26:45.321
I conclude by declaring that
it is for all of Baltimore--

26:45.469 --> 26:46.356
every neighborhood--

26:46.504 --> 26:47.790
that I'm making public safety

26:47.939 --> 26:50.270
the cornerstone
of my campaign.

26:52.275 --> 26:55.631
Tomorrow night,
I will kick his ass.

26:55.778 --> 26:57.131
But the next morning,

26:57.280 --> 27:00.612
I still wake up white
in a city that ain't.

27:05.054 --> 27:06.072
Sister Theresa?

27:06.220 --> 27:08.742
Hey, how you doing?

27:08.891 --> 27:10.410
Yeah, Tommy Carcetti.

27:10.558 --> 27:13.078
Yo, Randy, man,
you crack me up, son.

27:13.227 --> 27:14.748
Running behind him
talking about,

27:14.895 --> 27:16.916
"I'll take his, Mr. Monk.
Give his to me."

27:17.064 --> 27:18.651
Listen, man,
I could've used that extra.

27:18.798 --> 27:19.919
I already spent
all the clothes money

27:20.067 --> 27:22.388
Miss Anna gave me on stuff
to sell at school.

27:22.535 --> 27:24.422
Yo, and plus Marlo
wanted us to have it.

27:24.571 --> 27:25.590
He want to show us

27:25.738 --> 27:27.592
who callin'
the shots out here.

27:27.740 --> 27:30.093
- Yo, Michael, why you ain't take it?
- that ain't me, man.

27:30.242 --> 27:32.430
- Say what?
- That owin' niggas for shit, man.

27:32.577 --> 27:34.765
- That ain't me.
- I'll take any motherfuckin' money

27:34.914 --> 27:37.601
- if he givin' it away now.
- Why?

27:37.748 --> 27:39.770
Shit, your family got
more money than all of us.

27:39.917 --> 27:41.437
Yeah, but my mom said
she cuttin' me off,

27:41.585 --> 27:43.439
she ain't buyin' me school
clothes and shit.

27:43.587 --> 27:45.555
You already took my job
with Bodie, so...

27:49.426 --> 27:51.446
- Gentlemen.
- Oh my God.

27:51.595 --> 27:52.856
Oh shit!

27:54.931 --> 27:58.953
- Donut, you crazy, man.
- Yo, Donut.

27:59.101 --> 28:00.955
You think you could steal us
one of them camper trucks?

28:01.103 --> 28:03.057
Yo, you steal us a camper truck,
we can all go campin'

28:03.204 --> 28:05.226
- out in the woods an' all.
- I be scared in the woods.

28:05.373 --> 28:07.760
I don't mean far like that.
I mean like Howard County.

28:07.908 --> 28:08.995
Naw naw naw, man.

28:09.143 --> 28:10.763
The Ku Klux Klan
live in Howard County.

28:10.911 --> 28:11.965
I know that for a fact.

28:12.112 --> 28:13.700
Nigga, my aunt live
in Howard County.

28:13.847 --> 28:15.901
There ain't no
Ku Klux Klan there.

28:16.050 --> 28:17.603
Nigga, you simple,
I swear.

28:17.751 --> 28:18.904
Hey, yo, Donut,
drive me away

28:19.052 --> 28:20.739
from these
ignorant bitches, man.

28:20.886 --> 28:22.074
You can't tell
these niggas nothin'.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.711
Move, motherfucker.

28:29.394 --> 28:31.414
Can you see
over the steering wheel?

28:31.563 --> 28:33.651
You think
he'll talk to me?

28:33.798 --> 28:34.918
Use my name
if you have to.

28:35.066 --> 28:37.728
I had one of his sectors
for eight months.

28:44.741 --> 28:46.795
What's wrong
with that picture?

28:46.943 --> 28:49.264
Nigga, if there was a
black one in the parking lot,

28:49.413 --> 28:50.845
I would've took one.

28:52.314 --> 28:54.407
Yo-- narcos,
narcos!

28:57.919 --> 28:59.273
760 to K-G-A.

28:59.421 --> 29:00.941
I got a bailout
at Calhoun and Mosher,

29:01.089 --> 29:02.709
six to eight juveniles
beating feet north

29:02.856 --> 29:04.711
in the alleys
around Calhoun.

29:04.858 --> 29:07.213
10-4. K-G-A to all units--

29:07.362 --> 29:09.352
I love this.
Just like old times.

29:14.033 --> 29:15.887
I don't need to chase
these fucking knuckleheads.

29:16.035 --> 29:18.056
I know half of 'em.

29:18.204 --> 29:20.025
Shit, I know
where they hang.

29:20.173 --> 29:22.226
Besides,
you're a little overdressed.

29:22.374 --> 29:26.538
Let's just call this in and go see
the man about your thing.

29:49.065 --> 29:50.952
Yo, yo, man,
I ain't do nothin'!

29:51.100 --> 29:53.587
- I ain't do nothin'!
- Then why you runnin'?

29:53.735 --> 29:56.090
- 'Cause you chasin' me.
- Yeah, right. What's your name?

29:56.237 --> 29:58.925
- For real, man, I ain't do nothin'.
- What's your goddamn name?

29:59.073 --> 30:00.327
- Randy.
- Randy what?

30:00.475 --> 30:02.761
- Wagstaff.
- I know you ain't lying.

30:02.910 --> 30:03.929
Wouldn't nobody
make that shit up.

30:04.077 --> 30:05.098
Put your hands against
this fucking wall.

30:05.245 --> 30:06.432
Come on--
what do you know

30:06.580 --> 30:08.167
about hoppers bailing
from a stolen car?

30:08.315 --> 30:10.078
Nothin'.

30:12.585 --> 30:13.938
Little motherfucker.
You slingin'.

30:14.087 --> 30:15.940
- No, sir. I swear to God.
- Hell you ain't.

30:16.089 --> 30:17.842
How else you walking around
with 200 in your pocket?

30:17.990 --> 30:19.844
My foster mother gave me that
to buy school clothes with.

30:19.992 --> 30:22.446
Your foster mother
gave you 200 cash?

30:22.595 --> 30:24.614
Yeah.

30:24.762 --> 30:26.116
Tell her to come down
to the Western,

30:26.264 --> 30:27.884
and I'll give it back to her.

30:28.032 --> 30:31.364
Beat feet, motherfucker,
before I lock your little ass up.

30:35.439 --> 30:38.101
Don't be fucking
lookin' at me, move.

30:42.178 --> 30:44.941
This right here is fire.

30:46.282 --> 30:48.803
That said, I'm ready
to serve 'em myself

30:48.950 --> 30:51.305
and keep your names off
the returns.

30:51.453 --> 30:53.140
I've got my 20.

30:53.287 --> 30:55.517
You two got to live
in this department.

30:57.958 --> 31:00.620
Fuck 'em
where they live.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.726
Let's go.

31:13.438 --> 31:15.393
The price of steel
being what it is,

31:15.541 --> 31:16.427
that's gonna kill us
if we can't

31:16.575 --> 31:18.261
pass along the overage.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.930
Mr. Krawczyk?
Baltimore City Police.

31:21.079 --> 31:23.410
- What's this?
- A subpoena for records.

31:24.916 --> 31:26.602
You need these right now,
because, uh,

31:26.751 --> 31:28.604
I'm kinda up to my ass
in stuff today.

31:28.753 --> 31:30.205
Honor it in a timely fashion.

31:30.353 --> 31:32.107
I think that's
the legal standard.

31:32.255 --> 31:36.111
- No problem, Detective--
- Shakima Greggs.

31:36.258 --> 31:38.447
You're with the city?

31:38.594 --> 31:41.757
- Which unit?
- Major Crimes.

31:48.770 --> 31:50.294
Senator.

31:54.942 --> 31:56.629
What the hell is this?

31:56.777 --> 31:58.130
Subpoena for records.

31:58.278 --> 32:00.832
Sphinx Club?

32:00.981 --> 32:03.903
- Man of the year.
- What kinda bullshit is this?

32:04.050 --> 32:05.837
You people must be out
your damn mind.

32:05.985 --> 32:07.572
You were in
the Sphinx Club?

32:07.720 --> 32:09.173
My uncle used
to tend bar over there.

32:09.322 --> 32:11.076
Marvin Thompson?
Short guy--

32:11.223 --> 32:13.744
What is your name,
Officer?

32:13.892 --> 32:15.883
Detective Sydnor, sir.

32:18.597 --> 32:20.984
"Major Crimes"?

32:21.131 --> 32:23.986
Shit...

32:24.134 --> 32:25.897
Enjoy your day, sir.

32:27.571 --> 32:30.233
Son, we're gonna see
about this.

32:39.881 --> 32:41.872
That's it.

32:44.353 --> 32:45.911
Yankin' that bitch.

32:48.155 --> 32:50.817
Son, that's too much knuckle.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.220
Why the fuck
you keep callin' me?

33:02.368 --> 33:03.388
But what I say, though?

33:03.535 --> 33:05.056
He got
the message, fool.

33:05.204 --> 33:06.390
Yo, Monk.
Who that, man?

33:06.538 --> 33:09.060
Andre.
Old Face Andre.

33:09.208 --> 33:11.729
Here, let me
holla at that dude.

33:11.876 --> 33:13.230
Yo, check this out, man.

33:13.379 --> 33:14.898
I'm gonna show you
how you do this

33:15.046 --> 33:16.566
right here, man.

33:16.714 --> 33:18.567
Don't rush me on shit.

33:18.716 --> 33:21.377
I'll get at you
when I'm at you.

33:25.889 --> 33:27.909
Yo, remember who
you're talking to

33:28.058 --> 33:30.218
before you say
another fuckin' word.

33:37.565 --> 33:38.919
Andre, man.

33:39.067 --> 33:40.087
Nigga need
more maintenance

33:40.235 --> 33:41.998
than both
my babies' mamas.

33:45.573 --> 33:48.700
By accident.
It was accidental.

33:51.078 --> 33:53.231
And the mayor
doesn't say anything?

33:53.380 --> 33:55.367
I think
he's pretty mad.

33:55.516 --> 33:57.769
I mean, Major,
I only took this detail

33:57.917 --> 33:59.771
to try and make sergeant
on this list.

33:59.918 --> 34:02.840
Kid, you made
sergeant already.

34:02.989 --> 34:05.342
Shit, if Royce
gets reelected,

34:05.490 --> 34:08.721
you'll be a lieutenant in two years
and a major in four.

34:10.860 --> 34:13.216
You go back down
to the hall.

34:13.364 --> 34:15.385
You act like
it never happened.

34:15.533 --> 34:17.053
You shut up.

34:17.201 --> 34:19.054
Say nothing to no one.

34:19.202 --> 34:20.389
But the mayor,
he's gonna--

34:20.538 --> 34:24.059
He's gonna watch
and see how you carry it.

34:24.206 --> 34:26.726
And kid,
you're a fucking rock.

34:26.876 --> 34:29.563
When the mayor
looks in your face,

34:29.712 --> 34:33.366
he knows he can
trust you with this.

34:33.514 --> 34:36.335
And I'll bet
in a couple of weeks,

34:36.485 --> 34:38.737
he comes asking,
real friendly-like,

34:38.886 --> 34:40.706
what are you looking
to do with the department?

34:40.855 --> 34:42.708
With your career?

34:42.857 --> 34:45.110
He's interested in you.

34:45.259 --> 34:47.313
But he doesn't mention
no blowjob,

34:47.460 --> 34:48.781
and neither do you.

34:48.929 --> 34:50.649
Uh-uh, it just lays there

34:50.797 --> 34:53.552
Iike a bad pierogi
on the plate,

34:53.699 --> 34:57.555
both of you pretending
it ain't there.

34:57.703 --> 34:59.457
What if he
screws me over?

34:59.604 --> 35:01.525
Bounces me
to a midnight shift?

35:01.674 --> 35:04.801
He does that,
you will talk.

35:11.682 --> 35:15.538
What I wouldn't give to be
in your shoes right now.

35:15.685 --> 35:17.707
Kid, careers have
been launched

35:17.854 --> 35:20.041
on a hell
of a lot less.

35:20.190 --> 35:24.182
Just shut up
and play dumb.

35:26.027 --> 35:29.717
I can do that.
No problem.

35:29.865 --> 35:31.385
Thanks, Major.

35:31.532 --> 35:34.053
Thanks for taking the time
to meet me on this.

35:34.202 --> 35:37.056
I mean, it's a weight off
my mind talking to you.

35:37.204 --> 35:38.391
It really is.

35:38.539 --> 35:40.393
Don't mention it.

35:40.541 --> 35:42.562
Maybe you get a chance
to do me a turn

35:42.709 --> 35:45.542
one day after
you make rank, huh?

35:48.548 --> 35:50.539
Oh, boy.

35:54.386 --> 35:56.377
It's all good, Carv.

36:01.059 --> 36:02.579
Because if some
federal motherfucker comes

36:02.727 --> 36:04.281
through the door,
I say, "Hey,

36:04.429 --> 36:06.016
it's all in the game."

36:06.163 --> 36:07.717
But a City Police?

36:07.864 --> 36:10.186
Baltimore City?
Hell, no.

36:10.333 --> 36:11.854
Can't be happenin',
'cause I know

36:12.002 --> 36:14.123
I have raised too much
goddamn money

36:14.271 --> 36:15.857
for the mayor
and his ticket.

36:16.006 --> 36:17.025
Hell, no!

36:17.174 --> 36:18.360
Ain't no soul
in the world

36:18.507 --> 36:20.338
that fuckin' ungrateful!

36:21.844 --> 36:24.265
- Calm down, Clay, hmm?
- Money laundering?

36:24.412 --> 36:25.867
They gonna
come talk to me

36:26.014 --> 36:27.200
about money laundering?

36:27.349 --> 36:28.703
In West Baltimore?

36:28.850 --> 36:31.038
Shit... Where do y'all
think I'm gonna

36:31.185 --> 36:33.373
raise cash for
the whole damn ticket?

36:33.521 --> 36:35.475
From laundromats
and shit?

36:35.622 --> 36:39.044
From some tiny-ass
Korean groceries?

36:39.193 --> 36:41.046
You think I have time
to ask a man

36:41.195 --> 36:43.048
why he givin' me money?

36:43.197 --> 36:44.883
Or where he gets
his money from?

36:45.032 --> 36:47.519
I'll take any motherfucker's money
if he givin' it away.

36:47.667 --> 36:49.988
- I don't wanna know.
- I know you don't wanna know.

36:50.135 --> 36:51.423
But I'm scratchin'
an' clawin'

36:51.570 --> 36:53.357
to get it done for you,
Clarence.

36:53.506 --> 36:55.926
For you and me
and the rest of the team.

36:56.073 --> 36:57.328
And who comes
through my door

36:57.476 --> 36:59.063
but a Baltimore City Police

36:59.210 --> 37:00.863
Iookin' to get up
into my shit about it.

37:01.012 --> 37:02.165
Clay, we didn't know
about that.

37:02.313 --> 37:03.900
I'm sorry, I gots
to leave up out of here

37:04.048 --> 37:05.868
before I lose
my damn mind.

37:06.016 --> 37:07.303
Nobody knew about that.

37:07.451 --> 37:08.538
You want
to run a campaign

37:08.685 --> 37:10.372
with my money
pillowed under your ass,

37:10.520 --> 37:14.148
you need your people
to back the fuck up, Clarence.

37:19.161 --> 37:20.514
Krawczyk's on line one.

37:20.662 --> 37:23.616
I'll jump on Burrell
and Demper both.

37:23.765 --> 37:24.919
Find out
what the hell's going on.

37:25.066 --> 37:27.554
Wait-- wait a minute.

37:27.702 --> 37:30.789
That new driver,
the bald-headed, white kid.

37:30.938 --> 37:32.958
Where did he
come here from?

37:33.107 --> 37:34.694
Hoskins brought
him in, I think.

37:34.841 --> 37:37.596
Hoskins?
He doesn't have a better rabbi

37:37.744 --> 37:38.996
in the department than that?

37:39.145 --> 37:41.033
Why, you want
to lose him?

37:41.180 --> 37:42.978
Let me think about it.

37:55.994 --> 37:58.615
Yeah, man, Officer Walker
be shady like that.

37:58.762 --> 38:00.450
Police be stealin', yo.

38:00.597 --> 38:03.252
Yo, what I really wanna
get is a bubble Caprice.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.087
I seen
a nice one, too.

38:05.235 --> 38:08.590
'94 caprice on 22's.
Shit was tight.

38:08.739 --> 38:10.892
You better be careful.
They almost caught you today.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.494
Nigga, they ain't
almost caught shit.

38:12.642 --> 38:14.129
Shh. Be quiet, y'all.

38:14.276 --> 38:15.496
Y'all know
who I am, right?

38:15.645 --> 38:17.931
Carver.
You a narcos.

38:18.079 --> 38:21.201
Today I'm auto theft.

38:21.349 --> 38:23.237
Fair warning.

38:23.385 --> 38:24.605
If I see any of
y'all little hoppers

38:24.752 --> 38:27.106
even smile
at a motor vehicle again,

38:27.255 --> 38:30.343
it ain't gonna be no juvenile hearing.
No, it's gonna be my people

38:30.491 --> 38:32.611
settlin' up with y'all in the alleys.
You understand?

38:32.760 --> 38:35.013
- You can't do that, yo.
- Try me, Namond.

38:35.162 --> 38:37.182
Yeah, that's right.
I know your name,

38:37.330 --> 38:38.917
I know where you live

38:39.065 --> 38:41.056
and I know where
y'all hang.

38:56.013 --> 39:00.176
Damn, yo!
Nice ride.

39:01.918 --> 39:04.306
- Hey, Bunk.
- Hmm?

39:04.453 --> 39:06.240
You have any luck
finding your shooter?

39:06.389 --> 39:08.477
Naw. He's runnin'.

39:08.624 --> 39:10.978
But at least I know who
my shooter is, right?

39:11.126 --> 39:12.647
I just got
to find the boy.

39:12.794 --> 39:14.816
- Family won't go for nothin'?
- Nah.

39:14.963 --> 39:17.117
Mother wouldn't say shit.

39:17.265 --> 39:18.819
But it wasn't the usual way
a mama lies.

39:18.967 --> 39:21.721
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

39:21.869 --> 39:23.489
It was a weird vibe, man.

39:23.638 --> 39:24.824
I can't explain it.

39:24.972 --> 39:27.770
It was like she was off
somewhere else in her head.

39:29.643 --> 39:32.198
Line four.
Communication.

39:32.345 --> 39:34.767
- Who's up?
- I'm up. I'll take it.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.367
No, wait.

39:36.515 --> 39:38.503
If it's yours,
you lucky bitch,

39:38.651 --> 39:41.505
then it's a domestic
in a house with four wits.

39:41.653 --> 39:43.507
- You want the call?
- But I pick up that phone,

39:43.655 --> 39:45.108
do I make it unlucky?

39:45.256 --> 39:46.410
Or is it still your call?

39:46.558 --> 39:49.179
You want the call,
pick it up.

39:49.326 --> 39:51.817
If you don't, don't.

39:53.764 --> 39:55.518
Homicide. Norris.

39:55.666 --> 39:59.499
Right. Uh-huh. I got it.

40:02.171 --> 40:05.527
1400 Lanvale, in the street,
found by the post officer,

40:05.674 --> 40:07.642
no suspects,
no witnesses.

40:11.513 --> 40:13.674
Ah, man.

40:16.350 --> 40:18.910
Better to be lucky
than to be good.

40:21.821 --> 40:25.210
You wanna work
the heavy bag?

40:25.358 --> 40:27.519
G'head. Four rounds.

40:41.840 --> 40:42.726
Hey.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.227
- Hey.
- I'm Gail.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.129
I made this for you
and the other men

40:46.277 --> 40:48.798
to let you know
you're appreciated.

40:48.945 --> 40:51.734
- That's real nice.
- Peach cobbler.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.903
I'm sorry, I forgot
whose mother you are.

40:54.051 --> 40:55.137
Oh, I don't have
any boys.

40:55.285 --> 40:56.938
I just appreciate
what you been doing,

40:57.087 --> 40:59.174
you and the other coaches
volunteering and all.

40:59.321 --> 41:01.109
Well, thank you,
that's real nice.

41:01.257 --> 41:03.978
I got three girls. Y'all don't
teach girls, though, do you?

41:04.126 --> 41:07.848
- No, I'm real old-fashioned about that.
- Oh, I agree wit' you.

41:07.997 --> 41:10.517
Men should be men
and women should be women.

41:10.665 --> 41:12.496
That's what I think.

41:18.005 --> 41:20.526
Single wound,
upper back, no casings,

41:20.674 --> 41:22.194
no witnesses, and nothing
on the canvas.

41:22.341 --> 41:24.863
- Dead when you got here?
- Actually not.

41:25.011 --> 41:27.365
He was still conscious
and coughin' blood when I pulled up.

41:27.513 --> 41:29.600
- You ask who shot him?
- Yeah, I asked who shot him.

41:29.749 --> 41:32.149
He said it was
a guy with a gun.

41:38.422 --> 41:41.377
Yo, why the fuck
you keep calling me?

41:41.525 --> 41:43.079
He got the message, fool.

41:43.227 --> 41:44.347
Yo, Monk,
who that, man?

41:44.494 --> 41:46.827
Andre.
Old Face Andre.

41:48.532 --> 41:49.885
Yo, Monk,
who that, man?

41:50.033 --> 41:52.688
Andre.
Old Face Andre.

41:52.835 --> 41:55.657
Lemme key that.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.058
Yo, Monk.
Who that, man?

41:57.207 --> 41:59.367
Andre.
Old Face Andre.

42:02.978 --> 42:05.208
Yo, check this out, man.

42:07.315 --> 42:09.336
Don't rush me on shit.

42:09.484 --> 42:11.816
- I'll get at you when I'm at you.
- I'm just saying...

42:14.589 --> 42:16.175
Old Face Andre.

42:16.323 --> 42:17.676
Tryin' to reup
with Monk Metcalf.

42:17.824 --> 42:20.012
Yeah, well, Monk took the call
on his cell phone.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.680
But that second voice
ranked him.

42:21.827 --> 42:23.148
Ranked everybody,
by the sound of it.

42:23.295 --> 42:25.683
Marlo Stanfield.
On the phone.

42:25.831 --> 42:28.753
The way he shut that call down,
I'd say, yeah, that was him.

42:28.900 --> 42:30.954
Yeah, but what was all that
in the background? Fireworks, or--

42:31.103 --> 42:33.991
Naw, it was regular intervals.
Semi-auto from the sound.

42:34.139 --> 42:35.692
Target practice, maybe.

42:35.840 --> 42:38.027
Either that
or a firing squad.

42:38.176 --> 42:41.797
There are no bodies
on this guy in months,

42:41.945 --> 42:43.199
but we get him
on the phone

42:43.347 --> 42:44.867
and it sounds
like a war zone.

42:45.014 --> 42:47.203
Well, at least he gets
on a phone now and then.

42:47.351 --> 42:50.038
- That's something.
- Sounds arrogant, doesn't he?

42:50.186 --> 42:52.374
Like he's the lil' king
of everything.

42:52.522 --> 42:54.352
Ah. Youth.

43:09.637 --> 43:10.968
Yo, bubs.

43:13.974 --> 43:16.828
Thought you asleep.

43:16.976 --> 43:19.665
If you want...

43:19.812 --> 43:22.145
I could go
to school some.

43:23.982 --> 43:25.836
I ain't been
for a while,

43:25.984 --> 43:29.673
so I don't even
know if I can.

43:29.822 --> 43:32.642
But if you
want me to go...

43:32.790 --> 43:34.781
ain't no thing.

44:22.535 --> 44:24.655
His Honor was mad?

44:24.803 --> 44:26.889
I can't begin
to describe it.

44:27.038 --> 44:29.759
- What's he want from us?
- To block the subpoenas,

44:29.908 --> 44:32.495
but he knows we can't
once those things go out.

44:32.643 --> 44:34.831
What I could promise him

44:34.979 --> 44:38.100
is no more surprises
out of our shop.

44:38.249 --> 44:40.202
Is this that
cocksucker McNulty?

44:40.351 --> 44:43.839
Not this time. He's been gone
from that unit a year.

44:43.987 --> 44:47.342
My best guess would be
Lester Freamon.

44:47.489 --> 44:49.877
- Freamon?
- Lester's got a helluva game.

44:50.025 --> 44:51.778
Well, we need to sit
on the motherfucker.

44:51.927 --> 44:52.847
All that unit needs,
Commissioner,

44:52.994 --> 44:55.122
is proper supervision.

44:57.798 --> 44:58.985
Hey, the State of Maryland

44:59.133 --> 45:00.754
just lost another
cooperating witness,

45:00.901 --> 45:03.156
and I just found a lot
of fucking overtime.

45:03.303 --> 45:05.458
This case went from
a who-gives-a-fuck drug murder

45:05.605 --> 45:07.596
to straight-up red ball.

45:11.611 --> 45:14.602
Fuck, I should've
picked up that phone.

45:17.950 --> 45:19.137
Hey, Sarge.
My boy's a witness.

45:19.284 --> 45:21.071
Drug case pending
in part 18.

45:21.220 --> 45:23.306
You know for sure
he's killed for that reason?

45:23.454 --> 45:25.408
Don't know shit. But from the look
of the court computer,

45:25.556 --> 45:27.344
this guy's
the state's whole case.

45:27.491 --> 45:29.979
Don't put it in the 24 that
the guy was a witness.

45:30.128 --> 45:32.148
Trust me,
we do not wanna kick shit

45:32.296 --> 45:34.817
in an election year.
Work the case, take the O.T.,

45:34.964 --> 45:38.298
but bury the witness angle
till we know for sure.

45:39.969 --> 45:41.960
And close the door.

45:56.817 --> 45:58.171
Yeah.

45:58.319 --> 45:59.839
It's Landsman. Homicide.

45:59.986 --> 46:02.408
Is the major
in this morning?

46:02.555 --> 46:04.209
Next order of business:
class rules.

46:04.357 --> 46:06.244
It helps if the team
is constant on these.

46:06.392 --> 46:08.280
Less wiggle room
for the children.

46:08.428 --> 46:09.447
Mrs. Scott?

46:09.594 --> 46:11.483
Same as last year,
double space.

46:11.630 --> 46:13.318
Language Arts,
we grade a lot of papers.

46:13.465 --> 46:14.952
It doesn't make them
write any better,

46:15.100 --> 46:16.886
but it saves my eyesight.

46:17.035 --> 46:19.223
Make sure you
demonstrate it for them.

46:19.370 --> 46:21.457
Some of them think double-space
means more space between words.

46:21.605 --> 46:23.126
I'd of thought
by eighth grade--

46:23.274 --> 46:26.162
Rule of thumb around here,
Mr. Pryzbylewski: Never assume.

46:26.310 --> 46:27.629
Explain what
you want them to do,

46:27.778 --> 46:29.765
have them do it,
then explain again.

46:29.914 --> 46:32.134
With time and patience,
they'll get it.

46:32.282 --> 46:35.103
- Mrs. Shapiro?
- It's easier to keep track of lab work

46:35.251 --> 46:37.072
if we all use
the same heading.

46:37.219 --> 46:39.941
Upper right-hand corner,
above the first blue line:

46:40.089 --> 46:43.476
name, date, and class number,
in that order?

46:43.625 --> 46:45.946
Mr. Pryzbylewski, do you have
anything you want addressed?

46:46.094 --> 46:48.582
Can we have them
not chew gum?

46:48.730 --> 46:50.650
They won't do it
in Ms. Sampson's class,

46:50.798 --> 46:53.118
but in four years, I have not
been able to stop them.

46:53.267 --> 46:55.955
You can try, but first year,
it's best to stick with basics.

46:56.103 --> 46:57.356
And team rules--
we can only go

46:57.504 --> 46:59.391
with what
we can all enforce.

46:59.539 --> 47:01.993
Also, keep your
windows closed.

47:02.142 --> 47:04.762
Makes them drowsy,
and drowsy's good.

47:04.910 --> 47:07.232
There's a lot to learn.
But for now,

47:07.380 --> 47:09.434
build in lots of activities
in your lesson plan.

47:09.581 --> 47:10.601
You can't have enough.

47:10.750 --> 47:13.582
You keep them busy,
you keep them off-guard.

47:16.955 --> 47:19.910
You need soft eyes.

47:20.057 --> 47:22.048
Excuse me?

47:24.961 --> 47:26.282
Yeah, but that
doesn't prevent you

47:26.430 --> 47:28.483
from giving more
under your wife's name,

47:28.631 --> 47:30.218
your children, if they
got separate accounts...

47:30.366 --> 47:31.993
yeah.

47:33.435 --> 47:36.090
Sorry, Richie,
can you hold a moment?

47:36.239 --> 47:37.958
Your buddy
from the F.O.P.

47:38.106 --> 47:39.294
And he says
it's important.

47:39.441 --> 47:41.395
Hey, Stan.

47:41.543 --> 47:44.130
I'm a little busy
losing an election here.

47:44.279 --> 47:46.232
You remember about
six months ago,

47:46.380 --> 47:47.800
you told me
to keep an eye for

47:47.948 --> 47:49.569
any witnesses
gettin' clipped?

47:49.717 --> 47:51.708
You remember that?

47:53.286 --> 47:55.777
Who's better than me,
Tommy?

47:57.791 --> 48:00.145
Hey, Richie,
can I call you back?

48:00.292 --> 48:02.021
Thanks.

48:07.066 --> 48:09.086
Anything else you want me
to do, Miss Donnelly?

48:09.233 --> 48:10.587
Uh...

48:10.736 --> 48:12.722
you live near
Duquan Weems, correct?

48:12.870 --> 48:14.591
Dukie?

48:14.739 --> 48:16.792
I want you to take
this to his house.

48:16.941 --> 48:18.295
These clothes won't
stay clean long.

48:18.442 --> 48:20.629
Make sure you deliver
them just to Duquan,

48:20.778 --> 48:22.097
not any of the adults
in the house.

48:22.245 --> 48:24.265
- Just Duquan.
- Want me to do it tonight?

48:24.414 --> 48:26.936
that would be great.
And, Crystal, thanks for today.

48:27.083 --> 48:29.437
You're welcome,
Miss Donnelly.

48:29.585 --> 48:31.606
- Can I help you?
- Yes, ma'am.

48:31.754 --> 48:33.274
This young man has to be
registered for school.

48:33.422 --> 48:36.110
- Does he attend here?
- He should.

48:36.257 --> 48:39.124
What I mean is, what grade
were you in last year, dear?

48:41.062 --> 48:43.115
He kinda lost his way
some time ago.

48:43.264 --> 48:44.517
He's livin'
with me now.

48:44.666 --> 48:45.618
And you are his...

48:45.766 --> 48:47.757
Uncle.
I'm his uncle.

48:49.103 --> 48:51.264
Come into my office.

48:57.777 --> 48:59.767
Thank you.
Excuse me.

49:16.926 --> 49:19.190
Yo, look at coach
workin' it, yo.

49:23.233 --> 49:25.486
A'ight, man, break.
That's what I like to see, baby.

49:25.635 --> 49:27.589
That's what I like to see.
You gotta use that left

49:27.736 --> 49:31.092
- a little more, though, a'ight?
- Yo, man, you finished?

49:31.240 --> 49:33.426
- Got another two minutes.
- Fuck that, I got a fight coming up.

49:33.575 --> 49:34.762
You can come back
later, a'ight?

49:34.909 --> 49:36.162
Yo, man said he got
one more round, a'ight?

49:36.310 --> 49:37.430
Step aside, youngin'.

49:37.578 --> 49:39.299
Naw, man, bag is mine
for four rounds

49:39.447 --> 49:42.468
- and I only did three.
- Fuck that.

49:42.617 --> 49:44.270
What the fuck you
tryin' to prove, huh?

49:44.417 --> 49:46.271
Whoa, whoa. Come on, man,
come on. Come on.

49:46.419 --> 49:48.440
- What's going on, boy?
- I got a fight Saturday night,

49:48.587 --> 49:49.608
an' the boy won't
get off the bag.

49:49.755 --> 49:51.176
What the fuck he on
the bag for anyway, huh?

49:51.323 --> 49:53.211
He don't even fight.
He don't even spar.

49:53.360 --> 49:54.512
Spar with
your ass any day.

49:54.661 --> 49:56.280
- Come on, then.
- Hey hey hey.

49:56.428 --> 49:57.548
Y'all be cool,
you hear me?

49:57.696 --> 49:59.617
I ain't putting up
with this foolishness.

49:59.764 --> 50:02.119
Come here, Michael.

50:02.267 --> 50:04.988
- I can work the bag now, right?
- Not yet. Just wait.

50:05.135 --> 50:07.691
- You said four rounds.
- Yeah, I know what I said.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.626
You finish up your rounds,
and then Justin gets on.

50:10.775 --> 50:12.561
I don't want hear
no more street talk.

50:12.709 --> 50:14.797
We boxin' up in here,
we ain't fightin'.

50:14.945 --> 50:16.298
He wanna get in
the ring with me,

50:16.445 --> 50:18.800
- we can go.
- Look here, look here,

50:18.949 --> 50:20.935
Iet me tell you something:
You can come here,

50:21.083 --> 50:22.469
work out,
use the equipment.

50:22.618 --> 50:23.805
But nobody
gets in that ring

50:23.952 --> 50:25.639
unless they're being trained.

50:25.787 --> 50:27.778
You wanna be trained?

50:28.957 --> 50:30.577
I've been watching you
hit that bag.

50:30.724 --> 50:32.312
You got
a natural right hand,

50:32.460 --> 50:34.647
the way you throw it,
the way you land it.

50:34.796 --> 50:35.982
Now if I was
to train you,

50:36.130 --> 50:37.417
we'd have to start
with floor work.

50:37.565 --> 50:39.318
'Cause see, if you don't
know how to move,

50:39.466 --> 50:42.120
you ain't got no business
being in that ring.

50:42.269 --> 50:43.822
So what you think?

50:43.971 --> 50:46.803
I'd train you myself,
personally.

50:49.142 --> 50:50.996
Nah, really I just wanna keep

50:51.143 --> 50:52.496
doing what I been doing.

50:52.644 --> 50:53.975
All right.

51:00.652 --> 51:01.771
Let's see that right.

51:01.919 --> 51:02.908
Uh-huh.

51:16.832 --> 51:18.586
Is Dukie here?

51:18.734 --> 51:21.355
What's that?
That's for Duquan, right?

51:21.503 --> 51:24.124
I take it to him.

51:24.273 --> 51:25.626
Gimme.

51:25.773 --> 51:27.794
Hey, Crystal.

51:27.942 --> 51:29.796
Miss Donnelly said
to give you these.

51:29.944 --> 51:31.775
Okay.
I'll be right down.

51:33.947 --> 51:36.335
What?

51:36.483 --> 51:38.604
And for either of
my opponents to suggest

51:38.752 --> 51:40.906
that downtown development
comes at the expense

51:41.054 --> 51:43.074
of our city's neighborhoods,

51:43.223 --> 51:47.444
well, that's just unfair
and, uh, divisive.

51:47.593 --> 51:50.648
For them to suggest
that my administration

51:50.795 --> 51:53.717
has not been
responsive, well...

51:53.865 --> 51:56.086
Economic development
cannot be a band-aid.

51:56.234 --> 51:59.823
It is a long-term process
that requires commitment

51:59.970 --> 52:02.825
to retraining our workforce
and, as I said before,

52:02.973 --> 52:04.259
this can only be successful

52:04.408 --> 52:05.862
in a city where
people feel safe.

52:06.010 --> 52:07.763
So before we can
even begin to think about

52:07.910 --> 52:09.297
Iuring new industries to Baltimore,

52:09.445 --> 52:10.999
we need to think about
how we can make

52:11.147 --> 52:14.335
these neighborhoods
and this city safe once again.

52:14.484 --> 52:16.938
Mr. Carcetti may think
it's in his interest

52:17.085 --> 52:18.439
to exploit people's fears.

52:18.588 --> 52:22.276
He's been doing it
throughout this campaign.

52:22.423 --> 52:23.776
I'm offended by it,
personally.

52:23.925 --> 52:25.512
But the fact is,

52:25.661 --> 52:28.982
that violent crime
is down citywide,

52:29.130 --> 52:31.850
and our police department
is working hard

52:31.999 --> 52:33.118
to keep it that way--

52:33.267 --> 52:36.121
and will continue to do so
under my administration.

52:36.269 --> 52:37.289
Councilman Carcetti,

52:37.437 --> 52:39.791
you have two minutes
to respond.

52:39.939 --> 52:41.126
Does anyone in this room
really believe

52:41.273 --> 52:42.961
that crime is down
in Baltimore?

52:43.108 --> 52:44.629
You calling me a liar,
Tommy?

52:44.777 --> 52:46.864
Gentleman, please.
No personal interactions.

52:47.011 --> 52:49.699
- Councilman Carcetti.
- Can the mayor honestly tell

52:49.847 --> 52:52.170
the people of Rosemont,
of Belair Edison,

52:52.317 --> 52:53.637
of Highlandtown
or Cherry Hill

52:53.785 --> 52:56.640
there's less drug-dealing,
less violence?

52:56.787 --> 52:58.942
Any statistics coming
from the police department

52:59.089 --> 53:00.809
cannot be trusted,
because under this mayor,

53:00.957 --> 53:02.578
the police are more concerned

53:02.726 --> 53:05.780
with protecting Clarence Royce
politically than fighting crime.

53:05.929 --> 53:08.750
There's no leadership
and morale has never been lower.

53:08.899 --> 53:10.118
I'll change that.

53:10.266 --> 53:12.419
It's business as usual
down at City Hall

53:12.568 --> 53:14.923
and as a result,
our response to crime

53:15.070 --> 53:17.257
has been characterized
time and time again

53:17.406 --> 53:19.927
by wanton indifference.

53:20.075 --> 53:21.460
...32 yards!

53:21.609 --> 53:24.764
What do I mean
by business as usual?

53:24.912 --> 53:26.999
What do I mean
by wanton indifference?

53:27.147 --> 53:29.602
Well, last night
in West Baltimore,

53:29.750 --> 53:31.437
on Lanvale Street,

53:31.584 --> 53:34.072
another citizen
was shot and killed.

53:34.221 --> 53:35.907
This time, the victim
was a key witness

53:36.055 --> 53:37.842
in a drug case that
had yet to come to court.

53:37.990 --> 53:40.844
Courageously, this man
had agreed to testify

53:40.993 --> 53:42.813
in two weeks time
in that case.

53:42.961 --> 53:44.882
The police should have
been protecting him.

53:45.030 --> 53:47.952
They were not,
and he was murdered.

53:48.099 --> 53:50.120
- Oh, shit.
- Why? Because this mayor...

53:50.267 --> 53:51.454
You're prime-time, Eddie.

53:51.603 --> 53:53.823
...would not spend the money
to protect him.

53:53.971 --> 53:55.792
Now I have no doubt
that in a moment or two

53:55.940 --> 53:57.627
Clarence Royce will
accuse me of exploiting

53:57.774 --> 53:59.962
this man's death
for my own political purpose.

54:00.110 --> 54:02.064
But the truth is,

54:02.212 --> 54:04.999
a year ago I wrote
the mayor a letter.

54:05.148 --> 54:06.601
I have copies for anyone
who wants one.

54:06.750 --> 54:08.970
I begged him
to spend the money

54:09.118 --> 54:10.871
and make witness protection
a priority.

54:11.019 --> 54:12.372
He ignored me.

54:12.521 --> 54:14.275
I even teamed up
with our legislative leaders--

54:14.422 --> 54:15.775
Delegate Watkins
and others--

54:15.924 --> 54:17.744
to get matching funds
for witness protection

54:17.892 --> 54:18.945
approved in Annapolis.

54:19.093 --> 54:21.081
And incredibly
those matching funds

54:21.229 --> 54:22.949
were never claimed
by this administration.

54:23.097 --> 54:25.417
Now to mention this
now may be exploitive--

54:25.565 --> 54:27.953
I don't know.
I only know it's true,

54:28.101 --> 54:30.256
and on such truths
I ask the voters

54:30.403 --> 54:32.872
of our city
to consider a change.

54:37.243 --> 54:38.896
Folks, please, please,
hold your applause

54:39.044 --> 54:41.765
until after the round
of questions is over.

54:41.913 --> 54:42.833
Mayor Royce?

54:42.981 --> 54:46.103
No more surprises, huh?

54:46.251 --> 54:49.872
I am unaware of the specifics
of the incident

54:50.020 --> 54:52.141
to which Councilman Carcetti
is referring,

54:52.289 --> 54:55.477
uh, so I can't answer
that directly, um...

54:55.626 --> 54:58.981
however, I can say
that this city places

54:59.128 --> 55:02.817
the highest priority
on protecting those citizens

55:02.965 --> 55:04.418
who come forward to testify,

55:04.567 --> 55:07.354
and we will continue
to do so.

55:07.502 --> 55:11.358
Mr. Carcetti states
that he wrote a letter

55:11.505 --> 55:14.395
expressing his concerns,
and I'm sure that he did.

55:14.542 --> 55:15.862
I mean it's-- it's--

55:16.011 --> 55:17.397
it's easy enough
to write letters

55:17.545 --> 55:20.033
when all you have to do
is write letters.

55:20.181 --> 55:23.402
But when you
are required

55:23.550 --> 55:25.904
to run a city

55:26.052 --> 55:28.907
on limited resources,

55:29.054 --> 55:31.076
and balance priorities,

55:31.223 --> 55:33.912
well, then-- well,
then you understand

55:34.059 --> 55:36.913
that writing letters will
not solve the problem.

55:37.062 --> 55:38.689
Oh, no...

55:40.231 --> 55:42.419
Shit, girl.

55:42.567 --> 55:45.588
You know
I'm-a roll wit' you.

55:45.735 --> 55:49.759
Huh, I need
some kinda break.

55:49.906 --> 55:52.067
Mm-hmm.

56:06.622 --> 56:09.021
Oh, shit.

56:21.801 --> 56:23.555
Ain't nothin' worse
than them bitches

56:23.703 --> 56:27.726
with fucked-up nails
at the blackjack table.

56:27.873 --> 56:30.694
You know.

56:30.842 --> 56:33.164
Hold on.

56:33.311 --> 56:34.898
You think my son
gonna go up

56:35.046 --> 56:37.378
to that school lookin'
like himself?

56:42.887 --> 56:44.741
And I don't believe
we can get a handle on crime

56:44.889 --> 56:46.908
until we get a handle
on the schools.

56:47.057 --> 56:49.077
Because we need to be
thinking about these kids

56:49.225 --> 56:51.246
before the corners
take them.

56:51.394 --> 56:53.725
And this means a renewed focus
on our schools...
