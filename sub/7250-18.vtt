06:04.906 --> 06:07.159
BUT HOW COULD WE GET

06:04.906 --> 06:07.159
A CELEBRITY IN HERE?

06:07.201 --> 06:08.994
I KNOW TONY RANDALL

06:07.201 --> 06:08.994
AND RENEE ESTEVEZ.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.038
I'D BE HAPPY TO PUT IN A CALL.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.831
LOOK, I HATE

06:11.079 --> 06:12.831
TO BRING THIS UP,

06:12.873 --> 06:15.374
ESPECIALLY SINCE, I MEAN,

06:12.873 --> 06:15.374
HOW DO YOU TOP RENEE ESTEVEZ,

06:15.416 --> 06:17.669
BUT WE HAVE A SMALL NUMBER

06:15.416 --> 06:17.669
OF ROOMS, YES?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.547
THE LOBBY'S FINE, AND SOOKIE CAN

06:17.711 --> 06:20.547
MAKE CERTAIN THINGS AT HOME --

06:20.588 --> 06:23.842
MUFFINS, BAKED GOODS,

06:20.588 --> 06:23.842
JAMS, ET CETERA.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.053
SO THAT'S BREAKFAST,

06:23.884 --> 06:26.053
AND WE HAVE BEDS,

06:26.094 --> 06:27.721
AND IF WE ADD SOME

06:26.094 --> 06:27.721
FREE WINE AND CHEESE

06:27.762 --> 06:29.890
AROUND 5:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.767
NO, WE'RE NOT BECOMING

06:29.931 --> 06:32.767
A BED AND BREAKFAST.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.767
YOU'RE BEING STUBBORN.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.936
BED AND BREAKFASTS ARE

06:32.809 --> 06:34.936
CUTESY AND ANNOYING.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.731
IT FORCES PEOPLE TO MINGLE.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.731
I DO NOT SUPPORT THE MINGLING.

06:37.772 --> 06:41.318
ADDING A LITTLE GIMMICK WILL

06:37.772 --> 06:41.318
BE INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO KEEP

06:37.772 --> 06:41.318
THEIR RESERVATIONS.

06:41.360 --> 06:45.155
YOU KNOW WHAT? I HATE TO

06:41.360 --> 06:45.155
SAY IT, NOT BEING A

06:41.360 --> 06:45.155
B &amp; B MAN MYSELF,

06:45.197 --> 06:46.573
BUT MICHEL IS MAKING SENSE.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.283
GET OFF MY SIDE IMMEDIATELY.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.618
ALRIGHT,

06:48.325 --> 06:50.618
I'LL CONSIDER IT.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.454
SURE, IF HE SAYS IT,

06:50.660 --> 06:53.454
YOU WILL CONSIDER IT.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.207
I GOT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

06:55.249 --> 06:58.293
IS IT BAD?

06:55.249 --> 06:58.293
NO, IT'S GREAT.

06:55.249 --> 06:58.293
YOU'RE GONNA BE THRILLED.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.379
WARM UP.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.379
CARTWHEELS ARE COMING.

07:00.419 --> 07:03.631
KEEP TALKING.

07:00.419 --> 07:03.631
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.300
EXCUSE ME, LORELAI.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.094
LISTEN, I KNOW YOU'RE

07:05.342 --> 07:07.094
CRAZED RIGHT NOW,

07:07.135 --> 07:10.180
BUT I ALSO REMEMBERED THAT YOUR

07:07.135 --> 07:10.180
BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP ON FRIDAY,

07:10.222 --> 07:12.224
AND, WELL, I GOT YOU

07:10.222 --> 07:12.224
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.101
OH, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO

07:12.266 --> 07:14.101
DO THAT.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.643
IT'S VERY SMALL.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.437
TOBIN, I LOVE CANDLES.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.106
AND IT'S SCENTED --

07:17.478 --> 07:19.106
CAPPUCCINO.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.732
GOD, THAT SMELLS GREAT.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.193
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU

07:20.774 --> 07:23.193
LIKE IT.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.193
I DO. THANKS.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.195
AND, LISTEN, I'M

07:23.235 --> 07:25.195
THE NIGHT MANAGER HERE,

07:25.237 --> 07:27.530
AND I'M VERY PROUD TO BE

07:25.237 --> 07:27.530
THE NIGHT MANAGER,

07:27.572 --> 07:30.075
BUT WITH EVERYTHING SO WACKY

07:27.572 --> 07:30.075
CRAZY AROUND HERE RIGHT NOW,

07:30.117 --> 07:33.328
IF YOU NEED SOME EXTRA HELP

07:30.117 --> 07:33.328
DURING THE DAY, PLEASE CALL ME.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.914
I MAY TAKE YOU UP ON

07:33.370 --> 07:35.914
THAT OFFER, TOBIN. THANKS.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.383
STAIRS SQUEAK.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.927
THERE'S A CHIP

07:46.425 --> 07:48.927
ON THE BANISTER.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.927
CHIP ON THE BANISTER.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.804
THE PAINT'S CHIPPED IN

07:48.969 --> 07:50.804
THE ARCHWAY,

07:50.845 --> 07:54.141
AND THERE'S A BOARD LOOSE

07:50.845 --> 07:54.141
IN THE ENTRYWAY,

07:54.182 --> 07:55.976
AND THE CHIMNEY NEEDS TO

07:54.182 --> 07:55.976
BE SWEPT.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.145
MOM, LUKE CANNOT SWEEP

07:56.017 --> 07:58.145
OUR CHIMNEY.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.145
WHY NOT?

07:58.186 --> 08:00.939
YOU NEED TO BE A CHIMNEY

07:58.186 --> 08:00.939
SWEEP TO SWEEP A CHIMNEY.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.483
IF DICK VAN DYKE CAN DO IT,

08:00.981 --> 08:03.483
SO CAN LUKE.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.402
LUKE IS GOING TO BE VERY SORRY.

08:05.444 --> 08:08.322
HEY, LUKE HAS GIVEN ME FIVE

08:05.444 --> 08:08.322
FREE HOURS OF HANDYMAN WORK

08:08.363 --> 08:10.365
FOR MY BIRTHDAY FOR

08:08.363 --> 08:10.365
THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.909
YOU HAVE GROSSLY EXPLOITED THAT

08:10.407 --> 08:12.909
FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS.

08:12.951 --> 08:16.079
I DIDN'T MILK IT THE

08:12.951 --> 08:16.079
FIRST YEAR LIKE I SHOULD HAVE.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.415
THE SPIRIT OF GIVING IS

08:16.121 --> 08:18.415
COMPLETELY LOST ON YOU.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.708
BUT THE SPIRIT OF GETTING IS

08:18.457 --> 08:20.708
ALIVE AND WELL.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.127
IT WANTS ITS CHIMNEY SWEPT.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.628
OOH! PUT DOWN LAUNDRY, TOO.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.672
THEN CAN HE ALSO BUILD ME

08:23.670 --> 08:25.672
ANOTHER BOOKSHELF?

08:25.713 --> 08:28.758
I'VE NEVER BEEN PROUDER OF YOU

08:25.713 --> 08:28.758
THAN I AM AT THIS MOMENT.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.052
AND TELL HIM TO PAINT LITTLE

08:28.800 --> 08:31.052
FLOWERS ON IT.

08:31.094 --> 08:34.555
'CAUSE HE'S SO GOOD

08:31.094 --> 08:34.555
WITH THE FLORALS.

08:31.094 --> 08:34.555
HELLO?

08:34.597 --> 08:38.143
I FINISHED THE PAPER ON

08:34.597 --> 08:38.143
DICKINSON, THE PHYSICS TEST

08:34.597 --> 08:38.143
WAS FOR A THIRD GRADER,

08:38.185 --> 08:41.646
I PICKED THE HISTORY OF THE

08:38.185 --> 08:41.646
EGYPTIAN POLITICAL PROCESS AS MY

08:38.185 --> 08:41.646
INTERNATIONAL-HISTORY PROJECT.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.690
YOU'VE BEEN VERY BUSY.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.690
I'VE BEEN VERY BORED.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.900
WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK

08:43.731 --> 08:45.900
TO SCHOOL?

08:45.942 --> 08:48.111
TOMORROW. MY MOM'S

08:45.942 --> 08:48.111
BRINGING HOME A NEW FACE.

08:48.153 --> 08:48.903
REALLY?

08:48.945 --> 08:51.072
THERE'S A DOCTOR IN FRANCE

08:51.114 --> 08:54.242
WHO INJECTS SOME KIND OF GEL

08:51.114 --> 08:54.242
INTO YOUR HEAD AND THEN MOLDS IT

08:51.114 --> 08:54.242
TO GIVE YOU BETTER CHEEKBONES.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.328
SHE NEEDS TO SLEEP ON HER BACK.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.831
OTHERWISE, HER FACE WILL

08:56.370 --> 08:59.831
FLATTEN LIKE A CREPE.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.831
OH, MY GOD. IT'S "BRAZIL."

08:59.873 --> 09:03.918
I'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO GO BACK TO

08:59.873 --> 09:03.918
SCHOOL WHEN THEY GET HOME.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.918
IT WILL BE FINE.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.046
ARE PEOPLE STILL TALKING ABOUT

09:03.960 --> 09:06.046
MY MELTDOWN SPEECH?

09:06.087 --> 09:06.963
NO.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.048
GREAT.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.508
WHO CARES WHAT THEY'RE

09:08.089 --> 09:09.508
SAYING, PARIS?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.219
GIVE ME MORE HOMEWORK.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.219
IT'LL KEEP MY MIND OFF MY LIFE.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.971
THERE IS NO MORE. I THINK

09:12.260 --> 09:14.971
YOU'VE ALMOST FINISHED

09:12.260 --> 09:14.971
YOUR FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.391
I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.391
I'LL GO CRAZY.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.643
WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT

09:17.432 --> 09:20.643
AND DO SOMETHING FUN?

09:17.432 --> 09:20.643
LIKE WHAT?

09:20.685 --> 09:25.023
IT'S YOUR LAST DAY OF FREEDOM.

09:20.685 --> 09:25.023
GO BE WILD, GO CRAZY.

09:20.685 --> 09:25.023
DON'T THINK, JUST DO.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.274
DO WHAT?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.274
YOU'RE THINKING.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.484
BUT...

09:26.316 --> 09:27.484
STILL THINKING.

09:27.526 --> 09:28.609
WHAT IF --

09:28.651 --> 09:30.611
PARIS, DON'T THINK.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.611
OKAY, I WON'T THINK.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.031
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.409
DO YOU THINK LUKE CAN

09:33.073 --> 09:35.409
KNOCK THIS WALL OUT

09:35.450 --> 09:37.702
AND BUILD US A BIGGER

09:35.450 --> 09:37.702
KITCHEN IN FIVE HOURS?

09:37.744 --> 09:41.122
YOU'LL HAVE TO DROP THE LAUNDRY.

09:37.744 --> 09:41.122
NEVER MIND.

09:37.744 --> 09:41.122
OH, MY GOD, I'M EXHAUSTED.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.583
ARE YOU TOO EXHAUSTED TO TALK

09:41.164 --> 09:43.583
ABOUT BIRTHDAY WEEK?

09:43.624 --> 09:45.919
I'M NEVER TOO TIRED TO TALK

09:43.624 --> 09:45.919
ABOUT BIRTHDAY WEEK.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.380
OKAY, SO, MONDAY I

09:45.960 --> 09:48.380
THOUGHT WE'D START

09:48.422 --> 09:50.215
WITH FACIALS AT SLOOPY'S

09:48.422 --> 09:50.215
AFTER SCHOOL.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.008
MUDPACK MONDAY.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.008
I LOVE IT.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.101
D-DAY.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.101
B-D-DAY.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.437
CULMINATING IN THE

10:01.142 --> 10:03.437
FABULOUS BLOWOUT

10:03.478 --> 10:04.645
OF A PARTY

10:03.478 --> 10:04.645
YOU'RE PLANNING.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.773
OH, I'M SORRY.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.773
YOU WANTED A PARTY?

10:06.814 --> 10:08.108
I TOLD EVERYONE YOU DIDN'T WANT

10:08.149 --> 10:09.984
TO MAKE A BIG DEAL

10:08.149 --> 10:09.984
OUT OF YOUR BIRTHDAY THIS YEAR.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.362
MISS PATTY AND BABETTE WANTED TO

10:10.026 --> 10:12.362
HIRE THESE TWO HOT GUYS

10:12.404 --> 10:14.906

10:12.404 --> 10:14.906

10:14.948 --> 10:17.451

10:17.492 --> 10:21.329
RESPECT THE LADY'S WISHES.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.956
SHE DESERVES THAT AT HER AGE."

10:22.997 --> 10:24.499
WHY ARE YOU SO CRUEL?

10:24.541 --> 10:25.375
I HAVE TO GO.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.834
WHERE?

10:25.417 --> 10:26.834
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.632
TELL PEOPLE I JUST COULDN'T

10:29.546 --> 10:32.632
ACCEPT A NEW CAR.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.469
IT WOULD BE BENEATH ME, AND I'D

10:32.673 --> 10:35.469
BE COMPLETELY HUMILIATED.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.179
AND A CONVERTIBLE WOULD JUST

10:35.510 --> 10:38.179
MAKE ME FLING MYSELF

10:38.221 --> 10:39.431
OFF A BUILDING.

10:39.473 --> 10:40.932

YOUR FATHER.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.732

WELL, HE'D LIKE TO SET UP

11:07.834 --> 11:10.337
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:07.834 --> 11:10.337
SHE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.631
TELL HER I'LL MEET HER

11:10.378 --> 11:12.631

11:18.719 --> 11:21.973
YOU WERE SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO

11:18.719 --> 11:21.973
THIS WOMAN WHILE SHE CALLED ME?

11:22.015 --> 11:25.185
SHE'S MY SECRETARY, LORELAI.

11:22.015 --> 11:25.185
YOU WERE SITTING

11:22.015 --> 11:25.185
RIGHT THERE?

11:25.226 --> 11:28.771
THIS IS THE WAY A PROPER

11:25.226 --> 11:28.771
BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.771
TWO FEET FROM THE PHONE.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.858
I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE WITH YOU.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.858
ARE YOU AVAILABLE

11:28.813 --> 11:31.858
TOMORROW OR NOT?

11:31.899 --> 11:34.653
WHAT IS THIS, DAD?

11:31.899 --> 11:34.653
I HAVE SOMETHING

11:31.899 --> 11:34.653
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.904
DISCUSS IT NOW.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.904
I DON'T HAVE TIME NOW.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.491
PUT MRS. HUH-WIGGINS ON

11:36.946 --> 11:39.491

11:39.533 --> 11:42.952
CAN YOU MEET ME TOMORROW

11:39.533 --> 11:42.952

11:39.533 --> 11:42.952
FINE. WHERE?

11:42.994 --> 11:46.498

11:42.994 --> 11:46.498
TOMORROW TO CONFIRM IT

11:42.994 --> 11:46.498
AND TELL YOU THE PLACE.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.375
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST

11:46.540 --> 11:48.375
TELL ME NOW?

11:48.416 --> 11:50.669
LEAVE ME JUST A SEMBLANCE OF

11:48.416 --> 11:50.669
MY STRUCTURE, PLEASE.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.880
FINE. I'LL TALK TO THE WOMAN

11:50.709 --> 11:53.880
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU TOMORROW.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.595
SO THAT'S A 4-FOOT

11:58.635 --> 12:00.595

12:00.637 --> 12:03.390

12:00.637 --> 12:03.390
CUPCAKES ON TOP

12:03.431 --> 12:08.061
SPELLING OUT "HAPPY 16th

12:03.431 --> 12:08.061
BIRTHDAY, LORELAI.

12:03.431 --> 12:08.061
THAT'S RIGHT.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.813
WOULD YOU LIKE BUTTERCREAM OR

12:08.102 --> 12:10.813
WHIP-CREAM FROSTING ON THAT?

12:10.855 --> 12:13.358
CAN YOU DO BOTH?

12:10.855 --> 12:13.358
THAT'S A LOT OF FROSTING.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.402
I KNOW, BUT IT'S MY MOM'S

12:13.400 --> 12:15.402
FAVORITE PART.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.196
ONCE WE TRIED TO MAKE A CAKE

12:15.443 --> 12:18.196
ENTIRELY OUT OF FROSTING,

12:18.238 --> 12:21.282
WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE BETTER IN

12:18.238 --> 12:21.282
THEORY THAN IN ACTUAL EXECUTION.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.368
WELL, BOTH FROSTINGS

12:21.324 --> 12:23.368
IT IS THEN.

12:23.410 --> 12:27.205
WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT IT?

12:23.410 --> 12:27.205
MISS PATTY WILL PICK IT UP

12:23.410 --> 12:27.205
AROUND 5:00.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.165
YOU'RE ALL SET.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.165
THANKS, FRAN.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.417
WE HAVE A GLITCH.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.959
WHAT?

12:32.001 --> 12:34.212
APPARENTLY, THE WORLD'S LARGEST

12:32.001 --> 12:34.212
PIZZA WAS 122 FEET, 8 INCHES.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.796
WHAT?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.796
IT SAYS IT RIGHT THERE.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.632
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,

12:35.838 --> 12:37.632
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.552
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE IT THE

12:37.674 --> 12:40.552
LARGEST PIZZA IN CONNECTICUT.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.137
ACTUALLY, LITCHFIELD MADE ONE

12:40.594 --> 12:43.137
LAST YEAR THAT WAS 98 FEET.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.098
THE BEST THEY COULD DO

12:43.179 --> 12:45.098
WAS A 12 FOOTER.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.683
MAYBE YOU COULD MAKE HER

12:45.139 --> 12:46.683
THE BIGGEST SOMETHING ELSE.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.185
LIKE WHAT?

12:46.725 --> 12:49.185
TACO?

12:49.227 --> 12:51.396
THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE

12:49.227 --> 12:51.396
DIFFICULT TO SERVE.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.440
IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE MORE

12:51.438 --> 12:53.440
OF A COMMITMENT.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.774
WE'LL JUST TELL HER IT'S

12:53.481 --> 12:55.774
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST PIZZA.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.736
LIE?

12:55.816 --> 12:57.736
IT'S FOR HER OWN GOOD.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.446
HOW'S THE MUSIC

12:57.776 --> 12:59.446
SELECTION COMING?

12:59.487 --> 13:01.281
GOOD. I'VE DECIDED

12:59.487 --> 13:01.281
TO CHOOSE ONE SONG

13:01.322 --> 13:02.865
FROM EACH YEAR IN

13:01.322 --> 13:02.865
LORELAI'S LIFE.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.992
I'VE HIT A SNAG IN 1974.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.992
BAD YEAR?

13:05.034 --> 13:07.328
IT'S MAKING THE YEAR OF

13:05.034 --> 13:07.328
THE MACARENA LOOK INSPIRED.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.248
CAN YOU STASH THIS AT YOUR

13:07.370 --> 13:10.248
HOUSE TILL THE PARTY?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.125
IRONIC, ISN'T IT --

13:12.166 --> 13:14.168
YOU HAVING TO HIDE

13:12.166 --> 13:14.168
THINGS AT MY HOUSE?

13:14.210 --> 13:15.670
LIFE HAS COME FULL CIRCLE.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.465
HEY, I GOT THE VIDEO

13:15.712 --> 13:18.465

13:18.506 --> 13:20.759
NO, NOT AGAIN.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.759
I CAN'T HELP IT.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.759
I'M ADDICTED.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.552
IF I'M GOING TO SPEND

13:20.799 --> 13:22.552
TWO HOURS

13:22.594 --> 13:24.262
WATCHING KATE HUDSON COMMIT

13:22.594 --> 13:24.262
SUICIDE AGAIN,

13:24.304 --> 13:25.888
THEN WE ARE ORDERING

13:24.304 --> 13:25.888
INDIAN FOOD.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.682
LAST NIGHT, WHEN

13:25.930 --> 13:27.682
WE WATCHED "ED WOOD,"

13:27.724 --> 13:29.726
WE GOT BURGERS

13:27.724 --> 13:29.726

13:29.768 --> 13:33.313

13:29.768 --> 13:33.313

13:33.354 --> 13:36.149

13:36.190 --> 13:39.611
OKAY, I'VE GOTTA GO.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.611

13:39.653 --> 13:42.781
SO, IT'S BEEN A COUPLE DAYS

13:39.653 --> 13:42.781
SINCE YOU MADE THE BIG DECISION.

13:42.821 --> 13:44.949
YOU STILL GOING TO YALE?

13:42.821 --> 13:44.949
YES, I AM.

13:44.991 --> 13:48.035
IT'S GOT ALL THE CLASSES I WANT

13:44.991 --> 13:48.035
AND SOME REALLY GREAT TEACHERS.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.664
PLUS, AS AN ADDED BONUS,

13:48.077 --> 13:50.664
IT'S REALLY CLOSE TO HERE.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.540
22.8 MILES.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.540
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

13:52.582 --> 13:53.792
DO YOU YAHOO!?

13:53.832 --> 13:55.126
YOU LOOKED IT UP?

13:53.832 --> 13:55.126
YEAH.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.086
YOU LOOKED IT UP.

13:57.128 --> 14:00.423
I JUST HIT A COUPLE BUTTONS

13:57.128 --> 14:00.423
ON A COMPUTER.

13:57.128 --> 14:00.423
YOU LOOKED IT UP.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.842
I WAS BORED. THERE WAS NOTHING

14:00.465 --> 14:03.842
ON TV, AND I WAS FOOLING AROUND.

14:03.884 --> 14:07.764
IT WAS SOMETHING TO DO.

14:03.884 --> 14:07.764
THAT'S IT.

14:03.884 --> 14:07.764
YOU LOOKED IT UP.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.183
I'D LIKE THE WORDING TO BE

14:07.806 --> 14:10.183
A LITTLE HARSHER.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.770
TAYLOR, IT ALREADY SAYS

14:10.224 --> 14:13.770
THAT IF AUNT TILLY'S TAFFY

14:10.224 --> 14:13.770

14:13.812 --> 14:15.814
THEY FORFEIT ALL PAYMENT FOR

14:13.812 --> 14:15.814
THAT PARTICULAR SHIPMENT

14:15.854 --> 14:18.733
AND ARE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF

14:15.854 --> 14:18.733
INCOME THAT MAY RESULT.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.276
IT'S PRETTY EXTREME.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.695
WELL, IT MAY SEEM EXTREME

14:21.736 --> 14:23.904
THESE CANDY PEOPLE ARE

14:21.736 --> 14:23.904
SHIFTY CHARACTERS.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.616
WHY DON'T WE LEAVE THE

14:23.946 --> 14:26.616
WORDING LIKE IT IS FOR NOW

14:23.946 --> 14:26.616
AND SEE HOW THINGS GO?

14:26.658 --> 14:28.326
WE CAN ALWAYS GET TOUGHER

14:26.658 --> 14:28.326
LATER IF NECESSARY.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.870
YEAH, YOU CAN SEND OVER A COUPLE

14:28.368 --> 14:30.870

14:30.911 --> 14:32.913
TO KICK THE CRAP OUT OF

14:30.911 --> 14:32.913
AUNT TILLY.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.791
ARE YOU STILL DATING HIM?

14:32.955 --> 14:34.791
YES, I AM.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.626
WHY?

14:34.833 --> 14:36.626
TAYLOR.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.003
IF YOU'RE LONELY,

14:36.668 --> 14:39.003
I HAVE A NEPHEW I WOULD

14:36.668 --> 14:39.003
LOVE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.217
CAN I GIVE HIM YOUR NUMBER?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.217
NO.

14:44.258 --> 14:47.345
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

14:44.258 --> 14:47.345
IT'S MY LUCKY DAY.

14:44.258 --> 14:47.345
IS HE DONE?

14:47.387 --> 14:50.390
WE'LL LEAVE IT YOUR WAY

14:47.387 --> 14:50.390
AND SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.101
SO, LISTEN, AFTER I DISPOSE OF

15:16.957 --> 15:19.502
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT TO

15:16.957 --> 15:19.502
MEET YOUR PARENTS.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.714
IT'S JUST THAT I HAVEN'T MET ANY

15:19.544 --> 15:22.714

17:10.404 --> 17:12.573
YOU WHAT?

17:10.404 --> 17:12.573
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

17:12.615 --> 17:15.368
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME TO GO OUT

17:12.615 --> 17:15.368
AND DO SOMETHING CRAZY.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.746
I MEANT HAVE SOME ICE CREAM, SEE

17:15.409 --> 17:18.746
THREE MOVIES, BUY A NEW PURSE.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.332
I DIDN'T MEAN POKE

17:18.788 --> 17:21.332
A THIRD HOLE IN YOUR NOSE.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.877
I DIDN'T BUY A NEW PURSE.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.877
I PIERCED MY NOSE.

17:23.918 --> 17:27.463
AND WITHIN AN HOUR MY NOSE

17:23.918 --> 17:27.463
SWELLED UP TO FOUR TIMES ITS

17:23.918 --> 17:27.463
NORMAL SIZE,

17:27.505 --> 17:29.757
BLOCKING ALL NASAL PASSAGES,

17:27.505 --> 17:29.757
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BREATHE.

17:29.799 --> 17:33.594
I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM,

17:29.799 --> 17:33.594
WHERE THEY PRIED THE THING

17:29.799 --> 17:33.594
OUT OF MY NOSE.

17:33.636 --> 17:36.681
I SPENT THE NIGHT WITH AN ICE

17:33.636 --> 17:36.681
PACK STRAPPED TO MY FACE.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.559
IT SEEMS THAT I WAS ALLERGIC TO

17:36.723 --> 17:39.559
THE CRAP METAL HOOP

17:39.600 --> 17:43.646
THAT I PAID $19.95 TO HAVE

17:39.600 --> 17:43.646
JAMMED INTO MY NOSE.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.646
DID YOU TAKE A PICTURE?

17:43.688 --> 17:47.525
I WAS A LITTLE BUSY TRYING TO

17:43.688 --> 17:47.525
GET AIR TO MY BRAIN CELLS.

17:47.567 --> 17:51.529
PARIS, I'M SO SORRY.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.198
GOOD. I CAUGHT YOU.

17:54.240 --> 17:58.285
THERE'S A BIT OF A DESIGN FLAW

17:54.240 --> 17:58.285
IN THE PIZZA HERE.

17:54.240 --> 17:58.285
WHAT KIND OF DESIGN FLAW?

17:58.327 --> 18:02.164
THE CRUST IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE

17:58.327 --> 18:02.164
TO SUPPORT ALL THE TOPPINGS

17:58.327 --> 18:02.164
WE TALKED ABOUT.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.251
WE MIGHT NEED TO PUT IN

18:02.206 --> 18:05.251
A SECOND CRUST.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.251
A SECOND CRUST?

18:05.292 --> 18:08.379
ABOUT 3/4 OF THE WAY IN --

18:05.292 --> 18:08.379
SORT OF LIKE A RETAINING WALL.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.339

18:12.050 --> 18:15.135

18:12.050 --> 18:15.135
THAT MIGHT DO IT.

18:15.177 --> 18:19.515

18:15.177 --> 18:19.515
FOR A WHILE AND GET BACK TO YOU.

YOU'RE SO GOOD.

THE POSSIBILITY

OF JUST PULLING THE SPOON

19:15.404 --> 19:17.197

20:43.201 --> 20:47.246
IN HIS CAR AND DROVE OFF.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.676
YOU GOT THE MEMO OR NOT,

BUT I HAPPEN TO BE

23:13.809 --> 23:15.853
ANOTHER CUP OF COFFEE,

23:13.809 --> 23:15.853
LORELAI?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.855
SO, LORELAI.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.855
SO DAD.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.941
I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME

23:17.897 --> 23:20.941
OUT TO MEET ME LIKE THIS.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.861
I APPRECIATE YOU ACTUALLY

23:20.983 --> 23:23.861
SHOWING UP AND NOT SENDING

23:20.983 --> 23:23.861
YOUR SECRETARY.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.530
I ASSUME YOU'RE WONDERING WHY

23:23.903 --> 23:26.530
I ASKED YOU HERE.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.865
NOT AT ALL.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.201
WELL, I HAVE SOMETHING

23:27.907 --> 23:30.201
FOR YOU.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.078
IS IT A HAT?

23:30.243 --> 23:32.078
NO.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.537
IS IT A PURSE?

23:32.119 --> 23:33.537
NO.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.872
LORELAI...

23:34.914 --> 23:36.374
GEORGE FOREMAN GRILL?

23:36.414 --> 23:38.542
WHEN YOU WERE BORN, I DECIDED

23:36.414 --> 23:38.542
TO CELEBRATE,

23:38.584 --> 23:40.878
SO AS SOON AS YOUR

23:38.584 --> 23:40.878
MOTHER WENT TO SLEEP,

23:40.920 --> 23:43.297
I LEFT THE HOSPITAL,

23:40.920 --> 23:43.297
I CALLED MY BUSINESS MANAGER,

23:43.339 --> 23:44.882
AND I MADE A REAL-ESTATE

23:43.339 --> 23:44.882
INVESTMENT.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.926
YOU DO KNOW HOW TO PARTY,

23:44.924 --> 23:46.926
DON'T YOU?

23:46.967 --> 23:48.761
I MADE THIS INVESTMENT

23:46.967 --> 23:48.761
IN YOUR NAME.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.888
WOW. MOST PEOPLE JUST BUY

23:48.802 --> 23:50.888
A STUFFED BEAR.

23:50.930 --> 23:51.513
THIS IS BETTER.

23:51.555 --> 23:52.932
I THOUGHT SO.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.684
ANYHOW, A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

23:52.973 --> 23:55.684
I GOT A LETTER FROM A LAWYER

23:55.726 --> 23:57.519
WHO WAS REPRESENTING

23:55.726 --> 23:57.519
THE INVESTMENT GROUP,

23:57.561 --> 23:59.855
INFORMING ME THAT THE

23:57.561 --> 23:59.855
GOVERNMENT IS BUILDING A ROAD

23:59.897 --> 24:01.815
RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF

23:59.897 --> 24:01.815
YOUR INVESTMENT.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.192
HOW SAD.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.319
WHICH MEANS THAT THE COMPLEX

24:03.234 --> 24:05.319
HAS BEEN SOLD

24:05.361 --> 24:07.821
AND ALL THE INVESTORS WILL BE

24:05.361 --> 24:07.821
RECEIVING A CHECK.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.156
HAPPY.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.158
SINCE YOU ARE ONE OF

24:09.198 --> 24:11.158
THE INVESTORS...

24:11.200 --> 24:13.202
I GET A CHECK?

24:11.200 --> 24:13.202
YOU GET A CHECK.

24:13.244 --> 24:14.870
WOW! THAT'S...

24:18.291 --> 24:20.000
$75,000?

24:20.042 --> 24:23.461
YES, IT IS.

24:20.042 --> 24:23.461
I GET $75,000 FOR

24:20.042 --> 24:23.461
BEING BORN?

24:23.503 --> 24:25.547
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

24:23.503 --> 24:25.547
A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.259
THIS IS $75,000.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.259
$75--

24:28.301 --> 24:29.843
DO YOU HAVE A PEN?

24:29.885 --> 24:31.637
WHY, YES, I DO.

24:31.678 --> 24:33.806
$75,000, $75,000.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.766
OH, MY GOD.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.769
THAT'S, LIKE, 150 PAIRS

24:35.808 --> 24:38.769
OF JIMMY CHOOS.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.478
WHAT ARE JIMMY CHOOS?

24:38.811 --> 24:40.478
SHOES.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.148
150 PAIRS? THAT'S IT?

24:42.189 --> 24:43.857
DAD, THEY'RE JIMMY CHOOS.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.152
FOR $75,000, YOU SHOULD

24:43.899 --> 24:46.152
BE ABLE TO BUY

24:46.193 --> 24:48.446
AT LEAST 300 OR 400

24:46.193 --> 24:48.446
PAIRS OF SHOES.

24:48.486 --> 24:50.239
NOT JIMMY CHOOS.

24:48.486 --> 24:50.239
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

24:50.281 --> 24:53.075
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SPEND

24:50.281 --> 24:53.075
$75,000 ON JIMMY CHOOS

24:53.117 --> 24:55.828
WHEN YOU COULD BUY 400 PAIRS

24:53.117 --> 24:55.828
OF LESS PRESTIGIOUS --

24:55.869 --> 24:58.622
BUT I AM SURE --

24:55.869 --> 24:58.622
EQUALLY STYLISH SHOES.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.707
YOU WILL SHOP AROUND FIRST.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.707
IS THAT CLEAR?

25:00.749 --> 25:02.793
YES, SIR.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.793
ALRIGHT, THEN

25:00.749 --> 25:02.793
IT'S SETTLED.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.338
LISTEN, DAD, THIS MONEY

25:02.835 --> 25:05.338
ISN'T, UH...

25:05.379 --> 25:07.547
IT ISN'T SOME KIND OF

25:05.379 --> 25:07.547
GIFT, IS IT?

25:07.589 --> 25:09.300
GIFT?

25:07.589 --> 25:09.300
LIKE A BIRTHDAY GIFT.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.844
BECAUSE IF IT IS, IT'S TOO

25:09.342 --> 25:11.844
MUCH, AND I CAN'T.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.054
I MADE THIS INVESTMENT

25:11.885 --> 25:14.054
IN YOUR NAME.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.140
YOU RECEIVED A CHECK.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.892
LEGALLY, I'M OBLIGATED

25:16.182 --> 25:18.892
TO GIVE YOU THAT.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.811
THIS ISN'T CHARITY

25:18.934 --> 25:20.811
OR GENEROSITY.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.229
IT IS THE LAW.

25:22.271 --> 25:25.816
IT'S THE LAW THAT I GET

25:22.271 --> 25:25.816
TO KEEP $75,000.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.276
ENJOY THE SHOES.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.031
WE COULD BUY A BOAT.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.491
WE COULD, BUT WHY?

25:33.531 --> 25:35.617
BECAUSE RICH PEOPLE ALWAYS

25:33.531 --> 25:35.617
HAVE A BOAT.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.744
WE COULD PARK IT

25:35.659 --> 25:37.744
IN THE FRONT YARD.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.330
YEAH, LIKE WHITE-TRASH

25:37.786 --> 25:39.330
RICH PEOPLE.

25:39.372 --> 25:41.539
GOD, THIS IS AMAZING.

25:39.372 --> 25:41.539
NO MORE CLIPPING COUPONS.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.917
NO MORE PICKING LOOSE CHANGE

25:41.581 --> 25:43.917
UP OFF THE GROUND,

25:43.959 --> 25:46.086
NO MORE DRIVING AROUND LOOKING

25:43.959 --> 25:46.086
FOR CHEAP GAS.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.088
WHICH TOTALLY DEFEATS

25:46.128 --> 25:48.088
THE PURPOSE,

25:48.130 --> 25:51.217
SINCE YOU WIND UP USING MORE GAS

25:48.130 --> 25:51.217
LOOKING FOR THE CHEAP GAS.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.676
$75,000.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.762
I FEEL SO RICH...AND SUDDENLY IN

25:52.718 --> 25:55.762
COMPLETE AGREEMENT

25:55.804 --> 25:57.890
WITH EVERYTHING BUSH HAS

25:55.804 --> 25:57.890
TO SAY.

25:57.931 --> 25:59.141
I'LL GET IT.

25:59.183 --> 26:00.851
NO!

25:59.183 --> 26:00.851
MORE SECRET BIRTHDAY CALLS.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.645
NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.645
IT COULD BE JESS.

26:03.687 --> 26:04.897
IT'S ABOUT ME.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.690
IT COULD BE LANE.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.690
IT'S ABOUT ME.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.734
IT COULD BE PARIS.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.734
IT COULD BE MADELINE.

26:08.775 --> 26:10.777
IT COULD BE A MYRIAD OF

26:08.775 --> 26:10.777
OTHER PEOPLE

26:10.819 --> 26:13.030
WANTING ONLY TO TALK TO

26:10.819 --> 26:13.030
ME ABOUT ME.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.449
IT'S ABOUT ME.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.951
HELLO?

26:15.491 --> 26:17.951
RORY, WE GOT

26:15.491 --> 26:17.951
A BIG<i> PROBLEMO.</i>

26:17.993 --> 26:19.370
WHAT'S THE MATTER, PETE?

26:19.412 --> 26:21.579
WE DID A TRIAL RUN

26:19.412 --> 26:21.579
OF THE PIZZA.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.207
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

26:21.621 --> 26:23.207
EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT THERE

26:23.249 --> 26:24.291
FOR THE BIG DAY, YOU KNOW?

26:24.333 --> 26:25.418
I APPRECIATE THAT.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.044
SO WE MADE A TRIAL PIZZA,

26:27.086 --> 26:29.838
AND KIRK BUILT A PIZZA RACK

26:27.086 --> 26:29.838
ON TOP OF HIS CAR.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.757
YOU WITH ME?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.757
LIKE A BAD HABIT.

26:31.798 --> 26:34.051
SO AS KIRK'S PUTTING

26:31.798 --> 26:34.051
THE PIZZA ON THE RACK,

26:34.093 --> 26:35.761
THE THING COLLAPSES,

26:34.093 --> 26:35.761
THE PIZZA SLIPS.

26:35.802 --> 26:38.556
LONG STORY SHORT -- KIRK HAS GOT

26:35.802 --> 26:38.556
SOME SEVERE CHEESE BURNS.

26:38.596 --> 26:40.516
OH, MY GOD.

26:38.596 --> 26:40.516
IS HE ALRIGHT?

26:40.558 --> 26:42.268
OH!

26:40.558 --> 26:42.268
WHO KNOWS?

26:42.309 --> 26:45.521
THE POINT IS I THINK THE PIZZA

26:42.309 --> 26:45.521
NEEDS TO BE CHEESELESS

26:45.563 --> 26:47.689
AND POSSIBLY SAUCELESS.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.816
THE THING'S A HAZARD, BABE.

26:49.858 --> 26:53.153
DID IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT THE

26:49.858 --> 26:53.153
PROBLEM MAY NOT BE THE PIZZA.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.072
IT MAY BE KIRK.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.072
NO.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.490
WELL, IT SHOULD HAVE.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.576
THE PIZZA HAS TO HAVE

26:56.532 --> 26:58.576
CHEESE AND SAUCE.

26:58.616 --> 27:00.369
OTHERWISE, IT'S NOT A PIZZA.

26:58.616 --> 27:00.369
IT'S BREAD.

27:00.411 --> 27:02.913
IF YOU'RE GONNA INSIST ON

27:00.411 --> 27:02.913
THE CHEESE AND THE SAUCE,

27:02.955 --> 27:05.291
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PROVIDE

27:02.955 --> 27:05.291
THE TRANSPORTATION YOURSELF.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.126
FINE, PETE.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.126
I WILL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.586
ROGER, WILCO,<i> SENORITA.</i>

27:08.626 --> 27:10.879
WHO WAS IT?

27:10.921 --> 27:12.214
ASTRID FROM SCHOOL.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.049
SHE'S LEAVING FOR EUROPE

27:12.256 --> 27:14.049
FOR A WEEK,

27:14.091 --> 27:16.885
AND SHE WANTS ME TO TAKE NOTES

27:14.091 --> 27:16.885
AND E-MAIL HER EVERYTHING.

27:16.927 --> 27:18.512
IT WAS ABOUT ME.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.642
HEY.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.642
HEY, YOU'RE HOME LATE.

27:24.684 --> 27:25.936
TRAFFIC.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.772
YOU HUNGRY?

27:25.978 --> 27:28.772
I'M MEETING RORY.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.566
WANT ME TO MAKE YOU

27:28.814 --> 27:30.566
SOME SANDWICHES?

27:30.608 --> 27:33.651
SO WE CAN BROWN-BAG IT

27:30.608 --> 27:33.651
ON OUR DATE? I DON'T THINK SO.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.154
HOW WAS WORK?

27:35.195 --> 27:36.989
THE CLEANED-UP VERSION OF

27:35.195 --> 27:36.989
"THE EMINEM SHOW"

27:37.030 --> 27:38.532
SEEMS TO BE

27:37.030 --> 27:38.532
SELLING PRETTY WELL,

27:38.574 --> 27:40.826
SO THE WORLD IS BASICALLY

27:38.574 --> 27:40.826
COMING TO AN END.

27:40.867 --> 27:43.370
SO, LISTEN, I WANT TO TALK

27:40.867 --> 27:43.370
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

27:43.412 --> 27:44.997
TALK.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.374
COULD YOU STOP GROOMING FOR

27:45.038 --> 27:47.374
JUST A SECOND, PLEASE?

27:47.416 --> 27:48.959
I'M ALREADY LATE.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.253
I WAS DOING SOME THINKING

27:49.001 --> 27:51.253
ABOUT YOUR SITUATION.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.046
MY SITUATION?

27:53.088 --> 27:55.341
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WORKING HERE,

27:53.088 --> 27:55.341
YOU'RE WORKING AT WAL-MART,

27:55.382 --> 27:58.344
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A LOT.

27:58.385 --> 28:01.138
YOU EVER WORRY THAT IF A BIRD

27:58.385 --> 28:01.138
FLIES INTO YOUR HEAD,

28:01.180 --> 28:02.889
IT MIGHT

28:01.180 --> 28:02.889
NEVER GET OUT AGAIN?

28:02.931 --> 28:06.893
I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD

28:02.931 --> 28:06.893
MAKE THINGS A LITTLE EASIER.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.770
HOW?

28:08.812 --> 28:11.607
WELL, I COULD, UH, GIVE YOU

28:08.812 --> 28:11.607
A RAISE AT THE DINER.

28:11.649 --> 28:13.775
AND MAYBE HELP OUT

28:13.817 --> 28:16.278
WITH SOME OF THE, YOU KNOW,

28:13.817 --> 28:16.278
BIGGER MONEY BURDENS,

28:16.320 --> 28:17.655
LIKE YOUR CAR INSURANCE.

28:17.695 --> 28:19.448
WHY WOULD YOU WANT

28:17.695 --> 28:19.448
TO DO THAT?

28:19.490 --> 28:21.992
SO YOU CAN QUIT YOUR JOB

28:19.490 --> 28:21.992
AT WAL-MART.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.992
NO WAY.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.370
BUT YOU'D STILL BE MAKING

28:22.034 --> 28:24.370
MONEY, AND THIS WAY,

28:24.411 --> 28:27.956
YOU GET TO SPEND MORE TIME

28:24.411 --> 28:27.956
ON RORY...AND SCHOOL.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.291
I'M FINE.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.669
JESS, COME ON.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.669
TAKE THE DEAL.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.337
I HAVE TO CHANGE.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.255
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING

28:33.379 --> 28:35.255
TO SCHOOL.

28:35.297 --> 28:37.799
I SAW YOU GET IN YOUR CAR

28:35.297 --> 28:37.799
AND DRIVE OFF.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.843
YOU'RE SPYING ON ME?

28:37.841 --> 28:39.843
YOU LIED TO ME.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.137
ONCE IN A WHILE, I TAKE

28:39.885 --> 28:42.137
AN EXTRA SHIFT.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.056
I GO ENOUGH.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.056
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

28:44.097 --> 28:45.599
IT'S PUBLIC SCHOOL.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.685
MY HISTORY TEACHER IS ALSO

28:45.641 --> 28:47.685
THE FOOTBALL COACH.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.896
JESS, WE HAD A DEAL.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.896
YOU GO TO SCHOOL, YOU GRADUATE.

28:50.937 --> 28:52.606
I KNOW. RELAX.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.316
I GOT IT ALL UNDER CONTROL.

28:54.358 --> 28:56.735
I HAVE TO CHANGE.

28:56.776 --> 28:57.944
JESS!

29:00.531 --> 29:02.866
THAT'S RIGHT.

29:00.531 --> 29:02.866
BREAKFAST IS INCLUDED.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.952
THEN AT 5:00, WE INVITE ALL

29:02.908 --> 29:05.952
THE GUESTS TO THE LOBBY

29:05.994 --> 29:08.038
FOR COMPLIMENTARY WINE AND

29:05.994 --> 29:08.038
CHEESE AND MINGLING.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.417
YES, IT IS KIND OF LIKE

29:08.080 --> 29:11.417
A B &amp; B.

29:11.458 --> 29:15.295
OKAY, GREAT.

29:11.458 --> 29:15.295
WE'LL SEE YOU AND SWEETIE THEN.

29:15.337 --> 29:17.005
BYE.

29:17.047 --> 29:21.176
SO, AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO GET

29:17.047 --> 29:21.176
THIS PLACE UP AND RUNNING

29:21.218 --> 29:24.430
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FOR AS

29:21.218 --> 29:24.430
LITTLE MONEY AS POSSIBLE.

29:24.471 --> 29:27.933
SO LAST NIGHT I PULLED OUT

29:24.471 --> 29:27.933
THE OLD "TIME-LIFE" SERIES,

29:27.974 --> 29:31.186
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT THERE'S SOME

29:27.974 --> 29:31.186
PRETTY TERRIFIC IDEAS IN HERE.

29:31.228 --> 29:34.898
FOR EXAMPLE, WE CAN PUTTY UP

29:31.228 --> 29:34.898
THE CRACKS IN THE DRYWALL

29:34.940 --> 29:38.485
AND THEN GIVE THE LOWER PART OF

29:34.940 --> 29:38.485
THE WALL A GOOD COAT OF PAINT.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.613
THEN WE CAN TAKE

29:38.527 --> 29:40.613
A STRIP OF WALLPAPER,

29:40.654 --> 29:44.199
PUT IT AROUND THE TOP, THUS

29:40.654 --> 29:44.199
CREATING SORT OF A BORDER,

29:40.654 --> 29:44.199
IF YOU WILL.

29:44.241 --> 29:47.160
I GATHERED UP ALL THE BROKEN

29:44.241 --> 29:47.160
CHINA FROM THE DINING ROOM,

29:47.202 --> 29:48.746
BECAUSE I READ HERE IN<i> MARTHA</i>

29:48.787 --> 29:51.039
THAT CHIPPED TEA CUPS MAKE GREAT

29:48.787 --> 29:51.039
VOTIVE HOLDERS.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.874
AND WE ALL KNOW WHEN IN DOUBT,

29:52.916 --> 29:54.834
IT'S CANDLES, CANDLES,

29:52.916 --> 29:54.834
CANDLES, RIGHT?

29:54.876 --> 29:57.796
SO I CLEANED THEM UP, FILLED

29:54.876 --> 29:57.796
THEM WITH TEA LIGHTS,

29:57.837 --> 29:59.506
AND I THINK THEY LOOK TERRIFIC.

29:59.548 --> 30:02.092
OH, THE PIECES THAT WERE TOO FAR

29:59.548 --> 30:02.092
GONE TO SAVE --

30:02.134 --> 30:03.677
I JUST SMASHED THEM UP

30:03.719 --> 30:06.764
AND USED THE PIECES

30:03.719 --> 30:06.764
TO MAKE THIS NICE PICTURE FRAME.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.141
THAT'S A GREAT

30:06.805 --> 30:09.141
IDEA TOBIN, REALLY.

30:09.182 --> 30:12.728
UH, LORELAI, I HAVE A LITTLE

30:09.182 --> 30:12.728
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.229
FOR ME?

30:14.271 --> 30:16.856
YES. I WASN'T SURE IT WOULD

30:14.271 --> 30:16.856
GET HERE IN TIME

30:16.898 --> 30:18.567
SINCE I ORDERED IT

30:16.898 --> 30:18.567
FROM MADRID,

30:18.609 --> 30:20.611
BUT THANK GOD IT MADE IT.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.862
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.157
YOU BOUGHT ME A PRESENT?

30:22.904 --> 30:25.157
YES.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.493
YOU'VE NEVER BOUGHT

30:25.198 --> 30:27.493
ME A PRESENT.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.493
I HAVE, TOO.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.161
NOT ONCE IN FIVE YEARS.

30:29.202 --> 30:31.204
JUST OPEN UP THE BAG, PLEASE.

30:34.708 --> 30:36.502
MICHEL, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

30:36.543 --> 30:40.130
YES, WELL, I WANTED IT TO BE

30:36.543 --> 30:40.130
SPECIAL, YOU KNOW,

30:40.172 --> 30:42.215
NOT JUST SOME KNICKKNACK YOU

30:40.172 --> 30:42.215
COULD PICK UP

30:42.257 --> 30:45.302
AT A SUPERMARKET OR A CAR WASH.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.262
WELL, IT'S GREAT.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.262
I LOVE IT.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.431
I MUST SAY, I FEEL

30:47.304 --> 30:49.431
VERY SPOILED --

30:49.473 --> 30:52.225
BEAUTIFUL DAYBOOK,

30:49.473 --> 30:52.225
CAPPUCCINO CANDLE.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.561
OH, THAT REMINDS ME.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.561
I GOT YOU SOMETHING ELSE.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.438
TOBIN, YOU ALREADY

30:54.603 --> 30:56.438
GAVE ME A GIFT.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.981
THAT WAS A PREGIFT.

30:58.023 --> 31:01.610
WHY DON'T YOU SCOOCH JUST

30:58.023 --> 31:01.610
A LITTLE BIT FOR ME?

31:01.652 --> 31:03.487
TOBIN, THIS IS TOO MUCH.

31:03.529 --> 31:06.948
YES, IT IS, BUT I SAW IT, AND IT

31:03.529 --> 31:06.948
JUST SCREAMED "LORELAI."

31:06.990 --> 31:08.701
OKAY, WELL...

31:06.990 --> 31:08.701
[ GIGGLES ]

31:08.742 --> 31:11.286
GOD, THIS IS EXCITING.

31:08.742 --> 31:11.286
I LOVE MY BIRTHDAY.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.496
I HOPE IT FITS.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.706
FITS?

31:13.747 --> 31:14.873
TOBIN, THIS IS AMAZING.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.667
THAT IS THE JACKET THAT

31:14.914 --> 31:16.667
JOE STRUMMER WORE

31:16.709 --> 31:19.419
DURING THE 1979

31:16.709 --> 31:19.419
PEARL HARBOR TOUR.

31:19.461 --> 31:20.796
NO!

31:19.461 --> 31:20.796
YES.

31:20.838 --> 31:22.381
WHO IS JOE STRUMMER?

31:22.422 --> 31:24.966
TELL ME YOU'RE KIDDING.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.966
YOU DID NOT GET ME THIS.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.635
IS HE A HELL'S ANGEL MAN?

31:26.677 --> 31:28.261
JOE STRUMMER IS FROM

31:26.677 --> 31:28.261
THE CLASH.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.555
THE CLASH IS A BAND.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.223
AND A BAND IS --

31:29.596 --> 31:31.223
I KNOW WHAT A BAND IS.

31:31.264 --> 31:33.183
HE JUST DIED AND

31:33.225 --> 31:36.729
RORY AND LANE HAVE BEEN

31:33.225 --> 31:36.729
IN MOURNING FOR MONTHS,

31:33.225 --> 31:36.729
AND NOW I HAVE HIS JACKET.

31:36.770 --> 31:40.273
THIS IS BY FAR THE COOLEST THING

31:36.770 --> 31:40.273
I HAVE EVER GOTTEN.

31:40.315 --> 31:44.110
GOD! OH, SMELL IT.

31:40.315 --> 31:44.110
IT SMELLS LIKE JOE.

31:44.152 --> 31:47.322
WELL, THIS IS WONDERFUL --

31:44.152 --> 31:47.322
TO SMELL LIKE A DEAD GUY.

31:47.364 --> 31:49.658
YOU'LL HAVE TO BEAT THEM OFF

31:47.364 --> 31:49.658
WITH A STICK.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.993
AND THERE'S A LETTER OF

31:49.700 --> 31:51.993
AUTHENTICITY IN THE BAG

31:52.035 --> 31:54.037
AND A PICTURE OF JOE

31:52.035 --> 31:54.037
WEARING THE JACKET,

31:54.079 --> 31:57.374
AND ALSO, THEY THREW IN A BERET

31:54.079 --> 31:57.374
JUST FOR THE HECK OF IT.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.000
TOBIN, YOU ARE GETTING

31:57.416 --> 31:59.000
A HUG.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.378
WELL, I'D FIGHT IT, BUT WHAT'S

31:59.042 --> 32:01.378
THE POINT, RIGHT?

32:01.420 --> 32:03.881
I HAVE TO RUN AN ERRAND.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.048
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

32:05.090 --> 32:07.175
JUST BE HERE

32:05.090 --> 32:07.175
WHEN I GET BACK.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.970
I JUST LOVE THIS JACKET.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.474
NICOLE, YOU'RE --

32:12.639 --> 32:14.474
I AM NOT BEING STUBBORN.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.518
YOU DIDN'T LET ME GET

32:14.516 --> 32:16.518
THE "STUBBORN" OUT.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.103
LUKE, WOULD YOU LIKE

32:16.560 --> 32:18.103
A BLINI?

32:18.144 --> 32:20.397
WHEN YOU SIGN UP TO BECOME

32:18.144 --> 32:20.397
A SURROGATE MOTHER,

32:20.439 --> 32:21.981
YOU ENTER INTO

32:20.439 --> 32:21.981
A BUSINESS AGREEMENT,

32:22.023 --> 32:23.983
AND THE RULES OF BUSINESS

32:22.023 --> 32:23.983
SHOULD APPLY.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.903
YOU AS A LAWYER

32:24.025 --> 32:25.903
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.696
AS A LAWYER, I DO

32:25.944 --> 32:27.696
UNDERSTAND THAT.

32:27.738 --> 32:29.573
AS A HUMAN BEING,

32:27.738 --> 32:29.573
I ALSO UNDERSTAND

32:29.615 --> 32:32.367
THAT WHEN A WOMAN'S ALONE AND

32:29.615 --> 32:32.367
IN NEED OF MONEY

32:32.409 --> 32:34.453
SHE CAN DO THINGS THAT SHE'LL

32:32.409 --> 32:34.453
LATER REGRET.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.037
I COULD GET YOU

32:34.494 --> 32:36.037
SOME CHEESE.

32:36.079 --> 32:38.874
YOU CANNOT FORCE A MOTHER

32:36.079 --> 32:38.874
TO GIVE UP HER CHILD.

32:38.916 --> 32:41.418
IF SHE SIGNED A PAPER SAYING,

32:38.916 --> 32:41.418
"ON APRIL THE 12th,

32:41.460 --> 32:44.504
I AM GIVING BIRTH, AND WHATEVER

32:41.460 --> 32:44.504
COMES OUT, I'M HANDING TO YOU,"

32:44.546 --> 32:46.799
AND YOU PAY HER MONEY

32:44.546 --> 32:46.799
AND HER MEDICAL EXPENSES --

32:46.840 --> 32:49.175
THEY PICK A SUBJECT, AND THEY

32:46.840 --> 32:49.175
ARGUE UNTIL DINNER.

32:49.217 --> 32:52.554
THEN THEY CALL A TRUCE, AND THEY

32:49.217 --> 32:52.554
PICK IT BACK UP FOR DESSERT.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.056
ENOUGH. I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE

32:52.596 --> 32:55.056
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

32:55.098 --> 32:56.934
WHAT CAN I DO WITH

32:55.098 --> 32:56.934
HER, LUKE?

32:56.975 --> 32:59.728
WELL, UH, PROBABLY NOT MUCH.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.396
SO, LUKE, I FEEL LIKE

32:59.770 --> 33:01.396
WE'VE BEEN IGNORING YOU.

33:01.438 --> 33:02.564
THAT'S OK.

33:02.606 --> 33:04.232
NICOLE TOLD US YOU'VE

33:02.606 --> 33:04.232
NEVER BEEN MARRIED.

33:04.274 --> 33:07.068
OR WE COULD TALK ABOUT HOW HE

33:04.274 --> 33:07.068
OWNS HIS OWN DINER.

33:07.110 --> 33:10.989
YOU JUST SIT THERE AND PRETEND

33:07.110 --> 33:10.989
TO BE ASHAMED OF US.

33:11.030 --> 33:13.074
UH, NO, I HAVE

33:11.030 --> 33:13.074
NEVER BEEN MARRIED.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.285
BUT SOMEDAY MAYBE, RIGHT?

33:15.327 --> 33:17.537
MARRIAGE, CHILDREN?

33:17.579 --> 33:20.248
SHE MEANS EVENTUALLY AND WITH

33:17.579 --> 33:20.248
THE WOMAN OF YOUR CHOICE.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.292
THEY WILL NOT BE INVOLVED

33:20.290 --> 33:22.292
IN THE PICKING.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.419
BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING MORE

33:22.334 --> 33:24.419
WONDERFUL THAN MARRIAGE.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.463
THE OTHERS ESCAPED OUT

33:24.461 --> 33:26.463
THE BATHROOM WINDOW.

33:26.505 --> 33:30.258
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING MORE

33:26.505 --> 33:30.258
REWARDING THAN CHILDREN.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.385
YOU JUST CAN'T IMAGINE

33:30.300 --> 33:32.385
UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN THERE.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.972
AND THIS ONE HERE MADE

33:32.427 --> 33:34.972
EVERYTHING IN LIFE WORTH IT.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.682
THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE IS LIKE

33:36.723 --> 33:38.851
THE MOST FABULOUS ROLLER-COASTER

33:36.723 --> 33:38.851
RIDE YOU CAN IMAGINE.

33:38.892 --> 33:42.813
FROM THE TIME THEY'RE BORN TO

33:38.892 --> 33:42.813
THAT FIRST STEP, THE FIRST WORD,

33:42.855 --> 33:44.898
THE FIRST TIME THEY HUG YOU,

33:44.940 --> 33:47.192
THE FIRST TIME THEY PICK OUT

33:44.940 --> 33:47.192
THEIR OWN OUTFITS.

33:47.233 --> 33:49.736
THE FIRST TIME THEY TELL YOU

33:47.233 --> 33:49.736
THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL,

33:49.778 --> 33:52.280
AND THEY GET IN THEIR CAR AND

33:49.778 --> 33:52.280
DRIVE TO WAL-MART.

33:52.322 --> 33:56.201
THEY THINK YOU'RE JUST A MORON,

33:52.322 --> 33:56.201
AND THEY DON'T THINK

33:56.242 --> 34:00.330
THAT MAYBE YOU KNOW

33:56.242 --> 34:00.330
THAT THEY'RE LYING TO YOUR FACE

34:00.372 --> 34:03.000
AND THAT YOU'RE REALLY MAD

34:00.372 --> 34:03.000
BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAD AGREEMENT.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.502
OH, DEAR.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.502
THAT AGREEMENT WAS CLEAR,

34:03.041 --> 34:05.502
VERY CLEAR.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.337
AND THEY KNOW THAT BREAKING

34:05.544 --> 34:07.337
THAT AGREEMENT

34:07.379 --> 34:09.673
IS A VIOLATION OF EVERYTHING

34:07.379 --> 34:09.673
YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.717
OH, YEAH, THAT IS CUTE.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.717
THAT'S JUST DARLING.

34:11.758 --> 34:13.760
I CAN'T WAIT TO EXPERIENCE

34:11.758 --> 34:13.760
THAT AGAIN.

34:17.138 --> 34:20.809
I'M SORRY.

34:17.138 --> 34:20.809
DID SOMEONE MENTION CHEESE?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.778
HEY, GUYS.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.656
RORY, JUST THE LADY WE'RE

34:31.820 --> 34:34.656
LOOKING FOR, WE HAVE A PLAN.

34:34.698 --> 34:36.575
GOOD, 'CAUSE I'VE GOT

34:34.698 --> 34:36.575
A CHECK.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.869
WE'VE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF

34:36.616 --> 34:38.869
TRANSPORTING THE BIG PIZZA.

34:38.911 --> 34:41.747
I WAS OF LITTLE HELP SINCE I'M

34:38.911 --> 34:41.747
CURRENTLY IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN.

34:41.788 --> 34:44.457
INSTEAD OF THIS WHOLE ONE HUGE

34:41.788 --> 34:44.457
PIZZA CONCEPT,

34:44.499 --> 34:47.544
WE'RE GONNA DO 100 LITTLE PIZZAS

34:44.499 --> 34:47.544
ALL SITTING NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

34:47.586 --> 34:48.837
WHAT?

34:47.586 --> 34:48.837
LIKE A PIZZA DOILY.

34:48.879 --> 34:50.589
I DON'T WANT A PIZZA DOILY.

34:50.630 --> 34:51.965
MORE OF A COLLAGE.

34:52.007 --> 34:54.593
I DON'T WANT A PIZZA

34:52.007 --> 34:54.593
COLLAGE EITHER.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.428
HOW 'BOUT WE PUT

34:54.634 --> 34:56.428
THE PIZZAS TOGETHER

34:56.469 --> 34:58.471
AND THEN PUT PEPPERONIS OVER

34:56.469 --> 34:58.471
THE OPEN SPOTS?

34:58.513 --> 35:00.515
SO IT LOOKS LIKE

34:58.513 --> 35:00.515
ONE BIG PIZZA. TRICKY.

35:00.557 --> 35:02.601
OR WE COULD PUT CHEESE

35:00.557 --> 35:02.601
OVER THE HOLES.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.227
DON'T SAY THE "C" WORD.

35:04.269 --> 35:05.812
CHEESE MIGHT FALL

35:04.269 --> 35:05.812
THROUGH THE HOLES.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.439
WE CAN USE SLICES.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.439
THAT'LL WORK.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.315
THAT WILL NOT WORK.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.150
NOW, YOU THREE LISTEN

35:09.357 --> 35:11.150
TO ME.

35:11.192 --> 35:14.237
WE AGREED THAT THIS WAS GOING TO

35:11.192 --> 35:14.237
BE THE WORLD'S LARGEST PIZZA.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.782
NOW, I REALIZE IT CAN BE

35:14.279 --> 35:16.782
THE WORLD'S LARGEST PIZZA

35:16.823 --> 35:18.283
BECAUSE THAT PIZZA WAS INSANE,

35:18.324 --> 35:21.160
BUT IT IS STILL GOING TO BE

35:18.324 --> 35:21.160
CRAZY LARGE.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.746
BUT WE --

35:21.202 --> 35:22.746
NO BUTS!

35:22.788 --> 35:25.082
THAT WAS THE CONCEPT.

35:22.788 --> 35:25.082
GET BACK TO THE CONCEPT.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.876
THIS IS NOT "GANGS OF NEW YORK"

35:25.123 --> 35:27.876
NOW WITH CAMERON DIAZ.

35:27.918 --> 35:30.963
THIS IS "GANGS OF NEW YORK" 20

35:27.918 --> 35:30.963
YEARS AGO WITH MERYL STREEP.

35:31.004 --> 35:34.382
COME BACK, REFOCUS.

35:31.004 --> 35:34.382
REMEMBER THE GOAL.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.217
AM I MAKING MYSELF CLEAR?

35:36.259 --> 35:38.386
CAMERON DIAZ IS HOT.

35:38.428 --> 35:39.638
NOT THE POINT, JOE.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.056
OKAY. JEEZ.

35:41.098 --> 35:43.308
NOW, TONIGHT IS MY MOTHER'S

35:41.098 --> 35:43.308
BIRTHDAY PARTY,

35:43.349 --> 35:45.602
AND THE WHOLE TOWN IS GOING

35:43.349 --> 35:45.602
TO BE THERE,

35:45.644 --> 35:48.187
AND THEY ARE EXPECTING MUSIC,

35:45.644 --> 35:48.187
FAVORS, AND REALLY LARGE PIZZA,

35:48.229 --> 35:49.815
AND THEY WILL NOT BE

35:48.229 --> 35:49.815
DISAPPOINTED.

35:49.856 --> 35:53.693
I DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT,

35:49.856 --> 35:53.693
JUST DO IT!

35:53.735 --> 35:55.487
SOMEHOW I CAN'T PICTURE

35:53.735 --> 35:55.487
MERYL STREEP

35:55.528 --> 35:58.031
WITH LEONARDO DICAPRIO.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.658
I REALLY AM SORRY, NICOLE.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.701
YOUR PARENTS MUST THINK

35:59.699 --> 36:01.701
I'M A LUNATIC.

36:01.743 --> 36:04.537
I DON'T THINK "LUNATIC" WAS

36:01.743 --> 36:04.537
ONE OF THE WORDS THEY USED.

36:04.579 --> 36:07.332
BUT THEY HAVE A VERY

36:04.579 --> 36:07.332
EXTENSIVE VOCABULARY.

36:07.373 --> 36:09.876
IT'S THE FIRST TIME I MEET

36:07.373 --> 36:09.876
THEM, AND I JUST --

36:09.918 --> 36:11.419
JESS WAS DRIVING ME

36:09.918 --> 36:11.419
CRAZY, AND --

36:11.461 --> 36:12.921
I TOLD THEM THIS.

36:12.963 --> 36:15.590
WHEN THEY COME BACK INTO TOWN,

36:12.963 --> 36:15.590
I WILL DO BETTER.

36:15.632 --> 36:17.175
I'M GOING TO SCHOOL.

36:17.216 --> 36:19.719
THEY MAY NOT BE BACK IN TOWN

36:17.216 --> 36:19.719
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.888
WHENEVER.

36:21.930 --> 36:25.308
SO I CAN MAKE ANOTHER LUNCH

36:21.930 --> 36:25.308
DATE WITH MY PARENTS

36:21.930 --> 36:25.308
SEVERAL MONTHS AWAY?

36:25.350 --> 36:27.019
SURE, MAKE IT.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.728
TELL 'EM I'VE GOTTEN

36:27.060 --> 36:28.728
SOME MEDICATION.

36:28.770 --> 36:32.065
I'M MUCH BETTER NOW.

36:28.770 --> 36:32.065
I'LL DO THAT.

36:32.107 --> 36:35.152
GET OFF THE PHONE. I NEED THE

36:32.107 --> 36:35.152
PHONE. GET OFF THE PHONE.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.486
SOMEONE STOLE MY CAR.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.571
NICOLE, I'M GONNA HAVE TO

36:36.528 --> 36:38.571
CALL YOU BACK.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.366
I PARKED IT RIGHT AROUND

36:38.613 --> 36:41.366
THE CORNER, AND NOW IT'S GONE.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.201
WHY'D YOU PARK IT

36:41.407 --> 36:43.201
AROUND THE CORNER?

36:43.242 --> 36:44.953
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

36:43.242 --> 36:44.953
I PARKED IT.

36:44.995 --> 36:47.413
HOW CAN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

36:44.995 --> 36:47.413
HAVE AN ANSWERING MACHINE?

36:47.455 --> 36:48.790
LOOK, LET'S JUST CALM DOWN.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.834
WHO WOULD STEAL THAT CAR?

36:48.832 --> 36:50.834
IT HARDLY RAN.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.628
THESE CHOP SHOPS, THEY CAN MAKE

36:50.876 --> 36:53.628
A BUCK OUT OF ANYTHING.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.463
I AM GONNA KILL

36:53.670 --> 36:55.463
WHOEVER DID THIS.

36:55.505 --> 36:58.257
JUST GO ON OVER TO SCHOOL.

36:55.505 --> 36:58.257
I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

36:58.299 --> 37:01.386
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LATE FOR

36:58.299 --> 37:01.386
YOUR FIRST CLASS, RIGHT?

37:01.427 --> 37:03.638
YOU WERE PLANNING ON

37:01.427 --> 37:03.638
GOING TO SCHOOL, RIGHT?

37:03.680 --> 37:05.807
WELL, THEN JUST WALK ON

37:03.680 --> 37:05.807
OVER TO SCHOOL,

37:05.849 --> 37:07.767
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF

37:05.849 --> 37:07.767
THE REST.

37:07.809 --> 37:10.269
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

37:07.809 --> 37:10.269
STUDY HARD.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.522
DON'T WORRY.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.522
JUST LEAVE THE CAR TO ME.

37:18.444 --> 37:22.281
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR LORELAI ♪

37:22.323 --> 37:25.702
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪

37:27.871 --> 37:30.415
YOU CAN TAKE THE CAKE INTO

37:27.871 --> 37:30.415
THE KITCHEN NOW, TERESA.

37:30.456 --> 37:33.376
AREN'T I SUPPOSED

37:30.456 --> 37:33.376
TO BLOW THEM OUT?

37:30.456 --> 37:33.376
TERESA CAN DO THAT.

37:33.418 --> 37:37.214
IT'S TRADITION FOR THE PERSON

37:33.418 --> 37:37.214
WHOSE NAME IS ON THE CAKE

37:33.418 --> 37:37.214
TO DO THE BLOWING.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.298
I THOUGHT ONLY CHILDREN

37:37.255 --> 37:39.298
LIKE TO DO THAT.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.968
SHALL WE BRING IT BACK OUT

37:39.340 --> 37:41.968
AND RELIGHT IT?

37:39.340 --> 37:41.968
NO.

37:42.010 --> 37:45.805
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE

37:42.010 --> 37:45.805
A WISH AND BLOW OUT THE TAPERS?

37:42.010 --> 37:45.805
WHY AM I BEING MOCKED?

37:45.847 --> 37:47.432
BECAUSE THAT'S

37:45.847 --> 37:47.432
THE GILMORE WAY.

37:47.473 --> 37:50.227
LET'S MOVE INTO THE LIVING ROOM

37:47.473 --> 37:50.227
FOR OUR DESSERT, SHALL WE?

37:50.268 --> 37:51.310
LET'S SHALL.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.524
How are we doing for time?

37:53.772 --> 37:56.524
We've got time for cake.

37:56.566 --> 37:59.819
I don't want to miss the fancy

37:56.566 --> 37:59.819
party you're throwing me.

37:59.861 --> 38:02.197
WHAT ARE THE TWO OF YOU

37:59.861 --> 38:02.197
WHISPERING ABOUT?

37:59.861 --> 38:02.197
NOTHING.

38:02.239 --> 38:03.656
CHAMPAGNE?

38:03.698 --> 38:05.742
TRYING TO GET ME DRUNK

38:03.698 --> 38:05.742
SO I FORGET

38:05.784 --> 38:08.286
THAT YOU WOULDN'T LET ME

38:05.784 --> 38:08.286
BLOW OUT MY OWN CANDLES?

38:08.327 --> 38:10.872
IS THIS GOING TO BE ANOTHER

38:08.327 --> 38:10.872
ONE OF THOSE STORIES

38:10.914 --> 38:12.331
LIKE THE BUNNY STORY?

38:12.373 --> 38:13.792
HIS NAME WAS MURRAY, MOM.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.128
OH, EMILY, YOU HAD

38:13.833 --> 38:16.128
TO BRING THAT UP.

38:16.169 --> 38:19.464
HOW COULD YOU THINK I WOULDN'T

38:16.169 --> 38:19.464
NOTICE YOU GAVE AWAY MY RABBIT?

38:19.505 --> 38:21.883
BECAUSE YOU WERE 4 AND

38:19.505 --> 38:21.883
TERRIFIED OF THE THING.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.261
I WAS NOT TERRIFIED.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.261
I SIMPLY RESPECTED HIS SPACE.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.554
YOU SLEPT IN THE MAID'S ROOM

38:24.302 --> 38:26.554
FOR A WEEK.

38:26.596 --> 38:28.181
I WONDER WHERE

38:26.596 --> 38:28.181
MURRAY IS NOW.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.515
IN A SHOEBOX SOMEWHERE,

38:28.223 --> 38:29.515
I ASSUME.

38:29.557 --> 38:30.475
GRANDPA.

38:30.516 --> 38:32.144
VERY NICE.

38:30.516 --> 38:32.144
AND ON MY BIRTHDAY.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.688
ONCE AGAIN, A TOAST TO LORELAI

38:32.185 --> 38:35.688
ON HER 36th BIRTHDAY.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.398
35th.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.151
REALLY?

38:39.192 --> 38:40.944
YOU'RE DOING THE MATH?

38:40.986 --> 38:44.322
SORRY. TO LORELAI ON HER

38:40.986 --> 38:44.322
35th BIRTHDAY.

38:44.363 --> 38:45.949
HEAR, HEAR.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.493
THANK YOU FOR THE TOAST.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.493
THANK YOU FOR THE DINNER.

38:48.534 --> 38:50.369
AND IN THE SPIRIT OF

38:48.534 --> 38:50.369
THE EVENING,

38:50.411 --> 38:52.872
MOM, I HAVE

38:50.411 --> 38:52.872
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

38:52.914 --> 38:54.749
FOR ME?

38:52.914 --> 38:54.749
IT'S NOT MY BIRTHDAY.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.084
I KNOW, BUT HERE.

38:56.126 --> 38:58.295
IT'S FROM MURRAY.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.379
IT'S TAKEN HIM THIS LONG

38:58.336 --> 39:00.379
TO WRITE IT,

39:00.421 --> 39:03.175
'CAUSE OF THE HURT AND PAIN

39:00.421 --> 39:03.175
AND 'CAUSE HE HAS PAWS.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.468
WHAT IS THIS?

39:03.216 --> 39:05.468
THAT IS WHAT I OWE YOU.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.386
WHAT YOU OWE ME?

39:05.510 --> 39:07.386
FOR RORY'S SCHOOL.

39:07.428 --> 39:10.765
I PROMISED YOU I'D PAY YOU BACK,

39:07.428 --> 39:10.765
AND NOW I HAVE, EVERY CENT.

39:10.807 --> 39:13.810
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR

39:10.807 --> 39:13.810
HELPING US OUT.

39:13.852 --> 39:18.023
THERE'S NO WAY RORY WOULD BE

39:13.852 --> 39:18.023
GOING TO YALE

39:13.852 --> 39:18.023
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.398
YOU'RE WELCOME.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.733
OKAY, SO --

39:20.775 --> 39:22.777
YOU MUST BE VERY RELIEVED.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.904
YOUR DEBT IS PAID.

39:22.819 --> 39:24.904
YOU OWE US NOTHING.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.405
YOU DON'T NEED US ANYMORE.

39:26.447 --> 39:28.241
UM, I DIDN'T SAY --

39:28.283 --> 39:30.035
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL

39:28.283 --> 39:30.035
WITH US.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.829
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME OVER

39:30.076 --> 39:32.829
FOR FRIDAY-NIGHT DINNERS.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.623
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THAT.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.623
OH, NO?

39:35.665 --> 39:38.210
NO, I OWED YOU MONEY,

39:35.665 --> 39:38.210
AND I PAID YOU BACK.

39:38.251 --> 39:41.004
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MAD

39:38.251 --> 39:41.004
THAT I'M PAYING YOU BACK.

39:41.046 --> 39:44.341
I JUST THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

39:41.046 --> 39:44.341
UNKIND OF YOU

39:44.382 --> 39:46.134
TO USE THIS OCCASION

39:44.382 --> 39:46.134
TO INFORM ME

39:46.176 --> 39:47.719
YOU WON'T BE COMING

39:46.176 --> 39:47.719
OVER ANYMORE.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.512
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.512
THIS SAID THAT.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.223
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING --

39:51.264 --> 39:54.059
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER WE CAME OVER

39:51.264 --> 39:54.059
HERE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO,

39:54.100 --> 39:56.602
NOT BECAUSE OF SOME THREAT

39:54.100 --> 39:56.602
YOU'RE HOLDING OVER OUR HEADS?

39:56.644 --> 39:58.521
OH, AND YOU WOULD COME

39:56.644 --> 39:58.521
HERE VOLUNTARILY?

39:58.563 --> 40:01.858
I ALWAYS SAID I WOULD

39:58.563 --> 40:01.858
PAY YOU BACK.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.858
THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.193
IT CERTAINLY ISN'T.

40:03.235 --> 40:05.653
I WAS TRYING TO DO

40:03.235 --> 40:05.653
A GOOD THING HERE.

40:05.695 --> 40:08.614
WHEN DAD GAVE ME THE MONEY,

40:05.695 --> 40:08.614
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS --

40:08.656 --> 40:11.743
WHEN DAD GAVE YOU THE MONEY?

40:08.656 --> 40:11.743
WHEN DAD GAVE HER THE MONEY?

40:11.784 --> 40:13.328
YOU GAVE HER THIS?

40:13.370 --> 40:14.579
IT WAS HER MONEY.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.206
IT WAS FROM THAT

40:14.620 --> 40:16.206
INVESTMENT, MOM.

40:16.248 --> 40:18.583
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D

40:16.248 --> 40:18.583
STAY OUT OF THIS.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.752
I TOLD YOU NOT TO TELL YOUR

40:18.624 --> 40:20.752
MOTHER ABOUT THAT MONEY.

40:20.793 --> 40:21.920
WHEN DID YOU TELL ME THAT?

40:21.961 --> 40:23.421
AT LUNCH.

40:23.462 --> 40:26.216
DAD, I SWEAR YOU DIDN'T TELL

40:23.462 --> 40:26.216
ME NOT TO TELL MOM.

40:26.258 --> 40:29.928
WHY DO YOU THINK

40:26.258 --> 40:29.928
I MET YOU IN THE DAY

40:26.258 --> 40:29.928
AT A RESTAURANT, LORELAI?

40:29.969 --> 40:31.971
YOU KEPT THIS FROM ME,

40:29.969 --> 40:31.971
RICHARD?

40:32.013 --> 40:33.598
I KNEW YOU WOULD BE UPSET.

40:33.639 --> 40:36.475
I HAD TO GIVE IT TO HER.

40:33.639 --> 40:36.475
I WAS LEGALLY OBLIGATED.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.436
YOU'RE ALSO LEGALLY OBLIGATED

40:36.517 --> 40:38.436
TO YOUR WIFE.

40:38.477 --> 40:40.230
MOM.

40:38.477 --> 40:40.230
DON'T YOU TALK TO ME.

40:40.272 --> 40:41.856
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

40:41.898 --> 40:44.650
DON'T YOU TALK TO ME EITHER.

40:41.898 --> 40:44.650
DON'T BE MAD AT DAD.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.361
STAY OUT OF THIS.

40:46.403 --> 40:48.405
PLEASE, JUST BECAUSE I

40:46.403 --> 40:48.405
GAVE YOU THIS MONEY

40:48.446 --> 40:50.782
DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NEVER GONNA

40:48.446 --> 40:50.782
COME OVER HERE AGAIN.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.951
WE WILL COME OVER.

40:52.992 --> 40:56.495
MAYBE NOT EVERY WEEK,

40:52.992 --> 40:56.495
BUT THERE WILL BE THE

40:52.992 --> 40:56.495
OCCASIONAL FRIDAY-NIGHT DINNERS.

40:56.537 --> 40:57.914
NO, THERE WON'T.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.082
GRANDMA.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.499
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY

40:59.124 --> 41:00.499
DOING ME ANY FAVORS.

41:00.541 --> 41:03.044
YOU ARE RELEASED FROM YOUR

41:00.541 --> 41:03.044
OBLIGATION, LORELAI.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.130
HAVE A NICE BIRTHDAY.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.130
HAVE A NICE LIFE.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.173
I'M GOING TO BED.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.134
DAD...

41:07.215 --> 41:09.134
NOT NOW.

41:22.397 --> 41:25.066
YOU'RE QUIET.

41:25.108 --> 41:28.611
I KNOW THEY WERE UPSET, HON, BUT

41:25.108 --> 41:28.611
TRUST ME, THEY'LL CALM DOWN.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.113
WHY DID YOU DO THAT,

41:30.155 --> 41:32.531
JUST GIVING THEM THAT CHECK

41:30.155 --> 41:32.531
LIKE THAT?

41:32.573 --> 41:34.117
RORY, I BORROWED

41:32.573 --> 41:34.117
THAT MONEY.

41:34.159 --> 41:37.036
BUT YOU HAD TO HAVE KNOWN THAT

41:34.159 --> 41:37.036
THEY'D GET UPSET.

41:37.078 --> 41:39.580
YOU HAD TO KNOW THAT GRANDMA

41:37.078 --> 41:39.580
WOULD TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

41:39.622 --> 41:42.125
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO --

41:39.622 --> 41:42.125
NOT PAY THEM BACK?

41:42.167 --> 41:44.961
MAYBE. THEY DIDN'T WANT

41:42.167 --> 41:44.961
THE MONEY BACK.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.338
RORY, IT'S NOT THE POINT.

41:46.379 --> 41:48.173
THEY WERE THROWING YOU

41:46.379 --> 41:48.173
A PARTY, MOM.

41:48.214 --> 41:51.259
DID I DANCE AROUND SAYING,

41:48.214 --> 41:51.259
"NA-NA-NA-NA-NA"

41:51.301 --> 41:52.844
WHEN I GAVE HER THE CHECK?

41:52.885 --> 41:55.472
DID I NOT GENUINELY THANK HER

41:52.885 --> 41:55.472
FOR EVERYTHING?

41:55.513 --> 41:57.640
DID I NOT CREDIT YOUR

41:55.513 --> 41:57.640
GETTING INTO YALE

41:57.682 --> 41:59.225
WITH THEM GIVING US

41:57.682 --> 41:59.225
THAT MONEY?

41:59.267 --> 42:01.644
YES, BUT --

41:59.267 --> 42:01.644
NO BUTS.

42:01.686 --> 42:04.981
YOU'RE NOT AWARE

42:01.686 --> 42:04.981
OF HOW HARD IT'S FOR ME

42:01.686 --> 42:04.981
THESE PAST THREE YEARS

42:05.023 --> 42:06.691
TO BE INDEBTED TO MY PARENTS.

42:06.732 --> 42:08.234
I DECIDED A LONG TIME AGO

42:08.276 --> 42:10.778
THAT I WAS GONNA LIVE MY LIFE

42:08.276 --> 42:10.778
WITHOUT THEIR HELP.

42:10.820 --> 42:14.407
I WENT TO THEM AND TOOK THEIR

42:10.820 --> 42:14.407
MONEY, AND I'M NOT SORRY I DID.

42:14.449 --> 42:16.617
BUT I DON'T NEED THEIR

42:14.449 --> 42:16.617
HELP ANYMORE.

42:16.659 --> 42:19.787
FINE, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST

42:16.659 --> 42:19.787
THROW IT IN THEIR FACES.

42:19.829 --> 42:22.290
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PAY

42:19.829 --> 42:22.290
BACK A LOAN.

42:22.332 --> 42:25.126
I HAVE POLONIUS AND THE ENTIRE

42:22.332 --> 42:25.126
BANKING SYSTEM ON MY SIDE.

42:25.168 --> 42:27.420
I JUST THINK YOU COULD HAVE

42:25.168 --> 42:27.420
DONE IT DIFFERENTLY.

42:27.462 --> 42:28.713
HOW?

42:27.462 --> 42:28.713
I DON'T KNOW.

42:28.754 --> 42:30.423
TAKE A SHOT.

42:28.754 --> 42:30.423
I DON'T KNOW.

42:30.465 --> 42:32.467
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY

42:30.465 --> 42:32.467
PARENTS IS VERY DIFFERENT

42:32.509 --> 42:34.093
FROM YOUR RELATIONSHIP

42:32.509 --> 42:34.093
WITH THEM.

42:34.135 --> 42:36.637
YOU ONLY KNOW THE WARM AND

42:34.135 --> 42:36.637
FUZZY RICHARD AND EMILY,

42:36.679 --> 42:39.807
BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUR

42:36.679 --> 42:39.807
GRANDPARENTS AND THEY LOVE YOU,

42:39.849 --> 42:41.934
BUT I HAVE A DIFFERENT

42:39.849 --> 42:41.934
HISTORY WITH THEM,

42:41.976 --> 42:45.063
AND IT WAS NOT ALL WARM, AND

42:41.976 --> 42:45.063
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT ALL FUZZY.

42:45.104 --> 42:48.358
SO DO NOT JUDGE ME

42:45.104 --> 42:48.358
FOR REPAYING A LOAN

42:48.400 --> 42:50.402
THAT I ALWAYS INTENDED

42:48.400 --> 42:50.402
TO REPAY,

42:50.443 --> 42:52.945
THAT I TOLD THEM FROM

42:50.443 --> 42:52.945
THE BEGINNING I WOULD REPAY,

42:52.987 --> 42:54.822
THAT I HAD TO REPAY.

42:54.864 --> 42:57.909
I WILL NOT LET THEM MAKE ME FEEL

42:54.864 --> 42:57.909
GUILTY FOR DOING THAT,

42:57.950 --> 43:00.745
AND I WILL NOT LET YOU MAKE ME

42:57.950 --> 43:00.745
FEEL GUILTY EITHER.

43:00.786 --> 43:02.872
I'M SORRY.

43:00.786 --> 43:02.872
THAT'S OKAY.

43:08.378 --> 43:09.795
[ GASPS ]

43:09.837 --> 43:11.130
GOOD, GOOD.

43:11.172 --> 43:12.424
OKAY, LEFT.

43:12.465 --> 43:14.884
OH, MY GOD.

43:12.465 --> 43:14.884
WHAT IS THAT?

43:14.926 --> 43:18.096
THE WORLD'S LARGEST

43:14.926 --> 43:18.096
PIZZA...ALMOST.

43:18.137 --> 43:21.849
THAT IS AMAZING.

43:21.891 --> 43:24.060
YOU LIKE IT?

43:24.102 --> 43:26.104
I LOVE IT.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.730
THANK YOU, HONEY.

43:33.152 --> 43:35.154
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED

43:33.152 --> 43:35.154
TO KIRK?
