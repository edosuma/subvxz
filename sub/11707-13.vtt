{\an8}HARD ENOUGH
TO BRING GIRLS BACK

03:39.135 --> 03:40.720

THE LANGUAGE BARRIER,

03:40.803 --> 03:42.138
{\an8}THE AGE AND [bleep],

03:42.221 --> 03:43.723
{\an8}BUT I CAN'T EVEN GET A HOOKER

03:43.806 --> 03:44.641
{\an8}TO COME BACK

03:55.360 --> 03:56.110

03:56.194 --> 03:58.154
DOES YOUR GAME
NOT WORK IN ITALY?

03:58.237 --> 04:00.990
- WHO'S SHE TALKING TO?
[laughs]

04:01.074 --> 04:03.743
- I THINK, LIKE, WE GOT
REALLY SPOILED IN SEASIDE.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.161
THE GIRLS CAME HOME
A LOT EASIER.

04:05.244 --> 04:07.664

04:22.428 --> 04:25.181

SOMETHING IN THAT WINE,

04:25.264 --> 04:27.100
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO COOK,
RIGHT?

04:27.183 --> 04:28.101
- ACTUALLY, THE GIRLS,
YEAH, WE COOKED A LOT.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.436
- WE COOKED EVERY WEEKEND
AFTER THAT.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.522
- GUYS, WHAT'S THE VERDICT?
HOW WAS THEIR COOKING?

04:32.605 --> 04:34.565
- WE LOST A LOT
OF WEIGHT IN ITALY.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.859
- NO, DEENA'S CHICKEN
WAS AWESOME.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.696
- THERE WAS NOT LEFTOVER LEFT
OF MY BALSAMIC CHICKEN, SO--

04:39.779 --> 04:40.279
- SHE ATE IT ALL.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.282
SHE ATE EVERY BIT OF IT.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.159
SHE HAD IT FOR BREAKFAST,
LUNCH, AND DINNER ALL WEEK.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.286
- GET REAL.
- ALL THE GIRLS ATE IT.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.870
PAULY, GET REAL.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.205
- AND HOW WAS THEIR CLEANING?

04:49.288 --> 04:50.373
- JUST LIKE THEIR COOKING.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.708
- I SCRUBBED TABLES.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.042
I NEVER DO THAT.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.460
- ONE DAY YOU GUYS
WERE VERY PLEASED--

04:54.544 --> 04:56.379
- WE WERE THERE FOR TWO MONTHS.
YOU CLEANED FOR ONE DAY.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.047
- HOW ABOUT I WOULD GO
IN THE BATHROOM,

04:58.131 --> 04:59.132
THERE'S POOP ON THE TOILET?

04:59.215 --> 05:01.050
- AAH!
- WHO WANTS TO [...] TOUCH THAT?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.385
WASN'T EVEN MINE.
- IT WAS YOUR POOP!

05:02.468 --> 05:05.805
- IT WAS NOT MY POOP,
AND I CLEANED THAT [bleep].

05:05.888 --> 05:06.764
LITERALLY.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.307
- LITERALLY!

05:08.391 --> 05:09.767
- MIKE, OR SHOULD I SAY

05:09.851 --> 05:11.728
"CROUCHING TIGER
HIDDEN SITUATION"?

05:11.811 --> 05:14.147
YOU REALLY SHOWED
THAT GARBAGE CAN, DIDN'T YOU?

05:14.230 --> 05:15.732
- OH, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.567
UM, I WAS JUST ALWAYS
ON THE DEFENSE.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.652
AND, EVEN THOUGH, LIKE, UH,

YOU AGAINST THE WALL.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.658
- IT WAS ME AGAINST, LIKE,
THE GARBAGE CAN.

05:25.742 --> 05:26.826
IT WAS ME AGAINST ANYTHING.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.911
UNTIL I--LATER I MADE
AMENDS WITH THE WALL.

05:28.995 --> 05:29.871
I--YOU KNOW?

05:29.954 --> 05:32.915
- IT BROUGHT THE KARATE KID
OUT IN HIM.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.625
- AFTER THE FIGHT
WITH ME AND RONNIE,

05:34.709 --> 05:36.252
I WAS JUST GETTING INTO A LOT
OF ARGUMENTS AND FIGHTS, AND--

05:36.335 --> 05:38.463
- WELL, YOU TALKED
A LOT OF [bleep],

05:38.546 --> 05:39.672
SAYING THAT YOU'RE GONNA
[bleep] KILL SOMEBODY,

05:39.756 --> 05:41.758
AND THEN YOU'RE SITTING
IN THE CORNER LIKE A [bleep].

05:41.841 --> 05:44.886
- WHEN WAS THAT?

05:44.969 --> 05:47.638
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
- AND IT BEGINS.

05:47.722 --> 05:48.598
- WHOA.
WHEN WAS THIS?

05:48.681 --> 05:49.766
- YOU NEVER BEEN
IN A REAL FIGHT.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.685
YOU WERE SCARED TO GET
KNOCKED OUT BY RON, BECAUSE--

05:52.769 --> 05:55.271
- DAMN.
- REALLY?

05:55.354 --> 05:56.439
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST LOOK STRAIGHT.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.440
JUST LOOK STRAIGHT.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.900
- NO, YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

05:58.983 --> 05:59.984
- I'M SORRY. I'M NOT GONNA
TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.611
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO.
I'VE SEEN YOU DO IT.

06:01.694 --> 06:05.364
- OH!

06:05.448 --> 06:06.616
- YOU'RE SO DISGUSTING.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.867
- IF I'M DISGUSTING,

06:07.950 --> 06:09.577
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SEEN
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

06:09.660 --> 06:10.787
- OKAY, OKAY, MIKE.

06:10.870 --> 06:11.662
GET OVER IT,
YOUR [bleep] STORY.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.748
NOBODY CARES ANYMORE.
GET OVER IT.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.249
- YOU'RE TALKING MAD TRASH
RIGHT NOW,

06:15.333 --> 06:16.584
YOU KNOW,
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

06:16.667 --> 06:17.627
- YOU KNOW WHY?

06:17.710 --> 06:19.212
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A [bleep] BAD FRIEND.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.047
I HAVE HAD
SO MANY GOOD FRIENDS--

06:21.130 --> 06:22.965
- WE DIDN'T EVEN
GET TO THAT PART YET.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.258
[laughter]
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

06:24.342 --> 06:26.385
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

06:26.469 --> 06:27.637
- WE DIDN'T GET
TO THAT PART YET.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.638
- I'M, LIKE, REALLY IRRITATED
AT THE FACT

06:28.721 --> 06:31.015
THAT YOU'RE, LIKE,
2 INCHES AWAY FROM ME.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.767
LIKE, GET AWAY.
- WELL, YOU WEREN'T IRRITATED

06:32.850 --> 06:34.519
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE CLOSER
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.311
- OKAY, MIKE, GOOD JOB.
KEEP SAYING IT.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.230
BUT WE'RE ALL OVER IT,
SO STOP.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.481
MAKE UP ANOTHER STORY.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.316
- I DID GET OVER IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:40.399 --> 06:42.318
- OKAY.
[laughter]

06:42.401 --> 06:43.319
WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK,

06:43.402 --> 06:44.278
BUT WHEN WE COME BACK,

06:44.362 --> 06:45.655
BE PREPARED
TO BE STALKED BY TWINS.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.491
WE'LL ALSO FIND OUT
WHY EVERYBODY IS SO ANGRY.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.575
SO DON'T GO ANYWHERE,

ME EVERY FIVE SECONDS?

07:34.495 --> 07:35.371
- OH, SORRY.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.290
- DO YOU KNOW,
BACK IN KINDERGARTEN,

07:37.373 --> 07:39.041
WHEN A GIRL LIKES A GUY,
SHE ACTUALLY, LIKE, HITS HIM

07:39.125 --> 07:40.334
AND, LIKE, YELLS AT HIM
AND ARGUES,

07:40.418 --> 07:42.545
AND ONLY BECAUSE SHE, LIKE,
HAS A CRUSH ON HIM.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.213
- I NEVER PICKED ON YOU
UNTIL YOU WERE A DOUCHEBAG

07:44.297 --> 07:46.549
AND YOU SHOWED
US YOUR COLORS.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.301
- PICKED ON ME?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN PICKED ON ME?

07:48.384 --> 07:49.594
- OH, YEAH,
WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS,

07:49.677 --> 07:50.928
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
"OH, MY GOD,

07:51.012 --> 07:52.013
"I HAVE FEELINGS FOR SNOOKI.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.181
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.724
"RON, LIKE,
HOW DO I DEAL WITH THIS?

07:54.807 --> 07:56.601
"OH, YEAH, SHE GAVE ME [bleep].
SHE [bleep] ME."

07:56.684 --> 07:58.477
- THAT'S TRUE. THAT IS TRUE.
THAT PART'S TRUE.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.562
- GET [bleep] REAL.
- THAT PART'S TRUE.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.648
- OKAY, MIKE.
OKAY, MIKE.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.233
HONESTLY, I LOVE
EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE,

08:04.317 --> 08:06.694
AND NOBODY HAS EVER
DONE ME LIKE YOU DID.

08:06.777 --> 08:07.570
- I--THAT'S TRUE.
I NEVER--

08:07.653 --> 08:11.365
EVERYBODY AIN'T DONE YOU
LIKE I HAVE.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.035
- YOU'RE SO GONNA BE
THAT [bleep] JERK

08:14.118 --> 08:15.703
THAT'S GONNA BE LIKE THAT?
GET OVER IT.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.079
- NO, STOP TALKING TRASH.
- GET OVER IT.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.206
- LISTEN, YOU GET OVER IT.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.290
- YOU GUYS WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT? WE'LL GO THERE.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.417
MIKE, IT WASN'T
ALL FUN AND GAMES

08:21.500 --> 08:23.169
WITH YOU AND YOUR ROOMMATES
THIS SUMMER,

08:23.252 --> 08:24.712
PARTICULARLY WITH SNOOKI,
AS WE CAN SEE.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.048
- SO [bleep] WEIRD.
LET'S GO.

08:27.131 --> 08:30.009
{\an8}- ME AND SNOOKI,
WE KIND OF HOOKED UP.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.260
{\an8}THIS IS, LIKE,
PRETTY SERIOUS.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.678
{\an8}- EVEN AS MIKE'S SITTING HERE

08:32.761 --> 08:34.429
{\an8}TELLING ME THAT HE
HOOKED UP WITH SNOOKI,

08:34.514 --> 08:35.556
{\an8}I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.724
{\an8}LIKE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

08:36.807 --> 08:38.392
{\an8}I JUST FEEL LIKE HE'S TRYING
TO CAUSE TROUBLE

08:38.476 --> 08:39.434
{\an8}LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.313
- AND YOU CAN'T TELL IT
TO ANYBODY.

08:42.395 --> 08:44.774
- MIKE TOLD PEOPLE
ABOUT WHAT YOU GUYS DID.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.443
EVERYONE.
- WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.195
- I'M NOT SURE IF MIKE
AND NICOLE HOOKED UP,

08:49.278 --> 08:51.572
BECAUSE THERE IS THREE SIDES
TO EVERY STORY--

08:51.656 --> 08:54.033
{\an8}MIKE'S SIDE, NICOLE'S SIDE,
AND THE TRUTH.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.952
{\an8}- [bleep] MIKE.

08:56.035 --> 08:56.619
{\an8}- WHAT?

08:56.702 --> 08:58.162
{\an8}- YOU'RE TELLING EVERYBODY

08:58.246 --> 08:59.372
{\an8}THAT I CHEATED
ON JIONNI WITH YOU.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.915
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN SAY THAT?

09:00.998 --> 09:02.667
- NO, NO, I DIDN'T TELL
EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.461
- OKAY, WELL, OBVIOUSLY
YOU'RE LYING RIGHT NOW,

09:05.544 --> 09:07.505
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW [bleep]
MUCH I LOVE JIONNI.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.257
I AM NOT [bleep]
DEALING WITH THAT [bleep].

09:09.340 --> 09:10.383
THAT'S [bleep] UP.

09:10.466 --> 09:13.552
I THOUGHT MIKE CAME
INTO THIS HOUSE BEING DIFFERENT,

09:13.636 --> 09:14.971
BUT MIKE
IS BEING THE WORST MIKE

09:15.054 --> 09:17.139
I'VE EVER SEEN
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.350
- IF YOU REALLY LOVED
YOUR BOYFRIEND THAT MUCH,

09:19.433 --> 09:21.560
{\an8}YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
[bleep] WITH ME.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.980
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE MAYBE
SOMETHING DID HAPPEN

09:24.063 --> 09:25.147
{\an8}WITH NICOLE AND MIKE.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.400
{\an8}IN MY GUT, I FEEL LIKE
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.651
{\an8}- I CALL MY BOY UNIT,
LIKE, TWO HOURS AGO.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.904
{\an8}I'M LIKE, "DOG, THEY'RE MAKING
ME LOOK OUT TO BE A LIAR."

09:31.988 --> 09:33.572
HE'S LIKE, "YEAH,
I'LL CALL JIONNI RIGHT NOW.

09:33.656 --> 09:34.949
WHAT'S HIS NUMBER?"

09:35.032 --> 09:37.159
{\an8}I GOT JIONNI'S NUMBER OUT
THE PHONE BOOK AND GAVE IT.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.829
{\an8}BUT IN REALITY,
ALL I DID IS CALL UNIT

09:39.912 --> 09:41.831
{\an8}AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE STORY
TOGETHER AND LAUGHED ABOUT IT.

09:41.914 --> 09:45.293
{\an8}- I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT
THE [bleep] JUST HAPPENED.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.669
{\an8}MIKE CALLED THE UNIT
TO CALL JIONNI

09:46.752 --> 09:48.254
AND TELL HIM EVERYTHING
THAT [bleep] HAPPENED

09:48.337 --> 09:49.797
WITH YOU AND MIKE.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.801
- STOP GETTING IN MY BUSINESS,
YOU MOTHER[bleep].

09:53.884 --> 09:56.304
{\an8}STOP [bleep] GETTING
IN MY BUSINESS, YOU [bleep].

09:56.387 --> 09:59.307
{\an8}MIKE, I'M NOT KIDDING.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.018
{\an8}[bleep] YOU.
[bleep] YOU.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.312
{\an8}I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING
RIGHT NOW.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.896
BECAUSE, HONESTLY,

10:05.980 --> 10:08.232
I SEE WHAT ALL MY ROOMMATES
SAY BEHIND MY BACK.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.483
SO THAT'S NICE TO KNOW.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.443
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.861
EVEN YOU, JENNI.
THANK YOU.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.196
I KNOW WHAT THE [bleep]
HAPPENS, AND I KNOW--

10:14.280 --> 10:15.531
- I DIDN'T SAY [bleep].

10:15.615 --> 10:17.366
- NO, DEENA, NOT YOU,
BUT EVERYBODY ELSE,

10:17.450 --> 10:19.160
[bleep] ALL YOU GUYS.
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

10:19.243 --> 10:20.244
- WHAT DID I SAY?
THREE SIDES TO EVERY STORY.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.413
- "OH, MIKE HAS HER STORY,
NICOLE HAS HER STORY"?

10:22.496 --> 10:24.498
THAT'S NOT A BEST A FRIEND.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.460
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
FIRST OF ALL--FIRST OF ALL--

10:27.543 --> 10:29.128
- I'M THE ONE THAT
WENT UP TO YOU AND TOLD YOU

10:29.211 --> 10:30.296
THAT HE WAS RUNNING HIS MOUTH.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.131
I'M THE ONE THAT
CALLED HIM OUT ON IT.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.967
I'M THE ONE THAT CHASED DOWN
JIONNI THAT NIGHT.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.719
I'M THE ONE THAT [bleep]
WENT THERE

10:36.802 --> 10:38.721
TILL 8:00
IN THE [bleep] MORNING

10:38.804 --> 10:40.473
TO GET YOUR [bleep]
BOYFRIEND BACK.

10:40.556 --> 10:41.390
- THEN WHY'D YOU HAVE
TO SAY THAT?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.060
SAMMI'D NEVER SAY THAT
ABOUT DEENA,

10:44.143 --> 10:45.186
SO WHY THE [bleep] WOULD YOU
SAY THAT ABOUT ME?

10:45.269 --> 10:48.314
"OH, I DON'T BELIEVE MIKE,
I DON'T BELIEVE NICOLE.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.857
WHATEVER COMES OUT,
COMES OUT."

10:49.940 --> 10:52.610
I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT
ABOUT YOU, AND THAT'S IT.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.612
DO YOU SEE WHAT
[bleep] HAPPENS?

10:54.695 --> 10:56.238
YOU SEE YOUR [bleep]
BULL[bleep]?

10:56.322 --> 10:56.947
YOU [bleep] MESS WITH ME
AND MY BEST FRIEND'S FIGHT.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.991
[bleep] YOU.

10:59.075 --> 10:59.658
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIT ANYBODY.
CHILL.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.410
- GUYS, WHO BELIEVES MIKE?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.037
- I SW--I--I DON'T LIE.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.997
- [bleep] THIS.

11:05.081 --> 11:05.998
YOU GUYS ARE [bleep] FAKE,

11:06.082 --> 11:07.583
AND I [bleep] HATE YOU GUYS.

11:07.666 --> 11:09.210
- SNOOKI,
IF YOU KNEW YOU WERE RIGHT,

11:09.293 --> 11:11.337
THEN YOU WOULD JUST BE
CHILLIN' RIGHT NOW, LIKE--

11:11.420 --> 11:13.506
YOU COME HERE
ATTACKING EVERYBODY.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.841
IT'S ALL REFLECTING
ON YOURSELF.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.927
- DO ANY OF YOU THINK
SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH?

11:18.010 --> 11:19.011
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:19.095 --> 11:20.888
SHE KEPT THE SAME STORY WITH ME
AS SHE TOLD ME

11:20.971 --> 11:23.432
MONTHS BEFORE
WE WENT INTO THAT HOUSE.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.892
- AT THE END OF THE DAY,

11:24.975 --> 11:26.519
REGARDLESS OF HOW SHE FEELS
ABOUT ME RIGHT NOW,

11:26.602 --> 11:28.604
MY BEST FRIEND,
SHE IS TELLING THE TRUTH,

11:28.687 --> 11:29.897
THE SAME TRUTH SHE TOLD ME
THAT NIGHT IN DECEMBER.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.109
- SHE MIGHT HAVE--YEAH, SHE
MIGHT HAVE CHANGED THE STORY--

11:33.192 --> 11:34.443
- SO NO MATTER HOW ANGRY
I AM RIGHT NOW

11:34.527 --> 11:35.611
AND WANT TO TALK [bleep],
I WON'T,

11:35.694 --> 11:37.405
BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT THAT'S HER,

11:37.488 --> 11:38.781
AND TO ME IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.741
SHE [bleep]ED VINNY
SIX MONTHS LATER.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.284
JIONNI FORGAVE HER.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.327
SO WHAT THE [bleep]
IS THE BIG DEAL

11:43.411 --> 11:46.455
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED
SIX MONTHS PRIOR

11:46.539 --> 11:47.665
THAT NEVER EVEN HAPPENED?

11:47.748 --> 11:50.167
- EVEN IF I WANTED TO HOOK UP
WITH ANYBODY IN THE HOUSE,

11:50.251 --> 11:51.460
IT'D PROBABLY BE PAULY.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.002
- OKAY. NOW WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.213
IF IT WENT--

11:54.296 --> 11:56.298
DIDN'T WE ALREADY HOOK UP
A NUMBER OF TIMES?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.884
- MIKE, WE HOOKED UP
THE FIRST SEASON, EVERYBODY SAW,

11:58.968 --> 12:00.553
AND THEN, LIKE,
TWO MONTHS AFTER IN L.A.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.221
- OKAY, AND THEN WE HOOKED UP
IN L.A. AGAIN...

12:02.304 --> 12:03.347
- AND THAT'S IT!
- AND THEN WE HOOKED UP AGAIN

12:03.431 --> 12:05.683
AT SOME AWARD SHOW,
WHICH WAS RIGHT BEFORE ITALY.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.143
- OKAY, MIKE, YOU KEEP GOING
WITH YOUR STORY,

12:07.226 --> 12:09.145
'CAUSE I'M OVER IT--

12:09.228 --> 12:09.812
- MY STORY HAS NEVER CHANGED.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.689
YOURS CHANGES ALL THE TIME.

12:11.772 --> 12:12.982
- OKAY, RONNIE,
WHEN MIKE TOLD YOU

12:13.065 --> 12:14.108
ABOUT HOOKING UP WITH SNOOKI,

12:14.191 --> 12:16.026
DID YOU RAT HIM OUT
BY TELLING OTHER PEOPLE?

12:16.110 --> 12:17.278
- WITH MIKE AT THAT POINT,

12:17.361 --> 12:18.779
IT WAS, LIKE, THERE WAS
NO GUY CODE WITH ME AND HIM,

12:18.863 --> 12:19.864
BUT HE'S BEEN RATTING ME OUT

12:19.947 --> 12:21.198
FOR [bleep] FOUR HOUSES
ALREADY.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.867
HOW DOES MY ONE THING
COMPARE TO HIS NINE?

12:22.950 --> 12:25.119
- THAT BEING SAID,
WHO DO YOU BELIEVE NOW?

12:25.202 --> 12:26.704
- RIGHT NOW,
IT'S, LIKE--

12:26.787 --> 12:28.330
IT'S A TOSS UP.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.000
- SO, SNOOKI, WHAT DID YOU
THINK OF HIS INTENTIONS

12:31.083 --> 12:31.584
WHEN HE MADE UP THIS STORY
IN YOUR MIND?

12:31.667 --> 12:32.334
YOU SAY HE MADE IT UP.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.003
- IF HE HAD FEELINGS FOR ME,

12:34.086 --> 12:37.506
DON'T YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE
TOLD ME BEFORE ITALY?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.842
BUT HE WAITED FOR, LIKE, THREE
WEEKS TILL WE WERE IN ITALY,

12:39.925 --> 12:41.260
AND THEN HE'S LIKE,
"YO, RON."

12:41.343 --> 12:42.428
- BECAUSE I WAS
AROUND YOU A LOT.

12:42.511 --> 12:43.637
- IF YOU HAD FEELINGS FOR ME,

12:43.721 --> 12:45.723
WOULDN'T YOU TELL ME
INSTEAD OF RON?

12:45.806 --> 12:47.516
- I WANTED TO ASK
FOR A LITTLE BIT OF ADVICE.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.559
- WHO GIVES A [bleep]?

12:48.642 --> 12:49.435
- I DID SINCERELY
COME TO RONNIE,

12:49.518 --> 12:51.312
YOU KNOW, AND TALK TO HIM--

12:51.395 --> 12:52.938
BUT--BUT--
- [bleep]

12:53.022 --> 12:55.858
- YOU SINCERELY WENT TO RON?
THAT'S A CROCK OF [bleep].

12:55.941 --> 12:57.109
- YO, LET ME FINISH.
LET ME FINISH. GOD.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.029
- YOU HOOKING UP WITH NICOLE
AND HAD FEELINGS FOR NICOLE

13:00.112 --> 13:02.281
WAS SO OUT OF LEFT FIELD,
IT WAS RIDICULOUS.

13:02.364 --> 13:03.991
- RONNIE, YOU GOT TO--
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S GREAT, DUDE.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.159
SHE'S LIKE A PIT BULL.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.870
SHE DIDN'T LET ME
FINISH MY SENTENCE.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.413
- YOU COULD HAVE KEPT
YOUR MOUTH SHUT ABOUT IT

13:09.497 --> 13:10.498
IF YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HER.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.832
- WHY WOULD YOU
GO TO THE EXTREME

13:11.916 --> 13:13.042
TO HAVE YOUR BOY CALL JIONNI

13:13.125 --> 13:14.710
AND MAKE UP THAT LIE AS A JOKE?

13:14.793 --> 13:16.086
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

13:16.170 --> 13:16.921
- THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.714
MIKE,
WHY DID YOU TELL THE GIRLS

13:18.797 --> 13:19.715
THAT THE UNIT CALLED JIONNI?

13:19.798 --> 13:22.551
- UM, I ACTUALLY
WANTED TO PRETTY MUCH

13:22.635 --> 13:24.720
NOT ONLY GET THE TRUTH OUT THERE
ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED--

13:24.803 --> 13:27.181
- WHO COMES UP
WITH THAT TYPE OF [bleep]?

13:27.264 --> 13:28.641
- NO, JUST LET HIM TALK.
GO AHEAD, MIKE.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.894
- SO I CIRCULATED
A FAKE STORY,

13:31.977 --> 13:34.605
AND SURE ENOUGH
EVERYBODY WENT CRAZY,

13:34.688 --> 13:36.106
AND IT WASN'T EVEN TRUE.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.316
- WHAT'D I SAY TO YOU?

13:37.399 --> 13:38.984
- NO, I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.319
- I SAID,
"I'M TELLING NICOLE."

13:40.402 --> 13:42.613
- BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL NICOLE.
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.865
- I WAS STANDING WITH HER.
I TOLD NICOLE.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.116
- SOMEBODY ELSE TOLD NICOLE.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.826
- I WAS RIGHT THERE
IN THE ROOM AS WE WERE, LIKE--

13:47.910 --> 13:49.078
- I SAID,
"I AM TELLING NICOLE."

13:49.161 --> 13:50.246
- THAT'S, LIKE, MY FRIEND.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.455
WHY WOULDN'T
I [bleep] TELL MY FRIEND?

13:51.539 --> 13:52.790
- SNOOKI, WHAT DO YOU THINK

13:52.873 --> 13:54.667
ABOUT MIKE SAYING
THAT YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY GUILTY

13:54.750 --> 13:56.502

NOT GETTING THE GOLDEN TICKET.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.014
YOU'RE BOTH BEAUTIFUL.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.557
- DEENA, SHE JUST CAN'T
FIND THE GUY HERE IN ITALY,

15:33.641 --> 15:37.436
SO SHE'S TURNING TO CHICKS.

15:37.519 --> 15:38.228

{\an8}I WAS SUPPOSED

A ROBBERY BY DEENA.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.694

16:02.252 --> 16:04.046
{\an8}- YEP.
- THANK GOD.

16:04.129 --> 16:04.838
{\an8}I DEFINITELY THINK
YOU COULD GET PREGNANT

16:04.922 --> 16:08.050
{\an8}BY BEING [bleep]
POPPED BY A GIRL.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.052
{\an8}OKAY?
THAT CAN HAPPEN.

YOU WERE PREGNANT?

16:19.812 --> 16:20.896
GIVE ME THE SYMPTOMS
THAT YOU WERE GOING THROUGH.

16:20.979 --> 16:23.315
- I THOUGHT PAULY
USED PROTECTION.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.483
[laughter]

16:24.566 --> 16:25.901
- NO, I TOLD JENNI,
BECAUSE, LIKE,

16:25.984 --> 16:27.903
ME AND HER, WE WERE, LIKE,
TALKING ABOUT SOME STUFF.

16:27.986 --> 16:29.321
AND THEN I JUST
GOT FREAKED OUT.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.572
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.574
THEN AFTER I FOUND OUT I WASN'T,
I WAS, LIKE,

16:32.658 --> 16:36.078
"WHOO! LET'S TAKE
A FRICKIN' SHOT!"

16:36.161 --> 16:37.287
[cheers and applause]

16:37.371 --> 16:38.414

IN HER BACK POCKET.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.799
- THIS WAS, LIKE,
6:00 IN THE MORNING.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.426
WE WENT TO A PHARMACY,
IT WAS REALLY CREEPY.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.678
- IT WAS SO CREEPY.

16:52.761 --> 16:53.512
- IT WAS JUST--
IT HAD TO BE DONE

16:53.595 --> 16:54.805
BECAUSE SHE MIND[bleep]
HERSELF

16:54.888 --> 16:56.765
SO BAD THAT
SHE THOUGHT IT.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.268
- SHE KNOCKED HERSELF UP.
- YES.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.270
[laughter]

17:01.353 --> 17:03.147
- DEENA,
IF YOU WERE PREGNANT,

17:03.230 --> 17:06.150
WERE YOU HOPING BY SOME CRAZY
WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM

17:06.233 --> 17:07.651
THAT THE BABY WAS PAULY'S?

17:07.734 --> 17:09.111
- WHAT THE HELL?

17:13.240 --> 17:16.410
- SHE WAS THINKING SO FAR AHEAD
THAT I MADE HER, LIKE,

17:16.492 --> 17:17.368
THINK IN THAT MOMENT.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.288
- SHE ALREADY HAD
THE NURSERY PLANNED OUT

17:19.371 --> 17:21.623
IN THE HOUSE,
IT WAS CRAZY.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.624
- DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU FAILED

17:22.708 --> 17:24.292
IN YOUR SEARCH
FOR LOVE IN ITALY?

17:24.376 --> 17:25.627

17:25.711 --> 17:27.128
LIKE, THERE WAS GUYS THAT
I WOULD BRING HOME, LIKE,

17:27.212 --> 17:30.674

17:30.758 --> 17:32.384
LIKE, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
HAD A CREEPY TENDENCY.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.637

HAVE ANY GOOD MEN FOR YOU?

17:51.862 --> 17:53.739

SO I MIGHT AS WELL
TRY IT OUT.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.964
- HE'S LOUIE!

28:36.047 --> 28:36.339
I MEAN, YOU'RE TONY.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.883
[laughter]

28:38.967 --> 28:39.676
- YOU'RE LOUIE, I'M TONY!

28:39.759 --> 28:41.719
- ARE WE GOING
TO KARMA TONIGHT?

28:41.803 --> 28:43.346
- KARMA TONIGHT?
MY MOM'S DRIVING US!

28:43.430 --> 28:44.180
- SHE'S NOT DRIVING YOU.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.181
YOU DIDN'T CLEAN
YOUR [bleep] ROOM!

28:45.265 --> 28:46.224
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I DIDN'T CLEAN MY ROOM?

28:46.307 --> 28:48.309
I GOT MY ALLOWANCE, $5.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.395
- YOU GOT YOUR FIST PUMP?
- FIST PUMPS!

28:50.478 --> 28:51.396
FIST PUMP.

28:51.479 --> 28:53.314
PUSH-UP.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.149
CHAPSTICK.

28:54.232 --> 28:57.318
YES.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.989
- OH, WHAT UP, SON?
- WHAT UP, SON?

29:01.072 --> 29:02.532
[cheers and applause]

29:02.615 --> 29:04.826
- THAT'S SOME CHOREOGRAPHY.

29:04.909 --> 29:05.827
[laughs]

29:05.910 --> 29:08.079
- WE DO THAT EVERY TIME
WE SEE EACH OTHER,

29:08.163 --> 29:09.122
EVEN OFF THE SHOW.

29:09.205 --> 29:10.290
- YUP, AND WE EVEN,
LIKE, YO, ACT LIKE

29:10.373 --> 29:11.416
WE AIN'T SEEN
EACH OTHER IN A WHILE.

29:11.499 --> 29:12.834
- IT'S PRETTY ELABORATE.
- THINK SO?

29:12.917 --> 29:13.751
- YEAH, I DO.

29:13.835 --> 29:14.794
AND HOW DO
LOUIE AND TONY DANCE?

29:14.878 --> 29:17.088
- LIPS OUT, EYEBROWS UP,
FISTS ARE UP PUMPING.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.174
YOU CAN DO IT.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.967
THERE YOU GO.
- I FEEL ANGRY.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.635
ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE ANGRY?
- YEAH, BEAT THE BEAT UP.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.471
- BEAT IT UP.
- BEAT THAT BEAT UP.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.264
- ALL RIGHT.
[laughs]

29:26.347 --> 29:29.517
JWOWW, HOW IS PAULY'S CHARACTER
LIKE EVERY GUY YOU'VE DATED?

29:29.601 --> 29:33.229
- IT'S CLASSIC GUIDO
FROM BROOKLYN.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.356
- PAULY DOESN'T REALLY
HAVE TO BE MUCH TO PLAY A GUIDO.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.609
- HE SEEMS TO BE THERE.

29:37.692 --> 29:39.360
IT'S RIGHT UNDER THE SURFACE
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.987
[cheers and applause]

29:41.070 --> 29:42.322
- THANK YOU.

29:42.405 --> 29:45.992
- SO VINNY AND PAULY, WAS IT
TOUGH TO FIND A GIRL OVER 18?

29:46.075 --> 29:47.410
- SO MANY YOUNG GIRLS,
SO MANY YOUNG GIRLS.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.495
AND WE'D BE, LIKE,
"NO, SHE'S TOO YOUNG.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.787
"YO, SHE'S TOO YOUNG,
YOU CAN'T BRING HER BACK,

29:49.871 --> 29:50.788
SHE'S TOO YOUNG."

29:50.872 --> 29:52.123
- WE COULD ALMOST SEE IT.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.291
WE'RE, LIKE,
"ALL RIGHT, SHE'S TOO YOUNG.

29:53.374 --> 29:54.459
"YEAH, BUT SHE--
AW, NO, TOO YOUNG."

29:54.542 --> 29:55.668
- AND THEN WE JUST HAD
TO GET CREATIVE WITH IT.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.086
LIKE, THINK OF DIFFERENT WAYS
THAT YOU KNOW IF

29:57.170 --> 29:58.379
A GIRL'S
TOO YOUNG FOR YOU.

29:58.463 --> 29:59.547
- YO, IF SHE GOT SWEDISH FISH
STUCK IN HER BRACES,

29:59.631 --> 30:01.132
SHE'S TOO
YOUNG FOR YOU, BRO!

30:01.216 --> 30:03.551
- I KNOW, BRO.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.804
IF HER OLDER SISTER IS 13,
SHE'S TOO YOUNG FOR YOU, BRO.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.181
- WHAT ABOUT BEING TOO OLD?

30:08.264 --> 30:09.307
WHAT ARE YOUR RULES ABOUT
A GIRL BEING TOO OLD FOR YOU?

30:09.390 --> 30:11.226
- AW, NO, THEY CAN BE
[bleep] AS OLD AS THEY WANT.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.602
- IF SHE GETS THE SENIOR
CITIZENS' DISCOUNT

30:12.685 --> 30:14.062
AT MCDONALD'S,
SHE'S TOO OLD FOR YOU, BRO!

30:14.145 --> 30:16.064
- [laughs]

30:16.147 --> 30:17.524
- THERE'S NO GIRL
TOO OLD FOR ME.

30:17.607 --> 30:18.775
- IF SHE'S STILL COLLECTING
HER SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK,

30:18.858 --> 30:20.235
SHE'S TOO OLD FOR YOU, BRO.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.569
- HER AGE MATCHES THE
SPEED LIMIT ON THE TURNPIKE,

30:21.653 --> 30:23.613
SHE'S TOO OLD FOR YOU, BRO.

30:23.696 --> 30:24.614
[laughter]

30:24.697 --> 30:25.949
- NO AGE GAP.

30:26.032 --> 30:28.409
- I LIKE COUGARS, YOU KNOW,
AND THEY JUST GOTTA LOOK GOOD.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.662
[cheers and applause]

30:30.745 --> 30:31.996
- WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK,
BUT WHEN WE COME BACK,

30:32.080 --> 30:35.250
HEADS WILL BE CRACKED
AND SWAGGER WILL BE SWACKED.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.961
{\an8}THIS IS
<i>JERSEY SHORE: THE REUNION.</i>

30:38.044 --> 30:41.005

SAY HELLO TO RONNIE.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.816
[cheers and applause]

30:59.899 --> 31:03.570
NOW RONNIE, YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSED
OF JACKING PAULY D'S SWAGGER

31:03.653 --> 31:04.862
THIS SUMMER IN ITALY.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.281
WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO SAY FOR THAT?

31:06.364 --> 31:08.491
- UM, I DON'T THINK
I JACKED PAULY'S SWAGGER.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.118
I MAY SAY A COUPLE THINGS
THAT HE SAYS

31:10.201 --> 31:11.369
BECAUSE I'M
AROUND HIM SO MUCH.

31:11.452 --> 31:14.289
HE SAYS THINGS THAT I SAY,
I SAY THINGS THAT VINNY SAYS.

31:14.372 --> 31:15.582
LIKE, IT GOES
AROUND THE HOUSE.

31:15.665 --> 31:17.834
AS FAR AS SWAGGER-JACKING,
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

31:17.917 --> 31:20.253
- WELL, IMITATION IS THE
SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY,

31:20.336 --> 31:22.630
AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE EVIDENCE.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.800
- DOGGONE IT! WAKE UP!

31:25.883 --> 31:28.469

31:28.553 --> 31:30.597
WHATEVER I DO
OR SAY OR WEAR,

31:30.680 --> 31:31.806
RONNIE DOES
THE SAME EXACT THING.

31:31.889 --> 31:33.141
BUSTED BIG TIME, YEAH!

31:33.224 --> 31:34.517

31:37.687 --> 31:39.689
{\an8}SO I UNDERSTAND,
BUT DAMN.

31:39.772 --> 31:41.441

31:45.945 --> 31:47.071

31:50.158 --> 31:53.369
{\an8}- YEAH, BUDDY.
BUSTED, BIG TIME!

31:53.453 --> 31:54.912
{\an8}- SWAGGER-JACKING EVERYBODY

{\an8}- THIS IS THE
GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

31:58.249 --> 32:02.503

LOOK FOR YOU, MY DUDE!

32:02.587 --> 32:04.422

WITH PRIDE, RONNIE.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.112
- [laughs]

32:28.196 --> 32:29.280
- MIKE, IS SWACKING
A PRETTY BIG OFFENSE?

32:29.364 --> 32:33.117
HOW MANY YEARS DOES, UH,
THAT STAY ON YOUR RECORD FOR?

32:33.201 --> 32:34.202

YOU KNOW, RON-RON JUICE,
SMOOSH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

32:36.829 --> 32:37.872
THERE'S WORDS

32:37.955 --> 32:39.916
SO, YOU KNOW,
WE ALL USE EACH OTHER'S WORDS.

32:39.999 --> 32:42.251
SO THERE'S NO, UH--
NO, LIKE, SENTENCING.

32:42.335 --> 32:45.380
- RONNIE, WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU DO

32:45.463 --> 32:47.006
THAT YOU'VE OFFICIALLY BEEN
ACCUSED OF STEALING SWAGGER FOR?

32:47.090 --> 32:49.550
- DEFINITELY SAYING
THE THINGS THAT PAULY SAY.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.636
LIKE I SAID,
THE KID, IT'S CONTAGIOUS.

32:51.719 --> 32:53.930
I LIVE WITH HIM
ALL THE TIME.

32:54.013 --> 32:55.973
AND PAULY WAS JUST ANGRY 'CAUSE
I WOKE HIM UP THAT MORNING

32:56.057 --> 32:57.517
THE WAY HE WAKES ME UP
EVERY MORNING IN THE HOUSE.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.893

33:03.815 --> 33:05.400
THE CHAINS, THE SHOES.

33:05.483 --> 33:08.069
- THE SHOES I ALWAYS ROCKED.
THE CHAIN, I GOT--

33:08.152 --> 33:09.445
PAULY GOT ME

IT'S EXPENSIVE BEING HIS FRIEND,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

33:10.905 --> 33:13.366
[bleep] STANDING NEXT

33:15.910 --> 33:16.994
YOU GUYS CAN HEAD
BACK TO YOUR SEATS,

33:17.078 --> 33:18.746
BECAUSE LORD KNOWS
WE DON'T WANT

33:18.830 --> 33:20.873
TO SPLIT YOU TWO
LOVEBIRDS UP.

33:20.957 --> 33:23.126

33:23.209 --> 33:25.378
[cheers and applause]

33:25.461 --> 33:26.754
AND RONNIE, THANK YOU FOR
BEING A GOOD SPORT ABOUT THAT.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.923
- OF COURSE, I KNOW.

33:29.006 --> 33:33.261
[cheers and applause]

33:33.344 --> 33:35.763
AND NOW LET'S
SHAKE THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.349
LET'S SAY HELLO TO SAMMI
AND MIKE "THE SITUATION."

33:38.433 --> 33:39.434
COME ON UP, GUYS.

33:39.517 --> 33:42.103
[cheers and applause]

33:42.186 --> 33:44.856
- HEY, BRO.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.232

33:46.315 --> 33:48.317
- HOW'S YOUR NECK
FEELING THESE DAYS?

33:48.401 --> 33:50.611
- UH, THE NECK WAS HEALED
PROBABLY AFTER A DAY OR TWO.

33:50.695 --> 33:51.988
FEELS FINE.
- FEELING OKAY?

33:52.071 --> 33:53.156
- YEAH.

33:53.239 --> 33:55.992
- MIKE, AFTER YOU RAN
INTO A WALL AT FULL SPEED...

33:56.075 --> 33:57.827
- YES.

33:57.910 --> 33:58.453
- YOU SUNK INTO A DEPRESSION.
- [coughs]

33:58.536 --> 34:01.122
- LET'S WATCH.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.123
- I DON'T GET THE PROBLEM
WITH Y'ALL'S RELATIONSHIP!

34:02.206 --> 34:05.168
- I HAVE A LOT OF ANGER
BUILT UP TO MIKE.

34:05.251 --> 34:06.294
{\an8}- MIKE, STOP IT!

34:06.377 --> 34:07.837
{\an8}- LET'S DO IT!
- STOP!

34:07.920 --> 34:09.755
{\an8}- LET'S--UNH!

34:09.839 --> 34:12.216
{\an8}- MIKE BASHED HIS HEAD
INTO THE WALL.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.926
{\an8}- GET THE [bleep]
AWAY FROM ME!

34:14.010 --> 34:15.762
{\an8}- STOP, RON!
- SHUT THE [bleep] UP!

34:15.844 --> 34:16.929
{\an8}STOP TALKING TO ME!

34:17.013 --> 34:18.931
{\an8}- WALK AWAY FROM IT!

34:19.014 --> 34:20.391
{\an8}- I [bleep] GET IT!

34:20.475 --> 34:22.560
{\an8}- YOU NEED TO WALK AWAY
AND LEAVE THIS GUY ALONE

34:22.643 --> 34:25.563
{\an8}BECAUSE YOU'RE THE REASON
WHY HE'S GETTING SO AMPED UP.

34:25.646 --> 34:28.608
{\an8}[ambulance siren]

34:28.690 --> 34:31.027
{\an8}- MIKE'S NEW NAME
IS NO LONGER "THE SITUATION."

34:31.110 --> 34:33.154
{\an8}IT'S NOW
"THE HOSPITALIZATION."

34:33.237 --> 34:35.572
{\an8}- THE DOCTOR'S PROGNOSIS
WAS A LIGHT CONCUSSION,

34:35.656 --> 34:36.324
{\an8}ALSO COMBINED WITH
A NECK SPRAIN AS WELL.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.367
{\an8}OOH.

34:38.451 --> 34:41.161
{\an8}THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ME AND RON,
IT'S UNSETTLED,

34:41.245 --> 34:43.748
{\an8}BECAUSE NOBODY GOT THE BETTER
OF EACH OTHER IN ROUND ONE.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.583
{\an8}MMMM.

34:45.666 --> 34:47.001
{\an8}[audience laughs]

34:47.085 --> 34:49.253
{\an8}- CAN YOU SEE ME?
I'M OVER HERE.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.005
{\an8}- DAMN, BRO, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T MOVE MY NECK.

34:51.088 --> 34:52.672
{\an8}- NOW I'M OVER HERE.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.132
{\an8}- THIS IS THE WORST.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.510
{\an8}- WOO-WOO-WOO-WE OUT.

34:55.592 --> 34:56.636
{\an8}YOU GOT YOUR NECK BRACE, BRO?

34:56.719 --> 34:57.887
- YEAH, I GOT IT.

34:57.970 --> 35:02.016
[cheers and applause]

35:02.099 --> 35:04.727
- MIKE AND RONNIE,
NOW THAT YOU GUYS HAVE HAD

35:04.811 --> 35:05.853
SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THE FIGHT,
DO YOU REGRET IT?

35:05.937 --> 35:08.481
- UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
- NO.

35:08.564 --> 35:10.149
- I NEVER REGRET ANYTHING, NO.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.400
- I REALIZED THAT WHAT
I WAS DOING WAS NOT RIGHT.

35:11.484 --> 35:13.569
I LIVED WITH THE KID
FOUR HOUSES IN A ROW.

35:13.653 --> 35:14.862
HE'S LITERALLY MY ROOMMATE,
LIKE, I SLEEP NEXT TO HIM.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.698
BUT IT WAS AT A POINT WHERE
I'D ALREADY LAID MY HANDS ON HIM

35:17.782 --> 35:19.575
SO NOW ALL I CAN DO
IS JUST DEFEND MYSELF.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.078
- WE WERE JUST GOING FORWARD,
BACK AND FORTH,

35:22.161 --> 35:24.872
SO I'M GLAD THAT WE DIDN'T HURT
EACH OTHER BECAUSE AT THE END

35:24.956 --> 35:26.707
OF THE DAY,
WE REALLY ARE BROTHERS.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.668
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
AND WE MADE UP THE NEXT DAY.

35:28.751 --> 35:30.211
AND, YOU KNOW, NONE OF THE GUYS
SHOULD FIGHT LIKE THAT.

35:30.294 --> 35:30.837
- JUST THE GIRLS.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.132
[cheers and applause]

35:34.215 --> 35:34.674
- RONNIE, DO YOU REGRET
MIKE RUNNING HIS HEAD

35:34.757 --> 35:37.426
INTO A BRICK WALL?

35:37.510 --> 35:38.553
- YEAH, I WISH HE WOULD
HAVE CHARGED AT ME FIRST...

35:38.636 --> 35:39.595
- YEAH, YEAH.
- INSTEAD OF THE WALL.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.556
- SEE, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT THE WALLS IN ITALY

35:41.639 --> 35:42.974
WERE STONE.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.810
AND SO WHEN I
WAS GONNA FIGHT HIM,

35:45.893 --> 35:48.187
I WAS, LIKE,
I'M GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.940
SO I KNOCKED MYSELF OUT
BEFORE WE EVEN FOUGHT.

35:51.023 --> 35:51.941
- YOU GOTTA DO
WHAT I DO, BRO.

35:52.024 --> 35:54.402
YOU JUST GOTTA
FLIP [bleep].

35:54.485 --> 35:56.320
- YEAH, YEAH,
HE LIKES TO REDECORATE.

35:56.404 --> 35:57.321
I LIKE TO BANG MY HEAD
AGAINST A WALL.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.740
- SAMMI, WHY WOULDN'T YOU
LEAVE RONNIE ALONE

35:59.824 --> 36:00.908
DURING THAT FIGHT?

36:00.992 --> 36:03.411
- I THINK 'CAUSE I WAS JUST
SO EMOTIONALLY DISTRAUGHT

36:03.494 --> 36:05.538
AND I SAW, LIKE, MY BOYFRIEND,
LIKE, THE KID I LOVE, LIKE,

36:05.621 --> 36:10.751
SO ANGRY AND I FELT LIKE I WAS
THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN HELP HIM.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.420
- RONNIE, WAS SAMMI MAKING
THINGS WORSE BY STAYING

36:12.503 --> 36:13.921
IN THE ROOM WITH YOU?

36:14.005 --> 36:14.839
- YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S, LIKE, I'M TRYING TO

36:14.922 --> 36:16.257
DO WHAT I HAVE
TO DO WITH HIM,

36:16.340 --> 36:19.135
AND THEN SHE'S IN BETWEEN ME
SCREAMING AT ME, LIKE,

36:19.218 --> 36:20.511
YELLING AT ME
AND IT'S, LIKE,

36:20.595 --> 36:22.513
THE MORE I SAY
"GET AWAY FROM ME,"

36:22.597 --> 36:23.931
THE MORE SHE, LIKE,
TOOK IT THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.182
SHE WAS, LIKE, "ALL RIGHT,
COME CLOSER, COME CLOSER."

36:25.266 --> 36:27.935
- I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN THERE, BUT AT THAT TIME

36:28.019 --> 36:28.978
I THOUGHT THAT I
COULD MAKE IT ALL BETTER.

36:29.061 --> 36:29.896
- MIKE, WHEN YOU CAME BACK
FROM THE HOSPITAL,

36:29.979 --> 36:32.106
WERE YOU IN
PRETTY BAD SHAPE?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.358
- PROBABLY MENTALLY
AND PHYSICALLY,

36:34.442 --> 36:35.860
BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL
GOING UPON THEIR LIVES,

36:35.943 --> 36:38.321
AND I'M IN THE HOUSE
ALL WEEK BY MYSELF.

36:38.404 --> 36:40.114
I CAN'T EVEN REACH
A FRICKIN' SODA,

36:40.197 --> 36:41.365
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?

36:41.449 --> 36:43.117
SO I WAS KIND OF UPSET,
YOU KNOW, FOR A LITTLE BIT.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.453
BUT EVENTUALLY,
UH, I GOT OUT OF IT.

36:45.536 --> 36:46.829
- WERE YOU MILKING IT
A LITTLE BIT?

36:46.913 --> 36:47.997
- I MAY HAVE MADE IT
WORSE IN MY HEAD TO BE, LIKE,

36:48.080 --> 36:50.124
FEELING SORRY
FOR MYSELF, LIKE,

36:50.207 --> 36:51.542
"WHY DID I RUN
INTO THE WALL?"

36:51.626 --> 36:53.210
LIKE, NOW, LIKE, ALL THE OTHER
ROOMMATES ARE ALIENATING ME.

36:53.294 --> 36:56.172
SO EVENTUALLY I HAD TO
WORK MYSELF OUT OF THAT.

36:56.255 --> 36:58.007
- ALL RIGHT, LET ME
ASK YOUR ROOMMATES.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.342
DID YOU GUYS
FEEL LIKE MIKE WAS

36:59.425 --> 37:00.217
PUTTING ON
A LITTLE BIT OF AN ACT?

37:00.301 --> 37:02.511
- HE LOOKED LIKE
A CARTOON CHARACTER.

37:02.595 --> 37:05.348
AND THEN WHENEVER HE WOULD TALK
HE WOULD BE LIKE THIS

37:05.431 --> 37:07.683
AND I FELT LIKE I WAS
TALKING TO A FLOATING HEAD.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.060
- HE DEFINITELY
USED THAT [bleep]

37:09.143 --> 37:10.186
TO GET OUT OF WORK THOUGH,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

37:10.269 --> 37:12.647
- THERE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN A DAY

37:12.730 --> 37:15.066
THAT I MIGHT HAVE
MILKED IT, MAYBE.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.026
[laughter]

37:17.109 --> 37:19.153
- WE DO HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK,
BUT WHEN WE COME BACK

37:19.236 --> 37:21.489
WE'LL CHECK OUT SOME NEVER
BEFORE SEEN PHOTOS TAKEN

37:21.572 --> 37:23.824
BY OUR FAVORITE ROOMMATES
DURING THEIR TIME IN ITALY.

37:23.908 --> 37:27.119
DON'T GO ANYWHERE, THIS IS
<i>JERSEY SHORE: THE REUNION.</i>

37:27.203 --> 37:31.374
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

37:33.042 --> 37:36.170
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

37:36.253 --> 37:39.757
{\an8}- WELCOME BACK TO
<i>JERSEY SHORE: THE REUNION.</i>

37:39.840 --> 37:43.386
{\an8}I'M AMY AND I'M HERE WITH
THE ENTIRE <i> JERSEY SHORE</i> CAST.

37:43.469 --> 37:45.346
{\an8}WHILE YOU GUYS WERE IN ITALY
YOU COULDN'T REALLY WORK OUT,

37:45.429 --> 37:47.181
YOU COULDN'T GO TANNING,
YOU COULDN'T GET

37:47.264 --> 37:48.975
YOUR HAIR AND NAILS DID.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.060
BUT YOU DID MANAGE TO
TAKE SOME GREAT PHOTOS.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.353
CHECK THIS OUT.

37:52.436 --> 37:56.107
- GUIDO PROBLEMS ARE PROBLEMS
THAT EVERYDAY PEOPLE

37:56.190 --> 37:57.441
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.987
IF I WERE TO TELL SOMEBODY,
"I CAN'T GO OUT TONIGHT

38:01.070 --> 38:03.155
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
A HAIRCUT IN FOUR DAYS,"

38:03.239 --> 38:05.199
THEY WOULD LOOK AT ME
LIKE I WAS [bleep] CRAZY.

38:05.282 --> 38:06.951
LINE UP, HUH?

38:07.034 --> 38:08.369
[razor buzzing]

38:08.452 --> 38:09.620
I'M NOT GONNA LIE,
IT'S MY FIRST HAIRCUT

38:09.704 --> 38:10.788
I'VE EVER GIVEN.

38:10.871 --> 38:11.998
- IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

38:12.081 --> 38:14.250
{\an8}- IT'S UNEVEN.
- IT'S UNEVEN!

38:14.333 --> 38:15.501
{\an8}[turns off razor]

38:15.584 --> 38:16.502
{\an8}- WHOOPS!
I TOOK IT OFF.

38:16.585 --> 38:19.505
{\an8}- THAT'S A LOT OF HAIR
THAT JUST FELL OFF.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.257
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE I'M
FRIAR TUCK RIGHT NOW.

38:21.340 --> 38:26.012
{\an8}[monks chanting]
- WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP?

38:26.095 --> 38:28.431
{\an8}- IT'S DEFINITELY HARD TO
STAY FRESH TO DEATH IN ITALY,

38:28.514 --> 38:31.809
{\an8}BUT YOU BEST BELIEVE
I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN.

38:31.892 --> 38:33.811
{\an8}- LOOKS LIKE PAPA SMURF
GAVE A [bleep]JOB.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.855
{\an8}- GOD, WHY IS IT SMOKING?
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

38:35.938 --> 38:37.565
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD, NO!
IT BURNS.

38:37.648 --> 38:38.691
{\an8}THIS IS, LIKE--IT REALLY,
LIKE, TOOK OFF MY HAIR.

38:38.774 --> 38:41.360
{\an8}- [gasps]

38:41.444 --> 38:42.069
{\an8}- MY HAIR
CAME OFF OF MY HEAD,

38:42.153 --> 38:43.946
{\an8}AND ONTO THIS FRICKIN' IRON.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.073
- LET'S HAVE A VOTE.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.867
WHO WANTS TO LEAVE ITALY
AND GO TO JERSEY?

38:47.950 --> 38:49.785
[laughs]

38:49.869 --> 38:53.205
- I WANNA GO BACK TO JERSEY
SO [bleep] BAD YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.916
I WANNA GO TO DTL IN JERSEY.
- MUSCLE MAKER.

38:56.000 --> 38:56.792
- HAIRCUTS.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.294
- I WANNA TAN TWICE
WHEN I GET THERE.

38:58.377 --> 38:59.587
- I'LL TAN THREE TIMES.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.130
- AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WE DIDN'T KILL EACH OTHER,

39:01.213 --> 39:03.716
AND NOBODY
ENDED UP IN JAIL.

39:03.799 --> 39:06.635
- ITALY...
[speaking Italian]

39:06.719 --> 39:08.304
PEACE!

39:08.387 --> 39:11.432
- I'M GOING BACK TO JERSEY,
I'M GONNA GTL MY ASS OFF.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.559
- ITALY, CIAO,
IT'S NICE KNOWIN' YA.

39:17.688 --> 39:18.064
[cheers and applause]

39:18.147 --> 39:20.608
- YEAH, BUDDY!

39:20.691 --> 39:21.942
AAH!

39:22.026 --> 39:24.904
- I GOT GOOSE BUMPS.
- YEAH, THAT WAS CUTE.

39:24.987 --> 39:27.281
- WHY COULDN'T YOU GUYS WAIT
TO GET BACK TO JERSEY?

39:27.364 --> 39:28.657
- I HAD TO GO TANNING.

39:28.741 --> 39:29.950
- IT WAS A LOT
- IT'S HOME.

39:30.034 --> 39:33.204
- LIKE, GTL, LIKE, JUST
GETTING TO OUR OWN LIFESTYLE.

39:33.287 --> 39:34.288
- YEAH, FAMILY, FRIENDS.
- WE MISSED IT.

39:34.371 --> 39:35.414
- EVERYTHING LIKE THAT.

39:35.498 --> 39:36.707
- GYM, TANNING, LAUNDRY.
GYM, TANNING, LAUNDRY.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.042
GYM, TANNING, LAUNDRY.
IT'S A WAY OF LIFE.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.043
- WHAT DID YOU MISS
MOST ABOUT SEASIDE?

39:39.126 --> 39:41.128
- TANNING.
- TANNING.

39:41.212 --> 39:41.796
- KARMA.
- HAIRCUT.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.632
- LEGAL WOMEN.

39:44.715 --> 39:45.716
[cheers and applause]

39:45.800 --> 39:47.176
- YOU GUYS, WHY DO YOU THINK
THE BARBERS IN ITALY

39:47.259 --> 39:49.512
COULDN'T GIVE YOU
A GOOD HAIRCUT?

39:49.595 --> 39:50.888
- THEY DON'T GET OUR STYLE.
- NAH.

39:50.971 --> 39:52.139
- THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT A TAPE UP IS.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.891
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT A FADE IS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

39:53.974 --> 39:54.892
- THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT A BLOWOUT IS.

39:54.975 --> 39:55.976
- AT LEAST I KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.770
- VINNY SAID THAT
HE KNEW HOW TO CUT HAIR,

39:57.853 --> 39:58.354
SO WE WERE, LIKE, "ALL RIGHT,
WELL, WE'RE GONNA GO TO

39:58.437 --> 39:59.980
VINNY'S BARBER SHOP."

40:00.064 --> 40:01.065
IT WAS REALLY
A BUTCHER SHOP.

40:01.148 --> 40:02.316
- [chuckles]

40:02.399 --> 40:03.359
- I WAS IN ROME,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL

40:03.442 --> 40:04.568
MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE CAESAR, RIGHT?

40:04.652 --> 40:05.861
- EXACTLY.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.446
- AND MIKE, WHAT WAS
THAT MUD ON YOUR FACE?

40:07.530 --> 40:08.489
WHAT DOES THAT DO?

40:08.572 --> 40:09.115
- HE'S GOT AN ARSENAL
OF FACE CREAM.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.866
- I'VE GOT AN ARSENAL.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.493
- HE'S GOT A GANG
OF FACE WASHES.

40:12.576 --> 40:15.454
- I GOT SO MANY FACE WASHES,
MY FACE WASHES GOT FACE WASHES.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.498
- DEENA, WHAT WAS THE SITUATION
WITH THE HAIR STRAIGHTENERS?

40:17.581 --> 40:19.333
- ONE WOULD BLOW OUT,
ONE WOULD JUST

40:19.416 --> 40:20.543
TAKE MY HAIR RIGHT OFF.

40:20.626 --> 40:22.545
- SO IT MADE IT PRETTY TOUGH
TO GET ALL PRETTY

40:22.628 --> 40:24.380
TO GO TO
THE VATICAN, HUH?

40:24.463 --> 40:26.715
- THE DRAMA.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.009
- HOW MUCH OF A FAMILY
ARE YOU GUYS ALL AT THIS POINT?

40:29.093 --> 40:31.971
- I LOVE YOU GUYS!
- UH.

40:32.054 --> 40:32.972
YEAH, NO,
WE'RE DEFINITELY A BIG FAMILY.

40:33.055 --> 40:34.557
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.142
- BUT GOING TO ITALY
MADE YOU GUYS CLOSER?

40:36.225 --> 40:37.560
- 100%.
- 100%.

40:37.643 --> 40:38.644
- I THINK IT DID.

40:38.727 --> 40:40.020
- EVEN THOUGH YOU
FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER

40:40.104 --> 40:42.356
YOU STILL SHARE A BOND
THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY.

40:42.439 --> 40:43.357
- SO YOU GUYS ARE READY

40:43.440 --> 40:44.525
TO JUMP RIGHT BACK IN
SEASIDE HEIGHTS?

40:44.608 --> 40:46.986
all: JERSEY!

40:47.069 --> 40:48.988
[cheers and applause]

40:49.071 --> 40:52.158
- WELL, UNFORTUNATELY OUR
TIME HERE HAS COME TO AN END.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.410
IT LOOKED LIKE YOU GUYS
HAD AN AMAZING TIME THIS SUMMER

40:54.493 --> 40:57.538
IN ITALY AND IT WAS SO MUCH FUN
TO TUNE IN EVERY WEEK

40:57.621 --> 41:00.207
{\an8}ANXIOUSLY AWAITING
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.041
{\an8}I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU GUYS
FOR BEING HERE,

41:01.125 --> 41:03.419
{\an8}BEING SUCH GOOD SPORTS.

41:03.502 --> 41:05.713
{\an8}I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR
AUDIENCE FOR BEING HERE WITH US.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.006
{\an8}AND THANK YOU AT HOME
