WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:04.138
(children chatter indistinctly)

00:04.172 --> 00:06.307
(sighs)
Is your aunt always this late?

00:06.340 --> 00:08.642
She said
she's on Irish time.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.478
(door opens)
MICKEY:
Hey.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.645
Sorry I'm late.
Hey, buddy.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.314
BEN:
Hi.
MICKEY: Stuck

00:13.347 --> 00:15.649
in, uh, traffic
for over an hour. Ew.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.686
Well, we have been waiting
for almost two hours.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.322
Well, I'm in the middle
of a very busy afternoon.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.556
What can I do for you?

00:22.590 --> 00:25.659
Ben is no longer
allowed to ride the bus.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.495
He's been urinating on it.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.697
That true, buddy?
You peeing on the bus?

00:29.730 --> 00:33.167
No. I peed
in Ryan Leggio's backpack.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.335
Well, that's still
not a bathroom.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.503
And then on his shoes

00:35.536 --> 00:37.171
when he called me a "pee freak."

00:37.205 --> 00:39.740
Okay, I can see how
that might be a problem.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.110
But look, in the kid's defense,
it's a brutal commute.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.578
I had to stop at a gas station
on the way here,

00:44.612 --> 00:46.080
or I would have peed myself.

00:46.114 --> 00:48.849
Uh, look, it's not just the bus.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.084
Ben has been

00:50.118 --> 00:51.519
doing poorly in his
classes, as well.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.287
Einstein flunked math.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.589
He's also having trouble
making friends.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.291
You think Bill Gates
had friends?
And

00:57.325 --> 01:00.194
he refuses
to wear his uniform properly.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.696
Oh. Huh. You know who else
refused to wear a uniform?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.865
Muhammad Ali, The Champ.

01:04.898 --> 01:09.303
Did The Champ
wear high heels?

01:09.337 --> 01:11.472
Look, give him a break.
The kid probably misses his mom.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.606
They're Sabrina's.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.542
Look, if Ben can't

01:14.575 --> 01:16.744
change his behavior, I think
that we're going to have to...

01:16.777 --> 01:19.147
You're going to have
to what? Boot him?

01:19.180 --> 01:20.881
(laughing):
Oh, no, buddy.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.217
Too late. We reject you.

01:23.251 --> 01:26.887
Yeah. That kid's special, okay?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.722
Not special like he...

01:28.756 --> 01:30.658
He-He's just a special kid.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.394
And if you can't see that,
you can burn in hell.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.397
Okay. Well, I wish you luck.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.566
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I wish you luck,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.568
because your school is a mess.
Have you met the other

01:40.601 --> 01:42.636
two Pemberton kids
you've educated?

01:42.670 --> 01:44.505
Yes, I know Chip
and Sabrina.
Yeah.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.407
Well, this place has
just about ruined them.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.342
You're running
a crap factory here, pal.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.411
Just churning out crap. Ugh!

01:50.444 --> 01:52.513
Look at this kid.
Are you kidding me?

01:52.546 --> 01:53.747
That kid sucks.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.249
Sucks, sucks.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.350
This is a great school

01:56.384 --> 01:58.352
to come to if you want
your kid to suck.

01:58.386 --> 02:01.422
Oh, look, here comes another
guy. You suck!
Well,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.357
it's the middle of the school
year. I think you're gonna

02:03.391 --> 02:05.259
find it very difficult
to find any school

02:05.293 --> 02:07.161
that's willing to...
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.929
You're not the only game
in town, buddy, okay?

02:08.962 --> 02:11.299
This school's a joke,
and not a good one.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.600
Then I think
we're done here.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.668
No.think we're done here.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.513
Should I go with her?

02:25.546 --> 02:27.381
Regrettably.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.823
MICKEY:
Seven schools?

02:35.856 --> 02:37.225
Who gets rejected
by seven schools?

02:37.258 --> 02:38.826
Maybe you should have thought
about that before

02:38.859 --> 02:41.329
you took him out of the best
prep school in the country.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.863
Yeah, well, maybe
I didn't think it through,

02:42.896 --> 02:45.333
'cause I was too focused
on how much Lockwood sucks.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.800
And by the way, your
principal's a real tool.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.402
Nice influence.
I mean,

02:48.436 --> 02:50.971
what is the problem? The kid's
got an odd fashion sense.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.840
What's wrong
with my fashion senses?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.542
Oh, hey, buddy.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.210
Uh... nothing.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.546
Not a thing. I think
you look very handsome.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.314
Uh, you want to go play
in the other room?

03:00.348 --> 03:02.916
So you can keep
talking about me? Okay.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.818
So I can keep talking about you.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.854
That is a smart kid.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.856
I do not understand why
he can't get into a school.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.358
Oh, come on.
Don't be naive.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.725
We all know
the real reason.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.860
Here we go.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.995
Frederico Diaz, 3.0,

03:15.028 --> 03:17.431
crapped the bed on the SATs,
gets into Brown.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.334
Meanwhile, Dustin Wakefield--
straight A's,

03:20.368 --> 03:22.236
school treasurer--
gets into Wesleyan.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.371
Disgraceful.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.838
What are you talking about?
It's never

03:24.872 --> 03:26.940
been harder to be a white male
than it is right now.

03:26.974 --> 03:30.578
I'm gonna have to work twice
as hard to achieve half as much.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.945
Preach, brother.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.582
I haven't had a
win in 37 years.
SABRINA:
Oh, come on.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.749
Try being a woman.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.585
At least I understand the plight
of diverse people.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.787
What?!
You two are about as diverse

03:39.820 --> 03:41.021
as a Jimmy Buffet concert.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.790
I would call you racist,

03:42.823 --> 03:44.525
but you only hang out
with white people.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.893
So I guess
that makes you separatists.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.928
You don't know who
I hang out with.
Okay.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.763
Name one
non-white friend.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.898
(scoffs)

03:50.931 --> 03:52.032
Alba.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.468
Alba. Super not white.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.903
Oh, don't drag
me into this.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.638
Alba is not your friend.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.440
You do not yell at your friend

03:59.473 --> 04:00.774
for putting dressing
on your salad.

04:00.808 --> 04:01.975
You know nothing
about her.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.377
I know plenty about her.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.612
What's her last name?

04:04.645 --> 04:07.281
Gonzalez?
Perez.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.049
Maldanado.
That's a tough
start, guys.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.784
MICKEY:
You have lived with Alba

04:10.818 --> 04:13.721
your entire lives, and you don't
know her full name?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.489
Alba is a rich

04:15.523 --> 04:16.624
fountain of culture.

04:16.657 --> 04:17.791
Guzzle from her.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.328
You know what, Alba?
Hmm?

04:20.361 --> 04:23.063
Tomorrow, me and you--
we're going out. On me.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.833
And I want to know
every single thing about you,

04:25.866 --> 04:27.735
because you are my new friend.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.571
That sounds good.
Okay. (laughs)

04:30.604 --> 04:32.673
Count me in.
I frickin' love diversity.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.075
Yeah, uh, okay, I got to
get Ben into a good school.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.810
I cannot have him
turning out like you.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.412
Look, there's only
two schools that are

04:38.446 --> 04:39.747
accepting students right now--

04:39.780 --> 04:41.349
the all-girls school
across the street

04:41.382 --> 04:43.651
and the public school, but
it's, like, 40 minutes away.

04:43.684 --> 04:46.420
Well, enjoy the drive.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.456
(sighs)

04:50.558 --> 04:52.826
I know the first day
at a new school can be tough,

04:52.860 --> 04:54.428
but you just remember
to be yourself,

04:54.462 --> 04:56.364
and you'll be just fine.

04:56.397 --> 04:59.166
I'm a transformer!

04:59.199 --> 05:00.934
Yeah. Sure.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.136
Transformer. Close enough.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.543
So, am I a girl now?

05:09.577 --> 05:11.445
No, only when
you're at school.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.013
Or whenever else
you want to be.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.115
Cool. Do I
have a vagina?

05:15.148 --> 05:17.385
No, you don't.
Any other questions?

05:17.418 --> 05:20.120
What is a vagina?

05:20.153 --> 05:23.791
Oh, that's like,
right up the... in between...

05:23.824 --> 05:25.125
You got...

05:25.158 --> 05:27.461
Can I get back to you
on that one?

05:27.495 --> 05:28.962
Okay.
Thanks, buddy.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.499
You look really good
in that dress, by the way.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.734
Thanks. It's breezy
on my vagina.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.803
Yeah. Yeah, maybe
don't mention that, though.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.471
Now, listen,
there are three things

05:37.505 --> 05:38.806
you've got to remember
today, okay?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.841
Number one:
go wherever the girls go,

05:40.874 --> 05:42.142
do whatever the girls do.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.144
Number two--
and this one's critical-- you...

05:44.177 --> 05:47.648
What? Are we here already?
My God, that's close. Nice.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.816
All right.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.718
Sorry we're late.
You know how fussy

05:50.751 --> 05:52.753
little girls are getting ready.
Well, we are

05:52.786 --> 05:55.489
thrilled to have our very first
transgender student.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.024
Oh, say thank you, Ben.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.693
I thought you said
my name was "Beth."
Yes.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.095
That's what I said. He still
gets confused sometimes.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.664
Well, you mean "she"?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.599
Yeah, yeah,
that's what I mean.

06:05.633 --> 06:06.867
You'll get it.
Don't worry about it.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.869
Hey, Ben... th...
why don't you run outside

06:08.902 --> 06:10.604
to the playground
while we finish up,

06:10.638 --> 06:12.039
okay?
Okay.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.674
Should I do
the thing now?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.676
Yeah.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.078
Oh!
(Mickey laughs)

06:18.111 --> 06:19.913
(loud, overlapping
chatter and shouting)

06:19.947 --> 06:22.182
Want to play dolls?
I'm not really
into dolls.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.884
Want to play
super smash ball?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.953
It's like dodge ball,
except we're all ninjas.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.088
Okay.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.092
So, Alba, tell us
more about Guatemala.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.595
Oh. Uh, okay.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.765
Well, the national flower

06:37.798 --> 06:39.767
is the White Nun Orchid,

06:39.800 --> 06:42.069
and the national bird...
Oh, wait. Hold on.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.104
I want to write this down so
I can throw it in Mickey's face.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.906
Oh, okay.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.643
Uh, the national bird
is the quetzal.

06:49.677 --> 06:54.648
And, uh, oh, the
population is 12.7 million.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.617
Wow.
Alba, this is delicious.
Is this eggplant?

06:56.650 --> 06:58.819
No, it's beef.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.721
(gasps)
(laughs)

07:00.754 --> 07:02.623
Alba, you know
I don't eat red meat.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.991
Why would you order this?

07:04.024 --> 07:06.560
That is strange.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.828
It must be regional.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.730
You know, where I'm from,
it's vegetarian.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.565
No, pepian is always beef.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.634
No, it's not. No. Take it away.
No. Get it out of here.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.969
No. That's not good.
Not where I come from. No.

07:16.003 --> 07:19.239
Alba? Why is your phone on
the Guatemala Wikipedia page?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.074
Is it?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.777
Alba. What's going on?

07:24.978 --> 07:27.648
Well, okay, I'm from Guatemala,

07:30.083 --> 07:30.450
What? I came here

07:31.284 --> 07:32.953
as a little girl, so my culture

07:32.986 --> 07:34.822
is your culture.
Are you kidding me?

07:34.855 --> 07:37.024
I just blew eight years
of no red meat for nothing?

07:37.057 --> 07:38.626
Why didn't you
just tell us?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.260
I don't know. Uh,

07:40.293 --> 07:41.929
when I saw how much
you guys wanted

07:41.962 --> 07:43.764
to hang out with me,
I got excited.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.599
Now I feel terrible.
The whole point of this

07:45.633 --> 07:46.934
was to get to know you better.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.869
No, the whole point of
this was to hang out

07:48.902 --> 07:51.672
with somebody diverse so
we could shut Mickey up.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.107
Ignore him.
Alba, is there anywhere

07:54.141 --> 07:55.876
that you actually like going?

07:55.909 --> 07:59.780
Well... there is this
one place I really love.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.848
Okay, good, let's go there.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.016
But first let's send
a selfie to Mickey.
Oh.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.852
Oh, wait.
Oh.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.688
#ChipsAndGuac.
(chuckles)

08:07.721 --> 08:09.623
(birds chirping)

08:09.657 --> 08:12.225
Getting Ben into a school
across the street was genius.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.862
He is cranking through my
mascara like a street whore,

08:14.895 --> 08:16.530
but it's worth it.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.298
Hey, you mind
if I go bare-ass?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.200
I'd really rather
you did not.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.002
(phone vibrating)

08:24.204 --> 08:25.305
Hello.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.574
Yep.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.743
What, you mean right now?

08:29.777 --> 08:31.579
Oh, gosh, I'd love to,

08:31.612 --> 08:33.847
but I'm kind of
right in the middle of...

08:34.948 --> 08:36.083
Okay.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.086
Yeah, I get it.
All right, I'll be right there.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.589
Everything okay?
Mm-hmm.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.591
Just got to hike
over to Ben's school.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.593
You want to come with me?
No.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.662
I'm gonna stay here and cook
off some of these tan lines.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.698
*

08:52.299 --> 08:54.234
(disgusted groan)

08:54.267 --> 08:56.837
* Ooh, my little pretty one,
pretty one *

08:56.870 --> 08:59.006
* When you gonna give me some

08:59.039 --> 09:01.041
* Time, Sharona
Alba, I had no idea

09:01.074 --> 09:03.744
you liked karaoke--
that's so cool and interesting.
Oh,

09:03.777 --> 09:07.981
I love it. As a little girl,
I dreamed of being Elton John.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.618
All right,
everyone keep their eyes peeled

09:10.651 --> 09:11.919
for an ethnic person.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.687
You're the reason
people hate us.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.956
Jealousy is the reason
people hate us.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.191
Alba, what song
are you gonna sing later?

09:18.225 --> 09:19.226
(laughs):
Oh, no, no.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.630
I only sing in the shower
or the car

09:22.663 --> 09:23.931
or doing dishes,
you know,

09:23.964 --> 09:25.365
getting dressed
or folding clothes,

09:25.398 --> 09:29.069
but never in front of anyone--
I could never do that, no.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.138
Okay, this is what
I'm talking about.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.607
Hey, man, where are you from?
Nigeria.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.142
Jackpot.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.143
* My, my

09:36.176 --> 09:38.111
* My-yi whoo!

09:38.145 --> 09:39.913
GIRLS:
I'm a little Dutch girl

09:39.947 --> 09:41.715
dressed in blue.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.250
These are the things

09:43.283 --> 09:45.052
that I can do.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.286
What are you doing here?

09:46.319 --> 09:48.588
Hi! I just came to
see your principal.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.390
I see you made
some new friends.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.325
Yeah. I really like
this girl Jennifer.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.662
Does that make me a lesbian?

09:54.695 --> 09:56.163
You don't have to worry
about labels, buddy.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.298
Just like who you like.
Good. 'Cause I also like

09:58.331 --> 09:59.900
this kid named Brad
from my old school.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.302
Sweet. Keep your
options open.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.837
See you in a bit.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.305
GIRLS:
I can do the...

10:05.338 --> 10:07.274
Hope this is some
sort of an emergency.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.342
I was in the middle of
an important meeting.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.079
This is Gene,
a parent here.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.281
He has some concerns
regarding Beth.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.917
You kept me waiting,
so I'm gonna get right to it.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.019
My wife and I aren't comfortable
with our daughter

10:19.052 --> 10:21.755
sharing a bathroom
with a boy in a dress.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.992
I'm sorry, I don't know anything
about a boy in a dress.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.861
I know about a darling
little girl in a dress-- is that

10:27.895 --> 10:29.763
who you're talking
about, Gene?
Okay, look,

10:29.797 --> 10:31.699
I'm not trying to pass
any judgments here, all right?

10:31.732 --> 10:34.301
Anything anyone wants to do
or wear, I'm cool with.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.137
Well, would you
listen to that!

10:37.170 --> 10:40.140
Gene here is cool with the rest
of the world having free will.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.341
Thank you, Gene.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.876
I didn't mean it like that.
No?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.978
No. I'm just looking after
my daughter's safety.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.180
I mean, come on, it's
common sense, all right?

10:47.214 --> 10:50.150
That's why we have
a boys' room and a girls' room.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.954
I got news for you, friend.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.956
The world is a dangerous place.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.725
Nobody's safe.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.159
It does not take
a little boy

10:59.192 --> 11:01.328
in a dress
to molest your daughter.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.063
I use the girls' room.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.365
I could easily molest
her any time I want.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.366
Uh, please,

11:06.399 --> 11:07.901
let's not make this personal.

11:07.935 --> 11:08.969
I'm not done, Rita.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.204
I won't do it, Gene, okay?

11:11.238 --> 11:14.307
But maybe... not only
am I a sexual predator,

11:14.341 --> 11:16.076
maybe I'm liar.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.078
So maybe I will do it.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.146
Whoa.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.247
Okay.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.815
Stop for
just a moment.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.217
I understand this is
a very emotional issue.

11:24.251 --> 11:27.387
We thought we were ready
for this, but clearly we aren't.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.388
What?
So I'm sorry.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.524
Beth has to leave Barnsdale.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.261
(groans)

11:34.294 --> 11:35.863
No.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.866
No. This isn't over.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.871
You tell your daughter
to watch her back.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.782
Can you believe that bigot
chucked our little girl?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.784
I got to find a way
to get him back in.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.887
Now a transgender person
knows how it feels to be
white these days.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.388
Ben is white. And
he's not transgender.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.223
He just likes wearing
little girl's clothing.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.524
If anything,
he's gender-fluid.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.094
You know what? I'm proud
to be his big sister.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.129
No, don't make this your thing.
This is Ben's thing.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.764
It seems like
it's your thing.
I'm just trying

12:10.798 --> 12:12.432
to get your brother
into a school he likes.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.535
And if I can fight injustice
and slam my foot up her ass

12:15.568 --> 12:17.370
at the same time,
then that's a win.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.239
Oh, yeah, so suddenly
you're just this big friend

12:19.272 --> 12:20.808
of the LGBTQ community?

12:20.841 --> 12:22.042
Mm-hmm.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.243
Wh-What?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.145
Are you serious?
Lesbian-Gay-

12:25.178 --> 12:27.047
Bisexual-Transgender-
Questioning.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.049
Pretty sure the Q's
for "queer."

12:29.082 --> 12:30.217
No, "queer"
is offensive.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.551
Why? When I was growing up,

12:31.584 --> 12:33.386
it was the kid with the ball.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.055
And where's the "S"
for "straight"?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.389
You don't need to
be represented.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.258
So... they can exclude us,

12:38.291 --> 12:40.560
but when we exclude them,
we're the bad guys?

12:40.593 --> 12:42.462
When exactly do my people
get their justice?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.465
For the last
5,000 years.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.567
Agree to disagree.
JIMMY: You know, this reminds me

12:47.600 --> 12:49.903
of Massachusetts v. Shepherd.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.171
Never heard of it.
Well, it was

12:51.204 --> 12:52.472
a case involving me.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.474
I was at the aquarium
and I got lost.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.343
I end up in the wrong bathroom.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.245
Next thing I know,
I'm getting arrested

12:58.278 --> 13:00.613
for looking like a predator,
which, incidentally,

13:00.647 --> 13:03.316
is why they threw out the case.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.185
They profiled the mustache.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.854
Hmm.
Not a good move.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.255
You should just
sue Barnsdale.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.589
No, I'm not suing anyone, okay?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.825
Suing is how rich white people
solve their problems.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.927
Yeah, but you don't have
to actually sue them.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.263
You could just
threaten to sue them.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.899
I do love threatening.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.838
Hey, Sabrina, I'm so happy
you wanted to come back here.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.974
Yeah, well,
these ribs are delicious.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.376
And... I wanted
to sing and show you

13:29.409 --> 13:31.444
there was nothing
to be afraid of.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.213
Really?
Mm-hmm.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.115
Oh, I'm so
nervous for you.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.117
I want to throw up
and run away.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.987
MAN: All right, next up,
Sabrina Pemberton.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.221
Watch and learn.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.622
Come on up.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.957
(people clapping)

13:43.991 --> 13:46.293
So, how long have you
been in America?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.460
Since I was
12 years old.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.029
Is your family out here?

13:49.062 --> 13:50.463
My family is dead.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.133
Mm.
My mother, she
died of malaria.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.868
So I ran away from home.

13:54.902 --> 13:57.304
Then I was taken and
made to be a soldier.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.639
Huh.
They gave me a gun and
forced me to execute

13:59.672 --> 14:02.575
a farmer, but
my gun jammed.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.544
Thank God you caught a break.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.247
They made me hack him
with a machete instead.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.515
(shudders)

14:08.548 --> 14:10.683
It was my ninth birthday.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.587
Wow. That...

14:14.621 --> 14:17.157
that's just...

14:17.190 --> 14:18.658
perfect.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.894
Do you mind starting
from the top?

14:20.928 --> 14:22.896
Just... Record it
for a friend.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.933
This next song is
for my maid, Alba.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.901
(chuckles)
She's been keeping it real
since I was in diapers.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.170
WOMAN: Yeah, Alba!
Everybody show her some love!
Come on!

14:30.203 --> 14:31.404
You my girl, Alba.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.006
You my girl.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.042
I love you, boo.
Let's do this.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.910
(Notorious B.I.G.'s "Hypnotize"
playing)
Uh. Uh.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.345
Uh.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.913
Come on. Ha.
(whooping)

14:39.947 --> 14:43.516
* Sicka than your average, poppa
twist cabbage off instinct... *

14:43.550 --> 14:45.052
(indistinct chatter)

14:47.554 --> 14:48.688
(grunts)

14:48.721 --> 14:50.090
(grunting)

14:50.123 --> 14:52.359
Easy access, huh?

14:52.392 --> 14:55.195
Mark that down as the school's
first security issue.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.229
Yeah, check.
All right, I'm gonna go

14:56.263 --> 14:57.564
have a chat with that principal.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.766
You stay here and film
anything that looks dangerous.

14:59.799 --> 15:02.635
Safety hazards, violations,
dangerous birds.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.472
Anything you think we could
use as a potential lawsuit.

15:05.505 --> 15:06.473
Okay.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.941
By the time I'm done,

15:07.975 --> 15:09.977
Ben will be prom queen.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.713
(booing)

15:13.746 --> 15:15.082
You got
some nerve

15:15.115 --> 15:17.084
using that word.
Racist!

15:17.117 --> 15:18.385
SABRINA:
How was that racist?

15:18.418 --> 15:19.953
Those are the words of the song.
MAN: Have some respect!

15:19.987 --> 15:22.255
Hey. Where you going?
I thought we were friends.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.723
You don't even know my name.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.225
SABRINA:
Is Mark Twain racist?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.226
Good-bye, Chip.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.495
Good-bye... you.
I mean,

15:28.528 --> 15:31.398
asking me to sanitize
Biggie's art, that's racist.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.233
Yeah, if we didn't buy
Biggie's albums,

15:33.266 --> 15:35.402
then he wouldn't be kicking it
on a yacht right now.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.403
Oh, stop.
(booing)

15:36.436 --> 15:38.972
Shut up, Chip.
You're not helping.

15:39.006 --> 15:43.343
* At last...

15:43.376 --> 15:48.748
* My love has
come along *

15:48.781 --> 15:50.750
(whistling, applause)

15:50.783 --> 15:53.153
WOMAN:
Yeah, Alba!
(whooping)

15:53.186 --> 15:59.259
* My lonely days are over

15:59.292 --> 16:01.094
*
(whooping)

16:01.128 --> 16:06.033
* And life is like a song...

16:06.066 --> 16:08.035
Damn, girl's got pipes.
(applause)

16:08.068 --> 16:10.137
Wow.
MAN: Go, Alba!

16:10.170 --> 16:12.239
* Yeah, yeah...
(whooping, whistling)

16:13.473 --> 16:14.707
Ya!
(screams)

16:14.741 --> 16:16.043
Molested!

16:16.076 --> 16:18.011
(chuckles)
Just kidding.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.546
I will not. But if I did want
to violate you,

16:19.579 --> 16:21.614
there would be no one around
to stop me.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.550
Get out!
Eh, fair enough.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.684
You finish up
this little operation.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.320
I'll meet you in the hallway.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.656
Oh, my God.
(door creaking)

16:30.690 --> 16:33.060
Why are you here?

16:33.093 --> 16:34.794
You no longer have a
child at this school.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.663
It's annoying, right?
And the thing is,

16:36.696 --> 16:39.066
you could have me escorted out,
but you have no security.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.567
And you know what else
you don't have?

16:40.600 --> 16:43.303
Security cameras. Ah!

16:43.336 --> 16:45.405
Ooh! Dark, scary room.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.140
You know what they call that
in prison?

16:47.174 --> 16:48.575
They call that a blind spot.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.677
It's a real good place
to catch a shiv.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.680
Okay. Please stop
kicking doors.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.149
I am simply trying to point
out that my little Beth

16:56.183 --> 16:57.484
is not the problem.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.153
Let's take a walk.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.055
I mean, take a look around
this place.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.324
This school is a
hotbed for predators.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.826
Whoa! Hold on,
who's that guy?

17:06.859 --> 17:08.595
Hey. Little girl.

17:08.628 --> 17:11.231
Hi. Do you feel safe?

17:11.264 --> 17:13.066
Please tell me you know him
and he's a parent

17:13.100 --> 17:14.501
and not
some predator.
Oh, yeah?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.569
I've never seen
that man before.
Pervert!

17:16.603 --> 17:19.239
Predator!
(girls screaming)

17:19.272 --> 17:20.073
Pedophile!

17:20.107 --> 17:22.109
Not again.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.113
What kind of operation
are you running here, lady?

17:26.146 --> 17:27.247
You've just got
Peeping Toms

17:27.280 --> 17:29.182
milling about,
making smut films?

17:29.216 --> 17:31.118
No.
I've got half a
mind to report you.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.520
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.522
Mm-hmm.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.525
There's my guy. Hey,

17:38.558 --> 17:40.093
guess who's back
in Barnsdale.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.262
I'm thinking a five.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.631
I'm not happy there.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.233
What are you talking about?
We love Barnsdale.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.103
Can I go back to my old school?

17:50.137 --> 17:51.238
Really?

17:51.271 --> 17:55.142
I'm sorry
for whatever I was doing wrong.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.376
Oh, buddy.

17:56.409 --> 18:00.280
Hey, you didn't do
anything wrong.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.216
I was the problem, not you.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.752
Can I still wear skirts
and stuff,

18:05.785 --> 18:07.554
or will I get in trouble?

18:07.587 --> 18:10.490
You do whatever you want.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.292
Okay?

18:13.326 --> 18:15.295
I'm sorry.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.435
(humming)

18:22.469 --> 18:23.736
Oh, good.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.738
You're here.
Uh, please, have a seat.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.307
I really would like to
talk to you about Ben.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.341
I sit there.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.677
You've got assigned seats
in here?

18:30.710 --> 18:32.179
Yeah, it's a principal's office.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.447
Hmm. Where I'm from, the
guest gets the good seat.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.349
No, not here.
Okay. It doesn't matter.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.917
Listen, please give Ben
another chance

18:37.950 --> 18:40.453
and take him back.
I'm sorry,
it's too late for that.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.189
I know. I get it.
I owe you an apology.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.157
I certainly owe Ben an apology.

18:44.191 --> 18:48.761
I most likely owe the entire
LGBTQ community an apology.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.198
But I... Please, just
give us another chance.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.600
I'm sorry, but you probably
shouldn't have pulled him out.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.868
I know. I shouldn't have.
I make bad decisions.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.338
I'm a terrible person
and a horrible influence.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.439
I drink,

18:59.472 --> 19:01.308
smoke, lie, steal.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.842
I'm drunk right now.
(chuckles)

19:02.875 --> 19:04.611
I had to take a cab to get here.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.446
And then I had to run away
when it was time to pay,

19:06.479 --> 19:07.514
'cause I didn't have any money.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.948
(sighs)

19:08.981 --> 19:11.184
And I stole this from your desk.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.619
Oh. (sighs)
I... Please.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.355
I'm sorry, okay? I'm awful.
I can't help it.

19:15.388 --> 19:18.291
Yes, you are. Now please leave,
or I'll have to call security.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.527
Security! You've got security.
That's awesome.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.462
That's exactly why Ben needs
to go here.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.498
It's a good school.
And he was happy here.

19:25.532 --> 19:28.501
Just... Please, if you
don't take him back,

19:28.535 --> 19:29.836
I might have to homeschool him.

19:29.869 --> 19:30.903
And I will ruin him.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.505
Please don't let me do that.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.807
All right, fine, fine.
Ben can return to Lockwood.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.376
You cannot.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.378
You got it.
Thank you so much.
Okay. All right.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.879
One last thing,

19:39.912 --> 19:41.814
please cut the kid some slack
on his outfits, okay?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.383
He's gender fluid.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.551
He's what?

19:44.584 --> 19:46.553
He's gender fluid.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.820
You're an educator.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.423
Educate yourself.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.761
(door opens, shuts)

19:54.794 --> 19:58.365
All I'm saying is, I
never yelled a racial slur

19:58.398 --> 19:59.666
at a crowd of people.
I didn't yell it.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.668
I just sang it exactly
like it is in the song.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.437
Well, my Nigerian friend
is pretty torn up over it.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.439
Again, his name is Kingsley.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.275
Look, here comes Mickey.
Let's just keep this

20:08.308 --> 20:10.410
between us, okay?
I want to keep capitalizing

20:10.443 --> 20:11.911
on this Guatemalan thing.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.413
Part of my brand.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.847
Absolutely. Plus, I want
to rub it in her face

20:14.881 --> 20:16.516
that we've
been hanging out.
Oh,

20:16.549 --> 20:19.919
don't worry. I won't mention you
said that word a bunch of times.

20:19.952 --> 20:23.723
Hey, Mickey. Did you know
that the national bird

20:23.756 --> 20:25.358
of Guatemala
is the quetzal?

20:25.392 --> 20:26.926
'Cause I do.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.429
What's Alba's last name?

20:32.064 --> 20:34.066
Hmm.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.804
Really?

20:37.837 --> 20:39.706
I'm sorry. I...

20:39.739 --> 20:41.941
Santiago?
Sanchez?
No.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.044
Um, Smith?
With an "R"? Ra-Ramirez.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.646
It's Ramirez!
Rodriguez!

20:46.679 --> 20:48.281
(birds chirping)

20:48.315 --> 20:50.983
(jackhammering)

20:51.017 --> 20:52.585
What the hell
is that?

20:52.619 --> 20:55.722
Oh. Barnsdale's doubling
the size of their wall

20:55.755 --> 20:57.390
to keep out the creepies.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.426
We done good, Mick.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.430
(jackhammering continues)
(groans)

21:03.463 --> 21:05.432
(truck brake hisses)
(creaking)

21:05.465 --> 21:06.899
(truck beeping)

21:06.933 --> 21:08.901
I mean...

21:08.935 --> 21:11.571
You good with this?

21:11.604 --> 21:13.773
This is crazy.
