A boy of 15
is sentenced to ten years for armed robbery.

01:14.909 --> 01:17.697
The judge sends him to an adult prison...

greeted recording artist Chilli B

a new or previously-owned Mercedes

01:34.226 --> 01:36.468

01:39.650 --> 01:44.278
You'll get a chance to get this rhinestone

01:44.364 --> 01:47.235

01:47.368 --> 01:49.159
The devil knows the wickedness of the city.

01:49.246 --> 01:51.488
He knows he can prey on our ignorance.

01:51.582 --> 01:54.916
He knows he can stoke
unrighteous thoughts in our heads,

01:55.003 --> 01:58.289
and tha the can turn those thoughts
into unrighteous deeds.

02:01.011 --> 02:04.428
Citizens living near Olvera Street
are unhappy this morning

02:04.516 --> 02:09.309

More trouble
for the beleaguered Metro Rail this morning

02:25.752 --> 02:30.498
as angry Beverly Hills residents protest
the newest extension of the Red Line Subway

02:30.592 --> 02:32.419
into their neighborhood.

02:32.511 --> 02:36.462
The demonstration, called outside
the Beverly Centershopping mall...

02:36.558 --> 02:40.343
The people I see here today
never voted for this subway.

02:42.942 --> 02:43.938
And...

02:44.193 --> 02:49.355
And they certainly never voted to see it
stop in the heart of this neighborhood.

02:49.450 --> 02:51.573
Hey, Councilman! Councilman!

02:52.788 --> 02:55.493
The people of your district
want us to clean their houses

02:55.584 --> 02:57.043
and watch their kids.

02:57.127 --> 02:59.036
If we have no cars, how we getting to work?

02:59.130 --> 03:01.419
These buses run every ten minutes.

03:01.508 --> 03:03.880
- How would you know?
- How would I know?

03:03.970 --> 03:07.221
I know this: Every time
this line gets extended there's blasting.

03:07.307 --> 03:10.012
It's dangerous, it's expensive, it's noisy.

03:10.353 --> 03:13.438
Nuke the whole city! Nuke the whole city!

03:18.405 --> 03:20.148
Kelly, your eggs are ready!

03:20.366 --> 03:23.154
Hello? I already told you.
I don't eat in the morning.

03:23.245 --> 03:26.449
The people of my district
have to provide over half the taxes...

03:26.541 --> 03:27.205
Ow!

03:31.715 --> 03:33.542
Max, clean that up.

03:37.389 --> 03:39.596
Kelly, cornflakes are ready.

03:39.684 --> 03:44.146
All the subway's gonna do is make it easier
for downtown's problems to come up west.

03:44.231 --> 03:45.725
What have we got?

03:45.817 --> 03:49.602
Gunshots to the back,
two exit wounds. BP: 80 over, palp.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.357
- Heart rate?
- Heart rate 130.

03:52.325 --> 03:55.077
Get a CBC, chest X-ray and an EKG.

03:56.289 --> 03:57.949
- What have we got?
- Drive-by.

03:58.041 --> 04:01.576
- County full or what?
- Must be some holiday we don't know about.

04:01.671 --> 04:03.414
Ready, 1, 2, 3!

04:03.507 --> 04:05.714
- How many exit wounds?
- Two. Here and here.

04:05.802 --> 04:09.503
- Decreasing respiration and a weak pulse.
- Can I have a number 2 swab?

04:09.598 --> 04:12.932
- Cool watch. Tag or Rolex?
- Rolex. Hubby's big on anniversaries.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.558
Quake!

04:30.417 --> 04:31.697
That was refreshing.

04:31.794 --> 04:33.870
I hate it when that happens.

04:33.964 --> 04:37.084
OK, quake's over.
Let's tube him. Give me a seven.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.506
9.14?

04:39.596 --> 04:41.672
9.14. Right.

04:44.645 --> 04:47.481
Everything all clear?
Folks, I don't know what to say.

04:47.565 --> 04:49.392
OK, you can come out of there now.

04:50.861 --> 04:53.613
Grab a jacket.
We have to go by the office for a while.

04:53.698 --> 04:57.317
- You told Mom you'd take the week off.
- I am taking the week off.

04:57.412 --> 04:59.405
I'll just wait here, OK?

04:59.498 --> 05:04.291
- I can't leave you here after an earthquake.
- Why not? I'm 13. I know what to do.

05:04.379 --> 05:05.624
OK. What do you do?

05:05.714 --> 05:10.128
Get in the door frame, put your head between
your knees and kiss your ass goodbye.

05:11.263 --> 05:13.137
All right. That's it.

05:14.267 --> 05:15.547
Who are you calling?

05:16.729 --> 05:17.642
Anita?

05:17.730 --> 05:20.518
- Dad!
- Shut up. I need a baby-sitter.

05:20.609 --> 05:22.566
...not to panic. Please stay calm.

05:23.780 --> 05:27.825
Damage from
this morning's shaker, time dat 9.14am,

05:27.910 --> 05:31.955
seems to be confined
offender-benders and jangled nerves...

05:32.041 --> 05:36.953
We have a non-injury accident,
7th and Stanley. Altercation reported.

05:40.051 --> 05:42.542
Oh-oh, we're cool now. It's the LAPD.

05:42.638 --> 05:46.173
Officer! How about
giving us a ride back to civilization?

05:46.268 --> 05:49.435
What's up?
You gonna come out or what? It's our 'hood.

05:49.522 --> 05:51.182
You wanna tell me what this is about?

05:51.275 --> 05:54.276
- Get outta my face.
- If I'm in your face, you'd know it, bro!

05:54.362 --> 05:55.311
Huh, right!

05:55.405 --> 05:58.323
No official word
on the quake's magnitude...

05:58.409 --> 06:01.613
- Have we got any power failure?
- Blue Line running.

06:01.705 --> 06:04.872
- What's the status on Green Line?
- Green Line good.

06:04.959 --> 06:08.744
- We got radio contact with the train.
- Radio up and running on Blue.

06:08.839 --> 06:11.330
OK, let's get some business done.

06:12.052 --> 06:15.303
Epicenter and magnitude?
Who's in for a ten spot?

06:19.020 --> 06:21.428
Vegas, 6.8.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.774
Vegas. I love that.

06:26.154 --> 06:31.150
...we hope to get confirmation of
the shaker's magnitude from seismologists.

06:31.244 --> 06:32.738
I can't.

06:32.830 --> 06:33.612
I can't.

06:33.706 --> 06:36.078
A couple of sentences, a question or two.

06:36.167 --> 06:37.198
Why don't you do it?

06:37.294 --> 06:40.960
People wanna hear from a seismologist,
not a pencil pusher.

06:41.049 --> 06:43.042
If I go out there, I'm gonna throw up.

06:43.135 --> 06:46.172
That won't send
the sense of calm we're looking for.

06:46.264 --> 06:51.057
- Hey, you guys feel anything this morning?
- You're off the hook, Flash.

06:52.814 --> 06:55.650
You weren't gonna
make her talk to those nasty reporters?

06:55.735 --> 06:58.226
I got some stuff I wanna show you later.

06:58.322 --> 06:59.021
OK.

07:01.826 --> 07:04.400
Good morning, good morning.
How are you?

07:04.497 --> 07:05.991
Hi, Amy.

07:06.082 --> 07:08.752
- Morning, Doc.
- All righty. You ready?

07:08.836 --> 07:10.579
You're on air.

07:10.671 --> 07:14.752
This was a small-to-moderate earthquake,
epicenter in Palmdale...

07:14.844 --> 07:16.469
Palmdale! Ah!

07:16.554 --> 07:19.259
- Who's got it?
- Gobby's got it!

07:19.350 --> 07:20.595
Gobby's the winner.

07:20.685 --> 07:21.965
Yeah!

07:22.061 --> 07:23.721
Get outta here!

07:23.814 --> 07:28.228
...there could be aftershocks that
- Get back to work. Think this is a party?

07:28.320 --> 07:31.772
Could potentially
reach the range we felt this morning.

07:31.866 --> 07:35.911
- As you have heard, it was a 4.9.
- Yes, baby, you can go to work

07:35.997 --> 07:38.833
because the building's been retrofitted.

07:38.917 --> 07:42.583
- It's my job to know that, sweetheart.
- Hello, Emmit. Hello, feet.

07:42.672 --> 07:47.086
It is so you to blow a vacation day
for a little tremor. What are you doing here?

07:47.178 --> 07:50.263
- Vacation means you don't come in.
- Roark, your ex-wife called.

07:50.349 --> 07:53.849
If a dam breaks, the Mayor calls,
I don't want you saying I'm fishing.

07:53.937 --> 07:58.232
Mayor's in Aspen.
We don't pull her off the slopes for only a 4.9.

07:58.318 --> 08:01.735
- Besides, I'd cover for you.
- Yeah, you look comfortable at my desk.

08:01.822 --> 08:03.945
Yeah, it was like I belonged there.

08:04.868 --> 08:06.659
I thought he had the week off.

08:06.746 --> 08:08.786
Yeah, it's that Midwestern work ethic.

08:08.873 --> 08:10.949
Oh, what is that? What is that?

08:11.043 --> 08:13.997
- Water main...
... ruptured. Gas is gone, too. I sent crews out.

08:14.089 --> 08:17.459
Other than that,
the phone and power lines are all up.

08:18.553 --> 08:19.335
Thank you.

08:21.223 --> 08:22.765
Gotta be fast, fast, fast.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.638
- Look, watch. You see that..?
- Yeah, I've got...

08:25.729 --> 08:27.722
That man loves to hover.

08:29.067 --> 08:30.775
Yeah, like you don't!

08:31.320 --> 08:35.365
Seismologists are saying today's
quake may have revealed a new fault system

08:35.450 --> 08:40.279
- not previously thought to be active.
- I don't care what your supervisor said!

08:40.373 --> 08:45.416
Nobody ran a work order past me
and this vehicle is on public property!

08:45.505 --> 08:47.913
- You gonna ticket us?
- You're the cute one.

08:48.009 --> 08:50.631
How 'bout I tow your ass, honey?

08:55.143 --> 08:56.685
Jesus! Get an ambulance!

08:56.812 --> 08:58.390
Quickly!

08:58.481 --> 09:00.141
- What the hell happened?
- Ohhh!

09:00.275 --> 09:04.439
- Gently, gently!
- Help's coming. Where's Danny?

09:04.530 --> 09:07.900
Danny! Danny? Where are the others?

09:09.370 --> 09:10.829
They burnt up...

09:11.707 --> 09:13.367
Hot...

09:20.051 --> 09:22.044
A code 6 from Public Works.

09:22.137 --> 09:25.720
MacArthur Park. Possible fire or explosion.
Casualties reported.

09:25.850 --> 09:31.724
Word is coming in of a possible
gas explosion in the MacArthur Park area.

09:31.858 --> 09:36.486
We don't have any details as yet
as to the precise nature or size of the blast,

09:36.615 --> 09:41.658
which is said to have injured
a number of city workers, some seriously.

09:41.788 --> 09:45.240
- Rescue crews are responding at the site...
- Oh, God.

09:46.294 --> 09:50.293
- What are you doing here?
- Got a call. Said Public Works lost 7 guys.

09:50.383 --> 09:54.428
Freak accident on a storm drain job.
They hit a steam pocket and got scalded.

09:54.513 --> 09:59.306
No fires, no explosions, no continuing threat.
We'll copy you on a report.

09:59.395 --> 10:00.557
Steam did that?

10:01.481 --> 10:02.311
Yeah.

10:02.399 --> 10:03.858
Where's the survivor?

10:03.942 --> 10:07.857
He's at Saint V's right now.
Critical, last time I checked,

10:07.948 --> 10:13.192
but I'd like to notify the families before they
hear about it on Geraldo, if you don't mind.

10:16.292 --> 10:18.166
Mind if I have a look for myself?

10:18.253 --> 10:21.124
Roark... we'll copy.

10:21.215 --> 10:23.504
- Mike! Mike!
- OK?

10:26.639 --> 10:30.340
Stan! Get over here.
I wanna show you something.

10:30.436 --> 10:32.974
How's the choo-choo behaving?

10:34.858 --> 10:37.812
All right. This is where your problem is.

10:37.904 --> 10:38.734
Was.

10:39.740 --> 10:43.026
This... is your Red Line tunnel.

10:43.119 --> 10:43.735
OK.

10:43.829 --> 10:47.993
What I wanna do is shut down this section
just as a precaution until we know.

10:48.084 --> 10:50.658
Why should we look bad
because DWP blew some pipes out?

10:50.754 --> 10:53.755
Nothing blew down there, Olber.
They hit a steam pocket.

10:53.842 --> 10:55.669
- Steam?
- Yeah.

10:55.761 --> 10:58.549
The tunnel walls are five feet of concrete.
Where's the threat to my trains?

11:01.268 --> 11:02.347
Mine.

11:02.437 --> 11:06.020
- Can we wrap this up?
- Maybe the earthquake tore something out.

11:06.108 --> 11:08.101
- Shit.
- Let's find out before we...

11:08.194 --> 11:10.946
You're only happy declaring an emergency!

11:11.031 --> 11:15.694
No, I actually enjoy motor sports, music
and the company of close friends... sir.

11:15.788 --> 11:20.831
30,000 people think they're taking the train
home tonight. What am I supposed to do?

11:20.919 --> 11:23.671
Put on extra buses.

11:23.757 --> 11:26.711
It's his mess. Let him take the shit for it.

11:29.598 --> 11:33.050
...all around me
I can see rescue workers and body bags.

11:33.144 --> 11:38.388
This is an awful tragedy for the families of
the workers who perished here this morning.

11:38.484 --> 11:41.485
...intersection of7th and Alvarado.

11:41.572 --> 11:44.146
Bodies are spread across the sidewalks.

11:44.242 --> 11:48.371
We're told one worker did survive,
but his identity has not been released yet.

11:48.456 --> 11:53.333
- 170 over 105.
- Let's give him some more morphine.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.043
- Start another line of ringers.
- Let's cut away his burnt clothing.

11:56.133 --> 12:00.713
Fran, look.
Steam doesn't char clothing like this.

12:00.806 --> 12:02.265
This is a flame burn.

12:02.349 --> 12:03.345
Methane?

12:03.434 --> 12:05.059
No.

12:09.442 --> 12:10.722
Something else.

12:12.112 --> 12:14.782
The trouble was not caused by steam,

12:14.866 --> 12:20.538
which, if you'll recall from our briefing
this morning, was our position all along.

12:22.668 --> 12:27.082
This is such a bad idea, Mike.
This isn't OEM. This is DWP's show.

12:27.174 --> 12:30.591
- I wanna know what's in that hole.
- Let Public Works send a crew in.

12:30.678 --> 12:33.252
I can't wait three days for a report.
Can you, Gator?

12:33.349 --> 12:35.721
- Hell, no.
- OK, let's go.

12:35.810 --> 12:37.933
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

12:38.022 --> 12:39.600
7, 8, 9

12:39.690 --> 12:42.976
I'm the one that praised the land...

12:52.040 --> 12:56.537
This is Emmit Reese.
Emmit Reese to Ground Control.

12:56.629 --> 12:58.004
Los Angeles, do you copy?

12:58.090 --> 13:01.376
Yeah, we copy. It's hot as hell down here.

13:03.430 --> 13:04.426
You all right?

13:05.433 --> 13:08.767
Great!
Is it too late to switch jobs with Emmit?

13:08.854 --> 13:12.805
He doesn't want your job.
He wants mine, Gator.

13:12.901 --> 13:15.819
Yes, and a company car, Mike.
Don't forget that.

13:22.622 --> 13:25.078
- OK, we're coming up... Whoa!
- Look at that. A rat!

13:26.335 --> 13:29.171
OK, we're coming up on the storm drain now.

13:34.513 --> 13:37.598
This is where those guys died.
Seven guys right here.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.593
Must have died in a hurry.

13:40.646 --> 13:42.188
Let's have a look.

13:43.191 --> 13:45.184
Go on.

14:07.140 --> 14:11.091
- Emmit Reese.
- Roark! Roark, is that you? Roark!

14:11.270 --> 14:15.019
- Mike, it's Chief Sindelar on the line.
- Take a message.

14:15.108 --> 14:16.768
You want me to tell the Chief of Police

14:16.861 --> 14:18.141
I gotta take a message?

14:18.238 --> 14:23.031
Yeah.
Tell him, uh... I'm slightly busy right now.

14:23.119 --> 14:25.693
That's the issue he wants to discuss with you.

14:25.789 --> 14:29.159
What's he doing!
Public Works is sending a crew in.

14:29.252 --> 14:31.660
Those guys are idiots. He knows that.

14:31.755 --> 14:34.626
Mike felt this was too time-sensitive to wait.

14:34.718 --> 14:37.922
Tell him we've got procedures.
He's not in Kansas anymore!

14:38.014 --> 14:42.013
- You're not in Kansas anymore, Michael.
- St Louis. I'm not in St Louis.

14:42.103 --> 14:45.888
- St Louis. He's not in St Louis.
- I don't give a shit where he's not!

14:45.983 --> 14:50.147
- He has a desk now! That's where he works!
- You have a desk. That's where you work.

14:53.785 --> 14:55.825
Got a reading here.

15:01.253 --> 15:02.961
There is a steam vent.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.794
Water and Power had it right.

15:06.885 --> 15:09.803
Steam's coming up
through a crack in the concrete.

15:09.889 --> 15:12.214
Tremendous heat!

15:18.401 --> 15:19.599
Aftershock!?

15:20.946 --> 15:24.565
No. Subway. We're right up against it.

15:24.659 --> 15:26.118
- Mike?
- What's going on?

15:26.203 --> 15:27.828
Hold on one minute, sir. Mike!

15:29.874 --> 15:31.783
Wait a minute. I can't hear you.

15:32.711 --> 15:34.538
Mike, I lost you. You there?

15:36.967 --> 15:39.637
Look at those rats! They're cooked!

15:40.722 --> 15:42.513
Damn, Gator! I'm cooked, too.

15:44.727 --> 15:47.894
So are you. Emmit, this is no good.
Let's get outta here!

16:06.005 --> 16:07.998
What the hell's going on?

16:08.091 --> 16:09.253
Hah! Shit!

16:10.011 --> 16:13.096
Get LAPD to clear everybody
out of this park. You all right?

16:13.682 --> 16:16.968
Call Olber
before we lose a coupla trains down there.

16:17.062 --> 16:19.600
Close off everything in this sector, gas lines...

16:19.690 --> 16:21.433
Mike, what's going on?

16:21.526 --> 16:25.026
Big jet of gas coming up outta that tube.
Sparks, hot as hell.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.193
He ain't lying.

16:26.282 --> 16:29.983
Find me a scientist! Somebody
that can tell me what the hell is going on!

16:30.079 --> 16:31.110
Got it.

16:48.979 --> 16:52.764
Situated on Wilshire Boulevard's
famous Museum Row,

16:52.859 --> 16:57.522
the La Brea Tar Pits are one of the
LA Basin's most active geological features.

16:57.615 --> 17:02.029
Here for the past 40,000 years
a deep fissure in the Earth's crust

17:02.121 --> 17:07.579
has allowed oily tar and methane to bubble
up to the surface from far underground.

17:07.670 --> 17:12.333
Evidence of the ceaseless activity
below our very feet.

17:12.886 --> 17:17.300
The 22-storey Beverly Heights
apartment building will open on schedule

17:17.391 --> 17:19.348
in spite of construction delays.

17:19.435 --> 17:22.307
That's the word
from developer Norman Calder.

17:22.397 --> 17:27.819
Many see the new land mark tower
as a sign the LA economy's on the rebound.

17:27.905 --> 17:31.109
Now here's Jere Laird
with the rest of the business news.

17:38.419 --> 17:40.791
Wow.

17:40.881 --> 17:42.624
So?

17:44.594 --> 17:46.551
I think I married a genius.

17:46.639 --> 17:50.258
Three years, four banks, $100 million,

17:50.352 --> 17:52.594
but the doors are open.

17:55.650 --> 17:58.355
I am so proud of you, honey.

17:58.446 --> 17:59.821
You never gave up.

18:00.490 --> 18:01.652
You didn't let me.

18:02.660 --> 18:04.653
Here's how I see our future.

18:04.746 --> 18:09.160
We move into this penthouse,
and then you transfer to Cedars,

18:09.252 --> 18:12.253
which is right down the block.

18:12.339 --> 18:13.121
Norman...

18:13.215 --> 18:17.759
I don't want my wife treating gunshot
wounds. I want her treating tennis elbows.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.175
Right. Finished?

18:19.265 --> 18:22.931
Hardly. This is only the beginning.

18:26.566 --> 18:30.730
- I can't believe he got a baby-sitter.
- Yeah, well, I'm doing him a favor.

18:30.822 --> 18:32.898
A big favor. I'm gonna miss my class.

18:40.794 --> 18:41.992
Hello?

18:42.087 --> 18:43.498
Mike!

18:44.215 --> 18:49.459
Oh, fine. A perfect little ray of sunshine
like I was after my parents separated.

18:49.555 --> 18:53.885
Every couple of minutes her head comes
off her shoulders, rotates 360 degrees,

18:53.978 --> 18:56.101
then she starts watching TV again.

19:01.196 --> 19:02.394
It's been hours.

19:02.489 --> 19:05.989
Well, we've got a situation here.
I'll come home as soon as I can.

19:06.077 --> 19:08.865
We'll go to OJ's house,
then the Beverly Center, right?

19:08.956 --> 19:13.037
- I thought we said Disneyland.
- We talked about getting my nose pierced.

19:13.128 --> 19:15.287
Not in this life, baby.

19:16.007 --> 19:18.047
I'll be home soon. What can I do for you?

19:18.135 --> 19:23.842
- I'm getting my nose pierced.
- It's a nice look, especially when you sneeze.

19:23.934 --> 19:24.883
You can't do this!

19:24.977 --> 19:29.605
What?! You're talking about 10,000 customers
with no cooking and no heat.

19:29.692 --> 19:31.815
- Gas will be restored once it's safe.
- When?

19:31.903 --> 19:34.525
You're talking about
sending a crew to every house

19:34.615 --> 19:38.198
to turn on every damn pilot.
This could take weeks, if not more.

19:38.286 --> 19:40.611
Excuse me just one second, please.

19:40.706 --> 19:43.542
- Having fun yet?
- I'm starting to miss the Mississippi.

19:43.627 --> 19:47.210
- The mud, floods?
- Mike, you have a call on your private line.

19:47.298 --> 19:50.549
That'll be my girl wanting a tattoo.
Help me with this guy.

19:50.636 --> 19:53.756
- How you doing? Oh, Wendy.
- Why did you leave Kelly alone?

19:53.849 --> 19:57.349
- Pulling one of your usual stunts.
- What? It was an earthquake.

19:57.437 --> 20:00.688
- She hates earthquakes. She's only 13.
- Nobody likes an earthquake.

20:00.775 --> 20:04.192
- She's been alone...
- She has not. I left her with a baby-sitter.

20:04.279 --> 20:05.477
- Who?
- A neighbor.

20:05.573 --> 20:08.824
How's she supposed to know
what to do if there's another earthquake?

20:08.910 --> 20:11.911
- Kelly knows what to do...
- You never change, Mike.

20:11.998 --> 20:14.406
Hello? Hello?

20:18.840 --> 20:20.120
Phone went dead.

20:20.217 --> 20:25.260
Yeah, they been doing that all over the city.
I'll get a crew out right away.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.884
Why not do more underground blasting
to see if there's a fault line?

20:28.979 --> 20:30.936
- No, let's do it your way.
- My way?

20:31.023 --> 20:35.022
- We'll empty every building over two storys.
- God, you're a geek.

20:35.112 --> 20:36.939
- Mike, Emmit.
- You're a geek.

20:37.031 --> 20:38.656
Nice shirt, Stan.

20:39.659 --> 20:41.153
You Roark? Amy Barnes.

20:41.245 --> 20:44.081
- Hi.
- I'm from CIGS. Nice to meet you.

20:44.165 --> 20:47.700
Careful not to disagree
with anything Dr. Barnes says.

20:47.795 --> 20:51.663
Would you give it a rest? All we said was
Cahuenga was geologically unstable.

20:51.759 --> 20:55.045
- The whole city is.
- That's why we don't want tunnels blown up.

20:55.138 --> 20:58.555
Thanks for coming on short notice,
but save the fight for later.

20:58.643 --> 21:00.600
Sure. Two o'clock good for you?

21:02.815 --> 21:04.724
- Huh?
- Go ahead. Encourage her.

21:06.737 --> 21:09.573
Dr. Barnes, can you tell me
what's under MacArthur Park?

21:09.657 --> 21:11.235
Not with any certainty, no,

21:11.326 --> 21:13.366
- That's a shock.
- But I...

21:13.454 --> 21:16.028
We ran trains through all day. No incidents.

21:16.124 --> 21:20.917
This analysis from the guys
who collapsed Hollywood Boulevard.

21:21.006 --> 21:25.135
My engineers were there - no demonstrable
risk. You got conflicting evidence?

21:25.220 --> 21:28.091
Some reason to strand passengers?
I'm all ears.

21:28.182 --> 21:30.934
Until then, we stay on schedule.

21:31.019 --> 21:32.893
I'm sorry, Mike.

21:34.315 --> 21:36.058
Oh, lah!

21:36.151 --> 21:37.894
He's gotta change his nicotine patch.

21:40.907 --> 21:42.022
- So?
- So.

21:43.577 --> 21:48.536
So? How do I find out
what's underneath MacArthur Park?

21:48.626 --> 21:51.200
...low-grade evacuation of MacArthur Park.

21:51.296 --> 21:55.425
City officials won't say if
it has anything to do with the deaths today

21:55.510 --> 21:57.301
of those seven public workers.

21:58.889 --> 22:02.259
Take a look at this.

22:02.352 --> 22:04.392
OK. Um, what am I looking at?

22:05.940 --> 22:08.894
That lake was 62 degrees yesterday.
Today it's up to 68.

22:08.986 --> 22:11.691
- Yeah, it's a sunny day.
- It is lovely, isn't it?

22:12.574 --> 22:17.700
It takes a geological event to heat a million
gallons of water by six degrees in 12 hours.

22:17.789 --> 22:19.367
What is a geological event?

22:20.543 --> 22:24.707
I'm sure you're aware of this,
that our continents sit on tectonic plates.

22:24.799 --> 22:27.635
- Great big rafts on an ocean of molten rock.
- Yeah.

22:27.719 --> 22:32.049
When they shift, like they did this morning,
we get an earthquake. OK?

22:32.142 --> 22:34.182
Yeah.

22:34.269 --> 22:38.137
Same mechanism
can sometimes open a fissure, sometimes.

22:38.233 --> 22:43.062
Magma can find
one of those fissures and rise up through it.

22:43.156 --> 22:44.105
What's magma?

22:44.199 --> 22:47.651
- Lava.
- Lava? Uh, here in LA?

22:48.747 --> 22:50.372
It's one of several possibilities.

22:51.459 --> 22:53.784
It is unlikely, but it is a possibility.

22:53.879 --> 22:56.370
We have a history of that
in the downtown area?

22:56.466 --> 23:01.710
Paracutin, 1943, a Mexican farmer
sees smoke coming out of his cornfield.

23:01.806 --> 23:04.642
A week later there was a volcano 1,000ft high.

23:04.726 --> 23:08.261
There's no history of anything
until it happens, then there is.

23:09.733 --> 23:10.978
Well, thanks, ladies.

23:11.068 --> 23:12.895
Um,

23:12.987 --> 23:14.861
enjoy your day in the park.

23:16.575 --> 23:20.620
- Ooh, yeah, that was subtle.
- What? You want me to humor him?

23:20.706 --> 23:23.957
He asked us for a hypothesis.
You have a better one?

23:24.044 --> 23:25.419
It's lava.

23:25.504 --> 23:26.619
Lava, hm.

23:26.714 --> 23:29.751
Hey, hey, that's me!
My God, I'm gonna call my mom.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.168
- Uh-huh.
- I'm on the TV, man!

23:33.640 --> 23:34.505
Excuse me.

23:34.599 --> 23:36.675
You invited us, remember?

23:36.769 --> 23:40.435
You want me to call Olber
and tell him the demonstrable risk is lava?

23:40.524 --> 23:43.976
- Just give me time to do my work.
- Cos a lake went up a few degrees?!

23:44.070 --> 23:47.487
No, because seven men baked to death
and nobody knows why.

23:47.575 --> 23:49.449
MTA does not answer to the city.

23:49.536 --> 23:52.906
I cannot go to the mat with them
unless you know something.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.410
I do know something,

23:54.501 --> 23:56.244
just not with any certainty.

23:57.630 --> 23:59.089
Is that the company line?

23:59.174 --> 24:01.630
I'm a scientist. Certainty is a big word.

24:01.719 --> 24:05.552
I need time to collect my data.
I've gotta get down there and get samples.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.383
- I can't let you do that.
- Why not?

24:07.476 --> 24:09.552
It is too dangerous.

24:09.646 --> 24:10.725
That's why.

24:11.523 --> 24:13.599
I'm sorry.

24:21.745 --> 24:23.073
Shit.

24:23.164 --> 24:24.195
What did he say?

24:24.290 --> 24:27.244
Oh, it's too dangerous.

24:27.336 --> 24:30.955
It's man's work and you're girlies.
I can't let you go down there.

24:31.049 --> 24:33.374
- He likes you. I can tell.
- He's OK.

24:33.469 --> 24:38.927
In a macho, controlling, "suspicious of
anyone not from his home town" kinda way.

24:39.018 --> 24:41.094
So you like him. This is good.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.642
We've got to go down there.

24:44.734 --> 24:47.735
I don't see how we can.
This place is swarming with cops.

24:47.821 --> 24:48.852
Yeah.

24:48.990 --> 24:52.276
Let's do it in the morning
before the cops come on duty.

24:52.369 --> 24:54.741
All right. I'll pick you up at four.

24:54.831 --> 24:57.785
Four it is. Bring coffee. What have you got?

24:57.876 --> 24:59.952
More harmonic tremors.

25:25.454 --> 25:27.992
Good morning. It'sjustafter5.10.

25:28.083 --> 25:30.954
Didn't take long
to get our first alert this morning.

25:31.045 --> 25:36.420
A jack-knifed truck on the westbound side
of the 10 is spreading tomatoes everywhere.

25:36.511 --> 25:37.756
One lane open...

26:18.441 --> 26:20.315
Wow.

26:21.570 --> 26:24.061
Earthlings, we come in peace.

26:26.869 --> 26:30.535
God, these suits weigh a ton.
I feel like I'm wearing a car.

26:30.624 --> 26:32.083
Hey, look at this.

26:32.168 --> 26:34.327
- What's that?
- Looks like sulphur.

26:34.421 --> 26:36.877
I can't smell it.

26:36.966 --> 26:40.917
- Ah, shit! My flashlight's going out.
- It's everywhere.

26:41.013 --> 26:44.014
Could be traces of magnesium, nickel.
What d'you think?

26:44.100 --> 26:46.508
Take some samples. That's how we'll find out.

26:46.604 --> 26:49.605
My battery's dead. Hold on a sec.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.351
Hey?

26:54.322 --> 26:56.445
What? What you got?

26:59.829 --> 27:02.367
I don't know.

27:44.222 --> 27:46.298
Daddy!

27:47.267 --> 27:48.180
Kelly, baby!

27:48.269 --> 27:49.300
Kelly!

27:51.648 --> 27:52.679
Dad!

27:53.734 --> 27:55.810
Hang on, baby!

27:56.446 --> 27:59.566
Come on, sweetie.
Back! Get under the door frame.

28:02.996 --> 28:04.027
Oh, God!

28:21.354 --> 28:21.934
Rachel?

28:23.315 --> 28:25.391
Amy! Argh!

28:26.694 --> 28:29.185
Help! I've got...

28:29.281 --> 28:31.155
Amy! Amy!

28:31.242 --> 28:32.570
Rachel!

28:32.661 --> 28:34.239
Give me your hand!

28:35.957 --> 28:38.413
- Oh, God. Come on!
- Help!

28:40.463 --> 28:43.381
- Someone help me!
- I'm burning up!

28:43.467 --> 28:46.718
I'm burning up! My legs are burning!

28:46.804 --> 28:48.346
Hold on, Rachel!

29:13.924 --> 29:16.000
Oh, b...

29:17.512 --> 29:20.134
How 'bout that wake-up call, everybody?

29:20.224 --> 29:23.012
OK, we have phone lines. Phone lines are up.

29:23.103 --> 29:24.894
Generator's switching.

29:26.774 --> 29:29.479
Emergency power's up.
What you got coming in, Phil?

29:29.569 --> 29:31.194
I got...

29:31.280 --> 29:34.234
- Katie, DWP?
- DWP - I'm doing that right now.

29:34.326 --> 29:37.493
- Anybody seen Billy?
- He's stuck on the 10. He's not in yet.

29:44.297 --> 29:45.577
Listen up, people.

29:45.674 --> 29:49.091
I want a meeting of all department heads
in exactly five minutes.

29:49.179 --> 29:50.970
That's a very cool hat, Emmit.

29:51.056 --> 29:55.101
Thanks. Your wife rolled over
and said the same thing to me this morning.

29:55.187 --> 29:57.096
- Hello.
- That's a pink slip.

29:57.189 --> 29:59.396
Any more quips, or can we work this thing?

29:59.609 --> 30:03.654
Like you, we here at the Channel 10
newsroom felt that big jolt this morning.

30:03.740 --> 30:05.649
It was a powerful earthquake.

30:05.742 --> 30:09.277
We're having trouble
contacting emergency officials...

30:09.372 --> 30:11.910
Put your seat belt on, honey. Remember?

30:16.924 --> 30:19.878
That's OK, baby. There you go.

30:22.014 --> 30:24.588
I wanna go home.

30:24.684 --> 30:27.555
We're going to
the safest room in town, I promise.

30:28.689 --> 30:30.432
- Operations.
- Yes, this is Roark.

30:30.525 --> 30:32.434
- Got Roark, line one.
- Got him.

30:32.528 --> 30:37.357
Mike, listen. There's no reports of damage yet
to any hospitals, but 911 is off the hook.

30:37.451 --> 30:42.031
- ATSAC's reporting all freeways are clear.
- We got good news. All freeways are clear.

30:42.124 --> 30:44.247
I want you to get all helicopters up now.

30:44.335 --> 30:47.502
Bob, we need pictures.
I need those choppers in the air now.

30:47.589 --> 30:51.006
I'm heading east on Wilshire.
We're coming up on the Tar Pits.

30:51.094 --> 30:54.879
Poles are all up, but there's no light.
A lotta haze here.

30:54.974 --> 30:56.765
Let me in there, Brian.

30:56.852 --> 31:01.266
Yeah, looks like
power's down everywhere in the city.

31:01.358 --> 31:02.852
How'd you get in so fast?

31:02.943 --> 31:05.517
Get in? Come on, Boss,
you know I sleep on your desk.

31:05.613 --> 31:06.988
Disaster is my life.

31:09.577 --> 31:11.570
He's kidding, right?

31:11.663 --> 31:17.370
It's too early to hear from
the California Institute of Geological Studies...

31:20.925 --> 31:22.004
Dad!

31:24.263 --> 31:25.757
Hold it. Wh-what was that?

31:27.768 --> 31:29.844
That something on your end, Mike?

31:36.446 --> 31:38.818
- Mike, come in. What's going on?
- I got Burbank up.

31:44.415 --> 31:46.206
Daddy, what is this?

31:46.292 --> 31:47.572
I don't know, baby.

31:47.669 --> 31:48.582
Argh!

32:03.440 --> 32:04.222
Mike, come on!

32:39.905 --> 32:42.823
- We're gonna die!
- No, we're not. I need both hands!

32:42.909 --> 32:46.824
Emmit, what's the nearest fire station
to Wilshire and Stanley?

32:46.914 --> 32:48.373
What you looking at, Mike?

32:49.376 --> 32:51.701
Mike? Mike, come in. What's going on?

32:52.296 --> 32:54.966
Fire! Heavy! Underground and structural!

32:55.050 --> 33:00.046
There's smoke coming from the Tar Pits
and something like meteors coming out.

33:00.140 --> 33:01.848
Sounded like you said "meteors"?

33:01.934 --> 33:03.049
Look out!

33:04.270 --> 33:07.853
There's bombs. Emmit,
get hold of that geologist, Amy Barnes.

33:09.653 --> 33:11.693
- You have Amy Barnes, Katie?
- Check again.

33:11.780 --> 33:15.529
- No.
- We're looking. Nobody knows where she is.

33:32.433 --> 33:34.260
Goddammit!

34:05.184 --> 34:08.684
- Where are we?
- Power failure on all the lines.

34:08.772 --> 34:10.848
Contact with the trains?

34:10.942 --> 34:13.231
All but one. I think we got a problem.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.737
Number four train westbound
on the Red Line at MacArthur Park.

34:16.824 --> 34:20.195
Temperature on board
reached 20 degrees above normal.

34:20.288 --> 34:22.161
It's still going up.

34:28.966 --> 34:30.875
What d'you wanna do, Stan?

34:32.721 --> 34:36.221
I'm going down there. Get a team together.

34:46.572 --> 34:49.824
- What happened?
- Is everybody OK in here?

34:49.909 --> 34:53.860
- How you doin'? What's happening?
- Fine. I think we had an earthquake.

34:53.956 --> 34:55.119
- Earthquake?
- Yeah. You OK?

34:55.208 --> 34:57.249
- What's causing the heat?
- I don't know.

34:57.337 --> 35:01.965
- Hey, I'll help you.
- No. Stay where you are. Nobody move.

35:02.051 --> 35:03.794
Why is it so hot in here?

35:03.887 --> 35:06.129
- I'll try and open a door.
- I cannot breathe.

35:11.272 --> 35:15.401
The damage is pretty widespread.
A number of fires are breaking out...

35:15.486 --> 35:18.274
Refinery info's coming in. I got Marty on that.

35:18.365 --> 35:22.743
Hyperion's got no damage.
We're still waiting on Tillman Reclamation.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.572
Call DWP and stay on it.

35:24.665 --> 35:26.243
Yes, Chief?

35:26.334 --> 35:27.876
- Roark!
- No, Reese, sir.

35:27.961 --> 35:30.120
- Where's Roark?
- He's on his way.

35:30.214 --> 35:33.880
Gonna be delayed. My car's stuck
behind my gate cos we have no damn power!

35:33.969 --> 35:37.421
Yeah, I got it. "No damn power".
Very good. Reese out.

35:38.558 --> 35:39.554
Jerk.

35:41.812 --> 35:47.899
- Lisa, get me a bottle and a half of aspirin...
- Staff is caught in traffic due to the quake.

35:48.488 --> 35:51.525
This is KNX, continuing
our live coverage of today's quake.

35:51.617 --> 35:54.535
A situation's developing in Wilshire.

35:54.621 --> 35:58.370
Our Bob Davis is there now,
reporting from his car. Bob?

35:58.459 --> 36:02.410
Mitch, I'm approaching the scene now.
There's ash falling everywhere,

36:02.506 --> 36:04.582
almost looks like a grey snow.

36:04.676 --> 36:07.630
Several buildings are burning out of control.

36:07.722 --> 36:11.721
It began a few minutes after the quake,
started by an undetermined source.

36:11.810 --> 36:15.144
There was an explosion,
breaking windows, then flames.

36:15.232 --> 36:18.150
Bob, could it be a ruptured gas line?

36:18.236 --> 36:23.195
No. It sounded like something
just slammed into one of the buildings.

36:37.887 --> 36:41.007
Calm down.
The fire department's on its way.

36:41.099 --> 36:43.388
Put some pressure on that right away.

36:43.477 --> 36:45.386
Emmit! It's a mess here. Can you hear me?

36:45.480 --> 36:50.190
I need a traffic perimeter for three blocks
in every direction round Wilshire and Stanley.

36:50.278 --> 36:51.357
OK, I'm on it, Mike.

36:51.446 --> 36:56.904
17 is down. 17's engine is down.
Wilshire and Curzon. Wilshire and Curzon.

36:56.995 --> 37:01.824
...several outbreaks of looting
following this morning's strong quake.

37:01.918 --> 37:08.124
These pictures just coming in to the Channel
10 newsroom verify the looting is going on.

37:08.218 --> 37:13.759
We are now hearing that the National Guard
has been activated and is on its way to LA...

38:00.287 --> 38:02.196
Stay with me. You still with me?

38:02.290 --> 38:03.570
It's gonna be OK.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.790
We've got help on the way.

38:05.878 --> 38:08.452
Don't move, sweetheart. You'll be safe here.

38:08.548 --> 38:12.131
- You're leaving me here?
- No, just going over there.

38:12.220 --> 38:15.839
I'll be right back.
You'll be able to see me the whole time.

38:15.933 --> 38:19.184
If you get scared,
you honk that horn, OK?

38:24.403 --> 38:28.733
- Mitch, I'm at the Tar Pits...
- Get outta here!

38:28.825 --> 38:30.652
- Don't touch that man!
- Watch out!

38:30.744 --> 38:34.114
Don't touch that man, ma'am.
The ambulances are on their way.

38:34.207 --> 38:38.669
I'm a doctor. He has a skull fracture.
The other man has a compound structure.

38:38.755 --> 38:40.463
Can you get him off the street

38:40.549 --> 38:44.334
and see if there's anything
in that fire truck we could use as a splint.

38:44.429 --> 38:47.300
There are fires right next to me here.

38:47.391 --> 38:48.766
There's a man in the truck.

38:48.852 --> 38:51.224
Help! Help!

38:51.313 --> 38:53.104
Get me outta here!

38:53.191 --> 38:54.816
Help!

38:54.901 --> 38:58.946
It's getting harder and harder
to hear anything. The roar is constant.

38:59.032 --> 39:01.523
It's loud. I can barely hear myself think.

39:01.619 --> 39:07.873
There's steam going up from manholes
and all I hear is just this roaring sound...

39:58.945 --> 40:00.060
Oh, my God!

40:14.340 --> 40:15.371
Mitch...

40:16.551 --> 40:20.419
Mitch, I don't know how to describe this,
but the Tar Pits are on fire

40:20.515 --> 40:22.923
and are spilling out
on to Wilshire Boulevard.

40:23.018 --> 40:26.518
It's coming right up out of the ground itself.

40:26.606 --> 40:30.141
It's as if the tar caught fire,
melted and somehow expanded.

40:30.236 --> 40:33.522
- The downed fire truck is still on its side,
- Help!

40:33.615 --> 40:36.819
- Injured firefighters in need of medical help.
- Hang on!

40:36.911 --> 40:39.200
Rescue personnel are starting to arrive.

40:39.290 --> 40:43.834
I know this sounds crazy, but it looks like
volcanic lava pouring onto the street.

40:50.972 --> 40:52.252
Dad!

40:52.349 --> 40:54.674
Kelly.

41:11.332 --> 41:12.957
Ah!

41:13.043 --> 41:15.451
Dad, hurry! My leg, it's burning!

41:17.716 --> 41:21.715
Stay calm, don't panic.
We'll get you out of here. Come on.

41:29.898 --> 41:33.433
- OK, baby, here we go. You're gonna be fine.
- Ah! Look out!

41:34.863 --> 41:36.856
Dad, your feet!

41:36.949 --> 41:39.025
Don't worry. Look, we're gonna jump.

41:39.119 --> 41:40.862
All right?

41:40.955 --> 41:42.153
Here we go.

41:42.248 --> 41:45.084
We're gonna be fine. OK?

42:03.192 --> 42:06.312
There seems to be a downed...

42:06.405 --> 42:10.867
- It seems to be a fireman in the truck.
- Driver still inside! Somebody get him out!

42:10.953 --> 42:12.495
Get me outta here!

42:12.580 --> 42:15.784
I can't move! Help!

42:15.876 --> 42:20.622
- Give me your arm! Your arm!
- Get me outta here! Get me outta here!

42:24.220 --> 42:26.890
My God, two firemen just burned alive!

42:26.974 --> 42:29.644
This is horrible... horrible!

42:35.485 --> 42:36.434
Get those out!

42:36.528 --> 42:41.950
They're dragging other firemen off the street
now in an effort to save their lives.

42:42.036 --> 42:44.574
- Watch his left leg.
- Somebody give me a hand!

42:44.664 --> 42:48.994
All the suffering and human carnage
alongside incredible bravery...

42:49.087 --> 42:53.964
Pull back. Pull back.
We gotta get more units here.

43:01.019 --> 43:02.098
Watch out for his leg.

43:03.731 --> 43:06.401
This girl has a burn on her leg.
Can you help her, too?

43:06.485 --> 43:10.104
I'm taking these men to Cedars.
You want me to take her, too?

43:10.198 --> 43:11.229
Dad!

43:15.330 --> 43:17.073
Don't worry, darling. You'll be OK.

43:17.165 --> 43:20.700
Stay calm. Give me that telephone!

43:20.795 --> 43:26.586
That was a large truck, and now it's just
a huge fireball burning out of control.

43:26.678 --> 43:28.885
Emmit, we're at level one here.

43:28.973 --> 43:34.977
I want you to have CHP close all off-ramps
on the 10 at La Brea, La Cienega, Fairfax

43:35.064 --> 43:38.683
and bump that traffic perimeter
to ten blocks away from the Tar Pits.

43:38.777 --> 43:41.351
- Got it. What...
- I will give details later,

43:41.448 --> 43:42.942
just get it done!

43:43.033 --> 43:45.869
Get some hoses
on those trees up there, fellas.

43:45.953 --> 43:49.952
Turn the traffic round on Wilshire.
Back up, get outta here.

43:50.042 --> 43:51.702
- You're OEM, right?
- Yeah.

43:51.795 --> 43:54.084
You need to be here. She doesn't.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.833
- She's my daughter.
- Yes.

43:55.925 --> 44:00.054
This is a second-degree burn.
I'll take her to Cedars.

44:00.139 --> 44:02.809
- Ow!
- It'll be fine, but it could get infected.

44:02.893 --> 44:06.726
Here's my name and my pager number.

44:06.814 --> 44:08.854
This is no place for her, you know it.

44:08.942 --> 44:12.561
- Dad, we're going home, right?
- This is not a safe place for you to be.

44:12.656 --> 44:15.408
- You need that leg taken care of.
- I wanna stay with you.

44:15.493 --> 44:16.691
She got any allergies?

44:16.786 --> 44:21.698
No. This lady's name is Dr. Jaye Calder,
honey. She's a doctor. She's gonna help you.

44:21.793 --> 44:23.869
Watch your feet there.

44:24.755 --> 44:29.252
I want you to go with her. I'll talk to you
by phone as soon as you get to the hospital.

44:29.344 --> 44:31.918
- There's my card.
- Please, you can't leave me.

44:32.014 --> 44:34.339
Honey, you cannot be here and I have to stay.

44:34.434 --> 44:36.474
- Why?
- Because it's my responsibility.

44:36.562 --> 44:37.344
So am I.

44:39.065 --> 44:41.224
Please, I promise I won't get in the way.

44:42.820 --> 44:43.851
Just go.

44:43.947 --> 44:44.777
Go!

44:44.865 --> 44:46.324
- Go!
- Dad!

44:52.124 --> 44:53.915
Dad!

45:04.307 --> 45:06.798
- Hand me the radio. I really need it!
- No!

45:08.688 --> 45:10.396
You guys got any radios?

45:10.482 --> 45:15.026
We've got a lot of confused people below us
running round terrified.

45:15.113 --> 45:18.530
This man...
well, I can't even guess where he's running.

45:18.618 --> 45:21.904
I don't think so, Chief.
Why would Mike be running around?

45:21.997 --> 45:24.369
- That's Mike Roark.
- Shut up! What?

45:24.459 --> 45:30.546
No. I just talked to Michael. He was in the car.
And, besides, this guy's a lot... taller.

45:30.634 --> 45:33.885
Look, Chief, I'm swamped right now.
I'll call you back.

45:33.972 --> 45:36.973
- What the hell is that?
- Yes. All right, Reese out.

45:38.936 --> 45:40.644
You guys seeing this shit?

45:41.189 --> 45:44.190
What can only be described as lava

45:44.277 --> 45:48.145
is now snaking its way
down Stanley Avenue, just off Wilshire.

45:52.162 --> 45:57.205
This is Stanley Avenue, just off Wilshire. The
house behind me just exploded into flames

45:57.294 --> 45:59.999
and, to put it bluntly,
all hell is breaking loose.

46:00.089 --> 46:03.755
You can see the panic in residents' faces.
The fear and distress...

46:03.844 --> 46:07.593
God knows what it is,
but something fiery is raining down.

46:07.683 --> 46:09.261
It's a war zone here!

46:09.352 --> 46:12.223
- My dog is in there.
- You can't go in.

46:12.314 --> 46:15.814
But my dog is in there. Phil, come here, boy!

46:17.571 --> 46:23.112
- My dog is in there!
- You just gotta hang on in. He'll be OK.

46:23.203 --> 46:25.030
Phil! Come here, boy.

46:43.939 --> 46:45.219
Come here, Phil.

46:46.526 --> 46:51.569
Oh, Phil! Oh, you good dog.
You got it. You got it, boy.

46:51.658 --> 46:54.909
It's my house, man. I was born in that house.

46:54.996 --> 46:55.909
I know, I know.

46:55.997 --> 46:58.405
Fire trucks! How come I see no fire trucks?

46:58.500 --> 47:01.288
- They're up on Wilshire.
- I'm gonna get some help.

47:07.679 --> 47:10.799
- Um, I think you should pull over.
- Why?

47:10.892 --> 47:13.383
Because this guy's leg, it's like gushing.

47:13.478 --> 47:17.690
There's a blanket underneath him.
Get it and press it down over the wound hard.

47:17.776 --> 47:19.187
I think you should just...

47:19.278 --> 47:23.359
If I don't get to the hospital, I'll lose
both these guys. Now, do what I tell you

47:23.450 --> 47:25.490
and help me out here.

47:25.578 --> 47:30.407
Look, Kelly, I know you're scared.
I'm scared, too.

47:30.501 --> 47:32.577
So I'm gonna need your help.

47:33.755 --> 47:35.214
Help me, OK?

47:43.226 --> 47:47.011
No-one has any idea
what to put in the way of this lava.

47:47.106 --> 47:51.021
Declaration of emergency,
assistance from county, state and federal.

47:51.111 --> 47:56.652
All available National Guard units
and air tankers. We need water dropped.

47:56.744 --> 48:01.372
OK, listen, Mike. I've got a bunch of meds
coming in. I'll ride 'em over to Midway, OK?

48:01.459 --> 48:05.410
No, send 'em to Cedars. That's where
we're sending patients. Safest place.

48:05.506 --> 48:07.048
All right, Cedars. Good.

48:07.133 --> 48:12.341
I got a message from Sindelar. He's stuck
on "the damn freeway. " Wants me to tell you...

48:12.431 --> 48:16.180
- I've got a desk. That's where I work.
... yadda yadda yadda.

48:16.270 --> 48:18.678
- Tell him not to expect me. Out.
- No problem.

48:18.773 --> 48:20.682
Mitch, it's a chaotic scene,

48:20.776 --> 48:24.027
with emergency personnel
desperate to stop this thing.

48:24.114 --> 48:26.985
Officer,
do you know where the driver of that bus is?

48:27.076 --> 48:29.912
- What are you talking about?
- Come with me. Come on.

48:29.996 --> 48:33.081
...rolling past
the foot of County Art Museum...

48:33.167 --> 48:35.955
We now have a name for this crisis.

48:36.046 --> 48:39.581
It is, according to the US Geological Survey,
a volcano.

48:39.676 --> 48:44.635
Yes, you heard that correctly.
As remarkable as it sounds, a volcano here

48:44.724 --> 48:48.853
- Excuse me!
- Is wreaking havoc throughout the city...

48:52.151 --> 48:53.645
Oh, my God.

49:00.412 --> 49:02.571
You would have loved this, Rachel.

49:05.335 --> 49:08.206
- Cover! Cover!
- Hey.

49:08.297 --> 49:12.046
Hey, no. Look at it. Keep watching it.

49:13.178 --> 49:15.337
Now! Move, you guys!

49:20.688 --> 49:22.977
It's a lava bomb.

49:23.067 --> 49:26.401
You don't do anything un...

49:28.073 --> 49:30.611
until you know where it's gonna land.

49:30.702 --> 49:33.787
I need 20 strong men standing right here.

49:33.873 --> 49:37.574
Go get those firemen right now,
and those officers right there.

49:37.669 --> 49:41.039
Get over here, guys. Over by this bus.

49:41.132 --> 49:44.833
- Right now. Let's go, hurry up.
- God, this Hieronymus Bosch is heavy.

49:44.929 --> 49:50.601
That's cos he deals with man's inclination
to a thing, in defiance of God's will.

49:50.687 --> 49:52.810
I didn't mean it like that.

49:52.898 --> 49:54.143
Oh.

49:54.233 --> 49:55.644
Fellas, come over here.

49:55.735 --> 49:57.977
- Right over here. You were right.
- Hardly.

49:58.071 --> 50:01.690
Gentlemen, I want to move the bus
up against the museum like so.

50:01.785 --> 50:02.567
Like so!?

50:02.661 --> 50:06.196
Yes, like so. Then I wanna
shoot out the tires on the other side.

50:06.290 --> 50:10.241
I cannot turn it over
unless the tires on one side are flat, all right?

50:12.507 --> 50:15.959
What we wanna do is build a corridor
to keep whatever this is...

50:16.053 --> 50:17.084
It's lava.

50:17.180 --> 50:20.514
All right, it's lava.
Get round to the front, fellas. Hurry up.

50:20.601 --> 50:22.392
Get around the front of the bus.

50:22.479 --> 50:26.893
All right, on the count of three, fellas.
One... two

50:26.985 --> 50:27.850
three.

50:40.669 --> 50:44.714
Come on. Police officers on the other side,
shoot out those tires.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.709
The rest of you guys, along this bus.

50:46.802 --> 50:48.177
Come here.

50:48.263 --> 50:50.303
All right, on the countdown, aim low.

50:50.391 --> 50:52.799
Three, two, one, fire.

50:57.692 --> 51:01.192
All right, we know that stuff is lava.
What do I do next?

51:01.280 --> 51:05.409
You have to evacuate the West Side. This'll
burn through the city till it hits the ocean.

51:05.494 --> 51:09.493
- It has a million people.
- There'll be a million dead or homeless.

51:09.583 --> 51:14.127
This is going to destroy
everything it touches.

51:19.387 --> 51:21.925
- He's still breathing. Can you grab this arm?
- Yeah.

51:22.016 --> 51:23.510
Grab him right there.

51:25.354 --> 51:26.682
Let's go, let's go!

51:26.772 --> 51:28.052
Let's get this guy out.

51:28.149 --> 51:31.566
Are you realizing what we're dealing with?
This is a volcano.

51:31.654 --> 51:35.237
- All we can do is get out of its way.
- Run for the hills and hide?

51:35.325 --> 51:36.819
- Right.
- I can't do that.

51:36.911 --> 51:37.860
Look out!

51:37.954 --> 51:38.784
Look out!

51:50.262 --> 51:52.469
Stay with this guy. Stay with him.

51:52.556 --> 51:54.549
Hey, get that ladder over here now!

51:57.521 --> 51:58.600
Bring it down!

51:58.689 --> 52:01.643
- What're you gonna do?
- Get us outta here if I can.

52:01.735 --> 52:04.902
Hey, watch out for those flames!

52:04.989 --> 52:09.153
Get that ladder out of the fire!
The hose is gonna burn!

52:09.245 --> 52:12.946
- Clear!
- Ah!

52:13.042 --> 52:15.533
- Outta here. Move!
- We're not gonna do this.

52:15.628 --> 52:17.751
Pull him out!

52:17.840 --> 52:19.465
- Move!
- Oh, my God.

52:22.387 --> 52:23.881
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Hang on.

52:23.973 --> 52:27.224
- Push him in!
- I can't. The ladder's bust. Too much weight.

52:27.311 --> 52:30.478
- I'm gonna have to swing 'em over.
- Move it!

52:32.234 --> 52:35.817
- Couldn't he swing us the other way?
- I'll ask him when we get down.

52:35.905 --> 52:39.654
The hose is burning! The hose is on fire!

52:39.744 --> 52:41.867
- Argh!
- Shit!

52:41.955 --> 52:44.197
- Hold on!
- I'm holding on!

52:44.291 --> 52:46.782
Faster. Move it. They're cookin' up there!

52:46.878 --> 52:49.500
My feet are burning! My feet are burning!

52:49.590 --> 52:52.675
Keep the guy still!
The ladder's gonna give!

52:52.761 --> 52:56.095
- My foot!
- Keep it still!

52:56.182 --> 53:00.133
- The ladder's going. We're losing it.
- Keep still! You're moving us!

53:01.356 --> 53:02.850
- Move it.
- Hang on!

53:02.941 --> 53:04.768
Stop kicking! Argh!

53:08.448 --> 53:10.322
Oh!

53:10.409 --> 53:11.868
Oh, my God!

53:14.164 --> 53:18.293
This guy needs oxygen!
Get him over to Cedars right away.

53:18.378 --> 53:19.208
You all right?

53:20.923 --> 53:23.165
Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.

53:23.260 --> 53:26.345
- Are you all right!?
- Yeah, I've never been better.

53:26.431 --> 53:28.507
So, what do we do now? Come on.

53:59.941 --> 54:01.732
That lava is coming from a vent.

54:01.818 --> 54:06.113
Bad news is there could be other vents,
bigger ones, maybe ten times as big,

54:06.199 --> 54:09.366
which means we may not have seen
the main eruption yet.

54:09.453 --> 54:12.704
- You think that's gonna happen?
- I need specifics, a phone.

54:12.791 --> 54:14.950
- Your phone! Give me that.
- Hey! I need that back.

54:15.044 --> 54:19.125
- I'm on the air. I need that back.
- Stay where you are. Stay where you are!

54:19.216 --> 54:22.502
- Hey, lava's moving round the bus!
- Give me that phone.

54:22.596 --> 54:25.800
- Hey, that's property of KNX.
- Not any more, pal.

54:26.768 --> 54:30.434
All right, Emmit,
get me 200 K-rails to build a corridor.

54:30.523 --> 54:33.477
- What are K-rails?
- They're concrete freeway dividers.

54:33.568 --> 54:35.359
You planning on channeling this?

54:35.446 --> 54:37.605
- I'm on the telephone, all right.
- Sorry.

54:37.699 --> 54:40.653
Mike, I'll call Public Works.
They could have some.

54:40.745 --> 54:43.746
- Roark?
- Yeah, and any private contractor we have...

54:43.832 --> 54:44.412
Roark!

54:50.424 --> 54:51.503
Hell!

54:52.510 --> 54:56.674
And call Gator. Cedars is gonna be swamped.
I want him over there.

54:56.766 --> 54:58.426
You don't want him with you?

54:58.518 --> 55:00.807
No, Kelly is on her way to Cedars now.

55:00.896 --> 55:02.176
She got burnt, Emmit.

55:03.650 --> 55:04.681
Shit.

55:04.776 --> 55:07.777
She'll have a suite
by the time the sun comes up, all right?

55:07.864 --> 55:09.109
All right. Out. What?

55:09.199 --> 55:11.821
The bus is just deflecting this, OK?

55:11.911 --> 55:17.333
It is coming back around. It's got in the store.
We are dealing with determined stuff here.

55:17.418 --> 55:20.503
All right,
we'll build berms until the K-rails get here.

55:20.589 --> 55:24.006
- With what?
- We'll dig up the streets, we'll improvise.

55:28.892 --> 55:34.932
Literally hundreds of firemen,
police, city workers have grabbed pickaxes

55:35.025 --> 55:38.560
to try to channel this down...

55:38.655 --> 55:42.819
...the ash and the smoke in the air right now.

55:42.910 --> 55:45.746
...to make a dentin this latest attack on LA.

55:45.831 --> 55:49.035
That wall has to be five or six meters tall.
Stay with it.

55:49.127 --> 55:53.589
It's hitting every street. We've got
structural fires and inhalation cases.

55:53.674 --> 55:55.714
- I can't keep it out without help.
- I'm working on it.

55:55.802 --> 56:01.224
Meantime, do all you can to keep it
on Wilshire. Use fire trucks, if you have to.

56:01.310 --> 56:05.391
My street's on fire.
You gotta get some trucks down there.

56:05.482 --> 56:09.065
- What street?
- The one with smoke coming out. Stanley.

56:09.153 --> 56:12.404
- Once this is under control.
- There won't be houses left by then!

56:12.491 --> 56:14.947
Look, I'm sorry. We'll get to 'em when we can.

56:15.036 --> 56:18.737
Yo, I'm talking about people's houses.
You're up here saving museums.

56:18.833 --> 56:20.493
D'you wanna get this guy off me?

56:20.585 --> 56:23.705
- Oh, great. Mark Fuhrman.
- Let me see your hands.

56:23.798 --> 56:25.755
- You gotta be joking.
- Give me your hands!

56:27.302 --> 56:28.962
Get your goddamn hands off me!

56:29.055 --> 56:30.383
Hey, what's going on?

56:30.473 --> 56:34.139
- He was harassing a firefighter.
- Bullshit. I was asking for help.

56:34.228 --> 56:36.684
- This is stupid. Let him go.
- I'm taking him in.

56:36.773 --> 56:38.184
Aw, he's all yours.

56:38.275 --> 56:41.276
- Shouldn't you be saving lives?
- Don't move!

56:41.363 --> 56:45.825
Watch that third rail.
I don't want anybody hitting that.

56:45.910 --> 56:49.114
Hey, watch for the rubble right there!
Watch for the rubble.

56:51.209 --> 56:53.118
Oh, Jesus.

56:53.212 --> 56:56.332
- There she is.
- Looks like we got a hell of a fire, Stan.

56:56.424 --> 56:57.337
Yeah, we sure do.

56:57.426 --> 56:59.668
Right, let's go, let's go, double time!

56:59.762 --> 57:03.926
It can't be gas, they turned off
the whole quadrant. Gotta be electrical.

57:04.018 --> 57:08.562
Call LAFD! Tell them there's a fire
500 yards from MacArthur Park station!

57:08.649 --> 57:13.193
Get those first-aid kits
and those oxygen masks down here now!

57:13.280 --> 57:15.356
Here, give me that.

57:15.825 --> 57:17.984
Come on. Hit it.

57:19.538 --> 57:21.827
Come on, hit it!

57:25.671 --> 57:27.794
Oh, my God.

57:31.262 --> 57:32.922
Give me a push.

57:33.014 --> 57:37.760
- Let's check these people out in here.
- Check 'em out.

57:37.854 --> 57:39.728
I got a pulse! Get the other one.

57:39.815 --> 57:43.149
How many we got?
Give me a count here! Give me a count!

57:43.236 --> 57:44.516
Some oxygen up here.

57:46.991 --> 57:48.569
Stan.

57:48.660 --> 57:50.368
Just a second. Just a second.

57:50.454 --> 57:51.236
Stan!

57:51.330 --> 57:54.664
Let's get everybody out on the station floor.

57:54.751 --> 57:56.827
What you got, Pete?

57:58.548 --> 58:00.291
What the hell is that?

58:07.560 --> 58:08.758
Get off the train...

58:08.853 --> 58:10.644
Get off the train! Get off the train!

58:10.731 --> 58:14.564
Every one of these bodies off the train now!
Fireman's carry, go, go!

58:14.653 --> 58:17.690
- We can't get 'em all.
- Anybody see the driver?

58:18.700 --> 58:19.862
Give me your gloves.

58:19.952 --> 58:22.490
- What're you doing?
- I gotta find the driver.

58:22.622 --> 58:27.451
Every one of these people off the train now.
Come on, move it! Move it! Go! Go!

58:28.963 --> 58:30.588
Stan, get back here!

58:33.428 --> 58:38.720
We are in the parking lot at Cedars Sinai
and this is an incredible scene.

58:38.810 --> 58:41.480
These people are staying in the parking lot

58:41.563 --> 58:45.396
because the emergency room
is filled to capacity.

58:45.485 --> 58:48.605
The injured just keep coming here
one after another.

58:48.698 --> 58:55.283
This, to me, seems more like a MASH unit
than a major metropolitan hospital...

58:55.373 --> 58:57.282
Yeah?

58:57.376 --> 58:59.499
- Gator, you got my girl?
- Right here.

58:59.587 --> 59:03.004
- Doc says she's gonna be fine.
- Nearly done.

59:03.092 --> 59:05.630
All right, let me talk to her.

59:11.353 --> 59:15.304
Man's got a direct line to the governor,
but he's calling you.

59:15.400 --> 59:20.193
- I'm fine, Daddy. Honestly... I'm OK.
- This is gonna sting.

59:20.281 --> 59:21.775
OK?

59:23.202 --> 59:26.038
- I love you, baby.
- Then stop sending us bodies.

59:26.122 --> 59:29.539
- We have got a full house over here.
- I don't have any choice.

59:29.627 --> 59:34.967
Cedars Sinai is the only emergency room
that's still safe and north of the flow.

59:35.051 --> 59:38.586
We got earthquake victims,
burns, smoke inhalations.

59:38.681 --> 59:41.137
They're doing triage on the sidewalk.

59:41.226 --> 59:45.604
Put the post-ops in the mall.
Beverly Center's gotta have its own power.

59:45.690 --> 59:47.268
- The mall, huh?
- Yeah.

59:47.359 --> 59:48.734
Anything good at the cineplex?

59:50.363 --> 59:52.486
Have the cops close the streets for you.

59:57.289 --> 59:59.282
Oh, goddammit.

01:00:00.919 --> 01:00:02.461
Jesus H Christ.

01:00:03.839 --> 01:00:06.627
- See that? The flow's gonna turn.
- Yeah, I saw it.

01:00:06.718 --> 01:00:10.551
- What's south of here, Lieutenant?
- Convalescent homes, hospitals.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.935
I'll tell you. A big gas station,
a million houses and everyone I know.

01:00:15.021 --> 01:00:17.559
Get back in there.
We need everybody we can get.

01:00:17.649 --> 01:00:18.562
Shit!

01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:21.901
Emmit, where are those K-rails?
I need 'em right now.

01:00:21.988 --> 01:00:26.152
Hey, what were you trying to do?
Take that guy downtown?

01:00:26.244 --> 01:00:29.744
- Better take the freeway. Wilshire looks bad.
- Hey, enough!

01:00:29.832 --> 01:00:32.157
Let's get these people on the cart.

01:00:32.252 --> 01:00:35.419
Come on, Stan. Come on, Stan.
Where the hell are you?

01:01:12.096 --> 01:01:15.382
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.

01:01:15.476 --> 01:01:18.050
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

01:01:20.315 --> 01:01:24.527
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.

01:01:24.613 --> 01:01:28.398
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women,

01:01:28.493 --> 01:01:32.326
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
Holy Mary, mother of God...

01:01:32.415 --> 01:01:36.081
- Get on the walkie...
- Hey, it's Stan!

01:01:40.133 --> 01:01:43.087
Jump, Stan! Come on, Stan! Go!

01:01:44.139 --> 01:01:46.013
Stan, get outta there!

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.475
Jump!

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:52.104
- Get outta here!
- No, Stan! You can't save him!

01:01:52.191 --> 01:01:53.602
Come on, jump!

01:01:56.405 --> 01:01:59.276
- Come on!
- Come on! Save yourself!

01:02:01.245 --> 01:02:02.704
No!

01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:11.464
Aaahhhhhhh!

01:02:14.095 --> 01:02:17.180
Aaahhh!

01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:18.131
Ah!

01:02:27.446 --> 01:02:31.029
- Emmit, FAA want an update.
- Where are we with the airports?

01:02:31.117 --> 01:02:34.487
No more outgoing.
Incoming is being re-routed to Ontario.

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.407
No, no, no, no. Marty, no.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:41.578
Look at the screen. That cloud is blowing due
east. We gotta send everything to San Diego.

01:02:41.673 --> 01:02:47.214
Emmit, they got two gas lines burning on
Fairfax. They can't get any hydrant pressure.

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:48.966
- Swimming pools.
- What about them?

01:02:49.058 --> 01:02:53.187
Pump out all the swimming pools.
That's all the water we need.

01:02:53.272 --> 01:02:57.436
Emmit, just got a call from La Brea.
Total gridlock from Pico to Sunset.

01:02:57.527 --> 01:03:01.146
- Didn't we send over those traffic cops?
- That's who's calling.

01:03:01.241 --> 01:03:03.483
Cars keep stalling out because of the ash.

01:03:03.577 --> 01:03:06.448
- It's clogging up the air filters.
- Chevettes, right?

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:12.418
OK, now you can see it coming right at us.

01:03:12.506 --> 01:03:18.925
Just a relentless tide of lava melting the street
itself. It incinerates everything it touches.

01:03:19.014 --> 01:03:23.013
They're using concrete, they're using cars...

01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:27.647
- You gotta get me some water pressure!
- I can't. The city's out.

01:03:27.734 --> 01:03:30.023
- Hydrants are dry!
- Lights are out in San Francisco.

01:03:30.112 --> 01:03:33.232
- We gotta get these guys some help.
- Yeah, I can see that.

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:38.789
Don't you hear me?
I said the lights are out in San Francisco.

01:03:38.874 --> 01:03:42.955
But this street's on fire.
Nobody gives a shit about San Francisco!

01:04:04.825 --> 01:04:07.447
All right, good to see you.

01:04:07.537 --> 01:04:12.781
We want a corridor outta these K-rails. Keep it
flowing down Wilshire and headed west, OK?

01:04:12.877 --> 01:04:15.202
- Where are the rest of them?
- This is it.

01:04:15.297 --> 01:04:19.426
- There's only about 80 here.
- 82. Everything else is stuck on the 5 or 10.

01:04:19.511 --> 01:04:22.963
We're trying to keep the city in one piece.
80 rails won't do it!

01:04:23.057 --> 01:04:25.216
- What you blaming me for?
- Convenience!

01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:28.644
- Maybe we can chopper more in?
- One at at time, forget it!

01:04:28.732 --> 01:04:33.062
Why not knock down a couple of buildings
and block this son of a bitch?

01:04:33.154 --> 01:04:35.063
All right, come with me.

01:04:35.157 --> 01:04:36.984
You guys, come with me.

01:04:38.494 --> 01:04:40.985
- Open a reservoir!
- And the city drinks what?!

01:04:41.081 --> 01:04:43.619
- There won't be a city, if you don't move.
- I'm doing my best!

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:46.462
Knock this shit off! What is with you people?

01:04:46.547 --> 01:04:49.418
Chief, how long will it take this stuff
to get to Fairfax?

01:04:49.509 --> 01:04:54.421
- About ten minutes, give or take.
- Enough time to build a barricade?

01:04:57.353 --> 01:05:02.396
All right, look.
Wilshire Boulevard, Fairfax.

01:05:02.485 --> 01:05:04.810
80 K-rails, double stacked in a horseshoe.

01:05:04.904 --> 01:05:05.900
OK?

01:05:07.116 --> 01:05:08.314
A cul-de-sac.

01:05:09.244 --> 01:05:11.866
That's gotta be a wall at least 6ft high.

01:05:11.955 --> 01:05:15.954
- D'you have any helicopters, water tankers?
- Not yet, but they're on the way.

01:05:16.044 --> 01:05:21.669
Once you get this lava to pool, dump
everything on it, all at once, to form a crust.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.967
Maybe it'll dam itself like one did in Iceland.

01:05:24.931 --> 01:05:27.220
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:29.516
This is putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg.

01:05:29.604 --> 01:05:32.771
I don't know how many men
to keep putting in front of this thing.

01:05:32.858 --> 01:05:34.483
As many people as it takes.

01:05:34.569 --> 01:05:37.191
Listen up, let me tell you what's south of us.

01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:41.991
No more museums or department stores,
just homes, people.

01:05:42.079 --> 01:05:44.155
If we run now, they're defenseless.

01:05:44.248 --> 01:05:48.116
You don't like my plan, give me another one,
but don't say we're backing out.

01:05:48.212 --> 01:05:50.964
- Is everybody clear on that?
- Yeah!

01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:53.208
All right, let's go. Build a wall.

01:06:05.151 --> 01:06:06.645
Come on, push him over.

01:06:06.736 --> 01:06:08.314
Push him over.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.449
All right, come on. Push 'em on in.

01:06:16.875 --> 01:06:19.413
Give me 14 or 15 guys
on each of these things.

01:06:19.503 --> 01:06:21.460
Right over here on this K-rail.

01:06:21.548 --> 01:06:25.333
Right in here. Hold it.
On the other side. Watch your leg!

01:06:27.222 --> 01:06:30.888
Right over here, fellas.
There's room by there. Pick 'em up.

01:06:34.315 --> 01:06:36.308
Let's go. Lift!

01:06:41.032 --> 01:06:43.784
- Come on.
- We need more guys on this one.

01:06:45.621 --> 01:06:46.866
Shit, it's too heavy.

01:06:49.293 --> 01:06:53.374
Hey, man, you know what they say.
No pain, no gain.

01:06:53.465 --> 01:06:54.627
All right, that's it!

01:06:54.717 --> 01:06:58.300
I knew it, I'm about to be
the volcano version of Rodney King.

01:06:58.388 --> 01:07:00.013
Give me your hand.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:03.017
- Roll the tape. Y'all got this?
- Give me your hands.

01:07:05.105 --> 01:07:06.385
Go home.

01:07:06.482 --> 01:07:08.724
- I'm supposed to say thanks?
- No.

01:07:08.819 --> 01:07:11.524
- What did you do that for?
- Let's go.

01:07:11.614 --> 01:07:16.111
Still don't have enough guys over here!
Give us a hand.

01:07:16.203 --> 01:07:19.703
Come on.

01:07:23.755 --> 01:07:24.786
Come on!

01:07:24.881 --> 01:07:27.419
You block this,
it stays out the neighborhood?

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:28.921
Yeah, that's the idea.

01:07:32.433 --> 01:07:34.592
Come on. Let's go. Come on, move! Move!

01:07:35.687 --> 01:07:37.478
Come on! What you waiting for?

01:07:37.565 --> 01:07:41.564
- Come on.
- All right! Let's move this thing!

01:07:41.654 --> 01:07:44.905
1... 2... 3!

01:07:45.158 --> 01:07:46.154
Aagh!

01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:57.001
OK, keep moving.

01:07:57.091 --> 01:07:59.629
Put it over there!

01:07:59.719 --> 01:08:02.804
With so many people injured,

01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:07.553
it is so easy to forget the victims
who can't tell you where it hurts.

01:08:07.646 --> 01:08:12.475
And, fortunately, these wonderful
veterinarians have put their lives on hold

01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:13.898
to help these animals.

01:08:13.988 --> 01:08:19.232
This is a great story. This pot-bellied pig
was trying to find his owner...

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:23.410
OK, just one more stitch.
You're really brave, you know that?

01:08:23.501 --> 01:08:24.781
We got internal bleeding here.

01:08:26.171 --> 01:08:27.712
Can you watch her?

01:08:32.261 --> 01:08:33.460
Are you OK?

01:08:34.599 --> 01:08:36.176
Yeah.

01:08:37.185 --> 01:08:38.810
- Is the boy hers?
- Yes.

01:08:38.895 --> 01:08:42.515
- We're putting kids in the mall. Prep her.
- Mommy.

01:08:42.609 --> 01:08:43.640
Mommy...

01:08:43.736 --> 01:08:45.812
How are you at baby-sitting?

01:08:49.743 --> 01:08:51.154
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:08:51.246 --> 01:08:52.906
You OK?

01:08:54.834 --> 01:08:56.707
- Step up, we don't have a lotta time!
- Roark!

01:08:56.795 --> 01:08:59.631
- Yeah?
- There is lava in the Red Line.

01:08:59.715 --> 01:09:04.758
Just came through on the emergency band.
It destroyed a train near MacArthur Park.

01:09:04.846 --> 01:09:07.966
- Is it still flowing?
- It's stopped, but I think there's more.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:12.474
There's got to be something
feeding this from below. A source.

01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:15.603
It broke through here, at the Tar Pits,
created this vent.

01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:20.821
We now know it broke through at MacArthur
Park, so it's traveling laterally underground

01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:23.366
over the course of at least eight miles.

01:09:23.455 --> 01:09:27.073
- You said it blows up.
- I've never tracked lava under a city before.

01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:30.335
I don't know what it'll do
with man-made tunnels to travel through.

01:09:30.423 --> 01:09:36.095
I need everything to deal with what's
in front of me. I don't have time for a theory.

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:39.845
- All right, but somebody's got to.
- I can only fight what I can see.

01:09:39.935 --> 01:09:40.930
I know.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.095
Good luck. I'm gonna check it out.

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:44.220
All right.

01:09:44.316 --> 01:09:46.807
Here's a recap of the crisis as it stands.

01:09:46.903 --> 01:09:50.354
Throughout the city
shelters are being hastily erected

01:09:50.448 --> 01:09:57.948
out of schools, churches and synagogues
in an attempt to house the shaken citizens.

01:09:58.043 --> 01:10:01.210
OK, ready, you guys? OK, 1, 2, 3.

01:10:02.048 --> 01:10:03.376
Shh.

01:10:03.467 --> 01:10:06.172
Rock beats scissor and scissor beats paper.

01:10:06.262 --> 01:10:08.932
I'm not paper. I'm lava.

01:10:10.225 --> 01:10:11.968
What beats that?

01:10:14.773 --> 01:10:16.232
My dad...

01:10:16.651 --> 01:10:18.525
I hope.

01:11:03.004 --> 01:11:07.548
Save your hoses, Chief.
I wanna let it pool up all the way to the top.

01:11:07.635 --> 01:11:08.548
Save your hoses!

01:11:11.139 --> 01:11:12.966
Not a drop until I give the word.

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:22.727
We'll just have to wait it out now.

01:12:18.896 --> 01:12:20.853
This is the moment of truth.

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:25.568
- The entire street is now engulfed in flames.
- The weight of this lava has to be intense.

01:12:25.655 --> 01:12:30.448
...um das Lava zuruckdrangen.
- Will this plan work?

01:12:41.801 --> 01:12:45.634
- Hubschrauber!
- All right, that's it, Chief. Open 'em up!

01:12:45.723 --> 01:12:46.636
Open hoses.

01:12:46.724 --> 01:12:48.883
Open hoses!

01:13:42.548 --> 01:13:46.760
There must be thousands of gallons of water
being dropped over this entire area.

01:13:46.846 --> 01:13:49.005
The entire area is drenched

01:13:49.099 --> 01:13:51.887
and the steam coming off this thing
is unbelievable.

01:13:59.946 --> 01:14:01.986
Oh, shit.

01:14:27.942 --> 01:14:29.317
Oh, God.

01:14:44.005 --> 01:14:49.961
I don't believe it. It looks possible
that this whole thing maybe nearing an end.

01:14:50.054 --> 01:14:53.008
This incredible gamble
seems to be paying off.

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:56.304
- Did we just beat this bastard?
- It looks like it!

01:14:56.396 --> 01:14:57.807
Flood control!

01:14:57.898 --> 01:15:03.938
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a miracle.
And look at the faces of these people.

01:15:04.031 --> 01:15:06.819
Look at these guys!
It looks like they've done it.

01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:10.244
They have accomplished the impossible.

01:15:10.331 --> 01:15:16.952
They've beaten Mother Nature and claimed
an extraordinary victory over the volcano.

01:15:17.048 --> 01:15:21.510
One last heroic stand
here on the corner of Fairfaxand Wilshire.

01:15:21.596 --> 01:15:24.930
Hell of a party!
I probably should have brought a hat.

01:15:30.733 --> 01:15:37.152
Chief, they need some help over on Stanley.
Structural fires, residential.

01:15:37.242 --> 01:15:41.656
- Miller, get your engine over to Stanley.
- Yes, sir.

01:15:43.584 --> 01:15:45.458
I guess that's my bus.

01:15:45.545 --> 01:15:47.870
Hey, good luck.

01:15:49.258 --> 01:15:50.836
You, too, man.

01:15:56.643 --> 01:15:59.514
Show me what this baby can do.
You ready or what?

01:16:09.117 --> 01:16:13.827
Yo, I always wanted to ride one of these
things, man. Stanley Ave, here we come!

01:16:13.915 --> 01:16:16.038
Whoo!

01:16:16.127 --> 01:16:18.203
You're a good man, Jerry.

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:26.134
- All right, Roark.
- Thanks, fellas.

01:16:26.223 --> 01:16:29.059
Way to go, guys!

01:16:29.144 --> 01:16:30.519
Roark! Hey, way to go.

01:16:30.604 --> 01:16:33.309
How fast can you get to
Wilshire and Western? We got a problem.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.559
Not any more, we got it stopped.

01:16:35.653 --> 01:16:38.025
Volume of ash is too hot to be out of danger.

01:16:38.114 --> 01:16:39.525
How come it's stopped?

01:16:39.616 --> 01:16:43.401
- Maybe it went some place else.
- How d'you know it didn’t just stop?

01:16:43.496 --> 01:16:47.874
I don't, but when Mount St Helen's blew
the force was 27,000 times greater

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.285
than that of the Hiroshima bomb.

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:53.002
You think that vent
released that much energy?

01:16:53.092 --> 01:16:53.922
No.

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:56.964
Let's assume we haven’t seen
the real bulk of the magma yet.

01:16:57.056 --> 01:16:58.467
Trust me, get down here.

01:16:59.810 --> 01:17:00.806
Shit!

01:17:04.524 --> 01:17:06.517
Hey, hey, that's my bike.

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:10.774
As crews battled the flow on Wilshire,

01:17:10.866 --> 01:17:15.328
emergency rooms at Cedars Sinai
and Midway hospitals have all reported

01:17:15.414 --> 01:17:18.202
that their staffs and supplies
are being overwhelmed...

01:17:18.292 --> 01:17:18.956
Yes?

01:17:19.043 --> 01:17:21.581
Jaye, I want you home with me
where it's safe.

01:17:21.672 --> 01:17:23.250
Norman, can we talk later?

01:17:23.341 --> 01:17:25.666
I don't like his breathing. Let's tube him.

01:17:25.761 --> 01:17:29.012
Jaye, you've been there hours.
Let someone else take over!

01:17:29.098 --> 01:17:32.052
God knows
what those "people" are coughing up on you.

01:17:32.144 --> 01:17:33.306
Calder, we need help.

01:17:33.396 --> 01:17:34.724
- I'm hanging up.
- Jaye!

01:17:36.525 --> 01:17:37.141
Go!

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:46.195
- Right over the Red Line.
- That steam could come from anywhere.

01:17:46.288 --> 01:17:50.121
- Maybe the quake broke a water main.
- How'd it get heated?

01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:52.701
- I don't know.
- Lower me down. I'm gonna find out.

01:17:52.796 --> 01:17:54.456
- No.
- Why? Too dangerous?

01:17:54.549 --> 01:17:56.209
- Yes.
- I thought it was a water main.

01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:59.884
- All right. I'll go.
- How you gonna get up? I'm gonna lift you?

01:17:59.973 --> 01:18:03.390
- I'm not letting you go.
- Then what are we gonna do?

01:18:10.153 --> 01:18:14.781
Oh, God, this is so stupid.
This city's finally paying for its arrogance.

01:18:14.867 --> 01:18:17.738
Which particular arrogance is that?

01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:21.116
Building a subway
under land that's seismically active.

01:18:21.209 --> 01:18:24.460
It was a foolish man
that built his house upon the sand.

01:18:25.882 --> 01:18:29.133
Matthew 7:26. A favorite among geologists.

01:18:37.898 --> 01:18:41.315
All right, there's the tunnel.
I don't see anything.

01:18:41.402 --> 01:18:43.276
Hm. What way are we facing?

01:18:43.363 --> 01:18:45.023
I don't know.

01:18:48.412 --> 01:18:49.692
I can't see anything.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.262
- Hey!
- Wha...

01:19:03.557 --> 01:19:04.506
Oh!

01:19:11.025 --> 01:19:12.650
Damn.

01:19:19.745 --> 01:19:21.904
Ow! Damn!

01:19:21.998 --> 01:19:23.373
Oh, God.

01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:26.870
The tunnel's insulating it.

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:29.003
It's like a lava tube.

01:19:29.091 --> 01:19:32.211
It's keeping it fluid,
which is why it's moving so fast.

01:19:32.303 --> 01:19:33.382
But moving where?

01:19:33.471 --> 01:19:38.846
It's gonna go through the tunnels until it hits
a block. Once there, it'll punch through.

01:19:38.937 --> 01:19:40.811
You mean erupt.

01:19:41.524 --> 01:19:42.722
Yeah!

01:19:44.277 --> 01:19:46.104
One, two,

01:19:46.197 --> 01:19:47.572
three.

01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:54.077
One, two, three.

01:19:55.292 --> 01:19:57.534
- How far between tunnel sections?
- How should I know?

01:19:57.628 --> 01:19:59.253
- Guess!
- 10 or 12 feet.

01:19:59.339 --> 01:20:02.257
This is Roark.
I need to know where the Red Line stops.

01:20:02.343 --> 01:20:05.048
We gotta figure out
how fast this shit is moving.

01:20:05.138 --> 01:20:09.302
- You mean where the last station is?
- No, where did you stop the tunnel?

01:20:10.145 --> 01:20:13.645
We stopped drilling
under the Beverly Center, La Cienega.

01:20:13.733 --> 01:20:16.900
My God. That's where Cedars Sinai is.

01:20:16.987 --> 01:20:19.692
That's where Kelly is.
How long before it hits La Cienega?

01:20:21.744 --> 01:20:22.823
Hold on.

01:20:22.912 --> 01:20:26.661
- How long before it hits La Cienega?!
- I don't know.

01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:28.790
If a tunnel's caved in, it'll be slower.

01:20:30.463 --> 01:20:32.871
God. 30 minutes, maybe less.

01:20:32.967 --> 01:20:35.043
- That's not enough time!
- No kidding.

01:20:35.136 --> 01:20:37.129
We gotta move those people.

01:20:38.516 --> 01:20:42.645
No, no, that ain't a possibility, Mike.
We don't have any hands left.

01:20:42.730 --> 01:20:48.022
We got secondary fires popping off all
over the city. They're looting in Beverly Hills.

01:20:48.112 --> 01:20:52.276
Then we have to re-route it or block it
in some way. We got 2,000 people in the way.

01:20:52.367 --> 01:20:56.662
Listen, Moses couldn't re-route this shit, OK?
It's everywhere.

01:20:56.748 --> 01:20:58.705
We got a flow in a storm drain...

01:20:58.793 --> 01:21:01.201
The Genesee transformer's out.
That means the West...

01:21:01.296 --> 01:21:04.915
- Where's that storm drain go?
- It dumps into Ballona Creek.

01:21:05.009 --> 01:21:07.631
What did you just say?

01:21:07.721 --> 01:21:08.966
Hold it!

01:21:09.056 --> 01:21:10.515
It dumps into Ballona Creek.

01:21:11.142 --> 01:21:14.725
- Ballona Creek runs into the ocean.
- We caught a break on that one.

01:21:14.814 --> 01:21:17.768
Yeah. I would say! How close is it to Cedars?

01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:22.072
It's close enough. All right, listen up, Emmit.
I need a demolitions team,

01:21:22.157 --> 01:21:27.034
LAPD, National Guard, private contractor,
or all three at San Vicente

01:21:27.122 --> 01:21:28.700
and 3rd right now!

01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:30.700
We want 'em with all they've got.

01:21:42.851 --> 01:21:44.226
Oh, shit.

01:21:44.937 --> 01:21:46.728
Man, I wanna be like Mike.

01:21:47.357 --> 01:21:51.985
Right outside Cedars
we don’t know what's going on right now.

01:21:52.072 --> 01:21:56.652
Officials have told people here
to evacuate immediately.

01:21:56.744 --> 01:22:01.740
And realize, these are injured people,
some severely, so something is going on.

01:22:04.087 --> 01:22:06.412
All right, here's what the lava is doing.

01:22:06.507 --> 01:22:10.921
It will flow down the Red Line subway tunnel
until it comes to a dead end: This intersection.

01:22:11.013 --> 01:22:16.887
This is the Holly Hills storm drain extension.
It connects here to the Holly Hills trench.

01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:21.275
Anything that flows into that trench will come
through the storm drain, on to the ocean.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.353
- We got 25 minutes...
- 20 minutes.

01:22:23.446 --> 01:22:29.201
20 minutes to extend the San Vicente trench
200 yards up San Vicente Boulevard

01:22:29.288 --> 01:22:30.699
to this place here.

01:22:30.789 --> 01:22:32.663
- Extend it?
- Yes, extend it.

01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:36.369
- Where are we at?
- Ground zero. Lava'll break through here.

01:22:36.464 --> 01:22:37.792
- Right here?
- Yes.

01:22:37.882 --> 01:22:41.168
I want you
to drill holes in San Vicente Boulevard,

01:22:41.262 --> 01:22:46.055
lower enough charges into it to blow up
a trench 200 yards long, as wide as the street

01:22:46.143 --> 01:22:47.851
- and as deep as you can make.
- What!

01:22:47.937 --> 01:22:51.437
- We're gonna take this thing to the ocean.
- Wait, this won't work.

01:22:51.525 --> 01:22:55.274
The street slopes the other way.
Look at the contours.

01:22:55.364 --> 01:23:00.157
It is not going to move into the trench. It will
go the opposite direction into the patients.

01:23:00.245 --> 01:23:03.780
- Maybe some can be diverted...
- No! It won't. Would you trust me?

01:23:03.875 --> 01:23:05.784
It is going to flow that way.

01:23:05.878 --> 01:23:11.419
Now, everybody grab some stretchers.
Let's save as many lives as we possibly can.

01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:15.674
That's 2,000 patients.
We can't possibly save everybody.

01:23:15.766 --> 01:23:18.222
I know.
I sent them over there with my daughter.

01:23:22.066 --> 01:23:24.142
I... I...

01:23:25.195 --> 01:23:27.271
I... I don't know...

01:23:28.658 --> 01:23:30.781
I don't know what to do.

01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:45.927
What about a dam?

01:23:46.014 --> 01:23:49.715
Something we can drop in front
of the hospital and divert the flow this way?

01:23:49.811 --> 01:23:53.477
- What?
- What she said, knocking a building down?

01:23:53.566 --> 01:23:54.764
Are you serious?

01:23:54.859 --> 01:23:59.154
Yes, I'm serious. It's gotta be 50,000 tons
of steel and concrete. Would that work?

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.657
- You are gonna knock a building down?
- Yes, I am. Would it work?

01:24:02.745 --> 01:24:04.738
I think it might. I think it might.

01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:06.740
You wanna bring it down against the mall?

01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:07.579
Absolutely.

01:24:07.668 --> 01:24:10.835
That's a precision drop.
That takes days to plan.

01:24:12.591 --> 01:24:14.382
Set a speed record.

01:24:14.468 --> 01:24:16.959
You wanna
knock down a building in 20 minutes?

01:24:17.055 --> 01:24:17.505
19 now.

01:24:17.598 --> 01:24:19.389
Split the squad, let's go.

01:24:19.475 --> 01:24:21.218
What d'you want me to do?

01:24:25.441 --> 01:24:26.816
Find my daughter,

01:24:26.902 --> 01:24:28.527
please.

01:24:28.612 --> 01:24:32.563
I left her with a Dr. Jaye Calder.

01:24:32.659 --> 01:24:35.744
I gave that woman my child,
she gave me this card. Find her.

01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:39.164
OK. I'll find her, OK?

01:24:39.251 --> 01:24:41.244
Trust me, I'll find her.

01:24:45.843 --> 01:24:50.091
Sergeant, bring your men
and follow me right now!

01:24:51.351 --> 01:24:54.388
Come this way.
Put your first hole right there.

01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:58.728
Food.

01:24:58.819 --> 01:24:59.649
Where's Tommy?

01:24:59.737 --> 01:25:03.782
He went through there.
Can I have those French fries?

01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:22.254
Remain calm.
We are evacuating the triage unit now.

01:25:28.066 --> 01:25:31.020
- Excuse me, I'm looking for a little boy.
- Un momento.

01:25:32.614 --> 01:25:35.152
Have you seen a little boy?
He has blond hair.

01:25:36.285 --> 01:25:39.619
- You should be back in there.
- No, I'm looking for a little boy...

01:25:39.706 --> 01:25:44.001
- Red Cross people will find him.
- No, he's my responsibility.

01:25:44.087 --> 01:25:46.578
Everybody out.
We're evacuating the Hard Rock.

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:49.510
All right, people, evacuate.
We must leave right now.

01:25:49.594 --> 01:25:52.679
Put down what you're doing. Let's move...

01:26:01.902 --> 01:26:05.153
Come on, let's go. Coming through.

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.778
- Is the building empty?
- Yeah, all clear!

01:26:07.869 --> 01:26:11.998
We're told large amounts
of explosives are being brought in

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:16.331
from National Guard armories,
private contractors and LAPD depots.

01:26:16.422 --> 01:26:18.996
It's an extraordinary effort under way...

01:26:19.092 --> 01:26:20.123
Mommy!

01:26:26.435 --> 01:26:28.143
Tommy!

01:26:30.398 --> 01:26:32.438
Tommy!

01:26:32.526 --> 01:26:36.227
This urgent advisory
from the city's Emergency Operations Centre.

01:26:36.323 --> 01:26:39.906
Stay inside and stay away from the window.

01:26:47.546 --> 01:26:51.960
Stay clear of the Beverly Center.

01:26:52.052 --> 01:26:54.888
They put some kids in the mall.
In the Hard Rock.

01:26:54.973 --> 01:26:59.185
- OK, you've done your duty. Can we go now?
- D'you think she might still be there?

01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:02.770
Maybe. She was watching some children.
Norman, hold this. What we got?

01:27:02.858 --> 01:27:04.020
Thank you.

01:27:04.110 --> 01:27:05.569
Here. Take this.

01:27:05.653 --> 01:27:10.565
These people are strangers, Jaye.
Are you gonna die for them?

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:15.204
- Jaye! Answer me!
- I am answering you, Norman.

01:27:15.291 --> 01:27:18.376
This man's in cardiac arrest. I'm defibrillating!

01:27:18.462 --> 01:27:20.371
- Charging.
- Shit!

01:27:20.465 --> 01:27:22.125
- Clear!
- I'm outta here.

01:27:24.971 --> 01:27:26.596
Not much time. Hurry up.

01:27:26.681 --> 01:27:31.724
An amazing scene here,
as demolition teams pour into the area.

01:27:33.273 --> 01:27:39.229
If you live in the Beverly Center area,
stay inside and away from the windows.

01:27:39.323 --> 01:27:42.609
- Kelly Roark!
- Expect a series of explosions.

01:27:42.703 --> 01:27:45.907
- Kelly Roark!
- Beware of flying glass.

01:27:45.999 --> 01:27:48.669
Kelly! Kelly Roark!

01:27:48.752 --> 01:27:51.588
- Lou! Are you set?
- Ready.

01:27:51.673 --> 01:27:53.215
Danny, are you all ready?

01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:55.922
Here it comes.

01:27:56.012 --> 01:27:58.420
- Ten seconds away.
- You haven't got ten seconds!

01:27:59.975 --> 01:28:02.015
It's coming! It's coming!

01:28:04.022 --> 01:28:05.979
Everybody out! Everybody out!

01:28:06.067 --> 01:28:10.695
- Get outta here! Move it! Move it!
- Come on, come on!

01:28:10.781 --> 01:28:12.109
- Give me a hand!
- Put them in.

01:28:13.034 --> 01:28:14.612
We gotta move, buddy!

01:28:19.585 --> 01:28:21.376
It's gonna blow! It's gonna blow!

01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:35.011
I'm done!

01:28:59.137 --> 01:29:01.925
- Whoa!
- Where the...

01:29:02.016 --> 01:29:03.558
My God.

01:29:03.643 --> 01:29:06.015
This is just an incredible scene.

01:29:06.105 --> 01:29:09.309
We are watching a stampede desperately...

01:29:09.401 --> 01:29:10.646
Someone...

01:29:11.987 --> 01:29:13.066
Some...

01:29:31.805 --> 01:29:34.641
My leg. I think it's busted. Get me outta here.

01:29:38.689 --> 01:29:39.768
It's broken.

01:29:46.825 --> 01:29:49.530
Kelly Roark!

01:29:49.621 --> 01:29:52.326
Kelly Roark!

01:29:55.670 --> 01:29:56.416
Tommy.

01:29:56.964 --> 01:30:00.298
Start detonation sequence.

01:30:00.385 --> 01:30:01.665
Aaahh!

01:30:05.183 --> 01:30:06.642
It isn't gonna budge.

01:30:06.727 --> 01:30:10.476
- Get outta here. You'll make it, if you run.
- I won't leave a man down.

01:30:10.565 --> 01:30:12.772
I'm gonna get you outta here, pal.

01:30:15.363 --> 01:30:17.403
- La Cienega, we clear?
- La Cienega clear.

01:30:17.491 --> 01:30:19.899
- Lower San Vicente?
- Lower San Vicente all clear.

01:30:19.994 --> 01:30:22.485
- Upper San Vicente?
- Upper San Vicente all clear.

01:30:22.581 --> 01:30:24.455
Tower, can we go?

01:30:25.877 --> 01:30:28.451
We have to go. I repeat, are we clear?

01:30:28.547 --> 01:30:34.468
I got all hell breaking loose up here.
We gotta go now. I repeat, are we clear?

01:30:34.555 --> 01:30:36.464
- Tower clear.
- I copy.

01:30:38.101 --> 01:30:38.635
Go!

01:30:55.374 --> 01:30:58.660
Hold it. There's a kid out there.
There's a kid out there.

01:30:58.754 --> 01:31:01.506
There's a kid out there in San Vicente, hold it!

01:31:03.927 --> 01:31:04.757
Tommy!

01:31:06.973 --> 01:31:11.683
Get outta there! Kelly, get outta there!
Abort! Abort!

01:31:11.771 --> 01:31:13.645
Stop the explosions!

01:31:57.206 --> 01:31:59.329
A skyscraper20-storeys'high...

01:32:01.045 --> 01:32:02.041
Dad!

01:32:03.381 --> 01:32:05.504
Get out! Kelly, get outta there!

01:32:24.367 --> 01:32:28.033
As far as we can tell
through the clouds of rubble,

01:32:28.122 --> 01:32:30.792
this audacious plan seems to be working.

01:32:30.876 --> 01:32:34.827
Officials are breathing
their first sigh of relief in hours

01:32:34.923 --> 01:32:37.675
as this strategy looks like it's paying off.

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:41.379
In the triage area there is rejoicing.

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:42.967
Mike Roark?

01:32:45.312 --> 01:32:47.388
Mike Roark, are you there?

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.064
Mike?

01:32:50.151 --> 01:32:54.897
You can see through the dust
there is an atmosphere of celebration here.

01:32:54.991 --> 01:32:59.784
People are laughing and smiling,
feeling a sense of more than just relief.

01:32:59.873 --> 01:33:04.785
And about 200 feet away is a 20-storey
apartment building lying on its side...

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:06.955
Roark!

01:33:07.049 --> 01:33:09.042
Roark, can you hear me?

01:33:09.135 --> 01:33:09.965
Roark!

01:33:10.053 --> 01:33:12.805
Roark, can you hear me?

01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:15.678
Flow is at Crescent Heights and turning.

01:33:15.769 --> 01:33:17.845
The trench is holding.

01:33:17.938 --> 01:33:20.726
The flow is down the storm drain.

01:33:20.817 --> 01:33:24.151
The re-routing through the storm drains
seems to be holding.

01:33:26.783 --> 01:33:28.277
Roark!

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:30.197
Roark!

01:33:30.288 --> 01:33:34.239
- Approaching Wilshire intersection.
- Passing under the 10.

01:33:34.335 --> 01:33:37.502
We can see that fiery flow
moving along the creek.

01:33:37.589 --> 01:33:42.667
The concrete walls are holding up against
the lava as it streams towards the Pacific.

01:33:46.017 --> 01:33:47.808
Roark!

01:33:47.894 --> 01:33:49.353
Roark!

01:33:49.438 --> 01:33:51.514
Roark!

01:33:59.994 --> 01:34:02.117
Roark!

01:34:02.873 --> 01:34:04.498
Hey!

01:34:04.583 --> 01:34:06.457
- Roark!
- Over here!

01:34:39.546 --> 01:34:42.500
I just got word on Mike. He's OK.

01:34:42.592 --> 01:34:44.881
His little girl, too. Roark is OK.

01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:48.256
Thanks. Yes.

01:34:50.769 --> 01:34:53.058
And it is good news at last.

01:34:53.648 --> 01:34:56.733
Satellite pictures show
the volcano is shutting down.

01:34:56.819 --> 01:34:58.895
The lava is subsiding.

01:34:58.989 --> 01:35:03.034
This maybe the first chance
for stunned Angelinos to finally look around

01:35:03.119 --> 01:35:04.364
and take stock,

01:35:04.454 --> 01:35:08.749
for, with nearly 100 dead, thousands injured
and damage in the billions,

01:35:08.835 --> 01:35:12.454
this crisis has surely touched everyone of us.

01:35:12.548 --> 01:35:14.837
Let's go find your mom. What she look like?

01:35:16.011 --> 01:35:18.170
She looks like...

01:35:23.479 --> 01:35:25.057
Look at their faces.

01:35:27.568 --> 01:35:29.395
They all look the same.

01:35:48.387 --> 01:35:50.261
Yeah!

01:35:52.017 --> 01:35:53.297
Whoo!

01:36:03.407 --> 01:36:04.356
Well,

01:36:06.161 --> 01:36:09.744
had I been in charge,
I would have evacuated the West Side,

01:36:09.832 --> 01:36:14.578
sacrificed half the city, maybe made
parking a little easier in Beverly Hills, but

01:36:14.672 --> 01:36:16.166
I would have been wrong.

01:36:16.258 --> 01:36:20.303
If you'd been in charge, we'd have
known about it 24 hours in advance.

01:36:20.388 --> 01:36:22.048
You saved a lot of lives today.

01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:25.260
Aw, shucks, Roark.

01:36:36.785 --> 01:36:39.323
I let the guy outta my sight for one minute.

01:36:40.415 --> 01:36:44.116
Max, go! Go!

01:36:44.211 --> 01:36:47.248
Kelly, look who we brought you.

01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:50.507
- Max! Oh!
- Hey, Maxie.

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:57.642
- Just another day at the office, huh?
- Yeah!

01:36:57.729 --> 01:36:58.594
Mr. Roark!

01:36:58.689 --> 01:37:02.106
We've got a phone call for you.
It's Chief Sindelar.

01:37:02.193 --> 01:37:03.735
Yeah, just a moment.

01:37:03.821 --> 01:37:07.689
- He finally made it in, huh?
- Yeah.

01:37:07.784 --> 01:37:10.620
Says we got mud slides in Malibu.

01:37:10.705 --> 01:37:14.324
A couple of hundred structural fires,
power's down over half the city,

01:37:14.418 --> 01:37:18.499
gridlock on all of the freeways.
Hope you got some bright ideas for this.

01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:19.788
I do.

01:37:20.384 --> 01:37:22.922
You handle it. I'm on vacation.

01:37:23.013 --> 01:37:25.089
I'm going home with my daughter.

01:37:28.562 --> 01:37:29.558
Come on, Max!

01:37:30.690 --> 01:37:34.735
You know, I could get used to this, Mike.

01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:37.738
All right, let's go. Hello, Chief.

01:37:37.824 --> 01:37:39.318
No, it's still Emmit.

01:37:39.409 --> 01:37:44.701
I know. I don't know what to tell you. It's not
personal. Yes, it's raining here, too, sir.

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:47.366
Guys, it's a little wet out here. You want a lift?

01:37:47.462 --> 01:37:49.122
Yeah.

01:37:50.299 --> 01:37:54.511
Well, you said you wanted to go
to the Beverly Center. How did you like it?

01:37:54.596 --> 01:37:55.758
Huh?

01:37:55.848 --> 01:37:58.636
It was cool, Dad.

01:37:58.727 --> 01:38:00.803
- Cool?
- Cool.
