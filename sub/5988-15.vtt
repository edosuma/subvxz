WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.002
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.770
<i> CHRISTOPHE: You had</i>
<i> your daughter, Claude, beaten,</i>

00:04.772 --> 00:08.774
so that you could steal
the regency back.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.743
CATHERINE:
<i> And you are a murderer.</i>

00:10.745 --> 00:12.378
We are no longer lovers,
Christophe,

00:12.380 --> 00:15.180
just two people who keep
each other's secrets.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.449
If Rome could give me
a few more soldiers,

00:17.451 --> 00:19.585
I might actually be able
to take my country back

00:19.587 --> 00:22.054
from rebels like
the Protestant John Knox.

00:22.056 --> 00:25.057
We can help you buy an army.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.192
You and father
executed 13 knights

00:27.194 --> 00:28.594
simply because
you couldn't pay them.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.329
CATHERINE:<i> I'm under attack</i>
<i> by a rogue group</i>

00:30.331 --> 00:32.664
<i> calling themselves</i>
<i> the Red Knights.</i>

00:32.666 --> 00:34.333
General Gaghan,
we need the French Army

00:34.335 --> 00:36.468
to secure the throne.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.736
As soon as my soldiers
are fully paid

00:37.738 --> 00:39.238
for their service in Scotland.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.074
Then tell your generals
they will receive

00:42.076 --> 00:43.809
the money
their men are owed

00:43.811 --> 00:45.177
at the feast in their honor.

00:47.114 --> 00:48.447
(gasps)

00:56.757 --> 00:58.323
Oh, my God.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.560
Your generals.
Who did this?

01:01.562 --> 01:02.578
It was the Red Knights.

01:02.579 --> 01:03.595
They left their calling
card in my chambers.

01:03.597 --> 01:04.630
And they have poisoned

01:04.632 --> 01:06.365
every glass
except for ours.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.699
Which means they were able
to get inside the castle.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.169
I just bled
in a damned fighting pit

01:10.171 --> 01:11.804
to get these men the
gold they were owed.

01:11.806 --> 01:13.205
So they could finally
pay their soldiers

01:13.207 --> 01:14.540
for the Scottish campaign.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.308
BASH: And who will
believe that now?

01:16.310 --> 01:17.676
To the rest of your army,
it looks like

01:17.678 --> 01:19.211
you slaughtered the generals

01:19.213 --> 01:20.813
to avoid paying off
your military debts.

01:20.815 --> 01:22.181
He's right.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.415
This happened
under our roof.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.817
Charles and I will
be blamed for this.

01:24.819 --> 01:26.351
That's what
the Red Knights want.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.586
To frame you,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.321
so the army rises up
against the Valois,

01:29.323 --> 01:30.422
to incite rebellion.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.659
Then our task is simple.

01:33.661 --> 01:36.361
The soldiers must never
know this happened.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.763
No one can know.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.199
How do you keep nine
dead generals a secret?

01:40.201 --> 01:41.233
We bury the bodies.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.835
Who knew about this dinner?

01:42.837 --> 01:44.336
Well, countless people--
their wives, their friends,

01:44.338 --> 01:45.604
their secretaries.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.839
Those people knew
they were invited.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.574
Who knew they actually arrived?

01:48.576 --> 01:51.143
No one except us, really,
and a handful of servants.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.578
We need to keep
the servants quiet.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.480
Bash, gather them up.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.215
Offer them bribes
for their silence.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.717
If they refuse, tell them
I'll cut off their heads!

01:58.719 --> 02:01.286
Somehow I doubt
they'll refuse.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.188
My land's not
far from here.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.257
I have a place where we can
bury them discreetly.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.528
Catherine, listen to me.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.430
You are not
responsible for this.

02:11.432 --> 02:12.731
The Red Knights are,

02:12.733 --> 02:14.833
and they will pay
for what they have done.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.569
Until then, we must be
united in our story.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.305
The generals never arrived.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.840
And when word spreads
of their disappearance,

02:21.842 --> 02:24.209
which it will, we will be

02:24.211 --> 02:26.378
as shocked and disturbed
as everyone else.

02:27.414 --> 02:28.714
Let's get to work.

02:28.716 --> 02:29.781
Charles.

02:33.888 --> 02:35.454
¶ ¶

02:35.456 --> 02:36.889
MARY:
<i> Bash.</i>

02:36.891 --> 02:41.160
What you said earlier,
about coming to Scotland.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.862
It made me happy to think
of having you by my side,

02:43.864 --> 02:46.565
but now, both of our
circumstances have changed.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.467
The entire Valois family
is under attack.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.835
Mary,

02:49.836 --> 02:51.202
if you don't go back
to Scotland soon,

02:51.205 --> 02:52.471
John Knox
and his fellow Protestants

02:52.473 --> 02:53.639
will dissolve your throne.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.607
You'll lose your country.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.709
What happened to these generals
isn't your burden.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.611
Catherine and
her family are united.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.848
These knights will be crushed,
and life here will go on.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.817
You're right.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.920
My purpose lies elsewhere.

03:07.922 --> 03:11.190
But yours is here, in France.

03:11.192 --> 03:13.358
Charles and Claude
must be protected,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.794
and Margot and the younger ones
could return at any time.

03:15.796 --> 03:19.331
You should stay here
with your family.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.634
Very well.

03:22.636 --> 03:26.371
When you leave for Scotland,
I will stay behind.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.481
ELIZABETH: So what do
you suggest, General?

03:36.483 --> 03:37.683
Bringing the ships
in for maintenance

03:37.685 --> 03:39.568
at the end of the month.

03:39.569 --> 03:41.452
I can have them back on
the North Sea in a week's time.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.654
A week?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.256
Is it wise
to leave the North Sea

03:44.258 --> 03:45.624
unpatrolled for so long?

03:45.626 --> 03:47.392
NAVAL GENERAL:
We'll have no English ships

03:47.394 --> 03:49.394
to police for piracy, but
it's an acceptable risk.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.663
Your Majesty,

03:51.665 --> 03:54.600
our ships are deteriorating,
and if we don't attend to them,

03:54.602 --> 03:56.535
I fear they will
soon be beyond repair.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.604
It is a relatively
quiet time

03:58.606 --> 04:00.372
on the North Sea.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.741
I suppose a week
is a small price to pay

04:02.743 --> 04:04.276
to maintain our fleet.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.677
Fine, then.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.945
Bring them ashore.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.348
CATHERINE: Now, what of
the Southern Coast?

04:09.350 --> 04:12.351
That is a different story,
Your Majesty.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.953
The Spanish show no regard
for our trade routes.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.959
LOLA:<i> My dear friend,</i>
<i> how anxious you must be</i>

04:20.961 --> 04:24.563
<i> to return home at month's end.</i>

04:24.565 --> 04:28.300
<i> I was told</i>
<i> our cousins in Whitby,</i>

04:28.302 --> 04:30.836
<i> Muirfield and Eyemouth</i>
<i> gathered recently.</i>

04:30.838 --> 04:32.704
<i> Your father...</i>

04:32.706 --> 04:34.640
(distant laughter)

04:34.642 --> 04:37.776
<i> ...the good admiral,</i>
<i> could not be present.</i>

04:37.778 --> 04:40.512
<i> He'll be detained</i>
<i> for five to seven days.</i>

04:43.717 --> 04:45.684
(bell tolling)

04:45.686 --> 04:47.753
Charles,
I was looking for you.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.924
Delphine,
what are you doing here?

04:52.926 --> 04:55.794
It's good to see you, too, Bash.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.698
Of course, I, uh, just
wasn't expecting to see...

04:59.700 --> 05:02.000
I summoned her here to
return as my new court seer.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.535
We need her gifts.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.936
The Red Knights are
hiding amongst us,

05:04.938 --> 05:06.538
likely here in court.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.807
Delphine's touch
looks into men's hearts,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.809
revealing who is friend
and who is foe.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.912
Charles, can I have
a-a word alone with Delphine?

05:13.914 --> 05:16.548
Of course.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.756
I can't involve you
in this investigation.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.358
When you helped me
pursue the heart-killer,

05:26.360 --> 05:27.526
it nearly destroyed you.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.694
Bash, I am healed.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.596
And I'm ready
to start over.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.101
When I left court, you
promised you'd wait for me.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.370
Has something changed?

05:38.372 --> 05:40.038
What is it?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.640
Do you have feelings
for another?

05:41.642 --> 05:43.041
I'm sorry.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.644
I genuinely care for you,
but I-I can't deny...

05:45.646 --> 05:48.614
Then don't.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.583
I promised the king my help,
and I will keep my promise.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.761
Lord Narcisse.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.529
It's lord chancellor now.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.831
Catherine promoted me.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.599
Well, I am very happy for you.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.801
However,
I have a lot of work to do.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.436
I received a message
this morning from Lola,

06:11.438 --> 06:13.004
smuggled out of England
by our fellow Catholics.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.007
After the dozens of letters
that I've written my wife,

06:16.009 --> 06:17.976
that all went unanswered,
imagine my surprise

06:17.978 --> 06:21.113
when I realized this
was not a letter to me,

06:21.115 --> 06:22.914
but a coded message for you.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.157
Oh, she's naming
coastal towns.

06:32.159 --> 06:35.761
And mentions my father,
an admiral,

06:35.763 --> 06:38.830
who will be absent on
my return home at month's end.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.668
She's saying there's
a week when I can have

06:43.670 --> 06:45.070
safe passage across
the North Sea.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.038
When the English Navy
will not be

06:47.040 --> 06:48.473
patrolling the area.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.809
But this letter
was written days ago.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.978
If I want to cross the seas
without English interference,

06:52.980 --> 06:54.446
that means I'd have to leave...

06:54.448 --> 06:57.682
Now would be wise.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.752
It's really happening.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.990
Finally, after all these years.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.792
I'm going home.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.916
We're conducting searches
in every chamber

07:13.917 --> 07:15.100
to see if the poison
is still here.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.902
If we can find
the person responsible,

07:16.904 --> 07:19.838
maybe we can prevent
a rebellion.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.006
Christophe.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.474
You're supposed
to be on patrol.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.075
The queen regent asked for me.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.180
I thought you two were finished.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.915
The whims of a ruler.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.883
Right.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.085
Well, I'll leave you to it.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.159
I don't appreciate
you inviting yourself

07:41.161 --> 07:43.829
to my chambers publicly.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.096
And now is not a good time.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.531
Why not?

07:46.533 --> 07:48.233
Something wrong?
I'm fine.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.935
I overheard you planning
some kind of feast

07:49.937 --> 07:51.570
in the Great Hall
the other night.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.805
But you didn't call for servants
to clear it afterwards,

07:53.807 --> 07:55.674
which is odd.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.542
And you took a long time
to return to your chambers.

07:57.544 --> 07:58.710
Do you always
follow me?

07:58.712 --> 08:00.712
Tracking my every movement?

08:00.714 --> 08:03.048
It's a game I play sometimes
to keep my mind entertained.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.783
I pretend

08:04.785 --> 08:07.252
you are my prey,
but I don't kill you.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.589
I'm trying to be better,
so we can be close again.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.592
So you can tell me whatever
it is that's troubling you.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.060
Because I like to make a point

08:15.062 --> 08:17.262
of telling my blackmailer
everything.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.197
(chuckles)

08:19.199 --> 08:20.665
Come now.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.100
I'm more than
your blackmailer.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.035
Yes, you're a man
who murders for pleasure,

08:24.037 --> 08:25.637
as you've just reminded me.

08:25.639 --> 08:26.972
A killer with
a contingency letter

08:26.974 --> 08:28.540
hanging over my head,

08:28.542 --> 08:30.175
in case anything
should happen to you.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.210
You know my secrets.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.980
And I know yours.

08:34.982 --> 08:38.216
You had your own daughter
beaten to reclaim the regency.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.852
And I've gone so
long without a kill.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.255
I don't know why you rule out
a future for us.

08:43.257 --> 08:44.256
I don't.

08:44.258 --> 08:47.259
Please go away.

08:48.896 --> 08:52.531
Tell me why that feast
has you so anxious.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.232
And if you don't
tell me yourself,

08:54.234 --> 08:56.067
I'll find out on my own.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.840
Christophe, you know that thing
that you've always wanted to do?

09:01.842 --> 09:04.109
Well, stop asking questions,

09:04.111 --> 09:05.810
and I'll let you do it.

09:12.152 --> 09:15.120
Ambassador Blackburn,
as commanded,

09:15.122 --> 09:16.321
you dismantled the
marriage alliance

09:16.323 --> 09:17.923
between Queen Mary
and Don Carlos,

09:17.925 --> 09:20.659
extracted information
from the queen,

09:20.661 --> 09:23.695
and even helped Dudley foil an
assassination plot against me.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.999
You have proven
your loyalty to me,

09:28.001 --> 09:29.301
and your value.

09:29.303 --> 09:31.736
My loyalty is undying,
Your Majesty.

09:33.874 --> 09:37.008
But I must confess,
I am curious to how things ended

09:37.010 --> 09:38.944
between you
and the Scottish queen.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.613
She has a reputation
for bewitching men.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.884
Did you fall under Mary's spell?

09:45.886 --> 09:47.786
Honestly?

09:47.788 --> 09:50.355
There were times where I could
envision falling in love

09:50.357 --> 09:53.358
with the queen of Scots,
but not in this life.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.961
You are my queen.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.296
I was born an Englishman
and I will die an Englishman.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.233
I have decided
to reward your service

10:02.235 --> 10:03.969
with a position here at court.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.804
I will be giving you
the chance to work

10:05.806 --> 10:07.839
closely with me from now on.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.077
Do not make me
regret that choice.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.012
You won't, Your Majesty.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.051
BASH: They could strike
at any moment.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.386
Bash.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.388
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.323
I'm sorry
I've been so busy.

10:25.325 --> 10:29.260
The castle is on high alert
because of the Red Knights.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.830
You seem uneasy.
What's wrong?

10:31.832 --> 10:34.132
Last night, when I was walking
the castle halls alone,

10:34.134 --> 10:35.967
I felt something.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.003
It wasn't these
Red Knights.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.739
Bash, I think the killer
we sought is still alive.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.707
I felt him right here

10:42.709 --> 10:44.009
inside the castle with us.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.276
Are you sure?

10:45.278 --> 10:46.711
He was caught and executed.

10:46.713 --> 10:48.213
I know, but last night,
I felt him.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.116
His hands were tightening
around a woman's bare throat.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.884
So you're saying
a woman was strangled?

10:52.886 --> 10:55.854
No. He didn't kill her.

10:55.855 --> 10:58.823
He didn't want to because
this woman protects him somehow.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.291
He needs her.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.161
My lord, the queen regent
is asking for you.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.163
Urgently.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.666
(sighs) I appreciate
your telling me this.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.100
I have to go
help Catherine,

11:09.102 --> 11:10.769
but wait for me
in your chambers,

11:10.771 --> 11:12.037
and we'll look into this,

11:12.039 --> 11:14.039
after I deal
with these Red Knights.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.874
Of course.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.311
Uh, Catherine, there's
something you need to know.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.814
I'll be returning to Scotland
sooner than I had planned.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.049
Well, how much sooner?

11:24.051 --> 11:25.784
I'm mobilizing
my forces now.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.318
Why now?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.721
Lola sent me
some critical information.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.056
There's only a small window

11:31.058 --> 11:33.391
in which the English Navy
cannot stop me.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.795
But I-I know you're dealing
with your own crisis.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.997
I have the situation
under control.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.401
No need to feel guilty
about leaving.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.937
I've buried the bodies.
I've bribed the witnesses.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.138
The soldiers that served
the generals

11:47.140 --> 11:48.339
will be arriving imminently,

11:48.341 --> 11:49.808
and when they do,
I will simply

11:49.810 --> 11:52.410
explain that their superiors
never appeared.

11:52.412 --> 11:56.081
I will pay them the gold, and
France will have a loyal army

11:56.083 --> 11:59.284
to defend us against
these so-called knights.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.019
It seems you've thought
of everything.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.220
Well, I know you'll...

12:02.222 --> 12:03.888
(woman screaming in distance)

12:03.890 --> 12:05.924
PALACE GUARD:
It came from outside!

12:05.926 --> 12:07.425
Quickly, to the courtyard!

12:07.427 --> 12:08.960
PALACE GUARD:
Quickly!

12:08.962 --> 12:11.963
(crowd clamoring)

12:11.965 --> 12:14.299
Oh, God. The generals.

12:15.469 --> 12:18.269
Guards... guards,
take them down!

12:18.271 --> 12:20.038
Remove them immediately!

12:20.040 --> 12:21.439
Yes, Your Majesty.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.008
(guards shouting)

12:24.010 --> 12:26.211
(horses neighing)

12:28.248 --> 12:29.447
PALACE GUARD:
Secure the gates!

12:29.449 --> 12:30.415
Catherine.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.219
It's too late.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.957
Whoa. Whoa.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.893
They've murdered our brothers,
our generals!

12:41.895 --> 12:42.961
Down with the Valois!

12:42.963 --> 12:44.896
Murderers!

12:44.898 --> 12:46.931
They're going to tell
every soldier in France

12:46.933 --> 12:48.967
that I'm responsible
for this atrocity.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.268
SOLDIER:
Move out!

12:50.270 --> 12:51.269
Move out, back to camp!

12:51.271 --> 12:53.371
(soldiers shouting)

12:53.373 --> 12:55.240
And if they band together,
they'll destroy you.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.282
You said that
you buried the bodies!

13:04.284 --> 13:06.017
Instead, their heads
end up on pikes.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.152
How did this happen?!

13:07.154 --> 13:08.453
The Red Knights must
have followed us

13:08.455 --> 13:10.789
the night we left the
castle and dug them up.

13:10.791 --> 13:14.125
France's military thinks
that I have murdered their own.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.027
This is how revolutions begin.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.562
A disenfranchised army

13:17.564 --> 13:19.564
turns against its rulers.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.066
If you tell the truth, the
soldiers may listen to reason.

13:22.068 --> 13:25.303
You could try to sate
them with the gold,

13:25.305 --> 13:28.039
but if you want my counsel
as lord chancellor,

13:28.041 --> 13:29.307
you need reinforcements

13:29.309 --> 13:31.075
to defend the castle.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.878
And Mary has an army of
mercenaries not far from here.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.113
You know that Mary is sailing

13:35.115 --> 13:36.881
into a hostile nation
of Protestants.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.383
She must leave immediately.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.385
She needs her mercenaries
for her own protection.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.287
If this situation explodes,
it is better for Mary

13:42.289 --> 13:43.555
to incur losses than you.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.292
You really do despise her.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.894
She sent my son
to his death.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.896
He may not have been
a son to be proud of,

13:51.898 --> 13:53.398
but he was mine,
nevertheless.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.533
And when Lola had doubts
about my commitment to her,

13:55.535 --> 13:57.535
it was Mary who fanned
the flames of our discord,

13:57.537 --> 13:59.437
driving her
across the channel to England.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.373
So, no, I do not care for her.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.845
Catherine,

14:06.847 --> 14:08.513
you are fighting a war

14:08.515 --> 14:10.315
of your own now,
and you cannot afford

14:10.317 --> 14:12.350
to protect Mary any longer.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.557
(door opens, closes)

14:19.559 --> 14:21.926
Queen Mary.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.596
As you intend to race off
to Scotland, I'm curious:

14:24.598 --> 14:26.331
what will you do about Lola?

14:26.333 --> 14:27.432
What do you mean?

14:27.434 --> 14:29.000
She's still in England.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.268
And once your
military campaign

14:30.270 --> 14:32.237
to reclaim your Scottish throne
goes public,

14:32.239 --> 14:34.639
well, I don't imagine
Elizabeth will react well.

14:34.641 --> 14:38.042
Are you really playing the
concerned husband now?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.044
You are Elizabeth's rival.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.880
Once you're ruling
on England's borders,

14:41.882 --> 14:44.482
then Lola's value as a hostage
increases tenfold.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.919
Elizabeth will keep
my wife captive forever.

14:47.921 --> 14:51.256
But I don't suppose that even
crossed your mind, did it?

14:51.258 --> 14:53.191
Actually, it did.

14:53.192 --> 14:55.125
And while you've been
chasing power here in France,

14:55.128 --> 14:58.663
I have already set into motion
a plan to return Lola home,

14:58.665 --> 15:00.665
before I reach
Scotland.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.334
And what exactly have you done,
Lord Chancellor?

15:03.336 --> 15:05.203
Lola wants nothing
to do with me.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.471
Oh, so that's it, then.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.072
You've just given up
on the woman

15:08.074 --> 15:09.941
you vowed to spend
the rest of your life with.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.409
I love my wife.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.478
No, you love power.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.547
Time and again,

15:15.548 --> 15:17.615
you've proven that power
is what you most desire.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.952
And that is why you lost her.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.220
You want to judge my choices?

15:22.222 --> 15:24.155
Do you?

15:24.157 --> 15:27.091
As you run off
to reclaim your throne,

15:27.093 --> 15:30.161
you are throwing
Catherine to the wolves.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.565
I can see just how much
she means to you.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.305
(knocking on door)

15:41.708 --> 15:43.508
Ambassador Blackburn.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.976
Lady Lola. You remember me.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.377
Yes. You extended

15:46.379 --> 15:49.047
Elizabeth's invitation
for me to visit England.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.615
I've been visiting ever since.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.450
(chuckles softly)

15:52.452 --> 15:55.153
I was hoping we could
have a private word.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.691
Would you take John
to the stables?

16:01.494 --> 16:02.660
He loves to see the horses.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.462
Hmm.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.001
Is it about Mary?

16:10.003 --> 16:11.002
Is she all right?

16:11.004 --> 16:12.003
She's fine.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.538
This is actually about you.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.707
I gave my word to Mary
that when I returned

16:15.709 --> 16:17.675
to England,
I would help to free you.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.043
Of course,

16:19.045 --> 16:21.079
it will take time.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.548
And this was Mary's request?

16:23.550 --> 16:25.416
You have every right
to be cautious,

16:25.418 --> 16:28.086
considering I work for
Elizabeth, but you should know,

16:28.088 --> 16:30.755
Mary did much for me
during my time at French court.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.326
Elizabeth held my daughter
Agatha as leverage.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.462
Mary helped me get her back.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.564
And when the Catholic Church
threatened to send me

16:39.566 --> 16:41.299
to the gallows,
your friend and queen

16:41.301 --> 16:42.667
helped save my life.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.771
I owe her everything.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.773
You care for her.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.708
I killed a man
to protect her.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.679
So believe me when I say
I'm on Mary's side, and yours.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.316
You have a friend here.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.287
Very well.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.689
If you can find

17:04.691 --> 17:07.358
me and my son a way out of here,
we will take it.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.295
(door opens, closes)

17:11.297 --> 17:13.297
I've decided to stay in France.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.233
What?

17:15.235 --> 17:17.035
For a while
longer, anyway.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.371
You may face an attack
from your own military,

17:20.373 --> 17:23.741
so I've decided to use
my mercenaries to protect you.

17:23.743 --> 17:27.445
Until the threat of
a revolt has passed.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.480
I'll find another way
to get back to Scotland.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.350
Catherine, we have to focus.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.485
We? I've already told you once,

17:34.487 --> 17:35.820
I have this under control.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.356
France will handle
this threat alone.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.724
Catherine,

17:39.726 --> 17:41.659
royals fall when their armies
turn against them.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.127
So you're going to sacrifice

17:43.129 --> 17:44.662
your Scottish throne
for France, is that it?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.631
Have you learned nothing?

17:46.633 --> 17:48.666
This country has already
sacrificed too much

17:48.668 --> 17:50.168
on Scotland's behalf.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.203
You mustn't make
the same mistake now.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.239
We both know that
safe passage to Scotland

17:55.241 --> 17:56.374
may never come again.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.742
And you need
your mercenaries

17:57.744 --> 17:59.577
to protect you
against the Protestants.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.346
Men who are dissolving
your throne as we speak.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.748
But you need help.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.816
I need you to go.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.651
The more we try

18:06.653 --> 18:08.686
to help each other,
the more harm we do.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.354
You must see that now.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.759
It is time that we move forth
on our own,

18:14.761 --> 18:16.828
as queens of separate nations.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.232
You're right.

18:21.234 --> 18:24.735
I can't afford
to risk my future for you.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.473
But after all
we've been through...

18:29.676 --> 18:32.343
...is this how you want
to say good-bye?

18:34.180 --> 18:35.546
Having you here,

18:35.548 --> 18:38.516
it has kept some part
of Francis alive for me.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.520
Saying good-bye...

18:45.458 --> 18:48.459
...it's like having to say
good-bye to him all over again.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.796
You must go home
and reclaim your throne.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.699
Your destiny lies in Scotland.
It always has.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.902
And I will not stand
in the way of it.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.507
Go take back your country.

19:04.344 --> 19:07.812
What will you do if the
soldiers come for you?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.514
I will figure something out.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.682
I always do.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.886
(door opens, closes)

19:16.489 --> 19:18.456
Send word once you've
arrived in Edinburgh.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.291
I will, Your Majesty.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.462
I take it you couldn't
convince Catherine

19:24.464 --> 19:25.796
to accept your help.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.332
No. Stubborn till
the very end.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.700
Take care of her,
won't you?

19:32.272 --> 19:34.405
I remember when
I first came here.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.507
Stepping out
of the carriage,

19:36.509 --> 19:38.743
everyone lined up
to welcome me.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.511
I was so nervous.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.280
But at least
I had my friends:

19:42.282 --> 19:44.615
Kenna, Aylee, Greer, Lola.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.851
And then I saw you
and Francis...

19:49.255 --> 19:51.189
...and somehow I knew
that everything

19:51.191 --> 19:53.424
was going to be all right.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.727
Now I'm leaving alone.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.462
It's just

19:58.464 --> 20:00.798
not what I imagined.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.800
I have something for you.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.369
Before he died,

20:05.371 --> 20:07.371
Francis asked me
to give this to you

20:07.373 --> 20:08.940
the day you left
for Scotland.

20:08.942 --> 20:11.876
Thank you, Bash.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.646
I'm not ready
to open it just yet.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.515
Please put it in the carriage.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.252
You've been a true friend
to me, Bash.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.720
More than a friend.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.689
My family.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.325
Good-bye, Mary.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.797
I will miss you, Bash.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.934
(sighs)

20:42.976 --> 20:45.243
¶ ¶

21:06.032 --> 21:08.299
Queen Elizabeth.
You sent for me?

21:08.301 --> 21:12.270
I just received this letter
from John Knox.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.704
He and his Protestant
lords in Scotland

21:13.706 --> 21:14.972
are looking to dissolve
Mary's throne.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.974
And he's asking me,

21:16.976 --> 21:18.709
as a fellow Protestant,
to help support him

21:18.711 --> 21:20.978
when Mary's Catholic
followers resist.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.414
Elizabeth,
you cannot be on his side,

21:23.416 --> 21:25.783
no matter how badly you want
to weaken your rival.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.019
His hatred of women in power
is unparalleled.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.589
But you already know that.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.958
And you know that
I would never advise you

21:33.960 --> 21:35.526
to do something against Mary,

21:35.528 --> 21:37.962
so why are you
bringing this to me?

21:37.964 --> 21:39.563
I'd like some advice.

21:39.565 --> 21:40.731
From me?

21:40.733 --> 21:42.066
Yes.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.303
I don't like John Knox,

21:45.305 --> 21:49.307
and I want to refuse him,
as you so passionately suggest,

21:49.309 --> 21:50.541
but he'd make
an unpleasant enemy,

21:50.543 --> 21:52.543
and I don't want
to ask the other men

21:52.545 --> 21:54.345
on my council for advice.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.414
So I'm asking you,

21:56.416 --> 22:00.418
as a woman and as a Scot:
how do I say no to him

22:00.420 --> 22:03.554
without making him my enemy
and alienating

22:03.556 --> 22:05.356
my Protestant supporters
in Scotland?

22:05.358 --> 22:07.958
Allies he essentially controls.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.495
Perhaps it's best
to outright refuse him.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.064
Be brutal and direct.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.832
Or you simply don't answer.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.367
If you refuse
John Knox,

22:16.369 --> 22:19.036
as you suggest, it tells him
you are a decisive

22:19.038 --> 22:21.772
and formidable ruler
who will not be bullied.

22:21.774 --> 22:22.840
Which I am.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.642
Which is what
he really hates.

22:24.644 --> 22:25.976
So stall.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.978
Avoid a decision
he can rail against.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.648
Let him think you are
indecisive, innocuous...

22:30.650 --> 22:32.583
Feminine.
Tell him you
need to consult

22:32.585 --> 22:34.518
with your advisors,
search your heart

22:34.520 --> 22:36.887
and read the Scriptures--
he'll like that part.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.424
Lady Lola...

22:40.426 --> 22:41.692
(liquid pouring)

22:41.694 --> 22:45.396
...I'm truly impressed.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.598
I will take your advice.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.603
I heard Elizabeth sent for you.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.938
Is everything all right?

22:53.940 --> 22:55.606
Elizabeth just asked
for my advice,

22:55.608 --> 22:56.807
and she's taking it.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.476
I have her ear, Gideon.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.677
She's starting
to trust me.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.078
Elizabeth is a Tudor.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.563
And like her father,

23:02.564 --> 23:04.047
she has a habit of turning
on those she trusts.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.384
The closer you get,
the more dangerous she becomes.

23:06.386 --> 23:07.651
And yet, think of
what my relationship

23:07.653 --> 23:09.453
with her could
mean for Mary.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.389
Tell me you're not having
second thoughts about leaving.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.723
Of course not.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.126
When you can get me out of here,
I will flee.

23:15.128 --> 23:17.762
But while I'm here,
I'm helping Mary.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.930
Do you realize that
she might be on her way

23:19.932 --> 23:21.465
to Scotland as we speak,

23:21.467 --> 23:23.167
because of information
I acquired?

23:23.169 --> 23:25.536
What kind of information?

23:25.538 --> 23:28.172
I overheard that the North Sea
is unpatrolled as of now.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.541
That makes your situation
even more urgent.

23:30.543 --> 23:33.043
If Mary's headed to Scotland,
she will have an army with her,

23:33.045 --> 23:34.445
courtesy of the Vatican.

23:34.447 --> 23:36.180
Well, yes, I assumed as much.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.082
Elizabeth will
feel threatened.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.718
And when Mary lands on
Scottish soil with armed forces,

23:40.720 --> 23:42.420
you become
a more valuable hostage.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.687
And Elizabeth
might decide

23:43.689 --> 23:45.589
to keep you and your son
here indefinitely.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.658
We don't have as much
time as I'd hoped.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.827
You need to work faster
on my escape.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.062
Whatever you have to do,
whomever you have to bribe,

23:52.064 --> 23:53.130
do it.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.038
I'll have you moved to your new
chambers once they're ready.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.107
You'll find
I spared no expense.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.443
My royal seer
deserves only the best.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.878
You've been very kind
to me, Your Majesty.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.880
We all remember
what you did for Francis.

24:09.882 --> 24:12.049
Those extra few days
we spent with him,

24:12.051 --> 24:13.918
they meant the world
to my family.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.920
I gladly serve the Valois.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.756
And I'll do whatever I can
to help unmask these Red Knights

24:18.758 --> 24:20.658
who hide in your midst.

24:25.998 --> 24:28.566
(door closes)

24:31.771 --> 24:33.237
(gasps)

24:35.508 --> 24:37.074
Your Majesty!

24:39.512 --> 24:41.212
Oh, forgive me.

24:41.214 --> 24:42.980
You should be
more careful, miss.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.785
Oh, it's you!

24:47.787 --> 24:49.220
(muffled scream)

24:50.890 --> 24:52.690
(gasping)

24:55.094 --> 24:57.027
Shh.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.763
Shh. Shh.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.773
I shouldn't have
brought her here.

25:09.775 --> 25:13.244
This is my fault.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.695
"Death to all friends
of the Valois."

25:31.697 --> 25:33.631
Charles, you shouldn't be here.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.099
It's the Red Knights.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.001
They killed Delphine before
she could expose them.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.870
Please take the king back to his
chambers and guard him closely.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.972
Were there no witnesses?
No, my lord.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.140
Christophe found her body

25:43.142 --> 25:44.275
and alerted us.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.818
(panting)

25:57.890 --> 25:59.957
Catherine.

25:59.959 --> 26:03.661
Too many terrible things
have happened today.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.729
I'm so sorry Sebastian.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.932
I know how dear that
Delphine was to you.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.133
She didn't deserve this.

26:09.135 --> 26:12.336
Catherine. Your neck.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.738
What happened?
Who did that to you?

26:14.740 --> 26:16.607
I'm fine.
Were you attacked?

26:16.609 --> 26:18.108
Those bruises can't be
more than a day old.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.610
Let it go, Sebastian.

26:19.612 --> 26:20.744
Why?

26:20.746 --> 26:22.246
Are you protecting someone?

26:22.248 --> 26:25.282
You're involved
with Christophe again.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.283
Did he do that to you?

26:26.285 --> 26:27.885
It was consensual.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.020
He's not trying to kill me.
He merely...

26:30.022 --> 26:31.755
He tightens his hands
around my throat.

26:31.757 --> 26:32.957
It increases the sensation.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.224
He's not going to harm

26:34.226 --> 26:35.859
a queen who ensures his station.

26:35.861 --> 26:37.027
He needs me.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.896
It's fine. I'm fine.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.164
Queen regent.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.832
One of the lieutenants
who served

26:41.834 --> 26:42.967
General Gaghan is here.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.335
He wants to speak
with you at once.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.839
Excuse me.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.318
Lieutenant Gambon.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.088
I am so sorry
for your loss.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.790
I want to assure you
that the Valois

27:06.792 --> 27:08.926
were not behind the murder
of General Gaghan,

27:08.928 --> 27:11.128
or the other generals
who were slaughtered.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.063
CHARLES: We'd like to thank
you for coming here today

27:13.065 --> 27:15.366
to speak with us
in the wake of this tragedy.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.801
We came to collect the bodies
of our fallen generals.

27:17.803 --> 27:20.004
And to demand that
you surrender your person

27:20.006 --> 27:22.072
to a military tribunal.
I beg your pardon?

27:22.074 --> 27:23.374
You murdered our superiors

27:23.376 --> 27:25.676
to avoid paying the debt
for our armed service.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.344
CHARLES:
My mother did no such thing.

27:27.346 --> 27:30.364
There's a conspiracy.
She's been framed.

27:30.365 --> 27:33.383
Lieutenant, there are sinister
forces working against me.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.753
And that is why I called
the generals here.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.821
You will have
your chance to explain.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.957
In one hour, I shall return
with the rest of the men.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.358
More than a hundred
armed soldiers

27:41.360 --> 27:43.093
will convene outside your gates.

27:43.095 --> 27:46.163
I have the gold and I can
pay you what you're owed.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.998
It's not about gold anymore.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.384
We want justice.

27:50.385 --> 27:52.769
You talk of justice
while you threaten your regent.

27:52.772 --> 27:55.372
With respect, Your Majesty,
the queen struck the first blow.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.707
If she does not surrender,

27:56.709 --> 27:57.975
we will strike back,

27:57.977 --> 28:00.244
and this castle
will burn to ashes.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.729
We've nearly finished
getting the supplies aboard.

28:18.731 --> 28:20.297
Based on the timetable
you've laid out,

28:20.299 --> 28:22.966
in order to cross the seas
before the English navy return,

28:22.968 --> 28:24.435
we should leave immediately.

28:38.984 --> 28:40.984
FRANCIS:
<i> My dearest Mary,</i>

28:40.986 --> 28:42.986
<i> if you're reading this,</i>
<i> then you are leaving France</i>

28:42.988 --> 28:44.855
<i> to reclaim</i>
<i> your Scottish throne.</i>

28:44.857 --> 28:46.790
<i> I always knew</i>
<i> this day would come,</i>

28:46.792 --> 28:49.359
<i> and I wish I could be</i>
<i> at your side as you set sail</i>

28:49.361 --> 28:52.062
<i> to take back what is yours.</i>

28:52.064 --> 28:54.498
<i> In the darkest of times,</i>
<i> you were my conscience.</i>

28:54.500 --> 28:56.200
<i> Your heart was a light, Mary,</i>

28:56.202 --> 28:59.103
<i> and it burned so very bright</i>
<i> for France.</i>

28:59.105 --> 29:03.073
<i> No matter how far you go,</i>
<i> that light will burn forever.</i>

29:03.075 --> 29:05.008
<i> I have left you a gift,</i>

29:05.010 --> 29:07.344
<i> something I made for you</i>
<i> to fight for what is yours,</i>

29:07.346 --> 29:12.149
<i> and for what you know</i>
<i> in your heart is right.</i>

29:12.151 --> 29:15.519
<i> I love you, Mary Stuart.</i>
<i> Forever.</i>

29:23.963 --> 29:26.163
(sniffles)

29:38.511 --> 29:39.810
Captain.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.812
Gather the men.

29:41.814 --> 29:42.980
We're going back to the castle,

29:42.982 --> 29:44.348
and we must be prepared
for a fight.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.349
Queen Mary,

29:45.351 --> 29:46.817
time is precious,

29:46.819 --> 29:48.352
and so are your soldiers.

29:48.354 --> 29:49.920
You can't afford
to risk them now.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.789
I gave you an order.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.957
Tell the men we are going back.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.261
I have one more thing
I have to do.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.243
(exhales)

30:13.245 --> 30:14.311
(wood creaks)

30:16.215 --> 30:17.948
Bash.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.082
What are you doing here?

30:19.084 --> 30:20.884
Before she was murdered,

30:20.886 --> 30:23.253
Delphine warned me the heart-
killer might still be alive.

30:23.255 --> 30:26.256
She sensed his presence
here in this very castle.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.559
She felt his hands tightening
around a woman's throat,

30:28.561 --> 30:30.527
a woman who
protected him.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.564
I saw the bruises
on Catherine's neck.

30:33.566 --> 30:35.499
Bash, I'm sorry for your loss.

30:36.402 --> 30:37.401
(screams)

30:37.403 --> 30:39.002
(groans)

30:39.004 --> 30:40.537
(screams)

30:40.539 --> 30:42.172
It was you all along.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.274
You are a liar and a murderer.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.276
You're insane!
I am a kingsguard!

30:46.278 --> 30:47.978
You were.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.012
Thanks to Catherine.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.247
As the king's deputy,

30:50.249 --> 30:52.082
I'm relieving you of your duty.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.153
(screams)

30:56.155 --> 30:57.955
Catherine was protecting you.

30:58.591 --> 31:00.858
(groans)
How much did she know?

31:02.528 --> 31:05.262
She knew everything.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.031
I had information on her,
leverage.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.567
It's all written down in
a letter, my crimes and hers.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.037
You let me live,
I'll tell you where it is.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.039
It's enough to strip her
of the regency?

31:16.041 --> 31:17.341
Yes.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.410
Then we're agreed.

31:20.412 --> 31:21.979
The letter's being held
in the village,

31:21.981 --> 31:23.914
at a tavern just east
of the Blood Wood.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.884
(crying):
I think I need a tourniquet.

31:26.886 --> 31:27.584
Why?

31:28.587 --> 31:30.420
So you can kill again?

31:32.925 --> 31:34.358
I don't think so.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.194
(gurgling)

31:37.196 --> 31:38.562
(exhales)

31:41.634 --> 31:43.267
We don't have enough guards

31:43.269 --> 31:45.302
to defend the castle
if those soldiers attack.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.603
That won't happen.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.505
I won't let anyone
harm my family.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.174
I plan to address my
accusers directly,

31:51.176 --> 31:53.977
pay them, and tell them
I'm not their enemy.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.113
GUARD: Make way for the queen
regent. Make way for the king.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.949
GAMBON:
Queen Catherine!

31:58.951 --> 32:01.251
Open the gates
and surrender!

32:01.253 --> 32:02.452
If you come quietly,

32:02.454 --> 32:04.955
you have my word,
no family member

32:04.957 --> 32:06.089
will be harmed.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.491
If you kill me,

32:07.493 --> 32:10.060
the true murderers
will roam free.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.495
I know you men are angry, but...

32:11.497 --> 32:12.963
Open the gate!

32:12.965 --> 32:15.365
Stand down.
Everyone stand down!

32:15.367 --> 32:16.500
I'm going out there.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.502
Stephan, take Charles
back inside

32:18.504 --> 32:20.337
and barricade the doors.
Yes.

32:20.339 --> 32:21.972
I'll talk them down.
Your Majesty.

32:23.208 --> 32:24.658
Charles, go.

32:24.659 --> 32:26.109
(men yelling in distance)
GUARD: Hold the gate!

32:27.212 --> 32:29.112
(horses approaching)

32:29.114 --> 32:31.181
What the hell is that? Men!

32:31.183 --> 32:33.150
My lord!
Yes, my lord!

32:34.987 --> 32:37.054
(men yelling in distance)

32:42.461 --> 32:43.994
Ho.

32:49.234 --> 32:50.667
Draw!
Draw your weapons!

32:50.669 --> 32:53.203
To arms!

32:54.540 --> 32:56.473
What are they doing?
Don't know.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.008
Why is she riding?
Who is it?

32:58.010 --> 32:59.209
Make way.
Let her through.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.012
Who is it?

33:02.014 --> 33:03.347
Move! Move!

33:10.556 --> 33:12.756
I am Mary Stuart,
Queen of Scots.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.624
Who is your commander?

33:17.696 --> 33:19.629
Order your men to stand down.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.331
Queen Mary,

33:21.333 --> 33:23.633
we fought on your behalf
in Scotland,

33:23.635 --> 33:25.502
and now you ride
against us.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.771
I have come
to defend the queen regent

33:27.773 --> 33:29.306
because she did not

33:29.308 --> 33:30.474
kill your generals.

33:30.476 --> 33:31.575
Listen to me,

33:31.577 --> 33:33.076
all of you!

33:33.078 --> 33:35.779
Queen Catherine is innocent.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.481
There is a secret faction

33:37.483 --> 33:39.716
working against the Valois.

33:39.718 --> 33:44.454
Murderers who seek to frame
Catherine, France's regent,

33:44.456 --> 33:46.456
and plunge the realm

33:46.458 --> 33:48.658
into chaos and terror.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.328
If you turn against her,

33:51.330 --> 33:53.363
you turn against France.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.199
And I will fight you
like I would fight them.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.401
To the death.

33:57.403 --> 33:58.735
(soldiers murmuring)

34:00.406 --> 34:04.107
I am asking you, as Frenchmen,

34:04.109 --> 34:06.476
to make the right
choice today.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.678
Catherine is still your queen.

34:08.680 --> 34:12.215
France is still your country,
your home,

34:12.217 --> 34:14.551
as it has been mine
since I was a child.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.320
This is our country!

34:17.322 --> 34:19.689
We cannot afford
to let it burn.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.625
We must listen
to our conscience

34:21.627 --> 34:24.161
and make the right choice.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.632
So choose now.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.436
(soldiers murmuring)

34:38.610 --> 34:40.410
For France.
Arms down.

34:41.613 --> 34:43.780
For the queen.
For you, my queen.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.315
Fall back.
Back to camp.

34:46.785 --> 34:49.486
(soldiers shouting orders)

34:49.488 --> 34:51.755
They're leaving.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.327
(sighs)

34:57.329 --> 35:00.530
Mary, she... she saved you.

35:00.532 --> 35:03.500
(sighs)

35:11.410 --> 35:13.477
Hyah!
(horse neighs)

35:21.653 --> 35:24.588
See that everything's secure.

35:24.590 --> 35:28.191
Catherine. I heard
about Christophe.

35:28.193 --> 35:29.559
You all right?

35:29.561 --> 35:31.461
Oh, I'm fine.
I mean, it was a shock.

35:31.463 --> 35:34.397
Bash said that he murdered
that poor Delphine.

35:34.399 --> 35:37.334
He was the one behind those
gruesome heart-slayings.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.668
Well, your taste
in men always did leave

35:38.670 --> 35:39.903
something to be desired.

35:39.905 --> 35:40.904
Hmm.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.606
I find myself

35:42.608 --> 35:44.641
grateful to have you
by my side these days.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.344
You are the only
man that I...

35:47.346 --> 35:48.512
Catherine.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.614
I'm leaving France.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.249
Why?

35:52.251 --> 35:53.817
Well, the crisis is averted.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.252
The military have backed down.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.786
Why? Really.

35:56.788 --> 36:00.891
Recently, the queen of Scots

36:00.893 --> 36:03.660
accused me of being
a selfish husband,

36:03.662 --> 36:05.762
of caring too much
for my station--

36:05.764 --> 36:08.498
more than
the safety of my wife.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.734
I'm leaving to free Lola.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.302
Because of what Mary said?

36:12.304 --> 36:13.703
Not just.
Mm-hmm.

36:13.705 --> 36:17.474
It's also because you and I

36:17.476 --> 36:19.676
work very well
together, Catherine.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.844
Hmm.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.846
Too well.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.649
I want to go now.
I want to fight for Lola.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.217
I want to save her.

36:27.219 --> 36:29.186
I want to save what we shared

36:29.188 --> 36:32.355
before our union is
damaged beyond repair.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.658
Damaged by me? By us?

36:34.660 --> 36:35.759
Yes.

36:35.761 --> 36:38.395
That is the most
flattering thing

36:38.397 --> 36:40.597
that you have ever said to me.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.501
I shall return.

36:45.938 --> 36:48.471
Safe travels,
Lord Chancellor.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.541
Until we meet again.

37:00.586 --> 37:01.985
(chuckles):
Sebastian,

37:01.987 --> 37:04.287
what are you doing
sitting at<i> my</i> desk?

37:04.289 --> 37:06.590
You were protecting Christophe.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.558
And I know why.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.859
What are you
talking about?

37:09.861 --> 37:11.861
You paid Duke Boinel
to attack Claude.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.731
All so you could take the
regency from Narcisse.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.466
That's what Christophe
held over you.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.335
Well, that is nonsense.
Who told you that?

37:18.337 --> 37:19.803
Oh, Sebastian,
you don't believe...

37:19.805 --> 37:21.605
You knew he was a murderer
and you protected him.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.607
All so he would
keep your secrets.

37:23.609 --> 37:24.874
You allowed him

37:24.876 --> 37:27.744
to continue to roam these halls
as a kingsguard!

37:27.746 --> 37:28.845
Delphine
(pounds on table)

37:28.847 --> 37:29.980
is dead because of you!

37:29.982 --> 37:32.132
Don't you dare

37:32.133 --> 37:34.283
lay that poor girl's death
at my feet.

37:34.286 --> 37:37.287
How can you take the word
of a madman over mine?

37:37.289 --> 37:38.822
Sebastian, we are family.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.457
I have been like...

37:40.459 --> 37:42.592
Like a mother to me.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.894
When Francis died,
I felt so alone,

37:44.896 --> 37:46.496
I reached out to my real mother.

37:46.498 --> 37:47.631
I sent letters to Diane

37:47.633 --> 37:49.699
at all of her chateaus.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.601
She never wrote back.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.604
When I realized what she'd
done to your daughters

37:54.606 --> 37:56.973
years ago,
I cast Diane out of my life.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.642
Not only because
of her crimes,

37:58.644 --> 38:01.378
but because I knew that if you
ever discovered the truth,

38:01.380 --> 38:04.047
you'd murder my mother
with your bare hands.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.716
And since she's gone missing,
I can't help but wonder.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.985
You're not
thinking clearly.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.654
Did you kill her?

38:11.957 --> 38:14.557
Did you kill my mother?!

38:14.559 --> 38:16.559
She murdered my children.

38:16.561 --> 38:17.861
My babies.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.532
Where is she?

38:22.534 --> 38:24.401
My mother deserves
a proper burial.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.602
Does she?

38:25.604 --> 38:28.605
Her body's in the sea.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.541
(yelling)

38:31.543 --> 38:33.610
(choking)

38:33.612 --> 38:36.446
Bash, think.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.615
I'm the regent of France!

38:40.485 --> 38:42.952
How will you explain
my death at your hands?

38:42.954 --> 38:44.621
You have no proof.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.425
Is your mother,

38:48.427 --> 38:50.493
a woman who would sacrifice
anyone for her own gain,

38:50.495 --> 38:51.828
worth dying for?

38:51.830 --> 38:52.996
(grunts)

38:52.998 --> 38:54.898
Oh...
(yells)

38:54.900 --> 38:56.933
(gasping)

39:03.508 --> 39:05.942
Since you are
the real king of France,

39:05.944 --> 39:09.012
consider this my resignation
as your deputy.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.480
(panting)

39:14.019 --> 39:17.554
(door opens, closes)

39:17.556 --> 39:20.123
You despise me,
and yet you expect a free ride?

39:20.125 --> 39:21.558
You're about to
set sail on a boat

39:21.560 --> 39:22.759
full of unfamiliar
mercenaries.

39:22.761 --> 39:23.993
I can provide protection

39:23.995 --> 39:26.429
and tactical knowledge
for the journey.

39:26.431 --> 39:28.498
And when we make
land in Scotland,

39:28.500 --> 39:29.766
we both go our
separate ways.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.868
You're going to England
to free Lola.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.537
If you think I'm leaving the
safety of my wife in your hands,

39:34.539 --> 39:36.606
forgive me for saying it,
but you're out of your mind.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.608
BASH:
Am I interrupting something?

39:38.610 --> 39:40.377
Bash, what are you
doing here?

39:40.379 --> 39:41.845
Do you have room
for one more?

39:41.847 --> 39:44.147
You must, if this one
is slithering aboard.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.682
I'll be on the boat.

39:45.684 --> 39:46.883
Sebastian, I told you...

39:46.885 --> 39:49.119
There is nothing
for me here anymore.

39:49.121 --> 39:50.487
I can't stay.

39:50.489 --> 39:51.621
What's happened?

39:51.623 --> 39:54.724
I need to leave France,

39:54.726 --> 39:57.494
and you need someone
at your side you can trust.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.430
I could use a friend
on the journey ahead.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.932
I'm glad to see you.
Thank you.

40:09.741 --> 40:14.544
France, I think I shall
never see you again.

40:20.485 --> 40:22.485
What is it?

40:22.487 --> 40:25.054
It's a parting gift
from Bash.

40:26.925 --> 40:30.760
You had my sister beaten so you
could reclaim the regency.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.863
You deceived
and betrayed me.

40:33.865 --> 40:36.499
Claude, please.
Go to hell!

40:36.501 --> 40:39.102
You may be regent,

40:39.103 --> 40:41.704
but I am king, and you will pay
for what you've done.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.448
SAILOR:
Tie it down! Tie it down!

40:51.450 --> 40:54.150
Port astern! Secure the halyard!

40:54.152 --> 40:55.151
(thunder crashing)

40:55.153 --> 40:56.753
(grunting)

40:59.825 --> 41:01.691
All right, the storm
is getting worse.

41:01.693 --> 41:03.493
You should go
to your cabin.
Your Majesty!

41:03.495 --> 41:04.761
Now!

41:05.831 --> 41:07.497
