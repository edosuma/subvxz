00:03.069 --> 00:05.138
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE GOING TO SCHOOL?

00:05.205 --> 00:07.006
AND SHOULDN'T YOU
BE WEARING PANTS?

00:07.073 --> 00:08.341
THEY'RE STILL WET.

00:08.408 --> 00:10.243
SO? USE MAGIC
TO MAKE NEW ONES.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.679
MAGIC JEANS COME OUT
ALL STIFF AND NEW.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.614
THESE ARE BROKEN IN.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.083
MAYBE I JUST NEED
TO CLEAN THE LINT TRAP.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.084
DON'T.

00:18.151 --> 00:19.319
THAT'S A MAGIC DRYER.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.554
IT FLUFFS, IT FOLDS
AND IT NEVER LOSES A SOCK.

00:21.621 --> 00:22.689
BUT IT'S ON THE FRITZ.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.724
WE'RE STILL WAITING
FOR THE REPAIRMAN.

00:24.791 --> 00:27.093
WHEN WAS HE SUPPOSED
TO SHOW UP?

00:27.160 --> 00:29.229
SOMETIME BETWEEN
1968 AND 1998.

00:29.295 --> 00:30.563
FORGET IT.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.732
I'LL JUST WEAR CLAMMY JEANS.

00:32.799 --> 00:35.034
HEY, THEY'RE STUCK.

00:35.101 --> 00:36.369
(<i> screams</i> )

00:36.436 --> 00:38.104
CALL THE REPAIRMAN NOW!

00:41.641 --> 00:45.645
[Captioning sponsored by
VIACOM PRODUCTIONS]

00:57.724 --> 00:59.759
GOOD LOOK.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.828
WISH I HAD MY LICENSE.

01:05.765 --> 01:07.467
I'M MAKING
SUGAR COOKIES.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.068
WITH BITS OF LIVER?

01:09.135 --> 01:10.470
NO, SPRINKLES.

01:10.537 --> 01:11.604
YECH!

01:11.671 --> 01:13.072
HEY, I'M BACK.

01:13.139 --> 01:14.574
DID YOU HAVE FUN
AT JENNY'S?

01:14.641 --> 01:16.075
IT WAS AMAZING.

01:16.142 --> 01:18.278
LAST NIGHT, WE HAD
CASSEROLE, PLAYED MONOPOLY

01:18.344 --> 01:20.146
AND THEN, WE WATCHED TV.

01:20.213 --> 01:21.714
HOW WILL YOU EVER
WIND DOWN?

01:21.781 --> 01:23.817
IT WAS FUN
TO BE IN A NORMAL HOUSE

01:23.883 --> 01:26.219
WITH A NORMAL FAMILY
DOING NORMAL THINGS.

01:26.286 --> 01:28.588
YOU'VE NEVER INVITED
JENNY FOR A SLEEP OVER

01:28.655 --> 01:30.323
BECAUSE YOU THINK
WE'RE WEIRD?

01:30.390 --> 01:31.758
THAT'S A COMPLICATED QUESTION

01:31.825 --> 01:33.460
BUT THE SHORT ANSWER
WOULD BE YES.

01:33.526 --> 01:35.562
WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

01:35.628 --> 01:38.164
WE CAN BE AS NORMAL
AS ANYONE.

01:38.231 --> 01:40.133
WATCH--
I'M MIXING BY HAND

01:40.200 --> 01:42.735
JUST LIKE
A PIONEER WOMAN.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.839
NOW I WANT YOU
TO INVITE JENNY OVER.

01:45.905 --> 01:47.173
HOW ABOUT NEXT FRIDAY?

01:47.240 --> 01:48.508
I HAVE MY BOOK CLUB...

01:48.575 --> 01:51.478
JENNY IS NOT MEETING
YOUR BRAINY FRIENDS.

01:51.544 --> 01:53.446
COULD I FINISH
MY SENTENCE?

01:53.513 --> 01:55.882
I HAVE MY BOOK CLUB,
BUT I'LL CANCEL IT.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.885
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS INVITE JENNY OVER.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.220
WHAT IF I FORGET?

02:00.286 --> 02:01.321
I'LL REMIND YOU.

02:01.387 --> 02:06.125
AND I PROMISE, WE WILL BE
AS NORMAL AS NORMAL CAN BE.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.496
TALLY HO.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.731
WHO WANTS TO PLAY
MINIATURE POLO?

02:12.732 --> 02:14.367
I'LL HAVE A TALK
WITH HER.

02:18.371 --> 02:20.540
SO THEN, JENNY'S DAD
LANDED ON PARK PLACE

02:20.607 --> 02:24.377
AND TO PAY THE RENT,
HE HAD TO BORROW THE MONEY
FROM HER LITTLE BROTHER.

02:24.444 --> 02:25.745
IT WAS SUPER FUNNY.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.780
MY FAMILY CAN'T PLAY
BOARD GAMES.

02:27.847 --> 02:30.216
NOT SINCE
THE PICTIONARY INCIDENT.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.219
I STILL CAN'T
TALK ABOUT IT.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.188
YOU SHOULD HANG OUT
AT JENNY'S HOUSE.

02:35.255 --> 02:36.389
HER FAMILY'S REALLY NICE.

02:36.456 --> 02:37.490
AND A LITTLE BORING.

02:37.557 --> 02:38.491
BUT THEY LOVE YOU.

02:38.558 --> 02:39.893
YOU SHOULD COME OVER
SATURDAY.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.227
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

02:41.294 --> 02:42.262
OW!

02:42.328 --> 02:43.596
WHY DID YOU KICK ME?

02:43.663 --> 02:44.664
I DIDN'T KICK YOU.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.199
THAT'S WEIRD.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.667
WHAT TIME
SHOULD I COME OVER?

02:47.734 --> 02:49.702
OW!

02:49.769 --> 02:50.904
WHAT IS IT?

02:50.970 --> 02:52.572
OH, JUST A REMINDER.

02:52.639 --> 02:56.342
UM, I THINK IT'S MY TURN
TO HAVE YOU OVER MY HOUSE.

02:56.409 --> 02:57.310
THAT SOUNDS FUN.

02:57.377 --> 02:58.745
DON'T ANSWER RIGHT AWAY.

02:58.811 --> 03:01.347
YOU SHOULD KNOW I HAVE
THESE TWO WEIRD AUNTS.

03:01.414 --> 03:02.682
BUT I LIKE WEIRD.

03:02.749 --> 03:03.850
I LOVE WEIRD.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.618
I BASK IN THE GLOW
OF WEIRD...

03:05.685 --> 03:07.854
I THINK JENNY
WILL FIT RIGHT IN.

03:07.921 --> 03:08.955
OW!

03:09.022 --> 03:11.257
THAT WAS ME.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.328
OKAY, LOOKING NORMAL.

03:15.395 --> 03:18.264
OH, GOT TO GET RID
OF MY MAGIC BOOK.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.369
COME ON.

03:23.436 --> 03:24.904
STAY.

03:24.971 --> 03:26.439
GOOD BOOK.

03:26.506 --> 03:30.510
OKAY, NOW, SALEM,
WE NEED TO WORK ON YOUR MEOW.

03:30.577 --> 03:31.511
SAY WHAT?

03:31.578 --> 03:33.246
IT HAS TO SOUND
REAL FOR JENNY.

03:33.313 --> 03:34.247
LET'S HEAR IT.

03:34.314 --> 03:35.415
OKAY...(<i> clears throat</i> )

03:35.481 --> 03:36.849
(<i> with human voice</i> ):
MEOW.

03:36.916 --> 03:38.585
CAN'T YOU DO IT MORE CATTY?

03:38.651 --> 03:40.453
(<i> catlike</i> ):
MEOW.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.387
YEAH.

03:41.454 --> 03:42.789
THAT IS SO CLICHE.

03:42.855 --> 03:43.690
HUMOR ME.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.291
THERE'S STILL SOMETHING

03:45.358 --> 03:46.793
WEIRD ABOUT THIS ROOM.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.294
I KNOW.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.563
THERE...

03:50.630 --> 03:51.598
IT WAS TOO NEAT.

03:51.664 --> 03:52.732
NOW IT'S PERFECT.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.400
SALEM, THIS COULD BE FUN.

03:54.467 --> 03:55.835
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU,
SABRINA.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.370
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO HAVE FRIENDS OVER.

03:57.437 --> 03:58.705
OR IN OTHER WORDS?

03:58.771 --> 04:00.306
MEOW.

04:03.509 --> 04:06.846
LOOK, I'M PLUMPING PILLOWS
ALL BY MYSELF.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.581
I AM SO IMPRESSED.

04:08.648 --> 04:09.916
WHAT SMELLS WEIRD?

04:09.983 --> 04:11.250
HILDA'S COOKING.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.585
OH, NO.

04:14.821 --> 04:15.888
HI, KITTEN.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.957
I JUST MADE
TUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.492
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:19.559 --> 04:20.893
(<i> coughing</i> )

04:20.960 --> 04:22.562
I THINK YOU'RE BOTH OVERDONE.

04:22.629 --> 04:24.998
HERE. I MADE A LIST
OF POSSIBLE TOPICS

04:25.064 --> 04:27.634
FOR TONIGHT'S
DINNER CONVERSATION.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.602
IF ONE DOESN'T WORK,
MOVE ON.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.471
BUT DON'T STRAY FROM THE LIST.

04:31.537 --> 04:33.940
HEY, I THINK I KNOW
WHAT TO TALK ABOUT.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.441
TOWELS?

04:35.508 --> 04:36.342
(<i> doorbell ringing</i> )

04:36.409 --> 04:37.877
OKAY, SHE'S HERE.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.045
TENSE UP.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.947
RELAX. THAT'S
THE UPSTAIRS DOORBELL.

04:41.014 --> 04:41.948
UPSTAIRS DOORBELL?

04:42.015 --> 04:43.316
FOR THE LINEN CLOSET.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.585
WE MUST HAVE GUESTS
FROM THE OTHER REALM.

04:45.652 --> 04:46.919
CAN'T WE PRETEND
WE'RE NOT HERE?

04:46.986 --> 04:48.788
WHAT IF IT'S
SOMEONE IMPORTANT?

04:48.855 --> 04:51.658
FINE. BUT I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY OUR LINEN CLOSET

04:51.724 --> 04:52.759
DOESN'T HAVE
A PEEPHOLE.

04:52.825 --> 04:53.860

04:53.926 --> 04:55.995
I'M HERE ABOUT YOUR DRYER.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.897
I'LL TAKE YOU
TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.032
OH, THANKS.

04:59.098 --> 05:00.700
ZELDA, LOOK.

05:00.767 --> 05:01.734
YOU HAVE A...

05:01.801 --> 05:02.869
SHH. DON'T BE RUDE.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.504
NOTHING.

05:06.606 --> 05:07.874
HE CAN'T STAY.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.475
HE HAS A TAIL.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.544
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HAVING A TAIL?

05:11.611 --> 05:13.613
SABRINA, YOU AREN'T
A RUMPIST, ARE YOU?

05:13.680 --> 05:15.581
A RUMPIST?
WHAT'S A RUMPIST?

05:15.648 --> 05:17.950
SOMEONE WHO JUDGES OTHERS
BY THEIR REAR ENDS.

05:18.017 --> 05:19.552
NO.

05:19.619 --> 05:20.687
OKAY, NOT USUALLY.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.655
IT'S NOT ME I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

05:22.722 --> 05:23.656
IT'S JENNY.

05:23.723 --> 05:24.857
IS SHE A RUMPIST?

05:24.924 --> 05:26.893
NO. BUT IF SHE SEES A REPAIRMAN
WITH A TAIL

05:26.959 --> 05:28.428
SHE MIGHT
GET SUSPICIOUS.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.462
OH, RELAX.

05:29.529 --> 05:30.630
WE'LL KEEP HIM
OUT OF SIGHT.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.833
HE'LL FIX THE DRYER
AND BE GONE BEFORE
YOU KNOW IT.

05:33.900 --> 05:34.767
(<i> doorbell ringing</i> )

05:34.834 --> 05:36.102
OH, THAT'S PROBABLY HER.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.537
DO I HAVE
TO ANSWER IT?

05:37.603 --> 05:38.604
YES.

05:39.639 --> 05:41.040
HEY, YOU'RE HERE.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.009
YOU TOO.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.510
IT'S A GREAT HOUSE.

05:44.577 --> 05:47.647
COME ON IN. I'LL, UH,
GIVE YOU THE GRAND TOUR.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.716
OKAY, HERE'S A BUNCH
OF STUFF WE OWN.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.050
ALL VERY NORMAL.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.786
OKAY, LET'S GO SEE
IF DINNER'S READY.

05:53.853 --> 05:57.023
WELL, IT'S KIND OF MISLEADING
TO CALL THAT THE GRAND TOUR.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.792
...FROM THE HAND TOWEL
TO THE GUEST TOWEL

05:59.859 --> 06:02.061

TO THE BATH SHEET

OUR NATION GREAT.

TOWELS.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.967
(<i> yawns</i> )

06:08.034 --> 06:10.737
OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.739
OH, THE COLLAPSE OF THE ECONOMY

06:12.805 --> 06:13.940
ON THE ISLE OF MAN.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.145
HILDA, WOULD YOU HELP ME
CLEAR THE TABLE?

06:19.212 --> 06:19.979
I'LL HELP.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.414
NO! NO!

06:21.481 --> 06:22.448
YOU'RE OUR GUEST.

06:24.684 --> 06:25.952
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:26.018 --> 06:29.489
YOU'VE GOT A LINT GREMLIN
GROWING IN YOUR DRYER.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.157
DID YOU GET RID
OF HIM?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.959
NO. I GOT
A PIECE OF HIM.

06:33.025 --> 06:34.627
WELL, FIND THE REST.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.629
AND BE
QUICK ABOUT IT.

06:36.696 --> 06:38.397
OUR NIECE HAS
A MORTAL OVER.

06:38.464 --> 06:39.732
OH, A MORTAL.

06:39.799 --> 06:42.101
I'D TUCK IN MY TAIL,
BUT IT TICKLES.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.039
SO IS EVERYTHING
OKAY?

06:47.106 --> 06:48.708
AS OKAY AS APPLE PIE.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.042
WOW!
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

06:50.109 --> 06:51.177
COULDN'T BE BETTER.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.979
UNLESS
THERE'S ICE CREAM.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.448
THERE IS... IN THE FREEZER.

06:55.515 --> 06:56.783
I'LL GET IT.

06:56.849 --> 06:58.718
MY PARENTS FORCED
MANNERS ON ME.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.052
I MIGHT AS WELL
USE THEM.

07:00.119 --> 07:02.054
I THINK EVERYTHING'S GOING
REALLY WELL.

07:02.121 --> 07:05.091
EXCEPT FOR THE LINT GREMLIN
THAT'S ESCAPED FROM THE DRYER.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.759
HE GOT OUT?

07:06.826 --> 07:08.094
(<i> Jenny screaming</i> )

07:08.161 --> 07:10.196
JENNY!

07:10.263 --> 07:10.997
ARE YOU OKAY?

07:11.063 --> 07:13.132
NO. I JUST SAW
THE HUGEST SPIDER.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.133
SPIDER?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.434
THAT'S GREAT.

07:16.369 --> 07:19.205
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE SPIDERS
EAT OTHER BUGS.

07:19.272 --> 07:23.609
HEY, HOW ABOUT WE, UH...
LOOK AT THAT ICE CREAM.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.912
Jenny:
WOW, YOU'VE GOT LOTS
OF FLAVORS.

07:25.978 --> 07:27.113
EW, IT'S ALL
NON-FAT.

LET'S GO UP TO MY ROOM.

07:28.714 --> 07:29.949
HEY, I'LL RACE YOU.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.083

07:41.060 --> 07:42.228
Zelda:
IRWIN? VILIA?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.130
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:44.197 --> 07:46.132
OUR BOOK CLUB
WAS CANCELED TONIGHT.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.133
DIDN'T YOU GET
MY E-MAIL?

07:47.200 --> 07:49.869
Vilia:
NO. WE HAD TO DROP
OUR AOL ACCOUNT

07:49.936 --> 07:53.105
BECAUSE A CERTAIN
PERSON COULDN'T STAY
OUT OF THE CHAT ROOMS.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.174
Irwin:
WHERE ELSE
CAN I BE JUDGED

07:55.241 --> 07:57.143
BY HOW I THINK,
NOT BY HOW I LOOK?

07:57.210 --> 08:00.580
I'M SURE IT'S DIFFICULT
BEING A BRAIN IN A JAR,
BUT YOU CAN'T COME IN.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.048
THE TAXI WON'T BE
BACK FOR HOURS.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.150
SORRY.
THINK WARM THOUGHTS.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.819
HILDA, WE CAN'T
JUST LEAVE THEM OUTSIDE.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.588
THEY'LL GET BRAIN FREEZE.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.857
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING FOR NORMAL.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.525
THE GIRLS ARE UPSTAIRS.

08:12.592 --> 08:15.127
WE'LL TAKE THE BRAINS
IN THE DINING ROOM

08:15.194 --> 08:16.929
AND SABRINA WILL NEVER KNOW.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.631
COME ON IN.

08:18.698 --> 08:19.832
YAY.
YAY.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.535
OKAY, BUT I'D JUST LIKE
TO POINT OUT

08:22.602 --> 08:24.237
THAT I AM AGAINST THIS.

08:24.303 --> 08:25.838
OH, PARDON MY FINGER.

08:25.905 --> 08:29.041
ONE 1,000, TWO, 1,000...

08:29.108 --> 08:30.176
(<i> thunder crashing</i> )

08:30.243 --> 08:32.178
THAT'S LESS
THAN TWO MILES AWAY.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.014
YEAH, WE GET A SURPRISING AMOUNT
OF LIGHTNING AROUND HERE.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.582
THIS IS SUCH
A GREAT PLACE.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.085
I MEAN, HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAVE THEIR OWN TURRET?

08:39.151 --> 08:40.853
ME AND RAPUNZEL?

08:40.920 --> 08:44.056
THERE'S A TOTALLY GOTHIC
FEEL TO THIS PLACE

08:44.123 --> 08:45.591
LIKE ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.

08:45.658 --> 08:48.094
COULD... BUT DOESN'T.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.896
TOO BAD.
THAT'S MY DREAM.

08:49.962 --> 08:50.997
I GOT AN IDEA.

08:51.063 --> 08:52.732
WANT TO TELL EACH OTHER SECRETS?

08:52.798 --> 08:54.700
SECRETS?

08:54.767 --> 08:56.102
I'LL GO FIRST.

08:56.168 --> 08:57.670
OKAY, EVER SINCE I READ

08:57.737 --> 08:59.872
<i>THE LION, THE WITCH</i>
<i>AND THE WARDROBE</i>

08:59.939 --> 09:01.173
I'VE BELIEVED IN OTHER REALMS

09:01.240 --> 09:04.810
LIKE THE WAY EDMUND PUSHES PAST
THE COATS AND FALLS INTO NARNIA.

09:04.877 --> 09:08.214
I THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN
IF WE COULD JUST FIND THE DOOR.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.682
WOULDN'T THAT
BE AMAZING?

09:09.749 --> 09:10.983
YEAH.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.854
OKAY, NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
TO TELL ME YOUR SECRET.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.290
WELL, I DON'T REALLY
HAVE ANY SECRETS.

09:17.356 --> 09:20.092
I MEAN, YOU KNOW ME,
I'M AN OPEN BOOK.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.595
OH, COME ON,
EVERYONE HAS SECRETS.

09:22.662 --> 09:25.097
ACTUALLY, UM...
I DO HAVE A SECRET.

09:25.164 --> 09:27.600
I'D REALLY LIKE
TO TELL YOU, BUT...

09:27.667 --> 09:29.235
IT'S KIND OF HARD.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.771
SABRINA, YOU CAN
TELL ME ANYTHING.

09:31.837 --> 09:34.140
I PROMISE I WON'T THINK
IT'S STRANGE.

09:34.206 --> 09:37.810
OKAY, WELL, THE TRUTH IS,
JENNY, I'M A...

09:39.712 --> 09:41.614
REALLY MESSY PERSON.

09:41.681 --> 09:42.748
WHAT?

09:42.815 --> 09:44.216
TOTAL SLOB.

09:44.283 --> 09:46.185
YOU'RE MESSY?
THAT'S YOUR BIG SECRET?

09:46.252 --> 09:47.253
YEAH. SHH.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.254
(<i> bang</i> )

09:48.321 --> 09:49.789
WHAT WAS THAT?

09:49.855 --> 09:51.123
I'LL GO CHECK.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.159
YOU STAY HERE AND...
YOU STAY HERE.

09:53.225 --> 09:57.163
SALEM, GUARD MY DOOR
SO JENNY DOESN'T
GO ANYWHERE, OKAY?

09:57.229 --> 09:58.965
HEY, DOGS GUARD.

09:59.031 --> 10:00.199

10:00.266 --> 10:01.701
AND JUDGE.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.069
OW!

10:03.135 --> 10:05.171
VILIA, THAT WAS TOTALLY
UNCALLED FOR.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.272
OH, MY LEFT LOBE.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.207
WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

10:08.274 --> 10:12.078
WE WERE DISCUSSING
<i>THE SHIPPING NEWS</i>
AND VILIA GOT UPSET.

10:12.144 --> 10:15.047
SHE TELEKINETICALLY
PUSHED ME OFF THE TABLE.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.249
THAT BOOK DID NOT DESERVE
A PULITZER PRIZE.

10:17.316 --> 10:19.151
IF WENDY WASSERSTEIN
CAN WIN ONE...

10:19.218 --> 10:20.686
EXCUSE ME,
I THOUGHT

10:20.753 --> 10:22.221
YOU CANCELED
YOUR BOOK CLUB.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.824
HEY! COME BACK HERE WITH THAT.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.125
Hilda:
HE'S GOT MY PIE!

10:26.192 --> 10:28.260
YOU LITTLE LINT BALL,
GIVE ME MY PIE.

10:28.327 --> 10:29.829
THIS IS INSANE.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.297
I KNEW THIS WOULDN'T WORK.

10:31.364 --> 10:35.668
HERE. I'VE GOT TO GO
TELL JENNY THAT I FEEL SICK
AND SHE'S GOT TO GO HOME.

10:35.735 --> 10:39.171
WE'D BETTER GET YOU BACK
INTO SOME VITAL FLUIDS.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.841
Irwin:
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T PUT ME IN WITH HER.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.175
PLEASE.

10:43.242 --> 10:44.110
SABRINA?

10:44.176 --> 10:47.046
KITTY, DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE LINEN CLOSET IS?

10:47.113 --> 10:48.114
MEOW?

10:48.180 --> 10:50.883
I KNOW IT'S SNOOPING,
BUT THAT TALK ABOUT TOWELS

10:50.950 --> 10:52.418
MADE ME WANT
TO CHECK THEIRS OUT.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.319
MEOW!

10:53.386 --> 10:54.353
I FOUND IT.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.888
MEOW! MEOW!

10:55.955 --> 10:57.223
WHAT'S UP,
SALEM?

10:57.289 --> 10:59.258
JENNY JUST GOT SENT
TO THE OTHER REALM.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.826
YOU'RE KIDDING?

11:00.893 --> 11:02.161
NO. AND I'M GLAD.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.163
NOW EVERYTHING
CAN GO BACK TO NORMAL.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.098
JENNY?

11:06.165 --> 11:08.100
JENNY?!

11:11.971 --> 11:13.072
JENNY, WHERE ARE YOU?

11:13.139 --> 11:14.407
SABRINA, WHAT'S
THE SHOUTING?

11:14.473 --> 11:15.775
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

11:15.841 --> 11:17.977
I THINK JENNY GOT SENT
TO THE OTHER REALM.

11:18.044 --> 11:19.678
OH, NOW, I'M
SURE SHE DIDN'T.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.781
BUT SALEM SAW HER
GO IN THE CLOSET.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.749
OH. THEN I GUESS SHE DID.

11:28.921 --> 11:30.322
HELLO?

11:30.389 --> 11:32.224
IS ANYONE HERE?

WOW.

AM I IN NARNIA?

11:44.003 --> 11:46.238
"SKIPPY, THE OVERLORD'S
UNDERLING."

11:46.305 --> 11:47.773
COOL.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.241
CAN YOU TALK?

11:49.308 --> 11:51.077
(<i> clears throat</i> )

11:51.143 --> 11:52.311
(<i> coughs</i> )

11:52.378 --> 11:55.848
OH, YOU HAVE A FROG
IN YOUR THROAT.

WHERE AM I?

11:57.416 --> 12:00.186

12:00.252 --> 12:02.254
LIMBO? I'M IN LIMBO?

12:02.321 --> 12:03.389
THEN I WAS RIGHT.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.357
THERE IS ANOTHER REALM

12:05.424 --> 12:07.326
AND IT'S
IN SABRINA'S LINEN CLOSET.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.329
WELL, I WONDER IF SABRINA
KNOWS ABOUT THIS.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.399
MAN, SHE WAS HOLDING OUT ON ME.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.135
WELL, IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE
I COULD SPEAK TO?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.271
SOMEBODY WHO COULD TALK.

12:20.306 --> 12:21.774
NO OFFENSE.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.742
I'M JUST NOT VERY GOOD
AT CHARADES.

WOW. AWESOME.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.149
OH, THANKS.

13:03.215 --> 13:06.152
I'VE NEVER SEEN A PLACE
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

13:06.218 --> 13:08.254
IT'S CALLED A GYM.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.788

13:09.855 --> 13:11.557
JENNY. WHO ARE YOU?

13:11.624 --> 13:12.958
WHO AM I?

13:13.025 --> 13:14.426
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

NO. SHOULD I
RECOGNIZE YOU?

13:21.901 --> 13:23.269
NO. I'M A MORTAL.

PICK UP THESE STRAYS?

DON'T LOOK SO SAD.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.555
YOU KNOW YOU
CAN'T HAVE A MORTAL.

13:42.621 --> 13:44.823
YOU DIDN'T FEED
THE LAST ONE.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.894
I DON'T SEE JENNY ANYWHERE.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.196
YOU SAID SHE MIGHT BE IN LIMBO.

13:50.262 --> 13:51.297
WELL, SHE'S NOT.

13:51.363 --> 13:52.398
BUT DON'T WORRY.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.166
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

13:55.234 --> 13:57.036
SOMETIMES, WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH

FOR SOMEONE.

HAVE SEEN HER.

DO TO HER?

14:43.649 --> 14:45.985
I TURNED HER
INTO A GRASSHOPPER.

14:46.051 --> 14:46.685
WHY?

14:46.752 --> 14:48.621
IT WAS EITHER THAT OR A KATYDID.

14:48.687 --> 14:50.055
YOU'LL TURN HER BACK.

14:50.122 --> 14:51.523
YOU WON'T LEAVE HER LIKE THAT.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.141
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO QUIT

16:49.208 --> 16:51.176
BUT MY JOB IS SO STRESSFUL.

16:51.243 --> 16:52.611
STRESS?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.079
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

16:54.146 --> 16:55.647
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE RULES.

16:55.714 --> 16:57.149
I DON'T MAKE THEM UP.

16:57.216 --> 16:58.484
I ONLY READ THEM.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.786
AND, PERSONALLY,
I THINK 714 STINKS.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.155
I MEAN, WHAT IS SO
BAD ABOUT MORTALS?

17:03.222 --> 17:04.156
NOTHING.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.157
ESPECIALLY JENNY.

17:05.224 --> 17:06.625
SHE WAS THE COOLEST.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.494
SO, UH, WHY NOT
FIND A LOOPHOLE?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.295
THERE ARE LOOPHOLES?

17:10.362 --> 17:11.263
DON'T YOU KNOW THE RULE?

17:11.330 --> 17:11.697
WHAT RULE?

17:11.764 --> 17:13.232
I'M OFF DUTY

17:13.298 --> 17:14.566
BUT RULE NUMBER 803:

17:14.633 --> 17:16.802
FOR EVERY RULE,
THERE IS A LOOPHOLE.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.538
IN FACT, THERE ARE
MORE LOOPHOLES THAN RULES.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.173
I CAN SAVE JENNY?

17:21.240 --> 17:23.142
YEAH, BUT NOT
FOR ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.444
I GOT TO FINISH MY BUBBLES.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.547
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.215
LISTEN UP.
"MORTALS WITHOUT

17:30.282 --> 17:31.817
"CONSCIOUS KNOWLEDGE
OF THE REALM

17:31.884 --> 17:33.652
MAY PASS IN AND OUT
OF IT FREELY."

17:33.719 --> 17:34.553
LOOPHOLE.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.722
BUT JENNY
HAS CONSCIOUS
KNOWLEDGE.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.690
SO WE GET<i> RID</i>
OF THE CONSCIOUS PART.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.192
WE KNOCK
HER OUT?

17:40.259 --> 17:41.760
NO. CONVINCE HER IT'S A DREAM.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.295
THEN SHE CAN LEAVE.

17:43.362 --> 17:44.196
NO, SHE CAN'T.

17:44.263 --> 17:45.297
YES, SHE CAN.

17:45.364 --> 17:46.432
I HAVE IT IN WRITING.

17:46.498 --> 17:47.499
OH, TOOTHPICKS.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.500
SORRY.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.835
RULES ARE RULES

17:49.902 --> 17:51.637
BUT LOOPHOLES
ARE LOOPHOLES.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.472
OKAY. GIVE IT A TRY.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.476
SABRINA,
YOU'RE HERE.

17:57.543 --> 17:58.677
NO, I'M NOT

17:58.744 --> 18:00.212
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

18:00.279 --> 18:01.814
YOU'RE HAVING A DREAM.

18:01.880 --> 18:02.915
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT.

18:02.981 --> 18:06.151
IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE JUST MAKING
SWOOSHY ARM MOTIONS.

18:06.218 --> 18:07.386
HELP ME OUT HERE.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.521
BUT YOU ARE
DREAMING, JENNY.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.391
OOH, LOOK AT THE
SIZE OF THIS FRUIT.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.693
AND NOW, YOU HAVE
TO HAVE A TEST.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.694
A TEST?

18:15.761 --> 18:16.762
WELL, WHAT'S IT ON?

18:16.829 --> 18:17.830
I HAVEN'T STUDIED.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.331
INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY.

18:19.398 --> 18:20.432
BETTER GET
TO WORK.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.201
"THE CUTTLEFISH
AND THE NAUTILUS.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.402
COMPARE AND CONTRAST."

18:23.469 --> 18:25.304
BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANY OF THESE.

18:25.370 --> 18:25.938
AHH!

18:26.004 --> 18:27.606
TIME'S UP.
YOU FAILED.

18:27.673 --> 18:28.574
I JUST STARTED.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.808
IT'S BEEN HOURS.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.311
AND NOW LOOK--
YOUR DEAD GRANDFATHER.

18:32.377 --> 18:33.612
COME HERE, QUICK.

18:33.679 --> 18:35.147
GET ON THIS.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.348
RUN TO HIM.

18:37.382 --> 18:40.252
GRANDPA! GRANDPA!

18:40.319 --> 18:43.655
I'M RUNNING AS FAST AS I CAN,
BUT I'M NOT GETTING ANY CLOSER.

18:43.722 --> 18:46.725
THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S A DREAM.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.260
MAYBE IT IS A DREAM.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.496
BUT THERE'S STILL
SOMETHING MISSING.

18:50.562 --> 18:51.563
WHAT?

18:51.630 --> 18:53.465
JACK WAGNER.
HE'S IN ALL MY DREAMS.

18:53.532 --> 18:54.500
THERE HE IS.

18:54.566 --> 18:56.134
JACK!

18:56.201 --> 18:57.302
YOU MADE IT!

18:57.369 --> 18:58.871
WELL, WHERE AM I?

18:58.937 --> 19:00.205
IN MY DREAM.

19:00.272 --> 19:01.707
THIS ALL SEEMS SO REAL.

19:01.773 --> 19:03.175
I'M A VISUAL PERSON.

19:03.242 --> 19:04.910
REMEMBER THE TIME
YOU RESCUED ME

19:04.977 --> 19:06.345
FROM THE EVIL KING HERBERT

19:06.411 --> 19:08.347
AND WE GOT MARRIED
AT STONEHENGE?

19:08.413 --> 19:10.282
NO, NOT REALLY.

19:10.349 --> 19:12.184
BUT HOW COULD YOU FORGET?

19:12.251 --> 19:14.253
YOU PROMISED TO LOVE ME
FOREVER AND EVER.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.654
JENNY, GET A GRIP.

19:15.721 --> 19:16.588
BYE, JACK.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.258
DON'T GO, JACK.
DON'T GO.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.626
YOU COULD RUN AFTER HIM.

19:20.692 --> 19:22.694
WELL, THAT NEVER
GETS ME ANYWHERE.

19:22.761 --> 19:24.496
I DON'T LIKE
THIS DREAM ANYMORE.

19:24.563 --> 19:25.664
I WANT TO WAKE UP.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.900
TO WAKE UP,
YOU HAVE TO GO TO SLEEP.

19:27.966 --> 19:29.768
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.604
THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S A DREAM.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.339
Both:
DREAM.

19:34.406 --> 19:35.574
MAYBE I DO NEED A NAP.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.409
YOU'RE VERY SLEEPY.

19:37.476 --> 19:40.479
VERY SLEEPY.

19:44.249 --> 19:44.850
(<i> softly</i> ):
IT WORKED.

19:44.917 --> 19:45.851
WAKE UP!

19:45.918 --> 19:47.686
SHH! RULE NUMBER 42:

19:47.753 --> 19:49.555
LET SLEEPING MORTALS LIE.

19:49.621 --> 19:50.689
TOO BAD, DRELL.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.491
LOOKS LIKE I WIN THIS ROUND.

19:52.558 --> 19:53.825
HA!

19:53.892 --> 19:57.529
YOU TINY LITTLE WITCHES
ARE SO ANNOYING.

19:59.398 --> 20:00.666
TELL YOU WHAT

20:00.732 --> 20:02.634
NEXT WEEK, YOU CAN GO
TO JENNY'S HOUSE.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.605
YOU KNOW WHAT
I REGRET?

20:06.672 --> 20:09.308
NOT GETTING
JACK WAGNER'S AUTOGRAPH.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.510
OKAY. NOW GENTLY
PUT HER ON THE BED.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.216
YES!

20:18.283 --> 20:19.284
WE DID IT.

20:19.351 --> 20:20.419
THAT WAS CLOSE.

20:20.485 --> 20:22.955
SEE? EVERYTHING
TURNED OUT FINE.

20:23.021 --> 20:26.325
AT LAST,
MARVIN GARDENS IS MINE.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.359
(<i> laughing</i> )

20:27.426 --> 20:28.527
IT'S JUST LUCK.

20:28.594 --> 20:29.995
YOU KNOW,
HAVING A BRAIN

20:30.062 --> 20:31.797
DOESN'T HELP AT
ALL IN THIS GAME.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.966
LINTY, DID YOU
EAT MY PIE?

20:34.866 --> 20:38.270
YEP, IT'S JUST ANOTHER
NORMAL NIGHT AT THE SPELLMANS'.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.341
MORNING.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.342
MORNING.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.676
YOU SLEEP OKAY?

20:44.743 --> 20:46.244
LIKE A ROCK.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.513
EXCEPT I HAD THE
FREAKIEST DREAM LAST NIGHT

20:48.580 --> 20:49.514
AND YOU WERE IN IT.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.382
REALLY?

20:50.449 --> 20:51.984
UH-HUH. I WENT TO
ANOTHER DIMENSION

20:52.050 --> 20:53.752
AND A GIANT
WITCH NAMED DRELL

20:53.819 --> 20:55.320
TURNED ME INTO
A GRASSHOPPER.

20:55.387 --> 20:55.988
SOUNDS SCARY.

20:56.054 --> 20:57.356
YEAH.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.424
BUT, FORTUNATELY,
JACK WAGNER SAVED ME.

20:59.491 --> 21:01.426
JACK WAGNER SAVED YOU?

21:01.493 --> 21:04.029
YOU'RE SURE
I DIDN'T SAVE YOU?

21:04.096 --> 21:05.697
I DON'T THINK SO.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.299
BUT IT WAS FUN.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.001
I WISH BIZARRE
STUFF LIKE THAT

21:09.067 --> 21:11.003
COULD HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

21:11.069 --> 21:12.838
YEAH, BUT...

21:12.904 --> 21:15.007
THEN AGAIN, YOU MIGHT
NOT APPRECIATE IT

21:15.073 --> 21:16.775
AS MUCH AS YOU THINK.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.048
"RULE NUMBER 56:

21:23.115 --> 21:25.050
"ALL WITCHES MUST
EAT THEIR CARROTS.

IS THAT IT?

21:51.376 --> 21:52.644
I DON'T GET THAT ONE.
