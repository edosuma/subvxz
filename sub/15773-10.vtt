00:02.953 --> 00:04.514
- All right, I'll do it.

00:05.024 --> 00:05.814
- Do what?

00:05.894 --> 00:08.143
- I'm hosting a bachelor
auction for charity

00:08.144 --> 00:10.132
and they asked to Bugs to be on it.

00:10.234 --> 00:10.937
- What am I?

00:10.938 --> 00:11.585
Invisible?

00:11.608 --> 00:13.483
I'm the most eligible bachelor here.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.693
What's the charity?

00:14.804 --> 00:16.093
- The literacy.

00:16.094 --> 00:17.742
- That's my favorite charity.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.020
There's too much literacy in the world!

00:20.028 --> 00:21.974
We need to fight against literacy!

00:22.034 --> 00:25.808
- Uh, Daffy,
the fight is for literacy.

00:25.886 --> 00:26.863
- What?!

00:26.864 --> 00:28.304
Who's for literacy?

00:28.374 --> 00:31.269
Our highways
and bywaysare covered in litter.

00:31.276 --> 00:33.744
I for one think
it should be a crime.

00:34.046 --> 00:35.616
- Littering is a crime.

00:35.624 --> 00:37.004
You went to jail for it.

00:37.374 --> 00:40.614
Literacy is the ability
to read and write.

00:40.684 --> 00:43.355
- Oh!
Then count me in.

00:43.363 --> 00:44.488

train rollin', ladies.

02:11.929 --> 02:14.062

02:14.063 --> 02:15.460
and no education.

02:15.468 --> 02:19.114
And a credit score of negative 13.

02:19.184 --> 02:22.514
Let's start the bidding at $50.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.385

02:55.192 --> 02:57.724
- I thought we'd
clean out my attic.

02:58.010 --> 02:59.189
- Clean your attic?

02:59.197 --> 03:00.894
What's romantic about that?

03:00.954 --> 03:02.532
- I'm a 90 year old woman.

03:02.539 --> 03:03.257
[Crash]

03:03.273 --> 03:05.594
- Get your mind out
of the gutter.

03:06.890 --> 03:07.718
[Crash]

03:08.939 --> 03:11.540

03:27.622 --> 03:28.464
I'm home.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.050
- But not for long,

03:30.066 --> 03:32.720
'cause we are going to
Paris, France!

03:32.736 --> 03:33.923
- What?!
- For our date!

03:33.939 --> 03:34.906
 We're going to Paris.

03:34.922 --> 03:37.103
You know, The City of Lovers.

03:37.126 --> 03:38.078
- No, no, no, no, no.

03:38.079 --> 03:39.064
That's not a date.

03:39.134 --> 03:41.834
A date is dinner
at a restaurant.

03:42.161 --> 03:45.101
- So we'll have dinner at
a restaurant in Paris.

03:45.179 --> 03:47.304
- Lola, I'm not
leaving the country.

03:47.507 --> 03:48.710
- Oh, yes, you are.

03:48.711 --> 03:50.194
It clearly states in article five,

03:50.202 --> 03:52.919
section three of the bachelor
auction bylaws, that the bidder,

03:52.935 --> 03:53.569
that's me.

the date while the bidee,

03:56.257 --> 03:57.739
that's you.
Must escort the bidder

03:57.755 --> 03:58.818
Again, that's me.

03:58.833 --> 04:01.208
On said date for up to but
not exceeding 24 hours.

04:01.216 --> 04:02.482
Again, the bidee

04:02.483 --> 04:03.177

04:03.178 --> 04:04.212
and I'm the bidder

04:04.227 --> 04:05.381
and these are the bylaws.

04:05.382 --> 04:06.594
This is a megaphone.

[Ding]

04:11.559 --> 04:13.899
[Indistinct chatter]

04:15.553 --> 04:17.244

04:17.849 --> 04:19.668
I read all my magazines,

04:19.670 --> 04:21.474
I did the crossword.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.258
I ate all my peanuts.

04:24.259 --> 04:25.492
I ate all your peanuts.

04:26.273 --> 04:27.384
I peed four times.

04:27.407 --> 04:29.944
Oh, I feel like I've been
on this plane forever.

04:29.967 --> 04:31.694
- [Ding]
- Flight attendants,

04:31.709 --> 04:33.561
please prepare the cabin for takeoff.

04:33.733 --> 04:35.153
- How long is this flight again?

04:35.324 --> 04:36.395
- 10 hours.

04:36.396 --> 04:37.443
10 hours there,

04:37.444 --> 04:38.423

04:46.980 --> 04:48.371
That your smile.

04:48.769 --> 04:49.841
Oh, when you frown.

Oh, and the back of your head.

04:57.355 --> 04:58.964
Oh, look at your ears.

- What are those?

05:00.495 --> 05:01.995
- Noise canceling headphones.

05:03.308 --> 05:05.724

another pair, do you?

05:27.443 --> 05:29.318
- Great day in the morning!

05:30.099 --> 05:33.333
How much junk can
a person hoard?

05:33.567 --> 05:36.090
- Oh, if it's broken,
throw it away.

05:36.106 --> 05:39.726
Otherwise, just organize
and clean as you go.

05:39.972 --> 05:42.000
I'll go get us some tea.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.730
Here we are.

05:47.036 --> 05:48.317
- Oh, thank goodness,

05:48.318 --> 05:49.536
I'm melting.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.639
Are you kidding me?

05:52.643 --> 05:54.533
It's a thousand degrees up here!

05:54.534 --> 05:56.874
Ever heard of iced tea?

05:56.907 --> 05:58.937
- Ice will chip tea.

06:01.203 --> 06:04.571
Oh, I haven't seen
these in ages.

06:06.438 --> 06:07.726
- Hubba hubba!

06:07.734 --> 06:10.460
How about you set me up on a date
with your granddaughter, huh?

06:10.491 --> 06:12.046
That's me.

06:12.047 --> 06:13.311
During the war,

06:13.358 --> 06:14.644
I was a WAAC.

06:14.786 --> 06:17.126

06:26.680 --> 06:28.413
I was a spy.

06:28.428 --> 06:29.686
[Spits]

06:30.159 --> 06:33.759
It was the final days
of World War II.

06:34.268 --> 06:36.898
[Helicopter flying]

06:37.217 --> 06:39.959
- Germany still had
control of Paris.

06:40.753 --> 06:45.463
I was told to meet my
contact at the louvre

06:45.469 --> 06:47.669
in front of the "Mona Lisa".

06:47.794 --> 06:48.669
- Hold on.

06:48.670 --> 06:49.825
What's a contact,

06:49.848 --> 06:50.872
what's the louvre,

06:50.873 --> 06:52.210
and what's the "Mona Lisa"?

06:52.366 --> 06:53.764
- Just listen.

06:54.258 --> 06:56.588
[Helicopter flying]

07:06.138 --> 07:09.661
- From now on, all exchanges
are to be delivered

07:09.667 --> 07:12.633
by carrier pigeon from
The Eiffel Tower.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.952
- Carrier pigeon?

07:13.975 --> 07:15.248
I hate birds.

07:19.935 --> 07:21.108
- I was never here.

07:52.412 --> 07:53.435
Hurry, you fools!

08:00.739 --> 08:02.184
The Americans will be here soon.

08:03.665 --> 08:05.579
But we will no longer
control Paris,

08:05.899 --> 08:08.521
but we're not leaving
here empty-handed.

08:08.529 --> 08:11.341
We're going to steal
all of their art.

08:11.398 --> 08:13.929

- A spy!

08:27.574 --> 08:28.222
Get her!

08:28.238 --> 08:29.363
- Did they catch you?

08:29.364 --> 08:30.589
Did they kill you?!

08:30.605 --> 08:31.907
They killed you, didn't they?!

08:33.153 --> 08:33.785
What?!

08:33.787 --> 08:35.129
It's a legitimate question.

08:36.928 --> 08:38.888
- Now, where was I?

08:38.912 --> 08:40.020
- A spy!

I love the louvre.

08:59.286 --> 09:01.846
Oh, I am a louvre lover!

09:01.854 --> 09:04.503
You can't help but fall in love
when you're at the louvre.

09:04.518 --> 09:05.933
Surrounded by

09:05.934 --> 09:07.620
so many beautiful things.

09:07.636 --> 09:10.552
Beautiful, expensive things.

09:10.567 --> 09:14.239
The louvre is the most
incredible place in the world.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.596
The louvre is an art museum?

09:15.597 --> 09:16.639
I thought it was a mall.

09:16.998 --> 09:17.777
Oh, well.

09:17.778 --> 09:18.497
[Chuckles]

When in Rome!

09:20.608 --> 09:21.702

09:21.703 --> 09:22.576
Wait a second.

09:22.584 --> 09:23.750
We're not in Rome.

09:23.751 --> 09:24.968
We should go to Rome!

09:24.992 --> 09:28.308
- Or we could just
Rome around here.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.488
- They have great malls in Rome.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.777
The Mall of America's in Rome.

09:32.778 --> 09:35.449
Oh, no, wait, that's in Canada.
[Gasps] We should go to Canada!

09:35.758 --> 09:36.375
[Whoosh]

09:39.188 --> 09:41.344

10:18.568 --> 10:20.224
- You don't look like
a carrier pigeon.

10:20.233 --> 10:21.872
- There's a shortage of pigeons.

10:21.899 --> 10:24.157
They're using any birds they
can get their hands on.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.030
Go.

10:28.378 --> 10:31.478
I said go!
