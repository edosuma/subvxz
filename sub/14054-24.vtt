00:02.440 --> 00:04.317
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- What about that date?

00:04.480 --> 00:06.710
- You're breaking up with me?
- It never could work. 

00:06.880 --> 00:09.792
- Cal, when you wanna date, let me know.
- It was an accident.

00:09.960 --> 00:13.077
You accidentally slept with Marissa's mom
or accidentally told Marissa?

00:13.240 --> 00:14.673
- I just...
- Get out of here, Luke.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.752
- I don't wanna see him again.
- What about your dad? Kaitlin?

00:17.920 --> 00:19.592
What am I supposed to do without you?

00:19.800 --> 00:21.358
You are not leaving this house.

00:21.520 --> 00:25.195
Or what? You're gonna call the police or
Dr. Milano? You know what? Go ahead.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.396
In fact, why don't you call up
Dad and Caleb?

00:27.560 --> 00:29.516
I'd really love to tell them
why I ran away.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.591
You okay?

00:51.360 --> 00:54.796
Yeah, it's just really sad.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.712
It's just the movie, right?
That's the reason for the tears?

01:00.240 --> 01:03.437
Yes. I'm emotionally stable.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.068
Besides, I'm not the only one crying.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.232
I'm sorry, what? I'm allergic, okay?

01:10.400 --> 01:13.153
And there's so much pollen
in here right now. It's ridiculous.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.433
- Tomorrow we're watching football, okay?
- Football season is five months away.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.070
ESPN Classics, okay?
We'll watch old games.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.630
Maybe next time
we should see a comedy.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.678
What? No, no. I can see sad movies.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.876
Yeah. No, I know you can.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.877
I can't, Ryan, I'm sensitive.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.873
- Okay, so, what now?
- Whatever Coop wants to do.

01:34.040 --> 01:37.077
- Yeah, what do you wanna to do?
- I don't know. It's getting late.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.913
- So you wanna go back?
- Why don't we have a slumber party.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.355
- I'll stay over.
- We all will. We'll sleep in shifts.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.080
- That way, one of us'll be up at all times.
- Doing what?

01:45.240 --> 01:47.117
Hey, whatever you need us to do.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.555
- Look, okay? Guys, I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah. We know.

01:49.720 --> 01:50.948
Why wouldn't you be?

01:51.120 --> 01:55.591
I don't know, because the guy I lost
my virginity to had sex with my mom.

01:57.600 --> 02:01.115
- Oh, yeah, I remember that.
- Look, guys, it's really not that big a deal.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.792
- Why don't we go to Jamba Juice?
- That's a great idea. I love juice.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.032
- Remember that thing with vitamin C?
- The boosts. Free boosts.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.198
Sit down.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.839
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Well, it's not like I had any choice.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.549
All your phone calls and e-mails.
I had to block you from my Buddy List...

02:23.720 --> 02:26.188
...you were so incessant.
- Blocked me?

02:27.120 --> 02:30.032
I thought you were off-line.
You want something?

02:30.200 --> 02:32.191
- The Razzmatazz is...
- Luke...

02:32.360 --> 02:36.273
...I told you, I'm not staying.
So tell me, what is it that's so important?

02:36.680 --> 02:38.955
If you drink it too fast,
you can get a brain freeze.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.031
- So sip it slowly.
- That's good advice.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.350
Okay, guys, I can drink a cold beverage.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.909
I'm telling you, I'm really...

02:52.120 --> 02:54.588
...so not okay.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.390
I guess we'll skip the Razzmatazz.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.077
Hey.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.278
Sorry. I'm surprised that hasn't
happened before.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.000
I'm not saying I'm disappointed
it hasn't happened before.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.357
- I'm saying the mathematical probability...
- Crying during chick flicks.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.909
- Walking in on me getting dressed.
- What's your point?

04:00.080 --> 04:01.991
I'm not seeing what you're getting at.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.510
- Do you work out?
- Not really.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.557
Me neither.
I'm gonna go watch some hockey.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.915
- Hockey season's over.
- Damn it.

04:09.080 --> 04:12.356
- Where you going?
- To find Luke. Beat the crap out of him.

04:12.640 --> 04:16.474
- Where'll the can of whup-ass be opened?
- I'll go to his house, check the pier.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.949
Have you considered our back yard?

04:19.120 --> 04:20.951
- What's up, guys?
- Why don't you tell me?

04:21.120 --> 04:23.918
- Calm down. I didn't come to fight.
- You told me it was over.

04:24.080 --> 04:27.834
It is. Believe me.
I just... I had to talk to her.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.231
Next time you wanna talk to somebody,
talk to Seth, me. Anyone but her.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.879
No one will talk to me.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.112
Sleeping with your ex-girlfriend's mom
kind of yields that result.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.669
- I thought you were my friends.
- You got no friends.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.838
I know.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.520
- But I need your help.
- I'm not gonna help you.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.512
- I'm leaving.
- Thanks for stopping by.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.238
No, I mean, I'm leaving town.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.831
Now that the divorce is final,
my dad just wants to get out, so...

04:54.160 --> 04:56.799
- We got family in Portland.
- You're going with him?

04:59.200 --> 05:02.078
Don't tell anybody.
But that's what I was trying to tell Julie.

05:02.240 --> 05:05.915
And that's what I wanna tell Marissa.
But I wanna tell her myself.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.152
- Look, I don't know, Luke.
- Come on. Please, please. Five minutes.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.880
It's not that much to ask,
to say goodbye.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.632
Then I'm gone.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.833
Please.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.191
- You okay?
- Yeah, just checking the paper...

05:19.360 --> 05:23.672
...for any impending natural disasters
before tomorrow's grand opening.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.149
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No, why be nervous?

05:26.320 --> 05:28.629
If our pre-celebration tonight
goes badly...

05:28.800 --> 05:31.519
...there'll be no time
to fix it before tomorrow night.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.114
I like to anticipate the worst at all times.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.555
It's a Cohen family trait.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.393
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.509
- Yes!
- What is that?

05:46.680 --> 05:49.433
- We're business partners.
- We needed our own secret handshake.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.433
- Secret handshake?
- It's a guy thing.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.478
- You couldn't possibly understand.
- Is this okay?

05:55.760 --> 05:58.149
Or is it putting the "ho" in hostess?

05:58.320 --> 06:01.357
Hailey, it looks great.
But it's not my restaurant.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.272
Jimmy?

06:04.720 --> 06:07.314
Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean...

06:07.480 --> 06:10.153
...we should ask Sandy because...
- I don't have shoes.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.473
It'll serve to distract the customers, which
is good, since they won't be drinking.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.234
The Liquor Board is reneging
on our liquor license.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.598
- They can't. They gave us a permit.
- Must be a mix-up. I'll call the inspector.

06:21.920 --> 06:25.117
See, that's why we Cohens
are always right.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.589
Because the worst always happens.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.395
Come on, Hail. I'll go get your shoes.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.511
So you like the dress?

06:34.680 --> 06:36.910
It's definitely a keeper.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.435
So you'd sit in my section?

06:40.640 --> 06:43.632
How do you even make waitress-speak
sound so...?

06:43.800 --> 06:45.358
Dirty?

06:45.920 --> 06:48.957
I was gonna say "untoward," but, yeah.

06:49.520 --> 06:53.593
Hail, it's your feet, not mine.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.358
Can you believe this?

07:01.040 --> 07:03.429
Okay, Coop. So...

07:03.600 --> 07:05.511
...what's it gonna be, a little salt glow?

07:05.680 --> 07:08.956
Little Tahitian body wrap?
Or maybe a lotion boot?

07:09.120 --> 07:11.270
Okay, not really into exfoliating
right now.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.557
Besides, I promised Ryan
I'd meet him for lunch at the pier.

07:14.720 --> 07:18.508
Lunch at the pier. Corn dogs and pizza.
You know, I read an article in <i>Stuff</i>.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.752
It says carbs send endorphins
to your brain and that makes you happy.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.356
Oh, that's probably Ryan.
I gotta go grab it.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.068
Where'd you leave your phone?
Your dad's room?

07:28.320 --> 07:29.514
No, my room.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.557
You have a room?

07:32.080 --> 07:33.672
Wait.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.273
Hello?

07:36.440 --> 07:38.670
Yeah, Coop.
Like what you've done with the place.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.996
Yeah, I guess I didn't really get around
to unpacking.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.113
How can you live like this?
Your T-shirts touch your sweaters.

07:46.280 --> 07:50.512
I figured that if I didn't hang anything up
then it wouldn't be so permanent.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.839
Anyway, I gotta go meet Ryan.
So do you wanna come or...?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.231
You know what? Do you mind
if I hang out here and watch TV?

07:57.400 --> 08:00.870
The step-monster got her wisdom teeth
pulled. She's whacked out on Percocet...

08:01.040 --> 08:06.160
...leaving drool all over the house.
- Okay, sure. Go ahead. I'll see you later.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.397
- I can't believe they're seeing each other.
- They're not.

08:17.560 --> 08:21.678
- That's not what it looked like last night.
- Last night wasn't what it looked like.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.630
I talked to Luke.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.599
What? You guys are still hanging out?

08:27.760 --> 08:31.230
No, he showed up.
He wants to talk to you. Apologize.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.913
No.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.152
There's no way I could forgive him.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.948
- Maybe for Holly. But not for this.
- I know...

08:40.200 --> 08:42.155
...but it would mean a lot to him.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.718
What's important to him
is really not so important to me.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.673
That's a whole part of my life
I'd just rather keep separate...

08:52.840 --> 08:55.400
...from this part of my life.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.311
You know what we haven't done
in a while?

09:33.320 --> 09:36.039
Listen, I'm all for getting it on
in exotic locales.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.909
But I think your best friend's
bedroom's just really disheveled.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.992
Wow. I like what she's done
with the place.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.674
The cardboard boxes, it feels very...

09:45.840 --> 09:47.717
I'm getting like a garage-sale vibe.

09:47.880 --> 09:52.158
Yes, I know. See, they say your
external life influences your internal life.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.390
- Who says that?
- I read it in <i>ELLE Decor</i>.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.710
- Your favorite magazine.
- You read?

09:56.880 --> 10:00.077
No wonder she's so depressed.
We need to surprise her and fix it up.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.232
Do you think giving her a little
feng shui will help her forget...

10:03.400 --> 10:05.960
...her mom slept with her ex-boyfriend?
- It can't hurt.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.793
Right. Well, that's very sweet.

10:09.360 --> 10:14.354
But if you put a mirror on that wall,
it'd open up the energy flow in this room.

10:14.520 --> 10:17.114
- I know where you're going with this.
- The hardware store.

10:17.840 --> 10:21.310
The hardware store? With, like, the bolts
and the grouting and the Skil saws?

10:21.480 --> 10:24.517
You don't like hardware stores
and you cry during chick flicks.

10:24.680 --> 10:28.434
Next thing you're gonna tell me,
you walk in on Ryan changing.

10:28.800 --> 10:32.429
Come on. That's crazy.
Hey, let's go to the hardware store.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.032
Peter Johnson, from the Liquor Board.
Am I right?

10:37.200 --> 10:40.272
You came here about a month ago
and granted us a liquor license.

10:40.440 --> 10:45.195
Craziest thing. I open my mail, and I read
that our liquor license had been reneged.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.554
Yes.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.719
- Yeah, crazy?
- Yes, your license has been reneged.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.873
Without a liquor license,
this place can't turn a profit.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.634
This is Newport Beach.
Everyone's a borderline alcoholic.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.075
I'm sorry, but your temporary license
was issued...

11:01.240 --> 11:04.437
...before your file landed in front of
the newly appointed commissioner.

11:04.600 --> 11:08.434
- So?
- The name Steve Peiser mean anything?

11:08.600 --> 11:10.113
No.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.794
Well, it might to Jimmy Cooper.

11:12.960 --> 11:16.236
Turns out Mr. Cooper was
Commissioner Peiser's financial advisor...

11:16.400 --> 11:18.960
...before he stole a quarter
of a million dollars from him.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.109
You're kidding me.

11:20.400 --> 11:24.598
It was that financial loss that forced my
boss out of retirement and back to work.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.513
He saw Cooper's name on the file
and said "no way."

11:27.760 --> 11:30.593
Want my advice?
Have Mr. Cooper step down.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.956
So, what do you wanna do for lunch?

11:39.120 --> 11:42.192
I can do mac and cheese
or mac and cheese.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.112
Tough choice.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.549
- I forgot how fun this was.
- Pretty fun.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.516
You know, lunch could wait.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.148
We are having a pretty big dinner.

12:03.440 --> 12:07.319
- Not your dad, is it?
- No, he has a key.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.148
- Mr. Nichol.
- Call me Caleb.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.470
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

12:20.880 --> 12:22.711
No. Yeah, come in.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.955
- Ryan.
- Mr. Nichol.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.475
Would you mind if Marissa
and I had a word, privately?

12:29.360 --> 12:32.591
- Sure.
- Actually, Ryan and I don't have secrets.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.592
It's important.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.432
Well, then I definitely want him here.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.111
What follows doesn't leave
this room then, okay?

12:44.280 --> 12:45.872
Sit down.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.708
Marissa, your mother's
a wonderful woman.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.108
She is?

12:53.720 --> 12:56.951
You're important to her. You and I
haven't spent a lot of time together...

12:57.120 --> 13:00.317
...but it was important to me
to come and get your blessing.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.795
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.233
- You wanna marry my mom?
- I love her very much.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.039
- You don't know her.
- You should give Marissa some time.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.714
- This is kind of a big deal.
- Impossible.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.028
I intend to propose to her
tonight at the restaurant...

13:21.200 --> 13:23.919
...with our friends and family
in attendance.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.111
Well, then I guess I can't stop you.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.077
I'll see you both tonight.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.515
Thanks for your time, dear.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.319
And again, this is just between us.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.630
I want it to be a surprise.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.909
If my mom marries him, she's gonna be
the most powerful woman in Newport.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.588
Not if you tell Caleb the truth.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.874
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.235
- Did you talk to her?
- I tried.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.789
- And?
- I don't think it's gonna happen, man.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.794
- What do you mean?
- She's dealing with a lot of stuff now.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.520
- Family stuff.
- She won't even see me for 30 seconds?

14:19.680 --> 14:23.036
Her dad's restaurant's having its
private opening tonight. She's busy.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.952
- I'm leaving town.
- She doesn't know.

14:25.120 --> 14:28.954
- That's because she won't talk to me.
- Why don't you just write her a letter?

14:29.280 --> 14:31.191
Write her a letter?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.679
- I had your back with Oliver.
- You had sex with her mom.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.638
I didn't just have sex with her, okay?!
I'm in love with her!

14:39.800 --> 14:41.791
- I was... I am in love!
- Don't need to hear it.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.633
But Marissa does. I have to talk to her.
I have to explain.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.792
- Luke, I wouldn't.
- I can't go without making it right.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.998
I won't.

14:56.920 --> 15:00.390
Okay, the plan is, we go to dinner
for, like, 10 minutes, right?

15:00.560 --> 15:03.870
Then we sneak out, come back here
and make magic happen.

15:04.040 --> 15:08.670
Excellent. I'm extremely stealth.
1996, All-School Hide-and-Seek champion.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.913
I do believe Joel Gordon
is still looking for me. The fool.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.197
Hey! Last year's yearbook.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.669
- God, I love yearbooks.
- Listen, let's put it away...

15:18.840 --> 15:20.876
...because we've got
a lot of work to do.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.474
- Stop it!
- Let's just put it back.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.876
Hey, it's you.

15:31.480 --> 15:35.758
- We had a sailing team?
- Yeah. It never got off the ground, but...

15:37.320 --> 15:41.199
- You were in the Comic Book Club?
- I was the president and only member.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.868
Let's see.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.877
- We had a Film Preservation Society?
- Yeah, but it was a long time ago.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.634
So you know, we don't have to...

15:50.800 --> 15:52.392
It's not fun.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.754
Was I really mean to you?

15:59.440 --> 16:01.032
No.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.953
That would have required you
to speak to me.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.995
Or anyone to speak to me.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.239
A lot's changed in a year, huh?

16:25.080 --> 16:26.638
Hey.

16:27.200 --> 16:31.193
"Marissa, you're the greatest.
This summer will rock.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.796
- Love you forever, Luke."
- Yeah.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.599
A lot's definitely changed.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.999
Marissa's gonna need
a whole lot of feng shui.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.790
Hey. You look beautiful.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.598
Thank you.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.915
You look sad.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.630
I thought this would be
a moment to celebrate.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.153
So did I.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.470
You know that mix-up
with the liquor license?

17:15.640 --> 17:17.790
- It's not such a mix-up.
- You're kidding.

17:17.960 --> 17:21.156
It turns out the new commissioner
is a former client of Jimmy's...

17:21.319 --> 17:23.470
...with a quarter-million dollar
score to settle.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.790
Without that license,
there's no point opening.

17:25.960 --> 17:29.635
I've been on the phone trying to call in
favors. I got nothing. The guy is serious.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.634
The only way he'll reconsider is if
Jimmy steps down. Leaves the business.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.917
- You're not considering...
- No, of course not.

17:38.120 --> 17:41.556
Well, there is one last option.
You're not gonna like it.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.517
My dad can be very...

17:43.680 --> 17:45.477
He can be very persuasive.

17:45.640 --> 17:49.269
I may have to throw a few more of these
back before you start bringing up Caleb.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.557
Desperate times.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.676
This is that.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.829
Hey, man. What's going on?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.831
- Where you been?
- What?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.911
- What?
- What's going on?

18:27.080 --> 18:29.548
- Nothing. Not one thing, okay?
- All right.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.430
I'm gonna go pee, okay? So if anyone
asks, that's where I am. For a while.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.033
Right.

18:44.680 --> 18:47.831
- He's getting weirder.
- Didn't think that was possible.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.638
Marissa.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.358
Mom.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.600
That's the warmest conversation
I've had with her in weeks.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.990
I'll have a word, see if I can't help.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.151
I have been known
to be quite persuasive.

19:03.320 --> 19:05.311
So I've heard.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.911
What's with Dad these days?
He's all warm and mushy.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.479
Don't know.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.837
Maybe it's the new
blood-thinning medication he's on.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.989
What about you?
How's your romantic life?

19:21.040 --> 19:23.679
Oh, you know me. Not much.

19:24.320 --> 19:25.514
Vince, thank you so much.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.992
How excited is Jimmy?

19:28.320 --> 19:30.959
He's like a totally different person.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.196
It's so great.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.833
Let's hope tomorrow night
goes as well as tonight.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.310
- Pat. Thanks for coming by.
- My pleasure.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.792
Though I gotta say, Nana Cohen's
meat loaf, trouncing Grandma Cooper's.

19:44.960 --> 19:48.316
- She would expect no less.
- How'd it go today with the Liquor Board?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.597
- All sorted out?
- Working on it. Working on it.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.718
Enjoy it, Jimmy. Moments like this
don't happen every day.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.233
I know.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.711
It's fantastic.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.709
- Hey.
- How you doing?

20:27.240 --> 20:30.312
I'm just happy you're here,
so I don't have to do this alone.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.914
You know me.
Can't get enough of this stuff.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.680
Excuse me, everyone.
I have something I'd like to say.

20:40.680 --> 20:43.558
I hope you're all enjoying yourselves
tonight as much as I am.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.508
Though my enjoyment of life over the last
few months goes beyond this restaurant...

20:47.680 --> 20:49.989
...to a very special lady, Julie Cooper.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.032
What's he doing here?

20:57.280 --> 21:00.636
Julie did a fantastic job
on the d Ácor, didn't she?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.233
Hey, come on, let's go.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.628
And...

21:05.800 --> 21:09.270
- It's here on this opening night...
- Nobody'll talk to me or even look at me.

21:09.520 --> 21:13.149
- Had a little bit to drink?
- I'd like to show her how special she is.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.517
I gotta tell Marissa it wasn't just sex.
I love her mom.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.035
Okay, I don't think that's a good idea.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.759
Julie Cooper...

21:28.160 --> 21:29.639
...will you marry me?

21:31.840 --> 21:33.751
Oh, my God!

21:36.160 --> 21:38.799
Yes, of course I will, Cal.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.029
Kiki!

21:54.560 --> 21:57.597
Luke. Hey. Luke. Hey!

21:57.920 --> 21:59.558
- Look, Luke...
- Don't make me!

21:59.720 --> 22:01.950
Just give me your keys.
Let me drive you home.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.719
What home?

22:25.120 --> 22:26.997
I can't believe he just showed up here.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.754
- I need your car. I need to go after him.
- No.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.196
It's like you're saying
he did nothing wrong.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.510
I'm not taking his side.
I'm not taking any side.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.193
You know what? Maybe you should.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.749
He should have time alone
to think about what he did.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.912
- Feel bad about it.
- He does feel bad...

22:42.080 --> 22:44.640
- That's why he's leaving.
- What are you talking about?

22:45.160 --> 22:49.312
His dad's moving to Portland. He's moving
with him. Because of what happened.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.310
Can I have your keys?
He's had a lot to drink.

23:02.320 --> 23:06.199
- That's cool. I didn't want any, anyway.
- My dad is marrying Julie Cooper.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.999
Julie Cooper is my stepmom.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.196
- Maybe we'll get you another bottle.
- Drink up.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.797
This is an unholy alliance, two storm
fronts colliding. It's the apocalypse for us.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.515
- Maybe you wanna lay off the sauce.
- Think of it.

23:18.680 --> 23:21.478
All the time we were growing up
and you'd come over for dinner...

23:21.640 --> 23:26.031
...you'd go sailing with my dad, did you
ever think he would marry your ex-wife?

23:26.200 --> 23:27.758
- Yeah, give me a glass.
- Never.

23:27.920 --> 23:31.799
Jimbo, the way I see it, this might be
the best thing that could happen to you.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.872
There is nothing good about it.
This marriage is an asteroid...

23:35.040 --> 23:37.918
...that hit the Earth. Now we
have to see what species survives.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.710
I did it. Look.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.475
Wow, you hit a nail!
Bob Vila's your bitch, Cohen.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.876
What?! Why?!

23:53.040 --> 23:55.873
- This is not supposed to happen.
- You have to find the stud.

23:58.280 --> 24:01.317
- You mean like you did, Summer?
- Just get me the stud finder.

24:01.480 --> 24:04.631
Oh, Summer,
I think you are the stud finder.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.837
- See this hammer in my hand?
- What does the stud finder look like?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.433
- And the level.
- What is a level?

24:09.600 --> 24:12.353
- Don't you know what a level is?
- What you advance to in a video game.

24:12.520 --> 24:16.479
That's funny. Yeah.
The tool doesn't know about tools.

24:16.640 --> 24:20.553
My people, we don't really build.
We're not what you would call "handy."

24:20.720 --> 24:23.917
We hire people to do it.
Why don't we just get a contractor?

24:24.840 --> 24:27.308
Or I can paint.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.670
And here I thought
you could only paint the ceiling.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.511
Marissa, hey, listen, l...

25:09.680 --> 25:10.874
No, no. It's me, man.

25:12.760 --> 25:15.228
- I'm fine, man.
- You don't sound fine.

25:15.680 --> 25:20.196
Well, you know, I'm just having
a few beers up at the park...

25:20.360 --> 25:22.271
...rocking out to Seger.
You know the drill.

25:22.440 --> 25:23.668
Not really.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.189
Hey, do me a favor, Ryan.

25:26.520 --> 25:27.953
Tell Marissa I get it.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.476
<i>Okay? I don 't deserve her forgiveness.</i>

25:32.640 --> 25:34.039
I'm...

25:34.200 --> 25:36.430
I'm scum. I'm...

25:36.600 --> 25:39.592
All I ever did was let her down.
Tell her that.

25:39.760 --> 25:42.354
No, just tell me where you are, all right?

25:42.520 --> 25:44.670
You can't leave
without saying goodbye, right?

25:44.840 --> 25:46.353
Right.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.518
Goodbye.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.916
Damn it!

26:21.840 --> 26:24.115
<i>I'm not here. Leave a message.</i>

26:24.280 --> 26:25.872
Julie.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.598
I'm...

26:27.760 --> 26:29.398
I'm leaving tomorrow.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.754
I need to see you.

26:35.040 --> 26:38.350
I'm coming... I'm coming to see you.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.194
You owe me a goodbye!

26:48.600 --> 26:51.239
<i>Without a liquor license,</i>
<i>we'll be belly-up in no time.</i>

26:51.400 --> 26:54.437
- Really? Cal, I had no idea.
- There's no point in opening the place.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.068
That's why I was hoping
I could ask you to do me a favor.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.356
- What?
- Wait, did you not hear me?

26:59.520 --> 27:01.351
I just wanted to hear you say it again.

27:01.720 --> 27:05.349
If it was up to me, I'd rather take the hit
than talk with you. But it's Jimmy.

27:05.520 --> 27:09.354
- The Lighthouse is all he's got.
- Lf you drop him, they'd issue the license.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.997
But you're too much of a martyr.
Listen, Sanford...

27:13.160 --> 27:15.515
...never mix business with friendship.
- You're right.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.875
From now on,
I'm doing all my deals with you.

27:18.160 --> 27:21.357
When you came to me about Uncle Shaun,
I said yes. You owe me.

27:21.520 --> 27:23.988
I don't wanna owe you.
I wanna hold it over your head.

27:25.480 --> 27:29.029
Need water. Tried to lie down,
got the spins.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.475
Well, I better get back to my bride-to-be.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.438
Oh, yeah. Definitely might vomit.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.590
Luke, call us when you get this.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.198
Ryan.

28:58.600 --> 29:01.672
When I saw him at the party last night...

29:02.080 --> 29:04.116
...I wished for something like this
to happen.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.998
It's not your fault.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.468
- How is he?
- Well, he's out of surgery.

29:12.680 --> 29:16.309
He's pretty much out of commission
right now, but the worst is behind him.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.516
I should call my parents.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.599
You guys...

29:20.760 --> 29:24.196
...he's gonna be asleep for a while.
You should go home.

29:25.760 --> 29:29.150
- Maybe we should, so we could finish.
- Or we could sleep.

29:29.480 --> 29:32.756
You know, I'm really glad
that Luke's gonna be okay.

29:32.920 --> 29:34.672
We'll come back.

29:38.520 --> 29:42.035
Actually, I'm gonna stay.
You know, just in case.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.392
Okay.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.876
Then I'll stay too.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.673
<i>I heard he'd been drinking...</i>

29:54.320 --> 29:57.392
...which makes one less inspired
to go after our liquor license.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.790
- Can I get you something to eat?
- No, no, I'm good.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.794
Don't worry about going to city hall. I'll
deal with them. You hold down the fort.

30:03.960 --> 30:06.952
That's not necessary.
You hang at the Lighthouse. Man the ship.

30:07.120 --> 30:10.556
Are we gonna refer to the restaurant
as a ship or a fort?

30:10.720 --> 30:12.517
Well, right now it's a sinking ship.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.753
Okay, not the most inspiring metaphor
on our opening night.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.714
Why don't you sit down?

30:18.880 --> 30:22.395
I can't. I gotta go see what the holdup is
with the liquor license.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.314
You're the holdup, Jimmy.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.838
Does the name Steve Peiser
mean anything to you?

30:29.120 --> 30:33.750
When he went back to work, after his
financial advisor lost his life savings...

30:34.560 --> 30:37.836
...he got a job
as commissioner of the Liquor Board.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.834
This restaurant was supposed to be...

30:44.000 --> 30:45.911
...a chance for me...

30:47.680 --> 30:50.035
...to escape from my past.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.191
I guess there is no escaping, huh?

30:52.360 --> 30:56.751
Well, we do have one possible
Houdini-esque escape left.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.958
Caleb.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.519
I asked him for help.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.630
- You hate asking him for help.
- This was no exception. I had no choice.

31:05.800 --> 31:08.712
You did. You could've told me
the truth and asked me to bow out.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.634
Like I said, I had no choice.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.314
<i>Satellite Pharmacy to room 607.</i>

31:16.480 --> 31:19.677
<i>Satellite Pharmacy, room 607.</i>

31:30.280 --> 31:33.590
Hey, guys. He's up.

31:34.080 --> 31:38.551
You should go home.
And thanks for waiting, all right?

31:40.640 --> 31:42.392
Wait.

31:44.760 --> 31:47.672
Will you tell him that I'm here...

31:48.200 --> 31:49.713
...and I'd like to see him?

31:54.320 --> 31:56.356
I'll start auditioning bands right away.

31:56.520 --> 31:59.432
I need to start soliciting
recommendations for the videographer...

31:59.600 --> 32:02.990
...and the photographer, the engravers.
You know, I should ask Diane Kahn.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.879
She's been married, like,
at least a half a dozen times.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.917
Why aren't you more excited?

32:08.640 --> 32:10.835
Oh, Julie, it was a rough night.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.115
Hey, where are you going?
Why aren't you asleep?

32:16.280 --> 32:17.998
Because Summer's a slave driver.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.116
Is Ryan back from the hospital yet?

32:21.280 --> 32:23.840
- Hospital?
- Oh, didn't you hear?

32:24.000 --> 32:27.276
Luke wrapped his truck
around a telephone pole last night.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.354
- He did?
- Just a few blocks from here.

32:30.520 --> 32:33.956
He was drinking. So unlike him.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.830
Well, I guess he just...

32:40.000 --> 32:42.912
...never really recovered
from everything with his father.

32:44.680 --> 32:47.717
You know, the humiliation,
his family being torn apart.

32:49.040 --> 32:51.031
Yeah, that must be it.

32:53.520 --> 32:57.559
Pour me a bloody mary, will you, James?
Since it'll be the last drink we serve.

32:57.720 --> 33:01.110
- What? That's it?
- Hook, line and sinker.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.430
No license. No opening. No restaurant.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.750
- No comeback.
- That's the best you could do?

33:05.920 --> 33:10.948
- As big a badass as you are?
- Didn't have an effect on this Peiser fella.

33:11.360 --> 33:14.397
You know how to piss people off.
You could teach me a thing or two.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.438
- You seem awfully glib.
- Everything happens for a reason.

33:17.800 --> 33:20.633
Could you at least feign
a little sensitivity at our misfortune?

33:20.800 --> 33:24.554
You know what they say: One man's
misfortune is another man's fortune.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.595
- Who says that?
- I do.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.708
- I've never seen him smile.
- I didn't know he had teeth.

33:30.880 --> 33:33.997
Make yourselves a couple of drinks,
fellas. We should talk.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.388
Cheers.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.916
Are you okay?

33:57.600 --> 33:59.477
I'm so sorry.

33:59.640 --> 34:02.029
I didn't mean for this to happen.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.271
Any of it.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.152
I just...

34:08.840 --> 34:12.514
I didn't have anyone.
I had no one. Not my family.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.149
I don't know, you know?

34:21.440 --> 34:22.953
But...

34:24.960 --> 34:26.279
...I'm gonna go away.

34:29.199 --> 34:32.636
Give things a chance
to go back to normal for you.

34:33.199 --> 34:36.987
Because I know
as long as I'm here, they won't.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.431
But I need to know one thing
before I go.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.710
Can you forgive me?

34:58.080 --> 34:59.638
Yeah.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.474
Yes.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.392
Luke...

35:13.960 --> 35:15.154
...I'll miss you.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.997
Who would've thought
when you moved to town...

35:46.160 --> 35:48.435
...that I'd be the one who had to leave?

35:48.600 --> 35:51.637
I thought I was gonna live in Newport
my whole life.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.916
So you'll start a new life.

35:54.560 --> 35:57.279
Yeah, maybe I'll show up in Portland...

35:57.960 --> 36:01.316
...and fall for the chick dating
the captain of the football team.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.311
And he can kick your ass.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.471
Yeah.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.551
Welcome to Portland, bitch.

36:11.480 --> 36:14.552
Well, I'll e-mail you.
Maybe I'll drop back in...

36:14.720 --> 36:16.438
...say hey.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.114
Good luck, man.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.751
Want me to take you home?

36:41.760 --> 36:44.433
I hate her so much.

36:44.840 --> 36:48.628
I mean, she tried to drive you out.
She almost destroyed my dad.

36:48.800 --> 36:51.360
She nearly killed Luke.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.030
I have to do something.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.353
Okay.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.351
So where we going?

37:09.560 --> 37:10.959
Marissa. Hello.

37:11.720 --> 37:14.234
Come in. Is everything all right?

37:14.760 --> 37:16.910
Actually, no, it's not.

37:17.680 --> 37:20.717
We need to talk about my mom.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.998
I was just thinking the same thing.
Sit down, please.

37:25.480 --> 37:28.358
I know things between you
and your mom have been rocky this year.

37:28.520 --> 37:32.957
- Can you both put the past behind you?
- You have no idea what she's like...

37:33.120 --> 37:35.315
...or what she's done.
- I know.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.159
I know.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.958
Everything.

37:41.280 --> 37:44.829
We should use this occasion
as a chance to heal.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.556
Make a fresh start.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.639
Family is very important to me, Marissa.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.189
I want us all to be a real family.

37:53.360 --> 37:56.352
- Your sister deserves that, so do you.
- We already have a dad.

37:56.520 --> 38:00.035
I'm well aware. I'm not trying
to replace him, push him out.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.714
Quite the opposite, in fact.
As of today...

38:02.880 --> 38:06.714
...I'm the only chance your father has.
- What are you talking about?

38:06.880 --> 38:09.599
This morning I offered to buy
the Balboa Lighthouse...

38:09.760 --> 38:13.070
...from both he and Sandy
for several million dollars.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.788
Considering the fact that the restaurant
will never open, make a cent...

38:18.960 --> 38:23.397
...I'd say it was a pretty good deal.
However, if I were to change my mind...

38:23.560 --> 38:26.791
...decide it was a bad investment,
lose my checkbook...

38:27.680 --> 38:29.636
...your father would be ruined.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.472
Penniless.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.112
Run out of town.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.078
Which is where I come in.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.197
You are very important to your mother.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.069
She is very important to me.

38:42.760 --> 38:45.957
- Be part of our family.
- Which means what, exactly?

38:46.120 --> 38:49.430
Well, you're already part of the wedding.
When your mom moves in...

38:49.600 --> 38:52.273
...you come and live with us too.
- You're joking, right?

38:52.440 --> 38:53.919
It would mean everything to her.

39:05.600 --> 39:09.957
And if I do this, then you'll
definitely buy the restaurant?

39:10.120 --> 39:12.714
This conversation would have
to remain confidential.

39:13.080 --> 39:16.959
You wouldn't want my mom to know
you blackmailed me into living with her?

39:23.520 --> 39:25.112
So do we have a deal?

39:29.040 --> 39:33.636
Wonderful. Now, was there something
else that you wanted to ask me about?

39:43.600 --> 39:46.558
- You okay?
- I'm a prisoner in my own life. I'm great.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.280
- Well, you did what you needed to do.
- Yeah.

39:49.440 --> 39:53.877
- I guess I just need some sleep.
- Yeah, okay. I'll call you...

39:55.080 --> 39:57.913
I told you, no touching anything, ever.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.394
- You're such a dandy, Cohen.
- You're a dandy, woman.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.198
- Fine, take it.
- No. I don't want it.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.351
Oh, my God!

40:19.600 --> 40:21.955
Those are tears of joy, yes?

40:24.040 --> 40:25.598
I...

40:26.000 --> 40:28.833
I don't even know what to say.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.756
Summer did all the building.

40:32.160 --> 40:35.596
And the heavy lifting. And the wiring
of the electronics. But I painted.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.671
I know you're a Paris fan.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.876
It's amazing.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.110
This is so cool.

40:42.280 --> 40:45.352
We looked through your toys
and couldn't find any plastic horses...

40:45.520 --> 40:48.432
...but we did find this.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.034
Share Bear! Wow!

40:51.200 --> 40:53.668
Yeah, she'll watch over you
with her Care Bear stare.

40:53.840 --> 40:55.671
How do you know
about the Care Bear stare?

40:56.520 --> 40:58.397
- I painted that.
- Yes, you did.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.152
I did.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.437
Thanks, you guys.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.273
- I really needed this.
- Yeah, it was nothing.

41:09.760 --> 41:13.673
For you.
You should see Cohen with a power saw.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.671
How do you know about
the Care Bear stare?

41:15.840 --> 41:17.910
- Dude, leave it alone.
- No, I'm just curious.

41:18.080 --> 41:21.231
- Isn't he cute?
- It's like... It's kind of...
