PENN: <i>From the Penn &amp; Teller</i>
<i>Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada,</i>

00:24.933 --> 00:28.500
<i>here's our host, Jonathan Ross.</i>

00:28.567 --> 00:30.433
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:35.067 --> 00:37.533
Thank you, you're very kind. Thank you.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.900
Welcome to <i>Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us,</i>

00:42.967 --> 00:48.100
the only network show that doesn't ask you
to believe in witches, dragons, wizards,

00:48.167 --> 00:51.200
or all that other cool stuff
in Tom Cruise's religion.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.800
And speaking of little Tom,

00:54.867 --> 00:57.367
all our acts tonight face
a real-life <i>Mission: Impossible.</i>

00:57.433 --> 01:00.833
They have to try to fool
two of the greatest magicians of our time.

01:01.067 --> 01:03.733
Now, should they manage
to achieve that incredible feat,

01:03.800 --> 01:05.867
they will earn a starring guest spot

01:05.933 --> 01:08.600
in Penn and Teller's
long-running Vegas spectacular.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.867
Now let's meet the men
whose legend is even bigger

01:13.933 --> 01:15.267
than their billboards around Vegas.

01:15.333 --> 01:18.367
And they're huge, they're enormous,
much bigger than Criss Angel's.

01:18.433 --> 01:19.433
His are tiny.

01:19.567 --> 01:21.667
Please go crazy for Penn and Teller.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.400
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:24.467 --> 01:26.733
(UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

01:27.800 --> 01:30.967
Mr. Teller, great to see you.
Great to have you here.

01:31.033 --> 01:33.833
Here they are, Penn and Teller,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.567
(CHEERING)

01:36.567 --> 01:38.400
Backstage, I've spoken
to some of the guys.

01:38.467 --> 01:40.067
Some of them are very, very nervous.

01:40.133 --> 01:42.300
Some are sweating.
Some have their heart racing.

01:42.367 --> 01:45.000
One or two said
they've lost the ability to speak.

01:45.067 --> 01:46.933
-Have you ever been nervous in that way?
-(MOUTHING)

01:47.000 --> 01:48.100
#@*! no.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.900
(LAUGHING)

01:49.967 --> 01:51.433
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:56.400 --> 01:58.167
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's Penn and Teller.

01:58.233 --> 02:00.700
You get yourselves comfortable, gentlemen.

02:00.767 --> 02:02.633
-(LAUGHING)
-(APPLAUSE)

02:06.267 --> 02:07.900
Penn and Teller.

02:09.199 --> 02:11.700
Let's meet our first potential fooler.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.800
<i>I'm Leon Etienne from Utica, New York.</i>

02:16.867 --> 02:18.933
And I'm Romy Low
from Melbourne, Australia.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.133
And we are Leon and Romy,
America's rock illusionists.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.400
I think what makes our magic unique

02:24.467 --> 02:28.100
is we bring both of our very strong
personalities to everything we do.

02:28.167 --> 02:31.200
<i>We have a lot of fast-paced illusions,</i>
<i>a lot of fast-paced magic,</i>

02:31.267 --> 02:33.100
so it's basically a magic show...

02:33.167 --> 02:34.467
ROMY: <i>With a rock concert.</i>

02:34.533 --> 02:38.533
When I first met Leon,
I thought he was incredibly cocky,

02:38.600 --> 02:41.433
<i>and his confidence, I think,</i>
<i>rubbed off on me,</i>

02:41.500 --> 02:45.133
and then we ended up
to just really get along really well

02:45.200 --> 02:49.100
and fell in love with a magician,
and then my life changed forever.

02:49.167 --> 02:51.367
I think Penn and Teller
are absolutely incredible.

02:51.433 --> 02:54.067
-But we're a cuter couple.
-Yeah, we're cuter.

02:54.467 --> 02:55.500
(GIGGLES)

02:55.567 --> 02:56.733
(APPLAUSE)

02:56.800 --> 02:59.600
Will you please welcome Leon and Romy?

02:59.867 --> 03:01.467
(APPLAUSE)

03:05.533 --> 03:07.500
-My name's Leon.
-And I'm Romy.

03:07.567 --> 03:10.400
And it is an honor to be here
at <i>Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us.</i>

03:10.467 --> 03:11.500
It really is.

03:11.567 --> 03:14.500
Both Leon and I are each holding
a clear plastic bag,

03:14.567 --> 03:17.400
each containing
10 different decks of cards.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.633
That's 20 different decks of cards.

03:19.700 --> 03:24.467
Which gives us 1,040 cards
for Mr. Jonathan Ross to choose from.

03:24.533 --> 03:26.100
Jonathan, please join me
over here onstage.

03:26.167 --> 03:28.733
-Let's hear it for Jonathan!
-(APPLAUSE)

03:28.800 --> 03:31.100
-Thank you, sir.
-My pleasure, my pleasure. It's exciting.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.400
Very exciting.

03:32.767 --> 03:35.100
Teller, point to a bag of cards.

03:36.267 --> 03:39.833
Mine? Ah, I'm so excited.
I was really hoping you would pick me.

03:39.900 --> 03:43.133
That means that everything
that Leon is holding is useless.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.367
Done.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.867
Jonathan, please select one deck of cards.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.567
The choice is 100% yours,
but whichever deck you choose...

03:51.633 --> 03:53.200
LEON: Is the one we will use.
ROMY: Ah!

03:53.267 --> 03:55.533
And you got this
nifty-looking deck of cards.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.133
Can you hold on to the box for me?

03:57.200 --> 03:59.333
We're going to start
by shuffling the cards,

03:59.400 --> 04:03.567
so we know we're starting with
a well-mixed pack of playing cards.

04:03.633 --> 04:06.467
And, Jonathan, if you wouldn't mind,
please reach in there and touch a card.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.600
-Okay.
-Any one. Doesn't matter.

04:08.667 --> 04:09.800
-That one? Take it, take it.
-Okay.

04:09.867 --> 04:11.600
And it's okay if I see it.
You can show it to me.

04:11.667 --> 04:12.733
I'm not showing it to you.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.967
-You got to show it to me.
-Show it to us.

04:14.033 --> 04:15.100
Where's the fun in that? Where's the...

04:15.167 --> 04:17.533
-Show it to them, at least.
-Let's see, what...

04:17.600 --> 04:21.267
The 10 of Diamonds. So, folks,
Jonathan got the 10 of Diamonds.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.700
And to make this official,
we're gonna have you put your name on it.

04:23.767 --> 04:26.633
So take this marker and sign your name
on the face of that card.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.500
This is the only one
you've ever signed for us, correct, sir?

04:28.567 --> 04:29.700
-It certainly is.
-Correct.

04:29.767 --> 04:32.167
-And I will take that back.
-So there we go, guys.

04:32.233 --> 04:34.767
Ten of Diamonds
with Jonathan's signature.

04:34.833 --> 04:35.933
We're now going to take that card

04:36.000 --> 04:37.733
and, Jonathan,
can you confirm for everybody out there

04:37.800 --> 04:39.967
that I am shuffling
this pack of playing cards

04:40.033 --> 04:44.133
and that we are mixing your card
amongst all these other cards?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.233
ROSS: Fully shuffled.
LEON: Perfect.

04:46.300 --> 04:49.000
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
Penn and Teller, Jonathan,

04:49.067 --> 04:52.433
the idea here is to now try
and find Jonathan's card.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.633
But I want to do this in a unique way

04:54.700 --> 04:57.533
and a really dangerous way,
actually, as well.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.767
In fact, this is so dangerous

04:58.833 --> 05:02.100
that the producers were worried
about Jonathan's safety,

05:02.167 --> 05:07.067
so they actually asked me
to provide him with a safety helmet.

05:07.133 --> 05:11.400
But, Jonathan, this is Las Vegas,
so we have something a little different.

05:11.733 --> 05:13.133
(LAUGHTER)

05:13.667 --> 05:15.267
-(APPLAUSE)
-Go ahead, man.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.767
For me? Okay.

05:19.867 --> 05:22.933
-LEON: Do you feel safe, sir?
-I'm channeling my inner showgirl.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.867
LEON: (LAUGHING) You look wonderful.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.800
(ALL LAUGHING)

05:27.367 --> 05:30.900
-(APPLAUSE)
-Take a seat. Go, go.

05:31.467 --> 05:33.267
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

05:33.900 --> 05:35.000
LEON: Romy?
ROMY: All right.

05:35.067 --> 05:36.500
As Leon said earlier,

05:36.567 --> 05:40.433
the trick that we are about to perform
is actually incredibly dangerous,

05:40.500 --> 05:42.600
and we do need a few more items.

05:42.667 --> 05:45.833
The first one's been sitting center stage
the entire show.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.500
It's this ramp.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.633
Now, guys, this ramp
is not going to make sense to you

05:49.700 --> 05:51.433
until I introduce this next person.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.600
This is our friend Jason from Las Vegas.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.400
-(APPLAUSE)
-He is a professional skateboarder.

05:55.467 --> 05:58.367
Jason, thank you for joining us.
Are you ready to help us out today?

06:00.700 --> 06:02.633
Ladies and gentlemen,
we take the packet of cards,

06:02.700 --> 06:05.933
we split it into two,
so Romy has a packet, I have a packet.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.267
Um, Jonathan,
your card's in one of these packets.

06:09.333 --> 06:14.167
Here's where it gets very interesting.
Romy and I are going to sit on the stage.

06:14.233 --> 06:15.767
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to need your help.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.400
I'm going to say, "Go." When I say, "Go,"

06:17.467 --> 06:20.733
I would ask that you all together count,
"Three, two, one."

06:20.800 --> 06:24.000
Now when you get to one,
Jason is going to come flying over us,

06:24.067 --> 06:26.300
in mid-air,
we're going to spring these cards.

06:26.367 --> 06:30.367
He's going to reach in mid-air
like a skateboarding flying ninja...

06:30.433 --> 06:31.867
-Hiyah!
-Hiyah!

06:31.933 --> 06:35.033
...and catch Jonathan's signed card
in mid-air.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.667
Pretty good. Are you guys ready?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.200
-ALL: Yeah!
-Jason.

06:38.267 --> 06:41.500
Are you ready, Jason?
All right. Ready? Go.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.967
ALL: Three, two, one!

06:44.367 --> 06:45.733
Come on, baby.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.800
-(APPLAUSE)
-Yes!

06:49.500 --> 06:53.833
Jason, come over here
and bring us the signed card, please.

06:53.900 --> 06:57.667
-Oh, I didn't get it. Didn't catch it.
-You... You're serious?

06:57.733 --> 06:59.633
-Yeah, I didn't get it.
-Really?

06:59.733 --> 07:01.633
Well, it was
a heck of a jump anyway, right?

07:01.700 --> 07:02.933
Yeah.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.300
Thanks, man. Thanks.

07:05.367 --> 07:07.200
Uh, Jonathan,
can you please come over here

07:07.267 --> 07:09.500
and help us find your card on the floor?

07:10.400 --> 07:13.467
Guys, I'll be honest with you.
It would have been too easy

07:13.533 --> 07:17.067
to have Jason fly in mid-air
and catch that playing card.

07:17.467 --> 07:22.600
The hard part of this trick
was actually getting the signed card

07:23.033 --> 07:24.700
on the bottom of the skateboard.

07:24.767 --> 07:26.133
-Jonathan, is that your card?
-ROSS: That is my card.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.367
ROMY: And your signature.

07:27.433 --> 07:28.833
-And your handwriting?
-That is my card.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.333
-It is. Thank you, I'm Leon.
-And I'm Romy.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.800
LEON: Thank you.

07:34.967 --> 07:36.400
Penn and Teller are going to
talk about what they saw

07:36.467 --> 07:39.333
and see whether or not they know
how you did what you just did.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.900
Is it something
they would have seen before,

07:40.967 --> 07:43.133
maybe in a different form,
or is this a brand-new illusion?

07:43.200 --> 07:45.133
Probably, maybe in a different form.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.833
I mean, there's a lot of tricks
that are like this

07:47.900 --> 07:52.067
where it's basically a signed card
going to an impossible location.

07:52.133 --> 07:53.167
We'll see how we did.

07:53.233 --> 07:55.233
Well, it worked, certainly,
in fooling us, I think.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.000
Whether or not you fooled
the two maestros, I don't know.

07:57.067 --> 07:59.100
I might take this hat off
because I'm, A...

07:59.167 --> 08:00.300
-Hurt your neck?
-...getting a headache,

08:00.367 --> 08:02.900
and, B, I'm thinking about
having an operation, so...

08:02.967 --> 08:05.367
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-Penn, take it away.

08:05.433 --> 08:09.900
You know, what we do in magic,
the major job to do in magic

08:10.000 --> 08:14.267
is to take card tricks and try desperately
to make them interesting.

08:14.967 --> 08:18.300
That is what...
That is the grail we're all looking for,

08:18.367 --> 08:21.033
and I think you've got your finger
on that grail very, very well.

08:21.267 --> 08:25.967
The one thing that led us
to be able to, we think, figure this out,

08:26.667 --> 08:30.167
is, uh, how interesting it is

08:30.633 --> 08:33.667
to watch you walk across the stage.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.533
-You walk so nicely...
-Thank you.

08:36.600 --> 08:40.433
...across the stage
that we could not take our eyes off you.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.667
Hey, Penn, one minute.

08:41.732 --> 08:45.633
I was walking around,
and I'm wearing a hat, and I get nothing.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.067
-LEON: It's a hard business.
-You were more interesting to watch

08:48.167 --> 08:54.433
walk across the stage than Jonathan was,
and therein lies why you didn't fool us.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.800
Okay, so you're saying because Romy
was kind of heading over there

08:57.867 --> 09:00.333
while other stuff was going on elsewhere,
you were keeping an eye on her,

09:00.400 --> 09:03.133
that they didn't fool you,
that the trick was in some way dependent

09:03.200 --> 09:04.867
-on what Romy was doing?
-Yes.

09:04.933 --> 09:09.700
Okay, would that be the correct solution
to what happened?

09:10.300 --> 09:11.800
-That is not correct.
-Not correct.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.233
-(AUDIENCE GASPS)
-Okay.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.767
This is the way
you could have done the trick.

09:16.267 --> 09:19.200
When he picked the card,
which the card was a real selection.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.767
You did not force the card
out of the real decks.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.400
-That was all real, you could have...
-Right.

09:23.467 --> 09:26.667
...and we watched you
control that to the top,

09:26.733 --> 09:30.067
you could have handed her
the card with the box,

09:30.233 --> 09:32.900
she could've walked across the stage,
left it over there,

09:32.967 --> 09:35.567
it could have been copped over there,
walked across,

09:35.633 --> 09:37.433
-put on to the bottom of the skateboard...
-LEON: Absolutely.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.833
...then he could've brought it out
and done that.

09:38.900 --> 09:39.900
-Yes.
-Yes, it would have.

09:39.967 --> 09:41.000
PENN: But you didn't do it that way?

09:41.067 --> 09:42.067
-We did not do that.
-No.

09:42.133 --> 09:43.567
Okay, then you fooled us.

09:43.633 --> 09:45.733
-Yes!
-ROSS: Come on.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.633
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
-(ROSS LAUGHS)

09:47.700 --> 09:49.067
That was the most awkward...

09:49.133 --> 09:50.533
So I jumped the gun.
That was so exciting.

09:50.667 --> 09:51.700
Thank you.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.500
LEON: Wow.
ROMY: Oh, my God.

09:53.567 --> 09:55.667
-Oh!
-Oh, my God, thank you so much.

09:55.733 --> 09:58.333
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.433
Thank you, thank you.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.267
-Las Vegas, baby!
-Whoo!

10:02.333 --> 10:04.067
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

10:04.667 --> 10:06.067
(LEON LAUGHS)

10:06.133 --> 10:08.233
Ladies and gentlemen,
they fooled Penn and Teller.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.567
Romy and Leon, Leon and Romy,
congratulations,

10:10.633 --> 10:12.067
you're coming back to Vegas
as part of the show.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.333
-Let's hear it again.
-Yes!

10:13.400 --> 10:15.067
What a day! Congratulations.

10:15.133 --> 10:17.167
-Thank you so much.
-Romy and Leon, ladies and gentlemen.

10:17.233 --> 10:18.667
Leon and Romy.

10:22.067 --> 10:24.700
So far tonight, one magician
has fooled Penn and Teller

10:24.767 --> 10:26.400
and earned a trip back here to Vegas.

10:26.467 --> 10:29.600
So let's meet our next contender
and see if they're up to the task.

10:33.267 --> 10:34.600
<i>Hi, I am Mike Hammer,</i>

10:34.667 --> 10:37.600
<i>and I do a comedy magic show</i>
<i>here in Las Vegas five days a week.</i>

10:37.667 --> 10:39.433
I've been doing magic
ever since I was a kid.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.667
I thought it was cool back then,
and now it's... Eh, it's okay.

10:42.733 --> 10:44.067
Have you ever seen this one?

10:44.133 --> 10:45.700
<i>I will tell you, though,</i>
<i>the cool thing about magic</i>

10:45.767 --> 10:47.100
is it really does get you the chicks.

10:47.433 --> 10:48.700
How about...

10:49.233 --> 10:50.500
Chicks love the magic.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.700
They usually come out the other end.
You want to see that?

10:52.767 --> 10:54.433
-(RECORD SCRATCHING)
-I'm just saying. They're cards.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.500
I still got it.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.367
<i>Penn and Teller</i>
<i>are the best in the business.</i>

11:00.433 --> 11:02.600
<i>The one reason</i>
<i>I think I can fool Penn and Teller</i>

11:02.733 --> 11:05.267
is this is Vegas, and I'm gambling

11:05.333 --> 11:07.600
<i>that they've been too busy</i>
<i>to focus on the latest methods.</i>

11:08.200 --> 11:09.467
We'll see.

11:09.967 --> 11:11.300
(APPLAUSE)

11:13.200 --> 11:15.267
So, time to have some fun.

11:15.567 --> 11:18.333
This next performer
doesn't take his magic seriously

11:18.400 --> 11:21.233
or his career seriously
since he's a magician in the first place.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.767
-(LAUGHTER)
-Will you please welcome Mike Hammer?

11:23.833 --> 11:25.733
-(APPLAUSE)
-All right!

11:25.800 --> 11:27.167
Thank you.

11:28.667 --> 11:31.033
Thank you so much.
That was well-rehearsed applause.

11:31.600 --> 11:36.233
Tonight, what I'm about to show you is
brand-new unless you've seen me before.

11:36.300 --> 11:37.933
We do need someone from the audience.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.933
Don't look the other way
like I can't see you, sir.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.567
-You, what's your name?
-Kyle.

11:42.633 --> 11:44.633
Kyle, come up.
Give it up for Kyle, everybody.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.433
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

11:46.500 --> 11:49.867
How you doing, sir?
Look at you. You look like a professional.

11:49.933 --> 11:51.700
-Oh, yeah.
-Just don't screw it up, all right?

11:51.767 --> 11:53.467
Stand over here. This is Kyle, everybody.

11:53.533 --> 11:56.333
Listen, Kyle, have you ever been
on a blind date before?

11:56.400 --> 11:57.900
-No.
-No. You're not on one now?

11:57.967 --> 11:59.567
Okay, all right, all right.

11:59.733 --> 12:02.133
Look, I'm going
on a blind date, and actually,

12:02.200 --> 12:04.767
this is what she's supposed
to look like right over here.

12:04.833 --> 12:07.667
She told me that's what she looks like,
so we'll see what happens.

12:07.733 --> 12:09.333
Now, it's not important
what a woman looks like.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.067
What's important, Kyle,
is the way they're dressed.

12:12.167 --> 12:14.200
And that's where you come in.
Do you know women's clothing?

12:14.267 --> 12:15.633
-Not really.
-Not really.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.033
Well, I've got over here
some markers, all right?

12:18.100 --> 12:20.567
And I want you to just go ahead
and choose five markers.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.033
-All right.
-Five markers.

12:22.100 --> 12:25.467
Different-colored makers would be good.
There you go. Two... Oh, you're quick.

12:25.733 --> 12:27.700
-What do you do for a living there, Kyle?
-Landscaping.

12:27.767 --> 12:29.533
Landscaping. Wow. That's fun.

12:30.133 --> 12:32.333
So go ahead. Go ahead.

12:32.833 --> 12:34.233
There you go, that's probably...

12:34.300 --> 12:35.933
Yeah, okay, there you go.
Okay, good, good, good.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.167
We're just going to place them over here.

12:37.233 --> 12:40.800
I'm going to ask you to stand
right over there in front of the...

12:40.867 --> 12:43.900
This bin over here. This trash bin.
And now listen up, Kyle. Here's the...

12:43.967 --> 12:45.033
Oh, you don't have to
roll your sleeves up.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.967
I'll be doing the magic.
It's cool, though, all right?

12:47.067 --> 12:49.933
Right over here. This is a blind date.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.033
It is a blind date
that we're going to be going on,

12:52.100 --> 12:54.533
so one of us needs to be blind, all right?

12:54.600 --> 12:57.300
-Okay.
-Yeah, sounds exciting for a landscaper.

12:57.367 --> 13:00.833
Want you to go ahead and take this tape,
seal your eyes shut so you can't see.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.733
-All right.
-I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

13:02.800 --> 13:03.933
(ALL LAUGHING)

13:04.000 --> 13:05.667
What kind of freak are you? My God.

13:05.733 --> 13:08.700
All right, so, did you see that?
He was, like, going to do it, too.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.767
It's crazy. You're my kind of landscaper.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.900
Hold that in your right hand.
Hold this in your left hand.

13:12.967 --> 13:14.367
Don't get the tape
stuck next to each other.

13:14.433 --> 13:15.833
I don't know where I will get more tape,

13:15.900 --> 13:16.933
-all right?
-All right.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.533
I'm going to seal my eyes shut, all right?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.667
'Cause I don't want to see
what you're about to color over here.

13:20.733 --> 13:21.733
Okay.

13:22.600 --> 13:26.000
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-Yeah. It's like Botox.

13:27.033 --> 13:28.267
Maybe a face-lift.

13:28.333 --> 13:31.400
Here, let me take this from you, Kyle,
all right?

13:31.767 --> 13:34.833
Don't do that move unless
your hair is permanently affixed.

13:34.900 --> 13:37.067
Look, there we go. All right.

13:37.367 --> 13:38.667
-Let me take that last piece of tape.
-There you go.

13:38.733 --> 13:40.167
-Is this the sticky side? I can't tell.
-Yes.

13:40.233 --> 13:42.733
-I'm kidding, Kyle. I kid.
-(LAUGHTER)

13:44.567 --> 13:45.667
All right.

13:45.733 --> 13:48.667
Hey, don't get up and leave,
people, all right?

13:48.733 --> 13:50.900
Yeah, I know what that sounds like now.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.333
-Kyle, come over here, buddy.
-All right.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.600
-Is this your shoulder?
-Yes.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.367
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
Screwed up big-time last night.

13:56.433 --> 13:57.900
(ALL LAUGHING)

13:57.967 --> 13:59.667
Had the wrong landscaper.

13:59.733 --> 14:02.933
So feel around my face.
Make sure that tape's on pretty good.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.267
-All right.
-You don't have to poke

14:04.333 --> 14:07.100
in the eye sockets, Kyle. Okay.

14:07.167 --> 14:09.533
Kyle, reach in the cup.
Take one marker out of the cup.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.800
Let me know
when you've got it in your hand.

14:10.867 --> 14:11.867
Got it.

14:11.933 --> 14:13.400
Go ahead and color in.
Do you see her shirt?

14:13.467 --> 14:14.467
-Yes.
-Color it in.

14:14.533 --> 14:16.833
Do it as fast as you can,
but keep within the lines.

14:16.900 --> 14:20.200
When you're done, put the marker
inside that waste bin below by your feet.

14:20.267 --> 14:22.233
-Do you see it? Do you see the bin?
-Yes.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.400
-All right, are you still coloring?
-Yeah, I'm done.

14:24.467 --> 14:26.933
-Okay. Did you drop it in the bin?
-Yep.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.067
Take out another marker.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.800
Let me know when you've got
that marker in your hand.

14:29.867 --> 14:31.167
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:31.233 --> 14:33.867
-Go ahead and color. Do you see her belt?
-Yes.

14:33.933 --> 14:36.967
Color in her belt, all right?
Color in her belt. Do a thorough job.

14:37.033 --> 14:38.900
When you're done,
put the marker inside the bin.

14:39.233 --> 14:41.133
You don't work for the post office
on the side, do you?

14:41.200 --> 14:42.633
-No.
-Okay, as you can see,

14:42.700 --> 14:43.900
this is not set up, folks.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.633
I would have chosen someone
who could color quicker.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.200
(LAUGHING)

14:48.800 --> 14:50.433
-Throw it in the bin when you're done.
-All done.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.700
You done? Take out another one.

14:52.767 --> 14:53.967
-Okay.
-Any one you like.

14:54.033 --> 14:55.033
-You got one?
-Yep.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.000
Color in her hair.
Can you guys see the picture,

14:57.067 --> 14:58.367
or is he blocking it?

14:58.433 --> 14:59.800
-You're blocking it.
-Which way?

14:59.867 --> 15:02.300
Poor stage presence.
Move over just a little bit.

15:02.367 --> 15:03.667
Did you finish the hair?

15:03.733 --> 15:06.133
-Uh, no, not yet.
-Okay. Take your time.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.433
I got to let you folks know,
out of all the audiences I've ever had,

15:09.500 --> 15:12.567
you are the most recent,
so thank you so much

15:12.633 --> 15:14.433
-for being here.
-(APPLAUSE)

15:14.500 --> 15:15.800
-Are you done?
-Yes, all done.

15:15.867 --> 15:18.100
All right, that applause
should fill in that gap of...

15:18.167 --> 15:19.733
Right there, drop it in the bin.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.533
Take out another marker.
We're almost there, Kyle.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.600
-All right.
-All right.

15:22.667 --> 15:23.667
-And you got one?
-Yep.

15:23.733 --> 15:25.933
Go ahead and color in her shorts,
all right?

15:26.000 --> 15:29.233
Color in her shorts.
And, uh, you don't have to style her.

15:29.300 --> 15:32.267
Just color it in.
It will be quicker that way. All right?

15:32.333 --> 15:33.500
And, uh, then how many...

15:33.567 --> 15:35.100
-We have one marker left, yes?
-All right.

15:35.167 --> 15:36.500
-One marker left?
-Yes.

15:36.567 --> 15:38.500
Kyle, any form of communication
would be helpful.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.633
-(KYLE CHUCKLES)
-Okay, color in both sides.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.767
-Let's give him a...
-(APPLAUSE)

15:44.367 --> 15:47.667
While he's finishing up that picture
over there, I'm going to remove the tape.

15:47.733 --> 15:50.500
This is my least favorite
portion of the show

15:50.567 --> 15:52.967
since Kyle stuck it in my hairline.

15:53.033 --> 15:54.533
(LAUGHTER)

15:54.600 --> 15:58.333
(GROANS) All right.
One more week, no more eyebrows.

15:59.033 --> 16:01.100
You should get into tape, sir.

16:03.133 --> 16:05.333
This is good. So you went with red hair,

16:05.400 --> 16:08.400
blue shirt, yellow belt, purple shorts,
and green socks.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.800
So these are the colors you chose.

16:10.867 --> 16:13.267
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce you

16:13.333 --> 16:15.500
to my blind date.

16:15.567 --> 16:17.967
You may recognize her by her picture.

16:19.700 --> 16:21.100
(LAUGHTER)

16:24.067 --> 16:27.033
I'd blow her up by mouth,
but it's my first date.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.467
(LAUGHTER)

16:29.133 --> 16:34.367
Red hair, blue shirt, yellow belt,
purple shorts, and green socks!

16:34.600 --> 16:35.967
(CHEERING)

16:37.367 --> 16:38.633
It's the same.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.267
And I'm not seeing anybody else
tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.200
Tell you what, you can have her.
I'll take this one.

16:49.267 --> 16:51.400
I need her for the carpool lane.
Thank you very much.

16:51.467 --> 16:53.633
Kyle, everybody. Thank you so much, Kyle.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.667
ROSS: Mike Hammer, ladies and gentlemen.

16:55.733 --> 16:57.433
-That was terrific.
-Thank you, thank you.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.233
Very funny.
Really intrigued on how you did that.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.200
And it's hard to tell how old she is.

17:02.267 --> 17:03.767
Well, she's had a lot
of plastic surgery, so...

17:03.833 --> 17:06.633
Okay, okay. She's sort of deflating a bit.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.567
-Should I blow somewhere?
-She is deflating, yeah.

17:08.633 --> 17:09.933
-That's her ego.
-Okay.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-The fellows are conferring.

17:13.067 --> 17:14.900
I know they enjoyed it
and the audience enjoyed it.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.000
-But I think they...
-I'm hoping they weren't paying attention.

17:17.067 --> 17:18.267
Okay. Okay.

17:18.333 --> 17:20.532
Okay, the gentlemen,
I think they're good to go,

17:20.599 --> 17:21.599
from the look of things. Penn.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.267
What a great, great presentation.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.099
Oh, thank you so much.
Oh, this, yeah, thank you.

17:27.166 --> 17:30.033
-A great presentation of that trick.
-Of that trick.

17:30.100 --> 17:33.467
PENN: As we've said,
it's a great presentation of that trick.

17:33.533 --> 17:35.800
-Already you get a little nervous.
-Yeah.

17:35.867 --> 17:38.467
But I will tell you,
and you can just stop me...

17:38.533 --> 17:39.900
-Stop!
-...whenever you want.

17:39.967 --> 17:43.200
-(LAUGHTER)
-Uh, you like cartoons?

17:44.067 --> 17:46.367
-Yes, I like cartoons.
-Yeah, everyone likes cartoons.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.533
You like cartoon rabbits?

17:49.833 --> 17:53.267
Yeah, you like Bugs Bunny, right?
You like Bugs Bunny?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.067
-Yes.
-PENN: That's a cartoon rabbit.

17:55.133 --> 17:58.133
There's another cartoon rabbit,

17:58.400 --> 18:02.500
kind of named after the...
The thing they do with the...

18:02.567 --> 18:05.067
Anyway, these guys are
fantastic performers.

18:05.133 --> 18:06.867
(LAUGHING)

18:06.933 --> 18:08.933
-PENN: That enough of a hint for you?
-You got it, you got it.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.867
-Okay.
-ROSS: Mr. Mike Hammer.

18:10.933 --> 18:12.900
-Well done, great performance. I loved it.
-Thank you.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.900
-Thank you so much.
-I know you loved it.

18:16.133 --> 18:18.267
Let's meet our next contender.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.067
My name is Shin Lim.
I live in Boston, Massachusetts.

18:24.133 --> 18:26.767
I originally went to college
for piano performance.

18:26.833 --> 18:30.100
<i>Unfortunately, midway through,</i>
<i>I got carpal tunnel in both hands,</i>

18:30.167 --> 18:33.767
<i>and because of that, I just decided</i>
<i>to pursue magic as my main career.</i>

18:33.833 --> 18:34.967
(LAUGHING)

18:35.033 --> 18:39.133
<i>I think all the years of performing piano</i>
<i>and learning music theory</i>

18:39.200 --> 18:41.667
<i>really influenced my magic in a sense that</i>

18:41.733 --> 18:47.000
I naturally was able to synchronize
my magic to the music,

18:47.067 --> 18:51.333
so every beat, every movement
is justified through the music.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.967
By not speaking during my act,

18:54.033 --> 18:57.000
<i>it almost gives a more mysterious look.</i>

18:57.067 --> 18:59.667
I want the world to see
a different side of magic,

18:59.733 --> 19:03.033
<i>to take magic seriously,</i>
<i>and respect the art.</i>

19:03.633 --> 19:05.067
(APPLAUSE)

19:07.367 --> 19:11.200
We've already asked two randomly selected
members of our audience

19:11.267 --> 19:13.733
to join our next performer
onstage in advance.

19:13.800 --> 19:17.800
Now, prepare yourself to experience
the magic of Shin Lim.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.267
(APPLAUSE)

19:19.967 --> 19:21.867

25:41.800 --> 25:44.067
ROSS: Shin Lim, ladies and gentlemen.
Wow.

25:44.133 --> 25:45.867
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

25:45.933 --> 25:49.600
Ladies, thank you so much for your help.
You may go back to your seats now.

25:49.667 --> 25:53.000
Let's thank our volunteers.
Thank you so much.

25:53.167 --> 25:57.000
You know, I loved every second of that.
And I know the audience did as well.

25:57.067 --> 25:59.067
I felt like we were
in the church of magic.

25:59.133 --> 26:01.867
And I loved the fact as well
that you cleaned up after yourself.

26:01.933 --> 26:03.867
-I did.
-My mom would have been really, uh,

26:03.933 --> 26:05.100
really proud of you.

26:05.167 --> 26:06.867
So you were a concert pianist,

26:06.933 --> 26:08.800
-but you got the carpal tunnel going on.
-I was, I was.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.833
So first a pianist and then, um,

26:10.900 --> 26:13.267
seven years ago,
I decided to pick up magic,

26:13.333 --> 26:14.500
-and now I'm here.
-So you've done all this...

26:14.567 --> 26:16.967
You've learned that
or created that in seven years.

26:17.033 --> 26:18.633
Wow, that's all the more
remarkable, isn't it?

26:18.700 --> 26:21.167
-I mean, that's just...
-(APPLAUSE)

26:21.433 --> 26:22.733
...extraordinary.

26:22.800 --> 26:26.167
Now, you choose not to speak in the act,
at least not to us. Why that decision?

26:26.233 --> 26:30.700
Uh... I feel like
it's interesting because...

26:30.767 --> 26:33.500
-(LAUGHTER)
-No, I just think it...

26:34.500 --> 26:36.400
-(APPLAUSE)
-(ROSS LAUGHS)

26:36.467 --> 26:37.733
Did you do enough, though,

26:37.800 --> 26:41.000
to fool two of the smartest minds
in magic right there, Penn and Teller?

26:41.067 --> 26:45.000
-I don't know. We'll see.
-Let's find out. Mr. Penn, Mr. Teller.

26:45.067 --> 26:48.267
A lot of people do card tricks.

26:48.833 --> 26:54.867
The idea of doing card tricks,
which are silly at their very core,

26:55.633 --> 27:00.067
really seriously
and really, really importantly,

27:00.733 --> 27:02.300
is wonderful.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.033
And I believe

27:05.167 --> 27:07.900
that is the only use of smoke

27:08.533 --> 27:12.800
I've seen in a magic trick
that was sincerely beautiful.

27:16.733 --> 27:19.400
Now watching this,
you did a lot of tricks.

27:19.533 --> 27:23.167
And I want to tell you
that we caught some stuff that you did.

27:23.233 --> 27:26.900
And there is this theory on magic
that I believe very much, which is,

27:27.167 --> 27:32.267
once one thing is seen to be phony,
the whole thing crumbles.

27:32.367 --> 27:36.400
And it crumbles completely,
so it needs to be perfect or not at all.

27:37.633 --> 27:38.800
But,

27:41.267 --> 27:44.900
at the end of that,
even with the little moves that I saw,

27:46.633 --> 27:49.800
I felt it was perfect.
And as Teller said...

27:49.867 --> 27:51.000
(APPLAUSE)

27:52.933 --> 27:58.667
We didn't even know how you vanished
the motherfucking marker.

27:58.733 --> 28:00.467
-(APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER)
-Yes!

28:00.533 --> 28:02.700
PENN: So you, sir, fooled us.

28:02.867 --> 28:03.933
Wow.

28:05.467 --> 28:07.767
Amazing. Beautiful, beautiful.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.000
Beautiful.

28:12.067 --> 28:14.833
ROSS: Shin Lim, ladies and gentlemen.
He fooled them!

28:14.900 --> 28:16.633
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

28:16.700 --> 28:19.000
PENN: What a beautiful routine there.
So beautiful.

28:19.067 --> 28:20.267
ROSS: Shin Lim.

28:20.333 --> 28:22.967
I'm sure you'll be seeing
a lot more of him.

28:23.533 --> 28:25.767
Well, it's been quite a night
here on <i>Fool Us.</i>

28:25.833 --> 28:29.900
Two acts have managed to fool
the nearly unfoolable Penn and Teller.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.033
Can we make it three?

28:31.100 --> 28:33.433
Let's meet our next contender
and find out.

28:36.067 --> 28:38.900
I'm Peter Boie, and I'm from
the great state of Maine.

28:38.967 --> 28:41.933
<i>When I was three years old,</i>
<i>a magician pulled a quarter from my ear,</i>

28:42.000 --> 28:43.567
<i>and I remember it like it was yesterday.</i>

28:43.633 --> 28:45.367
And that's what got me
interested in magic.

28:45.433 --> 28:48.367
<i>I got paid 50 bucks to do my first show</i>
<i>when I was 15,</i>

28:48.433 --> 28:51.733
and when I was, I don't know, 17,
and I said, "I'm not going to college.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.400
<i>"I'm going to be</i>
<i>a professional magician,"</i>

28:53.467 --> 28:55.533
<i>my parents, they were like, "Okay."</i>

28:55.600 --> 28:56.833
And that was it.

28:57.933 --> 29:01.200
<i>I'm on the road a lot.</i>
<i>Probably 150, 200 days a year.</i>

29:01.267 --> 29:02.367
<i>I love what I do.</i>

29:02.433 --> 29:04.400
If I didn't get paid to do it,
I would still be doing it.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.233
<i>I love that connection with an audience.</i>

29:06.300 --> 29:08.600
<i>It's just this ball of unexplained energy</i>

29:08.667 --> 29:12.100
that happens when your show's
kicking on all cylinders.

29:12.167 --> 29:15.667
I've performed in every state
except Delaware and Hawaii.

29:15.733 --> 29:18.333
If anybody is watching this,
please book me in Hawaii.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.667
(LAUGHTER)

29:19.833 --> 29:21.800
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

29:24.133 --> 29:25.467
Don't worry. We're not being cheap.

29:25.533 --> 29:27.033
We're not trying to
save money on the lighting.

29:27.100 --> 29:29.700
In show business, this is what
we call "atmosphere."

29:29.767 --> 29:31.767
I'm setting the scene
for our next performer.

29:31.833 --> 29:35.500
Welcome to the spooky world of Peter Boie.

29:35.567 --> 29:37.200
(APPLAUSE)

29:37.433 --> 29:39.500
(MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

29:44.233 --> 29:47.467
The spiritualist movement started in 1848.

29:47.533 --> 29:48.900
To prove that spirits were real,

29:48.967 --> 29:50.433
mediums would try
and communicate with them,

29:50.500 --> 29:53.033
and they would communicate back
by writing messages.

29:53.100 --> 29:54.900
A common object at the time
in schoolhouses

29:54.967 --> 29:57.467
were writing slates or chalkboards.

29:59.500 --> 30:02.500
Sort of like these,
which is what we'll use.

30:02.567 --> 30:04.667
I need a couple people to help me out.

30:04.733 --> 30:05.967
(SCATTERED CHEERING)

30:06.033 --> 30:08.167
Would you mind helping me out?
What is your name?

30:08.233 --> 30:09.867
-Melanie.
-Melanie, very nice to meet you.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.467
-Thank you very much for helping out.
-Nice to meet you.

30:11.533 --> 30:13.367
If you would, please have a seat there.

30:13.433 --> 30:16.100
You can give a round of applause
to Melanie.

30:16.167 --> 30:18.600
And one other person.
You, sir, what is your name?

30:18.667 --> 30:19.700
-Bill.
-Bill?

30:19.767 --> 30:21.400
Please give a big round
of applause for Bill.

30:21.467 --> 30:23.367
Come on up here, Bill.

30:25.667 --> 30:27.467
Please have a chair.

30:29.100 --> 30:31.633
Melanie, please take your chalkboard.
I want you to wipe it down.

30:31.733 --> 30:34.200
Make sure there are no marks
on either side.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.100
Make sure there are no marks.
Bill, please do the same.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.800
-Sure.
-Wipe it down on either side.

30:37.867 --> 30:40.167
Yep, just go ahead and give it a wipe.

30:41.033 --> 30:43.433
And I'll take the rag back.
Thank you very much.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.500
Melanie, I'll take the rag back
and the chalkboard.

30:46.567 --> 30:51.200
Now, when they were about to communicate,
they would take a piece of chalk

30:53.633 --> 30:55.300
and slide it in between the chalkboards

30:55.367 --> 30:58.233
in case someone or something
felt like communicating.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.100
Would you mind holding on
to the chalkboard just like this?

31:00.167 --> 31:01.833
Rest them on your lap.
We'll get to them in a bit.

31:02.867 --> 31:06.033
Melanie, close your eyes.
Keep them that way till I tell you.

31:06.333 --> 31:07.900
Over the next minute or so, Melanie,

31:07.967 --> 31:11.467
I need you to concentrate on any
physical experience that happens to you.

31:11.867 --> 31:13.733
Don't be scared and don't move,

31:13.800 --> 31:18.933
but be aware of any sensation,
whether it be hot, cold, tickling,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.267
or anything else that you might feel,
and remember it.

31:45.467 --> 31:47.033
Melanie, open your eyes.
With your left hand,

31:47.100 --> 31:50.233
point to where it felt like
something touched you.

31:50.767 --> 31:53.533
-(AUDIENCE GASPING)
-Your right shoulder.

31:54.033 --> 31:55.667
How many times did you feel it?

31:56.033 --> 31:57.633
-Twice.
-You felt it twice?

31:57.700 --> 31:58.800
Yeah.

31:58.867 --> 32:00.200
Melanie, I didn't touch or come near you.

32:00.267 --> 32:01.967
I actually touched Bill twice
on your right shoulder.

32:02.033 --> 32:04.600
-Isn't that right, Bill?
-Yes, you did.

32:12.500 --> 32:13.800
Bill, before we started,

32:13.867 --> 32:16.633
you guys cleaned those chalkboards, right?
There are no marks left on yours?

32:16.700 --> 32:18.067
-There are no marks left on yours?
-No.

32:18.133 --> 32:20.633
Have you felt anything weird, warm, cold?

32:20.700 --> 32:22.033
-No.
-No?

32:40.067 --> 32:41.167

32:41.233 --> 32:42.300
-No problem.
-I appreciate it.

They were fantastic.

(CHEERING)

32:48.600 --> 32:50.400
ROSS: Peter Boie, ladies and gentlemen.

32:50.467 --> 32:53.700
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
-Good stuff. Wow.

32:54.133 --> 32:56.867
Okay, so Penn and Teller are going
to deliberate as they always do.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.667
Very spooky, great scene setting.
I loved all of that.

32:59.733 --> 33:02.000
When you perform this, normally,
what kind of reactions do you get?

33:02.067 --> 33:04.633
Do people get a bit spooked out?
Do they get creeped out by it?

33:04.700 --> 33:06.167
Yes, they do. Yeah, some... Yeah.

33:06.233 --> 33:11.233
The reactions range from stunned silence
to sometimes a scream or two, you know.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.800
Penn and Teller are ready.
They've had a good talk about it.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.500
Well, you know, uh,

33:16.633 --> 33:21.300
we get asked all the time what
the hardest things to do in magic are.

33:21.367 --> 33:24.100
But one of the hardest things
to do in magic

33:24.167 --> 33:27.800
is to stand centerstage and tell a story

33:27.867 --> 33:31.333
that the audience is engaged in
and believes in.

33:31.400 --> 33:35.133
And a lot of times, we've seen
a lot of people come out

33:35.200 --> 33:38.300
and tell the story
and no one gives a damn.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.100
-(CHUCKLES)
-And you stood there,

33:40.167 --> 33:43.700
and the whole audience
was completely rapt in their attention.

33:44.167 --> 33:48.833
Now we do a trick in our show called
The Magic Bullet or The Bullet Catch,

33:48.900 --> 33:51.000
and it's one of the tricks
we're most proud of.

33:51.067 --> 33:55.933
And we got help for that trick
by a man by the name of Steve Shaw.

33:56.733 --> 33:58.567
And Steve Shaw also did

33:58.633 --> 34:03.467
something very close to the Genesis song
<i>Invisible Touch.</i>

34:03.867 --> 34:06.867
And your performance of it
was beautiful for us.

34:07.900 --> 34:11.400
We're so happy,
and this is an important thing to say,

34:11.467 --> 34:13.766
that you did that without a gimmick.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.533
You did that with real magic
and real thought,

34:16.600 --> 34:19.533
and there's people who do that same trick
with a gimmick.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.933
We don't like it as much.
You did a pure Steve Shaw,

34:23.000 --> 34:26.433
and you also did the slate routine
absolutely pure,

34:26.632 --> 34:28.600
just the way the spiritualists did it.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.733
And we loved the whole package,
and I think you know

34:31.833 --> 34:34.900
that once we've said Steve Shaw,
you probably didn't fool us,

34:35.000 --> 34:36.733
but, boy, did we love that routine.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.067
Well, thank you very much.

34:38.132 --> 34:43.199
-(APPLAUSE)
-ROSS: Peter, let me just double-check.

34:44.033 --> 34:49.333
The mention there of Steve Shaw and
one of your favorite prog rockers Genesis,

34:49.400 --> 34:51.900
that was enough information
for you to feel confident

34:51.967 --> 34:54.333
-they know what you're up to.
-They know what I'm up to. Yeah.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.500
