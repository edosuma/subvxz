'cause I'm Danger Woman!

01:19.792 --> 01:21.125
Ms. Cunningham!

01:21.208 --> 01:24.959
Wildcat, would you mind watching
Danger Woman for me?

01:25.041 --> 01:27.375
Her imagination's running wild again.

01:27.458 --> 01:29.583
You want me to catch her for you?

01:29.667 --> 01:34.417
Uh, no. Just keep her away from my office
for the rest of the day, OK?

01:34.500 --> 01:35.583
Sure thing.

01:35.667 --> 01:37.333
Now, be good, Molly.

01:37.333 --> 01:40.125
[Becky] I don't want you
driving Wildcat...

01:40.208 --> 01:41.709
Crazy.

01:41.792 --> 01:43.709
Hey, I know you.

01:43.792 --> 01:45.750
You're Danger Woman.

01:46.166 --> 01:47.083
Yeah.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.333
Want to see a pirate chest?

01:49.417 --> 01:50.500
Double yeah.

01:50.583 --> 01:53.250
Let's see, black olives.

01:56.458 --> 01:58.375
An elephant comb.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.542
A flying hat!

02:00.625 --> 02:02.083
No!

02:02.166 --> 02:03.750
A radio headset.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.458
Air traffic control!

02:06.542 --> 02:08.917
Am I clear for landing?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.709
Nope, you're surrounded.

02:10.792 --> 02:11.792
You're right.

02:11.875 --> 02:13.125
June day!

02:13.208 --> 02:16.041
Fires at 4 o'clock. Too late!

02:16.125 --> 02:17.333
Losing--

02:21.041 --> 02:22.500
What's that?

02:23.583 --> 02:24.500
It's called dust.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.625
No, I mean the book.

02:26.709 --> 02:29.291
<i>-"Flight of the Snow Duck."</i>
<i>-</i> Read it.

02:29.375 --> 02:33.250
"Once upon a time, a girl j-j..."

02:33.333 --> 02:34.458
"Journeyed".

02:34.542 --> 02:37.542
"Journeyed through a land of snow.

02:37.625 --> 02:41.834
And just as the black dragons
were about to grab her,

02:41.917 --> 02:45.291
the Snow Duck saved her."

02:45.375 --> 02:48.458
Does the Snow Duck always help people?

02:48.542 --> 02:49.792
Yup.

02:49.875 --> 02:53.583
[Wildcat] "The dragons chased
the Snow Duck all over.

02:53.667 --> 02:58.250
The Snow Duck dove where the dragons
couldn't pur--"

02:58.333 --> 02:59.375
"Pur..."

02:59.458 --> 03:02.208
-"Pursue".
-"Pursue them.

03:02.291 --> 03:05.375
The Snow Duck brought the girl home,

03:05.458 --> 03:07.625
where she lived happily ever after--"

03:07.709 --> 03:10.458
Wildcat, what's snow?

03:10.542 --> 03:11.625
You see this?

03:11.709 --> 03:12.542
Yeah.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.500
It's completely different.

03:18.375 --> 03:19.959
Baloo, what's snow?

03:20.041 --> 03:21.959
Oh, man, don't remind me.

03:22.041 --> 03:24.208
I got to go to Thembria this morning.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.709
They have snow at Thembria?

03:26.792 --> 03:29.250
[Baloo] That's about all they do have.

03:30.208 --> 03:32.709
I want to see snow!

03:32.792 --> 03:34.291
[Baloo] Sorry, doll face,

03:34.375 --> 03:37.083
Thembria's no place for a kid like you.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.166
Whoa!

03:39.250 --> 03:41.625
You need help with that?

03:41.709 --> 03:43.458
[Baloo groans]

03:43.542 --> 03:45.166
I want to go to Thembria.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.792
I don't know.

03:46.875 --> 03:47.959
Please?

03:48.041 --> 03:53.709
Well, your mom did say
to keep you away from her office.

03:56.417 --> 03:58.166
Ready?

04:02.500 --> 04:04.542
Whew! Almost didn't make it.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.792
Ministry of law and ordinance.
State your business.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.666
Delivering pink flamingos
from Cape Suzette.

04:17.750 --> 04:21.583
Excellent. Fill these out while we unload.

04:21.666 --> 04:22.709
What are these for?

04:22.792 --> 04:26.875
[clerk] An apology for parking too close.

04:26.959 --> 04:30.709
I made a boo boo, so shoot me.

04:32.709 --> 04:34.291
You got a pen?

04:34.375 --> 04:35.417
Snow!

04:35.500 --> 04:37.041
It's wonderful.

04:37.125 --> 04:40.834
And it's got no artificial color
or ingredients.

04:40.917 --> 04:42.375
Let's go.

04:42.458 --> 04:46.083
[both laughing]

04:49.208 --> 04:50.792
Watch.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.959
[both laughing]

04:55.041 --> 04:57.917
You can make all kinds of stuff
out of snow.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.709
Snowmen, snow angels, forts, castles,
apple pies, igloos.

05:04.333 --> 05:07.458
I might be wrong about the pies.

05:08.834 --> 05:12.083
What do you guys do
with those flamingos, anyway?

05:12.166 --> 05:15.500
[clerk] We buy them, paint them blue,

05:15.583 --> 05:19.041
and sell them for half what we pay.

05:19.125 --> 05:20.500
[Baloo] Don't you lose money?

05:20.583 --> 05:23.542
[clerk] Yes. It's a power struggle.

05:23.625 --> 05:27.333
They paint them pink
and sell them back.

05:27.417 --> 05:29.166
[Baloo] Why not leave them pink?

05:29.834 --> 05:32.792
Whoever heard of a pink flamingo?

05:33.750 --> 05:36.917
Just 'cause everything's
frozen here doesn't mean--

05:37.000 --> 05:39.625
Hey, what are you doing?

05:39.709 --> 05:41.041
[clerk] They're painting flamingos.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.375
[Baloo] That's my plane.

05:42.458 --> 05:45.291
According to this stamp, it's a bird.

05:45.375 --> 05:48.333
It's a plane!

05:48.417 --> 05:51.959
[clerk] Uh-oh,
defacement of state property.

05:52.041 --> 05:54.250
[whistles]

05:54.333 --> 05:56.875
Sgt. Grumpy, security.

05:56.959 --> 05:58.458
Now he can hear us.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.458
Do you want to come home with us
and meet my mommy, Mr. Snowman?

06:02.542 --> 06:05.041
He said "yes".

06:05.125 --> 06:06.208
Great.

06:07.709 --> 06:10.792
How come you pretend so good, Wildcat?

06:10.875 --> 06:12.458
Imagination.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.041
With a capital "E".

06:18.417 --> 06:20.375
Look at what I found here.

06:20.417 --> 06:21.375
Wow!

06:21.458 --> 06:24.083
A deep, neat metal thing.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.834
No, silly, it's a tob--tob...

06:26.917 --> 06:30.208
You get in and go vroom!

06:30.291 --> 06:31.375
Toboggan.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.542
Where?

06:32.625 --> 06:34.625
That's what it's called.

06:34.709 --> 06:36.041
Let's ride.

06:36.125 --> 06:37.667
Don't forget our friend.

06:46.125 --> 06:47.667
Start your motors.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.291
[Wildcat] Whoa!

06:53.375 --> 06:55.291
It's good riding snow.

06:55.375 --> 06:56.458
Oh!

07:00.625 --> 07:02.917
They're going slower than 35.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.083
Legit.

07:04.166 --> 07:05.542
But they were smiling.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.291
Playing in the snow.

07:08.375 --> 07:09.792
That is serious!

07:09.959 --> 07:11.166
Let's roll.

07:13.291 --> 07:15.709
<i>This is the sludge police!</i>

07:15.792 --> 07:18.166
It's the sludge police.

07:18.250 --> 07:19.917
Pull over immediately!

07:20.000 --> 07:22.250
He wants us to stop, Wildcat.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.250
We don't have brakes.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.166
<i>We said pull over.</i>

07:26.250 --> 07:28.917
Uh, we're trying, officer.

07:33.667 --> 07:38.083
Another thing about snow,
it's fun to land in.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.250
Police!

07:39.333 --> 07:40.500
You are under arrest!

07:40.583 --> 07:42.583
Playing in snow.

07:43.709 --> 07:46.125
But we're from out of town.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.583
Tell it to judge.

07:49.083 --> 07:52.625
[man] The glorious, colossal,
Thembriam people's court

07:52.709 --> 07:53.917
will come to order.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.542
The condemned are charged

07:55.625 --> 07:57.417
with wanton snowball rolling,

07:57.500 --> 07:59.125
frolicking without a license,

07:59.208 --> 08:03.709
and not complimenting
the judge on his new hairdo.

08:04.166 --> 08:06.375
How you are pleading?

08:06.458 --> 08:07.917
Like this?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.125
Please, I beg you, have mercy.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.208
We won't do it again.

08:13.291 --> 08:16.709
And defending our country
from these criminals

08:16.792 --> 08:19.542
is that lord of the flyboys,

08:19.625 --> 08:22.667
Colonel Ivanov Spigot.

08:22.750 --> 08:26.834
Gentlemen, exalted judge,

08:26.917 --> 08:29.750
distinguished colleagues,

08:29.834 --> 08:31.417
loyal listeners--

08:31.500 --> 08:33.625
Keep it short, Spigot!

08:34.457 --> 08:38.917
So, you were playing with snow
in my jurisdiction, eh?

08:39.000 --> 08:43.250
Where were you on May 21st,
eight years ago?

08:43.332 --> 08:46.000
I was at the bowling alley.

08:46.083 --> 08:49.500
Kirby bowled 300, I bowled gutter balls.

08:49.583 --> 08:52.750
Hmm. What were you doing this morning?

08:52.834 --> 08:55.083
I-- I don't remember.

08:55.166 --> 08:58.750
Perhaps this will refresh your memory.

08:58.834 --> 09:00.250
Our snowman!

09:00.333 --> 09:02.000
He's all mushy.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.583
Oh. You admit you know him?

09:04.667 --> 09:05.959
He's our snowman.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.542
We were taking him home.

09:08.625 --> 09:11.291
You admit you're stealing our snow!

09:11.375 --> 09:13.625
I object, your honor!

09:13.709 --> 09:15.458
Oh, poor snowman.

09:15.542 --> 09:17.375
Snowman, eh?

09:17.458 --> 09:19.500
Doesn't look much like man.

09:19.583 --> 09:21.333
Sure, he does!

09:21.417 --> 09:24.792
Here's his eyes, and that's his nose.

09:24.875 --> 09:27.458
Use your imagination!

09:28.792 --> 09:30.583
Imagination?

09:30.667 --> 09:33.709
That is capital offense in Thembria.

09:33.792 --> 09:38.959
I hereby sentence you each
to 1,000 years in prison!

09:47.542 --> 09:50.667
Welcome to prison camp Sunnyvale.

09:50.750 --> 09:54.417
Your barracks is equipped
with the latest conveniences.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.875
Cold and colder running water.

09:56.959 --> 09:58.208
Good reading light.

09:58.291 --> 09:59.709
And air conditioning.

10:00.375 --> 10:03.542
If you have any complaints, tell us.

10:03.625 --> 10:05.667
You'll be shot repeatedly.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.375
Have a nice day.

10:07.750 --> 10:10.083
I don't like it here, Wildcat.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.583
Hey, look on the bright side.

10:12.667 --> 10:15.917
We'll have plenty of time
to play in the snow.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.917
Like two centuries.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.208
I'm never going to see home again.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.333
Of course you are.

10:23.417 --> 10:27.500
I'll bet the Snow Duck
will rescue us any minute.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.000
That's right.

10:30.417 --> 10:34.125
Hey, careful of the threads, Jack.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.041
Baloo!

10:35.125 --> 10:36.583
Wildcat!

10:36.667 --> 10:37.709
Molly!

10:37.792 --> 10:41.417
Don't tell me-- Molly wanted to see snow.

10:41.500 --> 10:45.250
Yeah. We got 1,000 years
for making a snowman.

10:45.333 --> 10:50.125
I got 2,000 for not complimenting
the judge's hairdo.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.875
Hey, we'll be out before you.

10:52.959 --> 10:55.375
We can water your plants.

10:55.458 --> 10:59.125
Becky's going to kill me when she
finds out about this.

10:59.208 --> 11:02.375
Don't worry. Snow duck's coming.

11:02.458 --> 11:04.875
He always rescues people in trouble.

11:04.959 --> 11:07.041
Sure he will, sweetie.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.542
You just sit tight.

11:08.625 --> 11:11.750
Baloo's going to get us out of here.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.208
Aah!

11:21.792 --> 11:23.208
Aah!

11:23.792 --> 11:26.041
Aw, Baloo got hurted.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.834
You should rest.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.709
The Snow Duck will be here any minute.

11:30.792 --> 11:35.083
Don't mind me if I keep trying.

11:35.166 --> 11:36.625
OK.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.500
Alley oop!

11:51.917 --> 11:54.166
Yiii!

11:58.625 --> 12:00.792
Aah!

12:03.208 --> 12:05.875
So glad you could come, madame.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.542
Try the clam chowder.

12:07.625 --> 12:10.500
it's <i>tres </i> excellent and tastes good, too.

12:10.583 --> 12:13.667
Thank you, Charles. You're so kind.

12:15.417 --> 12:16.500
[slurp]

12:16.583 --> 12:18.500
Delicious, Charles.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.083
How do you do it?

12:21.959 --> 12:23.125
[slurp]

12:24.500 --> 12:26.875
This is worse than Louie's

12:26.959 --> 12:29.333
all-you-can-stand $1.00 special.

12:29.417 --> 12:32.792
It tastes good
if you use your imagination.

12:32.875 --> 12:35.000
How's the escape coming?

12:35.083 --> 12:39.333
It's so simple, even a fool could get it.

12:39.417 --> 12:42.041
We'll dig our way out.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.750
Wow! I get it!

12:44.834 --> 12:47.083
We'll be out before you--

12:47.166 --> 12:49.333
But the Snow Duck's coming.

12:49.417 --> 12:51.208
Yeah, that.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.667
OK, Wildcat, once I start digging,

12:57.792 --> 12:59.250
you hide the snow.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.208
Molly, you'll be the lookout.

13:01.291 --> 13:04.208
But you don't have to dig, Baloo.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.583
The Snow Duck is coming.

13:06.667 --> 13:07.667
Ow!

13:09.792 --> 13:12.208
The Snow Duck is not coming.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.333
There's no such thing!

13:21.750 --> 13:24.083
Aw, I'm sorry, sweetie.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.959
That wasn't very nice, Baloo.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.458
Yeah, I know.

13:30.542 --> 13:33.792
Wildcat, tell her I didn't mean it, OK?

13:33.875 --> 13:36.250
Well...OK.

13:41.917 --> 13:43.792
Want to play in the snow?

13:43.875 --> 13:44.875
No.

13:46.667 --> 13:48.291
Want a doughnut?

13:49.041 --> 13:52.333
It's not a doughnut. It's just snow.

13:52.417 --> 13:54.500
Use your imagination.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.250
No, Baloo's right. There is no Snow Duck.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.291
Pretending is silly.

14:00.375 --> 14:06.041
Maybe I'm not as smart
as your mom or Baloo,

14:06.125 --> 14:10.083
but I do know you've got to have
imagination.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.417
Why?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.792
You'll never make anything here

14:13.875 --> 14:16.792
if you don't see it here first.

14:16.875 --> 14:21.083
<i>Hi. Snow duck here.</i>
<i>somebody need rescuing?</i>

14:21.458 --> 14:24.375
Wildcat, that's it.

14:24.458 --> 14:25.875
Well, of course.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.083
What's it?

14:27.166 --> 14:29.041
The Snow Duck.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.917
But it has to be way bigger.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.291
How big?

14:33.375 --> 14:36.291
Big enough to fly us out.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.333
Could you talk slower?

14:38.417 --> 14:41.625
The Snow Duck's coming!
The Snow Duck's coming!

14:41.709 --> 14:43.834
Mr. Guard man,

14:43.917 --> 14:46.083
Can I have some water?

14:46.166 --> 14:48.709
There's a water shortage.

14:48.792 --> 14:50.709
It keeps turning to ice.

14:50.792 --> 14:52.125
Please?

14:52.250 --> 14:55.709
I'm so thirsty.

14:55.792 --> 14:58.625
Oh... OK.

15:00.709 --> 15:03.041
Thank you, Mr. Guard man.

15:04.458 --> 15:07.375
[Wildcat whistling]

15:10.917 --> 15:12.583
Hey, Baloo.

15:12.667 --> 15:13.500
What?

15:13.583 --> 15:16.083
Me and Molly are working on something.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.583
Good. I'm glad the kid
got it's spirit back.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.417
Everything's under control down here.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.667
[Wildcat whistling]

15:40.959 --> 15:43.041
Hey, Baloo!

15:45.125 --> 15:48.500
Ba-loo-oo-oo!

15:58.667 --> 16:00.417
Everything's under control.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.041
Just a few more miles

16:02.125 --> 16:03.709
and we're out.

16:03.792 --> 16:06.166
There's something
Molly wants to show you first.

16:09.917 --> 16:11.166
What the...

16:12.750 --> 16:14.542
[Wildcat] Can you fly it?

16:15.542 --> 16:17.709
I don't even know what it is.

16:17.792 --> 16:20.959
It's an airplane, a really cool one.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.291
It's not just any plane.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.166
It's the Snow Duck.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.500
It will rescue us.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.667
How did you think of this?

16:30.750 --> 16:32.250
Imagination.

16:34.166 --> 16:36.959
You are a piece of work.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.750
And cute to boot.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.834
[Baloo] Well, pile in.

16:42.917 --> 16:44.834
This ain't no hayride.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.125
Ow.

16:53.667 --> 16:56.000
Oh, no! I forgot something.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.250
Molly!

16:57.333 --> 16:58.792
[guard] Halt.

17:00.834 --> 17:03.959
So much for the Snow Duck's rescue.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.875
Let's grab Molly and scoot.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.290
Freeze.

17:17.875 --> 17:20.333
Oh, Mr. Guard man.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.040
Solid gold!

17:25.125 --> 17:28.333
Pretty fancy shooting, Danger Woman.

17:28.416 --> 17:30.333
Molly, where'd you go?

17:30.417 --> 17:33.500
I forgot Wildcat's flying hat.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.709
Let's get out of here.

17:40.375 --> 17:41.625
[whistle blows]

17:41.709 --> 17:43.208
<i>The prisoners are escaping!</i>

17:45.959 --> 17:49.083
She glides nice, but will she fly?

17:49.166 --> 17:51.542
[Baloo] Uh-oh. End of the line.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.625
Come on, Snow Duck, save us.

17:56.417 --> 17:59.875
<i>The prisoners have escaped. Send fighters.</i>

18:01.208 --> 18:03.709
This baby really does fly.

18:03.792 --> 18:06.125
Wildcat, you're a genius.

18:06.208 --> 18:08.458
It was Molly's idea.

18:08.542 --> 18:11.667
Cupcake, you'll have to give me

18:11.750 --> 18:14.166
some of them imagination lessons.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.166
Yeah.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.125
[Baloo] Now let's find the Sea Duck

18:17.208 --> 18:18.792
and get out.

18:20.875 --> 18:23.667
Oh, great. They're hauling my baby
back to Cape Suzette.

18:23.750 --> 18:24.750
Last call.

18:24.834 --> 18:27.667
All flamingos aboard for Cape Suzette.

18:27.750 --> 18:31.041
That's the second biggest flamingo
I have ever seen.

18:32.709 --> 18:34.709
What else can go wrong?

18:37.625 --> 18:39.709
Yikes! Evasive action!

18:46.083 --> 18:47.834
Hey, where'd they go?

18:47.917 --> 18:50.166
[Molly] They can't see us.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.792
So long, you horseflies.

18:55.291 --> 18:56.875
They <i>can </i> see us.

18:56.959 --> 18:58.834
What about another disguise?

18:58.917 --> 19:01.500
[Baloo] Aw, not the wing.

19:01.583 --> 19:02.709
I'll fix it.

19:02.792 --> 19:05.625
Wildcat, are you nuts?

19:05.709 --> 19:08.041
[Baloo] That was a stupid question.

19:09.750 --> 19:10.792
[Baloo] Whoo-eee!

19:10.875 --> 19:12.625
[Molly] My hero!

19:12.709 --> 19:16.041
Look. I got a bucket of wing.

19:16.125 --> 19:17.375
Wildcat!

19:18.458 --> 19:20.625
I'm having an ice time.

19:20.709 --> 19:22.375
[Baloo] Hang on!

19:25.500 --> 19:28.041
Sit down. You're making me nervous.

19:31.959 --> 19:33.208
In the storybook,

19:33.291 --> 19:36.834
the Snow Duck lost the dragons
with a trick.

19:36.917 --> 19:38.917
How?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.291
He zips down a rabbit hole.

19:41.375 --> 19:44.208
But where's one big enough?

19:44.291 --> 19:45.542
There.

19:45.625 --> 19:48.875
[Baloo] Ok. Hang on to your icicles.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.375
[Baloo] Did we make it?

19:53.458 --> 19:55.417
[Molly] Just like the book.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.583
[Wildcat] Too dark to read.

19:57.667 --> 19:58.875
[Baloo] Hot diggity!

19:58.959 --> 20:00.959
If this is the pipeline,

20:01.041 --> 20:04.083
we're going straight through.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.667
You're a genius, Molly.

20:07.667 --> 20:10.125
So is Wildcat.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.417
Oh...

20:12.500 --> 20:14.583
So there was a detour.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.458
We're in the clear.

20:16.542 --> 20:18.125
Incoming!

20:18.208 --> 20:19.792
Yow!

20:20.917 --> 20:22.750
[Baloo] They're dropping tubs.

20:22.834 --> 20:24.834
[Baloo] It'll take real imagination

20:24.917 --> 20:26.667
to get out of this.

20:26.750 --> 20:27.750
In the storybook,

20:27.834 --> 20:30.834
the Snow Duck made the dragons go bye-bye.

20:30.917 --> 20:34.208
How? How did make them go nye-bye?

20:34.291 --> 20:36.709
He let out a mighty quack.

20:36.792 --> 20:39.375
We're already sitting ducks.

20:39.458 --> 20:41.959
I don't think quacking will help.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.458
Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!

20:45.542 --> 20:46.709
Quack! quack!

20:46.792 --> 20:51.041
Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!

20:54.709 --> 20:56.542
You're a genius, Molly.

20:56.625 --> 20:58.125
I know.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.375
Whoo-eee! Goodbye, Thembria.

21:05.458 --> 21:08.041
Just feel that sunshine.

21:08.125 --> 21:09.375
Uh-oh.

21:09.458 --> 21:12.625
Baloo, I think we sprung a leak.

21:14.166 --> 21:16.667
[Baloo] That's no leak. We're melting.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.166
Don't panic.

21:18.250 --> 21:21.834
We're fine, as long as the engine holds.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.625
[Baloo] Oh, man.

21:25.667 --> 21:28.041
[all screaming]

21:28.834 --> 21:30.333
That wasn't so far.

21:30.417 --> 21:32.083
We're on something.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.417
[Baloo] Oh, yeah!

21:45.458 --> 21:47.542
[yawn]

21:47.625 --> 21:49.208
Done at last.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.417
Better get Molly and go to dinner.

21:59.375 --> 22:00.792
Blue?

22:00.875 --> 22:01.875
Blue?

22:01.959 --> 22:04.250
Yes, my plane-- all blue,

22:04.333 --> 22:06.458
with a 50-cent price tag

22:06.542 --> 22:08.709
and a snowman in the front seat.

22:08.792 --> 22:09.875
Mother, please.

22:09.959 --> 22:12.959
Don't let your imagination run wild.
