03:34.180 --> 03:35.670
You want some?

05:12.512 --> 05:14.503
- How'd we do?
- $27.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.176
Nobody questions shrink wrap.

05:20.386 --> 05:24.015
- Are you hungry?
- A little bit. The dog probably is a lot.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.082
Good job.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.423
Can you stop touching my hair?

05:28.995 --> 05:30.690
Hey, his collar slipped off.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.788
And you waited right here.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.029
What a good boy. Yes, you are!

05:36.102 --> 05:38.297
Oh, we missed you too, buddy.

05:39.372 --> 05:42.136
I hope he knows what we go through
just to feed him.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.506
All right, here you go, Friday.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.810
I've never seen a dog
eat that much. Ever.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.251
Here you go.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.654
Nice catch.

05:58.124 --> 05:59.148
Go.

05:59.592 --> 06:00.616
Go.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.322
Meet us at home, Friday.

06:04.397 --> 06:05.557
Excuse me, miss.

06:05.631 --> 06:08.429
That's her.
She's the one who ripped me off.

06:08.501 --> 06:10.332
Thank goodness you're here, Officer.

06:10.403 --> 06:13.895
This guy's been stalking me all day,
and it's really freaking me out.

06:34.293 --> 06:36.261
Okay, thanks. I really appreciate it.

06:36.329 --> 06:39.321
Either I call you or
I have to fill out all the forms.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.731
- Love to Alice.
- Yeah. Same to Carol.

06:41.801 --> 06:44.099
Central City PD, precinct desk.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.729
Hold on, I'll transfer you.

06:46.806 --> 06:50.298
Put it down.

06:50.376 --> 06:52.037
- Hey.
- Hey, Bernie.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.740
Don't "Hey, Bernie" me.

06:55.815 --> 06:59.012
You know I have half a mind
to leave you two here?

07:00.286 --> 07:02.686
You're sprung. Come on, let's go.

07:05.525 --> 07:06.787
Hurry up.

07:07.794 --> 07:11.355
I'll do the rest of my yelling
while I'm taking you back.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.737
Look, the guy
could have pressed charges.

07:18.805 --> 07:21.603
You sold him a rock in a box
for 20 bucks.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.169
Oh, that's funny?

07:26.145 --> 07:28.841
It's not funny. It's anything but funny.

07:28.915 --> 07:32.043
What if they'd called Carl and Lois
instead of me?

07:33.886 --> 07:37.982
I guess you'd have to find us
new foster parents, then.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.060
Is that what you're trying to do?

07:43.763 --> 07:47.290
You guys, that's
a very dangerous game, I'm telling you.

07:48.534 --> 07:49.523
One and...

07:54.474 --> 07:55.498
No.

07:56.809 --> 08:00.404
You know, the word "harmonizing"
comes from the word "harmony."

08:00.480 --> 08:03.643
- So?
- So I'm saying you're still half a step off.

08:03.716 --> 08:06.810
Oh, really? Well, that's funny
because my vocal instructor,

08:06.886 --> 08:10.947
who is a paid vocal instructor,
didn't notice that, but you did.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.650
Here's the note.

08:21.868 --> 08:24.029
You're late.
And you interrupted rehearsal.

08:24.103 --> 08:25.661
I'm very sorry.

08:26.038 --> 08:27.938
Get in there. Hurry up.

08:29.108 --> 08:32.270
Babe, maybe we should skip this one
and just play the hit.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.178
- They're all hits, baby.
- You're right.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.078
- Hey, Bernie.
- Carl.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.174
Your food's on your trays.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.579
Yummy! It's too bad we already ate.

08:44.657 --> 08:47.182
Fine. It'll be lunch tomorrow.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.559
All right, could we just get back
to the issue at hand, okay?

08:50.630 --> 08:52.530
I'm a kind woman. Okay?

08:53.232 --> 08:57.134
In fact, everyone's always asking,
"Lois, why are you so kind?"

08:58.304 --> 08:59.965
But we have rules. Okay?

09:00.039 --> 09:04.476
We serve dinner at a certain time, so
we can finish dinner at a certain time.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.537
So we can drop our rock manifesto
on the world at a certain time.

09:12.151 --> 09:15.746
Okay, but those times have come
and gone. So...

09:15.821 --> 09:17.254
<i>Oh, where were they?</i>

09:21.394 --> 09:24.192
Look, this whole thing is my fault. Okay?

09:25.097 --> 09:29.431
We were just getting caught up
and we were having so much fun...

09:29.502 --> 09:30.867
Whoa. Yeah.

09:30.937 --> 09:34.771
...that I just lost track of time.
I'm sorry, really. My apologies.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.865
Now, why don't we just
get them to their room

09:36.943 --> 09:42.074
and you guys can continue
making that magic.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.590
- Thanks for covering for us.
- Andi, Andi. Listen!

09:54.660 --> 09:57.026
You cannot afford to screw this up.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.587
You've only been here
two months, okay?

09:59.665 --> 10:02.463
This is your fifth set
of foster parents in three years.

10:02.535 --> 10:06.027
The Johnsons don't count,
we were there for two hours.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.265
Do you know the reaction I get
when I tell people

10:09.342 --> 10:11.742
I'm trying to place
11 and 16-year-old siblings?

10:11.811 --> 10:15.440
It ain't a good one. Okay?
You guys mess this up, that's it.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.106
I don't have any more favors
I can call in.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.310
I'm gonna have to
place you two separately.

10:19.385 --> 10:22.912
No! You know I won't
let that happen, Bernie.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.456
We stay together.

10:24.523 --> 10:26.684
All right, then
take a little advice from me, okay?

10:26.759 --> 10:30.126
A technique that I've learned.
When somebody who I...

10:31.197 --> 10:34.758
...who I don't particularly like is saying
something that I don't want to hear,

10:34.834 --> 10:37.997
I just nod and I go, "Mmm-hmm."
It works wonders.

10:38.671 --> 10:39.899
Mmm-hmm.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.209
Okay, I'm through with you guys.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.010
I'll tell you what, I better not get
any more phone calls

10:52.084 --> 10:55.281
about a trick with a brick
or a scam with a ham...

11:04.930 --> 11:09.162
Okay, it was a good talk, Bernie.
Thank you very much for stopping by.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.032
What are you guys...

11:27.787 --> 11:30.415
Good boy. Somebody's tired today, huh?

11:31.023 --> 11:32.149
I am.

12:25.377 --> 12:26.571
Friday.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.975
- Andi.
- Yeah.

12:30.049 --> 12:31.846
- Friday's gone.
- What?

12:34.587 --> 12:37.021
- Friday, come here.
- Where'd he go?

12:41.627 --> 12:42.889
Good God.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.920
You two are just a bundle of energy.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.800
Good morning!

12:49.568 --> 12:51.058
Stop shouting.

12:52.037 --> 12:56.235
My vocal instructor said getting
frightened is bad for my pitch.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.105
What are you doing up so early?

12:58.177 --> 13:00.975
- Just thought we'd get some...
- Breakfast!

13:02.448 --> 13:05.611
All right, so, I unlocked the pantry.

13:05.684 --> 13:08.448
Your cereal's in there.
You know how to get it.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.716
I'm not your servant. All right?

13:10.790 --> 13:14.783
I am obliged to prepare two meals
a day, that's lunch and dinner.

13:16.195 --> 13:17.389
Friday!

13:17.930 --> 13:19.022
What?

13:19.431 --> 13:22.889
I said,
"Bruce, what is the day after Thursday?"

13:22.968 --> 13:24.560
- Friday!
- Thanks.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.935
Fine. Get weird on me.
I can handle weird.

13:35.447 --> 13:39.679
Okay, I don't need your attitude
about setting the table, okay?

13:39.752 --> 13:41.242
Don't be lazy.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.085
It needs cinnamon.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.992
Or is it cinnamon that Carl's allergic to?

13:50.729 --> 13:53.163
Well, one way to find out, I guess.

13:53.232 --> 13:56.429
Let's see him harmonize
with a tongue the size of a beehive.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.403
Wait! You just reminded me
of this really funny story.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.564
I was walking and I stepped on a bee
and it stung me.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.904
So then, I went and took care of my foot,

14:03.976 --> 14:08.174
then I went back for the bee
to throw it outside and I thought,

14:08.247 --> 14:11.341
"You know, I'd be safe because
bees can't sting you more than once."

14:11.417 --> 14:15.217
Right? I mean, right? It was crazy.
I mean, isn't that crazy?

14:16.989 --> 14:18.183
Excuse me.

14:18.257 --> 14:21.658
You owe me 30 seconds of my life,
and I will collect.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.200
Thanks for the heart attack.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.864
Of course I checked in there,
maybe they're in the kids' room.

14:33.939 --> 14:36.339
Carl, did you eat the bacon?

14:36.408 --> 14:38.171
Stay close, Friday.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.879
Did I leave my whitening strips in here?

16:06.298 --> 16:09.165
He'd usually be here by now.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.361
You know, maybe he can't hear it.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.905
It's mealtime.
He could hear it on the moon.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.533
He's probably just wandering around.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.308
Friday! Friday!

16:26.185 --> 16:29.621
- What are we gonna do?
- Come on. Friday!

16:32.458 --> 16:35.450
Friday! Come on!
Maybe he ran down this alley.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.152
Friday!

16:41.533 --> 16:44.297
You don't think he went in there,
do you?

16:48.374 --> 16:52.640
No. Why would he go in there?
He's probably just out looking for food.

16:53.846 --> 16:54.938
Friday!

16:56.115 --> 16:58.413
How cute. I want one.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.428
Nice haircut.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.866
Thanks, Dave.
I was hoping you'd notice.

17:14.933 --> 17:17.834
Oh, I was actually
talking about the Pomeranian.

17:17.903 --> 17:20.666
But yours is, yours is really nice, too.

17:20.739 --> 17:23.469
- You did something new to it.
- I did.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.806
And I'm pretty sure you could tell
when I first got it done

17:25.877 --> 17:28.210
because you kind of looked at me
and then looked away,

17:28.280 --> 17:30.510
and then looked back like,
"Hey, something's different."

17:30.582 --> 17:32.982
But then you didn't say anything
and I was like, "Men."

17:33.052 --> 17:35.247
So then the next day I tried
to compliment you on your hair,

17:35.320 --> 17:36.981
you know,
giving you a little hint here but...

17:37.056 --> 17:40.617
No, absolutely. I totally remember that.
Anyways, it looks great.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.224
Can I help you?

17:54.006 --> 17:56.702
No, no, we're just looking for our dog.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.040
I don't suppose you've seen him,
have you?

18:00.612 --> 18:02.079
No.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.274
Friday? That's a funny name.

18:05.284 --> 18:09.084
I bet when you find him, you'll say,
"Thank God it's Friday."

18:10.722 --> 18:14.021
Right? It's a joke. So...

18:15.127 --> 18:17.618
I don't think
I've ever seen you around here before.

18:17.696 --> 18:21.860
- Do you go to Thomas Jefferson?
- I will actually, in the fall. Andi.

18:22.134 --> 18:23.226
Dave.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.793
My family just moved here
a couple of months ago.

18:25.871 --> 18:28.567
That's cool. How do you like it so far?

18:29.041 --> 18:30.770
What's not to like?

18:34.746 --> 18:36.839
- We have to go.
- No problem.

18:37.916 --> 18:42.319
You know, if he doesn't show up soon,
you might want to check the pound.

19:16.388 --> 19:18.549
- Friday! Friday! There he is!
- There he is.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.251
- There he is.
- There he is! Friday! Friday!

19:20.325 --> 19:22.657
- Your dog?
- Yeah, that's our dog!

19:35.974 --> 19:37.771
Yeah, he just got in.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.707
Yeah, I know, we just saw him.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.677
Well, I'm always glad
when these things have a happy ending.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.310
We're open till 6:00. Get your parents,
come back, we'll figure it out.

19:47.386 --> 19:48.876
Wait! Wait...

19:48.954 --> 19:52.082
Come on, we're already here.
It's our dog.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.889
Yeah, well, there's a lot of paperwork.
Grown-up paperwork.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.822
There's always a guy
who screws up the paperwork.

19:59.898 --> 20:02.594
But you see this guy? I'm not that guy.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.936
We can't let him out alone anymore.

20:41.006 --> 20:44.100
I mean, if he gets picked up again,
we might not get him back.

20:44.176 --> 20:47.907
And things are gonna get
so much harder when school starts.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.338
Look, Bruce, I think we need
to find Friday a new home.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.516
- Well, you know, I've got a few ideas.
- No.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.782
We've been hiding him
in alleys and garages,

20:57.856 --> 21:00.381
in the woods for three years.

21:02.127 --> 21:06.359
Don't you think he deserves
a real home with a real family?

21:07.799 --> 21:09.824
But we are a real family.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.310
Let's get out of here.

21:26.551 --> 21:30.043
- <i>You kids! Hold it right there!</i>
- We can't get in trouble again.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.990
- But we didn't do anything wrong.
- You want to tell them that?

21:49.141 --> 21:50.540
Oh, my God.

22:03.555 --> 22:05.989
- Friday! No! Get back here!
- Bruce!

22:08.126 --> 22:09.388
Come on.

22:26.144 --> 22:28.044
- You got anything?
- No.

22:30.148 --> 22:31.513
Forget it.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.188
Let's just find Friday
and get out of here.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.088
Friday!

22:47.899 --> 22:49.628
Circuits are fried.

22:50.469 --> 22:51.663
Friday!

22:56.908 --> 22:58.603
Bruce, stay close.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.213
Wow. Andi, look at all this stuff.

23:15.927 --> 23:17.155
Careful.

23:18.597 --> 23:19.791
Friday?

23:30.308 --> 23:33.368
Friday, where are you, boy?

23:39.284 --> 23:41.878
- What's that?
- It's just an old hotel.

23:44.055 --> 23:45.488
Hotels don't make footsteps.

23:45.557 --> 23:49.789
People make footsteps when they walk
through hotels with their feet.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.196
Good point. Come on!

23:59.938 --> 24:01.337
Go, go, go!

24:31.169 --> 24:32.830
Friday, stay back.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.147
Do you think they belong to anyone?

24:54.626 --> 24:56.389
If they did, would they be here?

24:56.461 --> 24:58.656
Better here than the pound.

24:58.730 --> 25:00.197
Friday! Wait!

25:20.051 --> 25:22.747
- Look at that.
- Okay.

25:37.369 --> 25:41.100
What about just, you know,
leaving Friday with them tonight?

25:49.180 --> 25:50.511
One night.

25:58.957 --> 26:02.085
Good night, guys. Sleep tight.

26:28.253 --> 26:31.245
So I mean it's supposed to be
a teacher appreciation lunch, right?

26:31.323 --> 26:33.257
But then it ends up
being more work for us

26:33.325 --> 26:35.384
if we have to set it up
and then clean it up.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.518
I mean, sometimes, you know,

26:36.595 --> 26:40.156
I could appreciate
a little less appreciation, you know?

26:40.231 --> 26:43.962
Don't nod and "Mmm-hmm" me.
I taught you the nod and "Mmm-hmm."

26:44.035 --> 26:46.663
Yeah, that's true,
but I'd like to think I've made it my own.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.103
Oh, really?

26:51.876 --> 26:55.039
- What's wrong?
- It's these kids, the other night.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.480
- Andi and Bruce?
- Yeah.

26:58.550 --> 27:01.041
- Are they okay?
- I don't know.

27:01.119 --> 27:04.213
I mean, it's bad enough
they lost their parents.

27:04.689 --> 27:06.281
If they can't work this situation out,

27:06.358 --> 27:08.019
I don't know if we're gonna be able
to find a family

27:08.093 --> 27:10.391
that's gonna take the both of them.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.487
You do everything you can for them,
you know.

27:12.564 --> 27:16.125
You can't bring home
your work and let it make you crazy.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.065
- You're right.
- Yeah.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.462
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

27:23.008 --> 27:25.977
It's too bad.
You know, they really are good kids.

27:33.118 --> 27:36.212
It's three hungry dogs.
Grab as much as you can.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.026
That's quite a load there.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.637
Yeah. Just getting some breakfast.

27:55.707 --> 27:58.642
What, are you feeding
the whole neighborhood?

28:01.312 --> 28:04.645
Okay, you wouldn't even touch this
the first time.

28:04.716 --> 28:07.583
I don't eat, you're angry.
I eat, you're angry.

28:07.652 --> 28:11.452
Okay, fine, people, eat.
Lucky for you I saved your dinners.

28:12.490 --> 28:14.481
You can start with those.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.798
Come on.

28:40.785 --> 28:42.252
What is that?

28:46.124 --> 28:48.957
You know, if you would eat
the meals I make,

28:49.027 --> 28:50.995
you wouldn't be so hungry
in the morning.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.690
You're right. Thank you so much, Lois.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.472
Done.

29:18.156 --> 29:19.316
I'm hearing something.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.006
What?

29:51.823 --> 29:55.281
- What's his problem?
- I don't know. Why are you asking me?

29:55.360 --> 29:57.157
Stop howling, please.

30:19.951 --> 30:22.419
Yes, I'd like to call in a complaint
about a howling dog.

30:29.527 --> 30:30.687
That's it?

30:30.762 --> 30:33.731
All that just so
you could look out a window?

30:37.335 --> 30:38.700
Never mind.

31:01.559 --> 31:04.426
Wow. Even Lenny
and Georgia won't touch it.

31:06.631 --> 31:08.656
We need to go get
some real dog food for them.

31:08.733 --> 31:10.564
Wait, who?

31:10.635 --> 31:13.331
Lenny and Georgia.
That's what I named the new dogs.

31:13.404 --> 31:14.666
No. No naming them.

31:14.739 --> 31:16.172
If you name them,
you're gonna get attached.

31:16.241 --> 31:20.143
Andi, look at her.
Tell me she's not a Georgia.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.337
Bruce, I'm not kidding, okay?

31:21.412 --> 31:24.472
I'm glad
that Friday's getting along well with

31:24.549 --> 31:29.145
dog number one and dog number two,
but we're barely keeping our dog safe.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.848
I mean, do you know what happens
if we get caught in here?

31:31.923 --> 31:34.414
Trespassing, breaking and entering.

31:34.492 --> 31:38.394
You heard what Bernie said.
They'd split us up and ship us off.

31:38.796 --> 31:40.696
Are you even listening?

32:02.053 --> 32:04.078
So I'll stay here and keep them quiet

32:04.155 --> 32:07.955
while you go out
and get some real food. Okay?

32:09.394 --> 32:13.455
Okay, fine. But just for now.
And I'll be back.

32:14.599 --> 32:19.229
Stay, Friday. Stay, Georgia.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.433
You better keep them quiet.

33:07.685 --> 33:09.016
You like to fetch.

33:17.795 --> 33:22.926
- Hey. I see you found your dog.
- Yeah. He's fine.

33:23.601 --> 33:25.091
That's great.

33:25.970 --> 33:29.872
- Can I help you find anything?
- No, just getting some dog food.

33:30.274 --> 33:34.506
- That's 40 pounds, by the way.
- Yeah, that's probably right.

33:35.146 --> 33:37.808
For that little dog on the flier,
40 pounds?

33:37.882 --> 33:40.476
Well, the thing is, I actually...
I have three dogs,

33:40.551 --> 33:42.246
two of them are strays.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.585
- My parents, they just love animals.
- That's great.

33:46.824 --> 33:49.759
Yeah. You know, they're the best.
I'm really lucky.

33:49.827 --> 33:54.093
We have this big yard
and we just rescue dogs all the time.

33:55.833 --> 33:59.166
- All the time?
- Well, yeah, whenever.

34:01.839 --> 34:04.273
You know what? Here, come with me.

34:10.348 --> 34:12.282
- They're so cute.
- Yeah.

34:15.186 --> 34:16.516
We adopt out dogs here,

34:16.587 --> 34:19.487
but we can't get anybody
to take these guys.

34:20.224 --> 34:23.819
They're not puppies anymore,
and everybody always wants puppies.

34:23.895 --> 34:24.953
Tell me about it.

34:25.029 --> 34:28.293
They're also kind of...
Well, they're loveably defective.

34:28.366 --> 34:31.858
Cooper, he's my favorite.
I think he's actually half goat.

34:31.936 --> 34:33.927
There's not a substance on Earth
he can't chew through.

34:34.005 --> 34:38.567
He's been through pocketbooks,
cell phones, shoes, handbags,

34:38.643 --> 34:41.271
even ate through a license plate once.

34:42.346 --> 34:43.835
This is Shep.

34:45.683 --> 34:48.379
Yeah, she's got some herding issues.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.353
- Pushy.
- I like pushy.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.987
So, they've got quirks.
I mean, they're still adorable.

34:58.062 --> 35:01.589
Good, I'm glad you think so,
because you're taking them.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.395
What? No.

35:08.005 --> 35:09.836
The owner says
we can't keep them forever

35:09.907 --> 35:14.139
and if I can't find a place to put them,
then they're going to the pound.

35:14.212 --> 35:16.043
Look, I'm sorry,
but there's no way that I can just...

35:16.114 --> 35:19.777
You're already taking care
of a few strays, what's three more?

35:19.851 --> 35:22.877
- Three?
- Oh, yeah. You're gonna love this guy.

35:23.688 --> 35:26.213
Romeo. Romeo. Romeo.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.021
Whoa.

35:33.030 --> 35:34.895
What if you just took them
for a little while?

35:34.966 --> 35:38.026
Until I can figure something out.
I'll pay for food.

35:38.102 --> 35:41.435
I get an employee discount.
It's the least I can do.

35:53.584 --> 35:57.953
Georgia, I'm sorry, but I can't stand here
all day playing fetch with you.

35:58.022 --> 35:59.614
Georgia, zip it.

36:01.659 --> 36:02.717
No.

36:06.931 --> 36:09.456
Guys, come on! Please! Oh, no!

36:10.067 --> 36:13.264
What's it gonna take for me
to get you guys to...

36:24.916 --> 36:26.474
Sweet ride.

36:26.551 --> 36:30.544
Yeah, it's pretty much a chick magnet.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

36:32.056 --> 36:36.015
Getting close. Right there. That's it.

36:38.729 --> 36:40.162
This is where you live?

36:40.231 --> 36:43.200
Actually, my parents are out of town,

36:43.267 --> 36:46.202
so I kind of had to make
other arrangements.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.136
This place looks condemned.
What are we doing here?

36:54.212 --> 36:56.305
It's where we keep the dogs.

36:56.380 --> 37:00.407
- Well, are you allowed to be in there?
- No, so let's move it.

37:06.257 --> 37:08.384
All right, guys, watch this.

37:09.660 --> 37:10.854
Ready?

37:15.466 --> 37:18.026
Are you sure it's safe in here?

37:18.102 --> 37:22.266
Yeah. We've been poking around here
for a couple of days, actually.

37:26.944 --> 37:29.208
Okay, that hurt.

37:41.859 --> 37:43.258
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

37:43.327 --> 37:49.061
Bruce, you remember Dave, right?
Dave from the pet store.

37:50.968 --> 37:52.799
Hi, Dave.

37:53.204 --> 37:56.173
He just needed a place
to keep a couple of dogs

37:56.240 --> 37:59.334
and I thought, you know,
"Hey, we have a place."

38:00.311 --> 38:01.972
So you made this?

38:02.647 --> 38:04.911
Yeah. It's a work in progress.

38:07.385 --> 38:10.013
And how did you learn
how to make that?

38:10.721 --> 38:11.949
My dad.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.385
Wouldn't it be easier
just to throw it, though?

38:16.460 --> 38:19.588
Yeah, but that's not really the point.
The point is when I get it working,

38:19.664 --> 38:23.122
she should be able to play fetch
even when we're not here.

38:25.736 --> 38:28.170
Can you give me free pay-per-view?

38:29.573 --> 38:31.165
Oh, poop!

38:34.745 --> 38:36.178
Literally!

38:36.781 --> 38:40.239
What is going on here?
I mean, who poops on the floor?

38:42.620 --> 38:45.851
- Sorry. I need to work on that.
- How did you find us?

38:45.923 --> 38:48.915
I followed the van
with the ears and the tail.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.622
You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?

38:54.932 --> 38:57.730
Why would I tell?
I'm gonna help you guys.

38:58.703 --> 38:59.897
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:59.970 --> 39:02.461
I love dogs, and there's a lot more
to taking care of them

39:02.540 --> 39:05.236
than throwing a stick and feeding them.

39:05.309 --> 39:06.936
You guys need me.

39:14.318 --> 39:15.876
I say she's in.

39:16.654 --> 39:19.384
Okay. I mean,
how much trouble can they be?

39:31.135 --> 39:32.659
Come on, guys.

39:37.174 --> 39:40.610
Do you really think we can do this,
like, every day?

39:40.678 --> 39:43.408
Yeah, why not? This is a piece of cake.

39:56.160 --> 39:59.425
- Guys, come back! Come back!
- Guys, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

39:59.497 --> 40:01.397
Treat! Who wants a treat?

40:01.465 --> 40:03.262
Friday, no! Where is Romeo?

40:03.334 --> 40:06.132
Okay, Heather, you go that way,
I'll go this way.

40:07.471 --> 40:09.496
Aren't we supposed
to be wearing them out?

40:09.573 --> 40:11.473
This is totally normal.

40:16.180 --> 40:19.707
- Oh, so you think this is funny?
- No, no, not at all.

40:19.784 --> 40:24.380
Actually, I was just about to thank you
for reminding me to watch where I...

40:25.689 --> 40:26.747
...step.

40:46.710 --> 40:49.406
You know, I think we might
be in a little over our heads.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.778
It's 4-6, we're outdogged.

40:58.155 --> 41:00.214
Guys, it's really not that bad.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.727
I mean, if you look at it,
dogs have three basic needs.

41:03.794 --> 41:07.525
That's eating, sleeping
and then peeing and pooping.

41:07.598 --> 41:11.500
- That's four.
- No, I think peeing and pooping's one.

41:11.569 --> 41:14.834
I've stepped in both,
and I'd have to disagree.

41:17.675 --> 41:21.441
Look, guys, I'm serious.
I really think I can make this work.

41:21.912 --> 41:23.004
How?

42:07.391 --> 42:09.052
What do you think?

42:22.540 --> 42:23.768
Thanks.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.994
No, no, no, no. No.

43:03.314 --> 43:04.508
Ready?

44:30.367 --> 44:31.698
That's disgusting.

44:31.769 --> 44:34.932
That has to be the grossest thing
I've ever seen.

44:35.372 --> 44:36.896
That's awesome.

44:40.144 --> 44:44.240
We just wandered in here.
I'm not really sure what that thing was.

44:49.586 --> 44:52.282
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

44:52.623 --> 44:55.820
In fact, if you let me,
I'd love to help you guys.

44:56.360 --> 45:00.194
I just work down the street, you know,
I could keep an eye on the fuzz,

45:00.264 --> 45:04.462
could run interference,
massage your shoulders.

45:04.535 --> 45:07.265
- Okay, easy there, tiger.
- Yeah.

45:07.337 --> 45:10.704
Thanks for the offer,
but I think we got it under control.

45:10.774 --> 45:12.969
Could I have a word with you?

45:18.615 --> 45:21.015
All right. I've got to be honest.

45:21.652 --> 45:24.553
I'm at a critical point
in my social development

45:24.621 --> 45:27.852
and those are two fine-looking,
hot women you have behind you,

45:27.925 --> 45:30.826
and let's face it,
you can't date them both.

45:32.396 --> 45:34.523
So, who do you have dibs on?

45:34.898 --> 45:38.834
Dibs? I don't have dibs, per se.

45:39.436 --> 45:40.630
Gotcha.

45:44.875 --> 45:46.274
Name's Mark.

45:47.044 --> 45:50.104
Hi, Mark. You're on poop duty.

45:50.180 --> 45:54.776
Okay. So, how many dogs
are we talking here?

45:54.852 --> 45:56.479
- Just six.
- Seven.

46:00.190 --> 46:01.885
What is that?

46:03.994 --> 46:07.054
Actually, this is the newest member
of our family.

46:07.131 --> 46:08.462
This is Henry.

46:08.532 --> 46:11.330
The poor guy was scrounging for food
in the junkyard.

46:11.401 --> 46:13.198
- Bruce, that...
- Andi.

46:13.270 --> 46:15.795
Honestly, we have enough room.
We could take one more.

46:15.873 --> 46:18.740
One more? We can fit, like, 10 more.
Think about that.

46:18.809 --> 46:20.299
Oh, yeah,
why don't we just wander the streets

46:20.377 --> 46:22.607
and rescue every stray we see?

46:26.884 --> 46:28.408
That was funny.

46:31.522 --> 46:34.184
<i>Dispatch to 22. We have a stray</i>
<i>on Saint Andrews and Sixth.</i>

46:34.258 --> 46:36.226
<i>Saint Andrews and Sixth.</i>

46:39.062 --> 46:41.963
Okay, guys, we've got a stray
on Saint Andrews and Sixth.

46:42.032 --> 46:44.330
That's Saint Andrews and Sixth.

46:45.569 --> 46:48.094
It's right near the pound, so hurry.

46:56.980 --> 47:00.848
Hello? Hi. Sorry to bother you.

47:00.918 --> 47:02.783
We were wondering
if we could have a minute of your time.

47:02.853 --> 47:05.083
- Not interested.
- We work for the school newspaper

47:05.155 --> 47:07.123
and we would love an interview.

47:07.191 --> 47:08.954
All right. You know what?
I don't have time for this.

47:09.026 --> 47:11.494
You guys just get out of here.
Skedaddle and play somewhere else.

47:11.562 --> 47:12.654
Okay.

47:16.366 --> 47:17.390
What's the matter?

47:17.467 --> 47:20.300
Never seen a husky kid
in a hoodie before?

47:21.505 --> 47:25.066
All right, guys,
get over to the old railroad depot ASAP.

47:26.343 --> 47:28.334
Over there. That's them.

47:31.715 --> 47:35.082
- He's stuck.
- Is she hurt?

47:38.689 --> 47:42.318
That's so sweet. They stayed together.
You okay?

47:42.392 --> 47:44.553
You're safe now.
We're gonna take care of you guys.

47:44.628 --> 47:46.061
Give me paw.

47:49.399 --> 47:51.594
There's that white one again.

47:52.269 --> 47:53.793
Let's get him.

47:54.504 --> 47:57.496
Here, doggy. Here, doggy.

47:59.810 --> 48:02.904
All right, come on, guys.
You're being rescued.

48:03.614 --> 48:06.310
Here, dog.
Hey, come back here, you mangy mutt.

48:06.383 --> 48:08.146
Hey! Come back here.

48:11.154 --> 48:14.385
All right, come on! Come on, everybody.

48:14.858 --> 48:17.053
Come on. Come on. Come on.

48:17.527 --> 48:21.361
- Head to tail. Head to tail. Come on.
- Come on. Get across, guys.

48:21.431 --> 48:22.830
Go, go, go!

48:24.668 --> 48:27.967
Come on, trust it.
You can do it. Come on. Come on.

48:32.242 --> 48:33.266
Good boy.

48:33.343 --> 48:34.332
<i>Passengers loaded.</i>

48:34.411 --> 48:36.470
- <i>Heading back to base.</i>
- Copy that.

49:14.952 --> 49:17.614
- One, two, three, go!
- Okay. Okay. Go!

49:18.622 --> 49:19.714
- Wait!
- Oh, what's that?

49:19.790 --> 49:21.815
Hey, what is this? What's going on?

49:21.892 --> 49:24.554
- Thumb war.
- Thumb war? Any calls?

49:25.963 --> 49:27.225
Nothing.

49:32.436 --> 49:34.131
Where are all the dogs?

49:56.927 --> 50:01.227
<i>Thank you for riding the simulator.</i>
<i>Please exit for the next customer.</i>

50:03.433 --> 50:04.525
<i>Out!</i>

50:06.536 --> 50:07.662
<i>Next.</i>

50:11.408 --> 50:15.845
<i>And please keep your paws</i>
<i>inside the vehicle at all times.</i>

51:18.108 --> 51:21.976
Come on. Come on. Come on.

51:22.479 --> 51:25.312
There's gotta be something
you like to do.

51:47.137 --> 51:49.162
Go get her. Go get her.

53:06.950 --> 53:08.247
I'll get it.

53:12.756 --> 53:14.223
- Bernie.
- Oh, hey, Bernie.

53:14.291 --> 53:16.088
Excellent. Bernie.

53:16.159 --> 53:18.787
Carl, Lois, I'm gonna borrow the kids
for a second, is that okay?

53:18.862 --> 53:22.298
I don't know if you heard, but Lois and I
got a gig this weekend. Paid.

53:22.365 --> 53:23.855
Wow. Really?

53:23.934 --> 53:27.028
I'm gonna RSVP you and the missus
as a yes, right?

53:27.103 --> 53:30.266
I'm not sure that I'm actually gonna
be able to make it.

53:30.340 --> 53:32.501
What about that friend of yours
that owns the club?

53:32.576 --> 53:33.804
Oh, yeah, he's definitely gonna be there.

53:33.877 --> 53:35.538
Yeah? Excellent.

53:37.881 --> 53:39.576
- I told you.
- Yeah.

53:40.550 --> 53:43.485
- So what is this emergency?
- Who cares? At least we're out of there.

53:43.553 --> 53:45.111
They were about to start band practice.

53:45.188 --> 53:46.553
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, Jason.

53:46.623 --> 53:50.992
Hey, guys, I think I may have found
the perfect foster parents for you.

53:52.229 --> 53:53.787
- Perfect?
- They're perfect.

53:53.863 --> 53:55.990
They had two foster kids
that just went off to college

53:56.066 --> 53:57.328
and they're looking for two more,

53:57.400 --> 53:59.891
and I think
you guys are really gonna love them.

53:59.970 --> 54:04.066
So that's it, no more Carl and Lois.
You guys get packed, you're out of here.

54:04.140 --> 54:05.607
Thank you, Bernie. Thank you.

54:05.675 --> 54:07.836
Best part about it is
it's only three hours away.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.606
You guys are free.

54:12.215 --> 54:14.240
- What?
- That far?

54:17.120 --> 54:19.315
Yes. What's the problem?

54:21.024 --> 54:25.518
- Well, we really like the area.
- We've made a lot of great friends.

54:25.595 --> 54:30.089
Yeah, and you know, Carl and Lois'
singing really grows on you.

54:31.134 --> 54:33.068
You hate Carl and Lois.

54:34.904 --> 54:36.769
Guys, what's going on?

54:37.907 --> 54:40.205
I mean, they want to make you
a part of their family.

54:40.277 --> 54:43.576
Look, we appreciate
everything you've done, but...

54:46.283 --> 54:49.184
Guys, you're not gonna get
another chance like this.

54:49.252 --> 54:51.482
I really think you should go.

54:54.190 --> 54:55.851
We'd like to stay.

54:57.961 --> 55:03.558
Well, I...
I have no idea what you guys are doing.

55:06.202 --> 55:07.931
We're really sorry.

55:29.025 --> 55:32.085
We're doing the right thing,
aren't we, Friday?

55:38.635 --> 55:40.660
Hey. What's up, puppy.

55:43.640 --> 55:45.130
Is everything okay?

55:45.208 --> 55:48.609
Yeah, yeah, just... Just looking.

55:48.678 --> 55:51.169
- You come up here a lot, huh?
- Yeah.

55:51.614 --> 55:54.481
I'm just guessing this is the kind of view
I wouldn't be able to afford

55:54.551 --> 55:56.883
if this place were a real hotel.

55:58.355 --> 56:02.758
So, what are you doing tomorrow night?

56:05.028 --> 56:08.361
Sneaking out,
serving 60 pounds of kibble,

56:08.431 --> 56:10.695
maybe mopping up some drool.

56:10.767 --> 56:13.668
'Cause a friend of mine
is having this party

56:13.737 --> 56:17.571
and you could come and meet some
people you'll be going to school with.

56:17.640 --> 56:20.336
The keyword here really being "people."

56:22.512 --> 56:23.877
Good point.

56:24.948 --> 56:27.883
Great. So, where should I pick you up?

56:30.086 --> 56:33.522
Why don't you just tell me where it is?
I can meet you there.

56:33.590 --> 56:34.921
All right.

56:44.868 --> 56:46.358
That's dinner.

57:17.333 --> 57:20.200
- Hey, guys.
- You guys ready for dinner?

57:22.806 --> 57:24.706
Are you hungry, buddy?

57:30.013 --> 57:31.503
Smells great.

57:32.048 --> 57:34.346
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

57:36.986 --> 57:38.180
Thanks.

58:12.589 --> 58:13.783
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

58:13.857 --> 58:17.850
So, Heather,
it's kind of like a dinner date, isn't it?

58:27.704 --> 58:30.366
To us. To a real family.

58:32.308 --> 58:34.037
- To us.
- To us.

58:34.110 --> 58:35.737
- Cheers!
- To us.

58:35.812 --> 58:37.177
Let's eat.

58:51.160 --> 58:54.561
If cartoon birds and mice were ever
going to make me a dress for the ball,

58:54.631 --> 58:56.622
now would be a good time.

59:00.970 --> 59:05.464
- How long are you gonna be gone?
- A few hours, maybe. It's just a party.

59:07.710 --> 59:09.837
What if anything goes wrong?

59:10.280 --> 59:11.975
Bruce, you can handle it.
You can handle anything.

59:12.048 --> 59:14.642
I mean, have you stopped
and looked around the hotel?

59:14.717 --> 59:15.979
I could disappear for a week

59:16.052 --> 59:18.145
and you'd be able
to keep everything running.

59:18.221 --> 59:21.588
Yeah, but you're not gonna
disappear for a week, right?

59:21.658 --> 59:23.057
Of course not.

59:23.126 --> 59:26.527
Now, if you could just build me a dress,
then you'd be a real wizard.

59:26.596 --> 59:28.826
You should check out room 502.

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:26.447
You look... Wow, you...
You look gorgeous.

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:28.353
What, this old thing?

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:32.224
Here, come on in.
Let me show you around.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:37.260
No! No, Lois!
That's my personal, that's...

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:46.703
- So what else have you stolen?
- Nothing.

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:50.872
- So you admit you did steal it.
- Never said that, Lois.

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:53.040
You might as well tell the truth.

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:55.914
Do you really think
you could outsmart us?

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:59.578
I'd rather not answer that question, Carl.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.484
- I love your dress.
- Thanks.

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:07.153
Marianne, this is Andi.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.926
She's gonna be going to school
with us next year.

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.990
- Nice to meet you.
- Andi.

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:17.965
- Hey, Jason.
- Hey.

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:19.235
- How you doing?
- All right.

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:23.039
- You guys already know each other?
- Yeah, it's Andi, right?

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:25.069
Do I know you from somewhere?

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:28.379
Yeah, you live in my grandmother's
building with the Scudders.

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:32.114
No, I'm over on Oak.
I have one of those faces, though.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.588
No, you live with the Scudders.

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:37.217
Come on, help me out here,
I'm not crazy.

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:41.593
They're your foster parents,
you and your little brother... Barry.

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:44.997
- Bruce?
- Bruce, Bruce, Bruce. That's it, Bruce.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.667
Andi, what is he talking about?

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:52.864
Oh, my God, you guys, it's no big deal.

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:56.343
So I guess the Scudders have been
foster parents before, big deal.

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:58.277
They're also our aunt and uncle.

01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:02.283
We're just staying with them
while our parents are traveling in China,

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:04.842
and we just call them our parents
because it is easier

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:08.357
than talking about
this whole long boring story, okay?

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:11.484
I'm thirsty, anyone else?

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:14.424
Anyone?

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:22.868
Andi, I...

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:26.834
Andi!

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:49.686
- Did you get a hold of Bernie yet?
- I'm on hold!

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:52.853
Well, tell them it's an emergency.
Tell them I'm being stolen from.

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:55.898
Tell who? I'm on hold!

01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:00.864
Don't think this means that...

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.964
You let him get away!

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.300
Friday?

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:31.050
- Hurry up!
- I'm wearing heels!

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:32.651
Well, so am I!

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:39.668
- I can't believe they own a hotel.
- Oh, God, Carl, you're such an idiot!

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.811
Stay close to me, baby.

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:55.907
What was that?

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:02.283
Don't answer it.

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:13.298
Hey, that's my wah-wah pedal.
No wonder my sound's been off.

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:14.996
Yeah, that's why.

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:17.363
This crap is amazing.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.967
Yeah, 'cause it's our crap.
They've been robbing us blind.

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:27.314
Good girl. Drop it! Georgia, drop it!

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:29.681
- Bruce, Bruce!
- Let go. Georgia, let go of it!

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:31.743
- Drop it, please!
- Bruce!

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:35.112
What happened?

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:37.423
Don't ask.

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:40.794
What happened with you?

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:55.270
Oh, no!

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:09.723
- Let's get out of here. Where's the exit?
- Like I left bread crumbs.

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:12.190
Quick, guys, go, go!

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:19.696
- Put the lights back on!
- I didn't do it!

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:25.863
What is that?

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:32.371
- I don't know. Let's get out of here!
- Oh, God! Shut it!

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:48.089
Are you sure they said
it was coming from here?

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:49.563
Don't know.

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.164
Let's check upstairs.

01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:59.034
- Did you hear the cops?
- I don't know.

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:00.905
Oh, good.

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:04.168
Well, if those were cops,

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:07.647
we're gonna turn them in ourselves,
'cause I smell reward.

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:10.378
I don't think that's reward you smell.

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:21.194
Where are we?

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:23.964
We're in deep doo-doo.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:35.974
Okay. Stop breathing like that.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.680
No. No.

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:52.417
- No.
- Don't.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.180
Get them in there.

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:34.234
No! What are you doing? Friday!
You can't do this! No! Friday!

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:35.930
- Bruce!
- Friday!

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:41.073
Friday! Let go of me! That's my dog!

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:42.701
Bruce! Just go!

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.751
It's okay.

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:31.459
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:38.930
- We're in a lot of trouble, aren't we?
- Yeah.

01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:44.935
But Bernie's doing
everything he can to help. Okay?

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:48.806
Look, is there any way
that they could just stay with you

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:51.311
for a little while longer
until I can find a family that'll take them?

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:55.749
Not a chance. God knows
how much they've stolen from us.

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:59.879
We have a lot of very rare
and valuable items in our home, okay?

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:02.822
And we are gonna go
and do a full inventory

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:06.657
and we're letting you know, all right?
This is an outrage. An outrage!

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:10.460
I'm suing you. I'm suing those kids.
I'm suing the state.

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:12.863
I'm suing the guy
that invented shrink wrap.

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:14.664
I'm suing everyone!

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:23.340
So you're gonna send us
to that other house now, right?

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:25.039
That nice couple?

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:29.011
- Bruce...
- Bruce, we're gonna be fine.

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:31.518
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

01:11:33.322 --> 01:11:37.190
Come on, Bernie.
You have to help us, please.

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:39.789
Bruce needs me.
He's gonna get chewed up out there.

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:43.195
Andi, I'm sorry, okay?
There's nothing I can do about it.

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:44.755
You can't separate us, okay?

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:47.893
Don't punish him
just because I screwed things up.

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:50.404
Listen, the best thing you can do
for Bruce right now

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:52.702
is let him have a fresh start.

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:55.207
I'm sorry.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:59.042
Can't I just say one thing to my sister?

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:16.320
Look, Andi, don't worry about me, okay?
I'm gonna be fine.

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:20.630
I was supposed to keep us together.
I was supposed to protect us.

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:23.103
Andi, we had to protect the dogs.

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:28.002
If I had to do it over again,
I'd do the exact same thing.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.325
First come, first served!

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:48.320
- Tomorrow morning for all of them.
- Yep.

01:13:56.899 --> 01:14:00.062
- We're gonna be busy.
- I can use the overtime.

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:19.379
And which one are you?

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:23.282
They must have left you behind.
You're the lucky one.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:25.013
Come here, buddy.

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:29.247
<i>I know how to sit,</i>
<i>how to fetch and how to roll over.</i>

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.551
<i>What I don't know</i>
<i>is how I ended up in here.</i>

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:38.223
Could you please turn that off?

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:45.362
- Please.
- I did turn it off.

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:13.753
Hey!

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:41.149
- You busy?
- Friday!

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:47.425
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:48.588
So what's the plan?

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.963
The dogs have less than a day left.
We've got to get them out of there now.

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:54.332
Okay, that's really
more a goal than a plan.

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:56.303
There's a no-kill shelter
outside the city,

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.498
so if we can get them out of the pound
and over the county line,

01:17:58.573 --> 01:18:00.234
then they're home free.

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:02.105
- Right.
- But we gotta move quick.

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:04.270
Andi, what happens to us?

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:07.346
It's...

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:11.152
Look, Bruce, it's not gonna be good.

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:14.711
We're gonna be in more trouble
than we've ever been in.

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:19.986
But we're gonna save the dogs.

01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:22.690
It's what we're supposed to do, right?

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:24.897
Okay, guys.

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:30.366
Okay, so here's the pound,
and this is the county line,

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:31.963
and this is what we're gonna do.

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:40.737
Are we ready?

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:44.374
Let's do this!

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.953
Got sausage.

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:51.755
Fire! Fire! Fire! Hello?

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:54.022
When a young girl is screaming for help
and yelling, "Fire,"

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:55.620
- you're supposed to get moving!
- I have water.

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:58.029
Fire! Hello?

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:01.599
- Where?
- And they say chivalry is dead.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.570
It's right over there.

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:08.634
Hey!

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.910
A bunch of kids eager to adopt, I bet.

01:19:13.982 --> 01:19:16.542
- Where are the keys?
- There!

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:21.682
You didn't think we'd forget you,
did you?

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:23.884
Come on! Let's go. Come on.

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:27.921
I missed you guys, too.
Come on. Let's go! Come on!

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:30.988
Let's go, Shep! Come on, let's go!

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:35.366
- Let's go for a run, you guys, come on!
- Go, go, go!

01:19:43.845 --> 01:19:45.073
Checking out.

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:46.580
We're gonna get you guys out of here.
Come on.

01:19:46.648 --> 01:19:48.673
Hurry up, Thor, gotta go!

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.149
Let's go, let's go!

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:57.550
Way to go, Shep! Good girl.

01:19:57.926 --> 01:20:00.861
Okay, the coast is clear.
Bring her on back.

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:06.092
What's going on here?

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:09.069
I know you. All right, let's go.
You're going to jail.

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:10.468
Trouble! Trouble!

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:14.669
We can do this hard or we can do it
easy. Let's go, missy. Come on.

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:17.436
Keep your paws off of her.

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:23.774
Heather, save yourself!
Save yourself! Go! I have him!

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:31.652
Nobody's going anywhere.

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:36.362
Get back in there.

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.134
Keys.

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:52.237
Hey!

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:04.487
Okay, Friday,
you're gonna lead the pack.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.487
- Mark!
- Yes?

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:09.530
Thank you!

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:12.897
Come on, Friday. A little faster, buddy!
You can do it!

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:16.062
Follow the sausage, Friday.
Follow the sausage!

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.298
- Well, that went well.
- Yeah, well, we're not done yet.

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:33.514
Come on, Friday, lead your pack!
Good boy!

01:21:33.588 --> 01:21:37.490
Come on, guys, follow the meat!
Come on! That's it, Friday, let's go.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:05.015
Oh, that's not good.

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:32.439
Hey!

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:40.511
- You guys, are we there yet?
- We're almost there, just up ahead.

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:54.525
Wait. What? Oh, no!

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:00.902
Friday!

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:06.844
Guys, come back! This way!
Problem. They just went the other way.

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:08.075
What?

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:15.886
Where are they going?

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:21.261
Home. They're going home.

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:07.668
Block the exits.
Make sure they don't get back out.

01:24:07.742 --> 01:24:09.141
Let's get some more
Animal Control out here.

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.235
- How much?
- All of it.

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:17.314
<i>We need all available Animal Control</i>
<i>units. All available Animal Control units.</i>

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:38.265
It is pure bedlam down here

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:40.500
as authorities try
to take control of the situation.

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:43.009
This scheme was supposedly
the work of several juvenile delinquents.

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:45.871
Upstairs, right now, let's go!

01:24:45.947 --> 01:24:49.439
There's no need to get upset, Officer.
Animal Control is on the scene.

01:24:49.517 --> 01:24:51.382
All right, everybody,
if you can just let us do our job,

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.318
we'll have all these
dangerous canines rounded up

01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:55.856
and out of your hair presently.

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.186
- Stop!
- Can I get through here?

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:58.691
- Watch out. Please?
- Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.352
Oh, no, no, no, no! Not you again!

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:03.397
- Those dogs belong to us.
- They're family.

01:25:03.465 --> 01:25:05.456
Yeah, we're not gonna let you
coverall-wearing goons

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:08.127
take them away from us.
And you can put that in your report.

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:11.263
Officer, would you please arrest
these young felons right now

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:14.172
- so we can get back to work?
- Fine! Just leave the dogs alone!

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:16.506
Andi! There he is!

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:18.239
That's our dog!
You can't just take him away!

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:22.044
- Oh, what do we got here? A puppy!
- Just leave my dog alone!

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:25.149
Stop!

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:34.019
- Okay. Now, who are you?
- I'm Bernie Wilkins.

01:25:39.367 --> 01:25:40.959
Social Services.

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.997
Okay, get them out of here!

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:47.942
Come on, listen.
Can you just hear me out

01:25:48.009 --> 01:25:52.446
before you throw these kids in jail
and destroy all these innocent dogs?

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:59.781
I see no reason
why we can't hear both sides.

01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:05.053
Look. I'm responsible for these kids,
and I know what they did was wrong.

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:10.654
But I gotta tell you,
I wish I had the guts to do what they did.

01:26:12.867 --> 01:26:16.997
I've been trying to place kids
in good homes for 15 years

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:19.403
and most of the time,
I'm not successful.

01:26:19.474 --> 01:26:22.272
But these kids,
they didn't make excuses.

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:24.675
They didn't get frustrated
with the system and give up.

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:28.079
They just went out and did it.
They saved everybody.

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:34.113
They created their own little family.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:38.182
You call this a family? A bunch
of mangy strays in an old hotel?

01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:47.799
"Madison."

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:53.802
Madison.

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:01.409
Madison.

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:04.884
"August 3rd,

01:27:04.953 --> 01:27:09.652
"found hiding in a backyard after the
family moved away and left her behind."

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:13.356
Viola and Sebastian, the twins.

01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:17.196
"Together since they were puppies.

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:18.994
"Viola got snagged on a fence,

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:22.332
"but Sebastian refused
to leave his sister behind."

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:24.165
"Chelsea.

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:28.401
"Chelsea lost her leg in an accident.

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:32.008
"The owner didn't pay the bill
and abandoned her at the vet."

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.743
"Coco, Rocky and Harley.

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:42.179
"Found living together
in the woods near a dump."

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.054
And there's many more.

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.319
"Ginger.

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:49.096
"Henry, Romeo, Juliet.

01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:51.793
"Cooper.

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:55.496
"Shep.

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:59.872
"George"? Does that say "George"?

01:28:00.742 --> 01:28:03.540
Georgia! Her name's Georgia.

01:28:03.978 --> 01:28:05.343
And Lenny.

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:11.479
Georgia and Lenny.

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:16.986
They're the first two residents
in this hotel.

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:18.787
The Hotel for Dogs.

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:23.455
No one was turned away
when they needed a home.

01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:28.191
Nobody was abandoned
when they were looking for a family.

01:28:28.269 --> 01:28:32.433
Are you really gonna tell me that
we're gonna just abandon them now?

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:47.013
They don't look like
mangy strays, Officer.

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:49.522
But you don't mind
if we take a look upstairs, do you?

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:52.525
I think it's in the public's best interest.

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:56.562
Be my guest.

01:29:27.161 --> 01:29:30.324
- You did great.
- You don't think I was too pushy?

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.689
I like pushy.

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:46.937
- Mark?
- Heather.

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:51.514
So, is this when the hero gets the girl?

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:55.086
Baby steps.

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:00.656
Do you mind if I...

01:30:02.964 --> 01:30:05.364
No. Okay, sorry.

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:11.399
You kids are heroes.
You should be proud.

01:30:11.472 --> 01:30:12.564
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.767
Yeah, but the bad news is, in all this,

01:30:14.842 --> 01:30:19.404
I still haven't been able to find a foster
family that's willing to take you guys.

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.914
That's okay, Bernie,
we know you tried your best.

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:23.814
But the good news is,

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:27.787
I have found some real parents
that might be willing to adopt.

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:31.921
- Adopt?
- Yeah.

01:30:31.993 --> 01:30:33.324
See, the mom is excellent.

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:35.726
She's a teacher,
so she's really great with kids.

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:38.425
And he cannot cook to save his life.

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:43.801
And he shouts during football games
like the players can actually hear him.

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:45.862
But he has a great heart.

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:50.567
Wait a minute.

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:53.941
Do they like dogs?

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:56.839
We love dogs.

01:31:21.509 --> 01:31:23.409
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:26.504
I'd like to welcome you
to the Hotel for Dogs.

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:32.715
Thanks to the generosity
of the entire city,

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:36.553
we are now able to take care
of all your canine needs.

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:38.353
Thank you, Georgia.
