03:54.629 --> 03:57.832
- You can drive down there.
- I'm already walking. Where is it?

03:57.965 --> 04:02.212
On the infill.
A guy from LA just went down.

04:02.344 --> 04:06.211
- What's he doing here?
- He waited a while for you,

04:06.348 --> 04:11.306
then decided to go and take a look
himself. Hope that's OK.

04:11.436 --> 04:14.602
Damn right it's OK.
With a bit of luck I'm going home.

04:16.565 --> 04:18.641
- What have we got?
- A derelict.

04:18.776 --> 04:20.399
They cut his throat.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.603
- Who are you?
- Trimble.

04:22.738 --> 04:24.529
Where do you fit in?

04:24.656 --> 04:28.903
His father's the manager. He was
shooting vermin and found the body.

04:29.035 --> 04:34.277
Get ready, cos you're in for a shock.
They slit him from ear to ear.

04:34.415 --> 04:39.871
- Do you want me to make a statement?
- Not right now. Thank you.

04:46.676 --> 04:49.167
- Did you bring it?
- Hope I'm not intruding.

04:49.304 --> 04:51.841
Be my guest.
What have you got?

04:51.973 --> 04:56.634
Old guy offed himself with a knife.
Can't find the knife.

04:56.769 --> 04:58.429
They cut his throat.

04:58.812 --> 05:03.189
Get behind the tape
and tell your father to put that fire out.

05:03.316 --> 05:04.894
That ain't legal.

05:06.444 --> 05:11.106
- What would make him do that?
- Don't annoy me, Travis.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.775
- So where's the knife?
- I don't know.

05:14.910 --> 05:17.697
I guess that dozer must have shifted it.

05:17.829 --> 05:20.237
You're gonna need some hands
up here to look.

05:20.373 --> 05:22.911
You heard look for the knife.

05:24.335 --> 05:27.371
You, too, move that ass.

05:27.505 --> 05:32.001
- You do the pockets.
- No, sir. I haven't started till Monday.

05:34.303 --> 05:36.094
I'm a tourist.

05:36.221 --> 05:39.091
Welcome to Eureka.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.317
How long has he been feeling like this?

05:52.444 --> 05:56.607
A week or two. Must have been
on kerosene. Stinks like a diesel engine.

05:58.366 --> 06:00.691
Mr Blattis of our local newspaper.

06:01.744 --> 06:04.994
- You sure it's suicide?
- Yeah. It was well rehearsed.

06:05.122 --> 06:06.747
What does that mean?

06:06.874 --> 06:09.875
Cut your own throat...
you're nervous and you hesitate.

06:10.002 --> 06:14.213
He's got three trial cuts, lower left side
of the neck before the big one.

06:14.339 --> 06:17.174
Got a dead dog here, sergeant.

06:17.300 --> 06:20.585
Find the knife!
Venables, has the coroner called?

06:20.720 --> 06:22.428
Yes, sir. He's delayed.

06:23.556 --> 06:25.347
All right, I'm out of here.

06:25.474 --> 06:27.929
I'll catch you later, Freddy T.

06:28.060 --> 06:31.263
How does anyone
as dead as this lose a knife?

06:33.231 --> 06:35.603
What about that kid, Ross?

06:35.733 --> 06:40.691
Shit. Of course, the kid.

06:42.907 --> 06:46.607
Travis. Find that kid
and get the knife off him.

06:46.743 --> 06:49.578
He's gonna lie,
but he's got it, so get it.

06:50.997 --> 06:54.164
Get on with it.
What are you staring at?

06:54.292 --> 06:58.621
- I think I've found something horrible.
- What do you mean?

06:59.672 --> 07:01.795
I think I've found a hand.

07:11.933 --> 07:14.637
You're right.
It's a fucking hand.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.402
What do you think?

07:37.289 --> 07:39.447
I think you're here all day.

07:51.135 --> 07:54.835
How much longer are we here?
We ain't gonna find anything else.

07:54.972 --> 07:58.554
Give it another hour.
Did the photographer do the dogs?

07:58.684 --> 08:01.554
- Dogs?
- There's two dogs.

08:01.686 --> 08:03.560
He should do the dogs.

08:03.688 --> 08:06.772
Got a brassiere here.
Looks like it could be blood.

08:06.899 --> 08:09.390
- All right I'm coming.
- Shit.

08:09.527 --> 08:12.693
The coroner wants to know
if we can release the derelict.

08:12.821 --> 08:14.565
Yeah, he can go.

08:14.698 --> 08:19.940
I think I'll lay down with him.
It's the only way I'm gonna get out of here.

08:20.078 --> 08:22.569
It's good to be with you, Ross.

08:25.875 --> 08:28.247
Glad you finally made it, bro.

08:43.140 --> 08:48.383
- Want an umbrella?
- Yeah, thanks. Give me hand with this?

08:48.520 --> 08:51.438
- Is this normal?
- Pisses down October to June.

08:51.565 --> 08:54.234
- How long have you known Freddy?
- Ross?

08:54.359 --> 08:58.403
- He was my sergeant when I was a rookie.
- He got you the job?

08:58.530 --> 09:01.649
He would have if he could have.
He's been trying long enough.

09:04.493 --> 09:06.402
Welcome aboard.
Caught the rain?

09:07.538 --> 09:12.662
Sergeant Serato, Taylor and Travis I think
you know. I'll be with you in a minute.

09:12.792 --> 09:16.541
Do me a favour.
Bring the rest of the stuff out of the car.

09:16.671 --> 09:19.458
Hey, Travis, don't lose it.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.217
Find the knife, sergeant?

09:25.346 --> 09:27.552
No, but we have a theory.

09:27.681 --> 09:30.302
The kid told me he didn't take it.

09:30.433 --> 09:32.924
Maybe he was lying to you.

09:41.235 --> 09:43.808
Is it true you found a hand?

09:46.615 --> 09:48.192
Is that it?

09:48.325 --> 09:52.025
- Interview over, Blattis.
- Come on, chief.

09:52.161 --> 09:55.862
If it's sensitive, just tell me.
I'm not taking notes.

09:55.998 --> 10:00.660
We got a body part. We don't know
what it is. Probably hospital debris.

10:00.794 --> 10:03.463
Now you know as much as we do.

10:03.589 --> 10:06.293
- Was it male or female?
- A woman's hand.

10:06.424 --> 10:08.132
I'm grateful for your candour.

10:08.259 --> 10:12.506
Keep this out of the paper.
That dump serves a dozen communities.

10:12.638 --> 10:15.841
We don't know if it's ours.
So don't worry about it.

10:15.975 --> 10:18.726
- Was it frozen?
- Come on, get out.

10:18.852 --> 10:23.229
This guy's trying to move in.
Anything new, you'll be the first to know.

10:23.356 --> 10:27.436
- Why did he ask if it was frozen?
- I couldn't tell you.

10:27.569 --> 10:31.186
Don't worry about any of this.
By the time you're back it's gone.

10:36.660 --> 10:41.701
You scared me!
Look at you. You look good.

10:41.832 --> 10:43.741
Do a rush on three pizzas.

10:43.875 --> 10:46.413
Pizza? I haven't seen him in year.

10:46.544 --> 10:49.794
Dinner's another night.
I've only got an hour.

10:49.922 --> 10:51.915
Bobby's out.
What's the rush?

10:52.049 --> 10:54.919
Friday night at City Hall.
I got a chance to frighten the fat.

10:55.052 --> 10:57.128
- Freddy's new obsession.
- Who is who?

10:57.262 --> 11:00.512
A bitch with an ass the size of Africa.

11:00.640 --> 11:04.340
- So tonight she confesses?
- Tonight if you're lucky.

11:06.813 --> 11:10.561
- Not for me.
- I opened it for you. French champagne.

11:10.691 --> 11:12.767
- It's Californian.
- Even better.

11:12.901 --> 11:16.021
- I'll have diet soda. I'm on a diet today.
- Since when do you drink diet soda?

11:16.154 --> 11:21.397
Since he started looking so good.
Don't pay attention to him. You look great.

11:21.534 --> 11:23.942
- How's your house?
- It's OK.

11:24.078 --> 11:27.198
- What does that mean?
- Not too good in daylight.

11:27.331 --> 11:31.031
Just shut your eyes till it's painted.
You'll love it.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.077
- This is God's country.
- So I hear.

11:58.860 --> 12:03.568
Hi. This is Mike Blattis, Eureka News.
I'm out of the office right now...

12:05.324 --> 12:07.945
Can somebody drop these off for me?

12:08.076 --> 12:11.160
- Sure. I'll take care of it.
- Thanks.

12:11.288 --> 12:14.787
Are you winning, sergeant?

12:15.875 --> 12:19.873
You know something about that hand?
I think it was frozen.

12:20.004 --> 12:23.373
- Frozen?
- Yeah. What does that mean to you?

12:23.507 --> 12:25.298
How you doing?

12:26.551 --> 12:28.840
Come on Venables, you're a policeman.

12:28.970 --> 12:31.675
A policeman always has an answer.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.633
- Well, sir.
- Well what?

12:34.767 --> 12:37.970
We had a real bad murder
a couple of years ago.

12:38.104 --> 12:42.183
Not in our county, but south of here.
A girl with no head and no hands.

12:42.316 --> 12:45.400
You didn't read about it?
It was big shit.

12:45.527 --> 12:49.571
40 or 50 detectives were working on it
and never identified her.

12:49.697 --> 12:52.105
Never found the head,
nor the hands.

12:52.241 --> 12:56.986
Could be a crazy guy kept the hand
in a freezer, and wants to get rid of it.

12:57.121 --> 13:00.157
- Where's the file?
- In there if there's anything.

13:00.290 --> 13:04.240
It'll be under "John Taylor".
I believe the code is "Jennifer".

13:04.377 --> 13:09.086
- Was it really frozen, sergeant?
- No. Been dead two weeks.

13:09.215 --> 13:11.524
- Notice anything weird about it?
- No.

13:12.024 --> 13:15.406
Look.
One, two, three...

13:16.706 --> 13:18.497
four, five.

13:20.684 --> 13:23.158
Six, seven, this long one, eight...

13:24.211 --> 13:26.226
...nine, ten.

13:26.712 --> 13:30.854
I count 11 scars on this hand. And
there's four more that might be scars.

13:31.068 --> 13:34.022
Now, I count them on my hand.
I have 5.

13:34.154 --> 13:37.404
I'm 37 years old. This girl's about 18.

13:37.532 --> 13:40.901
- How come she has so many scars?
- I don't know.

13:41.036 --> 13:43.075
That's the question.

13:47.792 --> 13:51.706
So. Why don't you tell me about Jennifer?

13:51.837 --> 13:54.079
You know I'm going to find out.

13:54.214 --> 13:58.627
It's an unsolved. They spent about
$500,000 for a dead end.

13:58.760 --> 14:03.256
- Check with Taylor. He worked the case.
- I did. What's his problem?

14:03.389 --> 14:07.007
This. He thinks you stole his promotion.

14:09.812 --> 14:13.643
- What exactly are you doing there?
- It's to quit smoking.

14:13.774 --> 14:17.059
That's interesting.
It must help with the withdrawal.

14:17.193 --> 14:20.396
It's a technique I read about.
Smoke 60 a day...

14:20.530 --> 14:25.571
...throw one cigarette away, smoke 59.
Day two, throw two out, smoke 58.

14:25.701 --> 14:29.449
- Why not just smoke none?
- It's a ritual. You got to do it.

14:29.580 --> 14:34.656
- Do you want my advice?
- Find yourself a farmer's daughter

14:34.793 --> 14:36.536
with nice big tits

14:36.669 --> 14:40.168
and shake that bye-bye.
Send it to Sacramento.

14:40.298 --> 14:41.673
I sniff grief.

14:49.348 --> 14:52.847
- You're done except for the floor.
- Thanks. You're a saint.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.144
Don't forget the wagon.
Bobby, help me with this.

14:58.272 --> 15:02.222
- I'm dying.
- OK. Let's go.

15:15.455 --> 15:19.286
- All right. I'm fucked.
- You've got to stop smoking.

15:23.337 --> 15:27.583
- If I can do it, you can.
- How did you do it, old man?

15:28.633 --> 15:30.791
Somebody bet me a dollar.

15:30.927 --> 15:33.465
It's not worth quitting for a dollar.

15:33.596 --> 15:36.301
All right, I'll bet 50 dollars.

15:38.392 --> 15:40.183
50 dollars?

15:47.650 --> 15:49.607
You got a bet.

15:49.736 --> 15:54.812
JB, it's Ronzo. You know that brassiere
you sent me? I got some results.

15:54.949 --> 16:00.239
First - the blood is human, and it's not a
popular brand. AB negative and that's rare.

16:00.370 --> 16:04.498
Two - the blood on the brassiere is
compatible with the blood from the hand.

16:04.624 --> 16:10.413
And three - anything else, the answer
from all us in Los Angeles is "fuck off".

16:10.546 --> 16:13.037
And shoot me a duck,
would you? Bye.

16:13.174 --> 16:17.752
- What are you going to do now, soldier?
- Dig up Jennifer.

16:23.350 --> 16:27.845
- What is that?
- A laser enhancement of the fingertip.

16:27.979 --> 16:31.893
It's really bothering me.
You see these striations here?

16:32.024 --> 16:35.808
It's like she's always worrying
the end of her finger.

16:37.821 --> 16:40.572
Rubbing it... rubbing it...

16:40.699 --> 16:43.155
rubbing it with her
thumbnail or something.

16:43.688 --> 16:45.360
Almost identical to Jennifer.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.685
Slim, white, same age.
Her bra size is even the same.

16:50.499 --> 16:54.199
- Nicely made lady.
- How do you know her hair's black?

16:54.336 --> 16:56.874
The hair on her hand.
And Jennifer had black hair.

16:57.005 --> 16:58.748
What's with this Jennifer stuff?

16:58.882 --> 17:01.503
- These cases aren't connected.
- I think they may be.

17:01.634 --> 17:04.469
I think Jennifer and this lady
got hit by the same guy.

17:04.595 --> 17:09.056
I have four points of positive
comparison on the cut.

17:09.183 --> 17:13.180
That's all very interesting,
but where's the body?

17:13.310 --> 17:16.478
I don't know much about this Jennifer
except what I've heard.

17:16.606 --> 17:21.184
The principle feature of the case
was a gruesome display of the body.

17:21.319 --> 17:25.980
So if this is the same guy,
why has he hidden this one?

17:26.115 --> 17:30.159
Just wondered if you'd had time
to get around to my pharmacy stuff.

17:30.285 --> 17:32.574
You'll have it in the morning.

17:34.372 --> 17:36.945
I'll try again tomorrow. Chief.

17:37.083 --> 17:41.211
You're probably making him feel
antsy with this back on the wall.

17:41.337 --> 17:45.714
- I thought it was Taylor's case.
- It sucked in officers all over the county.

17:45.841 --> 17:49.174
It was the worst six months
this station ever had.

17:49.302 --> 17:53.169
Why don't you give it a minute
and stop by my office? We should talk.

17:53.306 --> 17:58.466
- So what does he think it is?
- Everything it isn't.

17:58.603 --> 18:00.346
Make a left.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.100
He even tried self-inflicted.

18:03.232 --> 18:06.482
- It's possible.
- Give me a break.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.442
It's the garage in the far corner.

18:18.787 --> 18:21.004
- You can't stop it can you?
- What?

18:21.446 --> 18:23.394
The worrying, the clicking,
the picking.

18:23.746 --> 18:25.686
You might as well be
back in Los Angeles.

18:29.714 --> 18:32.798
Why don't you dump it?
Mail it off?

18:35.386 --> 18:38.303
Give it to the FBI... a present.

18:41.183 --> 18:44.349
Stay here.
You might not be finished yet.

19:22.262 --> 19:28.134
I just got an insane idea. If I'm wrong,
I'll redecorate the entire house.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.888
She's blind. That's why all the scars.

19:31.020 --> 19:33.142
Here that traffic light?

19:33.272 --> 19:35.311
That noise is for blind people.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.643
That's why she has marks
on her fingertips. She reads in Braille.

19:47.451 --> 19:48.780
Who's next?

19:48.911 --> 19:52.825
Amber Stone, 19 years old,
last seen six weeks ago.

20:01.047 --> 20:04.380
- Is this the last one?
- One more to go.

20:06.302 --> 20:09.006
Welcome to Shasta Trinity Institute.

20:09.138 --> 20:12.506
Reception is through the double doors
and to your right.

20:12.641 --> 20:17.349
- What exactly is your interest in Amber?
- I'm afraid I can't answer that.

20:17.478 --> 20:21.428
As I explained to your secretary,
we're doing a lot of looking.

20:21.565 --> 20:24.235
We're not even
sure it's Amber we're looking for.

20:24.360 --> 20:28.571
And what do you hope I'll do?
Dissuade or persuade you?

20:28.697 --> 20:34.201
I was hoping you might remember
something to give us an idea where she is.

20:34.327 --> 20:37.079
Then you could have saved
yourself a lot of driving.

20:37.205 --> 20:40.371
What I said on the phone
is what I'm saying now.

20:40.499 --> 20:43.583
I have no idea where she is
or who took her there.

20:43.711 --> 20:49.001
And, I might add, in five weeks,
150 students will be leaving here

20:49.132 --> 20:53.260
for Christmas holidays with people
whose names I won't know either.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.675
Excuse me.

21:00.726 --> 21:03.810
You have an appointment
with Miss Robertson?

21:03.937 --> 21:07.353
Apparently she saw Amber
the weekend she left,

21:07.482 --> 21:10.732
and was briefly in the room
with the man she left with.

21:10.860 --> 21:11.891
I see.

21:13.738 --> 21:16.738
She teaches another
class at four o' clock.

21:16.866 --> 21:19.700
I'd appreciate it if you don't detain her.

21:22.496 --> 21:25.200
How come this place is so big?

21:25.332 --> 21:27.454
Where is everyone?

21:27.584 --> 21:31.913
I don't know. He said this was
the staff side of the building.

21:37.885 --> 21:40.458
What did you think of that fucking idiot?

21:41.930 --> 21:46.259
He had a handshake
like a partially excited penis.

21:48.686 --> 21:53.146
Hi. Sergeants John Berlin, Frederick Ross.
We have an appointment.

21:57.653 --> 22:02.195
What do you want to ask, Mr Berlin?
Please sit down.

22:05.827 --> 22:09.776
I'd like you tell me, any way you like,

22:09.914 --> 22:13.329
what you can remember
about the time you spent with Amber...

22:13.459 --> 22:15.784
...on the afternoon she left.

22:15.919 --> 22:19.003
Well, I think I told you on the phone...

22:21.132 --> 22:24.003
I went up to her room to say goodbye...

22:24.135 --> 22:29.721
we sat on the bed and chatted while
her friend was collecting her things.

22:29.848 --> 22:34.391
What kind of friend?
Boyfriend? Old friend? New friend?

22:34.519 --> 22:35.634
I don't know.

22:35.770 --> 22:38.855
Do you have any idea
what this friend was like?

22:38.982 --> 22:41.982
- Do you know how old he was?
- No.

22:42.110 --> 22:45.076
Let me put it this way.
How old do you think I am?

22:45.775 --> 22:49.162
- 26, 39 or 53.
- 53.

22:53.370 --> 22:55.493
You must have some idea.

22:55.622 --> 22:58.243
When we spoke on the phone,
did you know I was blonde?

22:58.374 --> 23:01.660
- No.
- Why not? You heard my voice.

23:01.794 --> 23:06.041
We don't have some sixth sense,
except in ridiculous novels.

23:08.175 --> 23:11.092
If I hadn't known,
I would have thought he was blind.

23:11.219 --> 23:12.250
Blind? Why?

23:12.387 --> 23:16.515
Because he was comfortable with us.
He shook hands like blind people do.

23:16.641 --> 23:19.642
- How's that?
- Blind people often use both hands.

23:19.769 --> 23:22.057
- And he did that?
- Yes.

23:24.148 --> 23:26.057
He used breath freshener.

23:27.693 --> 23:30.646
I think his name was John.

23:30.779 --> 23:33.863
You never mentioned that on the phone.
Why do you think that?

23:33.990 --> 23:37.690
She must have called him John.
I don't know.

23:37.827 --> 23:42.572
I'm making some tea.
Would you like some?

23:44.583 --> 23:45.994
Sure.

23:49.713 --> 23:53.461
- I think we got something here.
- We got a witness.

23:53.591 --> 23:56.963
- Give me some time. She might
remember something. - She's blind.

23:57.383 --> 24:00.381
You'd be better off talking to
one of these Beethoven guys here.

24:03.850 --> 24:05.510
This is crazy.

24:05.644 --> 24:08.893
Two hours here and back
and all I got "John".

24:12.233 --> 24:15.602
You said he spoke.
Can you remember what he said?

24:15.736 --> 24:20.647
He just said, "Come on. Hurry up.
It's starting to snow again. "

24:21.992 --> 24:26.534
He was breathless from carrying the cases
because the elevator had gone out.

24:27.205 --> 24:28.747
- It wasn't working?
- No.

24:28.873 --> 24:31.743
It has a mind of its own.

24:31.876 --> 24:34.248
Four o' clock pm.

24:34.378 --> 24:37.248
- Well.
- Can I see your hands?

24:38.423 --> 24:40.416
- My hands?
- Yes.

24:46.139 --> 24:48.712
I have a class.
I have to go.

24:48.849 --> 24:52.183
Can you tell me anything else
about him or her?

24:52.311 --> 24:55.312
- It doesn't matter how small.
- No.

24:58.108 --> 25:00.065
Except he smoked like you.

25:01.903 --> 25:02.934
Me?

25:03.071 --> 25:07.566
I could smell it on his breath
like I can smell it on yours.

25:08.659 --> 25:11.364
I have a class. I'm late.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.457
Do you have a seeing eye dog?

25:18.585 --> 25:19.616
No.

25:19.753 --> 25:22.457
There's lots of scratch marks
on your door.

25:22.588 --> 25:26.087
Sometimes I look after friends' dogs
if they go to dances.

25:26.217 --> 25:29.632
Sergeant, can I just refer you
to this memo here?

25:29.762 --> 25:32.299
- Did Amber have a dog?
- Yes.

25:32.431 --> 25:35.634
- What colour was it?
- I don't know.

25:38.645 --> 25:43.390
If she writes or calls or anything...
you'll let me know?

25:43.524 --> 25:46.229
I'll leave a number with the office.

25:46.360 --> 25:49.230
50 fucking dollars, OK?

25:53.158 --> 25:56.158
What exactly do you teach, Helena?

25:56.286 --> 25:58.574
Music composition and 'cello.

26:02.666 --> 26:05.667
50 of them and I want them now.

26:11.216 --> 26:14.086
You are now on the fourth floor.

26:27.105 --> 26:30.272
Amber had a seeing eye dog
since she was 18.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.769
I knew that labrador
was too good to be dead.

26:33.903 --> 26:39.241
- We'd better get back to that dump.
- No way. I'm not going back.

26:39.366 --> 26:42.735
You might find someone's prick
in a hot dog roll.

26:42.870 --> 26:44.150
We're going.

27:08.268 --> 27:10.225
Get the light down here.

27:39.379 --> 27:43.839
In that bag you'll find a knife
and a pair of long-nosed pliers.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.990
Looks like a 22.

29:02.621 --> 29:04.530
Jesus, he said six.

29:06.667 --> 29:09.288
I want you to see Citrine with me.

29:09.419 --> 29:11.874
I know he'd listen to you.

29:12.005 --> 29:13.748
Listen to what?

29:13.881 --> 29:17.713
I want to take the Blind Institute
to pieces. Addresses, phone calls...

29:17.843 --> 29:21.841
- everybody there from the last five years.
- For a dead dog?

29:21.972 --> 29:27.179
We've got a major series here. This girl's
not the second victim. She's Jennifer Eight.

29:27.310 --> 29:30.346
I'm gonna see Citrine this afternoon.
Will you come?

29:30.480 --> 29:32.768
You're not.
He's out of town.

29:35.401 --> 29:37.109
You believe me, don't you?

29:37.236 --> 29:42.028
How does it matter what I believe?
You've got to worry what Citrine believes.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.446
But I can't help you with this.

29:45.619 --> 29:47.243
I'm sorry, brother.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.953
You're on your own.

31:25.292 --> 31:27.036
Is anyone there?

31:28.754 --> 31:29.868
Yes.

31:31.089 --> 31:33.758
It's John Berlin.

31:36.261 --> 31:38.502
Have you been here long?

31:38.638 --> 31:41.211
Just a minute or two.

31:42.308 --> 31:44.680
I knocked on your door.

31:44.810 --> 31:46.802
No one home.

31:47.771 --> 31:49.728
So I followed the music.

31:49.856 --> 31:51.398
I'm sorry.

31:52.567 --> 31:54.690
Let me get my things.

31:54.819 --> 31:57.985
It's not a problem.
I'm not in a hurry.

32:06.663 --> 32:10.791
As a matter of fact,
I saw a restaurant down the road.

32:10.917 --> 32:13.752
I thought maybe we could have lunch.

32:25.972 --> 32:28.380
Was someone here with you?

32:28.892 --> 32:31.643
When I came in the door was flapping.

32:33.646 --> 32:37.975
I don't think so.
No one comes here at weekends.

32:38.108 --> 32:43.612
- I must be the worst witness you ever had.
- I admit you are one of them.

32:43.738 --> 32:47.356
I just wish I knew what vehicle
you were talking about.

32:47.492 --> 32:50.392
Some cars sound fat,
some sound thin.

32:51.212 --> 32:53.650
This one sounded hollow.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.283
Maybe it was a foreign car.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.868
Our kind of cars sound fat.

33:01.004 --> 33:03.791
Are you sure you want to see it?

33:03.923 --> 33:06.544
It's another three floors up.

33:06.676 --> 33:08.300
Yes.

33:12.056 --> 33:15.839
- How often does it break down.
- All the time.

33:15.976 --> 33:20.269
They keep on threatening to fix it
but they never will.

33:31.240 --> 33:33.944
I sat right there on the bed.

33:43.459 --> 33:48.286
If I came to the diner with you,
would you bring me back?

33:48.422 --> 33:50.995
Of course I would.

33:56.429 --> 33:57.758
What are you staring at?

33:59.807 --> 34:01.183
Sorry.

34:01.309 --> 34:03.052
It's all right.

34:06.981 --> 34:10.016
It's just you suddenly reminded me of him.

34:10.150 --> 34:14.976
He was standing right where you are,
kind of breathless like you.

34:20.243 --> 34:22.994
I'll go and get my coat.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.862
I'll wait for you downstairs.

34:35.547 --> 34:38.217
I couldn't take another minute
of Los Angeles.

34:38.342 --> 34:43.335
I felt like I had to say sorry
in every street in the city.

34:48.768 --> 34:50.725
I'll tell you what.

34:50.853 --> 34:56.060
If I promise to stop being a cop,
will you stop being a witness?

34:56.192 --> 35:01.103
I don't have to ask all the questions.
You can ask too.

35:01.238 --> 35:03.444
- Are you wearing a uniform?
- No.

35:06.743 --> 35:09.993
I'm glad we got the conversational
side of lunch over.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.875
- Sorry, just I don't want to sit in
a middle of a restaurant. - Why?

35:15.300 --> 35:16.817
I feel like everyone's looking at me.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.385
Nobody's looking at you.
Hardly anyone's here.

35:20.130 --> 35:22.621
The only person looking at you is me.

35:26.261 --> 35:27.969
Are you married?

35:28.096 --> 35:31.215
Was. I don't like to talk about it.

35:31.349 --> 35:34.433
- You asked me to ask you questions.
- I know.

35:34.560 --> 35:38.723
Just you picked the one time
I like not to remember.

35:38.855 --> 35:44.229
I was in the badlands, Helena.
It happens to a lot of cops.

35:46.404 --> 35:49.274
We don't want to talk about that.

35:50.866 --> 35:54.317
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears. "

35:54.453 --> 35:57.204
Yeah, that'll do. Is that "Hamlet"?

35:57.331 --> 36:00.533
No, it's Wordsworth.

36:04.170 --> 36:06.577
Do you like poetry?

36:16.056 --> 36:18.594
Do you like poetry?

36:21.102 --> 36:24.103
I don't know. I haven't read much.

36:27.399 --> 36:30.186
I don't think poetry's my kind of thing.

36:32.571 --> 36:35.856
- But you pray.
- Pray?

36:35.991 --> 36:38.991
You said you were in the badlands.

36:40.453 --> 36:42.576
No, I don't pray.

36:42.705 --> 36:45.575
I had a dream once about God.

36:47.209 --> 36:52.713
It was just about the time I was getting
well, and he was a nasty looking guy.

36:52.839 --> 36:55.330
He moved into the apartment right above.

36:56.301 --> 37:00.761
And I said,
"Don't you listen to people's prayers?"

37:00.888 --> 37:02.928
He said, "Prayers?"

37:03.891 --> 37:07.094
"Not often. They're junk mail. "

37:09.396 --> 37:12.812
You're pushing too hard.
It's like you want me to say stop.

37:12.941 --> 37:18.480
You must know it's going that way.
We've got other cases so ease up a little.

37:18.613 --> 37:20.107
This is a major, chief.

37:20.239 --> 37:25.280
- We're closer than ever to this guy.
- So where's the body and why hide it?

37:25.410 --> 37:29.657
He hasn't. He never made a hit this far
north nor read a weather forecast.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.909
She's probably 15 feet from the highway,
three feet under snow.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.453
Got a match on the bullet?

37:34.585 --> 37:37.705
- Got a print from the hand?
- No, sir.

37:37.838 --> 37:41.254
It could be anyone's hand.
Illegally disposed of hospital debris.

37:41.383 --> 37:45.250
It's her hand and scars.
Her dog was shot and she's missing.

37:45.387 --> 37:49.135
She's not missing.
Did she scream? Did he coerce her?

37:49.265 --> 37:51.174
No. She left of her own free will.

37:52.032 --> 37:54.421
And if she gets on a plane
and goes to Peru with the prick,

37:54.771 --> 37:56.254
she's still not missing.

37:56.656 --> 37:59.742
I love to paint. It's not great art,
but I switched the colours.

38:00.442 --> 38:02.767
- If you're not going to hear me...
- I have heard you.

38:02.903 --> 38:05.310
You just don't like hearing me.

38:05.447 --> 38:08.578
You got this whole damn
thing out of proportion.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.464
I don't know what you've
got used to in Los Angeles,

38:11.702 --> 38:14.110
but I don't believe there's a police
chief in the country

38:14.246 --> 38:16.571
who would put together
a task force for a body part.

38:16.707 --> 38:18.367
We have multiple homicide.

38:18.500 --> 38:21.252
We have a body part
under suspicious circumstances.

38:21.378 --> 38:25.126
A tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere
and a bill for $17 for its wig.

38:33.472 --> 38:37.220
You know the great joy of fishing?
You don't have to think.

38:37.351 --> 38:40.766
Just you and the mackerel
and nothing in between but God.

38:40.896 --> 38:43.565
I'm thinking about
the old bum at the dump.

38:43.690 --> 38:48.185
Naturally, it's a beautiful day.
The sun's coming out. Barbecue chicken.

38:48.319 --> 38:51.770
- What else would you be thinking about?
- He was murdered.

38:51.906 --> 38:55.274
- He was also cremated.
- Tell me about it. I made a serious error.

38:55.409 --> 38:58.493
The guy who took him out
knew how to fake it.

38:58.620 --> 39:00.031
Here they come.

39:02.749 --> 39:06.117
Throw it high in the air.
There you go.

39:06.252 --> 39:08.079
Why is she blind?

39:09.088 --> 39:11.958
She had a car accident at 14.

39:12.674 --> 39:15.379
Her entire family was wiped out.

39:17.846 --> 39:20.087
No shit.

39:27.229 --> 39:29.637
Such a shame.
She's a really sweet kid.

39:29.773 --> 39:34.067
She's a doll,
but I wish he hadn't brought her out here.

39:35.570 --> 39:39.698
Rule one is,
don't diddle around with a witness.

39:39.824 --> 39:42.908
Except for the hair colour,
she looks just like Suzanne.

39:43.035 --> 39:45.952
Well, that's who she is.

39:46.080 --> 39:48.749
Except she can't run away.

39:49.791 --> 39:52.247
I really like Margie.

39:52.377 --> 39:54.950
She likes you.

39:55.088 --> 39:57.164
Have you known her long?

39:57.298 --> 40:00.133
She's my big little sister.

40:00.259 --> 40:02.501
She doesn't sound like you.

40:02.636 --> 40:05.044
She kind of adopted me.

40:06.056 --> 40:08.132
How come you never asked me
what I'm like?

40:08.266 --> 40:10.010
I know what you're like.

40:10.143 --> 40:12.930
How do you know what I'm like?

40:13.062 --> 40:17.439
- Ross told me.
- Oh yeah? What did he say?

40:17.567 --> 40:22.857
He said you were quite chubby
and you have a nervous tick.

40:22.988 --> 40:25.693
What else did he say?

40:25.824 --> 40:30.402
- Just your age.
- How old did he say I was?

40:30.537 --> 40:32.494
57.

40:33.998 --> 40:36.074
I don't mind.

40:47.719 --> 40:51.763
- What's the matter?
- That was like the hollow car.

40:51.889 --> 40:53.431
A Volkswagen van.

40:54.642 --> 40:56.302
Are you sure?

40:58.020 --> 41:00.261
Her dog was barking all the time.

41:00.397 --> 41:04.311
It didn't like him.
He said, "Put that thing in the back. "

41:04.442 --> 41:08.309
Then I heard a door slam,
and the van drove away.

41:09.238 --> 41:11.445
Why were you out here?

41:13.033 --> 41:16.568
Because I wanted to feel
the snow on my face.

41:19.831 --> 41:22.322
I love the snow and the rain.

42:29.645 --> 42:32.266
What are you doing, Mister?

42:34.274 --> 42:38.852
We're having a lot of vehicle robberies.
Your door was open.

42:39.904 --> 42:43.438
- Can I see your driver's licence?
- Yeah.

42:43.574 --> 42:46.528
I saw you leaving the Institute.
Do you go there a lot?

42:46.660 --> 42:48.736
That was you who nearly ran into me.

42:48.870 --> 42:53.117
No, you nearly ran into me.
Are you up there a lot?

42:53.249 --> 42:57.543
My mother and I run an arts centre
and buy stuff from the institutes.

42:57.670 --> 43:01.121
- Where's your store?
- Oakland.

43:01.257 --> 43:02.881
Oakland.

43:03.008 --> 43:07.966
Well, on your next stop,
make sure that door's locked.

43:08.096 --> 43:10.669
Merry Christmas.

43:10.807 --> 43:14.258
Miss Robertson may appear mature,

43:14.394 --> 43:17.180
but let me assure you, she isn't.

43:17.313 --> 43:19.389
Not even by her own perceptions.

43:19.523 --> 43:23.058
If she could look in a mirror,
she'd expect to see a child of 14.

43:24.486 --> 43:27.570
I don't wish to be indelicate,
Mr Citrine,

43:27.697 --> 43:31.232
but I think you understand
what I'm saying.

43:32.243 --> 43:36.371
Investigation of a possible homicide
is never easy.

43:36.497 --> 43:40.444
And I hope you're not suggesting
any impropriety on the part of my officer.

43:41.639 --> 43:43.416
Having said that,

43:43.818 --> 43:47.084
this department has no further
interest in Miss Robertson.

43:49.008 --> 43:51.250
Thank you for your cooperation.

43:51.385 --> 43:53.259
I appreciate it.

43:56.432 --> 43:59.551
Just hear me out.
I have a vehicle and a name.

43:59.685 --> 44:01.558
- What name?
- John.

44:01.686 --> 44:04.094
- What's the vehicle?
- A Volkswagen van.

44:04.230 --> 44:07.480
You'll be knocking
on doors all over the state.

44:07.608 --> 44:11.688
- Just give me a month.
- No. Finito, maestro. Closed.

44:11.821 --> 44:15.865
And this has nothing to do with him.
It was over anyway.

44:15.991 --> 44:19.157
I'm sorry.
I know this means something to you.

44:19.286 --> 44:23.864
I don't want you at that institute again.
I'm flat out about that.

44:25.333 --> 44:26.708
Here.

44:27.585 --> 44:29.661
Goodridge got it from Amber.

44:29.795 --> 44:32.547
It's a postcard.

44:32.673 --> 44:36.919
Apparently she's alive and well
and living in Oakland.

44:37.052 --> 44:41.760
- She's dead, chief.
- Then that's a very unique souvenir.

44:45.768 --> 44:47.345
Can I buy you a beer, sergeant?

44:47.478 --> 44:51.641
Don't try to ingratiate yourself with me,
Travis. But just this once I'll have a Mic.

44:51.773 --> 44:53.980
How are you doing?

44:54.109 --> 44:58.023
- Three Mics, Susie.
- A couple of shots.

45:02.116 --> 45:05.070
Look at those amazing bosoms.

45:06.203 --> 45:10.616
- Want another beer?
- No. Gotta go. I'm nights.

45:10.749 --> 45:13.703
- Give me a ride?
- Sure.

45:13.835 --> 45:16.326
How's that hand job coming along, John?

45:16.463 --> 45:18.621
We're not talking the "talk" tonight.

45:18.756 --> 45:20.998
No one's gonna make that dude.

45:21.300 --> 45:26.045
Six months investigation and the nearest
we got, we thought he was a sailor.

45:26.180 --> 45:28.386
- A sailor?
- Yeah.

45:28.515 --> 45:32.643
In and out of Frisco on the big boats.
Every lead pointed to the sea.

45:32.769 --> 45:34.560
Night Freddy T, John.

45:34.687 --> 45:36.810
How come he's suddenly
so forthcoming?

45:36.939 --> 45:40.059
- I'd kick him in the fucking ass.
- Stop it.

45:40.192 --> 45:44.439
If he'd told me, I might have got
somewhere. I never heard that theory.

45:44.571 --> 45:47.062
He might have
the one thing I need in his files.

45:47.199 --> 45:50.484
Have a fucking lemonade.
Let it go.

47:17.656 --> 47:19.981
What are you looking for?

47:21.242 --> 47:23.235
Vehicle references.

47:25.121 --> 47:26.615
Wrong cabinet.

47:26.747 --> 47:30.745
I have a link with a series in San Diego
and half a VW van.

47:30.876 --> 47:33.082
I thought you might
have the other piece.

47:34.004 --> 47:35.415
No.

47:36.715 --> 47:38.588
What's happening?

47:38.716 --> 47:42.215
Sergeant Berlin is doing
a little in-house investigation.

47:42.345 --> 47:46.971
- I wish you'd fucking shout at me.
- You got some kind of obsession?

47:47.099 --> 47:50.219
Do the job you're paid for.
There's work right up the corridor.

47:50.352 --> 47:53.306
If our stuff's too dull,
why don't you go back to L.A.?

47:53.438 --> 47:55.644
I'm gonna be here when Jennifer 8 shows.

47:55.774 --> 47:59.853
In spring she'll come through the snow.
Then I'll find her killer.

47:59.986 --> 48:01.528
Then I'll go back.

48:01.654 --> 48:05.865
When you finish in here,
I've got a report to type up.

48:08.410 --> 48:10.948
Maybe you'll let me know.

48:16.125 --> 48:20.205
You really are the working part
of an asshole, Berlin.

48:31.181 --> 48:33.422
I didn't intend to come today.

48:36.561 --> 48:38.470
I'm not supposed to be here.

48:40.523 --> 48:42.147
Why?

48:50.031 --> 48:52.024
It's in Braille.

48:54.243 --> 48:56.485
It's from Amber?

48:58.289 --> 48:59.913
It's dated a week ago.

49:01.667 --> 49:06.375
"Dear Mr Goodridge, I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

49:06.504 --> 49:08.663
"Just a line to say all is well.

49:09.632 --> 49:12.668
"I'm looking for a job
and an apartment.

49:13.636 --> 49:16.802
"Love to all who love me.
Amber. "

49:18.599 --> 49:21.718
- I don't think Amber wrote this.
- Why not?

49:21.852 --> 49:24.389
Amber wasn't very good at Braille.

49:24.521 --> 49:29.182
She couldn't have written it.
She couldn't even have read it.

52:57.380 --> 52:59.871
- You see this?
- What?

53:02.135 --> 53:04.460
You out of your mind with this?

53:04.595 --> 53:07.596
If anything happens to her,
I'll break your back.

53:07.723 --> 53:10.012
Easy on your words.

53:10.142 --> 53:11.684
What's going on?

53:11.810 --> 53:15.393
His blind friend got attacked.
Angelo went up there.

53:15.522 --> 53:18.606
- Somehow it got in the paper.
- You put it in.

53:18.733 --> 53:22.813
- I may have said something. I don't recall.
- Don't lie. I just spoke to Blattis.

53:22.945 --> 53:27.322
- You gave him the whole case.
- The case is closed. So what?

53:27.449 --> 53:30.284
You just hung a target
round her neck.

53:30.410 --> 53:31.655
Bullshit, pal.

53:31.787 --> 53:34.491
Don't you know?
He collects newspaper cuttings.

53:34.623 --> 53:38.786
Now he's reading Helena Robertson's
name like she's a witness.

53:38.918 --> 53:44.160
- You couldn't have been more stupid.
- Come on, let's all hear the expert.

53:44.298 --> 53:45.840
Just walk away from me.

53:45.966 --> 53:48.042
Think you're the only guy
who's worked homicide?

53:48.176 --> 53:51.296
I was a big city cop, too.
I busted the clock on "Jennifer".

53:51.429 --> 53:54.099
I know more about this man
than you'll ever know. It ain't him.

53:54.224 --> 53:57.390
- You're investigating a soap opera.
- Come on, stop.

53:57.518 --> 54:00.685
He says bye and she gets attacked.
Give me a break!

54:02.147 --> 54:07.438
There is no serial killer. Put her name
in neon and there still isn't one.

54:07.569 --> 54:10.605
Everybody here is saying it.
I mean everybody.

54:10.739 --> 54:13.988
- Shut up, King Jay.
- Let's have this out.

54:14.117 --> 54:16.358
You know what everyone thinks?

54:16.494 --> 54:19.827
You're making a case
because you found a nice piece of ass.

54:19.955 --> 54:23.490
No one's blaming you.
I hear she's worth the flowers.

54:23.625 --> 54:27.208
But don't come in here
getting holy over us.

54:28.713 --> 54:33.126
Yeah, I put it in the paper.
Because I wanted to stop this bullshit.

54:33.259 --> 54:36.710
- It's pissing everyone off.
- You don't know what you've done.

54:36.846 --> 54:42.551
If your friend from San Diego was here
and thought she was a danger to him,

54:42.684 --> 54:44.842
he would have taken her out weeks ago.

54:49.148 --> 54:52.066
Why don't you get a dictionary
and look up "witness"?

54:52.193 --> 54:54.731
- I know what a witness is.
- Yeah, well, her it ain't.

54:54.862 --> 54:57.566
That bitch is blind as a blind fucking...

54:57.698 --> 55:01.944
I'm gonna do something you never did.
I'm gonna catch this bastard.

55:02.077 --> 55:05.777
And when I do, he'll find out
how good a witness she really is.

55:06.831 --> 55:11.327
Meanwhile, you'd better be aware of me
because I wish you ill.

55:24.264 --> 55:29.174
I told you what would happen
and it's happened. "Goodbye, Princess. "

55:29.310 --> 55:33.438
And that same night she gets attacked.
That's a tough one to swallow.

55:33.564 --> 55:36.019
I am familiar with Taylor's opinion.

55:36.149 --> 55:40.610
- You don't really believe this?
- 100 fucking per cent I believe it.

55:40.737 --> 55:44.355
You know why?
Because I never said goodbye. OK?

55:44.490 --> 55:47.989
- Is that good enough for the committee?
- I didn't know that.

55:48.119 --> 55:49.743
No, you didn't know that.

55:53.832 --> 55:55.908
You left your booze in here.

55:59.087 --> 56:02.206
Who do you think it was?
You think it was him?

56:02.340 --> 56:05.127
- That is a very stupid question.
- I'm asking it.

56:05.259 --> 56:09.588
How the hell do I know who.
Some jerk-off. Some peeping tom prick.

56:09.721 --> 56:11.797
Definitely not him.
He's in the trade.

56:11.932 --> 56:15.632
He won't just look at her.
If he's in a room with her, she's dead.

56:15.769 --> 56:18.141
- Ease off.
- I'm sick of this toy town shit.

56:18.271 --> 56:20.809
What you're saying is reasonable,

56:20.940 --> 56:23.431
but there's a reasonable explanation
for the opposite.

56:23.567 --> 56:25.560
Don't give me another word of that.

56:25.694 --> 56:30.071
There is a bad man out there.
He may be in the next room or next state.

56:30.198 --> 56:34.065
I don't know what trigger's him,
but if he reads her name in the paper,

56:34.202 --> 56:36.657
I think he'll do something about it.

56:37.538 --> 56:41.702
I got a bad feeling about this. And I've
been doing this too long to be wrong.

57:02.936 --> 57:05.225
I don't want you to worry, OK?

57:05.355 --> 57:08.806
We're going to find this guy,
and everything will be OK.

57:09.567 --> 57:12.485
- OK?
- OK.

57:13.946 --> 57:16.354
You want your music on?

57:20.577 --> 57:23.115
You're looking worried again, Helena.

57:23.246 --> 57:24.824
No, I'm not.

57:24.956 --> 57:28.823
You look more worried now
than when you decided to stop worrying.

57:30.545 --> 57:33.415
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

57:34.215 --> 57:38.129
I'm going to roast you a chicken
with candles around it.

57:39.219 --> 57:41.792
Wouldn't it be better if I cook it?

57:43.348 --> 57:45.471
You said, you can only boil.

01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:11.272
From Helena.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.058
Sounds like Frank Sinatra.

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:18.645
- Where are the ladies?
- Putting on the war paint.

01:00:19.656 --> 01:00:21.530
I can't thank you enough.

01:00:21.658 --> 01:00:24.825
Don't thank me, thank Margie.
It's her invitation.

01:00:24.953 --> 01:00:27.657
And where Citrine is concerned,
we'll keep it that way.

01:00:27.789 --> 01:00:31.157
- Got ya.
- Chivas Regal.

01:00:31.292 --> 01:00:32.667
Gentlemen...

01:00:37.256 --> 01:00:40.091
Gentlemen, Merry Christmas.

01:00:41.718 --> 01:00:45.134
Now, turn around.
Let's see the whole thing. Go on.

01:00:46.514 --> 01:00:48.803
You look so pretty.

01:00:49.267 --> 01:00:52.101
Once a year. Christmas.

01:00:52.228 --> 01:00:56.059
What do you think?
Not too much, just right?

01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:59.807
She looks so pretty.
Well, say something, guys.

01:01:27.301 --> 01:01:28.629
What?

01:01:31.096 --> 01:01:34.180
I got you. Hold my beer, sweetie.

01:01:34.307 --> 01:01:35.636
Careful.

01:01:36.977 --> 01:01:39.183
Where the hell have you been?

01:01:39.312 --> 01:01:42.016
The duty sergeant fucked up.
I'm on tonight.

01:01:42.148 --> 01:01:44.983
- How long have you got?
- One big drink.

01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:46.936
- John, did you get my message?
- No.

01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:50.901
I left a message on your machine.
It wasn't me calling. Is my wife around?

01:01:51.031 --> 01:01:54.447
Kitchen. We got a so-called
professional cook out there,

01:01:54.576 --> 01:01:57.031
having a nervous breakdown
over a turkey.

01:01:57.161 --> 01:01:58.656
Sure you didn't call?

01:01:58.788 --> 01:02:01.824
I spoke to what's-his-name
but never asked for her.

01:02:01.957 --> 01:02:03.202
Her who?

01:02:03.334 --> 01:02:07.165
Someone's been calling the Institute
wanting to ask Helena more questions.

01:02:07.296 --> 01:02:08.671
Not guilty.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.749
Thanks, Angelo.

01:02:12.217 --> 01:02:13.841
You got a quiet phone?

01:02:13.968 --> 01:02:16.175
Don't start getting antsy
over this.

01:02:16.304 --> 01:02:19.507
- It's probably some local cops.
- It's what I want to find out.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.803
Upstairs.

01:02:24.353 --> 01:02:27.519
Beautiful. There. Good.

01:02:27.647 --> 01:02:30.518
- Are you sure I look OK?
- Are you kidding?

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:34.066
You are the prettiest girl
here by 200 per cent.

01:02:34.195 --> 01:02:36.104
Press your lips together.

01:02:36.239 --> 01:02:38.943
There. Good. OK, sit down.

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:44.741
- How are you doing on those heels?
- They don't mix very well with beer.

01:02:50.376 --> 01:02:52.914
When did John divorce?

01:02:53.045 --> 01:02:55.252
Two or three years ago.

01:02:56.799 --> 01:03:00.333
- What was she like?
- She was very pretty.

01:03:00.469 --> 01:03:05.261
But a policeman's wife she wasn't.
So one day she just packed and left.

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:08.841
And his whole life
went straight down the nearest toilet.

01:03:08.977 --> 01:03:12.511
- What does that mean?
- It means, he crashed, you know?

01:03:12.647 --> 01:03:15.564
He just couldn't come to terms with it.

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:20.020
Every spare minute he ran down to
San Diego, having a terrible time with her,

01:03:20.153 --> 01:03:25.609
getting drunk, coming back... You wouldn't
believe the amount that man drank.

01:03:25.742 --> 01:03:29.988
- You think he still loves her?
- I think he still thinks about her.

01:03:30.121 --> 01:03:31.781
Not like then.

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:35.115
Then it was an obsession.

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:36.828
Yes, come in.

01:03:37.252 --> 01:03:41.629
That woman in the kitchen says, if she
doesn't get help, she's going to resign.

01:03:41.756 --> 01:03:44.543
That woman, she's a disaster.

01:03:44.676 --> 01:03:47.213
OK, tell her I'll be right there.
No, wait a minute.

01:03:47.345 --> 01:03:52.302
Take Helena with you and find John.
Don't let go of her hand until you do. Good.

01:04:07.822 --> 01:04:11.025
I'll just see if he's upstairs.
You stay right here.

01:04:16.413 --> 01:04:20.196
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

01:04:25.588 --> 01:04:28.921
- Hey, Popeye!
- Hey, Fat Guy!

01:04:29.049 --> 01:04:33.177
You are still
the prettiest goddamn cop in this town.

01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:07.208
It's me, John.

01:05:23.056 --> 01:05:26.591
Do you want me
to bring Margie back up here?

01:05:26.726 --> 01:05:29.098
Take me home, please.

01:05:38.988 --> 01:05:42.072
I just can't walk in these shoes.

01:05:46.578 --> 01:05:49.151
You don't have to dress like this for me.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:28.701
You can't get in there.

01:07:28.837 --> 01:07:30.462
Jesus!

01:07:31.465 --> 01:07:35.213
- What are you doing?
- I suppose I'm drinking myself sober.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:45.517
- You got any Glasers?
- Yeah. Right drawer. Left drawer.

01:07:45.644 --> 01:07:47.435
- 32s?
- Right drawer.

01:07:52.192 --> 01:07:55.856
- What exactly are you doing?
- I'm going to the Institute.

01:07:55.987 --> 01:07:57.018
Now?

01:07:59.699 --> 01:08:03.910
This "cop" that's been calling thinks
she'll be there over Christmas.

01:08:04.036 --> 01:08:07.404
I checked with the locals
and our station. No calls.

01:08:08.665 --> 01:08:11.831
So whoever it is, it isn't the police.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.533
This bastard's
getting worried about something.

01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:17.587
I think there's a chance he might turn up.

01:08:17.715 --> 01:08:19.921
Well, let's hope he does.

01:08:25.721 --> 01:08:27.798
And if he does,

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.386
I'm gonna drop a bomb on the fucker.

01:08:32.603 --> 01:08:33.765
Listen.

01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:36.687
You don't have to come.

01:08:36.814 --> 01:08:40.859
Hey, watch 'em working.
I'm your partner.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:05.044
What time is it?

01:09:11.721 --> 01:09:13.715
Where's your watch?

01:09:17.144 --> 01:09:19.469
I guess it's by the bed.

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:25.522
It's 2:40.

01:09:29.363 --> 01:09:32.279
Isn't she a little young for you, bro?

01:09:35.827 --> 01:09:41.069
Do you think if she could see, she'd
hang around with an old dog like you?

01:09:41.291 --> 01:09:44.790
Your stomach's going round
to meet itself behind your back.

01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:46.496
Bullshit.

01:09:48.005 --> 01:09:51.953
- I'm in my prime, baby.
- Bits. Bits.

01:09:53.468 --> 01:09:55.342
What do you mean?

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:58.340
Policemen's bodies age at different rates.

01:09:58.473 --> 01:10:04.178
Look at me. My belly's in its 50s, my balls
are in their 60s, and my feet in their 80s.

01:10:04.854 --> 01:10:06.929
Hit those wipers.

01:10:10.942 --> 01:10:13.516
There. See it?

01:10:18.157 --> 01:10:20.944
- See it, fourth floor?
- Yeah.

01:10:21.077 --> 01:10:23.199
He's fucking in there.

01:10:23.329 --> 01:10:25.736
Let's do it.

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:30.409
- What channel?
- Local.

01:10:30.544 --> 01:10:33.034
Local? What if we need back up?

01:10:33.171 --> 01:10:35.876
We're not here.
I don't want the desk to hear us.

01:10:36.007 --> 01:10:38.961
- You only got that. 32?
- And my Beretta.

01:10:51.396 --> 01:10:53.602
This fucking thing's quitting.

01:10:58.944 --> 01:11:02.395
- I'll start at the top.
- You ain't going alone.

01:11:02.531 --> 01:11:04.903
That is a liability.
I don't want you hanging on my shirt.

01:11:05.033 --> 01:11:09.611
If anybody comes down, take him out.
I want this bastard living!

01:11:24.593 --> 01:11:26.799
- Ross.
- 10-2.

01:11:26.928 --> 01:11:30.712
- I'm going in.
- You take care, bro.

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:08.207
- Ross, you hear me?
- 10-2.

01:12:09.342 --> 01:12:10.586
I'm going upstairs.

01:13:15.401 --> 01:13:17.892
John, what's happening?

01:13:19.572 --> 01:13:23.735
I'm on Helena's floor
to take a look at her apartment.

01:13:25.869 --> 01:13:27.529
Are you OK?

01:13:28.413 --> 01:13:30.821
My flashlight's kaput.

01:13:34.294 --> 01:13:36.251
The door's locked.

01:13:40.966 --> 01:13:43.457
What's happening, brother?

01:13:45.095 --> 01:13:48.179
I hear something. Something upstairs.

01:13:49.432 --> 01:13:51.223
I've got footsteps above me.

01:13:59.733 --> 01:14:01.975
John, what's happening?

01:14:03.779 --> 01:14:07.610
- You are now on the third floor.
- Shit!

01:14:09.993 --> 01:14:12.448
The fucker's in the elevator.

01:14:19.334 --> 01:14:23.035
Get ready, Ross.
He may be coming down.

01:16:00.384 --> 01:16:01.843
John?

01:16:03.053 --> 01:16:05.260
Can you hear me?

01:16:05.389 --> 01:16:08.804
Can you hear me? Let's go.
Can you hear me?

01:16:14.647 --> 01:16:15.845
Can you hear me?

01:16:16.941 --> 01:16:18.352
Can you hear me?

01:16:18.484 --> 01:16:20.856
Just be careful because I'm coming up.

01:16:24.948 --> 01:16:26.407
Is that you, John?

01:16:32.747 --> 01:16:33.910
John?

01:16:36.834 --> 01:16:41.377
Answer me. Now! Or I'll blow
this fucking staircase to pieces.

01:16:42.339 --> 01:16:44.415
It's me, Freddy.

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:50.426
What the hell is going on up there?
I've been calling ten minutes.

01:16:50.555 --> 01:16:53.840
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

01:16:53.975 --> 01:16:56.014
What the fuck are you doing?

01:16:57.811 --> 01:17:02.473
Holy shit, John.
John, not you! Not you!

01:17:44.729 --> 01:17:46.852
Get me the police. Quickly!

01:18:47.953 --> 01:18:49.328
Where's Margie?

01:18:52.832 --> 01:18:55.074
Taking Bobby to her friend's.

01:18:55.209 --> 01:18:58.661
Thinks his dad's in the hospitaI.

01:19:00.464 --> 01:19:02.872
Why did you go up there, John?

01:19:19.023 --> 01:19:20.303
John?

01:19:34.829 --> 01:19:36.537
Right here.

01:19:57.599 --> 01:19:59.592
Is that Margie?

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:02.219
I'm here, darling.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.516
I'm right here.

01:20:15.616 --> 01:20:17.941
Don't cry, darling.

01:20:18.076 --> 01:20:20.199
He was a big old cop.
He didn't like tears.

01:20:20.328 --> 01:20:22.404
- Margie...
- Don't.

01:20:26.959 --> 01:20:27.990
Don't.

01:20:36.968 --> 01:20:39.720
What are you going to do
about this, little brother?

01:20:45.017 --> 01:20:46.974
I don't know, Margie.

01:20:47.103 --> 01:20:49.178
I don't know.

01:20:54.484 --> 01:20:57.983
I'm tired now.
I'm going to go to sleep.

01:21:04.452 --> 01:21:08.200
Let me go. Let me go.

01:21:09.289 --> 01:21:11.911
Let me go. Let me go.

01:21:20.216 --> 01:21:23.086
I want 24-hour protection
on Margie's house.

01:21:24.303 --> 01:21:27.090
Otherwise I'm not saying nothing.

01:21:27.222 --> 01:21:30.638
You give me that,
or read my rights and talk to a lawyer.

01:21:30.767 --> 01:21:33.305
All right. You got it.

01:21:33.436 --> 01:21:36.307
I'm going to put an observer
in there with you.

01:21:36.439 --> 01:21:39.190
- I don't trust the F.B.I.
- I want Serato.

01:21:39.317 --> 01:21:41.938
- No.
- Why can't I have Serato?

01:21:43.737 --> 01:21:45.943
Because I'm short of men.

01:21:47.282 --> 01:21:48.907
And Angelo won't do it.

01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:53.492
Whoever I got free first, you get.

01:21:58.209 --> 01:22:01.328
I always figured I'd like to retire
to a little town like this.

01:22:01.462 --> 01:22:04.498
Maybe buy a boat, do some fishing.

01:22:04.631 --> 01:22:06.754
You fish, John?

01:22:07.467 --> 01:22:09.792
I have done some.

01:22:09.928 --> 01:22:12.964
All right, let's not beat around the bush,

01:22:13.097 --> 01:22:16.596
whatever that might mean,
and get right down to it.

01:22:18.894 --> 01:22:23.639
You don't mind if I jump around a bit
while I'm easing my way into this, do you?

01:22:23.774 --> 01:22:27.438
- You're asking the questions.
- You had an argument with Ross?

01:22:27.569 --> 01:22:32.147
- Assaulted one of the officers?
- I wouldn't use the word assault.

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:35.567
- You got a racy temper?
- Not especially.

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:38.274
Just something they did
made you lose your rag?

01:22:38.412 --> 01:22:43.654
Not they. He. Taylor put a piece in the
paper, which put my witness in jeopardy.

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.749
From whom?

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:48.909
From the man I detailed in my report.

01:22:50.256 --> 01:22:55.250
He's a crazy man. And to my certain
knowledge has killed eight girls.

01:22:57.429 --> 01:23:00.134
Not a lot of support
for that scenario, though.

01:23:00.265 --> 01:23:02.304
No. Not a lot.

01:23:02.434 --> 01:23:04.260
Not even from Ross?

01:23:07.522 --> 01:23:08.553
No.

01:23:09.231 --> 01:23:12.102
Is that why you lost your temper with him?

01:23:13.736 --> 01:23:18.278
Frustration. No one believing you.
Is that why you were angry with Taylor?

01:23:21.409 --> 01:23:24.612
- You don't like Sergeant Taylor, do you?
- Like?

01:23:24.746 --> 01:23:28.446
- You want to use another word?
- I'm indifferent to him.

01:23:28.582 --> 01:23:32.283
You don't blame him
for the situation you're in?

01:23:32.419 --> 01:23:37.128
His motive for exposing my witness
was malicious.

01:23:38.133 --> 01:23:41.501
- So you don't like him?
- No, I don't like him.

01:23:43.596 --> 01:23:45.055
You...

01:23:47.474 --> 01:23:48.803
...wish him ill?

01:23:55.190 --> 01:24:00.184
This crazy man, what makes you think
he wants to eliminate Miss Robertson?

01:24:01.946 --> 01:24:06.074
- Did you read my report, sir?
- I'm asking a question.

01:24:08.118 --> 01:24:13.278
He reads the newspaper. I'm
investigating her friend's disappearance

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:16.748
and Miss Robertson becomes
the focus of his anxiety.

01:24:16.876 --> 01:24:18.915
How good a witness is she?

01:24:19.045 --> 01:24:21.832
He's a crazy man, but he ain't stupid.

01:24:21.964 --> 01:24:25.297
He's got a flexible modus operandi
and doesn't want to get caught.

01:24:25.426 --> 01:24:30.383
We'll have plenty of time to discuss
your mystery man and his flexibility later.

01:24:30.514 --> 01:24:33.218
Right now I'd like to talk about the event.

01:24:39.313 --> 01:24:41.519
Can you turn that thing on?

01:24:41.649 --> 01:24:45.598
All right, the door comes back,
hits you, knocks you out.

01:24:45.736 --> 01:24:49.567
For how long do you figure,
approximately?

01:24:49.698 --> 01:24:53.362
One minute? Ten?

01:24:53.493 --> 01:24:57.572
OK. Then what happened?
Immediately you got up?

01:24:57.705 --> 01:25:00.705
I saw a flashlight
at the bottom of the stairs.

01:25:00.833 --> 01:25:02.635
Did you check your weapon?

01:25:03.906 --> 01:25:07.281
Maybe.
It would have been instinctive.

01:25:07.605 --> 01:25:11.714
- All I know is I was in possession of it.
- You didn't check it?

01:25:11.843 --> 01:25:15.092
- I don't know. I didn't think of it.
- Why not?

01:25:15.221 --> 01:25:18.636
- I was dazed.
- You were confused?

01:25:18.766 --> 01:25:22.810
- I was unconscious ten seconds ago.
- I understand.

01:25:23.854 --> 01:25:25.312
Then?

01:25:29.317 --> 01:25:32.567
Then I grabbed the flashlight.
I tried to get Ross on the radio.

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:34.983
There was nothing. Static.

01:25:37.366 --> 01:25:39.904
I noticed blood on my hand.

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:45.368
- My eye was cut.
- Could you see out of it?

01:25:45.498 --> 01:25:47.906
Yeah, I could see.

01:25:50.419 --> 01:25:53.788
I climbed out of the window,
and went down the fire escape.

01:25:53.922 --> 01:25:57.505
When I got to the bottom, I found Ross.

01:25:58.844 --> 01:26:01.761
- Were you breathless?
- Sure I was breathless.

01:26:02.764 --> 01:26:06.844
When did you realise you were
no longer in possession of the. 32?

01:26:08.519 --> 01:26:10.511
In the hospital.

01:26:10.646 --> 01:26:14.857
You figured you lost it
in the hospital or on the way there?

01:26:14.983 --> 01:26:17.854
I figured it had fallen down the stairwell.

01:26:17.986 --> 01:26:21.152
- Like the flashlight?
- Yes.

01:26:27.536 --> 01:26:30.490
Were you drinking that night?

01:26:36.503 --> 01:26:38.994
- It was Christmas Eve.
- That wasn't my question.

01:26:39.130 --> 01:26:41.799
- Yes.
- What about Ross?

01:26:41.924 --> 01:26:47.428
Were you drinking in the car?
You had a bottle in the car?

01:26:47.554 --> 01:26:51.172
- I think Ross had a mouthful.
- But not you?

01:26:51.308 --> 01:26:55.685
- I may have had a nip.
- To keep out the cold.

01:26:55.812 --> 01:26:59.761
It was very cold that night.
Wasn't it very windy?

01:27:05.863 --> 01:27:09.730
- Which hand was the flashlight in?
- Left hand.

01:27:11.076 --> 01:27:13.697
So the Walther was in the right?

01:27:15.538 --> 01:27:18.290
- The Beretta was in the right.
- You said you didn't check.

01:27:18.416 --> 01:27:21.085
So how do you know which gun you had?

01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:24.661
You said you thought it had
gone downstairs with the flashlight,

01:27:24.797 --> 01:27:29.956
which you picked up in confusion. How do
you know you didn't pick up the. 32?

01:27:30.093 --> 01:27:33.129
- Are you playing games with me?
- Games?

01:27:33.263 --> 01:27:35.255
I told you I lost the Walther.

01:27:35.389 --> 01:27:38.972
You said you didn't know
until you were in the hospital.

01:27:39.101 --> 01:27:41.557
So it could have been either weapon.

01:27:41.687 --> 01:27:45.138
The gun in my right hand was a Beretta.

01:27:45.273 --> 01:27:48.808
And I'd like that note corrected
for the record. Now, please sir...

01:27:49.944 --> 01:27:52.945
- Do you want a lawyer?
- Another game question.

01:27:53.072 --> 01:27:56.655
What do I want a lawyer for?
I got nothing to hide.

01:27:56.784 --> 01:28:00.449
- Don't you?
- You know I don't. So quit the bullshit.

01:28:00.579 --> 01:28:02.951
Get down to it.
What's your angle?

01:28:12.757 --> 01:28:14.500
Where is that little gun?

01:28:14.633 --> 01:28:17.124
- I have no idea.
- You don't?

01:28:17.261 --> 01:28:20.427
If it isn't at the Institute,
the man who killed Ross took it.

01:28:20.555 --> 01:28:23.426
The man who killed Ross used it.

01:28:26.519 --> 01:28:31.560
And you don't have any idea where
that little. 32 calibre Walther's gone?

01:28:36.695 --> 01:28:37.940
No.

01:28:59.966 --> 01:29:01.626
All right, here it is.

01:29:01.759 --> 01:29:06.468
I intend to prove you shot
Frederick Ross with malice aforethought.

01:29:06.597 --> 01:29:11.389
Therefore, I will be preparing
a case on behalf of your chief

01:29:11.518 --> 01:29:14.602
to prosecute you for first degree murder.

01:29:20.693 --> 01:29:24.311
Dad! I want my dad!

01:29:24.447 --> 01:29:27.317
I hate her! I hate her!

01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:05.774
Could I have a number of a taxi, please?

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:10.609
There was a gale that night.
All the doors were swinging.

01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:15.733
So this door comes back,
clips you, and down you go.

01:30:15.868 --> 01:30:20.446
Within 35 seconds of unconsciousness,
you were on the fire escape.

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:22.657
And you're really confused.

01:30:22.791 --> 01:30:26.539
You don't know if Tuesdays come in twos
or happen once a week.

01:30:26.670 --> 01:30:29.161
You see a figure coming up the stairs.

01:30:29.297 --> 01:30:33.508
Ross isn't meant to be on the stairs.
He challenges you.

01:30:34.468 --> 01:30:37.138
And this ain't a piece of wood
with a nail through it.

01:30:37.263 --> 01:30:41.390
This guy's got a 12-gauge Winchester
up your nose, and he's drunk.

01:30:41.517 --> 01:30:44.553
You're dizzy, and your eye's full of blood.

01:30:44.686 --> 01:30:47.521
You ain't thinking good,
and you're seeing worse.

01:30:47.647 --> 01:30:51.727
And... wow... it just went off.

01:30:52.735 --> 01:30:55.938
You just put him down.

01:30:57.614 --> 01:31:00.983
And you get hit by a Glaser,
you stay down.

01:31:01.827 --> 01:31:07.496
But he ain't dead.
Now you realise, you shot your partner.

01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:13.378
"Oh, Suzanna,
how am I going to get out of this one?"

01:31:16.924 --> 01:31:18.466
I know.

01:31:18.592 --> 01:31:22.257
Serial killer shot him.

01:31:26.933 --> 01:31:28.972
And now...

01:31:30.227 --> 01:31:32.801
...here comes the malice, bro.

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:41.312
17 seconds later,
you put another one in his throat.

01:31:43.573 --> 01:31:45.814
Isn't that what happened?

01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:47.195
No.

01:31:48.327 --> 01:31:49.987
Tell me what happened then.

01:32:47.089 --> 01:32:49.414
Let me ask you a question,
before I forget.

01:32:49.549 --> 01:32:52.218
- Do you take medication for that?
- For what?

01:32:52.343 --> 01:32:55.178
- Breathlessness.
- No.

01:33:01.852 --> 01:33:05.802
Let me answer your question:
"What is the relevance of the janitor?"

01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:16.778
Why don't I take you through it
from where I'm sitting?

01:33:16.907 --> 01:33:19.908
At some time between 2:00 and 2:30,

01:33:20.035 --> 01:33:24.163
the janitor thought he heard
a vehicle approaching through the woods.

01:33:24.289 --> 01:33:28.417
He looks out, sees nothing.
No lights, nothing.

01:33:30.253 --> 01:33:32.494
He figures it must be hunters.

01:33:32.630 --> 01:33:35.833
Some time later, he hears a noise.

01:33:35.966 --> 01:33:39.050
A door. Maybe a window slam.

01:33:39.178 --> 01:33:44.420
He gets up, and between 2:30 and 2:45

01:33:44.558 --> 01:33:49.717
he makes a search with a flashlight
of the top three floors.

01:33:51.272 --> 01:33:56.017
Finding nothing untoward,
he goes back to his apartment on the roof.

01:33:56.151 --> 01:33:59.686
The flashlight you saw was his.

01:33:59.821 --> 01:34:03.237
The footsteps you heard were his.

01:34:03.366 --> 01:34:07.031
The elevator you were chasing
up and down was empty.

01:34:07.161 --> 01:34:12.202
It's prone to such activity
due to an electrical fault.

01:34:12.333 --> 01:34:16.033
Apparently it happens
frequently during gales.

01:34:16.169 --> 01:34:19.004
The gale that was swinging the door,

01:34:19.131 --> 01:34:23.424
knocked you down
and confused you so much.

01:34:23.551 --> 01:34:27.134
And so here we are
back to where I'm sitting.

01:34:29.432 --> 01:34:33.096
Why don't you tell me
what really went on that night?

01:34:35.854 --> 01:34:39.187
There are two men
that know I didn't kill him.

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:43.609
One is me,
and the other is the man that did.

01:34:43.736 --> 01:34:45.880
Which man is this?

01:34:47.728 --> 01:34:49.893
We just dealt with the man.

01:35:38.995 --> 01:35:40.868
John, is that you?

01:37:07.575 --> 01:37:10.659
You got really fucking lucky,
didn't you?

01:37:14.998 --> 01:37:16.872
Feel my face.

01:37:25.675 --> 01:37:29.209
I was starting to get
kind of concerned about you, Jenny.

01:37:30.554 --> 01:37:34.386
Like, how blind are you?

01:37:34.516 --> 01:37:37.552
As blind as your friend,

01:37:37.686 --> 01:37:41.469
or less blind,
because she could see, you know.

01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:44.772
She had a view out of one of them.

01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:47.228
But you...

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:50.730
you don't see nothing, do you?

01:37:50.864 --> 01:37:52.857
Nothing at all.

01:37:52.991 --> 01:37:57.866
But let me tell you, little Jenny.
If he ever gets to me, you're dead.

01:37:57.996 --> 01:37:59.573
That's a promise.

01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:05.833
Get St. Anne in here
for a minute, will you?

01:38:05.961 --> 01:38:10.706
Give him this.
Our blind lady has been attacked again.

01:38:10.841 --> 01:38:13.129
She's in love with him.
She'll try anything.

01:38:13.259 --> 01:38:14.718
Yeah.

01:38:15.178 --> 01:38:17.669
I hear I've been nominated
as an official observer.

01:38:17.805 --> 01:38:20.343
- It's either you or Taylor.
- He don't want to do it either.

01:38:20.474 --> 01:38:23.345
I'll toss a coin,
but one of you is going in there today.

01:38:23.477 --> 01:38:26.229
Bullshit or not,
you should get a proper statement.

01:38:26.355 --> 01:38:30.897
That's been done.
What do you want to do with it?

01:38:33.736 --> 01:38:35.230
Let him have it.

01:38:58.842 --> 01:39:01.416
I need a friend, Angelo.

01:39:01.553 --> 01:39:03.510
You got one.

01:39:09.394 --> 01:39:11.600
She's a bad witness, John.

01:39:11.729 --> 01:39:13.935
And a fucking lousy alibi.

01:39:27.785 --> 01:39:31.617
I know why you did it, Helena,
but you're not helping me.

01:39:32.581 --> 01:39:35.499
Everything they are hearing from me
they think is a lie.

01:39:36.168 --> 01:39:40.117
Here comes the man
who I'm desperate to prove exists

01:39:40.255 --> 01:39:44.418
and what do you know,
he turns up at my house to chat with you!

01:39:44.551 --> 01:39:49.295
Nobody in California is going
to believe that. No one believes me.

01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:53.510
- I don't believe me.
- Don't you dare say that! I believe you.

01:39:53.642 --> 01:39:58.434
- You just don't understand.
- Then explain it to me.

01:39:58.563 --> 01:40:01.350
I've got enough darkness, haven't I?

01:40:02.859 --> 01:40:06.228
The man who killed Amber
is a psychopath.

01:40:06.362 --> 01:40:08.438
He was in the Institute to kill you.

01:40:08.572 --> 01:40:12.735
He didn't want to kill Ross,
he was there to kill you. That's the truth.

01:40:12.868 --> 01:40:16.652
That's why I wanted you to stay
in Margie's house.

01:40:16.788 --> 01:40:19.540
I can no longer protect you here.

01:40:21.584 --> 01:40:24.371
- Why me?
- He thinks you're a witness.

01:40:24.503 --> 01:40:27.290
- Then why didn't he kill me?
- Stop it, please.

01:40:27.423 --> 01:40:32.001
- Why didn't he kill me, John?
- Stop that! I'm not Serato, Helena!

01:40:40.643 --> 01:40:43.181
He didn't kill you
because he wasn't here.

01:40:43.312 --> 01:40:46.432
He won't stay in the same room
with you and let you live.

01:40:46.565 --> 01:40:48.973
Kiss me, John.

01:40:57.742 --> 01:40:59.865
Kiss me again.

01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:09.334
I love you.
Are my lips lying to you?

01:41:09.461 --> 01:41:11.868
Is my mouth lying to you?

01:41:15.633 --> 01:41:17.341
He was here.

01:41:22.681 --> 01:41:24.887
I've been calling ten minutes.

01:41:25.017 --> 01:41:27.887
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

01:41:28.019 --> 01:41:31.768
What the fuck are you doing?

01:41:31.898 --> 01:41:35.101
Holy shit, John!
John, not you!

01:41:45.327 --> 01:41:50.913
Ross switched in to channel 8, so we
have a recording of the whole incident.

01:41:53.584 --> 01:41:57.913
John, I could help you.
Why don't you tell me the truth?

01:41:58.047 --> 01:41:59.375
I have.

01:42:00.716 --> 01:42:04.049
That isn't me.
I've never called Ross "Freddy".

01:42:04.177 --> 01:42:06.846
- I've heard you call him "Freddy".
- No you haven't.

01:42:06.971 --> 01:42:09.545
You have no voice in here,
so keep your mouth shut.

01:42:09.682 --> 01:42:14.225
You tell a lot of lies. Is it something
that comes naturally to you?

01:42:14.353 --> 01:42:18.101
- I don't lie.
- You'd lie to your chief?

01:42:18.232 --> 01:42:24.150
- Under exceptional circumstances.
- What caused you to lie to Freddy Ross?

01:42:24.279 --> 01:42:26.022
I've never lied to Ross.

01:42:26.155 --> 01:42:27.815
- You didn't?
- No.

01:42:28.908 --> 01:42:31.280
Well, he thought you did.

01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:34.411
He even wrote it down here in his book.

01:42:36.123 --> 01:42:38.614
"Berlin is a liar. "
It's underlined.

01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:43.791
It's dated the day you got your first break
with your mystery man.

01:42:43.922 --> 01:42:46.958
You don't know why he wrote that, do you?

01:42:50.678 --> 01:42:53.678
Maybe he thought
there was no mystery man.

01:42:53.805 --> 01:42:56.890
Maybe he thought
your investigation was bullshit.

01:42:57.017 --> 01:43:02.390
Maybe he thought you were making it up
because you wanted to be top cop.

01:43:03.648 --> 01:43:07.313
Isn't that why
you ran up that garbage dump -

01:43:07.443 --> 01:43:11.025
so everyone could stand in awe of top cop!

01:43:13.907 --> 01:43:17.323
You came up here
cos you couldn't make it in LA.

01:43:17.452 --> 01:43:21.995
You got a pissy little degree
and came here to be top guy. Right?

01:43:22.123 --> 01:43:27.330
But Ross was top guy, wasn't he?
Always would be top guy.

01:43:27.461 --> 01:43:30.082
And he did it without even trying!

01:43:30.213 --> 01:43:32.502
Everybody loved him.

01:43:32.632 --> 01:43:35.467
He had everything you wanted, didn't he?

01:43:35.593 --> 01:43:39.757
Great marriage. Great kid.
Everything that you couldn't have.

01:43:39.889 --> 01:43:42.676
And you wanted it all to go away.

01:43:43.517 --> 01:43:46.304
Cos you had a lousy life

01:43:46.437 --> 01:43:50.979
with a lousy wife
who was fucking everyone.

01:43:51.107 --> 01:43:52.934
Wasn't she?

01:43:53.068 --> 01:43:57.314
Is that why you needed
to pick on this little blind girl?

01:43:57.447 --> 01:44:01.491
Cos you could control her.
Control who she's fucking...

01:44:04.286 --> 01:44:05.665
Come on, John.

01:44:06.592 --> 01:44:10.979
Lose your temper with me.
You're good at losing your temper.

01:44:11.014 --> 01:44:16.290
- Come on, lose your temper with me.
- No way, Mr St. Anne.

01:44:18.799 --> 01:44:22.168
But you lost your temper with Ross,
didn't you?

01:44:22.302 --> 01:44:25.089
Why don't you tell me the truth?

01:44:26.223 --> 01:44:29.342
You got into an argument in the car.

01:44:29.476 --> 01:44:32.393
You lost your temper with him.

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:37.431
You stood over him and blew
his fucking larynx out with a Glaser!

01:44:37.566 --> 01:44:41.065
Where were you aiming, John?
Going for the face?

01:44:41.195 --> 01:44:45.406
You wanted to blow his fucking face away
because you hated him so much?

01:44:45.532 --> 01:44:49.743
No, I love that guy. It's tough knowing
that he thought I killed him.

01:44:49.869 --> 01:44:53.949
Well, that he did.
And that do I, sergeant.

01:45:07.719 --> 01:45:10.672
What do you take
for that breathlessness?

01:45:10.805 --> 01:45:14.672
- I don't take anything.
- How about Aminophylline?

01:45:16.685 --> 01:45:19.602
- I don't know what that is.
- You don't?

01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:22.137
It's an anti-asthma medication...

01:45:22.273 --> 01:45:24.681
...prescribed for breathlessness.

01:45:25.610 --> 01:45:28.397
It came out of the ashtray of your car.

01:45:29.572 --> 01:45:31.944
But you don't know what it is.

01:45:32.074 --> 01:45:37.697
You know how it got there?
You don't use it for breathlessness?

01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:46.795
John, I'm running out of questions...

01:45:46.921 --> 01:45:49.625
and you're running out of lies.

01:45:49.757 --> 01:45:52.960
You've one more chance
to take that second degree.

01:46:12.402 --> 01:46:15.522
- I'm gonna need some time to think.
- All right.

01:46:15.655 --> 01:46:19.071
You think about it.
But don't make a fool of me.

01:46:19.742 --> 01:46:25.198
You come back with another lie,
I'll press for the maximum penalty there is.

01:46:25.831 --> 01:46:27.954
That's the death penalty.

01:46:30.919 --> 01:46:33.125
Come on, get your things. Let's go.

01:46:33.254 --> 01:46:35.745
The man who murdered Ross
gets asthma.

01:46:35.882 --> 01:46:39.962
It's not breath freshener,
it's an asthma inhaler.

01:46:40.094 --> 01:46:44.720
This capsule came out of the van.
This guy drove that van.

01:46:44.848 --> 01:46:47.553
- OK. Oakland. What?
- Arts and Crafts.

01:46:47.684 --> 01:46:50.257
Dan. Yeah. Here.

01:46:51.521 --> 01:46:53.430
You sure?

01:46:53.565 --> 01:46:57.064
- No Amanda with a VW.
- Arts and Crafts.

01:46:57.193 --> 01:46:58.735
I gotta find that store.

01:47:09.496 --> 01:47:12.366
If you find him,
call me with his name.

01:51:53.044 --> 01:51:55.915
The time is 9:00 pm.

01:53:59.117 --> 01:54:02.782
You should not have come
to my mother's house.

01:54:04.205 --> 01:54:07.787
Police spent several hours this morning
at Sergeant Berlin's home.

01:54:07.917 --> 01:54:11.617
Various property was removed
including a. 32 calibre Walther pistol -

01:54:11.753 --> 01:54:15.965
the weapon believed to have been used
in the slaying of Sergeant Ross.

01:54:16.091 --> 01:54:19.008
I'm unable to say anything right now

01:54:19.135 --> 01:54:22.171
except this is a very sad and tragic day.

01:54:22.305 --> 01:54:27.974
John Berlin lied to me and, much worse,
he lied to everyone in this community.

01:54:28.102 --> 01:54:31.720
- Where was Sergeant Berlin arrested?
- At his home. 6:00 am.

01:54:31.855 --> 01:54:34.856
- Who arrested him?
- Sergeant Taylor.

01:54:34.983 --> 01:54:38.019
- Did he resist arrest?
- I've nothing to add.

01:54:38.152 --> 01:54:41.568
He did not arrest me in my house!

01:54:41.697 --> 01:54:45.148
He hit on me in Oakland.

01:54:45.284 --> 01:54:47.857
I'll sign anything you want. Anything!

01:54:47.995 --> 01:54:52.039
I just want an opportunity
to talk to her and Margie, that's all.

01:54:52.165 --> 01:54:54.870
That's my deal, chief.

01:54:55.001 --> 01:54:58.915
- All right, I'll put it to St. Anne.
- Be quick, or she's dead.

01:54:59.046 --> 01:55:02.332
He didn't push her down the stairs
when they met, did he?

01:55:02.466 --> 01:55:06.166
He went up there to plant the fucking gun!

01:55:09.014 --> 01:55:12.382
Open the door, Travis!

01:56:18.076 --> 01:56:20.484
- Margie?
- It's Sergeant Taylor.

01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:24.949
I'm sorry, Margie.
I've been trying to call. Your line's down.

01:56:25.083 --> 01:56:27.870
We're taking the guard off today.

01:56:32.006 --> 01:56:35.006
Is she going somewhere?

01:56:35.884 --> 01:56:38.754
You're not going to try
and bail him, are you?

01:56:38.887 --> 01:56:42.137
I really wouldn't do that, Margie.
We found the gun.

01:56:43.975 --> 01:56:45.884
I know.

01:56:54.359 --> 01:56:58.226
Do you want me to drive her?
I'm through with my shift.

01:56:58.363 --> 01:57:01.032
No. I'm going to take her.

01:57:06.370 --> 01:57:09.205
I've got your suitcase.

01:57:10.958 --> 01:57:13.283
Here's my arm.

01:57:23.219 --> 01:57:28.509
Taylor was a cop in San Diego.
He comes up here, hits another girl,

01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:32.305
then spends months
feeding false information into "Jennifer".

01:57:32.894 --> 01:57:36.726
Let me tell you about this sick man
named John Taylor.

01:57:36.856 --> 01:57:40.059
He grows up
in an environment of blind children.

01:57:40.192 --> 01:57:45.862
His mother is blind, she teaches the blind
and he has classes with blind girls.

01:57:45.989 --> 01:57:50.698
He's a boy, so he's attracted to them.
But every time he smiles at them...

01:57:50.827 --> 01:57:53.532
He really don't like you, JK!

01:57:53.663 --> 01:57:58.538
...they reject him
and his fantasies develop into a rage.

01:57:59.668 --> 01:58:03.832
He's gonna dig himself in some bullshit
with this bullshit.

01:58:03.964 --> 01:58:08.791
Therefore he hates them. What is he
going to do with those lousy bitches?

01:58:09.427 --> 01:58:12.547
He's a little boy.
He turns them into little dolls...

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:16.594
He tears their heads and hands off
and puts them on his face.

01:58:16.726 --> 01:58:18.967
He really didn't like me!

01:58:21.230 --> 01:58:23.306
- He's out.
- What?

01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:25.064
Margie just made his bail.

01:58:42.207 --> 01:58:45.789
There's no one here.
Mom took her back to the Institute.

01:58:45.919 --> 01:58:48.706
- What? When?
- I don't know.

01:58:48.838 --> 01:58:51.080
How come they let you out?

01:58:52.049 --> 01:58:54.374
Is Margie with her?

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:58.840
- Is she with her?
- No. She came back and went out again.

01:58:58.972 --> 01:59:01.510
They're all out around here.

01:59:33.962 --> 01:59:37.461
He'd have to be real crazy to kill her now.

01:59:37.591 --> 01:59:41.670
I mean, we're talking
real full-blown insane.

01:59:41.803 --> 01:59:47.223
He is insane. His brain's upside-down,
but he's very cunning.

01:59:47.349 --> 01:59:51.477
He won't go after her with a. 45 Colt,
he'll just push her down the stairs.

02:01:17.765 --> 02:01:20.302
Say night-night, dead girl.

02:01:54.506 --> 02:01:56.499
Is it dark yet?

02:01:56.633 --> 02:01:59.919
No. But it's getting kinda red.

02:02:04.015 --> 02:02:06.091
I remember red.
