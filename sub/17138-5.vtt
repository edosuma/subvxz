WEBVTT

00:01.163 --> 00:03.452
Time travel is real, and all of history

00:03.454 --> 00:05.148
is vulnerable to attack which is why

00:05.150 --> 00:07.108
we must travel through
time to stop the spread

00:07.110 --> 00:08.783
of these so-called time aberrations

00:08.785 --> 00:10.785
and to erase their damage to history.

00:10.787 --> 00:13.955
We are a team of outcasts and misfits,

00:13.957 --> 00:16.091
so please don't call us heroes.

00:16.093 --> 00:18.654
We're something else, we're legends.

00:19.689 --> 00:21.830
Previously, on “Legends of Tomorrow”...

00:21.832 --> 00:23.532
I'd forgotten how handsome I was.

00:23.534 --> 00:26.067
- Hi, I'm Marty.
- Have a wonderful life, Martin.

00:26.069 --> 00:28.370
This belonged to the
greatest outsider I ever knew.

00:28.372 --> 00:30.438
I'm looking for a partner.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.140
Hello, Rex.

00:32.142 --> 00:33.542
With his last words,

00:33.544 --> 00:35.544
he told me his killer
was a time traveler.

00:35.546 --> 00:37.379
Damien Darhk murdered my sister.

00:37.381 --> 00:38.580
If I take him out here...

00:38.582 --> 00:40.312
You save her. We gotta let him go.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:53.664 --> 00:55.630
So it's all here, then?

00:55.632 --> 00:57.933
Every sweet-smelling speck of it.

00:59.736 --> 01:01.870
As for my compensation?

01:03.340 --> 01:04.940
Strange form of payment.

01:07.144 --> 01:09.344
Why this and not cash?

01:09.346 --> 01:13.348
Everyone has a hobby.
Some men collect stamps.

01:13.350 --> 01:14.950
I collect relics.

01:14.952 --> 01:19.421
This "thing" is called a fasces,
a ceremonial axe

01:19.423 --> 01:21.423
carried by the bodyguard of Emperor Nero

01:21.425 --> 01:24.359
from which a term "fascism" derived.

01:24.361 --> 01:26.561
No? A form of rule,

01:26.563 --> 01:29.164
which, in my opinion,
is getting a bit of a bad rap lately.

01:29.166 --> 01:31.800
DEA! Get your hands in the air, now!

01:45.449 --> 01:47.048
You know, I had this under control.

01:47.050 --> 01:48.350
My way's faster.

01:48.352 --> 01:49.851
Speed isn't everything, Mr. Thawne.

01:49.853 --> 01:51.853
You should've learned that lesson by now.

01:51.855 --> 01:55.457
What's it been... 45 years since
you hired me to nuke New York?

01:55.459 --> 01:57.993
Well, 45 years for you,
maybe, but for me?

01:57.995 --> 01:59.261
Huh.

01:59.263 --> 02:00.729
Good seeing you again, old friend.

02:00.731 --> 02:03.298
Old? That's fair. Friend?

02:03.323 --> 02:05.224
Now that's something
that has to be earned.

02:05.249 --> 02:06.712
Lovely piece. What is this?

02:06.737 --> 02:09.003
First century AD, if I'm not mistaken?

02:09.006 --> 02:11.106
What is it that you want?

02:11.108 --> 02:13.308
A partner.

02:13.310 --> 02:15.210
Pass... I prefer to work alone.

02:15.212 --> 02:17.746
Oh, yeah, gathering
your hive of followers,

02:17.748 --> 02:20.915
building your empire, designing your ark.

02:20.917 --> 02:23.218
Yeah, I know what you're planning.

02:23.220 --> 02:25.020
And how it works out.

02:25.022 --> 02:28.890
You want to reshape the world?
Try reshaping history.

02:28.892 --> 02:30.558
Try rewriting destiny...

02:30.560 --> 02:33.161
Try putting our partnership
into concrete terms,

02:33.163 --> 02:36.731
as in, what's in it for me?

02:36.733 --> 02:39.768
Well, perhaps content
collecting symbols of power,

02:39.770 --> 02:44.506
but... I can give you actual power.

02:46.301 --> 02:51.277
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:51.829 --> 02:53.845
We have the tools to make a difference.

02:53.847 --> 02:55.279
We can make history better.

02:55.281 --> 02:57.949
Even if we act with
the best of intentions,

02:57.951 --> 03:00.118
these changes can
ripple throughout time...

03:00.120 --> 03:03.521
A temporal domino effect
with disastrous consequences.

03:03.523 --> 03:06.557
So we start small.
Make changes we can control.

03:06.559 --> 03:08.459
What you're talking about can't be done.

03:08.461 --> 03:10.338
It's... it's like playing God,
and it goes against everything

03:10.362 --> 03:11.282
we're trying to do.

03:11.307 --> 03:13.398
I thought we were trying to help people.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.366
We're helping by fixing aberrations,

03:15.368 --> 03:17.268
not creating them. You're not thinking

03:17.270 --> 03:18.536
fourth dimensionally.

03:18.538 --> 03:20.861
Did you really just use Doc Brown on me?

03:20.886 --> 03:23.476
Who the hell is that?

03:23.478 --> 03:27.080
Sarah, come on, you can't
be Switzerland on this one.

03:28.617 --> 03:32.185
In my heart, I agree with you...

03:32.187 --> 03:35.855
but that's not what Rip
entrusted us to do.

03:35.857 --> 03:38.157
Our job is to protect history.

03:38.159 --> 03:40.460
You mean clean it up after somebody else

03:40.462 --> 03:44.230
makes a mess of it. Time janitors...

03:44.232 --> 03:46.266
That's all we are.

03:53.575 --> 03:55.775
Easy, point and shoot.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.176
You're up.

03:57.178 --> 03:59.546
All right, point and shoot.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.320
You killed my beers.

04:07.345 --> 04:09.563
Come on, the trigger's really sensitive,

04:09.588 --> 04:12.692
and these goggles make
everything look blue.

04:12.694 --> 04:16.329
You know, it'd be really easy

04:16.331 --> 04:18.064
for me to improve this
whole setup by just

04:18.065 --> 04:19.365
iterating the power source.

04:19.367 --> 04:21.534
There's nothing wrong with the gun.

04:21.536 --> 04:25.338
You've just gotta be cool. Like Snart.

04:25.340 --> 04:28.608
Yeah, I can be cool.

04:32.180 --> 04:35.281
- What are you doing?
- Trying to be cool.

04:35.283 --> 04:37.350
Maybe this was a bad idea.

04:37.352 --> 04:39.886
You know, this may shock you,

04:39.888 --> 04:41.888
but I was considered
extremely cool when I left

04:41.890 --> 04:44.257
my cushy six-figure Silicon Valley job

04:44.259 --> 04:48.528
and started my own tech company.
Ladies were lining up.

04:48.530 --> 04:50.897
Listen, Haircut, if you want to fit

04:50.899 --> 04:54.901
into Snart's shoes, you gotta
find the pain, the darkness,

04:54.903 --> 04:59.105
the anger. You got it in you?

05:00.375 --> 05:03.176
Call me Haircut again and I'll ice you.

05:04.813 --> 05:06.579
Not bad.

05:09.784 --> 05:12.085
Hey, what are you doing?

05:12.087 --> 05:14.320
A little side project
I've been working on

05:14.322 --> 05:16.155
with Ray and the professor.

05:17.292 --> 05:19.325
Hmm. It said that

05:19.327 --> 05:22.929
temporal aberrations cause
these things called timequakes.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.897
So I started thinking, if there was a way

05:24.899 --> 05:28.501
of locating their epicenters,
maybe we'll be able to fix

05:28.503 --> 05:30.236
the aberrations before they happen.

05:30.238 --> 05:33.039
- Like a time seismograph.
- That's an awesome name,

05:33.041 --> 05:36.009
and I'm totally gonna steal that.

05:36.011 --> 05:39.245
If the JSA could get
even a glimpse of all this,

05:39.247 --> 05:40.947
- they would...
- They'd what?

05:43.151 --> 05:44.717
Never mind.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.320
Hey, wait. We've barely had

05:47.322 --> 05:49.622
half a conversation since
you came on board,

05:49.624 --> 05:51.791
and you were friends with my grandfather.

05:51.793 --> 05:54.460
Talk to me. What was he like as a person?

05:54.462 --> 05:58.331
Your grandfather was a great man.

05:58.333 --> 06:00.733
That's it? He's a great man?

06:00.735 --> 06:02.702
Is it because your
missions were classified,

06:02.704 --> 06:04.237
or is it because you
really didn't know him

06:04.239 --> 06:05.705
- well as a person?
- It's because the JSA

06:05.707 --> 06:08.274
didn't encourage its
members to fraternize.

06:08.276 --> 06:10.209
Something you and your
team should consider.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.848
It worked?

06:20.155 --> 06:21.554
Oh, it worked all right.

06:21.556 --> 06:23.389
Where's it coming from?

06:23.391 --> 06:26.526
Washington D.C., December 7, 1987.

06:26.528 --> 06:28.961
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

06:28.963 --> 06:30.563
- So?
- Dude, that's the White House.

06:30.565 --> 06:31.583
So what?

06:31.608 --> 06:34.200
December 7th was the day
before Reagan and Gorbachev

06:34.202 --> 06:36.502
signed the INF Treaty,
reducing both countries'

06:36.504 --> 06:38.337
nuclear arsenals and
paving the way for the end

06:38.339 --> 06:40.136
- of the Cold War.
- How do you know all that?

06:40.160 --> 06:42.442
Because I was in the
capital for that very summit.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.210
The Reagan Administration
would call upon the top

06:44.212 --> 06:46.846
nuclear physicists to act
as technical advisors.

06:46.848 --> 06:48.481
You think someone might
have traveled back in time

06:48.483 --> 06:50.149
to stop the treaty from being signed?

06:50.151 --> 06:52.385
That, or worse. Think about it,

06:52.387 --> 06:54.320
Reagan and Gorbachev under the same roof

06:54.322 --> 06:56.389
at one of the most volatile
moments in history?

06:56.391 --> 06:58.758
The JSA has a training academy in D.C.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.460
I could reach out to
the current membership,

07:00.462 --> 07:03.730
see if they have any intel
or resources we could use.

07:03.732 --> 07:05.898
Good idea, but you shouldn't go alone.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.801
1987 is a long way from 1942,
and it's dangerous to know

07:08.803 --> 07:10.269
too much about the future.

07:10.271 --> 07:12.038
- I can handle myself.
- I'll go with her.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.274
Great, you two reach out to
the JSA while the rest of us

07:15.276 --> 07:18.111
break into the most secure
residence in the country.

07:18.113 --> 07:20.713
And how exactly do we do that?

07:20.715 --> 07:23.649
Welcome to the White House.
This is Cross Hall,

07:23.651 --> 07:27.053
a magnificent space that
connects the State Dining Room

07:27.055 --> 07:28.354
with the East Room.

07:28.356 --> 07:30.223
All right, fan out, stay on the coms,

07:30.225 --> 07:32.992
and report if anything
seems out of place.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.464
Women actually wore these
things in the '80s?

07:38.466 --> 07:40.299
Shoulder pads? Yeah,
they were supposed to

07:40.301 --> 07:42.735
make women more imposing,
more, I don't know...

07:42.737 --> 07:44.604
- Manly?
- Yeah.

07:44.606 --> 07:46.806
I'd hoped that by this decade,
women wouldn't need to use

07:46.808 --> 07:49.008
clothing to compensate for their status.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.111
Surely by now men and women
are considered equals.

07:52.113 --> 07:53.980
Never lose that optimism.

07:53.982 --> 07:56.082
This is it.

07:56.084 --> 07:58.718
This is the JSA Academy?

07:58.720 --> 08:01.254
Inside a crummy warehouse?

08:01.256 --> 08:04.857
The JSA Academy is hidden
inside a crummy warehouse.

08:06.661 --> 08:08.761
Prepare to see the most
elite training facility

08:08.763 --> 08:10.530
in all of history.

08:17.672 --> 08:20.807
Maybe "elite" means
something different in 1987.

08:32.020 --> 08:33.285
When I was recruited,

08:33.288 --> 08:35.221
this is where I was brought to train.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.390
What happened to the JSA?

08:38.393 --> 08:40.860
No clue...

08:40.861 --> 08:42.861
but a lot can change in 45 years.

08:42.864 --> 08:44.964
I thought you said you were a historian.

08:44.966 --> 08:46.265
How can you not know?

08:46.267 --> 08:49.402
Hey, every memo, every executive action

08:49.404 --> 08:52.371
relating to the JSA is top secret.

08:52.373 --> 08:54.941
I only pieced together their
World War II activities

08:54.943 --> 08:57.109
from my father's bedtime stories,

08:57.111 --> 09:00.880
witness testimonies,
and government leaks.

09:12.660 --> 09:15.528
I never should have left 1942.

09:17.665 --> 09:21.234
Look, Amaya, whatever
happened to them, that's...

09:21.236 --> 09:23.603
That's not your fault.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.338
You don't know that.

09:27.642 --> 09:30.543
Like you said, you don't know
what happened to them.

09:41.020 --> 09:44.688
1987... the halcyon days
of Whitney Houston

09:44.690 --> 09:46.557
and "Star Trek: The Next Generation."

09:46.559 --> 09:49.626
I can remember this year
as if it were yesterday.

09:49.628 --> 09:51.728
Well, it looks like there's
something you forgot about.

09:51.730 --> 09:54.164
Mr. Stein, so nice to meet you.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.466
Uh-oh...

09:56.468 --> 09:57.768
That's me.

09:58.571 --> 09:59.937
Go, go.

10:04.710 --> 10:06.176
I thought you said you
were stuck in meetings

10:06.178 --> 10:07.711
- on the Hill all day.
- I was.

10:07.713 --> 10:10.180
I never stepped foot
inside the White House.

10:10.182 --> 10:12.749
The aberration must've
caused infinitesimal ripples

10:12.751 --> 10:14.952
that affected the movements
of my younger self.

10:14.954 --> 10:17.821
The temporal domino effect...
This is why we should

10:17.823 --> 10:19.756
never interfere with history.

10:19.758 --> 10:21.425
Well, we'll agree to disagree.

10:21.427 --> 10:23.727
But one thing's for sure,
we cannot let him see you.

10:23.729 --> 10:25.596
Indeed, the last time he and I interacted

10:25.598 --> 10:27.764
nearly erased our
marriage from existence.

10:31.470 --> 10:33.770
Those are jelly beans.

10:33.772 --> 10:35.105
I can see that.

10:35.107 --> 10:36.573
President Reagan's jelly beans.

10:36.575 --> 10:38.575
So what? Eat 'em.

10:38.577 --> 10:39.676
What? I'm pretty sure

10:39.678 --> 10:40.978
that's against the rules.

10:40.980 --> 10:42.913
We don't follow rules, remember?

10:42.915 --> 10:45.716
Oh, right.

10:50.489 --> 10:51.688
Hah.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.160
Reagan wasn't even one of my
top three favorite presidents.

10:57.162 --> 10:59.863
- Want some?
- Yeah.

10:59.865 --> 11:01.732
Oh, it'll take some massaging,
but I believe we can get

11:01.734 --> 11:04.067
the Soviets to agree to
eliminating all nuclear

11:04.069 --> 11:06.069
ground-launched, ballistic,
and cruise missiles.

11:06.071 --> 11:07.804
I'll even make them
believe it was their idea.

11:07.806 --> 11:09.439
I don't know what we'd do
without you, Mr. Darhk.

11:09.441 --> 11:11.608
Oh, you'd manage,
but winning is always better.

11:17.616 --> 11:19.716
I think we found our aberration.

11:19.718 --> 11:20.851
Our next stop is the...

11:20.853 --> 11:22.252
Damien Darhk is here.

11:22.254 --> 11:25.589
Sara, don't do anything rash.

11:25.591 --> 11:27.157
Sara? Sara, are you lis...

11:28.761 --> 11:31.395
Here's another diplomatic cable from 1956

11:31.397 --> 11:33.997
fromfrhe British ambassador
warning the JSA about

11:33.999 --> 11:35.966
Soviet spies in their midst.

11:35.968 --> 11:38.135
I thought fighting
Hitler would unite the U.S.

11:38.137 --> 11:39.736
and the Soviet Union.

11:39.738 --> 11:43.340
Oh, we have so much Cold War
history to catch you up on.

11:46.345 --> 11:48.211
Okay, what's this?

12:02.828 --> 12:05.896
Aah!

12:05.898 --> 12:07.572
Todd?

12:07.597 --> 12:10.333
Why? Why did you abandon us?

12:15.541 --> 12:16.940
Who is that?

12:16.942 --> 12:19.142
It's Obsidian.

12:19.144 --> 12:21.111
From the JSA?

12:22.548 --> 12:23.880
Ohh.

12:23.882 --> 12:27.651
Soviets to agree to...

12:33.358 --> 12:36.259
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
you to drop the weapon.

12:36.261 --> 12:38.895
Drop the knife and place
your hands behind your head.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.688
We've got a situation in the East Wing.

12:42.472 --> 12:45.053
I know you want vengeance for
Laura, but it's not that simple.

12:45.078 --> 12:46.803
Get out of the way.

12:46.805 --> 12:48.638
- Don't move!
- Stay where you are!

12:48.640 --> 12:51.141
- Damn it.
- We gonna fight or leave?

12:51.143 --> 12:52.709
Fight.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.447
All right, get out of here. I got this.

12:57.449 --> 12:58.782
No, you go. I got this.

12:58.784 --> 13:00.584
I said go!

13:06.959 --> 13:10.727
What did I say about crossing streams?

13:10.729 --> 13:12.229
You said we don't follow the rules.

13:12.231 --> 13:15.665
That's the one rule...
One rule we follow!

13:16.735 --> 13:18.935
Go!

13:44.165 --> 13:46.632
We interrupt this broadcast
with breaking news:

13:46.634 --> 13:49.468
Chaos in the capital.
Just a day before

13:49.470 --> 13:52.138
President Reagan is set to
welcome General Secretary

13:52.140 --> 13:55.508
Gorbachev to the White House
to sign the INF Treaty,

13:55.510 --> 13:59.078
a White House tour ends in
violence and what witnesses

13:59.080 --> 14:03.783
describe as "a rocket man."
Was this an act of terrorism...

14:03.785 --> 14:06.552
Please, turn it off, Gideon.
I can't bear it.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.689
So your thirst for
vengeance nearly landed

14:09.691 --> 14:11.624
the entire team in prison.

14:11.626 --> 14:13.593
I guess it's only okay to change history

14:13.595 --> 14:15.928
if it's with your personal vendetta.

14:15.930 --> 14:20.233
Wasn't all Blondie's fault.
Haircut screwed up as well.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.534
Wha... If you would just

14:21.536 --> 14:22.868
let me tinker with the cold gun,

14:22.870 --> 14:24.503
I told you I could figure out the whole

14:24.505 --> 14:25.905
crossing the streams problem.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.541
There's nothing wrong with the cold gun.

14:28.543 --> 14:30.810
It's you, you goof.

14:30.812 --> 14:32.078
The bigger question is:

14:32.080 --> 14:33.846
Why did Damien Darhk become an advisor

14:33.848 --> 14:35.815
to Reagan's White House on
the eve of a nuclear treaty

14:35.817 --> 14:37.116
with the USSR?

14:37.118 --> 14:39.252
If his involvement with the Nazis in 1942

14:39.254 --> 14:42.054
is any indication, he's working with

14:42.056 --> 14:43.723
our time traveling nemesis.

14:43.725 --> 14:46.092
It's the same person who killed Hourman.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.627
Amaya needs to hear about this.

14:47.629 --> 14:49.929
So she can also lose focus,

14:49.931 --> 14:53.933
risking everything in a
selfish pursuit of revenge?

14:53.935 --> 14:55.935
Do you have something you'd
like to say to me, Martin?

14:55.937 --> 14:59.038
Yes, that killing Damien
Darhk almost 30 years

14:59.040 --> 15:02.875
before his actual death will
have countless unforeseeable

15:02.877 --> 15:06.746
effects on the history that we
are charged with protecting.

15:06.748 --> 15:09.915
Well, what about protecting my sister?

15:09.917 --> 15:12.852
She brought me back from the dead.

15:12.854 --> 15:15.921
She risked everything for me.

15:15.923 --> 15:19.191
How could I not do the same for her?

15:19.193 --> 15:22.228
Because you answer to
a higher calling, Sara.

15:22.230 --> 15:27.166
I'm sorry, but we cannot stray
from our guiding principle.

15:27.168 --> 15:29.402
Well, I'm sorry, too.

15:29.404 --> 15:32.238
It sounds like you've never
really cared about anyone.

15:36.511 --> 15:38.544
Do you think I killed him?

15:38.546 --> 15:39.945
I hope I didn't kill him.

15:39.947 --> 15:42.948
He's gotta be in his late 70s at least!

15:42.950 --> 15:45.184
Maybe he couldn't take the hit.

15:45.186 --> 15:48.175
Oh, my God, I just killed a
member of the Justice Society.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.655
Why are you whispering?

15:49.657 --> 15:52.458
In case he's not dead,
he could probably use the nap.

15:52.460 --> 15:55.061
I'm not an invalid...

15:55.063 --> 15:57.830
Just old.

15:57.832 --> 16:01.300
And you, you haven't aged a day.

16:01.302 --> 16:03.669
It's one of the few
benefits of time travel.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.939
So you left us to join
the loveable losers.

16:06.941 --> 16:08.941
I was trying to find Rex's killer.

16:08.943 --> 16:10.943
And you never thought to tell me?

16:11.746 --> 16:13.813
I found Rex dying.

16:13.815 --> 16:15.915
His last words were "time traveler."

16:15.917 --> 16:18.584
I didn't think. I just acted.

16:18.586 --> 16:21.053
What happened to them, Todd?

16:21.055 --> 16:24.857
After the war, our friendship
with the Soviet Union ended,

16:24.859 --> 16:28.227
and we continued fighting
as what was known as

16:28.229 --> 16:32.098
the "Iron Curtain" descended
over central and eastern Europe.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.567
Does "we" include my grandfather?

16:34.569 --> 16:36.068
Right to the end.

16:36.070 --> 16:39.038
In 1956, President Eisenhower

16:39.040 --> 16:42.174
sent a team on a mission to Leipzig.

16:42.176 --> 16:44.643
They never made it back.

16:44.645 --> 16:46.479
Why didn't you go?

16:46.481 --> 16:48.748
'56 was a charged time.

16:48.750 --> 16:52.318
They were concerned that
I couldn't be trusted.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.388
- Why not?
- Leave it be, Nathaniel.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.957
Nate, Amaya, report
back to the Waverider.

17:00.027 --> 17:03.162
I promise you, Todd, I will fix this.

17:03.164 --> 17:04.763
What's done is done, Amaya.

17:04.766 --> 17:08.000
Not when you have a time machine.

17:08.002 --> 17:11.103
I'm sorry for leaving, Todd.

17:11.105 --> 17:13.439
I truly am.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.747
Rex's killer is here? In 1987?

17:21.749 --> 17:24.416
Potentially, if Damien Darhk
is still working with him.

17:24.419 --> 17:27.386
No way, Damien Darhk
joined the Reagan Administration

17:27.387 --> 17:29.455
as an advisor at the Reykjavík Summit?

17:29.457 --> 17:31.023
And after the collapse of the summit,

17:31.025 --> 17:34.093
Darhk was credited with
reviving the disarmament talks?

17:34.095 --> 17:37.329
Darhk prefers stockpiling nukes,
not getting rid of them.

17:37.331 --> 17:39.231
The nuclear treaty must be a cover.

17:39.256 --> 17:40.258
For what purpose?

17:40.283 --> 17:41.539
That's what we need to find out.

17:41.563 --> 17:43.536
Gideon, where is Damien Darhk now?

17:43.538 --> 17:45.337
I'm accessing the
calendar on his secretary's

17:45.339 --> 17:47.106
IBM personal computer.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.975
Mr. Darhk has a meeting in
Georgetown Park at 8:00 p.m.

17:49.977 --> 17:52.244
Late night meeting in the park,
that's not suspicious.

17:52.246 --> 17:54.146
Ray, take Mick. Find out who Darhk

17:54.148 --> 17:56.315
is meeting with and why.

17:57.652 --> 17:59.885
Wait, just us?

17:59.887 --> 18:02.721
Look, it's not a good idea

18:02.723 --> 18:05.524
for me to be anywhere near
Damien Darhk right now.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.994
I... I agree.

18:14.402 --> 18:17.369
Okay, we're a go on audio.

18:17.371 --> 18:19.171
Cutting it close, haircut.

18:21.742 --> 18:23.509
That's Snart's jacket.

18:23.511 --> 18:26.011
I... thought it would help
me get into character.

18:26.013 --> 18:28.647
- I'm Colonel Cold.
- The hell you are.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.617
You're not gonna give yourself a promotion.

18:31.619 --> 18:32.785
Fine.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.689
What are you doing?

18:36.691 --> 18:38.290
Well, we're on a stake-out.

18:38.292 --> 18:40.159
Brought snacks.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.360
Apple slice?

18:43.931 --> 18:46.866
Guess you're still upset
about the White House.

18:46.868 --> 18:49.301
Look, I can be more careful.
I can be more meticulous,

18:49.303 --> 18:50.636
more like Snart.

18:50.638 --> 18:52.404
I don't want you to be like Snart.

18:52.406 --> 18:54.073
What?

18:54.075 --> 18:55.608
You gave me his gun. You told me I had to

18:55.610 --> 18:56.609
try to fill his shoes.

18:56.611 --> 18:59.812
I was wrong.

18:59.814 --> 19:04.750
You keep reminding me of my...
my dead friend.

19:04.752 --> 19:08.954
It's bringing up... It's bringing up f...

19:08.956 --> 19:11.190
- Feelings?
- Yes.

19:11.192 --> 19:14.560
So just stop and be you.

19:14.562 --> 19:16.428
Well, that's a little difficult,

19:16.430 --> 19:20.399
considering I lost my suit,
my company, my powers.

19:20.401 --> 19:22.401
Is this what an existential
crisis feels like?

19:22.403 --> 19:25.838
Shut up. Just... shut up.

19:32.580 --> 19:34.713
I hate the '80s!

19:34.715 --> 19:36.615
Is there any sign of
who Darhk's meeting with?

19:36.617 --> 19:37.917
Not yet!

19:37.919 --> 19:39.685
Clandestine meeting in a D.C. park.

19:39.687 --> 19:42.755
It feels like the beginning
of a John le Carré spy novel.

19:42.757 --> 19:44.456
I'm more of an Ian Fleming guy.

19:44.458 --> 19:47.226
Mm, more explosions, less clothing.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.261
What if Darhk is
meeting with Rex's killer?

19:49.263 --> 19:51.564
Then we don't let either of them leave.

19:51.566 --> 19:52.965
We've got movement.

19:52.967 --> 19:54.266
A man just entered the park.

19:56.304 --> 19:57.469
Ray, we need audio.

19:57.471 --> 19:59.805
Yep, way ahead of you, Cap.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.574
Thankfully, there was
a Tech Village nearby.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.475
You wouldn't believe what
you can hack together

20:03.477 --> 20:05.277
with a few household items.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.548
Dobriy Vecher, Mr. Darhk.

20:09.550 --> 20:11.350
Sounds like he's meeting with a member of

20:11.352 --> 20:14.253
the Soviet delegation, not Rex's killer.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.021
The package is procured.

20:17.325 --> 20:19.625
Excellent news, Boris.

20:19.627 --> 20:23.028
That is your name, isn't it?
Boris? Or is it Igor?

20:23.030 --> 20:25.831
I find it's always one or the
other with you KGB agents.

20:25.833 --> 20:29.168
Anywho, once the treaty is signed,

20:29.170 --> 20:33.272
during the State Dinner,
you'll deliver the package.

20:33.274 --> 20:36.642
And you will uphold
your half of the bargain?

20:36.644 --> 20:38.143
As agreed.

20:38.145 --> 20:41.347
But first, a toast.

20:41.349 --> 20:44.016
To peace between our two nations.

20:44.018 --> 20:46.218
Darhk was never interested
in the nuclear treaty.

20:46.220 --> 20:49.121
He's working a side deal with the KGB.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.423
Uh-oh. Mayday!

20:51.448 --> 20:55.027
My... My name is Martin Stein.
You must have heard of me.

20:55.029 --> 20:57.196
You may have heard of me.

20:57.198 --> 20:59.365
Marty, younger you just entered the park.

20:59.367 --> 21:01.200
What? But that... that's impossible.

21:01.202 --> 21:03.402
Today is December 7th,
Clarissa's birthday.

21:03.404 --> 21:06.305
I distinctly remember we
had a dinner reservation

21:06.307 --> 21:08.540
for this evening which
took me months to procure.

21:08.542 --> 21:10.042
Well, you must have blown her off.

21:10.044 --> 21:12.344
- This ought to be good.
- Should we stop him?

21:12.346 --> 21:14.304
Stop what? What am I doing?

21:14.329 --> 21:17.383
Mr. Darhk, uh, allow
me to introduce myself.

21:17.385 --> 21:20.919
My name is Martin Stein.
You may have heard of me.

21:20.921 --> 21:23.355
I'm on the negotiating team
and was recently nominated

21:23.357 --> 21:25.591
for my sixth Carlin Award in physics.

21:25.593 --> 21:26.659
Congratulations.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.060
Thank you.

21:28.062 --> 21:29.428
Did you follow me here?

21:29.430 --> 21:31.630
I did.

21:31.632 --> 21:34.800
You see, I'm... I'm working on a...
a transmutation project that

21:34.802 --> 21:36.869
is vital to national security.

21:36.871 --> 21:41.974
I was hoping you might pass the
proposal on to the President.

21:41.976 --> 21:44.543
Excuse me, I can't help
but notice you're wearing

21:44.545 --> 21:47.546
a Komandirskie watch, typically supplied to

21:47.548 --> 21:51.050
the Soviet Ministry of Defense.

21:51.052 --> 21:53.185
Meeting with a Soviet outside

21:53.187 --> 21:55.387
of the official negotiation schedule?

21:55.389 --> 21:58.323
That is highly irregular.

22:06.701 --> 22:08.500
Ray, Mick, get in there, now.

22:10.237 --> 22:11.783
Okay.

22:11.808 --> 22:15.741
Clearly, uh, there's been some
kind of misunderstanding.

22:15.743 --> 22:18.377
I'll just leave and pretend these last

22:18.379 --> 22:20.746
five minutes didn't happen.

22:20.748 --> 22:26.585
Unfortunately, my imagination
isn't quite that vivid.

22:28.756 --> 22:29.988
- Gray!
- Martin!

22:36.063 --> 22:40.299
Ahh.

22:40.301 --> 22:41.834
Ray, what happened?

22:41.836 --> 22:43.602
Darhk just stabbed Marty's younger self.

22:43.604 --> 22:44.937
Where's Darhk?

22:44.939 --> 22:47.406
We lost him.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.875
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you back.

22:53.403 --> 22:56.428
- Where is he?
- He's on his way now.

22:56.430 --> 22:58.563
Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.

22:58.565 --> 23:01.233
You again?

23:01.235 --> 23:03.902
I mean, me again.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.337
Guess you figured it out.

23:05.339 --> 23:07.105
How did this happen?

23:07.107 --> 23:09.941
I'm too young to die.
Too brilliant to die.

23:09.943 --> 23:11.643
Will one of you please shut me up?

23:11.645 --> 23:13.545
- Gladly.
- Gideon?

23:13.547 --> 23:15.847
I'm cauterizing the
younger Martin's wound.

23:15.849 --> 23:17.349
I'm afraid it will leave both patients

23:17.351 --> 23:19.017
with a rather nasty scar.

23:19.019 --> 23:20.585
You should've let me punch him.

23:20.587 --> 23:22.821
This is about time travel, isn't it?

23:22.823 --> 23:25.190
That's why Special Advisor
Darhk stabbed me.

23:25.192 --> 23:27.959
He wouldn't have stabbed you
if you had been having dinner

23:27.961 --> 23:30.028
with Clarissa at L'Auberge
as previously planned.

23:30.030 --> 23:31.963
Good God, Clarissa.

23:31.965 --> 23:33.632
She's waiting for me at the hotel.

23:33.634 --> 23:35.867
How could you have left
her alone on her birthday?

23:35.869 --> 23:37.269
She ordered room service.

23:37.271 --> 23:40.005
You are a careless, self-centered idiot.

23:40.007 --> 23:43.508
Gray, Gray, look, I'll go to the hotel,

23:43.510 --> 23:45.744
and I'll tell Clarissa that
her husband's working late.

23:45.746 --> 23:48.213
Okay? Just relax.

23:48.215 --> 23:53.752
Oh, oh, Martin, what on
Earth were you thinking?

23:56.657 --> 23:58.623
Hubba-hubba, who's that?

23:58.625 --> 24:00.392
Professor Stein's wife.

24:00.394 --> 24:02.727
Jax is at her hotel
explaining why she has to

24:02.729 --> 24:04.930
spend her birthday alone.

24:04.932 --> 24:07.032
Wait a minute, if he used everyone's

24:07.034 --> 24:09.267
favorite talking computer to find her...

24:10.704 --> 24:13.371
Gideon, do you have the
location on Damien Darhk?

24:13.373 --> 24:15.206
Unfortunately, I have no intel

24:15.208 --> 24:16.741
on his current whereabouts.

24:16.743 --> 24:18.376
But we know where he's gonna be.

24:18.378 --> 24:20.312
His little side deal with
the Soviets is going down

24:20.314 --> 24:21.846
at the State Dinner tomorrow night.

24:21.848 --> 24:23.281
Which is probably the
most heavily guarded

24:23.283 --> 24:24.602
dinner in history.

24:24.627 --> 24:26.718
I think we know someone
who may be able to help.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.953
Is that so?

24:27.955 --> 24:29.454
One of Amaya's old JSA buddies,

24:29.456 --> 24:31.189
and, by old, I mean old.

24:31.191 --> 24:32.891
He may still have some
government contacts

24:32.893 --> 24:35.393
- we can exploit.
- Absolutely not.

24:35.395 --> 24:37.829
Whatever Darhk is planning
to exchange with the Soviets,

24:37.831 --> 24:39.464
it can't be good.

24:39.466 --> 24:41.166
Well, I'll contact the FBI.

24:41.168 --> 24:42.667
You don't have to worry about it.

24:42.669 --> 24:44.436
Except we do. Darhk's working

24:44.438 --> 24:46.304
with a time traveler. That's way out

24:46.306 --> 24:47.606
of the Bureau's league.

24:47.608 --> 24:49.374
I believe this time traveler killed Rex.

24:49.376 --> 24:51.643
All the more reason to stay
clear of that State Dinner.

24:51.645 --> 24:53.712
You can't remain professional.

24:53.714 --> 24:55.513
Are you kidding me?
She's nothing but professional.

24:55.515 --> 24:57.248
She's all about being professional.

24:57.250 --> 24:58.817
The only reason I could ever see her

24:58.819 --> 25:01.526
not being... Oh, my God, you
and Rex Tyler were together.

25:01.551 --> 25:02.554
- No.
- They were together,

25:02.556 --> 25:04.823
weren't they? This makes total sense.

25:04.825 --> 25:06.124
We weren't together.

25:06.126 --> 25:08.126
Like I said before, fraternization among

25:08.128 --> 25:09.995
teammates is unprofessional.

25:12.132 --> 25:17.035
Rex and I were going to
leave the JSA after the war,

25:17.037 --> 25:20.038
try and start a new life with each other.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.973
And then he was cut down.

25:21.975 --> 25:24.809
That's why I left the team,
and that's why I wouldn't

25:24.811 --> 25:27.178
talk to you about them.

25:27.180 --> 25:29.014
It's too hard.

25:29.016 --> 25:32.150
And this is why I'm
reluctant to help you.

25:32.152 --> 25:35.186
Because your emotions are
clouding your judgment.

25:35.188 --> 25:37.522
She won't be facing Darhk alone.

25:37.524 --> 25:39.324
We need your help.

25:39.326 --> 25:41.860
I know you feel like I abandoned you,

25:41.862 --> 25:45.263
but, please, don't abandon me.

25:49.169 --> 25:51.536
Hey, how you doing?

25:51.538 --> 25:53.171
I'm all right.

25:53.173 --> 25:54.372
You know, the truth is,

25:54.374 --> 25:57.475
this young man is like a stranger to me.

25:57.477 --> 25:59.711
Every time I encounter
him, I can't imagine

25:59.713 --> 26:01.646
I was ever that person.

26:01.648 --> 26:03.648
I think anyone would
feel that way about meeting

26:03.650 --> 26:05.450
their younger self.

26:05.452 --> 26:07.352
I don't recognize my current self.

26:07.354 --> 26:09.487
Mick told me I need to be more like me.

26:09.489 --> 26:11.056
And he's right, which is rare.

26:11.058 --> 26:12.857
Hmm, indeed.

26:12.859 --> 26:16.528
The problem is I don't know
what being me means right now.

26:16.530 --> 26:18.196
I don't know if that makes any sense.

26:18.198 --> 26:19.664
Of course it does.

26:19.666 --> 26:22.767
I think everyone struggles
at least on occasion

26:22.769 --> 26:26.037
with who they are and
then what their place is

26:26.039 --> 26:27.505
in the world.

26:27.507 --> 26:29.240
So what's the answer?

26:29.242 --> 26:31.076
I have no idea.

26:31.078 --> 26:35.447
But, I suppose it's just to live.

26:35.449 --> 26:37.949
It's all any of us can really do.

26:37.951 --> 26:40.585
And then, hopefully,
through the act of living

26:40.587 --> 26:43.988
we discover who we truly are

26:43.990 --> 26:47.792
and learn to grow from that.

26:49.229 --> 26:52.330
Amaya got us invites to the State Dinner.

26:52.332 --> 26:53.732
Are you feeling up to it?

26:53.734 --> 26:57.202
Yes, I'm feeling much better.

26:57.204 --> 26:58.670
You feeling up to it?

26:58.672 --> 27:00.238
I think what he means is:
are you gonna create

27:00.240 --> 27:02.574
a diplomatic crisis and
risk unknown damage

27:02.576 --> 27:04.342
to history by killing Damien Darhk?

27:04.344 --> 27:06.678
I know what he means, Ray.

27:06.680 --> 27:12.383
Earlier, you accused me of
not ever caring for anyone,

27:12.385 --> 27:14.753
but you know that's not true.

27:16.289 --> 27:18.590
I care very much about you.

27:18.592 --> 27:21.793
And I'm less concerned about history

27:21.795 --> 27:23.862
than I am about your conscience.

27:23.864 --> 27:27.098
You're no longer an assassin, Sara.

27:27.100 --> 27:29.601
You're our Captain.

27:29.603 --> 27:31.035
Well, let's hope I remember that

27:31.037 --> 27:33.438
when the time comes.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.874
Now let's do this.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.460
Thank you for helping us get in.

27:55.462 --> 27:57.762
Feels good to be back in the game.

27:57.764 --> 27:59.364
I don't see Damien Darhk anywhere.

27:59.366 --> 28:00.665
He'll be here.

28:05.405 --> 28:08.239
Oh, my God, what is she doing here?

28:08.241 --> 28:10.408
Probably looking for her
husband, no doubt.

28:12.312 --> 28:14.546
She's... she's coming this way,
what... what should I do?

28:14.548 --> 28:16.047
Just... Just talk to her.

28:16.049 --> 28:19.918
Mr. Jackson, I expected
to meet my husband here.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.085
Have you seen him yet?

28:21.087 --> 28:23.221
I'm sorry, no. I haven't.

28:23.223 --> 28:25.290
I'd be worried, but it's just like Martin

28:25.292 --> 28:27.492
to lose track of time.

28:27.494 --> 28:28.960
Well, I'm sure, wherever he is,

28:28.962 --> 28:31.696
you are foremost in his mind.

28:31.698 --> 28:32.897
Who are you?

28:32.899 --> 28:34.999
I'm... I'm a colleague of his.

28:35.001 --> 28:38.236
My name is also Martin.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.004
He never mentioned you.

28:40.006 --> 28:42.807
Well, I'm sure he has more
important things to talk about.

28:44.177 --> 28:46.945
Oh, uh, would you...
Would you care to dance?

28:46.947 --> 28:50.448
I never seem to take the time
to enjoy these State Dinners.

28:50.450 --> 28:51.683
Sure.

28:57.858 --> 29:01.693
You all right? You seem tense.

29:01.695 --> 29:05.096
When you find Rex's killer,
what are you gonna do to him?

29:05.098 --> 29:08.366
Arrest him. What else is there?

29:08.368 --> 29:09.667
You could kill him.

29:09.669 --> 29:12.036
I'm a member of the Justice Society,

29:12.038 --> 29:14.472
or at least I was when it existed,

29:14.474 --> 29:16.741
I'm not some vigilante.

29:20.947 --> 29:23.348
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to pry, but you don't

29:23.350 --> 29:25.283
seem too happy to be here.

29:25.285 --> 29:29.721
It's just... Martin invited
me on this trip for my birthday,

29:29.723 --> 29:32.390
and I've spent the
better part of it alone.

29:32.392 --> 29:34.125
Perhaps you should talk to him.

29:34.127 --> 29:38.229
I've tried, but Martin's
love for nuclear science...

29:38.231 --> 29:40.365
It's irrepressible.

29:40.367 --> 29:42.634
Sometimes my husband has tunnel vision.

29:42.636 --> 29:48.239
Well, Martin is a fool, but,
believe me, he loves you.

29:48.241 --> 29:50.408
You're far more important to him than

29:50.410 --> 29:55.213
any of his scientific achievements.

29:55.215 --> 29:59.517
I have the strangest feeling,
like we've danced before.

30:02.789 --> 30:04.656
Sara, Darhk's in the hallway.

30:08.395 --> 30:12.997
Mick, Ray, guard the exits.
And everybody else,

30:12.999 --> 30:14.265
get ready to move.

30:20.907 --> 30:23.441
Now that our governments
are waging peace upstairs,

30:23.443 --> 30:25.543
what do you say we get
down to the real business?

30:25.545 --> 30:27.445
You have brought us the codes?

30:27.447 --> 30:29.113
It's called a CD-ROM, the latest

30:29.115 --> 30:30.949
in Defense Department technology.

30:30.951 --> 30:33.151
As for my half of the exchange?

30:46.833 --> 30:48.666
Hand over the box.

30:48.668 --> 30:50.702
And the kick-ass CD-ROM.

30:52.706 --> 30:53.972
What is this?

30:53.974 --> 30:55.872
_

30:57.177 --> 30:58.810
He thinks we're working with Darhk.

30:58.812 --> 30:59.811
Never.

30:59.813 --> 31:01.446
No one has to get hurt.

31:01.448 --> 31:02.747
That's not really my style.

31:02.749 --> 31:04.415
Now, we can waste time chit-chatting,

31:04.417 --> 31:06.284
or you can deal with the
explosive my people

31:06.286 --> 31:08.620
have secreted inside
the State Dining Room.

31:08.622 --> 31:11.089
See, in about six minutes,
Reagan, Gorbachev,

31:11.091 --> 31:13.558
and every hope of peace goes kaboom.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.260
- Ray?
- We're on it.

31:15.262 --> 31:18.663
I am sorry... inconvenient,
I know, but try being me.

31:38.184 --> 31:39.917
Todd?

31:46.226 --> 31:47.959
We're on the move to find the bomb.

31:47.961 --> 31:49.961
The bomb... We must save Clarissa.

32:04.110 --> 32:06.377
I got this, Sara. Go stop Darhk.

32:09.616 --> 32:10.615
Ooh!

32:13.553 --> 32:17.121
That's cool, man.

32:17.123 --> 32:18.790
Mary Todd's hope chest.

32:19.959 --> 32:22.593
Ooh, you have gone too far!

32:25.532 --> 32:26.798
Everyone.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.200
Get the hell out of here, right now.

32:32.672 --> 32:34.706
Now that we have your attention,

32:34.708 --> 32:36.908
would you all please leave
the dining room immediately?

32:36.910 --> 32:38.609
We believe there's a
bomb on the premises.

32:41.047 --> 32:42.580
Oof!

32:51.925 --> 32:55.093
- You okay?
- Who are you?

32:55.095 --> 32:57.795
A friend of your husband's.

33:06.339 --> 33:08.039
Good news, I found the bomb.

33:08.041 --> 33:09.941
Bad news, this type of
firing system is obsolete.

33:09.943 --> 33:12.043
I have no idea how to
disarm such a crude weapon.

33:12.045 --> 33:14.679
Figure it out, Ray.

33:14.681 --> 33:16.013
I'm a little busy.

33:22.822 --> 33:23.855
Rah!

33:26.860 --> 33:28.025
There's nothing I can do.

33:28.027 --> 33:29.427
Yes, there is.

33:29.429 --> 33:32.063
I was wrong trying to
make you like Snart.

33:32.065 --> 33:34.532
You're Ray Palmer...
You can science your way

33:34.534 --> 33:35.900
out of anything.

33:35.902 --> 33:39.470
I'm Ray Palmer. I'm Ray Palmer.

33:39.472 --> 33:41.472
I can science my way out of anything.

33:41.474 --> 33:43.875
I...

33:43.877 --> 33:45.943
If I can send an electrical
pulse from an outside

33:45.945 --> 33:48.379
power source, I might be able to overload

33:48.381 --> 33:49.981
the bomb's incendiary trigger,

33:49.983 --> 33:53.217
but I-I'd have to dismantle to cold gun.

33:53.219 --> 33:54.919
Less talking, more doing.

34:05.532 --> 34:06.697
Huh.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.507
No!

34:18.610 --> 34:19.911
Ahh!

34:22.514 --> 34:24.815
Ray?

34:24.818 --> 34:26.484
Tell me the bomb's disarmed.

34:26.485 --> 34:28.518
That would be a lie.

34:29.255 --> 34:32.924
Well, ten seconds to live.

34:32.926 --> 34:35.259
There are worse ways of dying.

34:46.639 --> 34:47.804
I did it.

34:49.074 --> 34:50.241
I did it.

34:50.243 --> 34:52.076
Good.

34:55.581 --> 34:57.448
Hold on, Todd. Okay?

34:57.450 --> 34:59.116
Just hold on.

35:00.954 --> 35:02.887
You and I have met before.

35:02.889 --> 35:06.958
New York City, 1942.
You haven't aged a bit.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.726
Lazarus Pit?

35:08.728 --> 35:11.429
Oh, woman of mystery.

35:11.431 --> 35:13.764
I know that look in your eye, though.

35:13.766 --> 35:17.969
That's the look of someone that
I've taken everything from.

35:17.971 --> 35:20.304
Not everything.

35:20.306 --> 35:22.740
You haven't taken my soul,

35:22.742 --> 35:26.711
which I've already lost,
and I'm not eager to do again.

35:26.713 --> 35:30.848
And that's why I'm sparing your life.

35:30.850 --> 35:32.283
How merciful of you.

35:32.285 --> 35:36.721
I'm sparing you to
prolong your suffering.

35:36.723 --> 35:40.124
'Cause I'm from the future,
Damien, and I know

35:40.126 --> 35:46.531
how this all ends.
Your ark, your grand vision.

35:46.533 --> 35:48.399
Just as you're about to accomplish

35:48.401 --> 35:51.269
everything you desire,

35:51.271 --> 35:55.907
your wife is murdered,
the love of your life.

35:55.909 --> 35:58.142
And in total despair,

35:58.144 --> 36:01.279
you even try to kill your own daughter.

36:01.281 --> 36:06.851
An entire city rises up against you,

36:06.853 --> 36:09.120
and then you die...

36:09.122 --> 36:12.456
defeated and alone.

36:16.829 --> 36:19.063
What happened? Where's Darhk?

36:19.065 --> 36:20.598
He took him.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.567
The time traveler working against us...

36:24.337 --> 36:26.103
He's a speedster.

36:26.105 --> 36:28.806
- Like the Flash?
- Faster.

36:28.808 --> 36:31.375
So the speedster and Darhk,
they have whatever

36:31.377 --> 36:33.010
the KGB gave Darhk?

36:33.012 --> 36:34.445
Unless...

36:34.447 --> 36:35.713
Unless?

36:37.383 --> 36:39.116
I swiped it off Darhk.

36:39.118 --> 36:42.587
Shut up.

36:42.589 --> 36:44.622
Can I hug you? Do we hug?

36:44.624 --> 36:47.258
- Okay, just this once.
- There's gonna be more.

36:49.128 --> 36:50.595
Yeah!

36:51.564 --> 36:54.131
You took a bullet for me.

36:54.133 --> 36:58.836
For a fellow member of
the JSA, it was nothing.

37:04.928 --> 37:07.396
Astonishing to be back here again.

37:07.398 --> 37:11.033
A ship that can travel through
time and heal any wound.

37:11.035 --> 37:13.301
- Think of the possibilities...
- Let me remind you,

37:13.303 --> 37:16.070
it's imperative that you
carry on as if you never

37:16.095 --> 37:18.287
so, me or anything else from the future.

37:18.312 --> 37:20.776
That you would pass
up the chance to show me

37:20.778 --> 37:22.978
even the barest glimpse of that future,

37:22.980 --> 37:26.782
catapulting our transmutation
research into the 21st century,

37:26.784 --> 37:29.418
I had no idea I could ever be so selfish.

37:29.420 --> 37:31.553
Interesting, considering that's exactly

37:31.555 --> 37:34.322
how you've been to Clarissa.
She nearly died last night

37:34.324 --> 37:37.926
because of your blind
devotion to your work.

37:41.932 --> 37:47.002
You of all people understand
the importance of our research.

37:47.004 --> 37:50.272
I understand the importance
of one thing and one thing only:

37:50.274 --> 37:53.108
After everything
I've accomplished, all...

37:53.110 --> 37:55.811
- All of the awards I've won...
- Did we win the sixth Carlin?

37:55.813 --> 38:01.049
The only thing that brings
meaning to my life is Clarissa.

38:02.619 --> 38:05.120
Yes, Martin, our wife, who you spent

38:05.122 --> 38:08.924
the last two days ignoring.

38:08.926 --> 38:10.692
But I love Clarissa.

38:10.694 --> 38:13.829
Then cherish her, Martin,

38:13.831 --> 38:16.598
because I promise you,

38:16.600 --> 38:21.470
she is the only thing you
will care to remember.

38:22.639 --> 38:25.240
And I promise you...

38:25.242 --> 38:29.811
I'll make sure she knows I love her.

38:29.813 --> 38:31.746
I pray that you do.

38:45.696 --> 38:47.796
Are you sure you won't come with us?

38:47.798 --> 38:49.831
Rex's killer is still out there.

38:49.833 --> 38:51.433
We could find him together.

38:51.435 --> 38:55.003
I think last night proved
my fighting days are over.

38:55.005 --> 38:57.105
You were amazing out there.

38:57.107 --> 38:59.841
It felt like old times.

38:59.843 --> 39:04.346
But there's something keeping
you here in 1987, isn't there?

39:04.348 --> 39:08.683
After the JSA disbanded,
I spent a lot of lonely years

39:08.685 --> 39:12.053
until I finally met someone, Amaya.

39:12.055 --> 39:14.389
And he's waiting for me at home.

39:15.926 --> 39:18.393
I have ameliorated Mr. Rice's injuries.

39:18.395 --> 39:21.363
That's incredible. Wow.

39:25.202 --> 39:29.070
A word of advice from an old
man who's lived long enough

39:29.072 --> 39:33.208
to see the world change,
and mostly for the better:

39:33.210 --> 39:37.245
If you are lucky enough
to find love again...

39:38.849 --> 39:41.183
Embrace it.

39:41.185 --> 39:42.851
Are you leaving already?

39:42.853 --> 39:45.053
I was hoping we'd have a beer.

39:45.055 --> 39:49.424
Oh, unlike you, my time is limited,

39:49.426 --> 39:51.493
and I don't need the carbs.

39:52.296 --> 39:53.895
Good-bye, Todd.

40:05.776 --> 40:07.242
Well, I guess I just, uh...

40:07.244 --> 40:08.944
He loved to sing.

40:10.781 --> 40:13.982
Henry, your grandfather.

40:13.984 --> 40:18.253
He had a... A beautiful voice.

40:18.255 --> 40:21.056
During long convoys or stake-outs,

40:21.058 --> 40:23.592
he would serenade the team.

40:23.594 --> 40:26.595
He made it his personal mission
to get me to sing along,

40:26.597 --> 40:31.299
but he never succeeded.

40:31.301 --> 40:34.002
But when the chips were down

40:34.004 --> 40:36.938
and all hope seemed lost,

40:36.940 --> 40:40.175
we could always count on
Henry to lift our spirits.

40:40.177 --> 40:44.045
That's the kind of man
your grandfather was.

40:47.851 --> 40:49.084
Then take me back there now.

40:49.086 --> 40:50.518
I will get your item back for you.

40:50.520 --> 40:52.554
The Legends have left 1987.

40:52.556 --> 40:54.189
The item is beyond your reach.

40:54.191 --> 40:56.625
That blonde woman...
She's a time traveler like you.

40:56.627 --> 40:58.226
She knows what happens
to me in the future.

40:58.228 --> 41:00.695
- I'm sure she does.
- Then take me with you.

41:00.697 --> 41:02.564
I need to change my destiny.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.935
Tell you what, why don't we work together

41:06.937 --> 41:09.537
to change both of our destinies?

41:11.842 --> 41:13.675
Step inside.

41:23.320 --> 41:24.552
Whoa.
