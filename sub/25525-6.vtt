14:58.246 --> 15:00.246
or even the Denalese smugglers.

15:00.248 --> 15:02.473
You're good with words. You'll
talk your way out of any problem.

15:02.475 --> 15:05.118
What? Me? No, no, no, absolutely not.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.019
I am way... [GROANS]

15:07.021 --> 15:09.021
I am way too busy.

15:09.023 --> 15:11.391
[STAMMERING] I'm helping
Captain Garret Spears

15:11.393 --> 15:13.092
with a Plagueling problem and...

15:13.094 --> 15:15.361
And I'm helping dear
Talon translate some...

15:15.363 --> 15:19.031
Captain Spears and that girl are more
important to you than your mother?

15:19.033 --> 15:21.801
No, of course not. But, oh, Mum,

15:21.803 --> 15:24.003
on the way to Gallows
Rock are the Plaguelings,

15:24.005 --> 15:26.653
not to mention that the bandits are
probably the ones selling the stuff.

15:26.655 --> 15:28.808
Either way, I'm going to be dead.

15:28.810 --> 15:31.844
- Munt will look after you.
- No.

15:34.482 --> 15:35.615
No?

15:36.851 --> 15:39.452
No?

15:39.454 --> 15:42.155
After everything I've done for you?

15:42.157 --> 15:45.792
You ungrateful little twit!

15:45.794 --> 15:48.060
Mother, I have done everything
you have ever asked for,

15:48.062 --> 15:51.397
right or wrong, but this time you're
going to have to find somebody else.

15:51.399 --> 15:52.999
There isn't anybody else!

15:53.001 --> 15:55.983
Bill's dead, and Munt's a halfwit!

16:01.976 --> 16:04.477
- Munt will look after you.
- [CHUCKLES]

16:04.479 --> 16:07.413
Munt would have me dead
if it came down to it.

16:07.415 --> 16:09.782
You listen to me.

16:09.784 --> 16:11.684
I'm the one who took you in.

16:11.686 --> 16:13.453
I fed you, I clothed you,

16:13.455 --> 16:15.888
I raised you as my own.

16:15.890 --> 16:20.660
And I can put your little ass back out
on the street again any time I want.

16:20.662 --> 16:22.929
I appreciate what you're saying.

16:22.931 --> 16:27.033
I just believe that going into the
colipsum trade so big is a grave mistake.

16:27.035 --> 16:30.303
I've made a lot of grave
mistakes in my life.

16:30.305 --> 16:31.871
Don't you be one of them.

16:43.985 --> 16:46.819
You caused nothing but pain
and suffering in my life...

16:50.024 --> 16:52.425
but I'm gonna miss you, old man.

16:58.399 --> 17:02.735
Well, I suppose it's one
less body I have to clean up.

17:04.539 --> 17:07.573
There's one in the nightshade,
three more in the sewer.

17:07.575 --> 17:10.209
And one more in the street.

17:10.211 --> 17:13.112
Had a busy night.

17:13.114 --> 17:16.315
All the Bones are dead.

17:16.317 --> 17:18.550
The Lu-Qiri's gone..

17:18.553 --> 17:21.420
You won't have any more trouble from me.

17:21.422 --> 17:23.623
I'll leave the Outpost as agreed.

17:24.893 --> 17:29.829
Good, but, uh, before I escort you out,

17:29.831 --> 17:32.768
Lady Calkussar requests your presence.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.569
Here she is.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.973
Still alive, as it happens.

17:55.975 --> 17:57.908
Marshal, wait outside.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.476
This doesn't concern you.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.261
Talon...

18:19.331 --> 18:20.998
we have so much to talk about.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.776
Start with how you decide
to let Wythers take my head.

18:23.779 --> 18:26.837
It was not a decision
that I made lightly.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.839
At the time, I could see no other way.

18:28.841 --> 18:32.643
Than to save your own
skin. I understand.

18:32.645 --> 18:36.747
Are we done here? I have
to be gone by sundown.

18:36.749 --> 18:40.484
Wythers blackmailed me to get to you.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.053
I hated myself for what I did.

18:44.557 --> 18:48.392
Please, I wish you to stay.

18:50.763 --> 18:54.398
Help me overthrow the Prime Order.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.034
What?

18:57.036 --> 18:59.203
Is that why you want me here?

18:59.205 --> 19:01.038
To help you commit treason?

19:01.040 --> 19:04.675
Just stop letting your
tongue run wild and listen.

19:04.677 --> 19:09.162
My name is not Gwynn, and Commander
Calkussar is not my father.

19:11.062 --> 19:14.117
I am Rosmund, daughter of King Ranulf,

19:14.120 --> 19:16.820
which makes me heir to the Realm.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.460
So let's say I believe you.

19:23.462 --> 19:26.130
What do I do now? Am
I supposed to kneel?

19:26.132 --> 19:30.200
No. No, not at all.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.069
I hope that we can still be friends.

19:32.071 --> 19:35.072
Yes, well, we can always hope.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.975
And I'm hoping that
you'll join our cause.

19:37.977 --> 19:41.578
What can a few hundred men at the
Outpost do against the Prime Order?

19:43.515 --> 19:47.116
We have more men than you think.

19:47.119 --> 19:50.087
And with your help, Talon,
we'll have more than just men.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.256
You'll have men, plus a woman.

19:54.103 --> 19:55.969
Tell me of this demon.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.063
So does everyone know about that now?

20:00.065 --> 20:02.399
Only those who need to know.

20:04.185 --> 20:09.239
The demon is gone. I sent
it back where it belongs.

20:09.241 --> 20:12.873
Well, tell me more.
I want to understand.

20:12.876 --> 20:15.279
Are there more than one such creature?

20:15.281 --> 20:19.583
So I've been told, but
I only have one name.

20:19.585 --> 20:22.381
It's how I summon them, by its name.

20:22.384 --> 20:23.775
Well, then you need to find more.

20:23.778 --> 20:25.254
How did you find the first one?

20:25.257 --> 20:28.225
The smith, but he's dead now.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.264
- The Book of Names.
- What?

20:34.266 --> 20:35.866
I have to go.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.202
But you'll stay here?

20:38.204 --> 20:39.603
At the Outpost?

20:39.605 --> 20:41.303
For now.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.716
We're done here. Stop reading.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.151
I'm just getting started.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.224
And I've already
learned so much already.

20:56.227 --> 20:58.488
- Why don't you want to know?
- Because I think the Book of Names

20:58.490 --> 21:01.295
- is actually a book full of...
- Full of demon names?

21:06.465 --> 21:09.733
You see, I've been
doing some reading now.

21:09.735 --> 21:13.370
You do have black blood, don't you?

21:13.372 --> 21:16.406
Hmm? You see, I'm sure
I read somewhere in here

21:16.408 --> 21:19.784
something about the black
blood summoning the Lu-Qiri...

21:19.787 --> 21:22.579
Oh, Lu-Qiri is a
different name for demon.

21:22.581 --> 21:24.514
I know what a Lu-Qiri is, Janzo.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.842
'Cause that's what
stabbed you, isn't it? Hmm?

21:26.845 --> 21:29.870
The Lu-Qiri? You're basically a witch.

21:29.873 --> 21:32.022
[LAUGHS] And... and if you...

21:32.024 --> 21:34.891
If you had access to all
of these demon names, well,

21:34.893 --> 21:37.594
you could just summon
up a whole army of them.

21:37.596 --> 21:39.830
And that is precisely
why we're not doing this.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.665
Not this one.

21:41.667 --> 21:44.434
- Give it to me, Janzo.
- You made a promise to the smith

21:44.436 --> 21:47.092
that you would find the Book of Names.

21:47.095 --> 21:49.462
- It's not that simple.
- Oh?

21:49.465 --> 21:51.615
Not as simple as sticking to your word

21:51.618 --> 21:53.870
and carrying out the
smith's last dying wish?

21:53.873 --> 21:56.113
Oh, shut up.

21:56.115 --> 22:00.050
Look, even if you did
find the Book of Names,

22:00.052 --> 22:04.021
it doesn't mean that you have to use it.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.223
I don't think I'll be able to find it.

22:06.225 --> 22:11.128
And I... I don't know how to
speak or read "Yindarian" and...

22:11.130 --> 22:13.279
Yindrian.

22:13.376 --> 22:14.775
Yindrian.

22:17.469 --> 22:19.153
I can only look at the pictures.

22:19.156 --> 22:21.438
It's not a problem. I already told you

22:21.440 --> 22:23.121
I will sit here for days

22:23.124 --> 22:25.258
and read through all of
these books just for you.

22:27.572 --> 22:29.712
Why are you always so nice to me, Janzo?

22:29.715 --> 22:32.182
[CHUCKLES]

22:32.184 --> 22:35.485
I just like being around
somebody like you, that's all.

22:35.487 --> 22:40.357
I find your life to be
interesting and thrilling.

22:40.359 --> 22:44.561
Also, I kind of need a
little small favor in return.

22:47.299 --> 22:49.099
What kind of favor?

22:49.101 --> 22:52.502
Well, you see, I'm... I'm
going traveling for a few days

22:52.504 --> 22:56.306
and to deliver some stuff,
and I need a travel companion.

22:56.308 --> 23:00.344
You know, somebody to talk to
and... and help me carry the stuff.

23:00.346 --> 23:02.112
Well, it's not a little favor, is it?

23:02.114 --> 23:06.283
Oh, right.

23:06.285 --> 23:10.426
I suppose neither is translating
all of these books and papers.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.856
Will you come with me?

23:15.859 --> 23:17.961
The smith said I need
to find the Book of Names

23:17.963 --> 23:21.064
before something called
the Dragman finds me.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.733
"Before the Dragman finds you"?

23:22.735 --> 23:24.234
Mm-hmm.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.104
Why?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.481
Is there something you know about it?

23:30.484 --> 23:32.284
No.

23:32.287 --> 23:34.020
Then why are you acting weird?

23:34.023 --> 23:38.292
Just in Yindrian, there's
a word, <i>Drogemane...</i>

23:38.295 --> 23:40.684
- Which means?
- "Death."

23:40.686 --> 23:42.332
Death?

23:44.323 --> 23:46.723
Maybe. Maybe not.

23:46.725 --> 23:48.892
Come on, pick up two or
three of these books and, um,

23:48.894 --> 23:50.494
we can help solve your
problem along the way.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.754
- I don't know.
- Talon,

23:52.757 --> 23:55.632
if you don't come with
me, I may not survive.

23:55.634 --> 23:58.301
Then who's going to translate
all of these books for you, hmm?

24:00.205 --> 24:04.107
So the truth is you don't actually
want me there for my company, do you?

24:04.109 --> 24:05.242
You want my protection.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.977
Pretty much. [CHUCKLES]

24:06.979 --> 24:09.012
And also there might be some...

24:09.014 --> 24:11.681
Some Plaguelings and...
And bandits along the way.

24:11.683 --> 24:13.717
But it'll be really
fun. Come on, let's go.

24:19.702 --> 24:21.707
These men you've gathered,

24:21.709 --> 24:24.076
how do you know they're
going to rally for our cause?

24:24.078 --> 24:26.411
Common men aren't
concerned about causes.

24:26.413 --> 24:28.174
They're about their own
necks, their next meal,

24:28.175 --> 24:29.581
and the safety of their loved ones,

24:29.583 --> 24:31.049
probably in that order.

24:31.051 --> 24:32.651
We'll promise them all three.

24:32.653 --> 24:35.038
You have a low opinion
of the common man.

24:37.091 --> 24:38.523
Halt.

24:38.526 --> 24:41.293
They must be on their way to the
Outpost for the late shipment.

24:41.295 --> 24:43.562
Or because of Magmoor.

24:45.533 --> 24:46.665
Hail!

24:47.672 --> 24:49.372
We've got 20 score swords in the wagon.

24:49.375 --> 24:51.069
We can't afford to lose them.

24:51.072 --> 24:53.238
- Not now.
- I'll take care of this.

24:53.241 --> 24:57.510
Anything happens, protect
Gwynn at all costs.

Come on. [CLICKS TONGUE]

25:17.665 --> 25:20.933
Indeed. What are you
doing all the way out here?

25:20.935 --> 25:23.869
We're just about to break camp
for our final leg to the Outpost

25:23.871 --> 25:26.921
to collect that shipment
of armaments you owe us.

25:26.924 --> 25:28.774
And here you come with it.

25:28.776 --> 25:30.351
It's better late than never, eh?

25:30.354 --> 25:31.991
Listen, don't worry about the shipment.

25:31.994 --> 25:34.143
We'll take it the rest of
the way to Eckly Station.

25:34.146 --> 25:36.715
Nonsense. We'll take it from here.

25:36.717 --> 25:38.951
I have very direct orders
to accompany the shipment...

25:38.953 --> 25:42.921
And I have remanded
those orders, Captain.

25:42.923 --> 25:46.491
Do you have the relinquishment
papers and inventories?

25:46.494 --> 25:48.828
Of course.

Looks like the Commander still

I think it's about time you tell
me what's really in the barrels.

28:50.725 --> 28:54.126
I know you didn't bring me
out this far to deliver wine.

28:54.128 --> 28:56.829

29:02.236 --> 29:05.304
of raw colipsum from an unknown seller.

29:08.042 --> 29:09.508
So what's in those barrels?

29:09.510 --> 29:13.378
Gold. A small fortune in gold.

29:26.060 --> 29:28.660
It's on the high mountain road.

But ever since the upper
mines dried up, well,

No one really goes that way, anymore?

Are you listening to yourself?

29:39.419 --> 29:41.507
Listen, I told you it was dangerous.

The Mistress has finally done you in.

Are you even sure there's gold
in those barrels and not rocks?

29:46.781 --> 29:48.981
[SCOFFS] Yeah, of course I'm sure.

29:58.306 --> 29:59.906
There, you see?

30:04.365 --> 30:07.266
- I'm taking my share before we get robbed.
- Uh, share?

30:07.268 --> 30:09.001
Who said anything about a share?

30:09.003 --> 30:12.504
No, no, no. You are here in
exchange for reading your books.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.942
You won't be reading
anything when you're dead.

30:16.377 --> 30:18.127
Do you really think
I'm going to be dead?

30:18.130 --> 30:20.813
I'll try to not let that happen.

30:20.815 --> 30:23.348
This is just insurance.

30:23.350 --> 30:25.994
Excuse me, I'm going to need
those coins to trade the colipsum.

30:25.997 --> 30:28.754
I'm almost certain they're
not going to count every coin.

30:30.558 --> 30:32.291
Come on.

30:32.293 --> 30:34.693
We're leaving the cart here.

30:34.695 --> 30:37.529
- Why?
- Short cut. It'll save us half a day.

30:37.531 --> 30:39.431
Come on, help me.

30:39.433 --> 30:41.033
Help me.

30:46.440 --> 30:50.442
- There's so many.
- This is only the beginning.

30:50.444 --> 30:53.612
When people find out
about you and who you are,

30:53.614 --> 30:57.549
men will flock to your banners.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.398
I've done nothing to deserve their loyalty

30:59.399 --> 31:01.026
except be born to the right parents.

31:01.028 --> 31:04.156
Which means the gods are in your blood.

31:04.158 --> 31:05.991
You were put in this world

31:05.993 --> 31:07.966
to make things right again.

31:10.097 --> 31:12.798
I don't know if I can do that.

31:12.800 --> 31:17.002
You must try. Your whole
life has led to this moment.

31:17.004 --> 31:21.506
Otherwise, the real Gwynn,

31:21.508 --> 31:23.475
she gave her life for naught.

31:41.695 --> 31:43.662
How about you?

31:43.664 --> 31:46.105
I've pretty much been everywhere.

31:46.108 --> 31:47.599
Been to the capital?

31:47.601 --> 31:51.670
No. Wouldn't last long there.

31:51.672 --> 31:56.074
The Covenant controls everything
from the roads to the markets.

31:56.076 --> 32:00.512
There's no gambling, no
fighting, no drinking.

32:00.514 --> 32:02.457
I've heard it's quite immaculate.

32:02.460 --> 32:05.716
The walls are meant to be
covered in pure white marble.

32:05.719 --> 32:10.055
And... and the towers, they
have this gold trim around them.

32:10.057 --> 32:11.757
I've always want to see it.

32:11.759 --> 32:15.294
It's all a show to hide
the evil that's inside.

32:15.296 --> 32:18.785
They're all murderers,
every single one of them.

32:22.676 --> 32:24.415
Just nod your head and keep walking.

If you stop, they'll expect something.

who has lost a loved one at
the hands of the Prime Order?

36:07.237 --> 36:09.904
No one?

36:09.906 --> 36:13.107
Do you live in such
fear of the Prime Order

36:13.109 --> 36:16.177
that you will not honor the
memory of your loved ones?

of a Covenant officer.

Who among you has seen a loved one

put to death for speaking
out against tyranny?

Who among you has witnessed murder,

at the hands of the
Prime Order soldiers?

Yes, the Greyskins are and
always will be our enemy.

But our greatest enemy walks among us.
