00:58.392 --> 01:00.016
If you were to ask
the five best

01:00.018 --> 01:02.103
filmmakers in the
world right now

01:02.105 --> 01:04.022
to make a movie like this,

01:04.815 --> 01:08.442
it, it wouldn't even be
in the same universe.

01:08.444 --> 01:10.194
I was blown away.
Like, like three minutes in

01:10.196 --> 01:10.986
I turn to my friend and go,

01:10.988 --> 01:11.945
"This is the fucking
greatest movie

01:11.947 --> 01:13.322
I've ever
seen in my life."

01:13.324 --> 01:17.242
It has withstood,
like, ten years.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.161
And people are still
watching a movie

01:19.163 --> 01:20.245
and talking about a movie.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.498
People aren't doing that about
whatever won the Oscar

01:22.500 --> 01:24.125
for Best Picture ten years ago.

01:24.127 --> 01:25.959
What genius is behind this?

01:25.961 --> 01:27.253
Tommy wanted to break...

01:27.255 --> 01:29.087
Tommy wanted to break
barriers in filmmaking.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.423
I think that he had a
very clear vision.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.049
He is a figure of mystery
where, you know,

01:33.051 --> 01:34.843
you do wanna learn
more about him.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.637
Who is this man?
Who is this auteur?

01:36.639 --> 01:40.224
The kind of sheer
ambition of it is...

01:40.226 --> 01:41.851
is incredible.

01:41.853 --> 01:44.352
The numbers probably prove

01:44.354 --> 01:47.522
how unlikely it is that
you'll make it.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.816
If I had a time machine,
I wouldn't

01:48.818 --> 01:51.694
go do a bunch of st...
uh, stuff you...

01:51.696 --> 01:55.364
I would go back
and try and get on that set,

01:55.366 --> 01:57.992
just to watch
and feel what it was like.

01:57.994 --> 02:00.705
'Cause it has
to be unbelievable.

02:03.120 --> 02:08.120
Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:14.218 --> 02:19.556
We'll hang ourselves tomorrow.
Unless God-oh comes.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.435
And, and if he comes?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.020
We'll be saved.

02:24.354 --> 02:25.354
Well.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.693
Sh... Shall we go?

02:31.694 --> 02:32.904
Pull on your trousers.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.570
What?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.449
Pull on your trousers.

02:37.242 --> 02:39.157
You want me to
pull off my trousers?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.244
I want you to stop. Stop.

02:41.246 --> 02:44.871
Jesus. That was
painfully unremarkable.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.165
Rob. Y-You're like a robot.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.668
- Yeah.
- And it's "Godot."

02:48.670 --> 02:50.046
- Sorry.
- And Greg.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.714
You're so scared.
And so insecure.

02:53.716 --> 02:55.633
You're like a,
like a wounded puppy.

02:55.635 --> 02:57.887
Do you even want to be an actor?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.430
Uh, yeah, m...
more than anything.

03:00.432 --> 03:02.389
Okay, well, then it must
be a big secret,

03:02.391 --> 03:04.433
because I can't tell at all.

03:04.435 --> 03:07.186
You've been coming to class for,
like, two months now.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.770
And, um...

03:08.772 --> 03:12.316
you need to,
to loosen up and relax.

03:12.318 --> 03:14.943
You gotta really
just expose yourself

03:14.945 --> 03:16.778
or no one's ever gonna care.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.739
- Okay, Greg?
- Yeah, okay.

03:18.741 --> 03:19.909
Okay. Thank you.

03:22.286 --> 03:26.748
Okay, who here can really reveal
themselves to the class?

03:27.291 --> 03:28.291
Anybody?

03:29.753 --> 03:30.753
I go.

03:32.087 --> 03:35.257
Great. What do you
have for us today, Thomas?

03:35.717 --> 03:36.717
It Tommy.

03:36.885 --> 03:37.969
Always Tommy.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.678
You, come on, we do scene.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.262
Okay.

03:50.981 --> 03:51.982
What are we doing?

03:53.318 --> 03:54.318
Do you know?

03:54.569 --> 03:55.695
Just go with it.

04:02.785 --> 04:05.789
Stella.

04:07.498 --> 04:10.375
Stella!

04:12.003 --> 04:14.503
Stella!

04:14.505 --> 04:15.504
What is he doing?

04:15.506 --> 04:19.510
Stella!

04:20.094 --> 04:22.012
Stella!

04:24.140 --> 04:27.560
Stella! Stella!

04:32.231 --> 04:33.647
Oh, no.
I think he's nailing it.

04:33.649 --> 04:34.859
Stella!

04:40.197 --> 04:42.700
Stella. Stella.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.548
Don't ever leave me, baby.

04:59.174 --> 05:02.553
Uh... Thank you for that.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.222
Hey.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.725
Uh, e-excuse me.

05:09.060 --> 05:10.060
Tommy?

05:13.647 --> 05:14.647
Hey.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.859
Um, I'm... I'm Greg.

05:17.902 --> 05:20.070
Yeah. I see you in there.

05:20.863 --> 05:23.405
Um, I was, I was just
wondering if you maybe

05:23.407 --> 05:25.075
wanted to do a scene together?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.371
You want to do scene with me?

05:30.039 --> 05:31.039
Yeah.

05:34.085 --> 05:35.085
Okay.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.005
Okay.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.008
No blitzing! Hit it! Hit it!

05:42.010 --> 05:43.887
Yeah! That's my boy!

05:44.094 --> 05:45.635
What you got?

05:45.637 --> 05:47.724
Oh, oh. Hey, hey. Car, car.
Sidewalk. Sidewalk.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.832
Hey, j... Uh, give
me a second, guys.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.354
Hey.

05:56.274 --> 05:57.607
All your friend little kid?

05:57.609 --> 06:00.066
Yeah, no, I was,
I was just waiting for you.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.277
Okay. Get in.

06:01.279 --> 06:03.320
I, I thought we were
just gonna do it at my place.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.491
No, I have to eat.

06:05.241 --> 06:07.201
Don't worry, I know a great place.
You'll love it.

06:07.618 --> 06:08.618
O... Okay.

06:09.204 --> 06:10.119
And bring football.

06:10.121 --> 06:11.121
Sure

06:11.914 --> 06:12.871
All right, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go, guys.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.999
I'll see you guys later.

06:16.919 --> 06:17.920
Nice car.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.296
Why? You poor?

06:21.423 --> 06:23.861
Oh, no, just, you know, none of
my friends have a car this nice.

06:23.885 --> 06:25.428
'Cause all your
friends little kid.

06:25.969 --> 06:28.513
Yeah, no, I just mean
it's expensive.

06:28.515 --> 06:29.806
It's nice. That's, that's all.

06:29.808 --> 06:30.808
Don't talk about me.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.433
What?

06:32.435 --> 06:35.313
What I drive. What I say.
What I do.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.440
Don't tell anybody.
You understand, yeah?

06:38.649 --> 06:40.818
- Yeah, no, I... I won't.
- Okay.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.154
And don't look at robot crab.
He shy.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.658
Bye, little kids.

06:51.830 --> 06:54.707
So. Why you bring me here?

06:55.750 --> 06:56.793
Wha... What do you mean?

06:57.626 --> 06:58.626
Scene partner.

06:59.337 --> 07:00.337
That joke?

07:01.214 --> 07:02.505
- No, not at all.
- Then what, Greg?

07:02.507 --> 07:03.550
I don't see point.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.760
Okay. Um... All right, listen.

07:07.762 --> 07:09.679
When, um, when I,
when I get up

07:09.681 --> 07:11.763
on stage in front of people,

07:11.765 --> 07:13.558
it's like all I can
think about is, uh,

07:13.560 --> 07:16.561
"What if, what if they laugh at
me or if I embarrass myself?"

07:16.563 --> 07:20.356
Um, but you, man, you're, like,
fucking fearless, and I just...

07:20.358 --> 07:21.693
I... I wanna feel that, too.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.820
I just, I want, I want that.
I want what, what you have.

07:25.822 --> 07:27.195
And I just, I...
I figured I could,

07:27.197 --> 07:28.530
I could learn something
from you.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.200
- That's... That's it.
- Oh, all right.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.078
- Yeah.
- Let's do scene.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.331
Oh, you wanna, you wanna
do a scene here?

07:37.541 --> 07:38.833
Are you not dedicated actor?

07:38.835 --> 07:40.115
I'm dedicated. I just...
There...

07:41.087 --> 07:42.335
You know, there's other people
eating, and I just don't...

07:42.337 --> 07:43.462
I don't care about these people.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.715
Come on. You have to do it.

07:45.549 --> 07:46.842
O... Okay. Yeah.

07:47.051 --> 07:50.135
I'll play the man,
The Lightning-Rod Man.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.220
And you play this
other one with the Z.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.347
Uh, Zechariah. Zechariah.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.434
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:55.810 --> 07:56.895
Good day, sir.

07:58.229 --> 07:59.563
Uh... Good day.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.731
Come on. You have to be louder.

08:01.733 --> 08:03.148
Tommy, I just, I don't...

08:03.150 --> 08:04.734
Don't worry about these people.

08:04.736 --> 08:06.902
There only you
and there only me.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.364
Now do it. Project.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.698
- O-Okay.
- Good day, sir.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.366
Okay. Um... um...

08:13.368 --> 08:15.244
- Don't be weird. Just do it.
- Yeah, I'm... I'm...

08:15.246 --> 08:16.996
I'm sorry...

08:16.998 --> 08:21.292
H... Have I the honor... A visit,
uh, from the illustrious g-god,

08:21.294 --> 08:22.751
- Jupiter Tonans.
- Okay, that's good.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.796
- Okay, that's good. Keep going.
- All right. Uh... S... Uh...

08:24.798 --> 08:28.424
So stood, stood he in,
in the Greek statue, uh, of old,

08:28.426 --> 08:30.383
grasping the lightning bolts.

08:30.385 --> 08:34.847
- Yeah. What you doing?
- If you be he or his viceroy,

08:34.849 --> 08:36.432
- I... I have to, uh, thank...
- Okay, thank God.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.976
I have to thank you for this
noble storm you have,

08:38.977 --> 08:40.394
have brewed among our mountains.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.980
Okay, that's great.
Now, we're at top of mountain.

08:42.982 --> 08:45.399
The rain pouring, wind going.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.028
And the lightning, everything.

08:49.030 --> 08:51.783
A very fine rod. I dare say.

08:52.242 --> 08:55.659
And what are these particular
precautions of yours?

08:55.661 --> 08:57.455
Close yonder shutter.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.372
The slanting rain
beating through.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.165
- Come on, come on.
- All right. Uh...

09:02.167 --> 09:04.043
- Mountain top right now.
- Are...

09:04.045 --> 09:06.462
- There's rain and wind going.
- Yeah.

09:06.464 --> 09:07.924
Are... Are you, are you mad?

09:08.258 --> 09:11.425
Uh... Know you not
that, uh, yon...

09:11.427 --> 09:14.804
yon iron bar
is a swift conductor?

09:14.806 --> 09:16.766
Pray touch the bell pull there.

09:17.099 --> 09:21.309
Uh... Are, are you frantic?
Are you frantic?

09:21.311 --> 09:24.438
Never touch bell wire
in a thunderstorm.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.313
Oh, wow.

09:25.315 --> 09:28.985
- Nor ring a bell of any sort.
- Wow!

09:28.987 --> 09:31.069
How about this guy? Wow.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.113
- Wow.
- Thank you.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.323
Wow. Everybody got lucky today.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.617
You don't have to pay
for this performance.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.745
Thank you.
You're welcome very much.

09:39.747 --> 09:43.039
Tommy,
that felt fucking amazing, man.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.126
There you go.
Now you're acting, Greg.

09:45.128 --> 09:48.131
That was like Shakespeare.

09:49.924 --> 09:52.051
Uh. Whoa.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.307
How uh... how often
do you play football, Tommy?

09:55.596 --> 09:56.847
I love football.

09:58.099 --> 10:00.727
- You love it?
- It's nice to play?

10:01.018 --> 10:02.017
Yeah, I agree.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.021
- Great American game.
- Yeah.

10:05.190 --> 10:07.358
Okay. Got it here.

10:08.777 --> 10:10.358
You ever been to Los Angeles?

10:10.360 --> 10:13.197
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Once. Uh...
When I was little.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.448
Yeah. My mom took me down there.

10:15.450 --> 10:17.410
It's like, best two days
of my life.

10:17.660 --> 10:21.539
Los Angeles,
everybody want to be star.

10:22.373 --> 10:24.207
All the pretty boys,

10:24.209 --> 10:27.043
they lining up
for their big shot.

10:27.045 --> 10:29.380
Just, uh...
Just have to get lucky, I guess.

10:30.006 --> 10:35.345
No. No. It's not luck, Greg.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.514
Greg, you have to be the best.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.972
You have to be
the best you can be.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.601
And never give up.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.728
Whoa. What are you...
What are we doing here?

10:46.730 --> 10:48.690
What... Okay.

10:50.359 --> 10:53.570
- All right.
- Touchdown!

10:53.905 --> 10:55.112
Touchdown!

10:55.114 --> 10:56.950
- Touchdown!
- Touchdown!

10:57.992 --> 11:00.034
This is a cool
fucking building, man.

11:00.036 --> 11:01.196
How long have you lived here?

11:02.080 --> 11:04.581
Must ask you again,
don't talk about me.

11:04.833 --> 11:07.919
- Not to class. Not to anybody.
- Yeah, no. Of course.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.383
This is it.

11:19.513 --> 11:20.513
Okay.

11:23.560 --> 11:24.560
Come in.

11:25.436 --> 11:26.437
You can go in there.

11:26.896 --> 11:27.981
Maid on vacation.

11:30.108 --> 11:31.109
Whoa.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.948
Uh, Tommy, where, uh,
where're you from?

11:38.867 --> 11:41.659
- From New Orleans.
- Uh, no, like uh, originally.

11:41.661 --> 11:43.955
Yeah, that one.
You know, Louisiana.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.038
Oh, okay.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.914
The accent threw me off.

11:47.916 --> 11:48.917
What accent?

11:49.960 --> 11:50.961
You want a Red Bull?

11:53.922 --> 11:54.923
Thanks.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.009
When, uh... When was this taken?

11:57.469 --> 11:58.469
Few years ago.

11:59.262 --> 12:01.473
Really? You just...
You look so young in it.

12:02.056 --> 12:04.934
Wow. Look at that.
Don't be smart guy.

12:05.310 --> 12:07.559
- Oh, sorry man...
- Why don't you sit down, relax.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.937
Yeah, yeah, no. That was...
my bad. I didn't mean to...

12:09.939 --> 12:11.983
- Looking all my stuff.
- Yeah.

12:12.650 --> 12:14.317
- Sorry.
- A little bit nosy guy.

12:14.319 --> 12:15.319
Yeah.

12:23.411 --> 12:25.830
Uh... so, wh... H... How did you
get into acting?

12:26.830 --> 12:29.500
Oh. It always been dream.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.503
- Long time.
- Yeah?

12:32.295 --> 12:33.296
But I ignore it.

12:33.671 --> 12:35.712
Then one day
I get into accident.

12:35.714 --> 12:36.463
What happened?

12:36.465 --> 12:38.591
Guy run red light, and smash.

12:38.593 --> 12:40.386
- Wow.
- Very bad for Tommy.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.179
- Wow.
- I almost die.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.849
- But then I survive.
- Wow.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.433
It was like wake-up call,
you could say.

12:47.435 --> 12:48.435
Yeah, definitely.

12:49.354 --> 12:51.020
After that I stopped doing
all the other things,

12:51.022 --> 12:54.148
and I go back to my dream.

12:54.150 --> 12:57.985
And everybody say, "You such
crazy guy. So stupid guy."

12:57.987 --> 13:00.362
I say, "I don't care. I do it."

13:00.364 --> 13:01.863
- Yes.
- I know I can do it.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.535
I get that. With me, everything
changed with Home Alone.

13:05.661 --> 13:08.330
Oh. You, you're home
alone long time?

13:09.373 --> 13:11.958
Uh, uh, the, the movie.
The movie Home Alone.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.210
- Oh, it's movie.
- Yeah.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.380
- With Macaulay Culkin.
- Okay.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.506
Okay, um... Yeah, so, um,
anyways, that movie,

13:19.508 --> 13:20.924
it... it spoke to me, you know?

13:20.926 --> 13:23.052
It, it changed my life and,

13:23.054 --> 13:25.304
and ever since then I just,
I have...

13:25.306 --> 13:26.391
- Nev...
- I get it.

13:26.891 --> 13:28.226
You want to be star.

13:29.477 --> 13:32.727
Yeah, I've... I just wanted
to be in the movies.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.691
You know, Greg,
you and me, we are the same.

13:36.567 --> 13:37.943
Oh, yeah? How's, how's that?

13:39.487 --> 13:40.572
We both have this dream.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.155
Yeah. I guess we do.

13:43.157 --> 13:47.579
And, for your information,
I was home alone too.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.748
Except not movie,
in real life.

13:55.670 --> 13:56.919
Don't I buy you
everything you want?

13:56.921 --> 13:59.756
A bicycle, you get
a bicycle. A car.

13:59.758 --> 14:01.549
- You buy me many things.
- No, no, no.

14:01.551 --> 14:03.550
- He bought me many things.
- We're not just buying things.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.635
We give you love
and affection, don't we?

14:05.637 --> 14:06.971
It's not a place for kids!

14:06.973 --> 14:09.222
A minute ago you said
you didn't care if he drinks.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.101
He said a little drink.

14:11.393 --> 14:14.352
You're tearing me apart!

14:14.354 --> 14:15.688
Oh, my God.

14:15.690 --> 14:18.607
You, you say one thing,
he says another and everybody...

14:18.609 --> 14:19.985
He's the best, I told you.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.943
You're taking me apart.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.946
Tearing. You're tearing
me apart.

14:23.948 --> 14:25.492
Yeah, he's emotion.

14:25.783 --> 14:28.867
- Moment to moment. Not plastic.
- I knew you'd like it, man.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.620
You know, you could
be like Dean.

14:30.622 --> 14:31.453
Me?

14:31.455 --> 14:33.622
My God, you're behind
the schedule.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.290
Listen to me, young man,

14:35.292 --> 14:37.418
you have the gift,
you have the looks.

14:37.420 --> 14:40.379
Yeah. Hey, if I can have
a career in this business,

14:40.381 --> 14:41.547
so can you, man.

14:41.549 --> 14:45.550
- Uh... I don't want career.
- You don't want a career?

14:45.552 --> 14:47.312
- I thought that's...
- I want my own planet.

14:47.931 --> 14:49.179
Uh, your own planet?

14:49.181 --> 14:51.015
Yeah it's cool. Everybody love
each other.

14:51.017 --> 14:53.266
That's why it's the best planet.

14:53.268 --> 14:55.310
Sounds great.
Sounds ideal, really.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.872
I have a present for you.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.981
Welcome to my planet, Greg.

14:58.983 --> 15:02.318
Oh, my God.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.319
Yeah, yeah.
Rebel Without A Cause,

15:04.321 --> 15:06.655
East of Eden, and Giant.
That's it.

15:06.657 --> 15:07.656
- Wow.
- Yeah.

15:07.658 --> 15:10.160
Three movies,
then all of a sudden he's dead.

15:10.578 --> 15:11.910
- That's so crazy.
- Yeah.

15:11.912 --> 15:12.912
- Tragedy.
- It is.

15:13.873 --> 15:15.581
You know, he died
just a little bit south of here.

15:15.583 --> 15:16.540
I wanna go one day,
to the crash site.

15:16.542 --> 15:17.542
Pay my respects.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.461
Why don't we go now?

15:19.838 --> 15:21.920
Now? No, Tommy,
it's not that close.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.131
It's like 300 miles away.

15:23.133 --> 15:25.757
300 mile, who care?
We just do it.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.052
It would take hours, man.

15:27.429 --> 15:29.846
Okay. Then you drive.

15:29.848 --> 15:30.848
What?

15:31.599 --> 15:33.433
- Tommy, are you serious?
- Yeah I'm serious.

15:33.435 --> 15:36.688
Greg, the Dean won't go to you.
You have to go to the Dean.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.857
All right, fuck it. All right.
Let's do this shit.

15:41.859 --> 15:44.153
- Road trip!
- Road trip!

15:46.321 --> 15:49.032
I'll miss him. Very much.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.326
His whole life people tell him,

15:51.703 --> 15:53.543
"You're not good enough.
You'll never make it."

15:53.872 --> 15:55.915
- But he doesn't listen.
- He show them all.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.209
That'll be us one day, Greg.

15:59.502 --> 16:02.294
I... I... I hope we're not dead
on the side of a road.

16:02.296 --> 16:05.758
No, not that part.
That we be famous.

16:06.301 --> 16:08.386
We'll show them. You'll see.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.513
- Yeah, maybe.
- No, Greg, listen.

16:12.891 --> 16:14.892
- Give me pinky.
- What?

16:15.185 --> 16:18.104
- What are we, ten years old?
- We pinky swear.

16:19.189 --> 16:21.858
Right here, right now.
We make pact.

16:22.859 --> 16:25.067
That we always push each other,

16:25.069 --> 16:28.905
that we always
believe in each other,

16:28.907 --> 16:30.908
and that we will
never forget dream.

16:33.203 --> 16:34.203
All right.

16:35.205 --> 16:36.913
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:39.209 --> 16:43.086
- Woo! James Dean!
- Oh, we miss you, James!

16:43.088 --> 16:45.295
We with you, brother, always!

16:54.306 --> 16:56.432
I think it about us, huh?

16:56.434 --> 16:57.933
Maybe.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.227
Yeah, maybe.

17:00.229 --> 17:01.940
You know, Greg,
I've been thinking.

17:02.690 --> 17:04.400
We should move to Los Angeles.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.652
Really. It where
everything happening.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.487
Yeah, I fucking wish.

17:09.196 --> 17:10.946
- So, why not?
- Um...

17:10.949 --> 17:13.284
For one, I, I can't afford it.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.453
It not problem.
We just go stay at my place.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.371
Wait, wait. You have
a place in LA?

17:19.373 --> 17:21.540
Yeah. I have
apartment I rarely use.

17:21.542 --> 17:22.960
We can go there together.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.294
Wait, Tommy,
you have an apartment

17:26.296 --> 17:28.256
in LA and San Francisco?

17:28.258 --> 17:29.172
- Yeah...
- How,

17:29.174 --> 17:31.300
how do you afford that? Wh...

17:31.302 --> 17:33.763
Greg, money not issue.
I told you.

17:35.140 --> 17:37.305
Tommy, are you...
You're being serious right now?

17:37.307 --> 17:38.475
Yes, Greg.

17:38.977 --> 17:39.978
But the real question,

17:41.563 --> 17:42.563
are you serious?

17:43.148 --> 17:47.608
Yes. Let's do this!

17:47.610 --> 17:50.447
- All right! Roommates.
- Roommates.

17:51.655 --> 17:55.534
Yeah, I see you smiling,
Baby Face. It's gonna be great.

18:05.836 --> 18:06.836
Greg!

18:08.172 --> 18:11.342
Greg, Greg, have you
lost your mind?

18:11.968 --> 18:13.717
What... You're leaving now?

18:13.719 --> 18:16.804
- Yeah.
- No. No. This is absurd.

18:16.806 --> 18:19.181
You can't just pack up
and move to Los Angeles.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.557
What are you gonna do for money?

18:20.559 --> 18:23.186
I have money saved
from my modeling jobs.

18:23.188 --> 18:24.187
From your mod...

18:24.189 --> 18:26.022
That money's gonna
last you two weeks.

18:26.024 --> 18:26.980
Then what are you gonna do?

18:26.982 --> 18:28.690
Then I'll get a job or...

18:28.692 --> 18:30.150
I don't know,
but I'll figure it out.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.777
What about this Tommy person?

18:31.779 --> 18:33.696
You barely know this guy, you're
moving in with him?

18:33.698 --> 18:36.364
He's being a good friend.
He's just looking out for me.

18:36.366 --> 18:37.576
Oh, my God. Greg.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.621
Do you... Do you
understand how hard it is?

18:42.623 --> 18:44.498
This acting thing?

18:44.500 --> 18:48.046
You don't just show up in LA
and things happen.

18:48.546 --> 18:49.629
It doesn't work like that.

18:49.631 --> 18:52.547
You have to know people.
You have to be very lucky.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.883
You have to work really hard.

18:54.885 --> 18:55.928
You have to be talented.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.265
I... I didn't mean it like that.

19:00.642 --> 19:02.602
Oh, my God.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.398
- Okay. Good.
- What are... Mom!

19:09.400 --> 19:11.025
- No, I'm gonna meet Tommy.
- No, no, no, no, no. Mom.

19:11.027 --> 19:12.067
- Please, you don't... Why? Why?
- I'm gonna meet your little,

19:12.069 --> 19:13.361
your little friend Tommy.
This is gonna be good.

19:13.363 --> 19:14.946
- Come on.
- Hello! Hi!

19:14.948 --> 19:17.073
- Hi!
- Why is he driving a Mercedes?

19:17.075 --> 19:19.285
- It's complicated.
- Greg, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:20.077 --> 19:22.745
I have an idea, why don't you
guys come in for a second,

19:22.747 --> 19:24.705
and we'll get to know each other
a little bit.

19:24.707 --> 19:26.498
- We can't.
- We don't have time, Mom.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.499
You're on a schedule?

19:27.501 --> 19:28.750
Mom, just come
give me a hug, please.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.503
Just a second. Just a second.
Just a second. Just a second.

19:30.505 --> 19:34.258
It's quite a fancy car you
have here, Tommy. Wow.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.969
Wow. How...

19:37.594 --> 19:38.844
How old are you?

19:38.846 --> 19:39.679
- Wow, what a question, my God.
- That's a personal question,

19:39.681 --> 19:41.221
you can't ask people
that question.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.890
- Don't worry, I'm Greg age.
- You're 19?

19:43.892 --> 19:44.892
Yeah.

19:45.394 --> 19:46.811
I just turned 14.

19:46.813 --> 19:48.187
Wow. Happy birthday.

19:48.189 --> 19:50.148
Okay, Tommy, what is it about

19:50.150 --> 19:53.109
my son that you find so
intriguing?

19:53.111 --> 19:55.613
No big deal. Baby Face cool guy.

19:55.947 --> 19:58.072
- Baby Face.
- Okay, all right, Mom.

19:58.074 --> 19:58.989
- Baby Face?
- It's a long drive.

19:58.991 --> 20:00.073
Oh, my God.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.034
Look at me. It's gonna be fine.

20:02.036 --> 20:03.078
It'll be fine.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.960
I'm gonna call you
right when I get in, okay?

20:09.960 --> 20:10.918
She crazy.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.630
What?
Tommy, shut up.

20:15.717 --> 20:16.923
Wow.

20:26.811 --> 20:29.687
See? Almost to Los Angeles.

20:29.689 --> 20:31.190
Oh, shit!

20:48.583 --> 20:49.667
Home sweet home.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.506
It's not castle, but it's okay.

20:57.342 --> 20:58.676
Just my pied-à-terre.

20:59.594 --> 21:01.845
- It's perfect, man.
- Yeah.

21:03.515 --> 21:05.850
Is it, um, just the one bedroom?

21:07.977 --> 21:09.377
You don't want to
share bed with me?

21:10.604 --> 21:11.689
Uh, um...

21:12.106 --> 21:14.483
I just joking.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.402
Oh, my God.
You should've seen your face.

21:17.778 --> 21:19.821
Yeah, you got me.

21:19.823 --> 21:22.448
- Don't worry. You take bedroom.
- No. No, Tommy, no.

21:22.450 --> 21:24.449
I just maybe put up some curtain

21:24.451 --> 21:26.284
and make little room in
corner or something.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.786
No, Tommy. No way.
I'll just take the couch.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.037
This is great, I swear.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.413
No, no. I insist.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.836
I want you to be my guest.
Like Beauty and Beast.

21:34.379 --> 21:36.086
I will be Beauty, of course.

21:36.088 --> 21:37.295
Of course.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.008
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.
- Ah, man.

21:39.508 --> 21:41.188
Man, you've had this place
this whole time?

21:41.469 --> 21:44.514
Yeah. I... I had it
several years now.

21:45.056 --> 21:46.430
And, and, you've never
wanted to like,

21:46.432 --> 21:47.556
move down here yourself

Wow, you got agent, Greg.
It's celebration.

24:31.639 --> 24:33.389
So, you must

What do you mean?

24:34.558 --> 24:35.975

24:35.977 --> 24:38.143
How to become big star,
like you.

24:38.145 --> 24:40.563
Big star? Tommy, I'm not a star.

24:40.565 --> 24:43.940
Okay. So modest, this guy.
Come on, you're on your way.

24:43.942 --> 24:44.900
All right,

24:47.071 --> 24:49.112
But that's kinda

You already have agent, right?

24:50.200 --> 24:51.114
Yeah.

24:51.116 --> 24:53.242
Okay, so you just tell 'agent

Am I hearing an accent?

26:37.431 --> 26:39.181
Uh, no, no. What do you mean?

26:39.183 --> 26:42.017
Because I'm hearing kind of
an Eastern European accent.

26:42.019 --> 26:44.187
No, that is, uh, that's from
New Orleans.

26:44.189 --> 26:45.021

26:50.527 --> 26:52.820

know what you were saying.

26:52.822 --> 26:54.404
- Okay. Yeah, well...

26:54.406 --> 26:55.531

27:32.319 --> 27:33.862

27:34.404 --> 27:36.738
You're way more

Okay. Well, I don't

27:51.588 --> 27:52.588
I'm very busy right now.

27:52.590 --> 27:54.256
I have to change
really quickly and go.

27:54.258 --> 27:55.925
Okay. Is everything all right?

You heard of
Konstantin Stanislavski?

Of course, yeah. He's, like,

28:01.432 --> 28:03.265

28:10.441 --> 28:12.109
So I have first class
this evening.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.778
I'm pretty sure
Stanislavski is dead.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.613
No, he not dead.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.615
I just speak to him,
for your information.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.325
What you think
I speak to, ghost?

28:22.327 --> 28:24.077
- No.

28:24.079 --> 28:25.621
Maybe ghost real,
but I can't talk to them.

28:25.623 --> 28:27.747

28:57.697 --> 28:59.488
Yeah. I know what a sonnet is.

28:59.490 --> 29:01.073
But, I think what I'm asking is,

29:01.075 --> 29:05.202

to do that, here?

29:05.204 --> 29:06.661

29:08.665 --> 29:11.126
- Yeah, I see myself.
- This is... No offense.

29:11.502 --> 29:14.169
You have a malevolent,
uh, presence.

29:14.171 --> 29:16.007
You are a perfect villain.

29:16.841 --> 29:17.798
I'm not scary guy.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.301
I can see you as Dracula,
Frankenstein.

29:20.303 --> 29:22.386
I'm not Frankenstein.

29:22.388 --> 29:25.848
I'm trying to give you
a shortcut to success.

29:25.850 --> 29:27.682
Keep your shortcut
in your pocket.

29:27.684 --> 29:29.185
Have you read any Shakespeare?

29:29.187 --> 29:30.227
I know all Shakespeare.

29:30.229 --> 29:31.689

29:36.527 --> 29:38.570
No. He's the ogre that
guards the island.

29:39.363 --> 29:41.154
What's this ogre?

29:41.156 --> 29:43.492
Ogre. I am hero.

29:44.451 --> 29:47.702
And you all are villain.

29:47.704 --> 29:50.497

Okay. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

Dude, it's been a fucking year.
You know what I mean? Like...

30:03.011 --> 30:06.889
I did this HBO thing,
where I'm like, the second lead.

30:06.891 --> 30:08.056
Things be going crazy.

30:08.058 --> 30:09.225
Yeah, no, it seems that way.

30:09.227 --> 30:10.642
This is where shit fucking...

30:10.644 --> 30:12.144
Yeah, no. You're gonna
take off after this.

30:12.146 --> 30:13.187
This is like...

30:13.189 --> 30:15.230
You're going. That's...

30:15.232 --> 30:16.399
You know, I'm happy for you.

30:16.401 --> 30:18.316
- What about you, though?
- I've been good.

30:18.318 --> 30:19.235
Been working?

30:19.237 --> 30:20.236
I don't know.

30:20.238 --> 30:21.862
My agents are saying
it's kinda like

30:21.864 --> 30:22.988
slow season or whatever. But...

30:22.990 --> 30:25.115
No. There's never a slow season.

30:25.117 --> 30:26.993
It's always shit working.

30:26.995 --> 30:28.910
Do you, like,
call your agents every day?

30:28.912 --> 30:30.121
Yeah, I mean...

30:30.123 --> 30:32.915
Where you start, fire that
fucking spooky friend of yours.

30:32.917 --> 30:35.584
That fucking vampire-looking
motherfucker.

30:35.586 --> 30:36.627
It's like... Who is he?

30:36.629 --> 30:38.086
He's just, I don't know.
He's a friend.

30:38.088 --> 30:38.963
- He's my roommate.
- 'Cause he's fucking...

30:38.965 --> 30:40.631
You can't go anywhere
with that dude.

30:40.633 --> 30:43.467
Hollywood's pussy dries up
when you walk in with this dude.

30:45.388 --> 30:46.823
They just fucking clamp shut
like a fucking...

30:46.847 --> 30:48.724
Hollywood puts on
a fucking chastity belt.

30:50.226 --> 30:51.936
Did you see the new,
uh, Star Wars?

30:59.611 --> 31:01.276
I kinda went for the
Jar Jar Binks thing.

31:01.278 --> 31:02.778
It's pretty funny.

31:02.780 --> 31:05.864
And, well, you know. It doesn't
really get you that far.

31:05.866 --> 31:07.742
It's like too much action.
Like, it never stops.

31:07.744 --> 31:08.784
There's no story.

31:08.786 --> 31:10.287
And it makes me pass out.

31:10.913 --> 31:12.913
A couple friends of mine
went and saw it recently.

31:12.915 --> 31:13.915
Hi.

31:14.875 --> 31:18.377
You big Hollywood producer,
right? I see you on TV.

31:18.379 --> 31:19.961
Ah, yeah. How are you?
Nice to see you.

31:19.963 --> 31:21.881
Tommy Wiseau. Hi.

31:21.883 --> 31:24.009
- Nice to meet you, thank you.
- Hi, young lady.

31:24.302 --> 31:26.009
- Okay...
- I don't want to bullshit.

31:26.011 --> 31:27.637
I don't want to do none
of the bullshit.

31:27.639 --> 31:29.805
I'm very talented,

31:29.807 --> 31:31.349
and I have many good ideas.

31:31.351 --> 31:32.351
We're having dinner.

31:33.311 --> 31:34.602
Okay? You don't walk up
to people's table and do this.

31:34.604 --> 31:36.187
That's not how it works
in this business, okay?

31:36.189 --> 31:37.647
Which way? Tell me how do it.

31:37.649 --> 31:39.856
You can call my agency,
United Talent,

31:39.858 --> 31:43.401
send your resume to United Talent
Agency, to David Krammer...

31:43.403 --> 31:46.324
- Okay, I show you, okay.
- All right.

31:47.325 --> 31:50.495
To be, or not to be.

31:50.953 --> 31:52.830
That is the question.

31:53.331 --> 31:58.750
Whether nobler in mind
to suffer sling and arrow...

31:58.752 --> 32:00.504
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to stop that.

32:00.838 --> 32:01.670
Is this gentleman
bothering you?

32:01.672 --> 32:02.839
What the fuck do you think?

32:02.841 --> 32:05.081
- You don't like Shakespeare?
- Sir, I need you to leave.

32:05.343 --> 32:06.758
Okay, I do
the Tennessee Williams.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.428
I don't want Tennessee Williams,
I don't want Shakespeare.

32:08.430 --> 32:10.554
- Stella!
- Okay! Now we're getting...

32:10.556 --> 32:12.473
- Security. Security, no.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:12.475 --> 32:14.227
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to leave, right now.

32:15.437 --> 32:17.354
Come here. Tommy...

32:18.648 --> 32:22.235
Just because you want it
doesn't mean it can happen.

32:22.610 --> 32:24.694
Okay? It's one in a million,

32:24.696 --> 32:27.028
even if you have
Brando's talent.

32:27.030 --> 32:29.200
It's not gonna
happen for you, okay?

32:29.992 --> 32:32.784
- But now you have to go.
- Well, maybe I could... Maybe...

32:32.786 --> 32:36.665
I'm not saying maybe. I'm
saying not in a million years.

32:37.709 --> 32:40.003
- But after that?
- And not after.

32:42.546 --> 32:44.548
- I'm sorry.
- I accept your apology.

32:45.216 --> 32:47.007
I'm sorry, sir.
Is everything okay now?

32:47.009 --> 32:48.092
Yeah. Thanks for rushing over.

32:48.094 --> 32:50.094
He made it through two fucking
acts of Shakespeare.

33:19.709 --> 33:20.709
Tommy?

33:26.423 --> 33:27.423
Tommy.

33:48.278 --> 33:49.278
Tommy.

33:59.414 --> 34:00.457
Tommy, you okay?

34:09.257 --> 34:11.510
- You think I'm villain?
- What?

34:12.637 --> 34:16.099
This town, Greg...
They don't want me.

34:17.599 --> 34:19.268
They don't understand me.
They...

34:22.271 --> 34:23.856
Maybe I don't have what it take.

34:25.733 --> 34:27.485
Yeah man. I know what you mean.

34:28.152 --> 34:29.612
- You do?
- Yeah.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.322
My agent won't return
my calls and...

34:33.282 --> 34:36.324
All I hear is no, all day,
every day. It's...

34:36.327 --> 34:37.996
It's fucking hard, man.

34:41.206 --> 34:42.666
Nobody like me, Greg.

34:45.503 --> 34:46.795
Nobody give me chance.

34:48.338 --> 34:49.338
My whole life.

34:52.635 --> 34:54.679
But... Hey.
We can't give up, right?

34:59.516 --> 35:01.143
Maybe not worth it, Greg.

35:01.978 --> 35:03.396
No, hey. Tommy, look at me.

35:04.188 --> 35:05.188
Look at me.

35:07.691 --> 35:09.441
When they told James Dean
he wasn't good enough,

35:09.443 --> 35:10.487
did he listen to them?

35:12.197 --> 35:13.363
- No.
- No.

35:13.697 --> 35:16.032
No. Fuck that, all right?
He kept fighting,

35:16.034 --> 35:17.950
and he showed them all.

35:17.952 --> 35:19.192
And that's what we're gonna do.

35:22.123 --> 35:23.123
Remember?

35:23.999 --> 35:25.499
All right, we said we were
gonna push each other.

35:25.501 --> 35:27.420
Never give up on
our dreams, right?

35:29.171 --> 35:30.171
Come on.

35:36.012 --> 35:37.555
I just don't know how, Greg.

35:40.516 --> 35:42.059
Wish we could just
make our own movie.

35:50.318 --> 35:51.694
That great idea.

35:52.570 --> 35:54.028
It'll be great drama.

35:54.030 --> 35:55.406
Like the Tennessee Williams.

35:56.074 --> 35:59.242
So there this guy Johnny.
A true American hero.

35:59.244 --> 36:00.409
To be played by me.

36:00.411 --> 36:01.704
He has it all.

36:02.079 --> 36:04.747
Good look, good job,
many friends.

36:04.749 --> 36:07.919
Greg, how long is movie script?

36:08.836 --> 36:11.921
And then this girl,
this beautiful girl,

36:11.923 --> 36:13.840
she betray him.

36:13.842 --> 36:16.594
But then this Lisa
sleep with best friend.

36:16.927 --> 36:18.470
We call best friend Mark.

36:19.179 --> 36:22.141
After Mark Damon from
Talented Ripley Man.

36:23.434 --> 36:26.436
And then this guy Johnny,
he go crazy.

36:28.606 --> 36:31.943
He decide to kill himself
in front of the world.

36:32.777 --> 36:34.735
And then he show them all.

36:34.737 --> 36:37.947
That's great.

36:37.949 --> 36:40.617
And also maybe
Johnny is vampire. We'll see.

36:40.952 --> 36:43.121
"Anything for my princess."

36:43.454 --> 36:45.954
After everything he do
for everybody,

36:45.956 --> 36:47.416
why would they do this to him?

36:48.376 --> 36:51.251
My mind! Can't think.

36:51.253 --> 36:53.296
"Two is nice,
but three a crowd."

36:53.298 --> 36:54.924
"Two is nice,
but three a crowd."

36:57.885 --> 37:01.472
But it's real life. People act
so strange these days.

37:08.979 --> 37:09.979
You finished.

37:11.148 --> 37:12.481
This my masterpiece.

37:12.483 --> 37:14.693
Greatest drama
since the Tennessee William.

37:16.112 --> 37:18.113
- The Room.
- The Room.

37:18.990 --> 37:20.158
Nobody read it yet.

37:21.117 --> 37:23.284
So today, you be first one.

37:23.286 --> 37:24.621
Yeah. All right.

37:27.831 --> 37:28.789
So read it.

37:28.791 --> 37:30.458
Oh, you want me to
read it right now?

37:30.460 --> 37:31.793
Yeah, what you think?

37:31.795 --> 37:33.505
Okay. The Room.

37:34.171 --> 37:36.130
I'll do anything for my girl.

37:36.132 --> 37:37.298
You should marry Johnny.

37:37.300 --> 37:39.844
Did you know that chocolate
is the symbol of love?

37:43.347 --> 37:44.722
We can't do this anymore.

37:44.724 --> 37:47.432
I keep thinking about your
strong hands around my body.

37:47.434 --> 37:49.184
Anyway, how's your sex life?

37:49.186 --> 37:50.519
I don't think she's
faithful to me.

37:50.521 --> 37:53.439
Life is complicated.
The unexpected happens.

37:53.441 --> 37:54.731
In a few minutes, bitch.

37:54.733 --> 37:56.441
If a lot of people
loved each other,

37:56.443 --> 37:59.029
the world would be a better
place to live.

38:04.369 --> 38:05.745
Done.

38:08.039 --> 38:09.040
Well what you think?

38:09.666 --> 38:11.706
I mean, it's great. That's...

38:11.708 --> 38:14.126
I just, I can't...
I can't believe it, man.

38:14.128 --> 38:15.461
You... You did this!

38:15.463 --> 38:17.048
And of course you play Mark.

38:17.340 --> 38:20.298
You, you want me
to play Mark in this?

38:20.300 --> 38:22.050
Hey, big role. Second lead.

38:22.052 --> 38:25.095
Well, yeah, it's a huge role.
Are you... Are you sure you...

38:25.097 --> 38:26.972
If you don't want to do it,
fine.

38:26.974 --> 38:28.724
Maybe Johnny Depp available.

38:28.726 --> 38:31.476
No, no, no. I want it.
I... I want the role.

38:31.478 --> 38:32.644
I'll take it.

38:32.646 --> 38:35.231
It's like you say,
Hollywood reject us,

38:35.233 --> 38:36.898
then we do it on our own.

38:36.900 --> 38:39.110
Wait, you...
You have the money to make this?

38:39.112 --> 38:40.613
I have. It's no problem.

38:42.072 --> 38:43.472
You're really gonna
make this thing?

38:43.574 --> 38:46.535
No, Greg. We are going to do it.

38:49.037 --> 38:50.037
Together.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.175
...and we're gonna have
everything you need.

39:02.177 --> 39:04.343
We have a vast
assortment of lenses.

39:04.345 --> 39:07.387
We've got cameras,
both digital and film.

39:07.389 --> 39:09.097
- Here's our facility owner.
- Hey, Bill.

39:09.099 --> 39:11.309
Come on over and meet
Tommy and Greg.

39:11.311 --> 39:12.894
These are the guys
I was telling you about.

39:12.896 --> 39:14.186
- Oh, hi.
- How you doing, man?

39:14.188 --> 39:15.228
Hey, pleasure to meet you.

39:16.023 --> 39:17.863
- How long is the shoot?
- As long as it takes.

39:17.941 --> 39:18.775
All right.

39:18.777 --> 39:21.235
We just wanna
make it right, you know?

39:21.237 --> 39:23.028
Well, I think you're
gonna find everything

39:23.030 --> 39:24.405
you need
here at Birns and Sawyer.

39:24.407 --> 39:25.822
Our rental packages
start at about...

39:25.824 --> 39:27.700
Wait, wait.
I stop you right there.

39:27.702 --> 39:29.746
- Okay.
- We don't rent. We buy.

39:31.956 --> 39:33.122
Is that not normal, or...

39:33.124 --> 39:34.581
Industry standard is pretty much
that you

39:34.583 --> 39:36.209
would rent the equipment

39:36.211 --> 39:38.836
because it's so prohibitively
expensive to own.

39:38.838 --> 39:40.465
Okay. I say no problem.

39:40.882 --> 39:42.758
Okay. I guess we'll buy.

39:43.133 --> 39:45.427
Wanna shoot 35 or HD?

39:45.804 --> 39:47.305
Well, we'll shoot
both on this film.

39:47.597 --> 39:49.305
Digital and film?

39:49.307 --> 39:53.184
But you'd need, twice the crew,
uh... twice the equipment,

39:53.186 --> 39:54.851
I mean, hell, both...

39:54.853 --> 39:56.854
They're lit differently.
It's just not done.

39:56.856 --> 39:58.898
- I have vision.
- Tommy's a pioneer, man.

39:58.900 --> 40:00.983
He, that's... He wants to go
outside the box.

40:00.985 --> 40:01.985
That's what he does.

40:03.487 --> 40:04.863
So what? We have deal or what?

40:05.155 --> 40:06.199
Uh, let us discuss...

40:07.282 --> 40:08.282
Yeah. Just give us a minute,
you know? It's just...

40:08.284 --> 40:09.992
You know, not normally
how we do business.

40:09.994 --> 40:11.996
- This is weird.
- Who buys equipment?

40:12.329 --> 40:13.496
Apparently this guy.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.164
I don't know
about this guy.

40:15.166 --> 40:16.039
Does he have the money?

40:16.041 --> 40:17.749
I don't know
if he has the money.

40:17.751 --> 40:20.211
We are a business, we sell
stuff, let's sell it to him.

40:20.213 --> 40:21.878
Okay. I have an idea.
Follow my lead.

40:21.880 --> 40:23.240
- What are you doing?
- Okay, okay.

40:24.175 --> 40:25.635
Okay. So...

40:28.345 --> 40:30.470
We are able to sell you
all the equipment you need.

40:30.472 --> 40:32.055
- Okay!
- There we go!

40:32.057 --> 40:32.974
Now you say yes.

40:32.976 --> 40:34.434
And we're also

40:34.436 --> 40:37.311
willing to give it to you
at a reduced rate,

40:37.313 --> 40:39.148
if you decide to shoot
here in our studio.

40:39.356 --> 40:41.816
- What do you think?
- We shoot here?

40:41.818 --> 40:43.985
Yeah. We want to be in business
with you, Tommy.

40:43.987 --> 40:46.865
Okay. We make American movie
with American discount.

40:47.657 --> 40:50.032
- Perfect.
- Okay. That's a deal, all right?

40:55.331 --> 40:57.206
- The character is Lisa.
- Okay. Is she...

40:57.208 --> 41:01.543
you know, like, romantic,
or a scientist, or...

41:01.545 --> 41:02.545
She's Lisa.

41:02.671 --> 41:04.838
- Okay.
- All right. Now we do scene.

41:04.840 --> 41:05.840
Okay.

41:06.842 --> 41:08.383
Okay, okay. Well, Johnny should
be here any minute.

41:08.385 --> 41:09.429
Now you're riding horse.

41:11.514 --> 41:13.849
Okay. Someone knock on door
while you're riding horse.

41:14.726 --> 41:15.682
Who is it?

41:15.684 --> 41:18.520
It's like rain. Like sexy rain.

41:18.854 --> 41:20.646
So, I just want to introduce you
to some people.

41:20.648 --> 41:23.026
Raphael, he's one
of our most experienced DPs.

41:23.568 --> 41:26.235
- Ah, Director of Photography
- Oh, right, DP.

41:26.237 --> 41:29.447
This is Sandy Schklair.
He's a script supervisor on...

41:29.449 --> 41:31.240
- How many, Sandy?
- Forty-seven shows.

41:31.242 --> 41:33.117
- Oh, wow. So many.
- Forty-seven.

41:33.119 --> 41:34.285
That's a lot of movies.

41:34.287 --> 41:36.206
- I'm Lisa.
- Oh, that like cowboy.

41:36.664 --> 41:39.584
- She... She's a bit of a cowboy?
- No. You do it like cowboy.

41:40.251 --> 41:41.291
I'm Lisa.

41:41.293 --> 41:43.211
I don't want cowboy.
You're do like cowboy.

41:43.213 --> 41:44.753
- Are you cowboy?
- No.

41:44.755 --> 41:46.421
Don't. Just do the
opposite of that.

41:46.423 --> 41:47.380
- Do the opp...
- Yeah, yeah.

41:47.382 --> 41:49.093
Okay. Now you're
playing saxophone.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.510
Am I still the cowboy?

41:51.512 --> 41:52.596
No. Just play saxophone.

41:54.057 --> 41:55.222
Amy does hair and makeup.

41:55.224 --> 41:57.015
This is Safoya.
She does costumes.

41:57.017 --> 41:58.978
What do you think,
my character dress like this?

41:59.436 --> 42:02.563
Um... Maybe we can get rid
of one of the belts.

42:02.565 --> 42:05.525
What? No. No way.
Make my butt look good.

42:05.527 --> 42:06.441
Okay!

42:06.443 --> 42:07.653
Pretend I'm boyfriend.

42:11.074 --> 42:12.450
And... what do you do?

42:12.699 --> 42:14.659
You remember Bill?
You know Bill. Come on.

42:14.661 --> 42:16.785
- I sold you the equipment.
- Yeah.

42:16.787 --> 42:18.914
- Right.
- Bill, I didn't know it was you.

42:19.541 --> 42:20.747
And action.

42:20.749 --> 42:21.874
I'm sorry, my darling.

42:21.876 --> 42:22.791
All right. No. Start it over.

42:22.793 --> 42:24.961
Do it like Shakespeare,
but sexy.

42:24.963 --> 42:25.963
Okay.

42:28.550 --> 42:32.760
- Good day, Mark. I misseth you.
- That was great!

42:32.762 --> 42:35.054
- Don't break character!
- Is Johnny there?

42:35.056 --> 42:36.680
Okay. Everybody hired.

42:36.682 --> 42:37.682
- Just like that?
- Yeah.

42:37.976 --> 42:39.182
- Okay.
- That was easy.

42:39.184 --> 42:41.269
You wanna, like, talk about
the vision of the movie, though?

42:41.271 --> 42:43.271
Don't worry. We have plenty of time.
We talk about all this.

42:43.273 --> 42:45.021
As the script supervisor,
it would be really helpful

42:45.023 --> 42:46.523
if I could look at the script
for the movie first.

42:46.525 --> 42:48.986
Everybody want script.
Don't be greedy, okay?

42:49.612 --> 42:51.236
What we do, it's a little
unconventional, and so...

42:51.238 --> 42:52.238
Okay.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.616
You're licking ice cream cone.

42:55.784 --> 42:57.827
Okay, but it's really hot out,
so it's melting.

42:57.829 --> 42:59.662
- Oh, okay.
- You have to lick it.

42:59.664 --> 43:00.999
You better lick fast.

43:01.458 --> 43:02.999
Oh, no.
But now it's like brain freeze.

43:03.001 --> 43:04.666
- Too much at once.
- Yeah. Get it all.

43:04.668 --> 43:06.251
Yeah, you gotta
throw it all in...

43:06.253 --> 43:07.711
Is this a real movie?

43:07.713 --> 43:09.130
- I really wanna be in a...
- No. I stop you.

43:09.132 --> 43:10.130
I don't make porno.

43:10.132 --> 43:11.590
- Okay.
- I just do ice cream.

43:11.592 --> 43:13.468
- I could try it again.
- No. Don't try it again.

43:13.470 --> 43:14.637
You know what, you're hired.

43:14.845 --> 43:16.720
- Aww, thank you so much!
- Okay!

43:45.876 --> 43:47.918
Okay. Everyone, gather around.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.378
Gather around, everyone.

43:49.380 --> 43:50.505
Come on, don't be shy.

43:50.507 --> 43:52.380
Everyone, come in.

43:52.382 --> 43:55.885
I need cast, crew, Marcus.
Marcus, come here.

43:55.887 --> 43:56.887
Get in here.

43:57.764 --> 44:01.182
This Marcus. He does video.
Behind scenes, okay?

44:01.184 --> 44:04.476
Get me now.
Face, and eyes and for speech.

44:04.478 --> 44:06.271
Yeah. Do some
movement and stuff.

44:06.731 --> 44:10.443
Okay! Today,
our top of mountain day.

44:11.485 --> 44:14.905
Today we take first steps
on a great journey.

44:15.365 --> 44:20.078
After today, which one of
ourselves will ever be same?

44:20.702 --> 44:24.541
This play work if chemistry
between character make sense.

44:25.249 --> 44:29.461
Human behavior. Betrayal.
It applies to all of us.

44:29.878 --> 44:31.088
It's in ourselves.

44:32.548 --> 44:35.259
You love someone, what is love?

44:35.760 --> 44:37.554
You need to have spirit. Hope.

44:38.345 --> 44:39.389
Be optimist.

44:39.597 --> 44:43.265
But can you handle
all your human behavior

44:43.267 --> 44:46.059
and behavior of others?

44:46.061 --> 44:48.646
Right? Right?
See what I'm saying?

44:48.648 --> 44:50.275
You don't wanna be good.

44:52.235 --> 44:53.235
We're gonna be great.

44:54.153 --> 44:58.447
Okay. I have one announcement.
This is bathroom.

44:58.449 --> 45:00.617
I spend many dollars on this.

45:00.869 --> 45:02.827
It's for me only.
Director only. Okay?

45:02.829 --> 45:04.787
You know there's, like,
a real bathroom

45:04.789 --> 45:07.039
with, like, doors and everything
right, right there.

45:07.041 --> 45:09.499
This real movie set here.
Real movie set.

45:09.501 --> 45:11.126
You know?
No Mickey Mouse stuff.

45:11.128 --> 45:12.336
Copy that.

45:12.338 --> 45:16.133
Okay. Enough pet talk.
We make movie. The Room.

45:16.967 --> 45:20.635
Yeah, The Room! Let's make a movie!

45:20.637 --> 45:22.637
Okay, let's see what you've
got set up over here.

45:22.639 --> 45:24.975
Great. We do alley scene.

45:25.142 --> 45:27.184
This set of the alleyway

45:27.186 --> 45:29.729
looks exactly like the real
alleyway out there.

45:29.731 --> 45:32.439
That's right. That's why we
doing Hollywood movie, right?

45:32.441 --> 45:34.201
Why don't we just shoot
in the real alleyway?

45:35.153 --> 45:36.780
Because it's real
Hollywood movie.

45:37.280 --> 45:38.863
- No, yeah, sounds good.
- Okay.

45:38.865 --> 45:41.532
We need other camera right now.
Right here next to this one.

45:41.534 --> 45:43.325
- Digital camera.
- Yeah. Sorry about that. Get the kit.

45:43.327 --> 45:44.661
Let's go, everybody. Come on.

45:45.287 --> 45:47.121

Denny and Chris R.

45:47.123 --> 45:48.831
What do I say?

45:48.833 --> 45:51.291
Okay. We go over lines.
Don't worry, don't worry.

45:51.293 --> 45:53.462
You deal with the light,
I deal with the actor, okay?

45:53.755 --> 45:54.586
All right, people.

45:54.588 --> 45:55.755
You play
basketball here.

45:55.757 --> 45:57.340
And this guy come over, Chris R.

45:57.342 --> 46:00.510

demand money, okay?

46:00.512 --> 46:03.847
Cock sucking motherfucker!
Five fucking minutes!

46:04.182 --> 46:05.264

46:05.266 --> 46:07.517
- Fuck you.
- You good? Any questions?

46:07.519 --> 46:10.477
Yeah. Uh... How, how old
is my character supposed to be?

46:10.479 --> 46:13.021
Like your age.
Like 15, 16 year old boy.

46:13.023 --> 46:14.523
I... I'm 26.

46:14.525 --> 46:16.191
Same thing, okay?
You look great.

46:16.193 --> 46:17.693
And, and, uh, sorry. Uh...

46:17.695 --> 46:19.361
Can I call him Chris
instead of Chris R?

46:19.363 --> 46:20.695
It's just, I don't know why...

46:20.697 --> 46:22.907
No. His name Chris R.
You call him Chris R.

46:22.909 --> 46:24.825
Cock sucking motherfucker!

46:24.827 --> 46:26.619
My God, this guy monster.

46:26.621 --> 46:28.373
- Fuck, fuck!

46:29.039 --> 46:31.543

Okay. Okay.

46:35.713 --> 46:37.006

Yeah. Sure you were.

46:55.066 --> 46:57.694

46:58.235 --> 46:59.903
I don't wanna play
some fucking HORSE.

47:00.655 --> 47:02.740
Where is my fucking money?

47:04.242 --> 47:05.907

"It's coming?"

47:08.246 --> 47:11.791
Just give me five minutes.

47:12.666 --> 47:14.752
Five minutes? You want five

Good job. All right.

47:50.579 --> 47:51.579
Action.

47:52.539 --> 47:53.997
Who do you think you are?
You're acting like a kid.

47:53.999 --> 47:55.833
- Just grow up.
- Hey, who you calling "kid"?

47:55.835 --> 47:57.435
Chill out, Mark.
I'm just trying to help.

47:57.628 --> 47:59.044
You're having an affair
with Lisa, aren't you?

47:59.046 --> 48:00.090
What?

48:01.257 --> 48:03.443
Okay, cut. Greg, come here.
I need to talk to you, okay?

48:03.467 --> 48:04.842
What's going on, man?

48:04.844 --> 48:06.802
- You gotta be aggressive.
- I know. I know.

48:06.804 --> 48:08.554
This is your moment.
Go to edge of your moment.

48:28.492 --> 48:30.284
You're acting like a kid.
Just grow up.

48:30.286 --> 48:31.494
Hey, who you calling "kid"?

48:31.496 --> 48:33.956
Look, chill out, Mark.

48:38.670 --> 48:40.001

48:50.389 --> 48:51.389

48:53.434 --> 48:55.018
Hello. How can I help you?

48:55.353 --> 48:58.313
I'd like to cash this check

Okay. Is, uh, 20s okay?

49:02.777 --> 49:04.320

49:05.530 --> 49:08.365
That is shocking.
There's actually money in there?

49:09.117 --> 49:10.867
This account?

49:10.869 --> 49:12.827
It's like a bottomless pit.

49:12.829 --> 49:13.952
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:13.954 --> 49:15.121

49:15.123 --> 49:16.622

Nah.

49:28.010 --> 49:29.135
More spray. More spray.

49:29.137 --> 49:30.343
You did a great job

49:30.345 --> 49:32.185

49:32.557 --> 49:35.852
Oh, hi. Oh, hi, Mark. Hi, Mark.

49:37.144 --> 49:38.353

49:38.563 --> 49:39.519
Hi, Greg.

49:39.521 --> 49:41.146
Dude, first day in front
of the camera.

49:41.148 --> 49:43.064
How are you feeling?
You excited? Nervous?

49:43.066 --> 49:45.276
Nervous? Why you say that?
I'm not nervous.

49:45.278 --> 49:46.278
Oh, no. Um...

49:46.653 --> 49:47.778
- Hi Mark.
- Oh, just, um...

49:47.780 --> 49:49.363
Man, before my first scene
I was like...

49:49.365 --> 49:51.448
- I almost threw up. And it was...
- You think I'm nervous?

49:51.450 --> 49:53.409
- Not at all, not at all. I just-
- Who says I'm nervous?

49:53.411 --> 49:55.160
Fine. More spray.

49:55.162 --> 49:57.412
- It's gonna look really wet.
- No. It's gonna look good.

49:57.414 --> 49:59.208
It look good.
I know how it look.

49:59.416 --> 50:01.459
Just wanna say good luck, man.
You're gonna do great.

50:01.461 --> 50:03.755
Guys. Uh... We're five minutes
away from shooting.

50:03.921 --> 50:05.588
- Great scene yesterday.
- Thanks.

50:05.590 --> 50:07.090
Whatever, you do great
scene yesterday.

50:07.092 --> 50:09.342
Maybe you think I don't
do great scene.

50:09.344 --> 50:11.595
- Tommy, not at all.
- Where wardrobe girl?

50:11.929 --> 50:14.347
- I'm sure she's...
- Where wardrobe girl?

50:14.349 --> 50:15.264
Right here. Right here.

50:15.266 --> 50:17.224

I been looking all over.

50:17.226 --> 50:18.476
I just went to get ties.

50:18.478 --> 50:21.061
We're ready now. Too late.
Already dressed.

50:21.063 --> 50:22.479
But none of that matches. I...

50:22.481 --> 50:24.356
Look, it's his first day under the camera.
He's just nervous.

50:24.358 --> 50:26.566
Don't talk about me,
Greg, I hear you.

50:26.568 --> 50:27.401
Okay, sorry.

50:27.403 --> 50:29.113
I have ears,
for your information.

50:29.572 --> 50:31.405
Are you gonna film with all that
stuff in your pocket?

50:31.407 --> 50:32.825
I keep my stuff, sweetie.

50:33.952 --> 50:36.327
Okay. Can I at least take
a photo for continuity?

50:36.329 --> 50:37.912
Continuity in your forehead.

50:37.914 --> 50:40.331
- What does that even mean?
- Don't take it personally.

50:40.333 --> 50:41.331
He's in a crazy space.

50:41.333 --> 50:42.959
We're gonna need
five more minutes for lighting.

50:42.961 --> 50:43.961
No. I'm ready now!

50:44.461 --> 50:46.921
Let's go. Let's go,

50:56.599 --> 50:58.309
What line? What is line?

50:59.476 --> 51:02.477
I did not hit her.
It's not true. It's bullshit.

51:02.479 --> 51:05.441
I did not hit her.
I did not. Oh, hi, Mark.

51:05.650 --> 51:06.650
'Kay.

51:09.987 --> 51:10.987
Action.

51:15.659 --> 51:16.659
What is line?

51:18.454 --> 51:21.372
I did not hit her.
It's not true. It's bullshit.

51:21.374 --> 51:23.835
I did not hit her. I did not.
Oh, hi, Mark.

51:30.007 --> 51:34.302

Okay. Okay. Line?

51:38.516 --> 51:39.974

51:39.976 --> 51:42.769
It's not true. It's bullshit.

51:42.771 --> 51:47.606
I did not hit her. I did not.
Oh, hi, Mark.

51:47.608 --> 51:49.568
Take 17. Action.

51:50.862 --> 51:51.860
I hit her.

51:51.862 --> 51:53.653
No! Do you want to
change the line?

51:53.655 --> 51:55.405
Script is script.
Script stays same.

51:55.407 --> 51:57.867
You're doing great, man.
We'll get there.

51:57.869 --> 52:01.871
Action. Action. Action! Action!

52:01.873 --> 52:04.374
You have to say it loud.
I can't hear you in here.

52:05.710 --> 52:07.878
- Say "Action" so I can hear.
- Okay.

52:09.296 --> 52:10.340
Action!

52:11.715 --> 52:15.300
I did not hit her.
It's not true. It's bullshit.

52:15.302 --> 52:19.639
I did not hit her. I did not.
Oh, hi, Mark.

52:19.641 --> 52:20.932
What the f...
Where are you looking?

52:20.934 --> 52:23.061
It doesn't work
if you're looking at the camera.

52:23.394 --> 52:26.773
- What?
- Take 67. Action.

52:27.981 --> 52:30.358
It's not true. I did not
hit her. It's bullshit...

52:34.072 --> 52:37.282
All right. I'm gonna fucking...
try something. I don't know.

52:38.242 --> 52:39.992
- Fuck!
- Hey, hey, hey.

52:39.994 --> 52:41.077
- What?
- Okay, um...

52:41.079 --> 52:42.327
Maybe, maybe just use this.

52:42.329 --> 52:43.496
You know, I think it'll help you
take your mind off...

52:43.498 --> 52:45.164
- Water bottle?
- Hey, listen, listen.

52:45.166 --> 52:46.581
What do you always say
to me, all right?

52:46.583 --> 52:48.584
Intensity. Show emotion.
Throw it.

52:48.586 --> 52:49.876
Do something crazy.
Use the bottle.

52:49.878 --> 52:50.963
- Oh, show emotion.
- Yes.

52:51.505 --> 52:52.755
That's easy part.

52:52.757 --> 52:54.215
Why don't you say
that to me before, Greg?

52:54.217 --> 52:56.377
- I don't know. I didn't...
- You see, Greg...

52:56.885 --> 52:58.260
These other guys,
these other people,

52:58.262 --> 53:00.345
they don't care like you care,
you know?

53:00.347 --> 53:01.972
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay. We do this together.

53:01.974 --> 53:04.435
- Me and you, man. You got this.
- Show emotion.

53:04.686 --> 53:06.563
- Okay. I do it.
- Okay. All right.

53:06.896 --> 53:08.815
- All right.
- All right, let's see.

53:09.273 --> 53:11.483
Oh, we got a bottle now.
Look out.

53:12.527 --> 53:13.527
Action!

53:14.445 --> 53:17.195
I did not hit her.
It's not true. It's bullshit.

53:17.197 --> 53:19.615
I did not hit her. I did not!

53:19.617 --> 53:22.162
Oh, hi, Mark.

53:27.458 --> 53:28.667
I got it!

53:33.798 --> 53:36.301
- We got that?
- Okay. Moving on now.

53:37.885 --> 53:38.885
Hey, babe.

53:39.429 --> 53:40.429
Hey.

53:43.599 --> 53:44.599
Babe!

53:45.769 --> 53:47.434
Wanna take a break?

53:47.436 --> 53:49.394
- Um...
- How's it going?

53:49.396 --> 53:50.481
Are you feeling good?

53:50.981 --> 53:54.818
I am. I am. Yeah.
Feels like it's coming together.

53:55.445 --> 53:56.693
- Good.
- Yeah.

53:56.695 --> 53:57.820
Tommy is...

53:57.822 --> 53:59.613
- Tommy is...
- Settling.

53:59.615 --> 54:01.323
Yeah. He's, he's stressed.

54:01.325 --> 54:03.492
You know?
He, he did his first scene,

54:03.494 --> 54:05.577
which, uh, took a million takes.

54:05.579 --> 54:06.829
But, oh, acting it.

54:06.831 --> 54:08.789
But, you know, he's, he's,
the director too.

54:08.791 --> 54:09.624
And so that's like...

54:09.626 --> 54:10.624
It's a lot.
A lot to think about.

54:10.626 --> 54:12.501
Acting, directing, producing.

54:12.503 --> 54:14.796
So he's doing, he's doing great.
He'll get there.

54:14.798 --> 54:15.798
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:16.632 --> 54:20.552
What do you do if it
turns out really bad?

54:21.345 --> 54:23.805
- Like...
- It's not gonna be bad.

54:23.807 --> 54:25.975
Like, if it turns out terrible.

54:26.266 --> 54:27.474
- Would you, can you...
- That would, that would...

54:27.476 --> 54:30.186
- ...take it off your IMDB?
- ...suck but...

54:30.188 --> 54:31.854
But it feels good.
It feels good.

54:31.856 --> 54:33.564
And it's, like, you know
when it's working or not,

54:33.566 --> 54:35.733
and it's, it's really working.

54:35.735 --> 54:36.735
- Good.
- Yeah.

54:38.320 --> 54:41.031
I used to know a girl,
she had a dozen guys.

54:41.699 --> 54:43.740
One of them found out about it,
beat her up so bad

54:43.742 --> 54:45.700
she ended up in a hospital
on Guerrero Street.

54:47.037 --> 54:48.914
- What a story, Mark.
- Cut.

54:50.791 --> 54:51.999
Why is he laughing?

54:52.001 --> 54:53.459
- I have no idea.
- Weird time to laugh.

54:53.461 --> 54:54.376
Uh...

54:54.378 --> 54:56.711
Why don't we go one
more time, and uh,

54:56.713 --> 54:59.173
let's just get a different
reaction to the story, okay?

54:59.175 --> 55:02.050
Uh... Let's uh, let's roll
with tail slate.

55:02.052 --> 55:03.292
- Rolling.
- Okay.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.095
- Everyone set?
- Yeah.

55:05.097 --> 55:07.182
Ready, and, uh, action.

55:08.059 --> 55:10.394
I used to know a girl,
she had a dozen guys.

55:11.061 --> 55:13.396
One of them found out about it,
beat her up so bad,

55:13.398 --> 55:15.648
she ended up in a hospital
on Guerrero Street.

55:16.900 --> 55:19.027
- What a story, Mark.
- Cut!

55:19.487 --> 55:22.907
Oh, God. Okay. Uh...

55:26.244 --> 55:27.454
Hey, uh...

55:28.371 --> 55:31.081
So, the story he's telling you,

55:31.874 --> 55:34.834
- the one you yourself wrote.
- Yeah?

55:34.836 --> 55:36.546
It's not a funny story, Tommy.

55:36.880 --> 55:39.671
Yeah. I thought, I thought this
was a serious scene, Tommy.

55:39.673 --> 55:41.217
- Yeah. Why are you laughing?
- Okay.

55:41.508 --> 55:44.595
Well, sometimes people
do crazy things. Right?

55:45.179 --> 55:46.179
Human behavior.

55:47.766 --> 55:50.182
Okay, fair enough.
Maybe just get one

55:50.184 --> 55:52.226
where you don't laugh at the story.
Okay?

55:52.228 --> 55:54.063
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

55:54.271 --> 55:55.979
- Okay?
- Yeah.

55:55.981 --> 55:57.148
Okay, we still rolling?

55:57.150 --> 55:58.106
We're still rolling.

55:58.108 --> 55:59.525
- Okay, we're set.
- Okay, we'll pick it up.

55:59.527 --> 56:01.443
- Go.
- All right. Set speed.

56:01.445 --> 56:03.280
Ready, and action.

56:03.947 --> 56:06.450
I used to know a girl,
she had a dozen guys.

56:07.075 --> 56:09.452
One of them found out about it,
beat her up so bad,

56:09.454 --> 56:11.579
she ended up at a hospital
on Guerrero Street.

56:11.581 --> 56:14.793
What a story, Mark.

56:15.876 --> 56:17.709
- Cut!
- He's not gonna listen to you.

56:17.711 --> 56:19.253
We're gonna be here all night.
Just call it.

56:19.255 --> 56:21.963
All right. Cut, check it.
Great. I think we got it.

56:21.965 --> 56:23.759
Okay, great. Check gate.

56:27.472 --> 56:28.598
It's human behavior.

56:30.307 --> 56:32.892
He knows nothing
about filmmaking.

56:32.894 --> 56:35.269
He's a complete idiot. I don't
even think he's seen a movie.

56:35.271 --> 56:37.063
He's clearly never
been on a set before.

56:37.065 --> 56:38.314
What? Have you ever heard
about someone

56:38.316 --> 56:39.439
producing, directing...

56:39.441 --> 56:41.191
This guy doesn't know anything.

56:41.193 --> 56:42.318
Talking all the time.

56:42.320 --> 56:43.820
Who gives this guy money?

56:43.822 --> 56:45.488
Oh, I don't even want
to get into that.

56:45.490 --> 56:47.210
That's something
I don't even want to probe.

56:50.994 --> 56:51.996
Oh, wow.

56:52.329 --> 56:53.498
I love burrito.

56:56.583 --> 56:58.168
Uh, Tommy. So, um...

56:59.170 --> 57:00.794
The reason we brought you here

57:00.796 --> 57:03.338
is because we've,
we've been talking,

57:03.340 --> 57:07.177
and... we decided that we want
to move in together.

57:08.262 --> 57:09.262
Oh...

57:11.099 --> 57:12.350
I sorry.

57:12.809 --> 57:13.977
Impossible.

57:14.351 --> 57:16.436
I have no room
for three people in my place.

57:16.438 --> 57:20.064
Oh, no. That's, that's not
what I mean. Um...

57:20.066 --> 57:21.523
No, Greg's gonna
move in with me.

57:21.525 --> 57:23.191
Yeah...

57:23.193 --> 57:24.193
What?

57:25.320 --> 57:27.113
Well, you, you know.
We've been going out

57:27.115 --> 57:28.990
for a little while now,
and it just...

57:28.992 --> 57:30.575
Kinda felt like the
right next step.

57:30.577 --> 57:31.450
The right time.

57:31.452 --> 57:32.452
Exactly.

57:38.626 --> 57:39.626
What about movie?

57:39.878 --> 57:40.878
What about it?

57:41.713 --> 57:43.378
What... Living together
and the movie

57:43.380 --> 57:45.840
have nothing to do
with each other.

57:45.842 --> 57:46.842
Oh.

57:47.135 --> 57:48.845
Tommy, I'll, I'll see you
on Monday.

57:49.804 --> 57:50.804
I'll be there.

57:54.809 --> 57:56.019
I have to go to bathroom.

57:56.894 --> 57:58.228
Wait. Tommy, Tommy.

57:58.521 --> 58:00.146
Dude, just cause I'm moving out

58:00.148 --> 58:02.188
doesn't mean we're not gonna see
each other anymore.

58:04.068 --> 58:05.068
It's all right.

58:05.360 --> 58:06.568
It could've been worse,
I guess.

58:06.570 --> 58:07.570
Yeah.

58:14.412 --> 58:16.956
Everybody betray me!

58:18.208 --> 58:19.416
Oh, my foot.

58:21.418 --> 58:22.628
I hurt my foot.

58:23.880 --> 58:25.715
Just another day at the office.

58:26.048 --> 58:29.217
- Can you not right now?
- I need more lights over here.

58:29.219 --> 58:32.762
- You, help him, you, too.
- Greg.

58:32.764 --> 58:34.099
I need this look like Titanic.

58:34.349 --> 58:35.892
- The Titanic?
- Yeah, that one.

58:36.266 --> 58:38.143
- Yeah, yeah, trust me. It does.
- Okay.

58:38.394 --> 58:39.769
- Okay, okay. We go.
- Tommy, Tommy,

58:39.771 --> 58:41.269
this is not necessary.

58:41.271 --> 58:42.939
Ver... Very necessary. Very...

58:42.941 --> 58:45.108
I need to show my ass
to sell this movie.

58:45.110 --> 58:47.487
- That's not true...
- At least we have a closed set.

58:47.695 --> 58:51.572
Not closed set. Open set.
Life is not closed set.

58:51.574 --> 58:54.452
I want everyone to see.
You especially.

58:54.702 --> 58:55.992
Wh... Why? What?

58:55.994 --> 58:58.329
Brad Pitt do this
in The Legend of the Fall.

58:58.331 --> 58:59.331
Julie, are you okay?

59:00.333 --> 59:01.958
Could we maybe just put on
some music to get in the mood?

59:01.960 --> 59:03.459
Like maybe a little
Alicia Keys...

59:03.461 --> 59:04.961
I'm sorry, we're not
here to promote

59:04.963 --> 59:06.711
other people's work. All right?

59:06.713 --> 59:08.923
We go. Okay? Rolling?

59:08.925 --> 59:10.969
Wait. Wait. Wait. Cut, cut.
What is this?

59:11.260 --> 59:13.802
- What is this? This disgusting?
- It's my body.

59:13.804 --> 59:15.931
No, this, pimples on the...
Makeup!

59:16.141 --> 59:18.057
Makeup, come fix this
disgusting body.

59:18.059 --> 59:19.767
Tommy! Stop it. What the fuck?

59:19.769 --> 59:21.979
Juliette, I'm so sorry. I'm so...

59:22.479 --> 59:24.521
Dude, what... What are you doing?
Why are you acting like this?

59:24.523 --> 59:27.691
This American movie.
She need to look sexy. Beautiful

59:27.693 --> 59:29.653
- Come here. Come on.
- What?

59:30.572 --> 59:32.780
- Fuck, man.
- I know I'm hard on her.

59:32.782 --> 59:34.322
Yeah you're hard...
It's not just that.

59:34.324 --> 59:35.782
What's going on with you?

59:35.784 --> 59:37.828
Stanley Kubrick.
He nice to actor?

59:38.329 --> 59:40.707
Alfred Hitchcock?
Let me tell you something, Greg.

59:41.081 --> 59:42.497
He do this movie, Birds.

59:42.499 --> 59:43.666
Yeah, I'm aware of The Birds.

59:43.668 --> 59:46.084
On this movie,
he terrified the actors.

59:46.086 --> 59:47.378
- He locked them in rooms.
- Tommy...

59:47.380 --> 59:49.965
He throw birds at them.
Real birds!

59:51.092 --> 59:52.175
Nasty stuff.

59:52.177 --> 59:53.845
The actors, they cry every day.

59:54.137 --> 59:57.805
This movie win every award.
Is Mr. Hitchcock bad man?

59:57.807 --> 59:59.347
No. He great director!

59:59.349 --> 01:00:00.682
Yeah, but he was an asshole

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:02.851
and I bet he didn't direct
with his fucking dick out.

01:00:02.853 --> 01:00:05.813
Oh, really? Well, maybe we check
the record, okay?

01:00:05.815 --> 01:00:07.523
You know, for your information,

01:00:07.525 --> 01:00:10.693
the word director come from dictator.
Rest my case.

01:00:10.695 --> 01:00:12.861
You can't treat them like this.
It's not right.

01:00:12.863 --> 01:00:14.113
I treat them how I treat them.

01:00:14.115 --> 01:00:15.822
If anyone needs to
be upset here,

01:00:15.824 --> 01:00:17.115
- it's me, quite frankly.
- What?

01:00:17.117 --> 01:00:19.410
I give them job.
I give them salary.

01:00:19.412 --> 01:00:21.954
I already spend five million
dollar on this movie, Greg.

01:00:21.956 --> 01:00:24.039
Five... Are you kidding me?
Five million dollars?

01:00:24.041 --> 01:00:25.333
And they are not grateful.

01:00:25.335 --> 01:00:26.876
Nobody respect my vision.

01:00:26.878 --> 01:00:29.378
I know what they say, Greg,
I hear them.

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.588
Nobody trust me.
Not even you, Greg!

01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:34.675
- That's... What are you...
- See, you don't even trust me.

01:00:34.677 --> 01:00:36.218
- Hey, Tommy, Tommy, hey!
- Let's go! Let's go.

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.095
- Be nice to her! Be nice to her!
- Juliette, let's go.

01:00:38.097 --> 01:00:40.472
- Let's go.
- Juliette. Hey, hey...

01:00:40.474 --> 01:00:43.267
If you're not comfortable,
tell me, okay?

01:00:43.269 --> 01:00:45.939
- I can do it. It's fine.
- All right, roll it.

01:00:46.313 --> 01:00:49.066
Ready, and action.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.907
I think you're
aiming a little bit high.

01:00:57.909 --> 01:01:00.535
I aim where I aim.
Just do the scene.

01:01:00.537 --> 01:01:02.662
Why is he having sex
with her bellybutton?

01:01:02.664 --> 01:01:03.787
Oh, my God.

01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:05.497
He knows where
her vagina is, right?

01:01:05.499 --> 01:01:09.334
Okay. Cut. I need more passion.
And this, this still disgusting.

01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:11.713
- You don't clean it.
- Fuck that, okay.

01:01:11.923 --> 01:01:14.005
You embarrass that girl in front
of the entire crew,

01:01:14.007 --> 01:01:15.508
you're a dead man.

01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:18.218
Oh, really? I'm dead man, I'm dead man?

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.262
Everyone, everyone calm down.
Jesus. Come on.

01:01:20.264 --> 01:01:21.680
Juliette, you need a break.
Take a break.

01:01:21.682 --> 01:01:22.432
I'm okay.

01:01:22.434 --> 01:01:23.224
She okay.

01:01:23.226 --> 01:01:23.932
All right, well,
I need a break.

01:01:23.934 --> 01:01:25.014
- Then you're fired!
- What?

01:01:25.561 --> 01:01:26.184
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:01:26.186 --> 01:01:27.102
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:01:27.104 --> 01:01:29.146
I know what you say.
I hear you. And you.

01:01:29.148 --> 01:01:31.481
And you, and you.
I hear everybody.

01:01:31.483 --> 01:01:32.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:01:32.402 --> 01:01:33.526
Wh... What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:01:33.528 --> 01:01:34.904
Where Marcus? Marcus!

01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:36.486
Marc... Film, now.

01:01:36.488 --> 01:01:39.240
This Marcus.
I hire him to documentary

01:01:39.242 --> 01:01:40.282
the making of The Room.

01:01:40.284 --> 01:01:44.119
He capture every comment.
"Oh, yeah, Tommy weird."

01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:46.581
"Tommy like Frankenstein."
"He like...

01:01:46.583 --> 01:01:48.624
He like vampire rapist."

01:01:48.626 --> 01:01:50.459
I hear everything!

01:01:50.461 --> 01:01:51.586
I have ears everywhere!

01:01:51.588 --> 01:01:53.796
I hear your whispers
in your souls!

01:01:53.798 --> 01:01:56.256
- You're on my planet! Okay?
- Wait, wait.

01:01:56.258 --> 01:01:58.633
So you've been spying
on your entire production?

01:01:58.635 --> 01:02:01.304
- Yeah, that's right.
- That's fucking crazy.

01:02:01.306 --> 01:02:04.432
That how it is. So now you know.
Next time you make laughter,

01:02:04.434 --> 01:02:05.974
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...

01:02:05.976 --> 01:02:08.811
I don't care who you are,
you're out on street.

01:02:08.813 --> 01:02:10.148
What about me? Am I still fired?

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.443
All right, I give you
one more chance.

01:02:20.617 --> 01:02:21.617
Take three's up.

01:02:22.619 --> 01:02:25.497
Let's go.
Make sure you see my ass.

01:02:27.499 --> 01:02:28.792
- See you at the car?
- Okay.

01:02:36.965 --> 01:02:37.965
Tommy.

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:41.304
Tommy, we're leaving.

01:02:52.106 --> 01:02:54.189
I feel like, um...

01:02:54.191 --> 01:02:56.193
I feel like we should
at least talk about this.

01:02:57.528 --> 01:02:58.530
Look at my arm.

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:00.697
Not bad.

01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:03.032
Look like big strong kid.

01:03:03.034 --> 01:03:06.037
Yeah, man.

01:03:08.956 --> 01:03:10.708
All right. I'll, uh...
I'll see you.

01:03:18.465 --> 01:03:21.719
I haven't seen any water.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

01:03:22.302 --> 01:03:24.887
- Yeah, fuck this place.
- There's no AC in here.

01:03:24.889 --> 01:03:26.266
He's too fucking cheap.

01:03:27.891 --> 01:03:30.184
Nobody wants to help me.

01:03:30.186 --> 01:03:31.852
And I'm dying.

01:03:31.854 --> 01:03:33.896
Hey. It's like 100 fucking
degrees in here.

01:03:33.898 --> 01:03:35.021
He show up yet?

01:03:35.023 --> 01:03:38.066
No. I wish. Hey, guys,
if he doesn't get here soon,

01:03:38.068 --> 01:03:38.985
I just say we call lunch.

01:03:38.987 --> 01:03:39.901
What do you say?

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:41.223
- Lunch!
- Yeah.

01:03:41.738 --> 01:03:44.197
- You wanna just keep rehearsing?
- Sure, sure.

01:03:44.199 --> 01:03:46.825
- Um...
- Um, you're not dying, Mom.

01:03:46.827 --> 01:03:49.412
I got the results
of the test back.

01:03:49.414 --> 01:03:51.997
I definitely have breast cancer.

01:03:51.999 --> 01:03:53.999
- Hi, everybody.
- Oh!

01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:56.795
- Hey, you're here.
- Hey, everybody. Here camera.

01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:58.588
Okay, you ready?

01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:00.088
Where have you been, man?

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:01.006
Where have I been? You know,

01:04:01.008 --> 01:04:02.717
just getting ready
in my apartment.

01:04:02.719 --> 01:04:04.052
I live there alone now.

01:04:04.345 --> 01:04:06.220
- Tommy.
- Yeah, question?

01:04:06.222 --> 01:04:08.097
Does this come back?

01:04:08.099 --> 01:04:09.765
What are...
What she talking about?

01:04:09.767 --> 01:04:11.057
This story line.

01:04:11.059 --> 01:04:15.230
- The breast cancer.
- Breast cancer? No. It's twist.

01:04:16.356 --> 01:04:17.939
So it never comes back?

01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:20.651
I don't have time
to explain script to you, okay?

01:04:20.653 --> 01:04:23.863
What is this makeup? You look
like you're swimming in lake.

01:04:23.865 --> 01:04:26.072
- It's 100 degrees in...
- Makeup!

01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:28.159
Tommy! If you're not going
to pay for air conditioning

01:04:28.161 --> 01:04:29.744
you at least have to
pay for water.

01:04:29.746 --> 01:04:31.077
Yeah, could we just
have a little

01:04:31.079 --> 01:04:32.622
bit of water before the scene?
I...

01:04:32.624 --> 01:04:35.749
Okay I stop you. I stop
everybody right there, okay?

01:04:35.751 --> 01:04:38.293
Nobody in Hollywood will give
you water either, okay?

01:04:38.295 --> 01:04:40.463
That's not true.
Dude, we can't work like this.

01:04:40.465 --> 01:04:42.090
I'm not Santa Claus, all right?

01:04:42.092 --> 01:04:44.883
Maybe you go buy water
for everybody, Greg.

01:04:44.885 --> 01:04:48.431
Okay? Maybe girlfriend bring
you water or something.

01:04:48.639 --> 01:04:50.764
We gotta get going, okay?
We're already four hours behind.

01:04:50.766 --> 01:04:53.435
- Okay, well, whose fault that?
- Yours.

01:04:54.813 --> 01:04:57.396
- My fault?
- You're late every goddamn day.

01:04:57.398 --> 01:04:58.731
All right, that your five cents.

01:04:58.733 --> 01:05:00.525
- I'm fucking director.
- Exactly.

01:05:00.527 --> 01:05:02.026
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

01:05:02.028 --> 01:05:03.653
Exactly. Turn these lights
on right now!

01:05:03.655 --> 01:05:05.070
If I turn on the lights,
it's gonna get hotter.

01:05:05.072 --> 01:05:07.280
- Be professional, do your job.
- You do your job!

01:05:07.282 --> 01:05:08.615
Tommy, it's hot enough as is.

01:05:08.617 --> 01:05:10.242
Greg, so you know
about light too?

01:05:10.244 --> 01:05:11.577
Huh? You know everything.

01:05:11.579 --> 01:05:13.829
Huh? You know water,
light, girlfriend.

01:05:13.831 --> 01:05:15.497
Oh, my God!
Carolyn just fainted!

01:05:15.499 --> 01:05:16.499
- Hey, hey.
- Tommy, please get

01:05:16.501 --> 01:05:17.458
her some water.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.126
Tommy, get some fucking water.
Come on.

01:05:19.128 --> 01:05:21.963
- Carolyn? Carolyn.
- What she doing, taking nap?

01:05:21.965 --> 01:05:23.673
She's not taking a fucking nap,

01:05:23.675 --> 01:05:26.675
you fucking idiot.
She passed out.

01:05:26.677 --> 01:05:29.470
She's not dead.
No. I can feel her heartbeat.

01:05:29.472 --> 01:05:31.389
It's not 'cause water.
It's 'cause she old lady.

01:05:31.391 --> 01:05:32.809
Tommy, please!

01:05:33.767 --> 01:05:35.559
You know what, that's it.
I'm pulling the plug.

01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:36.811
Turn off the lights.

01:05:36.813 --> 01:05:40.814
Open the doors. That's lunch.
I'm cooling it out in here.

01:05:40.816 --> 01:05:42.023
She okay?
Can we get the medic?

01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:43.360
Turn off these lights!

01:05:44.362 --> 01:05:46.945
The best thing I can say about
this is nobody will ever see it.

01:05:46.947 --> 01:05:48.197
We can walk off.
We can walk off...

01:05:48.199 --> 01:05:50.365
I'm just tired is all.

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:52.994
I haven't been sleeping
well recently.

01:05:52.996 --> 01:05:55.539
- I'll be fine.
- Hey, can I ask you something?

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:57.416
Why, why do you do it?

01:05:57.708 --> 01:06:00.334
You have a husband
and grandkids.

01:06:00.336 --> 01:06:03.253
You live 50 miles from here,

01:06:03.255 --> 01:06:06.381
and you wake up at 5:00 am
to drive all this way.

01:06:06.383 --> 01:06:07.383
For what?

01:06:08.344 --> 01:06:12.056
We're actors, Greg.
You and me. People like us.

01:06:12.514 --> 01:06:15.932
Even the worst day
on a movie set

01:06:15.934 --> 01:06:18.729
is better than the best day
anywhere else.

01:06:20.148 --> 01:06:21.191
Hey, Greg.

01:06:22.358 --> 01:06:23.648
Can we ask you something?

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:25.778
- Yeah?
- What is this movie about?

01:06:27.405 --> 01:06:29.780
- I have a theory.
- Oh?

01:06:29.782 --> 01:06:31.116
Autobiographical.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.785
Someone in his life was a Denny,

01:06:33.787 --> 01:06:36.119
a kid brother
he was always looking out for.

01:06:36.121 --> 01:06:37.412
Someone was a Mark.

01:06:37.414 --> 01:06:39.999
A better looking friend
he was always jealous of.

01:06:40.001 --> 01:06:42.420
I'm sure there was
a Michelle and a Mike.

01:06:42.836 --> 01:06:45.422
So, does that mean
there's a Lisa?

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.590
Somebody who broke his heart?

01:06:47.592 --> 01:06:49.758
Stabbed him in the back
and ruined his life?

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.304
Well, that's pretty
obvious to me.

01:06:52.764 --> 01:06:54.140
That's the universe.

01:07:02.315 --> 01:07:04.941
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's Bryan fucking Cranston.

01:07:04.943 --> 01:07:06.358
Oh, hey, I know him.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.443
Oh, yeah, no shit.
Malcolm in the Middle.

01:07:08.445 --> 01:07:10.403
No. From Pilates.

01:07:10.405 --> 01:07:11.645
- Brian!
- What are you... Wait!

01:07:12.117 --> 01:07:14.534
- Hi!
- Amber! How are you?

01:07:14.536 --> 01:07:16.077
- So good to see you.
- You too.

01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:17.327
This is my boyfriend, Greg.

01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:18.871
- Hey, Greg, how are you?
- Good, yeah.

01:07:18.873 --> 01:07:20.414
Greg is also an actor.

01:07:20.416 --> 01:07:21.456
- You are?
- Yeah.

01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:24.001
Cool. Anything I would
have seen you in?

01:07:24.003 --> 01:07:26.503
- Ah, no. I doubt it.
- Well, you know, it's a journey.

01:07:27.632 --> 01:07:29.005
Are you working on
anything at the moment?

01:07:29.007 --> 01:07:31.467
Yes, yeah, actually
I'm, I'm doing this movie.

01:07:31.469 --> 01:07:32.885
- Movie? Nice!
- Yeah.

01:07:32.887 --> 01:07:35.930
Yeah, but, you know,
I'd love to do TV at some point.

01:07:35.932 --> 01:07:39.517
Yeah, you know.
Sitcoms, drama, cop shows,

01:07:39.519 --> 01:07:41.394
Yeah, you name it,
I would doit.

01:07:41.396 --> 01:07:42.979
It's funny you mention that.

01:07:42.981 --> 01:07:46.731
'Cause, um... I'm directing an
episode of Malcolm right now.

01:07:46.733 --> 01:07:49.153
Next week we're shooting a scene
where the boys get lost,

01:07:49.487 --> 01:07:52.363
and Hal and Lois have to
go find them in the woods,

01:07:52.365 --> 01:07:56.117
and we're having trouble
finding this lumberjack role.

01:07:56.119 --> 01:07:59.327
And you got this this beard.
What do you think?

01:07:59.329 --> 01:08:00.787
You wanna, you wanna do it?

01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:02.497
Are you serious?

01:08:02.499 --> 01:08:04.459
Yeah, well, you know,
everybody needs a break.

01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:05.503
A... Are you good?

01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:07.253
- I should've asked that first.
- Yes, yes, no.

01:08:07.255 --> 01:08:08.298
He's very good.

01:08:09.382 --> 01:08:10.380
Listen man, I'm sorry,
I'm freaking out a little bit.

01:08:10.382 --> 01:08:11.465
I'm a big fan.

01:08:11.467 --> 01:08:13.300
- This is like, it's crazy.
- All right.

01:08:13.302 --> 01:08:16.344
All right. You and the beard
next Tuesday and Wednesday.

01:08:16.345 --> 01:08:17.304
I will be there.

01:08:17.305 --> 01:08:18.889
Great to see you!

01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:20.599
- Thank you, man, seriously.
- You're welcome.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.321
- See you next week.
- Thanks, thanks again.

01:08:25.856 --> 01:08:26.899
Okay, I'm set.

01:08:27.609 --> 01:08:28.609
Action.

01:08:31.194 --> 01:08:33.654
Screw the whole world!

01:08:48.505 --> 01:08:50.381
Why?

01:08:51.048 --> 01:08:55.093
Why? Why is this
happening to me?

01:08:55.095 --> 01:08:56.095
Why?

01:08:58.471 --> 01:09:01.100
God, forgive me.

01:09:10.484 --> 01:09:11.692
Why is he
getting back up?

01:09:14.404 --> 01:09:16.573
- Cut.
- No. Don't cut. Don't cut.

01:09:17.158 --> 01:09:19.951
Why you cut, Sandy?
This is great. This real acting.

01:09:19.953 --> 01:09:21.368
If you're gonna writhe around
with the dress,

01:09:21.371 --> 01:09:22.536
maybe do it before
you shoot yourself

01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:23.745
in the head
and blow your brains out.

01:09:23.747 --> 01:09:24.830
I disagree.

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:27.960
We go. Okay. Still rolling.
Here we go.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:29.420
And action.

01:09:39.095 --> 01:09:41.013
I wanted to keep that dress.

01:09:41.015 --> 01:09:42.764
You can never wear
that dress again.

01:09:49.064 --> 01:09:50.356
Okay. Now I do kill part.

01:09:50.358 --> 01:09:52.567
Oh, great, yeah.
Let's cover that again.

01:09:52.569 --> 01:09:53.653
Give me countdown.

01:09:54.445 --> 01:09:55.445
Three, two, one, bang.

01:09:58.740 --> 01:09:59.740
Wow.

01:10:00.534 --> 01:10:02.244
- Cut.
- And cut.

01:10:02.619 --> 01:10:04.495
- I think we got it.
- I guess so, yeah.

01:10:04.497 --> 01:10:06.082
Get me a C-stand
over there, please.

01:10:06.707 --> 01:10:08.585
Dude, that was, amazing.

01:10:10.252 --> 01:10:11.960
- You think so?
- Totally. Yeah.

01:10:11.962 --> 01:10:14.171
It was... It was raw...
and intense.

01:10:14.173 --> 01:10:16.093
And, yeah, you really
brought it, man. Seriously.

01:10:16.467 --> 01:10:17.717
- Thank you.
- So, uh...

01:10:17.719 --> 01:10:20.928
So listen. I know, I know this
is last minute, but, um..

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:22.388
I just wanted to talk to you
about something real quick.

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:24.598
What is it, Greg? You can see
I'm very busy right now.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.349
Yeah. Yeah, um...
So, so you know how

01:10:26.351 --> 01:10:27.643
the big beard shaving
scene is tomorrow?

01:10:27.645 --> 01:10:29.394
- Yeah, I know the schedule.
- Right.

01:10:29.396 --> 01:10:30.937
So I was just... I was hoping
that we can maybe

01:10:30.939 --> 01:10:32.063
move it to next week.

01:10:32.065 --> 01:10:33.865
And that I can maybe
get the day off tomorrow.

01:10:34.569 --> 01:10:35.902
Why? You sick?

01:10:35.904 --> 01:10:36.904
Oh, no.

01:10:37.739 --> 01:10:39.321
Greg, I can't afford you
get sick right now.

01:10:39.323 --> 01:10:40.156
You're lead actor,
I'm director.

01:10:40.158 --> 01:10:41.156
I feel great, man.
It's not that.

01:10:41.158 --> 01:10:42.909
- I feel great.
- Why, why? Why you need day off?

01:10:42.911 --> 01:10:45.954
I, I actually... I landed a small
role in a TV show.

01:10:46.288 --> 01:10:47.664
It's, uh, Malcolm in the Middle.

01:10:47.916 --> 01:10:49.665
You're movie actor now.

01:10:49.667 --> 01:10:51.625
Why you do this, this TV?

01:10:51.627 --> 01:10:53.503
Well, it's... It's kind of
a big show. It's...

01:10:53.505 --> 01:10:54.961
You know, it would be
great exposure.

01:10:54.963 --> 01:10:55.838
It would be like a really good

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:58.508
stepping stone
for my career, I think.

01:10:58.510 --> 01:11:00.050
What you do
in this Little Malcolm?

01:11:00.052 --> 01:11:01.844
I'm, I'm playing, like,
a lumberjack.

01:11:01.846 --> 01:11:04.263
And, um...
That's why the beard...

01:11:04.265 --> 01:11:05.223
That's why I need it.

01:11:05.225 --> 01:11:07.811
Uh, which is why
I can't shave tomorrow.

01:11:08.478 --> 01:11:09.936
But if we, if we just
move the schedule

01:11:09.938 --> 01:11:11.978
just like a day or two,
it would...

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:12.897
It would really mean
a lot to me.

01:11:12.899 --> 01:11:15.191
Oh, I'm sorry, Greg.
I can't help you.

01:11:15.193 --> 01:11:17.902
- What... Why? What?
- Clean-shaven Mark.

01:11:17.904 --> 01:11:21.155
You know, he make grand entrance
at beginning of third act.

01:11:21.157 --> 01:11:23.156
Very important. It's metaphor.

01:11:23.158 --> 01:11:25.701
I know. I know. But we can just,
we can do it next week.

01:11:25.703 --> 01:11:27.286
- It's not a big deal...
- No, I can't, Greg!

01:11:27.288 --> 01:11:29.037
- Impossible. I'm sorry.
- Tommy.

01:11:29.039 --> 01:11:30.497
I can't give you special
treatment, Greg.

01:11:30.499 --> 01:11:33.250
What? I can't give special
treatment to everybody.

01:11:33.252 --> 01:11:34.378
Everybody here working hard.

01:11:35.547 --> 01:11:36.920
One favor. I'm just asking
for a tiny favor, as a friend.

01:11:36.922 --> 01:11:37.921
- Favor, favor.
- Yes.

01:11:37.923 --> 01:11:38.964
Favor.
You always ask for favor.

01:11:38.966 --> 01:11:40.340
This is one tiny thing,
that's it.

01:11:40.342 --> 01:11:42.718
I take you to Los Angeles,
give you place to stay.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.512
I write you this part.

01:11:44.514 --> 01:11:46.222
I do this whole movie
for you, Greg.

01:11:46.224 --> 01:11:48.348
What? You did it for me?
Come on, man.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:50.058
For us. We do it together.

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:52.812
Okay. Yes. It's our movie.
It doesn't change that.

01:11:52.814 --> 01:11:55.231
- Don't betray me, Greg.
- I'm not betraying you.

01:11:55.233 --> 01:11:56.898
What I say, we do this together.

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:59.235
We do this together
and now you betray me.

01:11:59.237 --> 01:12:00.237
I'm not...

01:12:01.489 --> 01:12:03.074
So are you gonna
let me do it or not?

01:12:03.908 --> 01:12:06.244
Not up to me, Greg.
It up to you.

01:12:06.703 --> 01:12:07.703
You have to choose.

01:12:08.078 --> 01:12:10.745
You do this TV show
Little Malcolm

01:12:10.747 --> 01:12:12.665
or you do the movie.

01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:13.793
Our movie, Greg.

01:12:19.591 --> 01:12:20.591
Greg.

01:12:24.261 --> 01:12:25.804
- I...
- Unbelievable.

01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:32.771
She had to go?

01:12:46.242 --> 01:12:50.452
- Whoa!
- Wow.

01:12:50.454 --> 01:12:52.457
Hey, guys. You like it?

01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:55.208
- Yeah.
- You look great.

01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:57.125
Look like... Baby Face.

01:12:57.127 --> 01:12:58.335
You guys wanna
play some football?

01:12:58.337 --> 01:13:00.713
In tuxes?
No, you gotta be kidding.

01:13:00.715 --> 01:13:03.133
- Mark, come on, let's do it.
- I'm up for it.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.970
- Johnny?
- Ask Peter.

01:13:06.762 --> 01:13:08.220
Peter, come on.

01:13:08.222 --> 01:13:10.265
- No. I don't think so.
- Please.

01:13:10.975 --> 01:13:12.517
- No.
- Come on!

01:13:19.024 --> 01:13:20.691
Cut.

01:13:20.693 --> 01:13:22.278
You good, Tommy?

01:13:23.904 --> 01:13:27.240
Yeah. Good day, everybody.
See you tomorrow.

01:13:27.242 --> 01:13:28.741
All right. Great job.

01:13:28.743 --> 01:13:30.451
I don't believe it.

01:13:30.453 --> 01:13:33.998
Let's go to a bar
and erase the memory of today.

01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:38.002
- Hey, Sandy, Raphael.
- Yep?

01:13:38.461 --> 01:13:39.546
Can I talk to you minute?

01:13:46.677 --> 01:13:47.679
Road trip.

01:13:48.512 --> 01:13:50.140
San Francisco, here we come.

01:13:50.597 --> 01:13:51.722
Hey, who are these guys?

01:13:51.724 --> 01:13:54.267
Oh, that's Todd,
that's friend of Todd.

01:13:54.269 --> 01:13:56.102
And... other friend of Todd

01:13:56.104 --> 01:13:57.188
Where's Sandy and Raphael?

01:13:57.689 --> 01:13:59.566
Uh... It's over for those guys.

01:14:00.315 --> 01:14:01.398
Did you fire them?

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.608
Who's to say?
Come on, forget about them.

01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:05.154
- Why?
- We have Todd now.

01:14:05.529 --> 01:14:07.612
Look, it's gonna be
like the old days.

01:14:07.614 --> 01:14:10.534
San Francisco.
We take stroll down memory lane.

01:14:11.327 --> 01:14:14.245
Wait till you see new script pages, Greg.
You love it.

01:14:14.247 --> 01:14:15.748
Be very dramatic.

01:14:16.373 --> 01:14:18.710
Let's do it. Okay, Todd.

01:14:19.711 --> 01:14:21.210
Yeah, you put camera there,
okay?

01:14:21.212 --> 01:14:22.044
Yep. It's here.

01:14:22.046 --> 01:14:23.295
Okay, we throw
a ball over here.

01:14:23.297 --> 01:14:25.048
Come on, Greg. Come on, Greg.

01:14:26.508 --> 01:14:28.509
Remember, Greg?
We played football.

01:14:28.511 --> 01:14:30.346
- First time we met.
- Yeah, yeah, I remember.

01:14:30.555 --> 01:14:33.680
Okay. Okay.
Todd, can you roll it?

01:14:33.682 --> 01:14:34.682
Rolling.

01:14:39.564 --> 01:14:42.063
- Tommy, what are we doing here?
- We do new scene.

01:14:42.065 --> 01:14:43.398
About Mark failure.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.275
What?

01:14:44.277 --> 01:14:45.817
Mark want to make
dreams come true.

01:14:45.819 --> 01:14:47.070
And Johnny help him.

01:14:47.739 --> 01:14:50.156
- Yeah, I don't think so, man.
- Let's do it.

01:14:50.158 --> 01:14:52.075
Come on.
Take from your real life.

01:14:52.577 --> 01:14:54.244
Drop it. Stop. Don't do this.

01:14:55.078 --> 01:14:56.912
I'm asking you nicely.
Stop it. Drop it.

01:14:56.914 --> 01:14:58.915
Remember? You want
to be actor, but...

01:14:58.917 --> 01:15:01.086
nobody believe in you, Greg.

01:15:01.418 --> 01:15:02.835
You know.
You're not good enough.

01:15:02.837 --> 01:15:04.586
Like, do that. That stuff.

01:15:04.588 --> 01:15:06.091
What? No. Tommy, drop it.

01:15:06.591 --> 01:15:07.883
Movies are emotion.

01:15:08.258 --> 01:15:10.095
Okay, you need
to be real for us.

01:15:10.552 --> 01:15:13.097
- God.
- Look... Greg.

01:15:13.597 --> 01:15:17.015
Frankly, you have not been
that real the whole movie.

01:15:17.017 --> 01:15:18.851
- Now your chance.
- Fuck you, Tommy.

01:15:18.853 --> 01:15:21.394
No one believe in you,
and mom think you're loser.

01:15:21.396 --> 01:15:22.437
- Go.
- I said no!

01:15:22.439 --> 01:15:24.942
Greg, damn it!
Why you throw this tricky stuff?

01:15:27.444 --> 01:15:28.804
All right, man.
You wanna get real?

01:15:29.114 --> 01:15:30.821
You wanna get real
for the cameras, let's get real.

01:15:30.823 --> 01:15:32.115
Hey, you guys getting this?

01:15:32.117 --> 01:15:33.116
Yeah? Good.

01:15:33.118 --> 01:15:35.201
Let's get real.
Where were you born, Tommy?

01:15:35.203 --> 01:15:37.536
No... Greg, that not
part of scene.

01:15:37.538 --> 01:15:39.037
No way. This is your idea.

01:15:39.039 --> 01:15:40.917
Where you from?
It's a simple question.

01:15:42.961 --> 01:15:45.253
- I'm from New Orleans.
- New Orleans.

01:15:45.255 --> 01:15:46.297
From the bayou.

01:15:47.131 --> 01:15:48.255
You guys hear that?

01:15:48.257 --> 01:15:51.425
This guy with this fucking
accent is from the bayou.

01:15:51.427 --> 01:15:52.259
Greg.

01:15:52.261 --> 01:15:53.719
Hey, you want
an easier question...

01:15:53.721 --> 01:15:55.804
Let's see, where does
the money come from? Huh?

01:15:55.806 --> 01:15:58.014
Greg, stop. This on camera.

01:15:58.016 --> 01:16:00.643
I know it's on camera.
Just like you want it.

01:16:00.645 --> 01:16:02.313
All right. Just tell me
this one thing.

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.523
How old are you?

01:16:08.944 --> 01:16:10.697
- I'm your age, Greg.
- You're my age?

01:16:11.239 --> 01:16:12.571
You're my age?

01:16:12.573 --> 01:16:14.823
- I'm just your friend.
- When were you born?

01:16:14.825 --> 01:16:16.366
- What year, Tommy?
- Same year as you.

01:16:16.368 --> 01:16:18.827
Same year as me?
There is no fucking way

01:16:18.829 --> 01:16:20.162
you're in your 20s, all right?

01:16:20.164 --> 01:16:21.830
You are a fucking villain.

01:16:21.832 --> 01:16:23.290
Fucking Frankenstein
looking motherfucker.

01:16:23.292 --> 01:16:24.292
I'm not villain!

01:16:28.672 --> 01:16:31.383
I believed in you, man.
I trusted you! For what?

01:16:31.967 --> 01:16:32.967
Greg.

01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:35.178
I gave you everything.

01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.847
Are you fucking...
You ruined everything!

01:16:37.849 --> 01:16:38.849
Greg.

01:16:40.517 --> 01:16:41.853
You owe me your life.

01:16:42.311 --> 01:16:44.021
Man, I don't
owe you shit anymore.

01:16:45.523 --> 01:16:47.566
All right, and this movie
better be fucking awesome.

01:16:48.359 --> 01:16:49.359
It will be awesome.

01:16:51.362 --> 01:16:52.489
Cut it. Cut it.

01:16:53.782 --> 01:16:54.782
Movie over.

01:17:05.042 --> 01:17:08.251
Why am I trying to become
what I don't wanna be?

01:17:08.253 --> 01:17:10.838
What am I doing
in an office making

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:14.634
a contemptuous begging
fool of myself,

01:17:14.636 --> 01:17:16.969
when all I want is out there?

01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:19.847
Honey, I am so
excited to come see your play.

01:17:19.849 --> 01:17:22.390
See? Acting doesn't have
to be big movies.

01:17:22.392 --> 01:17:23.893
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

01:17:23.895 --> 01:17:25.393
It's probably better
if no one even sees

01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:27.312
that thing you did with
Tommy, right?

01:17:27.314 --> 01:17:28.954
I mean, come on, that thing
can't be good.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.200
Greg? Greg?

01:18:13.528 --> 01:18:14.652
Hey, good show, guys.

01:18:14.654 --> 01:18:16.195
- That was fun tonight, right?
- Good job.

01:18:16.197 --> 01:18:17.317
All right, see you tomorrow.

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:31.421
Baby Face.

01:18:32.963 --> 01:18:33.963
You stalking me now?

01:18:36.258 --> 01:18:37.844
You're not that hard to find.

01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:42.765
- You watch the show?
- No.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.976
You know I don't like comedy.

01:18:45.810 --> 01:18:46.811
So how Amber?

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.480
I don't know.

01:18:49.898 --> 01:18:52.150
She moved to Austin.
Didn't work out.

01:18:52.984 --> 01:18:55.612
- I'm sorry to hear this.
- Yeah...

01:18:57.154 --> 01:18:59.594
That why you came here, Tommy?
You wanted to talk about Amber?

01:19:00.115 --> 01:19:02.534
No. You didn't RSVP.

01:19:03.619 --> 01:19:04.996
Yeah. I'm not coming.

01:19:06.997 --> 01:19:10.333
And... Honestly, maybe...

01:19:10.335 --> 01:19:13.294
Maybe you shouldn't have
a premiere at all.

01:19:13.296 --> 01:19:14.296
Greg.

01:19:15.297 --> 01:19:16.381
We made pact.

01:19:16.925 --> 01:19:18.005
Remember?

01:19:18.635 --> 01:19:20.804
To never lose sight
of our dream.

01:19:21.096 --> 01:19:24.057
On Friday, they premiere
our movie.

01:19:25.182 --> 01:19:26.642
Our movie, Greg.

01:19:27.185 --> 01:19:28.520
In real life theater.

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.300
I know you don't
like me anymore.

01:19:30.605 --> 01:19:31.815
So don't do it for me.

01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:33.982
Do it for you, Greg.

01:19:34.525 --> 01:19:37.194
You finally get to see yourself
on big screen.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.863
This was your dream too, Greg.

01:20:01.886 --> 01:20:03.680
What the fuck am I doing?

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.435
- Can you believe it?
- I can't, no.

01:20:12.730 --> 01:20:13.857
Here, this for you.

01:20:14.399 --> 01:20:15.313
No, you can, you can keep that.

01:20:15.315 --> 01:20:17.732
No, don't worry.
I made boxes of them.

01:20:17.734 --> 01:20:18.735
Okay.

01:20:28.078 --> 01:20:29.246
You think Sandy be there?

01:20:29.997 --> 01:20:30.997
I don't know.

01:20:36.587 --> 01:20:38.088
Holy shit, is this for us?

01:20:39.506 --> 01:20:40.758
Yeah, this for us.

01:20:41.091 --> 01:20:42.215
Driver, slow down.

01:20:42.217 --> 01:20:43.843
Did you get
a fucking spotlight?

01:20:43.845 --> 01:20:46.219
Yeah, this real Hollywood
premiere, Greg.

01:20:46.221 --> 01:20:49.264
Raphael, Sandy, Juliette.
Everyone's there...

01:20:49.266 --> 01:20:51.099
Go, driver, go. Keep going.

01:20:51.101 --> 01:20:52.936
- Go, go, go. Keep going.
- Tommy, what...

01:20:56.274 --> 01:20:58.648
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Tommy Wiseau.

01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:00.151
- That was fucking weird.
- Yep.

01:21:00.153 --> 01:21:02.527
At this point,
it would be fucking weird

01:21:02.529 --> 01:21:05.197
if he didn't do something
that was fucking weird.

01:21:05.199 --> 01:21:07.116
Tommy, what the fuck
are we doing?

01:21:07.118 --> 01:21:09.951
What, we gotta
build anticipation.

01:21:09.953 --> 01:21:12.956
There not enough people.

01:21:15.126 --> 01:21:16.127
Yep.

01:21:17.377 --> 01:21:19.711
Greg, we are stars of the movie.
We can't be first ones there.

01:21:19.713 --> 01:21:22.007
- You're right. You're right.
- There not enough people.

01:21:22.801 --> 01:21:23.802
Just trust me.

01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.780
- He's back?
- Over there!

01:21:36.814 --> 01:21:38.649
Tommy, come on.
We're gonna do this, yeah?

01:21:39.609 --> 01:21:40.609
It's time.

01:21:41.653 --> 01:21:42.777
He's not gonna get
out of the car.

01:21:42.779 --> 01:21:43.779
The fuck is happening?

01:21:44.655 --> 01:21:46.115
Tommy, come on, let's do this.

01:21:47.449 --> 01:21:48.449
You ready?

01:21:49.452 --> 01:21:50.452
Okay.

01:21:51.829 --> 01:21:52.956
Hey, everyone.

01:21:53.413 --> 01:21:55.330
Sorry I late. Traffic crazy.

01:21:55.332 --> 01:21:58.001
Well, let's go. Let's do it.
No one be nervous. Come on.

01:21:58.461 --> 01:22:00.505
Let's go. Let's do it.

01:22:01.506 --> 01:22:02.798
Come on, Greg.

01:22:03.507 --> 01:22:05.967
Very first premiere.
You excited?

01:22:05.969 --> 01:22:11.930
Yeah, Tommy. Sure.

01:22:11.932 --> 01:22:12.932
Hi.

01:22:15.353 --> 01:22:17.937
Wow. This is a day
I never thought would come.

01:22:17.939 --> 01:22:19.691
This is a pretty good turnout,
I gotta say.

01:22:24.445 --> 01:22:25.863
Wow. So many people.

01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:28.030
Yeah.

01:22:28.699 --> 01:22:29.700
Yeah, it's packed.

01:22:32.203 --> 01:22:33.872
Hey, you played Chris R, right?

01:22:34.122 --> 01:22:35.206
- Yeah.
- Oh.

01:22:36.373 --> 01:22:37.706
I didn't recognize you without the beanie.
And the beard.

01:22:37.708 --> 01:22:39.042
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:22:39.377 --> 01:22:41.294
I play the psychologist. Peter.

01:22:41.296 --> 01:22:42.881
- I'm in this too.
- Oh, cool, man.

01:22:43.465 --> 01:22:45.380
I feel like I'm
a little overdressed.

01:22:45.382 --> 01:22:46.465
No.

01:22:46.467 --> 01:22:47.799
Are you kidding me?
You're the star of the movie.

01:22:47.801 --> 01:22:49.041
If I could have your attention.

01:22:49.846 --> 01:22:54.055
Please welcome the writer,
director, producer, and star

01:22:54.057 --> 01:22:56.558
of tonight's extravaganza.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.644
His name is Mr. Tommy Wiseau.

01:23:14.328 --> 01:23:15.954
This my movie.

01:23:17.164 --> 01:23:18.248
And this my life.

01:23:18.917 --> 01:23:19.917
Uh...

01:23:21.211 --> 01:23:22.462
Okay. Be cool.

01:23:29.094 --> 01:23:30.095
I'm so nervous.

01:23:30.595 --> 01:23:32.055
Okay, let's begin.

01:23:45.859 --> 01:23:48.779
- Two title cards. Great.
- I have two logos.

01:23:49.447 --> 01:23:50.862
I noticed. Yeah.

01:24:04.378 --> 01:24:05.378
Hi, babe.

01:24:09.633 --> 01:24:11.261
I have something for you.

01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:14.514
- What is it?
- Just a little something.

01:24:23.064 --> 01:24:25.022
Johnny it's beautiful,
thank you.

01:24:25.024 --> 01:24:26.648
Wow.

01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:28.318
You look so sexy Lisa.

01:24:33.824 --> 01:24:34.825
Isn't it fabulous?

01:24:35.243 --> 01:24:37.036
I would do anything for my girl.

01:24:40.081 --> 01:24:41.207
Oh, hey, guys.

01:24:42.082 --> 01:24:43.082
Oh, hi, Denny.

01:24:47.463 --> 01:24:49.631
Wow. Look at you.

01:24:50.507 --> 01:24:51.675
It's from Johnny.

01:24:52.426 --> 01:24:54.343
Anything for my princess.

01:24:54.345 --> 01:24:55.680
Okay, I'm ready.

01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:57.429
This dress is so pretty.

01:24:57.431 --> 01:24:59.264
I can't wait for you
to get it off of me.

01:24:59.266 --> 01:25:01.685
Okay. Oh, wow.

01:25:13.448 --> 01:25:14.699
I just like to watch you guys.

01:25:16.033 --> 01:25:18.869
- Oh, Denny, Denny, Denny boy.
- I don't like this.

01:25:19.537 --> 01:25:21.539
Two's great,
but three's a crowd.

01:25:22.873 --> 01:25:25.210
Fine. I have homework
to do, anyway.

01:25:27.377 --> 01:25:29.380
- Bye, lovebirds.
- Bye, Denny.

01:25:30.006 --> 01:25:32.383
I'm sorry. What's his
relationship to you guys?

01:25:37.137 --> 01:25:38.931
Oh, no. No, no, no.

01:26:01.578 --> 01:26:03.537
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

01:26:03.539 --> 01:26:05.917
Yeah. Can I have a
dozen red roses, please?

01:26:06.251 --> 01:26:07.916
Oh, hi, Johnny.
I didn't know it was you.

01:26:07.918 --> 01:26:09.421
Who doesn't recognize that guy?

01:26:09.753 --> 01:26:11.797
- Here you go.
- That's me.

01:26:12.006 --> 01:26:13.714
- How much is it?
- That'll be $18.

01:26:13.716 --> 01:26:15.383
There you go. Keep the change.

01:26:15.385 --> 01:26:16.299
Hi, doggie.

01:26:16.301 --> 01:26:17.421
You're my favorite customer.

01:26:18.054 --> 01:26:19.428
Thanks a lot. Bye.

01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:21.098
Nobody wants to help me.

01:26:21.432 --> 01:26:22.475
And I'm dying.

01:26:23.725 --> 01:26:25.478
You're not dying, Mom.

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:29.148
I got the results of
the test back.

01:26:29.731 --> 01:26:32.275
I definitely have breast cancer.

01:26:32.277 --> 01:26:34.988
It never comes back.
I don't know why I say that.

01:26:35.447 --> 01:26:38.030
Is it just me,
or is this kinda bad?

01:26:38.032 --> 01:26:39.242
Oh, yeah, it's bad.

01:26:54.215 --> 01:26:55.800
It's still going?

01:26:58.802 --> 01:27:03.015
Why, Lisa? Why, Lisa?
Please talk to me, please!

01:27:04.975 --> 01:27:08.102
You're part of my life.
You're everything.

01:27:08.104 --> 01:27:10.315
You are lying. I never hit you.

01:27:10.648 --> 01:27:13.482
You are tearing me apart, Lisa!

01:27:13.484 --> 01:27:15.526
Why are you so hysterical?

01:27:15.528 --> 01:27:17.780
You understand why? Do you?

01:27:23.661 --> 01:27:24.744
Where's my money?

01:27:24.746 --> 01:27:26.663
Where's my fucking money, Denny?

01:27:28.749 --> 01:27:32.127
You have no idea what kind of
trouble you're in here, do you?

01:27:32.503 --> 01:27:34.963
- I owe him some money.
- What kind of money?

01:27:35.506 --> 01:27:37.466
What kind of money?

01:27:39.802 --> 01:27:41.054
- Go.
- Go deep!

01:27:44.599 --> 01:27:47.433
I did not hit her.
It's not true. It's bullshit.

01:27:47.435 --> 01:27:48.809
I did not hit her.

01:27:48.811 --> 01:27:51.312
I did not!

01:27:51.314 --> 01:27:52.354
Oh, hi, Mark.

01:28:07.663 --> 01:28:10.372
- Don't worry about it, man.
- Don't touch me, mother fucker.

01:28:10.374 --> 01:28:11.040
Get out.

01:28:11.042 --> 01:28:12.042
Stop it!

01:28:14.796 --> 01:28:17.548
I'll kill you. I'll break every
bone in your body.

01:28:20.135 --> 01:28:22.762
Bastard! You betray me.
You're not good.

01:28:27.684 --> 01:28:28.598
If you'd keep your
girl satisfied,

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.559
she wouldn't come to me!

01:28:30.561 --> 01:28:31.688
Get outta my house.

01:28:34.481 --> 01:28:35.857
You couldn't kill me
if you tried.

01:28:35.859 --> 01:28:38.401
It's not over.
Everybody betray me.

01:28:38.403 --> 01:28:40.238
I fed up with the world.

01:28:47.244 --> 01:28:48.244
Hey, Tommy.

01:28:49.329 --> 01:28:50.329
They hate it.

01:28:51.916 --> 01:28:52.916
No.

01:28:53.877 --> 01:28:56.713
No. They're...
They're just laughing.

01:28:56.921 --> 01:28:57.922
Yeah. They're laughing.

01:28:58.381 --> 01:28:59.591
Laughing at me.

01:29:01.926 --> 01:29:04.093
Maybe it's true, you know.
Maybe everybody right.

01:29:04.095 --> 01:29:07.513
Maybe I just big joke. Ha, ha.

01:29:07.515 --> 01:29:08.515
No, Tommy...

01:29:09.266 --> 01:29:11.224
I try to open my heart,
show them my soul.

01:29:11.226 --> 01:29:13.313
And... they just hate me.

01:29:14.271 --> 01:29:15.648
Even you hate me, Greg.

01:29:21.029 --> 01:29:22.280
Hey, hey, hey.

01:29:23.782 --> 01:29:24.863
Listen to me, all right?

01:29:24.865 --> 01:29:27.866
All right, that thing out there,
that's your movie.

01:29:27.868 --> 01:29:28.868
You made that.

01:29:29.953 --> 01:29:32.015
All right, like you said,
you did that all by yourself.

01:29:32.039 --> 01:29:33.199
You know how special that is?

01:29:33.457 --> 01:29:35.960
Hey. It's fucking incredible.

01:29:36.627 --> 01:29:37.375
How many people can
say they have

01:29:37.377 --> 01:29:38.710
done something like that?

01:29:38.712 --> 01:29:39.922
I don't know.

01:29:40.465 --> 01:29:41.466
One thousand.

01:29:41.882 --> 01:29:42.924
All right, and yeah.

01:29:42.926 --> 01:29:45.300
Maybe it didn't turn out
exactly as you hoped.

01:29:45.302 --> 01:29:46.970
But just
listen for a second.

01:29:55.145 --> 01:29:56.355
Sound like they're laughing.

01:29:57.899 --> 01:29:58.941
All right, come here.

01:30:08.659 --> 01:30:09.993
Look how much fun
they're having.

01:30:11.162 --> 01:30:12.831
They fucking love it, man.

01:30:17.167 --> 01:30:20.001
Why, Lisa? Why, why?

01:30:26.010 --> 01:30:28.304
How often do you think Hitchcock
got a response like this?

01:30:30.014 --> 01:30:31.014
Never.

01:31:04.966 --> 01:31:05.966
Greg...

01:31:07.342 --> 01:31:08.385
Why you help me?

01:31:11.472 --> 01:31:12.515
'Cause we're friends.

01:31:14.850 --> 01:31:16.393
Why?

01:31:16.895 --> 01:31:19.061
Why is this happening to me?
Why?

01:31:19.063 --> 01:31:20.565
Here we go. "Why?"

01:31:22.566 --> 01:31:23.693
It's over.

01:31:27.739 --> 01:31:28.782
God.

01:31:30.033 --> 01:31:31.115
Do it!

01:31:32.743 --> 01:31:36.079
Do it! Do it!

01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:02.731
Tommy!

01:32:05.234 --> 01:32:06.234
Get up there. Go, man.

01:32:30.051 --> 01:32:31.051
Okay.

01:32:32.095 --> 01:32:33.095
Wow.

01:32:33.471 --> 01:32:35.640
I'm glad you liked
my comedic movie.

01:32:36.265 --> 01:32:38.016
Exactly how I intend it.

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:42.980
You know, I have vision
for this movie.

01:32:43.898 --> 01:32:44.898
But...

01:32:46.316 --> 01:32:47.777
I never make this movie...

01:32:48.987 --> 01:32:49.987
without my friend.

01:32:50.738 --> 01:32:52.365
We followed our dream.

01:32:54.658 --> 01:32:56.159
Come down here, Baby Face.

01:32:59.997 --> 01:33:01.373
Come on, Baby Face!

01:33:16.514 --> 01:33:19.641
I never be able to make this
movie without my best friend.

01:33:20.685 --> 01:33:22.061
We do it together.

01:33:22.645 --> 01:33:24.522
Okay. The Room!

01:34:06.730 --> 01:34:07.730
Okay.

01:35:01.034 --> 01:35:02.994
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

01:35:02.996 --> 01:35:05.457
Yeah. Can I have a dozen
red roses, please?

01:35:05.747 --> 01:35:07.347
Oh, hi, Johnny. I didn't know
it was you.

01:35:08.126 --> 01:35:10.628
Everything goes wrong at once.

01:35:10.795 --> 01:35:12.879
Nobody wants to help me.

01:35:12.881 --> 01:35:14.173
And I'm dying.

01:35:36.654 --> 01:35:38.615
Stop, no, stop.

01:35:42.577 --> 01:35:43.828
I can't talk right now.

01:35:44.162 --> 01:35:48.333
Why, Lisa, why, Lisa?
Please talk to me. Please.

01:35:48.999 --> 01:35:50.333
You're part of my life.

01:35:50.335 --> 01:35:53.755
You're everything. I could not
go on without you, Lisa.

01:35:58.842 --> 01:36:01.011
I mean, the candles.

01:36:01.679 --> 01:36:02.846
The music.

01:36:03.515 --> 01:36:06.810
The sexy dress.
I mean, what's going on here?

01:36:07.435 --> 01:36:09.187
You're not dying, Mom.

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.853
I got the results of
the test back.

01:36:11.855 --> 01:36:14.816
I definitely have breast cancer.

01:36:14.818 --> 01:36:16.942
You have nice legs, Lisa.

01:36:16.944 --> 01:36:19.488
You have nice pecs.

01:36:21.157 --> 01:36:26.203
I'm tired. I'm wasted.
I love you, darling.

01:36:26.703 --> 01:36:28.206
Come on, make love to me.

01:36:28.622 --> 01:36:31.708
Come on, you owe me one.

01:36:34.837 --> 01:36:36.213
I love you, Lisa.

01:36:36.881 --> 01:36:37.881
- Go.
- Go deep!

01:36:43.471 --> 01:36:45.345
Gee, Peter, you're clumsy.

01:36:45.347 --> 01:36:48.725
That's it, I'm done.
Good idea, Denny.

01:36:53.856 --> 01:36:56.859
I like you. Very much.

01:36:57.569 --> 01:36:59.737
Lover boy.

01:37:00.363 --> 01:37:01.905
What are you doing this for?

01:37:03.574 --> 01:37:04.575
What's the matter?

01:37:05.909 --> 01:37:06.911
Don't you like me?

01:37:08.496 --> 01:37:09.538
I'm your girl.

01:37:15.837 --> 01:37:18.004
Johnny's my best friend.

01:37:18.006 --> 01:37:20.091
Right. You're getting married
next month, come on.

01:37:20.925 --> 01:37:22.217
You're scaring me.

01:37:22.719 --> 01:37:25.096
You are lying. I never hit you.

01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:28.097
You are tearing me apart, Lisa!

01:37:28.099 --> 01:37:29.807
Why are you so hysterical?

01:37:29.809 --> 01:37:31.478
Do you understand why?

01:37:32.353 --> 01:37:33.353
Do you?

01:37:40.110 --> 01:37:43.403
I did not hit her.
It's not true. It's bullshit.

01:37:43.405 --> 01:37:44.781
I did not hit her.

01:37:44.783 --> 01:37:46.698
I did not!

01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:48.241
Oh, hi, Mark.

01:42:21.975 --> 01:42:22.975
Hey, how you doing?

01:42:23.853 --> 01:42:25.896
Hi. Yeah, I'm fine. Why you ask?

01:42:26.355 --> 01:42:27.854
Why you standing
against the wall?

01:42:27.856 --> 01:42:31.067
Look, I'm just a guy leaning
against wall, no big deal.

01:42:31.069 --> 01:42:32.149
Why you so lonely? Tell me.

01:42:33.238 --> 01:42:34.821
What, I'm just standing here alone.
Don't mean I'm lonely.

01:42:34.823 --> 01:42:35.983
You need help. I... I see it.

01:42:36.198 --> 01:42:38.075
It's not pity party.
This just party.

01:42:38.408 --> 01:42:40.242
- You wanna go with me?
- Go where?

01:42:40.244 --> 01:42:41.244
My house.

01:42:42.538 --> 01:42:43.995
I'm not going anywhere with you.

01:42:43.997 --> 01:42:45.540
You think you have long hair,
you own the world?

01:42:45.542 --> 01:42:46.540
That's the idea?

01:42:46.542 --> 01:42:48.127
I stop you.
I stop you right there.

01:42:48.752 --> 01:42:50.585
What is this accent?
It sound familiar.

01:42:50.587 --> 01:42:52.964
- You from New Orleans?
- Yeah. So what?

01:42:52.966 --> 01:42:54.464
- So what?
- What parish?

01:42:54.466 --> 01:42:56.299
- Chalmette.
- I love New Orleans.

01:42:56.301 --> 01:42:58.135
- You know where Chalmette?
- Yeah.

01:42:58.137 --> 01:42:59.137
Okay, cool.

01:42:59.514 --> 01:43:00.714
You want a drink or something?

01:43:01.056 --> 01:43:03.014
No. I'm not...
I'm not thirsty either.

01:43:03.016 --> 01:43:04.224
I just want to stand here.

01:43:04.226 --> 01:43:06.102
What's your name? Tommy, right?

01:43:06.104 --> 01:43:09.021
Yeah. My name Tommy
with capital go away.

01:43:09.023 --> 01:43:10.941
It's okay. Have a nice one.

01:43:11.609 --> 01:43:12.986
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:43:13.194 --> 01:43:14.279
Okay. Bye.

01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:16.070
'Kay.

01:43:16.823 --> 01:43:18.281
People are very
strange these day.

01:43:18.283 --> 01:43:19.283
Oh, hi, Betty.

01:43:21.202 --> 01:43:22.202
My God.

01:43:24.913 --> 01:43:26.291
What these friends Greg have.
