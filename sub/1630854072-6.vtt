01:45.105 --> 01:47.774
<i>Good morning, Night City!</i>

01:47.857 --> 01:52.028
<i>Rise and shine</i>
<i>for a new day in the City of Dreams…</i>

01:52.612 --> 01:54.739
<i>Gonna be late to work again today.</i>

01:54.823 --> 01:57.867
<i>We've got gonks dreaming</i>
<i>of becoming the next Weyland Boa Boa</i>

01:57.951 --> 02:01.412
<i>jamming up traffic for the rest of us!</i>

02:04.332 --> 02:07.919
<i>What is it about this City</i>
<i>that keeps attracting…</i>

02:08.503 --> 02:10.255
<i>Never fear the risk!</i>

02:16.511 --> 02:18.721
<i>That's right…</i>

02:23.518 --> 02:25.186
<i>It's…</i>

02:25.270 --> 02:26.187
<i>Maine.</i>

02:26.271 --> 02:29.691
When did you last snarf anything? Here.

02:36.156 --> 02:40.368
Damn it, you're shaking. All that chrome's
messing with your nerves.

02:40.451 --> 02:44.330
When this is all over, gotta refit,
go lights back, reduce your load.

02:44.414 --> 02:47.584
It's just some jitters.
There's nothing to worry about.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.295
You can't keep this up, babe.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.379
Fuck that.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.340
A little metal ain't gonna be enough to--

02:55.466 --> 02:56.593
<i>Maine?</i>

02:56.676 --> 02:58.344
Hey! Maine!

02:58.428 --> 03:02.599
Fuck off! Ain't nobody
gonna set my limits but me.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.101
<i>Made it this goddamn far without trouble.</i>

03:05.185 --> 03:07.478
<i>I ain't about to backtrack now!</i>

03:07.562 --> 03:09.105
<i>Where's our fucking data?</i>

03:09.189 --> 03:11.232
<i>Kiwi's mid-dive, can't rush her.</i>
<i>You know that!</i>

03:17.071 --> 03:20.200
ICE is harder to break through
than I thought it'll be.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.924
Maine! Stop! Shit! What're you…

03:36.007 --> 03:37.008
Hey!

03:42.180 --> 03:44.766
Kiwi? Falco?

03:46.392 --> 03:48.978
You back with us?

03:49.062 --> 03:50.271
-Dorio?
-Shit…

03:50.355 --> 03:53.775
What gives? What the hell happened?
We got jumped?

03:54.859 --> 03:56.778
And what happened to Kiwi--

03:58.863 --> 04:02.200
<i>The forecast</i>
<i>shows heavy rainfall along the coast.</i>

04:02.283 --> 04:04.285
<i>Districts like Santo Domingo</i>
<i>and Westbrook</i>

04:04.369 --> 04:06.913
<i>are most heavily affected</i>
<i>and are likely to see showers</i>

04:06.996 --> 04:08.623
<i>from midnight to sunrise…</i>

04:08.706 --> 04:10.416
<i>So take the proper precautions.</i>

04:12.752 --> 04:15.713
What the fuck, Falco?
You can't just drop by and not…

04:16.547 --> 04:19.259
Ask Maine? Why? You're here.

04:19.342 --> 04:22.220
So just tell me… Hey! Huh?

04:27.642 --> 04:30.019
-I can't believe this shit.
-Huh?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.730
You're saying Kiwi's out of commission?
How?

04:32.814 --> 04:34.857
She was working Tanaka, right?

04:34.941 --> 04:36.442
Something go way south?

04:36.526 --> 04:38.236
You should ask the gonk next to me.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.195
Fuck off.

04:40.363 --> 04:44.742
Maine punched her out when she ran
into some ICE that snagged her. Lost it.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.578
-Huh?
-To me, Maine needs his head checked.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.957
Easy, Maine, if you start losing it--

04:56.254 --> 04:57.088
Hey…

04:57.672 --> 04:58.798
"Losing it"?

04:58.881 --> 05:01.092
That's right. Cyberpsychosis.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.353
Maine, hold up!

05:12.437 --> 05:13.563
Uh… Hey.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.483
Dorio just told me. You know… But…

05:18.067 --> 05:20.528
You're gonna be all right, right?
You're not gonna end up like--

05:20.611 --> 05:21.779
All right?

05:22.447 --> 05:25.491
What's that mean, "all right"? Huh, kid?

05:25.575 --> 05:27.618
Not a cyber psycho?

05:28.953 --> 05:31.247
What? You think I might be losing my grip?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.623
Maine, I didn't mean to--

05:32.707 --> 05:35.335
Give me a solid, lay off.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.670
Mind your own biz for a fucking change.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.926
Think you're hot shit
because you're faster than me?

05:44.010 --> 05:46.012
Because you're sporting a Sandevistan?

05:46.095 --> 05:48.639
Well, that was supposed to be mine.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.522
I already made it this far.

05:56.606 --> 06:01.027
I won't do it. Ain't no way
I'm gonna start downgrading. Not now.

06:01.652 --> 06:04.655
Can't stop hunting. No turning back.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.659
NCPD probably
snooped out our trail already.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.912
We only got until morning, if that.

06:10.995 --> 06:11.996
You hearing me?

06:12.080 --> 06:13.664
I told you no!

06:13.748 --> 06:16.209
You're the one that needs to listen!

06:16.292 --> 06:19.045
He's Arasaka…

06:20.546 --> 06:22.298
Let's call it off.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.425
Let's go home, Lucy.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.177
Don't gotta do nothing if you don't wanna.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.512
Stay out of this, David!

06:27.595 --> 06:29.680
We can drop Tanaka where we nabbed him.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.432
Pretend none of this happened
from the start.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.351
You better knock it off!

06:33.434 --> 06:35.228
Hey! I'm not done with you!

06:36.562 --> 06:38.940
David… Tell me I can do it.

06:39.023 --> 06:42.068
-What… But I thought you didn't wanna--
-Say it!

06:42.151 --> 06:43.611
You…

06:43.694 --> 06:46.239
You don't get it. You don't understand.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.615
We can't just leave.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.660
Arasaka is always watching.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.870
Always. We can't just call it off.

06:53.454 --> 06:57.333
We don't have a choice. I know that.
I just…

06:58.042 --> 07:00.503
I need to hear you say it.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.463
Please…

07:05.758 --> 07:09.387
Look. I'm sorry. But I…

07:10.096 --> 07:11.848
I need you to do this.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.268
I believe in you, Lucy.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.605
-Fine. I'll do it.
-What?

07:19.689 --> 07:21.607
But David has to come with me.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.693
And Maine? He can't be in the room.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.112
My conditions. Take it or leave it.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.241
Fine. Whatever.

07:30.324 --> 07:34.120
But you'll have to keep us in the loop.
Ping us every quarter hour.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.455
You've got until dawn.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.248
Don't fuck this up!

07:38.291 --> 07:40.751
David! Where's the lead head?

07:43.713 --> 07:44.881
<i>Hell, if I know.</i>

07:52.847 --> 07:54.098
Maine!

07:56.809 --> 07:58.352
Huh?

07:58.436 --> 07:59.395
Dorio…

08:00.646 --> 08:03.649
Hey, wouldn't it be safer
to have Dorio as backup?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.234
Grow a spine.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.360
Like why didn't you…

08:07.820 --> 08:09.906
You could've told me earlier.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.283
And I don't get it,
why we gotta do this alone?

08:12.366 --> 08:13.743
David.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.711
Can I ask you something?

08:25.004 --> 08:27.340
Uh, deep-dive port…

08:27.423 --> 08:30.176
Why did you hide it? Keep it a secret?

08:35.223 --> 08:36.098
Jacking in now…

08:40.311 --> 08:41.521
David…

08:41.604 --> 08:42.647
Yeah?

08:45.066 --> 08:46.275
I'm going in.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.781
<i>The fact that there's a trap here</i>

08:51.864 --> 08:54.659
<i>means there's gotta be a way</i>
<i>to get inside.</i>

09:05.461 --> 09:08.297
<i>Alright, okay. Maine. Where's he?</i>

09:08.381 --> 09:09.882
<i>Maine? Cooling off.</i>

09:10.716 --> 09:13.636
<i>Hey, Dorio… You sure we gotta…</i>

09:13.719 --> 09:16.639
<i>-Huh?</i>
<i>-No, forget it. Never mind.</i>

09:19.976 --> 09:21.269
Are we gonna kill him?

09:22.144 --> 09:25.106
We need a Plan B
just in case she doesn't make it.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.858
Plan A, B, or Z.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.111
It should've never have to come to this.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.363
Huh?

09:33.447 --> 09:35.157
<i>Yeah, what? What do you want?</i>

09:35.241 --> 09:36.867
<i>The data. Do you have it?</i>

09:36.951 --> 09:38.119
<i>We're working on it.</i>

09:38.202 --> 09:41.747
<i>A delay? Who's this on?</i>

09:41.831 --> 09:43.708
<i>Christ, what? Twenty questions?</i>

09:43.791 --> 09:46.502
<i>Transparency, Maine. What you, we agreed.</i>

09:46.586 --> 09:47.753
<i>Huh?</i>

09:47.837 --> 09:50.006
<i>And Kiwi? Can you do it without her?</i>

09:50.089 --> 09:52.758
<i>How… Shit. Falco talked.</i>

09:53.509 --> 09:56.429
<i>You're willing to bet everything</i>
<i>on a backup runner?</i>

09:56.512 --> 09:57.763
<i>Absolutely.</i>

09:57.847 --> 09:59.348
<i>Tick tock, Maine.</i>

09:59.432 --> 10:01.892
<i>Arasake is still short one executive.</i>

10:01.976 --> 10:04.812
<i>I trust you understand.</i>
<i>There is no room for error.</i>

10:04.895 --> 10:06.188
<i>Made that clear.</i>

10:07.815 --> 10:09.025
What?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.777
The fuck you staring at, Faraday?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.204
<i>It's glitching out…</i>

10:22.288 --> 10:25.207
Shit, really? Now of all times!

10:29.003 --> 10:32.089
Wait… Wait, please!

10:32.173 --> 10:33.341
David!

10:36.302 --> 10:38.846
Maine! Snap out of it!

10:38.929 --> 10:40.097
Hey!

10:40.848 --> 10:43.225
<i>He's waking up!</i>

10:44.226 --> 10:45.561
<i>What are you doing, David?</i>

10:51.525 --> 10:54.987
I was right, it was you… You're David…

10:55.571 --> 10:56.739
You know my name?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.743
There is much I know about you.

11:00.826 --> 11:04.622
The incident of my son at the Academy…

11:06.957 --> 11:07.833
Despite that,

11:07.917 --> 11:11.170
I was the one who insisted
that you be readmitted at once.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.421
You did?

11:12.505 --> 11:16.926
Please, David.
You can help to stop all of this.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.762
I'm begging you. I do not wish to die.

11:19.845 --> 11:23.641
-We just need the data. We're not--
-You're so naive, boy!

11:25.184 --> 11:26.894
I've seen their faces!

11:26.977 --> 11:29.647
You think Arasaka won't hunt them down?

11:30.731 --> 11:35.111
Just think. Why would I revoke
your expulsion after what happened?

11:35.194 --> 11:38.406
You have demonstrated unique potential.

11:38.489 --> 11:41.659
Arasaka sees in you a valuable asset.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.913
A rich, bright future awaits you, David!

11:45.996 --> 11:48.040
Do not throw your life away!

11:58.384 --> 11:59.802
<i>Bingo.</i>

12:11.272 --> 12:13.441
I can't let you go. I just can't.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.985
Then get in contact with Arasaka.

12:16.068 --> 12:19.029
This madness can all be over
in less than five minutes.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.865
That's not what I mean!

12:20.948 --> 12:22.324
I can't do that to my crew.

12:22.408 --> 12:26.328
Foolish boy!
Can you not see that they're using you?

12:26.412 --> 12:28.831
And Arasaka won't?

12:28.914 --> 12:29.915
<i>You are blind.</i>

12:29.999 --> 12:34.712
<i>You still don't get it. Who do you think</i>
<i>paid to make your stunt possible?</i>

12:34.795 --> 12:38.591
<i>It is the Militech.</i>
<i>All roads lead to the megacorps.</i>

12:38.674 --> 12:41.886
No matter how high you rise,
or you believe you can,

12:41.969 --> 12:44.930
you will never escape our shadow.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.098
But that's…

13:05.075 --> 13:06.494
David, you there?

13:07.578 --> 13:10.790
Martinez. Tell me…

13:10.873 --> 13:14.251
Just tell me what is it you want?

13:14.835 --> 13:16.295
What I want?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.134
-David! What the fuck is this?
-Why is he awake?

13:22.718 --> 13:25.012
Where's the damn tranq… Get him!

13:26.847 --> 13:28.766
What? The fuck was that?

13:28.849 --> 13:30.226
No!

13:30.309 --> 13:32.102
He kicks it! This is over!

13:32.186 --> 13:33.062
Hey, David!

13:33.145 --> 13:36.690
Snap out of it, damn it!
You were the one who got her in, right?

13:36.774 --> 13:38.400
So yank her out!

13:38.984 --> 13:41.278
Dorio!
Lucy's still stuck in deep-dive!

13:41.362 --> 13:44.031
-Are you kidding me?
-Come on, hurry! Just cut the link!

13:46.075 --> 13:47.785
Okay! Pull her now!

14:01.465 --> 14:02.633
How's the data?

14:02.716 --> 14:04.885
You jabbed him after he flatlined
so it's probably fine.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.055
David!

14:08.138 --> 14:09.640
Yeah, Lucy's all right…

14:12.351 --> 14:15.521
Start talking!
What the fuck were you thinking?

14:16.313 --> 14:20.401
Me? What the fuck were you thinking?
Were you doing?

14:20.484 --> 14:22.069
What the hell did you say?

14:22.152 --> 14:25.573
Punching out Kiwi.
Dropping all this shit on Lucy.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.117
You were the one fucking around. The fuck!

14:28.200 --> 14:29.910
Don't you start, kid.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.412
Maine! David!

14:31.495 --> 14:34.290
Jammer got fried when Tanaka flatlined!

14:34.373 --> 14:36.625
The Trauma Team caught the fucking sig!

14:36.709 --> 14:37.918
Motherfuck!

14:40.379 --> 14:42.506
David, we got-- You hear me?

14:42.590 --> 14:45.175
-Now prepare the wheels! Quick!
-[crashing[

14:45.259 --> 14:47.761
Get it together, David!

14:47.845 --> 14:49.805
You signed up for this shit, do it!

14:51.599 --> 14:53.893
Wait in the ride. We'll catch up.

14:53.976 --> 14:54.894
Got it!

14:57.354 --> 14:59.398
Fucking Platinum premium plan service…

14:59.481 --> 15:00.941
Dorio!

15:05.487 --> 15:07.907
<i>Registering gunfire</i>
<i>in the service area.</i>

15:07.990 --> 15:09.950
<i>Possible hostiles present.</i>

15:10.034 --> 15:12.620
<i>Requesting NCPD backup in force.</i>

15:23.923 --> 15:27.718
-David?
-Lucy! You okay?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.554
What's going on? What happened?

15:30.638 --> 15:32.848
Tanaka came too, then he short-circuited

15:32.932 --> 15:35.225
for some reason.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.728
Something strange happen
while you were under?

15:37.811 --> 15:39.730
Maine and Dorio, where are they?

15:39.813 --> 15:41.398
They're already moving Tanaka.

15:42.524 --> 15:43.359
But he's dead.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.695
-We saved him.
-What? Why?

15:46.779 --> 15:49.031
What do you mean?
We still need the data.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.241
But there's no point. Tanaka was a bust!

15:52.201 --> 15:54.286
There was no data.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.247
<i>It can't be…</i>

15:57.998 --> 16:00.626
Fuck. We're definitely
on Arasaka's radar now.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.879
Maine! Your meds!
Don't forget them.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.798
Just took a shot!

16:05.881 --> 16:06.840
Don't move!

16:14.848 --> 16:19.144
Fuck! Why's NCPD always fast
when it comes to us?

16:20.020 --> 16:21.647
Back up! Go to the back!

16:23.232 --> 16:25.317
Shit! He won't pick up!

16:26.235 --> 16:27.152
David!

16:27.236 --> 16:29.405
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to help them.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.032
Dumbass!
What if they slip out another way?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.283
We wait here.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.585
-No! I can't wait!
-David!

16:43.669 --> 16:47.256
What's got you so spooked?
They should be back now. Something's off.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.967
Wait! I got another sig.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.053
Not just NCPD. Trauma's here too.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.055
It means they're surrounded.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.140
Then we gotta help.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.308
No, you can't!
You got a death wish?

17:06.400 --> 17:09.486
It'll be okay. I'll come back.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.487
Listen…

17:10.571 --> 17:13.615
The situation looks bad,
no matter how you slice it.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.242
We need to cut our losses and run.

17:15.325 --> 17:18.328
You hear them fighting, don't you?
They're still alive in there!

17:20.039 --> 17:22.541
You're sure not acting yourself today,
Lucy.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.710
You saw something in there, didn't you?

17:24.793 --> 17:25.961
In Tanaka's neural net…

17:26.045 --> 17:29.131
I just… I only wanted …

17:30.591 --> 17:32.342
Lucy?

17:33.135 --> 17:34.344
Aren't you gonna say

17:34.428 --> 17:36.263
that you believe in me, too?

17:56.158 --> 17:57.242
The fuck you doing, Maine?

17:57.826 --> 17:58.911
Get it together…

18:04.458 --> 18:06.752
Shit! That fucking gonk…

18:12.424 --> 18:14.384
-<i>Hold your fire!</i>
-<i>Huh?</i>

18:14.468 --> 18:16.345
<i>He's got a platinum client hostage!</i>

18:16.428 --> 18:17.262
<i>Not our problem!</i>

18:45.666 --> 18:46.875
Dorio…

18:46.959 --> 18:50.129
<i>Maine… I'm on my way.</i>

18:51.421 --> 18:53.382
<i>Just…</i>

18:53.465 --> 18:55.634
<i>Just tell me I can do this.</i>

19:07.437 --> 19:10.858
Is this… Is this my fault?

19:19.032 --> 19:22.661
Freeze! Weapons down,
hands behind your head!

19:23.328 --> 19:24.246
Last warning!

19:33.839 --> 19:35.966
Platinum client confirmed dead.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.676
Hey.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.428
This mess my fault?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.973
It's cyberpsychosis!

19:43.056 --> 19:46.185
-Flag MaxTac now…
-He's killing us!

19:48.770 --> 19:51.481
Client has flatlined. Evacuate!

19:51.565 --> 19:53.066
What the fuck, we're leaving?

19:53.150 --> 19:54.443
Client policy's void!

19:54.526 --> 19:57.446
-This is your problem now!
-Fuck that!

19:57.529 --> 19:58.989
He's here! Let's go!

20:18.592 --> 20:20.802
Shit!

20:29.311 --> 20:31.146
<i>David… You're hearing me?</i>

20:31.230 --> 20:33.148
<i>Maine's gone full psycho.</i>

20:33.732 --> 20:37.277
<i>They've called in MaxTac.</i>
<i>Turn around. Come back…</i>

20:38.695 --> 20:39.613
Maine…

20:40.656 --> 20:43.283
Oh. Hey, kid.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.160
You holding up alright?

20:45.244 --> 20:49.039
Maine, I came to back you up…

20:49.122 --> 20:50.582
Dorio's dead.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.293
-She didn't make it.
-Huh?

20:54.503 --> 20:56.546
What are you doing?

20:56.630 --> 20:59.049
The last thing I can do for her.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.636
We gotta Delta.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.179
Or we'll end up like her!

21:05.097 --> 21:07.432
No more running for me, doug.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.185
The reaper's finally calling my name.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.688
What are you saying?

21:16.275 --> 21:20.070
It's okay. I'll fight with you.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.571
David…

21:21.655 --> 21:25.575
I've made up my mind. I got your back!
I'm getting you out of this, Maine!

21:27.869 --> 21:29.830
Damn it! Stop shaking!

21:29.913 --> 21:33.500
MaxTac, you freak! Come and get us!
Just fucking try!

21:33.583 --> 21:37.546
I want to save you.
We're getting out of here, Maine.

21:37.629 --> 21:40.590
You and me. And then…

22:01.445 --> 22:02.988
David.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.868
You can't do it.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.123
I don't… Why would you…

22:14.166 --> 22:15.125
Why…

22:25.510 --> 22:26.678
This is it.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.933
It's the end of the line for me.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.895
But not for you.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.647
Fast is what you do best, ain't it?

22:38.815 --> 22:40.150
Just keep running.
