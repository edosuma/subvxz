00:06.006 --> 00:07.799
<i>Many, many revolutions ago,</i>

00:07.799 --> 00:10.928
<i>our super-super-super-lifegivers
discovered the ability</i>

00:10.928 --> 00:15.390
<i>to stain our outer layers with images
and symbols that could last forever.</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:18.018
<i>Sometimes, they are meant
to ward off dubious spirits.</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:21.063
<i>Sometimes,
they are a tribute to a being we love.</i>

00:21.063 --> 00:24.691
<i>While other times,
they symbolize a trip to a faraway island</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:26.860
<i>while on a short break
from your learnstitution.</i>

00:26.860 --> 00:30.656
<i>It is an honor to bestow a being
with a lifelong ink stain.</i>

00:30.656 --> 00:33.200
And one day,
you will bring many beings great joy

00:33.200 --> 00:35.160
by carrying on this special tradition.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.413
That's why we already added you up there.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.290
We know you'll wanna take it over

00:40.290 --> 00:43.377
and keep it in the family
for many revolutions to come.

00:44.628 --> 00:45.629
Yay!

00:52.928 --> 00:55.681
<i>Here's our orb
It's slightly leaning</i>

00:55.681 --> 00:57.474
<i>Orbiting a star</i>

00:58.225 --> 01:00.894
<i>We find ways to give life meaning</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:02.521
<i>Some might seem bizarre</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:05.732
<i>All we know is that we exist</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:08.694
<i>And it won't be for long
So it helps to put some foot tubes on</i>

01:08.694 --> 01:11.029
<i>Joy and sadness, courage and fear</i>

01:11.029 --> 01:13.699
<i>Curiosity and anger
On a planet full of danger</i>

01:13.699 --> 01:15.909
<i>And it's only getting stranger
From here</i>

01:28.630 --> 01:30.382
- Apologies.
- Hey.

01:31.175 --> 01:32.009
Hi!

01:32.968 --> 01:33.802
Normal voice.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.012
Hi.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.306
Are you going to visit Cocoslab Island?

01:38.307 --> 01:40.517
No. Maybe. I don't know.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.187
I applied to a learnstitution there.

01:43.187 --> 01:46.690
But you're so smart.
What else do you need to learn?

01:46.690 --> 01:50.110
They have one of the best
hospitality programs on the whole orb.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.405
I doubt I'll even get in.
Anyway, what are you doing here?

01:54.448 --> 01:57.409
I was just perusing
for a new book to read.

01:57.409 --> 02:00.621
"A chance encounter leads
to a day of falling in l-love."

02:01.205 --> 02:03.498
How romantic.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.416
Yeah.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.044
Even though these novels aren't realistic,

02:07.044 --> 02:11.256
they give me hope that I too can find
a deeper connection with a being someday.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.425
That is the dream, isn't it?

02:13.425 --> 02:16.094
Why is it so difficult to find that being?

02:16.595 --> 02:18.597
Because it is so easy
to get in your own way

02:18.597 --> 02:20.974
and cause so much anxiety that you puke.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.478
Well, I better continue on.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.480
I have to swing by the currency dispenser

02:26.480 --> 02:28.649
to see if I still have currency
to dispense.

02:29.858 --> 02:34.238
That's fun.
I hope you have plenty of currency.

02:34.238 --> 02:37.407
Are you busy?
Would you maybe want to accompany me?

02:37.407 --> 02:39.451
I would like that. Yes.

02:41.787 --> 02:46.959
It's about precision and a gentle touch.

02:47.543 --> 02:48.710
And recognizing

02:48.710 --> 02:50.504
that even if something is forever,

02:50.504 --> 02:55.217
it is always possible to change it
into something else that is forever.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.386
And done.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.721
Keep your ink stain
out of direct starlight.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.057
Clean it twice a day. See ya next time.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.644
What's wrong, my tiny creature?

03:05.644 --> 03:06.854
What? Nothing.

03:06.854 --> 03:11.400
Uh-uh, a lifegiver can always sense when
something is upsetting their offspring.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.902
I just--
I don't wanna work here all the time.

03:13.902 --> 03:18.448
Well, that's easy to understand.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.951
We can offer you fewer hours each week

03:20.951 --> 03:24.538
so you can spend more time with beings
that are similar in revolutions to you.

03:25.122 --> 03:28.584
As long as they don't inhale mild poison
behind the tiny grocery mart.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.627
No, I mean,
I don't wanna work here at all.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.629
I don't wanna take over the business.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.590
I don't wanna give beings ink stains.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.551
My head must still have liquid in it
from my stand-up-rinse-off this morning,

03:37.551 --> 03:41.013
because I thought I heard you say
you don't wanna be an ink stain creator.

03:41.013 --> 03:44.766
This ink stain salon has played
a very important role in Beingsburg.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.186
Our ink stains have honored
some of the most important events

03:47.186 --> 03:49.146
this burg has ever witnessed.

03:49.146 --> 03:53.525
Look here. This being won
the first Beingsburg Long Limb Run,

03:53.525 --> 03:57.279
and my super-super-lifegiver stained him
to commemorate the accomplishment.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.823
Tell them about this being, dear.

04:01.450 --> 04:05.454
They drank too much mild poison
and asked for this very unusual ink stain.

04:05.454 --> 04:08.415
Which we were happy to artfully oblige.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.793
Considering the ask,
that's pleasant to look at.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.046
Look, I know this all means a lot to you,

04:14.046 --> 04:16.173
but it doesn't mean as much to me.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.632
Apologies.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.635
You don't need to offer apologies, Offspring.

04:19.635 --> 04:22.053
No. But you do have to work here.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.850
Would you really leave Careful Now?

04:28.310 --> 04:30.938
I guess. I mean, I like my job.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.314
It pays me adequate earnings,

04:32.314 --> 04:34.358
and I can eat anything
that has fallen on the ground

04:34.358 --> 04:36.235
for more than five seconds,

04:36.235 --> 04:38.695
but I suppose I would have to.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.364
I see.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.324
But I have to get in first.

04:42.324 --> 04:43.617
I'm sure you'll get in.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.495
You have so much experience.
And a great work ethic.

04:46.495 --> 04:49.748
Plus, you always remember
that I don't like soap leaf.

04:49.748 --> 04:53.710
Gratitude, but I prefer
to keep my expectations low,

04:53.710 --> 04:55.170
so I don't become disappointed.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.882
That is one
of our significant differences,

04:58.882 --> 05:00.467
besides you loving vibrating creatures

05:00.467 --> 05:03.011
and me being afraid
of them causing my lungs to collapse.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.888
I prefer to focus on the positive.

05:05.389 --> 05:09.017
When you do that, you start to see
more positive things all around you.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.396
Apologies, I don't have much to do today.
May I continue accompanying you?

05:12.396 --> 05:15.107
Of course. We have to finish this debate.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.109
I hear what you're saying,

05:17.109 --> 05:20.737
but wouldn't you rather be pleasantly
surprised than frequently disappointed?

05:22.906 --> 05:24.867
My lifegiver was a traveling salesbeing,

05:24.867 --> 05:27.119
so we moved around a lot
when I was smaller.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.079
I found that I had two choices.

05:29.079 --> 05:32.749
I could be disappointed to keep leaving
the friends and learnstitutions I liked,

05:33.250 --> 05:36.962
or I could be happy to meet new beings
and see new places around the orb.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.714
It was better to focus on happiness.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.676
But I was always the one who left first.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.053
No one I really cared about ever left me,

05:45.637 --> 05:49.391
so I will admit this is a strange feeling.

05:51.310 --> 05:53.312
So how did you end up in Beingsburg?

05:53.312 --> 05:56.565
My sibling moved here for their vocation
and spoke highly of the greenery.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.943
So, I followed them to pursue my passion
of landscape arts.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.486
Is that what you do?

06:01.486 --> 06:03.989
No. I currently sell habitats to beings

06:03.989 --> 06:06.074
until I can break through
the green ceiling.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.578
Think you'll stay for a while
or go see some new places around the orb?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.539
I think I'll be here a while.

06:12.539 --> 06:16.835
Surprisingly, I like the comfort of seeing
some of the same beings every day.

06:16.835 --> 06:17.753
Like you.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.966
I've also become very close
with your newest hire.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.970
They're not the most skillful employee,
but they have a lot of spirit.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.556
That's the nicest way to put it, yes.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.602
Here, I'm gonna make a wish.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.729
Do you think it'll come true?

06:35.729 --> 06:38.857
Do I think throwing a currency disk
into a basin of liquid

06:38.857 --> 06:41.568
has the magical power
to turn thoughts into reality?

06:41.568 --> 06:42.694
I don't think I do.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.573
I think it will.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.952
I don't understand.

06:49.952 --> 06:53.413
I spent all my revolutions working
to provide them with a secure future,

06:53.413 --> 06:56.500
and now it's as if I've been swatted
across the face.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.127
I knew we should've had more offspring
for this very reason.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.712
It's okay.

07:00.712 --> 07:04.341
If they really don't wanna work here,
I think we should listen to them.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.301
Well, what are they gonna do
for their vocation?

07:06.301 --> 07:08.428
Why don't you ask them?

07:09.012 --> 07:11.932
Don't raise your volume if you don't get
the answer you're seeking.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.643
Hi, Offspring.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.062
Have you thought more
about what we talked about?

07:17.062 --> 07:18.397
I haven't changed my mind.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.735
Lifegiver, I don't wanna work here.

07:23.735 --> 07:27.030
I'm terrible at ink staining,
and I don't find it fulfilling.

07:27.531 --> 07:32.077
I'm raising my volume because
this is not the answer I'm seeking!

07:32.077 --> 07:35.873
Why won't you support me in finding
a vocation that speaks to me?

07:35.873 --> 07:38.458
Vocations don't speak!

07:40.669 --> 07:42.796
What was the longest you ever lived
in one burg?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.840
Probably about two revolutions.

07:44.840 --> 07:45.924
That's it?

07:46.466 --> 07:49.261
- That's a lot of moving around.
- You get used to it.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.139
You start to realize everything
is temporary until you perish.

07:52.723 --> 07:56.685
Is that looking at the bright side?
I genuinely can't tell.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.187
I think so?

07:59.104 --> 08:03.609
I've been learning that the fleeting
nature of life helps my anxiety dissipate.

08:04.109 --> 08:07.237
It allows me to focus
on the positive aspects of each moment.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.740
You didn't seem like
you were able to focus on the positive

08:09.740 --> 08:12.451
when you turned
my vibrating creature pink.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.535
That is true.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.288
I'm better than I've been,
but I'm still anxious

08:16.288 --> 08:18.415
- about certain things.
- Like what?

08:18.415 --> 08:20.459
Like accidentally doing something

08:20.459 --> 08:22.878
that would make you not wanna spend time
with me anymore.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.465
Well, if the fleeting nature
of life makes you less anxious,

08:26.465 --> 08:29.468
why would you be worrying about
how temporary our friendship could be?

08:30.052 --> 08:31.929
Yeah. No, no, you're right.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.347
What a quandary. I--

08:34.847 --> 08:36.975
You know,
I guess all beings look for permanence,

08:36.975 --> 08:40.229
when the lack of permanence
is what makes life so interesting.

08:40.229 --> 08:43.232
It might be unrealistic,
but it's what gives us hope.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.571
I think that's why I got my ink stains.

08:49.571 --> 08:53.242
They give a sense of permanence
for experiences I never wanna forget.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.079
- How many ink stains do you have?
- Six.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.789
Three that I like, two that I regret,

08:58.789 --> 09:02.251
and one that I know I spent currency on,
but I cannot locate.

09:02.251 --> 09:03.502
Do you have a favorite?

09:03.502 --> 09:04.586
I really like this one.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.464
I got it while I was at the learnstitution
for meteorology.

09:07.464 --> 09:10.843
Because you see the rain clouds
before the star?

09:10.843 --> 09:13.011
Because there's a lot of beauty
in the rain.

09:13.011 --> 09:16.390
Plus, in my defense,
it did rain a ton the summer I got it.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.892
But you could've gone for the star.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.936
I'd rather be prepared for the rain.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.813
What if the rain doesn't come?

09:22.813 --> 09:26.692
The rain has to come eventually.
It is necessary for survival.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.697
I'm gonna prove my lifegivers wrong.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.449
There's plenty of things I could do
for a vocation,

09:34.449 --> 09:36.368
and I'm gonna find one at this fair.

09:37.536 --> 09:40.789
You look like you want
to plan beings' trips all over the orb!

09:40.789 --> 09:43.166
We pay unlimited single-serving jars
of jam.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.293
No, thank you.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.587
Interested in sitting in front of
an illuminated machine

09:46.587 --> 09:47.713
and click-clacking numbers?

09:47.713 --> 09:48.839
Yeah, maybe.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.382
Well, let's see how fast you can do it.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.562
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.191
How do you feel
about getting an ink stain?

10:07.191 --> 10:08.901
I would rather express myself
in other ways,

10:08.901 --> 10:12.613
like, I don't know,
singing or dancing or pottery.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.282
Do you sing or dance or do pottery?

10:15.282 --> 10:19.703
Not yet.
But that's how apprehensive I am about it.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.456
You are an interesting being.

10:22.456 --> 10:25.667
And I do mean "interesting" in a way
that suggests that you're unique.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.252
Thanks.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.797
The way you described
ink stains has me intrigued.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.841
I like that they capture a moment in time.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.761
So even if you regret one eventually,

10:35.761 --> 10:38.138
you'll always remember the circumstances
that led you to it.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.223
For better or for worse.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.974
- Yes.
- They mark your journey.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.392
Exactly!

10:42.392 --> 10:44.603
So, do you wanna get your first ink stain

10:44.603 --> 10:47.314
to commemorate your courage
in getting your first ink stain?

10:48.273 --> 10:49.274
Preferably not.

10:49.274 --> 10:53.237
But I'd consider it if that means
we can continue spending time together.

10:53.237 --> 10:57.199
Let's check it out. I could see something
maybe on your limb, right here.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.076
Like a soap leaf?

10:59.076 --> 11:00.327
Ha-ha!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.287
What? You don't like soap leaf?

11:05.040 --> 11:08.669
- Welcome! Do you like to shake your limbs?
- Yes.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.630
Do you like to shake them standing
behind other beings

11:11.630 --> 11:14.049
at various celebratory events?

11:14.049 --> 11:15.133
Maybe?

11:15.133 --> 11:17.135
Let me see you shake.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.806
- Now?
- Yeah, just a little somethin'.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.231
Needs work.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.408
I guess my lifegivers were right.

11:47.875 --> 11:51.003
<i>I keep it moving
This grouproll is nonstop</i>

11:51.003 --> 11:54.256
<i>Putting rhymes together
Like they were made of glomrocks</i>

11:56.008 --> 11:56.842
What?

11:56.842 --> 11:58.302
<i>It's magnetic</i>

11:58.302 --> 12:00.262
<i>It's freestyle
I can deliver</i>

12:00.262 --> 12:03.307
<i>I rap good
Someone please tell my lifegiver</i>

12:04.099 --> 12:05.851
- I like that a lot.
- Yeah.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.479
<i>I'm gonna catch it
And make it real smooth</i>

12:09.479 --> 12:12.357
<i>The improvised groove
Is now slightly improved</i>

12:12.858 --> 12:15.444
<i>Double Shadow Day
Can you handle the view?</i>

12:15.444 --> 12:17.487
<i>Let me come and share
The magic with you</i>

12:17.487 --> 12:18.614
So smooth!

12:18.614 --> 12:19.531
Rhyming couplets.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.408
<i>I'm Medallion</i>

12:21.408 --> 12:23.493
<i>More flavor than a scallion</i>

12:23.493 --> 12:29.416
<i>One, two, three, a-a-a thousand
Right now I'm rhyming, I'm surrounded</i>

12:29.416 --> 12:33.212
<i>Looking for one more rhyme
I-I found it</i>

12:38.634 --> 12:40.469
<i>I feel kinda nervous</i>

12:40.469 --> 12:42.429
<i>And I currently lack a purpose</i>

12:42.429 --> 12:44.556
<i>Maybe I should try
To rhyme some verses</i>

12:45.849 --> 12:47.768
- Yeah, get it being.
- Obtain that.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.522
<i>And here's a new thought</i>

12:51.522 --> 12:53.899
<i>Uh, that I... bought</i>

12:54.900 --> 12:57.402
<i>At the store</i>

12:58.362 --> 13:00.447
- Next time you'll get 'em.
- First part was good.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.616
- Dope first verse.
- You gave it your all.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.117
That's what matters.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.917
I figured it out. I know what I wanna do.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.044
I wanna rhyme words freely.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.214
- Rhyme words freely? How do you mean?
- What?

13:17.881 --> 13:20.551
<i>I'll say words and then words
That rhyme with those words</i>

13:20.551 --> 13:23.804
<i>It's like a-a puzzle
With ten million code words</i>

13:23.804 --> 13:27.057
<i>I tried to do other stuff
It all went poorly</i>

13:27.057 --> 13:29.476
<i>It felt like there's nothing out there
For me</i>

13:29.476 --> 13:32.813
<i>I think I found a light
I can rhyme words all night</i>

13:32.813 --> 13:35.190
<i>It's, like, the only thing
That feels right</i>

13:35.691 --> 13:37.651
Is this like spoken word?

13:38.277 --> 13:39.486
- Greets.
- Greets.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.779
Greets.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.865
You're the talented being from the park.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.116
- I am?
- They are?

13:44.116 --> 13:47.160
Yeah. They impressed a whole crowd
of beings in the park.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.787
That's kind of you to say.

13:48.787 --> 13:51.665
I was worried I wouldn't be able
to find something I was good at.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.292
I did mess up at the end, though.

13:53.292 --> 13:56.044
We'll continue
this confusing conversation shortly.

13:59.131 --> 14:00.549
What can we do for you both?

14:00.549 --> 14:04.511
My friend here is very excited
about getting their first ink stain.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.598
I only humored them because I wanted
to spend more time with them.

14:07.598 --> 14:11.226
This excuse is not uncommon and produces
a good amount of new customers.

14:11.226 --> 14:15.105
Yes. Maybe we can ink
a beautiful scene on your lower back.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.149
It is all the rage right now.

14:17.149 --> 14:22.279
I am overwhelmed
by the feeling of possibility.

14:22.279 --> 14:25.115
Would you mind saying that
so my offspring can hear?

14:25.115 --> 14:28.118
I am overwhelmed
by the feeling of possibility.

14:28.118 --> 14:31.705
Me too!
I'm excited to explore this new ability.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.165
I think that backfired.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.709
I'm sorry.
You don't really need to get an ink stain.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.962
I thought it would be fun to come here
because you seemed genuinely curious.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.006
I never intended
to cause you more anxiety.

14:42.341 --> 14:45.928
It's okay, I want one.
I wanna commemorate our time together.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.638
This is going to sound strange,

14:47.638 --> 14:51.391
but would you be able to ink stain
a pink vibrating creature

14:51.391 --> 14:52.726
with a soap leaf in its mouth?

14:55.229 --> 14:57.898
We've had
a lot stranger asks than that, my friend.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.608
The pink vibrating creature represents

14:59.608 --> 15:02.319
the time I wasted feeling anxious
about what could be,

15:02.819 --> 15:05.697
rather than focusing on what already is.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.282
Why the soap leaf?

15:07.282 --> 15:09.034
I don't know. I guess it reminds me,

15:09.034 --> 15:11.370
you can't help that some things
in life are just gross.

15:11.370 --> 15:13.622
But even all gross things are temporary.

15:13.622 --> 15:16.291
Gratitude for giving me
a fresh perspective.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.047
This is incredibly painful.

15:22.047 --> 15:26.718
Don't worry. The pain is also temporary,
unlike my employment here.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.762
I know this is none of my commerce,

15:28.762 --> 15:33.058
but life is finite which is why you should
embrace a vocation that you enjoy.

15:33.058 --> 15:35.394
Listen to them. They are sma--

15:36.186 --> 15:39.439
Sorry.
I got lost in what they were saying.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.734
Can you help us understand
what it is you'd like to be doing?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.238
<i>I knew my lifegivers wouldn't get it</i>

15:46.238 --> 15:49.116
<i>I'm glad I said it
But I also, like, kinda regret it</i>

15:49.116 --> 15:51.743
<i>Ink staining is cool
But I don't wanna do it</i>

15:51.743 --> 15:55.038
<i>It's not, like, stupid
I'm just not really drawn to it</i>

15:55.038 --> 15:56.915
Oh, blip, that's pretty good.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.293
<i>What if I wanna dance to my own music?</i>

15:59.293 --> 16:01.837
<i>Not in real life
'Cause I'm bad at limbshaking</i>

16:01.837 --> 16:04.089
<i>Taking the safe route is a temptation</i>

16:04.089 --> 16:08.886
<i>But I feel-- I don't know, impatient
I'm feeling many strange sensations</i>

16:09.845 --> 16:10.721
Wow.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.390
I have to say,

16:13.390 --> 16:16.643
I did not see the day going this way
when I woke up this morning.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.187
I have been pleasantly surprised.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.479
Me too.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.483
Do you have any more establishments
to pursue?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.236
No.
I have to go feed my vibrating creature

16:26.236 --> 16:28.906
before they punish me
with their mean glances.

16:29.573 --> 16:32.826
Would it be appropriate if I walked
with you in that direction?

16:33.410 --> 16:34.411
Of course.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.083
We need to give them wings to fly.

16:40.083 --> 16:44.087
They found something that they like.
Let's let them wing it.

16:44.087 --> 16:47.591
You're right.
But who will carry on our traditions?

16:47.591 --> 16:49.259
Nothing is forever.

16:49.259 --> 16:52.012
Perhaps they will eventually come back
to the ink salon,

16:52.012 --> 16:55.182
or perhaps they will continue
their own journey,

16:55.182 --> 16:57.851
and the ink salon will be no longer.
We don't know.

16:57.851 --> 17:01.230
But they're a good being,
and they deserve our support.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.356
I know.

17:02.356 --> 17:04.358
You are a good lifegiver.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.276
You are a good lifegiver too.

17:06.777 --> 17:09.655
Your passion inspires others
to find their own.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.952
I had a really nice time spending the day
with you today.

17:14.952 --> 17:15.868
I did too.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.704
Would you maybe wanna
go out again sometime?

17:19.665 --> 17:23.085
Perhaps on a proper date
to the planetarium on Double Shadow Day?

17:24.336 --> 17:25.712
I would like that very much.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.257
What?

17:28.257 --> 17:29.675
I knew my wish would come true.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.178
See you tomorrow.

17:34.429 --> 17:35.764
- Careful, fresh ink.
- Sorry.

17:38.183 --> 17:41.895
You know, I waited all day for you
to officially ask me out.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.524
I never thought you'd get an ink stain
before you finally did it.

17:45.524 --> 17:47.609
It was worth the pain.

17:54.408 --> 17:56.535
Offspring, can I talk to you for a moment?

17:58.120 --> 17:59.538
It'll just take a moment.

18:00.706 --> 18:02.708
I wanna show you something.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.461
Did you just do that?

18:06.461 --> 18:07.963
Yeah. I did.

18:09.214 --> 18:13.802
Offspring, I'm someone who believes
in telling stories through art.

18:13.802 --> 18:17.598
And I want you to share your story
with all beings out there.

18:18.140 --> 18:21.810
If speaking in words that have a similar
cadence and rhythm and sound-like endings

18:21.810 --> 18:25.397
is how you wanna do that,
then that's what you should do.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.524
What about working here
at the ink stain salon?

18:27.524 --> 18:29.610
You can always come back here if you want.

18:30.694 --> 18:31.820
I don't think I will.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.113
But you can if you want.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.740
I really don't think I'm going to.

18:34.740 --> 18:38.118
Let's just leave it at
"The door will always be open."

18:39.745 --> 18:40.746
Thank you, Lifegiver.

18:41.455 --> 18:45.167
You know, in all my revolutions
helping beings share their stories,

18:45.167 --> 18:47.169
I realized a very important lesson.

18:47.169 --> 18:50.547
I know, "Keep your ink stain out of direct
starlight and clean it twice a day."

18:51.632 --> 18:53.342
You've listened.

18:53.342 --> 18:56.470
You say it to every customer,
like, 20 times.

18:57.596 --> 18:58.430
I do.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.308
But that's not
the lesson I'm talking about.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.977
In helping beings share their stories,

19:03.977 --> 19:07.981
I realized that the most important story
is the one you tell yourself.

19:07.981 --> 19:13.487
And I want your story to be
that you can do or be anything you want.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.244
Hey, will you sit with me
while I finish this ink stain?

19:20.244 --> 19:23.580
Actually, Lifegiver,
maybe I can finish it for you?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.291
Only if you want to.

19:27.501 --> 19:28.502
Okay.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.296
That does not feel good!

19:34.341 --> 19:36.343
It's perfect.

19:39.096 --> 19:40.222
See?

19:40.222 --> 19:42.766
Aren't you glad I won't be doing
this professionally?
