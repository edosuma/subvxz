00:00.206 --> 00:01.666
Previously on "Recovery Road"...

00:01.700 --> 00:03.301
- I have a fiancÃ©.
- I know you do.

00:03.335 --> 00:05.186
You're incredible.

00:05.221 --> 00:08.172
I can't seem to get her to
make the right choices.

00:08.207 --> 00:10.124
Do you know what Al-Anon is?

00:10.159 --> 00:12.210
- Newcomer? I'm Alan.
- I'm Charlotte.

00:12.212 --> 00:14.178
It's my first meeting.

00:14.213 --> 00:15.346
- What is that?
- A Xanax.

00:15.348 --> 00:18.149
If you need this to
pull yourself together,

00:18.200 --> 00:19.284
I won't say a word.

00:19.318 --> 00:20.618
I was just in the bathroom with Trish.

00:20.653 --> 00:22.620
You know that tattoo of
her daughter's name?

00:22.622 --> 00:25.139
She showed it to me,
and there's no tattoo.

00:25.174 --> 00:27.559
Is it the same gun? I'll deal with it.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.245
It Diesel's idea. He told
Asa to plant the gun on you.

00:30.279 --> 00:33.164
Diesel's crazy. There's nothing
that your brother could have done.

00:33.215 --> 00:35.183
There's a whole lot he could have done,

00:35.217 --> 00:36.601
like not frame his brother.

00:36.635 --> 00:38.603
It's called Suboxone. It's
used to treat addiction.

00:38.605 --> 00:41.539
They were really helping me stay sober.

00:41.574 --> 00:44.509
We always supported all our children
in all their endeavors.

00:44.543 --> 00:47.178
Except when it came to
your other daughter Rebecca,

00:47.229 --> 00:48.563
who you turned your back on.

00:48.614 --> 00:50.481
Maddie: Every person in Rebecca's life

00:50.483 --> 00:52.166
turned their back on her, even me.

00:52.201 --> 00:54.569
You don't deserve Rebecca.

00:57.473 --> 00:58.553
A more clinical environment

00:58.557 --> 01:00.391
might work for some individuals, but...

01:00.442 --> 01:01.559
Maddie: Taking the first step,

01:01.561 --> 01:03.411
giving up control...

01:03.445 --> 01:05.446
(chattering)

01:05.497 --> 01:07.415
that leap into the unknown

01:07.449 --> 01:09.467
is filled with such trepidation.

01:10.519 --> 01:12.337
Until...

01:12.371 --> 01:14.405
(chattering continues)

01:14.440 --> 01:16.407
you see the opportunity.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.401 --> 01:26.367
It sounds wonderful.

01:26.402 --> 01:28.369
You always have liked spas.

01:28.404 --> 01:32.124
Woman: I really don't want
you to get the wrong impression.

01:32.424 --> 01:34.392
We take our group care very seriously.

01:34.394 --> 01:36.327
(chattering)

01:41.250 --> 01:43.267
Woman: how rigorous in
structure our days are,

01:43.302 --> 01:45.303
and I'm happy to answer any
questions you might have.

01:45.354 --> 01:47.271
What does the intake process entail?

01:47.323 --> 01:50.224
Standard. Rebecca would
meet with a medical doctor,

01:50.259 --> 01:52.260
we'd search her belongings in person.

01:52.294 --> 01:53.645
She'd get settled in her room

01:53.679 --> 01:56.197
and then we'd have her
meet with her primary therapist.

01:56.231 --> 01:58.149
That all sounds fine.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.534
What do you think, dear?

01:59.568 --> 02:02.120
I think this place seems perfect.

02:06.141 --> 02:08.621
She sent you, like, six
different date looks.

02:11.497 --> 02:14.465
And now it's eight.

02:14.516 --> 02:15.550
This one's kind of fun, though.

02:15.601 --> 02:17.468
Yeah, I'd wear that.

02:17.519 --> 02:19.570
You want to borrow clothes from my mom?

02:19.605 --> 02:21.489
I don't think we can be friends anymore.

02:21.540 --> 02:23.574
You're such a bitch.

02:23.625 --> 02:27.478
I never really saw your
mom as the neurotic type.

02:27.513 --> 02:29.347
She's not.

02:29.398 --> 02:31.516
I blame Alan Al-Anon.

02:31.550 --> 02:33.401
I take it they met at Al-Anon?

02:33.452 --> 02:35.453
When did you get so clever?

02:35.455 --> 02:36.554
Ha ha. Shut up.

02:37.589 --> 02:40.391
Wes, are you going to help
out with Trish's party?

02:40.442 --> 02:42.360
Can't. Sorry.

02:48.467 --> 02:51.486
Okay, is it just me or
is he acting super weird?

02:51.520 --> 02:53.488
Yep, for days.

02:53.539 --> 02:56.324
So, I think I know why.

03:00.396 --> 03:02.346
It's because of me.

03:02.398 --> 03:04.332
It's because of us... Wes and me.

03:04.366 --> 03:06.367
Our relationship, it's confusing,

03:06.418 --> 03:08.252
and I thought we were going
to talk about things,

03:08.287 --> 03:10.138
but we haven't.

03:12.141 --> 03:14.225
I thought everything was okay. It's not.

03:15.277 --> 03:17.278
Or it could have
something to do with Harper.

03:17.329 --> 03:18.579
- Harper?
- Yeah.

03:18.630 --> 03:20.298
Jasper said that
she stopped by the house

03:20.300 --> 03:23.101
and she and Wes
disappeared for four hours last week.

03:23.152 --> 03:26.120
Oh, wow. Okay.

03:26.155 --> 03:28.156
Do you think we should tell Craig?

03:28.207 --> 03:30.491
- We should probably tell...
- No, I think...

03:30.526 --> 03:32.176
Come on, people, we
need more decorations.

03:32.178 --> 03:34.512
And not sad Dollar Store decorations.

03:34.514 --> 03:37.448
Nice decorations. And
where's that turntable?

03:37.499 --> 03:39.117
Why is this banner crooked?

03:39.168 --> 03:40.608
Okay, okay, okay, and on to balloons.

03:40.619 --> 03:42.553
We need more of them. Lots more.

03:42.588 --> 03:45.189
But not too many, because
then they'll get cruise ship tacky.

03:45.224 --> 03:47.158
So more than 20, but less than 100.

03:47.192 --> 03:50.445
And no, I repeat, no green!

03:50.496 --> 03:53.631
Trish hates green. I think. Whatever.

03:55.451 --> 03:56.731
Just can't risk it.

03:59.571 --> 04:01.322
So, question...

04:01.373 --> 04:02.507
No, you cannot be relieved
of your party duties,

04:02.541 --> 04:04.425
and, yes, I'll probably
need you to go to the store.

04:04.460 --> 04:07.311
Okay, cool. I just
wanted to ask you about Wes.

04:07.362 --> 04:08.442
- Is everything okay?
- Yep.

04:08.447 --> 04:10.281
So we shouldn't be worried?

04:10.332 --> 04:11.365
Wes can be moody.

04:11.416 --> 04:13.334
A lot's been going on
lately, but he'll be okay.

04:13.385 --> 04:16.220
So, you'd let us
know if anything's wrong?

04:16.271 --> 04:17.438
Come on, guys, you know I can't...

04:17.473 --> 04:19.322
sponsor-sponsee privilege, you know?

04:19.358 --> 04:21.325
It's just that we know Harper was here.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.177
Wait, what?

04:24.263 --> 04:26.063
- He's in the basement.
- Thanks.

04:27.432 --> 04:29.317
Really?

04:30.402 --> 04:32.203
A gun?

04:32.254 --> 04:34.338
You buried a gun? A
gun that killed someone?

04:34.373 --> 04:36.174
What the hell is wrong with you?

04:36.225 --> 04:37.225
I don't know. Harper said we should

04:37.259 --> 04:38.309
and I didn't know what else to do.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.228
Go to the police and turn
it in, that's what you do.

04:40.279 --> 04:42.163
I can't do that to my
brother, I just can't.

04:42.214 --> 04:43.581
There's loyalty and there's stupidity.

04:43.632 --> 04:45.199
He's trying to frame you.

04:45.234 --> 04:46.267
You have to go to the police!

04:46.301 --> 04:48.219
You don't do that to
family. It's not right.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.154
I need to talk to
him before I do anything.

04:50.189 --> 04:51.572
That is the last
thing that you need to do.

04:51.607 --> 04:53.541
It's what I'm doing. I
need to hear it from him.

04:53.575 --> 04:55.176
Are you doubting
Harper's telling you the truth?

04:55.210 --> 04:56.594
No, she only lies when she's using

04:56.628 --> 04:58.563
and right now she's clean.

04:58.597 --> 05:00.565
Harper's got my back.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.483
I just need to talk to Asa.

05:02.534 --> 05:04.085
I'm going with you.

05:04.119 --> 05:05.086
No, you're not.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.470
Who knows what you'll be walking into?

05:06.505 --> 05:08.139
Look, it'll be worse if you come.

05:08.173 --> 05:11.133
It'll freak him out, and this
is something I need to do alone.

05:17.449 --> 05:18.583
Wes.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.487
- We have to go after him.
- What? No way.

05:23.522 --> 05:25.442
We have to, he's
probably going to go see Harper,

05:25.490 --> 05:27.358
and bad things always
happen when she's involved.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.480
Just trust me, we have to go.

05:28.493 --> 05:29.544
What are we going to tell Vern?

05:29.578 --> 05:31.462
He already said he might need
me to go to the store.

05:31.513 --> 05:33.397
- It'll be fine.
- Look, I'm worried, too,

05:33.432 --> 05:34.599
- but following Wes is crazy.
- Whatever.

05:34.624 --> 05:35.533
I'm going with or without you.

05:35.567 --> 05:37.535
If you're not, that's cool...

05:37.569 --> 05:39.487
All right, all right. I'll drive.

05:41.373 --> 05:42.490

Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.Addic7ed.com -

05:51.416 --> 05:54.302
Oh, Vern. How's the party stuff?

05:54.336 --> 05:56.420
Fine. Great. Not why I'm here.

05:56.422 --> 05:59.423
- Okay.
- I just got some information,

05:59.425 --> 06:03.145
and I think someone has been in the
house who shouldn't have been.

06:04.396 --> 06:06.264
Asa. Was it Asa?

06:06.266 --> 06:07.431
I told Wes in no uncertain terms...

06:07.482 --> 06:09.483
- It's someone else.
- Who?

06:09.518 --> 06:13.271
It doesn't matter. I just need
you to do a house search today.

06:14.406 --> 06:17.275
- Why?
- Just do it.

06:17.326 --> 06:20.278
- Please?
- You really can't elaborate?

06:20.329 --> 06:22.363
I told you all the info you need.

06:22.414 --> 06:24.498
Right. Got it. Okay.

06:24.533 --> 06:28.419
Well, I'm off to get Trish in a few,

06:28.453 --> 06:31.422
but I can call Donna Marie to
come in and do the search.

06:31.456 --> 06:33.341
Great. Thanks.

06:36.428 --> 06:38.296
Joan Didion. Great writer.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.464
Oh, yeah. Yeah, just started.

06:40.515 --> 06:42.350
I'm liking it so far.

06:42.384 --> 06:44.302
Yeah, she's good.

06:44.353 --> 06:46.304
Cynthia got me into
her work. She loves her.

06:46.355 --> 06:48.439
Really? Oh.

06:48.473 --> 06:50.441
That's, uh... I...

06:50.475 --> 06:53.361
I had absolutely no idea.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.480
If it were up to me,

06:56.531 --> 06:59.367
there's no way jerked chicken lasagna,

06:59.401 --> 07:02.286
matzo ball soup, and
a green bean casserole

07:02.321 --> 07:04.322
would make it onto the same table.

07:04.373 --> 07:08.326
But, God, have I missed that girl.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.461
I'll make anything she
wants for dinner tonight.

07:10.495 --> 07:11.956
But only tonight.

07:11.981 --> 07:13.464
From what I heard, she missed you, too.

07:13.498 --> 07:16.300
Oh, really? Who told you that?

07:16.335 --> 07:18.502
- Craig told me.
- Craig?

07:18.504 --> 07:21.505
Would have been nice
if he'd told me that.

07:21.507 --> 07:24.308
(doorbell rings)

07:26.345 --> 07:27.511
Oh. Can I help you?

07:27.513 --> 07:29.480
I hope so. I'm looking for my fiancÃ©e.

07:29.514 --> 07:31.482
She's, uh... there she is.

07:31.516 --> 07:33.401
Paul.

07:35.437 --> 07:36.404
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:36.438 --> 07:40.274
Wow, what a surprise.

07:40.325 --> 07:42.405
- Hey, man. How are you?
- Hey, good to see you.

07:42.411 --> 07:44.528
- Yeah, see you.
- See you, too.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.530
Let me introduce you to...

07:46.532 --> 07:50.368
Craig. I'm Craig. Lovely
to meet you. Really. Pleasure.

07:50.419 --> 07:51.535
Hi.

07:53.372 --> 07:55.456
- Wow, you're here.
- Yeah.

07:55.507 --> 07:57.458
Great. Why are you...

07:57.509 --> 08:00.344
You left your phone on the kitchen
counter this morning.

08:00.379 --> 08:02.379
I just thought I'd swing
by and drop it off for you.

08:02.381 --> 08:04.382
Oh, awesome. Thank you.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.267
Sure.

08:06.301 --> 08:07.385
I guess I'll see you later?

08:07.387 --> 08:09.303
Do you need any help with the party?

08:09.354 --> 08:10.675
I thought you were
hanging out with Mike today.

08:10.700 --> 08:11.413
Not for a couple hours.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.391
I figured it might be
fun to come by, help out,

08:13.442 --> 08:15.393
get to know
everybody a little bit better

08:15.395 --> 08:17.395
since you're spending so
much time here lately.

08:17.446 --> 08:20.364
- I blame this guy for that.
- Ah, my bad.

08:20.399 --> 08:22.395
Not cool. Shouldn't have monopolized

08:22.396 --> 08:23.367
your fiancÃ©e's time like that.

08:23.402 --> 08:26.404
Speaking of time, look at the time.

08:26.406 --> 08:29.323
I'm sorry I can't stay and chat,
but I should get going.

08:29.374 --> 08:31.292
It's a long drive to pick up Trish.

08:31.326 --> 08:32.493
So, very nice meeting you

08:32.544 --> 08:34.544
and perhaps I'll see
you when I get back.

08:36.381 --> 08:38.299
You going to put me to work, boss?

08:38.350 --> 08:40.351
Yeah. (chuckles)

08:57.269 --> 08:59.170
It's so weird.

08:59.221 --> 09:01.188
What? No, no.

09:01.223 --> 09:03.303
Following your friend
isn't weird at all, it's normal.

09:03.308 --> 09:05.159
It's super, super normal.

09:05.193 --> 09:07.244
I really thought he
was going to Harper's.

09:10.215 --> 09:12.266
It's Diesel.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.260
- We have to get over there.
- No, Maddie. No, no.

09:14.269 --> 09:16.237
We can't. Maddie, we can't.

09:16.271 --> 09:18.058
What is Wes going to do
if we just bust in there?

09:18.083 --> 09:19.123
You're right, you're right.

09:19.157 --> 09:20.241
Okay, okay. You're right, you're right.

09:20.292 --> 09:22.209
It's just that that guy,

09:22.244 --> 09:24.545
he knows Asa and he's a drug dealer

09:24.596 --> 09:27.515
and I think Wes might be
here because he's a customer.

09:45.312 --> 09:48.197
No, thanks. I'm sober.

09:48.232 --> 09:50.283
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.337
Satisfied?

09:58.308 --> 10:00.142
So, what's up?

10:02.145 --> 10:04.197
Asa hasn't been returning my calls.

10:04.231 --> 10:06.332
- You know where he is?
- Am I your brother's keeper?

10:06.383 --> 10:09.252
You know what? Cut the crap.

10:09.254 --> 10:13.222
- I know.
- About?

10:13.224 --> 10:14.307
The pharmacy.

10:21.365 --> 10:23.299
I don't think he's here to buy drugs.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.301
Right, yeah,

10:25.303 --> 10:29.222
because usually when
people go to a drug dealer's house

10:29.273 --> 10:32.275
they're coming for a couple of laughs,

10:32.309 --> 10:34.243
stimulating conversation.

10:34.294 --> 10:37.096
- He's not using.
- You know that for a fact?

10:37.130 --> 10:38.264
No, but I'm pretty sure.

10:38.298 --> 10:40.233
I'm almost positive.

10:40.267 --> 10:43.052
He's in a really good place
with his sobriety right now.

10:44.271 --> 10:46.105
Really?

10:47.241 --> 10:50.126
- That's good to hear.
- Yeah.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.128
We check in with each other a lot.

10:52.179 --> 10:54.964
He really gets what I've been through.

10:55.015 --> 10:57.133
We both had so many false
starts, you know?

11:03.156 --> 11:05.942
Do you have
anything to say for yourself?

11:05.976 --> 11:07.126
I hope you get a refund?

11:07.160 --> 11:10.146
Sorry, Dad, sorry. That's a joke.

11:10.180 --> 11:12.982
I couldn't look
anyone in the eye in there.

11:13.016 --> 11:14.150
I don't know what's happened to you.

11:14.184 --> 11:17.937
When did you become so... so...

11:17.988 --> 11:21.040
I am utterly at a
loss. This is her third time.

11:21.074 --> 11:22.603
This is your third time getting kicked

11:22.628 --> 11:24.093
out of rehab for smuggling drugs in.

11:24.127 --> 11:27.013
Do you have any idea what it
costs to go to one of these places?

11:27.064 --> 11:29.899
Less than Penelope's med school.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.068
I'll spend every last
penny I have on Penelope

11:32.070 --> 11:34.070
because Penelope has a bright future.

11:35.372 --> 11:37.006
What do you have?

11:37.040 --> 11:41.043
What is the best that I
can expect from you, Rebecca?

11:41.078 --> 11:43.362
That you'll stay clean
for longer than a month?

11:43.397 --> 11:47.950
That you won't call me at all
hours of the night asking for money?

11:48.001 --> 11:49.321
That you won't disgrace our family

11:49.336 --> 11:50.953
more than you already have?

11:53.974 --> 11:55.941
I'm sorry.

11:58.328 --> 12:00.279
I found a place for you.

12:01.365 --> 12:03.199
It's a sober living facility.

12:03.201 --> 12:05.835
After detox, they'll admit you.

12:05.886 --> 12:07.219
And sorry doesn't cut it anymore.

12:07.270 --> 12:10.272
This is the last time I'm doing this.

12:13.327 --> 12:15.161
Diesel: What about the pharmacy?

12:16.380 --> 12:18.247
I know you took a guy out.

12:20.300 --> 12:23.102
That night Asa went to
the pharmacy with me?

12:23.136 --> 12:26.155
- Yeah.
- That didn't happen.

12:29.326 --> 12:32.211
So, this is how you're
going to play it. Cool.

12:32.262 --> 12:34.742
Nothing happened at the pharmacy.

12:36.133 --> 12:38.453
I got a guy that I
work with there sometimes.

12:39.269 --> 12:41.153
Hooks me up with pills,

12:41.188 --> 12:43.068
I give him a quarter of the profit.

12:44.274 --> 12:46.292
Asa went with me that night.

12:46.326 --> 12:50.129
Picked up the scrips, exchanged
a few pleasantries.

12:50.180 --> 12:52.231
I slipped my man his
cut and that was it.

12:55.152 --> 12:58.070
- Really? That's it?
- Yep.

12:58.105 --> 13:00.089
I guess it's my word against
your brother's.

13:00.123 --> 13:02.041
Kind of a toss-up, huh?

13:02.092 --> 13:03.125
Not really, man.

13:05.095 --> 13:07.980
I get it. He's your brother.

13:08.014 --> 13:09.315
You trust him.

13:09.366 --> 13:12.918
But me? I don't trust a damn
word that comes out of his mouth.

13:12.953 --> 13:15.037
The kid just says whatever the hell
he has to to save his own ass.

13:15.039 --> 13:16.956
- That's not true.
- Come on.

13:17.007 --> 13:20.943
- West Covina?
- He was tweaking.

13:20.977 --> 13:23.145
You ever rat him out when you were high?

13:23.147 --> 13:26.999
- No.
- Me, neither.

13:27.033 --> 13:29.513
We're both better to him
than he's ever been to us.

13:32.139 --> 13:34.890
So, that night at the pharmacy

13:34.925 --> 13:36.058
it was just you and Asa?

13:39.996 --> 13:41.947
Harper was there, too.

13:41.998 --> 13:45.000
She stayed in the car. I
asked her not to come in.

13:45.002 --> 13:47.002
Your brother and her, they annoy me.

13:47.053 --> 13:50.773
They're always all
over each other. It's gross.

13:51.007 --> 13:53.325
They're together?

13:53.360 --> 13:55.840
Yeah, they have been for a while now.

13:57.030 --> 13:59.510
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

14:02.886 --> 14:05.221
I knew you didn't. I knew
Asa wouldn't tell you.

14:05.255 --> 14:07.857
I just wanted to see the look
on your face when you found out.

14:07.908 --> 14:10.209
- I don't believe you.
- Whatever.

14:10.243 --> 14:12.723
Don't ask questions if
you don't want answers.

14:14.214 --> 14:15.881
Harper's your brother's little slut now.

14:15.932 --> 14:17.652
- That bitch is so...
- Shut up!

14:20.270 --> 14:23.239
Or what? You're going to punch me?

14:23.273 --> 14:26.175
Come on. Do it.

14:26.209 --> 14:27.249
I dare you.

14:33.266 --> 14:35.351
You know what? If you hear from Asa,

14:35.353 --> 14:37.319
have him call me.

15:04.948 --> 15:06.208
Is that you don't
believe in global warming.

15:06.242 --> 15:08.009
No, it's not that I don't believe it,

15:08.060 --> 15:11.146
I just think you guys are blowing
it way out of proportion as usual.

15:11.180 --> 15:12.998
I come bearing cupcakes.

15:13.032 --> 15:14.115
Salted caramel.

15:14.117 --> 15:16.001
They might have entirely too much salt.

15:16.035 --> 15:18.119
I don't know. First time
I've ever tried making them.

15:18.154 --> 15:21.022
Why are you doing this to me?

15:21.057 --> 15:23.024
What? What am I doing? What did I do?

15:24.143 --> 15:26.111
Relax, I'm joking. You're just...

15:26.145 --> 15:28.063
you're tempting me to cheat on my diet.

15:28.114 --> 15:32.033
Oh, right. You're still paleo.

15:32.035 --> 15:34.052
- Good one.
- Are you okay?

15:34.086 --> 15:37.138
Yeah, I'm fine. I just always get
a little stressed before a party.

15:39.158 --> 15:41.960
Oh, man. That is so worth the cheat.

15:41.994 --> 15:44.079
- I'm so glad.
- Me, too,

15:44.130 --> 15:47.048
because when it comes to cheating,
it's not always worth it.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.884
Throwing everything away, you know?

15:49.936 --> 15:52.354
- Dude, it's one cupcake.
- Slippery slope.

15:52.356 --> 15:54.356
One cupcake leads to another cupcake.

15:54.407 --> 15:56.942
The next thing you know,
you're wolfing down entire pizzas

15:56.993 --> 15:58.360
and hiding it from your
friends and your family,

15:58.411 --> 16:00.829
cheating right under their noses.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.932
You know they won't
approve, but you just can't stop

16:03.966 --> 16:05.640
because that all-you-can-eat Chinese

16:05.665 --> 16:07.293
buffet is just too hard to resist.

16:07.320 --> 16:09.321
And then someone puts it all together

16:09.372 --> 16:11.906
and they see how you
stare at that moo shu chicken.

16:11.908 --> 16:14.292
Then what do you do?

16:14.343 --> 16:15.927
How do you explain yourself?

16:17.313 --> 16:18.847
Sorry.

16:18.898 --> 16:21.018
I have a very
complicated relationship with food.

16:27.256 --> 16:29.874
I'm bummed I can't stay, but
Mike's only in town for the night.

16:29.925 --> 16:31.926
No, that's fine. I totally get it.

16:31.961 --> 16:35.196
Call me if you want to
meet us later, okay?

16:35.231 --> 16:36.231
Okay, will do.

16:36.233 --> 16:38.283
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

16:40.369 --> 16:42.203
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:43.906 --> 16:45.190
Come on.

16:49.228 --> 16:52.230
Craig? The other guy you
were telling me about was Craig?

16:52.281 --> 16:54.282
How could you do this? This is not okay!

16:54.333 --> 16:56.117
You didn't seem so opposed to it

16:56.119 --> 16:57.159
before you knew it was him.

16:57.169 --> 16:58.253
Some random guy that you kissed one time

16:58.287 --> 17:00.221
is not the same as you having an affair

17:00.256 --> 17:03.058
with my counselor, my friend!

17:03.092 --> 17:04.142
There's so many other people involved.

17:04.193 --> 17:06.111
Do you have any idea what
this means for him,

17:06.145 --> 17:08.163
or for me or Maddie...
the other people in this house?

17:08.196 --> 17:11.082
It's not like I
intended for this to happen,

17:11.117 --> 17:13.251
to make things weird and complicated.

17:13.301 --> 17:14.571
- I didn't...
- Craig does not

17:14.597 --> 17:16.054
deserve to be treated like this.

17:16.088 --> 17:18.138
I'm really not toying with him.

17:18.190 --> 17:20.157
- I'm confused!
- Don't care.

17:20.192 --> 17:22.993
I really don't care.

17:23.029 --> 17:25.079
I'm just so disappointed.

17:25.082 --> 17:26.214
I have so much on my plate right now,

17:26.248 --> 17:28.083
and I just really
wish that I didn't have...

17:28.085 --> 17:30.051
How could you do this?

17:31.103 --> 17:33.004
You of all people should know.

17:33.039 --> 17:34.105
What's that supposed to mean?

17:34.156 --> 17:36.074
You're going to pretend like
you've never hooked up

17:36.108 --> 17:37.992
with guys who were in relationships?

17:37.994 --> 17:39.994
Please, it's not even the same thing.

17:39.996 --> 17:41.930
You had a full-blown affair with your

17:41.955 --> 17:43.965
brother's best friend who was married.

17:43.967 --> 17:46.017
How is that not the same thing?

17:46.068 --> 17:48.937
I made a lot of
mistakes when I was coked up.

17:48.939 --> 17:51.356
I did a lot of things
that I am not proud of.

17:51.407 --> 17:55.043
But you? You are in your right mind.

17:55.045 --> 17:57.011
You have no excuse.

18:03.869 --> 18:06.821
And then, uh...

18:06.872 --> 18:08.840
then it started getting worse.

18:09.959 --> 18:12.877
She was coming home later and later,

18:12.928 --> 18:15.897
She would always call,
always had some excuse,

18:15.948 --> 18:19.901
but it was harder and
harder to buy into it.

18:21.287 --> 18:23.872
I couldn't talk to her about it.

18:23.906 --> 18:26.291
Well, I didn't know how to.

18:28.277 --> 18:30.278
And then...

18:30.312 --> 18:33.314
then this one night,

18:33.365 --> 18:37.252
she didn't come home at all.

18:37.303 --> 18:39.254
She didn't call,

18:39.305 --> 18:42.307
snuck in right before her
alarm went off, and...

18:44.393 --> 18:46.861
I have never been so scared.

18:48.364 --> 18:51.199
And I couldn't not do something, so...

18:52.368 --> 18:56.137
I had them do a
locker search at her school.

18:57.356 --> 19:00.108
She thinks it was random.
She doesn't know it was me.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.162
I almost told her the other day, but...

19:06.248 --> 19:08.216
we're doing so well right now.

19:10.085 --> 19:11.252
She's doing so well.

19:13.155 --> 19:15.023
And, um...

19:17.042 --> 19:18.159
Well, I...

19:20.079 --> 19:22.046
I don't want to mess that up.

19:23.265 --> 19:25.049
Not when...

19:26.302 --> 19:30.188
not when I'm starting to
feel like I have my daughter back.

19:33.159 --> 19:36.010
Thank you for listening.

19:45.187 --> 19:47.071
How things go with your brother?

19:47.106 --> 19:49.073
You guys talk things through?

19:49.124 --> 19:51.042
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

19:51.076 --> 19:53.127
So, you got answers. Everything's fine.

19:53.129 --> 19:56.014
Yeah, it really is. Thanks, man.

19:56.065 --> 19:58.049
Oh, thank God.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.951
Wes, I'm really proud of you,

19:59.985 --> 20:01.920
confronting that
difficult situation head-on

20:01.954 --> 20:03.037
and really resolving it.

20:03.039 --> 20:05.039
Uh-huh. Thanks.

20:05.041 --> 20:07.926
- What took you guys so long?
- We forgot the ice.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.127
Yeah, and we hit really heavy traffic.

20:09.178 --> 20:11.930
We had to go back to the
store to get Trish her Gummi Worms,

20:11.981 --> 20:13.414
because you know how
much she loves them.

20:13.449 --> 20:14.870
Oh, my God, yes. That totally makes

20:14.871 --> 20:17.193
up for your long, long absence.

20:18.954 --> 20:21.055
You want to tell me why you followed me?

20:24.376 --> 20:26.945
We were worried. We have been.

20:26.979 --> 20:27.979
We saw you rush out and we thought...

20:28.030 --> 20:30.365
Thought it would be a
good idea to follow me.

20:30.367 --> 20:32.367
- That is so screwed up.
- Okay, whatever.

20:32.418 --> 20:34.002
What other choice did we have?

20:34.004 --> 20:35.336
It's not like you've been talking to us

20:35.338 --> 20:37.305
or letting us in on what's
going on with you or talking to us.

20:37.356 --> 20:40.358
We had to find out from
Jasper that Harper was here.

20:40.392 --> 20:41.614
What the hell was she doing here?

20:41.639 --> 20:42.327
Places, everyone!

20:42.361 --> 20:45.280
They're here! Okay, lot
of energy, lot of enthusiasm.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.332
Big, big smiles!

20:47.383 --> 20:49.417
I'll tell you later. I just
can't tell you now, okay?

20:49.419 --> 20:51.386
- Why not?
- Because it's complicated

20:51.388 --> 20:53.271
- and I can't even begin to...
- Forget it.

20:53.305 --> 20:55.189
It's fine. It's totally fine.

20:55.241 --> 20:57.358
I guess I thought we were
close and we told each other stuff.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.878
But obviously I was mistaken
and it's fine.

20:59.912 --> 21:02.263
- Okay, fine. Fine.
- Fine.

21:02.298 --> 21:04.299
Surprise!

21:07.186 --> 21:09.187
Does Donna Marie get
excited about anything?

21:09.238 --> 21:11.718
Never even seen her smile.

21:13.242 --> 21:15.293
Will you please let me explain my side

21:15.327 --> 21:17.295
before judging me and condemning me?

21:17.329 --> 21:20.265
No, because nothing you
say is going to change my mind.

21:20.299 --> 21:22.267
What you're doing,
what you did... wrong.

21:22.301 --> 21:24.185
Oh, come on. Get off your high horse.

21:24.219 --> 21:26.321
It's not that simple,
and as my best friend...

21:26.372 --> 21:30.124
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

21:39.234 --> 21:41.119
Wonderful surprise, everyone.

21:41.153 --> 21:43.037
Really. Well done.

21:44.123 --> 21:46.207
Okay, unfortunately for us,

21:46.258 --> 21:49.093
Trish has decided to leave the house.

21:57.745 --> 22:00.647
- So, this is definite?
- Yep. Seems to be.

22:00.681 --> 22:02.599
Couldn't talk her out of it in the car.

22:02.601 --> 22:04.734
She said her priorities have changed

22:04.769 --> 22:06.703
and she needs to move
forward with her life.

22:06.705 --> 22:09.589
So, she knows she doesn't have a child.

22:09.624 --> 22:11.675
On an intellectual level, yes,

22:11.726 --> 22:15.562
but she has to keep reminding
herself on an emotional level.

22:15.613 --> 22:16.780
How does she do that?

22:16.814 --> 22:20.567
Trish has learned
some strategies in therapy

22:20.618 --> 22:22.669
to help manage the illusion.

22:22.703 --> 22:25.672
She'll snap a rubber band on
her wrist, among other things.

22:25.723 --> 22:29.693
The anti-psychotic medication
has also been quite effective.

22:29.727 --> 22:32.646
Her long term prognosis could be good.

22:32.697 --> 22:34.698
- And short term?
- That's hard to say.

22:34.749 --> 22:36.656
Methamphetamine psychosis, which is

22:36.681 --> 22:38.668
what she's currently suffering from,

22:38.670 --> 22:41.021
can last up to a year
or more in some cases.

22:41.055 --> 22:43.606
There may also be an
underlying mental health condition

22:43.641 --> 22:46.943
that's a contributing
factor, but at this point

22:46.994 --> 22:48.595
that's impossible to determine.

22:48.629 --> 22:50.664
The thought of her leaving... I can't...

22:50.715 --> 22:53.917
We really think she's going to
take her meds and go to therapy?

22:53.968 --> 22:56.052
No way! The minute she
walks out that door

22:56.103 --> 22:57.971
she's going to go and get high.

22:58.022 --> 23:00.523
- This sucks.
- Trish assured me

23:00.574 --> 23:01.958
the she has no plans to use.

23:01.992 --> 23:04.828
- She just can't be here.
- But she needs us.

23:04.879 --> 23:05.995
She can't leave, not now.

23:06.047 --> 23:08.882
She has to be here. You've
got to stop her.

23:08.933 --> 23:11.017
Wish I could. Really, I do.

23:11.068 --> 23:12.936
It just doesn't work that way.

23:12.938 --> 23:15.258
- Trish is here voluntarily.
- I'm going to go talk to her.

23:27.017 --> 23:28.902
Lovely to meet you both.

23:28.953 --> 23:30.904
Now, why don't we head to my office

23:30.955 --> 23:32.789
so we can have a chat and go over...

23:32.823 --> 23:35.992
- I can't stay.
- Oh, well, not a problem.

23:36.026 --> 23:37.894
I'm sure we'll see
you back her soon enough.

23:37.928 --> 23:39.929
Family day is next week, after all.

23:39.980 --> 23:42.899
If you could contact my wife regarding
that, I'd appreciate it.

23:42.901 --> 23:45.919
She'll be our family point
person from now on.

23:47.922 --> 23:49.706
Thank you.

23:54.695 --> 23:55.812
Good-bye, Rebecca.

23:55.863 --> 23:57.614
Bye, Dad.

24:04.805 --> 24:07.674
Right, let's, uh, get your things.

24:10.728 --> 24:14.697
Now that we are done with the paperwork,

24:14.732 --> 24:16.699
just a couple of house rules to go over.

24:16.701 --> 24:18.585
- Can't wait to here 'em.
- Right.

24:18.619 --> 24:22.689
You can only leave for scheduled group
activities for the first week.

24:22.723 --> 24:25.558
And after that, curfew
is strictly enforced.

24:25.609 --> 24:28.745
You'll be on kitchen clean-up
for the rest of this month,

24:28.779 --> 24:32.715
- and on Sunday...
- You realize how futile this is, right?

24:32.750 --> 24:36.719
- Pardon?
- The Twelve Steps? They don't work.

24:36.771 --> 24:41.608
Almost everyone relapses. I'm sure
you've seen the statistics.

24:41.659 --> 24:44.661
What you do? Total waste of time.

24:45.746 --> 24:48.681
Yeah.

24:48.716 --> 24:50.633
Wow, yeah. You might be right.

24:51.685 --> 24:54.020
But how I choose to potentially waste

24:54.071 --> 24:57.073
or not waste my time is
completely up to me.

24:57.075 --> 24:58.958
- Correct?
- I guess.

24:58.993 --> 25:01.544
Good. Glad we're in agreement.

25:01.546 --> 25:05.565
You're also aware of the
fact that you have choices, yes?

25:05.599 --> 25:07.901
- Yeah.
- Great.

25:07.935 --> 25:10.870
Perfect. So, here's the deal.

25:10.905 --> 25:14.908
You can choose to give up.

25:14.959 --> 25:17.594
You can think of
yourself as a statistic.

25:17.596 --> 25:19.012
You can plan your relapse now

25:19.063 --> 25:21.898
before we even get started, if you like.

25:21.900 --> 25:25.902
Or you can choose to see all of this

25:25.904 --> 25:28.872
as an opportunity.

25:28.906 --> 25:30.974
You can think of
yourself as somebody who'll never

25:31.008 --> 25:33.977
play by the rules of statistics again.

25:34.011 --> 25:37.847
You can plan your great future,

25:37.849 --> 25:39.966
not your sad relapse.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.921
It is entirely up to you.

25:44.955 --> 25:46.923
Hey. Hey.

25:48.976 --> 25:51.728
I have faith in you.

26:03.807 --> 26:05.775
- What?
- Nothing.

26:05.809 --> 26:09.696
It's just I feel kind of guilty.

26:09.747 --> 26:13.616
I'm drinking wine and my
daughter's living in a sober house.

26:14.935 --> 26:18.738
Don't feel guilty. It was
really brave of you to open up today.

26:18.772 --> 26:20.773
How do you feel?

26:20.824 --> 26:23.610
Less empowered than I hoped I would.

26:25.663 --> 26:28.631
You know, I really get
what you're going through.

26:28.666 --> 26:31.684
I really get what's it's
like having a teen in recovery.

26:31.719 --> 26:32.852
My son's a little older than Maddie,

26:32.903 --> 26:36.739
but he's been struggling
with addiction since he was 15.

26:36.790 --> 26:40.660
Sorry. It must be hard.

26:40.711 --> 26:42.911
It's no harder than what
other people are going through.

26:43.797 --> 26:46.633
Took me awhile to even realize
he had a problem.

26:46.684 --> 26:49.018
He was using, dealing.

26:50.654 --> 26:51.988
It was a lot.

26:53.741 --> 26:55.992
How's he doing now?

26:55.994 --> 26:59.596
He's using again,
rejecting help. His classic pattern.

27:00.981 --> 27:03.900
I blamed myself for
all of it for way too long.

27:03.951 --> 27:07.587
Now the only stuff that I
take responsibility for is my part.

27:09.006 --> 27:11.891
What I've done. You know what I mean?

27:13.560 --> 27:16.562
I, uh... definitely.

27:21.001 --> 27:22.001
Hey.

27:24.922 --> 27:27.006
Hi.

27:27.057 --> 27:28.841
So...

27:30.928 --> 27:32.912
I missed you.

27:32.947 --> 27:34.914
It's really good to see you.

27:36.867 --> 27:39.802
I'd offer to help you with packing...

27:40.971 --> 27:43.840
but I don't want you to leave.

27:43.891 --> 27:44.857
No one does.

27:45.993 --> 27:49.779
It's honestly so boring without you.

27:49.781 --> 27:52.832
I've been beating everyone at
Ping Pong without a worthy opponent.

27:52.883 --> 27:54.801
And there isn't anyone else in here

27:54.852 --> 27:57.720
who understands how
great reality shows are.

27:57.771 --> 27:59.739
When I watch them with
Vern, it's just...

27:59.773 --> 28:01.824
You don't get it.

28:01.859 --> 28:03.826
I'm leaving because of you.

28:03.877 --> 28:06.663
This is all your fault.

28:06.714 --> 28:07.847
I hate you.

28:14.022 --> 28:17.349
Okay. I'm not sure what...

28:17.350 --> 28:19.301
How could you do that to me?

28:19.336 --> 28:20.486
I honestly don't know what I...

28:20.488 --> 28:24.239
The pill, Maddie. The pill.

28:24.274 --> 28:27.259
There were only two
things I had in this world,

28:27.294 --> 28:28.454
two things...

28:28.461 --> 28:31.297
my little girl and my sobriety.

28:32.465 --> 28:35.367
And one of them...

28:41.291 --> 28:44.293
Well, I never really had the one thing.

28:46.196 --> 28:48.436
But I did have my sobriety.

28:49.366 --> 28:51.333
I was really proud of that.

28:51.368 --> 28:53.335
Then you gave me that pill.

28:53.370 --> 28:55.220
I really just wanted to help.

28:55.255 --> 28:57.256
It wasn't even a real Xanax.

28:57.258 --> 29:00.192
It was an antacid. It
was a placebo effect

29:00.226 --> 29:01.560
just for you to calm down.

29:01.611 --> 29:03.112
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

29:03.163 --> 29:04.196
Craig already told me.

29:04.247 --> 29:06.532
It doesn't matter.

29:06.583 --> 29:08.283
I took the pill, Maddie.

29:08.335 --> 29:10.252
I thought it was real.

29:11.588 --> 29:13.555
My sponsor says that it doesn't count.

29:13.590 --> 29:15.174
Craig says that it doesn't count.

29:15.176 --> 29:18.510
But me? I say that it does count.

29:20.180 --> 29:21.513
And now...

29:22.565 --> 29:24.183
I'm back to day one.

29:26.152 --> 29:28.153
You ruined everything.

29:29.289 --> 29:30.539
Please.

29:31.624 --> 29:33.175
Just go away.

30:00.687 --> 30:03.522
Can I please have a
moment with Craig in private?

30:03.524 --> 30:06.004
Nope. Not going to happen.

30:09.245 --> 30:11.613
- You told him.
- No. No, of course not.

30:11.664 --> 30:13.532
It wasn't really hard to
put two and two together.

30:13.566 --> 30:15.501
Please, just give us a second.

30:15.503 --> 30:17.219
Seriously, not going to happen.

30:17.253 --> 30:20.973
I am never leaving you
two alone ever again.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.840
Five minutes tops.

30:29.482 --> 30:32.451
So, I'm sorry about the Paul thing.

30:32.502 --> 30:34.670
And the Vern thing.
Everything just got out of hand.

30:34.704 --> 30:37.589
It was out of hand well before today

30:37.624 --> 30:39.591
- and we both know it.
- Yeah, that's true,

30:39.642 --> 30:41.593
but can't we just talk about it?

30:41.644 --> 30:42.644
Let's just figure this out.

30:42.679 --> 30:46.515
Cynthia, I met your fiancÃ© today.

30:48.485 --> 30:50.569
I looked him in the eye, shook his hand.

30:51.654 --> 30:54.640
He's not an abstraction
to me anymore. He's real.

30:54.674 --> 30:56.625
He is the man you're marrying.

30:56.676 --> 30:59.511
I care about you, Craig.

31:04.484 --> 31:05.517
Yeah.

31:07.437 --> 31:09.488
We have to stop.

31:09.522 --> 31:12.441
We can't continue seeing each
other. It isn't right.

31:12.492 --> 31:13.525
Hey.

31:15.411 --> 31:18.497
It's high time I took
some accountability

31:18.499 --> 31:20.466
for my role in all this.

31:39.469 --> 31:40.502
Yeah, okay, fine.

31:40.553 --> 31:43.555
Funny cat videos do
make things a little better.

31:43.590 --> 31:45.390
See? I told you.

31:47.360 --> 31:49.311
You ever feel like your
head's going to explode

31:49.362 --> 31:52.447
because life is this huge jigsaw puzzle

31:52.482 --> 31:54.333
and none of the
pieces are fitting together,

31:54.367 --> 31:55.367
nothing makes sense.

31:55.369 --> 31:59.288
You don't know what
to do or who to believe

31:59.339 --> 32:04.309
and you just want to
take a really long-ass nap.

32:04.344 --> 32:06.261
You ever feel that way?

32:06.312 --> 32:10.265
Well, I'm partial to naps, so, yes.

32:10.316 --> 32:13.235
- Okay.
- (laughing)

32:13.286 --> 32:17.206
Yeah, hey. Could you give us a minute?

32:18.408 --> 32:21.426
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

32:26.466 --> 32:28.217
Rebecca: Hey.

32:31.437 --> 32:35.240
So, Trish hates me.

32:35.275 --> 32:36.325
I just tried to get her to stay

32:36.359 --> 32:38.279
and she told me that I'm
the reason she's leaving.

32:38.294 --> 32:39.494
Hey, don't take that to heart.

32:41.331 --> 32:43.248
She's hurting so much right now.

32:43.299 --> 32:45.217
She was just lashing out.

32:45.268 --> 32:48.353
- This is really bad.
- It's awful for Trish.

32:48.388 --> 32:52.224
It is, but it has
absolutely nothing to do with you.

32:52.226 --> 32:55.694
She's really mad and
she's just projecting.

32:55.696 --> 32:58.280
People do it all the time.

32:58.331 --> 33:00.198
I sure have.

33:06.256 --> 33:08.307
To say this feels great is...

33:08.341 --> 33:11.593
there aren't even really
any words to describe it.

33:14.397 --> 33:17.232
There was a point not too long ago...

33:18.351 --> 33:20.619
30 days ago to be precise,

33:20.621 --> 33:23.255
when this didn't seem possible.

33:24.374 --> 33:26.291
I'd given up.

33:26.293 --> 33:28.210
I really had.

33:28.261 --> 33:31.263
But someone had faith in me,

33:31.314 --> 33:35.567
and I'm so grateful that he did.

33:37.654 --> 33:39.288
And I'm doing so much better,

33:39.322 --> 33:42.324
but I still want to rip
my hair out some days.

33:42.375 --> 33:46.662
And I'm still really angry...

33:46.713 --> 33:50.549
angry at the people who did this to me,

33:50.551 --> 33:52.601
like my ex-best friend.

33:52.635 --> 33:57.189
I just really hate her with
every ounce of my being.

33:57.191 --> 34:00.525
Hey. Well done. Well done, Rebecca.

34:00.576 --> 34:03.528
Really, you're
making tremendous strides,

34:03.579 --> 34:07.215
and we're all very, very proud of you.

34:09.217 --> 34:12.521
And I think you're about ready

34:12.554 --> 34:15.524
to start working on
letting some of that anger go.

34:17.560 --> 34:20.445
That anger was only hurting me.

34:21.496 --> 34:23.614
I was so mad, and I blamed you

34:23.666 --> 34:27.168
for so many things that had absolutely
nothing to do with you.

34:28.504 --> 34:31.473
And that wasn't okay. It really wasn't.

34:32.675 --> 34:35.427
And I'm so glad you forgave me.

34:37.230 --> 34:39.563
Do you know how amazing it
is to have my best friend back?

34:39.614 --> 34:42.534
Oh, you know, I don't know.

34:42.568 --> 34:45.570
It's only just... it's okay for me.

34:45.572 --> 34:47.406
Hey, come here.

35:09.879 --> 35:11.913
So, I've been doing a
lot of thinking about this

35:11.915 --> 35:15.801
and I realized that I've been Craig.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.886
And I've been Paul.

35:17.888 --> 35:20.856
I've been the other man and
the boyfriend who got cheated on,

35:20.890 --> 35:22.974
and the thing is, somebody
always gets hurt.

35:23.025 --> 35:24.860
Do you think I don't know that?

35:24.911 --> 35:27.071
I think you're paralyzed by it.

35:27.830 --> 35:28.964
Do you remember what you told John

35:28.998 --> 35:30.832
when you found out he
was cheating on me?

35:30.834 --> 35:33.835
No, that was so long ago.

35:33.837 --> 35:36.838
Well, lucky or unlucky for you, I do.

35:36.889 --> 35:38.145
You told him he just needed to rip

35:38.146 --> 35:40.833
that Band-Aid off and make a decision.

35:40.860 --> 35:42.894
The irony.

35:42.945 --> 35:45.747
My own words coming
back to bite me in the ass.

35:45.781 --> 35:48.750
It was good advice then.

35:48.784 --> 35:50.064
It is now.

35:50.870 --> 35:52.771
The other thing that
you said to him was...

35:52.805 --> 35:54.923
That I wouldn't respect him until
he did it, ripped it off.

35:54.974 --> 35:56.758
Yep.

36:12.708 --> 36:14.743
Paul, hi.

36:14.794 --> 36:17.879
I just wanted to let you
know that I am on the way home.

36:17.914 --> 36:21.683
Oh, okay. Do you mind waiting up for me?

36:21.685 --> 36:23.685
There's something I
need to talk to you about.

36:24.820 --> 36:26.655
Margarita: Trish!

36:29.692 --> 36:31.710
- Where's my towel?
- Hmm?

36:31.744 --> 36:34.713
I know you took it, and if
you're leaving, I want it back.

36:34.747 --> 36:36.665
I don't have your damn towel.

36:36.699 --> 36:37.749
Yeah, well, I don't believe you.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.668
Wait, that's not cool.

36:39.670 --> 36:41.736
I'm trying to be organized with...

36:41.771 --> 36:44.723
Wait, you know I don't have your towel.

36:44.774 --> 36:46.641
You're just using this as a lame excuse

36:46.643 --> 36:48.610
to come in here and
try to convince me to stay.

36:48.661 --> 36:50.612
But guess what. It's
not going to happen.

36:50.663 --> 36:52.781
Doesn't matter to me if
you stay or if you go.

36:54.667 --> 36:56.668
- Really?
- Really.

36:59.589 --> 37:02.557
- Oh.
- But I think you're being stupid.

37:05.695 --> 37:07.612
Why?

37:12.702 --> 37:16.538
You... you have such...

37:16.589 --> 37:19.674
a wonderful
opportunity to do everything right

37:19.709 --> 37:21.543
before you have a child.

37:22.678 --> 37:25.764
You don't have to
apologize to the one you neglected.

37:25.798 --> 37:29.601
You get to be the best version of you

37:29.635 --> 37:32.020
before you bring life into this world.

37:33.706 --> 37:35.624
And you're not seeing that?

37:36.792 --> 37:39.044
That's what makes you stupid.

37:45.051 --> 37:46.685
I just...

37:49.105 --> 37:52.023
I miss my little girl.

37:53.075 --> 37:55.026
Yes. Yes.

37:55.077 --> 37:57.612
I really, really miss her.

37:59.615 --> 38:01.616
And I've missed you.

38:05.004 --> 38:08.623
So you're not going anywhere, you hear?

38:11.043 --> 38:13.545
You stay sober for me.

38:17.049 --> 38:18.683
Thanks again for dinner.

38:18.718 --> 38:20.018
It was nice.

38:20.052 --> 38:22.637
We should do it again soon.

38:22.688 --> 38:24.022
I'd love that.

38:27.026 --> 38:29.027
I'm going to tell Maddie.

38:29.061 --> 38:31.646
- I have to.
- That's good.

38:31.697 --> 38:33.565
It's good you're going
to be honest with her.

38:33.616 --> 38:36.701
Yeah, she might hate me

38:36.736 --> 38:38.656
and not talk to me for awhile, but...

38:40.072 --> 38:42.991
I need to take
responsibility for my part, right?

38:43.042 --> 38:44.576
Right.

38:53.085 --> 38:55.003
Hey, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.

38:55.005 --> 38:57.672
Wait up. Wait up.

38:57.674 --> 39:00.925
Look...

39:00.976 --> 39:04.512
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about Harper.

39:05.681 --> 39:07.649
It's cool. It's really cool.

39:07.683 --> 39:09.567
I should never...

39:09.602 --> 39:11.519
I'm sorry for following you.

39:11.570 --> 39:13.521
Being worried is no excuse.

39:13.572 --> 39:14.656
Really, it was not my finest moment.

39:14.690 --> 39:16.691
It's all good, okay?

39:18.577 --> 39:20.945
- Really.
- Hey, you're still here.

39:22.031 --> 39:24.999
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

39:25.034 --> 39:27.535
Well, no, not exactly. But it will be.

39:28.671 --> 39:29.951
Good night, guys.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.674
Good night.

39:35.044 --> 39:37.712
So, that thing you said earlier

39:37.714 --> 39:39.964
about us not being as
close as you thought?

39:40.015 --> 39:42.550
It's not true...

39:42.601 --> 39:44.018
for me, anyway.

39:46.055 --> 39:47.639
Cool.

39:47.690 --> 39:50.024
It's not for me, either.

39:51.727 --> 39:53.645
Good.

40:01.036 --> 40:03.037
(cell phone ringing)

40:09.628 --> 40:10.748
What?

40:14.083 --> 40:16.050
What? What is it?

40:17.753 --> 40:19.671
What?

40:19.722 --> 40:23.007
I thought someone had
my back who doesn't

40:23.058 --> 40:24.642
and I've got to go do something.

40:24.677 --> 40:26.745
So, will you cover for me with Craig?

40:26.779 --> 40:28.730
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

40:29.765 --> 40:31.015
Yes.

40:40.109 --> 40:42.026
Oh, Donna Marie, hi.

40:42.077 --> 40:45.029
It entirely slipped my
mind that I had called you.

40:45.080 --> 40:49.667
My apologies for having
you come over here today

40:49.702 --> 40:52.036
and for being a bit of an alarmist.

40:52.087 --> 40:55.123
It's late, you should get...

40:55.125 --> 40:57.959
You weren't being an alarmist.

40:58.010 --> 40:59.627
Look at what I found.
