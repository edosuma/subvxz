00:03.937 --> 00:06.507
Explain to me again
why your Model UN tournament's

00:06.607 --> 00:07.875
being held at Shay What?!

00:07.975 --> 00:09.977
They double-booked
the school's auditorium,

00:10.078 --> 00:12.580
and the debate team
quickly and concisely

00:12.680 --> 00:14.548
convinced them
to bump us out.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.785
You'll never guess
what just happened.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.487
Your manager Paul
got you an audition

00:19.587 --> 00:21.822
for The Great Big Globetrot?

00:21.922 --> 00:23.891
Our walls are very thin.

00:23.991 --> 00:26.494
You mean, the reality show
where teams compete in a race

00:26.594 --> 00:27.928
for a cash prize so large,

00:28.028 --> 00:30.098
it could lift entire communities
out of poverty?

00:30.198 --> 00:31.765
Exactly!

00:31.865 --> 00:35.469
Paul said the producers love
my child Internet star angle.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.705
They know you're not
a child now, right?

00:37.805 --> 00:40.808
Anyway, my partner and I just
have to make an intro video,

00:40.908 --> 00:43.277
and then go to
an audition challenge tomorrow.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.946
Listen, I know
I'm the obvious choice.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.348
For a race?

00:47.448 --> 00:48.816
I've seen you get car sick
in an elevator.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.619
That elevator went faster
than normal elevators.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.722
But tomorrow is Model UN,
and Millicent needs me.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.657
I'm the Gayle to her Oprah.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.359
Oh yeah!
Millicent, aren't you gonna beat

00:58.459 --> 00:59.760
your nemesis,
Henry Von Biedermeyer?

00:59.860 --> 01:02.463
He's won the Golden Gavel
four years running.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.932
But this year,
that gavel is mine.

01:05.032 --> 01:08.802
I can taste it.
It's metallic, like blood.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.306
Ooh, Millicent, I know
exactly what you mean.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.908
I just landed
the most exciting job

01:15.008 --> 01:16.644
of my career since Dutch.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.846
I'm styling four fabulous
drag queens

01:18.946 --> 01:21.682
for their club's annual
Hollywood Icon Night.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.684
Wait, what does that
have to do with her thing?

01:23.784 --> 01:25.586
Oh, I was just changing
the subject.

01:25.686 --> 01:26.987
But if y'all wanna keep talking

01:27.087 --> 01:28.556
about a boring
children's political event,

01:28.656 --> 01:30.991
then sure, let's do that.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.726
Wait, wait, wait.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.662
So, if none of us
are gonna be your partner,

01:34.762 --> 01:37.331
- then that means...
- Spencer's gonna do it!

01:38.332 --> 01:41.235
It's always been my dream
to be on a reality TV show.

01:41.335 --> 01:45.038
My audition
for Naked and Afraid was choice!

01:45.139 --> 01:46.140
What's in the pack, dude?

01:46.240 --> 01:47.741
Rocks, to help me
be strong.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.811
When we were kids, Spencer and I
crushed every game night.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.880
We were the best team ever.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.282
Ha!
Oh!

01:54.382 --> 01:57.785
Yeah.
I think y'all are gonna win.

02:30.351 --> 02:33.387
Well, if Malaysia had better
garbage-sorting processes...

02:33.487 --> 02:34.988
If Norway can't be bothered

02:35.088 --> 02:37.090
to separate trash
from recyclables,

02:37.191 --> 02:39.660
then Malaysia's gonna send
that trash back home.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.096
'Cause that's what you are,
Henry Von Biedermeyer,

02:43.197 --> 02:45.065
the king of garbage.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.302
Geez, Millicent, I feel like
my race to win a million dollars

02:48.402 --> 02:50.704
is less intense
than your Model UN tournament.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.674
Yeah, you don't want it as bad.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.977
Thanks for helping me, Dad.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.447
I couldn't destroy
Von Biedermeyer without you.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.517
Okay.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.952
I'm in huge trouble.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.119
Why?

03:06.220 --> 03:07.755
Millicent's teacher
reached out

03:07.855 --> 03:10.391
and asked me to get her
to tone it down.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.926
Wait.
Millicent, tone it down?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.595
- Mm-hmm.
- That's like asking

03:14.695 --> 03:17.064
Ricky Martin to be less sexy.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.467
Never gonna happen.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.635
Well, apparently
she is so competitive,

03:21.735 --> 03:23.904
she already drove out
seven other participants.

03:24.004 --> 03:27.107
There's no South America now.
It's just gone.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.377
I'm worried
she's turning into Spencer.

03:29.477 --> 03:32.145
What?
But Spencer was never like that.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.947
- Remember how much fun

03:34.047 --> 03:36.183
we had at game nights
when we were kids?

03:39.453 --> 03:41.955
Way to go, Carly, it's like
you're not even trying.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.857
Now, put the green piece here.

03:43.957 --> 03:47.295
- You destroy every game.

03:47.395 --> 03:50.631
I have to go.
My mom's having GI problems.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.535
See?
He can't take us.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.504
Mm-mm.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.606
Oh, to be young.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.275
And bossed around
by your big brother.

04:01.375 --> 04:05.446
Spencer never bossed me around.
He just loves to win.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.880
You know who he's like?

04:06.980 --> 04:08.916
- Seabiscuit.
- Kim Jong-un.

04:09.717 --> 04:10.684
Seabiscuit?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.286
Yeah, 'cause he's determined,

04:12.386 --> 04:14.522
he never gives up,
and he's liable to poop

04:14.622 --> 04:16.056
absolutely anywhere.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.627
Wait, did you say
Kim Jong-un?

04:19.727 --> 04:21.895
Did you say anywhere?

04:25.232 --> 04:28.636
Ladies of substance...

04:28.736 --> 04:32.005
Auntie Histamine,
Kimmy Kimmy Moore,

04:32.105 --> 04:33.474
Cruella Tensions,

04:33.574 --> 04:36.310
and the wickedly talented
Lana del Slay,

04:36.410 --> 04:39.980
I am honored that you chose me
to style your drag night.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.382
As you should be.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.051
We are some
choosy bitches.

04:46.219 --> 04:49.222
First, a classic Audrey.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.725
- A woman waits her whole life

04:51.825 --> 04:53.861
for a pearl necklace
that thick.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.698
You will always love this--
Whitney.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.468
The one and only time

05:00.568 --> 05:02.703
someone has ever improved
on Dolly Parton.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.673
Third, we have Marilyn.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.809
I even figured out a way
to install a fan

05:08.909 --> 05:10.243
to make the wind blow.

05:10.344 --> 05:13.847
Oh, who is this wind,
and how do I meet him?

05:14.948 --> 05:17.518
And our final look,
little more modern,

05:17.618 --> 05:19.587
but still iconic.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.088
- Reese.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.793
I am, for lack
of a better word, agog.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.928
Ooh, amazing!

05:28.028 --> 05:30.163
Now, you all just have to choose
which look you want.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.900
- Any preferences?
-Reese!

05:33.000 --> 05:35.335
What?
I already pulled wardrobe.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.737
You can't all be Reese.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.039
Well, with a good enough
stylist, we can.

05:39.139 --> 05:42.510
Alexa, find us
a better stylist.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.149
Wait!
No, I can do it.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.485
I can make all four of you
Reese Witherspoon.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.253
Yay, thank you, Harper.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.122
Harper, you brought
the town together

05:55.222 --> 05:56.490
and saved the day,

05:56.590 --> 05:58.526
just like Reese Weatherspoon
in Pleasantville,

05:58.626 --> 05:59.993
Reese Witherspoon
in Home Again,

06:00.093 --> 06:01.895
and Reese Witherspoon
in Legally Blonde

06:01.995 --> 06:03.931
Red, White and Blonde.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.535
Well, buckle up, bitches,

06:07.635 --> 06:11.271
'cause it's gonna be
an embarrassment of Reeses.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.708
Reese! Reese! Reese!

06:14.808 --> 06:18.646
Reese! Reese!
Reese! Reese! Reese!

06:20.380 --> 06:21.715
So, what were you thinking

06:21.815 --> 06:23.283
for your Great Big Globetrot
intro video?

06:23.383 --> 06:26.920
Well, I set up
a spaghetti taco station.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.456
- Ooh.
- I thought we could talk

06:28.556 --> 06:29.790
about how Spencer invented 'em.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.825
- Ah.
- That man could fly to the sun

06:31.925 --> 06:33.360
if he put his mind to it.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.396
These rich people need to stop
going into space.

06:37.565 --> 06:40.267
Hey, I came up with the most fun
idea for our video.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.702
Already done.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.805
Some think artistic perfection
can't be achieved.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.674
Uh, they haven't seen this.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.056
Whoo!

07:03.156 --> 07:05.158
But shouldn't I be
in our team video?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.461
Nah.
See you guys later.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.164
Ah.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.834
What?
That wasn't so bad.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.435
Come on, Carly,
this is exactly

07:15.536 --> 07:17.304
what he's been doing
since we were kids.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.706
Oh, I don't think so.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.108
Oh, no?
Think harder.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.980
Oh, way to go, Carly.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.949
It's like
you're not even trying.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.450
Now, put the green piece there.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.786
You destroy every game.

07:32.886 --> 07:36.223
I have to go.
My mom's having GI problems.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.426
See?
He can't take us.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.362
Was that a flick?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.034
Hey!

07:48.936 --> 07:51.138
Oh, my God.
You're right!

07:51.238 --> 07:54.508
Except for the thick shiny hair,
he's not like Seabiscuit at all.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.809
- Mm.
- Wait.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.045
So, your mom didn't have
GI problems?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.647
No, she did,
I just didn't need

07:59.747 --> 08:01.014
to leave game night
because of them.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.084
- You chose to.
- I'm a good boy.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.561
Spencer, I know
you wanted to train

08:13.661 --> 08:14.828
for the audition challenge,

08:14.928 --> 08:16.997
but I want to talk to you
about our video.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.800
Well, I guess your video.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.001
What is that?!

08:21.101 --> 08:23.203
Precipitation.
Ever heard of it, Carly?

08:23.303 --> 08:24.638
Dude, we live in Seattle.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.640
On The Globetrot,
you gotta be prepared

08:26.740 --> 08:29.242
to compete in any
and all conditions--

08:29.342 --> 08:31.511
rain, sleet, snow,
sharknadoes.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.746
I need to talk to you
about the video--

08:32.846 --> 08:34.882
No!
Stop flapping your gums

08:34.982 --> 08:37.718
and start working your guns.
Drop and give me 20.

08:37.818 --> 08:38.819
- Spencer, I am not gonna--

08:38.919 --> 08:40.654
- Go, go, go!
- What?

08:40.754 --> 08:42.590
Clap in between 'em.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.826
We really need
to discuss the--

08:45.926 --> 08:47.928
Jumping jacks!

08:48.028 --> 08:49.630
- What?
- Twist.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.498
Now you're in
the rain forest.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.767
But look out,
the wind is picking up.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.773
Get your vitamins.
Drink, don't think.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.277
What is in this?!

09:04.377 --> 09:06.379
Chilis, cayenne,
and some ghost jalapeños

09:06.479 --> 09:08.782
I got off a shaman
in Little Oaxaca.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.251
Food challenges are a huge part
of The Globetrot.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.987
No, Spencer, I need to...

09:14.087 --> 09:15.522
Ah...

09:15.623 --> 09:17.490
Oh, my God,
my mouth is on fire.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.393
I think I'm gonna...

09:20.493 --> 09:22.095
No, you can throw up
in the smoothie cup,

09:22.195 --> 09:24.598
but you will have to drink
the vomit after.

09:28.836 --> 09:31.872
I stayed up all night,
I sewed until my fingers bled,

09:31.972 --> 09:34.074
I watched so many
Reese Witherspoon movies

09:34.174 --> 09:37.010
that when I tried to scream,
all that came out was sunshine.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.047
But I got it done.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.618
Girl, you read us all wrong.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.386
Now, what now?

09:46.486 --> 09:48.922
You think
I'm Elle Woods?

09:49.022 --> 09:51.892
I obviously emanate
the bubbly-yet-powerful charisma

09:51.992 --> 09:54.795
of Melanie Carmichael,
née Smooter,

09:54.895 --> 09:57.765
from Sweet Home Alabama.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.800
Girl, she didn't even
make the costume

09:59.900 --> 10:01.769
from Sweet Home Alabama.

10:01.869 --> 10:05.272
39% on Rotten Tomatoes?
Now, that's homophobic.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.174
And I'm clearly

10:07.274 --> 10:09.810
Kate "Cootie" Kinkaid
from Four Christmases.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.680
Wait, stop!
I worked really hard on this.

10:12.780 --> 10:13.914
You can't just do that.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.615
Girl!
Move some paper

10:15.716 --> 10:18.819
with a piece of tape on it?
Henny, I just did.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.188
Harper, you can't interfere
with fate.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.255
That's why it's fate.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.659
Well, well, well.

10:25.759 --> 10:29.029
Look who just quoted
Tracy Flick.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.265
The very bitch
I picked to dress like her.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.139
If I could go back in time,

10:39.239 --> 10:41.441
I wouldn't do a damn thing
differently.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.011
Cheryl Strayed, Wild.

10:45.779 --> 10:49.717
Alexa, we found
a really good stylist.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.324
"So, that's why in the spirit
of world peace,

10:57.424 --> 11:01.028
we are pleased to compromise
with the Kingdom of Norway."

11:01.128 --> 11:03.396
Do you mind if I make some edits
to the speech you wrote?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.998
Yeah.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.269
I just want you

11:09.369 --> 11:11.104
to get along better
with your classmates,

11:11.204 --> 11:12.773
and for your teacher
to stop calling me

11:12.873 --> 11:14.241
to say she's afraid of you.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.409
She carries a squirrel around
on the weekends

11:16.509 --> 11:17.811
so people will talk to her.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.680
So, maybe we don't
take her advice.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.018
Can you just try?
For me?

11:25.118 --> 11:29.122
Sure, I can try
to "dial down" my "intensity"

11:29.222 --> 11:31.959
because it's "intimidating"
to "losers."

11:32.059 --> 11:34.194
I'm not asking you to do that,
I am just asking you

11:34.294 --> 11:36.663
to make your Model UN speech
less hostile.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.966
That's literally
what I just said.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.804
Now we're in Antarctica!
It's raining ice!

11:43.904 --> 11:46.907
You just saw a penguin,
he looks like a little butler.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.175
But you can't talk to him.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.377
Do I have time
to use the bathroom?

11:50.477 --> 11:52.512
None!
Pee as you run, Carly!

11:52.612 --> 11:54.281
Pee as you run!

11:55.382 --> 11:57.584
Okay, my Reese's pieces.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.953
After four
emergency alterations

12:00.053 --> 12:03.123
and several renditions
of a cappella "Respect,"

12:03.223 --> 12:05.192
are y'all finally ready?

12:05.292 --> 12:07.394
We are!

12:07.494 --> 12:10.730
Ow, and we look
spectacular!

12:11.731 --> 12:14.768
Honey, you turned us out!

12:16.036 --> 12:20.340
I am a Christmas bell.
Jingle!

12:21.909 --> 12:23.877
Whoever said Harper
couldn't pull this off

12:23.977 --> 12:26.713
was seriously misguided.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.149
Well, ladies,
we could go on and on

12:29.249 --> 12:31.885
about how I masterfully
wove you into the fabric

12:31.985 --> 12:33.887
of the Witherspoon
cinematic universe,

12:33.987 --> 12:35.856
but if you don't get going,
you'll miss drag night.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.625
Oh!
Drag night!

12:40.828 --> 12:42.562
Was canceled.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.331
Yeah, the emcee called
two hours ago.

12:44.431 --> 12:48.201
The club was sold.
It's becoming a Baby Gap.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.339
So, all this work
was for nothing?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.574
Wait, why did y'all
make that grand entrance?

12:54.674 --> 12:57.177
Why do Trader Joe's employees
look at one item in your cart

12:57.277 --> 13:00.547
and say, "Oh, I haven't
tried that yet"?

13:00.647 --> 13:02.349
It's in our nature.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.092
No.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.828
You know who wouldn't
stand for this?

13:14.928 --> 13:16.964
- Reese Witherspoon.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.798
You're going to have
that drag night,

13:18.899 --> 13:23.937
even if I have to bend
and snap somebody's neck.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.172
Ooh!

13:27.707 --> 13:29.609
We're going to the audition
in a limo?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.811
Yeah.
That way, we get there faster.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.646
It's a longer car.
The math works.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.149
Well, why are we sitting
in the front?

13:36.249 --> 13:38.718
So we get there sooner.
Keep up!

13:38.818 --> 13:41.221
Hi, iCarly.
I'm Raoul.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.990
Can you believe
it's my first day

13:43.090 --> 13:45.225
and I get to chauffeur
a celebrity?

13:45.325 --> 13:46.726
First day?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.862
- My wife made sandwiches.
- Oh.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.197
If you like egg salad

13:50.297 --> 13:51.764
with the freaking perfect
amount of dill,

13:51.865 --> 13:53.033
you're in for a treat.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.767
Raoul, I'm gonna
need you to drive

13:54.868 --> 13:56.036
like you just realized
you forgot

13:56.136 --> 13:57.770
your wife's sandwiches at home.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.739
Oh.
This is too real.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.341
You can do this, Raoul.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.675
Okay.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.945
I can't believe
I'm really in a limo!

14:05.045 --> 14:07.414
- Whee!

14:07.514 --> 14:09.582
You will arrive
at your destination

14:09.682 --> 14:10.951
in 17 minutes.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.752
In half a mile,
turn right.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.987
You know what, Raoul?

14:14.087 --> 14:15.288
Hang a left up here,
it's a shortcut.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.925
What?
No, the GPS literally says...

14:18.025 --> 14:19.960
- New route detected.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.995
You will arrive in 23 minutes.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.297
Ooh, more time
in the limo!

14:24.397 --> 14:26.833
- Spencer!
- It's okay, it's okay.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.735
- Hey, turn right.
- Turning right.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.238
You will arrive
in 31 minutes.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.073
Raoul, just stop
listening to Spencer.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.741
- Take the freeway.
- No, Raoul,

14:34.841 --> 14:36.776
stop listening to Carly,
she's always wrong.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.145
A little bit about me.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.680
Conflict really exacerbates
my eczema.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.615
Can one of you
pass me my skin ointment?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.084
It's right next
to the egg salad.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.119
Look, can we please
just take the freeway?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.388
It's faster.
The on-ramp is on the right.

14:48.488 --> 14:49.722
No, take Ballard Bridge.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.024
We can make up the time we lost.
Turn left.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.460
Could you just
listen to me for once?

14:53.560 --> 14:54.494
Left or right?

14:54.594 --> 14:55.595
- Left!
- Right!

14:55.695 --> 14:56.796
Raoul, turn left right now!

15:00.900 --> 15:02.235
Why did we stop?
What's happening?

15:02.335 --> 15:03.836
Ballard Bridge
raised for ferry crossing.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.406
You will arrive in 57 minutes.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.210
Oh my God, the bridge
is gonna split in half!

15:12.045 --> 15:14.914
Raoul, here's your ointment.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.656
Spencer Shay.
Carly Shay.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.192
We're here.
We made it.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.394
- Yeah.
- Oh, the audition challenge

15:27.494 --> 15:28.761
started 20 minutes ago.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.264
I'm so sorry,
you've been disqualified.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.800
You are no longer
hot to trot.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.570
After all I did to get here,
it's over just like that?

15:37.670 --> 15:42.409
You were actually able to skip
most of the audition process

15:42.509 --> 15:44.111
because you're famous.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.779
I acknowledge my privilege.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.620
I can't believe
we got disqualified.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.155
I hate to say it, Carly, but...

15:55.255 --> 15:56.823
- Thank you for apologizing.
- ...it's all your fault.

15:56.923 --> 15:59.926
My fault?
You ignored the GPS.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.162
Yeah, what does a GPS know
that I don't?

16:02.262 --> 16:03.396
Everything.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.832
It knows everything.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.071
Was that a flick?

16:12.039 --> 16:13.640
Oh...

16:14.541 --> 16:16.676
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.547
Guys, guys, guys!
Oh!

16:20.647 --> 16:23.416
We are loving
this sibling rivalry.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.652
We want you back
in the challenge.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.387
And I want you in my bed.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.322
Oh, whoa.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.292
That was highly
inappropriate.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.826
But I meant it.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.229
You know what,
you can take him.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.730
I can't deal with him anymore.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.967
Oh, I know this is raw,
I know this is painful.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.804
I do need you
to save it for the cameras.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.239
We're out.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.176
You're a content creator, right?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.511
Some contestants
on our show

16:51.611 --> 16:55.615
get more than a million
new followers.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.451
Let's do a challenge, bro.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.487
So, it's pretty simple.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.190
Just slingshot a melon
to knock over a target

17:03.290 --> 17:05.592
and you qualify for the race.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.727
Is that target
a mom with a baby?

17:07.827 --> 17:11.998
Yeah, the fire department
uses these to practice rescues.

17:12.099 --> 17:15.335
So, which one of you
is flinging fruit?

17:15.435 --> 17:17.370
- I am!
- Fine.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.107
I'll save my melon skills
for later.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.049
- Did I hit a target?

17:30.150 --> 17:33.353
No, you hit my coworker
Benjamin.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.123
Great job.
He's insufferable.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.263
Millicent.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.598
Von Biedermeyer.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.401
Actually, I go
by Von Gavelmeyer now,

17:48.501 --> 17:51.037
because I keep winning
all these gavels.

17:51.138 --> 17:53.406
I haven't heard
anyone call you that.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.909
Then I guess you haven't been
talking to my mother.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.078
- Look, I know that it's tough

17:59.179 --> 18:01.281
to be nice, but it's really
important because--

18:01.381 --> 18:03.750
Oh, my Reese Witherspoon.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.155
Harper, what are you doing here?

18:08.255 --> 18:11.424
We needed a new venue
for drag night.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.759
Why are you here?

18:12.859 --> 18:15.061
Model UN.
I told you all about it.

18:15.162 --> 18:18.898
Oh, this is that boring
children's political event?

18:20.032 --> 18:23.970
Harper, we cannot have
drag night and Model UN.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.939
Unless...

18:28.741 --> 18:31.344
So, I guess Malaysia
will compromise on garbage

18:31.444 --> 18:33.846
and everything else,
until every last drop of joy

18:33.946 --> 18:36.949
has been sapped from the thing
they used to love most.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.120
Yay!

18:42.054 --> 18:44.191
Thank you,
delegate from Malaysia.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.160
It's not too often
you see such a young spark

18:47.260 --> 18:48.828
flicker out so quickly.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.265
Next, the chair
recognizes the delegate

18:52.365 --> 18:56.236
from Four Christmases,
Reese Witherspoon!

19:21.127 --> 19:23.162
I feel terrible that I made
Millicent tone it down.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.998
Baby, why would you
ask her to tone it down

19:26.098 --> 19:28.901
when she was clearly born
to turn it up?

19:29.902 --> 19:33.340
Millicent, that speech
was deliciously asinine.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.809
Glad Ms. Cox passed along
the message from my mother

19:36.909 --> 19:39.946
that you should tone it down.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.257
Destroy Gavelmeyer.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.160
Oh, Henry?

19:56.596 --> 19:58.331
Quick FYI.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.866
I'm out on your resolution,

19:59.966 --> 20:03.135
and I'm introducing one
to censure Norway instead.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.571
You can't do that.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.774
What are you gonna do,
throw smoked salmon on me?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.176
Dump a bottle of Voss water
on my head?

20:10.277 --> 20:11.511
Yeah, that's right.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.747
My dad researched
all of Norway's top exports,

20:14.847 --> 20:19.352
and they're pathetic,
just like you.

20:19.452 --> 20:23.790
Yes!
Drag him, mama!

20:23.890 --> 20:27.394
Now, sashay, Norway.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.363
Mommy!

20:32.299 --> 20:35.768
Yeah, there's no way
she's getting that gavel.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.004
I love my little tyrant
so much.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.448
Pretend the target
is someone you hate.

20:48.548 --> 20:49.816
I am.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.922
Uh, did the medic go home?

20:56.022 --> 20:59.125
Just listen to me,
I'm always right.

20:59.225 --> 21:02.094
No, you're not.
And you won't listen to me.

21:02.194 --> 21:04.797
When we play games,
you never have.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.033
I just wanted to win.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.501
I didn't know
it made you feel bad.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.202
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I don't know.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.904
Probably because
when we were kids

21:12.004 --> 21:13.606
you were like my hero.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.576
And I still am.
I understand.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.311
No, doofus.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.113
I've been trying
to talk to you all day.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.983
I love you, but when we play
games together now,

21:24.083 --> 21:26.085
I wanna be treated
like an equal.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.521
Guys, I'm sorry,
they're setting up

21:28.621 --> 21:31.090
for a kids' soccer game,
and we learned the hard way

21:31.190 --> 21:33.059
that you can't do that
and melon catapulting

21:33.159 --> 21:35.395
at the same time.
You need to quit.

21:36.363 --> 21:37.564
No.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.098
My sister's doing a great job,

21:39.198 --> 21:40.667
and we're not leaving
until she hits that target,

21:40.767 --> 21:42.369
which she can do,
and she's gonna do.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.438
'Cause she is my equal.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.179
You got this.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.820
- Aah!
- Spencer!

22:04.657 --> 22:05.825
Are you there?

22:05.925 --> 22:07.126
What is it?

22:07.226 --> 22:11.364
Tell my story.
But make it sound cooler.

22:12.198 --> 22:14.801
It'd be hard to make it
sound dumber.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.041
So, I didn't make it
on The Great Big Globetrot,

22:22.141 --> 22:24.143
and you didn't win
the Golden Gavel.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.278
But there's always next year.

22:26.379 --> 22:29.616
Hopefully, there won't be
a Von Biedermeyer next year.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.488
We're gonna talk about
what you just said later.

22:37.724 --> 22:38.858
What are you doing?

22:38.958 --> 22:41.728
Ah.
