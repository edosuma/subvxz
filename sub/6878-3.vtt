06:41.442 --> 06:42.694
Is that good?

out with you.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.490
-What do you mean?

06:47.490 --> 06:48.575
He didn't say that.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.451
He asked to take it offline.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.037
That's Twitter for "meet IRL."

06:52.037 --> 06:53.580
What's IRL?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.707
In Real Life.

Why? Because you

07:14.559 --> 07:18.563

it started out like this?

34:14.678 --> 34:17.096
All affection

34:14.678 --> 34:17.096
and "Let me be your mom,"

34:17.096 --> 34:20.099
and--oh, it's a setup.

34:20.099 --> 34:23.478
Mmmmaybe, maybe not.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.105
Look, Delia, our backgrounds

34:23.478 --> 34:26.105
are not that different.

34:26.105 --> 34:30.151
Nobody told us

34:26.105 --> 34:30.151
that sometimes, people stay,

34:30.151 --> 34:34.740
and they do their best

34:30.151 --> 34:34.740
to love us.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.491
And you were right

34:34.740 --> 34:36.491
about everything.

34:36.491 --> 34:37.910
I am messed up about Marco,

34:37.910 --> 34:40.328
and I try to fix

34:37.910 --> 34:40.328
everybody else's stuff 'cause

34:40.328 --> 34:43.582
I don't have the first clue

34:40.328 --> 34:43.582
to fix my own, but look,

34:43.582 --> 34:46.334
I am so proud of you

34:46.334 --> 34:51.631
for making this huge

34:46.334 --> 34:51.631
open-hearted leap.

34:54.342 --> 34:57.136
[exhales sharply]

34:54.342 --> 34:57.136
Get up.

34:57.136 --> 34:59.347
God.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.267
[giggles]

35:04.143 --> 35:07.689
-Hey. Hi.

35:04.143 --> 35:07.689
-Hey.

35:07.689 --> 35:11.317
-Where's Shrimp Boy?

35:07.689 --> 35:11.317
-Mmm. Don't know, don't care.

35:11.317 --> 35:12.945
[loud thud]

35:12.945 --> 35:18.408
Attention, party people!

35:18.408 --> 35:22.537
I just want to thank

35:18.408 --> 35:22.537
all you kick-ass people

35:22.537 --> 35:23.538
for kicking ass!

35:23.538 --> 35:25.164
Are you out of your mind?

35:25.164 --> 35:26.374
Especially you two,

35:26.374 --> 35:27.709
-the happy couple.

35:26.374 --> 35:27.709
-Adam.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.711
You guys are gonna

35:27.709 --> 35:29.711
be so happy.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.337
Adam, what the hell

35:29.711 --> 35:31.337
are you doing?

35:31.337 --> 35:32.547
And you know what?

35:32.547 --> 35:33.924
[crowd screams,

35:32.547 --> 35:33.924
glass shatters]

35:33.924 --> 35:36.342
-Right here.

35:33.924 --> 35:36.342
-Get down from here!

35:36.342 --> 35:37.510
-What are you doing?

35:36.342 --> 35:37.510
-Get down from there.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.178
Get down from there now.

35:39.178 --> 35:41.180
I'm ashamed you were

35:39.178 --> 35:41.180
ever inside of me.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.432
-Get down.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.432
-All right, mate.

35:42.432 --> 35:43.642
I think it's time

35:42.432 --> 35:43.642
for you to say good night.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.185
-Yo, easy, bro.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.185
-As they say,

35:46.185 --> 35:49.188
it's not a real party until

35:46.185 --> 35:49.188
somebody's forcibly removed.

35:49.188 --> 35:51.190
Ow. I bruise easy, okay?

35:51.190 --> 35:52.233
Take it easy.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.568
-Hey.

35:53.568 --> 35:57.238
I'm gonna go.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.407
What the hell was that?

35:59.407 --> 36:01.785
Don't tell me I missed

35:59.407 --> 36:01.785
all the fun.

36:01.785 --> 36:04.203
How about you?

36:01.785 --> 36:04.203
You okay?

36:04.203 --> 36:08.249
You seem a little...dazed.

36:08.249 --> 36:09.876
Yes.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.712
Jake dropped a huge bomb

36:09.876 --> 36:12.712
on me yesterday.

36:12.712 --> 36:16.675
-Was it a baby-shaped bomb?

36:12.712 --> 36:16.675
-Yeah.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.218
Good, I'm glad he finally

36:16.675 --> 36:19.218
manned up and told you.

36:19.218 --> 36:20.428
I mean, Max and I

36:19.218 --> 36:20.428
both told him to--

36:20.428 --> 36:22.848
Well, how long

36:20.428 --> 36:22.848
have you known?

36:22.848 --> 36:25.391
Uh, not 100% sure--

36:25.391 --> 36:28.728
How long have you known?

36:28.728 --> 36:33.817
Um, I'm gonna

36:28.728 --> 36:33.817
say a while.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.986
Abby, wait.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.986
For what it's worth,

36:35.986 --> 36:38.237
he was trying--Abby--

36:38.237 --> 36:39.447
Oh, shit.

36:39.447 --> 36:40.323
[door slams]

36:41.616 --> 36:42.659
Oh, gosh,

36:41.616 --> 36:42.659
I am sorry.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.661
-I'm so sorry.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.661
-It's okay.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.038
No. He, like,

36:44.661 --> 36:46.038
ruined the party.

36:46.038 --> 36:47.539
-Forget it.

36:46.038 --> 36:47.539
-I'm so sorry.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.666
No. It's not like he

36:47.539 --> 36:49.666
melted the butter sculpture.

36:49.666 --> 36:53.503
-You have a butter sculpture?

36:49.666 --> 36:53.503
-Jo.

36:53.503 --> 36:54.880
-Oh.

36:53.503 --> 36:54.880
-Look, the next time

36:54.880 --> 36:57.256
you decide to Tinder date,

36:54.880 --> 36:57.256
will you call me first?

36:57.256 --> 36:58.758
I could've told you that was

36:57.256 --> 36:58.758
gonna end in a disaster.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.385
The guy's

36:58.758 --> 37:00.385
a classic number one.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.261
Number one?

37:00.385 --> 37:02.261
What's a number one?

37:02.261 --> 37:03.513
I've done my fair share

37:02.261 --> 37:03.513
of swiping.

37:03.513 --> 37:04.848
Okay.

37:04.848 --> 37:06.265
You can pretty much break down

37:04.848 --> 37:06.265
the types of guys

37:06.265 --> 37:07.517
that date older

37:06.265 --> 37:07.517
or divorced women.

37:07.517 --> 37:08.727
Oh.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.062
-Number one.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.062
-Do tell.

37:10.062 --> 37:11.063
-Young guys.

37:10.062 --> 37:11.063
-Okay.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.480
Like, under 30 young.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.440
They age up because they figure

37:12.480 --> 37:14.440
you're a sure thing.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.818
You do not

37:14.440 --> 37:16.818
under any circumstance

37:16.818 --> 37:18.361
-bring them out in public.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.361
-Go on.

37:18.361 --> 37:19.863
-He's a toy.

37:18.361 --> 37:19.863
-Okay.

37:19.863 --> 37:21.280
-He's a boy. That's it.

37:19.863 --> 37:21.280
-That's fascinating.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.409
Number two,

37:21.280 --> 37:24.409
the never-been-married guy.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.327
Nine times out of ten,

37:24.409 --> 37:26.327
creepy like a serial killer.

37:26.327 --> 37:27.495
-Pass.

37:26.327 --> 37:27.495
-Okay.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.414
Number three, newly divorced

37:29.414 --> 37:32.084
and looking to unearth

37:29.414 --> 37:32.084
his long-buried libido.

37:32.084 --> 37:34.961
He's charming, but he's gonna

37:32.084 --> 37:34.961
stop messaging you as soon

37:34.961 --> 37:36.922
as he bags a 26-year-old.

37:36.922 --> 37:40.508
-Oh, that freaking prick.

37:36.922 --> 37:40.508
-Number four, just divorced.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.677
Lonely and looking

37:40.508 --> 37:42.677
to reconstitute a family.

37:42.677 --> 37:43.970
He will be

37:42.677 --> 37:43.970
your instant boyfriend,

37:43.970 --> 37:46.305
and then he will attach to you

37:43.970 --> 37:46.305
like a barnacle

37:46.305 --> 37:47.432
and suffocate you.

37:47.432 --> 37:51.811
I'm just--I'm so happy that

37:47.432 --> 37:51.811
we're having this conversation.

37:51.811 --> 37:56.983
So from now on,

37:51.811 --> 37:56.983
I'm number one-ing in private.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.777
Oh, no violence.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.319
And you're right,

37:58.777 --> 38:00.319
because it's live.

38:00.319 --> 38:01.320
So she's not gonna--

38:01.320 --> 38:02.781
No, right.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.658
Um, Carol,

38:02.781 --> 38:05.658
I'm sorry about--

38:05.658 --> 38:08.912
I--I really appreciate

38:05.658 --> 38:08.912
your gesture.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.705
That was lovely.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.373
I understand I overstepped.

38:12.373 --> 38:15.127
The thing is that I just--I

38:12.373 --> 38:15.127
barely remember my mom or Iran,

38:15.127 --> 38:18.630
but um,

38:18.630 --> 38:22.467
you made a wonderful man

38:18.630 --> 38:22.467
who I love,

38:22.467 --> 38:26.345
and we have that in common.

38:26.345 --> 38:31.350
So let's just take it slow.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.352
Okay.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.352
Thank you.

38:33.352 --> 38:37.065
Good.

38:37.065 --> 38:41.027
Would you maybe help me

38:37.065 --> 38:41.027
with the seating arrangement

38:41.027 --> 38:43.446
for the reception?

38:43.446 --> 38:45.782
You know where the bodies

38:43.446 --> 38:45.782
are buried, right?

38:45.782 --> 38:47.909
Put mortal enemies together.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.119
Oh, I'd love to.

38:49.119 --> 38:50.620
-Yes?

38:49.119 --> 38:50.620
-Yes.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.371
Okay, good. That's good.

38:52.371 --> 38:53.748
Good.

38:53.748 --> 38:59.462
This is the part

38:53.748 --> 38:59.462
where you hug.

38:59.462 --> 39:02.507
-He's such a control freak.

38:59.462 --> 39:02.507
-So bossy.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.718
[chuckling]

39:11.599 --> 39:13.643
[dog barks]

39:13.643 --> 39:15.145
Hey.

39:15.145 --> 39:16.938
How dare you?

39:16.938 --> 39:18.190
How what?

39:18.190 --> 39:19.941
You let me sit there

39:19.941 --> 39:22.401
and commend you

39:19.941 --> 39:22.401
on your growth as a person?

39:22.401 --> 39:24.154
On how open and honest you were?

39:24.154 --> 39:25.989
How long have you known

39:24.154 --> 39:25.989
that Becca was pregnant?

39:25.989 --> 39:27.448
Shh, the kids are sleeping.

39:25.989 --> 39:27.448
Calm down.

39:27.448 --> 39:29.408
No, I--how long

39:27.448 --> 39:29.408
have you known?

39:29.408 --> 39:30.869
Answer the damn question.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.204
-Whoa. About a month.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.204
-Oh my God.

39:32.204 --> 39:33.412
But she didn't know

39:32.204 --> 39:33.412
if she was going to keep it,

39:33.412 --> 39:34.664
and there was no reason

39:33.412 --> 39:34.664
to tell you.

39:34.664 --> 39:36.499
So you then,

39:34.664 --> 39:36.499
like old times,

39:36.499 --> 39:37.792
decided that it was

39:36.499 --> 39:37.792
better for me

39:37.792 --> 39:40.419
not to know while we're

39:37.792 --> 39:40.419
talking about our future?

39:40.419 --> 39:41.921
And radical honesty?

39:41.921 --> 39:44.799
You knew that you

39:41.921 --> 39:44.799
might be a father again.

39:44.799 --> 39:48.094
You knew that our kids

39:44.799 --> 39:48.094
might have a half-sibling.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.971
-It's unbelievable

39:48.094 --> 39:49.971
-Just--Jesus Christ, okay?

39:49.971 --> 39:53.641
You know, it hasn't been exactly

39:49.971 --> 39:53.641
easy to share with you, Abby.

39:53.641 --> 39:54.976
I've been very clear.

39:54.976 --> 39:56.728
I am in.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.981
I am all in, and you're the one

39:56.728 --> 39:59.981
with one foot out.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.191
-What?

39:59.981 --> 40:01.191
-Just like old times.

40:01.191 --> 40:02.567
I don't--

40:01.191 --> 40:02.567
I'm trying to think.

40:02.567 --> 40:06.029
I'm trying to think

40:02.567 --> 40:06.029
and just slow things down,

40:06.029 --> 40:08.073
and you as usual

40:06.029 --> 40:08.073
just want to dive in.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.866
-Damn the consequences.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.866
-No, you're not--

40:09.866 --> 40:11.450
A baby.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.494
-That is a huge omission.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.494
-I know.

40:13.494 --> 40:14.913
You didn't tell me about Will

40:14.913 --> 40:16.497
until you

40:14.913 --> 40:16.497
had some moral epiphany

40:16.497 --> 40:18.041
because I told you

40:16.497 --> 40:18.041
about Becca.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.210
Will does not affect

40:18.041 --> 40:20.210
the rest of our lives.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.961
Oh, no, Will affects my life,

40:21.961 --> 40:26.007
because here I am again

40:21.961 --> 40:26.007
wondering if I can trust you.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.009
Again.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.594
Well, then that just

40:28.009 --> 40:29.594
goes both ways,

40:29.594 --> 40:32.013
because I can't do

40:29.594 --> 40:32.013
this anymore, Jake.

40:32.013 --> 40:34.473
I can't keep

40:32.013 --> 40:34.473
letting you "yes" me to death

40:34.473 --> 40:37.643
while you sidestep feelings.
