<i>[Lucifer] </i>So you're telling me that 
my dickhead twin

00:15.724 --> 00:18.643
<i>showed up on Earth, assumed my identity,</i>

00:18.727 --> 00:21.354
<i>and then wreaked all sorts of havoc</i>
<i>on my life?</i>

00:21.771 --> 00:23.106
<i>That about covers it, yes.</i>

00:24.315 --> 00:26.985
<i>Great. Great, and you came down here</i>
<i>to tell me this why?</i>

00:27.068 --> 00:29.237
<i>Just to torture me? [sighs]</i>

00:29.320 --> 00:31.197
<i>I suppose this is</i>
<i>the appropriate place for it.</i>

00:31.573 --> 00:34.242
<i>Yeah, is there somewhere else</i>
<i>that we can talk?</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:37.579
<i>I don't like having private conversations</i>
<i>in the hallways,</i>

00:37.662 --> 00:39.414

00:39.497 --> 00:42.167
<i>-It's not funny. It's not funny!</i>
<i>-No.</i>

00:42.542 --> 00:43.793
<i>No, it certainly isn't.</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:46.796
<i>My slopey-shouldered brother</i>
<i>is pulling a prank</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:49.591
<i>hardly worthy of </i>Saved by the Bell

00:49.674 --> 00:52.469
<i>This isn't about you, Lucy.</i>
<i>Michael's threatened Charlie's safety.</i>

00:52.552 --> 00:53.762
<i>Oh, please.</i>

00:53.845 --> 00:56.014
<i>Michael needles people's fears.</i>

00:56.097 --> 00:57.265
<i>It's what he does.</i>

00:57.348 --> 01:00.477
<i>But we also know</i>
<i>he's all bark and no bite.</i>

01:00.560 --> 01:02.187
<i>Don't you remember, growing up?</i>

01:02.270 --> 01:04.147
<i>He'd get under your skin</i>
<i>with one of his schemes,</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:06.816
<i>then you'd give him one of your</i>
<i>atomic wedgies, and that'd be that.</i>

01:06.900 --> 01:08.818
<i>I don't think a wedgie's gonna do it</i>
<i>this time.</i>

01:10.361 --> 01:13.239

01:15.158 --> 01:16.242
<i>Last time I was there,</i>

01:16.326 --> 01:20.205
<i>Michael had managed to seat himself</i>
<i>at Father's right hand.</i>

01:22.248 --> 01:24.375
<i>So, Dad's talking to him?</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:25.543
<i>No.</i>

01:25.627 --> 01:28.129
<i>No, he's talking to Father,</i>
<i>but he's the only one.</i>

01:28.463 --> 01:30.632
<i>Nobody else in the Silver City</i>
<i>has a line to Him.</i>

01:30.715 --> 01:32.550
<i>Nobody, and Michael has seen to it.</i>

01:32.967 --> 01:33.885
<i>Michael?</i>

<i>But he is stronger than you think, Lucy.</i>

01:45.313 --> 01:46.439
<i>Michael's become...</i>

01:47.023 --> 01:48.942
<i>untouchable in the Silver City.</i>

01:50.276 --> 01:53.571
<i>Well, he's not in the Silver City now,</i>
<i>is he?</i>

01:53.655 --> 01:56.074
<i>So excuse me while I go touch him.</i>

01:58.576 --> 02:01.162
<i>I can see how that's</i>
<i>a poor choice of words.</i>

<i>Get the hell out of here.</i>

<i>I will gladly shoot you again, Michael.</i>

<i>-But...</i>

03:47.769 --> 03:49.062
<i>It's a funny story, actually.</i>

03:49.854 --> 03:51.522

03:52.440 --> 03:53.274
<i>[sighs]</i>

<i>I just... I just needed </i>

<i>-Well, good news on that front.</i>

04:33.731 --> 04:37.318
<i>Every word that comes out</i>
<i>of that admittedly dashing face is a lie.</i>

04:37.860 --> 04:41.239
<i>Oh, well, that's a relief,</i>
<i>because he said something so insane,</i>

04:41.322 --> 04:43.324

<i>That's...</i>

<i>Your mom told...</i>

<i>You've kept this the whole time?</i>

<i>Well, back then, you didn't even believe</i>
<i>in the celestial side of things.</i>

05:35.084 --> 05:37.920
<i>A-A-Anyway, Mom only told me</i>
<i>because she was trying to keep us apart.</i>

<i>Why...</i>

05:39.672 --> 05:42.800
<i>Why? 'Cause if you knew I were a gift</i>
<i>from your dad, you'd what, throw me away?</i>

<i>She thought if I knew the truth,</i>

<i>it would mean the feelings</i>

<i>But I don't feel that way,</i>

<i>I realized</i>
<i>that whether you were made for me or not,</i>

10:04.437 --> 10:06.522
<i>-This is the show that you helped Matt--</i>
<i>-Shh!</i>

10:07.273 --> 10:09.358
<i>This is the show that you helped Matt</i>
<i>get on the air?</i>

10:09.442 --> 10:10.276
<i>No, no, no.</i>

10:10.359 --> 10:12.320
<i>All I did was introduce him</i>
<i>to a network exec.</i>

10:12.403 --> 10:14.989
<i>I had no idea why he was asking me</i>
<i>so many questions.</i>

10:15.906 --> 10:18.659
<i>But I have to say, it's shocking.</i>

10:18.951 --> 10:22.705
<i>I mean, the way in which he's brought</i>
<i>my descriptions to life, the accuracy,</i>

10:22.788 --> 10:24.248
<i>is truly eerie.</i>

10:24.999 --> 10:27.918
<i>I can see why he had</i>
<i>such a meteoric rise in the biz.</i>

10:28.002 --> 10:30.004
<i>Obviously the man was a tremendous talent.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

10:30.087 --> 10:31.297
<i>-[Chloe sighs]</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

10:31.380 --> 10:32.506
<i>Oh, no, thanks.</i>

10:32.965 --> 10:33.883
<i>Huh?</i>

10:35.259 --> 10:36.427
<i>City Council...</i>

10:37.428 --> 10:38.763
<i>has asked me to present you...</i>

10:39.847 --> 10:40.723
<i>with this.</i>

10:42.600 --> 10:43.893
<i>[officers cheering]</i>

10:47.813 --> 10:49.815
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

10:50.524 --> 10:52.610
<i>But really, I should share this</i>
<i>with my partner.</i>

10:52.693 --> 10:53.569
<i>Where is she?</i>

10:53.653 --> 10:54.820
<i>Detective Dancer?</i>

10:58.991 --> 11:00.284
<i>Sorry, Diablo.</i>

11:00.368 --> 11:02.453
<i>I was just pumping a suspect for leads.</i>

11:03.788 --> 11:04.747
<i>Oh!</i>

11:04.830 --> 11:06.415
<i>Is that a commendation for you?</i>

11:06.957 --> 11:08.042
<i>For </i>us.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.503
<i>If anyone deserves this,</i>

11:10.586 --> 11:13.798
<i>it's a woman who's gone from</i>
<i>the stripper pole to the detective pool</i>

11:13.881 --> 11:15.049
<i>in just three years.</i>

11:15.549 --> 11:16.467
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

11:16.550 --> 11:18.886
<i>I think you could have given it</i>
<i>a once-over.</i>

11:18.969 --> 11:20.304
<i>It's a bit tarnished.</i>

11:20.763 --> 11:21.764
<i>[both gasp]</i>

11:22.390 --> 11:24.058
<i>Don't worry, Diablo.</i>

11:24.141 --> 11:26.894
<i>You know I'll polish your bugle any time.</i>

11:29.897 --> 11:31.732
<i>[man] And... cut!</i>

11:33.567 --> 11:35.027
<i>Great. Circle back.</i>

11:35.569 --> 11:36.445
<i>That's...</i>

11:37.238 --> 11:39.115
<i>Is that how you described me to him?</i>

11:39.699 --> 11:41.992
<i>Well, Matt didn't know everything.</i>

11:42.493 --> 11:45.413
<i>Obviously, he took some creative license.</i>

11:47.415 --> 11:48.666
<i>Are they going again?</i>

11:51.794 --> 11:52.962
<i>[stage bell rings]</i>

11:54.088 --> 11:56.424
<i>So it seems a little odd</i>
<i>that you all are shooting today,</i>

11:56.507 --> 11:58.551
<i>since your showrunner was killed</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

11:59.135 --> 12:02.096
<i>Matt would've wanted us to keep going.</i>
<i>We're the biggest hit of the fall,</i>

12:02.179 --> 12:03.431
<i>and he was really proud of that.</i>

12:04.181 --> 12:05.599
<i>People can't get enough Diablo.</i>

12:05.683 --> 12:07.268
<i>[chuckles] Hear, hear.</i>

12:07.351 --> 12:10.062
<i>Well, I think it's gross</i>
<i>that we're still working.</i>

12:10.438 --> 12:13.858
<i>I mean, in all honesty,</i>
<i>I know it's bad to speak ill of the dead,</i>

12:13.941 --> 12:15.901
<i>but I'm not surprised</i>
<i>someone stabbed Matt, either.</i>

12:16.944 --> 12:17.862
<i>Um, why not?</i>

12:17.945 --> 12:19.572
<i>The man was a control freak.</i>

12:19.655 --> 12:22.950
<i>I mean, I know all showrunners</i>
<i>have to have an ego, but...</i>

12:23.534 --> 12:25.745
<i>Matt was a megalomaniac.</i>

12:25.828 --> 12:27.872
<i>Come on. The man was an artist.</i>

12:27.955 --> 12:30.499
<i>-Sorry, is that a vape pen?</i>
<i>-Hot cinnamon.</i>

12:31.208 --> 12:32.293
<i>Keeps the weight off.</i>

12:32.376 --> 12:34.253
<i>[groans] You were doing so well.</i>

12:34.336 --> 12:36.255
<i>So, the megalomaniac showrunner,</i>

12:36.338 --> 12:37.423
<i>did he choose your wardrobe?</i>

12:37.506 --> 12:38.841
<i>All his idea.</i>

12:38.924 --> 12:40.843
<i>I wear what he gives me,</i>
<i>go where he tells me.</i>

12:41.469 --> 12:43.012
<i>Oh. Okay.</i>

12:43.304 --> 12:44.805
<i>I mean, does that bother you at all,</i>

12:44.889 --> 12:48.684
<i>that you have no say</i>
<i>in what your character does or says?</i>

12:48.768 --> 12:49.602
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

12:49.685 --> 12:52.688
<i>I'm a lead in a hit show, and you know,</i>

12:52.772 --> 12:55.816
<i>there are strippers out there</i>
<i>considering becoming detectives now.</i>

12:57.526 --> 12:58.611
<i>I'm kind of a role model.</i>

12:58.694 --> 12:59.737
<i>Oh, lovely.</i>

12:59.820 --> 13:01.113
<i>Matt gave me that.</i>

13:02.490 --> 13:03.324
<i>Interesting.</i>

13:03.908 --> 13:06.827
<i>So, anyhow, did either of you</i>
<i>have a problem with Matt?</i>

13:06.911 --> 13:08.454
<i>Us? No way.</i>

13:08.537 --> 13:10.623
<i>[inhales sharply] </i>
<i>But let me tell you something.</i>

13:11.123 --> 13:13.626
<i>I've been doing this job</i>
<i>for seven episodes now,</i>

13:13.709 --> 13:17.296
<i>and if there's one thing I've learned,</i>
<i>it's why people kill.</i>

13:17.379 --> 13:18.297
<i>Oh?</i>

13:18.714 --> 13:21.675
<i>It's 'cause they yearn for something.</i>
<i>You want to find the killer,</i>

13:22.384 --> 13:23.511
<i>figure out their yearning.</i>

13:23.594 --> 13:25.721
<i>Right. Isn't there a better word for that?</i>

13:25.805 --> 13:26.639
<i>No.</i>

13:26.806 --> 13:27.848
<i>So, okay.</i>

13:28.557 --> 13:30.518
<i>Who do you think yearned to kill Matt?</i>

13:30.893 --> 13:33.103
<i>Keri Belwood, his number two.</i>

13:33.187 --> 13:34.355
<i>You should talk to her.</i>

13:34.855 --> 13:37.024
<i>Everyone knows she did all the work</i>
<i>on the scripts</i>

13:37.107 --> 13:38.150
<i>and he took all the credit.</i>

13:38.567 --> 13:40.861
<i>So Keri killed Matt</i>
<i>to finally be in charge?</i>

13:40.945 --> 13:41.821
<i>Yes.</i>

13:42.363 --> 13:45.449
<i>Her yearning was for his job.</i>

13:46.742 --> 13:48.494
<i>Well, uh, of course, possibly.</i>

13:48.577 --> 13:50.746
<i>There could be other motives to kill him.</i>

13:51.038 --> 13:54.041
<i>Oh-oh! Sounds like we have </i>
<i>a Dancer answer.</i>

13:54.458 --> 13:55.376
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-See,</i>

13:55.459 --> 13:59.713
<i>Diablo comes up with the wild theories</i>
<i>and crazy hijinks,</i>

13:59.797 --> 14:01.090
<i>and Dancer's the fun police.</i>

14:01.549 --> 14:03.467
<i>"That's not procedure, Diablo."</i>

14:04.760 --> 14:07.054
<i>-[laughs]</i>
<i>-Mm. I get it.</i>

14:08.347 --> 14:10.766
<i>Okay. Well, thank you for your time.</i>

14:11.851 --> 14:13.060
<i>Yes. Thank you.</i>

14:15.729 --> 14:17.106
<i>Do they seem familiar to you?</i>

14:18.607 --> 14:19.817
<i>[Dancer sighs]</i>

14:20.234 --> 14:21.902
<i>So you left Amenadiel in Hell?</i>

14:21.986 --> 14:23.028
<i>[Lucifer] Really, Doctor?</i>

14:23.404 --> 14:26.240
<i>An evil twin, the detective finding out</i>
<i>she's a gift from God,</i>

14:26.323 --> 14:27.741
<i>and that's the part you're stuck on?</i>

14:28.158 --> 14:29.118
<i>Amenadiel.</i>

14:30.035 --> 14:32.329
<i>The father of my child.</i>

14:33.622 --> 14:34.582
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

14:34.665 --> 14:37.835
<i>Heh. Well, not to worry, Doctor. </i>
<i>I'll, uh...</i>

14:37.918 --> 14:40.170
<i>I'll put what Michael did right</i>
<i>and get Amenadiel back</i>

14:40.254 --> 14:42.506
<i>before Charlie even notices</i>
<i>he's gone, okay?</i>

14:42.590 --> 14:43.966
<i>But what about Michael?</i>

14:44.800 --> 14:46.260
<i>Do you even know where he is?</i>

14:46.594 --> 14:48.512
<i>Well, if past is prologue,</i>

14:48.596 --> 14:52.266
<i>he's probably hidden himself off somewhere</i>
<i>to laugh about the mess he's made...</i>

14:52.933 --> 14:55.185
<i>which is actually why I'm here.</i>

14:56.020 --> 14:58.355
<i>Michael didn't coax any awful,</i>

14:58.439 --> 15:00.691
<i>soul-poisoning fears out of you, did he?</i>

15:01.734 --> 15:02.693
<i>Me? No.</i>

15:02.776 --> 15:03.611
<i>No.</i>

15:03.819 --> 15:05.738
<i>No, not... Not out of me.</i>

15:06.071 --> 15:07.197
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-Good.</i>

15:07.948 --> 15:09.366
<i>Good, well...</i>

15:09.450 --> 15:11.118
<i>that's a relief, 'cause I worry that this</i>

15:11.201 --> 15:13.495
<i>"not having any free will</i>
<i>and being a puppet of fate" thing</i>

15:13.579 --> 15:15.497
<i>may have</i>
<i>knocked the detective off her stride.</i>

15:15.581 --> 15:16.415
<i>May have?</i>

15:17.249 --> 15:19.960
<i>Lucifer, when you come back unexpectedly</i>

15:20.419 --> 15:24.423
<i>and casually drop celestial bombs</i>
<i>on the people in your life,</i>

15:25.132 --> 15:27.676
<i>you have to expect some shock...</i>

15:28.552 --> 15:30.346
<i>some anger, some frustration.</i>

15:31.221 --> 15:34.975
<i>In my defense, this particular bomb</i>
<i>was planted by my father</i>

15:35.059 --> 15:36.560
<i>and set off by my brother, so--</i>

15:36.644 --> 15:40.064
<i>Okay, well, instead of deflecting</i>
<i>responsibility, try empathizing.</i>

15:40.731 --> 15:44.360
<i>Try really listening</i>
<i>to what your friends are saying.</i>

15:45.402 --> 15:49.114
<i>What, so if I give people the opportunity,</i>
<i>they'll tell me what to do?</i>

15:49.615 --> 15:50.991
<i>Exactly, like,</i>

15:51.075 --> 15:53.410
<i>-bring back my baby's daddy from Hell.</i>
<i>-Yes, yes. Thank you.</i>

15:53.494 --> 15:54.453
<i>I've got to go.</i>

15:54.828 --> 15:55.663
<i>To Hell?</i>

15:57.206 --> 16:00.167
<i>No, to find out what other chaos</i>
<i>Michael may have caused up here.</i>

16:00.250 --> 16:03.170
<i>I mean, who knows how many people</i>
<i>I'll have to listen to?</i>

16:03.337 --> 16:04.213
<i>[scoffs]</i>

16:10.386 --> 16:11.261
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:11.929 --> 16:14.348
<i>Keri Belwood? Detective Decker, LAPD.</i>

16:14.431 --> 16:16.100
<i>I figured I'd be your first stop.</i>

16:17.142 --> 16:18.560
<i>Why is that? In my experience,</i>

16:18.644 --> 16:21.397
<i>the innocent don't normally expect</i>
<i>to be questioned by the police.</i>

16:21.855 --> 16:24.525
<i>I've written 100 episodes</i>
<i>of TV murder mysteries</i>

16:24.608 --> 16:26.610
<i>and I got the carpal tunnel to prove it.</i>

16:26.860 --> 16:28.487
<i>Motive, opportunity...</i>

16:29.446 --> 16:30.280
<i>It adds up.</i>

16:31.281 --> 16:33.951
<i>Well, you know the math on this.</i>
<i>I can see why Matt put you in charge.</i>

16:34.827 --> 16:37.496
<i>Yeah, I was the one who was always here</i>
<i>doing most of the work,</i>

16:37.579 --> 16:39.581
<i>but I was definitely not in charge.</i>

16:39.999 --> 16:41.667
<i>Matt was the worst kind of boss:</i>

16:41.750 --> 16:43.877
<i>lazy and a control freak.</i>

16:44.461 --> 16:46.130
<i>I can see why he'd be hard to deal with.</i>

16:46.213 --> 16:47.214
<i>No, not really.</i>

16:47.339 --> 16:50.634
<i>He never even came into the writers' room.</i>
<i>I'd usually send him a script overnight,</i>

16:50.718 --> 16:53.012
<i>and by the morning,</i>
<i>it'd be completely changed.</i>

16:53.095 --> 16:56.765
<i>So you and the writers would work in here</i>
<i>well into the night,</i>

16:56.849 --> 16:58.851
<i>and then Matt would come</i>
<i>and undo all the work?</i>

16:58.934 --> 17:00.811
<i>Do you know how dispiriting it is</i>

17:00.894 --> 17:03.022
<i>to spend days figuring out</i>
<i>a clever clue path</i>

17:03.105 --> 17:05.816
<i>just for your boss to replace it</i>
<i>with a lap dance?</i>

17:06.400 --> 17:08.819
<i>Hmm. Yeah, I can see why</i>

17:08.902 --> 17:11.238
<i>you doing all that work</i>
<i>and feeling like you have no control</i>

17:11.321 --> 17:13.198
<i>could possibly make you angry.</i>

17:14.533 --> 17:17.286
<i>My assistant can vouch that</i>
<i>I was here writing all morning.</i>

17:17.369 --> 17:20.122
<i>So if you're suggesting</i>
<i>that I killed Matt to take his job,</i>

17:20.205 --> 17:21.623
<i>then you need a new theory.</i>

17:22.249 --> 17:25.794
<i>Besides, showrunners have all the power,</i>
<i>but you know what else they get?</i>

17:26.170 --> 17:27.046
<i>The blame.</i>

17:27.838 --> 17:29.757
<i>But I thought the show was doing well.</i>

17:29.840 --> 17:31.258
<i>Well, that's almost worse.</i>

17:31.842 --> 17:33.385
<i>You got a network show that's a hit,</i>

17:33.469 --> 17:36.013
<i>suddenly everybody at the studio</i>
<i>takes an interest.</i>

17:36.305 --> 17:39.016
<i>Everybody wants a piece of it,</i>
<i>and the second the ratings dip,</i>

17:39.099 --> 17:40.851
<i>everyone wants someone to blame.</i>

17:41.435 --> 17:42.269
<i>No, thanks.</i>

17:42.352 --> 17:44.563
<i>I already got two ex-husbands</i>
<i>and three kids.</i>

17:44.646 --> 17:46.774
<i>I don't need a drug problem</i>
<i>on top of that.</i>

17:47.816 --> 17:48.984
<i>Matt had a drug problem?</i>

17:50.027 --> 17:51.195
<i>All I know is,</i>

17:51.820 --> 17:53.489
<i>one night Matt's email was down,</i>

17:53.572 --> 17:55.866
<i>so I had to hand-deliver</i>
<i>a script at midnight.</i>

17:56.325 --> 18:00.287
<i>He has me bring it to a seedy motel</i>
<i>full of tweakers and burnouts.</i>

18:01.080 --> 18:02.915
<i>Insane writer under intense pressure</i>

18:02.998 --> 18:05.125
<i>holed up in a crime-infested drug den?</i>

18:06.627 --> 18:08.796
<i>Even Diablo could follow that clue path.</i>

18:10.380 --> 18:11.215
<i>I see.</i>

18:11.298 --> 18:14.551
<i>Well, I'll need you to give</i>
<i>an official statement at the precinct,</i>

18:14.635 --> 18:16.678
<i>and then also, if you have</i>
<i>the address of that motel.</i>

18:17.096 --> 18:18.138
<i>Sure.</i>

18:26.855 --> 18:27.940
<i>Oh, Michael.</i>

18:29.024 --> 18:32.903
<i>Of all the things you've done to hurt me,</i>
<i>this might cut the deepest.</i>

18:32.986 --> 18:34.196
<i>[blades scraping]</i>

18:36.365 --> 18:37.825
<i>Maze.</i>

18:38.242 --> 18:41.745
<i>Oh! I missed you while I was gone. </i>
<i>[laughs]</i>

18:42.329 --> 18:44.289
<i>You know, there was</i>
<i>a few tough nuts down there,</i>

18:44.373 --> 18:46.750
<i>and there were times</i>
<i>I could've really used your blades!</i>

18:47.876 --> 18:49.044
<i>[roars]</i>

18:50.712 --> 18:52.005
<i>[grunting]</i>

18:52.089 --> 18:53.590
<i>Mazikeen, please, let me explain.</i>

<i>-Mazikeen!</i>
<i>-[yells]</i>

18:59.304 --> 19:00.139
<i>Hey!</i>

19:07.813 --> 19:09.523
<i>-[roars]</i>
<i>-Listen to me, Mazikeen!</i>

19:09.606 --> 19:11.358
<i>I'm not Michael. It's me.</i>

19:11.692 --> 19:12.526
<i>Lucifer.</i>

19:12.609 --> 19:13.694
<i>[panting]</i>

19:14.486 --> 19:15.362
<i>Oh!</i>

19:17.030 --> 19:18.031
<i>[grunts]</i>

19:18.991 --> 19:20.617
<i>Wait. Wait, wait.</i>

19:20.701 --> 19:22.661
<i>Would you rather that I was Michael?</i>

19:22.744 --> 19:23.579
<i>Either.</i>

19:23.912 --> 19:25.914
<i>He left me in the closet, but you...</i>

19:26.832 --> 19:28.584
<i>You went to Hell without me.</i>

19:29.501 --> 19:30.919
<i>You left me!</i>

19:31.003 --> 19:33.338
<i>No, I didn't, Mazikeen.</i>

19:33.422 --> 19:36.633
<i>You're not my servant anymore.</i>
<i>By all means, you're welcome to join me.</i>

19:36.717 --> 19:38.802
<i>I don't have wings, you idiot!</i>

19:38.886 --> 19:40.179
<i>Well, Amenadiel does.</i>

19:40.262 --> 19:42.723
<i>Why didn't you just ask him </i>
<i>to fly you down there?</i>

19:43.182 --> 19:44.016
<i>[scoffs]</i>

19:50.731 --> 19:53.609
<i>[grunts] Look, I'm really trying </i>
<i>to listen,</i>

19:53.692 --> 19:56.820
<i>so if you're telling me</i>
<i>that you'd like to stab me, then...</i>

19:57.946 --> 20:00.199
<i>Just avoid the old parsnip,</i>
<i>for old time's sake.</i>

20:02.826 --> 20:05.412
<i>Well, you know, my twin is</i>
<i>still likely skulking around.</i>

20:05.495 --> 20:07.497
<i>It'd be a big help</i>
<i>if you'd like to stab him.</i>

20:09.875 --> 20:11.335
<i>Stab him yourself.</i>

20:11.835 --> 20:12.920
<i>[elevator dings]</i>

20:15.130 --> 20:16.131
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

20:21.887 --> 20:23.347
<i>Ah! Detective.</i>

20:23.513 --> 20:25.933
<i>Sorry I'm late. Forgot about the traffic.</i>

20:26.016 --> 20:27.184
<i>So, where are we going?</i>

20:27.267 --> 20:28.393
<i>Uh, Room 18.</i>

20:28.477 --> 20:30.270
<i>Oh, right. Good news.</i>

20:30.687 --> 20:33.774
<i>Linda's fine, and Maze is, well, Maze.</i>

20:34.233 --> 20:36.902
<i>And I figured out</i>
<i>how to fix things between us.</i>

20:37.736 --> 20:40.948
<i>-Oh, how's that?</i>
<i>-Well, you're going to tell me what to do.</i>

20:41.698 --> 20:44.534
<i>Ah, well, I'm sure that makes sense</i>
<i>to someone.</i>

20:44.618 --> 20:45.452
<i>Yes.</i>

20:45.535 --> 20:48.080
<i>Anyhow, so Matt had no family,</i>
<i>lived alone...</i>

20:48.163 --> 20:50.332
<i>If he had a drug problem,</i>
<i>why not stay home?</i>

20:50.791 --> 20:53.126
<i>Illicit venue for illicit acts, I suppose.</i>

20:54.127 --> 20:57.047
<i>Be prepared for a good old-fashioned</i>
<i>Hollywood den of sin.</i>

20:59.841 --> 21:00.717
<i>[Chloe] Hmm.</i>

21:01.635 --> 21:02.469
<i>Huh.</i>

21:02.636 --> 21:04.721
<i>Well, this place looks pretty tidy.</i>

21:04.805 --> 21:06.556
<i>Doesn't look like a drug den to me.</i>

21:06.640 --> 21:10.310
<i>I knew TV writing isn't all</i>
<i>hookers and blow like the '80s,</i>

21:11.061 --> 21:13.063
<i>but I had no idea how sad it had got.</i>

21:13.146 --> 21:15.148
<i>Over here? Number 18?</i>

21:15.649 --> 21:17.150
<i>Hold on, someone's in there.</i>

21:18.318 --> 21:20.404
<i>-Freeze! LAPD!</i>
<i>-Freeze! LAPD!</i>

21:20.487 --> 21:21.905
<i>-Drop the gun!</i>
<i>-Drop the gun!</i>

21:22.364 --> 21:25.826
<i>Wait. I'm a real cop with a real gun.</i>

21:25.909 --> 21:26.994
<i>That's a prop.</i>

21:27.494 --> 21:28.370
<i>Put it down.</i>

21:28.453 --> 21:30.414
<i>Sorry. Force of habit. [chuckles]</i>

21:30.497 --> 21:34.251
<i>Well, that little showdown will be fueling</i>
<i>my fantasies for the next few millennia.</i>

21:34.334 --> 21:36.753
<i>-[Diablo chuckles]</i>
<i>-What are you two doing here?</i>

21:36.837 --> 21:38.588
<i>Trying to solve the case, of course.</i>

21:38.797 --> 21:40.257
<i>We can do it on TV.</i>

21:40.340 --> 21:41.717
<i>Why not in real life?</i>

21:41.800 --> 21:45.012
<i>-Mm.</i>
<i>-How did you find out about this place?</i>

21:45.095 --> 21:46.221
<i>I found this...</i>

21:47.931 --> 21:49.099
<i>where Matt was killed.</i>

21:49.975 --> 21:51.184
<i>Fell out of his pocket.</i>

21:51.852 --> 21:55.022
<i>Just a little thing</i>
<i>I like to call "evidence."</i>

21:55.314 --> 21:57.190
<i>You stole evidence from the crime scene?</i>

21:57.274 --> 22:00.068
<i>To be fair, Detective,</i>
<i>that is absolutely on-brand.</i>

22:00.610 --> 22:02.195
<i>Well, this is really bringing it back.</i>

22:02.279 --> 22:05.532
<i>I'd almost forgotten how much fun</i>
<i>solving murders is. [chuckles]</i>

22:05.615 --> 22:07.367
<i>Uh, excuse me. [clears throat]</i>

22:08.618 --> 22:09.536
<i>Um...</i>

22:11.121 --> 22:12.664
<i>What are you doing with this idiot?</i>

22:14.249 --> 22:16.376
<i>[Dancer] Well, he was going to come</i>
<i>with or without me,</i>

22:16.460 --> 22:19.171
<i>and at least if I'm here,</i>
<i>I can keep him safe.</i>

22:19.755 --> 22:21.882
<i>I didn't realize you two were this close.</i>

22:22.215 --> 22:23.091
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

22:24.009 --> 22:27.679
<i>And if something does happen to him,</i>
<i>our show dies for real,</i>

22:28.138 --> 22:30.724
<i>and I cannot go through</i>
<i>another pilot season.</i>

22:32.476 --> 22:34.978
<i>I've just realized why this place</i>
<i>feels so familiar.</i>

22:35.062 --> 22:37.689
<i>This is where Matt was living</i>
<i>when I first met him.</i>

22:37.773 --> 22:41.526
<i>Matt mentioned he had a place he liked to</i>
<i>hide from the world when he was writing,</i>

22:41.610 --> 22:43.570
<i>where none of the execs could find him.</i>

22:43.904 --> 22:47.908
<i>Oh, so he didn't hole up here</i>
<i>to go on a drug binge.</i>

22:47.991 --> 22:50.994
<i>He came here to reconnect with a time</i>
<i>in his life where he felt control</i>

22:51.411 --> 22:52.245
<i>over his fate.</i>

22:52.329 --> 22:54.539
<i>Returning to the place where it all began.</i>

22:54.623 --> 22:55.874
<i>Yearning to find buzz--</i>

22:55.957 --> 22:56.958
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

22:57.042 --> 22:58.460
<i>Okay, you two, out, all right?</i>

22:58.543 --> 23:00.212
<i>I have to bag the whole place</i>
<i>for evidence,</i>

23:00.295 --> 23:01.797
<i>and you both are not cops.</i>

23:01.880 --> 23:03.632
<i>-So play time's over. Out!</i>
<i>-D--Don't...</i>

23:03.715 --> 23:06.385
<i>Don't take offense. She used to say</i>
<i>the exact same thing to me.</i>

23:06.468 --> 23:07.386
<i>[chuckles]</i>

23:10.347 --> 23:11.223
<i>And you, too.</i>

23:11.848 --> 23:12.724
<i>Out.</i>

23:13.058 --> 23:15.685
<i>Right, well, if that's what</i>
<i>you're telling me, Detective--</i>

23:15.769 --> 23:17.270
<i>I am, yes. I'm feeling a little...</i>

23:18.355 --> 23:20.357
<i>uh, overwhelmed by, </i>

23:20.440 --> 23:23.318
<i>um, well, </i>you <i>right now.</i>

23:26.696 --> 23:27.531
<i>Right.</i>

23:33.703 --> 23:34.579
<i>[Ella] </i>I don't get it.

23:34.955 --> 23:38.291
<i>Dude had a glamorous job, tons of money,</i>

23:38.375 --> 23:40.877
<i>and he ate Panda Express,</i>
<i>like, six times a week.</i>

23:41.920 --> 23:43.505
<i>People are who they are, I guess.</i>

23:43.922 --> 23:44.756
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:45.632 --> 23:48.093
<i>Do you believe in the idea</i>
<i>of predestination?</i>

23:48.176 --> 23:51.012
<i>Where you're forced to walk a path</i>
<i>that's already laid out for you?</i>

23:51.680 --> 23:52.514
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

23:52.597 --> 23:56.601
<i>My childhood and family background,</i>
<i>surrounded by criminals and dirt bags,</i>

23:56.685 --> 23:58.186
<i>I should've ended up in jail.</i>

23:58.937 --> 24:01.648
<i>But instead, I chose to get right</i>
<i>with the Big Guy,</i>

24:02.190 --> 24:04.651
<i>walk the straight and narrow,</i>
<i>and here I am,</i>

24:04.734 --> 24:07.863
<i>living proof that people can change</i>
<i>old, bad patterns.</i>

24:09.489 --> 24:10.490
<i>Hmm.</i>

24:11.241 --> 24:12.117
<i>You got a text.</i>

24:12.200 --> 24:13.118
<i>[Ella] Mm.</i>

24:13.201 --> 24:14.870
<i>Oh! Whoa, that's a penis.</i>

24:14.953 --> 24:16.288
<i>That's a tattooed penis.</i>

24:16.371 --> 24:18.165
<i>Some patterns are harder to change</i>
<i>than others.</i>

24:18.248 --> 24:20.792
<i>Wow... Uh, looks familiar.</i>

24:20.876 --> 24:21.835
<i>Wait, you know Craig?</i>

24:21.918 --> 24:22.752
<i>No, this.</i>

24:23.795 --> 24:27.174
<i>[sniffs] No, I don't know Craig</i>
<i>and his tattooed penis.</i>

24:36.641 --> 24:37.726
<i>Hey, pal.</i>

24:37.809 --> 24:39.769
<i>-Come on, man, that's my cup.</i>
<i>-Is it?</i>

24:40.854 --> 24:41.980
<i>Are you doing okay?</i>

24:42.063 --> 24:43.565
<i>Just fine, up until this very moment.</i>

24:43.648 --> 24:45.358
<i>I'm just listening to the detective.</i>

24:48.361 --> 24:50.071
<i>What, you're listening to her</i>
<i>from out here?</i>

24:50.447 --> 24:53.366
<i>Well, I'm certainly not listening to you,</i>
<i>so goodbye.</i>

24:53.450 --> 24:55.285
<i>-I know you're trying to push me away.</i>
<i>-[sighs]</i>

24:55.368 --> 24:56.578
<i>I brought curiosity in that,</i>

24:56.661 --> 24:58.830
<i>and I realized you're just</i>
<i>in a projective state,</i>

24:58.914 --> 25:01.500
<i>'cause you're feeling vulnerable</i>
<i>right now, and that's pretty scary.</i>

25:01.583 --> 25:02.542
<i>Oh.</i>

25:02.834 --> 25:04.085
<i>Detective Douche,</i>

25:04.169 --> 25:06.379
<i>if you want to see something really scary,</i>

25:06.463 --> 25:09.799
<i>wait until you see what your new all-soy</i>
<i>diet is doing to your bone density.</i>

25:09.883 --> 25:11.760
<i>You got a lot of ugly pictures</i>
<i>in your head, man.</i>

25:11.843 --> 25:13.637
<i>You need to work</i>
<i>on positive visualization.</i>

25:13.720 --> 25:15.847
<i>I made a lot of progress with that.</i>
<i>It can help you.</i>

25:19.017 --> 25:20.644
<i>Actually, maybe you can help me.</i>

25:21.603 --> 25:23.772
<i>This cosmic impotence,</i>

25:23.855 --> 25:27.234
<i>the knowledge that you're the plaything</i>
<i>of a cruel, uncaring God,</i>

25:27.317 --> 25:32.322
<i>the suffocating feeling that everything</i>
<i>you've ever accomplished is meaningless...</i>

25:33.281 --> 25:35.325
<i>You're the perfect person</i>
<i>to ask about these things.</i>

25:35.408 --> 25:36.785
<i>Tell me, when you were born...</i>

25:36.868 --> 25:37.702
<i>[Chloe] Hi.</i>

25:37.786 --> 25:40.205
<i>So, we have a new suspect</i>
<i>in Matt Owen's murder.</i>

25:41.706 --> 25:42.541
<i>[sniffs]</i>

25:43.166 --> 25:45.460
<i>A hot cinnamon vape cartridge?</i>

25:45.877 --> 25:48.463
<i>Really, Detective, no one is</i>
<i>more horrified by this than me,</i>

25:48.547 --> 25:50.465
<i>but it doesn't make Diablo our killer.</i>

25:50.549 --> 25:54.386
<i>No, but Diablo did say that</i>
<i>he hadn't been to that room before.</i>

25:54.469 --> 25:57.806
<i>Ella found this buried in two days</i>
<i>of Matt's trash, so why lie?</i>

25:59.849 --> 26:01.601
<i>That cheeky devil.</i>

26:02.394 --> 26:03.228
<i>Huh.</i>

26:03.812 --> 26:05.689
<i>I just don't get it, Detective.</i>

26:05.772 --> 26:08.942
<i>Why would an actor kill a man</i>
<i>who gave him the role of a lifetime?</i>

26:09.442 --> 26:10.277
<i>I don't know.</i>

26:10.360 --> 26:12.487
<i>Maybe he didn't like</i>
<i>being someone else's puppet?</i>

26:12.946 --> 26:13.822
<i>[Lucifer sighs]</i>

26:13.905 --> 26:16.741
<i>Sir, please, your scene was</i>
<i>supposed to start 40 minutes ago.</i>

26:19.911 --> 26:21.121
<i>Uh, stand aside, please.</i>

26:21.830 --> 26:22.706
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:31.172 --> 26:32.007
<i>Oh, man.</i>

26:43.643 --> 26:46.146
<i>How could nobody notice him missing</i>
<i>since lunch?</i>

26:46.229 --> 26:48.189
<i>I mean, this man is the entire show.</i>

26:48.273 --> 26:50.567
<i>None of these people would even exist</i>
<i>without him here.</i>

26:51.276 --> 26:52.819
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

26:53.153 --> 26:56.072
<i>Yep, everyone around is just here</i>
<i>to service you...</i>

26:56.156 --> 26:56.990
<i>I mean...</i>

26:57.073 --> 26:58.199
<i>[chuckles] Diablo.</i>

26:58.742 --> 26:59.576
<i>I mean Diablo.</i>

26:59.659 --> 27:03.121
<i>Anyhow, so, yes, he was stabbed, too,</i>
<i>hopefully with the same instrument.</i>

27:03.204 --> 27:04.789
<i>If we can find the murder weapon--</i>

27:04.873 --> 27:06.082
<i>Found the murder weapon!</i>

27:06.499 --> 27:09.085
<i>It's actually a prop from the show,</i>

27:09.169 --> 27:12.631
<i>supposed to be the only blade</i>
<i>that can kill the Devil.</i>

27:12.756 --> 27:14.883
<i>-[Lucifer chuckles]</i>
<i>-How ironic is that, right?</i>

27:14.966 --> 27:16.968
<i>-[laughs]</i>
<i>-Hi-ya!</i>

27:19.679 --> 27:21.890
<i>Sorry, that seemed</i>
<i>a lot funnier in my head.</i>

27:21.973 --> 27:23.808
<i>-I'm sure.</i>
<i>-Um... [chuckles]</i>

27:23.892 --> 27:25.644
<i>That's rubber.</i>
<i>It can't be the murder weapon.</i>

27:25.727 --> 27:27.729
<i>Uh, well, this is the stunt murder weapon.</i>

27:27.812 --> 27:30.940
<i>See, this is the rubber version</i>
<i>they use for action sequences.</i>

27:31.024 --> 27:34.611
<i>The one they use for close-ups</i>
<i>is sharp and metal, so...</i>

27:35.278 --> 27:37.447
<i>we find that one, we find our murderer.</i>

27:37.530 --> 27:38.490
<i>Huh.</i>

27:47.082 --> 27:48.166
<i>Blaze,</i>

27:48.249 --> 27:52.045
<i>tell the girls to swap their G-strings</i>
<i>for evening gowns tomorrow night.</i>

27:52.128 --> 27:53.046
<i>Wow.</i>

27:53.880 --> 27:55.507
<i>It's like looking into a mirror.</i>

27:57.550 --> 27:58.802
<i>Of course, my liege.</i>

28:00.345 --> 28:01.554
<i>Simpler times.</i>

28:02.722 --> 28:04.849
<i>Me and Lucifer, together,</i>

28:05.392 --> 28:07.102
<i>side by side for eons.</i>

28:08.144 --> 28:11.064
<i>...waste my demonic diesel</i>
<i>behind this bar.</i>

28:12.065 --> 28:13.858
<i>Now everyone just comes and goes.</i>

28:17.278 --> 28:18.113
<i>Okay.</i>

28:19.739 --> 28:21.950
<i>Maze, you know I'm not going anywhere...</i>

28:22.659 --> 28:23.493
<i>right?</i>

28:24.244 --> 28:25.704
<i>Maybe not on purpose, but...</i>

28:26.329 --> 28:28.581
<i>you're gonna drop dead in, what,</i>
<i>five years?</i>

28:30.125 --> 28:32.377
<i>How old do you think I am?</i>

28:33.461 --> 28:34.462
<i>I don't know, 30?</i>

28:35.004 --> 28:36.631
<i>[sighs deeply]</i>

28:37.590 --> 28:39.509
<i>Maze, you have nothing to worry about.</i>

28:40.218 --> 28:42.053
<i>I'm going to be around for a while.</i>

28:42.929 --> 28:44.472
<i>And then I'll be down in Hell,</i>

28:45.432 --> 28:48.935
<i>and I guess we can spend</i>
<i>the rest of eternity together, right?</i>

28:49.227 --> 28:50.395
<i>[chuckles]</i>

28:51.020 --> 28:51.855
<i>Sure, I guess.</i>

28:54.357 --> 28:55.358
<i>[clears throat]</i>

28:55.942 --> 28:59.279
<i>I think what you're struggling with</i>
<i>is a fear of abandonment.</i>

29:01.948 --> 29:03.324
<i>It's completely normal.</i>

29:04.868 --> 29:05.744
<i>It comes from...</i>

29:07.412 --> 29:10.331
<i>someone important to you</i>
<i>letting you down in your youth.</i>

29:10.707 --> 29:14.210
<i>I didn't have anyone important</i>
<i>in my youth, Linda.</i>

29:15.837 --> 29:16.838
<i>Just my blades.</i>

29:18.256 --> 29:19.883
<i>They have never let me down.</i>

29:20.717 --> 29:23.845
<i>It can cause a lot of anxiety</i>
<i>in intimate relationships.</i>

29:25.847 --> 29:27.724
<i>You know, but it's something</i>
<i>we can work on...</i>

29:27.807 --> 29:28.725
<i>Oh, my.</i>

29:28.808 --> 29:30.852
<i>...suffers most is the Devil himself.</i>

29:30.935 --> 29:32.562
<i>I suppose that's me.</i>

29:32.645 --> 29:35.315
<i>...back into Hell itself.</i>
<i>But until that day,</i>

29:35.398 --> 29:37.400
<i>I intend to enjoy the Earth.</i>

29:37.484 --> 29:40.653
<i>Come here, Doctor.</i>
<i>I'm ready for my treatment.</i>

29:45.283 --> 29:46.409
<i>This is gonna be good.</i>

29:46.493 --> 29:47.994
<i>Yeah, I'll have some of that.</i>

29:50.747 --> 29:51.664
<i>Great, thank you.</i>

29:52.207 --> 29:53.875
<i>[Lucifer] </i>
<i>This one would have been amazing.</i>

29:53.958 --> 29:56.377
<i>Diablo was going to solve a crime</i>
<i>in space.</i>

29:57.045 --> 29:58.046
<i>Oh. Mm-hmm.</i>

29:58.129 --> 30:00.882
<i>And what was Dancer doing,</i>
<i>a zero-G striptease?</i>

30:01.382 --> 30:02.509
<i>Have you read this already?</i>

30:04.761 --> 30:06.805
<i>[sighs] Look, Detective...</i>

30:08.097 --> 30:11.226
<i>I want you to know that I understand.</i>

30:11.518 --> 30:14.687
<i>I know how powerless I felt</i>
<i>when Mom told me the truth about you.</i>

30:14.771 --> 30:16.564
<i>That's right,</i>
<i>your mother told you the truth.</i>

30:16.648 --> 30:19.651
<i>Unlike my partner, who kept</i>
<i>a huge secret about my life from me.</i>

30:19.734 --> 30:23.112
<i>And now that you know,</i>
<i>it's hurt you, Detective,</i>

30:23.196 --> 30:25.573
<i>and, look, I want to fix things,</i>
<i>but you won't let me,</i>

30:25.657 --> 30:27.659
<i>-so what should I have done?</i>
<i>-Hey, guys?</i>

30:28.034 --> 30:30.745
<i>A PA was supposed to be sitting</i>
<i>at the door to Diablo's trailer,</i>

30:30.829 --> 30:33.206
<i>but she got called away</i>
<i>right around the time he was murdered.</i>

30:33.289 --> 30:36.042
<i>Great, so whoever called her away</i>
<i>could be the murderer. Who was it?</i>

30:36.125 --> 30:37.544
<i>Second AD called her away.</i>

30:37.627 --> 30:38.837
<i>Well, the second it is.</i>

30:38.920 --> 30:40.713
<i>But he got the message </i>
<i>from the first AD...</i>

30:40.797 --> 30:41.673
<i>The first.</i>

30:41.756 --> 30:43.091
<i>...who was passing on the message</i>

30:43.174 --> 30:45.134
<i>that the AD needed to be on set</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

30:45.218 --> 30:46.719
<i>For Dad's sake, who put in the request?</i>

30:46.803 --> 30:49.806
<i>More importantly, who was smart enough</i>
<i>to launder it through multiple people?</i>

30:49.889 --> 30:50.890
<i>Keri Belwood.</i>

30:51.641 --> 30:52.600
<i>The second on the show.</i>

30:54.686 --> 30:55.812
<i>Great.</i>

30:57.230 --> 30:59.440
<i>[woman] </i>Re-casting is not 
such a crazy idea.

30:59.524 --> 31:02.026
<i>He's the Devil, right?</i>
<i>He could change how he looks.</i>

31:02.110 --> 31:04.112
<i>We've got a good relationship</i>
<i>with Ice Cube,</i>

31:04.195 --> 31:05.989
<i>so maybe we could talk to his agent--</i>

31:06.072 --> 31:08.867
<i>Please tell me you're here</i>
<i>to put me out of my misery.</i>

31:08.950 --> 31:10.243
<i>Could be, yes.</i>

31:10.535 --> 31:12.954
<i>Why did you take the PA</i>
<i>off Diablo's trailer?</i>

31:13.037 --> 31:14.080
<i>I didn't.</i>

31:14.163 --> 31:16.666
<i>I've been on notes calls all day.</i>
<i>You can ask my assistant.</i>

31:16.749 --> 31:20.295
<i>The same assistant that provided</i>
<i>your alibi for Matt's brutal stabbing?</i>

31:20.920 --> 31:22.964
<i>Everyone knows you need</i>
<i>to pay your dues in Hollywood,</i>

31:23.047 --> 31:26.467
<i>but what kind of promotion do you get</i>
<i>for helping your boss beat murder charges?</i>

31:26.551 --> 31:29.804
<i>You knew exactly how to manipulate</i>
<i>the AD chain to get Diablo alone.</i>

31:30.179 --> 31:32.140
<i>You guys have got to be kidding me.</i>

31:32.223 --> 31:33.850
<i>-[scoffs]</i>
<i>-Why would I kill the star</i>

31:33.933 --> 31:35.476
<i>of what's suddenly my show?</i>

31:35.560 --> 31:37.395
<i>Look what I'm putting up with now.</i>

31:37.478 --> 31:39.105
<i>Hello, what's this?</i>

31:39.814 --> 31:42.358
<i>Research files for cases on the show.</i>

31:42.442 --> 31:44.402
<i>Excuse me, that's private.</i>

31:45.278 --> 31:46.112
<i>[Lucifer] Uh...</i>

31:46.446 --> 31:47.363
<i>Oh!</i>

31:48.531 --> 31:49.657
<i>[laughs]</i>

31:49.741 --> 31:53.202
<i>Well, it appears that someone's</i>
<i>been taking their research</i>

31:53.286 --> 31:54.662
<i>a little too seriously.</i>

31:55.163 --> 31:56.247
<i>That is not mine.</i>

31:56.748 --> 31:58.416
<i>-I didn't put that there.</i>
<i>-Really?</i>

31:58.499 --> 32:00.126
<i>Keri Belwood, you're under arrest.</i>

32:00.209 --> 32:01.836
<i>What, are you serious?</i>

32:01.920 --> 32:03.171
<i>This is ridiculous!</i>

32:03.630 --> 32:04.714
<i>[sighs]</i>

32:21.022 --> 32:23.441
<i>I'm trying to say this</i>
<i>from a constructive place.</i>

32:25.902 --> 32:28.988
<i>I can feel your negative vibrations</i>
<i>from across the room, man.</i>

32:29.822 --> 32:30.657
<i>Well...</i>

32:31.115 --> 32:33.701
<i>then you should probably move</i>
<i>even further away.</i>

32:33.785 --> 32:35.954
<i>I've just given the detective space</i>
<i>for the moment.</i>

32:36.037 --> 32:37.538
<i>You can give me space forever.</i>

32:39.165 --> 32:40.583
<i>It's just your pain talking.</i>

32:42.877 --> 32:47.256
<i>Do you know, of all the ways</i>
<i>you humans try to control your lives,</i>

32:47.340 --> 32:51.135
<i>these silly New Age superstitions</i>
<i>are by far the most embarrassing.</i>

32:51.219 --> 32:54.555
<i>I should be having a field day watching</i>
<i>you make a fool of yourself like this,</i>

32:54.639 --> 32:56.557
<i>but honestly, Daniel, it just...</i>

32:57.100 --> 32:58.559
<i>it just makes me sad.</i>

32:59.936 --> 33:00.812
<i>Okay.</i>

33:02.021 --> 33:03.064
<i>Is it all bullshit?</i>

33:05.024 --> 33:05.900
<i>I don't know.</i>

33:06.567 --> 33:07.402
<i>Maybe.</i>

33:08.695 --> 33:09.612
<i>Probably.</i>

33:11.155 --> 33:11.990
<i>I don't care.</i>

33:13.741 --> 33:15.952
<i>'Cause losing Charlotte made me realize...</i>

33:17.328 --> 33:19.497
<i>we have so little control over our lives.</i>

33:21.541 --> 33:23.501
<i>I was so pissed off about it for so long.</i>

33:23.584 --> 33:24.419
<i>But this...</i>

33:27.422 --> 33:29.048
<i>It keeps my mind positive,</i>

33:29.841 --> 33:30.800
<i>and it helps me.</i>

33:32.051 --> 33:34.345
<i>I need every win I can get, man.</i>
<i>We all do.</i>

33:35.555 --> 33:36.389
<i>Even you.</i>

33:39.809 --> 33:40.643
<i>Daniel...</i>

33:42.937 --> 33:46.691
<i>I am lowering my walls</i>
<i>and I'm willing to be reharmonized.</i>

33:46.816 --> 33:48.109
<i>I'll take the bracelet.</i>

33:50.486 --> 33:51.320
<i>Wait.</i>

33:51.404 --> 33:52.447
<i>[clears throat] Really?</i>

33:52.530 --> 33:53.740
<i>Oh, yes. Really.</i>

33:56.617 --> 33:57.493
<i>You sure?</i>

33:57.910 --> 33:58.995
<i>'Cause you need to want it.</i>

33:59.078 --> 34:01.581
<i>-Just give me the damn thing.</i>
<i>-You need to really want it.</i>

34:01.664 --> 34:03.666
<i>[laughs]</i>

34:08.421 --> 34:09.380
<i>What is this?</i>

34:09.881 --> 34:10.715
<i>Oh...</i>

34:10.798 --> 34:14.427
<i>Those are the personal notes</i>
<i>from the actor who played Diablo.</i>

34:14.510 --> 34:15.344
<i>[Dan] Hmm.</i>

34:15.428 --> 34:17.513
<i>He had a fascinating insight</i>
<i>into the character.</i>

34:18.014 --> 34:21.642
<i>Some wild theories about self-loathing,</i>
<i>but we can't get it all right.</i>

34:21.726 --> 34:22.769
<i>Oh, that is awful.</i>

34:22.852 --> 34:24.353
<i>"Diablo in Space"?</i>

34:24.437 --> 34:26.481
<i>Oh, truly a great episode.</i>

34:26.981 --> 34:27.815
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:28.232 --> 34:30.359
<i>It's such a pity</i>
<i>we'll never get to see it.</i>

34:38.701 --> 34:39.535
<i>[Dancer] Coming.</i>

34:41.871 --> 34:42.705
<i>Hi.</i>

34:43.331 --> 34:46.542
<i>I just thought you'd want to know</i>
<i>that we arrested Keri for the murders.</i>

34:46.626 --> 34:48.002
<i>I wanted to tell you in person.</i>

34:48.086 --> 34:49.128
<i>[sighs]</i>

34:50.880 --> 34:52.173
<i>Thank you, Detective.</i>

34:52.715 --> 34:54.634
<i>I wish I could say I was surprised, but...</i>

34:55.301 --> 34:57.345
<i>Keri never stopped bitching about Matt.</i>

34:58.596 --> 34:59.972
<i>"He cut all my jokes.</i>

35:00.056 --> 35:01.140
<i>He was a hack.</i>

35:01.224 --> 35:03.726
<i>He only let us order Tender Greens</i>
<i>for lunch."</i>

35:03.810 --> 35:05.937
<i>[chuckles] That's actually pretty dead-on.</i>

35:06.020 --> 35:06.979
<i>[Dancer chuckles]</i>

35:07.522 --> 35:10.733
<i>Yeah, I just wish I had more motive</i>
<i>why she would want to kill your co-star.</i>

35:10.817 --> 35:13.820
<i>Well, maybe he actually figured it out</i>
<i>that she did it.</i>

35:13.945 --> 35:14.862
<i>I mean...</i>

35:15.446 --> 35:17.198
<i>He wasn't the brightest bulb, but...</i>

35:18.324 --> 35:19.951
<i>he was surprisingly insightful.</i>

35:21.202 --> 35:23.079
<i>You two were close. I'm sorry.</i>

35:24.247 --> 35:27.250
<i>The thing is, when you're stuck</i>
<i>with someone in a situation</i>

35:27.333 --> 35:29.669
<i>you have absolutely no control over...</i>

35:30.753 --> 35:33.005
<i>I know it sounds silly to a real cop...</i>

35:34.298 --> 35:35.842
<i>but we were partners.</i>

35:36.509 --> 35:38.594
<i>No, it... It doesn't sound silly.</i>

35:39.470 --> 35:41.597
<i>You know, I know</i>
<i>exactly what you're talking about.</i>

35:42.932 --> 35:46.060
<i>"I can't believe</i>
<i>you pulled it off, Diablo.</i>

35:46.144 --> 35:49.981
<i>We made it back to Earth piloting</i>
<i>a hijacked space shuttle. Insane!"</i>

35:51.274 --> 35:53.651
<i>"You can say that again, Dancer.</i>

35:53.734 --> 35:54.986
<i>A devil in the heavens.</i>

35:55.611 --> 35:57.572
<i>But crime, it must be punished."</i>

35:57.822 --> 36:01.284
<i>Daniel, the original actor playing Diablo</i>
<i>is dead, not you.</i>

36:01.367 --> 36:02.994
<i>Please, can we just give it a bit of life?</i>

36:03.077 --> 36:05.329
<i>Just set me up for the next line, okay?</i>

36:05.413 --> 36:07.331
<i>Big smile, just have fun with it.</i>

36:07.415 --> 36:10.084
<i>-[Dan clears throat] </i>
<i>-"Another case closed, Diablo.</i>

36:10.418 --> 36:11.586
<i>So does that mean I can...</i>

36:12.420 --> 36:13.963
<i>put my bra back on?"</i>

36:14.380 --> 36:16.299
<i>Oof. Well, it's not Shakespeare, is it?</i>

36:16.382 --> 36:17.592
<i>Oh, what's going on here?</i>

36:18.426 --> 36:19.969
<i>You guys are acting out </i>Diablo<i> episodes</i>

36:20.052 --> 36:21.304
<i>-without me?</i>
<i>-Well, we're trying.</i>

36:21.387 --> 36:24.515
<i>"Don't tell him the Devil made you do it."</i>

36:25.391 --> 36:26.893
<i>-Huh?</i>
<i>-We won't.</i>

36:26.976 --> 36:27.852
<i>Damn.</i>

36:28.227 --> 36:30.605
<i>Lucifer, you did so much prep</i>
<i>on your character.</i>

36:30.688 --> 36:32.690
<i>I suppose I'm not surprised, though.</i>

36:32.773 --> 36:35.067
<i>No, these are Diablo's notes. Here.</i>

36:35.151 --> 36:36.944
<i>Previously they'd all been</i>
<i>about the character,</i>

36:37.028 --> 36:39.113
<i>but these new ones are just gibberish.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

36:39.488 --> 36:42.950
<i>"Yearning equals freedom."</i>
<i>"Weapon equals Baphomet's blade."</i>

36:43.034 --> 36:43.951
<i>[Ella] Yearning?</i>

36:45.244 --> 36:47.288
<i>I knew the man was a genius.</i>

36:49.165 --> 36:51.792
<i>These are Diablo's notes on the case!</i>

36:52.460 --> 36:55.129
<i>He was investigating Matt Owen's murder</i>
<i>as well, and look.</i>

36:55.213 --> 36:57.215
<i>"Killer equals number two."</i>

36:57.548 --> 36:58.966
<i>Keri was the show's number two.</i>

36:59.050 --> 37:01.594
<i>I can't believe it,</i>
<i>but he actually solved it!</i>

37:02.094 --> 37:04.555
<i>Oh, Diablo,</i>
<i>is there anything you can't do?</i>

37:04.764 --> 37:06.807
<i>But didn't Keri kill Matt to take his job?</i>

37:07.600 --> 37:09.518
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>freedom was the yearning, man.</i>

37:09.602 --> 37:11.395
<i>Yeah, I don't think</i>
<i>Keri killed him at all.</i>

37:11.479 --> 37:13.064
<i>Based on the stab wounds,</i>

37:13.147 --> 37:16.734
<i>I was able to confirm that the victims</i>
<i>were killed by someone right-handed,</i>

37:16.817 --> 37:19.362
<i>and Keri has repetitive stress injuries</i>
<i>in her wrists.</i>

37:19.445 --> 37:20.988
<i>I mean, it'd be highly unlikely</i>

37:21.072 --> 37:24.116
<i>that she could stab someone</i>
<i>with the force that made those wounds,</i>

37:24.200 --> 37:25.910
<i>especially with her non-dominant hand.</i>

37:25.993 --> 37:28.162
<i>Well, it says it right here</i>
<i>in black and white.</i>

37:28.246 --> 37:30.206
<i>Diablo was certain</i>
<i>the killer was number two.</i>

37:30.831 --> 37:32.291
<i>Unless he meant someone else.</i>

37:34.752 --> 37:37.296
<i>So, this is Diablo's club.</i>

37:37.797 --> 37:38.631
<i>Hades,</i>

37:39.090 --> 37:41.175
<i>where Christie Dancer was a stripper</i>

37:41.259 --> 37:44.470
<i>before she joined the police force</i>
<i>to solve her father's murder.</i>

37:44.804 --> 37:49.517
<i>Don't worry, one of these bottles,</i>
<i>there is actual booze in it.</i>

37:49.934 --> 37:53.938
<i>A little secret from the scenes where</i>
<i>Detective Dancer has to get a confession</i>

37:54.647 --> 37:56.148
<i>with a lap dance.</i>

37:56.315 --> 37:57.441
<i>[chuckles ironically]</i>

38:00.236 --> 38:01.654
<i>-Oh, thank you.</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

38:01.737 --> 38:02.697
<i>Cheers.</i>

38:04.865 --> 38:05.783
<i>[Dancer grunts]</i>

38:06.867 --> 38:08.953
<i>-[coughs]</i>
<i>-So how do you do it?</i>

38:10.079 --> 38:12.415
<i>No, no, no. I mean,</i>
<i>the way they write your character.</i>

38:13.124 --> 38:15.668
<i>I mean, she only exists to serve Diablo.</i>

38:15.751 --> 38:19.880
<i>So what's the secret to getting up every</i>
<i>day knowing everything you do and say is</i>

38:20.214 --> 38:22.091
<i>only servicing another person?</i>

38:22.675 --> 38:24.176
<i>Do you think there's a secret?</i>

38:24.635 --> 38:26.721
<i>It's literally hell on Earth.</i>

38:26.804 --> 38:29.390
<i>Saying those lines,</i>
<i>wearing those clothes...</i>

38:29.932 --> 38:31.434
<i>Thank God it's over.</i>

38:31.517 --> 38:33.561
<i>Now I can really push myself.</i>

38:34.270 --> 38:35.438
<i>Okay, there's this film.</i>

38:35.521 --> 38:38.065
<i>It's a tiny indie,</i>
<i>but the part is so great.</i>

38:38.149 --> 38:40.401
<i>It's this woman coming back</i>
<i>from Afghanistan,</i>

38:40.484 --> 38:42.445
<i>dealing with her mother's Alzheimer's.</i>

38:42.528 --> 38:44.030
<i>Now that I'm free, I can take the part,</i>

38:44.113 --> 38:46.073
<i>and the director's so collaborative.</i>

38:47.033 --> 38:47.992
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

38:48.534 --> 38:49.368
<i>I'm rambling.</i>

38:50.870 --> 38:51.704
<i>No.</i>

38:52.163 --> 38:53.164
<i>No, it's just, um...</i>

38:53.247 --> 38:55.791
<i>You said this was an amazing gig</i>

38:55.875 --> 38:57.918
<i>and that you were grateful to have it.</i>

38:58.794 --> 39:00.171
<i>That's true.</i>

39:00.254 --> 39:03.299
<i>I was, but you gotta move on. [sputtering]</i>

39:03.424 --> 39:06.802
<i>When a gig ends, sometimes it's easier</i>
<i>to focus on the bad.</i>

39:07.219 --> 39:09.096
<i>It's actor stuff. We're crazy.</i>

39:09.180 --> 39:10.681
<i>Yeah, yeah. I totally get it.</i>

39:10.765 --> 39:14.060
<i>And now you can showcase your talent</i>
<i>on a show that lets you.</i>

39:14.143 --> 39:16.437
<i>Well, for example,</i>
<i>the impression you did of Keri.</i>

39:16.520 --> 39:19.523
<i>I mean, that was really... really good.</i>
<i>Dead-on.</i>

39:20.232 --> 39:21.817
<i>-You think so?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

39:22.109 --> 39:24.528
<i>Yeah, in fact, it would be</i>
<i>nearly impossible</i>

39:24.612 --> 39:26.697
<i>to tell you two apart over the phone.</i>

39:35.122 --> 39:36.374
<i>[panting] Wait.</i>

39:36.457 --> 39:37.333
<i>Okay.</i>

39:37.792 --> 39:41.712
<i>I understand killing your showrunner</i>
<i>for holding you back,</i>

39:41.796 --> 39:47.385
<i>and I get you hiding the vape cartridge</i>
<i>to frame your co-star, but why...</i>

39:48.344 --> 39:51.347
<i>would you kill him when you wanted us</i>
<i>to think he was the murderer?</i>

39:51.931 --> 39:55.476
<i>Because that idiot "deduced my yearning"</i>

39:55.559 --> 39:57.603
<i>and figured out what I did!</i>

39:57.686 --> 40:00.564
<i>He was honestly sweet, in a dopey way,</i>

40:00.648 --> 40:04.819
<i>but I wasn't gonna let him take away</i>
<i>the freedom I almost got myself.</i>

40:04.902 --> 40:10.241
<i>I am not spending the next six seasons</i>
<i>with my main prop as a stripper pole!</i>

40:12.410 --> 40:13.661
<i>[Dancer grunts]</i>

40:13.994 --> 40:15.204
<i>[groans]</i>

40:19.083 --> 40:21.001
<i>So, Diablo was right.</i>

40:21.585 --> 40:23.045
<i>The killer was number two,</i>

40:23.129 --> 40:24.797
<i>on the actors' call sheet.</i>

40:24.880 --> 40:26.340
<i>How long have you been here?</i>

40:27.007 --> 40:30.136
<i>Long enough to realize you have this</i>
<i>totally handled on your own.</i>

40:30.553 --> 40:34.223
<i>As much as I appreciate the effort,</i>
<i>I think I prefer my own club,</i>

40:34.306 --> 40:37.435
<i>and I definitely prefer the way</i>
<i>my father made you, Detective.</i>

40:39.061 --> 40:41.105
<i>Though I'm sure your tips</i>
<i>would have been great.</i>

40:41.605 --> 40:42.606
<i>[chuckles]</i>

40:43.524 --> 40:45.025
<i>That wasn't the right joke, was it?</i>

40:45.860 --> 40:47.987
<i>I'm just not finding</i>
<i>the right thing to say.</i>

40:48.070 --> 40:49.321
<i>I'm sorry, Detective.</i>

40:49.697 --> 40:52.116
<i>I wish you'd just tell me what to do.</i>

40:53.659 --> 40:54.618
<i>I...</i>

40:54.702 --> 40:55.536
<i>[scoffs]</i>

40:55.744 --> 40:58.622
<i>I don't know if there is anything</i>
<i>for you to do. I...</i>

40:59.039 --> 41:02.877
<i>I thought that I had found someone</i>
<i>who had the answer,</i>

41:03.419 --> 41:05.963
<i>someone who knew how it felt, someone...</i>

41:07.131 --> 41:09.508
<i>who could help me cope with feeling...</i>

41:10.468 --> 41:11.719
<i>so powerless.</i>

41:13.846 --> 41:15.264
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

41:29.069 --> 41:31.155
<i>[both laughing]</i>

41:32.823 --> 41:38.787
<i>You have mentioned a few times now</i>
<i>that you are worried about going to Hell.</i>

41:40.539 --> 41:41.624
<i>What's the problem?</i>

41:41.707 --> 41:43.042
<i>I literally grew up there.</i>

41:43.125 --> 41:44.418
<i>I, I turned out fine.</i>

41:44.502 --> 41:45.586
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:46.003 --> 41:47.129
<i>I mean, you're right.</i>

41:47.546 --> 41:49.131
<i>You're right. I don't...</i>

41:49.840 --> 41:52.843
<i>It's just some stupid thing humans say.</i>

41:53.344 --> 41:54.178
<i>Mm.</i>

41:54.261 --> 41:56.388
<i>But I want to know about you, though.</i>

41:56.889 --> 41:57.890
<i>Your...</i>

41:58.891 --> 42:00.809
<i>abandonment issues.</i>

42:01.977 --> 42:03.312
<i>[scoffs] I wouldn't...</i>

42:04.438 --> 42:06.357
<i>call them abandonment issues.</i>

42:07.024 --> 42:08.526
<i>They're not issues.</i>

42:08.943 --> 42:11.153
<i>I mean, who cares</i>
<i>if Lucifer left me, right?</i>

42:11.570 --> 42:12.446
<i>[scoffs]</i>

42:12.780 --> 42:13.864
<i>Chloe left me.</i>

42:15.157 --> 42:16.200
<i>[sighs]</i>

42:22.289 --> 42:24.333
<i>[sobs] Then she left me.</i>

42:28.128 --> 42:29.255
<i>Why did she leave me?</i>

42:30.881 --> 42:31.715
<i>Eve?</i>

42:34.718 --> 42:36.011
<i>[sobbing]</i>

42:45.312 --> 42:46.772
<i>Ugh! [grunts]</i>

42:50.484 --> 42:51.527
<i>[elevator dings]</i>

43:01.704 --> 43:03.205
<i>[whooshing sound]</i>

43:07.501 --> 43:08.419
<i>Huh.</i>

43:08.627 --> 43:11.922
<i>I was wondering when you'd show</i>
<i>our face again...</i>

43:17.052 --> 43:17.886
<i>brother.</i>

43:24.935 --> 43:26.145
<i>Welcome home.</i>

43:29.148 --> 43:29.982
<i>So...</i>

43:30.733 --> 43:33.360
<i>how do you like the mess I made, Samael?</i>

43:33.736 --> 43:34.612
<i>[scoffs]</i>

43:36.238 --> 43:38.324
<i>Trying to get under my skin, brother?</i>

43:38.407 --> 43:41.702
<i>Well, I hoped turning your life</i>
<i>upside down would do that, but...</i>

43:42.202 --> 43:45.080
<i>if all it takes is a name,</i>
<i>maybe I overestimated you.</i>

43:46.582 --> 43:48.667
<i>Wondering why I'm doing all of this?</i>

43:48.751 --> 43:49.877
<i>Not particularly.</i>

43:50.586 --> 43:53.672
<i>Oh, right, you're so above it. I forgot.</i>

43:53.756 --> 43:55.549
<i>If we could all be as cool as you.</i>

43:56.050 --> 43:58.636
<i>Well, isn't that what this is about,</i>
<i>Michael? Hmm?</i>

43:59.011 --> 44:03.474
<i>It's funny how turning my life upside down</i>
<i>actually involved pretending to be me.</i>

44:03.557 --> 44:04.725
<i>It worked, didn't it?</i>

44:04.808 --> 44:07.227
<i>It's the only trick you ever pulled.</i>

44:07.311 --> 44:09.104
<i>All our lives you wanted everyone to think</i>

44:09.188 --> 44:11.774
<i>that you were the cleverer one,</i>
<i>the big brain, but...</i>

44:12.816 --> 44:14.652
<i>it's only ever been about me,</i>

44:14.735 --> 44:16.779
<i>about trying to be me.</i>

44:17.112 --> 44:19.490
<i>[chuckles] You always thought too small.</i>

44:20.199 --> 44:22.201
<i>Not like you, right?</i>

44:22.910 --> 44:24.244
<i>Lucifer the rebel,</i>

44:24.328 --> 44:27.081
<i>deciding you can do a better job than Dad?</i>

44:30.042 --> 44:30.876
<i>You know,</i>

44:31.543 --> 44:35.798
<i>I wonder how you got</i>
<i>that idea in your head</i>

44:36.340 --> 44:37.341
<i>in the first place.</i>

44:37.758 --> 44:41.679
<i>[laughs] Right, that's your play, is it?</i>

44:41.762 --> 44:43.681
<i>Taking credit for my failed rebellion?</i>

44:43.764 --> 44:45.641
<i>By all means, it's yours.</i>

44:45.724 --> 44:47.351
<i>Now, you see, that is the best part.</i>

44:48.352 --> 44:50.270
<i>All I did was plant the idea.</i>

44:51.230 --> 44:53.107
<i>You're the one who chose do it.</i>

44:53.190 --> 44:57.194
<i>You still get to keep</i>
<i>all the blame yourself.</i>

44:57.444 --> 44:58.612
<i>[chuckles]</i>

44:59.697 --> 45:00.656
<i>[scoffs]</i>

45:01.240 --> 45:03.617
<i>Your lies are so tedious, Michael.</i>

45:03.701 --> 45:06.245
<i>Not as tedious as your denial.</i>

45:08.247 --> 45:10.040
<i>'Cause I'm not lying now, brother,</i>

45:10.124 --> 45:13.210
<i>and I think, deep down,</i>
<i>you are realizing that.</i>

45:14.586 --> 45:17.005
<i>And once you realize that...</i>

45:17.923 --> 45:18.924
<i>you're gonna wonder...</i>

45:20.217 --> 45:23.512
<i>maybe it wasn't just the rebellion</i>
<i>that was my suggestion.</i>

45:24.638 --> 45:25.597
<i>What else?</i>

45:26.765 --> 45:30.644
<i>What about your little sexcapade</i>
<i>in the garden, or...</i>

45:31.228 --> 45:32.146
<i>Oh...</i>

45:32.646 --> 45:34.398
<i>your vacation here to Earth.</i>

45:36.150 --> 45:37.484
<i>That's impossible.</i>

45:37.568 --> 45:38.527
<i>Mm-mm.</i>

45:38.652 --> 45:40.320
<i>It was quite easy, actually.</i>

45:40.696 --> 45:42.322
<i>All it took was a little whisper here,</i>

45:42.406 --> 45:44.491
<i>a carefully orchestrated</i>
<i>coincidence there,</i>

45:44.575 --> 45:47.119
<i>and your pathological self-absorption,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

45:47.202 --> 45:48.120
<i>Voilà!</i>

45:49.121 --> 45:50.497
<i>All your idea.</i>

45:53.208 --> 45:54.042
<i>Why?</i>

45:54.626 --> 45:58.922
<i>Because all our lives,</i>
<i>you thought that you were better than me.</i>

46:00.966 --> 46:05.554
<i>The great Lucifer Morningstar,</i>
<i>but you're not, are you?</i>

46:06.638 --> 46:08.640
<i>You're just Samael.</i>

46:09.099 --> 46:11.769
<i>Stop calling me that.</i>

46:11.852 --> 46:12.686
<i>All right.</i>

46:13.645 --> 46:16.148
<i>Why don't I call you</i>
<i>what you know you really are?</i>

46:17.858 --> 46:18.776
<i>Unworthy.</i>

46:23.447 --> 46:24.323
<i>[Lucifer roars]</i>

46:34.500 --> 46:35.459
<i>[Lucifer screams]</i>

46:42.132 --> 46:43.509

46:46.178 --> 46:47.429
<i>[Michael muttering]</i>

46:48.597 --> 46:50.182
<i>[screams in pain]</i>

47:01.985 --> 47:02.945
<i>[Michael choking]</i>

47:27.261 --> 47:28.637
<i>[Lucifer panting]</i>

47:31.640 --> 47:33.642
<i>[both panting]</i>

<i>[Michael groaning]</i>

48:00.460 --> 48:03.255
<i>You may want credit</i>
<i>for my decisions, but...</i>

48:04.631 --> 48:05.924
<i>[panting]</i>

48:06.717 --> 48:10.679
<i>...I'm confident this one is all mine.</i>

48:10.846 --> 48:12.848
<i>-[Lucifer laughs]</i>
<i>-[Michael screams]</i>

48:22.691 --> 48:23.525
<i>Lucifer.</i>

48:24.818 --> 48:25.652
<i>You okay?</i>

48:26.820 --> 48:28.071
<i>You look like hell.</i>

48:29.406 --> 48:30.365
<i>Appropriate.</i>

48:31.617 --> 48:32.576
<i>Um...</i>

48:33.452 --> 48:34.745
<i>So, uh...</i>

48:35.454 --> 48:36.955
<i>the good news is,</i>

48:37.539 --> 48:39.666
<i>I dealt with the Michael problem.</i>

48:40.626 --> 48:42.878
<i>He won't be impersonating me ever again.</i>

48:43.545 --> 48:47.090
<i>The bad news is that I've discovered...</i>

48:47.966 --> 48:53.764
<i>apparently, he's been manipulating me</i>
<i>since the dawn of time.</i>

48:55.974 --> 48:56.808
<i>Oh.</i>

48:59.019 --> 49:00.228
<i>Yeah, must be, um...</i>

49:01.229 --> 49:02.105
<i>terrible to...</i>

49:03.231 --> 49:04.608
<i>not control your own fate.</i>

49:04.691 --> 49:06.944
<i>All right. I get it, Detective.</i>

49:07.027 --> 49:09.321
<i>You're struggling with</i>
<i>feeling like you can't cope.</i>

49:09.404 --> 49:11.448
<i>Well, welcome to the bloody club!</i>

49:12.199 --> 49:13.867
<i>You have no right to yell at me.</i>

49:14.701 --> 49:16.745
<i>Our situations are nothing alike.</i>

49:16.828 --> 49:18.121
<i>You are an angel.</i>

49:18.205 --> 49:21.917
<i>You deal with celestial craziness </i>
<i>all the time.</i>

49:22.000 --> 49:23.835
<i>I am just a person, Lucifer.</i>

49:25.128 --> 49:26.213
<i>Just a person</i>

49:26.296 --> 49:29.967
<i>who was already dealing with the fact</i>
<i>that I'm in love with the Devil,</i>

49:30.050 --> 49:31.385
<i>and then...</i>

49:32.219 --> 49:34.680
<i>I find out that I was made...</i>

49:36.223 --> 49:37.099
<i>to feel that way.</i>

49:40.018 --> 49:41.812
<i>That my life isn't my own,</i>

49:41.895 --> 49:45.565
<i>so I am sorry if your brother is</i>
<i>a jerk to you sometimes.</i>

49:47.150 --> 49:48.110
<i>[sighs deeply]</i>

49:52.781 --> 49:53.615
<i>I... I...</i>

49:54.241 --> 49:59.913
<i>I spent thousands of years in Hell,</i>
<i>imagining our reunion.</i>

50:01.456 --> 50:03.208
<i>Getting my partner back, getting...</i>

50:05.293 --> 50:07.754
<i>Getting you back. And now...</i>

50:10.674 --> 50:11.508
<i>I...</i>

50:14.803 --> 50:17.723
<i>I just thought it would go differently.</i>

50:21.143 --> 50:22.477
<i>Yeah. [sniffles]</i>

50:23.854 --> 50:24.688
<i>Me, too.</i>

50:27.482 --> 50:29.276
<i>I thought what we had was real.</i>

50:32.612 --> 50:33.447
<i>[scoffs]</i>

50:54.217 --> 50:56.261
<i>Decker! You home?</i>

50:57.763 --> 50:59.598
<i>Come on, it's 9:30.</i>

51:00.182 --> 51:01.850
<i>Even you can't be in bed.</i>

51:01.933 --> 51:02.934
<i>[man] She's not here.</i>

51:04.644 --> 51:06.563
<i>She left quite abruptly, actually.</i>

51:06.855 --> 51:08.106
<i>She was quite upset.</i>

51:09.232 --> 51:10.150
<i>Oh.</i>

51:11.610 --> 51:14.488
<i>I suppose you're the person</i>
<i>I wanted to talk to, anyway.</i>

51:16.281 --> 51:17.824
<i>I wanted to say that...</i>

51:20.160 --> 51:21.203
<i>that I'm sorry.</i>

51:22.454 --> 51:23.955
<i>I shouldn't have tried to stab you.</i>

51:25.082 --> 51:28.376
<i>Turns out you weren't the one</i>
<i>I was upset with to begin with.</i>

51:28.960 --> 51:29.836
<i>Really?</i>

51:30.545 --> 51:32.047
<i>You're not upset with Lucifer?</i>

51:36.009 --> 51:36.885
<i>Well...</i>

51:37.761 --> 51:38.845
<i>you should be.</i>

51:44.017 --> 51:46.436
<i>Well, this night turned out</i>
<i>better than expected.</i>

51:47.062 --> 51:49.064
<i>Now I get to cut out your lying tongue.</i>

51:50.190 --> 51:52.359
<i>You were right. You were right.</i>

51:52.734 --> 51:56.613
<i>I'm a liar, and Lucifer always</i>
<i>tells the truth, doesn't he?</i>

51:57.697 --> 52:00.534
<i>Oh, yeah, except for when</i>
<i>he leaves things out.</i>

52:00.867 --> 52:03.870
<i>Like the secret that he kept from Chloe,</i>

52:04.621 --> 52:07.082
<i>and the one that he's keeping from you.</i>

52:11.419 --> 52:12.754
<i>What secret?</i>

52:12.838 --> 52:13.672
<i>Mm-mm.</i>

52:13.755 --> 52:14.673
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

52:15.132 --> 52:16.508
<i>I can't tell you that.</i>

52:17.551 --> 52:18.718
<i>You won't believe me...</i>

52:19.636 --> 52:21.304
<i>'cause I'm a liar, right?</i>

52:24.266 --> 52:25.100
<i>But...</i>

52:26.560 --> 52:29.855
<i>I can tell you how to find it out</i>
<i>for yourself.</i>
