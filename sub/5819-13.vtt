WEBVTT

00:01.279 --> 00:02.764
<i>Previously on </i> The Originals...

00:02.794 --> 00:05.099
Freya: If this prophecy is fulfilled,

00:05.129 --> 00:06.428
you will all fall,

00:06.430 --> 00:08.437
<i>one by friend, one by foe,</i>

00:08.467 --> 00:10.599
and one by a family.

00:10.601 --> 00:11.884
I challenge you to a dual.

00:11.914 --> 00:13.153
<i>Whomever holds the charter</i>

00:13.183 --> 00:16.100
<i>at the stroke of midnight shall
be the new leader of the Strix.</i>

00:16.129 --> 00:18.474
Catch me. If not, I'm in charge.

00:18.476 --> 00:19.845
Marcel has won.

00:19.875 --> 00:21.537
<i>You're the new leader of the Strix.</i>

00:21.567 --> 00:23.425
So the Strix have their
own personal coven?

00:23.455 --> 00:25.152
I'll make certain you're
granted the power

00:25.182 --> 00:26.682
to bring back your precious Kol.

00:26.684 --> 00:28.934
In exchange, you will
become one of my sisters

00:28.936 --> 00:31.333
and find the weapon that
can kill an Original.

00:31.363 --> 00:33.439
With the right witches,
the correct spell,

00:33.441 --> 00:36.025
the precise binding agent,
there is a means

00:36.027 --> 00:37.743
to eradicate our link to our sires.

00:37.745 --> 00:41.035
Davina is obstinate, but
she will listen to you.

00:41.065 --> 00:43.565
You know what I've come for.
Hand it over.

00:43.567 --> 00:46.118
(Screaming)

00:48.161 --> 00:50.122
Klaus: With the weapon
in the Aurora's hands...

00:50.124 --> 00:52.087
I wonder which one of us
she'll kill first.

00:52.694 --> 00:55.077
What animal do you aim to hunt
with bullets made of wood?

00:55.079 --> 00:56.770
A monster.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.664
An entire family of them.

01:03.062 --> 01:06.641
(Indistinct conversations)

01:06.671 --> 01:08.495
Klaus: The tax payers of New Orleans

01:08.525 --> 01:11.226
deserve a skilled chief of police.

01:11.380 --> 01:14.062
How inept are you if not
a single one of your men

01:14.064 --> 01:15.731
can locate the woman I seek.

01:16.264 --> 01:17.616
We're trying.

01:17.646 --> 01:19.044
She's a ghost.

01:19.074 --> 01:21.787
Aurora de Martel is rather
petite and may indeed be able

01:21.817 --> 01:24.712
to slip through the cracks
like a wicked little cricket,

01:24.742 --> 01:26.547
but she is not a ghost.

01:26.577 --> 01:28.178
Not yet.

01:28.870 --> 01:31.513
I think this city's finest

01:31.543 --> 01:33.704
could try a bit harder, hmm?

01:33.734 --> 01:35.100
Freya: I see we're in for another

01:35.102 --> 01:37.149
normal Mikaelson breakfast.

01:37.179 --> 01:40.409
Niklaus, for heaven's sakes,
release the poor creature.

01:40.701 --> 01:41.702
No!

01:42.793 --> 01:43.911
(Groaning)

01:43.941 --> 01:45.112
That's not what I meant.

01:45.142 --> 01:48.197
He'll live, and he'll
remember to do better.

01:48.199 --> 01:50.616
Is all this torture necessary?

01:50.618 --> 01:53.118
Where have you been?

01:53.812 --> 01:55.370
I was making sure that the Strix

01:55.400 --> 01:58.123
and their witches are out trying
to find your loony ex-girlfriend.

01:58.125 --> 01:59.791
- Is that okay by you?
- Gentlemen, please.

01:59.793 --> 02:01.415
Marcel: All of our heads
are on the chopping block

02:01.445 --> 02:02.983
because he lost the one thing

02:03.013 --> 02:03.971
that can kill an Original.

02:04.001 --> 02:06.471
It's not his fault that Cami
is waving the white oak around

02:06.501 --> 02:09.745
like a kite, or that Aurora made
a deal with one of your witches.

02:09.775 --> 02:10.769
- Oh, yeah, it is.
- I am quite

02:10.770 --> 02:13.322
capable of defending
myself, thank you, Freya.

02:13.604 --> 02:16.866
What I cannot do is cast
a spell to find Aurora.

02:16.896 --> 02:19.444
In that respect, we're alike.

02:19.446 --> 02:20.896
Aurora is cloaked,

02:20.898 --> 02:23.114
most likely by the
very witch she killed.

02:23.116 --> 02:24.983
I have been working
non-stop every day...

02:24.985 --> 02:26.321
Well, you've stopped now.

02:26.351 --> 02:27.739
Haven't you?

02:29.389 --> 02:32.240
Well, go on. On your way.

02:33.566 --> 02:35.744
Do you talk to our
other sister like this?

02:37.505 --> 02:39.260
Didn't think so.

02:42.067 --> 02:43.326
Freya?

02:45.456 --> 02:47.423
What do we know about this
traitor in the Strix coven?

02:47.453 --> 02:48.457
Marcel: Nothing.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.125
No one knows how Aurora got to her.

02:50.127 --> 02:52.346
No one knows where Aurora is.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.564
Our coven hit the same
cloaking spell as Freya.

02:54.594 --> 02:56.070
Your coven?

02:56.100 --> 02:58.675
Making yourself quite comfortable
with the Strix, aren't you?

02:58.705 --> 02:59.807
Yeah, yeah.

02:59.837 --> 03:01.262
To help you.

03:03.528 --> 03:04.831
Any other news

03:04.861 --> 03:08.594
from your new BFFs you'd
like to make us aware of?

03:09.947 --> 03:12.294
Niklaus, why don't we reserve any

03:12.324 --> 03:15.117
malevolent intentions
for ex-girlfriends?

03:19.137 --> 03:23.625
(Horns playing dixieland jazz)

03:27.637 --> 03:30.644
Let's see if the 9,000th
time's the charm.

03:30.768 --> 03:34.103
(Musical whooshing and whistling)

03:34.589 --> 03:37.812

04:07.679 --> 04:09.524
Are you looking for me?

04:15.166 --> 04:19.428
== sync & corrections by Wolfhound ==
== www.addic7ed.com ==

04:30.067 --> 04:32.049
Why aren't you working
with the other girls?

04:32.593 --> 04:33.995
They just slow me down.

04:34.936 --> 04:36.832
Look, I've done this before.

04:36.834 --> 04:38.101
Last year, I had Esther's grimoire.

04:38.131 --> 04:39.801
I studied it cover to cover.

04:39.803 --> 04:41.670
Now I know more about
breaking the sire link

04:41.700 --> 04:43.588
than any other witch.

04:44.245 --> 04:46.432
How lovely, but as it is my life

04:46.462 --> 04:48.266
that depends upon the
completion of that spell,

04:48.296 --> 04:51.102
it will be my coven that
verifies your work.

04:51.132 --> 04:52.152
Fine.

04:52.182 --> 04:53.849
Let them verify it.

04:54.677 --> 04:56.296
So, then...

04:58.110 --> 04:59.771
have you finished?

05:01.760 --> 05:03.492
All I need is the binding agent.

05:03.494 --> 05:06.077
And what will that require?

05:06.079 --> 05:07.384
My spell is based off the one

05:07.414 --> 05:08.520
that the Mikaelsons' mother used

05:08.550 --> 05:10.803
to make them vampires
in the first place.

05:10.927 --> 05:14.202
She was an artist. She had her
own unique way of doing things.

05:14.204 --> 05:15.376
If I'm gonna finish this spell,

05:15.406 --> 05:17.965
I need someone who knew her techniques.

05:19.292 --> 05:20.542
Let me guess.

05:20.544 --> 05:22.192
Someone like...

05:22.462 --> 05:23.879
Kol Mikaelson.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.075
If you want the spell.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.218
Tread carefully, Davina Claire.

05:30.961 --> 05:32.506
Every negotiation has a moment

05:32.536 --> 05:34.222
where the lesser party must submit.

05:34.433 --> 05:35.433
(Sighs)

05:35.748 --> 05:39.099
You are very quickly approaching yours.

05:40.086 --> 05:42.280
Let the sisters help me resurrect Kol.

05:42.524 --> 05:45.116
He'll give us the missing
ingredient, I promise.

05:45.118 --> 05:49.070
If not, you may never find it.

05:54.409 --> 05:55.927
(Sighs)

06:13.852 --> 06:15.647
I assume you know what this is.

06:16.452 --> 06:18.099
It's a <i>Hand of Glory</i>.

06:18.571 --> 06:20.952
A mystic candle, when lit,

06:20.982 --> 06:22.688
it will let me open any window.

06:22.879 --> 06:25.524
Even one to the afterworld.

06:27.035 --> 06:29.077
So I can only see Kol

06:29.553 --> 06:31.613
until that creepy thing
burns down to nothing,

06:31.615 --> 06:32.914
and then he's gone?

06:33.787 --> 06:37.185
If you want Kol to remain permanently,

06:37.215 --> 06:40.872
make sure he gives us
the information we need.

06:56.018 --> 06:57.594
(Children playing)

06:57.624 --> 06:59.958
Come to pay your respects?

07:04.856 --> 07:07.465
It's easy to speak well of Jackson.

07:08.237 --> 07:10.053
He was a good man.

07:10.526 --> 07:12.336
Though it's a bit macabre, isn't it?

07:12.366 --> 07:14.293
Burying his heart under a sapling.

07:14.323 --> 07:16.823
At least Hope will have
a place to visit him.

07:17.098 --> 07:19.865
I don't want her to forget
how much he loved her.

07:21.673 --> 07:24.305
I am sorry... for your loss.

07:24.335 --> 07:27.624
Mm, everybody's sorry.

07:28.062 --> 07:30.371
Doesn't make a whole lot
of difference, does it?

07:30.373 --> 07:31.964
Perhaps not.

07:33.459 --> 07:35.290
I've heard that time heals all wounds,

07:35.320 --> 07:37.337
but that has not been my own experience.

07:37.742 --> 07:39.664
I wonder if keeping busy

07:39.694 --> 07:42.675
might help distract you from your grief.

07:45.154 --> 07:47.279
You have something in mind?

07:48.054 --> 07:51.900
Aurora's still at large, no doubt
plotting her revenge.

07:52.114 --> 07:54.082
She used to Camille to get to me once.

07:54.112 --> 07:55.003
She may do so again.

07:55.033 --> 07:57.128
And Cami is rather vulnerable.

07:57.517 --> 08:00.819
I'd like to provide some safeguarding.

08:01.164 --> 08:03.571
Isn't that your job?

08:05.200 --> 08:06.370
No.

08:07.748 --> 08:08.848
Not anymore.

08:14.109 --> 08:15.425
Fine.

08:15.810 --> 08:19.204
(Phone buzzes)

08:20.929 --> 08:22.446
Can I assume

08:22.476 --> 08:25.949
our very gifted sister has
finally found my lunatic ex?

08:26.433 --> 08:29.514
From the looks of things...

08:29.665 --> 08:32.206
I would say that
the lunatic ex found Freya.

08:32.285 --> 08:34.503
Well, then, we'll procure
another witch to track her.

08:35.953 --> 08:37.255
There's no need.

08:37.866 --> 08:39.643
I got something.

08:57.380 --> 08:58.756
Let me guess.

08:58.786 --> 09:00.624
Aya needs something else done.

09:00.793 --> 09:04.115
Actually, I came to let you
know I'm on your side.

09:06.219 --> 09:07.802
Then maybe you can tell Aya

09:07.804 --> 09:09.638
to let me bring back Kol permanently.

09:09.913 --> 09:13.279
D, I hear you, but we
need to talk priorities.

09:13.309 --> 09:14.347
Kol has been dead.

09:14.377 --> 09:16.266
He can stay dead a little while longer.

09:16.296 --> 09:18.757
But my life could end at any minute.

09:19.758 --> 09:20.999
I know.

09:25.466 --> 09:26.501
Just please tell me

09:26.531 --> 09:28.478
- you don't trust her.
- I don't.

09:28.508 --> 09:31.682
But I do trust you, and
I need you to trust me.

09:31.712 --> 09:33.961
Okay, Aya's always gonna
be playing her own game,

09:33.991 --> 09:36.403
just like everybody else in this town,

09:36.433 --> 09:38.689
but now more than ever,
we got to stick together.

09:39.322 --> 09:42.679
And when this is over,
I will help you raise

09:42.709 --> 09:45.040
your pain-in-the ass
boyfriend from the dead.

09:48.308 --> 09:49.728
Klaus: "A forest of pine.

09:49.730 --> 09:52.233
"And a box made so fine.

09:52.263 --> 09:54.894
"Come quickly. If not,
then poor Freya shall rot,

09:54.924 --> 09:56.581
"buried in dirt for all time."

09:56.611 --> 09:57.641
The woman is insane.

09:57.671 --> 09:59.092
Does she have to punish us

09:59.122 --> 10:00.673
with the world's most
unfortunate limerick?

10:00.886 --> 10:01.957
Is it not enough that we're forced

10:01.959 --> 10:03.663
to play her wretched games?

10:03.693 --> 10:06.898
Freya saw a vision
of herself buried alive.

10:06.928 --> 10:09.297
Aurora will do everything in her power

10:09.299 --> 10:11.259
to bring about this miserable prophecy.

10:11.450 --> 10:13.468
Let's go stop her, shall we?

10:16.473 --> 10:19.474
(Birds chirping)

10:20.155 --> 10:22.060
(Gasps)

10:31.514 --> 10:33.655
What did you do to me?

10:34.655 --> 10:36.180
I used the same concoction on you

10:36.210 --> 10:38.433
that my brother crafted for my...

10:38.463 --> 10:39.845
episodes.

10:40.257 --> 10:42.553
It's rather effective, wouldn't you say?

10:42.724 --> 10:44.303
(Stammering)

10:44.333 --> 10:45.367
Oh...

10:45.805 --> 10:47.234
(Shudders)

10:48.158 --> 10:50.005
Poor dear.

10:50.263 --> 10:52.758
To think, Freya, we
could've been sisters.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.898
Unfortunately, I've spent
enough time with witches

10:56.928 --> 10:59.559
to know that casting
spells requires focus,

10:59.589 --> 11:00.716
and focus requires

11:00.718 --> 11:02.380
clarity of mind,

11:02.410 --> 11:04.660
something you don't currently have.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.663
My brothers will come for me.

11:06.693 --> 11:07.715
(Laughs)

11:07.745 --> 11:10.888
That's good. 'Cause that's precisely
what I'm counting on.

11:10.918 --> 11:13.771
The only question is...

11:13.801 --> 11:16.123
Will you still be alive
when they get here?

11:16.867 --> 11:18.408
(Gunshot)

11:26.855 --> 11:30.522
♪♪

11:30.552 --> 11:32.267
(Door closes)

11:33.302 --> 11:35.657
(Footsteps approaching)

11:36.174 --> 11:38.655
Your doorbell is broken downstairs.

11:38.685 --> 11:41.130
I keep forgetting to compel
the shady landlord to fix it.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.843
Next time, text.

11:43.079 --> 11:44.038
You could get hurt,

11:44.068 --> 11:46.916
sneaking up on someone with
a stockpile of dark objects.

11:46.946 --> 11:47.837
Was it worth it?

11:47.867 --> 11:49.321
Risking the lives of, oh,

11:49.351 --> 11:51.557
every vampire in existence

11:51.587 --> 11:53.208
over your petty fight with Klaus?

11:53.238 --> 11:54.834
And here I thought
this was a social call.

11:54.864 --> 11:56.740
More like a wake-up call, Cami.

11:56.742 --> 11:57.958
You haven't been yourself lately,

11:57.993 --> 12:00.092
and in your less-than-sane moments,

12:00.122 --> 12:02.334
you have been putting the people
that I care about in danger.

12:02.364 --> 12:04.325
See, I sort of thought
I had proven myself.

12:04.819 --> 12:07.439
I did risk what was left
of my life to save yours.

12:09.607 --> 12:12.048

I don't know, being
dead, drinking blood,

You're right.

Great.

You don't need a lecture,

19:32.607 --> 19:34.070
Speaking of,

19:34.100 --> 19:36.562
you're very welcome to remain a ghost,

19:36.592 --> 19:39.724

The de-siring spell I was

19:45.545 --> 19:48.143

kill it or to kill me.

19:48.173 --> 19:49.695
If she was worried, then
I must have been close,

19:49.725 --> 19:52.071
and you must have known how close.

19:52.101 --> 19:53.392
Which means you know how to finish it.

19:53.515 --> 19:54.236
Aya: In other words,

19:54.271 --> 19:56.855
you will provide the missing ingredient.

19:57.539 --> 19:58.939
The binding agent.

20:00.310 --> 20:01.556
Now.

20:02.007 --> 20:04.157
I'd forgotten how cuddly you are.

20:04.534 --> 20:06.427
If you want me to talk, fine.

20:06.457 --> 20:08.357

That look.

20:35.833 --> 20:37.362
I know it all too well.

20:38.607 --> 20:40.053
You think, somehow, I'm responsible

20:40.083 --> 20:41.533
for your little breakup.

20:41.535 --> 20:45.242
How adorably delusional of you, Aurora.

20:45.272 --> 20:47.922
You do realize that
you're utterly insane?

20:49.233 --> 20:50.609
Niklaus can be resilient,

20:50.661 --> 20:53.612
but there's only so much
madness even he can take.

20:55.627 --> 20:57.237
I suppose, eventually,

20:57.239 --> 21:00.203
he was able to distinguish
between real love

21:00.233 --> 21:04.075
and some... petty desire.

21:05.313 --> 21:07.280
Once he'd discarded you,

21:07.315 --> 21:09.365
the veil was lifted
and all that remained

21:09.401 --> 21:12.549
was something quite pathetic.

21:14.072 --> 21:16.010
The veil is lifted, all right.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.290
Love is nothing but a trap.

21:18.292 --> 21:19.502
The one truth you speak,

21:19.532 --> 21:22.792
the one thing that I
agree with entirely...

21:24.015 --> 21:26.461
Only the love of family is unbreakable.

21:28.610 --> 21:32.355
It is the only love worth fighting for.

21:32.390 --> 21:35.307
And my beloved brother, Tristan,

21:35.309 --> 21:36.645
suffers in a box,

21:36.675 --> 21:39.511
drowning over and over again,

21:39.541 --> 21:41.381
unable to die.

21:41.965 --> 21:46.318
So I will end his suffering
by ending you, his sire.

21:46.371 --> 21:49.194
And the look on Niklaus's face

21:49.224 --> 21:52.225
as a white oak bullet pierces your heart

21:52.260 --> 21:53.860
and takes your life...

21:56.381 --> 21:59.065
Will be the salve for
my own broken heart.

22:02.532 --> 22:04.687
Stop this.

22:04.739 --> 22:06.194
Why?

22:06.941 --> 22:09.025
One brother's life to end
another brother's torment?

22:09.027 --> 22:10.326
It's almost poetic.

22:10.361 --> 22:11.527
The bullets...

22:11.579 --> 22:12.945
they're white oak, Niklaus.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.033
Klaus: We both know

22:17.035 --> 22:18.951
you're not going to pull the trigger.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.590
Yet again, you're wrong.

22:24.626 --> 22:26.042

22:32.440 --> 22:33.860

22:34.385 --> 22:36.052
I have to murder my ex.

22:46.911 --> 22:49.000
Esther Mikaelson was two things:

22:49.030 --> 22:50.308
a-a genius witch

22:50.338 --> 22:52.698
and an overprotective matriarch.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.950
The sire link is a facet
of her most powerful spell

22:54.980 --> 22:58.015
used to protect those she loved most.

22:58.045 --> 22:59.705
And, as such...

22:59.757 --> 23:01.248
(Sighs)

23:01.278 --> 23:03.125
it's impossible to break.

23:05.279 --> 23:06.500
You know, I can tell you're lying to me,

23:06.530 --> 23:08.541
no matter what face you wear.

23:10.598 --> 23:11.901
Don't you get it?

23:11.953 --> 23:12.985
If I can break the sire link,

23:13.015 --> 23:16.553
I can use the power of the
sisters to bring you back.

23:17.388 --> 23:19.108
Kol, we can finally be together.

23:19.143 --> 23:20.062
Why won't you just tell me?

23:20.092 --> 23:21.744
Because, darling, I guarantee

23:21.746 --> 23:22.962
you won't like the answer.

23:22.997 --> 23:24.580
(Sighs) Fine.

23:24.632 --> 23:26.382
At least I know it's not impossible.

23:26.927 --> 23:29.084
Please don't do this.

23:31.056 --> 23:32.588
Kol's linked to that candle,

23:33.171 --> 23:35.224
so whatever our two lovebirds say,

23:35.887 --> 23:37.661
our witches will be able to hear it.

23:37.691 --> 23:40.381
I don't think that a few more minutes of
privacy is too much to ask.

23:40.411 --> 23:42.961
I don't give a damn about young love.

23:43.567 --> 23:44.934
They have a task.

23:44.936 --> 23:46.966
They had better finish it.

23:51.234 --> 23:52.608
Davina: Esther cast the spell.

23:52.610 --> 23:54.610
You died with vampire
blood in your system,

23:54.662 --> 23:56.398
came back, fed.

23:56.428 --> 23:58.113
Then you were vampires.

23:58.115 --> 24:00.077
(Sighs) So...

24:00.107 --> 24:01.823
the core of the sire link

24:01.853 --> 24:03.352
has to be blood.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.820
If there's a loophole,
it's blood-related.

24:04.856 --> 24:06.739
Not just blood-related.

24:06.774 --> 24:09.525
For it to work, someone has to die.

24:09.527 --> 24:10.642
So please, stop.

24:10.672 --> 24:12.745
The spell centers around blood,

24:12.780 --> 24:14.497
but just taking someone's
blood wouldn't kill them.

24:14.532 --> 24:16.332
- You need their heart.
- Look, I understand

24:16.367 --> 24:18.250
you want to bring me back,
but this is a devil's bargain.

24:18.286 --> 24:20.889
It has to be more complicated than that.

24:20.919 --> 24:22.371
It can't just be any old vampire,

24:22.423 --> 24:24.507
the heart has to be special.

24:24.542 --> 24:26.125
(Davina sighs)

24:27.018 --> 24:29.879
Do you need a heart outside the link?

24:31.933 --> 24:33.516
An unsired heart.

24:33.551 --> 24:34.717
- Damn it, Davina!
- ln 1,000 years,

24:34.719 --> 24:35.925
there hasn't been a vampire

24:35.955 --> 24:39.054
born outside a line, un... til...

24:49.784 --> 24:51.450
Marcel: What do they say?

24:52.149 --> 24:53.402
The missing ingredient

24:53.404 --> 24:55.821
is the heart of an unsired vampire.

25:00.411 --> 25:01.535
Hayley Marshall was turned

25:01.565 --> 25:03.412
by the magic infused in
her own child's blood.

25:03.414 --> 25:05.211
- Oh, hell no.
- Not by another vampire.

25:05.241 --> 25:07.007
Look, you're not going after...

25:10.665 --> 25:12.120
Locate her.

25:12.310 --> 25:13.923
Now.

25:17.639 --> 25:19.239
You were right to run.

25:19.981 --> 25:22.097
What I'm going to do to you

25:22.366 --> 25:25.317
will redefine the word "sadistic."

25:25.353 --> 25:26.602
(Whooshing)

25:26.604 --> 25:29.321
(Gunshot)

25:30.184 --> 25:32.658
It was such a beautifully
carved little knight.

25:33.523 --> 25:35.444
I could tell the effort you put into it.

25:37.615 --> 25:40.282
Since you have such an
appreciation for chess...

25:42.146 --> 25:44.954
queen takes king.

25:46.457 --> 25:47.289
Ah!

25:59.887 --> 26:01.637
(Grunts)

26:03.721 --> 26:05.057
Again.

26:08.980 --> 26:10.863
(Grunts)

26:11.384 --> 26:12.804
Again!

26:12.834 --> 26:15.536
Come on, post-grad, you
can do better than that.

26:18.506 --> 26:20.005
Ah!

26:20.675 --> 26:21.674
Again.

26:23.845 --> 26:25.311
(Groans)

26:25.346 --> 26:27.513
(Laughs)

26:27.839 --> 26:29.565
- Oh, look at you.
- (Laughs breathlessly)

26:29.600 --> 26:31.317
We keep that up,

26:31.352 --> 26:34.013
you might be giving
Josh a run for his money.

26:34.043 --> 26:35.905
Hey.

26:36.539 --> 26:38.023
Thanks for coming to find me today.

26:38.626 --> 26:40.526
Oh, don't get all mushy on me.

26:40.870 --> 26:42.676
You're a bartender.

26:42.706 --> 26:44.196
You can thank me with a beer.

26:44.198 --> 26:46.248
- Deal. (Laughs)
- (Phone buzzing)

26:49.779 --> 26:50.586
Hey.

26:50.621 --> 26:52.037
Hayley, you have to listen to me.

26:52.089 --> 26:53.589
Aya's witches are coming to kill you.

26:53.624 --> 26:54.624
What?

26:56.544 --> 26:57.543
Get out of here.

26:57.545 --> 26:58.711
Right now.

26:58.763 --> 27:01.430
(Screams)

27:01.466 --> 27:03.265
(Groaning)

27:06.220 --> 27:08.220
(Moans, pants)

27:10.441 --> 27:11.557
Ah!

27:24.405 --> 27:26.455
(Grunts)

27:30.411 --> 27:31.911
(Shouts)

27:32.914 --> 27:34.463
(Groaning)

27:36.801 --> 27:38.083
(Chokes)

27:39.136 --> 27:42.087
(Groaning continues)

27:56.320 --> 27:57.937
(Grunting)

28:02.310 --> 28:03.742
Looking for this?

28:03.778 --> 28:05.878
White oak seems wasted on you...

28:07.949 --> 28:09.615
but it will kill you, just the same.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.784
Nik, please.

28:15.673 --> 28:17.623
You never should've come back.

28:18.534 --> 28:20.384
You never should've let me.

28:21.295 --> 28:23.212
(Grunts)

28:30.249 --> 28:31.020
I'm sorry.

28:31.055 --> 28:32.855
Elijah: Put it down.

28:32.890 --> 28:34.139
(Gunshot)

28:50.819 --> 28:52.869
(Groaning)

28:52.904 --> 28:54.070
Oh...

28:57.075 --> 28:59.397
You want my heart? Then come and get it!

28:59.427 --> 29:00.660
(Groaning continues)

29:04.130 --> 29:05.400
What are you doing?

29:05.430 --> 29:06.633
The sisters already found Hayley.

29:06.668 --> 29:08.480
- I have to help her.
- You'll never make it there in time.

29:08.510 --> 29:09.868
I'm not just gonna let her die.

29:09.898 --> 29:12.839
Then stop and let me help you.

29:13.211 --> 29:14.550
For better or worse, you're linked

29:14.580 --> 29:16.217
to this nasty little coven.

29:16.247 --> 29:18.178
Which means if I take you down...

29:19.645 --> 29:22.044
The sisters go down, too.

29:22.771 --> 29:24.684
How are you gonna do magic?

29:25.159 --> 29:27.070
I'll draw it from the candle
that's holding me here.

29:33.238 --> 29:34.160
It's not the sexiest way

29:34.196 --> 29:36.196
to spend our final
moments together, but...

29:36.930 --> 29:38.558
You can make it up to me.

29:38.887 --> 29:40.160
Night on the town

29:40.190 --> 29:41.990
in a little black dress...

29:42.198 --> 29:43.870
(Chuckles)

29:54.966 --> 29:56.382
(Groans)

29:59.500 --> 30:01.054
(Panting)

30:04.624 --> 30:06.809
Definitely our worst date ever.

30:09.064 --> 30:10.446
(Blood sloshing)

30:10.482 --> 30:13.032
(Elijah screaming)

30:13.068 --> 30:15.618
(Gasping)

30:16.241 --> 30:17.954
The bullet didn't puncture your heart.

30:17.989 --> 30:22.734
Leave... me... and finish her.

30:22.764 --> 30:23.960
(Heart beating)

30:26.164 --> 30:27.880
It gets closer with every beat.

30:27.916 --> 30:29.415
(Grunts, panting)

30:29.910 --> 30:31.217
I have to stop it.

30:31.253 --> 30:32.752
No. No.

30:32.754 --> 30:34.545
We made a promise.

30:34.575 --> 30:35.805
Don't do this.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.640
I am not going to leave you.

30:40.595 --> 30:42.262
(Neck snaps, heartbeat stops)

30:47.102 --> 30:49.018
(Grunts)

30:52.440 --> 30:54.274
(Grunts)

31:02.367 --> 31:04.367
(Heart beating)

31:09.874 --> 31:12.792
(Groaning)

31:15.661 --> 31:17.597
I thought I smelled arrogance.

31:17.632 --> 31:19.754
I think you meant "confidence."

31:19.784 --> 31:21.367
But I can understand how the uneducated

31:21.419 --> 31:22.640
are apt to confuse the two.

31:22.670 --> 31:24.170
Yeah? You want to tell me

31:24.222 --> 31:26.556
what your dead-eyed
drones want with my heart?

31:26.591 --> 31:28.224
It's nothing personal.

31:28.503 --> 31:30.843
I just value my life above yours.

31:33.348 --> 31:35.348
(Both grunting)

31:40.522 --> 31:42.522
Aya, you take her
heart, you start a war.

31:44.275 --> 31:46.594
Don't let your association
with werewolf trash

31:46.624 --> 31:48.581
cloud the opportunity before you.

31:50.698 --> 31:51.697
(Grunts)

31:52.264 --> 31:53.775
The Mikaelsons will kill us

31:53.805 --> 31:57.165
before you can even light
the candles on that spell.

31:57.956 --> 31:59.205
(Both grunting)

32:00.855 --> 32:02.645
There is no alternative.

32:02.675 --> 32:03.876
You're wrong.

32:03.878 --> 32:06.379
Give me a few hours to
set this thing straight.

32:06.887 --> 32:09.265
Or push me out of the
way and condemn yourself

32:09.300 --> 32:13.215
and everyone else in the Strix
to a slow and painful death.

32:13.245 --> 32:14.770
(Both grunting)

32:14.806 --> 32:17.229
I want to be de-linked
just as much as you do.

32:17.259 --> 32:20.560
Give me the chance to
do it the right way.

32:23.147 --> 32:24.397
(Panting)

32:25.245 --> 32:27.617
Bring me a solution by midnight,

32:28.689 --> 32:30.807
or I will rip out your heart

32:30.837 --> 32:33.572
right before I come back and take hers.

32:35.410 --> 32:37.410
(Panting)

32:44.686 --> 32:46.652
(Playing jazz music, ship
horn blowing in distance)

32:59.534 --> 33:01.000
(Sighs)

33:09.141 --> 33:12.553
_

33:18.028 --> 33:21.015
The attack was about
breaking the sire link.

33:21.561 --> 33:22.805
Marcel told me that Aya's witches

33:22.857 --> 33:25.166
already have a spell to do it.

33:25.677 --> 33:27.610
And how does your heart
play into all of this?

33:27.645 --> 33:30.553
I'm the only un-sired
vampire in history.

33:30.583 --> 33:32.878
Apparently, that's the
key to making it work.

33:32.908 --> 33:35.712
And yet, Marcel neglected
to mention it this morning.

33:35.742 --> 33:37.219
Hey, ease up.

33:37.221 --> 33:38.460
He saved me.

33:38.490 --> 33:40.175
But the Strix might yet come for you.

33:40.205 --> 33:41.179
Let them.

33:41.209 --> 33:42.287
I'm not an easy target.

33:42.317 --> 33:45.817
They'd be better off trying
to find some witchy workaround.

33:47.207 --> 33:48.957
Unless they already have.

33:51.817 --> 33:53.402
They need my heart.

33:54.194 --> 33:56.989
Or one that's identical to it.

33:58.687 --> 34:00.159
Jackson.

34:04.506 --> 34:05.506
(Sighs)

34:06.566 --> 34:09.802
The unification ceremony
didn't just marry us,

34:10.308 --> 34:11.420
it also made his heart

34:11.422 --> 34:13.505
a mirror image of mine.

34:17.344 --> 34:18.886
We need to dig it up.

34:18.916 --> 34:19.804
Klaus.

34:19.833 --> 34:22.103
Aurora's bullet very
nearly killed Elijah.

34:22.132 --> 34:23.933
When she returns, and she will,

34:23.967 --> 34:25.768
I would prefer the
vampires of New Orleans

34:25.803 --> 34:27.136
be obligated to protect us.

34:27.188 --> 34:28.471
They'll be more likely to do so

34:28.523 --> 34:31.139
if our lives remain linked to theirs.

34:34.007 --> 34:35.610
Niklaus is right.

34:36.398 --> 34:38.563
The sire-link has to remain unbroken.

34:41.030 --> 34:42.293
We have to go.

34:46.157 --> 34:50.993
♪ You are the fire to my thoughts ♪

34:51.045 --> 34:55.214
♪ The spark that starts it all ♪

34:56.751 --> 34:58.384

34:58.419 --> 34:59.802
Hardly.

35:00.177 --> 35:01.470
Now, watching you sleep has been

35:01.506 --> 35:03.506
the most fun I've had in months.

35:03.508 --> 35:05.007
(Sniffles)

35:05.009 --> 35:07.343
I'll bring you back soon. She promised.

35:08.493 --> 35:11.147
I appreciate you trying.

35:11.182 --> 35:13.349
But Aya never keeps her promises.

35:14.569 --> 35:16.157
Seriously, darling.

35:16.928 --> 35:18.354
But you have to let me go.

35:18.786 --> 35:20.189
The longer you stay in this coven,

35:20.191 --> 35:22.024
the more dangerous it becomes for you.

35:22.026 --> 35:25.077
Then I'll bring you back and
we'll take them on together.

35:25.875 --> 35:28.664
We can do anything, can't we?

35:29.865 --> 35:31.083
Please?

35:34.121 --> 35:36.505
I love you, Kol Mikaelson.

And return the favor tenfold.

36:52.557 --> 36:54.950
This is your solution, Marcel?

36:54.952 --> 36:56.919
The heart of a dead werewolf?

36:56.954 --> 36:59.838
Well, not just any
werewolf, Hayley's husband.

37:01.542 --> 37:05.294
I was at her wedding. His
heart became one with hers.

37:05.575 --> 37:06.769
Ask Davina.

37:07.098 --> 37:08.180
He's right.

37:08.215 --> 37:10.521
I wouldn't be here if
it wasn't gonna work.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.970
I assume the grieving widow
didn't just hand it over.

37:15.804 --> 37:17.263
Pray tell,

37:17.293 --> 37:19.642
how did you procure this little gem?

37:19.644 --> 37:21.527
This is my city.

37:21.562 --> 37:24.313
Nothing happens in
it without me knowing.

37:34.875 --> 37:36.492
You're welcome.

37:43.231 --> 37:46.001
You did prove yourself quite
the creative leader today.

37:46.053 --> 37:48.387
Yeah, I'd say so,
considering I just found a way

37:48.422 --> 37:51.572
to keep you and everyone
in this organization alive.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.680
I want to be free of the Mikaelsons

37:57.682 --> 37:59.481
just as much as you do.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.901
Get in the way of that again,
and I will be just as creative

38:02.937 --> 38:05.268
in finding a way to kill you.

38:05.690 --> 38:07.823
(Chuckles softly)

38:07.858 --> 38:10.242
Don't be cross, Marcel Gerard.

38:10.739 --> 38:12.596
You're finally starting to learn.

38:12.626 --> 38:16.365
Commitment to a common goal
is as strong a bond as family.

38:32.550 --> 38:35.851
Practicing your torture
techniques, Niklaus?

38:36.171 --> 38:37.720
Clearing my mind.

38:39.440 --> 38:42.358
Some children cuddle with a blanket.

38:42.393 --> 38:44.643
Mine loves her chess piece.

38:46.564 --> 38:48.781
Aren't you full of surprises.

38:53.404 --> 38:55.738
You're surprised I came for you.

39:05.249 --> 39:07.332
You are my sister, Freya.

39:09.336 --> 39:12.109
And you are a part of this family,

39:12.402 --> 39:14.566
always and forever.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.996
Do you know, I never thought
I'd hear myself say this,

39:18.026 --> 39:21.764
but I wholeheartedly agree with Niklaus.

39:25.405 --> 39:27.319
So...

39:27.564 --> 39:29.493
what's going to be our next move?

39:29.951 --> 39:31.573
Aurora has more white oak,

39:31.609 --> 39:34.493
and she's not gonna stay quiet for long.

39:34.995 --> 39:38.113
Aurora's not the only problem.

39:39.136 --> 39:40.833
Yes, it seems there's no shortage

39:40.868 --> 39:43.285
of those who would
stand against our family.

39:45.790 --> 39:47.840
Let's kill them all.

39:52.963 --> 39:54.963
(Crickets chirping)

40:10.359 --> 40:11.947
You've been following me for miles, Aya,

40:11.982 --> 40:14.149
and I'm really not in
the mood for a chat.

40:14.201 --> 40:16.785
Then I'll be brief.

40:17.220 --> 40:18.987
I've come to make a proposal.

40:19.447 --> 40:22.574
To offer you my assistance
in your future endeavors.

40:25.539 --> 40:28.630
I know who I want to kill and
how exactly I intend to do it.

40:28.666 --> 40:30.466
So what good are you to me?

40:31.707 --> 40:33.969
Having a clear target
and hitting the bull's-eye

40:34.004 --> 40:36.388
are two very different things.

40:38.956 --> 40:40.559
Much easier when you have the help

40:40.594 --> 40:42.177
of a determined ally.

40:42.229 --> 40:44.930
Assuming of course we
can find common ground.

40:48.057 --> 40:50.736
I suspect our worlds
can change with a bang.
