WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.397
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.430 --> 00:04.068
Mycroft,
what are you doing here?

00:04.100 --> 00:06.295
Have you come back here
to sleep with Watson again?

00:06.340 --> 00:09.332
Why should we deny ourselves
the chance at something

00:09.370 --> 00:11.167
just because Sherlock
will make it difﬁcult?

00:11.210 --> 00:13.132
I went to see
Mycroft today.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.740
Thi_s man's name is
Gurllaume De Soto.

00:15.780 --> 00:17.600
The DST in France
have long suspected

00:17.650 --> 00:20.039
that he is a high-ranking
lieutenant in Le Milieu.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.377
And their New York
office, apparently,

00:21.420 --> 00:23.615
is now headquartered
at Diogenes.

00:23.650 --> 00:26.210
WATSON: This guy was eating with
the man that you noticed.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.818
MAN (French accent):
You take my picture,

00:27.860 --> 00:29.521
I take yours.

00:29.560 --> 00:30.652
(muffled screaming)

00:43.640 --> 00:46.609
(phone ringing)

00:49.710 --> 00:51.746
Sorry I'm late.

00:51.780 --> 00:54.248
I was perusing the restaurant's
wine cellar, then I realized...

00:54.280 --> 00:57.340
GUILLAUME (French accent):
Monsieur Holmes.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.482
Who is this?

00:58.520 --> 01:00.681
Think. It will come to you.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.553
I crossed paths
with a friend of yours earlier

01:03.590 --> 01:04.852
at a restaurant.

01:04.890 --> 01:08.621
For all our sakes,
I wish I had not.

01:08.660 --> 01:10.662
WATSON (recorded):
Hi. You've reached Joan Watson.

01:10.700 --> 01:11.667
Please leave a message.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.236
(beep)

01:13.270 --> 01:15.090
Watson, this is my fifth message
in as many hours.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.461
Either you're engaging in
a marathon lovemaking session

01:17.510 --> 01:19.398
with my brother,
or you've realized

01:19.440 --> 01:22.341
that I was right about him and
you just don't want to admit it.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.247
Given his advancing years
and no doubt flagging endurance,

01:25.280 --> 01:26.645
_ _the latter _
IS a Virtual certainty.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.183
Anyway, I assure you,
I am not looking for

01:29.220 --> 01:31.780
any kind of recognition
or appreciation,

01:31.820 --> 01:34.516
even though I likely deserve
both for saving you from months

01:34.560 --> 01:37.779
or years or even a lifetime
of misery.

01:37.830 --> 01:39.195
I merely wanted to...

01:39.230 --> 01:41.221
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Message complete. Good-bye.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.468
(line ringing)

01:47.500 --> 01:48.899
WATSON:
Hi. You've reached Joan Watson.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.703
Please leave a message.
(beep)

01:50.740 --> 01:52.799
Yes, call me back
and let me know you're okay.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.808
(doorbell rings)

02:01.280 --> 02:04.317
Something's wrong.

02:04.350 --> 02:06.716
We need to talk.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.897
(men speaking French)

02:32.880 --> 02:35.769
(men continue speaking French)

02:46.400 --> 02:48.197
Huh.

02:48.230 --> 02:51.893
I was beginning to worry
I used, uh, too much chloroform.

02:54.470 --> 02:55.937
Where am I?

02:55.970 --> 02:58.700
What am I doing here?

02:58.740 --> 03:00.776
You do not remember
followmg me?

03:05.280 --> 03:06.838
(sighs)

03:09.690 --> 03:11.681
You are very
beautiful.

03:13.690 --> 03:14.952
For a cop.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.252
I'm not a cop.

03:16.290 --> 03:17.985
Not a cop.

03:18.030 --> 03:21.488
Then why did I find an
NYPD identification card

03:21.530 --> 03:22.861
in your purse?

03:22.900 --> 03:25.892
Why did I find this?

03:25.930 --> 03:27.795
I'm a consultant.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.330
I work with the police.

03:29.370 --> 03:33.238
A distinction
without distinction.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.975
_ I_was_n't
Investigating you.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.477
Not for the department.

03:36.510 --> 03:37.977
I just thought
my friend should know

03:38.010 --> 03:40.319
that Le Milieu was frequenting
his restaurant, that's all.

03:40.350 --> 03:43.547
Your "friend."

03:43.590 --> 03:45.649
Mycroft.

03:45.690 --> 03:47.009
You know him?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.483
Iam, uh...

03:49.530 --> 03:51.020
(speaks French)

03:51.060 --> 03:52.425
...a regular.

03:52.460 --> 03:55.554
As is my friend,
Monsieur De Soto.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.024
He's the one
who noticed you the other day.

03:59.070 --> 04:01.994
He's the one who gave me
your picture.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.962
Call Mycroft.
He'll explain...

04:04.010 --> 04:07.434
He and Monsieur De Soto
have already spoken.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.870
A deal has been made.

04:14.350 --> 04:17.786
Your friend
will help mine

04:17.820 --> 04:19.287
with a problem,

04:19.320 --> 04:23.950
or... you and Mycroft

04:23.990 --> 04:26.527
will be friends
no more.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.256
Hmm?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.763
(panﬁng)

04:32.800 --> 04:35.064
You know, I told her what
you were. I told her.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.432
She wouldn't listen.
Sherlock...

04:37.470 --> 04:39.631
I knew you were lazy,
I knew you were an idiot,

04:39.680 --> 04:42.035
but_to allow a criminal
syndicate to set up shop

04:42.080 --> 04:43.809
in your stupid
restaurant...

04:43.850 --> 04:44.839
I told you.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.643
You were sick. Hmm?

04:46.680 --> 04:47.772
The economy took
a downturn.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.811
You needed to make payroll!

04:49.850 --> 04:52.683
The people who work for me
are more than just employees!

04:52.720 --> 04:53.812
They're family!

04:53.860 --> 04:55.452
They were counting on me!

04:55.490 --> 04:59.426
You could have asked
our father for the money!

05:03.070 --> 05:05.061
Is that what you'd have done,
Sherlock?

05:06.770 --> 05:08.590
Sought help from him?

05:13.610 --> 05:15.976
At first,
their requests were small:

05:16.010 --> 05:18.604
buy wine from
one of their friends,

05:18.650 --> 05:20.470
obtain the occasional work visa.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.078
Then the requests got bigger,
did they?

05:22.120 --> 05:24.111
A little bit_ of
money laundering here,

05:24.150 --> 05:26.084
smuggling between
continents there.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.055
The New York branch
of Diogenes-- their idea.

05:29.090 --> 05:31.354
They wanted a foothold
in the American economy,

05:31.390 --> 05:32.596
and now they've got one.

05:32.630 --> 05:36.361
You know, I wish
it had taken you.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.637
The leukemia.

05:40.670 --> 05:44.367
I wish it had
rotted you to bones.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.839
Sometimes...

05:51.080 --> 05:53.548
...I wish the very same thing.

06:00.860 --> 06:04.159
So, you said you struck
some sort of deal with them.

06:04.190 --> 06:07.159
Explain it to me.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.589
MYCROFI':
His name is Pierce Norman.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.393
He was, until very recently,

06:11.430 --> 06:14.661
vice president for American
operations at Credit Versoix,

06:14.700 --> 06:17.430
one of the largest private
banking firms in Switzerland.

06:17.470 --> 06:19.404
Tell me something I can't read
in his corporate biography.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.169
Four days ago,

06:21.210 --> 06:23.075
he used the computer
in his New York office

06:23.110 --> 06:25.078
to download the names of
thousands of the bank's

06:25.110 --> 06:26.839
wealthiest customers

06:26.880 --> 06:28.916
and take snapshots of
their private accounts.

06:28.950 --> 06:31.089
How much do you know
about Swiss banking?

06:31.120 --> 06:33.418
Enough to know that his actions
were not just a violation

06:33.460 --> 06:35.758
of the policy of his bank,
but also of Swiss law.

06:35.790 --> 06:38.020
If the Swiss government
could locate him,

06:38.060 --> 06:40.756
he'd be facing years in prison
and millions in fines--

06:40.800 --> 06:43.462
which is presumably
why he's gone into hiding.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.469
But before he did,
he let certain...

06:46.500 --> 06:48.934
interested parties know that
he was willing to sell the list

06:48.970 --> 06:50.198
to the highest bidder.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.777
Individuals like
your new friends at Le Milieu,

06:52.810 --> 06:54.573
for example.
Oh, it's more than that.

06:54.610 --> 06:57.101
It's governments as well.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.618
Think of the money they'll
collect in penalties

06:59.650 --> 07:01.868
and back taxes
from corporations

07:01.920 --> 07:04.115
and citizens who've been
hiding their money.

07:04.150 --> 07:07.153
The list could be worth
billions to the US. alone.

07:07.190 --> 07:09.010
The men who took Watson...

07:09.060 --> 07:11.153
they want us to find
Mr. Norman and his list.

07:11.190 --> 07:12.896
Why?

07:12.930 --> 07:14.955
Their organization
has a number of accounts

07:15.000 --> 07:17.025
with Credit Versoix,
operated through proxies.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.196
Obviously.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.130
But why us?

07:20.170 --> 07:21.967
They don't know me.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.662
They know you're a restaurateur
and an oaf.

07:24.710 --> 07:27.008
Neither_ of us has
any connection to Norman.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.168
So what would possess them
to ask you and me to...

07:30.210 --> 07:32.974
This was your idea.

07:33.020 --> 07:36.171
I overheard some of them
discussmg Norman

07:36.220 --> 07:37.687
at Diogenes
the other day.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.689
And when they told me
tonight they had Joan,

07:40.720 --> 07:42.529
I tried to explain
she wasn't a threat.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.822
They wouldn't believe me.

07:43.860 --> 07:45.919
So you told them about me,
about what I do.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.552
You told them
I could find Norman.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.568
Well, it worked.

07:51.570 --> 07:53.162
They've given
us 48 hours.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.761
And once those
48 hours are up?

08:08.150 --> 08:10.141
(sighs)

08:13.890 --> 08:15.653
I know why you're upset.

08:15.690 --> 08:17.578
My very good friend
might be murdered

08:17.630 --> 08:18.824
by your very bad friends.

08:18.860 --> 08:21.158
Brilliant deduction,
Mycroft.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.919
You're not sure you can do
what needs to be done

08:23.970 --> 08:24.959
without her.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.992
This is more than just a case.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.036
Without her to keep you focused,
to keep you settled...

08:33.080 --> 08:36.538
Is that what you
think she is? Hmm?

08:36.580 --> 08:40.243
A simple counterbalance?

08:40.280 --> 08:43.818
I think she's the person
you love most in the world.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.949
I know I'm not her.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.820
Not even close.

08:56.830 --> 08:58.627
But I know you.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.304
Even after all these years,
I know you.

09:05.270 --> 09:09.036
And I can keep you on track.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.298
Maybe not as well as her,
but well enough.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.112
And I promise you,
I won't let you fail.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.255
After I'm done...

09:22.290 --> 09:24.758
after I have succeeded...

09:24.790 --> 09:26.348
you'll go to the police,

09:26.390 --> 09:28.597
you'll tell them everything
you know about Le Milieu.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.791
After that--

09:30.830 --> 09:34.288
if you haven't
gone to prison--

09:34.340 --> 09:37.662
you will extricate
yourself from my life.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.338
And from Watson's.

09:42.310 --> 09:43.868
Forever.

09:46.850 --> 09:49.011
Well, I see little point
in looking for clues

09:49.050 --> 09:51.314
to his current
whereabouts at his home.

09:51.350 --> 09:53.614
By now, his residence
would have been picked apart

09:53.660 --> 09:55.116
by various
government agencies--

09:55.160 --> 09:57.355
the CIA, MI Various,
MSS, GRU--

09:57.390 --> 09:59.324
a veritable alphabet
soup of spies.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.624
Then I guess we should
start with his office

10:01.660 --> 10:02.820
at Credit Versoix.

10:02.870 --> 10:06.397
The security there is
quite impressive, no?

10:06.430 --> 10:09.763
I mean, it would almost
be impossible to penetrate,

10:09.810 --> 10:11.630
even for a group like those.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.171
Whereas, you and I
have the ability

10:13.210 --> 10:14.632
to turn ourselves
into vapors

10:14.680 --> 10:16.841
and infiltrate
via the air vents.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.177
Well done, Mycroft.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.678
You are a fine
substitute for Watson.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.971
Think about it, Sherlock.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.317
You and I
don't need to be vapors

10:23.350 --> 10:24.647
to get into Credit Versoix.

10:26.420 --> 10:30.186
We need only be
our father's sons.

10:35.230 --> 10:38.393
Please. Please, help
yourselves, gentlemen.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.763
This arrangement's intended
only for this meeting.

10:44.910 --> 10:46.901
How not at all wasteful.

10:46.940 --> 10:50.341
(laughs) It's not every day
we get the chance to sit down

10:50.380 --> 10:52.974
with members of such
an influential family.

10:53.020 --> 10:57.309
Your father has a reputation
of being, uh, sui generis.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.386
My father is a Lovecraftian
horror who uses his money

10:59.420 --> 11:01.752
to bludgeon his way to
ever-more-obscene profits.

11:01.790 --> 11:04.327
And Credit Versoix is
the perfect banking partner

11:04.360 --> 11:08.251
for a man accustomed to_ the
aggresswe practice of busmess.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.097
Yes. Well parried.

11:10.130 --> 11:12.428
Unfortunately,
you're wasting your time.

11:12.470 --> 11:14.290
We have not,

11:14.340 --> 11:16.137
in spite of what Mycroft
told you on the phone,

11:16.170 --> 11:18.309
come here to discuss
making a large dep05it

11:18.340 --> 11:20.069
of our father's plunder.

11:20.110 --> 11:21.771
We have come to offer
my serwces

11:21.810 --> 11:23.141
as a consulting detective.

11:23.180 --> 11:26.775
(chuckles):
I don't understand.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.469
You're in pursuit of one
Pierce Norman.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.444
I will deliver him
and his purloined list to you

11:31.490 --> 11:33.788
and not to any of the other
interested parties.

11:33.820 --> 11:36.414
Should I call security?

11:36.460 --> 11:38.348
Not just yet.

11:38.390 --> 11:41.291
Mr. Hostetler,
please be aware,

11:41.330 --> 11:43.195
if you expel us,
I shall be forced

11:43.230 --> 11:46.324
to make your condition
known to every employee

11:46.370 --> 11:48.258
in your company directory.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.200
Uh, what condition?

11:50.240 --> 11:52.037
Your wedding ring is too tight,

11:52.070 --> 11:53.799
your hand betrays
a very slight tremor,

11:53.840 --> 11:55.307
and your breath smells
very faintly

11:55.340 --> 11:57.342
of an ov_er_-the-counter
antidiarrheal.

11:57.380 --> 12:00.019
Nausea, weight gain
and tremors.

12:00.050 --> 12:03.087
All side effects of the drugs
valproate and lurasidone.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.883
Now, I doubt a man could have
reached your position

12:04.920 --> 12:06.512
if he was schizophrenic,

12:06.550 --> 12:08.256
so I would venture
that you are being treated for

12:08.290 --> 12:09.484
rapid-cycling manic-depression.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.768
As you can see,
my brother's a deductive genius.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.927
His prowess
is not to be underestimated.

12:18.970 --> 12:22.428
He can be the instrument
of your salvation

12:22.470 --> 12:24.529
or your demise.

12:24.570 --> 12:27.937
You'll need to sign
non-disclosure agreements.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.872
After that, I...

12:31.910 --> 12:35.243
can have our head of security
share what we know so far.

12:40.490 --> 12:42.151
"Kurt Yoder."

12:42.190 --> 12:43.487
(sniffs)

12:43.530 --> 12:45.555
_ _ Your surname
is perilously close to "yodel."

12:45.590 --> 12:48.423
As a Swiss,
that must grow tiresome.

12:48.460 --> 12:51.520
It's a joke I don't allow
people to make twice.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.835
How ominous.

12:54.870 --> 12:56.394
I'm sorry,
I don't see a computer.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.135
Surely, we'll need
to look at that.

12:58.170 --> 13:00.536
No_rman _accessed the accounts
first thing Monday morning,

13:00.580 --> 13:03.174
then wiped it;
there's nothing to see.

13:03.210 --> 13:06.976
Oh, there's plenty
of things to see.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.011
This small bit of wrapper
from a nicotine patch;

13:09.050 --> 13:10.847
that's Norman trying to
give up smoking.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.312
This triptych--

13:12.350 --> 13:14.887
he fancies himself
a nature photographer.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.229
It's my business to
know what others don't.

13:17.260 --> 13:18.921
So I'll need to see
that computer

13:18.960 --> 13:20.393
so I can analyze
its contents.

13:20.430 --> 13:22.557
It's in storage.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.919
We'll get it for you.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.427
Hmm.

13:26.470 --> 13:28.199
You keep looking
at that plant.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.567
It's a Ficus benjamina.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.579
Popular choice in
decorative office greenery.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.908
Thrives even
when neglected.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.542
The Ficus is an
aggresswe grower;

13:38.580 --> 13:41.344
it'll strain the limits
of any container.

13:41.380 --> 13:42.916
But this one...

13:50.430 --> 13:53.297
This one seems stunted.

13:53.330 --> 13:55.525
As if...

13:55.560 --> 13:57.926
Hmm.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.436
A hiding place.

14:01.470 --> 14:03.461
Yes.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.637
MYCROFI':
A handheld game console.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.604
No external hard drive.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.006
Nothing on the storage
but a single game.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.109
Well, we've managed
to make our way

14:12.150 --> 14:13.617
behind the walls
of one of the most

14:13.650 --> 14:15.345
secretive institutions
on the planet...

14:15.380 --> 14:17.883
to learn that Pierce Norman
likes to hide the fact

14:17.920 --> 14:21.185
that he plays video games
when he should be working.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.359
It's useless.

14:23.390 --> 14:24.618
MYCROFI': Please
excuse my brother.

14:24.660 --> 14:26.582
He's under a great deal
of stress.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.621
Personal matter.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.867
(men shouting in French)

14:36.000 --> 14:37.467
What's happened?

14:37.510 --> 14:40.638
A colleague--
he hurt himself while working.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.568
He was shot.

14:42.610 --> 14:44.146
You're afraid he's
going to be arrested

14:44.180 --> 14:45.909
if you take him
to the hospital.

14:45.950 --> 14:47.679
Not your concern.
I used to be a doctor

14:47.720 --> 14:49.073
before I started working
for the police.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.588
I specialized in trauma.

14:51.620 --> 14:54.612
(man screaming, crying)

14:56.990 --> 14:59.185
(men speaking French)

15:01.960 --> 15:02.995
Right upper quadrant.

15:03.030 --> 15:04.463
I need you to
cut this shirt open.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.990
(panting rapidly)

15:07.670 --> 15:09.297
Okay.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.331
(men speaking French)

15:13.340 --> 15:14.602
You know him?

15:14.640 --> 15:16.608
My cousin.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.302
What's his name?
Jem.

15:19.350 --> 15:21.170
Yeah, well, he's gonna die
if we don't do something.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.983
We're gonna have to
clean his wound.

15:23.020 --> 15:24.612
We have to operate.

15:24.650 --> 15:25.617
(speaking French)

15:25.650 --> 15:28.312
So, are you planning to tell me
what you found?

15:28.360 --> 15:29.987
You saw something
in Norman's office.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.487
You_r tantrum _
was cla55ic misdirection--

15:32.530 --> 15:34.953
a tactic you've been wielding
since childhood.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.695
Best we avoid the topic
of our childhood.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.618
I'm barely speaking to you
as it is.

15:38.670 --> 15:40.160
There was something.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.998
(sighs)

15:43.040 --> 15:44.359
Oh, I don't have time
for this.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.002
Time for what?

15:46.040 --> 15:48.304
(tires screech)

15:48.340 --> 15:49.477
Don't tell them anything
about Watson.

15:49.510 --> 15:50.670
Let me do all the talking.

15:50.710 --> 15:51.677
What are you
talking about?

15:51.710 --> 15:53.143
Who are they?

15:55.180 --> 15:56.511
Agent McNally.

15:56.550 --> 15:58.609
You had people watching
Credit Versoix.

15:58.650 --> 16:00.982
Get in the car, please.

16:01.020 --> 16:02.681
Better for everyone if we don't

16:02.720 --> 16:04.256
have to render
you both unconSCIous.

16:04.290 --> 16:05.723
What's going on?

16:05.760 --> 16:06.681
I know this man.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.425
Mycroft, meet the NSA.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.223
NSA, this is Mycroft.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.707
HOLMES: Let's dispense
with the cat-and-mouse phase,

16:18.740 --> 16:20.298
if you don't mind.

16:20.340 --> 16:21.773
We're in a hurry.
I imagine you are as well.

16:21.810 --> 16:23.778
You know that we're in pursuit
of Pierce Norman,

16:23.810 --> 16:25.641
and you would like to know
what we've learned?

16:25.680 --> 16:27.409
Throw in the names of the people
you're working for,

16:27.450 --> 16:28.712
that should about cover it.

16:28.750 --> 16:29.739
Hmm.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.714
Your government must be
salivating over that list.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.786
All those _tax evaders
to squeeze like ripe grapes.

16:33.820 --> 16:35.219
The tax evaders

16:35.260 --> 16:37.080
are the least of our concern.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.690
We have reason to believe
that Credit Versoix

16:39.730 --> 16:41.721
has been in business
with so-called "charities"

16:41.760 --> 16:43.569
that actually fund terrorism.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.761
They're in bed with drug
cartels on three continents.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.030
"Reason to believe"?

16:48.070 --> 16:50.038
You've been spying
on our Swiss friends.

16:50.070 --> 16:51.799
Well, the Swiss are not friends.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.398
They're neutral.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.499
So who hired you?

16:55.540 --> 16:57.269
Think.

16:57.310 --> 17:00.279
Better to have the NSA as
a friend than the alternative.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.710
We are working for a government
friendly to your own.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.082
They're interested
in Norman's list,

17:06.120 --> 17:07.553
buttheylack
the intelligence resources

17:07.590 --> 17:08.818
to pursue it on their own.

17:08.860 --> 17:11.158
My brother and
I took the job

17:11.190 --> 17:13.829
on condition
that should we find the list,

17:13.860 --> 17:17.398
we will turn over copies to them
and to the United States.

17:17.430 --> 17:20.263
So functionally,
we're working for you.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.064
And considering we've been
on the job for, what,

17:23.110 --> 17:26.830
12 hours,
we know next to nothing.

17:26.870 --> 17:28.804
Well, I hope that's all true,

17:28.840 --> 17:31.206
because otherwise,
I'm gonna have to find a way

17:31.250 --> 17:32.842
to prosecute you for espionage.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.246
Is there anything else?

17:35.280 --> 17:37.840
Mycroft, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.586
I get a night off,

17:40.620 --> 17:42.611
I swear I'm gonna
finally try Diogenes.

17:42.660 --> 17:45.424
How do you know
I have a restaurant?

17:45.460 --> 17:46.757
Everybody knows about Diogenes.

17:46.790 --> 17:49.793
Amazing food,
interesting clientele.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.529
(phone ringing)

17:56.570 --> 17:57.639
Detective?

17:57.670 --> 17:59.137
BELL:
Yeah, hey, uh,

17:59.170 --> 17:59.829
Joan asked me to pull

17:59.870 --> 18:01.428
some Interpol files yesterday,

18:01.480 --> 18:03.175
then she never showed
to pick them up.

18:03.210 --> 18:04.609
Just want to make sure
she's okay.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.208
She's tip-top.
You want to speak to her?

18:06.250 --> 18:07.274
Nah,

18:07.320 --> 18:08.275
not if she's...

18:08.320 --> 18:09.378
Hello?

18:11.690 --> 18:14.181
My phone doesn't appear to be
working-- can I borrow yours?

18:16.820 --> 18:18.788
Was that really
necessary?

18:18.830 --> 18:21.424
That was the NSA. Hands.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.198
Exquisite timepiece;
shame it has to go.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.730
They didn't touch my watch.

18:30.770 --> 18:32.738
Better safe than sorry.

18:32.770 --> 18:34.704
We cannot allow the NSA
to monitor us.

18:34.740 --> 18:37.243
If they find Norman before we
do, we'll have no one to trade

18:37.280 --> 18:39.669
for Joan, and then your friends
at Le Milieu will kill her.

18:39.710 --> 18:41.314
We need to get back
to the brownstone.

18:41.350 --> 18:43.739
I've got urgent business
to attend to.

18:47.220 --> 18:49.552
The video game
Norman was playing--

18:49.590 --> 18:51.649
that's your urgent business?

18:51.690 --> 18:54.420
I am pursuing
our most important lead.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.190
It doesn't seem like you're
pursuing much of anything.

18:57.230 --> 18:59.698
Before I destroyed
Norman's gaming device,

18:59.730 --> 19:03.302
I noted that he'd logged
over 50 hours playing this game.

19:03.340 --> 19:06.229
During that time, he failed
to score a single point.

19:06.270 --> 19:09.205
He did, however,
spend quite a bit of time using

19:09.240 --> 19:11.276
the game's chat function.

19:11.310 --> 19:14.916
You think he was using it
to communicate?

19:14.950 --> 19:17.942
With only one other person--
a player by the name of...

19:17.990 --> 19:20.914
L-3-G-O, L-4-S-S-5.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.282
"Leg-o-Lass-five.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.197
So this person was,
what, an accomplice?

19:27.230 --> 19:29.949
Someone who helped Norman
compile the list?
Possibly.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.661
I memorized Norman's user name.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.839
From then, it was a simple case
of deducing his password.

19:33.870 --> 19:34.894
I am now logged in

19:34.940 --> 19:36.532
as Norman.

19:36.570 --> 19:39.539
There are several messages
from "Leg-o-Lass—five,"

19:39.570 --> 19:40.707
trying to ascertain
his whereabouts.

19:40.740 --> 19:41.968
I've responded to the last one,

19:42.010 --> 19:45.400
and now I'm just waiting
to hear back.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.682
I-I realized just now

19:50.720 --> 19:52.915
I've never actually apologized
for what's happened

19:52.950 --> 19:55.282
to Joan.

19:55.320 --> 19:59.552
My... role in the situation
is complicated, but I...

19:59.590 --> 20:02.923
How is it complicated?
It seems simple enough to me.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.828
Well, I... Ijust wanted
to let you know I'm sorry.

20:06.870 --> 20:09.896
If anything happened to Joan,
I'd never forgive myself.

20:09.940 --> 20:11.635
Well, that won't be an issue.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.537
If anything happens to Joan,
I will murder you.

20:15.580 --> 20:16.831
(phone ringing)

20:16.880 --> 20:18.279
That's the, uh...

20:18.310 --> 20:19.572
the disposable phone
you lent me.

20:19.610 --> 20:21.419
Gave the number
to the restaurant;

20:21.450 --> 20:23.987
they said they'd call regarding
some repairs to the kitchen.

20:24.020 --> 20:25.988
Excuse me.

20:26.020 --> 20:27.988
(phone continues ringing)

20:32.930 --> 20:34.488
Mycroft Holmes.

20:34.530 --> 20:36.521
BRITISH MAN:
How goes it?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.890
We may have a lead.

20:39.930 --> 20:41.739
We're doing our best,
considering the circumstances.

20:41.770 --> 20:43.408
Circumstances that
could have been avoided

20:43.440 --> 20:46.034
if you'd simply removed
your brother from New York

20:46.070 --> 20:48.277
as I recommended
a few months ago.

20:48.310 --> 20:50.949
"Simply"? I forget sometimes
you haven't met Sherlock.

20:50.980 --> 20:52.948
Listen, I can't stay
on the line.

20:52.980 --> 20:54.948
You've made a hash
of this, Holmes.

20:54.980 --> 20:58.689
But remember, long as I wind up
with Norman and his list,

20:58.720 --> 21:00.779
you may still get out of it.

21:00.820 --> 21:02.253
(line clicks)

21:07.460 --> 21:09.451
Mm, mm...
HOLMES:
Prepare to travel.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.968
We leave for Westchester County
in five minutes.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.069
Wh-What?

21:13.100 --> 21:14.761
While you indulged
in slumber,

21:14.800 --> 21:16.028
I connected
with Leg-o-Lass—five.

21:16.070 --> 21:17.799
I extracted quite a bit
of information

21:17.840 --> 21:18.966
pretending to be Norman.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.001
Leg-o-Lass,
as it turns out,

21:21.040 --> 21:24.339
is not Norman's partner
in extortion, but his lover.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.074
It also turns out

21:25.110 --> 21:26.805
that Leg-o-Lass is not--

21:26.850 --> 21:28.772
as the name would lead one
to assume-- a woman.

21:28.820 --> 21:31.311
His name is Deron--
he has a wife, two children,

21:31.350 --> 21:33.386
and a taste for unsavory men.
Yes, this is all

21:33.420 --> 21:35.718
very interesting,
but why are we going to see him?

21:35.760 --> 21:38.081
He thought you were Norman--
he clearly has no idea

21:38.130 --> 21:39.779
where the man is.

21:39.830 --> 21:41.798
He may have more information
than he knows he does.

21:41.830 --> 21:43.991
It's a common
enough affliction.

21:44.030 --> 21:46.669
MAN:
All right, first of all,

21:46.700 --> 21:47.997
it's not "Lego-o-Lass."

21:48.040 --> 21:50.508
It's "Legolas,"
like the elf from the movies.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.963
And the five on the end
is just an extra "S."

21:53.010 --> 21:55.035
Second thing is,
my wife will be home any minute.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.570
Got questions, ask them fast.

21:56.610 --> 21:58.043
How long have you
known Pierce Norman?

21:58.080 --> 21:59.809
Little over a year.

21:59.850 --> 22:02.045
We saw each other off and on,
mostly in the city.

22:02.080 --> 22:05.117
Has he been behaving
unusually lately?

22:05.150 --> 22:07.015
Was he making any travel plans?

22:07.050 --> 22:09.018
What?

22:09.060 --> 22:11.051
Joan asks questions
when you're out and about.

22:11.090 --> 22:12.125
I've seen it.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.422
She's a trained detective.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.394
You are a buffoon.

22:15.430 --> 22:17.967
Had he been
acting unusual?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.059
No. Nothing like that.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.068
May I ask how
you two met?

22:22.100 --> 22:24.102
We met on Discretion.

22:24.140 --> 22:26.062
It's an app.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.804
May I?

22:33.150 --> 22:35.118
Pierce Norman.

22:35.150 --> 22:37.038
Not much there.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.809
Yeah, you're right.

22:38.850 --> 22:40.147
When I look at this picture,

22:40.190 --> 22:43.079
all I see is the location
he may be hiding.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.155
The woods?

22:44.190 --> 22:47.125
No, not just any woods.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.128
This is the same location
he has on display in his office.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.765
He has four
separate photographs--

22:51.800 --> 22:53.995
all taken from nearly
this exact spot.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.962
All at different
times of the year.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.709
Does Mr. Norman have a house
that he frequents in upstate?

22:59.740 --> 23:01.537
Uh, there's a summer house.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.104
Belongs to a friend, I think.

23:03.140 --> 23:04.573
He's invited me
up there a few times.

23:04.610 --> 23:05.838
Do you have the address?

23:05.880 --> 23:06.847
Nah.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.074
Could never get away.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.884
I need you to print me a
copy of this photograph.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.478
And then we'll
be on our way.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.711
We'll know where
that house is soon enough.

23:16.760 --> 23:19.183
It's a simple matter
of perspective.

23:19.230 --> 23:20.720
MARCHEF:
He's quiet now.

23:20.760 --> 23:21.749
Jem.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.097
I think maybe he's, um...

23:23.130 --> 23:24.791
stable.

23:24.830 --> 23:26.161
(sighs)

23:26.200 --> 23:28.065
I made my incisions
with a box cutter

23:28.100 --> 23:30.193
and used_vodka as
an antiseptic.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.208
He's clean, but he's
far from stable.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.071
If you care about
that man at all,

23:34.110 --> 23:36.533
you'll take him
to a hospital.

23:36.580 --> 23:38.138
I didn't ask you for help.

23:38.180 --> 23:39.738
You insisted.

23:39.780 --> 23:41.213
He was dying.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.445
I want you to remember that,

23:43.490 --> 23:46.789
because if the time comes
and we don't have what we want,

23:46.820 --> 23:49.152
I am going to kill you.

23:53.260 --> 23:55.194
I'm impressed.

23:55.230 --> 23:57.494
I'll admit,
I was somewhat skeptical

23:57.530 --> 23:59.225
during the third hour
of the search.

23:59.270 --> 24:00.965
But now I'm impressed.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.867
As I said, it's all a
matter of perspective.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.470
That and angles.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.707
There's precisely
one spot on Earth

24:11.750 --> 24:13.172
with that exact view
of the Hudson,

24:13.210 --> 24:16.145
the jetty below and
the tree line on the other side.

24:16.180 --> 24:18.944
It was a simple
process of elimination.

24:49.650 --> 24:51.845
No one home.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.881
Norman's car
is outSIde.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.582
By the looks of it, it hasn't
been moved in some time.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.929
He might've gone for a hike.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.622
We could wait
till he gets back.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.529
What?

25:05.570 --> 25:07.959
You have the
intellectual tools

25:08.000 --> 25:09.968
to make simple
deductions.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.605
Your failure to apply them
in an energetic fashion

25:12.640 --> 25:16.030
is a constant source
of befuddlement.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.298
Look around you.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.272
Really...

25:20.310 --> 25:22.915
look around.

25:25.350 --> 25:27.079
Excuse me.

25:35.260 --> 25:37.228
This cushion's
been disturbed.

25:37.260 --> 25:38.295
There's scratches
on the floor.

25:38.330 --> 25:41.561
Dry blood?

25:41.600 --> 25:44.239
There may have been
some kind of scuffle.

25:44.270 --> 25:46.704
More than a
scuffle, I'd say.

25:46.740 --> 25:48.332
Those scratches
are drag marks.

25:48.380 --> 25:52.248
Someone pulled a heaw
object to this door.

26:16.770 --> 26:19.102
(sniffs)

26:43.970 --> 26:46.063
*

26:54.180 --> 26:57.104
MYCROFI':
That's Pierce Norman.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.904
We were supposed
to trade him for Joan.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.286
(Mycroft sighs)

27:12.760 --> 27:16.423
What is to be gained
in... sitting around?

27:16.460 --> 27:19.964
It's obvious someone got
to Norman before we did,

27:20.000 --> 27:23.663
killed him and made off
with the list.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.804
We need to devise
something to... do,

27:26.840 --> 27:28.307
not sit around.

27:28.340 --> 27:30.979
I am devising something to do.

27:31.010 --> 27:33.149
I'm thinking
about the most efficient way

27:33.180 --> 27:34.738
to sever a man's carotid artery.

27:34.780 --> 27:36.372
I'm wondering why,

27:36.420 --> 27:38.809
when half the world's criminals
wanted Pierce Norman dead,

27:38.850 --> 27:40.442
he was murdered
by someone he knew.

27:40.490 --> 27:44.085
And I'm reviewing my knowledge
of invertebrate zoology.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.382
It's all terribly
interesting,

27:46.430 --> 27:50.252
if one has the patience
to simply... pay attention.

27:50.300 --> 27:53.269
So there's no sign
of a break-in.

27:53.300 --> 27:56.098
And you think Norman
let his attacker in.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.938
That's how you know
they were acquainted.

27:58.970 --> 28:01.404
He was cut once and only once.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.431
Direct strike to the neck.

28:03.480 --> 28:07.405
The blade was then retracted
with a sharp twisting motion.

28:07.450 --> 28:10.886
All indicative...

28:10.920 --> 28:13.889
of a highly
trained attacker.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.223
What are you doing?

28:36.540 --> 28:38.246
Is that a cocoon?

28:38.280 --> 28:41.249
No, it's a coffin fly pupa.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.408
I noticed plenty of maggots,
which is hardly surprising.

28:44.450 --> 28:47.419
But this...

28:47.450 --> 28:49.350
this may be our salvation.

28:49.390 --> 28:51.358
It takes at least

28:51.390 --> 28:56.350
eight days for a fly
to go from an egg to a pupa.

28:56.400 --> 29:01.360
Which means Mr. Norman here
has been dead for over a week.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.937
But the data breach at
Credit Versoix was six days ago.

29:03.970 --> 29:05.335
Precisely.

29:05.370 --> 29:08.476
Mr. Norman here
is not a criminal.

29:08.510 --> 29:10.478
He's a victim.

29:10.510 --> 29:12.876
Someone with access
to his computer

29:12.910 --> 29:14.878
followed him here,
they murdered him,

29:14.920 --> 29:16.547
and then they used his files

29:16.580 --> 29:18.787
to compile their list.

29:18.820 --> 29:22.779
Pierce Norman was dead
before the files were stolen.

29:22.820 --> 29:24.788
He has been murdered and framed,

29:24.830 --> 29:27.287
in that order.

29:27.330 --> 29:31.061
So the person who stole the list
is still at large.

29:31.100 --> 29:34.297
If we can find them,

29:34.340 --> 29:36.991
we'll have someone
to trade for Joan.

29:37.040 --> 29:39.008
We need the names of anyone
who could possibly

29:39.040 --> 29:40.769
have had access to his computer.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.307
(doorbell rings)

29:43.340 --> 29:46.343
Quite certain
you're ready for this?

29:58.260 --> 30:01.149
Herr Yoder.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.998
Thank you so much
for coming to see us.

30:04.030 --> 30:06.897
Could have done it without
all this skulking about.

30:06.930 --> 30:09.865
Well, my brother and I
are quite unsure how to proceed.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.504
As the bank's head of security,

30:11.540 --> 30:13.906
we thought you were
the best person to consult.

30:13.940 --> 30:15.339
So you no
longer think

30:15.380 --> 30:17.177
Pierce_ Norma_n stole
our list of clients?

30:17.210 --> 30:19.576
That's correct. It was
someone else in5ide the company.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.248
Did you bring
the list of people

30:21.280 --> 30:23.544
who may have accessed
his computer?

30:23.580 --> 30:25.582
There. Now tell me
what you kn...
(Taser clicking)

30:25.620 --> 30:27.986
(grunting)

30:31.990 --> 30:33.582
(clicking)

30:44.670 --> 30:46.558
What are you doing?

30:46.610 --> 30:48.134
This is kidnapping.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.602
Before your journey
into unconsciousness,

30:49.640 --> 30:52.245
you asked my brother
and I what we knew.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.374
We know all.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.376
We've known it since
before we called you

30:57.420 --> 30:59.445
and asked you to
meet us here.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.219
You murdered Norman.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.216
Then you assembled
his list of clients

31:03.260 --> 31:04.659
and you took it to market.

31:04.690 --> 31:06.282
What?

31:06.330 --> 31:08.389
What's your proof?

31:08.430 --> 31:10.352
It's really not
terribly complicated.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.891
The only person at Credit
Versoix with military training

31:12.930 --> 31:15.899
and access to highly secure
accounts like Norman's

31:15.940 --> 31:17.999
was you, Herr Yoder.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.065
Every man in Switzerland
goes into the army.

31:20.110 --> 31:21.634
You have to do something.

31:21.680 --> 31:24.240
Your brother,
he's-he's insane.
Yes.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.249
That's always been a matter of
some debate within the family.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.077
Various experts
have been consulted,

31:29.120 --> 31:32.510
but an exact diagnosis
has proved elusive.

31:32.550 --> 31:34.984
It's true, military
service is compulsory

31:35.020 --> 31:36.419
for every man
in Switzerland.

31:36.460 --> 31:38.382
But most men complete
their basic training,

31:38.430 --> 31:41.194
then they serve a brief stint
in the reserves. You...

31:41.230 --> 31:44.688
qualified for and served
in an elite commando unit.

31:44.730 --> 31:47.096
FSK-17.

31:47.130 --> 31:49.997
I imagine hand-to-hand combat
was a particular emphasis.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.701
Blade work.

31:51.740 --> 31:53.059
That's not proof.

31:53.110 --> 31:55.499
And this is not
the World Court.

31:55.540 --> 31:58.008
My brother and I

31:58.050 --> 32:00.439
are satisfied
that you did it.

32:00.480 --> 32:04.348
And for your purposes,
that's really all that matters.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.085
Now,

32:06.120 --> 32:08.611
you stand between me

32:08.660 --> 32:12.528
and the recovery of
someone for whom I care

32:12.560 --> 32:15.950
with all the depth I am
capable of mustering.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.422
She is
remarkable in ways

32:20.470 --> 32:24.008
that you could
never imagine.

32:25.370 --> 32:28.373
I would trade your life for hers

32:28.410 --> 32:30.332
without a moment's thought.

32:30.380 --> 32:32.541
So...

32:32.580 --> 32:36.016
I am going to use
these devices on you...

32:38.050 --> 32:40.314
...until you tell me

32:40.350 --> 32:43.513
the location _of
your stolen list.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.688
I will harvest whatever amount
of your flesh is necessary

32:46.730 --> 32:48.755
to get what I want.
Do you understand me so far?

32:48.800 --> 32:51.121
You have to stop this madness.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.991
Answer my brother's question.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.996
See, the military
knows that

32:56.040 --> 32:59.669
every man will speak if the
correct tools are applied,

32:59.710 --> 33:02.076
right?

33:07.080 --> 33:10.072
So the only way for you to
influence this situation

33:10.120 --> 33:12.213
is to tell me what I
want to know right now,

33:12.250 --> 33:15.583
and deny me the pleasure
of extracting it from you.

33:15.620 --> 33:18.180
No? Okay, very well.

33:24.530 --> 33:26.293
Did you know
you can choke

33:26.330 --> 33:28.764
any extremity on
the human body?

33:28.800 --> 33:32.236
You simply need
to deny it owgen.

33:32.270 --> 33:36.138
It become quite useless
quite permanently

33:36.180 --> 33:37.772
very, very quickly.

33:37.810 --> 33:40.745
Say auf Wiedersehen
to your left hand,

33:40.780 --> 33:42.111
Herr Yoder.

33:49.490 --> 33:50.718
This particular
shade of purple

33:50.760 --> 33:52.785
sets in right before
the cells die permanently.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.193
Stop!

33:55.230 --> 33:56.629
It's on a hard drive.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.161
Uh, one of
those small ones.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.498
It's-it's in a compartment
in my car.

34:00.530 --> 34:02.760
(sobbing)

34:04.770 --> 34:06.761
(muttering in French, panting)

34:14.380 --> 34:16.848
He is talking like this.
What is the matter with him?

34:16.880 --> 34:18.438
WATSON:
He's probably in shock.

34:18.490 --> 34:20.082
He needs a hospital.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.087
Mademoiselle?

34:21.120 --> 34:22.587
It's okay.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.324
It's okay.

34:26.790 --> 34:27.825
Okay...

34:27.860 --> 34:29.452
Your time is
not long now.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.819
I would be
more worried.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.566
My friends will
come through.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.261
What happens after
that is up to you.

34:34.300 --> 34:35.790
Mm.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.831
You have a very strong
faith in your friends.

34:37.870 --> 34:40.430
The one I know,
he is not worth this.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.278
You're talking
about Mycroft.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.471
It seems you think
we forced him

34:47.510 --> 34:49.649
into doing
business with us.

34:49.680 --> 34:52.581
It did not
happen like that.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.281
He was short of money.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.413
He had a... a proposal

34:56.460 --> 34:59.258
to use his business
to help us move products.

34:59.290 --> 35:01.394
In return,
we give money.

35:01.430 --> 35:04.297
The expansion to New York--
his idea.

35:04.330 --> 35:07.128
Why are you telling
me all this?

35:07.170 --> 35:09.195
Maybe I think
you should know the truth

35:09.240 --> 35:11.231
before we give you
back to him.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.674
You should know
the truth before.

35:20.350 --> 35:24.218
MYCROFI': Some of
these names, remarkable.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.241
Yoder certainly
gathered himself

35:26.290 --> 35:28.178
a valuable trove
of information.

35:28.220 --> 35:29.414
I'm sure,
under different circumstances,

35:29.460 --> 35:30.859
_ it would be _
fascmating to reVIew,

35:30.890 --> 35:33.859
but right now, all we need
to know is that it's real.

35:33.890 --> 35:35.494
We've got the list.

35:35.530 --> 35:36.895
Where's the phone?

35:36.930 --> 35:38.158
Who are you calling?

35:38.200 --> 35:40.191
Agent McNally of the NSA.

35:40.230 --> 35:41.766
What on earth for?

35:41.800 --> 35:43.495
Mycroft, you've shown
yourself to be capable

35:43.540 --> 35:44.905
of rudimentary deduction.

35:44.940 --> 35:47.431
And you know these people.
Surely you must realize that

35:47.470 --> 35:49.574
as soon as we hand over
the list, they Will murder

35:49.610 --> 35:51.749
you, me and Joan.
Yoder, as well--

35:51.780 --> 35:53.338
not that I'm particularly
concerned about that.

35:53.380 --> 35:55.575
I've been done business
With these people for years.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.178
They're always
as good as their word.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.518
Heading into this meeting
without proper support

35:59.550 --> 36:01.586
would be utter folly.

36:01.620 --> 36:03.451
McNally has access
to trained men.

36:03.490 --> 36:05.253
He will also understand

36:05.290 --> 36:06.928
that we needed to color
outside the lines

36:06.960 --> 36:09.258
to get the information
that we needed from Yoder.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.927
I don't think this is wise.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.518
We've done everything
they've asked.

36:12.570 --> 36:14.765
Well, considering it was
your criminally poor judgment

36:14.800 --> 36:16.836
which resulted in Joan's
abduction in the first place,

36:16.870 --> 36:18.758
let's dispense
with that foolishness

36:18.810 --> 36:20.869
and approach the situation
the smart way.

36:20.910 --> 36:22.377
My way.

36:22.410 --> 36:23.707
(dialing)

36:29.980 --> 36:31.743
(Taser clicking)

36:52.410 --> 36:55.732
(dialing)

36:55.780 --> 36:57.771
(line ringing)

36:59.880 --> 37:01.939
BRITISH MAN:
Tell me you've made progress.

37:01.980 --> 37:04.244
I have Kurt Yoder.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.917
And the list.

37:05.950 --> 37:07.941
I'm on my way to you now.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.791
It's Jem.
Something is wrong.

37:23.540 --> 37:24.268
It's thready.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.538
What is it?
What is happening?

37:25.570 --> 37:26.832
He's bleeding internally.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.838
The bullet must have
nicked his liver.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.836
Ah. Fix it.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.006
I told you, he needs surgery--

37:32.050 --> 37:33.574
real surgery,
in a real hospital.

37:33.610 --> 37:34.770
No. (chuckles)

37:34.820 --> 37:36.970
You think if we take
him to a hospital,

37:37.020 --> 37:39.614
he will tell them where
you are. He won't.

37:39.650 --> 37:43.518
If you want your cousin to live,
take him to the hospital.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.858
Otherwise, keep him here
and watch him die.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.624
(gasps)

37:49.660 --> 37:51.662
(exclaims)

37:51.700 --> 37:53.691
(Joan panting)

37:55.900 --> 37:59.336
(phone ringing)

37:59.370 --> 38:01.838
(speaks French)

38:03.810 --> 38:05.801
Monsieur de Soto.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.011
Oui. Je comprends.

38:12.820 --> 38:14.651
It's good news.

38:14.690 --> 38:17.682
Your friend and his brother
came through.

38:17.720 --> 38:20.325
The exchange is on.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.598
I love this.

38:24.630 --> 38:26.723
You lie to me the other day
about everything,

38:26.770 --> 38:28.931
and now you expect me
to help save your partner.

38:28.970 --> 38:32.599
I expect nothing. I'm appealing
to your sense of decency.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.471
And what about your buddies
at the NYPD?

38:34.510 --> 38:36.375
Why don't you appeal
to their sense of decency?

38:36.410 --> 38:38.901
The NSA has
superior resources.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.714
And a greater familiarity
with the problem at hand.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.911
You mean "problems"
with an "S," right?

38:43.950 --> 38:45.588
Now that the list is gone,

38:45.620 --> 38:47.713
your brother double-crossed you,
your partner is in the hands

38:47.750 --> 38:49.058
of some very, very bad guys.

38:50.490 --> 38:52.583
Are you going to
assist me or not?

38:52.630 --> 38:54.552
I would love to assist you.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.692
I need that list, too.

38:55.730 --> 38:57.550
Your brother's in the wind.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.091
Your best hope
is that he was right.

39:00.130 --> 39:02.735
That he can pull off
the trade by himself.

39:02.770 --> 39:05.762
You're assuming
he even intends

39:05.810 --> 39:07.835
to make the trade.

39:07.870 --> 39:10.634
You think he cut a deal
with somebody else?

39:10.680 --> 39:12.409
That he gave
the list to them?

39:12.450 --> 39:13.906
I thought I knew
my brother.

39:13.950 --> 39:15.770
His many flaws
of character.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.709
It turns out, there may
be more than I realized.

39:18.750 --> 39:22.379
I am begging you.

39:22.420 --> 39:25.127
Please, help
me find him.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.685
I'll tell my people
to keep their eyes peeled.

39:27.730 --> 39:29.721
That's the best I can do.

39:29.760 --> 39:33.764
Then you wont mind if
I do go to the NYPD.

39:38.170 --> 39:40.934
Your friend is late.

39:44.780 --> 39:47.840
(speaking French)

40:06.170 --> 40:07.762
Monsieur de Soto.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.928
I apologize for the delay.

40:10.970 --> 40:13.063
You have what we asked for?

40:13.110 --> 40:14.839
In the boot.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.495
That is not Norman.

40:37.530 --> 40:39.498
Norman is dead.

40:39.530 --> 40:41.066
He's been dead
for over a week.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.833
That's the man
who stole the list.

40:44.870 --> 40:47.839
If you like, I can show you
where to find the body.

40:50.910 --> 40:52.901
You brought
the list as well?

40:59.790 --> 41:01.849
MYCROFT:_I want to thank
you again, GUIllaume,

41:01.890 --> 41:03.482
for this opportunity.

41:03.520 --> 41:05.886
As I told you,
she works for the police,

41:05.930 --> 41:07.921
but she poses no threat to you.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.525
Kill them.

41:15.770 --> 41:17.738
Guillaume,

41:17.770 --> 41:19.499
mistakes have been
made, I confess,

41:19.540 --> 41:20.768
but I'm begging you,
don't make another one.

41:22.310 --> 41:24.744
There are lines. You know this.

41:24.780 --> 41:28.045
I've been an excellent partner
to your organization.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.742
I've done everything
you've always asked of me.

41:30.780 --> 41:33.988
All good things, mon ami.

41:37.790 --> 41:39.883
(engine starts)

41:51.200 --> 41:53.760
You're certain
there's nothing I can do

41:53.810 --> 41:55.698
to talk you out of this?

41:55.740 --> 41:57.799
Sorry.

41:57.840 --> 42:01.719
Then would you do me the favor
of allowing me a few last words?

42:05.350 --> 42:06.942
Paint it black.

42:06.990 --> 42:07.888
Pardon?

42:07.920 --> 42:09.888
(gunfire)

42:09.920 --> 42:12.821
(tires screeching)

42:14.860 --> 42:16.088
(British accent):
Command, this is A-16.

42:16.130 --> 42:17.199
We are all clear.

42:17.230 --> 42:19.221
I repeat, all clear.

42:19.270 --> 42:21.568
You squared, sir?

42:34.080 --> 42:36.173
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Joan.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.347
Obviously, there's a great deal
I need to tell you.
