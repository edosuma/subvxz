WEBVTT

00:38.747 --> 00:40.040
Don't forget these.

00:45.628 --> 00:46.588
Thanks, buddy.

00:49.007 --> 00:53.511
-You want to put your shoes on for me?
-How far is New Jersey from Florida?

00:54.471 --> 00:56.556
About two days in the car, but…

00:57.474 --> 01:00.143
-Are you gonna suddenly become--
-He's my son!

01:01.102 --> 01:02.520
He doesn't want us to go.

01:04.814 --> 01:06.107
I know.

01:08.777 --> 01:09.903
You okay?

01:10.862 --> 01:11.738
Yeah.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.741
But, um…

01:16.534 --> 01:20.497
Your dad and I were talking, and, um,

01:21.581 --> 01:26.628
we think maybe it's better
if Rose and I get settled first,

01:26.711 --> 01:28.963
and then bring you out to New Brunswick.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.007
What?

01:33.218 --> 01:34.260
We can't leave him.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.763
I'm not going with you?

01:36.846 --> 01:38.640
Not this trip, sweetie.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.100
Dad promised.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.310
He changed his mind.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.606
He said he'd miss you too much.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.316
I'm gonna go talk to him.

01:48.399 --> 01:49.359
Rose.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.571
He's not in a listening mood.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.157
He's just doing this out of spite.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.909
What happened to shared custody?

01:58.660 --> 02:01.538
I can't take Jed
without your dad's permission.

02:03.665 --> 02:07.710
Say goodbye to your brother
and wait for me in the car, okay?

02:16.719 --> 02:17.804
I love you, Jeddy.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.764
Take me with you.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.937
Okay, let's get you unpacked, baby.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.899
Rose, please.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.151
I'm sorry.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.991
-Rose! Rose!
-Jed, it's okay. It's okay, baby.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.331
Are you there, my sister?

02:52.338 --> 02:55.133
Will you talk to me, Queen of Despair?

02:56.843 --> 02:59.429
I'm always ready
to listen to you, Desire.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.599
I have news.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.352
Real news?

03:08.229 --> 03:10.064
The Prodigal has returned?

03:10.148 --> 03:11.357
What?

03:12.567 --> 03:14.861
Oh. Him?

03:14.944 --> 03:16.613
No, no, he's still missing.

03:17.780 --> 03:20.033
I speak of Dream.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.412
He's managed to free himself.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.292
You seek to snare him
in your machinations again?

03:31.836 --> 03:34.672
Has he not suffered enough
these last 100 years?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.090
Well, you would think so.

03:36.174 --> 03:40.261
But he's just as smug
and self-important as ever.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.225
Do you think these little games of ours
will change him?

03:47.310 --> 03:49.020
This is no game, my twin.

03:49.646 --> 03:54.317
Dream still behaves
as if his realm is superior to ours.

03:55.485 --> 04:00.949
It's time that he learned that dreams
are merely echoes of desire and despair.

04:03.117 --> 04:07.413
Whatever this new scheme is,
it won't work.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.583
It didn't last time
or the time before that.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.710
Nada was a mistake.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.713
And Roderick Burgess was a diversion.

04:17.090 --> 04:22.345
But things have changed, my love, my twin.

04:25.181 --> 04:27.308
There is a dream vortex.

04:27.392 --> 04:33.439
The first for a long time
and… it is a woman.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.991
-So we wait?
-We won't have to wait.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.494
The girl has no idea what she is,

04:46.577 --> 04:50.498
but she is already doing what vortexes do.

04:51.833 --> 04:55.378
Bringing in everything
and everyone to her.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.797
Including Morpheus.

04:57.880 --> 04:58.965
Who is she?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.926
The woman who will be Dream's undoing?

05:03.886 --> 05:05.638
Her name is Rose.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.309
Rose Walker.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.019
-Rose?

05:11.769 --> 05:14.522
-Lyta. I found a new photo of Jed.
-What?

05:14.605 --> 05:17.108
-Well, not new. New to me.
-Hello?

05:17.984 --> 05:21.612
Miss Bloom? Hi, it's Rose Walker.
Miranda's daughter?

05:21.696 --> 05:22.905
The car's on its way.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.616
Sorry to bother you,
but I was going through my mom's stuff--

05:25.700 --> 05:27.618
Carl, what are you doing here?

05:27.702 --> 05:29.662
I asked if I could
house-sit while you're gone.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.832
I found a photo of my brother Jed
that I've never seen before.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.418
-Uh…
-She'll need shoes with that.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.379
From before the divorce,
so it's at least seven years old,

05:38.463 --> 05:41.090
but you can see his face
really clearly in it.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.633
Can I send it to you?

05:44.218 --> 05:47.722
When… the foster agent
wouldn't tell us where she placed Jed,

05:47.805 --> 05:50.141
you said we could hire
a private investigator.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.687
Well, I assumed my mom's estate
would cover the cost.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.232
Oh.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.489
No, I fully intend to pay your bill. Um…

06:04.572 --> 06:06.366
Just the minute I find a job.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.369
You're not hiring by any chance, are you?

06:11.079 --> 06:11.913
No?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.500
Okay. Thank you for your time.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.840
There's no money left?

06:24.175 --> 06:26.928
She said Mom spent it all
on the apartment.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.971
She wanted you to have a home.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.600
She wanted Jed to have a home too.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.938
We have to go.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.649
-I don't think I can.
-Rosie.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.318
How can I leave the country
when I have no money, no job--

06:42.402 --> 06:46.531
Listen to me. If people are paying you
to be somewhere, that is a job.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.866
And this foundation
is paying you to fly to London.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.076
They're not paying me.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.912
Your per diem is £250 a day.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.872
In cash. For seven days.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.917
In exchange
for one family history interview.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.089
-Business class?
-Yeah.

07:03.172 --> 07:05.341
This foundation really wants to meet you.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.093
It's not me they want to meet.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.220
It was my mom.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.516
She was so looking forward to this.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.146
I'm a poor substitute, I know.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.106
No. Thank you for coming with me.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.109
I had no choice. Your mom insisted.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.571
And I'm very glad she did.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.118
It does get easier, right?

07:33.077 --> 07:37.373
You don't still think about Hector
every second of every day, do you?

07:40.751 --> 07:41.794
Champagne?

07:42.545 --> 07:43.588
Thank you.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.048
-Thank you.
-Here.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.760
Because, as my husband
and your mom would tell us,

07:49.844 --> 07:52.722
life is too short
not to enjoy business class.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.478
Have you heard about the vortex?

07:59.604 --> 08:01.647
-Everyone's talking about it.
-Everyone?

08:01.731 --> 08:04.108
Who's everyone, exactly?

08:04.192 --> 08:06.527
Well, Cain mostly, but--

08:06.611 --> 08:11.908
Abel, if I wanted to hear silly
hedge-gossip about… swirling entities,

08:11.991 --> 08:13.576
I would've asked you for it.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.580
But I'm here conducting a census
for Lord Morpheus now that he's back.

08:17.663 --> 08:22.335
Now, I'll need a complete list
of all entities residing here.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.337
Okay. Let me have a think. Um…

08:25.588 --> 08:27.006
-There's me.
-Hmm.

08:27.089 --> 08:29.467
And the House of Secrets itself obviously.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.843
And the Bottle Imp.

08:30.927 --> 08:34.972
And, um… something unspeakably nasty
in the basement.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.350
Something nasty in the basement.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.852
I try not to go down there. And…

08:41.354 --> 08:43.814
I seem to have
inadvertently omitted my friend.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.358
It's called Goldie.

08:45.441 --> 08:49.237
One new addition.
A baby gargoyle called Goldie.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.448
So, does Lord Morpheus know about the…

08:54.242 --> 08:55.326
…vortex?

08:55.409 --> 08:56.661
I can assure you,

08:56.744 --> 09:01.499
Lord Morpheus has better things to do
than listen to foolish rumors.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.798
Maybe a trip to England
is exactly what she needs.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.343
She's sleeping. So, that's progress.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.471
-She hasn't been sleeping?
-No.

09:16.764 --> 09:20.810
She's been dealing with her mom's estate,
trying to find her brother.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.186
Doing whatever she has to do

09:22.270 --> 09:25.648
to keep from thinking about the fact
that she's all alone now.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.651
She's not though.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.488
No, I know.
And friends are great, but, uh…

09:35.283 --> 09:36.117
What?

09:40.538 --> 09:43.249
When you lose your parents,
you suddenly realize

09:44.542 --> 09:47.461
it wasn't gravity
keeping you on the ground all this time.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.841
It was knowing you were
someone's daughter. Or sister.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.886
Or wife, in my case.

09:57.263 --> 10:01.183
I'm sorry. How are you? Are you okay?

10:02.852 --> 10:04.645
Probably not, no.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.522
Why do you say that?

10:08.441 --> 10:11.569
'Cause instead of being back at work,
I'm on a plane to London,

10:12.486 --> 10:13.988
talking to my dead husband.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.536
Ma'am? Ma'am?

10:25.833 --> 10:28.919
Sorry to wake you.
Would you mind fastening your seat belt?

10:29.837 --> 10:30.713
Thank you.

10:53.694 --> 10:56.697
I have completed the census
you requested, Lord Morpheus.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.075
Good. And?

10:59.158 --> 11:03.287
I have accounted for 11,062 of them.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.456
Wow. Someone's been busy.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.624
Yes. Well…

11:07.541 --> 11:09.377
There are a handful of new entities.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.212
That is to be expected.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.882
But… three of the Major Arcana are gone.

11:17.551 --> 11:18.469
Name them.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.389
The first is Gault.

11:24.975 --> 11:28.062
A Nightmare who,
I must say, I never trusted.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.731
She is a shape-changer.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.983
It is not in her nature to be trustworthy.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.236
Who else?

11:36.821 --> 11:37.863
The Corinthian.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.034
I assumed as much.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.037
Still feeding on the dreamers
he was meant to serve.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.581
-Yes.
-The last?

11:48.499 --> 11:50.084
The last is Fiddler's Green.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.295
-Fiddler's Green?
-Hmm.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.718
That is passing strange.

12:00.845 --> 12:04.390
He is, after all, vavasor of
his own dominion and always so reliable.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.516
I know.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.605
This is my fault.
Had I been here, fulfilling my function--

12:11.689 --> 12:14.150
-It was not your fault, my lord.
-No?

12:15.443 --> 12:16.819
Then whose?

12:18.988 --> 12:21.407
I'm afraid there is yet more news.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.910
-Gossip, really, but…
-Go on.

12:26.370 --> 12:31.208
There are rumors
among the dream folk… of a vortex.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.253
Perhaps you might wish to investigate.

12:37.381 --> 12:40.509
The rumors are quite true.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.262
There is a vortex.

12:43.345 --> 12:47.475
A true annulet. The first of this era.

12:47.558 --> 12:51.270
Then you must hunt for it, sir.
It must be controlled.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.360
The vortex is a she, Lucienne.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.196
Not an "it."

13:01.197 --> 13:04.575
And the Endless are forbidden
from taking action against any mortal

13:04.658 --> 13:06.452
who is not an active threat.

13:06.535 --> 13:09.079
Yes, but should the threat become active?

13:09.163 --> 13:13.501
Then perhaps one of our problems
may prove a solution to the other three.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.296
She is a vortex, after all.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.342
Sooner or later,
she will draw the stray dreams to her.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.304
Is that not risky, Lord?

13:25.387 --> 13:29.308
She could destroy the Dreaming.
And the waking world in the process.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.478
-I'm watching her.
-Yes, but only when she sleeps.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.940
Perhaps one of us should
surveil her in the waking world.

13:36.023 --> 13:40.194
I think it best I not leave
the Dreaming unattended for now.

13:40.778 --> 13:41.987
I could go.

13:43.322 --> 13:47.243
Very well. Lucienne will tell you
what to look for, Matthew.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.872
And what you see, I too will see.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.792
Rose?

13:56.794 --> 13:57.711
Wake up.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.005
We're here.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.134
I just had the weirdest dream.

14:08.097 --> 14:08.931
Thank you.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.020
Miss Walker.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.772
Hi. I'm Rose.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.233
I'm Lyta Hall.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.443
Are you the attorney? Mr. Holdawell?

14:21.527 --> 14:22.736
It's Holdaway, miss.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.071
Sorry.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.324
And we call ourselves "solicitors"
on this side of the Atlantic.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.660
Is this the foundation headquarters?

14:29.743 --> 14:32.663
This is a private care home
for the elderly.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.999
My client is a resident.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.584
Shall we go in?

14:44.258 --> 14:45.426
If you'll follow me.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.602
Your client runs the foundation?

14:54.685 --> 14:58.105
My client will explain everything
much better than I can, Miss Hall.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.483
Do you know what an annulet is?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.485
-A what?
-An annulet.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.322
It's a kind of ring, I believe. Old word.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.199
Where did such a young girl
run across such an old word?

15:09.283 --> 15:11.493
I'm not that young. I'm actually 21.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.537
No one ever believes me.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.206
And they always
ask to see my ID, it's annoying.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.417
What's annoying is when they stop asking.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.627
Trust me.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.719
-Come in, please.

15:32.890 --> 15:33.891
Thank you.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.144
You must be Rose.

15:37.227 --> 15:40.022
I am. And this is my friend, Lyta Hall.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.900
It's a pleasure to meet you both.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.654
My name is Unity. Unity Kincaid.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.740
-Thank you, Mr. Holdaway.
-Not at all.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.704
He's very serious, isn't he?

15:56.872 --> 15:58.582
Please, come in.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.627
Thank you. Ooh.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.046
-Whose is this?
-Oh, that was mine when I was a girl.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.301
It looks brand-new.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.470
It might as well be.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.014
I didn't get a chance to play with it.

16:14.723 --> 16:15.849
Why not?

16:15.933 --> 16:17.893
Well, that's why you're here actually.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.981
The doll's house was a gift.
For my 12th birthday.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.778
The doctors tell me
that on that night, I fell ill

16:27.861 --> 16:30.739
with something called
encephalitis lethargica.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.283
Rise and shine, dormouse.

16:33.367 --> 16:36.745
I fell asleep,
and I didn't wake up.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.957
Luvvy? Unity?

16:42.209 --> 16:43.627
Until eight months ago.

16:44.378 --> 16:49.133
But in my dreams,
I had the most glorious life.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.469
I took over my father's business.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.847
And I met a man with golden eyes.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.515
And we had a baby.

16:58.642 --> 17:02.187
But it wasn't until I woke up
that I found out that none of it was real.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.567
Except for the baby.

17:08.277 --> 17:12.114
Apparently,
while I was asleep in hospital,

17:13.407 --> 17:14.783
I had a baby girl.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.872
They hushed it up at the time,
but Mr. Holdaway found out

17:19.955 --> 17:22.291
that she was adopted by a fine family.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.960
And that she grew up
to have a daughter of her own.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.755
Called Miranda.

17:29.798 --> 17:31.216
Miranda Walker.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.053
Your mother.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.931
I'm your great-grandmother, Rose.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.852
And I'm sorry to have
brought you here under false pretenses,

17:41.935 --> 17:45.481
but I thought that if it were explained
to you first, you might not have…

17:45.564 --> 17:46.774
You might not have come.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.986
And I don't think I could have borne that.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.449
Oh.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.916
I'll let you catch up.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.418
-No. You don't have to--
-No, please stay.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.213
I'll come back. You two talk.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.600
Thank you both
for coming all this way,

18:21.683 --> 18:24.436
but as co-chairs
of the planning committee,

18:24.520 --> 18:29.399
it falls to us to come up with
a suitable replacement for the Family Man.

18:29.483 --> 18:33.362
So, we need a new guest of honor.
Immediately, if not sooner.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.031
Do we have any other big names coming?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.992
-Um, Moon River.
-Mmm, no.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.869
Uh, the Candyman.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.623
Uh, we need a marquee player.
People have already bought tickets.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.375
Not as many people as last year.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.001
All the more reason to go big.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.755
Who's the one person we'd all pay to see?

18:54.383 --> 18:56.051
-The Corinthian.
-Yeah.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.472
I reach out every year. No response.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.562
No.

19:06.645 --> 19:07.938
Thank you.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.734
How old do you think he is?

19:12.818 --> 19:13.694
The Corinthian?

19:13.777 --> 19:16.405
Oh. He's been around for forever.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.740
No, the waiter.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.369
Sixteen? Seventeen?

19:23.620 --> 19:24.538
Too old for you.

19:25.873 --> 19:26.999
He looks younger.

19:27.082 --> 19:30.294
Though there's probably been
more than one Corinthian over the years.

19:30.377 --> 19:34.464
Whoever the current one is,
his work is exquisite.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.676
This was last week. In DC.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.847
-Oh.
-Oh.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.808
So he's on the East Coast. He's not far.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.394
What do you think he does with the eyes?

19:47.477 --> 19:49.771
He's a collector. Same as us.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.859
I can invite him again
through the usual channels.

19:53.942 --> 19:58.447
No, if we want to get his attention,
we have to think like him.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.700
Act… like him.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.329
Are you suggesting we--

20:05.412 --> 20:07.206
Copycat the Corinthian?

20:07.289 --> 20:08.415
Might be fun.

20:08.498 --> 20:11.043
We do not plagiarize one another's work.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.502
We have a code.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.964
We also have over 100
serial killers coming to this thing.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.633
"Collectors." Please.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.427
And they paid good money
to see the Family Man.

20:20.510 --> 20:23.263
No. Absolutely not.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.517
Fine. Have it your way.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.480
Restroom?

20:37.277 --> 20:39.696
Do you think the Corinthian has a type?

20:43.909 --> 20:44.826
May I help you?

20:45.410 --> 20:47.162
Oh, you're not Rose Walker.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.456
No, I'm Carl.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.875
Rose's roommate?

20:51.959 --> 20:54.127
House-sitter. She's away.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.379
Ah.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.589
And you are?

20:57.673 --> 21:00.133
I guess you could say
I'm kind of a headhunter.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.927
Here to offer Rose a job.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.555
-Seriously?
-Do you know where I can find her?

21:06.139 --> 21:06.974
Uh…

21:07.057 --> 21:10.602
She's traveling at the moment,
but I can give her a message.

21:11.311 --> 21:14.189
Hmm. Yeah, how long
do you think she'll be away?

21:15.399 --> 21:16.275
A week.

21:17.067 --> 21:20.112
But… you're welcome to wait.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.409
The Corinthian's technique
is meticulous.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.368
Elegant.

21:27.035 --> 21:30.122
A convincing collection
would take months of research.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.665
We'd need the right tools.

21:31.748 --> 21:35.168
Plus, why would the Corinthian
even care about a copycat?

21:35.252 --> 21:36.295
Well, I'd care.

21:36.378 --> 21:38.964
If someone was out there
taking credit for my work,

21:39.840 --> 21:44.428
I'd find them and I'd make sure
they never did it again.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.306
That's another good reason not to do it.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.558
Right. That settles it.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.351
-We've decided--
-We need to go.

21:52.311 --> 21:56.231
We can't go. We have no guest of honor
and no plan moving forward.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.442
I want dessert. Where's the waiter?

21:58.525 --> 21:59.651
We have a plan.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.904
We are sending a message
to the Corinthian.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.824
And the waiter isn't coming back.

22:10.620 --> 22:11.830
Whoa.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.377
I'll just get Lyta. Be right back.

22:22.549 --> 22:23.592
Rose.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.302
Rosebud.

22:25.385 --> 22:27.429
Rose Walker.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.645
Hello, Rosie.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.190
Come in, my butterfly.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.984
You are at a crossroads, Rose Walker.

22:42.277 --> 22:45.197
How do you know my name? Who are you?

22:45.280 --> 22:47.657
Names, names, names.

22:47.741 --> 22:50.786
Each name
is but a single aspect of the whole.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.330
Be satisfied
with the trinity you have, love.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.916
You wouldn't want to
meet us as the Kindly Ones.

22:55.999 --> 22:58.919
We can only caution you, sister.

22:59.002 --> 23:00.670
We can't protect you.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.464
Protect me from…

23:02.547 --> 23:03.965
From life, my posy.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.635
And the things that hover beyond life.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.512
Thrashing theirselves against it.

23:08.595 --> 23:11.932
-Beware dreams.
-And houses.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.184
What do you mean?

23:14.267 --> 23:16.561
You ask the wrong question.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.688
Had you asked the right one,

23:18.772 --> 23:21.149
we could have warned you
against the Corinthian.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.901
Told you about Jed.

23:22.984 --> 23:25.320
And about Morpheus.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.578
What are you doing in here?

23:34.287 --> 23:35.247
I…

23:40.669 --> 23:43.088
I think I'm really jet-lagged.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.346
How do you two know each other?

23:51.430 --> 23:54.474
-We're neighbors, actually.
-Same building. One floor apart.

23:54.558 --> 23:59.062
And when my mom got sick,
Lyta and her husband basically adopted me.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.149
We felt like Rose adopted us.

24:02.232 --> 24:05.610
Which makes you
and your husband my family too.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.948
Should I send him
a plane ticket so he can join us?

24:10.699 --> 24:15.120
That's very sweet of you,
but… Hector passed away about a year ago.

24:15.203 --> 24:16.204
Oh, no.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.582
It was an accident.
Someone ran a red light.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.917
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't be.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.878
Hector and I met in college.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.963
We were architecture majors.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.424
We opened our own firm.
We had years together.

24:28.383 --> 24:30.343
But it's never enough years though, is it?

24:31.678 --> 24:35.515
It seems we've all had our lives
terribly interrupted, haven't we?

24:36.433 --> 24:39.811
Maybe that's what life is.
Just a series of interruptions.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.314
And reconnections.

24:44.399 --> 24:47.527
Now, we just need to locate your brother.

24:47.611 --> 24:51.156
I was hoping, uh,
to hire a private investigator.

24:51.239 --> 24:54.493
Or maybe go down to
Cape Kennedy myself at some point.

24:54.576 --> 24:55.619
Well, I think you should.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.620
I will.

24:56.703 --> 24:59.581
Uh, I just need to find a job first.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.875
What if I employ you?

25:02.501 --> 25:03.543
To do what?

25:03.627 --> 25:05.754
To locate my great-grandson.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.382
Look, I'll pay for everything.
Travel. Expenses.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.343
And a salary, of course.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.762
-Unity, I--
-Don't worry.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.055
There's plenty of money.

25:15.722 --> 25:18.975
Our family owned Kincaid Sugar.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.894
-They did?
-Oh, my God.

25:20.977 --> 25:25.482
You'd be doing me a favor.
I want to meet my great-grandson.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.984
Lyta, will you go with her?

25:28.068 --> 25:29.110
Let's all go.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.488
No, no, no. I'd only slow you down.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.616
But I'll be with you in spirit.

25:35.575 --> 25:37.077
No. No, more than that.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.331
My parents gave me this a long time ago.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.294
It's yours now.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.757
Thank you.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.133
It's a gold annulet.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.430
What? What's wrong?

25:59.224 --> 26:05.438
I… I had a dream in the car, uh,
on the way here about an annulet.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.275
Did you? Well, then…

26:09.776 --> 26:11.278
May all our dreams come true.

26:14.364 --> 26:17.158
This is the best house-sitting gig
I've ever had.

26:21.788 --> 26:24.332
Rose certainly left you plenty to read.

26:26.501 --> 26:27.711
You a big reader?

26:29.838 --> 26:31.006
I prefer people.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.925
Hmm. That's good news for people.

26:41.558 --> 26:43.310
You, uh, never told me about the job.

26:45.562 --> 26:46.980
The one you found for Rose.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.064
Oh.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.234
I want Rose to come and work for me.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.654
See, I left my old job to be independent.

26:55.238 --> 26:58.450
I think, with Rose at my side,
I can put my boss out of business.

27:00.660 --> 27:04.039
Start something new that's… just ours.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.380
Something wrong?

27:13.089 --> 27:14.591
Yeah. I gotta get to work.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.718
More headhunting?

27:16.801 --> 27:18.219
Well, it looks like it.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.891
You sure you don't have time
for just one more round?

27:24.017 --> 27:26.645
Maybe this time without the dark glasses.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.535
Would you ask Rose to call me?

27:53.296 --> 27:57.300
There she is.
"Rose Walker. 21 years of age."

27:57.384 --> 27:59.886
"Mother, deceased. Father, deceased."

27:59.969 --> 28:01.262
Poor kid.

28:01.346 --> 28:05.058
There is a brother, Jed Walker.
And someone else.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.685
Is it true?

28:08.520 --> 28:12.148
Yes. The plans for the new celestarium
have been approved.

28:12.232 --> 28:16.569
I'm not here to talk construction.
I'm here to talk about the vortex.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.823
Lord Morpheus is already
monitoring her dreams.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.074
He better be.

28:21.157 --> 28:23.326
And sending Matthew
to watch her in the waking world.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.412
What? Who's Matthew?

28:25.495 --> 28:27.288
Merv. It's me.

28:27.997 --> 28:31.251
Stop. He's sending the new kid?

28:31.334 --> 28:32.168
Why not?

28:32.794 --> 28:36.965
You've been here for five minutes.
Do you even know what to watch for?

28:37.048 --> 28:38.925
No. Do you want to go?

28:39.008 --> 28:40.802
I do not.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.971
Then tell me what to watch for.

28:43.763 --> 28:44.597
Oh.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.059
Any unusual behavior.

28:48.143 --> 28:52.397
Said the pumpkin to the talking bird.
Can you be a little more specific?

28:53.565 --> 28:57.861
If the vortex manifests,
she would do so in her dreams,

28:57.944 --> 29:00.321
which of course reflect her waking life.

29:00.405 --> 29:03.742
So, look for any signs of shock or trauma.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.828
Anything that could
trigger her into killing us all.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.122
So, basically anything.

29:10.206 --> 29:12.751
-Basically, yes.
-Kid's a natural.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.253
Oh, and, birdie, you see anything,

29:15.336 --> 29:17.505
you tell Lucienne
before you tell the boss.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.257
-Mervyn.
-Stop.

29:19.340 --> 29:22.469
Everyone knows
you secretly run this place.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.971
-I got no problem with that.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.640
-Attabird.
-Thank you, Matthew.

29:29.476 --> 29:33.146
-Now, about the new celestarium--
-Later, Loosh.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.586
-Rose.
-Hal.

29:56.669 --> 29:57.921
Welcome home.

29:58.004 --> 29:59.297
-Thank you.
-Oh.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.257
How does it feel to be back?

30:02.175 --> 30:04.761
Cape Kennedy is exactly how I remember it.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.847
Yeah, change is not something
that happens in Florida.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.058
Oh, you must be Lyta. I'm Hal Carter.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.893
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.520
Hal owns the B and B.

30:13.603 --> 30:17.357
Yeah, it was my grandmother's house
once upon a time, but it's better now.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.067
-Oh, let me.
-Thank you.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.737
-Were you guys friends before?
-No.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.948
We met on the phone.
When I made the reservation.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.659
I may have told Rose my life story.

30:27.742 --> 30:29.160
I definitely told Hal mine.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.246
Hey! Are you Rose and Lyta?

30:31.329 --> 30:32.205
-Hi.
-Hi.

30:32.288 --> 30:33.706
-I'm Ken.
-I'm Barbie.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.544
-It's terrible.
-We know.

30:37.627 --> 30:40.213
-We're your downstairs neighbors.
-Well, not for much longer.

30:40.296 --> 30:43.925
We're off to look at some houses.
But we're all going out tonight, right?

30:44.551 --> 30:45.802
If you're not too jet-lagged.

30:45.885 --> 30:47.804
Uh, no. That sounds great.

30:47.887 --> 30:48.721
Great.

30:49.472 --> 30:51.599
And good luck today. With the foster lady?

30:51.683 --> 30:52.642
Thank you.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.353
I may have told them
your life story as well,

30:55.436 --> 30:58.314
but it's just to
spread the word about your brother.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.233
It's not because we were gossiping.

31:01.985 --> 31:04.237
We were sorry
to hear about your mother's death.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.866
-Her husband.
-Oh, and your husband's.

31:08.658 --> 31:11.369
Chantal and Zelda live upstairs
across the hall from you.

31:11.452 --> 31:14.330
We possess
the largest collection of stuffed spiders

31:14.414 --> 31:16.165
in private hands on the Eastern Seaboard.

31:16.791 --> 31:17.625
Oh.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.086
Would you like to see them?
Perhaps later this evening?

31:21.296 --> 31:23.172
-Oh.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.258
Zelda would like to know
if you've invited Gilbert.

31:25.341 --> 31:27.552
Yes, I slipped a note under his door.

31:27.635 --> 31:30.638
Oh. Until tonight, new housemates.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.559
They're really very sweet.

31:34.642 --> 31:35.852
Are they…

31:35.935 --> 31:37.979
Sisters? Mother? Daughter? Lovers?

31:38.062 --> 31:39.063
Nobody knows.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.691
But I feel
knowing would somehow ruin it.

31:41.774 --> 31:42.859
And who's Gilbert?

31:42.942 --> 31:44.819
Gilbert lives in the attic room.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.614
We don't see much of him.
He just sits up there and reads.

31:47.697 --> 31:48.740
So, is that it?

31:49.490 --> 31:51.826
Or is there anyone else
who knows everything about us?

31:51.910 --> 31:53.369
No secrets in this house.

31:53.453 --> 31:56.748
We're just one big, odd, happy family.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.166
Sorry.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.335
Don't be. Family's why we're here.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.047
I'm sorry, Miss Walker,

32:04.130 --> 32:07.467
but as I told your mother's attorney
on the phone and in my emails,

32:07.550 --> 32:10.219
I cannot, by law,
give out your brother's information.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.764
If you'd like to leave
your information for Jed's parents--

32:12.847 --> 32:16.434
-They're not his parents.
-They are while he is in their care.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.811
-But I'm his sister.
-I understand that.

32:18.895 --> 32:23.441
But you have to understand that,
as such, you have no legal claim to him.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.945
Could you just be
a fucking human being for a second?

32:27.028 --> 32:28.404
-Please?
-Rosie.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.573
No. We came all this way.

32:31.950 --> 32:36.204
My parents are dead, Miss Rubio.
Jed's the only family I have left.

32:36.829 --> 32:37.789
He's it.

32:38.581 --> 32:41.960
I just want to see him or talk to him.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.170
Just let him know I'm here.

32:47.882 --> 32:53.054
Rose, if I tell you
where your brother is, then what?

32:53.763 --> 32:54.764
I get in touch.

32:56.432 --> 32:58.309
I tell him about our mom.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.855
I ask him how he is. If he's okay.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.399
What do you do when he says,

33:04.482 --> 33:07.068
"I don't wanna live with these people.
I wanna live with you."

33:07.944 --> 33:09.195
Is that what you want?

33:09.821 --> 33:14.701
Are you prepared
to raise a 12-year-old boy by yourself?

33:14.784 --> 33:15.868
At your age?

33:16.911 --> 33:19.455
Do you have a job? Health care?

33:26.838 --> 33:29.716
Look. If it helps,

33:31.217 --> 33:33.803
Jed's fosters were friends of your dad's.

33:33.886 --> 33:34.929
They were?

33:36.764 --> 33:39.934
They took Jed in,
applied to be his fosters,

33:40.685 --> 33:44.897
and now they're getting 800 a month,
so Jed's doing just fine.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.449
Hey!

33:55.241 --> 33:57.076
-You've returned.
-How'd it go?

33:57.160 --> 34:00.204
Well, I didn't make any new friends
at the foster agency.

34:00.288 --> 34:03.583
You stood up for yourself.
I was very proud of her.

34:03.666 --> 34:06.044
Well, you can tell us all about it.

34:06.127 --> 34:08.171
-Over drinks.
-We're taking you out.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.131
-Right now?
-Absolutely.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.383
Well, you look so nice. Should we change?

34:12.467 --> 34:13.843
We always look this way.

34:13.926 --> 34:16.679
-They do. Even at breakfast.
-Right.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.432
Ooh.

34:19.515 --> 34:20.892
Shall we, ladies?

34:21.934 --> 34:24.270
-We'd love it.
-But shouldn't we wait for Hal?

34:25.646 --> 34:26.939
Hal's already there.

34:57.804 --> 34:58.638
Whoo.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.310
Hello? Unity?

36:28.519 --> 36:31.189
Hello? Hello? Are you there?

36:33.065 --> 36:34.525
Is your friend not there?

36:36.444 --> 36:37.528
I'll be your friend.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.490
And a girl like you
shouldn't be alone.

36:44.911 --> 36:48.372
I'm not alone. My friends are inside,
so I should probably--

36:48.456 --> 36:51.584
-Oh. We'll take your phone.
-And your wallet.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.252
That ring on your finger too.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.253
Gentlemen!

36:55.046 --> 36:58.841
Seems to me that this young lady's
desirous of retaining her jewelry

36:58.925 --> 37:02.511
and her honor.
Uh, you'll excuse me if I intrude.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.555
Thank you,
but that won't be necessary, sir.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.774
-Come on!

37:18.778 --> 37:19.904
You all right, miss?

37:21.405 --> 37:24.242
Sorry, that was…
really dumb of me.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.827
-Nonsense. It was--
-No, it was. It was.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.747
But thank you for your help.

37:29.830 --> 37:32.959
You didn't need my help.
You were doing quite well on your own.

37:34.001 --> 37:35.628
Shall we call the police?

37:35.711 --> 37:37.838
I think I just need to get home.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.257
Well, may I accompany you?

37:39.340 --> 37:41.968
And the name's Gilbert, by the way.

37:42.051 --> 37:44.470
Are you the Gilbert
who lives in Hal's attic?

37:44.553 --> 37:48.307
The very same. You aren't by any chance
the new downstairs front lodger?

37:48.391 --> 37:50.935
The very same. Rose Walker.

37:51.018 --> 37:55.314
Delighted. I was just on my way
to see our landlord's theatrical endeavor.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.983
You just missed it.

37:57.066 --> 37:59.860
I was reading, lost track of time.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.114
You are sure you're all right?

38:03.197 --> 38:04.699
I just need to get some sleep.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.867
Well, let's get you home then, shall we?

38:08.286 --> 38:10.037
So, what were you reading?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.205
Chesterton.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.082
Do you read him?

38:15.418 --> 38:17.962
I don't wanna be the bird who cried wolf.

38:18.045 --> 38:18.879
Oh, dear.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.300
But if Rose Walker's dreams tonight
are anything like her waking life…

38:22.383 --> 38:23.467
What happened?

38:23.551 --> 38:25.720
She was attacked outside a bar in Florida.

38:26.345 --> 38:27.930
She fought 'em off though.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.890
What is she doing in Florida?

38:29.974 --> 38:31.892
Looking for her missing brother.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.562
-Jed Walker is missing?
-Well, Rose can't find him.

38:39.442 --> 38:40.359
What?

38:42.570 --> 38:44.030
I can't find him either.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.948
Yeah, that's because he's missing.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.159
No, not just from the waking world.

38:48.909 --> 38:50.328
He's missing from the Dreaming.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.999
I figured if one copycat crime
doesn't get the Corinthian's attention,

38:55.666 --> 38:57.668
two will.

39:01.380 --> 39:02.381
Make that…

39:04.550 --> 39:05.593
three.

39:05.676 --> 39:08.054
Though I consider mine
to be more of an homage.

39:08.137 --> 39:10.514
You both said this was a terrible idea.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.976
-In the absence of a better one.
-We still need a guest of honor.

39:14.060 --> 39:18.314
And it was a fascinating exercise
getting inside the mind

39:18.397 --> 39:19.607
of a fellow collector.

39:19.690 --> 39:25.029
I mean, why the eyes,
or why only the eyes?

39:25.112 --> 39:27.281
They are the window to the soul.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.034
And they're really hard
to get out without popping them.

39:30.117 --> 39:32.745
The trick is to use your thumbs.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.748
-Oh, my!

39:36.332 --> 39:37.291
Yeah.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.379
I assume you were
trying to get my attention.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.091
Now that you've got it…

39:48.386 --> 39:50.346
tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

39:53.808 --> 39:57.853
We would, um… like you to be our guest.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.315
Our guest of honor.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.902
At our annual gathering of collectors.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.154
People who, uh, share our hobby.

40:07.988 --> 40:08.989
Hmm.

40:09.073 --> 40:13.577
We hoped that
since you are the current Corinthian,

40:14.245 --> 40:16.455
you might deliver the keynote speech.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.707
"The current Corinthian."

40:18.791 --> 40:22.128
Well, you don't look 130 years old to me.

40:22.795 --> 40:23.879
Thank you.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.382
Well, that's quite an honor.

40:26.465 --> 40:28.551
A gathering of like-minded souls.

40:28.634 --> 40:32.054
All, uh… sharing the same dream.

40:32.138 --> 40:35.182
A dream
that the Corinthian inspired.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.019
Oh. Well, in that case,
I wonder if I might bring a guest.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.563
A fellow collector?

40:41.063 --> 40:44.984
Oh, somebody who can take
our shared dreams to a whole new level.

40:46.318 --> 40:48.779
-Of course. Sure. Yeah.

40:49.363 --> 40:53.659
What is the name
of the guest or preferred sobriquet?

40:55.119 --> 40:59.665
Oh, yeah, well, where I come from,
they call her the vortex.

41:29.987 --> 41:33.908
Jed Walker is still in the realm
of the living, but I cannot find him.

41:33.991 --> 41:36.494
No. Nor I, my lord.

41:37.369 --> 41:40.247
All humans are connected to the Dreaming.

41:41.624 --> 41:43.792
They spend a third of their life here.

41:44.793 --> 41:47.588
Breaking that connection
would require knowledge.

41:48.797 --> 41:50.007
And power.

41:51.717 --> 41:53.594
Then it may interest you to know that

41:54.970 --> 41:59.642
the last nightmare Jed Walker had
before he disappeared was of Gault.

41:59.725 --> 42:02.269
You think she severed him
from the Dreaming?

42:02.937 --> 42:03.771
I do.

42:05.147 --> 42:05.981
Why?

42:06.649 --> 42:09.109
Because he's not just any child, is he?

42:09.777 --> 42:11.320
He's Rose Walker's brother.

42:11.987 --> 42:13.489
She is the vortex.

42:14.406 --> 42:15.574
Excuse me.

42:16.659 --> 42:18.202
I'm Rose Walker.

42:20.579 --> 42:22.623
What do you know about my brother Jed?

42:31.423 --> 42:33.050
Help me, please!

42:33.801 --> 42:35.052
Help!

42:39.598 --> 42:42.017
-Jed?
-Aunt Clarice?

42:44.812 --> 42:46.230
What are you doing here?

42:47.314 --> 42:48.315
I ran away.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.858
What? Why? What happened?

42:49.942 --> 42:52.319
Uncle Barnaby said
he's gonna lock me in the cellar.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.487
Why? What did you do?

42:53.571 --> 42:55.406
Nothing, I swear he hates me.

42:55.489 --> 42:56.532
That's not true.

42:57.116 --> 42:59.451
We have to get away from him.
Both of us, right now!

43:00.786 --> 43:02.162
Where would we go?

43:02.246 --> 43:06.917
We could go anywhere.
But we have to go now!

43:09.128 --> 43:10.087
Okay, okay.

43:25.394 --> 43:27.104
The hell is going on out here?

43:29.940 --> 43:33.027
Nothing, Barn. I just… I found Jed.

43:34.194 --> 43:36.322
-I was just gonna bring him home.

43:38.616 --> 43:39.742
No.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.287
Jed's coming home with me.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.373
Aren't you, Jed?

43:49.168 --> 43:50.127
Yes, sir.

43:59.428 --> 44:01.055
Oh, no, you don't get to ride up front.

44:01.764 --> 44:03.015
You're gonna ride in the back.

44:07.102 --> 44:08.437
Barnaby, no!

44:09.229 --> 44:10.856
You wanna get in there with him?

44:11.815 --> 44:13.525
Then don't tell me no.
