00:09.090 --> 00:12.389
So, Greek Orthodox, huh?

00:15.310 --> 00:18.188
I'm just curious.

00:18.230 --> 00:19.276
Yep.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.537
For how long?

00:20.580 --> 00:22.059
Long time.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.624
Your parents?

00:23.670 --> 00:26.104
Yeah, I have parents.

00:26.150 --> 00:27.879
Were your parents
Greek Orthodox?

00:27.940 --> 00:29.498
Yeah.

00:30.590 --> 00:33.195
So you believe in God?

00:33.250 --> 00:34.376
Yep.

00:34.420 --> 00:38.288
You believe
he's watching us now?

00:38.340 --> 00:41.332
Yeah.So you believe

00:41.380 --> 00:42.859
this is
fornication.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.775
First two were.

00:44.820 --> 00:47.607
The last one-- I don't know
what I would call that.

00:47.650 --> 00:50.608
[both chuckle]

00:50.650 --> 00:52.129
Does it bother you?

00:52.180 --> 00:53.829
A bit.

00:53.870 --> 00:55.303
Oh, no.

00:55.350 --> 00:57.136
This fallen woman
is dragging you down.

00:57.180 --> 01:00.263
You know
what's weird?

01:00.320 --> 01:03.096
I'm more judgmental
about my daughter's Christianity

01:03.150 --> 01:04.356
than yours. Why is that?

01:04.410 --> 01:06.401
I don't know.

01:06.450 --> 01:07.974
You're a bad person.

01:12.330 --> 01:14.719
I don't want you to feel
like you're doing wrong

01:14.770 --> 01:16.192
when you're with me.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.933
Yeah, you do.[chuckles]

01:17.990 --> 01:21.414
[chuckles]Yeah, I guess I do.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.783
It is ten after 9:00.

It's probably Diane.

Yep.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.133
Hey, Diane.

01:45.190 --> 01:47.146
Yes.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.408
Okay. I'll see you there.

01:49.450 --> 01:51.441

01:51.500 --> 01:54.719
Yeah. Another Dipple case.

Mm.Don't get up.

DIANE:
This is the footage

02:18.740 --> 02:20.696
taken from
Ms. Hamm's drone?

02:20.740 --> 02:23.698
Yes, that's
my understanding.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.308
And that, that is your house
right there, isn't it?

02:25.360 --> 02:28.397
Yes. 1547 Oakmont.

02:28.450 --> 02:30.839
Did you grant permission
for the drone to fly over it?

02:30.880 --> 02:33.144
No. Absolutely not.

02:33.190 --> 02:34.407
And how often
does it do that?

02:34.450 --> 02:36.975
Every day. Sometimes
several times a day,

02:37.020 --> 02:38.100
at unpredictable times.

02:38.150 --> 02:39.754
WOMAN: It has to be
unpredictable.

02:39.810 --> 02:41.710
That's the basic principle
of security sweeps.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.021
[bangs gavel]Ms. Hamm, please.

02:43.070 --> 02:44.378
Your lawyer will argue for you.

02:44.420 --> 02:46.502
And, uh, why is the drone such

02:46.550 --> 02:49.018
a problem for you?Well, it's
my business.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.945
I'm a therapist.
I practice out of my house.

02:50.990 --> 02:53.208
And do your patients complain?

02:53.260 --> 02:54.943
Yes. _
Some have even qUIt.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.127
They depend on me for
PriVaCY and they get this--

02:57.170 --> 02:59.126
surveillance.And that is
why you're sumg

02:59.170 --> 03:00.819
the owner of the drone?Yes.

03:00.870 --> 03:02.656
Her drone has led
to my busmess losses.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.179
DIANE: Thank you.
Nothing more.

03:04.220 --> 03:05.949
[quietly]:
Look at her.Do patients

03:06.010 --> 03:09.047
park in your garage,
Dr. Nachmann?My garage?

03:09.100 --> 03:11.352
No. I turned_that
Into my office.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.960
I see. Then do patients enter
your garage office

03:14.010 --> 03:14.965
through a covered walkway?

03:15.020 --> 03:16.226
No.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.145
So they park on the street,
then walk

03:18.190 --> 03:19.589
up to your house,
where anyone

03:19.630 --> 03:21.359
who happens to be around
could see them?

03:21.410 --> 03:22.934
Yes.How is that different

03:22.980 --> 03:25.232
from being observed
by a drone?

03:25.290 --> 03:29.192
Well, I guess you expect it
from someone on the street

03:29.250 --> 03:31.377
but not from the slq.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.240
And how much are you suing
my client for, sir?

03:33.300 --> 03:34.460
$300,000.

And yet you have

03:36.250 --> 03:37.160

Objection, Your Honor.

03:40.650 --> 03:42.254
Why don't we wait
till she gets to her question,

03:42.300 --> 03:43.380
then I'll sustain.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.214
I used to work for their firm,
Your Honor.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.262
And this case

03:47.310 --> 03:49.528
_ unless there was
an ulterIor motIve.ObjectIon, Your Honor.

03:49.570 --> 03:52.004
That has nothing to do
with this case.But it does, Your Honor.

03:52.050 --> 03:54.610
This case is a fiction.
It is a trial balloon sent up

03:54.660 --> 03:56.400
by Reese Dipple,
a reactionary billionaire

03:56.450 --> 03:58.145

we are out to takeYour Honor, she is trying

03:58.190 --> 03:59.964
their guns,
their Christmases,to play to your bias.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.716

04:02.760 --> 04:06.139
we have to deal with the case
in front of us.I agree.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.236
I just wish the plaintiffs
were more honest.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.156
Well, this is
a surprise.

And you're
good in court.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.219
How did you know it was Dipple?

04:26.260 --> 04:27.568
It was a guess.

04:27.610 --> 04:29.919
Two partners on this case,
it made no sense.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.473

So we can skip the part where
you pretend you want to date me.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.701
What can I help you with, sir?You can help me put
Peter Florrick in jail.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.490
How 'bout a Super-C
Quencher instead?

06:56.540 --> 06:58.929
Well, I can subpoena you to
testify against your father.

06:58.980 --> 07:01.938
Okay, here's the thing:
I am nobody.

07:01.980 --> 07:04.847
My last five jobs,
I needed to wear name tags.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.595
I live with three roommates,

from me, Ms. Gold.I don't know. Let me ask him.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.536
He can testify
against Peter Florrick,

07:33.580 --> 07:35.741
or I can use your testimony
to put him in jail

you bought the drone

PicketFenceWatch.com?

Yes. It's too big an area
for volunteers to secure,

08:47.040 --> 08:48.689
so the drone makes it
eaSIer to monitor.

08:48.740 --> 08:51.607
Have any of your other neighbors
complained about your drone?

08:51.660 --> 08:53.139

No. People love it.

your other neighbors' houses

09:17.900 --> 09:20.334
and leave Dr. Nachmann alone?Avoiding his house

09:20.380 --> 09:22.848
would mean not covering a lot
of other people who want it.

09:22.910 --> 09:26.425
But by "covering" this area,
you mean not just

09:26.470 --> 09:27.994
the public area,
like the street,

09:28.040 --> 09:30.565

No.Is that a person there,

09:37.010 --> 09:38.352

09:38.400 --> 09:40.527
Did that person
give you permission

Simply uses some discretion

10:03.600 --> 10:05.556

As much as I despair
and sympathize

10:20.090 --> 10:21.614
with our privacy

First Amendment rights.

10:27.140 --> 10:28.835
Dr. Nachmann, your petition

10:28.880 --> 10:30.666
for a declaratory
judgment is denied.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.837
The drone can fly.[bangs gavel]

10:35.720 --> 10:37.324

10:37.370 --> 10:39.804
Not you.
I'll call you back.

10:39.850 --> 10:41.329

10:41.370 --> 10:43.509
Exiled to the 27th floor.

10:43.550 --> 10:44.539
For doing what?

10:44.600 --> 10:47.637
Nothing.
Make room for Alicia.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.557
The next step in Diane's push

10:50.600 --> 10:52.386

10:52.430 --> 10:53.943
Diane pushed,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.685
but the Gerbil... stood by--
he never said a word.

10:56.740 --> 10:59.607
Cary's in on this?First she came
for the young guys,

10:59.650 --> 11:01.789
then the older guys.

11:01.830 --> 11:05.300
Pretty soon... there won't be
anybody left to speak for you.

Let us burn one

11:21.070 --> 11:23.231
From end to end

11:23.290 --> 11:24.769
And pass it over Are you all right?

11:24.810 --> 11:27.859
To me, my friend

11:27.900 --> 11:29.674
Burn it long You seem a little out of it.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.334
We'll burn it slow...

11:31.380 --> 11:32.984
Just tired.

Well, why don't you go home?

No.

What do you mean?

11:55.970 --> 11:57.790
All the changes.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.754
It was easier
when we started out.

12:01.800 --> 12:02.846
Well...

12:02.890 --> 12:04.061
yeah.

12:04.110 --> 12:05.452
Not necessarily better.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.062
Go home, Cary. Take a nap.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.076
An afternoon off
isn't gonna change anything.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.281
And if you're
causing no harm

12:15.340 --> 12:17.422
Then you're all right
with me

13:36.290 --> 13:38.064
[starts engine]

14:01.490 --> 14:03.310
I'm just saying,
he knew details.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.533
What kind of details?He had a transcript

14:05.580 --> 14:07.616
of an entire phone conversation
you and I had.

14:07.670 --> 14:09.752
About?Judge Schakowslq.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.142
He... What?

14:11.190 --> 14:12.839
How you tipped that judge off
about the FBI sting.

14:14.410 --> 14:16.196
The only way he could know that

14:16.240 --> 14:18.891
is if he had a wiretap
in the governor's office.

14:18.940 --> 14:19.895
Is he insane?

14:19.940 --> 14:21.453
He's like an evil Boy Scout.

14:21.510 --> 14:23.808
He said he wants you to testify
against Peter

14:23.860 --> 14:24.815
at the trial.Wait...

14:24.860 --> 14:27.420
did he say "trial"
or "grand jury"?

14:28.950 --> 14:30.599
"Trial," I think.
Is that important?

14:30.650 --> 14:32.208
If he said "trial,"
that means he knows

14:32.260 --> 14:33.773
he's gonna get an indictment.

14:36.740 --> 14:37.695
He definitely said "trial."

Damn it!

[taps button]CAITLIN: That's you shooting
the drone down, isn't it?

14:44.140 --> 14:46.870
Yes. That is me.Your Honor, we request
an immediate judgment

14:46.920 --> 14:49.002
as a matter of law--
Dr. Nachmann just admitted

14:49.060 --> 14:50.664
to violating
your ruling.

14:50.710 --> 14:52.666
Your Honor, you said
the drone could fly.

14:52.710 --> 14:54.849
You didn't say Mr. Nachmann
couldn't protect his property.

14:54.890 --> 14:56.664
Oh, come on.Is that an objection?

14:56.720 --> 14:58.017
No, it's an expression
of amazement.

14:58.070 --> 14:59.139
Show me in the
order where...

14:59.200 --> 15:00.542
No one needs
to spell it out.

15:00.590 --> 15:02.455
No one did spell it out.
And by analogy

15:02.510 --> 15:03.841

are we going next,

15:03.900 --> 15:05.413

15:05.460 --> 15:06.984
now that you mention it...Your Honor, please,

15:07.030 --> 15:08.110
isn't it implicit in your order

15:08.160 --> 15:09.639
not _to shoot at
my client's drone?

15:09.690 --> 15:10.850
Why?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.207
It's illegal
to discharge a firearm

15:12.250 --> 15:13.774
in Chicago but not in Oak Park.

15:13.820 --> 15:15.811
It's not the weapon
we're objecting to.

15:15.870 --> 15:17.383
It's the target.

15:17.430 --> 15:19.990
We ask for compensatory damages
in the amount

15:20.040 --> 15:23.123
of $80,000, and $10,000
in punitives,

15:23.180 --> 15:25.956
along with a clear instruction
from the court

15:26.010 --> 15:27.910
that the defendant
may not shoot drones

15:27.970 --> 15:30.438
out of the slq.Actually, Your Honor,
I would like an opportunity

15:30.490 --> 15:32.833
to examine him first.He's already admitted

15:32.880 --> 15:35.440
to shooting it down.But he didn't admit
to doing anything wrong.

15:35.490 --> 15:37.492
May I?By all means.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.622
Dr. Nachmann, did you feel
threatened by the drone

15:39.670 --> 15:41.399
flying over your house
yesterday?

15:43.020 --> 15:45.329
Seriously?Did you believe
it was making

15:45.370 --> 15:47.065
a violent, riotous,
or tumultuous assault?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.929
Yeah, with all the noise
and the hovering, absolutely.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.673
Oh, this is ridiculous.Did you believe

15:50.730 --> 15:53.290
what you did was necessary
to repel the drone?

15:53.340 --> 15:55.900
Very much so.720 ILCS

15:55.950 --> 15:59.329

15:59.390 --> 16:01.551
Castle doctrine? _
You're applying Castle doctrine?

16:01.610 --> 16:04.431
Your Honor, this is
still about Mr. Dipple's

16:04.480 --> 16:08.007
libertarian fantasies...Again, the plaintiff
is attempting to provoke bias.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.746
Castle doctrine allows
the use of force

16:10.790 --> 16:13.964
to the extent necessary
to terminate or prevent

16:14.010 --> 16:15.966
unlawful entry.Are you saying
Dr. Nachmann

16:16.010 --> 16:18.661
thought the drone was going
to enter his home?

16:18.710 --> 16:21.053
Drones are capable of doing more
than record video, Your Honor.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.101
They can steal,
interfere with,

16:23.150 --> 16:24.936
and destroy things
inside the house

16:24.980 --> 16:27.289
without ever entering.

16:27.330 --> 16:29.503
The drone overflight was
a de facto intrusion,

16:29.550 --> 16:31.154
which means _
Castle doctrine applies.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.930
Honestly...
is that a reasonable fear?

16:33.990 --> 16:34.945
No!Yes!

16:34.990 --> 16:36.116
Then prove it.[bangs gavel]

You just sat there
and let Diane

16:40.340 --> 16:42.729

16:42.780 --> 16:45.999
Do you realize that the camel's
nose is already in our tent...

16:46.040 --> 16:48.088
That was the lesser
of two evils.

16:48.130 --> 16:50.121
What's the other evil?

16:50.180 --> 16:52.648
Having a pantless octogenarian
scaring away clients.

We're name partners,
David.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.089
Nobody can move us out.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.914
Together we have more equity

16:57.970 --> 16:59.744
in this place than
Diane does. And...

16:59.800 --> 17:02.098
if we have to play
that trump card...

17:02.150 --> 17:05.233
so be it.I don't know

17:05.280 --> 17:06.884
if you're confident or covering,

17:06.930 --> 17:09.979
but I do know this:
this is war.

17:10.020 --> 17:11.976
And before the women
make their next move,

17:12.030 --> 17:15.022
we need to fire a shot
across their bow.

17:15.070 --> 17:16.799
[automatic gunfire]

17:21.730 --> 17:24.255
Mr. Pert, what are
we seeing there?

17:24.300 --> 17:26.120
An unmanned
aircraft system--

17:26.170 --> 17:28.638
drone, in common parlance--
modified to carry

17:28.690 --> 17:31.693
AR-15 machine gun.With all due respect,
Dr. Nachmann would have known

17:31.740 --> 17:34.174
if Ms. _Hamm's dr_one
was carrying a machine gun.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.041
Thank you,
Your Honor.But drones can carry more

17:37.090 --> 17:39.046
than just machine guns,
can't they?Absolutely.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.264
[gunshot]ALICIA: Did that drone

17:41.320 --> 17:43.709
have a handgun
attached to it?

A Beretta Pico.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.703
Only about five inches long.
Drones can be fitted

17:47.760 --> 17:49.182
to carry virtually any weapon.Okay,

17:49.240 --> 17:51.196
uh, this is, uh, entertaining,

17:51.240 --> 17:53.322
but I'm not sure
why it's relevant.

17:53.370 --> 17:55.099
It's not.DIANE: The havoc
that drones

17:55.160 --> 17:58.675
can wreak isn't limited
to weapons, is it, Doctor?No.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.768
It's almost impossible to tell
unless you take it apart,

18:00.810 --> 18:03.461
but this drone has a camera
that does thermal imaging.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.428
Now, this drone looks like
a basic hobbyist's toy,

18:07.470 --> 18:09.938
when, in fact,
it's equipped with a...

18:10.000 --> 18:12.389
_Wi-Fi router that
tricks your computer
into connecting with it.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.432

your personal

been established that

18:18.830 --> 18:21.003
my client's drone has none
of these modifications.

18:21.050 --> 18:23.006
Yes, but our client
had no way of knowing.

18:23.050 --> 18:25.189
Isn't that right, Doctor?Drones can
absolutely intrude

18:25.230 --> 18:27.619
on a person's home
without entering it.

18:27.670 --> 18:31.663
If that's what Dr. Nachmann said
he was afraid of, he's smart.

18:31.710 --> 18:34.019
CAITLIN: You study and
develop drone technology

18:34.060 --> 18:36.233
at Chicago Polytech,
is that right?

18:36.280 --> 18:37.417
Yes.Would that include
the study

18:37.460 --> 18:39.360
of flight paths
and trajectories?

18:39.420 --> 18:42.799
Yes, of course.Now, if you could tell me,
before my client's drone

18:42.860 --> 18:44.930
is shot out of the sky,
is it hovering

18:44.990 --> 18:46.241
in a stationary position,

18:46.290 --> 18:48.201
or moving toward
Dr. Nachmann's home?

18:48.250 --> 18:50.241
Well, that drone actually looks
like it's flying

18:50.300 --> 18:53.258
away from the house.So even if Ms. Hamm's
drone hadattempted

18:53.300 --> 18:56.428
a violent or illegal intrusion,
it was in fact retreating.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.914
And under Illinois law,
including the Castle doctrine,

18:58.960 --> 19:01.428
it is illegal to shoot
an intruder in the back

19:01.480 --> 19:03.698
if he, or in this case it,
is retreating.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.354
[whispers]:
Damn.

19:07.010 --> 19:08.398

Yep.

19:08.450 --> 19:10.224
She's right on the law.

19:10.270 --> 19:13.353
Damages in the amount of $10,000
are awarded to Ms. Hamm.

19:13.410 --> 19:16.629
Dr. Nachmann... don't
shoot at drones.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.412
Nice office.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.848
It's very comfortable.

Thank you.Terrific.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.769
Because I think you're gonna
be in here for a while.

19:26.810 --> 19:29.415
I need examples
where a pre-nup

19:29.470 --> 19:33.292
was deemed invalid due to...
unconSCIonable terms.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.422
Okay. Illinois, right?

19:35.470 --> 19:37.643
Illinois, but I want to be
belt-and-suspenders on this.

19:37.690 --> 19:40.215
Let's make it a
50-state survey.

19:40.260 --> 19:42.603
Great.
Uh, but Alicia has asked me

19:42.650 --> 19:45.130
_ to finish this
busmess development plan.

19:45.180 --> 19:47.353
Let me give you three reasons
why I don't care.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.220
Number one:
I outrank Alicia.

19:49.270 --> 19:50.521
Numbers two
and three:

19:50.580 --> 19:51.911
they don't matter,

19:51.970 --> 19:54.928
because I outrank Alicia.

19:54.970 --> 19:57.700
Your intimidation tactics
may have worked on my daughter,

19:57.760 --> 19:59.318
but they will
not work on me!

19:59.370 --> 20:00.974
Hello, Eli.
Would you like

20:01.020 --> 20:03.193
to sit down?You do not want the
Inspector General,

20:03.240 --> 20:05.754
let alone The New York Times,
to learn that you put

20:05.810 --> 20:08.540
a wiretap in the ofﬁce
of a sitting governor!

20:08.590 --> 20:10.546
Will you please
give us a second?

20:10.600 --> 20:11.931
[clears throat]

20:13.690 --> 20:15.555
I didn't tap his office, Eli.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.556
I tapped your daughter's phone.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.775
You wh...Yep. Awful, huh?

20:20.820 --> 20:23.163
The lengths an AUSA will go
to arrest someone

20:23.220 --> 20:25.780
who simply does something...
criminal.

20:25.830 --> 20:26.785
[chuckles]

20:26.830 --> 20:28.172
She worked for

20:28.220 --> 20:29.915
Lloyd Garber,
who I was investigating,

20:29.960 --> 20:32.520
so I had probable cause.My daughter knows

20:32.570 --> 20:33.969
nothingabout
anything illegal

20:34.010 --> 20:36.183
Lloyd Garber or
Peter Florrick did...

20:36.230 --> 20:37.481
may have done.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.440
Agreed. But she
does have knowledge

20:39.490 --> 20:41.572
of something illegal youdid.

20:43.020 --> 20:45.932
You're squeezing my
daughter to get to me.

20:45.980 --> 20:48.141
I'm not a big fan
of the word "squeezing," but...

20:48.200 --> 20:50.156
yes.I know nothing

20:50.200 --> 20:51.508
about the Locke mistrial.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.768
Good. Then you have
nothing to worry about.

20:53.810 --> 20:55.949
[sighs]:
Look”.

20:55.990 --> 20:59.244
you have a choice,
a simple choice.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.291
Help me take down
Peter Florrick,

21:01.340 --> 21:04.559
or your daughter
helps me take you down.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.703
Hey.

21:20.750 --> 21:22.308
All right, then,

21:22.360 --> 21:23.531
I will see you tomorrow.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.184
No, just a few questions.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.753
Thank you.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.324
Hey.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.588
What are you doing
working up here?

21:30.630 --> 21:33.360
I don't know.
It's quieter.

21:35.590 --> 21:37.319
I missed you last night.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.200
Just... work.

21:42.770 --> 21:45.421
Well, what are you
doing tonight?

21:48.780 --> 21:52.341
Look, Alicia...

21:52.390 --> 21:54.824
I like you.
I like you a lot.

21:54.870 --> 21:56.394
Seriously?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.782
What do you want me to say?

21:57.830 --> 21:59.559
I don't want you
to say anything. I want you

21:59.620 --> 22:01.656
to do what you did
the other day.

22:01.710 --> 22:03.393
I want you...[talking, laughter nearby]

22:03.450 --> 22:06.055
MAN [laughing]:
She was...Can you give us a minute?

22:06.100 --> 22:07.749
Please?

22:07.800 --> 22:09.051
MAN:
Just to make sure we get...

22:09.110 --> 22:10.714
We'll move it out
in the hallway here.

22:10.760 --> 22:14.366
I want to use you
and I want you to use me.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.934
This is purely sexual.

22:16.980 --> 22:18.891
I like it, too.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.465
Is this about your religion?

22:23.510 --> 22:24.681
No.

22:24.730 --> 22:26.857
Because I do_n_'t
want your spirit.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.775
I want your body.

22:28.820 --> 22:30.606
It's not about that.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.345
Then what?

22:34.130 --> 22:36.690
Your husband came home
yesterday morning.

22:36.740 --> 22:38.867
Oh, God.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.740
What?

22:40.790 --> 22:42.178
Look, whatever he said,

22:44.620 --> 22:46.269
I just don't like
coming in the middle

22:46.320 --> 22:48.356
of something.We'll meet
at your place tonight.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.833
No. It's not really...Well, then we'll
go to a hotel.

22:50.890 --> 22:53.973
Side of the road.
Backseat of my car.

22:54.020 --> 22:55.840
[door opens]

22:59.900 --> 23:02.846
I'm seeing you tonight.
At my apartment.

23:02.900 --> 23:06.119
After that, you can
do whatever you want.

23:14.910 --> 23:16.775
CAITLIN:
Alicia, how are you?

23:16.830 --> 23:17.819
Peachy.

23:17.870 --> 23:20.122
Your client shot down
another drone.

23:20.180 --> 23:22.785
[elevator bell dings]This time, not with a gun,

23:22.830 --> 23:25.173
but with an electronic device
called a Drone Dropper.

23:25.220 --> 23:27.097
Alicia, you need
to talk to your client.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.131
I don't need to do anything.

23:45.980 --> 23:46.890
PETER:
Uh...

23:46.940 --> 23:48.373
Alicia, I'm a little
busy here.

23:49.990 --> 23:52.072
Give me a second.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.556
What's going on?

24:02.130 --> 24:03.643
Alicia?

24:08.140 --> 24:09.960
I want a divorce.

24:16.890 --> 24:19.097
I want a divorce.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.108
What's wrong?

24:29.160 --> 24:31.287
Nothing's wrong.

24:31.330 --> 24:32.854
I want a divorce.

24:32.900 --> 24:36.336
Yeah, well, I'm in
the middle of something.

24:36.380 --> 24:38.109
Okay, you take
care of that.

24:38.170 --> 24:39.683
I'll have my lavwer call you.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.476
This is about your
investigator, isn't it?

24:45.520 --> 24:46.737
My investigator?
Mm-hmm

24:46.780 --> 24:49.522
Yes.

24:49.570 --> 24:51.265
I would never think
of divorcing you

24:51.310 --> 24:53.699
unless I had some
other man to call my own.

24:53.750 --> 24:54.785
Come here.
I'm not getting...

24:58.320 --> 24:59.878
[door slams]

25:01.760 --> 25:03.796
I saw him yesterday,

25:03.850 --> 25:05.750
walking around
in his boxer shorts,

25:05.800 --> 25:07.802
acting like he
owned the place.

25:07.850 --> 25:09.932
Yes, because I own the place,

25:09.980 --> 25:11.368
and I told him
he was welcome

25:11.420 --> 25:13.285
to walk around naked
if he wants.

25:13.330 --> 25:15.639
And Grace? Oh, you don't give
a damn about your daughter.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.851
[laughs]

25:16.900 --> 25:19.027
Yes. I'm an unfit mother.
In the divorce,

25:19.080 --> 25:21.514
you can get full custody
for the three weeks

25:21.560 --> 25:22.857
before she goes
to college.

25:22.910 --> 25:24.901
Well, this must be true love.

25:24.950 --> 25:27.293
Again.

25:27.350 --> 25:29.693
Is that what
would upset you most?

25:29.740 --> 25:31.605
IfI was in love?

25:31.660 --> 25:33.264
No, what upsets me
the most

25:33.310 --> 25:35.437
is that you're shoving it
in my face.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.094
I'm not shoving anything.

25:37.140 --> 25:39.483
This is me not caring.

25:39.530 --> 25:41.441
Not caring what people think.

25:41.490 --> 25:42.832
What Eli thinks.
You think.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.098
Or what the FBI thinks.

25:45.150 --> 25:47.448
You know I'm about to be
indicted, don't you?

25:47.500 --> 25:49.274
Peter, you're always
being indicted.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.673
If it weren't today,
it would be tomorrow.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.678
I'll have my lavwer call.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.369
Thanks.

26:12.830 --> 26:14.695
DIANE:
You told Dr. Nachmann
not to shoot a drone,

26:14.740 --> 26:17.436
so he brought it down
safely and he returned it.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.436
JUDGE DUNAWAY:
Well, was the drone returned
to Ms. Hamm in one piece?

26:19.490 --> 26:20.969
CAITLIN:
It was, but...

26:21.010 --> 26:22.614
JUDGE DUNAWAY: Why are you
bothering me with this?

26:22.660 --> 26:24.093
He gave the drone back,
it wasn't damaged.

26:24.140 --> 26:25.789
CAITLIN:
Because it's against the law.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.319
FAA rules prohibit
interfering

26:27.360 --> 26:29.271
with the operation of
an aircraft midflight,

26:29.320 --> 26:31.015
including by disabling it.Your Honor...

26:31.060 --> 26:34.678
18 U.S.C. 32 applies to
airplanes and helicopters.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.017
Not unmanned drones.

26:36.070 --> 26:38.026
Actually, the law applies
to any aircraft in the

26:38.070 --> 26:39.628
special aircraft jurisdiction
of the United States.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.193
JUDGE DUNAWAY:
And are drones

26:41.250 --> 26:42.854
in the special aircraft division
of the United States?

26:42.900 --> 26:44.117
BOTH:
No!
Yes.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.411
CAITLIN:
Drones must be registered

26:45.470 --> 26:46.550
with the FAA.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.942
DIANE:
But whether that puts them

26:47.990 --> 26:50.686
within FAA jurisdiction
would depend on

26:50.730 --> 26:53.472
the height at which
the drone was flying.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.693
And the FAA's draft
regulation on drones

26:55.740 --> 26:57.469
is unclear
on this issue.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.738
Oh, well, then perhaps we should
talk to someone from the FAA.

26:59.790 --> 27:01.394
[sighs]

27:01.440 --> 27:02.429
[elevator bell dings]

27:06.010 --> 27:08.058
If Peter sent you...

27:08.100 --> 27:08.998
He didn't.

27:09.060 --> 27:11.051
Well, what do you need?

27:11.100 --> 27:12.658
Can I talk to you?

27:12.710 --> 27:14.496
Privately?

27:14.540 --> 27:16.019
DIANE:
Uh, certainly.

27:19.810 --> 27:21.368
ELI:
I need a lawyer.

27:21.420 --> 27:23.763
You do? Or Peter does?

27:23.810 --> 27:25.061
Peter has
Mike Tascioni.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.759
And this may be
an instance where...

27:27.820 --> 27:31.904
my interests and the
governor's... diverge.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.110
Understood.

27:33.170 --> 27:34.865
So everything I'm about to say

27:34.910 --> 27:36.161
will be covered _under
attorney-client prIVIlege?

27:36.210 --> 27:39.122
[indistinct conversation
nearby]

27:40.740 --> 27:42.867
And you can't share
this with Alicia.

27:44.310 --> 27:45.698
I understand.

27:45.750 --> 27:48.173
The Federal prosecutor,
Connor Fox,

27:48.230 --> 27:50.653
is trying to force me to testify
against Peter at trial.

27:50.710 --> 27:54.578
Okay, well, if or when
you're subpoenaed,

27:54.620 --> 27:56.497
you can obviously
take the Fifth.

27:56.540 --> 27:57.757
I'm not worried about
incriminating myself,

27:57.800 --> 27:59.017
I don't know anything.

27:59.060 --> 28:00.709
But the AUSA
doesn't believe that.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.068
No.

28:02.110 --> 28:04.362
Well, if you
truly don't know anything,

28:04.420 --> 28:06.411
why don't you just
get up there and say that?

28:06.460 --> 28:09.065
Here's the problem.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.987
I... told my daughter

28:12.030 --> 28:14.032
something that I did

28:14.080 --> 28:16.469
that may have...

28:16.520 --> 28:18.249
obstructed justice.

28:18.300 --> 28:21.690
And he's going to force Marissa
to testify against you

28:21.740 --> 28:24.300
if you don't help him
take down Peter.

28:24.350 --> 28:26.306
So what do I do?

28:28.350 --> 28:29.396

Hey.

What's up?

28:32.710 --> 28:34.098
I'm hiding.

28:34.140 --> 28:35.744
From who?
David Lee.

He dumped a 50-state
survey on me.

28:38.710 --> 28:39.665

Oh, yeah.

28:39.710 --> 28:41.712
He likes to haze
newcomers.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.934
Mm, it felt like
more than that.

28:46.940 --> 28:48.237
He's probably
feeling threatened.

28:48.290 --> 28:51.248
Diane's...

28:52.900 --> 28:54.891
[indistinct chatter
continuing]

28:58.820 --> 29:02.779
Diane's been aggressive about
this female-led firm idea.

29:02.820 --> 29:05.607
Are we taking over?

29:05.650 --> 29:07.470
I don't know. I don't know
if I have the stomach

29:07.520 --> 29:08.828
for a gender war right now.

29:08.870 --> 29:10.690
Would we make more money?

Probably.

Funny thing.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.402
I need yours.
You start.

29:24.450 --> 29:26.668
David Lee is hazing Lucca.
He's got her doing

29:26.720 --> 29:29.496
a pointless 50-state survey
to complete overnight.

29:29.550 --> 29:31.279
Yeah, he did that to me
when I started.

29:31.330 --> 29:32.581
You, too.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.279
Yes, but Lucca was my partner.

29:35.330 --> 29:38.413
And when you convinced me
to come back,

29:38.470 --> 29:39.858
I convinced her.

29:39.900 --> 29:43.028
Okay. Now I have
a favor to ask you....

29:43.080 --> 29:45.036
Sure.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.513
Don't side with Diane.

29:46.560 --> 29:47.993
With what?

29:49.300 --> 29:51.086
You know with what.

29:52.350 --> 29:54.170
Cary...

29:54.220 --> 29:55.744
I'm not a name partner.

But you're a name.

This is none of my business.

29:59.140 --> 30:01.267
It's between
you and Diane.

And you can't take sides?

30:06.540 --> 30:08.576
Okay.

Good to know.

30:13.550 --> 30:15.768

You work for

30:38.400 --> 30:40.527
I do-- the Enforcement
and Compliance Division.

30:40.570 --> 30:42.265
So you're familiar
with the FAA's

30:42.310 --> 30:44.005

airspace is?

30:50.970 --> 30:52.847
It's the band that
the FAA doesn't control.

30:52.890 --> 30:54.972
It's between zero and 500 feet,

30:55.020 --> 30:56.840
not including approaches
to airports.

30:56.890 --> 30:59.450
And above 500 feet,
it would be illegal

30:59.500 --> 31:01.582
to disable a drone aircraft,

31:01.640 --> 31:04.894
for example, by using a device
such as the Drone Dropper?

31:04.950 --> 31:05.814
That is correct.

31:05.860 --> 31:07.418
But below 500 feet,

31:07.470 --> 31:09.119
that is not
the FAA's jurisdiction?

Your Honor, pomt

31:11.390 --> 31:12.516
JUDGE DUNAWAY:
Regarding?

31:12.560 --> 31:13.606
United States v. Causby.

31:15.430 --> 31:17.125
That's C-A-U-S-B-Y,

31:17.170 --> 31:19.912
not...
the other way.
Thank you.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.393
Uh, that case established

31:21.440 --> 31:22.919
that an individual's
property rights include

31:22.960 --> 31:25.224
_at least as much of the
airspace above the ground

31:25.270 --> 31:29.354
as one could occupy or use
in connection with the land.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.140
Do we have a number?
83 feet.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.146
Exactly 83 feet?

31:33.190 --> 31:35.533
That was the height below which
the Court found

31:35.580 --> 31:37.582
an airplane flying over
Mr. Causby's land

31:37.630 --> 31:38.585
would frighten his chickens.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.018
Of course.

31:40.070 --> 31:41.753
My client's drone was

31:41.810 --> 31:44.768
at 200 feet and therefore not
on Dr. Nachmann's property.

31:44.810 --> 31:46.243
Your Honor,
this is preposterous.

31:46.290 --> 31:47.678
That's a 70-year-old case.

31:47.730 --> 31:48.890
But still good law.But it's

31:48.950 --> 31:50.429
hardly applicable to what

31:50.470 --> 31:51.903
_ we've seen is
cutting-edge technology.

31:51.950 --> 31:54.555
CAITLIN:
The law's the law.

31:56.430 --> 31:59.388
Well, as far as the FAA
is concerned,

31:59.430 --> 32:02.388
if a drone is flying
at 83 feet or below,

32:02.440 --> 32:04.954
Dr. Nachmann would be within
his rights to take it down.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.875
And above 500 feet,
it would be illegal.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.524
And at 200 feet?

32:08.570 --> 32:12.574
Well, it's not clearly
his property at that point,

32:12.620 --> 32:16.317
but it's not clearly... not.

32:18.760 --> 32:22.753
As a representative
of the FAA's legal department,

32:22.810 --> 32:24.971
would you like to clear that up?

32:25.030 --> 32:26.759
No.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.550
Well, we're waiting
to hear from the public

32:31.600 --> 32:33.204
and private sectors before

32:33.250 --> 32:35.115
we regulate
Class G airspace.

32:35.170 --> 32:37.115
So for the time being...

32:37.170 --> 32:41.732
Between 83 and 500 feet,
it's the Wild, Wild West.

32:41.780 --> 32:44.214

A good one.

32:44.260 --> 32:47.991

ones, but what's the plan?

32:48.050 --> 32:50.006
Developing.

32:50.050 --> 32:52.041

you're putting me off.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.705
Don't worry about me.I'm worried
about me, too.

32:54.750 --> 32:56.661

and it would be a lot of guilt

32:56.710 --> 32:57.870

putting you away.

the same long-term goals.

about Howard,

You can proceed
with the divorce.

41:46.240 --> 41:49.710
Just get everything ready.
I won't contest it.

41:50.760 --> 41:54.457
But...

41:54.510 --> 41:56.546
don't make it public
until afterwards.

41:56.600 --> 41:59.819
I can't have it look like you're
leaving me because I'm guilty.

41:59.860 --> 42:02.943
After that, we'll go
our separate ways.

42:02.990 --> 42:05.686
Live our lives.

42:05.740 --> 42:09.346
See each other
when the kids graduate.

42:10.700 --> 42:14.522
But I need to ask you
this one last favor.
