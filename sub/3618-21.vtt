WEBVTT

00:03.160 --> 00:06.755
You know, your time-travel section
is due for a serious overhaul.

00:07.079 --> 00:10.674
I mean, I can find
more information Googling.

00:10.997 --> 00:13.591
- Googling?
- Never mind.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.813
Any luck with that spell yet?

00:18.084 --> 00:19.995
You mean since the last
two minutes you asked me?

00:20.252 --> 00:21.765
I'm just getting a little nervous here.

00:22.003 --> 00:23.152
My birthday, it's in two days.

00:23.377 --> 00:25.174
And if I'm not out of here
before I'm born...

00:25.420 --> 00:27.615
Something bad that you don't
know about could happen?

00:27.880 --> 00:29.472
I just don't wanna take any chances.

00:29.715 --> 00:33.424
Besides, I came here and did what I
had to do, and that was to save Wyatt.

00:33.759 --> 00:35.033
Now it's time for me to go home.

00:38.801 --> 00:40.632
- Sooner than you might think.
- Oh, no.

00:40.886 --> 00:43.195
- No, no, no. Not yet. You're early.
- Oh, relax.

00:43.470 --> 00:46.109
I'm just getting a jump on things.
I'm not in labour.

00:46.389 --> 00:48.505
I'm sending some stuff
back to the house.

00:48.765 --> 00:50.835
Just don't scare me, okay?

00:51.099 --> 00:52.691
What's the matter?
Isn't the spell ready?

00:52.934 --> 00:55.323
I think it's ready.
This should work.

00:55.602 --> 00:57.479
Should work? What do you mean?

00:57.728 --> 00:59.480
There are no guarantees
with time travel, Leo.

00:59.730 --> 01:01.721
You should know that
better than anyone.

01:04.105 --> 01:07.257
Sorry. There's always a chance
that something might go wrong.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.637
All right, we're not taking
any chances.

01:09.899 --> 01:11.537
We might have to.
I'm running out of time.

01:11.775 --> 01:13.731
No, I'm not sending you
through a one-way portal

01:13.985 --> 01:15.418
unless I know
where you're gonna land.

01:15.652 --> 01:16.846
Well, you can never be certain.

01:17.319 --> 01:19.958
Unless, of course, you went too.
And even then...

01:21.489 --> 01:24.765
All right, let's just forget the spell
and start to work on that potion again.

01:25.074 --> 01:27.986
But the spell has a better chance
of working. It's the power of three.

01:28.408 --> 01:29.807
Yes, but if something goes wrong,

01:30.034 --> 01:31.865
he'll have extra potion
and he can come back.

01:32.119 --> 01:33.837
I agree, it sounds safer.

01:34.078 --> 01:35.830
So why don't you guys
get to work on that.

01:36.079 --> 01:37.353
Paige, can you orb these home?

01:37.580 --> 01:39.332
Just squeeze them
in the nursery or something.

01:39.581 --> 01:40.900
Nursery.

01:41.121 --> 01:43.954
- You did clean out the nursery, right?
- Yeah.

01:44.248 --> 01:46.682
No. I was working on the spell,
I'm sorry.

01:46.958 --> 01:50.871
Well, you better hurry, or else baby
Chris will be sleeping in your room.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.281
Yeah, don't worry. I'm all over it.

01:54.587 --> 01:58.739
- Okay.
- Don't forget diapers. Lots of diapers.

01:59.297 --> 02:00.810
Okay, gotta get out of here.

02:11.678 --> 02:14.272
They prepare to send the boy home.

02:19.225 --> 02:21.295
It's time.

02:21.559 --> 02:25.108
For our plan to work,
we have to get the sisters...

02:25.436 --> 02:27.825
And Leo and Chris out of the way.

02:29.605 --> 02:31.675
Don't worry, we will.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.031
Okay.

04:20.281 --> 04:23.353
Hello, Phoebe. Excuse me, Phoebe.

04:23.742 --> 04:25.733
Hello.

04:25.993 --> 04:27.711
Hey, Mrs. Noble, what's up?

04:27.951 --> 04:30.988
What's up is you've parked
in my driveway again.

04:31.287 --> 04:33.881
Yeah, unfortunately there's
nowhere else to park.

04:34.162 --> 04:35.436
So I should suffer?

04:35.663 --> 04:37.494
Piper's bringing home
the baby in a couple days,

04:37.748 --> 04:38.863
and I did a little shopping.

04:39.082 --> 04:41.755
This is getting to be a real problem.

04:42.041 --> 04:43.520
You know what?
Just do me a favour.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.548
Let me run inside
and put these bags down,

04:45.793 --> 04:47.306
then I'll come outside
and move the car.

04:52.964 --> 04:54.113
You called the patrol guy?

04:54.338 --> 04:56.454
This is the third time
this week you blocked me.

04:56.715 --> 04:59.434
Yeah, well, if your dumpster
didn't take up half the block,

04:59.716 --> 05:01.911
then I wouldn't have to park
in your driveway.

05:02.175 --> 05:04.325
This is against
neighbourhood-association rules.

05:04.803 --> 05:05.792
Excuse me.

05:06.012 --> 05:10.290
Can you write her a citation for that
ugly eyesore dumpster over there?

05:10.639 --> 05:12.630
Homeowner's got a permit.

05:13.224 --> 05:14.577
I don't have time for this.

05:21.769 --> 05:23.999
Oh, look at how cute.

05:24.271 --> 05:27.263
I remember when baby Wyatt
used to fit in here.

05:27.562 --> 05:30.759
This is not cute.
This is the bassinet from hell.

05:31.065 --> 05:35.536
- You know how to put this together?
- No, that would be a Leo thing.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.414
I still can't believe
we're bringing home a baby.

05:38.693 --> 05:40.923
Yeah, well, this baby's
not gonna have anywhere to sleep.

05:41.195 --> 05:43.584
I know. What made us wait so long
to do this baby room?

05:44.030 --> 05:46.590
We were busy trying to keep Wyatt
from turning evil.

05:47.072 --> 05:50.303
Here, let me help you.

05:50.616 --> 05:51.810
You know, which I'm glad we did.

05:52.032 --> 05:54.387
But it just means that
he's gonna need a bedroom.

05:54.659 --> 05:57.332
Yeah, well, even if he was evil,
we'd need another bedroom.

05:57.619 --> 06:01.009
Yeah, but now with everybody coming
home, plus one, we're a room short.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.522
I guess I can sleep
on the couch.

06:02.745 --> 06:05.498
I just really think we need to focus
on the baby right now.

06:05.789 --> 06:07.268
Well, and on getting Chris home.

06:07.915 --> 06:08.950
Oh, remember him?

06:09.166 --> 06:11.680
You know, the nephew?
The one you've been avoiding?

06:12.083 --> 06:13.072
I am not.

06:13.876 --> 06:16.390
Okay, so why weren't you helping
Gideon and I with the spell?

06:16.669 --> 06:19.103
Because I was helping Leo
trying to find the burdock root.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.608
It was very hard to find.
It's back-ordered everywhere.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.589
You're right. You know what, we're just
gonna get Chris a new bassinet.

06:26.590 --> 06:27.943
I'm gonna miss him too, you know.

06:30.468 --> 06:31.457
It sucks.

06:32.052 --> 06:36.443
I mean, I know he's going back
to a better future and all, it's just...

06:36.804 --> 06:39.113
We're just getting to know him,
you know?

06:39.389 --> 06:40.663
I know.

06:44.183 --> 06:45.536
I forgot to move my car.

06:49.019 --> 06:52.978
- Sheila.
- It's getting to be a habit, isn't it?

06:53.312 --> 06:54.904
Me showing up a wreck.

06:58.565 --> 07:01.955
I mean, we never fight,
that's the thing.

07:02.733 --> 07:05.167
At least, we never used to.

07:05.443 --> 07:10.597
But lately Darryl's just been
so on edge, you know?

07:10.986 --> 07:12.260
Any idea why?

07:12.487 --> 07:14.557
Actually, I was hoping
you might know.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.315
Me?

07:16.530 --> 07:20.079
I went to his work the other day,
just to say hi,

07:20.408 --> 07:24.083
and I saw an arrest warrant
on his desk for Chris.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.004
- Chris? Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

07:27.287 --> 07:29.437
I even asked about it,
if he was gonna make it go away.

07:29.704 --> 07:30.898
That's when he just lost it.

07:31.413 --> 07:32.812
He told me to stay out of it,

07:33.039 --> 07:35.189
and stay away from you girls
from now on.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.947
Did something happen
that I don't know about?

07:39.708 --> 07:42.427
A couple of weeks ago,

07:43.126 --> 07:46.277
Darryl got really scared
when he was trying to cover up for us.

07:46.586 --> 07:50.420
And we felt horrible, you know,
but obviously it really affected him.

07:50.755 --> 07:52.586
Enough not to cover for Chris?

07:53.715 --> 07:55.194
He got really scared.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.848
Maybe you just need
to give him some time.

07:59.094 --> 08:02.211
Yeah, but that doesn't help you
right now, and it doesn't help Chris.

08:04.513 --> 08:08.142
Look, I love Darryl,
and I know this is eating him up inside,

08:08.471 --> 08:10.541
but you girls are like family to us.

08:12.307 --> 08:14.582
You don't turn your back on family.

08:20.352 --> 08:22.946
I wonder how different
the future's gonna be.

08:23.229 --> 08:26.062
How much different
my life is gonna be.

08:27.105 --> 08:29.573
I just want you to get home safely.

08:30.482 --> 08:32.631
Now, remember,
if anything seems different,

08:33.607 --> 08:36.725
you have another vial of this
to get back right away.

08:39.153 --> 08:41.587
You worry too much, you know that?

08:41.863 --> 08:43.376
I'll be fine.

08:43.614 --> 08:45.252
I'm your father.

08:45.490 --> 08:46.843
It's my job to worry.

08:47.949 --> 08:50.383
Listen, when you get back there,
take it easy on Wyatt, okay?

08:50.659 --> 08:51.728
You can't hold a grudge.

08:51.952 --> 08:54.864
Hey, as long as he's
not ruler of all evil, I'm cool.

08:55.161 --> 08:56.674
I'm serious.

08:56.912 --> 08:59.062
He's gonna be different. Good.

08:59.329 --> 09:01.365
He's not gonna remember he wasn't.

09:01.622 --> 09:04.090
If you really wanna change the future,
start with a clean slate.

09:04.374 --> 09:06.888
Okay, okay. I get it.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.680
How about you?

09:08.918 --> 09:10.476
You starting with a clean slate?

09:10.711 --> 09:12.622
- How do you mean?
- Like you and Mom.

09:13.836 --> 09:17.590
I'd like to know where you two are
headed before I go back. That's all.

09:18.254 --> 09:20.973
It's complicated. I'm an Elder.
I made a commitment.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.406
So? It's not like you haven't
broken the rules before.

09:23.675 --> 09:24.949
I'm living proof of that.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.125
We'll see.

09:32.638 --> 09:33.912
We have enough of this stuff,

09:34.139 --> 09:36.289
if you wanna try a dry run
before everybody gets here.

09:36.557 --> 09:37.706
What do you think?

09:39.307 --> 09:42.105
Yeah. Let's do it.

09:53.521 --> 09:54.510
That should have worked.

09:57.065 --> 09:59.818
I'll get you home, buddy. I promise.

10:05.444 --> 10:07.480
We're gonna figure this out.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.932
You gotta keep your head up.

10:21.326 --> 10:24.363
That potion almost certainly
would have worked.

10:24.869 --> 10:26.985
We stopped them just in time.

10:27.246 --> 10:30.477
Though it wasn't supposed to hurt.

10:35.457 --> 10:37.368
Shall we?

10:46.129 --> 10:48.120
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:49.799 --> 10:51.710
At least now they'll be forced
to use our spell.

10:51.967 --> 10:52.956
The sooner, the better.

10:53.176 --> 10:56.646
Wyatt's magic grows stronger
by the day.

10:56.969 --> 11:01.724
- That much power in one being...
- Is bound to turn him...

11:02.096 --> 11:03.893
- Evil.
- Good.

11:06.015 --> 11:08.688
We have to get those that protect him
out of the way.

11:08.974 --> 11:10.851
Starting with Leo and Chris.

11:14.144 --> 11:15.862
Gideon?

11:17.521 --> 11:20.319
Hey, it looks like we're gonna need
that spell after all.

11:21.438 --> 11:24.236
- Is there an echo in here?
- It's poor acoustics.

11:24.523 --> 11:27.162
Have Piper gather her sisters
and I'll get the spell.

11:27.441 --> 11:29.352
Okay. You know, I don't
understand what happened.

11:29.609 --> 11:32.999
- That potion should've worked.
- Like I said, time travel is tricky.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.115
You will still be escorting your son?

11:35.361 --> 11:37.556
Well, I think so.
I think it's safest, don't you?

11:37.821 --> 11:39.095
Absolutely.

11:39.322 --> 11:41.358
Gather everyone together.
I'll be right along.

11:49.243 --> 11:50.915
Here they come.

11:53.244 --> 11:56.680
- Darryl. Hey, Darryl.
- Darryl, stop.

11:56.996 --> 11:59.715
- We just need to talk to you.
- We have nothing to talk about.

11:59.997 --> 12:03.546
Look, Chris is going home today,
to his future home.

12:03.874 --> 12:05.148
Yeah, and we were hoping,

12:05.375 --> 12:07.809
you know, that you could find it
in the goodness of your heart,

12:08.085 --> 12:10.519
even though we know
that you're mad at us,

12:10.795 --> 12:13.389
to, you know, just throw away
his file.

12:13.671 --> 12:16.026
The one with the little
arrest warrant in it?

12:17.424 --> 12:20.143
Apparently I haven't
made myself clear.

12:20.425 --> 12:24.816
I am done covering for you. Done.
Now, excuse me.

12:25.176 --> 12:26.291
Darryl, think about it, okay?

12:26.510 --> 12:28.978
The cops are gonna come for Chris,
and what are they gonna find?

12:29.261 --> 12:30.660
A little itsy-bitsy baby.

12:30.887 --> 12:34.163
And then they're gonna find us,
which risks exposure.

12:34.890 --> 12:38.963
Well, you should have thought of that
before you broke Chris out of jail.

12:39.975 --> 12:43.729
Inspector Sheridan thinks that Chris'
breakout was an inside job.

12:44.061 --> 12:46.859
Which, if I'm not careful,
could point back to me.

12:47.145 --> 12:50.057
I've got a family to think
about too, you know. Great.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.870
- Inspector Sheridan.
- Have you seen Chris lately?

12:56.650 --> 12:57.639
Chris who?

12:58.943 --> 12:59.932
When you have a minute.

13:05.863 --> 13:08.855
At least Chris isn't gonna
have to deal with her in the future.

13:11.198 --> 13:14.076
- Where are Phoebe and Paige?
- I'm sure they'll be here soon.

13:14.367 --> 13:16.323
Soon? Soon is when
Dad and I have to go.

13:16.575 --> 13:17.849
Dad? What do you mean...?

13:18.076 --> 13:19.475
Wait, you're gonna go too?

13:19.702 --> 13:22.296
Just long enough to make sure
he gets where he needs to be.

13:22.579 --> 13:25.013
And when exactly were you
gonna tell me about this?

13:25.289 --> 13:26.927
I told him he didn't have to come.

13:27.165 --> 13:28.917
- I don't need him.
- No, it's too dangerous.

13:29.166 --> 13:32.078
Last time you went through a portal,
you were almost dinosaur kibble.

13:32.374 --> 13:34.842
- I have to go.
- You're right, it is dangerous.

13:35.126 --> 13:38.562
But not as dangerous as leaving
Wyatt alone while I'm in labour.

13:38.877 --> 13:41.345
I'll be back. I promise.

13:44.422 --> 13:47.858
Sorry, I just wanted to go over
the spell one more time.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.405
- Make a few tweaks.
- Tweaks? Let me see that.

13:54.553 --> 13:56.032
Finally. Where have you two been?

13:56.262 --> 13:58.218
Sorry, we were a little held up.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.587
But we're here now,
so let's get this show on the road.

14:00.848 --> 14:03.408
You know, the clock's a-ticking.
Ticktock, ticktock.

14:03.681 --> 14:05.592
Since when are you in such a hurry
to say goodbye?

14:06.099 --> 14:09.330
Well, since something happened with
the thing and the thing with the thing.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.351
There's a warrant out
for Chris' arrest.

14:17.897 --> 14:19.808
- What?
- Yeah, tried to get Darryl to bury it,

14:20.065 --> 14:22.181
but he's not really
on our side anymore.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.273
This is bad. If I leave and they
can't find me, they'll come after you.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.532
That's okay. We've been through
worse, we'll get through this.

14:28.818 --> 14:30.649
We'll figure it out.

14:31.403 --> 14:34.600
And if you get back to the future and
we're in jail, you just bust us out.

14:39.572 --> 14:43.645
You just go back to that beautiful,
peaceful world that you helped create.

14:47.701 --> 14:50.738
- I'm really gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.

14:53.204 --> 14:54.523
Here comes the hugging part.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.501
Thank you for coming here.

15:10.422 --> 15:12.492
I love you.

15:12.756 --> 15:14.508
I love you so much, Mom.

15:16.467 --> 15:19.618
Now, go on. Hurry. And be safe.

15:21.510 --> 15:24.786
- Thanks for all your help.
- You did a noble thing in coming here.

15:27.888 --> 15:29.037
Be good.

15:31.724 --> 15:33.954
<i>In this place and in this hour</i>

15:34.225 --> 15:36.819
<i>We call upon the ancient power</i>

15:37.102 --> 15:39.377
<i>Open the door
Through time and space</i>

15:39.643 --> 15:42.282
<i>Create a path to another place</i>

16:06.239 --> 16:07.513
Where are we?

16:15.368 --> 16:16.562
I have no idea.

16:25.748 --> 16:27.818
Something's gone wrong.
Don't let them leave.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.941
Are you out of your mind?

16:37.171 --> 16:39.162
Follow me.

16:39.964 --> 16:43.161
- What the hell was that all about?
- I'm not sure.

16:43.464 --> 16:46.854
You're not sure? Chris just tried
to kill me and you're not sure?

16:47.175 --> 16:48.813
We were supposed
to send him to the future,

16:49.051 --> 16:50.325
not turn him into a darklighter.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.349
Excuse me, people,
those were black orbs.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.233
Where did they get black orbs from?

16:54.471 --> 16:57.781
Okay, breathe. Breathe, Piper.
You don't wanna go into labour yet.

16:58.097 --> 16:59.086
Well?

16:59.306 --> 17:01.900
Well, perhaps the spell
wasn't specific enough.

17:02.182 --> 17:03.410
Meaning what?

17:04.558 --> 17:08.186
Meaning it worked, obviously,
it opened up a portal,

17:08.519 --> 17:12.955
not to another time,
but to another world.

17:13.311 --> 17:14.631
A parallel world.

17:14.855 --> 17:19.246
And not just any parallel world,
one that's the exact reverse of ours.

17:19.608 --> 17:23.442
- Reverse like what, reverse like evil?
- Precisely.

17:24.984 --> 17:26.862
You see, it's all part
of a grand design.

17:27.111 --> 17:30.421
A universe destined
to maintain balance.

17:30.946 --> 17:35.303
Light and dark, yin and yang,
good and evil.

17:35.906 --> 17:37.578
For good to prevail in this world,

17:37.824 --> 17:41.021
then an equally evil world
must also exist.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.999
- That's quite a faulty design, isn't it?
- No, it's not, Paige.

17:44.286 --> 17:45.560
Balance is everything.

17:45.787 --> 17:48.096
Without it, the cosmos doesn't spin.

17:48.370 --> 17:52.249
Are you telling me that when our
Leo and Chris stepped in there,

17:52.581 --> 17:54.856
their evil selves stepped out?

17:55.123 --> 17:56.636
Yes, it's a mirror world.

17:56.874 --> 17:58.705
Whatever happens there,
happens here.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.190
So our Leo and Chris
are in their evil world.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.928
- Well, we gotta go get them.
- You can't go get them.

18:04.212 --> 18:05.247
You're not going anywhere.

18:05.463 --> 18:08.455
Besides, what about those evil fellows
that just came through here?

18:08.756 --> 18:09.871
We'll go get them later.

18:10.090 --> 18:13.287
Actually, I think you should
go after them now.

18:13.591 --> 18:14.660
Why?

18:15.843 --> 18:18.198
Because for every second
that they're in our world,

18:18.469 --> 18:21.745
they risk throwing off the balance
by doing something evil.

18:29.806 --> 18:32.479
You ever see anything so good?

18:32.767 --> 18:34.086
It's disgusting.

18:34.309 --> 18:36.903
Can you believe the liquor stores
are closed in the mornings here?

18:37.186 --> 18:38.221
What's up with that?

18:38.437 --> 18:41.474
Didn't stop you from
kicking down the door to get in.

18:41.771 --> 18:43.409
Why didn't you orb in?

18:43.647 --> 18:45.638
What's the fun in that?

18:48.649 --> 18:53.404
Strange. Everything seems the same
but kind of different, you know?

18:53.775 --> 18:57.404
It's cleaner, it's happier,
it's more civilized.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.011
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

19:00.904 --> 19:03.099
This place makes me sick.

19:03.865 --> 19:04.934
I gotta get out of here.

19:05.156 --> 19:08.865
Gives you an idea of what kind of
awful saccharine future I came from.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.156
Why I had to come back
and change it so bad.

19:11.409 --> 19:13.969
And I'll always be
proud of you for that.

19:14.869 --> 19:17.906
You saved Wyatt from turning good.

19:18.203 --> 19:20.239
You gave us a second chance.

19:20.497 --> 19:24.126
The least I could do is get you back
to your future, back to evil.

19:24.458 --> 19:25.937
Thanks, Dad.

19:26.168 --> 19:28.477
First we gotta get back
to our world, though.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.185
We're gonna need
the power of three.

19:30.420 --> 19:34.174
Well, we can't trust those
Pollyanna witches, they're too good.

19:35.339 --> 19:39.332
God, who do I have to kill
so we can get out of here?

19:40.466 --> 19:42.661
I think I might know somebody.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.509
Somebody we can use
to force the sisters to help us.

19:52.847 --> 19:55.680
I don't understand. If they're
just like our Leo and our Chris,

19:55.974 --> 19:58.408
then why do we need
a crystal cage to trap them?

19:58.682 --> 20:00.673
So they don't try to kill us again,
for one thing.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.764
Yeah, I don't think they
were trying to kill us.

20:03.017 --> 20:05.372
I think that they were
just surprised, like we were.

20:05.644 --> 20:08.363
Yeah, well, I am not taking
any chances.

20:08.645 --> 20:10.795
- Hey, did you get any hits yet?
- No, nothing.

20:11.063 --> 20:13.054
They must not be
doing anything evil.

20:13.314 --> 20:17.592
Yeah, well, if Gideon's right,
it's just a matter of time.

20:17.942 --> 20:21.571
Besides, we wouldn't want the cosmos
to stop spinning, would we?

20:21.902 --> 20:24.462
It's so weird to think that there
are evil twins of us out there

20:24.736 --> 20:26.772
doing the exact same thing
as we are right now.

20:27.571 --> 20:29.766
I can't think about that.
It hurts my brain.

20:30.946 --> 20:32.504
I got them.

20:37.950 --> 20:40.100
What the hell's wrong with you?
I'm a cop.

20:40.368 --> 20:42.836
- Pretty wimpy-Iooking one, too.
- Nothing like our Darryl.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.759
I think that's the cheapest suit
I've ever seen.

20:47.038 --> 20:49.393
What's the matter, huh?
Girls not paying you enough?

20:49.664 --> 20:51.700
Paying me?
What has gotten into you?

20:51.958 --> 20:54.916
Let's just say I don't like you
coming at me in either world.

20:59.211 --> 21:00.929
This almost isn't any fun.

21:04.171 --> 21:06.082
I don't care if you are under
some kind of spell.

21:06.339 --> 21:07.852
Come any closer, I'll shoot, I swear.

21:08.632 --> 21:10.429
Gun.

21:14.384 --> 21:16.534
- Now, this is fun.
- Not yet.

21:16.802 --> 21:18.520
We still need him for leverage.

21:18.762 --> 21:20.514
He's no good to us dead.
Not yet, anyway.

21:28.516 --> 21:30.472
See, this is
the crazy-ass kind of stuff

21:30.725 --> 21:33.364
that makes me not wanna have
anything to do with you people.

21:33.644 --> 21:35.362
- Who are you talking to?
- Us.

21:38.688 --> 21:39.916
That's not gonna stop us.

21:40.147 --> 21:42.502
No, but this will.

21:45.441 --> 21:46.840
- Son of a bitch.
- No.

21:48.651 --> 21:51.040
Nice firepower, Leo.
I didn't know you had it in you.

21:51.736 --> 21:53.533
Don't go anywhere.

21:55.737 --> 21:57.648
- Stay away from me.
- Let us take you to Gideon.

21:57.905 --> 21:59.941
- He can heal you.
- No. Stay away.

22:00.198 --> 22:02.712
- Darryl, please.
- I said, no, damn it. Leave me alone.

22:02.992 --> 22:05.790
I don't wanna have anything to do
with you anymore, do you understand?

22:08.159 --> 22:10.753
Well, I don't think
that helped our cause any.

22:14.871 --> 22:16.862
My Charmed Ones
will be joining you soon.

22:17.123 --> 22:19.876
- Are you certain you can keep...
- Mine away?

22:20.166 --> 22:21.918
Absolutely.

22:22.167 --> 22:23.600
I told them to wait at the manor

22:23.834 --> 22:27.065
for the good Leo and Chris
to come to them.

22:28.462 --> 22:29.577
I'm taking your knight.

22:34.298 --> 22:35.777
I knew you'd do that.

22:38.549 --> 22:41.746
- So the next move, of course, is...
- Piper.

22:42.426 --> 22:45.259
Once she's in labour,
we'll have a clear shot at the boy.

22:45.552 --> 22:48.862
If we impress upon her the extent
of the danger her sisters are in...

22:49.179 --> 22:52.296
- It will expedite matters.
- But everything has to happen quickly.

22:52.598 --> 22:56.352
We're tinkering here with the grand
design, risking its tenuous stability.

22:56.683 --> 23:00.596
By creating an imbalance of power
on one side, I know.

23:00.935 --> 23:04.371
But it's a far greater risk
to allow Wyatt to grow up...

23:04.686 --> 23:07.723
To threaten both worlds. I agree.

23:16.858 --> 23:18.257
I like the way you think.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.203
Gideon?

23:22.861 --> 23:24.897
- No echo.
- A good sign.

23:28.114 --> 23:29.832
They can never know
we were behind this.

23:30.072 --> 23:32.267
They won't.

23:38.785 --> 23:39.774
Did you catch them?

23:39.994 --> 23:41.586
Yeah, stuck them in a classroom.

23:41.829 --> 23:43.467
And, you know, they can't
orb out of there.

23:43.706 --> 23:45.776
They're a little feistier
than the real Chris and Leo.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.076
I don't know how we're
gonna get them to cooperate.

23:48.333 --> 23:50.324
Yeah. Well, I'm sure
your evil counterparts

23:50.584 --> 23:52.620
are anticipating exactly
the same problem,

23:52.877 --> 23:55.311
since, other than morality,
you're one and the same.

23:55.586 --> 23:58.100
How does that help us figure out
what we're supposed to do?

24:00.297 --> 24:02.049
Perhaps you should
trade yourselves.

24:02.714 --> 24:04.591
You go into their world,
they'll come into ours.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.274
You can each retrieve
your respective Leo and Chris.

24:08.634 --> 24:10.067
Kind of makes sense.

24:10.719 --> 24:12.789
And what about
your evil counterpart?

24:13.054 --> 24:14.567
Will he be hip to this plan?

24:15.261 --> 24:19.334
I have every confidence that he will
be waiting there exactly as I am here.

24:19.681 --> 24:24.232
But remember, good or evil,
we're all after the same thing:

24:24.599 --> 24:28.831
Leo and Chris returned
and the cosmic balance restored.

24:29.851 --> 24:31.079
Get Piper.

24:32.561 --> 24:34.313
We're gonna need
the power of three.

24:51.653 --> 24:53.769
Okay, where is everybody?

24:54.028 --> 24:56.747
Isn't Piper supposed to be here?

24:57.030 --> 24:58.019
This is weird.

24:58.239 --> 24:59.831
I don't think we should be here.

25:00.074 --> 25:01.826
We should get out of here.

25:06.869 --> 25:08.222
What are you doing?

25:08.454 --> 25:11.332
You're not supposed to be here.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.194
Why didn't they come through?

25:18.417 --> 25:20.453
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

25:23.501 --> 25:27.289
Easy. Piper, try to relax.

25:27.629 --> 25:31.542
We wouldn't want you to go into
premature labour, now, would we?

25:42.052 --> 25:44.441
You have no idea what you've done.

25:44.720 --> 25:50.078
By coming here, you may have thrown
both worlds irreversibly out of balance.

25:50.473 --> 25:53.192
Okay, well, doesn't killing us
sort of do that too?

25:53.475 --> 25:56.865
Don't be ridiculous.
If I'd wanted to kill you, I would have.

25:57.185 --> 26:00.495
I was just caught off-guard.

26:00.812 --> 26:03.406
Well, you need to relax there, tiger.

26:03.688 --> 26:07.317
It's a different world here, Pheebs.

26:07.940 --> 26:10.215
One filled with distrust.

26:10.482 --> 26:13.076
Even amongst allies.

26:13.734 --> 26:16.089
I don't understand.
Where are your Paige and Phoebe?

26:16.361 --> 26:19.159
Out looking for your Leo and Chris.

26:19.446 --> 26:20.879
They were supposed
to bring them here.

26:21.113 --> 26:25.072
Well, your Leo and Chris are at our
magic school waiting to be rescued.

26:26.615 --> 26:27.889
Yes.

26:28.407 --> 26:30.159
Okay, this is just one big mess.

26:30.408 --> 26:33.445
What happened to the whole
yin-yang business?

26:33.743 --> 26:35.017
It's been thrown off.

26:35.245 --> 26:38.874
Possibly as a result of
the exchange of Leo and Chris.

26:39.496 --> 26:44.206
Two worlds that mirror each other
when they're in balance.

26:45.292 --> 26:46.884
And they no longer are.

26:47.126 --> 26:50.914
Okay, if it's already bad, what's
gonna happen now that we're here?

26:51.252 --> 26:53.004
With both sets of sisters
on the same side,

26:53.254 --> 26:54.972
the balance is dangerously at risk.

26:55.213 --> 26:57.966
We have to work quickly to correct it.

26:59.422 --> 27:02.061
If you are suggesting a plan, don't.

27:02.339 --> 27:04.136
We've got it covered.
You don't worry about it.

27:04.382 --> 27:05.576
We need to find his Piper.

27:05.800 --> 27:08.758
If you do, she'll probably kill you.
She's evil, remember?

27:09.052 --> 27:11.964
And she's got a terrible temper,
worse when she's pregnant.

27:13.388 --> 27:15.458
Yeah, that's not much
different in our world.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.712
- Trust us, we can handle it.
- Yeah.

27:17.973 --> 27:20.965
Your instincts are right
to distrust me.

27:21.266 --> 27:23.860
I am evil, after all.

27:25.476 --> 27:27.194
But we both want the same thing.

27:28.309 --> 27:29.662
There's a little problem with that,

27:29.894 --> 27:32.169
because your girls didn't uphold
their end of the bargain.

27:32.437 --> 27:36.066
- They did not find our guys.
- But you will.

27:36.397 --> 27:38.353
You know them.

27:39.399 --> 27:40.878
Know how they think.

27:41.483 --> 27:45.920
Okay, so we're gonna bring you
your Chris and Leo, and then what?

27:46.277 --> 27:48.472
You'll have our Piper
for a power of three spell.

27:49.695 --> 27:51.606
She'll know it's the only way
to get her men back.

27:51.863 --> 27:55.094
And if you encounter
your counterparts, be careful.

27:55.573 --> 27:57.006
They will kill you.

28:07.747 --> 28:12.298
- Give it up, lady.
- Hey, my purse. Come on.

28:20.377 --> 28:24.086
Okay, this place isn't just evil,
it's ugly.

28:24.421 --> 28:26.013
Oh, I don't think they're home.

28:26.256 --> 28:28.531
And I don't wanna go in there
to find out.

28:28.799 --> 28:31.233
The Charmed Ones working for evil.
Who would have thunk it?

28:31.509 --> 28:34.501
Well, I'm with you,
especially after Gideon's little warning.

28:36.093 --> 28:37.082
Hey!

28:38.885 --> 28:42.321
I don't think Chris and Leo would
have gone into that house either.

28:42.638 --> 28:45.311
Maybe they went to see Darryl,
like their counterparts did.

28:45.597 --> 28:47.076
I think we should talk to Darryl.

28:47.306 --> 28:49.695
I don't think if Darryl wants to talk
to us in the good world,

28:49.974 --> 28:51.692
he's not gonna talk
to us in the evil world.

28:51.934 --> 28:54.607
That's it. Come on, come on.
That's it. Hey.

29:01.647 --> 29:05.606
Hey, maybe he will
if he thinks we're them.

29:05.939 --> 29:07.770
Okay, I really think we need
to get out of here.

29:08.024 --> 29:09.173
What are you doing?

29:09.400 --> 29:11.630
Let's see if this works
in the parallel world.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.697
It does.

29:14.402 --> 29:16.962
Hi, can I have Lieutenant Morris,
please?

29:17.237 --> 29:18.226
Hey.

29:19.071 --> 29:21.665
Lady, you want me to give her a
second citation, it's gonna cost you.

29:22.323 --> 29:24.279
Why, you greedy son of a...

29:24.532 --> 29:27.410
- Haven't I given you enough already?
- Hey, don't give me that.

29:27.701 --> 29:29.054
Hey, leave her alone.

29:31.828 --> 29:35.218
I wasn't really gonna
give you that citation.

29:43.374 --> 29:45.934
We must be some badass
witches in this world.

29:46.209 --> 29:50.725
Yeah, remember that for when
we meet up with badass Darryl.

30:19.475 --> 30:21.466
Well, looks like everybody's
enjoying themselves.

30:21.727 --> 30:23.285
Including Darryl.

30:27.479 --> 30:29.947
Okay, just remember,
we're used to this.

30:30.230 --> 30:34.508
Right. Think mean, think nasty.

30:39.110 --> 30:40.304
Hey.

30:43.027 --> 30:44.426
It's all right, let them through.

30:46.404 --> 30:48.122
I knew you'd show up
sooner or later.

30:48.363 --> 30:49.682
How's Sheila?

30:54.241 --> 30:55.993
It's all right, honey.
I'll be here all night.

30:57.952 --> 30:59.908
Sheila who?

31:07.540 --> 31:09.019
Leo and Chris, where are they?

31:10.291 --> 31:11.883
Where are they?

31:12.876 --> 31:15.310
Last time I saw them,
they were at the police station.

31:15.584 --> 31:18.337
Me and my boys were trying
to give Chris what he deserved.

31:18.628 --> 31:20.698
But Leo orbed him away.

31:20.961 --> 31:22.713
Never seen them run
from a fight before.

31:22.963 --> 31:24.601
- Where'd they go?
- If I knew,

31:24.839 --> 31:26.318
you think I'd be here waiting for you?

31:27.757 --> 31:29.907
Where you been, anyway?
Undercover in the underworld?

31:30.634 --> 31:32.829
- Why?
- Bright, happy colours?

31:33.093 --> 31:34.811
Not exactly your style.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.983
Get away from me. I don't want
Sheridan to see me with you.

31:38.263 --> 31:39.457
She's been all over my ass.

31:51.434 --> 31:52.423
Don't get up.

31:54.728 --> 31:55.797
Now what?

31:56.020 --> 31:58.090
I think maybe we're looking
at this all wrong.

31:58.355 --> 31:59.993
Maybe we all are.

32:00.230 --> 32:01.299
Come again?

32:01.522 --> 32:05.959
Well, listen, if Darryl won't help
Leo and Chris because he's evil,

32:06.316 --> 32:09.035
then they'd have to go to someone
who's good, right, to help them?

32:09.318 --> 32:12.310
Okay, yeah. But who's not evil here?
Where are the good guys, they hiding?

32:12.610 --> 32:14.726
Yeah, in the underworld.

32:14.987 --> 32:18.582
Think about it.
Reverse it, who's good here?

32:18.907 --> 32:20.101
Demons.

32:20.324 --> 32:22.280
Right. And if I know Leo,

32:22.534 --> 32:27.244
he would have gone after the
most powerful good demon there is.

32:28.787 --> 32:30.505
You're right.

32:32.371 --> 32:35.443
I know the truth of all your hopes

32:35.748 --> 32:40.105
because I can feel your
greatest hope inside here:

32:40.458 --> 32:43.291
The hope to one day return home.

32:44.377 --> 32:48.256
Oh, and of course your presence
here gives me great hope.

32:48.588 --> 32:53.457
The hope that someplace there
really is a different kind of world.

32:53.839 --> 32:56.876
A world where the greater good,

32:57.174 --> 33:02.453
the goodness of the heart, prevails.

33:05.761 --> 33:08.321
- Is he for real?
- He must be.

33:08.596 --> 33:12.350
Demon of fear in our world
must be the demon of hope here.

33:12.682 --> 33:14.877
Question is, do you have
enough power to send us back?

33:15.142 --> 33:17.781
Oh, alas, no, I do not.

33:18.059 --> 33:20.778
Not if you were brought here
by the power of three.

33:22.270 --> 33:25.740
But, however, hope springs eternal.

33:26.062 --> 33:30.453
So I may be able to persuade
the sisters of my world to help us.

33:30.814 --> 33:34.124
All simply by relying...

33:34.441 --> 33:37.717
...on their greatest hope:

33:38.027 --> 33:41.019
The hope to reunite
with your counterparts.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.776
And then...

33:46.573 --> 33:51.010
...maybe you will be able to return

33:51.367 --> 33:53.835
to your time before it's too late,
as you hope.

33:54.619 --> 33:55.813
Don't touch me.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.718
Oh, thank God.

33:58.953 --> 34:00.944
Quickly, orb away.

34:01.204 --> 34:03.354
I will deal with them.
I've done it before.

34:03.622 --> 34:05.658
No, that's okay.
They're the good ones.

34:06.416 --> 34:08.213
Trust us, they're not evil.

34:08.458 --> 34:10.494
No, but we are.

34:17.128 --> 34:19.197
Breathe, dear. In long, out short.

34:19.463 --> 34:23.217
One in, three short.

34:23.547 --> 34:25.777
In, three out.

34:26.049 --> 34:27.562
Where are my sisters?

34:27.800 --> 34:30.792
Gideon's trying to find them, dear.
Just try to focus on the breath.

34:31.094 --> 34:32.083
In...

34:33.429 --> 34:35.737
- What happened?
- Her water's broke.

34:36.013 --> 34:37.206
She needs to get to a hospital.

34:37.429 --> 34:39.181
- Did you find them?
- No, not yet.

34:39.431 --> 34:41.991
But you can't wait any longer.
It's not safe.

34:42.264 --> 34:43.380
Go, hurry.

34:44.391 --> 34:45.871
Somebody has to stay with Wyatt.

34:50.853 --> 34:53.731
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

35:07.652 --> 35:10.371
- Nice knuckles. Brass?
- No, Tiffany's.

35:11.405 --> 35:14.317
- What a waste of a nice blue box.
- What did you say, witch?

35:15.031 --> 35:16.703
Okay, look, we didn't
come here to fight.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.588
- We just came to get Leo and Chris.
- Well, so did we.

35:19.867 --> 35:22.142
Fine, you give us ours,
we'll give you yours.

35:22.411 --> 35:24.606
Right, like we can trust you.
You're good.

35:25.328 --> 35:27.922
Wait, you can't trust us?
Who are the evil ones here?

35:28.205 --> 35:29.843
Come on, ladies.

35:30.081 --> 35:33.118
Have some hope.
We can work this out peacefully.

35:33.414 --> 35:34.813
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

35:35.624 --> 35:36.977
We'll take care of you later.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.819
We're gonna have to make a move.

35:41.043 --> 35:42.840
The longer the worlds
are out of balance...

35:43.086 --> 35:46.044
- The worse the damage is.
- We have to get everyone back.

35:46.338 --> 35:48.215
Problem is there's no talking
to those witches.

35:48.464 --> 35:50.022
I wish I could just vanquish them.

35:50.257 --> 35:52.452
Me too, but that'll really
screw up the balance.

35:52.715 --> 35:53.989
We're gonna have to settle for...

35:54.216 --> 35:56.855
Knocking them out so we can
get Leo and Chris out of here.

35:57.135 --> 35:59.251
Good.
We'll orb out and grab them...

35:59.510 --> 36:00.625
- From behind.
- Perfect.

36:08.889 --> 36:12.484
- That sucked.
- All right. I'll take mine, you take yours.

36:20.395 --> 36:21.544
Arrow.

36:21.770 --> 36:22.805
Arrow.

36:37.988 --> 36:39.467
Arrow.

36:40.864 --> 36:42.183
- Rock.
- Rock.

36:43.573 --> 36:44.926
Get down.

36:46.658 --> 36:48.410
No one can win.
They're too evenly matched.

36:48.660 --> 36:49.809
Well, they think alike.

36:51.869 --> 36:52.904
- Boulder.
- Boulder.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.712
No, no.

37:03.708 --> 37:06.347
We don't have time for this.
I gotta get back and get you home.

37:06.627 --> 37:09.585
When Gideon said something could go
wrong, I don't think he knew how wrong.

37:09.877 --> 37:12.994
- You said Gideon?
- Yeah, why?

37:13.295 --> 37:17.607
Because just maybe he did know
how wrong it could go.

37:33.097 --> 37:35.406
That won't protect you for long,
my boy.

37:35.681 --> 37:37.399
Not for long.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.592
Boulder.

38:01.692 --> 38:03.205
What do you mean?
Gideon is after Wyatt?

38:03.945 --> 38:07.779
He was desperately hoping
to eliminate Wyatt.

38:25.330 --> 38:28.003
- Piper. Hello?
- Piper. Hello?

38:28.289 --> 38:30.883
<i>Where the hell are you?
I'm in labour.</i>

38:31.165 --> 38:32.757
<i>Get your ass down here.</i>

38:32.999 --> 38:35.194
- Is she okay?
- She's in labour.

38:35.459 --> 38:38.212
<i>Who's that? You've got an echo.
What the hell is going on?</i>

38:38.502 --> 38:40.379
- I'm on my way.
- I'm on my way.

38:42.128 --> 38:44.483
- We have to go get Piper.
- And Wyatt.

38:48.757 --> 38:52.636
<i>Wanton powers in this blade, yield</i>

38:53.217 --> 38:58.814
<i>Penetrate that which would shield</i>

39:23.814 --> 39:25.805
I'm truly sorry,

39:26.065 --> 39:29.102
but this is for the greater good.

39:48.203 --> 39:50.353
<i>We call upon ancient lore</i>

39:50.619 --> 39:52.291
<i>To punish with the power of four</i>

39:52.537 --> 39:54.812
<i>Strike down this threat
From both there and here</i>

39:55.080 --> 39:58.470
<i>Make him suffer and disappear</i>

40:00.874 --> 40:02.546
- Wyatt, thank God.
- Wyatt, thank God.

40:09.670 --> 40:14.186
Did you give that bad man Gideon
those wounds?

40:14.548 --> 40:17.426
Well, looks like Wyatt
can handle himself.

40:19.842 --> 40:21.161
Yeah, but for how long?

40:21.384 --> 40:23.102
Gideon's one of the most
powerful Elders.

40:23.342 --> 40:24.980
If he wants him dead,
he'll find a way.

40:25.218 --> 40:27.334
- I can't believe it was Gideon.
- He's still out there.

40:27.594 --> 40:29.903
If he wasn't vanquished here,
he wasn't in our world either.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.035
What we need to do is get everybody
back in the right place.

40:34.307 --> 40:37.743
- Fix this whole nutty balance...
- Fix this whole nutty balance thing.

40:39.350 --> 40:40.624
I'm with you.

40:40.851 --> 40:42.489
We don't have the power of three.

40:42.726 --> 40:45.445
- No, but we do have...
- The power of four.

40:59.820 --> 41:01.173
At least we're still alive.

41:01.403 --> 41:04.076
Only because we barely
made it back here in time.

41:04.363 --> 41:06.319
Still, we healed each other
and we can try again.

41:06.573 --> 41:08.689
Especially now that we can
breach Wyatt's shield.

41:08.948 --> 41:11.098
But the sisters know about us now.

41:11.366 --> 41:13.596
Worse, the imbalance has caused
a shift in both worlds.

41:13.867 --> 41:15.778
Which we should be able
to use to our advantage

41:16.035 --> 41:18.754
to distract them
whilst we complete our task.

41:20.538 --> 41:25.089
We created the imbalance,
we should be able to repair the shift.

41:25.457 --> 41:29.086
And when we do, we'll make sure
that the sisters forget everything.

41:37.420 --> 41:38.489
Here's my brave little guy.

41:39.545 --> 41:41.979
Quick, the portal's closing.
We gotta get their men through.

41:42.255 --> 41:43.847
I'll get them.

41:44.089 --> 41:45.681
Hey, buddy. I gotcha.

41:45.924 --> 41:48.438
Okay, if the evil Piper's in labour,
our Piper must be too.

41:48.717 --> 41:51.311
- We gotta get to the hospital.
- Okay, we have to get the bag.

42:02.222 --> 42:04.133
- Hey there. How you doing?
- Hi.

42:04.390 --> 42:06.745
Okay, this is really strange.

42:07.433 --> 42:11.631
- Hi, neighbour.
- Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo, ladies.

42:11.977 --> 42:14.775
Yoo-hoo. I've been waiting for you.

42:15.062 --> 42:17.815
Mrs. Noble, hi.
I was just coming out to move the car.

42:18.939 --> 42:22.215
Oh, no, you're a busy,
busy, busy girl.

42:23.276 --> 42:26.985
Yeah, see, it's our sister, Piper,
she's in labour. We're all a little crazy.

42:27.319 --> 42:29.514
And I won't park there again,
I promise.

42:29.778 --> 42:32.246
That's right. I know you won't.

42:35.822 --> 42:37.380
Wrongs must be righted.

42:38.615 --> 42:39.764
Help!

42:39.991 --> 42:41.868
Have a super day.

42:42.451 --> 42:44.806
Help! Help, somebody. Help!

42:45.493 --> 42:47.802
Please. Someone?

42:48.078 --> 42:51.309
Someone, help.
Please, someone.

42:51.621 --> 42:53.100
Someone?

42:53.330 --> 42:55.127
Help, someone, help!

42:55.373 --> 42:59.002
Leo. Leo!

42:59.500 --> 43:00.728
Someone help!

43:00.959 --> 43:02.711
Please, someone!

43:02.960 --> 43:04.712
Leo!

43:07.690 --> 43:09.642
Put him in the playpen. I don't want him seeing this.

43:09.755 --> 43:10.366
But Phoebe ...

43:10.471 --> 43:11.051
Just do it!

43:13.013 --> 43:14.984
Ok, there you go.

43:15.490 --> 43:16.243
There you go.

43:16.343 --> 43:17.772
Don't let him out of your sight.

43:19.449 --> 43:20.810
What's wrong? What's taking so long?

43:21.165 --> 43:22.148
I don't know.

43:22.305 --> 43:24.129
Damn it, Leo, you should have just healed her outside.

43:24.356 --> 43:26.551
Right, and risk you getting shot, too? I don't think so.

43:27.953 --> 43:30.664
Ok, so I just sent our evil twins through the portal, although ...

43:32.895 --> 43:33.827
What happened?

43:35.812 --> 43:36.845
Thank god.

43:36.945 --> 43:37.705
Stay with Wyatt.

43:37.805 --> 43:38.860
I got him.

43:40.768 --> 43:41.512
You ok?

43:41.912 --> 43:45.899
Yeah. Just remind me to never park on Mrs. Noble's driveway again.

43:46.647 --> 43:48.441
Will someone please tell me what the hell is going on here?

43:48.710 --> 43:51.956
The neighborhood patrol shot her point blank
and nobody so much as blinked an eye.

43:52.655 --> 43:53.939
What? Why?

43:54.248 --> 43:55.720
Because by getting us all to the evil world,

43:55.942 --> 43:58.069
Gideon screwed up the balance, messed with the grand design.

43:58.371 --> 44:00.557
Well, if you ask me, the grand design is pretty
messed up in the first place.

44:01.081 --> 44:04.438
Wait, so are you saying because of what he did,
our world is bad now, too?

44:04.664 --> 44:06.883
No, on the contrary. It's good. Too good.

44:07.222 --> 44:10.807
Where every little infraction is a capital
offense and everyone just accepts it.

44:11.260 --> 44:13.658
Oh, so we're starring in a little movie
called "Pleasantville"?

44:15.229 --> 44:16.990
Ok, how come we weren't affected?

44:17.297 --> 44:19.725
Because we must have been crossing over when
the shift occurred.

44:20.178 --> 44:22.155
Well, that must mean Gideon's not affected, either.

44:22.444 --> 44:24.209
No, he wouldn't be because he's an Elder.

44:24.360 --> 44:26.383
How do we know he's not using the situation
to his advantage,

44:26.626 --> 44:27.851
you know, come after Wyatt again?

44:28.070 --> 44:29.274
Because I'm going to find him first.

44:29.561 --> 44:32.584
No, you can't hurt him, Leo, not until he
shifts the balance back,

44:32.697 --> 44:34.207
and you know he knows how to do that.

44:36.253 --> 44:38.931
Oh, my god. We totally forgot about Piper.
We have to get to the hospital.

44:39.333 --> 44:40.380
Who's going to watch Wyatt?

44:40.564 --> 44:44.878
I will. Look, I didn't come all the way from
the future just to lose him now, all right?

44:52.068 --> 44:54.202
I think we should drive. I don't want to risk orbing.

44:55.146 --> 44:57.696
Hey, just watch your speed, ok?

45:10.827 --> 45:12.260
Oh, give me a break!

45:13.844 --> 45:16.327
You're lucky. It could have been worse.

45:17.527 --> 45:22.237
Well, well, well, well, well, well. The new Peeping Elder.

45:22.513 --> 45:27.883
How the mighty have fallen, so to speak. Show yourself.

45:28.607 --> 45:34.154
Only if you agree to a truce. I promise,
it is in your best interests.

45:34.619 --> 45:39.570
Why not? This particular day couldn't get much worse.

45:40.996 --> 45:43.953
Actually, it could. You could die.

45:44.630 --> 45:48.660
The world has changed, my friend,
as you've obviously just witnessed.

45:49.293 --> 45:52.915
If you're referring to the witches constantly hunting me,

45:53.042 --> 45:58.756
that wouldn't happen to be some of your doing,
now would it, ... friend?

45:59.054 --> 46:01.488
Not by intent, but it's why I'm here.

46:02.732 --> 46:08.968
If I'm to shift things back to the way things were,
to give evil a fighting chance again,

46:09.243 --> 46:12.496
then you and I must work together.

46:12.788 --> 46:16.745
Now why would you want to give me a fighting chance?

46:16.982 --> 46:24.394
To restore the balance, the grand design,
as I am honor-bound to do.

46:25.526 --> 46:32.305
Just out of curiosity, how is it this, uh,
imbalance happened to occur?

46:34.952 --> 46:39.467
Come on.  You can say it.  I know you can.

46:39.567 --> 46:44.566
"I made my move on the boy, and I screwed up."

46:45.578 --> 46:47.082
I took a calculated risk.

46:47.182 --> 46:54.458
You screwed up. Now you want to hide out
down here with me,

46:54.713 --> 46:59.198
and just hope that the boy's aunties don't
know how to find you.

46:59.357 --> 47:02.289
Isn't that about right, friend?

47:02.714 --> 47:08.436
Believe me, you don't want this child growing
up any more than I do, Barbas.

47:08.987 --> 47:14.815
His power is too great. He is an enormous
threat to both of us.

47:16.391 --> 47:17.854
I see.

47:20.939 --> 47:25.098
Any shift between good and evil is supposed
to happen naturally over time.

47:26.042 --> 47:30.353
By intervening, I've allowed too much good
to corrupt the other world,

47:31.407 --> 47:37.283
and the only way to get it back is for a
Great Evil to corrupt ours.

47:37.950 --> 47:42.258
Oh, and you just naturally thought of me?
I'm very flattered.

47:42.490 --> 47:46.225
I have to complete what I started,
for everyone's sake.

47:47.656 --> 47:51.021
Help me distract the sisters ...

47:52.344 --> 47:56.075
... and I will help you get your world back.

48:01.489 --> 48:03.002
You won't find Gideon that way.

48:06.268 --> 48:07.404
We've already tried.

48:09.255 --> 48:10.831
What are you doing here?

48:10.969 --> 48:13.238
I am here to remind you of your responsibilities.

48:13.424 --> 48:15.689
My responsibilities right now are to protect my son.

48:15.857 --> 48:18.301
How, by taking revenge on one of our own?

48:18.515 --> 48:20.669
Gideon stopped being one of us when he went after Wyatt.

48:20.944 --> 48:25.807
Oh, that's not for you to decide.
You're but one voice in a chorus, Leo.

48:26.120 --> 48:28.666
We can't allow you to take matters into your own hands.

48:28.842 --> 48:29.717
Gideon did.

48:29.850 --> 48:33.207
Yes, and look what he's wrought.
The world is spiraling out of control.

48:33.383 --> 48:38.690
Innocents are being hurt - killed --
all because one Elder acted alone

48:39.417 --> 48:40.342
I know what I'm doing.

48:40.561 --> 48:42.512
Oh, Gideon thought he knew what he was doing, too.

48:43.085 --> 48:46.743
Truth be known, he was not alone in his thinking.

48:47.246 --> 48:49.792
There are others who share his fears of Wyatt,

48:49.949 --> 48:54.772
that your union with A Charmed One might've
created too great a concentration of power.

48:55.103 --> 48:56.271
Wait, so you're on his side?

48:56.462 --> 49:00.379
No, of course not. What Gideon's done is inexcusable.

49:00.682 --> 49:01.865
Then let me handle him.

49:02.291 --> 49:05.827
Please, Leo, your emotions are clouding your better judgment.

49:06.170 --> 49:09.721
The fate of the world is more important than any one child.

49:10.242 --> 49:11.775
Not more important than my son.

49:11.980 --> 49:14.642
They're all your sons, your daughters.

49:14.905 --> 49:20.124
They're who you should be protecting.
That's the greater good. Come ...

49:20.940 --> 49:24.491
help us find a way to restore what was while we still can.

49:25.932 --> 49:28.993
I can't. Not until I stop Gideon.

49:40.251 --> 49:42.305
We're all done, sir. Now, all you have
to do is pay your fine.

49:42.872 --> 49:43.613
Okay.

49:47.599 --> 49:52.028
Wow, it's, uh ... just as creepy in here
as it is out there.

49:53.033 --> 49:54.452
Actually, creepier.

49:56.047 --> 49:57.620
Ah, welcome to San Francisco Memorial.

49:57.776 --> 49:58.946
How can I help, help, help you?

49:59.332 --> 50:00.839
Well, you could take it down a notch.

50:01.907 --> 50:04.998
Ohh, she's kidding. She's a kidder.

50:05.243 --> 50:07.524
Uh, just out of curiosity, what happened here?

50:07.660 --> 50:08.719
Was it a freeway accident?

50:08.893 --> 50:12.873
Oh, heavens, no! It's always like this around here.
Lawbreakers, you know.

50:14.042 --> 50:14.801
Right.

50:15.240 --> 50:15.956
You visiting?

50:16.112 --> 50:17.446
Uh, yes. Piper Halliwell?

50:18.049 --> 50:20.659
Halliwell, Halliwell ... uh, what was her offense?

50:21.191 --> 50:23.738
Oh, no, no offense. She's having a baby.

50:24.112 --> 50:26.557
Ohh, a baby! Ohh, why didn't you say so?!

50:27.382 --> 50:28.806
'Cause we were just too excited.

50:29.225 --> 50:31.921
Oh, of course you are! There's nothing more
exciting than a baby!

50:32.649 --> 50:37.197
Uh, room 1402, but don't dawdle.
Visiting hours are almost over.

50:37.297 --> 50:39.041
You have a wonderful day, now, ok?

50:39.141 --> 50:43.955
Day? It's almost eight o'clock.
It should be dark now.

50:44.206 --> 50:47.366
Dark? Why on earth would anyone say
such a depressing thing?

50:47.817 --> 50:50.076
Imagine the sun going away, not having sunshine all the time!

50:50.298 --> 50:53.181
Anyone who'd want that should be, well -- well, shot!

50:56.118 --> 50:59.010
She's joking! That's my sister the jokester!

50:59.687 --> 51:01.872
We're going to go see our other sister now.
She's having a baby.

51:03.795 --> 51:06.155
Ok. Have a good day ... everyone.

51:19.104 --> 51:21.041
Oh, there you guys are. Where have you been?

51:21.606 --> 51:22.336
She seems normal.

51:22.474 --> 51:23.358
Come on, come in, come in.

51:24.054 --> 51:25.671
Piper ... are you ok?

51:26.337 --> 51:30.125
Of course I'm ok. I'm having a baby,
for crying out loud. Jell-o?

51:30.331 --> 51:31.267
It's really yummy.

51:31.532 --> 51:32.378
No, thanks.

51:33.482 --> 51:35.534
Excuse me. How'd you like your dinner?

51:35.833 --> 51:40.265
Are you kidding? The frozen peas and processed turkey?
It was to die for.

51:41.580 --> 51:43.060
Oh, here, let me give you a hand.

51:44.937 --> 51:45.937
Oups

51:48.131 --> 51:49.335
Piper, that's not funny.

51:49.435 --> 51:51.673
Oh, that's ok. It's my fault it even happened.

51:52.056 --> 51:53.089
Why is it your fault?

51:53.249 --> 51:54.810
Oh, I used my cell phone in the hospital.

51:55.115 --> 51:58.682
Talk about your big no-nos.
Hey, good luck with the little one.

51:59.072 --> 51:59.915
Thanks.

52:01.483 --> 52:03.012
He really should've known better.

52:03.991 --> 52:06.416
Piper, snap out of it! This is crazy-making!

52:06.693 --> 52:07.436
What is?

52:07.580 --> 52:10.709
This, everything! You, the hand, the whole damn world!

52:10.858 --> 52:12.167
It's driving me insane!

52:12.656 --> 52:15.751
Phoebe, you really should not swear.
They will cut your tongue out.

52:15.946 --> 52:17.603
Ohh! This is ridiculous.

52:18.718 --> 52:22.545
Ok, Piper, you have to listen to me.
Wyatt is in danger.

52:23.079 --> 52:24.883
What do you mean? What kind of danger?

52:25.123 --> 52:26.796
It's Gideon. He's trying to kill him.

52:31.918 --> 52:33.398
It's not funny! I'm being serious.

52:33.737 --> 52:36.999
That's ridiculous! He's an Elder.
He couldn't hurt a fly.

52:39.433 --> 52:40.068
What's so funny?

52:40.512 --> 52:41.634
Oh, don't ask.

52:42.767 --> 52:44.296
Whoopsy! That's not good.

52:44.620 --> 52:45.776
What's not good? What's going on?

52:46.012 --> 52:48.944
Those darn contractions. They're a lot more
painful than they should be.

52:49.190 --> 52:49.884
What does that mean?

52:50.033 --> 52:52.314
It means visiting hours are over. Buh-bye now.

52:52.516 --> 52:53.549
No, we're not leaving her.

52:53.678 --> 52:56.216
Oh, I'm sorry, but rules are rules.
Did you want to keep your legs?

52:58.335 --> 52:59.339
We'll call you.

52:59.496 --> 53:01.503
Okey-dokey. Ouchy!

53:04.342 --> 53:06.209
Are you sure we should leave? I'm worried about her.

53:06.452 --> 53:08.604
We have to. We can't wait for Leo.
We have to fix this.

53:08.856 --> 53:10.744
This isn't the world we want Chris to be born into.

53:11.020 --> 53:14.303
Ok, but how? Ok? Especially now that we're down a sister.

53:15.595 --> 53:17.379
Maybe we should have another little talk with ourselves.

53:24.997 --> 53:29.751
You were right. Piper's the only one of the sisters affected.

53:30.141 --> 53:33.293
And therefore the only one that can affect her sisters.

53:35.609 --> 53:37.284
She can cast a spell on them,

53:37.459 --> 53:41.444
make them think as she does so that they
won't be concerned about me either.

53:42.034 --> 53:47.269
And your theory ... is that I'm going to
make her do this. How, exactly?

53:47.608 --> 53:52.145
By doing what you do best, tapping into
her fear of losing her sisters.

53:52.477 --> 53:57.587
I don't know. She's out in cloud cuckoo-land someplace.

53:58.371 --> 54:01.518
She's in a place where she doesn't even
fear her own affliction.

54:02.450 --> 54:06.105
What makes you think she's going to fear losing a sister?

54:06.809 --> 54:10.523
Family means everything to Piper, in any world.

54:11.145 --> 54:16.022
The sooner you hit that nerve, the sooner
we both get what we want.

54:45.788 --> 54:46.549
Anything?

54:46.779 --> 54:49.340
Yeah, I thought I had him for a sec,
but then I lost him.

54:49.924 --> 54:52.027
Well, keep looking. Gideon's bound to surface again.

54:52.312 --> 54:54.324
Well, maybe you should ask the other Elders for some help.

54:55.020 --> 54:55.678
No.

54:56.771 --> 54:58.770
Huh. Trouble in paradise?

54:59.123 --> 55:00.652
Let's just say we're not seeing eye to eye.

55:02.235 --> 55:05.773
Well, then maybe you should ... I don't know, ... quit.

55:07.068 --> 55:09.763
Look, the girls are going to need another
Whitelighter the moment I'm gone anyway.

55:10.113 --> 55:11.583
That's not why you want me to quit, Chris.

55:12.983 --> 55:16.704
Ok, fine, I admit, I would like to go back to a future

55:17.104 --> 55:18.771
where my parents are still together, all right?

55:18.945 --> 55:20.790
It's just like I said when I was making the potion --

55:23.038 --> 55:24.092
The potion ...

55:24.407 --> 55:25.245
What about the potion?

55:25.360 --> 55:26.546
Well, Gideon didn't want it to work, right?

55:26.664 --> 55:29.373
But he did want us in this other world,
which means it probably does work,

55:29.520 --> 55:31.784
which means we can get you home.

55:32.479 --> 55:33.787
No. I'm not going back.

55:34.107 --> 55:34.994
Chris, you have to.

55:35.134 --> 55:39.613
Not until I finish what I came here to do,
and that's to save Wyatt from tur -

55:40.145 --> 55:41.052
-- turning evil.

55:41.521 --> 55:42.195
What?

55:43.219 --> 55:46.496
Well, what I don't understand is, if Gideon
always viewed Wyatt as a threat,

55:47.561 --> 55:49.274
why did he turn him evil in my future?

55:49.858 --> 55:51.309
I don't think he did intentionally.

55:52.428 --> 55:55.074
I think Gideon tried to kill Wyatt in your future ...

55:57.075 --> 55:59.824
only just like in this time, he found out that
Wyatt can protect himself.

56:00.055 --> 56:04.381
So, he probably had to get him away so he
could figure out how to do it.

56:04.889 --> 56:05.753
You mean kidnap him.

56:06.005 --> 56:08.365
Imagine being taken away from us for weeks,
maybe even months.

56:09.260 --> 56:10.880
Constantly fending off Gideon's attack.

56:13.984 --> 56:15.224
I had no idea.

56:15.971 --> 56:17.522
We're going to change that future, Chris ...

56:20.624 --> 56:21.867
... for both of your sakes.

56:27.309 --> 56:28.545
The Power of Four has worked before.

56:29.222 --> 56:33.266
Yep, but that was when we were in the same world.
We can't even contact them now.

56:34.696 --> 56:37.870
There must've been a way that Gideon contacted
his evil counterpart.

56:40.093 --> 56:41.193
do you hear an echo?

56:54.421 --> 56:55.825
I knew it!

56:55.925 --> 56:57.330
Nice to see you.

56:58.267 --> 56:59.816
So, is your world as messed up as ours?

57:00.048 --> 57:01.984
I've never seen everybody so miserable.

57:02.175 --> 57:03.777
It's, like, every little good thing that happens ...

57:04.067 --> 57:04.882
Gets punished.

57:05.024 --> 57:07.548
Limbs get cut off for saying gesundheit.

57:07.648 --> 57:11.119
I never thought I'd say this, but I would
kill for some daylight right now.

57:11.380 --> 57:12.897
Oh, we got plenty of it in our world.

57:13.300 --> 57:14.137
It sucks.

57:14.847 --> 57:15.769
So what do you think happened?

57:15.927 --> 57:19.312
I think we did too much good together when
we were trying to get Gideon in your world.

57:19.580 --> 57:20.907
My thoughts exactly.

57:21.172 --> 57:24.713
Maybe we need to do some serious evil on
your side to shift the balance back.

57:25.042 --> 57:25.754
Right.

57:25.854 --> 57:30.208
The problem is, I don't know if our collective
powers will work with us in different worlds.

57:30.781 --> 57:32.422
Well, we better think of something fast,

57:32.547 --> 57:35.011
because Gideon's still after Wyatt in both of them.

57:35.715 --> 57:36.639
The Power of Three.

57:36.989 --> 57:37.526
What?

57:37.626 --> 57:39.989
If we can cast a spell on our respective Pipers ...

57:40.177 --> 57:41.813
We're back to full power again.

57:42.420 --> 57:45.671
And bring us to your side so we could shift the balance back ...

57:46.105 --> 57:47.661
And then kick some ass.

57:48.505 --> 57:49.439
I like it!

57:52.417 --> 57:54.136
Security, to the prison floor.

57:54.641 --> 57:56.803
Does it hurt when I touch here?

57:56.942 --> 57:58.646
Yeow! Boy, that smarts.

57:58.984 --> 58:02.206
Huh. Well, we might be looking at a c-section here, Piper.

58:02.602 --> 58:04.998
Might be the only way to get the baby out safely.

58:05.429 --> 58:06.322
Safely?

58:07.022 --> 58:09.722
Oh, let's get another ultrasound, shall we?
I'll be right back.

58:20.592 --> 58:26.304
it would be so sad if your sisters weren't here
to help you through all this.

58:26.404 --> 58:28.309
You heard what they said about Gideon.

58:28.409 --> 58:35.408
Imagine saying such ugly lies about such a nice person.

58:38.427 --> 58:40.542
Gideon is trying to kill Wyatt. We have to stop him.

58:40.714 --> 58:43.715
No, no, no, no, no. Stop it. He's an Elder.

58:43.942 --> 58:45.084
No, Piper, he's evil.

58:45.274 --> 58:47.983
No, he's not. Now, shush, before someone hears you.

58:50.126 --> 58:52.104
No, no, no. Don't hurt them. They didn't mean it.

59:00.939 --> 59:03.472
You have to help them conform.

59:03.978 --> 59:09.811
Save them from themselves before it's too
late and you lose them ... forever.

59:18.650 --> 59:21.862
Call now ... the powers blessed be,

59:22.924 --> 59:27.463
to make my sisters happ -- happy.

59:31.702 --> 59:32.796
What are you doing here? Is Piper ok?

59:32.984 --> 59:35.096
No, but she will be, thanks to us and our evil twins.

59:35.416 --> 59:36.974
Wait, you saw them? Where?

59:37.381 --> 59:39.319
In Gideon's office. Talk about your vanity mirrors.

59:39.856 --> 59:40.694
We have a plan.

59:41.295 --> 59:44.410
Yeah, we're going to shift the world back from
Gideon so he can't use it to his advantage.

59:44.927 --> 59:45.480
How?

59:45.701 --> 59:47.062
We're going to use a spell to ...

59:50.507 --> 59:51.566
What just happened?

59:52.053 --> 59:54.117
I don't know. Are you guys all right?

59:54.590 --> 59:56.919
Yeah. Yeah. I've never felt better.

01:00:00.116 --> 01:00:02.171
Ok, so back to the plan. You were saying?

01:00:02.473 --> 01:00:05.390
Yeah, the plan was just to go see Piper in the hospital.

01:00:06.499 --> 01:00:07.533
That's a really good plan.

01:00:08.483 --> 01:00:09.451
I know.

01:00:23.458 --> 01:00:25.146
No time to dawdle. There's a baby on the way.

01:00:25.727 --> 01:00:27.363
This is crazy. You can't leave like this.

01:00:27.763 --> 01:00:30.975
Well, we can't very well ignore Chris' birth.
We have to celebrate.

01:00:31.579 --> 01:00:33.406
I'm the baby. I give you permission not to.

01:00:34.009 --> 01:00:36.008
What? And miss all the excitement?

01:00:36.158 --> 01:00:40.220
Seeing you for the first time, burping you,
picking out a name?

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:41.784
I already have a name.

01:00:42.408 --> 01:00:46.494
Oh, gosh. You do, don't you? Well, now would
be the perfect time to change.

01:00:46.825 --> 01:00:49.768
How did you get your name? It doesn't start with a "P".

01:00:50.336 --> 01:00:51.586
It was Leo's father's name.

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:54.934
... that is so sweet.

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:59.742
I can't wait to tell Piper. I'm going to get her bag.

01:01:00.178 --> 01:01:02.328
It's in the kitchen, all ready to go.

01:01:03.959 --> 01:01:07.493
Oh! You are going to be so cute!! Yes, you are.

01:01:07.593 --> 01:01:10.710
Yes, you are. Doo-doo, doo doo-doo doo.

01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:17.913
Ok. We need to snap them out of this ... fast.

01:01:18.272 --> 01:01:20.667
Piper must have cast a spell. She's the only
one who could do this to them.

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:22.532
Why would she do that?

01:01:22.675 --> 01:01:26.562
She wouldn't unless ... Gideon wanted her to,

01:01:27.151 --> 01:01:29.181
to distract them like he did before, so he can
go after Wyatt.

01:01:30.002 --> 01:01:30.984
All set!

01:01:31.084 --> 01:01:31.849
Let's go.

01:01:31.949 --> 01:01:34.656
Wait. You guys can't leave yet. Gideon might be
coming for Wyatt any minute.

01:01:34.864 --> 01:01:36.377
Oh, is he baby-sitting?

01:01:36.945 --> 01:01:40.732
No, he's trying to kill Wyatt.
Don't tell me you don't remember.

01:01:43.864 --> 01:01:47.651
You're laughing. That's great. Your nephew's almost killed,
and you're laughing.

01:01:47.893 --> 01:01:51.796
You're silly, Yes, you are. Ooh, yes, you are.

01:01:52.914 --> 01:01:54.855
Like an Elder would ever, ever do that.

01:01:55.292 --> 01:01:58.598
It must be the spell. They don't remember because
Gideon doesn't want them to.

01:01:58.929 --> 01:02:00.134
A spell? What spell?

01:02:01.368 --> 01:02:02.158
Visitors.

01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:05.472
Hey, stay with Wyatt.

01:02:06.661 --> 01:02:08.597
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Stop, stop, stop, ok?

01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:10.783
You cannot open that front door.
What happens if it's the patrolman?

01:02:11.085 --> 01:02:13.519
That's a good point. I forgot to move my car.

01:02:14.132 --> 01:02:15.130
Finally.

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:17.754
Well, I'll just have to take whatever's coming to me.

01:02:18.798 --> 01:02:19.626
What?!

01:02:21.941 --> 01:02:23.767
Hi, ladies. Chris.

01:02:23.996 --> 01:02:24.609
Hi.

01:02:25.402 --> 01:02:27.672
We thought you were the patrol guy come to shoot Phoebe.

01:02:28.024 --> 01:02:30.341
Sorry. Actually I'm here to get Chris.

01:02:30.528 --> 01:02:32.887
I'm afraid I'm going to have to take him into
custody for assaulting me.

01:02:33.072 --> 01:02:34.239
Dude, I didn't assault you.

01:02:34.398 --> 01:02:35.863
No, but Evil Chris did.

01:02:36.022 --> 01:02:36.911
That wasn't me.

01:02:37.115 --> 01:02:38.280
You're still a fugitive anyways.

01:02:38.518 --> 01:02:40.275
Ok, you're not helping, thanks.

01:02:40.531 --> 01:02:43.761
You know, I'm only giving you this chance
because we used to be friends.

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:45.973
That is so sweet, Darryl.

01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:52.214
And, evil double or no, someone has to do the time.
Take him away, Darryl.

01:02:54.136 --> 01:02:55.337
So, what? You're just going to leave?

01:02:55.683 --> 01:03:00.146
Listen, young man, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way. Your choice.

01:03:00.556 --> 01:03:02.143
I don't have time for this.

01:03:05.777 --> 01:03:06.717
Have a nice day.

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:17.554
I was thinkin' if Gideon did get to Piper,
maybe he left a trail I could follow.

01:03:18.726 --> 01:03:19.713
Hurry.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.778
If I know Leo, then right around now,

01:03:22.951 --> 01:03:25.515
he'll be figuring out that I made Piper cast the spell.

01:03:26.024 --> 01:03:29.172
A little correction: I made her cast the spell, remember?

01:03:29.676 --> 01:03:34.751
The point being, he'll go to Piper next to see
if he can't find any magical clues to find me.

01:03:35.652 --> 01:03:37.517
Find me, you mean.

01:03:37.957 --> 01:03:41.298
Actually, yes. But then again, that's what we want.

01:03:41.782 --> 01:03:42.824
Oh, really?

01:03:42.975 --> 01:03:47.906
With the sisters sufficiently distracted,
Leo is the last powerful being in my way,

01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:53.192
one who you should easily be able to distract,
whilst I make my move on Wyatt.

01:03:54.448 --> 01:03:58.599
Well, now, this all is starting to sound very interesting, but,

01:03:59.338 --> 01:04:03.768
uh, you know, it seems to me like I'm the one doing
all the heavy lifting here.

01:04:04.256 --> 01:04:05.499
Have you noticed that?

01:04:05.646 --> 01:04:06.377
Barbas!

01:04:06.498 --> 01:04:13.150
While you--you're hiding out down here, relaxing in my lair,
all safe and sound.

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:17.213
What could possibly be wrong with that picture?

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:23.478
Leo is the last impediment, I promise.
Paralyze him with his greatest fear.

01:04:23.632 --> 01:04:26.939
Keep him occupied, and we'll be one step
closer to returning the world

01:04:27.202 --> 01:04:31.400
to a place where evil at least has a chance again.

01:04:33.248 --> 01:04:40.632
Oh ... you're such a tease. Ok ... but, Gideon ...

01:04:41.259 --> 01:04:45.759
just so you know, I'm starting to lose my patience.

01:04:46.057 --> 01:04:47.080
I understand.

01:04:47.811 --> 01:04:56.395
Oh, good. Ok, now ... have you any ideas on
what a particular Elder's greatest fear might be?

01:04:57.084 --> 01:05:04.492
Don't think of him as an Elder. Think of him ... as a father.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.929
Excuse me? Uh, do you know where the maternity ward is?

01:05:23.217 --> 01:05:25.262
Are you kidding? That's everyone's favorite hangout.

01:05:25.795 --> 01:05:27.000
Just go in that elevator and -

01:05:27.202 --> 01:05:27.735
Thanks.

01:05:28.411 --> 01:05:29.266
You're welcome.

01:05:31.206 --> 01:05:31.928
Paige.

01:05:32.106 --> 01:05:35.289
Leo! Well, it's about time the nervous father
made an appearance.

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.089
Where's Phoebe? Is she with Piper?

01:05:37.435 --> 01:05:40.006
Of course. We would never leave Piper
alone at a time like this.

01:05:40.773 --> 01:05:42.397
Good, because I want to ask her if she's seen Gideon.

01:05:42.698 --> 01:05:45.020
Gideon? No, silly, not with the complication.

01:05:45.795 --> 01:05:46.729
Complication?

01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:49.215
Oh, dear. You don't know?

01:05:49.462 --> 01:05:50.466
Know what? Is something wrong?

01:05:50.686 --> 01:05:53.608
Well, I'm sure the doctors are going to find out any minute,

01:05:53.812 --> 01:05:55.827
and everything is going to be just peachy.

01:05:56.457 --> 01:05:57.276
I gotta go see her.

01:05:57.514 --> 01:05:59.694
No! That's against the hospital rules.

01:05:59.978 --> 01:06:00.792
Screw the rules.

01:06:01.178 --> 01:06:03.160
Ok ... but you're going to get in trouble.

01:06:13.988 --> 01:06:15.122
Wyatt?

01:06:16.016 --> 01:06:21.755
Watch as the thing you fear most comes to
life and the future is lost.

01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:28.921
Wyatt?

01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:31.394
What's the matter, dad? Don't you recognize me?

01:06:31.912 --> 01:06:34.713
I'm the Wyatt you're trying to save,
the one from Chris' future.

01:06:40.198 --> 01:06:44.516
You fear that there is no way
to save him, that he is lost to evil.

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.251
Excalibur!

01:06:47.228 --> 01:06:49.985
And it's your failure as a father.

01:06:50.971 --> 01:06:55.281
This isn't right. You're good.
I'm here to save you.

01:06:56.066 --> 01:06:57.870
I don't think so.

01:07:17.002 --> 01:07:18.120
Hello?

01:07:37.895 --> 01:07:39.095
Ok, it's time to get you outta here.

01:07:48.094 --> 01:07:49.793
Don't make me sacrifice you both.

01:08:10.816 --> 01:08:11.559
Dad!

01:08:24.915 --> 01:08:25.585
Dad!

01:08:27.924 --> 01:08:28.224
Chris!

01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:37.536
In trying to save one son, you have lost both sons.
Very, very sad.

01:08:37.974 --> 01:08:39.051
No-o-o-o-o!

01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:42.675
Oh, god.

01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:46.533
Uhh ... Wyatt. Uhh! Wyatt.

01:08:48.136 --> 01:08:49.377
It's for the best, Leo.

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.778
Chris? Chris?

01:09:11.609 --> 01:09:13.109
Well, finally.

01:09:14.078 --> 01:09:18.636
Now what are you doing? Would you come on?
Let's get this thing over with.

01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:24.104
Not so fast This will take some thinking,

01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:28.703
and I prefer not to get stabbed again if I can avoid it.

01:09:29.328 --> 01:09:34.477
How cute: The great big Elder's afraid of the
teeny-weeny itsy-bitsy baby.

01:09:34.889 --> 01:09:39.153
Oh, he's much more than that, trust me. Cocky, too.

01:09:39.924 --> 01:09:42.107
Notice --his shield's not even up?

01:09:42.801 --> 01:09:47.296
His shield is not up because you've pierced it already.

01:09:47.542 --> 01:09:52.412
Fools and idiots. Why is it ...

01:09:53.246 --> 01:09:56.654
that every time you want something done right, --

01:09:56.877 --> 01:09:59.220
-- you gotta do it yourself?

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:01.899
No!

01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:08.531
Slippery little devil, isn't he?

01:10:08.676 --> 01:10:10.287
Now look what you've done!

01:10:10.787 --> 01:10:12.832
Well, you didn't tell me that he could orb.

01:10:13.262 --> 01:10:15.714
I didn't know he could. That's why I wanted to be careful.

01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:18.580
not that powerful yet!

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:29.934
Well, I suppose all of this means that you've
lost your interest in fixing the world at this moment.

01:10:30.194 --> 01:10:32.764
And allow The Charmed Ones the chance to rescue him?

01:10:32.925 --> 01:10:37.593
No! The world stays exactly as it is until Wyatt is eliminated.

01:10:37.815 --> 01:10:44.448
You and I will have to work together to find him ... quickly!

01:10:44.814 --> 01:10:49.406
Or ... perhaps ... we could work together in
order to eliminate him,

01:10:49.536 --> 01:10:53.449
seeing as how much trouble you're having by yourself.

01:10:54.532 --> 01:10:58.684
Interesting. It could work, especially if you
bless the athame, too.

01:10:59.524 --> 01:11:02.021
But to try, we need to get him back!!

01:11:02.499 --> 01:11:05.199
Well, then, you track him with his orbs.

01:11:05.404 --> 01:11:08.404
Track him with his fears.

01:11:15.038 --> 01:11:16.055
You have to find Wyatt.

01:11:16.216 --> 01:11:17.550
We're going to find him together.

01:11:18.842 --> 01:11:23.574
It won't work. You've already tried.
Gideon's magic did this to me.

01:11:24.558 --> 01:11:28.937
He's the only one who can stop it. Just ... go.

01:11:30.802 --> 01:11:33.405
Saving Wyatt saves the future. You know that.

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:36.399
Gideon doesn't know how to kill Wyatt, remember?
We still have time.

01:11:37.316 --> 01:11:38.986
Only until the trauma turns him.

01:11:39.349 --> 01:11:41.954
I am not going to choose between you and Wyatt, Chris.
I can't.

01:11:42.469 --> 01:11:48.629
You don't have to, dad. Find Gideon and you save us both.

01:11:53.319 --> 01:11:55.489
All right. All right, but I'm not leaving you alone.
I'll be right back.

01:11:56.058 --> 01:11:56.976
Where are you going?

01:11:57.183 --> 01:11:58.365
To get one of your aunts to watch over you.

01:12:01.198 --> 01:12:03.337
You're going to be fine. Ok? I promise.

01:12:18.348 --> 01:12:20.368
Okay, Auntie Paige, big smile!

01:12:25.637 --> 01:12:26.402
Leo!

01:12:26.969 --> 01:12:28.512
Don't you think you should be more careful?

01:12:29.504 --> 01:12:31.297
I mean, you don't want to bring back the witch trials.

01:12:32.261 --> 01:12:33.807
Gideon got to Chris. He's hurt bad.

01:12:34.272 --> 01:12:37.870
What? Now, why would Gideon want to hurt Chris?

01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:39.389
To get to Wyatt, which he's done.

01:12:39.594 --> 01:12:43.309
Gideon is the paragon of all good. I told you that.
Remember? Smile.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.238
But he -- he's not good.

01:12:45.764 --> 01:12:49.217
He's trying to kill my sons ... your nephews.

01:12:49.381 --> 01:12:51.201
How can that be good under any circumstances?

01:12:51.374 --> 01:12:52.562
Oh, I don't know, but there --

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:53.843
You don't understand. Chris is dying!

01:12:55.645 --> 01:12:56.206
What?

01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:59.100
I have to find Gideon, but I can't leave Chris alone.

01:12:59.243 --> 01:13:00.192
Somebody has to be with him.

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:04.387
Come on, I know deep down inside
family matters to you more than this...

01:13:04.628 --> 01:13:09.243
twisted sense of right and wrong. You love him.

01:13:09.407 --> 01:13:13.444
I know you do. And that's gotta trump everything,
even this stupid spell that you're under

01:13:14.276 --> 01:13:16.834
You have to help me save him.
You have to help me save them both, please.

01:13:22.539 --> 01:13:23.642
What just happened?

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.489
I think we were under a spell and he took us out of it.

01:13:27.648 --> 01:13:28.519
Ok. Come on, let's go.

01:13:28.803 --> 01:13:32.896
No. We can't all go. Uh, Piper's being prepped for surgery.

01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:34.262
Surgery? What's the matter?

01:13:34.431 --> 01:13:35.284
They're not saying.

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:38.329
Don't worry. We're not going to lose either Chris.

01:13:39.212 --> 01:13:42.648
I'll go home; you stay here; and you...

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:44.512
...you go find Gideon.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:49.987
Chris?

01:13:56.585 --> 01:13:58.327
Easy. Easy.

01:13:58.799 --> 01:14:00.425
We got one of 'em. Stand by.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.541
Darryl, what's going on?

01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:05.718
Good day, Miss Matthews. Where's Chris?

01:14:06.386 --> 01:14:08.380
Chris? Chris who?

01:14:09.416 --> 01:14:13.179
Paige, please. We've been waiting here to
give you one last chance to turn him in...

01:14:13.833 --> 01:14:14.648
for your sake.

01:14:17.271 --> 01:14:18.437
Go to hell.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.641
Watch your tongue.

01:14:30.786 --> 01:14:32.422
He's got to be hiding in the underworld.

01:14:32.749 --> 01:14:35.391
I agree. It's the only place he can go to avoid being sensed.

01:14:35.728 --> 01:14:37.667
Which means he must have both of our Wyatts there, too.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.322
Still, it's too vast. We have to narrow it down.

01:14:40.578 --> 01:14:44.106
Wait. It is too vast. For Gideon, too, right?

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:45.845
Somebody's got to be helping him.

01:14:46.493 --> 01:14:47.337
But who?

01:14:47.724 --> 01:14:49.321
Whoever helped him get to Piper in the hospital.

01:14:49.774 --> 01:14:51.416
I went to the hospital and tried to pick up a trail ...

01:14:51.735 --> 01:14:52.750
... but I was overwhelmed with ...

01:14:53.264 --> 01:14:54.497
- Hope.
- Fear.

01:14:54.996 --> 01:14:55.845
Barbas.

01:14:56.408 --> 01:14:57.534
So, if we find Barbas ...

01:14:57.675 --> 01:14:58.655
We'll find Gideon.

01:14:58.825 --> 01:14:59.781
For both of our sons.

01:15:14.768 --> 01:15:15.640
Check it out.

01:15:16.521 --> 01:15:17.796
How'd he get down here?

01:15:18.537 --> 01:15:21.391
Maybe the world's finally turning back in our favor.

01:15:28.635 --> 01:15:29.828
Or not.

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:41.571
Damn.

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:48.770
Ah! Missed him by that much.

01:15:49.954 --> 01:15:52.057
Leo! Leo!

01:15:54.003 --> 01:15:55.964
Sorry. I was in the underworld looking for ...

01:15:57.158 --> 01:15:58.021
-- what's wrong?

01:16:02.539 --> 01:16:04.422
What's going on? What the hell are you doing here?

01:16:04.878 --> 01:16:06.555
Nothing. We didn't have to.

01:16:08.144 --> 01:16:09.333
I'm sorry, Leo.

01:16:15.594 --> 01:16:16.375
Chris.

01:16:17.817 --> 01:16:22.535
Hey. I'm here now. You can ... hold on, ok?
Hold on ... hold on.

01:16:23.767 --> 01:16:28.793
I'm here. You can hold on, okay?
Don't give up, okay?

01:16:29.746 --> 01:16:30.840
You, either.

01:16:36.165 --> 01:16:38.967
No, no, no. Please ... no.

01:16:40.253 --> 01:16:41.649
No, please.

01:16:42.104 --> 01:16:42.583
No.

01:17:26.498 --> 01:17:27.639
Leo, stop it!

01:17:29.153 --> 01:17:31.950
What are you trying to do, kill us?
This isn't going to bring him back.

01:17:32.967 --> 01:17:34.943
I promised him I'd get him home safely.

01:17:35.708 --> 01:17:39.275
I know, but you can still save his future,
and you can still save Wyatt.

01:17:39.402 --> 01:17:42.441
We just have to hurry, and you have to focus.

01:17:43.254 --> 01:17:46.961
Ok? Look, you were saying something about the underworld,

01:17:47.106 --> 01:17:49.348
about looking for something there. What?

01:17:51.498 --> 01:17:52.124
Barbas.

01:17:53.192 --> 01:17:54.868
Barbas? What's he got to do with this?

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:58.914
He's working with Gideon. That's how I think he got to Piper.

01:17:59.078 --> 01:18:01.895
That's ... how I think he got to me.

01:18:02.223 --> 01:18:04.407
Gideon teamed up with a demon for that?

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.659
No. An act of Great Evil in our world restores the balance.

01:18:11.323 --> 01:18:13.323
That's what I think he was using Barbas for.

01:18:14.328 --> 01:18:16.320
So, they're working together.

01:18:17.971 --> 01:18:20.800
That means they must be in contact with each other, right?

01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:22.519
So?

01:18:22.771 --> 01:18:25.639
So, that means maybe that's a way to find Gideon.

01:18:25.773 --> 01:18:28.201
The next time they try to contact each other,
you just intercept it.

01:18:33.993 --> 01:18:40.717
Wyatt? Wyatt? Can you hear me? It's daddy. Wyatt?

01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:43.890
Wyatt, can you hear me? It's daddy.

01:18:52.087 --> 01:18:53.168
Hello, son.

01:18:55.934 --> 01:19:01.435
So sorry to lure you like this. Barbas ... where are you?

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:03.863
Barbas!

01:19:10.792 --> 01:19:11.904
It's time.

01:19:12.786 --> 01:19:14.852
Took you long enough.

01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:18.449
Your impatience is growing tiresome.

01:19:19.958 --> 01:19:23.408
I blessed it already. Now it's your turn.

01:19:26.894 --> 01:19:28.347
Is something wrong?

01:19:30.567 --> 01:19:32.077
As a matter of fact ...

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.696
... there is.

01:19:47.076 --> 01:19:48.463
Why?

01:19:49.306 --> 01:19:52.956
Because ... you murdered my son.

01:19:57.681 --> 01:19:59.105
I'll be right back.

01:20:02.194 --> 01:20:04.098
Leo, please, you have to understand.

01:20:04.517 --> 01:20:07.954
I am only doing this for the greater good. I swear.

01:20:09.677 --> 01:20:11.889
How is killing a child ever for the greater good, huh?

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.635
Who the hell are you to decide that, huh?

01:20:19.202 --> 01:20:21.581
I'm an Elder! So are you! It's what we do.

01:20:22.071 --> 01:20:23.173
I'm not one of you anymore.

01:20:23.511 --> 01:20:25.194
Leo, listen to me. You know what happens.

01:20:25.517 --> 01:20:27.370
You know what Chris came here to stop.

01:20:31.301 --> 01:20:35.333
Let me finish what I started. Let me save the future...

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:38.083
the only way it can be saved.

01:20:38.504 --> 01:20:42.113
You're the reason the future's threatened,
Gideon ... not Wyatt ...

01:20:42.634 --> 01:20:43.297
No --

01:20:43.535 --> 01:20:44.740
... but because of what you do to him.

01:20:45.551 --> 01:20:48.165
I'm about to make sure neither one of
you get the chance again. Mirror!

01:20:51.037 --> 01:20:51.925
You ready?

01:20:52.125 --> 01:20:55.127
Remember ... you can't do anything.
I have to do this alone.

01:20:55.505 --> 01:20:56.474
I know.

01:20:57.692 --> 01:20:58.995
Do--do what?

01:20:59.267 --> 01:21:00.593
A Great Evil.

01:21:15.257 --> 01:21:17.406
Fade away? What--what do you mean,
he just faded away?

01:21:18.071 --> 01:21:19.921
In Leo's arms, after he died.

01:21:21.113 --> 01:21:23.813
Yeah, maybe he didn't die. I mean,
maybe he was just going back ...

01:21:26.804 --> 01:21:31.259
Oh, god. Ohh. Poor Leo.

01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:38.646
Dr. Roberts ... how's Piper?

01:21:38.938 --> 01:21:40.726
Well, that depends on how you look at it,
I suppose.

01:21:41.585 --> 01:21:43.618
Me, I like to think she's moving
off to a better place.

01:21:44.281 --> 01:21:45.172
What?!

01:21:45.373 --> 01:21:46.466
What is that supposed to mean?

01:21:46.732 --> 01:21:49.583
Well, I think you know what I mean.
She's hemorrhaging.

01:21:50.326 --> 01:21:52.206
We can't stop it.  It's everywhere.

01:21:52.763 --> 01:21:54.763
But let's all try to think positively,
shall we?

01:21:54.969 --> 01:21:55.860
Now you listen to me.

01:21:56.145 --> 01:22:01.027
You get your ass back in that room and
you save my sister and her baby! You understand me?!

01:22:01.982 --> 01:22:02.905
Security!

01:22:05.823 --> 01:22:07.616
Okay. They shoot people here, remember?

01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:09.993
We got to get Piper out of here.
We've got to get her to Leo.

01:22:10.332 --> 01:22:11.923
We can't. We don't know where Leo is.

01:22:12.439 --> 01:22:13.577
We can't just do nothing!

01:22:17.514 --> 01:22:18.947
What's going on?

01:22:33.623 --> 01:22:34.805
Phoebe, it's night.

01:22:37.441 --> 01:22:38.806
Everything's back to normal?

01:22:42.018 --> 01:22:46.185
I'll do everything I can. I promise.
Excuse me.

01:22:49.176 --> 01:22:50.576
Leo must've done something.

01:23:03.906 --> 01:23:08.959
You have no idea ... what you've done.

01:23:15.519 --> 01:23:17.161
Didn't know you had it in you.

01:23:17.633 --> 01:23:19.271
Our worlds can never cross over again.

01:23:20.734 --> 01:23:21.921
Take care of your family.

01:23:22.702 --> 01:23:23.679
You, too.

01:23:43.556 --> 01:23:45.558
I got you. You're safe now.

01:23:47.023 --> 01:23:53.915
I have you. I have you.

01:24:02.021 --> 01:24:03.080
He found him.

01:24:06.705 --> 01:24:07.538
Is he ok?

01:24:07.773 --> 01:24:10.183
Yeah. He wasn't with Gideon long enough
to do any damage.

01:24:11.099 --> 01:24:12.069
What happened to Gideon?

01:24:16.048 --> 01:24:17.301
How's Piper?

01:24:18.031 --> 01:24:19.255
She's resting comfortably.

01:24:21.224 --> 01:24:22.230
Is she okay?

01:24:22.667 --> 01:24:25.642
We stopped the bleeding, obviously had
to perform a c-section,

01:24:25.818 --> 01:24:27.506
but I think she's going to be ok.

01:24:29.044 --> 01:24:30.443
And the baby ... is he all right?

01:24:31.696 --> 01:24:32.965
You tell me.

01:24:41.526 --> 01:24:43.870
Congratulations. He's perfectly healthy.

01:24:44.464 --> 01:24:45.430
Really?

01:24:45.803 --> 01:24:50.912
Oh, look ... he's beautiful. Baby Christopher.

01:24:54.661 --> 01:24:56.227
That's your brother.

01:24:58.111 --> 01:24:59.830
Looks like we didn't lose him after all.

01:25:08.602 --> 01:25:09.702
Can we see Piper?

01:25:11.266 --> 01:25:13.224
Well, maybe just one of you for now.

01:25:16.266 --> 01:25:18.240
Go tell her we love her.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.340
Where'd the baby go? That's your brother.
