00:00.083 --> 00:02.041
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.125 --> 00:03.750
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm in love with you.

00:03.875 --> 00:06.709
<i>Victor caught Gabby by surprise.</i>

00:06.792 --> 00:09.625
Why would a four-star chef wanna slum
at a pizza joint?

00:09.709 --> 00:12.667
<i>- Lynette took a gamble.</i>
- He has a history using cocaine.

00:12.792 --> 00:15.125
- No. No way.
- He's been clean for almost a year.

00:15.208 --> 00:18.709
<i>- Mike bet on love.</i>
- I win, you leave me and Susan alone.

00:18.792 --> 00:20.792
<i>- And lost.</i>
- Don't panic.

00:20.875 --> 00:23.750
<i>But still came to Susan's rescue.</i>

00:23.834 --> 00:26.166
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:26.959 --> 00:31.667
<i>And Mrs McCluskey revealed</i>
<i>her secret for a lasting relationship.</i>

00:33.834 --> 00:39.041
<i>It was late on a Tuesday night when</i>
<i>the power went out all over Fairview.</i>

00:40.709 --> 00:45.166
<i>For most of the residents,</i>
<i>it was a minor inconvenience,</i>

00:45.250 --> 00:46.959
<i>but for those with secrets,</i>

00:47.041 --> 00:50.625
<i>the darkness proved quite useful,</i>
<i>indeed.</i>

00:52.375 --> 00:57.041
<i>Millie Russell was able to indulge</i>
<i>in another night of midnight binging.</i>

00:57.875 --> 01:00.875
<i>Timmy Cooper was able</i>
<i>to sneak another peek</i>

01:00.959 --> 01:04.333
<i>at his father's adult magazines.</i>

01:04.417 --> 01:09.959
<i>Marilyn Quinn was able to steal a few</i>
<i>more puffs of her forbidden tobacco.</i>

01:12.375 --> 01:15.542
<i>But these secrets paled</i>
<i>compared to the one</i>

01:15.625 --> 01:19.083
<i>a certain old woman</i>
<i>was hiding in her basement.</i>

01:19.166 --> 01:22.250
You sit tight, Ida. I got batteries here.

01:22.917 --> 01:26.542
I keep them in the freezer for just such
an emergency. I'll run them over to you.

01:28.792 --> 01:31.458
By the way, you wouldn't happen
to have any extra ice laying around,

01:31.542 --> 01:33.250
would you?

01:33.333 --> 01:38.542
No, I just got some stuff in my freezer
I don't want thawing out any time soon.

01:39.333 --> 01:45.333
<i>Yes, as a rule, darkness helps us</i>
<i>keep our secrets safely hidden.</i>

01:45.625 --> 01:47.250
Oh, crap!

01:54.875 --> 01:57.250
<i>But every rule...</i>

01:57.333 --> 01:59.750
<i>Karen, what's happened?</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:59.834 --> 02:02.250
<i>...has its exceptions.</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:49.375
<i>When the lights went out</i>
<i>on Wisteria Lane,</i>

02:49.458 --> 02:54.500
<i>Karen McCluskey wasn't</i>
<i>the only resident left in the dark.</i>

02:54.583 --> 02:59.125
<i>Everyone else felt the pain</i>
<i>of going without power as well.</i>

03:01.250 --> 03:02.917
Damn thumbtack!

03:03.000 --> 03:06.542
- Susan, please let me help you.
- Oh, no, I got it.

03:07.041 --> 03:10.375
Wait, here we go.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
But it's hardly a long-term solution.

03:15.083 --> 03:18.792
Well, at least it will keep me
from stabbing myself while I look.

03:18.917 --> 03:21.917
This is silly. Why don't we just borrow
a flashlight from Mike?

03:23.333 --> 03:24.959
- Mike?
- He's a plumber.

03:25.041 --> 03:26.792
He's bound to have a spare.

03:26.875 --> 03:31.125
Sure, but we can't keep leaning on him
for everything.

03:31.208 --> 03:33.667
"Mike, we're drowning, save us!
Mike, it's dark, give us a flashlight!"

03:33.750 --> 03:34.917
Let's go ask Gabby.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.417
Actually, I was wanting to talk
to him anyway.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.417
I thought we might ask him
over for dinner.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.041
Dinner?

03:41.125 --> 03:43.500
You know, as a thank-you gesture.

03:43.583 --> 03:47.000
Well, Ian, you've tasted my cooking.
It's not a thank you. It's revenge.

03:47.083 --> 03:49.125
Well, then I'll cook.

03:49.208 --> 03:51.417
You know, you told me
I should put my jealousy behind me.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.542
I think breaking bread together
would be a great start.

03:53.625 --> 03:55.959
Well, let's not bother him tonight.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.750
You know, I don't really even
need a flashlight.

03:57.834 --> 04:00.750
My eyes have totally adjusted
to the dark.

04:02.959 --> 04:06.375
- What was that?
- Don't walk in the kitchen.

04:06.458 --> 04:10.750
Anyway, where is
your sense of romance?

04:10.834 --> 04:14.750
It's a blackout,
you have a defenceless lady...

04:14.834 --> 04:18.917
- Getting any ideas?
- Well, I'm starting to, yes.

04:19.458 --> 04:20.750
It's funny,

04:20.834 --> 04:23.959
all that time I wasted worrying
Mike would come between us,

04:25.250 --> 04:27.959
it seems so laughable now, doesn't it?

04:30.500 --> 04:32.542
Kiss me.

04:35.959 --> 04:39.583
Hey, Carlos, we had a blackout.
You need a flashlight?

04:41.792 --> 04:43.500
Carlos? You okay?

04:46.834 --> 04:50.417
Oh, sorry, man.
I thought I heard a thud.

04:50.542 --> 04:53.542
I just bumped into a chair.

04:55.959 --> 04:58.583
I didn't think that you were
coming home till tomorrow.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.875
No, the fish weren't biting.

05:01.125 --> 05:05.000
So, you got a girl in here?

05:05.083 --> 05:06.500
No. Why?

05:06.583 --> 05:10.875
Oh, because when I came home
I thought I heard sex noises.

05:11.083 --> 05:12.750
No, that was just me.

05:15.917 --> 05:18.417
Okay, good night.

05:20.750 --> 05:21.917
God, that was close.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.917
All this sneaking around is ridiculous.

05:26.041 --> 05:30.709
Mike and I dated for five minutes.

05:30.792 --> 05:33.959
- He's not gonna care.
- What if Travers finds out?

05:34.041 --> 05:38.166
Look, I don't want him to be confused.
Until we figure out where this is going,

05:38.250 --> 05:41.875
I just think we should keep things
on the down low.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.083
Hey, I didn't say we had to stop,
I just said we had to be quiet.

05:45.166 --> 05:47.917
What, I suppose we should tiptoe
around like school children

05:48.000 --> 05:50.333
so our parents don't catch us doing it?

05:50.417 --> 05:51.875
I feel like I'm 12 again.

05:51.959 --> 05:55.166
I'm just saying, I don't think that
the whole world needs to know our...

05:55.250 --> 05:58.250
- Twelve?
- Okay, look.

05:58.333 --> 06:01.583
I will find us another place
to rendezvous.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.000
But I'm not gonna skulk around forever.

06:05.125 --> 06:09.625
Okay, and no one's asking you to.
I respect you too much for that.

06:15.917 --> 06:19.000
- If you don't mind.
- Oh, for God's sake.

06:32.792 --> 06:36.041
I'm going to be right there.
Here you go.

06:36.125 --> 06:38.625
So can you still cook
with the power out?

06:38.709 --> 06:41.542
Of course. Absolutely!

06:41.625 --> 06:43.750
Please, please tell me
we can still make pizza.

06:43.834 --> 06:44.875
No dice.

06:44.959 --> 06:47.959
Some genius installed pizza ovens
with electric starters.

06:48.041 --> 06:51.792
Oh, this is awful.
On a good night we barely break even.

06:51.875 --> 06:54.750
Tonight is going to kill the whole week.

06:56.041 --> 06:59.041
Not necessarily. The stovetop's gas,

06:59.125 --> 07:01.875
I bought pasta for the staff dinner.
You give me 10 minutes,

07:01.959 --> 07:05.875
I'll whip up a spaghetti carbonara
that'll knock their socks off.

07:08.625 --> 07:12.458
Oh, my God, you are a lifesaver.

07:12.542 --> 07:16.041
And since it's not on the menu,
you can charge whatever you want.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.166
Say, 20 bucks.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.959
- For pasta? Are you crazy?
- Won't hurt to ask.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.083
I don't want to scare them away.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.959
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.333
So, good news.

07:29.417 --> 07:32.458
Our chef is preparing
his special spaghetti carbonara.

07:32.542 --> 07:35.542
- Oh, yummy.
- And we're offering that for $12.

07:35.625 --> 07:38.417
- Great.
- For the appetizer portion.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.917
- The entree is 20...
- Fine.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.458
...two. Twenty-two. Okay.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.375
Shouldn't there be an emergency light?

07:52.458 --> 07:54.959
Sometimes in these elevators
there's a...

07:56.333 --> 07:58.083
Well, aren't you clever?

07:58.166 --> 08:00.000
I'll just call hotel security,
let them know...

08:00.083 --> 08:01.750
No, wait.

08:01.834 --> 08:04.125
This is the first time
I've had you to myself all night.

08:04.208 --> 08:06.375
You know, I'm sorry.
It's those fundraisers.

08:06.458 --> 08:08.667
Everybody wants
a piece of the candidate...

08:08.750 --> 08:12.000
- What are you doing?
- Taking my piece.

08:12.792 --> 08:16.041
- Are you insane? We're in an elevator.
- Exactly.

08:16.125 --> 08:19.458
- Going down...
- Oh, no. Come on, cut it out.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.208
The power could come on
at any moment.

08:22.291 --> 08:26.125
I know. That's what makes
it so exciting. The risk.

08:26.208 --> 08:29.291
But I'm kind of running for mayor here,
remember?

08:29.375 --> 08:32.792
It's an elevator, silly.
It has an emergency stop button.

08:34.917 --> 08:36.875
I don't.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.375
Oh, my God, that's amazing.
What are you doing?

08:47.458 --> 08:50.041
That's my phone. It's on vibrate.

08:51.417 --> 08:54.417
Oh, man,
I was just starting to get into it.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.417
Less talking and more dressing!

09:02.291 --> 09:06.500
- You two okay?
- Yeah, fine, thanks.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.125
Must've gotten pretty hot in there.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.917
You have no idea.

09:24.083 --> 09:27.458
Karen, don't worry about a thing.
I'll collect your mail till you get back.

09:27.542 --> 09:29.917
How long's this blackout
supposed to last?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.083
- Well, they say it may last for days.
- Days?

09:34.083 --> 09:36.250
Hey, blondie, come here, come here.

09:36.333 --> 09:39.125
Listen, I don't really need to go to
the hospital. I'm fine.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.166
You fractured a rib
and you might have a concussion.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.500
You need looking after.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.333
Some of the stuff
in my freezer might melt.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.542
How about I just run out and get some
ice and then meet you at the hospital?

09:47.625 --> 09:50.750
- Ma'am, you can replace groceries.
- You don't understand.

09:50.959 --> 09:54.458
Some of my groceries,
they have sentimental value.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.750
- Sorry.
- I don't need to ask your permission.

09:56.834 --> 10:00.000
- Ma'am, no!
- Get your hands off me, you big ape!

10:01.709 --> 10:05.375
- Get the restraints!
- I'm gonna sue your ass!

10:15.750 --> 10:16.792
Well, what are we waiting for?

10:16.875 --> 10:19.834
Get me to the hospital.
I'm not a well woman.

10:22.875 --> 10:24.458
What was that all about?

10:24.542 --> 10:27.834
Your friend's afraid the stuff
in her freezer is gonna spoil.

10:27.917 --> 10:31.667
Thank God the power's back on.
Now she won't have to worry.

10:52.208 --> 10:56.458
I made you waffles.
Eat them while they're hot.

11:02.917 --> 11:04.750
What?

11:05.583 --> 11:07.250
Will you marry me?

11:08.834 --> 11:10.959
They're just toaster waffles.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.750
That was just the pre-proposal,
actually.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.250
The real one
will be much more romantic

11:15.333 --> 11:17.291
with a big diamond
the size of a doorknob.

11:17.375 --> 11:20.333
But just so you're prepared,
I do want to marry you.

11:20.417 --> 11:23.291
Well, just so you're prepared,
consider this my pre-refusal.

11:23.375 --> 11:24.458
Come on. What's wrong?

11:24.542 --> 11:26.875
You wear my shirts, you burn
my breakfast, you're here every night.

11:26.959 --> 11:28.959
It's like we're married already.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.250
We're having a good time.
Why risk ruining it?

11:31.333 --> 11:34.500
What happened to the thrill-seeker
that seduced me in the elevator?

11:34.583 --> 11:36.667
She wouldn't be afraid
of taking a little risk.

11:36.792 --> 11:40.208
Oh, you don't want to marry her.
She's a tramp. Hold out for a good girl.

11:40.291 --> 11:43.667
No, no, no. I found what I'm looking for.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.917
Come on. What gives?

11:47.792 --> 11:52.667
Look, Victor, getting divorced
really kicked my ass.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.083
I'm sorry, it's just...

11:56.166 --> 11:58.667
Next time I get married,
I've got to be sure.

11:59.959 --> 12:02.291
Okay, I get it.

12:02.375 --> 12:05.500
I just wish there was a way I could
prove how much I love and adore you.

12:05.583 --> 12:08.542
Well, if you can choke down
that lousy waffle I made you,

12:08.625 --> 12:10.166
that'd be a start.

12:28.542 --> 12:30.250
Oh, there's Mike.

12:31.583 --> 12:35.500
- Shall we see if he's free Friday night?
- Yeah. Yeah, why not?

12:35.583 --> 12:36.750
Sure.

12:36.834 --> 12:40.750
You know what? Do you want to run
this ice cream inside before it melts?

12:49.959 --> 12:52.667
Look, Ian is going to come invite
you to dinner Friday,

12:52.750 --> 12:55.000
and you are not, I repeat,
not going to accept.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.583
Why is Ian inviting me to dinner?

12:58.667 --> 13:00.125
He wants to thank you for saving us

13:00.208 --> 13:02.458
and he wants to show that
he's not jealous of you.

13:02.542 --> 13:06.291
- How's that for irony?
- I didn't plan to kiss you,

13:06.375 --> 13:09.625
- but you didn't exactly resist.
- I was in shock!

13:10.083 --> 13:12.625
Why were you so upset
when you mentioned Ian?

13:12.709 --> 13:15.083
Because we had just had a fight

13:15.750 --> 13:17.000
about you.

13:17.083 --> 13:20.166
Really? You talk about me a lot?

13:20.250 --> 13:22.125
Mike, I am marrying Ian.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.291
We have hired a caterer.

13:23.375 --> 13:26.542
We are going with the salmon!
So just back off!

13:26.625 --> 13:30.250
- Hey, Ian.
- Hi, Ian. I just asked Mike.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.792
- He can't make it.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

13:32.875 --> 13:36.250
- I've got plans tonight.
- Oh, but didn't we say Friday?

13:36.333 --> 13:38.834
Friday? Oh, Friday I'm wide open.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.625
- Splendid. Shall we say, 7:30?
- It's a date.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.125
- Edie!
- Mrs Epstein!

13:58.208 --> 14:01.291
Listen, I'm late for
my Hadassah meeting. Here's the key.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.959
Take your time. Oh, and don't be shy.

14:04.041 --> 14:07.458
Check out those closets,
they're very spacious.

14:09.834 --> 14:12.792
- Edie, what are we doing here?
- Checking out a house.

14:13.709 --> 14:15.542
I told you,
I'm not looking to buy right now.

14:15.625 --> 14:19.917
Who's talking about buying anything?
I am giving it away.

14:20.959 --> 14:23.917
Edie, we cannot have sex in here.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.125
It's someone else's bed.
That's just wrong!

14:26.208 --> 14:29.041
We can't use my place,
we can't use yours.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.917
I'll be damned
if I am going to pay for a hotel room

14:32.000 --> 14:34.625
when there are
all of these empty houses all over town

14:34.709 --> 14:38.250
that I have the keys to.

14:38.333 --> 14:43.917
<i>Though reluctant at first, Carlos soon</i>
<i>saw the wisdom in Edie's plan.</i>

14:44.291 --> 14:47.417
<i>Secret affairs are a lot like real estate.</i>

14:47.500 --> 14:49.542
<i>The three keys to success are</i>

14:49.625 --> 14:51.375
<i>location,</i>

14:51.458 --> 14:53.083
<i>location,</i>

14:53.917 --> 14:56.041
<i>location.</i>

14:59.500 --> 15:02.041
- Okay.
- Careful. I can't sit down that fast.

15:02.125 --> 15:04.333
I'm sorry, but it's gonna be worth it.

15:04.417 --> 15:07.291
Okay, so tell Tom
the secret of your risotto.

15:07.375 --> 15:10.875
Well, I sauté spinach and onions
in white wine.

15:10.959 --> 15:13.458
No, no, the profit margin.

15:13.542 --> 15:15.709
Basically, it costs a dollar to make...

15:15.792 --> 15:16.917
And we charge 20!

15:17.000 --> 15:19.333
So, four people
who would've shared a $15 pizza

15:19.417 --> 15:21.667
are now spending 80 bucks.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.417
Okay kids, dig in.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.917
There's just one little problem
with that, Lynette.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.041
Yeah.

15:30.125 --> 15:32.959
Those families you're talking about
have kids.

15:33.041 --> 15:35.875
And there's no kid that's gonna eat
anything with spinach in it.

15:35.959 --> 15:37.625
Tom?

15:43.291 --> 15:47.166
- It's delicious, huh?
- Yeah.

15:47.250 --> 15:50.000
Yeah?
Rick learned how to make this in Italy.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.959
Go ahead. Try it.
I want to see what you think.

16:04.542 --> 16:06.750
- It's good.
- It's awesome.

16:06.834 --> 16:08.166
It's good.

16:10.709 --> 16:14.834
- But?
- But it's just not us.

16:14.917 --> 16:17.000
"Us"? What is "us"?

16:17.083 --> 16:20.291
Look, we're a neighbourhood
pizza place. We serve pizza.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.792
I like this better.
I'm getting bored of pizza.

16:22.875 --> 16:25.125
Porter, the adults are talking.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.500
Look, we serve good food
at good prices.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.750
We're not looking to be
the next trendy flash-in-the-pan.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.250
That's not what I'm looking for, either.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.375
You see, my food,
it's not trendy, it's classic.

16:35.458 --> 16:39.583
Rick... Obviously, you're a great cook,

16:39.667 --> 16:42.750
and when you have your own place,
I will definitely eat there.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.959
But I see no reason
to change my menu.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.667
More, please.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.709
Hi. Can I help you?

17:10.208 --> 17:12.667
Yeah. I'm here to see Mr Lang.

17:12.750 --> 17:15.041
He's not here. Is that for him?

17:16.417 --> 17:20.291
- Yeah, but it's very personal.
- Okay.

17:20.417 --> 17:23.166
I don't think I should leave it
with the maid.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.250
Do I look like the maid? Give me that!

17:47.667 --> 17:50.375
You! Blackmailer!

17:50.458 --> 17:52.709
Oh, man.
You weren't supposed to look.

18:01.166 --> 18:02.750
Get off me!

18:04.667 --> 18:06.834
Fifty thousand dollars?
Are you insane?

18:06.917 --> 18:09.709
- That's not for you to decide.
- I want all negatives of those photos

18:09.792 --> 18:12.583
- or I start breaking fingers!
- No, you can't break my fingers.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.542
Come on!

18:15.291 --> 18:17.875
- Give me the pictures!
- Hey, hey. Hey, break it up.

18:17.959 --> 18:21.125
- Break it up. Come on. Come on.
- She's crazy! She's crazy!

18:21.291 --> 18:23.583
That's for calling me a maid!

18:29.291 --> 18:32.750
He works the hotel security monitors.
That's how he got the photos.

18:32.834 --> 18:35.291
That miserable cockroach.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.625
If you want to smack him
around a little,

18:36.709 --> 18:38.583
I can go inside and turn up the radio.

18:38.667 --> 18:41.959
Again, no, thank you.
But I will need those photos.

18:42.041 --> 18:45.500
Oh, no. I'm going to hang onto these.
They're a little revealing.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.083
Ma'am, we can't charge him
without evidence.

18:47.166 --> 18:51.041
And if he walks, he can do what
he wants with the originals.

18:52.041 --> 18:53.959
Okay, yeah.

18:54.041 --> 18:56.875
But guard them with your life.

18:59.291 --> 19:01.041
Yeah. Especially that one.

19:03.208 --> 19:07.583
We've been open for three months now
and we've barely turned a profit!

19:07.667 --> 19:10.750
We are building a customer base.
That takes time.

19:10.834 --> 19:14.750
- Go on, ask her.
- No, you ask her.

19:14.834 --> 19:17.083
Why are you being so stubborn?

19:17.166 --> 19:20.625
You would rather see the restaurant fail
than succeed with Rick's idea.

19:20.709 --> 19:24.208
And I can't believe that you two
are ready to toss out my concept.

19:24.291 --> 19:27.375
Yeah, why don't you just re-name
the restaurant Lynette and Rick's?

19:27.458 --> 19:31.375
- Can we have Fudgsicles?
- No!

19:31.458 --> 19:35.333
Sorry, Lynette, but the menu
is not changing. End of discussion.

19:35.417 --> 19:38.458
I don't think so. I'm giving it a try.

19:40.333 --> 19:43.542
- That's not your decision to make.
- Yeah?

19:43.667 --> 19:45.875
Well, then why don't you come down
to the restaurant and stop me?

19:45.959 --> 19:48.250
Oh, that's right. You can't.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.959
I told you she'd say no.

19:56.458 --> 19:59.583
Mrs McCluskey always
has some Fudgsicles.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.291
Yeah, but she's in the hospital.

20:47.667 --> 20:50.709
Where's the ice cream?

20:50.792 --> 20:53.875
- She didn't have any.
- Man!

20:54.458 --> 20:57.083
There wasn't anything good in there?

20:57.166 --> 20:58.291
No.

21:22.792 --> 21:24.125
What the hell were you thinking?

21:24.208 --> 21:26.875
How was I to know the cops were going
to release the photos to the press?

21:26.959 --> 21:28.041
Everybody in town knows

21:28.125 --> 21:30.208
the police chief is the mayor's
brother-in-law! Everyone!

21:30.250 --> 21:31.375
Enough, Jerome!

21:31.458 --> 21:32.625
I want you to organise
a press conference

21:32.709 --> 21:34.083
and then I want you
to help me prep for it.

21:34.166 --> 21:36.959
Well, this is going to be a bloodbath.
I don't know how you're gonna prep.

21:37.041 --> 21:40.834
Just get me a bucket of piranhas,
and I'll stick my head in it.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.875
You know, you're a single guy.
Maybe people won't care.

21:49.959 --> 21:53.917
I'm running a family values campaign
and I had sex in an elevator.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.792
I think they will care.

21:59.208 --> 22:02.875
Look, I know this is my fault, so if
you want to bite my head off, go ahead.

22:03.041 --> 22:04.125
You know, Gabby,

22:04.208 --> 22:05.875
there are only two things
that matter to me these days.

22:05.959 --> 22:08.583
My campaign and you.

22:08.667 --> 22:13.375
And if I had to lose one of them,
I'd rather it was the campaign.

22:18.375 --> 22:20.542
Is there anything I can do?

22:21.583 --> 22:24.166
Yeah, you can stick around
on election night.

22:24.250 --> 22:27.417
I have a feeling I'm going to need
some serious consoling.

22:33.542 --> 22:37.709
- God, that is so good.
- I know. It's hard to decide, huh?

22:37.792 --> 22:38.875
No. No.

22:38.959 --> 22:41.500
I'm going to go with the crab cakes
and the little quesadillas.

22:41.583 --> 22:44.709
Well, all we need is a wedding cake,
and we're done.

22:44.792 --> 22:47.291
You are the most decisive bride
I've ever met.

22:47.375 --> 22:49.000
I just guess I'm in a rush.

22:49.125 --> 22:50.250
Oh?

22:50.750 --> 22:55.709
Oh, gotcha. Well, don't worry,
you are not showing at all.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.709
Oh, no, no, no. No, I'm not pregnant.

22:57.792 --> 23:01.792
No, I just know what I want,
which is Ian.

23:01.875 --> 23:05.500
So I'm just eager to, you know,
not get it over with, per se,

23:05.583 --> 23:08.500
but just to get to the good part.

23:08.583 --> 23:11.458
Which is the marriage to Ian.

23:12.208 --> 23:16.125
He seems like a great guy.
I don't suppose he has a brother?

23:19.417 --> 23:21.291
So you're not seeing anyone?

23:21.375 --> 23:23.875
No. I'm between disappointments.

23:23.959 --> 23:26.125
Well, are you free for dinner tomorrow?

23:26.208 --> 23:29.583
Is this some lame setup?
Please say yes.

23:29.667 --> 23:34.000
Well, there's this guy coming to dinner
and he's single

23:34.083 --> 23:38.542
- and handsome and charming, and...
- You had me at "guy."

23:39.417 --> 23:41.250
So how do you know him?

23:43.500 --> 23:45.458
He's just a neighbour.

23:52.792 --> 23:55.583
- Hi, buddy, what you doing?
- Nothing.

23:58.208 --> 24:00.750
You seem a little mopey lately.
Is everything okay?

24:00.834 --> 24:04.542
Yeah. Can we go see Mrs McCluskey?

24:07.083 --> 24:08.625
You guys didn't have
to come down here.

24:08.709 --> 24:12.000
No matter what that CAT scan says,
I'm breaking out tomorrow.

24:12.083 --> 24:13.917
Well, Parker really
wanted to come visit you.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.208
I'm going to put a little water in these.

24:18.458 --> 24:21.542
Don't tell your brothers,
but you were always my favourite.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.917
I saw the man in your freezer.

24:26.625 --> 24:28.125
- Lynette!
- Yeah?

24:28.208 --> 24:30.750
Could you run down to the snack bar
and get me some green Jell-O?

24:30.834 --> 24:32.583
Sure.

24:37.208 --> 24:40.250
Okay, time for a little grown-up talk.

24:49.333 --> 24:53.417
So can you understand now
why I had to do what I did?

24:53.500 --> 24:56.291
And how you can never tell anyone,
not even your mom.

24:56.375 --> 25:01.333
Hey, they didn't have Jell-O,
so I hope pudding is okay.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.208
You know, let's give it to Parker.
A good boy like him deserves a treat.

25:17.333 --> 25:19.583
What are you thinking about?

25:19.875 --> 25:21.166
Just...

25:22.417 --> 25:24.750
This room doesn't really work.

25:25.125 --> 25:26.750
It's too sterile.

25:26.834 --> 25:30.166
Could we go back to
that Spanish colonial on Third?

25:30.250 --> 25:32.709
Sure. Fine.

25:33.417 --> 25:35.709
You know what I was thinking?

25:37.500 --> 25:39.208
I'm really happy.

25:40.125 --> 25:43.750
And I haven't felt this happy
in a long time.

25:45.333 --> 25:48.208
How about you? Are you happy?

25:49.417 --> 25:51.375
Oh, my God.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.250
Oops, sorry, bed's not made.

25:54.333 --> 25:55.500
Russell!

25:55.583 --> 25:59.500
Why don't you check out
the Sub Zero in the kitchen? It's to die.

25:59.583 --> 26:03.750
Well, I see you can't close a sale
without opening something else.

26:03.834 --> 26:08.667
Oh, please. I heard about
your open house on Holly Drive.

26:08.792 --> 26:11.083
They're still disinfecting the Jacuzzi!

26:11.625 --> 26:13.875
- Slut.
- Bitch.

26:17.250 --> 26:19.792
- You think he's gonna tell anyone?
- He's a gay realtor.

26:19.875 --> 26:23.875
- He's speed-dialling as we speak.
- Then go stop him!

26:23.959 --> 26:26.625
What's the big deal?
Who cares if people find out?

26:26.709 --> 26:28.834
- I do.
- Why?

26:29.375 --> 26:32.417
- Are you embarrassed to be dating me?
- No.

26:33.458 --> 26:36.417
If Gabby finds out
she's going to hit the ceiling.

26:36.500 --> 26:39.750
Oh, why would she care?
She's dating that Victor guy.

26:39.834 --> 26:42.291
Please, that's not gonna last.

26:46.041 --> 26:47.583
Oh, my God.

26:48.709 --> 26:50.667
You're still in love with her.

26:51.375 --> 26:53.500
No. I just...

26:53.583 --> 26:57.709
I mean, we've been getting along,
and I don't want to...

26:57.792 --> 27:01.625
I don't know who the bigger moron is,
you or me.

27:02.583 --> 27:05.250
Hey, don't be like this.

27:05.333 --> 27:09.166
- Look, we're having fun, right?
- Apparently that's all we're having.

27:09.250 --> 27:12.834
- Edie, come on.
- No. Fun's over.

27:21.458 --> 27:24.834
Mike. Thanks for coming.

27:24.917 --> 27:26.750
Thanks for asking me.

27:28.583 --> 27:30.625
Susan.

27:34.583 --> 27:36.041
Hi.

27:36.125 --> 27:39.375
Mike, I want you to meet Maggie Gilroy.

27:46.375 --> 27:49.834
I don't believe this.
You're setting me up?

27:49.917 --> 27:53.375
- You need to move on, okay?
- I don't want to move on.

27:53.458 --> 27:55.834
- I came here to see you.
- Well, I'm not available.

27:55.917 --> 27:59.750
So if you feel like kissing someone
tonight, point those lips at Maggie.

28:01.750 --> 28:05.291
Here we go. Your beer.

28:07.542 --> 28:10.291
Did I mention that Maggie
is an amazing chef?

28:10.375 --> 28:11.959
We're embarrassed
to be cooking for her.

28:12.041 --> 28:16.875
Stop. So, Mike, do you have
a favourite type of cuisine?

28:19.542 --> 28:23.208
No. After three months of prison food,
everything tastes good to me.

28:24.875 --> 28:29.250
- So you were in prison?
- He was totally innocent.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.750
Yeah, a woman was
bludgeoned to death,

28:31.834 --> 28:34.291
and her blood wound up on my wrench.

28:34.375 --> 28:35.667
Oh, my God.

28:35.750 --> 28:38.000
But he was cleared!
All charges dropped!

28:38.083 --> 28:40.208
Here. Eat this.

28:40.291 --> 28:41.542
That's just so awful.

28:41.625 --> 28:44.417
To go to jail for a crime
you didn't commit.

28:44.500 --> 28:45.875
It was just a few months.

28:45.959 --> 28:48.750
Now, my first stretch
for manslaughter...

28:48.834 --> 28:50.542
That was brutal.

28:53.834 --> 28:57.166
My worst cellmate was this guy
called Stilts.

28:57.250 --> 29:00.583
When they arrested him,
they found a bowl full of ears.

29:02.959 --> 29:06.792
- I think that was meant for you.
- Sorry.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.500
So why don't I just go
and brew some coffee?

29:09.583 --> 29:12.458
And I brought a little surprise
for dessert.

29:12.542 --> 29:16.333
- Wedding cakes for you to sample.
- Great.

29:21.417 --> 29:22.917
Thanks a lot.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.125
Now Maggie thinks
you're Charles Manson.

29:25.208 --> 29:27.125
I don't care. I love you.

29:27.208 --> 29:28.959
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

29:29.041 --> 29:30.750
I remember everything now.

29:30.834 --> 29:33.834
When I got run over,
I was on my way to propose to you.

29:33.917 --> 29:36.291
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I do.

29:37.291 --> 29:39.125
What would you have said?

29:41.333 --> 29:43.583
You know what I would have said.
It doesn't matter now.

29:43.667 --> 29:45.417
The hell it doesn't, Susan.

29:45.500 --> 29:46.792
If you can look me in the eye

29:46.875 --> 29:49.542
and tell me that when we kissed
you felt nothing,

29:49.625 --> 29:51.250
then I'll just go.

29:51.333 --> 29:54.709
But only if you can say that
and really mean it.

29:54.792 --> 29:56.125
Can you?

29:57.458 --> 29:59.458
Who wants wedding cake?

30:05.667 --> 30:08.333
- Maggie, these cakes are fantastic.
- Great.

30:08.417 --> 30:10.917
All you have to do is choose one,
and we're done.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.458
- Did you notice the themes?
- Themes?

30:13.542 --> 30:15.750
Yes. This one is very British.

30:15.834 --> 30:19.166
Fondant icing and toffee ganache.

30:19.250 --> 30:21.917
And this is your classic American.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.250
White cake with butter cream frosting.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.667
So which one do you like the best?

30:31.458 --> 30:33.834
Wow, it's kind of hard to decide.

30:33.917 --> 30:36.542
Well, that depends
on what you're looking for.

30:36.625 --> 30:38.375
Rich and elegant

30:39.625 --> 30:41.709
or down to earth and sweet?

30:46.917 --> 30:49.834
- I don't know.
- You want to taste them again?

30:49.917 --> 30:53.417
No. I know what they taste like.
I'm just torn, okay?

30:53.500 --> 30:55.834
There's no need to get upset.
It's just a cake.

30:55.917 --> 30:59.542
It's not just a cake!
It's a major decision!

30:59.625 --> 31:02.917
Hey, if you like them both so much,
why don't you have two cakes?

31:03.000 --> 31:04.125
How would that look?

31:04.208 --> 31:07.417
"Oh, hey everybody,
here's my wedding cake!

31:07.500 --> 31:10.709
"Oh, and what's that over there?
It's my other wedding cake!"

31:10.792 --> 31:13.834
I have to pick! And I will!

31:13.959 --> 31:16.583
So just stop pressuring me, okay?

31:23.709 --> 31:25.083
I'm sorry.

31:28.083 --> 31:30.917
I think I was just having
a little sugar rush.

31:34.792 --> 31:37.667
Thanks again. And sorry.

31:52.583 --> 31:55.500
Seriously, just put it off.
Just a month or two.

31:55.583 --> 31:58.291
Excuse me,
am I interrupting something?

31:58.375 --> 32:00.750
No. It's nothing.

32:01.583 --> 32:03.583
I think it's time to level with him.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.542
I just told Susan I want her back.

32:07.959 --> 32:09.041
Excuse me?

32:09.125 --> 32:11.417
Look, I know it puts
a crimp in your plans.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.917
I'm sorry. But I love her.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.375
Well, that's too damn bad, isn't it?
Because she doesn't love you.

32:16.458 --> 32:19.625
Really? She didn't seem to mind
when I kissed her.

32:19.709 --> 32:22.291
What? Did he just kiss you?

32:22.375 --> 32:24.208
No. It was days ago.

32:24.291 --> 32:27.083
- And you let him?
- No. He pounced.

32:27.166 --> 32:31.917
- It was hardly a pounce.
- You bastard! We had an agreement!

32:32.000 --> 32:33.250
Susan doesn't have to marry you

32:33.333 --> 32:36.583
because you won her
in a game of cards.

32:36.709 --> 32:40.417
What, he didn't tell you how we played
poker for you?

32:40.500 --> 32:42.834
You bet me in a game of poker?

32:43.125 --> 32:44.583
It's not how it sounds.

32:44.667 --> 32:46.667
I merely suggested
that if I won the hand

32:46.750 --> 32:48.792
then he would stop badgering you.

32:50.041 --> 32:51.583
And if he won?

32:52.667 --> 32:54.375
Well, I forget the exact terms.

32:54.458 --> 32:56.458
But the point is,
he lost, as I knew he would.

32:56.542 --> 33:00.458
I never would have wagered you
if I didn't have a very good hand.

33:02.709 --> 33:04.625
- Get out.
- Susan, please.

33:04.709 --> 33:06.291
- You heard her.
- You too!

33:06.375 --> 33:07.875
I've had it with both of you.

33:07.959 --> 33:10.500
You're tugging at me
like I'm some kind of wishbone.

33:10.583 --> 33:13.792
- You're just upset.
- No, I am beyond upset.

33:13.875 --> 33:15.875
You two want a decision?
Well, here's what I decide.

33:15.959 --> 33:19.458
There will be no kissing,
and there will be no wedding.

33:19.542 --> 33:21.917
And there will be no damn cake!

33:37.667 --> 33:41.166
- What's this?
- Pumpkin sage ravioli.

33:41.250 --> 33:44.500
It's a little thank you
for taking a chance on me.

33:44.583 --> 33:47.000
Are you kidding?
I should be thanking you.

33:47.083 --> 33:49.458
We took in three grand tonight.

33:50.333 --> 33:52.875
Oh, wow. Candles, too.

33:52.959 --> 33:57.458
Yeah, I think we should use them
all the time. It softens up the ambiance.

33:59.959 --> 34:01.667
So, come on, eat.

34:10.792 --> 34:12.291
Oh, my God.

34:12.375 --> 34:17.500
If we serve this for tomorrow's special,
we will clear four grand.

34:17.583 --> 34:21.208
Great. Just be sure to run it by Tom.

34:21.291 --> 34:24.041
Why?
You know he'll just shoot it down.

34:24.291 --> 34:27.875
I mean, I get it, he's in pain,
he doesn't like being sidelined,

34:27.959 --> 34:30.125
but that is no reason to...

34:32.166 --> 34:34.041
You know what?
Let's talk about something else.

34:34.125 --> 34:35.542
Yeah, sure.

34:36.750 --> 34:39.458
I mean, unless you'd like to go?
You're here so late all the time.

34:39.542 --> 34:41.375
No. No, I like being here.

34:41.458 --> 34:43.917
It beats going home
to an empty apartment.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.250
Don't you have any friends
to hang out with?

34:45.333 --> 34:47.041
My friends come in two varieties.

34:47.125 --> 34:49.083
The ones I drove away
before I got clean,

34:49.166 --> 34:52.625
and the ones I should avoid
if I want to stay clean.

34:52.875 --> 34:55.291
Yeah, I gotcha.

35:00.917 --> 35:04.667
- You ever wear your hair down?
- What? Yeah.

35:04.750 --> 35:07.000
Sometimes. Why?

35:07.375 --> 35:09.083
It looks really good.

35:10.583 --> 35:12.834
You should do it more often.

35:13.375 --> 35:16.166
Oh, well, thanks.

35:26.834 --> 35:29.000
This is delicious.

35:29.375 --> 35:32.417
Thanks. Do you want some more wine?

35:32.500 --> 35:33.667
Sure.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.208
Daddy!

35:44.083 --> 35:46.417
The paper has a story
about your restaurant!

35:46.500 --> 35:50.750
You're kidding! Come here.
What does it say?

35:52.542 --> 35:55.083
"When Scavo's Pizzeria
opened its doors,

35:55.166 --> 35:57.583
"you could almost hear the city groan,

35:57.667 --> 36:00.542
"'Just what we need,
another pizza joint.'

36:00.625 --> 36:04.458
"But with an updated menu
from new chef Rick Coletti..."

36:04.542 --> 36:06.834
Is he the man who cooked us
that really, really...

36:06.917 --> 36:09.834
Yeah. Yep, that's the one.
What else does it say, honey?

36:09.917 --> 36:14.166
"There's more than just crayons on the
table. The veal piccata is divine,

36:14.250 --> 36:19.291
"and the mushroom risotto
is an..." E-X-Q-U...

36:19.375 --> 36:21.875
- Exquisite.
-"...an exquisite treat.

36:22.250 --> 36:25.750
"Scavo's has been transformed
from a mundane family eatery

36:25.834 --> 36:28.083
"into the area's hottest..."

36:28.667 --> 36:30.542
That's enough, Kayla.

36:33.375 --> 36:34.917
Daddy's tired.

36:35.583 --> 36:36.750
Okay.

36:55.291 --> 36:58.792
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
I know you guys like a good scandal.

36:58.875 --> 37:03.166
But I think the citizens of Fairview
are more interested in the real issues.

37:08.041 --> 37:12.417
Mr Lang, given your 15-point drop
in the polls,

37:12.500 --> 37:14.542
what do you have to say
to your constituents?

37:14.625 --> 37:19.458
Well, I would ask them to not base
their view of me on a single...

37:19.542 --> 37:23.208
- It's not going very well, is it?
- Picked up on that, did you?

37:24.667 --> 37:26.583
Who is she, Mr Lang? Give us a name.

37:26.667 --> 37:28.542
No, I will not identify the woman.

37:28.667 --> 37:31.417
What are you hiding?
Is she a prostitute?

37:31.500 --> 37:36.291
No, she's not a prostitute.
I'll answer your questions one at a time.

37:37.583 --> 37:38.667
Hey. Hey.

37:42.709 --> 37:44.458
That does it.

37:44.542 --> 37:47.208
Wait, what are you doing?
Gabby, stop, please.

37:47.291 --> 37:51.000
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me!
- Could you please...

37:53.250 --> 37:56.875
Excuse me!
I am the woman in the photos.

37:56.959 --> 37:58.625
May I have your name?

38:05.125 --> 38:08.125
- What are you doing?
- Standing by my man.

38:12.375 --> 38:14.792
My name is Gabrielle Marquez,

38:14.875 --> 38:18.000
and I want you to know right before
those photos were taken,

38:18.083 --> 38:19.917
Victor asked me to marry him.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.709
What did you say?

38:25.625 --> 38:29.583
I said, "Yes, I would be thrilled to be
Mrs Victor Lang."

38:29.709 --> 38:31.959
What are your family values?

38:32.041 --> 38:35.834
- Mr Lang, are you gonna get married?
- Have you set a date?

38:37.291 --> 38:40.583
In fact, I was so overcome that
when we were trapped in the elevator,

38:40.667 --> 38:45.125
I seized the moment
to...express my joy.

38:45.208 --> 38:47.667
So this is a love story?

38:47.750 --> 38:51.750
The only reason Victor kept it
from you was to protect me,

38:51.875 --> 38:56.291
because he's the kind of man who puts
a woman's honour before his own.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.917
And that's the kind of man you marry.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.625
That's the kind of man you vote for.

39:25.750 --> 39:27.500
What's that smell?

39:45.625 --> 39:46.834
Ma'am.

39:50.583 --> 39:52.625
Are you Karen McCluskey?

39:53.458 --> 39:56.375
That little bastard gave me up,
didn't he?

39:57.333 --> 40:00.125
<i>Today, at the mayoral candidate's</i>
<i>press conference,</i>

40:00.208 --> 40:04.834

<i>In a few months,</i>
<i>I will be Mrs Victor Lang.</i>

40:38.625 --> 40:39.917

the power company
is still having problems,

40:42.083 --> 40:44.792
and there might be
another rolling blackout today.

40:44.875 --> 40:47.500
Do you want me to leave Ida's number,
in case something happens?

40:47.583 --> 40:49.500
I'm sure I'll be fine.

40:50.375 --> 40:52.834
Did you read our review in the paper?

40:53.542 --> 40:54.667
Yep.

40:57.375 --> 41:01.083
Okay. I'm off.

41:24.250 --> 41:25.750

41:25.834 --> 41:29.208

41:55.000 --> 41:58.750
