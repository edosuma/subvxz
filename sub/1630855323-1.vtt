00:47.173 --> 00:48.424

of yours.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.259

they are raving.

Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson,

00:53.721 --> 00:55.723

his comedy sidekick again.

when you are friends,

01:10.780 --> 01:12.114

01:12.198 --> 01:14.074

as-as heroes as well.

I'm not gonna dance.

Next time then, for sure.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.581

02:02.665 --> 02:05.793
Like, okay, when you--
when you see Idris Elba, right,

02:05.876 --> 02:07.920
you see him and you go,
"Wow, that's an action star".

02:08.003 --> 02:10.631
But if you took
six inches off of Idris,

02:10.714 --> 02:12.174
nobody--
nobody's gonna give a shit.

02:12.258 --> 02:13.676
- Okay-okay, just--
- Okay.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.845
- Gentle reminder here,
it's a live broadcast.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.346
- Got it.
But you get my point.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.722
Nobody's gonna care.
- Right.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.015
- All right,
if he was smaller.

02:20.099 --> 02:21.600
I mean, I don't think
I know any action stars

02:21.684 --> 02:24.103

Can we name one?

02:24.186 --> 02:27.022

Oh, there's Mr. Tom Cruise.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.274
- Oh, wonderful.

02:28.357 --> 02:29.900

A favorite here on the show.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.485

That's one. All right.

02:31.569 --> 02:32.903

Getting back to the movie,

just how great this movie is.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.976

"Oh, hell no"?

Why can't I be an action star?

09:06.922 --> 09:09.716
Hello?

09:09.800 --> 09:13.637
Anybody here?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.889
Claude Van De Velde,
he sent me.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.516
- I don't know, you tell me
what you wanna tell me.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.060
Why are you here?
Why are you here?

09:20.143 --> 09:22.396
- Where's my nephew at?
- Uh, fellas?

09:22.479 --> 09:23.563
- What do you mean
where's your nephew?

09:23.647 --> 09:25.065
I don't know where the fuck
your nephew is.

09:25.148 --> 09:30.112
- Hey, excuse me?
- Now you don't trust me?

09:30.195 --> 09:32.030
- I know you murdered
my nephew, Rodrigo.

09:32.114 --> 09:35.075
- Bullshit, motherfucker!
I didn't murder Rodrigo.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.494
Look, you got your money.
I got my shipment.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.538
I don't know
where Rodrigo is.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.081
Maybe he's fucking
your mother.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.541
- Oh, training
has already begun.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.252
Okay. Uh...

09:45.335 --> 09:47.546
- You. You. Oh, come on!
Bring it! Bring it!

09:47.629 --> 09:49.589
Come on, bring that bat,
motherfucker!

09:49.673 --> 09:51.717
- Hey!

09:51.800 --> 09:54.386
You wanna
push somebody around?

09:54.469 --> 09:57.431
Try me out.

09:57.514 --> 10:01.059
- Hey, and what are you,
a tough guy?

10:01.143 --> 10:02.853
- Goddamn right,
I'm a tough guy.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.688
North Philadelphia tough.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.857
I'm Kevin motherfucking--

10:11.778 --> 10:15.866
Ah!

10:15.949 --> 10:17.326
What the hell happened?

10:17.409 --> 10:19.828
- Welcome to Ron Wilcox
Action Star School.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.246
I'm Ron Wilcox,

10:21.330 --> 10:22.622
and that was
your first lesson.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.124
- Gettin' hit in the head
with a bat?

10:24.207 --> 10:27.252
- Oh, you are naive.
That was a prop bat.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.421
It that was made of plastic.
- Wasn't goddamn plastic.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.589
I've been hit
with a bat before,

10:30.672 --> 10:31.840
I know what a metal bat
fuckin' feel like.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.258
- All right.

10:33.342 --> 10:35.761
Hey, Mr. Van De Velde
told me to tell him

10:35.844 --> 10:38.013
if you complain about
anything being too difficult.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.514
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.

10:39.598 --> 10:40.557
I'm not complaining.
- Mm-hmm.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.516
- I'm not complaining
about nothing.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.851
I loved that.

10:42.934 --> 10:43.769
I thought it was great,
to be honest with you,

10:43.852 --> 10:45.103
it gave me a rush.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.980
- Good.
Let's take the tour.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.899
- Yeah.
- Come on.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.984
This place is to be
a slaughterhouse

10:51.068 --> 10:52.069
up till the '70s.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.779
And then,
as legend has it,

10:53.862 --> 10:56.615
the animals revolted
against their tormentors

10:56.698 --> 10:58.033
and they slaughtered
the humans.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.576
- Oh, my God.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.037
- And my pal, Charles Norris,
you know him as Chuck,

11:02.120 --> 11:04.081
well, he needed a place
to train.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.041
I bought it.
I mentored him.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.543
And that's why he's the badass
that he is today.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.587
- Hmm...

11:10.670 --> 11:16.426
- Yeah, he nearly died
within these walls.

11:16.510 --> 11:20.639
And that's how Ron Wilcox
Action Star School got born.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.308
- Ron Wilcox A.S.S.,
for short.

11:23.392 --> 11:24.976
- What the fuck
did you just say to me?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.442
- Did Matt Da--
Matt Damon, go here?

11:32.526 --> 11:36.738
- Oh, Matty boy!
Fuck yeah, Matt Damon!

11:36.822 --> 11:38.740
Before he came to me,
he was a no name actor

11:38.824 --> 11:40.951
from New England.
He was nothing.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.329
He was a hundred pounds
soakin' wet.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.747
- You sure we're talking about
the same Matt Damon?

11:45.831 --> 11:47.499
- Hell yeah.
Matt Damon!

11:47.582 --> 11:50.210
- Huh. Okay. Yeah--

11:50.293 --> 11:53.880
- Un-unh. Rule number one,
no phones 'til you graduate.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.173
- Okay.
I run an empire,

11:55.257 --> 11:56.299
so unfortunately,
I need my--

11:56.383 --> 11:57.592
- Okay, fine,
you know what I'll do?

11:57.676 --> 11:58.718
I'll just call
Mr. Van De Velde,

11:58.802 --> 12:00.679
and I tell him,
"Oh, the phone policy

12:00.762 --> 12:03.723
"wasn't working for him.
It wasn't to his liking."

12:03.807 --> 12:05.725
I know what
you're gonna do with this.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.310
You're going to make calls
to Hollywood.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.062
You're gonna say,
"Hello, Hollywood.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.647
"Ron's school
is too tough for me.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.315
"I need more drugs."
- No.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.359
- Yeah, you're gonna say,
"Oh, I'm Kevin Hart.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.653
"I need more caviar
and champagne."

12:16.736 --> 12:19.156
- I just wanna talk
to my employees.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.366
- That's fine,
but I'm still keeping it.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.201
- Okay.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.290
- Okay, until you graduate,

12:28.373 --> 12:30.709
you are forbidden from
visiting the outside world.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.044
You'll stay here.
- Say what?

12:33.128 --> 12:35.130
- You got your bed,
you got your toilet,

12:35.213 --> 12:38.884
you got your sink.
All the modern amenities.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.558
- Okay.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.102
It's supposed
to toughen me up.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.354
Okay, I get it.

12:51.438 --> 12:55.025
Yeah, I'm good with that.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.819
Yeah, might be a little
too good with it.

12:57.903 --> 13:01.865
- And rule number two,
No fucking on the premises.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.493
No anal, no blowjobs,
no nothin'.

13:06.703 --> 13:10.248
- Who else is here?

13:10.332 --> 13:12.167
- Just me.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.007
Twenty minutes
'til lights out.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.514
- So those--

13:25.597 --> 13:27.140
those two Colombian guys
that hit me in the head

13:27.224 --> 13:29.017
with the prop bat,
they were actors, right?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.520
- Yeah, exactly.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.022
Okay, rule number three,

13:34.105 --> 13:36.900
When you're under this roof,
your name is no longer Kevin,

13:36.983 --> 13:39.361
it's Agent Hart,
and you'll refer to me

13:39.444 --> 13:43.365
as Ron Wilcox, or Ron,
or Wilcox, or Coach Ron.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.491
- I like Coach Ron.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.243
- And I refer to you as...
- Agent Hart.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.285
- Right.
- Right.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.453
- Yes.
- See, I'm on it.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.830
Now I assume you got me in
this FBI jacket

13:50.914 --> 13:52.874
and stuff for a reason.
So, what is it?

13:52.958 --> 13:54.709
- Hey, would you do me
a favor?

13:54.793 --> 13:55.961
- Yeah.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.505
- Kevin, would you
grab that chair for me?

13:58.588 --> 13:59.506
- Yeah.
- Would you?

13:59.589 --> 14:01.424
- You mean this one?
- No, goddammit!

14:01.508 --> 14:03.843
I said respond
only to Agent Hart!

14:03.927 --> 14:08.265
- Fuck!

14:08.348 --> 14:10.433
You just said that.
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.643
That's not gonna
happen again.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.019
Why don't you just
call me Kevin?

14:13.103 --> 14:14.980
- Okay, in your life,
have you ever heard

14:15.063 --> 14:19.859
an action star leading man
ever called Kevin?

14:19.943 --> 14:21.319
- I mean, Kevin James
in "Mall Cop".

14:21.403 --> 14:23.863
- No, no. Kevin is the name
of a punk bitch.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.700
Ethan Hunt,
that is an action star name.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.702
Tom Cruise was my alumni.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.620
For nine years of his life,

14:30.704 --> 14:33.331
he only responded
to Ethan Hunt

14:33.415 --> 14:35.834
whether he was
on-camera or off-camera.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.211
Whether he was in the shower,
or on the toilet.

14:38.295 --> 14:39.921
Whether he was fucking,
or not fucking.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.256
- Okay, I--
- If he was even--

14:41.339 --> 14:45.135
- I understand, Coach Ron!
- Do you? Do you really?

14:45.218 --> 14:48.471
I hope so, for your sake.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.266
Because your life
depends on it.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.852
Okay, next lesson.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.812
Every leading man
needs to know

14:55.895 --> 14:57.606
how to run into
a burning building

14:57.689 --> 14:59.024
and save a stranger.
- Hmm.

15:04.362 --> 15:05.905
- Wow!

15:05.989 --> 15:08.033
Holy shit.
How'd you do that, man?

15:08.116 --> 15:10.702
- And the stranger that
we are going to save today

15:10.785 --> 15:15.415
is our own action star dummy,
little Kevin.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.794
- That's supposed to be me?
- I don't see the resemblance.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.046
- Are you fucking kidding?

15:21.129 --> 15:24.049
- No, w-we've had this dummy
for years, buddy.

15:24.132 --> 15:27.010
- Oh, hell, no.
- Bitch, that's my line.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.678
I've said that line in,
like, twelve movies.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.305
- Agent Hart,
are you a narcissist?

15:30.388 --> 15:31.723
- No.

15:31.806 --> 15:32.974
- Do you think the whole world
is all about you?

15:33.058 --> 15:34.601
- That's not-- I'm not--
- No.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.645
You look at you
and then you look at him.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.605
- That's what--
- Look at you, and look at him.

15:38.688 --> 15:42.067
Do you see any resemblance?
- Kind of sort of, man!

15:42.150 --> 15:45.236
O-Okay, all right.
Okay, maybe I'm crazy.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.238
- Help!
Help me!

15:47.322 --> 15:50.659
Oh, hell no!
Help! Help me!

15:50.742 --> 15:52.285
Oh, hell no!

15:52.369 --> 15:54.996
- Now, safety during stunts
is of the utmost importance.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.623
- Yeah, but I mean,
that's why you got stuntmen,

15:56.706 --> 15:59.751
right?
- Watch it.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.378
- No, for the other guys,
not for me.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.588
T-the lightweights.
I don't--

16:03.672 --> 16:06.549
- Okay, your jacket
is flame retardant,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.551
which means that
if you catch on fire,

16:08.635 --> 16:11.596
don't panic, I will come in
and put you out.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.140
- Okay.
Y-You're gonna--

16:14.224 --> 16:15.850
Okay, I feel-I feel good--
I feel good about that.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.728
- When you're ready,
I want you to storm the house,

16:18.812 --> 16:21.481
find the victim,
and bring him to safety.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.777
- What is that?

16:25.860 --> 16:27.404
What are you doing?
I do--

16:27.487 --> 16:30.073
- Psyching myself up.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.998
It's hot!
Hot!

16:51.469 --> 16:53.304
It's fucking hot!

16:53.388 --> 16:56.182
Where the fuck are you at?
Oh, God.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.018
Oh, fuck, I can't see shit!

16:59.102 --> 17:01.229
Little Kev?

17:01.312 --> 17:04.149
- Excuse me,
are you Ron Wilcox?

17:04.232 --> 17:06.276
- Oh, hello.
How are you?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.570
- Jordan King.
- We've been waiting for you.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.780
- Help! Help me!

17:10.864 --> 17:12.657
- I've got you, little Kev.
- Oh, hell no!

17:12.741 --> 17:14.784
- I'm about to save
your little beautiful black ass.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.537
- Help! Help me!

17:17.620 --> 17:19.205
Oh, hell no!

17:19.289 --> 17:20.457
- What the fuck?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.333
Who is this?
- Help! Help me!

17:22.417 --> 17:24.961
Oh, hell no!
- What the--

17:25.044 --> 17:28.381
- Help! Help me!
Oh, hell no!

17:28.465 --> 17:30.175
- It's fucking hot!

17:30.258 --> 17:31.468
Get your ass up.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.970
- Yeah, um,
I'm just so nervous.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.347
I've never been in
an action movie before.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.974
I just wanna bring
my A-game here.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.143
- 90% is mental, okay?
- Oh, shit-- Oh, shit!

17:40.226 --> 17:42.812
- You are gonna be fantastic.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.356
I just know it.
- Oh, shit.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.525
Is he okay?
- Oh, God.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.652
You leave this guy alone
for five seconds.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.987
Geez.
- Put me out! Put me out!

17:51.070 --> 17:53.615
Put me out! Put me out!
Put me out!

17:56.910 --> 17:58.995
- Is he okay?
- Oh, he's fine.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.663
Gal Gadot was training with me,

18:00.747 --> 18:02.499
she was on fire
for twelve minutes.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.709
She put herself out
with a blanket.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.337
He barely lasted
twelve seconds.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.088
- Is this funny to you?

18:09.172 --> 18:12.217
- Hey, a leading man must learn
not to sweat the small stuff.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.052
- What are you talking about
the small stuff?

18:14.135 --> 18:15.970
I was on fucking fire,
Coach Ron!

18:16.054 --> 18:17.472
- Hey, knock it off!

18:17.555 --> 18:19.849
There's a lady present,
and I want you to meet her.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.101
Agent Hart,
this is Agent Jordan King.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.228
She'll be your bunkmate.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.854
- It is a pleasure
to meet you.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.439
My pleasure.
Okay, you wanna explain to me

18:26.523 --> 18:28.316
why she get
this nice introduction?

18:28.399 --> 18:30.109
Why isn't she getting
hit in the head with a bat?

I just zone him out.

Come on, I'll give you a tour.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.912

intercourse on the premises.

18:53.842 --> 18:58.137

that won't be a problem.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.851

I-It's fine, we're good.

You're the best.

Do you really wanna know
how I mean?

Because I was here
a couple days ago

19:29.252 --> 19:30.587
and shit hit the fan.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.005
There was a guy in here
accusing him

19:32.088 --> 19:34.299
of murdering some dude
named Rodrigo.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.134
- Rodrigo?
- Yes, Rodrigo.

Saw a whole thing.

And when I first
walked in this bitch,

19:38.595 --> 19:40.221
they hit me in the head
with a bat.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.807
Not no plastic bat.
With a fucking metal bat!

And today, today he let me
catch myself on fire!

19:45.560 --> 19:48.104

myself on fire"?

you gotta sound it out.

19:49.439 --> 19:52.650
Yes. Let me catch--
no, I see why you did that.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.110
Because if you slow it down,

it don't sound right.

But you get what I'm saying.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.823
It happened.
It fucking happened.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.074
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

20:00.158 --> 20:01.701
It's just,
I don't have my phone,

20:01.784 --> 20:03.661
it's weird in here,

20:03.745 --> 20:04.871

fuck with me.

Maybe-maybe I'm going
a little stir crazy.

not alone anymore, so...

Hey, do I know you?

20:25.767 --> 20:28.978
- Oh.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.940
- I do!
Fuck!

20:32.023 --> 20:34.233
You're the girl from
that sitcom with the robot.

20:34.317 --> 20:35.526
The robot that was
a butler, right?

20:35.610 --> 20:36.653
You used to argue
with the butler,

20:36.736 --> 20:38.696
"Uh-uh,
get the fuck out of here".

20:38.780 --> 20:40.823
You'd do the thing,
"Butler, bitch".

Yeah, yeah.

- Well, was.
I just quit.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.708
Kathryn Bigelow offered me
the lead in her next movie,

20:50.792 --> 20:53.586
which is huge, since there are,
like, what,

20:53.670 --> 20:56.130
three total action roles
for women?

20:56.214 --> 20:57.799
- Oh, it's a lot
more than that.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.760
But congrats.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.972
Are you-- I mean,
you want me to name 'em?

21:04.055 --> 21:06.057
I can go down the list.
You got Wonder Woman, right?

21:06.140 --> 21:07.600
You know, the Black Widow.

21:07.684 --> 21:12.522
You got, um, what was the one
with the woman with the, uh--

21:12.605 --> 21:16.651
she's, uh-- what's--
that's three.

21:16.734 --> 21:20.989
- Anyway, um, it's all riding on
this action school.

21:21.072 --> 21:23.157
I've just gotta prove to Ron
that I've got the chops,

21:23.241 --> 21:24.409
that I'm fit enough.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.327
- You ain't gotta
prove that to nobody.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.496
You are fit.

21:28.579 --> 21:32.166
When you walked in that door
I said, "God damn."

21:32.250 --> 21:34.127
Not like that.

21:34.210 --> 21:37.046
I'm not saying it like that.
I don't mean it that way.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.464

- Yeah.

21:38.548 --> 21:41.551

So, just to be clear.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.886
- We're-we're here for
the same thing, right?

21:43.970 --> 21:45.054
Fuck friendship.
- Good.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.932
- Yeah.

we're going to focus

22:04.282 --> 22:07.827

motivations.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.204
Agent King,
what is your motivation?

22:10.288 --> 22:11.956
- After working undercover
in Paris,

22:12.040 --> 22:13.833
I go down to the basement
of the Louvre,

22:13.916 --> 22:16.794
where I thwart the theft of
an ancient Egyptian artifact

22:16.878 --> 22:19.047
when I'm accosted by
a rogue agent.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.507
- Good, Agent Hart.
- Accost?

22:21.591 --> 22:22.592
That's a little strong,
isn't it?

22:22.675 --> 22:26.763
- What the fuck?
Focus. Focus.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.557

I-I'm an agent.

go get Agent King.

And just a question,
is this, like,

22:43.488 --> 22:46.365
some James Bond fan fiction?
- And, action.

22:54.582 --> 22:57.251
- Agent King?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.303

in the business

28:41.387 --> 28:43.013
training action stars,

28:43.097 --> 28:45.516
every stunt scene was practical,

28:45.599 --> 28:48.686

retractable.

That's great.

an action star

28:54.483 --> 28:56.902

15 movies

were you the leading man?

29:05.453 --> 29:07.371

on a green screen

29:07.455 --> 29:10.249
and pretend to be eaten by
a CG dragon.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.168
Hell, even little Kevin
can do that.

to dress him like me?

29:16.380 --> 29:17.548
It's really--

29:17.631 --> 29:19.467

what does a leading woman,

29:19.550 --> 29:22.344
or leading man,
get to do onscreen

29:22.428 --> 29:24.638

- Win fights.

29:24.722 --> 29:27.850

- Make love.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.478
Today's lesson

will take place.

44:16.988 --> 44:18.573

a gun like that.

44:22.243 --> 44:23.370
It's always from the back.

44:23.453 --> 44:24.746

44:24.829 --> 44:26.915

You failed.

44:26.998 --> 44:30.126
Now, these firearms
are loaded, okay?

44:30.210 --> 44:33.838
So please, be careful
how you handle them.

44:33.922 --> 44:35.048
- Well, we don't have
to be that careful

44:35.131 --> 44:36.883

blanks in them, right?

44:36.966 --> 44:38.093
Not loaded, loaded.
Just--

44:38.176 --> 44:40.011
They're blanks, correct?

44:41.554 --> 44:44.057
No, Coach Ron, that's
not gonna do it for me.

44:44.140 --> 44:47.018

that it's blanks in this gun.

44:47.102 --> 44:48.311
- What do you think?
- Yes or no?

44:48.395 --> 44:49.646

in this gun?

44:49.729 --> 44:51.898
- Come on, Kevin.
Get your head in the game, man.

44:51.981 --> 44:53.733
- Josh, my head's in the game.
I'm just trying to be safe.

44:53.817 --> 44:56.528
And he still didn't
say yes or no.

44:56.611 --> 44:58.071
- Yes.

44:58.154 --> 45:00.657
- Yes, you heard him.
- Okay, everyone in wardrobe.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.075

right back here,

45:02.158 --> 45:03.284

45:12.293 --> 45:13.503

being paranoid.

45:13.586 --> 45:15.046
We all heard him say
there were blanks.

45:15.130 --> 45:17.590
- My gun has blanks,
I guarantee you that.

45:17.674 --> 45:20.510
But I bet you Josh, he's got
a fully loaded fuckin' pistol.

45:20.593 --> 45:22.262
Now, Ron already tried
to kill me once.

45:22.345 --> 45:24.472
Right now, he's probably willing
to go all the fuckin' way.

of those things.

This whole "Deliverance" thing
that we got goin' on right now--

50:03.835 --> 50:06.087
which is great, okay?
'Cause it's workin'.

50:06.170 --> 50:07.338
So, when things are workin',
you give 'em the accolades

50:07.422 --> 50:08.297
that they deserve.

50:08.381 --> 50:10.758
I'm-I'm uncomfortable, sir.

50:10.842 --> 50:12.802
I'm actually scared,
all right?

50:12.885 --> 50:15.179
So, now that we know that,
let me help this mood

50:15.263 --> 50:16.305
by just telling you
why I'm here.

50:16.389 --> 50:18.391
I'm tryin' to use a phone.
You got a phone?

50:18.474 --> 50:21.561
I wanna use it real quick,
and I'm outta here.

50:25.398 --> 50:26.649
- Two minutes.

50:26.733 --> 50:28.109
- No! I'm not out
of my mind.

50:28.192 --> 50:30.361
As a matter of fact,
I'm very much in my mind.

50:30.445 --> 50:32.572
The dude's tryin' to kill me.
- That's unfortunate.

50:32.655 --> 50:34.490
- What do you mean?
Unfortunate?

50:34.574 --> 50:37.243
Listen to me, Danny.
He's trying to kill me.

50:37.326 --> 50:38.453
- No, totally.

50:38.536 --> 50:40.663
Kev, listen.
I've got huge news.

50:40.747 --> 50:41.914
All right? Ready?

50:41.998 --> 50:43.833
"Pound Pups 4."

50:43.916 --> 50:48.463
"Pound Pups 4."
They want you to voice Reggie,

50:48.546 --> 50:51.132
a quick-witted,
short-tempered goldendoodle

50:51.215 --> 50:52.800
who craves mischief.

50:52.884 --> 50:54.093
- Did they ask
for me directly?

50:54.177 --> 50:55.386
- Yeah. Now, listen.

50:55.470 --> 50:57.722
The money's not what
you're used to making,

50:57.805 --> 50:59.640
but this could be the role
that gets you back

50:59.724 --> 51:03.186
in the good graces
with the comedy gods.

51:04.353 --> 51:07.398
- Hey, I-- Uh...

51:07.482 --> 51:10.485
Hey! I-- Hi.

51:10.568 --> 51:12.695
Hey, I'm Reggie
the goldendoodle

51:12.779 --> 51:14.822
and I'm ready to
create some mischief!

51:14.906 --> 51:16.699
- See? You're a genius!

51:16.783 --> 51:18.659
It's amazing.
I'm in the movie right now.

51:18.743 --> 51:19.911
I'm watchin' the movie!

51:21.412 --> 51:24.499
Now, normally, we'd,
you know, counter.

51:24.582 --> 51:26.584
Negotiate a better deal,
blah, blah, blah.

51:26.667 --> 51:28.377
I think we should
close this one.

51:28.461 --> 51:29.962
Huh? What do you think?

51:30.046 --> 51:31.714
No, no, no.
Don't sigh.

51:31.798 --> 51:33.508
Be happy.
This is good, Kev.

51:40.181 --> 51:42.892
Oh, goddamn it.
Are you crying?

51:42.975 --> 51:46.354
- How did we get here,
Danny? Hmm?

51:46.437 --> 51:48.314
How did we get here?

51:48.397 --> 51:49.774
Just tell me
how we got here.

51:49.857 --> 51:52.151
- Look. Stop beatin'
yourself up.

51:52.235 --> 51:54.529
Huh? You made a mistake.

51:54.612 --> 51:55.905
You tried to be
somethin' you're not.

51:55.988 --> 51:57.281
You're not an action hero.

51:57.365 --> 51:59.450
You know that now.

51:59.534 --> 52:00.827
So, is that a yes
on "Pound Pups 4?"

52:00.910 --> 52:02.203
- I...

52:02.286 --> 52:04.580
- Help! Help me!

52:04.664 --> 52:06.791
I'm stuck!
- Kevin?

52:06.874 --> 52:09.627
Kevin, I need
a verbal yes on this.

52:09.710 --> 52:12.046
Kevin, don't let
this go away, buddy.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.215
- Help me!
- Kev, goldendoodles.

52:14.298 --> 52:15.675
You love dogs, Kevin.

52:15.758 --> 52:16.884
- Help!

52:16.968 --> 52:18.970
- Kevin.
- Help me!

52:19.053 --> 52:20.721
Help!

52:20.805 --> 52:22.390
- Hey, you okay?
- No!

52:22.473 --> 52:25.184
- Fuck.
- Damn truck broke.

52:25.268 --> 52:27.562
- Ugh. Shit!

52:27.645 --> 52:29.355
- It's on my chest.

52:29.438 --> 52:31.065
I can't breathe.

52:31.148 --> 52:32.692
- I'm gonna call
somebody right now, man.

52:32.775 --> 52:35.653
Okay? I'm gonna
call someone.

52:35.736 --> 52:37.238
Hey.

52:37.321 --> 52:38.656
Hey!

52:38.739 --> 52:42.368
Oh, sh--

52:42.451 --> 52:44.120
Okay. Come on.

52:44.203 --> 52:45.913
You gotta lift this truck.

52:45.997 --> 52:48.499
You gotta lift this truck!

52:48.583 --> 52:50.334
Lift the fuckin' truck.

52:50.418 --> 52:52.295
Come on, Kevin.

52:52.378 --> 52:53.254
Ready.

52:53.337 --> 52:55.798
Three, two, one.

52:58.509 --> 53:02.597
I'm doing it!
I'm doin' it!

53:09.437 --> 53:11.564
Oh.

53:11.647 --> 53:12.732
You okay?

53:12.815 --> 53:15.026
Breathe, man.

53:15.109 --> 53:16.569
Slow down.

53:16.652 --> 53:19.113
Take your time.
All right.

53:19.196 --> 53:20.489
Nice and slow.
Get your breath back.

53:20.573 --> 53:22.617
- Oh, my god.
You just saved my life.

53:22.700 --> 53:25.328
- No.
- Oh, oh, yeah.

53:25.411 --> 53:27.330
You're like
a real-life Rambo.

53:32.501 --> 53:34.128
- I guess I kinda am.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.129
- Oh...

53:37.673 --> 53:40.343
How can I ever
repay you, sir?

53:40.426 --> 53:43.137
- Sir? No, man.

53:43.220 --> 53:44.931
Wait, you don't
know who I am?

53:45.014 --> 53:47.767
You don't recognize me from
movies, TV, stand-up comedy?

53:47.850 --> 53:50.144

it'll take you right to it.

Maybe take five.

We have some beef jerky.

Give me a hug.

57:12.346 --> 57:14.098

57:14.181 --> 57:16.058
- How? How does
anybody love anybody?

57:17.268 --> 57:19.603
- What?
- That's profound.

57:19.687 --> 57:22.189
- It's a good question.

57:22.273 --> 57:23.691
- We're gonna
miss you, big guy.

57:23.774 --> 57:25.442
- I'll miss you too, baby.
- That was a hoot!

57:25.526 --> 57:29.697
- Now he's lettin' us see
daytime as if we're free.

57:29.780 --> 57:32.324
- I never said you
weren't allowed to leave.

57:32.408 --> 57:34.702
You got a little bit
of imagination there, buddy.

57:34.785 --> 57:36.495
- Well, I remember
my car used to be here

57:36.579 --> 57:39.582
and now my car is
at the bottom of a ravine.

57:39.665 --> 57:41.083
Guess I'm imaginin'
that, too?

57:41.167 --> 57:43.335
- Yeah, well, you know,
this is meth country.

57:43.419 --> 57:46.839
Probably a couple of tweakers
goin' for a joyride.

57:46.922 --> 57:47.965
They'll be back.
- Ah...

57:48.048 --> 57:49.800
Tweakers love to drive,
I keep forgettin.

57:49.884 --> 57:50.759
- I thought we were
gonna be cool, baby.

57:50.843 --> 57:52.261
- Yeah.
- I am cool. Cool.

57:53.554 --> 57:54.847
- Hey, look.

57:54.930 --> 57:56.599
I know this has
been tough on you.

57:56.682 --> 57:58.684
You only got
a couple days left.

57:58.767 --> 58:01.729
My advice, take as much wisdom
as you can from this guy.

58:01.812 --> 58:03.314
And just have some fun.
- Yeah. Thank you.

58:03.397 --> 58:05.691
Appreciate you, Josh.

58:05.774 --> 58:07.651
- See ya, Kev.

58:07.735 --> 58:10.321
- I love you, man.
- I love you too, man.

58:10.404 --> 58:11.739
- Jordan.

58:14.909 --> 58:16.035
- The fuck was that?

58:25.002 --> 58:27.671
- Agent Hart.
I wanna tell ya somethin'.

58:27.755 --> 58:29.506
- I don't really feel like
dealin' with it, Coach Ron.

58:29.590 --> 58:31.634
- But look.

58:31.717 --> 58:34.053
I'm sorry about
that live bullet, man.

58:34.136 --> 58:35.763
I really am.

58:35.846 --> 58:38.390
- It's all I wanted, man.

58:38.474 --> 58:40.059
All I wanted
was an apology.

58:40.142 --> 58:42.061
- I know.

58:42.144 --> 58:45.606
You sayin' that to me makes
the world of difference.

58:45.689 --> 58:48.275
I'm sorry that
I accused you of--

58:48.359 --> 58:51.528
of tryin' to kill me
and other people.

58:51.612 --> 58:54.114
Now, give me a hug, man.
Thank you.

58:54.198 --> 58:56.116
Thank you.
- Uh, guys?

58:56.200 --> 58:58.452
- Yeah.
- Who is that?

59:13.926 --> 59:15.928
- Holy shit.
- Oh shit!

59:19.640 --> 59:22.810
- Oh, shit!

59:22.893 --> 59:24.103
- Get inside!
- What the fuck was that?

59:24.186 --> 59:26.105
- Come on!
- Fuck this shit!

59:26.188 --> 59:28.148
- Goddamn it!
- Oh, shit!

59:29.650 --> 59:33.195
- It's a bomb!

59:36.240 --> 59:38.325
- What the hell is happening?

59:38.409 --> 59:40.119
- Hey, Ron, I-I don't
know this scene.

59:40.202 --> 59:41.120
Where is it
in the script?

59:41.203 --> 59:43.414
- It is not in
the fucking script!

59:43.497 --> 59:44.790
- No, no, no.
Tell me you're kidding.

59:44.873 --> 59:46.417
Tell me that
was just a stunt.

59:46.500 --> 59:48.043
That we did not just watch
Josh Hartnett explode!

59:48.127 --> 59:51.297
- It is not a stunt!
It is not in the script!

59:51.380 --> 59:53.549
Josh Hartnett is dead!

59:53.632 --> 59:57.136
Oh, god, I've fucked up.
I've fucked up!

59:57.219 --> 59:58.512
- What the fuck is goin' on?

59:58.595 --> 1:00:00.222
- I can't.
- What the fuck is goin' on?

1:00:00.306 --> 1:00:01.265
- O-okay, Kevin.

1:00:01.348 --> 1:00:02.975
Don't-Don't be mad.
Don't be mad.

1:00:03.058 --> 1:00:05.060
But this whole thing,

1:00:05.144 --> 1:00:06.937
aside from what just
happened to Josh Hartnett,

1:00:07.021 --> 1:00:08.605
has-has been scripted.

1:00:08.689 --> 1:00:09.648
- What the fuck
is that accent?

1:00:09.732 --> 1:00:11.108
- I was acting,
I'm sorry!

1:00:11.191 --> 1:00:13.319
I'm not from Chicago,
I'm from Essex!

1:00:13.402 --> 1:00:15.904
Claude Van De Velde wanted you
at your most authentic,

1:00:15.988 --> 1:00:18.532
so he hid a bunch
of cameras in here

1:00:18.615 --> 1:00:20.617
to film us playing roles,
doing the stunts,

1:00:20.701 --> 1:00:21.952
all of it.

1:00:22.036 --> 1:00:23.495
But whatever just happened
wasn't part of it.

1:00:23.579 --> 1:00:25.789
Which is fucking insane, Ron!
For fuck's sake!

1:00:25.873 --> 1:00:27.249
- For fuck's sake?

1:00:27.333 --> 1:00:28.459
That's what you
wanna say to me?

1:00:28.542 --> 1:00:30.127
For fuck's sake?

1:00:38.802 --> 1:00:41.138
- Talk in your regular voice.
- All right.

1:00:41.221 --> 1:00:43.640
No, I've lost it now.
I'm in my head!

1:00:43.724 --> 1:00:46.393
- Who does that?
Who does this to somebody?

1:00:58.447 --> 1:01:00.783
Oh, shit. You okay?

1:01:00.866 --> 1:01:04.620
- Oh, god.
I'm such a fucking idiot!

1:01:04.703 --> 1:01:07.498
What was I thinking?
- What the hell was that, man?

1:01:07.581 --> 1:01:08.916
- You want to know
what the hell is going on?

1:01:08.999 --> 1:01:10.042
- You're goddamn right
I wanna know what's going on.

1:01:10.125 --> 1:01:11.585
- I bought some drugs.

1:01:11.668 --> 1:01:14.380
I sold them to the wrong people.
- What?

1:01:14.463 --> 1:01:17.091
- And Rodrigo got mad at me
and we got into a fight.

1:01:17.174 --> 1:01:19.301
And then, I accidentally
killed him.

1:01:19.385 --> 1:01:20.928
- You did kill Rodrigo.
- Yes.

1:01:21.011 --> 1:01:22.304
- I told you
he fuckin' killed him.

1:01:22.388 --> 1:01:24.765
- And that necklace.
That necklace was his necklace.

1:01:24.848 --> 1:01:26.683
I'm a horrible person.

1:01:26.767 --> 1:01:28.852
I'm going straight
to hell.

1:01:28.936 --> 1:01:30.646
- You're goddamn right
you're going to hell.

1:01:30.729 --> 1:01:32.064
What are you doing?
- Claude!

1:01:32.147 --> 1:01:34.024
- What are you doin', Ron?
- Claude!

1:01:34.108 --> 1:01:37.069
Claude, if you're watchin',
you call the cops right now.

1:01:37.152 --> 1:01:38.904
You call the fuckin cops.

1:01:38.987 --> 1:01:41.365
- Senor Wilcox!

1:01:41.448 --> 1:01:43.033
- Oh, shit.

1:01:43.117 --> 1:01:44.785
- My nephew Rodrigo's body
washed up

1:01:44.868 --> 1:01:47.287
4 miles due south
of here!

1:01:47.371 --> 1:01:50.124
A coincidence, no?

1:01:50.207 --> 1:01:52.167
I'm gonna give you
2 minutes.

1:01:52.251 --> 1:01:55.212
Exactly dos minutos
to bring your ass out here

1:01:55.295 --> 1:01:56.588
and face me like a man!

1:01:56.672 --> 1:01:59.174
If not, I'm gonna set fire
to the building

1:01:59.258 --> 1:02:00.676
and burn you
like a chicharone.

1:02:03.429 --> 1:02:06.306
- Snap out of it!
- I can't! It's over!

1:02:06.390 --> 1:02:07.975
- Listen to me,
motherfucker.

1:02:08.058 --> 1:02:10.644
This is why men shouldn't be
left in charge of anything!

1:02:10.727 --> 1:02:13.397
My career is just now
becoming the thing

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:16.442
that I have worked
my entire life towards!

1:02:16.525 --> 1:02:18.902
And I'm not dying because
of you, you fucking idiot.

1:02:18.986 --> 1:02:21.071
- We're all gonna die!

1:02:23.824 --> 1:02:26.034
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck, man?

1:02:26.118 --> 1:02:28.120
- Everybody gotta
calm the fuck down!

1:02:28.203 --> 1:02:30.330
- They're all blanks.

1:02:30.414 --> 1:02:32.332
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- Don't hit me.

1:02:32.416 --> 1:02:34.543
- I'm not gonna hit you.
Look.

1:02:34.626 --> 1:02:37.463
When I first walked through
that door, you told me.

1:02:37.546 --> 1:02:38.755
You said, "Kevin--"

1:02:38.839 --> 1:02:40.966
You said an action hero
is not in here.

1:02:41.049 --> 1:02:43.469
You said it's not in here.
- Uh-huh.

1:02:43.552 --> 1:02:45.179
- You said that it's here.

1:02:45.262 --> 1:02:47.055
It's in your heart, man.

1:02:47.139 --> 1:02:49.600
You know, clearly,
you done made some mistakes.

1:02:49.683 --> 1:02:51.518
And one of those mistakes
involved murderin'

1:02:51.602 --> 1:02:53.270
the nephew of some kind
of drug lord.

1:02:53.353 --> 1:02:55.147
- Oh, god.

1:02:55.230 --> 1:02:56.815
I killed him!

1:02:56.899 --> 1:02:58.984
- I'm not tryin' to
fuckin' upset you, man.

1:02:59.067 --> 1:03:01.195
Listen.
I know that you know.

1:03:01.278 --> 1:03:04.490
I know that you know that
there's an action hero in there.

1:03:04.573 --> 1:03:07.618
And I know that a true
action hero is-is-is tough.

1:03:07.701 --> 1:03:08.869
Is confident.

1:03:08.952 --> 1:03:11.163
And they're unfazed
by the minor details

1:03:11.246 --> 1:03:13.415
that disrupt
your average lay person.

1:03:13.499 --> 1:03:16.835
They will take responsibility
for their shit.

1:03:16.919 --> 1:03:19.213
You go out there
and you tell the truth, man.

1:03:19.296 --> 1:03:21.256
Tell the fucking truth.

1:03:21.340 --> 1:03:23.967
Say Rodrigo's death--
say it was an accident.

1:03:24.051 --> 1:03:26.220
Say it was a fucking accident.
And give 'em--

1:03:26.303 --> 1:03:28.180
Give 'em this.
Here.

1:03:28.263 --> 1:03:29.431
You give 'em this,

1:03:29.515 --> 1:03:31.141
say you wanna make
things right.

1:03:31.225 --> 1:03:32.267
- I wanna make it right.
- That's all you gotta do!

1:03:32.351 --> 1:03:33.936
Say I wanna make it right.
I'm sorry.

1:03:34.019 --> 1:03:35.437
I fucked up.
- I fucked up.

1:03:35.521 --> 1:03:37.481
- I wanna tell the truth.
- I wanna tell the truth.

1:03:37.564 --> 1:03:39.358
- That's it!
- I don't wanna make a mistake.

1:03:39.441 --> 1:03:40.484
- Okay, listen.

1:03:40.567 --> 1:03:43.111
All you gotta do
is be the action hero

1:03:43.195 --> 1:03:46.657
that you wanna see
in the world.

1:03:46.740 --> 1:03:48.951
- Thank you.

1:03:49.034 --> 1:03:50.869
Thank you.

1:03:50.953 --> 1:03:52.454
- Tell the truth, man.

1:03:58.168 --> 1:03:59.586
- That was amazing.

1:04:05.259 --> 1:04:06.593
- Amigos!

1:04:06.677 --> 1:04:07.719
Amigos.

1:04:07.803 --> 1:04:09.221
Peace. Peace.

1:04:09.304 --> 1:04:10.722
- Paz.

1:04:10.806 --> 1:04:12.057
- Paz. Paz.

1:04:12.140 --> 1:04:13.058
- Paz. Paz. Paz. Uh...

1:04:13.141 --> 1:04:15.686
- Shit, it's
actually working.

1:04:15.769 --> 1:04:18.105
Kevin, did you just
save our lives?

1:04:18.188 --> 1:04:20.440
- No. I just know
that being the hero

1:04:20.524 --> 1:04:22.985
means ownin' up
to your mistakes.

1:04:23.068 --> 1:04:26.029
I had to learn
the same thing in my life.

1:04:26.113 --> 1:04:28.991
Just glad that Ron can
learn the same thing too.

1:04:33.328 --> 1:04:35.080
- Shit!

1:04:35.163 --> 1:04:36.582
What the fuck!

1:04:53.473 --> 1:04:55.017
Is he dead?

1:04:55.100 --> 1:04:57.144
- I mean, he took a lot
of bullets. I think so.

1:04:57.227 --> 1:04:58.437
- We gotta check.

1:04:58.520 --> 1:04:59.605
We gotta check to see
if he's still alive.

1:05:03.525 --> 1:05:04.359
He's dead.
- Yeah.

1:05:04.443 --> 1:05:05.319
- He's dead.
- Yeah.

1:05:05.402 --> 1:05:08.071
- He's fuckin' dead.
- Okay. Okay.

1:05:08.155 --> 1:05:10.699
Maybe if we just stay quiet,
they'll leave.

1:05:10.782 --> 1:05:12.743
- I like that plan.
Yeah. Yeah.

1:05:12.826 --> 1:05:13.952
- Juan. Ortiz.
Go inside.

1:05:14.036 --> 1:05:15.495
If there's any witnesses,
kill them.

1:05:15.579 --> 1:05:16.747
- Hide!

1:05:16.830 --> 1:05:17.873
Go!

1:05:17.956 --> 1:05:19.291
- Fuck.

1:05:19.374 --> 1:05:20.709
- Close it, close it,
close it.

1:05:20.792 --> 1:05:21.793
Hold it. Hold it.

1:05:27.924 --> 1:05:29.676
Hey, do we got any more
real bullets?

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.136
- I checked already,

1:05:31.219 --> 1:05:32.387
they're blanks.

1:05:32.471 --> 1:05:33.430
- What do you mean
they're fucking blanks?

1:05:33.513 --> 1:05:35.515
Is everything in here
a fuckin' prop?

1:05:35.599 --> 1:05:36.808
What about the knife?

1:05:36.892 --> 1:05:37.976
The knife
I stabbed you with?

1:05:38.060 --> 1:05:39.853
- It was retractable.
Fake blood.

1:05:39.936 --> 1:05:43.440
- Shit! Are you
fucking kidding me?

1:05:43.523 --> 1:05:45.275
Shit! Go.
Go, go, go!

1:05:58.288 --> 1:05:59.498
- Kevin?

1:05:59.581 --> 1:06:00.999
- Yeah.

1:06:01.083 --> 1:06:02.834
- Um, if anything happens

1:06:02.918 --> 1:06:04.753
and we don't
get out of here alive,

1:06:04.836 --> 1:06:08.131
I just want you to know--
- Stop.

1:06:08.215 --> 1:06:10.926
I love you too.

1:06:11.009 --> 1:06:13.512
- Uh...
- Shit. You were gonna

1:06:13.595 --> 1:06:15.681
say somethin' else,
weren't you?

1:06:15.764 --> 1:06:17.015
You were gonna say it
was nice knowin' me?

1:06:17.099 --> 1:06:18.684
- Yeah.
- Fuck me.

1:06:18.767 --> 1:06:21.144
We're about to die.
You could've at least lied.

1:06:21.228 --> 1:06:22.771
I mean, you've been lying
this entire week,

1:06:22.854 --> 1:06:24.106
wouldn't have made
that big of a difference.

1:06:24.189 --> 1:06:27.025
- I'm sorry.
I was hired to play a role

1:06:27.109 --> 1:06:28.694
and they paid me
a lot of money.

1:06:28.777 --> 1:06:30.320
Like, a lot.

1:06:30.404 --> 1:06:31.488
- You're not making it
any better.

1:06:31.571 --> 1:06:33.198
You're actually making it
a lot worse.

1:06:33.281 --> 1:06:35.158
- Shh.
Did you hear that?

1:06:35.242 --> 1:06:36.618
- Shit.
They're coming.

1:06:36.702 --> 1:06:38.161
Play dead.
- What? No.

1:06:38.245 --> 1:06:39.538
- They'll walk in here,
they'll see that we're dead,

1:06:39.621 --> 1:06:40.497
and then they'll leave.

1:06:40.580 --> 1:06:41.790
- But how-how did we die?

1:06:41.873 --> 1:06:43.500
- I can't hear you.
I'm dying.

1:07:02.811 --> 1:07:04.896
- What the...

1:07:14.781 --> 1:07:16.992
- Oy! Did you hear that?

1:07:17.075 --> 1:07:18.577
- Yeah.
I think it's Ortiz.

1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:21.872
- Oh. Then what the fuck
are you waiting for?

1:07:23.582 --> 1:07:25.333
It's not fuckin'
rocket science.

1:07:38.180 --> 1:07:39.973
- Kick me, bitch? Huh?
Kick this!

1:07:43.602 --> 1:07:46.188
Kick me twice,
shame on me.

1:07:50.776 --> 1:07:52.861
Kick me three times--

1:08:10.128 --> 1:08:12.714
Don't look,
I'm on your fuckin' back.

1:08:12.798 --> 1:08:14.633
Come on, let's get
the fuck outta here.

1:08:22.265 --> 1:08:23.975
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1:08:25.977 --> 1:08:26.895
Come on.

1:08:34.486 --> 1:08:35.403
You think you can
win a gunfight

1:08:35.487 --> 1:08:36.655
with a Colombian
drug lord?

1:08:36.738 --> 1:08:38.907
- No. We don't have guns
in England.

1:08:38.990 --> 1:08:40.242
Didn't you say you're
from North Philly?

1:08:40.325 --> 1:08:42.452
- What are you doing?
I can't take the gun like that.

1:08:42.536 --> 1:08:44.663
Give it to me right.

1:08:44.746 --> 1:08:46.164
- Ron would be proud.

1:08:46.248 --> 1:08:47.999
- Shut up, Ron would be proud.

1:08:48.083 --> 1:08:49.793
Ron would be proud.

1:08:49.876 --> 1:08:51.419
Shit!

1:08:51.503 --> 1:08:54.256
Go. Go, go, go.

1:08:54.339 --> 1:08:56.550
Fuck, fuck, go.

1:09:07.686 --> 1:09:10.272
- Okay. I'm going
to create a distraction,

1:09:10.355 --> 1:09:12.107
and then you're going
to shoot the guy.

1:09:12.190 --> 1:09:13.108
- Yeah.
- Are you ready?

1:09:13.191 --> 1:09:15.110
- I've never been
more ready in my life.

1:09:15.193 --> 1:09:17.821
- On three.
One, two--

1:09:17.904 --> 1:09:19.364
- Wait, wait, wait.
No, don't count like that.

1:09:19.447 --> 1:09:22.576
Go the other way. Three, two--
Like that does better for me.

1:09:22.659 --> 1:09:26.246
- Three, two, one.

1:09:26.329 --> 1:09:27.956
Go, go, go.

1:09:28.039 --> 1:09:28.874
- It's go-time.

1:09:30.709 --> 1:09:32.836
Yeah, motherfucker!

1:09:32.919 --> 1:09:34.504
Yeah, motherfucker!

It's not a fuck yeah.
It's a serious thing.

I learned is that, uh,

1:19:40.318 --> 1:19:45.198
