WEBVTT

00:05.500 --> 00:09.732
Last time on Enterprise

00:13.000 --> 00:19.205
There's been an attack on Earth.
We've been recalled.

00:19.205 --> 00:20.868
The probe was sent by the Xindi.

00:20.868 --> 00:26.438
They learned that their world would be destroyed by humans in 400 years.

00:26.438 --> 00:28.134
Is there going to be some kind of service?

00:28.134 --> 00:29.989
My sister wasn't big on memorials.

00:29.989 --> 00:32.433
She was no more important than any of them.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.773
She was more important to you.

00:34.773 --> 00:37.310
There's nothing wrong with admitting that.

00:37.310 --> 00:39.931
Are you suggesting this is a Xindi?

00:39.931 --> 00:42.073
I sure as hell would like to find out.

00:42.073 --> 00:45.157
You are to return to Vulcan.

00:45.157 --> 00:47.927
I believe that should be my decision.

00:47.927 --> 00:49.713
We received a distress call.

00:49.713 --> 00:53.434
Every crewman on board had been anatomically inverted,

00:53.434 --> 00:57.582
their bodies splayed open, and they were still alive.

00:57.582 --> 01:00.211
I want to remain aboard Enterprise.

01:00.211 --> 01:03.057
I've decided to resign my commission.

01:03.057 --> 01:05.299
Do you think you'll be comfortable with military on board?

01:05.299 --> 01:07.735
I don't have a problem with non-Starfleet personnel.

01:07.735 --> 01:11.142
I'm going to need all the muscle I can get when we cross into the Expanse.

01:11.142 --> 01:14.911
I can't wait to get in there, Captain,
find the people who did this.

01:14.911 --> 01:17.612
Tell me we won't be tiptoeing around.

01:17.612 --> 01:21.808
None of that noninterference crap T'Pol's always shoving down our throats.

01:21.808 --> 01:26.233
We'll do what we have to, Trip.

01:26.233 --> 01:29.062
It could simply be a coincidence.

01:29.062 --> 01:31.364
You're being naive.

01:31.364 --> 01:34.567
Their planet is 50 light-years away.

01:34.567 --> 01:37.628
It is not a coincidence.

01:37.628 --> 01:42.630
How do you know your contacts gave you accurate information?

01:42.630 --> 01:45.469
It's the beginning of an invasion!

01:45.469 --> 01:47.994
Hundreds of Earth ships will follow!

01:47.994 --> 01:51.436
They have no way of knowing that we launched the probe.

01:51.436 --> 01:54.109
We must destroy the ship!

01:54.109 --> 01:56.351
How many humans are aboard?

01:56.351 --> 02:01.358
It doesn't matter. They must be destroyed... before they find the weapon!

02:01.358 --> 02:02.895
When will it be ready?

02:02.895 --> 02:05.139
The next series of tests is being prepared.

02:05.139 --> 02:09.330
We'll accomplish nothing if all you do is run tests.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.584
We must be patient.

02:11.584 --> 02:14.588
We must follow the plan that we all agreed to.

02:14.588 --> 02:19.732
Our future is at stake. This council musn't be divided.

02:21.813 --> 02:27.732
Learn everything you can about this human vessel.

02:29.219 --> 02:33.615
Song: "Faith of the Heart"
It's been a long road,

02:33.615 --> 02:36.931
Getting from there to here,

02:36.931 --> 02:40.426
It's been a long time,

02:40.426 --> 02:44.778
But my time is finally near,

02:44.778 --> 02:49.034
And I will see my dream come alive at last,

02:49.034 --> 02:52.622
I will touch the sky

02:52.622 --> 02:56.303
And they're not gonna hold me down no more,

02:56.303 --> 02:59.902
No they're not gonna change my mind,

02:59.902 --> 03:04.187
Cause I've got faith of the heart,

03:04.187 --> 03:07.701
I'm going where my heart will take me,

03:07.701 --> 03:12.291
I've got faith to believe,

03:12.291 --> 03:14.774
I can do anything,

03:14.774 --> 03:22.519
I've got strength of the soul,
But no one gonna bend or break me,

03:22.519 --> 03:28.190
I can reach, any star,

03:28.190 --> 03:32.153
I've got faith,

03:32.153 --> 03:38.436
I've got faith, faith of the heart.

03:47.596 --> 03:53.673
053 (3x01) The Xindi

03:53.673 --> 03:55.496
How long till we get there?

03:55.496 --> 03:57.125
Another three hours.

03:57.125 --> 03:59.444
Did the freighter captain say who we're supposed to contact?

03:59.444 --> 04:01.362
The foreman of the north mine.

04:01.362 --> 04:03.032
He's expecting us.

04:03.032 --> 04:06.570
What makes this captain so certain one of the miners is Xindi?

04:06.570 --> 04:07.817
He's not.

04:07.817 --> 04:12.178
He just said he thinks there was a Xindi aboard a transport he took there a few years ago.

04:12.178 --> 04:14.011
Then it is safe to enter orbit.

04:14.011 --> 04:16.414
There are no security considerations.

04:16.414 --> 04:21.242
- He didn't mention any.
- With all due respect, sir, we should approach with caution.

04:21.242 --> 04:24.057
The freighter captain was of... questionable character.

04:24.057 --> 04:26.124
Where are we, Malcolm? Sir?

04:26.124 --> 04:28.264
This room, what did it used to be?

04:28.264 --> 04:31.276
A storage bay, sir. Conduit housings, I believe.

04:31.276 --> 04:32.851
But it got retrofitted.

04:32.851 --> 04:36.323
Starfleet went to a lotf trouble to turn it into our new command center.

04:36.323 --> 04:38.366
Why is that, Malcolm?

04:38.366 --> 04:39.723
Because of our mission, sir.

04:39.723 --> 04:41.276
To find the Xindi, right?

04:41.276 --> 04:42.850
Right.

04:42.850 --> 04:47.748
So this state-of-the-art equipment was put in here to help us gather all the pieces of the puzzle;

04:47.748 --> 04:50.376
figure out who's trying to destroy Earth.

04:50.376 --> 04:52.065
Right.

04:52.065 --> 04:57.371
Six weeks. We've been in this Expanse for six weeks.

04:57.371 --> 04:58.963
What data have we gathered?

04:58.963 --> 05:01.635
What pieces of the puzzle have we started to put together?

05:01.635 --> 05:04.574
Not a single one.

05:04.574 --> 05:10.467
We don't have the luxury of being safe or cautious anymore.

05:10.467 --> 05:16.354
And if the only lead we can find comes from a freighter captain of questionable character,

05:16.354 --> 05:18.573
then that's good enough for me.

05:18.573 --> 05:20.436
Understood?

05:25.013 --> 05:29.180
Understood.

05:29.180 --> 05:31.490
Is this seat taken?

05:31.490 --> 05:33.389
Ma'am.

05:33.389 --> 05:34.641
I'm Hoshi Sato.

05:34.641 --> 05:37.919
We've familiarized ourselves with all the bridge officers, Ensign.

05:37.919 --> 05:43.099
I'm Major Hayes. This is Sergeant Kemper.
Corporals Romero and Chang.

05:43.099 --> 05:44.712
Military Assault Command.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.050
Captain Archer wanted the best.

05:47.050 --> 05:49.448
Looks like you've all gotten your space-legs.

05:49.448 --> 05:52.222
Some of us are still visiting Dr. Phlox every morning.

05:52.222 --> 05:55.036
Wonders of modern medicine.

05:55.036 --> 05:56.968
What do you think of our doctor, Sergeant?

05:56.968 --> 06:00.656
I imagine you don't run into many Denobulans in Duluth, Minnesota.

06:00.656 --> 06:02.634
Actually, I'm stationed outside of Atlanta.

06:02.634 --> 06:06.151
No Denobulans, but we have our fair share of alien visitors.

06:06.151 --> 06:08.141
You must have gone pretty deep into our records--

06:08.141 --> 06:10.910
I haven't lived in Duluth since junior high school.

06:10.910 --> 06:14.539
You may have left Duluth, but you've still got plenty of Duluth left in your inflections.

06:14.539 --> 06:16.065
Oh!

06:16.065 --> 06:16.994
Excuse me?

06:16.994 --> 06:19.247
Ensign Sato's a linguist, Kemper.

06:19.247 --> 06:23.247
You give her enough time, she could probably tell you what street you grew up on.

06:23.247 --> 06:25.261
Do you have any idea where we're headed, Ensign?

06:25.261 --> 06:28.831
I'm sure Captain Archer will let us know, when he has reason to.

06:28.831 --> 06:30.418
Let's hope it's soon.

06:30.418 --> 06:34.388
The quicker you folks find these Xindi, the quicker we can get to work.

06:34.388 --> 06:36.181
We have a briefing in a few minutes.

06:36.181 --> 06:37.436
If you'll excuse us?

06:41.925 --> 06:42.889
Just Bay Two?

06:42.889 --> 06:43.686
Yes, sir.

06:43.686 --> 06:45.595
Cargo Bays One and Three seem unaffected.

06:45.595 --> 06:46.732
When did it start?

06:46.732 --> 06:48.057
About ten minutes ago.

06:48.057 --> 06:51.260
Ensign McFarlane got pretty banged up, but he's going to be okay.

06:51.260 --> 06:53.660
And you're sure it's not a problem with the grav-plating.

06:53.660 --> 07:05.089
Trust me, Captain, it's not the grav-plating.

07:05.089 --> 07:06.451
Careful, sir.

07:06.451 --> 07:12.798
Stay close to the door.

07:12.798 --> 07:15.396
Just give it a minute.

07:26.694 --> 07:32.020
You're right, it's not the grav-plating.

07:32.020 --> 07:36.535
Any volatile material in those containers?

07:36.535 --> 07:39.879
I would've known by now.

07:39.879 --> 07:47.007
Seal it off. Let's hope this little anomaly doesn't last any longer than the others did.

08:04.081 --> 08:08.821
Ah, uh... come look at this.

08:08.821 --> 08:12.679
The pigmentation is far more colorful than I would have suspected.

08:12.679 --> 08:14.335
What are we looking at?

08:14.335 --> 08:20.275
Oh, um, Xindi: epithelial cells harvested from the corpse they found inside the crashed probe.

08:20.275 --> 08:21.873
It looks more like scales.

08:21.873 --> 08:31.609
Precisely. When I'm finished constructing my physiometric profile, I wouldn't be surprised to find he has, uh, reptilian characteristics.

08:31.609 --> 08:34.390
You wanted to see me?

08:34.390 --> 08:36.243
Do you have any siblings?

08:36.243 --> 08:37.871
No.

08:37.871 --> 08:40.307
Commander Tucker had one sister.

08:40.307 --> 08:42.196
She was killed in the attack.

08:42.196 --> 08:43.544
I'm aware of that.

08:43.544 --> 08:46.217
He's having difficulty dealing with the loss.

08:46.217 --> 08:47.557
That's to be expected.

08:47.557 --> 08:50.242
More specifically, it's affecting his sleep.

08:50.242 --> 08:54.991
I've been giving him sedatives, but I'd like to see him start, uh, tapering off.

08:54.991 --> 08:57.195
I'm not sure I understand.

08:57.195 --> 09:02.666
I believe the commander would be a fine candidate for Vulcan neuro-pressure.

09:02.666 --> 09:07.500
I doubt the commander would have the patience to sit in one place long enough to get through the first posture.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.418
I'm certain, with your delicate guidance...

09:09.418 --> 09:11.765
"Delicate" is not a word

09:11.765 --> 09:13.715
I associate with Mr. Tucker.

09:13.715 --> 09:19.374
The instruction of neuro-pressure is... a very intimate act.

09:19.374 --> 09:22.835
And he's suffered a very intimate loss.

09:22.835 --> 09:27.388
He needs your help.

09:28.744 --> 09:30.027
Have him come to my quarters.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.837
There's, um... one little problem.

09:32.837 --> 09:37.853
Assuming that you'd agree to my request, I suggested all of this to Commander Tucker earlier today.

09:37.853 --> 09:41.858
He was... less than enthusiastic.

09:41.858 --> 09:43.231
I don't understand.

09:43.231 --> 09:52.676
Perhaps if I could get him to go to your quarters, you might be able to convince him of the lasting benefits of Vulcan neuro-pressure.

10:21.795 --> 10:24.205
We should have worn AV suits.

10:24.205 --> 10:26.946
The doctor said it was safe for short periods.

10:26.946 --> 10:28.684
Safe!

10:28.684 --> 10:30.573
You call this safe?

10:30.573 --> 10:32.894
I've been in...

10:34.816 --> 10:36.914
Try not to breathe.

10:36.914 --> 10:39.010
Yes, sir.

10:55.563 --> 10:57.508
I'm Captain Archer of the starship Enterprise.

10:57.508 --> 11:01.707
- We've come to see...
- This way.

11:36.475 --> 11:40.380
- Archer...
- I'm Jonathan Archer.

11:40.380 --> 11:42.298
This is Lieutenant Reed.

11:42.298 --> 11:52.019
I've been told you might be able to make it worth my while if I were to arrange a certain introduction.

11:52.686 --> 11:55.899
Depends what you mean by "worth your while."

11:55.899 --> 11:59.868
Well, I've always had a fondness for platinum.

11:59.868 --> 12:04.310
Specifically, in its liquified state.

12:04.310 --> 12:07.123
I'm afraid we don't carry precious metals on board.

12:07.123 --> 12:13.009
Mmm, pity.

12:13.009 --> 12:15.408
I'm sure there's something else we could offer you.

12:16.479 --> 12:19.765
I don't make a habit of allowing people to interrupt my workers!

12:19.765 --> 12:22.593
Xindi or otherwise!

12:24.038 --> 12:26.602
What about the antimatter relays?

12:26.602 --> 12:29.806
The lining's all coated with a platinum-cobalt alloy.

12:29.806 --> 12:34.988
Trip could probably strip them down and separate the metals.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.200
How much platinum are we talking about?

12:38.200 --> 12:42.421
Well, I'm a reasonable man.

12:42.421 --> 12:47.988
I'm sure you could part with say, half a liter?

12:49.616 --> 12:53.218
I'd need to see this man, scan him, confirm that he's Xindi.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.555
That won't be necessary.

13:09.211 --> 13:12.182
Why would you do this?

13:12.182 --> 13:15.693
Unfortunate accident.

13:15.693 --> 13:19.447
I expect to see you back tomorrow.

13:19.447 --> 13:21.554
Good day.

13:37.943 --> 13:42.930
Elizabeth! Lizzie, you've got to get out of there!

13:42.930 --> 13:49.199
Elizabeth! Please! Get out of there!

14:11.989 --> 14:14.160
A blood sample would have sufficed.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.358
Some saliva.

14:15.358 --> 14:17.429
Is it Xindi?

14:17.429 --> 14:20.058
Yes... and no.

14:20.058 --> 14:22.816
I need something a little more concrete, Doctor.

14:22.816 --> 14:27.597
The genetic profile is nearly identical to the tissue samples taken from the corpse found on Earth.

14:27.597 --> 14:32.638
Their base pair sequencing is far closer than, say, um, humans and chimpanzees.

14:32.638 --> 14:35.689
Nearly identical, but not quite.

14:35.689 --> 14:38.194
Like humans and Neanderthals?

14:38.194 --> 14:40.614
A reasonable analogy.

14:40.614 --> 14:49.216
After analyzing the remains of the Xindi corpse, I was able to provide the computer with enough data to create this rendering.

14:49.216 --> 14:52.031
However, this humanoid is reptilian.

14:52.031 --> 14:57.636
That finger is not. It's covered with skin, not unlike yours or mine.

14:57.636 --> 15:00.151
But it's Xindi, all the same.

15:00.151 --> 15:04.901
I wish I could be more helpful, Captain.

15:07.131 --> 15:09.472
- Sir
- How's it coming?

15:09.472 --> 15:16.306
We're going to end up stripping more than 200 relays to get half a liter of liquefied platinum, but you'll have it by this afternoon.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.607
Let me know when it's ready.

15:19.442 --> 15:21.789
You okay?

15:21.789 --> 15:24.690
I'm fine.

15:26.388 --> 15:30.269
I got to have something stronger to help me sleep tonight, Doc.

15:30.269 --> 15:31.804
Very well.

15:31.804 --> 15:35.958
Come by at around 2200 hours. I'll see what I can do.

15:35.958 --> 15:38.381
Thanks.

15:44.974 --> 15:48.439
You're aware this stuff is volatile above 30 degrees Celsius?

15:48.439 --> 15:52.726
I'm familiar with the properties of liquid platinum.

15:52.726 --> 15:55.024
I've insulated the outer container.

15:55.024 --> 15:58.541
It should keep everything pretty stable.

15:59.862 --> 16:02.567
There's little more than half a liter in here.

16:02.567 --> 16:07.349
What exactly do you want with our Xindi friend?

16:07.349 --> 16:09.372
He's not very attractive.

16:09.372 --> 16:12.686
Especially after his recent surgery.

16:12.686 --> 16:14.621
I have something to discuss with him.

16:14.621 --> 16:16.216
And what might that be?

16:16.216 --> 16:18.352
I brought you what you asked for.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.412
Now let me see the Xindi.

16:26.021 --> 16:30.895
His work group should be awake in about an hour's time.

16:30.895 --> 16:34.706
It took six of my men half the night to extract this platinum.

16:34.706 --> 16:38.732
I think you could wake him an hour early.

17:11.438 --> 17:13.686
Is trellium D the only thing you mine here?

17:13.686 --> 17:17.978
The only thing. Trellium D.

17:17.978 --> 17:19.538
I'm not familiar with it.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.579
What's it used for?

17:21.579 --> 17:23.701
Insulation.

17:23.701 --> 17:28.754
Mostly for interstellar vessels.

17:28.754 --> 17:32.756
What insulation does your ship use, Captain?

17:32.756 --> 17:35.286
Our outer hull is lined with duranium.

17:35.286 --> 17:39.515
I'd imagine you must have a very large crew.

17:39.515 --> 17:44.772
And why would you imagine that?

17:55.860 --> 17:59.812
Take your time.

18:11.872 --> 18:14.286
Do I have you to thank for this?

18:14.286 --> 18:15.915
The foreman said it was an accident.

18:15.915 --> 18:17.119
Did he?

18:17.119 --> 18:18.687
What do you want?

18:18.687 --> 18:19.911
You a Xindi?

18:19.911 --> 18:21.543
A nine-fingered Xindi.

18:21.543 --> 18:24.193
What do you want?

18:24.193 --> 18:26.419
Where's your homeworld?

18:26.419 --> 18:31.088
You came all the way to this hideous planet, bribed the foreman to see me, for what?

18:31.088 --> 18:33.115
Directions to my planet?

18:33.115 --> 18:35.445
I find that hard to believe.

18:35.445 --> 18:39.035
We have important business with your people.

18:39.035 --> 18:42.662
But you don't know where to find them?

18:42.662 --> 18:47.504
Well, if you want information, you're going to have to help me escape from this place.

18:47.504 --> 18:49.901
What do you mean, escape?

18:49.901 --> 18:51.727
Do these look like volunteers?

18:51.727 --> 18:55.115
We're captives, slaves.

18:55.115 --> 19:00.557
A simple set of coordinates, that's all I want.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.150
I'm prepared to pay you.

19:02.150 --> 19:04.641
The only payment I'm interested in is my freedom.

19:04.641 --> 19:08.344
If you can't provide me with that, stop wasting my time!

19:09.666 --> 19:15.101
I don't know what you're doing in this place and I don't particularly care, but we didn't come here to stage a prison break,

19:15.101 --> 19:18.466
so why don't you just give us the coordinates and we'll all stop wasting each other's time?!

19:18.466 --> 19:20.245
Not until you get me off this planet!

19:20.245 --> 19:24.580
You know, I'm not sure why, but I'm just itching to kick the hell out of you.

19:24.580 --> 19:28.166
Trip, take it easy.

19:35.337 --> 19:36.174
Archer here.

19:36.174 --> 19:40.088
Captain, there are three warships approaching at warp.

19:40.088 --> 19:43.297
Their hull alloys match the mining towers on the surface.

19:43.297 --> 19:44.885
How long before they get here?

19:44.885 --> 19:46.222
Two hours, sir.

19:46.222 --> 19:48.094
Go to tactical alert.

19:48.094 --> 19:49.777
We're heading back to the shuttle pod.

19:49.777 --> 19:52.071
Understood.

19:52.071 --> 19:52.929
Shuttle pod?

19:52.929 --> 19:54.257
You have a starship in orbit?!

19:54.257 --> 19:55.848
Ooh, you made it so easy for them.

19:55.848 --> 20:00.097
Usually they have to go out and find ships to replenish their labor force.

20:03.052 --> 20:06.814
You flew right into their trap!

20:06.814 --> 20:09.442
Archer to Enterprise:

20:10.462 --> 20:11.633
Enterprise, respond.

20:11.633 --> 20:16.733
You might consider waiting for your colleagues to rescue you, but it sounds like they're about to become quite busy.

20:16.733 --> 20:23.102
If you have a shuttle pod on the surface, I can get you to it, but you'll have to take me with you!

20:24.967 --> 20:28.628
There's an audio message coming in from the mine foreman.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.122
This is Enterprise.

20:32.122 --> 20:38.287
I'm afraid your captain and his associate are going to be slightly delayed.

20:38.287 --> 20:45.953
We have three cargo vessels approaching and we've had to begin de-ionizing our landing decks.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.153
How long a delay?

20:47.153 --> 20:49.533
No more than an hour.

20:49.533 --> 20:51.621
We detected your cargo ships.

20:51.621 --> 20:53.540
They're heavily armed.

20:53.540 --> 21:03.701
Trellium D is a highly valued substance, and I'm certain you've noticed that this is not one of the friendlier regions of space.

21:03.701 --> 21:05.557
Can I talk to Captain Archer?

21:05.557 --> 21:07.670
Not at the moment.

21:07.670 --> 21:12.769
He requested to speak to a miner who resides on level 22.

21:12.769 --> 21:14.957
I spoke with him a few minutes ago.

21:14.957 --> 21:20.545
The de-ionizing process prevents us from communicating with the lower levels.

21:20.545 --> 21:25.683
I'll have him contact you as soon as he returns.

21:26.272 --> 21:29.844
Keep trying to reach the captain.

21:29.844 --> 21:33.079
Something doesn't smell right.

21:33.079 --> 21:36.276
I want you to come up with a plan to recover the Captain and Commander Tucker.

21:36.276 --> 21:38.447
Have it in place in one hour.

21:39.481 --> 21:43.447
Get Major Hayes to help you.

21:45.619 --> 21:51.076
Sewage takes on a whole new meaning when it comes from a dozen different species.

21:51.076 --> 21:55.901
31 to be exact.

21:55.901 --> 21:57.540
Help me with this.

22:02.722 --> 22:07.062
There's a lever below your knees.

22:07.062 --> 22:09.921
Pull it up!

22:19.011 --> 22:20.834
Plasma duct 13.

22:20.834 --> 22:23.359
Hasn't been used since I've been here.

22:25.343 --> 22:27.305
Why is there a hatch here?

22:27.305 --> 22:30.165
There's one every eight levels.

22:30.165 --> 22:31.410
What are you doing?

22:31.410 --> 22:34.005
Opening the emergency baffle.

22:34.005 --> 22:35.594
Up there.

22:35.594 --> 22:40.950
It's a steel plate that locks into place during maintenance cycles.

22:41.569 --> 22:45.155
Follow me.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.887
That LZ looks a little close to the mine.

23:05.887 --> 23:07.963
The ionized particles will cover our descent.

23:07.963 --> 23:09.121
We'll be all right.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.082
Have you heard from the captain?

23:10.082 --> 23:10.907
Not yet.

23:10.907 --> 23:14.427
And the foreman isn't responding to our hails.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.217
The ships?

23:15.217 --> 23:16.515
Less than an hour away.

23:16.515 --> 23:18.299
Are you ready?

23:18.299 --> 23:22.188
They're armed to the teeth down there, but it is doable.

23:22.188 --> 23:25.036
We only have one bone of contention.

23:25.036 --> 23:30.342
The major here thinks my security team is far too valuable to bring down and put in the line of fire.

23:30.342 --> 23:31.800
He wants to take his men.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.235
It's a simple matter of priorities.

23:34.235 --> 23:36.811
If those warships get here before we return from the surface,

23:36.811 --> 23:39.204
you could find yourselves dealing with a boarding party.

23:39.204 --> 23:43.040
You'd be in far better hands with a security force who knows Enterprise inside and out.

23:43.040 --> 23:47.218
I plan to have my men back on board with the Captain and Trip long before those ships arrive.

23:47.218 --> 23:53.398
Will all due respect, sir, we can't be certain of that.

23:53.398 --> 23:57.169
The decision is yours, Lieutenant, but I agree with Major Hayes.

23:57.169 --> 24:00.674
Your team may not be back in time.

24:02.339 --> 24:05.467
Select six of your men and meet me in Launch Bay One.

24:05.467 --> 24:07.802
I'll be commanding the mission.

24:07.802 --> 24:09.830
Very good, sir.

24:13.768 --> 24:17.729
Coming from a military family, I've seen men like Hayes all my life.

24:17.729 --> 24:19.076
Lieutenant?

24:19.076 --> 24:23.693
That had nothing to do with who knows Enterprise inside and out.

24:23.693 --> 24:28.991
It had to do with who the Major thinks is more capable of carrying out this rescue.

24:34.581 --> 24:35.578
They're gone.

24:35.578 --> 24:36.971
All three of them.

24:36.971 --> 24:38.102
That's impossible.

24:38.102 --> 24:41.330
We searched the entire cell perimeter.

24:41.330 --> 24:43.965
Post guards at their landing craft.

24:43.965 --> 24:49.230
If they get back to their starship, I'll lose nearly a hundred new workers.

25:01.998 --> 25:06.329
If this leads to the surface...

25:06.329 --> 25:08.691
why didn't you use it before?

25:08.691 --> 25:14.537
The residue in the atmosphere is at least 30 times more toxic than it is down here.

25:14.537 --> 25:21.593
This is the first time I've had the luxury of a ship waiting for me.

25:38.561 --> 25:41.667
The lower levels are hypersaturated with ionized particles,

25:41.667 --> 25:44.822
so you'll have to get within a hundred meters to pick up their bio-signs.

25:44.822 --> 25:47.715
And we've got less than a half an hour to do it.

25:48.871 --> 25:50.585
Duct 13.

25:50.585 --> 25:53.666
They've opened two emergency baffles.

25:53.666 --> 25:55.237
They're nearly to the surface.

25:55.237 --> 25:57.198
We should destroy their landing pod.

25:57.198 --> 26:07.196
No. Too valuable. How long would it take to redirect a plasma flow... ...into that conduit?

26:07.196 --> 26:10.117
I'll see to it.

26:17.023 --> 26:24.682
You've risked your lives to learn where my homeworld is because you say you have important business with my people.

26:24.682 --> 26:27.152
Which species?

26:27.152 --> 26:30.595
Have you ever even met a Xindi before today?

26:30.595 --> 26:33.154
One.

26:34.138 --> 26:36.345
And he didn't look very much like you.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.647
Not all of them do.

26:38.647 --> 26:42.290
There are five distinct species of Xindi.

26:42.290 --> 26:47.226
And five distinct opinions on which one is dominant.

26:48.071 --> 26:51.175
What was that?

26:51.175 --> 26:54.656
That sounded an awful lot like those emergency baffles we opened.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.354
Why would they open the rest?

26:56.354 --> 26:59.977
It'll just help us get...

27:06.967 --> 27:09.067
I thought you said this duct isn't used anymore.

27:09.067 --> 27:10.196
It isn't.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.856
They've obviously rerouted the plasma.

27:15.031 --> 27:18.314
How far up to the next maintenance hatch?

27:18.314 --> 27:19.536
How far?!

27:19.536 --> 27:20.808
I don't know.

27:20.808 --> 27:24.713
I think the safest bet is to head back down to the last one.

27:24.713 --> 27:25.816
I think you're right.

27:25.816 --> 27:28.088
That's where the plasma's coming from.

27:28.088 --> 27:29.884
We should go up!

27:29.884 --> 27:31.854
Suit yourself.

27:33.552 --> 27:34.682
It's too late.

27:34.682 --> 27:35.571
We'll be killed.

27:35.571 --> 27:38.209
Shut up! Just shut up!

27:45.356 --> 27:48.005
We're going to have to pick up the pace, gentlemen!

28:03.016 --> 28:04.334
Wait a minute!

28:04.334 --> 28:05.812
Get out of my way!

28:05.812 --> 28:08.133
What the hell?!

28:17.192 --> 28:19.642
You stupid son of a bitch.

28:19.642 --> 28:24.450
I ought to open this hatch and throw you down into...

28:28.901 --> 28:31.176
They forced me to come with them.

28:31.176 --> 28:33.323
They said they'd kill me if I didn't.

28:33.323 --> 28:36.772
Just now, this one, he tried to throw me into the plasma.

28:36.772 --> 28:38.595
Said they didn't need me anymore.

28:38.595 --> 28:40.510
Thank you! Thank you!

28:40.510 --> 28:43.639
If you hadn't been waiting here, I don't know what I...

28:45.831 --> 28:48.444
Pick him up.

28:54.680 --> 29:01.680
I would've preferred having you join your crew members as new additions to my workforce,

29:01.680 --> 29:08.325
but you turned out to be more trouble than you're worth.

29:08.325 --> 29:10.298
Select a detail.

29:10.298 --> 29:12.402
Take them to the surface.

29:12.402 --> 29:16.037
Shoot all three of them.

30:04.487 --> 30:08.562
- You okay?
- Yes, sir

30:46.119 --> 30:48.248
Nice shot.

30:54.053 --> 30:58.623
Captain!

30:58.623 --> 31:02.927
It took a little doing, sir, but we got through the outer hatch.

31:06.413 --> 31:07.758
Where in the hell do you think you're going?

31:07.758 --> 31:09.344
You promised to take me away from here.

31:09.344 --> 31:11.011
That was before your little performance back there.

31:11.011 --> 31:12.626
No, please, you have to help me!

31:12.626 --> 31:13.573
You had your chance.

31:13.573 --> 31:15.455
The coordinates of my homeworld--

31:15.455 --> 31:17.629
if you want them, you'll have to take me with you.

31:17.629 --> 31:18.492
You're lying.

31:18.492 --> 31:22.448
No, I promise you.

31:29.285 --> 31:30.396
- Reed to Mayweather.- Go ahead

31:30.396 --> 31:32.356
We've got them.

31:32.356 --> 31:34.002
Lock onto my location and set down.

31:34.002 --> 31:36.007
Understood.

31:43.052 --> 31:44.525
Ryan.

32:09.243 --> 32:10.872
Captain?

32:23.800 --> 32:25.471
Both shuttlepods have left the surface.

32:25.471 --> 32:27.443
Is everybody aboard?

32:27.443 --> 32:30.159
Everybody plus one.

32:30.159 --> 32:31.765
The warships?

32:31.765 --> 32:33.142
Still at warp four.

32:33.142 --> 32:35.074
ETA approximately seven minutes.

32:35.074 --> 32:37.922
Tell the pods to dock simultaneously.

32:37.922 --> 32:40.834
Prepare to go to maximum warp.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.526
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

32:56.526 --> 33:01.104
The three alien warships followed Enterprise for nearly an hour, but couldn't keep up with us.

33:01.104 --> 33:05.428
I guess they'll have to look elsewhere for new additions to their "labor force."

33:07.717 --> 33:10.486
Come in.

33:13.716 --> 33:16.841
I'm terribly sorry, Captain, but there was nothing I could do.

33:16.841 --> 33:19.842
I realize how important it would've been to have a Xindi to help us.

33:19.842 --> 33:23.310
He wasn't a particularly helpful Xindi, Doctor.

33:23.310 --> 33:25.080
You'd be surprised.

33:25.080 --> 33:32.183
It was extremely difficult and painful for him to speak, but he managed to dictate this to me before he died.

33:32.183 --> 33:35.588
He said you'd know what it meant.

33:35.588 --> 33:38.618
I'll be damned.

33:38.618 --> 33:40.935
They're the coordinates.

33:47.793 --> 33:52.405
I must've been in the shower for two hours and I still have that crap in my hair, under my nails...

33:52.405 --> 33:53.702
We cleared bio-scan.

33:53.702 --> 33:55.136
That's all that matters.

33:55.136 --> 33:57.522
Yeah. The two new guys who got hurt, are they okay?

33:57.522 --> 34:00.132
The doctor's got them back in their quarters already.

34:00.132 --> 34:05.202
You got to admit, their team did a pretty impressive job down there.

34:05.202 --> 34:07.405
Nothing your guys couldn't have done just as well.

34:07.405 --> 34:09.485
I'm not so sure about that.

34:09.485 --> 34:10.498
See you in the morning.

34:10.498 --> 34:12.496
All right.

34:13.244 --> 34:15.295
Ah, how are you feeling, Commander?

34:15.295 --> 34:16.745
Tired.

34:16.745 --> 34:19.922
You said you'd give me something to sleep.

34:19.922 --> 34:22.370
Very well.

34:25.594 --> 34:29.478
If you wouldn't mind, Commander, I promised T'Pol

34:29.478 --> 34:34.755
I'd take these bio-scans to her quarters, but I still have quite a bit of work to do here.

34:34.755 --> 34:36.793
No problem, Doc.

34:36.793 --> 34:39.637
Thanks.

34:44.475 --> 34:45.983
Sick Bay to T'Pol.

34:45.983 --> 34:47.206
Yes, Doctor?

34:47.206 --> 34:49.530
Commander Tucker is on his way to your quarters.

34:49.530 --> 34:54.703
He believes I just gave him a sedative, but it was only a placebo.

34:54.703 --> 34:57.783
He's had a rather difficult day.

34:57.783 --> 35:00.804
I believe you have your work cut out for you.

35:09.842 --> 35:13.145
Sorry to drop by so late, but, uh...

35:13.145 --> 35:16.589
Phlox said you were expecting this.

35:16.940 --> 35:17.845
Thank you.

35:17.845 --> 35:20.101
Please, sit down.

35:20.496 --> 35:24.007
I don't think I'd be very good company right now.

35:24.007 --> 35:29.303
Anyway, I still have a few more showers to take before I get all this... trellium D off me.

35:29.303 --> 35:31.821
Would you like a cup of tea?

35:31.821 --> 35:34.201
Thanks, but it might keep me up.

35:34.201 --> 35:36.089
The doctor just gave me a sedative.

35:36.089 --> 35:40.502
You're having trouble sleeping, as well.

35:40.502 --> 35:44.083
I never would have pegged you as an insomniac.

35:44.083 --> 35:50.631
I believe the Expanse has been disrupting my REM patterns.

35:50.631 --> 35:53.343
Well, probably nothing a good hypospray couldn't cure.

35:53.343 --> 35:57.091
Vulcan science teaches us to prompt our bodies to create their own medicines.

35:57.091 --> 36:00.268
So, why are you still having trouble sleeping?

36:00.268 --> 36:04.619
The neural nodes that need to be stimulated are difficult to reach.

36:04.619 --> 36:09.337
Hmm.

36:09.896 --> 36:13.654
Perhaps you could help me?

36:14.940 --> 36:17.087
Well, I...

36:17.087 --> 36:18.161
I don't really know if I can...

36:18.161 --> 36:22.739
Three centimeters on either side of the fifth vertebrae.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.992
You can apply considerable pressure.

36:36.923 --> 36:38.931
I'm not sure which of these is, uh...

36:38.931 --> 36:40.888
Right there.

36:40.888 --> 36:42.286
Right here?

36:42.286 --> 36:46.889
A little closer together.

36:46.889 --> 36:50.576
Harder.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.102
Harder.

36:52.102 --> 36:53.526
If I push any harder

36:53.526 --> 36:55.166
I'll knock you over.

36:55.166 --> 36:57.774
Just like that.

36:57.774 --> 37:01.621
Please continue.

37:11.552 --> 37:16.621
That was... far more effective than a hypospray.

37:20.774 --> 37:23.329
Glad to be of assistance.

37:23.329 --> 37:26.857
It would be only fair for me to return the favor.

37:26.857 --> 37:29.693
Please, disrobe.

37:29.693 --> 37:35.160
I'm, uh... I'm really flattered, Sub-Commander.

37:35.160 --> 37:39.153
And don't think under different circumstances I wouldn't jump at the chance to, uh...

37:39.153 --> 37:40.339
Are you implying

37:40.339 --> 37:42.717
I'm making sexual advances?

37:42.717 --> 37:43.994
No.

37:43.994 --> 37:45.218
No.

37:45.218 --> 37:46.448
No, no, not at all.

37:46.448 --> 37:49.872
I-I was just...

37:49.872 --> 38:00.071
You see, the doctor gave me this sedative, and I... think it's starting to work.

38:00.071 --> 38:02.512
The doctor injected you with a placebo.

38:02.512 --> 38:07.094
He sent you here because he wanted me to persuade you to try Vulcan neuro-pressure.

38:07.094 --> 38:10.437
As I predicted, it was a pointless exercise.

38:10.437 --> 38:11.916
Why didn't he just ask me?

38:11.916 --> 38:14.299
He did, you refused.

38:14.299 --> 38:17.928
Oh, so this whole thing was just a setup.

38:17.928 --> 38:20.637
The doctor knows how intransigent you can be.

38:20.637 --> 38:22.031
Intransigent?

38:22.031 --> 38:23.544
Unwilling to compromise.

38:23.544 --> 38:27.562
I know what it means, but it just so happens it's not true.

38:27.562 --> 38:30.389
I'm as willing to compromise as anyone else.

38:30.389 --> 38:33.643
Then take off your shirt.

38:59.903 --> 39:03.975
Sir, we're approaching the coordinates.

39:03.975 --> 39:06.251
Tactical alert.

39:06.251 --> 39:09.272
Stand by weapons.

39:10.333 --> 39:13.359
Any indications that we're being scanned?

39:13.359 --> 39:14.628
No, sir.

39:14.628 --> 39:19.366
No vessels, no signs of technology, nothing.

39:19.724 --> 39:22.112
How many inhabited planets?

39:22.112 --> 39:25.275
I'm not detecting any planets, inhabited or otherwise.

39:25.275 --> 39:26.963
That son of a bitch lied to us.

39:26.963 --> 39:31.399
Phlox said the Xindi used his dying breath to give us these coordinates.

39:31.399 --> 39:32.518
Why would he lie?

39:32.518 --> 39:34.893
Sir, I'm picking up a debris field.

39:34.893 --> 39:36.233
A ship?

39:36.233 --> 39:38.278
It's a lot bigger than that.

39:38.278 --> 39:41.606
Put it up.

39:43.697 --> 39:47.399
It's nearly80 million kilometers long.

39:47.399 --> 39:50.962
It was a planet.

39:51.463 --> 39:57.753
Move us in closer.

40:04.430 --> 40:06.304
How long ago did this happen?

40:06.304 --> 40:11.045
Judging by the field dispersion, approximately 120 years.

40:11.045 --> 40:13.195
I'm pretty sure there was a population here, Captain.

40:13.195 --> 40:16.901
I'm picking up refined metals and traces of alloys.

40:16.901 --> 40:21.116
And some of them match the hull of the Xindi probe.

40:21.116 --> 40:28.701
They're building a weapon, planning to annihilate Earth because they think we're going to destroy their world in 400 years.

40:28.701 --> 40:32.179
How is that possible if their world doesn't exist anymore?

40:32.179 --> 40:34.627
Hasn't existed for decades.

40:34.627 --> 40:41.510
We know the probe that attacked Earth was built somewhere in this Expanse, and it was built recently.

40:41.510 --> 40:45.551
It's logical to assume the new weapon is being developed at the same location.

40:45.551 --> 40:50.572
But if it's not here...

40:52.129 --> 40:54.136
Prepare to go to warp four.

40:54.136 --> 40:57.335
What course, sir?

40:57.335 --> 40:59.454
Deeper into the Expanse.

40:59.454 --> 41:03.743
Long-range sensors are showing increasing numbers of spatial distortions.

41:03.743 --> 41:07.054
You heard me, Travis.

41:14.272 --> 41:17.375
They scanned the debris and left nearly three hours ago.

41:17.375 --> 41:18.384
Their heading?

41:18.384 --> 41:22.027
Toward the Orassin distortion fields.

41:22.027 --> 41:24.385
Then it's unlikely they'll survive.

41:24.385 --> 41:29.164
We can't assume that!I'm sending vessels to destroy them!

41:29.164 --> 41:31.945
If they are the first wave of an invasion,

41:31.945 --> 41:35.457
it would be best for us to remain hidden.

41:35.457 --> 41:38.787
Let them keep searching.

41:38.787 --> 41:46.946
They won't find what they're looking for.Finish the weapon quickly!

41:46.946 --> 41:52.700
Or I'll destroy the Earth Ship. whether this council approves or not!
