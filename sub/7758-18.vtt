12:39.993 --> 12:43.997
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
NONE THAT INTERESTED ME.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.066
YOU WANT
SOME MILK AND OREOS?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.468
- MICHAEL.
- MM.

12:48.501 --> 12:52.005
[chuckles]

13:01.348 --> 13:05.118
[panting]

13:05.152 --> 13:08.355
- JUSTIN!
- COMING.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.529
- CHRIST, DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME
CALLING YOU

13:16.563 --> 13:17.998
FOR THE LAST TEN MINUTES?

13:18.031 --> 13:19.066
- I KNOW YOU THINK
'CAUSE I'M YOUNG

13:19.099 --> 13:21.902
I CAN JUST TUMBLE OUT OF BED
AND LOOK LIKE THIS.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.170
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHY NOT.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.438
I TUMBLE OUT OF BED
AND LOOK LIKE THIS.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.439
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE WRONG.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.375
EVEN AT MY AGE,
IT TAKES TIME AND PREPARATION.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.877
- YEAH, WELL, AT THE RATE
YOU'RE GOING,

13:29.910 --> 13:32.579
PARTYING, STAYING UP
UNTIL 3:00 EVERY MORNING,

13:32.612 --> 13:36.349
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A FACE LIFT
BEFORE YOU GRADUATE.

13:44.624 --> 13:48.161
UH, THIS CAME FOR YOU.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.930
- FROM THE PITTSBURGH INSTITUTE
OF FINE ARTS.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.900
- OH?

14:09.382 --> 14:12.619
- WELL, AREN'T YOU GOING
TO OPEN IT?

14:15.155 --> 14:18.258
- [sighs]
I CAN'T.

14:19.392 --> 14:23.296
- GIVE IT TO ME.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.014
- WELL?

14:48.555 --> 14:51.558
- CONGRATULATIONS,
PICASSO.

14:54.494 --> 14:55.462
[laughs]

14:55.495 --> 14:57.030
- WHOO!

14:57.064 --> 14:58.298
- YES! YES!

14:58.331 --> 15:02.369
[laughter]

15:02.402 --> 15:06.473
[monitor beeping]

15:06.506 --> 15:09.576
- [gasping]

15:15.348 --> 15:16.349
- HEY.

15:16.383 --> 15:19.919
- [labored breathing]

15:21.989 --> 15:24.724
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- SORRY.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.559
I FIND MYSELF SITTING
IN A HOSPITAL ROOM

15:26.593 --> 15:28.195
NEXT TO AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON,

15:28.228 --> 15:29.562
SEEMED LIKE
THE THING TO DO.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.998
- [gasping, panting]

15:31.031 --> 15:33.233
HOSPITAL? HOSPITAL?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.668
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO ME?
AM I ALL RIGHT?

15:35.702 --> 15:37.570
- YOU PASSED OUT AT BABYLON.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.738
- I DID?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.107
- I FOUND YOU LAYING
UNCONSCIOUS

15:40.140 --> 15:42.175
ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR.

15:42.209 --> 15:46.513
- [panting]

15:46.546 --> 15:48.481
- DOCTOR SAID
YOU WERE DEHYDRATED,

15:48.515 --> 15:50.717
AND YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE
WAS REALLY HIGH.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.352
- HOW LONG
HAVE I BEEN HERE?

15:52.385 --> 15:54.554
- SINCE LAST NIGHT.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.758
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GET YOU SOME WATER?

15:58.791 --> 16:01.328
- NO, DON'T GO.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.295
DON'T.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.331
PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.999
[monitor beeping]

16:06.033 --> 16:09.069
- ALL RIGHT.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.103
IT'S OKAY.

16:10.137 --> 16:13.140
JUST CALM DOWN.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.009
[monitor beeping]

16:19.246 --> 16:22.282
- DO YOU HAVE ANY CANDY?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.251
- CANDY?

16:30.190 --> 16:33.793
LIFE SAVERS?

16:33.826 --> 16:37.997
- [crunching]

16:43.070 --> 16:47.507
- MAYBE I SHOULD
GO GET THE NURSE.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.510
- THAT'S OKAY.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.214
DID YOU STAY HERE
THIS WHOLE TIME?

16:54.247 --> 16:56.516
- YEAH, WELL, AROUND 6:00
I WENT BACK TO MY PLACE

16:56.549 --> 16:58.818
TO PICK UP SOME CLEAN CLOTHES
FOR YOU.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.689
YOURS WERE...
PRETTY DISGUSTING.

17:04.424 --> 17:08.561
THE DOCTOR SAID YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO GO HOME LATER.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.197
- WHAT HOME?

17:10.230 --> 17:13.533
I WAS EVICTED LAST MONTH.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.368
- WELL, WHERE HAVE YOU
BEEN STAYING?

17:15.402 --> 17:18.138
- WITH SOME FRIENDS.

17:18.171 --> 17:21.108
- OH, THAT'S--
THAT'S GOOD.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.676
SO THEY CAN LOOK
AFTER YOU.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.545
[monitor beeping]

17:25.578 --> 17:30.317
- THEY'RE NOT
THOSE KIND OF FRIENDS.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.652
[sniffles]

17:32.685 --> 17:34.487
YOU MUST THINK
I'M SO STUPID.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.290
- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE STUPID.

17:37.324 --> 17:40.860
I JUST...

17:40.893 --> 17:45.332
THINK YOU'RE
THIS REALLY SWEET GUY

17:45.365 --> 17:49.436
WHO HAS SOME PROBLEMS
AND NEEDS SOME HELP.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.738
- [sobbing]
I'M GONNA STOP.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.274
I AM.

17:54.307 --> 17:58.111
I'M GOING TO STOP.

18:02.149 --> 18:07.086
[crying]

18:10.257 --> 18:12.625
- SHH.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.265
- HE CAME HOME FROM DINNER
SO TURNED ON,

18:18.298 --> 18:20.733
WE WENT AT IT
ALL NIGHT.

18:20.767 --> 18:24.671
- I'M SURPRISED
HE STILL HAD THE STRENGTH.

18:24.704 --> 18:25.772
AT HIS AGE.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.675
- YOU SHOULD ONLY BE
IN SUCH GOOD SHAPE AT HIS AGE.

18:28.708 --> 18:32.879
- YOU SHOULD ONLY BE ALIVE
AT HIS AGE.

18:32.912 --> 18:36.183
- SO I WONDER
WHY HE WAS SO TURNED ON.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.418
- BECAUSE I'M IRRESISTIBLE.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.453
- BECAUSE THEY'RE
IN LOVE.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.356
AND UNLIKE YOU, THEY DON'T HAVE
TO PROWL AROUND THE BATHS.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.726
THEY FIND EVERYTHING
THEY NEED RIGHT AT HOME.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.361
- SO HOW WAS IT?
YOU SEE ANYBODY CUTE?

18:48.395 --> 18:52.399
- NOT ESPECIALLY.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.770
- LAST TIME I WAS
AT THE BATHS--

18:57.804 --> 18:59.206
OF COURSE
THIS WAS YEARS AGO.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.574
- OF COURSE.
- OF COURSE.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.677
- I WAS IN L.A. VISITING
MY FRIEND, SHELLY.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.279
BUT ANYWAY...

19:06.313 --> 19:08.948
THERE WAS THIS CUBICLE
AT THE END OF THE HALL,

19:08.981 --> 19:12.185
AND THE DOOR WAS OPEN,
SO I GO IN.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.753
AND AT FIRST I CAN'T
REALLY SEE ANYTHING,

19:13.786 --> 19:16.389
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE IT'S DARK
AND I DON'T HAVE MY CONTACTS IN.

19:16.423 --> 19:17.390
- [snorts]

19:17.424 --> 19:19.259
- ANYWAY, THERE'S THIS GUY

19:19.292 --> 19:21.661
LYING THERE ON HIS STOMACH

19:21.694 --> 19:23.530
WITH HIS BUTT UP IN THE AIR

19:23.563 --> 19:28.335
JUST SCREAMING,
"FUCK ME! FUCK ME!"

19:28.368 --> 19:29.702
SO I DID.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.738
AND AFTERWARDS,

19:31.771 --> 19:35.408
I GOT A GLIMPSE
OF HIS FACE.

19:35.442 --> 19:38.478
IT WAS...
[whispering inaudibly]

19:41.481 --> 19:42.615
- NO SHIT!

19:42.649 --> 19:44.751
YOU FUCKED--

19:44.784 --> 19:47.254
- SO SHE REALLY
IS HIS BEARD?

19:47.287 --> 19:49.289
- THEY DON'T CALL HER "WHISKERS"
FOR NOTHING.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.258
- MEOW.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.425
- HEY, GUYS.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.626
SORRY I'M LATE.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.961
I HAD KIND OF
A BUSY MORNING.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.529
- OHH.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.231
- DON'T TELL ME

19:58.265 --> 20:00.567
YOU SAT UP ALL NIGHT
WITH HIM.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.869
- WHO?
- THE ANGEL OF DEATH.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.404
- LOOK, YOU REALLY
HAVE NO IDEA

20:04.437 --> 20:05.405
HOW UPSETTING IT IS
TO WAKE UP

20:05.438 --> 20:06.973
IN A HOSPITAL ROOM.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.275
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.344
- YEAH, THANKS TO HIM.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.648
OKAY.
SO IT'S OVER, RIGHT?

20:15.682 --> 20:20.987
YOU--YOU'VE DONE ALL
YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.455
PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE TELL ME

20:22.489 --> 20:26.926
YOU DIDN'T TAKE
THAT TWEAKED-OUT TRAMP HOME.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.902
- INSTITUTE OF FINE ARTS?

20:35.935 --> 20:38.871
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU'D APPLIED.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.874
- I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU
UNTIL I KNEW.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.876
THEY HAD
OVER 2,000 APPLICATIONS,

20:43.910 --> 20:47.780
ONLY 70 OPENINGS,
AND I GOT IN.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.484
- I ALWAYS TOLD YOU
YOU WERE GIFTED, DIDN'T I?

20:51.518 --> 20:52.652
- [giggles]

20:52.685 --> 20:54.287
- BUT WHAT ABOUT DARTMOUTH?

20:54.321 --> 20:58.491
- OH, I'LL JUST WRITE THEM
AND TELL THEM I'M NOT GOING.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.860
- JUSTIN,
YOUR DAD'S EXPECTING YOU TO GO.

21:00.893 --> 21:04.297
- BECAUSE HE WENT THERE?

21:04.331 --> 21:06.733
- OH, SWEETHEART.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.635
I-I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU WANT TO BE AN ARTIST.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.703
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD IT IS

21:10.737 --> 21:12.572
TO MAKE A LIVING?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.774
- YEAH.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.843
IT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.512
IT'S WHAT
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.481
[car approaching]

21:23.550 --> 21:25.685
[car door opens]

21:25.718 --> 21:27.954
- YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
A HARD TIME CONVINCING HIM.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.923
- I WAS HOPING
THAT YOU COULD HELP.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.091
WILL YOU?

21:32.124 --> 21:34.427
- HI, JENNIFER.
- SUE!

21:34.461 --> 21:35.928
[laughs]
HI.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.664
UM...

21:37.697 --> 21:40.867
THIS IS MY SON, JUSTIN.
- JUSTIN.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.068
- WHY DON'T
YOU JUST GO RIGHT ON IN?

21:42.101 --> 21:44.571
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
- OH, TAKE YOUR TIME.

21:44.604 --> 21:48.408
I'LL JUST WANDER THROUGH.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.344
- WHO'S SHE?

21:55.415 --> 21:57.884
- SHE'S A REALTOR.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.719
- WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

21:59.752 --> 22:03.556
- UM...

22:03.590 --> 22:06.559
I'VE ASKED HER
TO LIST THE HOUSE.

22:06.593 --> 22:08.561
- YOU'RE SELLING THE HOUSE?

22:08.595 --> 22:10.463
- [sighs]

22:10.497 --> 22:14.667
JUSTIN, UM...

22:14.701 --> 22:17.136
YOUR DAD AND I--

22:17.169 --> 22:19.672
YOUR DAD AND I FEEL
THAT WE, UH...

22:19.706 --> 22:24.411
WE NO LONGER--

22:24.444 --> 22:26.145
WE NO LONGER--
AH.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.015
- WHAT? WHAT?

22:29.048 --> 22:30.983
- OH.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.053
WE'RE GETTING A DIVORCE.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.865
- HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY
HOW HOT YOU LOOK?

22:45.898 --> 22:47.500
- ACTUALLY, YOU HAVE.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.736
BUT IT ALWAYS
BEARS REPEATING.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.738
- YOU ARE SO HOT.

22:51.771 --> 22:54.173
- HOWDY, BOYS.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.775
I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

22:55.808 --> 22:56.909
- COURSE YOU DO.

22:56.943 --> 22:59.546
- BUT DO YOU MIND
IF I JOIN YOU?

22:59.579 --> 23:00.780
- WELL, ACTUALLY--

23:00.813 --> 23:04.684
- SODA WATER.
LEMON, NO ICE.

23:04.717 --> 23:08.855
YOU KNOW, AFTER
ANY STRENUOUS PHYSICAL EXERTION,

23:08.888 --> 23:10.757
WHAT YOU NEED
IS PLENTY OF FLUIDS.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.992
- THANKS FOR THE HEALTH TIP.
- ANYTIME.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.062
SPEAKING OF EXERTION,

23:16.095 --> 23:17.997
MICHAEL TELLS ME YOU TWO HAD
QUITE A NIGHT LAST NIGHT.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.632
- OH, JESUS, BRIAN!
- THAT'S OKAY.

23:19.666 --> 23:20.867
MATTER OF FACT, WE DID.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.769
- SO DID I.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.671
- WELL, I DON'T THINK

23:24.704 --> 23:26.172
DAVID WANTS TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR TRIP TO--

23:26.205 --> 23:27.173
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.141
HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T APPROVE.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.210
SO WHAT HAVE
YOU BEEN UP TO LATELY, DOC?

23:31.243 --> 23:32.612
- NOT MUCH, THE USUAL.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.681
- HMM, HMM.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.617
MICHAEL TELLS ME YOU HAD DINNER
WITH SOME CLIENT.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.054
- THAT'S RIGHT.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.557
- TALK ABOUT BORING.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.225
ALTHOUGH
I HAD THIS ONE CLIENT--

23:46.258 --> 23:47.694
MICHAEL TELL YOU
THIS STORY?

23:47.727 --> 23:49.929
MEAT AND POTATOES,
WIFE AND KIDS,

23:49.962 --> 23:53.833
TURNED OUT HE WAS GAY.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.736
AND NOT ONLY WAS HE GAY,
HE WANTED TO FUCK ME.

23:56.769 --> 24:00.540
- IMAGINE THAT.
- YEAH. WHAT CAN I SAY?

24:00.573 --> 24:01.741
THERE'S A LOT
OF DUPLICITOUS PEOPLE

24:01.774 --> 24:03.976
IN THE WORLD.

24:04.010 --> 24:07.013
- HERE'S YOUR WATER, BRIAN.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.148
- CHEERS.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.821
- GOD, I HATE THE COLD.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.122
YOU KNOW,
I ALWAYS FIGURED I COULD

24:16.155 --> 24:18.558
ONE DAY LIVE
IN SOME PLACE THAT'S WARM,

24:18.591 --> 24:22.061
LIKE LA JOLLA,
SANTA BARBARA.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.230
ONE OF THOSE
PICTURE POSTCARD PLACES.

24:24.263 --> 24:27.667
YOU KNOW, BUSINESS
WOULD BE GOOD THERE TOO.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.937
BUT I'M STILL HERE.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.005
- WELL,
MAYBE YOU'RE DECEIVING YOURSELF,

24:33.039 --> 24:35.708
THINKING YOU WANT SOMETHING
YOU REALLY DON'T.

24:35.742 --> 24:39.245
- I WANT MICHAEL.
I LOVE MICHAEL.

24:39.278 --> 24:43.215
WHAT YOU SAW LAST NIGHT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.

24:43.249 --> 24:46.586
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN TO ME, DOC.

24:46.619 --> 24:49.689
I'M NOT A MEMBER
OF THE QUEER P.C. PATROL.

24:49.722 --> 24:50.957
IF YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE BATHHOUSE

24:50.990 --> 24:53.726
AND GET YOUR ROCKS OFF,
I SAY DO IT.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.763
AS LONG
AS YOU DON'T HURT HIM.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.731
- I DON'T INTEND TO.

24:58.765 --> 25:02.134
DO YOU?

25:02.168 --> 25:05.104
- ANYBODY WANT A BITE?

25:07.974 --> 25:11.010
[dishes clatter]

25:11.043 --> 25:12.011
- YOU'RE BACK.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.981
- YOU'RE UP.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.819
YOU FEELING BETTER?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.854
- YEAH, ACTUALLY.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.860
GREAT.

25:27.894 --> 25:28.895
- YOU COOK.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.663
- OH, YEAH.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.031
BOTH MY PARENTS WORKED,

25:32.064 --> 25:34.901
AND I WAS
THE OLDEST OF SEVEN KIDS.

25:34.934 --> 25:35.835
- SEVEN.

25:35.868 --> 25:39.706
- SO I KNOW HOW TO MAKE
A CHICKEN STRETCH.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.876
- WOW.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.846
CANDLES AND EVERYTHING.

25:52.919 --> 25:55.988
[knife chopping]

25:57.724 --> 25:59.225
- WHAT?

25:59.258 --> 26:01.894
- NOTHING.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.162
[timer beeps]

26:03.195 --> 26:05.898
- POTATOES ARE DONE.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.100
HEY, YOU WANT TO PUT
ON SOME MUSIC?

26:17.810 --> 26:20.847
[operatic music playing]

26:20.880 --> 26:24.083
- THAT'S NICE.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.018
WHAT IS IT?

26:26.052 --> 26:29.822
- LA TRAVIATA.
DO YOU KNOW IT?

26:29.856 --> 26:31.190
- NOT REALLY.

26:31.223 --> 26:32.291
- IT'S AN OPERA.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.093
- I FIGURED THAT MUCH.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.295
*

26:36.328 --> 26:38.364
- IT'S ABOUT THIS WOMAN,
VIOLETTA.

26:38.397 --> 26:39.966
SHE'S A COURTESAN.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.768
*

26:41.801 --> 26:42.835
- A WHAT?

26:42.869 --> 26:44.971
- A SLUT, BASICALLY.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.372
AND SHE LIKES TO GO
TO PARTIES A LOT.

26:46.405 --> 26:49.241
- I KNOW THE TYPE.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.243
SO WHAT'S SHE SINGING ABOUT?

26:51.277 --> 26:55.782
- WELL, SHE'S JUST MET
THIS REALLY SWEET GUY

26:55.815 --> 26:57.049
NAMED ALFREDO.

26:57.083 --> 27:01.053
AND HE KIND OF HAS
A THING FOR HER.

27:01.087 --> 27:04.123
SHE'S WONDERING
WHETHER SHE CAN GIVE UP HER LIFE

27:04.156 --> 27:06.025
IN THE FAST LANE
TO BE WITH HIM.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.994
*

27:08.027 --> 27:10.797
- DOES SHE?

27:10.830 --> 27:12.699
- SHE GIVES IT A SHOT.

27:12.732 --> 27:20.673
*

27:22.341 --> 27:25.712
[liquid pouring]

27:25.745 --> 27:28.915
- IT'S GHB.
YOU EVER USE IT?

27:32.852 --> 27:37.289
*

27:37.323 --> 27:39.025
IT'S JUST WATER.

27:39.058 --> 27:47.033
*

27:51.037 --> 27:54.240
THIS, UH, DINNER...

27:54.273 --> 27:59.378
IS SORT OF
A THANK-YOU

27:59.411 --> 28:01.814
FOR BEING SO NICE TO ME.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.750
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

28:03.783 --> 28:08.420
- YEAH, I DID.

28:08.454 --> 28:13.425
ACTUALLY, I WISH
THERE WAS MORE I COULD DO.

28:13.459 --> 28:21.400
*

28:31.844 --> 28:33.012
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:33.045 --> 28:34.947
- WELL, WE DIDN'T GET
VERY FAR

28:34.981 --> 28:36.248
THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE.

28:36.282 --> 28:39.085
- YEAH, I KIND OF CHECKED OUT
IN THE MIDDLE.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.920
- I FIGURE WE COULD JUST

28:40.953 --> 28:44.456
PICK UP
FROM WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

28:44.490 --> 28:52.431
*

29:09.581 --> 29:12.251
[both giggling]
- AAH!

29:12.284 --> 29:14.821
BEHIND YOU.
- OKAY. OOH, OOH.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.156
IT HAS TO BE A SURPRISE.
- OKAY.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.525
[indistinct whispering]

29:19.558 --> 29:20.559
both: [whispering]
ONE, TWO, THREE.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.862
TA-DA!

29:22.895 --> 29:24.363
- OH, FOR ME?

29:24.396 --> 29:27.133
- YES, FOR YOU.
WHO ELSE?

29:27.166 --> 29:30.536
- CHEERS.
MWAH.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.438
- MWAH.

29:32.471 --> 29:35.875
- WELL, GO ON.
OPEN IT.

29:39.045 --> 29:42.882
IT'S FOR GETTING
INTO THE I.F.A.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.416
- IT'S WHAT ALL
THE GREAT ARTISTS USE.

29:44.450 --> 29:48.821
LINDSAY KNOWS THESE THINGS.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.160
HE'S SO SURPRISED,
HE'S SPEECHLESS.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.027
- I KNOW YOU WANT TO GET

29:55.061 --> 29:57.096
INTO COMPUTER GRAPHICS
AND ANIMATION,

29:57.129 --> 29:57.964
BUT FIRST YEAR,
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

29:57.997 --> 29:59.565
TO STUDY
ALL THE TRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES.

29:59.598 --> 30:01.968
STILL LIFE,
LIFE CLASS, COMPOSITION.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.903
BECAUSE NO MATTER
WHAT YOU EVENTUALLY DO,

30:03.936 --> 30:06.138
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE
SOLID, CLASSICAL TRAINING.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.540
- I MEAN, EVEN PICASSO
KNEW HOW TO DRAW PEOPLE

30:08.574 --> 30:12.078
WITH THEIR EYES
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

30:12.111 --> 30:15.247
- THANK YOU, GUYS.
IT IS SO NICE.

30:15.281 --> 30:18.450
BUT I'VE DECIDED
TO GO TO DARTMOUTH.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.895
- ENJOYING YOUR BOOK?

30:28.928 --> 30:31.998
- YEAH, UH,
IT'S A REAL PAGE-TURNER.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.400
- WELL, THEN,
HOW COME YOU'RE ON THE SAME PAGE

30:34.433 --> 30:39.571
YOU WERE ON
AN HOUR AGO?

30:39.605 --> 30:43.042
- I, UH--
I GUESS YOU CAUGHT ME.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.611
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE EASY TO CATCH.

30:45.644 --> 30:48.247
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GO TO
THE TELL-TALE SIGNS, YOU KNOW.

30:48.280 --> 30:51.317
THROWING IN A LOT
OF "UHS" WHEN YOU TALK

30:51.350 --> 30:53.085
TO GIVE YOU TIME TO THINK
OF WHAT TO SAY NEXT

30:53.119 --> 30:56.088
AND COVERING
YOUR MOUTH.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.393
- UH, OBSERVANT.
[chuckles]

31:01.427 --> 31:03.362
[sighs]

31:03.395 --> 31:05.497
I, UH, MICHAEL, I SHOULD'VE
TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.099
- [laughs]
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.334
YOU'LL FINISH YOUR BOOK.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.503
- NO, NO.
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

31:11.537 --> 31:16.142
- WELL, HONEY, WHEN YOU SAID
YOU COULD COME A FOURTH TIME,

31:16.175 --> 31:17.609
I KNEW YOU WERE LYING.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.045
- WHEN I SAID I HAD
A BUSINESS DINNER,

31:19.078 --> 31:23.549
I DIDN'T HAVE
A BUSINESS DINNER.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.352
I WENT TO THE BATHS.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.359
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

31:33.392 --> 31:37.029
- MOSTLY WALKING AROUND.

31:37.063 --> 31:39.631
LOOK, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I DO A LOT, MICHAEL.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.668
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
SINCE WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER

31:42.701 --> 31:43.970
THAT I'VE BEEN THERE.

31:44.003 --> 31:44.971
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.072
- NO, I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.539
- WHAT,
THAT YOU'RE FUCKING AROUND?

31:47.573 --> 31:48.540
- I DON'T FUCK.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.943
- AND THEN YOU COME BACK HERE
AND YOU FUCK ME?

31:50.977 --> 31:52.411
IF YOU GAVE ME ANYTHING--

31:52.444 --> 31:56.015
- NO, I SAID
I DON'T FUCK!

31:58.550 --> 32:01.087
MOSTLY I JUST JERK OFF.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.689
- "MOSTLY."

32:03.722 --> 32:06.425
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
AREN'T I ENOUGH FOR YOU?

32:06.458 --> 32:08.027
- YES, OF COURSE YOU ARE,
MICHAEL.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.361
- WELL,
THEN WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.130
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.532
I GUESS IT'S A THRILL.

32:13.565 --> 32:14.533
I-I--

32:14.566 --> 32:16.668
I WANT THE GUYS TO--

32:16.702 --> 32:18.070
TO THINK I'M ATTRACTIVE.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.005
I DON'T KNOW.

32:19.038 --> 32:21.273
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
I JUST HAVE TO BE

32:21.307 --> 32:22.708
OFF ON MY OWN.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.743
- YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.178
- IT'S THE TRUTH, MICHAEL.

32:26.212 --> 32:30.416
- FUCK YOUR TRUTH,
AND FUCK YOU!

32:30.449 --> 32:33.452
- WELL, WE SHOULD'VE KNOWN
HE WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

32:33.485 --> 32:36.188
- MEN, THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.423
- EXCEPT FOR YOU, MICHAEL.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.325
- YOU ARE A SAINT.

32:39.358 --> 32:40.226
- I DON'T WANT
TO BE A SAINT.

32:40.259 --> 32:43.129
I WANT TO BE
A RUTHLESS, HEARTLESS SHIT

32:43.162 --> 32:46.432
WHO FUCKS WHOEVER HE WANTS
WITHOUT CONSCIENCE OR REMORSE.

32:46.465 --> 32:50.069
- I'M SORRY, THAT POSITION'S
ALREADY BEEN FILLED.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.503
- FOR ONCE I WASN'T REFERRING
TO YOU.

32:51.537 --> 32:54.273
I WAS TALKING ABOUT DAVID.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.442
- I SAY CUT HIM LOOSE.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.144
BASTARD.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.179
SHOW HIM
YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR HIM,

33:00.212 --> 33:01.380
THAT HE
DOESN'T DESERVE YOU.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.549
- AND WHO DOES
MICHAEL DESERVE?

33:03.582 --> 33:05.484
- SOMEONE
WHO WILL CHERISH HIM,

33:05.517 --> 33:08.020
WHO WILL BE FAITHFUL.

33:08.054 --> 33:10.489
SOMEONE FOR WHOM
HE WILL BE THE SUN

33:10.522 --> 33:13.159
AND THE MOON AND THE STARS.

33:13.192 --> 33:16.695
- WHAT FUCKING BETTE DAVIS MOVIE
ARE YOU LIVING IN?

33:16.728 --> 33:18.064
AND WHAT DID YOU THINK
WOULD HAPPEN?

33:18.097 --> 33:20.066
THAT YOU'D BE
MONOGAMOUS FOREVER?

33:20.099 --> 33:21.100
- [scoffs]

33:21.133 --> 33:21.900
THAT IS SO LIKE YOU,

33:21.933 --> 33:24.270
MAKE SOME VILE,
HOMOPHOBIC CRACK.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.438
- HOMOPHOBIC?
- YES.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.275
THAT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE GAY,

33:29.308 --> 33:30.276
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR US
TO HAVE

33:30.309 --> 33:32.544
A LOVING, LOYAL RELATIONSHIP.

33:32.578 --> 33:35.781
- NOT BECAUSE WE'RE GAY.
BECAUSE WE'RE MEN.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.516
- IT'S NO DIFFERENT
FOR STRAIGHT GUYS.

33:37.549 --> 33:40.052
I READ SOMEWHERE
THAT SOMETHING LIKE 64% OF THEM

33:40.086 --> 33:41.253
ADMIT
THEY'VE BEEN UNFAITHFUL.

33:41.287 --> 33:42.588
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.790
I'VE ONLY SLEPT
WITH 32% OF THEM.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.258
[chuckling]

33:46.292 --> 33:48.394
- WHAT, SO I'M JUST SUPPOSED
TO LET DAVID

33:48.427 --> 33:51.730
DO WHATEVER HE WANTS,
WHOEVER HE WANTS?

33:51.763 --> 33:53.299
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

33:53.332 --> 33:56.302
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ESTABLISH
SOME RULES.

33:56.335 --> 33:59.471
YOU KNOW, DECIDE WHAT'S
ACCEPTABLE AND WHAT'S NOT.

33:59.505 --> 34:02.174
- I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THAT.

34:02.208 --> 34:06.078
- WELL, THAT'S FINE,
THEN YOU CAN MOVE BACK IN HERE.

34:06.112 --> 34:10.249
END IT ALL
OVER A HAND JOB.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.518
- I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M ASKING YOUR ADVICE.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.386
- BECAUSE I'M YOUNGER
AND WISER.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.188
- YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.390
- I FUCKING HATE THAT WORD.

34:18.424 --> 34:19.691
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.828
- I KNOW
HE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH,

34:22.861 --> 34:26.132
AND I'VE GOT
TO GIVE HIM CREDIT.

34:26.165 --> 34:29.168
I WAS SURE HE WOULDN'T.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.604
- YOU MEAN YOU KNEW?

34:35.207 --> 34:39.511
- REMEMBER BACK, LAST NIGHT,
AFTER I LEFT YOU,

34:39.545 --> 34:40.712
WHERE DID I GO?

34:40.746 --> 34:42.448
- THE BATHS.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.316
- AND WHERE DID HE GO?

34:44.350 --> 34:47.386
- OH, SHIT.

34:47.419 --> 34:50.156
DID YOU AND HE--

34:50.189 --> 34:52.891
- NO.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.626
- AND YOU WEREN'T GOING
TO TELL ME?

34:54.660 --> 34:56.128
- IF I HAD,
YOU'D PROBABLY THINK

34:56.162 --> 34:57.663
I WAS TRYING
TO BREAK YOU UP.

34:57.696 --> 35:00.132
ANYWAYS,
IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS

35:00.166 --> 35:02.868
WHAT GOES ON
BETWEEN YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.870
- WELL, IF HE COULD DO IT,
MAYBE I SHOULD TOO.

35:04.903 --> 35:07.439
- THEN DO IT.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.175
ONLY STOP CARRYING ON

35:09.208 --> 35:13.579
LIKE SOME BETRAYED
LITTLE HOUSEWIFE.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.347
- 25 BUCKS.

35:15.381 --> 35:18.184
[operatic music playing]

35:18.217 --> 35:22.288
- HI. I WANT TO GET
15 ON PUMP 2.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.392
HOLD ON.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.627
MY WALLET MUST HAVE
FALLEN OUT.

35:28.660 --> 35:36.602
*

36:16.442 --> 36:18.444
- HEY.

36:18.477 --> 36:19.811
- WHERE WERE YOU?

36:19.845 --> 36:22.748
- I WENT OUT...

36:22.781 --> 36:27.319
TO GET YOU THIS.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.554
- "THAIS."

36:28.587 --> 36:29.955
- I ASKED THE GUY AT THE STORE

36:29.988 --> 36:32.391
IF HE KNEW ANOTHER GOOD OPERA
ABOUT A SLUT.

36:32.424 --> 36:33.959
- THIS IS EXPENSIVE.

36:33.992 --> 36:36.262
- I DON'T CARE
HOW MUCH IT COSTS.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.963
- I DO.
HOW'D YOU PAY FOR IT?

36:37.996 --> 36:39.531
YOU TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A CENT.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.501
- I GOT A FRIEND OF MINE
TO GIVE ME BACK

36:42.534 --> 36:43.969
THE MONEY HE OWED ME.

36:44.002 --> 36:47.005
- AND YOU SPENT ALL OF IT ON ME.
- NOT ALL OF IT.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.342
- LOOK,
YOU CAN KEEP THE CASH. OKAY?

36:50.376 --> 36:51.543
I-I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.712
JUST PLEASE GIVE IT
BACK TO ME,

36:53.745 --> 36:55.814
SO I DON'T HAVE TO CANCEL
ALL MY CARDS.

36:55.847 --> 36:58.016
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
GIVE WHAT BACK?

36:58.049 --> 37:01.820
- GOD, YOU MUST THINK
THAT I'M JUST SO PATHETIC.

37:01.853 --> 37:04.490
MY WALLET.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.992
- I SWEAR TO YOU,

37:07.025 --> 37:10.262
I DID NOT TAKE IT.

37:10.296 --> 37:13.865
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
I BELIEVE YOU.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.668
IT JUST WALKED AWAY
ON ITS OWN.

37:16.702 --> 37:19.971
SO IF YOU HAPPEN TO SEE IT OUT
WALKING AROUND THE STREETS,

37:20.005 --> 37:21.673
WOULD YOU PLEASE ASK IT
TO COME HOME?

37:21.707 --> 37:23.975
GET OUT OF HERE.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.577
- WHERE?

37:25.611 --> 37:27.379
- WHEREVER THE FUCK
YOU WOULD'VE GONE

37:27.413 --> 37:29.348
IF I HADN'T PICKED YOU UP
OFF THAT BATHROOM FLOOR,

37:29.381 --> 37:33.652
TAKEN YOU TO THE HOSPITAL,
AND BROUGHT YOU BACK HERE.

37:36.988 --> 37:40.258
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR CLOTHES?

37:42.093 --> 37:43.962
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
KEEP 'EM.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.564
I DON'T WANT THEM.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.965
AND HERE.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.301
RETURN THIS FOR THE MONEY
YOUR FRIEND GAVE YOU.

37:49.335 --> 37:51.737
I ALREADY HAVE IT.

37:51.770 --> 37:52.804
[door slams]

37:52.838 --> 37:58.744
[sewing machine rattles]

38:00.111 --> 38:01.713
- HEY!

38:01.747 --> 38:03.715
WHAT AM I,
THE INVISIBLE WOMAN?

38:03.749 --> 38:06.618
COME BACK HERE.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.554
I WAS TAKING OUT
THE GARBAGE.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.922
IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU FIND
IN THE GARBAGE, EVEN YOUR OWN.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.425
AND LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

38:13.459 --> 38:14.460
HUH?

38:14.493 --> 38:15.461
LUCKILY I RETRIEVED THEM

38:15.494 --> 38:17.329
BEFORE THE PATINA
OF MY PESTO

38:17.363 --> 38:18.830
FROM LAST NIGHT
GOT ALL OVER THEM.

38:18.864 --> 38:19.965
- I DON'T WANT THEM.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.600
- YOU DON'T WANT THEM?

38:21.633 --> 38:24.503
- THAT'S WHY
I THREW THEM AWAY.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.838
- BUT THESE ARE
WORKS OF ART.

38:26.872 --> 38:29.007
I MEAN,
LOOK AT THIS.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.442
LOOK AT THIS ONE.

38:30.476 --> 38:33.612
I MEAN,
YOU COULD FRAME THEM.

38:33.645 --> 38:37.949
- THEN YOU KEEP THEM.
I'M GIVING IT UP.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.452
- HOLD IT.

38:43.655 --> 38:49.094
GET YOUR BUBBLE BUTT
BACK HERE.

38:49.127 --> 38:50.962
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE GIVING IT UP?

38:50.996 --> 38:52.364
- JUST WHAT I SAID.

38:52.398 --> 38:55.133
- WELL,
YOU DON'T JUST GIVE IT UP.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.536
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE GIVING UP
EATING OR BREATHING.

38:57.569 --> 39:00.806
- I'M STILL
INHALING AND EXHALING.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.073
CALL ME
WHEN DINNER'S READY.

39:02.107 --> 39:05.877
- YOU WATCH YOUR MOUTH,
SMARTASS.

39:05.911 --> 39:08.547
YOU'RE AN ARTIST,
AND YOU GOT A GIFT.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.782
- BIG DEAL.
- IT IS A BIG DEAL.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.851
THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT WAS GIVEN TO YOU.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.753
- WELL, I DIDN'T ASK FOR IT,
AND I DON'T WANT IT.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.388
- WELL, IT'S TOO LATE.

39:16.422 --> 39:18.056
IT'S YOURS.
IT'S WHO YOU ARE.

39:18.089 --> 39:21.727
- IT'S NOT WHO I AM.

39:21.760 --> 39:26.064
I'M GOING TO DARTMOUTH,
AND I'M GETTING AN MBA.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.634
THAT'S WHAT
MY PARENTS WANT.

39:31.136 --> 39:32.871
- WELL, ALL DUE RESPECT
TO YOUR MOTHER,

39:32.904 --> 39:34.740
WHO'S A VERY LOVELY LADY,

39:34.773 --> 39:36.742
WHO GIVES A SHIT
WHAT THEY WANT?

39:36.775 --> 39:39.044
THIS IS YOUR LIFE.

39:42.914 --> 39:46.518
- DEB,

39:46.552 --> 39:50.689
I'VE CAUSED THEM
SO MUCH TROUBLE.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.559
THEY'RE GETTING
A DIVORCE.

39:56.528 --> 39:59.965
- HONEY.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.934
JUSTIN.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.573
SUNSHINE, YOU DIDN'T BREAK UP
THEIR MARRIAGE.

40:07.606 --> 40:11.510
NO KID HAS THE POWER
TO DO THAT.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.811
JUST LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE
THE POWER

40:12.844 --> 40:15.914
TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER.

40:15.947 --> 40:21.052
BUT YOU DO HAVE THE POWER
TO FUCK UP YOUR OWN LIFE.

40:21.086 --> 40:24.723
SO MAKE SURE YOU THINK TWICE
BEFORE YOU DO IT.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.211
- HEY.

40:46.244 --> 40:48.747
- OH, HI.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.549
I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.584
- YEAH, WELL,
IT'S A LITTLE OUT OF THE WAY.

40:52.618 --> 40:55.654
- YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD BE ALONE, YOU KNOW.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.956
TALK, GO FOR A WALK.

40:57.989 --> 41:01.593
- YEAH, SURE.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.094
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
YOU CALLED.

41:03.128 --> 41:05.964
- ME NEITHER.

41:05.997 --> 41:09.768
- YOU KNOW, AFTER WHAT YOU TOLD
ME ABOUT YOU AND YOUR LOVER.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.637
- WELL, YEAH.
YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.572
THINGS CHANGE.

41:13.605 --> 41:15.206
- SO NOW IT'S ALL RIGHT
TO MESS AROUND?

41:15.240 --> 41:18.243
- LOOK, CAN WE NOT TALK
ABOUT IT, OKAY?

41:18.276 --> 41:20.178
- SURE.

41:30.255 --> 41:33.158
- HONEY, YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.861
YOU SHOULD FEEL VERY GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.596
- I DO, CAN'T YOU TELL?

41:37.629 --> 41:38.864
WHOO-HOO.

41:38.897 --> 41:40.699
- I'M SERIOUS.

41:40.732 --> 41:44.102
YOU TOLD THAT THIEVING PIECE
OF DRUGGIE DISCO TRASH

41:44.135 --> 41:45.871
TO GET LOST.

41:45.904 --> 41:48.273
IF THERE WERE A MAGAZINE
CALLED SELF-ESTEEM,

41:48.306 --> 41:50.141
YOU'D BE THE COVER BOY.

41:50.175 --> 41:54.012
YOU'RE THE IMAGE OF DIGNITY.

41:54.045 --> 41:57.883
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

41:57.916 --> 41:59.818
- YOU'RE THE IMAGE
OF DIGNITY.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.887
- [blows raspberry]

42:03.755 --> 42:05.624
- HE WAS PRACTICALLY
IN TEARS, EMMETT.

42:05.657 --> 42:07.025
- YEAH, BECAUSE HE KNEW
YOU'D CANCEL

42:07.058 --> 42:09.027
YOUR CREDIT CARDS
BEFORE HE HIT THE JACKPOT.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.762
- NO, IT SEEMED SINCERE.

42:10.796 --> 42:11.663
- PLEASE.

42:11.697 --> 42:13.331
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE
A DESPERATE QUEEN

42:13.364 --> 42:15.567
TO FALL
FOR THAT 11:00 NUMBER.

42:15.601 --> 42:17.335
WHICH YOU'RE NOT.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.770
- WHAT IF SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO HIM?

42:18.804 --> 42:20.939
WHAT IF--

42:20.972 --> 42:22.073
WHAT IF HE STARTS HUSTLING?

42:22.107 --> 42:23.174
WHAT IF I FOUND OUT
THAT HE'D DIED?

42:23.208 --> 42:25.310
I'D HAVE THAT ON MY CONSCIENCE
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

42:25.343 --> 42:27.112
- OH, MY GOD.

42:27.145 --> 42:30.916
YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING
TO TOO MANY OPERAS.

42:30.949 --> 42:35.286
SWEETIE, YOU OFFERED HIM
YOUR HOME, YOUR TRUST.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.789
YOU LITERALLY GAVE HIM
THE CLOTHES OFF YOUR BACK.

42:37.823 --> 42:40.058
SOMETHING, BY THE WAY,
THAT I WOULD NEVER DO.

42:40.091 --> 42:41.993
AND HOW DID HE REPAY YOU?

42:42.027 --> 42:45.230
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

42:47.699 --> 42:50.702
YOU'RE RIGHT.

42:50.736 --> 42:53.338
WHEN AM I EVER GOING
TO LEARN?

42:55.240 --> 42:58.944
- WELL, COME ON.
LET'S GO TO BABYLON.

42:58.977 --> 43:00.846
DOZENS OF BEAUTIFUL MEN
WILL REJECT YOU,

43:00.879 --> 43:05.150
AND YOU'LL FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER.

43:11.156 --> 43:14.359
- WHAT'S THAT?

43:14.392 --> 43:17.028
- OH, NOTHING.

43:17.062 --> 43:19.164
JUST MY WALLET!

43:19.197 --> 43:22.668
- * CARRY US AWAY

43:22.701 --> 43:24.770
- SO YOU MISJUDGED HIM.

43:24.803 --> 43:26.404
YOU KNOW, YOU SAID
A LOT OF TERRIBLE THINGS

43:26.437 --> 43:27.405
THAT WEREN'T TRUE.

43:27.438 --> 43:30.041
- ME?
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

43:30.075 --> 43:31.109
- WELL, EVERYONE KNOWS

43:31.142 --> 43:33.244
I'M A TERRIBLE JUDGE
OF CHARACTER.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.681
- YEAH, JUST LOOK
AT WHO HE HANGS OUT WITH.

43:35.714 --> 43:37.148
[chuckling]

43:37.182 --> 43:40.351
- I GOT TO FIND HIM.
APOLOGIZE.

43:40.385 --> 43:42.220
- YOU SHOULD LOOK
ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR.

43:42.253 --> 43:44.122
- FUCK YOU!

43:44.155 --> 43:46.992
- I SAID I WANT A BEER.

43:47.025 --> 43:50.962
- NOT WITHOUT I.D.

43:50.996 --> 43:52.130
- WHO DO YOU HAVE TO FUCK
TO GET

43:52.163 --> 43:53.865
A GODDAMN DRINK
AROUND HERE?

43:53.899 --> 43:55.867
- ME.

43:55.901 --> 43:59.404
TWO BEERS.

43:59.437 --> 44:02.373
I'M THIRSTY.

44:08.379 --> 44:10.281
TO DARTMOUTH.

44:10.315 --> 44:12.150
AND TO YOUR BRIGHT,
SHINING FUTURE

44:12.183 --> 44:14.285
AS PITTSBURGH'S
NEW ANDY CARNEGIE.

44:14.319 --> 44:16.454
- I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

44:16.487 --> 44:19.991
- ONLY I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO BE THE NEXT ANDY WARHOL.

44:20.025 --> 44:22.193
- I CHANGED MY MIND.

44:22.227 --> 44:24.062
- AND AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE
I WENT TO

44:24.095 --> 44:27.733
TO MAKE YOU THE BEST HOMOSEXUAL
I COULD.

44:27.766 --> 44:29.868
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'D BLOW IT.

44:29.901 --> 44:32.771
AND WITH THE FLIMSIEST EXCUSE.

44:32.804 --> 44:35.741
"I'VE CAUSED MY PARENTS
ENOUGH PAIN."

44:35.774 --> 44:39.811
HOW CAN YOU EVEN STAND THERE
AND LOOK ME IN THE EYE?

44:39.845 --> 44:42.447
- IT'S TRUE.
- IT'S BULLSHIT.

44:42.480 --> 44:47.018
THEY CAUSE THEIR OWN PAIN
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

44:47.052 --> 44:49.187
AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE UP
EVERYTHING YOU WANT

44:49.220 --> 44:51.790
JUST TO MAKE THEM HAPPY?

44:51.823 --> 44:53.925
THAT IS TOTALLY FUCKED.

44:53.959 --> 44:57.195
- SHUT UP, BRIAN!
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

44:57.228 --> 44:59.464
- I KNOW IT'S SCARIER
FINDING YOUR OWN WAY

44:59.497 --> 45:02.067
THAN DOING WHAT'S EXPECTED.

45:02.100 --> 45:03.735
- I'M NOT SCARED.

45:03.769 --> 45:06.204
- YOU'RE FUCKING TERRIFIED.

45:06.237 --> 45:09.975
JUST LIKE THE NIGHT
YOU MET ME.

45:10.008 --> 45:14.112
I WAS SURE
YOU'D RUN BACK HOME.

45:14.145 --> 45:17.182
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

45:17.215 --> 45:20.085
YOU SAID...

45:20.118 --> 45:22.253
"I'M GOING WITH HIM."

45:26.291 --> 45:28.960
- I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU REMEMBER THAT.

45:28.994 --> 45:31.830
CONSIDERING
YOU COULDN'T REMEMBER MY NAME.

45:31.863 --> 45:36.835
- AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.
- MM.

45:36.868 --> 45:39.838
I TURNED
INTO A BIG QUEER.

45:39.871 --> 45:41.039
- YEAH, LUCKY FOR YOU.

45:41.072 --> 45:43.809
OTHERWISE,
I WOULDN'T BE WASTING MY TIME.

45:43.842 --> 45:48.113
BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

45:48.146 --> 45:51.249
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

45:51.282 --> 45:59.224
*

46:09.434 --> 46:12.137
- * ETERNAL DANCE

46:12.170 --> 46:15.573
* CARRY US AWAY

46:15.606 --> 46:19.878
* TO A BRIGHT TOMORROW

46:19.911 --> 46:23.882
* A BRIGHTER DAY

46:23.915 --> 46:27.552
* ETERNAL DANCE

46:27.585 --> 46:30.956
* OF LOVE'S DISPLAY

46:30.989 --> 46:33.925
* NO SPACE IN TIME

46:33.959 --> 46:38.563
* TEARING US AWAY

46:38.596 --> 46:44.836
*

46:56.381 --> 46:58.884
- I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

46:58.917 --> 47:00.085
- WELL, YOU COULD'VE CALLED.

47:00.118 --> 47:02.420
- I DID.
YOUR CELL PHONE WAS OFF.

47:02.453 --> 47:04.189
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

47:04.222 --> 47:06.524
- I'M REORGANIZING CDs.

47:06.557 --> 47:08.960
BEFORE THAT, I DID DVDs.

47:08.994 --> 47:11.629
I DID THE BOOKS,
I DID THE MEDICINE CABINET,

47:11.662 --> 47:14.332
I DID THE STEMWARE.
WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU?

47:14.365 --> 47:16.601
- OUT.

47:16.634 --> 47:19.337
- WITH THE BOYS?
AT THE MOVIES?

47:19.370 --> 47:22.941
- I WAS WITH SOMEONE.

47:26.311 --> 47:28.079
THERE WAS THIS GUY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT

47:28.113 --> 47:31.216
THAT I MET THE OTHER NIGHT
AT BABYLON.

47:31.249 --> 47:33.084
HE GAVE ME
HIS PHONE NUMBER.

47:33.118 --> 47:35.520
HE WAS REALLY HOT,
AND I WAS ATTRACTED TO HIM.

47:35.553 --> 47:37.488
SO I FIGURED, YOU KNOW,
WHAT THE HECK?

47:37.522 --> 47:39.490
SO I CALLED HIM UP.

47:39.524 --> 47:41.326
- YOU DON'T NEED TO GIVE ME
ALL THE DETAILS, MICHAEL.

47:41.359 --> 47:44.896
- YEAH, I DO.

47:44.930 --> 47:50.535
WE HOOKED UP,
AND WE WENT BACK TO HIS PLACE.

47:50.568 --> 47:54.372
AND WE STARTED
FOOLING AROUND.

47:54.405 --> 47:58.643
AND HE WAS GIVING ME
A BLOW JOB...

48:00.645 --> 48:03.114
WHEN I SUDDENLY REALIZED

48:03.148 --> 48:06.351
I DIDN'T WANT MY DICK
IN HIS MOUTH.

48:06.384 --> 48:09.487
SO I TOLD HIM TO STOP.

48:09.520 --> 48:13.691
AND I LEFT,
AND I CAME HOME.

48:13.724 --> 48:16.227
- WHY?

48:18.163 --> 48:19.130
I-I MEAN,

48:19.164 --> 48:21.199
WHY DID YOU TELL HIM
TO STOP?

48:21.232 --> 48:24.402
- BECAUSE IT
DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

48:24.435 --> 48:29.107
IT WAS JUST SEX.

48:29.140 --> 48:32.443
AND WITH US, IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

48:40.051 --> 48:41.953
- I PROMISE
I WON'T GO THERE ANYMORE.

48:41.987 --> 48:44.655
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

48:44.689 --> 48:46.691
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO PROMISE.

48:46.724 --> 48:49.560
IT MIGHT NOT BE A PROMISE
YOU CAN KEEP.

48:49.594 --> 48:51.029
AND THE SAME GOES FOR ME.

48:51.062 --> 48:53.298
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU
THAT SOMEDAY,

48:53.331 --> 48:55.433
SOMETHING WON'T HAPPEN.

48:55.466 --> 48:57.002
WE'RE GUYS.

48:57.035 --> 48:59.304
AND GUYS SLIP UP.
WE DO.

48:59.337 --> 49:03.374
ALL WE CAN DO IS
BE REALISTIC ABOUT IT

49:03.408 --> 49:06.978
AND KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WE DON'T LOVE EACH OTHER.

49:11.049 --> 49:14.585
AND JUST TAKE IT
FROM THERE.

49:16.187 --> 49:19.124
- [sighs]

49:23.561 --> 49:27.732
YOU WANT TO HELP ME
GET THINGS BACK IN ORDER?

49:27.765 --> 49:32.570
- SURE.

49:32.603 --> 49:37.142
- * IT'S NOT
JUST A DREAM *

49:37.175 --> 49:39.744
- CAN WE FINISH THIS
IN THE MORNING?

49:39.777 --> 49:44.549
- * IT'S NOT
JUST A DREAM *

49:44.582 --> 49:46.317
* I'M FULLY AWAKE

49:46.351 --> 49:51.222
* AND I
DON'T WANT TO BE *

49:51.256 --> 49:53.491
* LIVING THE LIFE

49:53.524 --> 49:59.064
* THAT MY DADDY
PLANNED FOR ME *

49:59.097 --> 50:01.632
* HE SAID,
"I LOVE YOU, I DO" *

50:01.666 --> 50:06.304
* BECAME MAN AND WIFE

50:06.337 --> 50:09.607
* RAISED ME AS A SON,
I KNOW *

50:09.640 --> 50:13.511
* BUT IT'S
STILL MY LIFE *

50:13.544 --> 50:17.148
* NOW I'M
AT THE CROSSROADS *

50:17.182 --> 50:20.351
* A BIG CHOICE TO MAKE

50:20.385 --> 50:23.354
* AND MY DREAMS,
MY HOPES *

50:23.388 --> 50:28.126
* OR A BIG MISTAKE

50:28.159 --> 50:30.561
* I DON'T NEED ADVICE

50:30.595 --> 50:35.133
* THAT'S GIVEN FOR FREE

50:35.166 --> 50:36.534
* BUT I CAN HEAR

50:36.567 --> 50:39.570
* A STILL SMALL VOICE

50:39.604 --> 50:43.341
* DEEP INSIDE OF ME

50:43.374 --> 50:47.145
* NO, I'M NOT
JUST DREAMING *

50:47.178 --> 50:50.615
* GOTTA FOLLOW MY DREAM

50:50.648 --> 50:54.152
* NO, I'M NOT
JUST DREAMING *

50:54.185 --> 50:58.356
* IT'S NOT AS EASY
AS IT SEEMS *

50:58.389 --> 51:00.425
* I'M GONNA FOLLOW

51:00.458 --> 51:05.563
* MY DREAMS

51:05.596 --> 51:09.167
*

51:09.200 --> 51:11.436
* AIN'T GOT NO MONEY

51:11.469 --> 51:16.507

SO MUCH TIME *

51:16.541 --> 51:18.476
* GOTTA SORT IT ALL OUT

51:18.509 --> 51:24.315
* THERE'S A MOUNTAIN
TO CLIMB *

51:24.349 --> 51:27.618
* STEP BY STEP

51:27.652 --> 51:31.489
* AND STONE BY STONE

51:31.522 --> 51:35.160
* GONNA REACH THE SUMMIT

51:35.193 --> 51:38.629
* ALL ON MY OWN

51:38.663 --> 51:46.637

51:56.914 --> 52:00.418
* GOTTA FOLLOW MY DREAM

52:00.451 --> 52:04.489

52:04.522 --> 52:08.659
* IT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT SEEMS

52:08.693 --> 52:12.230
* WHEN I COME HOME

52:12.263 --> 52:15.366
* MY DREAM WON'T STOP

52:15.400 --> 52:19.604
* I'LL ALWAYS BE STANDING
ON THE MOUNTAINTOP *
