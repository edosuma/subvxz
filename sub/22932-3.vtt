00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:18.170 --> 00:19.330
Can someone
pass the dressing?

00:24.880 --> 00:27.960
Sorry. Rachel was
supposed to be there.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.380
Okay, that's it.

00:29.380 --> 00:30.540
We've lost the ranch,

00:30.540 --> 00:32.420
two rolls,
and the butter.

00:32.420 --> 00:35.420
It's time to say what
we've all been trying to ignore.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.420
It's weird Rachel's gone.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.670
Harley's right;
we're a Diaz down.

00:39.670 --> 00:40.960
Things just
aren't the same.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.460
Dancing With My Dad?

00:43.460 --> 00:45.460
More like Dancing
With My Dud.

00:45.460 --> 00:47.040
Am I right?

00:50.290 --> 00:52.120
Hey, check out
this phone bill.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.620
For the first time ever,
we didn't go over
our family minutes.

00:56.170 --> 00:57.920
I miss Rachel.

01:00.750 --> 01:04.210
Hey, Rachel, you know the makeup
you told me not to touch?

01:06.580 --> 01:09.460
Overseas yelling.
Not the same.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.250
I never thought
I would say this,

01:11.250 --> 01:12.960
but this family
feels too small.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.460
Without Rachel here
to tell us to shut up,

01:15.460 --> 01:17.500
I feel like we have
nothing to talk about.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.540
We all miss Rachel,

01:19.540 --> 01:21.040
but we need
to stay positive.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.250
I knew the day would come

01:23.250 --> 01:24.580
when one of
my little chickadees

01:24.580 --> 01:28.000
would fly the nest,
tearing out my heart,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.540
and leaving a big,
giant hole in the family.

01:30.540 --> 01:32.620
Come on, Suzie,
you're better than this.

01:35.540 --> 01:37.380
Okay.

01:37.380 --> 01:39.540
Rachel was the oldest
and most experienced,

01:39.540 --> 01:41.460
but with her leaving
is an opportunity

01:41.460 --> 01:42.710
for the rest of you
to flourish.

01:42.710 --> 01:44.620
Oh, flourish, yes.

01:44.620 --> 01:45.960
Especially you, Georgie.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.710
Say what?

01:47.710 --> 01:50.620
You've been in Rachel's
shadow a long time.
Not anymore.

01:50.620 --> 01:54.960
Finally you get to be
captain of something--
Team Diaz.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.920
I'm gonna make you
a T-shirt.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.040
Do we still do that?
Do we still make T-shirts
for everything?

01:59.040 --> 02:01.120
This is your chance
to shine.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.040
Shine. Yes.

02:08.580 --> 02:10.790
What are you doing?

02:10.790 --> 02:12.880
Moving your bed to
where Rachel's was.

02:12.880 --> 02:16.420
You're taking on
the responsibility,
you deserve the perks.

02:16.420 --> 02:20.000
The window view,
corner all to yourself.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.500
Furthest down one
from Lewie and Beast.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.000
But I'm not ready to be
the captain of the family.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm usually the person
who sits next to the captain
and hands out water.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.080
And you do
an excellent job.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.290
No one is ever thirsty
at your games.

02:32.290 --> 02:34.500
- I take hydration
very seriously.
- Because you care.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.460
And now that you have
the chance to step up,

02:36.460 --> 02:38.420
I know you'll
shine here, too.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.620
I don't know if
you've been paying
attention all these years,

02:40.620 --> 02:42.670
but generally,
I don't shine.

02:42.670 --> 02:44.210
I crash and burn.

02:44.210 --> 02:46.000
What if I crash
and burn our family?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.210
Uh-oh.
Georgie's showing

02:48.210 --> 02:50.540
all the warning signs
of a spiral.

02:50.540 --> 02:53.580
We need someone
to pull her out fast.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.420
Hey, Rach...

02:55.420 --> 02:56.750
Oh, yeah.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.380
That's right.

02:58.380 --> 02:59.880

03:54.580 --> 03:56.250
Rachel hosed me
by leaving early.

03:56.250 --> 03:58.080
I'm used to practicing
before Coach puts me in,

03:58.080 --> 03:59.540
and he never puts me in.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.290
Oh, boy,
here comes the spiral.

04:02.290 --> 04:04.830
Oh, good idea.
Smack some sense into me.
Right here.

04:04.830 --> 04:06.540
No.
It's a massager.

04:06.540 --> 04:09.000
I was going to offer you
a calming sister massage

04:09.000 --> 04:10.580
to help you relax.

04:10.580 --> 04:14.330
Look, Rachel's just
a normal human being.

04:14.330 --> 04:16.540
She puts her pants on
one leg at a time.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.250
Except for
that weird pair of pants.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.710
Or maybe it was a skirt.

04:19.710 --> 04:21.580
Whatever it was,
she made it work.

04:21.580 --> 04:23.120
She made
a lot of things work.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.580
She told the truth
to a fault,

04:24.580 --> 04:26.580
she wasn't afraid
to stand up to Mom and Dad,

04:26.580 --> 04:29.210
and she was the one
who always got us
out of trouble.

04:29.210 --> 04:32.380
I promise, you've got
this older sibling thing,

04:32.380 --> 04:34.710
and I'm going to do
what scientists do best--

04:34.710 --> 04:36.460
prove it.

04:36.460 --> 04:38.540
I don't know
if I trust you.
This massager is terrible.

04:38.540 --> 04:41.750
Full disclosure, I originally
designed it as a pooper scooper.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.210
Eww!

04:44.670 --> 04:47.580
Feast your eyes.
The family blackmail book.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.750
For years, Rachel
used it for evil,

04:50.750 --> 04:55.000
and it's up to us
to continue that tradition.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.420
The best part is,
no one knows

04:58.420 --> 05:02.920
that this book
is completely empty.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.580
Turns out you don't
actually have to have
dirt on your family.

05:05.580 --> 05:07.460
People thinking
you have dirt

05:07.460 --> 05:08.790
is all the dirt
that you need.

05:13.710 --> 05:16.620
If it isn't
our first victim.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.830
Whatcha got there,
candy hands?

05:18.830 --> 05:20.460
Oh, this is for Chloe,

05:20.460 --> 05:22.000
that girl I've
been hanging out with.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.500
I need things to go
better than last time,

05:24.500 --> 05:26.120
when I made her cry.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.290
Well, it helps that
you set a low bar.

05:28.290 --> 05:30.040
Thank you.
I checked out her social media,

05:30.040 --> 05:32.330
and found out
this is her favorite.

05:32.330 --> 05:35.580
No wonder.
Swiss chocolate is so delicious.

05:35.580 --> 05:37.500
Now hand it over
and be on your way.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.580
- I'm not gonna give you--
- I think you are.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.830
Ethan!

05:43.830 --> 05:46.040
Have you seen
my favorite mug?

05:46.040 --> 05:48.080
Somehow,
it was less humiliating

05:48.080 --> 05:49.830
getting shaken down
by an older sister.

05:51.290 --> 05:53.380
Ugh, it's got almonds.

05:53.380 --> 05:55.670
Eh, I'll eat around them.

05:55.670 --> 05:58.330
Anybody see my spit bucket?

06:00.710 --> 06:02.210
What are we doing?

06:02.210 --> 06:04.620
Proving that you can
fill Rachel's shoes.

06:04.620 --> 06:06.040
Sure, she has some skills,

06:06.040 --> 06:07.830
but I'm confident
you have them, too.

06:07.830 --> 06:09.790
Does Mom know her bedroom
curtains are out here?

06:09.790 --> 06:11.750
Focus.
And no, she doesn't.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.120
You are about
to be confronted by

06:15.120 --> 06:17.330
a series of potential real-life
scenarios I've dubbed

06:17.330 --> 06:20.670
"WWRD-- What
Would Rachel Do?"

06:20.670 --> 06:22.710
Challenge number one...

06:24.670 --> 06:26.330
"Tough Love."

06:26.330 --> 06:27.920
Here's the scene.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.170
It's morning, and Ethan's
heading out to school.

06:30.170 --> 06:31.790
What would Rachel do?

06:38.170 --> 06:41.170
Check out the E-man.

06:41.170 --> 06:43.920
New jacket.
What do you think?

06:43.920 --> 06:45.960
It's maybe
not my favorite,

06:45.960 --> 06:47.710
but I could be wrong.

06:47.710 --> 06:49.580
I mostly wear sweats,
so what do I know?

06:49.580 --> 06:51.880
No, Georgie, you're Rachel.
Tough love.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.830
Right, sorry.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.920
I'd maybe change.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.540
I know you have
some really nice...

06:57.540 --> 06:59.540
any other jacket
but that one to wear.

06:59.540 --> 07:00.920
But I feel good.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.830
I look fly.

07:02.830 --> 07:05.210
The ladies
are gonna love it.

07:05.210 --> 07:07.000
Then again,
if it makes you happy.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.670
- Wrong answer.

07:09.670 --> 07:11.250
But I don't want him
to feel bad.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.920
That's why he needs
the Rachel-style tough love.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.790
Last time he wore
this to school,
this happened.

07:16.790 --> 07:20.420
"Loser"?
That makes two of us.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.250
Don't worry.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.670
You've still got
plenty more challenges
to redeem yourself.

07:26.460 --> 07:28.420
Do we really need
to talk through this curtain?

07:28.420 --> 07:31.380
How else am I supposed
to do a big reveal?

07:31.380 --> 07:34.580
Now, sometimes we need
to tell Mom and Dad

07:34.580 --> 07:36.790
things they don't
wanna hear.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.620
We could always
rely on Rachel for that.

07:38.620 --> 07:40.670
Challenge number two...

07:41.790 --> 07:43.250
"Truth To Power."

07:43.250 --> 07:44.790
Here's the scene.

07:44.790 --> 07:47.170
Mom served tuna casserole
three nights in a row,

07:47.170 --> 07:49.790
and she's pulling
a fourth one out of the freezer.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.710
What would Rachel do?

07:55.710 --> 07:58.920
Hey, kids, you know what
I've got a hankering for?

07:58.920 --> 08:01.790
Tuna casserole.

08:01.790 --> 08:03.250
Oh, look, I've
got one right here.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.920
Mom, I'm really sorry, but--

08:04.920 --> 08:07.000
Rachel doesn't say
sorry, Rachel.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.960
I'm not sorry, but
we've already had it

08:08.960 --> 08:10.830
a bunch of times
this week, and honestly,
no one really likes--

08:10.830 --> 08:13.460
- This isn't a restaurant.
- I know, but it's the fourth--

08:13.460 --> 08:15.710
Do you know how
exhausted I am?

08:15.710 --> 08:18.290
I am a busy mom
with seven kids.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.290
Oh, here, let me
take that from you.

08:20.290 --> 08:21.580
I'll go put it
in the oven.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.580
!

08:25.830 --> 08:28.250
The possibilities of
this book are endless,

08:28.250 --> 08:30.670
and we've barely
tapped into its potential.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.290
Before we're done,
we're going to have

08:32.290 --> 08:33.790
all of Harley's inventions.

08:33.790 --> 08:36.460
All of Georgie's
participation trophies.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.170
And all of Ethan's...

08:38.170 --> 08:39.790
Well, Ethan
doesn't have much,

08:39.790 --> 08:42.120
but whatever he has,
we're taking it.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.920
Hey, lover boy.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.420
How much money are you
bringing on your date?

08:47.420 --> 08:50.330
However much it is,
it's gonna be 20 bucks less.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.000
You guys are killing me.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.580
You take my chocolate,
my money.

08:54.580 --> 08:56.710
I guess I'm gonna
have to rely on my charm.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.380
I wouldn't
recommend it.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.750
I'll figure out a way
to end this.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.710
I'm smarter than
you dummies.

09:05.710 --> 09:09.250
You're the one who's
afraid of an empty book.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.920
Who's the dummy now?

09:12.670 --> 09:14.460
Blank?

09:14.460 --> 09:17.920
I can't believe I fell for it
all these years.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.880
I'm calling Rachel.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.460
She owes me, like, $900,

09:21.460 --> 09:23.500
and at least 12 hours
with the remote.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.790
Beast!!

09:26.790 --> 09:30.790
Fine. I'll share some of
the almonds from my spit bucket.

09:33.790 --> 09:36.750
The final challenge
tests the Rachel skill
you'll need the most.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.000
Hogging the shower?
Dating dangerous boys?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.670
Both good guesses,
but no.

09:40.670 --> 09:44.920
We're a family that does a lot
of stuff we're not supposed to,

09:44.920 --> 09:47.460
and Rachel could
always get us out of it.

09:47.460 --> 09:49.920
The final challenge...
"Think Fast."

09:50.960 --> 09:52.790
Here's the scene.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.380
Mom went to the store
and left us

09:54.380 --> 09:56.330
in charge of
Lewie and Beast,

09:56.330 --> 09:58.330
but you come downstairs
and find this.

09:58.330 --> 10:00.880
What would Rachel do?

10:02.500 --> 10:04.040
What's going on
back there?

10:04.040 --> 10:06.080
Just need a minute.

10:12.920 --> 10:16.330
Before you get mad,
hear us out.

10:16.330 --> 10:18.750
I get that you're Lewie,
but why are you green?

10:21.960 --> 10:25.290
How else are we gonna
sneak up on frogs?

10:25.290 --> 10:28.460
Mom told us we could
all go to the movies tonight,

10:28.460 --> 10:31.620
but not if she comes
home to find this.
What are you gonna do?

10:31.620 --> 10:33.620
- Uh...
- Mom's coming
up the stairs.

10:33.620 --> 10:34.920
Come on, you can do this.
Think fast.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.330
Nice hustle.
Have a sip of water.

10:36.330 --> 10:39.000
- My comfort zone.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.250
Cut me some slack.
I'm out of my element,

10:41.250 --> 10:42.960
although hydration
is very important.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.040
- I got it.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.960
Sorry.
A marathon shower.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.750
The paint can said
kid friendly.

10:55.750 --> 10:58.330
Only if the kid wants
to be green for two weeks.

10:58.330 --> 11:00.880
Well, kudos to you on
your science experiment.

11:00.880 --> 11:03.380
You proved I'm a disaster
as Diaz team captain.

11:03.380 --> 11:05.170
Those exercises
weren't easy.

11:05.170 --> 11:07.210
And maybe you
didn't kill it
on all of them--

11:07.210 --> 11:09.290
- Any of them.
- Any of them.

11:09.290 --> 11:12.500
But it's crazy to think you
could suddenly become Rachel.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.960
It took her 18 years.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.000
- You just need to practice.
- Hey, guys.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.500
You know that girl
I've been hanging out with?

11:20.500 --> 11:23.290
Chloe? I'm not sure
what's going on with her.

11:23.290 --> 11:25.620
Sounds like you
have a problem,

11:25.620 --> 11:29.750
and look, here's
someone who can help.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.420
I don't know. Relationships
are more Rachel's thing.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.040
It's the middle of
the night in Paris.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.040
You could call her
in the morning.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.500
Seems like
a long time to wait.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.710
Maybe someone else
can figure out

11:39.710 --> 11:42.750
what would Rachel do.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.500
Lay it on me.

11:44.500 --> 11:49.540
Okay, so I brought Chloe
a thoughtful gift from
our kitchen.

11:49.540 --> 11:51.920
I brought you something.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.750
A box of crackers.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.210
Yeah, I didn't know
what kind would be
your favorite,

11:57.210 --> 11:59.620
so I got you assorted.

11:59.620 --> 12:01.290
Oh.

12:01.290 --> 12:03.000
That's...

12:03.000 --> 12:05.170
uh...

12:05.170 --> 12:07.000
uh....

12:07.000 --> 12:08.920
That's... what?

12:08.920 --> 12:10.620
Who knows?

12:10.620 --> 12:12.420
She trailed off
before she finished.

12:12.420 --> 12:14.040
She does it all the time.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.920
Check it. I scored us tickets
to the Jam Slam Seven.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.040
Boy...

12:19.040 --> 12:20.500
sometimes you're just...

12:22.880 --> 12:23.920
so...

12:23.920 --> 12:25.670
uh...

12:25.670 --> 12:28.040
You're, uh...

12:28.040 --> 12:30.170
Does she love me,
does she hate me?

12:30.170 --> 12:32.210
Nobody knows,
because the girl

12:32.210 --> 12:33.830
doesn't finish
her sentences.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.120
Obviously, we all know
what's going on.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.790
She trails off because she's
thinking something not nice,

12:40.790 --> 12:42.750
and doesn't wanna say it.

12:42.750 --> 12:45.040
Finding that out
is gonna be crushing.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.210
Glad I'm not Georgie.

12:47.210 --> 12:49.830
Time for some tough love
like we practiced.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.380
What would Rachel do?

12:53.040 --> 12:54.670
She's, uh...

12:56.250 --> 12:58.250
Your jacket's butt ugly,
tuna casserole stinks,

12:58.250 --> 13:01.170
we're going to the movies,
green paint or not.

13:01.170 --> 13:02.380
What?!

13:02.380 --> 13:04.710
How about
some water, champ?

13:04.710 --> 13:07.000
Sorry.

13:09.290 --> 13:10.540
Okay, Rachel will be up
in six hours.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.290
Who wants cocoa?

13:12.290 --> 13:14.580
So we're gonna pretend
that didn't just happen?

13:14.580 --> 13:16.540
I think it's for the best.

13:16.540 --> 13:18.420
You're a girl.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.080
What do you think's
going on with Chloe?

13:22.420 --> 13:24.710
I...

13:24.710 --> 13:26.250
Let's see.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.420
Um...

13:30.290 --> 13:32.080
Oh, no,
it's spreading.

13:34.290 --> 13:36.540
Now I understand
Georgie's flip-out.

13:36.540 --> 13:38.290
Tough love
is harder than it looks.

13:38.290 --> 13:40.540
Think, Harley.
What would Rachel do?

13:41.710 --> 13:43.460
What would Rachel do?

13:43.460 --> 13:45.330
Wake up and smell the shame.

13:45.330 --> 13:47.170
Chloe's not finishing
her sentences,

13:47.170 --> 13:49.290
because if she did,
they would destroy you.

13:49.290 --> 13:51.710
What you're missing
is a straight-up dissing.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.290
Uh-oh.
Look at his face.

13:56.290 --> 13:58.250
I went too far.
I out-Racheled Rachel.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.750
Should I give him a hug?

13:59.750 --> 14:01.330
I feel like I should
give him a hug.

14:01.330 --> 14:03.790
I'm gonna give him
a hug.

14:03.790 --> 14:05.920
You're absolutely right.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.620
I am?

14:07.620 --> 14:09.710
Thanks, Harls.

14:09.710 --> 14:12.330
It's nice to have
some truth bombs
back in the family.

14:12.330 --> 14:14.210
That's me,
the truth bomber.

14:15.790 --> 14:17.880
She hates you.
Glad I could help.

14:22.750 --> 14:26.000
Now that we've had
our invisible tea,
let's talk business.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
We've got a problem,
and his name is Beast.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.580
His yapping about
the blackmail book

14:30.580 --> 14:33.250
took the only power we've
ever had in this family.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.040
He's a loose cannon.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.710
What's to say he won't
tank our next scheme?

14:39.380 --> 14:41.790
True, but I love the kid.

14:41.790 --> 14:43.790
We go back a long way.

14:43.790 --> 14:45.290
Almost since birth.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.000
So what do we do?

14:50.790 --> 14:53.040
Move over.
We've got issues.

14:53.040 --> 14:56.170
- A conundrum.

14:56.170 --> 14:58.540
You know who's great
with conundrums? Georgie.

14:58.540 --> 15:01.380
Well, you're older than us,
and you're here.

15:01.380 --> 15:03.120
I'm older than you,
I'm here.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.420
Yeah, so's the lamp.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.210
Anyways, here's
the thing.

15:06.210 --> 15:07.500
Hey, guys,
what's going on?

15:09.290 --> 15:10.500
Just chatting.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.420
We have a...

15:12.420 --> 15:14.000
three-legged stool,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.500
and one of the legs
is a great leg,

15:17.500 --> 15:21.250
but it's really wobbly.

15:21.250 --> 15:24.290
Totally collapses under
the least bit of pressure,

15:24.290 --> 15:27.920
which makes it impossible
for the other two legs
to do their thing.

15:27.920 --> 15:32.250
Glad you guys have
taken an interest in furniture.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.210
Uh, thinking fast
like an older sibling does

15:34.210 --> 15:37.080
when they're
solving problems.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.250
I say yank
the weak leg off.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.460
And so it shall be done.

15:41.460 --> 15:43.460
Can I be the one
that yanks the leg off?

15:43.460 --> 15:45.420
You'll definitely
be involved.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.670
Now, how about nobody
asks any more questions,

15:47.670 --> 15:51.080
and we leave all the drama
to the Shouty Housewives
of New England?

15:51.080 --> 15:52.460
Cool.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.710
This is nice sitting
here as a family,

15:56.710 --> 16:00.000
- watching angry women
throw chairs.

16:04.250 --> 16:07.460
Aww, look at that.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.330
I was worried
when Rachel left,

16:09.330 --> 16:12.120
it would be chaos,
but they're having
so much fun.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.710
I don't know
how you did it.

16:13.710 --> 16:16.170
Actually, I didn't.

16:16.170 --> 16:19.250
You're also more modest
than our last Diaz team captain.

16:19.250 --> 16:22.750
Tonight, the biggest piece
of tuna casserole goes to you.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.500
Oh, boy, did I dodge
some bullets for you.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.250
All that Chloe stuff,

16:40.250 --> 16:41.920
and some weird questions
about furniture.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.420
Somehow, I got through.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.250
Of course you did.

16:45.250 --> 16:47.500
You're Harley.
That's what you do.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.540
The words you're
saying are nice,

16:50.540 --> 16:53.290
but the way you're
saying them is...

16:53.290 --> 16:55.500
Hey, why is my bed
in Rachel's spot?

16:55.500 --> 16:57.500
That figures, since you're
so good at being Rachel,

16:57.500 --> 16:59.250
you should probably
sleep where she does.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.750
Okay, that's
definitely a dig.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.330
Quick refresh,
you bailed,

17:02.330 --> 17:04.790
and understudy Rachel
had to go on.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.790
And no surprise,

17:06.790 --> 17:09.920
acting like Rachel
came naturally for you,
just like everything else.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.420
But I can't do it,
no matter how hard I try.

17:12.420 --> 17:14.380
That's not true.
I'll prove it.

17:14.380 --> 17:17.210
I still have a Daphne outfit
I never used in the challenges.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.960
It was a little tight,
but I can squeeze in.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.460
Stop. Stop telling me
I can do things.

17:21.460 --> 17:23.250
You just set me up
for a bigger fail,

17:23.250 --> 17:25.330
which is odd, because
misplaced confidence,

17:25.330 --> 17:27.040
that's my thing.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.540
Thanks for making
time to see us.

17:33.540 --> 17:35.250
What do you mean,
making time?

17:35.250 --> 17:36.330
It's my fort, too.

17:36.330 --> 17:38.000
Yeah, about that.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.580
We've come up with
a new scam,

17:40.580 --> 17:44.580
and it's really
a two-person job.

17:44.580 --> 17:46.330
When it comes to our criminal
enterprise moving forward,

17:46.330 --> 17:47.960
we're making a change.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.170
Think of this as
an opportunity

17:50.170 --> 17:51.380
to take some time.

17:51.380 --> 17:53.170
Pursue your own dreams.

17:53.170 --> 17:55.420
Ask yourself,
what does Beast want?

17:55.420 --> 17:56.580
Is this about the stool?

17:56.580 --> 17:58.000
We're saying you're fired.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.460
We had no choice.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.250
You told Ethan there was
nothing in the blackmail book.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.250
I make one mistake.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.710
We have a list.
Don't make this more difficult.

18:06.710 --> 18:09.000
Here are your
personal effects.

18:10.670 --> 18:12.460
Security will
show you out.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.460
I feel terrible,

18:16.460 --> 18:18.290
but all I did was what
I told Georgie to do.

18:18.290 --> 18:20.540
Act like Rachel.

18:20.540 --> 18:22.580
Is it my fault
it went well?

18:22.580 --> 18:24.170
That junk advice
you sold me.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.460
Your...

18:26.460 --> 18:28.500
truth bombs about
how Chloe hates me.

18:28.500 --> 18:31.000
It sure didn't
seem that way.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.460
Look, I'm really sorry,
but clearly, this isn't
working out.

18:35.460 --> 18:38.420
Wait, are you...

18:38.420 --> 18:40.500
I can fill in the blanks.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.250
It's obvious we shouldn't
be together.

18:42.250 --> 18:45.210
I... I can't
believe you're...

18:45.210 --> 18:48.580
This has never
happened to...

18:48.580 --> 18:52.620
How am I gonna
tell my...

18:56.830 --> 19:00.040
And then she cried for,
like, 20 minutes.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.420
Your bad advice made me
break up with a nice girl

19:02.420 --> 19:06.080
who... who...
I can't even finish
the sentence.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.210
Hey, this is my first go
as an older sibling stand-in.

19:09.210 --> 19:10.880
I was bound to get
one wrong.

19:12.290 --> 19:15.540
Turns out we should've
asked the lamp for advice.

19:15.540 --> 19:16.920
Now that we've
dropped the dead weight,

19:16.920 --> 19:19.500
let's talk schemes.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.620
I've got one.
I call it ghost janitors.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.540
We convince everybody
that the house is haunted.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.170
Then we get them
to hire us

19:28.170 --> 19:31.460
to sweep out
the ghouls, the monsters,
the bats, et cetera.

19:31.460 --> 19:34.290
Good. We got a bad idea
out of the way.

19:34.290 --> 19:36.540
I say we steal things
from the kitchen,

19:36.540 --> 19:38.750
then make Mom and Dad
pay to get them back.

19:38.750 --> 19:41.750
Let's start with
a high-ticket item.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.750
The good fork.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.670
That makes no sense.
Most of us eat with our hands.

19:50.670 --> 19:52.670
I say let's vote.
Ghost janitors.

19:52.670 --> 19:54.500
Kitchen kidnapping.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.710
Mmm, another tie.

19:56.710 --> 19:59.880
We can't get a decent
easy-money scheme going

19:59.880 --> 20:02.620
since you made us
dump Beast.

20:02.620 --> 20:04.670
You told them
to dump Beast?

20:04.670 --> 20:06.880
I thought we were talking
about a stool.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.620
It's called a metaphor.

20:08.620 --> 20:11.080
I thought you were
the smart one in the family.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.750
Hee-ya!

20:12.750 --> 20:16.540
Lewie, Daphne,
mind explaining

20:16.540 --> 20:18.960
why Beast got fired
from playing with you,

20:18.960 --> 20:22.620
and the only thing that makes
him feel better is a Dad pony?

20:22.620 --> 20:25.540
Harley? They do something
to upset you?

20:25.540 --> 20:27.290
I was just trying
to help.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.120
I'm not ready
to be the oldest kid.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.710
I was supposed to have
three more years.

20:30.710 --> 20:33.750
Hey, leave her alone.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.170
She's doing her best...

20:36.170 --> 20:39.080
as Harley,
Harley trying to be Rachel.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.920
Which is hard,
because she's Harley,

20:40.920 --> 20:43.250
which she is very
good at, by the way.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.540
- I have been lost

20:45.540 --> 20:48.330
since Beast started
feeding you sugar cubes.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.710
You two are fighting because
you're a two-legged stool.

20:50.710 --> 20:54.540
You got rid of the leg
that keeps you balanced
and breaks the ties.

20:54.540 --> 20:56.330
Beast may blow a scheme
here and there,

20:56.330 --> 20:58.250
but without him,
there's no scheming at all.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.000
Uh, I'm still down a girl
who's into me.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.330
I repeat, into me.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.710
I'm sure.

21:06.710 --> 21:08.540
I know when I pause
in a sentence,

21:08.540 --> 21:10.710
it's because I like
the person so much,

21:10.710 --> 21:12.750
I can't find
the right words.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.170
If you explain your confusion,
I bet she'll take you back.

21:15.170 --> 21:17.000
I mean, she did stay
with you after the crackers.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.040
Why didn't you say
that the first time
I asked?

21:21.790 --> 21:25.000
I guess because I was
tough-loving like Rachel,
and not thinking like me.

21:26.580 --> 21:30.000
Would you take us back
if we un

21:30.000 --> 21:32.540
Sure. This lazy horse
won't even jump a fence.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.880
He tried.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.920
Which is why he will
be in the pasture

21:41.920 --> 21:43.580
with an ice pack.

21:45.620 --> 21:49.170
Look at you, seizing
the opportunity to step up.

21:49.170 --> 21:50.790
I knew you'd shine.

21:52.290 --> 21:54.750
Thanks, but I didn't
shine alone.

21:59.250 --> 22:02.580
You know you just did
something Rachel does
all the time.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.210
You stood up for me.

22:04.210 --> 22:06.460
Because you
stepped up for me.

22:08.290 --> 22:10.170
Georgie and I
can't fill the hole

22:10.170 --> 22:12.000
that Rachel left
by ourselves...

22:19.000 --> 22:21.580
So what's our plan?
Kidnapping silverware,

22:21.580 --> 22:23.250
or Lewie's dumb idea?

22:23.250 --> 22:25.210
It's called ghost janitors,

22:25.210 --> 22:27.460
and you should be proud
to wear the uniform.

22:27.460 --> 22:29.790
Everybody will
have to try.

22:29.790 --> 22:32.580
I'm thinking of a number
between one and ten.

22:32.580 --> 22:34.620
Closest one wins.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.500
- Four.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.040
It was nine.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.080
Uh!

22:39.080 --> 22:40.620
The good fork!

22:43.960 --> 22:46.500
So it was kind of
a misunderstanding,

22:46.500 --> 22:51.040
and I'm really hoping
we can go out again.

22:51.040 --> 22:54.380
Well, I'd, uh...

22:54.380 --> 22:56.670
- Uh...

22:56.670 --> 22:58.380
Yes!

22:58.380 --> 23:00.210
And the best way
to shine

23:00.210 --> 23:02.380
- is by being ourselves.
- Yes!

23:03.710 --> 23:05.460
Not that I don't
miss Rachel,

23:05.460 --> 23:08.290
but it's nice having
a break from her attitude.

23:08.290 --> 23:10.290
Oh, yeah, I could
totally use a break.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.330
Trying to play lacrosse here.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.040
- Gonna need that ball back.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.460
Your new neighbor Aiden.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.170
The one who just
asked for his ball back.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.830
How's that comin',
by the way?

23:27.710 --> 23:29.380
That break may be
shorter than we thought.
