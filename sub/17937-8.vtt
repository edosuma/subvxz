WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:07.530
Me again. Your party's still
going strong. Call me back, yeah?

00:07.580 --> 00:10.090
Or better still, get down here.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.530
Hey, hey! Where're you going?! Uh?

00:12.580 --> 00:14.450
The night is young!

00:15.660 --> 00:18.170
All right. All right, well, maybe not,

00:18.220 --> 00:21.490
but I say... I say we push on through!

00:21.540 --> 00:24.730
Lightweights!

00:24.780 --> 00:27.930
'It's the undisputable
sound of summer '94.

00:27.980 --> 00:30.570
It's the lead single from
their new album Parklife.

00:30.620 --> 00:33.220
'Here's Blur with Girls And Boys.'

00:34.060 --> 00:38.050
Oh. Just you and me left, sweetheart.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.210
How about another drink?

00:41.260 --> 00:43.330
I've got to go.

00:43.380 --> 00:45.410
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:45.460 --> 00:49.810
Don't I even get one last goodnight kiss?

00:49.860 --> 00:51.820
I don't feel well.

00:53.580 --> 00:55.210
Give that back!

00:55.260 --> 00:56.970
You're stealing from me?

00:57.020 --> 00:58.890
So? It's not like you need it!

00:58.940 --> 01:00.730
- Give it back!
- I don't think so.

01:00.780 --> 01:02.650
Maybe I should call the police?

01:02.700 --> 01:04.370
No, no -- just...

01:04.420 --> 01:06.500
Arrrgh!

01:11.580 --> 01:15.130
I'm sorry, sweetheart. Mm?

01:15.180 --> 01:17.650
Look, look, I didn't mean to...

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

01:45.980 --> 01:48.410
Oh! Well, that was a waste of time!

01:48.460 --> 01:51.610
Rebecca Henson, the woman,
she left that message?

01:51.660 --> 01:54.690
Yeah, sorry. My head's in this Army case.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.850
- So?
- Refused to speak to me.

01:56.900 --> 02:00.450
Thinks her information is
"for the coroner's ears only."

02:00.500 --> 02:03.130
- Did she say what it was
about, at least? - Nope.

02:03.180 --> 02:05.570
Well, if she's that desperate
to see me, she can come here.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.370
I told her that, but she says
she can't leave her house.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.930
Maybe she's agoraphobic.

02:09.979 --> 02:11.610
As if I don't have enough to do!

02:11.660 --> 02:12.850
It's not my fault.

02:12.900 --> 02:18.050
I told her I was the coroner's officer but it's
like she's got no faith in my professionalism.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.040
I can't imagine why.

02:40.940 --> 02:43.940
Mrs Henson? It's Jane
Kennedy, the coroner.

02:50.780 --> 02:52.420
Mrs Henson?

03:06.180 --> 03:07.850
Er, no, thanks.

03:09.060 --> 03:12.660
So, Mrs Henson, you said
you have some information?

03:14.780 --> 03:17.120
I'm afraid I don't have long.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.530
Do you remember the Foxby affair?

03:21.580 --> 03:22.730
Yes.

03:22.780 --> 03:24.730
Professionally speaking
it was before my time,

03:24.780 --> 03:26.920
but I know what happened.

03:29.060 --> 03:31.540
Do you now? Go on, then.

03:33.100 --> 03:37.370
The Earl of Solberry, known as
Jerry Foxby to his friends --

03:37.420 --> 03:39.410
rich, handsome, party animal --

03:39.460 --> 03:40.890
makes a 999 call from his yacht

03:40.940 --> 03:43.130
claiming he thinks he's
killed a prostitute.

03:43.180 --> 03:44.290
Escort.

03:44.340 --> 03:47.210
He hangs up and disappears
off the face of the Earth.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.770
What do you think happened to him?

03:48.820 --> 03:50.290
Consensus is he killed himself.

03:50.340 --> 03:52.090
I asked what you think.

03:52.140 --> 03:54.170
I don't know. His body was never found.

03:54.220 --> 03:56.690
Neither was the... escort's.

03:56.740 --> 03:59.410
This was over 20 years ago. Why now?

04:05.100 --> 04:07.170
Oliver Foxby. That's...?

04:07.220 --> 04:08.810
Jerry's younger brother.

04:08.860 --> 04:11.650
He's applying for court recognition
of his brother's death.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.170
He wants Jerry's title.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.290
So?

04:14.340 --> 04:17.450
Let's say it jogged my memory.

04:17.500 --> 04:21.740
See, I know what really
happened on the yacht that night.

04:23.660 --> 04:26.890
How? The police spent years investigating.

04:26.940 --> 04:29.080
They never got anywhere.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.740
The years haven't exactly
been kind, I know.

04:55.740 --> 04:57.850
You're...?

04:57.900 --> 05:00.410
I don't want money or nothing.

05:00.460 --> 05:04.490
I just... want people to know the truth.

05:04.540 --> 05:07.410
Why don't I read up on
the history of the case?

05:07.460 --> 05:11.650
I can come back tomorrow morning and we
can go through your version of events?

05:11.700 --> 05:14.610
S'pose I've waited this long.

05:14.660 --> 05:17.330
Would you mind if I took that photo?

05:20.260 --> 05:21.530
Thanks.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.580
I'll see you tomorrow.

06:04.260 --> 06:07.060
Excuse me. Is Oliver Foxby at home?

06:12.780 --> 06:14.570
Journalist?

06:14.620 --> 06:16.770
Local coroner. Jane Kennedy.

06:16.820 --> 06:21.700
Auntie Peggy! This one's
here to see Mr Foxby.

06:24.220 --> 06:26.420
You'd better come through.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.970
Excuse the mess.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.290
Is Mr Foxby having a clear-out?

06:33.340 --> 06:36.850
This all belonged to the
Countess, his mother.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.970
She passed a couple of months back.

06:39.020 --> 06:42.650
May I ask your business with His Lordship?

06:42.700 --> 06:46.650
I'd like to discuss with him the application
for his brother's death certificate.

06:46.700 --> 06:49.250
Oh. About time it was all sorted.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.730
Sorry, you called him "His Lordship"?

06:51.780 --> 06:54.770
Mr Foxby hasn't inherited
his brother's title yet.

06:54.820 --> 06:57.010
It's only a matter of time.

06:57.060 --> 07:01.650
Behind closed doors, he's considered
himself the lord for years.

07:01.700 --> 07:05.770
Were you here when Jerry disappeared?

07:05.820 --> 07:09.450
I've been here since Jerry was in nappies.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.970
I was nanny to the boys
before I became housekeeper.

07:13.020 --> 07:16.650
And before you ask, no, I don't
know what happened to him.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.290
Some people believe he went abroad.

07:19.340 --> 07:24.660
Jerry was like a son to me, but
he had the devil in him, too.

07:26.140 --> 07:30.460
Wherever he is, I only
hope he's finally at peace.

07:31.980 --> 07:35.090
Well, you can wait in the morning room.

07:35.140 --> 07:37.330
I'll see if he's free.

07:37.380 --> 07:38.890
Thank you.

07:38.940 --> 07:41.810
I was under the impression that
the death certificate was now

07:41.860 --> 07:43.330
a matter for the High Court.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.770
Well, the case involves an
unexplained death on my patch.

07:46.820 --> 07:49.490
I may be asked to supply
relevant material.

07:49.540 --> 07:51.250
So, how can we help?

07:51.300 --> 07:55.970
I was just wondering why you haven't
applied for the certificate before now?

07:56.020 --> 07:58.210
Mother wouldn't allow it.

07:58.260 --> 08:02.220
I understand she passed away
recently. I'm sorry for your loss.

08:03.300 --> 08:08.180
My mother refused to accept Jerry's death
unless she could see his body for herself.

08:09.660 --> 08:11.730
I am more prepared to act on faith.

08:11.780 --> 08:14.930
And, presumably, a death certificate
would clear the way for you

08:14.980 --> 08:18.130
to claim the family title and
your place in the House of Lords?

08:18.180 --> 08:20.370
It doesn't work quite like that.

08:20.420 --> 08:24.370
Hereditary peers don't just
stroll into Westminster nowadays.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.490
Oliver already has a distinguished career.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.210
Yes, the Home Office, I believe?

08:30.260 --> 08:31.890
It's where we met.

08:31.940 --> 08:33.890
Thank you.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.010
The thing is, someone's come forward

08:36.059 --> 08:39.360
claiming they have new
information about Jerry.

08:41.299 --> 08:43.690
You must forgive us.

08:43.740 --> 08:47.450
We've heard every ridiculous
conspiracy theory going.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.970
Believe me, Jerry killed the girl,

08:50.020 --> 08:53.010
threw her body overboard
and jumped in after her.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.170
And you're certain of that?

08:55.220 --> 08:57.410
Well, I suppose he might have fallen in.

08:57.460 --> 09:02.010
He was always so drunk it's possible
he didn't intend to kill himself.

09:02.060 --> 09:05.170
Either way, the only way I'd
believe Jerry is still alive

09:05.220 --> 09:08.730
is if he walked in here and
poured himself a drink.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.780
What if she walked in?

09:14.380 --> 09:15.730
Work meeting, is it?

09:15.780 --> 09:18.250
Yes, as it happens. I need to
pick his brains about a case.

09:18.300 --> 09:21.450
No, no, no, it's all right, I'll
pick something up on the way home.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.210
It's fine.

09:23.260 --> 09:26.450
All right, then. Got to go. Bye. Bye.

09:26.500 --> 09:30.210
Sorry. That was Annette wanting
to know what time I'll be back.

09:30.260 --> 09:34.530
So, come on, then, what's this new lead
you've got on this mysterious case?

09:34.580 --> 09:36.770
The Foxby affair.

09:36.820 --> 09:39.420
Why does everyone keep doing that?

09:40.900 --> 09:44.050
We've got a filing cabinet
at the station, right,

09:44.100 --> 09:47.890
a whole cabinet, full of possible
sightings of Jerry Foxby.

09:49.740 --> 09:53.370
- Mick! - Yeah? - Have you
seen Jerry Foxby recently?

09:53.420 --> 09:55.650
Yeah, course I have. He was in last week.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.330
Yeah, playing a round of
darts with Elvis Presley.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.980
Jane reckons she's got a new lead.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.650
All right, there's no need to take the...

10:03.700 --> 10:05.730
- Mick knows all about it,
don't you, Mick? - Oh, yeah.

10:05.780 --> 10:08.570
Well, he didn't throw himself in
the water, I'll tell you that much.

10:08.620 --> 10:10.210
His body would've washed up somewhere.

10:10.260 --> 10:11.850
I was on the lifeboat, remember?

10:11.900 --> 10:13.770
Like you'll ever let us forget. So?

10:13.820 --> 10:16.090
Well, he was murdered.

10:16.140 --> 10:17.690
And you know this because?

10:17.740 --> 10:21.490
Well, rumour has it he'd just had a
big win at a high-stakes poker game,

10:21.540 --> 10:22.730
hence the party.

10:22.780 --> 10:25.050
Walked out of there with 200 large,

10:25.100 --> 10:27.890
but the money was never found,
not on the yacht or at the house.

10:27.940 --> 10:30.690
I reckon his gambling buddies bumped
him off to get their money back.

10:30.740 --> 10:32.290
And what about the girl?

10:32.340 --> 10:34.010
Well, collateral damage, isn't it?

10:34.060 --> 10:37.810
I say he went abroad.
Living like a king in Rio.

10:37.860 --> 10:41.610
An army of policemen and
every reporter in the country

10:41.660 --> 10:43.290
investigated it for years.

10:43.340 --> 10:46.450
You clever girl. What do
you have that they didn't?

10:46.500 --> 10:48.170
An eye-witness.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.730
Come on!

10:51.780 --> 10:53.660
Come on!

11:02.900 --> 11:04.370
How did you talk me into this?

11:04.420 --> 11:06.170
Beer. Lots of beer.

11:06.220 --> 11:11.610
Yeah, that was it. So,
why do you want me there?

11:11.660 --> 11:15.010
Because I think she's going
to confess to killing him.

11:15.060 --> 11:16.730
She's either lying or deluded.

11:16.780 --> 11:18.770
Still, we should hear her out.

11:18.820 --> 11:20.330
Besides, what've you got to lose?

11:20.380 --> 11:21.810
If it really is Helen Boyd,

11:21.860 --> 11:23.250
you can go down in history

11:23.300 --> 11:25.650
as the copper who finally
cracked the Foxby mystery.

11:25.700 --> 11:29.860
Yeah, well, beats doing
paperwork, I suppose.

11:33.100 --> 11:39.010
Look, she's a bit strange, so just hold back
until I know she's all right with you being here.

11:39.060 --> 11:43.100
Mrs Henson? It's Jane
Kennedy -- we met yesterday.

11:48.460 --> 11:49.810
Where are you going?

11:49.860 --> 11:50.930
She's not in.

11:50.980 --> 11:52.570
Davey, she's just... Davey.

11:52.620 --> 11:55.020
All right -- let's have a look.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.970
Let's have a look.

11:59.140 --> 12:00.680
Mrs Henson!

12:11.340 --> 12:13.680
So much for your eye-witness.

12:18.580 --> 12:20.690
We don't even know if that was Helen Boyd.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.650
According to that woman's passport,
her name is Rebecca Henson.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.810
Why would she lie about being a
woman everyone thought was dead?

12:26.860 --> 12:31.290
Because she was obsessed with
Jerry Foxby. You saw the scrapbook.

12:31.340 --> 12:33.650
What if she really was Helen Boyd

12:33.700 --> 12:36.690
and somebody didn't want
her spilling the beans?

12:36.740 --> 12:39.690
I say she killed herself. A hoax.

12:39.740 --> 12:43.370
Her way of sticking up two
fingers before she killed herself.

12:43.420 --> 12:46.730
By contacting you she made sure
someone would find her body.

12:46.780 --> 12:47.850
I'm not sure.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.850
Well, as much as your input's
always appreciated...

12:50.900 --> 12:52.130
You're telling me to butt out?

12:52.180 --> 12:55.130
Yeah, it is a police
matter. For now, at least.

12:55.180 --> 12:57.490
- All right, I'll take a
back-seat on Helen Boyd. - Good.

12:57.540 --> 13:00.450
- On one condition.
- Ah! Here we go.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.250
I get to see all the police files
on Jerry Foxby's disappearance.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.170
You just can't help yourself, can you?

13:05.220 --> 13:06.370
It's why you love me.

13:06.420 --> 13:08.090
Yeah, must be.

13:09.780 --> 13:10.970
Right, I've got to get on.

13:11.020 --> 13:12.220
Yeah.

13:15.460 --> 13:16.810
What?!

13:16.860 --> 13:18.250
Start reading.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.490
I want a list for any alleged
sightings of Helen Boyd

13:20.540 --> 13:23.530
- or Jerry Foxby since they disappeared.
- That'll take days!

13:23.580 --> 13:27.850
Not if you work quickly and once
you've finished, go online -- I
want conspiracy theories, rumours,

13:27.900 --> 13:29.530
anything to do with the Foxby affair.

13:29.580 --> 13:32.170
As long as they don't mention
alien abductions, write it down.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.250
Why am I doing this? We
don't even have a body.

13:34.300 --> 13:37.410
Because if we find out what happened
to Jerry Foxby, I bet you a fiver

13:37.460 --> 13:40.460
we'll find out what
happened to Helen Boyd.

13:59.860 --> 14:02.050
- Mrs Boyd?
- Yeah?

14:02.100 --> 14:05.050
- I'm DS Higgins, South
Dart police. - Hm-mm?

14:05.100 --> 14:08.820
- I was wondering if I could have a
word with you about your niece. - OK.

14:24.420 --> 14:26.770
I didn't think we'd be
seeing you here again.

14:26.820 --> 14:28.250
What makes you say that?

14:28.300 --> 14:30.650
His Lordship don't like
people snooping around.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.490
Normally he sends them packing.

14:32.540 --> 14:34.090
I'm not snooping. I just...

14:34.140 --> 14:36.450
Just want to know what happened to Jerry.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.330
Yes. Do you know anything?

14:38.380 --> 14:41.100
No. Before my time.

14:42.340 --> 14:46.740
I've only been here since the old
groundsman retired a few years back.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.370
Are you all right?

14:51.100 --> 14:56.610
Yeah. Old knee's playing up,
that's all. Occupational hazard.

14:56.660 --> 15:00.490
So, your predecessor,
does he still live nearby?

15:00.540 --> 15:05.330
You could say that. He's buried
in St Bernadette's Churchyard.

15:05.380 --> 15:08.730
Any other staff members
around from that time?

15:08.780 --> 15:13.810
No. Only Auntie Peggy. She got me the job.

15:13.860 --> 15:16.290
Oh, here y'are, speak of the devil.

15:16.340 --> 15:18.610
His Lordship's not at home.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.610
Oh, well, his car's here.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.530
Peggy!

15:23.580 --> 15:26.050
That's to say he's unavailable.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.290
You were Jerry's nanny.

15:29.340 --> 15:33.170
The last thing we need is
you reopening old wounds!

15:33.220 --> 15:37.300
I understand how you feel, but
circumstances have changed.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.940
Peggy! At last! I...

15:46.820 --> 15:49.690
I thought we answered all
your questions yesterday?

15:49.740 --> 15:52.610
I'd just like to confirm a few details.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.810
- Such as? - I was reading
through the witness statements.

15:55.860 --> 15:57.370
Some of the guests on the yacht

15:57.420 --> 16:00.330
claimed that Jerry had just won a
lot of money at cards. Is that true?

16:00.380 --> 16:03.810
Possibly. Gambling was
one of Jerry's many sins.

16:03.860 --> 16:07.370
That said, there was no money
found and I wouldn't consider

16:07.420 --> 16:09.890
his friends reliable witnesses.

16:10.860 --> 16:13.410
Drunken degenerates, the lot of them.

16:13.460 --> 16:15.490
Sorry, excuse me.

16:15.540 --> 16:17.290
Davey, it's not a good time.

16:17.340 --> 16:20.690
Now, look, I'm down at the
mortuary now with Helen's aunt.

16:20.740 --> 16:23.530
She's given us a positive ID on
the body, but I get the impression

16:23.580 --> 16:25.570
they weren't exactly
close back in the day.

16:25.620 --> 16:28.090
I think we should probably
do a DNA test to be sure.

16:28.140 --> 16:31.130
Yeah. Makes sense, given
the circumstances.

16:31.180 --> 16:34.250
Listen, I'm with the Foxbys now.
Do you think I should mention it?

16:34.300 --> 16:37.250
Yeah. Yeah. I think they've
got a right to know.

16:37.300 --> 16:40.040
- OK. I'll speak to you later.
- OK.

16:42.060 --> 16:44.730
Sorry about that.

16:44.780 --> 16:48.330
A woman was found dead
in Lighthaven this morning.

16:48.380 --> 16:51.930
We have reason to believe
it was Helen Boyd.

16:51.980 --> 16:54.650
Helen Boyd died in 1994.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.970
How can you be sure? No body was found.

16:58.020 --> 17:00.930
This changes what we know about
your brother's disappearance.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.810
It changes nothing.

17:02.860 --> 17:06.130
If Jerry didn't kill himself that
night, he'd be dead by now anyway.

17:06.180 --> 17:10.810
What my husband is trying to say is
that Jerry was emotionally unstable.

17:10.859 --> 17:14.970
He was a known addict with a history
of self-destructive behaviour.

17:15.020 --> 17:16.569
He was a disaster waiting to happen.

17:16.619 --> 17:20.260
Trust me when I tell you my
brother is never coming back.

17:22.020 --> 17:24.160
Were you home last night?

17:26.140 --> 17:30.500
Yes. All night. We both were.

17:32.300 --> 17:33.900
That's right.

17:35.020 --> 17:37.730
Now, will you please leave my property?

17:37.780 --> 17:41.380
You can address any further
questions to my solicitor.

17:50.980 --> 17:53.410
Hi. Headlines?

17:53.460 --> 17:55.570
Well, we know she'd been drinking,

17:55.620 --> 17:59.450
but the blood screening also
showed opiates in her system.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.570
We're still awaiting
tests to confirm levels.

18:02.620 --> 18:06.250
And there was also this injection
puncture in one of her arms.

18:06.300 --> 18:09.570
Now, I'm thinking it might
be an accidental overdose.

18:09.620 --> 18:12.330
Except the police didn't find any syringes

18:12.380 --> 18:14.650
or drug paraphernalia at the scene,

18:14.700 --> 18:18.490
so if she was injected,
somebody else did it.

18:18.540 --> 18:20.650
Was there any bruising? Or defence wounds?

18:20.700 --> 18:21.850
Nah.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.290
Maybe they... I dunno, snuck
up on her when she was asleep?

18:26.340 --> 18:28.500
Thanks, Clint.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.660
You spent years hiding away and
the minute you talk, this happens.

18:38.060 --> 18:40.860
But I never told anyone where you were.

18:45.580 --> 18:49.170
So, whoever did this
knew where to find you.

18:49.220 --> 18:51.810
You said you wanted the truth to come out.

18:51.860 --> 18:55.860
Well, I'm going to do my best
to make sure that happens.

19:03.540 --> 19:06.810
Peggy? What's wrong?

19:06.860 --> 19:08.330
I shouldn't be here.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.180
No, wait. Please.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.500
I can't pretend I didn't see anything.

19:16.340 --> 19:18.650
There have been too many secrets.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.970
Go on.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.100
Not out here.

19:29.140 --> 19:31.680
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

19:33.460 --> 19:37.290
I take it the Foxbys
don't know you're here?

19:37.340 --> 19:39.480
I'd be fired on the spot.

19:40.260 --> 19:43.970
In my job, loyalty and
discretion are everything.

19:44.020 --> 19:47.650
Whatever you tell me will be dealt
with in the strictest confidence.

19:47.700 --> 19:50.290
I don't want to testify.

19:50.340 --> 19:54.610
I couldn't do that -- stand up
in court and betray the family?

19:54.660 --> 19:57.660
Let's just worry about the facts for now.

19:58.860 --> 20:03.940
He wasn't at home the whole
night. His Lordship, I mean.

20:05.540 --> 20:09.140
I heard an engine starting
in the early hours --

20:10.340 --> 20:12.940
I've always been a light sleeper --

20:14.580 --> 20:19.610
looked out the window and saw
his car driving off somewhere.

20:19.660 --> 20:22.660
It came back about an hour later.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.890
An hour would've been more than enough

20:25.940 --> 20:27.690
to get to Helen's place and back.

20:27.740 --> 20:30.010
So, you think Antonia is covering for him?

20:30.060 --> 20:32.180
Possibly...

20:34.300 --> 20:37.170
.. but they do have separate bedrooms

20:37.220 --> 20:40.700
so he could've come and
gone without her noticing.

20:41.780 --> 20:44.770
She came to me! All I'm asking
is for you to tread carefully.

20:44.820 --> 20:48.970
She's worried she's going to lose her job and
there might be a perfectly reasonable explanation.

20:49.020 --> 20:51.090
Yeah, but you don't think there is?

20:51.140 --> 20:53.450
I think you should bring
Oliver Foxby in for questioning

20:53.500 --> 20:55.330
and leave Peggy's name out of it for now.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.490
Well, whilst I don't have problem
arresting a senior civil servant

20:58.540 --> 21:02.500
and soon-to-be-earl, I think my
governors might want some evidence.

21:03.660 --> 21:05.290
He lied about leaving the house.

21:05.340 --> 21:08.130
Well, according to a witness
I'm not allowed to mention!

21:08.180 --> 21:12.130
- Anyway, he could've been going
anywhere. - I'm not asking you to
strip search him, just bring him in!

21:12.180 --> 21:16.050
His solicitor will tear us to shreds
before we get the first question out.

21:16.100 --> 21:19.090
Fine. We need to find another
way to prove he lied.

21:19.140 --> 21:20.570
All right.

21:20.620 --> 21:24.130
That petrol station where we stopped
on the way to Helen Boyd's place.

21:24.180 --> 21:25.450
Yeah.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.450
It had CCTV on the forecourt.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.530
There's just a chance it may have
picked up what went past last night.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.530
Genius. Worth a try.

21:32.580 --> 21:36.080
All right, then. You can
get the popcorn, though.

21:43.340 --> 21:44.660
There!

21:46.340 --> 21:48.170
Same make as Oliver's.

21:48.220 --> 21:50.560
All right, let's have a look.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.170
Oh, yeah.

21:55.220 --> 21:56.570
Bingo.

21:56.620 --> 22:00.330
- Surely that's enough
to bring him in? - Hm?

22:00.380 --> 22:03.890
Davey, this proves he was in
the area and he's got motive.

22:03.940 --> 22:07.210
If word got out that Jerry was
still alive it would scupper

22:07.260 --> 22:10.090
his plans to become the
next Earl of Solberry.

22:10.140 --> 22:11.690
Davey?

22:11.740 --> 22:15.180
Yeah, yeah, I'll pick him up.
There's something I got to do first.

22:26.140 --> 22:27.930
Your pension fund?

22:27.980 --> 22:29.210
I wish.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.330
The lads found a key attached to the 
sink in the back of Helen Boyd's place.

22:32.380 --> 22:35.980
We traced it to this
bank, so I got a warrant.

22:38.540 --> 22:39.970
You thinking what I'm thinking?

22:40.020 --> 22:41.250
Yeah.

22:41.300 --> 22:44.250
We should pocket this and jump
on the first flight to Mexico.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.370
This is what's left of Jerry's big win.

22:47.420 --> 22:49.210
Could be.

22:49.260 --> 22:53.330
According to Helen Boyd's landlord, her rent's
been paid for in cash for as long as he can remember.

22:53.380 --> 22:55.570
It looks like she's been
living off this for years.

22:55.620 --> 22:58.220
So someone bought Helen's silence.

22:59.220 --> 23:01.970
Oliver Foxby works at the Home Office.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.770
He could've hidden Helen away,

23:03.820 --> 23:06.170
created a new identity
for her as Rebecca Henson.

23:06.220 --> 23:07.370
Yeah.

23:07.420 --> 23:11.810
Then when she decided to come out
of hiding, she had to be silenced.

23:11.860 --> 23:13.330
Permanently.

23:13.380 --> 23:16.330
He seemed pretty sure that Jerry
was dead. Maybe he killed him, too?

23:16.380 --> 23:18.290
Oh!

23:18.340 --> 23:19.410
What?

23:19.460 --> 23:22.410
As soon as I mentioned her, it
would've set alarm bells ringing.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.730
He knew where to find her.
If I hadn't said anything...

23:24.780 --> 23:27.530
Come on, come on, don't do
this. You couldn't have known.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.010
This isn't on you.

23:29.060 --> 23:30.860
Maybe. Maybe not.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.650
But if it was him, then the least I can do

23:33.700 --> 23:35.290
is make sure he ends up in prison.

23:35.340 --> 23:39.810
Right. How often do you get the chance
to arrest a member of the aristocracy?

23:39.860 --> 23:41.860
Not often enough.

23:51.900 --> 23:55.540
You do realise you're making a
career-ending decision here?

23:59.020 --> 24:01.490
You're just doing your
job. He can't do anything.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.330
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

24:03.380 --> 24:05.690
But then you always did
like getting me in trouble.

24:05.740 --> 24:11.570
Wait! I called the solicitor.
Andrea's on her way.

24:11.620 --> 24:15.120
She said not to utter a
word until she gets there.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.770
I never left the house.

24:25.820 --> 24:27.260
Course.

24:28.860 --> 24:31.000
So, this isn't your car?

24:31.980 --> 24:33.650
It must have been stolen.

24:33.700 --> 24:35.930
Absolutely. And then returned to you?

24:35.980 --> 24:42.050
Possibly. Or it's another car
with false registration plates.

24:42.100 --> 24:45.210
Or, and go with me on
this one, it is your car,

24:45.260 --> 24:47.810
being driven by you, on your
way to confront Helen Boyd.

24:47.860 --> 24:49.490
About what?

24:49.540 --> 24:52.290
About what happened to your brother.
You wanted her to keep quiet.

24:52.340 --> 24:54.290
She refused, so you killed her.

24:54.340 --> 24:56.610
And why would I do that?

24:56.660 --> 24:58.370
It depends.

24:58.420 --> 25:00.850
Was she going to tell us
that Jerry is still alive?

25:00.900 --> 25:03.690
Or that you were involved in his murder?

25:03.740 --> 25:07.690
Look, as far as I am aware, Jerry's dead.

25:07.740 --> 25:12.340
But I didn't kill him and
I didn't kill that woman.

25:15.140 --> 25:19.620
An opiate was found in Helen Boyd's blood.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.890
This syringe contains traces of morphine.

25:23.940 --> 25:27.090
And I bet it will test positive
for the victim's DNA, as well.

25:27.140 --> 25:29.130
And what has that to do with me?

25:29.180 --> 25:33.260
It was found in the boot of your
car, underneath the spare wheel.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.570
(Say nothing more.)

25:42.220 --> 25:44.620
I have nothing further to say.

25:47.900 --> 25:51.580
All right, then. Well, why
don't you sleep on it?

25:53.900 --> 25:55.570
Wow. Late night?

25:55.620 --> 25:59.090
Mum and Mick spent half the
night arguing about wallpaper,

25:59.140 --> 26:00.850
and the other half "making up".

26:00.900 --> 26:02.290
Tell me you've got good news.

26:02.340 --> 26:04.930
No. Nothing, no. Oliver's
denying everything,

26:04.980 --> 26:07.730
Says he was in his bed all
night, doesn't know what happened

26:07.780 --> 26:09.890
to Jerry and he's never met
Helen Boyd in his life.

26:09.940 --> 26:11.290
At least he's consistent.

26:11.340 --> 26:13.530
That's exactly what he
told the police in '94.

26:13.580 --> 26:15.170
So, what now? You going to charge him?

26:15.220 --> 26:17.730
No. I've got a warrant, actually.
I'm going to search his house,

26:17.780 --> 26:19.010
see if that turns anything up.

26:19.060 --> 26:21.090
Mind if I join you?

26:21.140 --> 26:23.170
Why? What're you hoping to find?

26:23.220 --> 26:26.410
A postcard from Jerry saying,
"Venezuela's lovely, wish you were here."

26:26.460 --> 26:29.570
I want to lean on Antonia, find
out how much she really knows.

26:29.620 --> 26:31.690
You're not going to let this go, are you?

26:31.740 --> 26:34.210
Not with Helen's death
on my conscience, no.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.580
All right, come on, then,
fellas -- you're with me.

26:40.860 --> 26:44.580
Right, you're here as
an observer, remember?

27:00.900 --> 27:03.410
Is all this entirely necessary?

27:03.460 --> 27:05.410
I'm afraid so.

27:05.460 --> 27:08.810
This is madness. It wasn't him!

27:08.860 --> 27:14.450
I love the man, but he doesn't have
the imagination to be a murderer.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.050
So, who was it, then?

27:16.100 --> 27:18.100
How should I know?

27:23.900 --> 27:26.850
Don't believe that "butter
wouldn't melt" look.

27:26.900 --> 27:28.930
Jerry was a trouble-maker even then.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.650
You didn't like him?

27:30.700 --> 27:33.010
He didn't make our lives easy.

27:33.060 --> 27:36.170
Antonia, if you know something that
could help your husband, then...

27:36.220 --> 27:38.060
Jane!

27:39.460 --> 27:40.940
Excuse me.

27:50.660 --> 27:52.220
Up here.

27:57.580 --> 27:58.940
Thanks.

28:02.900 --> 28:04.370
Davey?

28:04.420 --> 28:08.370
Morphine. In the name of Elizabeth Foxby.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.330
- That's the Countess.
- Yeah.

28:10.380 --> 28:13.370
We've got syringes and
latex gloves, as well.

28:13.420 --> 28:15.730
Right, I'm going to
head back to the station.

28:15.780 --> 28:16.810
What, already?

28:16.860 --> 28:19.370
Yeah, with all this evidence,
I've got enough to charge him.

28:19.420 --> 28:21.250
Fairly solid case, I'd say.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.570
Can you give me five minutes?

28:22.620 --> 28:25.530
- What for? - Antonia knows
something, I'm sure of it.

28:25.580 --> 28:27.250
About Jerry or Helen?

28:27.300 --> 28:29.130
I dunno. Maybe both.

28:29.180 --> 28:30.730
OK.

28:30.780 --> 28:34.130
Jim, can you bag all
this up for me, please?

28:34.180 --> 28:35.940
OK, Sarge.

28:37.460 --> 28:39.490
He's going to prison for a long time.

28:39.540 --> 28:42.570
We've got motive, means and opportunity.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.690
The family will be disgraced.

28:44.740 --> 28:48.850
Oliver didn't go anywhere. It was me.

28:48.900 --> 28:53.570
I went to offer that woman more
money to keep her stupid mouth shut.

28:53.620 --> 28:56.610
You knew Helen was still alive? How?

28:56.660 --> 29:02.730
The night Jerry disappeared, I
went to his yacht to see him.

29:02.780 --> 29:04.010
The phone records.

29:04.060 --> 29:07.490
There were calls from the mobile,
Jerry's mobile, to your house.

29:07.540 --> 29:09.610
But you told the police
you never spoke to him.

29:09.660 --> 29:10.930
I didn't.

29:10.980 --> 29:13.890
But he kept calling, leaving
messages, asking to see me.

29:13.940 --> 29:15.970
Were you two...?

29:16.020 --> 29:19.490
We'd had a brief, foolish fling.

29:19.540 --> 29:26.370
I only went there to convince him
it was over, but when I arrived...

29:26.420 --> 29:29.050
'I don't know what to do!
I didn't mean to hurt her!'

29:29.100 --> 29:31.410
What are you doing?

29:31.460 --> 29:34.210
Do you want to spend the
rest of your life in jail?

29:34.260 --> 29:37.290
It was my fault. I pushed her and...

29:37.340 --> 29:41.490
Sh. We're going to sort this.

29:41.540 --> 29:45.450
I'll get rid of the body, and
then you need to disappear.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.450
"Disappear"?

29:47.500 --> 29:50.130
Go abroad. As far away as possible.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.570
For how long?

29:51.620 --> 29:56.490
Jerry, you're a murderer.
You can never come back.

29:56.540 --> 29:58.890
'And you knew he hadn't killed her.'

29:58.940 --> 30:01.570
It was the perfect opportunity
to get rid of him, wasn't it?

30:01.620 --> 30:04.610
So he didn't spill the
beans, destroy your marriage.

30:04.660 --> 30:06.050
What happened next?

30:06.100 --> 30:08.570
Jerry went on the run.

30:08.620 --> 30:11.410
He said he'd go to Kenya
-- he had friends there.

30:11.460 --> 30:13.970
I persuaded him to leave his winnings,

30:14.020 --> 30:17.050
said it would look more
suspicious if the money was gone.

30:17.100 --> 30:21.570
I waited for Helen to come
round, then I made her a deal.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.210
Who are you?

30:23.260 --> 30:25.010
I'm here to help you.

30:25.060 --> 30:27.850
In fact, I'm going to make you rich.

30:27.900 --> 30:30.290
I wasn't just thinking of me.

30:30.340 --> 30:32.970
The state Jerry was in back then,

30:33.020 --> 30:36.330
sooner or later he was going
to push his luck too far.

30:36.380 --> 30:40.450
Better he start a new life,
away from all these temptations.

30:40.500 --> 30:45.130
As for the woman, well, she was
a drug-addled prostitute

30:45.180 --> 30:48.530
scared witless by the
gang who controlled her.

30:48.580 --> 30:52.970
I used some of Jerry's money
to offer her an escape.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.050
So when Helen resurfaced,

30:55.100 --> 30:58.450
you were worried she'd tell
the truth, so you killed her.

30:58.500 --> 31:02.220
No! I didn't kill her
and neither did Oliver.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.290
Is this the gratitude I get?!

31:07.340 --> 31:12.610
Why should I be grateful
to you? You ruined my life!

31:12.660 --> 31:16.940
Tell the authorities and
we will both end up in prison!

31:20.100 --> 31:21.690
You think this is funny?

31:21.740 --> 31:25.210
You made my life a prison for 20 years.

31:25.260 --> 31:29.570
Nobody will believe you. My
lawyers will make sure of that.

31:29.620 --> 31:34.180
They'll say you killed Jerry
yourself and stole the money.

31:35.500 --> 31:38.210
Is that what this is about? Money?

31:38.260 --> 31:40.330
I can get more.

31:40.380 --> 31:42.530
Get out.

31:42.580 --> 31:44.500
Get out!

31:45.700 --> 31:50.500
Tell a soul and you'll regret it.

31:54.060 --> 31:57.820
When I left, Helen was still alive.

31:59.380 --> 32:01.860
Bang goes your solid case.

32:05.940 --> 32:07.730
My gut says she's telling the truth.

32:07.780 --> 32:11.650
Well, my gut says she's lying,
trying to cover for her husband.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.890
And, let's face it, my
gut's bigger than yours.

32:13.940 --> 32:16.370
- True. - Oi! You're
not supposed to agree.

32:16.420 --> 32:18.490
Maybe they're both involved?

32:18.540 --> 32:21.530
Well, we'll take fingerprints for anyone
who had access to the medicine

32:21.580 --> 32:24.370
and compare them to the ones
we found in Helen Boyd's place.

32:24.420 --> 32:27.290
In the meantime, I'll take a
formal statement from Antonia,

32:27.340 --> 32:29.610
see if her story stacks up.

32:29.660 --> 32:31.930
- Catch you later.
- Yeah.

32:36.340 --> 32:39.370
The only prints found in Helen
Boyd's place were her own.

32:39.420 --> 32:42.170
Antonia's still insists she was the one driving the car

32:42.220 --> 32:45.410
and she hasn't seen Jerry
since that night on the yacht.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.090
What's Oliver saying?

32:47.140 --> 32:50.450
On the advice of his solicitor,
he's now not saying anything at all.

32:50.500 --> 32:54.860
- So I don't know how we're going
to prove it one way or the other.
- There must be something in here.

32:59.700 --> 33:00.930
What's this?

33:00.980 --> 33:03.330
Hm? Oh, that's nothing.

33:03.380 --> 33:06.450
Just a receipt the lads found
in the medicine cabinet.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.890
I think they took my "bag it all
up" thing a bit too literally.

33:09.940 --> 33:11.770
Have you got the PM results yet?

33:11.820 --> 33:13.810
Yes. Helen was actually really ill.

33:13.860 --> 33:16.610
She had advanced lung cancer,
metastasized to her brain

33:16.660 --> 33:18.970
- so she wouldn't have had long.
- Would she have known?

33:19.020 --> 33:22.490
Probably. I'm guessing
that's why she came clean.

33:22.540 --> 33:26.850
Didn't want to take her
secret to the grave.

33:26.900 --> 33:29.330
Come on.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.050
Why? Where are we going?

33:31.100 --> 33:34.780
There's something I
want to catch on telly.

33:38.540 --> 33:40.680
Freeze it there. Zoom in.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.090
That's no good.

33:43.140 --> 33:45.020
OK, go forward.

33:46.020 --> 33:48.370
We've been through this
100 times already.

33:48.420 --> 33:49.690
Just humour me.

33:49.740 --> 33:51.500
Stop there.

33:53.380 --> 33:55.810
That looks like Peggy's car.

33:55.860 --> 33:59.810
I heard Mrs Foxby sneak out of the house.

33:59.860 --> 34:03.930
After that coroner's visit,
I knew something was up,

34:03.980 --> 34:08.290
something to do with
Jerry, so I followed her.

34:08.340 --> 34:12.530
It took me ages to summon up the nerve.

34:12.580 --> 34:14.929
By the time I knocked,

34:14.980 --> 34:21.420
that poor woman was already on the
floor with a syringe lying next to her.

34:22.380 --> 34:26.050
I imagined she must have overdosed.

34:26.100 --> 34:32.810
So, I took the syringe back home
and I hid it in his Lordship's car.

34:32.860 --> 34:34.690
Why?

34:34.739 --> 34:38.969
Because this proves that they were
behind what happened to Jerry!

34:39.020 --> 34:40.889
Well, not necessarily.

34:40.940 --> 34:43.810
Antonia says Oliver had nothing
to do with what happened to Jerry,

34:43.860 --> 34:45.050
so why frame him and not her?

34:45.100 --> 34:46.900
He must've known!

34:48.580 --> 34:50.489
So, what did you do with the gloves?

34:50.540 --> 34:54.620
We found fingerprints on the
syringe, but they weren't yours.

34:55.739 --> 34:58.340
I-I threw them away.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.610
In that woman's bin.

35:01.660 --> 35:05.250
Right, so you drove back to the
house to plant the evidence,

35:05.300 --> 35:06.850
and then back to Helen Boyd's place

35:06.900 --> 35:08.690
to get rid of the gloves -- is that right?

35:08.740 --> 35:10.210
No.

35:10.260 --> 35:13.900
No. I-I don't remember.

35:15.660 --> 35:19.410
Look, I've already told you I did it,

35:19.460 --> 35:21.890
so can we just get this over with?

35:21.940 --> 35:24.890
It's not as easy as that, I'm afraid.

35:24.940 --> 35:28.260
I'm not going to pretend I'm
sorry, if that's what you want.

35:30.140 --> 35:31.970
Imagine what it's done to Jerry,

35:32.020 --> 35:35.050
all these years thinking he's a murderer.

35:35.100 --> 35:38.380
All these years? So, Jerry's still alive?

35:40.860 --> 35:43.060
I don't know.

35:44.660 --> 35:48.220
Interview suspended at 14.30.

35:49.740 --> 35:51.620
Thanks, Peggy.

36:05.100 --> 36:09.010
Clint, it's me. Those
old files I gave you...

36:09.060 --> 36:12.130
Were there any fingerprints in there?

36:12.180 --> 36:15.570
Can you scan them and send them over to me

36:15.620 --> 36:17.890
as soon as you can? Thanks.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.980
Looks like we're just in time.

36:30.060 --> 36:33.890
St Christopher. Seems appropriate.

36:33.940 --> 36:35.500
Yeah.

36:37.060 --> 36:38.660
Hello, Jerry.

36:39.660 --> 36:41.610
You leaving us again already?

36:41.660 --> 36:42.850
I don't understand.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.980
Oh, I think you do.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.100
How did you know?

36:53.660 --> 36:56.450
A chemist's receipt.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.570
For, among other things, black hair-dye.

36:58.620 --> 37:01.210
You're the only one here with black hair,

37:01.260 --> 37:04.290
and you don't look the sort of
person to worry about a few grey hairs.

37:04.340 --> 37:06.210
Not unless you're hiding something --

37:06.260 --> 37:09.850
that your natural hair colour
is the bright Foxby red.

37:09.900 --> 37:11.770
Quite a leap.

37:11.820 --> 37:14.530
We checked your fingerprints
against the original police files.

37:14.580 --> 37:15.850
Ah.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.890
Peggy's covering for you, isn't she?

37:17.940 --> 37:20.610
She never went anywhere
near Helen Boyd's place.

37:20.660 --> 37:25.700
In my defence, it was her idea.

37:26.820 --> 37:30.930
When our plan to stitch
up Oliver went south,

37:30.980 --> 37:33.330
she wanted to buy me time to get away.

37:33.380 --> 37:34.570
Soppy old thing.

37:34.620 --> 37:38.570
So, convinced you were a
murderer, you fled the country,

37:38.620 --> 37:42.050
changed your appearance, waited for
the dust to settle, and then returned.

37:42.100 --> 37:46.010
Until one day, you discovered
you didn't kill Helen after all.

37:46.060 --> 37:51.010
All those years hiding away for
nothing. You wanted revenge.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.450
So you killed Helen and framed Oliver.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.290
All because Antonia lied to you.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.220
Nearly.

37:58.900 --> 38:01.740
I never intended to come back.

38:03.460 --> 38:09.010
A few years ago, I was involved in a nasty
car accident, needed facial surgery.

38:09.060 --> 38:12.410
During those weeks in the hospital,

38:12.460 --> 38:17.580
it occurred to me that I no longer
cared whether or not I was caught.

38:19.780 --> 38:23.930
I'd spent so many years hating
myself for what I'd done,

38:23.980 --> 38:29.810
or what I thought I'd done. I couldn't
believe how different I looked.

38:29.860 --> 38:33.450
And soon after, I read in the papers
that my mother was seriously ill.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.010
Dying, in fact.

38:35.060 --> 38:40.130
- You wanted to say goodbye? - Just see her
one last time. Be nearby when it happened.

38:40.180 --> 38:45.810
Then I'd hand myself in. When I showed up,
Peggy was the only one who recognised me.

38:45.860 --> 38:49.250
She passed me off as her
nephew and got me the job

38:49.300 --> 38:51.130
so I had an excuse to stick around.

38:51.180 --> 38:53.530
Your family didn't realise who you were?

38:53.580 --> 38:57.900
Just another servant, not
even worthy of their gaze.

38:59.780 --> 39:02.740
Anyway, Mother clung on for years.

39:04.140 --> 39:06.570
She always was a tough old bird.

39:06.620 --> 39:11.530
When she finally died, I couldn't
quite bring myself to come clean.

39:11.580 --> 39:16.570
I guess I'd got used to a simpler life.

39:16.620 --> 39:18.130
So, why did you kill Helen?

39:18.180 --> 39:21.490
Because of her role in
Antonia's deception?

39:21.540 --> 39:22.890
No, no, no, no.

39:22.940 --> 39:27.090
I killed Helen because she wanted me to.

39:27.140 --> 39:31.010
Peggy told me what you said,
that Helen might still be alive.

39:31.060 --> 39:33.210
I wanted to see for myself.

39:33.260 --> 39:37.530
'So that night I followed
Antonia in Peggy's car

39:37.580 --> 39:40.220
'then waited until she left.'

39:41.220 --> 39:42.900
Helen.

39:46.220 --> 39:49.100
It's really you, isn't it?

39:50.980 --> 39:52.580
Oh!

39:54.740 --> 39:57.980
All right, all right.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.450
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.340
- You're sick!
- Please.

40:07.460 --> 40:10.060
Who are you?

40:12.700 --> 40:15.220
I'm a friend of Jerry's.

40:17.660 --> 40:19.730
There's something I need you to do.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.570
'Helen begged me for help,'

40:21.620 --> 40:24.330
so I made her comfortable,

40:24.380 --> 40:26.770
then went back to the
house to get the morphine.

40:26.820 --> 40:30.450
This was a woman you barely knew,
and yet you helped her to die?

40:30.500 --> 40:32.570
She was in so much pain --

40:32.620 --> 40:36.650
she was threatening to throw
herself off the cliff!

40:36.700 --> 40:40.250
I couldn't just walk away. Especially not
after seeing what my mother went through.

40:40.300 --> 40:43.850
Anyway, it has a certain pleasing irony.

40:43.900 --> 40:49.210
I spent two decades feeling
guilty for killing Helen,

40:49.260 --> 40:52.410
and now that I've finally done
it, I feel no guilt at all.

40:52.460 --> 40:54.770
So, why did you frame Oliver?

40:54.820 --> 40:57.410
I watched him strut around for years

40:57.460 --> 41:00.050
telling everyone I'd
killed Helen in cold blood.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.690
My own brother!

41:01.740 --> 41:04.410
I decided it was his turn
to be called a murderer.

41:04.460 --> 41:07.370
For a while, at least.
And then I'd come clean.

41:07.420 --> 41:13.130
I thought perhaps I'd... I'd 
find a tropical beach somewhere

41:13.180 --> 41:16.250
and write it all down. Call it my memoirs.

41:16.300 --> 41:20.380
Well, why don't we go down the station and
you can write it all down there instead?

41:23.620 --> 41:27.580
Yeah. You're right.

41:29.460 --> 41:32.970
Might I at least finish
up here, get dressed?

41:33.020 --> 41:35.220
Yeah. Can I?

41:51.700 --> 41:54.370
- OK, then, on you go.
- Thank you.

41:59.660 --> 42:04.610
Congratulations. The copper who
finally caught Jerry Foxby.

42:04.660 --> 42:07.210
Yeah. With a little help from his friend.

42:07.260 --> 42:08.930
You might even get a medal.

42:08.980 --> 42:10.850
Well, I'd settle for a pay rise.

42:10.900 --> 42:12.370
I'll buy you a drink.

42:12.420 --> 42:14.330
Yeah? You feeling all right?!

42:14.380 --> 42:16.970
Yeah. We'll celebrate.

42:17.020 --> 42:19.250
All right, then.

42:19.300 --> 42:21.810
You all right in there, Jerry?

42:25.780 --> 42:28.220
Jerry?

42:30.180 --> 42:31.820
Jerry!

42:33.060 --> 42:34.940
What the hell?!

42:39.380 --> 42:41.460
JERRY!

42:52.940 --> 42:55.730
You let Oliver go?

42:55.780 --> 42:57.090
Yeah. All three of them.

42:57.140 --> 43:00.250
I think Peggy and Antonia might
still face charges, though.

43:00.300 --> 43:01.970
Do you think they'll catch Jerry?

43:02.020 --> 43:05.770
Well, we've circulated a recent
photo, alerted Border Force,

43:05.820 --> 43:08.370
but I can't say I'm overly optimistic, no.

43:08.420 --> 43:10.730
Bang goes my place in the
history books, doesn't it?

43:10.780 --> 43:12.410
Sorry. Maybe it's for the best.

43:12.460 --> 43:13.970
How do you work that out?

43:14.020 --> 43:16.250
Well, I can't condone what he did,

43:16.300 --> 43:20.170
but he spent years punishing himself
for a crime he didn't commit.

43:20.220 --> 43:22.890
Anyway, if we finally found Jerry Foxby,

43:22.940 --> 43:25.210
what would Mick's punters
have to argue about?

43:25.260 --> 43:26.410
That's very true.

43:26.460 --> 43:27.770
You might have a point there.

43:27.820 --> 43:31.130
To Davey Higgins, the copper
who let Jerry Foxby get away.

43:31.180 --> 43:32.650
Davey boy.

43:32.700 --> 43:33.770
Cheers, cheers.

43:33.820 --> 43:38.220
- Cheers.
- Very kind. A bit below the belt,
but very kind.
