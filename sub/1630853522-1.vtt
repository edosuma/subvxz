00:34.125 --> 00:37.375
- Finally, the moment everyone
has been waiting for.

00:38.333 --> 00:43.583
The final chapter to my 10-part series
on Earth's mightiest hero, Captain Marvel.

00:43.666 --> 00:44.666
Hulk smash.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.833
This week,
we're focusing on the battle of Earth.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.125
Now we all know the story.

00:48.208 --> 00:51.666
The Avengers were trying to save
the world, but if we're being honest here,

00:51.750 --> 00:54.250
they were losing, badly.

00:55.375 --> 00:58.666
Alien ships invading,
Thanos being a jerk about magical Stones.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.875
-Our heroes were done for.

01:00.958 --> 01:02.791
- Until...

01:03.791 --> 01:05.500
Captain Marvel blasted in!

01:05.583 --> 01:08.125
Now who was this glorious,
well-coiffed hero?

01:08.208 --> 01:10.708
Due to my extensive research
and my diligent studying

01:10.791 --> 01:12.541
of Scott Lang's podcast interviews,

01:12.625 --> 01:14.000
who seems like a pretty cool guy.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.708
I've learned a lot about Captain Marvel

01:15.791 --> 01:17.708
and I know at least
three things to be true.

01:17.791 --> 01:21.416
One, she blasted through Thanos's fleet
like a flaming angel.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.458
And you know what?
She looked good doing it.

01:25.666 --> 01:28.875
Two, she, like, punched Thanos
right in the face.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.541
- You're finished!

01:30.625 --> 01:32.291
- No offence to any
of the other Avengers,

01:32.375 --> 01:34.208
but I really don't think
they could've done that.

01:34.541 --> 01:38.583
And three, sometimes, someone can come out
of nowhere and do something amazing.

01:38.958 --> 01:42.125
I know some of you think,
"Well, she abandoned the people of Earth."

01:42.208 --> 01:43.458
But look, it's not true.

01:43.541 --> 01:45.791
Obviously we don't know
exactly what she's been up to.

01:45.875 --> 01:48.333
But maybe she just needed a break,
you know?

01:48.416 --> 01:49.875
Can a woman just live, hmm?

01:50.916 --> 01:54.041
Maybe we'll learn something new
at AvengerCon this weekend.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.666
I'm gonna be dressed as Captain Marvel.
Obviously.

01:56.916 --> 01:58.916
Anyway, that's all I got for this week.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.458
Next week, I'm gonna kick off a special
two-part series

02:01.541 --> 02:03.541
on why I think Thor is secretly a gamer.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.750
Remember, new episodes drop
every Wednesday.

02:05.833 --> 02:09.041
Be sure to like, comment and subscribe
at Sloth Baby Productions.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.458
-- Kamala Khan.
-Coming, Ammi.

02:24.083 --> 02:26.833
- Hurry up. You're going to be late
for your driving test.

02:28.875 --> 02:31.208
Aamir, if you
don't stop praying long enough

02:31.291 --> 02:35.250
to put some food in your mouth,
one day you will starve to death.

02:35.583 --> 02:37.791
May Allah forgive you one day.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.875
- Kamala, please don't forget to

02:39.958 --> 02:42.208
look at the mirrors
every 15 seconds at least.

02:42.291 --> 02:43.333
Yes, yes, yes.

02:43.416 --> 02:48.958
Oh, Kamala, my Kamala,
the road is a long and winding one,

02:49.041 --> 02:51.125
so never fully stop at stop signs.

02:51.208 --> 02:53.166
-Way too early for poetry, Abbu.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.416
- All right, listen.

02:54.541 --> 02:58.416
You do know that you don't really have
to look in the mirrors that often?

02:58.500 --> 02:59.750
Yes, she does.

03:00.250 --> 03:04.375
Listen, just make sure that the instructor
can see you move your head, okay?

03:04.458 --> 03:07.333
And remember to say Bismallah
before you start the car.

03:07.416 --> 03:09.250
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.750
Don't even have a license.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.250
How about you start by turning the car on?

03:25.333 --> 03:26.833
- Pull out
whenever you're ready.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.166
Bismallah.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.250
Bless you.

03:40.666 --> 03:41.958
I don't think anyone saw.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.041
That's my car.

03:55.125 --> 03:56.458
- You set her up to fail,

03:56.541 --> 03:59.250
having her drive in the street
with all the other cars.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.416
I have taught her to drive myself.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.958
Ma'am, because of your daughter,
I'm walking home.

04:04.041 --> 04:05.750
Oh, come on. Are you trying to tell me

04:05.833 --> 04:08.750
she didn't look in the mirrors
enough for you and your clipboard?

04:08.833 --> 04:10.291
I wouldn't say that's the problem.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.458
-- Oh!
-Then you'll also say that

04:12.541 --> 04:14.958
you expected her to signal
at every single turn?

04:15.125 --> 04:16.208
Yeah.

04:16.708 --> 04:18.666
-Choro ji.
-Kamina kahika!

04:18.750 --> 04:19.791
Give me my keys.

04:20.708 --> 04:22.416
Okay, Kamala, come on. Chalo.

04:23.875 --> 04:27.291
I'm so sorry that this family car,
you know, that your father earned

04:27.375 --> 04:31.416
with his very hard-earned money,
it has seen a lot of trauma.

04:31.708 --> 04:34.500
Hmm. I'm also sorry
that you're not going to be able

04:34.583 --> 04:38.041
to help me with all the things for your
brother's wedding you said you would.

04:38.541 --> 04:41.250
This is my fault. This is all my fault.
These are my genetics.

04:41.333 --> 04:45.125
I mean, I come from a long line
of fantasizing, unrealistic daydreamers.

04:45.208 --> 04:46.500
My mother was one.

05:00.625 --> 05:03.750
Camelia, glad you're not bruising
from that dodgeball incident.

05:04.416 --> 05:05.416
Oh!

05:09.583 --> 05:11.750
- Why is she waving? That's weird.

05:13.375 --> 05:14.916
Hey, guys.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.666
I'm just gonna sneak in there
and grab my chem text book.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.625
- We're in the middle of something.
One sec.

05:22.208 --> 05:24.583
I'll google the periodic table. Yeah.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.333
Rough morning all around.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.916
Had a bet you were gonna pass,
so now I'm out 10 bucks.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.833
I told my mom to stop texting you guys.

05:34.916 --> 05:38.750
Plenty of people fail their driver's test.
Instructors focus on the tiniest things.

05:38.833 --> 05:40.416
I crashed my car into his car.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.583
Oh. That's on you. Yeah. Uh...

05:44.666 --> 05:48.625
-So I guess we're not going to AvengerCon.
-No, no, no, Bruno.

05:48.708 --> 05:53.583
A cosplay competition for Carol Danvers
at the greatest fan event of the year.

05:53.666 --> 05:56.041
My costume is near perfect,
pending the final flourish.

05:56.125 --> 05:57.750
Still trying to think of that flourish?

05:57.833 --> 06:00.458
-It'll come to me any second now.
-Sure it will.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.291
-I'm sorry. I really do love you.

06:04.541 --> 06:07.583
Got any plans this weekend?
As of this morning, Kamala and I are free.

06:07.666 --> 06:08.666
- No.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.250
- Are you inviting me
to play Smash Bros?

06:10.375 --> 06:13.208
-Because if so, I'm busy.
-Don't hate the player, hate the game.

06:13.291 --> 06:15.500
The thing is I do hate the game, though.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.708
-- Really?

06:19.125 --> 06:21.541
-Sorry, Zoe.
-It's fine.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.375
- I like your jacket.

06:25.166 --> 06:28.041
Thanks. I like your necklace.

06:28.583 --> 06:29.583
- Thanks.

06:29.666 --> 06:31.666
It's actually my name in Arabic.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.625
Okay, see you later.

06:36.291 --> 06:38.541
Would it be super weird if we asked her
for a ride to AvengerCon?

06:38.625 --> 06:39.625
-Yes.
-Why?

06:39.750 --> 06:41.500
Her mom used to drive us
to school all the time.

06:41.958 --> 06:45.583
Because she is the absolute worst
now that she has 100,000 followers.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.666
80,000.

06:46.750 --> 06:49.500
- Kamala Khan,
please come to my office ASAP.

06:49.958 --> 06:52.666
You've done something very wrong.
Just kidding. It is crazy that the

06:52.791 --> 06:53.916
whole school can hear this.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.416
No, nothing is wrong.
I just wanna chat. Can't wait.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.041
-PS, this is Mr. Wilson.
-Thank you, Mr. Wilson.

07:02.583 --> 07:05.541
Okay, first off, I just wanna say

07:05.625 --> 07:06.625
I get it.

07:07.791 --> 07:08.958
You get what?

07:09.041 --> 07:10.833
I hear you've had a hectic couple weeks.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.291
Very funny.

07:16.416 --> 07:20.333
But your teachers, you know, they're
telling me you're doodling all day,

07:20.416 --> 07:23.250
staring off into space
in your little fantasy land.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.416
Hey.
Oh... Really?

07:25.500 --> 07:28.000
We truly started the meeting
30 seconds ago.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.791
-You gotta be with me, girl.
-Yeah. Sorry, Mr. Wilson.

07:30.875 --> 07:33.333
No. Mr. Wilson was my father.

07:34.583 --> 07:38.833
My name is Gabe. His name was also Gabe.
So, doesn't super-work.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.583
But let's talk about you. In junior year,

07:41.666 --> 07:44.208
it's time to start really thinking
about your future.

07:44.583 --> 07:48.166
I mean, college admissions are coming up,
before you know it, it's SATs,

07:48.333 --> 07:50.333
it's essays, it's applications.

07:50.458 --> 07:53.125
Do you volunteer? 'Cause
college admissions eat that up.

07:53.250 --> 07:56.666
I mean, of course,
do it to help people too, but I mean...

07:56.750 --> 07:58.625
It helps. It does help.

08:00.666 --> 08:02.958
Oh, no. No, I'm not...

08:03.041 --> 08:04.583
You know I'm not trying
to scare you, right?

08:04.666 --> 08:08.875
Do I have to figure out my whole future
before lunch or is there, like...

08:08.958 --> 08:11.875
I'm gonna give you a task.
I want you to go home.

08:11.958 --> 08:14.125
Not right now, but after school.

08:14.208 --> 08:17.416
Then you're gonna look yourself
in the mirror and ask yourself,

08:17.500 --> 08:23.416
"Kamala, who is that girl I see
staring straight back at me?"

08:24.416 --> 08:27.708
-You're reciting lyrics from Mulan.
-I am, I am.

08:27.791 --> 08:28.791
You are.

08:28.916 --> 08:33.541
Okay, Kamala, all I'm saying is
right now, I see a girl divided.

08:33.916 --> 08:36.125
"Is she there or is she there?
Where's Kamala?"

08:36.208 --> 08:39.375
Who knows? No one knows.
I don't even know. I can't see. Where?

08:39.458 --> 08:42.166
And I know. I know fantasy's fun,
fantasy's really fun.

08:42.250 --> 08:46.958
But right now, I need you to
pull yourself together and join reality.

08:51.333 --> 08:54.375
- You know, the plan was perfect.
I was gonna get my license.

08:54.458 --> 08:57.833
Then under the cover of stupid
wedding errands, we just have, like,

08:57.916 --> 09:00.166
one pure, beautiful day of freedom
at AvengerCon.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.750
-Guess there's always next year.
-No, there's no next year.

09:04.833 --> 09:07.333
This is the first one ever.
And then future historians,

09:07.416 --> 09:11.291
they're gonna start writing about it,
and where does it start? Here.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.583
Okay? There's not gonna be another
first AvengerCon ever again. Never.

09:17.250 --> 09:20.291
-Switch to the back-up plan then.
-You have a back-up plan?

09:20.791 --> 09:23.750
What's... What's your back-up plan?

09:25.416 --> 09:26.875
In concept, it is pretty easy.

09:26.958 --> 09:30.000
But it's gonna take a lot of finesse
and subtlety on your part.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.500
And you just aren't...

09:34.000 --> 09:36.041
-I can be subtle.
-You can be subtle?

09:36.125 --> 09:40.083
Okay. Listen, you enter your home,
you sit down at the dinner table,

09:41.208 --> 09:43.791
smile, and you ask your mom.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.125
-You're an idiot.
-I'm not. I'm actually a genius.

09:46.208 --> 09:49.250
So, can we stop acting
like your mom is Darth Vader?

09:50.041 --> 09:52.250
Every single thing I love,
she seems to hate.

09:52.333 --> 09:55.458
And it's like she thinks I'm some kind of,
you know, weirdo.

09:55.791 --> 09:57.708
You are a weirdo. Whoa!

09:58.000 --> 09:59.166
What?

09:59.250 --> 10:00.708
If I'm weird, you're weirder.

10:00.791 --> 10:05.083
I know. But more importantly,
I've gotten weirdly good at airbrushing.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.250
I put the rest of it together, but okay.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.000
-So...
-You think we'll win?

10:10.083 --> 10:12.166
- Please.
We're going, we're conquering.

10:12.875 --> 10:16.125
And we're high-fiving in slow motion.

10:17.291 --> 10:20.291
Bruno, I still need to figure out
my final flourish for my costume.

10:20.375 --> 10:22.125
-Any ideas?
-- Okay.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.000
How about steampunk Captain Marvel?

10:24.083 --> 10:26.041
-Steampunk is dead.
-Okay, fine.

10:26.125 --> 10:29.666
How about a mashup?
Like Captain Panther or Iron Marvel?

10:29.791 --> 10:32.833
Ooh, Doctor Strange Marvel.
I can, like, wear a cape.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.416
-- Capes are cool.
-Even Asgardian.

10:34.708 --> 10:36.958
You know, be like a badass Valkyrie,
ride a horse.

10:37.041 --> 10:38.875
I can't build you a horse,
but otherwise...

10:38.958 --> 10:41.083
You can build me sloth baby wings.
That's very me.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.958
Completely you. Wings, a little tiara.

10:44.041 --> 10:45.833
-- Playing here.
-Captain Princess Marvel.

10:45.916 --> 10:48.541
No princesses. I'm sorry.
You know what's even better?

10:48.666 --> 10:50.125
-What?
-Zombie Captain Marvel.

10:50.208 --> 10:54.083
I could be like, "I'll eat your brains.
But I also have super powers."

10:54.166 --> 10:56.958
Okay. Hey, let's never do
that zombie impersonation again.

11:01.458 --> 11:05.416
- Hi, Kamala beta. How are you?
Hmm? How was school?

11:05.791 --> 11:09.250
Apparently I have four days to
figure out my whole future, so that's...

11:09.333 --> 11:11.500
Don't be so dramatic, Kamala.

11:11.625 --> 11:14.833
What are you watching?
Turn that off.

11:19.458 --> 11:22.291
-Is this from Nani?
-Must be things for the baat paaki.

11:22.375 --> 11:25.083
Aamir. Aamir, come down here, please.

11:26.791 --> 11:28.541
Why'd she also send all this junk?

11:28.625 --> 11:31.333
I'd like to tell you
that it's because she's growing old,

11:31.416 --> 11:33.250
but she's always been this way.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.416
She doesn't want to die
before passing on all her junk to us.

11:36.708 --> 11:38.708
Aamir, have you lost your ears?

11:39.458 --> 11:41.916
This is so cool. Is this Nani's?

11:46.208 --> 11:49.375
That is junk.

11:51.250 --> 11:56.458
Aamir, here. Take this
and put it in the attic right now,

11:56.541 --> 11:58.333
and then unpack the groceries.

11:58.916 --> 12:01.958
-Why can't Kamala do it?
-She's going to help me with my errands.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.875
-You know the ones for your wedding?
-I am?

12:03.958 --> 12:07.041
Yes, you are. Chalo. Let's go.
Attic, and with me.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.916
-Chalo, Kamala, let's go.
-Don't mess up those errands.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.916
- Let's go. No time today.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.375
Kamala.

12:41.666 --> 12:43.875
-What's up, Najaf?
-- What's going on, Kamala?

12:43.958 --> 12:45.500
-Amma ji, kaisi hain?
-- Bilkul.

12:45.708 --> 12:47.208
Flying vultures in Armani suits

12:47.291 --> 12:48.625
buying up the whole neighborhood.

12:48.708 --> 12:51.125
Maybe we'll actually get
a Halal Guys this time.

12:51.208 --> 12:53.750
They charge you for extra sauce
at Halal Guys.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.500
- You're too short.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.666
She's not too short.
This thing is too long.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.708
- Shakat,
mere kapre taiyar hain?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.458
Salaam alaikum, Muneeba ji.

13:07.541 --> 13:08.666
Wa alaikum salaam.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.416
-Wedding shopping, I see.
-Mmm-hmm.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.333
Did you hear about
Fatima's engagement? Broken.

13:13.416 --> 13:14.458
Oi, what happened?

13:14.541 --> 13:16.833
She decided that she wasn't
ready for commitment.

13:16.916 --> 13:20.000
So now she's off gallivanting
through Europe to "discover" herself.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.500
What does she have
to discover about herself?

13:22.583 --> 13:23.583
- Good for her.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.458
I mean, she wanted to travel the world
and she went for it. So that's cool.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.875
She's trouble, this one.

13:31.958 --> 13:32.958
- Mmm-hmm.

13:33.083 --> 13:36.708
She's going to discover that
she doesn't have a ring on her finger.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.041
And then I saw her.

13:38.166 --> 13:43.000
She was getting very comfortable
with some gora boy named Rob in Belgium.

13:44.125 --> 13:47.958
-You're too short for that, Jaanu.
-Yes, you really are too short for that.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.916
-Handsome, huh?
-Oh, yeah, Mr. K.

13:51.875 --> 13:54.541
Okay. But what will this do?

13:54.625 --> 13:58.666
So this is a security camera, okay?
So you can see who's home from your phone.

13:59.208 --> 14:01.333
-From my phone?
-Oh, yeah, from your phone.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.500
We're living in the future.

14:03.583 --> 14:07.041
So, I made this myself. Okay?
This is the Zuzu system.

14:07.125 --> 14:10.125
It connects all your devices
and I added some new features.

14:10.208 --> 14:12.833
All you have to say is "Zuzu"
and tell it what you want.

14:12.916 --> 14:15.583
So... Zuzu, turn off the lights.

14:17.791 --> 14:20.333
-And I programmed it to understand Urdu.
-Urdu?

14:20.458 --> 14:21.750
Yeah. Zuzu.

14:22.416 --> 14:23.416
Batti kolo.

14:24.541 --> 14:25.791
Waah!

14:25.875 --> 14:27.791
-This is magic.
-Yeah, it's pretty cool.

14:27.875 --> 14:30.125
Cool? This is absolute magic.

14:30.208 --> 14:31.833
-Hi, Bruno beta.
-- Hey.

14:31.916 --> 14:33.250
Are you staying for dinner?

14:33.333 --> 14:36.125
-No, no, I got some work.
-Okay, I'll pack you something to go.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.791
-No, no, I'm good.
-- No, no, of course I will.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.208
-Hey.
-How was it?

14:40.291 --> 14:43.625
Don't mention Belgium
or any guy named Rob.

14:43.708 --> 14:47.416
Did you ask her about AvengerCon?
Kamala, ask her. Just ask her.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.666
Bruno, there's a spicy one
at the bottom for Nonna.

14:50.750 --> 14:51.750
-Okay?
-- Oh, my gosh.

14:51.833 --> 14:54.375
-How did you do that so fast?

14:54.458 --> 14:57.166
You stick to the gizmos, beta.
This is my secret.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.375
Okay. I'll see you soon.

14:58.458 --> 14:59.458
-See you soon.
-- Muneeba.

14:59.541 --> 15:00.708
- Haan? Bolo.

15:00.791 --> 15:01.916
Ask her.

15:04.041 --> 15:06.541
- Zuzu, switch to sports channel.

15:08.250 --> 15:12.458
So, Bruno has made this and he's connected
all the devices to this Zuzu.

15:12.541 --> 15:14.208
-- Okay.
-Watch this.

15:14.458 --> 15:15.916
-Abbu.
-Ah, defensive...

15:16.416 --> 15:17.458
-Ammi.
-- Mmm?

15:17.916 --> 15:20.000
So, there's this thing called AvengerCon.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.583
You know,
it's really something incredible.

15:23.666 --> 15:26.833
It's never been done before.
It's, like, the first fan event

15:26.916 --> 15:30.833
celebrating our great heroes of our time
and it's totally historic,

15:30.916 --> 15:33.791
and it's, like, very educational.
And Bruno is, um...

15:33.875 --> 15:36.750
Bruno, he's, like, really into this stuff,
you know, so he's...

15:37.208 --> 15:41.833
He really wants to go
and he asked me if I wanna tag along

15:41.916 --> 15:45.916
so that, you know, he's not alone,
because poor Bruno, right?

15:46.166 --> 15:47.958
He doesn't have much of a family.

15:48.416 --> 15:52.750
-Zuzu, TV rokna.
-So you want to go to a party, at night?

15:53.583 --> 15:55.458
-Is this a joke?
-No.

15:55.541 --> 15:58.208
Is Bruno recording this for Internet?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.708
No. It's... I'm 16.

16:03.083 --> 16:05.583
Look, I promise
I won't do anything stupid.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
-You do trust me, right?
-No. I don't trust you.

16:10.666 --> 16:13.041
-Of course she does.
-No, I don't.

16:14.041 --> 16:18.500
She does. We do.
It's just that we don't trust anyone else.

16:18.791 --> 16:22.541
You're still young and there are so many
strange people roaming around at night.

16:22.625 --> 16:23.958
Or strange boys.

16:24.041 --> 16:26.500
Thinking God knows know what
and drinking God knows what.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.750
It's not a party, it's a convention.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.958
And what exactly will you be doing there?

16:31.041 --> 16:33.125
There's a lot of stuff, actually.

16:33.208 --> 16:35.500
There's, like, this cosplay competition
which is...

16:35.583 --> 16:38.208
It's, like, this historical reenactment.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.625
- And how exactly
will you be dressed?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.500
As Captain Marvel.

16:43.583 --> 16:44.583
Huh?

16:44.833 --> 16:48.666
-Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel.
-Captain Marvel. Astaghfirullah.

16:49.083 --> 16:51.333
-Hey, salaam, everyone.
-She's a hero.

16:51.416 --> 16:53.500
-In a very tight suit.
-It's not that tight.

16:53.583 --> 16:54.666
Yes, it is.

16:54.750 --> 16:57.750
It's not like I'm asking to go to a party
and do cocaine.

17:00.208 --> 17:01.541
Not a lot of salaam here, huh?

17:02.958 --> 17:04.458
Now, if it was him asking...

17:06.333 --> 17:12.041
Be like, "Oh, yes, Aamir. Do what
you want, Aamir beta. Please, please."

17:12.125 --> 17:15.791
But me, no, because I can't do a single
normal teenage thing in this house, right?

17:16.083 --> 17:17.666
Come on, beta. You're not normal.

17:19.166 --> 17:22.541
Beta, I meant you're special.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.583
Knock, please.

17:38.750 --> 17:39.958
- Brought you some chai.

17:44.708 --> 17:46.291
Look, that was a bold move.

17:47.250 --> 17:50.250
Not very well thought out,
but I respect you for trying.

17:50.833 --> 17:52.666
You know, all she does to me is say no.

17:52.791 --> 17:56.083
It's, like, where is this
out of proportion worry for you?

17:58.583 --> 18:00.125
-I'll talk to them.
-Really?

18:00.208 --> 18:02.791
-Yeah. I mean, you look kinda pathetic.
-Thank you.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.708
-I got you.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.083
Night, Tiny K.

18:11.166 --> 18:14.583
You want me to turn off the lights
or are you still afraid of the djinn?

18:14.666 --> 18:18.666
-Okay, I'm not 12.
-This says you're 12. Good night.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.708
- Bike lock engaged.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.541
Just a second.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.750
- Kamala, what are you doing?

20:25.291 --> 20:26.291
Stretching.

20:26.708 --> 20:28.375
-Stretching?
-Yeah.

20:29.291 --> 20:32.625
So, your brother told us
about your Avengers party.

20:33.208 --> 20:34.666
-He did?
-Yes.

20:34.750 --> 20:37.458
And even though it will be
a distraction from your studies,

20:37.541 --> 20:40.291
and there will be
lot of haram going on there, Kamala,

20:40.833 --> 20:44.000
we have decided to let you go.

20:45.125 --> 20:49.166
-Really? Really? Really?
-Yes, but there are special conditions.

20:49.708 --> 20:54.083
Your Abbu will drive you there and he will
go inside with you for two hours.

20:54.166 --> 20:57.250
And as far as your dressing goes,

20:57.958 --> 20:59.791
I have a surprise for you.

21:00.958 --> 21:03.375
The Hulk.

21:03.791 --> 21:06.041
Wait, wait. Best is yet to come.

21:06.125 --> 21:07.125
Ta-da!

21:07.416 --> 21:09.083
Oye, chak de phatte!

21:14.458 --> 21:17.125
See, Kamala. Big Hulk and little Hulk.

21:17.541 --> 21:20.041
Bara Hulk aur choti Hulk!

21:20.125 --> 21:24.833
-So cute you all will look.
-Oh, my God. Okay, it's...

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Mmm.

21:27.708 --> 21:29.958
There's no big Hulk, little Hulk.
It's just not...

21:30.041 --> 21:32.750
-They are all heroes.
-This is mine and Bruno's thing, okay?

21:32.833 --> 21:36.375
Come on, bacchi.
Can't you make an exception for Abbu?

21:36.458 --> 21:39.458
I can't wear a salwar kameez
to AvengerCon, okay?

21:39.541 --> 21:41.333
And you can't come with me,

21:41.416 --> 21:44.416
not dressed like that,
because it is so humiliating.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.833
-Okay, I didn't mean it like that.
-- Bas, Kamala.

21:56.125 --> 21:58.958
If you don't go with your dad,
you're not going at all.

22:00.666 --> 22:02.166
I made this for you.

22:02.958 --> 22:06.625
You're not going to dress up like
all those other girls in skimpy outfits.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.416
That is not you.

22:18.083 --> 22:19.166
Abbu.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.708
You're not going.

22:41.541 --> 22:43.750
- So the worst thing
that could happen has happened.

22:43.833 --> 22:46.583
Is that code for "I fell into
the Hudson for the third time"?

22:46.666 --> 22:49.125
That's "Black Sloth Down."
And I fell in once, okay?

22:49.208 --> 22:52.416
-Twice.
-It means everything sucks.

22:54.416 --> 22:55.750
Meet me on the roof in 10.

22:59.708 --> 23:03.375
-You've never even seen them like that.
-Like what? Like, mad?

23:03.583 --> 23:06.833
Hurt. Bruno, I think I made my dad cry.

23:08.208 --> 23:10.250
Mr. Khan crying?
That's not good. That's...

23:10.750 --> 23:12.291
Yeah, but listen.

23:13.250 --> 23:15.500
Your mom and dad,
they're gonna calm down, okay?

23:15.875 --> 23:18.083
You're gonna apologize. It'll be fine.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.500
Yeah, but maybe they're right.

23:22.958 --> 23:25.666
Maybe I spend too much time with fan art,

23:25.750 --> 23:28.875
and costumes and with my head stuck
in fantasy land. So...

23:28.958 --> 23:30.458
-Who is "they"?
-My mom.

23:30.916 --> 23:33.416
My teachers. Mr. Wilson.

23:33.583 --> 23:34.708
Everyone.

23:35.041 --> 23:38.208
There was a girl who decided she wanted
to go backpacking around Europe.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.875
And you would literally think
she joined a death cult

23:40.958 --> 23:43.666
given the way all the aunties just gossip
about her.

23:44.541 --> 23:46.958
I'm lost. What does that have to do
with AvengerCon?

23:48.041 --> 23:50.125
Because dressing up as Captain Marvel
is weird.

23:50.208 --> 23:52.416
-No, it's not.
-It is childish.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.083
And I know that, okay?

23:54.166 --> 23:56.125
And let's be honest, it's not really

23:56.208 --> 23:58.791
the brown girls from Jersey City
who save the world.

24:01.166 --> 24:02.166
Sure they do.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.291
You're Kamala Khan.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.500
You wanna save the world?

24:11.875 --> 24:13.541
Then you're gonna save the world.

24:21.041 --> 24:24.375
With the right equipment, of course.
Speaking of, newest prototype.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.791
-Are those Photon gloves?
-Yeah.

24:29.708 --> 24:31.333
-Do you want them or...
-Yes.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.750
Oh, my God. You made these?

24:33.833 --> 24:36.250
-Yeah. I mean, do you like them?
-Yes.

24:37.083 --> 24:41.708
Oh! "Bruno Carrelli Corporations."
I like it. Has a nice ring to it.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.750
-How do they turn on?
-Right here. Bow!

24:44.833 --> 24:48.000
-See?
-This is cosmic. This is cosmic. Get up.

24:48.166 --> 24:49.708
-We're getting up.

24:49.791 --> 24:51.750
Listen, they don't shoot
real photon blasts.

24:51.833 --> 24:53.875
-I'm ready.
-Oh, we're fighting?

24:54.625 --> 24:56.291
-Oh, my gosh. Oh!

25:20.625 --> 25:22.250
Zoe! You did that on purpose.

25:22.333 --> 25:23.625
-No, I did not.
-Yes, you...

25:40.958 --> 25:43.291
- You're supposed to be
the latest in technology?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.541
Thank God I didn't pay for you, I say.

25:45.625 --> 25:48.000
What is it that I'm saying
you can't understand?

25:48.083 --> 25:52.541
I'm speaking in English, not code.
So here goes. Shall we try again? Okay.

25:52.625 --> 25:54.708
-- Good night, Abbu.
-Sleep tight, beta.

25:54.958 --> 25:57.875
Zuzu, please, switch the TV...

25:59.375 --> 26:03.125
Kamala, please tell Bruno
this Zuzu is possessed by the evil djinn.

26:03.208 --> 26:04.458
He needs to fix it.

26:05.458 --> 26:08.333
Zuzu, television, switch it on.

26:09.541 --> 26:11.583
If I can't leave the house
to go to AvengerCon,

26:11.666 --> 26:13.750
I'll go to AvengerCon
without leaving the house.

26:15.166 --> 26:16.791
How many slushies have you had today?

26:16.916 --> 26:19.708
Because all that red dye three,
it's making your brain...

26:20.958 --> 26:22.500
Look, it's illusions, old friend.

26:22.583 --> 26:24.458
You set up the smart house stuff
for my dad,

26:24.541 --> 26:27.625
so you're basically our inside man.

26:28.291 --> 26:31.166
-This is the plan.
-Kamala, you're the best sister ever.

26:31.250 --> 26:33.250
Honestly, you should
have been an only child.

26:33.333 --> 26:36.041
Kamala is the best daughter
in the whole wide world.

26:36.125 --> 26:39.583
-Stop, please. I'm shy.

26:39.875 --> 26:42.666
- - 49 p.m.,
I gracefully excuse myself.

26:42.750 --> 26:45.750
And as my family celebrates my existence,
I go to my bedroom.

26:45.833 --> 26:46.833
And it's...

26:47.625 --> 26:49.958
-Are you following?
-Yes. Keep going.

26:50.416 --> 26:52.000
- - 55, I suit up in the greatest

26:52.125 --> 26:54.583
Captain Marvel costume
the Earth has ever seen...

26:54.666 --> 26:56.625
Don't worry, it'll be finished by then,
I hope.

26:56.750 --> 27:00.666
Then I make my way out of the house
undetected but extremely impressive where

27:00.750 --> 27:04.541
you'll be waiting in your costume, which
better be awesome. Don't embarrass me.

27:04.625 --> 27:06.500
-- Me embarrass you?
-- Yeah, I said it.

27:07.333 --> 27:10.125
Oh, come on. I didn't even want beans.

27:10.208 --> 27:12.125
But what if your parents
go into your room?

27:12.833 --> 27:14.625
-That's where you come in, right?
-What?

27:14.791 --> 27:17.166
- You and your fancy Zuzu
system are going to be my cover.

27:17.250 --> 27:19.250
-So, when there's a knock on the door...

27:19.375 --> 27:21.375
-Don't come in. I'm changing.

27:21.458 --> 27:23.083
Finally, you being a genius
is coming in handy.

27:23.166 --> 27:24.166
- Sorry, beta. Sorry.

27:25.041 --> 27:26.708
- What do you mean "finally?"

27:26.791 --> 27:28.916
- - 30,
we catch the bus to Camp Lehigh.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.166
And it might be a tight window
but we're gonna do it with style.

27:32.833 --> 27:35.791
- Wait...
Is that us biking off a bridge onto a bus?

27:37.333 --> 27:39.666
- Dream bigger, Bruno!

27:41.666 --> 27:43.458
It's gonna be epic.

27:47.083 --> 27:50.416
We get on the bus just in time.
Everyone stares at us in awe

27:50.500 --> 27:52.958
because we look back at them
and their costumes are just... Meh.

27:53.125 --> 27:54.125
Okay.

27:54.500 --> 27:59.000
Then it's time for a tight but spontaneous
60 minutes of fun at AvengerCon.

28:03.125 --> 28:04.875
Then at- 00 p.m.,
the real reason we're here,

28:04.958 --> 28:07.041
the reason I learnt to sew
and you learnt to airbrush.

28:07.125 --> 28:08.125
The cosplay competition.

28:08.208 --> 28:12.083
I win, obviously. We collect my crown and
I'm assuming it's made of real diamonds.

28:12.166 --> 28:13.208
- It's definitely not.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.083
- Then after a few
quick photos with fans,

28:15.166 --> 28:17.791
maybe some chats with the press,
we bounce.

28:19.083 --> 28:22.875
I'll sneak back into my room just before
my dad comes in at- 22 p.m.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.250
That's the plan. Got it?

28:32.791 --> 28:36.041
So your plan is take the bus.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.958
All this, and that's your note? Really?

28:40.416 --> 28:43.916
Does how we get there matter
if you haven't finished your costume yet?

28:45.500 --> 28:48.041
They want you to bring some of you
to Captain Marvel, right?

28:49.416 --> 28:51.333
So your mom's Hulk isn't the right idea

28:51.416 --> 28:53.958
but maybe something Pakistani?

29:37.791 --> 29:39.875
Oh, my God, Aamir.

30:10.833 --> 30:14.791
-Ammi, I'm going to Taysha's this evening.
-Nice. Say hi to her parents from me.

30:14.875 --> 30:15.875
Yeh le lo ji aap.

30:16.166 --> 30:17.875
And which is why I always say,

30:18.083 --> 30:21.416
between the authorities and us the people,
we are to blame.

30:21.500 --> 30:25.041
And that is why the salamanders
are almost extinct in Pakistan.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.083
Which is why I'm also so worried
about the plight of the parrots.

30:29.166 --> 30:32.291
Speaking of parrots, you just reminded me
I have a biology report

30:32.375 --> 30:33.583
that's due tomorrow. So...

30:33.666 --> 30:36.666
Beta, you gotta listen to me
what I have to tell you about parrots.

30:36.750 --> 30:37.750
- Nope.

30:52.291 --> 30:53.291
Are you okay?

30:54.625 --> 30:55.625
Come on.

30:57.041 --> 30:59.333
-That was my way back in.
-I know. We missed the bus.

30:59.416 --> 31:02.416
We can still make the next one,
but if we miss it, it's game over.

31:15.291 --> 31:16.708
- No, no. Come on, come on.

31:29.083 --> 31:31.875
Stop. Wait, please. That's my bike.
Come on, man. Open the door.

31:32.541 --> 31:33.541
Dude.

31:35.708 --> 31:38.458
How likely is it I'm gonna find it there
when I get back?

31:39.250 --> 31:40.416
In Jersey City?

31:40.500 --> 31:43.958
Oh, I'd say you have a 0.0001% chance.

31:59.375 --> 32:00.875
- Bike lock engaged.

32:03.041 --> 32:05.291
-- We made it. We made it.
-- Yeah!

32:08.125 --> 32:09.333
- Sorry.

32:25.375 --> 32:26.541
Oh, my God.

32:34.208 --> 32:36.375
Yeah!

32:54.416 --> 32:55.458
Hey.

33:01.041 --> 33:02.541
-- Thank you.
-- Thank you.

33:30.541 --> 33:32.000
- Motion detected.

33:39.166 --> 33:41.541
-Aamir's out for the evening.
-Mmm-hmm.

33:41.625 --> 33:43.333
-Kamala is in her room.

33:43.416 --> 33:45.125
-Aah!

33:49.625 --> 33:51.833
- Coming up next,
the Captain Marvel cosplay contest.

33:51.916 --> 33:52.916
Showtime.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.083
- First place gets a...

34:04.541 --> 34:05.541
Here you go.

34:05.625 --> 34:08.083
-- Is that Zoe?
-You guys look amazing.

34:08.166 --> 34:09.916
Why is she here?

34:10.666 --> 34:13.666
-The costume's not even accurate.
-She doesn't even like the Avengers.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.166
It's okay. It's okay, okay?

34:15.250 --> 34:16.791
- I have to compete against her now?

34:16.875 --> 34:19.541
Don't worry about it.
It's your time to shine. Literally.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.958
-You have the gloves?
-Yeah. They're in my bag.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.791
- Last call for
the Captain Marvel cosplay competition.

34:44.208 --> 34:47.291
Cosplayers, please line up
on the side of the stage.

34:49.083 --> 34:52.500
AvengerCon, give it up.
Amazing Captain America cosplayers.

34:52.583 --> 34:55.708
Thank you, Captain America cosplayers.
Congratulations to the winner.

34:55.791 --> 34:58.583
You guys are all good to go.
We're kicking things off...

34:58.666 --> 34:59.666
Hi.

35:01.541 --> 35:04.291
Wow. You look great. Yeah, good.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.500
-What are you wearing?
-It's Bruce Banner.

35:07.458 --> 35:09.958
-What is that?
-My personal self-expression.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.083
Oh, cool. Okay.

35:11.333 --> 35:14.833
Yeah, but I can't get it on.
It's, like, sealed shut for some reason.

35:16.916 --> 35:18.791
-Where are the gloves?
-Oh, they're just...

35:22.375 --> 35:23.916
Crap. I left it in the bathroom.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.291
This is our final final call
for contestants to the stage.

35:28.375 --> 35:29.708
I'm gonna run and get it.

35:29.791 --> 35:32.958
No, we don't have time.
You gotta go. It's good. It's fine.

35:33.416 --> 35:35.666
You got the bangle. Put it on.

35:37.541 --> 35:40.458
Take your phones out. Show them the love.
They are here.

35:40.541 --> 35:41.541
Got it.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.958
-Did you see that?
-Come on. You gotta go.

36:21.041 --> 36:22.500
- ...amazing Captain Marvel.

36:22.625 --> 36:25.666
And we've got a final Captain Marvel
coming to the stage right now.

36:41.541 --> 36:42.708
- Oh, God.

36:51.708 --> 36:52.708
Come on, come on.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.041
Oh, my God.

37:35.166 --> 37:38.375
- Uh, all right.
Well, good luck following that, everybody.

38:02.416 --> 38:05.333
Wow. I thought my Captain Marvel costume
was gonna make people stare.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.916
Oh, my God.
Are you available to book for parties?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.208
You wanna take a picture?
I'll tag you. I follow back.

38:17.291 --> 38:18.541
-Mostly.
-Move.

38:21.125 --> 38:24.625
- Oh, my God! Help me! Help me!

38:45.375 --> 38:48.208
- What was that? Are you okay?
We need to go.

39:03.083 --> 39:05.583
- What just happened?
I don't even know what to say.

39:06.375 --> 39:08.666
- Okay, Bruno,
I actually have powers.

39:12.125 --> 39:13.750
Okay. Come on. Help me up.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.583
- Ready? Three, two, one.

39:20.666 --> 39:22.250
-Go.
-- Oh, gosh.

39:27.625 --> 39:29.833
Did that come out of your foot?
Are you okay?

39:29.916 --> 39:32.000
Hey, keep me updated.
And text me everything.

39:32.083 --> 39:33.625
- So weird. Hey.

39:34.208 --> 39:37.333
-Please don't tell anyone.
-Stop, okay? I'd never tell anyone.

39:38.666 --> 39:40.833
-Never ever?
-Never ever ever.

39:57.708 --> 39:58.708
- Kamala.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.833
Where have you been?

40:04.750 --> 40:06.208
What are you doing?

40:08.958 --> 40:11.166
I'm not recognizing you.

40:11.250 --> 40:16.750
Who is this rebellious girl
sneaking out, lying to Abbu and me?

40:17.541 --> 40:18.958
I'm not trying to be rebellious.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.166
- And I'm trying
to protect you from yourself.

40:21.958 --> 40:25.625
I've seen what happens when people
get obsessed with their fantasies.

40:25.708 --> 40:28.916
I know you're just gonna tell me
some story about Nani and...

40:30.333 --> 40:33.333
So you knew what I was
going to say tonight, huh?

40:34.833 --> 40:39.250
And you knew that it would betray me,
but you still went and did it anyway.

40:41.250 --> 40:45.000
-Sorry.
-It's time to stop fantasizing.

40:46.625 --> 40:51.291
I wish that you would just focus on you.

40:51.791 --> 40:55.541
Your grades. Your family.
Your story.

40:55.708 --> 40:59.000
I mean, who do you want to be
in this world, huh?

41:00.041 --> 41:04.208
Do you want to be good,
like we raised you to be,

41:04.708 --> 41:07.500
or do you want to be some, you know,

41:07.625 --> 41:11.333
this cosmic head-in-the-clouds person?

41:18.125 --> 41:19.583
You think about that.

41:55.125 --> 41:56.333
Cosmic.

44:00.875 --> 44:02.416
- Check this out.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.625
-Teenage girl at AvengerCon.
-- AvengerCon?

44:06.708 --> 44:08.791
A cosplayer with too much time
on their hands.

44:08.875 --> 44:11.750
Not this one.
I've never seen powers like that.

44:12.916 --> 44:14.250
- Whoa.

44:15.791 --> 44:17.166
Yeah, bring her in.
