01:06.984 --> 01:09.817
THE FIRST PHASE
OF THE TEA CEREMONY

01:09.818 --> 01:12.085
IS TO ADMIRE THE CUP.

01:12.086 --> 01:15.252
EACH CUP IS UNIQUE,
LIKE NO OTHER.

01:17.087 --> 01:19.119
I SAY YOU'VE SEEN
ONE TEA CUP,

01:19.120 --> 01:20.820
YOU'VE SEEN
THEM ALL.

01:20.821 --> 01:24.588
MEDITATE ON
THE INDIVIDUAL BEAUTY
OF YOUR OWN CUP.

01:24.589 --> 01:26.820
MEANWHILE, THE TEA
IS GETTING COLD.

01:26.821 --> 01:28.522
THE WAY OF
THE TEA CEREMONY

01:28.523 --> 01:31.456
IS THE WAY
OF PATIENCE, RAPHAEL.

01:31.457 --> 01:34.456
YOU KNOW, LIKE STOP
AND SMELL THE ROSES.

01:34.457 --> 01:37.157
OR HOLD
THE PEPPERONI.

01:37.158 --> 01:39.324
NOW SIP THE TEA.

01:41.592 --> 01:43.692
FEEL ITS VIBRATIONS

01:43.693 --> 01:45.758
COURSING THROUGH
YOUR BODIES.

01:49.228 --> 01:52.594
<i>I REALLY FEEL
THOSE VIBES,
SENSEI.</i>

01:52.595 --> 01:55.461
VIBES, MY FOOT.
IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE.

01:55.462 --> 01:57.227
I'M NOT SO SURE.

01:57.228 --> 01:59.661
LET'S CHECK
THE SURVEILLANCE GEAR.

02:05.397 --> 02:07.229
IT'S A MASSIVE VIBRATION

02:07.230 --> 02:08.663
FROM THE CENTER
OF THE EARTH.

02:08.663 --> 02:11.097
LIKE I SAID,
AN EARTHQUAKE!

02:11.098 --> 02:13.631
IT SEEMS TO BE
GETTING CLOSER.

02:13.632 --> 02:15.098
A MOVING EARTHQUAKE?

02:15.099 --> 02:16.899
YOUR GEAR
MUST BE WRONG.

02:20.267 --> 02:23.799
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IT COULD BE RIGHT.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.667
THERE'S ONLY
ONE OTHER THING
IT CAN BE--

02:26.668 --> 02:28.134
THE TECHNODROME.

02:28.135 --> 02:31.869
IF SHREDDER AND KRANG
HAVE GOTTEN IT
MOVING ONCE AGAIN,

02:31.870 --> 02:35.136
THE CONSEQUENCES
COULD INDEED BE DIRE.

02:35.137 --> 02:38.269
DUDES, LOOKS LIKE
SHOWTIME.

02:43.638 --> 02:46.405
AT LAST. AT LAST!

02:46.406 --> 02:48.138
THE TECHNODROME
MOVES AGAIN!

02:48.139 --> 02:50.939
THE WORLD
IS OURS, KRANG!

02:50.940 --> 02:53.006
THOSE MISSILE FUEL CELLS

02:53.007 --> 02:55.807
PROVIDE MORE
THAN ENOUGH ENERGY.

02:55.808 --> 02:58.141
AND WITH OUR
ENERGY RESTORED,

02:58.142 --> 02:59.875
OUR ENGINES REPOWERED,

02:59.876 --> 03:01.642
AND OUR
WEAPONS RECHARGED,

03:01.643 --> 03:03.675
WE WILL SOON
RISE TO THE SURFACE

03:03.676 --> 03:06.143
AND TAKE OVER
THIS WRETCHED PLANET.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.510
THE TRIP TO THE SURFACE
WILL TAKE HOURS.

03:09.511 --> 03:11.710
LET US SEND
THE PEOPLE OF EARTH

03:11.711 --> 03:14.677
A LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT
OF OUR ARRIVAL.

03:14.678 --> 03:16.477
HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO DO THAT?

03:16.478 --> 03:21.345
THE PANDIMENSIONAL PORTAL
IS ALSO FUNCTIONING NOW.

03:21.346 --> 03:23.879
AND WE WILL ONCE
AGAIN HAVE ACCESS

03:23.880 --> 03:26.514
TO THE WEAPONRY
OF DIMENSION X.

03:26.515 --> 03:31.181
WHICH WE SHALL USE
TO REDUCE ANY RESISTANCE
WE'LL MEET

03:31.182 --> 03:33.315
WHEN WE ARRIVE
ON THE SURFACE.

03:34.649 --> 03:37.082
GENERAL TRAGG.

03:37.083 --> 03:40.350
I AWAIT YOUR COMMANDS,
MY LORD.

03:40.351 --> 03:42.716
THE TIME
IS HERE, TRAGG.

03:42.717 --> 03:47.218
SOON THIS
MISERABLE PLANET
WILL BE OURS.

03:47.219 --> 03:48.951
BUT FIRST,
I WANT YOU

03:48.952 --> 03:52.986
TO SEND ME
THE MINIMIZER.

03:52.987 --> 03:55.118
AT ONCE, MY LORD.

03:57.355 --> 04:00.187
WHAT IS
THIS MINIMIZER?

04:00.188 --> 04:03.454
A DEVICE
OF MY OWN DESIGN.

04:03.455 --> 04:06.655
IT WILL MAKE CERTAIN
THAT ALL OUR PROBLEMS

04:06.656 --> 04:09.489
ARE LITTLE ONES. HE HE HE!

04:09.490 --> 04:11.123
I DON'T GET IT.

04:11.124 --> 04:12.290
HOW COULD KRANG
AND SHREDDER

04:12.291 --> 04:14.524
GET THE TECHNODROME
MOVING AGAIN?

04:14.525 --> 04:17.023
THEY MUST BE
USING FUEL FROM
THAT MISSILE PLANT

04:17.024 --> 04:19.391
ROCKSTEADY AND BEBOP
BROKE INTO.

04:19.392 --> 04:20.658
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,

04:20.659 --> 04:22.692
IT'S SURE MAKING
A LOT OF NOISE.

04:22.693 --> 04:25.526
I'M PICKING UP HEAVY
SOUND WAVE ACTIVITY.

04:25.527 --> 04:27.359
THAT WAY.

04:29.427 --> 04:32.594
COME ON, TROOPS.
LET'S DO IT!

04:35.895 --> 04:39.362
DUDES,
THIS LOOKS LIKE
A MAJOR SHORTCUT.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.596
HEY, NICE WORK,
LEONARDO.

04:43.597 --> 04:45.497
DID YOU EVER THINK
OF BECOMING A HEART SURGEON?

04:45.498 --> 04:47.063
TURTLE POWER!

04:51.665 --> 04:53.464
HAVE A NICE DAY.

04:54.500 --> 04:58.833
THE MINIMIZER
IS ON THE SURFACE.

04:58.834 --> 05:02.167
NOW TO SEE IF IT CAN
DELIVER AS PROMISED.

05:02.168 --> 05:06.534
OH, IT CAN AND WILL,
I PROMISE YOU.

05:06.535 --> 05:09.868
EVEN BEBOP AND ROCKSTEADY
COULD CONTROL THIS MINIMIZER.

05:09.869 --> 05:12.170
I'M REAL GOOD
AT VIDEO GAMES.

05:12.171 --> 05:16.269
LATER. FIRST WE DO
SOME REAL DAMAGE.

05:28.740 --> 05:32.173
WE'RE BENEATH THE SEWERS NOW
IN THE EARTH'S CRUST.

05:32.174 --> 05:34.640
I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
MENTION CRUSTS.

05:34.641 --> 05:36.974
IT MAKES ME THINK
OF PIZZAS.

05:39.476 --> 05:40.541
DO YOU
HEAR THAT?

05:40.542 --> 05:41.842
WE'RE
GETTING CLOSER.

05:41.843 --> 05:44.010
WELL, IF IT REALLY IS
THE TECHNODROME,

05:44.011 --> 05:46.243
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
TELL THEM TO STOP?

05:46.244 --> 05:48.777
WE'LL HAVE TO GET
INSIDE SOMEHOW
AND SHUT IT DOWN,

05:48.778 --> 05:51.311
BEFORE IT REACHES
THE SURFACE
OF THE EARTH.

05:51.312 --> 05:54.844
STILL THINK YOU'D
LIKE TO BE A TEENAGE
MUTANT NINJA TURTLE?

05:54.845 --> 05:57.579
SIR, THIS IS FLIGHT CONTROL.

05:57.580 --> 06:00.612
WE HAVE A HOSTILE
AIRCRAFT APPROACHING
AT HIGH SPEED.

06:00.613 --> 06:01.813
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

06:01.814 --> 06:03.379
BLAST IT OUT
OF THE SKY!

06:05.348 --> 06:08.114
SIR, WE'RE NOT ABLE
TO STOP IT.

06:12.016 --> 06:14.149
IT'S FIRING
A GREEN RAY AT US.

06:14.150 --> 06:16.382
THE RAY IS SHRINKING US!

06:16.383 --> 06:18.116
WE'RE GETTING
[HIGH PITCHED VOICE]
SMALLER!

06:21.284 --> 06:24.184
Krang:
IT WORKS!
IT WORKED!

06:24.185 --> 06:26.518
SOON, ALL THE ARMIES
OF EARTH

06:26.519 --> 06:28.885
WILL BE COMING UP
A LITTLE SHORT.

06:28.886 --> 06:33.086
UH, YEAH, BUT WHAT
ABOUT THE TURTLES?

06:34.054 --> 06:35.586
IF THEY TRY
TO GET IN OUR WAY,

06:35.587 --> 06:37.254
WE'LL CRUSH THEM!

06:37.255 --> 06:38.787
THE TECHNODROME
WILL SQUASH THEM

06:38.788 --> 06:41.121
IN THEIR SHELLS
LIKE BUGS!

06:43.490 --> 06:45.322
WE'RE REALLY CLOSE NOW.

06:45.323 --> 06:47.022
LOOK AT THOSE READINGS.

06:47.023 --> 06:49.823
WE COULD HAVE
FIGURED THAT OUT
FROM THE NOISE.

06:49.824 --> 06:53.491
MY GUESS IS, IT'S ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT...

06:53.492 --> 06:56.225
WALL-LLLLL!

06:58.593 --> 07:01.525
IT'S GOING TO ROLL
RIGHT OVER US!

07:01.526 --> 07:04.293
WE'LL BE FLATTENED
LIKE TURTLE PIZZAS!

07:04.294 --> 07:06.059
WELL, I GUESS
IF YOU'VE GOT TO GO,

07:06.060 --> 07:08.260
THAT'S THE BEST WAY!

07:16.762 --> 07:18.929
LOOK OUT!
HERE IT COMES!

07:18.930 --> 07:21.996
I'M STUCK.
I CAN'T MOVE.

07:23.832 --> 07:25.963
AS LONG AS IT'S
GOING OUR WAY,

07:25.964 --> 07:27.431
LET'S HITCH A RIDE.

07:34.267 --> 07:36.500
APRIL,
DO YOU READ ME?

07:36.501 --> 07:37.899
THE TECHNODROME'S MOVING!

07:37.900 --> 07:39.766
IT'S HEADING
TOWARD THE SURFACE.

07:39.767 --> 07:41.033
ALERT THE MILITARY,

07:41.034 --> 07:42.400
WARN THE WORLD!

07:42.401 --> 07:46.335
<i>OH, AND CANCEL
MY SUBSCRIPTION TO
THE NINJA NEWSLETTER.</i>

07:46.336 --> 07:47.936
I'M ON IT,
RAPHAEL.

07:47.937 --> 07:50.303
GLEN?

07:50.304 --> 07:51.636
WHAT IS IT, APRIL?

07:51.637 --> 07:54.504
I JUST HEARD
THE TECHNODROME
IS HEADING THIS WAY!

07:54.505 --> 07:56.103
IT IS?

07:56.104 --> 07:57.937
WHAT'S A TECHNODROME?

07:57.938 --> 07:59.738
IT'S SHREDDER'S
BATTLE MACHINE.

07:59.739 --> 08:01.204
IT COULD CRUSH
THE CITY FLAT

08:01.205 --> 08:02.637
IF IT ISN'T STOPPED!

08:02.638 --> 08:05.305
PLEASE, GLEN,
THERE'S NOT
A MOMENT TO LOSE!

08:05.306 --> 08:09.073
WELL...ALL RIGHT!
I'LL CALL MY CONTACTS
IN THE MILITARY,

08:09.074 --> 08:11.339
BUT THIS HAS
BETTER BE REAL.

08:11.340 --> 08:12.506
AND I'LL GET
THE NEWS VAN.

08:12.507 --> 08:14.641
WE'VE GOT TO
WARN THE WORLD
ABOUT THIS.

08:17.608 --> 08:21.142
HANG ON, YOU GUYS.
ALL TOGETHER NOW.

08:24.377 --> 08:26.943
GUYS, THIS WAY, MAYBE?

08:27.944 --> 08:29.143
ENTRANCE?

08:29.144 --> 08:31.777
KRANG EXPECTS US
TO FALL FOR THAT?

08:35.746 --> 08:37.912
I GUESS HE DOES.

08:37.913 --> 08:41.214
DUDES, LOOK AT ALL
THOSE WHEELS.

08:41.215 --> 08:43.580
THERE'S ONLY
2 PLACES WE CAN
SHUT DOWN

08:43.581 --> 08:45.647
THIS OVERSIZED
RUST BUCKET.

08:45.648 --> 08:47.348
WE'LL SPLIT INTO
2 TEAMS.

08:47.349 --> 08:49.647
RAPHAEL AND I WILL HIT
THE ENGINE ROOM.

08:49.648 --> 08:51.549
RIGHT.
MICHELANGELO,

08:51.550 --> 08:53.516
YOU AND I WILL TAKE
THE RELAY ROOM.

08:53.517 --> 08:57.249
BINGO.
WE'LL DELAY
THE RELAY.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.883
MAY I SUGGEST
WE TAKE SOME WHEELS?

08:59.884 --> 09:02.985
TURTLE POWER!
TURTLE POWER!

09:07.086 --> 09:09.952
OPERATOR, GET ME
FORT MACKINTOSH.

09:09.953 --> 09:11.887
THIS IS
FORT MACKINTOSH.

09:11.888 --> 09:13.786
WE'RE BUSY
WITH A CODE RED
EMERGENCY.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.053
SO PLEASE LEAVE
YOUR NAME AND NUMBER

09:15.054 --> 09:16.053
AT THE SOUND
OF THE BEEP.

09:16.054 --> 09:17.954
OH, GREAT!

09:17.955 --> 09:19.888
APRIL, COME IN, APRIL.

09:19.889 --> 09:21.689
DROP WHATEVER
YOU'RE DOING

09:21.690 --> 09:23.721
AND GET TO
FORT MACKINTOSH, PRONTO!

09:23.722 --> 09:25.956
WHAT ABOUT
THE TECHNODROME?

09:25.957 --> 09:28.990
FORGET IT.
THIS IS BIGGER
THAN THE TECHNODROME.

09:28.991 --> 09:32.524
BELIEVE ME,
NOTHING'S BIGGER
THAN THE TECHNODROME.

09:32.525 --> 09:34.224
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

09:36.793 --> 09:40.158
WE COULD SEARCH
THIS KING-SIZED
RAT MAZE FOR DAYS

09:40.159 --> 09:41.826
AND NOT FIND ANYTHING.

09:41.827 --> 09:44.126
THE ENGINE ROOM
MUST BE ON
THE LOWER LEVELS.

09:44.127 --> 09:45.860
WE'VE JUST GOT
TO KEEP SEARCHING.

09:47.828 --> 09:49.461
WHAT'S THE HECK
IS THIS PLACE?

09:49.462 --> 09:52.094
LOOKS LIKE THE THERMAL
REGULATING CHAMBER.

09:52.095 --> 09:53.295
RIGHT. OF COURSE.

09:53.296 --> 09:55.762
YOU KNOW,
SOONER OR LATER,

09:55.763 --> 09:58.230
SHREDHEAD'S GOING
TO GET HIP TO US.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.496
HOW THE DEVIL
DID THE TURTLES
GET IN HERE?

10:00.497 --> 10:02.097
WE'VE GOT
TO STOP THEM.

10:02.098 --> 10:04.797
GREAT. YOU KEEP
THE MINIMIZER RUNNING.

10:04.798 --> 10:06.465
LET ROCKSTEADY, BEBOP,

10:06.466 --> 10:09.066
AND SOME FOOT SOLDIERS
TAKE CARE OF THEM.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.366
YOU HEARD HIM.

10:10.367 --> 10:12.566
GO ANNIHILATE
THOSE REPTILES!

10:12.567 --> 10:14.232
UH, RIGHT, BOSS.

10:15.533 --> 10:18.867
WE GOT THEM
SHELLBACKS RIGHT
WHERE WE WANT THEM.

10:18.868 --> 10:23.468
YEAH, BUT AIN'T WE
HAD THEM THERE BEFORE?

10:23.469 --> 10:27.536
AND JUST IN CASE
THOSE ZIPHEADS FAIL,

10:27.537 --> 10:29.835
I HAVE A FEW
MORE SURPRISES

10:29.836 --> 10:32.804
IN STORE
FOR THE TURTLES.

10:32.805 --> 10:35.504
THERE'S
FORT MACKINTOSH.

10:35.505 --> 10:39.138
THE TROOPS ARE SHOOTING
AT THAT FLYING WING.
I SEE IT!

10:39.139 --> 10:41.739
THAT GREEN RAY
IS SHRINKING
THE ENTIRE FORT!

10:41.740 --> 10:43.372
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

10:43.373 --> 10:45.673
I'VE GOT
TO FOLLOW THAT THING.

10:45.674 --> 10:49.007
IT'S GUILTY OF...THEFT
OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY!

10:49.008 --> 10:52.674
HOW ON EARTH
ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO FIND ANYTHING

10:52.675 --> 10:55.175
IN THIS OVERSIZED
HOT DOG STAND?

10:55.176 --> 10:57.408
WE JUST HAVE TO LOOK
BEHIND EVERY DOOR

10:57.409 --> 10:59.175
TILL WE DISCOVER
THE ENGINE ROOM.

11:01.776 --> 11:03.176
WRONG DOOR!!

11:06.112 --> 11:09.044
THEY CAN'T HAVE MISSILES
BEHIND EVERY DOOR.

11:09.045 --> 11:10.378
THAT'S TRUE,
LEONARDO,

11:10.379 --> 11:12.278
SOME OF THEM HAVE...

11:12.279 --> 11:13.646
FOOT SOLDIERS!

11:17.947 --> 11:20.180
NOW WHAT THE HECK
IS THIS PLACE?

11:20.181 --> 11:23.314
IT'S SOME KIND
OF MANUFACTURING PLANT.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.114
YEAH, BUT UNLESS
WE CAN GET IT

11:25.115 --> 11:26.581
TO MANUFACTURE
AN ENGINE ROOM,

11:26.582 --> 11:28.148
I AM OUT OF HERE.

11:28.149 --> 11:30.183
IT WON'T
BE THAT EASY.

11:30.184 --> 11:34.583
I PLAN TO AMUSE MYSELF
WITH YOU FOR A WHILE.

11:34.584 --> 11:36.250
WE'RE GOING
TO NEED EXPLOSIVES

11:36.251 --> 11:38.317
TO PUT THE ENGINE ROOM
OUT OF COMMISSION.

11:38.318 --> 11:40.850
THIS MIGHT BE THE PLACE
TO FIND THEM.

11:40.851 --> 11:43.485
FINE, BUT LET'S DON'T
HANG AROUND.

11:43.486 --> 11:46.285
I DISTINCTLY SAID WE'RE
NOT HANGING AROUND.

11:49.020 --> 11:51.320
RAPHAEL?

11:51.321 --> 11:52.887
HEY, COOL IT, BUD,

11:52.888 --> 11:54.221
I'M NOT
AN AUTO CHASSIS.

11:55.322 --> 11:58.822
TURTLE TARTAR IS NOT
MY FAVORITE DISH.

11:58.823 --> 12:02.322
WE HAVE BEEN
ALL OVER THIS
LEVEL, DUDE.

12:02.323 --> 12:05.156
AND THE RELAY
ROOM IS, LIKE,
NOWHERE.

12:05.157 --> 12:06.856
THEN WE'LL HAVE
TO HEAD UP.

12:06.857 --> 12:09.157
THERE'S AN ELEVATOR.

12:14.226 --> 12:16.259
DONATELLO, IT'S APRIL.

12:16.260 --> 12:17.726
WHERE ARE YOU,
APRIL?

12:17.727 --> 12:19.226
FORT MACKINTOSH.

12:19.227 --> 12:20.793
THERE'S A WEIRD MACHINE
UP HERE

12:20.794 --> 12:22.593
THAT SHRUNK
THE ENTIRE BASE.

12:22.594 --> 12:24.627
IT MUST BE
KRANG'S WORK.

12:24.628 --> 12:25.994
WITH THE TECHNODROME
REPOWERED,

12:25.995 --> 12:28.827
HE CAN PULL
ANYTHING THROUGH
THAT DIMENSIONAL PORTAL.

12:28.828 --> 12:30.996
YOU KEEP FOLLOWING
THAT THING, APRIL.

12:30.997 --> 12:32.262
DON'T WORRY,
I INTEND TO.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.463
OOH,
THIRD FLOOR.

12:35.464 --> 12:41.030
LINGERIE,
EVENING WEAR,
AND TURTLE STOMPING.

12:41.031 --> 12:43.431
BEBOP!
ROCKSTEADY!

12:43.432 --> 12:46.399
NICE OF YOU WIMPS
TO SHOW UP.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.599
WE WERE IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD...

12:50.100 --> 12:52.333
SO WE THOUGHT
WE'D DROP IN.

12:53.801 --> 12:56.800
SAY GOODBYE, GEEKS.

12:56.801 --> 12:59.234
WHAT A TOTALLY
RUDE DUDE.

12:59.235 --> 13:01.468
HEY, WATCH IT!

13:01.469 --> 13:04.136
DON'T BEND
THE MERCHANDISE.

13:04.137 --> 13:06.602
DON'T WORRY,
THERE'LL BE
ANOTHER CAR ALONG

13:06.603 --> 13:08.102
IN A MINUTE.

13:10.838 --> 13:13.237
THEY SURE AIN'T
ACTING NICE,

13:13.238 --> 13:15.638
CONSIDERING
THEY'RE GUESTS.

13:15.639 --> 13:18.972
YEAH, I WONDER
WHO INVITED THEM.

13:18.973 --> 13:21.572
MICHELANGELO,
WE FOUND IT!

13:21.573 --> 13:23.206
THE RELAY ROOM.

13:23.207 --> 13:25.873
THEY FOUND IT!
WE MUST STOP THEM!

13:25.874 --> 13:28.208
YOU OPERATE
THE MINIMIZER.

13:28.209 --> 13:30.541
I'LL HANDLE
THOSE TURTLES.

13:34.243 --> 13:37.742
IN FACT,
I'LL MANHANDLE THEM.

13:40.244 --> 13:42.843
I GUESS THIS IS
MY PAYBACK

13:42.844 --> 13:44.911
FOR BEING
SUCH A CUTUP.

13:44.912 --> 13:46.845
I'M ON MY WAY.

13:48.879 --> 13:52.079
WHOO! I OWE
YOU ONE, BUDDY.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.879
NO PROBLEM.
NOW ALL WE HAVE

13:53.880 --> 13:56.246
TO WORRY ABOUT
IS THE--

13:56.247 --> 13:58.347
FOOT SOLDIERS!

13:58.348 --> 14:00.847
IF WE TAKE OUT
A FEW OF THESE ELECTRODES,

14:00.848 --> 14:03.581
THE WHOLE TECHNODROME
WILL SHUT DOWN.

14:04.883 --> 14:06.082
KRANG?

14:06.083 --> 14:10.050
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TANGLE WITH ME FIRST.

14:10.051 --> 14:12.484
AND I DO MEAN TANGLE.

14:12.485 --> 14:16.451
UH-OH! WE'VE BEEN
BOLO BLITZED.

14:18.051 --> 14:21.519
WHAT? IT'S STOPPING
OVER AT THAT PARK.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.286
NOW IT'S UNLOADING
THOSE MINIATURIZED
ARMY BASES.

14:24.287 --> 14:26.786
WHAT ON EARTH
IS IT DOING NOW?

14:26.787 --> 14:29.686
UH-OH!
I'M SORRY I ASKED!

14:29.687 --> 14:31.654
I'D LIKE TO LOSE
A FEW POUNDS,

14:31.655 --> 14:33.720
BUT NOT THAT WAY!

14:35.589 --> 14:37.389
OH, NO!

14:41.090 --> 14:44.556
IT'S A GOOD THING
I ALWAYS WEAR
MY SEAT BELTS.

14:44.557 --> 14:46.323
NOW WHAT?

14:48.392 --> 14:52.191
AT LAST,
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

14:52.192 --> 14:55.659
THE TECHNODROME
ARISES!

15:00.028 --> 15:02.394
THAT'S GOT TO BE
THE TECHNODROME,

15:02.395 --> 15:04.328
AND IT'S HEADED
THIS WAY!

15:06.462 --> 15:08.661
THE DOOR WON'T OPEN!

15:22.232 --> 15:25.598
AT LAST, OUR DAY
OF TRIUMPH IS UPON US.

15:25.599 --> 15:30.666
NOW, TO CRUSH
THE PUNY CITIZENS OF EARTH!

15:30.667 --> 15:33.100
I CAN'T OPEN IT.

15:33.101 --> 15:36.934
LEONARDO,
DONATELLO, HELP!

15:42.770 --> 15:44.569
GEE, WE'D LIKE TO,

15:44.570 --> 15:47.137
BUT WE'RE ALL TIED UP
RIGHT NOW.

15:47.138 --> 15:49.004
THE TECHNODROME IS
ON THE SURFACE.

15:49.005 --> 15:50.004
IT'S HEADED
STRAIGHT FOR ME

15:50.005 --> 15:52.438
AND THOSE SHRUNKEN
ARMY BASES.

15:52.439 --> 15:55.705
TIME TO CHECK OUT OF
THIS METAL MOTEL, DUDE.

15:55.706 --> 15:58.906
YOU WISH TO GO
SOMEWHERE, TURTLES?

15:58.907 --> 16:01.707
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO DRIVE YOU.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.141
HOW MANY ARE THERE?

16:07.142 --> 16:08.641
ABOUT 20.

16:08.642 --> 16:10.409
10 TO 1 ODDS, HUH?

16:10.410 --> 16:12.642
I ALWAYS LIKED
LONG SHOTS.

16:12.643 --> 16:13.909
BUT SUDDENLY
THE FAVORITES

16:13.910 --> 16:15.908
ARE STARTING TO
LOOK PRETTY GOOD.

16:19.378 --> 16:21.744
THE DOOR STILL WON'T OPEN!

16:21.745 --> 16:23.878
DON'T YOU JUST HATE IT
WHEN THAT HAPPENS?

16:23.879 --> 16:25.711
HEY, BRAIN MAN,

16:25.712 --> 16:27.578
HOW ABOUT
FIGHTING FAIR?

16:27.579 --> 16:30.979
FIGHT FAIR? NAW...

16:32.048 --> 16:33.280
LOOK OUT!

16:35.581 --> 16:36.647
WE'VE GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE

16:36.648 --> 16:37.847
AND HELP APRIL.

16:37.848 --> 16:40.214
YOU TWO WILL BE TAKING
A TRIP,

16:40.215 --> 16:45.015
BUT THE DIRECTION
WILL BE STRAIGHT DOWN.

16:46.650 --> 16:51.250
MICHELANGELO, LET'S TAKE
THIS TURKEY DOWN.

16:51.251 --> 16:54.284
<i>TUBULOSO IDEA,
COMPADRE.</i>

16:54.285 --> 16:56.384
UP WE GO...

16:56.385 --> 16:57.418
WHAT?

16:57.419 --> 16:59.352
AND DOWN
WE COME.

16:59.353 --> 17:02.652
STAND STILL
SO I CAN POUND YOU.

17:06.854 --> 17:08.654
GET HIM,
DONATELLO.

17:08.655 --> 17:11.487
IT'S TIME TO SCRAMBLE
A FEW CIRCUITS.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.221
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

17:13.222 --> 17:17.321
NO! AAH! STOP ME!

17:17.323 --> 17:19.388
STOP YOU?
I'M GOING
TO ENTER YOU

17:19.390 --> 17:21.656
IN A
BREAKDANCING
CONTEST.

17:25.058 --> 17:27.358
HE'S CERTAINLY GOT
A NATURAL SENSE
OF RHYTHM.

17:27.358 --> 17:29.658
YEAH. WITH A LITTLE
REPROGRAMMING,

17:29.659 --> 17:32.158
HE COULD
BE A MAJOR
PARTY ANIMAL.

17:35.094 --> 17:36.959
SHREDDER,
COME QUICKLY!

17:36.960 --> 17:38.760
I NEED YOU!

17:40.228 --> 17:42.994
HEADS UP, GUYS.
THIS BABY IS ON THE SURFACE

17:42.995 --> 17:44.827
AND APRIL'S IN DEEP TROUBLE.

17:44.828 --> 17:47.294
MEET US WHERE
WE CAME IN.

17:47.295 --> 17:48.695
HEADS UP.

17:53.165 --> 17:55.397
TIME FOR SOME RANDOM
REPROGRAMMING.

17:55.398 --> 17:56.831
I HOPE THIS WORKS.

17:56.832 --> 17:58.365
AND I HOPE
REAL SOON.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.566
IT'S WORKING!

18:04.567 --> 18:07.733
HEY, LOOK,
IT'S RAINING
FOOT SOLDIERS.

18:07.734 --> 18:09.000
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT?

18:09.001 --> 18:11.366
THE WEATHER BUREAU
PREDICTED SUNNY AND MILD.

18:20.036 --> 18:22.436
IF WE
DON'T MOVE FAST,

18:22.437 --> 18:24.469
APRIL AND THOSE
ARMY BASES

18:24.470 --> 18:28.037
ARE GOING TO BE
LUMPY OATMEAL.

18:28.038 --> 18:29.871
MICHELANGELO,
YOU ALWAYS DID HAVE

18:29.872 --> 18:31.339
A TOUCH OF THE POET.

18:31.340 --> 18:32.605
AND LOOK!

18:32.606 --> 18:34.272
THAT MUST BE
THE FLYING OBJECT

18:34.273 --> 18:36.372
THAT SHRANK
THE ARMY BASES.

18:36.373 --> 18:38.740
THIS IS OUR ONLY WAY
TO GET TO IT.

18:38.741 --> 18:40.940
HANG ON FOR BLAST-OFF!

18:47.076 --> 18:51.042
WE'RE ABOUT TO BECOME
TINY TEENAGE TURTLES.

18:51.043 --> 18:53.075
NOT IF WE JUMP.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.277
HANG ON, FELLAS.

18:56.278 --> 18:59.544
APRIL'S ABOUT
TO BE FLATTENED
BY THE TECHNODROME!

18:59.545 --> 19:02.311
IS ANYONE THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

19:02.312 --> 19:04.410
I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.878
HMM... LET'S SEE...

19:07.513 --> 19:08.779
I'LL BE OK.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.346
THE TURTLES
ALWAYS RESCUE ME

19:10.347 --> 19:11.880
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

19:11.881 --> 19:13.579
OH! WHAT AM
I SAYING?

19:13.580 --> 19:15.047
THIS IS
THE LAST MINUTE!

19:18.249 --> 19:19.747
I DON'T NEED
THE TURTLES,

19:19.748 --> 19:21.415
I NEED
A DRY CLEANER.

19:21.416 --> 19:23.615
HURRY UP,
DONATELLO.

19:23.616 --> 19:25.649
I THINK
I FOUND IT.

19:26.985 --> 19:28.883
NOW LET'S GIVE
THOSE CREEPOZOIDS

19:28.884 --> 19:30.951
A TASTE OF THEIR
OWN MEDICINE.

19:30.952 --> 19:33.418
OH, THAT'S
MUCH BETTER.

19:33.419 --> 19:35.285
GEE, I DON'T KNOW,

19:35.286 --> 19:38.152
YOU HAD SOME
PRETTY GOOD MOVES
BEFORE.

19:38.153 --> 19:40.419
NOW WE CAN
GET BACK TO--

19:40.420 --> 19:42.120
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:42.121 --> 19:45.920
THOSE TURTLES!
THEY HAVE THE MINIMIZER!

19:48.289 --> 19:50.521
HELP! HELP!

19:52.256 --> 19:54.922
OH, NO.
WE'RE SHRINKING!

19:54.923 --> 19:56.722
WE'RE SHRINKING!

19:56.723 --> 20:00.223
WE DID IT. WE SHRUNK
THE TECHNODROME.

20:00.224 --> 20:03.057
SORRY, FELLAS.

20:03.058 --> 20:05.891
NOW IS PROBABLY
THE WRONG TIME TO ASK,

20:05.892 --> 20:08.292
ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN LAND THIS THING?

20:08.293 --> 20:10.026
HEY, HOW HARD
CAN IT BE?

20:11.994 --> 20:13.593
NOT AS HARD
AS THE GROUND.

20:13.594 --> 20:16.327
THE TECHNODROME!
IT'S GETTING AWAY!

20:17.728 --> 20:19.527
WE'VE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE!

20:19.528 --> 20:21.861
TO THE HOLE!
QUICKLY!

20:26.463 --> 20:29.763
WELL, SO MUCH
FOR THE TECHNODROME.

20:29.764 --> 20:32.597
YEAH, IT PROBABLY ROLLED
ALL THE WAY BACK

20:32.598 --> 20:34.364
TO WHERE IT CAME FROM.

20:37.732 --> 20:40.231
STICK WITH ME,
YOU SAID.

20:40.232 --> 20:42.799
I'LL MAKE YOU
A BIG MAN.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.599
SOME BIG MAN!

20:44.600 --> 20:46.533
RELAX, WILL YOU?

20:46.534 --> 20:48.700
I DESIGNED
THE MINIMIZER

20:48.701 --> 20:52.167
AND I CAN UNDO
THE EFFECTS
OF ITS RAYS.

20:54.869 --> 20:58.403
NOW, TO GET
THOSE TURTLES!

20:58.404 --> 21:00.936
GIVE THIS GIZMO
TO THE ARMY, APRIL.

21:00.937 --> 21:02.403
WITH THE MODIFICATIONS
I'VE MADE TO IT,

21:02.404 --> 21:03.836
THEY SHOULD
BE ABLE TO RESTORE

21:03.837 --> 21:05.670
ALL THE BASES
TO NORMAL.

21:05.671 --> 21:07.271
SURE THING,
DONATELLO.

21:07.272 --> 21:08.538
TIME TO GO, TEAM.

21:10.238 --> 21:12.538
I'D FEEL
A WHOLE LOT BETTER

21:12.539 --> 21:14.840
IF THE TECHNODROME
HADN'T GOTTEN AWAY.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.139
YEAH, WE COULD HAVE
HAD IT BRONZED

21:17.140 --> 21:19.106
AND HUNG IT
ON THE TURTLE VAN
MIRROR.

21:19.107 --> 21:20.640
WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW
KRANG AND SHREDDER

21:20.641 --> 21:22.074
CAN'T DO ANY DAMAGE.

21:22.075 --> 21:23.808
THEY'RE ONLY 4" TALL.

21:23.809 --> 21:26.108
RIGHT.
IN THEIR CONDITION,

21:26.109 --> 21:28.975
THEY COULD BARELY CONQUER
A MINIATURE GOLF COURSE.

21:28.976 --> 21:31.943
SPEAKING OF MINIATURE
GOLF COURSES,

21:31.944 --> 21:33.477
THERE'S ONE IN THIS
PART OF TOWN

21:33.478 --> 21:35.477
THAT MAKES THESE
LITTLE GREEN PIZZAS

21:35.478 --> 21:37.177
WITH TINY
LITTLE FLAGS,

21:37.178 --> 21:39.544
AND MARSHMALLOWS
FOR GOLF BALLS.
