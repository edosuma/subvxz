GAMBLING DAN
WANTS TO KNOW

00:29.600 --> 00:30.600
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE,
HUNTER.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.600
10 BUCKS.

00:31.600 --> 00:32.900
10 BUCKS.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.300
10 BUCKS.

00:35.367 --> 00:37.400
LET ME STUDY YOUR FACE.

00:38.467 --> 00:40.967
HE'S STUDYING
YOUR FACE.

00:40.967 --> 00:44.600
WHAT DO YOU SEE,
GAMBLING DAN?

00:44.600 --> 00:45.967
HE GOT NOTHING.

00:45.967 --> 00:47.934
YOU GOT NOTHING,
YOU LOSER.

00:47.934 --> 00:49.867
LET'S SEE
YOUR CARDS.
TURN 'EM OVER.

00:49.867 --> 00:51.600
3 KINGS.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.100
OH, NO,
GAMBLING DAN.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.233
THIS HAS NEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE.

00:56.300 --> 00:57.800
WOW, NICE HAND, HUNTER.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.367
MAYBE I DID MISREAD YOU.

00:59.367 --> 01:00.300
THANKS, DAN.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.367
YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:01.367 --> 01:02.734
YOU STILL LOSE.
FLUSH.

01:02.734 --> 01:04.934
BUT I LIKE THE WAY
YOU PLAY.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.400
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD
HANG OUT MORE.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.467
YEAH, I LIKE YOU
TOO, SHAWNY.

01:07.467 --> 01:08.600
I WAS ROOTING
FOR YA.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.200
THANKS, LOUIE.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.600
SO, UH, MAYBE YOU'LL
JOIN US LATER AT CLEAVÁGE.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.300
YEAH, I'LL SEE
IF I'M FREE.

01:18.700 --> 01:19.834
WHAT'S THIS?

01:19.834 --> 01:23.100
MY BEST FRIEND AND ROOMMATE
HOSTING A POKER GAME

01:23.100 --> 01:24.900
IN OUR ROOM WITHOUT ME?

01:24.900 --> 01:26.100
OH, HEY,
IT'S THE MAJOR.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.500
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
WITH YOUR VIRGIN
SUPPORT GROUP.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.867
YEAH, WELL, THE OTHER
GUY DROPPED OUT.

01:30.867 --> 01:31.900
NICE.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.834
SO, UH, SEE YOU AT 7:00
ALL RIGHT, SHAWNY?

01:33.834 --> 01:35.500
AND DON'T BRING NOBODY.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.033
7:00? WHAT'S AT 7:00,
SHAWNY?

01:40.033 --> 01:42.700
UH, NOTHING. BUNCH OF US
ARE GONNA GO TO A CLUB.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.100
REALLY? AND I SUPPOSE

01:44.100 --> 01:46.400
BUNCH OF US DIDN'T THINK
TO INVITE ME EITHER.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.467
WELL, I FIGURED YOU
WERE BUSY WITH TOPANGA.

01:48.467 --> 01:51.734
WELL, PAL, IT JUST SO
HAPPENS I'M FREE TONIGHT.

01:51.734 --> 01:52.834
TOPANGA'S BUSY.

01:52.834 --> 01:55.734
SEE? EVERYTHING YOU DO
IS BASED ON TOPANGA.

01:55.734 --> 01:57.367
HEY, I'M ENGAGED.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.000
I KNOW. SOMETIMES
I WONDER IF THAT RING'S

01:59.000 --> 02:00.367
NOT THROUGH YOUR NOSE.

02:00.367 --> 02:02.467
NO, IT'S RIGHT HERE, PAL.

02:02.467 --> 02:03.834
BUT PERHAPS
ONE OF MY FRIENDS

02:03.834 --> 02:05.800
IS SEVERELY JEALOUS
OF WHAT I HAVE WITH HER.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.600
NO, I'M NOT JEALOUS,
CORY.

02:07.600 --> 02:08.767
I'LL BE HONEST
WITH YOU, OK?

02:08.767 --> 02:10.300
WHENEVER I'M DOING
SOMETHING WITH THE GUYS,

02:10.300 --> 02:13.000
AND I SAY, "HEY, HOW
'BOUT CORY COMES ALONG?"

02:13.000 --> 02:14.100
GAMBLING DAN SAYS,

02:14.100 --> 02:16.767
"NO, NOT CORY. HE'S
MARRIED, HE'S DEAD."

02:16.767 --> 02:19.767
OH, WHAT DO I CARE WHAT
GAMBLING DAN THINKS?

02:19.767 --> 02:21.000
WHY DOES HE CALL ME
THE MAJOR?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.300
IT STANDS FOR
MAJOR WUSS.

02:22.300 --> 02:25.000
HE SAYS IF THERE WAS
A <i>WHIPPED </i>MAGAZINE,

02:25.000 --> 02:26.400
YOU'D BE THE CENTERFOLD.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.767
OK, FIRST OF ALL, THERE
IS A <i>WHIPPED </i>MAGAZINE.

02:29.767 --> 02:31.934
I DIDN'T SUBSCRIBE,
SOMEHOW THEY FOUND ME.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.767
YOU TELL HIM THAT.

02:33.767 --> 02:36.700
YEAH, I'LL TELL HIM THAT
TONIGHT AT CLEAVÁGE.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.000
CLUB CLEAVÁGE?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.033
WHERE THE WOMEN PARADE
AROUND IN LITTLE OUTFITS

02:40.033 --> 02:43.400
THAT BARELY COVER THEIR MOST
PRIVATE OF SITUATIONS?

02:43.400 --> 02:44.567
AND ANGELA'S
LETTING YOU GO?

02:44.567 --> 02:46.300
I'M NOT WITH ANGELA
ANYMORE, REMEMBER?

02:46.300 --> 02:47.500
YOU ARE WITH ANGELA.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.233
NO, I'M NOT, YENTL.

02:49.233 --> 02:50.567
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE.

02:50.567 --> 02:51.667
CORY, EVEN IF I WAS,

02:51.667 --> 02:54.300
IF I WANT TO GO
SOMEPLACE, I GO.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.700
WELL, I WANT TO GO, TOO.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.300
AH, CORY MATTHEWS
AT CLEAVÁGE?

02:58.300 --> 02:59.467
YOU BLUSH AT THE BEACH.

02:59.467 --> 03:01.600
SHAWN, LISTEN, I DON'T
WANT TO BE EXCLUDED

03:01.600 --> 03:02.700
FROM ALL THESE THINGS

03:02.700 --> 03:04.200
JUST BECAUSE
I'M ENGAGED.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.500
IT'S NOT THAT. LOOK,

03:05.500 --> 03:06.800
I MEAN, LET'S FACE REALITY.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.400
I BROKE UP WITH ANGELA,
YOU'RE STILL WITH TOPANGA...

03:09.400 --> 03:11.500
WE'RE IN COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS NOW.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.367
I DON'T CARE, OK?

03:13.367 --> 03:16.800
YOU TELL GAMBLING DAN
THE MAJOR IS GOING.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.000
AND WHAT MAY I ASK ARE YOU
GONNA TELL YOUR FIANCE?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
I WILL TELL HER WHAT
I WANT TO TELL HER

03:22.000 --> 03:23.400
WHEN I CHOOSE
TO TELL HER

03:23.400 --> 03:24.934
OR I WILL TELL HER
OR I WON'T.

03:24.934 --> 03:26.567
IT'S ALL UP TO ME.

03:26.567 --> 03:27.667
SO YOU'RE GONNA TELL HER?

03:27.667 --> 03:30.200
IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.133
WHERE YOU GOING?

03:49.133 --> 03:50.200
NOTHING.
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO JUDGE US.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.800
YEAH, WHY ARE YOU ASKING
SO MANY QUESTIONS?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.100
WE'RE NOT HOUNDING YOU
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.700
I'M DOING
A MIDTERM PAPER

03:54.700 --> 03:57.100
ON THE INFLUENCE OF
WOMEN ON MALE BONDING.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.200
THERE ISN'T ANY.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.600
MALES WERE BONDING
ON THIS PLANET

03:59.600 --> 04:01.800
LONG BEFORE
WOMEN EVER ARRIVED.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.200
THIS PAPER'S WORTH
HALF MY GRADE.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.300
I'VE BEEN PRAYING
TO COME UP

04:04.300 --> 04:06.133
WITH A SPECIFIC
CASE THAT I COULD
OBSERVE,

04:06.133 --> 04:07.200
BUT SO FAR
I HAVEN'T.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.934
LOOK, WE'RE JUST
GOING OUT, OK?!

04:08.934 --> 04:10.400
WE'RE MEN DOING
WHAT MEN DO.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.934
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
QUITE FRANKLY,

04:11.934 --> 04:13.600
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF ALL THE SCRUTINY,

04:13.600 --> 04:15.233
THE BADGERING,
THE NIT-PICKING.

04:15.233 --> 04:16.600
IT'S GOTTA STOP.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.100
DON'T ASK US WHEN WE'RE
COMING HOME EITHER,

04:18.100 --> 04:20.300
'CAUSE QUITE FRANKLY,
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.233
YEAH. 'CAUSE WE'RE
IN COLLEGE NOW.

04:22.233 --> 04:23.967
YOU KNOW THAT?
WE'RE IN COLLEGE.

04:23.967 --> 04:25.300
YOU'RE NOT
THE BOSS OF US.

04:25.300 --> 04:26.400
HUH?

04:26.400 --> 04:29.967
NAG, NAG, NAG,
NAG, NAG.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.500
THANK YOU.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.400
WHAT NERVE. TRYING
TO MAKE US FEEL GUILTY
FOR GOING OUT.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.867
I'M TELLING YOU
IT'S THAT FEMALE
INTUITION GARBAGE, MAN.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.200
YOU SEE, THEY SENSE
WHEN A MAN'S ABOUT
TO DO SOMETHING FUN

04:46.200 --> 04:47.600
AND THEY TRY
TO SPOIL IT.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.300
YEAH, WELL, IT AIN'T
GONNA WORK ON US.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.100
NO WAY, J.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.400
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GO.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.300
GET IN.

05:04.567 --> 05:07.500
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T SEE EVERY DAY.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.767
YEAH, LOOK, AN OUTIE.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.200
YOU KNOW, IF THE DOCTOR
HAD JUST TIED A NEATER KNOT--

05:11.200 --> 05:13.934
CORY, CORY, BEFORE
WE GET TO THE GUYS,

05:13.934 --> 05:15.900
COULD YOU AGE UP
ABOUT 30 YEARS?

05:15.900 --> 05:20.000
HEY, LOOK. IT'S
MR. TOPANGA LAWRENCE.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.767
WHAT'S UP,
MAJOR?

05:21.767 --> 05:23.133
YOU'RE NOT NICE.

05:23.133 --> 05:25.567
OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER,
MAJOR, TOO MUCH
ACTION FOR YOU?

05:25.567 --> 05:27.734
YOU DIDN'T GET ENOUGH LOVE
AS A CHILD, DID YOU?

05:27.734 --> 05:29.300
BEAT HIM UP, DAN.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.400
NAW, I'M SURE
HIS WIFE

05:30.400 --> 05:31.400
DOES THAT FOR HIM,
ALREADY.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.500
I'M NOT MARRIED, OK?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.233
YOU SEE THIS?
IT'S AN ENGAGEMENT RING.

05:34.233 --> 05:37.600
I'M ENGAGED.
SO NUTS TO YOU.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.033
YOU'RE NOT HELPING
YOURSELF.

05:39.033 --> 05:41.000
WHAT KIND OF GUY WEARS
AN ENGAGEMENT RING?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I MEAN, COME ON,
WHAT IS THAT?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
CORY'S JUST REALLY
NOT LIKE EVERYBODY
ELSE YOU KNOW.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.033
HE'S UNIQUE.

05:47.033 --> 05:48.400
MARCHES TO THE BEAT
OF A DIFFERENT
DRUMMER.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.133
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

05:50.133 --> 05:52.567
I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE
SAY CRAP I DON'T GET.

05:52.567 --> 05:53.700
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

05:53.700 --> 05:56.467
LISTEN, I DON'T NEED YOU
TO DEFEND ME, SHAWN.

05:56.467 --> 05:59.400
WELL, LOOK, HE'S HERE.
THAT'S A START.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.600
HEY, GUYS.

06:00.600 --> 06:05.000
HEY, YOU'RE NEW HERE,
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU BEFORE.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.934
HA HA. I'D LIKE
A HAMBURGER AND
FRENCH FRIES---

06:07.934 --> 06:08.967
CORY, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

06:08.967 --> 06:09.967
THE CEILING.
WHY?

06:09.967 --> 06:13.400
BECAUSE I'M
UNCOMFORTABLE IS WHY.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.800
HI, HOW YA DOING?

06:15.800 --> 06:17.667
OOH, I THINK SHE
LIKES YOU, MAJOR.

06:17.667 --> 06:18.900
NO, HEH HEH.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.934
SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME. SHE
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ME.

06:21.934 --> 06:23.400
I DO LIKE YOU.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.400
HE'S CUTE, DANNY.
WHERE YOU BEEN HIDING HIM?

06:25.400 --> 06:27.600
HE DOESN'T GET OUT
MUCH. HE'S MARRIED.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.300
[NERVOUS LAUGH]
NO, I'M NOT MARRIED.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.200
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.300
I'M JUST HERE
FOR A HAMBURGER

06:34.300 --> 06:36.400
AND POSSIBLY THE
BEVERAGE OF MY CHOICE.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.934
WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT MARRIED,
WHY ARE YOU WEARING A RING?

06:38.934 --> 06:39.934
IT'S AN ENGAGEMENT
RING.

06:39.934 --> 06:42.100
OH, THIS IS
A BACHELOR PARTY?

06:42.100 --> 06:43.200
NO.
GIRLS!

06:43.200 --> 06:44.200
OH, BOY.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.400
WE GOT A BACHELOR PARTY!
NO.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.300
THE CUTE ONE WITH
THE CURLY HAIR.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.300
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.467
OH, GOSH. OK.
OK, GIRLS.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.500
OK, OK, OK, GIRLS!

06:53.500 --> 06:54.700
THIS ISN'T NECESSARY.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.233
OK, YOU'RE ALL
WONDERFUL AND SPECIAL

06:56.233 --> 06:57.734
IN YOUR OWN
INDIVIDUAL WAYS,

06:57.734 --> 07:00.500
BUT YOU'RE SMOTHERING ME
WITH YOUR--

07:00.500 --> 07:03.367
OH, CLEAVÁGE.

07:03.367 --> 07:05.500
NOW I GET IT.

07:06.667 --> 07:08.967
CORY, ENJOY IT.
IT'S JUST FUN.

07:08.967 --> 07:10.834
YEAH, MAYBE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:10.834 --> 07:13.500
I MEAN, THIS IS NICE.
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
BESIDES, WHAT BAD
COULD HAPPEN?

07:15.500 --> 07:16.800
RIGHT, TOPANGA?

07:17.867 --> 07:20.400
AAH!

07:20.400 --> 07:23.767
ENGAGED. WRONG.
MUST POKE EYES OUT.

07:23.767 --> 07:25.367
NO, NO, CORY,

07:25.367 --> 07:27.800
NO. EYE POKING BAD.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.233
CORY, IF DAN
SEES YOU BAIL,

07:30.233 --> 07:31.567
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU OR I WILL EVER

07:31.567 --> 07:33.934
BE ABLE TO REPAIR
THE DAMAGE DONE
TO YOUR REPUTATION.

07:33.934 --> 07:34.934
SHAWN, MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

07:34.934 --> 07:37.800
MAYBE I AM JUST
MR. TOPANGA LAWRENCE.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.000
CORY, WILL YOU JUST
TAKE THE RING OFF?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.467
WHY?

07:42.467 --> 07:44.400
BECAUSE IT'S
STRANGLING YOU.

07:50.867 --> 07:52.300
GOOD BOY.

07:58.667 --> 07:59.667
NO, NO, YOU KNOW
WHAT, SHAWN?

07:59.667 --> 08:00.500
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

08:00.500 --> 08:01.734
I MEAN, I WANT TO BE
ONE OF THE GUYS,

08:01.734 --> 08:03.133
BUT I GOTTA TAKE
MY RING OFF.

08:03.133 --> 08:04.200
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I BELONG HERE,

08:04.200 --> 08:05.767
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
YOU BELONG HERE,

08:05.767 --> 08:08.200
I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE
ERIC BELONGS HERE.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.967
HEY, NURSE, HOW
'BOUT SOME CHOW?

08:10.967 --> 08:13.734
OK, MAYBE ERIC.

08:13.734 --> 08:15.900
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHY WE THOUGHT WE
HAD TO SNEAK OUT.

08:15.900 --> 08:18.400

08:19.400 --> 08:20.667
UH, YEAH, TO US.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.967
BUT RACHEL WOULD SEE
THIS PLACE AS A SLEAZY,

08:22.967 --> 08:25.367
LOW-LIFE DEN
OF INIQUITY.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.834
HI, COULD I HAVE
A TUNA ON WHITE?

08:27.834 --> 08:29.233
YOU WANT TO CUT THE CRUSTS
OFF THAT FOR ME

08:29.233 --> 08:30.800
AND SERVE IT IN TRIANGLES
THE WAY MY MOMMY DOES?

08:30.800 --> 08:32.033
THANKS, TIFFANY.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.834
SHE'D THINK THIS PLACE
WOULD BE FREQUENTED

08:33.834 --> 08:36.133
BY THE DEGENERATE SCUM
OF THE EARTH, YOU KNOW?

08:36.133 --> 08:37.133
HELLO.

08:37.133 --> 08:39.100
CORY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

08:39.100 --> 08:40.867
WHY? DOES IT STRIKE
YOU AS ODD

08:40.867 --> 08:44.033
THAT ONE SUCH AS I
WOULD BE FOUND IN
A PLACE LIKE THIS?

08:44.033 --> 08:46.500
DOES TOPANGA KNOW
YOU'RE HERE?

08:46.500 --> 08:47.600

08:50.567 --> 08:53.300
RACHEL?
WE DON'T CARE WHAT
RACHEL THINKS, OK?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.500
SHE'S JUST OUR ROOMMATE.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.233
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ASK
A QUESTION LIKE THAT?

08:56.233 --> 08:58.500
WELL, SHE
LOOKS SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.667
HEY, GUYS.

09:00.667 --> 09:03.200

FOR BOTH OF US, COR.

09:07.834 --> 09:10.600

PUT YOU OVER THE HUMP
WITH THE GUYS.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.600
SHAWNY, THIS MAY COME
AS A BOMB SHELL,

09:12.600 --> 09:14.667
BUT THAT GUY DAN
IS A JERK.

09:14.667 --> 09:17.100
WELL, CORY,
JERK IS NORMAL.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.000
THIS IS WHAT SINGLE
GUYS DO IN COLLEGE.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.133
SO THIS IS WHAT YOU
BROKE UP WITH ANGELA FOR,

09:21.133 --> 09:23.100
TO HANG OUT WITH
GUYS LIKE THAT?

09:23.100 --> 09:24.467
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT?

09:24.467 --> 09:27.033
NO, I WANT YOU
TO LET ME LIVE.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.033
I'M MY OWN MAN
NOW, OK?

09:28.033 --> 09:30.100
I DO WHATEVER
I WANT TO DO,

09:30.100 --> 09:31.600
I GO WHEREVER
I WANT TO GO,

09:31.600 --> 09:33.500
AND I DON'T
HAVE TO ANSWER
TO ANYBODY.

09:33.500 --> 09:34.667
WHERE YOU GUYS BEEN?

09:34.667 --> 09:36.834

WELL, HE'LL
DEFINITELY GO AGAIN

09:40.300 --> 09:41.667

A GREAT MOVIE,

09:41.667 --> 09:43.967
AND HE LOVED IT
AND WHAT'S FUNNIER
THAN THOSE MOUSES,

09:43.967 --> 09:45.300
AND WE ALL KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT--

09:45.300 --> 09:46.600
WE WENT TO CLEAVÁGE.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.734
LITTLE PINK PIGS...

09:48.734 --> 09:50.967
YOU SHOULD,
'CAUSE YOU ARE ONE.

09:50.967 --> 09:52.500
OH, COME ON,
DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.967
IT'S JUST
A RESTAURANT.

09:53.967 --> 09:56.300
AND BESIDES, YOU
CAN'T BE MAD AT ME.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.600
HELLO, DRAMA QUEEN,

09:57.600 --> 09:59.500
WE'RE NOT GOING OUT
TOGETHER ANYMORE,
REMEMBER?

09:59.500 --> 10:01.100
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.100
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.667
YOU GO WHERE YOU WANT.

10:03.667 --> 10:06.233
HEY, COME ON. HEY.

10:06.233 --> 10:08.567
CORY, CAN WE GO INSIDE
AND TALK ABOUT THIS?

10:08.567 --> 10:10.000
NO, I'D PREFER
TO TALK OUT HERE

10:10.000 --> 10:12.300
BECAUSE THE LIGHT
IS SO LOVELY.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.600
AND YOU LOOK SO LOVELY,

10:13.600 --> 10:15.800
SO I THINK--I THINK WE'RE
GONNA STAY RIGHT OUT HERE.

10:17.934 --> 10:19.000
OR HERE IS FINE.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
CORY, WHY?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.100
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,

10:21.100 --> 10:23.800
I JUST WANT TO STATE
THAT AS A MAN

10:23.800 --> 10:27.600
I AM ENTITLED TO CERTAIN
RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.834
I UNDERSTAND.

10:28.834 --> 10:32.300
SO AS A MAN, I WENT
WITH OTHER MEN,

10:32.300 --> 10:33.567
AND DID MAN THINGS

10:33.567 --> 10:35.567
BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT
TO BE THOUGHT OF

10:35.567 --> 10:37.400
BY THOSE MEN AS--

10:37.400 --> 10:39.600
HOW DO I PUT
THIS DELICATELY?
WHIPPED?

10:39.600 --> 10:41.800
YOU COULD AT LEAST
LET ME SAY IT.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.400
CORY, I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.200
BUT YOU'RE
DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.000
I UNDERSTAND YOUR NEED
TO BE ONE OF THE GUYS.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.600
THE ONLY THING THAT'S
IMPORTANT TO ME

10:49.600 --> 10:52.600
IS THAT WE ARE ALWAYS
HONEST WITH EACH OTHER, OK?

10:52.600 --> 10:55.133
YOU'RE NOT JUST BEING
UNDERSTANDING NOW,

10:55.133 --> 10:58.100
BUT ACTUALLY
HARBORING BITTERNESS
AND RESENTMENT

10:58.100 --> 10:59.834
THAT'LL FESTER
OVER THE YEARS

10:59.834 --> 11:03.300
UNTIL ONE DAY YOU HACK
ME APART IN MY SLEEP?

11:03.300 --> 11:04.967
NO, CORY, THAT
WOULD BE WRONG.

11:04.967 --> 11:08.233
YEAH, I MEAN,
YOU DON'T GO AROUND
HACKING PEOPLE.

11:08.233 --> 11:09.500
NO, YOU DON'T.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.500
SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.033
YOU THINK OF ME
AS MY OWN MAN,

11:12.033 --> 11:13.600
SO I CAN DO
ANYTHING I WANT?

11:13.600 --> 11:16.400
I TRUST YOU, CORY.
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.033
WELL, WHAT IF
I DON'T WANT TO?

11:18.033 --> 11:19.033
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

11:19.033 --> 11:20.767
GOOD. BECAUSE
THE FOOD IS NO GOOD

11:20.767 --> 11:22.834
AND THE SERVICE
IS JUST CRAZY.

11:22.834 --> 11:24.367
IF YOU THINK THAT'S BEST.

11:24.367 --> 11:25.767
I DO.

11:25.767 --> 11:28.967
NOW COME HERE, HUH?
GIVE ME SOME SUGAR.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.000
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

HE JUST CALLED
ME A PIGEON.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.500
YOU ARE A PIGEON.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.200
THEN IT'S TRUE.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.867
DUDE, YOU WERE
THE MAN TONIGHT.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.800
WHEN THOSE WAITRESSES
ATTACKED YOU...

11:47.800 --> 11:49.100
OK, I WAS JEALOUS.

11:49.100 --> 11:52.300
YOU KNOW, I ADMIT I MUST'VE
HAD YOU PEGGED ALL WRONG.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.367
ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW,

11:53.367 --> 11:55.200
SINCE YOU STOPPED
WEARING THAT STUPID RING.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.400
I GOTTA STOP LOOKING
TO THE PAST.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.200
I NEED TO LOOK
TO THE FUTURE.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.967
AAH!

12:22.000 --> 12:24.700
YOU KNOW, THE FUTURE
IS ALSO NO GOOD.

12:31.934 --> 12:33.600

YOU WERE ALL

12:33.600 --> 12:35.000
UNDERSTANDING AND
MATURE ABOUT THIS,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.700
YOU REALLY THINK CORY'S
NOT GONNA GO BACK
TO THAT PLACE?

12:37.700 --> 12:38.934
I KNOW HE WON'T, ANGELA.

12:38.934 --> 12:41.000

CHOOSE TO WIGGLE
AROUND HALF NAKED,

12:48.500 --> 12:49.767
THERE'LL BE MEN
WHO GO TO SEE THEM.

12:49.767 --> 12:52.367
WOMEN DON'T CHOOSE
TO WORK IN A PLACE
LIKE THAT.

12:52.367 --> 12:55.100
THEY'RE FORCED INTO
IT BY CIRCUMSTANCES.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.867
I WORK THERE.

12:56.867 --> 12:58.200
JOAN, YOU DO?

12:58.200 --> 12:59.600

IS THIS PLACE
REALLY THAT BAD?

13:19.400 --> 13:20.400
IT'S HARMLESS.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.500
I MEAN, THE GIRLS
WEAR MORE

13:21.500 --> 13:23.934

14:10.667 --> 14:13.867

16:52.567 --> 16:55.500
BECAUSE THEY WERE
CALLING ME THE MAJOR.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.233
LISTEN, THERE ARE SOME
PLACES WHERE A GUY GOES

16:58.233 --> 17:00.734
WHERE HE FEELS
UNCOMFORTABLE
WEARING A RING.

17:00.734 --> 17:03.200
AND MOST GUYS DON'T
EVEN WEAR A RING

17:03.200 --> 17:04.400
BEFORE THEY GET MARRIED.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.934
AND EVEN SOME MARRIED
GUYS DON'T WEAR RINGS.

17:06.934 --> 17:09.667
CORY, I NEVER ASKED YOU
TO WEAR AN ENGAGEMENT RING.

17:09.667 --> 17:12.033
YOU SAW MINE AND SAID,
"PRETTY, I WANT ONE."

17:12.033 --> 17:13.734
YEAH, THAT'S BECAUSE
I DIDN'T EXPECT

17:13.734 --> 17:15.033
ALL THE MEN
TO HATE ME FOR IT.

17:15.033 --> 17:16.734
BUT YOU SHOULD
SEE THEM, TOPANGA.

17:16.734 --> 17:17.767
THEY REALLY DO
HATE ME.

17:17.767 --> 17:19.600
I MEAN I STICK OUT
EVERY PLACE

17:19.600 --> 17:20.600
THEY GO TOGETHER.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.600
POKER GAMES,
STEAM BATHS,

17:22.600 --> 17:23.667
COCKFIGHTS.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.100
CORY, DON'T YOU REALIZE
THAT THE PEOPLE

17:25.100 --> 17:27.000
YOU SO DESPERATELY WANT
TO BE ACCEPTED BY

17:27.000 --> 17:29.200
WOULD PROBABLY RATHER
HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE?

17:29.200 --> 17:31.133
WHAT DO I HAVE?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.600
ME.

17:32.600 --> 17:33.600
OH.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.033
I MEAN, SOMEONE
WHO CARES ABOUT THEM.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.500
THAT'S ALL THAT THE RING
IS ABOUT, CORY,

17:37.500 --> 17:40.400
THAT I HAVE SOMEBODY
THAT CARES ABOUT ME.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.567
BUT I CARE ABOUT YOU

17:41.567 --> 17:44.567
WHETHER YOU WANT TO WEAR
THE RING OR YOU DON'T.

17:45.734 --> 17:47.567
IF I WANT TO PLAY POKER,
I'M PLAYING.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.700
GO. PLAY.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.000
AND IF I WANT TO PLAY ME
A LITTLE TOUCH FOOTBALL

17:51.000 --> 17:53.033
ON THE FIELD WITH
THE BOYS, I'M PLAYING.

17:53.033 --> 17:54.300
YOU GO AND RUN REAL HARD.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.834
AND IF I WANT
TO TAKE MY RING OFF--

17:55.834 --> 17:59.834
NO. YOU EITHER WEAR
THE RING OR YOU DON'T.

17:59.834 --> 18:01.567
WHY?

18:01.567 --> 18:04.800
BECAUSE I HAVE
FEELINGS, TOO, CORY.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.734
HEY, MATTHEWS.
POKER GAME. MY ROOM.

18:10.734 --> 18:13.033
DIG THIS, YOU'RE
ACTUALLY INVITED
THIS TIME.

18:13.033 --> 18:14.100
THIS IS GREAT, MAN.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.800
THERE'S 2 POKER GAMES
ON THE SAME DAY

18:15.800 --> 18:16.967
I GET MY ALLOWANCE
CHECK FROM MOM.

18:16.967 --> 18:19.033
YEAH, IRONIC, ISN'T IT?

18:19.033 --> 18:20.100
HEY, SHAWNY.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.133
HEY, COR.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.600
YOU STILL
HANGING OUT
WITH THOSE GUYS?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.734
YEAH, IT'S EITHER
THAT OR SLEEP.

18:24.734 --> 18:25.767
YOU COMING TONIGHT?

18:25.767 --> 18:28.200
YEAH, SAVE ME
A SEAT.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.500
BUT IF I DON'T
SHOW UP,

18:29.500 --> 18:30.867
IT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE I'M HAVING
A BETTER TIME

18:30.867 --> 18:32.500
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.900
GOOD FOR YOU GUYS.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.233
YOU KNOW, SHAWN,

18:41.233 --> 18:44.000
YOU'RE ALWAYS INVITED
TO HANG OUT WITH US.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.200
I KNOW, COR.
