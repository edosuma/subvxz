Copy. 211 in progress.
Shots fired.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.300
Jefferson American Bank.

00:16.302 --> 00:18.590
21701 Armstrong.

00:18.591 --> 00:20.531
Air 14's en route.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.635
Understand security guard
possibly down inside.

00:25.388 --> 00:26.067
Go go.

00:26.691 --> 00:29.395
Listen, I do not know,
I do not know.

00:40.917 --> 00:43.183
Air 14, we got 2 guys running
through the parking lot.

00:43.184 --> 00:43.972
Suspect number one...

00:43.973 --> 00:45.164
He's got brown coveralls.

00:45.165 --> 00:46.293
He's holding a rifle, guys.

00:46.294 --> 00:48.252
Potentially shot a
security guard inside.

00:48.253 --> 00:50.107
Just use caution.

00:50.108 --> 00:51.122
Freeze!

00:52.747 --> 00:54.027
Okay, I got officers
in foot pursuit.

00:54.028 --> 00:55.195
Officers are in foot pursuit.

00:55.196 --> 00:56.588
I got a northbound on Edison

00:56.589 --> 00:58.532
approaching Douglas
in foot pursuit.

00:59.452 --> 01:00.459
Gunfire! Gunfire!

01:00.460 --> 01:01.884
Officer needs help!
Officer needs help!

01:01.885 --> 01:03.652
I'm on Edison,
coming up to Douglas!

01:03.653 --> 01:05.299
Officer needs help! Shots fired!

01:05.300 --> 01:06.420
I lost them in the trees.

01:06.421 --> 01:08.415
Partner, get me around there.
Get me around. Get me around.

01:09.604 --> 01:10.986
Okay, okay, I got them again.
I got them again.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.381
They're running eastbound
on the south side.

01:12.382 --> 01:13.604
The white building right here.

01:13.605 --> 01:15.071
yeah, right in front of you,

01:15.072 --> 01:16.189
the brown coveralls
with the rifle, guys.

01:16.190 --> 01:17.678
Use caution.
He's already fired once.

01:18.519 --> 01:20.408
Black and white in the parking lot,
that's them in front of you.

01:20.409 --> 01:22.996
Brown coveralls... That's your suspect.
There he is. There he is.

01:23.030 --> 01:24.632
And more shots fired,
guys! Additional shots fired!

01:24.666 --> 01:26.703
Officers need help!
Officers need help!

01:26.704 --> 01:28.025
Southeast corner.

01:30.145 --> 01:31.613
Second vehicle,
right there in front of you.

01:31.648 --> 01:32.481
He's going into the building.

01:32.482 --> 01:34.387
I got them going into the
building the southeast corner.

01:34.388 --> 01:36.080
Stand by. Stand by.

01:36.081 --> 01:37.675
Get me around, partner.
Get me around.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.644
All officers...

01:40.645 --> 01:42.620
Possible hostages.
Watch your fire.

01:45.042 --> 01:47.067
Thank you for calling
Fantasy Kitchens,

01:47.068 --> 01:49.727
your family's first choice
for quality materials.

01:49.728 --> 01:50.350
A fantasy kitchen spe...

01:50.385 --> 01:52.254
I've been trying to reach
them for two hours now.

01:52.289 --> 01:53.825
It seems like they're
screening their calls.

01:53.859 --> 01:56.911
Thank you,
and have a fantastic day.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.733
Hey, this is Steve Hayward
of the L.A.P.D. again.

01:59.734 --> 02:01.464
Please pick up the phone, guys.

02:01.465 --> 02:04.036
I want to make sure everyone
gets through this in one piece.

02:04.070 --> 02:05.505
Thank you for calling
fantasy kitchens...

02:05.540 --> 02:06.741
It's been three hours.

02:06.775 --> 02:07.842
How long can they
hold up in there?

02:07.877 --> 02:10.514
We could send in a
robot with a cellphone.

02:10.548 --> 02:11.549
A fantasy kitchen specialist

02:11.550 --> 02:13.051
will return your call
as soon as possible.

02:13.085 --> 02:15.622
Thank you, and have a
fantastic day. Agent Howard.

02:16.138 --> 02:17.853
All right, listen, guys.
Don't hang up.

02:17.854 --> 02:18.955
Let's talk this thing out.

02:18.989 --> 02:20.123
My apologies to the FBI,

02:20.158 --> 02:21.726
but this is no longer
just a bank robbery.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.028
They killed a security guard.

02:23.063 --> 02:25.098
Yeah, we heard.
How many suspects in the store?

02:26.278 --> 02:26.964
Two.

02:29.164 --> 02:30.489
Well, we'd like to
speak with them,

02:30.490 --> 02:31.926
you know, alive?

02:31.927 --> 02:33.372
I can help you if you let me.

02:33.373 --> 02:36.027
Maybe we could arrange that if
they'd pick up the phone. Guys.

02:36.563 --> 02:37.671
Yeah, we're ready to give up.

02:37.672 --> 02:38.783
We're out of ammo,

02:38.784 --> 02:39.976
s-so no more shooting.

02:40.457 --> 02:41.768
We're gonna send people out front.

02:41.769 --> 02:42.696
Okay, good.

02:43.055 --> 02:44.156
How many folks you got in there?

02:44.157 --> 02:45.355
We got three people in here.

02:45.356 --> 02:46.324
Is that everybody, then?

02:46.325 --> 02:47.587
What do you mean,
is that everybody?

02:47.588 --> 02:48.787
You saying I'm a liar?

02:48.788 --> 02:50.394
No, no. Not at all.

02:50.395 --> 02:52.195
'Cause we're seriously
letting these people go.

02:52.196 --> 02:53.486
We're gonna send them out.

02:53.487 --> 02:54.749
All three of them.

02:54.750 --> 02:57.497
Go on. Go on. Go!

03:00.927 --> 03:02.550
I count one, two...

03:03.024 --> 03:04.488
Three hostages.

03:04.489 --> 03:05.393
Thank God.

03:06.376 --> 03:07.760
Okay. Terrific.

03:07.761 --> 03:08.575
Thank you, guys.

03:08.576 --> 03:11.276
Now, just give us a second here
to get these folks situated,

03:11.277 --> 03:13.635
and this will all be over
real soon. I promise.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.264
Suspects went out the
back door firing.

03:22.538 --> 03:23.624
Both of them down.

03:23.776 --> 03:24.633
Oh, damn it!

03:24.634 --> 03:26.216
What? I love happy endings.

03:26.217 --> 03:28.967
We need to see the bodies. Why?

03:28.968 --> 03:31.457
Well, this doesn't feel
like a happy ending to me.

03:35.801 --> 03:37.168
Brown coveralls.

03:38.039 --> 03:39.066
What do you know?

03:39.067 --> 03:40.460
I need to see his face.

03:41.202 --> 03:41.978
Come on.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.666
You're still missing
three suspects.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.907
How do you know that?

03:54.908 --> 03:57.840
Guy in the brown coveralls
belongs to a professional group

03:57.841 --> 04:00.439
of bank robbers we call the
"Dear Jane Gang."

04:00.440 --> 04:02.304
That's catchy,
but what does it mean?

04:02.305 --> 04:04.695
Well, Dear Jane gang
always pass a robbery note

04:04.696 --> 04:07.063
to a female teller that
starts with her name.

04:07.064 --> 04:09.335
"Dear Jane," for example,

04:09.336 --> 04:11.592
"we're holding your
husband and kids hostage.

04:11.593 --> 04:12.688
"If you want to see
them alive again,

04:12.689 --> 04:13.966
you'll empty all
the cash drawers."

04:13.967 --> 04:16.502
Now, they know the kids' names,
the husband's name...

04:16.503 --> 04:17.935
So they really do their homework.

04:24.694 --> 04:26.128
There was no note this morning.

04:26.926 --> 04:28.660
Well, I want to see
the security footage

04:28.694 --> 04:30.194
from the bank to be sure of that.

04:39.243 --> 04:40.571
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.499
Where are you guys going
with all this junk?

04:42.500 --> 04:44.357
It belonged to one of
our dead bank robbers...

04:44.358 --> 04:47.633
Not, uh, brown coveralls
but the other guy?

04:47.634 --> 04:48.627
Jason McDonald.

04:48.628 --> 04:49.387
Yeah.

04:49.388 --> 04:51.603
This is all the evidence we
collected on the warrant.

04:51.604 --> 04:53.180
Well, I guess the chief
needs to see this,

04:53.181 --> 04:54.236
but the front of the murder room

04:54.237 --> 04:56.231
is filled with witnesses
from the bank robbery.

04:56.896 --> 04:59.286
Well, then, where would you
like us to put it, lieutenant?

04:59.799 --> 05:01.768
Well, I haven't
heard any complaints

05:01.769 --> 05:03.989
out of the super-cubicle
for a while.

05:04.319 --> 05:05.687
Wait. We can't just dump...

05:05.688 --> 05:07.724
You gonna help me or what?

05:13.872 --> 05:15.030
Okay, according to witnesses,

05:15.031 --> 05:16.854
brown coveralls is saying,

05:16.855 --> 05:18.564
"everybody down, everybody down."

05:18.565 --> 05:19.908
And over here,

05:19.909 --> 05:22.382
brown coveralls tells
the security guard

05:22.383 --> 05:24.222
to put his weapon on the ground,

05:24.223 --> 05:25.576
which he does.

05:26.176 --> 05:28.881
Then the security guard's
gonna make a move.

05:28.882 --> 05:30.631
And there's the shooting.

05:32.264 --> 05:33.953
And here it is again.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.089
The guard's Andre Hicks,

05:38.090 --> 05:39.905
65-year-old ex-marine,

05:39.906 --> 05:42.154
basically there to open
the door for people.

05:42.155 --> 05:44.436
And gave his life for $8 an hour.

05:46.065 --> 05:48.255
Okay, so I see two robbers here,

05:48.256 --> 05:49.521
but you say there are more?

05:49.522 --> 05:51.623
Well, Dear Jane usually
has four inside

05:51.624 --> 05:53.133
and a getaway driver outside,

05:53.134 --> 05:54.480
for a total of five guys.

05:54.481 --> 05:57.225
Buzz, can you shift to
the parking-lot footage?

05:57.226 --> 05:58.208
Sure.

06:01.352 --> 06:02.055
Okay.

06:02.056 --> 06:04.790
Uh, well, two run out -
they're looking for their ride.

06:04.791 --> 06:07.350
Now, in their 20 or so jobs,

06:07.351 --> 06:09.216
they've always used
a van as a getaway.

06:09.217 --> 06:11.984
So, where is the van?

06:11.985 --> 06:14.599
You seem to know an awful lot
about these Dear Jane people.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.393
Why haven't we ever
heard of them before?

06:16.394 --> 06:17.683
Well, I've heard of them.

06:18.949 --> 06:20.988
What? The FBI sent out flyers.

06:21.364 --> 06:23.732
We also e-mailed you
footage of the Dear Jane

06:23.733 --> 06:26.547
robbing a bank in orange
county last month.

06:26.548 --> 06:28.601
Buzz, would you please look up
that e-mail for me? Yeah, chief.

06:28.602 --> 06:31.306
Yeah, 'cause I never saw it.
You've been very busy, sir.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.266
Now, you might try removing
"FBI" from your junk filter.

06:35.621 --> 06:36.779
Another question, Agent Howard...

06:36.780 --> 06:37.738
How did you recognize the

06:37.739 --> 06:39.209
guy this morning if
they always wore masks?

06:39.210 --> 06:41.627
Actually, up until this morning,
they never wore masks.

06:41.628 --> 06:43.824
They usually wear baseball caps.

06:43.825 --> 06:47.329
So, this morning,
two suspects... not five...

06:47.330 --> 06:49.447
wearing masks -
not baseball caps...

06:49.448 --> 06:52.072
bust into a bank with
automatic weapons,

06:52.073 --> 06:54.840
don't use a note, do kill someone.

06:54.841 --> 06:56.048
Despite all those discrepancies,

06:56.049 --> 06:57.127
you're convinced that the two guys

06:57.128 --> 06:58.272
that we ended up shooting today

06:58.273 --> 07:00.707
are part of this
"Dear Jane" outfit?

07:01.435 --> 07:02.949
Found the e-mail, chief. Oh.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.501
You want to play it, Buzz?

07:07.203 --> 07:08.307
Okay.

07:08.308 --> 07:10.028
There is brown coveralls.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.410
Now, here are two other guys.

07:12.411 --> 07:14.171
Now, this one, I think,

07:14.172 --> 07:16.100
is the second suspect
from this morning.

07:16.101 --> 07:17.964
And then... okay... freeze.
Can you freeze it?

07:17.965 --> 07:20.835
All right. Punch in. There. Yeah.

07:20.836 --> 07:22.220
That's brown coveralls.

07:22.221 --> 07:24.492
And I am telling you, regardless
of what happened this morning,

07:24.493 --> 07:26.666
these guys are
criminal masterminds.

07:26.667 --> 07:27.880
Masterminds?

07:27.881 --> 07:29.630
Meet Mr. Brown coveralls,

07:29.631 --> 07:31.357
A.K.A. Dennis Bailey,

07:31.358 --> 07:33.299
and his partner, Jason McDonald.

07:33.533 --> 07:37.693
What kind of masterminds bring
their I.D. to a bank robbery

07:37.694 --> 07:39.526
and then try to escape on foot?

07:40.303 --> 07:42.319
Well, at some point,
there was a van.

07:43.968 --> 07:45.871
Uh, excuse me, chief Johnson.
We're back.

07:45.872 --> 07:47.536
Finished with the warrant,
got some stuff.

07:47.866 --> 07:49.441
Afternoon, everybody.

07:49.746 --> 07:50.754
Well, thank you.

07:50.755 --> 07:51.610
Uh, lieutenant Tao,

07:51.611 --> 07:53.523
would you please go
back through the footage

07:53.524 --> 07:55.580
and see if you can find
any sign of a getaway van?

07:55.581 --> 07:56.714
I don't know how I'm

07:56.715 --> 07:58.291
supposed to look for
people I can't even see.

07:58.292 --> 08:00.340
Hey, chief? Robber one,
brown coveralls...

08:00.341 --> 08:01.356
that's Dennis Bailey,

08:01.357 --> 08:03.117
and the address on his
driver's license is old,

08:03.118 --> 08:04.894
so we currently have
no idea where he lived.

08:04.895 --> 08:07.029
But the guy that was
with him, Jason McDonald...

08:07.030 --> 08:08.799
his place was pretty
special, chief.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.439
Yeah. His whole place
was filled with these.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.104
Wait a minute.

08:12.105 --> 08:14.858
Why are you putting all
this junk in my cubicle?

08:14.859 --> 08:16.530
'Cause nobody ever
comes back here, sir.

08:16.531 --> 08:18.074
What was he doing
with all these safes?

08:18.075 --> 08:19.835
Dear Jane started
out boosting safes,

08:19.836 --> 08:21.036
from restaurants and bars.

08:21.037 --> 08:21.835
You know, their move up

08:21.836 --> 08:23.335
to banks has only been
in the last two years.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.462
Two years?!

08:24.463 --> 08:26.499
But if you've been working
on this case for that long,

08:26.500 --> 08:27.597
why haven't we heard...

08:28.630 --> 08:30.529
Uh, wait a minute.
Is this even your case?

08:32.572 --> 08:33.929
Well, n-not exactly.

08:33.965 --> 08:35.831
Well, then, why are you here?

08:35.865 --> 08:39.599
Um, I just found out my new
assignment this morning.

08:39.634 --> 08:41.734
And, uh, well, there is supposed

08:41.769 --> 08:44.070
to be an official
announcement made tomorrow,

08:44.104 --> 08:45.604
but, uh, this bank job...

08:45.638 --> 08:47.772
Well, anyway, um...

08:48.450 --> 08:52.009
I've been appointed the new
FBI liaison to the L.A.P.D.

08:55.546 --> 08:59.215
Well...Congratulations.

09:00.411 --> 09:02.784
I guess you'll be working
very closely with...

09:02.819 --> 09:04.586
Whoever is the next
chief of police.

09:05.668 --> 09:06.709
I don't... I don't understand.

09:06.710 --> 09:08.308
I... You never said anything

09:08.309 --> 09:09.820
about being up for the liaison...

09:09.821 --> 09:10.989
I didn't know, myself.

09:10.990 --> 09:14.188
I walked into work today,
and now here I am.

09:18.732 --> 09:21.411
Well, thank you for the warm welcome.
Oh, well, of course.

09:21.412 --> 09:24.251
We're all looking forward
to working with you.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.449
Oh. I mean...

09:26.450 --> 09:28.552
Congratulations, honey.
I'm... I'm...

09:28.553 --> 09:30.377
I'm so happy for you.

09:31.986 --> 09:34.114
And I-I think we should all
start working together,

09:34.115 --> 09:35.208
r-right now.

09:36.511 --> 09:37.593
These safes, for instance...

09:37.594 --> 09:39.113
Why don't we run all
the serial numbers

09:39.114 --> 09:42.160
against whatever data the
FBI has on the prior...

09:42.161 --> 09:43.450
Burglaries.

09:43.853 --> 09:44.778
Um...So...

09:44.779 --> 09:47.419
If you agree, uh, chief Pope?

09:48.562 --> 09:49.308
Love it.

09:49.309 --> 09:50.635
All right, then.

09:50.636 --> 09:53.465
Uh, would you please join me
back in the electronics room?

09:53.466 --> 09:54.690
Certainly. Thank you.

09:54.691 --> 09:55.777
Oh, and, gentlemen,

09:55.778 --> 09:57.407
if we are dealing with
a mastermind here,

09:57.408 --> 10:00.744
I seriously doubt it's the guy
who has safes in his house.

10:00.745 --> 10:03.696
So, let's keep looking for
the address on Dennis Bailey,

10:03.697 --> 10:05.785
our Mr. Brown coveralls.

10:05.786 --> 10:07.211
Thank y'all so much.

10:15.819 --> 10:18.370
So, the day before

10:18.371 --> 10:20.995
they're supposed to
announce the short list

10:20.996 --> 10:23.507
for candidates for
chief of police,

10:23.979 --> 10:27.788
the FBI sends over her husband
as the new liaison officer.

10:28.780 --> 10:31.802
Are you gonna give
him his own office?

10:38.601 --> 10:40.375
So, we lined up the security codes

10:40.376 --> 10:41.550
of the robbery footage

10:41.551 --> 10:43.329
with the parking lot
security cameras.

10:43.330 --> 10:45.336
So you can see the
shooting starts here.

10:45.743 --> 10:47.461
And seconds later,

10:48.030 --> 10:50.415
a Ford sedan whips out
of the parking lot.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.024
But there's no clear
view of the driver.

10:52.025 --> 10:54.208
Wait. There's something we
may have missed, though.

10:54.209 --> 10:55.705
As the Ford's backing out...

10:56.625 --> 10:59.136
...The reflection of
the bumper... there!

10:59.765 --> 11:01.828
The license plate.
Lieutenant Tao. Mm.

11:02.380 --> 11:03.713
Good catch, Buzz.

11:03.747 --> 11:04.647
Thanks.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.914
Oh. What "oh"?

11:06.915 --> 11:09.195
Comes up "Confidential - L.A.P.D."

11:09.460 --> 11:11.798
The registered owner
of this vehicle...

11:13.204 --> 11:14.346
is a cop.

11:14.347 --> 11:15.345
A cop?

11:15.346 --> 11:16.983
That guy was with us this morning.

11:16.984 --> 11:18.703
Hostage negotiator.

11:18.704 --> 11:20.696
He's in the murder room
interviewing witnesses

11:20.697 --> 11:22.696
with Provenza right now.

11:23.928 --> 11:25.647
"Detective Steve Hayward."

11:25.648 --> 11:27.790
Who better to set a
fire than a fireman?

11:32.094 --> 11:34.303
Now do you believe
there's a mastermind?

11:43.476 --> 11:45.643
So, you know something I don't?

11:46.016 --> 11:47.244
About?

11:48.071 --> 11:49.412
Maybe the FBI gets a heads-up

11:49.446 --> 11:51.447
who's on the short list for chief.

11:51.482 --> 11:52.915
Suddenly, they decide the husband

11:52.950 --> 11:54.283
of a certain high-ranking
female officer

11:54.317 --> 11:55.984
would make a good liaison.

11:56.019 --> 11:58.087
Look, if you're saying I'm here
because I'm close to Brenda,

11:58.122 --> 11:59.956
you could also say I'm here
because I'm close to you.

12:01.040 --> 12:01.658
Really?

12:02.573 --> 12:04.294
Where did I go to college?

12:04.580 --> 12:05.329
Back east.

12:05.363 --> 12:06.363
Stanford.

12:06.811 --> 12:07.698
What did I get my master's in?

12:09.034 --> 12:10.603
Mm-hmm. Never mind.

12:10.637 --> 12:11.838
How old are my kids?

12:13.074 --> 12:14.375
Yeah. Right. They chose you

12:14.409 --> 12:15.476
because you and I are so tight.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.044
Let me ask you this.

12:17.078 --> 12:19.104
Does Brenda even want to be chief?

12:19.105 --> 12:21.399
Because I've worked my
entire life for this job.

12:22.761 --> 12:24.050
Well, then, I wish you good luck.

12:29.756 --> 12:30.890
Steve.

12:30.924 --> 12:33.025
Would you like to join us
in the conference room?

12:33.060 --> 12:36.227
Chief Johnson wants to...
do a quick debriefing.

12:36.261 --> 12:37.327
Excuse me one sec.

12:39.195 --> 12:40.693
Right this way.

12:45.062 --> 12:46.996
You guys unhappy about something?

12:47.031 --> 12:48.731
Detective Hayward,
you've had so much success

12:48.765 --> 12:49.898
handling hostage situations,

12:49.932 --> 12:52.333
talking people out of
doing terrible things.

12:52.367 --> 12:53.734
I was curious...

12:53.769 --> 12:55.536
What do you think
went wrong today?

12:56.928 --> 12:59.107
Well, nothing went wrong, per se.

12:59.141 --> 13:01.509
The suspects were unpredictable,

13:01.543 --> 13:04.244
based on the ar-15 and ak
they were swinging around.

13:04.279 --> 13:07.047
Those are pretty nasty weapons
to bring to a bank robbery.

13:07.082 --> 13:08.748
It's almost like they
wanted us to shoot them.

13:09.287 --> 13:11.184
Suicide by cop.

13:11.539 --> 13:13.083
Looking at the transcripts,

13:13.084 --> 13:15.254
you never once asked the suspects

13:15.288 --> 13:16.722
to drop their weapons. Why?

13:17.115 --> 13:20.092
I was focused on the
release of the hostages,

13:20.126 --> 13:23.561
who were, despite my apparent
lack of success, set free.

13:23.596 --> 13:25.262
A vehicle registered in your name

13:25.297 --> 13:27.864
was seen leaving the
bank this morning

13:27.898 --> 13:29.432
during the robbery.

13:30.052 --> 13:31.367
Steve...

13:32.403 --> 13:33.869
That's your car.

13:38.124 --> 13:40.908
I-I-I came to work this
morning in my crown vic.

13:40.943 --> 13:42.676
This...

13:42.710 --> 13:44.277
I bought this car a
couple months ago...

13:45.054 --> 13:46.243
For my wife.

13:47.815 --> 13:49.716
Where's your wife at
this moment, Detective?

13:49.750 --> 13:51.117
What does she have to
do with any of this?

13:51.151 --> 13:53.586
Well, isn't it obvious?
Not to me, it isn't.

13:53.620 --> 13:56.588
Look, let's just get back
to where your wife might be.

13:57.923 --> 13:59.759
She said something about a...

13:59.793 --> 14:01.794
Meeting at a church.

14:01.828 --> 14:03.462
Then why was your
car at the bank...

14:03.496 --> 14:06.097
This morning?
How do you explain that?

14:06.946 --> 14:07.765
I can't.

14:07.799 --> 14:10.300
Okay, Detective,
this is what we need.

14:10.334 --> 14:13.202
Confirm exactly where you
were during the robbery

14:13.236 --> 14:15.471
and your wife's cellphone number.

14:15.505 --> 14:18.140
Just... just do that for us,
Steve, and...

14:18.174 --> 14:20.875
and we can straighten
this whole mess out.

14:24.145 --> 14:25.813
Oh. Lieutenant, would you please

14:25.847 --> 14:27.548
get the Detective's statement
right away, please?

14:34.778 --> 14:35.706
So, sorry, chief.

14:35.707 --> 14:37.985
I-I still don't know
where brown coveralls...

14:37.986 --> 14:39.623
I mean, Dennis Bailey... lived,

14:39.624 --> 14:42.645
but I found his brother,
Jed Bailey,

14:42.646 --> 14:44.663
and he's here in L.A.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.745
Mr. Bailey.

14:55.779 --> 14:58.113
Uh, are you Jed Bailey?

14:58.147 --> 15:00.879
I sure am. How can I help you?

15:00.880 --> 15:02.514
I'm deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson

15:02.549 --> 15:04.748
of the L.A.P.D., and this is
special Agent Fritz Howard

15:04.783 --> 15:06.016
of the FBI.

15:06.050 --> 15:07.283
May we have a moment
of your time, sir?

15:07.317 --> 15:09.016
Sure. What is it?

15:09.050 --> 15:10.318
When was the last time you saw

15:10.353 --> 15:11.786
or spoke to your brother -
Dennis?

15:12.632 --> 15:14.619
Uh, is... is he okay?

15:18.640 --> 15:20.289
Oh, my gosh.
What's happened to Dennis?

15:20.324 --> 15:21.290
Jed?

15:22.392 --> 15:23.358
I-I'm fine, honey.

15:23.393 --> 15:25.127
Um, take the kids inside.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.028
I'll be in in a minute.

15:27.648 --> 15:29.597
Was your brother alone the
last time you saw him?

15:30.966 --> 15:32.532
Uh...Yes. He was.

15:32.567 --> 15:35.668
He was...Almost always by himself.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.599
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.519
Mr. Bailey.

15:41.473 --> 15:42.975
We're sorry to tell you
your brother Dennis

15:42.976 --> 15:44.395
robbed a bank this morning

15:44.396 --> 15:46.506
and was later killed
in a police standoff.

15:48.713 --> 15:49.646
That...

15:49.680 --> 15:51.799
that can't be Dennis.
There's no way.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.689
I'm sorry, sir,
but we have him on film,

15:53.690 --> 15:55.775
and he had I.D.
on him when he was killed.

15:58.029 --> 15:59.366
Jed, everything okay?

16:02.595 --> 16:04.459
Uh, doing great. Thanks, Gene.

16:05.971 --> 16:07.563
My brother's not a violent person.

16:07.564 --> 16:09.156
He's never owned a
gun in his life.

16:09.157 --> 16:11.792
Well he had one today.

16:11.793 --> 16:14.120
And he used it to
kill a security guard.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.231
No. Oh, no, no, no.

16:19.639 --> 16:21.845
Well, he must... he must have
been mixed up with somebody.

16:21.846 --> 16:23.485
Well, he was, sir.

16:24.604 --> 16:26.953
This man was with him at the bank.

16:26.954 --> 16:28.907
Does he look at all
familiar to you?

16:28.908 --> 16:30.770
No. I don't know. It...

16:31.681 --> 16:32.858
Is he the guy with the guns?

16:32.859 --> 16:34.170
They both had guns, sir.

16:34.171 --> 16:36.266
Sir, can you tell us
where your brother lived?

16:46.561 --> 16:47.705
Oh, my gosh.

16:50.066 --> 16:51.543
What is it, Mr. Bradley?

16:52.400 --> 16:53.366
Those beers...

16:53.367 --> 16:55.148
He promised me he was gonna quit.

16:56.268 --> 16:58.715
I even drove him to a
couple of AA meetings.

17:00.141 --> 17:01.641
It's a difficult thing
to stop drinking.

17:02.969 --> 17:04.009
Could you tell me

17:04.010 --> 17:05.659
where those AA meetings were?

17:10.449 --> 17:13.185
Chief, it looks like the one
from the Orange County job.

17:15.490 --> 17:16.990
Guess he had a thing for these.

17:17.023 --> 17:18.191
What are you talking about?

17:18.224 --> 17:20.292
They're comfortable,
and they don't show dirt.

17:20.907 --> 17:23.396
40 grand in the
medicine cabinet. Okay.

17:24.999 --> 17:26.299
He hides his money at home

17:26.333 --> 17:28.934
and holds on to his
precious brown coveralls.

17:28.968 --> 17:30.533
Not a mastermind.

17:30.568 --> 17:31.868
So far, the only person we've met

17:31.902 --> 17:34.436
capable of planning
something like this

17:35.547 --> 17:37.106
is Detective Hayward.

17:37.659 --> 17:38.640
Hey, chief.

17:38.675 --> 17:41.210
You know that getaway car we
thought belonged to Hayward?

17:41.244 --> 17:43.145
Here's a rental receipt
for one exactly like it.

18:01.931 --> 18:03.255
Good afternoon, folks.

18:03.289 --> 18:05.156
My name is Boyd. I bet
you're looking for a minivan.

18:05.190 --> 18:08.793
Actually, we are trying
to locate this car.

18:08.827 --> 18:11.295
I'm sorry. Has your vehicle been
in an accident, lost, or stolen?

18:11.330 --> 18:12.596
No. We didn't rent the car.

18:12.631 --> 18:14.298
We just need to know
if it's been returned.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.668
Oh. Uh, okay. Let me just...

18:17.702 --> 18:18.936
See here.

18:21.507 --> 18:22.508
Lieutenant Tao.

18:23.164 --> 18:23.973
Okay, here it is.

18:23.974 --> 18:25.675
Uh, it was picked up this morning,

18:25.710 --> 18:27.010
at the driver's request.

18:27.044 --> 18:28.111
Who picked it up?

18:29.238 --> 18:30.646
Tim.

18:30.681 --> 18:32.348
He's out back.
I'll call him for you?

18:32.382 --> 18:33.482
No, no. Don't call him.

18:33.516 --> 18:34.590
I'll go get him.

18:35.851 --> 18:37.484
Uh, chief.

18:37.518 --> 18:39.450
Sanchez says he has Hayward's
wife in the murder room.

18:39.485 --> 18:40.818
Uh-huh.

18:41.269 --> 18:43.185
She says she was at choir
practice this morning

18:43.220 --> 18:44.518
during the robbery.

18:44.997 --> 18:45.918
And she has the car,

18:46.461 --> 18:47.918
but it's missing the front plate.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.019
Missing the front plate?

18:49.053 --> 18:50.620
They stole the cop's
license plate,

18:50.654 --> 18:51.687
put it on their rental car

18:51.722 --> 18:53.522
so that they wouldn't
get pulled over.

18:53.557 --> 18:54.790
Yeah, but how did they know

18:54.824 --> 18:56.626
that Mrs. Hayward's
husband is a cop?

18:56.660 --> 18:58.194
I told you. They were smart.

18:58.580 --> 19:00.697
Hey! There's no Tim working here.

19:00.732 --> 19:01.899
Boyd returned the car.

19:01.933 --> 19:02.967
Boyd? Who's Boyd?

19:03.002 --> 19:04.202
"The guy helping us" Boyd!

19:04.236 --> 19:05.504
Oh, you mean Boyd?

19:05.539 --> 19:06.706
Where'd that little jerk go?

19:08.710 --> 19:10.244
I think that's him.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.100
There goes another one of
your genius bank robbers,

19:14.101 --> 19:16.286
driving off in his
little clown car.

19:17.710 --> 19:19.556
Well, he has the
getaway part down.

19:31.439 --> 19:32.939
Oh, thank God.

19:32.974 --> 19:34.541
Food.

19:34.575 --> 19:36.042
I'm starving.

19:36.076 --> 19:37.176
Hey.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.076
I got great news.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.778
The FBI caught the Dear Jane
getaway driver, Boyd Martin.

19:41.445 --> 19:42.853
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

19:42.854 --> 19:44.307
You stole my suspect.

19:44.940 --> 19:46.916
Working together doesn't
mean that we find him,

19:46.951 --> 19:48.051
and then you swoop in.

19:48.085 --> 19:49.741
We didn't swoop.

19:49.742 --> 19:52.087
We tracked his
financial transactions

19:52.122 --> 19:52.967
and then deduced.

19:52.968 --> 19:55.296
Oh, for Pete's sake,
don't gussy it up.

19:55.658 --> 19:57.377
Boyd Martin paid for
an airline ticket

19:57.378 --> 19:58.666
using his own credit card.

19:58.667 --> 20:01.398
A deaf, dumb, and blind orangutan
could have tracked him down.

20:01.399 --> 20:03.328
Well, then,
why didn't you? We did.

20:03.329 --> 20:05.153
And don't pretend
you don't know this.

20:05.154 --> 20:06.704
The L.A.P.D. was there.

20:07.184 --> 20:08.598
Undercovers watched Boyd

20:08.599 --> 20:11.117
go into that airport parking
garage and never come out.

20:12.333 --> 20:13.510
Doesn't take a mastermind

20:13.511 --> 20:15.134
to figure out the
feds grabbed him.

20:15.135 --> 20:16.870
You can't blame us because
we like our suspects alive.

20:16.871 --> 20:19.344
Yeah, well, what if Boyd was
meeting his conspirators

20:19.345 --> 20:21.735
inside the terminal? Hmm?

20:21.736 --> 20:22.952
Then we could have caught

20:22.953 --> 20:24.456
the whole Dear Jane gang,
together.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.257
Anybody at the FBI
ever think of that?

20:26.258 --> 20:27.523
Will you relax?

20:28.225 --> 20:30.223
Besides admitting he's
the getaway driver,

20:30.224 --> 20:32.452
Boyd is not talking to the FBI.

20:32.453 --> 20:34.746
Well, he should be
not talking to me!

20:34.747 --> 20:37.619
This is exactly the same thing
you always accuse me of.

20:37.620 --> 20:39.549
You hate it when I take help
and information from you

20:39.550 --> 20:42.083
and then arrest the very
person we're both looking for.

20:42.084 --> 20:43.268
At least I don't lie to you.

20:43.269 --> 20:45.453
I have been completely honest with you.
I have never lied to you!

20:45.454 --> 20:46.949
Oh! That's the biggest
lie of all. Not once.

20:46.950 --> 20:49.085
Not once. Never. You know what?
I don't take it personally.

20:49.086 --> 20:50.748
Maybe I have omitted
certain details about...

20:50.749 --> 20:52.491
if you want to lie in order
to get Boyd transferred

20:52.492 --> 20:53.536
into L.A.P.D.
custody, you go right ahead.

20:53.537 --> 20:54.480
I will do whatever necessary

20:54.481 --> 20:55.425
to get that kid in
my interview room

20:55.426 --> 20:57.416
because he is guilty
of a triple homicide.

20:57.417 --> 20:58.210
Triple homicide?

20:58.211 --> 20:59.754
You're including
Bailey and McDonald?

20:59.755 --> 21:00.633
They're bank robbers.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.634
You don't get to decide
who my victims are.

21:02.985 --> 21:05.754
Three people were killed
in that bank robbery.

21:05.755 --> 21:07.443
A-and California law -
they don't care

21:07.444 --> 21:09.817
I-I-if Boyd drove the car
or pulled the trigger.

21:09.818 --> 21:11.779
Boyd is not the mastermind
of these robberies.

21:11.780 --> 21:14.475
Once and for all, we are not
looking for a bank robber.

21:14.476 --> 21:16.261
We are looking for a murderer!

21:17.156 --> 21:19.164
And if the FBI thinks that
they're gonna make a deal

21:19.198 --> 21:21.200
with Boyd on a bunch of
no-account robberies,

21:21.234 --> 21:22.703
well, they are jumping the gun.

21:22.737 --> 21:24.504
Because I am arresting that kid

21:24.539 --> 21:26.490
even if I have to get a
court order to do it.

21:26.491 --> 21:27.906
Now who's not working together?

21:27.907 --> 21:29.763
And they jumped the
gun on that, too.

21:30.227 --> 21:31.450
Appointing you liaison...

21:31.451 --> 21:33.792
Before the short list for
chief even comes out.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.529
I mean, what if I'm not on it?

21:42.738 --> 21:44.319
So you think the only
reason the FBI promoted me

21:44.353 --> 21:45.453
is because of you.

21:45.487 --> 21:47.354
Well, that's not the only reason.

21:47.388 --> 21:49.188
Um, of course you're qualified.

21:52.590 --> 21:55.456
You know, this should have
been a really big day for me.

21:57.258 --> 21:58.858
Oh, honey, I-I'm proud of you.

21:58.892 --> 22:00.092
I am.

22:00.126 --> 22:01.926
Whenever you don't
get what you want,

22:01.960 --> 22:04.261
you go straight for the
jugular, every time.

22:04.295 --> 22:05.661
What is that?

22:07.826 --> 22:09.130
I'm sorry, Fritzi.

22:09.164 --> 22:10.302
I'm mostly doing so much better

22:10.303 --> 22:12.309
with these things, aren't I?

22:12.310 --> 22:14.597
I'm not a suspect!

22:18.138 --> 22:19.914
I completely apologize!

22:24.877 --> 22:26.777
You did steal my suspect.

22:29.114 --> 22:31.715
We're checking out all
the Haywards' friends.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.885
They're both on a bowling team.

22:33.919 --> 22:35.987
No link to the robbers there.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.421
Wife's in the church choir.

22:37.456 --> 22:38.856
They ask to go home?

22:38.890 --> 22:40.925
No. We kept them
comfortable overnight.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.160
They're watching tv now.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.395
Hey, chief.

22:43.429 --> 22:44.863
I'm, uh, looking at
Hayward's finances.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.664
He's got no boats,
no second homes,

22:46.699 --> 22:48.399
no Vegas blowouts or
anything like that.

22:48.434 --> 22:49.767
Meanwhile, everyone else

22:49.802 --> 22:51.603
from Dear Jane had
big money problems.

22:51.637 --> 22:54.272
Dennis Bailey,
A.K.A. Brown coveralls,

22:54.307 --> 22:55.707
was drowning in credit-card debt.

22:55.741 --> 22:59.010
And, uh, his partner from yesterday,
Jason McDonald,

22:59.045 --> 23:02.247
he literally put the
"dead" in "deadbeat dad."

23:02.281 --> 23:05.083
And our rental-car specialist,
Boyd Martin,

23:05.118 --> 23:07.186
has 80 grand in college loans.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.087
Chief, I found
something on the safes.

23:09.121 --> 23:09.997
A few of the serial numbers

23:09.998 --> 23:11.995
tracked back to
burglaries in Oregon,

23:11.996 --> 23:13.812
where Jason McDonald
went to college.

23:13.813 --> 23:15.739
Was Dennis Bailey
ever a student there?

23:15.740 --> 23:17.628
Dennis Bailey never
went to college.

23:17.629 --> 23:18.932
Mm. Big surprise.

23:19.219 --> 23:20.449
What about the Haywards?

23:20.450 --> 23:22.639
Born and raised here. Met at UCLA.

23:22.640 --> 23:26.088
And Steve's... Um, Hayward's
alibi during the bank robbery

23:26.089 --> 23:26.967
checks out.

23:27.302 --> 23:29.166
So why are you still holding him?

23:32.182 --> 23:34.781
Detective Hayward's union rep
was here for like half an hour,

23:34.782 --> 23:36.621
complaining about how
he's being treated.

23:37.652 --> 23:39.316
Tell him the detective's
making overtime

23:39.317 --> 23:41.060
and that he's helping
us solve the case.

23:41.061 --> 23:42.531
"Helping" by watching cable

23:42.532 --> 23:43.812
in your conference
room with Provenza?

23:43.813 --> 23:45.372
Until I figure out
how his license plate

23:45.373 --> 23:46.773
wound up on the rental car,

23:46.774 --> 23:47.916
I certainly ca... I know.

23:47.917 --> 23:49.172
Maybe Detective Hayward

23:49.173 --> 23:50.397
is the Dear Jane mastermind

23:50.398 --> 23:51.965
and he gave the
plates to his partners

23:51.966 --> 23:53.702
because nobody pulls
over a cop's car.

23:53.703 --> 23:54.625
And if they did,

23:54.626 --> 23:56.969
he could just say,
"someone stole my plates."

23:56.970 --> 23:58.865
It's incredible.
Thank you.

23:58.866 --> 24:00.010
I mean, "incredible"...

24:00.011 --> 24:01.363
Incredible... not credible

24:01.364 --> 24:02.900
as in "wrong" as in it's wrong

24:02.901 --> 24:04.268
to trash Hayward's reputation

24:04.269 --> 24:05.388
and piss off the union

24:05.389 --> 24:07.254
just so you can look all
tough for the Mayor!

24:09.869 --> 24:11.671
I'm tired of being
treated this way.

24:12.092 --> 24:14.451
You are exhausting
everyone who works here!

24:14.452 --> 24:17.244
I can't wait for this whole
"chief" thing to be over!

24:17.245 --> 24:20.026
Says the person whose husband
was just appointed FBI liaison

24:20.027 --> 24:21.003
to the L.A.P.D.

24:21.004 --> 24:23.034
I suppose you think I had
something to do with that?

24:23.035 --> 24:25.129
Well, you couldn't be
more wrong... again!

24:26.185 --> 24:27.106
Come in!

24:28.626 --> 24:29.705
Excuse me, chief...

24:29.706 --> 24:30.873
um, "chiefs."

24:30.874 --> 24:32.763
We found a link between
the Dear Jane gang

24:32.764 --> 24:34.067
and Detective Hayward.

24:38.211 --> 24:39.708
Good thing he's still here, then.

24:41.380 --> 24:42.190
May I?

24:42.882 --> 24:44.719
Yes. Sorry to have kept you.

25:00.292 --> 25:00.969
So, tell me.

25:00.970 --> 25:03.293
What type of parking lot
could you reliably expect

25:03.294 --> 25:05.307
to be unattended for an
hour or so at a time?

25:05.308 --> 25:06.573
I don't know. A theater?

25:06.574 --> 25:09.109
Try the parking lot at
Detective Hayward's church.

25:09.369 --> 25:11.236
How does that connect
to the robbers?

25:11.271 --> 25:12.604
Well, it doesn't, exactly,

25:12.639 --> 25:14.706
but remember Dennis
Bailey's brother, Jed?

25:14.741 --> 25:16.875
Well, it turns out Jed
and Detective Hayward

25:16.910 --> 25:18.277
attend the same church.

25:18.311 --> 25:19.192
Uh, chief?

25:19.193 --> 25:21.289
Someone tagged a photo of
Jed Bailey on Facebook,

25:21.290 --> 25:22.763
some kind of college reunion.

25:22.764 --> 25:25.179
Now, Dennis Bailey may
not have gone to school

25:25.213 --> 25:26.479
with Jason McDonald,

25:26.513 --> 25:28.813
but Jed Bailey did -
They were part of the same frat.

25:30.316 --> 25:32.983
That Jed Bailey is such
a good little liar.

25:33.017 --> 25:36.988
And stealing a cop's
license plate from church?!

25:37.601 --> 25:38.390
Finally!

25:38.424 --> 25:41.393
Signs of intelligent life from
inside the Dear Jane gang!

25:41.428 --> 25:43.329
So Jason and Dennis
connect to Jed.

25:43.364 --> 25:44.564
What about Boyd?

25:44.599 --> 25:47.034
You think the FBI's gonna
let us talk to him?

25:47.069 --> 25:47.796
No.

25:49.272 --> 25:51.240
But maybe they'll
help us if I tell them

25:51.274 --> 25:52.910
we're gonna search Boyd's house.

25:52.944 --> 25:55.413
Wait. W-we need the FBI's
cooperation for that.

25:55.447 --> 25:58.250
Well...I'm about to get it.

25:58.526 --> 26:00.219
Pardon me.

26:03.223 --> 26:04.756
Special Agent Howard.

26:04.791 --> 26:06.058
Oh, hello, Fritz.

26:06.092 --> 26:09.259
I am officially requesting
that the FBI liaison officer

26:09.294 --> 26:11.860
provide the L.A.P.D. with all
of the information y'all have

26:11.894 --> 26:13.661
on one Boyd Martin.

26:15.141 --> 26:16.996
You know I can't do that.

26:17.333 --> 26:18.030
All right, then.

26:18.065 --> 26:19.932
We'll have to go search his house.

26:19.966 --> 26:21.466
We have all the evidence.

26:21.501 --> 26:24.002
You have no standing
to search his house.

26:24.036 --> 26:25.570
Actually, I do. I have a witness.

26:25.604 --> 26:26.437
Who?

26:26.472 --> 26:27.338
You.

26:27.372 --> 26:27.943
Me?

26:27.944 --> 26:29.785
Did you or did you not
tell me last night

26:29.786 --> 26:31.930
that Boyd admitted to
being the getaway driver?

26:33.400 --> 26:36.351
I did, but that was during
a personal conversation

26:36.352 --> 26:37.752
with my wife.

26:37.753 --> 26:38.543
Uh-huh.

26:38.544 --> 26:40.768
So, do you want to be
listed on my search warrant

26:40.769 --> 26:42.550
as a witness or an informant?

26:42.799 --> 26:44.926
Brenda, we are getting
our own warrant

26:44.927 --> 26:46.088
for Boyd's house.

26:46.089 --> 26:48.158
Oh! Look...

26:48.582 --> 26:50.085
Either I put your
name on that warrant,

26:50.086 --> 26:51.615
or you tell me what
I want to know.

26:51.616 --> 26:53.629
You know, I-I-I really think

26:53.630 --> 26:56.613
you are beginning to
lose your perspective.

26:56.614 --> 26:57.942
My perspective?!

26:58.238 --> 27:01.076
The FBI is fiddling around

27:01.077 --> 27:03.428
with a bunch of bank robberies

27:03.462 --> 27:05.695
while I've got a triple
homicide to solve!

27:05.730 --> 27:07.595
What about that poor
security guard, huh?

27:07.596 --> 27:09.563
Are you telling me that
no one is going to jail

27:09.598 --> 27:10.832
for his murder?

27:10.866 --> 27:12.067
You are my husband!

27:12.101 --> 27:13.802
You're supposed to be helping me!

27:13.837 --> 27:14.803
That is just the beginning

27:14.838 --> 27:15.972
of my perspective!

27:16.006 --> 27:17.741
You want more?
'Cause I can give it to you.

27:17.775 --> 27:18.709
Hold on for one second.

27:27.589 --> 27:29.889
Chief, Flynn says that...

27:32.759 --> 27:35.426
Well, maybe now is
not a good time.

27:36.550 --> 27:39.495
I'm on hold with our new
FBI liaison officer.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.531
And I'm all out of
candy bars. Oh. Oh.

27:45.179 --> 27:45.920
Well,

27:47.269 --> 27:49.170
you know what they say.

27:51.865 --> 27:52.990
It's, uh...

27:55.896 --> 27:58.375
never easy working with family.

28:03.387 --> 28:06.760
Anyway, Flynn says the
license plate was stolen.

28:06.761 --> 28:09.518
So can we let the
Haywards go home?

28:09.552 --> 28:10.719
Please?

28:13.824 --> 28:15.844
All right, I will
answer your questions

28:15.845 --> 28:18.565
if you promise not to
serve this search warrant.

28:19.180 --> 28:21.221
Is Boyd Martin related
to Dennis Bailey,

28:21.222 --> 28:22.719
Mr. Brown coveralls?

28:23.735 --> 28:26.191
Yeah. They were second cousins.

28:27.443 --> 28:28.710
Any other questions?

28:28.744 --> 28:29.810
No.

28:29.845 --> 28:31.112
Uh...

28:31.146 --> 28:32.212
Well, yes.

28:33.208 --> 28:34.714
Do you know who the
mastermind is yet?

28:34.749 --> 28:35.749
No.

28:35.783 --> 28:37.550
Good, 'cause I do.

28:40.103 --> 28:42.391
If Boyd Martin is Dennis
Bailey's second cousin,

28:42.392 --> 28:44.727
that means he's also Jed
Bailey's second cousin.

28:44.761 --> 28:46.462
That means they're all connected.

28:46.496 --> 28:48.330
Well, does that mean
that we can say goodbye

28:48.331 --> 28:50.464
to Ozzie and Harriet
in our conference room?

28:50.498 --> 28:52.899
I cannot sit through
one more episode

28:52.933 --> 28:55.067
of "House Hunters International."

28:55.102 --> 28:56.335
No.

28:56.369 --> 28:59.304
We're still missing the
fifth Dear Jane gang member.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.672
But, here.

29:00.707 --> 29:02.007
Give them some candy.

29:42.782 --> 29:45.516
Gentlemen, whenever people
run away from us like that,

29:45.550 --> 29:47.884
I feel the least we can
do is chase after them.

29:47.919 --> 29:48.885
I agree.

30:00.106 --> 30:02.110
Good afternoon...

30:02.144 --> 30:03.411
I forgot your name.

30:03.446 --> 30:05.346
Deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.

30:05.381 --> 30:07.115
Gosh, I'm sorry, chief Johnson.

30:07.149 --> 30:08.349
But I'm actually running
late for a meeting

30:08.383 --> 30:10.818
at the funeral home about my
brother's memorial service.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.619
Is there something I can
help you with real quick?

30:12.654 --> 30:15.121
Golly gee, there is, real quick,
if you could turn around,

30:15.156 --> 30:16.556
put your hands behind your back

30:16.590 --> 30:17.924
so I can arrest you
for the murders

30:17.959 --> 30:19.793
of Andre Hicks, Jason McDonald,
and Dennis Bailey.

30:19.827 --> 30:21.828
What? Murders?

30:21.863 --> 30:23.129
Jed Bailey,

30:23.164 --> 30:24.698
you have the right
to remain silent.

30:24.732 --> 30:25.966
If you give up that right... Ow!

30:26.000 --> 30:27.200
...Anything you say can

30:27.235 --> 30:29.135
and will be used against
you in a court of law.

30:29.170 --> 30:30.469
Bad dog!

30:30.504 --> 30:32.738
No ball! Go home!

30:32.772 --> 30:34.139
Go home, Ralphie!

30:34.173 --> 30:35.373
Go home!

30:47.144 --> 30:48.672
Y'all have been so patient.

30:48.673 --> 30:50.641
I'm so sorry to have
bothered you with all this.

30:50.675 --> 30:52.776
Hey. Sometimes crummy
things turn out okay.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.676
But that's what
overtime is for, right?

30:54.711 --> 30:56.044
Uh, speaking of which,

30:56.079 --> 30:57.979
would you, uh, would you
sign that time sheet for me?

30:58.013 --> 31:00.515
Oh. Uh, of course. My pleasure.

31:00.550 --> 31:02.351
You know, we're putting
all this extra cash

31:02.385 --> 31:04.219
toward that condo we
saw down in Panama,

31:04.254 --> 31:06.023
and you are gonna
come to visit, mister.

31:06.826 --> 31:08.499
Can't wait for you to get there.

31:09.657 --> 31:10.432
There you go.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.658
Thank you so much.

31:17.379 --> 31:19.000
So, where are we with Jed Bailey?

31:19.035 --> 31:20.869
Well, his, uh, income tax return

31:20.903 --> 31:24.070
said he made about
$38,000 last year.

31:24.104 --> 31:25.471
His new S.U.V.
is worth maybe twice that.

31:25.505 --> 31:26.705
And on top of that,

31:26.739 --> 31:28.172
he's got his kids
in a private school

31:28.207 --> 31:30.641
and a golf-club membership
in the five figures.

31:30.676 --> 31:33.877
Someone from the Dear Jane gang
is making money robbing banks.

31:34.368 --> 31:36.064
Chief, we got the statement

31:36.065 --> 31:38.193
from Gene-Gene,
the jogging machine. Oh.

31:38.586 --> 31:39.683
Guy wouldn't shut up.

31:39.717 --> 31:43.921
Yeah, Gene is $350,000
upside down on his mortgage.

31:43.955 --> 31:46.690
Ohh. This statement
is full of good stuff.

31:46.724 --> 31:49.426
But Gene also said he wasn't
at the robbery yesterday,

31:49.460 --> 31:51.327
and neither was Jed. Uh-huh. So?

31:52.208 --> 31:54.853
So, you can't make Jed Bailey
for the murders at the bank

31:55.142 --> 31:56.046
if he wasn't there.

31:56.047 --> 31:58.868
Oh, he was there, lieutenant.
I promise you.

31:58.903 --> 32:01.671
Jed Bailey was at that bank.

32:05.579 --> 32:06.679
If there's anything more

32:06.713 --> 32:08.381
that I can do to help the police,

32:08.415 --> 32:09.743
of course, I want to do it.

32:10.207 --> 32:11.638
Like I said, I-I had no idea

32:11.639 --> 32:13.214
who Dennis was
running around with.

32:13.215 --> 32:15.948
I don't know what I can
tell you beyond that.

32:15.982 --> 32:17.549
Not even about your neighbor Gene?

32:17.584 --> 32:19.618
Is... is he mixed up in all this?

32:21.301 --> 32:22.622
Well, Gene says,

32:22.656 --> 32:24.157
in the last four years,

32:24.191 --> 32:26.558
he's participated in
over 30 burglaries

32:26.593 --> 32:29.995
and 10 bank robberies
planned by you, sir.

32:30.029 --> 32:31.663
Wait! What?

32:31.697 --> 32:33.898
Look, we already found the
safes you stole, Mr. Bailey.

32:33.932 --> 32:36.133
We collected them from your
fraternity brother's house.

32:36.167 --> 32:38.001
Not to mention all
the video footage

32:38.036 --> 32:39.969
we have of you in a baseball cap,

32:40.004 --> 32:43.205
handing threatening
notes to tellers.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.740
But I-I-I don't
care about all that.

32:44.774 --> 32:46.307
I care about the murders.

32:46.757 --> 32:48.741
Murders? Now, hang on.

32:48.776 --> 32:49.809
Three people were killed

32:49.843 --> 32:51.343
at that bank yesterday, Mr. Bailey,

32:51.378 --> 32:53.078
including a veteran,
and you were there.

32:53.112 --> 32:55.747
I'm sorry, but you
people have it all wrong.

32:55.782 --> 32:56.915
You can ask my wife

32:56.950 --> 32:58.250
where I was all day yesterday.

32:58.284 --> 33:00.219
Now, wait.
Wasn't it your wife's job

33:00.253 --> 33:02.321
to babysit while you
were out robbing?

33:02.355 --> 33:03.989
Because Gene says
she did that a lot,

33:04.023 --> 33:05.757
which makes her as guilty as you.

33:05.791 --> 33:07.625
Now, hold on. My wife...

33:08.294 --> 33:09.126
Gene...

33:12.174 --> 33:13.396
And... and you believed him?

33:14.698 --> 33:16.032
Just saying whatever?

33:16.066 --> 33:17.600
Lying about my kids even?

33:17.635 --> 33:20.436
Let's talk about your kids
for a minute, Mr. Bailey.

33:20.470 --> 33:22.704
I-I don't mean the
private schools,

33:22.738 --> 33:24.039
the fancy away camps,

33:24.073 --> 33:25.574
and the beautiful house...

33:25.609 --> 33:27.843
All the luxuries you've
managed to give them

33:27.878 --> 33:30.412
on a $38,000 income.

33:30.446 --> 33:32.447
But how will they survive

33:32.481 --> 33:35.417
without their dad and their mom?

33:38.039 --> 33:40.307
You claim you weren't
at that bank yesterday,

33:40.341 --> 33:41.841
Mr. Bailey.

33:41.876 --> 33:43.243
Make me believe you.

33:51.784 --> 33:54.418
My wife had nothing to do
with any of this, okay?

33:54.453 --> 33:55.853
I'm listening.

33:55.887 --> 33:58.688
And I never killed anybody.

33:58.722 --> 33:59.989
Ever.

34:00.024 --> 34:01.023
What I was doing

34:01.058 --> 34:02.091
I was doing to help

34:02.125 --> 34:03.658
my friends and my family.

34:03.693 --> 34:06.494
You mean Dennis, Jason, Boyd...

34:06.528 --> 34:07.495
And Gene.

34:07.529 --> 34:09.429
I cannot believe Gene

34:09.464 --> 34:11.532
turning on me like this.

34:11.565 --> 34:12.960
People, man.

34:13.734 --> 34:15.168
They see a chance to
jump ahead of you,

34:15.202 --> 34:16.302
brother, they grab it.

34:18.237 --> 34:20.205
I'm... I'm just -
I'm so disappointed

34:20.239 --> 34:21.371
in the world right now.

34:24.241 --> 34:25.608
How is it, Mr. Bailey,

34:25.641 --> 34:27.976
that after all the
robberies you did,

34:28.010 --> 34:30.143
rescuing your friends and family,

34:30.626 --> 34:32.612
they still have their
same old money problems?

34:32.647 --> 34:33.847
Yeah.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.382
I can only do so much.

34:35.416 --> 34:37.583
Gene, for instance, my neighbor,

34:37.617 --> 34:39.752
I gave him an extra
10% on the last job

34:39.786 --> 34:41.387
so he could keep his house.

34:41.420 --> 34:42.989
No, no. He says you only did that

34:43.023 --> 34:45.158
because you didn't want
a foreclosure next door.

34:45.193 --> 34:47.237
Oh, well, that's a lie,
and he knows it.

34:47.237 --> 34:49.397
The other guys were plenty
upset when I helped him.

34:49.431 --> 34:51.733
Isn't that because you
took Gene's extra money

34:51.766 --> 34:54.370
from their cut,
not from your 60% cut?

34:54.404 --> 34:56.505
I had the most to lose!

34:56.539 --> 34:58.507
A wife, kids,

34:58.541 --> 35:00.875
everything we work
our whole lives for!

35:02.444 --> 35:03.744
I did all the planning.

35:03.778 --> 35:05.753
I researched bank
employee schedules,

35:05.754 --> 35:06.554
floor plans...

35:06.555 --> 35:08.931
I made sure that there were
no schools or parks nearby.

35:08.932 --> 35:10.212
No potential harm to kids.

35:10.213 --> 35:12.018
I made it safe for people!

35:12.019 --> 35:12.905
Really?

35:12.906 --> 35:15.615
Tell me how sending your
friend and your brother

35:15.616 --> 35:18.270
into that bank with guns
a-blazin' made things safer.

35:18.271 --> 35:20.383
I didn't send anybody
into that bank!

35:20.384 --> 35:22.630
Oh, I guess you were too busy. No!

35:22.665 --> 35:23.276
So you sent a friend and

35:23.277 --> 35:24.499
your brother into that bank...
I didn't do that.

35:24.534 --> 35:25.205
I would never do such a thing.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.100
...So that they could
take all the risk.

35:26.134 --> 35:27.869
You put them... sir... I swear.

35:27.903 --> 35:28.712
I have proof that you deliberately

35:28.713 --> 35:29.737
put your brother...
I planned that robbery.

35:29.771 --> 35:31.439
Would you just listen to me for
one second?...Into harm's way...

35:31.473 --> 35:34.274
I passed on that bank!

35:34.309 --> 35:35.166
I passed on it!

35:35.167 --> 35:37.454
I said, "do not rob that bank"!

35:37.974 --> 35:39.679
You passed on that bank?

35:39.713 --> 35:42.214
Yes! That is what I
am trying to tell you!

35:46.054 --> 35:47.087
Why?

35:51.924 --> 35:53.624
Because when I inspected it,

35:53.659 --> 35:56.059
I found too many
entrances and exits.

35:56.957 --> 35:59.462
I told the guys it was going on the
"maybe later" pile.

35:59.496 --> 36:01.530
She's right. He was there.

36:01.564 --> 36:03.164
Did you steal a policeman's
license plate...

36:03.199 --> 36:04.799
We got the confession.

36:04.833 --> 36:07.268
...From his wife's car at church?

36:07.302 --> 36:09.402
For another job.

36:09.437 --> 36:11.238
Next week.

36:11.272 --> 36:13.273
Which I'm pretty sure is canceled.

36:15.075 --> 36:16.875
You scouted that bank.

36:16.910 --> 36:18.543
And you rejected it.

36:18.577 --> 36:19.711
Yes. Yes.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.380
That is exactly what I
am trying to tell you.

36:24.204 --> 36:26.983
And, even if I had said,
"let's go ahead,"

36:27.017 --> 36:29.619
guns would not have been
any part of my plan...

36:29.653 --> 36:31.554
for that bank or any bank.

36:32.660 --> 36:34.727
All right, Mr. Bailey.
I believe you.

36:34.728 --> 36:36.658
I believe that you were
not at that bank yesterday

36:36.692 --> 36:37.960
during the robbery.

36:37.961 --> 36:40.471
Your gang got greedy and
pulled off a job without you.

36:40.472 --> 36:42.184
Exactly. But...

36:42.649 --> 36:44.832
You still have the license plate
that was used in the robbery.

36:44.833 --> 36:48.014
And worse, you cased
the bank as a target.

36:48.015 --> 36:49.909
That makes you an accessory,

36:49.910 --> 36:52.167
which means you are as responsible

36:52.168 --> 36:53.960
for the murder of
that security guard

36:53.961 --> 36:55.503
as your friend and your brother,

36:55.504 --> 36:57.649
neither of whom would have been
there if it weren't for you.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.018
And how do I know that?

36:59.722 --> 37:01.496
Because they're not smart enough.

37:04.613 --> 37:06.225
Hold on. Hold on!

37:06.226 --> 37:07.479
Wait a minute!

37:08.591 --> 37:09.590
Yes, Mr. Bailey?

37:09.591 --> 37:12.031
I'm not the kind of criminal
you're making me out to be!

37:12.032 --> 37:15.576
Oh, I know precisely who you are,
Mr. Bailey.

37:15.577 --> 37:17.721
You're the man that
murdered his brother.

37:36.770 --> 37:38.208
That was fast.

37:38.209 --> 37:40.671
Y'all must be anxious to
close your bank robberies.

37:40.672 --> 37:42.394
Just like you are to
finish your murder.

37:42.946 --> 37:45.848
Boyd thinks he's here to talk
about driving the getaway car.

37:45.882 --> 37:47.529
You get Gene a deal
on all state charges?

37:47.530 --> 37:49.320
He wasn't at the
robbery yesterday,

37:49.321 --> 37:51.039
and he didn't plan it,
so he's all yours.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.632
Did you happen to mention
the federal government

37:52.633 --> 37:54.355
would have their own
charges to press?

37:54.389 --> 37:56.557
Oh, may have slipped my mind.

37:58.578 --> 37:59.768
Hello, Boyd.

37:59.769 --> 38:01.481
You drove off so
quickly yesterday,

38:01.482 --> 38:03.347
I didn't get a chance
to introduce myself.

38:03.348 --> 38:05.339
I'm deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson.

38:05.802 --> 38:06.641
How do you do?

38:06.642 --> 38:07.883
Well, I'm just fine and dandy.

38:07.884 --> 38:09.236
But you're under arrest.

38:10.044 --> 38:11.100
I can't be under arrest.

38:11.101 --> 38:12.676
I-I made a deal with the FBI.

38:12.677 --> 38:14.292
Tell her about the deal we made.

38:14.293 --> 38:15.932
Your deal is for bank robbery.

38:15.933 --> 38:17.372
You're not going to jail for that.

38:17.373 --> 38:18.774
You're going to jail for murder.

38:18.808 --> 38:19.809
But he... he said...

38:19.810 --> 38:22.111
This isn't an argument, Boyd.
This is an arrest.

38:25.350 --> 38:27.189
What's going on? What's happening?

38:28.014 --> 38:29.075
Toodles!

38:31.059 --> 38:32.698
Is there anything you
want to say to me?

38:33.401 --> 38:35.432
If I hadn't shown up at the
crime scene in the first place,

38:35.433 --> 38:37.513
you never would have known
there were three more suspects.

38:37.514 --> 38:38.769
I'm happy.

38:38.770 --> 38:39.850
I'm happy that you were there

38:39.851 --> 38:41.564
to help me with my investigation.

38:43.019 --> 38:43.852
And?

38:43.853 --> 38:45.107
And thank you.

38:46.811 --> 38:47.616
But...

38:47.617 --> 38:48.863
Ah, ah, ah.

38:49.376 --> 38:50.704
You were doing so well.

38:59.340 --> 39:00.068
Come in.

39:01.524 --> 39:04.058
Here's the apology to
Detective Hayward's

39:04.059 --> 39:05.204
union rep you asked for.

39:05.205 --> 39:06.252
I noted your objection

39:06.253 --> 39:08.483
to holding him at the beginning
of the letter and the end.

39:09.378 --> 39:09.978
Good.

39:09.979 --> 39:11.057
Glad that's over.

39:12.479 --> 39:13.685
Wait. Wait, wait.

39:16.593 --> 39:17.780
I-I just...

39:20.096 --> 39:20.692
I wish I could handle

39:20.693 --> 39:23.765
this whole selection
process some other way.

39:25.732 --> 39:26.611
You know.

39:26.612 --> 39:27.563
Some...

39:28.620 --> 39:29.899
Better way.

39:31.186 --> 39:32.281
It's okay, Will.

39:32.282 --> 39:33.195
It's fine.

39:35.881 --> 39:37.610
My hope is that, uh...

39:38.746 --> 39:41.578
You know, when this whole
thing is over, we can...

39:42.689 --> 39:43.802
Somehow, you know,

39:43.803 --> 39:46.967
find some way to -
to keep our relationship.

39:46.968 --> 39:47.986
We will.

39:47.987 --> 39:50.346
We... We will.

39:58.868 --> 39:59.740
Wait, wait.

40:03.901 --> 40:04.670
Chief Pope.

40:06.391 --> 40:07.416
Uh-huh.

40:08.191 --> 40:10.183
Good. Finally.

40:11.048 --> 40:12.111
And?

40:13.168 --> 40:14.345
Uh-huh.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.498
Uh-huh. Him I expected.

40:18.370 --> 40:19.642
Who else?

40:20.042 --> 40:20.771
Uh-huh.

40:22.577 --> 40:23.520
Uh-huh.

40:26.161 --> 40:27.075
Okay.

40:28.614 --> 40:29.274
Thanks.

40:29.275 --> 40:30.170
I appreciate it.

40:31.283 --> 40:32.072
Yeah. Bye.

40:36.720 --> 40:37.767
Will?

40:39.690 --> 40:41.526
Well, the short list is out...

40:42.192 --> 40:43.319
And you're on it.

40:45.227 --> 40:47.030
And...I'm not.

40:47.896 --> 40:49.375
You're kidding.

40:50.717 --> 40:51.708
Oh, Will.

40:51.709 --> 40:53.564
I'm... I'm so sorry.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.003
And, uh, you'll be getting a call

40:58.004 --> 40:59.306
any minute now, and, uh,

40:59.307 --> 41:00.682
there are reporters downstairs...

41:00.683 --> 41:03.554
I don't even want the job
to begin with. Well...

41:03.555 --> 41:04.898
I'm never gonna get appointed.

41:04.899 --> 41:06.959
No, no, just... go ahead. Please.
Just... I should just drop out.

41:06.960 --> 41:07.886
Please get out!

41:10.091 --> 41:11.289
Please.

41:18.890 --> 41:20.688
Take that outside...

41:23.427 --> 41:24.289
...And go.

41:29.634 --> 41:30.593
Please.

41:56.056 --> 41:57.897
Deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
