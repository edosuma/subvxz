WEBVTT

00:02.970 --> 00:05.606
There-- a finished
jack-o'-lantern...

00:05.606 --> 00:07.841
with a seriously
deviated septum.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.348
Hey, you guys are
just in time to carve
pumpkins with me.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.749
And you're about
12 years too late.

00:15.749 --> 00:19.720
I haven't carved a pumpkin
since I was... six.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.122
Miles, you'll carve a pumpkin
with me, right?

00:22.122 --> 00:24.558
And perpetuate one
of the most ridiculous

00:24.558 --> 00:26.760
bogus holidays ever
invented by man?

00:26.760 --> 00:27.761
I'll take that as a no.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.463
I can't believe <i>you're</i>
dissing Halloween--

00:29.463 --> 00:30.430
the same guy
who sits in his room

00:30.430 --> 00:32.699
waiting to be picked up
by aliens.

00:32.699 --> 00:33.767
That's not true.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.702
I <i>contact</i> them
from my room.

00:35.702 --> 00:40.073
I <i>wait</i> on the roof.

00:40.073 --> 00:42.509
Well, I guess
it's just you and me, Jack.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.411
I'm up for some fun, baby.

00:44.411 --> 00:47.748
Let's grab a bottle
of Colt 45 and put
on some Luther.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.983
Don't mess with me, Jack.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.791
I hope the rest of you saw that.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.633
IBM down an eighth?

01:39.633 --> 01:42.302
I'm going to scratch
Alan Greenspan's eyes out.

01:42.302 --> 01:43.570
Hey, everybody, I'm home.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.072
Sabrina, what are
you doing here?

01:45.072 --> 01:47.574
Oh, your favorite niece can't
just drop by to say hello?

01:47.574 --> 01:48.842
How much laundry do
you have?

01:48.842 --> 01:52.412
Three bags,
but I've also got good news.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.781
This Halloween I'm going to
spend the holiday with you guys.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.984
You're what?
You can't.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.919
Nothing like being embraced
in the bosom of your family

01:58.919 --> 02:00.654
on the most special day
of the year.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.222
( <i>snickering</i> ):
"Bosom."

02:02.222 --> 02:03.924
You said "bosom."

02:03.924 --> 02:04.891
( <i>laughing</i> )

02:04.891 --> 02:05.826
I'm sorry,
Sabrina

02:05.826 --> 02:07.227
it's just
that you're never interested

02:07.227 --> 02:09.997
in spending the holiday with us,
so we made other plans.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.398
We got invited to
the Other Realm

02:11.398 --> 02:14.735
for the ultra-exclusive
opening of a new galaxy.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.136
Oh, that sound fun
and Halloweeny.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.971
Think you could wangle me
an invitation?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.539
Salem:
Get a clue,
sister.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.708
You and I are persona non grata.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.844
They're going to abandon us
on Halloween.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.680
Quick! Someone say "bosom."

02:26.680 --> 02:28.482
I suppose we could
cancel if you want us to.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.584
Oh, no, no, no,
you guys go ahead.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.052
You know, I'll just
hang out with Miles

02:32.052 --> 02:33.954
and wait for the mother ship
to beam us up.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.056
Say to the Android
Sisters for us.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.158
Let's go figure out
what to wear to the
galaxy opening.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.595
I am thinking heat-resistant
metal with a skosh of Spandex.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.430
Maybe,I'll wear what I wore
to the Shoenman bar mitzvah.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.831
They had that
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i> theme.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.401
Oh!

02:47.401 --> 02:49.736
Well, at least while I'm doing
nothing on Halloween

02:49.736 --> 02:51.405
I'll be wearing clean underwear.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.472
Are you doing
delicates?

02:52.472 --> 02:55.542
Because I've got
a few things
to toss in.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.577
I'll do them by hand.

02:57.577 --> 02:59.346
You know,
it's the weirdest thing.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.715
I can't think of anything
but Halloween these days.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.216
What's that about?

03:03.216 --> 03:04.918
I know-- I have no life.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.887
And then there's
the whole witch thing.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.321
You know, after all these years
of rebellion

03:08.321 --> 03:10.791
I'm finally ready
to embrace the truth.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.192
Halloween is
in my blood.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.494
Say it loud
and say it proud!

03:14.494 --> 03:16.096
Time for me to put on
the orange and black

03:16.096 --> 03:17.397
and show the
world who I am.

03:17.397 --> 03:18.699
Hallelujah, sister!

03:18.699 --> 03:19.599
Amen, brother!

03:19.599 --> 03:21.134
We're having a party!

03:21.134 --> 03:22.169
I didn't say that.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.570
Oh... so you're one

03:23.570 --> 03:26.206
of those witches who celebrates
Halloween the other way--

03:26.206 --> 03:28.742
staying home and being a loser.

03:28.742 --> 03:29.710
I would love
to have a party

03:29.710 --> 03:32.112
but Miles and Roxie
hate Halloween.

03:32.112 --> 03:33.046
It's amazing
the ugly things

03:33.046 --> 03:34.715
you learn about people
when you live with them.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.383
Which reminds me,
aren't your aunts

03:36.383 --> 03:37.951
going out
Halloween night?

03:37.951 --> 03:40.220
Why don't you have
the party here?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.388
They would never
let me have a party here

03:41.388 --> 03:42.489
when they're not home.

03:42.489 --> 03:45.459
Girlfriend, aren't you learning
anything in college?

03:45.459 --> 03:46.893
Don't tell them.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.562
They'd kill me
if I had a party.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.598
I can't. I couldn't.
I shouldn't.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.066
Is it too late to send out
invitations?

03:55.869 --> 03:57.137
So don't say anything
to my Aunt Hilda

03:57.137 --> 03:58.839
but I'm going
to have a little
Halloween celebration

03:58.839 --> 04:00.974
for a few
of my close friends.

04:00.974 --> 04:01.908
I'm there.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.677
And that guy
I've never met before.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.112
I'm always up for a party.

04:05.112 --> 04:09.082
In fact,
I've got seven that night.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.717
Well, mine is going
to be great--

04:10.717 --> 04:12.252
a classic
Halloween celebration

04:12.252 --> 04:16.289
with costumes, spooky lighting,
bobbing for apples.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.893
Like I said, seven
parties is plenty.

04:19.893 --> 04:23.029
Bobbing for apples?

04:23.029 --> 04:24.431
Or pears.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.333
You know, bring your own fruit--
I'm flexible.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.801
Sabrina, when are you
going to get it?

04:27.801 --> 04:31.404
There's nothing more
lame than Halloween,
and I know lame.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.572
He's got you there.

04:32.572 --> 04:35.375
Okay, listen up and listen good,
you Hallo-whiners.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.477
All right, holidays give us
a reason to celebrate.

04:37.477 --> 04:39.546
On Christmas,
we get to put up decorations.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.214
On New Year's,
we party all night long.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.283
Thanksgiving,
we eat until we puke

04:43.283 --> 04:44.484
but on Halloween

04:44.484 --> 04:46.853
we get to do all of those things
while wearing a silly costume.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.655
It may not mean much to you,
but it means a lot to me

04:48.655 --> 04:51.024
and I expect every one of you
to show up.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.325
I'll be there.

04:52.325 --> 04:53.827
Where am I going?

04:53.827 --> 04:55.562
To the best Halloween
party of all time.

04:55.562 --> 04:59.633
We get to bring
our own fruit.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.569
Let me get this straight--
three days before Halloween

05:02.569 --> 05:05.472
and you want me
to plan the best
party of all time?

05:05.472 --> 05:08.074
Well, that's why
I came to the best
party planner of all time.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.710
Ooh, a suck-up... I like it.

05:10.710 --> 05:13.013
Too bad
it ain't gonna get you squat.

05:13.013 --> 05:13.947
Look, Joyce, I know

05:13.947 --> 05:15.849
this is the biggest holiday
in the Other Realm

05:15.849 --> 05:17.217
but I'm desperate.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.186
Can you just give me
some monsters?

05:19.186 --> 05:20.887
Let's see...

05:20.887 --> 05:26.193
( <i>typing furiously on keyboard)</i>

05:26.193 --> 05:28.261
No monsters, but I can get you

05:28.261 --> 05:30.931
a one-way to Phoenix
with a connection in Denver.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.899
Let's call that Plan B.

05:32.899 --> 05:39.873
Honey, all I can give you
is the basic Ghoul Package.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.174
Not very exciting

05:41.174 --> 05:44.311
but it does come with...

05:44.311 --> 05:46.079
a free bucket of pus.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.147
Do you have anything
a little scarier?

05:47.147 --> 05:50.617
That one guy
seems scared of me.

05:50.617 --> 05:53.153
Look, I have to kick
some major Halloween butt.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.988
I have to prove
to a house full of skeptics

05:54.988 --> 05:56.556
that this holiday rocks.

05:56.556 --> 05:59.726
Okay, tell you what,
got a big fella who owes me.

05:59.726 --> 06:04.397
How about the Creature
from the Black Lagoon?

06:04.397 --> 06:07.601
Oh, that won't work.
None of our furniture
is scotchgarded.

06:07.601 --> 06:11.538
He loses a lot of gigs that way.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.039
Hold the phone.

06:13.039 --> 06:17.811
You'll never guess
who just became available.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.679
( <i>growling</i> )

06:19.679 --> 06:21.114
Frankenstein!
That's perfect!

06:21.114 --> 06:23.750
I mean, sure, he's got
a criminal record.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.485
Frank usually doesn't
work on Halloween.

06:25.485 --> 06:26.920
He must need the money.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.288
Gambling problem.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.222
I'll take him.

06:29.222 --> 06:29.890
And if you have

06:29.890 --> 06:30.957
any buddies with
massive debts

06:30.957 --> 06:32.125
you know,
bring them along.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.193
( <i>growling</i> )

06:35.228 --> 06:37.130
Okay, the food is hidden,
the drinks are on ice.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.599
Everything's ready to
go except my aunts.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.067
Aunt Hilda, Aunt
Zelda, hurry up!

06:41.067 --> 06:42.702
You're going to be
late for your party.

06:42.702 --> 06:44.004
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

06:44.004 --> 06:47.374
Obviously not a problem
for your guests.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.508
I can't believe
they're here already.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.043
I'll get it!

06:50.043 --> 06:52.078
Go away! You're early!

06:52.078 --> 06:53.480
Oh, sorry, I didn't meant it.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.483
Here!

06:56.483 --> 06:59.085
Oh! Sorry again!

06:59.085 --> 07:00.387
Zelda:
Sabrina, we're leaving.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.222
So soon?
I'll go up and make sure

07:02.222 --> 07:05.892
they get to their galaxy
at warp speed.

07:05.892 --> 07:06.860
Well, have a good time.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.894
Stay out as long as you like.

07:07.894 --> 07:09.896
Dance until those stars
burn out.

07:09.896 --> 07:10.697
That's it?

07:10.697 --> 07:11.865
Sabrina, we spent
three hours

07:11.865 --> 07:13.533
getting ready
for this galaxy opening.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.869
Don't you have anything
to say about our outfits?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.804
Titanium-- that's the new black.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.040
Now you crazy kids
get out of here.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.641
Why are you in such a
hurry for us to leave?

07:21.641 --> 07:23.209
Oh, well, the sooner you leave,
the sooner I can throw

07:23.209 --> 07:26.746
that wild, crazy party
I've been planning in secret.

07:26.746 --> 07:27.814
Good one.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.853
( <i>thunder and lightning</i> )

07:33.853 --> 07:35.588
Okay, now all I have to do
is change into my costume

07:35.588 --> 07:36.656
and I'm ready.

07:40.894 --> 07:41.795
( <i>giggling</i> )

07:41.795 --> 07:43.330
What a lame getup.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.965
Oh, Miss Bo Peep

07:44.965 --> 07:46.666
it seems you've lost your sheep.

07:46.666 --> 07:49.502
I haven't lost him.
He's right here.

07:49.502 --> 07:50.570
( <i>gasps</i> )

07:50.570 --> 07:53.707
I can't pick up college chicks
looking like this.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.077
On the other hand,
I'm so soft and fuzzy...

07:57.077 --> 08:00.246
Baa!

08:00.246 --> 08:04.050
( <i>music playing</i> )

08:04.050 --> 08:04.918
Well, I'd say
the party's going

08:04.918 --> 08:06.386
pretty darn well,
wouldn't you?

08:06.386 --> 08:08.154
Going well for yours truly.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.390
Muffy's treating me
to some heavy petting.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.225
In your dreams, Lambchop.

08:12.225 --> 08:15.328
Sabrina, your cat is adorable.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.097
And so friendly.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.031
( <i>laughing</i> )

08:18.031 --> 08:20.600
Little tip? Candy Corn
makes him gassy.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.335
( <i>Salem sobbing</i> )

08:24.738 --> 08:26.139
Hey, guys, having fun?

08:26.139 --> 08:27.540
I'm standing
here with Miles.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.775
What do you think?

08:28.775 --> 08:30.677
If <i>this</i> is the best party
of all time

08:30.677 --> 08:32.979
I'm glad I'm a social outcast.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.647
Come on, guys,
get in the party spirit.

08:34.647 --> 08:35.648
Bob for something.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.283
Okay, I'll bob for the door.

08:37.283 --> 08:38.218
I'll bob with you.

08:38.218 --> 08:38.985
Wait, wait, wait--

08:38.985 --> 08:40.520
nobody leaves
a party at 8:55.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.088
Well, we're off, Sabrina.

08:42.088 --> 08:44.524
Thanks, it was
really fun.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.659
Then why are you
leaving after
only 20 minutes?

08:46.659 --> 08:48.828
Why are we leaving
after only 20 minutes?

08:48.828 --> 08:52.899
Because we decided
it was rude to
leave after 15.

08:52.899 --> 08:56.036
Thanks, Spellman,
for the best party
of all time.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.103
No, you can't go.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.872
Look, something's
going to happen
any minute now.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.674
What, you're going to bring out
the cheese platter?

09:01.674 --> 09:05.211
( <i>thunder and lightning</i> )

09:05.211 --> 09:06.713
( <i>growling</i> )

09:06.713 --> 09:09.949
( <i>screaming</i> )

09:09.949 --> 09:12.285
( <i>applauding</i> )

09:12.285 --> 09:15.555
I'd say that beats
Gouda on a Trisket.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.657
Hilda, everyone's gawking at us.

09:17.657 --> 09:20.293
Of course they are.
They can't believe
how fabulous we look.

09:20.293 --> 09:24.030
Sir, would you mind not staring
at my planets?

09:24.030 --> 09:28.368
Let's just play it low-key
and try to fit in.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.438
( <i>loud clattering and rattling)</i>

09:34.074 --> 09:36.476
Is this a fabulous
new galaxy or what?

09:36.476 --> 09:38.845
This galaxy's a dump.

09:38.845 --> 09:39.979
Someone's not
in a party mood.

09:39.979 --> 09:41.381
No, it really is a dump.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.415
They built it as a landfill

09:42.415 --> 09:45.051
for all the junk
floating around in space.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.420
Are you telling me
we got all dressed
up to go to a dump?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.556
Say "landfill."
It sounds much better.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.658
When you have a chance,
could you get me another?

09:51.658 --> 09:53.493
Shaken, not stirred.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.728
Sorry, double-oh-zero,
we don't work here.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.597
We're invited,
just like everybody else.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.866
Yes, I heard
they had to scrape bottom

09:59.866 --> 10:02.302
to fill out the guest list.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.904
You know, this is nothing like
the opening of the Crab Nebula.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.840
That was a classy affair.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.041
We weren't there.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.944
I know.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.146
Euro-trash.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.348
I've always wanted
to call someone that.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.583
( <i>music playing</i> )

10:16.583 --> 10:18.251
So, you like the
music? It's funk.

10:18.251 --> 10:21.788
Oh, but I guess
you prefer wrap.

10:21.788 --> 10:22.889
Great costume.

10:22.889 --> 10:25.358
I love the fake eye.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.228
( <i>music continues</i> )

10:28.228 --> 10:29.829
That was some grand
entrance you made.

10:29.829 --> 10:30.964
( <i>growling</i> )

10:30.964 --> 10:32.265
I'm better
at grand exits.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.500
People applaud
when I leave.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.335
( <i>growling</i> )

10:35.335 --> 10:36.469
Hey, how's it going?

10:36.469 --> 10:38.505
He's not much of a talker.
I like that.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.339
Color me shocked.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.308
I would never have
put you two together.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.544
Hey, hey, hey,
let's keep it
clean, Cyclops.

10:44.544 --> 10:45.645
No flashing.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.547
I can't figure out
how he does that.

10:47.547 --> 10:50.116
Sabrina, you are
the Queen of Halloween.

10:50.116 --> 10:53.086
Well, I prefer to
think of myself as
humble shepherdess.

10:53.086 --> 10:56.022
Excuse me while I
tend to my flock.

10:56.022 --> 10:57.390
I got to hand it
to you, Spellman.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.058
For a girl who
still carves pumpkins

10:59.058 --> 11:00.527
you know how
to have fun.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.795
This is the greatest
party of all time.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.097
You said that before.

11:04.097 --> 11:07.767
Yeah, but this is
one of the rare times
that I'm being sincere.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.236
How about when you told me
I was a great kisser?

11:10.236 --> 11:11.738
We'll talk.

11:11.738 --> 11:14.507
Look, I'm telling you, dude,
forget about the Other Realm.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.942
This party is raging.

11:15.942 --> 11:16.976
Look, call everybody

11:16.976 --> 11:18.878
and tell them to their
decaying butts over here.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.113
Later.

11:20.113 --> 11:24.417
( <i>music continues</i> )

11:24.417 --> 11:25.852
( <i>laughing</i> )

11:25.852 --> 11:28.588
Why are you leading me
toward the bedroom, kitty?

11:28.588 --> 11:31.691
Do you want to show me
your little mousie?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.760
( <i>thunder and lightning</i> )

11:33.760 --> 11:36.029
( <i>screaming</i> )

11:36.029 --> 11:39.899
( <i>ghoulish laughter</i> )

11:39.899 --> 11:42.001
( <i>grunting and growling</i> )

11:47.607 --> 11:49.876
Trick or treat.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.144
Oh, Joyce threw in
a few extra ghouls.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.881
Cool!

11:54.881 --> 11:57.951
Oh, more ghouls. Great!

12:00.253 --> 12:01.521
A truckload of ghouls.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.122
Could be a problem.

12:03.122 --> 12:07.126
( <i>music continues</i> )

12:23.042 --> 12:26.613
( <i>music plays</i> )

12:26.613 --> 12:28.414
Hey, hey, hey!
No ghouls on the ottoman!

12:28.414 --> 12:29.716
And, you! If you're
going to shove

12:29.716 --> 12:31.851
deviled eggs up your nose,
keep them there!

12:31.851 --> 12:35.088
Hey, turn it down!
You're killing my ears!

12:35.088 --> 12:36.823
Here's a spare.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.226
Wild party, Sabrina.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.828
Yeah, whoo-hoo.

12:41.828 --> 12:42.862
Those ghouls know

12:42.862 --> 12:43.896
how to party.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.164
They must be Phi Delts.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.634
Hey! No juggling Waterford!

12:47.634 --> 12:48.534
This is my aunts' house

12:48.534 --> 12:50.370
and we have to respect
their property!

12:50.370 --> 12:52.605
( <i>shattering</i> )
That was
a discontinued pattern.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.240
I am so dead.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.110
Been there...
Still there.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.118
The place is clearing out.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.220
And my Jupiter is all sticky.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.355
Looks like there's
some kind of after-party.

13:09.355 --> 13:13.026
Hey, Mr. Nose-in-the-Air,
where's everybody going?

13:13.026 --> 13:15.128
Some place <i>very</i> exclusive.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.829
I'm sure I won't
see <i>you</i> there.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.731
( <i>whines</i> )

13:18.731 --> 13:21.034
Isn't it awful the way people
get left out of things?

13:21.034 --> 13:24.470
I'd love to chat,
but I just got invited
to a very exclusive party.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.106
Would you mind?

13:27.106 --> 13:28.274
Interesting.

13:28.274 --> 13:30.276
At home you won't
even pick up a sponge

13:30.276 --> 13:31.110
but here...

13:31.110 --> 13:32.912
I'm not cleaning up.
I'm going home.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.013
But I am taking the mop.

13:34.013 --> 13:35.815
I think you'll
really like it.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.917
( <i>thundering</i> )

13:37.917 --> 13:39.519
What happened to the door?

13:39.519 --> 13:41.287
And what are
all these people doing here?

13:41.287 --> 13:43.956
And why, once again,
do I feel overdressed?

13:43.956 --> 13:45.024
Here. This will help.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.793
Man:
I mean what
are the odds

13:46.793 --> 13:48.995
of going to two
different dumps
in one night?

13:48.995 --> 13:51.597
( <i>laughs</i> )
Excuse me.

13:51.597 --> 13:52.999
But this is <i>our</i> dump.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.834
Say "landfill."
It sounds much better.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.369
And what are
you doing here?

13:56.369 --> 13:58.237
You, you...

13:58.237 --> 13:59.706
You meanie!

13:59.706 --> 14:00.740
Meanie?

14:00.740 --> 14:03.076
I was told that a raging soiree
was being thrown

14:03.076 --> 14:05.178
by someone named Sabrina.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.946
Sabrina?

14:06.946 --> 14:08.681
Sabrina!
Sabrina!

14:08.681 --> 14:10.350
This place is a total disaster!

14:10.350 --> 14:14.253
And... who didn't use
a coaster?!

14:14.253 --> 14:15.722
The water stain on
the piano is the least

14:15.722 --> 14:17.457
of your problems
right now.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.292
But it's the only one
I know how to solve.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.728
All right!
Everybody out!
Party's over!

14:21.728 --> 14:23.830
Except you.
You're cute.

14:23.830 --> 14:27.300
And... buff.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.635
Okay, everybody leave
exactly the way you came

14:29.635 --> 14:30.770
except for Joyce's people!

14:30.770 --> 14:32.205
I have to return
you myself!

14:32.205 --> 14:33.373
Joyce's people?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.174
You used the Other Realm
party planner?

14:35.174 --> 14:36.743
Oh, you are
in <i>so</i> deep.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.444
Throwing a party
behind our backs.

14:38.444 --> 14:41.114
Well, technically I did tell you
about the party before you left.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.216
I have half a mind
to take away your magic.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.184
And the other half
to take away your credit card.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.687
And the other half...
Oh, sorry.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.589
Look, I know
this looks bad...

14:49.589 --> 14:50.757
and way over
our deductible

14:50.757 --> 14:52.792
but the idea came
from a good place.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.361
I <i>was</i> in a good
place, Muffy's lap

14:55.361 --> 14:57.196
until you two botched it.

14:57.196 --> 14:59.732
Luckily, she left her scrunchie.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.334
( <i>sniffing</i> )

15:01.334 --> 15:02.902
( <i>moans pleasurably</i> )

15:02.902 --> 15:04.604
Look, everybody I know was
dissing Halloween

15:04.604 --> 15:07.306
and as a witch, I felt I should
stand up for our holiday.

15:07.306 --> 15:08.941
You know, defend our heritage.

15:08.941 --> 15:11.244
Oh, apparently
not our stemware.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.745
Your intentions
may have been noble

15:12.745 --> 15:14.480
but your actions
were inexcusable.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.915
Not only were you sneaky

15:15.915 --> 15:17.850
but you mixed mortals
with Other Realm creatures

15:17.850 --> 15:19.152
without our supervision.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.887
I know. You're right.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.321
I don't know
what I was thinking.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.157
I <i>wasn't</i> thinking.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.525
I'm really sorry.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.627
Look, before this turns
into an after-school special

15:27.627 --> 15:29.695
you should know
we're about to go
into overtime.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.831
Could I continue my apology
after I get back?

15:31.831 --> 15:35.067
Fine. This mess will be waiting
for you, and so will we.

15:35.067 --> 15:37.069
Well, you know, if you feel
like cleaning up a little

15:37.069 --> 15:38.438
before I get back...

15:38.438 --> 15:41.174
Don't you dare!

15:41.174 --> 15:43.276
Let's go! Out!

15:43.276 --> 15:44.577
Come on!
( <i>thumps cane</i> )

15:45.411 --> 15:48.748
One ghoul, one pirate,
one mummy...

15:48.748 --> 15:49.615
Wait a minute.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.117
The pirate is
missing an ear.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.819
Oh, I got it right here.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.220
Oh, don't mind the gum.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.489
A little lighter fluid will take
that right off.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.158
Oh, and the cyclops is
also missing a foot.

15:59.158 --> 16:02.195
Oh, darn! We were using it
to stir the punch.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.831
Unless you find it,
I'm going to have to charge you.

16:04.831 --> 16:05.431
Now

16:05.431 --> 16:06.966
where's my Frankenstein?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.434
Frankenstein?

16:08.434 --> 16:11.003
Tall guy, square head,
hates fire.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.004
I know <i>who</i> he is.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.340
I just...
don't know where he is.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.309
Ow... Ow!

16:16.309 --> 16:17.310
Ow!

16:17.310 --> 16:17.944
Ow!

16:17.944 --> 16:19.178
Ow!

16:19.178 --> 16:20.613
See? That wasn't so bad.

16:20.613 --> 16:24.450
Oh, that is the last time you
use actual meteors in my hair.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.618
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda!

16:25.618 --> 16:27.220
Have you seen Frankenstein?

16:27.220 --> 16:28.488
Years ago,
at the drive-in.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.556
I always wondered:
was there a lot of
fog in that movie

16:30.556 --> 16:32.091
or just on the windshield?

16:32.091 --> 16:33.059
Oh, not the movie.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.228
The real Frankenstein,
I rented him for my party

16:35.228 --> 16:36.295
and now I've lost him.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.297
You've lost a creature
from the Other Realm?

16:38.297 --> 16:39.866
You better hope
he's still in the house.

16:39.866 --> 16:40.933
Hilda, you check
the basement.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.169
I'll cover the upstairs.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.605
And I'll check the kitchen
and... the moors.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.309
Salem, have you seen
Frankenstein?

16:50.309 --> 16:51.244
Ah.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.012
It was the summer of '42.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.481
I was having my illicit fling
with Eleanor Roosevelt...

16:55.481 --> 16:58.017
No, not the movie.
The actual Frankenstein.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.652
He left with Roxie.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.587
Looking very cozy, I might add.

17:01.587 --> 17:02.989
They left?!
Why didn't you stop them?!

17:02.989 --> 17:04.090
I was busy!

17:04.090 --> 17:04.857
Doing what?!

17:04.857 --> 17:06.826
Playing with my scrunchie.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.594
( <i>giggling</i> )

17:08.594 --> 17:10.162
Oh, God...

17:11.597 --> 17:13.099
Sabrina:
<i>Roxie, have you seen</i>
<i>Frankenstein?</i>

17:13.099 --> 17:14.734
And I'm not talking
about the movie.

17:14.734 --> 17:15.968
Frankie's in the bathroom.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.036
He's so cute.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.605
I think he needed
to "tighten his bolts."

17:21.774 --> 17:23.442
Roxie, look, you got to forget
about this guy.

17:23.442 --> 17:25.645
Believe me, he's not like
any guy you've ever dated.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.246
I know.
That's what I like about him.

17:27.246 --> 17:30.116
He's offbeat, quirky,
rough around the edges.

17:30.116 --> 17:33.519
( <i>growling</i> )

17:33.519 --> 17:34.720
Uh, maybe a little too rough.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.222
Frank, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.790
Look, we got to get
your costume back

17:37.790 --> 17:39.825
to Joyce's rental
place <i>now.</i>

17:39.825 --> 17:40.726
Can't it wait?!

17:40.726 --> 17:42.228
I was just about to light
a fire.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.463
( <i>growls</i> )
Not a good idea.
Come on, Frank.

17:44.463 --> 17:45.364
What about our date?

17:45.364 --> 17:46.866
Are we still on
for next Saturday?

17:46.866 --> 17:48.067
( <i>growls</i> )

17:48.067 --> 17:49.101
You've got my number!

17:49.101 --> 17:50.069
( <i>growls</i> )

17:52.972 --> 17:54.607
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda,
I found him!

17:54.607 --> 17:56.642
Oh, thank goodness.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.611
He was about to put the moves
on Roxie.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.580
Shame on you.
You're a married man.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.281
Of course.
He's married?

18:02.281 --> 18:03.849
To the Bride
of Frankenstein.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.484
A lot of fog
in that movie, too.

18:05.484 --> 18:06.852
Or was there?

18:10.323 --> 18:13.459
Hurry up! Get in there!

18:13.459 --> 18:15.294
Did you use my apricot
body splash?

18:15.294 --> 18:17.897
( <i>growls</i> )

18:17.897 --> 18:20.833
( <i>thundering</i> )

18:20.833 --> 18:21.701
Just what I need.

18:21.701 --> 18:22.868
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda!

18:22.868 --> 18:24.604
The linen closet isn't working!

18:24.604 --> 18:26.606
Oh, I'll call Other Realm
plumbing in Portal.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.240
I hope they don't send that
guy with the butt crack.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.509
Wait. Maybe there's nothing
wrong with the closet.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.745
Maybe someone is refusing
to go back.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.181
( <i>growling</i> )

18:35.181 --> 18:36.582
Sorry, I didn't get that.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.050
He's having problems
with the missus.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.685
Well, every marriage
has problems.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.054
That's no excuse
for you to go chasing coeds.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.356
( <i>growls</i> )

18:43.356 --> 18:44.690
I'll handle this.

18:44.690 --> 18:45.658
Frankenstein

18:45.658 --> 18:46.792
you're going to work
things out with your wife

18:46.792 --> 18:49.228
by hook or by crook.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.531
Oh, so that's what
that thing's for.

18:52.531 --> 18:55.434
Mm-hmm.

18:55.434 --> 18:56.802
( <i>thundering</i> )

18:58.904 --> 19:01.507
Wow, pretty ratty digs
for a movie star.

19:01.507 --> 19:04.243
I heard his business manager
took him to the cleaners.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.779
( <i>growling</i> )

19:06.779 --> 19:08.748
Oh, no wonder he wanted to stay
in the mortal realm.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.950
( <i>both growling</i> )

19:10.950 --> 19:12.084
Aunt Hilda
What are they saying?

19:12.084 --> 19:13.619
You're much too young
to hear.

19:13.619 --> 19:14.654
( <i>both growling</i> )

19:14.654 --> 19:16.555
Oh, the mouths
on those two.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.025
Obviously they're
having trouble
communicating.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.027
Since Sabrina's paying
the overtime rate

19:21.027 --> 19:23.462
let these two communicate.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.765
We never go out.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.266
Oh, that must be
frustrating.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.301
I mean, you're here all day
doing

19:29.301 --> 19:32.038
you know, whatever it is
you monster brides do.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.839
Why don't you take
her out to dinner
once in a while?

19:33.839 --> 19:36.042
I'm tired
when I get home from work.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.344
All that walking around,
my arms straight out?

19:38.344 --> 19:39.545
Maybe you could try walking
with your arms

19:39.545 --> 19:41.347
at your sides.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.251
And maybe <i>you</i> could try

19:45.251 --> 19:46.886
rubbing his shoulders
once in a while.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.387
That would be nice.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.259
Ooh. That's good.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.027
This is where the fog
usually shows up.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.762
Oh, why didn't I bring a date?

19:56.762 --> 19:59.231
Why don't we stay in
tonight?

19:59.231 --> 20:01.434
Mm, yes.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.803
Show's over.
We're out of here.

20:05.504 --> 20:08.274
( <i>thundering</i> )

20:08.274 --> 20:11.277
Well, we got Frankenstein back
to his house.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.212
Now all you have to do
is clean <i>ours.</i>

20:13.212 --> 20:14.814
Of course, but first I have
to explain to Roxie

20:14.814 --> 20:17.983
why her date for Saturday night
isn't going to show up.

20:17.983 --> 20:19.385
Anybody got
a good excuse?

20:19.385 --> 20:20.753
Why don't you tell
her the truth?

20:20.753 --> 20:23.322
That I'm witch and I rented
actual monsters for my party

20:23.322 --> 20:24.490
and that was the real
Frankenstein

20:24.490 --> 20:25.891
she was about to cuddle up with?

20:25.891 --> 20:27.893
I meant the other truth.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.261
He's married?

20:29.261 --> 20:30.396
I'm afraid so.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.797
What's his wife like?

20:31.797 --> 20:34.834
Oh, shrieky voice, big hair,
bad highlights.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.802
I knew he was too
good to be true.

20:36.802 --> 20:38.537
I'm sorry. I never should've
dragged you to my party.

20:38.537 --> 20:41.807
No, it's okay. I had fun,
and so did everybody else.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.110
We're actually looking forward
to next Halloween.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.011
Well, I guess I accomplished
my mission then--

20:46.011 --> 20:49.615
I made people appreciate
what a meaningful holiday it is.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.183
Look what I found
in the punch bowl
at your party!

20:51.183 --> 20:52.485
I think it's a real human foot!

20:52.485 --> 20:54.120
This is so cool!

20:54.120 --> 20:56.522
Don't get too attached!
It's rented!

21:05.564 --> 21:06.899
Hi, Sabrina.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.000
Muffy, are you
all right?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.702
I mean, your message was kind
of garbled on my machine.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.837
Something about
a stalker?

21:14.140 --> 21:17.276
I found him pawing through
my lingerie drawer.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.612
Oh, I'm so sorry.
He's a sick, sick animal.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.181
But that'll all change
once I have him fixed.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.150
Salem:
Meow?

21:24.150 --> 21:26.218
You-You were
joking, right?

21:26.218 --> 21:27.086
( <i>laughs nervously</i> )

21:27.086 --> 21:28.554
Right?

21:28.554 --> 21:30.322
<i>Hey, this isn't the way home!</i>
