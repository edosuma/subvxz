WEBVTT

00:02.334 --> 00:04.250
I hope to have a stewardess
before the following charter.

00:04.250 --> 00:07.083
Being a man down...

00:07.083 --> 00:08.584
Just remember,
whoever comes in...

00:08.584 --> 00:09.417
I know.

00:09.417 --> 00:10.959
...they might be your
second stew.

00:10.959 --> 00:14.459
Maybe she claims rank.

00:14.459 --> 00:15.709
Bye-bye.

00:15.709 --> 00:16.959
Are you the new deckhand?

00:16.959 --> 00:18.584
I am, I'm Barnaby.

00:18.584 --> 00:20.417
You've come just in
the nick of time.

00:20.417 --> 00:22.584
Put the lazy sheet against
the halyard

00:22.584 --> 00:24.417
so there's tension on
the capstan... perfect.

00:24.417 --> 00:26.042
It's great to see
that my deck team

00:26.042 --> 00:27.626
is finally shaping up nicely.

00:27.626 --> 00:29.083
I want a bacon Bloody Mary.

00:29.083 --> 00:30.125
Do you have tequila?

00:30.125 --> 00:32.751
I'd like a Transfusion.

00:32.751 --> 00:35.792
Yeah, we can.

00:35.792 --> 00:37.375
We have, uh...

00:37.375 --> 00:39.959
It's hard to concentrate
when she have her nipple

00:39.959 --> 00:41.751
saying, "Hello, Marcos."

00:41.751 --> 00:44.459
No, no, no, honestly
I can't accept... oh.

00:44.459 --> 00:45.792
He can take that
----ing euro note

00:45.792 --> 00:49.375
and shove it so far up his hole.

00:49.375 --> 00:54.584
I've been working for
more than 15 hours.

00:54.584 --> 00:56.375
I just wanted to check
that you're still on

00:56.375 --> 01:06.501
for dinner in 10 minutes.

01:06.501 --> 01:07.709
Ah.

01:07.709 --> 01:09.542
This is bullsh--.

01:09.542 --> 01:17.125
One plate, two...
what happened?

01:17.125 --> 01:18.375
You look ----ing tired.

01:18.375 --> 01:24.083
You've got huge bags
under your eyes.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.209
I'm European, and
I don't look like that,

01:26.209 --> 01:27.959
I look fresh as a daisy.

01:27.959 --> 01:32.918
Let the countdown begin.

01:32.918 --> 01:33.959
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:33.959 --> 01:35.000
See you at, what, 6:00?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.375
Yeah.

01:36.375 --> 01:37.709
I just wanted to ask
you about breakfast.

01:37.709 --> 01:39.584
I'm thinking we'll
leave at 8:00,

01:39.584 --> 01:42.250
and I'd really like to sail,
if we can, on the way back.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.792
I'm just thinking, what are
we gonna do for breakfast?

01:43.792 --> 01:46.334
We can do stuff in their hands,
breakfast sandwiches.

01:46.334 --> 01:47.959
-Like English muffins.
-Yeah.

01:47.959 --> 01:56.167
All right, thanks.

01:56.167 --> 01:57.959
I can't wait to
see what he's gonna cook.

01:57.959 --> 01:59.250
What can I get
you guys to drink?

01:59.250 --> 02:00.626
Two dirty vodka martinis.

02:00.626 --> 02:02.292
I don't know why Colin's hungry,

02:02.292 --> 02:04.459
he just sits in
the engine room all day.

02:04.459 --> 02:05.542
Gotta look busy.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.834
-What's up, y'all?
-Let's do a vodka tonic.

02:07.834 --> 02:09.167
Vodka tonic? Sure.

02:09.167 --> 02:12.292
Marcos, Marcos, all the
guests are up, FYI.

02:12.292 --> 02:14.167
Ashley, master's free.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.959
So, we're leaving
8:30 tomorrow morning.

02:16.959 --> 02:18.959
It's gonna be a
little bit rolly.

02:18.959 --> 02:20.626
We're gonna get sails up,
so we're just thinking

02:20.626 --> 02:22.959
about what's the best way
to do breakfast.

02:22.959 --> 02:26.959
Daisy and Marcos have
suggested maybe wraps and...

02:26.959 --> 02:29.584
Yeah, yeah.

02:29.584 --> 02:30.417
Cool.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.834
Breakfast burritos,
that's amazing.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.042
That'd be great.

02:33.042 --> 02:34.042
How are you feeling
about dinner?

02:34.042 --> 02:35.501
We're ready.

02:35.501 --> 02:37.167
Okay, great, well,
whenever you're ready,

02:37.167 --> 02:39.417
if you take a seat,
and I will let Marcos know.

02:39.417 --> 02:40.125
Hola.

02:40.125 --> 02:41.417
What have you done to your hair?

02:41.417 --> 02:42.375
I brushed it.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.417
Oh, I was just gonna say,
it looks nice.

02:44.417 --> 02:45.459
Well, thanks.

02:45.459 --> 02:47.584
I'd like to have
a Sapporo beer.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.417
Daisy, do we have
any Sapporo beer?

02:49.417 --> 02:51.375
I don't think we have
any Japanese beer.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.167
-Oh, come on.
-I can check for you.

02:53.167 --> 02:54.834
Is this what we're drinking,
the sake and this here?

02:54.834 --> 02:56.209
-This one's the sake.
-Oh.

02:56.209 --> 02:58.083
-This one, yeah.
-I need a sake cup.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.542
Ashley, Ashley, Daisy.

02:59.542 --> 03:01.501
-Go ahead.
-Can you come up for service?

03:01.501 --> 03:02.584
I need a second.

03:02.584 --> 03:03.417
On my way.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.959
I'm steaming up, baby,
cool me off.

03:04.959 --> 03:06.375
You can go.

03:06.375 --> 03:07.584
Are you gonna come up
and say what it is?

03:07.584 --> 03:09.042
-Yeah, bring it up.
-Yeah? Okay.

03:09.042 --> 03:10.042
They're gonna start
eating anyway.

03:10.042 --> 03:11.375
You need help with that?

03:11.375 --> 03:12.375
That would be amazing,
Colin, thank you.

03:12.375 --> 03:15.792
They're gonna be stoked.

03:15.792 --> 03:19.459
You've got...
where's my chef, por favor?

03:19.459 --> 03:21.792
Tell him I miss him,
I wanna see him right now.

03:21.792 --> 03:22.959
They wanna see you, Marcos.

03:22.959 --> 03:24.667
-Where's my chef?
-"My chef?"

03:24.667 --> 03:26.626
She hired me for
a few days, that's it.

03:26.626 --> 03:29.876
-Wow.
-There's more? Jeez.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.709
Dude, look at this.

03:32.709 --> 03:34.626
Hey! Woo!

03:34.626 --> 03:36.375
I said, we haven't
seen you all day.

03:36.375 --> 03:39.209
They're like, because he's,
like, preparing all day.

03:39.209 --> 03:40.501
Now, hold on, hold on,
can I have...

03:40.501 --> 03:41.959
-Yeah.
-...what do we got here, Chef?

03:41.959 --> 03:44.167
Tuna tataki, a crab
roll with avocado

03:44.167 --> 03:46.792
and cream cheese,
salmon roll with caviar,

03:46.792 --> 03:50.792
spicy tuna roll with
jalapeno and truffle oil, yeah.

03:50.792 --> 03:52.000
Oh, my God, that's my favorite.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.667
-Bon appÃ©tito, hey!
-Thank you.

03:55.667 --> 03:56.918
Bravo.

03:56.918 --> 03:58.542
Whew, thank God.

03:58.542 --> 03:59.834
Let her serve, honey, it's hot.

03:59.834 --> 04:01.334
You can't really do that.

04:01.334 --> 04:03.083
When she gets a chance,
she'll serve it.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.083
Yeah, sure, what would you like?

04:05.083 --> 04:06.501
I'll have one of those,
and tuna sashimi.

04:06.501 --> 04:07.501
Sure.

04:07.501 --> 04:10.459
I ----ing wanna rip
this guy's head off,

04:10.459 --> 04:15.083
but I will be sweet,
professional chief stew Daisy.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.584
Would you like anything else?

04:16.584 --> 04:18.792
I don't know,
it was a Menorca beer.

04:18.792 --> 04:19.959
It was good. Menorca.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.584
It was a Menorca beer,
a Menorca beer.

04:21.584 --> 04:23.334
All right, they're happy,
they're ----ing like...

04:23.334 --> 04:25.292
Ashley, you got a Japanese beer?

04:25.292 --> 04:26.792
We'll take six Sapporos.

04:26.792 --> 04:31.792
I don't know if I have Sapporo.
Let me see what I have.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.167
-Yeah.
-Just ignore him.

04:33.167 --> 04:34.501
That's what you do
with three-year-olds,

04:34.501 --> 04:35.667
just ignore him.

04:35.667 --> 04:38.125
That's all we need to eat
for the rest of our life.

04:38.125 --> 04:40.209
Gary, can you check
their preference sheet

04:40.209 --> 04:43.042
and see if Japanese beer
was requested?

04:43.042 --> 04:44.542
You like that, huh?

04:44.542 --> 04:46.959
You would be so skinny,
sweetie, skinny, skinny, skinny.

04:46.959 --> 04:48.250
What do you mean, "I would be?"

04:48.250 --> 04:51.167
Check Japanese beer
was requested.

04:51.167 --> 04:54.792
Taste this, babe, right now.

04:54.792 --> 04:55.792
No, none of them.

04:55.792 --> 04:56.792
Thank you.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.334
What?

04:58.334 --> 05:02.375
I'm going to ----ing punch
that ----ing mother----er.

05:02.375 --> 05:04.834
[bleep]

05:04.834 --> 05:06.959
Woo, how sexy is she
when she's angry?

05:06.959 --> 05:09.375
Just to let you know,
I checked the preference sheet,

05:09.375 --> 05:11.584
and there was no Japanese beer,
so we didn't order any in.

05:11.584 --> 05:14.501
We didn't know we were gonna get
a spread like this.

05:14.501 --> 05:15.334
Oh, okay.

05:15.334 --> 05:18.417
Tomorrow, easy
breakfast, burritos.

05:18.417 --> 05:19.459
Yeah.

05:19.459 --> 05:21.959
I hate to say it, but I'm full.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.375
This guy?

05:23.375 --> 05:27.584
Yeah.

05:27.584 --> 05:28.584
What a dinner, guys.

05:28.584 --> 05:33.250
-The jalapeno was spicy.
-Oh, oh, it's hot.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.000
God!

05:34.000 --> 05:38.959
Ashley, go to bed.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.292
Are you guys all good here?

05:40.292 --> 05:41.125
Yeah.

05:41.125 --> 05:43.000
Okay, good night, y'all.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.751
Oh, my God, I feel
so good right now.

05:44.751 --> 05:46.042
Are you guys off to bed?

05:46.042 --> 05:47.626
We wanna try to wake up early.

05:47.626 --> 05:50.667
We would like a thing of ice,
a thing of vodka, and,

05:50.667 --> 05:53.667
like, a couple tonics, couple
of sodas, thank you so much.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.083
I will bring it down to
you now, you're welcome.

05:55.083 --> 05:56.083
Thank you so much.

05:56.083 --> 06:00.501
Good night.

06:00.501 --> 06:02.542
Yes.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.167
Tuck me in.

06:04.167 --> 06:05.667
They want these for bedtime?

06:05.667 --> 06:07.167
I don't get it.

06:07.167 --> 06:12.042
-They wanna party in their room.
-Okay.

06:12.042 --> 06:13.584
[knocking]

06:13.584 --> 06:17.501
-Thank you, sweetie.
-Hi, you're welcome.

06:17.501 --> 06:20.209
Good night, asshole, see you
in the ----ing morning.

06:20.209 --> 06:21.501
Sleep well, guys.

06:21.501 --> 06:31.042
Have fun.
You're welcome.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.959
Okay. I'm gonna go rinse down.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.501
Okay, thank you,
thanks for your help.

06:34.501 --> 06:48.501
No problem, night.

06:48.501 --> 06:53.876
Oh, man, oh, man,
oh, man, so much boat.

06:53.876 --> 06:55.167
Good morning.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.375
-How you doing?
-All good.

06:56.375 --> 07:00.834
I'm gonna go to bed.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.334
Is any guests up?

07:02.334 --> 07:04.501
No, they might get up once
we get going, though.

07:04.501 --> 07:07.083
Yeah, they'll do, they're gonna
----ing get rolled out of bed.

07:07.083 --> 07:16.667
-Yeah.
-No doubt.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.334
How was the boat
looking this morning?

07:18.334 --> 07:19.834
-Yeah, it was good.
-Fine.

07:19.834 --> 07:21.667
So, I've done the fly bridge...

07:21.667 --> 07:23.000
Yeah, that's fine....

07:23.000 --> 07:24.417
...the cockpit, I put
those fenders away.

07:24.417 --> 07:25.751
Oh, you put them away?
Really?

07:25.751 --> 07:27.334
Yeah, I just thought
they're gonna

07:27.334 --> 07:28.751
get blown around and
salty and horrible.

07:28.751 --> 07:30.042
Yeah, exactly.

07:30.042 --> 07:31.709
I could work a hell
of a lot harder and make

07:31.709 --> 07:33.792
that boat a hell of a lot nicer,
but I'm here to have fun.

07:33.792 --> 07:36.626
I mean, work smart, not hard.

07:36.626 --> 07:38.626
So, I'm thinking if I can
get along with Gary,

07:38.626 --> 07:40.209
I'm not gonna have
to worry about

07:40.209 --> 07:42.584
cleaning the windows
too much.

07:42.584 --> 07:47.417
This is all that
we've got left, eh?

07:47.417 --> 07:48.250
Perfect.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.167
Gary and Colin,
I'm gonna fire up

07:50.167 --> 07:51.167
and start picking up right now.

07:51.167 --> 07:54.709
Copy from deck crew.

07:54.709 --> 07:55.626
So, if it gets too tight

07:55.626 --> 07:57.250
and we're pulling
against each other,

07:57.250 --> 07:59.375
then you're gonna have
to ease.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.375
Three o'clock, medium stay.

08:01.375 --> 08:03.626
Okay, Glenn, both anchors
are home, both anchors are home.

08:03.626 --> 08:06.417
Copy, thanks, mate.

08:06.417 --> 08:08.417
-Good morning.
-Morning, morning.

08:08.417 --> 08:10.334
-Oh, wow.
-Oh, look at this, eh?

08:10.334 --> 08:12.125
Wow, what's going on?
New deckhand, eh?

08:12.125 --> 08:13.167
I got the memo.

08:13.167 --> 08:14.667
-Should we get sails up?
-Mm-hmm.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.667
All crew, all crew,
we're gonna be sailing

08:16.667 --> 08:17.417
in about five minutes.

08:17.417 --> 08:18.876
We're gonna do the mizzen now.

08:18.876 --> 08:20.167
Okay, going up.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.167
Might be a bit rolly.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.918
I'm gonna wrap them on a foil.

08:23.918 --> 08:27.125
Okay, that's good,
let's go to the main.

08:27.125 --> 08:28.667
Okay, hold.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.167
We'll go a little fat till
we get the genoa out.

08:30.167 --> 08:32.584
Keep coming up.

08:32.584 --> 08:38.751
-Engine's off. Sailing, baby.
-This is it, right?

08:38.751 --> 08:41.125
Ooh, fire, fire. All right.

08:41.125 --> 08:44.125
-Morning, guys.
-Morning.

08:44.125 --> 08:45.792
Just hold on!

08:45.792 --> 08:47.375
Got a nice tilt now.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.042
This is probably in the teens.

08:49.042 --> 08:53.417
[vomiting]

08:53.417 --> 08:54.792
-Morning.
-Morning, how are you?

08:54.792 --> 09:02.626
I don't know yet.

09:02.626 --> 09:07.000
Up on the top.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.167
Which they definitely are.

09:08.167 --> 09:09.459
Sit over there.

09:09.459 --> 09:13.459
I gotta lay down,
I gotta lay down.

09:13.459 --> 09:14.501
Ugh!

09:14.501 --> 09:16.334
Baby, it's actually beautiful.

09:16.334 --> 09:17.959
You gotta sit up though,
like this.

09:17.959 --> 09:24.792
[laughs]

09:24.792 --> 09:26.626
Got a nice tilt now.

09:26.626 --> 09:27.626
I gotta lay down,
I gotta lay down.

09:27.626 --> 09:29.000
All right, go over there.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.501
It's not really that
bad out here, is it?

09:30.501 --> 09:32.375
No, this is fine.

09:32.375 --> 09:34.292
Good morning.

09:34.292 --> 09:35.959
Anything for you, Dr. Nichols?

09:35.959 --> 09:37.209
Are you okay... no? Okay.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.501
Can I get you anything, Chris?

09:39.501 --> 09:41.918
How do you like it?

09:41.918 --> 09:42.584
I can do that.

09:42.584 --> 09:44.083
I think I can have a mimosa.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.083
-Mimosa for this guy.
-Mimosa?

09:45.083 --> 09:46.626
Can I have a vodka orange juice?

09:46.626 --> 09:48.292
Yeah, and I think
we're doing food, right,

09:48.292 --> 09:49.959
in five minutes or so?

09:49.959 --> 09:51.000
Thank you.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.626
Shoot me.

09:52.626 --> 09:59.959
Oh, Daisy Dukes, just in time
for the drinks to start coming.

09:59.959 --> 10:03.876
-Hey, Captain.
-Yes?

10:03.876 --> 10:05.876
That's it, honey, you're going
home by yourself.

10:05.876 --> 10:08.000
Oh!

10:08.000 --> 10:09.375
Ow!

10:09.375 --> 10:10.918
Barnabus, if you could...
if you have...

10:10.918 --> 10:12.209
-"Barnabus" isn't sticking.
-Bar...

10:12.209 --> 10:13.375
Holy moly.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.209
Barnabus, you can
do it yourself.

10:15.209 --> 10:17.584
Barnaby.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.083
She ----ing hates sailing.

10:19.083 --> 10:22.000
Hey, I got a great idea,
let's go on a sailing trip.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.542
She ----ing hates boats.

10:23.542 --> 10:25.709
-What do you got there?
-We got breakfast burritos...

10:25.709 --> 10:27.209
-Okay.
-...and breakfast McMuffins.

10:27.209 --> 10:29.292
I'll have a sausage McMuffin.

10:29.292 --> 10:30.626
-Good morning.
-Hi.

10:30.626 --> 10:34.834
-You just wake up, Daisy?
-I did.

10:34.834 --> 10:35.584
Get in there.

10:35.584 --> 10:37.042
Okay, going away
on the genoa.

10:37.042 --> 10:38.626
Copy.

10:38.626 --> 10:40.584
As soon as that's done,
let's get them back up here.

10:40.584 --> 10:41.792
You can watch the mizzen,
you can watch the main,

10:41.792 --> 10:43.667
we'll put these sails away.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.959
I'm gonna make the master
and dry the shower.

10:45.959 --> 10:47.167
Coming down.

10:47.167 --> 10:48.292
So, how's the sausage,
egg, and cheese?

10:48.292 --> 10:49.667
Excellent.

10:49.667 --> 10:51.000
That is the most
delicious little salsa thingie

10:51.000 --> 10:52.417
that they gave us there.

10:52.417 --> 10:54.292
-Back a little bit.
-Back a little bit.

10:54.292 --> 10:58.250
Okay. Stop there.

10:58.250 --> 11:02.375
Oh, Lord, I don't even know.

11:02.375 --> 11:06.292
-So...
-Yes.

11:06.292 --> 11:07.334
Okay.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.375
Mine are ready to go.

11:08.375 --> 11:09.417
Okay, great, thank you, Donna.

11:09.417 --> 11:10.834
[bleep] there's sh-- everywhere.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.250
Dirt on the carpet.

11:12.250 --> 11:14.417
I had this, like,
bronzer cream,

11:14.417 --> 11:15.751
you know, flew off the thing.

11:15.751 --> 11:20.501
There's bronzer all
over the wall.

11:20.501 --> 11:27.918
Oh, my God, this is
just ----ed.

11:27.918 --> 11:30.083
No, I'm not going to.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.459
I don't care.

11:31.459 --> 11:34.250
I think this is maybe just OJ.

11:34.250 --> 11:44.584
They shut me off.

11:44.584 --> 11:45.751
Daisy!

11:45.751 --> 11:48.000
Now you've got me looking
over my shoulder, scared.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.167
Stop, you're making me nervous.

11:51.167 --> 11:53.334
These bags need to go up now.

11:53.334 --> 11:55.834
Yeah, I know.

11:55.834 --> 11:57.083
Hey, Daisy?

11:57.083 --> 11:58.083
Shh!

11:58.083 --> 12:01.209
Is anybody there?

12:01.209 --> 12:06.250
[radio chatter]

12:06.250 --> 12:07.334
What would you like?

12:07.334 --> 12:08.792
Vodka orange juice, please.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.250
Yeah, sure.

12:10.250 --> 12:13.083
Jesus.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.083
You know how to do these, right?

12:14.083 --> 12:15.459
Nope.

12:15.459 --> 12:16.834
That's a monkey's fist
on the end.

12:16.834 --> 12:18.959
Helps get our line to
shore when we fire away.

12:18.959 --> 12:20.417
Yeah.

12:20.417 --> 12:21.751
I've never docked a boat
as big as this,

12:21.751 --> 12:23.918
so we never have to
use those heaving lines

12:23.918 --> 12:24.834
to throw the big line.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.834
We can just throw
the normal line anyway.

12:26.834 --> 12:30.542
The key is to not let it
make a knot in there.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.584
When it's windy, it must
be tough to do this, huh?

12:32.584 --> 12:34.501
-This is not too bad.
-A meter aft, Glenn.

12:34.501 --> 12:38.167
All right, let's get the
bow line on.

12:38.167 --> 12:41.918
-Good throw!
-Thank goodness.

12:41.918 --> 12:43.542
Is that forward-going
spring on?

12:43.542 --> 12:46.918
Okay, forward
running spring's on.

12:46.918 --> 12:48.792
Not bad, Glenn, not bad.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.042
Thank you.

12:50.042 --> 12:51.584
Nice, that looks good, thanks.

12:51.584 --> 12:53.792
-I'm gonna go down.
-Good job, bro.

12:53.792 --> 12:55.375
Cheers, mate, thank
you for helping out.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.375
Nice one.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.501
[knocking]

12:57.501 --> 12:58.584
Hey, girls?

12:58.584 --> 12:59.584
-Yeah?
-Hey, what's up?

12:59.584 --> 13:00.834
The guests are about to leave.

13:00.834 --> 13:02.000
Should we go down?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.167
This is a nice spot right here.

13:03.167 --> 13:06.709
Let's get everybody on the dock.

13:06.709 --> 13:11.876
Let's go first, honey, come on.

13:11.876 --> 13:13.417
Well done.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.501
Thank you so much.

13:15.501 --> 13:17.209
Kelsie, Mr. New Zealand.

13:17.209 --> 13:18.834
Cheers, man.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.959
You were the best. Wait a
second... I can't kiss you.

13:20.959 --> 13:23.167
Oh [bleep] off.

13:23.167 --> 13:25.417
Oh, my chef!

13:25.417 --> 13:27.876
-Hope to see you guys again.
-Yes.

13:27.876 --> 13:29.709
-Hug, thanks for everything.
-Thank you so much.

13:29.709 --> 13:32.375
We just wanna say thank you
from the bottom of our hearts.

13:32.375 --> 13:34.918
You guys were amazing,
the food was absolutely...

13:34.918 --> 13:36.709
-Thank you, thank you so much.
-...absolutely amazing.

13:36.709 --> 13:38.834
We were just astounded, so thank
you so much, from all of us.

13:38.834 --> 13:40.209
-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you very, very much.

13:40.209 --> 13:41.792
Thank you, well deserved
for all of you.

13:41.792 --> 13:42.959
Oh, thank
you, thank you very much.

13:42.959 --> 13:44.250
Thank you!

13:44.250 --> 13:46.459
-Bye.
-Cheers, guys.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.375
Amazing. Bye, guys.

13:48.375 --> 13:51.626
-[ship horn sounds]
-Woo, bye-bye!

13:51.626 --> 13:54.542
I probably ruined my whole
career in yachting for that.

13:54.542 --> 14:02.918
Okay, deck team,
let's go get changed.

14:02.918 --> 14:04.959
I do like mud.

14:04.959 --> 14:06.501
You do like mud,
but you don't like Gary.

14:06.501 --> 14:07.834
I like the taste of dirt.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.918
Just not Gary rubbing
you down with it.

14:09.918 --> 14:12.918
-Ugh.
-Ugh!

14:12.918 --> 14:14.792
All crew, all crew,
can we get everybody

14:14.792 --> 14:18.918
in the saloon for
a tip meeting, thank you.

14:18.918 --> 14:20.584
Oh...

14:20.584 --> 14:22.584
Okay. Here we are again.

14:22.584 --> 14:27.250
I just wanna say major kudos to
all of you, especially to Daisy.

14:27.250 --> 14:30.083
We all know losing
Gabriela was not easy.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.417
That's been hard on all of us,

14:31.417 --> 14:34.751
especially with
very demanding guests.

14:34.751 --> 14:36.918
-I'm very proud of you guys.
-Thank you.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.667
That brings me to Barnaby.

14:38.667 --> 14:41.167
You did a great job, we're
really happy to have you here.

14:41.167 --> 14:42.709
Cool, yeah, thank you, everyone.

14:42.709 --> 14:44.375
Obviously, I don't know
what I'm doing, so...

14:44.375 --> 14:46.375
No, you're doing a
really good job.

14:46.375 --> 14:47.542
Thank you. Cool.

14:47.542 --> 14:48.959
That's fake it till you make it.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.751
Well, all in all,
I think it went really well.

14:50.751 --> 14:53.959
They were challenging, but
I think they left very happy,

14:53.959 --> 14:56.959
and I think that is
reflected in the tip.

14:56.959 --> 15:00.501
The tip is 20,000 U.S.

15:00.501 --> 15:04.792
So, that comes to, like
the last one, 2,500 each.

15:04.792 --> 15:05.626
Yes.

15:05.626 --> 15:07.459
Yeah, 2,100
and change, well done.

15:07.459 --> 15:11.000
I have absolutely no guilt.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.876
We ----ing deserved it.

15:12.876 --> 15:15.667
Lastly, we're lucky to have
a new addition to our team

15:15.667 --> 15:18.417
who will be joining
us this afternoon.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.792
-Ooh!
-Oh, that's sweet.

15:20.792 --> 15:22.459
Let's get ready to welcome
her with open arms.

15:22.459 --> 15:24.125
Yeah, I'm good
to continue this way.

15:24.125 --> 15:25.918
-Should I cancel her?
-No!

15:25.918 --> 15:27.042
Yes, yes!

15:27.042 --> 15:29.959
Daisy and I are working so
well together at this point,

15:29.959 --> 15:32.167
the last thing I want
is some new girl

15:32.167 --> 15:34.501
showing up and
bossing me around.

15:34.501 --> 15:38.584
I prefer twosomes.
I don't like to share.

15:38.584 --> 15:40.417
And then you guys
are gonna go

15:40.417 --> 15:42.626
and have a nice meal tonight,
a nice dinner.

15:42.626 --> 15:44.501
All right, guys,
thank you very much.

15:44.501 --> 15:45.667
-And on that note.
-On that note.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.125
Thanks, everybody.
-Thank you.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.125
She's coming today?

15:48.125 --> 15:49.375
Is she gonna work today?

15:49.375 --> 15:53.125
Nope, I think she's
just going out.

15:53.125 --> 15:55.501
It's, like, weird having
her come in on a night off.

15:55.501 --> 15:57.417
Like, new guys are easy for me,

15:57.417 --> 15:59.667
obviously, but new girls
are a little bit...

15:59.667 --> 16:03.501
I'm a little nervous.

16:03.501 --> 16:04.792
You're gonna be fine.

16:04.792 --> 16:11.042
Little nervous,
I'm not gonna lie.

16:11.042 --> 16:12.626
Hello?

16:12.626 --> 16:14.167
-Coming up.
-Have you shagged Ashley?

16:14.167 --> 16:15.584
No, I did not.

16:15.584 --> 16:17.959
If someone wants to deny
the fact that anything happened,

16:17.959 --> 16:17.959
I remember the ----ing
penis in my vagina.

16:17.959 --> 16:26.792
Got a nice tilt now.

16:26.792 --> 16:28.209
-Hello?
-Hello.

16:28.209 --> 16:29.584
I'm Scarlett.

16:29.584 --> 16:30.959
Scarlett, hi, I'm Glenn,
nice to meet you.

16:30.959 --> 16:31.792
Nice to meet you.

16:31.792 --> 16:33.626
Welcome aboard,
where are you from?

16:33.626 --> 16:34.918
I'm originally from Arkansas,
small town.

16:34.918 --> 16:36.125
Okay.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.584
But I've been in
San Diego for three years.

16:37.584 --> 16:38.626
Yeah, how do you like
it over there?

16:38.626 --> 16:39.876
-I love it.
-Okay.

16:39.876 --> 16:41.083
-It's on the water, so...
-Cool.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.250
...my happy place.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.542
I'm from Arkansas, but
I don't like country music,

16:44.542 --> 16:45.876
I'm very out there.

16:45.876 --> 16:47.792
And I'm rebellious,

16:47.792 --> 16:50.125
I will touch the hot stove
and see for myself.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.792
Well, let me introduce
you to the crew.

16:51.792 --> 16:52.834
Perfect.

16:52.834 --> 16:54.417
The first guy I dated when
I moved to San Diego

16:54.417 --> 16:55.751
was actually a boat captain.

16:55.751 --> 16:58.250
We went out on the
water the same day,

16:58.250 --> 16:59.334
and then it just became my life.

16:59.334 --> 17:00.959
It's just, like, weird.

17:00.959 --> 17:02.667
Let's see if we
can find these guys.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.417
-Gary? Colin?
-Yo?

17:04.417 --> 17:05.501
This is Scarlett.

17:05.501 --> 17:06.959
-Hi.
-Hey, nice to meet you.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.167
-Scarlett, nice to meet you.
-How's it going?

17:08.167 --> 17:09.959
-Good, how are you?
- Good. Hello.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.501
-Hi.
-I'm Barnaby.

17:11.501 --> 17:13.000
-Nice to meet you. Scarlett.
-Nice to meet you, Scarlett.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.209
-Sorry, let me...
-No, you're fine.

17:14.209 --> 17:15.584
...squeeze past.

17:15.584 --> 17:17.209
-Hi, Ashley.
-Ashley, I'm Scarlett.

17:17.209 --> 17:19.167
Nice to meet you.
You're my roommate.

17:19.167 --> 17:22.167
Oh, yay!

17:22.167 --> 17:23.375
Scarlett!

17:23.375 --> 17:25.542
Yeah, the floor is stainless.

17:25.542 --> 17:26.959
-The floor too?
-Yeah.

17:26.959 --> 17:28.000
Okay.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.375
Scarlett, there's some
more gentlemen in here.

17:30.375 --> 17:31.459
Hello, I'm Scarlett.

17:31.459 --> 17:32.792
-Hello.
-That's Gary.

17:32.792 --> 17:34.083
-Hey, Scarlett, Gary.
-Nice to meet you.

17:34.083 --> 17:35.459
Marcos. You already met
Colin and Barnaby.

17:35.459 --> 17:37.125
-What was your name?
-Marcos.

17:37.125 --> 17:38.792
-Marcos, nice to meet you.
-Daisy, she's the chief stew.

17:38.792 --> 17:40.834
Do you need a hand with
anything, your luggage or stuff?

17:40.834 --> 17:42.292
I don't know, you wanna
check on that?

17:42.292 --> 17:43.459
Oh, of course.

17:43.459 --> 17:45.626
Because I didn't
see any luggage.

17:45.626 --> 17:47.292
Out of my way!

17:47.292 --> 17:48.375
Oh, my God, you boys.

17:48.375 --> 17:49.792
-I'm Daisy.
-Scarlett.

17:49.792 --> 17:50.959
-Scarlett, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

17:50.959 --> 17:52.959
Am I taking it straight
to my cabin?

17:52.959 --> 17:54.375
No, I'm just kidding.

17:54.375 --> 17:58.000
-I'm Kelsie.
-Scarlett. Nice to meet you.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.792
Oh, mother----er,
what does she have in here?

18:00.792 --> 18:02.751
-Have you met all the crew?
-I believe so.

18:02.751 --> 18:03.918
Okay, cool.

18:03.918 --> 18:05.167
-Is there a charter tomorrow?
-No.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.042
Oh.

18:06.042 --> 18:08.125
Tomorrow's just
turning around the boat.

18:08.125 --> 18:10.167
Is there a dead body
in here or something?

18:10.167 --> 18:11.542
Yeah.

18:11.542 --> 18:12.834
Have you done boats before?

18:12.834 --> 18:14.292
Nothing to this extent.

18:14.292 --> 18:15.584
Obviously ask me anything
you want, but yeah...

18:15.584 --> 18:17.167
Okay.

18:17.167 --> 18:18.709
...it's just gonna be really
steep learning curve.

18:18.709 --> 18:21.167
-I'm hoping to pick it up fast.
-You will.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.834
As long as Scarlett doesn't
piss me off, she'll be fine.

18:23.834 --> 18:25.584
-Do you need toiletries?
-Where did you come from?

18:25.584 --> 18:26.959
-You come from the States?
-Scarlett...

18:26.959 --> 18:27.959
-I'm from San Diego.
-...if you need...

18:27.959 --> 18:29.334
So, you flew in from there now?

18:29.334 --> 18:30.918
Shh, Gary, you can talk
to her in two seconds.

18:30.918 --> 18:32.751
If you need toiletries,
they're in there.

18:32.751 --> 18:34.542
Okay, got it.

18:34.542 --> 18:36.417
We'll see.

18:36.417 --> 18:38.167
Now you may talk to her.

18:38.167 --> 18:41.375
No, no, that's me done, that's
all I wanted to find out.

18:41.375 --> 18:42.542
Boring!

18:42.542 --> 18:43.959
How old are you?

18:43.959 --> 18:46.918
-I'm 25. How old are you?
-Twenty-three.

18:46.918 --> 18:47.792
Oh, nice.

18:47.792 --> 18:49.125
Did you finish, Ashley?

18:49.125 --> 18:50.292
Yeah, I didn't finish
everything.

18:50.292 --> 18:52.000
No, that's fine.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.209
I don't think I even asked
you... what position are you?

18:53.209 --> 19:00.876
-Third stew.
-Cool.

19:00.876 --> 19:03.959
A large catamaran in San Diego,
and then I was,

19:03.959 --> 19:09.459
like, raised, you know,
on boats and stuff a lot.

19:09.459 --> 19:21.584
Yeah. Are you?

19:21.584 --> 19:25.542
Okay.

19:25.542 --> 19:26.918
Thank you.

19:26.918 --> 19:33.542
[Colin sings]

19:33.542 --> 19:35.042
-I'm gonna sit outside.
-Yep.

19:35.042 --> 19:37.501
-You look lovely, Dais.
-Thank you.

19:37.501 --> 19:39.751
Oh, it's so cool.

19:39.751 --> 19:41.959
-Cheers, ladies.
-Cheers.

19:41.959 --> 19:42.959
Well done.

19:42.959 --> 19:45.459
-I'm so excited to be here.
-Yeah? Yeah?

19:45.459 --> 19:48.459
-Vamos.
-Girl, get in the back with me.

19:48.459 --> 19:50.792
Cheers, girls. Cheers!

19:50.792 --> 19:52.250
Look at this dress.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.792
Oh, thanks, Barnaby.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.292
Yeah, that dress is
hideous, take it off.

19:55.292 --> 19:58.292
Oh, dear, here we go.

19:58.292 --> 19:59.959
Your totally gonna
[bleep] the new girl.

19:59.959 --> 20:01.584
-No, I'm not.
-You totally are.

20:01.584 --> 20:03.292
-Are you the new girl?
-You shagged Ashley.

20:03.292 --> 20:05.417
-No, I did not.
-Yes, you did.

20:05.417 --> 20:06.959
-No, I did not.
-Own it.

20:06.959 --> 20:08.667
Somebody needs to
remember tonight.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.209
-One for Barnaby.
-It's gonna be Marcos.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.125
Marcos knows all,
Marcos knows things

20:12.125 --> 20:15.042
that I don't know,
apparently, now.

20:15.042 --> 20:17.959
-Did I?
-No way.

20:17.959 --> 20:20.667
Okay, no.

20:20.667 --> 20:22.167
He dipped it in and out,
and that's that.

20:22.167 --> 20:23.584
Okay.

20:23.584 --> 20:25.167
Well, that's like if you
take an ice cream

20:25.167 --> 20:26.751
and you lick it, did
you eat the ice cream?

20:26.751 --> 20:29.250
-No, you just...
-Yes, the calories still count.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.751
[laughing]

20:31.751 --> 20:33.792
-The front?
-Yeah. Oh!

20:33.792 --> 20:37.250
Oh, my God, pretty!

20:37.250 --> 20:49.834
This is us, guys.

20:49.834 --> 20:53.125
Whether you wanna acknowledge
it or not, it happened.

20:53.125 --> 20:55.292
It's like he's ashamed of me

20:55.292 --> 20:56.626
I wanna be closest to the water.

20:56.626 --> 20:59.083
This is quite
something, guys.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.042
Oh, this is so cute.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.125
Welcome to our
restaurant terrace.

21:03.125 --> 21:05.083
We've prepared
some tapas for you,

21:05.083 --> 21:07.459
some sharing platters
using local produce.

21:07.459 --> 21:08.459
We will bring them out.

21:08.459 --> 21:09.709
Can I get you any more drinks?

21:09.709 --> 21:11.125
-Thank you.
-Yes.

21:11.125 --> 21:11.834
-Yes, please.

21:11.834 --> 21:13.167
Do you have an espresso martini?

21:13.167 --> 21:14.959
-Could we get eight tequilas?
-Okay.

21:14.959 --> 21:20.000
-Cheers, thanks, guys.
-I'm gonna get ----ed up.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.918
Nothing like this.

21:20.918 --> 21:23.292
It's more of, like,
day charters.

21:23.292 --> 21:24.417
This is huge.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.542
[bleep] that thing is massive.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.083
Wait, I'm having
tequila as well.

21:28.083 --> 21:31.042
-Okay, cheers, guys.
-Cheers to the newbies.

21:31.042 --> 21:33.417
Yay, newbies!

21:33.417 --> 21:38.250
[chattering]

21:38.250 --> 21:39.751
Vodka water.

21:39.751 --> 21:40.959
Vodka water, that's an
interesting choice.

21:40.959 --> 21:43.584
-Have you had it?
-No. I will now.

21:43.584 --> 21:49.792
Refreshing.

21:49.792 --> 21:51.334
-Yeah?
-It's pretty good.

21:51.334 --> 21:54.000
Gary, Gary, Gary...

21:54.000 --> 21:56.584
Is there anything in here?
I don't know about that.

21:56.584 --> 21:59.918
Gary. Gary.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.292
I don't know, they're random.

22:01.292 --> 22:02.876
Oh, are they?

22:02.876 --> 22:05.459
Y'all are gonna see the really
not good side of me.

22:05.459 --> 22:07.959
So, you don't eat seafood,
that's all you don't eat?

22:07.959 --> 22:09.125
Mm-hmm.

22:09.125 --> 22:11.125
Yeah?

22:11.125 --> 22:12.417
Shrimp, I'll eat shrimp.

22:12.417 --> 22:15.959
You can deny it happened,
but it happened.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.792
I remember more than he says.

22:18.792 --> 22:21.626
Try one of these bad boys.

22:21.626 --> 22:22.792
-Yeah.
-Not that bad?

22:22.792 --> 22:24.792
-It's so good.
-Bleh, bleh.

22:24.792 --> 22:31.000
You'll like it, it's like--

22:31.000 --> 22:32.334
We're good.

22:32.334 --> 22:33.792
Okay.

22:33.792 --> 22:35.250
Gary, can we go for a cigarette?

22:35.250 --> 22:36.918
-I'll go with you, Daisy.
-No, you will not.

22:36.918 --> 22:42.751
Yes, thank you, Scarlett.

22:42.751 --> 22:43.959
I know that's what happened.

22:43.959 --> 22:45.584
We'll figure it
out in the morning.

22:45.584 --> 22:47.959
I'm just, like,
honestly so happy to be here.

22:47.959 --> 22:48.959
Good!

22:48.959 --> 22:50.751
I think we're gonna
have fun, and, like...

22:50.751 --> 22:51.876
-Yeah.
-...I think we'll kill it.

22:51.876 --> 22:53.792
-Are you single?
-I am single.

22:53.792 --> 22:56.709
Oh, God. Here comes trouble.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.584
I've heard.

22:58.584 --> 22:59.959
Watch out for Gary.

22:59.959 --> 23:04.584
Yeah, I know, I can
already, like, feel it.

23:04.584 --> 23:06.292
Yeah.

23:06.292 --> 23:10.209
Yeah.
Ah!

23:10.209 --> 23:12.417
I feel like Daisy is
protective over Gary.

23:12.417 --> 23:14.792
I mean, I'm sure there's
a lot I don't know,

23:14.792 --> 23:16.083
but it's my first night here.

23:16.083 --> 23:20.292
So, this is wild.

23:20.292 --> 23:23.292
Fun times.

23:23.292 --> 23:25.542
If someone wants to deny the
fact that anything happened,

23:25.542 --> 23:28.334
I know that's what happened.

23:28.334 --> 23:30.167
I missed that, can you say
that one more time?

23:30.167 --> 23:33.459
I remember the ----ing penis
being in my ----ing vagina.

23:33.459 --> 23:34.792
Why are you going to deny it?

23:34.792 --> 23:36.334
This is why you don't hook up

23:36.334 --> 23:49.042
with someone that's so
clingy and just so childish.

23:49.042 --> 23:49.042
I remember the ----ing
penis in my vagina.

23:49.042 --> 23:57.250
-Hello?
-Hello.

23:57.250 --> 23:59.292
It happened.

23:59.292 --> 24:02.751
He can deny it, but I remember
the ----ing penis in my vagina.

24:02.751 --> 24:05.667
Mm, mm.

24:05.667 --> 24:07.751
Wow.

24:07.751 --> 24:09.250
[Gary speak Spanish]

24:09.250 --> 24:10.584
Thanks for coming for
a cigarette with me.

24:10.584 --> 24:11.709
Yeah, of course.

24:11.709 --> 24:13.125
That's my cue to leave.

24:13.125 --> 24:15.584
-How's it going, Daisy?
-Good.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.042
Okay, who's looking after me,

24:17.042 --> 24:18.417
I can't rely on me,
because last time

24:18.417 --> 24:20.501
you were looking after me,
I kissed Gary, so...

24:20.501 --> 24:22.959
You've kissed Gary
every ----ing night.

24:22.959 --> 24:24.792
All right, jealousy over
in the corner.

24:24.792 --> 24:25.959
Oh!

24:25.959 --> 24:35.501
Oh, she called it!

24:35.501 --> 24:36.918
That's very cute.

24:36.918 --> 24:38.959
Can I have a lighter?
Come for a cigarette.

24:38.959 --> 24:41.292
Drama, drama, drama.

24:41.292 --> 24:42.626
I feel like you're
catching on quick.

24:42.626 --> 24:43.709
Get used to it.

24:43.709 --> 24:45.042
That's just the beginning.

24:45.042 --> 24:48.042
What are you gonna do
about your girlfriend?

24:48.042 --> 24:49.167
I don't have a girlfriend...

24:49.167 --> 24:50.959
You... Ashley's your girlfriend.

24:50.959 --> 24:52.459
-No, she's not my girlfriend.
-Ashley's your new girlfriend.

24:52.459 --> 24:58.167
No, she's not.

24:58.167 --> 25:00.918
But my self-defense
mechanism's gonna come out.

25:00.918 --> 25:02.584
I'm going to bed, I'm done.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.375
-I really don't give a sh--.
-You're going to bed? Okay.

25:05.375 --> 25:08.542
I'm so sorry that
you are upset.

25:08.542 --> 25:09.709
I just wanna leave.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.542
Here they come.

25:11.542 --> 25:13.876
-Hi.
-Yay!

25:13.876 --> 25:15.000
-Vamanos, chicos.
-Vamanos!

25:15.000 --> 25:16.250
Whose wine is this?

25:16.250 --> 25:22.792
Scarlett, I'm waiting for you.

25:22.792 --> 25:23.792
Okay, girls, jump
in the front seat.

25:23.792 --> 25:25.250
Come on, let's go.

25:25.250 --> 25:31.292
-Wait, are we really?
-Yeah, well, of course you are.

25:31.292 --> 25:32.626
[laughing]

25:32.626 --> 25:34.626
You are my type of girls here.

25:34.626 --> 25:37.667
I just don't like people ----ing
lying about sh--.

25:37.667 --> 25:45.375
Ashley was hating there.

25:45.375 --> 25:46.667
Oh... sorry.

25:46.667 --> 25:49.459
Something shiny and new is here,
so he's gonna deny everything.

25:49.459 --> 25:50.792
Stop.

25:50.792 --> 25:52.083
It's one thing to, like,
just be, like,

25:52.083 --> 25:53.959
tossed off to the side,

25:53.959 --> 25:57.459
but I don't need to be, like,
kicked already while I'm down.

25:57.459 --> 25:59.542
I don't like being made
to look stupid.

25:59.542 --> 26:00.959
How do you look stupid?

26:00.959 --> 26:02.125
Because he's denying
what happened,

26:02.125 --> 26:03.959
and I remember
what happened, and...

26:03.959 --> 26:05.626
You look more stupid carrying
on about it right now

26:05.626 --> 26:10.918
like you are than the actual
----ing fact of the matter.

26:10.918 --> 26:13.626
Get me out.

26:13.626 --> 26:14.626
-You okay?
-Yep.

26:14.626 --> 26:15.709
You guys, I have to poop.

26:15.709 --> 26:17.209
That's horrible.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.083
He ----ed Ashley, no,
he didn't [bleep] Ashley,

26:19.083 --> 26:22.000
no, he did [bleep] Ashley,
no, he didn't [bleep] Ashley.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.083
I'm so confused.

26:24.083 --> 26:27.959
Nobody gives a [bleep].

26:27.959 --> 26:29.792
I'm going to the Jacuzzi.

26:29.792 --> 26:31.417
Jacuzzi, please.

26:31.417 --> 26:32.417
----ing bikini.

26:32.417 --> 26:39.667
Not now!

26:39.667 --> 26:41.417
She thinks you had sex.

26:41.417 --> 26:43.959
Yeah, if we did,
it doesn't matter.

26:43.959 --> 26:45.542
Then you can think that.

26:45.542 --> 26:47.626
Maybe it doesn't matter to you,
but it matters to her.

26:47.626 --> 26:48.959
She's not making stories up,

26:48.959 --> 26:50.959
she just remembers more
than you do,

26:50.959 --> 26:52.792
and she doesn't know
where to go from here.

26:52.792 --> 26:56.542
Gary's got his knickers in
a twist because his chances

26:56.542 --> 26:59.292
of hooking up with Scarlett
have been jeopardized.

26:59.292 --> 27:01.125
His feathers are
ruffled over it.

27:01.125 --> 27:10.167
It's obvious
what's going on here.

27:10.167 --> 27:11.792
All right, let's go all up top,

27:11.792 --> 27:13.834
and let's put
on board shorts.

27:13.834 --> 27:17.959
Ashley, Ashley, show me
your best floss now, go.

27:17.959 --> 27:20.167
We're such losers.

27:20.167 --> 27:22.334
Yay! Daisy.

27:22.334 --> 27:24.834
Guys, act professional.
Gary's here, act professional.

27:24.834 --> 27:30.792
Welcome.

27:30.792 --> 27:32.918
Let's get some bubbles in here.

27:32.918 --> 27:35.626
Bubbles in a Jacuzzi is
the most disgusting thing ever.

27:35.626 --> 27:37.751
Right in there,
right in there.

27:37.751 --> 27:47.375
Ugh!

27:47.375 --> 27:51.626
Yay!

27:51.626 --> 27:53.834
Tequila shot token of entry, go!

27:53.834 --> 27:56.792
[shouting]

27:56.792 --> 28:02.959
[chattering]

28:02.959 --> 28:11.375
Everybody behave.

28:11.375 --> 28:13.375
-Nobody cares. Nobody cares.
-No, stop it.

28:13.375 --> 28:15.626
-Nobody cares.
-It's a massage.

28:15.626 --> 28:18.667
-Nobody cares.
-I'm not mad at you.

28:18.667 --> 28:20.626
I... Gary, listen.

28:20.626 --> 28:24.959
-I'm so over it.
-Gary, I'm not mad... Gary...

28:24.959 --> 28:26.000
She's making it up
for laughs.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.209
Yeah, I know, Daisy's hilarious.

28:27.209 --> 28:28.375
Hilarious.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.709
I'm talking.
I'm... listen to me.

28:30.709 --> 28:39.209
Two seconds, Gary.

28:39.209 --> 28:43.792
I had my first solid poop
today in, like, three days.

28:43.792 --> 28:49.792
Which was good.

28:49.792 --> 28:51.876
That's why I cook so
much pasta.

28:51.876 --> 28:53.334
Your boys are hungry

28:53.334 --> 29:02.959
Because I knew you guys
gonna eat pasta tonight.

29:02.959 --> 29:05.584
Ashley, God.

29:05.584 --> 29:08.167
-Girl.
-Eww.

29:08.167 --> 29:10.042
-Look, look, look.
-Hey, don't choke.

29:10.042 --> 29:13.667
Ashley, you're eating
your feelings right now.

29:13.667 --> 29:15.167
Oh, no.

29:15.167 --> 29:16.751
Colin...

29:16.751 --> 29:19.959
Daisy, I'm not even, like...

29:19.959 --> 29:24.083
You know it's a
fork in front of you, no?

29:24.083 --> 29:25.792
Ashley, and that is
you going to bed.

29:25.792 --> 29:34.042
For [bleep] sake. Oh, my God.

29:34.042 --> 29:38.542
Good night.
Good night.

29:38.542 --> 29:40.709
-Hey, I'm gonna shower, okay?
-You're fine.

29:40.709 --> 29:42.667
Can I do anything for you?

29:42.667 --> 29:44.709
No, no, no.

29:44.709 --> 29:46.000
Gary...

29:46.000 --> 29:47.209
Come cuddle with me
here in this bed, Dais.

29:47.209 --> 29:48.167
No.

29:48.167 --> 29:50.250
Because then nothing's
gonna happen.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.751
I know if we go to the master,
then we're gonna have sex.

29:51.751 --> 29:53.042
No, I don't want
anything to happen.

29:53.042 --> 29:54.375
Exactly, then come
sleep with me here.

29:54.375 --> 29:58.501
[hiccupping]

29:58.501 --> 30:01.834
Ugh!

30:01.834 --> 30:04.375
Oh, God.

30:04.375 --> 30:04.375
Oh sh--. Ooh.

30:04.375 --> 30:16.000
It happened.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.334
Oh sh--.

30:17.334 --> 30:19.375
Eww.

30:19.375 --> 30:21.501
What the [bleep] is going on?

30:21.501 --> 30:24.334
Night one, and there's
already politics,

30:24.334 --> 30:28.250
drama, vomit in the shower.

30:28.250 --> 30:31.125
[vomits]

30:31.125 --> 30:32.584
This boat is messy.

30:32.584 --> 30:36.292
Oh, another crazy
crew night out, eh?

30:36.292 --> 30:39.792
Ugh.

30:39.792 --> 30:41.584
What was normal about it?

30:41.584 --> 30:49.000
It was normal.

30:49.000 --> 30:55.792
[alarm sounds]

30:55.792 --> 30:59.167
Yeah, how are you feeling?

30:59.167 --> 31:01.792
You over throwing up?

31:01.792 --> 31:03.125
Yeah, in the shower.

31:03.125 --> 31:04.959
Oh [bleep].

31:04.959 --> 31:06.584
This is for sure rock bottom.

31:06.584 --> 31:11.876
This is so ----ing
embarrassing.

31:11.876 --> 31:13.501
The only way you can go is up.

31:13.501 --> 31:15.167
I wish I was crying
over something better,

31:15.167 --> 31:24.584
what the [bleep]
is wrong with me?

31:24.584 --> 31:25.375
You have fun last night?

31:25.375 --> 31:27.959
-The whole night was good.
-Good.

31:27.959 --> 31:30.667
I think the new chick
is in shock.

31:30.667 --> 31:36.125
Really?

31:36.125 --> 31:38.709
Did I eat?

31:38.709 --> 31:42.501
[laughing]

31:42.501 --> 31:44.125
Yeah.

31:44.125 --> 31:48.876
I will never look
at spaghetti the same.

31:48.876 --> 31:50.292
How was your night?

31:50.292 --> 31:52.167
Nice and clean after
that Jacuzzi?

31:52.167 --> 31:53.584
Yeah.
What about Scarlett?

31:53.584 --> 31:55.250
Have you been
chatting up Scarlett?

31:55.250 --> 32:00.792
She's very pretty,
she's very cool, also.

32:00.792 --> 32:02.375
-Oh, dear.
-Yeah.

32:02.375 --> 32:04.000
How far did you guys get?

32:04.000 --> 32:07.167
We started the master, but
didn't do the toilets and stuff.

32:07.167 --> 32:10.250
We didn't get very far,
basically.

32:10.250 --> 32:12.959
Am I still second...
or third, and she's second?

32:12.959 --> 32:15.501
I haven't thought about it.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.125
I haven't seriously... and at
the moment, it doesn't matter.

32:17.125 --> 32:19.959
No, it doesn't matter.

32:19.959 --> 32:22.626
Not this again.

32:22.626 --> 32:25.501
I'd give Ashley direction and
she would go straight to you.

32:25.501 --> 32:27.292
I think she was upset
that she was third.

32:27.292 --> 32:29.125
I have no problem
respecting you.

32:29.125 --> 32:35.000
You lead the way I wanna be led.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.250
This title bullsh--
needs to stop.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.125
It doesn't mean anything.

32:39.125 --> 32:44.375
You're still a toilet cleaner.

32:44.375 --> 32:46.709
This boat looks like sh--.

32:46.709 --> 32:48.584
It's dusty as [bleep].

32:48.584 --> 32:51.626
Scarlett, so, apologies
for not being able

32:51.626 --> 32:52.584
to give you much time.

32:52.584 --> 32:55.542
It's a seriously
steep learning curve.

32:55.542 --> 32:57.250
-Ashley knows what she's doing.
-Right.

32:57.250 --> 32:58.959
She's worked really
hard this season.

32:58.959 --> 33:00.375
Obviously, you're gonna have
to lean on her quite a bit.

33:00.375 --> 33:01.709
-Right.
-And obviously, me.

33:01.709 --> 33:04.083
But I want you
girls to work as a team.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.167
Yeah.

33:05.167 --> 33:07.792
I have no experience like this.

33:07.792 --> 33:11.042
I don't know if I'm third stew,
I don't know if I'm second stew.

33:11.042 --> 33:13.459
I might throw up again.

33:13.459 --> 33:16.375
I mean, it's terrifying
coming into a new place

33:16.375 --> 33:20.709
with new people,
and I am freaking out.

33:20.709 --> 33:22.000
Ah!

33:22.000 --> 33:23.667
No, you're gonna
be great, honestly.

33:23.667 --> 33:24.959
Okay.

33:24.959 --> 33:26.167
Did you see any of the girls?

33:26.167 --> 33:27.792
None. How's the new girl?

33:27.792 --> 33:30.334
Oh, this is gonna be a long day.

33:30.334 --> 33:32.209
I love that Gary's
got a new challenge.

33:32.209 --> 33:36.000
The new pretty girl
comes to town.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.667
Oh, it's so good.

33:37.667 --> 33:40.167
You wanna show me how, like,
everything should be folded?

33:40.167 --> 33:42.667
Washcloths just thirds,
and then makeup,

33:42.667 --> 33:44.501
that's folded down, and then
you just flip the bottom,

33:44.501 --> 33:45.626
-and then...
-Just tuck it?

33:45.626 --> 33:46.834
Yeah.

33:46.834 --> 33:50.542
If it, like, looks obviously
dirty, then just go over it.

33:50.542 --> 33:53.167
You said you used the same
thing on the leather?

33:53.167 --> 33:55.542
Yeah, just the soap
and water, yeah.

33:55.542 --> 33:57.334
What'd you say
for the stainless?

33:57.334 --> 33:59.125
Just that white rag and vinegar.

33:59.125 --> 34:01.626
Have you worked on
a charter boat before?

34:01.626 --> 34:03.375
Uh, just days.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.375
Oh, and that's what
you were doing right before

34:05.375 --> 34:06.876
-you came here, right, yeah?
-Yeah.

34:06.876 --> 34:09.834
Even though I'm hung over
as [bleep] knowing that

34:09.834 --> 34:13.792
Scarlett has no experience
is giving me life right now.

34:13.792 --> 34:16.876
We need to hang up these robes.

34:16.876 --> 34:20.959
Just make 'em look pretty.

34:20.959 --> 34:22.959
Gary, Daisy, Marcos,

34:22.959 --> 34:24.334
can you guys meet me in
the crew mess

34:24.334 --> 34:29.167
for a preference
sheet meeting, please?

34:29.167 --> 34:30.959
-Oi!
-This is for you.

34:30.959 --> 34:32.792
Oh, they look really nice.

34:32.792 --> 34:35.292
So, Keely Washburn,
primary charter guest

34:35.292 --> 34:37.667
from Indianapolis, Indiana..

34:37.667 --> 34:39.501
-I remember Keely.
-You remember Keely?

34:39.501 --> 34:42.334
-And Keely, what do you think?
-Hi, girl, what are you doing?

34:42.334 --> 34:43.918
Oh, we have places today.

34:43.918 --> 34:45.542
Yeah, we're planning
our primary's dinner,

34:45.542 --> 34:47.209
so you don't have to
be here right now.

34:47.209 --> 34:49.584
Last year she chartered
PIII with Erica Rose

34:49.584 --> 34:52.000
and she's looking forward
to another trip in the Med

34:52.000 --> 34:53.959
with a new group of gals.

34:53.959 --> 34:56.125
Now, I think Jess was here.

34:56.125 --> 34:58.167
You think that we're doing this
to you because you're pretty?

34:58.167 --> 35:00.334
-I have no idea why you're--
-Where did you buy your mirror?

35:00.334 --> 35:01.834
-Because I'd like to get one.
-Okay.

35:01.834 --> 35:03.834
I'd like to put them
all over my house.

35:03.834 --> 35:05.501
After the charter I've had,

35:05.501 --> 35:08.834
I don't need to deal with
anymore disrespect from people.

35:08.834 --> 35:12.375
That is the last thing
that I want, another one.

35:12.375 --> 35:14.709
These ladies are ready
for nonstop drinks,

35:14.709 --> 35:16.250
relaxing in the sun,
lots of sailing,

35:16.250 --> 35:18.751
and dinner with the captain.

35:18.751 --> 35:19.876
Yay!

35:19.876 --> 35:22.417
Sh--.

35:22.417 --> 35:24.167
No, I would love
to have dinner with them.

35:24.167 --> 35:27.125
On night one, they would like
to do a wig and sequins party.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.584
The more colorful, the better.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.375
But most importantly,
they would like

35:30.375 --> 35:32.167
to go sailing as
much as possible.

35:32.167 --> 35:34.334
This person definitely
is gluten-free.

35:34.334 --> 35:38.792
Dislikes sushi, meat with a
lot of fat, weird seafood.

35:38.792 --> 35:42.167
Dislikes tomato-based dishes,
all dairy product.

35:42.167 --> 35:45.792
So, on night two they would
like a 10-course dinner.

35:45.792 --> 35:48.334
Okay, I think I'm doing
my dinner on night one.

35:48.334 --> 35:50.584
I don't wanna sit through
----ing 10 courses.

35:50.584 --> 35:52.751
In the past I did
a 16-course meal

35:52.751 --> 35:56.292
for a crew of 13,
but I wasn't alone.

35:56.292 --> 35:57.792
I have a sous chef with me.

35:57.792 --> 36:00.292
The cooking part is the
easy part, but the plating...

36:00.292 --> 36:02.459
it's not easy.
It's not easy.

36:02.459 --> 36:05.375
Ten courses with
all the dislikes.

36:05.375 --> 36:06.459
I'm just gonna give
them tacos...

36:06.459 --> 36:08.709
chicken tacos, beef tacos.

36:08.709 --> 36:10.209
[laughing]

36:10.209 --> 36:11.959
Okay, good, all right.

36:11.959 --> 36:14.792
-Cool, good job.
-Thank you.

36:14.792 --> 36:16.375
All done.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.667
Hey, girls, you can finish
in, like, 10 minutes.

36:19.667 --> 36:20.792
Copy.

36:20.792 --> 36:23.334
Let's call it a day,
we'll rinse down tomorrow.

36:23.334 --> 36:26.876
Are any beach clubs open?

36:26.876 --> 36:28.375
Oh, I need to go to bed.

36:28.375 --> 36:30.042
I'm ----ing tired.

36:30.042 --> 36:31.459
-Good night, mate.
-Good night, brother.

36:31.459 --> 36:33.417
But don't work too hard,
you know the rules.

36:33.417 --> 36:34.417
No.

36:34.417 --> 36:37.792
-Missed you.
-Did you?

36:37.792 --> 36:42.167
-How are you?
-Good.

36:42.167 --> 36:43.626
Never in my life.

36:43.626 --> 36:46.250
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

36:46.250 --> 36:47.501
I'm so glad you're here.

36:47.501 --> 36:48.792
Finally, someone that gets me.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.667
Oh, yeah.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.250
Two nights?

36:52.250 --> 36:53.959
All girls?
Oh [bleep].

36:53.959 --> 36:56.667
I was actually thinking about
getting to know you better,

36:56.667 --> 37:01.667
but I think it's gonna
prove to be quite difficult.

37:01.667 --> 37:03.209
Yeah, because I don't think
Ashley's gonna give us

37:03.209 --> 37:04.501
the time of the day to get
to know each other.

37:04.501 --> 37:06.167
Yeah.

37:06.167 --> 37:07.792
-Hey, guys.
-Thanks, brother.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.959
Hello.

37:09.959 --> 37:16.667
Oh.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.959
I do think I deserve
to be promoted.

37:19.959 --> 37:21.000
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.042
No, I don't want you to either.

37:22.042 --> 37:23.375
Yeah.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.876
Ashley'll get over
it eventually.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.000
Mm, I hope so.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.375
I wanna be friends
with everyone,

37:27.375 --> 37:29.000
and I wanna leave
this season on a high.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.375
Yeah. No, same.

37:30.375 --> 37:34.876
I want it to be all good
vibes between everybody.

37:34.876 --> 37:36.167
[laughing]

37:36.167 --> 37:38.584
Lies, you came here
to stir up trouble.

37:38.584 --> 37:40.584
No, I swear.
No, I did not.

37:40.584 --> 37:42.334
This is the wrong boat
if you don't like drama.

37:42.334 --> 37:42.334
-No, I'm kidding. Yeah.
-There's gonna be drama.

37:42.334 --> 37:51.334
Oh sh--.

37:51.334 --> 37:52.375
Okay, I'm going to bed.

37:52.375 --> 37:54.042
Good night, everyone.

37:54.042 --> 37:56.918
Good night.

37:56.918 --> 38:12.584
See you tomorrow.

38:12.584 --> 38:14.083
How are you, honey?

38:14.083 --> 38:15.167
You smell good.

38:15.167 --> 38:27.751
Finally.

38:27.751 --> 38:43.959
Oh, 100 percent.

38:43.959 --> 39:02.375
Oh, yeah.

39:02.375 --> 39:03.542
Yeah.

39:03.542 --> 39:09.209
I am so proud of my bed.

39:09.209 --> 39:10.334
Ready, boy?

39:10.334 --> 39:12.250
Yeah, man.

39:12.250 --> 39:13.626
-Oh, did I get ya?
-Yeah.

39:13.626 --> 39:16.501
Did I get ya? Yeah!

39:16.501 --> 39:19.417
-Morning.
-Morning.

39:19.417 --> 39:21.501
-How's it going?
-Good, mate, how you doing?

39:21.501 --> 39:22.667
Good, good.

39:22.667 --> 39:24.083
-Morning.
-How you guys doing?

39:24.083 --> 39:25.375
-Good. Glenn...
-Yes?

39:25.375 --> 39:27.792
...can I have Scarlett's
CV, please?

39:27.792 --> 39:33.042
Of course.

39:33.042 --> 39:40.667
Because of the ----ing lip, so
it's gonna be a little awkward.

39:40.667 --> 39:42.709
Turn it the other way.

39:42.709 --> 39:44.584
Scarlett is clueless.

39:44.584 --> 39:47.375
This is definitely the
confidence boost that I need.

39:47.375 --> 39:49.209
-That's better.
-There we go.

39:49.209 --> 39:50.459
It feels so good.

39:50.459 --> 39:52.959
Trying and make it
look pretty-ish.

39:52.959 --> 39:57.584
Yeah.

39:57.584 --> 39:58.792
It's bizarre.

39:58.792 --> 40:00.542
What does it ----ing matter?

40:00.542 --> 40:01.792
She's missing the point.

40:01.792 --> 40:03.292
She should be walking away
from this

40:03.292 --> 40:05.083
with a good
reference from me.

40:05.083 --> 40:07.459
Stop focusing on the title.

40:07.459 --> 40:09.626
And then I know this
is just a chance

40:09.626 --> 40:12.584
for her to get
one up on Scarlett.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.709
I'm not letting it happen.

40:14.709 --> 40:16.792
They haven't started
bossing each other around

40:16.792 --> 40:17.584
or anything yet?

40:17.584 --> 40:20.959
-No, Ashley's dying to.
-Yeah.

40:20.959 --> 40:28.083
-And this is just...
-Jealous.

40:28.083 --> 40:30.042
If you wanna start
vacuuming again, you know,

40:30.042 --> 40:32.292
just kinda like once-over
upstairs by the bar.

40:32.292 --> 40:33.334
-Okay.
-Cool.

40:33.334 --> 40:34.459
Thank you so much.

40:34.459 --> 40:36.125
-Did it work?
-Done.

40:36.125 --> 40:37.667
Oh, yeah.

40:37.667 --> 40:40.209
Okay, I always get these
----ing things wrong.

40:40.209 --> 40:43.167
So, that is the side that
they're gonna lie on.

40:43.167 --> 40:50.375
The two girls are the same,
not much on their CVs.

40:50.375 --> 40:52.918
And it's a shame, because I
would have given it to Ashley

40:52.918 --> 40:58.083
if she wasn't
so obsessed with it.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.751
Yeah, that's a good idea.

40:59.751 --> 41:00.876
Oh, boy.

41:00.876 --> 41:04.751
Daisy, have you given any
thought into second stew?

41:04.751 --> 41:08.125
Do you want me to just give
my case, or my...

41:08.125 --> 41:10.417
Well, you are dying to, so...

41:10.417 --> 41:13.292
No, I just... I mean,
I think from having

41:13.292 --> 41:16.292
the conversation with her
just about experience-wise

41:16.292 --> 41:21.959
and what she's done, it's not
even close to what I have done.

41:21.959 --> 41:23.709
She hasn't done
an overnight charter,

41:23.709 --> 41:26.375
I had to show
her how to make beds.

41:26.375 --> 41:28.167
Like, if she was
leading service,

41:28.167 --> 41:30.709
I feel like I would still...
I would be leading service,

41:30.709 --> 41:32.417
because I would be
having to tell her

41:32.417 --> 41:34.417
what was going on, or,
like, what to do.

41:34.417 --> 41:36.083
-A second stew...
-Yeah.

41:36.083 --> 41:38.959
...is somebody who's there,
you know, to keep longevity

41:38.959 --> 41:41.959
so you get a pay rise,
so you're given a title.

41:41.959 --> 41:44.250
It's not about
bossing each other around

41:44.250 --> 41:46.792
or being above someone else.

41:46.792 --> 41:49.250
I don't feel like
you're still grasping it.

41:49.250 --> 41:50.959
It's not that I don't think
you deserve it,

41:50.959 --> 41:55.167
but I think you're missing
the teamwork aspect.

41:55.167 --> 41:57.626
And until you figure that out,

41:57.626 --> 42:02.292
the two of you are
gonna be the same.

42:02.292 --> 42:05.792
I have more experience than her.

42:05.792 --> 42:06.959
You're always gonna know more

42:06.959 --> 42:08.792
because you know the
boat better.

42:08.792 --> 42:10.459
You're still missing it.
It's not about knowing more.

42:10.459 --> 42:12.626
I want you to work as a team

42:12.626 --> 42:17.959
and get this hierarchy
out of your head.

42:17.959 --> 42:19.792
Next, on "Below Deck
Sailing Yacht"...

42:19.792 --> 42:21.626
-Hey, ladies.
-Hi! Hello!

42:21.626 --> 42:22.751
Did you see the chef?

42:22.751 --> 42:23.959
Hottest thing I've ever seen.

42:23.959 --> 42:26.959
Muy caliente.

42:26.959 --> 42:30.334
I'm here to fill any chef
fantasy they have.

42:30.334 --> 42:31.959
Ow... okay.

42:31.959 --> 42:34.167
Gary, do you really
need a stew for drinks?

42:34.167 --> 42:35.918
I just think it looks more
professional when I'm driving,

42:35.918 --> 42:37.375
so I don't have to give
them drinks or stuff.

42:37.375 --> 42:38.709
I'm not gonna argue with you,

42:38.709 --> 42:40.417
I just think it's
more professional

42:40.417 --> 42:42.751
-having a stew for the guests.
-Okay, then I'll send someone.

42:42.751 --> 42:44.876
Don't you dare accuse me of
not caring about the guests.

42:44.876 --> 42:46.709
Such a ----ing asshole.

42:46.709 --> 42:48.626
I'm not gonna lie, I've got
a little crush on you.

42:48.626 --> 42:49.751
Yeah.

42:49.751 --> 42:51.417
There's definitely
chemistry there.

42:51.417 --> 42:53.501
Maybe it's mutual,
maybe it shouldn't be.

42:53.501 --> 42:55.167
The way she looks at
me tells me

42:55.167 --> 42:59.167
that she wants something more
than just to be friends.
