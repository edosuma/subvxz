WEBVTT

00:00.399 --> 00:02.069
Man:
All you have as a cop
is other cops.

00:02.322 --> 00:03.223
But we walked away.

00:03.256 --> 00:05.158
Woman #1:
We all thought he was guilty.

00:05.191 --> 00:06.927
Woman #2:
After the trial,
I had to get counseling

00:06.960 --> 00:08.862
just so I could sleep.

00:08.895 --> 00:10.764
Woman #1:
There was all that proof.

00:10.797 --> 00:13.233
Man:
We all turned our back
on Charlie Crews.

00:13.266 --> 00:16.102
In his first years,

00:16.136 --> 00:20.240
he was in that prison hospital

00:20.273 --> 00:21.307
more--
more than he was out.

00:21.341 --> 00:24.344
[Grunting]

00:25.912 --> 00:27.748
Cop doing time, please.

00:27.781 --> 00:29.349
Broke nearly every bone
in his body.

00:29.382 --> 00:30.784
[Grunting]

00:30.817 --> 00:32.819
I heard they cut him
real bad too.

00:32.853 --> 00:33.720
Over 100 stitches.

00:33.754 --> 00:35.856
About 241 stitches.

00:38.759 --> 00:40.694
Woman:
I mean, the jury was only out
for an hour.

00:40.727 --> 00:41.527
There was all that proof.

00:41.561 --> 00:43.830
Man:
After the case was reopened,

00:43.864 --> 00:46.299
we found that none
of the physical evidence

00:46.332 --> 00:49.302
on scene matched Officer Crews.

00:49.335 --> 00:50.837
Woman:
I wasn't the only one.

00:50.871 --> 00:53.039
We all thought he was guilty.

00:53.073 --> 00:54.708
Male interviewer:
Did Charlie tell you
he didn't do it?

00:54.741 --> 00:56.209
Yes.

00:56.242 --> 00:57.811
Interviewer:
And how did you feel
when you found out

00:57.844 --> 00:59.112
he was being exonerated?

00:59.145 --> 01:01.214
That he was innocent?

01:06.386 --> 01:09.790
I don't wanna do this anymore.

01:09.823 --> 01:10.824
[Grunts]

01:13.760 --> 01:14.594
As I said
at the press conference

01:14.627 --> 01:16.229
after Detective Crews
was exonerated,

01:16.262 --> 01:18.999
life was his sentence,

01:19.032 --> 01:21.702
and life is what he got back.

01:32.345 --> 01:34.981
Reese:
Crews!

01:35.015 --> 01:37.217
Detective Crews!

01:37.250 --> 01:38.418
Detective Crews!

01:38.451 --> 01:41.054
You are Detective Crews,
aren't you?

01:41.087 --> 01:43.056
Yeah.

01:43.089 --> 01:45.158
I guess I am.

01:45.191 --> 01:46.960
Okay, well, would you like
to be sure?

01:46.993 --> 01:48.995
Because we're about
to walk into a crime scene.

01:49.029 --> 01:51.097
I'm sure.

01:51.131 --> 01:53.666
Great.

01:57.938 --> 01:59.039
Are you Reese?

01:59.072 --> 02:01.742
Detective Reese.

02:03.376 --> 02:05.211
Woman:
Uh-huh.

02:05.245 --> 02:06.679
10-4.

02:16.823 --> 02:18.959
Crews, it's a kid in there.

02:18.992 --> 02:20.426
It's your first day back.

02:20.460 --> 02:22.929
If you don't think you can
handle it, I can do it myself.

02:33.206 --> 02:36.142
[Heavy sigh]

02:51.191 --> 02:54.795
Small caliber, close range.
Probably not a lot of noise.

02:54.828 --> 02:56.396
No one reported
hearing anything.

02:56.429 --> 03:00.133
The bullet was
a through and through.

03:00.516 --> 03:01.484
Is that the kid's dog?

03:01.517 --> 03:02.418
Yeah, he won't move.

03:02.452 --> 03:05.221
Reese:
Did you find the slug?

03:05.255 --> 03:06.222
Zerco:
No, ma'am.

03:06.256 --> 03:08.158
Did you look for it?

03:08.191 --> 03:10.626
Yes, detective.
We looked for it.

03:10.660 --> 03:13.596
Did you ask the dog?

03:13.629 --> 03:14.630
Zerco:
Did we ask the dog?

03:14.664 --> 03:15.365
Krebbs:
We did not ask the dog, no.

03:15.398 --> 03:19.135
No, sir.
We did not ask the dog.

03:27.910 --> 03:29.845
Hey. Shh.

03:29.879 --> 03:31.647
Hey.

03:31.681 --> 03:33.649
Hey. Hey.

03:38.754 --> 03:40.890
[Softly]
Good boy.

03:40.923 --> 03:42.592
[Whispering to dog]

03:45.828 --> 03:48.598
There's a bullet here
beneath the skin.

03:48.631 --> 03:50.700
Dog must have caught the bullet
in the gut

03:50.733 --> 03:52.202
after it exited the kid.

03:52.235 --> 03:54.570
All right,
get the dog to a vet.

03:54.604 --> 03:57.473
Get the bullet out
and to ballistics.

03:57.507 --> 03:59.542
What are you doing way
over here?

03:59.575 --> 04:01.311
Krebbs:
Get me animal reg
to my location.

04:01.344 --> 04:02.478
Did you bring something over?

04:02.512 --> 04:05.315
Your master's over there.

04:08.751 --> 04:11.587
Did you bring something over?
Huh?

04:11.621 --> 04:14.457
Reese:
Detective Crews.

04:14.490 --> 04:16.892
Detective!

04:16.926 --> 04:19.329
Zerco:
Hey, hold on.

04:19.362 --> 04:20.796
That looks like a--

04:20.830 --> 04:21.964
is that a finger?

04:21.997 --> 04:23.699
Yeah.

04:34.544 --> 04:36.512
Dog must have took a bullet
for the kid,

04:36.546 --> 04:39.782
then took
the shooter's finger off.

04:39.815 --> 04:41.817
Anyone ever love you
that much?

04:49.859 --> 04:50.760
If I got out
after all that time,

04:50.793 --> 04:52.395
I got all that money,
I sure as [bleep]

04:52.428 --> 04:53.896
Would not be going
back to work.

04:53.929 --> 04:56.499
Now I handle
his settlement money.

04:56.532 --> 04:57.900
Interviewer:
And how much would that be?

04:57.933 --> 05:01.671
That's undisclosed
by court order.

05:01.704 --> 05:03.873
Interviewer:
And what about details
of the settlement?

05:03.906 --> 05:06.776
I'm not at liberty to say.

05:06.809 --> 05:08.278
Yeah, I-I heard he got
$5 million.

05:08.311 --> 05:09.412
Can--can I say [bleep]?

05:09.445 --> 05:11.247
5?
I heard it was 50.

05:13.283 --> 05:14.850
So you wanna have
the talk?

05:14.884 --> 05:16.852
Which talk is that?

05:16.886 --> 05:18.554
About how you didn't want me
as your partner,

05:18.588 --> 05:19.555
and you're looking
to transfer out

05:19.589 --> 05:20.856
as soon as you can.

05:20.890 --> 05:23.726
Nope.
I don't wanna have that talk.

05:23.759 --> 05:25.628
You wanna have the talk
about what you did?

05:25.661 --> 05:26.896
Who you pissed off to get
partnered up with me?

05:26.929 --> 05:29.499
I was handed a slip of paper.
It said you're my new partner.

05:29.532 --> 05:30.666
It didn't mention why,
and I didn't ask.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.835
Getting stuck with me isn't
exactly a promotion for you.

05:32.868 --> 05:34.804
Detective, it might be a habit
of yours, but I don't wanna have

05:34.837 --> 05:36.939
the "what are you in for"
talk either.

05:36.972 --> 05:39.775
Not a big talker.

05:39.809 --> 05:42.612
See, I've learned something
about you already.

05:42.645 --> 05:45.948
John was not my biological son.

05:45.981 --> 05:47.917
He was Alyssa's
from her first marriage.

05:47.950 --> 05:50.853
We have another one
of our own,

05:50.886 --> 05:51.787
a daughter.

05:51.821 --> 05:54.690
You adopted John?

05:54.724 --> 05:56.058
Yeah, I always think
of him as my own.

05:56.091 --> 05:59.061
As a member of the family.

05:59.094 --> 06:01.864
I thought of--
thought of him as...

06:04.099 --> 06:06.736
Where is John's
biological father?

06:06.769 --> 06:07.937
Jail.

06:07.970 --> 06:09.972
He's, uh...

06:10.005 --> 06:13.609
Possession
with intent to distribute.

06:13.643 --> 06:15.711
He's got ten more years.

06:18.047 --> 06:19.649
The--the Scout troop

06:19.682 --> 06:21.717
that John is a--

06:21.751 --> 06:24.687
was a part of
is made up entirely

06:24.720 --> 06:28.758
of boys who have fathers
who are doing time.

06:28.791 --> 06:30.960
All right,
we're almost through.

06:30.993 --> 06:32.528
You reported
a break-in last month?

06:32.562 --> 06:34.564
Yeah, um.

06:34.597 --> 06:35.365
[Clears throat]

06:35.398 --> 06:37.733
Some cash and jewelry
was taken.

06:37.767 --> 06:38.868
No one was caught.

06:38.901 --> 06:41.704
We changed the locks
and the alarms.

06:41.737 --> 06:42.705
Makes me paranoid.

06:42.738 --> 06:43.739
I--what?
I don't understand.

06:43.773 --> 06:44.740
Pot.

06:44.774 --> 06:47.843
Just makes me, you know,
overprocess everything.

06:47.877 --> 06:50.045
I end up spinning myself
into a freak-out.

06:50.229 --> 06:51.864
You get high today, Warren?

06:51.897 --> 06:53.599
Yeah?
It's Sunday.

06:53.633 --> 06:54.934
A little wake and bake?
Huh?

06:54.967 --> 06:56.101
Because in the next few hours,

06:56.135 --> 06:57.637
there's gonna be all kinds
of law enforcement

06:57.670 --> 06:58.638
crawling all over
your beautiful house.

06:58.671 --> 06:59.605
Detective.

06:59.639 --> 07:01.841
They turn up a bag
of high-grade chronic, well,

07:01.874 --> 07:03.275
I think you need to be here
for your family today--

07:03.308 --> 07:04.276
detective.
And you do not--

07:04.309 --> 07:05.778
Detective!

07:05.811 --> 07:06.912
May I speak with you?

07:06.946 --> 07:08.080
Sure thing.

07:08.113 --> 07:09.515
[Whispers]
Why don't you go
to the bathroom?

07:09.549 --> 07:11.216
When you're done,
make sure you flush real well.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.686
Okay?
You know, maybe flush twice.

07:13.719 --> 07:15.688
You understand?

07:17.823 --> 07:19.859
Excuse me.

07:21.727 --> 07:22.895
What the hell was that?

07:22.928 --> 07:24.196
What, you wanna see
the dead boy's dad

07:24.229 --> 07:25.865
get locked up for holding
a little hay?

07:25.898 --> 07:27.967
Stepdad, and a possible suspect
in a murder--

07:28.000 --> 07:29.802
in a child murder.

07:29.835 --> 07:31.303
That man didn't kill anyone,
and you know it.

07:31.336 --> 07:33.539
He's got all his fingers,
and he seemed really sad.

07:33.573 --> 07:34.807
You just broke the law.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.008
I am your superior detective.

07:36.041 --> 07:37.577
I'm responsible
for your actions.

07:37.610 --> 07:39.178
If you get jammed up for this,
I get jammed up for this.

07:39.211 --> 07:41.046
Hey, we're both
adults here.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.148
You got a problem,
turn me over to the rat squad.

07:43.182 --> 07:45.117
[Cell phone ringing]

07:49.889 --> 07:51.190
Are you gonna get that?

07:51.223 --> 07:52.625
Oh.

07:52.658 --> 07:54.293
A phone this small
in your pocket.

07:54.326 --> 07:55.861
It's science fiction,
right?

07:55.895 --> 07:58.030
This living
in the future--

08:01.934 --> 08:04.970
Reese:
Was John having trouble
in school?

08:05.004 --> 08:05.871
Alyssa:
No.

08:05.905 --> 08:07.106
Reese:
In the neighborhood?

08:07.139 --> 08:08.340
Alyssa:
No.

08:08.373 --> 08:11.611
Other kids in the scout troop?

08:11.644 --> 08:12.912
What about the break-in?

08:12.945 --> 08:14.680
He was with me
when that happened.

08:14.714 --> 08:15.948
John had nothing
to do with that.

08:15.981 --> 08:17.983
I wasn't
suggesting that, ma'am.

08:18.017 --> 08:20.285
No, I'm sorry.
Of course you weren't.

08:20.319 --> 08:22.054
We're gonna need
to ask you a few questions

08:22.087 --> 08:23.756
about your ex-husband mark.

08:32.131 --> 08:35.300
Mark wasn't a bad man
when I married him.

08:35.334 --> 08:36.501
He had a problem with drugs.

08:36.535 --> 08:39.805
But when he came out of jail
the first time, he'd changed.

08:39.839 --> 08:42.742
He was mean.

08:42.775 --> 08:45.210
When he went back in,
I knew I had to get away.

08:45.244 --> 08:49.281
So you just dumped
the divorce papers in the mail.

08:49.314 --> 08:50.616
What did you just say?

08:50.650 --> 08:51.717
What'd you just say?

08:51.751 --> 08:54.954
What?

08:54.987 --> 08:58.991
What did I just say?

08:59.024 --> 09:00.359
Two of the other dads
in the Scout troop have records

09:00.392 --> 09:02.361
of violence against children,

09:02.394 --> 09:05.230
but both those dads
are in jail.

09:05.264 --> 09:07.967
I'm gonna call in,
see if they got a hit

09:08.000 --> 09:09.134
off that finger we found.

09:09.168 --> 09:10.703
It was
pretty chewed up, but...

09:10.736 --> 09:13.673
Okay, okay.
You're mad at me.

09:13.706 --> 09:15.274
Mad? No, I'm not mad.

09:15.307 --> 09:17.677
I mean, I don't even think
there is a word for what I am.

09:17.710 --> 09:20.212
What you did to that husband,
I kinda get, okay?

09:20.245 --> 09:21.380
I mean, I guess I kind of get,

09:21.413 --> 09:22.648
but what you said
to that wife--

09:22.682 --> 09:24.917
I know.
That one was me.

09:24.950 --> 09:27.119
It was my fault.
I take responsibility, Reese.

09:27.152 --> 09:29.755
I wasn't in the moment.

09:29.789 --> 09:31.691
If I had stayed in the moment,
if I had stayed present,

09:31.724 --> 09:34.126
I would have been okay,
but I didn't.

09:34.159 --> 09:36.295
I was thinking
about where we're going next.

09:36.328 --> 09:38.063
So I left the moment
just when I should have been

09:38.097 --> 09:39.832
completely in the moment,
which is when people

09:39.865 --> 09:41.266
usually leave the moment
because the moment is just

09:41.300 --> 09:43.435
too much for her.

09:43.468 --> 09:46.806
I mean, the moment is pretty
much always too much, you know?

09:50.042 --> 09:53.879
I was thinking
about where we're going next.

09:57.349 --> 09:59.018
Must feel good to come in

09:59.051 --> 10:02.221
without a cavity search.
Right, detective?

10:02.254 --> 10:04.389
'Course, you want one
for old times' sake,

10:04.423 --> 10:05.958
we could work something out.

10:05.991 --> 10:07.827
Just take us
to Rawls, okay?

10:07.860 --> 10:09.695
Sure thing, sweetheart.

10:31.951 --> 10:34.720
They won't let me go
to his funeral.

10:34.754 --> 10:37.489
My own son's funeral.

10:37.522 --> 10:38.758
Mr. Rawls, I'd like
for you to think and see

raise your voice to her.

10:45.798 --> 10:49.268

my voice to her.

You gonna stop me?

10:50.369 --> 10:53.906
Do you hate cops?

10:53.939 --> 10:57.076
Oh, yeah.

10:57.109 --> 10:59.078
Well, I hate cops too.

11:02.848 --> 11:05.284
Mr. Rawls, have you made
any enemies here in prison

11:05.317 --> 11:06.085
that would want
to hurt your family?

11:06.118 --> 11:10.422
Get back at you
by killing your son?

11:10.455 --> 11:13.358
Rawls:
Yeah, I got enemies.

11:13.392 --> 11:14.760
But none
that would touch my son.

11:14.794 --> 11:16.195
Why is that?

11:16.228 --> 11:19.064
Because everyone's got family.

11:19.098 --> 11:22.935
That's right.

Mr. Rawls, you last saw John
two weeks ago

11:27.339 --> 11:28.407
when the Scout troop came.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.210
How did he seem to you?
Was he in any kind of trouble?

11:31.243 --> 11:35.147
Last time I saw John,
he kept saying

11:35.180 --> 11:38.317
how he thought
I shouldn't be here.

11:38.350 --> 11:41.320
It's like he needed
to believe it.

what really goes on.

11:53.465 --> 11:54.599

He means convicts.

11:55.834 --> 11:57.802

You don't like that word?

11:57.836 --> 11:58.837
What do you care?

12:01.473 --> 12:02.374
Come on, Crews.
Let's go.

12:02.407 --> 12:03.558
Yeah, we know
who you are.

your 12 years.

12:05.194 --> 12:08.063
Maybe you were innocent.
Maybe not.

12:08.097 --> 12:09.464
It don't make
no difference to us

12:09.498 --> 12:10.465

what you did

12:10.499 --> 12:11.733
to that correctional officer

12:11.766 --> 12:13.368

12:21.493 --> 12:25.430
Anger ruins joy,
steals the goodness of my mind,

12:25.464 --> 12:27.499

to say terrible things.

12:27.532 --> 12:29.668
Overcoming anger
brings peace of mind,

leads to a mind
without regrets.

If I overcome anger,
I will be delightful

12:35.307 --> 12:37.242
Are you making fun
of us?

12:37.276 --> 12:40.745
It is the universe
that makes fun of us all.

12:48.720 --> 12:52.457
Why exactly would the universe
make fun of us all?

I can do about that.

you could do about it?
