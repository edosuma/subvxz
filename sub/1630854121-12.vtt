that done at another facility

10:38.713 --> 10:39.863
if you feel more comfortable.

10:39.881 --> 10:40.880
Oh, so I can go?

10:41.032 --> 10:42.215
No.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.217
We need a CT so we can rule out
anything serious

10:44.311 --> 10:46.219
-from your head trauma.
-(Betz sighs)

10:46.371 --> 10:48.538
You were unconscious
at the scene.

10:48.631 --> 10:51.374
Well, sooner the better.

10:51.376 --> 10:53.968
Well, unfortunately,
CT is all backed up.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.045
Due to budget cuts,
we're a bit short-staffed.

10:56.064 --> 10:57.230
Do you think I'm stupid?

10:57.382 --> 10:58.715
I know what's happening here!

10:58.733 --> 11:00.733
You're-you're trying
to teach me a lesson!

11:00.827 --> 11:03.578
Well, I don't have
to put up with it!

11:04.331 --> 11:05.813
Now get me out of here now!

11:05.832 --> 11:07.849
Get me my...

11:07.851 --> 11:09.376
(ragged breathing)

11:11.396 --> 11:12.745
-(monitor beeping)
-Ow.

11:12.898 --> 11:15.064
ST elevation.
He's having a heart attack.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.508
(pained groaning)

11:16.735 --> 11:18.009
All right, let's go.

11:18.161 --> 11:20.011
Activate the cath lab.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.582
It's hard to believe
anyone walked away from it.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.508
She landed that helicopter
at the intersection

11:34.528 --> 11:36.419
of 13th and Piedmont.

11:36.512 --> 11:37.987
Can you imagine?

11:39.424 --> 11:40.865
(sighs)

11:41.092 --> 11:42.534
Oh, no.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.038
Multiple contusions.

11:47.190 --> 11:48.856
Sulcal and cisternal effacement.

11:48.875 --> 11:52.711
Swelling is severe already.
I'll book an OR. And you...

11:52.862 --> 11:56.381
I know. Slam her with diuretics,
hyperosmolar therapy.

11:56.608 --> 11:59.759
I'll bring her up.
Thanks, Billie.

12:00.962 --> 12:02.595
Of course.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.877
(sirens wailing)

12:09.896 --> 12:12.147
(indistinct chatter)

12:13.959 --> 12:16.109
(phone buzzing)

12:20.574 --> 12:21.647
Hey, Marko.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.909
Whoa, you actually
answered this time.

12:25.061 --> 12:26.393
I was not expecting that.

12:26.562 --> 12:28.638
<i> DEVON:</i>
<i> I'm sorry, work has been nuts,</i>

12:28.807 --> 12:30.564
-and I've had some personal
stuff to deal with.
<i> -Pravesh, please.</i>

12:30.658 --> 12:32.900
I've been around long enough
to know when I'm being ghosted.

12:32.919 --> 12:33.901
All right?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.645
Just be straight with me.

12:35.663 --> 12:38.572
You've lost interest in my
longevity aspirations, right?

12:38.592 --> 12:40.425
<i> Listen, I've reviewed</i>
<i> the materials.</i>

12:40.576 --> 12:43.244
And I just don't feel like it
aligns with my interests.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.413
Y-You think it's bogus crap
and you're not a bogus doctor?

12:46.433 --> 12:47.581
I'm not the right guy.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.100
And you deserve someone
who's passionate,

12:49.327 --> 12:50.676
-and that isn't me.
-(pager beeping)

12:50.829 --> 12:53.587
<i> Look, sorry I have to go.</i>

12:53.607 --> 12:55.331
But listen, good luck.

12:55.333 --> 12:56.441
I am positive that you're gonna

12:56.592 --> 12:59.486
find the right collaborator,
okay?

13:00.781 --> 13:02.113
Check it out.

13:03.174 --> 13:05.174
-You made those?
-Mm-hmm.

13:05.226 --> 13:06.342
Oh, they're adorable.

13:06.361 --> 13:09.012
When did you get
so good at knitting?

13:09.030 --> 13:10.680
They have a class here.
As therapy.

13:10.698 --> 13:13.041
It's really, really relaxing.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.354
Hey, will you give those to AJ?

13:18.447 --> 13:20.632
To give to the boys from me?

13:20.783 --> 13:22.467
Of course.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.638
I really miss them.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.390
Of course you do.

13:30.126 --> 13:31.309
You'll see them soon.

13:31.536 --> 13:36.372
AJ must regret this so much,
having babies with me.

13:36.391 --> 13:38.483
Look, it has not
been easy, okay?

13:38.634 --> 13:40.726
For either of you.

13:40.895 --> 13:42.045
But if there's one thing I know,
it's that

13:42.063 --> 13:43.062
AJ doesn't regret a thing.

13:44.049 --> 13:47.534
Arjun and Elijah are the two
gifts he never even saw coming.

13:53.149 --> 13:54.648
I hope when the boys are older,

13:54.668 --> 13:57.001
they are for each other
what you are for me.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.046
Everything.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.877
(beeping steadily)

14:07.163 --> 14:09.347
His blood pressure is still
soft, despite the pressor.

14:09.574 --> 14:12.166
I'm worried he's going
into cardiogenic shock.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.577
AUSTIN:
Once we find the lesion
and open it up,

14:14.596 --> 14:16.062
he should rebound.

14:17.098 --> 14:19.190
Oh, wow, look at that.

14:19.267 --> 14:20.358
Two prior stents.

14:20.585 --> 14:23.086
Yeah, this isn't
his first heart attack.

14:23.104 --> 14:25.271
None of this was
on his medical record.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.107
I can't believe our governor
is not smart enough

14:28.201 --> 14:30.684
to give us an honest
medical history.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.613
AUSTIN:
Well, fake tough guys
like Betz are always afraid

14:33.765 --> 14:35.540
that health problems
will make them look weak.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.116
His pressure's still dropping.
Are we close?

14:37.285 --> 14:40.103
I think I found it.
The culprit lesion.

14:40.121 --> 14:44.123
Bingo. Obtuse marginal branch
in the circumflex.

14:44.275 --> 14:45.958
CONRAD:
That's a tiny vessel.

14:46.127 --> 14:47.534
Opening something that small

14:47.554 --> 14:48.702
won't improve his cardiac
function that much.

14:48.796 --> 14:50.630
He'll still be dependent
on pressors.

14:50.798 --> 14:52.949
AUSTIN:
Agreed. This man's heart was in
bad shape before the accident.

14:52.967 --> 14:56.543
JAMES:
Yeah, he's lucky he didn't
arrest during the crash.

14:56.712 --> 14:58.062
All right, well, let's open
the vessel up

14:58.214 --> 15:00.398
and see what else we can do.

15:01.793 --> 15:04.051
JOURNALIST:
We will have
an official statement

15:04.145 --> 15:05.069
a little bit later in the day,
but for now

15:05.221 --> 15:07.054
the cause of the accident

15:07.073 --> 15:10.149
-is still under investigation,
but we will be releasing...
-Dr. Sullivan.

15:10.301 --> 15:12.243
-Hey.
-You're back.

15:12.395 --> 15:13.394
Yeah.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.229
How was, uh, your trek
across España?

15:15.323 --> 15:16.973
Great, yeah, really something.

15:16.991 --> 15:19.250
I've always wanted to do that.
I'd love to pick your brain

15:19.477 --> 15:21.336
when you've recovered
from the jet lag.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.904
-Sure, a-anytime.
-Yeah.

15:23.998 --> 15:26.758
-Good to see you, Dr. Feldman.
-Likewise.

15:26.909 --> 15:28.484
LIV:
Considering what
he went through,

15:28.577 --> 15:30.670
it's nothing less
than a miracle.

15:30.764 --> 15:34.248
But the doctors expect him
to make a full recovery.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.175
<i>However, he will be transferred</i>

15:36.327 --> 15:39.178
<i> to a top-tier hospital</i>
<i> for the remainder of his care.</i>

15:39.330 --> 15:40.438
<i> -I can...</i>
-(remote clicks)

15:40.589 --> 15:41.940
She's selling scrapes
and bruises

15:42.091 --> 15:43.683
when I just heard from Raptor
that the man

15:43.835 --> 15:45.851
was a cardiac time bomb
even before the accident.

15:46.004 --> 15:48.429
BELL: And if they're not honest
about his prior heart issues,

15:48.448 --> 15:49.839
they may spin it

15:49.857 --> 15:52.099
to make it look like
we withheld appropriate care.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.952
We have got to get him
transferred.

15:54.179 --> 15:55.995
But so far everyone is full.

15:58.016 --> 16:00.107
AUSTIN:
And what we discovered is
that you've had two stents

16:00.276 --> 16:01.626
and two prior heart attacks.

16:01.777 --> 16:03.869
None of which appears
in your medical records.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.588
Look, let me...

16:06.782 --> 16:08.207
(gasps)

16:08.359 --> 16:10.468
Let me make something clear.

16:10.619 --> 16:13.287
Neither you nor anyone else
in this hospital

16:13.381 --> 16:17.308
are authorized to speak publicly
about my medical condition,

16:17.460 --> 16:19.126
past or present.

16:19.145 --> 16:24.874
Now, can you please check
with Dr. Voss about my transfer?

16:24.892 --> 16:27.210
AUSTIN:
Yeah, that's not going to be
so easy, Governor.

16:27.228 --> 16:29.487
We opened what we could
in the cath lab,

16:29.638 --> 16:32.139
but your cardiac function
must've been bad from the start.

16:32.233 --> 16:35.809
And right now your heart
is working only at ten percent.

16:35.829 --> 16:41.607
Governor, your only hope for
survival is a heart transplant.

16:41.759 --> 16:44.243
CONRAD:
Your heart was weak
to begin with.

16:44.395 --> 16:46.504
And now you're in heart failure.

16:46.655 --> 16:49.081
The meds you're getting
from that big IV in your chest

16:49.234 --> 16:50.566
are the only reason your heart

16:50.568 --> 16:52.568
is beating strong enough
to keep you alive.

16:52.587 --> 16:54.328
The only way you get
on the other side of this

16:54.347 --> 16:56.072
is with a new heart.

16:56.090 --> 16:57.240
We'll get you listed with UNOS,

16:57.258 --> 16:58.516
the organ-sharing network,

16:58.743 --> 17:00.184
but that's just the start
of the process.

17:00.411 --> 17:01.744
Unfortunately you're sick enough
to need a new heart

17:01.837 --> 17:03.929
but not sick enough
to be at the top of the list.

17:04.082 --> 17:05.081
You're gonna have to wait.

17:05.099 --> 17:06.190
How long?

17:06.342 --> 17:09.193
Months, maybe longer.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.011
What do I do all that time?
Wither away?

17:11.105 --> 17:12.196
AUSTIN:
Well, there are options.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.924
We can get you out of here
with a VAD.

17:15.017 --> 17:17.943
-Now, a VAD is...
-Yeah, yeah, I know
what a VAD is.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.520
My dad had one.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.540
Plugging it into
a wall socket at night.

17:22.691 --> 17:23.616
Barely able to shower.

17:23.768 --> 17:24.600
It is an adjustment.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.952
Yeah, but-but it
is not happening.

17:28.030 --> 17:32.275
I am getting a new heart
and I'm not waiting.

17:32.293 --> 17:34.368
I'm the governor,
for God's sake!

17:34.387 --> 17:38.038
If you won't get me to the top
of the transplant list,

17:38.132 --> 17:39.599
another hospital will.

17:47.642 --> 17:48.641
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:48.793 --> 17:50.068
Welcome back. We missed you.

17:50.295 --> 17:51.644
Yeah, thanks, good to be missed.

17:51.796 --> 17:54.113
-You got a minute?
-Yeah.

17:55.316 --> 17:56.574
How's your immunotherapy work
progressing?

17:56.801 --> 17:57.742
If you mean the MS trial...

17:57.893 --> 17:59.560
-Yeah.
-the phase one results

17:59.579 --> 18:01.913
weren't conclusive but
promising enough where I'm still

18:02.140 --> 18:05.641
a believer that targeting
the EBV-infected cells

18:05.660 --> 18:07.418
is gonna have good results.

18:07.645 --> 18:09.069
But how about phase two?

18:09.163 --> 18:11.480
Clinically, we're ready
to launch, but as you know,

18:11.499 --> 18:15.093
we don't have the money yet.
We're barely 50% funded.

18:15.244 --> 18:16.836
You know, I'm working on it.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.055
(sighs) Okay, then.

18:20.491 --> 18:22.058
Well, how are you holding up?

18:23.161 --> 18:26.011
Uh, yesterday wasn't bad.

18:26.164 --> 18:27.588
Today's good.

18:27.682 --> 18:29.832
Tomorrow, I don't...

18:29.925 --> 18:31.000
I'm...

18:31.002 --> 18:32.518
(sighs)

18:32.670 --> 18:35.171
I'm just trying to make
some smart choices about

18:35.189 --> 18:37.506
my treatment moving forward.

18:37.600 --> 18:41.101
But-but I feel...
I-I feel good today.

18:41.270 --> 18:44.705
So... And I'm glad to be back.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.463
♪ ♪

19:21.719 --> 19:22.735
Thanks for the assist.

19:22.811 --> 19:24.144
No problem.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.555
Those parents seem wrecked.

19:26.649 --> 19:28.958
Can't imagine.

19:31.562 --> 19:33.153
The primary issue
is doing the craniotomy

19:33.247 --> 19:34.730
and trying to reduce
the swelling.

19:34.749 --> 19:36.323
But after the kind
of accident she had,

19:36.401 --> 19:37.791
there could be surprises.

19:37.919 --> 19:39.093
Of course.

19:41.163 --> 19:42.738
To be honest, based on the CT,

19:42.907 --> 19:47.910
this surgery is a Hail Mary.
But we have to try.

19:47.929 --> 19:50.104
(scrubbing)

19:51.006 --> 19:53.340
(saw screeching)

19:53.434 --> 19:55.359
BILLIE:
Okay.

19:57.104 --> 19:59.179
LEELA:
Removing the skull cap.

19:59.273 --> 20:02.325
BILLIE:
This should relieve
the pressure.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.852
All right, brain looks good.
Pulsatile.

20:05.947 --> 20:08.280
Wouldn't it be cool
to fly a helicopter?

20:08.433 --> 20:09.707
Choppers terrify me.

20:09.934 --> 20:12.210
But if this goes well, maybe
Thea will give you a lesson.

20:12.361 --> 20:14.462
-(Leela chuckles)
-(monitors beeping)

20:15.606 --> 20:17.197
She's hypertensive
and bradycardic.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.608
Pressure must be building again.

20:19.627 --> 20:21.126
Her brain is herniating
out of her skull.

20:21.279 --> 20:22.945
BILLIE:
Could be a seizure.

20:22.964 --> 20:24.055
Or fluid overload.

20:24.206 --> 20:25.798
Let's give her
more mannitol, stat.

20:25.950 --> 20:28.300
Re-dose furosemide and get
the head of the bed up higher.

20:28.453 --> 20:30.469
(beeping)

20:30.563 --> 20:32.396
Oh, she's getting worse.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.735
What am I not seeing?

20:41.132 --> 20:42.815
It's something we can't see.

20:42.967 --> 20:44.408
-A bleed?
-On the other side of the brain.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.077
I couldn't see it in CT
because of the swelling.

20:46.304 --> 20:47.303
LEELA:
When the brain was decompressed,

20:47.321 --> 20:48.913
the bleed had room to expand.

-Thanks.

I have some explaining to do.

unable to transfer you

25:55.279 --> 25:56.461
due to lack of beds.

25:56.614 --> 25:59.615
You know, all the ICUs
around town are full

25:59.617 --> 26:02.059
because of the patients
we have to transfer

26:02.286 --> 26:04.377
due to budget cuts?

26:04.471 --> 26:06.713
That's correct.

Okay, let's hear it.

26:20.304 --> 26:23.989
I am willing to save
this hospital.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.917
Restore the money
that's been cut.

26:27.069 --> 26:29.044
From my discretionary fund.

26:30.238 --> 26:32.047
Out of gratitude.

26:34.001 --> 26:35.426
Gratitude.

to move me to the top
of the UNOS list.

26:55.356 --> 26:59.992
But in exchange you are
offering to save Chastain?

27:01.362 --> 27:02.678
Correct.

27:02.771 --> 27:05.848
So what'll it take...

27:05.866 --> 27:09.668

27:13.799 --> 27:16.875
An intra-aortic balloon pump.

27:17.862 --> 27:21.713
We take a catheter and we insert
a small balloon in your aorta.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.683
And it helps
your heart function.

27:25.719 --> 27:27.394
Okay.

27:28.797 --> 27:29.705
Are there risks?

27:29.723 --> 27:31.223
Of course there are risks.

27:31.317 --> 27:35.653
The balloon could rupture,
causing damage to your aorta.

27:35.804 --> 27:38.489
Your platelet count might fall,
which means you could bleed out.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.399
But you've done this?

27:40.493 --> 27:44.370
Plenty of times when it
was called for medically.

27:45.147 --> 27:46.071
And afterwards?

27:46.148 --> 27:48.540
I'll be high on the list?

27:50.244 --> 27:52.127

Believe me, we are conflicted.

33:18.646 --> 33:20.146
This wasn't just about Betz.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.239
JAMES:
Actually, you know what?

33:21.391 --> 33:24.059
Uh, I don't want to know.

33:24.152 --> 33:26.003
Attaching the pump console.

33:27.564 --> 33:28.714
Initiate pumping.

33:33.086 --> 33:35.679
AUSTIN:
All good. For now.

33:35.830 --> 33:39.349
I'll notify UNOS
where Betz stands.

33:40.168 --> 33:42.502
Conrad, I need your help.

33:42.596 --> 33:44.187
It's Thea, the pilot.

33:51.104 --> 33:54.105
I thought the surgery went
well, but I'm having trouble

33:54.199 --> 33:55.607
keeping her O2 sats up.

33:55.759 --> 33:57.776
If she dies of hypoxia,

33:57.928 --> 33:59.778
then nothing I did
in surgery is gonna matter.

33:59.930 --> 34:02.522
All right, well,
we'll figure this out.

34:02.616 --> 34:05.125
(pager beeping)

34:06.119 --> 34:07.586
It's the ICU.

34:11.775 --> 34:14.760
(monitor alert beeping)

34:17.464 --> 34:19.464
I can't get her sats above 85

34:19.616 --> 34:21.091
and her peak pressures
are rising.

34:21.285 --> 34:23.060
Bilateral breath sounds?
She did have the rib fractures.

34:23.287 --> 34:24.452
Pneumothorax was
my first thought too,

34:24.621 --> 34:26.304
but she has lung sliding
on her ultrasound.

34:26.456 --> 34:28.473
Okay, so no pneumo. Let's get
a portable chest X-ray.

34:28.625 --> 34:30.216
I called them twice,
they're short-staffed.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.218
But her chest imaging
post-intubation was clear.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.220
-She has no history of asthma.
-And her resistance isn't high.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.656
But her plateau is.

34:39.060 --> 34:40.135
This is ARDS.

34:40.304 --> 34:41.636
Damn, you're right.

34:41.655 --> 34:43.729
Maybe she had an aspiration
event on her way to CT?

34:43.824 --> 34:45.307
Leading to inflammation
and ARDS.

34:45.325 --> 34:47.659
So we start low tidal
volume ventilation.

34:47.811 --> 34:49.086
And we go up on the PEEP now.

34:49.237 --> 34:50.495
But, Billie, this means...

34:50.647 --> 34:51.996
I know. Deep sedation
and paralytics.

34:52.149 --> 34:55.300
We will not be able
to monitor her neuro status.

34:56.095 --> 34:57.260
If we can't get her sats up,

34:57.412 --> 34:59.912
there'll be no neuro status
to monitor.

35:00.006 --> 35:02.099
Let's do it.

35:13.261 --> 35:15.687
KIT:
I just got off the phone
with UNOS.

35:15.839 --> 35:17.930
Governor Betz has been moved
to the top of the list

35:18.024 --> 35:19.199
for a heart transplant.

35:22.604 --> 35:24.788
I'd like an explanation.

35:24.939 --> 35:28.032
Well, we performed a balloon
pump procedure on the governor

35:28.201 --> 35:30.443
to assist
with his cardiac functioning.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.355
A procedure
he did not actually need

35:33.448 --> 35:35.206
but conveniently moved
him up the list.

35:35.359 --> 35:37.551
Yeah, well,
we don't make the rules.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.287
I agree with the decision.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.724
And the procedure
was successful.

35:45.719 --> 35:47.886
Do you know what this means?

35:47.980 --> 35:50.038
The pilot who may be
about to die

35:50.056 --> 35:52.482
because Betz made her fly
in unsafe conditions,

35:52.634 --> 35:54.467
could end up
giving him her heart.

35:54.561 --> 35:56.227
Thea is still hanging on
in the ICU.

35:56.396 --> 35:57.395
We're not giving up on her.

35:57.547 --> 35:59.381
And the procedure
on the governor

35:59.399 --> 36:01.974
was part of a compromise
that will benefit us all.

36:01.994 --> 36:03.551
And how would that be?

36:03.570 --> 36:06.905
Betz agreed to unlock the money
we need to save Chastain.

36:07.057 --> 36:08.665
(Bell scoffs)

36:09.910 --> 36:13.837
He's going to restore the money
from his discretionary fund?

36:14.064 --> 36:15.154
If he gets a heart.

36:15.174 --> 36:17.132
And survives the transplant.

36:21.254 --> 36:25.140
You'd better move heaven
and earth to keep Thea alive.

36:34.751 --> 36:36.601
You're still here?

36:36.753 --> 36:41.272
Yeah. Didn't want to leave yet.

36:41.441 --> 36:43.758
Me, too.

36:43.777 --> 36:44.926
Any sign?

36:44.945 --> 36:47.078
No.

36:51.768 --> 36:54.544

37:15.883 --> 37:19.527

I couldn't help anyone anymore.

37:23.483 --> 37:26.392
Not sure why I pinned
my hopes on Thea.

37:27.804 --> 37:31.081
It's hard to predict which
patients we'll get attached to.

37:34.311 --> 37:39.256
But, you know, a lady chopper
pilot is pretty badass.
