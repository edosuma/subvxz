WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:05.831
<i>- Dwayne Johnson</i>
<i>is just a bad guy.</i>

00:05.875 --> 00:07.224
<i>He always has been.</i>

00:07.268 --> 00:08.660
<i>And when someone tries</i>
<i>to kill you,</i>

00:08.704 --> 00:10.097
you don't forget.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.447
And you don't want that person
in the White House.

00:12.490 --> 00:15.145
- Wait, so you do know
this guy?

00:15.189 --> 00:16.668
We met briefly in Hawaii.

00:16.712 --> 00:17.887
- Did you really try
and kill him?

00:17.930 --> 00:19.584
- No.
Come on, of course not.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.847
- Well, so who is he?
What happened?

00:21.891 --> 00:23.632
- You know when you're on top,
somebody will come along

00:23.675 --> 00:25.068
and try to knock you down
a peg?

00:25.112 --> 00:26.678
- Oh, yes.

00:29.551 --> 00:32.336
- In 1984, my dad,
Rocky Johnson,

00:32.380 --> 00:33.685
and his tag team partner
Tony Atlas

00:33.729 --> 00:36.079
had just won
the WWE Tag Team titles

00:36.123 --> 00:37.733
and we were all riding high.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.778
<i>My dad was making more money</i>

00:39.822 --> 00:41.476
<i>than he'd ever made</i>
<i>in his life.</i>

00:41.519 --> 00:43.434
<i>And one of the first things</i>
<i>he did was call the guy</i>

00:43.478 --> 00:45.262
<i>all the wrestlers</i>
<i>got their jewelry from,</i>

00:45.306 --> 00:46.916
<i>legendary heel manager,</i>

00:46.959 --> 00:48.352
<i>Classy Freddie Blassie.</i>

00:48.396 --> 00:52.269
- The finest Israeli diamonds
in Hawaii.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.709
<i>- And one of the first things</i>
<i>I did was go on</i>

00:57.753 --> 00:59.537
<i>a shopping spree</i>
<i>at Toys "R" Us.</i>

00:59.581 --> 01:01.626
<i>Vince McMahon had made my dad</i>
<i>a star,</i>

01:01.670 --> 01:03.541
<i>and he wasn't only making</i>
<i>our lives better,</i>

01:03.585 --> 01:05.021
<i>he had my grandmother's back</i>

01:05.065 --> 01:07.806
<i>as she dealt with federal</i>
<i>charges for an incident</i>

01:07.850 --> 01:10.070
<i>involving rival promoter</i>
<i>Greg Yao.</i>

01:10.113 --> 01:11.549
It's a screw job, Vince.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.029
- Whatever we can do
to support you, Lia,

01:13.073 --> 01:14.248
just let me know.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.684
These feds,
they don't understand

01:15.727 --> 01:17.164
the ways of our business.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.817
- You know they're listening
to this call right now.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.384
- No way.
They'd have to get their heads

01:20.428 --> 01:22.212
out of their asses first.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.303
Good.

01:26.347 --> 01:27.696
<i>- Vince was always true</i>
<i>to his word</i>

01:27.739 --> 01:29.219
<i>and continued to allow</i>
<i>some of his guys</i>

01:29.263 --> 01:30.829
<i>to work for my grandmother,</i>

01:30.873 --> 01:32.701
<i>which was crucial</i>
<i>to her business.</i>

01:32.744 --> 01:35.878
<i>His WWF stars wrestled</i>
<i>on her weekly show,</i>

01:35.921 --> 01:38.750
<i>which aired on TV in Hawaii</i>
<i>every Saturday.</i>

01:38.794 --> 01:41.318
<i>- Mr. Fuji throws salt</i>
<i>on King Tonga's eyes!</i>

01:41.362 --> 01:43.581
<i>That's gotta sting!</i>

01:43.625 --> 01:46.106
<i>Wait a minute,</i>
<i>Jake's pointing at his bag.</i>

01:46.149 --> 01:47.629
<i>What's in the bag?</i>

01:47.672 --> 01:49.587
<i>Oh, my God, it's Desdemona!</i>

01:49.631 --> 01:51.589
<i>Jake places his snake,</i>
<i>Desdemona,</i>

01:51.633 --> 01:53.765
<i>on a knocked-out</i>
<i>Slaughter's chest,</i>

01:53.809 --> 01:55.115
<i>adding insult to injury.</i>

01:57.204 --> 01:58.596
<i>Rocky with the elbow to Sheik.</i>

01:58.640 --> 02:01.164
<i>And George "The Animal" Steele</i>
<i>is going wild.</i>

02:01.208 --> 02:02.948
<i>Rocky dives for the tag.</i>

02:02.992 --> 02:05.908
<i>Tony Atlas is coming in</i>
<i>like a house on fire.</i>

02:05.951 --> 02:08.563
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

02:08.606 --> 02:11.740
<i>- He body-presses Sheik!</i>
<i>What a specimen!</i>

02:14.395 --> 02:16.919
One, two, three.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.529
<i>- The Soul Patrol</i>
<i>has done it again.</i>

02:18.573 --> 02:21.097
- Ooh!
- Yeah! Go Dad!

02:21.141 --> 02:23.186
Wait, these aren't
potato ridges.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.448
They're Ruffles, baby.

02:24.492 --> 02:27.277
Only name brand for us now.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.845
- both: Whoo!
- Wow!

02:29.888 --> 02:31.020
<i>Things were great.</i>

02:31.063 --> 02:32.500
<i>We were living</i>
<i>in a nice apartment</i>

02:32.543 --> 02:34.371
<i>eating name-brand snacks.</i>

02:34.415 --> 02:35.807
<i>And the clothes...</i>

02:44.207 --> 02:45.556
<i>I felt pretty damn cool</i>

02:45.600 --> 02:48.211
<i>being the son</i>
<i>of a WWF champ.</i>

02:48.255 --> 02:50.082
- Hey,
how much can your dad bench?

02:50.126 --> 02:51.519
I don't know, but it's a lot.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.999
One time, I saw him pick up
a refrigerator.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.349
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

02:55.392 --> 02:56.872
- I saw Rocky pull a knife
on a bunch of kids

02:56.915 --> 02:59.004
who had stolen
Dewey's boogie board.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.789
all: Whoa.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.530
- And then my dad grabs Steele

03:02.573 --> 03:04.314
by his back hair.
all: Whoa.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.489
So Sheik jumps in.

03:05.533 --> 03:08.100
Then my dad starts
pummeling Sheik.

03:08.144 --> 03:12.192
My dad tags in Tony who pins
Sheik and the announcers go,

03:12.235 --> 03:15.195
"The Soul Patrol
has done it again!"

03:15.238 --> 03:16.196
all: Whoa.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.110
Sorry.

03:18.154 --> 03:19.808
Julien here. New kid.

03:19.851 --> 03:22.332
My family just moved in
from St. Paul, Minnesota.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.335
- Oh, my God.
- That's him.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.554
- Julien.
- That's him.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.599
And he came out of the gates
swingin'.

03:28.643 --> 03:32.255
- How do we know that Rocky
Johnson is really your dad?

03:32.299 --> 03:34.257
- What?
- I'm just saying.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.216
Have any of you
ever seen Rocky?

03:36.259 --> 03:38.870
- Yeah.

03:38.914 --> 03:41.046
- Sebi, you just said
you saw my dad

03:41.090 --> 03:42.526
pull a knife on some bullies.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.180
- Well, now that I think
about it,

03:44.224 --> 03:46.704
it could have just been
a supportive man you were with.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.620
- Has your dad ever
dropped you off at school?

03:49.664 --> 03:51.492
No, 'cause I take the bus.

03:51.535 --> 03:55.235
- That's weird.
Son of a champ takes the bus.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.975
Just saying.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.934
<i>- No one had ever</i>
<i>challenged me like that,</i>

03:58.977 --> 04:00.501
<i>and it got to me.</i>

04:00.544 --> 04:02.111
<i>- So the Rainbow Warriors</i>
<i>certainly have their work</i>

04:02.154 --> 04:03.634
<i>cut out for them.</i>

04:03.678 --> 04:05.070
<i>- Coming up</i>
<i>on "Terry and the Chief,"</i>

04:05.114 --> 04:06.811
<i>Lia Maivia, in-studio live.</i>

04:06.855 --> 04:08.726
Lia,
the whole island is buzzing

04:08.770 --> 04:11.033
about the live wrestling event
you're putting on next month.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.904
Can you give us any details?

04:12.948 --> 04:14.384
Of course, Terry.

04:14.428 --> 04:17.605
The Backyard Brawl-B-Q
will be held at Aloha Stadium

04:17.648 --> 04:19.824
with the biggest stars
in the business:

04:19.868 --> 04:23.437
André the Giant, Soul Patrol,
Ric Flair,

04:23.480 --> 04:26.135
Roddy Piper, Jake "The Snake."

04:26.178 --> 04:27.702
Oh, and so many more--

04:27.745 --> 04:30.270
- Mrs. Maivia,
you can't be here.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.402
Again,
you are under house arrest.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.361
- How did you find me?
- You're on the radio.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.363
- Let's go.
- But this is for my business.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.973
- You're about to go on trial
for racketeering

04:38.016 --> 04:39.757
and extortion charges
against Greg Yao.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.759
You're not to conduct business
of any kind.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.674
- Fine,
I'll call my white lawyer

04:43.718 --> 04:45.110
and see what he says
about that.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.329
Yes. Great.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.461
I very much encourage you
to do so.

04:47.504 --> 04:48.766
Good. I will.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.162
Tickets are going fast.
Call 808--

04:53.205 --> 04:54.859
Mrs. Maivia!

04:54.903 --> 04:56.731
- 157-8922!

04:58.210 --> 04:58.385
.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.778
- The FBI can be ruthless,
as I know from researching

05:00.822 --> 05:02.389
the role of Elliot Ness,

05:02.432 --> 05:04.608
which I didn't wind up getting
because the casting director

05:04.652 --> 05:06.131
- was playing mind games.
- Mm.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.959
- So you know then.
- Mm-hmm.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.570
- You know, like I was saying,
when you're on top

05:09.613 --> 05:12.094
like my grandmother was,
people come for you, man.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.661
- Hmm.
- When she was getting ready

05:13.704 --> 05:15.315
for her court case,
my dad and Tony,

05:15.358 --> 05:16.751
well,
they were really embracing

05:16.794 --> 05:18.274
the perks of being champs.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.407
- The number one rule
is no matter what,

05:20.450 --> 05:23.758
under any circumstances,
never, ever

05:23.801 --> 05:25.890
feed them after midnight. Yeah.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.110
Hey, nice necklace, Rock.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.938
What is that, a bronze coyote?

05:29.981 --> 05:32.114
- Oh, no, brother.
It's a golden lion.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.768
Yes, it is.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.553
You live your life, brother.
I just got myself a waterbed.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.338
- Hey, I heard that's like
sleeping in the ocean.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.775
- I wouldn't know.
See, I don't go near the ocean.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.038
But I do mess with a waterbed.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.432
The guy even gave me
a champion's discount.

05:45.475 --> 05:48.391
King Titan's Luxury Goods,
they'll hook you up.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.219
- André.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.177
all: Hey.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.701
Hey, good to see you.

05:53.744 --> 05:54.963
Pat Patterson.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.142
Ah, Rocky.

06:00.185 --> 06:02.013
Guess who was just talking
about you?

06:02.057 --> 06:04.494
- Who?
- Nobody!

06:06.366 --> 06:08.542
- "Nobody!"

06:08.585 --> 06:10.457
Ah, Pat loved that joke.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.981
You know, he was tag team
partners with my grandfather,

06:13.024 --> 06:14.461
High Chief Peter Maivia.

06:14.504 --> 06:17.115
And Pat was the first
openly gay wrestler.

06:17.159 --> 06:19.596
And at that time in pro
wrestling, it wasn't easy.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.903
<i>They would mess with him</i>
<i>and talk behind his back.</i>

06:21.946 --> 06:23.470
- Look at his jacket.

06:23.513 --> 06:24.819
<i>- So my grandfather</i>
<i>went up to Pat</i>

06:24.862 --> 06:26.734
<i>in a crowded locker room...</i>

06:26.777 --> 06:28.213
Good luck tonight, Pat.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.347
<i>- That was my grandfather's</i>
<i>way of saying,</i>

06:31.391 --> 06:33.436
<i>"If you mess with Pat,</i>
<i>then you mess with me."</i>

06:33.480 --> 06:34.742
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

06:34.785 --> 06:36.308
- No one wanted to mess
with the High Chief.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.746
He was the baddest dude
in the room.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.575
Bobby.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.231
- I have an important
announcement from Lia.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.278
<i>- Testing, testing.</i>
<i>One, two, three.</i>

06:49.321 --> 06:51.149
<i>Bob, are you recording?</i>

06:51.193 --> 06:52.586
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Good.</i>

06:52.629 --> 06:55.240
<i>Hello. I wish I could be</i>
<i>with you in person today,</i>

06:55.284 --> 06:56.981
<i>but my white lawyer has said</i>

06:57.025 --> 06:59.462
<i>I can't conduct</i>
<i>any wrestling business.</i>

06:59.506 --> 07:01.508
<i>I will sort this out,</i>
<i>but until then,</i>

07:01.551 --> 07:03.727
<i>I won't be able</i>
<i>to run any meetings.</i>

07:03.771 --> 07:06.034
<i>And I'll be in touch soon.</i>
<i>How do I turn--</i>

07:06.077 --> 07:08.079
Uh, these used pancakes

07:08.123 --> 07:10.734
are from the gentleman
in the corner booth.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.476
Enjoy the leftovers, boys.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.391
Didn't want them
to go to waste.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.480
- Greg Yao.
What are you doing here?

07:17.524 --> 07:19.395
- I've been up for three days
celebrating.

07:20.744 --> 07:23.878
Celebrating.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.967
Wait,
what was I celebrating again?

07:26.010 --> 07:27.534
- You know what,
you wouldn't have the balls

07:27.577 --> 07:29.840
to show up in this diner
if Lia were here.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.886
- Well, she's not here.
But I am.

07:31.929 --> 07:34.497
With Jessica and Kristen.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.673
- It--it's Kir-sten.

07:36.717 --> 07:39.633
- I'm never gonna remember
that, baby.

07:39.676 --> 07:42.200
Wait, celebrating
your family's demise!

07:42.244 --> 07:43.550
That's what I was gonna say.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.595
That's what I've been up
for three days doing.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.296
<i>- While my grandmother had</i>
<i>her hands full with Greg Yao,</i>

07:51.340 --> 07:52.863
<i>I was dealing</i>
<i>with my own problem.</i>

07:52.907 --> 07:55.475
Dad, can you sign this for me?

07:55.518 --> 07:56.998
Sure.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.434
- What's that for?
- There's a kid at school

07:58.478 --> 08:00.958
who doesn't believe that Dad
is my dad.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.394
- What?
Of course I'm your dad.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.440
- I know,
but he doesn't believe me.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.747
- Oh, honey,
don't let that kid bother you.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.575
But get used to it.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.795
You see, I'm on top,
which means you're on top.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.797
Naturally, people are gonna
wanna challenge you.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.669
Here, hand it over like this.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.105
So they can see
the family resemblance.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.802
- Hi.

08:18.846 --> 08:21.283
How you folks doing?
Anything catch your eye so far?

08:21.326 --> 08:23.285
- Yes, uh--

08:23.328 --> 08:26.288
We are interested
in a waterbed.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.812
My tag team partner,
Tony Atlas,

08:28.856 --> 08:30.597
said he got one here.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.946
Rocky Johnson.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.600
Wow,
I'm a huge "Soul Patrol" fan.

08:33.643 --> 08:36.211
- Oh, thank you.
- That last match was awesome.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.213
When Tony press-slammed
the Sheik.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.215
- Yeah.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.130
But I kind of roughed Sheik up
before that.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.566
- Set Tony up.
- Yeah. Ingrid?

08:43.610 --> 08:45.437
Let's get
a "Champion's Discount"

08:45.481 --> 08:47.788
for Mr. Atlas' partner here.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.703
- Okay.
I love Tony Atlas.

08:51.661 --> 08:54.751
- Yo, Julien, you want proof
that Rocky Johnson's my dad?

08:54.795 --> 08:57.232
Here.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.103
- That's a cute photo
that you could've gotten

08:59.147 --> 09:00.496
at a meet-and-greet.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.543
You see,
I also have a signed photo

09:03.586 --> 09:05.153
with me and Rocky.

09:05.196 --> 09:07.503
- Does this mean he's my dad?

09:07.547 --> 09:08.765
No.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.812
I also have one with me
and Johnny Carson.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.161
kids: Whoa!

09:13.204 --> 09:15.598
Also not my dad.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.385
<i>- Oh, ho, so Julien was</i>
<i>that kind of kid.</i>

09:20.429 --> 09:22.170
- The worst, right?
- The worst.

09:22.213 --> 09:23.824
I totally get why you tried
to kill him.

09:23.867 --> 09:24.999
I never tried to kill him.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.000
- Oh, right.
Right.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.002
- Like at all.
- Okay.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.307
<i>- I'll be--I'll be right out.</i>

09:31.701 --> 09:33.268
<i>- Hope.</i>

09:33.311 --> 09:34.617
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

09:34.661 --> 09:36.619
<i>- I'm here</i>
<i>to take the woman I love.</i>

09:36.663 --> 09:37.489
<i>My woman.</i>

09:37.533 --> 09:38.882
I prayed for this moment.

09:38.926 --> 09:39.927
Bo still loves Hope!

09:43.452 --> 09:44.627
Honey.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.499
I need you
to take over the business.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.501
- What?
- Just temporarily.

09:49.545 --> 09:53.288
The slimy FBI put a ankle ring
on me to track me like a dog,

09:53.331 --> 09:55.377
so I can't work
while my court case is pending.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.552
- Have you talked
to Herman about this?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.206
- Who?
- Your white lawyer.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.642
- Yes, yes.
He agrees.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.470
While I'm dealing
with the trial,

10:01.513 --> 10:04.255
I need you to make sure
everything runs smoothly.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.606
If anything jeopardizes
this business,

10:06.649 --> 10:07.911
Greg Yao wins.

10:07.955 --> 10:08.869
- But--
- Hold on.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.435
"Days" is back.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.872
<i>- You're not</i>
<i>gonna marry Welch.</i>

10:11.915 --> 10:13.787
- <i>I'm not gonna let that happen.</i>
<i>- Stop me.</i>

10:17.486 --> 10:18.705
I knew he'd stop the wedding.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.663
- Maybe Rocky should get
a motorcycle.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.710
- Running the business
will be easy.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.799
You oversee
the Saturday matches

10:25.842 --> 10:28.323
and the Backyard Brawl-B-Q
live event.

10:28.366 --> 10:29.672
- But I've never done anything
like this.

10:29.716 --> 10:30.891
I can't just come in
and run the--

10:30.934 --> 10:32.327
Yes, you can.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.895
You've been by my side
the whole time.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.288
The business is in your blood.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.725
That's true.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.641
I have watched you and dad
do this my entire life.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.209
Okay.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.602
I'll do it.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.691
- Good.
And remember.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.432
When the wrestlers come
and tell you ideas

10:50.475 --> 10:51.607
about their persona,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.914
just say,
"I'll think about it."

10:53.957 --> 10:56.786
And then never think about it.

10:59.789 --> 11:00.007
.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.749
- My mom gave me the breakdown
of this Saturday's matches

11:02.792 --> 11:03.967
and they're basically the same
as last week's.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.404
- Hey,
it's a well-oiled machine.

11:06.448 --> 11:08.363
You got this, babe.
You're gonna do great.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.802
- I'm talking Pan-Am, right?

11:12.846 --> 11:14.151
You gotta get in there.
I'm on that Nasdaq--

11:14.195 --> 11:15.587
- Okay, everyone,
let's all take a seat

11:15.631 --> 11:16.893
and get started.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.854
Sheik, are you looking
for the bathroom?

11:20.897 --> 11:23.204
- No.
I'm giving myself a tour.

11:23.247 --> 11:25.075
- Let's just all stay
in the living room.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.424
- Hey, man,
pass this coffee to Randy?

11:26.468 --> 11:27.425
Yeah, got you, brother.

11:27.469 --> 11:28.731
Yeah.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.777
That's for you.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.387
Ooh, yeah.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.518
Great coffee, Tone.

11:33.562 --> 11:34.737
Welcome, boss.

11:34.781 --> 11:35.912
Hey.

11:35.956 --> 11:37.435
I made that coffee, man.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.394
Sorry, brother.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.135
- It's nice.
- Thank you.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.832
Was that so hard?

11:42.876 --> 11:44.747
Okay, let's get to business.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.228
Um, as you know,
I'm temporarily taking over

11:47.271 --> 11:49.926
for my mom while
she handles her legal issues.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.754
Uh, so let's go through
Saturday's match.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.451
- Ata?
- Yes, Sika?

11:53.495 --> 11:56.541
- I've an idea I wanna try
called "Touched by a Ghost."

11:57.760 --> 11:59.719
See, I dye my hair all white.

11:59.762 --> 12:03.113
Either I'm a ghost
or I'm a warrior

12:03.157 --> 12:06.813
who fought ghosts and survived,
but I paid a price.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.466
My white hair.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.816
I always carry the mark.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.556
- That's deep.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.384
- Okay, well, maybe--

12:13.428 --> 12:14.385
And I was also thinking,

12:14.429 --> 12:16.126
I know I'm super strong
and all,

12:16.170 --> 12:18.563
but what if I had a weakness,

12:18.607 --> 12:20.827
and that weakness was feet?

12:20.870 --> 12:22.132
- Women's feet!
- You know what, Tony?

12:22.176 --> 12:23.655
- I thi--
- What if I ate some bad beans

12:23.699 --> 12:24.787
and magically become smart?

12:26.267 --> 12:27.398
You know what?

12:27.442 --> 12:28.965
These are great ideas.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.445
How 'bout
we all write them down

12:30.488 --> 12:31.576
and I'll think about it?

12:31.620 --> 12:33.187
- I--
- Bob has pens and paper.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.972
- I write them--

12:36.016 --> 12:37.104
I'm already taking notes.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.323
Um, hey,
that's my pad, okay?

12:39.367 --> 12:41.586
That has a personal message
from a lady on it, okay?

12:41.630 --> 12:42.979
That's a note from my mother.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.546
Please, that's from my mother!

12:45.895 --> 12:47.157
Just ignore him, baby.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.507
It doesn't matter
what this Julien kid thinks.

12:49.551 --> 12:50.987
Except it does.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.163
Kids are starting
to believe him.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.512
- Well, fine,
then I'll just come to school

12:54.556 --> 12:56.253
with you tomorrow
and show him my stretch marks.

12:56.297 --> 12:57.820
- Uh, you know what?

12:57.864 --> 12:58.995
I think I'm good.

12:59.039 --> 13:00.823
<i>- Mr. Fuji.</i>

13:00.867 --> 13:02.999
<i>Again with the salt</i>
<i>to the eyes.</i>

13:03.043 --> 13:04.435
<i>- Look who's back.</i>

13:04.479 --> 13:06.220
<i>It's Desdemona!</i>

13:06.263 --> 13:08.483
<i>Jake "The Snake" adds insult</i>
<i>to injury.</i>

13:08.526 --> 13:10.354
<i>- Now that my mom</i>
<i>was in charge,</i>

13:10.398 --> 13:13.357
<i>she saw the wrestling matches</i>
<i>in a new light.</i>

13:13.401 --> 13:15.925
<i>And all she could think about</i>
<i>were ways to improve them.</i>

13:15.969 --> 13:18.145
<i>- He body-presses Valentine!</i>

13:18.188 --> 13:20.321
<i>His signature move.</i>

13:22.540 --> 13:23.846
- <i>Tony pins Greg Valentine.</i>
- Yeah!

13:23.890 --> 13:25.195
<i>- And the Soul Patrol</i>
<i>wins again.</i>

13:25.239 --> 13:27.850
Dad!

13:27.894 --> 13:29.373
- Ata.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.071
- Pat!
- It's so good to see you.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.333
- Oh.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.423
So good to see you.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.903
You remember my son, Dewey?

13:36.946 --> 13:39.035
Oh, look at this little man.

13:39.079 --> 13:41.864
He reminds me so much of Peter.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.084
One day, you will be a champ.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.477
Huh?
Like your father.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.175
And your grandfather, hmm?

13:48.218 --> 13:50.307
It is in your blood.
You understand?

13:50.351 --> 13:52.832
<i>- Pat was right.</i>
<i>It was in my blood.</i>

13:52.875 --> 13:54.572
<i>And I knew</i>
<i>what I needed to do.</i>

13:55.791 --> 13:57.532
<i>And so did my mom.</i>

13:57.575 --> 13:59.403
- Why are you looking
at the guys' suggestions?

13:59.447 --> 14:01.797
You're not actually
considering their ideas?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.799
Their ideas aren't great.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.497
But they're not wrong to want
to do something different.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.673
Doesn't it feel like we keep
repeating the same thing?

14:08.717 --> 14:09.892
I feel like I am.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.415
Babe, I do all that selling.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.243
Tony gets the hot tag
and the big finish.

14:13.287 --> 14:14.897
And that's what the people
remember.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.377
It's crazy.

14:16.420 --> 14:19.467
I do 99% of the work
and he gets all the glory.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.599
I mean,
we're both tag team champ--

14:25.429 --> 14:26.909
Where's my belt?

14:28.084 --> 14:29.520
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

14:31.261 --> 14:33.220
Whoa.

14:33.263 --> 14:36.788
- Is that the WWF
Tag Team belt?

14:36.832 --> 14:39.008
- Yep.
Yo, Julien?

14:39.052 --> 14:41.010
Just thought I'd wear a belt
to school today.

14:41.054 --> 14:43.491
My dad's championship belt.
kids: Whoa.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.841
- Did you also get one of these
at a meet-and-greet?

14:45.885 --> 14:47.364
No.

14:47.408 --> 14:50.454
- Huh, so how do you think
I got it then?

14:51.803 --> 14:53.936
- I guess Rocky Johnson
really is your dad.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.112
And don't forget it.

14:56.156 --> 14:59.681
- But it's not like
it's your belt.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.117
- Say what?

15:01.161 --> 15:02.466
You didn't win it.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.728
You're not a wrestler.

15:03.772 --> 15:04.991
Not yet.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.340
But I will be.

15:06.383 --> 15:07.515
It's in my blood.

15:07.558 --> 15:08.559
Oh, yeah?

15:09.865 --> 15:12.607
Prove it.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.000
Let's take this to the yard.

15:18.700 --> 15:18.874
.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.920
- Great work
on Saturday's matches.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.878
- I mean,
I just executed your vision.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.488
Exactly.

15:24.532 --> 15:28.275
Here's a breakdown
for next weekend.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.930
And this week you have to do
the "Wrestling Roundup"

15:30.973 --> 15:33.193
on the "Terry
and the Fake Chief Show."

15:33.236 --> 15:35.456
- This is the same
as last week.

15:35.499 --> 15:36.805
And the week before.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.199
- Mr. Fuji's throwing salt again.
- No, see?

15:39.242 --> 15:42.898
He's throwing salt
in Sergeant Slaughter's eyes.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.552
- But why is he throwing salt
at all?

15:44.595 --> 15:45.814
Because he wants to win.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.469
I mean, what's his backstory?

15:48.512 --> 15:50.079
Was he a failed chef?

15:50.123 --> 15:52.429
Did critics say
his food was too bland,

15:52.473 --> 15:54.605
which caused his restaurant
to close,

15:54.649 --> 15:56.912
and now he just carries salt
with him wherever he goes?

15:56.956 --> 16:00.002
- No, he just throws it
because he has it.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.570
- Maybe we could create
more history for these guys.

16:02.613 --> 16:05.529
Get fans even more invested
in the story lines.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.357
It's like "Days of Our Lives."

16:07.401 --> 16:10.143
Every soap character
has a backstory.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.753
A betrayal.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.929
A secret twin.
A hidden love child.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.278
And we eat it up.

16:15.322 --> 16:16.801
We could be doing
the same thing with wrestling.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.542
- Wrestling's never been
more popular.

16:18.586 --> 16:19.587
Why change it?

16:19.630 --> 16:21.023
It's not changing it.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.025
It's just building
on what's already there.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.548
I really think we've got
a chance to--

16:24.592 --> 16:28.552
- You know what?
I'll think about it.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.119
<i>- Fresh-brewed coffee</i>

16:30.163 --> 16:32.295
<i>will brighten up your day.</i>
<i>Start your morning with a...</i>

16:38.998 --> 16:41.913
- All right, this is
the classic ladder match.

16:41.957 --> 16:44.046
First person
to climb up the ladder

16:44.090 --> 16:46.048
and get the belt wins!

16:47.136 --> 16:48.920
Which will be me.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.662
This is the wrestling ring.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.316
We can't go outside
these lines.

16:53.360 --> 16:57.059
Nothing to the face or nuts
for obvious reasons.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.192
Here, read this.

16:59.235 --> 17:02.891
- In this corner,
weighing in at 91 1/2 pounds,

17:02.934 --> 17:05.981
future wrestler and undisputed
son of Rocky Johnson,

17:06.025 --> 17:09.593
Dewey Douglas Johnson!

17:09.637 --> 17:12.379
- And in the other corner,
Montana Julien.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.685
- I'm from Minnesota.

17:14.729 --> 17:15.947
Let's have a clean match.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.428
Ding, ding, ding!

17:18.472 --> 17:20.387
- Ow! What the--

17:20.430 --> 17:22.128
- Go, Dewey!

17:22.171 --> 17:23.999
You can do it!

17:27.611 --> 17:29.091
- Get--ugh!

17:29.135 --> 17:31.572
Oh.

17:31.615 --> 17:34.444
- Yes!

17:34.488 --> 17:35.663
- Whoa.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.666
Come help your champion!

17:38.709 --> 17:40.363
So I beat him
in a schoolyard match,

17:40.407 --> 17:42.931
and that's what he means by
"I tried to kill him."

17:42.974 --> 17:44.715
- He's the one who pushed
the ladder out from under you.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.456
- And there I was,
dangling from that tree

17:46.500 --> 17:47.588
all because
I let that little punk

17:47.631 --> 17:48.893
get underneath my skin.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.417
When really,
he was just jealous

17:50.460 --> 17:52.027
and wanted
to knock me down a peg.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.855
He had nothing to lose,
everything to gain.

17:53.898 --> 17:54.986
- Just like now.
- Totally.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.640
And now you have
the much thicker skin.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.077
- And there's no way
I'd let that happen to me now.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.817
- So what happened
after the fight?

17:59.861 --> 18:01.080
- Well,
the school called my parents

18:01.123 --> 18:02.603
and I got into a lot
of trouble.

18:02.646 --> 18:03.908
Mm, for starting a fight?

18:03.952 --> 18:05.954
- No, for stealing
the janitor's ladder.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.608
He got stuck up on the roof
for a couple of hours.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.437
Someone call my wife.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.612
Hi, honey.

18:11.655 --> 18:14.571
It's me, your wife,
Mrs. Janitor.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.312
- My wife's name is Gloria.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.922
Just bring me my ladder.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.185
Hey, hey!

18:19.228 --> 18:20.490
Stop throwing nuts.

18:22.013 --> 18:23.798
<i>- And I wasn't the only one</i>
<i>in the family</i>

18:23.841 --> 18:25.669
<i>who let someone</i>
<i>get under their skin.</i>

18:25.713 --> 18:28.411
- So today, we're talking
to some very special guests,

18:28.455 --> 18:33.112
the WWF Tag Team champions,
Tony Atlas and Rocky Johnson.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.636
So guys, you've both got
great charisma, great bodies.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.203
Rocky, you're a workhorse.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.421
You got moves on moves.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.988
Hey, thank you, Terry.

18:40.031 --> 18:40.902
- You know, I really like--
- But Tony,

18:40.945 --> 18:42.251
you come into the ring.

18:42.295 --> 18:45.167
And you lift
the guy over your head.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.561
And that's it.
You only have the one move.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.911
And the audience is eating
out of your hand.

18:49.954 --> 18:52.261
- I know.
That's all I gotta do.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.787
- So you're taking
on Rowdy Roddy Piper

18:56.831 --> 18:58.659
and
George "The Animal" Steele

18:58.702 --> 19:00.835
at the Backyard Brawl-B-Q.

19:00.878 --> 19:03.620
What can we expect
from the Soul Patrol?

19:03.664 --> 19:06.188
Well, um, whatever it is,

19:06.232 --> 19:09.539
I'm sure it will involve me
doing 99% of the work

19:09.583 --> 19:13.064
and Tony lifting a guy
at the end.

19:15.066 --> 19:17.286
Do I sense some tension here?

19:17.330 --> 19:18.766
- Yeah.
What's up, Rock?

19:18.809 --> 19:20.289
You mad at me,

19:20.333 --> 19:23.727
or did you get up on
the wrong side of the waterbed?

19:23.771 --> 19:25.033
For the finest waterbeds,

19:25.076 --> 19:28.079
check out
King Titan's Luxury Goods.

19:28.123 --> 19:29.951
No, I'm not mad.

19:29.994 --> 19:31.648
I'm just speaking the truth.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.434
I start the match,
grind our opponents down.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.218
Then you come in
at the very end

19:36.262 --> 19:37.350
and get the pin.

19:37.393 --> 19:38.742
Rocky does the work.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.222
Tony gets the credit.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.093
<i>- Well,</i>
<i>I don't know about you, Terry,</i>

19:42.137 --> 19:44.705
<i>but I'm sensing some trouble</i>
<i>in paradise.</i>

19:44.748 --> 19:46.533
Why don't we take a break

19:46.576 --> 19:48.448
and give these two time
to cool off?

19:48.491 --> 19:50.624
In the meantime,
we're taking your calls.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.541
That was amazing.

19:54.584 --> 19:55.890
You guys played that perfectly.

19:55.933 --> 19:58.153
Oh, Sidney Poitier over here.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.720
That was some great acting,
Rock.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.591
- I totally bought it.
- Thanks, Tone.

20:01.635 --> 20:02.984
You weren't too bad yourself
there.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.333
<i>- Because my mom loved</i>
<i>soap operas,</i>

20:04.377 --> 20:06.335
<i>she understood</i>
<i>that the best story lines</i>

20:06.379 --> 20:08.729
<i>always came</i>
<i>from a kernel of truth.</i>

20:08.772 --> 20:09.730
- Wow.

20:09.773 --> 20:10.948
The phone lines are blowing up.

20:10.992 --> 20:12.559
- Looks like the fans
are buying it too.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.256
- This tension

20:14.300 --> 20:16.650
is gonna get everyone invested
in your match at the Brawl-B-Q.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.260
I'm planning something big
for you guys.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.827
I've got Lia on Line 2?

20:19.870 --> 20:21.437
She wants to know
what the hell is going on.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.265
<i>- Integrating</i>
<i>out-of-the-ring drama</i>

20:23.309 --> 20:24.745
was something
that would eventually become

20:24.788 --> 20:26.573
a fixture in the world
of pro wrestling.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.618
My mom
and a few other visionaries,

20:28.662 --> 20:30.272
they were well ahead
of their time.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.361
But she still had
her challenges ahead of her.

20:32.405 --> 20:33.841
- Hm.
- So, hey.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.930
We had the team do some digging
on this Julien guy.

20:35.973 --> 20:37.453
He's a real piece of work.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.586
- He's a chiropractor
with two stars on Yelp,

20:39.629 --> 20:41.240
divorced, one son.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.763
He's been banned
from the Olive Garden

20:42.806 --> 20:43.938
for complaining too much.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.592
And apparently
he has tweeted about you

20:45.635 --> 20:48.203
every day since you announced
you were running for president.

20:50.945 --> 20:54.427
- Uh, "Who actually knows
if The Rock loves America?"

20:54.470 --> 20:56.080
- Oh.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.300
Uh, "How do we know he's not
on steroids?"

20:58.344 --> 20:59.519
- Ooh.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.651
"No way that was him singing
in 'Moana.'"

21:01.695 --> 21:04.306
- My favorite.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.529
Well, that's been a nice,
fun trip down memory lane.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.313
I have an interview
to prep for.

21:13.402 --> 21:14.882
Uh, oh, it's a kitten video.

21:14.925 --> 21:17.624
<i>"The Rock hates kittens."</i>
<i>Of course, yeah.</i>

21:25.588 --> 21:27.286
<i>I think that's a good idea.</i>
