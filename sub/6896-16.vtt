WEBVTT

00:12.096 --> 00:13.429
Hurry up, Zeb!

00:16.934 --> 00:17.975
Steady.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.773
Cargo transfer complete.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.069
Thanks, Phoenix Squadron.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.280
Transport's clear. Let's get out of here.

00:35.786 --> 00:39.205
Phoenix Leader, my hyperdrive
is damaged. Attempting to dock.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.958
Make it quick, Phoenix Two.
Those fighters are closing in!

00:47.506 --> 00:50.049
Phoenix Two is gone.
We have to jump now!

00:59.643 --> 01:02.145
At best, our squadron is at half strength.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.688
We're not just losing fighters,

01:03.772 --> 01:06.649
we're losing pilots faster
than we can replace them.

01:06.942 --> 01:10.445
Until we can find a base, we need
somewhere to land our fighters.

01:10.529 --> 01:13.072
Perhaps we can solve
two problems at once.

01:13.157 --> 01:16.325
A rebel cell has reported
an Imperial carrier over their world.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.705
lf we can steal that ship,
we can use it to house all our fighters.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.750
This cell is located
in the Ryloth system.

01:23.959 --> 01:27.336
Ryloth? I know the cell
you're talking about.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.088
I'll contact them.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.342
You're actually gonna talk to him?

01:34.136 --> 01:37.722
I don't think we have much choice.
We need that carrier.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.185
What's wrong with Ryloth?

01:54.531 --> 01:57.074
Hera. This is unexpected.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.702
Father, we need to talk.

02:16.428 --> 02:17.428
How do I look?

02:17.513 --> 02:20.056
Same as always. Why?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.474
No reason.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.311
Straighten up a little bit.
You're making me look bad.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.146
What's the matter with you?

02:27.231 --> 02:29.398
Nothing. Just calm down.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.483
You calm down.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.114
It's been a long time, Father.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.578
You must be the Jedi I've heard about.

02:43.247 --> 02:45.039
Jarrus. Kanan Jarrus. I've...

02:46.291 --> 02:47.708
Heard a lot about you too, sir.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.004
This is the rest of our crew.

02:52.089 --> 02:55.132
Ezra, Sabine and Zeb.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.221
A fine group of fighters.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.765
Cham Syndulla at your service.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.018
The Liberator of Ryloth.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.563
I studied your Clone War
tactics at the Academy.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.189
Yes.

03:10.274 --> 03:13.401
The Empire is still
trying to figure out how to beat me.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.279
These are two of my finest warriors.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.947
Numa and Gobi.

03:18.782 --> 03:22.034
Well, we should get to the briefing.
There's a lot to do.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.249
The Empire has a light carrier
in orbit over Ryloth

03:28.333 --> 03:30.251
they use to bomb the Twi'lek rebels.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.546
The ship's well defended, but we can
get aboard using the stolen bomber

03:33.630 --> 03:35.006
while the squadron is away.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.467
One team secures the hangar,
the other storms the bridge.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.928
Then we jump out
before they figure out what hit them.

03:42.097 --> 03:46.058
No. This monstrosity
has rained destruction and death

03:46.143 --> 03:48.102
on the citizens of Ryloth.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.897
It is not enough
that it simply disappears.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.774
My people need to see it fall from
the sky in flames,

03:53.859 --> 03:55.276
as a symbol of our strength.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.280
So I recommend a change in plans.

03:59.531 --> 04:03.075
Using my bomber,
schematics and timetables,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.870
we can destroy the carrier
when it's most vulnerable.

04:06.121 --> 04:09.165
lf you could have destroyed it,
you would have done so already.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.501
You need us, and we need the carrier.

04:12.961 --> 04:17.131
We need each other.
Cham's intel, Hera's plan.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.425
This works, we all win.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.804
Very well.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.224
With Jedi on our side, how can we fail?

04:31.980 --> 04:35.024
Hey, what's going on
between you and your father?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.109
We haven't spoken in years.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.070
He was a hero in the Clone War,

04:39.154 --> 04:42.573
fought with the Jedi
to free Ryloth from the droid army.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.951
But after the war,
the Republic became the Empire

04:45.035 --> 04:48.746
and refused to leave,
so he started fighting them.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.332
Once my mother was killed
in the resistance,

04:51.416 --> 04:54.502
Ryloth's freedom became the most
important thing to him.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.005
More important than family?

05:00.175 --> 05:03.219
It's almost time.
We should head out soon.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.931
Well, there's nothing
more important to me.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.729
ls that the old astromech
you found during the Clone War?

05:14.856 --> 05:16.440
His name is Chopper.

05:19.361 --> 05:23.114
lf you gave me half the attention you
gave this second-rate junk pile,

05:23.198 --> 05:24.949
we'd have liberated Ryloth by now.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.453
This is what's wrong with you, child.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.706
You hold on to the wrong things,

05:31.790 --> 05:35.084
devote your time
and effort to lost causes.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.003
What a waste.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.588
I am not wasting my life.

05:39.923 --> 05:43.426
I help people. I lead ships into battle.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.928
I am part of something bigger.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.304
The Rebellion.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.182
I thought you knew better
than to put your faith in outsiders.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.436
You forget what happened
when we trusted the Republic.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.271
This is different.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.024
The rebels are fighting to free everyone.

05:58.442 --> 05:59.942
Free everyone?

06:00.027 --> 06:03.779
I don't care about everyone.
I care only about Ryloth.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.950
So I've noticed.

06:35.187 --> 06:38.647
Master Windu spoke highly of your
heroics at the Battle of Lessu.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.067
Mace Windu.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.944
Outnumbered 100 to one,

06:44.029 --> 06:47.907
we charged across
Lessu's energy bridge to certain doom.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.575
We would not be stopped.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.996
They named that attack in songs,
The Hammer of Ryloth.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.837
Cham has taken a shine to your Jedi.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.923
More the other way around.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.550
General Syndulla,
I could listen to your stories all day.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.220
And I could tell them all day.

07:09.304 --> 07:12.681
Your father's not such a bad guy.
I see a lot of him in you.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.227
What?

07:16.311 --> 07:19.063
You're both great leaders
trying to help people.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.565
You don't know him like I do.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.287
Gobi, get ready for landing.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.125
lf the Empire is on schedule,

07:39.209 --> 07:41.418
they should be
sending their bombers to the surface,

07:41.503 --> 07:43.546
which will make the ship
more vulnerable.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.214
They're always on schedule.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.730
There they go. I'm signaling the
A-wings. Let's hope this works.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.081
Bomber pilot to carrier.
We are under attack by rebel fighters!

08:19.166 --> 08:21.417
Request permission
for emergency landing!

08:21.501 --> 08:24.003
Incoming bomber,
transmit your clearance code.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.630
Code is 7-2-5...

08:27.299 --> 08:28.591
Proceed to bay two.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.050
We'll cover you.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.111
Rebels have fled.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.238
We've been hit! Coming in hot!

08:55.327 --> 08:56.911
Might consider slowing down.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.288
This has to look good. Hang on!

09:00.123 --> 09:01.874
I hate it when she says that.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.647
Get a squad down there.
Initiate crash protocols.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.241
Explosives?

09:38.036 --> 09:39.912
-Sorry, my friends.
-What?

09:39.996 --> 09:41.622
-Traitors!
-No, wait!

09:43.667 --> 09:44.833
I heard shots.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.171
Father, what are you doing?

09:51.216 --> 09:54.176
We only needed your help
to get on board. I'm sorry.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.184
Pilot.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.688
Drop your weapon! Hands up!

10:09.234 --> 10:10.484
Freeze! Don't move!

10:15.407 --> 10:19.410
Set your charges on the munitions
ranks. I'm going for the engine room.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.539
Chopper!

10:25.917 --> 10:27.042
Chopper, get up!

10:33.466 --> 10:37.177
Yes, I know my father betrayed us.
Thanks for the update, buddy.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.558
Kanan, come on! Kanan, wake up!

10:43.435 --> 10:46.395
On second thought,
I don't like your father anymore.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.984
Hera our "friends"
have bags full of detonators.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.529
Enough to blow up this carrier.
We're scrubbing the mission, right?

10:55.613 --> 10:57.072
No, we're finishing it.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.283
We'll stop my father,
then we'll steal this ship.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.367
We'll take the bridge.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.579
Zeb, you and Sabine check the
munitions rack for those detonators.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.708
They blow those up,
and this whole ship will go too.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.377
Everyone on Ryloth
will be able to see that fireball.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.880
I think that's the idea.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.926
Sir, we've lost contact
with the containment squad.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.971
I want a full detachment sent
to the adjacent hangar.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.353
There's Numa. Get down!

11:27.437 --> 11:29.104
I can stun her from here.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.273
Hey!

11:31.399 --> 11:34.360
You hit one proton bomb,
and you'll touch off the whole magazine.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.611
I wasn't planning to miss.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.408
-You should've let me!
-You'll get your chance.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.623
See? There's something you can shoot.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.874
That'll do.

11:58.593 --> 12:02.179
General. The rebels are awake.
They are trying to stop us.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.639
ls Hera with them?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.933
No. It is just the Lasat
and the Mandalorian.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.519
Set the charges.
I will deal with my daughter.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.737
Blast 'em!

12:22.492 --> 12:23.992
Close the blast doors.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.539
Ezra, now!

12:55.150 --> 12:56.275
After you.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.445
Chopper, get this door open.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.910
We don't have time for a standoff.
You got any ideas?

13:06.995 --> 13:08.954
Yeah. Catch me that droid.

13:11.875 --> 13:12.916
Stand down!

13:19.048 --> 13:21.842
I have already contacted
reinforcements.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.135
Thanks for the heads-up.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.015
Kanan, do your thing.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.684
Actually, Ezra, you take this one.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.562
Okay. Okay. I got this.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.397
I got this.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.442
You're going to abandon ship.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.569
I will not abandon my ship.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.240
You are going to abandon ship.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.619
We are going to abandon ship.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.665
The fire in hangar bay three
is out of control.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.251
Abandon ship. Get to the escape pods.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.380
"I really mean it.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.299
"This is the captain."

14:02.467 --> 14:05.511
I really mean it. This is the captain.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.514
Get to the escape pods. Abandon ship.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.682
The fire is out of control.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.726
You should get going.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.186
I should get going.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.146
Not bad for your first time.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.732
All right, Hera. We're on the clock.
Get us outta here.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.442
The bridge is secure.
What's your status?

14:21.110 --> 14:25.030
The usual.
But Sabine has a plan of sorts.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.865
Yeah. Sort of a great plan.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.056
Sabine's plan actually worked.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.392
Hey, don't sound so surprised.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.060
There's no sign of Cham.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.979
-Find him.
-Better hurry.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.981
We are not going anywhere.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.566
You're too late, Father.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.526
Chopper, make the jump to hyperspace.

15:03.987 --> 15:07.281
The hyperdrive's off-line?
What did you do?

15:07.991 --> 15:10.492
I must destroy this ship for Ryloth.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.917
Gobi, Numa, proceed with our plans.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.837
Apologies, General Syndulla.
We have been captured.

15:22.005 --> 15:25.340
Cham, we don't have time for this.
Imperial reinforcements will be coming.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.385
Destroy this ship,
and the Empire will just send another.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.138
But if we take it,
we can use it to fight them.

15:31.222 --> 15:34.433
You haven't been here to see what the
Empire has done to our world.

15:34.517 --> 15:38.103
They plunder our wealth
and sell our people into slavery.

15:38.187 --> 15:41.189
This ship must burn,
for all Ryloth to see.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.121
I want freedom
from the Empire as badly as you,

15:56.205 --> 15:58.999
but this battle can't
be won on Ryloth alone.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.711
During the Clone War,
you didn't just fight for a village,

16:02.795 --> 16:06.465
you rallied everyone
to liberate the entire planet.

16:06.549 --> 16:07.883
You inspired me.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.177
The Rebellion is no different.

16:10.261 --> 16:14.139
But either you couldn't see that
or you didn't believe in me.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.891
And that's why I left.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.646
She's right. We have the ship.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.565
We just have to buy her enough
time to get us out of here.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.405
I am with you, Hera.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.991
I am also with you.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.576
Well, Father?

16:39.540 --> 16:42.876
I guess you have your
chance to prove me wrong.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.129
Everyone, get to the turrets.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.798
We're on our way, Hera.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.386
Father, tell Chopper
how to fix the hyperdrive.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.395
Focus all fire on that shuttle.
We can't let them retake the ship.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.775
Five targets inbound!

17:07.527 --> 17:08.610
I'm on them!

17:11.948 --> 17:14.282
-They got past me!
-I see 'em!

17:14.367 --> 17:16.410
-Kanan, the shuttle!
-I know, I know!

17:24.127 --> 17:25.127
We did it!

17:25.378 --> 17:26.962
Your victory will be brief.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.090
As I feared, the bombers have returned.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.386
We're not in the clear yet.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.975
Incoming torpedoes!

17:40.184 --> 17:41.560
Taking evasive action.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.147
Two targets at 3.9.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.275
Missed one!

17:49.986 --> 17:50.986
I've got it!

17:56.451 --> 17:57.659
Lousy Imps!

18:02.498 --> 18:03.498
Ezra!

18:05.626 --> 18:06.710
Yeah, yeah!

18:12.300 --> 18:14.009
Lost our stabilizer!

18:24.145 --> 18:25.520
Come on!

18:40.870 --> 18:43.455
We were always stronger together.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.589
The rebels have stabilized the carrier.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.884
All ahead full.
We must not allow them to escape.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.557
The light cruiser is coming after us,
but I think I know a way to stop it.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.684
I'll help you.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.438
It's okay. Go. Hurry!

19:09.732 --> 19:12.234
Droid, I shut down
the hyperdrive's power coupling

19:12.318 --> 19:13.902
on the third and fourth reactor.

19:14.362 --> 19:15.570
Sabine, meet me in the hangar.

19:21.577 --> 19:22.911
I've armed the explosives.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.914
You actually think
this ridiculous plan will work?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.791
Yeah. Kinda fun, isn't it?

19:34.590 --> 19:36.967
I set the anti-grav. Just give it a push.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.563
You wanted to blow something up.
Here's your chance.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.237
They've set one of the bombers adrift.

19:57.446 --> 20:01.157
A foolish tactic. Expect more
obstacles, but stay the course.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.256
The forward magazine's been hit!

20:21.470 --> 20:23.805
For you, my people.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.271
All right, let's see what she can do.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.118
I'm getting reports from all over Ryloth.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.704
Our people are rallying
against the Empire.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.206
Every hour, more join our ranks.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.541
Glad to hear it, sir.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.501
Daughter, may we speak?

20:54.629 --> 20:59.549
When you left, I was heartbroken,
but now I understand.

21:00.134 --> 21:03.678
You're like your mother.
She was once a dreamer too.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.890
But I learned to be a leader
by watching you.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.812
I am proud of you, Captain Syndulla.
