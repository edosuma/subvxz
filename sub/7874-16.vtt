WEBVTT

00:32.055 --> 00:35.600
Just a little bit farther
for your anniversary surprise.

00:35.767 --> 00:38.187
Is it my own vineyard?
Oh, Francine, you knew.

00:38.354 --> 00:40.773
I never said anything,
because it sounded so fey.

00:40.940 --> 00:42.525
It's a rosebush.

00:42.691 --> 00:46.654
I planted it to commemorate
the first time we ever made love.

00:46.821 --> 00:49.324
And though that moment
only lasted seconds...

00:49.491 --> 00:52.869
...this bush will last forever.

00:57.290 --> 01:01.128
Look at that, honey. A bunch of other
people planted rosebushes just like you.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.506
Oh, no. Those are all mine.

01:03.673 --> 01:06.175
Each one for a different man
I slept with.

01:06.342 --> 01:09.387
- But you were my last.
- All of these?

01:09.971 --> 01:11.348
It's not that many.

01:11.515 --> 01:14.726
This is the largest sex garden
in North America.

01:14.893 --> 01:18.230
Rumor has it, within its unexplored
depths lives an Indian tribe...

01:18.397 --> 01:22.110
...who have never seen a white man.

01:28.324 --> 01:30.910
Hey, now, friend, hold on.
What is that?

01:31.077 --> 01:33.956
Cougar Boost energy drink.
I gotta cram for finals.

01:34.123 --> 01:35.916
You have finals at community college?

01:36.083 --> 01:38.043
Yeah. I'm gonna pull
an all-afternooner.

01:41.255 --> 01:43.591
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

01:43.757 --> 01:47.762
I gotta write this down.
"Evolution is like IKEA for animals."

01:47.929 --> 01:51.057
- Your growling can intrigues me.
- So take a sip.

01:51.224 --> 01:54.060
"May lead to extreme extremeness."

01:54.227 --> 01:57.023
I don't know.
I usually like to have my wits about me.

01:57.189 --> 02:00.109
- Then don't have some.
- No, no, no.

02:05.114 --> 02:09.494
I feel weird.
Something's happening to my body.

02:09.661 --> 02:12.289
I feel... I feel...

02:19.547 --> 02:22.300
Take it somewhere else, spaz.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.396
It's no use.
It's not gonna happen tonight.

02:34.563 --> 02:35.939
Give me a chance.

02:36.106 --> 02:40.070
Who's a good boy? Who wants to play
catchy-ball? Come on, catchy-ball.

02:40.236 --> 02:44.074
Francine, stop. My penis is not a dog.
It's Batman.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.451
Don't worry.
There are ways to treat it:

02:46.618 --> 02:50.372
Meditation, Cialis, Ginkgo biloba...

02:50.538 --> 02:53.667
You know, for your memory,
because you forgot how to get a boner.

02:53.834 --> 02:56.045
Hey, I'm not the problem,
you're the problem.

02:56.212 --> 02:58.422
I've never slept
with anyone except you.

02:58.589 --> 03:00.841
But you, you have a sex garden...

03:01.008 --> 03:03.678
<i>...that was on the cover of
Sex Garden Magazine.</i>

03:05.555 --> 03:08.100
Oh, is that what this is about,
my past?

03:08.266 --> 03:11.645
Stan, that was just sex.
Sex without love is meaningless.

03:11.812 --> 03:14.065
I'm listening,
I'm looking in your eyes...

03:14.232 --> 03:17.026
...but I see you taking
more poundings than Omaha Beach...

03:17.193 --> 03:18.861
...before the ground assault began.

03:19.028 --> 03:20.238
All right, that's it.

03:20.405 --> 03:24.117
Can't a guy sit in the closet
and get drunk with Francine's shoes...

03:24.283 --> 03:26.286
...without being barraged by filth?

03:26.453 --> 03:29.915
I don't need to know
what goes on in your bedroom.

03:33.836 --> 03:35.630
Hey, Steve, it's Thursday night.

03:35.797 --> 03:38.383
It's time to tease some pedophiles
on the Internet.

03:38.550 --> 03:42.762
An insurance salesman in Ohio
wants to fly me to Disneyland.

03:42.929 --> 03:46.474
- What did you do to your computer?
- Gotta find out how it works.

03:46.642 --> 03:48.811
It's electricity,
but it's gotta be physical.

03:48.978 --> 03:51.564
It's not magic.
Something's gotta be pushing things.

03:51.730 --> 03:53.774
It's gotta be pushing things.
Like a watch.

03:53.941 --> 03:56.235
One lever moves the other.
It's about precision.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.030
Things gotta be pushing other things.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.078
You better lay off that Cougar Boost.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.831
You better wake up
and listen to what you're saying.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.959
I'm scared.

04:10.126 --> 04:13.546
I'm staying in here with you, belly.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.884
Hi, honey.

04:18.050 --> 04:21.137
Oh, Stan, I know we've been
kind of rocky lately...

04:21.305 --> 04:24.474
...so I decided
to book us a romantic getaway.

04:24.641 --> 04:29.187
To Texas, where the president
pretends to be from.

04:29.354 --> 04:32.901
What the fudge, Stan?
You have been avoiding me for a week.

04:33.067 --> 04:35.153
Well, I can't change how I feel.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.989
You making love
to all those other men.

04:38.156 --> 04:40.658
It wasn't making love, it was sex.

04:40.825 --> 04:44.413
Mechanical, degrading,
pulling-gravel-from-my-knees sex.

04:44.580 --> 04:47.207
- It meant nothing.
- Liar.

04:47.374 --> 04:51.629
You're saying that to make me feel better
because I've never had sex with anyone.

04:51.795 --> 04:53.632
- Then go do it.
- Go do what?

04:53.798 --> 04:55.258
Go sleep with another woman.

04:55.425 --> 04:58.887
Then you'll see that sex with somebody
you don't love is no big deal.

04:59.054 --> 05:01.181
Don't be ridiculous.
I can't cheat on you.

05:01.348 --> 05:04.602
- You have my permission.
- But not God's permission.

05:04.769 --> 05:08.689
I took sacred vows on our wedding day,
and I don't take vows lightly.

05:08.856 --> 05:13.194
<i>Like when I saw The Sixth Sense
and vowed to never tell the big twist...</i>

05:13.361 --> 05:15.989
...where it turns out Haley Joel Osment
is Keyser SÃ¶ze.

05:16.156 --> 05:18.450
But, Stan, we have to do something.

05:18.617 --> 05:23.872
I'm sorry, Francine, there's no
conceivable way we can get around this.

05:24.039 --> 05:25.540
What am I doing in here?

05:30.046 --> 05:33.049
- What's this?
- You can sleep with another woman...

05:33.216 --> 05:35.218
...without breaking your vows.

05:35.385 --> 05:36.928
I'm divorcing you.

05:43.727 --> 05:48.148
The thing is, I've been with so many
men that he couldn't perform in bed.

05:48.315 --> 05:51.861
Couldn't rise to the occasion,
not even a little.

05:53.196 --> 05:54.698
Then we started to drift apart.

05:54.864 --> 05:58.410
So I divorced him until such a time
as Daddy can get some strange.

05:58.576 --> 06:01.539
What are you guys talking about?
You guys are divorced?

06:01.705 --> 06:03.124
Hayley, your mother insisted.

06:03.290 --> 06:05.084
She's convinced that if I have sex...

06:05.251 --> 06:08.254
...I'll conquer my insecurities,
and we can get married again.

06:08.421 --> 06:13.427
You better go hit the singles bars. You
should go to Tuggles for ladies' night.

06:13.593 --> 06:16.680
Crowd's a little older,
but, boy, do they love wang.

06:16.847 --> 06:19.015
I have one of those.

06:19.182 --> 06:20.350
This is insane.

06:20.517 --> 06:22.895
Steve, don't just sit there.
Say something.

06:23.062 --> 06:25.690
Can I borrow some money?
I'm all out of Cougar Boost.

06:25.857 --> 06:27.775
Steve, our parents are divorced.

06:27.942 --> 06:31.112
Well, then give me money for that.
What do you care? I'm thirsty.

06:31.279 --> 06:34.616
Gotta dust off
the old single-Stan threads.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.460
Oh, yeah.

06:44.627 --> 06:46.880
Haven't seen this guy in a while.

06:47.046 --> 06:51.009
Did someone order
a sexy Persian wingman?

06:51.176 --> 06:52.719
Let's go. I gotta keep moving...

06:52.886 --> 06:56.223
...or these pants will cut off
my circulation and my legs will die.

06:58.809 --> 07:02.646
Okay, here's my club persona.
I'm a Persian stud, name of Rashid.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.982
I drive an M3
with tricked-out ground effects.

07:05.149 --> 07:07.277
I live with my parents.
Big house, no yard.

07:07.444 --> 07:08.987
I sell ex, but I don't use it.

07:09.154 --> 07:13.450
I'm gonna go take a lap,
pounce on the first badonkadonk I see.

07:13.617 --> 07:16.703
Now I remember why I hate
these places: Crowded, loud.

07:16.870 --> 07:20.208
But if Francine thinks
this is gonna save our marriage...

07:22.168 --> 07:24.462
All right, target identified.

07:24.629 --> 07:27.798
Let's bring on the charm.

07:29.092 --> 07:30.510
- Hi, I'm...
- Intercourse!

07:30.677 --> 07:32.346
- Excuse me?
- Intercourse.

07:32.512 --> 07:36.266
I'm going to have intercourse with you.
I'm divorced. It's fine.

07:36.433 --> 07:40.855
God, I guess I'm a little rusty.
Need to ease into it a bit.

07:41.022 --> 07:43.733
Foreplay, then intercourse!

07:47.570 --> 07:48.613
Excuse me, miss.

07:48.780 --> 07:51.032
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- No.

07:51.199 --> 07:55.579
My daughter and I were touring
the Capitol and our car ran out of gas.

07:55.746 --> 07:58.499
We need to get back to Concord
for my mom's funeral.

07:58.666 --> 08:00.709
All I need is $40 for gas.

08:00.876 --> 08:03.713
If you give me your address,
I'll send it back to you.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.048
I'm a Christian.

08:05.215 --> 08:07.133
What are you talking about? Get out.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.678
Okay. God bless you, miss.

08:13.849 --> 08:15.559
Get away from my bowl. Get a job.

08:15.726 --> 08:18.312
Fought for this country.

08:20.731 --> 08:23.109
So my buddy Maloosh
is producing some porn.

08:23.275 --> 08:26.738
You guys should get involved.
It makes you feel good about yourself.

08:26.905 --> 08:29.491
This was a stupid idea.
Let's get out of here.

08:29.658 --> 08:31.576
Buddy, I'm not ready yet.

08:31.743 --> 08:34.705
Hey, this is my boy, Baruz.
He imports rugs.

08:34.871 --> 08:38.543
Take the one on the end, she's related
to Judith Light. Won't shut up.

08:38.710 --> 08:41.421
I'm just gonna go.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.923
Thank God. That guy sucked so much.

08:44.090 --> 08:47.302
I only invited him because
our folks had to escape Tehran together.

08:47.469 --> 08:50.723
We left everything behind:
Our house, our cars, my little brother.

08:50.889 --> 08:54.768
Oh, my God, this is my song!
I totally asked him to play this!

09:29.222 --> 09:30.265
That's plagiarism.

09:30.432 --> 09:33.895
I'm gonna call the da Vinci family.
You're gonna owe them so much money.

09:34.061 --> 09:37.440
- I don't even care.
- You are one cool customer.

09:37.607 --> 09:40.735
- And that just pisses you off, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it does.

09:40.902 --> 09:43.572
- You wanna shoot me, don't you?
- You have no idea.

09:43.739 --> 09:46.116
- Why don't you do it, then?
- Think I won't?

09:46.283 --> 09:47.868
- I'll shoot back.
- I'm gonna.

09:48.035 --> 09:50.454
- I'm cocking my gun.
- One. Safety's off.

09:50.621 --> 09:51.830
Two. Mine was never on.

09:51.997 --> 09:53.666
- Three.
- Three.

09:59.631 --> 10:02.967
- How did you know I was wearing a vest?
- I didn't.

10:03.134 --> 10:05.638
I have a rowboat,
so it's no big deal to dump stuff.

10:05.804 --> 10:07.264
You know I was wearing a vest?

10:07.431 --> 10:11.560
No, I was already composing
your suicide note when you stood up.

10:14.647 --> 10:18.860
That's a good-looking Glock.
Your wife give you that Glock?

10:19.027 --> 10:22.697
- I'm recently divorced. You?
- No. I'm married to my work.

10:22.864 --> 10:25.825
- Law enforcement? Mercenary?
- No, the complete opposite.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.703
- Couch upholsterer?
- Bingo.

10:27.870 --> 10:29.664
- You run a bingo parlor?
- Yes.

10:31.707 --> 10:36.170
Ahoy, fair masticators.
Behold your fondue.

10:36.337 --> 10:38.674
But please wait 30 minutes
before eating...

10:38.840 --> 10:42.844
...for it is far too hot
for human consumption.

10:43.011 --> 10:47.516
Hotter than the pair of speakers
I bought today off the back of a truck.

10:47.683 --> 10:52.146
Hotter than three rats
fornicating in a wool sock.

10:52.313 --> 10:57.193
Hotter than the burning flesh
of Shel Silverstein in hell.

10:57.360 --> 11:00.280
I don't care how hot this is.
I'm not waiting 10 minutes.

11:00.447 --> 11:03.826
- I'm not waiting 10 seconds.
- I'm gonna put my hand in the cheese.

11:03.993 --> 11:07.371
I'm gonna take my contact out,
dip it in, and put it back in my eye.

11:07.538 --> 11:10.249
- Do it, then.
- Think I won't?

11:10.416 --> 11:12.460
- I had a great time tonight.
- Me too.

11:12.627 --> 11:14.629
Thanks for picking up the tab.

11:14.796 --> 11:16.089
You'll get the next one.

11:16.256 --> 11:20.093
- There will be a next one, won't there?
- You bet.

11:29.729 --> 11:31.647
Hey, look at that smile.

11:31.814 --> 11:36.319
- Somebody got a little nasty no-no.
- No, not yet.

11:36.486 --> 11:37.612
But I did meet someone.

11:37.779 --> 11:40.365
Her name's Joanna.
We had the most magical evening.

11:40.532 --> 11:43.201
We talked, shared some laughs,
had some gunplay.

11:43.368 --> 11:46.289
- You were supposed to have sex with her.
- I'm easing into it.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.083
We have another date tomorrow.
We're going on a picnic.

11:51.043 --> 11:55.256
Should I call her? No, no, I shouldn't.
I don't wanna seem desperate.

11:56.967 --> 12:01.555
It's Joanna. She doesn't play games.
What a gal. I'm gonna take this upstairs.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.807
Hey, you.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.602
No, I fell, but it's totally cool.

12:15.278 --> 12:17.280
Yeah, my game
was pretty tight last night.

12:17.447 --> 12:20.117
I scored two tenderonis.
I don't know their names.

12:20.284 --> 12:23.913
Anyway, madam, I wanna dispute some
of these charges on my cell phone bill.

12:24.079 --> 12:26.081
I don't know anyone in Victorville.

12:26.248 --> 12:29.795
No, no, no, wait.
Yeah, I do. I do. Sorry.

12:29.961 --> 12:32.422
Frannie, bar whores.
Bar whores, Frannie.

12:32.589 --> 12:34.424
Hi.

12:35.592 --> 12:41.057
Oh, Roger, Stan was supposed
to have sex with her, not fall in love.

12:41.224 --> 12:44.101
This whole divorce thing
was a bad idea.

12:44.268 --> 12:48.356
I pushed him into this
and now he's falling for another woman.

12:48.523 --> 12:52.486
It's not too late. Go to him
and tell him you made a mistake.

12:52.653 --> 12:55.989
Salt. Remember, love is patient, kind.

12:56.156 --> 12:59.034
Love will rise again each morning
like the sun.

12:59.201 --> 13:00.827
Be ready for that dawn.

13:00.994 --> 13:03.748
You're handing me the salt?
I want it on my eggs.

13:03.915 --> 13:06.543
Shake it. Shake it on my eggs.

13:06.709 --> 13:10.338
Too much. It's ruined.
Get out. You disgust me.

13:12.632 --> 13:16.053
Great girls.
I can make the ugly one cry like that.

13:18.722 --> 13:23.519
Tickets to Battlestar Galactica On Ice?
These have been sold out for months.

13:23.686 --> 13:26.356
- How did you get them?
- How does anybody anything?

13:26.523 --> 13:28.358
They're 20 bucks.
You want them or not?

13:28.525 --> 13:30.402
I got other people I can sell to.

13:30.569 --> 13:34.281
Bruce Willis wants them. That girl
who played Tank Girl wants them.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.159
These look like they're handwritten.

13:37.326 --> 13:39.120
That's it. Tickets are off the table.

13:39.287 --> 13:41.914
Hello, Bruce?
Have Rumer and Tallulah meet me.

13:42.081 --> 13:44.458
Do something!

13:44.625 --> 13:48.005
Okay, we want them. We want them.

13:48.171 --> 13:51.341
Lori Petty is the man
who played Tank Girl.

13:52.092 --> 13:56.096
Stan, where have you been?
I went to the park, I left you messages.

13:56.263 --> 13:58.056
My phone was off.
What's going on?

13:58.224 --> 14:00.601
Have you slept with her yet?

14:00.768 --> 14:02.353
- No.
- Thank God.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.731
Look, I made a terrible mistake.

14:04.897 --> 14:07.442
I'm sorry for pushing you
into this situation.

14:07.608 --> 14:10.946
Whatever our issues are,
we'll work through them together.

14:11.113 --> 14:13.574
I love you.

14:14.533 --> 14:16.702
- What's wrong?
- I can't cheat on my wife.

14:16.869 --> 14:19.038
I'm your wife.

14:19.204 --> 14:22.375
I got remarried.
Francine, could you take a picture of us?

14:22.542 --> 14:24.502
You push the button halfway to focus.

14:24.669 --> 14:27.422
Well, you know.
You bought it for me.

14:33.471 --> 14:36.766
- We weren't expecting to get married.
- We were gonna play laser tag.

14:36.932 --> 14:40.019
- We love laser tag, don't we, husband?
- I'm her husband.

14:40.186 --> 14:42.939
I can't believe you got married.

14:43.106 --> 14:46.234
Funny story. You like funny stories.
This is your type of humor.

14:46.401 --> 14:47.944
We were walking on the beach...

14:48.111 --> 14:50.030
Oh, a wedding.

14:50.197 --> 14:52.032
Lots of guys are afraid of commitment.

14:52.199 --> 14:55.495
I'm not. I'll commit to anything.
I'm on a six-year cell phone plan.

14:55.661 --> 14:59.415
<i>- I have a 14-year gym membership.
- I have a lifetime subscription to Ebony.</i>

14:59.582 --> 15:02.085
- Checked the wrong box. Not giving it up.
- Oh, yeah?

15:02.251 --> 15:05.506
- I'll march over and get married right now.
- You think I won't?

15:05.672 --> 15:08.008
- I'm not scared.
- I'll marry the crap out of you.

15:08.175 --> 15:11.261
Do you, Patrick, promise to...

15:11.887 --> 15:14.097
- So do you...?
- Stan.

15:14.264 --> 15:16.100
Stan. Promise to...

15:16.267 --> 15:18.520
Anywho, we're registered
at Williams-Sonoma.

15:18.686 --> 15:20.855
She loves the finer things, this one.

15:21.022 --> 15:23.733
- Honey, can I have my lipstick?
- Oh, sure.

15:24.651 --> 15:26.903
What the fuck is going on?

15:27.070 --> 15:30.032
- Joanna, could you give us a...?
- Sure, I'll be in the car.

15:30.199 --> 15:33.369
Kids, give your new mom
a kiss goodbye.

15:37.706 --> 15:41.169
Stan, this is ridiculous.
You have to end this right now.

15:41.336 --> 15:44.005
I'm sorry, Francine.
I took sacred wedding vows today...

15:44.172 --> 15:45.799
...and I don't take vows lightly.

15:45.966 --> 15:50.054
<i>Like when I saw Unbreakable and vowed
to never tell anyone the big twist...</i>

15:50.221 --> 15:52.431
...where Samuel Jackson isn't black.

15:52.598 --> 15:54.600
- But, Stan...
- Look, I'm sorry, Francine.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.269
I know this wasn't your plan.

15:56.435 --> 15:59.522
If it means anything,
I'll always miss you.

15:59.689 --> 16:02.526
Gotta go. We have to check
into our suite at the Radisson.

16:02.693 --> 16:08.073
We like to show up right at 5:30.
Punctuality is kind of our thing.

16:08.240 --> 16:11.326
What the fuck is going on?

16:11.493 --> 16:15.373
I'll take care of you, Mom.
I'm a wagon wheel.

16:20.628 --> 16:23.591
I drove my husband
into the well-toned arms...

16:23.757 --> 16:25.884
...of a more compatible woman.

16:26.051 --> 16:29.054
Oh, honey, don't you worry.
Single life is great.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.557
Yeah, guys take you out,
treat you special...

16:31.724 --> 16:33.642
...bring you to all the best places.

16:33.810 --> 16:34.978
Let's roll, hos.

16:35.145 --> 16:40.817
Have a kiss fight to see who gets to eat
the fruit that touches my syrup at IHOP.

16:49.744 --> 16:52.204
I'm not gonna end up a worn-out ho...

16:52.371 --> 16:55.541
...having breakfast for dinner
with an abusive Persian.

16:55.708 --> 16:59.212
I've lived that life,
and Stan saved me from it.

16:59.379 --> 17:02.049
I am getting him back
if it's the last thing I do.

17:02.215 --> 17:05.551
I'm gonna stop him
before he consummates the marriage.

17:05.719 --> 17:07.597
- Francine, wait.
- What?

17:07.763 --> 17:10.683
You waited. I made that happen.
Now go.

17:12.018 --> 17:14.979
I am a god!

17:28.619 --> 17:31.081
I'm looking for someone.
Last name Smith.

17:31.247 --> 17:35.293
Let's see. We have Smiths
in room 313, 520 and 1611.

17:35.460 --> 17:37.504
Would you like to check
any specific name?

17:37.670 --> 17:38.922
- No time.
- Are you sure?

17:39.089 --> 17:41.801
They're right here on my screen.
I could say them to you.

17:41.967 --> 17:43.719
No time!

17:51.645 --> 17:55.107
- Are you the hooker?
- Sorry, wrong Smith.

18:06.285 --> 18:10.248
- Ready, husband?
- Ready, wife.

18:12.708 --> 18:14.920
Hands off my man!

18:15.087 --> 18:17.131
It's for science.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.300
That was all three Smiths.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.137
I guess they're not here.

18:30.562 --> 18:32.230
Is something wrong?

18:35.233 --> 18:38.571
Hey, fellas. What's going on?

18:38.737 --> 18:41.699
We're your friends, Steve,
and you have a serious problem.

18:41.866 --> 18:43.534
You're an addict.

18:43.701 --> 18:46.871
Oh, my God. This is an intervention.

18:47.037 --> 18:51.585
I sold you fake tickets
and still all you wanna do is help me.

18:51.751 --> 18:54.004
Yeah, we're gonna help you.

18:54.170 --> 18:55.964
Help you pee blood.

19:03.264 --> 19:04.307
No!

19:04.473 --> 19:09.353
Let's kill his parents next.
Let's kill them all.

19:16.570 --> 19:18.530
Hey, this is my friend Manny.
He's the...

19:18.697 --> 19:22.327
- Would you like another?
- Why not? I'm one of them now.

19:22.493 --> 19:23.745
Can I borrow a quarter?

19:23.912 --> 19:28.958
I wanna call my mother and tell her I just
met the girl I wanna nail in the bathroom.

19:29.125 --> 19:32.296
- Oh, God.
- You look tense.

19:32.463 --> 19:35.591
<i>Do, do, do, do, do</i>

19:35.758 --> 19:38.594
<i>Me in the bathroom</i>

19:38.761 --> 19:43.433
Hey. Get your damn hands
off my fiancÃ©e.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.101
Stan, you're here.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.437
But I checked the hotel
for all the Smiths.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.065
Joanna and I traded rooms
with some bald guy.

19:50.231 --> 19:53.151
Said the carpet in the honeymoon suite
was spooking his frog.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.112
Don't know what it meant.

19:55.279 --> 19:58.324
- Where is she?
- I left her. We were in bed.

19:58.491 --> 20:02.203
I was gazing at her naked body,
but all I could think of was you.

20:02.370 --> 20:04.872
You, Francine. I love you.

20:05.040 --> 20:08.251
Oh, Stan, I'm so sorry.

20:08.418 --> 20:11.546
Now I know how you felt
seeing all those rosebushes.

20:11.713 --> 20:15.217
Because the thought of you being
with someone else was driving me crazy.

20:15.384 --> 20:19.013
But in my heart I knew it.
I knew you wouldn't have sex with her.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.265
- Oh, no, I had sex with her.
- What?

20:21.432 --> 20:23.434
Yeah, she's my wife.
It was my honeymoon.

20:23.601 --> 20:24.727
Anyway, you were right.

20:24.894 --> 20:27.648
Now I know what you meant
about it being just sex.

20:27.815 --> 20:30.776
All those guys you slept with
before me meant nothing.

20:30.943 --> 20:35.364
- Like the sex I just had with Joanna.
- You had sex with her?

20:35.531 --> 20:39.869
Five times. I wanted to make sure it was
consistently meaningless, and it was.

20:40.036 --> 20:45.291
The scratch marks on my back will
forever be a tribute to my love for you.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.002
Okay, you're free to go.

20:48.169 --> 20:50.131
Spread your legs and fly.

20:50.297 --> 20:53.300
You are some of the best hos
I've ever had.

20:53.467 --> 20:57.972
It's true. It's true.
Look at me. Look at me. You are.

20:58.514 --> 21:00.892
Daniela, I was tougher on you
than all the rest...

21:01.059 --> 21:03.186
...but that's because I believed in you.

21:03.353 --> 21:07.941
And now look. You have become
one of the skankiest hos...

21:08.108 --> 21:11.653
...I have ever had the privilege
to throw out of a moving car.

21:12.780 --> 21:15.658
Now go. Go.

21:17.660 --> 21:21.247
They're gonna be okay.
They're gonna be okay.

21:21.414 --> 21:26.003
So your mother and I are remarried and
I think we're stronger for it, aren't we?

21:26.170 --> 21:29.006
- Not really. I'm still pissed off.
- It's about the journey.

21:29.173 --> 21:31.133
So where's all our stuff?

21:31.300 --> 21:33.510
Joanna got half of everything
in the divorce.

21:33.677 --> 21:35.138
She is one vindictive...

21:35.305 --> 21:39.184
No. No, no. I'm not gonna be that guy
who's always bagging on his ex.

21:39.350 --> 21:41.102
And Steve's where?

21:41.269 --> 21:44.189
Joanna got joint custody.
We get him every other weekend.

21:47.818 --> 21:50.487
So do you have a TV?

21:50.654 --> 21:52.740
No.

22:32.659 --> 22:34.744
