of a live studio audience.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.300
Owen, calm down.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.386
I'm just a little tense

00:11.469 --> 00:13.930
{\an3}because I've got something
big to tell my mom.

00:14.013 --> 00:15.557
I'm getting married.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.809
Congratulations!

00:17.892 --> 00:20.103
Who's the lucky guy?

00:22.021 --> 00:24.607
Guy?
Elka, I'm not gay.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.192
Huh.

00:28.027 --> 00:31.322
I have a son...with a woman.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.533
Whatever.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.244
{\an3}The thing is,
you know how my mom

00:36.327 --> 00:38.288
and her friends
do crazy stuff?

00:38.371 --> 00:40.123
I just want to make sure
they don't embarrass me

00:40.206 --> 00:41.791
at the wedding.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.626
Hi, Owen.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.341
{\an3}Bob and I are going undercover
at a swingers' sex club.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.469
{\an1}Yeah, today we're not
Mom and Bob.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.804
We're Julie and Stash.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.308
Owen, are you okay?

00:58.391 --> 00:59.476
Is something wrong?

00:59.559 --> 01:01.478
I got engaged to Andrea.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.521
That's fantastic!

01:03.605 --> 01:06.149
Ow!

01:06.232 --> 01:08.651
{\an1}What can I do to help?
Name it; it's done.

01:08.735 --> 01:12.030
{\an3}Well, Andi's parents
are a little conservative,

01:12.113 --> 01:15.033
{\an3}so could you and your friends
not make a scene at the wedding?

01:15.116 --> 01:17.660
Okay, got it, no scenes.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.661
[bird squawks]

01:18.745 --> 01:20.997
Oh, hi, Owen.
This is Barry.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.666
My ex-husband, Clark,
is on expedition in Africa,

01:23.750 --> 01:26.002
so I have custody of our parrot
for a while.

01:26.085 --> 01:28.046
Victoria, wonderful news.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.339
Owen's getting married.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.508
Oh, congratulations.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.301
(Barry)
Oh, congratulations.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.512
He repeats everything
he hears.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.640
Joy's too old
for leather shorts.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.813
{\an1}Oh, good, somebody lend me
20 bucks so I can pay the cab.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.022
I'll explain
in a minute.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.273
{\an1}Thanks.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.361
[knock at door]

01:51.444 --> 01:54.989
{\an3}I have a summons
for Elka Ostrovsky.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.408
You were seen speeding

01:57.492 --> 01:58.868
down Euclid Avenue
shooting paintballs

01:58.952 --> 02:01.162
at women in fur coats.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.498
That was not me.

02:03.581 --> 02:04.999
We have your driver,
Mamie Sue Johnson's

02:05.083 --> 02:06.334

02:06.417 --> 02:09.670
My wheel man squealed.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.009
Okay, so I meet this great guy
last night,

02:15.093 --> 02:16.219
and I stay at his place.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.387
And then
he has to leave early,

02:17.470 --> 02:18.888
so I go outside
to get the newspaper,

02:18.972 --> 02:21.057
and then the door locks
behind me.

02:21.140 --> 02:22.892
Lucky me, it's trash day,
so I just made a dress

02:22.976 --> 02:24.602
out of this trash bag.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.479
But don't look in the back;
there's a weird hole.

02:26.563 --> 02:27.856
Weird hole?

02:30.316 --> 02:33.278
{\an1}Well, Owen, I see now why
you might be a little worried

02:33.361 --> 02:36.364
that Joy and her friends will
embarrass you at the wedding.

02:36.447 --> 02:37.824
{\an1}Wedding?
You're getting married?

02:37.907 --> 02:40.618
Oh, yay! Yay, oh.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.036
Is your father coming?

02:42.120 --> 02:43.705
{\an3}Uh, no,
I tried to reach him,

02:43.788 --> 02:46.249
{\an3}but he's embedded
in Afghanistan.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.751
{\an3}Bob, I was wondering
if you wanted to give the toast

02:48.835 --> 02:50.253
at the rehearsal dinner.

02:50.336 --> 02:53.423
Give the toast?

02:53.506 --> 02:55.425
[tearfully]
Well, I'd--I'd love to.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.221
Oh, no.
I'm ruining my sex makeup.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.952
{\an8}Everything is perfect.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.245
{\an8}I got the cake.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.247
{\an8}Ooh, how did it turn out?

03:26.331 --> 03:28.917
{\an9}You know how Owen's fiancée
wanted a fairy tale-themed cake

03:29.000 --> 03:30.585
{\an8}with a castle and turrets?

03:30.668 --> 03:32.295
{\an8}I'm sure it's fine.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.588
{\an9}I'm probably seeing something
that's not even there.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.307
{\an8}Oh, my God.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.476
{\an8}I was excited to see the cake,

03:46.559 --> 03:49.479
{\an8}but it looks like the cake
is excited to see me.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.316
{\an8}Hello, everyone.

{\an8}Barry!

04:00.907 --> 04:02.825
{\an8}Okay, fine.

04:02.909 --> 04:06.037
{\an7}Last night, I watched a movie
called <i> Hung Like a Horse.</i>

04:06.120 --> 04:07.246
{\an8}I thought it was gonna be
a Western,

04:07.330 --> 04:10.166
{\an8}but it turned out to be porn.

04:10.249 --> 04:12.502
{\an8}How long did you watch it
before you figured it out?

04:12.585 --> 04:14.170

What's wrong with the cak--

04:20.927 --> 04:23.179
holy crap!

04:24.263 --> 04:25.556
Cover that thing up.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.058
Andi and her parents
are right behind me.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.188
Uh-oh.

04:32.271 --> 04:34.816
Hello. You must be Andi.
I'm Joy.

04:34.899 --> 04:35.817
{\an3}Oh!

04:35.900 --> 04:38.569
Great to meet you, Joy.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.154
Oh, your hands are so soft.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.535
{\an1}Yours are so soft too.
What's your secret?

04:45.618 --> 04:47.662
I'm 28?

04:49.497 --> 04:51.708
Mom, these are Andi's parents,
Gerald and Maureen.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.042
It's a pleasure.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.210
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

04:54.293 --> 04:55.712
{\an1}And these are
my mom's friends.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.547
There's Melanie and--

04:57.630 --> 04:59.298
and Elka.

05:00.883 --> 05:03.720
Excuse me.
Is that real fur?

05:03.803 --> 05:05.847
{\an3}Of course.
I'd never wear faux.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.557
So tacky, right?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.642
Super tacky.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.523
See you tonight
at the big party.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.692
Tonight at the big party.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.700
Did you see that fur coat?

05:25.783 --> 05:29.704
Why didn't I bring
my paintball gun?

05:29.787 --> 05:31.122
Victoria?

05:33.624 --> 05:35.585
Why did you dive
under the table?

05:35.668 --> 05:38.379
I don't remember.
No reason.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.881
Okay,
we have a bigger problem.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.924
I was on the elevator with Andi
a little while ago.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.551
I didn't know it was her,

05:43.634 --> 05:44.802
and I overheard her
telling her mom

05:44.886 --> 05:46.220
that she's got cold feet.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.430
What if she's calling off
the wedding?

05:47.513 --> 05:48.639
What are we gonna do?

05:48.723 --> 05:51.059
{\an3}Absolutely nothing,
that's what.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.518
Plenty of brides get cold feet.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.145
It's perfectly normal.

05:54.228 --> 05:57.315
We are not going to get involved
and risk embarrassing Owen.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.775
{\an3}Agreed.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.569
Do you know where
the nearest paint store is?

06:04.363 --> 06:05.782
{\an1}So, honey, you still
want to go shoe shopping

06:05.865 --> 06:07.241
before the ceremony?

06:07.325 --> 06:08.451
No, I'll wear the sandals.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.244
They go with my dress,

06:10.328 --> 06:12.371
{\an3}and I'm not really worried
about having cold feet anymore.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.126
Sweetheart, your flight
got in early.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.503
[upbeat]
Mm-hmm.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.381
How about I come join you?

Mm-hmm.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.105
{\an3}Hello, Joy.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.481
What are you doing here?

06:38.564 --> 06:39.857
Our son's getting married.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.484
{\an1}But you're supposed to be
in Afghanistan.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.111
I know.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.821
{\an3}I thought about the whole
surprising-you-in-bed thing

06:44.904 --> 06:47.323
{\an3}on the flight over,
and it worked.

06:47.406 --> 06:48.324
You seem surprised.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.284
{\an1}No, Simon.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.161
I'm with someone else now.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.664
It's Mitch, isn't it,
that handsome devil?

06:54.747 --> 06:56.290
{\an1}No, it's not Mitch.
It's Bob.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.376
{\an3}[laughs]

07:01.629 --> 07:03.339
{\an3}Seriously?

07:03.422 --> 07:05.675
I'm in love with Bob,

07:05.758 --> 07:08.344
{\an1}and he's more man
than you'll ever be.

07:08.427 --> 07:09.762
{\an3}You sure?

07:12.932 --> 07:13.975
Joy, surprise.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.477
{\an1}I brought fudge
from the airpo--oh.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.146
It's not what it looks like.

07:18.229 --> 07:22.024
{\an3}Bob, it's exactly
what it looks like.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.860
Simon, I don't know
what you're thinking,

07:23.943 --> 07:25.987
but Joy is my woman now,

07:26.070 --> 07:28.781
and if anyone's gonna be in bed
with her, it's gonna be me.

07:31.450 --> 07:32.869
Now, I suggest you leave.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.036
I'm not going anywhere.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.246
Oh, yes, you are.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.205
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.041
Stop it right now!

07:39.125 --> 07:41.711
I can only handle one of you
at a time.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.672
Mom?

07:44.755 --> 07:46.716
Owen.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.551
Look, your dad's here.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.388
And Bob.

07:52.471 --> 07:53.890
I can see that.

07:53.973 --> 07:58.060
I just came by to introduce you
to Reverend Matsuta,

07:58.144 --> 07:59.937
who will be officiating
our wedding.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.400
Oh, my.

08:10.489 --> 08:13.034
So typical of Simon
to appear without any warning.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.453
Well, the good news is,
Simon showing up

08:15.536 --> 08:17.288
makes anything else
that might go wrong

08:17.371 --> 08:19.415
seem so small.

08:19.498 --> 08:23.044
Why do you say that?

08:23.127 --> 08:26.881
{\an1}Okay, you know my job
was to pick up the wedding ring,

08:26.964 --> 08:30.426
and, well, you know how parrots
are attracted to shiny things?

08:30.509 --> 08:32.135
Barry ate the ring?

08:32.220 --> 08:33.554
{\an3}We're never gonna
get it back.

08:33.638 --> 08:34.931
Oh, don't worry.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.350
{\an1}Found the exact same ring,
same size

08:37.433 --> 08:38.976
at a pawn shop downtown.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.227
Andi will never know.

08:40.311 --> 08:43.313
Look, there's even
a nice inscription.

08:43.397 --> 08:46.442
{\an3}"United in Satan."
Victoria!

08:46.525 --> 08:50.488
Oh, I thought it said Santa.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.406
Melanie, Elka, guess what.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.282
Simon's back.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.992
Really?

08:55.076 --> 08:57.411
{\an1}Well, that makes
whatever else could go wrong now

08:57.495 --> 08:59.288
seem so small.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.290
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.917
Melanie, what did you do?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.335
I didn't do anything.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.420
Elka, on the other hand,

09:06.504 --> 09:08.464
snuck into Andi's mom's closet

09:08.548 --> 09:11.467
{\an1}to ruin her fur coat
with spray paint.

09:11.550 --> 09:14.178
But because it was so dark
in there, she accidentally

09:14.262 --> 09:17.390
{\an1}spray-painted the only other
white thing in the closet.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.311
{\an1}"Murder"?
Oh, my God.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.690
(Gerald)
Excuse me.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.651
Ladies,
have any of you seen Andi?

09:28.734 --> 09:30.861
My wife says she's a bundle
of nerves.

09:30.945 --> 09:31.862
Is that
my daughter's wedding dress?

09:31.946 --> 09:32.863
Can I take a little peek?

09:32.947 --> 09:34.115
What?

09:34.198 --> 09:36.701
No, no,
this is a wedding dress,

09:36.784 --> 09:39.287
but it's actually my dress
for the wedding.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.748
You're wearing a wedding dress
to the wedding?

09:44.208 --> 09:46.627
Now that I hear it,
it's a terrible idea.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.170
I'll wear something else.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.589
Disaster averted.
Thank you.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.512
{\an1}Victoria,
why do you keep hiding

09:56.596 --> 09:57.972
{\an1}every time
you see Andi's father?

09:58.055 --> 10:00.391
Hiding?
I'm not hiding.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.518
Women went under the table all
the time in <i> Hung Like a Horse,</i>

10:02.601 --> 10:03.978
and no one said anything.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.986
{\an1}Whatever head game
you're playing, stop it now.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.988
{\an1}Elka, keep your fur politics
to yourself.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.365
And, Melanie,
fix the cake.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.575
I'll take this
to the hotel cleaners

10:17.658 --> 10:19.368
and see if they can repair it.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.995
Oh, poor Joy.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.538
{\an1}I wish there was something
we could do

10:22.621 --> 10:23.873
to make up for our mistakes.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.708
Cold feet, cold feet.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.210
Barry's right!
Andi's cold feet.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.046
Her dad even said
that she's got the jitters.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.839
{\an1}She's definitely thinking
of calling off this wedding.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.717
{\an1}We could really help Joy
by talking to Andi

10:34.800 --> 10:37.219
{\an1}and calming her down
and easing her through it.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.222
But Joy told us
not to get involved.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.141
Yes, she did.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.685
{\an1}I had a lot
of wedding jitters,

10:44.769 --> 10:46.062
but I went through with it,

10:46.145 --> 10:48.064
and it worked out just fine.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.733
{\an1}Of course, I did
get divorced, you know,

10:50.816 --> 10:53.778
{\an1}but our marriage
had the stress of children.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.696
Owen already has a child.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.281
Right.

10:57.365 --> 11:02.620
{\an1}Andi, I know a little
about pre-wedding nerves.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.413
I've been married six times.

11:04.497 --> 11:08.876
Seven, if you count my marriage
to your future mother-in-law.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.544
You were married to Joy?

11:10.628 --> 11:13.464
Never consummated.

11:13.547 --> 11:17.885
{\an1}I just want you to know,
I do believe Owen is straight.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.764
You thought Owen was gay?

11:21.847 --> 11:23.557
Totally.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.060
But that shouldn't even
enter your mind.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.312
- It didn't.
- Don't let it.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.774
Jerry, no one
can know about us,

11:31.857 --> 11:33.442
especially
at your daughter's wedding.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.568
{\an1}(Gerald)
But I don't know how long

11:34.652 --> 11:36.570
{\an1}I can keep this secret
from my wife.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.656
{\an3}Well, but if she finds out,
then the press will find out,

11:38.739 --> 11:40.616
and then it'll be everywhere.

11:40.699 --> 11:42.952
Okay.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.329
{\an3}Thank you.
You are a dear, sweet man.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.414
I could kiss you right now.

11:46.497 --> 11:47.415
{\an1}[chuckles]

11:49.083 --> 11:51.627
{\an1}And surely you understand
why this has to be a secret.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.838
{\an1}I mean, if people find out
we went to high school together,

11:53.921 --> 11:55.798
{\an1}they'll figure out
my true age.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.008
{\an3}But your friends
must know your true age.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.804
{\an1}They know a true age,
not the true age.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.975
Oh, damn it, you're dressed.

12:07.685 --> 12:10.521
Simon, you can't keep
barging into my room.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.481
And why are you wearing a kilt?

12:12.565 --> 12:15.109
It's for the rehearsal dinner.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.485
That's another thing
you and I have in common:

12:16.569 --> 12:19.697
we both have the legs
to pull off a skirt.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.199
Stop flirting with me.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.993
You can't charm your way
back into my life.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.661
I'm with someone else now.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.705
I plan to change that.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.166
{\an1}Tonight I'm gonna
make a toast to first love,

12:30.249 --> 12:32.001
{\an1}like Owen and Andi,
like you and me.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.002
Simon--

12:33.085 --> 12:34.628
Joy, we're a family.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.880
What more could a boy want

12:35.963 --> 12:37.298
{\an1}than his parents
to get back together?

12:37.381 --> 12:40.509
{\an1}Let's make this
a perfect wedding for our son.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.719
[phone chirps]

12:41.802 --> 12:43.179
Oh, damn it!

12:43.262 --> 12:44.555
{\an3}The dry cleaner
can't get "murder"

12:44.638 --> 12:45.848
out of the wedding dress.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.850
- What?
- Never mind.

12:47.933 --> 12:48.893
I've got to go down there.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.772
Simon.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.903
{\an1}Bob.

12:58.986 --> 13:01.363
Are you coloring your hair?

13:01.447 --> 13:03.866
That's not important.

13:03.949 --> 13:08.162
What is important is, I heard
everything you said to Joy,

13:08.245 --> 13:10.206
and I think
you're absolutely right.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.874
You do?

13:11.957 --> 13:14.585
{\an3}Yes,
you're her first love.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.253
{\an3}She's never gonna
get over that.

13:16.337 --> 13:20.007
{\an3}It's time for me to accept
that fact and move on.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.885
{\an3}I'm gonna get dressed
and get out of Joy's life.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.346
Oh, one more thing.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.931
Owen's wedding ring

13:27.014 --> 13:28.766
{\an3}is in the pocket
of my suit in that closet.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.392
Why don't you get it?

13:30.476 --> 13:32.728
{\an3}You should be the one
to present it at the wedding.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.272
Sure.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.774
And thank you.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.407
[pounding on door]

13:45.491 --> 13:46.408
Hey, what's going on?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.373
And I'd like to thank my mom

13:52.456 --> 13:55.876
for a wonderful, uneventful
evening.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.253
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.671
I guess all that's left
is the cake.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.756
The cake is fine, right?

14:00.839 --> 14:02.091
Don't worry.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.592
{\an1}I was very explicit
with the baker.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.762
I told him absolutely
no penis on this cake.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.729
{\an3}Oh, my.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.400
{\an3}There's "absolutely no penis"
on this cake.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.529
I miss them too.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.451
{\an3}No, that's what it says
on the cake:

14:29.535 --> 14:32.329
"absolutely no penis."

14:36.875 --> 14:37.918
Mom?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.628
{\an1}No, no, no, no, honey,
I can explain.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.172
See, the first cake
was a fairy tale cake

14:42.256 --> 14:43.674
with a castle and turrets

14:43.757 --> 14:45.926
{\an3}that looked like,
well, penises.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.430
{\an3}But I told the baker
on this cake,

14:49.513 --> 14:50.681
absolutely no penis,

14:50.764 --> 14:52.474
and he, you know,
took me literally.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.061
Well, Reverend,
I suppose there's nothing sinful

14:56.145 --> 14:57.563
about eating a cake like that.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.106
Just the calories.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.441
[laughter]

15:02.443 --> 15:03.819
[glass dinging]

15:03.902 --> 15:05.863
Everyone, I know
Simon was planning

15:05.946 --> 15:07.323
to make the toast tonight,

15:07.406 --> 15:08.699
but he doesn't seem
to be here at the moment.

15:08.782 --> 15:12.328
I--I guess he had
something better to do,

15:12.411 --> 15:13.996
not to besmirch
the name of the man

15:14.079 --> 15:15.831
who knocked Joy up
as a teenager, left her,

15:15.914 --> 15:19.168
{\an1}and returned several times
just to break her heart again.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.544
But I digress.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.589
To love.

15:25.924 --> 15:28.677
{\an5}(Simon)
First love.
Here's to first love!

15:28.761 --> 15:29.970
Simon?

15:30.054 --> 15:31.221
Where are you?

15:31.305 --> 15:36.393
(Simon)
I'm up above in the air duct!

15:36.477 --> 15:38.145
Bob locked me in the closet,

15:38.228 --> 15:41.148
but I burst through the ceiling
and crawled my way over here.

15:41.231 --> 15:45.152
What a ridiculous story
from a ridiculous man.

15:45.235 --> 15:47.196
{\an1}You know,
on this happy occasion,

15:47.279 --> 15:49.531
it's hard not to think
of the great Canadian comedian

15:49.615 --> 15:52.701
Howard "Howie" Mandel.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.871
{\an5}(Simon)
Or the great Scottish poet
Shirley MacLaine, who said:

15:55.954 --> 15:58.540
[speaking Scottish Gaelic]

16:00.584 --> 16:04.254
Scottish?
Sounds like Klingon.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.343
Joy is mine now, Simon.

16:09.426 --> 16:10.552
She's never coming back to you.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.554
She'll be mine again, Bob.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.889
You wait and see.

16:13.972 --> 16:15.516
Stop it.

16:15.599 --> 16:16.725
You're ruining
the rehearsal dinner.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.019
It doesn't matter.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.729
There's not gonna be a wedding.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.232
Andi, what are you saying?

16:23.315 --> 16:25.901
Melanie and Victoria and Elka
came to my room this afternoon

16:25.984 --> 16:27.528
{\an3}and changed my mind
about getting married.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.364
- You what?
- Oh, no, Andi.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.282
We were reassuring you
that marriage is good,

16:32.366 --> 16:34.284
{\an1}because in the elevator,
you said you had cold feet.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.078
{\an3}What?

16:36.161 --> 16:37.246
{\an3}I was talking about
whether I should wear sandals

16:37.329 --> 16:39.581
{\an3}with my wedding dress,
'cause my feet might be cold.

16:39.665 --> 16:44.294
[together]
Oh.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.423
Owen, the other reason I can't
go through with the wedding is,

16:47.506 --> 16:49.091
how can I believe in marriage

16:49.174 --> 16:51.427
{\an3}when my own father is
having an affair with Victoria?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.387
[together]
What?

16:53.470 --> 16:54.763
Don't deny it.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.432
I overheard you two whispering
in the hall.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.100
(Gerald)
Oh, no, sweetheart.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.437
We're not--we are not
having an affair.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.814
Victoria and I were whispering

17:03.897 --> 17:05.523
because we went
to high school together,

17:05.607 --> 17:07.151
and she was begging me

17:07.233 --> 17:09.944
not to tell everyone
that we graduated in 19--

17:14.074 --> 17:15.784
Well, nice scene, Mom.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.618
You promised
you wouldn't embarrass me.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.704
I'm sorry, Owen.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.664
But this time, I'm gonna fix it.

17:20.748 --> 17:24.334
Everyone, sit down
and be quiet.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.130
Andi, you're getting married
tomorrow,

17:28.213 --> 17:30.132
because you love my son.

17:30.215 --> 17:34.219
But no wedding is perfect,
because love isn't perfect.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.639
Tomorrow your dress
is going to say "murder" on it.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.733
And your wedding band
will read, "United in Satan."

17:51.653 --> 17:54.364
But none of that matters,
because you're in love,

17:54.448 --> 17:56.533
and people who are in love
should get married.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.829
Which is why I'm not
marrying you, Simon.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.997
I'm marrying Bob.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.832
- You are?
- You are?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.250
You are?

18:06.543 --> 18:08.378
Yes, I am.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.130
Is this a proposal?

18:10.214 --> 18:11.131
No!

18:11.215 --> 18:13.175
Yes.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.135
{\an1}Well, then let's
do this right.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.472
{\an1}Joy...

18:18.555 --> 18:20.849
you're the most amazing woman
I've ever met.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.019
I love you, and I always will,

18:24.102 --> 18:26.855
and I wish I had a ring

18:26.939 --> 18:28.774
{\an1}to put on your beautiful
finger right now.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.067
[bird squawks]

18:30.150 --> 18:30.984
[ring clatters]

18:36.156 --> 18:41.870
{\an1}Well, seems the bride's
real ring has been...released.

18:43.121 --> 18:45.207
So I can give you this one.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.751
Joy, will you marry me?

18:47.835 --> 18:50.379
Oh, Bob, yes.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.714
[applause]

18:58.303 --> 19:00.097
Congratulations.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.808
{\an3}Speaking of weddings,
can we get back to mine?

19:04.268 --> 19:06.228
Does this mean
that there might be one?

19:06.311 --> 19:07.563
Yes.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.231
Oh, thank God,

19:09.314 --> 19:10.899
{\an1}because even though my mom
and her friends

19:10.983 --> 19:12.276
will always be around

19:12.359 --> 19:16.780
and no one will be more insane
than they are,

19:16.864 --> 19:19.449
no one will ever love you
more than I do.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.785
I love you too, Owen.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.918
Hung like a horse.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.759
Oh, my.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.438
Are you okay?

19:49.521 --> 19:52.733
I will be.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.067
Joy'll be happy with Bob.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.903
He's a good guy.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.738
{\an3}He is.

19:57.821 --> 20:00.282
And so are you.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.827
{\an1}Thank you.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.747
{\an1}Well, I guess I better get
in touch with the front desk

20:06.830 --> 20:08.790
and see about getting a room.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.127
{\an3}Well, I've got
plenty of room here.
