00:22.773 --> 00:24.817
At the turn of the 20th century,

00:24.858 --> 00:27.067
the world got hooked on occultism.

00:27.069 --> 00:28.821
And Russia was no exception.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.824
Spiritualist salons were
especially in demand.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.830
Dear Baron, I don't know what to say.

00:38.789 --> 00:41.792
My husband looked so alive. I touched him.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.045
You and your colleague are
doing incredible things.

00:45.796 --> 00:46.589
That's science.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.799
It will erase the border between worlds,

00:48.841 --> 00:50.799
just as it's erasing the distances.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.803
I promise you that.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.806
So death no longer means parting?

00:58.809 --> 00:59.810
Go.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.104
Thank you, Baron.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.280
Here's your fee for today's seance.

01:13.824 --> 01:14.825
I can't do it.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.828
Today was my last time.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.498
All right, I can give you more.

01:20.831 --> 01:21.832
How much?

01:25.836 --> 01:27.755
No, I don't want money.

01:30.841 --> 01:31.842
Listen to me,

01:32.843 --> 01:35.051
I don't think you fully understand

01:35.053 --> 01:36.889
the importance of our work.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.848
We haven't started all this

01:39.850 --> 01:42.851
just so some rich desperate widows

01:42.853 --> 01:46.857
could talk to their deceased husbands.

01:48.859 --> 01:49.860
We have opened

01:50.861 --> 01:52.863
a gateway to the world of the dead.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.866
And it's more important than

01:56.867 --> 01:58.869
discovery of America.

02:01.872 --> 02:02.873
It wasn't a ghost.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.291
What?

02:05.626 --> 02:06.877
They were never ghosts.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.838
They were demons, fiends.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.882
Dear God, what have we done?

02:12.883 --> 02:14.883
We have opened a door for them.

02:14.885 --> 02:15.884
Dear Lord, save and protect us!

02:15.886 --> 02:16.887
Stop it!

02:17.888 --> 02:19.888
Stop this nonsense right now!

02:19.890 --> 02:21.892
Have mercy on us, sinners.

02:25.896 --> 02:26.897
You don't understand.

02:29.733 --> 02:30.901
You don't understand.

02:31.902 --> 02:32.901
He's still here.

02:32.903 --> 02:33.904
Here?

02:39.577 --> 02:41.745
He's here.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.171
I want to talk

02:52.923 --> 02:53.924
to him.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.293
GUESTS

04:38.028 --> 04:39.027
Oh.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.030
I overslept.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.074
The place is empty anyway.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.035
Why didn't you come yesterday?

04:46.036 --> 04:47.037
It was really fun.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.037
Nah.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.040
I couldn't make it.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.040
For sure.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.043
As always.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.046
I mean it. I couldn't make it.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.054
Have you made a choice?

05:06.056 --> 05:07.057
No, not this.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.894
Miss, are you in a hurry?

05:11.061 --> 05:13.061
That's a pretty nice place, you like it?

05:13.063 --> 05:14.062
I guess it is.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.063
Stop, they have bouncers.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.064
What are you talking about?

05:16.066 --> 05:18.068
Here. Sit down, baby.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.071
These are mine.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.072
Hello guys!

05:24.074 --> 05:25.073
Oh, hello.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.076
Miss?

05:26.409 --> 05:27.035
Yes?

05:27.077 --> 05:28.076
So, I'll have...

05:28.078 --> 05:29.079
We have a delicious dessert.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.082
Tell me, please, do you
have any strong drinks?

05:37.379 --> 05:38.421
They are from Moscow.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.089
And they are having a
mega cool party tonight.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.093
They are organizers or something.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.803
See the guy with a tattoo?

05:44.845 --> 05:47.055
That's Nikita. He's so freaking awesome!

05:47.097 --> 05:49.099
Katya, I'm dying! We have to go there!

05:51.393 --> 05:52.227
That guy!

05:52.269 --> 05:53.395
He's staring at you.

05:56.649 --> 05:57.357
I noticed.

05:58.108 --> 05:58.817
Katya!

05:59.109 --> 06:00.110
Give him a smile, will you?

06:01.111 --> 06:02.530
Come on, it's invitation-only.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.698
Seriously, how long are you gonna

06:04.740 --> 06:06.659
keep mourning that prince of yours?

06:07.325 --> 06:08.536
It's been half a year.

06:08.661 --> 06:10.245
He's not worth it.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.246
We were planning to set the prices higher.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.248
Set up a monitor for me and forget it.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.418
We need to get more sound.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.837
We don't have enough volume.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.717
Our Vadik seems to have
a crush on the waitress.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.054
The brunette?

06:28.138 --> 06:29.137
She's a cute one.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.140
What's your bet?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.141
He'll get too shy.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.142
I'm right here guys.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.145
Whoops.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.148
How would he handle her?
No buttons, no equalizer.

06:38.691 --> 06:39.399
Go to hell!

06:39.733 --> 06:40.734
All right, all right.

06:41.485 --> 06:42.611
We should help our baby.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.154
We surely will.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.157
Dearest Sasha,

06:47.908 --> 06:51.161
Tell me, what are you
doing tonight after work?

06:52.037 --> 06:52.705
Nothing.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.164
Wonderful.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.042
Guess what!

06:58.168 --> 07:00.170
They want us to show them the seaside.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.172
Wanna have a ride, you're in?

07:03.173 --> 07:04.174
Come on, let's go have some fun!

07:18.396 --> 07:19.187
Wow-wow-wow.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.650
Watch your step, carefully, watch you step.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.202
Woo, awesome!

07:34.204 --> 07:35.205
This is magical!

07:37.207 --> 07:39.209
Just look around, it's so beautiful!

07:44.006 --> 07:45.213
Don't fall behind!

07:45.215 --> 07:46.214
Don't make us wait!

07:46.216 --> 07:47.217
So are you coming tonight?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.176
Where?

07:49.219 --> 07:50.345
To, to the party.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.223
Or are you busy?

07:54.808 --> 07:55.643
I'm not.

07:56.226 --> 07:56.894
I'm free.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.230
Are you cold?

08:01.231 --> 08:02.230
Katya!

08:02.232 --> 08:03.275
They are calling for us.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.862
Fre-e-e-edo-o-o-om!

08:06.904 --> 08:08.238
Come on, faster!

08:11.241 --> 08:12.660
Hey, I don't wanna swim!

08:14.244 --> 08:15.078
Come on, back!

08:17.247 --> 08:18.248
It's so cold!

08:21.251 --> 08:22.252
Stop, not there!

08:27.257 --> 08:29.257
Did you see that house? Looks ancient.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.261
I bet it's empty.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.513
You wish!

08:33.263 --> 08:34.431
We got a party to throw.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.282
Katya!

08:54.284 --> 08:55.285
Come join us!

09:00.708 --> 09:01.834
Katya, here!

09:01.875 --> 09:02.460
Oh, thanks.

09:03.461 --> 09:04.294
So, do you like it?

09:06.296 --> 09:09.299
I didn't know this place
hosted events like this.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.303
I thought this was just
an abandoned factory.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.305
It doesn't host anything.

09:16.724 --> 09:17.641
You mean...

09:18.141 --> 09:19.101
This is illegal?

09:19.142 --> 09:20.310
That's the whole point.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.981
We firmly believe that drinking and dancing

09:24.314 --> 09:27.317
require no permission by
any kinds or authorities!

09:30.320 --> 09:32.320
It's so unbelievably cool!

09:32.322 --> 09:33.323
I know, right?

09:33.616 --> 09:34.658
I want selfie!

09:36.326 --> 09:37.453
Over here!

10:12.362 --> 10:14.364
Well, aren't we awesome!

10:15.365 --> 10:17.576
This is the best party I've ever been to!

10:18.368 --> 10:19.662
Actually, this is mass market.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.622
We keep the best for ourselves.

10:21.789 --> 10:22.873
What do we keep?

10:22.915 --> 10:24.124
The best of the best of the best!

10:24.374 --> 10:25.375
We don't have anything.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.335
Well, the girls are local.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.378
They can help.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.378
What do you need?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.925
Well, the thing is, we like to pay

10:32.966 --> 10:33.884
Visits.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.220
Visits to very special
places, with no hosts.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.388
You want to break into someone's house?

10:40.390 --> 10:42.392
Nothing bad. Just a house party.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.394
We don't steal. And we clean up afterwards.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.396
But we need a special house.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.774
Like the one on the beach.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.400
Where you worked in over the summer.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.404
Sasha told us everything already.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.500
This is not up for discussion.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.418
You couldn't keep your mouth shut?

11:09.419 --> 11:10.418
But it's a perfect option!

11:10.420 --> 11:12.921
Your mysterious prince
left long ago anyway.

11:12.923 --> 11:13.922
And you know the place.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.008
I said no.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.427
Katya, you brought us
to his house yourself.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.429
You have a problem. And
it needs to be fixed.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.976
How exactly? By going to that house?

11:24.059 --> 11:25.060
Great idea!

11:26.019 --> 11:27.938
Not just going, Katya. Going with Vadik.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.107
Scientists have proven that

11:30.148 --> 11:31.484
repressing bad memories is good.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.444
Katya, when are you gonna
stop torturing yourself?

11:34.528 --> 11:36.404
You like that Vadik, do you?

11:36.446 --> 11:37.445
You do.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.449
First time you even look at someone else.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.453
You're smiling again. So give it a chance.

13:28.559 --> 13:30.561
Crimean Gothic in all its beauty.

13:35.273 --> 13:35.899
Wow!

13:36.358 --> 13:36.984
Cool!

13:39.570 --> 13:41.570
I'd like to remind you
not to post anything.

13:41.572 --> 13:42.573
Why?

13:43.574 --> 13:45.576
Do you want us to get busted?

14:16.607 --> 14:17.691
So who is the owner?

14:18.609 --> 14:19.610
He's an architect.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.612
He's pretty well off, that architect.

14:21.945 --> 14:22.613
Yeah.

14:49.640 --> 14:50.641
It's the bottom lock.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.641
They never used the top one.

14:52.643 --> 14:55.479
Wait! You said he lives there alone.

14:55.646 --> 14:56.647
They died.

14:57.648 --> 14:58.649
His wife and kid.

14:59.650 --> 15:00.358
Here?

15:01.652 --> 15:04.112
No. In a car crash.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.596
Well, to quote a classic,

15:28.679 --> 15:31.680
the beauty of country
life is in its informality.

15:31.682 --> 15:32.683
Brilliant!

16:08.719 --> 16:10.137
That's a neat place!

16:10.721 --> 16:12.556
Look at the fireplace!

16:14.725 --> 16:15.601
Shall we start it?

16:15.726 --> 16:16.560
Sure.

16:39.291 --> 16:40.083
Sorry!

16:40.751 --> 16:42.709
One hell of a place but if you ask me,

16:42.711 --> 16:44.421
there's a little much of this...

16:45.088 --> 16:47.132
...atmospheric decrepitude.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.757
And one of the doors doesn't open.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.469
Probably stuck.

16:51.762 --> 16:52.763
It's damp.

17:08.570 --> 17:09.780
Maybe let's blow?

17:13.784 --> 17:14.785
There's no draft.

17:17.788 --> 17:18.789
Maybe there's a heater?

18:03.834 --> 18:04.835
Sorry.

18:05.836 --> 18:06.837
I'm just looking for a heater.

18:07.838 --> 18:10.132
They should be under the stairs.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.133
Thanks

18:36.534 --> 18:37.868
I say!

19:08.899 --> 19:09.900
Put it back now.

19:10.901 --> 19:11.902
You know the rules.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.147
What's that book?

19:49.397 --> 19:51.942
A Study of Demonic Entities.

19:53.944 --> 19:55.944
Nikolai Karlovich von Grubbe.

19:55.946 --> 19:56.947
That's our house.

20:03.954 --> 20:05.956
That's quite a freak show.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.001
This part is awesome.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.964
All the sketches presented in the book

20:14.965 --> 20:17.801
were made by the author during his

20:18.802 --> 20:20.804
visionary revelations.

20:21.972 --> 20:22.973
Like, they were posing?

20:30.981 --> 20:32.315
What were they smoking back then?

20:33.984 --> 20:34.985
Great question.

21:46.056 --> 21:49.057
You think Her Majesty will
deign to enter the kitchen?

21:49.059 --> 21:51.061
Or does she think she
hired free waitresses?

21:53.063 --> 21:54.397
You just want her boyfriend.

22:06.535 --> 22:09.077
You know, your fairy-tale
castle is in decay.

22:09.079 --> 22:10.247
There's mold everywhere.

22:28.682 --> 22:30.100
That's our dining room.

22:31.101 --> 22:32.100
Yeah.

22:32.102 --> 22:33.479
The Baron's in the middle.

22:34.104 --> 22:35.105
Let me.

22:43.071 --> 22:45.113
Baron von Grubbe. A famous
philologist and mystic.

22:45.115 --> 22:48.116
In the early 20th century,
his country house was known

22:48.118 --> 22:49.495
as the biggest spiritualist salon

22:49.537 --> 22:50.536
of the Crimean Riviera.

22:50.538 --> 22:52.205
He claimed that the Devil himself

22:52.247 --> 22:53.916
showed him the dwellers of Hell.

22:54.332 --> 22:55.375
Let me have a look.

22:58.128 --> 23:01.131
Died at a psychiatric hospital in Berlin.

23:03.467 --> 23:04.802
Damn.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.137
I almost believed it. Here.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.152
Who is this dude?

23:23.028 --> 23:24.154
I know him.

23:25.155 --> 23:26.239
It's Alexander Blok, idiot.

23:28.158 --> 23:29.409
Nikita, Nikita...

23:29.743 --> 23:30.578
Listen.

23:31.161 --> 23:33.914
The best people of that
time summoned spirits here.

23:34.081 --> 23:35.163
Why shouldn't we?

23:35.165 --> 23:37.167
We are also the best people.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.171
Seriously?

23:42.172 --> 23:44.174
A spiritualist seance?

23:46.176 --> 23:47.678
It's all pretty clear.

23:48.178 --> 23:49.177
So who are we calling?

23:49.179 --> 23:50.180
Pushkin.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.180
At least not Tsoi.

23:52.182 --> 23:55.183
Let's call the Baron. Pay
our respects to the host.

23:55.185 --> 23:58.355
Right! An insane ghost is
exactly what we are missing.

23:58.522 --> 23:59.187
Let's do it.

23:59.189 --> 24:00.190
Did you call me?

24:04.194 --> 24:05.193
Okay.

24:05.195 --> 24:07.155
Okay. Now we need a medium.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.281
Oh...

24:08.491 --> 24:09.950
Can I do it?

24:10.784 --> 24:11.619
Yeah?

24:20.293 --> 24:23.171
I am calling the spirit

24:24.214 --> 24:25.257
of Baron von Grubbe.

24:28.552 --> 24:29.887
All right, all right, it's me.

24:38.145 --> 24:42.232
I am calling the spirit
of Baron von Grubbe.

24:44.234 --> 24:48.781
I am calling the spirit
of Baron von Grubbe.

24:53.243 --> 24:55.245
Baron von Grubbe, if you are here,

24:56.246 --> 24:57.330
give us a sign.

25:09.259 --> 25:10.969
Must be the shutters.

25:13.263 --> 25:15.263
Listen, this is not funny anymore.

25:15.265 --> 25:16.266
Quiet.

25:21.271 --> 25:22.272
There's someone in the house.

25:50.801 --> 25:53.303
Let's assume you got the wrong address.

25:57.307 --> 25:58.433
All right, all right.

25:59.768 --> 26:03.313
We're coming out. We're all coming out.

26:04.314 --> 26:05.440
Move it guys.

26:05.774 --> 26:08.235
See, we are moving along, nice and fast.

26:08.318 --> 26:10.318
This is embarrassing.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.319
Get out of here!

26:11.321 --> 26:14.322
Look, we thought the house was empty.

26:14.324 --> 26:15.826
We are not some thieves or hobos.

26:16.326 --> 26:19.329
I don't care about you. Out!

26:20.330 --> 26:22.124
I won't call the police.

26:24.585 --> 26:25.335
Why?

26:25.544 --> 26:26.294
Nikita!

26:26.336 --> 26:27.335
No, no, no.

26:27.337 --> 26:28.088
I'm serious.

26:28.130 --> 26:30.382
Why haven't you called the
police several hours ago?

26:31.341 --> 26:32.801
You don't understand.

26:33.343 --> 26:35.343
Did he not hear us?

26:35.345 --> 26:37.347
How long have we been here?

26:38.348 --> 26:40.348
Look at him! He's high as shit!

26:40.350 --> 26:41.349
Calm down!

26:41.351 --> 26:42.352
He's barely standing.

26:43.353 --> 26:46.356
What makes you think he's the owner?

26:48.358 --> 26:49.357
The house is boarded up.

26:49.359 --> 26:50.360
Where's Katya?

27:05.375 --> 27:07.375
Get out of here!

27:07.377 --> 27:08.376
All right, all right.

27:08.378 --> 27:09.377
Get out!

27:09.379 --> 27:10.378
Can I grab my things?

27:10.380 --> 27:11.379
Easy, easy.

27:11.381 --> 27:12.382
Get out of here!

27:12.424 --> 27:13.425
Easy, easy.

27:14.593 --> 27:16.384
Take it easy. We're going.

27:16.386 --> 27:17.262
Out.

27:22.768 --> 27:23.602
Nikita!

27:32.402 --> 27:33.236
Alive?

27:34.404 --> 27:35.405
I keep it at minimum.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.419
Where did he even come from?

27:57.427 --> 27:58.428
So is he the owner?

28:03.433 --> 28:04.434
No.

28:05.435 --> 28:06.687
That's what I told you.

28:08.063 --> 28:09.064
He's some hobo.

28:09.439 --> 28:11.441
It's low season, so he broke in.

28:13.443 --> 28:14.442
What if he talks?

28:14.444 --> 28:15.443
He won't remember any of this.

28:15.445 --> 28:17.447
We'll just lock him up somewhere.

28:18.448 --> 28:19.449
In the cellar.

28:21.452 --> 28:22.536
That's a bit too harsh.

28:22.911 --> 28:23.912
What else can we do?

28:24.455 --> 28:26.457
He wakes up, he'll
start attacking us again.

28:46.977 --> 28:48.646
Hey, let's just get the hell out of here?

28:49.146 --> 28:49.980
What?

28:50.481 --> 28:51.482
This is all...

28:52.483 --> 28:54.483
Unbelievable. Seriously?

28:54.485 --> 28:57.486
We've arranged such a
romantic setup for you,

28:57.488 --> 28:59.488
and you wanna bail?

28:59.490 --> 29:04.495
No, no, no. Come on. Come
on, come on. Katya's waiting.

29:16.507 --> 29:17.508
Careful.

29:22.513 --> 29:24.515
Damn it. Put him down.

29:27.518 --> 29:28.519
That's not human.

29:34.316 --> 29:36.527
Hey, don't forget to tuck him in.

29:37.152 --> 29:38.529
You want him to freeze to death?

29:41.532 --> 29:43.534
Fine, I'll go find something.

30:12.563 --> 30:13.564
Mold everywhere.

30:14.565 --> 30:15.566
Didn't notice it before.

30:16.567 --> 30:17.566
Can you handle it?

30:17.568 --> 30:18.902
Yes, I have experience.

30:19.027 --> 30:21.154
And I need the money to pay for college.

30:31.582 --> 30:34.585
Here's the key to the bottom lock.

30:35.586 --> 30:37.505
The top one gets stuck all the time,

30:37.546 --> 30:38.631
so we don't use it.

30:42.259 --> 30:43.594
I don't use it.

30:47.848 --> 30:49.224
Let's go upstairs.

31:16.627 --> 31:18.253
Seriously, it's been half a year.

31:20.631 --> 31:21.590
You just need to accept it

31:21.632 --> 31:22.675
and move on with your life.

31:23.634 --> 31:24.635
Your life!

31:25.636 --> 31:27.054
Sometimes I think that the house

31:27.095 --> 31:28.681
started falling apart without her.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.642
I see them every day.

31:31.892 --> 31:33.727
I wake up, and everything is decaying

31:33.769 --> 31:34.770
and crumbling down.

31:36.647 --> 31:39.399
I say you should come back to Moscow.

31:41.485 --> 31:43.654
Or next time, I'll take you there by force.

33:05.736 --> 33:07.362
It looks like he was staying here.

33:10.658 --> 33:12.741
How could anyone stay
here? It's cold as hell.

33:12.743 --> 33:14.745
Just coming here to sleep?

33:19.750 --> 33:21.001
I think it's kinda cool.

33:22.753 --> 33:23.754
Summoners...

33:24.755 --> 33:25.756
of crazy ghosts.

33:30.343 --> 33:31.720
You know, we've never done it...

33:32.930 --> 33:33.972
in a haunted house.

34:43.416 --> 34:44.251
Boo!

34:45.835 --> 34:46.837
God damn it, Artur!

34:49.840 --> 34:50.839
Catch.

34:50.841 --> 34:51.842
I'm gonna go.

34:53.844 --> 34:54.844
Cold?

35:29.880 --> 35:31.840
This species of low-order demons

35:31.882 --> 35:33.882
dwell in the damp gloom of Hell.

35:33.884 --> 35:36.887
They're capable of inducing
sleep and colorful visions,

35:37.471 --> 35:38.931
while luring human souls

35:38.972 --> 35:40.933
and feeding on their suffering.

35:43.143 --> 35:43.977
Wait, wait.

35:44.895 --> 35:46.895
Despite their innate cowardice,

35:46.897 --> 35:48.649
these jackals of hell attack anyone

35:48.691 --> 35:50.358
who dares to stand in their way.

35:50.568 --> 35:51.902
Stop it.

35:52.903 --> 35:55.906
It used to be someone's favorite piece.

35:57.658 --> 35:58.492
Oops.

35:58.534 --> 35:59.535
I found this in the cellar.

36:00.911 --> 36:02.913
Nearly locked him up with it.

36:03.914 --> 36:04.915
Oh!

36:05.916 --> 36:06.917
Pretty nice!

36:12.923 --> 36:13.924
Alright.

36:14.925 --> 36:16.969
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

36:18.512 --> 36:19.346
Nick!

36:24.935 --> 36:25.936
Well.

36:26.937 --> 36:27.938
to force majeure.

36:29.482 --> 36:30.357
Clink!

36:33.944 --> 36:35.944
Well, let's continue the seance?

36:35.946 --> 36:38.947
To Hell with spiritualism, let's roll!

36:38.949 --> 36:39.783
Finally!

37:21.992 --> 37:23.994
I'm sorry. I thought
you've already finished.

37:24.995 --> 37:25.996
Almost.

37:33.003 --> 37:34.004
Do you see them?

37:38.008 --> 37:38.801
Where?

37:41.011 --> 37:43.013
Over there. Standing and watching.

37:52.022 --> 37:53.023
There's no one there.

38:01.031 --> 38:02.032
Andrey?

38:28.601 --> 38:29.977
Did you need something, Katya?

38:31.061 --> 38:35.065
Yes, I found this in the
nursery, behind stuffed toys.

38:36.066 --> 38:38.068
I'm not sure if I should throw this out.

38:40.070 --> 38:42.072
It's just my wife's mug.

38:45.075 --> 38:47.077
I guess he broke it and hid it.

38:51.081 --> 38:52.082
I was thinking...

38:54.084 --> 38:55.210
We could fix it.

38:57.087 --> 38:58.088
Why?

39:00.090 --> 39:01.091
As a memory.

39:03.677 --> 39:04.845
To keep from forgetting?

39:15.397 --> 39:17.107
Okay, give it to me.

39:18.108 --> 39:19.109
Shit.

39:19.860 --> 39:21.111
Damn it. I'm sorry.

39:22.655 --> 39:24.114
Hold this, hold this.

39:25.491 --> 39:26.492
Is it bad?

39:27.493 --> 39:28.326
No.

39:37.002 --> 39:38.879
Go, Katya. There's a...

39:40.005 --> 39:41.131
first-aid kit in the kitchen.

41:19.229 --> 41:20.436
Have you seen Katya?

41:20.438 --> 41:21.189
What?

41:21.231 --> 41:22.065
Have you seen Katya?

41:22.232 --> 41:23.025
No!

41:43.712 --> 41:44.547
Katya?

41:48.258 --> 41:49.259
I've been looking for you.

41:53.263 --> 41:54.347
So what happened?

41:56.183 --> 41:57.100
Nothing.

42:02.272 --> 42:04.191
I don't like this either.

42:04.274 --> 42:05.275
Let's leave.

42:07.069 --> 42:07.986
Katya!

44:15.405 --> 44:17.407
LEONIDOV, ANDREY NIKOLAEVICH

45:05.456 --> 45:07.374
I texted you that it's over.

45:07.625 --> 45:09.460
I don't need your services anymore.

45:10.461 --> 45:12.463
I'm sorry. I guess I
didn't get the message.

45:13.756 --> 45:15.464
Are you leaving already?

45:15.466 --> 45:17.468
It's still early August.

45:18.051 --> 45:19.094
I'm leaving.

45:20.471 --> 45:23.472
Can I come in, just to charge my phone?

45:23.474 --> 45:24.475
The battery's dead.

45:44.495 --> 45:47.498
Actually, I should admit, my phone is fine.

45:49.166 --> 45:50.876
Just don't interrupt me, please,

45:50.918 --> 45:52.545
or I won't be able to finish.

45:56.840 --> 45:58.258
I think that now...

45:59.510 --> 46:00.969
You shouldn't be alone.

46:03.514 --> 46:06.517
It's like you've buried
yourself together with them.

46:07.518 --> 46:08.517
I can see that.

46:08.519 --> 46:11.313
And if you allow me to stay

46:11.522 --> 46:12.521
by your side...

46:12.523 --> 46:13.524
Katya!

46:14.525 --> 46:15.526
No one,

46:16.527 --> 46:17.528
especially you,

46:18.529 --> 46:20.529
can be near me right now.

46:20.531 --> 46:23.532
No-no-no, you are
saying the wrong thing.

46:23.534 --> 46:24.535
I...

46:25.536 --> 46:26.537
I know that...

46:26.745 --> 46:27.996
I know you need me.

46:30.373 --> 46:31.374
I need you...

46:32.543 --> 46:33.418
as well.

46:48.559 --> 46:49.560
Go away.

46:54.397 --> 46:56.567
And never come back to this house.

47:06.577 --> 47:07.578
Andrey.

47:08.579 --> 47:09.580
This is Katya.

47:12.165 --> 47:13.584
Say something. I...

47:15.586 --> 47:17.588
I know you've recognized me.

47:20.591 --> 47:22.593
Are you okay down there?

47:23.343 --> 47:25.594
I'm sorry. I know it's a stupid question,

47:25.596 --> 47:27.598
and all of this is just horrible.

47:29.767 --> 47:30.768
Andrey!

47:34.605 --> 47:35.606
Andrey!

47:36.607 --> 47:38.526
Please say something.

47:39.610 --> 47:41.612
I'll find something to pry it open.

47:51.622 --> 47:52.873
Go away.

47:53.624 --> 47:54.625
Andrey.

48:07.638 --> 48:08.639
Go away.

48:09.640 --> 48:10.639
You can't...

48:10.641 --> 48:11.642
be here.

48:13.644 --> 48:14.645
Here's...

48:16.647 --> 48:17.606
death.

48:49.680 --> 48:50.679
No again?

48:50.681 --> 48:51.682
Enough already.

48:59.690 --> 49:00.691
Don't do this...

49:02.693 --> 49:03.694
Don't do that...

49:07.698 --> 49:08.699
That's fine by me!

49:11.702 --> 49:12.703
It's not like I care.

49:33.516 --> 49:34.725
Please, come with me.

49:35.726 --> 49:37.728
We need to open the cellar.

49:38.061 --> 49:39.605
How about you explain this first?

49:42.440 --> 49:43.734
Vadik, please, I...

49:44.442 --> 49:45.736
I don't know. I...

49:46.737 --> 49:48.446
I messed up.

49:51.742 --> 49:52.743
So he is the owner?

49:53.744 --> 49:56.745
This house has been boarded
up for several months.

49:56.747 --> 49:58.580
I didn't expect to see him here.

49:58.582 --> 49:59.500
But you recognized him?

49:59.667 --> 50:01.041
Something happened to him.

50:01.043 --> 50:02.795
We have to get him out of there.

50:03.754 --> 50:04.755
Do you two...

50:05.756 --> 50:06.757
have a story?

50:07.758 --> 50:08.759
I...

50:09.760 --> 50:10.759
What does it matter?

50:10.761 --> 50:13.762
Seriously? What a tiny unimportant detail.

50:13.764 --> 50:15.764
We broke into his house!

50:15.766 --> 50:16.767
Problems?

50:17.685 --> 50:18.767
We are leaving.

50:18.769 --> 50:20.771
This is the owner. And they had an affair.

50:22.690 --> 50:24.567
It's not like that, and...

50:24.775 --> 50:26.569
And none of this even matters.

50:26.735 --> 50:27.778
Holy crap!

50:33.534 --> 50:35.784
Wait! Something's going on in this house.

50:35.786 --> 50:38.119
It's not normal, the way
everything's falling apart.

50:38.121 --> 50:39.705
And the cellar with Andrey...

50:39.707 --> 50:41.790
I don't know how to explain it.

50:41.792 --> 50:43.792
It's called a neglected house.

50:43.794 --> 50:45.713
And your Andrey is a psycho.

50:45.796 --> 50:47.796
Katya, are you saying that's the guy?

50:47.798 --> 50:48.797
Where are you going?

50:48.799 --> 50:49.798
Didn't you get it?

50:49.800 --> 50:51.800
This is the owner. She lied.

50:51.802 --> 50:53.176
So what if he's the owner?

50:53.178 --> 50:54.680
He's locked up and napping.

50:54.805 --> 50:56.763
We'll go in the morning, as planned.

50:56.765 --> 50:57.766
You gonna lock her up too?

50:57.808 --> 50:58.892
You've got to listen to me!

50:58.934 --> 51:00.934
Maybe I should lock
you up with that Andrey.

51:00.936 --> 51:02.811
Hey, knock it off!

51:02.813 --> 51:04.815
Listen, sort it out with your girlfriend!

51:04.940 --> 51:05.816
Or is she?

51:06.358 --> 51:07.818
Maybe she's not yours anymore.

51:08.819 --> 51:09.820
This conversation's over.

51:11.572 --> 51:13.824
I came here to have fun,
and I intend to do so! Okay?

51:17.828 --> 51:18.829
Why so quiet?

51:22.833 --> 51:24.084
Vadik, I'm begging you!

51:25.836 --> 51:26.712
Katya.

51:27.796 --> 51:28.672
I got it all.

51:28.839 --> 51:30.841
Just stop making up nonsense!

52:26.897 --> 52:27.898
Hi there!

53:08.939 --> 53:09.940
What the hell?

53:10.941 --> 53:12.943
Hey, where did this ball come from?

53:43.098 --> 53:44.975
What kind of psycho would do this?

53:45.976 --> 53:46.975
That's enough.

53:46.977 --> 53:48.521
We're packing up and leaving.

53:51.064 --> 53:52.941
Where? Why are you freaking out?

53:52.983 --> 53:54.317
This is not funny anymore.

53:56.987 --> 53:58.989
Did she blind you or something?

53:59.907 --> 54:01.992
Look around! There's no party. It's over.

54:02.576 --> 54:03.867
That's for me to decide.

54:03.869 --> 54:05.621
You don't like it, call a taxi.

54:06.997 --> 54:07.998
Sasha!

54:09.542 --> 54:10.584
Do you want to go?

54:11.126 --> 54:12.002
Not really.

54:14.004 --> 54:15.005
Here we go then!

55:19.570 --> 55:20.445
Damn it.

55:21.071 --> 55:22.072
Where did he go?

56:11.121 --> 56:13.121
The subscriber is not available now.

56:13.123 --> 56:14.458
Please, try calling back later.

56:48.158 --> 56:49.159
Oh, crap!

56:50.160 --> 56:51.203
You really scared me.

56:53.163 --> 56:54.289
Are you lost or something?

57:38.208 --> 57:39.209
Occupied.

58:17.247 --> 58:18.248
Katya?

58:37.267 --> 58:39.267
The subscriber is not available now.

58:39.269 --> 58:41.271
Please, try calling back later.

01:00:08.358 --> 01:00:09.527
God damn it! You scared me!

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.361
Have you seen Artur?

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:14.031
No.

01:00:15.365 --> 01:00:17.242
Maybe he left with Polina?

01:00:17.785 --> 01:00:18.786
The cellar's open.

01:00:18.827 --> 01:00:19.868
What the heck?

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:20.871
Did you let him out?

01:00:21.914 --> 01:00:22.665
No.

01:01:12.506 --> 01:01:13.423
Sasha!

01:01:25.936 --> 01:01:27.395
What the hell is that?

01:01:27.437 --> 01:01:28.856
Quietly, leave now

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:42.745
Katya!

01:01:57.468 --> 01:01:58.469
What on earth was that?

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:00.471
Sasha?

01:02:05.017 --> 01:02:05.851
Let's go.

01:02:05.976 --> 01:02:07.060
Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:11.482 --> 01:02:13.484
Can someone explain to me what's going on?

01:02:23.494 --> 01:02:24.495
God damn.

01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:38.008
You don't understand.

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:40.218
They're gonna kill Andrey!
They're gonna kill him!

01:02:40.385 --> 01:02:41.510
Calm down. Easy.

01:02:41.512 --> 01:02:42.513
It's okay. Easy. Easy.

01:02:58.487 --> 01:02:59.863
I couldn't reach Polina.

01:03:01.323 --> 01:03:02.324
Not now.

01:03:02.533 --> 01:03:03.534
There's another car!

01:04:38.629 --> 01:04:39.672
Don't look!

01:05:10.661 --> 01:05:11.662
Get out of the car!

01:05:16.667 --> 01:05:17.668
Into the house!

01:05:52.703 --> 01:05:53.704
This isn't gonna help.

01:05:54.412 --> 01:05:55.704
We need more fire.

01:05:55.706 --> 01:05:56.705
They don't like fire.

01:05:56.707 --> 01:05:58.709
First thing they did was clog the chimney.

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:00.709
You know them well?

01:06:00.711 --> 01:06:01.754
Well enough.

01:06:04.715 --> 01:06:05.714
What are those creeps?

01:06:05.716 --> 01:06:07.300
Vadik, stop it.

01:06:07.801 --> 01:06:09.720
He knew about them from the start.

01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:11.720
And now everyone's dead.

01:06:11.722 --> 01:06:12.723
They're dead!

01:06:14.475 --> 01:06:15.726
No one invited you here.

01:06:20.272 --> 01:06:21.732
Why are you still alive?

01:06:24.527 --> 01:06:25.736
Because I brought them here.

01:06:32.743 --> 01:06:33.744
Now, listen to me!

01:06:34.202 --> 01:06:35.746
Your only chance is to stay here.

01:06:36.747 --> 01:06:37.746
Where it's warm.

01:06:37.748 --> 01:06:39.750
And burn anything you can find.

01:06:41.752 --> 01:06:42.751
You leave in the morning...

01:06:42.753 --> 01:06:44.753
when they are not so dangerous.

01:06:44.755 --> 01:06:45.756
Wanna help?

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:47.550
Get enough firewood.

01:06:53.764 --> 01:06:54.765
So they are

01:06:55.766 --> 01:06:56.767
Phantoms?

01:06:57.768 --> 01:06:58.769
Demons

01:07:00.771 --> 01:07:02.355
Who assumed the shape of my wife and son.

01:07:04.775 --> 01:07:05.984
Monsters from another world.

01:07:08.779 --> 01:07:09.780
So all of that is real?

01:07:11.782 --> 01:07:13.617
You still have doubts?

01:07:16.787 --> 01:07:17.788
He studied Hell.

01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:20.791
He found the door and left it open.

01:07:21.792 --> 01:07:23.794
When I bought the house,
I didn't believe it either.

01:07:24.795 --> 01:07:25.796
What do they want?

01:07:27.172 --> 01:07:28.006
Only me.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.301
You presented a danger to me,

01:07:31.343 --> 01:07:32.845
so they started killing you.

01:07:35.806 --> 01:07:37.808
Keep it. We need to make a torch.

01:07:41.812 --> 01:07:43.313
Did they kill before us?

01:07:45.774 --> 01:07:47.067
My friend tried to take me away.

01:07:50.529 --> 01:07:52.740
I didn't know their ways back then.

01:07:53.907 --> 01:07:55.699
After that, I locked the house,

01:07:55.701 --> 01:07:57.495
isolated myself from the world

01:07:58.829 --> 01:07:59.830
and learned how to live with them.

01:08:03.834 --> 01:08:05.836
Only I hadn't anticipated you.

01:08:26.313 --> 01:08:27.608
Keep the fire burning.

01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:29.401
You can leave in the morning.

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:32.819
Andrey, wait!

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:11.652
I'm gonna make some tea.

01:11:25.536 --> 01:11:26.326
Mommy!

01:11:26.328 --> 01:11:27.329
You wanna spin?

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.041
Come!

01:11:32.042 --> 01:11:33.043
Let me spin you!

01:11:34.044 --> 01:11:35.045
Hurray!

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:43.053
How many times more? I am dizzy!

01:11:47.057 --> 01:11:47.933
Andrey!

01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:52.062
Pass the ball!

01:11:55.065 --> 01:11:56.066
Hit, hit, hit!

01:11:56.484 --> 01:11:58.066
Great job, come on, come on, come on.

01:11:58.068 --> 01:11:59.069
come on, come on, come on!

01:12:53.123 --> 01:12:54.291
You shouldn't have followed me.

01:12:56.126 --> 01:12:57.545
I could've held them off till morning.

01:13:14.144 --> 01:13:15.145
What was that?

01:13:17.565 --> 01:13:18.649
These monsters

01:13:22.277 --> 01:13:25.155
exist at the cost of those who let them in.

01:13:29.159 --> 01:13:31.161
Feeding on their pain.

01:13:34.039 --> 01:13:35.165
But giving something in return.

01:13:37.167 --> 01:13:38.961
To me, they give an illusion

01:13:40.671 --> 01:13:42.172
that my family is still alive.

01:13:46.176 --> 01:13:47.177
Only I lose them

01:13:49.179 --> 01:13:50.180
every time.

01:13:51.181 --> 01:13:52.182
Again and again.

01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:10.200
Back then, in the summer,

01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:14.788
they were here?

01:14:28.218 --> 01:14:29.219
I was going insane.

01:14:32.222 --> 01:14:34.224
Praying for things to go back to normal.

01:14:36.226 --> 01:14:37.227
And I was heard.

01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:41.314
I started having dreams.

01:14:43.233 --> 01:14:44.234
Very real dreams.

01:14:46.236 --> 01:14:48.238
That's how they kept me from forgetting.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.242
Then came the dampness.

01:14:54.244 --> 01:14:55.245
And then they came.

01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:58.248
Standing there, watching,

01:14:59.249 --> 01:15:01.043
as if saying,

01:15:02.252 --> 01:15:03.253
"Let us in.

01:15:05.047 --> 01:15:06.256
And we'll always stay with you."

01:15:08.091 --> 01:15:09.635
At some point, I couldn't resist anymore

01:15:13.263 --> 01:15:14.264
and allowed them in.

01:15:16.809 --> 01:15:19.186
The dreams started lasting for days.

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:22.272
And then I woke up

01:15:23.273 --> 01:15:24.274
and saw their...

01:15:25.275 --> 01:15:26.276
real faces.

01:15:28.278 --> 01:15:30.280
And realized that I invited monsters.

01:15:38.121 --> 01:15:39.748
You never tried to run?

01:15:52.302 --> 01:15:53.303
I didn't want to.

01:16:48.358 --> 01:16:49.359
Damn.

01:16:55.115 --> 01:16:55.949
Katya?

01:17:08.378 --> 01:17:09.377
No,

01:17:09.379 --> 01:17:10.380
No!

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:11.441
Andrey!

01:19:14.713 --> 01:19:15.754
Katya, no!

01:19:15.756 --> 01:19:16.507
Sasha!

01:19:26.517 --> 01:19:27.350
Where's Sasha?

01:20:02.553 --> 01:20:04.555
We need to try to start the fire again!

01:20:06.557 --> 01:20:08.183
They're gonna kill us anyway!

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.353
They won't touch him. It's about us.

01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:13.564
They're gonna just keep killing.

01:20:15.566 --> 01:20:16.567
Am I wrong?

01:20:21.572 --> 01:20:22.656
Vadik, what are you doing?

01:20:26.201 --> 01:20:28.579
He said it, they depend only on him.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.582
He goes, they go with him.

01:20:32.666 --> 01:20:34.585
Give me another idea!

01:20:38.589 --> 01:20:39.590
There is none.

01:20:41.592 --> 01:20:42.591
Lower the gun!

01:20:42.593 --> 01:20:43.594
Katya, he's right.

01:20:45.513 --> 01:20:46.597
I brought them here.

01:20:49.892 --> 01:20:51.143
They will leave with me.

01:20:56.607 --> 01:20:57.608
Katya, no!

01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:00.611
No, Katya!

01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:15.626
Run away!

01:21:17.628 --> 01:21:18.295
No!

01:21:19.630 --> 01:21:21.089
Don't repeat my mistakes.

01:21:23.634 --> 01:21:24.635
Let go.

01:21:32.643 --> 01:21:33.644
Take her out.

01:23:33.346 --> 01:23:34.347
What?

01:23:47.778 --> 01:23:48.779
Embrace me.

01:24:19.548 --> 01:24:24.548
