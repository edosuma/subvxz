00:28.695 --> 00:31.072

00:33.867 --> 00:36.494
<i>And Rosie Revere, engineer</i>

00:36.578 --> 00:39.122
<i>So much to do and you can help too!</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:42.042
<i>A mystery, a riddle, a puzzle or a quest</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:45.128

<i>Connecting all the dots</i>
<i>’Cause this is Scientist Ada Twist!</i>

01:15.825 --> 01:17.786
Morning! Time to get up.

01:17.869 --> 01:20.413
What would I do
without my little alarm clock?

01:20.497 --> 01:21.998
You’d be late.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.416
Ada, you’re right.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.127
I would be late.
I don’t know how you do it.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.046
Good question.

01:28.129 --> 01:31.549
Why do I wake up
at the same time every day?

01:31.633 --> 01:35.637
How can I come up with an experiment
to test how good my internal clock is?

01:35.720 --> 01:36.554
How--

01:36.638 --> 01:39.891
Do I get some coffee
before tackling all these questions?

01:39.974 --> 01:40.975
Yep.

01:46.272 --> 01:49.067
-What’s for breakfast?
-Mum’s making pancakes.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.319
With a little help.

01:51.402 --> 01:54.239
Just pull the string
and that starts a chain reaction

01:54.322 --> 01:56.533
that ends up in delicious yumminess.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.460
Arthur! Breakfast!

02:07.961 --> 02:08.878
Hi, little man.

02:10.130 --> 02:10.964
Rough morning?

02:11.047 --> 02:13.383
Someone woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.802
If a bed has two sides,

02:15.885 --> 02:20.098
shouldn’t there be a 50-50 chance
of waking up on the right side?

02:20.181 --> 02:24.269
So how is it possible
that you always wake up on the wrong side?

02:24.352 --> 02:25.436
Thanks, Dad.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.689
It’s too early for questions.

02:27.772 --> 02:31.442
Mum, I’m going out to my fort
to practice my magic tricks.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.403
It’s a playdate of one.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.280
When Iggy and Rosie come over,

02:35.363 --> 02:38.491
we’ll be experimenting
with ways to make goo gooier.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.619
-Nice. Let me know how it goes.
-Boring!

02:41.703 --> 02:44.372
I’m a scientist.
Scientists never get bored.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.374
Loading the lab.

02:57.635 --> 02:58.928
-Hey, Ada.
-Hiya, Ada.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.680
Hi, Iggy. Hi, Rosie.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.015
How’s the goo coming?

03:02.098 --> 03:04.726
Good. I’ve been doing some experiments.

03:24.913 --> 03:28.208
Turns out a little baking soda
makes it less sticky.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.418
I saw your brother outside. Cool fort.

03:31.461 --> 03:36.674
Lemme guess. Iggy Peck, architect,
you wanna go and see it?

03:36.758 --> 03:38.593
I so do! Yes, please!

03:39.135 --> 03:43.223
I mean, I just like to see
how things are built.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.059
Come on, let’s check it out.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.686
-So cool!
-Amazing!

03:48.770 --> 03:52.440
Look at the broom-handle support.
And pillow foundation?

03:52.523 --> 03:55.068
And the details with the bucket turrets!

03:55.151 --> 03:57.403
This fort is fierce.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.948
-I know.
-Hey, Arthur. Can I come--

04:00.031 --> 04:04.577
Nope. This is a solo fort.
That means it’s a fort for one.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.662
I don’t know.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.122
I’d guesstimate that this fort could fit

04:08.206 --> 04:10.500
two adults and four kids.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.295
Or six kids and one adult.

04:14.379 --> 04:19.592
Or six kids and two adults
if everyone got really friendly.

04:21.219 --> 04:25.056
I’m going to say you could fit
something like 3,000 goldfish.

04:25.139 --> 04:26.432
With or without water?

04:27.892 --> 04:28.726
Without.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.271
Water leaks.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.399
You don’t really know a fort

04:34.482 --> 04:36.651
until you know
how many aliens it can hold.

04:36.734 --> 04:40.863
Depends on what size aliens,
and if they can float.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.742
Solo as in me.

04:44.826 --> 04:49.789
No goldfish. No aliens.
No one asking questions. Just me!

04:50.540 --> 04:52.959
A fort lock? Nice.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.086
You’re just kids, but trust me,

04:55.169 --> 04:56.713
when you get a little older,

04:56.796 --> 04:59.549
sometimes you’ll just need
a little me time.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.303
That’s cool. I just…
I’d love to see how you designed it.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.431
-What if we make you a deal?
-I’m listening.

05:06.514 --> 05:10.977
Okay, if we can open the lock
without touching it,

05:11.060 --> 05:12.395
from behind this line,

05:13.521 --> 05:14.647
you let us in.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.527
No touching? Back here?

05:19.610 --> 05:22.447
I’ll make that deal.
’Cause that’s impossible.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.871
He’s right. It is impossible.

05:29.954 --> 05:33.082
Ada wouldn’t have suggested it
if it was impossible.

05:33.166 --> 05:38.504
Go ahead, Ada. Tell Iggy how we’re going
to open the lock from behind the line.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.798
-I have no idea.
-What?

05:40.882 --> 05:43.051
I have no idea<i> </i>right now.

05:43.134 --> 05:47.930
Scientists look at stuff that seems
impossible and unknowable all the time.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.517
If it’s impossible and unknowable,
why even try?

05:51.601 --> 05:55.188
’Cause it only seems that way.
We just need to break it down.

05:55.271 --> 05:59.108
By asking a lot of small questions,
we can answer our big question.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.527
Break it down and ask around.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.946
Right. Like, how do we get in there?

06:04.447 --> 06:05.782
You know what we need?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.033
A today do-over?

06:07.116 --> 06:08.451
A unicorn?

06:08.534 --> 06:09.744
A brainstorm.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.205
I love a brainstorm.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.957
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

06:15.041 --> 06:17.710
<i>Throw in every thought you had</i>
<i>No idea is ever bad</i>

06:17.794 --> 06:19.962
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

06:20.546 --> 06:23.591
<i>Gather up your friends</i>
<i>Try to find the how, the what, the why</i>

06:23.674 --> 06:26.260
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

06:26.344 --> 06:30.932
<i>Let our imaginations</i>
<i>Become great new creations</i>

06:31.015 --> 06:34.644
<i>When we brainstorm, brainstorm</i>
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

06:34.727 --> 06:35.728
<i>Hey!</i>

06:35.812 --> 06:39.065
-You start.
-What if we melt the lock?

06:40.566 --> 06:43.736
But we might end up
melting the whole fort.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.238
And my brother.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.157
Or we could put the whole fort on rollers

06:48.241 --> 06:52.370
and hook it to a flock of seagulls,
who’d roll it right over to us.

06:52.995 --> 06:58.459
But the fort might be too heavy
for the seagulls, even if it’s on wheels.

06:58.543 --> 07:03.548
Or I could build a lock-picking robot.
But that might take a week or two.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.634
I won’t be out here for a week or two.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.679
I wish we could
just knock that lock right off.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.307
You moved the dirt without touching it.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.936
That’s it! We need a chain reaction.

07:17.019 --> 07:20.898
Right. You only touch the first domino,
but they all fall.

07:20.982 --> 07:24.777
Yep. The energy in the first domino
transfers to the second one,

07:24.861 --> 07:26.904
and then the third and the fourth.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.991
I could design something
to take the energy we used at the start

07:30.074 --> 07:33.119
and transfer it all the way
across the garden to the lock.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.245
-Cool!
-I love it.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.836
Okay. It’s ready.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.214
-That looks amazing.
-Nice.

07:45.756 --> 07:49.677
On paper it does. I just…
I really wish I was a better builder.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.637
That’s what you have me for.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.183
You design it and I’ll build it.
I can build anything.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.435
First, we need a supply run.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.152
Dad, can I borrow…

08:06.235 --> 08:07.904
-Sure, dear.
-Thanks.

08:11.365 --> 08:12.617
Thank you, Mooshu.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.497
-How’s it going out there?
-Good. Yeah, totally good.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.792
I’m just gonna go stretch out
in my solo fort.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.050
Screwdriver.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.303
Hammer.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.180
Wrench.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.350
And… we’re done.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.935
-Wow!
-Amazing!

08:39.018 --> 08:42.438
So, the energy we start with here
ends up over there.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.106
Exactly. It’s physics.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.776
Okay, let’s do this thing.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.238
Three, two, one.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.114
Energy blast off!

09:01.791 --> 09:03.584
What happened?

09:03.668 --> 09:05.169
The energy, it stopped.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.004
-But why?
-I don’t know.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.340
Well, that’s it then. We’re done.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.510
What? No!
We just have to try something new.

09:12.593 --> 09:13.427
Like what?

09:13.511 --> 09:16.097
Maybe the mouse needs to be slipperier.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.560
Let’s try again.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.027
Yay!

09:34.448 --> 09:36.784
-What?
-Did not see that coming.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.328
No, Mooshu! Come back!

09:40.788 --> 09:42.707
That’s it. We failed.

09:42.790 --> 09:46.502
My Great Aunt Rose says,
“The only way to fail is to quit.”

09:46.586 --> 09:48.504
We don’t quit, we’ve got grit!

09:49.380 --> 09:51.632
Okay, you’re right. We don’t quit.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.968
So let’s try something else.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.971
Something less… mouse-y.

09:57.638 --> 10:00.391
The mouse is gone,
so we don’t need the mousetrap.

10:00.474 --> 10:01.726
Yeah, I see it.

10:07.898 --> 10:11.485
-I replaced the whole section.
-You did it!

10:16.782 --> 10:19.493
It’s gonna make it!

10:22.622 --> 10:24.206
-Yeah!
-Yay!

10:24.290 --> 10:27.126
-It worked!
-Yeah, I always knew it would.

10:27.209 --> 10:29.587
That was awesome! Like magic.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.505
Or like science.

10:31.589 --> 10:35.509
Hey, maybe we can create a chain reaction

10:35.593 --> 10:39.055
that will let me unlock the door
from upstairs.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.224
Yeah. We can totally do that.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.811
Cool. That way when you guys come over,
I can let you in.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.438
-Amazing!
-So cool!

10:47.521 --> 10:51.567
Arthur, I brought this super-sticky goo
as a fort-warming present.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.486
Sweet. Make yourself at home.

10:53.569 --> 10:54.487
Thanks, Arthur.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.322
-Got any questions?
-Yeah.

10:56.405 --> 10:59.992
If the fort was filled with owls
and they all flew at once,

11:00.076 --> 11:01.619
would it make the fort fly?

11:01.702 --> 11:02.787
I don’t know.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.331
If this were a space fort,
how much would we weigh?

11:05.414 --> 11:08.209
-A space fort?
-Kids, time for lunch.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.044
Coming!

11:10.628 --> 11:13.381
Also, do you have a unicorn barn
out the back?

11:20.096 --> 11:24.183
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

11:36.737 --> 11:40.700
Hi, my name is Keji Sojobi
and I’m an aerospace engineer,

11:40.783 --> 11:43.119
which means I get to design spacecraft.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.038
Today, I’m gonna talk about
the chain reactions

11:46.122 --> 11:48.874
on the James Webb Space Telescope,
which I got to work on.

11:48.958 --> 11:49.875
<i>Cool!</i>

11:49.959 --> 11:53.087
When it gets out to where it’s going to be
orbiting in space,

11:53.170 --> 11:56.340
the telescope will take pictures
of planets, stars, galaxies,

11:56.424 --> 11:59.927
and those pictures will help us
learn more about our universe.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.805
There are hundreds of chain reactions
that have to happen

12:02.888 --> 12:04.557
for all of it to go smoothly.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.435
A chain reaction is a series of events

12:07.518 --> 12:10.771
that happen because something else
happened before them.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.692
I’m gonna use these models that I made
to show you.

12:14.775 --> 12:18.112
When the James Webb Space Telescope
is on Earth, it’ll be folded up,

12:18.195 --> 12:19.613
looking something like this.

12:19.697 --> 12:23.284
We had to be able
to get from a folded-up position

12:23.367 --> 12:26.287
to a very open position in space.

12:26.370 --> 12:29.957
So after the rocket launches,
the telescope will separate

12:30.040 --> 12:33.085
and start to make its way
to its final destination.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.421
At that point,
the chain reactions will start

12:35.504 --> 12:38.924
that will trigger
the opening of this sunshield.

12:39.759 --> 12:44.764
And on and on and on, little triggers
fully open up the sunshield.

12:44.847 --> 12:48.601
And then the telescope will fully unfold.

12:48.684 --> 12:52.730
Our chain reactions are complete
and the telescope can do its job.

12:52.813 --> 12:53.814
<i>Yay!</i>

12:57.443 --> 13:01.781
Chain reactions can happen really fast,
but they can also last a really long time.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.784
The chain reaction
of James Webb opening up

13:04.867 --> 13:06.619
is gonna be about 30 days.

13:06.702 --> 13:07.661
Fun fact!

13:07.745 --> 13:09.622
There are lots of human-made spacecraft

13:09.705 --> 13:12.666
that you can see from Earth
when you look up at the night sky.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.378
If you see something that looks
like a star, but it’s moving pretty fast,

13:16.462 --> 13:18.172
it’s probably one of our satellites.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.595
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!

13:32.353 --> 13:37.107
Is it me or does it always take longer
to fill a pool on a hot day?

13:37.191 --> 13:41.654
Good question. And does that mean a pool
would fill up faster on a cool day?

13:41.737 --> 13:45.449
Or if it were in the shade?
Or if we filled it with lemonade?

13:46.700 --> 13:48.619
Why do you sound like a bird?

13:48.702 --> 13:51.580
Hey, that wasn’t me.
Birds freak me out a little.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.625
Even when they look happy.
Like these ones do.

13:56.836 --> 14:01.340
That doesn’t sound like happiness to me.
More like the opposite.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.259
Great observation, Rosie.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.719
Looks like these birds
aren’t happy at all.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.346
They seem… angry!

14:10.349 --> 14:14.812
Angry birds? Whoa! Mind blown.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.190
That’s way freakier than happy birds.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.859
Why would birds be angry?

14:19.942 --> 14:24.321
Excellent question. And I know someone
who can help us answer it.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.656
Mum!

14:26.156 --> 14:28.450
No need to shout. I’m right here.

14:28.534 --> 14:32.663
Sorry. Did you know our back garden
is filled with angry birds?

14:33.163 --> 14:35.958
I don’t think I’ve ever seen
this many bickering birdies.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.918
There must be one, two…

14:38.878 --> 14:40.462
twelve angry birds here.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.299
We’re trying to figure out
what’s making them so mad.

14:44.341 --> 14:47.261
Here’s a clue.
Their water feeder is empty.

14:48.554 --> 14:52.182
They must be angry because they don’t have
any water to drink.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.767
So they’re thirsty.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.604
Guess that answers our question
about why they’re angry,

14:56.687 --> 15:01.317
but that doesn’t answer the question about
why there isn’t any water in the feeder.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.110
You always keep it full, Mum.

15:03.193 --> 15:07.573
I do. But yesterday, I had to run
an errand, so I asked your bro…

15:08.198 --> 15:09.033
Arthur!

15:09.116 --> 15:12.244
Yes, Mum? 76, 77, 78, 79…

15:14.330 --> 15:17.791
-What did I do?
-It’s what you didn’t do. The bird feeder?

15:17.875 --> 15:19.835
Weren’t you supposed to fill it
last night?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.462
I did. I promise.

15:23.714 --> 15:29.511
Mooshu Kitty! Someone has a bad habit
of drinking water from the birdie feeder.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.848
That’s probably what happened.
Sorry, boo. My mistake.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.183
Mooshu!

15:34.266 --> 15:37.853
As for you,
you know what I said would happen

15:37.937 --> 15:40.773
if you drank from the feeder
one more time.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.275
That’s the call I’m expecting from work.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.985
What would happen?

15:45.611 --> 15:49.031
Oh no! I think Mum’s
gonna give Mooshu away.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.408
She already warned her
about the bird feeder.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.328
Plus, she wasn’t a cat person
before Dad got her.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.789
Mooshu!

15:56.872 --> 16:00.376
Mum! Mooshu’s innocent. She has to be.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.045
We’ll find a way to prove it
and clear her name.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.131
What? You mean like in a trial?

16:06.215 --> 16:10.803
Yep. Just like in a real courtroom.
You can be the judge, Mrs Twist.

16:10.886 --> 16:15.432
Meet us in the living room,
I mean courtroom, in 30 minutes.

16:15.516 --> 16:19.019
-Okay.
-Don’t do anything to Mooshu till then.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.814
Do anything? What am I gonna do?

16:26.068 --> 16:29.279
We’re going to need
the scientific method for this.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.323
<i>Scientific method</i>

16:31.407 --> 16:35.160
<i>We have an observation</i>
<i>So we’ll start with a question</i>

16:35.661 --> 16:37.621
<i>Do research</i>
<i>Form a hypothesis</i>

16:37.705 --> 16:40.082
<i>And test with experiments</i>

16:40.165 --> 16:42.543
<i>What do we find out?</i>

16:42.626 --> 16:44.420
<i>Let’s draw a conclusion</i>

16:45.295 --> 16:49.633
<i>And write it all down</i>
<i>And pass around the results</i>

16:49.717 --> 16:52.094
<i>That’s the scientific method</i>

16:52.678 --> 16:56.598
Okay, so we have our question.
“What happened to the birds’ water?”

16:56.682 --> 16:58.475
Unicorns drank it.

16:59.059 --> 17:02.646
Maybe a unicorn,
thirsty from chasing rainbows,

17:02.730 --> 17:03.981
drank the water.

17:04.064 --> 17:08.527
But I’m disproving my own theory.
Unicorns like sparkling water.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.988
I think I’ve got it. Ants.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.699
Maybe a gazillion of them
built a tiny aqueduct.

17:13.782 --> 17:18.996
Yes! Now remind me how an aqua duck
is different from a regular duck?

17:19.079 --> 17:24.293
Aqueduct, not duck.
It’s a bridge or canal that moves water.

17:24.376 --> 17:28.297
It’d be the itty-bittiest
architectural feat of all time.

17:29.339 --> 17:34.011
Okay, so our hypothesis is
if Mooshu didn’t drink the birds’ water,

17:34.094 --> 17:35.846
then someone else must have.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.515
I still say ants.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.185
So, like, what do we do now?

17:41.268 --> 17:44.146
We test our hypothesis
by looking for evidence.

17:44.229 --> 17:48.692
That’s what scientists call facts
that prove or disprove their hypothesis.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.288
Loading the lab.

18:08.962 --> 18:13.175
Here’s our first piece of evidence.
A paw print from the scene of the crime.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.761
Exactly the size of Mooshu’s.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.723
Are you sure
there aren’t any ant prints in there?

18:19.807 --> 18:21.683
Nope. Just cat prints.

18:21.767 --> 18:26.063
Okay, so maybe Mooshu was there,
but let’s see what else we’ve got.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.773
Here’s Mooshu’s water bowl.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.318
Empty. Which means
she was probably thirsty.

18:31.401 --> 18:34.404
Which would explain
why she’d want the water.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.367
Boy, this is not looking good for Mooshu.

18:38.450 --> 18:42.204
We still have this fur we found.
Let’s look under the microscope.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.042
It looks just like
the fur from Mooshu’s paw.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.419
Wait a minute.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.256
It is Mooshu’s paw.

18:53.924 --> 18:58.512
Guys, looks like the evidence
is all pointing to one conclusion.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.889
Mooshu’s in cahoots with the ants.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.099
No.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.351
Mooshu drank the birds’ water.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.233
Stay strong, Mooshu.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.777
We’ll send love notes
to wherever Mrs Twist sends you.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.071
But we’re not giving up on you.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.949
80, 81, 82…

19:19.032 --> 19:21.660
-Mum’s ready! 83…
-What are we going to do?

19:21.743 --> 19:25.414
If we don’t prove Mooshu’s innocent,
your mum’s going to give her away.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.748
Come here, Mooshu.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.208
Good girl.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.626
I’ve got it!

19:29.710 --> 19:32.171
If we can’t prove that Mooshu’s innocent,

19:32.254 --> 19:35.799
maybe we can at least prove
that she can behave.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.968
-Yes.
-Great plan.

19:38.051 --> 19:41.889
98, 99, 100. Yes!

19:42.389 --> 19:43.599
All rise!

19:44.975 --> 19:47.686
Honourable Judge Mum now presiding.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.522
Honourable? A mum could get used to this.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.316
We will now hear arguments

19:52.399 --> 19:56.361
in the case of Mooshu
versus the disappearing birdie water.

19:56.987 --> 20:00.407
Your Honour,
we call Mooshu Kitty to the stand.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.451
Your witness is a cat?

20:02.534 --> 20:06.079
This is highly unusual, Ad…
I mean, counsellor.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.498
-We promise it’s important.
-Okay.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.877
Arthur, I mean, bailiff,
let’s put Mooshu on the stand.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.338
And by stand, I mean cat bed.

20:16.673 --> 20:17.716
Mooshu Kitty,

20:17.799 --> 20:21.595
isn’t it true that even though
you’ve never been professionally trained,

20:21.678 --> 20:23.388
you can be very well-behaved?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.854
Back to the stand!

20:30.938 --> 20:34.483
And since you’re
such a well-behaved kitty,

20:35.025 --> 20:38.195
will you promise
to never drink from the bird feeder?

20:38.820 --> 20:40.948
Counsellor, can you control your client?

20:41.031 --> 20:43.659
I’m beginning to doubt
whether she can behave at all.

20:43.742 --> 20:46.411
This is going horribly.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.456
Mooshu is being
the opposite of well-behaved.

20:49.539 --> 20:51.667
No, she’s just…

20:53.043 --> 20:55.963
-Trying to cool off.
-Of course. It’s hot today.

20:56.046 --> 21:00.008
Yes. Hot. Very hot and dry.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.094
Mooshu may not be able to behave,

21:02.177 --> 21:05.389
but maybe we can prove
that something else happened to the water.

21:08.558 --> 21:10.560
Your Honour, may we have a recess?

21:10.644 --> 21:12.896
You want to stop the trial to play?

21:12.980 --> 21:17.526
No. I mean we need a break so we can
go collect one last piece of evidence.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.861
Go ahead, Ada. I mean, counsellor.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.154
Be right back.

21:23.365 --> 21:27.786
-Quick, read me what the thermometer says.
-Temperature, 30 degrees.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.914
And the air is dry.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.708
I think we’ve got our evidence.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.545
Your Honour, we have new evidence.

21:36.628 --> 21:40.340
Yes, it may be true that Mooshu Kitty
was at the scene of the crime,

21:40.424 --> 21:42.968
and, yes, she was thirsty,

21:43.051 --> 21:47.306
and, yes, she might not be
the most well-behaved cat ever,

21:48.181 --> 21:51.393
but maybe Mooshu
didn’t drink the birds’ water,

21:51.476 --> 21:53.895
because it disappeared!

21:54.938 --> 21:59.318
Order! Order in the court.
Could you explain yourself, counsellor?

21:59.401 --> 22:01.570
I propose that the water disappeared

22:01.653 --> 22:05.615
in a scientific process
called “evaporation.”

22:06.366 --> 22:09.328
Evaporation?
Wait, what’s evaporation again?

22:09.411 --> 22:12.039
That’s when water turns into gas.

22:13.373 --> 22:17.711
Then the gas mixes with the air,
making the water seem to disappear.

22:17.794 --> 22:21.006
This process can happen fast
on a hot, dry day

22:21.089 --> 22:23.633
and when there’s only
a teeny bit of water.

22:24.217 --> 22:27.095
Which brings me to our final witness,

22:27.179 --> 22:28.180
Arthur.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.514
Me?

22:31.558 --> 22:34.061
Now, Arthur,
wouldn’t you say you were busy

22:34.144 --> 22:37.397
trying to paddle your ball
100 times in a row yesterday?

22:37.481 --> 22:38.523
Well, sure.

22:38.607 --> 22:42.277
So it must have been really important
to fill the feeder fast.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.530
Fast? Well, I guess, but--

22:45.614 --> 22:47.491
The fastest way to fill the feeder

22:47.574 --> 22:51.787
would be only to put a teeny-weeny
bit of water in it, wouldn’t you say?

22:55.165 --> 22:56.333
Yeah!

22:58.627 --> 23:01.630
I only put a teeny bit of water
in the feeder.

23:01.713 --> 23:06.510
This proves our hypothesis. Something else
could have happened to the birds’ water.

23:06.593 --> 23:10.180
Mooshu Kitty could be innocent.
I rest my case.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.598
-Yay!
-Yes!

23:11.681 --> 23:14.142
Now you won’t
have to give Mooshu away, Mum.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.019
Give Mooshu away? What?

23:16.103 --> 23:18.438
You told Mooshu
that she knew what would happen

23:18.522 --> 23:20.649
if she drank from the bird feeder again.

23:20.732 --> 23:24.861
Yes, I’d give her a second bowl of water.
Outside.

23:25.612 --> 23:26.613
Whoopsies.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.702
You know evaporation
isn't gonna get this water.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.997
I think these birds
are 12 happy birds now.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.624
And one happy kitty.

23:45.215 --> 23:49.386
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.226
Oh boy. It’s really hot out here.

23:56.309 --> 23:59.479
Does anybody know
where I can find some water?

23:59.980 --> 24:03.775
Hi, my name is Naomi Fraga
and I’m a desert botanist,

24:03.859 --> 24:07.404
and today we’re gonna talk
about evaporation in plants.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.948
-Let’s check out some plants.
<i>-Let’s go!</i>

24:10.031 --> 24:14.327
We’re here in the Mojave Desert
where it gets well over 100 degrees

24:14.411 --> 24:16.788
and it also doesn’t rain very much.

24:16.872 --> 24:22.669
These are actually two plants that live
in the same exact kind of environment,

24:22.752 --> 24:26.339
but they have different strategies
to hold on to their water.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.508
<i>-Whoa!</i>
<i>-</i>This is the creosote bush.

24:29.092 --> 24:31.636
See, the leaves here are very small.

24:31.720 --> 24:35.932
That means there’s fewer pores on the leaf
to lose water from.

24:36.016 --> 24:39.478
Just like we have pores in our skin
where we really sweat,

24:39.561 --> 24:43.023
plants have pores on their leaves
where water escapes,

24:43.607 --> 24:47.068
and when that water escapes,
it evaporates into the air.

24:47.652 --> 24:50.530
Then we have its very good friend,
the burrobush.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.490
-Hello!
-Hi!

24:51.573 --> 24:55.076
You might think it was dead,
but it’s taking a nap.

24:55.160 --> 24:59.915
What we call a dormant phase.
It’s lost its leaves for the summertime.

24:59.998 --> 25:03.293
Once it sees rain again,
it’ll make new leaves.

25:03.376 --> 25:07.339
So these plants
have all these really cool adaptations

25:07.422 --> 25:10.091
for dealing with dry conditions.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.801
Fun fact!

25:11.885 --> 25:14.888
Did you know
that when your houseplant is wilting,

25:14.971 --> 25:17.933
it’s because too much water
has evaporated from the leaves?

25:18.016 --> 25:20.101
So if you see your plant wilting,

25:20.185 --> 25:22.562
give it a helping hand
and give it more water.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.855
<i>Yay!</i>

25:27.859 --> 25:31.029
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!
