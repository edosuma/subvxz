00:13.960 --> 00:16.760
<i>After the shocking death of her daughter…</i>

00:16.840 --> 00:19.480
- I will catch you!
- No!

00:19.560 --> 00:21.720
<i>…Brida fled Eoferwic in defeat.</i>

00:21.800 --> 00:22.960
Retreat!

00:25.320 --> 00:29.760
<i>Aethelstan yearns to know</i>
<i>his true father, the King of Wessex,</i>

00:29.840 --> 00:34.320
<i>but Edward's attention turns towards</i>
<i>his new love, the Lady Eadgifu.</i>

00:34.400 --> 00:40.040
For all its strangeness,
I did find our time together enjoyable.

00:40.120 --> 00:43.280
<i>And Aelflaed,</i>
<i>the Queen he no longer loves,</i>

00:43.360 --> 00:46.520
<i>looks to Christ to salve her humiliation.</i>

00:46.600 --> 00:48.760
God knows your heart.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.280
I will pray for you.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.400
<i>My beloved Aethelflaed is dying.</i>

00:53.480 --> 00:57.280
- She will not see the spring.
- You must be mistaken in this, Finan.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.480
She does not have long.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.960
<i>She has chosen Aelfwynn</i>
<i>to succeed her.</i>

01:03.040 --> 01:07.720
Knowing my daughter will be Lady of Mercia
in my stead, it is all I wish.

01:07.800 --> 01:12.240
<i>But as ever in Mercia,</i>
<i>the succession is not straightforward.</i>

01:12.320 --> 01:15.680
The young Lady Aelfwynn
is not fit to rule.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.200
Does your master propose an alternative?

01:18.840 --> 01:21.280
- He does indeed, Lord Burgred.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.680
<i>Now I ride to be with my love.</i>

01:24.320 --> 01:28.160
<i>I pray that I reach her</i>
<i>before it is too late.</i>

01:29.040 --> 01:30.960
<i>Destiny is all!</i>

01:47.800 --> 01:49.280
One!

01:53.760 --> 01:54.800
Two!

01:54.880 --> 01:58.080
- He will not survive.
- This is not about survival.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.600
It is about pain.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.640
Three!

02:00.720 --> 02:03.440
An agony of burning
that the flesh never forgets.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.320
- Then we wait to see if the blood sickens.
- Four!

02:11.400 --> 02:12.720
Five!

02:16.039 --> 02:19.040
- Six!

02:43.640 --> 02:44.960
Seven!

02:47.400 --> 02:48.440
Eight!

02:55.160 --> 02:56.200
Nine!

03:10.960 --> 03:14.080
If the gods have not healed you
by the third sunrise,

03:14.160 --> 03:16.120
they have abandoned you to die.

03:17.040 --> 03:17.920
As will I.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.720
Go, Lord.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.720
Where is she?

04:33.600 --> 04:36.120
I was wondering when you might grace us.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.120
You’re not resting?

04:38.200 --> 04:40.840
She's the Lady of Mercia.
She can do as she chooses.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.680
As she has repeatedly reminded me.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.040
I have told her that she is sick.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.920
As I have told you
that I do not wish to lie still.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.920
There will be time enough for that.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.680
There, I am ready.

05:01.080 --> 05:06.240
- Will you escort me?
- To go where?

05:06.320 --> 05:08.960
I have some obligations I must attend to.

05:11.640 --> 05:12.600
Let us go.

05:20.160 --> 05:23.000
You knew she was sick
and you did not tell me?

05:23.080 --> 05:26.240
She asked for my help and my silence.
I gave her both.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.400
She is dying, Uhtred.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.120
I have seen this before in those
whose time is close.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.040
They feel suddenly alive before…

05:41.840 --> 05:44.960
But do not be fooled,
she has little time left.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.200
Your nailed god cheated death, yes?

06:15.560 --> 06:18.600
After three days
suffering all the torments of hell.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.600
You believe that He will raise you
from the dead on the day of judgement?

06:23.720 --> 06:26.080
It is a tenet of our faith, yes.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.520
He was your god as well, Brida.

06:30.600 --> 06:35.040
Do not forget where your life began
with Him, not the Danes.

06:35.120 --> 06:40.400
- You are His child, just like we all are--
- Tell me then, why did He abandon me?

06:41.560 --> 06:42.720
Why?

06:43.920 --> 06:48.880
If Vibeke was His child,
why did He let her die? Why?

06:52.240 --> 06:56.920
Will He protect you, Father, hm?
Will He save you in this moment? Tell me.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.440
If He has decided
that this is my time, then so be it.

07:02.040 --> 07:06.600
Do not be so eager to believe that He has
any control over how your life ends.

07:06.680 --> 07:10.760
This will not be quick.
This is just beginning.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.600
Help him! Help!

07:14.680 --> 07:19.240
Where is He, Father? Is He coming?
Is He on his way?

07:19.320 --> 07:22.880
Help him!

07:29.360 --> 07:32.240
It is strange
to see it so empty.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.600
It is not empty.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.560
Not yet.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.880
No. Not yet.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.920
You will not have to do this alone.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.920
- I will remain with you.
- And I am so grateful for that.

07:51.760 --> 07:56.600
I only hope that I might find her strength
when the time comes.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.000
I have served your mother for many years.

08:02.080 --> 08:05.320
You are her daughter.
I can see much of her in you.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.280
<i> I always thought</i>
<i>that rule would mean conflict,</i>

08:11.360 --> 08:14.080
but the truth is
the people simply want peace.

08:15.320 --> 08:20.480
If they are well fed, if they have homes,
if they are warm,

08:20.560 --> 08:22.920
then they will soon come to respect you.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.240
Where are we going?

08:28.320 --> 08:31.880
I have some business with one
of the Ealdormen that I must attend to.

08:31.960 --> 08:35.760
- Surely this is not the time?
- Oh, so do tell me, what time is it?

08:35.840 --> 08:37.960
It is time to fight
what is happening to you.

08:38.039 --> 08:41.640
Do not be naive, Uhtred.
The battle is done.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.559
- Why are you giving up so easily?
- I am not giving up!

08:47.159 --> 08:50.960
I did not choose this.
This is the path that God has given to me.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.120
- My Lady.
- Ealdorman Burgred.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.960
I have completed the letter
that we spoke of.

09:14.960 --> 09:19.440
- This… this is too much.
- It is barely enough.

09:20.120 --> 09:24.440
Mercia needs to be protected and I am sure
you will do what needs to be done.

09:28.320 --> 09:32.440
My Lady, you have been good to us.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.320
Just and fair.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.800
I remember when he was terrified
at the thought of you on the throne.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.800
People change, given time.

09:53.640 --> 09:54.960
What did you give him?

09:55.960 --> 09:59.560
I have land in my name that I wanted
to give to the people to ensure

09:59.640 --> 10:01.880
that it remains theirs when I am gone.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.240
- And who will take the throne?
- Aelfwynn.

10:07.600 --> 10:11.400
She is not the girl you once knew.
She understands her duty.

10:13.320 --> 10:16.720
If Edward and I can maintain our alliance
through our successors

10:16.800 --> 10:20.720
and they in theirs, our peace and unity
could last for generations.

10:21.560 --> 10:26.560
Aldhelm will remain with her to guide her
and she will have an army for protection.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.160
I do not wish to ask more favors of you.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.560
- Aethelflaed.
- Please.

10:34.840 --> 10:35.840
Let me speak.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.240
I would feel happier to leave her
if I knew

10:40.320 --> 10:42.280
that you would ensure her safety.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.360
- You do not even have to ask.
- I do.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.760
Your life is not here with me.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.960
Aelfwynn is not your kin.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.680
- I did not help you when you came to me--
- Stop.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.080
I will protect Aelfwynn and Mercia
as best I can.

11:03.960 --> 11:09.160
Come. Let us find somewhere quiet to sit
or some may think I am breaking my oath.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.640
The gate is this way.

11:13.160 --> 11:17.120
There are other gates, ones that are not
so fiercely guarded.

11:31.880 --> 11:35.800
So, all these years I could have been
sneaking in here to hump you?

11:47.720 --> 11:50.800
I should send word
to my husband that it is finished.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.520
That he might ride to Lindisfarne
and see it.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.320
I am sure that both the Lord our God
and the King

11:57.400 --> 11:59.560
will be impressed with your tribute.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.560
You awake early, do you not?

12:05.240 --> 12:09.600
I pray every day to our Lord God
in the light of a new dawning sun.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.600
The King departed this morning.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.440
Did you happen to witness it?

12:18.400 --> 12:19.960
Did anybody accompany him?

12:22.440 --> 12:26.040
I think perhaps
the Lady Eadgifu rode with him.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.360
Come with us to Lindisfarne.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.800
The King has warned me
that my presence there

12:38.880 --> 12:41.520
could be seen as a claim
to the land itself

12:41.600 --> 12:44.040
and my father would surely take his side.

12:45.160 --> 12:48.160
No, I should remain here.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.600
Travel with us and do not tell them.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.160
It is not provocation.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.000
It is a holy tribute.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.200
Nothing is more pure.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.200
I should like to witness
its glory myself.

13:05.920 --> 13:09.960
As I am certain,
the King would also witness yours.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.800
Do you wish a chance to pray?

13:29.400 --> 13:31.480
What prayer would you have me make?

13:31.560 --> 13:36.080
I don’t know. What prayer would be best
to beg your god for your life?

13:36.160 --> 13:39.320
My life is in your hands, not His.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.280
Think that there is somewhere after this?

13:43.360 --> 13:47.600
I think that we will join Him
in life everlasting.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.480
Your god came back to life
while my daughter is cold.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.960
She will live with Him in eternal life.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.440
Tell Him to give her back.

14:06.120 --> 14:11.000
Give her back?
That is not something that my god does.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.520
A life for a life, then.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.080
Orvar! Orvar, will you give yourself
to me for Vibeke?

14:16.160 --> 14:18.560
No, there is no trading lives!

14:19.800 --> 14:23.480
Consider it a threat. Return her to me,
or this one's death will be on your hands.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.480
- I cannot do that.
- But your god can.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.040
You’re His voice! So speak! Give her back!

14:28.120 --> 14:30.600
- Give her back!
- Dear God, spare her!

14:30.680 --> 14:32.920
Put no more blood on her hands!

14:34.560 --> 14:37.560
She was born your servant.
She need not die in torment.

14:37.640 --> 14:42.120
She can still repent
and join her daughter in paradise.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.720
My daughter’s dead.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.600
My daughter’s dead. I’m lost.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.200
We’re never truly lost.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.720
God will find you.
You were born a Christian.

15:27.800 --> 15:31.400
He has seen the good that was passed on
through you to your daughter's heart.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.760
Your god did not save Vibeke,
He let her die.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.880
There is no life after this for her.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.160
She’s alone.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.280
She’s alone.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.320
I am alone!

16:01.080 --> 16:02.280
No, you are not.

16:17.120 --> 16:21.000
- Perhaps we should rest here.
- For a short while.

16:28.040 --> 16:31.920
Is it cold? I feel so cold.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.600
It is cold enough.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.680
You should have told me.

16:57.800 --> 17:01.160
I did not owe you a share of my pain.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.160
I have not stopped wondering…

17:12.079 --> 17:14.079
about what we gave up…

17:15.720 --> 17:17.160
to become who we are.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.480
Do you regret it?

17:22.280 --> 17:23.359
On occasion.

17:25.920 --> 17:30.760
Then when I do,
it is with every part of my being.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.440
What of you?

17:40.960 --> 17:45.800
Would you have begged fate
for a different path over these years?

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Mercia's people are contented.
They’re safe.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.000
How could I deny them all you have done?

18:17.360 --> 18:19.360
That does not answer my question.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.200
I have dreamed of us.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.400
As a family.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.760
And a happy one.

18:41.160 --> 18:44.600
But even through that happiness,
even in my dreams…

18:49.800 --> 18:53.240
we never cease worrying
that we have made the wrong choice.

18:54.880 --> 18:58.040
That's the curse of life,
to think of what might have been.

18:59.200 --> 19:04.760
Your path was to bring peace to Mercia,
to protect it.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.640
Who will protect you,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg?

19:11.880 --> 19:14.040
I do not need protection.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.040
You do.

19:16.760 --> 19:17.600
You do.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.200
You are carrying so much pain.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.160
I would have told you…

19:59.560 --> 20:02.720
My daughter committed
the greatest of all your god's sins.

20:04.560 --> 20:08.960
If He does exist,
she will have been sent to the flames.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.560
That part of the Holy Book
has never much felt true to me.

20:14.640 --> 20:18.320
It seems to me there’s not much separating
Heaven and Valhalla.

20:19.080 --> 20:23.400
That if we are right in our beliefs,
there is something better after this.

20:26.760 --> 20:30.960
- No, your daughter had no chance to sin.
- She made others kill for her.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.680
That’s the same as if the knife
was in her hand.

20:35.760 --> 20:40.520
And as our parents teach us,
she was trying to please you. That is all.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.920
It is not her sin to repent for.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.680
It’s not too late to believe in Him,
Brida.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.240
It is never too late.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.560
Believing in your god made the Danes weak.

20:56.640 --> 21:00.480
They lost their souls.
My daughter lost her life.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.400
I blame you.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.240
I blame your church,
your kings and your queens.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.880
And most of all, I blame
every so-called Dane who bowed to them

21:13.960 --> 21:16.760
and sucked at their teats
and who took their baptism rites.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.000
You should eat.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.200
I cannot help to end your pain.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.040
Nothing can.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.160
But your daughter is at peace now.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.960
Maybe in finding peace of your own,
you might repent.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.360
I don’t want your bread.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.840
I believe it was your bread to begin with.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.080
Should you change your mind.

22:19.720 --> 22:23.600


22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
There is no honor
in him freezing to death.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.800
There is no honor in what he did to us

22:33.880 --> 22:36.400
- and yet you would forgive him.
- The gods have forgiven him.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.760
He passed their trial.
He must be in their favor.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.480
If his flesh begins to heal,

22:40.560 --> 22:43.280
then we can talk about
allowing him back into the city.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.480
- Listen to me! He is my brother!
- And I am your wife!

22:50.120 --> 22:52.920
His fate is set.
It’s in the hands of the gods now.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.920
He will die or he will survive.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.920
We will not know
until his hands are unbound.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.520
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.360
What was that?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
King's men.

23:24.280 --> 23:26.320
When was the last time
you saw your father?

23:31.680 --> 23:33.080
A long time ago.

23:33.160 --> 23:36.480
Well, you'll be a fair bit taller
than him now, I'll bet.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.760
- Uncle?
- Aelfwynn.

23:58.360 --> 24:01.080
- Am I too late? Where is she?
- She… She’s not here.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.600
- Where is she?
- She is with Uhtred.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.200
- Of course.
- She wanted to see him before…

24:11.680 --> 24:14.960
I do not understand
why she is being taken from us now.

24:15.040 --> 24:18.240
Time robs us, over and over again.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.480
Your mother is the best of us.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.280
If I could keep her here,
you know I would.

24:27.360 --> 24:28.200
I know.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.480
The… the Ealdormen have been told
to prepare.

24:32.560 --> 24:36.000
I’m concerned that they will not honor
Mother's wishes.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.840
The Ealdormen will be taken care of.
Do not fear.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.800
Your mother and I had
a shared wish…

24:44.720 --> 24:47.240
to honor our father's desire for unity.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.640
I swear to you and to her…

24:53.960 --> 24:56.800
I will do all I can to ensure
that comes to pass.

25:03.280 --> 25:06.960
Please, let my Lord King
listen to the words of this servant.

25:09.440 --> 25:12.680
Please, let my Lord listen to the words
of this servant.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.920
I did not get to speak with you…

26:57.200 --> 26:58.120
I love you.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.360
I will protect all that we have
achieved, sister.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.640
This I swear to you.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.960
Receive your servant Vibeke

27:24.720 --> 27:28.200
into the ranks of your devout saints
and most bright angels.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.440
She is a child of God.

27:39.560 --> 27:42.960
Please let my Lord listen
to the words of this servant…

27:47.520 --> 27:48.680
Lady Aelswith…

27:48.760 --> 27:52.240
You do not need to say
anything, Lord Uhtred.

27:56.440 --> 27:57.840
I would ask you…

27:59.600 --> 28:01.520
Do you hear anything?

28:03.760 --> 28:04.720
Erm…

28:06.080 --> 28:08.080
It is night. The town is asleep.

28:08.160 --> 28:09.360
Not out there.

28:10.240 --> 28:13.400
In here. In this room.

28:13.480 --> 28:14.880
Do you hear anything?

28:16.360 --> 28:18.360
No, nothing but our own voices.

28:19.880 --> 28:24.160
Mere mortals.
I do not care for our voices.

28:28.120 --> 28:31.840
He is not speaking.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.240
I thought that He would speak to me now.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.240
Is it not clear that I need Him?

28:42.080 --> 28:44.960
All I have ever asked of Him…

28:45.920 --> 28:49.080
is His voice when I needed it.

28:53.040 --> 28:57.520
Perhaps His silence
is Him offering you solace in--

28:57.600 --> 28:59.960
I do not need His solace.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.240
I need Him to speak to me.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.320
My life, I have given to Him.

29:10.320 --> 29:16.400
I have prayed for so many hours,
Lord Uhtred.

29:18.640 --> 29:22.640
I have begged Him to save her.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.040
I need to know that He is listening.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.960
I fear your prayers have been wasted.

29:46.040 --> 29:49.280
Please, let my Lord the King
listen to the words of His servant.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.400
Please, let my Lord
listen to the words of…

29:51.480 --> 29:55.600
- Lady Aelswith…
- I am trying to make Him hear me!

30:06.320 --> 30:07.840
Do not say it.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.920
Do not say the words.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.320
He has forsaken me.

30:22.760 --> 30:25.000
He has forsaken her.

30:27.320 --> 30:31.200
I have given Him the entirety of my life.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.960
And I am left with nothing.

31:06.440 --> 31:07.760
Where is Aelfwynn?

31:13.320 --> 31:15.080
She is waiting for the Witan.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.560
They will take advantage of her.

31:19.640 --> 31:24.200
They respected Aethelflaed. Surely
they will accept her choice of successor.

31:24.280 --> 31:28.720
Aelfwynn is too young
and she is not worldly.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.680
They will turn on her.

31:34.320 --> 31:37.960
She can gain their respect
just as Aethelflaed did.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.240
As wise as she had become…

31:43.120 --> 31:46.640
Aethelflaed still wished to believe
the best in people.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.920
But she was wrong.

31:51.920 --> 31:56.640
There has already been so much death,
Uhtred.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.760
I could not bear more of it.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.640
I’ve had too much… oh…

32:08.720 --> 32:11.240
- Leave me here.
- You’re all right.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.680
- Oh, God.
- Come on. Up the stairs.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.480
- Are the men ready?
- They’re waiting for your signal.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.360
And is there word
from Father Pyrlig?

32:31.440 --> 32:33.800
A scout reported seeing him
with the Danish witch.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.520
Then he is likely dead.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.040
Return to your position.
It will not be long.

32:52.640 --> 32:53.880
Aethelstan?

32:55.760 --> 32:56.760
What are you…?

32:58.080 --> 32:59.320
You came with Uhtred.

33:00.600 --> 33:04.120
He wanted the chance to say goodbye
to Lady Aethelflaed.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.880
A chance that his presence here denied me.

33:05.960 --> 33:10.120
Well, it seems he’s taken many things
from you over time.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.680
I have often wondered of you.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.760
Surely I would not have been hard to find.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.760
We have found each other now, it seems.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.920
There are matters to be attended to. We…

33:28.360 --> 33:30.560
I should like to talk further with you.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.800
Much has changed in both of
our lives, but now is not the time.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.320
It is good to see you, Aethelstan.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
You were much favored by my mother.
She would have been glad to have you here.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.000
You look like her.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.560
Have the Ealdormen been told?

34:04.400 --> 34:07.160
We will ring the bells when it is time
for the Witan to meet.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.600
They’ll be terrified to leave Mercia
without a ruler

34:09.680 --> 34:11.320
for even a moment's breath.

34:11.400 --> 34:15.280
The Ealdormen respected your mother.
They will similarly respect her wishes.

34:16.440 --> 34:18.360
And Lord Aethelhelm has arrived.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.520
As much as his intentions
will be self-serving,

34:21.600 --> 34:23.480
his presence might help to delay matters.

34:23.560 --> 34:27.480
My mother has been dead a matter of hours
and already he seeks to undermine her.

34:28.360 --> 34:32.600
No, she would not have delayed it
and neither will I.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.639
You are in mourning.
You would be forgiven--

34:34.719 --> 34:36.560
My mother would not forgive me.

34:38.960 --> 34:43.440
I will not deny this land or its people
what she wanted for them.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.199
I should have been here sooner.

34:50.239 --> 34:53.679
What matters is that you were
here for her when she needed you to be.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.480
Will you be remaining here?

34:59.159 --> 35:03.360
- Until Aelfwynn takes the throne.
- Should her grandmother allow it.

35:05.440 --> 35:08.280
Lady Aelswith is afraid
it is the wrong decision.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.680
Bitter old women rarely want more
for their descendants.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.880
She might be right.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.800
Why do we attach ourselves
to these people, Uhtred?

35:23.760 --> 35:26.120
I do not think it is our choice.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.760
Because it is our destiny?

35:31.120 --> 35:32.520
Then destiny is cruel.

35:33.480 --> 35:36.960
All it seems to do is cause us
sorrow and pain.

35:39.960 --> 35:42.120
If that is the path it sees for us.

35:43.080 --> 35:46.800
I wonder if destiny lost its hold on me
when I left these lands.

35:48.960 --> 35:52.400
I have been free of pain for a while now
and better for it.

35:53.800 --> 35:57.600
Perhaps pain is our choice, not destiny’s.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.200
So tell me, Uhtred.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.720
What would finally allow you
to be free of your pain?

36:23.320 --> 36:26.480
- What are they speaking of?
- I do not know.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.960
But I’m sure no good
can come of it.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.640
We should head back to the palace.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.040
You served her well.

36:59.560 --> 37:03.600
I tried. All she wanted
was to keep the people safe.

37:05.480 --> 37:09.520
She could think of no way
to make it more simple to rule?

37:10.280 --> 37:11.480
She tried.

37:12.040 --> 37:15.520
But the Ealdormen, even as they came
to respect her, were stubborn.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.960
The old ways appealed to them
more than the new.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.600
I think you could yet be of great use
to Mercia, Lord Aldhelm.

37:25.320 --> 37:26.880
You do not have to be here this early.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.760
- We’ve not yet begun.
- Yes, I do.

37:34.640 --> 37:36.000
Stay yourself!

37:37.240 --> 37:40.400
The throne is taken after the Witan meets,
not before.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.840
I did not expect to see you here.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.960
- I am here to show respect.
- Oh, I doubt that.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.480
A man who has no respect
cannot show it, surely. Lord King.

37:52.560 --> 37:54.000
This is taking too long.

37:54.080 --> 37:57.360
- We must announce her death.
- I would think it were the King's decision

37:57.440 --> 37:59.640
as to when the bells should be rung,
my Lord.

37:59.720 --> 38:02.880
- I was merely suggesting--
- That you understood the King's grief

38:02.960 --> 38:06.000
- better than he himself?
- Who are you to speak to me this way?

38:06.080 --> 38:07.560
You would watch your tongue!

38:09.000 --> 38:10.960
The bells will ring in good time.

38:13.920 --> 38:17.200
It is nearly dawn. Let us see the day
in with the saddest news.

38:36.200 --> 38:39.080
Shut that door!
My balls are freezing to nothing!

38:43.280 --> 38:45.640
- Something’s wrong.
- Just go back to bed.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.360
Get some sleep. Lord Uhtred
might need us in the morning.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.480
There, did you see that?
Wake up.

38:51.560 --> 38:56.400
No, no, it's the ale.
Your eyes are playing tricks on you. Just…

39:05.840 --> 39:09.160
- Think about where you're pointing that.
- There are soldiers here.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.680
You think it's an attack?

39:13.600 --> 39:16.320
The King is here and undefended.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.920
Piss.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.880
Go and find Uhtred. I’ll get the others.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.560
Do not do anything stupid.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.560
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.120
It is time.

39:43.680 --> 39:46.800
Ring the bell.
Let my sister's death be known.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.520
You seem troubled.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.160
I don’t like black. It’s so cold.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.080
It would be a strange man who does.

40:01.880 --> 40:02.880
It is time.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.760
She asked that you protect Mercia.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.480
You have only done
as you saw right and good.

40:18.880 --> 40:19.840
Perhaps.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.240
Aethelstan!

40:51.320 --> 40:52.400
Shit!

41:15.120 --> 41:16.720
- Uhtred!

41:21.080 --> 41:22.080
Uhtred!

41:25.520 --> 41:26.360
Uhtred!

42:18.760 --> 42:20.600
Leave him.

42:22.360 --> 42:24.120
What happened? Are you all right?

42:24.920 --> 42:27.440
Lord, I think you need to see this.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.560
- Who are they?
- The Ealdormen.

42:39.800 --> 42:40.640
Come!

42:41.560 --> 42:44.560
- Who gave your orders?
- Come on. Tell us!

42:46.240 --> 42:47.360
Uhtred, I know him.

42:47.440 --> 42:49.640
I saw him talking
with the King last night.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.280
Did you see them?

43:04.000 --> 43:06.280
- Did you see the Ealdormen?
- I did.

43:06.360 --> 43:09.120
- So, where are they?
- They are dead.

43:10.120 --> 43:13.000
Dead? That cannot be.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.760
You… What did you do?

43:19.840 --> 43:22.320
You overstep your bounds, Lord Aethelhelm!

43:23.200 --> 43:26.600
The only explanation I need offer
is the example of our past.

43:26.680 --> 43:29.000
The strength of Wessex and Mercia
both only improved

43:29.080 --> 43:30.680
under the alliance with my sister.

43:31.760 --> 43:34.080
I could not see that strength fade now.

43:34.160 --> 43:36.680
Lady Aethelflaed's choice of successor
is her daughter.

43:36.760 --> 43:39.640
- She has her mother's strength.
- I have not seen it.

43:40.840 --> 43:43.040
My sister's strength came
with time.

43:43.680 --> 43:45.640
To leave my niece
to find her own strength

43:45.720 --> 43:48.800
would leave Mercia vulnerable.
She will not take the throne.

43:48.880 --> 43:53.080
Then there are others who could rule
whilst staying within the family's line.

43:53.160 --> 43:54.480
Father's hopes were of unity.

43:54.560 --> 43:59.040
It was a dream my sister and I bore
from him and shared, but now she is dead.

44:00.760 --> 44:03.160
Had she known it were possible
to unite the kingdoms--

44:03.240 --> 44:05.920
She would not have done it with the blood
of innocents on her hands!

44:06.000 --> 44:09.960
Her hands are unsullied. The choice
was mine alone and I was forced to act.

44:10.040 --> 44:11.960
The Ealdormen had already accepted bribes

44:12.040 --> 44:14.600
to sway their minds away
from my sister's wishes.

44:15.440 --> 44:18.240
These men were standing
in the way of progress.

44:18.320 --> 44:24.040
- I merely acted to remove the corruption.
- This is not how succession is determined!

44:24.120 --> 44:28.240
Until my sister's rule, succession
was always determined by bloodshed.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.280
I did not want it to be so again.

44:35.120 --> 44:37.840
Better the blood of the few,
than the blood of the many.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.680
You have murdered
Mercia’s Ealdormen.

44:43.520 --> 44:46.560
And in doing so,
I have ensured Mercia's protection.

44:59.160 --> 45:00.680
I will do as God wills.

45:02.160 --> 45:05.720
I will be King of the Angles
and of the Saxons.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.760
You are still alive, then?

45:57.360 --> 45:58.680
That’s because of you.

46:05.960 --> 46:07.200
Will you look?

46:25.160 --> 46:26.840
The flesh has begun to heal.

46:33.080 --> 46:34.680
The gods have forgiven you.

46:38.600 --> 46:39.840
What of you, brother?

46:41.800 --> 46:43.120
Have you forgiven me?

46:44.360 --> 46:47.800
If it were Stiorra's choice,
you would be left to fend for yourself.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.600
Then I am lucky that it is not.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.200
She is not a true Dane.

46:55.280 --> 46:59.280
A true Dane would not betray
their family as you did.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.400
You are my blood.

47:11.360 --> 47:13.520
Do you understand? You are my blood.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.160
The rest will come in time.

47:53.760 --> 47:57.000
- Have you seen Lady Aelswith?
- Yes, she came through here with Aelfwynn.

47:57.080 --> 47:59.600
- They left for--
- Don’t say it out loud.

47:59.680 --> 48:02.520
You should leave this place.
It is not safe here.

48:09.200 --> 48:13.840
Ah, it’s just a scratch. It’ll heal.
You might get a good scar out of it.

48:14.560 --> 48:16.520
It did not bleed like a scratch.

48:18.680 --> 48:20.440
All right lads, at the ready.

48:21.600 --> 48:24.760
My men are merely seeking their horses.
There's to be no trouble here.

48:27.720 --> 48:29.200
You killed the Ealdormen.

48:30.800 --> 48:33.480
- It is only what needed to be done.
- They were old men.

48:34.760 --> 48:35.880
Defenseless.

48:38.400 --> 48:41.160
Uhtred has taught you
his strong sense of morality, then.

48:44.520 --> 48:47.920
Surely he has also taught
it is better to strike first

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
if it might prevent more violence.

48:51.040 --> 48:54.880
Yet it was not my intention
for you to be caught in this.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.320
My man tells me you fought well.

49:00.320 --> 49:03.800
Not well enough,
or he would not be here to tell you of it.

49:04.800 --> 49:08.360
- Your blood is strong.
- My skill comes only from my training.

49:11.880 --> 49:14.080
I must ready myself for the ceremony.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.480
Will you attend?

49:18.880 --> 49:20.200
I will be with Uhtred.

49:23.040 --> 49:25.440
Well, you’d be welcome
should you change your mind.

49:29.120 --> 49:33.480
Aethelflaed was your blood… as am I.

50:09.880 --> 50:10.880
It’s done.

50:16.320 --> 50:17.440
She gave me peace.

50:21.840 --> 50:23.720
When I was with her, I felt it.

50:27.920 --> 50:30.480
I’m sure she would want you
to find that feeling again.

50:31.640 --> 50:33.360
I can think of no better tribute.

51:31.800 --> 51:33.920
It looks to be
a worthy procession.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.040
It is.

51:39.880 --> 51:45.040
- Are you going to retaliate?
- He did what kings always do.

51:45.120 --> 51:49.080
No king has ever ruled bloodlessly.
It is not in their nature.

51:49.160 --> 51:51.560
It is no way to become a king, Uhtred.

51:51.640 --> 51:53.920
I think it might be the only way.

51:57.040 --> 51:57.960
It is over now.

51:59.280 --> 52:01.840
Edward's rule will not be challenged.

52:01.920 --> 52:05.480
His line will watch the throne
until it becomes their turn…

52:07.920 --> 52:09.600
just as King Alfred wanted.
