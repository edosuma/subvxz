11:30.856 --> 11:32.425

11:32.491 --> 11:34.827
You know the bastards
who murdered my sheep

11:34.894 --> 11:38.464
because you know who has the
lease to where their bodies lay.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.400
- So, you admit you were
on someone else's lease.

11:41.467 --> 11:44.770
- Sheep, they wander.

11:44.837 --> 11:47.306
They don't know where one
lease ends and another begins.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.308
Jake: Then why have
leases at all?

11:49.375 --> 11:50.743
Sheep eat to the root.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.279
They ruin the grass for cattle
or anything else to eat.

One could argue you
killed his livestock too,

11:56.182 --> 11:57.783

longer to die.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.655
Until it rains, there will be
no grazing in the valley.

12:02.721 --> 12:06.125
What grass there is in
the mountains is all we have.

12:06.192 --> 12:09.495
If you got too many sheep
for your allotment, sell some.

- Sell some?

12:12.798 --> 12:14.600
Sell them to who?

12:14.667 --> 12:17.103
The war's over.
There's nobody to buy them.

12:17.169 --> 12:18.771
- We're all in the same boat.

12:18.838 --> 12:22.041
I suggest we work together
or that boat is headed back

12:22.108 --> 12:23.542

blade of grass

12:28.481 --> 12:32.051

You have the land, you have
the lease, you have everything.

12:36.021 --> 12:38.591

fought for.

12:38.657 --> 12:40.759
You want to fight me
for it, too?

12:42.361 --> 12:45.097
I didn't think so.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.533

you should have leased more.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.978

13:33.045 --> 13:35.614
I'm a member just

13:35.681 --> 13:38.617

13:38.684 --> 13:40.986
You grazed down all your
grass then pushed your flock

13:41.053 --> 13:42.721
on another man's grass.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.590
- The locust ate my grass.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.659
- The locust
ate everyone's grass.

13:46.725 --> 13:48.861
We're all suffering.
Take your flock higher.

13:48.928 --> 13:51.564
- Then it's bears killing
'em instead of cowboys.

13:51.630 --> 13:54.400
- What can I say, Banner?

13:54.466 --> 13:56.035
That's ranching for you.

14:07.046 --> 14:09.481

about the other eleven.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.816
Just you.

14:10.883 --> 14:13.219
- Hey! God damn it.

14:13.285 --> 14:15.354
I will not
have this in my town!

14:15.421 --> 14:17.223
That man is an agent
of the state.

14:17.289 --> 14:20.292
Threaten him again and you
sleep on concrete for a month.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.727
Understand?

14:21.794 --> 14:25.264
- Stealing a man's grass
is like stealing his steers.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.199
You graze another
man's lease again

14:27.266 --> 14:30.436
and I'll have your whole flock.
And I am a man of my word.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.609
- Stealing grass.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.978
Man doesn't own the grass.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.313
The mountains own the grass.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.649
God owns the grass.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.619
And you're no god, Jacob Dutton.

14:46.685 --> 14:48.153
You're no god!

14:49.622 --> 14:52.057

14:55.027 --> 14:56.395

what would happen

14:56.462 --> 14:57.630
if cattle grazed his land.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.598
- He'd shoot 'em
where he find 'em.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.500
And bill the rancher
for the bullet.

15:10.342 --> 15:11.910
[chatter]

its horses into the Crazies.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.685
Ain't a blade of grass
from here to Miles City.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.520
- Can't sell 'em
with these prices.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.622
- I don't see how
a war ending

15:23.689 --> 15:25.691
can cause such hell
on the market.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.160
Hell, all those soldiers
came home.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.329
They don't eat here,
only overseas?

15:30.396 --> 15:33.265
- They're eating their own beef.
They don't need to buy ours.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.767
- Why don't we graze
the homesteader land?

15:34.833 --> 15:36.335
Hell, bank owns all of that now.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.636
I doubt they'd care.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.305
- I doubt they'd even know.

15:39.371 --> 15:40.873
- The bank always knows.

15:40.939 --> 15:44.543
I've got the ground. It's high.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.446
Bears and wolves
will be plaguing us.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.682
We'll have to sit with 'em
all summer.

15:49.748 --> 15:53.719
I say let's push the herds
together, take 'em up there,

15:53.786 --> 15:55.487
sit with them
till the fall.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.156
- You know how many cowboys
it's gonna take

15:57.222 --> 15:59.558
to babysit a herd
that size all summer?

15:59.625 --> 16:00.693
- I am aware.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.294
- I'm short of cowboys as it is.

16:02.361 --> 16:04.763
- You're gonna be short cattle
if you don't get 'em to grass.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.365
- How we gonna feed
'em in the winter?

16:06.432 --> 16:09.768
- Let's get 'em through
the summer, first.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.170
I won't charge a lease,

16:11.236 --> 16:14.640
but y'all band together
and, uh, contract some hay.

16:14.707 --> 16:19.511
I hear Oregon is free
of the locust...for now.

16:19.578 --> 16:22.581
- I don't know, Jake.
Half of mine are too weak
to make the trip.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.816
- We'll push 'em slow.

16:23.882 --> 16:26.218
Graze them along the river.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.687
Push 'em up by the park.

16:28.754 --> 16:31.190
- Yeah. Well, if it weren't
for the easy years

16:31.256 --> 16:33.525
I wouldn't waste my time
with the tough ones.

- I been here since 1894, Clive.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.366
I do not remember an easy year.

16:40.432 --> 16:41.867
Do you?

16:41.934 --> 16:44.103
- No.
- [laughs]

16:48.640 --> 16:51.176
- Yeah, all right!
Whoa!

16:51.243 --> 16:52.811
[men shouting]

16:56.548 --> 16:57.950
- Stay with him!
- Woo!

17:00.853 --> 17:01.887
- Woo!

17:06.925 --> 17:08.160
Man: Woo!

17:08.227 --> 17:10.295
- Come on, this ain't no
rodeo, collect him up.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.064
Keep him moving left.

17:12.131 --> 17:14.933
- Don't get him killed
a week before his wedding.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.135
- I told him not
to pick this one.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.170
- That's probably
why he picked it.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.371
[men shouting]

17:24.209 --> 17:25.644
It's late.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.746
- This won't be our first ride
in the dark, ma'am.

17:27.813 --> 17:28.814
- Yes, but I worry.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.517
- We can ride out and meet 'em.

17:31.583 --> 17:32.651
- Thank you, Zane.

17:33.685 --> 17:34.987
- When he's done
with this colt.

17:35.053 --> 17:38.190
We ain't exactly
in a stopping place.

17:38.257 --> 17:39.391
- Come on!

17:40.893 --> 17:44.463
- Why danger gives men such
pleasure I'll never understand.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.064
[shouting]

17:50.769 --> 17:52.337
- Let's go.
- Come on, Jack!

17:52.404 --> 17:53.705
- That'll do for the day, Jack.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.507
Grab a user.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.042
We gonna go find your father.

17:57.109 --> 17:59.511
- He lost?
- Doubt it.

17:59.578 --> 18:00.979
- Then why are we
going to find him?

18:01.046 --> 18:03.782
- Because I asked.
I also asked you to be careful.

18:03.849 --> 18:06.418
A plaster cast on your wedding
day will please no one,

18:06.485 --> 18:07.786
least of all your bride.

18:07.853 --> 18:10.489
- God ain't made one that
can get me off, auntie.

18:10.556 --> 18:12.791
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't you worry, Aunt Cara.

18:12.858 --> 18:15.627
In a week you could pick apples
off this horse in the orchard.

18:15.694 --> 18:17.496
- I'll stick to my buggy,
thank you very much.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.499
- All right.
Zane: Good job today, Jack.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.371
[music]

18:35.414 --> 18:37.850
Woman: Name the ingredients
of soap.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.320
Name them.

18:41.386 --> 18:43.922
- Oil, lye, and water.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.058
- What kind of oil?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.960
- Any kind.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.798
- I prefer your answers
without the flippance.

18:52.865 --> 18:56.568
Now, what kind of oil?

18:56.635 --> 18:59.171
- You can use vegetable oil,
or tallow.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.439
- How do you get tallow?

19:00.506 --> 19:02.474
- You render animal fat.
- How do you render it?

19:02.541 --> 19:04.710
- You boil it.

19:04.776 --> 19:06.211
- What is lye?

19:08.914 --> 19:10.482
- It's...

19:13.785 --> 19:16.088
It's from ashes.

19:16.154 --> 19:19.057
- What is from ashes?

19:19.124 --> 19:22.728
[music]

19:22.794 --> 19:24.263
- The Alkaline?

19:24.329 --> 19:26.231
- [gasps]
- Alkali.

19:26.298 --> 19:27.933
How do you get alkali?

19:28.567 --> 19:30.836
[ruler slap]

19:31.870 --> 19:33.372
How?

19:33.438 --> 19:35.073
- I don't know.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.376
- [slap] Why don't you know?
It was in yesterday's lecture.

19:37.442 --> 19:39.945
- I can't rememb--
- Yes, you do.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.214

I don't!

20:14.713 --> 20:18.283
- I wonder what precipitated
her attack on you, Sister Mary.

20:18.350 --> 20:21.553
- I'm sure I've no idea, Father.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.922
A wild animal, this one.

20:26.191 --> 20:27.659
- Show me your hands, child.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.770
- You must beat this like
a mule to get a simple answer

20:38.837 --> 20:42.507
the remainder of the class
has already answered.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.510
- What was the question
you couldn't answer?

20:45.577 --> 20:47.179
- She-she w-w-was asking m-me
about s-s-soap.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.615
And-and I s-s-aid
alkaline instead of alkali.

20:58.390 --> 20:59.825
- Sister Mary,
step forward, please.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.662
[music]

21:13.038 --> 21:15.140
Would you place your hands
on the desk, please?

21:23.849 --> 21:27.786
Would you recite 1 Corinthians
Chapter 13, verse one, please.

21:31.556 --> 21:34.259
- "If I speak in
the tongues of men..."

21:38.263 --> 21:40.032
- Continue.
- [sobs]

21:42.000 --> 21:44.036
- "And Angels--"

21:46.104 --> 21:49.341
"But have not love--"

21:49.408 --> 21:52.511
- Speak the verse, sister.

21:53.578 --> 21:57.549
- "I am a noisy gong
or a cymbal..."

21:57.616 --> 21:58.550
"Clanging cymbal

21:58.617 --> 22:00.585

22:00.652 --> 22:02.154

22:02.220 --> 22:03.955

22:04.022 --> 22:05.424

22:05.490 --> 22:06.558

- Faster!

22:10.295 --> 22:12.464

[sobbing]

22:16.368 --> 22:17.903
Please, Father. Please.

22:19.538 --> 22:22.074
- Look at that, Sister Mary.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.709
You beat the child,

22:23.775 --> 22:26.478
and yet she begs
for mercy on your behalf.

22:26.545 --> 22:28.113
Perhaps she should
be the teacher.

22:28.914 --> 22:30.515
- Eh?
- [Crying]

22:41.226 --> 22:42.861
[sniffles]

22:47.232 --> 22:51.303
I understand your desire
to lash out at a sister

22:51.369 --> 22:53.238
who lacks compassion, but...

22:55.807 --> 22:58.777
You lash out,

22:58.844 --> 23:00.679
all will lash out.

23:07.252 --> 23:09.387
I have compassion
for you, my child.

23:11.189 --> 23:12.390
I do.

23:16.695 --> 23:19.030
Place your hands
on the shelves, please.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.535
[music]

23:31.076 --> 23:35.480
I have compassion, but...

and place them beside your bath.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.017
Enter the bath.

24:27.265 --> 24:32.037
Grab the soap and rub
the soap into your washcloth.

24:37.375 --> 24:38.743
Begin with your neck.

24:47.786 --> 24:49.654
Rub under each arm.

24:52.257 --> 24:53.425

on the side of the wash bin.

Stand and wrap the towel

Step from the tub.

Remove your towel.

Cover yourself.

Turn 'round.

27:34.853 --> 27:37.856
We understand each
other now, I think. Yes?

27:39.024 --> 27:40.158
- Yes, sister.

27:42.660 --> 27:47.999
- Best for both of us stay
clear of his office, then.

27:48.066 --> 27:49.834
- Yes, sister.

27:54.606 --> 27:58.743

31:39.764 --> 31:41.332
When you want to
push the herd up?

31:41.399 --> 31:43.868
- Uh, Zane,
gather them up tomorrow.

31:43.935 --> 31:45.403
We'll push up on Wednesday.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.674
- That's three days up, hold 'em
for a few days, two days back?

31:49.741 --> 31:51.075
- Something like that.

31:51.142 --> 31:54.345
- That does not get him
to the church on time.

31:54.412 --> 31:55.780
- I thought the wedding
was on Saturday.

31:55.847 --> 31:57.282
- Wednesday, sir.

31:57.348 --> 31:59.217
- Who the hell gets
married on a Wednesday?

31:59.284 --> 32:01.319
- Don't know, sir.
I guess just me.

32:01.386 --> 32:02.620
- Why the hell'd you pick it?

32:02.687 --> 32:04.956
- They left me out
of the picking, sir.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.557
- Oh, Jesus. These cattle
can't wait a week.

32:06.624 --> 32:07.659
- I know it.

32:07.725 --> 32:09.427
- I'll take a crew
and drive them.

32:09.494 --> 32:10.928
- If there's a drive I'm on it.

32:10.995 --> 32:15.366
It's my job and we're
short-handed enough...

32:15.433 --> 32:16.968
- We can postpone the wedding

32:17.035 --> 32:19.871
or we can postpone the drive
and we can't postpone the drive.

32:19.937 --> 32:22.407
So you gotta tell your bride
her wedding's got to wait a week

32:22.473 --> 32:24.742
so you can sleep on the
ground and drive cattle.

32:24.809 --> 32:26.778

32:26.844 --> 32:28.479
Don't know why the
wedding should be any different

32:28.546 --> 32:31.249

that's the way it's gonna be.

32:32.583 --> 32:33.851
You tell her just
like that, son.

32:33.918 --> 32:35.753
I want to see how
that goes over.

32:35.820 --> 32:38.623
- Hell, it's true, though.
How many birthdays did you miss?

32:38.690 --> 32:40.625
- It may be true, but you
need to find a better way

32:40.692 --> 32:44.295
to tell her, or there ain't
gonna be any wedding at all.

32:44.362 --> 32:45.963
You let me break it
to the boss first,

- A lot of people,
not much work.

33:19.364 --> 33:21.532
Expect a letter from
the Temperance Society.

33:21.599 --> 33:24.502

They are persistent.

33:24.569 --> 33:25.970
- Yeah.

33:26.037 --> 33:28.906
I gotta run our
herd up the mountain.

The neighbors' herds, too.

they're all gonna die.

- When?

33:38.082 --> 33:39.951
- Start gathering tomorrow.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.789
- The wedding's in a week, Jake.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.125
Does that mean you
won't be there?

33:47.191 --> 33:49.360
- Nobody's gonna be there.

33:49.427 --> 33:50.795
The whole valley's
pushing cattle.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.131

Well, I'll talk to
the girl's mother tomorrow.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.971
I don't see what
harm two weeks would do.

34:00.037 --> 34:02.640
- Jack said he'd handle it.

34:02.707 --> 34:05.343
- Okay, Jacob.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.678
- It's his wedding.

34:07.745 --> 34:09.514
- The wedding's
for the woman, Jake.

34:09.580 --> 34:12.283
If it were for men,
we would've spat on our hands

34:12.350 --> 34:15.019
and shook on it, and then
you would've bent me

34:15.086 --> 34:19.924
over the first thing you could
find that would hold our weight.

34:19.991 --> 34:22.026
- That's not far from
how it happened, honey.

34:23.027 --> 34:24.028
- [chuckles]

34:26.464 --> 34:28.533
It's the one day
in a woman's life

34:28.599 --> 34:31.002
that is dedicated
solely to her.

34:31.068 --> 34:32.737
And you're going to
let that boy tell her

34:32.804 --> 34:35.873
that "moving cattle
is more important."

34:35.940 --> 34:39.510
- She's the daughter
of a rancher, honey.

34:39.577 --> 34:42.013
I doubt it'd come
as much of a surprise.

34:51.222 --> 34:52.490
- Well, how long?

34:52.557 --> 34:54.459
- A week or two.

34:54.525 --> 34:55.960
- Or two?

34:56.027 --> 34:57.595
- Your daddy's a rancher, honey.
You know the deal.

34:57.662 --> 34:58.896
These cattle
got their work clothes on

34:58.963 --> 35:00.431
and they need some help.

35:00.498 --> 35:01.599
- Why do I have to wait a week?

35:01.666 --> 35:02.934
Why can't the cattle
wait a week?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.236
- Because the cattle will
be dead in a week.

35:05.303 --> 35:07.605
Look, I can't wait
to get married either,

35:07.672 --> 35:10.341
and I'd never ask
if this wasn't important.

35:10.408 --> 35:12.410
- Important?

35:12.477 --> 35:15.112
Yes, Jack, tell me
how important the cattle are.

35:15.179 --> 35:16.747
And you know what,
while they're so important

35:16.814 --> 35:19.083
here's an idea:
why don't you marry one?

35:19.150 --> 35:21.586
And when you get to
the top of the hill,

35:21.652 --> 35:23.120
you have yourself a honeymoon.

35:25.556 --> 35:27.024
[door slams]

35:30.294 --> 35:31.762
[screams]

35:36.868 --> 35:38.569
[music]

35:50.815 --> 35:52.049
- Looks like I'm too late.

35:54.018 --> 35:55.720
How poorly did she take it?

35:55.786 --> 35:58.022
- Well, she told me to, uh...

35:58.089 --> 36:01.826
to marry a cow and to take
it up the mountain...

36:01.893 --> 36:03.694
and... and...

36:03.761 --> 36:05.796
- Well, that's
quite an image.

36:05.863 --> 36:09.166
Go on, go back to the ranch,
I'll sort this out for you.

36:09.233 --> 36:11.168
- I think I'd better stay
in case she wants to see me.

36:11.235 --> 36:12.570
- She will.
She will want to see you,

36:12.637 --> 36:14.539
and then you will just say
something stupid

36:14.605 --> 36:16.474
and then she won't want
to see you anymore.

36:16.541 --> 36:17.742
- I'm pretty worried, Auntie.

36:17.808 --> 36:19.010
I ain't gonna be much
use on the ranch.

36:19.076 --> 36:20.311
- You should be worried.

36:20.378 --> 36:22.113
Go on, go back to the ranch.

36:22.179 --> 36:23.614
Go on, quick,
off you go.

36:23.681 --> 36:25.750
[music]

36:28.986 --> 36:29.987
Go on.

36:38.829 --> 36:40.498
- I don't ever want...

36:42.300 --> 36:43.501
Mrs. Dutton.

36:43.568 --> 36:44.835
Good afternoon...

36:44.902 --> 36:46.871
- Well, certainly
not a dull one.

36:48.506 --> 36:50.341
Are your parents home?

36:50.408 --> 36:52.310
- Daddy's tending to the cattle,

36:52.376 --> 36:57.848
and mother's in Bozeman making
preparations for the....

36:57.915 --> 37:00.284
- I know, I know.

37:00.351 --> 37:01.986
Can we speak, Elizabeth?

37:03.621 --> 37:04.722
- Yes.

37:14.699 --> 37:18.202
You know, I admire you.

37:18.269 --> 37:21.372
And the opportunities
you've had.

37:21.439 --> 37:25.076
I regret not sending
Jack back east for school.

37:25.142 --> 37:26.644
I feel sometimes that
we've robbed him

37:26.711 --> 37:28.379
of countless experiences,

37:28.446 --> 37:31.349
all of which you've had.

37:31.415 --> 37:33.584
But what you haven't
had, however,

37:33.651 --> 37:37.788
is an education about
this way of life.

37:37.855 --> 37:41.392
You will miss more than
weddings for cattle, my dear.

37:41.459 --> 37:44.328
If you give birth
during calving season

37:44.395 --> 37:48.733
it will be a month before
he sees his first child.

37:48.799 --> 37:51.936
If you give birth in the fall
it will be even longer.

37:52.003 --> 37:55.406
You will stand knee deep
in mud to help a sick foal.

37:55.473 --> 37:57.608
You will drive
wagons through blizzards

37:57.675 --> 38:00.478
with hay for cattle
and hear them screaming

38:00.544 --> 38:02.313
their gratitude when
you approach.

38:04.649 --> 38:07.752
And you will be free

38:07.818 --> 38:11.088
in a way that most people
can barely conceive.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.929
Now, if this is not
the life you want,

38:18.996 --> 38:21.499
you must tell the boy now.

38:21.565 --> 38:23.768
Because you have to want
more than the boy,

38:23.834 --> 38:25.636
you have to want the life, too.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.906
Because in this life,
there's no debating

38:28.973 --> 38:31.175
which is more important:
the wedding or the cattle.

38:31.242 --> 38:32.777
It's always the cattle.

38:37.381 --> 38:40.651
- He makes me dizzy
when I'm with him

38:40.718 --> 38:42.319
and I can't breathe
without him.

38:45.423 --> 38:47.024
I don't know the life.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.294
But I will learn it.

38:51.362 --> 38:53.230
- It's settled then.

38:53.297 --> 38:56.233
We'll have the wedding
two weeks from Saturday.

38:57.435 --> 38:58.602
- Okay.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.106
- He left.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.841
[mock surprise]
- Oh, that he did.

39:03.908 --> 39:05.710
Well, he's very impulsive.

39:05.776 --> 39:07.978
- Will you take me to him?
Please?

39:08.045 --> 39:10.314
- We'll leave your
father a note.

39:22.126 --> 39:23.527
[music]

39:24.528 --> 39:25.896
- I see him.

39:25.963 --> 39:27.064
- Well, what do you know?

39:27.131 --> 39:28.766
Elizabeth: Will you
stop, please?

39:28.833 --> 39:31.135
- We'll see him up at the house,
after he's cleaned up a bit.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.703
I can smell him from here.

39:37.341 --> 39:38.676
[grunts]

39:46.350 --> 39:47.651
[laughing]

39:47.718 --> 39:49.954
- I never want to fight
with you again.

39:50.020 --> 39:51.455
Don't you ever do
that to me.

39:54.458 --> 39:55.726
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

39:56.694 --> 39:58.295
- That my daughter?

39:58.362 --> 40:01.665
- Well, if it ain't, my nephew's
got some explaining to do.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.634
- He's got some
explaining to do anyway.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.503
They ain't married yet.

40:05.569 --> 40:07.138
- They're as good
as married, Bob.

40:07.204 --> 40:08.739
- What's that supposed to mean?

40:08.806 --> 40:12.076
- In my experience, Bob:
when the first baby comes,

40:12.143 --> 40:17.114
you don't want to be too picky
with your math and a calendar.

40:17.181 --> 40:19.183
[cattle lowing]

40:19.884 --> 40:20.918
- Lord.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.623
[music]

40:28.058 --> 40:29.460
[coughing]

40:58.889 --> 41:00.791
[sheep bleating]

41:07.765 --> 41:08.799
[tongue clicking]

41:14.338 --> 41:15.873
- What's a fence
doing way up here?

41:15.940 --> 41:19.009
- I don't know.
Shouldn't be here.

41:19.076 --> 41:22.446
- Well, it's here.

41:23.848 --> 41:25.449
- That fucking Dutton.

41:25.516 --> 41:29.119
Fencing the world out of
grass he can't even reach.

41:29.186 --> 41:31.188
I'm not watching my sheep die

41:31.255 --> 41:36.927
while there's grass a foot
tall no cattle could ever graze.

41:36.994 --> 41:38.095
Cut it.

41:41.599 --> 41:43.667
[music]

41:57.581 --> 41:58.849
- Bring them through.

42:11.729 --> 42:13.364
[bleating]

42:37.521 --> 42:42.693
[music]

42:42.760 --> 42:44.762
[singing, chanting]

43:43.420 --> 43:45.155
[distant gunfire]

43:49.827 --> 43:52.129
[explosions, gunfire]

44:19.123 --> 44:21.558
- There's thousands of them.
We gotta fall back, all right?

44:21.625 --> 44:24.094
- I can't my leg's broken.
- You gotta run!

44:31.735 --> 44:32.803
[gunshot]

44:39.710 --> 44:41.145
[shouting]

44:41.211 --> 44:43.414
[grunts]

44:49.319 --> 44:50.988
[growling]

44:58.462 --> 44:59.963
Ah!

45:03.100 --> 45:06.670
[grunting]

45:08.439 --> 45:11.008
[panting]

45:11.075 --> 45:12.943
- We have reached
Nairobi, sir.

45:13.010 --> 45:14.244
The journey is over, sir.

45:14.311 --> 45:16.480
This is your destination.

45:27.124 --> 45:28.659
- I have no destination.

45:30.461 --> 45:31.728
- You have a ticket for Nairobi?

45:31.795 --> 45:33.030
- I do.

45:33.097 --> 45:34.998
- Then you have reached
your destination, sir.

45:35.065 --> 45:36.867
- I've reached my next stop.
That's all this is.

45:38.135 --> 45:40.671
Apologies for the scare.

45:40.737 --> 45:42.573
I don't wake well.

45:42.639 --> 45:44.708
- No sir, I'd say you don't.

45:46.910 --> 45:50.380
[music]

45:53.917 --> 45:55.452
[chattering]

46:45.035 --> 46:46.270
- I've spiked the tents
to the ground

46:46.336 --> 46:47.838
so tight a wood lice
can't get under them.

46:47.905 --> 46:51.408
I've moved the cots to the
center of each quarter.

46:51.475 --> 46:52.809
- Sure it's the same leopard?

46:52.876 --> 46:54.444
- Look at the size of it.

46:57.181 --> 46:58.882
- Yeah. That's the same leopard.

46:58.949 --> 47:00.184
- Tried to get into this tent.

47:01.785 --> 47:04.588
Guest took a shot at it.

47:07.491 --> 47:09.326
- No blood trail?

47:09.393 --> 47:10.961
- He missed.

47:11.028 --> 47:14.231
- Lucky he didn't shoot
whoever sleeps in that tent.

47:14.298 --> 47:15.632
- That's why I'm moving the
guests to the river camp

47:15.699 --> 47:19.102
until you can rid the world
of this spotted bastard.

47:19.169 --> 47:20.837
- I'd prefer if you didn't.

47:20.904 --> 47:22.940
You're taking away all my bait.

47:23.006 --> 47:25.576
- No, no, I brought
you up some goats.

47:25.642 --> 47:28.579
- Well, goats ain't the same,
are they?

47:28.645 --> 47:30.781
Once they get a taste for man,
man is all they want to eat.

47:32.249 --> 47:33.917
Not to worry, Holland.

47:33.984 --> 47:36.753
We'll be the bait.
- [laughs]

47:36.820 --> 47:38.188
- I have a tent
for you over here.

47:38.255 --> 47:39.957
- Away from the rest, yeah?

47:40.023 --> 47:41.158
- Only way to get
it deeper in the bush

47:41.225 --> 47:43.760
would be to drop
it from the sky.

47:43.827 --> 47:46.063
[music]

47:52.135 --> 47:53.337
[bleating]

48:12.122 --> 48:14.458
- By God, you're mad, man.

48:14.524 --> 48:16.994
I suggest you use
the goats, Dutton.

48:17.060 --> 48:18.962
- I think we'll use
ourselves instead.

48:19.029 --> 48:20.964
- Yes, well, dinner is at six.

48:21.031 --> 48:24.067
I would consider being on time
since it's likely your last.

48:26.436 --> 48:27.838
- Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

48:38.215 --> 48:46.890
[chattering]

48:46.957 --> 48:49.326
- Must've been
quite the accident.

48:51.495 --> 48:52.863
- No, ma'am,
that was no accident.

48:54.264 --> 48:55.465
- An American.

48:55.532 --> 48:57.067
A cowboy, no doubt.

48:57.134 --> 48:58.502
Where in America?

48:59.936 --> 49:01.538
- The mountain version
of this place.

49:01.605 --> 49:03.573
Coffee.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.509
- Coffee in the evening.

49:05.575 --> 49:08.078
No, thank you.
I'd be awake all night.

49:08.145 --> 49:09.613
- That's the plan.

49:09.680 --> 49:11.848
- I suppose I shouldn't
be surprised.

49:16.553 --> 49:18.021
- You travel here
all by yourself?

49:18.088 --> 49:19.589
- She came with
her husband, sir.

49:33.437 --> 49:35.105
- [gulps]
Mmm.

49:37.607 --> 49:38.842
[sniffs]

49:44.648 --> 49:49.186
- Up all night?
Why?

49:49.252 --> 49:51.421
- I'm hunting the thing
that's hunting you.

49:51.488 --> 49:52.956
- And what is hunting us?

49:53.023 --> 49:56.326
- A leopard
the size of a sofa.

49:56.393 --> 49:58.995
- Just arrived today.
No one mentioned a leopard.

49:59.062 --> 50:00.564
- I'm sure they didn't.

50:02.632 --> 50:04.468
Don't worry, you'll be at
the river camp tomorrow.

50:04.534 --> 50:06.303
No leopards there.

50:06.370 --> 50:09.706
Hippos and lions
and crocodiles but...

50:09.773 --> 50:11.908
no leopards.

50:11.975 --> 50:13.977
- Doesn't sound
any less dangerous.

50:16.580 --> 50:18.815
- This is Africa.

50:18.882 --> 50:20.183
Everything's dangerous.

50:23.653 --> 50:25.122
Ma'am.
[clears throat]

50:36.400 --> 50:37.834
- My goodness.

50:55.252 --> 50:56.386
[bleating]

50:57.954 --> 50:59.923
- Look what I got.

50:59.990 --> 51:01.558
- Can't hurt.
- Nope.

51:04.060 --> 51:06.963
- It's not like
a leopard to enter a tent.

51:07.030 --> 51:08.265
They ambush from behind.

51:08.331 --> 51:11.668
Lion enter tents.

51:11.735 --> 51:13.403
- Those are leopard
tracks outside.

51:13.470 --> 51:15.772
And it was at the railroad camp
37 times.

51:15.839 --> 51:18.442
- The lion is a brute.

51:18.508 --> 51:20.210
But the leopard is a thinker.

51:20.277 --> 51:23.046
He will think this
is too easy.

51:23.113 --> 51:24.614
- He already thinks
it's too easy.

51:26.049 --> 51:28.251
Keep your heads down.

51:28.318 --> 51:31.855
Stay in the tent.

51:31.922 --> 51:34.658
These English might get crazy
and start shooting at boogeymen.

51:34.724 --> 51:35.725
[laughs]

51:48.205 --> 51:49.873

[cattle lowing]

53:13.089 --> 53:14.090
- Hya, cow!

53:18.995 --> 53:20.664
- That's Brewster's crew.

53:20.730 --> 53:23.433
- Yep.

53:23.500 --> 53:26.236
- By God, we're putting
a lot of cattle on this land.

53:28.238 --> 53:30.440
- Hey, break 'em up!

53:30.507 --> 53:32.342
- Whoop!
- Hya!

53:32.409 --> 53:34.511
[shouting]

53:38.949 --> 53:40.283
- Hey!

53:45.355 --> 53:47.724
- Hey, come on!
- Hey, cow.

54:11.448 --> 54:13.316
- You ever taken
cattle this high?

54:13.383 --> 54:16.119
- Nobody takes cattle this high.

54:16.186 --> 54:18.054
I hope you been practicing
with that rifle.

54:18.121 --> 54:19.789
- I don't need the rifle.

54:19.856 --> 54:22.626
First grizzly I see,
I'm roping that son of a bitch.

54:22.692 --> 54:24.461
Ya! Ya!

54:24.527 --> 54:26.496
- Can't wait to see how
that works out for ya.

54:26.563 --> 54:27.697
- Woo!

54:32.969 --> 54:35.305
[whistling, shouting]

54:41.678 --> 54:43.213
[music]

54:57.694 --> 54:58.695
[gunshot]

55:32.028 --> 55:33.229
[groans]

55:35.665 --> 55:37.434
- They said a week?

55:37.500 --> 55:38.935
- They said about a week.

55:39.002 --> 55:42.372
That means closer to two.

55:42.439 --> 55:44.174
- I hate having them
both out for so long.

55:44.240 --> 55:46.676
- I hate having any of them
out there at all.

55:46.743 --> 55:48.545
But they're cowboys, Emma.
It's what they do.

55:49.779 --> 55:51.448
- I'll start working on dinner.

55:51.514 --> 55:55.852
- No need.
There's no one to feed.

55:55.919 --> 55:57.687
Let's have sandwiches.

55:57.754 --> 56:02.225
- Can't serve just sandwiches.
I'll make a soup.

56:02.292 --> 56:03.393
- Suit yourself.

56:06.262 --> 56:08.998
- You coming?

56:09.065 --> 56:10.700
- Mmm.

56:10.767 --> 56:12.736
No.

56:12.802 --> 56:16.339
No, I think I'll stay
out here a bit.

56:18.274 --> 56:20.110
[music]

56:41.464 --> 56:44.367
My Dearest Spencer...

56:44.434 --> 56:46.236
Summer is here,
and with it a pestilence

56:46.302 --> 56:49.739
of locust and
a plague of drought.

56:49.806 --> 56:51.674
Your uncle and brother
and young Jack

56:51.741 --> 56:54.310
are pushing the herd
into the mountains in hopes

56:54.377 --> 56:57.013
of finding greener
grass there.

56:57.080 --> 56:59.983
We postponed Jack's wedding
because, as you know,

57:00.049 --> 57:02.585
the herd comes first.

57:04.821 --> 57:06.556
When the house is
full and the ranch is busy

57:06.623 --> 57:09.325
I can lose myself
in the hurry of it,

57:09.392 --> 57:12.061
and forget you are not here.

57:12.128 --> 57:15.732
But the house is empty now,
and I've no chores left.

57:15.799 --> 57:19.536
And so I think of you.

57:19.602 --> 57:23.940
And wonder why...
Why won't you come home to us?

57:25.975 --> 57:28.111
[music]

57:53.102 --> 57:54.838
[rustling]

57:54.904 --> 57:56.206
[low growl]

57:59.509 --> 58:00.577
[peeing]

58:08.351 --> 58:09.352
[roar]

58:17.894 --> 58:19.095
- [growl]
- [gagging]

58:22.699 --> 58:23.867
[growling]

58:38.481 --> 58:41.117
- [Cara] I can't help but think
your absence is punishment,

58:41.184 --> 58:45.355
that somehow we are
the reason you won't return.

58:45.421 --> 58:47.457
That's selfish, I suppose.

58:47.523 --> 58:50.226
War changes men, I know.

58:50.293 --> 58:52.161
I can only assume
you are seeking

58:52.228 --> 58:54.797
the part of yourself you lost.

58:54.864 --> 58:57.800
And I can only pray
that you find it

58:57.867 --> 59:00.236
and come back to us.

59:00.303 --> 59:01.638
[growling]

59:07.176 --> 59:08.511
[gunshot]

59:11.915 --> 59:14.350
[music]

59:24.894 --> 59:26.362
- You were right.
It was too easy for him.

59:30.199 --> 59:32.435
- Spencer, there are two!

59:33.970 --> 59:34.938
[roars]

59:35.004 --> 59:38.041
[music]

59:47.583 --> 59:50.420
[music]

1:00:29.792 --> 1:00:30.793
[music]
