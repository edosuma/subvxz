to agree with that?

07:18.829 --> 07:21.441
[engine rumbling]

07:24.618 --> 07:27.011
- [sighs]
Come here.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.013
[both grunt and kiss]

07:29.057 --> 07:30.362
Ugh, I gotta go.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.234
I don't know
why my friends are still here.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.018
- Okay. Well, I guess
I'll see you soon?

07:34.062 --> 07:35.672
- I don't know.
Maybe, Sal.

07:35.716 --> 07:36.847
- My name's James.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.502
- Goodbye, Sal.

07:39.546 --> 07:43.245
Ooh, yeah! Get it!
[chuckles]

07:43.288 --> 07:45.334
[sighs]

07:45.377 --> 07:46.814
- Nicky, what are you doing?

07:46.857 --> 07:48.555
- And did you buy a motorcycle?

07:48.598 --> 07:51.034
- It's a rental.
I was feeling adventurous.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.515
- When did you get
your motorcycle license?

07:52.558 --> 07:54.865
- You need a special license
for a motorcycle? Huh.

07:54.909 --> 07:57.651
- Nicky, can we talk about
what you're going through?

07:57.694 --> 07:58.956
- No. I don't need to talk.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.349
I don't need you guys
waiting around for me.

08:00.392 --> 08:02.133
I don't understand why you guys
are still here.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.528
- Whoopi Goldberg!

08:05.572 --> 08:07.704
- Whoa, are you serious
right now?

08:07.748 --> 08:08.923
You're pulling the Whoopi card?

08:08.966 --> 08:10.533
- What the hell is
"the Whoopi card"?

08:10.577 --> 08:12.230
- Last year, Nicky and I
had a movie night,

08:12.274 --> 08:13.841
and we watched
her favorite film, "Ghost."

08:13.884 --> 08:15.538
- Perfect film. No notes.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.148
- And then afterwards,
we stayed up all night,

08:17.192 --> 08:18.367
getting real about our lives.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.890
And we made a promise
to ourselves

08:19.934 --> 08:21.501
that if either of us
ever held back

08:21.544 --> 08:22.414
our true feelings,

08:22.457 --> 08:24.068
we could play the Whoopi card.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.679
- Cool.
Thanks for the backstory.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.245
- So I'm using the Whoopi card.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.421
'Cause, Nicky,
you in danger, girl.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.729
- What am I supposed to do,
Fay, make new friends? Ew!

08:32.773 --> 08:34.251
- Well, yeah.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.645
- Well, I don't want to,
though.

08:35.688 --> 08:37.647
- I totally understand.
I'm gonna miss you too.

08:37.691 --> 08:38.779
But I'm not dying.

08:38.822 --> 08:39.823
I'm just moving to New York.

08:39.866 --> 08:41.563
We can still be friends.
- True.

08:41.607 --> 08:43.827
- We can do everything
we do now, just on FaceTime.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.003
- You're right. I guess it
won't be so different.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.527
- Right.
- Exactly.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.919
- You know what?
I wish I could handle it

08:48.963 --> 08:50.007
as well as you, Anthony.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.748
You're so strong.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.228
- Yeah, I guess I am.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.925
- You know, I'm a mess,

08:54.969 --> 08:55.970
and my friendship with Fay

08:56.013 --> 08:57.711
is pretty much gonna stay
the same.

08:57.754 --> 09:01.192
But your relationship,
it's D-E-A-D, it's dead.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.151
And look at you,
walking around just fine.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.761
- Yeah, totally fine.

09:04.805 --> 09:07.329
- Yeah, I mean, I could
FaceTime Fay any time I want,

09:07.372 --> 09:10.201
but you? Oh, you'll never kiss

09:10.245 --> 09:13.596
or embrace her again
in a sexual way.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.771
But you're fine.

09:14.815 --> 09:15.859
- Right.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.295
- I feel better.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.645
I'm gonna be strong like you,
Anthony.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.255
- Good. I love you.

09:20.298 --> 09:21.778
- I love you too.
Now hug me.

09:21.822 --> 09:22.866
- Okay

09:22.910 --> 09:24.346
- [chuckles]

09:24.389 --> 09:25.608
- Mm, you smell like a satchel.

09:25.652 --> 09:26.740
- Do you wanna get on the bike
and go for--

09:26.783 --> 09:28.568
- No.
- Absolutely not.

09:28.611 --> 09:29.612
- There you are.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.483
The suspense
has been killing us.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.442
Now, who are you gonna take
to dinner?

09:33.485 --> 09:34.574
- Okay.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.619
After a long night
of deliberation,

09:36.663 --> 09:38.229
I have decided

09:38.273 --> 09:39.230
that I'm still undecided...

09:39.274 --> 09:40.492
- Oh, come on!
- Damn!

09:40.536 --> 09:43.452
- Which means it's time
for round two.

09:43.495 --> 09:44.627
- Fine.
- Let's go.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.150
- So I've put together
some scenarios

09:46.194 --> 09:47.543
to help me come
to a decision.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.850
Contestant number one,
we're at Dirty Sexy Money.

09:49.893 --> 09:50.894
- Dirt & Honey.
- Whatever.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.287
We order some cocktails,

09:52.330 --> 09:54.158
and mine is too spicy.

09:54.202 --> 09:55.333
What do you do?
- Easy.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.726
I politely wave down the
server,

09:56.770 --> 09:58.206
tell him that your drink
was unsatisfactory

09:58.249 --> 09:59.163
and that we'd like
a replacement

09:59.207 --> 10:00.164
with much less spice.

10:00.208 --> 10:01.818
- Mm, interesting.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.341
Contestant number two,
what's your response?

10:03.385 --> 10:05.169
- Trick question.
Sherm love the spice.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.606
- And the spice love Sherm.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.216
Point, contestant number two.
- Yes!

10:08.259 --> 10:09.739
- You know you can use
our names, right?

10:09.783 --> 10:12.655
- You remain nameless
until I name a winner.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.091
Next question.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.006
We just finished eating,
and it was amazing,

10:16.050 --> 10:18.356
mostly because of my hot takes.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.358
Where will you take me
after dinner?

10:20.402 --> 10:21.664
Contestant number one,
we'll start with you.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.623
- Oh, well, there's
this really dope wine bar

10:23.666 --> 10:25.059
called Mignon
which is close by.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.278
Figure we could go there
for a nightcap post dinner.

10:27.322 --> 10:28.628
- [chuckles] That's lame.

10:28.671 --> 10:29.977
I'd take you
to a Clippers game.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.021
- You're pandering.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.762
I'm more
than just a Clippers fan.

10:32.806 --> 10:33.807
Point, contestant number one.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.679
- [laughs]
- Damn it.

10:36.723 --> 10:40.030
- Hey, so, I think something
might be up with Anthony now.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.162
- What makes you say that?

10:41.205 --> 10:42.816
- Well, yesterday,
after you said

10:42.859 --> 10:44.382
that our relationship was dying

10:44.426 --> 10:45.906
and that
he might never kiss me again,

10:45.949 --> 10:47.559
he started acting really weird.

10:47.603 --> 10:50.214
And then we went out to dinner,
and he spent a lot of money.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.563
Like, a lot.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.217
- Thank you for dining with us
this evening.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.218
Would you mind
if I take the check?

10:54.262 --> 10:56.743
- Oh, for sure.
Here you go.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.309
- Holy [bleep]!

10:58.353 --> 11:00.094
Are you sure about this?
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.096
- [stammering] I mean, I--

11:02.139 --> 11:03.401
did you see this?
- I--

11:03.445 --> 11:05.186
He tipped the waiter 400%.
It was crazy.

11:05.229 --> 11:06.535
- Damn.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.102
Usually he, like,
throws himself into work,

11:08.145 --> 11:09.886
but when he is really
going through it,

11:09.930 --> 11:10.974
he stress-spends.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.584
- But he's an accountant.
- I know.

11:12.628 --> 11:15.283
It's his dirty, freaky,
nasty little secret.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.893
- Oh, I feel terrible.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.809
First, I messed up your life,
and now I'm messing up his?

11:19.853 --> 11:21.942
We should probably check on him
before he goes bankrupt.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.770
- Let's hop on my hog.
- What?

11:23.813 --> 11:25.075
- I have the motorcycle
for another week.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.381
Trust me, you're gonna love it.

11:26.424 --> 11:29.601
[funk music]

11:29.645 --> 11:30.864
♪

11:30.907 --> 11:32.909
- Gentlemen, I know this
is taking some time,

11:32.953 --> 11:34.737
but no one said it would be
easy figuring out

11:34.781 --> 11:36.913
who would be my plus-one
to Sand & Syrup.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.349
- It is Dirt & Honey.

11:38.393 --> 11:41.613
- Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
Because I don't care.

11:41.657 --> 11:44.181
Now, it's time for the third
and final round.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.400
- Okay.
- So what's up?

11:45.443 --> 11:47.445
- I'm very excited to announce

11:47.489 --> 11:50.710
that we have a new challenger
entering the competition.

11:50.753 --> 11:51.711
both: Ron Ron?

11:51.754 --> 11:53.016
- What up, man?

11:53.060 --> 11:54.365
Thanks for having me.

11:54.409 --> 11:55.584
Happy to throw my hat
into the ring, man.

11:55.627 --> 11:56.803
- What?
- Come on.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.326
- I thought you guys were
on bad terms.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.806
- Oh, we settled
our differences.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.503
Ron Ron's the homey again.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.418
- And I've always wanted
to go to Gin & Rummy.

12:03.461 --> 12:04.680
both: Dirt & Honey!

12:04.724 --> 12:05.899
- Tomato, tomato.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.204
- I can't believe this.

12:07.248 --> 12:08.771
- Sherm, I got
two Clippers tickets

12:08.815 --> 12:09.946
with your name on it.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.643
- Mm, that's pandering.
And I like it.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.297
- You didn't like it
when I did it before.

12:13.341 --> 12:16.648
- What can I say?
Another classic Sherm 180.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.346
- You know what?
I've had enough.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.087
This competition is wack.
I'm out.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.132
- What?
- Me too.

12:22.176 --> 12:23.699
- We almost done!

12:23.743 --> 12:27.007
[chuckles] Well, looks like
you win by default, Ron Ron.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.443
- A win's a win.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.488
Thanks again, man.
- [chuckles]

12:30.532 --> 12:33.317
[knocking on door]

12:33.361 --> 12:34.449
- I still can't believe
how good you are

12:34.492 --> 12:35.624
at riding a motorcycle.

12:35.667 --> 12:36.886
- I know, right?

12:36.930 --> 12:40.368
My secret is,
I'm very good at everything.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.980
- Hey.
What are you guys doing here?

12:44.024 --> 12:45.808
- Hey, um,

12:45.852 --> 12:47.723
we were just a little worried
about you.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.985
- What? Why?

12:49.029 --> 12:51.422
- You know, because
of all the overspending?

12:51.466 --> 12:53.468
- I have no idea what you guys
are talking about.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.383
Oh, uh, can you guys move
to the side, please?

12:55.426 --> 12:57.951
Fourth flatscreen just arrived.
- Fourth?

12:57.994 --> 12:59.822
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:04.435 --> 13:04.784
.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.830
- Ooh, ooh-whee.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.571
- Y'all want
some vegan chocolate fondue?

13:09.614 --> 13:10.572
It's delicious.

13:10.615 --> 13:11.965
- Good lord, Anthony.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.793
How much money did you spend
in the last 48 yours?

13:13.836 --> 13:14.881
- Oh, not too much.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.534
I got good deals
on all this stuff.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.972
Oh, and Fay,
I got you something.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.062
Yeah.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.759
- Oh, wow.
- It's vegan.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.847
- How much did that cost?

13:24.891 --> 13:25.935
- Not much.
Just a couple racks.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.937
- A couple of racks?
- What?

13:27.981 --> 13:29.243
Anthony, this is
really thoughtful and all,

13:29.286 --> 13:30.853
but if you were doing
the accounting

13:30.897 --> 13:31.941
on all these purchases,

13:31.985 --> 13:34.204
how would you classify
all this?

13:34.248 --> 13:36.946
- Um, well, gifts,
dining and entertainment,

13:36.990 --> 13:38.861
home office
furniture and equipment,

13:38.905 --> 13:40.036
miscellaneous.

13:40.080 --> 13:40.994
- And what would you tell
someone

13:41.037 --> 13:42.299
who was spending this much?

13:42.343 --> 13:45.128
- I'd tell them, "great job."
[laughs]

13:45.172 --> 13:47.043
- Anthony.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.611
- Yeah, I'd tell them,
"great job ruining your life."

13:49.654 --> 13:50.655
Oh, no!

13:50.699 --> 13:52.005
Patrick Swayze!

13:52.048 --> 13:53.310
- The hell are you
talking about?

13:53.354 --> 13:55.095
- Patrick Swayze from "Ghost"?
- I know him.

13:55.138 --> 13:57.662
- I figured since I'm a guy,
I'd, you know, use Swayze.

13:57.706 --> 13:58.881
- Well, that's kind of dumb.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.448
Also, "Ghost" is kind of like
our thing.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.015
- Be nice.
- All right.

14:05.409 --> 14:08.151
- Hey, what's going on?

14:08.195 --> 14:09.500
- I just--

14:09.544 --> 14:11.546
I was doing well until Nicky
started talking

14:11.589 --> 14:12.982
about how you and I were done.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.157
- We'll always be friends.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.898
- Yeah, but done romantically.

14:15.942 --> 14:19.032
It just hit me,
and it hit me hard.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.250
Guess I just channeled all my
feelings

14:20.294 --> 14:22.252
into all
these crazy-ass purchases.

14:22.296 --> 14:23.732
