that in an evil place

20:02.781 --> 20:03.783
Mr. Jaggers?

20:04.284 --> 20:06.488
Be frugal with words here, Pip.

20:07.558 --> 20:10.329
Spend them like gold sovereigns.

20:12.668 --> 20:15.540
Mr. Jaggers, that man outside
in need of Â£2 and 16 shillings.

20:17.578 --> 20:18.847
Since I am now quite wealthy,

20:18.847 --> 20:20.316
I'd be happy
to give him that amount

20:20.316 --> 20:21.752
to save his son
from the gallows.

20:28.432 --> 20:29.535
Give me the check.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.456
It is such a small amount
compared to this, Mr...

20:40.456 --> 20:41.424
Pip.

20:43.696 --> 20:45.533
There. Pity.

20:46.234 --> 20:47.538
- Compassion.
- Mr. Jaggers, sir,

20:47.538 --> 20:48.607
I spoke out of weariness.

20:48.607 --> 20:49.675
Empathy.

20:49.909 --> 20:51.579
Charity.

20:51.579 --> 20:52.814
And the worst of all,
the unkindest cut of all,

20:53.516 --> 20:55.385
- kindness.
- No, please, please.

20:55.854 --> 20:56.989
Mr. Jaggers.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.795
Please, I won't make
such a suggestion again.

21:01.031 --> 21:03.503
I will explain to Mr. Rutherford
at the bank

21:04.338 --> 21:07.745
the check was damaged
in the pursuit of the education

21:07.745 --> 21:10.950
of a poor young boy
from the provinces.

21:15.660 --> 21:16.896
Mr. Jaggers,
I'm not thinking properly,

21:16.896 --> 21:17.864
Hmm.

21:19.802 --> 21:23.576
It has been a very...
eventful day.

21:25.012 --> 21:26.314
And a half.

21:28.418 --> 21:30.990
And I really,
really need to rest.

21:32.527 --> 21:34.765
My assistant, Mr. Wemmick,
will be here shortly

21:34.765 --> 21:36.334
to take you to your apartment.

21:37.403 --> 21:38.739
I have left
suitable clothing there.

21:40.075 --> 21:41.879
He will have you change
and then return.

21:42.715 --> 21:45.954
When you get back here,
you can begin work, copying.

21:51.899 --> 21:52.767
Where are you going?

21:53.670 --> 21:54.771
To save the lives of two men

21:55.607 --> 21:57.844
and to find a replacement
for the hanging judge.

22:07.798 --> 22:08.733
Father...

22:13.408 --> 22:15.780
Mr. Jaggers has made me believe
London is a very wicked place.

22:16.081 --> 22:17.785
(CHUCKLES)

22:17.785 --> 22:20.489
Well, you may get cheated,
robbed and murdered in London,

22:20.489 --> 22:22.494
but there are plenty of people
anywhere who do that for you.

22:23.963 --> 22:25.365
Only if there is bad blood.

22:26.602 --> 22:28.405
There's not much bad blood.

22:29.508 --> 22:31.545
They'll do it, if there's
anything to be got by it.

22:33.215 --> 22:34.083
That makes it worse.

22:35.486 --> 22:36.421
You think so?

22:37.591 --> 22:38.793
Much about the same,
I would say.

22:39.695 --> 22:42.568
Mr. Wemmick, you seem
to be very plain-speaking.

22:42.568 --> 22:45.506
And there is a question
I really need a plain answer to.

22:46.341 --> 22:48.680
It is not unusual
for a wealthy benefactor

22:48.680 --> 22:51.484
to wish to remain anonymous,
and that is how it will stay.

22:52.854 --> 22:53.923
But you know who it is.

22:54.190 --> 22:55.092
No, I do not.

22:56.896 --> 22:58.098
You've heard of a Miss Havisham?

22:58.866 --> 22:59.935
Indeed, I have.

23:00.302 --> 23:02.006
And a Miss Estella?

23:02.006 --> 23:03.843
Actually, it was I
who drew up the papers

23:03.843 --> 23:06.447
for Miss Estella's
legal adoption 18 years ago.

23:08.753 --> 23:09.921
Does Miss Estella
ever come here?

23:11.057 --> 23:11.992
Why would she ever come here?

23:12.794 --> 23:14.397
I don't believe
she's ever been to London.

23:15.233 --> 23:16.969
Though I suppose
she might soon come to visit

23:17.538 --> 23:18.807
to buy her wedding dress.

23:18.807 --> 23:21.679
Now, this is yours to keep.

23:23.583 --> 23:25.419
Mr. Wemmick, what wedding dress
you're talking about?

23:25.954 --> 23:28.092
Miss Estella is due to marry.
It's all arranged.

23:28.092 --> 23:30.229
I just completed due diligence
on her future husband.

23:30.229 --> 23:33.001
And he... He is a very,
very respectable gentleman.

23:33.736 --> 23:35.873
Made his money
from the import of nutmeg.

23:38.546 --> 23:40.148
Will this fucking day never end?

23:41.017 --> 23:41.952
Behold, Pip.

23:42.788 --> 23:43.723
Your new home.

23:45.092 --> 23:45.994
There. There.

23:51.071 --> 23:54.578
Yeah. The, uh, pipe from here
to the river is ruptured.

23:56.682 --> 23:57.717
It is on my list.

23:59.220 --> 24:00.623
It's a long list.

24:00.957 --> 24:02.159
One of many lists.

24:02.494 --> 24:04.898
Pip, I have a list of lists.

24:06.234 --> 24:07.236
Come on.

24:08.205 --> 24:09.508
Oh, mind that.

24:13.649 --> 24:16.054
Pip Gargery, you made it.

24:18.258 --> 24:19.995
It's me. Herbert.

24:19.995 --> 24:21.699
Good God, the boy
from the brewery.

24:22.934 --> 24:23.903
What the hell is he doing here?

24:23.903 --> 24:24.905
You know him?

24:26.241 --> 24:27.510
Yes, I'm afraid I do.

24:28.311 --> 24:29.514
HERBERT: Well, come on in.

24:30.015 --> 24:31.184
I even have butter
for the toast.

24:38.599 --> 24:39.534

24:40.837 --> 24:41.973
I could hardly sleep
knowing you were coming.

24:41.973 --> 24:42.941
Yeah.

24:43.743 --> 24:44.644
Come in!

24:51.291 --> 24:52.159
I kept the eggs
warm in my hands.

24:53.863 --> 24:54.798
I thought you would be earlier.

24:56.669 --> 24:57.938
On arrival in London,
I discovered

24:57.938 --> 24:59.273
I already had urgent business.

25:02.113 --> 25:03.816
Uh, Pip tells me
you two have met.

25:04.450 --> 25:06.856
I think we are connected
via Mr. Jaggers.

25:06.856 --> 25:08.659
Hmm. Pip beat me.

25:08.993 --> 25:10.228
Oh, beat you at what?

25:11.364 --> 25:12.700
Oh, I mean
he beat me with his fists.

25:13.368 --> 25:14.638
I was provoked.

25:15.106 --> 25:16.675
Well, it was over a girl
that we both, uh...

25:17.042 --> 25:18.245
loved.

25:18.245 --> 25:19.848
No, I didn't love her then.

25:20.550 --> 25:21.819
Should... Should I stay
and referee?

25:22.253 --> 25:23.221
No, we will be fine.

25:23.523 --> 25:24.991
We are fine.

25:25.727 --> 25:26.762
Everything is fine.

25:29.701 --> 25:32.239
Thank you, Herbert,
for making me breakfast.

25:33.308 --> 25:35.079
Thank you, Mr. Wemmick,
for showing me to my apartment.

25:35.079 --> 25:37.851
Now, if you both wouldn't mind,
I just need to...

25:47.269 --> 25:49.642
Eat your breakfast
and get some sleep.

25:49.642 --> 25:51.311
Mr. Jaggers won't return
until after dark.

25:51.311 --> 25:53.682
I'll do the copying
and credit you.

25:54.350 --> 25:56.756
No matter what Mr. Jaggers says,
even in London,

25:56.756 --> 25:58.258
kindness has its place.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.264
Then I will try to keep a place
for kindness in my heart.

26:03.001 --> 26:04.336
If you promise
not to tell Mr. Jaggers.

It would be a shame
to let the eggs go cold, Pip.

26:29.387 --> 26:31.390
I feel you are
not quite yourself today, Pip.

26:35.833 --> 26:38.037
One day ago, I was safe
with Joe and Biddy.

26:40.944 --> 26:41.912
But now, I

26:43.983 --> 26:45.286
I am looking at a boiled egg,

26:45.286 --> 26:47.389

of a high court judge,

26:47.691 --> 26:48.792
strangled.

26:51.064 --> 26:51.999
Goodness.

26:55.807 --> 26:57.777
Herbert, would you mind terribly
if I went and laid down?

26:58.879 --> 27:01.217
Of course.
I saved you the best bed.

does me harm,

30:18.078 --> 30:20.550
his name is Magwitch.
Abel Magwitch.

Escaped from Norfolk Island.

30:24.591 --> 30:25.994
Magwitch, my friend,

30:25.994 --> 30:27.229
you are quite
the miracle worker.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.937
How the hell did you
track me down?

30:30.937 --> 30:33.007
Because a man like you
will always make enemies.

30:35.045 --> 30:37.182
I escaped the colony
the day after you did

30:38.619 --> 30:41.525
and followed a trail of men
you'd robbed and swindled.

30:43.361 --> 30:46.434
I read gold had been struck
in Bathurst beyond the pass.

30:46.869 --> 30:48.304
I knew you'd go there.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.408
I knew.

Not to dig
but to swindle those that did.

wasn't even a challenge.

31:10.382 --> 31:12.185

it's not all yours to split.

The gentleman is
indeed very respectable.

Haven't you always said
you wanted nothing more

36:05.238 --> 36:06.407

to come along

36:06.407 --> 36:07.677
and take you off to Cairo
or somewhere?

36:07.677 --> 36:10.214

very respectable gentleman is?

- Nutmeg?

36:19.300 --> 36:20.837

his money from nutmeg.

Indeed.

40:35.211 --> 40:36.681
My proposition

40:37.617 --> 40:40.055
is that you and I will only
underwrite insurance policies

to be fraudulent.

41:06.373 --> 41:10.047
if we only ever underwrite
deniable claims,

41:10.883 --> 41:13.955
then you will never pay out

42:43.635 --> 42:44.904
anchored at London Bridge
as you instructed.

42:45.940 --> 42:47.910
And aboard, you got
to talking to the captain

42:47.910 --> 42:48.812
in the captain's cabin.

42:49.680 --> 42:50.615
Yes.

42:52.953 --> 42:54.189
It is a very interesting ship.

42:55.225 --> 42:58.631
It was built at Â£40 a ton.
She's 1,200 tons.

42:59.700 --> 43:01.671
Her ratio beam to length is
five and a half to one,

43:01.671 --> 43:03.207
which is the new
American dimension.

43:03.207 --> 43:05.378
Designed in Boston, and...

43:05.378 --> 43:07.348
Who the fuck discusses
beams and lengths?

43:08.284 --> 43:09.185
I do.

43:11.724 --> 43:12.659

43:13.528 --> 43:15.398

is my interest.

43:15.398 --> 43:16.366
Hmm.

43:19.707 --> 43:20.642
Well, it is.

43:26.854 --> 43:28.390
He took out some drawings
of the ship to show me.

43:30.996 --> 43:31.931
I was impressed.

43:34.402 --> 43:35.972
I asked after his destination.

43:38.010 --> 43:40.114
And then you asked about
the cargo as I told you to.

43:44.055 --> 43:45.391
Wedgwood porcelain,

43:45.793 --> 43:47.830
silks of beams

43:50.869 --> 43:52.238
and three quarters of a ton
of illicit gunpowder.

43:57.282 --> 43:58.350
The captain
told you this himself?

44:00.822 --> 44:02.960
Picture the scene, Mr. Drummle.

44:04.162 --> 44:07.101
Pip sat there
on the couch, sweetly.

44:07.970 --> 44:09.840
The captain wanting
to play the rogue.

44:13.213 --> 44:15.117
He said if I didn't believe him,
he would show me below.

44:17.790 --> 44:18.725
Go on, Pip.

44:22.065 --> 44:23.367
I went below
and saw the powder for myself.

44:25.839 --> 44:26.741
And then...

44:30.047 --> 44:31.383
He led me to the shadows

44:31.952 --> 44:33.321
and asked if I wanted
to sail with him

44:33.321 --> 44:34.255
and share his quarters.

44:35.458 --> 44:36.861
Just as far as Liverpool.

44:37.830 --> 44:39.432
He said he would pay
for my passage back to London.

44:44.109 --> 44:45.077
He tried to hold me.

44:46.113 --> 44:47.014
Luckily, I'm strong.

44:48.852 --> 44:50.187
I went back onto the deck
and rowed to shore.

44:51.189 --> 44:53.427
With your valuable knowledge
secure in your head.

44:54.530 --> 44:55.431
You see, Drummle,

44:56.267 --> 44:58.471
when Pip was first put
into my charge,

44:58.471 --> 44:59.773
I wondered to myself,

45:00.441 --> 45:03.280
"How can a man like me
make use of such innocence?"

45:03.782 --> 45:06.921
But make use of it
you surely have.

45:06.921 --> 45:09.058
MR. JAGGERS: The boy
will hear many things.

45:09.593 --> 45:11.263
Because who among us
does not want

45:11.263 --> 45:13.433
to impress the impressionable?

45:14.068 --> 45:16.039
A captain running gunpowder
to New York?

45:17.375 --> 45:18.243
He would hang.

45:19.179 --> 45:21.249
But blackmail...

45:22.418 --> 45:25.792
It is too crude for gentlemen
such as us, Mr. Drummle.

45:27.997 --> 45:29.934
The letter I had Pip
deliver to the captain

45:29.934 --> 45:32.339
was a recommendation that he
should have his ship insured

45:32.339 --> 45:33.942
for the journey to Liverpool
and New York

45:33.942 --> 45:35.477

45:36.246 --> 45:37.281

45:37.281 --> 45:40.823

45:40.823 --> 45:42.560
can never be claimed against.

45:42.560 --> 45:44.262

a rat in the river.

45:45.866 --> 45:47.001
And should the claim
ever come to court,

45:47.402 --> 45:49.106
Pip would be our witness

45:49.106 --> 45:51.510
that the ship was carrying
a dangerous and illegal cargo,

45:52.244 --> 45:54.550
which he saw
with his own two eyes.

45:54.550 --> 45:56.219
Innocent as an oyster knife.

46:00.963 --> 46:02.064

46:04.169 --> 46:06.106
that if our
relationship prospers,

46:06.575 --> 46:08.177
you will make
more money from this

46:08.177 --> 46:10.815
than you ever did
from the importation of nutmeg.

46:42.546 --> 46:44.817

of his fortune from it.

46:46.219 --> 46:47.556
And let me guess,
he's soon to be married?

46:48.658 --> 46:50.094

46:53.200 --> 46:54.135
Mr. Jaggers.

46:55.605 --> 46:57.342

introduced me to the man

the woman I love.

47:02.118 --> 47:03.921

that you are evil

47:07.162 --> 47:09.132

what is your reason?

then Â£100,000.

48:35.739 --> 48:37.175
We will use my money?

48:37.175 --> 48:39.111
We are not using your money.

48:39.747 --> 48:41.149
We are investing it.

48:42.619 --> 48:44.723
For surety, I will match it
from my own pocket.

Put the pieces in the bucket.

49:30.414 --> 49:33.688
When you have Â£100,000,

49:35.190 --> 49:37.362
then, perhaps your desire
to be a gentleman

49:37.362 --> 49:38.363
will be fulfilled.

49:39.700 --> 49:41.469
And once you are a gentleman,

49:42.204 --> 49:45.545
the whole almighty
British Empire

49:45.545 --> 49:49.218
will be spread before your feet
like the skin of a tiger.

Of course, you know
that I have another desire.

49:57.769 --> 49:58.772
Estella.

49:58.772 --> 49:59.773
Yes.

50:02.278 --> 50:05.050
And if you help ruin
Drummle's business,

50:05.719 --> 50:08.189
Estella might be freed
from her affiancement.

50:12.365 --> 50:14.168
So, you are giving me
two motivations.

50:15.672 --> 50:16.707
Avarice...

50:17.843 --> 50:19.078
and love.

50:20.247 --> 50:21.717
Two fine horses
to pull a heavy carriage.

50:27.328 --> 50:29.099
It was I who
recommended Drummle

50:29.099 --> 50:30.368
to Miss Havisham

50:30.368 --> 50:32.105
as Estella's future husband,

50:32.105 --> 50:34.308
so that he might serve
this very purpose.

50:41.423 --> 50:44.428
You spend a great deal of time
on your strategies.

50:46.600 --> 50:47.669

50:52.244 --> 50:53.346
Will you join me, Pip?

50:55.552 --> 50:56.620

of avarice and love,

51:00.662 --> 51:02.632
no matter what crime you commit,

51:03.801 --> 51:05.838
I am the best lawyer in London.

51:07.475 --> 51:11.517
And I will always find a way
to have all charges dropped.

51:15.658 --> 51:17.161
Put the champagne on ice, Pip.

51:27.649 --> 51:29.151
Now, pick up your glass.

51:31.590 --> 51:32.525
Come on.

51:41.711 --> 51:45.384
To liberty, love and money.

is very well-connected

with the finest ladies
in Wapping.

52:11.837 --> 52:13.942
If you accompany him upstairs,

52:13.942 --> 52:15.377
you will get to meet
some of them.

Estella.

She's coming to London.

When?

Uh, the letter didn't say.
But she's coming.

has found her a suitor.
