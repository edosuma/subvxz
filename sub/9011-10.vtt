from the government,

That way, if someone has a gun

09:21.811 --> 09:23.646
and we both tell you to shoot
the other one

09:23.730 --> 09:26.190
because they're the evil one,
you'll know who's lying.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.108
Hey, check it out.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.694
Damn it!

09:31.821 --> 09:33.530
Hey, you didn't pay your bill!

09:33.615 --> 09:35.991
T-The red "X"! Red "X"!

09:36.076 --> 09:37.993
RICK: Hey, it's a good thing
that space outlet had lab coats

09:38.078 --> 09:39.912
and your favorite kind of shirt
in stock, huh, Morty?

09:39.996 --> 09:41.789
Yeah, Rick, l-I heard
you the first time.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.624
You don't have to keep saying it
over and over.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.292
Man, this place is way
off the grid.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.086
This guy does not want
to be found.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.214
Well, if he's a Rick, doesn't he just
have to stand by a Morty to hide?

09:50.298 --> 09:53.050
I mean, isn't that what Mortys are...
human cloaking devices?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.970
Morty, you're making a bigger
deal out of this than it is.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.054
[ groaning in distance ]

09:57.138 --> 09:58.847
Oh, my god, Rick, look!

09:58.932 --> 10:01.684
There's a bunch of people
strapped all over that building!

10:01.768 --> 10:04.728
Not people, Morty...
Mortys.

10:04.813 --> 10:10.025
[ all groaning, screaming ]

10:10.110 --> 10:12.194
Oh, god!

10:12.279 --> 10:14.071
W-Why would somebody do this?
It's horrible!

10:14.155 --> 10:16.323
Well, one Morty's enough to hide
from the bureaucrats,

10:16.408 --> 10:18.325
but you get... you get
a whole matrix of Mortys

10:18.410 --> 10:20.077
and put them in agonizing pain,

10:20.161 --> 10:23.247
that creates a pattern that can hide
even from other Ricks, motherfucker.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.333
I fiddled with a concept
like this once.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.961
On paper, Morty.
On paper.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.796
I wouldn't do this.
It's barbaric overkill.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.840
I mean, you could accomplish
the same result with, like,

10:32.924 --> 10:35.342
five Mortys and a jumper cable.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.095
Which I also wouldn't do!

10:38.179 --> 10:40.931
I'm just saying, it's bad
craftsmanship.

10:41.016 --> 10:43.350
BETH: Coffee time!
RICKS: Yo, yo, yo, yo!

10:43.435 --> 10:46.228
That's what I like to hear!

- [ groans ]
- Hi, Jerry.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.940
Leave me alone.
I'm working.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.900
Oh, you are?
W-W-W-What do you do?

10:51.985 --> 10:55.029
[ scoffs ] I-I'm... I'm in between
advertising jobs.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.989

10:57.073 --> 10:59.199
So, people need help figuring
out what to buy,

10:59.284 --> 11:00.659
and then y-y-you help 'em?

11:00.744 --> 11:03.245
[ laughing ] Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.539
Well, I mean, you do it,
and you seem like a guy

11:05.623 --> 11:07.333
who really has it all together.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.504
Dude, are you... w...
you're being a dick, right?

11:12.589 --> 11:13.964
Oh, gosh, l-I hope not.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.508
I-I-I-l-I-l wouldn't want to
offend you in any way.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.469
You're really a Rick?

11:18.553 --> 11:20.554
[ laughs ]
Y... of course I am...

11:20.638 --> 11:22.514
just as much
as my Morty's a Morty.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.391
Hey, he looks a lot
like Eric Stoltz

11:24.476 --> 11:26.393
from the movie "Mask."

11:26.478 --> 11:28.187
You know, the one
with Cher in it?

11:28.271 --> 11:29.271
That's right, Jerry!

11:29.356 --> 11:31.273
He... he's from a reality
where everyone is

11:31.358 --> 11:32.983
Eric Stoltz "Mask" people.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.360
He's Eric Stoltz Mask Morty.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.819
They assigned him to me

11:35.904 --> 11:37.738
because I never had
any kids of my own.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.198
But if I did, boy, I'd love them

11:39.282 --> 11:40.991
if they were as smart
and as successful

11:41.076 --> 11:42.159
as you are, Jerry.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.744
Hey, get a load of this.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.746
Jerry's hanging out
with doofus Rick.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.164
[ laughs ] This is perfect.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.749
I'm not doofus Rick!

11:48.833 --> 11:50.042
I'm Rick J19-Zeta-7!

11:50.126 --> 11:52.461
Oh, is that the timeline
where everybody eats poop?

11:52.545 --> 11:54.505
Jerry, you know this guy
eats poop, right?

11:54.589 --> 11:56.215
Hey, I don't eat poop!

11:56.299 --> 11:58.300
Y-You guys are always
so mean to me.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.886
- [ both laugh ]
- [ sobbing ]

12:00.970 --> 12:03.222
I guess it's only fair
to tell you now, Jerry.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.140
I'm the worst Rick of them all.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.184
According to who...
other versions of you?

12:07.268 --> 12:08.560
If I've learned one thing,

12:08.645 --> 12:10.354
it's that before you get
anywhere in life,

12:10.438 --> 12:12.398
you got to stop listening
to yourself.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.233
Wow.
You really are wise, Jerry.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.194
I-I-I guess that's why you work
in advertising.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.196
The fact that you feel that way

12:19.280 --> 12:21.198
makes you the best Rick
of them all.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.200
You don't care about me at all!

12:23.284 --> 12:25.164
I'm no different than that
jacket you've got on!

12:25.245 --> 12:27.204
Y-Y-Y... o-or your stupid
portal gun!

12:27.288 --> 12:29.665
I'm just a tool!
I-I-I'm just an object!

12:29.749 --> 12:31.542
Hey, it's your choice
to take it personally, Morty.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.293
Now, for the love of god,
be quiet.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.258
The point of this is to get
the drop on the guy.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.922
You know what, Rick?
I'll tell you something!

12:37.006 --> 12:39.591
I'm more than a human shield!
- Yeah, that's right. You are.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.344
You're a perfect, impenetrable
suit of human armor, Morty,

12:42.429 --> 12:44.304
because you're as dumb
as I am smart,

12:44.389 --> 12:46.056
which is why when I say
[burps] "shut up,"

12:46.141 --> 12:48.100
it's really good advice.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.018

Ooh. Look at you, C-137.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.704
You... aren't you
a tough customer?

13:08.788 --> 13:11.540
The slow clap? Really?
Kind of played out, dude.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.375
Not in this dimension, it isn't.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.085
In fact [chuckles]
I invented it.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.254
Nobody else has ever even
done it here before.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.338
Well, la-Di-DA.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.715
Hey, that's mine!

13:23.636 --> 13:25.276
I don't like the look
of that Rick, Morty.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.598
- We gotta escape.
- I'm not gonna help you, Rick.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.224
Y-You're a monster.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.101
Don't be rick-diculous,
Morty.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.895
Will you stop saying that?
It's stupid.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.396
Take his Morty away.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.607
- Come with me.
- Yeah, gladly.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.984
Geez, man. Ricks, huh?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.986
Hey, man, you seem to know
how this place works.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.197
Is there any way we could
shut down that grid

13:43.281 --> 13:44.865
and rescue all those
Mortys outside?

13:44.949 --> 13:46.074
It would be pointless.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.244
Mortys have no chance
of defeating a Rick.

He's not laughing at your
dumb jokes, Rick.

as clever as you think you are.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.743
I wanted you to find me.

We're not so [burps] different,
you and I.

- Yeah, duh!
- See this right here, Rick?

14:34.249 --> 14:36.208
I crunched the numbers.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.377
I created a spectrum
of all the Ricks.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.213
I listed them out
from most evil to least evil.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.965
Here's where I am.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.050
And look it... right here's
where you are, Rick.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.553
This guy right here...
super-weird.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.304
I get it. So you want me
to team up with you to take down

14:49.389 --> 14:51.473
The Council of Ricks?
Is that where you're going with this?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.016
'Cause that's where I'd be going.

Please. I think I'm doing
pretty good on my own.

I'm simply gonna download
the contents of your brain

14:58.398 --> 15:01.567
and then kill you.

Okay, if we add a little more
titanium nitrate

the George Washingtons should be.

gonna tell you

that these will
increase in value

or even hold their current value.

The truth is, you bought them
because you like them.

That's what matters.

just gonna give up?

18:14.260 --> 18:16.136
I mean, you...
you look just like Rick.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.722
We could maybe, you know,
get rid of him.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.557
I'm not saying kill him,
necessarily.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.393
I... I'm also not saying
necessarily not kill him, but...

18:23.478 --> 18:26.146
Jerry, w-we both know
it wouldn't work.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.232
It's time to go back
to our lives.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.318
I love you, Jerry.
I love you.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.403
[ sighs ]

18:39.869 --> 18:42.120
[ whimpers ]

18:47.502 --> 18:49.085
TOGETHER:
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

18:49.170 --> 18:50.962
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!
Hut! Hut! Hut!

18:53.883 --> 18:56.343
W-What... w-what's gonna
happen to all these Mortys?

18:56.427 --> 18:58.428
They'll go back to their
families,

18:58.513 --> 19:02.599
attend school regularly,
play video games, date girls.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.936
Poor little Rickless bastards.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.063
COUNCILMAN RICK:
Earth Rick C-137,

19:08.147 --> 19:11.233
the council apologizes
for its false accusation,

19:11.317 --> 19:13.819
and in the way of reparations
[burps] for our terrible mistake,

19:13.903 --> 19:17.197
we would like to compensate you
with this voucher

19:17.281 --> 19:19.741
for a free replacement Morty
in the event

19:19.826 --> 19:21.868
that y[burps]our current
[burps] Morty should...

19:21.953 --> 19:24.246
Uh, guys, not a good time.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.206
Come on, Morty. Let's hit it.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.293
MORTY:
ls it time for arcs yet, Rick?

19:30.378 --> 19:31.753
I did a pretty good job
back there

19:31.838 --> 19:33.922
for a human cloaking device.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.366
Saved your ass.
- All right, Morty.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.133
Don't break an arm jerking
yourself off.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.885
Man, I can't believe you, Rick.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.887
That right there, that w...
that was a great opportunity

19:40.972 --> 19:42.889
to show a little humanity,
you know?

19:42.974 --> 19:44.474
To connect with me a little.

19:44.559 --> 19:45.934
Hey, Morty, you want connection,

19:46.018 --> 19:48.478
go be part of some stupid club,
like all those dumb Ricks.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.981
You know, maybe I don't connect
because I'm the Rickest Rick.

19:51.065 --> 19:53.358
And, you know, it would g...
[burps]

19:53.442 --> 19:55.610
go without saying
that the Rickest Rick

19:55.695 --> 19:57.070
would have the Mortyest Morty.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.364
- It would go without saying, huh?
- Yeah, it would.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.200
Did you hear me say it?
- Nah.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.202
The Mortyest Morty.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.496
Just don't get too big
for your loafers, Buster Brown.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.748
A cocky Morty can lead to some
big problems.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.709
It can be a real bad thing
for everybody.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.377
Oh, yeah? How's that?

20:12.461 --> 20:15.380
U-Uh, I'll explain when
you're older.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.673
[ camera shutter clicks ]

20:16.757 --> 20:17.924
What a mess.

20:18.009 --> 20:19.885
Pride cometh before the fall.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.803
I guess he got what he deserved.

20:21.888 --> 20:22.679
What is that?

20:22.763 --> 20:23.847
[ electricity crackles ]

20:23.931 --> 20:25.515
Hand me the laser difibulator.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.225
Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help?

20:27.310 --> 20:28.602
No! Go clean the toilets.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.520
Maybe you'll make friends
with some turds.

20:30.605 --> 20:33.023
You make us ashamed to be
ourselves!

20:34.483 --> 20:37.152
My god. I've seen
this technology before.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.528
[ device beeping ]

20:38.613 --> 20:40.530
This Rick was being
controlled remotely...

20:40.615 --> 20:42.115
puppeteered by somebody else.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.911
This is the receiver.
- Yeah, but where's the transmitter?

20:45.995 --> 20:48.246
[ beeping continues ]

21:34.877 --> 21:37.253
Wubba dubba dub dub!
Oh. Hey, Jerry.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.589
W-W-W-What are you doing
in my room, buddy?

21:39.674 --> 21:41.758
Nothing.
I was just, um...

21:41.842 --> 21:43.760
[sniffles] checking
the smoke detectors.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.763
All right.
Okay, get out.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.036
What's that dipshit doing
out there?

22:10.121 --> 22:11.246
Are you friends with him?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.123
You know he eats his own shit,
right?

22:13.207 --> 22:15.041
[ laughing ]
Oh, my god, this is rich!

22:15.126 --> 22:18.044
I've got like [burps] 10 Ricks
to call right now.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.006
Did you get any of that?

22:21.090 --> 22:23.049
It's a good-a show!
