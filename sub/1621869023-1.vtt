WEBVTT

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
-So I guess this is it.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
-Yeah.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
I guess so.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
-Well, do you guys have to go
to the new house right away

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
or do you have some time?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
-We got some time.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
-Okay, should we
get some coffee?

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
-Sure.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Where?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Wow.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Wow.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I mean, this is beautiful.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
It's beautiful.
Look at that.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Oh, man.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
So many -- So many different
episodes are like

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
you know,
Lisa playing guitar up there,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Jen and I, our first kiss,

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
like, the pilot,
opening the umbrella.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
I mean, come on.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Where is everyone?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Come on, I want to see everyone.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
-Oh, my God.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Oh!

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
-That "Oh!"

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
-This is all I care about.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
-Hi. Hi.
-Hi.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
-Oh, my God.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Hello.
Oh, you smell good, too.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
-Yeah, so do you.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Look at that.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
-Wasn't there a decision
to lose this?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
-Yes, I thought this was gone.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
This was here in the beginning,
and --

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
-It kept, like --
-Got in the way.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
-It got in the way. Yeah.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
-Sorry, you got lost
behind the beam.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
-As it's probably
getting in the way now.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
-Well, I don't know.
-Oh.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
-Sometimes it's a choice.
-There we go.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Ee, ee, ee.
-How crazy is this?

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
-I hear someone.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
-I just started crying.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
-Floosh!

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
-Joo!

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
-It's amazing.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Hi.
-How are you?

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
-Ooh. Holy crap.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Oh, weird.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Alright, well,
where's the tissue box?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
-Uh-oh.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
-Oh!
- Hey!

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
What are you guys doing here?

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
-Waiting for you.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
-Oh, my God.
How are you?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Oh, look at you.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Look at you.
-Hello. Big blue.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
-This is great.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
-This is too weird.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
-Look at this.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
-Remember when we all used
to fit through that door?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Oh.
-I got chills.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
-It's so weird.
Walk that way, buddy.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
-Look at this.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Does Courteney still have her
lines written on the table?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
-Do you know what
the difference is?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
You know what's nuts?
Oh, really?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
-I never knew she did that.
And I saw it.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I was like, "What is this?"
She goes --

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
"Mind your business," she said.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
So before we shot that night,
I erased it all.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
-No.
-And she got so mad at me.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Or had the script
in the sink.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
-That I do remember.
-That I remember.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
-There was always
a script in the sink.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I didn't know why.
-That was Courteney's script.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
-Good for her.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Oh, my God.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
-Really?
-C.C.!

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
-Did you cry too?
-Yes.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
-Okay, good.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
-Of course I did.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
-How are you? Ohh.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
-Wow.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
-I know.
It's worse than you imagine.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
-Look at you.
-Oh, you do smell good, Court.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
-Hi.
-Oh, my gosh. That's crazy.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
-Do you remember that night?
-What?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
-You had -- I don't remember
what episode it was.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
But you had this, like,
big speech,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
and you were struggling
with it all week long,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
and you wrote it on the table,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
and then just -- and I didn't
know that that's what you did.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
And I saw it and I asked you,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
and you told me
to mind my business.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
So when you weren't looking,
I erased it before we shot.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
-That's so mean.
-And you got so mad at me.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
-I didn't know you did that.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
-Why would you erase it?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
-Just to get you.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
-God, I had so many --

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
so much of my dialogue
within these apples.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
-I didn't know.
-Oh, sometimes, yeah.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I have memory issues.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
-Matthew Perry's here.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
-Hello.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
-Hey, Matt.
-Matty!

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
-Looshy. Hi.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
-Could you  be  any later?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
-Hey.
-How are you, brother?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
-Hey.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
-How are you, bud?
-Good.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
-Look at all of us.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Oh, my God.
-This is crazy.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
-Does it seem smaller
to anyone else?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
From here to over there.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
-Does not feel smaller.
-No.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
-It feels the same to me.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
-And was it always purple,
that wall?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
-Yes.
-Oh, my God.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
-Yeah, you've gone crazy.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
-I mean, this is incredible.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
-Yeah, it really is.
The whole thing.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
-Just really...

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
-Oh, the one thing missing --

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
the original cookie jar
is at Lisa Kudrow's house.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
-Did you take anything
from the set besides --

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I took a neon coffee mug.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
-I have the original ball
from the foosball table.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
You look at it and go,
"What is that old, crappy --"

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
-Should have taken
the whole table.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
-We smashed it, remember?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
By the end, it got smashed.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
-Oh, it did?
-Then what's that?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
-Well, that was before
it got destroyed.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
We're going back
a little further.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
-I need to watch this series.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
-It was good.
-I have the original ball.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
-Yeah, yeah.
-It had its moments.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
-That's what I hear.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
So no one told you
life was gonna be this way

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
you're broke

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
in second gear

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
your week, your month

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
When the rain
starts to pour

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
'Cause you're there
for me too

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
-Save it. Thank you.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
You're very, very kind.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
Okay, thank you so much for
coming out to be here tonight.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Let's be honest,
none of you had other plans.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
-Have fun, pal.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
-Okay, here we go.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
We excited?
-We got this in the bag.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
-This is gonna be fun.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
-...together on a stage
for the first time in years.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Jennifer Aniston,

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Courteney Cox,
Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer,

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc,
the cast of "Friends"!

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
So no one told you
life was gonna be this way

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
you're broke

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
in second gear

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
your week, your month

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
'Cause you're there
for me too

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
-The cast of "Friends,"
everybody.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Might need to squeeze up there.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Take a seat.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Look at this.
Look at all of you.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
-Hello.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
-Hello, James Corden.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
-I cannot tell you
how incredible it is

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
to be here with all of you now.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And we are -- I should say
we are shooting now

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
in front of the iconic fountain

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
where you shot
the opening credits.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It's beautiful and it's lovely.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
It is, however, noisy...

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
-Yes.
-...and difficult --

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
difficult to conduct
an interview.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
So if you'll just wait,
watch this.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Watch this for power.
Wait there.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Done. Okay.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
-That's superpowers.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
-Alright. I know. I know.
-Those are superpowers.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
-You still got it.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
-I know.
-Had we known

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
all those years ago.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
-Now, how are we doing?

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
This has been an emotional day
for all of you.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
How are you feeling
to be together,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
the six of you right now?

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
-It's been so fantastic
and exciting.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
And we've literally just
sort of slipped right back

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
right -- as we usually do.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
-David, how have you
found this time?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
-Really emotional.
Really, really fun, actually.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I felt, after the initial shock

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
of just being
in the same room together,

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
just I think we all just fell
right into our same old --

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
our same old kind of joking
around like we're a family.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
And so it really was --
-Regressed. We regressed.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
-We regressed, yeah.
-Back to 20s.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
-How much do you
stay in touch?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
-Yeah, no,
we stay in touch for sure.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Maybe not every day.
-Sure.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
-But, you know,
we have such a bond

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
from having done this show

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
and forged
this very tight relationship

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
that, you know,
any time you text

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
or call someone,
they're going to pick up.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
They'll be there.
-Matthew, who doesn't pick up?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
-I don't hear from anyone.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
-Now, I'm going to
give you some stats, okay?

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
So "Friends," you made
236 episodes of the show.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
It aired in
over 220 territories.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
"Friends" was TV's number-one
comedy for six straight seasons,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
averaging 25 million viewers
a week.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
52 million people
watched the finale.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
The show has been watched
over 100 billion times

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
across all platforms.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And tonight...
-That's a lot.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
-That's a lot.
-...is a real

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
celebration of that.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
And the creators of the show
are here tonight

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
sat in the audience.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
Marta Kauffman, David Crane,
Kevin Bright are just sat there.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
They created the show.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
-I'm the executive producer

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
and sometimes director
of "Friends."

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
My name is Kevin Bright.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
-I'm co-creator,
executive producer,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
and writer Marta Kauffman.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
-I'm the co-creator and
executive producer of "Friends."

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
I'm David Crane.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Marta and I spent our 20s
living in New York.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
We had a tight
circle of friends.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
-There we were in our 20s
in New York

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
trying to make a living
and find love.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
-And we thought
that could be a show.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
-We drew on relatives of ours
and friends of ours

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
and names were --

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
We named Chandler
after a friend of mine.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
I mean, we definitely
pulled from our lives.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
-We really were intrigued
with the idea

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
of doing a true ensemble.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
It's not like there's a lead
and they have friends.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
No, it's just about the friends.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
We're following
all of their stories equally,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
which we felt like
we hadn't seen before.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
The one-sentence pitch is it's
about that time in your life

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
when your friends
are your family.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
-Want to see this area?
-Yeah.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
I knew you were
gonna do it.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
-When did you knock?

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
-Only in the reunion.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Wow-ee.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
Oh, the beam is back.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
-Memories just flashed back

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
of, like, jokes coming out
of the bathroom.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
-I know, the bathroom.
-"Oh, do not --"

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
Just, like, stupid things
that you would do.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
-Oh.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
-Did you go next door?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
-I have not.
-Come on.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
-What's back here?

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
-Look at the chairs.
The chairs are here.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Ohh, yeah, oh, yeah.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
-These I think can be operated
by just one person.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
But back then,
we had three per camera.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It was a huge crew.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Four cameras, like,
the choreography was incredible.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
-Ohhh.
-Ohhh.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
-Ohh. Ohh.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Do you remember
the episode where

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
we never got out of the chairs?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
-Yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
-Pizza's on the way.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
I told you
we wouldn't have to get up.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
-But you remember the beginning
of the week

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
after the table draft,
you came to me and you go,

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
"It's so stupid."

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I was like, "Yeah,
but that's the brilliance."

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
And you were like, "Maybe
we can have fun with this."

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
And then we had a blast.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
-What if we have to pee?

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
-I'll cancel the sodas.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
-Oh, they're sitting
in their chairs.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
-No, they aren't.
Are they really?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
-Oh, Matty,
it's good to see you, man.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
-This is great.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
-Schwimmer, the episode where
you guys were throwing a ball

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
and the whole time,
you couldn't drop the ball.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
-I don't remember that.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
-Let me ask the boys.
-What kind of ball?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
-It was like a Nerf ball.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
Hey, guys.
Hey, do you remember the one

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
where you guys were throwing
a ball back and forth

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
and you couldn't drop the ball?
-Couldn't drop the ball, yeah.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
-Yes.
-So it was you two.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
-Everybody ended up
getting in on it.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Schwimmer was in on it.
-No memory.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
-You want to
get something to eat?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Or you want to see how long

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
we can throw this ball
back and forth?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
-The ball thing.
-Yeah?

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
-This is how old we are.
This is what laptops were.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
-No, I remember that.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
-It's so heavy.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
-Let's go look at
the dressing rooms.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
-This is Jennifer's forever.
-My room.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Those are my hardwood floors.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
-You guys ate lunch
together every day.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
-Yeah, we did.
-First couple of years,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
like, we ate
every meal together.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
-That's right.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
-Even on the weekend.
-We watched every show together.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
-We were inseparable, all of us.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
-Big center table here,
and Enger would cook --

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
-It all seems small to me,
the whole stage.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
-No, that's impossible, though,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
because we haven't grown.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
-Well, speak for yourself.
-Shut up.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
-Let's talk about
favorite episodes.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Everybody's got
their favorite episodes.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I'm keen to know what are yours.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
-I love the Thanksgiving ones,
but I also -- I loved

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
when we traded --
when we lost the apartment.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
The quiz, the embryos.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
-Yeah, the one with the embryos.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
-Yeah, but that quiz was really
fun and really devastating.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
-Yeah.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
-I just can't believe
that you think

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
that you and Chandler
know me and Rachel better

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
than we know you.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
-Well, we do.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
-What is Monica's
biggest pet peeve?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
-Animals dressed as humans.
-That's correct.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
-What name appears
on the address label?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
-It's Chandler Bing!
-No!

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
-Actually,
it's "Miss Chanandler Bond."

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
-If we win, they have to get rid
of the rooster.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
-Ooh, that's interesting.
-But if we win...

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
we get your apartment.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
-What is Chandler Bing's job?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
-Oh, oh, he's a transponds--
transponster!

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
-That's not even a word!

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
No!
-Oh, my God.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
-Yes!
-Whoo!

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
-Okay, the test is ready.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Each team will answer
a set of trivia questions, okay?

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
The categories are
"Fears and Pet Peeves,"

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
"Ancient History"...
-Oh, no!

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
-..."Literature"...
-Uh-oh.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
-...and "It's All Relative."
-Okay.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
-Now the coin toss
to see who goes first.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
-Okay.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
-Okay, somebody call it
this time.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
-Oh, sorry.
-Okay, here we go.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
-Okay.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Heads.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
-Oh, it's tails,
and the boys go first.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
-Alright. Okay.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
-Okay, here we go.
Pick your category.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
-Ancient History.
-Alright.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
"Rachel wrote Ross a letter
and demanded he read it

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
before they got back together.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
How many pages was that letter?"

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
-18 pages.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
-Damn.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
-18 pages...
-Front and back!

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
-Front and back is correct.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
-Oh, my God, that's good.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
-This is the letter.
-Is that the letter?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
-This is the letter.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
-Who gets the points for that?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
-What?
-Me.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
-Okay, ladies, pick a category.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
-It's All Relative.
-It's All Relative.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
-Alright.
-Yes.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
-"Ladies, can you name
this voice?"

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
-That's my monkey.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
-Oh! Mr. -- Mr. Henkel.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
-Mr. Winkel -- Hinkel?
-Hinkel.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
-Wait. No, no, no. Really?
-No? What's his name?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
-Wait, wait.
Do it one more time.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
-Can we hear it again?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
-We know it. We know it.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
-No, wait, "That's my monkey."

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
It's the guy who lives
downstairs.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
-And his name would be...?
-Mr. Rickles.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
-No.
-I know it. I know it.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
-I know it!

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
-It's not your turn!

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
-No, will, the mystery voice
please reveal himself?

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
It's Larry Hankin
back as Mr. Heckles.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
-Heckles!

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
-I said Larry Hankin.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
-You all owe me a cat
and a waffle.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
-Larry Hankin, everyone.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
-But why didn't I get points
for getting the name right?!

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
-Alright, okay, guys,
you're up.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
-Literature.
-Literature.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
-Oh, that's a good choice,
gentlemen.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
-Thank you.
-Literature.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
"According to Monica,
how many erogenous zones

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
are there on the female body?"
-Seven.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
-Courteney, Courteney,
is that correct?

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
-That's correct. Seven.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
-Alright, ladies.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
-Ancient History.
-Ancient History.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
-Oh, you know what?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
I'm -- I'm gonna need
a little help

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
with this question.
-Oh, dear.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
-Gentlemen.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
-Oh.
-Oh!

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
-"This very barbershop quartet
famously delivered

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
a message to Rachel from Ross,

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
but can you
complete the lyrics?"

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
-One, two, three.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Congratulations on
your first week

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
before you're the boss

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
And you know who will
be there to support you

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
-Your something.
-Ross.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
-It's not Ross?
-Wait.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
-Is that --
Does that feel right?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Your one
and only boyfriend

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
-Gentlemen?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Dah-dah, dah-dah,
boyfriend Ross

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Dah-dah, dah-dah,
boyfriend Ro--

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Is that correct, gentlemen?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
-It's nice to have a boyfriend.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Your loyal, loving boyfriend,
Ross

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Ross.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Thanks, guys.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
-I think "Friends"
has this magic

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
because each character
is so distinct

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
that they could hold
a television show by themselves.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
-Yes?

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
-Hi. Is Rachel here?
I'm her sister.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
-When my agent
called me and said,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
"Do you want to play

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Rachel Green's sister
on 'Friends,'"

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
I was like,
"Have I won the lottery?"

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
-Which sister is this?

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
Is this the spoiled one
or the one that bit her?

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
-Daddy cut me off.
-Never mind. I got it.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
-Okay, so one of the most
exciting things was I got

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
to be in this scene
where I'm in the apartment

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
and Joey walks in and he goes...

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
-Hey, how you doin'?

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
-Don't.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
-And it was his iconic line
and I was so excited.

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
And to watch a famous character
say his famous line, come on.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
-Hey, it's Phoebe.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
We can talk to Phoebe.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
-If you think about Monica
or Phoebe or Rachel,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
each one of them
is a leading character.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
But together, you get this great
repartee, all the actors

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
at the top of their game,
and great chemistry.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
-Alright.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
-No!
Joey, we swore we'd never tell.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
-They'll never understand.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
-We have to say something.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
We have to get it out.
It's eating me alive.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
-They were funny,
they were engaging,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
they knew
their characters so well,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
but they also worked
so well together.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
There was a real sense
of love for each other.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
-Monica...
-Bigger, louder.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
-...got stung by a jellyfish.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
-Alright.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
I got stung.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Stung bad.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
I couldn't stand.
I couldn't -- I couldn't walk.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
-We were two miles
from the house.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
We were scared and alone.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
We didn't think
we could make it.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
-I was in too much pain.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
-And I was tired from digging
the huge hole.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
-And then Joey
remembered something.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
-I'd seen this thing
on the Discovery Channel.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
-Wait a minute. I saw that
on the Discovery Channel.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
Yeah.
About jellyfish and how if y--

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Eww.
-Eww!

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
-You -- You peed on yourself?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
-Eww!

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
-You can't say that.
You don't know.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
I thought I was gonna
pass out from the pain.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Anyway, I-I tried,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
but I couldn't.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
I just couldn't bend that way,
so...

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
-Oh, Monica looks at Joey.
-Eww!

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
-That's right, I stepped up.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
-She's my friend
and she needed help.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
If I had to,
I'd pee on any one of you.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Only, uh, I couldn't.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
I got the stage fright.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I wanted to help,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
but there was just too much
pressure, so -- so I, uh --

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I turned to Chandler.
-

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
Joey kept screaming at me,
"Do it, do it, do it now."

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Sometimes late at night,
I can still hear the screaming.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
-That -- That's 'cause sometimes
I just do it through the wall

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
to freak you out.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
-And scene.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
-You know, I was laughing
in that scene.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Do you remember
the first table read ever?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
That's the first time
I laid eyes on any of you.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
-I don't remember how --
I remember what you wore.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
That's it.
-That's unbelievable.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
-I don't remember
what the boys wore.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I do remember what Courteney
and you wore.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
That's it.
-What did I wear?

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
-A white lacy hippie-ish blouse.
-Oh, I was trying to be Phoebe.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
-You were being Phoebe.
And jeans.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
And Courteney had
a pink babydoll tee

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
from Fred Segal
with a white trim.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
-Yeah, I just remember
that's when we all met

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
or I remember meeting everyone
the first time.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
-You don't remember
what I was wearing?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
-I don't remember what,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
but I do remember
you're the first person I saw.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
And I was like, "Oh, okay.
That's why I've been losing out

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
on all of these roles
over these years.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I mean, this is the good--
this is the hunk.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
You know, right here.
Of course he's Joey."

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
And then hearing all of you
for the first time,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
I -- that blew me away.
-That's what I remember.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
-I just thought everyone
was so perfectly cast.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
-Yeah. Yeah.
-That's what I remember.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
-Casting the show
was really hard,

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
much more so than
I think we expected it to be.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
-We saw approximately
a gazillion people.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
-There are so many
different scenarios

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
where it wasn't going to be
these six people.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
It would have been
such a different show.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
We had seen David
for another role

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
for a pilot
we'd done the year before.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
-His hangdog expression
stuck with us.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
So when we started doing Ross,
that was in our minds.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
-Try to get David.
David has quit television.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
He's had a miserable experience
doing another show.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
He's moved back to Chicago
to just do theater.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
And we had to beg him
and beseech him.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
And "We wrote this for you."

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
-I believe we sent him
gift baskets.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
-I have no recollection
of the gift basket.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I thought we just
sent him the script.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
We assured him that whatever
his past experience was,

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
this was going to be different,
we promise.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
And he -- he came on board.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Alright, we got one.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
We saw a bunch of women
who read Phoebe,

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
and it was nothing.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
And meanwhile, my husband,
Jeffrey, was writing

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
and producing on
"Mad About You," and he said,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
"Phoebe is right here
playing Ursula the waitress."

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
-Here you go.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Can I get you anything else?
-No, thanks. We're fine.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
-Okay, I'm just gonna go
get your check, then.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
-Got it right here.
-Great. Okay. Right.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
-You could see a lot of the
beginnings of Phoebe there,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
but on "Mad About You,"
she had more of an edge.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Phoebe was a much more
positive image.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
-Lisa was someone who came in
and nailed the audition.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
She not only did
everything we'd hoped,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
she elevated the material.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
-Lisa Kudrow was
the second one

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
to get cast in "Friends"
right after David.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
And that was at the beginning,
so we thought we were on a roll.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
And then came about
two and a half months

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
where we cast no one.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
-Matt LeBlanc,
if I remember correctly,

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
had like $11 in his pocket
when he auditioned.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
Maybe it was $9,
but it wasn't a lot.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
-We saw a lot of guys
who you believed were actors,

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
guys who liked women,
but they weren't funny.

28:37.000 --> 28:43.000
Then Matt came in and suddenly
on him, the lines felt funny.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
-He hadn't done an awful lot.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
He'd done another show,
but he hadn't done an awful lot.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
-So Matt went right down
to the wire,

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
auditioned at the network,
at NBC with another actor,

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
and he killed it,
and he got the part as Joey.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
But the funny thing about it is

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
the other actor ended up
in the show

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
in "The One With the Unagi,"

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
playing Fake Joey, ironically.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
-How are you  doing?

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
-No, no, no, no, no.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
How  you  doin'?

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
How  you  doin'? Damn it, Carl.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
Go wait in the hall.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
-What do you remember
about the audition process?

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
-I remember I had gone in
a bunch of times,

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
and I think it was
on the final callback.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
I had gone -- I had gone with
a friend of mine to run lines

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
and he said, you know,

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
"So the show's about friends
and being friends

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
with, you know,
just a group of friends?"

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
I was like, "Yeah, kind of."

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
He goes, "Then we should
go out drinking."

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
And I was like, "Yeah,
that's a good idea."

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
So to make a long story short,

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I woke up in the middle
of the night at his apartment

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
and had to go to the bathroom,
and I got up too fast.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
And I can't believe
I'm telling this,

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
but I kind of blacked out,
as you do,

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
and fell face first
into the toilet.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
And I hit my nose
on the bottom of the toilet seat

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
and a huge, like, chunk of meat
came off my nose.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
And I'm looking in the mirror
and it's bleeding.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
I was like, "Oh, my God."

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
So I have to go in
for the big callback.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
And it's like a big,
ugly scab on my nose.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
And Marta Kauffman said,
"What happened to your face?"

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
And I told the truth
and got the job so...

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
-Look at that.
-Right? That's what happened.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
-And, David,
I know that at the time,

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
I think you were -- you were
doing a lot of theater.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
What was it about "Friends"
that attracted you to it?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
-Marta and David made it clear
to me, made it known to me

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
that they had written the role
of Ross with my voice in mind.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
And I was like,
"Well, I don't understand."

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
Ah, it's a bug. It's a bug.
-Oh, no!

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Is it gone?
-No, it's right there.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
Aah! Oh, that's fuzz.
That's fuzz.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
That's alright.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
-Was it real?

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
-Is it gone?
-It's gone, it's gone.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
-Can I just say --

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
-The important thing is
that we dealt with it well.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
-Yeah.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
You even reacted to that
like Phoebe.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
-That was great.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
That was much more
entertaining than my story.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
It really was.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
-We were having a tough time
finding Monica,

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
and we really saw Courteney
as kind of a Rachel at the time.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
-We met with Courteney Cox,
and she explained to us

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
why she didn't think
she was a Rachel

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
and that she herself
was more of a Monica.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
And she was right.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
Courteney brought this
incredible joy to the character.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
-She'd been in
the Bruce Springsteen video

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
and with Michael J. Fox
on "Family Ties."

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
So people knew Courteney.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
-Not enough so that it made it
the Courteney Cox show,

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
which was always the fear.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
We didn't want stars.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
But everything
Courteney brought to it

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
made Monica so much richer

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
than what we had
originally intended.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
I thought Chandler was gonna be
the easiest part to cast,

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
because he's not
just a character.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
He's got jokes. He's got,
like, actual real jokes.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
So I thought, "Here we go.
This is gonna be great."

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
And we saw actor after actor,
and it wasn't funny.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
-We had worked with
Matthew Perry on "Dream On."

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
And when Matthew reads
that dialogue, it sparkles

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
and it comes alive.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
And for the first time
through the casting process,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
we knew there was
a character there

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
and that this was
the only guy to play it.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
-There was just
a little problem.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
He had already signed on
for another sitcom.

33:01.000 --> 33:07.000
-It was about luggage handlers
in the future at LAX.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
It just sounded insane.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
-Enjoy Los Angeles.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
By the way, Griffith Park
has the best picnic areas.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
-Thank you.
You are most insignificant.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
-And then someone from
Warner Bros. actually was

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
at the taping of "2194"

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
and thought
"This show is never going.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
Put him in 'Friends.'
We'll be okay."

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
Suddenly it was like
"There's our Chandler."

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
-And I just won $1 million.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
-He spins the lines in a way
that they're his.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
And there's so many
comedy skills there.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
-Rachel was the hardest part
to cast,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
and it was
the last part we cast.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
-She could be a really
unlikable character.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
I mean, this is an incredibly
selfish, self-involved,

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
spoiled -- in the wrong hands,
you don't like Rachel.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
-We saw lots and lots
and lots of other women.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
-Women who come in wearing
actual wedding dresses

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
and none of it --

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
You didn't really fall in love,
and you needed to,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
'cause you needed to feel
what Ross was feeling.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
And then Jennifer came in.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
-Jennifer had a similar problem
to Matthew in that

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
she'd already signed on

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
to a show called
"Muddling Through."

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
-You gonna eat that steak
or argue with it?

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
-Madeline, this here steak
was supposed to be rare.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
-Gidney, tell me something.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
How often do we
have steak on the menu?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
-Shoot, hardly ever.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
-That's right.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
So what you have there
is a rare steak.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
-And they had already shot
six episodes of this show,

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
so it was a little bit more
than just the pilot.

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
-And we took this big risk
to cast her,

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
share her with this other show

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
and we'll see who wins.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
-And we even shot
not only the pilot,

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
but probably three
episodes of "Friends"

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
while that show
was still on television.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
And if it had --
if CBS had picked it up,

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
we would have had to reshoot

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
the first three episodes
of "Friends."

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
-Jennifer had this warmth
and sincerity

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
and genuineness about her,
where she just made you feel

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
okay about everything else
that Rachel was

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
that you might have
passed judgment on.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
-I was kind of hoping
that wouldn't be an issue.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Thank you.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
-Cut. Alright.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
-So, that's right.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
So, Matthew and Jen,
you were in another show.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I mean, Jen, what were
your first impressions

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
of the rest of the cast

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
when you finally got
to meet them,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
when it was made clear
that you could do the show?

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
-Well, first of all, I had
a graveyard of failed pilots.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
I did a pilot a year
and I thought,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
"That's what you do.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
You do a pilot a year
and you have some cash.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
And then you go on
to another pilot."

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
And I just remember sitting
with these five other people

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
and thinking,

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
"This is the greatest
group of people,

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
the greatest script.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
I have to do this."

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
And I actually,
tail between my legs,

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
hat in hand, went to the
producer of the show I was on

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
because they hired me
in second position,

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
and I said, "Please release me
from this show.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
I love this show
that I'm doing right now.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Nothing against your show.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
I just love these people
and I am having so much fun."

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
And he said -- he goes,
"I-I saw that show.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
I'm gonna tell you something.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
That show's not gonna
make you a star."

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
"This show is gonna
make you a star."

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
Enough said.
-Well, he's here tonight.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
That producer's here tonight.
-No!

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
-Okay, guys, you're up.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
-Okay, It's All Relative.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
-"While in Las Vegas,

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
Joey finds
his identical hand twin."

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
-Wouldn't you pay good money
to see these identical hands

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
showcased in some type
of a, uh, entertainment venue?

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
-If you leave now,
I will chop off my hand

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
and give it to you.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.000
-From this lineup...

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
please identify
Joey's hand twin.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
-2 or 3.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
-I think it's 2.
-You think it's 2?

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
-I think it's 2.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
-Right there, number 2.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
-Yes, that is correct.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
It's Thomas Lennon, everybody.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
-Great seeing you guys.
Great seeing you.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
-Great to see you.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
-Alright.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Alright, ladies, ladies,
you're up.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
-Fears. Fears and Pet Peeves.
-Fears and Pet Peeves.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
-Fears and Pet Peeves.
-Louder, Court.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
-"Ladies, there's a message
on the answering machine.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
Can you identify the voice?"

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
Matt, can you hit that button?

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
-"Hey, guys, I'm finally
retiring from ophthalmology

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
and would love for all of you

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
to come to my retirement party
next week."

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
-Tom -- Oh, sorry.
-Let me know if you can make it.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
-Tom Selleck.
-Tom Selleck.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
-Oh, my God.
I didn't say that. Wait.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
You looked so disappointed.
-Well, it's okay.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Will the mystery voice
please make himself known?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
-How could it not be?

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
-Look who it is.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
-Tom Selleck, everybody.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
-Hello.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
-Do you want to sit for a sec?

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
-How you doing?
-Good to see you, buddy.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
-Wow.
-Wow.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
-Alright, Tom,
you have a bonus question.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
-Alright.
-Oh, God. Okay.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
-Monica famously chose Chandler
over Richard.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
What did Chandler
do for a living?

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
-Oh, my God.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
-Just think this through.
Think it through.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
-I say transponster.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
-No, that's what
we lost the apartment over.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
-Oh, I thought we never
found out, though.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
-Transponster sounds good to me.
-Yes.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
-Transponster's not right.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
-That's what I said.
That's not even a word.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
And then we lost.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
-Right. Here's the answer.
And it's...

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
-Oh, Tom has it.
-Yeah.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Nobody knows, really.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
-That's the answer.
-That's what I just said.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
-Hey, that's the answer.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
-Yeah, that is the answer.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
-I think that should
go to the girls, then.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
-I do too.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
-They didn't have -- No, no, no.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
-Yeah, yeah,
we said nobody knows.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
-And the girls are the winners.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
-Obviously, the show came out

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
and immediately resonated
with people.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
When did you start to feel like
those changes

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
that you'd been told about
were starting --

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
the world
was starting to change?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
-The summer.
-It was -- Yeah.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
When we came back
for a second season,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
it was a completely
different ballgame.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
-I think people were starting
to say, "Hey,"

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
and you were not --
you were scared.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
And "What do you want?"
And at first, it's very jarring.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
No one really prepares you for
what that's going to be like.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
-I remember one time I was --
It was middle of the week,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I guess it was, I don't remember
what day of the week.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Doesn't matter.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
-It goes Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
-Yeah, that part I know.
But it was -- I was --

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
I happened to have the news on,
and on the TV,

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
they had the screen split
into six boxes.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
And it was an aerial shot,
live, of each of our houses.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
-Oh, geez.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
-And I remember looking at it
going "What the --"

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
and I could hear the helicopter
over my house.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I was like, "What the hell?"

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
And I'm looking close at the
screen, and my roof is a mess.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
So when the helicopter
flew away,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I got the ladder out
and went up on the roof

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
and sure as shit, I've got
some leaks up there.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
I had to call the roofer and
have them come over and fix it.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
-The fact is,
like, no one was going through

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
what we were going through
except the other five.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
So I think that was really --

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
-So there's no shoulders
outside of this group

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
to sort of go,
"Oh, this is so --"

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
And I think
it kind of created --

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
imprinted in
our neural pathways

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
this sort of, like,
we are actually family.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
-Yeah. Because our family
couldn't relate.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Our friends, our closest friends
couldn't relate.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
They were there for us, I think.
-Your family could--

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
My family was more starstruck
about it than we were.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
-But the only other people who
really knew what it was like

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
were the other five.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
-It seemed like
you weren't getting...

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
-We were doing a show,
and we were working really hard.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
But it wasn't until I was
walking through the airport --

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I don't remember
where I was going --

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
but they were on every magazine.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
And I was like, "Whoa.
Holy shit. This is crazy."

42:12.000 --> 42:17.000
-The theme song became a hit
on a radio station.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
And when I heard that
on my car one day,

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
that was like, "Wow, this is not
your average television show."

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
-They're on the cover
of  Rolling Stone.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
Rolling Stone.
I mean, we're a TV show.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
-They've somehow entered
the zeitgeist.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
I don't know when that happened.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
-Jennifer is gorgeous.
Why is it such a phenomenon?

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
It just suits her very well.
It's spectacular.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
-I think my favorite was
I was dropping my kids off,

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
and my rabbi stopped me and
asked me about Ross and Rachel

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
and when they were gonna
get together

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
and how that's gonna happen.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
-Wherever we were,

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
suddenly there are
thousands of people gathered.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
-It's like the Beatles
were there.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Everybody was screaming

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
and yelling
and behind barricades.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
It was crazy.
-Bye!

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
-Once "Friends" had gone global,

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
I think we were in
18 different languages.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
-Basically any place I went,

43:16.000 --> 43:22.000
you know, from Jordan to India,
they knew what "Friends" was.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
-My mom bought me the DVDs
of the whole series

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
when I was in elementary school.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
"Friends" really had a big hand
in teaching me English,

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
and the show
really taught me the things

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
about life and true friendship.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
-We love "Friends."

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
-Ohh.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
-Could I be wearing
any more clothes?

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
-My eyes! My eyes!

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
-Pervert! Pervert!

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
-Shut up! Shut up!

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Yeah, noisy boys.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
-We became fans of "Friends"

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
when we were in first year
in college.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
We were too shy
to talk to girls,

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
so "Friends" was a way
to boost our morale

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
and boost our confidence

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
and be able to make new friends,
especially ladies.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
-Yeah, baby.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
-My most favorite episode
on "Friends" is the episode

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
in which Monica asks Chandler
to marry her.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
After seeing that,

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
I knew that is the way
I wanted to ask my soul mate

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
and my husband to marry me,
and that's exactly what I did.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
-I'm a single mom,
and, you know, society pushes us

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
to marry the first guy who does
say, "Will you marry me?"

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
But I mean, as a woman, you have
to take control of your life.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
So watching that episode
got me thinking

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
that I can also take charge
of my own relationship.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
-We're engaged!

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
-I was battling depression.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I was at a very dark place.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
One week, I wouldn't go out.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
The need to even eat
was a problem.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
I wouldn't eat.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
-I was a gay man who wanted to
have hair like Jennifer Aniston.

45:25.000 --> 45:30.000
So you can imagine how lonely
I sometimes felt.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
-And "Friends" was
what I came home to.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
"Friends" was...

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
They were my friends
since I didn't really have any.

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
And, um...I can't.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
-It became a reason
for me to wake up every day

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
because I felt
I had friends around me.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
-Like every Chandler,

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
I found my Monica.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
I'm gonna cry.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
-That's so nice.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
-They have no idea

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
the kind of impact they
partially made in this world,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
so when they sleep,
they should relax

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
knowing that
they have saved more lives,

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
even if they don't know them.
I am one.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
-And for those who don't like
the show, just, uh...

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
-I think you're like Joey 100%,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
because you just walk
into my room

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
with these jokes
that don't make sense.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
-They are funny.
-But you are howling.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Like, you have tears
coming out of your eyes.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
-They're always funny.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
-So, yeah, I think you're Joey

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
with a hint of Phoebe.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
-Vee loves "Friends."

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
And I realize what, like,
this true addiction

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
to a TV show means.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
We watched it together as well.
-And then I got you hooked.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Yes, and that was
my proudest moment.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
When I got her hooked on it,
I was like,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
"Mission accomplished."

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
And then we'd stay up all night
watching it together.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
-You know, "Friends"
brought friends together.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
-Okay, everyone, gather up.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
-One of my favorite moments
from "Friends" is the routine,

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
and that's the show
where Ross and Monica

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
want to perform
their favorite dance.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
-I know what'll get us up
on a platform.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
-What?
-The routine.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
-The routine.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
-Five, six, seven, eight.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
boys

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
boys

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
they've got a halo above them

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
boys

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
boys

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
-It's on the end.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Now, throughout tonight,

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
we're gonna take questions
from the audience.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
There's a lot of fans here.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
Has anybody got a question
tonight

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
for the cast of "Friends"?

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Yes, there's a lady right here.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Yes. What's your question?

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
-So, "Friends" was obviously
amazing for all of you,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
but was there anything
that you didn't like?

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
-Way to keep it positive.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
Was there anything
that you didn't like

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
while you were shooting
the show?

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
-The monkey.
-And the monkey.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
-Oh, the monkey.
-Not Marcel. Really?

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
-The monkey scared me.
-I loved the monkey.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
-David was not a fan.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
-Yeah, 'cause you didn't
have to touch it.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
-What? I did too.
-Yeah, she did. She did.

48:43.000 --> 48:48.000
-Eh. See --

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
First of all, I want to say
I love animals.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I love primates.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I have nothing against animals.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I'm an animal lover.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
However, I'm --

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Here was my problem.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Like, the monkey,

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
obviously, it was trained
and it had to hit its mark

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
and do its thing right at the,
you know, at the perfect time.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
But what inevitably
began to happen

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
was we would
all have choreographed,

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
like, bits kind of timed out,
and it would get messed up

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
because the monkey
didn't do its job right.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
So we'd have to -- we'd have
to -- we'd have to reset.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
We'd have to go again
because the monkey

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
didn't get it right.
-David's so angry still.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
-So this kept happening
over and over

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
where we're about to do
something really funny.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
But the monkey
didn't hit its mark,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
so we have to start again.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
-I would like you to be
more serious about this.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
-That combined -- See, you
didn't have to deal with it.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
And that combined with
when the monkey was resting

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
and just waiting for,
you know, for us to roll,

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
it would sit on my shoulder
and the trainer would come up

49:54.000 --> 49:59.000
and just open and give -- give
the monkey live grubs to eat.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
So the monkey -- the monkey
would be sitting on my shoulder,

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
take some grubs --
take some grubs,

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
like, break them in half,
these squirming, live --

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
then eat it, and then he'd just
go like that.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
So I'd have monkey grubby hands
all over, all over.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
And it just wasn't -- it was --
it was time for Marcel to...

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
off, you know?

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
-I got to say, great question.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
You really threw up
some good answers there.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Alright. Okay. Let's go --

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
I think
we've got another question.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Yes. There's a couple here
in the audience here.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Do you have a question?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
-Yes, I do.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
-Ladies and gentlemen,
it's Mr. and Mrs. Geller.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
Christina Pickles
and Elliott Gould, everybody.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
-Yay!

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
-Eliot, Christina,
I'm keen to know,

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
what do you remember
about that time?

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
-I remember they were
awfully nice to us.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
-Very down-to-earth,
real people.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
-We loved it
because they loved us.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
And one day we came to work
and they said,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
"The parents are here,
the parents are here."

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
And it was so moving.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
And we really did feel
like their parents.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
In fact, we used to worry
about them quite a lot.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
And Elliott said to me,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
"We're behaving like
we're really their parents,"

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
and we really did feel we were
because they're so sweet.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
-We love you.
-That's incredibly sweet.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Thank you so much
for being here tonight.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Fantastic.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
-I'd have to say,
I'm most like Monica

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
because I'm a clean freak.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
You know, I travel a lot

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
and I'm always in hotels.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
I've always got downtime.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
When I'm missing the kids,
when I'm missing the family,

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
I put on "Friends"
because it makes me smile.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
-Orange juice
and what looks like cider.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
-My favorite episode has to be

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
where they're all getting ready
in the apartment.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
-It's fat. I drank fat.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
-Ross is hurrying everyone up

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
because he has a huge speech
to make, and he's nervous.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
-Why aren't you guys dressed?
-We have a half-hour.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
-When Chandler
goes to the toilet,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Joey sits in Chandler's chair,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
and then he comes back
and it all escalates.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
-You're in my seat.
-How is this your seat?

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
-Because I was sitting there.
-But then you left.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
-Well, it's not like
I went to Spain.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
-Joey eventually
gives up his seat,

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
but he takes the cushions
with him.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
-What are you doing?

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
-Well, you said I had
to give you the chair.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
You didn't say anything
about the cushions.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
-The cushions are the essence
of the chair.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
-That's right.
I'm taking the essence.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
-It's one of those episodes
that when I'm away

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
and when I'm feeling
a little bit low,

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
I just put it on

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
and it makes me smile
to almost the point of crying.

52:58.000 --> 53:03.000
-You hide my clothes,
I'm wearing everything you own.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
-Oh, my God.
-Look at me, I'm Chandler.

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
Could I be wearing
any more clothes?

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Maybe if I wasn't
going commando.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
-"The One Where Nobody's Ready,"
it's the first episode

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
we ever did that's shot
in real time like a play.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
-I'll tell you, it's hot
with all this stuff on.

53:22.000 --> 53:26.000
I better not do any,
I don't know, lunges.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
-Some of that was you had
to do some bottle shows.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
You had to do shows that weren't
gonna cost a fortune

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
and keep them located
just on our sets

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
without building new sets,
without, you know.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
So how do you make a story where
you put everybody in one room?

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
-What were you doing when
your arm came out of the socket?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
-Oh.
-Shoulder.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
-That was when he and I
were fighting over the chair.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
-That was one of
the best episodes we ever did.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
-Oh, oh, I remember.
-Okay, you tell it.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
-Firemen.
-Yeah.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
-There were firemen
in the episode.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
-No.
-No? I'm sorry.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
-There were firemen on the set.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
-No, Warner Bros.
fire department

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
came in to help Joey.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
I'm sorry. I take it back.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
-But go ahead
and announce that again.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
That's the best moment
I've had in months.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
-Chandler and Joey have been
fighting over this chair,

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
and Joey runs
and jumps into the chair.

54:21.000 --> 54:26.000
-We shot it three times,
and it went perfectly.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Lord knows why we had
to shoot it a fourth time.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
-You want to go for me
sitting on Matty's lap?

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
-And I went just to jump
over the coffee table

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
and somehow tripped.
-Oh, God.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
-And my legs
went up in the air

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
and my shoulder
came out of the socket.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
-Are we gonna watch this?
His arm getting pulled out?

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
-Oh, here it is.
-Oh, shit.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
-I don't want to see pain.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
-It doesn't look like anything
till I stand up.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
-Okay, okay.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
-Action.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
-Oh, no!

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
-Ow, ow, ow.
It happened right there?

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
-Yeah.
-Did it already happen?

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
-Yeah.
-Shit.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
-Ohh.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
-Oh, are you pulling on it?
Are you pulling the wrong arm?

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
-No, it's the other one.
-It's the other one.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
-No, no, no, no,
it's going down too far.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Oh, shit.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
-Okay, Gretchen?
Just a moment, please.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
Should we cut?
-Ow!

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
-Ohh.
-Ohh.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
-Are you for real?
-Yeah.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
-Yeah, 'cause he
dislocated his shoulder.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
-Oh, I thought someone tried
to pull on it.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Jesus.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
-Cut.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
-So in come all the paramedics
and whatever,

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
and they've got to take him
to the hospital.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
And so that was the end
of filming

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
because it wasn't
even an episode

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
we're like, "Well, we can
shoot out the other scenes."

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
No, it happened to be
on the one episode

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
where it's just the six of them,

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
they're all in it,
and we're done for the night.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
-And the way --
do you remember how

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
the sling was written
into the show?

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
-No.
-Oh.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
-Whoa!

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
-See, Joe,
that's why your parents told you

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
not to jump on the bed.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
-So we had to put that
into the show,

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
but we waited
until he was okay again

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
to film the ending of "The One
Where No One Was Ready."

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
-Did you tell the doctor
you did it

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
jumping up and down on your bed?
-No.

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
-So what started out to be
the simplest "Friends" episode

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
ended up taking the longest
amount of time to shoot.

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
-There was one thing
that we did every show

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
that we didn't do that night
before we started.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
-Our huddle.
-Mm-hmm.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
-We didn't do it that night.
-We didn't do the huddle.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
-We didn't do it?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
-That's the one time
we didn't do it.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
-Why didn't we do it?
-I don't know.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
-That's right, 'cause we were
sort of like,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
"You know what?
We're taking too long.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
The audience has been waiting.
Let's just go."

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
I think that's why
we didn't do it.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
-Really?
-Well, it was sort of early on.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
It wasn't like --
-It was very early on.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
-And then after that,

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
we were like,
"Do we need to do the huddle?"

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
And he'd say, "Yeah."
-Yeah, we do.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
-"'Cause I don't want anything
else falling off me."

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Yeah.
-We do need to do the huddle.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
-After that, we always did it.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
-Let's go see where
we did the huddle.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
-Right here. Let's go.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Straight down
to this purple door.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
-We did the huddle right here.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
-Yeah.
-Right around here.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
-Come on, let's do a huddle.
Come on.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
-Wait. You mean we...

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
-So the atmosphere on tape night
was always crackling.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
There was a lot of energy.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
It was exciting.
You're putting on a show.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
-It was a fun night,

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
but it was a really hard
working night for us

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
and we would listen
to the audience.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
And if a joke didn't land,
even if we loved that joke,

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
they were telling us
it's not good enough.

58:00.000 --> 58:05.000
So we would put our heads
together and try to beat it.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
-It's a buffet.
It's in trouble.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
-It's in trouble,
like I'm gonna go eat it all.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
-How about "Here's where I win
all my money back"?

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
I like that. Great.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
-Kevin, there's a lot
of changes coming.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
-Good shit.
-You guys ready?

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
-Where is the waitress?
I'm starving.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
-It's a buffet, man.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
-Oh, here's where I win
all my money back.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
-I really enjoyed the energy
of the audience, though.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
I mean, the live audience.
-Oh, yeah.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
-I mean...
-I did, too.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
-It's like doing a one-act play
every week with all of us.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
-I found myself, like,

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
when they would laugh
at something,

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
I would think to myself,
"Oh, if you think that's funny,

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
when till you get a load
of this next line."

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
They would challenge me
to try even --

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
I felt this rewarding feeling.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Or not. Or a flat nothing.
-I'm coming over here.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
I feel left out over there.
-Sit here.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
At least to me,

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
I felt like I was gonna die
if they didn't laugh.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
And it's not healthy for sure.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
But I would sometimes
say a line,

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
and they wouldn't laugh,
and I would sweat

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
and -- and just, like,
go into convulsions.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
If I didn't get the laugh
I was supposed to get,

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
I would freak out.
-It would take you down.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
-You didn't tell us that.
-No?

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
-No, I don't remember you
ever saying that.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
-Oh, yeah, I felt like that
every single night.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
-One of the times we listened
to the audience the most

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
was when we were
shooting in London

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
and Monica and Chandler
are in bed together.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
-Action.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
-I'm getting married today!

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
-Morning, Ross.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
-I'm getting married!

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
A-whoo-hoo!
-Whoo-hoo!

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
-Do you think
he knew I was here?

59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.000
-The audience went insane.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.000
-We were just standing there
going "This is insane."

1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:03.000
We just let them go.

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:14.000
-Okay, your turn.

1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:17.000
No, I'm kidding.

1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000
-Cut!
-He told me to say it.

1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000
He did.

1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000
-I think that moment
was the beginning

1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000
of how we rethought
Monica and Chandler,

1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000
'cause the original plan was

1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000
they would sleep together
in London,

1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000
it was a brief thing,

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:32.000
and we'd have some fun
with it afterward

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.000
as they're both like,
"Oh, my God, what did we do?"

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.000
-But the way
the audience reacted,

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:40.000
we realized there's more to this

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.000
and we need to pay attention.

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:45.000
-Well, I've never done that
with you before.

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000
-That was the end
of the season,

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.000
so we had time to really
ruminate and think about it,

1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:58.000
but it was
such a powerful moment

1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.000
that we knew
we had to explore it more.

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:04.000
-We expanded it from just
a "one night in London" thing

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000
to "this could be a thing"
thing.

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.000
-I'm still on London time.
Does that count?

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000
-Oh, that counts.
-Oh, good.

1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000
-We still, at that point,

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.000
didn't quite realize
how far it would go.

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.000
We still thought maybe it'd be
fun with them doing it in secret

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:28.000
and hiding it, which did give us
a lot of funny stuff.

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:32.000
-Hey, it's me. Coming in.

1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.000
-I've had a very long, hard day.

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000
-I love the episode where
they've just returned home

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000
from London
and Monica and Chandler

1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000
are trying to keep it a secret
that they've been hooking up.

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000
-So thanks for having me over.

1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000
-The cast,
they know how powerful

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.000
just, like, a funny visual
set piece will be,

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.000
and it's funnier than anything
they could have ever said.

1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000
-Rach.

1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:16.000
Phoebs.

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000
-See ya.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000
-So the really great thing
about "Friends"

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.000
is they're so good with farce.
-What the hell was that?

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:31.000
-So when there's a secret like
Monica and Chandler are dating,

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000
it's so fun
because we the audience knows,

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000
but none of the rest
of the cast knows.

1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000
-Okay, this is from "The One
Where Everyone Finds Out."

1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:40.000
Ugly naked guy's apartment.

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.000
Phoebe and Rachel have
tagged along with Ross.

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000
Although it's pretty empty,
it's a great place.

1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000
-Oh, my God.

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:50.000
I love this apartment.
Isn't it perfect?

1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:53.000
-I can't believe I never
realized how -- how great it is.

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000
-Well, that is because
your eye immediately

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.000
goes to the big naked man.
-It's amazing.

1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000
You better hurry up
and fill out an application,

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:01.000
or I'm gonna beat you to it.

1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000
-Ohh.

1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.000
-That's sort of how you did it.
-Is that?

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000
-Well, I never thought
I'd say this,

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.000
but, um, I'm gonna go use
ugly naked guy's bathroom.

1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000
-She exits.
Phoebe looks out the window.

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.000
-Oh, look,
there's Monica and Chandler.

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:21.000
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000
-Chandler and Monica
are standing close together.

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000
They start taking off
each other's clothes.

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:27.000
Phoebe's mind is totally blown.

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.000
-Oh! Oh!

1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000
Oh! Oh!

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:37.000
Chandler and Monica!
Chandler and Monica!

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.000
-Rachel sees
what Phoebe is seeing.

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000
-Chandler and Monica!
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000
-Oh! My eyes! My eyes!
-I know.

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.000
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe,
Phoebs, Phoebe.

1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.000
-Oh!
-It's okay. It's okay.

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.000
It's okay.
-They're doing it!

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000
-I know. I know.
I actually know.

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000
I know I know.
-You know?

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000
-I do. I know. And Joey knows.

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:59.000
But Ross doesn't know.
So you have to stop screaming.

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.000
-What's going on?

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000
-What, what?
-Nothing.

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.000
Oh, God, we're just so excited

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000
that you might
get this apartment.

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:10.000
-Actually,
it looks really good.

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:15.000
-Get in here. Come on.
Get in here. Hug it out.

1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000
Hug it out. Hug it out.

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000
-Oh, my God.
Alright.

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000
Yeah, don't get too excited.

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:38.000
I haven't done this
in a long time.

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.000
So I should be Phoebe for this.

1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000
Okay.

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.000
to the vet

1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.000
their favorite pet

1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:09.000
a bed of roses

1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:14.000
of those with noses

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.000
Hi.

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.000
-It's so weird, 'cause
I was walking down the street

1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:27.000
and I just happen to have my...
-Guitar.

1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:32.000
-You need some help?
-Yeah, I mean, I think so.

1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:36.000
-I love "Smelly Cat."
It's one of my favorite songs.

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.000
-Oh, my God.
-You mind if I...

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000
-Oh, please.
-...take "Smelly Cat"

1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:41.000
for a spin?

1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.000
-Yeah, that would be great.
-Alright.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.000
-That was not bad.

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:03.000
-Not -- Was it okay?

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:06.000
-Um, yeah, yeah, it was really,
really good.

1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:08.000
-Thank you so much.

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:11.000
They won't take you
to the vet

1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:16.000
their favorite pet

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:19.000
You may not be
a bed of roses

1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:24.000
of those with noses

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.000
Smelly, smelly, smelly,
really bad, smelly, smelly cat

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:48.000
really bad, smelly, smelly cat

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000
-Yeah. That's right.

1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000
No, but thank you. Thank you.

1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000
This was so great.

1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000
I still think it's better
when it's just me.

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000
-It is.

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:36.000
-Oh, you heard it.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:37.000
-Can I just say something?

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:40.000
Thank you so much
for being the person

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:41.000
for all of us on "Friends"

1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000
that was the -- I don't know if
this is the right way to say it,

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:48.000
but the different one or the one
that was really herself.

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:51.000
-Thank you. And thanks for
carrying it along.

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.000
I'm gonna start crying.
-Yeah.

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:01.000
-There are seasons
I've never seen.

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:03.000
-Me too.
-Really?

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.000
-Yeah.
-I've seen them all.

1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:06.000
I've seen every episode.

1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000
-I would imagine
I've seen them all.

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.000
-Michel and I started watching
some of Season 4,

1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:12.000
which I thought I had watched.

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.000
It's as if I didn't.

1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:16.000
-Do you enjoy them
when you watch them?

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000
-He enjoys them more than I do

1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000
'cause I'm mortified
with myself.

1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:21.000
-Why?
-I don't know.

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000
-You're so good.
-I don't know.

1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:30.000
-Like Lisa, I hadn't seen it
really in 17 years

1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000
until my daughter just started
watching it this past year.

1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.000
And that kind of
sucked me into it.

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:39.000
-For me when I watch it,
it's -- I'm --

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000
it's hard to watch myself,

1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000
but I feel that way
about anything I do

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.000
because I don't believe
the acting that I'm doing,

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000
because I know it's not true,

1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:53.000
'cause it was me doing it.

1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000
-That's what you do
for a living.

1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000
-No, I know, but it's weird
to look at myself.

1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000
I'm like,
"I don't buy a word of it."

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000
It's really weird.

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:06.000
But to watch you guys, I was
just so proud to be on the show.

1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.000
It's just some of the stuff
is so great.

1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.000
-Yeah.
When I do watch the episodes,

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000
I'm laughing out loud
once in every scene

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:17.000
because you all make me
laugh so hard.

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:18.000
-That thing
with the leather pants.

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.000
Oh, my God. That's still --
That was on the other day.

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000
I just happened to be
in the kitchen with Maureen

1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000
and we were eating dinner
and "Friends" is on.

1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:28.000
And I'm like, "Oh, look at that.
Let's see which one it is."

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000
And it happened to be the one
with the leather pants.

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.000
And I said to my daughter,
"Watch this.

1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:36.000
This is funny. Watch David."

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000
And it was really,
really, really funny.

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.000
Every little thing,
like pulling the pants up

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:46.000
and, like, slipping and smacking
yourself in the head.

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000
And I know you.
It was all so calculated.

1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000
Nothing happens
by accident with you.

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000
I've watched you put things
together and it was brilliant.

1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:10.000
-I can't quite
be specific about which one,

1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.000
but I know I'm part
of the Geller family.

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.000
I'm incredibly anal,
I'm neurotic as hell,

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000
and I wear
overly tight trousers.

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000
-Whoa.

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:27.000
-I think one of the reasons
"Friends" is so funny

1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000
is the fact that
these six actors

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000
are masters of physical comedy.

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.000
-Ohh.
-Ohh.

1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000
-There's a scene
with David Schwimmer

1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000
where Ross has decided
not to pay for

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000
the delivery service of a sofa,

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000
and they start taking the couch
up the stairs

1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000
and quite quickly,
everyone gets into trouble.

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:48.000
This is not something that's
gonna go up the stairs.

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000
-Turn.

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000
-I don't think we can turn
anymore.

1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000
-And David Schwimmer
starts telling them to pivot.

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.000
-Here we go, pivot.

1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:00.000
Pivot.

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000
Pivot!

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:05.000
Pivot!

1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000
Pivot!

1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.000
Pivot!

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:12.000
-Shut up, shut up, shut up!

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:16.000
-The thing about
that scene is it's so simple.

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:19.000
If you were to see it
on the page initially,

1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:22.000
it's three actors carrying
a couch up the stairwell.

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.000
There's maybe
a page of dialogue,

1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:28.000
and nothing really in that
dialogue suggests

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000
anything massively comic.

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000
But what they do in that time

1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000
in carrying
that couch up those stairs

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000
is one of the funniest things
I've seen on TV.

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000
-Okay. Here we go.

1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:48.000
-Pivot!

1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.000
Pivot!

1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000
-Alright, let's cut.

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000
-Remember our marks?

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:19.000
Do you remember
what color you were?

1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000
-Yellow.
-Blue.

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000
-You're blue?
-I don't -- I never looked down.

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.000
I always used the corner --

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.000
-You looked.
-I used the corner --

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000
-You tripped every time.
You wouldn't look.

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000
-Wait, what happened?
I don't remember you tripping.

1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000
-The big -- yeah.

1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:34.000
-He ran in,
he looked at his mark --

1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.000
-No, I tripped on that.
-He tripped.

1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:46.000
-He just fell --
-Every single time.

1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:50.000
-And I ran.
-You ran as fast as you could.

1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:53.000
-But the second time I came in
and looked like this.

1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000
I went like this the second
time. I came running.

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000
Phoebs, check it out, check it
out, check it out, check it out.

1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000
-Phoebs, check it out.

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:05.000
-The third time, I went
to pull the chair over,

1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000
and the chair fell over.

1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:11.000
Phoebs, check it out, check it
out, check it out, check it out.

1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:12.000
Jesus.

1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.000
Sorry.

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.000
And the final time, you came in.

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000
-Because I was like,
"Somebody is getting a laugh.

1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:22.000
I can't handle it.

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000
I need to get -- I need
to get a laugh too."

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.000
-Phoebs, Phoebs.

1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000
Check it out, check it out,
check it out, check it out.

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000
-Oh,  Soap Opera Digest.

1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:38.000
Oh, no.

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.000
-That yeti is one smooth talker.

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:47.000
-Yetis are smooth talkers.

1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000
That's why, um...

1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000
-Oh, these are bloopers?

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000
-That yeti is one smooth talker.

1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:56.000
-Yetis are smooth talkers.

1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000
That's why you never see
any pictures.

1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.000
-He cannot play
at our wedding.

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.000
Everyone will leave.

1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000
It'll be like when he rapped
at my "butt" mitzvah.

1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000
-Your "butt" mitzvah?

1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:18.000
-Thank you.

1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:24.000
What?

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:31.000
-How can you keep
straight a face?

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000
-How much do you have
that's good?

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000
-None.
-None of it? Okay.

1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:46.000
-I can't belie--
Oh, I just looked right at you.

1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.000
I'm so sorry.

1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000
-Action.

1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000
-I can't believe
Emma's still asleep.

1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000
-I know.
What are we going to do?

1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000
-Ha-ha, I win.

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:09.000
is that?

1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.000
-Ready?

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000
-Ha-ha, I win!

1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:16.000
-What is that?

1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000
fire,
you jagoff.

1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:24.000
-The game's over.

1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000
Take off your robe.

1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000
-Okay, I mean...

1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.000
-No!
-No!

1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.000
Do not take it off.

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.000
-That was his idea.

1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.000
Matty, that was your idea.
You remember that?

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:48.000
-She carries that
tray to the doctor

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000
because if she doesn't,
people die.

1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:58.000
Oh, no.

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:01.000
-Lisa, your laugh.
Oh, my God.

1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000
-No, it's the greatest thing
in the world.

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:04.000
-It's the most infectious laugh
in the world.

1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:06.000
It's so cute.
-The most infectious sound.

1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:09.000
-The bloopers were so funny.

1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:14.000
When you look back,
who had the loudest laugh?

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.000
Who had the loud --
Oh, really?

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:18.000
-Lisa.
-Really, Lisa Kudrow?

1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:19.000
You had the loudest.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:21.000
-The best laugh.
-I can't help it.

1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000
-The most enjoyable laugh ever.
-Oh, when Lisa laughs --

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:26.000
-Oh, my God.

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:30.000
I can't believe
you didn't say me.

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:42.000
-Maggie Wheeler, everybody.
It's Janice.

1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.000
-Mwah.
How are you?

1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.000
-Maggie Wheeler.

1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:52.000
-Maggie, if you perch
on the corner here,

1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.000
Jen, you come back in,
everyone shift up.

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:58.000
Maggie, if you perch
in here for us.

1:16:58.000 --> 1:16:59.000
Thank you for being here,
Maggie.

1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000
What an absolute thrill.

1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.000
Let's talk about Janice
for a moment.

1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:07.000
Where -- Where did --

1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.000
Where did Janice come from?

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:14.000
-You know, I got the audition
sides across my fax machine,

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000
and it said
"fast-talking New Yorker,"

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.000
and I thought, you know,
I know her.

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:20.000
I-I grew up there.

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:23.000
I-I just -- She lives in me.
That's it.

1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:26.000
-You love me, Chandler Bing.

1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:33.000
-Oh, no, I don't.

1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:34.000
-You seek me out.

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:40.000
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn.

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:44.000
Janice, Janice.

1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:47.000
You want me, you need me,

1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.000
you can't live without me.

1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000
-Matthew Perry is so funny.

1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.000
And the minute I set eyes on him
and he opened his mouth,

1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000
I thought, "Oh, God,
I'm gonna lose it.

1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:56.000
I'm gonna crack up.

1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:58.000
This character needs a laugh
because I'm not gonna be able

1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.000
to get through a single scene
with this guy."

1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.000
And I just looked at him,
and I went

1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:05.000
And that was it.

1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.000
It was just born in the moment.

1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:10.000
Thank you, Matthew,
for inspiring that.

1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:13.000
Anyway, everybody, oh, my God.

1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000
The "Friends" reunion.

1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:18.000
And I get to be a part of it.
-Maggie Wheeler, everybody.

1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:19.000
Thank you so much.

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.000
Bless you.
Maggie Wheeler, everybody.

1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:26.000
What about that?
What a treat.

1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:30.000
-Oh, I love her.

1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:33.000
-Now, I should say
there was somebody very,

1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:35.000
very special involved
in the show

1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.000
who couldn't be here tonight

1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:41.000
but so desperately wanted
to be part of the show,

1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:44.000
he's joining us
on Zoom right now.

1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:48.000
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome James Michael Tyler.

1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.000
He's here.
It's Gunther.

1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000
Gunther himself, everybody!

1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.000
He's here.

1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000
-Hey, what's up, everybody?

1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.000
-How are you?

1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:00.000
-Good to see you.
You all look great.

1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.000
-Tell us about your experience
making the show

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.000
and how your character
just came to life

1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.000
over the course
of these seasons.

1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:11.000
-It was the most memorable
10 years of my life, honestly.

1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:18.000
I could not have imagined
just a better experience.

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000
All these guys were fantastic.

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:21.000
It was just a joy
to work with them.

1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.000
I felt very, very special.

1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.000
-Rachel?
-Yeah?

1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:26.000
-When's your birthday?

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000
-May 5th. Why?

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000
-Oh, I-I'm just making a list
of people's birthdays.

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:33.000
-Oh, mine's December --
-Yeah, whatever.

1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000
-Ladies and gentlemen,
James Michael Tyler,

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.000
Gunther himself.

1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000
-Thanks.

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:46.000
-I mean, will you allow me
to ask

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:50.000
what I would consider
to be a cheeky question?

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:54.000
It's impossible not to realize
and see that you were all young,

1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:59.000
hot, good-looking,
successful actors.

1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:03.000
And it's inconceivable to me
that there weren't

1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:07.000
perhaps off-screen romances.

1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:12.000
-Well, I mean, David?

1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:14.000
-Yeah.

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:17.000
Yeah, I mean, the --
-The first season.

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:18.000
-Yeah, the first season, we --

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:22.000
I had a major crush on Jen.

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.000
I --
-It was reciprocated.

1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:27.000
-And I think we both
at some point,

1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:29.000
we were both crushing hard
on each other,

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.000
but it was like
two ships passing

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:35.000
because one of us
was always in a relationship.

1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:38.000
So -- And we never crossed
that boundary.

1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000
You know, we respected that.

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000
And -- but we both --
-Bullshit.

1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000
-No, no.

1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:49.000
No.

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.000
-I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:54.000
-It's true. It's true.

1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:57.000
-Honestly, I remember
saying one time to David,

1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:00.000
"It's going to be such a bummer
if the first time you and I

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.000
actually kiss is gonna be
on national television."

1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:08.000
Sure enough,
first time we kissed

1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:11.000
was in that coffee shop.
-Hang on, so --

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:14.000
-But so we just channeled
all of our adoration and love

1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:16.000
for each other
into Ross and Rachel.

1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000
-Is this blowing
anyone else's mind?

1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000
Wait. Hang on.

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:29.000
-That scene in the coffee house
when their first kiss,

1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:33.000
I mean, that was like --
I watched it the other day,

1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:34.000
and I was weeping.

1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:38.000
The tension,
it was just palpable.

1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000
The -- It was just perfect.

1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.000
I'm so glad you guys didn't
because I don't know --

1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000
well, you would've
just been great actors.

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000
But, man, that was something.
-Yeah, we were really

1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:47.000
just not great actors.

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:54.000
-Interior, coffee house
late that night.

1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000
Rachel's putting up chairs.

1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:59.000
Ross enters agitated.

1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.000
-Hi.
-I didn't get a cat.

1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:04.000
-Oh. That's interesting.

1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.000
-No, no, it's not interesting,
okay?

1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000
It's very, very not interesting.

1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:12.000
It's actually 100% completely
the opposite of interesting.

1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.000
-Alright. Alright.
I get it, Ross.

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:17.000
-You had no right to tell me
you ever had feelings for me.

1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:19.000
-What?
-I was doing great with Julie

1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:21.000
before I found out about you.

1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:24.000
-Hey, I was doing great
before I found out about you.

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:27.000
You think it's easy for me
to see you with Julie?

1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:30.000
-Well, then you should have
said something before I met her.

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:31.000
-I didn't know then.

1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.000
And how come you
never said anything to me?

1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.000
-There was never a good time.

1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:36.000
-Right,
because you only had a year

1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000
and we only hung out
every night.

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:41.000
-Not -- Not every night.

1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:43.000
You know, and it's not like
I didn't --

1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:46.000
I didn't try, Rachel,
but things got in the way,

1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000
you know, like --
like Italian guys

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:54.000
or, uh, ex-fiancés,
or -- or -- or Italian guys.

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.000
-Hey, there was one Italian guy,
okay?

1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.000
And do you even have a point?

1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:03.000
-Yeah, the point is, I-I don't
need this right now, okay?

1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000
It's too late.
I'm with somebody else.

1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.000
Okay? I'm happy.
This ship has sailed.

1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:08.000
-Okay, so what are you saying?

1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:10.000
You can just sort of
put away feelings

1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:11.000
or whatever the hell it was
that you felt for me?

1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000
-Hey, I've been doing it
since the ninth grade.

1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:14.000
I've gotten
pretty damn good at it.

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:15.000
-Alright, fine.
You go ahead and you do that.

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:17.000
Alright, Ross?

1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:18.000
'Cause I don't need
your stupid ship.

1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.000
-Good.
-Good.

1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:22.000
And you know what?

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000
Now I got closure.

1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000
-He storms out.

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:29.000
Furious, Rachel locks the three
locks on the front door.

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:48.000
-Then she stops, leans on
a table and drops her head.

1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000
When she looks up,
she's startled to see Ross

1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:53.000
at the door staring back at her.

1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:00.000
They hold each other's gaze.

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:04.000
She steps slowly towards
the door, then more quickly,

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:08.000
she unlocks the first lock,
the second, the third,

1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000
and then goes to pull
the door open.

1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.000
-Try -- Try the bottom one.

1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:29.000
-The door flies open,
Ross rushes in, grabs her,

1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000
and they kiss.

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:39.000
-Yay!

1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:43.000
-Ohh.
-That was good.

1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:46.000
-I thought back on the very
first year or two, you know,

1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000
when we had breaks
from rehearsal,

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:51.000
like, there were moments
we would, like, cuddle

1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:52.000
on a couch or something.

1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:53.000
-We would spoon
and fall asleep on the couch.

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:01.000
-And I'm thinking,

1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:02.000
"How did not everyone know

1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:05.000
we had -- were crushing
on each other?"

1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000
-We knew. We knew.

1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:08.000
-Yeah, we knew for sure.

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000
-Great. Now. Thanks.

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000
It was a situation
that we couldn't --

1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.000
we couldn't
do anything about it.

1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000
-How great, though,
ultimately,

1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000
'cause if you had
and it didn't work out,

1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:26.000
it would not have
probably been as great.

1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000
-I'm gonna go down
and ask each of you,

1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.000
and this is just a simple
yes or no answer.

1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000
-Okay.
-Okay?

1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:42.000
Were Ross and Rachel on a break?

1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000
-Absolutely. Yes.
-Yes.

1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:47.000
-Yes.
-Yes.

1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.000
-Yeah, we were on a break.

1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000
-Yeah.

1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:04.000
-We had amazing guest stars
on our show.

1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:05.000
Couldn't believe
all these people

1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.000
that we were all
massive fans of.

1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000
-Yeah.
-We had Danny DeVito.

1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:15.000
-Did someone call
for the long arm of the law?

1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000
-Oh, my God, was he funny.
-Oh, that was so funny.

1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:20.000
-I remember -- Oh, my gosh.
-Ben Stiller.

1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000
-Ben.
One of our biggest laughs ever.

1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000
Remember when Ben --
when we went over there?

1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000
-What are you quacking about?

1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:29.000
Ooh, quack, quack, Donald Dodo.

1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000
-"You chickadee,
you little chickadoo."

1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:41.000
It was so funny.

1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000
I don't know
why it was so funny.

1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.000
-'Cause he's funny.
-'Cause of Ben Stiller.

1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:49.000
-And Julia Roberts.
-Julia Roberts.

1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:52.000
-That's right.
-And who enjoyed Julia Roberts?

1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:55.000
-Come on.

1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:01.000
-Your fella Brad.
-Pitt came, did one.

1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.000
-Rachel Green.

1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.000
God, I hate her, Ross.
I hate her.

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:14.000
-And, of course, we had
one of my idols, Sean Penn.

1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.000
-Aren't you gonna
give me a kiss?

1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:16.000
-Okay, I will.

1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:18.000
But right after, you have to
tell me who the hell you are.

1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:21.000
-And then we get the script
and, of course,

1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:24.000
I realize that "Oh,
I'm a -- I'm a potato."

1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000
Hey.
-Hey.

1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000
-Oh, 'cause it was
the Halloween episode.

1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.000
-So I had no --

1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000
like very little,
if any, dialogue with him.

1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:35.000
But here I'm thinking
"Greatest actor in the world,

1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.000
potato.

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:37.000
I'm a potato."

1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:39.000
-Oh, my God. You're Sputnik.

1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000
-Yes.

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:44.000
-Marry her.

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:48.000
-Now, there's been some
incredibly memorable outfits

1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.000
and costumes over the 10 seasons
of "Friends,"

1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.000
and we thought we'd take a look

1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:00.000
at some of those iconic costumes
right here tonight

1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:05.000
with our very own
"Friends" reunion fashion show.

1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:06.000
Cue the music.

1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:12.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage

1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000
Cara Delevingne.

1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:20.000
Cara is modeling
Rachel's bridesmaid dress

1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:25.000
from Barry and Mindy's wedding
in Season 2.

1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:27.000
Look at that.
-Yes.

1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:29.000
-As far as
bridesmaid dresses go,

1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000
it's actually quite understated.

1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:35.000
Modeling Ross's leather pants
from Season 5,

1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.000
it's Cindy Crawford.

1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000
-Yeah!

1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:50.000
-These are Ross's
incredibly tight pants,

1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:53.000
but once he got them on,
he couldn't get them off again,

1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:58.000
and I think we've all
been there.

1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.000
It's Sputnik time,

1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:02.000
and I know when
you think of Sputnik,

1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:06.000
you think of the one,
the only Justin Bieber.

1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:07.000
-What?
-What?

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:17.000
-It's part Russian satellite,
part potato.

1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:23.000
Look at that. Justin Bieber,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:27.000
It's astonishing that he's even
managed to make that look cool.

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:37.000
And next up, perhaps the most
famous look of them all,

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.000
it's Santa's half-Jewish friend.

1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:44.000
It's the Holiday Armadillo.

1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:51.000
Cara Delevingne,
ladies and gentlemen,

1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:53.000
as the Holiday Armadillo.

1:29:55.000 --> 1:30:00.000
-Oh, my God. That's amazing.
Whoo!

1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:04.000
-This surely is a high point
in her modeling career.

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000
-Yeah, baby.
-Work it, work it!

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:11.000
-That's amazing.

1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:12.000
-And, ladies and gentlemen,

1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:15.000
wearing all of
Chandler's clothes,

1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:17.000
it's Matt LeBlanc!

1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:21.000
How did you do that?

1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:23.000
How did you do that?

1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:27.000
You are so cute.

1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:28.000
Oh, my God.

1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:31.000
-Could he be wearing
any more clothes?

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:34.000
-Yeah, Matty!

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:49.000
-The "Friends" finale
and their farewell party.

1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:51.000
Tonight, the cast
is taping the last episode

1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:53.000
of their historic sitcom.

1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:54.000
Here I am
on the set of "Friends"

1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:56.000
in Monica
and Chandler's apartment,

1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:01.000
where in just hours, the show
that made TV must-see must end.

1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:04.000
-If the show was about
that time in your life

1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.000
when your friends
are your family,

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:09.000
once you have family
of your own,

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.000
it's no longer that time.

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:14.000
So the show came,
I think, to a natural end.

1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:19.000
-It was really important for us
to end everyone in a good place.

1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:25.000
We wanted to know
that Monica and Chandler

1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:27.000
were gonna have their babies.

1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:28.000
-Hey.

1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:29.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:31.000
-

1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:34.000
-And that Phoebe was gonna
be happy and had a life.

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:36.000
-I want one.

1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:37.000
-Oh, yeah?

1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:40.000
Well, tell me which one.
I'll try to slip it in my coat.

1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000
-There was some discussion
in the writers room

1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:46.000
about do we really want
Ross and Rachel to get together?

1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:50.000
-Rachel?
-I'm so sorry.

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:54.000
-And we discussed perhaps
sort of ambivalent endings

1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.000
where it seemed like
down the --

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:58.000
and we went,
"No, this is 'Friends.'

1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:01.000
People have been
waiting 10 years

1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:03.000
to see this couple get together.

1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:04.000
We've got to give them
what they want.

1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:07.000
We just have to find
a way to do it

1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:08.000
so the journey is unexpected."

1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.000
-Isn't there any way that you
could just let me off the --

1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:14.000
-No! No!

1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:16.000
Oh, my God.
Did she get off the plane?

1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:17.000
Did she get off the plane?!

1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.000
-I got off the plane.

1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:42.000
-Cut!

1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:59.000
-The night itself was
very difficult to get through.

1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:03.000
I really wanted to savor
every minute of it.

1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:06.000
I knew it was going to end,
and I didn't want it to end.

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:08.000
-Adiós, arrivederci, au revoir.

1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:11.000
Take one, five cameras.

1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:18.000
-Okay, should we
get some coffee?

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:19.000
-Sure.

1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:21.000
-Okay.

1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:23.000
-Where?

1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:36.000
-And cut.

1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:38.000
-The minute it was over...

1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000
-Marta and I looked
at each other,

1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.000
and I just kind of
went to pieces.

1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:45.000
-Yeah, there was a lot of crying
that night.

1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:48.000
-I don't know how we got
through actual scenes.

1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:51.000
-I remember that moment,
all of us up

1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:54.000
at the end of the hall there.

1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:55.000
-That was nice.
It was, like, private.

1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000
-Yeah.

1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:01.000
-I feel emotional about it now
that I think about it.

1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:08.000
It was not just the end
of a series.

1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:12.000
It was the end of 10 years
of relationships.

1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:16.000
I mean, we were really,
really proud of the show,

1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:19.000
but like anything good,
it's sad when it's over.

1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:05.000
-That night, right after
I called wrap...

1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:07.000
Cut.

1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:09.000
...the sets immediately started
to be taken down

1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:12.000
because there was a pilot
that was coming into

1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000
the stage the next day.

1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.000
-That last day,
seeing them strike the set,

1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000
it's like seeing someone
pack up your childhood home.

1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000
It's gone.

1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000
-We ended up with
an impromptu party

1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.000
where everybody just stayed
on set and sat there,

1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:35.000
and we ordered pizza and beer,
people signed the flats,

1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:42.000
and it was an incredibly
lovely, moving night.

1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000
-Did we all sign this
at the end?

1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.000
-Oh, we all signed this.
-Wendy.

1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:51.000
-Oh.
-Carlos!

1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:52.000
-Oh, there's mine.

1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000
-What?
-What is it?

1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000
-"I shit here."
That's right.

1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:01.000
-I knew it!

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:03.000
-Of course that's you.

1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000
-"The best 10 years of my life.

1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:09.000
Love to all."
-That's me.

1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:10.000
-Oh, yeah.
-That's nice.

1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:11.000
-That is nice.

1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:13.000
-Marika!
-Not as nice as mine.

1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.000
-No.

1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000
-We're here now,
all six of you.

1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:21.000
Lisa, has it crossed
your mind about, you know,

1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:24.000
well, maybe we could
do another episode,

1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000
maybe we could do a movie?

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000
Is that something
you'd ever even contemplate?

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:31.000
-No, no.

1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:33.000
I'm sorry. I haven't.

1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:36.000
No, because that's
all up to Marta and David,

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000
and I once heard them say,

1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000
and I completely agree,

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:45.000
that they ended the show
very nicely.

1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.000
Everyone's lives are very nice,
and they would have to unravel

1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:53.000
all those good things in order
for there to be stories.

1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:56.000
And, yeah, I don't want anyone's
happy ending unraveled.

1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:59.000
Yeah.
Also at my age to be, say, like,

1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:00.000
floopy, stop.

1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000
You have to grow up.
-Well, let me ask you this.

1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:10.000
Where do you think your
characters would be today?

1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:11.000
Where's Rachel?

1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:15.000
-Rachel. Rachel -- I think
we're -- did we get married?

1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:16.000
Let's say we got married.
-Sure.

1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000
-Okay.
-

1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:21.000
I think we ended up getting
married, and we had some kids.

1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:22.000
-Kids, yeah.
-And you still played

1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000
with bones.
-Still playing with bones.

1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:25.000
-Playing with bones, and --

1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000
-That's paleontology.

1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:30.000
-Paleontology,
still a paleontologist.

1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000
It gets Joey every time.
I don't know why.

1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:35.000
Playing with bones.

1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:37.000
-Playing with the bones.

1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:41.000
-So you guys are together.
You're happy.

1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:43.000
You've got kids.
-Yes.

1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000
-Where are Monica and Chandler?

1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:48.000
-I think my character, Monica,
is still really competitive.

1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:51.000
Her kids are probably
not even in -- you know,

1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:52.000
they're probably graduated.

1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.000
But she still is in charge
of the bake sale

1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000
at, you know,
an elementary school.

1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000
She's just got
to keep things going.

1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000
PTA, you know.

1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:04.000
And you are making me
laugh every day.

1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:10.000
-I just wanted to make sure
I factored in there somewhere.

1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.000
-And what's Phoebe doing?

1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000
-Phoebe's married to Mike.
They're probably in Connecticut.

1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:16.000
They had kids.

1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000
And I think she was like
the advocate for her kids,

1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000
who were a little different
and all the other kids

1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000
who were just a little
different, you know?

1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:26.000
Creating the arts program and
the music thing and all that.

1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:27.000
Yeah.

1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000
-And where's Joey?

1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.000
-I think he probably opened
a sandwich shop in Venice Beach.

1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:33.000
-Oh!

1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:36.000
Oh, I wish he would.

1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000
I wish he would
-Why not?

1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.000
-I wish he would.

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000
-Here's Courteney Cox.

1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.000
My sister on the show.

1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000
-Honest, this will
really make me cry,

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:57.000
but this will be the last time
that we're ever asked

1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:00.000
about the show as a group,
that we will do this.

1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:03.000
Like, we're not going to
do this again in 15 more years.

1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:05.000
I'll tell you one thing.

1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.000
We are not waiting
so long to have a dinner.

1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.000
-No, we're not. We will not wait
that long to get together.

1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:16.000
-I have really enjoyed today.
I really have.

1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:20.000
I didn't know, like, kind of
what to expect coming into this.

1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000
I knew it was going
to be awesome

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:26.000
to see these five people.

1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:31.000
What I did not take into account
was being back on the set...

1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000
-No.
-...and in this environment.

1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:36.000
And it's...it's...

1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:37.000
it's pretty cool.

1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000
Yeah.

1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:43.000
-Just please also state that
I don't cry like this

1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:44.000
when we get together
and have dinners.

1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000
-Yeah, no. Jen never cries.

1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.000
I mean, it was
an incredible time.

1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:02.000
Everything came together.

1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:05.000
We became best friends who --

1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000
just the chemistry,
the whole thing.

1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.000
It was life-changing,
and it forever will be.

1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:11.000
Not just for us,
but for people who watch it.

1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:16.000
And that's just such a great
feeling to carry forever.

1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000
I'm really thankful,
and I love you guys so much.

1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:22.000
-I love you so much.

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000
-It's Courteney?
-It's Courteney.

1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:50.000
-The best way that I can
describe it is

1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:54.000
after the show was over,
at a party or any kind of

1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:58.000
social gathering, if one of
us bumped into each other,

1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000
that was it,
that was the end of the night.

1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000
You just...
-Sat with that person.

1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000
-...sat with the person
all night long.

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:05.000
-That's true. I remember.

1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:07.000
-And that was it.

1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:09.000
You apologized to
the people you were with,

1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:13.000
but they had to understand you
had met somebody special to you

1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:14.000
and you were going to talk
to that person

1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:17.000
for the rest of the night.

1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:18.000
And that's the way...
-I'm not laughing, I'm crying

1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:21.000
because it's so true.
-That's the way it worked.

1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:33.000
It's certainly the way it works
with all of us.

1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000
It's just the way it is.

1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:38.000
-Mm-hmm.

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000
-I'm going to cry now.

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:41.000
Good.

1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000
-I've got a piece of a Kleenex.

1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000
-Thanks. I'll take it.

1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.000
-It's been COVID tested.

1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:48.000
-Thank you. I'll take it.
COVID tested?

1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:50.000
-COVID tested.

1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.000
-Ladies and gentlemen,
the cast of "Friends."

1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:15.000
So no one told you life
was gonna be this way

1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:18.000
you're broke

1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:25.000
stuck in second gear

1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:28.000
your day, your week

1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:31.000
or even your year, but

1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000
for me, too
