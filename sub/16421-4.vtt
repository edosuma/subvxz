WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:04.170
[chattering]

00:04.295 --> 00:05.755
What's so exciting?

00:05.839 --> 00:07.465
Just the greatest drummer in Austin.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.426
I don't know if I'm the greatest.

00:09.801 --> 00:12.595
Not you. Lawrence built a drum machine.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.266
[drumming]

00:17.684 --> 00:20.729
As an old school rocker I am opposed
to haircuts,

00:20.812 --> 00:23.064
the man and a machine making music.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.358
But that box rocks.

00:26.317 --> 00:28.403
Okay, we already have a drum machine,
Lawrence,

00:28.486 --> 00:29.946
and its mom drives you to soccer.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.407
I didn't build the thing to replace you,
buddy.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.491
Good.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.910
The Freddy 5000 has nothing
to do with you.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.913
[drumming]

00:39.664 --> 00:43.585
Wow.
It's like Freddy but 5000 times better.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.296
Okay, at least it doesn't have my hair.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.464
Actually, it does.

00:50.341 --> 00:56.139
No machine could come close to Fre--
O-M-G, it's so adorable! I want to hug it.

00:56.681 --> 01:00.977
And while humans get tired,
nothing can stop the Freddy 5000.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.356
-Really?
-[crashing]

01:07.484 --> 01:09.069
I see you've found its flaw.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.906
Like so many other drummers
that went out smashed on the floor.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.867
So now we can go back
to rockin' old school.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.745
Actually, not yet.
I have to hit the little rockers room.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.542
Principal Mullins is coming down the hall.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.628
Why didn't the alarm go off? Stall her!

01:27.587 --> 01:30.048
Okay, everybody, we're at DEF CON Mullins.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.301
Lawrence,
did you disconnect the security system

01:33.384 --> 01:36.387
to plug in your drum machine?
That is so irrespon--

01:36.471 --> 01:37.889
Somebody's cell phone's plugged in.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.599
Oh, it's mine.

01:40.058 --> 01:43.311
In my defense,
I got mad before I knew I was the problem.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.189
DEF CON Mullins!

01:48.149 --> 01:51.945
Principal Mullins, hi.
Um, I need to talk to you.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.738
-[crashing]
-[Finn screaming]

01:54.906 --> 01:57.242
But not here, too many people around.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.328
But t-there's no one.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.039
What are you sharpening these, Freddy?!

02:03.498 --> 02:04.499
[crashing]

02:04.582 --> 02:07.460
This is another great argument
for the drum machine.

02:07.585 --> 02:08.878
[crashing]

02:09.170 --> 02:10.880
Stupid drum machine.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.095
This is better.
So, what did you want to tell me?

02:18.555 --> 02:20.890
-Uh.
-Wait.

02:23.143 --> 02:27.147
Principal Mullins.
I just remembered what I wanted to say.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.609
-Can I have a hug?
-Uh, no.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.489
And that's why there are two I's
in Hawai-i.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.284
[throat clearing] Excuse me, Mr. Finn.

02:39.450 --> 02:41.870
Oh, Principal Mullins, what a surprise.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.580
We had no idea you were going
to come visit our class.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.040
Why would we? It's not as if we keep tabs
on your movements.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.667
Why would I even say that?

02:49.210 --> 02:52.130
Well, attendance has been down
the last few dances.

02:52.255 --> 02:55.550
So to get more kids on the dance floor
for the fall dance

02:55.633 --> 02:59.512
we found a little money in the budget
to really goose up the fun factor.

03:00.805 --> 03:05.101
We're going to allow the whip,
the nae nae, ooh, but not the stanky leg.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.980
Consider our fun factors
officially goosed.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.064
High five.

03:10.607 --> 03:14.110
Oh, no, Mr. Finn,
this is a workplace, not a dog track.

03:14.819 --> 03:15.820
Okay.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.867
-[sighing]
-The dances here are so lame.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.952
Yeah, they always let Clark be the DJ.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.330
Yo everybody in the hizzouse.

03:25.413 --> 03:28.583
DJ Igneous here,
'cause I know how to rock.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.920
-[adult contemporary music]
-[record scratching]

03:33.004 --> 03:34.547
[horn sounding]

03:34.631 --> 03:36.633
-[booing]
-[record scratching]

03:37.550 --> 03:39.302
I wish we could play the fall dance.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.012
-[chattering]
-Why can't we?

03:41.387 --> 03:45.683
If I know one thing,
if you get the chance to rock you rock.

03:45.975 --> 03:46.976
[all] Yeah.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.605
Except when you need to keep
the band a secret from everyone at school,

03:50.688 --> 03:52.690
and the dance is at school.

03:53.816 --> 03:56.861
I know. But it would be so cool
to play in front of everyone.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.822
They wouldn't have to know it's us,
just seeing our school rock out

03:59.906 --> 04:01.115
to our music would be enough.

04:01.574 --> 04:05.328
[gasping] What if we wear disguises
like Daft Punk or KISS?

04:05.662 --> 04:06.663
KISS.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.790
No costumes.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.752
As manager
of the band I still say it's too risky.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.672
-Come on.
-[clamouring]

04:15.922 --> 04:20.009
If the school and our parents find out
it'll ruin everything we've worked for.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.553
-I'm putting my foot down.
-[stomping]

04:23.054 --> 04:24.681
Well, I guess it's okay.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.975
Kale already asked me
if I would dance with her on Saturday,

04:27.058 --> 04:29.102
so it would be pretty hard
if I was playing in the band.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.272
I'm picking my foot up!
We're playing that dance.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.520
Wow, your inner lights are
shimmering today.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.897
Yeah, I put a new bulb in mine last night.

05:14.981 --> 05:21.195
[laughing] Tomika, you are so funny.
And Summer, you are so smart.

05:21.738 --> 05:25.450
You're both just amazing people. Bye!

05:27.368 --> 05:29.495
She's a monster.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.081
I don't know, she seems pretty nice.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.167
That's what makes her so terrible.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.378
I wanted Freddy to dance with me, not her.

05:37.545 --> 05:38.755
It's just a dance.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.091
Don't you see?
It all starts with a first dance,

05:42.341 --> 05:43.593
then they start hanging out,

05:43.801 --> 05:46.179
then they get engaged,
get married, have kids,

05:46.304 --> 05:49.098
then grandkids, and I'm stuck
with you pushing a bunch

05:49.223 --> 05:50.933
of tiny dogs in a baby stroller!

05:51.267 --> 05:53.394
Wait, why is my life ruined?

05:54.979 --> 05:56.564
I have to keep Freddy away from Kale.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.109
Summer, tell him how you feel.
Come on, girl up.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.112
I'm going to. Next time I see him.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.032
Really? Here he comes, now's your chance.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.951
-Hey Freddy.
-Hey Tomika.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.161
Summer.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.164
Freddy, I, uh...

06:15.625 --> 06:16.626
Eep.

06:19.504 --> 06:24.550
She's training for a 5k. So am I.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.180
-Mr. Finn.
-What's up, Freduardo?

06:29.263 --> 06:30.264
Maybe you can help me.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.517
Kale seemed really excited
about us dancing together.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.645
Mm, sorry buddy, I'm not dancing with you.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.980
Not you and me, me and Kale dancing.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.065
Oh.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.775
Yeah, she keeps talking about it,

06:40.858 --> 06:43.778
and now that School of Rock is playing
I can't dance with her.

06:43.986 --> 06:46.989
So, how do I get out
of it without hurting her feelings?

06:47.615 --> 06:51.285
I think you're talking to the right guy.
I'm a bit of an expert in this area.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.453
Being smooth with the ladies?

06:52.537 --> 06:53.996
No, getting dumped.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.291
I've lost count of how many women have
gotten out of dates with me.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.627
One faked her own death.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.130
Okay, I don't know that's--

07:02.213 --> 07:04.882
Yeah, yeah, in order
to do it right you kind of need a grave

07:04.966 --> 07:06.717
and a New Orleans' style jazz band.

07:09.178 --> 07:12.432
[trumpeting]

07:15.435 --> 07:16.519
Guys, those are rad.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.813
Are those the disguises we're going
to use to play the dance?

07:18.980 --> 07:20.565
Well, we like these.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.233
But we have one hold out.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.737
Greetings, my fellow Americans.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.909
We are engaged in a great civil war.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.705
Even with the beard I can tell it's you,
Lawrence.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.333
Who is this Lawrence you speak of?

07:39.709 --> 07:43.379
My name is Abraham something Lincoln.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.217
Ain't gonna happen, Abe.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.265
Okay, everybody, huddle up.
Let's go over the plan again.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.018
We all show up
to the student council meeting.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.189
We all laugh at your
clever joke about the gavel. Ha ha ha.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.524
But not so much that it seems rehearsed.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.319
Hee hee hee. Happy?

08:08.821 --> 08:12.658
Then Summer explains the rule that allows
the student council to choose the music.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.162
Then I stand up
and I nominate School of Rock.

08:16.996 --> 08:20.041
I second it, then I start chanting,
"School of Rock".

08:20.500 --> 08:22.835
And then we play the dance
and it's the best one ever.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.795
Okay, let's do this.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.089
Wait, Tomiks.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.592
There's one more part of the plan.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.177
What?

08:31.511 --> 08:32.512
I'm going to do it.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.055
Do what?

08:35.056 --> 08:36.724
I'm going
to tell Freddy how I feel at the dance.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.852
Down here. Tying my shoe.

08:42.980 --> 08:48.611
So the judge says I'm not making
a verdict, I'm making a pound cake.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.904
[pounding]

08:50.112 --> 08:52.156
Ha ha, ha ha ha.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.408
I'm laughing just the right amount.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.955
Summer, before we begin,
do I have time to go to the bathroom?

08:59.038 --> 09:00.331
Sure, Asher.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.167
[pounding]

09:03.376 --> 09:05.211
-First order of business.
-But you said I could--

09:05.294 --> 09:06.462
-No, sit down!
-Okay.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.757
Music for the fall dance.

09:09.924 --> 09:13.135
Got you covered. DJ Igneous in the house.

09:13.844 --> 09:15.012
Frozen magma, y'all.

09:16.138 --> 09:20.643
[accordion playing]

09:22.186 --> 09:25.314
According to our bar laws
the student council must open the floor

09:25.439 --> 09:27.775
to all suggestions for musical
entertainment.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.237
Freddy!

09:32.488 --> 09:34.073
He didn't even have his hand up.

09:34.198 --> 09:37.076
Oh, I saw a hand all right. Freddy?

09:37.994 --> 09:41.414
Uh, uh, I second Zack's motion.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.874
He hasn't even made a motion.

09:43.958 --> 09:47.712
Uh, uh, I think what Freddy is trying
to say

09:48.212 --> 09:50.840
that there's this new band that just won
Austin's battle of the bands,

09:50.923 --> 09:52.925
and it's called School of Rock.

09:53.968 --> 09:57.221
Live music, you say?
And what a great name for a band.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.849
And how impressive that they won
at Battle of the Bands.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.183
-And--
-Okay.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.563
All in favour of School of Rock, say--

10:05.646 --> 10:07.231
-Hold it.
-I can't.

10:08.482 --> 10:11.027
I think we've had a pretty good thing
for the last couple years.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.403
Let me just give you a taste.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.031
Hizzity hizzity h-- [gasping]

10:19.577 --> 10:23.956
[gasping, coughing]

10:24.248 --> 10:25.875
Okay.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.335
All in favour of School--

10:27.418 --> 10:28.878
Wait a minute. [throat clearing]

10:29.795 --> 10:33.883
Why are you guys so interested
in this School of Rock anyway?

10:34.008 --> 10:35.009
No reason.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.553
Hey. I think you guys are--

10:37.637 --> 10:38.638
School of Rock.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.930
[all] School of Rock!

10:40.014 --> 10:42.808
Order, order. It's time to vote.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.143
All in favour of Clark?

10:44.644 --> 10:47.188
Yeah boy. Clark is the snizzle.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.524
All in favour of School of Rock?

10:50.608 --> 10:51.692
[all] School of Rock!

10:52.068 --> 10:53.653
School of Rock! School of Rock!

10:53.736 --> 10:55.446
But I'm a wiz at the turntables.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.323
-Don't say wiz!
-[all] School of Rock!

10:57.531 --> 10:59.867
School of Rock! School of Rock!

11:00.076 --> 11:02.620
School of Rock! School of Rock!

11:02.745 --> 11:08.084
[chanting continues]

11:11.212 --> 11:14.924
And they were all chanting,
"School of Rock, School of Rock!"

11:15.007 --> 11:16.217
You should've been there, Mr. Finn.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.927
It was so epic.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.095
We got a gig.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.471
I'm going to pay back the money

11:20.554 --> 11:22.223
I borrowed from my guy named
"The Crippler".

11:22.556 --> 11:23.724
We're not getting paid.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.394
Why didn't I borrow money from a guy named
"The Cuddler?"

11:27.561 --> 11:28.771
[alarm Sounding]

11:28.854 --> 11:30.439
Oh no, Principal Mullins!

11:30.606 --> 11:33.567
Okay, everybody, scramble.
This is not a drill.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.405
I'll get that for you, Chief.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.365
I love that you're such a suck up.

11:40.241 --> 11:43.828
And that's the story
of the man who invented the comma.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.832
Oh, Principal Mullins, what a delight.

11:48.207 --> 11:52.545
Sorry to interrupt,
but Clark here informs me your class

11:53.045 --> 11:55.047
has been pulling one over on me.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.800
She knows!

11:59.885 --> 12:03.597
Oh yes, I know that none
of you have signed up

12:03.681 --> 12:06.183
for mandatory work shifts at the dance.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.104
What did you think I meant, Lawrence?

12:10.688 --> 12:15.359
That shift thing you were talking about.
I'm very ashamed.

12:16.527 --> 12:21.073
Luckily, Clark has volunteered
to assign each of you a task.

12:21.365 --> 12:25.911
I picked a bunch of very fun jobs
to keep you very busy at the dance.

12:26.287 --> 12:30.291
And I'll be watching you every step
of the way.

12:31.959 --> 12:35.546
Thank you, Clark.
How thoughtful of you. Weasel.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.426
Sorry, something in my throat.
I should probably drink some... Weasel.

12:41.844 --> 12:46.182
It's a good thing you're not the band.
Otherwise you'd miss playing the dance.

12:46.765 --> 12:47.766
Clark wins.

12:49.143 --> 12:53.397
It is so nice to see young people take
an interest in discipline.

12:54.523 --> 12:55.524
Clark.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.619
I think Clark's onto us.
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

13:06.827 --> 13:07.953
Oh, we're doing this.

13:09.246 --> 13:12.500
We wanted the kids at our school
to hear our music, and they're going to.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.584
Who's with me?

13:13.792 --> 13:14.793
-Me.
-Me too.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.462
-I'm in.
-Let's rock!

13:16.837 --> 13:18.839
What are you guys talking about?

13:24.345 --> 13:27.848
Okay, listen, it's... it's not that
I don't want to dance with you,

13:28.057 --> 13:32.102
it's just that... I... uh... I...

13:32.978 --> 13:34.772
I'm... I'm going
to be busy faking my own death.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.234
But your mom's still going
to drive me to soccer, right?

13:38.984 --> 13:39.985
Yes.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.112
I'm just trying to figure out what
to say to Kale.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.490
Better think fast. There she is.

13:47.201 --> 13:50.955
Need to drop off the grid?
I know a guy, Kale will never find you.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.082
Wait,
who told you what's going on betwee--

13:53.165 --> 13:55.960
Kid. I'm the school custodian.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.797
No one ever notices me
but I see everything.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.175
Stay strong.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.136
Hey Kale, I need to tell you something.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.723
Freddy, I cannot wait for Saturday night.
I've been journaling about it nonstop.

14:09.807 --> 14:13.435
I now have more pages devoted
to the dance than I do to compost.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.188
Wow. I know how much you love compost.

14:16.397 --> 14:21.277
So much.
Anyway, what did you need to tell me?

14:22.403 --> 14:23.737
I... I need to tell you that...

14:26.365 --> 14:28.492
I'm... I'm really looking forward
to working the ticket table

14:28.576 --> 14:29.577
with you at the dance.

14:29.910 --> 14:33.414
[squealing] I have to get my journal.
The cover has seeds in it

14:33.497 --> 14:36.542
so when I plant it in the ground
my feelings can blossom.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.393
Where's Freddy? Has anyone seen him?

14:55.728 --> 14:58.439
Tonight's the night.
I'm going to tell Freddy I'm the spoon

14:58.564 --> 15:00.691
to his fork in the silverware drawer
of life.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.278
You're not going to say it that way,
are you?

15:05.112 --> 15:08.157
No. Maybe. I don't know.

15:08.657 --> 15:09.742
Hey, sorry I'm late.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.118
I'm so glad you're here.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.954
I made you a boutonniere out
of recycled banana peels.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.165
[sniffing]

15:16.957 --> 15:19.293
-Uh, thanks.
-[gasping] Freddy!

15:22.671 --> 15:24.548
Sure, of course I'll hold these.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.347
Oh, I'd be happy to fill in for you,
Freddy.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.515
You can take my spot
at the beverage table.

15:35.517 --> 15:36.769
Sounds good.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.857
-Mr. Finn.
-[gasping]

15:42.399 --> 15:43.817
Tomika, didn't see you there.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.654
The disguises are set.

15:47.154 --> 15:49.448
Copy that.
We're going to need to be quick.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.283
I haven't seen Clark blink all night.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.203
Of course, we might've been blinking
at the same time.

15:56.538 --> 15:59.375
Tomika? She's good.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.335
How much are the paninis?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.921
-They're free.
-Oh wow, I'm surprised, Zack.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.131
You usually try to make money
on these things.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.468
Dude, this is a dance.
Paninis are for the people.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.763
[gasping] It's hot! Oh, what's in these?

16:13.180 --> 16:14.848
Ghost peppers, hot sauce and jalapenos.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.725
[gasping] Milk, milk, I need milk.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.143
That'll be $7.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.275
The light board is set.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.737
I don't know, Lawrence,
are you sure we can really pull this off?

16:29.279 --> 16:30.656
Pull what off, boys?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.908
Hey,
I sure can't wait to see School of Rock.

16:33.075 --> 16:36.036
Can you? Well, can you?

16:40.124 --> 16:43.293
Hm, seems to be getting quite late.
I wonder where the band is.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.296
You're right, Clark,
they should be playing by now.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.344
DJ Igneous in the house.

16:52.553 --> 16:55.222
Stone cold and ready
to spin those wheels of steel.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.934
Slow your roll, LL Uncool J.

17:00.477 --> 17:03.480
In my experience, all the great bands go
on a little bit late.

17:03.897 --> 17:05.899
They like to build that anticipation.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.318
I, for one,
can't wait to see them take the stage.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.280
Whoever they are,
unless they're a no show.

17:11.822 --> 17:12.865
School of Rock.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.199

17:14.450 --> 17:16.744
School of Rock! School of Rock!

17:16.994 --> 17:20.122
Well if they don't show up soon, Mr. Finn,
we might have a riot on our hands.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.291
And by riot I mean slight naughtiness.

17:22.624 --> 17:23.667

17:42.269 --> 17:46.231
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've all been waiting for.

17:46.857 --> 17:53.322

And here's School of Rock!

Kale is always with him,
it's like she's obsessed with him.

-It's weird.
-Yeah, weird.

19:04.518 --> 19:05.853
But she's not with him now.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.359
I just wanted to let you know that

19:12.484 --> 19:16.071
I have had a huge crush on you
for a long time now

19:16.155 --> 19:17.990
but never had the courage
to tell you how I feel.

I just hope you feel the same way
and that one day you

19:20.367 --> 19:21.535

Okay, all right, I gotta go. Bye.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.503
I did it. Thanks, Tomiks.

Freddy!

19:34.506 --> 19:35.549
Where you been?

19:37.593 --> 19:40.637
I have been looking everywhere for you.
I even called my psychic.

I better cancel him.

19:43.765 --> 19:44.808
Okay, we're good.

I'm glad you found me.

of School of Rock and how they fixed

to play this dance.

School of Rock is none other than...

It can't be. The janitor?

20:17.507 --> 20:19.009
Wait, what, no this isn't right.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.637
No, I prefer the term custodian.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.850
I didn't know the janitor could rock
the skins.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.478
He can't, it's my drum machine.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.523
Nice.

20:34.441 --> 20:39.071
I know it's you, and I'll prove it.
Okay, Clark, you stop that right now.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.865
This is the naughtiness
I was talking about.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.452
But, Principal Mullins,
you don't understand,

20:45.535 --> 20:50.249
these people aren't who they say they are.
I swear, it's a trick. It's a fraud.
