00:10.240 --> 00:12.307
<i>Previously on The Pillars of the Earth...</i>

00:15.712 --> 00:17.646
Who will rule once I am gone?

00:17.647 --> 00:19.915
There's the king's legitimate daughter, Maud,

00:19.916 --> 00:21.116
then there's me.

00:21.117 --> 00:23.018
The shipwreck was convenient.

00:23.019 --> 00:25.888
What happened was ordained
by God. No one survived.

00:26.956 --> 00:28.624
- My Lord!
- The king is unwell!

00:28.625 --> 00:30.859
- The king is dead.
- Long live the king.

00:30.860 --> 00:33.996
We'll raise an army together
and take Stephen by surprise.

00:35.465 --> 00:37.900
So if you make me Prior,

00:37.901 --> 00:39.701
I make you Bishop?

00:39.702 --> 00:41.670
- My name is Ellen.
- Tom.

00:41.671 --> 00:43.071
Tom the Builder.

00:43.072 --> 00:44.439
She's a witch!

00:44.440 --> 00:46.708
There's work at the Bishop's palace.

00:46.709 --> 00:48.644
- It does need repair.
- Hire this man.

00:48.645 --> 00:49.912
Who is that?

00:49.913 --> 00:51.847
The way to my daughter's heart

00:51.848 --> 00:53.115
<i>is through affection.</i>

00:53.116 --> 00:55.150
We will loot Shiring Castle.

00:55.151 --> 00:56.552
We must defend the king!

00:56.553 --> 00:57.753
You're under attack!

01:01.057 --> 01:03.692
Thank you, Earl of Shiring.

02:04.654 --> 02:06.355
Where do you want this then?

02:06.356 --> 02:08.389
- Lay that down here.
- All right.

02:31.113 --> 02:33.414
Steady, Brother Paul.

02:43.492 --> 02:45.593
Afternoon, brother.

02:45.594 --> 02:48.062
I'm looking for the new prior.

02:48.063 --> 02:49.531
In the church.

02:50.866 --> 02:51.866
Don't be long.

02:51.867 --> 02:54.435
I don't want to stay if there's no work.

03:20.963 --> 03:22.864
What's that?

03:24.366 --> 03:26.234
St. Adolphus.

03:26.235 --> 03:28.369
It's his cathedral.

03:32.808 --> 03:34.776
Is that his real head?

03:34.777 --> 03:37.645
The Romans cut it off and threw it in the river.

03:37.646 --> 03:40.615
His headless body pulled
it out and carried it here.

03:40.616 --> 03:44.319
Forgive him, Father. He's...
He's just a curious lad.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.255
Which should be encouraged. How can I help you?

03:47.256 --> 03:50.592
I'm Tom Builder. This is my son, Alfred.

03:50.593 --> 03:53.261
We'd like to repair your church.

03:53.262 --> 03:54.429
Well, I'm Prior Philip.

03:54.430 --> 03:57.565
And I want it repaired, but I can't hire you.

03:57.566 --> 03:59.100
We haven't a shilling.

03:59.101 --> 04:00.602
Sorry.

04:25.794 --> 04:26.828
Martha!

04:28.931 --> 04:30.431
You!

04:33.068 --> 04:34.302
Ah!

04:42.177 --> 04:43.578
Get away from me!

04:43.579 --> 04:45.780
That man nearly killed my daughter!

04:45.781 --> 04:47.282
No!

04:52.187 --> 04:54.122
I saw him that night.

04:54.123 --> 04:56.524
What night? What are you talking about?

04:56.525 --> 04:58.493
The night that your woman died.

05:08.604 --> 05:10.104
He took it.

05:10.105 --> 05:11.873
He took what?

05:51.480 --> 05:54.148
Please, I won't hurt him. I promise.

06:09.732 --> 06:11.466
I'm no good to you, am I?

06:14.336 --> 06:16.371
I'm no good to anyone.

06:39.294 --> 06:41.963
He's better off here than he is with me,

06:41.964 --> 06:43.698
but I don't want to leave.

06:45.734 --> 06:48.803
I left him once before. I can't do that again.

06:50.939 --> 06:53.441
- You have little choice.
- I know that.

06:53.442 --> 06:55.410
You think I don't know that?

07:01.884 --> 07:03.551
I'm useless.

07:03.552 --> 07:06.387
I can't support my family.
I can't stay with my son.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.925
Why can't God give me work just this once?

10:20.582 --> 10:22.416
My God!

10:26.221 --> 10:28.990
There's a fire in the roof!

10:28.991 --> 10:30.992
How could this happen?

10:34.062 --> 10:35.596
What do we do?

10:37.065 --> 10:40.234
St. Adolphus, save your church!

10:46.174 --> 10:48.476
The roof's afire!

10:48.477 --> 10:51.345
- God save us!
- What do we do?

10:55.384 --> 10:57.952
Hurry, hurry!

11:03.058 --> 11:05.660
Quick, quick! The chalices and the vesper!

11:05.661 --> 11:06.761
Quick!

11:10.065 --> 11:11.265
Quick!

11:14.236 --> 11:17.405
Philip! Philip! Come out!

11:17.406 --> 11:19.373
No, the relic! I must save the relic.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.175
Philip!

11:50.105 --> 11:52.206
Philip!

12:10.392 --> 12:13.728
St. Adolphus, save your blessed church!

12:28.710 --> 12:30.878
This is the Devil's work.

12:41.590 --> 12:42.790
Jack!

12:44.693 --> 12:46.660
What happened?

12:49.331 --> 12:50.931
We can stay now.

13:46.955 --> 13:49.290
At least no one died.

13:54.129 --> 13:56.130
I prayed for this last night.

13:58.967 --> 14:00.367
God help me.

14:00.368 --> 14:02.203
It was lightning.

14:03.605 --> 14:05.306
Without a storm?

14:09.311 --> 14:12.379
All my life I've waited for work like this.

14:12.380 --> 14:15.783
Now it's here and they can't afford to pay me.

14:17.652 --> 14:19.553
We could work for free.

14:22.490 --> 14:24.091
They'll give us food and lodging,

14:24.092 --> 14:26.060
and you could stay with your little boy.

14:33.301 --> 14:36.670
It's gone, smashed.

14:36.671 --> 14:38.505
We're finished.

14:38.506 --> 14:41.275
You can't rebuild a cathedral without its relic.

14:41.276 --> 14:44.245
A skull's a skull, Philip.
We don't even know it was his.

14:44.246 --> 14:45.546
What about the miracles?

14:45.547 --> 14:48.115
I've been praying to that skull for years

14:48.116 --> 14:51.485
to save my poor sister from the street. Useless!

14:51.486 --> 14:53.654
It does take belief, too.

14:53.655 --> 14:57.324
Yes, but what if people
believe another skull is his?

14:57.325 --> 14:59.960
One from the ossuary. There's thousands.

14:59.961 --> 15:03.998
And who's to say the monk whose
head we choose isn't a saint?

15:03.999 --> 15:05.666
Because that would be a lie!

15:05.667 --> 15:08.969
Not a lie, a... a leavening,

15:08.970 --> 15:11.038
a means to an end.

15:11.039 --> 15:14.441
And the end is God's glory.

15:53.214 --> 15:55.616
Well, at least the crypt was spared.

15:55.617 --> 15:58.419
You can use it for services, can't you?

15:58.420 --> 16:01.255
Until the new church is roofed.

16:01.256 --> 16:04.058
What makes you think
there'll even be a new church?

16:05.226 --> 16:06.961
Because I will build it.

16:06.962 --> 16:10.731
You house us, you feed us,
and I will defer payment.

16:10.732 --> 16:12.933
This may be the Devil's work,

16:12.934 --> 16:15.836
but it was God that sent you a master builder.

16:49.738 --> 16:51.905
<i>My dear bishop:</i>

16:51.906 --> 16:55.075
<i>Undoubtedly, you have
heard of our misfortune.</i>

16:55.076 --> 16:57.778
<i>But God has blessed us
with a rough-handed angel</i>

16:57.779 --> 16:59.680
<i>to help us through this crisis.</i>

16:59.681 --> 17:01.815
Tom Builder is his name.

17:01.816 --> 17:05.352
<i>And he is determined to
give us a new cathedral.</i>

17:36.351 --> 17:39.486
There is much work to be
done and workmen to be hired.

17:39.487 --> 17:42.189
<i>Of course, this brings
up the question of money.</i>

17:42.190 --> 17:44.992
I don't wish to burden you
as you begin your office,

17:44.993 --> 17:46.660
<i>but perhaps, with your permission,</i>

17:46.661 --> 17:48.228
I could approach our king

17:48.229 --> 17:51.398
<i>and ask his favour in this trying time.</i>

17:51.399 --> 17:54.601
The plans for the expansion
of the palace, Your Eminence.

17:54.602 --> 17:57.538
We are repairing the old buildings and the chapel.

17:57.539 --> 18:00.808
And we're adding an entire new wing over here.

18:12.353 --> 18:14.288
Did you scratch it?

18:14.289 --> 18:15.823
Yeah.

18:15.824 --> 18:19.293
You shouldn't wear it picking up heavy rocks.

18:22.363 --> 18:24.498
Is it worth a lot of money?

18:26.468 --> 18:30.104
Hey, Jack, give it here.
I'll put it in a safe place.

18:30.105 --> 18:31.839
Jack...

18:31.840 --> 18:34.408
May I speak to you for a moment?

18:42.817 --> 18:45.752
I want you to make a statue of St. Adolphus.

18:49.124 --> 18:50.190
Me?

18:51.893 --> 18:53.560
I've never worked in stone.

18:53.561 --> 18:54.928
That's not true.

18:54.929 --> 18:56.964
I saw the carvings you did in the cave.

18:56.965 --> 18:58.432
I think you'll manage.

18:58.433 --> 19:00.934
I wouldn't know where to start.

19:00.935 --> 19:02.136
Take your time.

19:04.873 --> 19:05.873
Experiment.

19:07.609 --> 19:08.909
Listen.

19:08.910 --> 19:11.545
- To what?
- To the stone.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.814
You're a distraction, you are.

19:47.815 --> 19:51.685
I've seen the monks watching you while they work.

19:51.686 --> 19:54.221
They don't know what to make of you.

19:56.591 --> 19:58.859
Oh, I think they do, Tom Builder.

20:00.461 --> 20:02.462
Are you jealous?

20:05.466 --> 20:07.234
No, I'm not jealous.

22:05.353 --> 22:08.388
We'll have a wooden ceiling, like the old church.

22:08.389 --> 22:10.791
I'd prefer it in stone, but it's far too heavy.

22:10.792 --> 22:13.827
Also, it's hard to find long pieces of timber,

22:13.828 --> 22:16.963
so the nave will have to be only 32-feet wide.

22:16.964 --> 22:20.033
But it'll be high. It'll be very high.

22:20.034 --> 22:22.502
How will the walls support the weight?

22:22.503 --> 22:24.204
Well, have a look at this.

22:28.109 --> 22:30.877
Pointed arches? I've never seen such a thing.

22:30.878 --> 22:32.679
It'll bear the weight better.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.081
With the buttresses,

22:34.082 --> 22:36.183
it will allow the windows to be tall.

22:36.184 --> 22:38.652
Tall enough to let in the light.

22:38.653 --> 22:40.187
A cathedral...

22:44.792 --> 22:46.360
it's God's anteroom.

22:46.361 --> 22:49.196
It's halfway to heaven.

22:50.198 --> 22:51.531
And the light...

22:53.267 --> 22:55.001
The light is everything.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.717
How long will this take?

23:10.718 --> 23:13.286
It depends how many people you employ.

23:13.287 --> 23:15.589
But if you were to hire 30 masons

23:15.590 --> 23:18.158
with enough labourers, carpenters and smiths

23:18.159 --> 23:19.259
to service them,

23:19.260 --> 23:20.327
that's 15 years.

23:21.462 --> 23:23.697
- Have you done this before?
- No.

23:23.698 --> 23:27.467
- How do you know it'll work?
- It'll work.

23:36.878 --> 23:38.345
What do you think?

23:44.051 --> 23:46.052
I think it's extraordinary.

23:48.289 --> 23:49.956
It's from Bishop Waleran, prior.

23:49.957 --> 23:52.125
He wants me to meet him at Shiring Castle

23:52.126 --> 23:54.327
on my way to see the king.

23:54.328 --> 23:55.729
I don't know why.

23:57.598 --> 23:59.766
Uh, I shouldn't be long, Remigius,

23:59.767 --> 24:03.003
but until I return, as subprior, you're in charge.

24:03.004 --> 24:04.070
Safe journeys.

24:13.548 --> 24:14.748
Where's my ring?

24:14.749 --> 24:18.051
Jack! Jack!

24:18.052 --> 24:21.188
I hung it around my neck,
and you stole it at night!

24:21.189 --> 24:23.523
Why should you care? You said it was worthless!

24:23.524 --> 24:27.594
- Maybe it fell off at night.
- I looked everywhere.

24:27.595 --> 24:29.763
- What's wrong?
- He took my ring!

24:29.764 --> 24:31.631
I don't want his bloody ring!

24:31.632 --> 24:33.066
Where is it?

24:33.067 --> 24:37.070
Look at me, boy! Hey!

24:37.071 --> 24:38.572
You can't witch me!

24:40.241 --> 24:43.043
You killed my ma and you stole my da,

24:43.044 --> 24:45.645
but you can't work your charms on me!

25:19.213 --> 25:20.914
Is anybody here?

25:30.658 --> 25:33.927
- Who are you?
- Philip, Prior of Kingsbridge.

25:33.928 --> 25:35.629
What is your business here?

25:35.630 --> 25:38.965
I've come to see the bishop,
on my way to the king.

25:38.966 --> 25:40.734
Let him go, Matthew.

25:40.735 --> 25:43.003
I'm Aliena, daughter of the earl.

25:43.004 --> 25:44.571
I saw you at the harvest service.

25:44.572 --> 25:45.906
My Lady.

25:45.907 --> 25:48.542
And I'm Richard, his son and heir.

25:50.077 --> 25:51.845
Welcome to Shiring Castle.

25:52.914 --> 25:54.948
Does anyone know you're here?

25:54.949 --> 25:56.116
Why should they?

25:56.117 --> 25:57.751
Have you seen our father?

25:57.752 --> 25:59.786
I hear he's in Winchester's prison.

25:59.787 --> 26:01.788
He's not a traitor, you know.

26:01.789 --> 26:03.657
He loves his kingdom as much as anyone.

26:03.658 --> 26:05.292
Once I learn who libelled him,

26:05.293 --> 26:08.161
I'll have the sheriff give
the brute a public hanging.

26:12.934 --> 26:15.168
How did you escape, My Lady?

26:16.504 --> 26:18.171
Show him, Richard.

26:20.608 --> 26:23.810
It's a secret passage. Would you like to see it?

26:27.748 --> 26:29.249
Uh, no, thank you.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.017
- You're going to see the king?
- Yes.

26:31.018 --> 26:33.320
You must demand our father's release

26:33.321 --> 26:34.921
and get our castle back.

26:34.922 --> 26:37.624
I don't think that will be possible, My Lady.

26:40.861 --> 26:43.530
- Hello, Philip.
- Good morning, my Lord Bishop.

26:45.166 --> 26:48.401
You really want to rebuild your church, hmm?

26:48.402 --> 26:49.769
Yes, Father, I do.

26:51.372 --> 26:54.841
The cathedral is God's
shadow over history, Father.

26:54.842 --> 26:55.976
We...

26:55.977 --> 26:57.711
We live in a world

26:57.712 --> 26:59.879
that is striving for order,

26:59.880 --> 27:01.748
which is art, which is learning,

27:01.749 --> 27:03.883
which is people creating something

27:03.884 --> 27:07.120
that will bring God's heart into their community,

27:07.121 --> 27:09.856
that will survive wars and famine,

27:09.857 --> 27:11.992
that will survive history.

27:13.594 --> 27:15.328
I thought I was ambitious.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.731
- Father, I only want...
- Philip, Philip!

27:17.732 --> 27:19.466
Look around you.

27:19.467 --> 27:22.836
This is the smallest earldom in the kingdom,

27:22.837 --> 27:25.438
but it has a huge quarry which produces

27:25.439 --> 27:29.175
first-class limestone, and
its forests, good timber.

27:30.544 --> 27:33.480
If you had this land, you
could rebuild your church.

27:33.481 --> 27:36.049
Why would the king give me land instead of money?

27:36.050 --> 27:39.052
You unmasked the traitor. Bartholomew confessed.

27:39.053 --> 27:41.254
Maud and Gloucester ran away to France.

27:41.255 --> 27:43.923
Stephen owes you his crown.

27:43.924 --> 27:46.126
Think about it.

27:49.163 --> 27:51.498
<i>Why did Waleran meet
the Prior of Kingsbridge</i>

27:51.499 --> 27:52.999
in Shiring Castle?

27:54.802 --> 27:58.004
It's our land, isn't it? He
should have asked permission.

27:58.005 --> 28:01.241
Why do you say it's our land? You're not earl yet.

28:01.242 --> 28:02.676
It's a mere formality.

28:04.178 --> 28:06.880
The king will give me the title within the month.

28:06.881 --> 28:08.281
He owes it to me.

28:08.282 --> 28:12.152
Well then, I think we should
remind the king of what he owes.

28:12.153 --> 28:14.254
And I think we should do it soon.

28:19.026 --> 28:21.327
She is a witch.

28:21.328 --> 28:23.229
I saw her.

28:23.230 --> 28:26.066
Doing what? Say it.

28:26.067 --> 28:28.568
Making a potion out of dead frogs.

28:28.569 --> 28:31.004
She gave it to my ma and it killed her.

28:31.005 --> 28:32.605
Then she bewitched my da

28:32.606 --> 28:35.408
and made love to him on my mother's grave.

28:35.409 --> 28:38.078
You swear to that? On your soul?

28:39.814 --> 28:41.314
Yes.

28:41.315 --> 28:43.516
Brothers, the boy speaks true.

28:43.517 --> 28:47.187
I knew this woman years
ago, when I first came here.

28:47.188 --> 28:51.491
She was condemned for witchcraft
and a price put on her head.

28:51.492 --> 28:53.793
She disappeared with her son,

28:53.794 --> 28:57.430
and the people said the Devil had taken them home.

28:57.431 --> 28:59.833
It was she who started the fire.

28:59.834 --> 29:01.134
She must burn.

29:09.610 --> 29:11.177
Leave the talking to me.

29:11.178 --> 29:14.280
If the king does ask you
a question, answer plainly.

29:14.281 --> 29:15.882
Whatever you do, don't beg.

29:15.883 --> 29:17.183
Make room!

29:17.184 --> 29:19.519
Here comes the traitor, Bartholomew!

29:19.520 --> 29:22.422
- Hey! Shame on you!
- Traitor!

29:24.525 --> 29:27.060
What the devil are they doing here?

29:27.061 --> 29:29.796
Shame on you!

29:29.797 --> 29:32.265
Yeah! String him up!

29:32.266 --> 29:33.600
My Lord Bishop.

29:33.601 --> 29:36.202
It's been a long time since our paths crossed.

29:36.203 --> 29:39.873
Welcome to Winchester. Who's this?

29:39.874 --> 29:43.510
Philip, Prior of Kingsbridge, Your Majesty.

29:43.511 --> 29:46.646
You seem worried. Why?

29:46.647 --> 29:48.782
I don't have a clean robe to wear.

29:50.384 --> 29:54.020
Well, I like a monk to look like a monk.

29:55.890 --> 29:59.025
I heard about your fire.
How soon will you rebuild?

29:59.026 --> 30:01.427
As soon as I find the money, Sire.

30:01.428 --> 30:03.730
I hope you haven't come to beg for it.

30:03.731 --> 30:04.931
We're paupers here.

30:07.301 --> 30:10.036
I think I have found a way to rebuild

30:10.037 --> 30:13.473
without further diminishing
your coffers, Your Majesty.

30:13.474 --> 30:18.211
Give Shiring and all its land
to the diocese of Kingsbridge,

30:18.212 --> 30:20.246
and we'll give you a new church.

30:20.247 --> 30:21.815
What a clever idea.

30:21.816 --> 30:25.485
Unfortunately, I gave Shiring to Percy Hamleigh

30:25.486 --> 30:27.187
less than an hour ago.

30:28.522 --> 30:30.290
Well, it's not official.

30:30.291 --> 30:31.324
Well, not yet.

30:33.027 --> 30:35.895
Present a strong argument for your case,

30:35.896 --> 30:37.564
and I might reconsider.

30:39.099 --> 30:41.067
We could rename the church after

30:41.068 --> 30:43.803
a saint of your choosing, Your Majesty.

30:43.804 --> 30:45.305
St. Stephen, perhaps?

30:45.306 --> 30:49.843
Or St. Elmo, the patron
saint of sailors lost at sea.

30:55.416 --> 30:59.018
Come back tomorrow. You'll have my answer then.

31:12.766 --> 31:14.300
You're working hard.

31:14.301 --> 31:17.237
I thought you might be thirsty, Tom Builder.

31:17.238 --> 31:18.872
Oh, thank you.

31:22.042 --> 31:23.610
What are they staring at?

31:23.611 --> 31:26.045
Their turn to be jealous.

31:38.692 --> 31:41.794
You need to send her away.

31:41.795 --> 31:44.464
- What's that?
- Remigius says she's a witch.

31:44.465 --> 31:46.299
He sent a letter to the bishop.

31:46.300 --> 31:48.101
Why'd he do that? It's gossip.

31:48.102 --> 31:50.536
It's worse. It's malicious and dangerous!

31:50.537 --> 31:52.372
He has a witness.

32:08.589 --> 32:12.892
His Majesty will now see Lord Harefield

32:12.893 --> 32:14.494
and the Bishop of Lancaster.

32:16.063 --> 32:19.399
Your Eminence, I'm told you're
seeking an emissary to Rome.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.734
I would be happy to volunteer.

32:21.735 --> 32:25.071
You are too new to the post, my good bishop.

32:25.072 --> 32:28.241
Rome demands a more experienced politician.

32:28.242 --> 32:30.743
Perhaps a visit to my palace would convince you.

32:30.744 --> 32:33.579
I have worked changes to the diocese.

32:33.580 --> 32:37.450
It's hardly a palace, when I visited years ago.

32:37.451 --> 32:40.486
More like a ruin with a roof.

32:40.487 --> 32:41.921
Excuse me.

32:43.791 --> 32:45.692
Not a ruin for long.

32:47.227 --> 32:49.829
How could you be so stupid?

32:49.830 --> 32:51.464
Waleran is using you

32:51.465 --> 32:54.300
and your church to get the earldom for himself.

32:54.301 --> 32:56.669
- That's a lie.
- Is it?

32:56.670 --> 32:58.771
Then why did he tell the king

32:58.772 --> 33:02.241
to give Shiring to the diocese and not the priory?

33:02.242 --> 33:05.611
It was a slip of the tongue.
Besides, he only means...

33:05.612 --> 33:07.981
That he will control the purse strings.

33:07.982 --> 33:10.850
And believe me, monk, a church is not where

33:10.851 --> 33:12.785
he wants to spend his gold.

33:12.786 --> 33:16.723
He's hired this man to
triple the size of his palace.

33:16.724 --> 33:18.091
Show him.

33:28.335 --> 33:30.136
He'll need Shiring's forests

33:30.137 --> 33:32.638
and quarry to fulfill this design.

33:33.674 --> 33:36.209
Your good bishop doesn't care a whit

33:36.210 --> 33:38.111
for your precious cathedral.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.681
Thank you, master builder.

33:41.682 --> 33:43.282
William...

33:50.124 --> 33:51.991
Side with us, monk.

33:51.992 --> 33:53.893
We will make a generous contribution

33:53.894 --> 33:54.994
to your building fund.

33:58.665 --> 34:00.133
No.

34:00.134 --> 34:02.502
We go to the king instead

34:02.503 --> 34:04.070
and divide the earldom equally,

34:04.071 --> 34:05.738
with you getting the better half.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.740
What do you mean?

34:07.741 --> 34:10.376
What's more valuable, arable land or forest?

34:10.377 --> 34:13.246
- Arable land.
- Then I'll have the forest.

34:13.246 --> 34:15.380
- I hunt.
- I just want the timber.

34:15.382 --> 34:16.815
Which would you prefer?

34:16.817 --> 34:19.652
The income from the markets or the quarry?

34:19.652 --> 34:21.353
What if I said the quarry?

34:22.456 --> 34:24.322
You won't, though, will you?

34:25.359 --> 34:27.393
And when Waleran objects?

34:27.393 --> 34:29.495
He told the king that he needs Shiring

34:29.496 --> 34:30.897
to finance the cathedral.

34:30.898 --> 34:32.965
How can he object on the grounds

34:32.966 --> 34:35.534
that he wants to build his new castle instead?

34:35.536 --> 34:37.637
Hmm... You're a keener politician

34:37.638 --> 34:39.639
than I gave you credit for.

34:39.639 --> 34:43.443
Politics is a bargain between beggars, My Lady.

34:43.444 --> 34:46.779
Oh! And I have... I have one other request.

34:46.780 --> 34:49.449
I must have protection for the lady Aliena

34:49.449 --> 34:50.683
and her brother Richard.

34:50.684 --> 34:52.150
You've seen them?

34:52.152 --> 34:54.587
They're hiding in the castle,
starving and penniless.

34:55.722 --> 34:57.757
They need to be taken care of.

34:57.758 --> 34:59.025
Oh, but of course.

35:00.294 --> 35:01.661
We'll see to that.

35:02.663 --> 35:04.330
Your Eminence.

35:07.067 --> 35:10.536
<i>Lord Bishop, we have a witch among us.</i>

35:10.537 --> 35:14.073
<i>A woman, as you know, long
wanted in these parts.</i>

35:14.074 --> 35:16.075
A witness has come forward.

35:16.076 --> 35:17.410
Why'd you say that?

35:18.812 --> 35:21.547
Answer me! Why'd you say that?

35:21.548 --> 35:25.084
She's been good to me! Better than I deserve.

35:25.085 --> 35:27.320
Don't make me choose between you, boy.

35:27.321 --> 35:30.389
Brother Remigius has been claiming you're a witch.

35:30.390 --> 35:33.392
He's got Alfred here to give proof to the lie.

35:34.661 --> 35:36.462
It's not a lie.

35:36.463 --> 35:37.797
Not entirely.

35:39.133 --> 35:41.701
See that this woman is arrested immediately

35:41.702 --> 35:44.937
and that she speaks to no one.

35:55.282 --> 35:57.250
Yah! Yah!

35:59.653 --> 36:01.621
Jack's father had a secret.

36:03.624 --> 36:06.058
<i>Something to do with a ring he had.</i>

36:08.128 --> 36:10.363
He wouldn't tell me what it was.

36:10.364 --> 36:14.233
He wanted to see the king,
to tell him what he knew.

36:14.234 --> 36:17.336
But I was only a naive novice. How could I help?

36:17.337 --> 36:21.574
I hid him in a barn on our convent property,

36:21.575 --> 36:26.078
where he asked me for a quill,
paper, sealing wax and ink.

36:26.079 --> 36:28.381
<i>I then went to my priest confessor.</i>

36:30.017 --> 36:33.186
<i>I found him on the beach, Father.</i>

36:33.187 --> 36:35.755
He needs your help, your support.

36:37.291 --> 36:40.426
He has a secret he will tell no one but the king.

36:40.427 --> 36:43.596
<i>The next day, he was taken from the barn</i>

36:43.597 --> 36:47.266
and accused of stealing the
Kingsbridge Priory's chalice.

36:48.435 --> 36:51.370
He was tortured, confessed...

36:54.474 --> 36:56.342
and his tongue was cut out.

36:56.343 --> 37:00.880
He was held for nearly 3 years
before he was brought to trial.

37:00.881 --> 37:05.218
The prior whose chalice was
stolen testified against him.

37:05.219 --> 37:08.754
<i>The Lord of the District
served as his judge,</i>

37:08.755 --> 37:11.357
and my priest confessor passed sentence.

37:14.595 --> 37:15.928
Then...

37:17.231 --> 37:19.131
a remarkable thing happened.

37:51.164 --> 37:54.300
I curse you, all 3 of you!

37:54.301 --> 37:55.868
Stay back!

37:55.869 --> 37:59.305
Touch me and you'll be dead by morning.

37:59.306 --> 38:02.975
Your church, dear Prior, shall burn to the ground.

38:02.976 --> 38:07.046
Your children, My Lord, shall die on the gallows.

38:08.382 --> 38:10.149
And you, good Father,

38:10.150 --> 38:12.318
the confessor whom I trusted,

38:12.319 --> 38:17.023
you shall one day climb very high, only to fall.

38:17.024 --> 38:18.858
Only to fall.

38:25.532 --> 38:27.967
What was the secret they didn't want him to tell?

38:27.968 --> 38:31.437
I never learned. I found his ring.

38:31.438 --> 38:34.707
The one Jack wore, until it was stolen,

38:34.708 --> 38:36.475
but no paper.

38:36.476 --> 38:39.812
So, yes, I'm a wanted woman, Tom.

38:39.813 --> 38:41.647
I'll leave in the morning. No argument.

38:41.648 --> 38:42.848
You're staying here.

38:42.849 --> 38:44.617
And you are staying with them.

38:47.254 --> 38:49.588
I've made the decision.

38:49.589 --> 38:51.791
My loyal subject, Percy Hamleigh,

38:51.792 --> 38:53.392
is the Earl of Shiring.

38:53.393 --> 38:54.860
He shall have the castle

38:54.861 --> 38:58.197
and all arable lands and low-lying pastures.

38:58.198 --> 39:01.934
All other farmlands, I give to...

39:03.337 --> 39:05.137
the Priory of Kingsbridge

39:05.138 --> 39:07.840
for the building of the new cathedral.

39:12.045 --> 39:14.580
- And the quarry?
- Goes to the Hamleighs.

39:14.581 --> 39:16.882
But you may take what stones you need.

39:16.883 --> 39:18.784
But... but that's not...

39:18.785 --> 39:20.653
Enough.

39:20.654 --> 39:22.922
My decision stands.

39:33.333 --> 39:36.469
I don't take kindly to priests who steal.

39:36.470 --> 39:40.206
And God doesn't take kindly to bishops who lie.

39:40.207 --> 39:44.910
I swear by all that's holy,
you'll never build your church.

39:48.615 --> 39:51.584
Open the gates, in the bishop's name!

39:57.758 --> 40:01.026
I'll show you where the witch is. Follow me.

40:20.514 --> 40:23.582
No! No!

40:49.009 --> 40:51.243
1, 2, 3, 4,

40:51.244 --> 40:55.581
5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

40:56.917 --> 40:59.218
Allie?

41:10.964 --> 41:12.398
I'm over here!

41:45.999 --> 41:47.333
Allie!

41:49.603 --> 41:50.936
No!

41:53.073 --> 41:55.741
No! No!

41:58.345 --> 42:00.880
No, please! Don't hurt her!

42:00.881 --> 42:02.348
Let me go!

42:08.255 --> 42:10.923
Lie still or the boy dies.

42:10.924 --> 42:12.157
Cut off his ear, Walter!

42:12.158 --> 42:14.627
No!

42:27.674 --> 42:29.742
You see, bitch?

42:29.743 --> 42:32.611
I'm a better man than you deserve.

43:34.941 --> 43:36.308
Shhh! Shhh!

43:38.278 --> 43:40.279
Get away from the horse!

43:44.551 --> 43:46.352
Fucking bitch! Come here.

43:46.353 --> 43:48.320
Looks like it's your lucky night.

43:48.321 --> 43:49.888
Ah!

43:53.593 --> 43:56.428
Look what you've done to me! Kill him.

43:56.429 --> 43:58.530
- You fucking bitch!
- Shut him up.

43:58.531 --> 44:00.099
How?

44:00.100 --> 44:02.334
I don't know how. Just cut off his head!

44:03.603 --> 44:05.504
Kill him before anyone can hear.

44:05.505 --> 44:06.839
Allie, please.

44:06.840 --> 44:08.841
You have to do this, Richard.

44:08.842 --> 44:10.776
Ah! Don't!

44:28.628 --> 44:30.129
Where is the woman?

44:30.130 --> 44:32.464
Locked away, Your Eminence. As you wished.

44:32.465 --> 44:34.900
Good. Prepare for a trial this evening.

44:34.901 --> 44:36.835
We don't have a witness anymore.

44:36.836 --> 44:39.471
The boy will not testify.

44:40.507 --> 44:41.840
I'll be the witness.

44:41.841 --> 44:44.209
I want this thing ended quickly.

44:44.210 --> 44:46.845
A woman in a monastery is like a mare in heat,

44:46.846 --> 44:49.081
even a gelding would misbehave in her presence.

44:50.250 --> 44:51.984
Monks may be celibate,

44:51.985 --> 44:54.353
but they can still smell cunt.

45:04.497 --> 45:05.798
Halt, woman!

45:05.799 --> 45:07.332
You too, boy.

45:07.333 --> 45:09.068
Richard, listen to me.

45:09.069 --> 45:11.570
You mustn't tell Father what happened.

45:11.571 --> 45:13.172
I'll tell the king then.

45:13.173 --> 45:14.873
He'll have both their heads.

45:14.874 --> 45:17.076
No. You mustn't tell anyone, ever.

45:21.448 --> 45:22.815
Aliena?

45:22.816 --> 45:24.683
Father.

45:24.684 --> 45:26.118
Ellen's been arrested.

45:26.119 --> 45:28.053
I received word. Where is she?

45:28.054 --> 45:29.354
In a basement cell.

45:29.355 --> 45:31.724
They won't let anyone see her except...

45:31.725 --> 45:33.892
- Where is Tom?
- In his work shed.

45:33.893 --> 45:35.928
Waleran has us building a pyre.

45:35.929 --> 45:39.231
We've come to ask the king if he will grant mercy.

45:39.232 --> 45:41.500
He will do nothing for me.

45:41.501 --> 45:45.904
Listen, I hid 50 gold coins

45:45.905 --> 45:48.240
in a belt under my shirt.

45:48.241 --> 45:51.143
They're being held for you in safekeeping

45:51.144 --> 45:53.746
by a priest who heard my confession.

45:53.747 --> 45:55.647
We can use it to buy your freedom.

45:56.683 --> 46:00.853
My freedom... is not for sale.

46:02.689 --> 46:04.723
Well, is it true? Is she a witch?

46:04.724 --> 46:06.258
No.

46:06.259 --> 46:09.228
I swear by all that's holy.

46:09.229 --> 46:12.664
She's not the mother of your
children, though, is she?

46:12.665 --> 46:14.032
No.

46:14.033 --> 46:16.168
Are you living in sin?

46:18.204 --> 46:20.239
You can't burn her for that.

46:25.378 --> 46:29.047
If I save her, you must marry her.

46:29.048 --> 46:31.850
- I will.
- Bring her back to the Church.

46:31.851 --> 46:33.919
That's her decision. It's not mine.

46:33.920 --> 46:37.055
- It's my condition.
- Whatever. Whatever you say.

46:39.559 --> 46:42.261
Beware of the witch, brother.

46:45.832 --> 46:48.167
I ain't supposed to talk to you.

46:48.168 --> 46:51.970
But Prior Philip told me to let
you hold the baby one last time.

46:51.971 --> 46:53.605
Be careful of his bottom, though.

46:53.606 --> 46:55.040
He's carrying a bit of a load.

47:15.195 --> 47:18.096
This woman here stands accused

47:18.097 --> 47:21.133
of consorting with the Devil.

47:21.134 --> 47:24.436
The bishop himself bears witness against her.

47:24.437 --> 47:27.406
Do you want to say anything
before we pass sentence?

47:38.017 --> 47:41.053
- Oh! Such witchcraft!
- She's the Devil!

47:53.266 --> 47:55.334
Oh!

47:55.335 --> 47:57.436
Avert your eyes from the witch.

48:01.074 --> 48:03.408
Piss on you, Lord Bishop!

48:04.777 --> 48:07.346
Don't touch her! Let the Devil pass out of here.

48:07.347 --> 48:09.348
Your Eminence!

48:23.630 --> 48:25.364
There she is! Yah!

48:41.014 --> 48:42.581
Was she a virgin?

48:42.582 --> 48:43.849
Oh yes.

48:44.851 --> 48:47.286
And did she struggle?

48:50.223 --> 48:51.356
Frightfully.

48:54.127 --> 48:55.661
And you showed her

48:55.662 --> 48:58.397
what a fine young man you
are down there, didn't you?

49:03.503 --> 49:05.404
Father...

49:05.405 --> 49:08.640
just as Maud and Gloucester are raising an army

49:08.641 --> 49:09.975
to reclaim the throne,

49:09.976 --> 49:12.444
so to will I claim back
what is mine, what is ours.

49:14.380 --> 49:17.883
I swear by Jesus Christ and all His saints

49:17.884 --> 49:22.587
that I will not rest until
Richard is the Earl of Shiring

49:22.588 --> 49:25.857
and lord of the land that you once ruled.

49:30.596 --> 49:32.731
Do I have your blessing in this?

49:35.168 --> 49:38.170
Always... and forever.

49:40.039 --> 49:41.473
I swear...

49:43.209 --> 49:46.011
no matter where your affections fly,

49:46.012 --> 49:48.647
you shall always rule my heart,

49:49.983 --> 49:51.249
sweet William.

50:50.777 --> 50:52.244
We've begun.
