00:09.843 --> 00:14.078
The global threat caused
by the skyrocketing demand
for meat.

00:14.181 --> 00:18.099
Our focus is on
making the meat
as cheap as possible.

00:18.218 --> 00:21.720
That's where we often have
environmental catastrophes.

00:27.311 --> 00:31.730
Then the crisis
that humanity is facing
in our global water supply.

00:31.782 --> 00:35.266
Something's happening.
This drought is worse than
anything you've ever seen.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.619
In the history
of farming here in
the san joaquin valley, yes.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.872
Those red spots represent
groundwater depletion.

00:40.907 --> 00:43.041
It's happening
all over the world.

00:54.921 --> 00:57.756
Hands up! Don't shoot!
Hands up!

01:05.432 --> 01:09.017
The world health organization
recently classified
processed meats

01:09.102 --> 01:12.103
In the same cancer causing
group one carcinogens

01:12.189 --> 01:16.474
As tobacco, diesel exhaust,
and asbestos.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.661
But some scientists fear that
our global addiction to meat,

01:19.780 --> 01:22.814
Might pose an even
greater threat.

01:36.596 --> 01:41.182
So this is the very first step
of getting the stem cells
out of a piece of muscle.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.351
If we just take
a very small piece of it,

01:43.470 --> 01:46.137
In a couple of days, those
stem cells will crawl out.

01:46.223 --> 01:48.606
Once we have sufficient
number of cells,

01:48.692 --> 01:52.861
We will provide
the conditions for them
to grow into a tissue.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.179
So, what is it that you're
actually doing here
in this lab?

01:55.282 --> 01:57.615
We are creating hamburgers
from stem cells.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.567
<i>Dr. Mark post, is famous</i>

01:59.653 --> 02:03.538
<i>For his work in creating</i>
<i>the first synthetic burger.</i>

02:03.623 --> 02:05.323
And how long does that
whole process take,

02:05.409 --> 02:08.076
To turn these tiny little
stem cells into meat?

02:08.161 --> 02:11.246
About seven weeks.
So, that's much faster
than a cow.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.881
Much, much faster than a cow.

02:12.999 --> 02:15.383
So, this is
the new mcdonald's?
Yes.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.585
Can i try it?
No.

02:17.671 --> 02:22.841
<i>Mark's first burger cost him</i>
<i>more than $325,000 to make.</i>

02:22.926 --> 02:28.313
This will be the first time
a burger made with cultured
beef has been cooked.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.265
It's close to meat.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.383
There's quite
some intense taste.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.935
<i>But mark is hopeful</i>

02:34.020 --> 02:36.404
<i>He can produce them cheaper</i>
<i>and on a larger scale.</i>

02:36.523 --> 02:39.357
What are your biggest reasons
for wanting to make

02:39.409 --> 02:41.359
This sort of synthetic meat
in the first place?

02:41.445 --> 02:42.944
The demand for meat
is going to increase,

02:43.029 --> 02:45.914
And there's no way
with the current
livestock production method

02:46.032 --> 02:47.231
That you can match
that demand.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.952
So that will put a lot
of pressure on food security.

02:51.037 --> 02:55.089
If we would all say,
"let's refrain from eating
meat five days a week,"

02:55.208 --> 02:58.460
It would work out fine,
but we're not doing that.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.628
<i>We're actually doing</i>
<i>the polar opposite.</i>

03:00.714 --> 03:04.599
<i>Global meat production has</i>
<i>quadrupled since the 1960s,</i>

03:04.718 --> 03:07.852
<i>And by 2050 it will increase</i>
<i>by half again.</i>

03:10.557 --> 03:15.193
<i>One country that's capitalized</i>
<i>on that explosive growth</i>
<i>is brazil,</i>

03:15.278 --> 03:17.094
<i>Which is now behind</i>
<i>only the us</i>

03:17.197 --> 03:20.315
<i>For title of largest</i>
<i>beef producer in the world.</i>

03:20.400 --> 03:22.116
There's a hell of a lot
of resources

03:22.235 --> 03:25.436
That go into a feedlot
like this-- water, energy.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.323
Absolutely everything is done
for maximum efficiency,

03:28.408 --> 03:30.492
And that means that each one
of these cattle gets to eat

03:30.577 --> 03:32.109
About 48 pounds
every single day.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.496
<i>Pedro merola,</i>
<i>owner of the feedlot,</i>

03:34.581 --> 03:36.280
<i>Explained to us</i>
<i>how it works.</i>

03:47.761 --> 03:50.562
Oh, wow, look at these
skinny little runts.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.598
These guys are the cattle
that have just arrived?

03:58.438 --> 04:00.688
These are the ones that are
about to go for slaughter?

04:02.359 --> 04:06.027
Wow, look at the difference
in size that three months
can make.

04:06.112 --> 04:08.580
You've fed these guys
pretty damn well.

04:08.665 --> 04:12.917
<i>Feeding all these cattle is</i>
<i>already a massive operation.</i>

04:13.003 --> 04:17.839
<i>And pedro is planning on</i>
<i>doubling his production just</i>
<i>to keep up with global demand.</i>

04:17.923 --> 04:19.791
So, what is this
that they're mixing up here?

04:21.962 --> 04:24.262
And how much feed do the cows
eat every day?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.716
450 tons a day? Wow.

04:28.802 --> 04:34.889
<i>This system is called a</i>
<i>"concentrated animal feeding</i>
<i>operation," or cafo.</i>

04:34.975 --> 04:40.812
<i>This cafo is designed to make</i>
<i>these cattle gain nearly 400</i>
<i>pounds in just 90 days.</i>

04:40.897 --> 04:43.364
These cattle have been
cooped up in their pens,

04:43.483 --> 04:45.182
But now they've finally
reached the end of the road.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.185
They're just
being herded towards
the final weighing station

04:48.288 --> 04:51.906
Before heading out to one
of several slaughterhouses
across the country.

05:12.429 --> 05:14.646
So, how many cattle
have you got in today?

05:29.529 --> 05:32.229
Everything's done
on such a mass scale.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.950
The amount of cattle that
they're processing is crazy.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.785
It's one every 30 seconds.

05:45.762 --> 05:46.844
Fuck.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.316
<i>And business is expected</i>
<i>to get even better.</i>

06:59.419 --> 07:03.621
<i>Brazil is about to be allowed</i>
<i>to export fresh beef</i>
<i>directly to the us.</i>

07:10.797 --> 07:13.664
<i>Americans ate more</i>
<i>than 100 pounds of red meat</i>

07:13.767 --> 07:15.499
<i>Per person in 2014,</i>

07:15.602 --> 07:19.604
<i>And now, africa and asia</i>
<i>are moving toward</i>
<i>that same diet.</i>

07:19.689 --> 07:25.109
<i>We spoke to ken cook, a food</i>
<i>policy expert, about the state</i>
<i>of meat production today.</i>

07:25.195 --> 07:30.014
70% of the land devoted
to agriculture on the planet

07:30.116 --> 07:31.532
Is devoted to meat production.

07:31.651 --> 07:34.986
That's almost a third
of the entire surface area.

07:35.071 --> 07:39.540
<i>That many acres producing</i>
<i>red meat, pork, chicken,</i>

07:39.659 --> 07:42.359
All of that
is completely unsustainable.

07:42.462 --> 07:48.199
<i>Let's assume that the world</i>
<i>population will grow to</i>
<i>9 billion people by 2050.</i>

07:48.251 --> 07:50.618
<i>There isn't enough land.</i>
<i>There isn't enough water.</i>

07:50.720 --> 07:53.888
There isn't the capacity
for the earth's atmosphere

07:54.007 --> 07:56.707
<i>To absorb all of</i>
<i>the co2 and the methane</i>

07:56.810 --> 07:58.709
<i>That would come out</i>
<i>of animal agriculture.</i>

07:58.812 --> 08:03.481
<i>The problem is that</i>
<i>our focus is on making</i>
<i>the meat as cheap as possible,</i>

08:03.566 --> 08:08.519
And as they cut those corners,
that's where we often have
environmental catastrophes.

08:08.605 --> 08:11.022
<i>To see how</i>
<i>meat production can lead</i>

08:11.074 --> 08:12.990
<i>To those</i>
<i>environmental catastrophes,</i>

08:13.076 --> 08:15.693
<i>We went to duplin county</i>
<i>in north carolina,</i>

08:15.779 --> 08:19.413
<i>Where the pork industry</i>
<i>is so big, the hogs</i>
<i>outnumber people.</i>

08:19.532 --> 08:20.948
So, this is
the lagoon right here.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.450
See the pipes coming out?

08:22.535 --> 08:24.068
It doesn't smell
pretty either.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.921
<i>Larry baldwin monitors cafos</i>
<i>in north carolina</i>

08:27.040 --> 08:28.623
<i>For the waterkeeper alliance.</i>

08:30.126 --> 08:32.092
The pigs are in there,
they're defecating,

08:32.178 --> 08:34.679
So you've got urine and feces
dropping through the floor,

08:34.764 --> 08:37.215
<i>But then there are slots</i>
<i>in that concrete.</i>

08:37.267 --> 08:38.850
<i>The waste falls</i>
<i>through that,</i>

08:38.885 --> 08:41.418
And then gets flushed into
the lagoon, which is what
you see over here.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.938
So, that's where we can see
the pipes coming straight
out of this.

08:44.023 --> 08:47.441
Each one of these buildings
has a pipe that empties
into the lagoon.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.560
That's a hell of
a lot of waste.
Right here!

08:49.646 --> 08:54.148
People would be outraged even
suggesting that that's the way
we would handle human waste.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.733
What's the difference?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.153
<i>And when you see</i>
<i>this region from the air,</i>

08:59.239 --> 09:03.991
<i>The scope of these hog cafos</i>
<i>and their waste is incredible.</i>

09:04.077 --> 09:09.914
From up here you can see
every single cafo is attached
to these huge lagoons.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.393
Whoa, yeah.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.232
There's hundreds of them.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.934
There's such an intense
concentration here.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.333
<i>The ground simply cannot</i>
<i>absorb this much waste,</i>

09:45.451 --> 09:48.035
<i>And according to kemp burdett</i>
<i>of cape fear river watch,</i>

09:48.121 --> 09:50.755
<i>That's wreaking havoc</i>
<i>on local waterways.</i>

09:50.790 --> 09:54.425
This stream is surrounded
by hog farms.

09:54.510 --> 09:57.511
You see nitrogen
and phosphorous levels
off the charts,

09:57.630 --> 09:59.263
Bacterial levels off
the charts.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.599
It's raw feces.

10:01.684 --> 10:05.136
And how many sort of streams
like this are you looking at
in north carolina?

10:05.238 --> 10:08.172
Thousands.
If you're a fisherman
or if you're a swimmer,

10:08.274 --> 10:10.024
If you're throwing
the ball for your dog,

10:10.109 --> 10:11.893
You've got to deal with
dangerous levels of bacteria.

10:11.978 --> 10:15.279
And this creek
flows downstream into
the northeast cape fear river,

10:15.365 --> 10:19.200
Which is a part of the cape
fear river basin, the largest
river basin in north carolina.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.535
It's a problem.
You have to pay more
to treat your water,

10:21.654 --> 10:23.520
Which means you have to pay
more to drink your water.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.072
You drink this water?

10:25.158 --> 10:28.025
A fifth of north
carolinians drink water out
of the cape fear river basin.

10:28.111 --> 10:30.544
<i>And it isn't just</i>
<i>the quality of the water</i>

10:30.663 --> 10:32.196
<i>That's the problem.</i>

10:32.298 --> 10:36.033
<i>In meat-producing</i>
<i>regions in the west,</i>
<i>it's the quantity.</i>

10:36.135 --> 10:41.222
<i>In the dry high plains region,</i>
<i>many feed crops draw water</i>
<i>from the ogallala aquifer,</i>

10:41.341 --> 10:44.725
<i>Which is now</i>
<i>losing water faster</i>
<i>than it can be replenished.</i>

10:44.844 --> 10:47.345
<i>Mike callicrate, a small</i>
<i>cattle rancher in this area,</i>

10:47.430 --> 10:52.183
<i>Broke down the relationship</i>
<i>between water, corn,</i>
<i>and industrial meat.</i>

10:52.268 --> 10:57.021
It takes about
2,500 gallons of water
to produce a bushel of corn.

10:57.106 --> 11:00.858
And if an animal eats
50 bushels of corn
in its time in the feedlot,

11:00.944 --> 11:05.496
We're looking at about 125,000
gallons of water per animal,

11:05.581 --> 11:06.948
Under the industrial model.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.066
So when it comes to those
industrial-scale feedlots,

11:09.168 --> 11:11.502
The majority of
the water they're using

11:11.537 --> 11:14.005
Actually goes into
producing the corn.
That's correct.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.625
And the reason
that jbs has a big feedlot
at yuma, colorado

11:17.710 --> 11:19.010
Is because there's water,

11:19.045 --> 11:22.079
And they don't pay one
dime for that water.

11:22.181 --> 11:26.434
And they pay below the cost
of production, of that corn.

11:26.552 --> 11:28.936
The corn is the cheapest
thing that we can feed.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.938
Because we can buy it
below cost of production.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.557
The water is
subsidizing that operation.

11:33.643 --> 11:37.445
<i>So with free water</i>
<i>and cheap corn,</i>

11:37.563 --> 11:41.232
<i>The price of mass-produced</i>
<i>beef is kept artificially low.</i>

11:41.317 --> 11:43.934
The question is,
how much of
the ogallala aquifer

11:44.037 --> 11:46.570
Do we need to support
an industrial model?

11:46.656 --> 11:48.039
Or any model
as far as that goes?

11:48.124 --> 11:52.493
And if we are so foolish
as to let that precious
resource run out,

11:52.595 --> 11:54.245
That's a tragedy.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.915
<i>Mike showed us the scale</i>
<i>of land and water used</i>

11:58.001 --> 11:59.917
<i>By the giant</i>
<i>meat producers here.</i>

11:59.969 --> 12:02.636
So we're just flying over
yuma county in colorado.

12:02.755 --> 12:05.456
This is one of the huge,
huge scale feedlots.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.759
You've got 100,000 cattle
in this one feedlot down here.

12:08.845 --> 12:10.895
Is this all corn down here,
these circular--?

12:14.450 --> 12:15.766
That's a lot
of corn fields.

12:45.965 --> 12:48.849
<i>While this is the system that</i>
<i>produces most of our meat,</i>

12:48.968 --> 12:52.937
<i>We spoke to one farmer who's</i>
<i>going in a drastically</i>
<i>different direction.</i>

12:52.972 --> 12:58.359
A system that depletes your
resource base will eventually
crash and burn.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.862
<i>Joel salitan is part of</i>
<i>the farm-to-table movement</i>

13:01.981 --> 13:04.181
<i>That focuses on</i>
<i>responsible production.</i>

13:04.233 --> 13:08.536
<i>He uses a system called</i>
<i>rotational grazing.</i>

13:14.794 --> 13:17.128
So you just moved these cows
from this patch into here?

13:17.213 --> 13:20.631
Yes, so, everyday the cows
get a brand-new salad bar.

13:20.716 --> 13:23.084
That was one day's
plateful of food.

13:23.169 --> 13:26.637
Today they get
a new plateful of food.

13:26.722 --> 13:30.391
So there's a huge difference
between where they were just
now and where they are now.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.561
Sure, this looked just like
this yesterday at this time,

13:33.679 --> 13:36.764
And then in 50 days,
this will look like
this again.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.900
So this is the way that cows
have traditionally grazed
on grass, right?

13:40.019 --> 13:43.487
This is the role of
herbivores in nature.

13:43.589 --> 13:46.524
<i>On this type of farm,</i>
<i>every animal has a role,</i>

13:46.609 --> 13:48.742
<i>And even their waste</i>
<i>plays a part.</i>

13:48.861 --> 13:52.229
Joel's demonstrating for us
this integrated system
that he's got going on,

13:52.331 --> 13:56.500
So he's actually moving
his eggmobile containing
all the chickens,

13:56.586 --> 13:58.452
Right to the spot where
the cows have just been.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.372
Here we go!

14:01.457 --> 14:04.074
We follow the cows
with the eggmobiles.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.460
The chickens then scratch
through these cow patties,

14:06.562 --> 14:09.346
Incorporate them
into the soil,
eat out the fly larvae

14:09.432 --> 14:13.300
And actually sanitize
the fields before the cows
come back through,

14:13.386 --> 14:15.803
So it's a very
multi-speciated system.

14:15.888 --> 14:19.390
Never seen anyone so excited
to eat shit before.

14:21.144 --> 14:25.646
Industrial-scale farming
segregated the animal
from its feed.

14:25.731 --> 14:27.481
We grow the corn over here,

14:27.600 --> 14:31.435
The corn then is fed to cows
that are locked up
in a feedlot,

14:31.537 --> 14:35.789
That are generating
so much manure
it's toxic to its ecosystem.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.542
So the whole system that's
supposed to be integrated,

14:38.628 --> 14:42.463
Becomes a segregated
series of liabilities.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.949
<i>If you farm the way</i>

14:46.052 --> 14:48.552
<i>Joel salitan and producers</i>
<i>like salitan farm,</i>

14:48.638 --> 14:52.890
That has tremendous
benefits for the land
and for the environment.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.292
The downside, in our
current economy is,

14:55.394 --> 14:58.896
<i>It takes more time,</i>
<i>more labor, more management.</i>

14:58.981 --> 15:01.565
<i>It's more expensive</i>
<i>to do it that way.</i>

15:01.651 --> 15:04.568
<i>So, instead of moving towards</i>
<i>the more sustainable model</i>

15:04.654 --> 15:06.820
<i>That's been catching on</i>
<i>in parts of america,</i>

15:06.939 --> 15:10.140
<i>It's mass production that's</i>
<i>on the rise in most places.</i>

15:10.243 --> 15:13.777
<i>And the market for cheap,</i>
<i>industrial meat, is blowing up</i>
<i>around the world.</i>

15:13.863 --> 15:16.813
<i>If the meat industry continues</i>
<i>as it is at the moment,</i>

15:16.916 --> 15:19.149
<i>Where does that take us,</i>
<i>in 20 years time?</i>

15:19.235 --> 15:23.704
Meat production globally is
an environmental disaster now.

15:23.789 --> 15:30.160
<i>If we try and expand</i>
<i>meat production to reach</i>
<i>9 billion people by 2050,</i>

15:30.263 --> 15:33.631
It will be a complete,
unthinkable disaster.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.138
Meat production in brazil
is so land-intensive

15:41.224 --> 15:43.173
That it's responsible for
more than two-thirds

15:43.276 --> 15:46.527
<i>Of the deforestation</i>
<i>of the brazilian amazon.</i>

15:46.646 --> 15:48.629
<i>But it's using up</i>
<i>more than just our land,</i>

15:48.731 --> 15:54.068
<i>Because producing a single</i>
<i>pound of meat requires over</i>
<i>1,800 gallons of water.</i>

15:54.153 --> 15:56.954
And that's just one part
of a food production system

15:57.039 --> 16:01.458
That may be threatening
the single most important
resource that we have.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.311
I'm standing in one of
the most fertile regions
of the world,

16:20.396 --> 16:21.929
Tulare county, california.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.982
The crops from this place
feed the entire planet.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.319
The only problem is,
they're running out of water.

16:32.942 --> 16:37.027
<i>Nearly half of the country's</i>
<i>fruits and vegetables</i>
<i>are grown in california,</i>

16:37.113 --> 16:40.497
<i>Which is now locked in the</i>
<i>worst drought in its history.</i>

16:40.583 --> 16:43.734
<i>Farmers here, like mark watte,</i>
<i>are getting desperate.</i>

16:43.836 --> 16:46.120
<i>This land has been</i>
<i>in constant production</i>

16:46.205 --> 16:47.955
<i>Since the mid to late 1800s.</i>

16:48.040 --> 16:51.542
<i>Never in that time frame</i>
<i>has there ever not been</i>
<i>a summer crop grown on it</i>

16:51.627 --> 16:53.377
Until this summer.

16:53.462 --> 16:57.047
So, what you're saying is
that this drought is worse
than anything you've seen.

16:57.133 --> 17:00.267
In the history of farming here
in the san joaquin valley,
yes, absolutely.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.470
<i>California has lost</i>
<i>nearly five billion dollars</i>

17:03.556 --> 17:07.724
<i>And more than 38,000</i>
<i>seasonal farm jobs</i>
<i>in the last two years alone.</i>

17:07.777 --> 17:10.926
<i>And without rain, farmers like</i>
<i>daniel errotabere</i>

17:11.030 --> 17:14.064
<i>Are being forced to pump</i>
<i>more and more water</i>
<i>from underground.</i>

17:14.150 --> 17:17.550
This is a field
that we didn't have
sufficient water to plant

17:17.653 --> 17:19.953
Tomatoes or garlic into.

17:20.071 --> 17:21.739
And here is the field
that we could.

17:23.326 --> 17:24.875
We simply don't
have enough water.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.078
Millions of acre-feet
are being pumped.

17:28.164 --> 17:31.114
I know my own
farming operations,
the water table is going down.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.133
That's not sustainable.

17:33.252 --> 17:35.619
And the concern is,
is it recoverable?

17:35.721 --> 17:38.505
<i>As their crop</i>
<i>yields get smaller,</i>

17:38.591 --> 17:42.125
<i>Many farmers</i>
<i>are installing expensive</i>
<i>drip irrigation systems,</i>

17:42.228 --> 17:46.296
<i>The most efficient way</i>
<i>to irrigate plants</i>
<i>and save water.</i>

17:46.399 --> 17:49.566
You can't get any more
efficient than drip.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.185
You're putting on exactly
what the crop needs.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.605
So you've pretty
much gotten as efficient
as you could possibly be

17:54.690 --> 17:56.357
And you're still
running out of water.

17:56.442 --> 18:00.327
Right. Well, now the last
five years, we've been
pumping a lot of groundwater

18:00.446 --> 18:01.862
To keep this ranch going.

18:01.947 --> 18:03.480
Eventually you're
going to run out.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.699
That's the scary part.
What happens
when it runs out?

18:05.785 --> 18:07.117
I guess we're done.

18:07.203 --> 18:09.953
<i>But while there's still</i>
<i>water left underground,</i>

18:10.039 --> 18:11.839
<i>Farmers are drilling</i>
<i>more wells to get it,</i>

18:11.957 --> 18:14.842
<i>Some at record depths</i>
<i>of 2500 feet</i>

18:14.960 --> 18:17.628
<i>Or ten times deeper</i>
<i>than the state average.</i>

18:21.801 --> 18:23.434
So it looks like you're
digging for oil.

18:23.519 --> 18:28.555
No, it's an old oil rig
that has been converted over
for water wells.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.644
So what's business
like these days?

18:33.729 --> 18:38.282
Right now our wait list
is around between
one to two years,

18:38.367 --> 18:40.901
Depending which rig
and what size of well.

18:40.986 --> 18:43.019
My phone rings constantly.
You know, farmers,

18:43.122 --> 18:45.038
"hey, i lost--
another well went dry."

18:45.124 --> 18:46.874
I don't like to hear
stuff like that.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.959
I don't like to see a farmer
losing their crops.

18:49.044 --> 18:53.363
If they want to stay
in business and farm,
they have to drill a well.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.299
<i>But as more wells are drilled,</i>

18:55.384 --> 18:59.470
<i>California's water is being</i>
<i>depleted by nearly four</i>
<i>trillion gallons per year.</i>

18:59.555 --> 19:03.724
<i>That's more than one billion</i>
<i>gallons every single day.</i>

19:03.843 --> 19:08.429
<i>At that rate of consumption,</i>
<i>the system of reservoirs,</i>
<i>lakes, rivers, and snowpack</i>

19:08.514 --> 19:12.065
<i>That replenishes</i>
<i>california's groundwater</i>
<i>is in critical danger</i>

19:12.184 --> 19:14.184
<i>Despite this winter's</i>
<i>el niÃ±o rains.</i>

19:14.270 --> 19:19.323
<i>This is what the reservoir</i>
<i>lake success looked like</i>
<i>in 2014.</i>

19:19.408 --> 19:24.561
<i>And this was lake success</i>
<i>less than a year later.</i>

19:24.663 --> 19:26.163
In the 42 years
i've been here,

19:26.248 --> 19:28.182
This area here
has never been dry.

19:29.952 --> 19:33.170
We depend on the snowpack
to fill the reservoirs

19:33.255 --> 19:34.905
In the spring
when the snow melts.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.424
These mountains behind me,
these hills and mountains,

19:37.543 --> 19:41.178
There are snowcaps there
and then those melt...
Right.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.013
...And they come
down these rivers

19:43.098 --> 19:44.715
And fill this place.
Correct.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.351
And now, i mean, you can't
even really see where
the river is anymore.

19:47.436 --> 19:51.972
We have actually zero in-flow,
nothing's coming in at all.

19:52.057 --> 19:54.725
We're standing on dried grass

19:54.810 --> 19:57.144
And we should be standing
in five feet of snow.

19:57.229 --> 20:00.981
But people should realize,
we're in an historic drought,

20:01.066 --> 20:03.767
And that demands
unprecedented action.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.404
<i>Governor jerry brown enacted</i>
<i>mandatory, statewide</i>

20:07.490 --> 20:10.874
<i>Water-use reductions</i>
<i>for the first time in history.</i>

20:10.960 --> 20:14.444
<i>But even california's</i>
<i>unprecedented conservation</i>
<i>measures</i>

20:14.497 --> 20:18.882
<i>Won't be enough to halt</i>
<i>a crisis that's gone global.</i>

20:18.968 --> 20:22.786
We're in pasadena, california
at nasa's jet propulsion
laboratory,

20:22.888 --> 20:25.055
Here to speak with
hydrologist jay famiglietti.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.308
<i>Why are we at a nasa lab</i>
<i>when we're trying to talk</i>
<i>about water on earth?</i>

20:28.427 --> 20:33.180
<i>That's because</i>
<i>the best data that we have</i>
<i>comes from satellite imaging.</i>

20:33.265 --> 20:36.299
It's a very colorful
horror story.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.569
The places that are red
are losing water,

20:38.604 --> 20:41.972
And those red spots represent
groundwater depletion.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.157
California is actually
running out of water.

20:44.276 --> 20:48.111
And our wet
seasons don't even rise
to the level of dry seasons.

20:48.197 --> 20:52.315
We would need
to get an additional
12 trillion gallons of water

20:52.418 --> 20:57.204
In storage, in snowpack,
in reservoirs, in groundwater

20:57.289 --> 20:59.006
To sort of climb out
of the drought.

20:59.124 --> 21:01.758
12 trillion.
12 trillion, with a t.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.827
There's a lot of discussion
and hope for an el niÃ±o,

21:03.929 --> 21:09.165
But we need to have
about three years in a row
of above average rainfall

21:09.268 --> 21:11.101
Just to get back
to normal conditions.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.103
It's happening
all over the world.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.972
Very, very clear trends.

21:15.057 --> 21:18.842
The north china plain,
around the himalayas,

21:18.944 --> 21:22.779
Northwestern india,
bangladesh, middle east,

21:22.865 --> 21:25.899
Southern south america
around argentina.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.117
Here's brazil here.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.185
So, they're having
some big issues.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.455
Are there any cities or places
that are most affected?

21:31.540 --> 21:34.658
Well, sao paulo has just been
having a really rough time.

21:36.495 --> 21:38.078
<i>And for the people</i>
<i>of sao paulo,</i>

21:38.163 --> 21:40.130
<i>The most populous</i>
<i>city in brazil,</i>

21:40.215 --> 21:41.832
<i>It's a lot worse</i>
<i>than just a hard time,</i>

21:41.917 --> 21:45.035
<i>As the worst drought</i>
<i>in recorded history,</i>

21:45.137 --> 21:49.806
<i>Has 20 million residents</i>
<i>scrambling in fear for what's</i>
<i>left of their water supply.</i>

21:49.892 --> 21:55.395
<i>And with the population</i>
<i>expected to grow to more</i>
<i>than 23 million in 2025,</i>

21:55.514 --> 21:59.182
<i>A drought-stricken sao paulo</i>
<i>is likely to see more unrest.</i>

22:25.761 --> 22:27.511
Why do you think
this is happening?

22:32.051 --> 22:35.268
<i>And if sao paulo's complex</i>
<i>system of reservoirs fails,</i>

22:35.354 --> 22:38.722
<i>Collecting rainwater alone</i>
<i>won't be enough.</i>

22:38.807 --> 22:40.974
We're standing
at this blue dot,

22:41.060 --> 22:43.527
And behind me is part of
the reservoir that serves

22:43.612 --> 22:46.480
Nearly nine million
people in sao paulo.

22:46.565 --> 22:48.115
This is what it used
to look like,

22:48.233 --> 22:50.984
And this is what
it looks like now.

22:56.525 --> 22:58.325
<i>Marussia whately has been</i>
<i>an advocate</i>

22:58.410 --> 23:02.546
<i>For water conservation</i>
<i>and awareness in brazil</i>
<i>for more than 15 years.</i>

23:02.581 --> 23:05.215
This doesn't really look
like a reservoir.

23:08.303 --> 23:12.673
So this is one of the biggest
reserves of water...

23:12.758 --> 23:14.174
This is the biggest.

23:17.479 --> 23:21.098
Where would the water
naturally have been
several years ago?

23:26.488 --> 23:29.573
That's like hundreds of feet
from where it is now.

23:34.613 --> 23:37.197
So there's a general trend
in the weather pattern here

23:37.282 --> 23:41.702
That there has been
less precipitation
than ever before.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.512
<i> As the levels</i>
<i>in the reservoirs</i>
<i>continue to drop,</i>

23:52.631 --> 23:54.965
<i>Sao paulo's water</i>
<i>utility, sabesp,</i>

23:55.050 --> 23:58.685
<i>Is taking emergency measures</i>
<i>to keep what's left flowing.</i>

23:58.771 --> 24:02.389
<i>The man operating this</i>
<i>excavator for sabesp</i>
<i>saw us filming</i>

24:02.474 --> 24:05.809
<i>And wanted</i>
<i>to tell us how desperate</i>
<i>the situation has become.</i>

24:05.894 --> 24:09.146
<i>We arranged to meet</i>
<i>later that night.</i>

24:18.073 --> 24:21.241
<i> He told us</i>
<i>that water in the reservoir</i>
<i>is actually below</i>

24:21.326 --> 24:23.076
<i>What engineers consider zero.</i>

24:23.162 --> 24:26.329
<i>Meaning that they have to pipe</i>
<i>the remaining water uphill</i>

24:26.415 --> 24:29.299
<i>Just to get it</i>
<i>to the intake pipes.</i>

24:58.413 --> 24:59.830
<i>Dr. Antonio nobre,</i>

24:59.915 --> 25:03.166
<i>Climatologist at</i>
<i>the national institute</i>
<i>of amazonian research,</i>

25:03.252 --> 25:07.704
<i>Believes that the causes</i>
<i>of the crisis originate</i>
<i>2,000 miles away</i>

25:07.790 --> 25:10.207
<i>In the amazon rain forest.</i>

25:21.553 --> 25:25.255
So the trees are
actually fighting...

25:25.357 --> 25:26.857
Fighting the drought.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.085
<i>And those in the know,</i>
<i>understand that this crisis</i>

26:29.171 --> 26:33.173
<i>Has water's value</i>
<i>as a commodity skyrocketing.</i>

26:33.292 --> 26:39.212
<i>The market for water-related</i>
<i>industries is estimated</i>
<i>to be worth $600 billion,</i>

26:39.298 --> 26:42.632
<i>And could reach</i>
<i>one trillion dollars</i>
<i>in the next four years.</i>

26:42.718 --> 26:44.968
Water demand is going
to exceed water supply.

26:45.053 --> 26:48.772
<i>As investors bet on water</i>
<i>becoming the new oil.</i>

26:48.874 --> 26:50.740
<i>Is this a good</i>
<i>time for investors?</i>

26:50.809 --> 26:52.659
One word, and that
is "absolutely."

26:52.778 --> 26:55.228
<i>And with the global</i>
<i>population growing</i>

26:55.314 --> 26:57.030
<i>And water resources shrinking,</i>

26:57.149 --> 27:01.851
<i>There are fewer and fewer</i>
<i>tracts of land that still do</i>
<i>have reliable access to water,</i>

27:01.954 --> 27:04.854
<i>And investors</i>
<i>are snapping them up.</i>

27:04.957 --> 27:07.457
<i>Large-scale agricultural</i>
<i>investors bought up</i>

27:07.542 --> 27:10.160
<i>An estimated</i>
<i>500 million acres of land</i>

27:10.245 --> 27:14.881
<i>Across the developing world</i>
<i>between 2000 and 2010.</i>

27:15.000 --> 27:20.220
We will see the emergence
of hydro-geopolitics. Right?

27:20.339 --> 27:23.373
We will. We'll see
strategizing for water.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.893
It will become the central
resource that we covet

27:27.012 --> 27:29.545
And that we, you know,
that we fight to protect.

27:29.598 --> 27:32.849
<i>We have a global water crisis.</i>

27:32.901 --> 27:36.770
<i>I don't actually think that</i>
<i>it's likely to ever disappear.</i>

27:36.855 --> 27:39.189
We've been fixated
on the other resources

27:39.274 --> 27:41.691
Like oil, energy.

27:41.777 --> 27:46.396
<i>This one has been sneaking</i>
<i>up to take the top position.</i>

27:46.498 --> 27:49.899
Without water there's no food,
without water there's
no energy,

27:50.002 --> 27:51.734
<i>Without water there's no life.</i>

27:51.787 --> 27:56.289
Where are we going to be
50 years from now if we
don't take any action?

27:56.391 --> 27:57.958
We'll be in
the post-apocalypse.

27:58.043 --> 28:00.210
The apocalypse
will have happened.
