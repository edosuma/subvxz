Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.160 --> 00:12.109
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.130 --> 00:15.019
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:15.039 --> 00:17.010
They were good.

00:17.030 --> 00:20.039

00:22.170 --> 00:24.190
Then there was Gargamel.

00:24.210 --> 00:28.000
The evil wizard.
He was bad.

00:28.019 --> 00:30.070
Ohh, I hate Smurfs.

I'll find your village some day.
You'll be sorry..

(male narrator)
Well, the forest is still there

00:47.070 --> 00:51.070
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.090 --> 00:55.149
And if you were good,
you may just catch a glimpse

00:55.170 --> 00:57.189

Don't smurf it,
he was right with us.

01:16.140 --> 01:17.170
What happened to him?

Maybe, Gargamel got him.

No, he's not here.

If he was,
he'd be in my soup pot.

Of course Gargamel's
up to something.

You-you're,
you're-you're making me m-mad.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.169
I don't believe it.

10:34.190 --> 10:38.139
His magic is even more powerful
than Papa Smurf's.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.129
Now do you believe me?

10:40.149 --> 10:44.000
No, you are a fraud, a-a fake.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.059
Wait till I get my hands on you.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.200
Very well.

10:52.029 --> 10:55.080
What is it you wish, master?

10:55.100 --> 10:57.090
[all exclaiming]

10:57.110 --> 11:00.110
Drive the evil wizard
from the forest.

11:01.029 --> 11:03.220
[trees growling]

11:04.000 --> 11:07.039
No, no, no, keep
them away from me.

11:08.139 --> 11:09.220
[ghoulish groans]

11:10.000 --> 11:12.059
Ah! Let me out of here!

11:12.080 --> 11:14.110
[Gargamel screaming]

11:14.129 --> 11:17.110
Oh, thank you,
Sorcerer Smurf.

11:17.129 --> 11:19.080
You saved our village.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.059
Your magic
is even more powerful

11:21.080 --> 11:22.120
than Papa Smurf's.

11:22.139 --> 11:23.220
(Hefty)
Where is Papa Smurf?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.139
We've gotta go back
to the mountain and--

11:25.159 --> 11:28.190
Don't worry, Hefty, I'm fine.

11:30.210 --> 11:33.100
[all cheering]

11:33.120 --> 11:36.019
Oh, I knew it was you
all the time, Papa Smurf.

11:36.039 --> 11:39.000
I was just testing
the others to see if..

11:42.070 --> 11:43.210
Unh!

11:43.230 --> 11:46.200
How did you smurf
all that magic, Papa Smurf?

11:46.220 --> 11:49.029
Oh, I didn't do it alone.

11:49.049 --> 11:53.019
Dreamy, Handy, Greedy,
Jokey, Poet, Harmony.

11:53.039 --> 11:56.139
Oh, but how did you make
that earth tremble, Papa Smurf?

11:56.159 --> 11:58.029
Very simple, Clumsy.

11:58.049 --> 11:59.190
Get ready Smurfs.

11:59.210 --> 12:01.139
'Hit it!'

12:07.019 --> 12:08.059
[thud]

12:08.080 --> 12:11.000
(all)
Yay!

12:11.019 --> 12:13.070
Nobody's better than you,
Papa Smurf.

12:13.090 --> 12:15.120
You're the best,
I always say.

12:18.129 --> 12:19.110
Unh!

12:19.129 --> 12:21.190
When will I ever learn?

12:24.049 --> 12:27.049
Papa Smurf, I don't
feel so good.

12:27.070 --> 12:30.049
Hmm, your coloring
is a sickly blue

12:30.070 --> 12:31.120
but where does it hurt?

12:31.139 --> 12:33.039
Well, all over.

12:33.059 --> 12:36.200
Hmm, I think I know
what the problem is, Grouchy.

12:36.220 --> 12:40.049
I was wrong. You were trying
too hard to be happy

12:40.070 --> 12:42.100
and just made yourself sicker.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.129
You mean,
I can be my own self?

12:44.149 --> 12:47.149
I hate to say it, Grouchy, but..

12:47.169 --> 12:48.149
...yes!

12:48.169 --> 12:50.000
[all laughing]

12:51.120 --> 12:53.049
Thank you, Papa Smurf.

12:53.070 --> 12:55.110
I hate being happy.
