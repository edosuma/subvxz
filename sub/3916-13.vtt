WEBVTT

00:00.461 --> 00:01.994
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.029 --> 00:03.695
- You must be new here.
- Yeah, I'm Nick.

00:03.730 --> 00:04.730
I'm Mariana Foster,

00:04.764 --> 00:06.699
and I'm running for Class President.

00:06.733 --> 00:07.833
"Lexi for Prexi"? Really?

00:07.867 --> 00:09.802
Your senior projects, have
you guys given any thought

00:09.836 --> 00:10.803
to what you're gonna do?

00:10.837 --> 00:12.671
A rock opera.

00:12.706 --> 00:14.707
Well, Shakespeare's pretty intense.

00:14.741 --> 00:15.708
We have to break up.

00:15.742 --> 00:17.109
I'm so sorry, Talya.

00:17.143 --> 00:19.745
What is that kid doing here?

00:19.779 --> 00:21.647
I invited him.

00:21.681 --> 00:23.015
I'm so happy you're here.

00:23.049 --> 00:25.084
My beautiful granddaughters
are getting to know each other.

00:26.119 --> 00:27.786
We don't know that she's
having a mastectomy.

00:27.821 --> 00:28.787
She has breast cancer.

00:28.822 --> 00:31.090
She has a pre-cancerous condition.

00:31.124 --> 00:33.759
"Super Callie"? You're such a dork.

00:33.793 --> 00:35.661
I got into this accident.

00:35.695 --> 00:37.696
Those people you almost
killed, it was the Fosters.

00:37.731 --> 00:39.131
What about AJ? Can we at least

00:39.165 --> 00:40.132
wait till after the funeral?

00:40.166 --> 00:42.001
Where are they, Mike?

00:42.035 --> 00:44.003
Look at all the comments
you've already gotten.

00:44.304 --> 00:45.958
_

00:49.042 --> 00:51.977
- These mushrooms are all rotten, Will.
- They're not all rotten.

00:52.012 --> 00:53.946
You just have to cut around the bad part.

00:53.980 --> 00:55.014
That's what I keep telling you.

00:55.048 --> 00:57.049
Why risk us all getting sick?

00:57.083 --> 00:58.050
Just get rid of 'em.

00:58.084 --> 00:59.952
Nice, Mom. And subtle for once.

00:59.986 --> 01:01.854
Well, I'm just saying, you know, mold...

01:01.888 --> 01:03.055
grows and spreads.

01:03.089 --> 01:05.991
It's kinda like cancer,
but that's your decision.

01:06.026 --> 01:07.826
Yes, yes, it is.

01:07.861 --> 01:08.861
They're gonna take the cancer out

01:08.895 --> 01:10.629
with a lumpectomy, Sharon.

01:10.663 --> 01:12.765
- Okay, can we not... just not...
- What if they miss some and it comes back?

01:12.799 --> 01:13.899
Recurrence in the same
breast is fairly low.

01:13.933 --> 01:15.968
Oh, fairly low.

01:16.002 --> 01:17.036
Well, what about the other breast?

01:17.070 --> 01:20.773
Do you want your daughter
to have a double mastectomy

01:20.807 --> 01:22.007
when she really doesn't need one?

01:22.042 --> 01:23.809
- Okay...
- I can't really say that having my only child

01:23.843 --> 01:26.712
have a double mastectomy is
at the top of my wish list.

01:26.746 --> 01:28.714
I'm just saying it's better
to be safe than sorry.

01:28.748 --> 01:29.815
- Get rid of 'em.
- Stop. Please.

01:29.849 --> 01:31.884
- I...
- We're not debating this anymore.

01:31.918 --> 01:34.853
I... I'mma do some Tai Chi outside.

01:34.888 --> 01:37.689
No, Will. Please stay.
Stay, stay, stay, okay?

01:37.724 --> 01:38.824
And... and... and...
and speaking of staying,

01:38.858 --> 01:39.792
when are you guys going?

01:41.761 --> 01:44.129
- I don't...
- You know what? Let me rephrase that.

01:44.164 --> 01:47.833
Please go on your trip, Mom, Will, okay?

01:47.867 --> 01:49.668
Have fun. Go.

01:49.702 --> 01:51.737
We are fine. I'm fi... We're gonna be fine.

01:51.771 --> 01:52.805
Really.

01:54.841 --> 01:56.742
Mom... please, Mom.

01:56.776 --> 01:58.677
Mom, please. Mom, come on.

01:58.711 --> 02:00.646
Hey, Dad is here.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.681
Oh, hi, Mike.

02:02.715 --> 02:04.616
And goodbye, Brandon.

02:04.651 --> 02:06.085
I know it's all very sudden and unexpected,

02:06.119 --> 02:08.020
but your mother's asked me to leave.

02:08.054 --> 02:10.622
- Will, let's... let's pack up the RV.
- Mom, really?

02:10.657 --> 02:13.625
Your mushrooms are fine.

02:13.660 --> 02:15.060
Um, the real ones.

02:15.128 --> 02:17.663
They're... they're
absolutely perfect to eat.

02:17.697 --> 02:18.897
Good to know.

02:21.034 --> 02:22.968
So what's going on?

02:23.002 --> 02:24.036
Nothing.

02:26.072 --> 02:28.874
- Okay.
- This a bad time?

02:28.908 --> 02:30.075
No, no, no. We gotta get this done.

02:37.050 --> 02:39.051
So have you told the kids about Ty?

02:39.085 --> 02:40.919
No, I just...

02:40.954 --> 02:42.221
I wanna wait till we find them,

02:42.255 --> 02:44.022
and the longer they're out
there, the harder that's gonna be,

02:44.057 --> 02:45.891
so let's get this affidavit filed

02:45.925 --> 02:46.992
and we can get this arrest warrant.

02:47.026 --> 02:48.927
And what about Callie?

02:48.962 --> 02:50.129
What if AJ reaches out to her?

02:50.163 --> 02:52.798
She promised me that she
would let me know if he does.

02:52.832 --> 02:53.932
Oh.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.933

04:35.670 --> 04:37.738
Whoa, whoa. I'm not an actor.

04:37.772 --> 04:39.706
No, come on. We're all acting all the time.

04:39.741 --> 04:41.642
- Then you do it.
- No, I'm composing.

04:41.676 --> 04:43.610
- So am I.
- Well, I'm also directing.

04:43.645 --> 04:44.711
Y... you have to do it.

04:44.746 --> 04:46.580
Okay? That was amazing.

04:47.849 --> 04:48.815
Really?

04:50.785 --> 04:53.620
Trust me.

04:53.655 --> 04:54.755
Okay.

04:55.857 --> 04:56.823
Okay.

04:56.858 --> 05:00.594
So, now all we need to
do is find our Juliet.

05:00.628 --> 05:02.563
What about Talya?

05:02.597 --> 05:04.031
Talya? Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

05:04.065 --> 05:06.600
Yeah! She's a good actress and she's
got the best voice in drama club.

05:06.634 --> 05:07.768
Yeah, she's my ex.

05:07.802 --> 05:09.570
What's the big deal?

05:09.604 --> 05:11.738
It's not like you're hung
up on her or anything.

05:11.773 --> 05:14.575
L... let's just say it didn't end...

05:14.609 --> 05:15.776
all that well, okay?

05:15.810 --> 05:18.579
Okay, so what?

05:18.613 --> 05:20.681
We're seriously gonna hold auditions?

05:22.817 --> 05:25.752
You really want to suffer
through every pitchy

05:25.787 --> 05:28.722
American Idol wannabe in
school who thinks they can sing?

05:31.793 --> 05:33.794
Okay, that's why we should ask Talya.

05:33.828 --> 05:36.730
Mat, even if I didn't think
that was a terrible idea,

05:36.764 --> 05:40.567
which I do, there's no
way she'd do it, okay?

05:40.602 --> 05:42.603
She hates my guts.

05:42.637 --> 05:43.770
No, no, we're gonna have
to find someone else.

05:46.641 --> 05:48.675
I want it to say "I'm confident.

05:48.710 --> 05:50.677
You can trust me with your vote."

05:50.712 --> 05:51.812
So, what do you think?

05:51.846 --> 05:53.714
First one or second one?

05:53.748 --> 05:55.582
Uh, second one.

05:55.617 --> 05:56.717
You're not even looking.

05:58.786 --> 06:00.587
Sexy Junior Class President

06:00.622 --> 06:02.656
- or Confident Junior...
- Yeah, the... The sporty... whatever that one...

06:02.690 --> 06:04.591
But that wasn't even an option.

06:18.773 --> 06:20.573
_

06:21.676 --> 06:23.777
Hey, what the... Excuse me!

06:23.811 --> 06:27.547
Whoa, nice rack.

06:27.582 --> 06:28.749
Get out!

06:28.783 --> 06:31.585
Both of you, get out!

06:31.619 --> 06:32.619
And put the toys away!

06:32.654 --> 06:33.754
Ana's coming over with the baby!

06:33.788 --> 06:35.589
Ugh!

06:35.623 --> 06:36.690
Can you believe them?

06:39.694 --> 06:40.761
Why are you looking at me like that?

06:40.795 --> 06:42.663
Can you track the location

06:42.697 --> 06:44.598
of someone who's messaging
me on Fost and Found?

06:44.632 --> 06:45.766
Probably.

06:53.074 --> 06:55.642
So who's "Ana with the baby," huh?

06:55.677 --> 06:56.743
Some chick you knocked up?

06:56.778 --> 06:58.679
No, it's our birth mom.

06:58.713 --> 07:00.013
So all of you are adopted?

07:00.048 --> 07:01.948
Yeah, except Brandon.

07:01.983 --> 07:02.983
One of my moms had him.

07:03.017 --> 07:03.984
And none of you have a dad?

07:04.018 --> 07:05.585
Well, no,

07:05.620 --> 07:08.588
we all have dads somewhere,

07:08.623 --> 07:10.624
but me and Mariana don't really know

07:10.658 --> 07:11.625
anything about ours.

07:11.659 --> 07:13.927
I mean, aren't you curious who he is?

07:13.961 --> 07:15.562
I mean, what if he's, like,

07:15.596 --> 07:16.897
I don't know, Pitbull?

07:16.931 --> 07:18.899
I doubt my dad's Pitbull.

07:18.933 --> 07:20.867
Or maybe he's Mario Lopez.

07:20.902 --> 07:22.569
- Ow.
- Ha, ha.

07:22.603 --> 07:24.538
All right, but seriously,

07:24.572 --> 07:26.807
don't you wanna know who he is?

07:30.308 --> 07:33.808
_

07:33.848 --> 07:35.882
Hold... hold on, why are you naming AJ?

07:35.917 --> 07:37.751
The warrant's for Ty.

07:37.785 --> 07:38.885
I think we have to.

07:40.955 --> 07:42.889
He's just a runaway, Stef.

07:42.924 --> 07:46.760
He's aiding and abetting
a fugitive, Mike, okay?

07:46.794 --> 07:47.928
And that's a crime.

07:47.962 --> 07:51.898
We don't... we don't know
if AJ even knows what Ty did.

07:51.933 --> 07:53.867
He could have just taken
off with his brother.

07:53.901 --> 07:55.869
Do you honestly think
that they would skip town

07:55.903 --> 07:58.638
24 hours before their grandmother's funeral

07:58.673 --> 07:59.740
if AJ didn't know?

07:59.774 --> 08:03.610
He knew, Mike... and they took off

08:03.644 --> 08:04.778
because they knew that
we were getting close.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.650
Come on. He's 17, Stef,

08:10.685 --> 08:12.619
and with his prior, they
could try him as an adult.

08:12.653 --> 08:13.587
You want AJ to go to prison?

08:14.722 --> 08:17.557
I feel badly, Mike. I do.

08:17.592 --> 08:19.559
Okay? But he is 17,

08:19.594 --> 08:22.696
and he is old enough to know
the consequences of his actions.

08:24.097 --> 08:25.997
_

08:26.667 --> 08:30.537
All I could track was that
the IP address is local.

08:30.571 --> 08:32.005
What do you mean?

08:32.039 --> 08:33.539
Somewhere in San Diego,

08:33.573 --> 08:36.610
but I can't pinpoint exactly where.

08:36.644 --> 08:38.544
Wait, AJ's here?

08:38.578 --> 08:39.946
Looks like it.

08:39.981 --> 08:41.548
Are you gonna tell Moms?

08:42.984 --> 08:45.919
I think... I think I'm gonna
try and get him to come home.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.952
- You know Lexi, my former best friend?
- Mm-hmm.

08:50.987 --> 08:52.587
She's running against
me for Class President.

08:52.622 --> 08:54.956
Well, I thought you guys
made up after that debacle...

08:54.991 --> 08:55.924
I mean, debate.

08:55.958 --> 08:57.793
Do you even know what "debacle" means?

08:57.827 --> 08:58.927
Uh, yeah.

08:59.962 --> 09:01.863
Okay, maybe that was Nick's joke.

09:01.898 --> 09:03.732
Well, if you're gonna steal jokes,

09:03.766 --> 09:05.901
you should probably steal them
from someone who isn't a total ass.

09:05.968 --> 09:07.736
Just saying.

09:07.770 --> 09:09.905
I thought that Lexi and her family
had to move back to Honduras.

09:09.939 --> 09:12.841
They did, but they got
their visas, so they're back.

09:12.875 --> 09:13.842
That's nice.

09:13.876 --> 09:15.877
Wait, wasn't Lexi also your ex-girlfriend?

09:15.912 --> 09:18.747
Oh, uh... yeah.

09:18.781 --> 09:19.848
Are you guys gonna get back together?

09:19.882 --> 09:21.783
Uh...

09:21.818 --> 09:23.652
probably not.

09:23.686 --> 09:24.686
Probably not?

09:24.720 --> 09:26.688
Okay, not.

09:26.722 --> 09:27.722
Good answer.

09:27.757 --> 09:29.591
I have to get this away from me.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.626
- Is everyone else done?
- Yeah.

09:35.631 --> 09:37.766
Uh, so, I was, um...

09:37.800 --> 09:41.570
I was telling my buddy, Nick, about you,

09:41.604 --> 09:44.673
and he asked me if I knew anything

09:44.707 --> 09:46.575
about my birth father...

09:47.710 --> 09:51.580
uh, which I... I don't really...

09:51.614 --> 09:52.981
and I was wondering

09:53.015 --> 09:56.585
if there was anything you could tell me.

09:56.619 --> 09:57.652
Um, like what?

09:57.687 --> 09:59.955
Uh, like...

10:01.057 --> 10:02.924
what's his name...

10:02.959 --> 10:04.559
what was he like?

10:04.594 --> 10:05.994
Um...

10:07.630 --> 10:09.965
uh, his name was Gabriel.

10:09.999 --> 10:12.567
I don't really know much about him.

10:13.903 --> 10:14.903
We met at a party.

10:14.937 --> 10:16.972
It... it was a one-time thing.

10:17.006 --> 10:18.940
I don't even know where he is

10:18.975 --> 10:20.041
or whatever happened to him.

10:23.079 --> 10:24.880
Sorry.

10:24.914 --> 10:26.014
It's okay.

10:26.048 --> 10:27.015
You don't have to be sorry.

10:27.049 --> 10:28.850
It's not a big deal.

10:28.885 --> 10:29.918
Grandma's leaving!

10:29.952 --> 10:31.920
Oh!

10:31.954 --> 10:33.955
I just want to...

10:33.990 --> 10:38.827
thank most of you for being so gracious

10:38.861 --> 10:40.862
and, and welcoming.

10:40.897 --> 10:43.798
My family.

10:43.833 --> 10:45.800
My treasures.

10:45.835 --> 10:46.968
Oh...

10:47.003 --> 10:48.837
my treasures.

10:48.871 --> 10:51.873
My only living relatives.

10:51.908 --> 10:55.777
The only people in the world
who actually matter to me.

10:55.811 --> 10:58.647
Well, you matter to me, Will.

11:01.684 --> 11:03.652
- Stefanie?
- Yeah?

11:03.686 --> 11:06.755
I don't know when we'll
see each other again.

11:06.789 --> 11:08.690
Do you have to be so melodramatic, Mother?

11:08.724 --> 11:11.626
- Just stating facts.
- Mm-hmm...

11:11.661 --> 11:13.628
Safe trip!

11:13.663 --> 11:15.030
See you later.

11:35.084 --> 11:37.018
Oh, my...

11:40.656 --> 11:43.024
He ran away? Why?

11:43.059 --> 11:44.025
I guess to be with his brother.

11:45.628 --> 11:47.963
I know you really cared
about him. I'm sorry.

11:47.997 --> 11:51.032
Well, at least now I can go back to
creating my online dating profile.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.934
Why don't you date Ana?

11:52.969 --> 11:55.003
You guys would be so cute together.

11:55.037 --> 11:57.906
- Yeah, we're just...
- We're just friends.

11:58.941 --> 12:00.809
Um...

12:00.843 --> 12:01.943
I think someone needs changing.

12:01.978 --> 12:03.812
- Oh...
- I'll change her...

12:03.846 --> 12:04.946
so you two "friends" can talk.

12:09.852 --> 12:11.820
So...

12:11.854 --> 12:14.823
listen, there's a little
more to this AJ story.

12:16.892 --> 12:19.794
Stef and I think that his brother, Ty,

12:19.829 --> 12:22.664
was the driver who hit you and the twins.

12:26.736 --> 12:29.638
Sorry, I... I was just
gonna go say bye to Grandma.

12:33.743 --> 12:35.710
Hey, Mom, what'd you do to the RV?

12:35.745 --> 12:37.812
As difficult as it is to believe, Stefanie,

12:37.847 --> 12:39.681
I didn't do anything.

12:39.715 --> 12:40.749
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you think I would

12:40.783 --> 12:43.752
really do something and
keep myself someplace

12:43.786 --> 12:45.654
where I'm so unwelcome?

12:45.688 --> 12:47.622
You're always welcome here, Mom,

12:47.657 --> 12:49.591
but your opinions, however...

12:49.625 --> 12:51.726
I'll just keep my opinions
to myself and we'll...

12:51.761 --> 12:54.663
push the old RV out of your driveway

12:54.697 --> 12:56.631
and into the streets someplace.

12:56.666 --> 12:58.600
Actually, we're gonna have
to borrow their electricity,

12:58.634 --> 12:59.701
if you ladies don't mind.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.002
- Oh.
- Of course we don't mind.

13:01.037 --> 13:02.604
I'll pay for the utility bill this month.

13:02.638 --> 13:04.572
- Not necessary, Mother.
- Oh, I insist.

13:04.607 --> 13:05.940
Of course you do.

13:05.975 --> 13:07.008
By the way, um...

13:07.043 --> 13:10.011
AJ agreed to meet me tomorrow after school.

13:10.046 --> 13:11.579
Fingers crossed.

13:13.582 --> 13:15.016
- Who else knows?
- About Ty?

13:15.051 --> 13:16.551
Nobody.

13:16.585 --> 13:17.919
Let's keep it that way.

13:17.953 --> 13:20.021
Your mom doesn't want the other
kids to know until we find them.

13:22.024 --> 13:23.558
I'm sorry, Dad.

13:23.592 --> 13:25.894
Maybe you were right about AJ.

13:25.928 --> 13:27.829
I guess I should've never trusted him.

13:31.067 --> 13:33.768
I... I mean, I... I don't know, Dad.

13:33.803 --> 13:35.003
He was...

13:35.037 --> 13:36.771
in a tough position.

13:36.806 --> 13:38.006
Ty is his family...

13:38.040 --> 13:40.875
He made a mistake.

13:40.910 --> 13:42.777
Committed a crime, Brandon.

13:43.879 --> 13:45.780
Well, yeah, but I committed a crime.

13:46.882 --> 13:48.817
When I made those fake IDs. Remember?

13:48.851 --> 13:50.752
And the only reason why
I didn't get arrested

13:50.786 --> 13:51.853
is because my parents are cops.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.623
I...

13:56.792 --> 13:58.860
Look...

13:58.894 --> 14:01.629
I have made some bad choices.

14:01.664 --> 14:02.731
You never gave up on me, Dad.

14:02.765 --> 14:04.766
You don't give up on family.

14:07.636 --> 14:08.636
I don't know.

14:08.671 --> 14:10.572
All I'm saying is maybe cut him some slack.

14:15.611 --> 14:17.612
- Hey, I'm heading out.
- Okay. See ya.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.584
What's up?

14:22.618 --> 14:25.553
Well, I'm not sure if I should
even be saying anything...

14:26.722 --> 14:28.623
- About what?
- About your dad.

14:28.657 --> 14:30.558
Your birth dad.

14:32.995 --> 14:34.629
Wh... what about him?

14:35.965 --> 14:38.900
Well, you know how my
dad's a contractor, right?

14:38.934 --> 14:40.001
Right.

14:40.035 --> 14:42.570
Anyway, I heard him talking
to my mom the other day,

14:42.605 --> 14:45.840
and he was saying how he just
hired Gabriel on one of his jobs.

14:51.947 --> 14:52.981
Does Ana know?

14:53.015 --> 14:54.015
I don't think so,

14:54.049 --> 14:56.017
but from what I heard,
it doesn't sound like

14:56.051 --> 14:58.820
your dad was just some random guy.

14:58.854 --> 14:59.921
I think he was her boyfriend.

15:02.892 --> 15:04.759
I can find out where he's working

15:04.794 --> 15:05.894
if you wanna know.

15:12.497 --> 15:14.340
Vote Mariana for Junior Class President.

15:14.425 --> 15:17.226
Cool. Awesome. Thank you.

15:18.201 --> 15:20.202
You want a button?

15:20.236 --> 15:21.303
Hi.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.272
Hey...

15:23.306 --> 15:25.240
Talya...

15:25.360 --> 15:27.327
So, Mat told me what you're doing

15:27.362 --> 15:30.364
for your senior project, and
I'd love to be your Juliet.

15:30.398 --> 15:34.368
I mean, not your Juliet, but I mean...

15:34.402 --> 15:38.171
Right. Uh, yeah, no, that...
that'd be... that'd be great.

15:38.206 --> 15:39.339
Here's the thing, we're
actually having, um,

15:39.374 --> 15:41.241
open auditions.

15:41.275 --> 15:44.244
My mom's Vice Principal, as you know,

15:44.278 --> 15:47.147
so, um, she's kinda making us, so...

15:47.181 --> 15:49.216
but you... you should
totally come to audition,

15:49.250 --> 15:50.584
you know, if... if you want to.

15:50.618 --> 15:52.152
No problem.

15:52.186 --> 15:53.553
Prepare to be blown away.

16:15.476 --> 16:17.411
Hey, Callie.

16:17.445 --> 16:19.112
How have you been?

16:19.147 --> 16:20.480
Um, good. Yeah.

16:20.515 --> 16:22.382
- Good.
- Yeah.

16:22.417 --> 16:25.352
You know, a bunch of the kids at the
center are talking about Fost and Found.

16:25.386 --> 16:26.553
Such a great idea.

16:26.587 --> 16:29.389
Hey, congratulations! You got adopted!

16:29.424 --> 16:32.359
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm so glad things are going so well, Callie.

16:32.393 --> 16:33.493
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

16:33.528 --> 16:35.495
You know, I was actually
gonna reach out to you,

16:35.530 --> 16:38.398
see about doing an event,
a Fost and Found event

16:38.433 --> 16:40.400
- at the Drop-In Center, if you're interested.
- Um, you know,

16:40.435 --> 16:42.369
that sounds great, but,
uh, I actually have to go

16:42.403 --> 16:44.371
- 'cause I have to meet someone, but, um...
- But... Oh...

16:44.405 --> 16:45.505
- ... let's talk soon, yeah? For sure.
- Okay.

16:45.540 --> 16:47.307
- Okay. Bye.
- Yeah, cool. We'll talk later.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.233
Open auditions?

17:13.267 --> 17:15.167
We said we weren't gonna do that.

17:15.203 --> 17:17.204
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know. Okay.

17:17.238 --> 17:19.271
I may have panicked a little
bit when Talya said she wanted

17:19.307 --> 17:21.241
- to be my Juliet.
- But that's good, right?

17:21.275 --> 17:23.076
That means she doesn't hate you after all.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.078
Oh, no, no, I'm pretty
sure she still hates me.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.112
But you know Talya.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.247
She's ambitious and she loves drama...

17:27.281 --> 17:29.516
Okay, okay, I get it. It's awkward.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.551
But do you wanna do all this work

17:31.586 --> 17:33.553
and then cast a Juliet who can't sing?

17:35.156 --> 17:36.223
Hm?

17:36.257 --> 17:38.492
We have to be professional here.

17:38.526 --> 17:40.460
Well, now we have to have the auditions

17:40.495 --> 17:42.128
or else she's gonna know I lied to her.

17:42.163 --> 17:43.230
Fine.

17:43.264 --> 17:46.099
But when Talya auditions
and she is the best Juliet,

17:46.133 --> 17:49.569
you're just gonna have to suck it up, deal?

17:49.604 --> 17:52.439
- Yeah, okay, deal.
- Now look me in the eyes when you say that.

17:53.574 --> 17:55.475
Deal.

17:55.510 --> 17:56.476
Thank you.

17:58.613 --> 18:00.347
My eyes hurt.

18:00.381 --> 18:02.482
Do you wanna maybe do something else?

18:02.517 --> 18:04.384
No, it's okay. I wanna keep playing.

18:04.418 --> 18:06.386
You can do whatever you want.

18:06.420 --> 18:09.256
Do you want a snack?

18:09.290 --> 18:10.390
I'm gonna go in the kitchen.

18:23.437 --> 18:25.205
Hey.

18:25.239 --> 18:26.239
Hi.

18:28.209 --> 18:29.276
Where's Jude?

18:29.310 --> 18:31.144
Don't know.

18:44.158 --> 18:48.128
So is Jack, like, your...
your new best friend now?

18:48.162 --> 18:50.130
He's friends with our Xbox,

18:50.164 --> 18:51.197
but that's about it.

18:53.601 --> 18:55.168
How's Connor?

18:55.202 --> 18:57.170
Who knows?

18:57.204 --> 18:58.171
Are you guys still...

18:58.205 --> 18:59.573
Yeah, we're... still.

19:01.175 --> 19:03.143
When's he gonna come see you then?

19:03.177 --> 19:04.277
I don't know.

19:04.312 --> 19:07.514
He's all into his new school
and now he's doing football,

19:07.548 --> 19:09.449
so he's practically
got games every weekend.

19:09.483 --> 19:11.117
Yeah, but LA's only a few hours away.

19:11.152 --> 19:13.119
Might as well be another planet.

19:22.552 --> 19:25.488
- So what else did she say?
- Nothing.

19:25.522 --> 19:29.425
Just that his name's Gabriel
and he was some random dude.

19:29.459 --> 19:30.593
That's it?

19:30.627 --> 19:33.529
Yeah, and then my cousin said that

19:33.563 --> 19:36.465
he was more like her
boyfriend or something.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.566
Dude...

19:37.601 --> 19:40.369
one of those guys could be him.

19:46.476 --> 19:47.543
- You ever see his picture?
- No.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.445
I told you, I have no
idea what he looks like.

19:52.416 --> 19:54.383
- Hey, what about him?
- Which one?

19:54.418 --> 19:55.518
That guy with the nail gun. Right there.

19:55.552 --> 19:57.319
He looks just like you.

19:57.354 --> 19:58.354
That's gotta be your dad.

20:00.524 --> 20:03.292
Dude, go talk to him.

20:03.326 --> 20:04.326
I can't just go up to him

20:04.361 --> 20:05.394
and be like, "Hey, I'm your son."

20:05.429 --> 20:07.263
- Why not?
- Because!

20:07.297 --> 20:07.941
What if I yell out his name?

20:07.942 --> 20:09.352
- See if he even turns around...
- No, don't!

20:10.333 --> 20:12.468
- Then what are we even doing here?
- Look, I don't know, man, okay?

20:14.438 --> 20:16.405
All right, let's just... let's just go.

20:18.241 --> 20:20.342
Come on! Drive! I mean it! Let's go!

20:32.747 --> 20:33.714
Jesus!

20:33.748 --> 20:36.783
Hey, toss me that socket wrench, would ya?

20:39.687 --> 20:41.622
Uh... which one?

20:41.656 --> 20:43.090
The long one.

20:44.759 --> 20:45.792
That's it.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.729
Muchas gracias.

20:51.666 --> 20:53.033
That's cool you know how to fix cars.

20:53.067 --> 20:55.068
Well, my dad was a mechanic, so...

20:56.771 --> 20:59.640
My dad works in construction...

20:59.674 --> 21:00.607
I think.

21:01.676 --> 21:02.643
You think?

21:04.646 --> 21:06.947
He's my birth dad. I don't actually know.

21:06.981 --> 21:08.949
Well, do you want to?

21:12.654 --> 21:13.620
I don't know.

21:15.033 --> 21:16.534
I happen to believe

21:16.568 --> 21:18.936
that man's connection to
his father shapes his life,

21:18.971 --> 21:22.874
and he has to choose how
that relationship or...

21:22.941 --> 21:25.009
you know, lack of one is gonna define him.

21:28.046 --> 21:29.981
So...

21:30.015 --> 21:31.549
do you think I should get to know him?

21:33.051 --> 21:34.852
Doesn't matter what I think.

21:34.887 --> 21:36.921
Matters if you think you have
to know who your dad is...

21:38.824 --> 21:39.824
to know who you are.

21:57.910 --> 21:59.744
Where's your friend?

21:59.778 --> 22:01.712
I guess he went home.

22:01.747 --> 22:02.847
He didn't say goodbye.

22:02.881 --> 22:05.750
Oh, that's odd.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.785
- He's odd.
- Oh.

22:13.659 --> 22:14.759
I think I found him.

22:26.838 --> 22:28.639
Hey!

22:28.674 --> 22:29.807
Hey, what the hell are
you doing in my moms' bed?

22:29.841 --> 22:32.610
- Jude!
- What is going on?

22:32.644 --> 22:35.746
I... I just came up to use the bathroom.

22:35.781 --> 22:37.648
But so you decided to climb in their bed?

22:37.683 --> 22:38.649
Who does that?

22:38.684 --> 22:40.618
I'm sorry. I'm just... I was...

22:40.652 --> 22:42.653
I was tired and it
looked really comfortable.

22:42.688 --> 22:43.754
What are you? Goldilocks?

22:43.789 --> 22:45.022
Jude, stop it!

22:45.057 --> 22:47.592
I'm... I'm gonna go.

22:47.626 --> 22:49.694
Wha... Good. And don't come back.

22:49.728 --> 22:51.662
Can I give you a ride home?

22:51.697 --> 22:52.964
No, thanks.

22:55.471 --> 22:57.472
Look, I know you're upset about Connor,

22:57.506 --> 22:58.473
but don't take it out on him.

22:58.507 --> 22:59.774
He's just so weird.

22:59.808 --> 23:01.309
Hey!

23:01.343 --> 23:03.411
A lot of people used to
think that we were weird too.

23:03.445 --> 23:04.746
Remember that?

23:18.687 --> 23:20.722
- So?
- He didn't show.

23:20.756 --> 23:23.291
Rafael came in...

23:23.325 --> 23:25.593
You know, the guy from
the Drop-In Center...

23:25.627 --> 23:27.295
And...

23:27.329 --> 23:29.664
I'm thinking maybe AJ saw me with him

23:29.698 --> 23:33.267
and then ran or maybe he just blew me off.

23:33.302 --> 23:34.268
I don't know.

23:41.677 --> 23:42.643
Answer it.

23:46.715 --> 23:48.583
Hi, Callie.

23:48.617 --> 23:49.650
AJ?

23:49.685 --> 23:51.552
Are... are you okay?

23:51.587 --> 23:52.720
I'm all right.

23:52.755 --> 23:55.523
I... I just wanted to call
and tell you I'm sorry.

23:55.557 --> 23:57.525
I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye.

23:57.559 --> 23:59.527
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, I'm just worried about you.

23:59.561 --> 24:01.429
Is... is Mike really pissed at me?

24:01.463 --> 24:02.630
No, he's just sad, I think.

24:02.664 --> 24:04.565
He misses you. We all do.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.401
Where are you staying?

24:06.435 --> 24:08.436
- You're not on the streets, are you?
- No, no.

24:08.470 --> 24:10.505
We're crashing with some
dudes that Ty knew, but...

24:10.539 --> 24:12.507
it's kinda sketchy.

24:14.353 --> 24:15.520
Please come home, AJ.

24:15.554 --> 24:17.388
I can't.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.457
I can't do that to Ty.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.392
Look, I gotta go.

24:21.427 --> 24:22.493
They don't know that

24:22.528 --> 24:24.329
I'm using their phone
for a long-distance call.

24:24.363 --> 24:25.430
Wait, long distance?

24:25.464 --> 24:26.464
Aren't you in San Diego?

24:26.498 --> 24:27.465
No.

24:27.499 --> 24:30.435
No, but the email address you've been using

24:30.469 --> 24:32.403
on Fost and Found is from here.

24:32.438 --> 24:34.272
I haven't been on Fost and Found.

24:35.441 --> 24:37.275
- But we've been IMing.
- No, I don't know

24:37.309 --> 24:39.243
who you've been talking
to, but it's not me.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.411
Look, Callie, I gotta go. Take care.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.316
What did he say?

24:46.418 --> 24:48.319
That wasn't AJ on Fost and Found.

24:48.354 --> 24:51.189
- You got catfished?
- I guess.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.223
Where is he? Did he say?

24:52.257 --> 24:53.658
No.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.326
What are you gonna do?

24:59.264 --> 25:01.132
It's an Arizona area code

25:01.166 --> 25:03.167
and I think it's a landline.

25:04.636 --> 25:07.138
He sounds like he really
wants to come home.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.173
I'm just afraid that if
he stays with his brother,

25:09.208 --> 25:10.608
he's gonna get in some real trouble.

25:10.642 --> 25:12.610
Well, you did the right
thing, Callie. You really did.

25:12.644 --> 25:14.245
Okay?

25:14.279 --> 25:16.180
So what next?

25:16.215 --> 25:18.616
Well, hopefully we'll trace
this back to an address

25:18.650 --> 25:21.586
and, um... and then we go get him.

25:27.553 --> 25:30.490
I'm leaving tonight to assist
the Phoenix PD with the arrest.

25:30.496 --> 25:33.431
Stef, please. Let me go in first,

25:33.465 --> 25:34.432
talk to AJ into coming back

25:34.466 --> 25:36.434
on his own, before the arrest.

25:36.468 --> 25:37.468
He doesn't deserve to go to prison

25:37.503 --> 25:39.404
for just standing by his brother.

25:39.438 --> 25:41.406
I'm not risking Ty running again.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.507
I made that mistake last time.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.108
Come on! What about Brandon?

25:44.143 --> 25:45.543
How many times has he messed
up and we let him off the hook?

25:45.577 --> 25:47.378
Do not equate Brandon's mistakes

25:47.413 --> 25:49.514
with AJ protecting the driver
that almost killed my children!

25:49.548 --> 25:51.482
Honey, maybe Mike has a point.

25:51.517 --> 25:54.319
Think about what this
could do to AJ's future.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.353
Lena, you know that

25:55.387 --> 25:58.289
I always take your opinion seriously.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.425
I do, especially lately,

26:00.459 --> 26:03.328
but this is not open for a discussion.

26:03.362 --> 26:04.462
Mike, you don't have to be a part of this.

26:06.115 --> 26:07.215
It won't fall on you.

26:07.249 --> 26:09.117
I can take care of this.

26:17.226 --> 26:20.061
Mariana, Jude, get down
here. You'll be late.

26:20.095 --> 26:22.230
So you're having auditions for R & J?

26:22.264 --> 26:26.100
Uh... yeah, but Mat's playing Romeo,

26:26.135 --> 26:28.102
so don't even think about it.

26:28.137 --> 26:30.138
Don't worry, I don't want
to be in your stupid musical.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.073
I'm not gonna have time
when I'm Class President.

26:32.107 --> 26:34.042
Wow. Cocky.

26:34.076 --> 26:35.176
Not cocky, confident.

26:35.211 --> 26:37.045
And why shouldn't she be?

26:37.079 --> 26:38.179
Thank you, Mama.

26:38.214 --> 26:40.148
Do you know what time
you'll have the results?

26:40.182 --> 26:43.151
Well, everyone votes at
lunch, and we should have

26:43.185 --> 26:45.954
the results tallied by the end of today.

26:45.988 --> 26:47.055
Hey, where's Mom?

26:47.089 --> 26:49.023
She went to go get AJ.

26:51.994 --> 26:53.928
He called me. He's in Arizona.

26:56.966 --> 26:58.066
With his brother?

26:58.100 --> 26:59.100
Yeah, I think so.

27:49.385 --> 27:52.320
Yeah, it was... it was... it was great.

27:52.354 --> 27:54.289
We'll let you know really soon.

27:54.323 --> 27:55.356
Okay.

27:58.360 --> 28:01.195
Well, it looks like we found our Juliet.

28:01.230 --> 28:03.197
Come on, dude.

28:03.232 --> 28:05.199
Sometimes you just gotta suck it up

28:05.234 --> 28:07.101
and do the right thing.

28:10.339 --> 28:13.141
Uh, what... what are you doing here?

28:13.175 --> 28:14.175
I'm auditioning.

28:14.209 --> 28:16.210
It's open auditions, right?

28:18.147 --> 28:20.148
Um... right,

28:20.182 --> 28:22.150
but aren't you gonna be, like, too busy

28:22.184 --> 28:24.252
with Junior Class President and all that?

28:24.286 --> 28:25.253
I lost.

28:25.287 --> 28:28.022
The results haven't been
announced yet, but...

28:28.057 --> 28:29.190
Mama gave me a heads-up.

28:29.224 --> 28:31.059
Lexi won.

28:31.093 --> 28:33.261
So, now that I have plenty of time,

28:33.295 --> 28:37.031
I'd really like a chance...

28:37.066 --> 28:39.167
just a shot at being in your show.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.137
Um...

28:43.172 --> 28:45.039
okay.

28:45.074 --> 28:47.075
Yeah. Let's... let's start with the chorus.

So we will, uh...

29:32.388 --> 29:33.921
- we will...
- We'll get back to you.

29:43.966 --> 29:44.966
No.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.367
No way.

29:46.402 --> 29:47.935
Come on, dude.

29:47.970 --> 29:50.338
Sometimes you just gotta suck it up

29:50.372 --> 29:51.339
and do the right thing.

30:00.249 --> 30:02.183
Hey, Mariana, wait!

30:02.217 --> 30:04.252
Look...

30:04.286 --> 30:05.253
um...

30:05.287 --> 30:08.356
If you don't want me
to be in your musical...

30:08.390 --> 30:09.357
that's okay.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.259
You can say it.

30:12.294 --> 30:14.228
I don't want you in my musical.

30:17.199 --> 30:18.199
Okay.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.268
I don't want you in my musical, but...

30:20.302 --> 30:23.271
you were hands down the best Juliet.

30:24.406 --> 30:27.308
So... would you...

30:29.178 --> 30:30.244
be in my musical?

30:35.217 --> 30:36.284
Hey.

30:38.153 --> 30:39.253
Hi.

30:39.288 --> 30:41.089
Look, I...

30:41.123 --> 30:43.157
I wanted to apologize for what I said.

30:43.192 --> 30:47.128
It's okay if you don't want
to hang out with me anymore.

30:47.162 --> 30:48.196
That's not it.

30:48.230 --> 30:51.099
It feels like you don't
want to hang out with me.

30:51.133 --> 30:52.266
I mean, whenever you come over,

30:52.301 --> 30:54.202
all you want to do is play video games.

30:54.236 --> 30:55.236
That's not true.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.005
I really like you.

30:59.074 --> 31:00.208
I'm sorry. I've...

31:00.242 --> 31:02.977
never really had friends before.

31:05.180 --> 31:07.115
And I like being here.

31:08.183 --> 31:09.984
You're so lucky.

31:10.018 --> 31:11.953
I wish...

31:11.987 --> 31:13.121
I wish I could have a family like this.

31:13.155 --> 31:14.122
It'll happen.

31:14.156 --> 31:16.090
No, it won't.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.025
Not for me.

31:18.060 --> 31:19.961
I know I'm weird.

31:19.995 --> 31:21.129
That's why no one's ever adopted me

31:21.163 --> 31:23.030
and why they never will.

31:23.065 --> 31:25.399
Look, I used to think the same thing,

31:25.434 --> 31:26.934
but look at me now.

31:26.969 --> 31:28.936
Just don't give up.

31:28.971 --> 31:30.104
Come on. Let's go play Clash of Clans.

31:30.139 --> 31:32.006
Can we play the racing game?

31:35.444 --> 31:37.378
- Hi. Ready?
- Yeah.

31:41.083 --> 31:43.951
Listen, um...

31:43.986 --> 31:45.286
does AJ know that Mom's coming to get him?

31:46.388 --> 31:47.955
No.

31:47.990 --> 31:49.357
I can tell he wants to come home.

31:49.391 --> 31:52.360
He just doesn't have the heart
to leave his brother, you know?

31:54.396 --> 31:56.264
So you... you made the decision for him.

31:57.366 --> 32:00.234
Um, except th... there's
something you don't know.

32:02.971 --> 32:04.372
Mom and my dad think that Ty

32:04.406 --> 32:08.209
was the one driving the car
that hit Ana and the twins...

32:08.243 --> 32:10.344
which means...

32:10.379 --> 32:14.248
AJ is helping a criminal.

32:14.283 --> 32:17.218
So, if they find him with Ty...

32:17.252 --> 32:18.920
he could get in a lot more trouble

32:18.954 --> 32:20.321
than for just running away.

32:25.394 --> 32:28.162
- Um, I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

32:37.272 --> 32:38.306
Hello?

32:38.340 --> 32:40.208
AJ? It's Callie.

32:47.282 --> 32:49.083
Ty, is that you?

32:59.261 --> 33:02.029
- What'd you tell Callie?
- Nothing, I swear.

33:02.064 --> 33:05.032
Get your stuff. We're leaving. Now!

33:06.235 --> 33:07.168
Come on! Move!

33:10.105 --> 33:11.105
I'm not goin'.

33:11.139 --> 33:12.173
What?

33:12.207 --> 33:15.142
I can't. I can't run anymore.

33:15.177 --> 33:17.078
I'm sorry, Ty.

33:17.112 --> 33:19.180
You go.

33:19.214 --> 33:20.248
It's okay.

33:26.088 --> 33:28.089
Police! Open up!

33:34.263 --> 33:36.097
- Tyrone Hensdale?
- That's me.

33:36.131 --> 33:37.164
We have a warrant for your arrest.

33:37.199 --> 33:39.033
Both hands on your head,
please, and turn around.

33:39.067 --> 33:40.101
Sir, hands behind your back.

33:48.210 --> 33:50.077
AJ, we're arresting your brother

33:50.112 --> 33:51.178
because he was involved in the hit and run

33:51.213 --> 33:53.047
that injured Mariana and Jesus.

33:53.081 --> 33:55.049
Now, I know you knew nothing about that,

33:55.083 --> 33:57.018
but we're gonna have to

33:57.052 --> 33:59.053
take you in for running away, all right?

33:59.087 --> 34:00.087
Let's go.

34:46.621 --> 34:48.188
When you get done

34:48.223 --> 34:49.523
with that nail, that sure will...

34:50.659 --> 34:51.625
Thanks, man.

34:55.630 --> 34:57.164
Excuse me.

34:59.601 --> 35:00.501
Excuse me.

35:02.203 --> 35:04.138
Hey, are you Gabriel?

35:04.172 --> 35:07.107
No. That's Gabriel over there.

35:09.544 --> 35:10.544
Who wants to know?

35:12.514 --> 35:14.181
Uh, somebody told me to talk

35:14.215 --> 35:15.549
to him about getting a job here.

35:15.584 --> 35:16.550
How old are you?

35:16.585 --> 35:18.118
18.

35:18.153 --> 35:19.520
Okay.

35:19.554 --> 35:21.522
We could use the help today.

35:21.556 --> 35:24.191
It pays 10 bucks an hour
in cash, under the table.

35:24.225 --> 35:25.492
Go help Gabriel.

35:40.475 --> 35:41.442
Hey.

35:43.178 --> 35:46.447
Uh, that guy said I was
supposed to help you.

35:48.650 --> 35:50.551
All right. Grab the other side.

36:09.537 --> 36:10.537
Why didn't you tell me

36:10.572 --> 36:13.474
that Ty was the driver from the accident?

36:13.508 --> 36:15.409
I couldn't, Callie.

36:15.443 --> 36:19.380
So is AJ gonna be charged
with, like, a crime now?

36:19.414 --> 36:20.581
- I don't think so. No.
- So what's gonna happen?

36:20.615 --> 36:24.351
They're gonna bring him
back to San Diego and he's...

36:24.386 --> 36:25.419
And he'll go to juvie.

36:27.622 --> 36:29.456
I should have never said anything.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.392
I think that he'll see

36:31.426 --> 36:33.327
you're just trying to
be a good friend, Cal.

36:39.467 --> 36:42.302
Uh...

36:44.539 --> 36:48.375
I warned AJ to, uh, to play dumb about Ty,

36:48.410 --> 36:50.477
so I think that if he keeps quiet,

36:50.512 --> 36:51.445
he'll be fine.

36:53.448 --> 36:57.217
I'm, uh, sorry for snapping before I left.

36:57.252 --> 36:58.385
What did you mean when you said you'd been

36:58.420 --> 37:01.288
taking my, my opinions to heart lately?

37:02.424 --> 37:05.225
Does this have to do with the mastectomy?

37:05.260 --> 37:06.627
Because I thought you agreed

37:06.661 --> 37:09.296
you weren't going to do something
so radical if you didn't have to.

37:31.152 --> 37:32.186
Look.

37:41.229 --> 37:42.296
Does this mean...

37:42.330 --> 37:44.231
It probably means...

37:44.265 --> 37:48.102
it's not a question of if I get cancer...

37:48.136 --> 37:49.203
it's a question of when.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.181
Having the BRCA 1 gene increases my chances

38:01.216 --> 38:05.152
of getting breast cancer, invasive
breast cancer, at some point.

38:05.186 --> 38:10.057
So, since I have DCIS,

38:10.091 --> 38:15.129
I think I don't want to take any chances.

38:15.163 --> 38:18.198
I think I do want to
get a double mastectomy.

38:24.139 --> 38:26.106
My baby...

38:27.175 --> 38:29.109
What can I do?

38:31.246 --> 38:32.212
Stay.

38:34.182 --> 38:36.116
I think I'm gonna need you.

38:38.219 --> 38:40.154
I'll be right here.

38:40.188 --> 38:41.188
I'm not going anywhere.

38:46.127 --> 38:47.428
Thanks, Mom.

39:17.492 --> 39:19.026
Uh, listen, I...

39:19.060 --> 39:22.029
I think as soon as the RV is fixed...

39:22.063 --> 39:25.032
I think you should go on the trip.

39:28.036 --> 39:29.470
I'll stay here.

39:31.506 --> 39:33.173
Stef needs me.

39:36.478 --> 39:38.011
Yeah.

39:38.046 --> 39:39.113
Okay.

39:40.312 --> 39:42.913
I'll head out first thing in the morning.

39:46.318 --> 39:47.318
It's fixed?

39:47.352 --> 39:49.286
It was never broken.

39:49.321 --> 39:51.956
Listen, I didn't want
you to leave your daughter

39:51.990 --> 39:52.990
in the middle of a fight, you know?

39:55.060 --> 39:56.961
Oh, you!

39:59.898 --> 40:01.332
What do you see in me?

40:01.366 --> 40:03.934
A woman 10 years older than you...

40:03.969 --> 40:06.303
I see a beautiful woman

40:06.338 --> 40:08.305
with a spirit 10 years younger than me.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.976
Are you saying I'm immature?

40:14.346 --> 40:15.946
I'm saying this isn't a fling.

40:17.382 --> 40:18.882
At least not for me.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.885
And I'll go on my trip...

40:25.357 --> 40:27.324
but I'll be back to get you.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.894
Whenever you're ready.

40:58.356 --> 41:01.589
_

41:01.893 --> 41:03.811
_

41:10.035 --> 41:13.050
_

41:13.351 --> 41:15.351
_

41:19.377 --> 41:21.011
Done?

41:21.046 --> 41:23.013
Uh, yeah. Thanks.

41:23.048 --> 41:24.882
You wanna play another game?
