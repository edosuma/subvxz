00:01.084 --> 00:02.294
Previously on
Cruel Summer...

00:02.294 --> 00:05.047
No pressure, but...

00:05.047 --> 00:07.132
I thought maybe
if you're ready...

00:07.132 --> 00:08.884
Yeah.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.969
-I broke up with Luke.
-You what?

00:10.969 --> 00:12.846
Isabella: One look at you
and he'll realize

00:12.846 --> 00:15.015
that what he wants
has been in front of him
this whole time.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.562
Everyone already believes
that they saw me
on that tape with Luke.

00:20.562 --> 00:23.607
-Yeah, but...
-So let's make sure
that it stays that way.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.109
Something happened
at the Plunge today.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.694
Okay, you're kind
of freaking me out.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.404
What happened?

00:29.404 --> 00:30.989
She kissed me.

00:30.989 --> 00:34.493
I can handle
both of them, no problem.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.828
Okay, I've got them
wrapped around my finger.

00:36.828 --> 00:40.999
I busted a major move
with Isabella after the Plunge,
and she couldn't get enough.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.626
Megan: He's not gonna
get away with this.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.169
Back when Luke
first disappeared,

00:44.169 --> 00:46.797
you were ready to leave town
the moment school ended.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.633
Isabella: But Debbie got sick
so I decided to stay
and help out.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.760
(computer chimes)

00:51.760 --> 00:53.595
Megan: Have you always
had those cameras,

00:53.595 --> 00:55.180
looking out towards the road?

00:55.180 --> 00:56.848
I never lied about us.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.643
I tried to be a better friend
to you than I was to Lisa.

00:59.643 --> 01:02.229
That's why I pretended to be
the one on the sex tape.

01:02.229 --> 01:06.191
Even after everything
that happened on New Year's Eve,
I had your back.

01:06.191 --> 01:10.195
Did you, or were you
just covering your ass
after what you did?

01:10.195 --> 01:13.657
I think that you went back
to the cabin on New Year's

01:13.657 --> 01:14.825
and you killed Luke.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.954
I just heard something
that I think you should know.

01:18.954 --> 01:22.457
-What are you thinking?
-I want to make Luke
wish he'd never met us.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.752
all:
Happy New Year! Whoo!

01:25.752 --> 01:27.212
(cheering)

01:27.212 --> 01:29.464
Why don't we go back
to the cabin and celebrate?

01:29.464 --> 01:31.341
Just the two of us? Hmm?

01:31.341 --> 01:33.760
Yeah, let's go.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.097

01:55.073 --> 01:57.367
Nine Days: ♪ This is the story

01:57.367 --> 02:00.412
It was perfect, even better
than I thought it would be.

02:00.412 --> 02:03.081
I'm so glad.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.083
Thank you.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.294
For what?

02:07.294 --> 02:09.296
Um, everything?

02:09.296 --> 02:12.424
This never would've happened
if it wasn't for you.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.051
Please.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.720
You and Luke were, like,
destined to be together.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.388
I was just your love sherpa.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.140
(Megan giggles)

02:22.934 --> 02:24.978
You're the best friend
I could ever have.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.480
I feel so lucky.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.023
Me too.

02:28.023 --> 02:30.233
(car driving up)

02:30.233 --> 02:32.986
That's him! (giggles)

I wanna try something different.

02:52.089 --> 02:55.175
Different?
What do you mean, different?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.718
What? (laughing)

03:01.682 --> 03:04.309
Wow, uh...

03:04.309 --> 03:08.730
I just figured, y'know,
since the world is ending...

03:08.730 --> 03:11.483
this could be our last chance.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.110
(laughs)

03:13.110 --> 03:15.404
Whatever chatroom
gave you this idea,

03:15.404 --> 03:17.447
I offer my sincere gratitude.

03:18.824 --> 03:19.991
Come on.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.036
(keying rapidly)

03:23.036 --> 03:24.788
(computer chimes)

03:27.457 --> 03:28.959
(chimes)

03:33.463 --> 03:34.381
We need to talk.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.719
What are you doing here?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.847
Sheriff Myer called my lawyer.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.306
He knows about our lie.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.936
(electronic squelching)

03:53.275 --> 03:54.860
Which one?

03:54.860 --> 03:56.403
That you're the one on the tape.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.363
Who told him?

03:58.363 --> 04:00.365
What, did you cut a deal
for yourself or something?

04:00.365 --> 04:03.118
No. No, the truth makes me look
just as bad as you.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.661
(sighs)

04:04.661 --> 04:06.538
Look, I don't know how
he found out,

04:06.538 --> 04:09.124
but all that matters
is that he did.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.710
Well, we have bigger problems.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.753
Steve thinks
that Ned killed Luke.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.714
He's got the cops looking
into him and everything.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.883
That just takes the heat off us,
doesn't it?

04:17.883 --> 04:19.968
Not exactly.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.971
Ned has a ton
of security cameras right
outside of his house.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.973
One of them looks out
on the road,

04:24.973 --> 04:28.477
the one that forks to his house
and the Chambers' cabin.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.353
Were they filming
on New Year's Eve?

04:30.353 --> 04:32.981
They're always filming. 24/7.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.359
If the cops find that footage...

04:36.359 --> 04:38.612
I know. That's why we have
to get it before they do.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.071
I'm headed over
to Ned's right now.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.740
Not without me you're not.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.331
(giggling)

04:49.331 --> 04:51.500
Hey, you're early.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.586
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I couldn't wait. (laughs)

04:54.586 --> 04:56.171
Cool.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.590
Uh, I'll just grab my stuff
and then I'll be ready.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.426
Um, actually, uh, Luke
and I were maybe

05:01.426 --> 05:03.303
gonna hang out for a bit
before the car wash.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.930
Upstairs.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.139
Oh.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.307
You don't mind, do you?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.768
No. No, of course not.

05:09.768 --> 05:10.894
Take your time.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.321
-(sighs)
-(door opens)

05:21.321 --> 05:23.073
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.868
Where are Megan and Luke?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.495
I saw his car outside.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.955
They're upstairs.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.456
Oh.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.334
So are they... together now?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.127
I think so.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.921
Debbie: Ah, it's not
that big of a surprise.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.173
They've been close
since they were little.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.844
You doing okay?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.929
Yeah.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.306
Yeah, of course.
I'm really happy for them.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.724
I just, um...

05:49.724 --> 05:51.476
don't totally know
where I fit in.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.687
Right alongside Megan still.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.480
Plus, school's starting soon.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.817
Yeah. Yeah, you're right,
I'm excited.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.152
Not about the homework part,
but, um...

06:01.152 --> 06:04.573
the football games,
the pep rallies--

06:04.573 --> 06:06.825
I didn't have any of that
at boarding school.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.994
I'm guessing no car wash either.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.412
Nope.

06:10.412 --> 06:13.248
You should head over.
See what it's all about.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.541
I think I will.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.502
Hey.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.337
Listen, you're gonna have
a terrific senior year.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.970
Steve Chambers
has been all over me.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.097
He's convinced Ned Faunce
killed Luke.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.224
I'm not sure
I'm buying it, but...

06:31.224 --> 06:33.894
there's definitely something
going on between him
and Megan Landry.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.771
Think it's criminal?

06:36.771 --> 06:38.732
Well, six months ago
I would've said no.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.901
But now I wouldn't
put anything past her.

06:40.901 --> 06:44.487
Or Isabella.
They've been lying
about the sex tape for months.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.407
Puts a whole new light
on their relationship,
on all their statements.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.746
Have you finished going through
Jeff Pope's footage
from the party?

06:52.746 --> 06:55.081
Still in it. Uh...

06:55.081 --> 06:57.584
So far, there's been nothing
worth mentioning with the girls.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.336
Yeah, keep looking.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.963
If they've conspired
about the tape all this time,

07:01.963 --> 07:03.506

Weird?

07:37.666 --> 07:39.668
Dude, I've seen you in diapers.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.503
Yeah, when I was, like, two.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.254
Well, yeah. Thank God.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.757
(giggling) No!

07:47.759 --> 07:48.968

07:48.968 --> 07:51.638

Uncharted territory?

08:08.321 --> 08:09.531
Uh-huh.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.327

I'm so glad that I waited,

08:28.425 --> 08:30.635
you know, that we get
to be each other's first.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.470

so much more special.

a lot more than that.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.095
(straining)

09:16.848 --> 09:20.810
Should we have, like...
should we have a safe word?

09:20.810 --> 09:22.979
What's that?

09:22.979 --> 09:25.190
It's like, uh,
it's a word that you pick

09:25.190 --> 09:29.277
so that, you know, if things
start getting too intense

09:29.277 --> 09:32.906
and someone wants to stop,
you can say it.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.408

something like "Lasagna."

09:38.453 --> 09:39.913
"Control-alt-delete"?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.958
(laughs) You got it.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.335
I'll try to be gentle.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.212
Not too gentle.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.013
Just try to relax.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.732
What the...?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.364
-Whoo!

Parker:
Hey, boys.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.250
Jeff: All right, all right.
This is our senior
kickoff event.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.835

what it's about.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.586
Washing cars, yo!

10:28.586 --> 10:30.755
We're seniors now,
we rule the school!

10:30.755 --> 10:32.549
-Whoo!
-Yay!

10:32.549 --> 10:34.050
Leave the dirty work to us

10:34.050 --> 10:36.761
and come support
the class of 2000!

10:36.761 --> 10:39.347
-(cheering)
-We're wet and wild!

10:39.347 --> 10:41.808
Hey! Yo, Isabella,
you wanna get wet?

10:41.808 --> 10:45.603
Um... only if it's for charity.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.063
Which I guess is you.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.440
-Eric: Ooh!
-Uh, but still, nah.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.609
I'm good.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.695
Wow, Tim and his limp hose.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.446
-Ooh!
-Come on,
let's get you a bucket.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.824
-Watch out, bro...
-Bye.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.242
girl:
Hey, guys!

10:59.242 --> 11:03.705
(indistinct chatter)

11:03.705 --> 11:06.249
-Nice sign.
-Thank you.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.834
More cars means more money,

11:07.834 --> 11:10.044
and we definitely need it
for homecoming, so...

11:10.044 --> 11:11.796
What happens
if we don't raise enough?

11:11.796 --> 11:15.008
Then we're stuck having it
at our smelly gym.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.010
Let's make it rain, then.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.180
Damn girl, okay!

11:20.180 --> 11:22.348
Uh... Wait, where is Megan?

11:22.348 --> 11:24.642
She's with Luke.
They'll be here a little later.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.770
Oh. Wow, that's kind of weird,
not seeing you with her.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.606
You guys are, like,
attached at the hip.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.482
Except, now we're not.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.655
It's the new normal,
get used to it.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.240
Okay.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.159
-Is Brent coming?
-No.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.870
No, you are not the only one
who's Chambers-free now.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.748
I just kicked him
to the curb yesterday.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.249
-Finally.
-(laughs)

11:48.249 --> 11:49.709
Freedom looks good on you, girl.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.835
Thank you.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.670
Okay, let's do this thing.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.339
(giggles)

11:54.339 --> 11:55.924
-All right.
-Let's do this.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.342
All right,
you ready to get wet?

11:57.342 --> 11:59.844
Yes.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.138
Fun fact:
I've never done this before...

12:02.138 --> 12:04.974
♪ Baby, I'm ready to roll ♪

12:04.974 --> 12:10.396
Okay, okay.
Okay, what's going on?

12:10.396 --> 12:12.357
Wh-Why is she here?

12:12.357 --> 12:14.234
We need to talk.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.568
About what?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.111
The Plunge.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.655
Megan, I-- look, I told you--

12:18.655 --> 12:21.616
You both told me what happened
and your versions don't line up.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.662
I love you guys.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.206
I just want to know the truth
so we can all move forward.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.874
Okay, well, are you gonna
tie her up too?

12:29.874 --> 12:31.584
I'm sure you'd love that,
wouldn't you?

12:33.461 --> 12:34.671
Damn it!

12:34.671 --> 12:36.172
Isabella:
Stop fighting, Luke.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.341
It's not gonna help, okay?

12:38.341 --> 12:40.134
Try to relax.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.929
It would be a lot easier
if you just untied me, okay?

12:42.929 --> 12:46.641
-So not happening.
-Okay, both of you, chill.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.769
I'm gonna make us all
some drinks,

12:49.769 --> 12:51.813
and then we can get
to the bottom of this.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.242
He's so nervous.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.411
Not for long.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.705
Luke:
(straining) Come on! Guys!

13:10.915 --> 13:12.458
Guys, can you please
let me out?

13:17.755 --> 13:20.133
Guys!

13:20.133 --> 13:21.884
-Guys, seriously,
it's not funny.
-Voilà.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.845
-Truth serum.
-Luke: Please.

13:23.845 --> 13:27.181
And liquid courage for us.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.976
Luke: Okay? Look,
it's not funny anymore.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.311
(pouring drink)

13:39.152 --> 13:40.320
Um...

13:42.030 --> 13:43.531
Luke:
Come on, let me out.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.367
Guys!

13:46.367 --> 13:48.953
One more... for good measure.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.288
Luke:
Come on!

13:51.789 --> 13:52.749
There.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.002
You gotta be kidding me.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.336
(Megan sighs)

14:06.179 --> 14:08.264
I'm already pretty drunk.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.849
Uh, drink.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.435
How?

14:12.435 --> 14:14.479
Oh, don't worry.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.813
We gotcha.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.076
Cheers.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.590
(doorbell buzzes)

14:49.680 --> 14:51.891
Wait, he gave you
his security code?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.434
I watched him punch it in once.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.812
I think I remember
how his fingers moved.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.022
(alarm chirps)

14:58.022 --> 14:59.941
Isabella:
Impressive.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.738
Okay, this way.

15:14.205 --> 15:17.250
(sighs) I don't know how
he labelled the outside cameras
or where he put them.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.585
They're not in the same folder
as the interior ones.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.255
Well, yeah.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.465
I mean, I'm just saying,
if I were hella paranoid,

15:24.465 --> 15:26.300
I'd put them somewhere
completely unlikely.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.094
Like with my taxes,

15:28.094 --> 15:29.846
or in a totally different
database, right?

15:31.597 --> 15:33.182
That's actually really smart.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.809
(Megan keying)

15:34.809 --> 15:37.145
You could be less surprised.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.564
Reading people
is like my superpower.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.732
You do have a talent for it.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.362
I expected this place
to be way more creepy.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.948
(keying continues)

15:48.948 --> 15:51.534
Why'd you, um...

15:51.534 --> 15:53.578
Why'd you hide your...

15:53.578 --> 15:55.538
whatever it was with Ned?

15:55.538 --> 15:58.499
You really think you're in
a place to be comparing secrets?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.086
(stops keying)

16:04.714 --> 16:07.633
When I first started
working with Ned,

16:07.633 --> 16:09.969
the tape had just happened

16:09.969 --> 16:13.848
and me and you were at eleven,
like, all the time.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.226
It was...

16:17.226 --> 16:19.145
it was a lot.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.439
I think that...

16:21.439 --> 16:24.984
I wanted something
that was just mine.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.152
Separate.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.403
Yeah.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.991
I would've let you have it.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.618
Or...

16:33.618 --> 16:36.162
whatever, but...

16:36.162 --> 16:38.706
lying about it
made it so much worse.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.756
Oh, here we go.
I think I found something.

16:46.756 --> 16:47.924
Me too.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.849
Hey.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.727
(Third Eye Blind playing
"I Want Something Else")

17:01.771 --> 17:04.273
Yo! I've been dyin'
to see this!

17:04.273 --> 17:06.192
My sister says
it's really funny!

17:06.192 --> 17:07.902
Hey, if anybody asks,
it wasn't me, all right?

17:07.902 --> 17:08.861
Yeah, for sure.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.452
I wanna join
the social committee,

17:16.452 --> 17:18.120
help plan parties.

17:18.120 --> 17:21.707
And don't laugh, but I'm
super stoked to have a locker.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.751
Oh, my God.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.503
You know,
you're like a low-key dork.

17:25.503 --> 17:28.297
No. I just...
I love to decorate stuff.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.675
Okay, well, seniors get
way more than just lockers.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.969
I mean, we're like
the rock stars of the school,

17:32.969 --> 17:34.136
and, like,
everyone looks up to us.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.476
I'm really sorry
for being such a bitch to you
when you first got here.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.144
You were?

17:42.144 --> 17:44.480
I hadn't noticed.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.566
Smile!

17:46.566 --> 17:48.818
(camera shutter clicks)

17:48.818 --> 17:50.611
Hey!

17:50.611 --> 17:52.405
Oh, hey, check it out.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.866
Tim: Landry and Chambers,
finally doing the deed?

17:55.866 --> 17:57.243
Uh...

17:57.243 --> 17:59.078
Isn't that, like, awkward?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.705
No.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.540
Not at all.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.042
I'm, like, legit happy for them.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.882
My experience,
three can be tricky.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.801
Kinda ends up, like,
two against one.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.886
Yeah.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.264
But, hey, uh, senior year's
all about having fun...

18:18.264 --> 18:19.932
-Mm-hmm.
-...playing the field.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.351
Yes, and I am so down
to be your wing woman.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.353
Hell yeah.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.106
(laughing)

18:27.106 --> 18:29.650
Hey! How's it going?

18:29.650 --> 18:30.985
Wet and wild.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.403
(laughing)

18:32.403 --> 18:34.113
The soap and buckets
are over there.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.906
Okay. Cool. Be right back.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.416
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.376
What do you do
with all your footage?

18:47.376 --> 18:50.963
Well, I'm making
a video time capsule.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.300
So we start in senior year,

18:54.300 --> 18:56.594
then we talk about our goals
for the year.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.847
And we see how much has changed
by next summer.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.768
So...

19:03.768 --> 19:07.229
what does Isabella LaRue
want to get out of this year?

19:07.229 --> 19:10.775
Well, it is my first and last

19:10.775 --> 19:12.568
American high-school
experience.

19:12.568 --> 19:16.864
So... good friends
and good times.

19:16.864 --> 19:20.242
I wanna go hard,
leave it all out on the table.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.119
I have no doubt that you will.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.163
Luke:
Oh!

19:24.163 --> 19:26.666
(indistinct chatter)

19:26.666 --> 19:28.084
(Megan laughing)

19:28.084 --> 19:31.629
Megan:
No, no, no, no. Stop! Stop!

19:31.629 --> 19:34.340
There's nothing that
you could've done, you know?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.678
They were kinda inevitable.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.680
(music volume swells)

19:42.973 --> 19:44.809
(music fades)

19:44.809 --> 19:46.852
It's go time.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.688
Before he falls asleep.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.781
Wakey, wakey. (echoing)

20:07.665 --> 20:09.500
Isabella,
what did you tell Megan?

20:09.500 --> 20:11.043
The truth.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.880
Megan...

20:19.635 --> 20:22.680
Megan, what are you...
what are you doing with that?

20:22.680 --> 20:23.973
What do you think?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.683
You-you-you...

20:25.683 --> 20:27.184
you want to film me?

20:27.184 --> 20:29.311
What happened between you
and Isabella at the Plunge?

20:29.311 --> 20:32.231
-I told you, we kissed.
-I thought she kissed you?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.483
See, what I remember is
you kissing me

20:34.483 --> 20:35.735
and then me pushing you away.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.446
(sighs)

20:40.698 --> 20:43.659
Yeah, okay...
Maybe it was more on me, yeah.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.536
But it didn't--
it didn't mean anything.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.037
So you lied.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.957
And blamed Isabella
so you wouldn't look bad.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.251
Yes. Yeah.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.961
Yeah, but, Megan, I didn't...

20:53.961 --> 20:56.672
I just-- I didn't
want to hurt you.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.507
Okay? I didn't want you
to be mad.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.426
And I know what I did
was shitty,

21:00.426 --> 21:04.013
but I didn't want you
looking at me the way
that you are right now.

21:04.013 --> 21:07.516
What other bullshit
have you told people about us?

21:07.516 --> 21:11.061
And before you lie,
remember we're
"wrapped around your finger."

21:11.061 --> 21:13.522
That's not
what it sounds like.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.484
Ever since the sex tape, you've
acted like you've had our back,

21:16.484 --> 21:18.360
but in reality,
you've just been bragging

21:18.360 --> 21:20.404
about what a stud you are,
haven't you?

21:20.404 --> 21:22.156
-Haven't you?
-Yeah, yes.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.657
But I didn't mean it.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.534
I wanted to sound cool.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.537
I know that that's
dumb, but...

21:28.537 --> 21:30.539
Come on, Megan, come on.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.082
You know me.
You know me, Megan.

21:32.082 --> 21:35.336
You know that I...
I'm not that guy.

21:35.336 --> 21:38.088
I don't know
who you are anymore.

21:38.088 --> 21:41.300
Just... Just tell us
everything you've said.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.928
What are you...

21:43.928 --> 21:45.554
What're you gonna do
with this?

21:45.554 --> 21:47.473
Give you a taste
of your own medicine.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.475
You're gonna confess
all your sins,

21:49.475 --> 21:52.186
and we're gonna make sure
everyone in town sees it.

21:52.186 --> 21:55.523
My dad's gonna murder me.
Please. Please.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.900
You don't seem to understand
what we've been through

21:57.900 --> 22:00.861
because of that stupid tape.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.322
But you will.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.782
Start talking.

22:06.534 --> 22:07.827
What else have you done?

22:21.048 --> 22:22.675
-Debbie.
-It's not a good time, Steve.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.677
Debbie, please, please, please!

22:24.677 --> 22:27.763
Did you know...

22:27.763 --> 22:30.391
that it was Megan on that tape,
not Isabella?

22:30.391 --> 22:33.561
It was private,
between the girls.

22:33.561 --> 22:36.564
Uh-huh. I didn't think
we were hiding things
from each other back then.

22:36.564 --> 22:39.108
-I guess I was wrong.
-Except for Brent's
tape collection.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.985
I was protecting my son.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.362
-And I was
protecting my daughter.
-Yeah, Megan I understand.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.281
What about Isabella?

22:45.281 --> 22:48.325
I'm the reason she's here.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.744
The entire town
turned their backs on her

22:50.744 --> 22:52.079
the minute that tape played.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.789
No one was looking out for her.

22:53.789 --> 22:57.418
Baby, I'm just trying
to get justice for Luke.

22:57.418 --> 22:58.836
Of course you are.

22:58.836 --> 23:00.588
But I am not gonna
let Megan go down

23:00.588 --> 23:02.172
for a crime she didn't commit.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.591
You sound so sure of that.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.553
Can you say the same thing
about Isabella?

23:13.976 --> 23:16.687
You said you were gonna sleep
with both of us at once.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.188
For practice.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.107
For the girls at Branson.
I know.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.692
What else are you lying about?

23:21.692 --> 23:23.652
Nothing. I swear.

23:23.652 --> 23:26.655
The guys egged me on
tonight, okay?

23:26.655 --> 23:28.157
And I was just trying
to sound cool.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.825
Okay, I know that it's stupid,

23:29.825 --> 23:32.036
but I wanted to impress them.

23:32.036 --> 23:35.039
What about Brent's tapes?
Did you watch any of them?

23:35.039 --> 23:36.206
No.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.167
Don't lie!

23:38.167 --> 23:39.335
I didn't mean to.

23:39.335 --> 23:40.628
But?

23:40.628 --> 23:43.547
The guys came over
to the house one day,

23:43.547 --> 23:45.174
and I...

23:45.174 --> 23:47.927
Look, I saw-- I saw a little.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.095
You knew Brent was making tapes?

23:52.222 --> 23:54.141
That's a yes.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.768
Did you know
he was filming them here?

23:57.770 --> 23:59.188
Say it!

23:59.188 --> 24:00.648
To the camera, Luke.

24:00.648 --> 24:03.150
Okay, yes, I knew.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.902
Megan:
(sobbing) Luke!

24:04.902 --> 24:06.445
You...

24:06.445 --> 24:08.989
So you knew Brent
was hiding a camera here

24:08.989 --> 24:10.991
and you still brought me here
and had sex with me?

24:10.991 --> 24:13.118
You let him record us?

24:13.118 --> 24:15.079
No!

24:15.079 --> 24:16.372
You're lying!

24:16.372 --> 24:19.041
No, I'm not! No, I'm not!

24:19.041 --> 24:20.668
I...

24:20.668 --> 24:24.046
Look, Brent doesn't--
He only records himself.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.506
He didn't even record us.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.263
Luke.

24:33.263 --> 24:36.475
If Brent didn't
make the sex tape
between you and Megan...

24:38.435 --> 24:39.687
who did?

24:44.149 --> 24:45.484
I did.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.665
-What's up?
-'Sup?

24:59.665 --> 25:01.083
(Brent sighs)

25:01.083 --> 25:03.377
You will never guess
what I just got.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.671
-An STD?
-(guys laughing)

25:05.671 --> 25:07.256
Nice try, testicle breath.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.967
But no.

25:09.967 --> 25:13.095
I got the
Pam Anderson/Tommy Lee sex tape.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.222
-Booyah!
-I thought that was,
like, banned!

25:15.222 --> 25:16.849
Yeah, more like sold out.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.809
Well, I-I've got connections.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.310
Was it dope?

25:20.310 --> 25:22.521
Oh, it's greater than
you could have ever imagined.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.106
I mean, it is going to be

25:24.106 --> 25:25.691
a killer addition
to my collection.

25:25.691 --> 25:28.652
And because I'm a generous guy,
I will let you borrow it.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.362
For a fee.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.239
Come on, you rule, dude.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.825
You know, homemade porn,

25:34.825 --> 25:37.536
it's like the new frontier,
you know?

25:37.536 --> 25:39.747
'Cause all you need
is a video camera

25:39.747 --> 25:42.249
and you're all good to go.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.710
I mean, well,
you should have good lighting.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.420
Okay, now that right there,
Jeff,

25:46.420 --> 25:51.050
that is why you, my friend,
are going to die virgin.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.509
(guys laughing)

25:52.509 --> 25:56.972
♪ Just a teenage
dirtbag, baby ♪

25:56.972 --> 26:01.477
♪ Yeah, I'm just
a teenage dirtbag, baby ♪

26:14.990 --> 26:16.575
He's ready for you now.

26:23.999 --> 26:27.086
(suspenseful music playing)

26:46.605 --> 26:49.983
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.569
Did you see that slip'n'slide
that Tim rigged?

26:52.569 --> 26:54.113
No.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.698
He wiped out, like, crazy.
It was... it was classic.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.741
(Isabella giggles)

26:59.660 --> 27:01.578
Listen, um...

27:01.578 --> 27:04.456
So, Megan and I were
hanging together,

27:04.456 --> 27:06.375
and she was talking about

27:06.375 --> 27:09.461
us being each other's firsts.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.421
What'd she say?

27:11.421 --> 27:13.590
When you told her that we--

27:13.590 --> 27:16.260
You know, I thought
you'd told her.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.303
You know, but when I realized
that you hadn't...

27:18.303 --> 27:20.639
I was going to.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.267
Then she started telling me
that she had feelings for you.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.060
So... I didn't.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.353
Same.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.065
I don't know, I mean...

27:30.065 --> 27:31.775
You know, I'm kinda
just hoping that

27:31.775 --> 27:34.444
I don't have to tell her,
like, ever.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.238
So you're saying
we should lie to her?

27:38.407 --> 27:40.200
Well...

27:40.200 --> 27:42.369
I-I don't-- I don't want to.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.913
Okay? But... (scoffs)

27:44.913 --> 27:47.749
She was so happy,
you should have seen
the look that was on her face.

27:50.627 --> 27:53.005
I don't know.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.883
She's my best friend.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.427
It feels wrong, not telling her.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.054
She's a lot more
sensitive than she seems.

28:05.267 --> 28:06.476
I guess.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.147
The last thing I want to do
is make her feel bad.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.235
But what if she finds out?

28:15.235 --> 28:16.695
Who's gonna tell her?

28:18.989 --> 28:20.741
Okay.

28:20.741 --> 28:23.368
Cool. It's the right move.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.703
I promise.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.129
Aside from breaking
and entering,

28:34.129 --> 28:36.798
what were you and Megan doing
in Ned Faunce's house?

28:36.798 --> 28:40.886
Luke was our friend.
We went to ask if he killed him.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.639
Kind of risky,

28:43.639 --> 28:45.933
approaching someone
you believe to be a murderer.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.518
Did you honestly think
he'd confess?

28:48.518 --> 28:50.062
Isabella:
It was a long shot, but--

28:50.062 --> 28:51.271
We had nothing to lose.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.940
Sheriff:
That's what Isabella said.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.775
Almost word for word.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.318
You rehearsed well.

28:56.318 --> 28:57.736
Or, it's the truth.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.696
You've stated that
your friendship with Isabella

28:59.696 --> 29:00.948
ended last winter.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.366
You still stand by that?

29:02.366 --> 29:04.743
We are no longer friends,
that's right.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.704
And yet I found you together,
and you both maintained the lie

29:07.704 --> 29:10.999
about who was on the tape.
Why?

29:10.999 --> 29:14.086
Admitting it was Megan
after the fact
wouldn't have changed anything.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.589
Maybe. But if you thought it was
important enough for you two

29:17.589 --> 29:21.051
to keep it a secret
after all this time,
despite everything...

29:21.051 --> 29:23.595
it makes me wonder.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.431
Is it just a coincidence
that the only other person

29:26.431 --> 29:30.060
who knew about the lie is dead?

29:30.060 --> 29:31.728
Or did you just kill Luke

29:31.728 --> 29:34.314
because he was about
to reveal the truth?

29:34.314 --> 29:37.192
(intense music playing)

29:37.192 --> 29:39.778
(Megan gasps, sobs)

29:39.778 --> 29:43.615
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

29:43.615 --> 29:45.075
Oh, my God, Luke!

29:45.075 --> 29:47.869
This... this whole time,
you just...

29:47.869 --> 29:49.329
you just let me think that--

29:49.329 --> 29:51.456
You're worse than Brent.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.792
At least he doesn't pretend
to be a good guy.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.753
I made it so that
we could watch it, okay?

29:56.753 --> 29:58.755
Together. Look...

29:58.755 --> 30:00.048
No one else.

30:00.048 --> 30:02.509
I-I thought it would be fun.
Okay? Hot.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.678
I was gonna tell you.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.180
After the party.
But you were so upset.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.640
Did you play it at the party?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.934
No! No, I don't know who did.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.519
Please, Megan, please.

30:12.519 --> 30:13.854
I'm sorry,
you have to believe me,

30:13.854 --> 30:15.147
I'm sorry, okay?
I love you.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.314
-Just shut up.
-And I love you--

30:16.314 --> 30:17.232
Just shut up!

30:19.860 --> 30:22.237
Can we go? Can we just...
let's just leave him here.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.534
Luke: No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

30:27.534 --> 30:29.911
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

30:32.039 --> 30:33.373
She's lied to you too.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.334
What are you talking about?

30:36.334 --> 30:37.502
Isabella:
Luke...

30:38.795 --> 30:41.089
Luke...

30:41.089 --> 30:42.174
don't do this.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.510
Okay, um...

30:45.510 --> 30:47.512
Okay, Isabella and I...

30:49.264 --> 30:51.641
had sex. Once.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.685
Last summer.
Before you and I got together.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.323
Luke was always on board
with the lie.

31:06.323 --> 31:07.741
It had nothing to do with him.

31:07.741 --> 31:09.993
It was about me. For me.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.286
I don't follow.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.330
The tape was gonna ruin
my scholarship,

31:13.330 --> 31:14.748
destroy my future.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.875
Isabella took the blame
to protect me.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.835
Big lie to take on.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.170
It was.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.172
I don't know anyone else
in the world

31:22.172 --> 31:24.341
who would've done it.

31:24.341 --> 31:26.176
But I was desperate.

31:26.176 --> 31:28.470
So when she offered to say
that it was her on the tape,

31:28.470 --> 31:29.513
I let her.

31:29.513 --> 31:30.472
(door opens)

31:33.809 --> 31:35.143
(whispering indistinctly)

31:40.899 --> 31:42.859
(door closes)

31:42.859 --> 31:44.945
So, if you never cheated
with Luke,

31:44.945 --> 31:47.489
what was the real reason
your friendship with Megan
broke down?

31:47.489 --> 31:49.574
Gossip.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.326
Being called sluts.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.372
It wore us down.

31:55.372 --> 31:58.583
The noise got into our head.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.585
The lie became
this thing between us

32:00.585 --> 32:04.131
that we just... couldn't escape.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.967
I can see how
that would take a toll.

32:06.967 --> 32:09.594
And by the time
of New Year's Eve,
when Luke disappeared,

32:09.594 --> 32:11.847
how would you describe
your friendship with Megan?

32:11.847 --> 32:15.392
I've already told you,
it was over.

32:15.392 --> 32:17.435
We had our last fight
that night.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.271
After the party.

32:19.271 --> 32:22.232
You didn't make up after,
come to a truce?

32:23.775 --> 32:25.068
No.

32:26.862 --> 32:28.572
You sure about that?

32:31.658 --> 32:33.285
I'm positive.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.832
♪ All the signals you sent ♪

32:38.832 --> 32:42.711
♪ I can't comprehend
what's happening to me... ♪

32:42.711 --> 32:43.962
Hey, you.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.922
You know, it's kind of creepy

32:45.922 --> 32:47.799
how you only hang out
with high-school kids.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.969
-Hmm.
-What, you don't have any
friends your own age to harass?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.637
Nice sass.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.556
Yeah, but, uh...

32:54.556 --> 32:56.975
Now that you're done with Luke,
I was just thinking

32:56.975 --> 33:00.228
maybe you wanna upgrade,

33:00.228 --> 33:02.522
take a spin
on the OG Chambers bro?

33:02.522 --> 33:03.773
I'd rather eat glass.

33:06.568 --> 33:08.737
-(chuckles)
-You're a jerk!

33:08.737 --> 33:10.739
Oh, come on,
you know that you want it.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.741
Not in any universe.

33:12.741 --> 33:15.452
Okay, well, you're there
tossing it around,

33:15.452 --> 33:17.996
okay, you're asking for it.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.373
You're a tease.

33:20.373 --> 33:21.416
And you're a pathetic asshole.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.420
(car alarm chirps)

33:27.255 --> 33:29.132
Where's he going?

33:29.132 --> 33:31.134
You all right?

33:31.134 --> 33:32.969
He likes to push
the envelope, huh?

33:32.969 --> 33:34.971
He's totally harmless.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.514
Boys will be boys, right?

33:38.308 --> 33:39.476
You're okay.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.151
(R&B playing)

33:53.573 --> 33:56.201
-Hey.
-How's it going?

33:56.201 --> 33:59.204
My fingers are starting
to pucker. (giggles)

34:00.914 --> 34:03.041
-You okay?
-Yeah.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.544
You sure?

34:06.544 --> 34:08.546
You seem a little off.

34:08.546 --> 34:11.174
I'm just dehydrated.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.510
Okay. If you say so.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.637
You'd tell me if something
was wrong, right?

34:15.637 --> 34:17.347
Of course.

34:17.347 --> 34:18.515
No secrets.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.187
Well, I think Luke and I are
probably gonna bounce soon.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.231
So, I'll see you later?

34:26.231 --> 34:27.190
Okay.

34:33.488 --> 34:36.199
Can you run me through
what you did after the party
one more time?

34:36.199 --> 34:38.451
You have my client's
statement on this.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.411
Humor me.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.751
Luke and I went to the cabin.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.712
We hung out for a while

34:48.712 --> 34:51.381
and then I left him there,
went home.

34:51.381 --> 34:54.301
The next day when I went back
to take him to the train,
he was gone.

34:54.301 --> 34:58.430
I wasn't feeling well, so I left
the party early, went to bed.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.432
When did you last see Megan?

35:00.432 --> 35:02.309
I guess the next day.

35:02.309 --> 35:04.394
And when was the last time
you saw Isabella that night?

35:04.394 --> 35:05.312
At the party.

35:07.439 --> 35:10.734
This is Jeff Pope's footage
from the party.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.986
We went through it
when Luke went missing,

35:12.986 --> 35:15.989
searching for clues to
as why he might have run away.

35:15.989 --> 35:19.618
Based upon what we now know,
a second watch was...

35:19.618 --> 35:21.202
enlightening.

35:21.202 --> 35:25.999
(crowd clamoring)

35:25.999 --> 35:27.626
Rebecca:
What are we watching here?

35:27.626 --> 35:30.587
It's not so much what we see,
it's what we hear.

35:30.587 --> 35:34.633
It took some doing,
but our tech was able
to isolate your conversation.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.260
Megan: No, I'm not going
to let him get away with this.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.512
I'm not gonna
let him off that easy.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.765
What are you thinking?

35:41.765 --> 35:44.559
I think we should get
some serious revenge.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.478
I want to make Luke wish
that he'd never met us.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.648
Isabella:
What's your plan?

35:49.648 --> 35:52.233
-(video stops)
-Friends, co-conspirators.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.402
Call it what you like,
but you were clearly plotting

35:54.402 --> 35:56.655
against Luke on New Year's Eve.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.406
Together.

36:02.202 --> 36:03.953
You had sex with Luke?

36:07.123 --> 36:08.958
Megan, look...

36:08.958 --> 36:10.502
-I wanted to tell you.
-Luke: Megan...

36:10.502 --> 36:12.712
No, I wanted to tell you, okay?

36:12.712 --> 36:14.798
But he told me
not to say anything.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.716
He said that it would
hurt you too much.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.510
No, no, no, she said that you

36:18.510 --> 36:21.179
were too insecure to handle it.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.931
Isabella:
That's bullshit!

36:22.931 --> 36:26.643
No! No, you told me that
she wouldn't get over it!

36:26.643 --> 36:30.980
Megan, I didn't want to ruin
things with you, so I
went along with it, I swear.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.692
Because keeping a secret
with my boyfriend

36:33.692 --> 36:36.277
while I walk around clueless
wouldn't do any damage?

36:36.277 --> 36:38.113
-Megan!
-Don't. Don't.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.989
-Isabella.
-Megan, Megan, I'm sorry.

36:39.989 --> 36:42.117
Look at me, please.
I'm sorry, okay?

36:42.117 --> 36:44.452
Look, I thought
I was protecting you.

36:44.452 --> 36:48.415
I thought you were
my best friend, my sister.

36:48.415 --> 36:49.874
What a joke!

36:49.874 --> 36:51.584
-Megan, talk to me.
-No.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.253
No, we can talk this out,
okay, we can.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.672
Don't let her come
in between us.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.132
Screw you, Luke!

36:57.132 --> 36:59.592
No. Look...

36:59.592 --> 37:03.596
You always say how possessive
she is, right, how smothering?

37:05.849 --> 37:08.810
Look, she's gonna say anything
that she can right now.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.854
I mean, we...
we can talk this out, okay?

37:10.854 --> 37:13.481
We can, we can together, okay?
Okay?

37:13.481 --> 37:16.109
Look, I know I screwed up,
I know.

37:16.109 --> 37:19.612
I would not intentionally
hurt you, you know that.

37:19.612 --> 37:21.740
I wouldn't do it.
I love you.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.533
Shut up! (cocks gun)

37:30.165 --> 37:32.041
(relaxing music playing)

37:36.087 --> 37:38.840
Do they really think they're
being, like, stealth?

37:38.840 --> 37:41.301
(laughs) Maybe.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.011
I don't know,
but they suck at it.

37:43.011 --> 37:45.472
Debbie:
(laughing) Steve!

37:45.472 --> 37:47.849
Oh, my dad's kind of always
had a thing for your mom,

37:47.849 --> 37:50.477
so I'm not, like, shocked.

37:50.477 --> 37:52.979
Yeah, still, it's...

37:52.979 --> 37:57.066
He's her boss. It's...
It's a bad idea, in every way.

37:57.066 --> 38:00.403
Okay, go with me on this.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.573
If they're happy...

38:03.573 --> 38:05.158
(Debbie laughing)

38:05.158 --> 38:07.452
...and, I'm sorry, but those
are not unhappy noises--

38:07.452 --> 38:09.579
Eww! Gross.

38:09.579 --> 38:12.165
I'm just saying...

38:12.165 --> 38:13.708
then they'll get off our backs.

38:16.085 --> 38:19.631
And then "family time"
will mean that...

38:19.631 --> 38:21.925
we just get to be together.

38:21.925 --> 38:25.345
So, it's kind of a win-win.

38:25.345 --> 38:28.389
Okay. There is some logic there.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.433
It's creepy,
but it might be sound.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.060
See? I'm a genius.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.229
And what happens
if they break up, Einstein?

38:34.229 --> 38:35.563
What then?

38:35.563 --> 38:38.900
(clicks tongue)
Well, that would be ugly.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.531
When Megan saw this,
she admitted that

38:44.531 --> 38:47.075
you were with her and Luke
at the cabin after the party.

38:47.075 --> 38:49.410
That proves nothing.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.246
It's her word against
my client's.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.248
You may recall,
the toxicology indicated

38:53.248 --> 38:55.875
the presence of benzodiazepines
in Luke's system

38:55.875 --> 38:58.753
at the time of his death.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.922
She also accused you
of bringing pills to the cabin

39:00.922 --> 39:02.549
and drugging Luke.

39:02.549 --> 39:04.968
Tom:
You don't need to answer that.

39:04.968 --> 39:08.471
He's just fishing.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.015
I'd advise you
to tell me everything you can

39:11.015 --> 39:12.517
about what Isabella did

39:12.517 --> 39:16.271
and what Megan did that night
at the cabin.

39:16.271 --> 39:19.232
Unless you want to go down
for this...

39:19.232 --> 39:20.817
alone.

39:56.811 --> 39:59.439

-Oh.

39:59.439 --> 40:01.024

-What are you up for?

40:01.024 --> 40:02.150

40:19.292 --> 40:21.836
Yes, Isabella
was with me and Luke

40:21.836 --> 40:24.881
at the cabin on New Year's Eve.

40:24.881 --> 40:28.635
We wanted to confront Luke
for talking trash about us.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.637
But everything that happened
that night...

40:30.637 --> 40:31.930
...was her fault.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.389
Including Luke's death.

40:33.389 --> 40:36.059
Including
Luke's death.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.852
Megan: What are you doing?
Isabella, put it down!

40:37.852 --> 40:39.520
-Now!
-Are you insane?!

40:39.520 --> 40:40.772
Oh, my God!

40:40.772 --> 40:42.231
Take back what you said.

40:42.231 --> 40:44.275
-Megan--
-Take it back, Luke!

40:44.275 --> 40:46.110
She's literally crazy.

40:46.110 --> 40:50.657
No. No, tell Megan
that I'm a great friend!

40:50.657 --> 40:53.242
Tell her that you made me lie,
that I didn't want to do it!

40:53.242 --> 40:54.619
You made me, Luke. Tell her!

40:54.619 --> 40:56.120
Isabella, stop! Please.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.206
Then you see that she's crazy.
She's crazy.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.917
Megan, please.
Megan, don't listen to him!

41:00.917 --> 41:02.377
I know, it's okay.

41:02.377 --> 41:04.462
It's okay,
just put it down. Okay?

41:04.462 --> 41:06.881
Isabella, what do you want?
You want Megan all to yourself?

41:06.881 --> 41:08.967
-Is that what this is?
-Luke, shut up!

41:08.967 --> 41:11.052
Megan, you and I have known
each other our entire lives.

41:11.052 --> 41:14.013
We have. She's only been...

41:14.013 --> 41:17.141
You've only been here
for a minute, okay,
and you're gonna be gone soon.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.227
She's gonna forget you,
she's not gonna pick your side,

41:19.227 --> 41:21.521
so why don't you just...
just put the gun down?

41:25.692 --> 41:27.527
(Megan screams)

41:30.029 --> 41:31.698
(theme song playing)
