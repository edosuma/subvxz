18:37.950 --> 18:39.034
WHOA!

18:41.078 --> 18:42.579
THE MICROPHONE IS BROKEN!
THEY THINK WE'RE REAL ALIENS!

18:42.663 --> 18:44.832
- THAT'S CRAZY!

18:44.915 --> 18:47.125
HOW COULD THEY NOT EVEN
NOTICE WE'RE NOT THERE?

18:48.460 --> 18:49.837
- WHERE ARE LINK AND B.O.B.?

18:49.920 --> 18:50.587
- VISITING KIDS
WITH CLOWN ALLERGIES.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.506
- GOOD ON THEM.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.590
[shouts]

18:54.967 --> 18:57.427
- WE HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY
TO SHOW THEM IT'S US!

18:57.511 --> 18:58.846
B.O.B., MOVE TO THE PORTHOLE!

18:58.929 --> 19:01.139
I'M GONNA GIVE THEM A VISUAL!
- GOT IT!

19:01.223 --> 19:02.224
- IT'S THE WINDOW.
- GOT IT!

19:09.064 --> 19:11.233
[camera snaps]

19:11.316 --> 19:13.193
- THEY'RE MORE HIDEOUS
THAN I IMAGINED!

19:13.277 --> 19:15.028
- LOSE THE COSTUME!
- I'M WEARING A COSTUME?

19:15.112 --> 19:17.573
- FORGET IT!
WE HAVE TO ABANDON SHIP!

19:17.656 --> 19:20.659
[gear whirring]

19:20.742 --> 19:22.953
STUPID HATCH!
UNSTICK!

19:23.036 --> 19:24.204
- MAYBE WE SHOULD ASK
THE PILOT TO HELP.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.249
- THERE IS NO PILOT, B.O.B.
I'M FLYING THE--

19:27.332 --> 19:28.292
[engine whining]

19:28.375 --> 19:30.711
[both screaming]

19:30.794 --> 19:31.587
- MY TANKS!
[sniffling]

19:31.670 --> 19:34.506
I LOVE MY TANKS!

19:34.590 --> 19:35.757
- TAKE NO PRISONERS!

19:35.841 --> 19:38.844
SPARE NO WEAPONS!
SHOW NO MERCY!

19:40.971 --> 19:42.431
- GENERAL MONGER!

19:42.514 --> 19:44.516
IF WE ABDUCT HIM,
WE CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.726
- EVERYTHING?

19:45.809 --> 19:47.144
OKAY. BUT YOU COVER
WHERE BABIES COME FROM,

19:47.227 --> 19:50.606
BECAUSE I DO <i> NOT</i> GET
HOW THAT WORKS.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.821
- THE MENACE MUST BE BROUGHT
DOWN, NO MATTER WHAT!

19:57.905 --> 20:00.198
- GENERAL, LOOK OUT!

20:01.408 --> 20:02.326
- OH, DEAR.

20:02.409 --> 20:03.952
DISREGARD
ALL PREVIOUS STATEMENTS

20:04.036 --> 20:06.830
ON SHOWING NO MERC--
OOF!

20:06.914 --> 20:09.791
- AWW, COVERTON!
I WAS TRYING TO GET MONGER!

20:09.875 --> 20:12.169
- THEY'VE ABDUCTED COVERTON!
EVERYONE, HOLD YOUR FIRE!

20:12.252 --> 20:14.880
- NO!
COVERTON WAS RIGHT.

20:14.963 --> 20:18.508
WE MUST BRING THE ENEMY DOWN,
NO MATTER WHAT!

20:18.592 --> 20:20.385
IT IS WHAT
HE WOULD HAVE WANTED!

20:20.469 --> 20:24.431
[battle cry]

20:32.731 --> 20:36.652
- YOU HAVE LASERS.
USE THEM, FOR GLURM'S SAKE!

20:36.735 --> 20:37.319
- [gasps]
BROVERTON!

20:37.402 --> 20:38.737
THOSE ARE OUR FRIENDS!

20:38.820 --> 20:41.907
- NO, B.O.B, HE'S RIGHT.
THEY'VE LEFT US NO CHOICE.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.033
ARMING LASERS...

20:43.116 --> 20:44.284
[men yelling]

20:47.245 --> 20:49.665
- AAH!

20:49.748 --> 20:52.042
- YOU WANNA CHA-CHA,
LITTLE GREEN MEN?

20:52.125 --> 20:55.587
ALL UNITS, CONCENTRATE
SIMULTANEOUS FIRE ON THREE!

20:55.671 --> 20:56.338
ONE...
TWO...

20:56.421 --> 20:58.465
- NO, WAIT!
LOOK!

20:58.548 --> 21:00.592
- LINK AND B.O.B.?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.260
- "PLEASE STOP SHOOTING US."

21:02.344 --> 21:04.221
[sighs]
I GUESS.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.806
STAND DOWN, SOLDIERS!

21:05.889 --> 21:07.140
- AW...
- OH...

21:13.939 --> 21:15.273
- DON'T WORRY, EVERYBODY.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.150
THE KIDS ARE ALL SAFE
FROM CLOWN ALLERGIES.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.986
- BECAUSE WE TOTALLY
MADE THAT UP.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.863
- OH, BOY.
- LINK! B.O.B.!

21:21.947 --> 21:24.491
YOU TWO JOKERS ARE GONNA
BE SCRUBBING SO MANY LATRINES,

21:24.574 --> 21:28.120
YOU'LL THINK YOU GOT MARRIED
AND HAD TOILET BABIES!

21:30.205 --> 21:32.499
- THAT IS THE WEIRDEST
AND MOST TERRIFYING THREAT

21:32.582 --> 21:33.959
I'VE EVER HEARD.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.420
- AND LET THAT BE
A LESSON TO YOU:

21:36.503 --> 21:38.171
NEVER TRY TO PLAY ALIEN!

21:38.255 --> 21:40.799
LEAVE THAT TO ME,
THE ALIEN!

21:40.882 --> 21:42.759
-<i> ALIEN!</i>

21:42.843 --> 21:45.762
- WHAT THE--OW!
