WEBVTT

00:00.125 --> 00:03.208
I gotta get goin'

00:03.208 --> 00:06.708
a friend of mine

00:08.375 --> 00:11.333
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.000 --> 00:17.416
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.416 --> 00:20.875
I know he's out there

00:24.375 --> 00:27.708
we're so adventurous

00:27.708 --> 00:31.166
and again

00:31.166 --> 00:34.625
and there's nobody home

00:34.625 --> 00:38.083
to count on a friend

00:38.083 --> 00:41.583
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.625 --> 00:45.583
take me, please?

00:45.583 --> 00:49.000
I got to be there

00:50.958 --> 00:56.250
Winnie the Pooh

01:21.958 --> 01:26.250
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:26.250 --> 01:29.625
Help! Help!

01:29.625 --> 01:31.875
Tigger: Help!

01:31.875 --> 01:34.875
That's the most peculiar echo
I've ever heard.

01:34.875 --> 01:37.208
Help!

01:37.208 --> 01:40.083
Oh, d-d-dear.

01:40.083 --> 01:43.291
Hold on, Tigger!
I'll save you!

01:43.291 --> 01:46.250
As soon as someone saves me.

01:46.250 --> 01:47.250
Yipes!

01:51.291 --> 01:52.708
Yech!

01:52.708 --> 01:55.208
Piglet, you saved my life.

01:55.208 --> 01:58.875
- I did?
- Thanks, buddy boy.

01:58.875 --> 02:03.250
My goodness!
What was all that helping about?

02:03.250 --> 02:05.458
A near "drownding" was averted,

02:05.458 --> 02:08.458
thanks to some pretty
snappy thinking.

02:08.458 --> 02:10.625
Tigger!

02:10.625 --> 02:14.000
- You saved Piglet!
- I did?

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Oh, a noble deed, indeed!

02:17.000 --> 02:19.416
Congratulations, Tigger.

02:19.416 --> 02:23.125
No, you got it all
twisty-tailed around.

02:23.125 --> 02:26.583
- Piglet saved me.
-

02:26.583 --> 02:29.625
He's my knight
in shining armor.

02:29.625 --> 02:32.333
My hero sandwich.

02:35.458 --> 02:39.583
Ha! That's the way, sonny!

02:39.583 --> 02:43.458
I knew you had it in you
somewhere.

02:43.458 --> 02:46.708
You know, it used to be that
when the first party

02:46.708 --> 02:48.625
saved the life
of a second party,

02:48.625 --> 02:53.708
the second party then became
the first party's servant...

02:53.708 --> 02:55.500
out of gratitude.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.625
- Are we having a party?
- That's it, Piglet!

02:58.625 --> 03:00.833
I'll be your servant for life.

03:00.833 --> 03:04.000
It's the only way
I can ever repay you,

03:04.000 --> 03:05.750
oh, master of mine.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.208
Yipes!

03:07.208 --> 03:09.625
From now on,
you and me will be closer than

03:09.625 --> 03:11.333
teeth and gums.

03:11.333 --> 03:15.458
Well, uh, thank you, I think.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.833
Oh, d-d-dear.

03:37.833 --> 03:39.375
Good morning, Your Heroness.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.833
hey, buddy boy,
what are you doing?

03:41.833 --> 03:44.166
You're missing
the red carpet treatment.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.625
Did you like your breakfast
in bed? Did you?

03:46.625 --> 03:48.708
Hmm? Did you?

03:48.708 --> 03:51.583
Well, you really shouldn't
have gone to so much trouble.

03:51.583 --> 03:55.166
Trouble?
It's no trouble at all.

03:55.166 --> 03:58.375
You're getting this kind
of service every morning.

03:58.375 --> 04:01.625
Every morning?

04:01.625 --> 04:06.625
It's the least I can do
for my hero.

04:06.625 --> 04:09.458
That's very nice, but, uh,

04:09.458 --> 04:13.125
right now I have to clean
my house.

04:13.125 --> 04:17.375
Clean your house?

04:17.375 --> 04:21.208
That's servant work.
Step aside and let me at it.

04:24.708 --> 04:26.500
Oh, dear.

04:48.708 --> 04:51.500
Now, this Piglet shirt
went to market.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.958
Yeah! This Piglet shirt
stayed home.

04:54.958 --> 04:57.416
This Piglet shirt
ate roast beef.

04:57.416 --> 05:00.166
And this Piglet shirt
had none.

05:00.166 --> 05:03.750
And this Piglet shirt
went wee-wee-wee--

05:03.750 --> 05:06.083
What do you know?

05:06.083 --> 05:08.958
Fresh out of Piglet shirts.

05:12.625 --> 05:15.833
- Why, hello, Pig--
- Hide me!

05:15.833 --> 05:18.166
Tigger is too much servant

05:18.166 --> 05:20.458
for such a very small animal.

05:20.458 --> 05:21.583
- Yipes!

05:23.000 --> 05:24.416
Please don't tell
you know who

05:24.416 --> 05:26.458
that I'm hiding
you know where.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.958
I know what?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.166
hay buddy bear,
have you seen Piglet around?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.625
I can't find him!

05:35.625 --> 05:38.458
I can honestly say--

05:39.958 --> 05:42.375
...that I can't see Piglet--

05:43.833 --> 05:45.333
...at this particular moment.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.458
It ain't funny, Pooh.

05:47.458 --> 05:49.458
How can I be
his personal servant

05:49.458 --> 05:51.833
and do all sorts
of servanty things for him,

05:51.833 --> 05:54.583
- when he's not here?
-

05:54.583 --> 05:57.875
Fine! Ha! Laugh it up!

05:57.875 --> 06:01.375
I'm just gonna have
to look for my hero

06:01.375 --> 06:03.000
somewheres else.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.458
Oh, thank you, Pooh.
You saved my life.

06:06.458 --> 06:10.375
Does that mean Tigger's going
to be my servant now?

06:10.375 --> 06:12.333
Or are you?

06:12.333 --> 06:15.375
No, Pooh Bear,
that doesn't mean--

06:15.375 --> 06:17.875
Oh, dear!

06:17.875 --> 06:21.375
That's it!
What a wonderful idea!

06:21.375 --> 06:25.625
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome, Piglet.

06:25.625 --> 06:28.458
I wonder what wonderful idea
it was.

06:34.375 --> 06:36.000
There.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.500
Now all I have to do is wait
for Tigger to come along

06:38.500 --> 06:40.000
and save me.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.166
Then we'll be even.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.083
Tigger!

06:44.083 --> 06:46.875
Oh, Tigger!

06:46.875 --> 06:50.166
Oh, dear,
I better go look for him.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.000
My, either someone's very
long shoelace is untied,

07:01.875 --> 07:05.000
or Piglet's rope
has run away from home.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.708
I'd better return it.

07:15.750 --> 07:19.583
Why, Eyeore! You saved me!

07:19.583 --> 07:22.208
How can I ever repay you?

07:22.208 --> 07:25.291
You can start by calling me
a doctor.

07:28.583 --> 07:32.500
There! This is real danger.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.875
Help, Tigger! Oh, help!

07:35.875 --> 07:38.458
What's the problem,
hero of mine?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.458
Whoops!

07:48.708 --> 07:50.583
Move over, Gopher.

07:50.583 --> 07:52.958
Let me sit in the shade
for a while.

07:56.583 --> 08:00.458
Thanks, Rabbit,
you saved my life!

08:00.458 --> 08:04.958
Good. Then you can spend
the rest of it

08:04.958 --> 08:07.625
getting me out from under here.

08:07.625 --> 08:10.875
Help! Yoo-hoo! Help!

08:20.750 --> 08:23.416
Oh, dear, you're not Tigger.

08:23.416 --> 08:26.250
Sorry to disappoint you.

08:26.250 --> 08:30.291
Oh, well, I must find Tigger
so he can save me.

08:33.583 --> 08:36.958
Thanks for bothering
to save me, Owl.

08:36.958 --> 08:41.000
My pleasure, Eyeore.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Of course,
according to my calculations,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
you're much too heavy
for me to carry.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.708
Thought so.

08:56.458 --> 08:59.458
Pooh:
But if I saved you,

08:59.458 --> 09:01.708
Piglet:
You saved me.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.583
I saved you twice!

09:04.583 --> 09:06.833
Don't you have to call
for help first?

09:06.833 --> 09:08.291
I have it!

09:08.291 --> 09:10.458
It's a simple matter
of arithmetic!

09:10.458 --> 09:14.166
All we do I'd invert
the height of the sun
in the sky

09:14.166 --> 09:18.166
and multiply by the square root
of the hypotenuse.

09:18.166 --> 09:21.000
Hey! Who are you calling
a hippopotamus?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.375
So who is whose servant?

09:23.375 --> 09:28.375
As of now, no one is,
except for Tigger,

09:28.375 --> 09:30.333
who is still Piglet's--

09:31.250 --> 09:33.416
Hear that?

09:33.416 --> 09:35.458
It's you and me for life!

09:35.458 --> 09:39.000
Oh... wonderful.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.708
It seems to me that
all this heroism calls
for a celebration.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.583
What a delicious idea.

09:51.625 --> 09:55.750
Oh, so where is Piglet
exactly?

09:55.750 --> 09:57.416
He told me to wait
for him here

09:57.416 --> 09:59.458
'cause he's got
a big surprise.

09:59.458 --> 10:03.875
Maybe the surprise is
he's not coming.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.583
Not coming?

10:05.583 --> 10:09.708
My hero of heroes
miss his own party?

10:11.125 --> 10:12.291
Never!

10:13.875 --> 10:15.750
If Tigger were here to help me,

10:15.750 --> 10:18.583
I'd never had finished
this honey cake in time.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.708
If ever.

10:22.333 --> 10:23.875
Oh, boy!

10:28.375 --> 10:29.708
Oh, sorry, Mr. Bee,

10:29.708 --> 10:31.708
but this cake is for
our hero party.

10:40.083 --> 10:42.083
Help!

10:42.083 --> 10:43.416
Come on, Your Heroship!

10:43.416 --> 10:44.750
No time for dessert.

10:46.291 --> 10:47.750
Where are we going?

10:47.750 --> 10:49.291
I don't know.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.750
But we'll take the shortcut.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.875
This is a shorter cut
than I thought.

11:00.375 --> 11:04.333
Tigger, why,
you saved my life.

11:04.333 --> 11:07.250
What do you know, kid?

11:07.250 --> 11:08.958
I did, didn't I?

11:08.958 --> 11:11.583
You're a hero, Tigger!

11:11.583 --> 11:15.166
And heroes don't have
to be servants anymore.

11:15.166 --> 11:18.000
Thank goodness.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.958
Oh, the poor little guy's
so upset.

11:20.958 --> 11:22.708
He's practically in tears.

11:22.708 --> 11:24.458
Don't worry, Piglet.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.000
I can still be your servant
if you want.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.208
Someone save me!

11:28.208 --> 11:30.208
Say, what's the matter
with him?

11:30.208 --> 11:33.458
Doesn't he know good help's
hard to find?

11:45.708 --> 11:50.875
143, 144, 145,

11:50.875 --> 11:53.958
146, 147--

11:53.958 --> 11:56.125
Oh, look, here's one.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.166
Two, three, four--

12:00.375 --> 12:03.208
I wonder where
all these feathers came from.

12:03.208 --> 12:05.500
From the clouds, do you think?

12:05.500 --> 12:10.458
Nah! My guess is that
they're horse feathers.

12:10.458 --> 12:13.458
Tigger!
Horses don't have feathers!

12:13.458 --> 12:15.833
Yeah, that's because
they all fell off.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.625
Piglet: Excuse me.

12:18.625 --> 12:21.250
Would anyone like to see
a magic trick?

12:21.250 --> 12:23.875
No offense, Piglet,

12:23.875 --> 12:26.750
but none of your trickeroos
ever work.

12:26.750 --> 12:29.333
That's why I've been
studying this magic--

12:29.333 --> 12:32.083
16, 17, 18...

12:32.083 --> 12:34.875
There's a wonderful trick
on page 57.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.583
58, 59--

12:37.583 --> 12:42.000
Can you really do magic,
Piglet?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.500
Well, um, I--

12:43.500 --> 12:45.583
Just do the trick!

12:45.583 --> 12:48.708
- Let's get this over with!
- Oh, thank you, Rabbit.

12:48.708 --> 12:50.208
You'll like this one.

12:50.208 --> 12:53.416
Abracadabra.
All right.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.500
For my first trick,

13:01.500 --> 13:03.458
I will pull a rabbit
out of my hat.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.875
Abracadabra.

13:06.875 --> 13:08.625
Abra-kaboom.

13:08.625 --> 13:10.500
Appear little rabbit.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.708
Money kazoom!

13:13.000 --> 13:14.458
Hmm.

13:14.458 --> 13:17.583
Aren't rabbits supposed
to have longer ears?

13:17.583 --> 13:19.958
Oh, dear,
you're not a rabbit.

13:19.958 --> 13:22.750
Huh! You're darn tootin'!

13:30.750 --> 13:34.333
I think you need a little
more hocus in your pocus,
buddy boy.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.875
Excuse me, my friend,

13:40.875 --> 13:44.250
but I believe I have
the right of way,

13:44.250 --> 13:45.625
and I quote,

13:45.625 --> 13:49.250
"Owls always have
the right of way

13:49.250 --> 13:54.333
over the common,
ordinary water fowl."

13:58.750 --> 14:00.875
Good day, everyone.

14:00.875 --> 14:04.375
I hop you don't mind my dropping
in on you unannounced.

14:04.375 --> 14:08.583
I knew it!
Owl, they're your feathers!

14:08.583 --> 14:10.458
I beg your pardon.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.333
Maybe we can put them back
where they belong.

14:13.333 --> 14:14.458
You're right.

14:16.375 --> 14:18.625
What is this?

14:18.625 --> 14:21.125
It doesn't look
quite right to me.

14:21.125 --> 14:24.875
So many feathers falling out
can only mean one thing.

14:24.875 --> 14:25.875
Owl's going bald.

14:27.583 --> 14:30.458
Me? Going bald?

14:30.458 --> 14:32.000
Horse feathers!

14:32.000 --> 14:35.083
See? I told you.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.458
This is serious.

14:37.458 --> 14:40.833
Before long, you won't have
any feathers at all.

14:40.833 --> 14:45.250
And without feathers,
you won't be able to fly.

14:46.625 --> 14:49.333
Not fly? Nonsense!

14:49.333 --> 14:51.166
I can fly perfectly.

14:51.166 --> 14:54.083
You crashed perfectly.
Remember?

14:54.083 --> 14:57.000
Well, yes.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.416
Oh, my, you're right.

14:59.416 --> 15:03.708
Excuse me, but isn't it
maybe just possible that

15:03.708 --> 15:07.708
running into the ducks
had something to do
with Owl falling from the sky?

15:07.708 --> 15:12.125
Don't be ridiculous.
We're talking feathers,
not ducks.

15:12.125 --> 15:14.833
We're very sorry, owl.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.708
Why is it always the good ones
who lose their feather so young?

15:21.708 --> 15:24.625
Oh...

15:24.625 --> 15:28.000
Perhaps you should go home
and get some rest.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.250
Oh, my. Yes.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.750
Perhaps I should.

15:40.708 --> 15:44.125
Oh, no, Rabbit was right!

15:44.125 --> 15:46.750
I am losing my feathers!

15:46.750 --> 15:49.875
Oh, woe is me.

15:49.875 --> 15:52.250
A once, young, vibrant owl

15:52.250 --> 15:54.375
with the world at his wingtips

15:54.375 --> 15:59.416
reduced to the featherless
shadow of his former self.

15:59.416 --> 16:02.500
Good afternoon, Owl.
We've come to cheer you up.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.958
Thank you, Pooh Bear,

16:04.958 --> 16:09.583
but I'm afraid
I'm too miserable
to be cheered up.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.875
Know how you feel.

16:11.875 --> 16:15.291
Maybe a little magic trick
will make him feel better?

16:15.291 --> 16:17.125
I doubt it.

16:17.125 --> 16:20.458
Probably make him feel worse.

16:20.458 --> 16:22.291
Excuse me, Owl.

16:22.291 --> 16:25.000
Would you mind if I made
some flowers appear?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.333
Wonderful!

16:27.333 --> 16:29.125
Nothing up my sleeves!

16:29.125 --> 16:32.000
Abracadabra!

16:32.000 --> 16:33.625
Alla-kazoom!

16:33.625 --> 16:36.708
Bouquet of flowers
appear in this room!

16:36.708 --> 16:38.958
They must be around here
somewhere.

16:43.875 --> 16:46.083
Oh, dear.
How did that get in there?

16:46.083 --> 16:48.416
- Yipe!

16:50.750 --> 16:54.500
This is getting better
all the time.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.000
Oh, d-dear.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
I guess I haven't gotten
all the bugs out of
my magic yet.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.208
It's all right.

17:08.208 --> 17:12.708
This is the best thing
that's happened to me all day.

17:12.708 --> 17:14.708
I know what you mean.

17:14.708 --> 17:19.000
We've got to think
of some way to help owl.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.333
Rabbit, you're right.

17:23.333 --> 17:28.500
Unfortunately, thinking isn't
one of the things I do best.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.708
There, that should do it, Owl.

17:32.708 --> 17:36.625
You'll be flying in no time.

17:36.625 --> 17:39.833
Are you quite certain
that badminton racquets

17:39.833 --> 17:42.875
are a suitable substitute
for wings?

17:42.875 --> 17:45.500
Oh, they've never
failed me before.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.375
But then,
I've never tried them before.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.083
Now you're getting
the hang of it, buddy bird!

17:57.083 --> 18:00.458
It's just like flying,
only using your legs.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.875
I say, what a wonderful feeling

18:02.875 --> 18:06.708
to be elevated back
to my natural habitat.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.833
Oh, to breathe the clean,
fresh air.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.208
To gaze across the--

18:18.708 --> 18:22.000
I will now make Tigger
vanish into thin air.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.708
Uh, will everyone
please cover their eyes?

18:25.750 --> 18:27.875
Abracadabra!

18:27.875 --> 18:29.250
Abra-kazang!

18:29.250 --> 18:30.583
Tigger vanish!

18:30.583 --> 18:32.708
Go where?

18:32.708 --> 18:37.000
What a wonderful trick, Piglet.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.083
Not only did you make
Tigger disappear,

18:40.083 --> 18:43.208
you made everyone else
disappear, too.

18:43.208 --> 18:46.291
Now they're back!

18:46.291 --> 18:48.708
- Amazing!
- Eyeore: Hello.

18:48.708 --> 18:51.458
Eyeore!
What are you doing here?

18:51.458 --> 18:54.583
You're supposed
to be cheering up Owl.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.583
Tried to,

18:56.583 --> 18:58.458
but he's too depressed.

18:58.458 --> 19:02.625
I hate being around
those gloomy types.

19:02.625 --> 19:06.291
I still don't understand
why he can't fly.

19:06.291 --> 19:09.083
Perhaps it's only in his head.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.583
Owls don't have feathers
in their head.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.833
Do they?

19:13.833 --> 19:17.166
Well, not that I know of.

19:17.166 --> 19:20.000
I think Owl needs me.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.583
Maybe there's something
I can do.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.458
I wish I knew what it was.

19:28.833 --> 19:32.416
Owl, would you like to see
one of my magic tricks?

19:32.416 --> 19:35.000
No, thank you, Piglet.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.458
I'd rather sit,
staring at nothing...

19:38.458 --> 19:40.458
nothing at all.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.708
But this trick never fails.

19:42.708 --> 19:45.625
Abracadabra, abra-cabai!

19:45.625 --> 19:49.708
Make me go up very, very high.

19:49.708 --> 19:52.375
But not too high.

19:52.375 --> 19:56.708
- Yipe!
- Piglet, you're flying!

19:56.708 --> 20:01.000
I say, do you think
your magic might work on me?

20:01.000 --> 20:04.875
I don't see why not.
If it can make a Piglet fly,

20:04.875 --> 20:06.958
it should work wonders
on an owl.

20:06.958 --> 20:10.625
Well, then by all means,
please try it on me.

20:10.625 --> 20:15.166
All right,
but you must repeat after me.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.291
Hocus pocus, ollie-ocus.

20:17.291 --> 20:20.625
Hocus pocus, ollie-ocus.

20:20.625 --> 20:22.625
Fly hither, fly wither!

20:22.625 --> 20:24.333
Fly every ither.

20:24.333 --> 20:29.000
Owl go up there somewhere.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.250
I don't believe I'm flying.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.708
I think you have
to flap your wings.

20:34.708 --> 20:37.458
Of course.

20:37.458 --> 20:39.708
It's been so long,
I forgot.

20:43.708 --> 20:45.958
Piglet, it worked!

20:45.958 --> 20:47.583
I'm airborne!

20:50.833 --> 20:52.583
You did it, Piglet.

20:52.583 --> 20:56.958
But why didn't you mention
that magic spell before?

20:56.958 --> 21:01.583
I guess I just made it up.

21:03.208 --> 21:04.291
Well, that's a lucky thing

21:04.291 --> 21:06.375
that you made up
the right spell.

21:07.958 --> 21:10.416
And thanks to Piglet's magic,

21:10.416 --> 21:13.208
Owl got his feathers
and can fly again.

21:13.208 --> 21:16.875
Pooh! These aren't Owl's
feathers, they're mine!

21:16.875 --> 21:20.875
You mean, now you
won't be able to fly?

21:20.875 --> 21:22.458
Oh, bother.

21:22.458 --> 21:25.458
Maybe Piglet's spell
will work on you, too.

21:25.458 --> 21:29.208
No, Pooh!
The feathers are for my pillow!

21:29.208 --> 21:33.250
Don't you remember the pillow
fight we had the other night?

21:33.250 --> 21:37.708
Oh, yes. Now that you
mention it, I do remember.

21:39.166 --> 21:42.083
I guess it must have slipped
my mind.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.708
Silly old bear.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Excuse me, but I can finally
pull a rabbit out of a hat,

21:49.000 --> 21:50.750
I think.

21:50.750 --> 21:55.000
- Do you wanna see it?
- Sure, Piglet. We'd love to.

21:56.333 --> 21:58.958
Abracadabra, abra-kazaam.

21:58.958 --> 22:01.958
Appear, rabbit.
I command...

22:01.958 --> 22:03.458
if it's not too much trouble.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.500
Oh, dear.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.458
Maybe I should give up magic

22:10.458 --> 22:13.208
and try something
a little less confusing?

22:54.208 --> 22:57.375
Winnie the Pooh Bear

22:59.458 --> 23:01.250
take me, please?

23:01.250 --> 23:04.416
I got to be there

23:06.250 --> 23:11.000
Winnie the Pooh
