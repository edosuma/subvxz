00:00.840 --> 00:03.960
My father has commanded me
to return to Sept-Tours.

00:04.120 --> 00:06.280
Matthew will need you.
You must be his anchor.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.800
Otherwise he may lose himself.

00:07.960 --> 00:10.560
I wish I could prepare you
for whatever is about to happen.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.200
It's you I'm worried about.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.760
When we lose someone we love,
we'd give anything to have them back.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.640
I'm looking forward to seeing
Ysabeau in these times.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.960
She won't be there. She spent
most of this year in Trier.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.440
At the witch trials?

00:21.600 --> 00:23.040
Yet this is the woman
that will accept me

00:23.200 --> 00:24.520
into her family and give me
her cherished ring.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.800
You should have
told me about your witch.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.520
I love Matthew.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.120
If this relationship truly
meant something to you,

00:31.280 --> 00:33.680
you would have consummated it.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.880
I'm tolerating them under my roof
and affording them my protection.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.520
We don't need
to play happy families.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.360
There is a schism between us.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.520
-In your time.
-Don't.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.880
Allow me to introduce
<i>Monsieur </i>Andre Champier...

00:45.040 --> 00:48.280
-Your memories, give them to me.
-They're mine!

00:52.880 --> 00:56.000
<i>I said no!</i>

01:18.640 --> 01:20.480
Diana?

01:20.640 --> 01:23.400
-Diana?
-I'm okay.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.480
-Yet you say nothing?
-I did not summon the witch.

01:35.640 --> 01:39.160
You allowed him into Sept-Tours.
You risked Diana's life. Why?

01:39.320 --> 01:44.320
I needed to be sure of her.
She knows too many of our secrets.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.240
And I do not take risks
with my family.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.400
And would you have stopped him
from ripping out her memories?

01:50.560 --> 01:52.160
Diana saved herself.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.720
And now she'll have to live with
the consequences. Won't she?

01:55.880 --> 02:00.640
Lives will be lost
because of your union.

02:02.360 --> 02:05.800
And I don't expect him
to be the last.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.920
Dispose of it.

02:08.080 --> 02:12.240
I don't care who you are.
I will not be tested like that.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.400
Where did you get this ring?

02:17.640 --> 02:19.080
It was a gift from Ysabeau.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.600
She would never
bequeath that to anyone.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.640
Let alone a witch.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.440
Not...

02:31.840 --> 02:35.240
Not as long as I lived.

02:38.280 --> 02:41.000
No one is truly immortal, Father.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.400
Not even you.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.840
Diana!

03:08.680 --> 03:10.840
You can't keep
shutting me out.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.640
I needed time to think.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.000
If I didn't stop him,

03:33.160 --> 03:35.880
he would have ripped out
every last memory I have.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.560
Without my memories,
who would I be?

03:40.080 --> 03:42.440
The thing is,

03:42.600 --> 03:44.520
I wanted to kill him.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.400
What am I becoming?

04:53.680 --> 04:56.480
<i>My dearest Ysabeau...</i>

05:26.920 --> 05:29.880
There's something wrong
with the witches.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.720
This room is off-limits.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.440
I know. I'm sorry.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.040
But something
strange is happening.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.800
-Strange how?
-It's a faint vibration.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.320
I've never felt
anything like it.

05:44.480 --> 05:49.760
Whatever it is,
it's focused here, in this room.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.200
These books

05:53.360 --> 05:56.760
were one of Philippe's
favorite hiding places.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.320
For what?

05:59.440 --> 06:01.440
Messages.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.600
Check every inch
of these horses and their tack.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.280
-Going somewhere?
-Yes. I have an errand to run

06:48.440 --> 06:50.440
for Her Majesty in Bohemia.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.000
Father, don't.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.720
In coming to this time,

07:02.880 --> 07:06.760
you have left Ysabeau alone
to face your enemies.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.760
Baldwin will ensure her safety.

07:09.920 --> 07:16.200
To think that at this very moment
she is hunting witches in Trier,

07:16.360 --> 07:19.440
and yet in the future
she has bequeathed her ring

07:19.600 --> 07:21.000
to one of their own kind.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.320
Perhaps she has evolved.
Like me.

07:24.480 --> 07:28.000
How long has
she been without me?

07:28.160 --> 07:29.680
I will not answer that.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.160
How long have I been
dead in your time?

07:38.320 --> 07:41.000
I cannot answer that.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.200
How long...

07:49.480 --> 07:51.400
The slightest knowledge
of what's to come could be dangerous.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.560
It could affect future events.
Future lives.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.480
This newfound caution of yours

07:55.640 --> 07:58.360
has blunted your technique.
Where is your might?

07:58.520 --> 08:00.480
Where is your thirst for blood?

08:00.640 --> 08:02.880
Where is my Matthaios?

08:04.080 --> 08:07.320
Good. He's still
in there, then.

08:07.480 --> 08:11.880
And yet it is shrouded
in guilt and fear.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.680
Come on. Come on.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.560
Release him.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.400
I stepped out of his
shadow a long time ago.

08:20.560 --> 08:24.080
And I will not be
your pawn anymore.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.880
Then prove it.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.240
You should not be in here.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.120
Philippe told me I was
welcome to read his books.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.640
This map, do you know what it is?

09:21.800 --> 09:25.920
It is plotting the location
of covens across Burgundy.

09:29.120 --> 09:32.760
Madam De Clermont relies on these
to guide her witch hunts.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.760
-Is that where she is now?
-No, <i>madame.</i>

09:37.920 --> 09:42.200
This is the next witch hunt.
These are her plans.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.360
Please.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.680
Matthaios!

10:51.240 --> 10:52.960
Matthaios!

11:11.360 --> 11:13.760
Stop.
We are not finished yet.

11:19.320 --> 11:23.000
-What is going on?
-There's a fight outside.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.600
What is it?

11:31.040 --> 11:34.960
Your conscience is a handicap.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.480
A weakness that has
dulled your instincts.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.720
Now, tell me!

11:40.880 --> 11:42.800
Matthew!

11:44.680 --> 11:49.120
-What have you done to him?
-This is what we call a blood rage.

11:50.240 --> 11:55.000
It is an affliction.
A sickness of the vampire blood.

11:55.160 --> 11:58.120
He does not belong to himself
when the rage is upon him.

11:58.280 --> 12:02.320
Oh... He is pure predator.

12:07.480 --> 12:11.560
-Tell me how I died.
-I cannot tell you.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.000
I cannot.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.280
I cannot tell you.

12:27.320 --> 12:31.000
Then your conscience
has the better of me.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.640
I haven't lost control
like that in a very...

13:26.120 --> 13:27.840
Very long time.

13:35.680 --> 13:41.360
I trained myself
to hold the blood rage back.

13:43.640 --> 13:46.400
Then I used your letters
to try to understand it,

13:46.560 --> 13:48.360
to try to...

13:49.440 --> 13:51.080
Find a cure.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.600
Darling...

13:55.640 --> 13:58.360
It's Ysabeau
who carries the honors.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.560
Luckily, she's spared
of its effects.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.680
Louisa and I are not so fortunate.

14:09.680 --> 14:13.640
This is why we can
never be truly mated.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.120
Do you really think

14:29.280 --> 14:33.360
that I would ever walk away
from you, my love?

14:37.360 --> 14:39.720
After all we've been through?

14:44.320 --> 14:46.720
This was but just a glimpse.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.520
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.160
I'm a killer, Diana.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.760
I have killed thousands.
I was Philippe's weapon.

15:02.960 --> 15:06.960
He used me
to eradicate the disease.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.880
He made you his assassin.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.760
You provoked and
humiliated your own son.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.560
You exploited his pain.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.760
And for what?
To drive me away?

15:25.960 --> 15:29.400
You needed to see
the wolf behind the man.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.080
If you are to have
a future together,

15:32.240 --> 15:36.280
you must accept
every facet of him.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.960
And Matthew must be freed
of the guilt that he carries.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.640
You did this for us?

15:44.800 --> 15:47.080
Your union is forbidden

15:47.240 --> 15:50.480
in your time, too,
or you would not be here.

15:50.640 --> 15:55.280
The two of you will face
forces of great malevolence.

15:55.440 --> 15:59.280
You must be united, your faith
in each other unwavering.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.520
-It already is.
-No.

16:01.680 --> 16:06.880
Faith is worthless if left untested.
And Matthew...

16:07.040 --> 16:11.080
Matthew has less faith
than anyone I have ever known.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.400
He had faith in you, Philippe.

16:14.960 --> 16:19.280
All his life he has tried to prove
himself to you.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.120
And you used it against him.

16:22.280 --> 16:26.920
Your legacy is one
of pain and recrimination.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.760
Who are you

16:30.840 --> 16:35.760
to lecture me on my legacy? Hmm?

16:35.920 --> 16:38.840
I am worthy of your son.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.240
There is

16:55.240 --> 16:57.440
an ancient prophecy.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.600
It tells of a witch

17:04.560 --> 17:10.080
who would change
the destiny of all creatures.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.560
Well, some believe

17:12.720 --> 17:17.840
that this fearsome witch
will alter

17:18.000 --> 17:23.920
our understanding
of life itself.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.880
"The old world will die

17:32.200 --> 17:36.960
"and a new will be born."

17:37.120 --> 17:39.280
What do you believe?

17:46.760 --> 17:49.240
I believe you

17:51.040 --> 17:54.520
are power indeed.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.160
Yes, I am.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.880
But I love your son.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.040
And that should be enough.

18:21.800 --> 18:25.720
I will not ask
of my future again.

18:26.560 --> 18:31.840
Your blood rage
is close to the surface.

18:32.840 --> 18:35.640
If the Congregation challenged
your right to be with Diana

18:35.800 --> 18:38.720
and you responded with violence,

18:38.880 --> 18:40.720
you will lose her.

18:44.600 --> 18:49.040
There must be no question
that Diana is a De Clermont.

18:51.640 --> 18:56.560
Our family is made
through blood.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.240
With this mark

19:00.840 --> 19:03.160
you are dead,

19:03.320 --> 19:07.680
a shade among the living
without clan or kin.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.800
And with this mark,

19:13.400 --> 19:15.840
you are reborn,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.160
and forever a member
of our family.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.040
Are you okay?

20:06.320 --> 20:09.320
The way Philippe's
life ended,

20:10.400 --> 20:13.800
I've spent 70 years trying
to block out his final days.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.240
Well, maybe if you
share the burden,

20:16.400 --> 20:18.480
the memories
will lose their power.

20:19.480 --> 20:23.240
And you can leave them here
in the past.

20:32.080 --> 20:35.120
Philippe was taken
during the Second World War

20:35.280 --> 20:38.760
trying to free Allied spies.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.360
And he was held
in the Nazi death camps.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.760
They had never
captured a vampire before

20:45.920 --> 20:48.240
and he fascinated them.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.960
They used witches

20:57.880 --> 21:00.080
to extract his memories.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.600
They tortured him to see how much pain
he could endure before he died.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.880
Hour upon hour

21:21.320 --> 21:23.440
of unspeakable acts.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.880
Every day,

21:29.080 --> 21:30.720
for three months.

21:34.600 --> 21:38.200
With Baldwin's help,
I rescued him.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.960
But his mind was broken.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.720
He begged Ysabeau to kill him...

21:52.520 --> 21:54.560
to end his suffering.

21:56.520 --> 21:59.280
But I couldn't let
her live with that.

22:05.280 --> 22:10.120
So...
So I did it.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.920
I did it.

22:15.720 --> 22:21.280
I saw all of his
fractured memories,

22:24.800 --> 22:27.280
all the torture and the pain.

22:30.400 --> 22:35.440
Most creatures's memories
unfurl like ribbons,

22:35.600 --> 22:38.680
but his were
like shards of glass.

22:45.400 --> 22:49.680
He was broken.
He was frightened.

22:51.240 --> 22:54.120
But his heart remained fierce.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.720
And in his final moments,

23:02.280 --> 23:05.120
all he thought of was Ysabeau.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.440
And now...

23:12.640 --> 23:14.520
And now she...

23:16.800 --> 23:22.520
She can't look at me
without remembering that day.

23:24.720 --> 23:28.080
Now I have to face you, too.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.800
You didn't kill Philippe.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.680
You released him.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.520
Ysabeau,
there's nothing here.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.080
It has been hours
and we need to get our rest.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.920
The feeling you
had this morning,

24:18.080 --> 24:19.440
that vibration.
Is it still here?

24:19.600 --> 24:21.520
Sorry, it's faded.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.000
I'm sure
there's a message here.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.480
I know there is.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.680
Sleep if you must.
I'll keep looking.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.680
I can continue on my own.

24:30.840 --> 24:34.280
Sarah, Come on.
Come on, doll.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.440
Good night, Ysabeau.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.040
Come on, baby.

24:48.440 --> 24:52.040
It's very late.
I thought you might like this.

24:54.280 --> 24:59.160
The prospect of one last
message from Philippe is...

25:00.160 --> 25:02.720
It's almost too much to bear.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.440
I'll help you look.

25:22.840 --> 25:28.040
<i>Tell me of Ysabeau.</i>
<i>How does she fare?</i>

25:28.200 --> 25:30.080
Matthew would know
better than I.

25:30.240 --> 25:34.680
No. Matthew would tell me only
what he thought I wanted to hear.

25:34.840 --> 25:39.600
Whereas I suspect from you
I would get only the truth.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.960
She's well.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.720
But lonely.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.640
I know she misses you
a great deal.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.880
And there we have it.
The truth.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.960
Thank you.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.520
What is this place?

26:00.680 --> 26:03.720
It's dedicated
to your namesake,

26:03.880 --> 26:05.440
the goddess Diana.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.840
When I was a boy,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.840
brides would come
to temples like this

26:12.000 --> 26:14.840
to ask the goddess
for her protection.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.560
In two days time,
you will be married...

26:23.400 --> 26:28.120
...in a manner
that honors our ancestors.

26:30.560 --> 26:33.880
A lock of your hair,
a symbol of your maidenhood.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.360
Yes.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.840
Money, a symbol of your worth.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.400
Artemis<i> Agrotera,</i>

26:53.200 --> 26:55.640
renowned huntress,

26:56.520 --> 27:00.840
I beseech you to hold this child,
Diana, in your hand.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.920
Artemis<i> Lycaea,</i>

27:04.080 --> 27:10.720
lady of the wolves,
protect her in every way.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.920
Artemis<i> Phosphorus,</i>

27:14.080 --> 27:16.080
show her the light
of your wisdom

27:16.240 --> 27:19.200
when she is in darkness.

27:19.360 --> 27:22.240
And Artemis<i> Upis,</i>

27:22.400 --> 27:25.600
watch over your namesake

27:25.760 --> 27:28.520
during her journey

27:28.680 --> 27:33.920
in this Earth.

27:34.080 --> 27:37.040
Yes. Now.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.720
Artemis has accepted
your gifts.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.520
You can go.

28:49.920 --> 28:52.520
We have a wedding
to prepare for.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.600
So I guess
we're getting married.

28:59.760 --> 29:02.480
We don't have
to do what he says.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.800
What if I wanted to?

29:04.960 --> 29:07.880
You'd really marry me
after everything you've learned?

29:08.040 --> 29:11.200
If you ask nicely.

29:11.360 --> 29:15.760
Diana Bishop, my love,
will you marry me?

29:15.920 --> 29:18.320
Of course I will.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.960
I have something for you.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.520
I found it

29:50.680 --> 29:53.880
on a battlefield
during the vampire wars.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.880
Oh, it's a flash of blue.

29:58.040 --> 30:02.280
It caught my eye.
It lay in a shaft of sunlight.

30:02.440 --> 30:05.320
As I bent down to retrieve it,

30:05.480 --> 30:08.520
this volume of arrows
carved the air

30:08.680 --> 30:12.440
just inches above my head.

30:12.600 --> 30:16.400
This fibula may well have
saved my life.

30:17.320 --> 30:20.000
And now I bequeath
its good fortune...

30:22.400 --> 30:24.680
...to you.

30:24.840 --> 30:29.080
I'd like you to wear it
in the ceremony.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.800
Thank you, Father.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.080
Welcome.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.840
My darling,
you are so beautiful.

31:48.600 --> 31:52.680
I, Matthew, give my body
to you, Diana,

31:52.840 --> 31:55.200
in faithful matrimony...

31:55.360 --> 31:57.680
And I receive it.

32:02.280 --> 32:06.520
I, Diana, give my body
to you, Matthew.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.560
And I receive it.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.560
<i>Merci.</i>

32:46.040 --> 32:47.680
<i>Merci.</i>

33:00.560 --> 33:04.400
I believe the first dance
belongs to me.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.280
My daughter.

33:16.880 --> 33:19.760
How will you keep us a secret
when Ysabeau returns?

33:19.920 --> 33:21.640
Instructions have been
issued now.

33:21.800 --> 33:26.800
If anyone talks, they will
find their tongues confiscated.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.920
She cannot and will not
learn of this.

33:29.080 --> 33:32.360
But I do wish
Ysabeau could be here

33:32.520 --> 33:35.080
to see Matthew's happiness.

33:35.240 --> 33:38.160
One day, I'll tell her everything.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.040
Ysabeau would scarce
to believe it.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.000
Married with
Philippe's blessing.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.320
And his insistence.

33:58.760 --> 34:02.600
Don't tell him, but you're
a much better dancer.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.400
Don't rush.

35:38.920 --> 35:42.720
-Did that belong to Lucas?
-Yes.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.840
I carved it for him.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.720
I never could
get the tail right.

35:49.800 --> 35:53.240
I bet you were
an amazing father.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.680
Lucas gave me purpose

35:55.840 --> 35:59.320
and he ignited the love
I'd have never known.

35:59.480 --> 36:03.480
Hmm. I've seen
a glimpse of that with Jack.

36:03.640 --> 36:04.960
Mmm.

36:08.680 --> 36:11.680
I'm sorry we won't have
children of our own.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.240
Shh.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.680
I'd like to leave you a family.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.560
You are all I need.

36:20.960 --> 36:24.600
But in 60, 70 years,
I'll be gone

36:26.320 --> 36:29.120
and you will live on
for centuries,

36:29.280 --> 36:31.040
maybe millennia.

36:43.320 --> 36:45.120
Diana.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.880
The women in this family

36:49.040 --> 36:51.360
manage their own finances.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.120
Thank you.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.720
This ring

36:59.880 --> 37:02.920
was Ysabeau's message to me.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.880
A seal of her approval.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.840
Here, wear this.

37:17.520 --> 37:20.480
And I will be with you always.

37:22.320 --> 37:27.200
As you will always be
in my heart.

37:29.560 --> 37:31.440
My daughter.

37:37.120 --> 37:40.840
I will ride with you
to the edge of the estate.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.800
Matthew.

38:10.720 --> 38:14.280
You have found a woman
who is worthy of you.

38:14.440 --> 38:20.440
With enough courage
and hope to spare.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.480
Yes, I know.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.720
And know this.

38:25.880 --> 38:28.800
You are equally worthy of her.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.360
So stop regretting your life,

38:35.520 --> 38:37.520
and start living it.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.360
And there is one more matter

38:43.520 --> 38:45.840
to be put to rest
before you leave.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.520
Whatever happens between
the two of us in the future...

38:53.280 --> 38:55.320
...I forgive you.

39:04.800 --> 39:08.080
Now, go...

39:09.320 --> 39:11.200
...my son.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.680
Thank you, Father.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.640
Go on now.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.720
<i>My dearest Ysabeau,</i>

40:18.880 --> 40:21.760
<i>at last,</i>
<i>I am able to find words</i>

40:21.920 --> 40:26.280
<i>to straddle the centuries</i>
<i>that separate us.</i>

40:26.440 --> 40:29.600
<i>The language</i>
<i>has eluded me until now</i>

40:29.760 --> 40:33.920
<i>for I have struggled</i>
<i>to accept my mortality.</i>

40:40.640 --> 40:45.520
<i>But today, I have finally</i>
<i>found the inspiration,</i>

40:45.680 --> 40:48.040
<i>for I am at peace,</i>

40:48.200 --> 40:50.800
<i>and I am no longer</i>
<i>afraid of my fate,</i>

40:50.960 --> 40:55.600
<i>for fate retains the power</i>
<i>to surprise us.</i>

41:17.600 --> 41:22.560
<i>Our son is happy at last.</i>

41:23.520 --> 41:28.960
<i>Mated to a woman who walks</i>
<i>in the footsteps of the goddess.</i>

41:34.680 --> 41:36.640
<i>They journey now to Bohemia</i>

41:36.800 --> 41:40.280
<i>in search of The Book of Life.</i>

41:40.440 --> 41:43.760
<i>And I fear there are</i>
<i>difficult times ahead.</i>

41:47.640 --> 41:49.800
<i>And that I trust</i>
<i>they will return to you</i>

41:49.960 --> 41:53.560
<i>and that together you will</i>
<i>forge a bold new future</i>

41:53.720 --> 41:55.880
<i>for our family.</i>

41:57.160 --> 42:01.400
<i>This is my final message</i>
<i>to you, my love.</i>

42:01.560 --> 42:05.280
<i>I know now that</i>
<i>there shall come a day</i>

42:05.440 --> 42:08.360
<i>when we will be parted.</i>

42:08.520 --> 42:13.120
<i>But until then,</i>
<i>as in the afterlife,</i>

42:13.280 --> 42:17.320
<i>I will hold you in my heart.</i>

43:08.240 --> 43:13.040
<i>His Imperial Majesty Rudolf II</i>
<i>tires of Elizabeth's ambassadors.</i>

43:13.200 --> 43:15.160
I would speak with her
subject, Edward Kelly.

43:15.320 --> 43:17.440
I know what you are, vampire.

43:17.600 --> 43:20.400
Rudolf thinks the book is key
to creating the philosopher's stone.

43:20.560 --> 43:21.960
He won't let Kelly take it.

43:22.120 --> 43:24.280
Once the emperor sets
his heart on something,

43:24.440 --> 43:26.760
he'll stop at nothing to get it.

43:26.920 --> 43:29.440
Is there any part of your collection
you keep from the public eye?

43:29.600 --> 43:31.560
Is there something
in particular you wish to see?

43:31.720 --> 43:35.400
<i>It begins</i>
<i>with opposites and desire,</i>

43:35.560 --> 43:37.400
<i>blood and fear.</i>

43:37.560 --> 43:42.280
It begins with
the discovery of witches!
