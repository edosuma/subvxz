00:03.447 --> 00:05.797
by two separate yet equally
important groups:

the police,
who investigate crime,

00:07.755 --> 00:10.584
and the district attorneys,

against you--

I was wrongfully charged,

I have never had non-consensual

My mission in life is to make
sure that those responsible

00:46.359 --> 00:50.102
for this travesty of justice
are held accountable.

only one victim, Nicole.

there wasn't a lot of evidence.

So Nicole sued him.

could depose him.

he was released.

41:05.297 --> 41:09.127
Every woman on
that jury hates me.

41:09.171 --> 41:13.654
Right now, I'm just another man
victimizing Nicole Bell.

41:16.526 --> 41:21.313
We need
to reframe the argument.

41:29.757 --> 41:33.761
You told me a story

41:33.804 --> 41:36.154
a while back

41:36.198 --> 41:38.505
about your family.

41:41.638 --> 41:44.685
- You're saying you want me
to deliver the closing?

41:49.472 --> 41:51.561
I'm a prosecutor.

41:51.605 --> 41:54.695
I'm sworn to enforce
the laws of this state.

41:54.738 --> 41:59.874
Yet I understand the
defendant's desire for revenge,

41:59.917 --> 42:01.876
for street justice.

42:03.747 --> 42:09.536
Nine years ago, my sister was
raped and murdered in Georgia.

42:09.579 --> 42:12.321
Police never arrested
the offender.

42:12.364 --> 42:14.584
But I knew who did it.

42:14.628 --> 42:17.892
Police knew, too.
Just couldn't prove it.

42:19.633 --> 42:23.898
So it's easy to understand
the defendant's rage,

42:23.941 --> 42:26.465
her desire for vengeance,

42:26.509 --> 42:29.338
her need for this son
of a bitch to pay

42:29.381 --> 42:30.469
for what he did to her,

42:30.513 --> 42:33.385
to suffer like
he made her suffer.

42:35.605 --> 42:38.608
When Henry King was
released from prison,

42:38.652 --> 42:41.959
the defendant's thirst
for revenge escalated.

42:42.003 --> 42:46.790
Maybe she even began
to fantasize about killing him.

42:46.834 --> 42:49.837
Pictured herself
grabbing a gun,

42:49.880 --> 42:53.057
going to his house,
waiting for him to show up.

42:53.101 --> 42:56.626
She probably even planned
what she was going to say,

42:56.670 --> 42:59.281
where she was
going to shoot him.

43:02.458 --> 43:06.288
Those types of fantasies
are perfectly normal.

43:06.331 --> 43:08.464
Trust me.

43:08.507 --> 43:11.249
They're also perfectly legal.

43:11.293 --> 43:15.602
But to actually take the life
of another human being...

43:15.645 --> 43:17.734
to wait outside
someone's house

43:17.778 --> 43:20.563
and shoot him five times
in cold blood...

43:20.607 --> 43:24.915
that's not only wrong,
that's criminal.

43:26.830 --> 43:30.181
Just--just because
you're suffering

43:30.225 --> 43:31.835
and you're filled with anger

43:31.879 --> 43:33.968
doesn't mean you get
to play God.

43:35.883 --> 43:37.754
Now that doesn't mean
you shouldn't

43:37.798 --> 43:40.496
have tremendous sympathy
for the defendant,

43:40.539 --> 43:43.455
that you shouldn't
appreciate the pain

43:43.499 --> 43:47.285
and the suffering she endured.

43:47.329 --> 43:50.637
So, when you go back
to the jury room to deliberate,

43:50.680 --> 43:53.683
give yourself permission
to feel sorry for her.

43:55.729 --> 43:57.469
But that doesn't
mean she's innocent,

43:57.513 --> 44:00.516
that she should walk free.
