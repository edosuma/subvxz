00:06.920 --> 00:08.880
[intense music]

00:36.000 --> 00:37.880
[music continues]

01:06.040 --> 01:08.120
[music continues]

01:23.200 --> 01:24.480
[camera clicks]

01:32.840 --> 01:34.000
[Billie]Morning, Sarge.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.600
Morning. Who's this?

01:36.760 --> 01:40.640
Uh, business card says
Aaron Samuelsons, locksmith.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.400
Lambeth address.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.000
Blood on the brickwork
behind him suggests

01:44.160 --> 01:45.960
probable cause of
death as head injury

01:46.120 --> 01:48.040
after being slammed
into the wall.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.960
Someone really didn't
like this Aaron Samuelson.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.480
Tallies with his wallet
still being in his pocket,

01:53.640 --> 01:55.560
this wasn't a robbery.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.160
The phone isn't
password protected.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.360
It looks like the majority
of the calls are from

02:01.520 --> 02:03.960
a Stacey Ford, work and home.

02:04.120 --> 02:08.160
Presumably, this is her.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.680
Have I seen him before?

02:10.840 --> 02:13.560
Dunno, might be on the system.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.760
Gambling man,

02:15.920 --> 02:17.760
maybe had a run in with
someone he owes money to.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.960
Mmm, maybe not.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.440
Okay, Billie and I will
go and break the news

02:22.600 --> 02:25.120
to this Stacey Ford,
can you finish up here?

02:25.280 --> 02:26.720
Yeah, of course.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.200
[intense music]

02:41.360 --> 02:44.000
Aaron Samuelson was
called out on a pay as you go,

02:44.160 --> 02:46.960
no subscriber details and it
was only used for one call.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.680
-So, it was a set up?
-Mmm.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.560
[laptop chimes]

02:52.240 --> 02:55.040
Billie thought she might
recognize our victim.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.960
She was right.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.120
This could get personal for her.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.760
[intense music]

03:14.280 --> 03:16.200
[sniffs]

03:16.360 --> 03:22.480
Um... Aaron got a call out,
an emergency one, you know?

03:22.640 --> 03:25.600
Um, someone locked
themselves out of their car

03:25.760 --> 03:29.560
and he was all up about
it 'cause it's easy money.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.520
Called them his bill payers.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.640
[sniffs]
What time was this?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.960
Um...

03:39.120 --> 03:43.280
I was heading out for work,
I start at 10:00,

03:43.440 --> 03:46.440
well I'm a cleaner,
I do the night shift.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.000
So, um...

03:50.160 --> 03:51.960
9:15.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.640
Yeah, yeah, that's
the last time I saw him.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.240
We found a card for a gambler's
support group in his wallet.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.320
What?

04:00.480 --> 04:03.760
Would you know
if he was in debt?

04:03.920 --> 04:08.640
Aaron wasn't a gambler.
He was a decent man.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.920
He kept himself to himself
and he barely went out.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.840
If we ever argued about
anything, it was that.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.920
He could stay in all week.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.760
No fall outs with family?

04:19.920 --> 04:21.720
[Stacey]He didn't have any.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.120
What about friends?

04:25.080 --> 04:29.160
Aaron moved down from
Lincoln two years ago, three.

04:31.240 --> 04:34.120
Worked for himself, not much
chance to make new friends.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.520
How did you two meet?

04:39.680 --> 04:42.640
The way everyone
meets, online.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.680
[intense music]

05:00.880 --> 05:03.560
We just spoke to the
girlfriend and got nothing.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.640
Maybe a bit too much of nothing.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.760
Aaron Samuelson
had no family or friends.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.160
Anywhere on the
financial records?

05:10.320 --> 05:11.640
Just about to fill the boss in.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.200
Why don't we, uh,
go into my office?

05:17.360 --> 05:19.600
Billie, can you line up what
we know so far, please?

05:19.760 --> 05:21.520
Uh, sure, boss.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.160
If this is about the
Chief Superintendent,

05:29.320 --> 05:31.160
I'm still thinking about the
best way to approach him.

05:31.320 --> 05:34.080
It's not about Mulgrew.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.920
-Rob.
-It's about Billie.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.040
Aaron Samuelson isn't
our victim's real name.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.640
His fingerprints are a
match for a Leon Renton,

05:41.800 --> 05:44.880
in the system for minor
shoplifting when he was 18.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.280
Okay.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.280
Leon Renton was the key witness

05:48.440 --> 05:50.760
for the prosecution in the
trial against an old school mate

05:50.920 --> 05:53.000
of his called Kit Hughes.

05:53.160 --> 05:57.680
Hughes was convicted of
manslaughter ten years ago.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.880
Am I supposed to know that name?

06:00.040 --> 06:01.600
It's who Hughes killed.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.760
[intense music]

06:19.200 --> 06:20.920
[David]Billie.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.400
I recognize the victim.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.200
[Billie]His name isn't
Aaron Samuelson,

06:24.360 --> 06:25.760
it's Leon Renton.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.880
He testified against the
guy that killed my dad.

06:31.280 --> 06:32.440
But you already knew that.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.040
[intense music]

06:40.760 --> 06:45.600
This is Kit Hughes, he got
12 years for manslaughter.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.680
What happened?

06:47.840 --> 06:49.640
My dad was walking
through Dalston

06:49.800 --> 06:53.240
when he saw these two,
Kit Hughes and Melanie Palmer,

06:53.400 --> 06:55.040
giving Leon Renton a kicking.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.680
And he stepped in?

06:58.840 --> 07:02.920
Yeah, next thing, Kit Hughes
went for my dad.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.200
Dad hit his head on
the pavement and died.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.840
Did your dad know any of them?

07:09.960 --> 07:11.440
He taught all three

07:11.600 --> 07:13.840
when they were at school,
a couple of years before.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.960
Why manslaughter, not murder?

07:17.120 --> 07:19.920
Hughes claimed in court
that it was self defence,

07:20.080 --> 07:21.400
that my dad hit him first.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.040
What did Leon Renton testify?

07:25.200 --> 07:27.000
Leon swore that Kit Hughes
provoked my dad

07:27.160 --> 07:29.360
by whispering
something that set him off.

07:29.520 --> 07:34.000
And if Hughes was provoked,
it was manslaughter, not murder.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.880
What did Hughes whisper?

07:36.040 --> 07:39.880
Leon didn't hear what he said,
which meant it was disregarded.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.560
Why were Kit Hughes
and Melanie Palmer

07:41.720 --> 07:43.440
attacking Leon
in the first place?

07:43.600 --> 07:46.760
That never came
out, even at the trial.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.520
Surely, Leon Renton's
murder has nothing

07:48.680 --> 07:50.320
to do with my dad's case?

07:50.480 --> 07:52.640
Kit Hughes is still inside.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.720
Billie,

07:54.880 --> 07:57.920
Kit Hughes got early release
from prison, three weeks ago.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.600
[intense music]

08:05.240 --> 08:07.760
I'm sure your mum's fine.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.720
If Kit Hughes is
settling scores,

08:09.880 --> 08:13.320
my mum's the one who persuaded
Leon to testify against him.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.920
[sighs]
Voicemail.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.480
Is that usual?

08:17.640 --> 08:19.360
Sometimes she forgets
to turn her phone on,

08:19.520 --> 08:22.640
she's not answering
at home either.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.080
Why don't you go and see her?
Put your mind at rest.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.960
-Thank you.
-I'll drive her.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.680
They said my dad had
a massive brain bleed.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.240
Kit Hughes left him
to die on the street,

08:41.400 --> 08:44.240
I was in double maths.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.560
School secretary
came in with the head,

08:46.720 --> 08:50.200
took me outside, I thought
what have I done this time?

08:50.360 --> 08:51.400
But I could tell by
the look on their faces,

08:51.560 --> 08:53.880
something terrible has happened,

08:54.040 --> 08:57.960
then I saw my mum,
down the corridor.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.880
It's fine. Come on.

09:01.640 --> 09:02.880
[breathes heavily]

09:04.720 --> 09:07.160
Chief Superintendent?

09:07.320 --> 09:09.000
-Sergeant.
-Can I have a word?

09:10.880 --> 09:13.320
[sighs]
Jack.

09:13.480 --> 09:16.200
Um, now that we're working
in the same building

09:16.360 --> 09:18.720
and after all that we went
through.

09:18.880 --> 09:22.200
Hmm, not the best way to
describe our marriage, is it?

09:22.360 --> 09:27.160
No. Well I wondered if we should
go for a drink or something?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.320
Yes, I-I-I'd love that. Um...

09:33.480 --> 09:34.840
Tonight suit you?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.040
Yeah, great.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.080
Looking forward to it.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.440
[intense music]

09:51.160 --> 09:54.600
I've got a date tonight
with my ex-husband.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.080
Thanks. I know this isn't easy.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.080
It's worth finding
out what Kit Hughes

10:02.240 --> 10:04.720
has been up to
since his release.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.200
-And Melanie Palmer.
-I'll get onto it.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.160
How did your mum
persuade Leon Renton

10:16.320 --> 10:18.400
to give evidence
against Kit Hughes?

10:18.560 --> 10:20.680
Just... she knew
his mum through church,

10:20.840 --> 10:24.040
they, they both put pressure
on Leon to do the right thing.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.080
This is it, stop, stop here.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.960
[intense music]

10:40.080 --> 10:41.480
[bell buzzing]

10:48.440 --> 10:51.240
[knocking]
Mum! Mum!

10:51.400 --> 10:54.320
-No keys?
-No, they're in my flat. Mum?

10:54.480 --> 10:55.400
She might just be out, you know?

10:55.560 --> 10:57.240
[knocks]
Mum?

10:57.400 --> 11:00.040
She's not answering her mobile,
she's not calling me back.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.360
Mum!

11:01.520 --> 11:02.720
Hang on, you... Are you sure...

11:02.880 --> 11:04.480
[glass shatters]

11:08.160 --> 11:10.440
Mum?

11:10.600 --> 11:13.600
Mum? Mum, it's me.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.280
[intense music]

11:27.040 --> 11:28.480
She's not here.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.080
-I've called the police.
-Mum?

11:35.240 --> 11:37.520
Mum, where have you been?
Why is your phone off?

11:37.680 --> 11:39.400
You scared the hell out of me.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.480
You broke in?
I thought I'd been burgled.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.960
I mean... What on earth?

11:46.120 --> 11:47.840
You were off the grid, Mrs F.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.520
Billie was having a
bit of a mare over it.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.480
Sorry about the glass,
we'll sort something out.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.600
Mare about what?
What's happened?

11:56.760 --> 11:57.920
Mum.

12:03.120 --> 12:07.280
Mum... it's Kit Hughes.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.040
-He's been released.
-Well, I know that.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.600
I just don't understand
what that's got to do

12:11.760 --> 12:13.520
with you breaking my window.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.320
You knew Kit Hughes was out?

12:15.480 --> 12:19.200
Yes, I had a call from
the probation service.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.040
I thought about
telling you, but...

12:21.200 --> 12:23.280
You thought?

12:23.440 --> 12:25.400
What the hell, mum?

12:25.560 --> 12:28.240
I better cancel
your mum's 999 call.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.600
Billie, I'll let the
Detective Inspector

12:29.760 --> 12:31.440
know that everything's alright.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.040
-Good to see you again, Mrs F.
-You too, Rob.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.120
[sighs]

12:39.280 --> 12:40.120
Cup of tea?

12:40.280 --> 12:41.840
[intense music]

12:59.360 --> 13:01.080
[Marsha]That's exactly
why I didn't say anything.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.320
I didn't want you
reliving everything.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.080
So you'd rather I just
bumped into Kit Hughes

13:07.240 --> 13:08.520
on the street then?

13:10.160 --> 13:12.240
You must've known
with good behaviour,

13:12.400 --> 13:14.520
he was near the
end of his sentence, so

13:14.680 --> 13:16.120
why discuss the obvious?

13:16.280 --> 13:17.680
Why discuss anything at all?

13:20.720 --> 13:21.880
[sighs]

13:24.480 --> 13:28.080
Leon Renton was found
murdered this morning.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.760
I think it might've
been Kit Hughes.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.040
I can't believe it.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.000
I'm sorry.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.120
I know you had a lot of respect
for Leon and him for you.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.240
Leon's dead

13:45.400 --> 13:49.160
and you're saying that you
know it was Kit that did it?

13:49.320 --> 13:50.680
He's a suspect.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.440
Oh, no.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.600
No, that doesn't make sense,

13:54.760 --> 13:58.240
Kit's only just been released,
he changed in prison.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.120
That's what the
probation report said.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.200
Some people can make
you believe anything, mum.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.080
[intense music]

14:18.280 --> 14:21.200
Can you detail your
whereabouts for yesterday?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.920
I spent the day with
my dad at his place.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.120
That's where I've been paroled.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.240
I went to evening
worship at 6:00

14:28.400 --> 14:30.520
and I met my outreach
worker here at 7:00.

14:30.680 --> 14:31.960
He asked me to be
part of a group session

14:32.120 --> 14:33.720
with some of the kids.

14:33.880 --> 14:37.040
We got talking after and
I've got a 10:00 pm curfew,

14:37.200 --> 14:39.520
so he let me sleep on the
sofa in his flat next door.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.640
He's out at the moment,
but do you want his number?

14:42.800 --> 14:44.040
Please.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.760
Have you had any
contact with Leon Renton

14:47.920 --> 14:49.560
or Melanie Palmer
since your release?

14:49.720 --> 14:53.160
Nah, nothing.
Please, check my phone.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.760
Do you have more than one phone?

14:54.920 --> 14:56.560
Nope.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.360
It's a shock, Leon's death.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.120
I've obviously thought about
him a lot when I was in prison

15:02.280 --> 15:05.040
and nowadays, after ending
my penance, he's dead, it's...

15:08.040 --> 15:10.880
Look, I did a terrible thing to
Mike Fitzgerald and his family.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.880
I intend to spend
my life making up for it.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.560
I've swept away your
offences like a cloud,

15:16.720 --> 15:19.120
your sins like the morning mist,
return to me for I've--

15:19.280 --> 15:20.960
For I have redeemed you.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.080
I would like your phone

15:26.240 --> 15:28.400
so that I can transfer
the data on to this laptop,

15:28.560 --> 15:30.160
with your permission.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.000
Of course,
I'm just happy to help.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.360
[intense music]

15:47.240 --> 15:48.960
[Billie] How was it?

15:49.120 --> 15:53.040
Uh, well, he's found God and
you know, each to their own, but

15:53.200 --> 15:54.360
he's wearing that a bit thick.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.760
How about an alibi
for last night?

15:56.920 --> 16:00.520
His outreach worker said that
he was at the centre all evening

16:00.680 --> 16:02.320
and that he stayed with
him between 10:00 at night

16:02.480 --> 16:03.320
and 7:00 in the morning.

16:03.480 --> 16:04.960
Seriously?

16:05.120 --> 16:06.920
We might have to
accept that Kit Hughes

16:07.080 --> 16:08.720
has nothing to do with it.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.400
Sarge, Hughes is clever.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.480
I'm sorry, Billie, but as
regards any evidence,

16:13.640 --> 16:15.920
the guy's in the clear.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.240
Uniform have just got
Melanie Palmer out of bed,

16:18.400 --> 16:19.840
she's on her way in.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.440
I'm Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole

16:27.600 --> 16:30.880
and this is Detective Inspector
David Bradford.

16:31.040 --> 16:34.720
Can you tell us when
you last saw Leon Renton?

16:34.880 --> 16:36.480
[scoffs]
Years ago.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.240
He moved away, didn't he?

16:38.400 --> 16:40.680
He moved back
two, three years ago.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.160
Last night,
someone murdered him.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.760
What, do you think I had
something to do with it?

16:48.920 --> 16:52.920
I never even saw him, I've
never killed anyone, that's mad.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.440
No, but you stood back
while other people got killed.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.240
Can you tell us what
you were doing between

17:01.400 --> 17:04.560
10:00 pm yesterday
and 7:00 am today?

17:06.680 --> 17:08.360
Bottle of vodka and a movie.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.040
So that's me.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.280
Get a lie detector test if you
want, but I didn't kill no one.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.160
[intense music]

17:20.720 --> 17:22.200
[sighs]

17:25.760 --> 17:27.320
What?

17:29.920 --> 17:31.400
It's Hughes' mobile,

17:31.560 --> 17:33.120
there's calls to your
mum and vice versa.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.080
What, so my mum's gonna
be treated as suspect now?

17:42.240 --> 17:45.320
No, your mum's gonna be
treated like a relevant witness

17:45.480 --> 17:47.680
who hasn't told us
all that she knows.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.000
Rob, invite Mrs. Fitzgerald
in for interview, please.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.720
[Rob]Boss.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.640
[intense music]

18:04.840 --> 18:07.520
Oh, if only to
finally see the place.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.960
-Thanks for coming in, Mrs. F.
-You're welcome, Rob.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.840
Though I did have
to ask a neighbour to

18:13.000 --> 18:14.640
keep an eye on my front door.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.200
Sorry, we'll sort
that a glazier.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.440
I brought something in,

18:19.600 --> 18:21.760
didn't know but you
like a biscuit, don't you?

18:21.920 --> 18:23.200
Thank you.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.160
The Detective Inspector
won't be long.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.080
-Right.
-Please, take a seat.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.400
Your mum brought biscuits.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.240
[intense music]

18:46.880 --> 18:48.440
Oh.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.880
Thanks.

18:52.480 --> 18:53.760
Mmm.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.240
How can I help you?

18:56.960 --> 18:58.480
I've asked you to
come in because

18:58.640 --> 19:02.080
we're investigating the
murder of Leon Renton.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.080
And because you
made an impression

19:04.240 --> 19:06.600
on Leon that led him to give
evidence against the man

19:06.760 --> 19:08.760
who was responsible
for your husband's death.

19:08.920 --> 19:11.240
I understand.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.760
Good.

19:15.640 --> 19:19.880
Had you seen Leon Renton
since he came back to London?

19:20.040 --> 19:22.760
He came to see
me about a year ago.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.000
You haven't seen him or
talked to him since then?

19:26.480 --> 19:28.160
No.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.200
But you have had
contact with Kit Hughes?

19:32.640 --> 19:33.960
Yes.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.480
What were those
conversations about?

19:38.640 --> 19:41.600
They were about his
work at the outreach centre,

19:41.760 --> 19:46.280
living with his father and
his feelings about the past.

19:51.360 --> 19:54.760
You know, Billie and I,

19:54.920 --> 19:57.960
we both had to find our own ways
to deal with her dad's death.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.240
Hmm.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.400
She stayed angry
and I understand that,

20:02.560 --> 20:06.560
but... I just couldn't cope.

20:06.720 --> 20:12.320
Waking up, every day to
that awful, gut wrenching rage.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.640
I knew I had to find a different
way if I was gonna get through.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.360
Hmm.

20:20.520 --> 20:24.720
And I didn't think
Billie would understand.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.560
So, that's why I kept
these things from her,

20:27.720 --> 20:30.720
not because I have anything
to hide, but because...

20:33.760 --> 20:35.640
it was the only way
I could go on with my life.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.560
During your dealings
with Kit Hughes,

20:43.720 --> 20:48.040
can you recall any comments
or feelings he expressed

20:48.200 --> 20:49.560
about Leon Renton?

20:51.800 --> 20:53.960
Only remorse,

20:54.120 --> 20:57.120
about what happened
that day to my husband,

20:57.280 --> 20:58.600
Billie's father.

21:00.280 --> 21:03.200
And during your dealings
with Leon Renton,

21:03.360 --> 21:05.440
did he ever mention

21:05.600 --> 21:08.240
what the original
fight was about?

21:08.400 --> 21:10.440
The one my husband
tried to stop?

21:10.600 --> 21:11.840
Yes.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.200
Well...

21:17.200 --> 21:19.400
I don't suppose the truth
can hurt anyone now.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.800
[intense music]

21:27.880 --> 21:30.960
A week before
Mike Fitzgerald was killed,

21:31.120 --> 21:32.840
three people on mopeds

21:33.000 --> 21:36.440
robbed a security guard outside
a jewellers in Bethnal Green.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.040
They struck it lucky,

21:38.200 --> 21:42.440
the guard was carrying
jewellery worth nearly 50 grand.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.160
The guard wasn't
quite so fortunate,

21:45.320 --> 21:47.640
one of the gang cracked
him over the head

21:47.800 --> 21:50.200
and he was in
hospital for a month.

21:50.360 --> 21:52.520
So, these three on
mopeds, was that

21:52.680 --> 21:55.440
Hughes, Palmer and
the third one our victim?

21:55.600 --> 21:59.720
Billie's mum told me Leon Renton
claimed he had no part of it.

22:01.720 --> 22:05.840
According to Leon,
Kit Hughes and Melanie Palmer

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
accused him of finding out where
they'd stashed the proceeds.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.640
And then stealing them.

22:11.800 --> 22:12.920
That's what they
were fighting about

22:13.080 --> 22:15.000
when Billie's dad found them?

22:15.160 --> 22:17.200
50 grand's worth of jewellery,

22:17.360 --> 22:20.960
takes a lot of patience
to sit on that for ten years.

22:21.120 --> 22:25.880
What if Leon had started to
sell it and someone found out?

22:26.040 --> 22:27.880
[intense music]

22:36.400 --> 22:37.680
I checked in with
pawn brokers local

22:37.840 --> 22:40.760
to Leon Renton and Stacey Ford,

22:40.920 --> 22:43.440
one of them was offered
a yellow diamond ring

22:43.600 --> 22:45.240
couple of weeks ago.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.960
The guy didn't take it because
there was no provenance,

22:48.120 --> 22:50.960
he was concerned it
might've been stolen,

22:51.120 --> 22:52.600
so he kept the CCTV.

22:56.760 --> 22:57.880
Stacey Ford.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.800
[intense music]

23:09.400 --> 23:11.360
So, Stacey,

23:11.520 --> 23:15.160
you were arrested on suspicion
of handling stolen goods.

23:15.320 --> 23:19.920
When you were searched,
this ring was found in your bag.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.520
The ring matches
one that was stolen

23:21.680 --> 23:25.600
from a jewellers in
Bethnal Green, ten years ago.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.160
It looks like the same ring.

23:31.080 --> 23:34.960
Did Leon find out you
were selling his stash?

23:35.120 --> 23:36.520
He never knew.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.560
[Vivienne]There was
a reason that Leon

23:39.720 --> 23:43.480
still had that jewellery
after ten years.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.160
Putting that on the
market and selling it

23:45.320 --> 23:46.920
would've drawn
attention to himself

23:47.080 --> 23:48.920
and proved that he
took it in the first place.

23:52.480 --> 23:56.160
I'm showing
Miss Ford Exhibit RB23,

23:56.320 --> 24:00.920
a rucksack that was found during
a search on her home address.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.520
The bag contain two items

24:03.680 --> 24:08.720
that also match those that
were stolen in a robbery.

24:08.880 --> 24:14.360
Exhibits RB24 and RB25.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.600
I owed a grand, yeah?

24:16.760 --> 24:19.680
That first necklace
I stole got me 700 quid.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.600
So, you're the one with
the gambling problem?

24:25.200 --> 24:27.040
I kept selling

24:27.200 --> 24:30.320
and I kept gambling until there
was just these three items left.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.880
Then what happened next?

24:34.280 --> 24:36.760
If I were you, Stacey,
I'd do everything you can

24:36.920 --> 24:38.880
to help us catch the person
that killed Leon.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.160
Uh...

24:44.320 --> 24:46.960
My pawnbrokers
weren't interested,

24:47.120 --> 24:50.760
one said he'd put the
word about for a percentage.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.200
When he sent out
the photo of the ring,

24:52.360 --> 24:54.520
I was amazed he
heard back so quickly.

24:54.680 --> 24:56.600
What was the arrangement?

24:56.760 --> 24:59.880
[sniffs]
Uh, we met in a cafe in Hackney

25:00.040 --> 25:02.120
three days ago.

25:02.280 --> 25:03.360
Did you take the ring?

25:03.520 --> 25:04.680
No...

25:04.840 --> 25:06.840
uh-huh-huh, just
to talk about money,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.840
I-I-I wanted to see
if I could trust her.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.040
Her?

25:12.200 --> 25:14.120
What was her name?

25:14.280 --> 25:18.280
She called herself Alex,
said she was owed the ring,

25:18.440 --> 25:22.880
said she knew Leon of old
guessed I was his girlfriend.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.360
She said I had to
give the ring to her

25:24.520 --> 25:27.240
or someone would get hurt.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.200
I'm supposed to be
meeting her today,

25:29.360 --> 25:33.480
she text me this
morning, she still wants it.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.720
Then you're gonna meet her.

25:35.880 --> 25:38.840
[scoffs]
No. No, no I can't do that.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.480
[intense music]

26:00.920 --> 26:02.120
Detective?

26:02.280 --> 26:05.120
Detective Constable Fitzgerald.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.400
-You're?
-Marsha's daughter.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.320
Mike Fitzgerald's
daughter, yeah.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.760
I heard you were
a police officer.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.400
Yeah, in conversations
with my mother.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.880
In prison and since your release
and then they're gonna stop,

26:17.040 --> 26:19.480
do you understand me?

26:19.640 --> 26:20.760
I do.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.320
I think Marsha's
found them useful, but--

26:22.480 --> 26:24.680
Stay away from my family.

26:24.840 --> 26:28.120
Look, I don't wanna cause
any of you any more pain,

26:28.280 --> 26:29.640
I never expected
any forgiveness,

26:29.800 --> 26:30.920
your mum, she's a blessing.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.800
Shut up, just shut up.

26:34.840 --> 26:37.000
What did you say to my dad that
made him so angry that night,

26:37.160 --> 26:40.520
provoked him into having a
go at you before you killed him?

26:40.680 --> 26:42.960
I didn't say anything.
Leon was lying.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.320
You're the one who's lying.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.880
Whatever you said meant you
got away with murdering my dad,

26:48.040 --> 26:50.000
'cause that's what
this was, murder.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.040
-Look, I'm sorry for what I did.
-Stay away from my mum.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.520
[intense music]

27:07.560 --> 27:09.200
Billie.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.840
-Do you have a minute?
-Yeah.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.160
Sit down.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.520
You alright?

27:29.680 --> 27:30.960
Has there been a complaint?

27:32.560 --> 27:35.320
About?

27:35.480 --> 27:37.320
I did something
I shouldn't have done.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.600
Well it hasn't reached me.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.080
Will it?

27:43.640 --> 27:45.880
I went to see Kit Hughes,

27:46.040 --> 27:48.000
to warn him off
contacting my mum.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.640
No one want this for you.

27:53.800 --> 27:58.200
I'd probably camped
outside his door myself but

27:58.360 --> 28:02.480
don't sacrifice your
career over him.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.520
Your dad wouldn't
have wanted that.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.280
We haven't got any evidence,

28:10.440 --> 28:16.760
no forensic, no DNA or prints
that put Hughes at the scene

28:16.920 --> 28:19.640
and he has an alibi.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.040
He's not a suspect.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.160
Yes, sir.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.080
Go and spend some
time with your mum.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.200
And no detours.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.600
[chuckles]

28:31.760 --> 28:33.200
Thank you.

28:40.280 --> 28:43.480
Why is she not here?

28:43.640 --> 28:47.000
Calm down, give it time.
You've got something she wants.

28:50.440 --> 28:53.920
David told me you're meeting the
Chief Superintendent tonight.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.080
How are you feeling about that?

28:56.240 --> 28:58.520
Well, there's a
lot riding on it.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.520
Safety of your family for one.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.320
Yeah, my family are safe.
I'll make sure of that.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.040
Yeah, but you can't see them.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.160
Do you really believe
the Chief Super's

29:08.320 --> 29:11.240
linked to these three murders?

29:11.400 --> 29:15.000
He's not a killer, I know that.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.000
But he's weak, I believe
he's been manipulated.

29:20.520 --> 29:21.760
So what are you
planning on saying to him?

29:21.920 --> 29:24.120
Well, I wish I knew.

29:24.280 --> 29:25.920
Let's hope you're right

29:26.080 --> 29:30.160
and whatever he's got himself
into, he wants a way out.

29:30.320 --> 29:35.240
How much longer? I told
you I don't want to do this.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.720
Now take it easy,
remember to get her talking,

29:38.880 --> 29:40.560
dig a hole for herself.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.200
We're just over the road.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.440
Surprise, surprise,
Melanie Palmer.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.120
Stacey, stop talking, start
playing with your phone,

29:46.280 --> 29:47.720
she's just walking in.

29:51.280 --> 29:54.640
-You brought it?
-Yeah.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.280
[Melanie]Well, hurry up then.

29:59.440 --> 30:02.880
Why don't you make
it a bit more obvious?

30:03.040 --> 30:05.600
So you're not gonna hurt me
now, like you did Leon, right?

30:05.760 --> 30:07.720
I mean you got what you wanted.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.720
[Melanie]What?

30:09.880 --> 30:11.080
[Stacey]Nothing.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.080
Leon's dead.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.800
I heard.

30:15.960 --> 30:17.400
Keep quiet about this

30:17.560 --> 30:19.920
and then I won't have
to come and find you.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.760
I'd have liked a bit
more of a confession.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.280
What about my money?

30:25.440 --> 30:27.520
I told you,
it wasn't yours to sell.

30:27.680 --> 30:30.840
[Melanie]It was mine,
Leon was greedy,

30:31.000 --> 30:32.960
should've finished
him off ten years ago.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.080
That's good enough for me.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.000
She's leaving, she's got it.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.200
[Melanie]Who you talking to?

30:38.360 --> 30:39.920
[dramatic music]

31:06.640 --> 31:08.600
Try me.

31:08.760 --> 31:11.160
-Give me your hands.
-I'm gonna search you.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.480
Can I go now?

31:23.640 --> 31:25.280
Not yet.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.120
[intense music]

31:48.640 --> 31:51.040
Melanie Palmer, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of the murder

31:51.200 --> 31:52.120
of Leon Renton.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.160
You what?

31:53.320 --> 31:55.280
And for handling stolen goods.

31:55.440 --> 31:58.120
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

31:58.280 --> 31:59.440
if you do mention when...

31:59.600 --> 32:00.960
[intense music]

32:09.520 --> 32:12.520
We're not that bothered about
a ten year old robbery, Melanie.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.040
If you had nothing to
do with Leon's murder,

32:15.200 --> 32:16.480
tell us the truth.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.480
Okay.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.160
We robbed the jewellery.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.960
But your lot showed up,

32:31.120 --> 32:36.560
so we all went different
ways, Leon had the bag...

32:38.120 --> 32:39.640
he reckoned he
ditched it in the chase.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.160
Yeah, right.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.600
I owed a lot of money back then.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.480
I was desperate.

32:51.640 --> 32:54.120
So I helped Kit beat Leon up.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.480
And what about now?

32:58.640 --> 33:01.440
Why would I kill Leon?

33:01.600 --> 33:03.600
Finally getting my
share of the job.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.720
Listen, I'm not the one
who ended up doing time

33:11.880 --> 33:13.400
for killing that teacher.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.560
Are you talking
about Kit Hughes?

33:17.720 --> 33:20.120
-He could never let anything go.
-What do you mean?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.760
[scoffs]

33:24.920 --> 33:26.560
[sighs]

33:26.720 --> 33:30.960
Mr. Fitzgerald got Kit expelled
from school, for violence.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.520
And then, there we were,

33:35.680 --> 33:39.400
giving Leon a kicking,
for ripping us off,

33:39.560 --> 33:43.720
suddenly, Mr. Fitzgerald's
coming out of nowhere,

33:43.880 --> 33:45.800
trying to stop Leon from
getting his head kicked in.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.760
Kit just starts laughing
in his face, taunting him.

33:54.080 --> 33:56.360
About?

33:56.520 --> 33:58.320
Oh, um...

33:58.480 --> 34:00.160
Mr. Fitzgerald's
teenage daughter.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.160
Saying what he'd like
to do to her and that.

34:06.640 --> 34:07.680
[sighs]

34:09.880 --> 34:12.200
[intense music]

34:12.360 --> 34:14.440
Mum! Mum!

34:17.320 --> 34:19.400
I've got a guest.

34:19.560 --> 34:20.960
We talked about this.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.400
I got fed up waiting for
your lot to fix this window,

34:23.560 --> 34:25.640
so I asked Kit to come
and help me patch it up.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.360
Welcome to come in.

34:35.560 --> 34:39.480
Mr. Fitzgerald, he just, he
goes crazy, screaming at Kit

34:39.640 --> 34:42.360
to keep his hands
off his daughter.

34:42.520 --> 34:46.560
Which gave Kit an excuse
to really put the boot in.

34:49.280 --> 34:52.160
I mean, like he said after,
he'd been waiting a long time to

34:52.320 --> 34:54.080
wipe the smile off
Fitzgerald's face.

34:57.600 --> 35:03.040
Kit Hughes puts himself out as
a reformed character these days.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.760
He has an alibi,

35:06.920 --> 35:09.280
his outreach worker vouched for
him at the time of the murder.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.000
Grant Jennings?

35:14.360 --> 35:15.920
What?

35:16.080 --> 35:17.960
[chuckles]

35:18.120 --> 35:19.640
He's Kit's cousin.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.520
-I wanted a chat.
-Well, let's have a chat.

35:30.520 --> 35:34.960
Oh, Billie, what do you want,
huh?

35:35.120 --> 35:36.480
Can you not see that this...

35:38.480 --> 35:40.600
makes me happy?

35:40.760 --> 35:42.400
Your mother's a
very spiritual person.

35:42.560 --> 35:45.000
This is not a conversation
that you're a part of.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.480
We have to share what's inside

35:46.640 --> 35:48.840
or we can't
understand each other.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.520
Do you have to talk like that?

35:51.680 --> 35:53.600
It matters.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.440
I'm sorry, but it means
something to me

35:55.600 --> 35:58.840
that Kit wants to talk
about who he is now.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.160
It mattered to me that
Leon got a decent job,

36:02.320 --> 36:04.680
all that responsibility after

36:04.840 --> 36:08.440
everything in his past, that
he could share that with me.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.160
Mum, did you meet with Leon?

36:13.480 --> 36:15.240
Grant Jennings and
Kit Hughes are cousins,

36:15.400 --> 36:16.920
but with different surnames.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.840
Something Kit Hughes
neglected to mention.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.440
So, Kit Hughes' alibi for
the murder of Leon Renton.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.440
Is looking decidedly shaky.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.560
I'll get Hughes picked
up on suspicion of murder

36:25.720 --> 36:27.280
and perverting the
course of justice.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.280
You told my Detective Inspector

36:31.440 --> 36:33.480
you hadn't seen Leon
in a year, did you lie?

36:38.040 --> 36:40.280
Of course I didn't lie.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.960
After I'd spent
time talking to Kit,

36:42.120 --> 36:44.160
I had a yearning to
go and speak to Leon,

36:44.320 --> 36:46.480
I went to Leon's
house but he wasn't in.

36:50.240 --> 36:52.160
When was this, mum?

36:52.320 --> 36:53.720
Yesterday.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.000
I phoned Kit Hughes' dad,

37:02.160 --> 37:04.240
he isn't there and he hasn't
been back to the centre.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.760
[male #1]Control, officer
requiring urgent assistance,

37:08.920 --> 37:10.360
Belford Road, E14.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.600
That's Billie's mum's address.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.000
[intense music]

37:17.400 --> 37:19.480
Did he ask you where
he could find Leon?

37:19.640 --> 37:22.320
[Kit]I would never ask
Marsha for that.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.920
You went to Leon's house, mum?

37:24.080 --> 37:26.720
Well, yes, and only because
I wanted Leon to know

37:26.880 --> 37:30.840
how different Kit was,
that he had nothing to fear.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.280
Mum, he followed you,

37:33.440 --> 37:34.880
he saw Leon's car
that he was a locksmith

37:35.040 --> 37:36.320
and he called
him out last night.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.680
Kit, you played my mum,
so you could get to Leon

37:38.840 --> 37:39.760
and then you killed him,
didn't you?

37:39.920 --> 37:42.160
No, it's not true.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.120
Look, maybe I should just go.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.040
Look, no. Wait.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.880
Billie, please, stop this,

37:49.040 --> 37:50.840
Billie, please,
listen to me, please.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.120
[male #1]Control, officer
is confronting murder suspect,

37:56.280 --> 37:58.760
the name Kit Hughes.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.600
-Please. Just wait a minute.
-Mum. Mum.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.360
Wait a minute, Kit.
You don't understand.

38:03.520 --> 38:04.960
-Mum.
-He's try...

38:05.120 --> 38:07.280
Please, just wait a
minute, okay? Billie, please.

38:07.440 --> 38:08.920
Mum, I can't.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.760
-Get away from the door.
-Leave her alone.

38:10.920 --> 38:14.800
-Get away from the door.
-Just put the knife down, Kit.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.000
Get away from the door.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.560
Don't know what
you want from me.

38:18.720 --> 38:21.440
Oh, be quiet. Tell your
daughter to do the right thing.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.160
-I welcomed you into my home.
-Do the right thing.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.080
[male #1]Units
attending, Belford Estate,

38:29.240 --> 38:31.240
suspect has a knife.

38:31.400 --> 38:34.080
Okay, Kit, I'm moving
away from the door, alright?

38:38.240 --> 38:39.880
-Now leave.
-Oh!

38:40.040 --> 38:41.520
[intense music]

38:48.360 --> 38:51.000
Suspect exiting
Carters Estate, E14.

38:58.560 --> 39:00.040
Argh!

39:07.040 --> 39:08.600
Please, help me.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.880
Please, help me.

39:18.320 --> 39:19.640
You gotta help me.

39:21.360 --> 39:24.040
Billie! Billie!

39:24.200 --> 39:26.000
Are you alright?

39:26.160 --> 39:27.880
It's gonna be alright, mate,
it's alright, it's alright.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.040
Right, just stay calm,
yeah? Stay calm.

39:32.240 --> 39:33.880
Billie!

39:34.040 --> 39:36.280
Ambulance message,
Carters Estate.

39:36.440 --> 39:37.560
Detective Constable Fitzgerald.

39:37.720 --> 39:38.840
[male #2]Received.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.240
Practice breathing.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.640
[intense music]

39:58.360 --> 40:00.400
-Alright?
-Hey.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.600
Kit Hughes is out of surgery.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.760
And with the evidence we've got,

40:07.920 --> 40:10.840
he'll be going down
for Leon's murder.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.560
[Rob]Like he should've
done for your dad's.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.040
Good.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.840
We're looking after your mum,

40:19.000 --> 40:20.400
she was a little shaken up.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.720
Don't know what
I'm gonna say to her.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.560
There's naive
and then there's...

40:28.520 --> 40:30.040
Just be there, I reckon.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.360
I don't know what I would've
done if you hadn't shown up.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.800
I wanted him to die.

40:42.920 --> 40:45.320
I wanted him to feel the life
draining out of him like my dad.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.520
I'm no better than him.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.760
You're a copper.

40:52.920 --> 40:55.160
And you're decent.

40:55.320 --> 40:59.280
And he's a lowlife who
deserved what he got.

40:59.440 --> 41:00.720
And you would've
done the right thing.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.520
[intense music]

41:14.680 --> 41:17.280
Going my way?

41:17.440 --> 41:19.120
Um... sure.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.000
[music continues]

41:43.680 --> 41:45.880
Thanks.

41:46.040 --> 41:47.840
They do food here,
if you're hungry.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.440
You always did like tapas.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.160
This isn't a social occasion.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.600
Really?

41:56.760 --> 41:58.720
Well, when you said
let's go for a drink

41:58.880 --> 42:01.200
after all we've
been through, I uh...

42:01.360 --> 42:03.960
assumed you wanted
to talk about us.

42:05.920 --> 42:07.520
Why on earth would
I wanna do that?

42:12.520 --> 42:14.400
Yeah, I'll say one thing
about you, Vivienne,

42:14.560 --> 42:17.280
you may be a
cold-hearted bitch, but

42:17.440 --> 42:20.160
at least you're consistent.

42:20.320 --> 42:23.880
When you said it's over,
it was over,

42:24.040 --> 42:25.680
didn't see you for dust.

42:27.800 --> 42:30.280
Do you really not know what
it is I wanna talk to you about?

42:30.440 --> 42:31.880
[intense music]

42:37.560 --> 42:38.960
You should go.

42:42.880 --> 42:45.880
And if anyone were to see us,

42:46.040 --> 42:48.280
you're just having a
drink with your ex-wife,

42:48.440 --> 42:49.800
for old time's sake.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.480
And what are we really doing?

42:55.720 --> 43:01.680
Well, um, I'm a police officer,
helping a fellow officer

43:01.840 --> 43:03.840
who, I suspect, is in a
whole load of trouble.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.800
Not here, darling.

43:14.280 --> 43:17.520
No, I know, I know, don't
worry about that now.

43:17.680 --> 43:21.160
I was thinking, shall I pick
up some fish and chips?

43:21.320 --> 43:23.560
Yeah, like dad used to.

43:23.720 --> 43:26.400
Take away treat night
special, yeah.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.560
Okay, just wait for me,

43:28.720 --> 43:31.640
I've... yeah, I'll phone you
when I'm on my way up.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.920
Okay, see ya.

43:34.080 --> 43:37.600
Billie, I wanted to say,

43:37.760 --> 43:40.440
your instincts were good.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.600
I didn't go about
it the right way.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.360
I know today's
been hard, just...

43:45.520 --> 43:47.200
make sure you learn from it.

43:47.360 --> 43:49.240
Thank you, sir. Goodnight.

43:53.880 --> 43:54.960
[intense music]

44:01.640 --> 44:03.200
Vivienne's gone to meet Mulgrew.

44:06.840 --> 44:08.240
Do you think she can
persuade him to talk?

44:11.480 --> 44:13.920
Well, if she can't,
I don't know who can.

44:16.360 --> 44:18.440
Time was you couldn't
stand the Sarge.

44:18.600 --> 44:21.960
-What's changed?
-I got to know her.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.800
Vivienne is one of
the best detectives

44:23.960 --> 44:24.880
I've ever worked with.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.120
Oh, I could've told you that.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.840
Well you know me,
Rob, slow on the uptake.

44:33.360 --> 44:36.320
So, tell me what
you think you know.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.600
Well, as you may recall,

44:38.760 --> 44:41.040
a young police
officer, Tyler Bates,

44:41.200 --> 44:45.400
was murdered outside a pub
in Poplar nearly a year ago.

44:45.560 --> 44:48.640
We have reason to believe
that the killer

44:48.800 --> 44:51.080
is a serving police officer.

44:51.240 --> 44:52.560
Go on.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.440
Grace Harper,
who was the landlady of the pub

44:54.600 --> 44:57.640
where Constable Bates
was killed, she saw who did it

44:57.800 --> 44:59.960
and she was prepared
to identify the killer,

45:00.120 --> 45:01.040
but then she was murdered too

45:01.200 --> 45:03.000
while she was in
police protection.

45:03.160 --> 45:05.520
Her brother-in-law,
Harry Steadman, told someone

45:05.680 --> 45:07.840
that the killer would
never be caught,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.560
because he had
friends in high places.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.640
And then he was murdered.

45:12.800 --> 45:15.040
That is three people dead, Jack.

45:15.200 --> 45:19.240
Three, murdered by
a serving police officer.

45:19.400 --> 45:22.360
You have to tell me
who that officer is.

45:22.520 --> 45:23.960
Help us put a stop to this.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.040
No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

45:32.040 --> 45:33.280
I don't know you anymore.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.720
-This Grace Harper.
-Yes.

45:37.880 --> 45:40.200
You said she was killed while
she was in police protection?

45:40.360 --> 45:42.680
She was, someone in
the force told the killer

45:42.840 --> 45:44.240
where she was hiding out.

45:47.680 --> 45:50.280
It was you.

45:50.440 --> 45:51.880
Wasn't it?

45:56.080 --> 46:00.760
In my experience,
it takes a great deal

46:00.920 --> 46:03.960
to persuade someone
to turn supergrass,

46:04.120 --> 46:06.600
especially when one such
witness has already been killed.

46:08.560 --> 46:10.400
Now if David Bradford

46:10.560 --> 46:12.520
wants anybody to inform
on this corrupt officer,

46:12.680 --> 46:14.920
he'd better be offering
something totally cast iron

46:15.080 --> 46:16.880
in return.

46:17.040 --> 46:19.960
I guarantee the next
informant won't end up dead.

46:24.520 --> 46:28.200
-I'll talk to David.
-Yeah.

46:28.360 --> 46:29.680
You do that.

46:31.200 --> 46:32.680
It's gonna be okay.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.760
Wish I could believe you.

46:41.160 --> 46:43.760
-You don't know it was him.
-Don't I?

46:43.920 --> 46:47.360
You better do something
quick, otherwise I'm dead.

46:47.520 --> 46:50.240
Now that he's seen us
together, we both are.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.480
