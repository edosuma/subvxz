I am an icon.

- Angelyne?

00:31.448 --> 00:32.615
Read it.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.537
- Oh, I don't think
that that's a very good i--

00:37.579 --> 00:38.788
- Read it.

"The mystery of
LA billboard diva Angelyne's

00:47.172 --> 00:50.675
"real identity
is finally solved,"

00:50.717 --> 00:55.847
by Jeff Glaser
of "The Hollywood Reporter."

00:55.889 --> 00:59.559
"Way before Paris Hilton
and Kim Kardashian,

00:59.601 --> 01:02.145
"the enigmatic
blonde bombshell

"has remained secret

02:10.714 --> 02:12.007
- Who is she?

02:15.385 --> 02:16.886
- All right.

02:53.256 --> 02:56.551
<i>- Mysterious billboards are</i>
<i>popping up around the city</i>

02:56.593 --> 02:57.969
<i>featuring the striking image</i>

02:58.011 --> 03:00.055
<i>of a blonde</i>
<i>with a single name,</i>

03:00.096 --> 03:01.556
<i>Angelyne,</i>

03:01.598 --> 03:03.475
<i>raising the question</i>


03:03.516 --> 03:04.893
<i>who is Angelyne,</i>

03:04.934 --> 03:08.063
<i>and what exactly</i>
<i>is she advertising?</i>

03:08.104 --> 03:09.773
- What do I think she does
by looking at it?

03:09.814 --> 03:12.567
- Actually, I did hear that she
was trying to be a star

03:12.609 --> 03:14.444
and that she bought
all these billboards

03:14.486 --> 03:15.779
trying to be a star.
Am I right?

03:15.820 --> 03:17.739
- Angelyne,
why are you famous?

03:17.781 --> 03:20.408
- I'm famous
for being on billboards.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.327
- Angelyne!
<i>- I see her sometimes.</i>

03:22.369 --> 03:23.995
<i>I saw her ride by in her car,</i>

03:24.037 --> 03:26.664
and she was just paying
maximum attention

03:26.706 --> 03:28.458
<i>to the people on the sidewalk,</i>

03:28.500 --> 03:30.168
<i>just, you know, showing up.</i>

03:30.210 --> 03:31.419
- Ooh.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.005
- The one, the only Angelyne.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.262
- Angelyne finally decided

03:41.304 --> 03:43.348
all those billboards
weren't enough,

03:43.390 --> 03:45.266
<i>so she put up</i>
<i>this ten-story-tall</i>

03:45.308 --> 03:46.810
<i>mural of herself</i>

03:46.851 --> 03:48.353
<i>at the corner</i>
<i>of Hollywood and Vine.</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:52.315
It was there for six months
and cost more than $50,000.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.652
<i>- The mystery of Angelyne</i>
<i>has become a media obsession,</i>

03:55.694 --> 03:57.028
although she outright refuses

03:57.070 --> 03:59.781
to tell you anything
about her past.

04:04.285 --> 04:07.664
- People have a lot of opinions
about who you are.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.208
How would you
describe yourself?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.294
- I'm a Rorschach test in pink.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.422
Ooh.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.966
An innocent little doll

04:18.008 --> 04:19.509
or a whore

04:19.551 --> 04:21.344
or a porn star.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.389
People see...

04:24.431 --> 04:26.474
what they see.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.435
- I love Angelyne

04:28.476 --> 04:31.104
for all the same reasons

04:31.146 --> 04:34.774
the extremes, the weirdness,
the glamour, the enigma.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.193
- There's something sexy
about a mystery.

04:37.235 --> 04:40.030
That's why everybody
wants to know my story.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.614
- Back then,
you could still disappear

04:41.656 --> 04:44.117
or reappear as someone else.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.827
You can't really
do that anymore.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.788
Angelyne existed at a point
in American history

04:48.830 --> 04:50.331
when that was still possible.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.833
- Everyone wants
to interview her.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.669
They're doing a story about
the history of Los Angeles.

04:54.711 --> 04:55.837
They're doing a story about

04:55.879 --> 04:58.214
the greatest sex symbols
of our time.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.675
They want
to interview Angelyne.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.385
- Who is Angelyne really?

05:02.427 --> 05:04.512
What's her story?
Where is she from?

05:04.554 --> 05:06.181
That's what I set out to learn,

05:06.222 --> 05:07.557
and I was successful.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.642
- Jeff Glaser
turned out to be...

05:11.394 --> 05:13.646
A liar, and I hate liars.

05:14.898 --> 05:18.068
He was just biting
at the ch--

05:18.109 --> 05:20.195
mm, whatever you call it

05:20.236 --> 05:21.571
to get the story.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.116
- So the story isn't true?

05:36.086 --> 05:38.546
- Hey, Jeff,
here are those photos

05:38.588 --> 05:41.049
you asked for of Angelyne.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.509
- Thank you.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.887
- Yeah, she was in a band
called Baby Blue in the '70s.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.932
That guy's name right there
is Cory Hunt.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.059
- Cory?

05:51.101 --> 05:53.061
Oh.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.231
Cory's dead.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.941
- I am not dead.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.944
Of course
she would say that, man.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.404
You know why
she would say that?

06:02.445 --> 06:05.448
Because I created Angelyne.

06:08.952 --> 06:12.247
Does she know
you're talking to me?

06:12.288 --> 06:13.998
- Did I say Cory was dead?

06:15.667 --> 06:17.419
Well, he doesn't live
in LA anymore.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.130
I sometimes
get the two confused.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.007
- God's honest truth?

06:22.048 --> 06:24.968
This whole Angelyne story
starts with me.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.264
She was nothing before me.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.463
- He's probably gonna
tell you some story

07:01.504 --> 07:05.342
about how he saved me
or discovered me,

07:05.383 --> 07:06.968
and if that'll make him happy,
he can do that.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.303
But the truth is,
when I met him,

07:08.345 --> 07:12.640
I was already quite busy
modeling and acting.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.477
But the characters
weren't reflective

07:15.518 --> 07:19.731
of who I am on the inside,
so...

07:19.773 --> 07:22.067
I had a different plan.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.658
<i>- I was looking for a band</i>
<i>that wasn't going anywhere,</i>

07:30.700 --> 07:32.494
<i>one that I could mold.</i>

07:32.535 --> 07:34.079
<i>That's how I discovered him.</i>

07:34.120 --> 07:35.747
Coca-Cola, please.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.001
<i>- They were nothing much</i>
<i>to look at,</i>

07:40.043 --> 07:42.253
<i>but that's okay,</i>
<i>'cause no one was looking.</i>

07:43.380 --> 07:45.006
<i>I will never forget</i>
<i>that night.</i>

07:45.048 --> 07:47.342
<i>We had a residency</i>
<i>at the Starwood.</i>

07:47.384 --> 07:49.844
<i>We were already gaining</i>
<i>a ton of buzz.</i>

07:49.886 --> 07:52.555
<i>There was cosmic energy</i>
<i>in the air that night.</i>

07:57.936 --> 08:00.188
We have been
and we will always be

08:00.230 --> 08:01.940
Baby Blue.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.109
Thank you, and good night.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.193
- You guys rip, man!

08:05.235 --> 08:06.695
- Hey, Cory, great show.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.864
- Mm-hmm.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.033
<i>- And that's</i>
<i>when I discovered her,</i>

08:12.075 --> 08:16.287
<i>this divine creature</i>
<i>from outer space.</i>

08:18.456 --> 08:20.041
I'll be right back.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.545
<i>I never saw anything</i>
<i>so beautiful.</i>

08:28.258 --> 08:30.552
So what did you think
of the band?

08:30.593 --> 08:32.470
- What band?

08:32.512 --> 08:34.389
- Mine.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.890
We were just onstage.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.101
- Oh, was that you?
I wasn't listening.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.728
How'd you do?

08:39.769 --> 08:41.271
- We were incredible.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.734
We were fine.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.819
- If you're aiming
for just fine,

08:47.861 --> 08:50.947
you'll probably end up
just missing it.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.574
You gotta aim higher.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.575
- Yeah, I know.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.077
I mean, this place is not bad,

08:56.119 --> 08:58.538
but we really should be
playing the Whisky.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.875
- Then you gotta play every
show as if it's the Whisky,

09:01.916 --> 09:03.668
and one day...

09:03.710 --> 09:04.836
It will be.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.672
- Can I buy you a drink?

09:07.714 --> 09:09.049
- I don't drink...

09:10.425 --> 09:11.926
Or smoke.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.971
- Who are you?

09:16.598 --> 09:18.099
- Angelyne.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.811
Yeah, my dad, right,

09:21.853 --> 09:23.730
he's got this whole
Soviet work ethic

09:23.772 --> 09:25.940
where you just work
your whole life

09:25.982 --> 09:28.109
and you expect nothing,

09:28.151 --> 09:30.320
but I say what's the point
of living if you aren't...

09:30.362 --> 09:31.613
Following your dreams.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.115
- Yeah, yeah.

09:34.157 --> 09:38.078
Yeah, so I said, "No,
I'm not gonna live like that."

09:38.119 --> 09:39.829
So I packed up all my shit.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.456
I fled to LA,

09:41.498 --> 09:42.957
started a band.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.044
I mean, I've played every club
around here.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.631
Eventually I'm gonna
play the Whisky.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.092
That'll prove him wrong,
you know?

09:53.051 --> 09:56.721
- Fathers can ruin your life.

09:57.555 --> 10:00.475
- So what about you?
Are you close with your dad?

10:00.517 --> 10:03.561
- Oh, I never knew him.
He died when I was a baby.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.854
- Oh.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.440
I'm sorry.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.026
Your mom?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.071
- What's your sign?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.532
- Aquarius.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.536
- No wonder you're a rebel.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.496
- Hey, wait.
Where you going?

10:21.538 --> 10:23.206
- Home, of course.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.586
- She'd occasionally
share things about herself

10:28.628 --> 10:30.130
to gain sympathy,
but when it comes

10:30.171 --> 10:32.757
it the actual truth
about her past,

10:32.799 --> 10:35.343
no, she never went there.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.345
Hey, hey, wait up.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.806
You know how many freaks
and weirdos are out here?

10:39.848 --> 10:41.558
You could get
your head chopped off.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.769
- Don't worry, Daddy.
I'm stronger than I look.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.479
- No, but you--

10:46.521 --> 10:47.939
- You shouldn't be walking.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.357
Hey, I work at a garage.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.277
I could help you
get a cheap car if you want.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.279
- Oh, I don't want
just any car.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.699
A car is supposed to be
an extension of you,

10:57.741 --> 10:59.034
your being.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.036
I want something fast

11:01.077 --> 11:04.164
so I can get away if I have to.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.124
- What would you need
to get away from?

11:07.459 --> 11:09.711
- Anyone, anything,

11:09.753 --> 11:11.504
I have to know I can escape.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.716
That's why I'm saving up
to buy my dream car,

11:14.758 --> 11:18.136
my very own Star 'Vette.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.763
- Star 'Vette.
- Mm-hmm.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.891
That's what Barbie
calls her Corvette,

11:22.932 --> 11:24.392
her dream machine.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.773
- Barbie the doll?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.900
- The American icon.

11:31.941 --> 11:35.195
I'd love to be like Barbie.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.656
- You're already blonde
and beautiful.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.909
- Oh, she's so much more
than that.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.578
She lives a painless existence.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.331
You can stick her with things,
and she won't cry.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.791
She doesn't hurt.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.795
Wouldn't that be nice,
never to hurt?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.758
- Yeah, I would never
let you get hurt.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.555
- Come on, Aquarius,

12:02.597 --> 12:04.474
we don't want
to get our heads chopped off.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.521
You know, pink is the color
of the Beverly Hills Hotel...

12:09.562 --> 12:13.775
- Okay.
- Jayne Mansfield's house...

12:13.817 --> 12:16.444
and my house.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.696
That's why I picked pink.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.406
<i>I came to Hollywood</i>
<i>to follow the dream.</i>

12:19.447 --> 12:22.283
I had to leave
everything behind

12:22.325 --> 12:25.954
in order to become
what I knew I needed to become.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.957
The season of change
is upon us.

12:28.998 --> 12:33.003
- Hey, candles
are a classy touch.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.671
Sets a nice vibe.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.047
- No, these are because...

12:36.089 --> 12:38.091
My asshole neighbor

12:38.133 --> 12:40.468
cut my power!

12:41.511 --> 12:43.388
I mean, she is--
whoo--

12:43.430 --> 12:46.641
evil, but no matter
what she does,

12:46.683 --> 12:47.684
she can't...

12:47.726 --> 12:49.185
Fucking hurt me

12:49.227 --> 12:52.355
because I will call
the goddamn cops!

12:54.691 --> 12:58.903
Anyway, this place
is a work in progress.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.031
I'm designing
a whole new look for it.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.158
- No, I love it.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.411
Yeah, especially
all these mirrors.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.706
Hey, is that the--

13:09.748 --> 13:12.542
- Oh, I don't let
anybody in there.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.210
That's my sanctuary.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.714
It's my cocoon.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.341
- Your cocoon?

13:19.382 --> 13:21.885
Jesus fucking--what the fuck?

13:21.926 --> 13:24.471
- That's my parrot.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.389
He's very jealous.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.849
Person.

13:27.891 --> 13:30.018
Ooh.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.811
You be nice.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.605
- Person?
- Yeah.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.566
He was here when I moved in,
so I adopted him.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.610
I called him Bird at first,
but...

13:39.944 --> 13:41.071
The more I got to know him,

13:41.112 --> 13:43.239
the more I realized
he's complex.

13:43.281 --> 13:46.409
- Oh, hey, this is...
- Marilyn.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.036
Yeah.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.330
She's my honorary mother.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.873
Since I was a little girl,

13:51.915 --> 13:54.876
I've known that fame
is my destiny.

13:54.918 --> 13:59.047
Huge, gigantic fame.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.719
Are you ready to do it?

14:04.761 --> 14:06.262
- Oh, God, yes.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.765
- Let's get famous together.

14:08.807 --> 14:11.059
I'll sing in your band,

14:11.101 --> 14:13.520
and we'll conquer the world.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.317
- So I asked her
to join my band.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.320
- So I asked him if he wanted
to play guitar in my band.

14:22.362 --> 14:26.074
- We made a pact that night
to get famous together.

14:27.784 --> 14:31.204
<i>Some weird witchy shit...</i>

14:32.497 --> 14:35.417
<i>But I was along for the ride.</i>

14:35.458 --> 14:39.546
- Marilyn needs an offering,
something personal.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.051
- It's my demo.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.178
- Marilyn loves music.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.471
It's perfect.

14:53.018 --> 14:57.230
Marilyn, you have known
sorrow and pain,

14:57.272 --> 14:58.773
and so have we,

14:58.815 --> 15:00.817
but our hearts are pure.

15:00.859 --> 15:04.779
Please guide us
in your footsteps on this Earth

15:04.821 --> 15:09.576
and light our way to the top,
where we were born to be.

15:11.202 --> 15:14.247
She wants us to formalize it
with our blood.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.849
Holy shit,
this is fucking intense.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.810
- Our destiny
is sealed...

15:35.852 --> 15:37.020
together.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.821
- Ew, gross.
That did not happen.

15:46.863 --> 15:51.201
And light our way to the top,
where we were born to be.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.830
- Holy shit.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.665
- Marilyn agrees, see?

15:57.707 --> 15:59.751
We should be
in a band together.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.175
Oh, my goodness,
wow, it is so late.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.344
- Okay.
- I have to dye my hair.

16:09.386 --> 16:10.845
Careful walking back
to your car.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.806
- Oh, I--
- Oh.

16:12.847 --> 16:13.807
Mwah.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.183
- Uh--

16:29.322 --> 16:31.157
- I know how to get
what I want from a man.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.827
The band was just
all part of my grand plan.

16:35.203 --> 16:38.206
- I mean,
she's a total paradox.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.959
I can't wait for you
to experience her.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.545
You know,
she dresses like a slut,

16:43.586 --> 16:46.256
but she sees herself
as innocent,

16:46.297 --> 16:47.465
and I know
what you're thinking,

16:47.507 --> 16:49.718
but it's not about that.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.845
You know, she's, like...

16:51.886 --> 16:54.014
super disciplined.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.850
She kicks me out of her house
every night at 10:00 p.m.

16:56.891 --> 17:00.520
to dye her hair
and take a bubble bath.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.232
She's a lot, man.

17:04.274 --> 17:07.235
- Yeah, but do we need
a singer?

17:07.277 --> 17:09.237
- We need her.

17:09.279 --> 17:12.240
- We need her or you need her?

17:12.282 --> 17:14.617
- Hey, guys,
I think we're being watched.

17:14.659 --> 17:17.662
- Hey, hey, don't worry.
Honestly, she's moldable.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.873
We just--we'll put her
where we want to put her.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.332
She's eye candy.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.835
All right, crowds will
eat that shit up.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.589
<i>- I met Cory a few years</i>
<i>before he met Angelyne.</i>

17:27.630 --> 17:30.508
Yeah, I remember he said he
went to Berklee School of Music

17:30.550 --> 17:32.677
but he left
because he was too good.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.097
Too good.

17:36.139 --> 17:39.225
Oh, but still, he had
true God-given talent.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.146
But when Angelyne came along...

17:44.606 --> 17:46.816
- She did a number on him.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.581
- Hey, Bud, Ray, meet Angelyne.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.834
- Hi, boys.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.212
Pleased, I'm sure.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.090
So we have to talk photos.

18:10.131 --> 18:12.842
I know what you're going for
with your old posters,

18:12.884 --> 18:15.720
the brick wall,
little-boy fake machismo.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.722
It's all a bit cliché,
though, no?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.392
Since we have to take
new photos anyway,

18:20.433 --> 18:23.561
I'm going to experiment
with a new look.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.190
The posters are key.
The posters are everything.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.942
- Yeah, but isn't it
about the music?

18:28.983 --> 18:30.985
- That's a ridiculous question.
No.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.029
Look, it's marketing 101.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.699
You could waste
years of your life holed up

18:35.740 --> 18:37.492
in a crummy rehearsal studio,

18:37.534 --> 18:39.953
writing your masterpiece
that no one will ever hear,

18:39.994 --> 18:43.331
or you can put
your masterpiece up--

18:43.373 --> 18:45.750
oh--around town,

18:45.792 --> 18:49.754
capture the city's attention,
and they'll be begging for it.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.715
These little punk clubs
are fine,

18:51.756 --> 18:54.884
but wouldn't the Whisky
be so much better?

18:58.221 --> 19:00.432
- Sorry.
- Sure.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.601
- And to that end,
five is better than four,

19:03.643 --> 19:06.563
so I put an ad
in "The Recycler"

19:06.604 --> 19:08.314
for a keyboardist.

19:12.235 --> 19:13.778
- I knew we were being watched.

19:13.820 --> 19:17.282
- That's Tim in the blue,
Freddy with the tie,

19:17.323 --> 19:19.075
Hector is in the glasses,

19:19.117 --> 19:22.454
and the balding one
is Keith or Kenneth.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.788
Anyway, I already have
my favorite,

19:23.830 --> 19:25.540
but feel free to look around.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.833
- Did you know about this?

19:26.875 --> 19:28.877
- I mean, it's actually
a pretty smart idea

19:28.918 --> 19:29.836
to add keys.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.259
Okay, suit yourself.
I'll pick.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.849
Nope, sorry.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.392
Nope, you can go.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.022
No.
No, no, no.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.150
Freddy.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.031
Welcome to Baby Blue.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.452
- She's great, isn't she?

20:04.746 --> 20:08.083
- The band...loved me.

20:26.184 --> 20:31.147
Are you ready for Baby Blue?

20:31.189 --> 20:32.857
Ooh.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.652
- One, two, three, four.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.471
- I'll be honest,
people definitely thought

21:44.512 --> 21:46.890
it was a joke at first.

21:46.931 --> 21:50.727
Nobody took her
very seriously, but...

21:50.769 --> 21:53.104
I knew what to do.

21:53.146 --> 21:56.149
<i>Every day, I would</i>
<i>take pictures of Angelyne.</i>

21:56.191 --> 21:57.442
- Lower.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.778
<i>- I must've taken thousands</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

21:59.819 --> 22:01.279
- There you go.
- Like this?

22:01.321 --> 22:02.447
- Mm-hmm.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.657
<i>Cory took photos, sure,</i>

22:04.699 --> 22:08.161
<i>but not the ones</i>
<i>everybody know.</i>

22:09.204 --> 22:10.663
- You're a wild animal.
- Back up.

22:10.705 --> 22:12.082
- Okay, sorry.
- Back up.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.376
<i>He never really had</i>
<i>a photographer's eye.</i>

22:14.417 --> 22:18.296
<i>- She'd always choose</i>
<i>the shitty overexposed shots</i>

22:18.338 --> 22:21.132
<i>so you didn't see</i>
<i>any of the flaws on her face.</i>

22:21.174 --> 22:24.636
<i>- Maybe he'd get one decent</i>
<i>shot out of a thousand.</i>

22:24.678 --> 22:26.012
- You're a movie star.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.723
<i>- Not the best track record,</i>
<i>if you ask me.</i>

22:28.765 --> 22:30.975
<i>- And I was right,</i>
<i>people were curious.</i>

22:41.361 --> 22:43.071
Love is strange, man.

22:43.113 --> 22:44.781
You know, you guys
will see it too.

22:44.823 --> 22:46.157
Good stuff is coming.

22:46.199 --> 22:47.742
I promise you.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.911
Like, real,
like...

22:49.953 --> 22:52.163
supernatural success.

22:52.205 --> 22:55.583
We are, like,
this close to, like, fucking

22:55.625 --> 22:57.585
getting on
that rocket ship, man.

22:57.627 --> 23:00.422
- You realize you're starting
to sound like Angelyne, right?

23:00.463 --> 23:02.632
- No, Angelyne,

23:02.674 --> 23:04.175
she's starting
to sound like me.

23:04.217 --> 23:05.677
- Is that what
you tell yourself?

23:05.719 --> 23:07.303
- Hey, come on.
Hurry up.

23:07.345 --> 23:08.847
We don't want
to be here all night.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.306
- We're working
our asses off, man.

23:10.348 --> 23:11.599
Where is she right now?

23:11.641 --> 23:13.268
- Ooh.

23:13.852 --> 23:17.856
- Man, she is super clean.

23:17.897 --> 23:21.401
- Hey, put up your posters.
Keep the beat. Believe.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.986
That's your job.

23:23.028 --> 23:26.281
Okay.

23:26.322 --> 23:29.242
<i>- I think Bud was a little bit</i>
<i>jealous of me and Angie</i>

23:29.284 --> 23:31.453
'cause of this powerful thing
that we had going on

23:31.494 --> 23:33.038
outside of the band, you know?

23:49.637 --> 23:52.057
- We have
to take them all down.

23:53.767 --> 23:56.144
Wait, what?

23:56.186 --> 23:57.771
- Yeah, no.

23:57.812 --> 24:00.899
- The printing
is awful and cheap.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.275
My thighs look massive.

24:02.317 --> 24:05.445
This is not what I look like,
is it?

24:05.487 --> 24:07.238
- I'd say it's pretty generous.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.406
- You don't know
what you're saying.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.824
Take them down.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.451
- What do you do for the band?

24:11.493 --> 24:13.119
I mean, I'm so curious.

24:13.161 --> 24:14.329
I mean, we've been
out here all night.

24:14.371 --> 24:16.998
Cory pays for the posters.
What do you do?

24:17.040 --> 24:19.000
- I am the reason
that people show up.

24:19.042 --> 24:20.877
You are replaceable.

24:22.337 --> 24:24.923
- Right.
Okay.

24:26.007 --> 24:28.176
You take them down.

24:28.218 --> 24:30.845
I'm gonna take a bubble bath.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.847
- Hey, Bud, come on, man.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.142
- Well?

24:38.353 --> 24:39.729
- Yeah, no, I'm--

24:41.648 --> 24:42.941
Yup.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.484
<i>- I get what I want.</i>

24:44.526 --> 24:45.944
That doesn't make me a brat.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.570
That makes me in control.

24:47.612 --> 24:48.988
- She had to go.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.074
We couldn't take it anymore.

24:51.116 --> 24:52.534
I think Cory was relieved.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.577
- I was pissed.

24:54.619 --> 24:58.998
But the guys had a point, so...

24:59.040 --> 25:00.542
I knew what had to be done.

25:06.631 --> 25:09.384
- Hey, how about we go out
for some tacos tonight?

25:09.426 --> 25:12.095
- You know I don't eat
on Tuesdays.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.181
- Well, can I at least
take you out somewhere?

25:16.474 --> 25:17.517
- There's just some stuff

25:17.559 --> 25:18.810
I really want
to talk to you about.

25:26.151 --> 25:28.111
That is good. I love that.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.946
- Hey, I should get off
around 3:00.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.906
How about we go out
for a test drive?

25:31.948 --> 25:33.533
Maybe up to Malibu?

25:33.575 --> 25:36.661
- Marilyn didn't rest
until she was famous.

25:36.703 --> 25:37.954
We need to stay focused.

25:37.996 --> 25:41.583
- Jesus Christ, Angelyne,
just listen to me.

25:44.961 --> 25:48.256
So the guys and I
have been talking,

25:48.298 --> 25:52.052
and we think
it might be time--ugh.

25:53.261 --> 25:55.764
This is really hard
for me, you know?

25:55.805 --> 25:58.141
There he is.

25:58.183 --> 26:00.769
Steve.
- What?

26:00.810 --> 26:03.271
- This is Cory.
Cory, this is--

26:03.313 --> 26:06.983
- Steve Hughes.
I book the Whisky.

26:07.025 --> 26:09.444
- So I was at El Coyote
yesterday with Freddy,

26:09.486 --> 26:13.365
and who does the universe
put at the table next to me?

26:13.406 --> 26:16.242
So we got to talking,
and not only does Steve handle

26:16.284 --> 26:18.119
the bookings for the Whisky.

26:18.161 --> 26:20.413
He also happens
to need his car fixed.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.460
<i>It was all part</i>
<i>of the grand plan.</i>

26:25.502 --> 26:27.212
find a band.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.506
play the Whisky.

26:29.547 --> 26:32.092
- Well, obviously we couldn't
kick her out anymore.

26:32.133 --> 26:33.968
I mean, you say what you will.

26:34.010 --> 26:36.638
Maybe she was
the devil in disguise.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.807
But that devil made it happen.

28:07.937 --> 28:10.440
- Crazy, you guys
were so awesome.

28:10.482 --> 28:12.150
- Yeah!

28:12.192 --> 28:14.819
- Whoo!
- Incredible!

28:14.861 --> 28:17.197
- Whoo!
- Oh, my God.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.284
- We fucking played that.

28:21.326 --> 28:22.285
- Told you!

28:22.327 --> 28:23.495
- I know! I know!
- Told you!

28:23.536 --> 28:24.621
- I know!

28:24.662 --> 28:25.955
I know. I know.

28:30.919 --> 28:32.671
Going in there too?

28:34.214 --> 28:36.591
- No, that's not really
my thing.

28:36.633 --> 28:37.926
You?

28:37.967 --> 28:39.928
- The crowd is my drug.

28:39.969 --> 28:41.346
Their love is like--

28:43.056 --> 28:45.475
It's like a natural high.

28:45.517 --> 28:47.769
- You were
really great tonight.

28:49.062 --> 28:50.355
- Was I?
- Mm.

28:50.397 --> 28:52.357
- That is so sweet of you.

28:53.900 --> 28:58.196
You, you were the glue
who held us all together.

28:59.531 --> 29:00.865
I don't think anyone's
ever said that

29:00.907 --> 29:03.535
about a keyboard player before.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.370
- Freddy...

29:05.412 --> 29:09.207
you are a good,
spirited person.

29:09.249 --> 29:14.629
Your body contains
a benevolent, calm energy,

29:14.671 --> 29:18.550
and that'll leave you open to
new and magical possibilities.

29:18.591 --> 29:19.718
You'll see.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.986
Oh, Freddy.

29:38.028 --> 29:40.113
<i>- All the greats</i>
<i>play the Whisky.</i>

29:40.155 --> 29:42.574
I mean, when I first
moved to LA,

29:42.615 --> 29:45.410
every night of the week,
I ended up seeing a show there.

29:45.452 --> 29:48.121
So to finally
get to play there,

29:48.163 --> 29:50.457
I mean, I felt like
I had made it, you know?

29:53.126 --> 29:55.337
Till about a week later.

30:02.427 --> 30:04.512
Hey, have you seen this shit?
- Language.

30:04.554 --> 30:05.722
- Uh,

30:05.764 --> 30:08.767
"The once-promising

"to sing or to strip.

I wanted to scream."

30:32.540 --> 30:35.543
Look, if I didn't like you,
I didn't like you.

30:36.670 --> 30:39.339
We should cut this out
and frame it.

30:39.381 --> 30:41.257
- What are you--
are you fucking crazy?

30:41.299 --> 30:44.636
- This is our first review.
- We're a joke.

30:46.096 --> 30:48.181
- We are being written about.

30:48.223 --> 30:49.724
That is a huge deal.

30:49.766 --> 30:50.725
- What?

30:50.767 --> 30:52.227
There's nothing good
about this.

30:52.268 --> 30:55.563
- There is good in everything.

30:56.356 --> 30:58.525
It's all about
what you choose to see.

30:58.566 --> 31:00.443
- That's not how life works.

31:00.485 --> 31:02.487
You don't get
a bunch of chances.

31:02.529 --> 31:04.698
I mean, this was,
like, our only shot.

31:04.739 --> 31:08.493
- You need to get into
a "so what" mentality.

31:08.535 --> 31:10.912
I am in a place
that is...

31:10.954 --> 31:12.455
filled with light.

31:12.497 --> 31:14.165
I feel good.

31:14.207 --> 31:16.334
- You're fucking delusional.

31:18.378 --> 31:21.256
I have worked so fucking hard,

31:21.297 --> 31:24.426
and this bitch comes around
and just fucks everything up!

31:24.467 --> 31:26.219
- I think if you need
to get into--

31:26.261 --> 31:29.180
- I, I, I!

31:29.222 --> 31:32.017
It's all about you

31:32.058 --> 31:33.685
all of the time.

31:33.727 --> 31:36.354
You've made this whole thing
about you.

31:36.396 --> 31:38.356
- That's because
it is about me.

31:38.398 --> 31:41.860
- You are a fucking black hole

31:41.901 --> 31:46.239
that sucks the life out
of everything that you touch.

31:53.913 --> 31:54.914
Fuck!

32:01.379 --> 32:03.048
- I feel good.

32:03.089 --> 32:06.051
<i>A lion never loses sleep</i>

32:06.092 --> 32:09.012
over the opinions of a sheep.

32:09.054 --> 32:13.683
If a reporter says
something bad about me,

32:13.725 --> 32:15.560
I just...

32:15.602 --> 32:17.771
keep rising up higher.

32:18.855 --> 32:21.066

away--

32:21.107 --> 32:23.026
and I was right at the edge--

32:23.068 --> 32:26.363
I'd always get pulled back
into that vortex, man.

32:27.906 --> 32:29.324
I mean, I believe it was

32:29.366 --> 32:32.535
my karmic responsibility
to take care of her.

32:32.577 --> 32:34.537
<i>I was meant to be with her.</i>

32:40.085 --> 32:41.503
Hey, Ang?

32:43.171 --> 32:44.964
- It's me. Open up.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.466
- I'm not home.

32:48.968 --> 32:50.595
- Come on, I messed up.

32:52.097 --> 32:53.682
I'm sorry.

32:53.723 --> 32:54.808
- Sorry?

32:56.267 --> 32:59.896
I don't believe in sorry.
Sorry doesn't mean anything.

33:00.647 --> 33:02.982
- Okay, well, how about
I show you, then?

33:17.330 --> 33:18.581
- Does this mean something?

33:20.333 --> 33:21.459
- Oh, my God.

33:21.501 --> 33:22.961
Oh, my God.

33:23.003 --> 33:24.004
Oh, my God.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.339
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

33:26.381 --> 33:28.049
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

33:28.091 --> 33:30.677
Oh, my God, Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

33:30.719 --> 33:33.805
Oh, my God.

33:33.847 --> 33:37.308
The color is all wrong,
but oh, my God, Cory.

33:39.436 --> 33:41.438
Just don't use it
to get away from me, okay?

33:43.773 --> 33:46.234
Yeah, I just want you
to be happy, Angie.

33:46.276 --> 33:49.946
- I am.

33:49.988 --> 33:52.907
Ooh.

33:52.949 --> 33:55.577
Oh, wow.

33:55.618 --> 33:58.163
- Beautiful, Angelyne...

34:00.415 --> 34:02.584
- Will you be my Mrs. Hunt?

34:04.544 --> 34:06.171
- Of course.

34:08.131 --> 34:09.591
- You will?

34:09.632 --> 34:13.219
- Oh, no, I meant of course
that's what this is.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.640
I don't believe in marriage.

34:30.195 --> 34:32.614
- Of course I kept the car.

34:32.655 --> 34:35.033
But marriage?

34:35.075 --> 34:37.243
Mm.

34:37.285 --> 34:40.372
Total suffocation.

34:40.413 --> 34:42.624
Why would I ever get married,
hmm?

34:42.665 --> 34:45.293
I'm sufficient enough
to myself.

34:59.057 --> 35:01.810
You want to take it
for a spin with me?

35:06.690 --> 35:08.441
Come on, Daddy.

35:14.030 --> 35:16.616
<i>- Man, people always</i>

35:22.956 --> 35:26.710

35:27.836 --> 35:29.462
You've never been in love.

35:33.216 --> 35:34.676
Hey, what can I say?

35:34.718 --> 35:37.929
I taught her the NY hustle,
and she learned it well.

35:37.971 --> 35:41.016
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I felt like I had to...</i>

35:41.057 --> 35:44.310

36:09.627 --> 36:12.297
We were supposed
to take photos.

36:12.339 --> 36:13.882
- I thought we were
supposed to practice.

36:13.923 --> 36:15.258
- And then take photos.

36:16.551 --> 36:17.761
- I don't know.

36:19.137 --> 36:21.014
Maybe...

36:21.056 --> 36:22.932
you've been
pushing him too hard.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.061
- Excuse me?

36:26.102 --> 36:28.021
- We all need a break
every once in a while.

36:28.063 --> 36:30.732
- I don't need a break.
Maybe you should take a break.

36:40.408 --> 36:42.077
- Sorry, Ang, he's my ride.

36:44.204 --> 36:45.830
- Be my guest.

36:49.459 --> 36:52.087
- I can do it.

36:53.296 --> 36:54.756
Um...

36:57.342 --> 37:00.303
I just got this the other day,
and I've been...

37:00.345 --> 37:02.639
meaning to try it...

37:03.640 --> 37:05.308
If that's okay with you.

37:09.562 --> 37:11.147
- Yeah.

37:11.189 --> 37:12.899
Okay.

37:12.941 --> 37:15.402
- Yeah, that's nice. Okay.

37:18.238 --> 37:20.865
<i>- There can only be</i>
<i>one top dog,</i>

37:20.907 --> 37:22.784
and I started to realize
that Angelyne and I

37:22.826 --> 37:24.828
couldn't both be it.

37:24.869 --> 37:27.706
You know, I didn't want
to compete with her,

37:27.747 --> 37:29.791
but I had to remember why

37:29.833 --> 37:32.460
I came out to LA

37:32.502 --> 37:36.047
to play and make music.

37:37.674 --> 37:39.884
I had to think of myself first.

37:54.774 --> 37:57.569
I'm just gonna play it again.

37:57.610 --> 38:00.530
Not as a producer...

38:00.572 --> 38:02.657
as a fan.
- Yeah?

38:02.699 --> 38:04.325
- Yeah, buddy.
- All right.

38:04.367 --> 38:07.162
- Let's crank it up, fellas.
- Whoo.

38:28.683 --> 38:32.979
<i>My "Wild Thing" cover</i>
<i>was the exact fresh take</i>

38:33.021 --> 38:34.606
<i>that people</i>
<i>were looking for, man.</i>

38:34.647 --> 38:38.026
I mean, KROQ, they put it
in their rotation immediately.

38:38.068 --> 38:40.570
It was a certified hit.

38:40.612 --> 38:42.864
I mean, you know, honestly,
I thought Angie

38:42.906 --> 38:44.991
would be happy for me,
you know,

38:45.033 --> 38:46.368
because that's
how relationships

38:46.409 --> 38:47.827
are supposed to go.

38:47.869 --> 38:52.207
You're supposed to...
support each other.

38:59.089 --> 39:00.215
- What are we doing?

39:00.256 --> 39:02.217
I told Freddy to meet
at El Coyote.

39:04.803 --> 39:06.721
- I have a surprise.

39:06.763 --> 39:08.848
Close your eyes.

39:08.890 --> 39:10.892
Promise you won't be mad.

39:10.934 --> 39:13.478
- No, of course
I'm not gonna promise that.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.106
- I know I've been MIA
the past few weeks,

39:16.147 --> 39:18.316
but it's been
for a really good cause.

39:19.693 --> 39:20.944
Come on.

39:23.613 --> 39:25.490
Come on.

39:27.534 --> 39:28.451
Right over here.

39:30.412 --> 39:31.830

Traitor.

39:56.855 --> 39:59.858

39:59.899 --> 40:01.735

40:01.776 --> 40:03.695
I'm just going first.

40:03.737 --> 40:06.489
Now I can help you.

40:06.531 --> 40:09.868
Hey, nobody says that you can't
get a billboard, too, someday.

40:12.746 --> 40:14.080
- What are you doing?

40:14.122 --> 40:16.291
- You betrayed me.

40:16.332 --> 40:18.960
- Oh, no, no, don't, don't.
Oh, fuck!

40:19.002 --> 40:21.629
Oh, you are fucking crazy.

40:21.671 --> 40:24.215
Damn it!
I'm done!

40:24.257 --> 40:26.634
I can't take it anymore!

40:26.676 --> 40:30.889
- We're done,
you fucking jealous lunatic!

40:43.026 --> 40:45.195
Sorry, I can't go on.

40:45.236 --> 40:47.947
A billboard for a cover song?

40:48.698 --> 40:51.701
Is this the story
you've been telling yourself?

40:51.743 --> 40:54.162
It's delusional.

40:54.204 --> 40:57.540
You were never
on a billboard...

40:59.959 --> 41:02.295
Or in a Chevelle.

41:03.672 --> 41:06.299
And when I broke up with you,

41:06.341 --> 41:08.885
it did not happen
on this street.

41:08.927 --> 41:10.428
Let's go.
- Do we have to?

41:10.470 --> 41:11.805
- Come on.

41:25.110 --> 41:28.279
You know what you did
and where I found you.

41:28.321 --> 41:29.447
Go.

41:52.929 --> 41:54.055
Action.

41:55.223 --> 41:56.933
How long has it been going on?

41:56.975 --> 41:58.435
- What do you mean?

41:59.936 --> 42:01.396
- How long?

42:01.438 --> 42:04.649
- Look, baby,
she's just a friend.

42:04.691 --> 42:07.360
Look, I don't even know her.

42:12.032 --> 42:14.534
- Wait a minute.
No, no, no, not my guitar!

42:14.576 --> 42:16.369
No, please!

42:16.411 --> 42:19.998
No, come on!
Stop! Stop! I'm sorry!

42:20.040 --> 42:22.500
Fuck!

42:22.542 --> 42:24.002
Please stop!

42:29.924 --> 42:31.259
You betrayed me.

42:31.301 --> 42:34.929
- I just--I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

42:34.971 --> 42:36.514
I love you.

42:37.515 --> 42:38.641
I love you.

42:44.981 --> 42:46.649
I love you, Angie.

42:49.778 --> 42:52.447
- I don't need you
to take care of me.

42:53.740 --> 42:56.117
This is my story.

42:56.159 --> 42:59.204
Don't you dare
try to make it about you.

43:00.789 --> 43:03.124
- No, no.

43:14.511 --> 43:19.140
- Cory can say whatever
he wants about his success

43:19.182 --> 43:21.559
but not the billboards.

43:21.601 --> 43:23.645
Those are mine.

43:23.687 --> 43:26.731
They've always been mine.

43:26.773 --> 43:28.983
- You either grow together,
or you grow apart,

43:29.025 --> 43:30.694
and she was growing apart.

43:32.654 --> 43:34.989
I mean, it was all about her,
and that's good.

43:35.031 --> 43:36.366
That's fine.

43:38.618 --> 43:42.497
Hey, I wrote about it all
in my novel.

43:42.539 --> 43:44.499
The audiobook
should be out soon.

43:44.541 --> 43:48.044
You know, people have been
comparing it to a...

43:48.086 --> 43:50.839
Shakespearean tragic comedy.

43:50.880 --> 43:53.008
<i>This tale...</i>

43:53.049 --> 43:58.221
tells the story of two souls

43:58.263 --> 44:00.515
thrown together by fate,

44:00.557 --> 44:05.061
mixed to a frappe
in the blender of life.

44:06.604 --> 44:08.773
<i>Those were crazy days, man.</i>

44:08.815 --> 44:11.026
But they were probably
the best years of my life.

44:13.778 --> 44:15.530
<i>- I loved him.</i>

44:15.572 --> 44:17.657
I did.

44:17.699 --> 44:20.869
But he loved me more.

44:25.331 --> 44:28.335
I'm too much for some people.

44:28.376 --> 44:33.131
I'm like uncut heroin.

44:33.173 --> 44:35.717
And it put him
in an institution.

44:40.847 --> 44:44.893
- I checked myself into rehab
to get away from her.

44:44.934 --> 44:47.604
You know, I had all these empty
vials of coke in my pocket,

44:47.645 --> 44:51.191
and they wouldn't commit me
unless I was an addict,

44:51.232 --> 44:53.443
so I said, "Here,"
and I took the vials out.

45:33.400 --> 45:37.153
- You look...different...

45:37.195 --> 45:39.948
good.

45:39.989 --> 45:41.616
- I feel good.

45:46.162 --> 45:48.289
- I just...

45:48.331 --> 45:53.336
did what I felt I was inside,

45:53.378 --> 45:57.173
the piece of artwork
that I am.

45:58.758 --> 46:02.095
I am fully realized,

46:02.137 --> 46:03.888
and everybody should do that.

46:14.315 --> 46:16.609
- I came to tell you
I forgive you.

46:17.610 --> 46:19.529
I don't want
the negative energy

46:19.571 --> 46:21.406
between us to hold me back...

46:22.407 --> 46:23.950
Or you.

46:25.285 --> 46:26.661
- Yeah, me too.

46:31.041 --> 46:32.375
- So how much longer

46:32.417 --> 46:34.377
are you gonna be in here?

46:34.419 --> 46:37.422
- Just another week,

46:37.464 --> 46:39.049
two, tops.

46:40.467 --> 46:41.593
- And then what?

46:44.012 --> 46:46.348
- I think I'm done with LA.

46:47.474 --> 46:49.184
- Not everybody
is equipped for it.

46:49.225 --> 46:53.480
- No, no, I got a call from
an old friend from New York,

46:53.521 --> 46:56.608
and he wants me
to join his band.

46:56.649 --> 46:59.444
So we're doing a whole...

46:59.486 --> 47:01.863
East Coast tour.

47:01.905 --> 47:05.367
- Oh, okay.
Well, that's...

47:06.993 --> 47:08.495
Exciting.

47:08.536 --> 47:10.497
I'm happy for you.

47:10.538 --> 47:13.500
- Yeah, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

47:13.541 --> 47:15.460
- What about you?

47:15.502 --> 47:19.422
- Well, by the time
you're out of here,

47:19.464 --> 47:23.301
my image will be
all over Los Angeles,

47:23.343 --> 47:25.637
and everyone will know my name.

47:29.849 --> 47:31.267
- Oh, yeah?

47:31.309 --> 47:32.644
- Yeah.

47:33.395 --> 47:34.688
You'll see.

47:40.860 --> 47:42.404
<i>- So that was the end of us.</i>

47:48.201 --> 47:51.705
<i>- We both kept playing music,</i>
<i>just not together.</i>

47:51.746 --> 47:53.123
<i>It's for the best.</i>

47:55.291 --> 47:59.212
<i>- I didn't really care for</i>
<i>the music she played after us.</i>

48:08.722 --> 48:11.975
Come on, Angie, come on.

48:12.017 --> 48:13.184
Turn around.

48:21.943 --> 48:25.822
<i>- Angelyne, she was never</i>
<i>really about the music.</i>

48:25.864 --> 48:28.199
<i>It was always</i>
<i>just a vehicle for her,</i>

48:28.241 --> 48:31.036
<i>a pit stop on her way</i>
<i>to bigger things.</i>

48:56.770 --> 48:59.022
- Ooh, that's better.

49:20.960 --> 49:22.212
- That's it?

49:22.253 --> 49:23.922
- That was the earliest
I was able to go back.

49:23.963 --> 49:25.924
Yeah, it's like
she didn't exist before then.

49:25.965 --> 49:28.093
- It doesn't matter.
She's not returning my calls.

49:28.134 --> 49:30.136
- And how many times
have you tried?

49:30.178 --> 49:32.097
- Just once or twice.

49:32.138 --> 49:34.766
- He called me 82 times.

49:34.808 --> 49:38.728
82, and then I figured,
why not?

49:38.770 --> 49:42.524
My fans had been begging
for a new billboard for years,

49:42.565 --> 49:44.818
and so I'd started
an Indiegogo campaign

49:44.859 --> 49:47.862
to pay for one, so...

49:47.904 --> 49:49.989
<i>I had Rick call him back.</i>

49:53.743 --> 49:55.078
- Jeff Glaser.

49:55.120 --> 49:58.415
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

49:58.456 --> 50:01.584
- Hello, this is Rick Krause,
and I work for Angelyne.

50:01.626 --> 50:03.420
<i>Please take me off</i>
<i>of speakerphone.</i>

50:03.461 --> 50:05.505
- You're not on--

50:05.547 --> 50:07.382
yeah, sure, no problem.

50:07.424 --> 50:09.050
Thank you so much for calling.

50:09.092 --> 50:10.844
It's great to finally talk to
someone on the Angelyne team.

50:10.885 --> 50:12.053
<i>When could I meet her?</i>

50:12.095 --> 50:13.638
- She'll meet you now.
- Now?

50:13.680 --> 50:16.141
- Remember that she can shut
down the interview at any time.

50:16.182 --> 50:17.392
She is in charge.

50:17.434 --> 50:21.271
Angelyne...
is always in charge.
