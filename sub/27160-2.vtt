WEBVTT

00:07.001 --> 00:09.161
An exchange would be made
in return for information.

00:09.201 --> 00:12.041
What do you have to give
that I could possibly want?

00:12.081 --> 00:13.801
Oslo have made Markus...
- He's our new governor.

00:13.841 --> 00:17.081
Are you all happy letting the town drunk
just wander around shooting a hunting rifle?

00:17.121 --> 00:19.641
He is not the town drunk!

00:19.681 --> 00:21.801
Hey, man. I got you, huh?
Whoa!

00:21.841 --> 00:23.361
You're in good hands.

00:23.401 --> 00:25.561
My husband has done this before.

00:25.601 --> 00:26.841
Do you want me, Boyd?

00:27.721 --> 00:30.001
The parasites, the wasps, the larvae,
they're dead and gone.

00:30.041 --> 00:33.241
A single specimen was preserved
in cryogenic suspension.

00:33.281 --> 00:35.081
I can't believe this.

00:35.121 --> 00:37.121
They didn't get on a plane,
they're still here.

00:37.161 --> 00:39.441
Lars?
- Morning, Mr Ulvinaune.

00:44.321 --> 00:47.841
<i>♪ The river did come to me ♪</i>

00:48.481 --> 00:51.561
<i>♪ Straight into my arms ♪</i>

00:53.281 --> 00:56.281
<i>♪ I tried to caress it ♪</i>

00:57.561 --> 01:01.521
<i>♪ But it ran through my fingers ♪</i>

01:03.881 --> 01:06.001

01:06.041 --> 01:07.761

01:08.401 --> 01:10.681

01:10.721 --> 01:12.281

01:13.041 --> 01:15.081

01:15.121 --> 01:17.081

01:17.601 --> 01:19.641

01:19.681 --> 01:22.521
<i>♪ Rivers will turn ♪</i>

01:57.761 --> 01:59.761
There.

02:02.001 --> 02:05.721
Out there. See 50 metres
below the escarpment?

02:07.001 --> 02:10.921
Yeah. Yeah, it's a rotor blade.
- From a helicopter.

02:10.961 --> 02:12.761
Uh-huh.
- That's it.

02:13.921 --> 02:15.681
Every last thing you need, baby.

02:23.641 --> 02:25.121
Ugh.

02:25.161 --> 02:28.241
Look, the reason Khatri's body
isn't in the wreckage

02:28.281 --> 02:30.921
is because Spindoe
did what I told her to do.

02:30.961 --> 02:34.201
Which was to throw her body
a thousand feet over the glacier.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.921
Oh, yeah, so where's the files, huh?

02:36.961 --> 02:39.681
Somebody's been here recently,
been into the wreckage.

02:39.721 --> 02:43.961
Now whoever it was took all the files,
took all the hard drives.

02:44.001 --> 02:46.001
All of Khatri's research.
- Who?

02:46.041 --> 02:48.681
Baby, I don't know who.

02:48.721 --> 02:51.041
Well, we lost it, Boyd.

02:51.081 --> 02:54.361
We lost it. All her work - everything.
We lost it.

02:54.401 --> 02:56.761
Look, they had their orders.

02:56.801 --> 02:59.201
Get rid of Khatri
and bring the files to you.

02:59.241 --> 03:00.921
They had their orders, Elsa.

03:00.961 --> 03:05.161
Khatri was in the chopper
when they left Fortitude. That I know and...

03:20.001 --> 03:21.241
What's that?

03:21.281 --> 03:23.561
Detective Sergeant Oby
left his laptop in the office.

03:23.601 --> 03:25.241
What are you reading?

03:25.281 --> 03:28.401
His report into the death of Governor
Munk. It's not finished, obviously.

03:29.721 --> 03:31.921
Obviously.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.521
Cos they still need to speak to Lars.

03:34.561 --> 03:36.561
But Lars has left town.

03:51.201 --> 03:53.601
When you found me in the car crash...

03:55.081 --> 03:58.601
When I woke up,
and I was hanging out of the wreckage

03:58.641 --> 04:02.001
and you were holding my head,
up on the hill...

04:02.801 --> 04:04.801
What?

04:05.961 --> 04:08.481
I thought you were gonna kill me, Dan.

04:10.121 --> 04:12.361
I wondered that myself.

04:12.401 --> 04:14.681
But instead you set me free.

05:36.201 --> 05:38.761
Hey.
- Hey.

05:38.801 --> 05:41.001
I got you this.
- Ah.

05:42.161 --> 05:43.761
You look terrible. What's the matter?

05:45.521 --> 05:47.441
The matter?

05:47.481 --> 05:49.161
Yeah, why does everybody look like

05:49.201 --> 05:52.201
they want to kill themselves
all the time just now?

05:53.001 --> 05:55.001
Natalie actually does.

05:56.001 --> 05:58.521
Does what?

05:58.561 --> 06:00.641
Want to kill herself.

06:00.681 --> 06:04.081
Ever since her eyes went, she...
doesn't think she can continue.

06:05.001 --> 06:08.041
Poor, poor Natalie. I should...

06:08.081 --> 06:10.041
go and visit her.

06:10.081 --> 06:12.641
You can't.
- Why not?

06:14.721 --> 06:17.641
Because she's gone.
- Gone?

06:17.681 --> 06:21.001
Yeah, her dad came and bundled her up
and took her away.

06:22.481 --> 06:26.481
That is the last
we'll ever see of Natalie Yelburton.

06:27.601 --> 06:31.201
You must be very sad.
- Not as sad as you might expect.

06:32.481 --> 06:34.441
Bit of a relief, actually, in some ways.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.481
Really?

06:43.761 --> 06:45.761
We should get another in.

06:50.681 --> 06:53.521
I was in New York
when Bill recorded this.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.001
We shared a dealer.

07:24.841 --> 07:26.841
I know.

07:28.521 --> 07:32.481
Cutaneous lesions
look like Kaposi sarcoma.

07:35.321 --> 07:37.321
Macular, I think.

07:40.161 --> 07:42.161
There's a word.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.881
Means stain.

07:49.881 --> 07:53.961
Immaculate conception
meant without stain.

07:55.521 --> 07:58.801
Something in Larry turns out
to be incompatible.

08:04.881 --> 08:06.881
I saw a donor.

08:07.801 --> 08:11.401
I think nobody will be surprised
he didn't show up one day.

08:42.601 --> 08:44.201
Somebody stinks of drink.

08:45.921 --> 08:48.281
You talking to me or the wasp?
- Is the wasp drunk?

08:48.641 --> 08:52.001
The wasp is parasitic, not paralytic.

08:53.481 --> 08:55.481
I may have had a drink.

08:56.601 --> 08:59.321
Do you think anyone
could do this madness sober?

09:01.281 --> 09:03.201
Let's do it.

09:03.241 --> 09:04.601
Do it.

09:08.561 --> 09:10.001
Left eye first?
- Both eyes.

09:10.041 --> 09:13.041
Yes, please, left eye first.

09:25.961 --> 09:28.481
Can you feel that?
- What?

09:30.001 --> 09:32.001
Nothing.

09:34.721 --> 09:36.041
Other eye.

09:39.241 --> 09:41.201
Vince?

09:41.241 --> 09:42.841
Vince?

09:42.881 --> 09:44.241
What?

09:44.281 --> 09:47.121
Fuck! Fucker tried to sting me.
- And?

09:51.401 --> 09:52.961
Erm...

09:53.001 --> 09:56.681
I'm sorry, I've had a slight...
slight technical setback here.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.521
You were...boozing
and now you've fucked this up!

10:01.561 --> 10:04.241
You just let a paralytic wasp
fuck your sightless eyeball

10:04.281 --> 10:08.001
so I'd climb down off
your moral high horse if I was you.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.041
Parasitic.

10:27.881 --> 10:29.881
Petra?

10:30.761 --> 10:32.321
Can you reach my heart?

10:33.401 --> 10:37.161
What?
- You know... Touch the heart.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.681
It's too dangerous.

10:40.721 --> 10:43.001
Here.

10:44.161 --> 10:45.801
The shaman's way.

10:48.601 --> 10:50.881
Round the side. Do it.

10:54.681 --> 10:57.201
No.
- Push it in.

10:58.721 --> 11:01.481
Three inches. And no further.

11:01.521 --> 11:04.361
No. It might kill you.

11:05.921 --> 11:08.881
Let's find out.
- Find out what?

11:09.841 --> 11:11.841
If you can.

11:21.641 --> 11:23.321
Do it, Petra.

11:26.801 --> 11:29.481
You're the only one who can do this.

11:29.521 --> 11:31.641
I can't. I can't do this.

11:33.001 --> 11:35.001
That's it. Now.

11:35.761 --> 11:37.361
Fuck me harder.

11:42.681 --> 11:45.921
Harder.

11:49.961 --> 11:52.241
Now. Go on!

12:05.761 --> 12:07.761
Well done.

12:34.881 --> 12:38.041
He sighs
- What the fuck are you?

12:57.281 --> 12:59.841
You're not in pain?
- No.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.681
You don't feel pain?

13:04.281 --> 13:07.801
Briefly. Like...a white light.

13:08.561 --> 13:11.161
Where do you go
when you lose consciousness?

13:12.321 --> 13:14.361
What makes you think I go anywhere?

13:14.401 --> 13:17.561
Because...you are talking to someone.

13:19.201 --> 13:22.121
What about? Tell me.

13:22.161 --> 13:25.441
You ask questions.
And someone is answering.

13:25.481 --> 13:28.001
Because you become angry.
- Who?

13:29.321 --> 13:32.081
Who is answering?
- He has no name.

13:37.281 --> 13:40.081
Hey.

13:40.121 --> 13:42.241
Trude.

13:42.281 --> 13:43.961
Come on.

13:44.721 --> 13:46.681
Not open yet, Michael.

13:46.721 --> 13:50.041
Don't fuck around, Trude.
It's 12 o'clock.

13:50.081 --> 13:52.841
You open at 12 o'clock.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.481
That clock's fast.

14:04.881 --> 14:07.801
Hello.
- What can I get for you?

14:09.521 --> 14:11.761
Oh, I would like...

14:14.001 --> 14:16.961
...a bottle of vodka.
- OK.

14:19.001 --> 14:21.241
And two shot glasses.

14:22.601 --> 14:24.921
Who is he?
- That guy?

14:24.961 --> 14:27.681
Mm-hm.
- His name is Michael Lennox.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.361
Thank you.

14:36.961 --> 14:38.561
Michael?

14:38.601 --> 14:40.681
Excuse me?
- She said you were Michael.

14:40.721 --> 14:42.641
Yes. Er...

14:42.681 --> 14:44.681
Michael Lennox. That's my name.

14:46.241 --> 14:49.921
I have some questions.
- Questions?

14:49.961 --> 14:52.681
You look so nervous, Michael.
Don't be nervous.

14:54.641 --> 14:57.001
Thank you.

14:57.601 --> 14:59.081
Here you go.

14:59.121 --> 15:00.161
May I?

15:02.561 --> 15:05.641
Do you mind if I ask...
who the hell are you?

15:05.681 --> 15:08.201
Hm.
- And er... What the hell...

15:09.001 --> 15:12.441
...questions er...
do you wanna ask of me?

15:17.921 --> 15:20.521
My name is Elsa.

15:20.561 --> 15:23.081
And I wanna know
what it's like to live in this place.

15:24.041 --> 15:26.521
Excuse me?
- For the last very many years

15:26.561 --> 15:28.921
I lived in Los Angeles.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.441
Every day the sun shines
like the day before

15:31.481 --> 15:33.601
and the day before that, and...

15:33.641 --> 15:35.601
Well, the next day would be the same.

15:35.641 --> 15:39.201
We're all animals
and our bodies adapt and change

15:39.241 --> 15:41.241
if we alter our environment.

15:42.601 --> 15:45.721
I wanna know what it feels like
to live in a place

15:45.761 --> 15:50.001
where my blood
and the air around my skin are at war.

15:50.921 --> 15:53.481
Well, er...

15:54.281 --> 15:55.961
Er...

15:56.001 --> 15:58.961
Thermals and a good fleece are...

15:59.001 --> 16:00.801
...de rigueur...

16:00.841 --> 16:04.641
in erm...Fortitude to prevent the er...

16:04.681 --> 16:07.521
skin wars from er... starting.

16:07.561 --> 16:09.361
Hm.

16:10.641 --> 16:12.001
Well...

16:12.041 --> 16:15.281
I want a man who knows this place well.

16:16.001 --> 16:18.241
Who knows how to survive here.

16:18.881 --> 16:22.881
Who can show me around
and take me to sea.

16:25.041 --> 16:28.841
Take me inland to the ice fields
and the mountains.

16:30.481 --> 16:32.881
To the ends of the earth.

16:34.601 --> 16:36.001
To the ends of the earth.

16:36.721 --> 16:38.881
You got anything better to do,
Michael Lennox?

16:40.921 --> 16:43.121
This was next to the till.
Ralfi left it.

16:43.161 --> 16:44.321
Ralfi?

16:44.361 --> 16:47.401
"Don't serve Michael Lennox any drinks.
He's barred for fighting."

16:47.441 --> 16:50.361
Ah...Ralfi, he's just kidding around.

16:50.401 --> 16:52.761
Michael...
- Hey.

16:52.801 --> 16:55.441
You're not serving him with drink.
You served me with drink.

16:55.481 --> 16:57.761
And now I'm serving him.

16:57.801 --> 17:00.201
Please, Trude

17:00.241 --> 17:02.561
Michael and I are long lost friends.

17:02.601 --> 17:04.761
Why did you ask me his name, then?

17:06.801 --> 17:09.521
It's been such a long time,
I wasn't sure it was him.

17:11.121 --> 17:12.921
We were lovers...

17:12.961 --> 17:15.721
before he left America and came here.

17:15.761 --> 17:17.881
I've been searching all my life.

17:17.921 --> 17:20.441
You - you and Michael.

17:20.481 --> 17:24.761
Well, that was...
way, way, way before I married Freya.

17:24.801 --> 17:27.641
Does Ingrid know?
- Nobody knows.

17:29.961 --> 17:33.641
Well... maybe you can save him, then.

17:37.481 --> 17:40.081
Mm... Small towns.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.801
Fuck all that.

17:43.161 --> 17:45.401
To the ghost of our memories.

17:48.681 --> 17:50.681
The ghost.

17:59.641 --> 18:03.081
Always the same with DIY.
Need a Phillips, only got a...

18:03.121 --> 18:05.281
I'm gonna be back later with the correct

18:05.321 --> 18:07.481
and appropriate implement.

18:09.961 --> 18:11.841
You warm enough?

18:11.881 --> 18:13.201
Bloody cold in here.

18:13.241 --> 18:17.361
Course, we're underground in the Arctic,
traditionally a very cold environment.

18:17.401 --> 18:21.441
Permafrost. Freeze the bollocks off
a woolly mammoth.

18:24.281 --> 18:26.281
Nat?

18:28.641 --> 18:30.641
Can you hear me, Natalie?

18:33.441 --> 18:36.601
I'm preparing myself
for the moment when your personality

18:36.641 --> 18:40.281
is subsumed to the greater
imperative of the parasitical larva

18:40.321 --> 18:44.561
and your humanity becomes reduced
to a vestigial remnant.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.841
Are we there yet?

18:46.881 --> 18:49.081
Duh!

18:49.121 --> 18:50.801
Duh?
- No.

18:50.841 --> 18:52.641
We're not fucking there yet.

18:52.681 --> 18:54.721
Good.
- Whimpers

18:54.761 --> 18:56.761
I'm freezing, Vincent.

18:58.921 --> 19:00.321
I'm cold.

19:00.361 --> 19:02.321
And I'm s-shivering.

19:02.361 --> 19:04.481
I feel sick.

19:04.521 --> 19:07.841
This... This was a fucking rubbish idea.

19:07.881 --> 19:10.081
Is that better?

19:10.521 --> 19:12.881
Could I have a cuddle, please?

19:23.161 --> 19:25.601
He's gone and the taxi's gone with him.

19:25.641 --> 19:29.721
And now the party's just me
and this gorgeous girl named Freya

19:29.761 --> 19:32.801
who didn't wanna share a taxi
with Big John.

19:32.841 --> 19:36.601
So...I tell you, I'm kind of shaking.

19:36.641 --> 19:38.921
And we're just sitting. And er...

19:38.961 --> 19:40.401
So, I say, erm...

19:40.441 --> 19:43.841
"So, erm...where are you
sleeping tonight?"

19:44.521 --> 19:46.521
And er... there's silence.

19:47.601 --> 19:50.561
And then she looks right at me
and says,

19:50.601 --> 19:52.761
"In your bed."

19:52.801 --> 19:56.121
And I swear to God...
I'm thinking...

19:56.161 --> 19:59.801
"Jesus, does this mean
I'm gonna have to sleep in the bathtub?"

19:59.841 --> 20:03.801
Ah, men are ridiculous
when a woman says what she wants.

20:03.841 --> 20:05.841
That's what I'm saying.

20:05.881 --> 20:09.041
Cos I couldn't believe my ears.
I mean, I couldn't believe my luck.

20:09.081 --> 20:10.481
Here you go.

20:17.601 --> 20:20.841
Will you er... excuse me?

20:21.601 --> 20:23.601
Of course.
- Hm.

20:38.441 --> 20:40.241
Mm...

21:12.401 --> 21:14.401
What are you thinking?

21:16.281 --> 21:18.481
I'm thinking...

21:18.801 --> 21:22.041
Sergeant Oby kind of worships
his boss, don't you think?

21:22.081 --> 21:25.521
To an unhealthy degree.
I mean, I never worshipped my boss.

21:25.561 --> 21:28.001
You never worshipped Dan Anderssen?

21:28.041 --> 21:31.481
Not even slightly.
Especially not these days.

21:31.521 --> 21:32.801
Why not?

21:34.081 --> 21:35.761
Eric.

21:35.801 --> 21:38.521
Come on. Dan has had some kind of
terrible mental breakdown.

21:38.561 --> 21:40.561
We're all pretending
everything is normal.

21:40.601 --> 21:43.241
Eric, you know this as well as I do.
Does Petra think the same?

21:43.281 --> 21:45.361
Petra is fucking him.
- She is?

21:45.401 --> 21:48.841
Of course she is.
Are you completely oblivious

21:48.881 --> 21:51.401
to everything that's going on
around you?

21:51.441 --> 21:54.121
Dan's gone crazy. Petra's lost her mind.

21:54.161 --> 21:56.961
My dad is drinking himself to death.
- No, I knew that.

21:57.001 --> 21:58.921
You're in a bubble of grief and denial.

21:58.961 --> 22:02.361
I'm not in a bubble.
- What if our friends and neighbours

22:02.401 --> 22:05.001
did murder Governor fuck-arse Munk?
- I'm not in a bubble...

22:05.041 --> 22:08.121
Sheriff Anderssen?
Sheriff? Eric! Eric!

22:08.161 --> 22:11.361
There's been a shooting at Lars' cabin.
A man and a woman.

22:11.401 --> 22:13.001
Who?
- And Lars, Lars is dead.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.801
I'll call Dan now.

22:14.841 --> 22:17.721
Ingrid, get Jock. Find Petra now!

22:17.761 --> 22:19.521
Meet me outside.

23:08.201 --> 23:10.561
<i>Dan? Dan?</i>

23:10.601 --> 23:13.601
<i>We're responding to a report
of a multiple homicide.</i>

23:13.641 --> 23:15.241
<i>Three dead, maybe more.</i>

23:15.281 --> 23:18.601
<i>Ingrid and me are heading out
to Lars Ulvinaune's cabin now.</i>

23:18.641 --> 23:21.041
<i>Get there as fast as you can. Over.</i>

23:27.161 --> 23:30.601
Don't respond. Let Eric deal with it.

23:30.641 --> 23:33.641
This is all his fault. You know that.

23:33.681 --> 23:35.961
Let him and Ingrid work the scene.

23:39.081 --> 23:41.081
Stand up.

23:43.001 --> 23:45.001
Stand up!

23:49.121 --> 23:52.601
You lost a lot of blood.
What have you been doing?

23:52.641 --> 23:55.961
I asked Petra to stick
the shaman's knife into me.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.361
Huh.

24:00.041 --> 24:01.601
I won't have it.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.921
You're the sheriff

24:03.961 --> 24:08.681
not a ritualistic goddamn
sadomasochistic nutjob.

24:08.721 --> 24:10.721
I know. I know.

24:13.601 --> 24:16.321
You should eat before you fall down.

24:16.361 --> 24:19.081
Give Eric an hour
and then get out there.

24:28.561 --> 24:30.601
Lars is dead inside the doorway.

24:30.641 --> 24:32.641
The killer could be inside.

24:32.681 --> 24:35.361
I know. Could be.

25:20.001 --> 25:22.001
It's clear.

25:35.841 --> 25:37.841
DCI Myklebust.

25:37.881 --> 25:40.001
Shot in the centre of her forehead.

25:46.881 --> 25:49.241
She's dead!

25:49.281 --> 25:50.681
Two shots fired.

25:50.721 --> 25:52.321
Sergeant Oby.

25:52.361 --> 25:55.041
One rifle shot through the chest.

26:08.241 --> 26:10.241
There's no pulse. He's dead too.

26:24.841 --> 26:27.961
Lars shot Oby when he opened the door.

26:29.561 --> 26:32.401
Then Myklebust's first shot...

26:33.521 --> 26:35.521
..missed Lars.

26:35.801 --> 26:39.521
The second shot
nearly took his head off.

26:41.041 --> 26:45.401
Yeah, and Lars shot DCI Myklebust
straight between the eyes.

26:45.441 --> 26:48.281
Bang! Bang! They both shot
in the same split-second.

26:48.321 --> 26:50.361
If it was "Bang! Bang!"
only one of them would be dead

26:50.401 --> 26:51.841
because the second "Bang" would have missed.

26:51.881 --> 26:54.041
So it must have just been "Bang!"

26:54.081 --> 26:56.121
We set up a perimeter.

26:57.001 --> 26:59.041
Fingertip snow search.

26:59.081 --> 27:01.961
Anything doesn't look right
in the scenario

27:02.001 --> 27:06.201
we put up a numbered plastic cup
over the fucker.

27:06.241 --> 27:07.841
Where the hell is Dan Anderssen?

27:21.681 --> 27:22.921
Completely raw?

27:25.081 --> 27:28.281
Are you on some kind of
faddish new diet, Dan?

27:28.321 --> 27:30.241
Ralfi, just give me the fucking meat.

27:32.841 --> 27:34.921
Enjoy.

27:57.121 --> 27:59.121
What?
- You're the sheriff.

28:00.321 --> 28:02.961
Dan Anderssen, the sheriff of Fortitude.

28:03.001 --> 28:05.041
That's what it says on my big furry hat.

28:05.081 --> 28:07.081
I'm Elsa Schenthal.

28:15.841 --> 28:19.161
Schenthal Pharmaceuticals
funded Dr Khatri.

28:19.201 --> 28:21.721
Bankrolled Erling Munk.

28:22.361 --> 28:25.641
Sent a bunch of killers and hitmen
out here to kidnap me.

28:25.681 --> 28:27.841
We're past all that now.

28:27.881 --> 28:29.601
We are?
- Yes.

28:30.401 --> 28:33.761
After the experiments
a lab rat doesn't have any value.

28:33.801 --> 28:35.881
A lab rat?
- I was one too.

28:37.081 --> 28:38.841
You were a lab rat?

28:38.881 --> 28:41.961
The circumstances
that created you and me...

28:42.001 --> 28:44.281
I've been researching this all my life.

28:44.321 --> 28:46.281
..created 19 others like us.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.361
The parasite.

28:49.401 --> 28:51.001
eighteen of you and one of me.

28:52.641 --> 28:54.161
One of you?

28:54.201 --> 28:56.681
Well, the rest never made it
beyond a couple of years, so...

28:56.721 --> 28:59.241
Hm. So er...

28:59.281 --> 29:01.481
How long did you make it?

29:01.521 --> 29:03.001
Since infection.
- Huh?

29:03.041 --> 29:06.961
Well, that was er... 73 years ago.

29:11.041 --> 29:14.041
I owe you recompense.
- Hm.

29:14.841 --> 29:19.441
This... is not what you need.

29:19.481 --> 29:21.561
Hm. Well...

29:21.601 --> 29:23.601
So, what do I need?

29:24.361 --> 29:26.201
Cerebrospinal fluid.

29:27.801 --> 29:29.801
Human?
- Yes, of course.

29:30.801 --> 29:33.001
It contains neuroendocrine factors

29:33.041 --> 29:35.321
which seem to enable renewal.

29:36.281 --> 29:38.281
Hm.

29:38.801 --> 29:41.561
So, let me be clear about this.

29:41.601 --> 29:44.281
Cos, er... I can't imagine
there's a queue of donors.

29:44.321 --> 29:45.481
Hm.

29:45.521 --> 29:47.601
I'm assuming you have to...

29:48.281 --> 29:52.761
harvest this cerebrospinal fluid
from living human beings.

29:52.801 --> 29:54.081
That's correct.

29:54.121 --> 29:56.321
That become dead human beings?

29:56.361 --> 29:59.041
They have to be alive
during the extraction.

29:59.081 --> 30:03.401
But, yes... nobody's going home
at the end of the day.

30:03.441 --> 30:06.001
Apart from you, Elsa.
- Dan...

30:06.041 --> 30:09.641
You will be obsessively drawn
to near-death experience

30:09.681 --> 30:12.801
and a desire to connect
with all the people you kill.

30:12.841 --> 30:17.561
Alongside this will be...
terrible numbing of empathy.

30:17.601 --> 30:22.041
Complete confusion regarding
your moral purpose, any purpose.

30:23.041 --> 30:26.281
You will encounter
a menagerie of plagues, boils

30:26.321 --> 30:28.521
decrepitudes and infirmities.

30:28.561 --> 30:31.641
You will become mad,
you will become lost.

30:31.681 --> 30:34.721
Then if you survive that,
you will become death.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.361
I am not a parasite.

30:40.961 --> 30:42.961
Hm.

30:45.881 --> 30:49.401
When you become desperate,
come and find me.

31:04.801 --> 31:07.041
Haemorrhaging all across the sclera.

31:07.081 --> 31:09.121
From the gunshot?
- Maybe...

31:09.161 --> 31:11.921
Though I would associate this
with strangulation.

31:11.961 --> 31:13.641
Gunshot to the throat like this

31:14.001 --> 31:16.561
would instantly reduce
blood pressure to the head.

31:16.601 --> 31:18.201
And no haemorrhaging would result.

31:33.161 --> 31:35.641
What are you doing?
- What?

31:35.681 --> 31:37.521
This is a fucking crime scene!

31:37.561 --> 31:40.081
What?
- You're contaminating a murder scene.

31:40.121 --> 31:41.681
I'm contaminating...
- Yes!

31:41.721 --> 31:43.841
What the hell is this clown
playing at here?

31:43.881 --> 31:46.401
I am the interim governor.

31:46.441 --> 31:50.801
And the Governor of Fortitude
is also the Chief of Fortitude Police.

31:56.801 --> 31:58.681
You fucking...

32:12.401 --> 32:14.201
You can sure hold a liquor.

32:15.761 --> 32:18.361
You see, my belief is that...

32:18.401 --> 32:22.321
her metabolism produces way more
than the average dehydrogenase

32:22.361 --> 32:25.601
which denatures the ethanol
in the vodka.

32:26.961 --> 32:29.201
Whatever.

32:29.241 --> 32:31.641
That's the chloroform I used
making you sick.

32:32.321 --> 32:34.881
Mixed in with all the vodka
that she fed you.

32:34.921 --> 32:37.801
It's best if you get it all out
so you don't choke.

32:38.921 --> 32:42.361
Please, would you untie me?

32:42.401 --> 32:45.441
This is not good.
I didn't do anything...

32:46.441 --> 32:48.441
...to you.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.921
Please, you got it wrong.

32:53.841 --> 32:58.441
If this is about that woman
at the bar... I don't know her.

32:59.601 --> 33:02.881
I'm just er... a guy in the bar.

33:02.921 --> 33:05.521
Nobody.

33:05.561 --> 33:07.561
Just a guy that drinks.

33:08.281 --> 33:10.761
No. No, don't... Stop.

33:11.561 --> 33:13.761
Please. No, don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

33:13.801 --> 33:16.001
No! No, no!

33:16.641 --> 33:18.641
No!

33:18.681 --> 33:20.681
You fucker!

33:29.561 --> 33:31.561
You are not to blame.

33:32.441 --> 33:34.601
You know what an enchantress is?

33:35.561 --> 33:38.721
Yeah. That's what she is.

33:43.481 --> 33:45.761
Make sure you get some rest.

35:29.881 --> 35:32.961
Jesus.

35:37.801 --> 35:38.681
Did I hurt you?

35:39.241 --> 35:41.081
Yeah. Yes.

35:41.121 --> 35:44.841
Yes, you fucking hurt me.
You broke my fucking nose.

35:46.561 --> 35:50.241
I'm so sorry. It wasn't personal.

35:50.281 --> 35:52.121
What?

35:52.161 --> 35:53.881
It's over now. I can't reach you.

35:56.641 --> 35:58.921
What is?
- The parasite.

35:58.961 --> 36:00.961
I have no control.

36:01.001 --> 36:04.081
Natalie... Natalie had no control.

36:04.121 --> 36:06.321
My fucking head.

36:06.361 --> 36:10.281
It does sound like your nose is broken,
the sound of your voice.

36:11.401 --> 36:13.601
You should go to A&E,
get it seen to.

36:13.641 --> 36:16.241
Fucking right.
- And more chain.

36:18.961 --> 36:21.961
I need to be restrained
on my wrists and ankles.

36:23.801 --> 36:25.921
I can't fight it
when it grabs me like that.

36:25.961 --> 36:29.281
There's no... negotiation, no discussion.

36:29.321 --> 36:30.921
It's just... boom!

36:30.961 --> 36:32.961
More restraints.

36:34.281 --> 36:36.281
Oh...
- Er...

36:37.801 --> 36:40.521
I bought you a heater, if you get cold.

36:43.801 --> 36:45.881
Thanks, Vince.

36:45.921 --> 36:48.561
You're really kind and thoughtful
and I appreciate it.

37:59.201 --> 38:01.201
Fuck you!

38:01.241 --> 38:03.401
Aaaargh! Aaargh!

38:11.121 --> 38:13.921
It's all good. It's all good.

38:13.961 --> 38:15.961
It's all good.

38:31.161 --> 38:34.161
As soon as I've... I've got her home

38:34.201 --> 38:36.241
we'll get this over and done with, huh?

38:39.881 --> 38:40.721
Hey.

42:02.801 --> 42:04.601
Aargh!

42:08.201 --> 42:09.521
Urgh!

42:42.961 --> 42:44.961
Aaargh!

45:09.321 --> 45:12.041
Untie me.
- I'm not going to untie you.

45:12.081 --> 45:14.281
This isn't healthy.
- You're bloody telling me it isn't.

45:14.321 --> 45:18.121
How the fuck do you explain having
a woman bondaged up in your basement?

45:18.161 --> 45:19.881
Boyd!

45:20.321 --> 45:22.241
Elsa.

45:22.281 --> 45:27.281
I want a SIG Sauer P226
X5 tactical

45:27.321 --> 45:29.801
with a custom Hogue grip
and tritium sights.

45:30.521 --> 45:31.721
Put down the gun.
