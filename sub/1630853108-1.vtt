WEBVTT

00:41.709 --> 00:43.177
Stop.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.945
- I'll stop if you just
explain it to me,

00:45.079 --> 00:46.514
-because I don't...
-Would you please just drop it?

00:46.647 --> 00:47.981
- All right, all right,
fine, fine, fine, fine.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.117
Consider it dropped.
It's dropped.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.252
-It's on the ground.
-Good.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.122
But, I mean, come on,
everybody loves birthdays.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.989
-You got decorations.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.991
You got balloons.
You got parties and cake.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.627
Look, I don't need presents,

00:59.760 --> 01:02.763
I don't want decorations,
and I'm-I'm not a cake guy.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.732
Seriously, though,
you don't like cake?

01:04.865 --> 01:06.734
Name one food better than cake.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.001
Guinea pig.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.870
Oh, again with the guinea pig.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.939
I bet if I blindfolded you,

01:12.072 --> 01:13.774
you wouldn't be able
to tell the difference

01:13.907 --> 01:15.743
between a skunk
and a guinea pig.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.546
Wrong. Snakes have
impeccable taste buds.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.681
-I can taste air.
-Air?

01:20.814 --> 01:22.316
Yes. Air.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.286
Mm. Nice.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.588
I don't know.
They're a little, uh...

01:27.721 --> 01:29.257
a little cute for my taste.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.592
That's what makes them
so delicious.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.494
You're not just eating food.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.363
You're eating pure goodness.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.930
It's not about the pig.

01:37.064 --> 01:40.434
It's about what it symbolizes
on a deeper level.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.137
So, you can...
you can taste air?

01:43.271 --> 01:44.538
-What else you got?

01:44.672 --> 01:45.839
-Forget about it.
-W-W-Wait.

01:45.973 --> 01:47.541
-Can you also hear color?

01:47.675 --> 01:49.543
-Can you see sound?
-All right, all right. Okay.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.745
'Cause we should really be
capitalizing on these skills.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.614
Okay, all right, fine.
Get it all out.

01:53.747 --> 01:54.948
-Get it all out now.
-Okay, okay.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.252
Look at that.- 00 p.m.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.621
Now I know the exact moment
our friendship died.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.458
-Let's bounce.
-Yep.

02:05.693 --> 02:09.029
Tastes like, um, you're gonna
stick me with the bill-- again.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.931
-Well, it is my birthday.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.733
So now you play
the birthday card?

02:12.866 --> 02:14.568
-That's interesting.

02:14.702 --> 02:18.005
Can we get a check, please,
when you get a chance?

02:18.138 --> 02:21.041
Hello? Checkity-check-check.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.676
-You know what?

02:22.810 --> 02:26.113
We're just gonna leave
the money right here, okay?

02:26.247 --> 02:27.981
You know the one good thing
about this place?

02:28.115 --> 02:29.883
-What? -We never have to wait
for a table.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.319
Well, isn't that every place?

02:31.452 --> 02:33.020
Hey, man. How you been?
I haven't seen you in...

02:33.153 --> 02:35.155
-Snake attack!

02:35.289 --> 02:36.857
Oh. Mints.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.726
Sorry, folks.
I'm switching him to decaf.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.462
All right.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.231
-- Let's do this.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.611
Guinea pig, huh?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.613
It's the Rolls-Royce of rodents.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.382
Yeah, but it's still a rodent.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.351
You know what I mean?

03:03.484 --> 03:05.519
-Don't mind us, just robbing
this place. -

03:19.467 --> 03:20.668
Whoo! Yeah!

03:20.801 --> 03:22.503
-Go bad...
-Or go home.

03:28.141 --> 03:31.011
Hey, you. Get over here.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.614
Little bit closer.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.049
Oh, I know what it is.

03:36.183 --> 03:39.853
You're afraid because
I'm the... the Big Bad Wolf.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.655
Well, I'm not surprised.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.557
I am the villain in every story.

03:43.691 --> 03:44.792
Isn't that right, Mr. Snake?

03:44.925 --> 03:46.193
Yep.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.297
Say hello to Mr. Snake.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.231
Serpentine,
safe-cracking machine.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.467
Imagine Houdini
but with no arms.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.603
Kind of guy who'd tell you
the glass is half empty,

03:55.736 --> 03:57.004
then steal it from you.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.506
He's also my best bud.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.974
And today's his birthday!

04:01.108 --> 04:03.176
-Not relevant.
-He's a sweetheart.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.978
-You're a sweetheart.

04:05.112 --> 04:07.180
Well, look who's here.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.950
-Took 'em long enough.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.823
Watch this.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.558
Three.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.593
Two. One.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.796
And over here is Ms. Tarantula,

04:22.930 --> 04:25.265
our in-house hacker,
our pocket search engine,

04:25.399 --> 04:26.867
our traveling tech wizard.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.702
We call her Webs.

04:34.842 --> 04:35.943
Very slick, Webs.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.311
I also took over
the police dispatch,

04:37.445 --> 04:38.912
blurred their satellite
imaging system,

04:39.046 --> 04:40.314
grounded their chopper.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.082
And one more thing.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.250
You didn't.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.952
I got a special delivery for...

04:45.085 --> 04:46.253
Ah! Ooh! Don't eat me!

04:46.387 --> 04:48.356
Please! Don't eat me!

04:48.489 --> 04:51.024
Happy birthday,
Mr. Grumpy Pants.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.860
I think I hate you.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.041
Guys, it's me.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.810
I was the construction worker.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.879
And this is Mr. Shark,

05:12.012 --> 05:13.514
master of disguise,

05:13.647 --> 05:16.550
apex predator
of a thousand faces.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.319
His greatest trick:
stealing the Mona Lisa

05:19.453 --> 05:22.289
-disguised as the Mona Lisa.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.491
Dig that.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.925
Watch it, big tuna.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.159
I'm trying to work here.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.761
Keep it cool, baby.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.563
Birthdays should be chill.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.466
And rounding out the crew...

05:34.702 --> 05:35.869
Surprise!

05:37.304 --> 05:38.806
...is Mr. Piranha.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.075
He's a loose cannon
with a short fuse,

05:42.209 --> 05:44.111
willing to scrap
with anyone or anything.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.913
-He's brave.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.248
-He's fearless.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.317
Uh, who am I kidding?
He's crazy.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.153
Santo cielo,
that's a lot of po-po.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.857
Uh, Piranha,
did we forget something?

05:56.990 --> 05:58.659
-What?
-The present.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.428
-You know.
-Oh, um...

06:00.561 --> 06:02.730
Of-of course I didn't forget.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.198
--You know you fart
when you lie, right?

06:05.332 --> 06:06.967
What? No, I fart
when I'm nervous.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.402
Yeah. Nervous about lying.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.203
-I'm sorry.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.872
-- Piranha!

06:12.005 --> 06:13.373
Don't breathe it in.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.742
-I breathed it in!

06:14.875 --> 06:16.477
Yeah, they're a bit eccentric,

06:16.610 --> 06:18.311
but when you're born us,
you don't exactly win

06:18.446 --> 06:20.080
many popularity contests.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.516
-Shark!
-- Shark!

06:22.650 --> 06:25.118
Do I wish people
didn't see us as monsters?

06:25.252 --> 06:26.620
Eight legs,
eight times the cardio.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.755
Monster!

06:27.888 --> 06:29.557
-- Sure, I do.
-What's up, papa?

06:29.690 --> 06:30.824
- But these are
the cards we've been dealt,

06:30.958 --> 06:32.392
so we might as well play 'em.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.794
Jackpot!

06:33.927 --> 06:35.295
Yes!

06:45.839 --> 06:47.107
Um...

06:47.240 --> 06:48.809
-What the thorax?
-Are you crazy?

06:48.942 --> 06:51.579
What? I just wanted
a longer car chase.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.246
It's the best part.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.485
Chief! It's...

06:57.618 --> 06:59.086
Them.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.022
Webs, hit it.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.694
Get them!

07:40.494 --> 07:42.295
I'm gonna put you guys away
for so long,

07:42.429 --> 07:44.865
your fleas will have fleas.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.204
Chief. You want some cake?

07:51.338 --> 07:53.774
-You seem a little hangry.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.375
Get that thing
out of my face before I...

07:55.509 --> 07:58.145
-Excuse me, Chief.
-What?

08:12.392 --> 08:13.761
You're mine.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.734
Hermano.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.264
Yeah, we may be bad,

08:51.398 --> 08:53.066
but we're so good at it.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.375
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

09:02.509 --> 09:04.544
Keep running, Wolf!

09:04.678 --> 09:07.748
One of these days,
your luck is gonna run out!

09:36.777 --> 09:39.713
All right, Piranha, you're up.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.255
-Seriously?
-- Snake, come on.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.090
-At least make a toast.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.558
-Toast! Come on!
-Come on.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.060
-- Okay, okay. All right.
A toast. -Whoo!

09:53.193 --> 09:54.662
Fine.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.865
I've made a lot of enemies
in my time-- I mean, a lot--

09:57.998 --> 10:01.001
but out of all the people
in the world,

10:01.134 --> 10:02.636
I hate you guys the least.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.304
-Aw. -That was actually
kind of beautiful.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.839
You're a poet, man.

10:05.973 --> 10:09.743
To Mr. Snake and his strange
dislike of birthdays.

10:09.877 --> 10:12.245
-- Yay!

10:12.379 --> 10:14.848
Everyone say, "Robbery."

10:14.982 --> 10:16.383
Robbery.

10:16.516 --> 10:17.818
Oh.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.787
Look at those dimples.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.655
-Happy birthday, buddy.
-Okay.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.590
-Now, dig in, fellas.
-Yes!

10:23.724 --> 10:25.659
-Piranha!

10:25.793 --> 10:27.160
-- Don't do that.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.428
That was so gross.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.030
That was my lunch!

10:30.163 --> 10:32.032
-- You snooze, you lose.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.567
-- You like that.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.369
Nice.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.106
-Ooh, wow.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.708
I forgot we had those Push Pops.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.443
Man, my tummy is rumbling
like a kraken right now.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.278
Yeah. Want it?

10:45.412 --> 10:47.447
You know he's not
gonna give it to you.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.449
No, I believe that deep down

10:49.582 --> 10:52.886
Snake is a kind
and generous soul.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.254
Why?

10:54.387 --> 10:56.223
Here. Take it.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.758
Oh, yeah!

10:57.891 --> 10:59.059
Pop me, please.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.961
-Ah...
-Ha!

11:01.094 --> 11:02.830
Sucker.

11:02.963 --> 11:06.266
Come on, man. Now you gonna
make me get all aggressive.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.268
-Animals.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.370
Spit it out! Spit it out!

11:10.503 --> 11:11.839
Never!

11:11.972 --> 11:13.606
Let's see what they're saying
about us today.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.408
What up? It's Tiffany Fluffit,
Channel 6 Action News.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.344
The Bad Guys
have struck again...

11:17.477 --> 11:20.447
Guys, guys, stop it.
We're on TV.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.015
-Ooh, ooh!
-...proving once more that they

11:22.149 --> 11:24.584
are the most diabolical
criminals of our time.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.554
Ooh, "diabolical." That's new.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.222
Know what it sounds like?
A cologne.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.590
Diabolical.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.492
- To address
this heinous crime spree

11:32.625 --> 11:35.595
is the newly elected governor,
Diane Foxington.

11:35.729 --> 11:36.997
-Governor?
-- Okay. Yeah.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.899
-I hear you. I hear you.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.602
Listen, listen. We all know
how dastardly the Bad Guys are.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.672
-- You bet we are.
-But more than anything...

11:45.806 --> 11:48.275
I feel sorry for them.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.043
What?

11:50.177 --> 11:51.779
These so-called Bad Guys

11:51.912 --> 11:54.547
are really just
second-rate has-beens.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.583
Behind their amateurish antics

11:56.716 --> 11:58.852
and, frankly,
unoriginal capers--

11:58.986 --> 12:00.788
I mean, really, another bank?--

12:00.921 --> 12:03.223
is nothing but
a deep well of anger...

12:03.356 --> 12:04.624
I ain't angry! You're angry!

12:04.758 --> 12:06.393
-...denial...
-Not true.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.660
...and self-loathing.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.797
The only one I self-loathe
is you.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.265
And those are holes
that no amount of cash

12:12.399 --> 12:15.502
or priceless art can ever fill.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.572
What's on the Food Network?

12:19.706 --> 12:21.241
So, can we just forget about...

12:21.374 --> 12:22.843
Who-who is she to judge us?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.812
-- ...and focus on more
positive things? -

12:24.945 --> 12:26.479
And what could be more positive

12:26.613 --> 12:28.615
than the Annual
Good Samaritan Awards,

12:28.748 --> 12:31.718
where tomorrow night I will
present the Golden Dolphin

12:31.852 --> 12:35.188
to this year's goodest citizen?

12:35.322 --> 12:36.556
I can't believe I voted for her.

12:36.689 --> 12:37.958
You voted for her?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.627
- What?
She's good on climate change.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.395
Wait. What's going on?

12:42.529 --> 12:45.032
You've got that twinkle
in your eye.

12:46.867 --> 12:50.037
Guys, who's up for another job?

12:50.170 --> 12:51.438
A big one.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.675
The Golden Dolphin.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.310
-Seriously?
-Oh.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.946
I thought I was the crazy one.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.448
That job has broken
every criminal who's tried it.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.117
The Bucharest Bandits,
Lucky Jim.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.919
The Crimson Paw.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.754
Actually, the Crimson Paw
was never arrested.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.223
Yeah, but he never stole
anything again.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.959
Snake, what better way

13:12.092 --> 13:14.461
to wipe that smirk
off the governor's fuzzy face

13:14.594 --> 13:15.896
than stealing the Golden Dolphin

13:16.029 --> 13:17.898
from right under her whiskers?

13:18.031 --> 13:20.633
This is the Holy Grail
of thievery.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.836
If we pull this off,
we'll cement our legacy

13:22.970 --> 13:25.238
as the greatest criminals
of all time.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.874
Whoa, whoa, buddy.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.509
I thought we weren't supposed
to make things personal.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.544
Besides, we've got
a good thing going here.

13:31.678 --> 13:35.615
Friends, freedom,
and just look at this loot.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.717
All right, you're right.
Forget it.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.020
-The Dolphin job is off.
-Good.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.455
I guess the pig
will get his trophy after all.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.757
Yeah, I guess he would...

13:44.892 --> 13:46.493
What do you mean, "pig"?

13:46.626 --> 13:48.095
Oh, yes, did I not mention that?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.697
That's weird. I thought
I mentioned that it was, uh...

13:51.865 --> 13:53.233
The Good Samaritan is...

13:53.366 --> 13:54.534
A guinea pig?

13:56.336 --> 13:57.604
What do you say, Snakey?

13:57.737 --> 13:58.972
Better than cake.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.573
-- Right.

14:00.707 --> 14:03.376
Okay. Fine.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.078
But he better be delicious.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.280
Are we all in this together?

14:09.416 --> 14:10.984
So here's the plan.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.353
Like every year,
the ceremony will be held

14:13.486 --> 14:15.155
at the Museum of Fine Arts,

14:15.288 --> 14:17.724
where the Golden Dolphin
will be positioned

14:17.857 --> 14:20.327
just beyond
the backstage curtain.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.661
Sounds easy.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.830
Sounds easy, hermano,
but to get there,

14:23.964 --> 14:26.199
we'll need to bypass
three levels of security.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.768
So, step one:
We'll need to blend in.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.845
Professor Marmalade,

14:38.979 --> 14:41.114
this year's recipient
of the Golden Dolphin,

14:41.248 --> 14:43.650
the most annoying good creature
on the planet.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.253
Professor, in the past year,
you've stopped wars,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.788
fed the hungry
and saved countless pandas.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.523
Some have described
your goodness

14:50.657 --> 14:52.592
as second only to Mother Teresa.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.162
Oh, Tiffany,
it's not a competition.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.730
And if it were, it would
really be more of a tie.

14:57.864 --> 15:00.934
But we can all agree that
there is a flower of goodness

15:01.068 --> 15:04.004
inside all of us,
just waiting to blossom.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.940
- Once inside,
there are two armored doors.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.276
The first can only be opened by

15:09.409 --> 15:11.044
a special key card
that is carried

15:11.178 --> 15:12.946
by our dear friend,
the chief of police.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.948
The second is outfitted
with a retinal scanner

15:15.082 --> 15:17.750
and guarded by
an elite special ops unit

15:17.884 --> 15:20.387
trained to strike first
and ask questions later.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.357
Governor Foxington
is the only one

15:24.491 --> 15:26.326
who has clearance
to open the second door.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.728
So, step two:
She and I will need to get

15:28.861 --> 15:30.530
up close and personal.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.332
Enjoy your evening,
Mr. Ambassador.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.500
Thank you, ma'am.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.035
Interesting piece.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.571
Trashy, pointless
and pretentious.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.074
Hmm. They say that art reveals

15:41.208 --> 15:42.875
more about the viewer
than the artist.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.444
-Mister...

15:44.577 --> 15:46.613
Poodleton. Oliver Poodleton.

15:46.746 --> 15:47.714
Uh... okay.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.749
It's about time someone stood up

15:49.882 --> 15:52.119
to those diabolical Bad Guys.

15:52.252 --> 15:55.255
Though, I've got to say,
no one's succeeded yet.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.991
Eh. I don't think
it'll be that hard.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.127
I have a feeling it'll be
harder than you think.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.262
I'd say they're
one epic job away

16:02.395 --> 16:04.097
from cementing their legacy.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.568
Mr. Poodleton,
you're-you're funny.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.137
I am?

16:10.270 --> 16:12.539
The only legacy they're
cementing is life in prison.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.374
Did you see their last job?

16:14.507 --> 16:15.975
Ugh. Unsecured exits,

16:16.109 --> 16:18.378
crude disguises,
compulsive showboating.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.879
I mean, it was a mess.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.682
All the classic signs
of a crew in decline.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.752
Next, they're gonna
make it personal.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.388
That's when you know
they're toast.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.658
Uh, well, that's your opinion.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.327
It is, and I'm the governor.

16:35.228 --> 16:39.432
As for the sculpture,
I think it's about perspective.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.268
If you look closely enough,

16:41.401 --> 16:45.938
even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.108
How about that?

16:48.241 --> 16:52.579
I guess some things
aren't always as they appear.

16:52.712 --> 16:53.913
That reminds me.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.715
May I? I can't miss a photo op

16:55.848 --> 16:57.350
with the governor
and a pile of garbage.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.920
Oh, Mr. Poodleton,
you're too hard on yourself.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.589
-Hey...

17:05.225 --> 17:06.693
Okay, friends.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.628
It's showtime.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.432
Once we're in,
it's on to step three:

17:12.565 --> 17:15.135
We split up
and we take our positions.

17:15.268 --> 17:18.838
Officers, if the Bad Guys
crash this event,

17:18.971 --> 17:20.940
I am definitely
going to lose my job,

17:21.074 --> 17:24.277
and I will not hesitate
to take you down with me.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.146
-Now, move out.
-- Yes, ma'am!

17:26.279 --> 17:27.814
Hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut,

17:27.947 --> 17:29.649
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut...

17:44.264 --> 17:46.533
Mic's on.
Everyone on comms, do you copy?

17:46.666 --> 17:47.767
-Copy.
-Copy. -Copy.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.469
Copy.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.856
A drink for the pretty lady?

18:09.989 --> 18:12.625
No, thank you. My life is
too complicated right now.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.461
Uh, uh...

18:41.554 --> 18:43.590
Boys, it's Dolphin season.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.196
Copy that. I'm on the move.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.165
Unit two, is the backstage
area still secure?

18:52.299 --> 18:53.533
OFFICER
Unit two. All clear.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.968
This is where
all the training pays off.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.704
-Oh, pardon me.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.672
-Terribly sorry.
-Not a problem, sir.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.708
Keep your eyes open, boys.

19:01.841 --> 19:05.812
They could be anywhere,
just waiting to humiliate us.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.049
Wolf is in position.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.519
Piranha, you all
penguin-suited and booted?

19:12.652 --> 19:16.088
Affirmative. I'm a clean, mean,
Dolphin-stealing machine.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.124
What's going on, guys?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.503
-Here, let me help you.
-Ooh.

20:03.636 --> 20:04.871
Are you okay, ma'am?

20:05.004 --> 20:08.040
Oh, my gracious, yes.

20:08.174 --> 20:11.711
I may be dizzy, but I'm alive,
thanks to you.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.413
-- What are you...
-Oh.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.781
Mm.

20:16.483 --> 20:19.085
Thank you, dear.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.922
You're such a good boy.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.343
All good, brother?

20:43.476 --> 20:46.746
Yeah, all... a-all good.
Yeah, yeah.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.315
Um...

20:48.448 --> 20:50.917
Webs, what do you say about
moving on to step four?

20:51.050 --> 20:53.686
Copy that. Shark, you're up.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.988
-Do your thing.
-Do I get to improvise?

20:56.122 --> 20:58.024
Yes, fine. Improvise.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.792
But please be subtle.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.661
Mm-hmm.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.432
I'm having a baby!

21:05.565 --> 21:06.899
Is there a doctor?

21:07.033 --> 21:08.968
Or perhaps
several security guards

21:09.101 --> 21:10.903
that could leave their post
and help me?

21:31.023 --> 21:32.625
"Fish surprise"?

21:33.626 --> 21:35.495
Surprise!

21:42.669 --> 21:44.337
Hey, Webs,
can you enhance this...

21:44.471 --> 21:47.039
- Done. Eight steps
ahead of you, Wolfie.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.682
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:55.815 --> 21:58.751
your emcee for
the Good Samaritan Awards...

22:00.353 --> 22:02.188
WOLF
All right, Shark, we're in.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.391
Oops,
I forgot, I'm not pregnant.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.559
...president of the committee,

22:06.693 --> 22:08.995
Governor Diane Foxington.

22:09.128 --> 22:11.731
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.033
Thank you.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.069
Last year,
we faced our biggest test

22:17.203 --> 22:20.673
when a meteorite crashed
into our dear city.

22:20.807 --> 22:23.776
That meteorite didn't just make
a hole in our city.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.778
It made a hole in our hearts.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.714
-- Aw.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.116
But even in tragedy,
Professor Marmalade,

22:30.249 --> 22:31.951
he did what he does so well.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.454
He made us look
at things differently.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.288
And thanks to you, Marmalade,

22:36.423 --> 22:40.026
the Love Crater Meteorite
will forever serve as a symbol

22:40.159 --> 22:43.796
of how there is good
even in the worst places.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.799
Whoo!

22:56.208 --> 22:58.277
Hurry up.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.081
...and successfully reversed
climate change

23:02.214 --> 23:04.484
for the well-being of all of us.

23:04.617 --> 23:08.220
This is going
surprisingly smoothly.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.197
What the molt is that?

23:18.330 --> 23:19.732
- The Wolf Piranha
Snake Shark Tarantula

23:19.866 --> 23:21.734
-Protection System.
-- The WPSST?

23:21.868 --> 23:24.236
-This was not supposed
to happen. -What?

23:24.370 --> 23:26.272
Guys, calm down. I'm on it.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.776
Initiating WPSST override
protocol.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.077
Get it, queen!

23:32.712 --> 23:34.847
-- Did it work?
-Just give me five minutes.

23:34.981 --> 23:38.317
And now, please join me
in welcoming to the stage...

23:38.451 --> 23:40.086
We don't have five minutes.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.321
...Professor Marmalade.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.389
Aw.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.758
We love you,
Professor Marmalade!

23:45.892 --> 23:47.093
The pig is on the move.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.361
I repeat, the pig
is on the move.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.864
Webs, Webs, the curtain's
going up any minute.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.065
It's not letting me in.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.366
Check your system preferences.

23:54.501 --> 23:55.802
You probably need
to download a driver.

23:55.935 --> 23:56.903
Try rebooting.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.404
Oh, my gosh, you fixed it.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.639
-SNAKE and- Really?
-No!

23:59.772 --> 24:01.541
-- Hey, Larry.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.642
Come on, open up.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.443
What did we say
about locking doors?

24:04.577 --> 24:06.913
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Shark, I got a situation here.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.247
Copy that. I'm on my way.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.518
Hurry up, guys.

24:11.651 --> 24:14.153
Time to turn this baby
on beast mode.

24:16.322 --> 24:18.591
Eat it, WPSST!

24:22.962 --> 24:24.597
Please, not now.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.398
-Wolf. -Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, Piranha!

24:26.533 --> 24:29.268
-This award is for...

24:30.302 --> 24:32.071
As I was saying...

24:32.204 --> 24:35.575
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

24:39.779 --> 24:42.448
-Piranha! Are you kidding me?
-- Sorry!

24:42.582 --> 24:44.684
And that's why
my Gala for Goodness

24:44.817 --> 24:47.587
will raise all the money needed
for those less fortunate.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.955
-- Come on!

24:50.857 --> 24:53.292
I'm starting
to get mad here, Larry.

24:54.393 --> 24:55.828
-- Webs! Webs!

24:55.962 --> 24:59.599
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.703
-Whoa!

25:13.880 --> 25:15.114
SHARK
Excuse me.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.749
Is this the ladies' room?

25:16.883 --> 25:18.918
Oh, uh, y-you need
to take a right

25:19.051 --> 25:20.920
at the end of the hall, ma'am.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.494
Yes. Whoop-bam!

25:29.796 --> 25:30.863
Oh, come on!

25:31.664 --> 25:35.267
And now it is my honor
to award Professor Marmalade

25:35.401 --> 25:39.471
with the Golden Dolphin!

25:41.173 --> 25:42.474
-No.
-No.

25:42.609 --> 25:43.743
Yes!

25:43.876 --> 25:46.112
I mean, yes!

25:46.245 --> 25:47.914
What?

25:52.952 --> 25:55.254
Everyone, everyone, uh,
please don't panic.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.689
Just stay calm.

25:56.823 --> 25:59.125
I'm-I'm sure there's
an explanation for this.

26:00.526 --> 26:03.996
I repeat, uh,
please do not panic.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.266
Nice work, everybody.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.402
Now, let's make like a wolf
and get the pack out of here.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.404
Ah, wordplay.

26:12.538 --> 26:13.706
I don't get it.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.708
Diane, Diane, if I may...

26:15.842 --> 26:17.910
-You have to understand,

26:18.044 --> 26:21.180
I didn't bring hope back
to the city for an award.

26:21.313 --> 26:25.217
I did these good things because
of how they made me feel.

26:25.351 --> 26:26.853
That tingly feeling I get.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.287
That shiver up my spine.

26:28.420 --> 26:32.191
The wag in my tiny tail.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.160
Because, you see,

26:34.293 --> 26:38.530
being good just feels so good.

26:38.665 --> 26:42.669
And when you're good,
you're loved.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.772
-Wolf?

26:45.905 --> 26:47.306
-Wolf?
-What are you doing?

26:47.439 --> 26:49.408
SNAKE, SHARK and-
Go!

26:49.541 --> 26:51.343
-It's the Bad Guys!

26:51.477 --> 26:52.645
Arrest them!

26:52.779 --> 26:53.545
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

26:53.680 --> 26:54.914
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

26:55.047 --> 26:56.883
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.551
They stole the Golden Dolphin!

26:59.686 --> 27:02.521
Come on, you can't prove that.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.325
My baby!

27:06.458 --> 27:07.994
-On your knees, Bad Guys.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.228
With your hands up.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.397
Never! We're out of here.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.368
So long, suckers.

27:22.508 --> 27:25.211
Well, this just got
a little weird.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.015
The Bad Guys go bust.

27:29.148 --> 27:32.151
The nefarious fivesome
has finally been captured.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.921
And I, Tiffany Fluffit,
am first on the scene.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.724
Wow. You know, I-I just
realized that I have devoted

27:37.857 --> 27:40.326
my entire adult life
to putting you in jail.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.061
You are my purpose.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.963
Without you, who am I?

27:44.096 --> 27:45.397
Ah, I'm just kidding.

27:45.531 --> 27:47.199
This is the best moment
of my life!

27:48.500 --> 27:51.170
It's the end of the Bad Guys.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.604
No!

27:52.739 --> 27:54.640
Get your hands off of me!

27:54.774 --> 27:57.143
Ooh, you're begging
for a biting right now.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.677
Wolf!

28:01.981 --> 28:03.716
- Professor Marmalade!
Madam Governor!

28:03.850 --> 28:05.584
Ooh, Professor Marmalade!
Madam Governor!

28:05.718 --> 28:07.820
-Madam Governor!
-One at a time. One at a time.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.623
-Hey. Hey!
-Excuse me.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.592
-Sorry to interrupt.

28:13.726 --> 28:16.428
I just wanted to congratulate
the governor here.

28:16.562 --> 28:19.031
I got to say,
you really got us pegged.

28:19.165 --> 28:23.402
We're just a deep well
of anger and self-loathing.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.371
-Denial.
-Sure. That, too.

28:25.504 --> 28:26.572
-Narcissism.
-Yeah. Yeah.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.874
Emotional emptiness.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.408
-So we're on the same page.
-Hmm.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.510
What is he doing?

28:31.643 --> 28:34.680
Sadly, we were never
given a chance

28:34.814 --> 28:38.284
to be anything more
than second-rate criminals.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.887
If only there was someone
who could help

28:41.020 --> 28:44.556
the flower of goodness
inside us blossom.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.959
Some icon of love
and forgiveness,

28:47.093 --> 28:50.396
like, uh, I don't know,
Mother Teresa.

28:50.529 --> 28:53.465
Best thing is to just
throw us in jail

28:53.599 --> 28:56.102
for the rest
of our hopeless lives.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.904
Yeah, that's the plan.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.671
-Wait, wait, wait, no, no.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.373
-Get in there.
-Ow!

29:01.507 --> 29:03.442
Wait.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.477
Uh, beg... beg pardon?

29:05.611 --> 29:07.513
Mr. Wolf may be a savage beast.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.181
Basically walking garbage.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.649
Sorry, I'm making a point.

29:10.783 --> 29:12.384
Do what you need to do, pal.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.553
But how can we say
they're hopeless

29:14.686 --> 29:16.889
if they've never
been given a chance?

29:17.023 --> 29:19.992
What if... what if we tried
a little experiment, Diane?

29:20.126 --> 29:22.628
As you know,
my Gala for Goodness,

29:22.761 --> 29:26.465
the "hashtag charity event
of the year," is coming up.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.334
If I can prove
to everyone at that gala

29:28.467 --> 29:29.869
that the Bad Guys have changed,

29:30.002 --> 29:32.504
will you set them free
and give them a clean start?

29:34.073 --> 29:36.142
-What? Professor Marmalade!
-- Ow!

29:36.275 --> 29:38.510
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't you see what he's doing?

29:38.644 --> 29:40.146
He's playing you.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.347
But it was my idea.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.614
It was his idea.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.616
But only because
you made him have it.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.953
Madam Governor,
you can't just let them go.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.355
Professor, I'm not about to put
the safety of the city

29:49.488 --> 29:51.423
on the line for an experiment.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.059
Excuse me, Madam Governor.

29:53.192 --> 29:56.795
I seem to remember that
a wise person once said,

29:56.929 --> 30:01.133
"Even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful."

30:04.770 --> 30:06.072
Okay. I'm game.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.740
But only because it's you,
Professor.

30:08.875 --> 30:09.976
No!

30:10.109 --> 30:12.178
We'll hold on to the Dolphin
until the gala.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.581
Just to remove
any unnecessary temptation.

30:15.714 --> 30:17.749
Of course. Good thinking.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.818
That's why you're governor.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.221
Now that everyone's happy...

30:22.354 --> 30:23.689
Not happy.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.325
...I, Rupert Marmalade
the Fourth,

30:26.458 --> 30:28.394
will turn the Bad Guys into...

30:28.527 --> 30:30.262
-the Good Guys!

30:34.867 --> 30:37.136
I think these belong to you.

30:37.269 --> 30:38.670
Hey.

30:39.771 --> 30:42.408
- Not everyone gets
a second chance.

30:42.541 --> 30:46.612
Make the most of it,
Mr. Poodleton.

30:55.121 --> 30:57.323
-- Wolf?

30:57.456 --> 30:58.624
What are you doing?

30:58.757 --> 31:00.192
-- What?
-- Yeah.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.261
Oh, that.

31:02.394 --> 31:05.097
I-I-I'm sorry.
I thought it was, uh, obvious.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.266
We're gonna go good.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.169
Uh, you totally lost me.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.404
I told him to stop drinking
out of the toilet.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.473
Hey, did you get hit
on the head?

31:14.606 --> 31:15.841
What? No, I didn't
get hit on the head.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.543
My cousin got hit on
the head with an anchor,

31:17.676 --> 31:19.311
and after that,
he only swam in a circle.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.513
- No, no, g-guys, guys,
you're not following me.

31:21.647 --> 31:24.550
We're gonna pretend to go good.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.218
Just a few days with Marmalade.

31:26.352 --> 31:30.356
And then we roll into the gala
as Good Guys

31:30.489 --> 31:33.692
and roll out scot-free with...

31:33.825 --> 31:36.628
The Golden Dolphin.

31:36.762 --> 31:37.896
You got it.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.166
Since when do we not
finish a job?

31:40.299 --> 31:43.569
The Bad Guys become
the Good Guys

31:43.702 --> 31:46.838
so we can stay the Bad Guys.

31:46.973 --> 31:49.408
-You know what I'm saying?

31:49.541 --> 31:50.943
Bad Guys acting good?

31:51.077 --> 31:52.778
It's the ultimate Bad Guy thing.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.213
It's fantastic.

31:54.346 --> 31:55.647
Wolf, you're a genius.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.685
It's gonna be, like,
the most relaxing con ever,

31:59.818 --> 32:01.287
like a vacation.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.655
Oh, oh. A con-cation.

32:05.557 --> 32:09.228
- Ooh! My parents met
on a con-cation.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.476
Oh, goody.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.045
WOLF
Wow.

32:26.178 --> 32:27.646
Big and fancy.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.948
Rodent's got taste. Okay.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.851
Huh. Almost makes me
want to be cute.

32:32.985 --> 32:36.355
- They say experience
is the best teacher.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.190
And they are wrong.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.558
I am.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.893
Good morning,
students of goodness.

32:42.028 --> 32:47.166
And welcome to the first day
of the rest of your best life.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.500
A giant butt.

32:48.634 --> 32:49.835
Huh?

32:49.968 --> 32:51.470
Uh, it's-it's not a butt.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.106
It's a lamp in the shape of

32:54.240 --> 32:56.375
the Love Crater Meteorite,
my greatest...

32:56.508 --> 32:58.444
-I wonder whose butt it is.
--- Uh...

32:59.245 --> 33:01.247
Once again, it's not a butt.
Thank you.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.249
It's a heart.
Now, as I was saying...

33:03.382 --> 33:05.651
-Then why does it have cheeks?
--Shut it!

33:05.784 --> 33:07.519
What? I've never seen
a heart with cheeks.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.121
It's not a...

33:09.255 --> 33:11.623
-Booty!
-It's not a butt! Not a butt!

33:11.757 --> 33:14.193
Does he know what a butt is?

33:14.326 --> 33:16.062
As I was saying,

33:16.195 --> 33:19.031
on the outside,
the five of you are villains,

33:19.165 --> 33:21.133
predators,
remorseless sociopaths.

33:21.267 --> 33:23.335
Oh, stop.
You're making me blush.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.204
But inside, there's a flower--

33:25.337 --> 33:28.174
the flower of goodness--
and when it blooms

33:28.307 --> 33:30.709
and you feel that tingle
of positivity

33:30.842 --> 33:32.344
radiating through your body,

33:32.478 --> 33:35.547
you're going to want to feel it
all the time.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.349
So we're going for a tingle?

33:37.483 --> 33:38.684
Not any tingle.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.919
The tingle of goodness,
which you'll feel

33:41.053 --> 33:44.290
in my state-of-the-art
Sharing Laboratory.

33:44.423 --> 33:48.327
Okay, Mr. Snake, I'm going
to give you a Push Pop.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.896
Great! Push Pop just for me!

33:51.029 --> 33:53.632
-No, to share.
-Why?

33:53.765 --> 33:55.634
Well, on a fundamental level,

33:55.767 --> 33:57.736
it's about putting
someone else's needs

33:57.869 --> 34:00.206
-ahead of your own.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.074
Oh, no. No way.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.942
Snake.

34:04.076 --> 34:06.678
All right, all right.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.680
This is going to taste
extra sweet,

34:08.814 --> 34:11.317
'cause I know how bad
you want it.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.721
Pop me, please. Ah...

34:19.625 --> 34:21.460
Nope. Sucker.

34:21.593 --> 34:22.694
-That's it!

34:22.828 --> 34:24.596
-I'll teach you to share!

34:26.031 --> 34:28.033
Mm, I like sharing.
It's yummy. Mm.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.868
SNAKE
Totally worth it.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.104
Well, that's terrifying.

34:32.238 --> 34:34.173
Let's try something simpler.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.708
A good person always
pays attention

34:36.842 --> 34:38.177
to the needs of others.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.846
Now, here's a kindly,
frail grandma.

34:42.981 --> 34:46.318
Mr. Piranha, help grandma
across the street.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.221
Sure, sure, sure.
I do this all the time.

34:50.021 --> 34:52.824
-Here you go, ma'am.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.793
Oh, he is totally gonna blow it.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.328
What was that? What did you say

34:56.462 --> 34:57.929
-You think I can't do this?

34:58.063 --> 35:00.366
-No, no, no, Piranha!

35:03.435 --> 35:05.304
Maybe simpler?

35:07.506 --> 35:10.276
Hey, look.
It's a cat stuck in a tree.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.411
It doesn't get much simpler
than that.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.446
Now, what in this scenario

35:14.580 --> 35:16.482
would give you that good tingle?

35:16.615 --> 35:18.083
Eating it?

35:18.217 --> 35:20.352
This is why I always carry
two pieces of bread with me.

35:20.486 --> 35:21.520
No.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.390
I want you to s...

35:24.523 --> 35:25.657
-Smack it.
-Skin it?

35:25.791 --> 35:27.426
-Stab it.
-Sauté it. -Sing to it?

35:27.559 --> 35:29.328
Save it. I want you to sa...

35:29.461 --> 35:31.597
That's obv... It's so obvi...
I want you to save it.

35:31.730 --> 35:32.998
Oh!

35:33.131 --> 35:34.900
-Right, right.
-Right, right, right. Sure.

35:35.901 --> 35:38.470
-Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.540
Whoa, that cat is
obviously defective.

35:41.673 --> 35:42.841
What is wrong with you?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.510
You're gonna give it
a heart attack.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.312
I'll handle this.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.415
-What's up, papa!

35:51.049 --> 35:53.352
Get him off my face!
He's on my face!

35:53.485 --> 35:55.654
No, no, no, no, no, listen!
Wh-What are you doing?

36:00.459 --> 36:03.995
Okay. What, may I ask,
are you good at?

36:04.129 --> 36:05.631
Stealing stuff.

36:05.764 --> 36:06.832
Oh, yeah, we're great at that.

36:06.965 --> 36:07.933
-Robbery.
-Larceny.

36:08.066 --> 36:09.134
-Wire fraud.
-Extortion.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.636
-Tax evasion.
-Heists.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.504
-- Mail fraud.
-Wait. Heists, you say?

36:12.638 --> 36:14.973
Well, that's... yeah,
that's kind of our specialty.

36:15.106 --> 36:17.576
I might just have an idea.

36:17.709 --> 36:20.946
Free the pigs! Free the pigs!

36:21.079 --> 36:23.782
That is an animal testing lab.

36:23.915 --> 36:26.352
Within, 200,000 helpless
guinea pigs,

36:26.485 --> 36:30.489
all being poked and prodded
by sadistic scientists.

36:30.622 --> 36:31.890
Guinea pigs, you say?

36:32.023 --> 36:33.492
Snake.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.893
I want you to rescue them.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.028
But this is a heist for good,

36:37.162 --> 36:40.532
so I brought something
more friendly for you to wear.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.834
-Bye.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.736
Well, there goes
our street cred.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.538
At least it's comfy.

36:48.173 --> 36:51.009
- All right, we need
to distract that scientist.

36:51.142 --> 36:53.111
-Shark, you're up.
-Copy that.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.347
Okay. We're gonna need
a rope and a hook.

36:55.481 --> 36:57.048
-I got this one.
-- What?

36:57.182 --> 36:58.317
You're volunteering?

36:58.450 --> 37:00.018
You've never volunteered
for anything.

37:00.151 --> 37:01.820
Sure, I did. Right now.

37:01.953 --> 37:04.089
-Uh...
-Throw me up there. Giddyap!

37:04.222 --> 37:05.591
-Really?
-Yep.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.259
I'm 99% sure you can make it.

37:07.393 --> 37:09.160
-Okay.
-Let's do it!

37:10.061 --> 37:11.563
Hey there, son.

37:11.697 --> 37:12.764
Dad?

37:12.898 --> 37:14.466
I know you've got
an important job,

37:14.600 --> 37:17.002
but I hope you still have time
for a catch with your old man.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.272
-Hey, kiddo. -Huh?
-- 96% sure.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.073
You'll always be my special boy.

37:22.207 --> 37:23.609
-Aw.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.176
Maybe 90%.

37:25.311 --> 37:27.646
I've been waiting
my entire life for this moment.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.948
-SNAKE I don't know.
-Okay. Now, go long.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.650
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

37:31.783 --> 37:34.786
Thank you, Daddy!

37:34.920 --> 37:37.323
50... What day is it?

37:37.456 --> 37:38.590
Who am I?

37:38.724 --> 37:40.326
- Right.
The guinea pigs are locked

37:40.459 --> 37:42.328
behind a three-foot-thick
steel door.

37:42.461 --> 37:44.530
The only way in
is through the vents.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.231
I got it.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.068
I have never seen him
so chipper.

37:50.201 --> 37:51.903
Has he been meditating?

38:00.579 --> 38:01.980
Oh.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.483
Snake attack.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.152
Oh. Hey, look,
it's Professor Marmalade.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.588
Yes, that's right. It's me.

38:09.721 --> 38:11.056
Help has arrived.

38:11.189 --> 38:13.392
Just keep your eyes glued
to that door.

38:13.525 --> 38:16.495
Snake. Come on, Snake. Open up.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.829
Relax.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.098
These doors are complicated.

38:20.231 --> 38:22.000
-- Are you kidding me?

38:22.133 --> 38:23.402
What do you think you're doing?

38:23.535 --> 38:25.236
We're supposed to save them,
not eat them.

38:25.371 --> 38:27.873
Well, I'd say they've gone
to a better place.

38:29.274 --> 38:30.342
All right, that's it.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.977
-Spit them out.
-Hey.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.679
Hey!

38:33.812 --> 38:35.347
We gonna save you
whether you like it or not.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.015
We're saving you,
you stupid hair balls.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.385
Not that door. The other door.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.353
Hey, hey.

38:41.487 --> 38:42.354
Whoa!

38:42.488 --> 38:43.622
Any second.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.834
It-it's not what it looks like.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.677
Trespassing, burglary, mayhem,

39:05.811 --> 39:07.946
assault with a deadly reptile?

39:08.079 --> 39:09.581
As if those poor rodents

39:09.715 --> 39:11.583
haven't been through
enough already.

39:11.717 --> 39:12.851
No, Diane, please.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.553
Okay.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.523
I'm sorry, Professor,
but I'm calling the chief.

39:17.656 --> 39:18.490
Please. Come on.

39:18.624 --> 39:19.891
This experiment is over.

39:20.025 --> 39:20.926
Experiments take time.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.260
You couldn't help yourself?

39:22.394 --> 39:23.695
So I had a moment of weakness.
Sue me.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.531
That's gonna be difficult to do
from prison.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.799
Guys, what do we do now?

39:29.501 --> 39:33.104
Hmm. Time to launch
a charm offensive.

39:33.238 --> 39:36.742
Oh, yeah. The full Clooney.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.677
Madam Governor.

39:38.810 --> 39:39.778
Diane.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.413
Do not Clooney me, Wolf.

39:41.547 --> 39:43.749
Oh, I see what's going on.
You think I'm still a Bad Guy,

39:43.882 --> 39:46.117
trying to bamboozle
my way to freedom.

39:46.251 --> 39:47.753
But we've changed.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.221
That flower of goodness is
blossoming all over the place.

39:50.355 --> 39:53.058
Don't you ever
get tired of lying?

39:53.191 --> 39:54.726
No.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.094
I mean... Fudge.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.729
That was... that was
a trick question, right?

39:57.863 --> 40:00.766
I gave you an opportunity--

40:00.899 --> 40:02.300
a chance to show the world

40:02.434 --> 40:04.603
that you're more than just
a scary stereotype--

40:04.736 --> 40:06.538
but you're too proud

40:06.672 --> 40:09.140
or too gutless
to take advantage of it.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.042
Gutless? I'm gutless?

40:11.176 --> 40:12.277
Oh.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.812
I'm sorry, have we met?

40:13.945 --> 40:15.280
I'm the villain of every story.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.648
Guilty until proven innocent.

40:16.782 --> 40:19.885
Even if by some miracle
we did change,

40:20.018 --> 40:21.720
who's gonna believe us, huh?

40:21.853 --> 40:23.655
Of course you wouldn't know
anything about that,

40:23.789 --> 40:27.659
with your Little Miss Perfect
power suits.

40:28.660 --> 40:29.861
Is that so?

40:29.995 --> 40:31.463
Wait a second.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.264
What did... How did you...

40:33.398 --> 40:37.636
A wolf and a fox
are not so different.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.772
Maybe they will believe you,
maybe they won't,

40:40.906 --> 40:42.273
but it doesn't matter.

40:42.407 --> 40:44.710
Don't do it for them.
Do it for you.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.345
This is a chance
to write your own story.

40:47.479 --> 40:50.448
To find a better life for you
and your friends.

40:51.249 --> 40:53.018
Come on,
what have you got to lose?

40:53.151 --> 40:55.120
I don't know. My dignity?

40:56.287 --> 40:59.691
Yeah, well,
that ship has already sailed.

41:05.664 --> 41:08.466
Believe it or not,
I'm rooting for you, Wolf.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.436
So you're not gonna
call the chief?

41:12.237 --> 41:15.140
-I'll see you at the gala.

41:49.908 --> 41:52.277
I think we got off
to a bad start.

41:52.410 --> 41:54.412
The name's Wolf.

41:57.082 --> 41:58.784
Yep.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.251
I get that a lot.

42:00.385 --> 42:02.621
First impressions and all.

42:06.257 --> 42:07.893
No, no, no, no.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.034
Uh, it's okay. It's okay.

42:16.167 --> 42:18.103
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I know you're scared.

42:18.236 --> 42:20.338
I would be, too, if I were you.

42:21.272 --> 42:22.841
Just give me a chance.

42:24.242 --> 42:27.212
Truth is we actually have
a lot in common.

42:27.345 --> 42:29.214
Don't tell anyone,

42:29.347 --> 42:32.083
but I love a little scratch

42:32.217 --> 42:34.385
on the spot behind my ears.

42:34.519 --> 42:36.221
You know, right there.

42:36.354 --> 42:38.423
The best.

42:43.028 --> 42:45.797
Come on, kitty.

43:03.682 --> 43:06.017
-Yeah. Who's a good kitty?

43:06.151 --> 43:08.053
-Who's a good kitty?
-- Uh, Wolf?

43:08.186 --> 43:10.989
Um, you saved him?

43:11.122 --> 43:12.390
Yes!

43:12.523 --> 43:15.460
Yes. It's working.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.828
You-you filmed that?

43:16.962 --> 43:19.397
Yes, and they're starting
to like you.

43:19.530 --> 43:20.565
SHARK
Yeah!

43:20.699 --> 43:22.433
-All right!

43:22.567 --> 43:23.702
This might just be enough

43:23.835 --> 43:25.170
to win over the guests
at the gala.

43:25.303 --> 43:27.272
-Now we're talking!
-Yes! -All right!

43:27.405 --> 43:30.008
Yeah, we did it! All right!

43:30.141 --> 43:31.777
Uh, Wolf?

43:31.910 --> 43:34.312
I must say,
you've really turned a corner.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.314
-You're really getting it.
-Really?

43:36.447 --> 43:38.016
-Oh, uh, thanks.

43:38.149 --> 43:39.184
Now, I mean it.

43:39.317 --> 43:41.252
And I can see it
from tip to tail.

43:42.020 --> 43:45.556
It's just a shame that you
have to carry all that baggage.

43:46.424 --> 43:48.927
What are you talk...
You mean the guys?

43:49.060 --> 43:50.328
What do you mean?

43:50.461 --> 43:51.830
You have great potential, Wolf,

43:51.963 --> 43:53.431
but at some point,
you're going to have to choose

43:53.564 --> 43:56.702
between your friends
or the good life.

44:05.576 --> 44:07.746
Hey. You still awake?

44:09.547 --> 44:11.116
You-you brought the cat in?

44:11.249 --> 44:12.951
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

44:13.084 --> 44:15.020
I'm just...
I'm just saving it up for later.

44:15.153 --> 44:16.554
Why? What's up?

44:17.388 --> 44:19.024
I was just getting
a little worried,

44:19.157 --> 44:20.826
since you've kind of become a...

44:20.959 --> 44:22.928
-Become a what?

44:23.061 --> 44:25.096
You know, teacher's pet.

44:25.230 --> 44:27.432
Getting all cozy with Marmalade.

44:27.565 --> 44:29.534
Your tail wagging
and everything.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.636
Well, yeah, because
it has to be believable.

44:31.770 --> 44:34.505
Uh-huh. Yeah, I guess so.

44:34.639 --> 44:37.242
As long as it's all
part of the plan.

44:38.109 --> 44:40.678
It is all part of the plan,
isn't it?

44:40.812 --> 44:43.949
Snake, buddy,
who made the plan to begin with?

44:44.082 --> 44:45.483
You did.

44:45.616 --> 44:49.087
So I'm the one who sticks
to the plan the most, right?

44:50.722 --> 44:52.290
Yeah, ri... Uh, yeah, ok...

44:52.423 --> 44:54.659
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

44:54.793 --> 44:57.195
But if the plan
were ever to change,

44:57.328 --> 45:00.031
you'd-you'd tell me, right?

45:02.533 --> 45:04.669
You have my word.

45:04.803 --> 45:06.838
Go bad...

45:07.638 --> 45:09.540
Or go home.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.550
-Hey, Snake. -Yeah?

45:19.684 --> 45:21.887
You ever wonder
what it'd be like?

45:22.020 --> 45:24.689
The world loving us
instead of being scared of us?

45:24.823 --> 45:26.724
You ever...
you ever think about that?

45:26.858 --> 45:27.993
Loving us?

45:28.126 --> 45:29.527
Yeah, right.

45:29.660 --> 45:31.596
I don't waste time
thinking about stuff

45:31.729 --> 45:33.264
that's never gonna happen.

45:33.398 --> 45:37.803
I can't wait for things
to get back to normal.

45:44.843 --> 45:47.445
Yeah. Back to normal,
back to normal.

45:55.954 --> 45:58.456
What up?
We are just moments away

45:58.589 --> 46:00.491
from Professor Marmalade's
Gala for Goodness,

46:00.625 --> 46:02.660
where the legendary
Love Crater Meteorite

46:02.794 --> 46:05.797
will be on display
for the first time ever.

46:05.931 --> 46:08.566
But what everyone
is really buzzing about

46:08.699 --> 46:12.037
is the Bad Guys, whose
heart-melting rescue video

46:12.170 --> 46:16.007
has made them an overnight
viral sensation.

46:17.442 --> 46:19.477
All right, guys,
this is the big one.

46:19.610 --> 46:21.212
The Golden Dolphin

46:21.346 --> 46:22.814
is inside a titanium case

46:22.948 --> 46:24.782
controlled by a randomly
generated five-digit code,

46:24.916 --> 46:26.451
a code kept safe and secure

46:26.584 --> 46:29.487
inside a briefcase handcuffed
to the chief of police.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.489
She's not messing around.

46:31.622 --> 46:33.191
- The code is only
accessible with

46:33.324 --> 46:34.926
-her authorized fingerprints.
-- Leave that to me.

46:35.060 --> 46:36.995
While Snake gets the code,

46:37.128 --> 46:38.496
Shark will secure
the fake Dolphin.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.231
I like the sound of that.

46:40.365 --> 46:42.100
- Meanwhile, the rest of us
plant circuit jammers.

46:42.233 --> 46:44.202
- Allowing me
to hack into the power grid.

46:44.335 --> 46:45.904
- At the end of the night,
we toast the professor,

46:46.037 --> 46:47.939
"Blah-blah-blah, yada yada,"

46:48.073 --> 46:50.475
and when I say "Marmalade,"
lights go out,

46:50.608 --> 46:53.411
and we'll have exactly
four seconds to make our move.

46:53.544 --> 46:55.446
The old switcheroo.

46:55.580 --> 46:58.249
- Chief hands Marmalade
the fake Dolphin,

46:58.383 --> 47:01.352
we get our pardon, applause,
applause, exit stage right,

47:01.486 --> 47:03.955
and by the time they realize
what happened...

47:04.089 --> 47:05.656
So long, suckers!

47:05.790 --> 47:07.425
...we'll be driving off
into the sunset,

47:07.558 --> 47:08.726
legacy cemented.

47:08.860 --> 47:10.195
-- Nice.

47:10.328 --> 47:11.596
Got to hand it to you, buddy.

47:11.729 --> 47:13.664
You're a real artist.

47:16.267 --> 47:18.203
Well, Good Guys, this is it.

47:18.336 --> 47:19.737
Good luck out there.

47:19.871 --> 47:23.708
Remember, all eyes will be
on you tonight, not me.

47:23.841 --> 47:27.712
Friends, meet the Good Guys!

47:33.418 --> 47:35.420
Uh, this is different.

47:35.553 --> 47:37.522
-Is this a prank?
-What's that sound?

47:37.655 --> 47:39.724
Like screaming
but not terrified.

47:39.857 --> 47:42.693
All right, guys,
let's, uh... let's mingle.

47:42.827 --> 47:44.996
It's crime time, baby.

47:49.634 --> 47:51.036
-Hmm?
-- There you go.

47:57.242 --> 47:59.310
Okay, fake Dolphin,
fake Dolphin, fake Dolphin.

47:59.444 --> 48:00.645
Bingo.

48:00.778 --> 48:02.780
-Mr. Shark, Mr. Shark!
-Ooh!

48:02.914 --> 48:05.183
Is it true sharks
can smell blood a mile away?

48:05.316 --> 48:07.452
What? No. That's freaky.

48:13.091 --> 48:14.825
-Oh, Mr. Wolf! Mr. Wolf!
-Hey. Whoa.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.294
It is a pleasure to meet you.

48:16.427 --> 48:18.229
-Pleasure is all mine.
-I loved your video.

48:18.363 --> 48:20.165
Can I get a picture for my kids?

48:20.298 --> 48:22.700
Uh, hey, just a minute, guys.
Let me... let me, uh...

48:22.833 --> 48:25.136
I got... I'll be right back.

48:27.572 --> 48:31.676
Okay, Wolf, what are you up to?

48:32.643 --> 48:34.679
Yeah, with criminals like this,

48:34.812 --> 48:38.149
you got to be crafty,
subtle, invisible.

48:38.283 --> 48:41.619
And then the moment
they let their guard down...

48:41.752 --> 48:43.721
-whammo!

48:43.854 --> 48:45.056
You gotta spring the trap!

48:45.190 --> 48:47.625
Always one step ahead.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.261
I think I've earned
a tonic water.

48:50.395 --> 48:52.563
Put it in a fun glass, huh?

48:52.697 --> 48:54.499
Oh! Nice.

48:56.501 --> 48:58.103
-Oh, no.

48:58.236 --> 49:00.005
Hey.

49:04.609 --> 49:06.477
-Hey.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.113
That's right.

49:08.246 --> 49:10.281
-Be intimidated.

49:11.416 --> 49:12.984
Mm.

49:14.652 --> 49:15.987
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

49:23.428 --> 49:24.495
-What?
-Hmm?

50:11.342 --> 50:12.343
Mr. Wolf.

50:12.477 --> 50:14.145
Diane. Yeah, what a surprise.

50:14.279 --> 50:15.746
You know,
if I didn't know better,

50:15.880 --> 50:17.282
I'd think that
you were avoiding me.

50:17.415 --> 50:18.616
Avoiding you?

50:18.749 --> 50:20.418
Wh-Why would I do that?

50:21.419 --> 50:22.787
Okay.

50:22.920 --> 50:26.457
But I have to say,
I'm a little disappointed.

50:27.258 --> 50:30.228
I was hoping you were gonna
ask me to dance.

50:30.361 --> 50:31.562
Oh.

50:52.483 --> 50:55.286
I see.
You lost the sheep's clothing.

50:55.420 --> 50:58.323
Yeah. Figured it was time I got
comfortable in my own fur.

50:58.456 --> 51:00.091
- If you're
feeling good in here...

51:00.225 --> 51:02.560
I said, if you're feeling
good in here...

51:05.596 --> 51:06.997
I think I like the new you.

51:07.132 --> 51:08.566
Well, that makes two of us.

51:35.760 --> 51:39.029
Break out the umbrellas,
because it's raining money.

51:39.164 --> 51:41.599
All because of-- I can't even
believe I'm saying this--

51:41.732 --> 51:44.335
all because of the Bad Guys.

51:59.717 --> 52:01.452
So, how does it feel

52:01.586 --> 52:04.289
to have everyone
not fear you for a change?

52:12.029 --> 52:14.499
It feels good.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.100
Real good.

52:16.234 --> 52:17.835
Diane...

52:21.472 --> 52:23.308
It belongs to you.

52:51.769 --> 52:53.438
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Wolf.

52:53.571 --> 52:55.139
As you know,
the money raised tonight

52:55.273 --> 52:58.276
will be delivered tomorrow
to schools, hospitals

52:58.409 --> 53:00.445
and other worthy causes
across the city.

53:01.812 --> 53:03.981
Uh...

53:04.114 --> 53:07.151
I just want to take
a moment to recognize

53:07.285 --> 53:09.420
the one responsible
for our new outlook.

53:09.554 --> 53:12.056
Our brilliant mentor,

53:12.189 --> 53:13.791
-a paragon of enlightenment...
-Do it. -Come on.

53:13.924 --> 53:16.927
...the one and only
Professor...

53:19.564 --> 53:21.732
-- Wolf, do it.
-- ...uh, Professor...

53:23.268 --> 53:25.470
...um...

53:27.305 --> 53:29.440
...Professor Marmalade!

53:32.109 --> 53:34.379
Chief, may I do the honors?

53:37.548 --> 53:38.683
That's not the plan.

53:38.816 --> 53:39.850
What is happening?

53:39.984 --> 53:41.386
He's gone rogue.

53:42.853 --> 53:44.689
A deal's a deal.

53:45.723 --> 53:48.559
By the power vested in me,
it is a pleasure

53:48.693 --> 53:51.195
to grant the Bad Guys
a full par...

53:55.232 --> 53:57.802
-That was weird.
-- The meteorite is gone!

53:57.935 --> 53:59.304
Somebody stole it!

54:01.872 --> 54:03.274
-Chief.

54:03.408 --> 54:05.276
-Wolf.
-Come on.

54:05.410 --> 54:07.044
You can't possibly think
that we did this.

54:07.177 --> 54:09.380
So long, suckers!

54:10.481 --> 54:11.882
Run!

54:12.016 --> 54:13.351
Get them!

54:20.758 --> 54:23.093
Uh...

54:26.797 --> 54:28.466
Here. Here.

54:28.599 --> 54:31.168
-What are you doing?
-I'm giving it all back.

54:31.302 --> 54:32.403
Huh?

54:32.537 --> 54:34.605
-Excuse me.

54:37.642 --> 54:40.144
-What happened back there?
-I couldn't do it.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.012
What do you mean,
you couldn't do it?

54:42.146 --> 54:43.414
-I-I-I just... I...
-No!

54:43.548 --> 54:45.850
-I do not run.
-- Hut, hut, hut...

54:45.983 --> 54:47.652
That is not how I roll.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.587
Piranha,
don't do anything crazy.

54:51.188 --> 54:54.492
Crazy is what I bring
to the party, chico.

55:02.367 --> 55:03.734
Hey, you're making a mistake.

55:03.868 --> 55:04.835
We didn't do it.

55:04.969 --> 55:06.103
I know we always say that,

55:06.236 --> 55:07.304
but this time
it's actually true.

55:07.438 --> 55:09.306
A-la-la-la-la. Can't hear you.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.542
-Guilty, guilty, guilty.
-Talk to Marmalade.

55:11.676 --> 55:13.478
We're really good now.
He'll tell you.

55:13.611 --> 55:14.712
Professor!

55:14.845 --> 55:17.114
Tonight's headline:
Change is impossible.

55:17.247 --> 55:19.116
You should always judge
a book by its cover,

55:19.249 --> 55:21.486
and all stereotypes
have been affirmed.

55:21.619 --> 55:23.220
Stop, for goodness' sake!

55:23.354 --> 55:24.655
Let me speak to them.

55:24.789 --> 55:27.324
I'm-I'm sure there's been
some misunderstanding.

55:28.125 --> 55:30.260
-Ah, Professor Marmalade.

55:30.395 --> 55:31.762
You've got five minutes.

55:31.896 --> 55:33.898
No deals this time.

55:34.031 --> 55:35.065
Y-You have to help us.

55:35.199 --> 55:36.734
Tell 'em.
Tell 'em we didn't do it.

55:36.867 --> 55:38.736
There, there.
Of course you didn't do it.

55:38.869 --> 55:40.004
How could you?

55:40.137 --> 55:43.508
After all,
you're such a good boy.

55:44.308 --> 55:47.678
You're such a good boy.

55:47.812 --> 55:49.514
That shiver up my spine.

55:49.647 --> 55:51.882
The wag in my tiny tail.

55:52.016 --> 55:53.250
Arrest them!

55:53.384 --> 55:55.152
What if we tried
a little experiment, Diane?

55:55.285 --> 55:57.588
As you know,
my Gala for Goodness...

55:57.722 --> 55:59.957
- Where the legendary
Love Crater Meteorite

56:00.090 --> 56:02.627
will be on display
for the first time ever.

56:02.760 --> 56:06.063
All eyes will be
on you tonight, not me.

56:06.897 --> 56:08.132
You're such a...

56:08.265 --> 56:10.568
Good boy.

56:11.569 --> 56:12.970
You.

56:13.103 --> 56:14.672
It was all you.

56:14.805 --> 56:16.206
What are you talking about,
Wolf?

56:16.340 --> 56:17.608
The old lady,
the Golden Dolphin,

56:17.742 --> 56:19.477
good training--
it was all to get us here,

56:19.610 --> 56:21.846
so he could steal the meteorite
and let us take the fall.

56:21.979 --> 56:23.648
Whoa. Whoa, what old lady?

56:23.781 --> 56:26.283
And-and why would a guinea pig
want a meteorite anyway?

56:29.319 --> 56:32.122
Uh, guys, he's creeping me out.

56:32.256 --> 56:33.858
Wait, what? What's going on?

56:33.991 --> 56:35.259
Someone turn me around.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.027
Well, well.

56:37.161 --> 56:39.063
So, you finally get it.

56:39.196 --> 56:40.598
-Wait.
-What?

56:40.731 --> 56:42.199
You stole the meteorite?

56:42.332 --> 56:44.301
Oh, it's not just a meteorite.

56:44.435 --> 56:45.870
I told you guys it's a butt.

56:46.003 --> 56:47.204
It's not a butt!

56:48.673 --> 56:51.141
It's the ultimate power source.

56:51.275 --> 56:54.144
You see, when it struck,
scientists found that

56:54.278 --> 56:56.013
it emitted
an electromagnetic frequency

56:56.146 --> 56:58.082
unlike anything else on Earth.

56:58.215 --> 56:59.884
I'm going to harness its power

57:00.017 --> 57:03.220
to pull off the greatest heist
the world has ever seen.

57:04.021 --> 57:05.956
You should've eaten him
when you had the chance.

57:06.090 --> 57:07.558
-Yep.
-But why us?

57:07.692 --> 57:09.927
Because you're
the perfect patsies.

57:10.060 --> 57:13.531
Come on, when people look up
"bad" in the dictionary,

57:13.664 --> 57:16.133
do they see a sweet,
adorable guinea pig?

57:16.266 --> 57:18.135
No. They see you.

57:18.268 --> 57:20.505
And they always will.

57:20.638 --> 57:21.906
Okay, fine.

57:22.039 --> 57:23.307
But you set us up.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.709
Oh, pish-pish.

57:24.842 --> 57:27.678
Let's be honest--
evolution set you up.

57:27.812 --> 57:30.014
But Wolfie here
really clinched it.

57:30.147 --> 57:32.950
You fell for every one
of my traps,

57:33.083 --> 57:36.887
starting with saving
a helpless little old lady.

57:37.021 --> 57:40.190
Wolf, what's he talking about?

57:42.459 --> 57:43.994
Whoops.

57:44.128 --> 57:46.864
Did I say too much?

57:46.997 --> 57:49.333
Anyhoo, looks like, yet again,

57:49.466 --> 57:53.103
the Big Bad Wolf got outsmarted
by a little piggy.

57:53.237 --> 57:56.073
You little pouchy-cheeked rat!

57:56.206 --> 57:57.608
I'll kill you! You hear me?

57:57.742 --> 57:59.877
-You're dead! You're de...
-Help! Help! Help!

58:00.010 --> 58:01.646
The Big Bad Wolf
is attacking me.

58:01.779 --> 58:04.314
Oh, now you are done
forever, Wolf!

58:13.558 --> 58:15.392
-- Professor, Professor,

58:15.526 --> 58:17.461
any thoughts
on how the Bad Guys managed

58:17.595 --> 58:19.997
to steal the meteorite
in plain sight?

58:20.130 --> 58:21.365
Well, off the top of my head,

58:21.498 --> 58:23.233
perhaps they accessed the site
previously

58:23.367 --> 58:24.635
and set up an intricate system

58:24.769 --> 58:26.303
-of tunnels and trapdoors...
-- Uh-huh.

58:26.436 --> 58:27.772
- ...that could be
remotely triggered

58:27.905 --> 58:29.373
to suck the meteorite down
into a holding area,

58:29.506 --> 58:31.075
-but how should I know?
-- Totally.

58:31.208 --> 58:33.944
- I mean, they're the
deranged masterminds, not me.

58:56.166 --> 58:58.636
I'm giving it all back.

59:22.492 --> 59:24.228
- I can't believe
we got double-crossed

59:24.361 --> 59:25.663
by a tiny rodent.

59:25.796 --> 59:28.132
Oh, we got double-crossed
by a rodent all right,

59:28.265 --> 59:30.968
-but, uh, not a tiny one.
-What?

59:31.101 --> 59:33.604
This was supposed to be
us conning Marmalade.

59:33.738 --> 59:36.907
It turns out
it was Wolf conning us.

59:38.709 --> 59:40.577
Does that sound familiar
to you, Wolf?

59:40.711 --> 59:42.379
Why-why would you think that?

59:42.512 --> 59:45.115
Oh, I don't know, maybe because
you just sabotaged

59:45.249 --> 59:47.351
the biggest heist of our lives.

59:47.484 --> 59:50.587
I think you owe us
an explanation, buddy.

59:52.156 --> 59:53.257
Okay. You're right.

59:53.390 --> 59:54.925
This is what happened.

59:55.059 --> 59:57.594
Back in the museum, I just tried
to steal an old lady's purse.

59:57.728 --> 59:59.563
-Classic snatch and grab.

59:59.697 --> 1:00:01.899
Tried to? Since when do you try

1:00:02.032 --> 1:00:03.901
to steal something
and not just steal it?

1:00:04.034 --> 1:00:07.271
I was trying to steal the purse
when the old lady fell and...

1:00:07.404 --> 1:00:09.373
I kind of helped her.

1:00:09.506 --> 1:00:10.407
-What?

1:00:10.540 --> 1:00:12.509
I kind of helped her.

1:00:12.643 --> 1:00:14.511
-But then you stole her purse.

1:00:14.645 --> 1:00:15.946
No, I didn't.

1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:18.448
I saved the old lady,
and she hugged me,

1:00:18.582 --> 1:00:21.085
and my tail wagged,
and I didn't know what it was,

1:00:21.218 --> 1:00:24.588
but it felt, uh,
you know... good.

1:00:26.323 --> 1:00:27.357
Ah.

1:00:27.491 --> 1:00:29.293
But then you stole the purse.

1:00:29.426 --> 1:00:30.861
No!

1:00:30.995 --> 1:00:33.230
You know, I heard
what the pig said to you

1:00:33.363 --> 1:00:34.932
about cutting us loose.

1:00:35.065 --> 1:00:36.734
Wait. Like, "us" us?

1:00:36.867 --> 1:00:38.836
But I never thought
you'd actually do it, man.

1:00:38.969 --> 1:00:40.404
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:00:40.537 --> 1:00:42.940
I-I would never...
I was trying to...

1:00:43.073 --> 1:00:45.142
I was trying to find us
a better life.

1:00:45.275 --> 1:00:48.746
Our life was perfect
until you decided to ruin it.

1:00:48.879 --> 1:00:50.080
I didn't.

1:00:50.214 --> 1:00:51.648
You guys felt it at the gala.

1:00:51.782 --> 1:00:53.617
The clapping, the cheering.

1:00:53.751 --> 1:00:56.020
We were more than...
than just scary villains.

1:00:56.153 --> 1:00:57.254
They loved us.

1:00:57.387 --> 1:00:59.824
Oh, yeah?
If they loved us so much,

1:00:59.957 --> 1:01:03.560
how come we're in prison
for a crime we didn't commit?

1:01:03.694 --> 1:01:05.830
You know what?
I'll give Marmalade this.

1:01:05.963 --> 1:01:07.998
At least he sees the world
for what it is:

1:01:08.132 --> 1:01:10.267
a place where
some people are scary

1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:12.302
and some people are scared.

1:01:12.436 --> 1:01:13.670
Oh, yeah?

1:01:13.804 --> 1:01:15.372
Well, I'm tired of being scary.

1:01:15.505 --> 1:01:17.074
I'm-I'm tired of
being an outcast.

1:01:17.207 --> 1:01:18.809
Maybe I don't want to be a...

1:01:18.943 --> 1:01:20.277
What? A Bad Guy?

1:01:20.410 --> 1:01:22.446
Don't want to be
a Bad Guy anymore, huh?

1:01:22.579 --> 1:01:24.681
Say it, Wolf.

1:01:26.751 --> 1:01:28.218
Yeah, I thought so.

1:01:28.352 --> 1:01:30.354
And us, your lifelong friends?

1:01:30.487 --> 1:01:31.956
We're just holding you back?

1:01:32.089 --> 1:01:33.891
Yeah, maybe you are!

1:01:36.260 --> 1:01:37.862
Take it back!

1:01:37.995 --> 1:01:40.464
-Take it back! Apologize!

1:01:40.597 --> 1:01:42.332
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1:01:42.466 --> 1:01:43.968
Prison is no place for fighting.

1:01:45.569 --> 1:01:47.371
Tell that to him.

1:01:47.504 --> 1:01:48.839
Huh?

1:01:52.977 --> 1:01:55.545
-What?

1:02:12.229 --> 1:02:13.798
-Shh.

1:02:29.746 --> 1:02:31.949
Run!

1:02:38.388 --> 1:02:39.957
-Oh!
-W-W-Wait, wait. Ho-Hold on.

1:02:42.359 --> 1:02:43.293
Diane?

1:02:43.427 --> 1:02:44.561
But how do you know how to do

1:02:44.694 --> 1:02:45.863
all of that
kick-kick-punch-punch?

1:02:45.996 --> 1:02:48.232
Wait a sec,
you're the Crimson Paw?

1:02:50.767 --> 1:02:52.236
The queen of cons,

1:02:52.369 --> 1:02:53.637
acrobatic Swiss Army knife.

1:02:53.770 --> 1:02:55.105
Stole the Zumpango diamond
twice.

1:02:55.239 --> 1:02:57.607
Once for profit,
second time just for fun.

1:02:57.741 --> 1:03:00.144
Never identified, never caught.

1:03:00.277 --> 1:03:03.113
Guess I'm still
the best bad guy

1:03:03.247 --> 1:03:05.115
the world has ever seen.

1:03:05.249 --> 1:03:07.684
-Ugh, at least I used to be.

1:03:07.818 --> 1:03:09.153
-- Huh?

1:03:18.495 --> 1:03:20.197
Nope, I'm still the best.

1:03:20.330 --> 1:03:22.732
Just like riding
a stolen bicycle.

1:03:22.867 --> 1:03:25.402
Oh, uh, you got a little...
Ouch.

1:03:25.535 --> 1:03:27.604
Hey, wh-why did you
save us anyway?

1:03:27.737 --> 1:03:29.840
After the gala,
I knew something wasn't right,

1:03:29.974 --> 1:03:31.976
so I did some investigating,
and that meteor...

1:03:32.109 --> 1:03:35.379
I know. Some kind of cosmic
mega-super-antennae thing.

1:03:35.512 --> 1:03:38.215
Right. If conducted through
an array of ionized crystals,

1:03:38.348 --> 1:03:40.217
it will generate a massive
psychokinetic field

1:03:40.350 --> 1:03:41.551
the size of a city.

1:03:41.685 --> 1:03:43.020
Oh, my gosh.
Did I interrupt you?

1:03:43.153 --> 1:03:44.254
Were you gonna say that?

1:03:44.388 --> 1:03:46.957
Uh, I-I-I was gonna be
a little more technical,

1:03:47.091 --> 1:03:49.994
-but you got the gist of it.

1:03:51.061 --> 1:03:54.198
Marmalade needs to be stopped,
but I can't do it alone.

1:03:54.331 --> 1:03:56.433
You know his compound
better than anyone.

1:03:56.566 --> 1:03:58.202
You can count on us.

1:03:58.335 --> 1:03:59.503
Right, guys?

1:03:59.636 --> 1:04:01.538
There is no "us."

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:03.207
We're through, Wolf.

1:04:03.340 --> 1:04:04.741
Done. Finito.

1:04:04.875 --> 1:04:07.211
Because of that little tiff
back there?

1:04:07.344 --> 1:04:09.546
Come on, man, that's what we do.

1:04:09.679 --> 1:04:11.248
You serve, I volley.

1:04:11.381 --> 1:04:13.350
That's our little dance.

1:04:13.483 --> 1:04:15.552
Not this time.

1:04:20.324 --> 1:04:21.725
Piranha?

1:04:25.095 --> 1:04:26.296
Webs?

1:04:26.430 --> 1:04:28.032
Sorry, Wolfie.

1:04:29.799 --> 1:04:31.101
Shark.

1:04:31.235 --> 1:04:32.602
Hmm.

1:04:32.736 --> 1:04:34.404
Hey.

1:04:34.538 --> 1:04:36.106
Guys?

1:04:37.074 --> 1:04:38.375
Guys?

1:04:39.176 --> 1:04:42.712
You want to know why
I hate birthdays, Wolf? Do you?

1:04:44.048 --> 1:04:47.817
When you grow up a snake,
nobody shows up to your party.

1:04:47.952 --> 1:04:50.921
Birthdays are a constant
reminder that out there

1:04:51.055 --> 1:04:56.060
I'm just a scary,
good-for-nothing monster.

1:04:57.494 --> 1:04:59.163
Yeah.

1:04:59.296 --> 1:05:02.099
But nothing compares
to having the one guy...

1:05:02.232 --> 1:05:05.502
the one guy I thought
I could trust

1:05:05.635 --> 1:05:07.737
stab me in the back.

1:05:11.241 --> 1:05:13.910
Come on, guys.
Let's get out of here.

1:06:00.991 --> 1:06:05.029
Now, this is what
a true bad guy looks like.

1:06:11.068 --> 1:06:13.903
What do you say
we have some fun?

1:06:52.809 --> 1:06:55.545
Hey. You okay?

1:06:55.679 --> 1:06:57.314
No, I'm not okay.

1:06:57.447 --> 1:07:00.150
I'm very, very un-okay.

1:07:01.451 --> 1:07:03.320
Just left the only friends
I have ever had,

1:07:03.453 --> 1:07:06.790
so what am I...
what am I doing?

1:07:09.593 --> 1:07:12.396
I know this isn't easy,

1:07:12.529 --> 1:07:14.664
leaving everything behind.

1:07:14.798 --> 1:07:16.133
-Do you?
-Yeah.

1:07:16.266 --> 1:07:18.602
I was the best thief
in the world.

1:07:18.735 --> 1:07:22.606
Fast, fearless, inventive.

1:07:22.739 --> 1:07:25.575
I just had one thing
left to steal.

1:07:25.709 --> 1:07:27.344
The Golden Dolphin.

1:07:27.477 --> 1:07:29.346
So you went after it.

1:07:29.479 --> 1:07:31.348
I didn't just go after it.

1:07:32.516 --> 1:07:34.418
I had it.

1:07:34.551 --> 1:07:36.786
And a clear escape route.

1:07:39.356 --> 1:07:41.325
But...

1:07:41.458 --> 1:07:43.960
all I saw in the end
was the tricky fox

1:07:44.094 --> 1:07:46.863
that they always told me I was.

1:07:47.897 --> 1:07:50.100
It changed everything.

1:07:50.234 --> 1:07:52.702
So, now,
instead of hurting people,

1:07:52.836 --> 1:07:54.404
I'm helping them.

1:07:54.538 --> 1:07:56.106
I'm still me.

1:07:56.240 --> 1:07:59.343
I'm just me on the right side.

1:08:00.810 --> 1:08:02.279
You're doing the right thing.

1:08:02.412 --> 1:08:05.882
And someday your friends,
if they're real friends,

1:08:06.015 --> 1:08:08.218
I think they'll understand.

1:08:09.085 --> 1:08:11.155
Now, come on, let's get inside.

1:08:11.288 --> 1:08:14.124
-You look like you just busted
out of a prison. -

1:08:17.661 --> 1:08:18.995
-Guinea pigs?

1:08:19.129 --> 1:08:20.464
Marmalade.

1:08:20.597 --> 1:08:21.598
Let's bounce.

1:08:23.500 --> 1:08:26.136
So this is the hideout
of the great Crimson Paw.

1:08:27.671 --> 1:08:28.805
Snack break?

1:08:28.938 --> 1:08:30.674
Okay, oddly timed,
but you do you.

1:08:32.008 --> 1:08:33.042
Identity verified.

1:08:33.177 --> 1:08:35.412
-What?
-Welcome, Diane.

1:08:41.151 --> 1:08:44.221
-Whoa! Holy moly!

1:08:44.354 --> 1:08:46.656
It's so good to be home.

1:08:46.790 --> 1:08:47.891
Are you kidding me?

1:08:48.024 --> 1:08:49.659
Laser-sighted zip line?

1:08:49.793 --> 1:08:52.362
The XM-2400 radar jammer?
No way.

1:08:52.496 --> 1:08:54.631
I actually prefer
the earlier model.

1:08:54.764 --> 1:08:56.533
Agree to disagree.

1:08:56.666 --> 1:08:58.268
Uh, this stuff is nice, too.

1:08:59.569 --> 1:09:00.904
Yeah, that's a blowtorch.

1:09:01.037 --> 1:09:03.039
Also, not really your color.

1:09:04.474 --> 1:09:06.142
All righty, Marmalade.

1:09:06.276 --> 1:09:09.813
What are you up to,
you fuzzy little weirdo?

1:09:09.946 --> 1:09:11.481
We need eyes on the city.

1:09:11.615 --> 1:09:12.949
Let's see if we can't hack

1:09:13.082 --> 1:09:14.351
into the government's
surveillance satellite.

1:09:14.484 --> 1:09:16.220
But you're the governor.
Couldn't you just ask?

1:09:16.353 --> 1:09:18.522
Yeah, but...
the paperwork.

1:09:23.393 --> 1:09:27.163
I am definitely picking up
on suspicious activity here.

1:09:27.297 --> 1:09:29.466
Those are guinea pig
heat signatures.

1:09:29.599 --> 1:09:31.868
Marmalade seems to be
controlling them.

1:09:32.001 --> 1:09:34.003
But to do what?

1:09:34.137 --> 1:09:35.572
There are no obvious targets.

1:09:37.574 --> 1:09:39.976
That's because
they're moving targets.

1:09:40.109 --> 1:09:43.079
His charity fundraiser.

1:09:43.213 --> 1:09:45.482
He's gonna steal the money
raised in his own name?

1:09:45.615 --> 1:09:48.151
It's the greatest heist
the world's ever seen.

1:09:48.285 --> 1:09:50.320
$1 billion inside trucks,

1:09:50.454 --> 1:09:52.456
on their way to charities
all over the city.

1:09:52.589 --> 1:09:53.990
We need to cut off
Marmalade's communication

1:09:54.123 --> 1:09:55.158
with his guinea pig army.

1:09:55.292 --> 1:09:56.826
If there's no signal...

1:09:56.960 --> 1:09:58.161
There's no heist.

1:09:58.295 --> 1:10:00.397
We have to steal the meteorite.

1:10:00.530 --> 1:10:01.631
That was very cute,

1:10:01.765 --> 1:10:03.199
-that thing we just did there.
-All right.

1:10:03.333 --> 1:10:05.702
Put on your big-girl pants.
We're gearing up.

1:10:11.708 --> 1:10:13.009
I wouldn't take that.

1:10:13.142 --> 1:10:14.678
Those things rip your pants
right off.

1:10:14.811 --> 1:10:16.513
Huh. Try wearing
clean underwear.

1:10:16.646 --> 1:10:18.448
Just in case.

1:10:19.416 --> 1:10:20.550
Wha...

1:10:21.885 --> 1:10:24.153
You stole my car?

1:10:24.288 --> 1:10:25.555
Respect.

1:10:25.689 --> 1:10:28.325
-Let's do this.

1:10:39.769 --> 1:10:40.770
-No!
-What?

1:10:40.904 --> 1:10:42.272
All our stuff?

1:10:43.072 --> 1:10:44.574
-Where is everything?
-No, no, no, no, no.

1:10:44.708 --> 1:10:46.376
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
-All our stuff.

1:10:46.510 --> 1:10:48.278
-It's all gone.
-My disguise closet!

1:10:48.412 --> 1:10:50.647
-- Where's my things?

1:10:51.748 --> 1:10:54.017
Wolf gave away all our loot.

1:10:54.150 --> 1:10:56.453
We stole it fair and square.

1:10:56.586 --> 1:10:58.588
Now I understand
what it feels like

1:10:58.722 --> 1:11:01.358
to have things stolen from you.

1:11:01.491 --> 1:11:03.192
I don't like it!

1:11:03.327 --> 1:11:06.029
I really don't like it!

1:11:11.535 --> 1:11:14.037
- We got no food.
We got no money.

1:11:14.170 --> 1:11:15.572
We got no money
we could use to buy food.

1:11:15.705 --> 1:11:17.674
No food we can sell for money.

1:11:17.807 --> 1:11:19.876
We...

1:11:20.009 --> 1:11:22.078
All right, okay, okay.

1:11:22.211 --> 1:11:24.481
Here, here. Take it.

1:11:24.614 --> 1:11:26.650
Now, stop crying, buddy.

1:11:29.353 --> 1:11:33.990
Um, Snake, what did you just do?

1:11:34.123 --> 1:11:35.792
What? My friend was sad.

1:11:35.925 --> 1:11:37.361
I was just cheering him up.

1:11:37.494 --> 1:11:39.863
You... you did a good thing.

1:11:39.996 --> 1:11:41.865
-For me.
-Don't be ridiculous.

1:11:41.998 --> 1:11:44.200
I just put your needs
before my own.

1:11:44.334 --> 1:11:46.703
-Yeah. You're being good.
-I'm not.

1:11:46.836 --> 1:11:49.739
I was simply making a sacrifice
so Shark could be happy.

1:11:49.873 --> 1:11:52.876
That is the actual definition
of being good.

1:11:53.009 --> 1:11:54.911
Snake, you,

1:11:55.044 --> 1:11:57.146
the worst one of us,
the most selfish.

1:11:57.280 --> 1:11:58.748
-Spiteful.
-Terrible.

1:11:58.882 --> 1:11:59.983
-Sneaky.
-Dishonest.

1:12:00.116 --> 1:12:01.150
-Insensitive.
-Manipulative.

1:12:01.284 --> 1:12:02.652
-Snakelike.
-Stanky.

1:12:02.786 --> 1:12:04.688
And your point is?

1:12:04.821 --> 1:12:06.590
I think Wolf was right.

1:12:06.723 --> 1:12:09.726
Maybe we could be more
than just scary villains.

1:12:13.162 --> 1:12:14.197
Wh...?

1:12:14.330 --> 1:12:16.032
Oh, wow.

1:12:16.165 --> 1:12:18.668
Is this... is this wagging?

1:12:19.669 --> 1:12:21.337
We're-we're wagging.

1:12:23.139 --> 1:12:25.842
No, no, no!

1:12:25.975 --> 1:12:30.079
We'll always be Bad Guys!

1:12:56.005 --> 1:12:58.442
Faster, faster, my little pigs.

1:13:42.251 --> 1:13:44.020
Once we steal the meteorite,

1:13:44.153 --> 1:13:45.889
we take it straight
to the police.

1:13:46.022 --> 1:13:47.624
And all will be forgiven.

1:13:47.757 --> 1:13:51.194
I don't know about "all,"
but it's a start.

1:14:10.446 --> 1:14:11.915
That's strange.

1:14:12.048 --> 1:14:15.151
Why would Marmalade leave
the Golden Dolphin unprotected?

1:14:15.284 --> 1:14:18.154
-Because maybe it's a trap.
-Or maybe...

1:14:18.287 --> 1:14:20.423
-Wait, wait, wait!

1:14:21.190 --> 1:14:22.325
Yeah, it was a trap.

1:14:22.458 --> 1:14:23.893
Well, well, well.

1:14:24.027 --> 1:14:26.496
If it isn't my prized pupil.

1:14:26.630 --> 1:14:28.698
And you've brought along
the governor.

1:14:28.832 --> 1:14:30.166
Or should I say...

1:14:30.299 --> 1:14:31.768
-the Crimson Paw?

1:14:31.901 --> 1:14:36.706
Mm, what an ingenious way
to disguise a Zumpango diamond,

1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:39.042
hiding it in plain sight.

1:14:39.175 --> 1:14:41.144
You got to be kidding me.

1:14:41.277 --> 1:14:43.012
What? I'm sentimental.

1:14:43.146 --> 1:14:44.648
You always did have panache.

1:14:44.781 --> 1:14:47.684
And yet, you still fell
right into my trap.

1:14:47.817 --> 1:14:50.053
But how did you know
we'd even be here?

1:14:50.186 --> 1:14:53.222
Oh, I got a little tip
from a friend.

1:14:54.858 --> 1:14:56.159
Hey, buddy.

1:14:56.292 --> 1:14:57.594
How's it hanging?

1:14:57.727 --> 1:15:00.229
-Snake.

1:15:00.363 --> 1:15:02.098
What can I say? We just clicked.

1:15:02.231 --> 1:15:05.902
Oh, yeah? How's it feel to be
working for your favorite food?

1:15:06.035 --> 1:15:07.937
Ah, you're just jealous

1:15:08.071 --> 1:15:10.339
to be missing out
on the heist of the century.

1:15:10.473 --> 1:15:12.141
It's got everything:

1:15:12.275 --> 1:15:15.178
betrayal, a meteor,
mind control.

1:15:15.311 --> 1:15:16.713
Can I try it on?

1:15:16.846 --> 1:15:18.514
Of course, partner.

1:15:18.648 --> 1:15:22.586
Nice. All the crime
with none of the exercise.

1:15:24.020 --> 1:15:25.822
What about all that
"flower of goodness" talk?

1:15:25.955 --> 1:15:27.123
Was it all just a lie?

1:15:27.256 --> 1:15:28.925
Uh, pretty much, yeah.

1:15:29.058 --> 1:15:31.260
You see, I never cared
about what's "good."

1:15:31.394 --> 1:15:33.362
Only what's good for me.

1:15:33.496 --> 1:15:35.965
Like, say, a billion dollars.

1:15:36.099 --> 1:15:38.868
Ooh, I just got a tingle.

1:15:40.336 --> 1:15:41.838
Go bad...

1:15:41.971 --> 1:15:44.040
Or go home.

1:15:44.173 --> 1:15:46.676
Cuddles, finish them.

1:15:55.384 --> 1:15:56.853
Poison gas.

1:15:56.986 --> 1:15:58.254
Don't breathe it in.

1:15:58.387 --> 1:16:00.256
Wait a second.

1:16:00.389 --> 1:16:02.125
That's not poison gas.

1:16:04.027 --> 1:16:04.928
-- Sorry!

1:16:06.229 --> 1:16:07.330
Surprise!

1:16:07.463 --> 1:16:10.266
What? Ah, guys.

1:16:10.399 --> 1:16:11.835
I can't believe it's you.

1:16:11.968 --> 1:16:14.403
-You were right, Wolfie.
-We felt the wag, man.

1:16:14.537 --> 1:16:16.105
-- And the tingle.
-It's good, right?

1:16:16.239 --> 1:16:17.540
This is super moving,

1:16:17.674 --> 1:16:19.275
but can we do this later?

1:16:19.408 --> 1:16:21.711
Feels like I got
a rhythm section in my fin.

1:16:23.346 --> 1:16:25.214
-Ah, ah!
-- Ugh. Come on.

1:16:25.348 --> 1:16:26.249
Spinning blades!

1:16:26.382 --> 1:16:27.617
Oh, yeah. Right.

1:16:27.751 --> 1:16:28.952
Sorry. I got it.

1:16:31.254 --> 1:16:32.789
-Guys...

1:16:32.922 --> 1:16:35.424
Am I happy to see you.

1:16:38.361 --> 1:16:39.729
Now it's time to huff and puff

1:16:39.863 --> 1:16:41.831
and blow this little piggy's
heist down.

1:16:41.965 --> 1:16:43.566
Game over, guinea pig.

1:16:43.700 --> 1:16:47.003
With this meteorite,
we will be able to commit crimes

1:16:47.136 --> 1:16:49.072
people have only dreamed about.

1:16:49.205 --> 1:16:51.140
Not bad for a butt rock.

1:16:51.274 --> 1:16:54.110
Once again, it's not a...

1:16:54.243 --> 1:16:55.779
-Don't mind us.

1:16:55.912 --> 1:16:57.681
Just robbing this place.

1:17:00.116 --> 1:17:01.584
No, no, no!

1:17:07.523 --> 1:17:09.125
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

1:17:26.242 --> 1:17:27.677
-All right!
-We did it!

1:17:27.811 --> 1:17:30.513
Now to get this thing to
the chief and clear your names.

1:17:30.646 --> 1:17:32.749
Weird. Usually, we drive
away from the police.

1:17:32.882 --> 1:17:35.384
Hey, chico, are you sure
we stopped the heist?

1:17:35.518 --> 1:17:37.120
-Yeah.
-Relax.

1:17:37.253 --> 1:17:39.522
Marmalade can't control them if
he doesn't have the meteorite.

1:17:39.655 --> 1:17:41.891
So, who's driving those trucks?

1:17:45.294 --> 1:17:47.163
The meteorite.

1:17:47.296 --> 1:17:48.597
-It's still transmitting.
-Uh-oh.

1:17:48.732 --> 1:17:50.967
The charity money.
Change of plan, guys.

1:17:51.100 --> 1:17:52.601
Webs, is there some way
to override

1:17:52.736 --> 1:17:54.037
the truck's navigation system?

1:17:54.170 --> 1:17:55.338
Uh, we'd need some kind of

1:17:55.471 --> 1:17:57.240
magnetized cross-circuit
interceptor.

1:17:57.373 --> 1:17:59.342
You mean this?

1:17:59.475 --> 1:18:01.711
Ooh! She just keeps
getting cooler!

1:18:01.845 --> 1:18:02.912
Oh, yeah!

1:18:12.655 --> 1:18:14.991
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:18:18.561 --> 1:18:20.096
Oh, no.

1:18:21.230 --> 1:18:22.365
We got to split up.

1:18:22.498 --> 1:18:24.233
Webs, you feel like
a girls' trip?

1:18:24.367 --> 1:18:25.969
Um, yes.

1:18:26.102 --> 1:18:28.972
Later, boys.

1:18:34.310 --> 1:18:36.679
I want to go on the girls' trip.

1:18:47.456 --> 1:18:48.691
Woo-hoo!

1:18:53.763 --> 1:18:55.298
-You're insured, right?
-Yeah. Why?

1:18:56.665 --> 1:18:59.302
Hey! That's my car!

1:18:59.435 --> 1:19:02.205
It's ceviche, baby!

1:19:28.497 --> 1:19:30.967
So long, suckers.

1:19:48.017 --> 1:19:49.718
Where'd you learn to do that?

1:19:49.853 --> 1:19:52.288
Well, I'm, you know,
kind of a natural.

1:19:52.421 --> 1:19:54.057
Mostly YouTube.

1:19:55.024 --> 1:19:55.892
Nice work.

1:19:56.025 --> 1:19:57.460
Meet me at the police station.

1:19:57.593 --> 1:19:59.595
Don't be late.

1:20:00.563 --> 1:20:03.432
What do you say we deliver
this butt rock to the chief?

1:20:03.566 --> 1:20:05.334
-Yeah.

1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:12.408
Oh.

1:20:12.541 --> 1:20:14.343
No, no, no, no!

1:20:14.477 --> 1:20:16.279
That's my stolen money.

1:20:16.412 --> 1:20:18.114
What good are you
if you can't even

1:20:18.247 --> 1:20:19.482
anticipate their next move?

1:20:19.615 --> 1:20:21.284
-Oh, so it's my fault?
-Yes.

1:20:26.555 --> 1:20:28.491
-Chief.
-This better be good.

1:20:28.624 --> 1:20:30.994
Trust me,
you don't want to miss this.

1:20:31.127 --> 1:20:32.295
Look.

1:20:33.729 --> 1:20:35.598
Well, butter my crumpets.

1:20:35.731 --> 1:20:36.966
Can it be?

1:20:37.100 --> 1:20:39.335
The Bad Guys are returning
the meteorite?

1:20:39.468 --> 1:20:42.671
Perhaps this is
the feel-good story we all need.

1:20:42.805 --> 1:20:44.140
-Woo-hoo! Yeah!
-Woo-hoo! -All right!

1:20:44.273 --> 1:20:46.042
Do you guys think
they'll throw us a party?

1:20:46.175 --> 1:20:49.712
Yeah. With fireworks,
piñatas and cake.

1:21:06.095 --> 1:21:08.197
We can't do this without him.

1:21:08.998 --> 1:21:10.866
He might be
a Mr. Grumpy Pants...

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.502
But he's our Mr. Grumpy Pants.

1:21:13.636 --> 1:21:16.239
-Yeah.

1:21:17.573 --> 1:21:18.942
Wolf!

1:21:19.075 --> 1:21:21.978
I'm starting to see
why your friends dumped you.

1:21:22.111 --> 1:21:24.280
-I don't have any friends!

1:21:24.413 --> 1:21:26.983
Snake! Snake!

1:21:27.116 --> 1:21:28.384
Wolf?

1:21:28.517 --> 1:21:29.752
Snake, come back!

1:21:29.885 --> 1:21:31.387
We need you, baby!

1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:32.956
And you need us!

1:21:33.089 --> 1:21:37.060
Oh, there you go again,
making it personal.

1:21:37.193 --> 1:21:39.996
I'll give you one last chance
to give me the meteorite.

1:21:40.129 --> 1:21:43.066
Oh, yeah?
What you gonna do, Whiskers?

1:21:43.933 --> 1:21:45.401
-This.

1:21:46.669 --> 1:21:48.304
What the...?

1:21:54.443 --> 1:21:55.544
We've got adorable company.

1:21:55.678 --> 1:21:57.713
Floor it!

1:22:02.151 --> 1:22:03.686
Whoa!

1:22:06.089 --> 1:22:08.324
Maybe I shouldn't have
called him Whiskers.

1:22:15.731 --> 1:22:17.000
When I woke up this morning,

1:22:17.133 --> 1:22:19.468
this is not where
I saw the day going.

1:22:22.905 --> 1:22:24.107
Come on.

1:22:25.241 --> 1:22:26.742
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:22:26.875 --> 1:22:28.744
Hey, hey, let's dial this down
a notch, huh?

1:22:28.877 --> 1:22:30.546
Besides, you'll never get him.

1:22:30.679 --> 1:22:32.581
He's too good a driver.

1:22:32.715 --> 1:22:34.183
Hmm. You're right.

1:22:34.317 --> 1:22:36.752
But now that I think of it,
maybe it would be better

1:22:36.885 --> 1:22:38.521
to exploit
his greatest weakness.

1:22:38.654 --> 1:22:40.456
Exactly.

1:22:40.589 --> 1:22:42.925
Wait.

1:22:45.928 --> 1:22:47.896
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hold on.

1:22:48.031 --> 1:22:49.632
-Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1:22:49.765 --> 1:22:51.467
Okay, okay. You win.

1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:53.302
You can have the space rock.

1:22:53.436 --> 1:22:54.803
Good boy, Wolf.

1:23:04.980 --> 1:23:06.482
Take the wheel.

1:23:06.615 --> 1:23:07.783
Not so fast.

1:23:07.916 --> 1:23:11.220
Pull him up first,
or I'll use this.

1:23:11.354 --> 1:23:13.156
Oh, come now.

1:23:17.226 --> 1:23:19.928
Do it, or you'll lose the rock.

1:23:20.963 --> 1:23:22.398
If you insist.

1:23:22.531 --> 1:23:23.899
Cuddles!

1:23:30.839 --> 1:23:33.276
You want him? He's yours.

1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:39.582
Snake! No, no, no!

1:23:39.715 --> 1:23:41.584
-Snake!
-Oh, no!

1:23:54.830 --> 1:23:57.466
Guys, I know it's crazy,
but we're gonna jump it.

1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:00.469
Crazy? You're finally speaking
my language, chico.

1:24:10.779 --> 1:24:14.049
We're gonna make it!

1:24:14.950 --> 1:24:16.219
No!

1:24:21.524 --> 1:24:23.226
You came back.

1:24:26.162 --> 1:24:27.230
Snake.

1:24:27.363 --> 1:24:28.731
I should've been honest
with you.

1:24:28.864 --> 1:24:30.065
I was afraid that if you knew

1:24:30.199 --> 1:24:31.834
I-I wanted to be good
that you'd...

1:24:31.967 --> 1:24:34.870
Act like a jerk
and never talk to you again?

1:24:35.003 --> 1:24:36.672
Yeah.

1:24:36.805 --> 1:24:38.774
Point is I... I-I-I, you know...

1:24:38.907 --> 1:24:41.477
Yeah. I love you, too, buddy.

1:24:45.714 --> 1:24:47.383
This-this is so beautiful.

1:24:47.516 --> 1:24:49.918
Do you know how beautiful
this is, you guys?

1:24:50.052 --> 1:24:51.154
-Now...

1:24:51.287 --> 1:24:52.988
Now you're gonna make me cry.

1:24:53.122 --> 1:24:54.623
I know!

1:24:54.757 --> 1:24:56.225
So pathetic, right?

1:24:56.359 --> 1:24:58.294
Come on, guys.

1:24:58.427 --> 1:25:00.095
Who said it was the end?

1:25:13.942 --> 1:25:15.911
- No, no, no, don't...
No, no. Cuddles!

1:25:16.044 --> 1:25:17.680
We're losing altitude!

1:25:17.813 --> 1:25:20.015
We're losing altitude!
We're going down!

1:25:26.322 --> 1:25:28.224
What happened? Did we blow up?

1:25:28.357 --> 1:25:30.293
Is this heaven?

1:25:39.134 --> 1:25:41.003
CHIEF
That is it.

1:25:41.136 --> 1:25:42.638
Hey!

1:25:42.771 --> 1:25:45.808
There is absolutely no way
you're getting away this time.

1:25:45.941 --> 1:25:47.843
-Wait, Chief.
-Governor Foxington?

1:25:47.976 --> 1:25:49.178
-Don't do this.
-- Ow!

1:25:49.312 --> 1:25:50.613
They didn't steal the meteorite.

1:25:50.746 --> 1:25:51.914
They were bringing it back.

1:25:52.047 --> 1:25:54.049
Ha! How could you know that?

1:25:54.183 --> 1:25:57.085
Unless...
unless you were conspiring

1:25:57.220 --> 1:25:59.822
with a bunch of known criminals.

1:26:00.756 --> 1:26:02.691
Well...

1:26:02.825 --> 1:26:05.194
as a matter of fact,

1:26:05.328 --> 1:26:07.563
it's time I came clean
about something.

1:26:08.364 --> 1:26:11.667
The truth is I'm really...
r-really...

1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:14.270
Really a big fan
of redemption arcs.

1:26:14.403 --> 1:26:16.138
Yeah, we know.

1:26:21.577 --> 1:26:22.811
We're done running away.

1:26:22.945 --> 1:26:23.912
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

1:26:24.046 --> 1:26:25.748
-Yeah.
-Yep.

1:26:25.881 --> 1:26:27.750
Chief, do what you need to do.

1:26:27.883 --> 1:26:28.984
What?

1:26:29.117 --> 1:26:31.887
Y-You're turning yourself in?

1:26:32.020 --> 1:26:33.822
We might not have stolen
the meteorite,

1:26:33.956 --> 1:26:36.292
but we did steal
a lot of other things.

1:26:36.425 --> 1:26:38.827
It's time we took
some responsibility.

1:26:38.961 --> 1:26:41.129
Start a clean state.

1:26:41.930 --> 1:26:43.866
Take us in, Chief.

1:26:44.667 --> 1:26:46.101
Wow, really?

1:26:46.235 --> 1:26:47.536
You finally did it.

1:26:47.670 --> 1:26:48.871
This is your moment, Chief.

1:26:49.004 --> 1:26:50.239
Drink it in.

1:26:50.373 --> 1:26:51.507
Wow.

1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:52.975
You know, I should...
I should give a speech.

1:26:53.108 --> 1:26:54.243
I... Well, I-I should,
shouldn't I?

1:26:54.377 --> 1:26:56.078
-Uh...

1:26:56.211 --> 1:26:57.513
When I was six years old,

1:26:57.646 --> 1:26:59.282
I decided that I wanted
to play the piccolo,

1:26:59.415 --> 1:27:01.250
only to find that
my fingers were just

1:27:01.384 --> 1:27:04.086
too powerful for that
fragile little instrument.

1:27:04.219 --> 1:27:06.689
And that's when I discovered
law enforcement.

1:27:08.357 --> 1:27:10.025
I'm proud of you, Wolf.

1:27:10.158 --> 1:27:13.362
You know, a fox and a wolf
are not that different.

1:27:13.496 --> 1:27:15.431
You got a good thing
going here, Governor.

1:27:15.564 --> 1:27:17.700
So, it turns out the saga
of the Bad Guys

1:27:17.833 --> 1:27:21.337
has come to a simple and
totally satisfying conclusion.

1:27:21.470 --> 1:27:24.172
Though I wonder,
what happened to the meteorite?

1:27:24.307 --> 1:27:26.108
Cuddles! Faster, faster!

1:27:26.241 --> 1:27:27.810
It's Professor Marmalade!

1:27:27.943 --> 1:27:30.045
He's bringing
the meteorite back.

1:27:30.178 --> 1:27:32.681
-Huh? Uh, yes, yes.

1:27:32.815 --> 1:27:34.683
Bringing... bringing it back.

1:27:34.817 --> 1:27:36.552
That's precisely
what I am doing.

1:27:39.955 --> 1:27:41.890
Look no further.

1:27:42.024 --> 1:27:44.192
Your hero has arrived.

1:27:44.327 --> 1:27:45.761
Professor, care to comment?

1:27:45.894 --> 1:27:47.530
I tried to help them, Tiffany,

1:27:47.663 --> 1:27:50.333
but in the end,
it's the same old story.

1:27:50.466 --> 1:27:53.369
Bad guys bad, good guys good.

1:27:53.502 --> 1:27:55.003
So true. So wise.

1:27:55.137 --> 1:27:56.572
Furthermore,
for the good of the city,

1:27:56.705 --> 1:27:59.207
I have generously decided
to take the meteorite

1:27:59.342 --> 1:28:02.044
back to my compound
for safekeeping.

1:28:03.579 --> 1:28:05.180
Is he seriously gonna
get away with this?

1:28:05.314 --> 1:28:07.850
Thank you. Gosh, you're kind.

1:28:07.983 --> 1:28:09.785
Give it up for me!

1:28:09.918 --> 1:28:11.253
Wait a second.

1:28:11.387 --> 1:28:13.055
This isn't the meteorite.

1:28:13.188 --> 1:28:14.757
-It's a lamp.

1:28:14.890 --> 1:28:16.024
Huh?

1:28:16.158 --> 1:28:17.626
-- What?

1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:19.928
Snake, what did you just do?

1:28:20.062 --> 1:28:21.764
What? My friend was sad,

1:28:21.897 --> 1:28:23.031
and I was just cheering him up.

1:28:23.165 --> 1:28:24.667
I think Wolf was right.

1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:27.936
Maybe we could be more
than just scary villains.

1:28:31.106 --> 1:28:32.675
I'm bad. You're bad.

1:28:32.808 --> 1:28:34.142
Let's be bad together.

1:28:34.276 --> 1:28:36.512
You've got yourself a deal.

1:28:38.013 --> 1:28:40.883
-Can I try it on?
-Of course, partner.

1:28:55.531 --> 1:28:57.232
-Don't mind us.

1:28:57.366 --> 1:28:58.734
Just robbing this place.

1:29:03.038 --> 1:29:05.040
No, no, no!

1:29:08.744 --> 1:29:10.513
But if that's a lamp,
where is the...

1:29:11.780 --> 1:29:13.015
The old switcheroo.

1:29:42.745 --> 1:29:44.513
It's a butt.

1:29:51.286 --> 1:29:52.488
Hold on.

1:29:52.621 --> 1:29:54.890
This is the Zumpango diamond.

1:29:55.023 --> 1:29:56.825
But this was stolen by the...

1:29:58.461 --> 1:30:00.863
By the Crimson Paw.

1:30:00.996 --> 1:30:02.397
Me? Oh, oh, no, no, no.

1:30:02.531 --> 1:30:04.299
-OMG. -- No, no, no.
No, you've got it wrong.

1:30:04.433 --> 1:30:06.268
-And a shocking twist.
-You're making a huge mistake!

1:30:06.401 --> 1:30:09.672
The notorious bandit
known as the Crimson Paw

1:30:09.805 --> 1:30:11.406
-has been revealed to be...
-No! No!

1:30:11.540 --> 1:30:13.075
...none other
than Professor Marmalade.

1:30:13.208 --> 1:30:14.443
I'm not the Crimson Paw.

1:30:14.577 --> 1:30:16.211
-Sh-She's the Crimson Paw.

1:30:16.344 --> 1:30:17.913
Sh-She's the Paw!

1:30:18.046 --> 1:30:20.048
I'm a flower of goodness. No!

1:30:20.182 --> 1:30:22.250
Ooh! That's my reptile
right there.

1:30:22.384 --> 1:30:24.119
-That's what I'm talking about!
All right! -Yeah!

1:30:24.252 --> 1:30:26.388
Come on, somebody had to
destroy that meteorite.

1:30:26.522 --> 1:30:28.356
That thing was dangerous.

1:30:28.491 --> 1:30:30.358
That was pretty good there,
Snakey.

1:30:30.493 --> 1:30:32.728
Good? It was genius.

1:30:32.861 --> 1:30:34.563
Not only did I foil the pig,

1:30:34.697 --> 1:30:37.232
I got you to admit
how much you care about me.

1:30:37.365 --> 1:30:38.634
Sure, yeah.

1:30:38.767 --> 1:30:40.368
I just wonder about
one little thing.

1:30:40.503 --> 1:30:41.904
Oh, yeah? What's that, Wolf?

1:30:42.037 --> 1:30:46.241
Who do you think put that
one Push Pop in the fridge?

1:30:47.676 --> 1:30:48.977
Wait.

1:30:49.111 --> 1:30:50.646
You... No.

1:30:50.779 --> 1:30:52.114
I knew you were good.

1:30:52.247 --> 1:30:54.517
-No.

1:30:54.650 --> 1:30:57.452
-We good, baby. We good.
-Yeah!

1:31:41.897 --> 1:31:44.299
- Okay, so imagine
it's your birthday.

1:31:44.432 --> 1:31:45.801
It is my birthday.

1:31:45.934 --> 1:31:47.469
- Yeah, I know.
So, but we're walking along

1:31:47.603 --> 1:31:48.971
and you meet a genie.

1:31:49.104 --> 1:31:50.438
Okay. What's his name?

1:31:50.573 --> 1:31:51.807
What's the genie's name?

1:31:51.940 --> 1:31:53.441
Yeah, I want to know
who I'm talking to.

1:31:53.576 --> 1:31:54.977
I don't know,
Genie or Gene for short.

1:31:55.110 --> 1:31:56.645
So he offers you three wishes.

1:31:56.779 --> 1:31:57.813
Why three?

1:31:57.946 --> 1:31:59.081
You know, industry standard.

1:31:59.214 --> 1:32:00.482
Now, what do you wish for?

1:32:00.616 --> 1:32:02.250
-Uh...
-Good luck out there, guys.

1:32:02.384 --> 1:32:03.752
I'm gonna go with nothing.

1:32:03.886 --> 1:32:05.053
Nothing?

1:32:05.187 --> 1:32:06.622
Come on, it's your birthday.

1:32:06.755 --> 1:32:08.757
All right,
but what do I need wishes for?

1:32:08.891 --> 1:32:10.325
I got my freedom.

1:32:10.458 --> 1:32:11.393
-Hey.
-Guys!

1:32:11.526 --> 1:32:12.761
Looking good, hermanos.

1:32:12.895 --> 1:32:14.663
-I got my friends.
-- Aw.

1:32:14.797 --> 1:32:16.665
I got the skin of a reptile
half my age.

1:32:16.799 --> 1:32:19.101
I don't know about half
your age, but you do look good.

1:32:19.234 --> 1:32:20.569
Well, that's because
you just molted.

1:32:20.703 --> 1:32:22.805
-Yes, I did.
-- You smell good, too.

1:32:22.938 --> 1:32:26.374
-I'm shiny. I'm gorgeous.

1:32:32.180 --> 1:32:35.150
Uh, so what do we do now?

1:32:35.283 --> 1:32:37.052
-Steal a car?
-Piranha!

1:32:37.185 --> 1:32:38.854
I was joking.

1:32:38.987 --> 1:32:40.322
It was a joke.

1:32:40.455 --> 1:32:42.057
You know,
on second thought, Wolf,

1:32:42.190 --> 1:32:44.226
maybe I'd, uh, wish for a ride.

1:32:44.359 --> 1:32:46.428
-Oh, yeah? Alakazam.

1:32:48.697 --> 1:32:49.998
-Nice.

1:32:50.132 --> 1:32:52.968
-Hey, guys.
Ready to get to work? -

1:32:53.101 --> 1:32:54.269
Hey. Whoa.

1:32:54.402 --> 1:32:56.271
Aw.

1:32:59.107 --> 1:33:00.308
Hey, you.

1:33:00.442 --> 1:33:01.810
That's right. Come here.

1:33:01.944 --> 1:33:03.078
Little closer.

1:33:03.211 --> 1:33:04.780
I said closer.

1:33:04.913 --> 1:33:08.116
Now that we've had some time
to get acquainted, uh,

1:33:08.250 --> 1:33:10.753
not so scary now, are we?

1:33:10.886 --> 1:33:12.254
Webs, hit it.
