WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.473
(laughing)

00:02.473 --> 00:04.635
ELLIE, ARE YOU CRAZY?
DITCH THE WINE GLASS.

00:04.635 --> 00:06.377
(whispers)
HERE COMES THE FUZZ.

00:06.377 --> 00:07.708
WIFE OF THE MAYOR.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.380
(gasps)

00:09.380 --> 00:11.282
JUST BECAUSE ANDY IS
THE FIGUREHEAD MAYOR,

00:11.282 --> 00:13.344
YOU CAN DRINK ANYWHERE?

00:13.344 --> 00:14.645
THAT IS SO COOL.

00:14.645 --> 00:17.248
I ALSO GET HANDICAP PARKING,
FREE STAMPS,

00:17.248 --> 00:18.589
AND IF I NEED
A JAR OPENED,

00:18.589 --> 00:20.421
I JUST CALL
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.722
IF I WERE MAYOR,

00:21.722 --> 00:23.194
I WOULD GRANT MORE RIGHTS
TO ANIMALS.

00:23.194 --> 00:24.695
BUT ALSO,
MORE RESPONSIBILITY.

00:24.695 --> 00:27.328
ALL POTTY BUSINESS MUST
BE DONE BEHIND A TREE.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.729
AND IF A DOG
HAS A VISIBLE BEANBAG,

00:28.729 --> 00:30.331
HE'S GOTTA WEAR DOG PANTS.
UGH.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.103
WHAT? WHAT?
HEY.

00:32.103 --> 00:34.305
THE MAYOR'S WIFE CAN JUST
TAKE BOTTLES OF WINE?

00:34.305 --> 00:35.636
UH, NO, THAT'S MORE
OF AN ELLIE THING.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.309
WE SHOULD WALK FASTER.
OH.

00:38.309 --> 00:43.514
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:43.514 --> 00:47.778
ALL RIGHT, YOU EACH GET
ONE PIRATE JOKE.

00:47.778 --> 00:51.822
OKAY, WHAT IS A PIRATE'S,
UM, FAVORITE MOVIE?

00:51.822 --> 00:53.824
ONE THAT'S RATED "ARGH!"
(laughs)

00:53.824 --> 00:55.226
OKAY, I'M UP.

00:55.226 --> 00:58.429
LOOK...
IT'S CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW.

00:58.429 --> 01:01.532
BUT IT'S... NOT JOHNNY DEPP.
IT'S A GUY THAT'S...

01:01.532 --> 01:03.134
(lowered voice) SHORTER.

01:03.134 --> 01:05.766
IT'S STUPID BUCCANEER WEEK
IN GULFHAVEN.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.569
IT'S THIS DUMB EVENT TO GET
TOURISTS HERE TO SPEND MONEY.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.342
SINCE I'M MAYOR,
I HAVE TO...

01:13.374 --> 01:14.645
OKAY, DO-OVER.

01:14.645 --> 01:16.247
HEY, LOOK!

01:16.247 --> 01:17.678
IT'S PIRATE... LONG JOHN...

01:17.678 --> 01:20.651
SILVER NOT-SHORT... MAYOR.

01:20.651 --> 01:22.253
AH, I'M 0-FOR-2.

01:22.253 --> 01:23.684
OH.
THEY WANT ME TO SCHMOOZE

01:23.684 --> 01:25.456
ALL THESE RICH BUSINESS OWNERS
AND THEIR WIVES.

01:25.456 --> 01:28.619
SO I WAS HOPING I'D GET
A HAND FROM... CHARMING ELLIE?

01:28.619 --> 01:30.661
CHARMING ELLIE?
WELL, WHAT'S THAT?

01:30.661 --> 01:32.693
IT'S ELLIE BEING CHARMING.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.725
(laughs) COME ON.
SERIOUSLY, WHAT IS THAT?

01:34.725 --> 01:36.327
OH, I'M SERIOUS.

01:36.327 --> 01:39.600
I CAN TURN IT ON
WHEN I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.334
BUT CHARMING ELLIE
HASN'T BEEN OUT IN TEN YEARS,

01:43.334 --> 01:45.276
NOT SINCE
THE HOSTAGE SITUATION...

01:45.276 --> 01:46.707
(voice breaks) AT THE BANK.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.209
THEY WERE GONNA KILL US.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.710
(Bobby)
I'm so glad they didn't.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.242
OH, BOBBY AND I DECIDED
WE'D KEEP OUR PHONES

01:51.242 --> 01:53.184
ON SPEAKER ALL DAY.

01:53.184 --> 01:54.485
THAT WAY
WE DON'T MISS ANYTHING.
That way we don't miss anything.

01:54.485 --> 01:55.746
JINX!
Jinx!

01:55.746 --> 01:57.248
(laughs)

01:57.248 --> 01:58.819
ANYWAY, IF I MESS UP
THIS WEEK,

01:58.819 --> 02:00.651
THEY CAN SQUEEZE ME
OUT OF OFFICE.

02:00.651 --> 02:02.253
EH, WELL.

02:02.253 --> 02:04.124
WHICH MEANS NO MORE
DRINKING WINE IN PUBLIC.

02:04.124 --> 02:08.729
FINE. I'LL BE IRRESISTIBLY
CHARMING, YOU JACKASS.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.231
WAIT. DID IT START YET?

02:10.231 --> 02:12.903
I MEAN,
THAT WAS KINDA CHARMING.
YEAH.

02:12.903 --> 02:15.135
HEY, TAKE A PICTURE
OF THIS MOLE ON MY BACK.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.667
I DON'T HAVE A MIRROR
ON THE BOAT.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.439
DOG TRAVIS
HAS BODY ISSUES.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.171
I'M SURE HE DOES.
(camera shutter clicks)

02:20.171 --> 02:22.273
HEY, YOU KNOW,
I GOT A GIG TAKING PICS

02:22.273 --> 02:25.346
OF MAYOR TORRES
FOR BUCCANEER WEEK.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.147
(Andy)
Please, call me Mayor Andy.
(toilet flushing)

02:27.147 --> 02:28.649
(laughs)
YOU GUYS
KEEP YOUR PHONES ON

02:28.649 --> 02:29.880
WHEN YOU GO TO
THE BATHROOM?

02:29.880 --> 02:31.822
FRIENDSHIP DOESN'T STOP
TO PEE.

02:31.822 --> 02:33.424
I FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD.
I SHOULD GO.

02:33.424 --> 02:34.655
STUPID RICH JERK ROGER FRANK

02:34.655 --> 02:36.887
TOLD ME TO BE THERE
AT 10:00 SHARP.

02:36.887 --> 02:38.529
WHY ARE YOU SO WORRIED
ABOUT IMPRESSING ROGER?
(camera shutter clicks)

02:38.529 --> 02:40.231
YOU'RE THE MAYOR.

02:40.231 --> 02:41.932
YEAH, BUT HE'S THE HEAD
OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

02:41.932 --> 02:44.195
ON A CASUAL WHIM,
HE COULD JUST DRAIN

02:44.195 --> 02:47.538
THE CITY BUDGET OR TAKE AWAY
MY MAYORAL NETFLIX ACCOUNT.

02:47.538 --> 02:48.799
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA COME
WATCH ME SURF?
(camera shutter clicks)

02:48.799 --> 02:50.201
WITHOUT YOU HOLDING UP
SCORECARDS,

02:50.201 --> 02:51.542
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M DOING.

02:51.542 --> 02:54.245
(sighs) TIME TO GO
BE IMPORTANT.

02:54.245 --> 02:56.777
CONFIDENCE DANCE ME OUT?
OH, YEAH.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.579
OH, WHOO!

02:58.579 --> 03:00.351
GO GET 'EM PIRATE!
GO GET 'EM, YEAH!

03:00.351 --> 03:02.353
I WISH I HAD MORE FRIENDS.
(camera shutter clicks)

03:02.353 --> 03:05.486
WHY AREN'T YOU PEOPLE
COMING INTO MY SHOP?!

03:05.486 --> 03:07.758
THE NEXT PERSON THAT WALKS BY
WITHOUT BUYING

03:07.758 --> 03:09.590
ONE OF MY DELICIOUS CAKES
IS GETTING A SLICE

03:09.590 --> 03:10.821
JAMMED DOWN THEIR THROAT.

03:10.821 --> 03:12.323
WOW, THREATENING CUSTOMERS.

03:12.323 --> 03:13.694
ALWAYS A GOOD MOVE.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.566
LISTEN, CAN I BORROW
A BUNCH OF NAPKINS?

03:15.566 --> 03:17.528
MY BAR IS PACKED.

03:17.528 --> 03:20.871
OH, I GUESS PIRATES AREN'T
REALLY THAT INTO CAKE.

03:20.871 --> 03:22.733
MY BUSINESS IS CRASHING.

03:22.733 --> 03:24.335
I MEAN,
DON'T GET ME WRONG,

03:24.335 --> 03:26.307
I DIDN'T GET INTO THIS
BUSINESS FOR THE MONEY.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.978
I REALLY LOVE THE LOOK
ON A LITTLE KID'S FACE

03:27.978 --> 03:30.611
WHEN THEY SEE ONE OF
MY BUTTERFLY CAKES.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.514
UGH, I STILL NEED
THEIR STUPID PARENTS

03:33.514 --> 03:35.346
TO PAY FOR IT.

03:35.346 --> 03:37.718
HERE.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.690
DON'T WORRY.
PEOPLE WILL COME.

03:41.792 --> 03:44.295
TOM!
HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

03:44.295 --> 03:46.897
UH, BACHELOR PARTY FOR
A DERMATOLOGIST FRIEND OF MINE.

03:46.897 --> 03:49.460
UH, THESE SKIN DOCS REALLY
KNOW HOW TO PARTY.

03:49.460 --> 03:50.901
DO YOU WANNA BUY A CAKE
OR NOT?

03:50.901 --> 03:52.533
YES, IT'S A SPECIAL ORDER.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.505
CAN YOU MAKE... THAT?

03:54.505 --> 03:56.807
(gasps) OH, TOM! GROSS!

03:56.807 --> 03:59.570
I MEAN, YES, I'VE
OBVIOUSLY TRIED THAT BEFORE.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.912
BUT I'M NOT PUTTING IT
ON A CAKE. COME ON.

04:01.912 --> 04:03.774
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE
MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.

04:03.774 --> 04:05.716
WAIT.

04:05.716 --> 04:07.948
I'LL MAKE
YOUR FILTHY CAKE.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.781
SWEET! ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TALK ABOUT FLAVORS.

04:12.553 --> 04:15.025
AS THE OWNER
OF OVER A DOZEN BUSINESSES

04:15.025 --> 04:17.858
HERE IN GULFHAVEN,
I'M ALREADY VERY RICH.

04:17.858 --> 04:21.792
AND IF THIS BUCCANEER WEEK THING
TAKES OFF AND THE TOURISTS STAY,

04:21.792 --> 04:23.764
I'LL BE EVEN RICHER.
(camera shutter clicking)

04:23.764 --> 04:25.035
NOTHING WOULD MAKE
ME HAPPIER.

04:25.035 --> 04:26.667
I'VE TAKEN EVERY PRECAUTION
TO MAKE SURE

04:26.667 --> 04:30.471
THAT BUCCANEER WEEK GOES
FLAWLESSLY. (chuckles)

04:30.471 --> 04:32.643
(camera shutter clicks)

04:32.643 --> 04:34.305
(menacing theme playing)

04:34.305 --> 04:36.377
WHAT THE--

04:39.310 --> 04:44.515
AAH! OH, JELLYFISH!
KILLER JELLYFISH!

04:44.515 --> 04:46.587
I'VE ANTICIPATED EVERY
POSSIBLE PROBLEM.
(shutter continues clicking)

04:46.587 --> 04:48.288
BEEFED UP SECURITY.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.720
YOU HAVE MY GUARANTEE THAT
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

04:49.720 --> 04:52.763
WILL HAPPEN TO RUIN
BUCCANEER WEEK.

04:52.763 --> 04:54.465
GIANT KILLER JELLYFISH!

04:54.465 --> 04:57.398
HE'S GONNA KILL US ALL!
RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!

04:57.398 --> 04:59.299
OHH! NO!

04:59.299 --> 05:01.672
DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT.

05:01.672 --> 05:04.775
(imitates pirate voice) AHOY!
IT'S ME FAVORITE WENCHES.

05:04.775 --> 05:06.807
(normal voice) PIRATE TALK
IS WEIRDLY CATCHY.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.339
WELL, STOP.
'CAUSE ELLIE'S GOTTA GET

05:08.339 --> 05:10.641
HER GAME FACE ON.
SHE HAS TO CHARM

05:10.641 --> 05:12.012
THOSE SOCIALITE WENCHES
OVER THERE.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.784
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS CATCHY.

05:13.784 --> 05:15.085
RIGHT?
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET

05:15.085 --> 05:16.887
ANDY TALK ME INTO THIS.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW

05:16.887 --> 05:18.549
IF I CAN TURN ON
THE CHARM ANYMORE.

05:18.549 --> 05:21.051
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS HOW MUCH I WANNA SET FIRE

05:21.051 --> 05:23.594
TO THAT TOURIST'S WIG.

05:23.594 --> 05:26.357
OKAY, HIGH ENERGY.
THAT'S GOOD.

05:26.357 --> 05:28.429
NOW LET'S GET ARSON
OFF THE TABLE.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.902
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS,
ELLIE.

05:31.902 --> 05:33.964
I... THINK YOU CAN
DO THIS, ELLIE.

05:33.964 --> 05:37.368
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

05:37.368 --> 05:38.669
HAVE A STRONG DRINK READY.

05:38.669 --> 05:40.871
SHE'S GONNA TANK THIS
BIG-TIME.

05:40.871 --> 05:43.073
OH, HI!
THREE GIN MARTINIS.

05:43.073 --> 05:46.116
AND IF YOU'RE QUICK ABOUT IT,
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME STYLE ADVICE.

05:46.116 --> 05:48.579
THESE WAITRESSES OUTFITS
ARE HORRENDOUS.

05:48.579 --> 05:51.622
HI, BEV.

05:51.622 --> 05:54.124
I AM ELLIE TORRES,
THE MAYOR'S WIFE.

05:54.124 --> 05:55.656
I THINK I MET YOU
LAST YEAR

05:55.656 --> 05:57.357
AT THE POLICE GALA.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.660
ALTHOUGH, I SWEAR,
YOU LOOK EVEN YOUNGER TONIGHT.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.493
YOU'RE GULFHAVEN'S
BENJAMIN BUTTON.

06:02.493 --> 06:03.994
OH!
(women laugh)

06:03.994 --> 06:06.797
AND THE BARTENDERS MAY NEED
TO CHECK SOME I.D.s HERE.

06:06.797 --> 06:10.841
SIR, IT IS 'TINI TIME
FOR MY DARLING FRIENDS.

06:10.841 --> 06:14.945
WHO'S READY TO PARTY, GALS?
(chuckles)

06:14.945 --> 06:19.379
SHIVER ME TIMBERS!
WHO IS THAT?

06:22.152 --> 06:24.014
SO I SAID TO MY SEAMSTRESS,
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO?

06:24.014 --> 06:26.887
WEAR A SALMON CARDIGAN
WITH A PAISLEY SCARF?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.460
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM,
AN ESCAPED MENTAL PATIENT?

06:29.460 --> 06:33.163
(women laugh)

06:33.163 --> 06:37.698
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY DEAREST FRIEND.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.671
THIS IS JULES. LOVE.

06:40.671 --> 06:43.774
SHE'S THE TOWN'S PREMIERE
REAL ESTATE AGENT.

06:43.774 --> 06:46.907
SHE SINGLE-HANDEDLY
PUT HER SON THROUGH COLLEGE.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.611
SHE'S MY TOUCHSTONE
AND THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.443
AW.

06:52.443 --> 06:54.645
WELL, IT'S NICE

06:54.645 --> 06:56.116
HEY, GUYS.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.689
AND, UH, WHO IS THIS?

06:58.689 --> 07:04.054
THIS IS DR. THOMAS GAZELIAN,
GULFHAVEN'S OWN DON DRAPER.

07:04.054 --> 07:06.857
HE'S AN ACCOMPLISHED
NEUROSURGEON.

07:06.857 --> 07:09.700
AND RUMOR HAS IT,
HE'S QUITE THE LADIES MAN.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.161
(gasps)

07:11.161 --> 07:13.704
UH, I FEEL LIGHT-HEADED.
WHO'S HUNGRY?

07:13.704 --> 07:15.636
DO YOU GUYS WANNA GO GET
THE BEST TAPAS?

07:15.636 --> 07:17.007
OLГ©! (laughs)

07:17.007 --> 07:19.640
(chairs scrape floor)

07:19.640 --> 07:21.441
I DON'T WANT THIS TO END.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.143
I'M INTRIGUED,
BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE

07:23.143 --> 07:25.676
SHE'S GONNA DRAIN THEIR BLOOD
AND LEAVE 'EM ALL IN A DITCH.

07:25.676 --> 07:27.978
MAYBE.

07:27.978 --> 07:30.080
THERE'S A GIANT
KILLER JELLYFISH OUT THERE.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.652
HE LOOKED ME RIGHT
IN THE EYES,

07:31.652 --> 07:33.884
AND ALL I SAW WAS MURDER!
(Travis) SLOW DOWN,

07:33.884 --> 07:36.987
TAKE A DEEP BREATH,
TELL US WHAT YOU REALLY SAW.

07:36.987 --> 07:39.530
OKAY.

07:39.530 --> 07:41.992
THERE'S A GIANT KILLER JELLYFISH
OUT THERE, WHO LOOKED ME

07:41.992 --> 07:43.864
RIGHT IN THE EYES,
AND ALL I SAW WAS MURDER!

07:43.864 --> 07:45.165
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS MONSTER WAS, LIKE,

07:45.165 --> 07:46.897
20 FEET WIDE.

07:46.897 --> 07:48.969
ARE YOU SURE IT WASN'T
A BUNCH OF LITTLE JELLYFISH

07:48.969 --> 07:51.171
THAT LOOKED LIKE
ONE GREAT BIG ONE?

07:51.171 --> 07:52.943
YEAH, I SAW SOME LITTLE ONES.

07:52.943 --> 07:55.475
BUT THEY WERE GUARDING
THE BIG ONE, MAN.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.107
LIKE STORMTROOPERS
ON DARTH VADER.

07:57.107 --> 07:59.650
AN-DO, I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU GOTTA CLOSE THE BEACHES.

07:59.650 --> 08:01.912
DRUGS AND SURFING
DON'T MIX, SON.

08:01.912 --> 08:05.155
BOBBY, THIS WEEK IS VERY
IMPORTANT FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES.

08:05.155 --> 08:08.719
AND IF WE CLOSE THE BEACHES,
THEY'LL LOSE A LOT OF MONEY.

08:08.719 --> 08:13.924
OH, AN-DO, YOU BELIEVE ME NOW,
DON'TCHA?

08:13.924 --> 08:15.566
OF COURSE I DO.

08:15.566 --> 08:17.768
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL KEEP THE BEACHES SAFE.

08:17.768 --> 08:19.570
YEAH. I KNEW I COULD
COUNT ON YOU.

08:22.232 --> 08:25.005
I'VE ALWAYS SUSPECTED THAT
HE'S A TEENAGE BOY

08:25.005 --> 08:27.908
WHO MADE A WISH AT A CARNIVAL
TO BECOME BIG.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.911
YOU ARE NOT ACTUALLY
GOING TO LISTEN TO HIM.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.614
BOBBY'S GREAT, BUT HE'S NOT
EXACTLY KNOWN FOR BEING

08:33.614 --> 08:35.285
GROUNDED IN REALITY.

08:35.285 --> 08:38.549
(camera shutter clicking)
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL--I'LL HANDLE HIM.

08:38.549 --> 08:40.851
(Andy) He gets a little crazy
sometimes.

08:42.553 --> 08:44.524
IF I WANTED TO ADD
THE 3-BREASTED LADY

08:44.524 --> 08:45.796
FROM "TOTAL RECALL,"

08:45.796 --> 08:47.598
THAT WOULD JUST BE
THE REGULAR PRICE?

08:47.598 --> 08:49.299
YOU KNOW I CHARGE
BY THE BOOB.

08:49.299 --> 08:51.301
UH, EXCUSE ME.
UH, WHAT IS GOING ON?

08:51.301 --> 08:53.303
WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE
AN AIRPORT STRIP CLUB IN HERE?

08:53.303 --> 08:55.135
I MADE ONE NAUGHTY CAKE
FOR TOM,

08:55.135 --> 08:56.667
AND NOW I'M TAPPED INTO
A WHOLE NEW PART

08:56.667 --> 08:57.968
OF THE CAKE BUSINESS.

08:57.968 --> 08:59.710
(singsongy)
THE DIRTY PART.

08:59.710 --> 09:01.672
A TWEET FROM @DoctorTomG
HELPED SPREAD THE WORD.

09:01.672 --> 09:05.876
THAT'S @DoctorTomG--
D-O-C--
BE CAREFUL, LAURIE.

09:05.876 --> 09:07.718
THIS FEELS LIKE
A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

09:07.718 --> 09:10.320
IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE I SEE
YOUR LIPS MOVING,

09:10.320 --> 09:12.883
BUT ALL I'M HEARING IS
KA-CHING, KA-CHING.

09:12.883 --> 09:14.755
HI!

09:14.755 --> 09:17.588
I WOULD LIKE A NAUGHTY CAKE
FOR MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY.

09:17.588 --> 09:20.130
UM, I WANT IT TO BE ME,
NAKED,

09:20.130 --> 09:22.693
BUT THREE MONTHS
MORE PREGNANT.

09:22.693 --> 09:25.936
I'M GONNA NEED A LOT MORE
ORANGE FROSTING. (sighs)

09:27.838 --> 09:29.069
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.301
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT CHELLIE.

09:31.301 --> 09:32.903
THAT'S CHARMING ELLIE.

09:32.903 --> 09:36.076
TRAVIS, SHE IS SO MAGNETIC,
THAT SILVERWARE

09:36.076 --> 09:39.650
WILL JUST FLY ACROSS THE ROOM
AND STICK TO HER.

09:39.650 --> 09:42.312
OKAY, THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
BUT SHE IS AMAZING.

09:42.312 --> 09:43.814
ELLIE!

09:43.814 --> 09:45.786
COME SAY HI TO TRAVIS.

09:45.786 --> 09:49.660
WHY? DOES THAT PASTY-FACED
ART NERD HAVE SOMETHING

09:49.660 --> 09:51.992
INTERESTING TO SAY
FOR ONCE?

09:51.992 --> 09:55.325
TELL HIM I'M BORED ENOUGH
ALREADY AS IT IS.

09:55.325 --> 09:57.297
WHAT A PEACH.
THAT WAS ELLIE.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.999
CHELLIE IS GREAT.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.600
SHE IS SO NICE,
SHE WOULD'VE PUT

10:00.600 --> 10:02.202
A POSITIVE SPIN
ON YOUR PALENESS.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.774
SHE WOULD'VE CALLED YOU
"PORCELAIN."

10:03.774 --> 10:06.606
OKAY, WHOEVER CHELLIE IS,
IS GONE NOW.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.278
I DIDN'T EVEN REALLY
GET TO KNOW HER.

10:08.278 --> 10:10.681
WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO GO HAVE LUNCH

10:10.681 --> 10:13.884
AND LAUGH OVER SALADS,
LIKE WOMEN DO IN MAGAZINES.

10:13.884 --> 10:15.646
I GOTTA GET HER BACK.

10:15.646 --> 10:17.017
YOU CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE
YOUR FAVORITE PARTS

10:17.017 --> 10:18.388
OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

10:18.388 --> 10:20.250
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THEM
FOR WHO THEY ARE.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.293
HMM. YEAH,
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:23.293 --> 10:24.795
HEY, HAVE YOU EVER
THOUGHT ABOUT

10:24.795 --> 10:26.957
GETTING THAT CHIN DIMPLE
FILLED IN?

10:29.059 --> 10:30.701
SURE, THE OCEAN WAS MURKY
AND--AND YOU THOUGHT

10:30.701 --> 10:32.232
YOU SAW SOMETHING
YOU DIDN'T.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.935
SO IF YOU COULD TELL EVERYONE
THAT THE WATER'S SAFE,

10:34.935 --> 10:37.037
IT WOULD REALLY
HELP ME OUT.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.909
SURE, THEN.

10:38.909 --> 10:43.113
ANYTHING FOR
MY BEST FRIEND.

10:43.113 --> 10:45.415
THIS BUCCANEER WEEK
IS A KILLER.

10:45.415 --> 10:47.247
I'M PUTTING OUT FIRES
ALL OVER TOWN.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.050
HEY, WELL, DON'T LET THEM
NEAR MY CLEAVE CASH,

10:50.050 --> 10:53.183
BECAUSE I AM...
(singsongy) FLAMMABLE.

10:53.183 --> 10:55.155
I HAD TO PUT ON MY OLD
DOUBLE-"D" SHOPLIFTING BRA

10:55.155 --> 10:57.027
JUST TO FIT ALL THIS
IN THERE.

10:57.027 --> 10:58.859
IN MY DAY,

10:58.859 --> 11:01.762
I COULD FIT A HONEYBAKED HAM
AND A DVD BOX SET IN THERE.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.233
THAT'S A LOT OF CASH.

11:03.233 --> 11:05.065
SHE DECIDED TO TURN
HER CAKE SHOP

11:05.065 --> 11:07.097
INTO AN ADULT-THEMED
ESTABLISHMENT.

11:07.097 --> 11:10.200
SO I DECIDED TO MIX UP
MY BUSINESS A LITTLE BIT.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.671
WHAT'S THE HARM IN THAT?

11:11.671 --> 11:12.943
(chuckles) I'LL TELL YOU.

11:12.943 --> 11:14.775
IT WAS NINE YEARS AGO.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.446
I WANTED TO REACH SOME
NEW CUSTOMERS,

11:16.446 --> 11:18.809
SO I GOT ONE OF THOSE
MONDAY NIGHT SOCCER CHANNELS.

11:18.809 --> 11:21.051
IT WORKED. (chuckles)
PLACE WAS PACKED...

11:21.051 --> 11:23.854
UNTIL THE HOOLIGANS
TOOK OVER.

11:23.854 --> 11:26.817
YEAH, I HAD TO CHANGE THE NAME
OF MY FRENCH FRIES TO "CHIPS."

11:26.817 --> 11:28.458
I ORDERED FIRE EXTINGUISHERS

11:28.458 --> 11:30.420
IN BULK TO PUT OUT
TRASH CAN FIRES.

11:30.420 --> 11:34.064
I WAS HEADBUTTED
ON SIX DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.

11:34.064 --> 11:36.126
SOMETIMES WHEN I CLOSE
MY EYES,

11:36.126 --> 11:38.128
I CAN STILL HEAR THEM.

11:38.128 --> 11:40.030
в™Є OLГ©! в™Є

11:40.030 --> 11:42.232
в™Є OLГ©, OLГ©, OLГ© в™Є

11:42.232 --> 11:44.875
в™Є OLГ©! в™Є

11:44.875 --> 11:46.106
(softly) в™Є OLГ© в™Є

11:46.106 --> 11:47.707
I REMEMBER THAT.
DIDN'T THEY FLIP OVER

11:47.707 --> 11:49.079
A POLICE CAR
IN THE PLAZA?

11:49.079 --> 11:50.440
WITH THE POLICEMEN
STILL IN IT.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.312
I ENDED UP BRINGING IN
A FAMILY OF RATS

11:52.312 --> 11:54.945
TO HAVE MY OWN BAR SHUT DOWN
BY THE BOARD OF HEALTH.

11:54.945 --> 11:56.887
NOTHING LIKE THAT COULD
HAPPEN TO ME, COULD IT?

11:56.887 --> 11:59.850
WHOO! CAKE SLUT.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.291
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME

12:01.291 --> 12:03.723
I'VE BEEN CALLED "SLUT"
IN A BAD WAY.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.956
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, SIR.
I GOT IT ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

12:05.956 --> 12:07.397
(mouths words)

12:07.397 --> 12:11.131
(indistinct conversations)

12:11.131 --> 12:14.104
(amplified voice)
CITIZENS OF GULFHAVEN,

12:14.104 --> 12:16.837
THE MAYOR HAS ASKED ME
TO GET UP HERE

12:16.837 --> 12:18.969
AND TELL YOU THAT
THE WATER'S SAFE

12:18.969 --> 12:22.342
AND THAT THERE IS NO
GIANT KILLER JELLYFISH.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.944
(crowd murmuring)

12:23.944 --> 12:26.847
(loudly)
THE MAYOR'S A LIAR!

12:26.847 --> 12:29.780
THE GIANT KILLER JELLYFISH
IS OUT FOR BLOOD!

12:29.780 --> 12:31.952
IT'S A MAN-EATER,
AND OPENING UP THE BEACHES

12:31.952 --> 12:33.753
IS LIKE RINGING
A DINNER BELL.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.186
(crowd murmuring)

12:36.186 --> 12:39.329
WHY IS HE RUNNING?
WE'RE ON LAND.

12:39.329 --> 12:41.091
BOBBY, WHAT DID YOU
JUST DO?

12:41.091 --> 12:42.963
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

12:42.963 --> 12:45.195
I'M NOT EXACTLY
GROUNDED IN REALITY.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.200
THESE PEOPLE ARE
THE WORST.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.402
AW. YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BE

12:52.402 --> 12:53.904
CHARMING ELLIE
JUST IN CASE

12:53.904 --> 12:55.445
THERE'S ANYONE
IMPORTANT AROUND.

12:55.445 --> 12:58.508
OH, LIKE THE FALLING DOWN
DRUNK WITH THE EYE PATCH?

12:58.508 --> 13:00.981
I WISH I HAD TWO
EYE PATCHES.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.212
YEAH, BUT YOU JUST
NEVER KNOW.

13:02.212 --> 13:03.884
I MEAN, SEE THAT COUPLE
RIGHT THERE?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.956
THEY COULD BE MEMBERS
OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

13:05.956 --> 13:09.219
SOCIALITES TEND NOT TO RUN
THE BASES IN PUBLIC.

13:09.219 --> 13:10.861
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
THEY WANT YOU TO THINK,

13:10.861 --> 13:12.222
WHICH IS WHY
THEY'RE UNDERCOVER.

13:12.222 --> 13:14.194
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BE
CHARMING JUST IN CASE.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.425
BU-BU-BU-BAH.

13:15.425 --> 13:17.297
WHY DO YOU KEEP TRYING
TO GET ME

13:17.297 --> 13:19.329
TO BE NICE TO STRANGERS?

13:19.329 --> 13:21.201
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.803
YOU LIKE CHARMING ELLIE,
DON'T YOU?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.806
WHAT?
(scoffs) THAT'S CRAZY.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.339
OH, ARE YOU JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE YOU WANNA BE CHELLIE?

13:29.339 --> 13:31.241
'CAUSE I WOULD TOTALLY
SUPPORT THAT.

13:31.241 --> 13:33.583
YOU HAVE A NAME FOR IT?!
OH, MY GOD.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.415
YOU LIKE CHARMING ELLIE
MORE THAN ME.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.017
OH, HONEY,
OF COURSE NOT.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.149
I LOVE YOU MORE
THAN ANYTHING, CHELLIE.

13:39.149 --> 13:41.551
WAIT, DID I SAY "ELLIE"
OR "CHELLIE"?

13:41.551 --> 13:44.895
WOW. SO MY BEST FRIEND
WOULD RATHER BE FRIENDS

13:44.895 --> 13:47.157
WITH A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

13:47.157 --> 13:48.929
THANKS, JULES.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.261
OH, ELLIE, COME ON.
I'M SO SORRY.

13:51.261 --> 13:53.103
ELLIE!

13:53.103 --> 13:55.465
ARGH!

13:58.138 --> 13:59.369
ELLIE, I DIDN'T MEAN
I WANT YOU TO CHANGE.

13:59.369 --> 14:01.211
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.

14:01.211 --> 14:02.913
I'M NOT MAD. IT'S FINE.

14:02.913 --> 14:04.414
YOU LIKE CHELLIE BETTER.

14:04.414 --> 14:06.846
MAYBE I'LL BE CHELLIE
ALL THE TIME.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.019
YOUR TOP
IS REALLY FLATTERING.

14:09.019 --> 14:10.580
THANK YOU?

14:10.580 --> 14:12.923
YOU'RE A PLEASURE
TO BE AROUND.

14:12.923 --> 14:14.424
YOU KNOW, YOUR WORDS
ARE NICE,

14:14.424 --> 14:16.957
BUT YOUR VOICE
IS MEAN.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.489
COMPLIMENTS AREN'T
SUPPOSED TO HURT!

14:20.991 --> 14:23.533
HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:23.533 --> 14:25.936
I NEEDED SOME NEW BUSINESS,
AND I GOT SOME, OKAY?

14:25.936 --> 14:29.069
I'M SHOCKED...
AND SLIGHTLY TURNED ON.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.570
NUMBER 12!

14:30.570 --> 14:32.072
OH, LET ME GUESS.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.104
YOU HANG OUT HERE
ALL THE TIME NOW.

14:34.104 --> 14:36.546
NOT ALL THE TIME.
I DO HAVE A JOB.

14:36.546 --> 14:38.348
I JUST... CALLED IN SICK.

14:38.348 --> 14:40.180
HEY, CAN I AMEND
MY OTHER ORDER?

14:40.180 --> 14:43.253
I WANNA UPGRADE FROM BIG
TO BA-DONKA-DONK.

14:43.253 --> 14:44.915
OH, HI.

14:44.915 --> 14:48.018
MY KOOKY HUSBAND LOVED
THE IDEA OF THE PREGNANT CAKE.

14:48.018 --> 14:50.290
BUT HE WANTS TO TAKE IT
UP A NOTCH.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.561
SO COULD WE JUST, UM...

14:51.561 --> 14:55.365
WHAT?
(whispering indistinctly)

14:55.365 --> 14:57.497
THAT'S INSANE!

14:57.497 --> 14:59.599
WELL, THE OTHER WOMAN
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BLACK.

14:59.599 --> 15:04.034
THAT'S IT. I WANT ALL
CREEPY WEIRDOS OUT MY SHOP.

15:04.034 --> 15:05.535
YOU HEARD THE LADY!

15:09.279 --> 15:12.912
WELL, I JUST KICKED A BUNCH
OF PAYING CUSTOMERS

15:12.912 --> 15:15.485
OUT OF MY SHOP,
AND NOW IT IS EMPTY AGAIN.

15:15.485 --> 15:18.618
TRUE, BUT YOU CHOSE INTEGRITY
OVER COMPROMISING YOUR VISION.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.251
AND THAT'S GOTTA FEEL GOOD,
RIGHT?

15:21.251 --> 15:23.093
(exhales deeply)

15:23.093 --> 15:25.125
(all shouting over each other)

15:25.125 --> 15:26.356
MR. MAYOR!

15:26.356 --> 15:28.028
YOU NEED TO CLOSE
THE BEACHES.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.930
MY CHILDREN SWIM THERE.
MY CHILDREN!

15:30.930 --> 15:32.462
AND I LOVE CHILDREN, MISS, BUT--

15:32.462 --> 15:34.064
LOOK, IF WE CLOSE
THE BEACHES,

15:34.064 --> 15:35.405
THEN ALL
THESE TOURISTS LEAVE.

15:35.405 --> 15:36.606
AND NOT TO SOUND COLD,

15:36.606 --> 15:38.108
BUT I'VE BEEN CLEANING UP
THIS WEEK.

15:38.108 --> 15:40.410
DOWN WITH BIG BUSINESS!

15:40.410 --> 15:44.144
SAY "NO" TO THE LIES!
(crowd booing)

15:44.144 --> 15:46.346
LET'S HEAR FROM
THE BRILLIANT ROGER FRANK.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.947
OH, WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.681
I SAY THE BEACHES STAY OPEN,
HOO-ZAH!

15:51.681 --> 15:54.384
(crowd) YEAH! YEAH!

15:54.384 --> 15:56.226
YOU! YOU'RE A TROUBLEMAKER!

15:56.226 --> 15:59.289
(scratching)
(crowd groans)

16:00.630 --> 16:03.493
YOU ALL KNOW ME,

16:03.493 --> 16:06.236
KNOW WHAT I DO FOR A LIVIN'.

16:06.236 --> 16:09.239
IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.
I CAN'T PLEASE ALL OF YOU.

16:09.239 --> 16:11.401
TOO MANY CAPTAINS
IN THIS TOWN.

16:11.401 --> 16:13.573
BUT ONLY ONE IS
MY BEST FRIEND,

16:13.573 --> 16:15.175
SO IF BOBBY COBB SAID HE SAW

16:15.175 --> 16:17.107
A GIANT KILLER JELLYFISH,
THEN HE SAW IT.

16:17.107 --> 16:20.010
THE HEAD, THE TAIL,

16:20.010 --> 16:21.581
THE WHOLE DAMN THING.

16:23.053 --> 16:24.984
THE BEACHES ARE CLOSED.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.756
I'M GOING HOME,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

16:26.756 --> 16:28.618
(crowd booing)
GO, GO!

16:28.618 --> 16:31.361
(woman) YEAH!
WOO-HOO!
WA-WA--WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

16:31.361 --> 16:34.664
I DO EXAGGERATE
A LITTLE BIT SOMETIMES,

16:34.664 --> 16:36.496
BUT MY BEST FRIEND
IS LEGIT.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.999
AND IF MAYOR TORRES SAYS
THE BEACHES ARE SAFE,

16:39.999 --> 16:42.202
THEN THEY'RE SAFE.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.474
AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT.

16:44.474 --> 16:46.206
(Andy) NOT BY YOURSELF,
YOU'RE NOT.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.182
(both groan)

16:52.182 --> 16:53.643
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

16:53.643 --> 16:56.086
WE'RE... GOING IN THE WATER

16:56.086 --> 16:58.048
TO SEE IF... IT'S SAFE.

16:58.048 --> 17:00.350
WAS THAT NOT... CLEAR?

17:00.350 --> 17:03.423
I NEED TO MOVE
TO A NEW TOWN.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.095
I DON'T MEAN IT IN
A BAD WAY.

17:05.095 --> 17:07.457
I JUST THINK THEY'LL BE
HAPPIER BACK HOME.

17:07.457 --> 17:08.698
OF COURSE.

17:08.698 --> 17:10.600
MY SON IS HALF CUBAN,

17:10.600 --> 17:12.202
BUT I TOTALLY SEE
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

17:12.202 --> 17:13.563
(chuckles) OH, ELLIE.

17:13.563 --> 17:15.505
YOUR CHARM MORE THAN
MAKES UP FOR THE FACT

17:15.505 --> 17:17.407
THAT YOU DRESS LIKE
A TEENAGE BOY.

17:17.407 --> 17:19.109
I SURE DO, BEV.

17:19.109 --> 17:21.171
OH, YOU! (chuckles)
(women laugh)

17:21.171 --> 17:23.343
UH, CAN YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A SECOND?

17:23.343 --> 17:26.076
NO, I'M LAUGHING.
I WANNA TALK TO YOU.
OKAY, THANKS.

17:27.777 --> 17:29.679
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

17:29.679 --> 17:31.321
I'M BEING CHELLIE.

17:31.321 --> 17:33.623
'CAUSE SHE'S SO FUN
AND CHARMING TO BE AROUND.

17:33.623 --> 17:36.526
SHE IS, BUT THIS ISN'T
WHAT I WANTED.

17:36.526 --> 17:37.827
COME ON. YOU KNOW ME!

17:37.827 --> 17:39.759
I FALL IN LOVE
WITH NEW THINGS.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.691
REMEMBER THAT PSYCHIC PHASE
I WENT THROUGH?

17:41.691 --> 17:44.694
I HAD THAT CRYSTAL BALL,
AND BOBBY WENT BOWLING WITH IT?

17:44.694 --> 17:46.836
NEW THINGS COME AND GO.

17:46.836 --> 17:49.599
I JUST DON'T REALIZE HOW
BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT

17:49.599 --> 17:51.701
THE OLD THING WAS
UNTIL IT'S GONE.

17:51.701 --> 17:54.804
YOU MISS AND DESPERATELY
LOVE ELLIE?

17:54.804 --> 17:56.306
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

17:56.306 --> 17:58.178
I'M SO SORRY, HONEY.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.110
IT'S OKAY.

18:00.110 --> 18:04.154
JUST THAT BEING NICE
HURTS ME TO MY CORE.

18:04.154 --> 18:05.515
UNLESS I'M BEING NICE
TO YOU.

18:05.515 --> 18:07.117
WAIT, DOES THAT MEAN
I GET TO HAVE ELLIE BACK

18:07.117 --> 18:09.189
BUT ALSO JUST
A LITTLE SIDE OF CHELLIE?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.720
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.

18:10.720 --> 18:14.594
FIRST, I HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF A LITTLE... SOMETHING.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.368
YOU'RE GONNA GO DESTROY
THOSE WOMEN, AREN'T YOU?

18:18.368 --> 18:20.730
BEAUTIFUL BITCH IS BACK.

18:22.232 --> 18:24.234
EXCUSE ME.

18:24.234 --> 18:25.705
HOW ARE YOU AT
MAKING BALLS?

18:25.705 --> 18:27.237
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

18:27.237 --> 18:29.108
COME ON, YOUR KID
IS RIGHT HERE.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.612
YES, AND SHE LOVES SOCCER,
SO FOR HER BIRTHDAY...
OH! (laughs)

18:32.612 --> 18:34.184
WE WERE HOPING...
MY MISTAKE.

18:34.184 --> 18:36.786
YES. NO, I'M--I'M SO SORRY.
OF COURSE, YEAH.

18:36.786 --> 18:38.218
I CAN MAKE SOCCER BALLS.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.749
WOW.

18:39.749 --> 18:41.651
OH! UH...

18:41.651 --> 18:43.553
DO YOU KNOW...

18:43.553 --> 18:46.156
THAT THIS BUTTERFLY CAKE

18:46.156 --> 18:49.459
IS THE FIRST KIND OF CAKE
THAT I EVER LEARNED HOW TO MAKE?

18:49.459 --> 18:50.800
DO YOU LIKE IT?

18:50.800 --> 18:53.303
IT'S SO PRETTY.
CAN I HAVE IT?

18:53.303 --> 18:55.505
WELL, THEN. I-I GUESS
WE'LL TAKE THE BUTTERFLY.

18:58.668 --> 19:01.241
CAN I OFFER
A MORE SENSIBLE SOLUTION?

19:01.241 --> 19:03.713
CALL A PROFESSIONAL,
SEE IF THE WATER'S SAFE.

19:03.713 --> 19:05.375
WE DON'T NEED
A PROFESSIONAL.

19:05.375 --> 19:06.776
WE HAVE FRIENDSHIP.

19:06.776 --> 19:08.518
BEST FRIENDSHIP!
OH, GREAT.

19:08.518 --> 19:09.879
BECAUSE I READ
THAT FRIENDSHIP

19:09.879 --> 19:12.182
KEEPS AWAY JELLYFISH
AND SHARKS.

19:12.182 --> 19:14.554
SO YOU SHOULD BE ALL GOOD.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.785
AH, I DON'T SEE
ANY JELLYFISH.

19:15.785 --> 19:17.527
I THINK WE'RE SAFE.

19:17.527 --> 19:19.189
YEAH, I GUESS DARTH VADER
AND HIS STORMTROOPERS

19:19.189 --> 19:22.392
HEADED BACK TO THEIR
UNDERWATER DEATH ST--AAH!

19:22.392 --> 19:23.633
OH!
(laughs)

19:23.633 --> 19:24.864
DID YOU JUST SAY
"DEATH STAH"

19:24.864 --> 19:26.696
LIKE YOU'RE FROM
NEW JERSEY--AAH!

19:26.696 --> 19:29.239
OH, MAN. IT'S ABOUT TO
GET BAD, ISN'T IT?

19:29.239 --> 19:30.540
YES, IT IS.

19:30.540 --> 19:32.802
WELL, AT LEAST
WE'RE TOGETHER--AAH!

19:32.802 --> 19:34.644
OH, MAN,
THEY'RE EVERY--AAH! AAH!

19:34.644 --> 19:37.407
AND IT LOOKS LIKE FRIENDSHIP
DOES NOT KEEP JELLYFISH AWAY.

19:37.407 --> 19:38.678
(Bobby and Andy) OOH! OW!

19:40.750 --> 19:42.912
WEAK POUR, DIME EYES.

19:42.912 --> 19:45.815
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM,
SOME SLUTTY TOURIST IN A CORSET?

19:45.815 --> 19:47.417
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:47.417 --> 19:49.589
YOU LOOK SO GORGEOUS.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.391
I WISH I COULD
STARE AT YOU FOREVER.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.963
I GET THE BEST
OF BOTH ELLIES.

19:53.963 --> 19:55.495
THIS IS PERFECT.
(door closes in distance)

19:55.495 --> 19:56.866
NOT FOR ME.
NOBODY CARES.

19:56.866 --> 19:59.569
HEY. WHO WANTS TO
DIVE INTO A TRAY

19:59.569 --> 20:01.371
OF LEFTOVER EROTIC
CAKE PARTS?
(sets down plate)

20:01.371 --> 20:03.503
DUH, BRING IT.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.305
OOH.

20:05.305 --> 20:08.608
I FRANKENSTEINED ALL THE UNUSED
BOOBS, BUTTS, AND LIMBS

20:08.608 --> 20:11.511
INTO ONE GIANT EROTIC CAKE
SUPER FREAK.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.814
IT'S LIKE OUT OF ONE OF
THOSE JAPANESE ANIME PORNOS.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.446
(laughing) I'M GUESSING.

20:16.446 --> 20:19.319
I MEAN, HOW WOULD I KNOW
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

20:19.319 --> 20:22.552
HEY, DOES IT MAKE ME GAY
IF I EAT THIS?

20:22.552 --> 20:24.254
I THINK IT DOES.

20:24.254 --> 20:25.695
I'M DOING IT ANYWAY.

20:25.695 --> 20:28.728
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO--
DO YOU WANT A FORK?

20:30.800 --> 20:32.702
STILL SORE FROM THOSE
STINGS?

20:32.702 --> 20:35.335
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT
MAKE US FEEL BETTER?

20:35.335 --> 20:36.606
HMM?

20:36.606 --> 20:41.371
в™Є OLГ©, OLГ©, OLГ©, OLГ© в™Є

20:41.371 --> 20:44.274

20:44.274 --> 20:45.545
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
SORRY. GET OUT OF HERE.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.776
NOT THAT KIND OF BAR.

20:46.776 --> 20:49.749
MNH-MNH. GO ON.
SORRY, FELLAS.

20:49.749 --> 20:54.454
(quietly)
в™Є OLГ©, OLГ©, OLГ©, OLГ© в™Є

20:54.454 --> 20:57.787
