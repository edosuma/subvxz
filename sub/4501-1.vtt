02:08.255 --> 02:10.601
I'll try anything once, me,

02:10.687 --> 02:12.600
except bestiality.

02:12.687 --> 02:14.642
And maybe Morris dancing.

02:14.685 --> 02:16.598
Yeah, I'll try
and give them aswerve.

02:16.684 --> 02:20.117
Now round here where I live,
everyone's heard of Jason Locke.

02:20.203 --> 02:24.071
He'd just done a five stretch for armed
robbery. Been outless than 24 hours.

02:24.158 --> 02:26.809
Mr. D. had asked me
to drive him about for a few days,

02:26.896 --> 02:28.807
so I said, "Yeah, sure."

03:20.732 --> 03:22.644
We pick up this van, and Jason says...

03:22.688 --> 03:26.077
he wants to look up an old friend
who he knew from before.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.103
You squealin' git!
You fucker!

03:56.232 --> 03:59.273
You want some, huh?
Yeah, you cunt!

03:59.317 --> 04:01.621
Please, no more!

04:03.315 --> 04:06.139
Fucking grass!
Come here!

04:09.571 --> 04:11.484
Leave him alone!

04:18.305 --> 04:20.522
You fucking grass!

04:23.563 --> 04:27.040
This is what you get.

04:27.126 --> 04:29.777
Fuckin' grass!

04:31.645 --> 04:34.426
Get in there!

04:42.508 --> 04:45.550
Oh, my face!

04:45.636 --> 04:47.592
Shit.

04:47.635 --> 04:51.807
My face is burning up!

05:26.047 --> 05:28.046
Come on.
Let's go home.

05:28.132 --> 05:31.131
And that was that.Job done.

05:31.217 --> 05:35.085
Jason needed a new shirt.
The geezer needed a new face.

05:50.076 --> 05:53.942
Next, I take him to his mate's place,

05:54.030 --> 05:55.985
which he's been hearing
things about.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.229
Fucking bastards.

06:40.175 --> 06:42.087
Lisa?

06:44.564 --> 06:48.561
I've seen his house.
He's taking the piss.

06:48.605 --> 06:50.560
Nice, isn't it?

06:51.733 --> 06:53.732
Oh, yeah. How'd he get
that sort of dough?

06:53.819 --> 06:55.731
How'd he stay
out of prison?

07:00.163 --> 07:04.465
- You want egg with this?
- No. Yeah, go on.

07:04.551 --> 07:07.593
- Would you like anything?
- No, I'm all right. Ta.

07:09.592 --> 07:11.547
He had a Porsche
and a Bentley, the bastard.

07:11.591 --> 07:14.328
What, a Porsche now?
That must be new.

07:16.587 --> 07:19.673
- What about Wayne?
- Oh, he's got a five-series BMW...

07:19.717 --> 07:22.193
and a nice little three-bedroom house
in Billericay.

07:33.403 --> 07:36.923
It was a fucking mansion...
great big drive, electric gates,

07:37.010 --> 07:39.660
fucking statues of lions
on the gate posts.

07:39.704 --> 07:43.137
- You could have told me.
- What, spoil the surprise?

07:43.180 --> 07:45.830
Anyway, so look, I'm thinking,
"It's been a really interesting morning.

07:45.918 --> 07:48.350
Thanks very much.
If it's all the same to you..."

07:48.394 --> 07:50.654
- And then he says,
- Gonna need you some more, Billy.

07:50.698 --> 07:52.957
- All right? Later on.
- And I say...

07:53.044 --> 07:56.476
- Yeah, sure.
- And that's it. I've got the job.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.692
Your girlfriend won't mind,
will she, Billy?

07:58.822 --> 08:00.735
You have got a girlfriend,
haven'tyou?

08:00.778 --> 08:03.516
Yeah, I got a girlfriend.
She won't mind.

08:03.602 --> 08:05.862
Liar.

08:18.463 --> 08:20.548
One-nine. Yes, that's right.

08:20.592 --> 08:22.547
Mrs. Knight for Brentwood.

08:22.634 --> 08:26.284
Yeah, one-nine. Yeah, on my way.

08:26.371 --> 08:30.194
- The geezer grassed him up.
What else could he do?
- Oh, yeah?

08:30.282 --> 08:33.366
I ain't sayin' he should have gone
that far, but you know how it is.

08:33.453 --> 08:36.842
Oh, he just sounds
like an animal to me.

08:36.885 --> 08:40.188
They should put him back inside,
do us all a favor.

08:40.275 --> 08:42.578
He's just done a five-year stretch
'cause of this mug.

08:42.621 --> 08:45.185
- I'd have done exactly the same thing.
- That's you, is it, Billy?

08:45.229 --> 08:47.140
You could do that
to someone?

08:47.228 --> 08:49.400
In principle.

08:53.137 --> 08:55.962
Billy, don't get involved
with this bloke.

09:11.952 --> 09:15.384
See him, Peter, oh, he's the top boy.
He runs the show.

09:15.471 --> 09:18.513
Him, Wayne, does whatever
Peter tells him.

09:18.600 --> 09:23.466
And Jason... Well, every firm needs
a mad acidbath murderer, don't they?

09:24.727 --> 09:26.682
What do you think
of my hair, Billy?

09:26.769 --> 09:28.681
- You look like a fuckin' poof.
- Fuck off!

09:28.724 --> 09:31.244
What?

09:31.288 --> 09:33.547
Fuck of, will ya?

09:35.460 --> 09:37.545
It's all right, isn't it?

09:37.588 --> 09:42.281
It looks really,
really fucking stupid.

09:57.707 --> 10:00.530
Can't you go any faster, Billy?
I'm racing in the back here.

10:00.618 --> 10:03.138
I thought you were supposed
to be Billy fuckin' Whizz.

10:05.701 --> 10:10.786
It's all come from the doors.
You run the doors, and you
control what get inside.

10:10.872 --> 10:14.132
Clubs don't give a shit.
Just don't want any aggro.

10:14.218 --> 10:18.042
Most weeks now, we're...
turning over 20 grand.

10:18.128 --> 10:20.475
- Yeah?
- Mm.

10:20.518 --> 10:23.387
Fucking hell.

10:23.429 --> 10:25.777
We, uh, do a bit of weed
in the week maybe,

10:25.863 --> 10:28.644
but pills is where
the money's really at.

10:28.688 --> 10:30.599
I keep away from them
when they're on them.

10:30.687 --> 10:34.336
Fucking eyes all go wonky, don't they?
He's done 'em, soppy nuts.

10:34.380 --> 10:37.161
I won't touch 'em meself.

10:37.247 --> 10:40.289
They're not for you, Jase.
They make you wanna love everyone.

10:40.376 --> 10:43.505
I love you!

10:56.409 --> 10:59.104
Pull in here, Billy Whizz.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.835
What's happened to the Honeycomb?

11:10.879 --> 11:14.007
Half a million on a refit,
and it's now called Blondz.

11:14.051 --> 11:16.658
- Packed every night of the week.
- Is it still ours?

11:16.745 --> 11:19.743
No. They gave it
to that prick, Perry Elley.

11:19.787 --> 11:21.742
Perry fucking Elley?

11:21.786 --> 11:23.741
Yeah. It's him and us now, Jase.

11:23.785 --> 11:25.740
That fucking wanker.

11:25.826 --> 11:27.739
He was knocking out
dodgy Sierras.

11:27.781 --> 11:31.171
Yeah, well, he's moved in
on the doors now, like us,

11:31.214 --> 11:33.170
'cause that's
where the money is.

11:33.213 --> 11:36.863
Every door he gets is one
we could be making money from.
You know what I'm saying, Jase?

11:42.121 --> 11:44.076
Billy.

11:44.119 --> 11:47.031
I want you to pull up outside
in exactly five minutes, yeah?

11:47.031 --> 11:49.334
- Sure.
- Don't fuck about.

11:49.421 --> 11:53.505
You make sure
you're right outside.

12:55.554 --> 12:57.422
You all right, Nic?

12:57.510 --> 13:01.768
All right, listen, darling,
I don't think I'm gonna be
back till about midnight.

13:01.898 --> 13:04.201
Yeah. No, it's nothing
like that.

13:04.288 --> 13:07.156
No, I'm just waiting
for 'em outside Blondz in Southend.

13:07.199 --> 13:10.023
You know, the one
with the glass.

13:10.111 --> 13:13.499
Nic, I gotta go.

13:13.586 --> 13:15.759
Bloody hell, they've
thrown him from the bloody window.

13:26.666 --> 13:30.185
Leave him!

13:30.271 --> 13:32.270
Fuckin' leave him!

13:41.092 --> 13:43.524
Go forward!

13:43.612 --> 13:46.827
Go forward and run the bastard over!
We ain't got time to fuck up about.

14:10.595 --> 14:12.029
Careful, Billy Whizz.

14:17.765 --> 14:20.155
Fucking amateur!

14:20.241 --> 14:22.675
Shit!

14:22.761 --> 14:24.760
Oh, God!

14:44.401 --> 14:47.312
Get down.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.433
You are fucking Billy Whizz.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.780
Yeah. Let's move.

15:31.893 --> 15:34.500
Well done, Billy Whizz.
You did all right.

15:34.544 --> 15:36.499
Yeah, nice one, Billy.

15:37.759 --> 15:40.062
What do you think
of the barnet, Billy?

15:40.105 --> 15:42.539
- It's all right, isn't it?
- Yeah, it looks all right.

15:42.582 --> 15:44.537
See, I told you.

15:44.625 --> 15:47.318
And this boy knows
what he's talking about.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.361
Mm, pair of fucking poofs.

16:36.289 --> 16:38.852
Nicole. Nicole.

16:50.324 --> 16:54.494
Oi, look. Ta-da.

16:54.625 --> 16:57.971
Ta-da!

16:58.015 --> 17:01.012
You said you was going to be back
at 12:00, Billy.

17:01.099 --> 17:03.533
I know. I'm sorry.

17:03.619 --> 17:06.444
I've had a right result, though.
Look at that, 500 quid.

17:06.488 --> 17:08.747
That's for one night's work.

17:12.396 --> 17:14.700
- Where are you going?
- I needa wee.

17:19.435 --> 17:21.391
So, what happened?

17:21.435 --> 17:23.867
Well, it just seemed to go on,
and I couldn't get away.

17:23.954 --> 17:27.214
If I'd known you was going
to be out all night, I wouldn't
have bothered coming around.

17:27.344 --> 17:30.603
- I'm sorry.
- I've got to pick up Candice
in a couple of hours.

17:30.646 --> 17:32.775
Yeah, but that's 500 quid.
It's not bad, is it?

17:32.906 --> 17:36.556
That's just for driving them
about. And I tell you what,
they're well pleased with me.

17:36.599 --> 17:40.727
All of a sudden,
I have just become Billy Whizz.

17:40.814 --> 17:44.595
It's like Billy Whizz this
and Billy Whizz that.

17:44.681 --> 17:46.810
- Better than cabbing, isn't it?
- o you mind?

17:46.854 --> 17:48.809
Sorry.

17:48.896 --> 17:51.373
They'll want me again tomorrow.

17:51.460 --> 17:54.675
Thank you very much.

17:54.762 --> 17:56.674
Come on, get into bed.

17:56.717 --> 18:00.801
Warm me up.
Make yourself useful.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.228
The following night, I'm out with them again.

18:14.272 --> 18:16.444
Pete Chaseruns the security
at Dantes,

18:16.532 --> 18:19.138
which means I don't have to queue up
with all the other mugs,

18:19.225 --> 18:21.224
which is nice.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.396
Billy Whizz, come on, son.
You're with the A-team now.

18:43.124 --> 18:45.079
Who's he, Billy?

18:45.166 --> 18:47.643
Oh, my God, that's Jason Locke,
isn't it?

18:47.730 --> 18:49.685
He's just come out.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.379
did she?

18:52.466 --> 18:55.681
It's a simple question,
and I want an answer.

18:56.768 --> 19:00.374
Why'd you have to ask me?

19:00.461 --> 19:02.416
It's insulting.

19:02.416 --> 19:05.285
No is the answer.
Absolutely not. No.

19:05.371 --> 19:07.326
did you see her
spending time with anyone?

19:07.370 --> 19:09.630
Come on, Jase.
I just told you.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.497
That I know of,
she didn't mess around.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.800
What do you mean,
"that you know of"?

19:26.532 --> 19:29.357
Hey, Billy Whizz,
come over here.

19:29.399 --> 19:31.355
Stay there.

19:35.266 --> 19:37.221
How you doing, Billy?

19:37.308 --> 19:39.871
- Not too bad, Mr. Chase.
- Call me, Peter.

19:46.954 --> 19:48.866
- All right?
- Are you Jason?

19:48.953 --> 19:51.082
Yeah.

19:51.169 --> 19:54.080
What you gonna do when you've finished
with Jason, go back to cabbing?

19:54.167 --> 19:56.340
Er, yeah. I mean, I thought
I might do the knowledge.

19:56.426 --> 19:59.642
- You know what I mean, do it properly.
- That's a hard game, that.

19:59.729 --> 20:03.466
All them fuckin' tests. Sloggin'
about onmopeds. Goodluck to you, boy.

20:03.553 --> 20:05.769
Well, you've gotta
do something, ain't ya?

20:05.856 --> 20:08.550
I don't like to see anybody
work when they don't have to.

20:08.637 --> 20:11.070
And you're
a bright bloke, Billy.

20:11.157 --> 20:14.894
We've been very impressed
with you. Very impressed.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.588
We'd like to make you
an offer.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.542
How about when you finish driving Jason
around, you don't go back to cabbing?

20:20.586 --> 20:23.758
How about you stay
driving for us?

20:23.844 --> 20:27.451
- What, you mean...
- I mean, you work full-time for us.

20:28.798 --> 20:31.405
What's the matter, Billy?

20:31.493 --> 20:34.360
You saw a few things last night,
Billy, but, er, well...

20:34.404 --> 20:36.359
in my book...
makes you one of the boys.

20:40.009 --> 20:43.920
Yeah, but you know I'd never
say nothing about last night, don't ya?

20:44.006 --> 20:48.916
Oh, yeah. I know that, Billy.
I know I can trust you.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.871
It was either that, Billy,
or we stick a knife in ya.

20:53.913 --> 20:57.476
Bing.

21:00.431 --> 21:03.473
did you speak to Peter
about the business?

21:03.559 --> 21:05.471
Pete's me mate.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.470
Yeah.

21:07.557 --> 21:11.381
You tell him you want to
be his partner, not his mate.

21:11.424 --> 21:13.379
He'll sort me out,
all right.

21:13.467 --> 21:15.813
Look. I know how they work.
I've been watching them.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.812
There's too many people
in the chain.

21:17.855 --> 21:19.811
What fucking chain?
What are you on about?

21:19.897 --> 21:23.069
Jason!

21:23.200 --> 21:26.415
Anyway...

21:26.502 --> 21:28.457
he's given me
some spending money.

21:30.586 --> 21:32.673
It's in me pocket.

21:42.058 --> 21:44.534
It's five grand.

21:46.447 --> 21:49.445
A thousand a year...
that's all you're worth to him.

21:53.442 --> 21:56.918
That's just for starters.

21:57.048 --> 22:00.308
Anyway, what was I supposed to do,
grass them up like Chippy?

22:00.394 --> 22:03.132
Oh, no, he knewy ou wouldn't
do that. You were a sure thing.

22:03.175 --> 22:06.608
Yeah?And what about you?
You're asure thing.

22:06.651 --> 22:08.737
Yeah, I'm a sure thing.

22:08.781 --> 22:11.301
Yeah? Well, you waited
for me, did ya?

22:11.345 --> 22:13.647
All that time for five years,
did ya?

22:13.733 --> 22:15.863
didn't let anyone inside your knickers
while I was away?

22:15.950 --> 22:17.601
What's brought this on?

22:17.688 --> 22:19.904
Wh-Why didn't you
just say no?

22:19.991 --> 22:22.990
Why did you have to fuck about
being clever?

22:23.032 --> 22:25.771
Why didn't you just say no?

22:25.857 --> 22:27.768
Because I was at it
all the time.

22:27.856 --> 22:31.810
I had so much cock I started
a cock factory... big, fat, small, short.

22:31.896 --> 22:34.895
- Anyone bought me a drink,
I fucked them in our bed.
- Shut up!

22:34.982 --> 22:37.067
- Shut up!
- Just for the price ofa drink!

22:37.111 --> 22:39.240
Shut up! Shut your fucking mouth!

22:39.327 --> 22:41.456
Shut up!
Fucking shut up!

22:46.019 --> 22:50.016
Why do you have to ask me?

22:52.536 --> 22:55.317
Because I'm a jealous fucking bastard,
and I don't trust you.

22:59.358 --> 23:01.965
I'm sorry.

23:02.095 --> 23:05.658
If I was gonna mess about,
I'd have done it a long time ago.

23:05.746 --> 23:08.527
Yeah, I know.

23:08.570 --> 23:10.786
Jason.

23:10.829 --> 23:13.740
I waited for you
because I believe in you.

23:15.870 --> 23:20.780
I don't ever want handouts
from them again. We can't
go back to how it was before.

23:31.121 --> 23:33.164
You get in that bedroom.

23:35.945 --> 23:38.899
You get in that bedroom.

24:45.989 --> 24:47.944
I get a call from Mr. D.

24:48.074 --> 24:51.072
I mean, strictly speaking,
I'm still working for him.

24:51.116 --> 24:54.114
He's asked me to pick up Henry
and drive him to this place.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.808
I've never been there before,
some farm.

24:56.895 --> 24:59.763
I just thought probably not a good idea
to tell Jason and the others...

24:59.806 --> 25:02.805
about where I was going
that night.

25:37.956 --> 25:40.825
Old Henry Hobbs never said much.

25:40.911 --> 25:43.997
And when he did, hes till never said much.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.299
Switch.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.549
The pilotis Mr. D.

26:05.635 --> 26:07.548
Wow.

26:07.591 --> 26:12.067
Dropped it down sweet as you like,
just like he said he could.

26:12.153 --> 26:15.325
This is fucking fantastic.

26:15.369 --> 26:19.062
- Can touch down and be in the air
again in less than 30 seconds.
- Right.

26:19.149 --> 26:23.798
The other chap is Peter Chase's
big rival on the club scene,
the infamous Perry Elley.

26:23.885 --> 26:27.361
You just keep yourself wrapped in cotton
wool for awhile and we're home and dry.

26:27.491 --> 26:30.316
Mr. D. and Perry had been hatching
this one for months.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.315
This was the final
dress rehearsal.

26:32.402 --> 26:34.575
Boys, this is gonna work.

26:36.269 --> 26:39.094
So, John Dyke... Mr. D...

26:39.180 --> 26:41.093
he was the one
who got me into this.

26:41.179 --> 26:43.612
I was doing me cabbing,
and I picked him up one day.

26:43.699 --> 26:46.827
We had a little chat and got talking,
and he asked for me again.

26:46.915 --> 26:50.043
I used to deliver things for him,
packages, and drive a few people about.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.737
But I didn't ask any questions.
I think he liked that.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.513
What do you make of Jason?

27:04.556 --> 27:08.510
I wouldn't like to get on the wrong
side of him. He's an 18-carat nutter.

27:08.553 --> 27:11.160
- He's kept you busy.
- Yeah.

27:13.072 --> 27:16.940
Actually, um, him and his pals
have asked me to do a bit
of driving about for 'em.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.677
Well, full-time.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.676
How do you feel about that?

27:21.762 --> 27:23.675
I don't know.

27:23.761 --> 27:25.978
Thought, "Why not?"

27:26.108 --> 27:28.020
I mean, they're all right.
They look after me.

27:28.063 --> 27:31.018
I wouldn't mind seeing
where it'd take me.

27:31.105 --> 27:34.321
I can still do a bit of driving for you.
That's no ta problem, is it?

27:34.407 --> 27:37.144
Well, good luck to you, Billy.

27:37.232 --> 27:39.187
do you think
it's a bad idea?

27:41.098 --> 27:43.054
It's not for me to say.

28:06.735 --> 28:09.168
Now it's starting to get complicated.

28:09.212 --> 28:12.037
Straightaway, Peter Chase asked me
to do a little job for him.

28:12.123 --> 28:15.730
I drive 'em to this burger bar,
and they tell me to wait.

28:48.231 --> 28:51.100
Police, stop!

28:59.094 --> 29:01.050
Armed police!

29:01.137 --> 29:03.092
Sit.

29:04.135 --> 29:06.221
I just lost
200 fucking grand.

29:18.430 --> 29:20.647
How'd it go?

29:20.690 --> 29:22.646
A total disaster.

29:22.688 --> 29:26.556
Couriers got arrested.
We lost thegear.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.511
Pete lost his money.

29:30.380 --> 29:32.769
Couldn't have gone
much better really, could it?

29:36.115 --> 29:39.157
- Oh! Oh, God!
- Eh?

29:39.244 --> 29:41.199
- Are you gonna see him then, babe?
- Yeah.

29:41.286 --> 29:43.415
Oh!

29:43.546 --> 29:47.500
Now he owes you, you know that.
Now's the time to call in the debt.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.499
Yeah, I know.

30:07.444 --> 30:09.791
What was her name again,
that blond one at the club?

30:09.834 --> 30:11.658
- Suzy.
- Yeah.

30:12.745 --> 30:15.874
She had a beautiful
little arse.

30:15.961 --> 30:17.916
You get her number
for me, yeah?

30:18.003 --> 30:21.436
Either her arse or your arse,
Billy Whizz.

31:00.411 --> 31:02.367
Welcome back, Jason.

31:05.626 --> 31:07.537
You didn't tell me
you were rich, John.

31:07.625 --> 31:10.448
I'm not rich.

31:10.492 --> 31:13.403
Everybody's suddenly rich
while I'm inside.

31:21.094 --> 31:23.049
It's a nice place, John.

31:25.788 --> 31:29.002
Could easily get a swimming pool
in this garden. Yeah.

31:29.090 --> 31:31.871
Nice pool with a cover on it.

31:31.914 --> 31:34.564
Gym upstairs.

31:36.824 --> 31:39.127
I could handle that.

31:39.171 --> 31:41.387
I leave the garden to Henry.
That's his domain.

31:42.820 --> 31:45.601
- Cheers.
- Cheers, John.

31:47.730 --> 31:51.858
I'm very grateful for what
you did for me inside, Jason.

31:51.945 --> 31:54.465
That's all right.

31:54.552 --> 31:56.594
I was wondering whether
I could repay the favor.

31:56.725 --> 31:58.941
Is there anything
I can do for you?

32:00.288 --> 32:03.373
Well, if you're asking,
John, maybe there is.

32:03.460 --> 32:06.284
I've got some friends who need
some gear brought into the country.

32:06.328 --> 32:10.629
- Gear?
- Naughty gear, John.

32:12.542 --> 32:14.583
All right, Henry?

32:14.627 --> 32:16.799
How's it going?

32:16.843 --> 32:20.102
Been having a lot of trouble
with drainage.

32:20.189 --> 32:24.187
Clay soil round here.
Water lies on the surface.

32:24.273 --> 32:26.619
Heavy rain drowns
everything off.

32:26.707 --> 32:29.183
Yeah. Gutting when
that happens, isn't it?

32:31.356 --> 32:33.311
All right, come on.
Come on.

32:33.398 --> 32:38.613
The truth is I work just for
one person now, then only occasionally.

32:38.699 --> 32:41.219
Working outside that arrangement
would be too dangerous.

32:41.219 --> 32:43.174
And, you see, I...

32:43.262 --> 32:48.650
I simply cannot
go to prison again... ever.

32:48.693 --> 32:51.126
Well, you think
about it, John.

32:51.214 --> 32:53.169
See if you can't
get your head around it.

32:53.212 --> 32:56.167
See, the way I see it,

32:56.254 --> 33:00.120
people with special
relationships, like us;

33:00.208 --> 33:02.771
people who've got secrets,
like us...

33:02.901 --> 33:05.813
Yeah? Well,
we should stick together.

33:05.900 --> 33:08.160
Oh, yes, yes,
I agree with you, Jason.

33:08.246 --> 33:12.461
That's why I-I'd be, uh, I'd be happy
to help you out fi nancially,

33:12.505 --> 33:14.721
- until you get on your feet.
- Mm. No, no.

33:14.764 --> 33:18.109
I don't want your money.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.499
I'm looking to the future
now, John.

33:21.934 --> 33:25.323
I wanna go into
business with you.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.489
Welcome home, Jason.

33:37.533 --> 33:39.488
Thanks for keeping
your mouth shut.

33:39.575 --> 33:42.746
One or two of the boys have overdone
the sunbed tonight, but we're all here.

33:42.834 --> 33:44.745
And we're wondering
what's next.

33:44.833 --> 33:47.005
Come on.

33:59.650 --> 34:01.691
Look at this!
Look, look at this!

34:01.779 --> 34:03.951
Hello, leader.
How are you doing?

34:04.039 --> 34:07.993
Oi! Billy Whizz, drinks.
Tell Tommy to get the scotch.

34:08.123 --> 34:10.034
The good stuff,
the malt, all right?

34:10.078 --> 34:14.032
Oi, you little sods. Hey, come on,
this is not a toy. Off you get!

34:14.161 --> 34:17.072
Hey, Beverley. Beverley, would you
come and look after these sods?

34:17.161 --> 34:19.159
Jason Locke!

34:19.246 --> 34:23.286
Out from under lock and key at last.
Here he is! Yea!

34:25.286 --> 34:28.717
That's the color of the moon

34:28.806 --> 34:31.196
Secretin the rainbow

34:31.239 --> 34:33.194
Him, with Jason...

34:33.281 --> 34:36.149
that's his old mate,
Kiri Christos, the banker.

34:36.235 --> 34:39.451
Well, geezers couldn't very well
go to the NatWest, could they?

34:39.581 --> 34:41.494
So, they went to him.

34:50.402 --> 34:54.051
You are looking
just as beautiful as ever.

34:54.138 --> 34:56.094
- Oh!
- Beautiful!

34:56.137 --> 34:58.092
Oh, and fiery!

34:58.179 --> 35:00.960
Oh, yes, it's that
Peter Chase spouting off.

35:01.047 --> 35:03.089
Oh, my God, Kiri!

35:03.176 --> 35:06.478
Can you believe it? We're in
our thirties. I feel so ancient.

35:06.522 --> 35:08.998
If I looked as good as you,
it wouldn't bother me much.

35:09.085 --> 35:12.431
o you know how upsetting it is to have
hair coming out your nose and ears?

35:12.475 --> 35:15.342
That's what they should have told us
in biology, not how to cut up...

35:15.430 --> 35:17.385
What were they, locusts?

35:17.471 --> 35:20.252
You always did make me laugh.

35:23.250 --> 35:25.467
Jason says he wants to
go into business.

35:25.510 --> 35:27.422
Yeah, well,
isn't it about time he did?

35:27.509 --> 35:31.376
- Haven't they made enough money
off his back?
- So, he needs a banker.

35:31.420 --> 35:34.592
- But he's got a problem.
- What's that?

35:34.634 --> 35:38.024
- He's got no security.
- Okay. How's he get that?

35:38.111 --> 35:41.934
Well, he needs to put up
something against the loan.

35:41.978 --> 35:44.976
Something valuable.
Something I want.

35:46.671 --> 35:49.234
I didn't know Jason had
anything you wanted.

35:49.278 --> 35:52.233
Well, you haven't been paying much
attention all these years, have you?

35:57.447 --> 36:00.011
Kiri, um,

36:00.055 --> 36:02.010
would you just excuse me
a minute?

36:02.096 --> 36:04.009
It was just getting interesting.

36:15.654 --> 36:18.434
- All right?
- Who's that?

36:18.477 --> 36:20.997
don't know. I just said
hello to her tonight.

36:23.518 --> 36:26.516
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- I said, "Who is she?"

36:26.603 --> 36:28.602
don't know.Just some little bird
Billy's knocking off.

36:28.732 --> 36:30.645
Anyway, it went well
with Kiri.

36:30.731 --> 36:32.642
don't shame me, Jason.

36:35.988 --> 36:38.465
- Beverley, all right?
- Mm.

36:38.552 --> 36:40.899
- So, what you been up to then, Lisa?
- Oh, you know,

36:40.985 --> 36:42.984
getting beasted by Jason.

36:43.072 --> 36:46.330
When they've been inside for so long,
they want to do it up the arse.

36:46.417 --> 36:50.588
If that's what your mate's been
doing to you for five years,
it's bound to have an efect.

36:50.632 --> 36:52.587
- Anyway, what about you girls?
- Oh, yeah.

36:52.674 --> 36:55.281
I didn't tell you what Pete bought me
for Christmas, did I?

36:55.368 --> 36:58.931
A horse.
I've called him Toby.

36:59.018 --> 37:02.103
- Oh, he's mad, isn't he?
- Put him down then.

37:02.190 --> 37:04.146
And the horse.

37:04.189 --> 37:07.969
I'm trying to be nice to you, Lisa.
Oh, you've got a short memory, babe.

37:08.012 --> 37:11.141
Bit too quick to forget who's been
helping you while Jason's been inside?

37:11.228 --> 37:14.574
Two hundred and fifty quid a week?
Helping us out? do me a favor.

37:14.617 --> 37:17.398
Well, I didn't expect for one minute
that you'd be grateful.

37:17.485 --> 37:22.047
Okay, Beverley. I'm so fucking grateful.
Will that do?

37:22.091 --> 37:25.958
Oo-er. You just make sure you enjoy
this party tonight, darling,

37:26.045 --> 37:28.435
'cause it's the last thing
you're gonna get from us.

37:28.521 --> 37:33.692
Make sure you keep your legs
pressed tight together when you
ride Toby, make you all tingly.

37:33.736 --> 37:36.777
You do remember that feeling,
don't you?

37:36.864 --> 37:39.167
- Who's a naughty boy then?
- What?

37:39.254 --> 37:42.426
That little blond bit. That's why
you didn't bring your girlfriend.

37:42.470 --> 37:44.816
Who, her? No, she's not
with me. She's just...

37:44.859 --> 37:47.075
Well, she's with anyone,
if you know what I mean.

37:48.118 --> 37:50.074
Where is she?

38:08.367 --> 38:10.800
Groaning Continues]

38:14.928 --> 38:16.840
Oh, shit.

38:18.926 --> 38:21.316
You bastard.

38:21.358 --> 38:24.704
You do this here
in front of everyone.

38:26.790 --> 38:30.093
You bastard! Bastard!

38:30.180 --> 38:32.091
- Fucking bastard!
- Shut up!

38:32.135 --> 38:35.263
- You bastard! Get off me!
- Shut your fucking mouth!

38:35.307 --> 38:37.349
Just fucking cool off!

38:37.480 --> 38:41.043
Go on, fucking cool off!
You think you own me?

38:41.173 --> 38:44.475
"do this, Jason. do that, Jason."
Well, fuck you!

38:44.562 --> 38:49.560
I waited for you for five years!

38:49.646 --> 38:52.774
Yeah, you waited for me, did you?
You think I'm fucking stupid?

38:52.818 --> 38:56.858
- I didn't do anything!
- I don't believe you.

38:56.946 --> 39:01.030
I didn't do anything!

39:01.117 --> 39:04.246
Fuck off! You're like
a fucking leech!

39:08.373 --> 39:11.024
What the fuck
do I need you for, eh?

39:11.067 --> 39:13.544
I mean, why do you think
I go with other women, eh?

39:13.674 --> 39:15.587
Because you're
a fucking nuisance!

39:15.673 --> 39:18.107
You're not even a good fuck!

39:18.193 --> 39:20.106
I don't even fancy you anymore.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.452
That's a lie!

39:22.496 --> 39:24.451
That's a lie!

39:24.494 --> 39:26.450
Get her out of here.

40:00.125 --> 40:02.210
You all right?

40:02.297 --> 40:05.122
That bastard's done this
to me before.

40:06.469 --> 40:08.901
He got the last one pregnant.

40:08.945 --> 40:11.509
Another little blond bit.

40:12.595 --> 40:15.898
He had a little boy with her.

40:16.028 --> 40:19.461
You see...

40:19.504 --> 40:23.415
I can't have kids, Billy.

40:23.501 --> 40:25.978
That was a fucking laugh,
weren't it, for everyone else?

40:26.065 --> 40:29.498
Everyone looking at me, knowing.

40:31.758 --> 40:36.885
The joke is...
I actually waited for him.

40:50.789 --> 40:54.135
I used to sit
behind him in class.

40:56.090 --> 40:58.045
did you know that?

40:59.870 --> 41:02.478
I thought he was God's gift.

41:04.303 --> 41:06.258
All the girls fancied him.

41:08.170 --> 41:10.081
But I got him.

41:11.689 --> 41:14.688
I thought I was
such a lucky girl.

41:18.294 --> 41:20.250
Mm.

41:28.114 --> 41:30.417
Lisa. Lisa!

41:30.460 --> 41:33.415
Wait, hold on. I don't think
we should, all right.

41:33.503 --> 41:35.588
It's not that
I don't want to.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.585
Thanks, Billy.

41:46.538 --> 41:50.188
Thanks for not taking advantage of me
when I'm like this.

41:52.447 --> 41:54.924
Most of the other guys
would have jumped on me.

41:57.357 --> 41:59.313
You're different.

42:01.138 --> 42:03.049
Thanks.

42:04.831 --> 42:07.959
Um, it's just, um, you know...

42:08.003 --> 42:12.522
Billy. Billy, I'm taking
the piss out of you.

42:12.566 --> 42:14.563
Look at you.
You're no good to me.

42:14.607 --> 42:17.562
You're just a fucking pussy
like all the rest of them.

42:19.170 --> 42:21.560
Bring my bag.

42:46.761 --> 42:49.151
Tell Billy the groceries
are ready.

42:49.195 --> 42:51.629
I want this over
as quickly as possible.

43:48.463 --> 43:50.592
- All right? It's all in there.
- Yeah.

43:56.502 --> 43:58.413
You fucking beauty.

43:59.760 --> 44:02.194
There you go.

44:02.281 --> 44:04.627
Thanks.

44:04.714 --> 44:06.626
See you later.

44:06.713 --> 44:08.624
Have fun.

44:14.186 --> 44:17.228
Spotty dogs.

44:17.314 --> 44:19.227
Seen them, Billy?

44:22.008 --> 44:24.441
No.

44:24.528 --> 44:26.874
Here you are.

44:26.918 --> 44:28.873
Try one.

44:30.046 --> 44:31.958
Cheers, Wayne.

44:32.045 --> 44:35.912
Now, Jason is very anti-drugs.

44:35.999 --> 44:38.302
Thatis anti anyone else's drugs.

44:38.346 --> 44:41.995
It's an odanda wink and in goes
his man with a bag of Spotty Dogs.

44:42.082 --> 44:43.994
Thank you very much.

44:45.602 --> 44:47.557
See you later.

44:51.990 --> 44:54.162
- Oi!
- All right?

44:56.204 --> 44:58.637
- How's it going?
- Sweet.

44:58.681 --> 45:00.593
This is a piece of piss.

45:00.680 --> 45:03.113
What are we looking at
when we knock this lot out?

45:03.200 --> 45:05.634
I don't know,
200, maybe 250 profit.

45:05.720 --> 45:08.762
Quarter of a million?
Fuckin' hell!

45:08.848 --> 45:13.064
You've done well, Jase. You've come
through for us, just when we needed it.

45:13.107 --> 45:15.540
You know what this is?
It's a contract...

45:15.671 --> 45:18.843
to provide security for
Blondz nightclub in Southend.

45:18.929 --> 45:22.449
Sorted it out with the owners.
Got fed up with the other lot.
Too much aggravation.

45:22.536 --> 45:26.490
People flying through windows.
Perry Elley's out, we're in.

45:26.534 --> 45:29.618
Partners?

45:29.705 --> 45:31.530
Partners.

45:47.477 --> 45:50.475
I fuckin' love it here.
don'tyou?

45:52.735 --> 45:55.646
I tell you, I'm never going back
inside again, I tell you that.

45:55.690 --> 45:58.297
Where do you live, Billy?

45:58.383 --> 46:00.208
I'm in Canvey Island.

46:00.295 --> 46:02.207
Yeah?

46:03.989 --> 46:08.029
There she is!Hey!

46:08.117 --> 46:10.898
Bring the motor. Hey!

46:10.984 --> 46:12.897
Hey.

46:12.939 --> 46:15.199
Jason, I didn't mean to cause
any trouble the other night.

46:15.286 --> 46:17.242
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right.

46:17.285 --> 46:19.197
Get in the motor.
Let's have a laugh.

46:19.283 --> 46:21.239
- I didn't know you were married.
- I'm divorced.

46:21.326 --> 46:23.455
do you wanna marry me?
do you wanna get married?

46:23.542 --> 46:25.584
Billy. Billy,
you can be the witness.

46:25.715 --> 46:28.061
- I don't wanna cause any trouble.
- Well, I do. Come on.

46:34.188 --> 46:36.534
drive, Billy Whizz.

46:38.228 --> 46:40.836
Give me a couple of them Spotty dogs,
will you, Billy?

46:49.091 --> 46:53.393
Okay. Let's see
what this shit's like.

46:53.437 --> 46:55.826
No, Jason, please.
Please, will you just take me home?

46:55.870 --> 46:57.738
No chance.

46:59.129 --> 47:01.084
That's it.

47:18.378 --> 47:20.377
You and me, Billy Whizz.

47:20.463 --> 47:22.462
We'll run
that fuckin' gaff, eh?

47:31.631 --> 47:33.673
Nice one.

47:33.760 --> 47:35.976
You got some booze,
Billy Whizz?

47:36.063 --> 47:38.149
There's loads up there, Jase.

47:38.235 --> 47:40.147
Which way's the bedroom?

47:45.361 --> 47:47.925
This one?

47:47.969 --> 47:50.923
Jason, can't we just
have a drink first?

47:50.967 --> 47:53.009
- Come on.
- Ow!

47:53.096 --> 47:55.051
Bring some in later.

47:55.095 --> 47:58.006
Billy! Billy!
Get him off me!

47:58.050 --> 48:00.873
don't be silly.

48:04.045 --> 48:07.391
Jason, please, why don't
we go out another night?
Why don't we go out tomorrow?

48:07.435 --> 48:10.998
don't play hard-to-get, babe.
don't like that game.

48:11.085 --> 48:13.431
But I don't want to.
I just wanna go home.

48:13.518 --> 48:15.864
Billy! Billy, help me!

48:15.951 --> 48:21.035
Help me!
Jason, stop!

48:23.772 --> 48:26.336
Get off me!

48:26.380 --> 48:30.290
Get off me! Billy!

48:30.377 --> 48:34.723
Please, Billy!

48:34.853 --> 48:40.110
Get off me!
Get off me!

48:40.154 --> 48:42.457
I don't want to!

48:42.500 --> 48:46.932
Get off me!

48:47.019 --> 48:50.278
No!

48:50.366 --> 48:52.277
No!

48:52.321 --> 48:57.100
Get of me!
You're hurting...

48:57.143 --> 48:59.577
No!

49:03.791 --> 49:06.268
Why didn't you
just say no, eh?

49:10.917 --> 49:13.612
Why'd you have to fuck
about being clever?

49:18.696 --> 49:21.216
Why didn't you just say no?

49:21.303 --> 49:23.214
Fucking about being clever.

50:19.267 --> 50:24.221
Suzy, wake up.

50:24.221 --> 50:26.176
Suzy, wake up.

50:32.346 --> 50:34.736
Suzy, wake up, babe.

50:48.728 --> 50:50.683
Fuck.

51:01.850 --> 51:04.110
Come on, open up. We're freezing.

51:06.239 --> 51:08.715
Just wait a sec!

51:08.758 --> 51:11.366
It's cold, isn't it?

51:22.359 --> 51:25.705
Hiya. What's happened?
Look at the state of ya.

51:25.748 --> 51:28.486
- You can't come in. I'm sorry.
- Why not?

51:28.529 --> 51:30.484
You just can't.

51:30.614 --> 51:33.569
Why not, Billy?

51:33.613 --> 51:35.785
-You got some one in there, haven'tyou?
-No.

51:35.829 --> 51:37.741
Yes, you have.
Who is it?

51:39.479 --> 51:42.303
Come on, Candy.

51:42.347 --> 51:44.780
- Sorry, Candy.
- Don't talk toher!

51:44.867 --> 51:48.691
Just go back inside
and leave us alone, all right?

51:53.079 --> 51:55.121
This is a fucking nightmare.

51:56.251 --> 51:58.076
Twenty kids in hospital,

51:58.206 --> 52:00.857
throwing up, hallucinating.

52:00.944 --> 52:03.551
I've never seen Spotty dogs before.
Must have been a bad batch.

52:03.638 --> 52:05.550
Bad? It's disastrous!

52:05.637 --> 52:08.418
-It makes us look like fuckin' amateurs.
-What about her?

52:09.765 --> 52:12.328
I don't know.
Think of something.

52:12.415 --> 52:14.631
You're the fucking driver.
Fucking drive her!

52:14.718 --> 52:16.630
Somewhere! Anywhere!
I don't care!

52:16.674 --> 52:19.758
Just get rid of it!
I don't wanna hear about it again!

52:33.359 --> 52:36.140
Hurry up, Billy.
It'll be light soon.

52:54.694 --> 52:57.431
It's moments like this
that either make you...

52:57.518 --> 52:59.952
or break you.

52:59.994 --> 53:02.037
Come on.

53:03.428 --> 53:05.818
Either you learn
to live with it...

53:10.206 --> 53:12.292
or you crack up.

53:15.942 --> 53:18.201
Now which one
is it going to be?

53:30.020 --> 53:31.931
Henry!

53:34.887 --> 53:38.710
Henry.

53:59.871 --> 54:01.783
All right, John?

54:06.650 --> 54:08.605
do you think
I'd try and stiff you?

54:08.735 --> 54:11.386
Do you think I'm mad?

54:11.473 --> 54:15.253
It was a bad batch.
There was nothing I could do.

54:16.426 --> 54:19.728
You know,
when I was inside,

54:19.816 --> 54:22.162
I heard this screaming one day.

54:22.206 --> 54:25.117
So I went to have a look,
and I found yke here...

54:25.160 --> 54:29.115
bent over the table with his trousers
round his ankles,

54:29.157 --> 54:32.329
four big, hairy paddies holding
him down, about to bugger him.

54:34.198 --> 54:38.152
Old Henry, he's off playing bingo.
Ain't that right, Henry?

54:45.538 --> 54:49.015
Please. Please, Jason,
don't do...

54:49.102 --> 54:51.100
don't do anything stupid.

54:53.620 --> 54:56.141
That was the first time
I met you, wasn't it?

54:56.228 --> 54:58.140
Well, in a little while,

54:58.227 --> 55:00.182
you're gonna be wishing I'd walk
straight past you that day...

55:00.226 --> 55:02.486
- and just let 'em get on with it.
- I'm sorry.

55:02.528 --> 55:05.788
I'm sorry, Jason.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

55:13.261 --> 55:17.302
You've got 48 hours
to get me my money back...

55:17.433 --> 55:19.996
and the profit we lost.

55:20.083 --> 55:22.038
You fucking worm!

56:15.658 --> 56:17.917
What you gonna do about Lisa?

56:18.004 --> 56:21.003
Fuck all!

56:21.045 --> 56:25.173
- Hey, Billy Whizz, have you seen her?
- No.

56:25.260 --> 56:28.780
Where'd you take her then?
You drove her away.

56:28.867 --> 56:31.040
I brought her back here
and I went home.

56:31.126 --> 56:33.299
Leave her. She'll come back
with her tail between her legs,

56:33.386 --> 56:35.298
-likes he always does.
- What about that other business?

56:35.298 --> 56:37.905
- You sort that out as well?
- Yeah.

56:39.643 --> 56:42.424
- Where did you dump it?
- I sorted it out.

56:42.467 --> 56:45.075
That's all you need to know.

56:46.508 --> 56:49.289
- You ought to watch your fucking mouth.
- Leave him.

56:49.376 --> 56:52.896
- No! Fucking kid!
- Leave him, leave him. Come on.

56:52.983 --> 56:56.633
Billy, which one
do you want, eh?

56:56.720 --> 56:59.457
Huh? You can have
first choice,

56:59.587 --> 57:02.759
as long as it's not
the blond one.

57:02.847 --> 57:06.235
Um, I'll pass, thanks.

57:08.842 --> 57:11.276
Is it all right
if I see you lot later?

57:13.535 --> 57:16.924
Which one, Billy?
Where you going?

57:17.012 --> 57:20.357
I'm going home. I'm tired.

57:20.444 --> 57:23.486
- You're not leaving.
- Look, I've had enough. I want out.

57:23.572 --> 57:26.528
You don't want out on me,
you skinny, little prick!

57:26.570 --> 57:31.089
Now I said,
which one do you want, eh?

57:31.177 --> 57:33.784
This one? Eh?

57:33.870 --> 57:37.868
do you want this one,
or do you want this one, eh?

57:37.998 --> 57:41.910
No? Well, why not
do 'em both, eh?

57:41.996 --> 57:46.471
Now get in there and don't fucking
come out till you've done 'em!

57:52.468 --> 57:54.902
You know, I went to that place...
what's it called?

57:54.988 --> 57:57.856
Lakeside last week.

57:57.943 --> 58:01.115
I spent the whole afternoon
in a tea shop just watching.

58:01.158 --> 58:06.938
Something about the women
in that part of the world that
I find absolutely irresistible.

58:07.024 --> 58:10.283
Thought you were only
interested in Henry.

58:11.934 --> 58:15.714
No, they're fiercely pretty,
yet hard as nails,

58:15.758 --> 58:19.060
and it's a perfect combination.

58:20.364 --> 58:25.839
What I wouldn't give to have
my youth again in Essex.

58:25.925 --> 58:29.141
All I remember of my youth is getting
freezing cold under Southend Pier...

58:29.228 --> 58:31.445
with me knickers around me ankles.

58:33.530 --> 58:37.006
Well, I'll take you
under that pier again.

58:37.137 --> 58:39.135
You can haveyour knickers
around your ankles again.

58:44.523 --> 58:47.043
You know, I'm gonna
have to go back to him,
don'tyou?

58:51.084 --> 58:55.212
You know, I'm just about
to do something... really big.

58:57.211 --> 58:59.166
After that, I'll be able
to pay them of,

58:59.210 --> 59:02.034
and I'll still be
a very rich man.

59:02.121 --> 59:06.422
We could go somewhere
where he'd never find us.

59:19.805 --> 59:23.282
It's just a little investment. Spreading
out the old tentacles, youknow.

59:23.368 --> 59:25.324
Had bit of spare cash
laying about,

59:25.411 --> 59:27.887
and I fucking hate
waiting for cabs, so why not?

59:30.191 --> 59:32.928
- Perry.
- Oh, thanks, darling.

59:32.972 --> 59:35.839
-did you, uh, watch 'em make it?
- Yeah. Smoked salmon?

59:35.883 --> 59:37.838
Yeah, great.

59:39.532 --> 59:43.009
You know they gob in these things
in those places.

59:44.573 --> 59:47.398
So, what happened
to your face?

59:47.484 --> 59:50.395
Oh, I, I, uh...
I had some, um...

59:50.483 --> 59:54.002
- I had some problems the other night.
- Uh-huh.

59:54.089 --> 59:57.262
- So speak to me.
- Well, I just wanted
to talk about the drop,

59:57.304 --> 59:59.303
make sure everything's
going to plan.

59:59.347 --> 01:00:03.345
Oh, yeah. Everything's
still going to plan, John,

01:00:03.431 --> 01:00:05.561
except for one small detail.

01:00:05.604 --> 01:00:09.384
You're no longer
part of that plan.

01:00:09.428 --> 01:00:12.339
What's the matter?
You think I don't know about things?

01:00:12.382 --> 01:00:15.163
Perry, I need this job.
We've been friends for a long time.

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:17.205
Are you taking me
for a cunt, John?

01:00:17.249 --> 01:00:20.117
Perry, that was a one-off.

01:00:20.203 --> 01:00:22.811
John, are you
taking me for a cunt?

01:00:22.898 --> 01:00:25.853
- It's a very simple little question.
- No. No, of course not.

01:00:25.939 --> 01:00:30.980
Well, listen. Take my advice
and fuck off right now...

01:00:31.023 --> 01:00:33.456
before I lose my temper,
all right?

01:00:33.544 --> 01:00:38.453
Perry, you...
you can't just cut me out.

01:00:38.497 --> 01:00:41.625
Can't? Can't?

01:00:41.712 --> 01:00:44.015
You just watch me.

01:00:44.102 --> 01:00:48.273
The minute that you do business
with those fuckers, you become dirty.

01:00:48.361 --> 01:00:50.533
I can no longer trust you.

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.097
So now... you're gone.

01:00:54.965 --> 01:00:57.355
Fuck off.

01:00:58.702 --> 01:01:00.874
Nothing personal, John.

01:01:06.566 --> 01:01:09.738
I haven't got your money.

01:01:09.782 --> 01:01:11.781
But I've got something better,
a new proposition.

01:01:11.824 --> 01:01:13.823
Something that will be
worth much more.

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:15.952
-It'll make you a million each. Minimum.
-Come on, Jason.

01:01:15.996 --> 01:01:19.342
Let's listen to what he's gotta say.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:22.600
Perry Elley is flying in
a consignment of coke.

01:01:22.644 --> 01:01:24.685
- A big one.
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:24.773 --> 01:01:28.032
I know when and where
the drop is going to be made.

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:32.768
I can put you in the right place
at the right time to hit the courier.

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:36.505
We divide the consignment
into four,

01:01:36.548 --> 01:01:40.372
and that's a million a piece.

01:01:40.459 --> 01:01:42.371
And we get to whack
Perry Elley.

01:01:42.414 --> 01:01:44.370
It's perfect.

01:01:44.456 --> 01:01:46.369
There are two stipulations.

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:49.410
Stipulations?
Like what?

01:01:49.497 --> 01:01:53.625
First, this wipes the slate clean.

01:01:55.493 --> 01:01:59.099
And?

01:01:59.229 --> 01:02:02.054
And we never cross
each other's paths again.

01:02:14.916 --> 01:02:18.392
Why not? Who wants
to see you again anyway?

01:02:46.983 --> 01:02:49.590
So, now they're all in it together.

01:02:49.678 --> 01:02:52.110
A nice little
jolly boys outing.

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:56.680
Well, we're gonna need
a four-wheel drive, ain't we?

01:04:10.888 --> 01:04:14.017
The plane will come in
over the top of those trees,

01:04:14.148 --> 01:04:17.971
and the pilot will probably set it down
in that stretch of field over there.

01:04:18.014 --> 01:04:21.708
They have runway lights
that flick on at the last moment.

01:04:21.751 --> 01:04:24.880
Oh, yeah? Well, what if it's
raining then, like tonight?

01:04:24.923 --> 01:04:28.225
Shouldn't make any difference.

01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:33.744
Well, we can hole up over there
for a couple of hours
before they make the drop.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:36.786
Yeah. Get here nice and early.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.957
And then boom, boom,
fucking boom.

01:04:42.043 --> 01:04:45.215
Take out
the reception committee...

01:04:45.302 --> 01:04:47.692
and the courier.

01:04:47.735 --> 01:04:52.776
We'll need automatic weapons
and night sights.

01:04:52.862 --> 01:04:54.819
Yeah, we can do this.

01:04:59.163 --> 01:05:02.943
- When then?
- Oh.

01:05:02.987 --> 01:05:05.159
Soon.

01:05:05.247 --> 01:05:08.896
Look, I've, uh... I got the keys
to the, uh, to the gate here.

01:05:08.984 --> 01:05:10.939
You won't want me around,
will you?

01:05:10.982 --> 01:05:12.938
It's not my scene, really.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:17.022
What's the matter,
ykey? Squeamish?

01:05:17.066 --> 01:05:21.584
This is a field.
This is where worms belong.

01:05:21.714 --> 01:05:25.321
I wouldn't let you miss this,
not for the world.

01:05:25.408 --> 01:05:28.362
That goes for you too,
Billy Whizz.

01:05:40.877 --> 01:05:44.136
Who wants to be a millionaire

01:05:44.179 --> 01:05:46.134
We do

01:05:48.872 --> 01:05:52.348
Who wants to be a millionaire
We do

01:05:52.478 --> 01:05:55.129
There's no way we're gonna chuck
it all away, not what we've got.

01:05:55.215 --> 01:05:58.345
- Good.
- Yeah. I mean, we're really great together.

01:05:58.431 --> 01:06:00.865
Get us another bottle, will you, babe?

01:06:04.297 --> 01:06:06.252
Come here.

01:06:07.643 --> 01:06:09.903
You know, we've
discovered the secret...

01:06:09.946 --> 01:06:12.814
to a happy relationship,
haven't we, Lisa?

01:06:12.857 --> 01:06:15.334
I do what I want,
and she does what I tell her.

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:19.592
That's what works for us.

01:06:19.636 --> 01:06:23.459
And a back hander every now and then.

01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:27.457
Only it's important to have a secret
when they get to this age, you know.

01:06:27.544 --> 01:06:31.846
Once they get past 30,
they start getting saggy, you know?

01:06:31.932 --> 01:06:34.887
imples in their arses,
eh, Lisa?

01:06:38.233 --> 01:06:40.231
And their tits
start to hang down.

01:06:42.535 --> 01:06:47.749
And they still wear frilly underwear,
but it don'tlook very nice, no.

01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:57.135
But I tell you, they're still handy
for carrying and fetching.

01:06:57.178 --> 01:07:00.307
Now go on, get some glasses.

01:07:00.393 --> 01:07:03.348
Billy Whizz, give her a hand.

01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:20.946
He's a fucking arsehole.

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:24.074
Forget it.
I can handle him.

01:07:24.118 --> 01:07:27.550
When this all comes off, perhaps
you should bury the hatchet with yke.

01:07:27.594 --> 01:07:30.983
- He could be useful.
- Oh, I'll bury it in his fucking head.

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:36.849
Look, I've made up me mind.

01:07:36.936 --> 01:07:39.804
We hit yke
and have his share between us.

01:07:39.891 --> 01:07:43.540
About the other night,
I'm really sorry for what I said.

01:07:43.584 --> 01:07:45.713
I was hurt, and when
I'm hurt, I lash out.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.625
You just happened
to be in the way.

01:07:48.711 --> 01:07:52.231
- Are we still friends?
- Yeah, no problem.

01:07:52.274 --> 01:07:56.663
What about Billy Whizz?
Can we trust him?

01:07:58.445 --> 01:08:00.356
No. Better do him and all.

01:08:56.714 --> 01:08:59.971
Evening, Billy.

01:09:23.001 --> 01:09:25.131
How many of them
will there be?

01:09:26.825 --> 01:09:29.606
About three or four,
I should think.

01:09:31.908 --> 01:09:34.212
They'll all have to
be taken out.

01:09:40.381 --> 01:09:42.337
Fucking hell.

01:10:12.276 --> 01:10:14.405
Wish me luck.

01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:21.140
All right, Billy Whizz!
You wanker!

01:10:31.221 --> 01:10:33.915
Heckler & Koch MP5.

01:10:34.001 --> 01:10:36.696
Fires a standard
9mm Parabellum round.

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:39.912
Thirty rounds a magazine, eight hundred
rounds a minute on full auto.

01:10:39.998 --> 01:10:42.040
Fucking quality.

01:10:43.344 --> 01:10:45.821
We couldn't get
the night sights,

01:10:45.864 --> 01:10:49.340
so we're just gonna have
to get in close, eh?

01:10:49.427 --> 01:10:51.382
Shall we go?

01:10:51.469 --> 01:10:53.381
What's up, Mr. Worm?

01:11:02.245 --> 01:11:04.679
Who wants to be a millionaire

01:11:04.722 --> 01:11:06.677
We do, we do

01:11:06.764 --> 01:11:08.676
- Who do?
- We do!

01:11:08.763 --> 01:11:10.718
Yeah!

01:12:19.155 --> 01:12:22.022
I'll get the gate, shall I?

01:12:51.005 --> 01:12:52.960
Boom.

01:13:00.955 --> 01:13:02.911
Hello.

01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:04.996
Where are you?
You sound funny.

01:13:08.082 --> 01:13:10.341
Yeah? Yeah,
get a couple of bottles.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.408
Shut up, Billy!

01:13:42.495 --> 01:13:44.406
There's no need
for this, John.

01:13:44.494 --> 01:13:46.449
You can keep it all.

01:13:46.493 --> 01:13:50.273
Oh, Jason,
you foolish, greedy boy.

01:13:50.317 --> 01:13:53.358
There are no drugs.

01:13:53.445 --> 01:13:55.530
There is noplane.

01:13:55.618 --> 01:13:58.138
You want to mess with me?
You're not in the same league.

01:14:00.701 --> 01:14:02.830
I thought we were mates.

01:14:02.874 --> 01:14:04.873
I looked after you in prison.

01:14:04.915 --> 01:14:07.175
I'm a man of honor, Jason.
I always pay my debts.

01:14:07.263 --> 01:14:09.739
Please.

01:14:09.826 --> 01:14:11.868
This is silly.

01:14:11.955 --> 01:14:16.169
Billy, you said you wanted to know
how far this was going to take you.

01:14:16.213 --> 01:14:18.168
- No! don't!
- Hold it, John.

01:14:33.073 --> 01:14:35.114
- Leave him, Henry.
- He's a witness.

01:14:35.158 --> 01:14:39.243
I'm not having this little bastard
hanging over me.

01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:42.763
No, no, no.
Leave him alone, Henry.

01:14:47.846 --> 01:14:50.193
That's enough for tonight.

01:15:21.347 --> 01:15:25.258
Who wants to be a millionaire

01:15:25.345 --> 01:15:27.300
They don't

01:16:52.987 --> 01:16:56.724
Hello, Billy.
Yeah, come in.

01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:58.853
You can listen to this.

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.938
Obviously,
if you don't mind, Lisa.

01:17:00.982 --> 01:17:02.937
I had no idea where
Jason was going that night.

01:17:03.024 --> 01:17:06.066
Yeah, but... That's weird though, isn't
it? It's not very romantic, is it?

01:17:06.153 --> 01:17:10.020
He'd been out of prison for,
what, two weeks?

01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:14.931
I mean, he's hanging out with
all sorts of strange people,
leaving you here home alone.

01:17:15.017 --> 01:17:16.972
Don't know who he's with,
where he is.

01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:19.623
My husband fucked around.
Is that what you want to hear?

01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:26.184
- You ever heard of Suzy Welch?
- Who?

01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:29.834
Suzy Welch. Young girl.

01:17:29.921 --> 01:17:32.050
Very pretty.

01:17:34.092 --> 01:17:38.003
on't know whether your husband
associated with her in the last
couple of weeks, do you?

01:17:38.133 --> 01:17:40.176
It's possible.

01:17:40.262 --> 01:17:42.826
If she had a cute arse,
it's certainly possible.

01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:46.650
Hmm. She disappeared.

01:17:46.694 --> 01:17:48.735
And you think Jason's death
may have something to do with it?

01:17:48.779 --> 01:17:50.517
Some one killed him
because of her?

01:17:50.604 --> 01:17:52.559
Thanks. Makes me feel really great.

01:17:52.603 --> 01:17:55.036
Oh. I've upset you now, ain't I?

01:17:55.079 --> 01:17:57.296
I didn't mean to do that.

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:02.509
All right.
I'll leavey ou here.

01:18:02.597 --> 01:18:05.595
Leave you two in your grief.

01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:07.637
Billy.

01:18:09.983 --> 01:18:11.895
Used to drive for Jason,
didn't you?

01:18:11.982 --> 01:18:15.371
Yeah, now and again,
but not that night, obviously.

01:18:15.415 --> 01:18:17.805
Obviously.

01:18:19.499 --> 01:18:21.889
I'll be in touch.

01:18:50.394 --> 01:18:53.696
You didn't think I'd go through
with it, did you? Admit it.

01:18:53.782 --> 01:18:56.954
No.

01:18:57.041 --> 01:18:59.649
I did it for you.

01:18:59.692 --> 01:19:02.256
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for two hours.

01:19:03.863 --> 01:19:05.776
I've had the police around.

01:19:05.862 --> 01:19:09.947
- I'm sorry.
- It worries me how much they know.

01:19:10.033 --> 01:19:11.989
Oh, what can they know?
They know nothing.

01:19:12.032 --> 01:19:15.378
The only people who can
tell them anything... can't speak.

01:19:15.465 --> 01:19:19.332
Billy can. They know
he drove for Jason.

01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:21.896
No. Billy's all right.
on't worry about Billy.

01:19:21.939 --> 01:19:23.851
You sure you can trust him?

01:19:23.938 --> 01:19:27.153
No. He's too scared
to say anything.

01:19:28.326 --> 01:19:30.281
So, how are you?

01:19:30.325 --> 01:19:32.932
Is the burden of knowledge
weighing you down?

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:35.105
No. I'm fine.

01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:37.408
It's like I told you, Billy.

01:19:37.451 --> 01:19:42.188
It's moments like this
that will make you...

01:19:42.231 --> 01:19:44.839
or break you.

01:19:44.925 --> 01:19:47.315
Have the police been to see you?

01:19:47.359 --> 01:19:50.226
Yeah. There was a smart arse
Old Bill around Lisa's.

01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:52.268
- What did he ask you?
- Nothing.

01:19:52.356 --> 01:19:54.658
- He just give me his card
and said he'd get in touch.
- Good.

01:19:54.746 --> 01:19:57.005
We must expect this, Billy.
It's perfectly normal.

01:19:57.048 --> 01:19:59.134
They'll be questioning
all his associates.

01:19:59.221 --> 01:20:01.046
I'm sure they'll be
talking to me at some point.

01:20:01.089 --> 01:20:05.521
The situation
is very simple, Billy.

01:20:05.565 --> 01:20:07.824
The only people who
know what happened...

01:20:07.868 --> 01:20:11.648
are you, me and Henry.

01:20:11.734 --> 01:20:14.298
The other people who knew...

01:20:14.385 --> 01:20:16.514
are, of course, dead.

01:20:16.602 --> 01:20:19.295
Mr... you know, I...
I, like...

01:20:19.383 --> 01:20:22.337
I wouldn't say a word
about this to anyone.

01:20:24.770 --> 01:20:29.029
Look. All this work
for a drainage trench.

01:20:29.115 --> 01:20:32.375
Can you believe how obsessed
Henry gets about this garden?

01:20:36.068 --> 01:20:39.848
I'm bringing a shipment in
this week.

01:20:39.934 --> 01:20:43.324
I wanted to make sure
I could rely on you.

01:20:43.411 --> 01:20:45.366
Y-Yeah, ofcourse.
Nothing's changed.

01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:48.842
Now tell me, how's Lisa?
I haven't seen her for awhile.

01:20:48.930 --> 01:20:51.406
Uh, she's a bit upset.

01:20:53.361 --> 01:20:57.620
I want you to, uh,
look after her a bit.

01:20:57.706 --> 01:21:00.792
drive her around, make sure
she doesn't come to any harm.

01:21:02.617 --> 01:21:04.876
I'm worried about her.

01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:18.694
I'm taking over
the business, Beverley.

01:21:18.737 --> 01:21:20.693
- I want the books.
- Go fuck yourself.

01:21:20.736 --> 01:21:23.083
Lend me one of your vibrators,
and I will.

01:21:23.126 --> 01:21:25.168
Which one's been your favorite
since Peter got splattered?

01:21:25.299 --> 01:21:26.906
You bitch!

01:21:26.993 --> 01:21:29.687
Fucking try that again,
I'll fucking do you!

01:21:29.774 --> 01:21:34.728
What gives you the right to think you
can just come in here and take over?

01:21:34.814 --> 01:21:38.203
'Cause who's gonna stop me?
You, Beverley?

01:21:38.291 --> 01:21:41.028
don't make me laugh.
Look at you.

01:21:41.114 --> 01:21:43.809
This place. This stuff.

01:21:43.895 --> 01:21:46.329
You got your drinks trolley,
chandelier, piano.

01:21:46.373 --> 01:21:48.763
Can you even play
the piano, Beverley?

01:21:48.805 --> 01:21:51.500
And how'd you get all of this, eh?
Of of Jason's back.

01:21:51.586 --> 01:21:54.889
- That's how.
- You're the one's who's
got everything on your back.

01:21:54.976 --> 01:21:58.235
don't annoy me, Beverley. The terms
are getting worse all the time.

01:21:58.365 --> 01:22:00.625
Now, you can keep
this house and the cars.

01:22:00.712 --> 01:22:03.275
I'm taking over the doors.
If you have a problem with that,

01:22:03.405 --> 01:22:06.186
you can have a chat with Kiri Christos
about the money you owe him.

01:22:06.274 --> 01:22:09.316
What am I supposed to live on?

01:22:09.358 --> 01:22:11.922
Yeah.

01:22:11.966 --> 01:22:14.703
I've been thinking about that.

01:22:21.047 --> 01:22:23.481
250 quid a week.

01:22:23.567 --> 01:22:26.522
Remember? That's what Peter
was paying me when Jason was inside.

01:22:28.608 --> 01:22:31.866
That's when he wasn't trying
to get inside my knickers.

01:22:31.954 --> 01:22:33.865
Fair's fair, eh, Beverley?

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.751
Where now?

01:24:13.934 --> 01:24:16.889
I keep turning it
over and over in my mind.

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.582
I must have been speaking to him
just before he died.

01:24:20.626 --> 01:24:22.625
Yeah?

01:24:25.058 --> 01:24:29.055
- Where were you, Billy?
- Me? I was at home watching the telly.

01:24:29.143 --> 01:24:31.098
Well, I knew they were
planning something.

01:24:31.142 --> 01:24:33.357
Why didn't they
want you to drive 'em?

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.573
don't know. They were all
very secretive about it.

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:38.919
- You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, Billy?
- I weren't there.

01:24:41.091 --> 01:24:43.090
So, who do you think done it?

01:24:43.134 --> 01:24:46.132
don't know. Perry Elley?

01:24:46.219 --> 01:24:48.782
What about John yke? do you think he
could have had anything to do with it?

01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:53.867
No. Mr...? No.
Why, do you?

01:24:55.735 --> 01:24:57.690
I don't know.

01:24:57.734 --> 01:25:01.209
There's just something about him
that's not quite right.

01:25:52.135 --> 01:25:55.481
Lisa, there's...

01:25:55.568 --> 01:25:58.175
- there's something I gotta tell ya.
- What?

01:25:58.218 --> 01:26:00.652
It's been playing on my mind.

01:26:00.695 --> 01:26:02.912
What has?

01:26:02.954 --> 01:26:05.693
It's about Jason.

01:26:05.779 --> 01:26:07.821
And just, like...

01:26:07.908 --> 01:26:10.037
The way he died.

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:16.121
How did he die, Billy?

01:26:18.336 --> 01:26:20.291
I just...

01:26:20.335 --> 01:26:24.898
I just keep thinking it... it's
gonna happen to you and me.

01:26:32.154 --> 01:26:36.456
- Hello?
- Billy, the groceries are ready.

01:26:36.499 --> 01:26:40.019
Oh, right, yeah.
Um, I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:26:40.106 --> 01:26:43.756
- Where are you?
- I'm at home. I'm on me way.

01:26:43.799 --> 01:26:45.754
Where's Lisa?

01:26:45.841 --> 01:26:49.448
I, uh, I... I... She went shopping.
I dropped her off.

01:26:49.492 --> 01:26:52.750
Okay. Be as quick as you can.

01:28:33.602 --> 01:28:35.253
Yeah, you fuck.

01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:40.032
Fuck.

01:30:58.339 --> 01:31:02.684
I had high hopes of you, Billy.

01:31:02.727 --> 01:31:05.378
Thought you had brains.

01:31:05.465 --> 01:31:08.854
Not like those other animals.

01:31:08.942 --> 01:31:13.503
I was prepared to help you.

01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:16.850
I knew you'd make mistakes.

01:31:18.674 --> 01:31:20.803
Then you went too far.

01:31:23.584 --> 01:31:27.017
She belongs to me, Billy.

01:31:27.061 --> 01:31:29.928
I don't want you to touch her!

01:32:02.604 --> 01:32:06.167
You wanted to know
where this would take you.

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:09.904
Billy, it ends here!

01:33:38.111 --> 01:33:40.023
You fucker!

01:34:05.529 --> 01:34:09.440
Lisa, it's me. They just fucking
shot me. I can't believe this shit.

01:34:09.526 --> 01:34:12.047
- Are you okay?
- No, I fuckin' ain't okay!

01:34:12.177 --> 01:34:15.305
They just tried to kill me! Why didn't
you tell me about you and yke?

01:34:15.393 --> 01:34:17.956
- What the fuck's going on?
- Listen, it's a little difficult.

01:34:18.043 --> 01:34:20.606
Little difficult?
Well, I'll tell you something, Lisa.

01:34:20.694 --> 01:34:22.605
They fucking killed Jason.

01:34:22.692 --> 01:34:24.560
Okay. Can you drive?

01:34:24.648 --> 01:34:27.776
did you hear what I just said?
They killed Jason, Lisa.

01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:29.861
- I fucking saw them.
- I can't talk right now.

01:34:29.905 --> 01:34:31.990
- Can you drive?
- Yeah, I can drive.

01:34:32.034 --> 01:34:35.076
- Okay. I'll meet you at number six.
- Number six? The motel?

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.075
- Yeah, that's right.
- You will be there?

01:34:37.161 --> 01:34:39.116
Yeah, I'll be there.

01:34:39.116 --> 01:34:41.767
don't fuck me up, Lisa.
I need you.

01:34:43.288 --> 01:34:46.765
I'm really sorry, Perry.
Something's come up.

01:34:46.895 --> 01:34:50.631
It's girl stuff.
Can we continue this later?

01:34:50.719 --> 01:34:54.629
Oh, that's a shame. do you know
they make these with fresh fruit?

01:34:54.759 --> 01:34:56.846
Tell you what.

01:34:56.932 --> 01:34:59.061
You can have my cherry.

01:35:19.701 --> 01:35:22.656
We can't stay here 'cause
he'll come here. He'll find us.

01:35:22.742 --> 01:35:24.828
It's all right, it's all right.
We're safe for the time being.

01:35:24.958 --> 01:35:28.304
- Let's get you out of this.
- It fucking hurts.

01:35:28.391 --> 01:35:32.128
It's okay. We've gotta get you
cleaned up, get you in the bath.

01:35:38.038 --> 01:35:40.036
Why didn't you tell me
about you and him?

01:35:40.123 --> 01:35:42.078
There's nothing to tell.

01:35:42.165 --> 01:35:44.121
He's got some sort of
obsession with me, that's all.

01:35:44.164 --> 01:35:46.728
Just got out of hand.

01:35:46.772 --> 01:35:50.377
Well, he's just tried to fucking
kill me. He nearly did and all.

01:35:52.767 --> 01:35:55.592
- He'll kill you too.
- Let's deal with
one problem at a time, eh?

01:35:55.636 --> 01:35:57.677
What have you done here?

01:36:02.370 --> 01:36:04.803
Well, we got them "E's" next door.

01:36:04.891 --> 01:36:07.932
We can sell them two bags of pills
and just get out of here.

01:36:07.975 --> 01:36:10.018
What do you think?

01:36:10.104 --> 01:36:13.624
I'm gonna need some antiseptic,
some tweezers and a dressing.
What's the time?

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:16.275
Look, I'm gonna find
a late night chemist.

01:36:16.362 --> 01:36:18.317
I'll take your clothes
to the laundry too.

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.881
We can't have you checking out
covered in mud.

01:36:20.924 --> 01:36:22.880
Come on, drink up.

01:36:22.923 --> 01:36:24.748
What do you think?

01:36:26.356 --> 01:36:30.092
I think it's a really good idea, Billy.
Just you and me together.

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.263
Well, don't be too long.

01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:37.392
I won't.

01:37:18.323 --> 01:37:21.104
Where are you?

01:37:21.148 --> 01:37:23.277
don't know.
You sound funny.

01:37:24.755 --> 01:37:26.797
Good-bye, Jason.

01:37:49.262 --> 01:37:52.216
- Hello.
- Good-bye, Billy.

01:38:02.557 --> 01:38:04.470
John, you don't
have to do this!

01:38:04.556 --> 01:38:06.511
I didn't know nothing
about you and her!

01:38:06.599 --> 01:38:09.249
I swear to God!
I wouldn't have happened if I had.

01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:11.509
John, John, here's the gear.

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:13.942
Look!

01:38:14.029 --> 01:38:16.549
I'm not gonna keep it.
You have it.

01:38:20.676 --> 01:38:22.806
I'll go away, John,
and I'll never come back!

01:38:22.893 --> 01:38:24.848
You'll never see me again!

01:38:24.892 --> 01:38:29.280
John, I won't say a fucking word!
I'll disappear!

01:38:33.929 --> 01:38:36.580
We are the police! We are armed!

01:38:36.667 --> 01:38:39.230
Come out of the cabin
with your arms up in the air!

01:38:52.744 --> 01:38:55.047
Come out of the cabin.

01:38:56.916 --> 01:39:01.261
Walk forward.
Walk forward!

01:39:01.347 --> 01:39:04.172
Get down on your knees.

01:39:04.216 --> 01:39:07.474
Face down. Face down!

01:39:11.037 --> 01:39:13.123
Now spread your legs.

01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:20.336
It was... very funny.

01:39:20.379 --> 01:39:22.335
It was hilarious.

01:39:22.378 --> 01:39:26.593
I mean, Mr. D. 's gonna kill Lisa,
and I've become a liability.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.896
And now she's rubbing noses
with Perry Elley.

01:39:28.983 --> 01:39:32.850
- She needs both of us out ofher life.
- Hello, Billy Whizz.

01:39:32.893 --> 01:39:35.631
So, the Old Bill
gets ananonymous tip,

01:39:35.718 --> 01:39:38.455
and they catch this fella
red-handed...

01:39:38.542 --> 01:39:42.279
in a Southend motel room
with 50 grand's worth of pills.

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:46.668
This fella's looking at
ten years inside, easy,

01:39:46.754 --> 01:39:48.667
unless he can make a trade.

01:39:48.753 --> 01:39:53.228
Turns outhe's only the witness
to a shocking triple murder.

01:39:55.358 --> 01:39:57.356
Essex boys?

01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.964
She done the lot of us.
