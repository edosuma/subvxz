00:09.009 --> 00:11.803
What happened to my birthday cake?

00:11.887 --> 00:13.680
- Goober.
- It wasn't me.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.475
But you're welcome to check my pockets.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.268
- Go home, Goober.
- Go home, Goober.

00:20.062 --> 00:23.148
<i>Oh, I was a Goober, all right.</i>
<i>I Goobed with the best of 'em.</i>

00:23.607 --> 00:24.942
But that ain't me anymore.

00:25.025 --> 00:29.821
I'm now the proprietor/spokesperson/
number one customer of Whale World.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.282
At Whale World, families come together

00:32.366 --> 00:36.286
to admire the fine female form
of the majestic killer whale.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.955
It's educational.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.623
<i>Join us in the Splash Zone.</i>

00:39.706 --> 00:42.501
You and your little ones
are gonna get moist.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.211
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:47.589
<i>These orcas have the floppiest</i>
<i>dorsal fins in town</i>

00:47.673 --> 00:50.884
<i>and they can't wait to jump</i>
<i>through hoops for you and your kids.</i>

00:50.968 --> 00:53.053
Bring your prepubescent daughters,

00:53.136 --> 00:56.265
who are beginning to be cognizant
of a woman's role in the world.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.976
They won't internalize
deeply problematic notions

00:59.059 --> 01:02.104
about the commodification
of sexuality in today's society.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.398
What are you talking about?
It's just whales.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.109
And what about so-called "experts,"

01:07.192 --> 01:09.528
who say it's wrong
to keep these girls in captivity

01:09.611 --> 01:11.280
so they can amuse and entertain us?

01:11.363 --> 01:14.575
Well, to those people I say,
"Stop saying that, okay?"

01:15.242 --> 01:17.828
These sea girls are my family,
and my business.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.162
And they can be yours too.

01:19.246 --> 01:23.750
Come on down to Whale World,
a fun, sexy time for the whole family.

01:26.211 --> 01:32.843
<i>♪ ♪ </i>

02:21.933 --> 02:24.728
<i>♪ It is winter, yes, that's right ♪</i>

02:24.811 --> 02:27.981
<i>♪ A time for family and lights ♪</i>

02:28.065 --> 02:31.193
<i>♪ It doesn't mean God</i>
<i>And it doesn't mean pray ♪</i>

02:31.276 --> 02:34.279
<i>♪ Unless that's what you want</i>
<i>But who are we to say? ♪</i>

02:35.238 --> 02:37.366
- Hey, Jill.
- Where are you? I hear mirth.

02:37.449 --> 02:41.912
An elementary school all inclusive
non-denominational winter day pageant.

02:41.995 --> 02:46.667
Oh, no. The snow goblin wants to destroy
our seasonal festivities.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.252
"Snow goblin" is an offensive slur.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.463
Jesus, Jill.
And you thought your play sucked.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.923
- I didn't.
- <i>Well, regardless.</i>

02:53.006 --> 02:55.759
A lot of these fancy kids'
fancy parents are Oscar voters.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.136
If I wanna get nominated,
I got to rub elbows

02:58.220 --> 03:00.639
and whatever the non-denominational
word for schmooze is.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.642
Hobnob. Did you check
on Cuddlywhiskers like I asked?

03:03.725 --> 03:06.019
He's doing great.
Little of this, little of that.

03:06.103 --> 03:09.106
Likes to go jogging... in a big wheel.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.149
- You didn't check on him, did you?
- Completely forgot.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.527
- Shh! Keep it down, buddy.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.988
Did you miss the three wise people make
their journey to visit the regular baby?

03:17.072 --> 03:18.323
Go to his house.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.826
If he's not there, you must retrieve
something for me,

03:20.909 --> 03:23.620
something of a sensitive nature.

03:23.703 --> 03:27.666
Oh, fine, if it'll finally make you stop
calling me, asking me to go on errands.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.376
- What do you need?
- A letter I wrote him,

03:29.459 --> 03:33.004
back when we were, prepare yourself,
I'm about to say lovers... Lovers.

03:33.088 --> 03:36.299
- That was not enough time to prepare.
- Get off the phone, jerk.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.677
It was years ago
and it was quite beautiful

03:38.760 --> 03:42.222
and disgusting all at once.
I remember it fondly. And horribly.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.975
- What's in the letter?
- None of your concern. I must have it,

03:45.058 --> 03:48.729
for... sentimental reasons. Goodbye.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.565
- Did you have a nice phone call?
- Are you in the Academy?

03:51.648 --> 03:53.233
- No.
- Then I don't care what you think.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.610
- I got to go do a thing for someone.
- Fine.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.739
You made your appearance,
you were magnificent, I'm very proud.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.742
But don't forget, you have a full day
of muckety-muck glad-handing.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.870
The Bat Mitzvah,
the senior Academy member meet and greet.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.997
You'll be wonderful,
I have complete faith in you.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.791
That is literally the first time
anyone ever said that to me.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.793
Diane, you'll keep up
his Internet presence?

04:11.877 --> 04:13.628
I want him trending by this afternoon.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.631
But good trending, not bad trending,
you understand?

04:16.715 --> 04:17.966
Hashtag you betcha.

04:18.049 --> 04:21.553
Did I just say hashtag out loud?
Hashtag, oops. Hashtag, oh no!

04:21.636 --> 04:24.139
I'm honestly more alarmed
by the "you betcha".

04:24.222 --> 04:26.475
I'll take a smoke break
before these little boogers

04:26.558 --> 04:29.436
dig into the refrain
of "Frosty the Non-Gendered Snow Person."

04:29.519 --> 04:32.397
Ugh. Could you imagine having a kid? Eww.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.067
<i>I'm Terry Gross</i>
<i>and this is your ring tone.</i>

04:36.151 --> 04:37.819
<i>I'm here with novelist Jonathan Lethem.</i>

04:37.903 --> 04:39.821
<i>Jonathan,</i>
<i>how did you become a ring tone?</i>

04:39.905 --> 04:41.823
<i>You know, Terry,</i>
<i>growing up in Brooklyn,</i>

04:41.907 --> 04:45.952
<i>I was always fascinated by ring tones</i>
<i>and the stories they told.</i>

04:46.036 --> 04:47.078
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.122
Hello, my precious darling
slice of sunshine,

04:49.206 --> 04:51.082
who I am <i>not </i>putting on a pedestal.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.168
Just calling for our daily download,

04:53.251 --> 04:56.004
as per Dr. Janet's
friendly but firm suggestion.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.672
When do you think you'll be home?

04:57.756 --> 05:00.467
- Uh, it might be late.
- Okay, just let me know.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.886
I cherish you, I respect you
and you have value.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.806
I feel valued and I value you.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.475
I am hearing that and I accept that.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.393
- Diane?
- Yes?

05:10.477 --> 05:11.770
<i>Do you accept my acceptance?</i>

05:11.853 --> 05:17.275
I hear it and I accept it and I value it
and all the other verbs.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.110
Promise you won't work too hard today?

05:19.194 --> 05:22.864
I won't, if you promise me
you won't bother that skunk next door.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.991
I don't want to come home
to a stinky husband.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.537
That is some great food for thought.
I gotta go right now.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.836
Mr. Peanutbutter,
my favorite weekday client.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.171
- Why are you calling on the weekend?
- I need your help.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.006
I've done something bad, very bad.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.259
Put the corpse on ice, I'm on my way.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.594
What? No, it's not. Why would I--

05:44.678 --> 05:47.889
Listen, I was sniffing around
where I didn't belong and I got skunked.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.266
- What?
<i>- You got to help us.</i>

05:49.349 --> 05:50.559
- Us?
- Todd's here too.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.061
I'm skunked, Princess Carolyn.
Skunked real bad.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.981
Yeah, yeah, we got real bad skunked,
super skunked.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.817
- Hardcore.
- Yeah, hardcore skunked.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.945
Okay. First things first,
don't go back in the house.

06:02.028 --> 06:06.700
Sadly, you can call me L.L. Cool J
because I am in the house.

06:06.783 --> 06:10.412
Yecch! Okay, don't move.
I'll be there in 20.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.294
Mind if I do this real quick?
I gotta pick up a letter.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.005
Can we make the appearances
we're supposed to make and go home?

06:20.088 --> 06:21.464
Oh, sure.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.634
I haven't seen you much
since you moved out of my deck chairs.

06:24.718 --> 06:28.263
You know, I've been focusing
on my new job and my marriage and--

06:28.346 --> 06:31.016
- And avoiding me?
- I'm not avoiding you.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.477
I'm just making an effort
to not be in a room alone with you

06:34.561 --> 06:38.898
- because I am... avoiding you.
- Oh.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.068
You know, I think we're alike
in a lot of ways.

06:42.152 --> 06:45.071
I always tell people
you're like the not-cool version of me.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.573
Sometimes that's great,

06:46.656 --> 06:49.618
but it also means we can bring out
the worst in each other.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.536
I'm trying to get my life back on track.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.080
I just think maybe it's better,
for both of us,

06:54.164 --> 06:57.250
if we keep things
a little more professional.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.710
Yes, okay. Professional.

06:58.793 --> 07:02.672
BoJack and Diane being professional.
Doing our jobs and nothing else.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.883
We're at the place I needed to go to.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.843
It's so weird I drove here on accident.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.596
Might as well run in
and grab that thing I need to get.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.182
Then, back to business.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.816
- It's spooky in here. Too spooky.
- Really?

07:21.900 --> 07:25.987
And what would be the right amount
of spooky? Jesus, this thing's heavy.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.448
Now I know how Hilary Swank's arms
got so jacked.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.699
Put it down, BoJack.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.409
Does it look weird?
Me with an Oscar?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.912
- I actually think that it feels--
- Oh, my God.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.749
- I think she's dead.
- Hold on, maybe she's not dead.

07:37.832 --> 07:41.378
Maybe she's just being a-- a whale?
No, she's dead.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.004
Maybe there's someone
in her phone we can call.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.839
Diane, kids these days don't call.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.467
They communicate
via a combination of text messages,

07:47.550 --> 07:49.719
- eye rolls, and dick pics.
- Oh, my God.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.097
What is it? Dick pics?
See if they spell out a message.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.182
Freeze! Drop the Oscar!

07:54.265 --> 07:57.352
- Oh, man.
- Well, well, well.

07:57.435 --> 08:01.356
Or should I say whale, whale, whale?
Killer whale, that is.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.692
Or should I say <i>killed</i> whale?

08:03.775 --> 08:05.777
- Listen, Officer--
- I told you to freeze.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.656
You just became prime suspects
in the case I like to call,

08:09.739 --> 08:14.160
"Black and White and Dead All Over,
A Whale Of A Crime:

08:14.244 --> 08:17.539
An Officer Meow Meow Fuzzyface Mystery."

08:17.622 --> 08:18.540
Eh...

08:18.623 --> 08:22.252
- Cuff 'em, boys, or, uh, girls.
- I am a woman, sir.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.170
Lindsay, you know I am trying.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.007
Can we please show a united front
in front of the perps?

08:27.090 --> 08:29.467
- We will talk about this later.
- Aww.

08:31.052 --> 08:34.264
Ohh! It smells like a skunk
skunked another skunk in here,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.307
then they smoked a joint.
What happened?

08:36.391 --> 08:40.020
First I rolled all over the couch
to get the skunk stench out,

08:40.103 --> 08:41.312
but that did not work.

08:41.396 --> 08:45.442
Then I ran into every room to rub myself
on all my clothes and belongings,

08:45.525 --> 08:47.569
to get the Mr. Peanutbutter smell back.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.237
And then I smoked a joint,

08:49.320 --> 08:51.823
so that might be
why it smells like skunk in here.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.993
Princess Carolyn, I have to fix this
before Diane gets home.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.619
Things have been shaky with us

08:56.703 --> 08:58.913
since she pretended
to be out of the country for two months.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.832
And then when I filled our entire house

09:00.915 --> 09:03.418
with these giant crates
of spaghetti strainers, that did not help.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.879
Why buy these spaghetti strainers
in the first place?

09:05.962 --> 09:09.257
Oh, I don't even remember.
I'm sure it'll pay off at some point.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.301
Man, married life is weird.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.054
We're making an effort
and getting stronger every day,

09:14.137 --> 09:17.599
but I swear to God we are like five
big fights away from a divorce,

09:17.682 --> 09:19.476
I do not want this to be one.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.270
Okay, number first.
We got to get you in a tomato bath.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.439
Mmm! Delicious and nutritious.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.523
Is marinara all right,

09:25.607 --> 09:27.776
or will I need something zestier
like Arrabiata?

09:27.859 --> 09:30.612
Tomato bath.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.821
Whoa!

09:31.905 --> 09:35.909
I am so high right now.
Wait, was there a skunk in here?

09:40.121 --> 09:43.666
- What do you know about Nadia?
- Uh, who's Nadia?

09:43.750 --> 09:47.087
Your friend doing the face-down mambo
in the king-sized bathtub.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.715
- Now I know her name is Nadia.
- Oh, so you're a comedian, huh?

09:50.799 --> 09:53.176
Although I am trying to branch
into more serious roles.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.679
You pigs think you can march all over us.
But I know my rights.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.225
- Yeah, what are they?
- I mean, I don't <i>know them</i> know them.

10:00.308 --> 10:04.229
But I know that I have them.
So, can I check my phone real quick?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.189
You're not gonna look up your rights,
are you?

10:06.272 --> 10:07.398
What? No.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.733
I'm just supposed to moderate

10:08.817 --> 10:11.361
an Emily VanCamp live-chat talkback
on Snapchat.

10:11.444 --> 10:18.118
Let me just set up
the user preferences here, and...

10:18.201 --> 10:20.453
you can't detain us
unless we're under arrest.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.206
Damn it. You <i>were </i>looking up
your rights, weren't you?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.667
Nope, that was just a thing
I already knew.

10:25.750 --> 10:29.003
Everyone's stupid rights these days.
I never get to have any fun.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.507
- Let's get out of here.
- BoJack, I need to show you something.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.008
This is Nadia's phone.

10:34.092 --> 10:37.428
I did not know you were such a klepto.
I can buy you a new phone.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.639
Check this out,
the last text message she sent.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.599
"BoJack is going to kill me?"

10:41.683 --> 10:44.310
I think someone's trying to frame you,
for murder.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.565
Oh, my God, we're gonna be late
for the Bat Mitzvah.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.941
We got to get to Brentwood.

10:50.024 --> 10:53.403
At this time of day?
It's gonna be... murder.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.447

10:56.531 --> 10:58.700
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey. L'chaim ♪</i>
Hey!

10:58.783 --> 11:01.161
I can't believe
you're not more concerned about this.

11:01.244 --> 11:04.497
- Someone is implicating you in a murder.
- I can be two things at once.

11:04.581 --> 11:05.790
I am very concerned,

11:05.874 --> 11:08.877
but also very proud
that today Tovah is a woman.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.920
Hi, BoJack Horseman,
potential Oscar nominee.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.631
I am kvelling over here. Real verklempt.

11:13.715 --> 11:14.966
<i>Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom.</i>

11:15.049 --> 11:16.676
<i>- Shabbat shalom.</i>
<i>- Shabbat shalom</i> to you.

11:16.759 --> 11:20.388
We need to figure out who's behind this.
Call Jill, find out what she knows.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.472
Good thinking.

11:21.556 --> 11:24.976
If I go to jail, that will throw
a monkey wrench into my awards campaign.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.020
The Academy does not look kindly
on murder.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.855
Rape, they don't seem
to have a problem with.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.691
Be careful. Jill could be the one
trying to set you up.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.192
She did send us to the house.

11:33.276 --> 11:36.571
Backstrom, turn it down a notch.
Aren't you supposed to be tweeting for me?

11:36.654 --> 11:39.449
This is a crucial weekend
for BoJack brand awareness.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.493
What am I supposed to tweet?
"Someone got murdered, we found the body.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.246
- Hashtag murder party"?
- No, obviously.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.791
Bat Mitzvah in Brentwood.
Hashtag Jewish stuff.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.002
- <i>BoJack.</i>
- Hey, Jill.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.421
You're not trying to frame me
for murder, are you?

11:53.504 --> 11:55.340
<i>- What?</i>
- Can you take this seriously?

11:55.423 --> 11:56.883
Can you take <i>this </i>seriously?

11:56.966 --> 11:59.886
You find the letter? Check in the vent
behind the water feeder.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.513
I've been pretty tied up
at Drake's cousin's Bat Mitzvah.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.682
Did you know Drake's cousin was Jewish?

12:04.766 --> 12:07.852
I'm sorry, did I forget to hang up?
Get the letter.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.355
This is why I couldn't live in New York.
Everyone's so bossy.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.357
Also, what's with the pizza
by the slice thing?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.567
Hey, New York,
either eat a pizza or don't.

12:14.651 --> 12:17.779
I'm calling the last person
Nadia was in contact with before she died.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.072
Maybe she knows something.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.239
- <i> Nadia?</i>
- No, this is--

12:20.323 --> 12:23.743
<i>Where you been? Boys upstairs</i>
<i>are getting real sick of you.</i>

12:23.826 --> 12:26.245
<i>Get off the phone,</i>
<i>Skinny Gina. You're on the clock.</i>

12:26.329 --> 12:27.205
<i>I gotta go.</i>

12:27.288 --> 12:30.792
- That man's voice sounded familiar.
- Yeah, super familiar.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.087
Something about that voice
made me want to tell it to go home.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.130
- It's Goober.
- Goober.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.715
That guy never went home.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.634
Except for that one episode
"Goober Goes Home,"

12:39.717 --> 12:41.636
because we were
on a softball team together

12:41.719 --> 12:43.096
and the home was home plate.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.889
They must be at Whale World.

12:44.973 --> 12:48.309
Okay, good. Because I absolutely
want to get to the bottom of this.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.853
Can we at least wait
until after they lift the chair?

12:50.937 --> 12:53.398
- That is my favorite part.
- Yeah, we gotta lift the chair.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.443
Oh, I taste delicious.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.529
How you boys doing in there?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.115
- Ahh! I feel clean as a whistle.
- Oh, no, the stain.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.701
Me three.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.327
You took your bath together?

13:06.411 --> 13:10.915
Lena Dunham takes baths with her friends
and no one gives her shit.

13:10.999 --> 13:11.958
Gotta-- Gotta get dry.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.752
Mr. Peanutbutter, use the towel.
Do not shake.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.963
- The sauce is so sticky and wet.
- Don't shake.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.382
It's dripping all over my body.
I gotta shake!

13:19.465 --> 13:21.384
- Aaah!
- Aah!

13:21.467 --> 13:22.927
Oh, yeah.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.723
Oh, look, that made things worse.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.685
Okay, I'll call a cleaning service.
You two get rid of the stinky clothes.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.439
You got it, chief.
Hooray! Following instructions.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.820
Ooh.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.656
Fish half off at Beverly Hills
farmers market.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.616
Hashtag something fishy this way comes.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.786
You're not putting emojis in, are you?
BoJack don't tweet emojis.

13:48.870 --> 13:53.374
- BoJack? Oh, my God!
- Oh, hey... you.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.917
I haven't seen you in forever.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.837
- You came to see your old friend.
- Uh, yeah.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.631
All this time
I thought you forgot about me.

14:00.715 --> 14:03.509
Things haven't been so swell with me
since the show ended.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.596
- Not like you, Mr. Movie Star.
- Okay, buddy.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.389
Just knowing that you care about me

14:08.473 --> 14:11.059
and would come patronize
my place of business,

14:11.142 --> 14:13.227
- it really means a lot.
- You got it, Goober.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.688
Oh, no, I haven't been Goober
for 20 years.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.649
- You can call me by my real name.
- Okay, maybe I will.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.319
Right now, call me by my real name.
I want to hear you.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.528
Uh...

14:22.612 --> 14:27.367
I want to say Goo... bert.
Goobert?

14:27.450 --> 14:30.161
Oh, you didn't come to see me, did you?

14:30.244 --> 14:33.081
- No, we did, but--
- I get it. I'm a big joke.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.958
"Let's all go down to Whale World
and laugh at Goober.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.711
We'll have a whale of a good time
at Goober's expense.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.338
He's always good for a laugh."

14:40.421 --> 14:42.799
I should've known better
than to get my hopes up.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.716
Yeah.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.052
We're looking for one of your strippers,
Skinny Gina?

14:46.135 --> 14:50.098
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We don't employ strippers here.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.350
Whale World is a family establishment,

14:52.433 --> 14:55.478
where children of all ages
have a fun, sexy time.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.730
Hey, Skinny Gina,
get that sweet tail over here!

14:57.814 --> 15:00.274
You got a customer. You enjoy yourself.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.486
Well, hello, land mammals.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.280
We're just here to ask you some questions
about your friend Nadia.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.907
I'm on the clock. You want to chat?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.493
Buy me a private dance
in the Blowhole Room.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.871
- Oh, please.
- Ugh, gross. Private dance?

15:13.955 --> 15:16.457
But if that's the only way she'll talk,
then fine.

15:16.541 --> 15:17.792
Fine, I'm offended. Yuck.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.461
But really, guys, gross. Start it now.

15:20.545 --> 15:21.921
But gross.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.845
Oh, um, you can dance however
you want. Don't do this for my benefit.

15:28.928 --> 15:33.182
Tango, waltz, salsa.
I'm just saying, but pretend I'm not here.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.726
- How would you dance then?
- Like a stripper, probably.

15:35.810 --> 15:40.398
Listen, we have some bad news.
Your friend Nadia is dead.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.191
- Not surprised.
- You're not?

15:42.275 --> 15:45.736
A lot of girls like her come through here.
Sweet, vulnerable.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.990
This place takes 'em
and makes 'em a lot of promises.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.034
They say they're gonna take care of you,
make you big like Shamu.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.455
But once your body gets too banged up,
they don't want you no more.

15:55.538 --> 15:59.750
- Thar she blows, then thar she goes.
- Shit.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.794
Watch your mouth, lady.
There are children here.

16:01.878 --> 16:02.962
Uh...

16:03.045 --> 16:05.965
What do you know about Nadia's
relationship with Cuddlywhiskers?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.925
Doesn't ring a bell, never met the guy.

16:08.009 --> 16:11.220
His house has been abandoned
for months, though. That's all I know.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.972
- That's it?
- That's it.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.016
A bunch of girls used to hang out.

16:15.099 --> 16:18.186
He had some sort of system.
Told 'em he was gonna help 'em.

16:18.269 --> 16:21.147
- What do you mean, "system"?
- I have already said too much.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.774
A system is a formulated method
or plan of procedure.

16:23.858 --> 16:27.236
- I know what the word "system" means--
- But that's all I can say.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.781
That text that Nadia sent you,
"BoJack is going to kill me."

16:30.865 --> 16:32.033
Any idea what that's about?

16:32.116 --> 16:34.785
Hey, I don't know nothing about BoJack.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.996
How do you not know about BoJack?
I am very famous.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.247
Time's up.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.877
Hey, if you really want to know
about all that stuff,

16:42.960 --> 16:44.128
come by here real late.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.881
There's an after-hours party.
But that's all I can say.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.799
I'm not gonna spill any more beans.

16:48.883 --> 16:52.345
Say you got BoJack with you.
That'll get you in. Okay, that's it.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.848
Is Wilbur coming today?

16:55.932 --> 16:59.936
Wilbur's not real. He was a character
on a TV show you were on.

17:00.019 --> 17:04.899
- Oh. Are my kids coming today?
- Um...

17:04.982 --> 17:06.359
- No.
- Hey there, fella.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.278
Can't wait for you to see <i>Secretariat,</i>
think you're gonna love it.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.280
Hey, old pal.
Hope you remember how to vote.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.533
We have to go
to this Whale World party.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.952
I know I should go,
I'm invested in figuring out

17:16.035 --> 17:17.453
who's trying to frame me for murder.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.039
Are you sure you wanna go with me?
Outside of work hours?

17:20.122 --> 17:21.916
I wouldn't want to be unprofessional.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.584
Sorry about what I said.

17:23.668 --> 17:26.754
I was embarrassed by the person I was
when I was staying with you.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.381
I'm trying not to be that person.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.758
I make you unhappy?
Is that what you're saying?

17:30.841 --> 17:33.344
It's not about being happy.
That's the thing.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.429
I'm just trying to get through each day.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.848
I can't keep asking myself, "Am I happy?"

17:37.932 --> 17:39.350
It just makes me more miserable.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.978
Can I get a photo with the star?

17:42.061 --> 17:45.398
- Of course.
- Oh, thank you.

17:45.481 --> 17:49.360
I don't know if I believe in it,
real lasting happiness.

17:49.443 --> 17:53.281
All those perky, well-adjusted people
you see in movies and TV shows?

17:53.364 --> 17:56.284
- I don't think they exist.
- No one's happy all the time.

17:56.367 --> 17:59.161
- You have to focus on the small things.
- Right.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.414
- Like winning an Oscar.
- Right.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.000
Hey, old pal.
Look at this guy, still alive.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.793
Hope your voting finger works.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.632
- What happened out here?
- You told us to get rid of the clothes.

18:11.716 --> 18:15.261
Oh, we got rid of 'em, all right.
They're never coming back.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.640
You two are impossible.
Why did you even call me here?

18:19.724 --> 18:21.851
Because you're Princess Carolyn,
you can fix anything.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.937
That's true.
But you can't start a fire on your lawn.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.690
There's a drought and--
There's a drought.

18:27.773 --> 18:31.485
You, thoughtful husband that you are,
got rid of your lawn,

18:31.569 --> 18:34.697
and replaced it
with drought-resistant landscaping.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.991
This could work.
I got to make a few phone calls.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.743
Aw, thanks. You're the best.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.329
I tell you, I've got half a mind
to go over

18:41.412 --> 18:44.206
and give it to that skunk
for starting this whole darn thing.

18:44.290 --> 18:48.085
No. You go inside to your spot
and stay there while I fix this.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.630
- Yeah, but-- Right, but, um...
- Stay. Stay.

18:50.713 --> 18:51.756
Stay.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.759
Oh, my God.

18:54.842 --> 18:55.676
Ugh.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.262
- I, uh...
- Living the nightlife.

18:58.346 --> 19:01.849
Hashtag feeling good about myself
and my choices.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.481
Aah!

19:08.564 --> 19:09.690
Hey, look.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.071
Let's definitely follow that guy.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.909
- Ladies first.
- What a gentleman.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.411
Ohh.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.209
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.752
Ohh. Oh, my God.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.505

19:32.588 --> 19:33.589

BoJack kills?

19:35.132 --> 19:37.802
Something tells me that's not a reference
to your old stand-up act.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.428
Was that necessary?

19:39.512 --> 19:42.598
- What do you want?
- I'm with BoJack.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.100
Yeah? Let me see.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.228
- See what?
- Let me see some BoJack.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.146
Fine.

19:57.488 --> 20:00.157
- From the logo.
- Huh?

20:00.241 --> 20:04.704
BoJack, you didn't kill Nadia.
BoJack did.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.997
What?

20:07.081 --> 20:08.833
Nighty-night.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.131
Wakey, wakey.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.299
So, you got a little curious, huh?

20:17.383 --> 20:20.010
Thought you'd go sticking your little nose
where it doesn't belong?

20:20.094 --> 20:22.805
What's the play here?
Trying to get a cut of my smack biz?

20:22.888 --> 20:24.181
What? No, Goober.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.350
- You know my real name.
- I actually seriously don't.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.312
We just wanted to know why everyone
was talking about how BoJack kills?

20:30.396 --> 20:32.606
Why would you implicate me
in your drug business?

20:32.690 --> 20:34.108
Wait, I get what happened.

20:34.191 --> 20:37.361
You resented me all these years.
My fame, your obscurity.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.238
You made me the face of this drug,

20:39.321 --> 20:43.576
because to you my face is a symbol
for the opiate of show business.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.286
- No, man. You played The Horse.
- Huh?

20:45.369 --> 20:47.121
- Horse is a nickname for heroin.
- What?

20:47.204 --> 20:49.582
- BoJack. Horse. Heroin.
- Uh-huh. Uh...

20:49.665 --> 20:52.001
Oh-- Oh, okay. Yeah, right.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.295
- Police!
- Oh, God, not again.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.549
Gotcha!
Richie Osborne, you're under arrest.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.801
- Oh, right, Reggie.
- Richie.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.803
That's what I said. I said Rickie.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.680
Thank God. How did you find us?

21:04.764 --> 21:07.641
Your Twitter account is hooked up
to your phone's location services.

21:07.725 --> 21:10.311
We've been tracking you
through your tweets all night.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.271
Actually, I've been tracking you
all night.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.357
Lindsay, I said "we".
Do you need credit for everything?

21:15.441 --> 21:18.694
I would like credit for something.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.112
What do we know?

21:20.196 --> 21:22.698
Nadia was not murdered.
She died of a heroin overdose.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.826
No one tried to frame me.
All right, back in the Oscar race.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.328
Look out, Jurj Clooners.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.497
But something's still fishy
about this whole mess,

21:29.580 --> 21:32.833
- and it's not just the killer whales.
- Whales are mammals, Diane.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.878
- I said it's <i>not</i> the whales.
- You said it's not <i>just</i> the whales.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.130
There's more to this story.
What are we missing?

21:38.214 --> 21:41.425
Cuddlywhiskers. What was Nadia
doing in his backyard in the first place?

21:41.509 --> 21:43.469
What was this "system"?
And where is he now?

21:43.552 --> 21:46.347
Why was it so important to Jill
to get that letter back?

21:46.430 --> 21:49.391
Oh, yeah, the letter.
This mystery has too many things.

21:49.475 --> 21:53.270
I say we go back to the house and
finally get to the bottom of what's what.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.314
Oh, this is turning into a real caper.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.234
A real Jill Pill jail fail
killer whale caper.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.487
- You're doing 50 in a 35.
- Oh, God, you're right.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.113
I feel so alive.

22:05.616 --> 22:07.618
This letter is really graphic.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.621
It's all about their magical nights
up at the Ojai property.

22:10.704 --> 22:11.705
Ojai property?

22:11.789 --> 22:14.542
She wrote out the sounds.
What is a "sploink"?

22:14.625 --> 22:16.502
Did you know Cuddlywhiskers
had an Ojai property?

22:16.585 --> 22:18.754
Sure. He always loved
to disappear up there.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.173
After our show got canceled,
he went there for six months.

22:21.257 --> 22:25.302
It's funny, at the time no one knew
where he was and we got really worried.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.555
Anyway, wonder where he went this time.

22:28.806 --> 22:29.932
Oh, you know what?

22:31.809 --> 22:34.061
- I don't see him. Do you?
- Huh.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.772
- <i>I'm Terry Gross and this your ring tone.</i>
- Shit.

22:36.855 --> 22:37.773
Mr. Peanutbutter.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.858
- Diane, where the hell are you?
- Ojai.

22:39.942 --> 22:43.487
Oh, hi? You've been gone all night,
all you have to say is "Oh, hi?"

22:43.571 --> 22:46.782
I'm so sorry. BoJack and I
were trying to find a killer and--

22:46.865 --> 22:49.702
Oh, you're with BoJack still?
Well, that explains it. Of course.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.371
Mr. Peanutbutter,
I understand and affirm your feeling--

22:52.454 --> 22:54.331
I'm glad you're safe.
I was worried about you.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.959
- What I'm hearing you say is you were--
- No, stop.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.962
You have to call me.
It doesn't matter what's happening,

23:00.045 --> 23:02.006
doesn't matter
if it's the middle of the night.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.674
You can't keep doing this to me.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.760
I'm sorry. I'm coming home.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.430
I'm going back to bed.
We'll talk about this in the morning.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.267
- Everything okay?
- No.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.769
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.313
It's my fault.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.191
BoJack?

23:25.112 --> 23:26.196
Mmm.

23:26.280 --> 23:30.367
After <i>The BoJack Horseman Show</i>
fell apart, I got depressed a long time.

23:30.451 --> 23:33.329
Sure, I wrote a bunch of hit movies,
I made a ton of money,

23:33.412 --> 23:34.538
but it wasn't fulfilling.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.416
I remember when I won my Oscar,
standing up on that stage,

23:37.499 --> 23:38.917
looking at the statue and thought,

23:39.001 --> 23:41.211
"This is supposed to be
the happiest moment of my life."

23:41.295 --> 23:43.088
And I never felt more miserable.

23:43.172 --> 23:46.592
- Oh. Because you're sober?
- Because an Oscar is meaningless.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.845
It's all meaningless.
I dedicated myself to helping others.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.765
I turned my home into a halfway house
for troubled addicts.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.893
I had this system for recovery,
and it helped a lot of them,

23:55.976 --> 23:58.062
but even more slipped through the cracks.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.064
That, too, left me empty.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.232
Everyone was worried about you,
you know.

24:02.316 --> 24:05.319
You can't just disappear.
You really hurt a lot of people.

24:05.402 --> 24:08.614
Sometimes you need to take responsibility
for your own happiness.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.491
You don't think that's a little selfish?

24:10.574 --> 24:13.952
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm happy, for the first time in my life.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.537
I'm not gonna feel bad about it.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.999
It takes a long time to realize
how truly miserable you are,

24:19.083 --> 24:21.627
even longer to see
it doesn't have to be that way.

24:22.211 --> 24:27.883
Only after you give up everything
can you begin to find a way to be happy.

24:35.933 --> 24:39.061
Can you believe that guy?
What a nut, right?

24:39.144 --> 24:40.938
I just wanna go home.
