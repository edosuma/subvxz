GARRISON STEELE THREW UP

HE MUST HAVE MISSED YOU.

I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY

IT'S SO GALLANT
OF YOU TO LET ME STAY HERE

02:40.370 --> 02:43.830
I APPRECIATE IT
MORE THAN WORDS CAN EXPRESS.

02:43.870 --> 02:47.250

YOU KNOW,
IF YOU'D CALLED,
I COULD HAVE BOOKED A HOTEL.

02:58.630 --> 03:00.220
THERE'S NO NEED.
I-- I LIKE IT HERE.

03:00.260 --> 03:01.510
I MEANT FOR ME.

03:01.550 --> 03:02.890
I BROUGHT A GIFT.

03:02.930 --> 03:06.270
IT'S ALL THE WAY FROM THE
SOUTH OF FRANCE. RIGHT HERE.

03:08.430 --> 03:11.060
SO-- SO WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

03:11.100 --> 03:14.360
YOU NEED ME TO SIGN OVER
THE MOVIE RIGHTS FOR THE SPECIAL DETECTIVE  OR...

03:14.400 --> 03:17.030

BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.830

03:30.870 --> 03:32.960
WHAT'S WRONG.
YOU GET A BAD REVIEW?

03:33.000 --> 03:36.170
IGNORE HIM, GARRISON.
JUST TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

03:36.210 --> 03:42.260
IT'S THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.
TAMARA. SHE'S GONE MISSING.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.390
YOU LOVE, LIKE, A HUMAN?

03:44.430 --> 03:45.470
JAKE.

03:45.510 --> 03:50.480
FRIEND TO FRIEND.
MAN TO MAN. I NEED YOUR HELP.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.270
GIVE US A MINUTE, GARRISON.

03:53.770 --> 03:57.280
HE'S IN ROUGH SHAPE HERE.
BE A MAN. LET'S HELP HIM.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.780
WHY DON'T YOU HELP HIM
YOURSELF?

03:58.820 --> 03:59.860
&lt;THUD&gt;

04:01.990 --> 04:03.820
I THINK THIS MIGHT BE A
TWO-MAN JOB.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.540
SO, TINNY. YOU'RE SICK.
I CALLED SCHOOL.

04:12.580 --> 04:13.790
YOU'VE GOT A FEVER.

04:13.830 --> 04:15.040
REALLY? THAT CAME ON FAST.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.380
IT'S NOT CONTAGIOUS, IS IT?

04:16.420 --> 04:17.670
MOM, I WANNA HANG, I DO,

04:17.710 --> 04:19.760
BUT I GOT THIS BIG TEST
COMING UP...

04:19.800 --> 04:21.340
UH, I'M GONNA GO WAIT IN
THE CAR.

04:21.380 --> 04:23.180
BABY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:23.220 --> 04:28.220
WE NEED SOME CATCH-UP TIME,
AND WHO IS GOING TO HELP ME
PUT ALL MY STUFF AWAY?

04:28.260 --> 04:30.270
OKAY, FINE.

04:30.310 --> 04:32.940
I'M GONNA GO GRAB A SHOWER.

04:35.350 --> 04:36.400
SO WHAT'S WITH BUDDY?

04:36.440 --> 04:38.480
AND WHY DOESN'T HE WEAR ANY
CLOTHES?

04:38.520 --> 04:42.860
HE'S JUST A FRIEND, BABY.
IT'S COOL.
HE'S GONNA HANG WITH US TODAY.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.240
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL.

04:49.290 --> 04:53.290
THIS TEST IS HUGE, AND I HAVE
SO MUCH TO CATCH UP ON.

04:53.330 --> 04:55.460
HAVE FUN WITH
NAKED NEWS THOUGH.

05:00.420 --> 05:04.340
SO, UP AHEAD IS WHERE
MY LOVELY TARA LIVES.

05:04.380 --> 05:05.340
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

05:05.380 --> 05:08.100
TARA? I THOUGHT YOU SAID HER
NAME WAS TAMARA.

05:08.140 --> 05:10.100
TAMARA, OF COURSE.
IT MUST BE THE STRESS.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.890
WHAT COLOR ARE TAMARA'S EYES?

05:11.930 --> 05:13.480
I-- I BELIEVE THEY HAVE
A JADE HUE.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.480
HMM...

05:14.520 --> 05:17.230
AND WHERE DID YOU TWO MEET?

05:17.270 --> 05:19.650
THE LAST TIME I WAS
HERE IN TOWN.

05:19.690 --> 05:21.400
RIGHT.
WHAT'S HER BEST FRIEND'S NAME?

05:21.440 --> 05:22.400
HER FAVORITE COLOR?
HER FAVORITE FOOD?

05:22.440 --> 05:24.450
-HER FAVORITE PERFUME?
-GARRISON?

05:24.490 --> 05:28.320
WELL... WE DIDN'T TALK A LOT
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.370
YOU KNOW, I AM SMART
ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN I'M BEING

05:30.410 --> 05:33.790
PLAYED BY A...
ALCOHOLIC HACK BUFFOON.

05:33.830 --> 05:38.170
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
YOU ARE SUCH A GOOD DETECTIVE.

05:38.210 --> 05:39.380
IT'S ALL ABOUT A BOOK.

05:39.420 --> 05:42.050
-REALLY?
-THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE?
A BOOK?

05:42.090 --> 05:45.010
I NEED A BOOK, AND
THE SPECIAL DETECTIVE  SERIES

05:45.050 --> 05:46.180
IS A GUARANTEED HIT.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.430
AND, WELL I WANTED...

05:47.470 --> 05:50.010
I'M IN A BIT OF A
PICKLE AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.470
WAIT, WAIT, PLEASE!
I'M ON BENDED KNEE.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.980
I IMPLORE YOU.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.600
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, WHEN
SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE ON
"BENDED KNEE",

05:57.650 --> 05:59.060
THEY USUALLY,
ACTUALLY KNEEL DOWN.

05:59.110 --> 06:01.230
WELL, UH, MY KNEES
AREN'T SO GOOD.

06:01.270 --> 06:03.150
TAMARA BOWLER. SHE'S
ACCUSED OF STEALING FROM THE

06:03.190 --> 06:05.780
DANISH CONSULATE, WHERE SHE
WORKS AS AN ASSISTANT.

06:05.820 --> 06:08.570
SHE'S UNDER HOUSE ARREST
UNTIL THEY TRY HER IN DENMARK.

06:08.610 --> 06:11.450
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A TERRIBLE
IDEA FOR A NOVEL,
EVEN FOR YOU!

06:11.490 --> 06:15.000
I'LL JUST CALL IT
SOMETHING LIKE, THE AMBASSADOR TO MURDER,

06:15.040 --> 06:17.330
AND IT'LL SELL LIKE HOTCAKES.

06:17.670 --> 06:19.920
&lt;SIGH&gt;

06:19.960 --> 06:21.460
HOW MUCH ARE WE GETTING PAID?

06:21.500 --> 06:24.670
I'LL GIVE YOU A CUT
OF THE PROFITS.

06:29.140 --> 06:32.140
MALACHY.

06:32.180 --> 06:34.810
PLEASE DO NOT BE
INTIMIDATED BY MY
PRESENCE HERE.

06:34.850 --> 06:38.730
JUST PRETEND YOU'RE A
CHARACTER IN ONE OF MY NOVELS.

06:38.770 --> 06:40.150
WHO ARE YOU?

06:40.190 --> 06:42.860
I'M STARTING TO LIKE THIS
GIRL ALREADY.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.150
NOT A FAN OF THE
MYSTERY OEUVRE?

06:45.190 --> 06:47.610
NO. ACTUALLY, MYSTERIES
ARE MY FAVORITE.
HE'S A WRITER.

06:47.650 --> 06:50.240
I-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU SAID YOU WERE
INVESTIGATORS,

06:50.280 --> 06:52.870
THAT YOU COULD HELP ME WITH MY
LEGAL PROBLEMS.

06:52.910 --> 06:56.540
YEAH, IT'S WHAT YOU'D
CALL COMPLICATED.

06:56.580 --> 07:00.000
UH, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
START BY TELLING US WHAT
HAPPENED.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.960
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY.
I'M INNOCENT AND THEY'RE
USING ME AS A SCAPEGOAT.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.090
WHO IS?

07:05.130 --> 07:06.960
THE EMBASSY. IT'S LUDICROUS.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.970
WHAT ARE YOU ACCUSED OF
STEALING EXACTLY?

07:09.010 --> 07:11.550
NO IDEA. HONESTLY.

07:11.590 --> 07:14.180
EITHER WAY,
THE POLICE THINK I DO,
AND NOW I'M SADDLED WITH THIS.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.270
FLAWLESS SKIN?

07:17.100 --> 07:18.520
I'M SORRY?

07:18.560 --> 07:21.600
IGNORE HIM. IT'S KIND OF
HIS COURTING RITUAL.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.480
WE'RE DONE HERE. GOODBYE.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.610
STEELE! WE JUST STARTED
TALKING TO HER.

07:25.650 --> 07:29.490
GENIUS. IT'S IN THE
MIND, NOT IN THE MOUTH, AND

07:29.530 --> 07:31.530
SOLUTION COMES FROM WITHIN,

07:31.570 --> 07:35.660
NOT FROM...
MAY I PLEASE USE YOUR
WASHROOM?

07:35.700 --> 07:38.540
OH, OF COURSE. UH, DOWN
THE HALL AND TO THE LEFT.

07:38.580 --> 07:40.580
THANK YOU.

07:40.620 --> 07:44.040
I HAVE TO SAY, I'M NOT
SURE HOW YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING ME.

07:44.090 --> 07:46.250
IS THIS NORMALLY HOW
YOUR INVESTIGATIONS WORK?

07:46.300 --> 07:48.010
-NO.
-&lt;DOOR BELL&gt;

07:48.050 --> 07:50.170
WHO IS THAT NOW? EXCUSE ME.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.680
HE'S A MESS.
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT HERE.

07:55.720 --> 07:56.600
YEAH, IT'S CALLED WHISKEY.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.470
LOOK, GO CHECK ON HIM
BEFORE HE PASSES OUT.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.930
I'LL DISTRACT TAMARA.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.560
DISTRACT HER FROM WHAT?

08:01.600 --> 08:03.650
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

08:03.690 --> 08:07.730
STEELE, WHY DO YOU HAVE A
PAIR OF UNDERWEAR STICKING OUT
OF YOUR POCKET?

08:07.780 --> 08:09.530
PANTIES? IMPOSSIBLE.

08:09.570 --> 08:10.820
-I HATE THAT WORD.
- PANTIES!

08:10.860 --> 08:12.450
SHH!

08:12.490 --> 08:14.160
OH, IT MUST BE RESEARCH.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.910
IT HELPS DEVELOP THE
CHARACTER WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT

08:16.950 --> 08:19.830
THEY WEAR AT THE MOST INTIMATE
MOMENTS.

08:19.870 --> 08:23.620
TO BE HONEST, I'M
ACTUALLY STARTING TO
WORRY ABOUT YOU HERE.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.590
[TAMARA] LET GO OF ME!
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.040
[MAL]
HEY, TAKE IT EASY, BUDDY.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.840
[GERHARDT] COME ON,
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAD THE--

08:29.880 --> 08:34.800
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE
OR WHAT YOU HAVE TO
DO WITH THIS, SO BACK OFF!

08:34.840 --> 08:37.890
&lt;SCREAM&gt;
&lt;CRASH&gt;

08:37.930 --> 08:40.060
I WILL FIND WHAT YOU TOOK.
ALL RIGHT?

08:40.640 --> 08:42.520
&lt;CLICK&gt;

08:42.560 --> 08:45.690
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE VASE.
IT WAS, YOU KNOW, THE ONLY
THING I COULD FIND.

08:45.730 --> 08:47.900
BYE.

08:47.940 --> 08:49.610
YOU ALL RIGHT, SKIPPER?

08:49.650 --> 08:52.570
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU PEOPLE WANT FROM ME, BUT
I THINK IT'S TIME YOU LEFT.

08:52.610 --> 08:55.620
HE DROPPED THIS.
IT'S A COCKTAIL RECEPTION

08:55.660 --> 08:57.990
AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE
FOR THE DANISH CONSULATE.

08:58.030 --> 09:00.120
I'M VERY BIG IN DENMARK.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.200
ARE THOSE MY PANTIES?

09:02.250 --> 09:06.580
LEOPARD PRINT SAYS A
LOT ABOUT A WOMAN.

09:07.250 --> 09:10.420
GET OUT! OUT!

09:14.510 --> 09:16.340
SO, THIS INVITE ONLY
ADMITS ONE.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.850
SO IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT
MORE ABOUT THE GUY WHO

09:17.890 --> 09:21.430
SMASHED A VASE OVER
MALACHY'S HEAD, I WAS THINKING
YOU'LL NEED MORE INVITES.

09:21.470 --> 09:23.020
-GOOD JOB.
-OH, THANKS.

09:23.060 --> 09:25.770
THANKS. MOST OF IT WAS
PHOTOSHOP, BUT THE
HOLOGRAM WAS REALLY HARD.

09:25.810 --> 09:27.730
I ACTUALLY USED
OLD HOCKEY CARDS,

09:27.770 --> 09:30.980
BUT I FOUND A
TERRY RYAN ROOKIE IN THERE,
WHICH I REALLY, REALLY NEEDED.

09:31.030 --> 09:33.070
THAT'S PRETTY SMART, HUH?

09:33.780 --> 09:35.820
YEAH.

09:35.860 --> 09:39.200
"YOUNG AND INDUSTRIOUS DES
BEAMS WITH APPROVAL FROM HIS

09:39.240 --> 09:41.160
"GREAT FRIEND AND MENTOR,

09:41.200 --> 09:43.750
"JAKE DOYLE."

09:43.790 --> 09:46.960
SO, I WAS THINKING, IF YOU
NEED A PLUS-ONE,
I'M MORE THAN AVAILABLE.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.710
-SURE, WE'LL KEEP YOU IN MIND.
-EXCELLENT.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.800
-ROSE, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
-TAMARA HERE IS ACCUSED OF

09:51.840 --> 09:54.340
STEALING AN UNKNOWN ITEM
OUT OF A DIPLOMATIC POUCH.

09:54.380 --> 09:55.630
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

09:55.670 --> 09:57.470
IT'S PRONOUNCED "POOCH".

09:57.510 --> 09:59.260
SO THIS WHOLE THING WAS
ABOUT A DOG.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.970
NO DES, IT'S A PACKAGE
THAT DIPLOMATS CAN SEND INTO
THE COUNTRY WITHOUT

10:03.020 --> 10:04.770
HAVING IT SEARCHED
OR CHECKED THROUGH
CUSTOMS.

10:04.810 --> 10:06.440
&lt;YAWN&gt;

10:06.480 --> 10:08.310
ARE WE KEEPING YOU UP
THERE, COCKY, OR WHAT?

10:08.350 --> 10:11.610
TV DID. VOLUME ON BUST
APPARENTLY. SORRY.

10:11.650 --> 10:14.440
YEAH, KATHLEEN LIKES IT LOUD.

10:14.490 --> 10:15.740
SHE LIKES THE TV LOUD.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.820
TAMARA COULD HAVE TAKEN
ANYTHING FROM THAT POUCH.

10:17.860 --> 10:20.830
GUNS, MONEY, DRUGS, ANYTHING.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.240
SO WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY?
ANYTHING ON HIM?

10:23.290 --> 10:24.620
NO, NOTHING YET.

10:24.660 --> 10:28.420
STEELE... GIVE ME THIS.

10:28.460 --> 10:32.460
THE MYSTERY MAN. DO YOU KNOW
HIM? YOU DUCKED THE MINUTE
YOU LAID EYES ON HIM.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.300
I WAS SIMPLY MOVING TO A
MORE ADVANTAGEOUS PLACE TO

10:35.340 --> 10:38.510
RECORD HIS MOVEMENTS
FOR MY ART.

10:38.550 --> 10:39.840
UNDER THE CHESTERFIELD.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.560
NO, I'VE NEVER SEEN
HIM BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.970
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO
THIS DANISH COCKTAIL THING

10:45.020 --> 10:46.930
IF WE'RE GONNA ASK THE
MYSTERY MAN ANY QUESTIONS.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.020
HOPE YOU PACKED YOUR TUX,
GARRISON.

10:49.060 --> 10:50.690
OF COURSE I DID.
DO YOU THINK I'M AN ANIMAL?

10:50.730 --> 10:52.650
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

10:54.820 --> 10:56.240
[ALL] NIKKI?

10:56.280 --> 10:59.910
I THINK WE SHOULD STAKE
OUT TAMARA HERE,
SEE WHO'S COMING AND GOING.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.620
UH, JAKE YOU'RE WITH GARRISON.
ROSE, YOU'RE WITH ME.

11:02.660 --> 11:03.740
YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

11:03.780 --> 11:06.910
EXCELLENT PLAN,
DESERVES A TOAST.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.460
&lt;PARTY CHATTER&gt;

11:24.560 --> 11:25.810
LESLIE.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.390
-JAKE. HI.
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:28.430 --> 11:30.690
CAN'T A GIRL GO OUT
WITHOUT HAVING TO GET YOUR
PERMISSION?

11:30.730 --> 11:32.860
RELAX, B'Y.
IT WAS A SIMPLE QUESTION.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.320
YEAH, AND I GAVE YOU A
SIMPLE ANSWER.
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.610
&lt;SCOFFS&gt;

11:37.650 --> 11:42.200
SO ARE YOU ALONE,
ARE YOU HERE WITH SOMEONE,
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMEONE?

11:42.240 --> 11:44.780
I'VE GOT MY GUN, JAKE.
DON'T PUSH ME.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.750
WELL... I MEAN, I HAVE NO
IDEA WHERE YOU COULD HAVE THAT
GUN STASHED,

11:47.790 --> 11:50.920
BUT WHEREVER IT IS,
IT'S A VERY LUCKY FIREARM.

11:54.540 --> 12:00.010
OH, I GET IT. YOU'RE HERE WITH
BUDDY. I GUESS YOU'RE INTO
THE TALLER,

12:00.050 --> 12:01.510
BETTER-LOOKING-THAN-ME TYPE.

12:01.550 --> 12:04.090
-GOODBYE, JAKE.
-NO, NO, WAIT. LESLIE,

12:04.140 --> 12:05.760
PLEASE.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.180
YOU LOOK SPECTACULAR.

12:08.220 --> 12:09.600
LOOK, WHATEVER.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.560
COME HERE TO ME.

12:11.600 --> 12:16.730
MY DAD TAUGHT ME HOW
TO TIE ONE OF THESE, IN CASE
MY HUSBAND NEEDED IT.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.730
HIS WORDS.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.570
SO ARE YOU IN THE MARKET?

12:20.610 --> 12:22.990
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T
NOTICED, OR YOU'RE UNABLE TO

12:23.030 --> 12:28.830
READ THE SIGNS, I'M HERE ON A
DATE WITH ANOTHER MAN,

12:28.870 --> 12:32.500
WHO ISN'T YOU.
IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH FOR YOU?

12:32.540 --> 12:34.420
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO
MARRY ME, THEN?

12:34.460 --> 12:38.710
NIKKI! NIKKI, HELLO.
LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

12:38.750 --> 12:42.630
STEELE, SHUT UP.
THIS IS LESLIE.
YOU TWO HAVE ALREADY MET.

12:43.880 --> 12:47.050
-A FEW TIMES. HI.
-OF COURSE IT'S LESLIE.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.350
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN FROM
THE LONGING IN HER EYES
FOR YOU.

12:51.390 --> 12:55.060
OH MY, IT'S SO TRANSPARENT.
IT'S ALMOST SHOCKING REALLY.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.190
NOT LIKELY.

12:57.230 --> 13:00.690
WELL, IF YOU NEED ANY
HELP REMOVING THAT DRESS
LATER ON,

13:00.730 --> 13:03.150
I HAVE A FREE HAND. OR TWO.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.780
STEELE! LOOK,
I'M-- I'M SORRY ABOUT HIM.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.490
I'LL SEE YOU AND, UH,

13:08.530 --> 13:11.540
YOUR NEW WING MAN LATER.

13:11.580 --> 13:12.960
ENCHANTE.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.580
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

13:16.630 --> 13:18.920
PLEASE EXCUSE MY LACK OF TACT.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.420
I'VE HAD A HARROWING
TIME IN DENMARK,

13:21.460 --> 13:24.220
AND I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN RATHER SUSCEPTIBLE
TO JETLAG.

13:24.260 --> 13:28.100
DENMARK? WHAT IS THIS DENMARK?
YOU TOLD ME YOU
TRAVELED FROM FRANCE.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.260
YOU'RE DRUNK!

13:29.310 --> 13:30.720
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

13:32.730 --> 13:35.020
HELLO? OH,
IT HAS BEEN TOO LONG.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.350
ANYWAYS, HE'S RIGHT HERE.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.070
NIKKI. FIRST LESLIE,
AND NOW THE EX-WIFE.

13:40.110 --> 13:45.860
OH, JAKEY BOY, YOUR CLOSET
DOOR IS WIDE OPEN TONIGHT.

13:45.900 --> 13:49.120
-WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE MY
PHONE?
-HA!

13:49.160 --> 13:51.540
-HI.
-YOU'RE AVOIDING ME, JAKE.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.910
YEAH, I AM, ACTUALLY.

13:53.950 --> 13:57.290
WE NEED TO TALK,
DON'T YOU THINK?
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

13:57.330 --> 13:59.880
YEAH, OR WE COULD TRY NOT
TALKING FOR ONCE, YOU KNOW?

13:59.920 --> 14:02.880
-WE COULD JUST DO IT
OVER TEXTS.
-JAKE!

14:02.920 --> 14:06.510
I KNOW. YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING
RIGHT NOW. CAN WE TALK LATER?

14:06.550 --> 14:08.680
-OKAY, FINE. I'LL CALL YOU.
-ALL RIGHT.

14:12.180 --> 14:13.470
SO I--

14:13.520 --> 14:18.940
I TELL THEM ALL THEY CAN SUCK
IT. AND THEY DIDN'T! HA!

14:18.980 --> 14:21.070
WHERE'S SHE GOING?

14:21.110 --> 14:26.650
HEADS UP, STEELE. THERE'S
OUR MYSTERY MAN FROM TAMARA'S.

14:27.530 --> 14:29.990
- GOOD AFTERNOON!
-&lt;CLINKING&gt;

14:30.030 --> 14:31.910
QUIET. QUIET PLEASE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

14:31.950 --> 14:35.540
HELLO. HELLO.
I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR

14:35.580 --> 14:38.870
THROWING THIS PARTY AS A
LAUNCH FOR MY NEWEST NOVEL IN

14:38.920 --> 14:42.090
THE SPECIAL DETECTIVE  SERIES.

14:42.130 --> 14:45.460
THE DETECTIVE WITH THE...
NOSE.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.510
GIVE YOURSELVES A
ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

14:47.550 --> 14:49.340
-&lt;CLINK&gt;
-WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

14:49.390 --> 14:53.680
OH! AS YOU KNOW, MY
MUSE IS HERE WITH ME TODAY.

14:53.720 --> 15:00.270
THE ORIGINAL SPECIAL
DETECTIVE, JARED BOYLE!

15:00.310 --> 15:03.070
THEY'RE CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.940
WAIT... THAT MAN.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.570
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
IS THAT A BOMB?

15:07.610 --> 15:09.030
-WHAT?
-WHAT!

15:09.070 --> 15:11.070
SECURITY, THAT MAN HAS A BOMB!
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

15:11.120 --> 15:11.990
&lt;COMMOTION&gt;

15:12.030 --> 15:13.120
I HAVEN'T GOT A BOMB!

15:13.160 --> 15:14.870
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

15:14.910 --> 15:19.870
OBVIOUSLY A FAN. YOU
CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE SICKOS

15:19.920 --> 15:21.960
I HAVE GLOM ONTO ME AS A

15:22.000 --> 15:28.260
CELEBRITY, THAT I AM. UH, WHAT
WAS I SAYING?

15:28.300 --> 15:30.050
YOU'RE WONDERFUL.

15:30.090 --> 15:32.470
GOOD NIGHT.

15:34.810 --> 15:38.350
MY APOLOGIES.
HE'S JUST A HACK...
DRUNK WRITER.

15:38.390 --> 15:41.440
-WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
-YOU.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.060
&lt;VOMITING&gt;

15:43.110 --> 15:45.150
YOU KNOW, STEELE, THIS IS
ALL GETTING A BIT
HARD TO TAKE,

15:45.190 --> 15:49.030
AND TO BE QUITE FRANK, I'M
LOSING MY PATIENCE. WHAT THE
HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?

15:49.700 --> 15:51.160
BIRD FLU.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.870
I HAVE BEEN WAKING UP
WITH ACHES IN THE MORNING.

15:54.910 --> 16:00.580
OKAY STEELE. IF YOU WANT
MY HELP, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
START BEING HONEST WITH ME.

16:00.620 --> 16:02.290
I AM BEING HONEST WITH YOU.

16:02.330 --> 16:06.090
REALLY? YOUR NOTEBOOK HAS
NO NOTES IN IT, WHICH MEANS
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT REALLY

16:06.130 --> 16:08.090
WRITING A BOOK.

16:09.550 --> 16:11.340
-I'M SORRY JAKE.
-&lt;CAR ENGINE&gt;

16:12.340 --> 16:15.140
OH, DEAR GOD.

16:15.180 --> 16:16.390
-YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.
-&lt;DOORS SLAMMING&gt;

16:16.430 --> 16:18.680
-STEELE.
-&lt;DOOR SLAMMING&gt;

16:18.720 --> 16:20.600
WHO THE HELL IS THIS NOW?

16:20.640 --> 16:23.230
YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
WHO I AM, MY FRIEND.
MY CONCERN IS WHO ARE YOU?

16:23.270 --> 16:25.110
HOW THE HELL DID YOU FIND ME?

16:25.150 --> 16:29.360
EASY. I TOLD THE PEOPLE
AT THE AIRPORT I WAS LOOKING
FOR A SLIMY, MEATHEAD WRITER.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.530
THEY DREW ME A MAP.

16:30.570 --> 16:32.910
THAT IS ACTUALLY, UH,
PRETTY FUNNY.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.030
-&lt;WHACK&gt;
-OW!

16:35.070 --> 16:36.490
I WANT WHAT YOU OWE ME,
STEELE.

16:36.530 --> 16:40.660
WHAT HE OWES - OW!
WHAT HE OWES YOU?
WHAT DOES HE OWE YOU?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.040
YOU OWE SOMETHING TO EVERYONE.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.460
-&lt;WHACK&gt;
-OW!

16:43.500 --> 16:46.630
-&lt;WHACK&gt;
-OW! STOP HITTING ME!

16:46.670 --> 16:48.300
THIS AIN'T OVER, STEELE.
I'M GETTING TIRED OF

16:48.340 --> 16:51.840
CHASING YOU AROUND FOR WHAT
WE BOTH KNOW IS RIGHTFULLY
MINE. COME ON, SWEETS.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.050
-ENCHANTE.
-&lt;WHACK&gt;

16:58.350 --> 17:01.100
THIS IS NOT HOW
I PICTURED MY LIFE.

17:03.270 --> 17:05.900
ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD.

17:05.940 --> 17:08.860
OKAY, I'M NO EXPERT,
BUT I THINK HE'S
GONNA BE FINE.

17:08.900 --> 17:11.440
SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE HIM TO
A DOCTOR THOUGH,
TAKE HIM TO NIKKI.

17:11.490 --> 17:15.160
YEAH, NOT LIKELY. LISTEN
I APPRECIATE YOU DOING THIS.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.070
I MEAN, I HOPE I DIDN'T
RUIN YOUR NIGHT.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.620
EH, IT'S FINE.

17:18.660 --> 17:21.250
GOOD TO SEE YA.

17:21.290 --> 17:25.790
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.
BUT I DO HAVE ONE
QUESTION THOUGH.

17:25.830 --> 17:27.290
HERE WE GO.

17:27.330 --> 17:29.710
WHAT, KATH, NOW
DON'T BE LIKE THAT. ALL RIGHT?
I'M JUST SAYING,

17:29.750 --> 17:32.970
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOW UP HERE
WITHOUT EVEN A PHONE CALL, AND

17:33.010 --> 17:35.970
-THEN YOU INVITE SOME BUM TO
MOVE INTO THE HOUSE--
-YOU KNOW, JAKE, THIS

17:36.010 --> 17:37.510
IS SO NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,

17:37.550 --> 17:41.270
OKAY? AND HE'S NOT A BUM.
SO YOU DON'T JUDGE ME,
AND I'LL LAY OFF JUDGING YOU.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.100
WELL, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GIVE
THE OLD MAN A HEART ATTACK,
YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB.

17:44.140 --> 17:46.440
JAKE!

17:46.480 --> 17:48.690
REMEMBER, I KNOW EVERYONE
YOU'VE EVER DATED.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.110
YOU'RE NOT A PRINCE.

17:50.150 --> 17:51.570
SO JUST DROP IT.

17:51.610 --> 17:54.240
-FINE.
-OKAY. I'M OFF.

17:56.070 --> 17:57.700
IF YOU'RE AROUND LATER,
CALL ME.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.870
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

17:59.910 --> 18:01.580
YEAH. YOU TOO.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.170
WHO WAS THE GUY WHO TRIED
TO REARRANGE YOUR FACE?

18:11.210 --> 18:14.130
PROBABLY A NEW
BOYFRIEND OF ONE OF
MY EX-WIVES

18:14.170 --> 18:16.260
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.970
STEELE, WHY SHOULD I
BELIEVE A WORD THAT YOU'RE

18:21.010 --> 18:24.270
SAYING? ALL RIGHT? YOU'VE BEEN
LYING TO ME FROM THE START.

18:24.310 --> 18:26.810
&lt;CRYING&gt;

18:27.850 --> 18:30.310
I'M SORRY.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.770
I HAVE REAL TROUBLE,

18:31.820 --> 18:34.440
SERIOUS TROUBLE WITH SOME
SERIOUS PEOPLE.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.280
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

18:36.320 --> 18:38.360
NIKKI AGAIN? YOU
KNOW, IF YOU WANT MY ADVICE--

18:38.410 --> 18:40.620
I DO NOT WANT YOUR ADVICE.
AT ALL.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.330
CLEARLY.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.830
-SO ARE YOU OKAY?
-I FEEL TERRIBLE, JAKE.

18:44.870 --> 18:47.460
I-- I DO. OBVIOUSLY.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.330
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT
TO DAVID.

18:54.090 --> 18:55.880
&lt;SLAP&gt;

18:58.300 --> 19:01.220
WAS THAT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY?

19:01.260 --> 19:05.310
SO, HMM? YOU REALLY
THINK THAT WOULD WORK,

19:05.350 --> 19:06.890
GETTING ME THROWN OUT
LIKE THAT?

19:06.930 --> 19:10.850
GERHARDT, IT'S SO GOOD TO
SEE YOU, BUT I DID YOU A
FAVOR. IT WAS AN AWFUL PARTY.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.650
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN
ST. JOHN'S?

19:12.690 --> 19:15.150
I CAME TO HELP YOU.

19:15.190 --> 19:17.240
-I KNOW PEOPLE--
-NO, NO, NO.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.990
I DON'T WANT HELP.
I WANT MY MONEY. YEAH?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.990
YOU HAVE UNTIL TOMORROW.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.540
I'M GOOD FOR IT.

19:25.580 --> 19:27.960
YOU'D BETTER BE.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.210
OH, AND STAY OUT OF
MY BUSINESS WITH TAMARA,
ALL RIGHT?

19:31.250 --> 19:33.540
-OH, ABSOLUTELY.
YES, OF COURSE.
-YOU KNOW...

19:34.170 --> 19:36.170
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

19:36.210 --> 19:38.090
YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE THIS,
BUT, UM,

19:38.130 --> 19:39.840
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
A WRITER AS WELL.

19:39.880 --> 19:44.430
-REALLY, THAT'S FASCINATING.
-MMM. YOU KNOW, IF WE
ACTUALLY GET THROUGH THIS,

19:44.470 --> 19:46.600
YOU KNOW, IF I DON'T END UP
HAVING TO KILL YOU, I'D,

19:46.640 --> 19:48.020
UH... WELL,

19:48.060 --> 19:50.520
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
READING SOME OF MY STUFF.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.230
WELL, UH,
BOY, I'D LOVE TO, BUT

19:52.270 --> 19:53.860
MY LAWYERS DON'T USUALLY
LIKE ME READING--

19:53.900 --> 19:55.570
NO, NO, NO, NO. NO,
NO, YOU'LL READ IT.

19:55.610 --> 20:00.070
YOU'LL READ IT.
AND, AND, AND I DON'T WANT
ANY FALSE PRAISE, YOU KNOW?

20:00.110 --> 20:03.570
I WANT, I WANT WHAT YOU THINK,
TRUTHFULLY, YEAH?

20:03.620 --> 20:06.580
I THINK-- I THINK WE
CAN ABSOLUTELY ARRANGE
SOMETHING. ABSOLUTELY.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.370
ALL RIGHT.

20:09.410 --> 20:11.620
SO TOMORROW, STEELE.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.500
MY MONEY OR YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.750
&lt;BAR CHATTER&gt;

20:24.590 --> 20:25.930
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

20:25.970 --> 20:28.720
LET'S HOOK UP LATER AND
WE'LL... I MEAN, WE'LL TALK.

20:28.770 --> 20:31.690
WE'RE NOT GONNA HOOK UP.
OKAY? I DON'T MEAN LET'S
HOOK UP LATER,

20:31.730 --> 20:33.600
I MEAN LET'S TALK. LATER.

20:33.650 --> 20:37.440
OKAY, OKAY.
BUT SHOULD I TELL DAVID?

20:37.480 --> 20:42.740
NO. I WOULD DEFINITELY
PUT A PIN IN THAT. FOR NOW.

20:42.780 --> 20:45.820
OKAY, FINE.
WELL, I-- I'M ON THE NIGHT
SHIFT SO I HAVE TO GO.

20:46.530 --> 20:48.290
OKAY. GOOD NIGHT.

21:01.840 --> 21:04.220
YOU SON OF A--!

21:07.470 --> 21:09.390
[MAL] SO, YOU LOST HIM.

21:09.430 --> 21:12.020
AND HE STOLE MY
FRIGGIN' WALLET.

21:12.060 --> 21:17.940
THOSE ARE STEELE'S FLIGHT
ITINERARIES. HE FLEW FIRST
CLASS FROM NEW YORK TO PARIS,

21:17.980 --> 21:20.650
EXECUTIVE FIRST CLASS FROM
PARIS TO COPENHAGEN--

21:20.690 --> 21:23.400
OKAY, ARE YOU JUST RUBBING IN
THE FACT THAT HE
STOLE MY CREDIT CARDS OR WHAT?

21:23.450 --> 21:24.650
NO, THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.370
HE FLEW DISCOUNT ECONOMY
FROM DENMARK TO ST. JOHN'S.

21:27.410 --> 21:30.410
DISCOUNT?
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE GARRISON.

21:31.370 --> 21:33.870
HE'S BROKE.

21:33.910 --> 21:37.290
DIDN'T TAMARA SAY THAT
SHE WORKED AT THE
DANISH CONSULATE?

21:37.330 --> 21:39.340
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING
WENT DOWN IN DENMARK.

21:39.380 --> 21:41.130
YEAH, BUT WHAT?

21:41.170 --> 21:43.590
LET'S FIND STEELE AND ASK HIM.

21:43.630 --> 21:47.470
SO THAT'S PRETTY COOL,
HAVING YOUR MOM HOME, HUH?
SHE SEEMS REALLY COOL.

21:47.510 --> 21:49.550
WHATEVER.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.890
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME SOME
GARRISON STEELE PITCHES?

21:51.930 --> 21:53.600
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO
HEAR THEM?

21:53.640 --> 21:57.520
ANYTHING TO GET YOU TO
STOP TALKING ABOUT MY MOM.
GO ON.

21:57.560 --> 22:00.360
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
YOU READY?

22:00.400 --> 22:03.860
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-UH, OH! OH, THAT'S JAKE,

22:03.900 --> 22:06.410
I SHOULD PROBABLY...
YO, JAKE, WHAT'S UP? HEY

22:06.450 --> 22:08.070
IS, UH, GARRISON THERE,
BECAUSE

22:08.120 --> 22:10.450
I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO HIM
REGARDING A SENSITIVE
CREATIVE MATTER.

22:10.490 --> 22:13.580
DES, I NEED YOU TO TRACK
MY CREDIT CARDS, RIGHT AWAY.

22:13.620 --> 22:15.250
YEAH, YEAH, NO SWEAT, HOMMIE.
HANG ON, JUST LET ME SEE

22:15.290 --> 22:16.710
IF THERE'S ANY REAL-TIME
CHARGES.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.380
JUST DOING SOME
WORK FOR JAKE.

22:18.420 --> 22:21.420
UH... HANG ON.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.090
OH. HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING AT
EIGHT DIFFERENT BARS

22:26.130 --> 22:28.550
ON GEORGE STREET
IN THE LAST HOUR?

22:28.590 --> 22:31.810
NO, BUT I THINK I KNOW
WHO HAS. UH...

22:31.850 --> 22:35.310
OH WAIT. HEY! WHILE I
STILL HAVE YOU, WHICH TITLE DO
YOU LIKE MORE:

22:35.350 --> 22:39.650
MURDER, MURDER ON THE WALL,
OR--
HELLO? HELLO? JAKE?

22:39.690 --> 22:44.400
LISTEN, I HAVE TO GO FIND
STEELE BEFORE HE FRIGGIN'
BANKRUPTS ME.

22:45.900 --> 22:49.160
BUT I GOTTA STOP
AT THE HOSPITAL FOR A...

22:49.200 --> 22:51.410
SOMETHING, REAL QUICK.

22:51.450 --> 22:57.580
-&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;
-NIKKI AGAIN, HUH?
OH, JAKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:57.620 --> 23:01.630
DON'T GET ME STARTED.
I THINK HE'S SEEING HER AGAIN.

23:01.670 --> 23:03.250
I OUGHTA WHACK THE
CRAP OUT OF HIM.

23:03.300 --> 23:06.050
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU MIGHT
WANT TO TRY SOMETHING A
LITTLE DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW?

23:06.090 --> 23:08.340
A DIFFERENT TACTIC, MAYBE?
TALK IT THROUGH MAYBE?

23:08.380 --> 23:10.680
YEAH. MAYBE.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.180
-&lt;WHACK&gt;
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH NIKKI?

23:12.220 --> 23:14.470
ARE YOU PLANNING TO MAKE
HER ENTIRE LIFE A LIVING HELL?

23:14.510 --> 23:16.480
-&lt;WHACK&gt;
-OW! WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING?

23:16.520 --> 23:17.890
&lt;WHACK&gt;

23:17.930 --> 23:20.480
ROSE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO DISCUSS YOUR SITUATION

23:20.520 --> 23:22.440
WITH NIKKI,
SO HERE I AM TO DISCUSS IT.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.650
-&lt;WHACK&gt;
-OKAY, STOP HITTING ME.

23:23.690 --> 23:24.770
NO, I WON'T.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.280
OKAY, LOOK,
IT'S NOT MY FAULT YOU'RE

23:26.320 --> 23:29.240
IN A BAD MOOD BECAUSE YOU'RE
SUCH A TERRIBLE FATHER.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.700
LOOK, DON'T PUSH ME TODAY.

23:30.740 --> 23:35.160
I MEAN IT. THIS ISN'T ABOUT
ANY OF THAT.
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND NIKKI.

23:35.200 --> 23:38.620
I PARKED THE CAR RIGHT HERE.

23:38.660 --> 23:43.500
UGH! WHY IS STEELE ALWAYS
TAKING MY FRIGGIN' CAR?

23:43.540 --> 23:45.460
BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT
BOTHERS YOU.

23:45.500 --> 23:51.590
ALL RIGHT LOOK, I NEED YOU
TO... TAKE ME TO THE HOSPITAL
TO GO SEE NIKKI.

23:53.090 --> 23:54.600
&lt;SIGH&gt;

23:55.600 --> 23:57.140
SATURDAY YOU WANNA HANG OUT?

23:57.180 --> 24:00.440
I'M BUSY.
WORK STUFF FOR UNCLE JAKE.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.730
DON'T BE A SNOT. I JUST
GOT HOME. IT'D BE NICE TO
HANG OUT, THAT'S ALL.

24:03.770 --> 24:05.570
HEY.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.650
LOOK AT THAT.
HE MANAGED TO FIND HIS PANTS.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.530
BANG UP JOB, COCKY.

24:10.570 --> 24:12.860
-TINNY.
-I'LL SEE YOU CATS LATER.

24:18.330 --> 24:19.580
WHAT?

24:21.410 --> 24:22.960
&lt;DOOR SHUTTING&gt;

24:24.920 --> 24:30.590
I SEEM TO HAVE THIS CONSTANT,
CHRONIC PAIN IN MY...
GUILT AREA.

24:30.630 --> 24:34.550
YEAH, I KNOW THE FEELING.
IT WAS A BAD IDEA,
WHAT WE DID.

24:35.510 --> 24:37.260
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.640
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SO
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.180
NO, NO, NIKKI, COME ON.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.560
&lt;FRUSTRATED GROAN&gt;

24:42.600 --> 24:44.900
COME ON. SERIOUSLY.
THINK ABOUT IT.
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

24:44.940 --> 24:47.190
WE'VE DONE IT OVER AND
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
IT WAS A--

24:47.230 --> 24:49.690
HORRIBLE IDEA.
WE'RE WRONG FOR EACH OTHER.

24:49.730 --> 24:52.700
EXACTLY. AND US SLEEPING
TOGETHER, IT WAS...

24:53.530 --> 24:55.570
IT WAS MEANINGLESS.

24:56.830 --> 24:58.200
YES.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.160
IT WAS NOTHING AT ALL.

25:01.660 --> 25:03.870
IT WAS... NOTHING.

25:15.590 --> 25:16.640
I LOVE YOU.

25:16.680 --> 25:17.930
I LOVE YOU TOO.

25:17.970 --> 25:19.600
&lt;MUFFLED THROUGH KISSING&gt;

25:19.640 --> 25:22.100
STOP DOING THAT!
YOU HAVE TO STOP KISSING ME.

25:22.140 --> 25:23.440
YOU KISSED ME, OKAY?

25:23.480 --> 25:25.440
-I DON'T LOVE YOU LIKE THAT.
-I DON'T LOVE YOU EITHER.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.650
I'M MARRIED.
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

25:28.690 --> 25:30.730
NOTHING. WE'RE DOING NOTHING.

25:30.780 --> 25:33.860
HEY. HEY, NIKKI.
SORRY, I GOTTA TAKE JAKE NOW.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.860
GOOD.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.120
JACOB...

25:46.370 --> 25:47.960
I KNOW THAT SOMEWHERE DEEP

25:48.000 --> 25:49.710
BENEATH THAT THICK SKULL OF

25:49.750 --> 25:53.210
YOURS IS A GOOD LOAD OF COMMON
SENSE. USE IT. NIKKI'S HAPPY.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.380
MOVE ON.

25:55.430 --> 25:58.640
IT'D BE DIFFERENT IF SHE WAS
THE ONE, BUT WE BOTH KNOW

25:58.680 --> 26:02.560
SHE'S NOT,
SO DO THE RIGHT THING.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.820
NOW THAT THAT'S OUT OF
YOUR SYSTEM,
SHALL WE HIT GEORGE STREET

26:10.860 --> 26:12.690
AND TRACK DOWN GARRISON
AND YOUR CREDIT CARD?

26:12.730 --> 26:15.610
LOOK IT DOESN'T MATTER.
MY CREDIT CARD IS GONNA BE
WAY OVER THE LIMIT ANYWAY,

26:15.650 --> 26:17.610
THE WAY THAT
GARRISON STEELE DRINKS.

26:18.780 --> 26:20.660
I WANT GARRISON STEELE.

26:21.910 --> 26:23.750
-WHO'S THIS?
-IT'S A LONG STORY.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.460
-OKAY, OKAY, JUST STOP.
-I'M STOPPED.

26:26.500 --> 26:30.250
WE'RE STOPPED.
STAND DOWN, BABE.

26:30.290 --> 26:33.880
YOU WANNA TALK BUSINESS,
I'M A BUSINESSMAN, OKAY?

26:33.920 --> 26:36.630
I'M A PUBLISHER OF GENTLEMEN'S
MAGAZINES AND VIDEOS.

26:36.670 --> 26:38.800
WE'RE EXPANDING INTO THE
EROTIC NOVEL GAME AND

26:38.840 --> 26:40.850
STEELE WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE US
A BIG PUSH.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.640
I PAID HIM A HEFTY ADVANCE,
AND HE STIFFED US.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.720
OH, THERE'S A HUGE SURPRISE.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.770
I WANT THE NOVEL. HE OWES ME.

26:46.810 --> 26:48.560
-WE'LL LET STEELE KNOW.
-YOU'LL LET HIM KNOW?

26:48.600 --> 26:53.900
LISTEN TO ME. IF I HAVE TO
KEEP CHASING HIM AROUND AGAIN,
I'LL LET HIM KNOW, YOU KNOW?

26:55.860 --> 26:59.820
WE'RE NOT JOKING AROUND.
COME ON.

26:59.860 --> 27:02.660
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

27:05.120 --> 27:06.290
YEAH?

27:06.330 --> 27:08.790
UH, I STOLE YOUR CAR,

27:08.830 --> 27:10.920
BUT I AM DEFINITELY

27:10.960 --> 27:12.750
OVER THE DRIVING LIMIT,

27:12.790 --> 27:14.500
BOOZE-WISE. SO,

27:14.550 --> 27:17.300
I-- I-- I'M AT TAMARA'S PLACE.

27:17.340 --> 27:19.840
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.850
-STEELE.
-HELLO, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU BOTH.

27:25.890 --> 27:30.600
NO WORRIES.
I WAS COMPLETELY SOBER AND
LEGAL BEHIND THE WHEEL.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.650
YOU STOLE MY CAR AGAIN.

27:32.690 --> 27:35.690
BORROWED. I'M SURE
MALACHY TAUGHT YOU THE
IMPORTANCE OF SHARING.

27:35.730 --> 27:38.400
NOPE. HE NEVER TOOK TO IT.

27:38.450 --> 27:40.610
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE EVEN
DOING HERE ANYWAYS?

27:40.660 --> 27:46.700
MMM. TAMARA PROMISED
TO HELP US IF WE HELPED HER.

27:46.740 --> 27:49.960
-PLEASE GET ME AWAY FROM HERE.
-LOOK, LADY, WE'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE WITH

27:50.000 --> 27:51.830
THAT THING ON YOUR ANKLE.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.500
UH...

27:54.960 --> 27:56.880
OH, HE'S GOT A GUN.
WE GOTTA CHANGE OF PLANS.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.970
GET IN THE CAR.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.800
-[JAKE] STAY STILL.
-[MAL] HURRY UP.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.260
THIS WON'T HURT, I PROMISE.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.470
UGH, GET IN THE CAR. COME ON!

28:05.510 --> 28:09.270
[GARRISON]
I'M NOT READY TO DIE YET.
OKAY, GO!

28:09.310 --> 28:11.390
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

28:12.060 --> 28:13.440
STEELE!

28:13.480 --> 28:15.400
&lt;ANGRY GRUNTS&gt;

28:16.320 --> 28:19.530
I NEED A SYNONYM FOR "BUXOM".

28:19.570 --> 28:20.860
UH...

28:20.900 --> 28:22.110
BOSOMY, CHESTY,

28:22.160 --> 28:23.820
WELL-ENDOWED, CURVY,

28:23.870 --> 28:25.780
VOLUPTUOUS, STACKED, AMPLE.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.410
I'M DES, I'M PLEASED TO MAKE
YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

28:27.450 --> 28:28.580
CHARMED.

28:28.620 --> 28:30.120
GET OUT. NOW!

28:30.160 --> 28:31.410
YEAH.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.870
SO, JAVIER.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.670
"JAVIAR".

28:34.710 --> 28:37.050
WHATEVER. HE'S MAD AT YOU
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
DELIVERED HIS BOOK.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.880
AND GERHARDT HERE WANTS

28:38.920 --> 28:40.760
YOU DEAD FOR SOME
OTHER REASON.

28:40.800 --> 28:41.930
IT'S FUNNY, STEELE,

28:41.970 --> 28:43.800
EVERYWHERE YOU GO SOMEONE
WANTS TO KILL YOU.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.050
-I DON'T WANT TO KILL HIM.
-YET.

28:46.100 --> 28:50.310
I AM IN DEBT. BAD.

28:50.350 --> 28:52.600
I GOT THE ADVANCE FOR

28:52.640 --> 28:54.810
MY NEXT NOVEL FROM MY REGULAR

28:54.850 --> 28:56.860
PUBLISHER, AND ANOTHER FROM

28:56.900 --> 28:57.940
JAVIER. AND THEN I DO WHAT I

28:57.980 --> 28:59.440
NORMALLY DO. I-- I-- I FLEW

28:59.480 --> 29:01.280
SOMEWHERE EXOTIC TO FIND MY

29:01.320 --> 29:04.860
MUSE.
THIS TIME IT WAS DENMARK.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.780
NICE. VERY VIKINGY.

29:06.820 --> 29:07.950
GET OUT.

29:07.990 --> 29:09.830
YES.

29:09.870 --> 29:11.580
HOW'D DENMARK GO FOR YOU,
GARRISON?

29:11.620 --> 29:14.330
EVERYTHING WENT WRONG. UH, I

29:14.370 --> 29:18.630
LOST BIG TIME, BACCARAT,
AND SO I HAD TO BORROW
MONEY FROM GERHARDT.

29:18.670 --> 29:20.300
HOW MUCH?

29:20.340 --> 29:22.840
IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.800
AND WHEN DOES YOUR
LOAN COME DUE?

29:24.840 --> 29:27.010
IT-- IT ALREADY DID.

29:27.050 --> 29:29.310
SO I HAD TO BREAK
INTO GERHARDT'S OFFICE
IN DENMARK.

29:29.350 --> 29:32.390
MY PLAN WAS TO
STEAL CASH FROM HIS

29:32.430 --> 29:35.650
SAFE IN ORDER TO PAY OFF
MY DEBT.

29:35.690 --> 29:38.650
-THAT'S AN AWFUL PLAN.
-I COMPLETELY AGREE.

29:38.690 --> 29:40.940
I'M GONE, I'M GONE.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.740
WHEN I BROKE INTO GERHARDT'S
OFFICE, ALL I COULD FIND

29:42.780 --> 29:44.740
WAS THE FILE ON TAMARA, SO

29:44.780 --> 29:47.660
I THOUGHT IF I COULD FIND WHAT

29:47.700 --> 29:50.910
TAMARA STOLE -
WITH YOUR HELP -

29:50.950 --> 29:55.290
I-- I-- I MIGHT BE
ABLE TO TRADE
IT BACK TO GERHARDT IN

29:55.330 --> 29:57.500
EXCHANGE FOR FORGIVENESS
OF MY DEBT.

29:57.540 --> 29:59.710
YOU WERE GOING TO SELL ME OUT.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.590
THAT WAS BEFORE I MET YOU.

30:01.630 --> 30:04.010
AND, UH, WHY IS GERHARDT
AFTER YOU, TAMARA?

30:04.050 --> 30:07.640
IF I TELL YOU, I WANT YOUR
HELP TO GET OUT OF
THE COUNTRY.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.720
FINE.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.760
PART OF MY JOB AT THE
CONSULATE IS PACKING AND

30:10.810 --> 30:12.470
UNPACKING DIPLOMATIC POUCHES.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.850
GERHARDT'S MY EX-BOSS.

30:14.890 --> 30:16.980

30:17.020 --> 30:18.690
CULTURAL ATTACHE TO THE
CONSULATE,

30:18.730 --> 30:20.190

GERHARDT WANT YOU TO STEAL?

30:30.070 --> 30:31.990

30:32.040 --> 30:34.910
-WHY DOES HE WANT FISH EGGS?
-OTHER THAN ITS REFINED TASTE?

30:34.950 --> 30:36.540
I DON'T KNOW.

30:36.580 --> 30:37.710

30:37.750 --> 30:39.210
I HID IT. I KNEW THERE

32:34.740 --> 32:37.790

I WANT MY BOOK OR MY MONEY.
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

32:57.310 --> 32:59.060
OKAY, THAT'S A START.

32:59.100 --> 33:02.230
STEELE WHY DID YOU MOOCH OUT

WORDS EXACTLY!

33:21.540 --> 33:23.620

HASN'T GIVEN THIS ONE UP, AND
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN HE'S GIVEN

33:37.350 --> 33:41.060
-HIM PLENTY OF REASON.
-I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

33:41.100 --> 33:45.230
YOU TAKE ME FOR THE KIND OF
GUY THAT MAKES A PROMISE AND
DOESN'T KEEP IT?

33:46.190 --> 33:47.360
NO.

33:48.310 --> 33:49.320
GOOD.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.650
STEELE, HOW LONG DOES IT
TAKE YOU TO WRITE A BOOK?

33:52.690 --> 33:54.700
YOU-- YOU CAN'T ASK
AN ARTIST SUCH A QUESTION.

33:54.740 --> 33:58.160
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO
COUNT THE STARS?
WHAT COLOR IS LOVE?

33:58.200 --> 34:00.030
-ART IS--
-SHUT UP.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.040
LET'S SAY 20 DAYS.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.580
WILL THAT WORK?

34:04.620 --> 34:06.290
JUST MAKE SURE THERE'S

34:06.330 --> 34:10.800
LOTS OF BOOBIES, OR I'LL COME

34:10.840 --> 34:13.260
20 DAYS? I-- I--

34:13.300 --> 34:17.300
I'M GOING TO NEED
A NEW ASSISTANT.
THEY ACTUALLY DO ALL THE WORK.

34:17.340 --> 34:18.640
SHALL WE?

34:20.720 --> 34:22.600
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
WHY ARE YOU ACTING SO NERVOUS?

34:22.640 --> 34:24.560
I'M NOT NERVOUS.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.270
THERE.
THAT'S MY SIDE OF THE DEAL.

34:26.310 --> 34:27.940
NOW GET ME OUT OF THE COUNTY.

34:27.980 --> 34:30.980
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
GIVE ME A SEC. I'LL SEE
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

34:34.400 --> 34:37.240
CAVIAR? I DON'T GET IT.

34:37.280 --> 34:41.990
[GERHARDT] OKAY, EVERYONE TURN
AROUND, SLOWLY PLEASE. SLOWLY.

34:42.030 --> 34:44.580
I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MOOD TO
SHOOT ANYONE TODAY REALLY.

34:44.620 --> 34:46.540
HOW DID YOU FIND US?

34:46.580 --> 34:48.880
OH, A LITTLE WRITER FRIEND OF
MINE GAVE ME A QUICK
HEAD'S UP

34:48.920 --> 34:50.710
IN EXCHANGE FOR A DEBT.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.800
NOW, STEELE, EVEN THOUGH
OUR DEBT IS SETTLED,

34:52.840 --> 34:55.880
YOU'RE STILL OBLIGATED TO
READ MY BOOK. SORRY.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.130
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TRUSTED YOU.

34:58.180 --> 35:00.340
THE PROSE IS AWKWARD.

35:00.390 --> 35:03.140
I ADMIT TO THAT.
IT NEEDS WORK.

35:03.180 --> 35:06.390
BUT THE PLOT STRUCTURE ITSELF
I THINK IS ACTUALLY
QUITE GOOD.

35:06.430 --> 35:09.730
I, UH, I DREW ON WEALTH OF
EXPERIENCE FROM MY TIME AT THE
EMBASSY--

35:09.770 --> 35:11.810
DO WE REALLY HAVE TO
LISTEN TO THIS?

35:14.320 --> 35:16.940
I'LL GO OVER THE
CHARACTER ARCS WITH YOU
LATER, ALL RIGHT?

35:16.990 --> 35:19.950
BRING THE CAVIAR TIN
OVER HERE NOW. COME ON.

35:19.990 --> 35:23.530
AND NO ONE DO ANYTHING STUPID.
I'M NOT AFRAID TO SHOOT ANY
ONE OF YOU,

35:23.580 --> 35:25.120
I GUARANTEE YOU THAT.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.290
I'M TRULY SORRY.

35:26.330 --> 35:29.040
TAMARA, YOU AND I
NEED TO HAVE A LONG CHAT.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.750
IS IT ABOUT YOUR STUPID BOOK?

35:30.790 --> 35:33.340
IT'S ABOUT YOUR LIFE
EXPECTANCY.

35:34.460 --> 35:36.840
THAT'S A GOOD LINE,
HUH? WRITE THAT DOWN.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.300
-PLEASE, HELP ME!
-COME ON.

35:42.970 --> 35:44.930
&lt;WHACK&gt;

35:44.970 --> 35:49.980
I HAVE EXPENSIVE DENTAL WORK.
DON'T BE SUCH A BARBARIAN.

35:51.020 --> 35:52.940
YOU TRADED A GIRL FOR
YOUR DEBT!

35:52.980 --> 35:55.150
I'M NOT HEARTLESS.
I THOUGHT GERHARDT ONLY
WANTED THE TIN.

35:55.190 --> 35:58.280
WELL, NOW HE HAS TAMARA
AND THE TIN!

35:58.320 --> 36:01.530
THE BRIGHT SIDE IS HE
MIGHT LEAVE ME ALONE NOW
ABOUT HIS BOOK.

36:02.410 --> 36:03.700
GIVE ME THAT.

36:03.740 --> 36:08.620
THAT IS VERY EXPENSIVE
SCOTCH... WHICH BY THE WAY,

36:08.660 --> 36:11.620
YOU, YOU PAID FOR ON
YOUR CREDIT CARD.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.420
STEELE, YOU HAVE CROSSED
THE LINE THIS TIME.

36:14.460 --> 36:18.130
IT'S ONE THING TO DRAG
YOURSELF DOWN INTO THE--
THE CRAP.

36:18.170 --> 36:20.720
BUT YOU MIGHT GET THIS GIRL
KILLED.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.640
LOOK AT YOURSELF.

36:22.680 --> 36:26.260
YOU'RE A MESS!

36:26.310 --> 36:32.190
I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT YOU'RE
A HEAVY WEIGHT. IT'S TIME
YOU STARTED ACTING LIKE ONE.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.780
[JAKE] ANY WORD ON THAT CAN OF
FISH EGGS?

36:37.820 --> 36:38.900
OH, WELL I THOUGHT IT HAVE

36:38.940 --> 36:40.150
COME FROM, LIKE, A GIANT SQUID

36:40.190 --> 36:41.530
OR SOMETHING.
BUT IT TURNS OUT,

36:41.570 --> 36:44.780
IT'S JUST NORMAL CAVIAR.
RETAIL PRICE, LIKE, 200 BUCKS.

36:44.820 --> 36:46.240
SO WHY THE HELL DOES EVERYBODY
WANT IT SO BAD?

36:46.280 --> 36:49.200
-IT DID COME IN A NICE BAG.
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

36:49.250 --> 36:50.410
HELLO?

36:50.450 --> 36:53.710
VERY, VERY NICE WITH
THE OLD BAIT AND SWITCH.

36:53.750 --> 36:57.710
-WHERE'S MY ITEM?
-YOUR ITEM?

36:57.750 --> 36:59.550
LOOK, DON'T MESS WITH ME.
I AM TIRED OF THAT.

36:59.590 --> 37:00.800
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

37:00.840 --> 37:01.880
OKAY, OKAY. WAIT. WAIT.

37:01.920 --> 37:05.470
YOU'LL GET YOUR, UH,
YOUR "ITEM", ALL RIGHT?

37:05.510 --> 37:08.470
BUT YOU GOTTA GIVE US
TAMARA FIRST.

37:10.220 --> 37:11.930
SAME PLACE AS BEFORE.
ONE HOUR.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.400
AND DON'T BE CLEVER THIS TIME.

37:15.810 --> 37:16.860
WHAT DID HE WANT?

37:16.900 --> 37:19.280
I DON'T KNOW. HIS "ITEM".

37:19.320 --> 37:21.570
BUT WE GAVE HIM THE
CAVIAR IN A LOVELY BAG.

37:21.610 --> 37:23.360
WHAT MORE COULD HE WANT?

37:23.400 --> 37:25.450
-ROSE?
-HMM?

37:25.490 --> 37:28.410
DID YOU DO THAT SEARCH OF
RECENT THEFT AND
CRIME ACTIVITY

37:28.450 --> 37:29.870
IN DENMARK?

37:29.910 --> 37:31.250
YES, I DID, AND THAT

37:31.290 --> 37:32.540
DIDN'T REALLY TURN UP MUCH.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.500
THERE WAS A BANK ROBBERY,
MUSEUM

37:34.540 --> 37:37.040
THEFT AND A BIG
ELECTRONIC EXPO WAS HIT,

37:37.080 --> 37:38.840
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.880
MUSEUM THEFT.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.800
-ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?
-YEAH.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.630
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
DES' SPECIAL SKILLS.

37:45.680 --> 37:50.470
-WHICH ONES, B'Y?
-&lt;CRASH&gt;

37:50.510 --> 37:52.600
[TAMARA] GARRISON STEELE IS
NOT GOING TO SHOW UP.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.390
WHY WOULD HE SHOW UP?

37:54.440 --> 37:57.610
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
BECAUSE YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY
FETCHING AND I FEEL SLIGHTLY

37:57.650 --> 38:00.320
RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING YOU IN
THAT POSITION.

38:00.360 --> 38:01.440
SLIGHTLY RESPONSIBLE?

38:01.480 --> 38:03.190
YOU'RE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE!

38:03.240 --> 38:06.410
-NOBODY ASKED YOU.
-GARRISON. FIRST OF ALL,

38:06.450 --> 38:08.240
I'VE GOT MY SHORT STORY FOR
YOU TO READ.

38:08.280 --> 38:12.450
NOW IT'S A FIRST DRAFT,
BUT I WANT YOU TO BE HONEST.
KIND, BUT HONEST.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.910
GOOD GOD. SHORT?

38:13.950 --> 38:16.120
AND SECONDLY,
DID YOU BRING MY ITEM?

38:16.170 --> 38:19.590
I'M GONNA BE HONEST. AT FIRST,
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT IN THE
HELL YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.

38:19.630 --> 38:23.090
I MEAN, ITEM?
AND THEN IT DAWNED ON ME.

38:23.130 --> 38:26.800
REALLY QUITE BRILLIANT
FOR YOU DO BE USING THE CAVIAR

38:26.840 --> 38:32.100
TO HIDE WHAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY
SMUGGLING.

38:32.140 --> 38:34.310
COME ON, ENOUGH CHIT-CHAT.
JUST GIVE ME THE SKETCH.

38:34.350 --> 38:35.390
A MAGNUSSEN SKETCH.

38:35.430 --> 38:37.850
THAT WAS STOLEN THREE
MONTHS AGO. IT'S PRICELESS.

38:38.730 --> 38:39.940
&lt;CLICK&gt;

38:39.980 --> 38:41.320
HEY, HEY, HEY!
DON'T DO ANYTHING RASH THERE.

38:41.360 --> 38:44.150
OKAY NOW, YOU CAN SHOOT ME,
I DROP THIS, THE PAINTING

38:44.190 --> 38:49.450
GOES UP IN FLAMES, OR YOU GIVE
STEELE THE KEYS TO THE
HANDCUFFS AND YOU LET HER GO.

38:52.410 --> 38:54.040
FINE.

38:57.580 --> 39:00.580
PLEASE KNOW THIS WAS ALWAYS
MY PLAN. HOW COULD I ABANDON

39:00.630 --> 39:03.590
A CREATURE AS
BEAUTIFUL AS YOU?

39:03.630 --> 39:05.590
COME ON. YOU GOT THE GIRL.
GIVE ME THE SKETCH.

39:05.630 --> 39:07.380
YEAH...

39:07.420 --> 39:09.510
OH! YOU IDIOT!

39:09.550 --> 39:10.590
GERHARDT?

39:10.640 --> 39:11.720
&lt;WHACK&gt;

39:11.760 --> 39:13.760
-THAT'S FOR EARLIER.
-&lt;CLANG&gt;

39:15.430 --> 39:16.560
NICE WORK.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.520
NOW THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.
TOO BAD YOU HAD TO BURN A

39:19.560 --> 39:22.360
BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ART TO
SAVE A MASTERPIECE.

39:26.110 --> 39:31.410
I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YOU.
I'M A BIGGER FAN OF AN
ORIGINAL MYSELF.

39:31.450 --> 39:33.240
WHAT A REVEAL.

39:33.280 --> 39:36.160
IT'S PERFECT.

39:36.200 --> 39:41.330
SO I TOOK A PHOTO OF THE
SKETCH, THEN I MADE A STENCIL,
AND THEN I USED SPRAY PAINT TO

39:41.380 --> 39:42.840
MAKE THE FORGERY.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.130
-I DON'T CARE.
-REALLY?

39:44.170 --> 39:46.340
WELL, IT KIND OF MAKES ME THE
BANKSY OF NEWFOUNDLAND.

39:46.380 --> 39:48.340
MORE LIKE THE BELL-HEAD
OF OUTER COVE.

39:48.380 --> 39:49.470
NICE.

39:49.510 --> 39:51.640
-BUT IT IS A GOOD JOB THOUGH.
-THANKS.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.850
-SO, GO AWAY NOW.
-WHY?

39:52.890 --> 39:54.640
-GO.
-OH.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.600
THE LOVE CANAL?

39:59.640 --> 40:01.150
I'M SENSING A HIT.

40:01.190 --> 40:05.150
YEAH, IT'S WRITTEN BY
FORD PLATINUM, THAT'S GARRISON
STEELE'S PSEUDONYM WHEN HE

40:05.190 --> 40:09.700
WRITES... ADULT NOVELS. I CAN
GET YOU AN AUTOGRAPHED COPY
IF YOU WANT.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.820
I'LL PASS. THANKS.

40:12.870 --> 40:14.700
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT

40:14.740 --> 40:16.950
AN INTERNATIONAL SMUGGLER,

40:16.990 --> 40:18.540
OR A PRICELESS SKETCH
SHOWING UP AT

40:18.580 --> 40:19.660
THE STATION TODAY?

40:19.710 --> 40:22.880
NO. I MEAN, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A CHEESY PLOT FROM
THIS NOVEL.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.790
WELL, IT'S-- IT'S REAL.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.460
AND FOR THE RECORD,
IT WAS HUGE.

40:26.500 --> 40:30.380
LIKE AN INTERNATIONAL SEARCH
KIND OF THING. SO...

40:30.420 --> 40:33.010
IS THAT YOUR WAY OF
TRYING TO PAY ME A COMPLIMENT?

40:33.050 --> 40:36.060
GOD, NO.

40:36.100 --> 40:42.100
LISTEN, ABOUT THE GUY YOU
WERE WITH AT THE DANISH
CONSULATE PARTY. YOUR DATE.

40:42.140 --> 40:48.320
THINGS GOING WELL?
IS THERE SOMETHING REAL THERE
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

40:50.530 --> 40:54.490
MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW.

40:55.910 --> 40:58.990
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

40:59.660 --> 41:01.870
I'M SORRY.

41:02.540 --> 41:05.330
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, DOYLE.

41:08.550 --> 41:12.300
-NIKKI, I--
-YOU KNOW, THE LAST TIME
WE SAID WE LOVED EACH OTHER,

41:12.340 --> 41:13.880
WE ENDED UP MARRIED.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.350
YEAH, AND WE BOTH KNOW
HOW THAT TURNED OUT.

41:16.390 --> 41:19.560
IT'S LIKE WE GO TO THIS
PLACE WHERE IT'S THE SEX
AND NOT THE LOVE TALKING.

41:19.600 --> 41:24.270
LIKE, I KNOW I LOVE YOU BUT,
I DON'T "LOVE" LOVE YOU,
OBVIOUSLY.

41:24.310 --> 41:26.650
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE, SO
MAYBE WE SHOULD BOTH JUST PUT

41:26.690 --> 41:29.480
THIS WHOLE THING BEHIND US,
YEAH?

41:29.530 --> 41:30.570
BUT, UH, ABOUT DAVID.

41:30.610 --> 41:33.450
NIKKI, I KNOW YOU FEEL
GUILTY, BUT THERE'S NO POINT

41:33.490 --> 41:35.610
IN TELLING DAVID ANYTHING.

41:36.950 --> 41:38.370
NEVER MIND.

41:38.410 --> 41:39.740
NOTHING.

41:39.790 --> 41:42.040
TALK TO YA, 'KAY?

41:59.640 --> 42:00.720
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

42:00.760 --> 42:03.100
YOU LOOK... GREAT.

42:03.140 --> 42:06.520
WELL, A MAN MUST LOOK THE PART
WHEN HE'S A "HEAVY WEIGHT".

42:06.560 --> 42:08.060
GARRISON, COME ON.
WE'RE GOING TO MISS
OUR FLIGHT.

42:10.020 --> 42:11.730
TURNS OUT SHE IS THE

42:11.780 --> 42:13.820
LOVE OF MY LIFE.

42:13.860 --> 42:15.240
WE'RE HEADING TO DENMARK
TO TESTIFY AGAINST

42:15.280 --> 42:16.570
GERHARDT, AND THE COURT HAS

42:16.610 --> 42:19.530
DROPPED THE CHARGES AGAINST
TAMARA IN EXCHANGE FOR

42:19.580 --> 42:21.660
RECOVERING THE SKETCH.

42:21.700 --> 42:23.830
AND THEN WE'RE OFF TO VEGAS.

42:26.580 --> 42:28.210
I'LL BE IN THE LOO.

42:28.250 --> 42:29.790
SEE YOU SHORTLY, MY DARLING.

42:29.840 --> 42:32.130
LIKE THEY SAY, THE FIFTH
TIME'S THE CHARM, WHAT?

42:32.170 --> 42:37.300
AND LISTEN, I'M NOT FORGETTING
YOU OWE ME A PIECE OF
THIS BOOK AND NOT THE

42:37.340 --> 42:39.390
-GARBAGE YOU'RE WRITING
FOR JAVIER.
-"JAVIAR".

42:39.430 --> 42:41.510
-WHATEVER.
-NO WORRIES.

42:41.560 --> 42:44.810
TAMARA'S MY NEW ASSISTANT,
AND THANKS TO THIS LATEST
ADVENTURE I HAVE THE

42:44.850 --> 42:46.060
IDEA FOR MY NEXT NOVEL.

42:46.100 --> 42:48.730
LET ME GUESS, ANOTHER SPECIAL DETECTIVE  ?

42:48.770 --> 42:51.770
NO, I HAVE DISCOVERED A
MUCH GREATER PROTAGONIST.

42:51.820 --> 42:54.190
WHO? DES?

42:54.230 --> 42:55.530
ME.

42:55.570 --> 42:57.820
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST BOOK
IN MY NEW SERIES

42:57.860 --> 43:01.200
STEELING THE NIGHT AWAY:
THE GARRISON STEELE
MYSTERIES.

43:01.240 --> 43:02.950
MY REP HAS ALREADY
SOLD THE TV RIGHTS.

43:02.990 --> 43:05.660
-&lt;CLINK&gt;
-TO YOU.

43:06.370 --> 43:07.710
MMM.

43:07.750 --> 43:09.000
WELL, JAKE DOYLE,

43:09.040 --> 43:10.920
UNTIL NEXT TIME. CIAO, BELLO.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.420
CIAO, MAN.

43:12.460 --> 43:13.800
CAN I GIVE YOU ONE
LAST PIECE OF ADVICE?

43:13.840 --> 43:15.550
-NO.
-DUCK.

43:15.590 --> 43:17.550
-&lt;WHACK&gt;
-OW!

43:18.180 --> 43:20.220
