WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:04.938
Yee! Father, I'm so glad
we're doing this together.

00:05.072 --> 00:06.073
Me too.

00:06.106 --> 00:08.308
-I've even got my Cyrus shirt on.
-Really?

00:08.375 --> 00:11.545
-You got on your "Party in the USA" hat.
-My "Party in the USA" hat.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.514
-I got my Cyrus nails.
-You sure do.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.983
I'm Cyrused out. You know what
we should break into?

00:16.082 --> 00:17.718
-What's that?
-"Little Red Caboose".

00:17.784 --> 00:19.887
Oh, no way.
Should we warm up with it?

00:19.953 --> 00:23.657
We should warm up with it.
One, two, three, four...

00:42.543 --> 00:44.278
I'll tell you what, now.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.880
-What are you gonna tell me?
-I don't know.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.650
I think today's gonna be fun.
It could break into a fist fight.

00:49.716 --> 00:53.520
-I put my money on a fist fight.
-You know what we call a fist fight?

00:53.587 --> 00:56.423
-Cyrus Family Reunion.
-You got that right.

01:15.108 --> 01:16.710
Do you recognise this hat?

01:16.777 --> 01:20.180
-I do recognise that hat.
-You know who I stole it from?

01:20.247 --> 01:22.816
-I believe you stole that from me.
-I believe so.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.219
That thing comes all the way back
from '92, buddy.

01:25.285 --> 01:26.954
The 25-year anniversary.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.389
-Twenty-five years. Can you believe it?
-Of this hat.

01:29.456 --> 01:32.826
The "Achy Breaky" of my life.
You know I'm gonna be 25 this year?

01:32.893 --> 01:34.595
-No way.
-Yeah.

01:34.661 --> 01:37.798
Well, actually, I did know that.

01:37.865 --> 01:42.469
That's how I keep a record of everything,
is based on when you were born.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.472
That's the most significant moment
of my life,

01:45.539 --> 01:48.609
the moment you came out of mother's...

01:48.675 --> 01:50.110
Oh, God. Hoochie-coochie?

01:50.177 --> 01:51.778
Hoochie-coochie.

01:53.747 --> 01:56.149
-And now here we are.
-Here we are.

02:01.054 --> 02:04.725
Oh, come on, I love this.
I can't stop listening to it.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.127
I love this.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.131
I love this.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.073
Yeah.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.084
Yeah!

02:50.537 --> 02:53.106
-I love that.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.775
The Cyrus clap.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.860
-You like that tune?
-I love it.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.661
-I just love that song.
-Thank you.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.063
I love it a lot, I love it.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.332
-You ready to pick up Mama and Brandi?
-Sure.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.969
-There they are. Hi, Mammie.
-There she is.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.370
Hi, Mama.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.972
-Hi!
-Hi!

03:25.072 --> 03:26.473
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Mammie.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.675
-Don't you look great?
-Skinny?

03:29.276 --> 03:31.645
-Hi, honey.
-You look so pretty.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.181
Do you believe
how beautiful Mammie looks?

03:34.248 --> 03:38.318
-All right. This is awesome.
-Shall we get in the car?

03:38.385 --> 03:41.655
-Okay. I love you, Mom.
-Hey, I'm still driving, shotgun.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.857
-Oh. Love you, Mammie.
-I love you, too.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.561
I'm in the back with Mom?

03:50.197 --> 03:51.932
Father, are you capable of this?

03:51.999 --> 03:54.801
-Wanna sing one?
-Let's sing one.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.304
-What are we singing?
-This is your song, Mother.

03:57.371 --> 04:00.340
It's all of our songs, because it is
a freaking "Party in the USA".

04:00.407 --> 04:01.575
-Oh, my God.
-Get it, honey.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.049
-Yeah.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.062
I can't believe you have to look
at the lyrics.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.230
You can't look.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.139
Live your life.

04:49.489 --> 04:52.192
Do the high notes, Mama.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.069
-Get it.
-Yeah.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.407
Mom does not know the words.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.862
Hey.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.365
Come on!

05:43.410 --> 05:45.946
I don't think I'd gone through puberty
when I recorded this song.

05:56.657 --> 05:57.824
Whoo!

05:58.825 --> 06:01.595
OK, Mom and Brandi,
we're gonna play a game...

06:01.662 --> 06:04.798
-I love games.
-...that's called "Cyrus VS Cyrus".

06:04.865 --> 06:06.099
-What?
-Gosh.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.836
Basically what happens is,
you look at each other and say

06:08.902 --> 06:10.504
the first word that comes to mind.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.040
-What?
-You keep getting closer to the same word.

06:13.073 --> 06:17.110
So if I said "car" and Dad said "red",
then maybe you could be like...

06:17.945 --> 06:19.546
-Ass?
-Like... What?

06:19.613 --> 06:20.814
-Red ass?
-What?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.482
-OK.
-What did she...

06:22.549 --> 06:24.818
-I don't understand.
-A car and red.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.454
-Then you could be like "Corvette".
-I would have said "Corvette".

06:27.521 --> 06:30.090
-I wanna be on your team.
-OK, I'll see.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.192
Just try to end up
getting to the same word.

06:32.259 --> 06:33.794
OK. Ready, Brandi? You and me.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.896
-One, two, three: Ocean.
-Hat.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.064
-What did you say?
-Hat.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.565
-Malibu.
-You have a hat on.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.434
-You're not on my team.
-I said Malibu.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.669
-But you're not on my team.
-You are on my team.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.871
This is terrible.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.572
-One, two, three: Sun.
-Visor.

06:45.639 --> 06:49.142
We're getting closer. One, two, three.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.477
-Sand.
-Suntan lotion.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.513
OK. One, two, three.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.714
-Beach.
-Surfboard.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.083
Damn. OK. One, two, three.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.584
-Kayak.
-Paddleboard.

06:57.651 --> 07:01.488
Paddleboard and kayak is really close.
We stop. Mom, let's you and I try, ready?

07:01.555 --> 07:03.123
-It's not easy.
-One, two, three.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.124
-Shopping.
-Clothes.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.326
Close. We're on the same. Right? Ready?

07:06.393 --> 07:07.828
One, two, three.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.264
-Jewellery.
-I was literally gonna say jewellery.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.598
-You didn't.
-Do it again.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.700
-You didn't.
-I was literally gonna say jewellery.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.236
-You cannot hesitate.
-She's making stuff up.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.138
She wasn't gonna say jewellery.

07:18.205 --> 07:21.241
Oh, good. I got one.
One, two, three: Baby.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.610
-You got to be quicker.
-You're the worst.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.113
-You got to go like this. OK.
-Jeez.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.481
-One, two, three.
-Hair.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.217
Nashville. OK. One, two, three:

07:30.284 --> 07:31.285
-Dolly.
-Mullet.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.853
-Damn.
-That's what I would have said.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.155
That was close. One, two, three.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.590
-Dad.
-Tennessee.

07:36.657 --> 07:37.758
-Close.
-Mullet.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.860
I got one. One, two, three.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.061
-Boots.
-Boots.

07:41.094 --> 07:45.065
Yeah. We got it!

07:56.176 --> 07:58.779
-Should we go pick up Noah?
-Let's get her.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.347
Look at her.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.253
-Whoa!
-Roll it down!

08:06.320 --> 08:07.588
We are all starving.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.390
-What are you packing there?
-You're not driving.

08:10.457 --> 08:11.625
What?

08:11.692 --> 08:14.027
You are the slowest driver.
Put it in park.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.263
-It's in park.
-Get out.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.598
-You're firing me?
-Get out.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.701
-Are you serious? You're driving?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

08:22.903 --> 08:23.904
Noey.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.393
-Oh, look out.
-Now, be careful.

09:23.830 --> 09:24.665
Hey!

10:01.201 --> 10:03.937
Honestly, I've been seeing
this bouncy castle

10:04.071 --> 10:06.707
in their yard
since I was eight years old.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.643
And I've always wanted to go.
I think we just go.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.744
Let's do it.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.348
My God, there's children in it!

10:14.414 --> 10:15.282
Hi, guys.

10:15.349 --> 10:18.852
-You should ask them.
-Can we come bounce with you?

10:18.919 --> 10:21.121
We wanna know if we could get in
with you guys.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.824
-OK.
-I can't believe you're gonna do this.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.694
This is the best ever.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.963
I can't believe y'all have this
in your yard. Dang!

10:34.268 --> 10:35.702
You want my hat? You wanna wear it?

10:36.670 --> 10:38.372
Oh, my God.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.107
Oh!

10:41.175 --> 10:42.276
Mom!

10:51.118 --> 10:52.819
OK, we're out, guys.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.289
Noah, you finally got to jump
in the house.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.391
That was the best thing ever.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.411
F***!

11:43.937 --> 11:48.675
Hey-hey!

12:13.166 --> 12:17.271
Can we please go pick up Trace and Braison
so I'm not alone back here?

12:18.438 --> 12:20.340
Look,
there's those handsome devils.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.075
There they are, right there!

12:22.075 --> 12:23.076
Hey!

12:23.110 --> 12:24.678
Get in, losers, we're going shopping.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.947
-Let's go, guys.
-I'm gonna get in the back.

12:30.784 --> 12:31.919
Oh, my God.

12:31.985 --> 12:35.088
I love how the person that gave birth
to all of you except one

12:35.155 --> 12:36.890
is crammed into the back corner.

12:36.957 --> 12:41.328
Can you believe we're all here, everyone's
in from Nashville out in LA together?

12:41.395 --> 12:43.997
Half of us are always in Nashville,
half are always here.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.132
Go!

12:45.199 --> 12:47.534
We're in the same car, guys.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.572
-Oh, yeah.
-I'd put a splash of volume on that one.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.006
-This song's hella-crazy.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.051
-Trace, you have to sing it.
-You have to.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.385
It's very creepy.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.798
-That's so creepy.
-That's creepy.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.255
Daddy's doin' the shimmy.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.733
-Whoo!
-Man, that song is infectious.

13:52.799 --> 13:56.470
-Is this the whole family?
-This is the whole family.

13:56.537 --> 13:59.439
-Shh, fath, fath, fath.
-Yes?

13:59.506 --> 14:02.776
-My thinking things are going off.
-I hear you, girl, what's your idea?

14:02.843 --> 14:06.346
I'm thinking 'cause the last time we took
a family photo was Christmas,

14:06.413 --> 14:08.448
so I think we should go do one.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.850
-Let's do it.
-Oh, boy.

14:17.658 --> 14:19.126
Hey!

14:19.193 --> 14:21.461
Where are we going? Right here?
Family photo.

14:21.528 --> 14:25.632
-Cyrus Family photo.
-Oh, my God, this is insane.

14:25.699 --> 14:29.069
-Oh, I love these.
-Hand me the basketball.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.470
Mom, you do need the wings.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.173
This is not far off from
one of my normal photo shoots.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.944
-Oh!
-All right, guys, on three.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.545
One, two, and three.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.315
Awesome, guys
We love each other, big smiles.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.283
-We don't, though.
-We don't!

14:43.350 --> 14:45.986
Perfect. Let's change it up a little bit.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.287
Change it up.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.723
On three, guys. One, two, and three.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.294
Awesome. Perfect.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.901
Awesome, guys.

15:01.535 --> 15:03.170
Love it.

15:03.237 --> 15:04.671
Oh, my God.

15:04.738 --> 15:08.308
-Show them how it's done, brother.
-Oh God, I wish this was real.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.043
Get it, MC.

15:10.611 --> 15:13.046
That is amazing.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.283
Only Dad could put that on
and look absolutely amazing.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.684
Oh, my God.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.053
Dad's getting laid for sure tonight.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.393
Braison's gonna drive.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.563
Oh, shoot.

15:29.630 --> 15:31.698
A little louder,
a little louder.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.037
Five, six, seven, eight.

16:27.888 --> 16:29.857
Guys,
I think we can officially say

16:29.923 --> 16:33.060
the Cyrus Family Reunion is over.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.095
That was one
of the best days ever.
