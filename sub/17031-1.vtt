00:12.879 --> 00:14.654
<i>Just like everybody else</i>

00:14.814 --> 00:17.658
<i>I've got a story</i>

00:18.284 --> 00:20.491
<i>I don't know how to say it nice</i>

00:20.587 --> 00:23.693
<i>I shine it up and make it glisten</i>

00:23.990 --> 00:28.871
<i>All I know is I believe and it's reassuring</i>

00:29.662 --> 00:34.304
<i>When I was out, when I was down,
somebody told me something</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:39.916
<i>So simple but I follow it till this day</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:42.782

<i>I know what you might be thinking</i>

00:54.788 --> 00:56.859
<i>That'll never work for me</i>

00:57.290 --> 00:59.292
<i>Too young, too old, too poor</i>

<i>They're just excuses</i>

Em! Emma! Emma!

03:10.490 --> 03:13.494
Come on, Em. We gotta get to the rink.
Get the door.

03:13.593 --> 03:15.766
You should have seen
what happened today.

03:15.895 --> 03:19.035
Twenty-two kids got sent home
from school with lice.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.203
Benefits of tea tree oil.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.076
- Ew.
- Would you rather get lice?

03:25.305 --> 03:26.875
What's with the boxes?

03:26.973 --> 03:28.453
Mind your own business, kiddo.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.123
Really?

03:38.418 --> 03:42.457
Em, get in the driver's seat, key on,
pedal to the metal when I say.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.727
Got it.

03:46.693 --> 03:47.693
Hit it!

04:06.179 --> 04:09.592
I know this hasn't been easy for you
and how badly you need the funding,

04:09.682 --> 04:12.390
so skate clean, it's yours.

04:12.485 --> 04:13.657
I will.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.801
<i>That was a great skate
for Odessa Patterson.</i>

04:18.891 --> 04:19.892
<i>Here's your score...</i>

04:19.993 --> 04:20.994
You see my mom yet?

04:21.127 --> 04:23.869
Stay focused, Mattie,
you know what's at stake.

04:23.963 --> 04:27.308
Okay, this is your year
and don't overthink the triple lutz.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.813
You nailed it in warm up,
don't rush the take off.

04:30.903 --> 04:35.010
<i>And our next competitor
representing the Toronto Skating Club,</i>

04:35.108 --> 04:36.712
is Mattie Dane.

04:37.076 --> 04:38.851
You've got this, girl.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.220
Hurry!

05:33.433 --> 05:34.878
Stay focused, Mattie.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.611
Here we go, Mattie.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.182
Oh.

05:45.211 --> 05:46.246
Mattie!

05:51.551 --> 05:52.552
Go.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.833
The poor kid had a shot
at getting a free ride, a grant.

06:02.628 --> 06:05.199
She only needed to be <i>in</i> the tap five.

06:05.298 --> 06:08.905
<i>She was the best one on the ice.
She's worked so hard.</i>

06:09.001 --> 06:10.912
<i>I've seen her land that jump 100 times.</i>

06:11.003 --> 06:12.003
So, how bad is it?

06:12.071 --> 06:15.211
Torn meniscus,
no skating for 12 weeks, then rehab.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.879
<i>No, I mean, your financial situation.</i>

06:18.845 --> 06:20.085
Four months behind on rent.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.793
Is there any severance pay?

06:22.882 --> 06:25.089
From a used car lot, are you kidding me?

06:25.518 --> 06:27.122
Bummer.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.996
Okay, desperate times,
desperate measures.

06:30.089 --> 06:32.695
Pack your bags, kiddo.
You and the girls are moving in with me.

06:32.792 --> 06:36.604
We can't do that. The girls are in school.
Our lives are here.

06:36.996 --> 06:39.704
<i>Appreciate the offer. I'll make it work.</i>

06:40.600 --> 06:42.705
I made the honor roll in high school.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.352
No, no college degree.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.749
Yes, I know I haven't worked
in a medical office,

06:52.845 --> 06:54.290
but I'm real good with people.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.859
I'm real good with people.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.950
I'm real good with people.

06:59.786 --> 07:03.598
Okay.
Okay, I understand.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.669
I did teach some fitness classes in my 20s,

07:06.993 --> 07:09.599
and actually I did fitness modeling.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.872
How old am I?

07:13.766 --> 07:15.768
- Kelly Dane?
- Yeah.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.643
You have been served.

07:19.572 --> 07:22.781
Seventy-two hours to vacate the premises?

07:22.875 --> 07:25.321
Are you kidding me? Hey, hey!

07:30.082 --> 07:32.460
I could use a little help out here!

07:32.552 --> 07:34.930
I thought Aunt Ginger lived in New York.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.932
She retired and moved back home.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.367
Yeah, she gave up her promising
musical theater career.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.396
Hey, at least she gave it a shot.

07:41.494 --> 07:43.303
Forty years is more than a shot.

07:47.099 --> 07:49.579
- How far is Sudbury?
- Four boring hours.

07:49.669 --> 07:52.650
There's a car dealership up there
I think I can get a job at.

07:52.738 --> 07:53.910
What about my skating?

07:54.006 --> 07:55.679
We're dealing with a serious injury here.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.448
I can still get better for Nationals.

07:57.543 --> 08:00.114
Baby, we just can't
afford skating right now.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.385
Don't do this to me!

08:01.514 --> 08:03.653
It's not all about you, Mattie.

08:03.749 --> 08:05.861
We're all gonna have to pitch in
and make some compromises.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.421
Yeah, 'cause you can't keep a job.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.566
- That's not fair.
- This isn't fair.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.000
Life is not fair, Mattie.

08:13.359 --> 08:14.861
Get used to it.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.142
Hey, check this out.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.236
Are you cold?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.043
Hey, hey, Emma, Mattie!

09:01.541 --> 09:03.585
All right, it's been a good month,
but not a great month,

09:03.609 --> 09:06.188
so I'm gonna do something
to shake up the sales team a little bit.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.159
I got someone new coming in...
Oh, thanks for showing up, guys.

09:09.248 --> 09:12.252
- Oh, no, no, you're giving her a job?
- A job here with us?

09:12.351 --> 09:14.353
- Yes.
- She's not a local.

09:14.654 --> 09:15.997
She got no customer base here.

09:16.088 --> 09:19.592
Yeah, who's she gonna call?
She's got like no customers. Zero.

09:19.692 --> 09:21.694
Actually, she's from here.

09:22.094 --> 09:23.402
- She is?
- Yeah.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.374
Okay, but we've got
a pretty tight team here.

09:26.465 --> 09:28.505
Yeah. You know what an import
would do to this team?

09:28.601 --> 09:30.376
Yeah, make it better.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.684
Okay. Okay look, I got an idea.

09:35.608 --> 09:38.885
She doesn't make a sale in 30 days,
she gotta go.

09:40.112 --> 09:41.113
Give her 60 days.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.886
- Thirty days.
- Bam!

09:43.382 --> 09:45.089
Thirty days, gone.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.387
She can do it.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.591
Okay, but if she doesn't, she's gone.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.224
Fair bet? Huh?

09:51.624 --> 09:53.399
Huh?

09:53.492 --> 09:54.664
Bet? Bet?

09:55.161 --> 09:57.232
Bet. Bet.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.571
All right. All right.
All right, it's a bet.

09:59.665 --> 10:01.508
- All right.
- All right.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.046
Jerry.

10:03.135 --> 10:04.135
- What?
- Go.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.843
- Oh.
- Just go. Meeting is over, guys.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.416
Wow, look at the houses.

10:14.513 --> 10:16.891
Everyone must be rich on this street.

10:16.983 --> 10:18.724
Is everyone rich in Sudbury?

10:18.818 --> 10:20.161
Is Aunt Ginger rich?

10:20.252 --> 10:21.287
Hardly.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.230
I don't know. She did all right.

10:23.322 --> 10:24.460
Better than we have.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.902
Lighten up, Mattie.
We've got our health and each other.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.496
That ain't bad.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.142
- Ls this Aunt Ginger's?
- Yeah.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.768
I love it.

10:36.235 --> 10:38.313
All right.
Just leave the bags in the car, okay?

10:38.337 --> 10:40.214
We'll go in and say hi.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.588
Auntie Ginger?

10:45.311 --> 10:47.382
Auntie Ginger, are you here?

10:48.681 --> 10:51.855
She's not even home, Mom.
Really nice welcome.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.158
Mattie, give it a break, geez.

10:54.253 --> 10:55.288
Language!

10:55.388 --> 10:56.890
<i>I said, "Geez."</i>

11:07.133 --> 11:08.133
You girls hungry?

11:15.574 --> 11:16.882
Girls, we gotta go shopping.

11:16.976 --> 11:20.947
Oh, crap, I wanted to be here
when you got here.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.492
Auntie Ginger.

11:22.581 --> 11:23.582
Aw. Hello.

11:24.116 --> 11:26.289
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't mention it.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.597
This must be Emma.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.170
You're as pretty as your mom.

11:34.126 --> 11:38.336
Well, not as pretty as me
at your age, but still very pretty.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.431
Aw.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.311
And, is this Mattie?

11:43.436 --> 11:46.849
Holy mother of God, look at you.

11:46.939 --> 11:49.920
I remember when all you did was
crap your pants and pick your nose.

11:52.912 --> 11:55.791
Aw, you poor thing. How you feeling?

11:55.881 --> 11:56.881
Hello?

11:57.283 --> 11:58.489
Who's this?

11:58.584 --> 12:00.564
<i>- Emma, who's this?
- It's Louis.</i>

12:00.653 --> 12:02.257
<i>- Louis the car guy?
- Yeah.</i>

12:02.354 --> 12:04.698
<i>My mom can sell anything
with four wheels and an engine.</i>

12:04.790 --> 12:05.990
Yeah, sure she can.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.162
<i>- Louis?
- Kelly.7</i>

12:09.328 --> 12:10.363
Yes.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.500
Oh, it's so good to hear your voice.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.371
You, too.

12:14.533 --> 12:18.948
I hope you two kids like your rooms.
I've had so much fun fixing them up.

12:19.038 --> 12:23.680
Okay, we're gonna get you settled
and then presents for all.

12:24.844 --> 12:27.450
- Did she say presents?
- She's trying to buy us.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.350
I can be bought.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.430
It seems like just yesterday
we were in high school together, right?

12:33.486 --> 12:35.989
<i>When are we gonna see you
down at the shop?</i>

12:36.088 --> 12:38.500
<i>Yeah, I wanna get you starting
to do sales right away, right?</i>

12:38.591 --> 12:40.502
You mean, I have the job?

12:40.693 --> 12:44.038
Uh... Of course, you have the job.
Are you kidding me?

12:44.330 --> 12:45.650
I'll see you Monday morning then.

12:45.731 --> 12:48.302
Ah. Gosh, this is swell.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.744
<i>I can 't believe you 're here.
Okay, see you Monday.</i>

12:50.836 --> 12:53.043
Ciao. Bye.

12:55.641 --> 12:57.211
She's back, yes!

12:57.777 --> 13:01.850
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

13:02.014 --> 13:03.186
Yes!

13:06.485 --> 13:09.432
And this is your room.

13:17.363 --> 13:18.501
Really?

13:19.498 --> 13:21.444
This is for a four-year-old.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.945
Have you guys seen my room?

13:27.106 --> 13:29.382
Never mind. Yours is way worse.

13:31.243 --> 13:32.722
You can make it your own.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.190
Aunt Ginger just redid it for me.

13:43.422 --> 13:45.663
You know what, Mom?
This really sucks.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.999
We really didn't have a
choice, Mattie Dane.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.403
- You ruined my life.
- I did not.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.134
You were this close to being funded.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.551
You're the one that fell, not me.

13:53.599 --> 13:54.669
Mom!

13:54.767 --> 13:57.680
I can't believe you just said that.

13:59.104 --> 14:00.104
I'm sorry.

14:01.273 --> 14:02.273
I'm sorry.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.341
It's okay.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.091
Okay, very calm, very relaxed, okay?

14:09.181 --> 14:14.597
Be a good girl, Rose, and frown.

14:18.557 --> 14:21.333
You would not believe
who I just saw at the grocery store.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.634
- Who?
- No, you can't move, Rose.

14:23.729 --> 14:24.901
Who?

14:24.997 --> 14:26.670
- Can this wait?
- No.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.142
Kelly Dane.

14:28.667 --> 14:29.667
- Rose!
- Kelly?

14:29.735 --> 14:31.180
- Kelly Dane?
- Yeah.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.147
- Give us a minute.
- Yes.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.185
- At the grocery store, herein town?
- Yes.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.276
She had two kids with her.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.377
How'd she look?

14:38.510 --> 14:39.716
Amazing.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.620
I mean, okay.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.923
Is she just visiting or is she moving back?

14:46.018 --> 14:47.190
I don't know.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.357
Forget it, never mind.
I'll find out myself.

14:49.622 --> 14:52.694
Okay, Dr. Schacter,
you can come back in now.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.205
I'll be a good girl!

15:14.446 --> 15:16.255
<i>- You got something?
- Yeah.</i>

15:16.348 --> 15:17.520
<i>Good, good.</i>

15:17.616 --> 15:19.127
The kid's here.
You want me to collect on the debt?

15:19.151 --> 15:20.151
<i>No, not yet.</i>

15:20.219 --> 15:25.191
<i>Now that we know he's at the rink, go see
his old man first if he's not in jail.</i>

16:34.126 --> 16:36.299
See, easy as pie.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.136
Mercury!

16:40.666 --> 16:43.613
Mercury, that choreography was all off.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.909
You're showing her bad technique.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.918
The double axel was weak. The butterfly...

16:49.008 --> 16:51.215
And the flying camel was way off!

16:51.310 --> 16:52.311
No, it wasn't.

16:53.312 --> 16:54.416
Yes, it was.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.753
Yes, it was. Most definitely.

16:57.649 --> 16:58.923
Can you do it again, please?

16:59.018 --> 17:00.018
Rose...

17:00.085 --> 17:02.190
- Do it again.
- I'm done.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.303
Sorry, kiddo. Good luck.

17:11.997 --> 17:15.705
Don't worry about it, Heather,
we're better off without him.

17:15.934 --> 17:18.311
Just... Let's do it again, sweetie.

17:18.404 --> 17:19.541
Music!

17:28.580 --> 17:33.051
<i>We move blindly to the light</i>

17:38.924 --> 17:41.871
<i>Even though we don't know what's inside</i>

17:43.228 --> 17:48.576
<i>Like a diamond, we will shine</i>

17:50.469 --> 17:57.114
<i>Within this life, we don't make time
for all the simple things</i>

17:57.876 --> 18:01.517
<i>When a princess pulls with gold</i>

18:01.680 --> 18:05.127
<i>Like kings and queens on pedestals</i>

18:05.484 --> 18:07.987
<i>The shadow of the soul</i>

18:08.087 --> 18:10.328
<i>Can make the soul look silly</i>

19:27.499 --> 19:28.499
Wow!

19:29.034 --> 19:34.313
- Wow!
- Not, "Wow." Better, but not, "Wow."

19:40.179 --> 19:42.989
Heather. Heather, stop!

19:43.282 --> 19:44.317
Heather, stop!

19:51.356 --> 19:54.030
Excuse me, whoever you are.
This is private ice.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.130
Oh, sorry.

19:56.261 --> 19:59.765
Where's Mercury?
Mercury? Mercury? Mercury?

19:59.865 --> 20:01.970
- Honey, it's okay. I have it.
- Oh.

20:02.401 --> 20:05.473
Mercury, this is private ice, is it not?

20:05.871 --> 20:07.009
I'll take care of this.

20:07.105 --> 20:08.985
Mercury, can you have
that girl removed, please?

20:09.041 --> 20:10.679
And lock the door behind her.

20:13.145 --> 20:16.388
Can't do that, Rose. Fire regs.
Plus, your hour's up.

20:16.481 --> 20:18.620
I'm sorry,
but we lost four minutes because of this.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.565
You can pick it up on the next session.

20:22.921 --> 20:24.730
Okay, that's all right. Thank you, Mercury.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.703
It's not all right.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.999
And what are you thanking him for?
We paid for the ice.

20:35.601 --> 20:36.601
She's good.

20:38.437 --> 20:39.507
Okay.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.146
Good's relative.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.345
Haven't seen you before.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.154
Just moved here from Toronto.

20:45.811 --> 20:46.812
You skate?

20:49.214 --> 20:50.215
I did.

20:52.217 --> 20:53.787
Injury or money?

20:57.222 --> 20:58.223
Both.

20:59.224 --> 21:00.294
Yeah, figures.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.365
Do you have a coach in Toronto?

21:05.464 --> 21:07.501
Yeah, Pat Whillikey.

21:07.599 --> 21:08.599
Pat's not bad.

21:08.900 --> 21:09.901
You know her?

21:10.002 --> 21:12.312
Yeah, I worked with her a long time ago.

21:12.771 --> 21:13.977
You planning a comeback?

21:16.642 --> 21:17.882
Probably not.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.413
Well, you shouldn't have come
into this place.

21:21.513 --> 21:23.220
The smell gets you every time.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.427
Yeah, I should probably get going.

21:29.721 --> 21:30.791
Hey, kid.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.460
Mattie.

21:32.557 --> 21:35.128
If you wanna coach,
I got a tiny tykes program tomorrow.

21:35.227 --> 21:36.535
Regular coach is sick.

21:36.695 --> 21:39.005
Don't even need your skates,
30 bucks an hour.

21:39.097 --> 21:42.271
4:30 sharp. A minute late, you're fired.

21:42.401 --> 21:43.471
Okay.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.346
Thanks.

22:22.274 --> 22:24.515
Uh, I'll see you later.

22:27.746 --> 22:29.054
Are you lost?

22:29.147 --> 22:30.524
Yeah, first day.

22:30.615 --> 22:31.855
Do you know where 2C is?

22:32.351 --> 22:33.762
- Heather.
- Mattie.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.024
Follow me, Mattie.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.391
So, didn't I see you at
the rink last night?

22:38.490 --> 22:40.470
Yeah. You're a great skater.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.163
Thanks, I know.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.766
So, this is it.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.571
All right, here you go.

22:51.336 --> 22:53.338
Oh. Hi, guys.

22:53.438 --> 22:57.250
Uh, Kelly, this is Ben and Jerry,
two of our key salesmen.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.419
Uh, guys, this is Kelly.

22:59.511 --> 23:01.923
So, you're the import, huh?

23:02.214 --> 23:04.023
No, no, wait, you're from here.

23:04.116 --> 23:08.531
No, no, you were from here,
but now you're not from here.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.156
We hear you think you're pretty hot.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.502
Well, so as you know,
we're pretty hot, too.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.767
Keep up the good work there, boys.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.705
- See ya.
- Wouldn't want to be ya.

23:20.699 --> 23:21.973
Oh, nice legs.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.673
- Bros first, man!
- No, I get ya. No ups for her.

23:24.803 --> 23:28.751
- Still, that's something.
- It is impressive, yes.

23:28.874 --> 23:30.547
They seem interesting.

23:30.642 --> 23:33.418
Well, appearances
can be deceiving.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.725
This is a fabulous dealership.

23:35.814 --> 23:37.555
Oh, thanks a lot.

23:37.649 --> 23:40.255
And this is yours.

23:40.485 --> 23:42.158
- Huh?
- Wow.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.598
- Yeah, pretty good, right?
- Yeah.

23:43.622 --> 23:45.101
Spelled it okay.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.067
Uh, coffee? Tea? Me?

23:48.760 --> 23:51.240
- That's a joke, right?
- No thanks. I'm good.

23:52.697 --> 23:53.937
So, how are you?

23:54.032 --> 23:56.069
No doubt, settled down, partnered up, kids?

23:56.168 --> 23:58.114
No, no, no, no, no.

23:58.303 --> 24:00.943
I guess I never got over
you breaking my heart.

24:03.809 --> 24:06.050
- This is great.
- It is.

24:06.144 --> 24:08.556
- Shall we get down to business?
- Uh, right, yeah. Uh...

24:08.647 --> 24:10.957
Your draw down against sales
will be $600 a week.

24:11.483 --> 24:12.518
Oh.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.289
Is that okay?

24:14.386 --> 24:15.626
Oh, yeah.

24:15.720 --> 24:19.759
And, um, there's no need to cause
any trouble right off the bat, right?

24:21.393 --> 24:22.701
Excuse me?

24:22.894 --> 24:24.237
Your skirt.

24:24.896 --> 24:25.966
What about my skirt?

24:26.198 --> 24:27.768
It's a little short.

24:27.866 --> 24:29.675
You know, the four Ps?

24:30.101 --> 24:31.171
Sorry, the four Ps?

24:31.269 --> 24:33.909
Prudent to appear
as professional as possible.

24:35.106 --> 24:36.141
That's three Ps.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.280
- No, it isn't.
- Yeah.

24:38.376 --> 24:41.186
Prudent, professional, possible. Three.

24:41.379 --> 24:45.088
Well, I always counted appear to be a P.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.531
You know, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

24:48.620 --> 24:49.690
Appear is an A.

24:50.455 --> 24:51.934
- So, how long do I have?
- What?

24:52.023 --> 24:54.183
How long do I have
before I have to make my first sale?

24:54.326 --> 24:58.331
- Uh, well...
- It's okay, Louis. I'm a pro.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.431
Thirty days.

25:01.366 --> 25:02.470
No problem.

25:08.373 --> 25:09.784
He's always looking at me.

25:09.875 --> 25:10.910
Who?

25:11.476 --> 25:13.251
Him. Darcy.

25:13.345 --> 25:17.122
But he's trouble. As in, stay away from.

25:17.916 --> 25:21.762
Well, his dad is in and out of jail
and his mom disappeared a few years ago.

25:22.787 --> 25:24.698
And last year, he beat
up this kid really bad.

25:24.823 --> 25:26.393
Like, really bad.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.978
So, what brought you to Sudbury?

25:36.835 --> 25:38.109
My mom got a job here.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.649
- Here?
- Yeah, believe it or not.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.420
Are you getting ready for Sectionals?

25:44.676 --> 25:46.713
- Yeah, you skate?
- I did.

25:47.145 --> 25:49.716
I bombed out at regionals, injured my knee.

25:51.650 --> 25:54.090
Sorry to hear about your knee,
but it is cool that you skated.

25:54.119 --> 25:55.621
We have a lot in common.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.893
Hi, I'm Portia.
I'm the school social convener.

25:57.989 --> 25:59.059
Mattie.

25:59.157 --> 26:01.102
I just have a couple questions
to get you on the right track.

26:01.126 --> 26:02.161
"Track?"

26:02.260 --> 26:07.642
So, do you qualify yourself as a jock,
goth, emo, raver, motorhead or a princess?

26:08.066 --> 26:09.066
Princess, right?

26:11.870 --> 26:14.544
Uh, I see it.

26:21.479 --> 26:24.119
Been a while, Mercury. You coaching?

26:24.215 --> 26:26.058
No, but I ran into
one of your skaters though.

26:26.151 --> 26:27.789
Let me guess, Mattie Dane.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.490
<i>Yeah, seems like a good kid.</i>

26:29.588 --> 26:33.695
Oh, yeah. No, she's got it.
I hated losing her.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.170
If she gets her knee back,
she can go all the way.

26:36.294 --> 26:37.864
<i>She's that good.</i>

26:37.963 --> 26:39.135
Thanks.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.951
Okay, so let's make two lines.

27:23.975 --> 27:27.513
What we're gonna do,
push once and glide on one foot.

27:29.347 --> 27:31.054
And, under.

27:33.318 --> 27:36.094
Good job, good work.

27:37.155 --> 27:40.227
Sadie, when you feel like you're
off balance, don't go like this.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.363
That'll make you want to go
like this or like that.

27:43.461 --> 27:46.704
So keep your feet like straight
and your knees over your toes, okay?

27:46.798 --> 27:49.779
There you go. See? Nice work.

27:49.868 --> 27:52.075
Here. I'm here if you need me.

27:53.138 --> 27:54.674
That's a lot better.

27:54.773 --> 27:56.810
And then arms out for balance.

27:56.908 --> 27:58.854
Go around. There you go.

27:59.611 --> 28:00.988
That's good.

28:01.212 --> 28:02.953
<i>Just let it out</i>

28:03.081 --> 28:05.391
<i>Nothing wrong with that, just let it out</i>

28:05.483 --> 28:07.622
<i>Jump, just let it out</i>

28:07.786 --> 28:08.924
<i>Don 't keep it inside</i>

28:09.020 --> 28:10.431
<i>Just let it out</i>

28:10.522 --> 28:12.365
<i>Shout, just let it out</i>

28:12.924 --> 28:15.200
<i>Nothing wrong with that, just let it out</i>

28:15.293 --> 28:17.534
<i>Shout, just let it out</i>

28:18.797 --> 28:20.902
<i>Just let it out</i>

28:26.304 --> 28:28.580
How'd your knee feel out there?

28:28.840 --> 28:30.046
Not bad.

28:31.076 --> 28:32.749
It hurt, didn't it?

28:32.844 --> 28:33.914
Yeah.

28:34.646 --> 28:37.354
Yeah, you're doing more than you should.

28:38.950 --> 28:40.486
So, what are you doing for rehab?

28:40.585 --> 28:41.723
Cycling.

28:41.820 --> 28:43.356
No, that's not enough.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.763
It's free.

28:47.826 --> 28:49.203
Is that you?

28:50.228 --> 28:51.298
Yeah.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.771
Who's that with you?

28:54.299 --> 28:55.573
My wife.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.271
She was a skater?

29:00.905 --> 29:02.407
Yeah, she was great.

29:04.976 --> 29:07.047
- Are you guys still married?
- No.

29:07.779 --> 29:09.053
I'm sorry.

29:09.814 --> 29:10.815
Forty bucks.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.361
- You were good with the kids today.
- Thank you.

29:13.451 --> 29:15.055
- Are you available Thursday?
- Yeah.

29:15.153 --> 29:17.133
4:30 sharp, don't be late.

29:17.222 --> 29:18.332
You might as well leave your skates here.

29:18.356 --> 29:19.960
There's some lockers in the back, okay?

29:20.058 --> 29:21.058
Thanks.

29:25.497 --> 29:26.601
I saw you set up to jump.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.370
You chickened out.

29:42.647 --> 29:45.253
Ugh. Crap, my mom's coming home.

29:45.350 --> 29:46.727
I love your house.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.729
Yeah, Mom had it custom built.

29:48.820 --> 29:51.824
Are you hungry, 'cause I'm starving?

29:52.490 --> 29:54.834
Here, have some. Dig in.

29:54.993 --> 29:58.440
- How often do you have private ice?
- Like five days a week.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.737
Oh, sorry, and I do regular sessions, too.

30:00.932 --> 30:04.675
Well, it's Mercury's dinky rink
and he only offers three a week.

30:04.769 --> 30:07.716
Mostly intermediate girls.
It's so annoying.

30:08.706 --> 30:10.617
I can trust you, right?

30:11.009 --> 30:12.147
Yeah.

30:12.243 --> 30:14.188
Well, I'd love to get your opinion
on some of my dresses.

30:14.212 --> 30:16.852
My mom and I are always fighting over
what I should wear.

30:16.948 --> 30:19.724
She's burned through like four designers.

30:21.286 --> 30:22.492
Come on.

30:27.525 --> 30:30.734
- Your room is really great.
- Thanks.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.467
What do you think?

30:33.665 --> 30:34.666
Gorgeous.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.277
I know, silly, but which one do you like?

30:36.301 --> 30:40.215
Heather. Oh, what are you doing?

30:40.305 --> 30:42.751
Um, Mom, this is Mattie.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.385
Wait, didn't I see you at the rink?

30:44.409 --> 30:45.581
Sorry about that.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.156
You must be new in town.

30:47.245 --> 30:49.282
Yeah, but my mom's from here.

30:49.414 --> 30:51.655
- Oh. So it's Mattie...
- Dane.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.019
Dane.

30:55.119 --> 30:57.861
I was getting Mattie's opinion
on some of my dresses.

30:58.056 --> 30:59.399
Do you think it really matters?

30:59.924 --> 31:02.837
Well, Mattie skates or she used to.

31:02.927 --> 31:05.305
She got injured at sub sectionals.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.869
So you skate.

31:07.498 --> 31:08.602
I did.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.539
Hello?

31:15.607 --> 31:17.780
It's Mercury.
Can you make it over to the rink?

31:18.643 --> 31:20.520
<i>- Now?
- Yeah, I've got some ice time.</i>

31:38.229 --> 31:40.832
Okay, do you see the
figure eight tracings?

31:40.857 --> 31:41.723
Yeah.

31:41.799 --> 31:43.540
Good. You follow 'em.

31:44.335 --> 31:46.144
Why am I following them?

31:46.237 --> 31:51.186
It's called, "Patch." Old school exercises.
It's all your knee can handle right now.

31:51.276 --> 31:55.918
Eyes on the tracing,
arms checked, knees soft.

31:56.014 --> 31:57.254
Go ahead.

31:59.884 --> 32:02.660
Tighten up your center,
you look like a Jell-O sandwich.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.530
How long do I have to keep on doing this?

32:06.224 --> 32:07.931
You got 40 minutes.

32:08.192 --> 32:10.399
Oh. Great.

32:10.495 --> 32:13.032
You don't like it, you can get off.

32:17.168 --> 32:19.008
Okay, keep it going. I'll
be back in a minute.

33:08.419 --> 33:11.093
Darcy, it's for you.

33:14.392 --> 33:15.462
Yeah.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.137
<i>How are you?</i>

33:17.428 --> 33:18.463
I'm okay.

33:18.563 --> 33:20.007
<i>Hey, I was wondering
if you could bring</i>

33:20.031 --> 33:23.205
<i>some money down to the jail tomorrow.</i>

33:23.768 --> 33:26.612
Dad, I don't want to do this anymore, okay?

33:27.438 --> 33:31.443
I love you, but I just want you
to leave me alone.

33:31.542 --> 33:32.850
I'm sorry.

33:43.554 --> 33:44.828
What'd you fall doing Patch?

33:46.190 --> 33:47.191
No.

33:47.892 --> 33:51.032
Didn't think so. What happened?

33:51.596 --> 33:55.100
I lined up for a jump and I just...
I couldn't do it.

33:55.199 --> 34:00.171
I skated right through it and I was scared.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.642
No one said it would be easy.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.045
I don't think I can do it.

34:22.159 --> 34:26.540
There comes a time for everyone,
no matter who they are, to quit.

34:29.634 --> 34:31.806
Maybe it's that time for you.

34:33.871 --> 34:37.318
Yeah, I think it is.

34:41.344 --> 34:42.652
It's okay.

34:44.916 --> 34:48.261
It's okay, kiddo.
Come on, I'll give you a lift home.

35:27.258 --> 35:29.033
- Surprise!
- Oh.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.970
- For you.
- How thoughtful.

35:31.062 --> 35:32.439
I think so.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.773
- Well, would you like to come in?
- Yes. Gosh, yeah.

35:48.012 --> 35:52.017
Louis, I'm really so grateful for the job
and everything you've done for me.

35:52.116 --> 35:53.288
Like it...

35:53.384 --> 35:56.058
- But, Louis, this isn't working.
- Why not?

35:56.420 --> 35:57.490
We dated in grade 10.

35:57.588 --> 35:58.965
The best year of my life.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.999
- We were 15.
- Yeah, you were my first...

36:01.092 --> 36:02.298
Kiss.

36:02.793 --> 36:03.863
Yeah.

36:09.934 --> 36:11.572
Shucks, I'm sorry.

36:12.603 --> 36:14.173
You haven't changed a bit.

36:15.039 --> 36:17.815
The same spiky hair,
the awe shucks expressions.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.547
- That's a good thing, right?
- Mmm.

36:20.278 --> 36:22.224
- Look, I can change.
- No, I like you.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.018
But... But friends.

36:25.249 --> 36:27.126
Can we just be friends?

36:28.286 --> 36:29.356
Sure.

36:33.224 --> 36:34.828
Excuse me, sorry.

36:35.293 --> 36:37.569
I'd better go see what that is.

36:48.506 --> 36:52.147
I'd really like to keep
on coaching the kids.

36:52.243 --> 36:54.723
Yeah, that would... That'd be fine.

36:59.150 --> 37:00.151
Your mom?

37:01.185 --> 37:02.255
Yeah.

37:03.688 --> 37:07.192
Mom, this is Mercury.
He gave me the job at the rink.

37:07.291 --> 37:08.929
Kelly.

37:09.026 --> 37:10.903
That doesn't sound good.
How old is this truck?

37:13.631 --> 37:14.666
Old.

37:16.434 --> 37:18.710
- Let's see if we can get it started.
- Yeah.

37:26.477 --> 37:29.117
Okay. Okay. Okay.

37:37.021 --> 37:39.194
You should come down and see me.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.092
Palladino Honda!

37:41.826 --> 37:43.169
Great idea!

37:43.794 --> 37:45.398
We got a sale on!

37:45.496 --> 37:46.873
Okay, I can't breathe.

37:46.964 --> 37:48.671
Okay, pop the clutch.

37:51.869 --> 37:52.904
Whoa.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.951
I gotta start working out.
I gotta start working out, okay.

38:05.316 --> 38:08.661
Now take your ring finger
and put it on the third string.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.096
Also on the second fret, just like that.
That's it.

38:11.188 --> 38:12.766
That's A minor. Got that.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.035
All right, so now, the second chord,
this one's really easy.

38:15.059 --> 38:16.902
It's literally only two strings.

38:16.994 --> 38:18.735
Hey, you did get it.

38:19.063 --> 38:20.508
There you go.

38:21.332 --> 38:22.333
Nice one.

38:22.433 --> 38:27.507
Now take your ring finger,
just one more up, there we go, to the D.

38:27.638 --> 38:28.776
There you go. Nice one.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.240
Hey, Mattie.

38:30.808 --> 38:31.808
Hey, Heather.

38:31.876 --> 38:33.184
Had private ice this morning.

38:33.277 --> 38:37.191
Nailed my triple lutz, five in a row.
I'm so happy.

38:37.281 --> 38:39.352
Hey, do you wanna come
to my house after school?

38:51.696 --> 38:53.607
Darcy, good to see you.

38:54.398 --> 38:57.208
This thing ain't going away.
Don't make it worse.

38:57.301 --> 38:59.907
- Get off me, man.
- Don't make it worse.

39:00.204 --> 39:01.979
Hey. what's going on?

39:02.406 --> 39:04.079
- It's okay, Mere.
- Ls it?

39:05.910 --> 39:07.981
It doesn't look okay.

39:10.881 --> 39:12.451
Darcy here owes us money.

39:13.751 --> 39:15.287
That true, Da roe?

39:15.386 --> 39:16.694
My father owes them.

39:16.787 --> 39:17.788
$1,200.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.633
Dad's in jail again, debt goes to the kid.

39:28.499 --> 39:29.569
Mere.

39:31.335 --> 39:32.335
$700.

39:32.403 --> 39:35.316
You give it to Mo, you
tell him it's square.

39:43.247 --> 39:44.851
I don't think so.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.959
This is my house.

39:49.553 --> 39:52.557
No one comes into my house
and threatens anyone.

40:00.965 --> 40:03.377
Your move. Make it.

40:22.686 --> 40:23.686
You got lucky.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.662
Let's go.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.029
I'm sorry, Mere.

40:30.494 --> 40:33.737
Da roe, you got any problems,
you come to me.

40:33.831 --> 40:35.105
Yeah, yeah.

40:41.539 --> 40:43.314
Hey.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.421
Did you see the hair?

40:50.514 --> 40:51.652
Yeah.

40:51.749 --> 40:54.923
No, no, I don't want you
to miss this opportunity.

40:55.019 --> 40:57.021
Great. Yeah, see you then.

40:58.789 --> 41:01.133
Mercury just showed up.
Wants to go for a test drive.

41:01.225 --> 41:02.727
I'm thinking the CRV.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.129
Like it?

41:26.274 --> 41:27.844
Really, I'll get out and push.

41:27.942 --> 41:29.478
No, no, you're the client. I'll push.

41:31.412 --> 41:33.452
Well, you were the one
that said it could handle it.

41:34.215 --> 41:35.694
Yup, I did say that. Yup.

41:37.518 --> 41:38.861
No problem.

41:51.432 --> 41:53.844
Ah.

41:54.802 --> 41:57.646
I hired the best choreographer
in North America for you.

41:57.738 --> 41:59.649
Angel Stojko, an Olympic champion

41:59.740 --> 42:01.500
is willing to come up here
and work with you.

42:01.642 --> 42:03.253
It's exactly what you need
to win the Nationals.

42:03.277 --> 42:05.322
Yeah, but I still have to win
my section first, Daddy.

42:05.346 --> 42:08.327
Come on, the Sectionals is a shoo-in,
we know that.

42:08.416 --> 42:11.090
This is your year to win the Nationals.

42:12.119 --> 42:13.723
Honey, you're up from your nap.

42:13.821 --> 42:14.925
Of course I'm up.

42:15.022 --> 42:16.524
With this racket going on down here,

42:16.624 --> 42:18.101
I thought I was
missing a party or something.

42:18.125 --> 42:19.297
Sorry, honey.

42:21.262 --> 42:22.582
Honey, are you putting on weight?

42:22.763 --> 42:24.242
Uh, no.

42:26.033 --> 42:29.173
No, you're looking a little hippy there.

42:29.370 --> 42:30.490
Rose, maybe you shouldn't...

42:30.538 --> 42:31.744
Hush, Henry.

42:32.473 --> 42:35.147
Her dress is custom-made.
Her measurements can't change.

42:35.576 --> 42:38.557
Heather, bring down
the measuring tape, honey!

42:40.681 --> 42:42.627
<i>And I know that I know</i>

42:42.883 --> 42:44.863
<i>Yet I'm risking it all</i>

42:45.519 --> 42:47.726
<i>And we'll just get a box</i>

42:48.522 --> 42:53.301
<i>I'm ready to fall</i>

42:54.495 --> 42:56.270
<i>'Cause I know you'll pull me up</i>

42:56.831 --> 42:59.573
<i>'Cause I know you'll pull me up</i>

43:18.052 --> 43:19.053
Hey.

43:20.021 --> 43:21.021
Hey.

43:25.626 --> 43:26.696
Uh,

43:26.894 --> 43:28.840
Merc says you're doing
really good with the kids.

43:29.530 --> 43:30.531
Thanks.

43:32.366 --> 43:35.313
He said you're a really
great hockey player.

43:35.536 --> 43:36.571
Used to.

43:36.771 --> 43:39.081
I shoot some pucks every now and then.

43:40.308 --> 43:41.446
Why'd You quit?

43:44.178 --> 43:46.556
Didn't have a... Didn't have a choice.

43:46.647 --> 43:47.887
I'll, uh... I'll see you later.

43:53.054 --> 43:54.624
Arms out for balance.

43:54.722 --> 43:56.963
That's a lot better, good job.

44:35.196 --> 44:36.937
I'm not gonna quit.

44:39.834 --> 44:42.872
We're gonna need a second opinion
on your knee.

44:44.271 --> 44:47.081
What do you think about
going to Nationals?

44:47.241 --> 44:49.983
I didn't even qualify for Sectionals.

44:50.077 --> 44:52.250
I'll get you into Sectionals.

45:05.192 --> 45:06.603
Is your mother there?

45:06.694 --> 45:08.537
Look, Louis, you're calling
on the home phone

45:08.629 --> 45:10.370
and I'm trying to do my homework.

45:10.464 --> 45:14.276
<i>Well, yes, sorry,
it's just she isn't answering her cell.</i>

45:14.769 --> 45:16.976
- She's at work.
- No, she isn't.

45:17.338 --> 45:19.011
- Yes, she is.
- No, she isn't.

45:19.173 --> 45:21.153
<i>Files, she is.
- No, she isn't.</i>

45:21.242 --> 45:23.017
I made my first sale.

45:24.445 --> 45:26.322
I so want your job.

45:26.981 --> 45:28.153
Whoo!

45:28.549 --> 45:31.553
She nailed a sale in 17 days.

45:34.054 --> 45:38.366
- I hate it when he does that.
- Yeah, he is getting better at it though.

45:41.962 --> 45:44.203
Yes! Yes! Yes!

45:47.234 --> 45:49.271
- Any pain?
- A little.

45:50.104 --> 45:53.142
MRI shows a longitudinal tear
in the meniscus.

45:54.041 --> 45:56.715
Can you straighten your leg out for me?

45:58.746 --> 46:00.748
- Not too bad.
- The doctor in Toronto said

46:00.848 --> 46:02.850
I couldn't skate for 12 weeks.

46:02.950 --> 46:05.863
With rest it can get better,
but it is vulnerable to further injury.

46:07.988 --> 46:09.467
We can do PRP.

46:11.292 --> 46:13.431
- What's that?
- Platelet-Rich Plasma.

46:13.928 --> 46:16.841
Blood spinning,
it speeds up the healing process.

46:16.931 --> 46:18.035
Okay.

46:18.132 --> 46:21.636
Look, these treatments are expensive,
does the family have money?

46:21.735 --> 46:22.775
I'll cover the treatments.

46:23.571 --> 46:27.542
- All right, well, then she must be good.
- More than good, she can go all the way.

46:29.743 --> 46:31.882
- We'll work it out.
- Thanks.

46:32.746 --> 46:35.420
I'm a warrior, intensity in the eyes.

46:35.516 --> 46:39.054
I'm attacking, always intense, I want that.

46:39.787 --> 46:41.733
None of this sort of dead-eyed,

46:41.822 --> 46:43.733
"Oh, I don't know where I'm going. Oh."

46:43.824 --> 46:45.826
"Where am I? I'm lost
in a shopping center."

46:45.926 --> 46:47.200
"I can't find the cucumbers."

46:47.728 --> 46:49.969
We don't want that. Look and attack.

46:50.865 --> 46:52.401
It's good, it's good.

46:52.833 --> 46:56.110
- It's not great, but it's good.
- Okay.

46:56.203 --> 46:57.803
You know what you're gonna win
with good?

46:57.838 --> 46:59.784
Nothing, again let's go.

46:59.974 --> 47:01.351
Okay. you ready?

47:06.814 --> 47:11.388
<i>To light a fire and right some wrongs</i>

47:13.654 --> 47:16.464
<i>Change is coming</i>

47:16.557 --> 47:20.027
<i>Ebb and flaw and risk it all</i>

47:22.730 --> 47:25.438
Okay, any pain,
are you feeling any pain here?

47:25.533 --> 47:27.535
- A little, yeah.
- Ls it fatiguing?

47:27.635 --> 47:29.615
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's try one more time.

47:29.703 --> 47:31.011
All right.

47:36.810 --> 47:38.983
What I wanna do now is Brackets.

47:39.613 --> 47:41.991
You need to get it nice and soft.

47:42.349 --> 47:45.387
Okay, I want to test that power
and test that balance.

47:45.486 --> 47:47.022
Okay, let's try again.

47:47.288 --> 47:49.700
Let's see how the knee feels.

47:49.790 --> 47:51.929
That's it, that's it, that's it.

47:52.026 --> 47:53.630
Okay, come back on the other leg.

47:53.894 --> 47:56.773
- How'd that feel on the knee?
- It felt weak.

47:59.633 --> 48:03.581
All right, throw it back to me.
Okay, stay focused, core, okay.

48:03.671 --> 48:05.275
Stronger, throw it stronger.

48:05.439 --> 48:07.885
Good, good.
Watch the core, watch the balance.

48:09.643 --> 48:11.316
This'll hurt at some point.

48:11.579 --> 48:13.024
Tell me when.

48:13.581 --> 48:15.219
- Now, yeah.
- Okay.

48:17.084 --> 48:19.621
Hey Darce, I want you to do me a favor.

48:20.254 --> 48:21.995
Help out Mattie with some rehab.

48:22.089 --> 48:23.089
Yeah, sure.

48:25.259 --> 48:29.036
Come on, Mattie. Come on, let's go.
You got it, come on. Keep going.

48:29.363 --> 48:30.967
Faster. Let's go.

48:41.542 --> 48:42.816
Come on.

48:44.244 --> 48:45.382
Let's go, Mattie. Come on.

48:48.248 --> 48:49.793
Do you even know
where we're going?

48:49.817 --> 48:52.161
- You can do it, come on.
- Wait up.

48:53.921 --> 48:55.798
Keep going! Keep going!

48:56.457 --> 48:59.233
Almost there!

49:02.062 --> 49:03.405
Any pain?

49:03.530 --> 49:05.032
No, no pain.

49:05.132 --> 49:07.305
Give me a little bit more.

49:07.401 --> 49:08.880
- Any pain?
- No.

49:09.637 --> 49:11.844
Okay, that's good, you can rest it.

49:11.939 --> 49:13.782
You gotta let her compete in Sectionals.

49:13.874 --> 49:15.118
<i>She didn't qualify.</i>

49:15.142 --> 49:17.383
Look, Maurice, you owe me a favor.

49:17.478 --> 49:19.116
I'm calling it in.

50:09.596 --> 50:11.837
Pull your arms back a bit. Good.

50:11.932 --> 50:13.104
Okay, resist.

50:14.101 --> 50:15.341
Let's go backwards again.

50:15.436 --> 50:17.882
Just wanna test the knee a little bit
with some power.

50:17.971 --> 50:21.509
Okay, easy at first, just easy.
Yeah, nice in the knees.

50:21.975 --> 50:24.717
Nice soft knees, nice and light at first.

50:25.145 --> 50:26.783
- How's the balance feel?
- Okay.

50:26.880 --> 50:29.292
Good, trust the edges, trust them.

50:29.883 --> 50:31.760
A little more power in the knee.

50:35.923 --> 50:37.129
Excellent, okay good.

50:38.692 --> 50:40.000
All right.

50:41.295 --> 50:42.433
Inside hop.

50:44.665 --> 50:45.735
Good.

50:46.233 --> 50:47.769
Can you do a landing position for me?

50:47.868 --> 50:49.711
Just hold the landing. Yup, that's it.

50:50.370 --> 50:52.850
Strengthen the knee, it looks good,
it looks really good.

50:52.940 --> 50:55.147
Stay there. Stay there, kiddo.

50:55.809 --> 50:58.119
Good, straighten the knee.

50:58.746 --> 51:00.748
Draw the energy through, bend that knee.

51:00.848 --> 51:04.125
It looks really good, stay
there, stay there, stay there.

51:04.885 --> 51:05.955
Good.

51:07.221 --> 51:09.326
- How's the knee feel?
- Good.

51:09.423 --> 51:11.801
- You wanna take it for a test drive?
- Yeah.

51:19.266 --> 51:21.109
I thought you told me
she didn't skate anymore.

51:21.368 --> 51:23.279
Well, yeah, that's what she said.

51:23.670 --> 51:25.672
Wasn't I right to tell
you not to trust her?

51:28.675 --> 51:30.595
You might want to ask her
why she's lying to you.

51:31.745 --> 51:32.883
Good.

51:37.217 --> 51:39.493
Heather, Heather, give me that.

51:52.099 --> 51:54.375
That's good, that's good
that little insert there.

51:58.839 --> 52:02.150
Stop, stop, stop.

52:02.242 --> 52:03.983
Where are your arms, Heather?

52:04.077 --> 52:07.183
Up, up, ball of light in your chest.

52:07.447 --> 52:09.427
Beautiful swan not sick little duck.

52:09.516 --> 52:11.086
Use your arms, it's not Riverdance.

52:15.756 --> 52:17.861
Why do you live at the rink?

52:19.126 --> 52:21.037
Well, my dad's a drunk,

52:22.129 --> 52:24.075
he's in and out of jail.

52:24.631 --> 52:27.134
- What about your mom?
- She took off.

52:28.268 --> 52:31.078
I guess she just couldn't
stand him anymore.

52:31.171 --> 52:32.616
That's rough.

52:32.840 --> 52:34.148
It's okay.

52:34.775 --> 52:38.746
I was practicing at the rink a lot,
Mercury kind of took me in.

52:39.213 --> 52:42.387
Gave me a job,
let me sleep in the dressing rooms.

52:45.886 --> 52:47.194
It's okay.

52:58.532 --> 53:02.947
Heather said you got in a fight
with someone and hurt him pretty bad.

53:06.940 --> 53:09.614
Yeah, it was a hockey fight.

53:11.979 --> 53:14.459
Is that why you can't play anymore?

53:14.915 --> 53:16.258
I can play.

53:17.818 --> 53:19.320
The guy I hurt,

53:20.053 --> 53:21.293
he was a friend

53:22.990 --> 53:24.992
and he can't play anymore,

53:25.359 --> 53:26.429
SO...

53:29.730 --> 53:32.472
I figured I don't deserve to.

53:36.370 --> 53:37.678
I'm sorry.

53:49.049 --> 53:50.560
I think we're gonna need
to get your hair highlighted

53:50.584 --> 53:52.495
before Sectionals, too.

53:53.520 --> 53:56.524
And I was thinking
maybe a little Botox wouldn't hurt.

53:56.623 --> 53:57.693
For who?

53:57.858 --> 53:59.302
You don't want to be frowning
while you skate.

53:59.326 --> 54:02.136
The judges like a nice calm, smooth face.

54:02.229 --> 54:04.402
You don't know what the judges like.

54:04.498 --> 54:06.000
Good taste is universal, dear.

54:06.166 --> 54:09.511
Besides, I'm just looking out
for your best interest.

54:10.470 --> 54:11.710
Didn't I warn you about Mattie?

54:20.447 --> 54:22.859
- Hey, Heather.
- Why did you lie to me?

54:22.950 --> 54:24.224
Was it all a con?

54:24.484 --> 54:27.658
To see what I was planning,
see what I was wearing, hear my music?

54:27.754 --> 54:28.858
I never lied to you.

54:28.956 --> 54:31.937
You said you weren't skating anymore
but you are.

54:32.960 --> 54:35.566
I even shared my secret
potato chip stash with you.

54:44.204 --> 54:45.342
Hello.

54:45.505 --> 54:48.213
It's Mercury, I'm really liking the CRV.

54:48.508 --> 54:50.749
Really, that's excellent news.

54:50.844 --> 54:52.221
<i>Listen, if you're not too busy tonight</i>

54:52.245 --> 54:55.249
<i>I thought maybe you'd like
to grab a bite to eat?</i>

54:55.349 --> 54:57.329
You mean, like, a date?

54:57.417 --> 54:58.417
A date, date?

54:58.618 --> 55:00.256
Yeah, I guess, if you're not busy.

55:01.121 --> 55:02.623
Well, actually, I am busy.

55:02.723 --> 55:03.723
Oh.

55:04.324 --> 55:05.735
I'm having dinner with you.

55:10.097 --> 55:13.806
Okay, so you take the outside edges
and fold them in the middle

55:14.134 --> 55:15.704
to hide the edges

55:16.136 --> 55:18.412
and then you break it in

55:19.172 --> 55:21.584
three like this.

55:22.009 --> 55:24.080
Okay, we'll try that again.

55:25.479 --> 55:27.186
I never saw my mom do it like this.

55:27.280 --> 55:29.692
Well, now you know, sort of.

55:31.385 --> 55:34.662
- Aunt Ginger, can I ask you something?
- Mmm-hmm.

55:34.755 --> 55:37.929
Well, I don't know if I can answer
but, fire away.

55:38.592 --> 55:41.505
If you don't tell someone, like,

55:41.595 --> 55:43.597
exactly what you're doing,

55:44.798 --> 55:46.277
it's not lying, is it?

55:47.267 --> 55:50.146
Not that you're doing anything wrong but...

55:52.005 --> 55:56.385
Well, that might depend on who
you're not telling and what you're doing.

55:57.377 --> 55:59.789
In my books, lie to no one.

56:00.047 --> 56:03.085
I mean, if you love them,
be honest with them.

56:03.283 --> 56:04.762
They deserve it and so do you.

56:04.918 --> 56:09.298
And if you don't love them, then why go
to the trouble of lying, right?

56:09.389 --> 56:11.562
Okay, here, try a bigger one.

56:11.792 --> 56:13.533
Try the biggest one.

56:14.861 --> 56:16.431
All right, outside...

56:44.024 --> 56:46.095
Mattie, you can talk to me.

56:46.726 --> 56:48.728
Honey, what's the matter?

56:50.330 --> 56:52.936
I lost my only friend I had at school.

56:55.435 --> 56:56.914
What happened?

56:58.538 --> 57:01.849
I lied to her, I didn't mean to but...

57:03.376 --> 57:04.376
I did.

57:07.714 --> 57:09.591
And I lied to you, too.

57:17.023 --> 57:18.934
I think it's great that
you gave Mattie a job

57:19.192 --> 57:21.604
and that you got her
such a fantastic sports doctor

57:21.695 --> 57:24.437
and on top of that, apparently
you're coaching her for free.

57:24.531 --> 57:25.976
What, did you think she's an orphan?

57:26.900 --> 57:28.675
Or are you just trying to play hero.

57:28.768 --> 57:31.510
Well, guess what, I don't
believe in heroes.

57:31.605 --> 57:33.107
She told me she told you.

57:33.206 --> 57:35.846
She told me she was coaching little kids.

57:35.942 --> 57:38.718
Do you even have kids? You don't, do you.

57:38.879 --> 57:41.018
It was your responsibility
to make sure I knew.

57:41.148 --> 57:42.718
Parental consent, ever hear of it?

57:42.816 --> 57:44.921
- I'm sorry.
- And you shouldn't be filling her head

57:45.018 --> 57:46.691
full of dreams that can't happen.

57:47.888 --> 57:50.008
That's what you think,
that this can't happen for her?

57:50.690 --> 57:52.135
Not on my salary.

57:52.225 --> 57:53.499
I'll cover the cost.

57:53.593 --> 57:57.040
- No, I have taken enough handouts.
- This is not a handout.

57:57.130 --> 57:59.337
Really, what is it then?

57:59.533 --> 58:01.672
I want a champion and I think Mattie's it.

58:08.008 --> 58:09.043
What about her knee?

58:09.142 --> 58:11.816
She's doing rehab, it's strong
and getting stronger.

58:13.046 --> 58:14.624
Look, Kelly, you've gotta let her skate.

58:14.648 --> 58:17.925
You were a skater,
you know exactly what this means.

58:24.124 --> 58:25.330
Look...

58:25.825 --> 58:28.669
- I don't have a lot going on in my life.
- That's obvious.

58:28.762 --> 58:30.241
Not since my wife died.

58:31.965 --> 58:33.239
I'm sorry.

58:37.070 --> 58:40.950
Mattie needs this, maybe I need this
just as much and maybe so do you.

58:41.041 --> 58:42.918
Maybe together, we have a shot.

58:46.846 --> 58:48.985
Okay, Mattie, let's do the whole program.

58:49.082 --> 58:50.152
Okay.

58:53.420 --> 58:56.833
Turns out Angel is available
so we're taking the ice after all.

58:56.923 --> 58:58.869
You canceled, Mattie has the ice.

58:58.959 --> 59:01.269
We paid for it so we're un-canceling.

59:01.661 --> 59:04.540
Heather, go get your skates on, sweetie.
Can you help her?

59:04.631 --> 59:07.111
It's okay, you stay with me, honey.

59:08.068 --> 59:11.174
Kelly, I heard you were back in town.
We've missed you.

59:11.304 --> 59:13.511
I had no idea you were Heather's mother.

59:13.607 --> 59:16.019
Well, insight never was your strong suit.

59:16.776 --> 59:21.350
Heard the modeling thing didn't work out,
and you ended up hawking used cars.

59:21.548 --> 59:23.050
And Mickey left you?

59:23.450 --> 59:26.590
Not true, but this isn't
about you and I, is it?

59:26.686 --> 59:30.224
No, this is about my daughter,
and I'm not gonna let you mess with her.

59:30.890 --> 59:34.064
Look, you take half the ice,
we'll take the other half.

59:34.861 --> 59:36.772
You want us to share the ice
after we've paid for it,

59:36.796 --> 59:37.873
is that what you're saying?

59:37.897 --> 59:40.309
There's plenty of ice,
it's that way or the highway.

59:45.205 --> 59:47.845
Well, look who's been
making friends here already.

59:52.078 --> 59:53.250
That was very tense.

59:54.648 --> 59:56.423
I love drama.

01:00:01.454 --> 01:00:04.367
- Mickey, Wild Mickey P.
- Yeah.

01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:09.297
Rose and I were 19, both skaters
and she fell hard for him.

01:00:10.163 --> 01:00:12.370
Let me guess, he fell for you.

01:00:14.467 --> 01:00:16.822
So, Mattie is the
daughter of two skaters.

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:17.847
Yup.

01:00:37.624 --> 01:00:39.695
You know, you don't have to do this.

01:00:39.793 --> 01:00:41.534
Are you gonna kick her off?

01:00:41.628 --> 01:00:42.629
No.

01:00:43.163 --> 01:00:46.201
- Then I have to do it.
- Don't compete with her.

01:00:49.536 --> 01:00:52.608
<i>Another preview</i>

01:00:57.644 --> 01:01:01.490
<i>Empty faces, empty mind</i>

01:01:01.981 --> 01:01:06.088
<i>Thoughts are hidden behind the blinds</i>

01:01:06.453 --> 01:01:10.731
<i>I can feel my head turn white</i>

01:01:15.628 --> 01:01:19.075
<i>They're telling me</i>

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.910
<i>It's all a dream</i>

01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:28.385
<i>And I can't see through</i>

01:01:33.179 --> 01:01:35.921
<i>It doesn't mean</i>

01:01:37.484 --> 01:01:40.192
<i>The end of me</i>

01:01:41.921 --> 01:01:45.494
<i>And I will come through</i>

01:01:48.228 --> 01:01:49.229
Oh.

01:01:49.329 --> 01:01:50.467
Oh, my.

01:01:52.866 --> 01:01:54.106
Terrible.

01:01:54.434 --> 01:01:58.746
<i>Thoughts had gone, if only time</i>

01:01:58.838 --> 01:02:03.150
<i>Nothing in my head to find</i>

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:04.710
Hmm.

01:02:07.313 --> 01:02:10.658
<i>So lock my heart</i>

01:02:11.618 --> 01:02:14.792
<i>Behind your gaze</i>

01:02:16.156 --> 01:02:18.158
<i>Hold up</i>

01:02:20.593 --> 01:02:23.233
<i>And we can say</i>

01:02:24.998 --> 01:02:27.808
<i>To listen</i>

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:32.507
<i>To hear me out</i>

01:02:33.506 --> 01:02:36.510
<i>To hear me out</i>

01:02:37.977 --> 01:02:40.082
<i>Deep down in me</i>

01:02:49.522 --> 01:02:51.468
The claws are out.

01:02:59.699 --> 01:03:00.769
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:00.867 --> 01:03:02.073
What's this?

01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:12.956
Personal space, people.

01:03:22.121 --> 01:03:23.259
- Heather!
- Enough!

01:03:23.957 --> 01:03:25.129
Get off the ice now!

01:03:36.436 --> 01:03:39.349
You can't blame Mercury
for being mad at you.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:44.149
I mean, what if you hurt yourself
doing something so stupid?

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:47.118
And all the hard work that you've done,

01:03:47.313 --> 01:03:50.760
all the hard work he's done
to get you into Sectionals.

01:03:51.818 --> 01:03:53.297
He got me in?

01:03:53.653 --> 01:03:54.825
Yeah, he said he would.

01:03:55.021 --> 01:03:56.193
Wow.

01:04:04.397 --> 01:04:06.877
Heather you can't let her beat you.

01:04:08.535 --> 01:04:11.015
You're better than she is, you are.

01:04:11.838 --> 01:04:14.478
Now, promise me that you're gonna win.

01:04:17.143 --> 01:04:21.023
Heather, are you listening to me,
promise me that you're gonna beat her.

01:04:21.114 --> 01:04:22.752
Yeah, and how can I promise you that?

01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:26.296
Well, it's called
the law of intention, Heather.

01:04:26.386 --> 01:04:28.889
You just make the intention,
it has to be crystal clear,

01:04:28.988 --> 01:04:32.492
your intention needs to be,
"I'm gonna beat this girl."

01:04:33.059 --> 01:04:34.800
And, well obviously anybody else.

01:04:34.894 --> 01:04:38.865
Wait, shouldn't her intention just be
to be the best she can be?

01:04:41.134 --> 01:04:44.115
That's not a very
worthwhile intention, Henry.

01:04:44.203 --> 01:04:46.240
Sometimes you're so thick.

01:04:47.206 --> 01:04:48.344
No...

01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:51.186
Promise me that you're gonna beat her.

01:04:51.277 --> 01:04:52.483
Yes, Mom.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.852
"Yes, Mom" what?

01:04:55.281 --> 01:04:57.022
I promise I'll win.

01:05:01.387 --> 01:05:04.061
Honey, I think you've had enough, yeah?

01:05:17.503 --> 01:05:20.074
Mattie's gonna need an amazing costume.

01:05:20.173 --> 01:05:22.619
We'll be her official
sponsor, I'll call Ross.

01:05:22.709 --> 01:05:24.120
- Ross?
- He's my BFF.

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:25.689
Works for the Ice Capades.

01:05:25.778 --> 01:05:28.524
He'll whip up a costume in like a week
and guarantee it'll be stunning.

01:05:28.548 --> 01:05:30.687
Oh, my gosh, this is exciting.

01:05:31.384 --> 01:05:33.091
Palladino's first skater.

01:05:36.255 --> 01:05:38.235
Are you all right, honey?

01:05:39.926 --> 01:05:42.167
- Are you eating something?
- No.

01:05:43.062 --> 01:05:45.599
- Yes, you are. What are you eating?
- Nothing.

01:05:45.698 --> 01:05:47.609
- Give it to me.
- No, no.

01:05:50.370 --> 01:05:52.714
Potato chips, really?

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:56.441
Empty calories, full of
fat, full of grease,

01:05:56.466 --> 01:05:58.510
bad for your skin,
bad for your figure.

01:05:59.045 --> 01:06:00.456
Are you sabotaging yourself?

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.591
No, you're sabotaging me.

01:06:02.815 --> 01:06:04.726
Did I raise a loser?

01:06:06.786 --> 01:06:08.060
No, I don't think so.

01:06:09.188 --> 01:06:10.462
Heather,

01:06:10.857 --> 01:06:13.269
I'm only thinking about you here, okay?

01:06:13.426 --> 01:06:15.235
You need to do whatever it is
you need to do

01:06:15.328 --> 01:06:17.740
to win the competition, right? Okay?

01:06:18.264 --> 01:06:19.868
Failure's not an option.

01:06:19.966 --> 01:06:21.326
Potato chips are not part of that.

01:06:45.124 --> 01:06:46.728
Are you crying?

01:06:47.627 --> 01:06:51.074
No, I just got a little piece
of potato chip in my eye.

01:08:14.046 --> 01:08:15.787
- Heather took them.
- Hey.

01:08:15.915 --> 01:08:18.292
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

01:08:18.384 --> 01:08:21.490
Look, what matters is getting you
another pair of skates.

01:08:22.321 --> 01:08:25.734
Even if Mercury finds some skates that fit,

01:08:27.126 --> 01:08:29.197
you know you won't have time
to get used to them.

01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:32.571
And with the knee...

01:08:34.533 --> 01:08:37.310
Maybe it's best we just sit this one out.

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:41.645
Come on, you're young there's plenty
of competitions ahead for you.

01:08:41.741 --> 01:08:43.448
I'm competing, Mom.

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:46.046
One way or another.

01:08:46.145 --> 01:08:47.647
I am competing.

01:08:48.214 --> 01:08:50.921
Look what I found in the garage.

01:08:52.652 --> 01:08:54.928
Clearly, I keep everything.

01:08:55.453 --> 01:08:57.161
All right, what size are you?

01:08:57.256 --> 01:08:58.599
I think a eight and a half.

01:08:58.691 --> 01:09:02.798
Eight and a half, let's see what
we can find in here.

01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:05.368
- Oh, my God.
- My goodness.

01:09:06.165 --> 01:09:10.705
Here are your skates.
These were custom made for your mother.

01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:15.078
They need a little sharpening
but come on, let's try them on.

01:09:15.575 --> 01:09:17.953
- Wouldn't it be great?
- These might be magic.

01:09:18.077 --> 01:09:19.317
Oh.

01:09:22.481 --> 01:09:24.017
It's gonna work.

01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:25.627
You know, I can loosen them
a little bit more.

01:09:25.651 --> 01:09:28.221
- Do you want me to put the laces on it.
- It's too tight.

01:09:28.321 --> 01:09:31.200
- Well, let's just loosen...
- They won't fit!

01:09:32.158 --> 01:09:35.332
Forget it. I'm sorry
lever started skating again.

01:09:41.701 --> 01:09:44.272
- I can't believe...
- Sorry about that.

01:09:50.343 --> 01:09:53.187
Heather the fabric doesn't
lie, it's too tight.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.815
You had them make it too tight.

01:09:54.914 --> 01:09:57.417
Don't be ridiculous,
we're gonna have to let this out.

01:09:57.550 --> 01:10:00.190
Do you know what, I'm not competing.

01:10:01.287 --> 01:10:02.287
Do not...

01:10:02.688 --> 01:10:05.931
Do not pull this on me now, okay.
Not after everything I've put out for you.

01:10:06.025 --> 01:10:07.333
What you've put out?

01:10:07.627 --> 01:10:09.231
What about what I've put out.

01:10:09.328 --> 01:10:10.932
The abuse I take from you.

01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:14.068
It's not abuse, Heather. It's guidance.

01:10:14.166 --> 01:10:16.646
I am trying to help you
become a better person.

01:10:16.736 --> 01:10:19.876
- You just want me to win.
- Well, of course, I want you to win.

01:10:19.972 --> 01:10:21.349
I'm not competing.

01:10:22.975 --> 01:10:25.319
I'm not. It's my decision.

01:10:26.312 --> 01:10:29.816
No, it isn't. Not after everything
I've sacrificed for you.

01:10:29.916 --> 01:10:34.331
The number of days I have spent
in that cold arena drinking bad coffee.

01:10:35.454 --> 01:10:36.654
You'll compete and you'll win.

01:10:37.089 --> 01:10:40.502
Do you understand me?
You will compete and you'll win.

01:10:41.127 --> 01:10:43.334
And this conversation's over.

01:10:43.663 --> 01:10:46.337
<i>And the love will drown the pain</i>

01:10:46.432 --> 01:10:48.639
<i>Right in the world</i>

01:10:50.736 --> 01:10:53.512
<i>In my dreams</i>

01:10:59.178 --> 01:11:04.924
<i>And the promises will carry us through</i>

01:11:08.154 --> 01:11:11.431
<i>In my dreams</i>

01:11:15.661 --> 01:11:19.404
<i>And the love will drown the pain</i>

01:11:19.532 --> 01:11:22.843
<i>Right in the world</i>

01:11:27.239 --> 01:11:28.240
Hello.

01:11:28.674 --> 01:11:30.620
Wow. Really? Wow.

01:11:31.644 --> 01:11:32.884
You're kidding.

01:11:32.979 --> 01:11:34.458
I'll tell her.

01:11:35.114 --> 01:11:37.492
Honey, you're not going to believe this.

01:11:37.583 --> 01:11:39.085
Your skates are back.

01:11:39.185 --> 01:11:40.755
- Really?
- Yes.

01:11:43.322 --> 01:11:44.460
Honey.

01:12:15.221 --> 01:12:16.222
- Wow.
- Wow.

01:12:16.322 --> 01:12:17.665
Look at it!

01:12:18.357 --> 01:12:19.836
Oh.

01:12:21.394 --> 01:12:22.873
Very sassy.

01:12:24.764 --> 01:12:25.902
Oh.

01:12:26.866 --> 01:12:28.709
Thank you, Palladino's.

01:12:28.801 --> 01:12:31.008
Oh... Put it on, come on,
I want a fashion show.

01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:39.116
You okay?

01:12:39.845 --> 01:12:40.915
Yeah.

01:12:42.715 --> 01:12:44.626
Maybe a little nervous.

01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:46.991
Mattie,

01:12:47.887 --> 01:12:49.764
no matter what happens,

01:12:50.356 --> 01:12:53.303
I want you to know
how very proud I am of you.

01:12:55.895 --> 01:12:57.101
Honey...

01:12:59.465 --> 01:13:02.309
And I want you to do
one thing for me tomorrow.

01:13:03.502 --> 01:13:04.879
What's that?

01:13:06.839 --> 01:13:09.319
Go out there and have
the time of your life.

01:13:11.343 --> 01:13:12.879
You're doing what you love,

01:13:13.813 --> 01:13:16.020
so go and skate your heart out.

01:13:22.021 --> 01:13:24.160
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.

01:13:55.387 --> 01:13:56.798
<i>La dies and gentlemen,</i>

01:13:56.822 --> 01:14:00.201
<i>I'm sure you all agree
that was super terrific.</i>

01:14:00.493 --> 01:14:02.234
<i>Wasn't that wonderful.</i>

01:14:10.803 --> 01:14:12.305
- We love you.
- Yeah.

01:14:12.404 --> 01:14:13.439
We love you, Mattie!

01:14:15.808 --> 01:14:17.617
- Hey, kid, how you feeling?
- Good.

01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:20.054
Someone wants to meet you.

01:14:20.146 --> 01:14:21.591
- Tessa Virtue.
- Hi.

01:14:21.714 --> 01:14:23.458
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:14:23.482 --> 01:14:25.082
I saw you win your gold medal.

01:14:25.718 --> 01:14:28.130
- How's the knee feeling?
- A lot better, thanks.

01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:30.757
Good. You've earned this.
You're gonna be great.

01:14:30.856 --> 01:14:32.164
Thank you.

01:14:32.258 --> 01:14:34.204
Well, I just wanted to wish you luck,
have fun.

01:14:34.293 --> 01:14:36.102
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:14:36.929 --> 01:14:38.840
- That was nice. You all set?
- Yeah.

01:14:57.049 --> 01:15:02.294
<i>And up next, folks, from Parry Sound,
Ontario, Suzy Kado.</i>

01:15:02.588 --> 01:15:05.501
<i>Here competing for the
Regional Championship title.</i>

01:15:18.804 --> 01:15:21.944
Holy moly, these kids are good.
Can Mattie top this?

01:15:22.041 --> 01:15:23.418
We'll see.

01:15:36.322 --> 01:15:39.667
<i>And up next folks,
from Parry Sound, Ontario...</i>

01:15:45.664 --> 01:15:49.202
<i>And mark for Lori is 89.97.</i>

01:15:50.803 --> 01:15:53.682
<i>Lori will be disappointed with that score.</i>

01:15:55.274 --> 01:16:00.451
<i>148.23 is the combined score,
for Ruth Webster.</i>

01:16:01.814 --> 01:16:04.852
<i>And up next, folks, is Mattie Dane.</i>

01:16:06.218 --> 01:16:07.424
Go, Mattie!

01:16:20.132 --> 01:16:22.271
<i>Mattie Dane is just back an the ice</i>

01:16:22.368 --> 01:16:24.405
<i>after a recent serious knee injury.</i>

01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:28.909
<i>Now, that's what we all call
a true competitor.</i>

01:16:40.753 --> 01:16:42.391
Oh, my God, I can't look.

01:16:48.594 --> 01:16:50.369
Go ahead and breathe.

01:17:02.141 --> 01:17:04.382
<i>Who am Ito give advice</i>

01:17:04.677 --> 01:17:07.157
<i>I'm nobody but take a listen</i>

01:17:08.047 --> 01:17:13.258
<i>Just like everybody else I've got a story</i>

01:17:13.619 --> 01:17:15.599
<i>I don't know how to say it nice</i>

01:17:15.821 --> 01:17:18.097
<i>I shine it up and make it glisten</i>

01:17:19.158 --> 01:17:23.971
<i>All I know is I belie
ve and it's reassuring</i>

01:17:24.396 --> 01:17:27.343
<i>When I was out, when I was down</i>

01:17:27.566 --> 01:17:29.910
<i>Somebody told me something</i>

01:17:30.002 --> 01:17:33.108
<i>So simple but I follow it to this day</i>

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.414
<i>Hey, go follow your rainbow</i>

01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:40.786
<i>Follow the rainbow</i>

01:17:40.879 --> 01:17:44.326
<i>Hey don't believe when they say no</i>

01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:46.291
<i>You say no</i>

01:17:46.518 --> 01:17:49.829
<i>Hey, go follow your rainbow</i>

01:17:49.922 --> 01:17:52.630
Dan 't you believe, don 't you believe 'em

01:17:52.725 --> 01:17:55.569
<i>Hey, don't believe when they say no</i>

01:17:55.661 --> 01:17:57.334
<i>Say, "Yeah "</i>

01:17:57.529 --> 01:18:00.339
<i>I know what you might be thinking</i>

01:18:01.767 --> 01:18:03.440
<i>That'll never work for me</i>

01:18:03.569 --> 01:18:05.810
<i>Too young, too old, too poor</i>

01:18:05.904 --> 01:18:09.044
<i>They're just excuses</i>

01:18:09.808 --> 01:18:11.788
Come on, come on, come on.

01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:16.857
Okay, stay on the edge.

01:18:17.049 --> 01:18:18.790
Do it, baby. You can do it, baby.

01:18:19.385 --> 01:18:21.922
<i>Hey, go follow your rainbow</i>

01:18:23.122 --> 01:18:24.760
<i>Go follow your rainbow</i>

<i>Hey, go follow your rainbow</i>

01:18:34.199 --> 01:18:36.509
<i>And you'll find your pot of gold</i>

01:18:36.602 --> 01:18:39.640
<i>Hey, don't believe
when they say no, say no</i>

01:18:42.274 --> 01:18:45.949
<i>Look deep inside your heart</i>

01:18:46.111 --> 01:18:49.923
<i>Well, what do you see,
when you're finally free</i>

01:18:50.015 --> 01:18:53.792
<i>If you only take a chance</i>

01:18:56.555 --> 01:18:58.432
<i>Now who am Ito give advice</i>

01:18:58.957 --> 01:19:01.494
<i>I'm nobody but you better listen</i>

01:19:02.594 --> 01:19:04.096
That's my girl! Come on!

01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:07.005
<i>'Cause I'm the little voice
inside your head saying</i>

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:10.437
<i>Hey, go follow your rainbow</i>

01:19:10.536 --> 01:19:13.142
<i>Go follow, go follow your rainbow</i>

01:19:14.406 --> 01:19:16.181
<i>Hey, don't believe when they say no</i>

01:19:16.275 --> 01:19:19.119
<i>When they say no, don't you believe it</i>

01:19:19.278 --> 01:19:21.884
<i>Hey, go follow your rainbow</i>

01:19:22.014 --> 01:19:24.585
<i>And you will find your pot of gold</i>

01:19:24.783 --> 01:19:28.458
Dan 't you believe, don 't you believe it

01:19:30.322 --> 01:19:31.630
<i>Who am Ito give advice</i>

01:19:31.924 --> 01:19:35.133
<i>I'm nobody but you better listen</i>

01:19:35.227 --> 01:19:37.434
- Yeah, Mattie!
- Go, Mattie!

01:19:37.596 --> 01:19:39.633
I knew you could do it.

01:19:58.417 --> 01:20:00.397
- We love you!
- Mattie.

01:20:01.353 --> 01:20:02.525
Mattie!

01:20:12.764 --> 01:20:14.710
- You were amazing.
- Thank you.

01:20:18.003 --> 01:20:19.003
Thank you.

01:20:23.008 --> 01:20:28.481
<i>The score for
Mattie Dana's long program is 102.30,</i>

01:20:29.014 --> 01:20:32.325
<i>giving her a total score of 158...</i>

01:20:32.417 --> 01:20:33.521
What place?

01:20:35.521 --> 01:20:37.262
- You're in first.
- First.

01:20:37.356 --> 01:20:39.131
You're in first!

01:20:42.327 --> 01:20:44.398
<i>The next skater from Lively, Ontario.</i>

01:20:44.496 --> 01:20:48.034
<i>Representing the Sudbury Skating Club
is Heather Lear.</i>

01:21:02.047 --> 01:21:04.118
- She looks gorgeous.
- Quiet.

01:21:36.148 --> 01:21:37.148
Heather?

01:21:37.215 --> 01:21:39.821
<i>Folks there seems to be some problem.</i>

01:21:41.653 --> 01:21:44.099
Let her go, kiddo. This is yours.

01:21:44.890 --> 01:21:46.130
She's my friend.

01:21:56.034 --> 01:21:57.104
Wow.

01:22:10.282 --> 01:22:13.058
Heather, what are you doing?

01:22:14.486 --> 01:22:17.558
I'm the one, I took your skates.

01:22:19.891 --> 01:22:21.370
I'm sorry.

01:22:21.793 --> 01:22:23.101
I'm sorry.

01:22:24.396 --> 01:22:25.841
I'm so sorry.

01:22:26.164 --> 01:22:28.144
But you brought them back.

01:22:28.233 --> 01:22:29.541
I'm sorry.

01:22:34.072 --> 01:22:36.018
You deserve to win, Mattie.

01:22:36.108 --> 01:22:38.179
I don't deserve to skate.

01:22:38.276 --> 01:22:42.349
- Not after what I did.
- You have to get back out there, Heather.

01:22:42.447 --> 01:22:45.485
It's not fair to anybody,
especially yourself.

01:22:49.621 --> 01:22:52.625
Just look at me, I'm a mess.

01:22:56.128 --> 01:22:57.128
No.

01:22:57.929 --> 01:22:59.704
You're the black swan,

01:22:59.798 --> 01:23:02.176
and you look just how
the black swan should look.

01:23:03.201 --> 01:23:04.509
Beautiful.

01:23:06.605 --> 01:23:07.913
Thank you.

01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:14.591
Heather, 30 seconds to get back on the ice
or you're disqualified.

01:23:14.913 --> 01:23:17.484
Come on, 30 seconds to rock and roll.

01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:19.723
- Come on.
- Go.

01:23:21.853 --> 01:23:23.662
Go, Heather, please.

01:23:24.589 --> 01:23:26.034
Do it for me.

01:23:30.962 --> 01:23:32.032
Yeah.

01:23:59.391 --> 01:24:01.632
She's crying, brilliant strategy,

01:24:01.727 --> 01:24:03.104
adding drama to the moment
for the judges.

01:24:03.128 --> 01:24:05.301
Look at the judges,
they can't take their eyes off her.

01:24:05.397 --> 01:24:08.053
I didn't think she had
it in her, good girl.

01:24:08.078 --> 01:24:09.198
Shut up, Rose.

01:24:10.102 --> 01:24:12.582
Seriously, not another word.

01:24:12.671 --> 01:24:14.014
Not a word.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.465
Class move, kid. Class move.

01:25:11.496 --> 01:25:13.908
You would have done the same.

01:25:13.999 --> 01:25:16.275
Nope, not a chance.

01:25:19.604 --> 01:25:21.584
Okay, Heather, let's do this.

01:25:27.512 --> 01:25:28.855
That's great.

01:25:51.570 --> 01:25:53.413
She only did a double.

01:25:53.972 --> 01:25:56.885
It was perfect and so is she.

01:25:58.443 --> 01:26:00.548
Way past time you realized that, Rose.

01:26:00.812 --> 01:26:02.883
Our daughter is perfect
just the way she is.

01:26:02.981 --> 01:26:05.291
It's too bad you can't see that.

01:26:06.284 --> 01:26:07.661
I feel sorry for you.

01:26:30.342 --> 01:26:32.083
She is perfect, isn't she?

01:27:11.616 --> 01:27:12.617
Whoa.

01:27:12.717 --> 01:27:14.754
She's great.

01:27:29.968 --> 01:27:31.072
Thank you.

01:27:37.242 --> 01:27:39.882
- I'm so proud of you, honey.
- Oh, Mom.

01:27:42.113 --> 01:27:43.854
Our winner is

01:27:44.516 --> 01:27:46.257
<i>Mattie Dane.</i>

01:27:49.587 --> 01:27:53.160
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,

01:27:53.258 --> 01:27:56.933

01:27:57.028 --> 01:28:00.874

01:28:19.918 --> 01:28:22.956
<i>The silver medal to Heather Lear.</i>

01:28:31.629 --> 01:28:36.544
<i>And now the winner,
our gold medalist, Mattie Dane.</i>

01:28:41.639 --> 01:28:42.709
Way to go, Mattie.

01:28:53.151 --> 01:28:56.963
<i>Mattie Dane will be representing us
at the Nationals.</i>

01:29:05.130 --> 01:29:06.131
Thank you.

01:29:08.033 --> 01:29:10.104
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:29:29.587 --> 01:29:34.627
<i>When I see the moon against your eyes</i>

01:29:34.726 --> 01:29:37.866
<i>It's all right</i>

01:29:41.566 --> 01:29:43.910
<i>Everything has changed</i>

01:29:44.069 --> 01:29:48.745
<i>And my senses are awakened to you</i>

01:29:50.108 --> 01:29:52.918
<i>Oh, to you</i>

01:29:53.411 --> 01:29:55.891
<i>The journeys we are making</i>

01:29:56.047 --> 01:29:59.256
<i>The time that we are taking</i>

01:29:59.350 --> 01:30:00.693
<i>So much</i>

01:30:02.053 --> 01:30:04.090
<i>To do</i>

01:30:04.923 --> 01:30:07.267
<i>It's all right</i>

01:30:10.628 --> 01:30:13.632
<i>And it's all right</i>

01:30:16.634 --> 01:30:19.638
<i>Well, it's all right</i>

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.984
<i>And it's all right</i>

01:30:27.912 --> 01:30:31.792
<i>Everything is all right</i>

01:30:40.091 --> 01:30:43.095
<i>Everything is all right</i>
