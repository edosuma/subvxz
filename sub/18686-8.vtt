00:04.965 --> 00:06.086
Previously on Beyond...

00:06.087 --> 00:07.467
What have you been hiding?

00:07.468 --> 00:08.718
Anil Vemuri?

00:08.719 --> 00:10.430
We emailed about your
time working with Arthur.

00:10.431 --> 00:11.681
You look just like her.

00:11.682 --> 00:12.802
Just like who?

00:12.803 --> 00:13.893
Your mother... Celeste.

00:13.894 --> 00:15.225
Holden drew these.

00:15.226 --> 00:17.057
This is where your brother was

00:17.058 --> 00:18.228
when he was in his coma.

00:18.229 --> 00:21.020
This guy has been involved
in youth-based charities.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.232
Fort Reed Helping Hands.

00:22.233 --> 00:24.444
- And it's run by Pastor...
- Pastor Ian Brockman.

00:24.445 --> 00:27.607
- How much do you really know about Pastor Ian?
- Stop this!

00:27.608 --> 00:29.909
We need to bring Holden in, now.

00:29.910 --> 00:31.151
I'll need men and resources.

00:31.152 --> 00:32.363
You'll have carte Blanche.

00:47.218 --> 00:49.380
Holden, we gotta go.
Holden? Holden!

01:44.565 --> 01:46.025
Willa.

01:46.026 --> 01:47.066
What happened?

01:47.067 --> 01:49.359
About 5:00 a.m. his vitals
started going haywire,

01:49.360 --> 01:50.480
his blood pressure spiked...

01:51.362 --> 01:52.443
and he woke up.

01:53.444 --> 01:55.196
- He woke up?
- He said Holden woke him up.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.118
Willa.

02:01.242 --> 02:02.243
Where is he?

02:10.090 --> 02:11.091
Arthur?

02:13.174 --> 02:16.016
Willa! Willa! Willa!

02:20.020 --> 02:22.262
I thought I'd lost you forever.

02:22.263 --> 02:24.063
I don't understand.
What happened?

02:24.064 --> 02:26.977
I was lost 'till
Holden woke me up.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.269
He saved me, Willa.

02:29.270 --> 02:31.231
Holden was in there with you?

02:31.232 --> 02:35.154
No. He was here
in the real world.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.777
But he experienced something...

02:37.778 --> 02:40.079
a disruption.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.455
Holden's connection with the Realm is
stronger than I could have realized.

02:46.837 --> 02:49.169
Uh, about the machine...

02:50.090 --> 02:51.131
Holden destroyed it.

02:52.503 --> 02:53.964
Daniel already told me.

02:55.135 --> 02:58.007
Willa. I need
to see Holden.

02:58.008 --> 02:59.220
Where is he?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.514
Keep applying pressure.

03:04.515 --> 03:07.267
You're gonna be okay. A bullet in the
shoulder ain't nobody's idea of fun,

03:07.268 --> 03:10.610
- but it ain't going to kill you.
- No hospitals! They'll find me.

03:10.611 --> 03:12.482
- We can't.
- We're not going to a hospital.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.983
Not after what I saw
you do back there,

03:13.984 --> 03:16.076
after what I saw those
guys try to do to you.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.029
Something happened to me
while I was in the coma.

03:20.030 --> 03:22.452
Whatever you got to tell me can wait
'till after we've fixed you up.

03:22.453 --> 03:23.783
Sound good?

03:23.784 --> 03:25.205
You're gonna be okay.

03:33.133 --> 03:34.504
You want to be a farmer?

03:34.505 --> 03:36.825
- Here's a couple of "achers."
Here's a couple of "achers."

03:38.048 --> 03:40.009
Dekker, the next one I'll hurt.

03:40.010 --> 03:42.762
- Hey, I need bandages...
- A lot of bandages...

03:42.763 --> 03:45.144
Rubbing alcohol, some forceps,

03:45.145 --> 03:46.516
and a suture kit.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.807
A suture kit?

03:47.808 --> 03:51.402
Or a sterile thread and a
surgical needle of some sort.

03:56.617 --> 03:57.778
Fishing accident.

03:58.779 --> 04:00.361
Looks like you needed
a bigger boat.

04:03.914 --> 04:07.457
Um, alcohol and
bandages, aisle 3...

04:07.458 --> 04:09.209
forceps, aisle 5 and...

04:11.632 --> 04:13.924
let me look for that suture kit.

04:20.591 --> 04:22.803
Any luck with that suture kit?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.522
Pop quiz, hotshot.

04:32.523 --> 04:35.605
You've got a bleeding passenger
in that shot-up sedan,

04:35.606 --> 04:37.156
a gun in the small of your back,

04:37.157 --> 04:38.658
and you come in here
asking for items

04:38.659 --> 04:40.740
that could only mean
self-surgery,

04:40.741 --> 04:42.202
and now I've got you
dead to rights.

04:43.073 --> 04:45.955
So, what do you do? Huh?

04:45.956 --> 04:48.708
What do you do?

04:48.709 --> 04:51.712
Are you seriously quoting
the movie Speed right now?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.796
Jeff!

05:03.093 --> 05:04.924
It's not what you think it is.

05:04.925 --> 05:06.305
What do you think I think it is?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.848
That me and my friend
are some kind of criminals.

05:08.849 --> 05:09.889
Don't tell me.

05:09.890 --> 05:12.191
You're good people
caught in a bad situation?

05:12.192 --> 05:14.233
Actually, yeah.
That's exactly what this is.

05:14.234 --> 05:16.356
So you're Mickey Rourke
in Desperate Hours,

05:16.357 --> 05:18.027
running from the law.

05:18.028 --> 05:20.780
Or maybe you need money
for your friend's sex surgery,

05:20.781 --> 05:22.862
like Al Pacino in
Dog Day Afternoon.

05:22.863 --> 05:24.323
What?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.656
Look, lady, my friend has
a bullet in his shoulder.

05:26.657 --> 05:28.037
Then take him to the hospital.

05:28.038 --> 05:29.038
I can't!

05:29.039 --> 05:32.712
There are people chasing us.
They're... bad guys.

05:32.713 --> 05:35.124
Three Days of the Condor,
Parallax View,

05:35.125 --> 05:36.456
Enemy of the State?
Which is it?

05:36.457 --> 05:39.048
Look, I don't even know half
of those movies, all right?

05:39.049 --> 05:41.130
My name is Jeff McArdle.

05:41.131 --> 05:43.052
I served two tours
in the US Army.

05:43.053 --> 05:45.925
The guy in the car
is Holden Matthews.

05:45.926 --> 05:48.808
He has a family in Fort Reed,
that cares about him...

05:48.809 --> 05:51.852
and... he didn't ask
for any of this.

05:55.145 --> 05:56.185
Please.

05:56.186 --> 05:57.818
Hands up!

05:59.069 --> 06:01.150
Turn around, slowly.

06:01.151 --> 06:03.614
Slower, like a snail
on Quaaludes.

06:05.035 --> 06:06.326
Now move to the counter.

06:09.249 --> 06:10.330
No.

06:11.582 --> 06:12.832
No?

06:12.833 --> 06:14.704
You don't want to help? Fine!

06:14.705 --> 06:17.086
But I am walking out that door
with these bandages,

06:17.087 --> 06:19.567
and the only way you're stopping
me is by pulling that trigger.

06:26.136 --> 06:29.138
Pull your car around back.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.349
We'll unload your friend

06:30.350 --> 06:33.142
and I'm going to help
you take the bullet out.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.565
But if you turn
into Dennis Hopper,

06:35.566 --> 06:36.976
I will shoot you!

06:36.977 --> 06:40.230
I promise you, I'm Keanu Reeves.

07:07.347 --> 07:10.009
Look, will you drop it? It's just
a road trip to an observatory.

07:10.010 --> 07:11.050
It's just weird.

07:11.051 --> 07:13.893
You asked for Beth McCoy's
birth certificate

07:13.894 --> 07:16.686
and a urine sample, before
we went to frigging prom!

07:16.687 --> 07:19.398
Well, you were 17 years old,
Holden's not.

07:19.399 --> 07:21.561
Stop with the
older-brother syndrome!

07:21.562 --> 07:24.363
What, no fresh-squeezed
orange juice?

07:24.364 --> 07:26.826
You should be making
me breakfast,

07:26.827 --> 07:29.028
before I go to work.

07:29.029 --> 07:30.409
I am looking for a job.

07:30.410 --> 07:31.871
Really?

07:31.872 --> 07:34.574
Yeah. I even got rejected by
that Fro-yo place at the mall,

07:34.575 --> 07:36.836
because I don't speak Spanish...
in Kansas!

07:36.837 --> 07:38.418
Buenos Dias.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.041
Honey.

07:42.042 --> 07:43.673
At the interview they asked me

07:43.674 --> 07:46.756
if I could be any type of animal,
what kind of animal would I be?

07:46.757 --> 07:48.849
How is that relevant
for frozen yogurt?

07:50.300 --> 07:51.931
Are you wearing
Tom's aftershave?

07:51.932 --> 07:53.893
Oh, I guess so.

07:53.894 --> 07:55.474
I just found it
in the medicine cabinet.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.017
I wish you wouldn't.

07:58.599 --> 08:00.900
- Ow!
- Oh.

08:00.901 --> 08:03.153
Yes, I'm still on hold.
Did you find the file?

08:04.815 --> 08:06.986
He's a 17-year-old
homeless boy,

08:06.987 --> 08:09.238
and he has
a pregnant girlfriend.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.780
I'm his social worker.

08:10.781 --> 08:13.163
I'm just trying to get him
into a vocational tech school.

08:14.615 --> 08:17.417
Yes. I'll hold... again!

08:21.211 --> 08:23.042
A force of nature, your mom.

08:23.043 --> 08:24.544
She seems frazzled this morning.

08:24.545 --> 08:25.886
Just this morning?

08:28.889 --> 08:31.591
So, is... this
a regular thing?

08:31.592 --> 08:33.183
Semi-regular.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.977
After you went to college,
Luke, your mother and I...

08:37.977 --> 08:39.139
You know what? I...

08:40.140 --> 08:41.231
I don't want to know.

08:46.196 --> 08:48.818
You know, down at Helping
Hands, we could...

08:48.819 --> 08:51.200
Look, Ian...

08:51.201 --> 08:55.575
I respect your hustle to try to get folks
to volunteer for your charity, but...

08:55.576 --> 08:56.916
We can pay you.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.118
Like a real job.

08:59.499 --> 09:02.833
And, if you think the girls
at church are cute...

09:07.127 --> 09:08.128
You in?

09:11.842 --> 09:13.804
Sí, señor.

09:16.266 --> 09:17.977
The plan was sound.

09:17.978 --> 09:21.271
Might have gone down the same way even
if McArdle hadn't crashed the party.

09:23.443 --> 09:25.315
I'm bringing them in,
come hell or high water.

09:27.648 --> 09:30.149
Are you there?
Shoemacher?

09:30.150 --> 09:31.400
I'm listening.

09:31.401 --> 09:34.243
I'm just waiting for you to tell
me how you plan to fix it.

09:34.244 --> 09:36.956
- Holden got plugged.
- Ergo, we have a literal

09:36.957 --> 09:38.327
blood trail to follow.

09:38.328 --> 09:39.869
Like breadcrumbs.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.081
Safe to assume they're
not going to a hospital.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.755
Don't confuse
assumptions with facts.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.128
I've called every hospital
within a hundred miles.

09:49.129 --> 09:51.170
No Holdens.
No John Does.

09:51.171 --> 09:54.133
Sending one of my people
in person to double check.

09:54.134 --> 09:55.975
Well, McArdle's seen combat.

09:55.976 --> 09:57.176
Probably seen his fair share

09:57.177 --> 09:59.098
of gunshot wounds.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.722
If he's planning on cutting out the bullet
himself, they'll still need supplies.

10:02.723 --> 10:06.646
Every hen-house,
outhouse, doghouse?

10:06.647 --> 10:07.648
No.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.901
There's only two farm-towns
within spitting distance.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.073
Options are limited.

10:14.284 --> 10:16.155
You have to ask yourself,
"Where would you go

10:16.156 --> 10:18.117
if you needed to
patch up a bullet wound?"

10:18.118 --> 10:21.040
Especially if you didn't want to
draw any undue attention.

10:21.041 --> 10:22.042
Exactly.

10:23.243 --> 10:24.293
And the girl?

10:24.294 --> 10:26.125
Oh, I'm not worried
about Charlie.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.806
I've a pretty good idea
where she's headed.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.510
And hey, worse come to worse,

10:31.511 --> 10:33.633
we know Holden has to
come home sometime.

10:41.221 --> 10:42.022
How is he?

10:42.023 --> 10:43.603
He's in and out.

10:46.226 --> 10:49.188
You ever dig out a bullet
in your Zero Dark Thirty days?

10:49.189 --> 10:50.609
Not exactly.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.571
So, what, you were
just going to wing it?

10:52.572 --> 10:54.193
Yeah, I...

10:54.194 --> 10:55.535
I think I have an idea.

10:57.868 --> 10:59.950
You keep fighting.
You hear me, Holden?

11:02.783 --> 11:06.245
No. I think forceps and bandages are
going to be a lot more handy than...

11:06.246 --> 11:07.917
Ronin and Black Hawk Down?

11:07.918 --> 11:10.089
Two of the best self-surgery
scenes in the movies.

11:10.090 --> 11:11.421
This isn't a movie!

11:12.592 --> 11:14.004
It kinda is.

11:31.021 --> 11:33.483
At times like, this I really
miss Fort Reed, Kansas.

11:35.575 --> 11:37.948
The smell of those cinnamon
rolls on Maplewood Street.

11:47.127 --> 11:49.248
Luke and I, we...

11:49.249 --> 11:51.330
we used to like
Butch and Sundance.

11:51.331 --> 11:54.674
We'd always freeze-frame during shootouts,
just like the end of the movie.

11:56.296 --> 11:58.048
I miss him.

12:06.186 --> 12:08.227
We'll get you home.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.610
Our wizard in the hot-air
balloon isn't far away now.

12:13.153 --> 12:16.273
Don't suppose there's any chance that
your friend's an actual wizard, is there?

12:18.028 --> 12:19.529
Just asking.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.714
It means
"Don't let them in."

12:35.966 --> 12:37.716
I hope "them" doesn't mean us.

12:37.717 --> 12:39.469
These temples are safe havens.

12:40.931 --> 12:42.181
You know that.

12:42.182 --> 12:44.144
What's so special
about this one?

12:51.481 --> 12:52.522
Arthur?

12:53.563 --> 12:55.105
I've found... someone.

12:57.107 --> 12:58.107
Holden, this is Arthur...

12:59.029 --> 13:00.070
my grandfather.

13:01.661 --> 13:02.701
Grandfather?

13:02.702 --> 13:04.905
I've been waiting
to meet you, Holden.

13:15.175 --> 13:17.676
I need you to hold the wound open and
keep pressure on the top of the leg.

13:17.677 --> 13:20.840
Yurek, you're going to take the
feet and a flashlight. On my count.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.011
You're full of pain killers.

13:22.012 --> 13:23.132
Get the bullet out,

13:23.133 --> 13:25.184
sew you up and
get you back home.

13:25.185 --> 13:27.056
Call my parents.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.428
Tell them I'm okay.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.020
Okay?

13:31.021 --> 13:32.191
You got it.

13:32.192 --> 13:33.192
And if something happens,

13:33.193 --> 13:34.773
contact Willa with my phone.

13:34.774 --> 13:36.396
Nothing's going to happen.
You hear me?

13:37.988 --> 13:39.359
How we doing with the supplies?

13:40.570 --> 13:41.741
They make it look so easy.

13:42.993 --> 13:44.865
You're cleaning
that wound, right?

13:47.747 --> 13:49.950
Sorry, buddy,
this is going to burn.

13:56.546 --> 13:59.088
Willa said you could
get me home.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.920
It's not up to me, Holden.

14:00.921 --> 14:02.051
It's up to you.

14:02.052 --> 14:05.174
He survived the Wilds.
Most people don't.

14:05.175 --> 14:07.096
Doesn't mean the Realm
is done with him.

14:07.097 --> 14:10.179
It's purpose is
to derail your odyssey.

14:10.180 --> 14:12.102
My... odyssey?

14:13.143 --> 14:15.355
Death is what
gives life meaning.

14:16.436 --> 14:18.818
But the two must
always remain separate.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.153
Wow! Hope that fortune
cookie was delicious.

14:25.035 --> 14:26.115
My life's purpose

14:26.116 --> 14:29.448
is dedicated to preventing
humankind from reaching too far,

14:29.449 --> 14:32.161
crossing a bridge that
should never be crossed.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.754
You can help me
prevent a catastrophe.

14:36.206 --> 14:36.997
And, Holden,

14:36.998 --> 14:38.627
when you succeed,

14:38.628 --> 14:40.089
you'll wake up
in that hospital bed

14:40.090 --> 14:42.342
and you can go back
to your life.

14:43.503 --> 14:44.764
Back to Butch and Sundance.

14:46.346 --> 14:47.347
Okay, so...

14:48.638 --> 14:52.061
I'm here to help
prevent something,

14:52.062 --> 14:55.314
somewhere, and you need a guide?

14:55.315 --> 14:57.017
I need to ask more of you.

14:58.318 --> 14:59.728
But first...

14:59.729 --> 15:01.321
there's important preparation.

15:05.075 --> 15:06.115
When do we start?

15:06.116 --> 15:08.077
Holden finally remembered.

15:08.078 --> 15:09.989
He never wants to
go back in the Realm.

15:09.990 --> 15:13.082
He has to go back. We need
Holden to finish the job.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.704
Frost is interfering in
the Realm, sending people in.

15:15.705 --> 15:16.835
He's very close.

15:16.836 --> 15:18.168
You mean your former partner?

15:19.589 --> 15:21.131
The man you
built the machine with?

15:23.093 --> 15:25.094
I found the tapes...

15:25.095 --> 15:26.426
in your safe.

15:30.390 --> 15:31.641
You kept a lot from me.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.235
Celeste.

15:47.117 --> 15:48.278
My mother.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.452
You lied about who she was.

15:53.573 --> 15:55.494
My whole life I had no idea.

15:55.495 --> 15:57.246
Not even her name.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.748
I had to find out from one of
your old research assistants.

15:59.749 --> 16:01.750
I... I did it
to protect you.

16:01.751 --> 16:03.172
To protect me?

16:03.173 --> 16:04.713
From what?

16:04.714 --> 16:06.086
From the truth?

16:08.218 --> 16:09.639
What happened to my mother?

16:11.141 --> 16:13.222
When your mother
went into her coma,

16:13.223 --> 16:16.225
the only thing that kept me going
was the hope that she might wake up

16:16.226 --> 16:17.687
and see you, Willa.

16:18.938 --> 16:20.730
But it just wasn't meant to be.

16:23.063 --> 16:24.444
Frost couldn't accept it.

16:25.445 --> 16:27.125
He thought he could
bring her back himself.

16:28.318 --> 16:30.320
He attached Celeste
to that machine...

16:31.741 --> 16:33.073
and he killed her.

16:37.707 --> 16:40.580
Isaac Frost is my father,
isn't he?

16:42.962 --> 16:44.963
Is that why you kept him
from me for all these years?

16:44.964 --> 16:48.007
I didn't need
to keep Isaac away.

16:49.719 --> 16:51.431
He never once asked to see you.

16:57.097 --> 17:00.979
Lidocaine HCL,
a local anesthetic.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.311
It should numb the pain.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.313
What movie did you see that in?

17:04.314 --> 17:07.146
No movie.
I'm a pharmacist.

17:18.208 --> 17:19.538
- All right.
- Hand me the forceps.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.540
All right. Now I need
you to grab that clamp

17:22.541 --> 17:23.791
and pry the wound open.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.044
You want me to pry the what?

17:26.045 --> 17:28.838
I need you to make the incision
wider, to extract the bullet.

17:30.130 --> 17:32.050
Just like Josh Hartman.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.173
- Black Hawk Down.
- Yeah.

17:34.174 --> 17:36.435
Now I'll...
I'll get the bullet,

17:36.436 --> 17:38.678
and you mop up any
excess blood with the bandages.

17:40.390 --> 17:42.060
Hey, this is real life,
not a movie!

17:42.061 --> 17:43.483
I don't do real life.

17:48.148 --> 17:50.068
My friend is in trouble,

17:50.069 --> 17:51.151
and I need your help.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.113
You've got this.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.041
All right.

18:08.168 --> 18:09.758
Reach into the flames.

18:09.759 --> 18:13.212
Open your mind.
Allow yourself to surrender.

18:13.213 --> 18:14.594
You won't feel a thing.

18:28.728 --> 18:29.779
Ow!

18:34.154 --> 18:36.655
You said that wouldn't hurt!

18:36.656 --> 18:39.117
You stuck your hand
in fire, Holden.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.500
What did you expect?

18:44.083 --> 18:45.335
Do it again.

18:49.549 --> 18:52.341
Is it out? Are you done?
Is he fine?

18:52.342 --> 18:54.714
Almost there.
Hey, you're doing great.

19:00.019 --> 19:01.681
What the hell is that?

19:05.104 --> 19:07.065
The pain is
in your mind, Holden.

19:07.066 --> 19:08.728
It's just a recollection.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.190
Couldn't you have me just...

19:11.191 --> 19:13.572
I don't know...
Wax a car?

19:13.573 --> 19:16.825
Willa's seen you
manipulate the elements.

19:16.826 --> 19:18.488
This fire is no different.

19:41.801 --> 19:43.352
Ah! Got it!

19:43.353 --> 19:45.104
Hold down on the wound
as hard as you can.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.038
Let me do that. I used to sew
up holes in my dad's clothes.

20:11.331 --> 20:14.594
Okay. Hold him still
while I do this.

20:23.933 --> 20:25.054
Why are...

20:26.055 --> 20:28.517
Why are we leaving the temple?

20:28.518 --> 20:30.189
Willa?

20:33.112 --> 20:35.113
Surviving in the Realm

20:35.114 --> 20:37.616
is more than just
manipulating the elements.

20:37.617 --> 20:41.199
It's about preparing
your mind for the dangers.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.240
I've seen those dangers.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.493
No.

20:44.864 --> 20:46.075
You haven't.

20:54.213 --> 20:55.675
What am I looking for?

20:58.047 --> 20:59.339
Arthur?

21:02.592 --> 21:03.593
Arthur?

21:07.016 --> 21:08.727
He's burning up.

21:08.728 --> 21:11.099
Go grab the ice packs

21:11.100 --> 21:13.152
out of the refrigerator
behind the counter.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.631
Glad to see the kid sleeping.

22:22.632 --> 22:25.884
Five doses of Oxycodone
will do that.

22:25.885 --> 22:28.136
You're pretty cool under fire.

22:28.137 --> 22:31.059
For a small-town
pharmacist.

22:31.060 --> 22:32.061
For anybody.

22:33.062 --> 22:35.063
I've been in
tight situations before.

22:35.064 --> 22:37.606
Today, you definitely
had my six.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.528
I mean my...

22:39.529 --> 22:41.319
I know what "six" means.

22:41.320 --> 22:44.073
Lydia, by the way.
My name is Lydia.

22:45.445 --> 22:46.945
I can see that.

22:46.946 --> 22:49.157
- I'm Jeff-
- McArdle.

22:49.158 --> 22:51.700
Yeah. You said, earlier.

22:51.701 --> 22:53.413
And that's Holden Matthews.

22:54.794 --> 22:55.955
Who's after your friend?

22:57.046 --> 22:58.707
Guys with guns.

22:58.708 --> 23:00.879
Part of a cult or...

23:00.880 --> 23:02.711
religious zealots maybe.

23:02.712 --> 23:06.054
The Da Vinci Code,
or Rosemary's Baby?

23:06.055 --> 23:09.138
I think these guys fall outside
the Judeo-Christian spectrum.

23:16.185 --> 23:17.727
Forgot to call his folks.

23:18.778 --> 23:20.058
Told him I'd
tell them he's okay.

23:26.195 --> 23:27.696
That's the front door buzzer.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.578
I put the "gone fishing"
sign up, but...

23:29.579 --> 23:31.330
somebody must really
want their dope.

23:45.755 --> 23:47.095
Hi, Gladys.

23:47.096 --> 23:50.549
I know you came for your medication,
but it won't be ready until tomorrow.

23:50.550 --> 23:54.012
No. I remember
you said Thursday.

23:54.013 --> 23:57.015
Today is Wednesday, Gladys.

23:57.016 --> 23:58.608
Wednesday?

24:00.359 --> 24:02.110
He's shown

24:02.111 --> 24:04.272
full compliance
with his parole officer.

24:04.273 --> 24:06.655
You know what?
You've been a tremendous help.

24:06.656 --> 24:09.407
I'm just going to call Murray directly.
He's an old friend of mine.

24:09.408 --> 24:13.281
Knowing Murray,
I'm sure he will fire you.

24:13.282 --> 24:15.802
But you should have thought about
that before you pissed me off!

24:18.498 --> 24:20.208
Sorry.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.529
Sometimes it's
like pulling teeth.

24:23.002 --> 24:24.963
Thank you so much
for cleaning up.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.384
Hey, growing up, we had a rule:

24:26.385 --> 24:28.927
If you weren't in the kitchen cooking,
you were in the kitchen cleaning.

24:28.928 --> 24:31.801
I should have that put on a
plaque and put it on the wall.

24:32.892 --> 24:35.013
Tom and the boys were
hopeless in that department.

24:35.014 --> 24:37.016
- How is Tom?
- He's fine. He's...

24:38.097 --> 24:39.478
It's complicated.

24:40.810 --> 24:43.191
He's hanging out
with Jeff McArdle now,

24:43.192 --> 24:44.564
if that's any indication.

24:45.695 --> 24:47.776
Jeff, the war vet.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.488
Yeah, he's come
to church on occasion.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.160
Never says much.

24:52.161 --> 24:53.532
Can you blame him?

24:53.533 --> 24:56.284
He served two tours in Iraq.

24:56.285 --> 24:59.208
Yeah. Maybe he'd be interested
in the discussion group.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.329
What would you discuss with him?

25:01.330 --> 25:03.882
Well, losing his
brother recently,

25:03.883 --> 25:06.044
He may need to
open up about life...

25:06.045 --> 25:07.295
and life lost.

25:07.296 --> 25:11.090
And consider the important obstacles
that come between the two.

25:12.051 --> 25:13.593
Sometimes it helps with healing.

25:14.724 --> 25:16.635
Sure.

25:16.636 --> 25:18.978
I'm sure a war vet
could benefit from that.

25:20.139 --> 25:22.141
Mission accomplished!

25:23.522 --> 25:24.944
Spotless.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.952
Is this how bullets that go
into people normally look?

25:35.785 --> 25:37.036
No. Definitely not.

25:38.748 --> 25:39.999
Looks like it melted.

25:45.965 --> 25:48.837
What if I told you "insane"
was working 50 hours a week

25:48.838 --> 25:51.590
in some office for 50 years, at the end
of which they tell you to piss off,

25:51.591 --> 25:53.551
ending up in some
retirement village,

25:53.552 --> 25:55.513
hoping to die before
suffering the indignity

25:55.514 --> 25:57.676
of trying to make it
to the toilet on time?

25:57.677 --> 26:00.348
Wouldn't you consider
that to be insane?

26:00.349 --> 26:03.061
All right, Lydia, give it up.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.643
What's with the
action movie Jones?

26:04.644 --> 26:06.394
I don't know.

26:06.395 --> 26:09.277
Doesn't everyone worship
at the holy trinity

26:09.278 --> 26:11.029
of Stallone, Willis,
and Schwarzenegger?

26:11.030 --> 26:13.612
Everyone over 40, yeah.

26:13.613 --> 26:16.075
Wait! Van Damme didn't
make the cut?

26:17.076 --> 26:21.370
Aha! So you're
in the closet too.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.414
Never hate on the
Muscles from Brussels.

26:27.046 --> 26:28.166
Ever see Bloodsport?

26:28.167 --> 26:29.799
Only 900 times!

26:31.801 --> 26:35.553
But... I'm not a
movie guy any more.

26:35.554 --> 26:37.345
Who is these days?

26:37.346 --> 26:41.099
My dad would be yelling at
the screen, with all this...

26:41.100 --> 26:43.642
franchise superhero stuff.

26:43.643 --> 26:44.853
They're barely movies.

26:44.854 --> 26:46.985
They're definitely
not real life.

26:46.986 --> 26:48.687
But you don't do real life.

26:48.688 --> 26:50.069
Well, real life sucks...

26:52.652 --> 26:54.032
most of the time.

26:54.033 --> 26:56.155
Hey.

26:57.576 --> 26:58.828
Hey.

27:04.203 --> 27:06.584
Hey! Thanks for the backup.

27:06.585 --> 27:08.006
You seemed fine to me.

27:08.007 --> 27:11.750
Okay. Okay. I see
what you're doing.

27:11.751 --> 27:14.713
You push me to my breaking point
so I'll find my true potential?

27:14.714 --> 27:16.304
I guess you've got it
all figured out.

27:16.305 --> 27:18.056
Look, I say Karate Kid,
all of them.

27:18.057 --> 27:20.849
I'm a Miyagi aficionado.
I get how this works.

27:20.850 --> 27:23.061
What I don't get is
what the hell I'm training for!

27:23.062 --> 27:25.934
You are supposed to control this
place, not let it control you.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.525
I could have been killed!

27:27.526 --> 27:30.028
If you'd have been killed, it would prove
you're not the one we're looking for.

27:30.029 --> 27:31.860
- So you're willing
to let me die?

27:31.861 --> 27:34.152
Do it, Holden. Do it!

27:34.153 --> 27:35.984
Let the fire inside you rage.

27:35.985 --> 27:37.485
No holding back.

27:37.486 --> 27:39.277
Let out your true self, Holden.

27:39.278 --> 27:41.991
Do it, Holden.
Do it. Do it now.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.554
You wanted to lose control...

27:56.555 --> 27:58.426
but you stopped it.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.559
- That's a sign of strength.
- Yeah.

28:01.761 --> 28:04.353
I have to use that strength
to go back in, don't I?

28:07.066 --> 28:11.309
That's... where I have to go,
what I have to face to get home.

28:11.310 --> 28:13.362
Quickly now.
There's more to do.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.614
What about all
that crap you said about...

28:16.615 --> 28:19.577
preventing humankind
from reaching too far?

28:19.578 --> 28:21.489
Because, honestly, this...

28:21.490 --> 28:24.032
This all feels way too far.

28:24.033 --> 28:25.493
Not for you.

28:25.494 --> 28:27.536
You're the one, Holden.

28:29.038 --> 28:31.090
I knew Gandalf was
going to say that.

28:40.049 --> 28:41.140
Here you go.

28:43.262 --> 28:45.103
Is it your first time here?

28:45.104 --> 28:46.685
Like a virgin.

28:48.978 --> 28:50.019
Pastor Ian's a, um...

28:52.061 --> 28:53.151
friend of my mom's.

28:53.152 --> 28:56.024
Said he was going to
put me on the payroll.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.696
Wait! You're getting paid?

28:58.697 --> 28:59.909
Which I assume you're not.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.121
Don't I feel like a total loser!

29:03.122 --> 29:05.784
It's fine.
A guy's got to eat.

29:05.785 --> 29:07.956
I've been volunteering
for a few months.

29:07.957 --> 29:09.247
My whole family does.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.040
My family's group activity
usually involves

29:12.041 --> 29:13.422
resentment and lasagna.

29:15.004 --> 29:16.004
Funny!

29:17.006 --> 29:18.007
Not really.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.219
You're the one whose
brother was in a coma?

29:21.220 --> 29:23.471
Ian's mentioned him before,

29:23.472 --> 29:26.185
here at the charity,
but also in group.

29:26.976 --> 29:28.096
Group?

29:28.097 --> 29:29.147
Oh.

29:29.148 --> 29:30.850
I thought...

29:32.061 --> 29:34.062
There's this support group...

29:34.063 --> 29:36.104
They're called Hollow Sky...

29:36.105 --> 29:38.107
For people who have
lost loved ones.

29:39.158 --> 29:40.399
My older brother died.

29:41.821 --> 29:44.362
But Ian showed us
how to transform our pain

29:44.363 --> 29:46.906
into something... positive.

29:48.207 --> 29:49.458
Beyond this world.

29:52.001 --> 29:53.963
Sorry about your brother.

29:58.177 --> 29:59.717
That pin?

29:59.718 --> 30:01.180
Is that what it represents?

30:04.924 --> 30:06.185
Now it's yours.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.687
I, uh... I don't...

30:09.688 --> 30:11.559
It's okay. No, it's yours.

30:11.560 --> 30:14.192
- It has special meaning for you.
- They have hundreds of them in the back room.

30:14.193 --> 30:15.194
Here.

30:17.196 --> 30:18.197
Thanks.

30:31.370 --> 30:33.211
You still close
with your old man?

30:33.212 --> 30:35.164
My dad died when I was sixteen.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.257
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
- It's okay.

30:39.258 --> 30:42.090
I got emancipated,

30:42.091 --> 30:44.093
got my own place.
Even got this job.

30:45.174 --> 30:47.886
But... you don't have your dad.

30:47.887 --> 30:50.059
Well, I've got Chuck...

30:51.100 --> 30:52.310
and Clint,

30:52.311 --> 30:55.103
and Mel, and Nick.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.145
The "Holy Trinity."

30:57.276 --> 30:58.897
I get it.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.068
Dad loved them.

31:00.069 --> 31:01.981
I know you think I'm weird...

31:03.282 --> 31:05.363
hero worship, and all that.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.656
But it sucks to think that
when no one is in control,

31:08.657 --> 31:09.948
bad stuff happens.

31:09.949 --> 31:11.990
There's no rhyme or reason
for any of it.

31:11.991 --> 31:13.161
Exactly!

31:13.162 --> 31:16.204
Why do I watch the
same stuff over and over?

31:16.205 --> 31:19.417
Because I always know what
my guys are going to do.

31:19.418 --> 31:20.999
You're safe with them.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.921
I get that.

31:22.922 --> 31:24.133
But you...

31:25.504 --> 31:28.506
Your friend needed you to dig
a bullet out of his shoulder,

31:28.507 --> 31:31.640
so you dug a bullet
out of his shoulder.

31:33.272 --> 31:35.184
You don't wait for
things to happen to you.

31:36.976 --> 31:38.316
Yeah. Well...

31:38.317 --> 31:39.687
can't save everybody.

31:39.688 --> 31:41.280
That's for sure.

31:45.114 --> 31:46.445
I learned that the hard way.

31:49.158 --> 31:51.529
I lost my little brother
not too long ago.

31:51.530 --> 31:55.163
He was Holden's best friend
when we were kids.

31:55.164 --> 31:56.624
Sorry.

31:56.625 --> 31:59.798
No. Me and my bro,
we weren't close.

32:02.171 --> 32:04.212
He was the good college student.

32:04.213 --> 32:06.966
I was the guy inventing
new ways to screw up.

32:08.347 --> 32:11.390
I... I always tried
to protect him, but...

32:13.182 --> 32:15.184
bad stuff happened anyways.

32:17.856 --> 32:19.147
But now...

32:19.148 --> 32:21.110
now I've got to
be here for Holden.

32:22.521 --> 32:24.023
I'm going where
the universe tells me.

32:25.364 --> 32:26.986
Universe, my ass!

32:28.027 --> 32:30.198
Who needs a higher power?

32:30.199 --> 32:32.200
Jeff McArdle and his...

32:32.201 --> 32:35.333
gnarly, yet disarmingly
attractive scar

32:35.334 --> 32:36.495
has got it handled.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.080
What's so special
about him anyway?

32:42.131 --> 32:44.043
Still trying to figure that out.

32:45.674 --> 32:48.297
- Like Morpheus does in The Matrix.
- Haven't seen it.

32:53.642 --> 32:55.183
Gladys Feldman

32:55.184 --> 32:56.974
must have forgotten she came by.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.517
Or it's Thursday.

33:12.611 --> 33:14.492
Sorry, sir. We're closed.

33:14.493 --> 33:18.206
Really? I've got
this huge headache.

33:18.207 --> 33:21.079
It's a migraine actually.

33:21.080 --> 33:24.212
Sorry. Can't help you.

33:24.213 --> 33:26.505
- Try the Piggly Wiggly
down the street.

33:34.263 --> 33:35.304
I will.

33:36.845 --> 33:38.016
Thank you.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.068
Jackpot!

33:50.109 --> 33:51.699
Pharmacy's closed
when it shouldn't be.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.112
Pill pusher's blood on her coat.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.414
So what's the plan?
We go in and grab 'em?

33:56.415 --> 33:58.076
No. We drive off,

33:58.077 --> 34:00.208
act like we're
going to the Piggly Wiggly.

34:00.209 --> 34:02.870
But we're not going
to the Piggly Wiggly?

34:02.871 --> 34:06.003
No. We're not going
to the Piggly Wiggly.

34:06.004 --> 34:08.603
We're going to circle the block and
park in that alley over there.

34:09.467 --> 34:10.719
Then what?

34:14.553 --> 34:16.844
Smoke 'em if you've got 'em.

34:21.389 --> 34:24.141
Those people looking
for you and Holden,

34:24.143 --> 34:26.184
- I think they found you.
- Who was at the door?

34:26.185 --> 34:29.025
Forty-ish, definitely
an early '70s vibe

34:29.027 --> 34:30.487
as far as villains go.

34:30.489 --> 34:33.110
Glasses, shifty eyes,
sweaty brow,

34:33.112 --> 34:35.534
and an ugly yellow jacket.

34:38.286 --> 34:40.328
Hey. I think he's
coming down off his high.

34:40.329 --> 34:43.000
Hey, buddy, if you can hear me,
now's a good time to wake up.

34:43.001 --> 34:46.545
Holden, wake up! Holden!

35:06.225 --> 35:08.026
Cool logo.

35:09.938 --> 35:11.229
Is that your company?

35:11.230 --> 35:13.152
No. It's not my company.

35:14.193 --> 35:16.444
I don't even really have a job.

35:16.445 --> 35:19.157
Oh, thought it was some hip
startup I should know about.

35:19.158 --> 35:20.699
Next.

35:23.001 --> 35:24.373
I'll get a...

35:26.004 --> 35:30.128
large Nutella, blended, with
extra cream and caramel, please.

35:33.752 --> 35:36.594
- I seem to have misplaced my wallet.
- I got it.

35:36.595 --> 35:39.427
Ring me up for his
delicious-sounding dessert-drink,

35:39.428 --> 35:40.969
and a double espresso for me.

35:43.562 --> 35:46.103
Thank you. That's
very nice of you.

35:46.104 --> 35:47.105
It's my pleasure.

35:48.687 --> 35:49.858
Oh, is that yours?

35:51.860 --> 35:52.941
Smooth!

35:56.275 --> 35:58.536
- Here.
- No. Keep it.

35:58.537 --> 36:00.489
Put it towards
your next startup.

36:51.630 --> 36:54.211
They're trying to smoke us out.
You stay here with him.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.213
Where are you going?

36:56.425 --> 36:58.136
To find them before
they find us.

36:59.177 --> 37:00.897
Little hand says
it's time to rock and roll.

37:39.968 --> 37:42.090
Sit tight.
I'll be right back.

37:55.023 --> 37:58.106
I can't... I can't do this.

38:46.204 --> 38:47.406
Where's the kid?

38:50.909 --> 38:52.160
He in the back room?

38:54.913 --> 38:57.375
Pop quiz, hotshot.

38:57.376 --> 38:59.006
You have a gun on my friend,

38:59.007 --> 39:01.218
and I have
a .44 magnum on you.

39:01.219 --> 39:02.760
What do you do?

39:02.761 --> 39:05.464
Lydia, come on now.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.427
I tell you what you're gonna do.

39:09.428 --> 39:12.020
You're gonna
turn around, slowly.

39:13.562 --> 39:14.733
Slower!

39:19.237 --> 39:20.238
Really?

39:21.319 --> 39:24.362
I bet you don't even
know how to u... ooh!

39:28.156 --> 39:29.578
Is that not how you use it?

39:30.699 --> 39:32.700
- Hey. Go check on Holden, Okay?
- Okay.

39:32.701 --> 39:35.163
And don't lock me out, in case
I decide to wander back.

39:36.254 --> 39:37.255
Hey.

39:38.707 --> 39:40.168
I think dad would be proud.

39:41.089 --> 39:43.341
Yippee-ki-yay, mother...

39:48.096 --> 39:51.008
Yeah. I actually built
a phone app in high school.

39:51.009 --> 39:54.101
But when I finished, there was already
four other apps just like it.

39:54.102 --> 39:57.354
Yeah.
That's what happens.

39:57.355 --> 39:58.477
Tough racket.

40:01.109 --> 40:03.360
I'm stuck
visiting family, but...

40:03.361 --> 40:06.825
if you are looking for a job, I might
be able to tug on a string or two.

40:08.196 --> 40:10.788
That's insanely nice of you.

40:10.789 --> 40:12.950
Well, what can I say?

40:12.951 --> 40:13.992
I like to pay it forward.

40:23.211 --> 40:24.251
Good new?

40:24.252 --> 40:25.884
Big contract.

40:27.385 --> 40:29.047
I wasn't sure
we were going to land.

40:36.104 --> 40:39.978
Anyway, I am happy to help.

40:41.560 --> 40:42.981
Good luck.

40:45.824 --> 40:46.825
Thanks.

40:53.622 --> 40:55.283
Ow!

40:56.284 --> 40:58.036
Jesus.

40:59.628 --> 41:00.789
At last.

41:06.044 --> 41:07.886
Just had to
follow the breadcrumbs.
