WEBVTT

00:32.420 --> 00:33.460
Thanks.

00:57.540 --> 00:58.580
Morning.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.860
Toothbrush to a
murder weapon.

01:11.860 --> 01:13.300
Anything can be a weapon...

01:13.300 --> 01:14.740
if you have enough
time on your hands.

01:14.740 --> 01:16.020
We know they've
got plenty of that.

01:16.020 --> 01:17.260
Is this them?
Yeah.

01:17.260 --> 01:18.820
They're the guys that
were playing ball.

01:19.220 --> 01:21.380
Shut your mouth and keep
your hands on your head.

01:22.660 --> 01:23.860
How about you?

01:24.900 --> 01:26.140
What's your name?

01:27.180 --> 01:28.940
Come on, partner,
what's your name?

01:29.460 --> 01:31.300
Ramirez, Rico.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.460
Booking number 9397489.

01:36.740 --> 01:37.820
What'd you say
your name was?

01:37.820 --> 01:38.940
Ramirez.

01:38.940 --> 01:40.140
You deaf or something?

01:40.140 --> 01:41.940
Did you forget your name
when you got this tattoo?

01:41.940 --> 01:43.420
We've got a bracelet
switch here.

01:43.420 --> 01:44.860
We've been in lockdown
for half an hour.

01:44.860 --> 01:46.620
We just started
to check I.D.s.

01:46.620 --> 01:48.020
What's that?

01:48.020 --> 01:49.620
This airspace is restricted.

01:49.620 --> 01:51.500
Someone get on the
horn to air patrol.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.020
Get that chopper out of here.

01:53.020 --> 01:54.620
Air patrol doesn't fly a-stars.

01:54.620 --> 01:55.940
This murder is a decoy.

01:55.940 --> 01:58.020
We have an
escape in progress.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.460
Officer down!

02:34.980 --> 02:35.900
This is Horatio Caine.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.660
You have a 39-escapee.

02:37.660 --> 02:40.380
You have a westbound chopper
from the Miami detention center.

02:40.380 --> 02:43.180
Three fugitives aboard,
A and D.  I repeat,

02:43.180 --> 02:45.060
they are armed
and dangerous.

03:23.100 --> 03:26.220
1x24 Body Count

03:37.280 --> 03:38.240
Head count?

03:38.240 --> 03:41.040
Two hundred inmates in
each of six gen-pop modules.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.120
Another three hundred
keep-aways...

03:43.120 --> 03:44.280
in safety cell confinement.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.360
It's going to take time to
count fifteen hundred men.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.640
Fifteen hundred minus three.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.200
We find out who they are,
we'll know where they went.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.080
It's going to be difficult
with the bracelet switch.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.480
We found at least
twenty men...

03:52.480 --> 03:54.640
with switched bracelets
in this module alone.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.640
Lieutenant?
Yeah.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.080
What do we have here?

04:02.440 --> 04:04.040
Bracelet says he's
from this module,

04:04.040 --> 04:06.280
but he's from SCC.
Name:

04:06.280 --> 04:07.720
Joe Aviar.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.520
Likes to rape old women.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.760
We try and keep guys like
this out of general pop.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.000
Inmates tear them up.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.520
Okay, Joe, who forced you
to wear the bracelet?

04:15.520 --> 04:16.880
I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.959
No?
Okay.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.560
Thank you.
"Hank Kerner."

04:23.560 --> 04:24.440
Who's Hank Kerner?

04:24.440 --> 04:25.520
Three-time loser:

04:25.520 --> 04:27.720
Carjacking with
a side of murder.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.400
Partial to temple shots.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.160
He's awaiting trial on ...

04:31.160 --> 04:33.560
a tourist couple that he
capped down in Biscayne.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.680
I know that case.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.200
Hank Kerner was going
away for life; nothing to lose.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.160
Hang on a second.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.280
Horatio.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.320
Yeah.
Okay.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.560
Set up a one-mile perimeter.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.120
I'll be there in ten.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.840
They found the
helicopter downed ...

04:47.840 --> 04:49.160
around Northwest
and Flagler.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.200
Thank you, Joe.

04:59.880 --> 05:00.800
John.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.800
Pedestrians saw the
chopper losing altitude.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.840
First officer thinks
the fuselage was leaking...

05:04.840 --> 05:06.000
from the shoot-out.
Injuries on the ground?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.320
We got lucky.
DBs?

05:07.320 --> 05:08.960
Two dead bodies,
pilot and one passenger.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.680
Alexx, you think they
were killed in the crash?

05:10.680 --> 05:13.000
Not unless they each
crashed into a bullet.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.440
Both victims, single shot
to the head, temple area.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.400
This entrance wound
is all business.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.040
You see something familiar?

05:24.040 --> 05:25.840
Maybe.
I don't know.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.680
"Randall Kaye."
Now, that's familiar.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.520
Wasn't he that stockbroker
from last thanksgiving?

05:30.520 --> 05:31.280
Hit and run?

05:31.280 --> 05:32.920
Dragged a pedestrian
two miles under his car.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.720
Hired the most powerful
attorneys in Palm Beach...

05:34.720 --> 05:36.200
and got three short years.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.160
The question is,
who's the pilot?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.520
License says
"Bryce Kaye."

05:44.520 --> 05:45.680
Must be his brother.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.800
I don't think Bryce was
planning on landing here.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.120
I would agree.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.440
Okay, so if they've been
on the ground forty minutes,

05:52.440 --> 05:54.480
and the average foot
speed is five miles per hour,

05:54.480 --> 05:56.280
we've got a radius of
just a little over three miles.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.200
That means they're
looking for transportation.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.000
Hank Kerner will
be all over that.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.360
I'll put out a bolo for any stolen
vehicles within three miles.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.120
Hank Kerner ...

06:03.120 --> 06:05.240
I thought I recognized
that muzzle stamp.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.080
Let's hope somebody
recognizes him.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.320
Let's put his picture out
on the news and find him.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.040
Thank you, Alexx.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.120
All right.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.240
What's with the no-ac, man?

06:31.240 --> 06:34.080
Had my phone on vibrate,
I was, uh ...

06:34.080 --> 06:35.440
a little busy.
Yeah?

06:35.440 --> 06:36.800
Didn't want to
be interrupted.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.600
Busy with the left hand?

06:38.600 --> 06:39.680
Funny.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.400
So this is Joe Aviar's
original cell, huh?

06:42.400 --> 06:44.600
Guy who likes
to rape elderly women.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.880
Yeah, he switched
wristbands with ...

06:46.880 --> 06:48.960
one of our fugitives,
Hank Kerner.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.400
Three guys locked in the
same cell, and the C.O.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.320
Doesn't recognize them?

06:52.320 --> 06:54.080
He's fresh out
of the academy.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.280
It's his first assignment.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.600
He sees a convict,

06:56.600 --> 06:58.680
he sees their clothes,
not their faces.

06:59.640 --> 07:00.720
All right.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.240
You want upper or lower?

07:03.240 --> 07:04.680
I got here on time.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.400
For once.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.240
Nothing in here.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.520
Stockbroker was
living the dream.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.400
One minute, you're
running the world and,

07:41.400 --> 07:43.240
the next,
you're in a six-by-six.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.000
It's a shock
to the system.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.920
Explains why Randall
would try to escape.

07:46.920 --> 07:47.920
I talked to Horatio.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.720
He thinks Randall and
his brother were ...

07:49.720 --> 07:51.160
used to get the
other two out.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.280
Spark plug.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.600
Wonder where
this came from.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.080
Maybe one of the guys
was taking auto shop.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.320
Yeah, looks like there's
something in the threads.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.040
Some, uh, concrete dust.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.360
These guys weren't driving,
they were digging.

08:28.920 --> 08:31.200
Sewer pipes, air vents.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.840
Any number of ways they could've
gotten to the yard after lockdown.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.320
We got to follow their route.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.120
They might've left us
something ...

08:39.120 --> 08:40.159
that'll lead us to them.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.120
Keep going.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.480
You're doing fine.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.080
Yeah.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.840
Ever tell you I'm
scared of the dark?

08:51.800 --> 08:53.320
Well, next time you're
up for a promotion,

08:53.320 --> 08:54.560
you can mention that.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.720
You see anything?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.200
Yeah.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.320
A kind of tunnel.

08:59.360 --> 09:02.880
That's probably for maintenance,
so means there's an exit.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.080
Light up ahead.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.320
I'll check it out.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.840
You ask me, this is where
they climbed up to escape.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.320
Wait a minute.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.560
Hold on a second.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.080
Turn slightly to your left.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.160
What is that?

10:01.440 --> 10:02.840
Needle and thread.

10:04.280 --> 10:05.840
It's not from auto shop.

10:05.840 --> 10:06.880
Tailoring.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.480
You think?

10:09.280 --> 10:12.400
I think a guy'll do anything
to get out of a six-by-six cell.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.280
Let's get that stuff
back to the lab.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.080
I'll put in a call to Horatio.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.960
Code 22.
Repeat, code 22.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.480
All radio units,
respond to a carjacking,

10:22.480 --> 10:24.160
seventh and riverside park.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.600
John, what do you got?
Vic's name's Jill Gormley.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.600
Married, two kids.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.080
Drives a black Lincoln navigator.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.200
Wrong place, wrong time.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.160
Single gunshot to the head.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.280
Same as the two guys
in the chopper.

10:37.280 --> 10:38.280
What about witnesses?

10:38.280 --> 10:39.720
Street vendor
saw everything.

10:39.720 --> 10:40.760
Okay.
Thank you, John.

10:40.760 --> 10:41.840
Yelina.
Horatio.

10:41.840 --> 10:42.840
Guillermo Soriano.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.640
Senor,
tell me what you saw.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.200
Did you see which
one took the shot?

11:11.640 --> 11:13.240
A flash.
A big flash.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.840
You remember
a flash first?

11:26.200 --> 11:28.360
You know, he may be
talking about the muzzle flash.

11:28.680 --> 11:29.640
I don't think so.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.560
Eyewitnesses
can be unreliable.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.720
Not when they're
on camera.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.800
That is a traffic
enforcement camera.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.880
Okay, so that's our
victim right there.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.920
The car behind her
runs the red light...

11:56.920 --> 11:58.360
just moments before
she gets shot.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.640
Activating the
traffic camera.

11:59.640 --> 12:03.120
Explains why Mr. Soriano saw a
flash before he heard a gunshot.

12:03.120 --> 12:03.920
Right.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.200
And there's our carjacker.
Zoom in on him.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.240
Sure.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.720
That's Hank Kerner,
but his partner?

12:11.720 --> 12:12.960
We can't see him.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.080
Tyler, these cameras take two
pictures though, don't they?

12:16.080 --> 12:18.360
Yeah, one as you
enter the intersection,

12:18.360 --> 12:21.040
and one in the center.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.560
Still can't see his face.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.000
Zoom in tighter.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.280
That's Stewart Otis.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.520
The child molester?

12:39.520 --> 12:40.960
Convicted child killer.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.920
I put him in jail myself.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.000
She was flirting with me.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.640
Whoopsie-daisy.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.760
I never even
got to play with her.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.600
According to our witness,

13:03.600 --> 13:06.480
this Stewart never even
got into the car.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.680
Maybe Kerner left
him behind.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.840
Yes. The question is,
to do what?

13:14.680 --> 13:18.040
I told Ruthie Crighton's mother
he'd never hurt another child.

13:20.920 --> 13:21.920
Horatio ...

13:21.920 --> 13:23.560
are you okay?
Nope.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.960
Not with Stewart
on the loose.

13:26.360 --> 13:27.400
Nobody is.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.600
Young mother,
and a bullet to the temple.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.840
Two things that
do not go together.

13:47.920 --> 13:51.560
It's a .38 or a .357
with a five right.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.880
Smith & Wesson, Ruger
or a Taurus revolver.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.720
I've got gunpowder
burns ...

13:56.720 --> 13:58.240
with radial tears
around the wound,

13:58.680 --> 13:59.760
figure eight.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.360
And you know what
that means.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.640
A muzzle stamp.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.720
Same as our two bodies
from the helicopter.

14:23.640 --> 14:24.720
The stamp is sideways,

14:24.720 --> 14:26.800
which indicates the shooter
turned his weapon.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.880
That's three for three
on the Hank Kerner chart.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.520
Boy's a regular cowboy.

14:34.520 --> 14:35.880
And a cold-blooded killer.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.160
Calleigh, I don't like this.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.760
You and Kerner
have a history.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.040
I have a history with a lot of
bad guys, Alexx. So do you.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.320
You know Hank Kerner?

14:44.360 --> 14:45.160
Our fugitive?

14:45.160 --> 14:47.000
Yeah, we've been through
two hung juries together.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.560
It's not like we're
picking out china.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.520
You should've told me you
were the CSI on his case.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.720
Didn't he go off in court
threatening everybody?

14:53.720 --> 14:57.560
It was typical chest-beating of
a guy who's facing L-WOP.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.000
His retrial's in two weeks.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.240
That means he's
desperate, Calleigh.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.720
Well, it means we
better catch him...

15:01.720 --> 15:03.400
before the poor guy
misses his court date.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.480
Would you check the old
visitor logs from jail and see...

15:05.480 --> 15:06.520
if you can scare up
the name ...

15:06.520 --> 15:08.200
of someone he might
be hiding out with?

15:08.200 --> 15:09.400
Already did.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.680
Prostitute named
Treynece Banks.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.960
I don't think he'll hide out
so much as make a pit stop.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.200
Well, it's a lead.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.680
Well,
if you guys'll excuse me,

15:16.680 --> 15:17.720
I have to make a call.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.200
And I thought
she blew me off.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.520
Hey, hot pants.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.960
Hey, girl.

15:30.960 --> 15:31.960
Look at you.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.360
What did you do, give up
prosecuting and start modeling?

15:34.360 --> 15:36.720
Oh, right.
God, look at you.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.640
How much to I love
that necklace?

15:39.280 --> 15:41.040
It's an apology
present from dad.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.040
Ah. How is
the old charmer?

15:43.040 --> 15:45.200
He's fine, the same.
You know.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.520
Good to hear.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.560
So ...

15:47.560 --> 15:49.960
I assume you called me about
our old friend Hank Kerner.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.160
I'm worried about the college girl.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.240
She's the only
eyewitness,

15:53.240 --> 15:54.640
and the whole
case rests on her.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.640
I'm one step
ahead of you, Cal.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.200
She's in protective
custody.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.880
24-hour surveillance?

15:59.160 --> 16:00.080
Oh, that's good.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.640
Okay, well,
what about her family?

16:01.640 --> 16:02.920
Norsat's on it.

16:03.960 --> 16:04.720
See?

16:04.720 --> 16:06.040
All that worrying
about nothing.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.080
Yeah.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.680
You catch this guy,

16:08.680 --> 16:10.800
I'll throw away the key
this time, all right, Cal?

16:10.800 --> 16:11.920
Okay.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.920
All right.
We still on for Thursday night?

16:13.920 --> 16:15.320
Yeah,

16:15.320 --> 16:17.120
as long as the workaholic
doesn't cancel on me again.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.680
I'm not a workaholic.

16:18.680 --> 16:21.440
Are you kidding me?
I send your Christmas card to CSI.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.120
I'll see you later, Janet.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.960
We got a carjacker,
a kid killer and a stockbroker.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.320
The only thing they
have in common is...

16:28.320 --> 16:31.000
a burning desire
to get out of the joint.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.800
Okay, this is the stuff
from Stewart's cell.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.000
And Randall Kaye's;
also Aviar's.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.840
Ok, as a sexual predator,

16:36.840 --> 16:39.520
Stewart might
have a diary or letters.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.120
What about his work detail?

16:42.120 --> 16:43.920
Randall was in printing,

16:43.920 --> 16:45.200
Hank was in wood shop...

16:45.200 --> 16:47.040
and Stewart was
assigned to tailoring.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.120
Tailoring?

16:48.560 --> 16:50.560
Found a needle and thread
in their escape tunnel.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.160
And we also got some more
sewing stuff from the cell.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.440
Embroidery hoop,

16:54.440 --> 16:56.080
some thread and some
kind of sticky paper.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.040
It's water soluble
weave stabilizer, uh,

16:58.040 --> 17:00.600
boy scouts, it's used
to make patches.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.280
You mean
like for a uniform?

17:03.960 --> 17:05.599
A fake uniform.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.720
That's how he got
Ruthie Crighton.

17:13.839 --> 17:15.800
So he was making
a disguise.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.760
Okay.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.000
Is this Randall Kaye's family?

17:20.000 --> 17:20.960
Yeah.

17:21.480 --> 17:22.599
That's, uh ...

17:22.599 --> 17:25.000
wife Dawn and
daughter Emma.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.359
Daughter Emma.

17:26.359 --> 17:27.760
How old do you
think she looks?

17:27.760 --> 17:29.160
Six, seven.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.040
Seven.
You see this tape?

17:31.040 --> 17:32.440
It means that
this picture ...

17:32.440 --> 17:34.240
has been taken off
the wall repeatedly.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.840
One man's family album
is another man's porn.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.760
Yes.
This could be his next target.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.200
Yeah, we got to get to
Randall Kaye's house.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.440
Hang on a second.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.800
The thread that Stewart
uses is red,

17:47.800 --> 17:48.840
blue and gray, right?

17:50.680 --> 17:52.880
It's not the house.
We got to get to the school.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.240
It's the school.

18:13.920 --> 18:14.760
Did you find her?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.400
I just talked to
her teacher.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.520
Class was already
let out when you called.

18:18.520 --> 18:19.720
We got to find her.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.040
You think he took any
of the other girls?

18:21.040 --> 18:22.160
No, he wants Emma.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.160
Girls?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.040
Emma?

18:25.440 --> 18:27.200
Are you looking for Emma?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.240
Yeah, I am.
Have you seen her?

18:29.240 --> 18:30.640
She went with that man.

18:30.640 --> 18:31.400
What man?

18:31.400 --> 18:32.440
The new teacher.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.200
Emma?

18:38.200 --> 18:41.080
Hi.
I'm Mr. Andrews.

18:42.440 --> 18:43.320
Hi.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.440
Your mommy told me
to come get you.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.200
He's got her.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.560
Emma.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.720
Emma!

19:05.440 --> 19:06.640
Are you Mrs. Kaye?

19:08.320 --> 19:09.400
Yes.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.440
Mrs. Kaye, about
five minutes ago,

19:11.440 --> 19:13.080
a man took Emma
from the school.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.240
You don't seem too
concerned.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.080
I'm, I'm ...
well, no, I'm ...

19:20.080 --> 19:21.200
I just ...

19:21.200 --> 19:22.280
Nice luggage.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.400
When is that last time you
spoke to your husband?

19:25.840 --> 19:30.000
Okay, my husband
is in jail.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.520
Ma'am,

19:32.520 --> 19:35.120
your husband was killed this
morning escaping from that jail.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.280
I noticed the luggage
in your car.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.560
Were you traveling today?

19:49.440 --> 19:51.880
Mrs. Kaye, you're involved
in this, aren't you?

19:52.840 --> 19:55.760
My daughter was growing
up without a father.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.200
I just wanted my
family back together.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.280
I understand.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.560
Where's Emma?

20:04.960 --> 20:05.960
We believe that
one of the men...

20:05.960 --> 20:09.080
that escaped with your
husband has taken Emma.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.400
Mrs. Kaye,
I need you to focus.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.640
The first twenty-four
hours are crucial.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.880
Sh-should we, uh,
go to the bank?

20:18.880 --> 20:19.720
Listen to me.

20:19.720 --> 20:23.400
I can assure you this man's
interest in Emma is not monetary.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.480
What have I done?

20:28.480 --> 20:30.000
Do you have an article
of her clothing?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.400
For what?
For scent dogs.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.320
We plan to track them,
but we need to do it right now.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.040
Mrs. Kaye?

20:38.120 --> 20:39.840
Lieutenant, please ...

20:40.880 --> 20:42.920
she is all I have.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.000
Where's the clothing?
Show me.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.120
How's it coming?

20:54.120 --> 20:56.000
Oh, you know,
bits and pieces.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.480
How's that?

20:57.480 --> 20:59.440
Well, three
different bullets...

20:59.440 --> 21:01.080
fired into three
different skulls.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.360
Randall Kaye ...

21:03.800 --> 21:04.680
His brother ...

21:05.720 --> 21:08.400
and our carjacking
victim, Jill Gormley.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.040
Bullets bounce
against bone...

21:10.040 --> 21:11.760
and you end up with three
pretty distorted bullets.

21:11.760 --> 21:14.200
Tell me you can still get a
match between all three.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.000
Oh, yeah.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.440
I just have to straighten
things out first.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.560
Hagen.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.920
Son of a bitch.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.000
Same gunshot wound?

21:29.040 --> 21:30.160
Where?

21:30.720 --> 21:31.960
I'll be right there.

21:32.680 --> 21:33.720
I got to go.
What? Wait.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.320
What same gunshot wound?
I got a call out.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.240
Is this about Hank Kerner?

21:40.040 --> 21:41.600
It looks like he got
another victim.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.360
Not the eyewitness,
our college girl?

21:47.200 --> 21:48.240
Worse.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.280
Oh, I can't believe
he went for Janet.

21:52.280 --> 21:53.320
Calleigh ...

21:53.320 --> 21:55.200
I want to be there when
you notify her family.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.720
Her parents are going
to be devastated.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.320
You shouldn't be
anywhere near this.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.760
If Kerner's bold enough
to go after the prosecutor...

22:00.760 --> 22:03.000
on his tourist trial, he's
going to come after the CSI.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.680
You should take
time off till this is over.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.840
With fugitives out there?

22:05.840 --> 22:07.160
I don't think so.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.760
I'm sure Horatio will
say the same thing.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.800
John, put the phone down.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.480
I have never so much
as taken a sick day,

22:11.480 --> 22:12.920
and I'm not about
to start now.

22:12.920 --> 22:13.960
Don't you get it?

22:13.960 --> 22:16.360
Kerner broke out to kill anyone
who could hurt him at trial.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.360
You're next, Calleigh.

22:17.360 --> 22:18.760
Well, then so be it,

22:18.760 --> 22:20.440
'cause I'm not leaving
the investigation.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.120
Hang on a second, Dan.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.880
Dan Clarkson,
fugitive team commander.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.600
Wants to
set up a debriefing.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.160
It's Calleigh.
Calleigh, what's up?

22:40.160 --> 22:42.960
Kerner got to
Janet Medrano.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.200
Yeah, state's attorney.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.400
The liver temp indicates
that the body is fresh,

22:48.400 --> 22:49.840
so he's less than
an hour out.

22:49.840 --> 22:52.760
I don't know if he's
on foot or on wheels,

22:52.760 --> 22:53.800
but, if you catch him now,

22:53.800 --> 22:55.280
the sand in his
shoes alone ...

22:55.280 --> 22:56.520
is enough to strap
him to the chair.

22:56.520 --> 22:57.360
Okay, here's what you do.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.520
Tell the fugitive team
to set up new checkpoints.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.180
And, Calleigh,
be careful of this guy Kerner.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.660
He plays for keeps.

23:02.660 --> 23:05.620
I'm taking all
necessary precautions.

23:06.460 --> 23:07.540
Hey, Butch,
thanks for coming.

23:07.540 --> 23:08.660
I need the best.

23:08.660 --> 23:10.420
She's ready to track ...

23:10.420 --> 23:11.660
if this rain holds.

23:11.660 --> 23:12.820
Here's her shirt.

23:12.820 --> 23:14.900
She's a
seven-year-old girl.

23:14.900 --> 23:17.060
Originated from this
point, butch, all right?

23:17.060 --> 23:18.260
Duchess will find her.

23:18.260 --> 23:20.300
I've read that dogs
smell with their tongues.

23:20.300 --> 23:22.300
Well, that's true.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.620
Most odor molecules ...

23:23.620 --> 23:25.740
are carried by mucus
through the nasal cavity

23:25.740 --> 23:28.500
to the convoluted
folds behind the nose.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.980
That's where
that molecule ...

23:29.980 --> 23:31.700
becomes a chemical
message to the brain.

23:32.340 --> 23:33.900
Here we go.
She's got a scent.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.500
You good to go?
Let's go.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.540
Let's track.

23:49.060 --> 23:49.940
All right, Eric.

23:49.940 --> 23:51.740
Hold traffic
and call for backup.

23:51.740 --> 23:53.380
Stewart must've
hailed a cab.

23:53.380 --> 23:54.860
With the new
venting systems,

23:54.860 --> 23:56.420
the dog can
follow a scent ...

23:56.420 --> 23:57.860
even if a person's
gotten in a car.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.220
Hey, you don't say a word
or I'll kill your mommy.

24:06.540 --> 24:08.620
Hi.
24th, please.

24:20.260 --> 24:22.300
You got anything?
She's got something.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.220
She's going to go.

24:23.220 --> 24:24.900
We need backup
here, now.

24:24.900 --> 24:27.180
Okay, there we go.
There she goes!

24:36.700 --> 24:37.940
What have we got, Butch?

24:39.420 --> 24:40.380
She's casting about.

24:40.380 --> 24:42.780
That means they stopped
here and the scent pooled.

24:42.780 --> 24:46.020
Okay, drop back.
You ready, Eric?

24:47.100 --> 24:48.140
Go wide.

25:16.380 --> 25:17.620
Hang on a second.

25:18.660 --> 25:20.380
Looks like a
school uniform.

25:22.460 --> 25:24.100
Probably purchased
clothes at the mall,

25:24.100 --> 25:26.020
and I'm guessing
they were boy's clothes.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.860
Yeah, and something
to cut her hair with.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.780
Just like Ruthie Crighton.

25:30.540 --> 25:33.100
It'll be just like Halloween.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.140
Your own neighbors
won't even know you.

25:35.540 --> 25:37.300
Come on,
we're a team.

25:38.340 --> 25:40.420
Come on.
Stop crying.

25:44.060 --> 25:45.340
Put out the word, Eric.

25:45.780 --> 25:47.500
He's traveling with a little boy.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.900
You're sure
Treynece is in there?

25:51.900 --> 25:53.660
Come on, Starsky.

25:53.660 --> 25:56.020
I admit to that, you
bag me up for pandering.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.100
You got it backwards.

25:57.100 --> 25:59.340
You don't help us confirm
she's with Hank Kerner,

25:59.340 --> 26:00.380
we grab you up.

26:00.380 --> 26:01.820
Does Treynece carry
a cell phone?

26:01.820 --> 26:02.900
What do I look
like to you, man,

26:02.900 --> 26:04.820
some low-budget
bougie operation?

26:04.820 --> 26:08.300
All my girls got cell phones,
beepers, PCs.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.180
I mean, it's the
third millennium, Chuck.

26:10.180 --> 26:11.500
Okay, Bill Gates,
call her.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.700
We need to make sure she's
in the room before we move.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.740
Yo.

26:18.740 --> 26:21.100
Delicious,
what's taking so long?

26:21.100 --> 26:22.700
You got my money?

26:25.860 --> 26:27.660
I didn't ask you what
the bald boy likes.

26:27.660 --> 26:29.380
I asked you, do
you got the money?

26:29.820 --> 26:31.460
Well, count it twice.
I'm bouncing.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.300
Yo.

26:34.340 --> 26:35.660
She's in there ...

26:35.940 --> 26:36.820
with Kerner.

26:36.820 --> 26:37.700
All right.

26:37.700 --> 26:38.940
Step back out of
the way, please.

26:39.620 --> 26:40.660
Detective?

26:40.940 --> 26:41.860
I didn't get a call.

26:41.860 --> 26:44.700
I had to hear from dispatch
you located Kerner's associate.

26:44.700 --> 26:45.820
A lead just came in.

26:45.820 --> 26:47.740
This is our investigation.
Don't run it without me.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.460
Yo, Chuck.
Look like you got...

26:49.460 --> 26:50.900
some management
problems of your own, pimp.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.940
I asked you to step back
out of the way, all right?

26:52.940 --> 26:54.620
My bad, my bad.

27:11.580 --> 27:13.500
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

27:16.300 --> 27:17.700
Bathroom clear.

27:19.340 --> 27:20.860
He's out the back.
We have no visual.

27:20.860 --> 27:21.700
Get the choppers in the air.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.500
Coordinate with
patrol on the ground.

27:25.380 --> 27:26.940
Where'd he go?
He didn't pay me.

27:26.940 --> 27:28.500
Cheap-ass
bald bastard.

27:28.500 --> 27:29.660
Where did Hank go?

27:29.660 --> 27:31.740
Pop a cap in
some bitch cop.

27:31.740 --> 27:33.740
Blond bitch.

27:36.780 --> 27:37.900
Uh, Britney ...

27:39.180 --> 27:40.740
better check this out.

27:44.700 --> 27:45.820
31.

27:45.820 --> 27:46.940
Homicide.

27:47.220 --> 27:48.260
A direct threat to you.

27:48.940 --> 27:51.220
Yeah.
It's also a gift.

27:51.220 --> 27:52.780
It's trace evidence.

27:53.180 --> 27:55.380
Hank Kerner left
us his calling card.

27:59.340 --> 28:00.660
So let me get this straight.

28:00.660 --> 28:03.860
The first time you and
your husband discussed it?

28:03.860 --> 28:05.660
It was during
a jail visit.

28:06.580 --> 28:08.700
Randall said a
convict had...

28:08.700 --> 28:10.660
approached him
about escaping.

28:10.660 --> 28:12.980
He wouldn't tell me who he
was or what he had done.

28:12.980 --> 28:14.380
I should've asked.

28:14.380 --> 28:15.540
Okay, keep going.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.100
You know more than
you think you do.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.580
I told Randall's brother
what the plan was.

28:21.580 --> 28:24.220
Bryce, right?
Bryce the pilot. Yeah.

28:24.220 --> 28:26.100
He would've done
anything for his big brother.

28:28.300 --> 28:30.700
I called an offshore account
in the morning to wire the ...

28:32.780 --> 28:33.820
wait, um ...

28:33.820 --> 28:36.980
I remember one of the
men asked for an RV.

28:38.580 --> 28:39.580
Randall ...

28:40.620 --> 28:42.820
didn't want me to be
tied up purchasing one,

28:42.820 --> 28:45.740
so he decided to pay
them both cash.

28:45.740 --> 28:48.300
They agreed on
$50,000 a piece,

28:48.580 --> 28:52.260
which Bryce brought
over on the helicopter.

28:53.300 --> 28:55.820
I don't know which
one asked for the RV.

28:55.820 --> 28:57.100
Yeah, Stewart.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.260
Stewart asked for the RV.

28:58.660 --> 29:00.100
The man who took Emma?

29:00.100 --> 29:01.220
That's correct.

29:01.220 --> 29:02.340
How do you know?

29:02.740 --> 29:04.780
It doesn't really
matter right now.

29:05.860 --> 29:08.380
It's a mobile apartment.
He could take her anywhere.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.420
Contact every RV
dealership in Miami.

29:10.420 --> 29:12.460
Find out if a single man bought
one in the last 24 hours?

29:12.460 --> 29:13.420
No, rent.

29:13.420 --> 29:14.820
He has to
conserve his cash.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.180
Simon Bishop.

29:17.940 --> 29:18.660
Yes.

29:18.660 --> 29:19.940
Where's your RV?

29:19.940 --> 29:20.900
What RV?

29:20.900 --> 29:22.580
You were the only one
insured to drive.

29:23.620 --> 29:24.700
Dealer's statement.

29:25.540 --> 29:26.780
Could we come in?

29:27.100 --> 29:28.140
Sure.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.900
Kids' soccer, huh?

29:34.540 --> 29:37.220
I also coach local boys'
basketball and cross-country.

29:37.220 --> 29:40.340
It says that you are the
coach of the year, Simon.

29:42.620 --> 29:44.140
Where's your RV?

29:45.180 --> 29:48.060
The RV.
I lent it to a friend.

29:48.060 --> 29:50.420
Who?
Him?

29:50.700 --> 29:52.500
Stewart Odett.
I met him on-line.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.540
Chat room.
Stewart Otis.

29:54.540 --> 29:57.380
He is a convicted child
molester and child killer.

29:57.380 --> 29:58.300
Did you know that?

29:58.300 --> 30:00.300
He was about to get
sentenced to death.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.700
When he
broke out of prison.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.700
He was traveling ...

30:05.780 --> 30:09.620
traveling with a little girl
disguised as a little boy.

30:09.620 --> 30:10.420
He was alone.

30:10.420 --> 30:11.700
He asked me to rent the RV.

30:11.700 --> 30:12.780
I met him at the curb ...

30:12.780 --> 30:15.900
Since when does chinese
food come with a kid's meal?

30:15.900 --> 30:16.940
Try again.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.980
He said her name
used to be Emma.

30:26.980 --> 30:28.060
He didn't tell me
her new name.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.140
I haven't seen
them since.

30:29.140 --> 30:30.140
I don't know where
they went.

30:30.140 --> 30:32.780
So you short eyes don't
do each other favors?

30:33.180 --> 30:34.580
Short eyes?

30:35.620 --> 30:36.940
I don't molest children.

30:36.940 --> 30:39.620
What did he trade
for use of the RV?

30:39.620 --> 30:40.740
Nothing.

30:41.060 --> 30:42.100
Nothing.

30:42.780 --> 30:43.700
You're insulting me.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.220
You're the one insulting.

30:45.580 --> 30:47.420
Emotional intimacy
doesn't come ...

30:47.420 --> 30:48.860
with a predetermined
age range.

30:48.860 --> 30:50.780
I merely challenge
the accepted view ...

30:50.780 --> 30:52.220
that children are
non-sexual.

30:52.220 --> 30:53.540
What about the
accepted view...

30:53.540 --> 30:57.180
that exploiting a child in
any way is a felony?

30:58.220 --> 31:00.220
So what do you got, Simon?

31:02.100 --> 31:03.220
Let's go.

31:05.580 --> 31:07.260
Photos.
Where.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.420
He offered,
I accepted.

31:12.060 --> 31:16.020
He said he took them their
first few hours together.

31:17.420 --> 31:18.420
Well, there you go.

31:19.140 --> 31:20.180
Simon Bishop,

31:20.180 --> 31:22.740
you're under arrest for
possession of child pornography.

31:22.740 --> 31:24.220
But they're not my photos.

31:25.060 --> 31:26.500
She's not even my type.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.140
You better hope
she's still alive.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.460
Hey.

32:40.940 --> 32:42.740
Oh, you.

32:43.380 --> 32:44.380
Got anything?

32:44.380 --> 32:46.580
Yeah, petroleum
and graphite.

32:46.580 --> 32:47.780
Gun lubricant.

32:47.780 --> 32:48.780
Yeah, but it's old school.

32:48.780 --> 32:51.260
Most modern-day
lubricants have teflon.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.900
Can you pin down
the brand?

32:52.900 --> 32:54.340
No, but I'm going
to take it to Claudia.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.380
She probably can.

32:55.380 --> 32:57.420
Why? Are you going
to follow me there, too?

32:58.260 --> 32:59.460
You sure you're okay?

33:00.300 --> 33:01.180
You know, Hagen,

33:01.180 --> 33:03.980
not only did I graduate from
the same academy as you,

33:03.980 --> 33:06.180
but I'm a southern
woman and all that implies,

33:06.180 --> 33:07.460
and I don't know
why you have ...

33:07.460 --> 33:10.220
so little confidence in my
ability to protect myself.

33:10.220 --> 33:11.140
It's not that.

33:11.140 --> 33:12.300
Well, then what?

33:17.460 --> 33:19.500
My first partner,
Ray Caine,

33:19.500 --> 33:20.940
when we worked narco,

33:21.380 --> 33:22.900
when he got killed
on the job.

33:24.980 --> 33:27.780
I lose two partners,
I got a rep.

33:27.780 --> 33:29.460
Ah, snakebit.

33:29.460 --> 33:31.060
People get afraid
to team up with you.

33:31.580 --> 33:33.180
I've seen it bounce
guys off the force.

33:33.180 --> 33:35.620
So this is more out of
concern for your career...

33:35.620 --> 33:37.340
than it is for my safety.

33:37.340 --> 33:38.260
Yeah.

33:40.340 --> 33:41.900
Will you stay with
Speedle tonight?

33:42.700 --> 33:43.620
Or Delko?

33:43.620 --> 33:45.100
Actually, I'm going
to stay here.

33:45.100 --> 33:46.340
Then I'm going
to stay with you.

33:51.460 --> 33:52.540
Okay.

33:52.900 --> 33:55.220
Well, as long as we're
clear you're doing it for you,

33:55.220 --> 33:56.260
not for me.

33:57.060 --> 33:58.180
Crystal clear.

33:58.620 --> 33:59.980
So what does Simon say?

34:00.300 --> 34:01.660
It's all in the pixels.

34:01.660 --> 34:04.140
Take a look at the
portable tv in the corner.

34:04.580 --> 34:05.820
See anyone you know?

34:07.500 --> 34:08.980
Hello, Simon.

34:08.980 --> 34:10.820
He was there when
this picture was taken.

34:10.820 --> 34:13.020
Yes, but it doesn't tell us
where it was taken.

34:13.020 --> 34:14.580
It's not a house,
it's an RV,

34:14.580 --> 34:16.340
so they could have
driven it anywhere.

34:16.340 --> 34:17.860
Okay, what about
reference points?

34:17.860 --> 34:19.659
Stewart tacked
a sheet...

34:19.659 --> 34:21.420
over the window
to disguise the location.

34:22.139 --> 34:24.420
All right, so let's
go to the last picture.

34:27.500 --> 34:28.820
The light's changed.

34:29.540 --> 34:30.699
All right.

34:31.179 --> 34:32.460
When the sun moves,

34:32.460 --> 34:34.340
it highlights the
background, doesn't it?

34:34.739 --> 34:35.860
I'll go close
on the window.

34:35.860 --> 34:37.260
Okay, grid it.

34:38.300 --> 34:40.659
Look, uh, looks
like a mountain.

34:40.659 --> 34:43.699
Yes, but we both know
Miami has no mountains.

34:43.699 --> 34:45.540
And those don't
look like trees, either.

34:45.540 --> 34:47.580
Maybe the geographic
information ...

34:47.580 --> 34:48.739
system can
recognize it.

34:50.139 --> 34:52.580
It calculates the ratio
between peaks

34:52.580 --> 34:55.300
and then compares that to a
database of similar ratios...

34:55.300 --> 34:57.980
from Miami's buildings
and landscapes.

35:06.340 --> 35:07.740
It's the orange bowl.

35:08.460 --> 35:09.540
Yeah.

35:15.500 --> 35:18.740
The orange bowl has five
thousand parking spots.

35:18.740 --> 35:20.180
All we need is one,
though.

35:20.540 --> 35:23.340
I can calculate the movement
of the sun to figure out...

35:23.340 --> 35:24.740
where Stewart
was parked.

35:24.740 --> 35:26.500
But that's going
to take a few hours.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.940
Let's see if our friend
Simon can help us with that.

35:31.180 --> 35:32.260
Where are they, Simon?

35:32.260 --> 35:33.420
Where's the RV?

35:33.420 --> 35:34.500
You don't have
to be so physical.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.420
You don't know
what physical is.

35:35.420 --> 35:36.260
Where are they?

35:36.260 --> 35:37.940
This is it.
This is where he parked.

35:38.380 --> 35:40.060
Well, they're not
here, are they?

35:43.980 --> 35:45.020
They're not here.

35:56.860 --> 35:58.300
Smells chemical.

35:58.300 --> 35:59.980
Dealer said the
RV needed repairs.

35:59.980 --> 36:01.580
Could be from the
waste tank.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.780
Big tank,
little leak, right?

36:05.820 --> 36:07.460
Let's follow
the bread crumbs.

36:08.060 --> 36:09.540
We just caught a break.

36:41.980 --> 36:43.020
Somebody's home.

36:49.180 --> 36:50.500
On my count.

36:51.540 --> 36:54.660
Three, two ...

36:55.060 --> 36:57.540
Miami-Dade police!
Get down!

36:58.180 --> 36:59.660
A doggy maybe?
Yeah.

36:59.660 --> 37:00.820
Clear.

37:03.260 --> 37:06.380
Is it a little boy doggy
or a little girl doggy?

37:07.060 --> 37:08.140
Little girl.

37:09.940 --> 37:11.180
And what's her name?

37:12.220 --> 37:13.540
Her name is beetle,

37:14.180 --> 37:17.300
'cause she's super
small like a bug.

37:21.060 --> 37:23.140
Show me how you
pet the doggy.

37:27.020 --> 37:27.980
Oh ...

37:27.980 --> 37:29.020
That's very nice.

37:29.020 --> 37:31.140
Blood.
Damn it!

37:31.700 --> 37:32.660
Thank you.

37:32.660 --> 37:33.980
Son of a bitch.

37:34.700 --> 37:36.780
I found something
outside, too.

37:36.780 --> 37:37.580
Okay.

37:37.580 --> 37:38.780
Thank you.

37:39.820 --> 37:42.020
I want you to do one
more thing, okay?

37:43.100 --> 37:45.780
I want you to say
good-bye to Horatio.

37:55.340 --> 37:59.300
Okay, Stewart, okay.

37:59.300 --> 38:00.580
Let's go.

38:04.580 --> 38:06.060
What do you got?
Footsteps.

38:09.300 --> 38:10.380
That's a drag mark.

38:10.900 --> 38:12.020
From a body?

38:12.020 --> 38:14.020
Nope.
It's from a shovel.

38:15.260 --> 38:16.860
No!
Help me!

38:16.860 --> 38:17.900
Come on!

38:22.300 --> 38:23.300
No!

38:25.580 --> 38:26.820
He's going to bury her.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.400
No.
Oh, no.

39:46.800 --> 39:47.800
Emma?

39:49.680 --> 39:50.720
Emma?!

39:55.040 --> 39:56.680
Emma?
Emma?!

39:58.040 --> 39:59.000
She's alive!

40:00.360 --> 40:01.400
She's alive!

40:23.960 --> 40:27.080
Calleigh?
Calleigh?!

40:31.160 --> 40:33.080
Calleigh Duquesne,
have you seen her?

40:33.080 --> 40:34.560
She came in about
an hour ago.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.280
What did she want?

40:35.280 --> 40:37.040
Results on that substance
she recovered.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.600
The gun slick brand.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.680
Where'd she go?

40:40.080 --> 40:40.840
I don't know.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.920
She took off like a
bat out of hell.

40:46.520 --> 40:47.760
Excuse me.

40:47.760 --> 40:50.240
I was wondering if
y'all carry a particular ...

40:50.240 --> 40:51.440
brand of gun
lubricant in your store.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.120
It's called A-1 Dependable.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.600
No.
Really?

40:54.600 --> 40:56.880
Now, that's funny, 'cause
it's this old-school lubricant...

40:56.880 --> 40:59.560
that my daddy used to use
and I distinctly remember...

40:59.560 --> 41:02.480
y'all being the only store in
Miami that carried that brand.

41:02.480 --> 41:03.800
You remembered wrong.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.480
Okay, let's try this again.

41:08.520 --> 41:12.720
I need to know if you sold
gun lubricant to this man.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.320
I don't know.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.480
Now, that's too bad,

41:22.480 --> 41:24.200
'cause now I'm going to
have to come back...

41:24.200 --> 41:25.760
with an ATF agent and shut
you down for a couple days,

41:25.760 --> 41:27.880
and I guarantee you you're
going to remember that.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.520
Please, I don't want
to get in any trouble.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.440
Why don't you just
tell me what aisle it's on?

41:36.480 --> 41:37.520
Four.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.560
Drop the gun.
Get down on the floor.

42:41.640 --> 42:42.840
There are two ways
this goes down.

42:42.840 --> 42:44.600
Either way,
you're dropping the gun.

42:45.200 --> 42:47.240
If I give up now,
I go to the chair.

42:47.880 --> 42:50.680
Ten years of appeals,
or you can go right now.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.240
How does it feel?

43:10.360 --> 43:11.400
You can take him
up to booking.

43:11.400 --> 43:12.480
I'll do the paperwork.
Yes, ma'am.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.000
This ain't over, bitch.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.800
I'll be seeing you.

43:17.040 --> 43:18.480
Well, you know what
the thing is, Hank?

43:18.480 --> 43:20.760
It doesn't really matter
if you do because,

43:20.760 --> 43:23.040
even if you get rid of me,
someone will step in my place.

43:23.040 --> 43:25.240
And, if you silence me,
the evidence has its own voice,

43:25.240 --> 43:29.200
and it keeps saying,
over and over, you.

43:29.560 --> 43:30.760
You and your bullets.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.280
You know what? And,
by the way, where you're going ...

43:34.280 --> 43:36.000
I think you're going
to be the bitch.

43:42.360 --> 43:43.520
Calleigh.

43:44.040 --> 43:45.280
Where have you been?

43:45.280 --> 43:46.600
I took a drive ...

43:47.240 --> 43:48.600
got some fresh air ...

43:49.440 --> 43:51.960
I apprehended
an escaped felon.

44:01.160 --> 44:01.920
Hi.
Hi.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.800
You feeling better?

44:07.680 --> 44:08.680
Yeah.

44:08.680 --> 44:09.600
That's good.

44:09.600 --> 44:11.640
Would you like
some water or ...

44:11.640 --> 44:12.800
something to drink?

44:13.240 --> 44:14.760
No, thank you.
Okay.

44:14.760 --> 44:17.240
A nurse is on her way in
to see you in a few minutes,

44:17.240 --> 44:19.000
but I was hoping I
could ask you...

44:19.000 --> 44:20.400
a few questions before
she comes in.

44:20.400 --> 44:21.680
Would that be okay?

44:21.680 --> 44:22.640
Yeah.

44:22.640 --> 44:23.640
All right.

44:23.640 --> 44:25.040
You're my policeman.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.440
That's right.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.200
Here's what I want
to ask you.

44:30.200 --> 44:34.360
I was looking for you
before I found you.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.080
Does that make sense?

44:39.360 --> 44:41.920
I know.
He told me.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.160
The man who took
you from school.

44:46.240 --> 44:48.480
He told me he was a jail man.

44:49.080 --> 44:50.640
And you know what?
He was.

44:51.560 --> 44:52.760
He was in jail.

44:55.480 --> 44:58.720
If he could get out of jail,
could he get in here?

44:58.720 --> 44:59.800
No.

45:00.120 --> 45:01.680
I wouldn't let him in here.

45:03.280 --> 45:05.360
Okay?
I won't let him do that.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.680
My mom told me
that sometimes ...

45:09.120 --> 45:11.400
they put good
people in jail.

45:11.400 --> 45:12.560
Like daddy.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.840
But I don't think that man
was a good man.

45:17.520 --> 45:19.000
He hurt my neck.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.320
I know.

45:21.360 --> 45:22.800
I know he did.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.000
I know he hurt you,

45:24.000 --> 45:25.120
and that's why I want
to get him.

45:25.120 --> 45:27.880
I don't want to let him
do this to any other kids.

45:28.720 --> 45:29.760
Now, Emma ...

45:30.600 --> 45:32.640
He said my name
wasn't Emma.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.480
He gave me a new name.

45:35.840 --> 45:37.440
He gave you a
new name.

45:38.480 --> 45:39.640
Is it Robyn?

45:40.120 --> 45:41.360
Is that the new name?

45:42.040 --> 45:44.000
He said my name
was Bobbie.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.320
So who's Robyn?

45:45.720 --> 45:46.800
My cousin.

45:47.600 --> 45:48.640
She's six.

45:50.760 --> 45:51.920
She's six.

45:53.720 --> 45:54.680
Okay.

45:54.680 --> 45:56.800
Let me ask you one
more question.

45:56.800 --> 45:57.840
All right?

45:58.640 --> 46:00.160
Do you remember ...

46:00.160 --> 46:03.280
if you gave this
man Robyn's address?

46:03.280 --> 46:04.520
No.

46:05.040 --> 46:06.120
But ...

46:06.960 --> 46:08.760
would I be in trouble...

46:08.760 --> 46:11.680
if I told him where
she went to school?

46:13.120 --> 46:15.800
No.
You'd be fine.

46:16.640 --> 46:17.640
Okay?

46:17.920 --> 46:19.400
The nurse will be right in.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.040
I've located Robyn Kaye.

46:24.040 --> 46:25.480
She's on a field trip
at the aquarium.

46:25.480 --> 46:27.040
Notify the fugitive team.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.840
We're moving
into position.

46:29.840 --> 46:32.040
Okay, keep your eyes
open for a man in uniform,

46:32.040 --> 46:34.640
an employee, a vendor,
or maybe a guard.

46:34.640 --> 46:35.680
Roger that.

47:30.200 --> 47:31.360
Mommy!
Mommy!

47:31.360 --> 47:33.800
Suspect is on the move,
heading toward the south exit.

47:49.720 --> 47:51.800
Mommy!
Mommy!

48:02.520 --> 48:04.240
There's no way out,
Stewart.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.920
Let her go.

48:09.960 --> 48:11.440
I'll kill her, Horatio.

48:13.120 --> 48:16.040
Stewart, I'm not going
to ask you again.

48:16.600 --> 48:17.760
Let her go.

48:20.880 --> 48:22.040
I love them.

48:24.640 --> 48:26.120
I can't do without them.

48:27.200 --> 48:30.320
Stewart,
that's not her fault.

48:35.440 --> 48:37.360
Stewart.
Stewart!

48:43.440 --> 48:45.280
Are you okay, Robyn?
You sure?

48:45.280 --> 48:46.600
Okay, here's what
I want you to do.

48:46.600 --> 48:48.880
I want you to run that
way as fast as you can.

48:48.880 --> 48:50.280
Go ahead.
Run.

48:51.120 --> 48:52.160
Run, Robyn.

49:03.880 --> 49:05.040
Give me your
other hand, Stewart.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.040
Let me go.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.640
I wish I could.

49:09.680 --> 49:11.160
I'll just get another one.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.520
Give me your other
hand, Stewart.

49:12.520 --> 49:13.920
Come on, give it to me.

49:13.920 --> 49:15.600
Let me go.
Come on.

49:33.680 --> 49:35.720
Why didn't you
let me die?

49:36.320 --> 49:38.120
Because you died
a long time ago, Stewart.

49:38.120 --> 49:39.280
Let's go.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.040
Stewart Otis,

49:40.040 --> 49:41.200
you're under arrest for ...

49:41.200 --> 49:42.640
the attempted
murder of Emma Kaye.

49:42.640 --> 49:45.760
No.
I will get out.

49:46.800 --> 49:47.920
It's my nature.

49:48.280 --> 49:49.360
And I'll be waiting.

49:50.280 --> 49:51.400
That's my nature.

49:51.880 --> 49:53.000
Take him.

49:55.840 --> 49:57.080
Hey, you're bleeding.

49:57.360 --> 49:58.160
Oh.

49:58.160 --> 49:59.200
Hold on.

50:03.760 --> 50:04.920
I'm fine.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.160
I can see that.

50:09.200 --> 50:10.240
Thank you.

50:14.960 --> 50:16.920
Well, everything
in its own time.

50:16.920 --> 50:19.200
Yes, aren't those
words to live by?

50:19.200 --> 50:20.560
Will I see you at the booking?

50:22.880 --> 50:23.920
Yeah.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.320
Maybe you will.

50:25.320 --> 50:26.720
Okay.
Yelina.

50:27.760 --> 50:28.800
Nice job.
