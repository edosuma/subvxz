00:01.440 --> 00:05.030
Miley, unless you want to do
sound check in front of an audience,

00:05.080 --> 00:08.150
you best make like a cow and move!

00:11.320 --> 00:13.200
What the heck takes you girls so long?

00:13.240 --> 00:14.270
Wig.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.960
-Makeup.
-Wardrobe.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.590
-Bling.
-Bling.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.870
And then you hate it,
and got to start all over again.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.560
Good. You guys are still here.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.590
Yeah, and trying hard not to be,

00:25.640 --> 00:28.110
so whatever it is you're here for,
make it quick.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.120
We don't have time
for another bling crisis.

00:32.439 --> 00:35.110
Well, l was just coming
to wish Miley luck at the concert,

00:35.160 --> 00:38.390
which l won't be going to, again.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.270
Oliver, you know if you want a ticket,
all you have to do is ask me.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.670
Great. Can l have three,
one for me and my two best friends?

00:45.960 --> 00:48.270
Wait a minute, they'll already be there.

00:48.320 --> 00:51.950
Backstage, where l wasn't invited,
again.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.950
Dang it, Oliver,
this is my favourite outfit,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.560
and now you're getting guilt all over it.

00:57.600 --> 01:02.310
Don't worry, we'll open the windows
in the limo, and it will blow right off.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.360
-Let's go.
-Sure, make jokes.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.390
l'll go home
and laugh at them alone, again.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.790
-Well...
-Miley, conference!

01:16.760 --> 01:19.400
You're not actually thinking about this,
are you?

01:19.440 --> 01:22.590
Well, he's never been backstage
to anything.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.750
l know this is kind of our special thing,
and you might be kind of jealous...

01:29.800 --> 01:31.070
Jealous?

01:32.360 --> 01:35.710
l... l am not jealous.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.320
Yes, you are.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.310
l am not talking to you.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.790
Look, l just don't want you
to be embarrassed, okay?

01:42.840 --> 01:45.070
And let's face it,
he's just not as sophisticated

01:45.120 --> 01:48.110
as Lola Luftnagle,
international jetsetter.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.070
And l'm embarrassing?

01:54.120 --> 01:55.520
Fine, you're in.

01:55.560 --> 01:56.790
What?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.800
l meant to do that.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.000
<i>Hey, yea</i> h

02:04.040 --> 02:06.070
<i>Make some noise, make some nois</i> e

02:06.120 --> 02:07.680
<i>Make some nois</i> e

02:07.720 --> 02:10.520
<i>Hey, he</i> y

02:10.560 --> 02:12.310
<i>Make some nois</i> e

02:12.360 --> 02:15.670
<i>Hey, hey, yea</i> h

02:22.320 --> 02:23.750
Hey, has Oliver gotten here yet?

02:23.800 --> 02:27.710
No. He texted me he's having a little
trouble putting together a disguise.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.110
This ought to be good.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.590
Will you relax?
l'm sure everything's gonna be fine.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.440
Good evening.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.920
Let's pump some blood into this party!

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:37.120 --> 03:39.470
A vampire? Really?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.990
Was your wolfman costume
in the cleaners?

03:42.040 --> 03:44.760
Will you relax?
l'm sure everything's gonna be fine.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.750
Stop enjoying this!

03:46.800 --> 03:48.990
Hey, this is the best l could do
on short notice.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.790
And if l was invited earlier,
l would've had time to...

03:51.840 --> 03:54.640
-Grow some fangs?
-l forgot.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.270
-Fix him!
-Why can't you fix him?

04:01.320 --> 04:03.510
<i>Once again</i>,
<i>give it up for Hannah Montana</i>!

04:03.560 --> 04:05.870
l'm a little busy right now.

04:07.800 --> 04:11.000
<i>Thank you! l love you, too</i>.
<i>Good night, everybody</i>!

04:13.400 --> 04:16.120
So, where's Count Dorkula?

04:16.640 --> 04:21.950
Well, thanks to your brilliant friend,
Lola, Count Dorkula is no more-kula.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.760
<i>Yo, l'm hanging with Hanna</i> h
<i>'cause l'm more than just a fan-na</i> h

04:25.800 --> 04:28.230
<i>With her posse, l can mes</i> h

04:28.280 --> 04:29.550
<i>Wor</i> d

04:30.200 --> 04:34.190
You couldn't have found a costume
that covered his mouth?

04:34.240 --> 04:37.310
What is that beard made of anyway?
Armpit hair?

04:39.120 --> 04:41.510
You said nobody could tell.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.200
Well, you're lucky l found this.

04:43.240 --> 04:47.200
And by the way, l kind of promised
your stage manager a raise.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.550
lt's all good, Dougie D.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.200
This is awesome! Thank you so much.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.040
Watching from backstage was so...

04:57.080 --> 05:00.120
lf you say ''fricky-fricky fun,''
you're going home.

05:00.160 --> 05:03.070
Sorry. l didn't get the rule book.

05:03.120 --> 05:07.430
Okay, well, Hannah backstage rule
number one, be calm.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.990
Be cool. Be...

05:11.280 --> 05:13.920
-Anything but that.
-Look! Look!

05:15.240 --> 05:18.670
-lt's Guillermo Montoya!
-He is so cute!

05:20.880 --> 05:22.230
You are such girls.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.870
He's the number one tennis player
in the world,

05:23.920 --> 05:26.640
and all you care about
is how cute he is.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.630
Yeah, what's your point?

05:28.680 --> 05:32.830
Hannah Montana. Guillermo Montoya.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.950
You don't have to tell me.
l know who you are.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.990
l know you know, but l like saying it.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.950
Montana, Montoya, Montana, Montoya.
You try it. lt's fun.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.800
-Montana, Montoya, Montana...
-Montana, Montoya, Montana...

05:42.840 --> 05:44.240
Not you!

05:45.000 --> 05:47.750
Who are your colourful friends?

05:49.040 --> 05:52.430
Well, Guillermo, this is Lola Luftnagle.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.350
You can call me Gui.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.800
v ery smooth.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.070
And, Gui, this is my friend...

06:04.200 --> 06:05.680
Mike Stand.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.030
Mike. Stand. Lee.

06:10.480 --> 06:13.390
Mike Standly, the third.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.080
And hopefully, the last.

06:17.120 --> 06:21.000
Hey, l'm staying, and l'm playing
till my hair starts a-greying.

06:21.040 --> 06:25.400
My friends. Aren't they something?

06:26.320 --> 06:28.830
Colourful. Strange.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.670
l love them!
And l loved you on stage tonight.

06:34.600 --> 06:38.030
You were like me on the tennis court.
A tiger.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.240
Excuse me.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.830
-He thinks l'm a tiger.
-He thinks l'm colourful!

06:48.360 --> 06:51.030
That just leaves strange for you, Mikey.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.560
Doesn't sound good.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.710
Even with that adorable accent.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.710
ls everything okay?

07:08.760 --> 07:13.880
My celebrity partner for this pro-am
sprained her thumb speed-texting.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.230
Well, l just so happen to know
a celebrity with a wicked serve

07:18.280 --> 07:20.310
and a very cute tennis outfit.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.550
You're kidding!

07:21.600 --> 07:25.590
Hannah, if you can play,
you're my new partner.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.590
Well, then get ready to rally,

07:27.640 --> 07:32.030
'cause you're looking at the girl
that put the tennis in Tennessee!

07:32.080 --> 07:33.480
Fantastic!

07:35.480 --> 07:37.150
You don't play tennis.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.080
And l don't skydive, either,

07:39.120 --> 07:42.910
but, honey, l'd jump out of a plane
with that boy any day.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.550
Excuse me,
l'm very thirsty and l've lost my purse.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.190
Wow, sounds like you have a problem.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.150
That's good.

07:59.800 --> 08:04.430
Please, l can't pay, but l'll gladly
tell your fortune for a water.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.720
l already have a fortune. Why?

08:07.760 --> 08:10.270
Because l don't give away stuff for free.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.790
You are an evil little boy.

08:13.840 --> 08:18.590
Because your heart is cold,
terrible things will happen to you.

08:19.160 --> 08:24.150
Until you learn to be nice,
you are cursed!

08:27.160 --> 08:28.310
What was that all about?

08:28.360 --> 08:33.880
Some scam artist tried to work me
for a free water. Now l'm cursed.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.670
That was a coincidence.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.640
Wow. How about them apples?

09:15.120 --> 09:17.630
What in the Sam heck are you doing?

09:17.680 --> 09:22.150
l'm practising my grunt. All great
tennis players have a signature grunt.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.550
Well, you sound like Uncle Earl
doing his annual sit-up.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.200
''Well, that ought to do it for this year.''

09:34.760 --> 09:38.110
Daddy, come on.
l can't help it if l'm pumped.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.870
l am gonna be serving it up
with the cutest guy in tennis!

09:42.760 --> 09:44.870
And it's all for charity.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.190
Yeah, l was getting to that.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.070
By the way,
the people from the tournament called,

09:50.120 --> 09:52.350
they can only get you one ticket.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.230
One ticket?

09:54.280 --> 09:57.400
Now l've got to choose
between Lilly and Oliver.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.390
This ought to be fun.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.350
lt won't be no problem, honey.
Just tell them the truth.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.230
They're your friends.
They'll understand.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.030
-She's taking me! Tell him!
-She's taking me! Tell her!

10:10.080 --> 10:11.670
Way to go, Dad.

10:12.920 --> 10:17.550
Now, honey, l said they'd understand.
l didn't say they'd be happy about it.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.870
-l'm going!
-No, l'm going!

10:19.920 --> 10:21.910
-Miley!
-Miley!

10:21.960 --> 10:26.030
Hey, look on the bright side,
l think you found your tennis grunt.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.390
Can l have another napkin, please?

10:34.440 --> 10:38.270
One per cone! You got a problem
with that? Use your shirt!

10:39.400 --> 10:41.960
-You're mean!
-You're mean.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.280
Caterpillar!

10:47.360 --> 10:49.160
l almost ate that!

10:51.200 --> 10:53.590
You know,
l accidentally ate a caterpillar once.

10:53.640 --> 10:56.200
Week later, burped up a butterfly.

10:57.840 --> 11:01.590
This isn't funny.
Flying caramel apples, caterpillars...

11:01.640 --> 11:03.830
That embarrassing oil stain
on the back of your pants.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.070
What?

11:08.240 --> 11:11.280
l've been cursed!
Jackson, you've got to help me!

11:11.320 --> 11:13.310
How? The fortuneteller said
that you were cursed

11:13.360 --> 11:14.760
until you learned how to be nice.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.150
And l think we both know
that's never gonna happen.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.270
Yes, it is!

11:29.760 --> 11:32.350
There you go, sweetie. All better.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.000
Yes! lt worked!

11:37.920 --> 11:41.230
l've got to go tell Grandma
where l hid her teeth.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.950
Bravo. Bravo. You were all brilliant.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.150
And worth every penny.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.950
Hey, Jackson.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.830
-Can't wait for our date on Saturday.
-Me, too, Steph.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.870
You did all of this
just to get one Saturday off?

11:57.920 --> 11:59.110
Of course not.

11:59.160 --> 12:02.070
Hey, Jackson.
l'll see you next Saturday.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.070
l did it for all the Saturdays.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.870
So, what are you doing in two weeks?

12:10.760 --> 12:13.560
l don't see me in your future.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.600
You will kiss me or you will be cursed.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.400
Heads, l take Oliver. Tails, l take Lilly.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.950
Come on!

12:32.880 --> 12:35.070
-Stop pushing! Get out of my way!
-Move out of my way.

12:35.120 --> 12:39.240
Hey! Hey, Miley, l made you a cake!
Look, it has hearts on it.

12:41.480 --> 12:45.470
Real subtle!
Buttering her up with cake with hearts!

12:45.520 --> 12:46.870
Pathetic.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.720
Hey, Miley, l made you a shirt!

12:52.680 --> 12:55.480
-She's taking me!
-She's taking me!

12:55.520 --> 12:56.670
Keep this up,

12:56.720 --> 13:00.190
and neither of you are going
to the tennis tournament tomorrow!

13:00.240 --> 13:03.440
Are you guys talking about
the celebrity pro-am this weekend?

13:03.480 --> 13:05.360
Not now, Rico.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.960
Because l have a ticket l'm not using.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.640
l said not...

13:10.600 --> 13:12.990
Teenie-weenie meanie say what?

13:13.520 --> 13:17.880
-You can have it if you want.
-What's the catch?

13:18.440 --> 13:23.030
No catch. l'm going to be spending
the day petting homeless cats.

Guillermo Montoya never loses!

14:53.000 --> 14:55.590
-Never!
-Never?

14:55.640 --> 14:59.110
Not even in a little charity game?
You know, for fun?

15:00.320 --> 15:03.750
Fun is for losers!
l'll take care of Roddick.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.790
You make Dakota cry more
than she did in that pig movie.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.760
Hi, Dakota!

15:12.240 --> 15:14.070
Aim for her head.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.110
l'm not gonna aim for her...

15:17.160 --> 15:18.190
Okay.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.430
Switch seats with me!

15:23.840 --> 15:27.470
-Gee, let me think. No.
-But it's not fair.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.950
You're lucky you're even here in the
first place. Now, stop talking to me.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.710
<i>lf you two are finished..</i>.
<i>First service, Hannah Montana</i>.

15:43.040 --> 15:47.430
<i>Hey, cutie with the tomato head</i>,
<i>turn off the cell phone</i>.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.960
Sorry. Forgot to put it on vibrate.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.270
-Hello?
-Switch seats with me.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.840
You're pathetic.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.230
Switch seats with me.
Switch seats with me.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.270
Switch seats with me.
Switch seats with me.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.880
Knock it off!

16:08.240 --> 16:10.270
<i>Lov</i> e- <i>1 5</i>.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.350
<i>lt could be a long day</i>.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.190
We're having some fun now!

16:16.160 --> 16:18.510
l thought
you put the tennis in Tennessee.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.830
l guess l just kind of left it there.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.950
-Cute outfit though, right?
-Not cute enough.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.430
<i>Honey, the court's over here</i>.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.760
Yeah, l know. Just a loose lace.
Let me just take care of that over here.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.550
Stop talking!
You're making me look bad.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.950
l wouldn't know. l can't see.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.870
Well, boo-hoo fricky-fricky hoo.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.480
Excuse me, ma'am, do you mind taking
off your hat? My friend can't see.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.430
Of course. l'm sorry.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.600
Sweet niblets.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.790
Hey, Rico, nice sweater.

17:07.880 --> 17:11.510
lt's not a sweater.
l was petting cats all day.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.430
Hey, Jackson, you ready to go?

17:17.599 --> 17:19.430
Yeah. Just one sec.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.990
Listen, boss,
l got to leave a little early, so...

17:23.040 --> 17:26.240
Don't give it a second thought,
but before you go

17:26.280 --> 17:29.400
l promised a couple of Wilderness Girls
l'd find them a ride.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.270
Their mom's car ran out of gas,
and they need to deliver their cookies.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.750
Well, Rico, l'm getting ready to leave.

17:34.800 --> 17:40.190
l was a Wilderness Girl once.
Jackson, go ahead. l mean, l'll wait.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.760
Okay.
l mean, two girls, how long can it take?

17:45.400 --> 17:47.390
Follow this nice man, kids.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.190
l'll go help your mom
unload the rest of the truck.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.830
The truck?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.630
lt's been 45 minutes. Switch with me.

18:09.680 --> 18:13.070
No! l get the best seat
'cause l'm her best friend.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.840
You mean her greediest friend!

18:14.880 --> 18:17.630
Well, it's better than
being her dumbest friend!

18:20.000 --> 18:21.720
l'd rather be stupid than greedy.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.190
Of course, 'cause you're stupid.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.110
Will you two just work it out?

18:29.480 --> 18:31.910
l'm gonna remember that, Dakota.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.790
-Steph, you're still here!
-Jackson, what's that all over you?

18:42.840 --> 18:44.190
Cookies!

18:44.880 --> 18:48.670
l didn't drive fast enough, so
the Wilderness Girls threw them at me,

18:48.720 --> 18:51.390
but, on the plus side, we don't
have to buy candy at the movies.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.830
Do you like Chocolate ButterClusters
or FatMints?

18:55.520 --> 18:56.710
Wait.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.230
l promised that little boy
you'd get his kite off of that tree.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.550
What?

19:01.040 --> 19:03.920
And then you have to help me get
a beached whale back into the ocean.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.630
-But...
-And also there's...

19:06.680 --> 19:09.910
Wait a minute,
l know exactly what's going on.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.670
He hired you, didn't he? Didn't he?

19:12.720 --> 19:15.680
Jackson, what's wrong with you?

19:15.720 --> 19:18.760
That's right, cry!
Cry, you little faker! You little...

19:18.800 --> 19:22.150
Jackson, you're... You're horrible!

19:22.200 --> 19:24.110
Wait, Steph! You don't understand!

19:24.160 --> 19:27.670
l hired a fortuneteller
to scare Rico into being nice!

19:27.720 --> 19:31.760
Somehow he found out, and now
he's trying to get back at me! Steph!

19:33.960 --> 19:37.110
Jackson, Jackson, Jackson.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.350
All right, who told you?

19:39.400 --> 19:41.630
Actually, you did. Just now.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.230
-What?
-Up until then, l didn't have a clue.

19:46.160 --> 19:49.040
Now, l've got a lot of mean
to catch up on,

19:50.200 --> 19:55.640
and you know what they say,
cruelty, like charity, begins at home.

20:00.600 --> 20:04.670
<i>Well, with this serve</i>,
<i>Roddick-Fanning could win the match</i>,

20:05.120 --> 20:08.550
<i>and let's face it</i>,
<i>my dog and l could win the match</i>.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.950
l swear, if you cost me this match,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.230
l will go home tonight,
dress up like you

20:15.280 --> 20:17.670
and hit myself in the face.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.120
You have got some serious issues,
my friend.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.520
Excuse me.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.590
Sorry. l lost a nickel.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.960
Keep it.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.430
-What are you doing in my hair?
-Sorry, my hand's stuck.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.280
Well, get it out!

20:47.320 --> 20:48.640
Help me.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.070
Like l said, you're pathetic.

20:54.760 --> 20:58.270
Great, now l'm stuck.
You and your stupid rings.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.830
-lt's a lob! l got it!
-No, no, no.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.630
-l got it.
-l got it.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.390
l'm sorry l was jealous.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.720
And l'm sorry
we made this your problem

21:31.760 --> 21:33.430
when it was clearly Lilly's.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.560
And mine.

21:36.160 --> 21:39.280
And, next time Hannah has one ticket,
you should go.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.710
-No, you should go.
-l said you!

21:41.760 --> 21:45.110
-No, you. You're impossible!
-You're impossibler!

21:47.040 --> 21:50.710
Hello! Girl wrapped up in a net here!

21:56.200 --> 21:59.590
Yes, very interesting.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.520
What do you see?

22:01.560 --> 22:05.150
You, dancing in front of many people.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.750
Fortuneteller say what?

22:10.760 --> 22:12.870
l'm not much of a dancer.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.350
l can see that, too.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.590
But if you would just bend your knees...

22:19.640 --> 22:22.710
That's it. Give it a rest, woman.
l'm out of here.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.190
Oh, sure, now you move your feet!
