WEBVTT

00:08.570 --> 00:10.174
You know, that's running.

00:10.209 --> 00:11.340
You know, running hurts.

00:11.375 --> 00:13.078
Life hurts.

00:15.676 --> 00:18.776
I was like, "Hey, Mom,
I'm gonna be on TV."

00:18.811 --> 00:21.350
And, you know, Mom,
she was just like,

00:21.385 --> 00:23.517
"Yeah, right!"

00:23.552 --> 00:25.090
When I cross the finish line,

00:25.125 --> 00:26.586
I will...

00:31.197 --> 00:32.592
...I don't know.

00:35.366 --> 00:37.465
That's why you run the race.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.565
Woo!

01:08.597 --> 01:11.499
Boston is like the Colosseum,

01:11.534 --> 01:13.402
and we're like gladiators

01:13.437 --> 01:15.668
out here in these
small provinces...

01:18.277 --> 01:20.310
...hoping to make it to Rome.

01:22.578 --> 01:25.381
I missed qualifying for
the Boston Marathon last year

01:25.416 --> 01:28.747
by nine seconds.

01:28.782 --> 01:32.685
Do you know how short
nine seconds is?

01:32.720 --> 01:33.818
Okay, well, that was,

01:33.853 --> 01:35.754
that was four seconds, so.

01:35.789 --> 01:38.691
Do you know how short
nine seconds is?

01:43.632 --> 01:44.895
That was six seconds, okay.

01:44.930 --> 01:45.863
No, I can get this.

01:45.898 --> 01:48.239
A world record would
mean the world to me.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.208
Validates months of training,

01:50.243 --> 01:51.902
waking up at
6:00 AM each morning,

01:51.937 --> 01:55.312
lost time with
friends and family,

01:55.347 --> 01:57.908
but it'll all be worth it
when I'm in the record books.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.910
My name's Jenna Kowalski,

01:59.945 --> 02:02.220
and I am attempting to
break the world's record

02:02.255 --> 02:05.289
for fastest marathon time
dressed as a fruit.

02:05.324 --> 02:06.554
Victoria King

02:06.589 --> 02:08.325
holds the current record,

02:08.360 --> 02:09.458
four hours,

02:09.493 --> 02:11.163
thirteen minutes,
twenty-four seconds,

02:11.198 --> 02:13.396
dressed as a strawberry.

02:13.431 --> 02:15.266
I'm comin' for you, King.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.696
I started running
when I was in middle school.

02:16.731 --> 02:18.632
It was the only way
I could get away from

02:18.667 --> 02:21.470
my family, school,
just life, it's just

02:21.505 --> 02:23.340
my way of just
copin' with myself.

02:23.375 --> 02:27.278
I've been tryin' to run
a marathon for some time now,

02:27.313 --> 02:29.808
but apparently there
are a number of crimes

02:29.843 --> 02:31.645
that are committed by guys

02:31.680 --> 02:34.483
in gym shorts with no pockets.

02:34.518 --> 02:36.419
Well, I started running

02:36.454 --> 02:39.686
because--I started,

02:39.721 --> 02:41.292
I started running

02:41.327 --> 02:44.790
to get away from my house,

02:44.825 --> 02:47.595
but now I run because

02:47.630 --> 02:50.268
it reminds me of who I was

02:50.303 --> 02:51.599
before.

02:54.637 --> 02:57.671
I'm running the marathon
because I'm in a rut.

02:57.706 --> 03:00.443
Well, not really a rut,
like a ditch.

03:00.478 --> 03:01.444
Small ditch.

03:01.479 --> 03:03.578
Wow, okay.

03:03.613 --> 03:05.976
Big map.

03:06.011 --> 03:09.683
Twenty-six miles.

03:12.523 --> 03:13.621
Wow.

03:13.656 --> 03:17.229
Twenty-six miles.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.890
Um.

03:18.925 --> 03:20.991
Shit, 26!

03:21.026 --> 03:22.465
Oh, no.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.401
They should put that
on the website.

03:24.436 --> 03:25.600
Let's go to Rome.

03:29.771 --> 03:32.739
I founded, uh,
Devil's Canyon Marathon

03:32.774 --> 03:34.378
15 years ago,

03:34.413 --> 03:38.349
um, which it's
an exciting year, 15 years.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.812
We're gonna celebrate
our own way,

03:39.847 --> 03:43.750
The Devil's Canyon way,
as I like to say.

03:43.785 --> 03:46.456
Well, we're celebrating with,
you know, our usual swag,

03:46.491 --> 03:48.722
the medals, and the cheering,

03:48.757 --> 03:50.955
and the, the, you know,

03:50.990 --> 03:53.694
the usual Devil's Canyon way.

03:53.729 --> 03:55.564
Nothing different for 15.

03:55.599 --> 03:58.699
Training in uniform helps
identify trouble spots.

03:58.734 --> 04:00.701
So, friction against
the forehead,

04:00.736 --> 04:02.406
reduced stride,

04:02.441 --> 04:04.672
all these issues have to be
ironed out before race day.

04:04.707 --> 04:07.609
Here's the secret
to running a marathon:

04:07.644 --> 04:09.039
quit early!

04:13.386 --> 04:15.980
Unless you wanna keep recording.

04:16.015 --> 04:16.981
I'm here for it.

04:17.016 --> 04:18.950
We're here for it.

04:18.985 --> 04:21.920
I chose Devil's Canyon because
it's a Boston qualifier.

04:21.955 --> 04:24.626
Like Pre--Steve Prefontaine,

04:24.661 --> 04:27.563
I'm a front runner
in all aspects of my life.

04:27.598 --> 04:29.796
Ugh, God! Oh!

04:29.831 --> 04:31.963
I can't let fear
dictate my decisions.

04:31.998 --> 04:35.604
I wanna run a marathon,
so I'm gonna run a marathon!

04:35.639 --> 04:36.671
Entry form,

04:36.706 --> 04:39.905
Devil's Canyon.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.940
The hardest part about
planning a marathon is

04:41.975 --> 04:44.008
the permit process.

04:44.043 --> 04:45.944
I mean, we've been doing this
for more than a decade,

04:45.979 --> 04:48.650
and we still
haven't been approved.

04:48.685 --> 04:51.356
They started to, uh,
see us coming,

04:51.391 --> 04:53.424
and, uh, locked the doors
at city hall.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.557
I'm just like,

04:54.592 --> 04:56.394
"Guys, it's business hours.

04:56.429 --> 04:57.659
You gotta let me in."

04:57.694 --> 04:59.397
I was training
for my first marathon

04:59.432 --> 05:01.333
when I got pregnant, so...

05:02.028 --> 05:03.500
I know, right?

05:03.535 --> 05:05.436
And I had to stop 'cause of you!

05:05.471 --> 05:09.066
But, now I feel like
after a year of being a mom,

05:09.101 --> 05:10.969
I feel like I'm finally
coming up for air.

05:12.874 --> 05:14.775
Oh, that's a weird one.

05:14.810 --> 05:17.778
There is a stigma
to being a costume runner.

05:17.813 --> 05:20.418
Faster competitors
don't take you serious,

05:20.453 --> 05:21.452
slower runners think you're

05:21.487 --> 05:23.586
making a mockery
of the marathon,

05:23.621 --> 05:27.018
which couldn't be
further from the truth.

05:28.428 --> 05:31.693
Being the average
marathoner is 35, male,

05:31.728 --> 05:34.366
predominately middle-
to upper-class,

05:34.401 --> 05:36.797
she has 26 miles
to find herself a husband.

05:36.832 --> 05:40.504
No, I--I mean, "alone,"
that's, what does that mean?

05:40.539 --> 05:42.132
I wouldn't date a runner.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.903
Try getting into an argument

05:43.938 --> 05:46.070
two miles into a 20-mile run.

05:46.105 --> 05:47.544
"Oh, you let me win.

05:47.579 --> 05:48.974
Why you passin' me?

05:49.009 --> 05:51.977
Oh, who's callin' you
from this area code?

05:52.012 --> 05:55.585
Oh, she don't look
like a work friend."

05:55.620 --> 05:56.916
None of these houses
are on the market

05:56.951 --> 05:58.654
'cause we moved 'em all.

05:58.689 --> 06:01.657
Yeah, not too much in my life
is on the market right now.

06:01.692 --> 06:03.087
I'm off, uh,
I'm off the market.

06:03.122 --> 06:04.726
I'm not in the dating pool.

06:04.761 --> 06:07.729
I'm taking some
time to focus on myself.

06:07.764 --> 06:11.095
Uh, I've taken two years,
and I think I might, uh,

06:11.130 --> 06:14.131
I might just keep ridin' it
because it feels pretty great.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.507
Miles, can you say "mama?"

06:16.542 --> 06:18.608
Yeah.

06:19.677 --> 06:20.973
Say, "mama."

06:21.976 --> 06:23.074
Can you say "ma--"

06:24.979 --> 06:26.517
Miles can say "mama."

06:26.552 --> 06:28.013
I've heard him say it.

06:28.048 --> 06:29.520
He's called Michael mama.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.523
He's called his
happy hippo mama.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.558
He's called his car seat mama,

06:34.593 --> 06:35.955
but not me.

06:35.990 --> 06:37.627
Hasn't, um,

06:37.662 --> 06:40.861
called me mama, not once.

06:40.896 --> 06:42.062
Not once.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.799
Finishin' a marathon means
provin' my sister wrong

06:44.834 --> 06:46.031
once and for all,

06:46.066 --> 06:48.704
or just once.

06:48.739 --> 06:50.035
She's a triathlete,

06:50.070 --> 06:52.642
and I just "try."

06:52.677 --> 06:55.513
-Her words.
-"I'm tired, I'm hot."

06:55.548 --> 06:57.911
He's like a little baby
that you're just like,

06:57.946 --> 06:59.847
"Come on, grow up already."

06:59.882 --> 07:00.848
He can't finish a marathon.

07:00.883 --> 07:02.718
He can't even tie his own shoes.

07:02.753 --> 07:05.754
Banana, that would not
have been my first choice.

07:05.789 --> 07:08.988
Something more vaginal,
like a guava,

07:09.023 --> 07:10.187
you know?

07:10.222 --> 07:12.629
Men see a guava
running at them--

07:12.664 --> 07:14.631
Papaya, oh, that's beautiful.

07:14.666 --> 07:18.899
I started running
right after my divorce.

07:18.934 --> 07:20.934
Well, actually, it was, uh,

07:20.969 --> 07:22.672
it was when we first
started having problems.

07:22.707 --> 07:25.235
That's when I
picked up running.

07:25.270 --> 07:28.612
Yeah, in hindsight,
the running probably

07:28.647 --> 07:29.479
drew us further apart,

07:29.515 --> 07:33.881
but hindsight's
always 50/50, so.

07:33.916 --> 07:35.245
Same as a divorce, right?

07:35.280 --> 07:37.181
We met at a 5K fun run.

07:37.216 --> 07:39.249
-It was miserable.
-Right.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.086
I didn't wanna look like
I was trying too hard,

07:41.121 --> 07:43.495
so I was breathing
only outta my nose.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.496
Mm-hmm.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.223
-'Cause I felt like--
-And I literally thought

07:46.258 --> 07:47.598
there was a horse behind me.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.567
-I was like, "Ee."
-Yeah, yeah.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.066
I was like, "I have to,

07:52.101 --> 07:54.165
I think I'm gonna have to
take this guy to the hospital."

07:54.200 --> 07:55.903
I feel like if someone
screws up a marriage,

07:55.938 --> 07:58.741
they should have to find you--
however long it takes--

07:58.776 --> 08:01.172
they should have
to keep searching

08:01.207 --> 08:02.778
until they find you

08:02.813 --> 08:04.615
a replacement spouse.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.012
That's just--I don't know,

08:06.047 --> 08:07.684
that just sounds
like human decency.

08:07.719 --> 08:11.853
But I found running, so,
I mean, I'm not alone.

08:11.888 --> 08:14.119
Uh, yeah, I'm single.

08:14.154 --> 08:15.626
I don't see how that has

08:15.661 --> 08:17.254
anything to do
with the marathon.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.860
There's more to women than men.

08:21.832 --> 08:23.898
Well...

08:23.933 --> 08:25.163
I have

08:25.198 --> 08:29.937
six new pairs of socks!

08:29.972 --> 08:31.741
So, pretty well.

08:31.776 --> 08:34.007
And they were like, "Why do
you need pyro for a marathon?"

08:34.042 --> 08:35.778
And it was just like,

08:35.813 --> 08:37.879
"Marathons are boring
without pyro.

08:37.914 --> 08:40.816
It's just people running!"

08:40.851 --> 08:43.115
I think people run for a lot
of different reasons, you know.

08:43.150 --> 08:45.084
Sometimes you're
running to something,

08:45.119 --> 08:47.020
sometimes you're
running from something.

08:47.055 --> 08:50.320
Um, I mean, mostly,
I just run to win.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.962
I run for a sense
of accomplishment

08:54.997 --> 08:57.228
and stress relief.

09:04.105 --> 09:07.073
Yeah, most people
zone out when they run,

09:07.108 --> 09:09.207
not me, I'm just the opposite.

09:09.242 --> 09:11.044
I like to focus on the pain

09:11.079 --> 09:14.179
and the agony of every step.

09:14.214 --> 09:15.279
It helps to pass the time.

09:19.252 --> 09:20.151
Usually, when he sleeps,

09:20.187 --> 09:24.123
um, I run a few laps
around our neighborhood,

09:24.158 --> 09:26.026
but I can only go so far 'cause

09:26.061 --> 09:27.896
the monitor only goes so far.

09:27.931 --> 09:30.998
Hold on, sometimes he cries
and then goes back to sleep.

09:37.204 --> 09:38.973
Victoria King
ran as a strawberry,

09:39.008 --> 09:41.745
which, honestly,
is a little uninspiring,

09:41.780 --> 09:45.012
but that's why I went--

09:45.047 --> 09:46.046
What?

09:52.923 --> 09:54.219
Hi. Who?

09:54.254 --> 09:57.288
-Who, who are you?
-Ben Duffy!

09:57.323 --> 09:59.697
I'm running the marathon.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.292
Are you fucking kidding me?

10:01.327 --> 10:03.701
Uh, no.

10:03.736 --> 10:04.999
I don't run anymore.

10:05.034 --> 10:07.705
Um, I already won my medal.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.674
Aw.

10:09.709 --> 10:12.743
Third place!

10:12.778 --> 10:14.976
Did you have that
hiding there?

10:15.011 --> 10:17.715
Bronze, I think it's real.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.816
I don't think anyone
really makes bronze anymore.

10:19.851 --> 10:22.049
I think that's burnzing,
I think is what they call it.

10:22.084 --> 10:23.116
-Burnzing is a--
-I don't think that's

10:23.151 --> 10:25.415
-real bronze.
-We love your storyline,

10:25.450 --> 10:27.252
okay, we really do,
so we're, uh,

10:27.287 --> 10:29.122
all we're doing is
where adding to it.

10:29.157 --> 10:31.663
Why is he running
the marathon as a banana?

10:31.698 --> 10:33.764
Really, really, why?

10:33.799 --> 10:36.063
Well, he--Okay.

10:36.098 --> 10:37.669
-He works for Dole.
-I knew it.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.297
-And--Look--
-Knew it!

10:39.332 --> 10:40.164
-Knew it!
-Look, that is the only way

10:40.200 --> 10:42.300
we could secure
financing for this film.

10:42.335 --> 10:43.433
An actor?

10:43.468 --> 10:44.907
God, no!

10:44.942 --> 10:46.172
He's product placement.

10:46.207 --> 10:48.273
I am a real runner.

10:48.308 --> 10:50.011
I am a real runner

10:50.046 --> 10:52.783
trying to break
a real world's record.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.719
-Mm-hmm
-Well, the two guys that beat me

10:54.754 --> 10:57.381
I don't even think
they were American.

10:57.416 --> 10:59.284
They were Black,
so they could run faster.

10:59.319 --> 11:01.220
I don't--I didn't say that.

11:01.255 --> 11:03.156
I'm sorry.

11:03.191 --> 11:04.696
It's okay, you can say Black.

11:04.731 --> 11:08.359
I don't, I don't
see runners of color.

11:08.394 --> 11:10.130
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I'm not supposed to

11:10.165 --> 11:12.033
-Ba--
-Ba--

11:12.068 --> 11:14.805
Look, I have so many friends

11:14.840 --> 11:16.004
from different neighborhoods.

11:16.039 --> 11:16.805
-Ba...
-I don't even know

11:16.840 --> 11:17.539
-where they're from.
-...lack.

11:17.574 --> 11:19.469
-I don't ask.
-Yeah, why?

11:19.504 --> 11:21.108
That's not--
Wouldn't you be curious?

11:27.919 --> 11:29.853
I don't know.

11:29.888 --> 11:31.415
I vote with my heart.

11:31.450 --> 11:34.825
I don't even see
political parties.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.123
Sometimes I don't even vote.

11:36.158 --> 11:38.026
That's how much I see
everyone as equal.

11:38.061 --> 11:40.765
I don't even vote.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.767
Ah, okay.

11:42.802 --> 11:43.768
I run in lane one.

11:43.803 --> 11:44.669
-Yes.
-Come on.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.397
-Oh, lane one--Is that lane?
-Now, yup.

11:46.432 --> 11:47.772
-Yup. Yup
-What lane is this?

11:47.807 --> 11:50.236
You are second banana, lane two.

11:50.271 --> 11:52.843
Okay, maybe from my point
of view, I am first banana.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.207
What did you say?

11:54.242 --> 11:57.947
-This one?
-Yes.

11:57.982 --> 11:59.179
Ha! Ha!

11:59.214 --> 12:03.282
I know who you are.

12:03.317 --> 12:04.350
All right.

12:04.385 --> 12:07.022
Doin' eight miles,
speed intervals mixed in,

12:07.057 --> 12:09.123
pick--God dammit.

12:11.061 --> 12:14.524
Boston, Chicago,
all the big races are,

12:14.559 --> 12:19.166
are pushing out the smaller
mom and pop races like us.

12:19.201 --> 12:22.268
I mean,

12:22.303 --> 12:24.336
shop local, run local.

12:24.371 --> 12:25.403
That's what I say.

12:25.438 --> 12:27.504
Just cooperate, okay?

12:27.539 --> 12:28.945
All right, and we can
make this thing work.

12:28.980 --> 12:30.474
-Yeah, I'll cooperate.
-All right?

12:30.509 --> 12:31.341
-But I'm gonna be--
-Great.

12:31.377 --> 12:33.213
I'm gonna be
a real dick about it.

12:33.248 --> 12:36.183
So how did you
get into running Ben?

12:36.218 --> 12:38.856
My mother was a runner!

12:38.891 --> 12:41.859
Rest in peace.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.553
Osteoporosis.

12:43.588 --> 12:47.062
The doctor said if
she had just eaten more

12:47.097 --> 12:48.492
bananas,

12:48.527 --> 12:50.934
specifically Dole bananas,

12:50.969 --> 12:53.563
she would have stood
a fighting chance.

12:53.598 --> 12:57.006
Wow, Ben,
that's a great back story.

12:57.041 --> 12:59.206
-It's heartfelt and emotional.
-Cut!

12:59.241 --> 13:01.571
Missing Boston again
by nine seconds,

13:01.606 --> 13:03.375
that's my biggest fear,

13:03.410 --> 13:05.080
or a terrorist attack.

13:05.115 --> 13:06.576
Boston strong.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.853
I mean,

13:08.888 --> 13:11.548
the Boston attack, it was,

13:11.583 --> 13:13.484
it was horrible.

13:16.159 --> 13:17.488
And then when I found out that

13:17.523 --> 13:20.194
they had more entries
the next year,

13:20.229 --> 13:24.429
I just--I mean, we,

13:24.464 --> 13:25.936
we can't compete!

13:25.971 --> 13:29.203
Oh, this is, uh,
for testicular cancer.

13:29.238 --> 13:30.104
I'm donating a dollar

13:30.139 --> 13:32.943
for every minute
of my race to charity.

13:39.116 --> 13:40.511
No, that's--

13:40.546 --> 13:42.612
No.

13:42.647 --> 13:45.186
They pay me for every mile,

13:45.221 --> 13:48.387
but then all the money that
I don't get goes to charity.

13:48.422 --> 13:50.928
With running,
you gotta stay on schedule.

13:50.963 --> 13:53.161
You miss one day,
you're screwed!

13:53.196 --> 13:55.229
It's like birth control.

13:55.264 --> 13:56.362
No.

13:56.397 --> 13:59.332
Running just purifies the...

13:59.367 --> 14:01.103
body--I'm sorry, I'm really

14:01.138 --> 14:04.304
having trouble with
how the math works on this.

14:04.339 --> 14:05.877
So, people who run--

14:05.912 --> 14:06.878
What am I supposed to run

14:06.913 --> 14:08.880
slow so I can give more money?

14:08.915 --> 14:11.278
Or do I start with a--

14:11.313 --> 14:15.117
Birth control, you're screwed

14:15.152 --> 14:17.955
first?

14:17.990 --> 14:20.485
Then, if you miss a day,

14:20.520 --> 14:24.357
you're also screwed.

14:24.392 --> 14:27.162
It's not like birth control.

14:27.197 --> 14:30.902
$926, that's--

14:30.937 --> 14:32.497
Well, that's a lot,
that's a lot,

14:32.532 --> 14:35.170
that's a good chunk of change.

14:35.205 --> 14:39.944
I'm not afraid to
donate that, I just,

14:39.979 --> 14:42.111
I mean, I don't think
I should have to pay for

14:42.146 --> 14:44.674
all of the cure either, though.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.049
Um.

14:46.084 --> 14:48.018
You know, I'm not running away

14:48.053 --> 14:50.053
from my identity as a mother,

14:50.088 --> 14:51.681
like, I love being a mother.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.518
I love Miles!

14:53.553 --> 14:56.521
-I think I just--
-Honey, where's his bottle?

14:58.558 --> 15:00.261
It's in the fridge.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.660
I think that, um,

15:03.695 --> 15:04.694
-I'm really trying--
-Garage fridge

15:04.729 --> 15:05.629
or kitchen fridge?

15:05.664 --> 15:07.466
It's in the kitchen fridge!

15:07.501 --> 15:10.370
Yeah, it means a lot to me
if you're at the finish line

15:10.405 --> 15:12.537
to eat your words!

15:12.572 --> 15:13.439
I don't see it.

15:13.474 --> 15:14.979
Did you look?

15:15.014 --> 15:19.214
Did you look with your eyes,
are you looking?

15:19.249 --> 15:21.216
-It's in the door.
-Found it, it's in the door.

15:21.251 --> 15:22.349
What was that?

15:22.384 --> 15:23.350
Wait, what?

15:23.385 --> 15:25.352
I know you did the Ironman.

15:25.387 --> 15:26.520
I got the Christmas card!

15:26.555 --> 15:30.060
You put it in the warmer,
and it'll come together.

15:32.130 --> 15:33.294
Sorry.

15:33.329 --> 15:36.561
Um, yeah, I feel like I--

15:36.596 --> 15:38.596
Which cabinet is the warmer in?

15:40.402 --> 15:42.204
-I'm really trying to ident--
-Can I just put it in

15:42.239 --> 15:44.008
-the microwave?
-Are you fucking kidding me?

15:49.081 --> 15:50.080
Are we still off the record?

15:53.052 --> 15:54.711
Nope.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.120
Can we talk about
something happy now?

16:03.458 --> 16:05.029
I don't know.

16:05.064 --> 16:07.163
Night runs are a fun
way to beat the heat,

16:07.198 --> 16:10.331
but you have to take
the necessary precautions.

16:15.470 --> 16:17.569
What's your greatest fear?

16:17.604 --> 16:19.439
My biggest fear

16:19.474 --> 16:23.113
is probably...

16:25.315 --> 16:27.249
...global warming?

16:27.284 --> 16:28.415
Fear,

16:28.450 --> 16:30.714
that's why people
run a marathon.

16:30.749 --> 16:32.353
Fear of being fat.

16:32.388 --> 16:35.422
Fear of dying, disease.

16:35.457 --> 16:37.259
In my opinion,
it takes more courage

16:37.294 --> 16:38.623
not to run a marathon.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.593
Big half marathon tomorrow.

16:41.628 --> 16:43.331
Pre-race meal is critical.

16:43.366 --> 16:45.234
Crab loading ups
the glycogen levels

16:45.269 --> 16:48.402
and prevents the body
from burning reserve fats.

16:48.437 --> 16:51.438
This helps the runner
endure for longer distances.

16:51.473 --> 16:54.441
It's a little perk
of the job, get to--

16:54.476 --> 16:56.641
Before every race,
get to eat a lot of crab.

16:56.676 --> 16:58.016
Em?

16:59.778 --> 17:00.810
-Oh, my God!
-Hey!

17:00.845 --> 17:02.284
-Hey!
-Oh.

17:02.319 --> 17:04.088
How are you?

17:04.123 --> 17:04.814
Good.

17:04.849 --> 17:07.157
Uh, what's with the camera?

17:07.192 --> 17:09.456
Oh, uh, he's filming me
while I train for a marathon.

17:09.491 --> 17:11.425
A marathon?
You're running a marathon?

17:12.395 --> 17:13.196
No.

17:21.668 --> 17:23.404
-Call me sometime?
-Yeah, oh, yeah.

17:23.439 --> 17:24.570
-Okay.
-Uh, good to see you.

17:24.605 --> 17:26.440
-Yeah, you too, bye.
-Okay.

17:26.475 --> 17:29.443
Bye!

17:29.478 --> 17:32.578
That's "Big Dick" Brian
from high school.

17:32.613 --> 17:34.283
He's a quarterback.

17:34.318 --> 17:35.647
No, it's not
what everybody does.

17:35.682 --> 17:36.615
It's what I do.

17:36.650 --> 17:38.287
I'm not most runners, okay?

17:38.322 --> 17:40.487
If I had meant carb loading,
I would have said carb loading.

17:40.522 --> 17:41.455
I mean crab loading.

17:41.490 --> 17:42.621
When their carbs give out,

17:42.656 --> 17:44.557
that's when my crabs kick in.

17:44.592 --> 17:46.328
Aw, man!

17:46.363 --> 17:49.694
"Big Dick" Brian!

17:49.729 --> 17:52.334
It's the little
things in life, huh?

17:52.369 --> 17:54.105
Oh! He's a doctor--
No, wait, I'm sorry.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.799
He's a dentist.

17:55.834 --> 17:58.769
Dentist.

17:58.804 --> 17:59.636
That good?

17:59.672 --> 18:01.178
-Yeah, you're good.
-I'm good?

18:01.213 --> 18:02.179
I feel something.

18:05.778 --> 18:07.184
Oh, yeah, is it?

18:07.219 --> 18:09.483
Yeah, let's just
follow the leader, huh?

18:09.518 --> 18:10.781
Yeah, carb load.

18:10.816 --> 18:12.651
Great idea, Jeff, mm.

18:12.686 --> 18:13.718
I'm not gonna do that,
you know what,

18:13.753 --> 18:15.687
this is fuckin' ridiculous!

18:15.722 --> 18:17.260
It's a documentary!

18:17.295 --> 18:19.526
You shouldn't be
asking me questions.

19:02.439 --> 19:05.803
oh sweet darlin'

19:09.974 --> 19:11.512
Ya can't bring up
that he's an actor.

19:11.547 --> 19:13.382
He is an actor.

19:13.417 --> 19:14.647
Kind of.

19:14.682 --> 19:16.484
-Yeah. No!
-He's not very good.

19:16.519 --> 19:17.914
Devil's Canyon
was four months out

19:17.949 --> 19:19.586
when I decided to
try for the record,

19:19.621 --> 19:21.885
so schedules lined up perfectly.

19:23.592 --> 19:26.824
It's where we buried
my mother's ashes.

19:26.859 --> 19:30.564
Her brittle bones crumbling
through my fingers like

19:30.599 --> 19:32.203
chalk!

19:37.738 --> 19:40.772
Stupid! Stupid!

19:42.413 --> 19:44.545
I wouldn't run a marathon
for two reasons.

19:44.580 --> 19:48.516
The first, um, I don't really
like the clothes that you wear.

19:48.551 --> 19:51.882
Uh, they're not
flattering to my body type.

19:51.917 --> 19:53.389
I look better in,

19:53.424 --> 19:56.755
in more upscale
sort of clothing.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.559
Secondly,

19:58.594 --> 20:01.661
I don't enjoy
the people that run.

20:01.696 --> 20:03.432
This is what we call
a tune-up half,

20:03.467 --> 20:04.730
or a tunie halfie,

20:04.765 --> 20:07.997
but I never half-did
anything in my life.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.867
Wish me luck.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.006
You're not gonna say it?

20:17.041 --> 20:17.707
It's a superstition,

20:17.742 --> 20:21.010
I need you to say, "Good luck."

20:21.045 --> 20:22.814
Fine, all right,
good luck, Jeff!

20:25.621 --> 20:26.521
Say, "Good luck."

20:27.689 --> 20:29.260
Say, "Good luck."

20:29.295 --> 20:30.921
Even a fly would say,
"Good luck."

20:30.956 --> 20:32.725
Hey, good luck.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.331
Good luck.

20:34.366 --> 20:35.563
Good luck.

20:35.598 --> 20:37.631
Jesus Christ!

20:37.666 --> 20:40.865
So, you know, you go to,
like, parks and libraries,

20:40.900 --> 20:43.835
anything they can kind of,
like, stare at, or, like,

20:43.870 --> 20:47.245
run around and try to destroy.

20:49.843 --> 20:51.546
Okay!

20:51.581 --> 20:53.449
Miles, you ready?

20:53.484 --> 20:54.417
Do you know where the keys are?

20:54.452 --> 20:55.715
Mama's keys?

20:57.851 --> 21:00.324
Did you throw it
down here, honey?

21:00.359 --> 21:02.722
The longest I've run

21:02.757 --> 21:06.022
outside is about three miles.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.629
The police chased me
for the last 800 meters.

21:08.664 --> 21:10.796
A treadmill's convenient
for a lot of reasons.

21:10.831 --> 21:13.700
You just can't jog around
the neighborhood every day.

21:13.735 --> 21:15.768
That'd be crazy!

21:17.002 --> 21:19.310
Um, can you just like,

21:19.345 --> 21:21.037
can you just watch him
for just a second?

21:29.652 --> 21:32.323
Television commercials, nothing.

21:32.358 --> 21:34.325
The radio commercials,
that was fun.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.226
I did all the voices.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.559
Yeah, I can't afford
a voiceover guy.

21:37.594 --> 21:40.661
Those, those pros are expensive.

21:44.128 --> 21:46.667
I read in an advertising book

21:46.702 --> 21:48.636
that I got at
the library one time

21:48.671 --> 21:50.605
that you need to, uh,

21:50.640 --> 21:52.409
get it into people's heads

21:52.444 --> 21:55.445
seven times before
they remember it.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.909
So, we just said,
"What's that?

21:57.944 --> 21:58.877
"Devil's Canyon."

21:58.912 --> 21:59.944
Seven times.

21:59.979 --> 22:03.717
Miles, say, "mama."

22:03.752 --> 22:04.982
-No.
-No?

22:05.952 --> 22:07.050
We did get a call from,

22:07.085 --> 22:08.557
from, from Disney

22:08.592 --> 22:10.592
saying to--

22:10.627 --> 22:12.363
They gave us a cease and desist.

22:12.398 --> 22:15.091
"He has more of a
Southern California drawl."

22:15.126 --> 22:17.632
"Mine is,
you know, Midwest."

22:20.439 --> 22:23.836
T-H-O-N

22:29.910 --> 22:32.515
Set a PR, personal record.

22:32.550 --> 22:34.847
Still feels like
I'm slumming it.

22:34.882 --> 22:37.487
I don't wanna say I'm
better than these runners,

22:37.522 --> 22:38.785
but I am faster than they are,

22:38.820 --> 22:40.952
so draw your own conclusions.

22:40.987 --> 22:42.789
Hey, good race, you guys.

22:42.824 --> 22:45.462
Good race.

22:45.497 --> 22:46.595
Losers.

22:48.665 --> 22:51.061
Sequoia doesn't think
running's a real sport.

22:51.096 --> 22:52.634
It's not!

22:52.669 --> 22:55.736
If everyone can do it,
then it's not a sport.

22:55.771 --> 22:57.441
Is shitting a sport?

23:00.677 --> 23:02.842
In high school,
I was all-state.

23:02.877 --> 23:05.845
Oh, great, you do
insurance commercials too?

23:07.684 --> 23:11.884
Yeah, I'm auditioning for them.

23:11.919 --> 23:13.853
I'll tell you what's a marathon,

23:13.888 --> 23:16.922
scrolling through your
entire Facebook timeline.

23:19.927 --> 23:21.663
"Big Dick" Brian.

23:23.865 --> 23:24.996
I can't just call him,
I gotta like,

23:25.031 --> 23:27.130
"Woops, we ran into each other.

23:27.165 --> 23:28.670
Oops, not again!

23:28.705 --> 23:30.199
Woops!

23:30.234 --> 23:31.970
Call me."

23:32.005 --> 23:34.170
See what I'm saying,
so, figure out where they go

23:34.205 --> 23:35.644
instead of calling him.

23:35.679 --> 23:37.448
Is that weirder?

23:39.683 --> 23:40.781
Feels better.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.951
Hey!

23:45.986 --> 23:49.757
-Why do you hate me?
-Because you're a fraud!

23:49.792 --> 23:51.154
I'm an actor.

23:51.189 --> 23:52.430
What's the difference?

23:55.160 --> 23:57.930
He's gonna call.

23:57.965 --> 24:00.471
You can just tell

24:00.506 --> 24:02.506
from his eyeballs.

24:02.541 --> 24:05.036
He's gonna call.

24:05.071 --> 24:06.576
I'm sorry.

24:19.085 --> 24:21.184
But if he doesn't,
but if he doesn't call,

24:21.219 --> 24:24.891
I think my mom is still
friends with his mom, so.

24:28.666 --> 24:31.062
He's, he's dead.

24:31.097 --> 24:33.262
I mean, not the character,

24:33.297 --> 24:35.198
the guy in the suit.

24:35.233 --> 24:36.837
He had heat stroke,

24:36.872 --> 24:39.543
and, um, it was 115.

24:41.074 --> 24:43.943
And, I don't know if you
know this about heat stroke,

24:43.978 --> 24:47.078
it kind of changes
your brain chemistry,

24:47.113 --> 24:49.245
so he, um...

24:52.756 --> 24:54.624
...he got violent.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.692
And, in his mouse costume,

24:56.727 --> 24:57.594
he went around,

24:57.629 --> 24:59.530
and just went on a rampage.

24:59.565 --> 25:03.600
Just this gigantic
mouse rampage.

25:03.635 --> 25:06.603
And he just, just
knocked over tables,

25:06.638 --> 25:08.770
just pushed over children,

25:08.805 --> 25:10.266
and was just being an ass.

25:10.301 --> 25:14.578
Boston flight is

25:14.613 --> 25:16.074
booked!

25:17.913 --> 25:20.012
Confidence breeds confidence.

25:20.047 --> 25:22.553
There's an old saying,
"Man makes plans

25:22.588 --> 25:23.983
and God laughs"

25:24.018 --> 25:25.284
out of joy

25:25.320 --> 25:29.659
because he's glad that you're
setting a goal for yourself.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.023
Ugh.

25:31.058 --> 25:33.696
Playgrounds are cesspools.

25:33.731 --> 25:35.830
I'm gonna be,
I'm gonna be fine.

25:35.865 --> 25:37.568
It's just a little setback.

25:37.603 --> 25:39.900
I'm not that sick,
it's just a little sick.

25:39.935 --> 25:42.232
It's just kind of
in my bones right now,

25:42.267 --> 25:44.135
so it's just gotta come out.

25:49.780 --> 25:51.010
Today we're gonna be runnin',

25:51.045 --> 25:52.616
and in addition to
the weight of my body,

25:52.651 --> 25:54.717
I'm gonna have two and a half
pounds of extra weight

25:54.752 --> 25:56.213
on each ankle.

25:56.248 --> 25:58.116
Eat your heart out, Boston.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.600
Eat your heart out, Boston.

26:12.033 --> 26:13.230
Oh, God, they're heavy.

26:13.265 --> 26:14.330
Wow.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.848
It's on!

26:26.883 --> 26:28.278
Oh, I didn't fill it.

26:28.313 --> 26:29.917
What happened
between me and Ben

26:29.952 --> 26:32.788
is nobody's business
but our own.

26:32.823 --> 26:36.055
So, no comment.

26:36.090 --> 26:38.926
We totally banged banana suits.

26:38.961 --> 26:40.158
We fucked.

26:40.193 --> 26:43.766
I mean, Jenna's
a perfectly lovely person.

26:43.801 --> 26:46.065
I mean, she has tics,
but we all have tics, right?

26:46.100 --> 26:48.199
I do have a sex tape, so.

26:48.234 --> 26:50.641
It's called Too Little Too Late.

26:50.676 --> 26:53.138
I mean, the budget wasn't
too crazy on the sex tape.

26:53.173 --> 26:55.239
The woman cost
something, you know.

26:55.274 --> 26:56.944
Obviously, you're not gonna get,

26:56.979 --> 26:59.375
you know, a lay person to
just do it for free, you know.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.410
Obviously,
you have to pay for it.

27:01.445 --> 27:04.413
Not that I'm admitting
being with a call girl

27:04.448 --> 27:05.920
on camera.

27:05.955 --> 27:07.284
Sorry, why don't you guys
just roll that back

27:07.319 --> 27:08.791
and cut that part out?

27:13.160 --> 27:15.028
Hope you're hungry, Jeff,

27:15.063 --> 27:17.360
'cause you're gonna be
eating my dust

27:17.395 --> 27:19.901
all day.

27:19.936 --> 27:22.805
All you can eat dust buffet.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.301
Catch up if you can,

27:24.336 --> 27:26.710
slow poke--Whoa!

27:26.745 --> 27:30.208
Okay, yes, we slept together.

27:30.243 --> 27:31.781
Ben's a method actor,

27:31.816 --> 27:35.719
so it was a bit odd.

27:43.289 --> 27:46.191
Lot of yellow.

27:46.226 --> 27:48.732
But I saw a different
side of Ben.

27:48.767 --> 27:52.197
Once you peel back
the, uh, outer layer,

27:52.232 --> 27:54.166
there's a sensitive
soul underneath.

27:54.201 --> 27:56.773
I hope you enjoy
your muscle cramps.

27:56.808 --> 27:59.776
I hope you enjoy all of your
muscles cramping on you.

27:59.811 --> 28:01.305
Oh, now you wanna run away.

28:01.340 --> 28:04.242
Now you wanna run away
because you know I'm right!

28:04.277 --> 28:05.144
That's why.

28:07.984 --> 28:09.885
She's a great motivator.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.249
She used to bully me

28:11.284 --> 28:14.021
and still does to this day.

28:14.056 --> 28:16.727
Every month, I get
a sports bra in the mail

28:16.762 --> 28:18.828
and an issue to Women's Fitness.

28:22.427 --> 28:24.427
Not everything,

28:24.462 --> 28:25.967
um,

28:26.002 --> 28:27.936
goes back to where
it's supposed to go.

28:27.971 --> 28:30.268
Did you know that
a bladder can drop?

28:30.303 --> 28:31.135
I didn't.

28:31.171 --> 28:33.073
Vagina stays there,
thank goodness,

28:33.108 --> 28:35.779
but it spreads open,
and it rips and tears.

28:38.047 --> 28:40.146
There's an old poem, uh,

28:40.181 --> 28:43.116
"A road diverged in the woods,

28:43.151 --> 28:47.252
and I took the one
less traveled by."

28:51.357 --> 28:54.996
A champion takes their own path,

28:55.031 --> 28:58.901
which is why we're going

28:58.936 --> 29:00.166
there.

29:03.237 --> 29:05.842
Feels right, doesn't it?

29:05.877 --> 29:08.075
It's a feeling you get here.

29:08.110 --> 29:11.474
Bladder is so,
so tired and weak.

29:11.509 --> 29:13.817
Oh, what a weak little bladder!

29:13.852 --> 29:14.983
It's just gonna fall.

29:15.018 --> 29:16.985
Oh, no, pee-pee time!

29:17.020 --> 29:19.416
Makes her very sad.

29:19.451 --> 29:23.123
Oh, she's not
a grown woman anymore.

29:23.158 --> 29:24.828
Why? Why?

29:24.863 --> 29:27.996
What a dumb idea,
I should have wore a condom.

29:28.031 --> 29:30.999
But I do think this the way
back to the car, seriously.

29:31.034 --> 29:32.495
I'm getting hungry.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.367
Hup-hup, let's go!

29:36.402 --> 29:38.138
Hup-hup, come on!

29:40.175 --> 29:43.814
Wanna get your Lunchable,
don't you, Jeff?

29:43.849 --> 29:45.145
You know all
the nitrates in that?

29:45.180 --> 29:46.344
You're gonna kill yourself.

29:46.379 --> 29:48.346
Oh, Jesus.

29:48.381 --> 29:50.579
Kegels, Kegels, Kegels, Kegels.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.449
What, uh, what's your

29:52.484 --> 29:54.286
favorite theatre role?

29:54.321 --> 29:59.060
Ah, well, I've been
working on Hamlet.

29:59.095 --> 30:02.558
Speak the speech,

30:02.593 --> 30:04.461
I pray you!

30:04.496 --> 30:07.299
To think not my--
Nope, not my line.

30:07.334 --> 30:10.203
Oh, God, who wrote this?

30:10.238 --> 30:12.106
Trail running,

30:12.141 --> 30:15.373
they can't teach you
this on the pavement.

30:15.408 --> 30:17.914
And you make yourselves,

30:17.949 --> 30:20.147
uh, another.

30:20.182 --> 30:21.181
You jig, you am--

30:21.216 --> 30:22.919
You a--

30:22.954 --> 30:24.921
Huh.

30:24.956 --> 30:25.822
That's a little,

30:25.857 --> 30:27.418
-little racy.
-You know it's weird

30:27.453 --> 30:28.552
that you're not saying Black,

30:28.588 --> 30:31.059
-like it's even weirder now.
-I haven't even,

30:31.094 --> 30:32.093
-I haven't e--
-Because you can't say it,

30:32.128 --> 30:33.424
then it's making it

30:33.459 --> 30:34.898
-really weird.
-We haven't even had

30:34.933 --> 30:35.932
dinner today.

30:35.968 --> 30:40.530
And all of our neighbors,
yeah, are Caucasian,

30:40.565 --> 30:43.302
but I don't think
that that makes me

30:43.337 --> 30:44.600
-in a different neighborhood.
-Safe.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.536
-It makes you feel safe.
-No, it makes--No,

30:46.571 --> 30:48.241
it doesn't make us in
a different neighborhood

30:48.276 --> 30:49.913
because our neighborhood
isn't this block.

30:49.948 --> 30:51.981
Our neighborhood
isn't this county.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.544
Our neighborhood is America,

30:54.579 --> 30:57.118
and America is entirely

30:57.153 --> 31:00.121
the same.

31:00.156 --> 31:02.090
It, it--

31:02.125 --> 31:03.024
We're not.

31:03.060 --> 31:05.588
That's where all
the conflict comes from.

31:05.623 --> 31:08.492
Well, we saw the mountain
on the way in, so.

31:11.233 --> 31:14.630
I guess that
doesn't really help.

31:14.665 --> 31:17.468
At least we know
we're in the same park.

31:21.144 --> 31:22.044
-I will be here--
-No, please,

31:22.079 --> 31:23.012
don't use the stove.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.343
-Don't turn it on.
-No, I would never!

31:24.378 --> 31:25.608
-Okay.
-No, no, no.

31:25.643 --> 31:27.214
I only turn one thing on.

31:29.251 --> 31:30.514
Oh, God!

31:30.549 --> 31:32.648
All right.

31:35.488 --> 31:36.960
Rewind the footage, yeah?

31:36.995 --> 31:38.654
See if we can
spot a landmark.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.931
All right, you know what,
give me the camera!

31:40.966 --> 31:42.097
Give me the camera!

31:45.036 --> 31:47.234
Go! Go!

31:47.269 --> 31:49.533
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

31:49.568 --> 31:51.271
It's broken!

31:51.306 --> 31:53.174
Oh! Go get help!

31:53.209 --> 31:56.980
Go! Go get help!

32:07.652 --> 32:09.322
I lost five pounds!

32:15.066 --> 32:16.098
Ah!

32:16.133 --> 32:18.694
Oh, how did it bruise so fast?

32:18.729 --> 32:20.597
Oh, Godspeed, Jeff.

32:20.632 --> 32:22.236
Godspeed.

32:22.271 --> 32:23.699
Come back with help.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.308
God dammit, Jeff!

32:28.343 --> 32:30.706
Go!

32:30.741 --> 32:32.312
Go!

32:35.680 --> 32:37.383
Ah!

32:37.418 --> 32:38.681
Ugh!

32:42.258 --> 32:43.686
My fondest memory,

32:43.721 --> 32:48.031
uh, is the look on

32:48.066 --> 32:49.758
the kids' eyes

32:49.793 --> 32:53.729
when they see their mom or dad

32:53.764 --> 32:56.435
crossing the finish line

32:56.470 --> 32:59.207
throwing up.

32:59.242 --> 33:01.374
Just the looks on their faces,

33:01.409 --> 33:03.673
they're just like,

33:03.708 --> 33:07.083
"Why is Daddy doing this?"

33:07.118 --> 33:10.086
I was trying to get
a toy of the ground,

33:10.121 --> 33:12.418
and something happened.

33:12.453 --> 33:13.650
I mean, it's fine.

33:13.685 --> 33:17.489
Um, just a little setback.

33:17.524 --> 33:19.359
We can keep going.

33:19.394 --> 33:21.097
Let's keep going.

33:23.299 --> 33:24.694
Ah!

33:27.534 --> 33:30.040
My sister once told me
I was a mistake.

33:30.075 --> 33:32.603
That's hard not to think about.

33:32.638 --> 33:35.342
Other than that,

33:35.377 --> 33:36.772
I guess my pace.

33:36.807 --> 33:39.247
What do you dream of doing?

33:39.282 --> 33:41.183
Oh, I love dreams!

33:41.218 --> 33:44.153
One time, I was dreaming
that I was a kitten,

33:44.188 --> 33:45.682
and I was caught in a field,

33:45.717 --> 33:47.420
and there was this mouse
I was tryin' to get.

33:47.455 --> 33:48.421
And every time
I'd try to get it,

33:48.456 --> 33:50.555
he just ran a little bit
further into the field.

33:50.590 --> 33:52.161
Mm.

33:54.726 --> 33:56.363
I like your place.

34:06.144 --> 34:11.378
just settled down
when you appeared

34:13.349 --> 34:18.517
it made my vision
crystal clear

34:25.394 --> 34:28.164
settle down with you

34:51.222 --> 34:53.321
I don't, I don't understand
young men these days.

34:53.356 --> 34:55.257
Young, young men...

34:58.262 --> 34:59.525
...swiping things.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.263
When I met my husband,

35:01.298 --> 35:05.861
it was at a, at a, um,
mixer thing for our work.

35:05.896 --> 35:07.731
And he said,
"I'm gonna call you."

35:07.766 --> 35:10.833
And he called me 24 times
in the next 24 hours.

35:10.868 --> 35:13.506
That was one time an hour.

35:16.214 --> 35:18.181
I saw his car, and I said,
"Let's get married."

35:18.216 --> 35:19.611
You can't run
behind a woman because

35:19.646 --> 35:22.614
she thinks you're
staring at her ass.

35:22.649 --> 35:25.683
But then, you can't
run in front of her

35:25.718 --> 35:28.620
because she's
starin' at your ass.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.625
Always go 50/50 on a check.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.264
That's cool now.

35:35.299 --> 35:38.729
Unless it's your birthday,
then, like,

35:38.764 --> 35:40.401
someone else's problem.

35:40.436 --> 35:42.832
Where they take the spaghetti

35:42.867 --> 35:44.306
and then they meet
in the middle, and they kiss,

35:44.341 --> 35:45.670
they spaghetti kiss.

35:45.705 --> 35:46.671
It doesn't happen also because

35:46.706 --> 35:49.377
no one orders a plate
of spaghetti to share.

35:49.412 --> 35:51.346
Like, you'd each have
your own plate of spaghetti,

35:51.381 --> 35:53.744
so it doesn't work.

35:53.779 --> 35:54.943
It doesn't work like that.

35:54.978 --> 35:56.615
Ugh!

35:56.650 --> 35:59.717
No setbacks.

35:59.752 --> 36:03.259
Boston,

36:03.294 --> 36:05.327
here I come!

36:11.368 --> 36:12.598
Hope you're ready
for me, Boston,

36:12.633 --> 36:14.930
'cause I'm comin' with a full,

36:14.965 --> 36:16.503
full head of steam.

36:22.313 --> 36:23.510
Oh, no.

36:23.545 --> 36:24.841
Michael!

36:27.714 --> 36:29.615
I'm goin' crazy, man.

36:29.650 --> 36:32.222
I feel like a Nike lab rat.

36:32.257 --> 36:34.257
As we all know, Nike is,

36:34.292 --> 36:38.261
uh, the famous Greek
goddess of victory.

36:38.296 --> 36:41.594
I am designing the Achilles,

36:41.629 --> 36:43.794
the famous Trojan war hero.

36:43.829 --> 36:45.895
That's, that's not
a desired effect.

36:45.930 --> 36:47.765
Some people have insoles.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.536
I mean, these
are just out-soles.

36:49.571 --> 36:51.670
The glue still
needs to dry a little bit,

36:51.705 --> 36:52.935
or I think it's too dry.

36:52.970 --> 36:54.937
Just gonna stretch it down.

36:54.972 --> 36:57.577
Just takes about, you know,

36:57.612 --> 36:58.842
three or four hours.

36:58.877 --> 37:00.844
The Achilles.

37:00.879 --> 37:02.747
Rah, Trojan war!

37:02.782 --> 37:04.980
You've gotta wear shoes
to get by in life.

37:05.015 --> 37:07.686
Have you ever walked down
a street without your shoes on?

37:07.721 --> 37:08.885
It hurts!

37:08.920 --> 37:10.854
Oh! Ow! Oh!

37:10.889 --> 37:11.723
Why are you sitting down?

37:11.758 --> 37:12.823
Jeff, get up.

37:12.858 --> 37:13.524
We're not staying long.

37:13.559 --> 37:14.990
Get up, we're running here.

37:15.025 --> 37:16.530
Ah!

37:16.565 --> 37:17.663
We're running,
come on, let's go.

37:21.471 --> 37:23.669
No, I'm fine.

37:23.704 --> 37:25.374
It's not that bad.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.575
It's--You think this is bad.

37:36.750 --> 37:40.048
Ah! Ah!

37:44.593 --> 37:46.560
Running has

37:46.595 --> 37:49.057
probably only negative effects.

37:49.092 --> 37:51.301
A healthy run would be like,

37:51.336 --> 37:52.896
"Oh, my bus!"

37:52.931 --> 37:54.997
We should get back
out there soon, I just,

37:55.032 --> 37:56.768
I just got, I think I have
a rock in my shoe.

37:56.803 --> 37:58.506
Not even a rock,
probably like a pebble.

37:58.541 --> 38:01.608
I'll just take my shoe off,
and get the pebble outta there.

38:01.643 --> 38:04.314
Oh!

38:04.349 --> 38:05.414
Oh!

38:05.449 --> 38:06.646
Right there, that was the one,

38:06.681 --> 38:09.517
that was the culprit, so.

38:09.552 --> 38:10.881
That's the one.

38:10.916 --> 38:11.783
Ow!

38:13.083 --> 38:15.490
It's an old evolutionary tool

38:15.525 --> 38:18.592
that was used to use
to run from wild animals.

38:18.627 --> 38:21.430
I don't see any wild animals.

38:21.465 --> 38:24.631
Why? 'Cause they're
all in the zoo.

38:24.666 --> 38:26.435
Ow!

38:26.470 --> 38:29.097
Ow!

38:31.607 --> 38:35.675
The wall is, uh,
one of the things that you

38:35.710 --> 38:38.777
experience when you are--

38:38.812 --> 38:41.747
I don't know.

38:41.782 --> 38:44.552
I don't know what the wall is.

38:44.587 --> 38:47.687
The wall is like, uh,
an electric fence.

38:49.856 --> 38:51.922
You think it's gonna
hurt too bad to go through...

38:53.893 --> 38:55.926
...but you don't know
'till you get to the other side.

38:55.961 --> 38:58.797
What do I do?
The wall, the wall marathon?

38:58.832 --> 39:01.437
Will that Google get me
what I'm lookin' for?

39:01.472 --> 39:03.472
You could just
tell me what it is.

39:03.507 --> 39:04.770
The wall's not real.

39:04.805 --> 39:07.377
It's a self-imposed
mental block...

39:09.073 --> 39:10.743
...like menopause.

39:10.778 --> 39:13.009
I hit a wall every day.

39:13.044 --> 39:14.549
I am a mother.

39:14.584 --> 39:16.078
How to beat the wall.

39:16.113 --> 39:17.453
Hit the wall,

39:17.488 --> 39:19.015
understanding
why you hit the wall.

39:19.050 --> 39:20.654
The wall?

39:20.689 --> 39:22.051
The wall is systemic racism.

39:23.791 --> 39:25.120
Is it like a block?

39:25.155 --> 39:27.595
I got it, it's like
a marathon block.

39:27.630 --> 39:29.630
It's like you can't,
it's like when you hit the wall,

39:29.665 --> 39:31.929
you're like, "Ugh,
I can't run anymore!"

39:31.964 --> 39:34.030
I hit that wall
when I got the packet,

39:34.065 --> 39:36.505
so we're past my wall.

39:38.476 --> 39:40.135
Well, I don't know
what the future holds,

39:40.170 --> 39:42.511
except the marathon.

39:42.546 --> 39:45.008
But, yeah, yeah,
I could see myself with Ben.

39:48.046 --> 39:52.081
When you marry someone, you,

39:52.116 --> 39:55.821
you share something that you
don't have with anyone else.

39:55.856 --> 39:57.856
And so,
there's definitely, uh,

39:57.891 --> 40:01.728
a part of me that, uh,

40:01.763 --> 40:04.830
would definitely want
to have her back

40:04.865 --> 40:05.731
in my life.

40:05.766 --> 40:08.097
Ryan walked in on me
cheating on him...

40:08.132 --> 40:10.066
twice.

40:10.101 --> 40:12.167
That was a rough week.

40:12.202 --> 40:15.203
I have a lot of regrets
about that relationship.

40:15.238 --> 40:17.711
We were married two years.

40:17.746 --> 40:19.042
The second time he caught me,

40:19.077 --> 40:20.813
he just turned and ran.

40:20.848 --> 40:22.518
He kept running.

40:22.553 --> 40:25.719
I wanted to chase
after him, but--

40:25.754 --> 40:26.887
Do you know what a sex swing is?

40:26.922 --> 40:28.854
-Let's just put it this way.
-Oh, this is serious.

40:28.889 --> 40:30.922
Life is a race,

40:30.957 --> 40:32.759
and one of the reasons
I quit running

40:32.794 --> 40:34.189
is because I feel like,

40:34.224 --> 40:38.127
um, we're not all starting
from the same place.

40:38.162 --> 40:39.964
Mm.

40:39.999 --> 40:42.835
The finish line
is a straight line,

40:42.870 --> 40:44.837
but the starting line,
no one talks about that.

40:44.872 --> 40:46.542
The starting line is,

40:46.577 --> 40:49.644
is an, is an uneven line,
and sometimes

40:49.679 --> 40:50.744
the line is even,

40:50.779 --> 40:52.108
it's not even how close it is.

40:52.143 --> 40:53.846
Sometimes the line is lower,

40:53.881 --> 40:56.651
and people have to
climb out of a hole to start.

40:56.686 --> 40:59.984
Not even just that they're back.

41:00.019 --> 41:01.656
Black!

41:02.824 --> 41:04.626
Black!

41:04.661 --> 41:05.990
I like Black people!

41:06.025 --> 41:07.761
Okay, you can say it softer.

41:07.796 --> 41:09.829
I'm sorry.

41:09.864 --> 41:13.063
A felony jaywalking.

41:13.098 --> 41:14.669
Ben?

41:14.704 --> 41:17.507
No.

41:17.542 --> 41:19.135
Nope. I don't know Ben.

41:19.170 --> 41:21.104
I would like to first say
thank you

41:21.139 --> 41:24.745
and I would also
like to propose a toast.

41:24.780 --> 41:26.813
I'm not toasting!
I'm not toasting!

41:26.848 --> 41:31.015
I don't like you! Sit down!

41:31.050 --> 41:32.082
-Oh my god.
-Ben!

41:32.117 --> 41:33.787
I got it, I got it.

41:41.126 --> 41:42.928
You have to trust your daughter.

41:42.963 --> 41:46.030
I have a ring.

41:46.065 --> 41:49.638
-My parents are real people.
-This is not for the camera.

41:49.673 --> 41:52.036
Please, they're confused
and they don't want to--

41:52.071 --> 41:54.907
Will you marry me?

41:54.942 --> 41:57.140
Oh my god.

41:57.175 --> 42:00.275
that's the truth

42:00.310 --> 42:03.586
to brush your tooth

42:03.621 --> 42:04.983
The only thing
I could do for her

42:05.018 --> 42:08.657
is get my pistol
and put a hole--

42:08.692 --> 42:12.661
-Dad, do not, please.
-Can I have the mashed potatoes

42:12.696 --> 42:14.157
-perhaps?
-Yeah, yeah.

42:14.192 --> 42:15.829
-I'm so sorry, okay.
-Careful, they're hot.

42:15.864 --> 42:16.995
Yes of course.

42:17.030 --> 42:18.227
-Okay, okay, sorry.
-Ah!

42:18.262 --> 42:20.097
-Careful.
-Yup, I get it.

42:25.038 --> 42:26.202
I don't think that's helping.

42:26.237 --> 42:27.742
He's just getting more...

42:28.877 --> 42:30.140
...pumped up.

42:30.175 --> 42:31.174
What else do we do?

42:31.209 --> 42:33.946
I don't know what else to do.

42:33.981 --> 42:36.619
No, there's no banana thing.

42:36.654 --> 42:39.919
He's just like--
Ben, are you okay?

42:39.954 --> 42:43.626
-Ben? Ben?
-Let him choke.

42:43.661 --> 42:45.991
-Ugh.
-Oh god.

42:46.026 --> 42:47.861
Ben!

42:47.896 --> 42:49.764
-Dad, I'm so sorry.
-I am so sorry, sir.

42:49.799 --> 42:51.931
Dad, I am so sorry.

42:51.966 --> 42:55.264
What is wrong with you?
Was that real?

42:55.299 --> 42:59.169
-You just spit your own--
-I am so sorry.

42:59.204 --> 43:03.140
Honey, honey,
can I see the ring?

43:03.175 --> 43:06.209
-It's really pretty honey.
-Show you mother the ring.

43:06.244 --> 43:09.278
If one more goddamn banana walks
through that front door--

43:14.054 --> 43:16.758
I Ran With the Devil.

43:16.793 --> 43:17.990
Yah!

43:18.025 --> 43:19.860
We got into some trouble
with some groups

43:19.895 --> 43:23.226
who thought that
it promoted Satanism but...

43:23.261 --> 43:24.865
you know...

43:24.900 --> 43:27.362
I think we invite
all people to run.

43:27.397 --> 43:30.640
We do have a few Satanist
who run in the marathon.

43:30.675 --> 43:34.974
They're very nice people.

43:35.009 --> 43:36.272
Did it all myself.

43:36.307 --> 43:41.409
So these are all,
you know, triple XL.

43:41.444 --> 43:43.180
Um.

43:43.215 --> 43:44.313
But I--

43:44.348 --> 43:47.382
Oh, sorry.

43:47.417 --> 43:50.286
Hold on one sec,
I need to take this.

43:50.321 --> 43:52.024
Hey.

43:52.059 --> 43:54.125
This is a pleasant surprise.

43:54.160 --> 43:56.193
How you are?

44:00.100 --> 44:05.202
Did you interview my wife!

44:05.237 --> 44:06.069
Get back here!

44:06.105 --> 44:08.304
-Cramp! Cramp! Ah, ah.
-Oh god, okay.

44:08.339 --> 44:10.273
Okay, just let it go,
just let it down.

44:10.308 --> 44:12.781
My times have slowed a little.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.343
It's common.

44:14.378 --> 44:16.378
Quit.

44:16.413 --> 44:19.084
Just quit.

44:25.422 --> 44:27.763
Don't you have
this shot already?

44:27.798 --> 44:30.997
Last year we have a picture of a
running crossing a finish line.

44:31.032 --> 44:33.736
This year, um...

44:33.771 --> 44:35.969
this year we got

44:36.004 --> 44:37.938
a couple of MMA fighters

44:37.973 --> 44:40.039
pounding on each other.

44:40.074 --> 44:44.274
Um, we have this guy
pinning this guy down

44:44.309 --> 44:46.342
and he's about to give him
a good old wallop.

44:46.377 --> 44:48.245
No, no it's non-refundable.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.346
Um.

44:50.381 --> 44:53.250
Uh and you know...

44:53.285 --> 44:55.417
we got a bunch of them so.

44:55.452 --> 45:01.060
It's kind of what
we've got to work with.

45:01.095 --> 45:03.865
So, err.

45:03.900 --> 45:07.264
Poom, poom, poom,
Devil's Canyon.

45:07.299 --> 45:10.234
I ran with the devil, mm!

45:10.269 --> 45:12.236
I think it works.

45:12.271 --> 45:14.238
Momma! Momma!

45:14.273 --> 45:16.911
Momma, momma, momma.

45:16.946 --> 45:17.912
Say momma.

45:17.947 --> 45:20.211
Say momma.

45:23.084 --> 45:24.413
I don't want to be--

45:24.448 --> 45:29.759
Jeff, get back!

45:29.794 --> 45:31.519
I don't want to be
in a documentary

45:31.554 --> 45:33.961
about running a marathon
if I can't run in the marathon.

45:33.996 --> 45:35.292
It's embarrassing.

45:35.327 --> 45:37.129
Can I at least
get a new camera man?

45:37.164 --> 45:39.296
No, is there a problem?

45:39.331 --> 45:42.002
No, he's just--he's just Jeff.

45:42.037 --> 45:43.806
That's the thing about him,
he's very duplicitous.

45:43.841 --> 45:46.809
He's able to lie,
he's like a chameleon.

45:46.844 --> 45:49.108
Well intentioned simpleton.

45:49.143 --> 45:50.879
He spit on a nun the other day.

45:50.914 --> 45:52.947
I mean, whether you decide to
get me a new camera man or not,

45:52.982 --> 45:55.048
I think you should,
I think you should

45:55.083 --> 45:56.511
based on what I've told you.

45:56.546 --> 45:58.546
It's one of my favorite parts.

45:58.581 --> 46:01.791
Is the design,
the swag, the stuff.

46:01.826 --> 46:04.959
It's all about--it's--I mean,
it's about the people

46:04.994 --> 46:06.455
but it's mostly about the stuff.

46:06.490 --> 46:08.798
Stay outside, I'm having
a conversation right now.

46:08.833 --> 46:10.360
It's private.

46:10.395 --> 46:11.559
Staying out there.

46:11.594 --> 46:13.968
He pilfered some
of my silverware.

46:14.003 --> 46:15.332
We were trying to do something

46:15.367 --> 46:18.005
and there was this jingling that
we heard

46:18.040 --> 46:21.173
and it ended up being
a bunch of forks and knives.

46:21.208 --> 46:22.812
It was actually
my wedding silverware

46:22.847 --> 46:25.177
which is very dear to me
because obviously,

46:25.212 --> 46:27.080
I've been through a lot.

46:27.115 --> 46:30.149
I've been divorced
and it still means a lot to me.

46:30.184 --> 46:32.822
That silverware is a family--
a family heirloom.

46:32.857 --> 46:34.219
Goddammit Jeff!

46:34.254 --> 46:35.385
Goddammit!

46:35.420 --> 46:36.991
I'm secretary at a law firm.

46:37.026 --> 46:39.554
Uh, Rodrigues,
Rodrigues and Rodrigues

46:39.589 --> 46:42.128
but my boss,
Rodrigues numero dos

46:42.163 --> 46:47.199
said that he would pay
for my law school if I got in.

46:47.234 --> 46:49.399
His wife had a stroke
during a turkey trot

46:49.434 --> 46:52.105
so he's inspired by my
"brave stance

46:52.140 --> 46:55.405
against long distance running."

47:10.422 --> 47:12.961
How's Abby doing?
Is she okay?

47:12.996 --> 47:14.391
Seems like we got an empty nest.

47:14.426 --> 47:15.865
We're all clear here.

47:17.902 --> 47:19.495
Oh, oh! Get down.

47:19.530 --> 47:20.936
Get down everybody!

47:20.971 --> 47:21.871
Get down!

47:28.143 --> 47:30.407
I killed a man once.

47:30.442 --> 47:33.410
I slit his throat
from ear to ear.

47:33.445 --> 47:36.248
And then I realized
it wasn't a man at all

47:36.283 --> 47:39.053
but an animal.

47:39.088 --> 47:40.318
It's okay, it's just one-way.

47:40.353 --> 47:41.286
He can't hear me.

47:44.489 --> 47:46.060
Oh.

47:54.169 --> 47:56.103
I'm real worried okay.

47:58.371 --> 48:00.239
This is a marathon documentary
footage.

48:00.274 --> 48:03.275
I, Ryan O'Brien have taken over
principle photography.

48:03.310 --> 48:06.476
If you notice a strong uptick
in the quality of footage

48:06.511 --> 48:08.577
at this point of the film,

48:08.612 --> 48:10.348
that is to be expected.

48:10.383 --> 48:11.448
I'm going to be sharing entries

48:11.483 --> 48:13.516
from my running diary.

48:13.551 --> 48:16.420
This is a great way
to chart your goals,

48:16.455 --> 48:18.092
keep track of injuries,

48:18.127 --> 48:19.456
hold yourself accountable.

48:19.491 --> 48:21.128
"Take a look back
at your training logs

48:21.163 --> 48:23.031
to remind yourself that
you've done everything possible

48:23.066 --> 48:25.693
to prepare,
the race is the run part

48:25.728 --> 48:28.630
where you get to see the hard
work pay off, enjoy it."

48:28.665 --> 48:30.170
Okay, well.

48:30.205 --> 48:31.402
This is one of my favorite
quotes

48:31.437 --> 48:33.602
from Prefontaine.

48:33.637 --> 48:36.506
The suicide pace
is my favorite pace.

48:36.541 --> 48:40.378
And today seems
like a good day to die.

48:40.413 --> 48:42.677
Shareef, what's your favorite
running quote?

48:42.712 --> 48:45.955
When you put the cleats on,
make sure they fit.

48:45.990 --> 48:48.089
Ugh, ah.

48:48.124 --> 48:50.718
Oh god.

48:50.753 --> 48:53.226
Just in time for
a little feetsy massage.

48:53.261 --> 48:54.161
No.

48:57.001 --> 48:59.562
Ow, just let it go,
just let it go.

48:59.597 --> 49:02.103
Oh my god, oh my god!

49:02.138 --> 49:06.536
Ugh!

49:06.571 --> 49:07.604
I mean, define "Enjoy."

49:07.639 --> 49:10.177
Does anybody enjoy anything
that they do really?

49:10.212 --> 49:13.510
I mean, you know,
you have to endure somedays.

49:13.545 --> 49:16.051
Somedays are better than others.

49:16.086 --> 49:19.252
Some days you just want to like,

49:19.287 --> 49:24.356
you know,
take a sawed-off shotgun and...

49:24.391 --> 49:25.753
and just go shooting
at a shooting range.

49:25.788 --> 49:28.756
I mean, you know,
that's all I would do with that.

49:28.791 --> 49:30.362
Um.

49:30.397 --> 49:32.430
And that's a good day.

49:34.764 --> 49:37.567
Ow, fuck.

49:37.602 --> 49:42.044
Ugh, god.

49:42.079 --> 49:43.639
I think I'm okay.

49:46.611 --> 49:48.083
Shit.

49:48.118 --> 49:51.152
I won 50 dollars!
I never do this.

49:51.187 --> 49:52.450
I just picked this up
for fun and look at that.

49:52.485 --> 49:54.155
I won 50 bucks.

49:54.190 --> 49:55.354
It's just a scrape.

49:55.389 --> 49:56.718
It's nothing.

49:56.753 --> 49:59.655
It just looks--it looks
worse than it is.

49:59.690 --> 50:02.724
So yeah.

50:02.759 --> 50:04.429
See? Everything's fine.

50:04.464 --> 50:09.269
The badge of motherhood.

50:09.304 --> 50:13.471
Like everyone, I have doubts
and insecurities

50:13.506 --> 50:16.540
and moments of weakness.

50:16.575 --> 50:18.179
When you're trying
to do something great

50:18.214 --> 50:19.708
like break a world record

50:19.743 --> 50:23.778
you just have to work
through those hang-ups.

50:23.813 --> 50:27.551
If it were easy
everyone would run a marathon

50:27.586 --> 50:30.455
dressed as a fruit.

50:30.490 --> 50:31.753
Look back at history.

50:31.788 --> 50:34.228
Say oh, here look at this.

50:34.263 --> 50:36.527
This banana beat
this head of cabbage

50:36.562 --> 50:38.595
with the short legs.

50:38.630 --> 50:43.501
She's running around
in fruit clothes.

50:43.536 --> 50:47.472
They lowered the Boston
qualifying times.

50:47.507 --> 50:53.280
There was an increase
in the number of entries.

50:53.315 --> 50:56.118
Is your flight refundable?

50:56.153 --> 50:59.154
Is my flight refundable?

50:59.189 --> 51:01.684
That's the first question
you have for me?

51:01.719 --> 51:04.093
Not is there anyway
that I can still get in?

51:04.128 --> 51:05.787
It would be like
if my mom died and you asked,

51:05.822 --> 51:08.658
"Can you return the Mother's Day
card you bought?"

51:08.693 --> 51:11.760
You are fucking inconsiderate.
Fuck you, Jeff!

51:11.795 --> 51:15.302
No, I can't return--I can't
get a refund on my flight!

51:15.337 --> 51:17.238
No flights are refundable now.

51:17.273 --> 51:21.770
The airlines are brutal.

51:21.805 --> 51:23.508
-What if...
-Uh-huh?

51:23.543 --> 51:26.115
...you don't run the race

51:26.150 --> 51:28.645
but we watch it?

51:28.680 --> 51:30.416
That sounds like the
most bringing thing

51:30.451 --> 51:32.154
I've ever heard.

51:36.160 --> 51:39.458
You gotta what,
four bedroom house

51:39.493 --> 51:42.329
stucco exterior, I'd say...

51:51.868 --> 51:53.472
It's over, huh?

51:53.507 --> 51:56.310
You gotta keep
firing positive arrows,

51:56.345 --> 51:58.510
-positive arrows.
-Okay, positive arrows.

51:58.545 --> 52:00.380
-Positive.
-Positive arrows.

52:00.415 --> 52:03.284
We probably know

52:03.319 --> 52:09.422
that she's not going to
break the record but...

52:09.457 --> 52:12.392
Oh god, oh thank you, Jeff.

52:13.890 --> 52:17.364
Can I use that footage?

52:17.399 --> 52:19.564
I'd like to see it
before I approve it.

52:19.599 --> 52:21.929
Am I nervous about tomorrow?

52:21.964 --> 52:23.535
No. Hell no.

52:23.570 --> 52:26.340
You know why?

52:26.375 --> 52:28.474
I know my lines, I'm ready.

52:28.509 --> 52:33.182
You don't lose
when there's a script.

52:33.217 --> 52:35.217
-Ben.
-Calling my parents.

52:36.880 --> 52:38.781
Hello, we are not available now.

52:38.816 --> 52:41.454
I'm an optimist but not--

52:41.489 --> 52:44.259
I mean, there's gotta be
a limit to what you, you know.

52:44.294 --> 52:46.459
An optimist but?

52:46.494 --> 52:48.923
Marathon's tomorrow.

52:48.958 --> 52:50.529
God, that came fast.

52:50.564 --> 52:51.860
You're never going to be ready.

52:51.895 --> 52:52.927
You always want more days--

52:52.962 --> 52:56.601
And why is my hand wet?

52:56.636 --> 52:59.439
Michael, did you
spill something here?

53:05.513 --> 53:08.679
What is this?
Tell us what this is.

53:13.884 --> 53:16.786
I can't sleep. I'm too nervous.

53:16.821 --> 53:19.459
I don't know what's gonna
happen tomorrow but

53:19.494 --> 53:23.694
I just gotta hope for the best
and plan for the worst.

53:23.729 --> 53:26.598
I, Shareef Washington,

53:26.633 --> 53:28.699
declare that this is my will.

53:28.734 --> 53:32.472
However, I am obviously
not sound of mind and body

53:32.507 --> 53:36.443
as I'm determined to run
a marathon tomorrow.

53:36.478 --> 53:39.281
In the desert.

53:39.316 --> 53:41.943
With white people.

53:49.854 --> 53:53.328
I want to be alone, Jeff.

53:58.731 --> 54:01.930
in the room

54:05.672 --> 54:09.278
in the room

54:12.613 --> 54:15.383
in the room

54:17.816 --> 54:19.981
ain't long

54:45.613 --> 54:47.877
ain't long

54:53.423 --> 54:54.752
Look at view.

54:54.787 --> 54:55.819
Huh?

54:55.854 --> 54:58.723
Breathtaking, right?

54:58.758 --> 55:02.364
Everything you could ask for.

55:02.399 --> 55:05.499
Okay, we don't need that guy
in the landscape, great.

55:05.534 --> 55:07.028
'Cause I like looking
at pictures of landscapes

55:07.063 --> 55:09.767
but when I'm out here
it's like ugh,

55:09.802 --> 55:14.772
I have to walk all the way
out here to look at it.

55:16.941 --> 55:19.073
I hadn't even looked behind me
until just now.

55:19.108 --> 55:20.976
It's gorgeous, isn't it?

55:21.011 --> 55:23.781
Which one is Devil's Peak?

55:23.816 --> 55:25.387
That one there.

55:25.422 --> 55:27.521
Right there.

55:27.556 --> 55:31.888
Or it could--It might be
that one.

55:31.923 --> 55:35.628
Definitely that one.

55:35.663 --> 55:36.926
Look who decided to show up.

55:36.961 --> 55:38.664
You're 30 minutes late.

55:38.699 --> 55:41.964
Oh sorry, Jeff--Jeff called out.

55:41.999 --> 55:44.670
More like I called him out.

55:44.705 --> 55:46.573
So he's not coming back or?

55:46.608 --> 55:48.135
Did he say any--
did he give a message

55:48.170 --> 55:51.974
to tell me or anything?

55:52.009 --> 55:53.646
Okay, fine, yeah whatever.

55:53.681 --> 55:55.043
Let's just roll.

55:55.078 --> 55:57.012
After a long night

55:57.047 --> 56:00.147
and multiple
running diary entries,

56:00.182 --> 56:05.955
I've decided to attend
the race as uh...

56:05.990 --> 56:09.024
as uh...

56:09.059 --> 56:12.500
spectator.

56:12.535 --> 56:15.129
To support my fellow runners.

56:15.164 --> 56:17.406
I'm sorry, I'm not--
Are you sure you registered?

56:17.441 --> 56:19.507
Yeah, oh,
I just saw it right there.

56:19.542 --> 56:23.412
-Oh there it is.
-Can you do it again?

56:23.447 --> 56:25.711
No, that's...

56:25.746 --> 56:28.450
Thirty minutes late and you
want to get another take.

56:28.485 --> 56:31.178
I'm not a machine, this
is just what I'm going through.

56:31.213 --> 56:35.490
-How do you say that?
-Sha-Reef.

56:35.525 --> 56:36.656
Got it.

56:36.691 --> 56:39.021
-Shareef.
-What?

56:39.056 --> 56:42.398
-Have a great run.
-Here we go.

57:04.719 --> 57:06.081
Ugh.

57:06.116 --> 57:07.588
Ugh.

57:07.623 --> 57:09.117
Ugh.

57:09.152 --> 57:11.185
Ah!

57:11.220 --> 57:12.692
Ah-ha.

57:12.727 --> 57:15.464
What happened?

57:15.499 --> 57:16.795
I fell!

57:16.830 --> 57:20.502
Ugh, ow!

57:20.537 --> 57:21.998
-All right.
-It's the bones, Jenna.

57:22.033 --> 57:25.133
It's the goddamn bones!

57:25.168 --> 57:27.509
-Thank god for all the bananas.
-Cut the shit!

57:27.544 --> 57:29.577
Okay, are--are you
really not running?

57:29.612 --> 57:31.975
Look, I'm only contracted
to do the training, okay.

57:32.010 --> 57:35.616
I'm not gonna run
an actual marathon.

57:35.651 --> 57:38.784
-Ugh.
-Who steals crutches?

57:38.819 --> 57:40.885
Even if they're just laying out.

57:40.920 --> 57:42.623
Who steals them?

57:42.658 --> 57:44.625
I struggle to imagine
that someone

57:44.660 --> 57:47.089
who actually needed them
stole them.

57:47.124 --> 57:48.596
I--I gotta go to Florida.

57:48.631 --> 57:50.125
They want me at the Miami Zoo.

57:50.160 --> 57:51.731
They're opening up
a monkey sanctuary

57:51.766 --> 57:54.096
and Dole wants me
to cut the ribbon.

57:54.131 --> 57:55.537
That's it?

57:55.572 --> 57:58.738
What about Shakespeare?
What about us?

57:58.773 --> 58:03.105
Like if I had left out
like a hat or like a shirt.

58:03.140 --> 58:07.549
Like then if it was gone
I'd be upset but it's on me.

58:07.584 --> 58:10.585
What--what are you even
gonna use a crutch for?

58:10.620 --> 58:15.084
I'm not an actor.

58:15.119 --> 58:17.889
I'm product placement.

58:17.924 --> 58:20.595
Hang on, no, no.

58:20.630 --> 58:24.632
Just go...
just...

58:27.934 --> 58:30.638
It hurts!

58:30.673 --> 58:33.168
It hurts the bones!

58:33.203 --> 58:35.709
The goddamn bones.

58:35.744 --> 58:37.007
A couple of announcements.

58:37.042 --> 58:40.076
All right, wow, great turn out.

58:40.111 --> 58:42.309
Paramedics are on-call
for any injury

58:42.344 --> 58:44.553
but the reception
has been spotty.

58:44.588 --> 58:49.789
So it's best to get hurt
between miles six and thirteen.

58:49.824 --> 58:51.626
Six and thirteen.

58:51.661 --> 58:53.892
Yeah, I really liked her.

58:53.927 --> 58:54.959
Can even say I loved her.

58:54.994 --> 58:57.225
Whatever--whatever that means.

58:57.260 --> 58:59.161
I mean, we were together
for six weeks

58:59.196 --> 59:01.097
which is an eternity
in actor's time, you know.

59:01.132 --> 59:02.230
What will you do with the money?

59:02.265 --> 59:04.001
Hm.

59:04.036 --> 59:06.333
LA baby, should be enough.

59:06.368 --> 59:08.742
-Hey, Benny boy.
-How's it going?

59:08.777 --> 59:10.106
-Hey, good, good.
-Yes!

59:10.141 --> 59:11.844
-I have--I have some great news.
-Yes!

59:11.879 --> 59:13.241
-Yeah?
-I am ready for my check.

59:13.276 --> 59:15.342
Dole's or mine?

59:15.377 --> 59:16.277
What?

59:16.312 --> 59:17.949
You're running the race.

59:17.984 --> 59:19.247
What race? What do you mean?
What does that mean?

59:19.282 --> 59:20.853
Respect the cones everyone.

59:20.888 --> 59:23.317
Please, just have some
respect for the cones.

59:23.352 --> 59:24.857
-Okay.
-I'll be there holding this.

59:24.892 --> 59:29.125
Okay, look for the guy
holding this all right.

59:33.296 --> 59:36.231
Fuck!

59:41.238 --> 59:44.107
Great news, you're up.

59:44.142 --> 59:47.781
Water, it's important
to keep hydrated.

59:47.816 --> 59:51.785
There's, uh,
there's gonna be water every--

59:51.820 --> 59:53.721
I think at least
at the beginning

59:53.756 --> 59:55.019
and at the end of the race

59:55.054 --> 59:56.119
there will be water
for everybody.

59:56.154 --> 59:57.791
There's ' something in this one.

59:57.826 --> 59:59.221
So I'm not gonna--
I won't--I won't--

59:59.256 --> 1:00:04.094
I check these every five minutes
for dust, for mites.

1:00:04.129 --> 1:00:06.393
I had a runner one time
he had a drink of water

1:00:06.428 --> 1:00:08.230
and he swallowed a scorpion.

1:00:08.265 --> 1:00:10.298
How does everybody feel?

1:00:10.333 --> 1:00:13.675
Woo! Yeah!

1:00:13.710 --> 1:00:15.776
Is everybody ready
for a race or what?

1:00:15.811 --> 1:00:20.649
Okay, we have to reserve that
for the start of the race, Eric.

1:00:20.684 --> 1:00:22.849
No, no, I got dreams of my own.

1:00:22.884 --> 1:00:25.379
What? Your dreams are
my dreams, goddammit!

1:00:25.414 --> 1:00:27.656
Oh, fuck you, you do not
deserve this Hamlet book.

1:00:27.691 --> 1:00:30.318
Fucking take off that
banana suit, mother fucker!

1:00:30.353 --> 1:00:31.759
You fucking take it off.

1:00:31.794 --> 1:00:33.321
Any other questions
from anybody?

1:00:33.356 --> 1:00:35.224
What's the marathon
in the metric system?

1:00:35.259 --> 1:00:37.094
Like how many kilometers?

1:00:37.129 --> 1:00:40.097
I don't--I--We're in America
okay.

1:00:40.132 --> 1:00:41.934
We use the American system.

1:00:41.969 --> 1:00:44.101
You might have some
international runners, Ed.

1:00:44.136 --> 1:00:45.971
Okay, any international runners?

1:00:46.006 --> 1:00:47.071
Nope, I hear nothing.

1:00:47.106 --> 1:00:49.337
So 26.2 miles.

1:00:49.372 --> 1:00:50.976
That's what we're sticking by
everybody.

1:00:51.011 --> 1:00:53.176
I--I can't do it.

1:00:53.211 --> 1:00:54.848
Please don't make me do it.

1:00:54.883 --> 1:00:56.311
It might work without
the batteries though.

1:00:56.346 --> 1:00:58.984
It doesn't work without
the batteries, Eric.

1:01:01.285 --> 1:01:03.384
Fuck!

1:01:07.863 --> 1:01:09.390
Ugh!

1:01:09.425 --> 1:01:12.327
Okay, thank you,
thank you so much, Eric.

1:01:12.362 --> 1:01:13.460
-So guys--
-You guys might see

1:01:13.495 --> 1:01:16.166
rabbits on the trail.

1:01:16.201 --> 1:01:17.167
Do you want to stand on here?

1:01:17.202 --> 1:01:18.401
Do you want to stand on the box?

1:01:18.437 --> 1:01:21.039
Do you want to do that--No, no
that was a rhetorical question,

1:01:21.074 --> 1:01:24.878
Eric, the command will be
runners on your mark

1:01:24.913 --> 1:01:26.715
and then I'll sound the air--

1:01:26.750 --> 1:01:28.343
Goddammit Eric.

1:01:28.378 --> 1:01:30.081
No.

1:01:30.116 --> 1:01:35.790
Okay, I'm going to
do the air horn.

1:01:35.825 --> 1:01:38.089
And then the race will start.

1:01:48.068 --> 1:01:51.366
Not one Boston qualifier
in the bunch.

1:01:51.401 --> 1:01:52.466
Thought this was a race.

1:01:52.501 --> 1:01:54.303
This looks like a support group

1:01:54.338 --> 1:01:56.338
for people with
muscular atrophy.

1:01:56.373 --> 1:01:58.439
What was there a sale
on workout gear?

1:01:58.474 --> 1:02:00.914
This looks more like
a potato sac race.

1:02:00.949 --> 1:02:02.311
Today's the big day.

1:02:02.346 --> 1:02:04.511
What we've all been waiting for.

1:02:04.546 --> 1:02:08.317
Netflix releases
Season Two of Benched.

1:02:08.352 --> 1:02:10.858
A true story
of a pro football player

1:02:10.893 --> 1:02:12.288
turned trial lawyer.

1:02:12.323 --> 1:02:14.895
Fifteenth annual
Devil's Canyon Marathon.

1:02:14.930 --> 1:02:17.260
-Woo!
-With our brand new arch

1:02:17.295 --> 1:02:19.196
this year, how about it huh?

1:02:19.231 --> 1:02:20.967
All right, let's count it down.

1:02:21.002 --> 1:02:23.233
-Five--
-Three--No, no, no.

1:02:23.268 --> 1:02:24.498
You never--you never start
from five.

1:02:24.533 --> 1:02:25.939
You always start from three.

1:02:25.974 --> 1:02:27.303
-It's always three.
-Why three?

1:02:27.338 --> 1:02:30.042
-Three!
-Three.

1:02:30.077 --> 1:02:31.538
Two--okay.

1:02:31.573 --> 1:02:33.177
Ugh.

1:02:33.212 --> 1:02:36.114
Let the marathon begin!

1:02:36.149 --> 1:02:39.348
Three, two, one!

1:02:39.383 --> 1:02:40.415
Oh, is it supposed to do that?

1:02:40.450 --> 1:02:41.383
No, no, no, it's coming down.

1:02:41.418 --> 1:02:42.516
It's coming down.

1:02:42.551 --> 1:02:45.057
Hold it back up, hold on.

1:02:45.092 --> 1:02:46.058
-No, no, no.
-You're not doing good.

1:02:46.093 --> 1:02:47.059
-Don't--
-No, no, no, no.

1:02:47.094 --> 1:02:48.159
Get back on this side.

1:02:48.194 --> 1:02:49.127
No, no, no.

1:02:49.162 --> 1:02:51.360
Okay, go! Go, go everyday!

1:02:51.395 --> 1:02:53.032
It's time to go.

1:02:53.067 --> 1:02:55.936
Watch your head,
watch your head!

1:02:55.971 --> 1:02:56.937
Timer, timer, timer.

1:02:56.972 --> 1:02:58.840
Do the timer.

1:02:58.875 --> 1:03:01.205
Yay!

1:03:11.118 --> 1:03:13.382
Most participants
are in so much pain

1:03:13.417 --> 1:03:18.123
that they forget to appreciate
their surroundings.

1:03:18.158 --> 1:03:19.993
So I remind them.

1:03:20.028 --> 1:03:22.160
You're not even looking!
You're missing it!

1:03:22.195 --> 1:03:25.262
It's like you're running through
a Monet landscape, you idiot!

1:03:25.297 --> 1:03:28.364
Do you hate nature?

1:03:28.399 --> 1:03:29.970
What's wrong with you.

1:03:30.005 --> 1:03:34.436
Assault and battery,
we'll kill them too.

1:03:34.471 --> 1:03:37.076
I paid 35 dollars to be in this,
I get a shirt.

1:03:37.111 --> 1:03:39.276
It's kind of like a reward
for finishing the race.

1:03:39.311 --> 1:03:40.607
I can't just give you
a tee shirt.

1:03:40.642 --> 1:03:42.180
-I'm on that list.
-I don't want to hurt

1:03:42.215 --> 1:03:43.247
an injured person.

1:03:43.282 --> 1:03:44.919
You're not getting a shirt!

1:03:44.954 --> 1:03:46.855
They're for race finishers!

1:04:05.304 --> 1:04:06.435
Okay, come on.

1:04:06.470 --> 1:04:08.173
Come on.

1:04:08.208 --> 1:04:09.977
Do you run?

1:04:10.012 --> 1:04:12.540
Oh no, no, I don't run.

1:04:12.575 --> 1:04:15.213
Never have never will.

1:04:21.925 --> 1:04:24.519
-Oh hey!
-You cut the course.

1:04:24.554 --> 1:04:27.258
What? No, Jenna,
that is in the past.

1:04:27.293 --> 1:04:29.029
Okay? This is the now.

1:04:29.064 --> 1:04:30.492
-Mile 12.
-Mile 4.

1:04:30.527 --> 1:04:31.526
What?

1:04:31.561 --> 1:04:33.033
Fuck! Fuck!

1:04:33.068 --> 1:04:34.100
I gotta finish this race.

1:04:34.135 --> 1:04:35.200
For Dole?

1:04:35.235 --> 1:04:38.940
No, not for Dole.

1:04:38.975 --> 1:04:40.238
For the money.

1:04:40.273 --> 1:04:41.338
For you.

1:04:41.373 --> 1:04:42.669
For the money and you.

1:04:42.704 --> 1:04:44.275
It's close, 50/50 I don't know.

1:04:44.310 --> 1:04:46.475
I can't have you running
with me, okay.

1:04:46.510 --> 1:04:48.642
You can run next to me
but you gotta keep up--

1:04:48.677 --> 1:04:53.350
-Race yah!
-Shit.

1:04:53.385 --> 1:04:55.583
You run ugly.

1:04:55.618 --> 1:04:57.651
Slow down!

1:04:57.686 --> 1:04:59.587
Slow down!

1:04:59.622 --> 1:05:03.459
Ugh, ugh god.

1:05:03.494 --> 1:05:05.230
You have to put a lot
of pressure on yourself.

1:05:05.265 --> 1:05:07.100
What's a race without water?

1:05:07.135 --> 1:05:08.398
They wouldn't finish
is my point.

1:05:08.433 --> 1:05:10.169
They'd end up--

1:05:10.204 --> 1:05:12.237
the whole goddamn desert
would be full of bodies

1:05:12.272 --> 1:05:15.108
if it weren't for me,
if you really think about it.

1:05:15.143 --> 1:05:17.572
Just CGI my legs.

1:05:17.607 --> 1:05:19.541
-It's a real race, Ben.
-Ugh.

1:05:19.576 --> 1:05:22.181
May the record reflect
that I hold the record

1:05:22.216 --> 1:05:24.117
for passing touchdowns.

1:05:41.169 --> 1:05:44.973
Hey, can you go get me a water?

1:05:56.382 --> 1:05:59.218
Water, water, baby.

1:05:59.253 --> 1:06:04.091
Grab it and go, grab it
and go baby.

1:06:04.126 --> 1:06:07.655
Hey, baby.

1:06:07.690 --> 1:06:10.031
Look, if people
are hydrated that's--

1:06:10.066 --> 1:06:12.066
then my--there's
a whole lot less work

1:06:12.101 --> 1:06:15.432
that I need to do
and if my job's done...

1:06:15.467 --> 1:06:18.600
I'm happy, I don't even...

1:06:18.635 --> 1:06:20.239
don't even need to be there.

1:06:20.274 --> 1:06:22.340
-Just carry me.
-No, no Ben!

1:06:22.375 --> 1:06:24.045
I'm not carrying you.

1:06:24.080 --> 1:06:26.179
I carried you through
this whole process.

1:06:26.214 --> 1:06:30.645
Ugh.

1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:31.778
Oh no.

1:06:31.813 --> 1:06:33.120
Oh no.

1:06:33.155 --> 1:06:35.584
Oh.

1:06:35.619 --> 1:06:37.058
Keep going.

1:06:37.093 --> 1:06:38.224
Keep going.

1:06:38.259 --> 1:06:39.654
Go long.

1:06:39.689 --> 1:06:43.790
How about 15 years long?

1:06:43.825 --> 1:06:45.297
-Fuck you!
-Ben, come on!

1:06:45.332 --> 1:06:48.630
-You fucking bitch!
-Ben!

1:06:48.665 --> 1:06:51.072
It's just a runner, Ben.

1:06:51.107 --> 1:06:53.140
He's not even in costume.

1:06:53.175 --> 1:06:55.406
I don't remember
getting a water.

1:06:55.441 --> 1:06:56.770
I went to get it.

1:06:56.805 --> 1:06:57.771
-Yeah, yeah.
-I did.

1:06:57.806 --> 1:06:59.509
Yeah what happened?

1:06:59.544 --> 1:07:00.510
I can get you another one.

1:07:00.545 --> 1:07:03.183
No, I'm over it.

1:07:08.421 --> 1:07:09.816
Yay, Momma, you run!

1:07:09.851 --> 1:07:13.061
Do the best, you're number one!

1:07:13.096 --> 1:07:14.260
Hey!

1:07:14.295 --> 1:07:17.065
Hi.

1:07:17.100 --> 1:07:18.726
-Abby?
-I'm so happy.

1:07:18.761 --> 1:07:20.530
-Abby, you okay?
-I'm so happy.

1:07:20.565 --> 1:07:23.500
Sweetheart?

1:07:23.535 --> 1:07:27.405
Jenna!

1:07:27.440 --> 1:07:29.110
Jenna!

1:07:29.145 --> 1:07:32.146
What happened to your number?

1:07:32.181 --> 1:07:35.644
Are you limping?
Or is that how you really run?

1:07:35.679 --> 1:07:42.090
I forgot to register.

1:07:42.125 --> 1:07:43.091
I forgot.

1:07:43.126 --> 1:07:44.719
Oh sweetie, I'm so sorry.

1:07:44.754 --> 1:07:46.622
And that doesn't even matter.

1:07:46.657 --> 1:07:51.462
Here.

1:07:51.497 --> 1:07:53.629
That's Gatorade.

1:07:53.664 --> 1:07:57.831
I filled up Miles' bottle
with Gatorade?

1:07:57.866 --> 1:08:00.273
Ugh.

1:08:00.308 --> 1:08:03.639
Why would you have a marathon
in the desert?

1:08:03.674 --> 1:08:05.806
-Momma.
-What?

1:08:05.841 --> 1:08:10.580
-Momma.
-You say Momma?

1:08:10.615 --> 1:08:12.450
Did you say Momma?

1:08:12.485 --> 1:08:14.848
-Did he just say Momma?
-He says it all the time.

1:08:14.883 --> 1:08:17.554
He actually called our mailman
Momma the other day.

1:08:17.589 --> 1:08:19.589
-But I mean.
-He does?

1:08:19.624 --> 1:08:23.725
No, no, this is--he called
the fridge Momma.

1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:25.331
-But--
-He thinks about me?

1:08:25.366 --> 1:08:26.365
He thinks about you.

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:28.169
Honey, I can do this.

1:08:28.204 --> 1:08:28.895
You're running the race?

1:08:28.930 --> 1:08:30.138
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:08:30.173 --> 1:08:31.799
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1:08:31.834 --> 1:08:33.900
I can do this, okay.

1:08:33.935 --> 1:08:35.374
You can do this.

1:08:35.409 --> 1:08:36.705
You can do this, sweetie.

1:08:36.740 --> 1:08:38.575
-Momma.
-Do it, Momma.

1:08:38.610 --> 1:08:40.643
Momma, momma, momma!

1:08:40.678 --> 1:08:45.351
Oh.

1:08:45.386 --> 1:08:49.850
I've made so many mistakes.

1:08:49.885 --> 1:08:51.456
Momma.

1:08:51.491 --> 1:08:53.392
Momma.

1:08:53.427 --> 1:08:55.394
And he's like "I put a bomb
in the finish line

1:08:55.429 --> 1:08:57.495
of your race,
you better watch out."

1:08:57.530 --> 1:08:59.563
And I was like,
"It's our 15th year.

1:08:59.598 --> 1:09:01.235
How could you do that to us?"

1:09:01.270 --> 1:09:02.467
And he's like "I don't care.

1:09:02.502 --> 1:09:04.535
Yeah, I'm gonna bomb it."

1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:32.431
Um, attention everyone.

1:09:32.466 --> 1:09:33.465
Attention.

1:09:33.500 --> 1:09:35.632
Um, nobody panic

1:09:35.667 --> 1:09:39.735
but we've received
a bomb threat.

1:09:39.770 --> 1:09:41.506
It's probably a hoax.

1:09:41.541 --> 1:09:44.509
But if it's not,
then it's a bomb.

1:09:46.315 --> 1:09:50.515
The caller claimed
that the finish line

1:09:50.550 --> 1:09:52.583
is where the bomb's
gonna go off.

1:09:52.618 --> 1:09:56.785
But I'll believe it
when I see it.

1:10:02.826 --> 1:10:05.827
The police are on their way.

1:10:05.862 --> 1:10:08.434
Carry on.

1:10:16.807 --> 1:10:18.609
How are we going
to tell the runners?

1:10:18.644 --> 1:10:19.709
Flare gun?

1:10:19.744 --> 1:10:20.875
Smoke signals?

1:10:20.910 --> 1:10:21.943
I'm really good with fire.

1:10:21.978 --> 1:10:25.517
No one should finish
for another twenty minutes.

1:10:28.049 --> 1:10:31.391
I lost my watch.

1:10:31.426 --> 1:10:32.854
Twenty minutes is so soon.

1:10:32.889 --> 1:10:34.625
Should we be this close?

1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:37.727
You're fine, you're fine,
you're fine where you're at.

1:10:39.665 --> 1:10:41.797
Life or death situation, huh.

1:10:41.832 --> 1:10:44.503
You find out who you truly are.

1:10:54.515 --> 1:10:56.680
Boo.

1:10:56.715 --> 1:10:59.419
Boo.

1:10:59.454 --> 1:11:04.017
You don't need to...

1:11:04.052 --> 1:11:06.426
-Are you okay, Ed?
-I'm fine, I'm just--

1:11:06.461 --> 1:11:07.757
I don't know.

1:11:18.968 --> 1:11:22.068
Is this still enough?

1:11:22.103 --> 1:11:23.839
Yeah, I prefer it to be more out

1:11:23.874 --> 1:11:26.809
so that you're presenting
to the winners.

1:11:26.844 --> 1:11:28.382
Yes, exact--Yes.

1:11:28.417 --> 1:11:30.010
Open, open arms.

1:11:30.045 --> 1:11:32.650
Nobody wants to run
and hug and animal, okay.

1:11:32.685 --> 1:11:34.355
-Am I hugging them?
-Yes.

1:11:34.390 --> 1:11:36.951
You're gonna hug them.

1:11:36.986 --> 1:11:39.756
They are winning,
this is their moment.

1:11:39.791 --> 1:11:41.527
Just give them their moment,
Eric.

1:11:41.562 --> 1:11:43.991
Good lord.

1:11:44.026 --> 1:11:45.762
Hurry up!

1:11:51.704 --> 1:11:52.769
Just start at the beginning.

1:11:52.804 --> 1:11:54.507
Oh, well,
about fifteen years ago

1:11:54.542 --> 1:11:57.378
I decided to start a marathon
here in town because

1:11:57.413 --> 1:11:58.445
we don't--we kind of
have a lack of--

1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:00.876
Let's jump forward just a bit.

1:12:00.911 --> 1:12:02.548
Okay, at the seven year mark
we decided to--

1:12:02.583 --> 1:12:04.517
No, jump forward to today.

1:12:04.552 --> 1:12:06.046
Okay, yeah, I don't know,

1:12:06.081 --> 1:12:09.654
about 20, 35 minutes ago
I received a phone call.

1:12:09.689 --> 1:12:13.625
From this guy who was like,
"Oh, I will put a bomb

1:12:13.660 --> 1:12:16.694
underneath your finish line,
I bombed it.

1:12:16.729 --> 1:12:18.432
I placed it underneath your--"

1:12:18.467 --> 1:12:20.434
He was French?

1:12:20.469 --> 1:12:23.063
I don't know, he just had
a weird sort of voice to him.

1:12:23.098 --> 1:12:26.000
And he was like, "Oh, I put--I
put, you know, bomb

1:12:26.035 --> 1:12:28.805
underneath your--your
finish line."

1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:30.972
Now he's Russian?

1:12:31.007 --> 1:12:33.040
Could've been Franco-Russian,
something.

1:12:33.075 --> 1:12:34.811
I'm not exactly sure.

1:12:44.020 --> 1:12:46.559
That guy Eric.

1:12:46.594 --> 1:12:49.925
Look for a very,
very sad looking

1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:52.796
misshapen individual.

1:12:52.831 --> 1:12:54.534
And you think
he somehow is connected

1:12:54.569 --> 1:12:55.799
to this bomb threat?

1:12:55.834 --> 1:12:57.031
I--You know,
anything is possible.

1:12:57.066 --> 1:12:59.605
But he's just been acting very--

1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:01.673
just he's been
acting really stupid

1:13:01.708 --> 1:13:05.413
and I'm just not sure
that he's really trustworthy.

1:13:05.448 --> 1:13:06.975
All right.

1:13:07.010 --> 1:13:08.009
What's your name?

1:13:08.044 --> 1:13:09.142
-Ed Clap.
-Ed Clap.

1:13:09.177 --> 1:13:12.519
It's one "P."

1:13:15.458 --> 1:13:18.151
Last episode.

1:13:21.497 --> 1:13:24.124
What?

1:13:24.159 --> 1:13:25.631
Turn around!

1:13:25.666 --> 1:13:27.127
There's a bomb!

1:13:27.162 --> 1:13:29.734
-No, no, there's a bomb!
-No, stop!

1:13:29.769 --> 1:13:31.703
There's a bomb!

1:14:30.698 --> 1:14:32.896
Where's everybody at?

1:14:32.931 --> 1:14:36.603
-I don't think it exploded.
-No.

1:14:36.638 --> 1:14:40.035
Because this bush would be gone
if that blew up.

1:14:40.070 --> 1:14:43.841
I can outrun anybody.

1:14:43.876 --> 1:14:47.614
Until they caught me.

1:14:47.649 --> 1:14:50.012
Just about five feet
from where they were.

1:14:50.047 --> 1:14:51.178
Now were are the news vans?

1:14:51.213 --> 1:14:52.817
Oh yeah, there's a bunch.

1:14:52.852 --> 1:14:55.523
-I sent them the other way.
-Wait what?

1:14:55.558 --> 1:14:57.657
Yeah, I'd figure you'd want
to keep this under wraps.

1:14:57.692 --> 1:14:59.186
If word got out this
would be in all the papers.

1:14:59.221 --> 1:15:02.860
No, okay--can you--can you call
them back?

1:15:02.895 --> 1:15:04.059
-Where are--where--
-Oh, they're gone.

1:15:04.094 --> 1:15:05.698
They're gone, they're long gone.

1:15:05.733 --> 1:15:08.569
It was a publicity stunt?

1:15:08.604 --> 1:15:10.197
White people.

1:15:25.247 --> 1:15:29.150
I have to uh, call my mom.

1:15:29.185 --> 1:15:30.218
Hey, mom.

1:15:30.253 --> 1:15:32.054
How much longer do you think
they're gonna be?

1:15:32.089 --> 1:15:33.319
-The runners.
-That's the guy.

1:15:33.354 --> 1:15:36.157
-That's Eric.
-I'll figure it out.

1:15:58.951 --> 1:16:02.084
Ugh, ugh, I did it.

1:16:05.089 --> 1:16:09.630
How does it feel?

1:16:09.665 --> 1:16:10.796
Um.

1:16:10.831 --> 1:16:12.732
Has anyone seen Ben?

1:16:12.767 --> 1:16:15.130
he was having a lot of trouble

1:16:15.165 --> 1:16:17.671
and I don't know if it was
between six and thirteen

1:16:17.706 --> 1:16:20.168
or not so he could
still be out there.

1:16:20.203 --> 1:16:24.942
But he--I left him.

1:16:24.977 --> 1:16:26.372
I had to,
he told me to leave him.

1:16:26.407 --> 1:16:30.343
Jenna!

1:16:30.378 --> 1:16:31.883
Jenna!

1:16:31.918 --> 1:16:33.016
But has anybody seen him?

1:16:33.051 --> 1:16:33.984
Have you guys seen him?

1:16:34.019 --> 1:16:35.381
Did he come through or?

1:16:35.416 --> 1:16:37.086
I mean, he's not gonna--
it's gonna be a while.

1:16:37.121 --> 1:16:40.122
He'll be a while.

1:16:40.157 --> 1:16:42.894
Guys, there's nothing
going on here.

1:16:42.929 --> 1:16:45.226
So.

1:16:45.261 --> 1:16:47.833
We don't need to do this.

1:16:54.006 --> 1:16:56.270
I had a--I had a clear goal.

1:16:56.305 --> 1:16:57.304
I worked hard at it.

1:16:57.339 --> 1:17:00.307
I worked toward it everyday.

1:17:00.342 --> 1:17:02.683
I didn't delineate from my path.

1:17:02.718 --> 1:17:05.114
I tried to be my best self.

1:17:05.149 --> 1:17:06.918
I prayed that
it would come true.

1:17:06.953 --> 1:17:08.788
I sacrificed for it.

1:17:08.823 --> 1:17:10.988
I didn't give way
to distractions

1:17:11.023 --> 1:17:16.257
or temptation
and I still fell far short.

1:17:27.369 --> 1:17:29.138
Can we go eat now?

1:17:29.173 --> 1:17:34.242
I've been on a plane all day.

1:17:34.277 --> 1:17:39.082
My legs are killing me.

1:17:39.117 --> 1:17:40.347
You guys are here?

1:17:44.122 --> 1:17:46.023
You think we would miss this?

1:17:46.058 --> 1:17:47.387
Are you kidding me.

1:17:47.422 --> 1:17:48.729
Did you guys know this?

1:17:48.764 --> 1:17:51.094
Did you know they were coming?

1:17:51.129 --> 1:17:53.899
How you gonna--how you gonna
live, you know?

1:17:53.934 --> 1:17:56.704
Without the...

1:17:59.368 --> 1:18:00.708
What time is is?

1:18:00.743 --> 1:18:05.042
Does anybody know the time?

1:19:52.349 --> 1:19:54.316
So yeah, I guess if I learned
anything from the Marathon

1:19:54.351 --> 1:19:56.153
it's how to hate myself,

1:19:56.188 --> 1:19:58.419
dreams don't come true,

1:19:58.454 --> 1:20:01.026
life has no meaning,

1:20:01.061 --> 1:20:03.556
and that uh,
people cannot be trusted.

1:20:03.591 --> 1:20:05.195
No one can be trusted

1:20:05.230 --> 1:20:07.329
even if you think
you can trust them.

1:20:07.364 --> 1:20:08.561
All right, this is over.

1:20:08.596 --> 1:20:11.333
Oh yeah and I learned
I hate documentaries.

1:20:11.368 --> 1:20:12.939
I hate documentaries.

1:20:12.974 --> 1:20:16.074
So you can, you know,
you can suck it.

1:20:16.109 --> 1:20:17.878
You can all suck it.

1:20:17.913 --> 1:20:21.079
You're just vultures
just praying on my misery.

1:20:21.114 --> 1:20:23.081
So yeah, that's--
If you want to learn--

1:20:23.116 --> 1:20:24.577
You want to know what
I learned from the marathon

1:20:24.612 --> 1:20:28.482
it's that I hate myself,

1:20:28.517 --> 1:20:30.187
dreams don't come true,

1:20:30.222 --> 1:20:32.189
life has no meaning,

1:20:32.224 --> 1:20:34.092
no one can be trusted

1:20:34.127 --> 1:20:37.095
and documentaries...

1:20:37.130 --> 1:20:38.558
suck.

1:20:38.593 --> 1:20:42.067
They're a sadistic,
it's not even an art form.

1:20:42.102 --> 1:20:45.103
You just--just like, oh,
I want to be a film maker

1:20:45.138 --> 1:20:47.875
but I don't know what
to tell a story about.

1:20:47.910 --> 1:20:49.976
Let me just shoot
a bunch of bullshit

1:20:50.011 --> 1:20:52.638
and then somebody else
will cut it all together.

1:20:52.673 --> 1:20:54.409
So yeah,
I think that's what I learned

1:20:54.444 --> 1:20:57.313
from the marathon--
Stop filming me.

1:20:57.348 --> 1:21:00.052
Oh and I learned that wood
is also a terrible crutch.

1:21:00.087 --> 1:21:01.988
This is killing my armpit.

1:21:02.023 --> 1:21:03.957
So yeah, you want to know what
I learned from the marathon

1:21:03.992 --> 1:21:06.223
I guess I'd say it's that, uh,

1:21:06.258 --> 1:21:08.522
it's that I hate myself,

1:21:08.557 --> 1:21:11.129
that dreams don't come true,

1:21:11.164 --> 1:21:13.362
life has no meaning,

1:21:13.397 --> 1:21:15.595
no one can be trusted,

1:21:15.630 --> 1:21:18.466
documentaries fucking blow

1:21:18.501 --> 1:21:21.271
and a two by four
is a terrible thing

1:21:21.306 --> 1:21:23.174
to use as a crutch.

1:21:23.209 --> 1:21:24.670
Oh god, ugh.

1:21:24.705 --> 1:21:26.914
Hey, are you getting
all your footage?

1:21:26.949 --> 1:21:29.345
Ah, I'd hate for you
to help me or anything.

1:21:29.380 --> 1:21:31.985
Hate for you to think of me
as another human being

1:21:32.020 --> 1:21:34.284
who might need
a compassionate hug.

1:21:34.319 --> 1:21:39.289
God as my witness,
I will never run again.
