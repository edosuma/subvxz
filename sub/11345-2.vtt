WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.803
- IN THE CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.836 --> 00:06.207
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.442
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.476 --> 00:10.378
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.411 --> 00:11.779
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.812 --> 00:14.048
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.783
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.057
- HEY!

00:23.091 --> 00:25.126
- SORRY, TORI.
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.061
- THIRD TIME THIS WEEK.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.329
- YOU DON'T WANNA
BE A BITCH TO ME.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.763
- LET ME GO, DENNIS.
[bell dings]

00:29.797 --> 00:31.665
WE HAVE A CUSTOMER.
- SERIOUSLY.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.368
PLAY NICE, 'CAUSE ME
AND THE BOSS ARE TIGHT.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.470
- WHAT'S HE GONNA SAY

00:36.504 --> 00:37.538
WHEN I TELL HIM
YOU LET THE CUSTOMERS

00:37.571 --> 00:40.074
EAT THE MERCHANDISE?

00:40.108 --> 00:42.776
- HEY! PUT THAT BACK!

00:42.810 --> 00:44.478
I'M TALKING TO YOU, KID.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.480
IN HERE, YOU PAY FIRST,
AND THEN EAT!

00:46.514 --> 00:48.649
- [loud gasp]

00:48.682 --> 00:51.252
[whimpering]

00:53.121 --> 00:55.489
- FEMALE, LOOKS
AROUND 10 YEARS OLD.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.225
SEVERE VAGINAL TRAUMA.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.260
HEMATOMAS ON BOTH WRISTS,

00:59.293 --> 01:00.461
PROBABLY FROM
BEING PINNED DOWN.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.096
- YOU RUN A RAPE KIT?
- NOT YET.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.531
WE JUST GOT
THE BLEEDING STOPPED.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.366
BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW
SHE IS DEHYDRATED,

01:05.399 --> 01:06.234
MALNOURISHED,

01:06.267 --> 01:08.436
AND LIMITED ARM ROTATION
MAKES ME THINK

01:08.469 --> 01:10.338
SHE HAS GOT
A BADLY-HEALED BREAK.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.440
- SOME ANIMAL
KEPT HER CAGED UP.

01:12.473 --> 01:15.509
- WELL, GOOD LUCK
FINDING OUT WHO.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.111
POOR THING
WON'T SAY A WORD.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.350
- [gently] HEY THERE.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.817
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

01:26.787 --> 01:28.456
I'M OLIVIA.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.890
THIS IS ELLIOT.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.593
WE'RE POLICE OFFICERS.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.562
I WAS HOPING
THAT YOU COULD TELL US

01:34.595 --> 01:37.298
WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE
YOU WENT INTO THAT STORE.

01:37.331 --> 01:41.235
MIGHT MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

01:41.269 --> 01:44.905
- DID SOMEBODY TELL YOU
NOT TO TALK TO US?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.874
LIKE, MAYBE SOMETHING
BAD WOULD HAPPEN?

01:46.907 --> 01:49.109
WHICH IS NOT TRUE.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.879
- BET YOU HAVE
A REAL PRETTY NAME.

01:51.912 --> 01:55.783
WILL YOU TELL US WHAT IT IS,
SO WE CAN FIND YOUR PARENTS?

01:55.816 --> 01:58.486
I'M SURE THEY'RE
WORRIED SICK ABOUT YOU.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.556
- DR. BERESFORD ASKED ME
TO START THE KIT.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.892
- [gasps]

02:04.925 --> 02:09.163
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
SWEETIE, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

02:09.197 --> 02:11.232
WHAT'S WRONG?

02:11.265 --> 02:14.535
- HE...

02:14.568 --> 02:17.505
HE TOOK PICTURES OF ME.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.763
- SO YOUR LITTLE VICTIM
WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

03:15.796 --> 03:16.897
- LIV POURED ON THE CHARM.

03:16.930 --> 03:17.965
WOULDN'T EVEN
GIVE US HER NAME.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.333
- SHE ONLY SAID
THAT THIS SICK PRICK

03:19.367 --> 03:21.235
TOOK PICTURES OF HER
WHILE HE RAPED HER.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.304
- AND THEN SCARED HER
INTO SILENCE.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.638
- THE RAPE KIT
HAD NOTHING TO SAY, EITHER.

03:24.672 --> 03:25.839
NO FLUIDS, NO FIBERS,

03:25.873 --> 03:26.974
AND NO MATCHES
TO ANY LITTLE GIRLS

03:27.007 --> 03:28.442
AND MISSING PERSONS.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.677
- WHAT KIND OF PARENT

03:29.710 --> 03:31.479
DOESN'T REPORT
THEIR KID MISSING ALL NIGHT?

03:31.512 --> 03:32.480
- ONCE WHO KEEPS 'EM
LOCKED UP IN THE HOME.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.647
I THINK THE DAD'S THE DOER.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.649
FIRST THING'S FIRST.
LET'S I.D. THE GIRL.

03:35.683 --> 03:36.884
- WELL, WE CAN'T
GO TO THE MEDIA.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.520
PERP KNOWS WE'RE ON TO HIM,
HE'S GONNA HEAD TO THE HILLS.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.655
- WELL, A BLEEDING GIRL
COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN VERY FAR

03:41.689 --> 03:42.956
WITHOUT ATTRACTING ATTENTION.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.992
SHE'S GOT TO LIVE
SOMEWHERE NEAR THAT MARKET.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.327
- WELL, MAYBE CENSUS DATA

03:46.360 --> 03:48.596
CAN GIVE US A LEG UP ON IT.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.564
- FEMALE.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.032
10.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.734
NON-HISPANIC CAUCASIAN.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.769
[beeping]

04:01.942 --> 04:03.377
- OKAY, SO THERE'S ONE

04:03.411 --> 04:04.712
IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE
HOUSEHOLDS.

04:04.745 --> 04:08.416
- YOU BETTER GRAB MUNCH AND FIN
AND HIT THE BRICKS.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.351
- SHE DOESN'T LIVE
IN THIS BUILDING.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.752
I WISH SHE DID, THOUGH.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.522
MY CECELIA WOULD HAVE
A GIRL TO PLAY WITH.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.823
- MM, NO.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.325
NEVER SEEN HER.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.560
THIS IS OUR DAUGHTER.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.862
BOB IS UPSTATE,
DROPPING HER OFF AT CAMP.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.598
AND I'M STUCK HOME
WITH KIMBO.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.535
- YOU KNOW, THEY
EAT THOSE THINGS IN PERU.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.902
- NO, SHE'S NOT A MEMBER
OF OUR KIDS CLUB.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.504
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HER
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

04:30.538 --> 04:31.539
- NOT THAT I RECALL.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.641
DID SOMETHING BAD
HAPPEN TO HER?

04:33.674 --> 04:34.875
- SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
LAST NIGHT,

04:34.908 --> 04:36.544
WE BELIEVE SOMEWHERE
NEAR HERE.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.011
- AH, JEEZ.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.747
I WISH I CAN HELP YOU.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.617
HEY, GINA.
YOU EVER SEE THIS GIRL?

04:43.651 --> 04:45.553
- YEAH, LOTS OF TIMES.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.388
- HOW 'BOUT LAST NIGHT
ON THE STREET?

04:47.421 --> 04:49.056
- NO, IN THE DOORWAY.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.425
EVERY TIME I DELIVER
A PIE TO HER FOLKS.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.026
SHE NEVER SAYS ANYTHING.
JUST STARES AT ME.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.362
- WE NEED THE ADDRESS.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.797
- 230 EAST 28TH,
APARTMENT 4B.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.666
- AND YOU'RE SURE
THIS GIRL LIVES THERE?

04:58.699 --> 05:00.100
- YEAH, A BOY TOO.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.469
I'VE HEARD HIS VOICE.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.707
[knock on door]

05:06.740 --> 05:08.909
- NYPD, OPEN UP!

05:08.942 --> 05:10.911
- I CAN HEAR THE TV.

05:10.944 --> 05:11.912
- LET'S GO!
LET'S GO!

05:11.945 --> 05:13.381
WE KNOW YOU'RE HOME.
COME ON.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.516
- DADDY, NO!

05:17.585 --> 05:19.019
HELP ME, MOMMY!

05:21.989 --> 05:25.092
- MR. AND MRS. SAMONSKY,
SHOW YOURSELVES!

05:25.125 --> 05:27.495
- I'LL GO GET HIM.
- YOU GOT HIM LAST TIME.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.829
I'LL GO GET HIM.
I'M ALMOST THERE.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.130
- DON'T FALL.
DON'T LET HIM FALL.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.566
- DON'T LET HIM FALL.
DON'T LET HIM FALL.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.468
- I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING, JEFF.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.103
JEFF, WATCH OUT.
ON YOUR LEFT.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.505
- I SEE IT.
GO FOR CALEB.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.773
I'LL KICK YOUR ASS,

05:39.807 --> 05:41.141
I GOT HIM.
WATCH THIS.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.043
- HANG ON, CALEB!
MOMMY'S COMING!

05:43.076 --> 05:44.878
- HURRY.
CALEB'S HANDS ARE SLIPPING.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.580
- HEY! GET UP!

05:46.614 --> 05:47.848
- AHH, UHH!

05:47.881 --> 05:48.949
- ALL RIGHT, SHUT IT OFF!
GET UP!

05:48.982 --> 05:50.117
- GO ON THE LEFT.
- I KNOW!

05:50.150 --> 05:51.852
I GOT IT!
I'M TRYING.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.487
HANG ON, CALEB!
- JANUS COIN.

05:53.521 --> 05:56.457
GET THE JANUS COIN!
- SHUT UP! I GOT IT!

05:56.490 --> 05:57.725
- WHOA! WHOA!

05:57.758 --> 05:58.792
WHERE THE HELL'D
YOU COME FROM?

05:58.826 --> 06:00.428
- THE REAL WORLD.
JOIN US.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.729
- HELL, NO!
PLUG US BACK IN.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.598
- GET UP!
- HEY, THIS IS LEVEL 20, OKAY?

06:04.632 --> 06:05.666
THIS IS THE KINGDOM
OF GALAGOR!

06:05.699 --> 06:07.435
- AND OUR BOY NEEDS US!

06:07.468 --> 06:08.702
- RIGHT?
THE WAY YOU TREAT KIDS,

06:08.736 --> 06:09.970
HE'S BETTER OFF
IN HIS OWN WORLD.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.138
- MOMMY!

06:11.171 --> 06:14.141
DON'T LET ME DIE!

06:16.577 --> 06:18.512
- ALL RIGHT, CAN YOU
LET ME OUT OF HERE, PLEASE?

06:18.546 --> 06:19.713
I GOTTA GET BACK.

06:19.747 --> 06:20.881
- GAME'S REALLY GOT YOU
BY THE BALLS, HUH?

06:20.914 --> 06:22.916
- NO, NO, NO.
LOOK, I AM NOT AN ADDICT.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.885
- YOU'RE SWEATING,
AND YOU STINK

06:24.918 --> 06:26.420
LIKE YOU HAVEN'T
BATHED IN A MONTH.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.921
YOU'RE A JUNKIE, JEFF.
- NO.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.690
I CAN QUIT ANY TIME I WANT,
ALL RIGHT?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.592
AMBER'S THE ONE
WHO'S GOT THE PROBLEM.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.793
AMBER'S THE PROBLEM.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.463
- ME AND JEFF
MET ONLINE LAST YEAR.

06:35.496 --> 06:39.467
AN XBOX TOURNAMENT
HOSTED OUT OF SOUTH KOREA.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.069
HE HAD THE CUTEST AVATAR.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.671
TURNED OUT HE ONLY LIVED
THREE BLOCKS AWAY.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.607
- WELL...FATE WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.176
- WE STARTED PLAYING
24/7 BACK IN MAY

06:49.209 --> 06:51.178
AFTER I GOT MY SETTLEMENT
FROM THE CITY.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.179
- FOR WHAT?

06:52.212 --> 06:54.214
- AMBER GOT HIT BY A BUS.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.183
WE WERE ON OUR WAY
TO BEST BUY

06:56.216 --> 07:00.053
TO GET IN LINE FOR THE RELEASE
OF THE NEW EVEREARTH.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.489
OH, MAN.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.923
THE SOUND HER HEAD MADE

07:02.956 --> 07:04.992
WHEN IT BOUNCED
OFF THE SIDEWALK.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.895
- IF ONLY YOU FELT THAT KIND OF
PAIN FOR YOUR CHILD.

07:07.928 --> 07:08.962
- OH, NO, CALEB'S
GONNA BE OKAY.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.831
HE'S GOT EXTRA LIVES.

07:10.864 --> 07:14.001
- I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOUR REAL CHILD, JEFF!

07:14.034 --> 07:14.968
YOUR DAUGHTER?

07:15.002 --> 07:16.504
- WHAT, HER?

07:16.537 --> 07:17.638
- YEAH.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.541
- NO, SEE,
ROSE AIN'T MY KID.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.975
OKAY, SHE CALLS ME
DADDY SOMETIMES,

07:22.009 --> 07:24.545
BUT--BUT SOME OTHER DUDE
KNOCKED UP AMBER.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.547
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT MINE.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.414
- SO YOU'RE JUST HER STEPDAD

07:27.447 --> 07:28.916
THAT KEEPS HER
LOCKED UNDER THE STAIRS?

07:28.949 --> 07:31.652
WHO THROWS HER A PIZZA CRUST
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.787
AND THEN, WHEN YOU GET BORED
OF YOUR LITTLE GAME,

07:33.821 --> 07:35.923
YOU GO IN THERE
AND RAPE HER?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.625
- WHAT?

07:37.658 --> 07:38.626
- IF SHE HADN'T
BROKEN FREE LAST NIGHT,

07:38.659 --> 07:39.827
SHE'D BE DEAD SOON.

07:39.860 --> 07:40.861
- WHA...

07:40.894 --> 07:42.496
ROSE ESCAPED?

07:42.530 --> 07:43.564
SHE RAN AWAY?

07:43.597 --> 07:44.665
ARE YOU SAYING
SOMEBODY RAPED HER?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.734
- NO, NOT SOMEBODY, JEFF.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.503
YOU RAPED THE LITTLE GIRL
THAT CALLS YOU DADDY!

07:49.537 --> 07:51.038
- OKAY, WAIT A SECOND.
PAUSE THE GAME.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.508
I HAVEN'T HAD SEX WITH ANYBODY
FOR, LIKE, SIX MONTHS.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.544
OKAY?
SIX MONTHS, AT LEAST.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.945
AND I ALREADY TOLD YOU,

07:57.978 --> 07:58.946
THAT GIRL'S...

07:58.979 --> 08:00.614
- NOT MY DAUGHTER.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.516
- NOW, YOU JUST SAID THAT YOU
HAVE A DAUGHTER NAMED ROSE.

08:02.550 --> 08:03.551
- I DO. SOMEWHERE.

08:03.584 --> 08:07.287
- THAT'S NOT HER?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.255
- IT LOOKS LIKE HER.

08:08.288 --> 08:13.060
AND THIS GIRL'S BEEN
LIVING IN OUR APARTMENT.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.528
BUT SHE'S AN IMPOSTOR.

08:14.562 --> 08:17.631
- AN IMPOSTOR?

08:17.665 --> 08:20.200
- SHE SAYS SHE'S MY ROSE.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.269
TELLS ME STORIES ABOUT
THE THINGS WE USED TO DO

08:22.302 --> 08:23.937
BEFORE I MET JEFF.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.539
SHE EVEN CALLS ME MOMMY.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.807
- [sighs]

08:26.840 --> 08:29.209
- THAT'S BECAUSE
THIS GIRL IS YOUR DAUGHTER.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.078
- STOP CALLING HER THAT.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.615
THIS IS NOT MY ROSE!

08:36.617 --> 08:38.218
- MISS SAMONSKY APPEARS
TO BE SUFFERING

08:38.251 --> 08:40.287
FROM CAPGRAS DELUSION.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.922
- NEVER HEARD OF IT.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.791
- IT'S A RARE MENTAL DISORDER.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.659
PATIENTS SUDDENLY BELIEVE
THAT THEIR LOVED ONES

08:45.693 --> 08:47.695
HAVE BEEN REPLACED
BY DUPLICATES.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.798
REMEMBER THE MOVIE
INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS?

08:50.831 --> 08:52.700
- AMBER THINKS ROSE
IS A POD PERSON?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.635
- EXCEPT THAT THERE WAS NO POD.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.836
JUST AN ACUTE BRAIN INJURY

08:55.869 --> 08:56.970
THAT SEVERED
HER EMOTIONAL RESPONSES

08:57.004 --> 08:58.038
TO HER CHILD.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.307
- MUST HAVE HAPPENED AFTER
SHE GOT HIT BY THE BUS.

09:00.340 --> 09:03.010
- AMBER CAN SEE THAT THE GIRL
LOOKS AND TALKS

09:03.043 --> 09:04.712
EXACTLY LIKE ROSE.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.214
BUT HER ABILITY TO FEEL
ANY LOVE FOR HER IS GONE.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.249
AND THAT DELUSION
COULD EASILY FUEL

09:09.282 --> 09:11.018
HER INDIFFERENCE TO
THE STEPFATHER'S PREDATION

09:11.051 --> 09:12.019
AND NEGLECT.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.320
- SO...

09:13.353 --> 09:14.922
ANY PATHOLOGIES WITH JEFF?

09:14.955 --> 09:17.591
- OTHER THAN EXTREME
INTERNET ADDICTION...

09:17.625 --> 09:19.259
NO, HE'S JUST A JERK.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.293
- WELL, WE NEED MOM
TO FLIP ON JEFF.

09:20.327 --> 09:23.330
- CAPGRAS DELUSION
INVOLVES A VISUAL DISCONNECT

09:23.363 --> 09:24.932
IN BRAIN CIRCUITRY.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.366
WHEN AMBER SEES ROSE,

09:26.399 --> 09:28.602
SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE
IT'S HER REAL DAUGHTER.

09:28.636 --> 09:31.605
- BUT IF SHE
ONLY HEARS ROSE...

09:33.674 --> 09:35.308
- CAN I GO NOW?
CALEB REALLY NEEDS ME.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.176
- NOT JUST YET.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.378
I WANT YOU TO TALK
TO SOMEONE FIRST.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.048
- WHO?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.916
- MOM?

09:42.950 --> 09:46.253
- ROSE?

09:46.286 --> 09:48.321
IS THAT YOU?

09:48.355 --> 09:51.625
- [crying] IT'S ME.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.193
IT'S REALLY ME!

09:53.226 --> 09:54.995
- THAT'S MY DAUGHTER!

09:55.028 --> 09:56.129
LET ME SEE HER!
- NO, NO, NO.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.230
NO, SHH, SHH.
- MOM...

09:57.264 --> 09:58.231
- SHH.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.001
- TELL THEM WHAT
JEFF DID TO ME.

10:01.034 --> 10:04.171
[crying]
HOW HE HURT ME.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.039
- OH, BABY.

10:06.073 --> 10:09.677
I'M SORRY.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.379
WHERE DID YOU GO?

10:12.412 --> 10:14.948
I WENT LOOKING FOR YOU.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.350
- [crying]
HE PUT ME IN THAT ROOM.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.920
NO ONE GAVE ME
ANY FOOD.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.022
- SWEETHEART.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.424
I DIDN'T KNOW.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.660
JEFF SAID YOU WERE FINE.

10:26.694 --> 10:29.963
SOME OTHER GIRL
CAME TO STAY.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.766
- [crying] WHY DID YOU
STOP LOVING ME?

10:32.800 --> 10:36.269
- NO, BABY.

10:36.303 --> 10:40.674
I LOVE YOU
WITH ALL MY HEART.

10:40.708 --> 10:41.675
- I LOVE YOU TOO!

10:41.709 --> 10:43.310
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
- OHH!

10:43.343 --> 10:45.345
- YOU'RE NOT ROSE!

10:45.378 --> 10:46.880
- YES, I AM!

10:46.914 --> 10:48.015
- [gasps]

10:48.048 --> 10:49.883
[smack]
YOU TRICKED ME!

10:49.917 --> 10:51.384
YOU LITTLE BITCH!

10:51.418 --> 10:54.688
SHE'S NOT MY DAUGHTER!
GO AWAY!

10:54.722 --> 10:56.456
YOU'RE NOT MY DAUGHTER!

10:56.489 --> 10:58.125
[sobbing]

11:03.330 --> 11:06.099
- WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO MY MOM?

11:06.133 --> 11:10.971
- ROSE, YOUR MOM
IS VERY SICK.

11:11.004 --> 11:15.175
AND SHE LET YOUR STEPDAD DO...
BAD THINGS TO YOU.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.878
BUT HE WON'T LOCK YOU UP
ANYMORE,

11:17.911 --> 11:19.780
AND HE'LL NEVER, EVER

11:19.813 --> 11:23.083
MAKE YOU BLEED AGAIN
LIKE HE DID.

11:23.116 --> 11:26.854
- THAT WASN'T HIM.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.188
- YOUR STEPDAD...

11:28.221 --> 11:30.323
ISN'T THE ONE WHO
ATTACKED YOU LAST NIGHT?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.092
- NO...

11:32.125 --> 11:36.063
THE OTHER MAN HURT ME.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.197
DOWN THERE.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.402
- AFTER YOU RAN AWAY
FROM THE APARTMENT.

11:42.435 --> 11:47.975
- I WAS HUNGRY, SO I WENT
TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

11:48.008 --> 11:51.945
AND THAT'S WHEN
THE OTHER MAN GRABBED ME.

11:51.979 --> 11:56.116
- DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE?

11:56.149 --> 12:00.888
- HE HAD SOMETHING
OVER HIS FACE.

12:00.921 --> 12:04.024
BUT HIS VOICE WAS MEAN.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.793
- HONEY, WHERE DID HIS HAPPEN?

12:05.826 --> 12:07.294
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHERE IT HAPPENED?

12:07.327 --> 12:11.164
- THE JUNGLE GYM
AT LAFFY TIME.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.199
- LAFFY TIME KIDS CLUB,

12:12.232 --> 12:13.934
A MAGICAL LAND OF FUN, GAMES,

12:13.967 --> 12:15.502
AND SEXUAL ASSAULT.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.137
- I WAS THERE YESTERDAY.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.039
I SHOWED ROSE'S PICTURE
TO THE OWNER.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.273
NICE LADY.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.474
DOZENS OF KIDS
ON THE PLAYGROUND.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.076
- WELL, THERE GOES
OUR CRIME SCENE.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.111
- DID THE NICE LADY
HAPPEN TO MENTION

12:24.144 --> 12:26.179
SHE HAS A PERV
ON THE PAYROLL?

12:26.213 --> 12:28.081
FOUND THIS
ON THE READER'S SECTION.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.017
CAME UP A FEW HOURS AGO.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.119
- "DON'T GO TO LAFFY TIME.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.454
A GUY THERE TOUCHES KIDS."

12:37.124 --> 12:38.992
- EXCUSE ME, MRS. LINDERBEE?

12:39.026 --> 12:41.028
- HELLO AGAIN.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.496
ANY LUCK IDENTIFYING
THAT POOR GIRL WHO WAS ATTACKED?

12:43.530 --> 12:45.165
- WE GOT HER NAME.
NOW WE NEED ANOTHER ONE.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.333
FROM YOU.

12:46.366 --> 12:50.070
- WHAT MEN WORK HERE
AT LAFFY TIME?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.072
- WE HAVE NO MALE EMPLOYEES.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.173
I FIND IT WORKS OUT BEST

12:53.206 --> 12:56.376
TO ONLY HAVE WOMEN
AROUND THE KIDS.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.478
- EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME!

12:58.511 --> 12:59.479
- THEN WHO'S THAT?

12:59.512 --> 13:00.948
A VOLUNTEER PERVERT?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.482
- THAT'S STUART.
HEY! HEY!

13:02.515 --> 13:05.886
HEY. HEY.
- AAH! AAH!

13:05.919 --> 13:06.887
- HEY, HEY, HEY.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.088
DON'T HURT STUART.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.122
HEY, HEY.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.423
HEY.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.425
- [sobbing]

13:12.459 --> 13:13.861
HE'S MY SON.

13:16.063 --> 13:18.065
- ARE YOU GONNA
TAKE ME TO JAIL?

13:18.098 --> 13:20.067
- WELL, STUART, THAT DEPENDS

13:20.100 --> 13:21.501
ON WHERE YOU WERE
TWO NIGHTS AGO.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.470
- TWO NIGHTS AGO...

13:23.503 --> 13:25.005
WAS TUESDAY NIGHT.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.040
I WENT TO CHURCH!

13:27.074 --> 13:29.076
I LIKE CHURCH,
'CAUSE GOD LOVES ME.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.111
- SO OTHER PEOPLE
SAW YOU THERE?

13:31.144 --> 13:32.245
- YEAH, LOTS OF PEOPLE.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.847
UH, MOM WAS THERE TOO.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.082
BUT YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.383
- AND WHY IS THAT, STUART?

13:36.416 --> 13:41.088
- 'CAUSE I'M A REGISTERED
SEX OFFENDER.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.123
- IS THAT TRUE?

13:43.156 --> 13:44.457
- YES, TECHNICALLY,

13:44.491 --> 13:46.960
BUT...

13:46.994 --> 13:47.861
IT'S A MISTAKE.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.497
- SO IS HIM
BEING ANYWHERE NEAR KIDS.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.564
THAT'S A FELONY.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.533
- MA PAYS ME
TO FIX THINGS,

13:53.566 --> 13:56.069
BUT SHE SAYS I GOTTA
STAY OUT OF SIGHT

13:56.103 --> 13:57.537
SO I DON'T GET IN TROUBLE.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.573
- STUART, HUSH.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.309
MY BOY IS DIFFERENT.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.977
IT'S CALLED NOONAN SYNDROME.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.613
- I'M NOT AS SMART
AS OTHER PEOPLE.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.982
- WHEN WAS HE PUT
ON THE OFFENDER REGISTRY?

14:09.016 --> 14:10.483
- TWO SUMMERS AGO.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.954
STUART'S A BAT BOY FOR
A CENTRAL PARK SOFTBALL LEAGUE.

14:13.987 --> 14:17.057
RESTROOM WAS OUT OF ORDER,
SO HE PEED IN THE BUSHES.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.625
- SOME PEOPLE SAW MY WEE-WEE.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.961
- A MAN SAID STUART
FLASHED HIS KIDS.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.595
THE JUDGE TOOK
ONE LOOK AT HIM...

14:22.629 --> 14:24.597
- AND SUDDENLY YOUR SON'S
A CHILD MOLESTER.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.066
- HE WAS RAILROADED.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.267
HE'S BEEN THIS WAY
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

14:27.300 --> 14:32.072
GETTING POINTED AT,
CALLED NAMES.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.941
KIDS ADORE STUART.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.343
IT'S THE ADULTS
THAT GET FREAKED OUT.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.345
- ONE OF THOSE ADULTS WROTE
A PRETTY NASTY COMMENT

14:38.378 --> 14:39.379
ON YOUR WEBSITE.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.381
- I TRIED TO DELETE THEM.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.219
IT HAS TO BE THE SAME PEOPLE

14:46.253 --> 14:48.421
WHO STAPLED THESE
UP AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.691
- "I TOUCH KIDS
AT LAFFY TIME."

14:51.724 --> 14:53.693
- IT'S FROM SOMETHING
CALLED COAP.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.028
- IT'S PRONOUNCED "COPE."

14:55.062 --> 14:56.964
CITIZENS ORGANIZED
AGAINST PREDATORS.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.933
- WE KNOW ONE OF THESE
CONCERNED CITIZENS.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.570
- KICK!

15:03.603 --> 15:05.105
BLOCK!

15:05.138 --> 15:06.673
PUNCH!

15:06.706 --> 15:08.441
KICK!

15:08.475 --> 15:10.210
BLOCK!

15:10.243 --> 15:12.579
PUNCH!
- ERIK.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.580
HELLO.
- HI.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.215
OH, DANIELLE.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.649
OKAY, KIDS.
KEEP GOING.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.952
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, KICK!

15:18.986 --> 15:20.487
- HEY, OLIVIA.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.656
WHAT A PLEASURE.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.591
- I SEE YOU'RE
FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.527
- OH, COAP ASKED ME
IF I'D GIVE LESSONS.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.461
KEEP THE KIDS SAFE.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.964
- YEAH, WAS THAT
THE THINKING BEHIND THIS?

15:30.998 --> 15:33.466
- ARE YOU SAYING
WE DID SOMETHING WRONG?

15:33.500 --> 15:35.602
YOU KNOW, I THE COMMUNITY
HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW

15:35.635 --> 15:37.704
WHEN--IF THERE'S A SEX OFFENDER
IN THEIR MIDST.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.206
- PUTTING UP WANTED SIGNS
MAY HAVE NOT BEEN

15:39.239 --> 15:40.974
THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT IT.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.009
- HEY, IT'S PUBLIC
INFORMATION.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.610
EASILY FOUND ON THE WEB,
YOU KNOW?

15:43.643 --> 15:45.545
JUST--JUST LIKE
THIS APP, YOU KNOW?

15:45.578 --> 15:48.348
WHICH YOU CAN USE TO IDENTIFY
CREEPS ALL AROUND US.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.017
- "PERV POINTER."

15:50.050 --> 15:52.452
- ONE OF THE COAP'S FOUNDERS
DESIGNED IT.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.287
IT'S FROM
THE OFFICIAL DATABASE.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.423
THAT'S HOW WE FOUND
THE INFORMATION ON STUART.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.091
- WITHOUT KNOWING
HIS REAL STORY.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.526
- ARE YOU DEFENDING THIS GUY?

15:59.559 --> 16:00.660
- NAH, I'M NOT
DEFENDING ANYONE.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.996
BUT ALL OFFENDERS
AREN'T ALIKE.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.731
THERE ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS
ON THE REGISTRY.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.566
- SOME MAY BE ON THERE
BY MISTAKE.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.568
- YEAH, WELL, MOST AREN'T.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.670
YOU REALLY THINK THE POLICE
CAN KEEP AN EYE ON ALL OF THEM?

16:10.703 --> 16:12.705
- YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE
THE PERSON TO PICK UP THE SLACK?

16:12.739 --> 16:14.674
- OKAY, SO THE FLYER WAS
A LITTLE BIT OVER THE TOP.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.642
BUT I LIVE HERE.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.345
I CAN KEEP TABS ON THEM
BETTER THAN YOU CAN.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.214
YOU KNOW,
AS A MATTER OF FACT...

16:21.248 --> 16:23.750
I CAN DIG DEEPER
THAN THE POLICE ARE ALLOWED TO.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.452
- WELL, LET'S NOT TURN COAP
INTO A LYNCH MOB.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.187
- WANNA HELP US, LEGALLY?

16:27.220 --> 16:29.456
SHOW THIS AROUND
AFTER CLASS.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.359
- OH, MY GOD, THE--
THAT GIRL WAS ATTACKED?

16:32.392 --> 16:34.127
- JUST ASK ANYONE
IF THEY SAW HER ON THE STREET

16:34.161 --> 16:35.428
TUESDAY NIGHT WITH A MAN.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.031
- AND IF THEY DID,
DON'T LIFT A FINGER,

16:38.065 --> 16:39.366
EXCEPT TO CALL US.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.368
- HEY, I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR CELL NUMBER AS WELL.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.136
- YEAH,
PRECINCT NUMBER'LL DO.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.804
- HEY, I'M STILL AVAILABLE
FOR THAT COFFEE.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.607
- GOSH, I THOUGHT
HE'D NEVER ASK.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.709
- THE GIRL WAS ATTACKED HERE
TWO DAYS AGO.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.078
WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.080
- HOLD ON.
I GOT DRIPS OF SOMETHING HERE.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.814
- IT LOOKS WHITE AND STICKY.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.550
- HEY, YOU!
BRING YOUR KIT.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.587
- HEY, YOU GUYS
NEED SOME HELP?

17:00.620 --> 17:01.654
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, KID?

17:01.688 --> 17:02.789
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

17:02.822 --> 17:05.158
- I'M HERE WATCHING YOU.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.826
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.195
- IT'S A CRIME SCENE.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.729
YOU NEED TO BE
BEHIND THAT YELLOW TAPE.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.332
- WAIT, I DON'T--
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.833
[vomits]

17:13.866 --> 17:15.168
- OHH.
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.736
LET ME GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.106
- ALL RIGHT.
THANKS ANYWAY, FIN.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.573
- FIND ANYTHING
AT THE PLAYGROUND?

17:20.607 --> 17:22.409
- ONLY ENOUGH SPIT,
SNOT, AND BARF

17:22.442 --> 17:24.277
TO KEEP CSU
RUNNING DNA FOR A YEAR.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.745
- SO NO CRIME SCENE
AND NOTHING OFF OUR CANVAS.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.380
BOY, WE'RE SCREWED.
- DETECTIVES!

17:27.414 --> 17:28.815
TESS CHANG, CHANNEL THREE.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.817
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
A RAPIST STALKING YOUNG GIRLS--

17:30.850 --> 17:32.852
- WE DON'T COMMENT
ON AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.421
- SO YOU'RE DENYING
THIS NINE-YEAR-OLD

17:34.454 --> 17:35.822
WAS RAPED TWO NIGHTS AGO?

17:35.855 --> 17:36.856
- WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
- I NEVER REVEAL MY SOURCES.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.125
- I KNOW WHERE.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.426
- YOU CAN'T SHOW
A VICTIM'S FACE.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.827
- DETECTIVE,
LET ME REMIND YOU,

17:40.860 --> 17:41.828
WE'RE LIVE
ON THE AIR RIGHT NOW.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.430
- GOOD, THEN I JUST KEPT YOU

17:43.463 --> 17:44.731
FROM VIOLATING
A VICTIM'S PRIVACY.

17:44.764 --> 17:48.835
- AND YOU JUST VIOLATED
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS!

17:48.868 --> 17:49.736
- I'M GONNA KILL ERIK.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.204
- TOLD THE GUY TO KEEP IT
ON THE D.L.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.505
HE GOES RIGHT TO THE LEECHES.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.174
- THAT'S QUITE A PERFORMANCE,
YOU TWO.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.608
- WAIT A MINUTE, CAPTAIN.
WE WERE PROVOKED.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.776
- JUST TURN AROUND
AND GET YOUR ASSES

17:56.809 --> 17:58.545
BACK DOWN THAT ELEVATOR.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.180
- I'M NOT APOLOGIZING
TO ANYONE.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.115
- I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.083
ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL WAS RAPED.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.859
- PLEASE, MY DAUGHTER NEEDS ME.

18:12.892 --> 18:13.860
- JUST, LOOK, GIVE MY PARTNER
A MINUTE WITH HER.

18:13.893 --> 18:14.827
- TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

18:14.861 --> 18:18.698
- UH, MADDY HAS SWIM CLASS.
DOWN AT THE Y.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.767
THEN SHE WALKS TO THE CORNER
WHERE I PICK HER UP.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.869
WHY DIDN'T I
GET HERE ON TIME?

18:22.902 --> 18:24.637
- AND WHEN YOU ARRIVED,
DID YOU SEE ANY MEN IN THE AREA?

18:24.671 --> 18:26.473
- NO, SHE WAS JUST
SITTING ON THE CURB,

18:26.506 --> 18:28.275
BLEEDING AND CRYING.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.577
OH, GOD, MANDY.

18:30.610 --> 18:35.415
- YOU SURE THAT YOU
NEVER SAW HIS FACE?

18:35.448 --> 18:37.884
MANDY, HE CAN'T HURT YOU.

18:37.917 --> 18:43.290
NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID,
HE CANNOT HURT YOU.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.926
- HE...HAD A MASK.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.897
AND IT WAS DARK IN THERE.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.333
EXCEPT WHEN HE
TOOK MY PICTURE.

18:53.366 --> 18:56.269
- AND HE PULLED YOU
RIGHT BEHIND THIS FENCE?

18:56.303 --> 18:58.171
- I TRIED TO MAKE HIM STOP.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.906
- OF COURSE YOU DID,
'CAUSE YOU'RE A VERY BRAVE GIRL.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.341
- MANDY!

19:01.374 --> 19:03.876
OH, BABY, I'M RIGHT HERE.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.613
- UH, MANDY, I STILL HAVE
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.515
AND THEN YOU NEED
TO GO SEE A DOCTOR,

19:08.548 --> 19:11.184
AND YOUR MOM
CAN RIDE WITH YOU, OKAY?

19:11.218 --> 19:14.221
SO TELL ME ABOUT THE MASK.
WHAT COLOR WAS THE MASK?

19:14.254 --> 19:16.856
- WE'RE CALLED CITIZENS
ORGANIZED AGAINST PREDATORS.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.392
- THIS IS, UH, CHECK US OUT.
CHECK OUR WEBSITE.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.394
YOU GO--HEY.

19:21.428 --> 19:22.962
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
- YOU.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.598
GIVING OUT ROSE'S PICTURE
TO CHANNEL 3 NEWS.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.300
- NO, I ONLY GAVE IT
TO OTHER COAP MEMBERS.

19:27.334 --> 19:31.771
- WELL, THEN ONE OF THEM
GAVE IT TO A REPORTER.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.773
NOW, YOU REALLY ARE
AN AMATEUR.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.875
- OH, AND YOU PROS
ARE DOING SO MUCH BETTER.

19:35.908 --> 19:36.909
- WEBER, BACK OFF.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.845
- TO WHERE, HUH?

19:38.878 --> 19:40.547
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
IS OUR HOME.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.681
I MEAN, YOU, YOUR KIDS,

19:41.714 --> 19:42.915
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WALK THESE STREETS.

19:42.949 --> 19:43.950
- THEY'RE BEING EYEBALLED
BY PEDOPHILES

19:43.983 --> 19:45.285
EVERYWHERE THEY TURN.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.586
- WHAT ARE THE COPS
DOING ABOUT THIS?

19:46.619 --> 19:49.822
- FOLKS, THE NYPD IS WORKING
AS FAST AS WE CAN

19:49.856 --> 19:51.291
TO FIND THIS GUY.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.792
- OH, REALLY?
SO WHO'S YOUR SUSPECT, HUH?

19:52.825 --> 19:55.528
THE SERIAL FONDLER
TWO STREETS OVER?

19:55.562 --> 19:56.896
- HOW 'BOUT THE GROPER
LIVING BY THE PLAYGROUND?

19:56.929 --> 19:59.666
- OR WHAT ABOUT THE BABY RAPIST
DOWN THE BLOCK?

19:59.699 --> 20:02.902
APARTMENT 335.
YOU GOING AFTER HIM?

20:02.935 --> 20:04.937
- DON'T SHOVE THINGS
IN MY FACE.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.373
- HEY!

20:06.406 --> 20:08.575
- MANDY'S MOM
HAS A QUESTION FOR YOU.

20:09.776 --> 20:10.843
ERIK...

20:10.877 --> 20:12.779
LISTEN TO ME.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.713
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU WORK WITH THAT GUY.

20:13.746 --> 20:14.514
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T NEED TO.

20:14.547 --> 20:18.318
YOU'VE GOT TO LET US
DO OUR JOBS.

20:18.351 --> 20:21.288
- YEAH, I'M SORRY,
YOU KNOW, IT...

20:21.321 --> 20:22.855
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL
WITH THAT GIRL'S PHOTO.

20:22.889 --> 20:26.459
IT'S JUST--EVERY TIME I HEAR
ABOUT A CHILD BEING ATTACKED,

20:26.493 --> 20:30.563
I JUST GET--
- YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.764
- GRACE, YEAH.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.267
- I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS
IS PERSONAL FOR YOU.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.569
IT'S PERSONAL TO US TOO.

20:36.603 --> 20:39.739
BUT SOMETIMES
A PERSONAL CONNECTION,

20:39.772 --> 20:41.874
IT GETS IN THE WAY,
IT BLURS YOUR JUDGMENT.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.476
- NO.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.645
NO, I'M SEEING CLEARLY.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.013
YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAID.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.550
YOU KNOW, I'VE FOUND DIRT
ON THE PERVS AROUND HERE.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.520
I--I GOT STUFF
YOU GUYS DON'T EVEN KNOW.

20:53.553 --> 20:54.954
- ERIK, THAT'S ENOUGH.
ALL RIGHT?

20:54.987 --> 20:57.324
EVEN IF YOU DON'T TRUST
DETECTIVE STABLER,

20:57.357 --> 20:58.625
TRUST ME.

20:58.658 --> 20:59.959
WE'RE GONNA GET THIS GUY.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.961
THE RIGHT WAY.

21:04.864 --> 21:05.965
- THESE ARE OUR OFFENDERS

21:05.998 --> 21:08.435
IN THE TEN BLOCKS SURROUNDING
THE TWO CRIME SCENES.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.502
- WELL, YOU BETTER
GET OUT THERE

21:09.536 --> 21:10.803
AND START CORRALLING
THESE CREEPS.

21:10.837 --> 21:11.871
- CAPTAIN, THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS1

21:11.904 --> 21:13.573
WE ALL WANT
TO SEE OUR CLIENTS!

21:13.606 --> 21:14.841
- YOU WILL, COUNSELOR.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.476
IT'S A LITTLE BUSY
IN HERE AT THE MOMENT.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.577
- CAN ANYONE VERIFY THAT YOU
WERE OUT OF TOWN

21:17.610 --> 21:18.578
TILL THIS MORNING?

21:18.611 --> 21:19.912
- YEAH, MY IN-LAWS.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.581
IN FLORIDA.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.782
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE LAFFY TIME IS.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.617
- 30 FEET FROM
YOUR STOOP, GENIUS.

21:24.651 --> 21:25.618
- WHY THE HELL'D
YOU DRAG ME IN HERE?

21:25.652 --> 21:27.920
- TO TALK ABOUT THE TWO
LITTLE GIRLS YOU RAPED.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.922
- RAPED?
YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.524
- I DIDN'T ATTACK ANYONE!

21:31.558 --> 21:32.725
- YOU MEAN TODAY,

21:32.759 --> 21:35.094
'CAUSE YOUR SHEET SHOWS YOU
MOLESTING YOUR COUSIN IN '06

21:35.127 --> 21:36.829
AND FEELING A NEIGHBOR GIRL
IN '08.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.031
- LOOK, MAN, THAT WAS
JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING!

21:39.065 --> 21:40.700
- CLEAR. CLEAR.

21:40.733 --> 21:41.768
CLEAR. THAT'S IT.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.336
LAST ALIBI CHECKS OUT.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.838
- NOW WE JUST GOTTA HAVE
THIS JOINT FUMIGATED.

21:45.872 --> 21:46.906
- WELL, WE'LL SETTLE
FOR A FALSE CONFESSION

21:46.939 --> 21:48.408
JUST TO MIX THINGS UP.

21:48.441 --> 21:49.676
- WELL, SOMETIMES
YOU SHAKE THE TREE

21:49.709 --> 21:51.844
AND NOTHING FALLS OUT.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.746
- WELL, LET'S FIND MORE TREES
TO SHAKE IN THE MORNING.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.415
GO HOME.
ALL OF YOU.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.956
- YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.191
- I HOPE NOT.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.494
- LOOK, HE SAID THAT HE HAD
SOME KIND OF SECRET INFORMATION.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.861
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SCARED OF.

22:08.895 --> 22:09.929
ERIK GIVES US
SOMETHING GOOD,

22:09.962 --> 22:11.030
AND THEN ANY CASE
WE BUILD ON,

22:11.063 --> 22:12.399
IT GETS THROWN OUT
IN COURT.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.332
- OR IT COULD BE JUST ENOUGH

22:13.366 --> 22:16.035
TO STOP ANOTHER GIRL
FROM GETTING RAPED.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.937
- AND IF SOMEBODY SEES ME
COMPARING NOTES

22:17.970 --> 22:19.038
WITH A KNOWN VIGILANTE?

22:19.071 --> 22:20.139
- RELAX,
YOU'RE HAVING COFFEE

22:20.172 --> 22:21.741
WITH A GUY
WHO THINKS YOU'RE CUTE.

22:26.613 --> 22:29.849
- I HOPE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THIS, OLIVIA.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.384
I'M ALL OUT OF COFFEE.

22:31.418 --> 22:34.086
- AFTER THE DAY, I'VE HAD,
WINE IS EVEN BETTER.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.056
- WELL, I'M GLAD WE FINALLY
GOT TO, UH...

22:37.089 --> 22:42.629
- ERIK, THIS IS
PURELY PROFESSIONAL.

22:42.662 --> 22:43.963
SO YOU'RE A GRAPHIC ARTIST.

22:43.996 --> 22:47.467
- YEP. UH, CORPORATE SITES,
ONLINE DESIGN.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.502
HEH, YOU KNOW,
IT'S PRETTY BORING

22:49.536 --> 22:50.870
COMPARED TO BEING
A COP, BUT, UH...

22:50.903 --> 22:51.771
- [laughs]

22:51.804 --> 22:53.773
- THAT'S HOW I GOT INVOLVED
WITH COAP.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.475
THEY WANTED TO HIRE ME
TO DO THEIR WEBSITES,

22:55.508 --> 22:57.677
AND I--I SAID
I'D DO IT FOR FREE.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.812
- WELL, THEY'RE LUCKY
THEY FOUND YOU.

22:59.846 --> 23:00.880
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD.

23:00.913 --> 23:03.583
- THANKS.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.552
- OH, THAT'S HER,
ISN'T IT?

23:05.585 --> 23:06.953
YOUR SISTER.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.789
- YEAH, I PAINTED THIS
WHEN I WAS 16.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.924
RIGHT AFTER THE ATTACK.

23:11.958 --> 23:14.794
- IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.963
- I WANTED TO SHOW GRACE

23:16.996 --> 23:19.131
HOW HAPPY SHE WAS.

23:19.165 --> 23:22.602
HOW SHE COULD
GET BACK THERE.

23:22.635 --> 23:26.072
BUT THE RAPIST
TOOK EVERYTHING.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.908
THREE MONTHS LATER, MY...

23:28.941 --> 23:32.512
MY MOTHER FOUND HER
HANGING IN THE CLOSET.

23:32.545 --> 23:33.913
- I'M SO SORRY.

23:36.649 --> 23:40.487
- YEAH, I WENT TO A PRETTY DARK
PLACE MYSELF.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.055
YOU KNOW, I WAS
HER BIG BROTHER, I...

23:43.089 --> 23:44.491
I SHOULD HAVE PROTECTED HER.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.125
- YOU WERE A KID YOURSELF.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.795
- NOT AFTER SHE DIED.

23:48.828 --> 23:51.731
I...

23:51.764 --> 23:53.866
I REALIZED I COULD
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

23:53.900 --> 23:58.037
UM, IT'S TOO LATE
FOR GRACE, BUT...

23:58.070 --> 24:00.973
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.776
- ERIK, WE HAVE TO BE
REALLY CAREFUL.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.178
- [chuckles] DIDN'T YOU
COME HERE FOR MY HELP?

24:06.212 --> 24:08.615
- I DID,
BUT YOU'RE A CIVILIAN.

24:08.648 --> 24:11.083
AND BY LAW, I CAN'T
DIRECT YOU TO DO ANYTHING,

24:11.117 --> 24:12.952
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S ILLEGAL.

24:12.985 --> 24:13.786
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

24:13.820 --> 24:17.590
I DID THIS ON MY OWN,
MONTHS AGO.

24:17.624 --> 24:18.891
- DID WHAT?

24:22.228 --> 24:24.163
- OKAY.

24:24.196 --> 24:27.066
CHILD MOLESTERS
ARE ALL ABOUT SECRECY.

24:27.099 --> 24:28.835
RIGHT? THEY MUST
ALWAYS BE WORRIED

24:28.868 --> 24:30.870
ABOUT COMPUTER SECURITY.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.705
WHICH CHAT ROOMS THEY VISIT

24:32.739 --> 24:34.941
OR HOW THEY TRADE
THEIR KIDDY PORN.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.544
SO...

24:37.577 --> 24:38.978
I CAME UP WITH...

24:39.011 --> 24:40.847
A BUNCH OF THESE.

24:40.880 --> 24:44.083
- "NEED 100% SECURITY?
I'VE GOT THE ANSWER.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.718
DRIVE ANNIHILATOR."

24:45.752 --> 24:47.053
- YEAH, I WENT ALL AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD

24:47.086 --> 24:49.188
AND I PUT THESE
ON THE DOORKNOBS

24:49.221 --> 24:51.791
OF EVERYONE LISTED
ON PERV POINTER.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.159
- AND FISH STARTED BITIN'?

24:53.192 --> 24:54.661
- LIKE CRAZY.

24:54.694 --> 24:55.628
I MEAN, I MUST HAVE DOWNLOADED
DRIVE ANNIHILATOR

24:55.662 --> 24:59.131
ON 50, 60 COMPUTERS
IN THE FIVE BOROUGHS,

24:59.165 --> 25:01.834
AND I DID IT
ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.603
AND I--I NEVER WENT
INTO ANYONE'S APARTMENT.

25:03.636 --> 25:07.106
- ONLY YOUR SECURITY SYSTEM
WASN'T 100% SECURE.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.274
- IT INSTALLED A TROJAN VIRUS

25:08.307 --> 25:09.809
WHICH ATTACKS
THE HARD DRIVE,

25:09.842 --> 25:12.178
ALLOWING--ALLOWING ME
TO REMOTELY VIEW

25:12.211 --> 25:13.613
EVERYTHING THEY DOWNLOAD,

25:13.646 --> 25:14.847
EVERYTHING THEY TRADE,

25:14.881 --> 25:15.848
EVERYTHING PERIOD.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.917
- AND I CAN'T SEE ANY OF IT

25:17.950 --> 25:20.920
BECAUSE IT WAS
COLLECTED ILLEGALLY.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.756
- DID YOU KNOW THAT,
IN 2007,

25:23.790 --> 25:25.892
COPS IN CALIFORNIA
USED EVIDENCE

25:25.925 --> 25:27.727
OBTAINED BY A HACKER

25:27.760 --> 25:30.096
TO CONVICT A SITTING
SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE

25:30.129 --> 25:34.767
OF POSSESSION OF THOUSANDS
OF KIDDY PORN IMAGES

25:34.801 --> 25:37.169
LIKE I FOUND...

25:37.203 --> 25:42.008
HERE, ON ALL THESE
PERVERTS' HARD DRIVES.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.011
- OH, MY GOD, ERIK.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.681
- AND EACH ONE HAS
HUNDREDS OF IMAGES.

25:48.715 --> 25:49.949
- YOU'RE GENIUS.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.851
- HIT THE MOTHER LODE, HUH?

25:51.884 --> 25:53.886
- CAN YOU SORT BY GENDER?

25:53.920 --> 25:55.087
- AND BY DATE.

25:55.121 --> 25:59.025
UH, FEMALE IMAGES ONLY,
PAST 48 HOURS.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.727
[beep]

26:00.760 --> 26:04.063
[clicking]

26:04.096 --> 26:05.932
- SO MANY INNOCENT VICTIMS.

26:05.965 --> 26:09.268
- HOPEFULLY NOT FOR LONG.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.970
- HOLD ON.
GO BACK. GO BACK.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.941
STOP.

26:14.974 --> 26:17.810
THAT'S THE FIRST GIRL,
ROSE SAMONSKY.

26:17.844 --> 26:19.679
[keys clicking]

26:19.712 --> 26:21.247
- THAT'S, UM...

26:21.280 --> 26:24.216
THAT'S COMING FROM A COMPUTER
IN THE UPPER EAST SIDE.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.718
- THE TIME STAMP SAYS

26:25.752 --> 26:28.187
IT WAS UPLOADED 90 MINUTES
AFTER THE ATTACK.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.857
- ISN'T THAT THE GIRL
FROM YESTERDAY?

26:30.890 --> 26:31.858
[beep]

26:31.891 --> 26:34.226
- MANDY LECOMPTE.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.962
WE JUST FOUND OUR RAPIST.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.132
- MEETINGS ALL DAY.
I'LL BE HOME LATE, HMM?

26:40.166 --> 26:41.300
- MWAH. BYE, HON.

26:41.333 --> 26:42.669
- BYE-BYE.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.704
WE LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU!

26:44.737 --> 26:47.907
- EDWIN ADELSON...
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.275
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.376
- WE'RE GONNA TAKE
YOUR COMPUTERS, MA'AM.

26:50.409 --> 26:51.510
DON'T GET IN THE WAY.

26:51.543 --> 26:53.245
- ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU...

26:53.279 --> 26:54.847
- EDWIN!
- ...THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.883
- LOUISE!
- EDWIN!

26:56.916 --> 26:58.184
- LOUISE!

26:58.217 --> 26:59.385
WHY AM I HERE?
- WELL, LET'S SEE.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.888
WHY WERE YOU IN
A CONNECTICUT POLICE STATION

27:01.921 --> 27:03.222
IN 1997?

27:03.255 --> 27:04.390
AH, THAT'S RIGHT.

27:04.423 --> 27:07.894
INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL CONTACT
WITH A TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.228
- KIND OF LIKE WHY YOU WERE
IN A MARYLAND POLICE STATION

27:09.261 --> 27:10.897
IN 2002.

27:10.930 --> 27:14.000
HMM? FORCIBLE FONDLING
OF A NINE-YEAR-OLD.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.002
- I ADMITTED TO THOSE.

27:16.035 --> 27:19.371
I WENT AWAY.
- NOT LONG ENOUGH.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.908
WHERE WERE YOU
YESTERDAY AT 4:30?

27:21.941 --> 27:23.109
- I ALWAYS TAKE
AN AFTERNOON BREAK.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.944
READ AT A PARK
NEAR MY OFFICE.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.313
- KIPS BAY?
- YEAH.

27:27.346 --> 27:28.848
- ROSE AND MANDY
WERE RAPED THERE.

27:28.881 --> 27:29.849
- WHO?

27:29.882 --> 27:32.318
- EDWIN...

27:32.351 --> 27:34.220
ANYBODY SEE YOU IN THE PARK?

27:34.253 --> 27:35.221
- SOMEBODY MUST HAVE.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.989
- YEAH, AND WHAT
WERE YOU READING, LOLITA?

27:37.023 --> 27:38.958
GET YOUR JUICES FLOWING
BEFORE YOU ATTACKED MANDY?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.459
- I DON'T KNOW
WHO THOSE GIRLS ARE.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.761
- DIDN'T ASK 'EM
THEIR NAMES, HUH?

27:41.794 --> 27:43.295
YOU JUST TOLD 'EM
TO SAY CHEESE.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.032
- THESE YOURS?

27:46.065 --> 27:47.800
- I DIDN'T TAKE THAT.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.368
- WELL, EXPLAIN TO US

27:49.401 --> 27:51.270
HOW WE FOUND THOSE
ON YOUR HOME COMPUTER.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.872
- YOU WHAT?

27:52.905 --> 27:54.974
- YEAH, AND ALL THE WHILE
YOU'RE BEING A PERV...

27:55.007 --> 27:57.009
YOUR PRETTY, PREGNANT WIFE
IS OUT THERE

27:57.043 --> 27:58.444
SHOPPING FOR BABY CLOTHES.

27:58.477 --> 27:59.979
- I DON'T EVEN WANT TO ASK
IF SHE'S EXPECTING A GIRL.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.147
- PLEASE, PLEASE,
I DIDN'T DO THIS,

28:01.180 --> 28:02.815
AND YOU HAVE
TO LET ME GO.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.784
LOUISE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT MY PAST.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.085
- HOW'S THAT? YOU'RE
IN THE OFFENDER REGISTRY.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.386
YOU HAVE TO SEE
YOUR PAROLE OFFICER.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.055
- I KEPT IT ALL SECRET.

28:09.088 --> 28:11.023
- SEE--SEE,
WE JUST MET A YEAR AGO.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.825
KIND OF A WHIRLWIND THING.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.794
- YEAH. WELL, GUESS
WHO CRASHED BACK TO EARTH.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.429
- EDWIN--CONNECTICUT,
MARYLAND, NOW NEW YORK.

28:17.463 --> 28:18.898
THREE STRIKES, YOU'RE OUT.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.900
- [whispering] OH, GOD.

28:24.403 --> 28:28.841
I WANT TO SEE MY LAWYER
RIGHT NOW.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.276
- DON'T YOU JUST HATE TO SEE
A GROWN MAN CRY?

28:30.309 --> 28:32.011
- HIGHLIGHT OF MY DAY.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.913
- DETECTIVES BENSON
OR STABLER?

28:33.946 --> 28:35.281
- YOU GOT THE BOTH OF US.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.184
- BRENDA FAIRCHILD,
ADELSON FAMILY COUNSEL.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.819
I'D LIKE TO SEE EDWIN.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.353
- TOO LATE.
DUE AT AN ARRAIGNMENT.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.855
- ON WHAT CHARGE?

28:42.889 --> 28:45.057
- RAPE OF A MINOR.
TWO OF 'EM.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.893
- [scoffs]

28:46.926 --> 28:47.860
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

28:47.894 --> 28:50.229
EDWIN ADELSON IS A RESPECTED
TAX CONSULTANT,

28:50.262 --> 28:52.531
CHURCH DEACON--
A PILLAR OF HIS COMMUNITY.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.234
- YOU'RE FORGETTING
REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.036
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

28:57.069 --> 28:57.970
WELL, I GOTTA
HAND IT TO EDWIN.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.338
HE SURE KNOWS HOW
TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

28:59.371 --> 29:00.406
- NO! UHH!

29:00.439 --> 29:02.374
- ADMIT WHAT YOU DID,
YOU FREAK!

29:02.408 --> 29:04.510
- UHH! NO!

29:04.543 --> 29:07.046
GET THIS GUY OFF OF ME!
AAH!

29:07.079 --> 29:08.014
- OFFICER, LET HIM GO!

29:08.047 --> 29:10.316
- GET OFF ME!

29:10.349 --> 29:12.484
GET OFF ME!
HE RAPED THOSE GIRLS!

29:12.518 --> 29:14.553
HE RAPED
THOSE GIRLS!

29:14.586 --> 29:16.422
GET OFF ME!

29:16.455 --> 29:18.324
- [wheezing]
HELP ME. HELP ME.

29:18.357 --> 29:19.391
HELP ME.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.502
- THIS CLOWN
REALLY ON THE JOB?

29:30.536 --> 29:31.437
- AL MCCUTCHEON
FROM THE ONE-EIGHT.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.472
- HE LIED HIS WAY PAST
THE DESK SERGEANT.

29:33.505 --> 29:35.241
SAID HE WAS HERE
FOR A PRISON TRANSFER.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.276
- YOU MAKE IT A HABIT TO BEAT UP
GUYS IN CUSTODY,

29:37.309 --> 29:39.145
OFFICER MCCUTCHEON?

29:39.178 --> 29:41.147
- LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT...

29:41.180 --> 29:42.081
MY DAUGHTER'S
IN THE SAME SWIM CLASS

29:42.114 --> 29:44.817
AS THE GIRL WHO GOT RAPED
TWO NIGHTS AGO.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.585
MY CARLA'S HAD HER OVER
FOR SLEEPOVERS.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.088
WHEN I HEARD YOU GUYS FINALLY
CAUGHT THE SON OF A BITCH...

29:49.121 --> 29:52.091
- YOU DECIDED TO TUNE HIM UP.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.592
- I DIDN'T DECIDE ANYTHING.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.128
I JUST...SAW RED.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.864
- YEAH, WELL,
THE ASS YOU JUST KICKED

29:57.897 --> 30:00.266
IS YOUR OWN CAREER.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.135
- I KNOW.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.437
SHOULD HAVE NEVER SIGNED UP
FOR THOSE TWEETS.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.406
- TWEETS? FROM WHO?

30:07.439 --> 30:09.108
- A WATCH GROUP
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

30:09.141 --> 30:12.111
THEY SEND OUT INFO
ABOUT SEXUAL PREDATORS.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.113
CALL 'EM CREEP TWEETS.

30:17.249 --> 30:20.552
- CREEP TWEETS ARE AN INTERNET
COMMUNICATION, YOUR HONOR.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.255
ONE THAT TRIGGERED
A DESPICABLE ACT

30:23.289 --> 30:25.391
OF VIGILANTE VIOLENCE
AGAINST MY CLIENT.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.393
AND BY A POLICE OFFICER,
NO LESS.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.228
- THE MAN PRACTICALLY
BROKE MY JAW.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.964
- ASSAULTED IN CUSTODY,
MS. WEST?

30:31.998 --> 30:35.067
DOESN'T EXACTLY INSPIRE
CONFIDENCE

30:35.101 --> 30:37.003
IN YOUR REQUEST FOR REMAND.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.071
- AN UNEXPECTED AND REGRETTABLE
INCIDENT, YOUR HONOR.

30:39.105 --> 30:40.406
BUT CAPTAIN CRAGEN HERE
HAS ASSURED ME

30:40.439 --> 30:41.507
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

30:41.540 --> 30:45.044
- CAPTAIN CRAGEN, COULD YOU
STEP FORWARD, PLEASE?

30:45.077 --> 30:48.414
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS
TO ASK YOU.

30:48.447 --> 30:51.117
CAPTAIN, HOW MANY
POLICE PERSONNEL

30:51.150 --> 30:53.352
DO YOU HAVE
IN YOUR PRECINCT?

30:53.385 --> 30:56.188
- UH, APPROXIMATELY 100,
YOUR HONOR.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.224
- AND YET, SOMEHOW,

30:58.257 --> 31:01.293
ONE SOLITARY MAN
GOT PAST ALL OF YOU?

31:01.327 --> 31:04.330
- OFFICER MCCUTCHEON ENTERED
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES,

31:04.363 --> 31:06.132
WITH FAKED PAPERWORK--

31:06.165 --> 31:10.202
- A SIMPLE YES OR NO
WILL SUFFICE.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.470
- YES.

31:11.503 --> 31:12.939
- YOUR HONOR, CAPTAIN CRAGEN

31:12.972 --> 31:14.941
IS NOT THE PERSON
BEING ARRAIGNED HERE TODAY.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.108
- YOUR HONOR,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

31:16.142 --> 31:18.110
PLEASE DO NOT
RELEASE THIS MAN ON BAIL.

31:18.144 --> 31:19.311
HE IS A SERIOUS
FLIGHT RISK.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.180
- WITH A BABY DUE IN A MONTH?

31:21.213 --> 31:22.648
I WOULD SAY THAT CONSTITUTES

31:22.681 --> 31:24.917
A VERY SIGNIFICANT TIE

31:24.951 --> 31:26.085
TO THE COMMUNITY.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.653
- THE COMMUNITY
NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED

31:27.686 --> 31:29.221
FROM EDWIN ADELSON.

31:29.255 --> 31:32.158
- NO! I NEED TO BE
PROTECTED FROM THE POLICE.

31:32.191 --> 31:35.294
- AND I CAN ONLY AGREE,
MR. ADELSON,

31:35.327 --> 31:39.999
BECAUSE OF THE LAPSES THAT
OCCURRED ON YOUR WATCH, CAPTAIN.

31:40.032 --> 31:43.035
BAIL IS GRANTED AT $50,000.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.604
MR. ADELSON WILL
SURRENDER HIS PASSPORT.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.306
[bangs gavel]

31:47.339 --> 31:48.574
- JUST A BIT OF PAPERWORK,

31:48.607 --> 31:50.176
AND YOUR WIFE WILL BE
PICKING YOU UP

31:50.209 --> 31:51.210
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.411
- OH, GOD, NO.

31:52.444 --> 31:53.946
LOUISE CAN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS,

31:53.980 --> 31:55.714
OR ANYBODY ELSE.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.950
- COAP IS HERE SO THAT
EDWIN ADELSON KNOWS

31:57.984 --> 32:00.152
WE ARE WATCHING
HIS EVERY MOVE.

32:00.186 --> 32:02.654
WE CARE ABOUT
THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.256
WHICH IS WHY NONE OF US
CAN BELIEVE

32:04.290 --> 32:06.258
A CHILD RAPIST
LIKE ADELSON

32:06.292 --> 32:07.626
IS ALLOWED OUT ON BAIL!

32:07.659 --> 32:10.129
- ASK YOUR COMPUTER EXPERT,
ERIK WEBER.

32:10.162 --> 32:13.265
MR. ADELSON
WAS RECENTLY ASSAULTED

32:13.299 --> 32:16.435
AFTER COAP'S CREEP TWEETS
RILED UP THE MOB.

32:16.468 --> 32:17.603
THERE'S YOUR QUOTE,
MS. CHANG.

32:17.636 --> 32:18.404
- GO HOME, ERIK.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.006
WE WILL MAKE SURE
THAT ALL EYES--

32:20.039 --> 32:21.974
- THERE HE IS.
MR. ADELSON!

32:22.008 --> 32:22.975
MR. ADELSON!

32:23.009 --> 32:24.610
ANYTHING TO SAY
ABOUT THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU?

32:24.643 --> 32:27.446
[overlapping questions]

32:27.479 --> 32:28.614
- LOUISE!

32:28.647 --> 32:29.648
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN
YOUR CLIENT

32:29.681 --> 32:31.250
WAS A CONVICTED PEDOPHILE?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.052
- MS. FAIRCHILD,
WHAT CHARGES ARE BEING FILED

32:33.085 --> 32:35.621
AGAINST THE POLICE OFFICER
THAT ATTACKED YOUR CLIENT?

32:35.654 --> 32:38.657
[chatter fades]

32:45.631 --> 32:48.067
[tires screech]
- EDWIN!

32:48.100 --> 32:50.002
[honking]
EDWIN!

32:56.275 --> 32:57.543
[horn blaring]

32:57.576 --> 32:59.578
- EVERYBODY BACK!
- BACK!

33:09.621 --> 33:11.257
- OH, MY GOD.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.704
- BUT IN A SHOCKING
TURN OF EVENTS,

33:25.737 --> 33:28.674
REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER
EDWIN ADELSON

33:28.707 --> 33:30.309
ENDED HIS OWN LIFE

33:30.342 --> 33:34.413
RATHER THAN FACE
NEW ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM.

33:34.446 --> 33:35.714
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.183
- LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.151
IF COAP KEEPS THE PRESSURE
UP ON THESE GUYS,

33:39.185 --> 33:41.553
IT'LL SAVE THE STATE A HELL
OF A LOT OF MONEY ON TRIALS.

33:41.587 --> 33:43.622
- IS IT TRUE?

33:43.655 --> 33:47.659
THE MAN'S REALLY...DEAD?

33:47.693 --> 33:48.694
- UH...

33:48.727 --> 33:51.597
YES, MANDY.
IT IS.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.699
HE FELT SO GUILTY
ABOUT WHAT HE DID

33:53.732 --> 33:56.802
THAT HE TOOK
HIS OWN LIFE.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.370
CAN I ASK YOU LADIES
TO COME WITH ME

33:58.404 --> 34:00.739
TO THE INTERVIEW ROOM?

34:00.772 --> 34:01.807
- DETECTIVE STABLER!

34:03.542 --> 34:05.511
- NO TIME, WEBER.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.414
- NOT EVEN
TO RECEIVE EVIDENCE?

34:08.447 --> 34:12.218
UM, THIS HARD DRIVE
CONTAINS ALL THE STUFF

34:12.251 --> 34:17.656
I'VE GATHERED FROM MY...
LITTLE INVESTIGATION.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.558
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
OF THIS STUFF YOU CAN USE,

34:19.591 --> 34:24.263
BUT...I THOUGHT THE REAL COPS
SHOULD HAVE IT.

34:24.296 --> 34:26.598
- THANKS.
- SAFE HORIZON?

34:26.632 --> 34:28.467
- YEAH, THE CITY
PROVIDES VICTIMS

34:28.500 --> 34:30.269
COUNSELING
AND SUPPORT SERVICES.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.770
ANYTHING THAT
YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS,

34:31.803 --> 34:32.871
AND IT'S ALL FOR FREE.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.840
- I NEVER KNEW THAT.

34:34.873 --> 34:38.710
YOU KNOW, THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING ELSE THAT COULD HELP.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.646
HEY, MANDY.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.448
HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO LEARN KARATE?

34:42.481 --> 34:44.383
- COOL.

34:47.586 --> 34:50.189
- HEY, ERIK.
COME HERE FOR A SEC?

34:51.657 --> 34:55.594
OKAY, ERIK WEBER,

34:55.627 --> 34:57.296
- HI.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.865
- ERIK, YOU COULD TEACH MANDY
HOW TO DEFEND HERSELF, RIGHT?

34:59.898 --> 35:01.733
AFTER ALL, SHE'S
A WORLD-CLASS SWIMMER.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.802
- ALWAYS HAPPY
TO HAVE ANOTHER STUDENT.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.271
COME BY ANY TIME.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.206
MY STUDIO'S IN KIPS BAY.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.674
MOM, YOU CAN JOIN TOO.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.376
KARATE'S FOR EVERYONE.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.377
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

35:11.410 --> 35:15.714
DOESN'T IT, HONEY?

35:15.747 --> 35:17.516
- YEAH.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.819
- CALL YOU?

35:20.852 --> 35:22.588
- YEAH.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.323
MANDY?

35:24.356 --> 35:25.791
YOU OKAY?

35:29.661 --> 35:31.297
- CAN WE GO HOME NOW?

35:31.330 --> 35:34.166
- OF COURSE WE CAN, HONEY.

35:35.601 --> 35:36.568
- BYE, DETECTIVE.
- BYE.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.504
TAKE CARE, MANDY.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.281
URINE.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.183
- WHAT HAPPENED?

35:53.719 --> 35:56.788
- MANDY JUST TOLD US
WHO REALLY RAPED HER.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.392
- OLIVIA.
WHAT A SURPRISE.

36:00.426 --> 36:02.294
- WHAT, I CAN'T STOP BY
FOR A GLASS OF WINE?

36:02.328 --> 36:03.795
I THOUGHT OUR FIRST ONE
WENT SO WELL.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.732
- UM, SORRY, HEH.

36:06.765 --> 36:08.634
YOU KNOW, I'M ALL OUT.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.637
LISTEN, OLIVIA,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.705
YOU KNOW, AS MUCH FUN
AS WE HAD THE OTHER NIGHT--

36:13.739 --> 36:15.274
- YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN SEEING ME?

36:15.307 --> 36:16.708
- IT'S NOT YOU.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.810
I'VE JUST BEEN SO WOUND UP

36:18.844 --> 36:21.513
WITH ALL THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH
BUSINESS, IT...

36:21.547 --> 36:23.749
JUST BROUGHT UP SO MANY
PAINFUL MEMORIES ABOUT GRACE.

36:23.782 --> 36:24.616
- I BET.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.818
BESIDES, I'M NOT REALLY
YOUR TYPE, AM I?

36:26.852 --> 36:28.287
I'M A LITTLE OLD, NO?

36:28.320 --> 36:30.256
- [chuckles]
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.358
- THAT'S A LIE, ERIK.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.959
- EXCUSE ME?

36:33.992 --> 36:35.361
- EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE SAID

36:35.394 --> 36:36.762
FROM THE MOMENT THAT WE MET
IS A LIE.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.730
- OKAY...

36:38.764 --> 36:40.566
NOW I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

36:40.599 --> 36:41.800
- WELL, THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.735
RIGHT?

36:43.769 --> 36:45.604
AND THE BIGGEST LIE
OF ALL OF THEM

36:45.637 --> 36:47.539
IS THE ONE ABOUT
HATING PEDOPHILES.

36:47.573 --> 36:48.540
- OKAY, STOP.

36:48.574 --> 36:49.775
- BEING HELL-BENT...

36:49.808 --> 36:51.477
ON WANTING TO ROOT OUT
PEDOPHILES?

36:51.510 --> 36:53.345
- OKAY, DON'T CALL ME THAT!

36:53.379 --> 36:55.814
- I DIDN'T.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.616
THAT'S WEIRD
THAT YOU THOUGHT I DID.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.320
- OKAY, LOOK.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.522
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO DATE YOU--

37:03.555 --> 37:06.792
- TELL THE TRUTH, ERIK.
JUST ONCE, TELL THE TRUTH.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.661
YOU NEVER WANTED TO DATE ME.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.463
YOU JUST WANTED TO SUSS OUT
WHAT THE COPS KNOW.

37:11.497 --> 37:12.498
- [scoffs] WHAT?

37:12.531 --> 37:13.932
- SO YOU SLITHERED UP

37:13.965 --> 37:17.903
AND YOU WHIPPED OUT
YOUR LITTLE PERV POINTER...

37:17.936 --> 37:21.340
AND YOUR DRIVE ANNIHILATOR

37:21.373 --> 37:23.609
TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE WERE WATCHING

37:23.642 --> 37:25.811
THE CREEP DOWN THE STREET...

37:25.844 --> 37:28.046
THE GUY IN THE PARK.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.416
YOU SEE, I THINK
THAT YOU MOVED

37:30.449 --> 37:31.783
INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

37:31.817 --> 37:33.652
ON PURPOSE...

37:33.685 --> 37:35.954
BECAUSE IT'S THE PERFECT COVER
FOR RAPING LITTLE GIRLS.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.556
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:37.589 --> 37:38.790
I REALLY WANT YOU
OUT OF HERE.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.726
- WELL, YOU'RE
THE KARATE EXPERT.

37:40.759 --> 37:41.993
MAKE ME.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.035
- [chuckles]

37:50.068 --> 37:51.403
WHERE YOU GOING, ERIK?

37:51.437 --> 37:54.706
- YOU KNOW,
I'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE.

37:54.740 --> 37:55.907
- [laughs]
AND TELL THEM WHAT?

37:55.941 --> 37:59.411
THAT YOU FINGERED ADELSON
FOR A CRIME THAT YOU COMMITTED?

37:59.445 --> 38:01.680
- HE RAPED
THOSE LITTLE GIRLS!

38:01.713 --> 38:03.649
- IT SURE LOOKED LIKE IT,
DIDN'T IT?

38:03.682 --> 38:04.983
HE WAS A KNOWN OFFENDER.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.418
HE HAD NO ALIBI

38:06.452 --> 38:09.087
WHEN HE DUCKED OUT
IN THE PARK TO READ.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.088
YOU HACKED HIS COMPUTER

38:10.121 --> 38:12.824
AND YOU PLANTED THE IMAGES
OF MANDY AND ROSE

38:12.858 --> 38:14.059
TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE HE TOOK 'EM.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.495
- HE DID IT, OLIVIA.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.430
THAT'S WHY HE KILLED HIMSELF.

38:18.464 --> 38:19.998
- ONLY AFTER
YOU DROVE HIM TO.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.800
LIKE YOU ALMOST DROVE
YOUR SISTER GRACE TO.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.669
- OH, NOW YOU REALLY ARE
LOSING IT.

38:23.702 --> 38:24.670
GRACE HUNG HERSELF!

38:24.703 --> 38:26.772
IN 1982!

38:26.805 --> 38:28.707
- THEN HOW CAN I BE
STANDING RIGHT HERE?

38:42.454 --> 38:43.655
- [whispering] GRACE.

38:43.689 --> 38:44.990
- SHE WAS EASY ENOUGH TO FIND.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.626
JUST RIGHT THERE
IN THE DELAWARE PHONE BOOK.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.528
- BUT YOU NEEDED HER DEAD.

38:49.561 --> 38:50.362
FOR YOUR SOB STORY--

38:50.396 --> 38:53.331
SO NOBODY WOULD PEEK
UNDER THE MASK.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.869
- YOU RAPED ME, ERIK.

38:57.903 --> 39:00.806
YOU CAME INTO MY ROOM...

39:00.839 --> 39:02.741
I WAS ONLY NINE.

39:02.774 --> 39:03.742
- NO.

39:03.775 --> 39:05.644
- THEN YOU TRIED
TO CONVINCE ME

39:05.677 --> 39:08.146
IT WAS JUST A MISTAKE.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.982
YOU SWORE THAT IT
WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.551
- NO.

39:12.584 --> 39:14.853
- BUT YOU KEPT ON RAPIN'.

39:14.886 --> 39:18.123
HOW MANY, ERIK?

39:18.156 --> 39:20.826
HOW MANY OTHER GIRLS' PICTURES
HAVE YOU PAINTED?

39:20.859 --> 39:23.762
- I CAN'T HELP IT!

39:23.795 --> 39:26.031
DON'T YOU SEE, I'M SICK!

39:26.064 --> 39:28.166
I CAN'T CONTROL MYSELF.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.401
- WEBER, TAKE IT EASY.

39:29.435 --> 39:30.702
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

39:30.736 --> 39:33.038
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE!

39:33.071 --> 39:38.810
YOU KNOW, I--
I TRIED SO HARD.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.879
I TRIED SO HARD NOT
TO LOOK AT LITTLE GIRLS.

39:40.912 --> 39:43.515
NOT TO HEAR THEIR VOICES.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.183
I FIGHT AGAINST IT...

39:45.216 --> 39:47.185
I FIGHT AGAINST IT,

39:47.218 --> 39:49.621
AND EVERY TIME,
EVERY TIME IT WINS!

39:49.655 --> 39:51.523
- PLEASE, ENOUGH
WITH YOUR SOB STORY.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.692
- DON'T YOU JUDGE ME,
YOU BITCH.

39:53.725 --> 39:54.960
- TURN AROUND.

39:54.993 --> 39:58.063
- YOU MAKE ME SICK.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.832
EVERY TIME I STAND NEAR YOU,

40:00.866 --> 40:01.800
I HAVE TO HOLD MY BREATH.

40:01.833 --> 40:05.103
- WELL, LOOKY HERE,
HE CAN TELL THE TRUTH.

40:05.136 --> 40:06.137
- UHH! GAH!

40:06.171 --> 40:08.406
- GET BACK!

40:15.981 --> 40:16.948
- GRACE, NO!

40:16.982 --> 40:18.750
- [sobbing]

40:18.784 --> 40:20.452
AAH!

40:26.492 --> 40:28.827
[sobbing]

40:44.776 --> 40:48.780
