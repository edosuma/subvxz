WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:03.336
<i>The Jade box. You have it.</i>

00:03.336 --> 00:04.796
<i>Liam sold it to me.</i>

00:04.796 --> 00:07.882
<i>The same man who killed my brother
killed your father.</i>

00:07.882 --> 00:10.176
<i>A treasure hunter named Salazar.</i>

00:11.261 --> 00:13.972
<i>This medallion we both wear is a promise,</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:16.474
to keep the treasure safe
from men like him.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.352
She kicked my ass.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.106
<i>The well at the Alamo.</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:24.774
Game on.

00:26.985 --> 00:27.944
Jess!

00:30.530 --> 00:31.489
There she is.

00:31.489 --> 00:32.615
Have you got the package?

00:32.615 --> 00:33.742
<i>It's time to deliver it.</i>

00:33.742 --> 00:36.369
So if that third box isn't at the Alamo,
where is it?

00:36.369 --> 00:37.370
Alamo, Mexico.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.999
There's this Mexican town called Viesca
that used to be called "Alamo".

00:40.999 --> 00:43.043
We just poked the bear.
We have to watch our backs.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.461
<i>Billie will show no mercy.</i>

00:48.506 --> 00:49.758
<i>That tea you're drinking?</i>

00:49.758 --> 00:51.176
<i>It's laced with poison.</i>

00:51.176 --> 00:53.720
<i>If you want the antidote, you'll tell me
what I came here for.</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:55.722
<i>Then this secret dies with me.</i>

00:56.639 --> 00:59.559
Judge Ramirez is sending over
the arrest warrant. Good work.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.770
- Now go get Valenzuela.
- Sir.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.897
- I don't know...
- Ross.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.940
We checked the witness out, he's credible.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.485
He was Sadusky's nurse for two years.

01:08.902 --> 01:09.819
Yeah.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.113
You remember when I said
I believed in you?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.533
You can do this.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.202
Thank you, sir.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.000
Okay, uh, let's just,
just take a minute

01:24.000 --> 01:27.545
because, obviously, the adrenaline rush
has gotten to your sane mind.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.673
Jess, Oren and I are perfectly capable
of going to Mexico.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.885
How do you plan on getting the location
of the box from Salazar?

01:33.885 --> 01:35.720
Neither of you even speak Spanish.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.347
But, Jess, let's be real.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.141
If you cross the border,
you can't come back.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.144
Can't Ethan just do some lawyerly stuff?

01:43.144 --> 01:44.562
There's gotta be something
for emergencies.

01:44.562 --> 01:45.480
There is.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.441
For me to legally leave the country,
I'd have to apply for advance parole.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.484
It's called parole?

01:50.151 --> 01:52.362
It's not like you're under arrest.
Who is naming these things?

01:52.362 --> 01:53.947
- Like, read the room.
- Yeah.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.657
And even if it gets approved,

01:55.657 --> 01:57.867
a big "if", it could take months.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.082
Salazar knows where that relic is.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.459
And I'm not gonna let him stop me
from finding that treasure

02:06.459 --> 02:07.710
and proving my mom was right.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.130
But how are you going to do that?

02:12.173 --> 02:13.675
We have the same enemy.

02:13.675 --> 02:14.759
Billie.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.387
He's not gonna want her
to find the treasure either.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.140
I'm gonna make an alliance with him.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.393
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.646
Well, you're not going alone.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.189
Oh, we're gonna need some food.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.524
It's a long drive to Mexico.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.152
Tasha, Oren, I can't ask you guys
to come with me.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.028
Well, good, because we're not asking, either.

02:34.028 --> 02:34.946
We're coming.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.371
The FBI.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.455
- What?
- What?

02:46.457 --> 02:47.834
Are they cleaning out your stuff?

02:48.418 --> 02:49.794
No, they must have a search warrant.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.213
- Jess, your suitcase!
- No, no, no, there's no way.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.464
I scrubbed everything.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.592
There's no way they linked you
to Graceland or the Governor's Ball.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.304
Oh, god.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.182
Jess, you're wanted
for Peter Sadusky's murder.

03:03.224 --> 03:04.225
What?

03:05.310 --> 03:06.686
So he was murdered.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.229
Why do they think you did it?

03:09.355 --> 03:11.191
Let's not stick around to find out.
Let's go.

04:37.026 --> 04:40.571
<i>All detainees remain in this room
until called for your court appearance.</i>

04:41.739 --> 04:43.366
Hey, come on, man. Give me a break.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.118
You wouldn't arrest Davy Crockett,
would you?

04:45.118 --> 04:47.412
- Hey, come on!
- It's David Crockett.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.831
- Just sit down.
- He never called himself "Davy."

04:53.960 --> 04:55.211
Nice costume.

04:56.170 --> 05:00.675
Especially the authentic barrel knot
in the cravat.

05:02.051 --> 05:03.344
You know your stuff.

05:03.845 --> 05:09.183
Only those who truly appreciate history
care about its details, big or small.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.810
Yeah.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.937
Good luck hanging on to that ideology.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.940
What are you detained for?

05:15.940 --> 05:16.983
Me?

05:16.983 --> 05:19.110
I'm just guilty of preaching the truth.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.822
Nobody wants to hear the real history
of the Alamo.

05:23.740 --> 05:24.574
I do.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.285
I delivered it.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.995
<i>You don't sound too happy.</i>

05:28.995 --> 05:30.580
I did what I was told.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.166
<i>Good man. Sending payment now.</i>

05:56.647 --> 05:58.316
Anything on the police scanner yet?

05:59.233 --> 06:01.361
They're still cleaning out our apartment.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.904
Oren, have you heard from Jess?

06:05.156 --> 06:06.491
Really need to talk to her.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.077
She really needs to talk to you, too.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.954
Uh, I'm gonna go check on Oren.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.292
What do you wanna talk about?

06:16.959 --> 06:18.044
What did you need to talk about?

06:19.212 --> 06:20.380
You first.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.095
You don't need all these Nike boxes
to go visit a supervillain.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.306
Well, Jess has her treasure boxes,

06:30.306 --> 06:32.308
I have "in case of" boxes.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.520
"In case of hurricane."

06:37.397 --> 06:39.565
"In case of the tornadoes."

06:39.565 --> 06:40.525
Uh...

06:41.109 --> 06:43.820
"In case of a zombie apocalypse."

06:44.404 --> 06:45.279
It could happen.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.575
And this is in case Jess ever needed
to use that suitcase.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.253
You sold a lot to get all of this.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.629
Yeah.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.631
I can't believe you did all this, Oren.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.136
And burner phones.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.805
You thought of everything.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.723
I do listen to you, you know.

07:14.767 --> 07:15.852
<i>So yeah.</i>

07:16.477 --> 07:18.604
Liam's not the bad guy we thought he was.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.816
I should have known Billie framed him.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.234
Hey...

07:23.860 --> 07:26.362
Did I miss the moment
you've got the power to see all?

07:27.989 --> 07:28.906
Come on.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.409
Billie obviously framed you
for Sadusky's murder,

07:31.409 --> 07:33.244
and the FBI fell for it.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.579
The FBI!

07:35.830 --> 07:38.166
Liam was a victim, just like you were.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.543
Yeah, but...

07:42.044 --> 07:43.504
he could have died!

07:48.426 --> 07:50.761
I wish I could tell him
how sorry I am, but...

07:51.804 --> 07:53.097
I have to go.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.390
"Go"?

07:55.266 --> 07:56.142
Go where?

07:56.142 --> 07:58.728
There must be another well.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.730
The well in the front courtyard
is the only one.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.651
Unless... you're talking
about the original Alamo.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.236
The original?

08:07.236 --> 08:10.823
Everybody thinks the Alamo
is named after the poplar trees.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.534
Because the word poplar is...

08:13.534 --> 08:15.161
- Alamos.
- ..."alamos" in Spanish.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.078
- Yes.
- Right?

08:16.078 --> 08:17.830
But the trees were planted

08:17.830 --> 08:20.791
after the mission became
what we know today.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.669
All thanks to a couple of Spanish soldiers

08:23.669 --> 08:28.799
who named the Alamo
after their hometown in Mexico.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.054
I love it.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.264
I could sit here all day
talking about this.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.142
I know, Mexico...

08:38.142 --> 08:39.393
sounds crazy.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.103
You're gonna tell me not to go.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.022
Two weeks ago, I would have said that.

08:43.022 --> 08:46.317
But after everything we've been through,
it's crazy to say "crazy."

08:46.317 --> 08:47.985
I know you need to do this.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.613
Okay, all packed up.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.533
- You ready?
- Yeah.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.079
If you see Liam...

08:58.079 --> 09:00.039
Don't worry, I'll catch him up.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.251
Jess, I...

09:08.256 --> 09:10.049
I want you to go find that treasure.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.427
I'm gonna lawyer up
and clear your name, okay?

09:14.679 --> 09:15.972
We'll see each other soon.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.475
Pinky swear.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.396
Pinky swear.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.856
Come on, Jess. Party bus is leaving!

09:32.738 --> 09:33.864
Coming.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.784
Oh, my god.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.094
- Ross?
- Mm-hmm.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.387
There's someone here to see you.

09:56.971 --> 09:57.847
Thank you.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.562
I've known Jess my whole life.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.564
There's no way she's capable of murder.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.276
Sometimes, the people we think
we know turn out to be different.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.946
Look, you seem like a good friend,

10:14.530 --> 10:15.823
but I have her confession on tape.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.829
<i>That treasure belongs to my family.</i>

10:21.829 --> 10:23.372
<i>My father gave his life for it.</i>

10:23.372 --> 10:24.332
<i>So did my son.</i>

10:24.332 --> 10:26.500
<i>And you'll give yours, too,
unless you give me that clue.</i>

10:26.500 --> 10:27.627
<i>Are you threatening me?</i>

10:27.627 --> 10:28.919
<i>That tea you're drinking?</i>

10:28.919 --> 10:30.421
<i>It's laced with poison.</i>

10:30.421 --> 10:32.757
<i>If you want the antidote,
you'll tell me what I came here for.</i>

10:32.757 --> 10:34.675
<i>Then this secret dies with me.</i>

10:36.636 --> 10:38.763
<i>You wouldn't let that happen.</i>

10:38.763 --> 10:39.847
<i>Wouldn't I?</i>

10:39.847 --> 10:42.391
<i>That's why I'm having tea
with your grandson next.</i>

10:42.391 --> 10:45.603
<i>His apartment's just a little further down
the road, isn't it?</i>

10:48.939 --> 10:50.107
It's a fake.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.985
It's been analyzed by our experts.

10:52.985 --> 10:56.697
Jess got a perfect score
on her English ACT, first try.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.367
It drove me nuts
because I missed one question.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.576
Usage error.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.204
"Further" versus "farther."

11:03.829 --> 11:05.498
The right word here is "farther"

11:05.498 --> 11:07.583
since it's a physical,
measurable distance.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.753
But that's not what the fake Jess
on your fake tape said.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.840
So you're suggesting grammar as an alibi?

11:16.050 --> 11:17.968
You've never heard of "let's eat grandma"?

11:19.553 --> 11:22.682
You forget to put the comma in
and Grandma's a goner.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.558
Where did you get this?

11:24.558 --> 11:26.435
It was Billie Pearce, wasn't it?

11:26.435 --> 11:27.895
She's British.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.064
They use "further" instead of "farther."

11:30.690 --> 11:32.650
Actually, it wasn't Billie Pearce.

11:32.650 --> 11:33.734
Then who?

11:33.734 --> 11:37.780
Sorry, I can't divulge details
of an ongoing investigation.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.240
And you know that.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.742
Fine.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.416
Here's the file report.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.043
They've identified the blonde woman
on the USS Kidd for you.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.255
Billie Pearce, and she was just arrested
at the Alamo.

12:29.999 --> 12:30.958
Jess.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.505
I cannot believe that Jess lied to us
about the Alamo.

12:36.505 --> 12:39.133
She didn't lie to us
about the Alamo.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.302
Just which one.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.928
Wait, there's a second Alamo?

12:42.928 --> 12:46.182
Hi. Agent Ross, FBI,
Baton Rouge Field Office.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.018
You're the reason why they detained me
for so long?

12:50.060 --> 12:51.937
Must be a big case for you
to come all this way.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.856
Actually, it is.
We're looking for a fugitive,

12:53.856 --> 12:55.316
I was hoping you could help.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.026
Her name's Jess Valenzuela.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.944
I know you've had contact with her.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.030
In fact, I have pictures of you and her

13:01.030 --> 13:03.032
- at the USS Kidd.
- You don't need to show me pictures.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.658
I know who she is.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.745
She approached me for some business advice

13:07.745 --> 13:10.206
and I said she could shadow me
for a few days.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.833
But no good deed goes unpunished.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.835
She's the reason why I got arrested.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.087
So now she's a fugitive.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.339
May I ask, what did she do?

13:18.339 --> 13:19.548
She's a murder suspect.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.051
Wow.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.387
Seems like I dodged a bullet.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.848
Good luck.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.899
Do hope your next lead doesn't take you
even further away from home.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.926
This is it.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.096
It's not too late, Jess.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.521
Keep going.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.529
Let's hope your name
hasn't hit Interpol yet.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.034
Passports, please.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.805
<i>Bienvenida a casa.</i>

14:53.225 --> 14:54.351
Go ahead.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.187
What did he say to you?

14:58.772 --> 14:59.815
"Welcome home."

15:19.543 --> 15:20.502
What's up, baby?

15:38.479 --> 15:41.607
<i>Hey! Sorry, I missed you,
but let me know what you need.</i>

15:41.607 --> 15:42.816
Hey.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.777
I was really hoping to hear your voice.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.403
Where are you?

15:47.363 --> 15:49.156
Please, I need to know you're okay.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.328
Been trying to call you.

15:56.538 --> 15:57.831
I lost my phone.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.750
Look, have you seen Jess?

15:59.750 --> 16:01.001
Who has?

16:01.001 --> 16:02.836
She missed her last four shifts.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.589
Oh, and some guy named Ethan came by
looking for you.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.924
Did he leave a number?

16:06.924 --> 16:08.217
No.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.885
What is he, a manager or something?

16:09.885 --> 16:11.845
What? No. Uh...

16:11.845 --> 16:14.848
Look, I know it's not Friday,
but I really need my check.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.976
I gotta get a new phone.
My old one took a swim.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.271
Wow. You, uh... you really have no idea.

16:21.939 --> 16:22.940
What?

16:22.940 --> 16:25.859
Your little stunt in Graceland,
it's all over the Internet.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.570
All these people are here to see you play.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.116
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.829
I...

16:36.829 --> 16:38.622
Got, I got, I got something
more important to do, I'm sorry.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.791
I'll give you a grand for one song.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.547
Cash.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.437
I...

17:02.521 --> 17:04.982
I wanna try something
I've never done before.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.317
I, um...

17:09.069 --> 17:11.030
I wrote this about someone that...

17:12.823 --> 17:16.160
Well, I guess you can just hear it
in the song.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.296
<i>♪ Wouldn't want nobody else ♪</i>

17:27.296 --> 17:29.757
<i>♪ Calling me up late on a Friday ♪</i>

17:29.757 --> 17:32.885

18:06.293 --> 18:07.169
How's this?

18:07.878 --> 18:10.589
It's giving Rachel Maddow. I love it.

18:11.173 --> 18:14.468
Okay, so prison visiting hours tomorrow
are from 10 to 2.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.053
Great.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.066
My mom used to play this for me
all the time.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.029
This must be so hard for you, Jess.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.198
Yeah.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.325
It's weird.

18:39.409 --> 18:42.204
It's like everything feels so familiar,
but also not.

18:44.706 --> 18:45.541
Em...

18:49.002 --> 18:52.256
I speak English if that would be
more comfortable for you.

18:52.881 --> 18:53.799
Oh.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.092
Sure.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.677
I have the perfect blouse.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.178
I'll be right back. Mm-hmm?

18:59.388 --> 19:00.556
How did she know?

19:01.682 --> 19:03.725
Your Spanish sounds pretty Spanish to me.

19:04.393 --> 19:10.107
I guess I'm too Mexican for the US
and too American for Mexico.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.651
Hey, don't let her kill your vibe.

19:12.651 --> 19:13.735
Okay?

19:13.735 --> 19:15.821
We have to get our heads
in the game. It's fine.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.323
Here you go.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.745
That's perfect, thank you.

19:25.622 --> 19:29.459
Do you happen to know
of any hotels nearby?

19:29.459 --> 19:30.961
We're on a budget.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.714
<i>♪ Beside me ♪</i>

19:36.049 --> 19:39.094
<i>♪ Besides you ♪</i>

20:19.259 --> 20:21.011
I wanted to talk to you in private.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.346
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey...

20:23.805 --> 20:25.307
You were with that red-headed woman.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.391
You helped her throw me in the river!

20:26.391 --> 20:28.435
I... I saved you.

20:28.435 --> 20:29.978
I pulled you out.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.320
Come on, bud. Liam.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.821
Liam, stay with me, bud.

20:39.821 --> 20:41.031
Keep your eyes open.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.412
Why did you save me?

20:48.038 --> 20:49.748
Billie's gone too far.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.875
I, I thought she'd just beat you up
for the journal,

20:51.875 --> 20:53.627
I didn't think she'd try to kill you.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.171
And now she's framing Jess for the murder
of your grandfather.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.339
Wait.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.632
My grandpa was murdered?

21:00.676 --> 21:01.635
I gotta find Jess.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.220
Let me help you find her.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.388
Wait, you know where she is?

21:04.388 --> 21:05.514
No.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.474
But Billie will.

21:07.474 --> 21:08.809
And that's why I came here today.

21:08.809 --> 21:11.687
I think Jess is in trouble,
but I know how we can help her.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.146
"We?"

21:13.146 --> 21:14.690
Forget it, man.

21:14.690 --> 21:15.857
You were the mole all along.

21:15.857 --> 21:17.776
I'd be an idiot to trust you.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.028
Hey!

21:20.612 --> 21:21.822
You might want this.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.201
It fell out of your pocket
when we loaded you in the SUV.

21:26.201 --> 21:27.494
Sorry.

21:28.328 --> 21:29.413
I didn't have a charger.

21:36.003 --> 21:39.131
You did not just use your toothbrush
to clean your shoes, Oren.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.966
- This is my backup.
- Mm.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.343
Leading sneakerheads recommend
brushing twice a day.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.264
She couldn't have found us that fast,
could she?

21:47.264 --> 21:49.141
Never underestimate Billie.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.811
- Oren.
- Hey, relax, my dudes.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.272
Hey.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.024
Ethan.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.775
What are you doing here?

21:58.775 --> 22:00.235
And how did you find us?

22:00.235 --> 22:01.987
And were you followed, Ethan? Hi.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.989
Oren texted me, and no.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.449
I've been super careful.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.784
I even booked the flight
with my buddy's miles.

22:07.784 --> 22:10.162
I just figured we'd all be safer together.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.913
We gotta watch our backs.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.582
Billie made a deepfake.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.167
Of what?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.044
Incriminating Jess.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.920
- Yeah.
- Okay.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.340
I'll see if I can access that audio file.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.886
Billie Pearce made a very specific
usage error in our meeting.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.471
"Further" versus "farther."

22:27.471 --> 22:29.931
That matches the one in the tape
incriminating Valenzuela.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.141
She's British.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.768
And the British don't use "farther"
at all?

22:32.768 --> 22:34.770
- Right.
- Okay.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.022
What's Billie Pearce's motive here?

22:37.022 --> 22:40.025
Everything I've found so far points to--

22:40.025 --> 22:41.193
Points to what?

22:43.904 --> 22:46.114
Points to a treasure hunt.

22:46.114 --> 22:48.033
I know how that sounds.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.826
But I believe Valenzuela's innocent.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.371
You have a taped conversation.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.789
That's as good as a confession.

22:53.789 --> 22:54.956
Right, but if I could just request

22:54.956 --> 22:56.041
- more time, I--
- I'm trying...

22:56.041 --> 22:57.667
to help you out here.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.253
I know what happened in DC.

23:00.253 --> 23:01.713
I know you made the wrong call.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.715
I know you don't wanna arrest
the wrong person.

23:03.715 --> 23:06.385
Valenzuela's guilty,
we need to get her off the street.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.471
Just get your career back on track.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.139
Hey, you're talented, Agent Ross.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.394
Find her.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.603
Make the arrest.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.026
<i>That tea you're drinking?
It's laced with poison.</i>

23:23.026 --> 23:25.862
<i>If you want the antidote, you'll tell me
what I came here for.</i>

23:25.862 --> 23:28.448
Well, at least this confirms Billie's
really behind this.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.785
Y'all, she has access to all
of the new technology out there.

23:31.785 --> 23:34.037
I mean, voice mimicry, deepfakes.

23:34.037 --> 23:37.249
I mean, she could have Santa Claus saying
he hates Christmas if she wanted.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.959
That woman is ruthless.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.545
That's it.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.297
That's how we get Salazar to talk.

23:44.297 --> 23:48.051
With the awesome but increasingly
frightening power of technology?

23:48.051 --> 23:51.805
I was gonna try to convince Salazar
to align with me instead of Billie

23:51.805 --> 23:54.141
but now I have a better idea.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.144
I'm gonna use Billie as a threat.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.562
Salazar killed her brother.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.897
If she finds out where he is,
she'll have him killed.

24:00.897 --> 24:04.943
Unless Salazar tells you the location
of the third box.

24:06.486 --> 24:08.196
Well, let's hope
he doesn't call your bluff.

24:18.373 --> 24:21.710
So I couldn't find anything
on Diego Salazar.

24:21.710 --> 24:24.713
The man has zero digital footprint.

24:25.213 --> 24:27.716
Yeah, there was nothing
in his court records either.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.510
No family, no previous record, no ID.

24:30.510 --> 24:31.845
- Mm.
- It's like he's a ghost.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.930
Oh. One more thing.

24:43.648 --> 24:44.566
I buy it.

25:53.969 --> 25:56.638
Hey, look. Where is this guy going?

25:56.638 --> 25:59.849
- Salazar has a visitor.
- Must be someone important.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.893
Really?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.233
Where are you going, Salazar?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.479
My father died in a fire.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.522
- No.
- Trying to get away from you.

27:29.522 --> 27:30.690
No.

27:31.399 --> 27:32.817
No, I got out of that fire.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.820
I'm Rafael.

27:35.820 --> 27:36.905
Your dad.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.741
Your mom, Manuela, is my wife.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.536
And you're my daughter, Jessita.

27:43.536 --> 27:44.621
Really?

27:46.456 --> 27:51.169
Because last time I checked,
your name was Salazar.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.587
No...

27:53.296 --> 27:55.548
I got arrested for breaking into a bank,

27:55.548 --> 27:57.092
but not to rob it.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.427
They assumed I was Salazar.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.722
But if you didn't know I was here...

28:04.933 --> 28:06.476
you came to talk to Salazar.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.271
You're on the treasure hunt.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.191
I came here...

28:14.109 --> 28:18.655
to confront the man who killed my father.

28:19.322 --> 28:22.575
And you have the nerve
to pretend to be him.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.285
I'm not pretending.

28:33.878 --> 28:39.926
<i>♪ Sleep, precious child ♪</i>

28:39.926 --> 28:42.178
We used to sing that to you all the time.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.474
It's from my mother's hometown.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.439
Dad?

28:53.273 --> 28:54.357
Yes.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.401
It's me.

29:00.238 --> 29:02.824
I see your mother gave you
the obsidian relic.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.453
She didn't give me anything.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.122
How did you know
about the relic in Viesca?

29:09.122 --> 29:11.249
Why didn't you try to find us?

29:11.249 --> 29:12.375
I couldn't.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.961
I had to keep you safe
from the real Salazar.

29:14.961 --> 29:17.130
But I knew your mother will come around.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.549
I'm glad she told you all of this.

29:19.549 --> 29:22.260
She didn't tell me anything.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.095
I don't understand.

29:25.805 --> 29:27.182
Where is she?

29:29.976 --> 29:31.561
She died last year.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.189
Of cancer.

29:44.866 --> 29:45.909
I should have been there.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.746
Yeah, you should have!

29:50.747 --> 29:52.791
But you chose to be here.

29:53.625 --> 29:57.253
Under an alias,
a thousand miles away from us.

29:57.837 --> 29:59.589
We had no idea you were alive!

29:59.589 --> 30:02.050
Jessita, I had no choice.

30:02.675 --> 30:04.260
But you must understand,

30:04.260 --> 30:08.014
this treasure is more important
than any one person's life,

30:08.014 --> 30:09.766
- mine or your mother's.
- Really?

30:11.434 --> 30:15.188
Because I was raised to believe that
nothing is more important than family.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.398
That's not true.

30:17.398 --> 30:20.610
This treasure is thousands of years
of lost heritage.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.278
Your heritage.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.947
My heritage.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.615
The truth of Malinche.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.076
Your mother believed it, too.

30:28.409 --> 30:31.663
My mother never mentioned the treasure.

30:33.414 --> 30:36.668
But she did tell me that you were
a reckless good-for-nothing.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.504
And I didn't believe her.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.090
Jessita, you can't give up
on the treasure.

30:42.507 --> 30:43.883
You can still find it.

30:43.883 --> 30:45.593
It was my duty. And now, it's yours.

30:45.593 --> 30:47.554
You haven't listened to a word I've said.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.138
Have you?

30:49.138 --> 30:51.391
Look, I went to the well in Viesca.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.726
The lapis lazuli relic was missing.

30:53.726 --> 30:55.478
Treasure hunters got wind of it.

30:56.145 --> 30:58.523
And then the Daughters
of the Plumed Serpent moved it.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.985
I've had 20 years to figure out
where it was hidden.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.113
Go to the place where
the first Queen of Spain

31:05.113 --> 31:06.948
met with Saint Jerome and passed notes.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.741
I said I'm done!

31:10.243 --> 31:11.911
That's enough!

31:12.704 --> 31:14.956
And if you made it this far,
then you're like me.

31:14.956 --> 31:18.084
You don't quit, and you finish
what you started.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.544
You don't know me!

31:21.004 --> 31:22.088
You're like me.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.008
Yeah, you won't quit.
You finish what you started!

31:25.008 --> 31:26.384
Jessita, don't quit!

31:26.384 --> 31:27.719
Finish what you started!

31:27.719 --> 31:30.763
I can't believe your dad's
been alive all these years.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.850
I can't believe
he never tried to reach you.

31:35.101 --> 31:38.605
I can't believe I did exactly
what my mom warned me against.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.276
I blew up my life for the treasure.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.862
Just like he did.

31:46.863 --> 31:49.115
No, maybe I should just turn myself in
for a murder I didn't commit

31:49.115 --> 31:50.033
and get extradited.

31:50.533 --> 31:51.826
What's the worst that could happen?

31:51.826 --> 31:53.620
Consecutive life sentences?

31:53.620 --> 31:55.580
Well, there's nowhere to go
but up after that, right?

31:56.164 --> 31:57.707
What about the treasure?

31:57.707 --> 31:59.334
That treasure ruined my life.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.294
Billie can have it.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.259
Go ahead.

32:09.552 --> 32:10.470
Jess, come on.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.597
You can't quit now. You...

32:14.515 --> 32:16.434
You've come too far.

32:23.566 --> 32:27.320
No matter what I do or accomplish...

32:29.906 --> 32:32.825
there's always this weight
sitting on my chest.

32:32.825 --> 32:36.204
Asking me if I'm living up
to what my mom sacrificed for me.

32:38.831 --> 32:41.209
And finding the treasure.

32:41.834 --> 32:44.003
And bringing Malinche's truth to light.

32:46.339 --> 32:49.384
I finally felt like I was honoring
everything she gave up.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.888
So what's changed?

32:54.681 --> 32:57.183
I mean, yes, your dad turned out to be...

32:57.183 --> 32:58.977
Everything my mom says he was?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.436
Jess, listen.

33:00.436 --> 33:02.939
Ever since you found that relic
in the Masonic Lodge,

33:02.939 --> 33:07.193
you've had a sense of purpose
I haven't seen in you since your mom died.

33:07.193 --> 33:08.695
If you ask me...

33:11.572 --> 33:12.865
You were born to do this.

33:25.211 --> 33:26.212
So we can do this, y'all.

33:26.212 --> 33:29.298
We just need to find the place where, uh,

33:29.298 --> 33:30.591
what did your dad say?

33:30.591 --> 33:35.596
"The place where the first Queen of Spain
and Saint Jerome met and passed notes."

33:35.596 --> 33:37.974
Well, that's impossible. They never met.

33:37.974 --> 33:41.728
Saint Jerome died in a monastery
in Bethlehem in 420 CE.

33:41.728 --> 33:44.814
And Queen Isabella wasn't born
until 1,000 years later.

33:44.814 --> 33:45.857
Okay, hear me out.

33:45.857 --> 33:49.235
What if the two names are an anagram?

33:51.112 --> 33:52.238
Oren's right.

33:52.238 --> 33:54.157
- I am?
- He is?

33:54.157 --> 33:56.075
Not about an anagram.

33:56.075 --> 34:00.329
My dad was probably talking in code
because the guards could hear us.

34:00.329 --> 34:05.752
So... he didn't mean Queen Isabella
and Saint Jerome actually met.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.795
"Met" means something else.

34:07.795 --> 34:08.880
Met.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.840
Meet, connect,

34:10.840 --> 34:11.758
intersect?

34:11.758 --> 34:13.801
Intersect. Yes, that's something.

34:13.801 --> 34:16.387
An intersection, a place
where two streets meet.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.056
And Mexico City...

34:18.056 --> 34:20.516
has a street named after Queen Isabella.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.226
What about Saint Jerome?

34:24.395 --> 34:25.730
No.

34:25.730 --> 34:29.025
I'm sorry, not to repeat myself,
but we are skipping lunch, yes?

34:36.532 --> 34:39.619
<i>Okay, you're ghosting me. I get it.</i>

34:39.619 --> 34:41.662
<i>But that dance wasn't
what you thought it was.</i>

34:42.997 --> 34:43.956
<i>Listen.</i>

34:45.083 --> 34:46.876
<i>I wasn't looking for a relationship.</i>

34:46.876 --> 34:48.753
<i>I haven't been for a minute.</i>

34:48.753 --> 34:51.631
<i>But since we started this treasure hunt,
everything's changed.</i>

34:52.340 --> 34:53.925
<i>I know we just met.</i>

34:53.925 --> 34:56.052
<i>Like, I'm not crazy, right?</i>

34:56.052 --> 34:57.762
<i>There's a pretty deep connection here?</i>

34:58.679 --> 35:00.556
Anyways, I know I'm rambling.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.935
But can we please just finish
what we started?

35:04.727 --> 35:05.686
Find me.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.197
<i>Hey!</i>

35:16.197 --> 35:18.866
<i>Sorry, I missed you,
but let me know what you need.</i>

35:42.390 --> 35:44.642
Try "San Jerónimo."
That's how he's known in Mexico.

35:46.853 --> 35:47.979
Bingo!

35:48.938 --> 35:51.482
And the two streets intersect.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.026
What's that building on the corner?

35:54.694 --> 35:58.614
That is the University
of the Cloister of Sor Juana,

35:58.614 --> 36:01.159
formerly the San Jerónimo Convent.

36:01.159 --> 36:05.288
Best known for having been the home
of a nun named Sor Juana in the 1600s.

36:05.288 --> 36:07.498
Okay, Sor Juana wasn't only a nun.

36:07.498 --> 36:10.501
She was also
an accomplished playwright, poet.

36:10.501 --> 36:14.797
And she was hailed by modern scholars
as the first feminist in the New World.

36:14.797 --> 36:17.341
So maybe she was
a Daughter of the Plumed Serpent.

36:19.677 --> 36:22.346
This has to be the place
my dad was talking about.

36:22.346 --> 36:26.100
Hiding a relic in a convent
is the best hiding place.

36:27.393 --> 36:31.397
What? All of the treasure-hunting
conquistadors were dudes.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.108
No men allowed in convents.

36:35.610 --> 36:36.777
Hmm... Huh...

36:37.945 --> 36:39.405
Can we eat now?

36:40.740 --> 36:44.160
My dad said, "Go to the place
where they met and passed notes."

36:44.160 --> 36:46.829
Like secret notes, saying
where Sor Juana hid the relic?

36:46.829 --> 36:48.664
I don't think my dad
was being literal.

36:48.664 --> 36:50.082
Good point.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.793
"Passed notes" could be a code
for something else, too.

36:53.419 --> 36:56.130
My family's pretty much the enigma code
I'm always trying to crack.

36:57.423 --> 37:01.135
As a child, Sor Juana spent
most of her time in the library.

37:01.135 --> 37:03.512
She taught herself Greek and Latin

37:03.512 --> 37:07.266
and was even rumored to have corresponded
with Sir Isaac Newton.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.268
Almost everything in here could be a clue.

37:10.436 --> 37:12.521
But by age 17,

37:12.521 --> 37:14.649
Sor Juana was given a choice.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.401
Marry a man or become a nun.

37:17.401 --> 37:18.653
She chose God

37:18.653 --> 37:22.698
and spent most of the remainder
of her life in the convent.

37:22.698 --> 37:27.954
She eventually amassed the biggest library
in all of Spanish America.

37:27.954 --> 37:29.121
She had a library.

37:29.121 --> 37:30.748
It's the perfect place to hide a note.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.208
But...

37:32.792 --> 37:36.796
Sor Juana's feminist writings
became a threat to the Church.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.840
So she was ultimately exiled

37:39.840 --> 37:41.676
and her writings were burned.

37:42.510 --> 37:46.931
Fortunately, scholars have managed
to recover some of her writings,

37:46.931 --> 37:49.976
as well as some of the instruments
she played.

37:50.559 --> 37:53.854
Including the old organ in this chapel,

37:53.854 --> 37:56.274
which was refurbished in the 1970s.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.069
Now, if you would follow me.

38:10.037 --> 38:12.164
Sor Juana played music.

38:12.665 --> 38:13.624
"Passed notes."

38:13.624 --> 38:15.334
Like, musical notes.

38:15.334 --> 38:18.504
Secret societies like the Masons
hid clues in plain sight.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.633
But maybe the Daughters
of the Plumed Serpent

38:22.633 --> 38:25.052
hid a clue in plain sound?

38:26.929 --> 38:28.180
Someone watch the door.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.598
Mm.

38:29.598 --> 38:30.766
On nun watch.

38:34.228 --> 38:35.980
Think the relic's hidden inside the organ?

38:35.980 --> 38:37.815
It's the only thing big enough.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.358
Yeah, but where?

38:40.568 --> 38:42.862
The nun said the organ was refurbished
in the '70s.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.697
What if the relic was found already?

38:50.828 --> 38:52.079
Hold up!

38:56.792 --> 38:58.711
Okay, we're clear.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.423
Guys, this organ was played
for hundreds of years.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.592
If one of these notes sets off
a secret compartment,

39:04.592 --> 39:07.803
how could they make sure
no one accidentally opened it?

39:07.803 --> 39:08.721
Right.

39:09.305 --> 39:12.099
That's why it would have to be
a specific combination of notes.

39:13.392 --> 39:16.312
A song that only the Daughters
of the Plumed Serpent knew,

39:16.312 --> 39:17.688
like Sor Juana.

39:19.482 --> 39:20.941
Your mom's lullaby.

39:24.278 --> 39:26.238
<i>♪ Sleep... ♪</i>

39:26.238 --> 39:28.199
<i>♪ Precious child ♪</i>

39:28.199 --> 39:29.492
Here, I got it.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.995
Ten years of piano lessons.
Sing that again?

39:33.579 --> 39:35.623
<i>♪ Sleep ♪</i>

39:35.623 --> 39:40.086
<i>♪ Precious child ♪</i>

39:40.086 --> 39:45.800

39:51.847 --> 39:54.850

39:54.850 --> 39:56.602
Y'all? There is a...

39:56.602 --> 39:59.522
There is a flock of nuns outside.

39:59.522 --> 40:00.856
Well, stall them!

40:01.440 --> 40:03.526
I can't lie! They're nuns!

40:05.528 --> 40:06.529
Play it again.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.659
They're coming!

40:22.169 --> 40:27.758
<i>♪ Sleep, precious child ♪</i>

40:34.598 --> 40:38.644
<i>♪ Rest, my love ♪</i>

40:40.646 --> 40:41.480
What?

40:48.821 --> 40:49.864
Whoa.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.574
A secret compartment.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.000
Anything?

41:07.089 --> 41:08.048
Ah.

41:14.555 --> 41:15.931
What is happening in there?

41:15.931 --> 41:17.308
Who's playing the organ?

41:17.308 --> 41:18.434
So, so you see?

41:18.559 --> 41:21.896
My friends are just trying to find a clue

41:21.896 --> 41:24.231
to an ancient treasure
hidden by Sor Juana.

41:26.358 --> 41:29.195
Okay. Um... Oh...

41:29.904 --> 41:32.490
- Uh, don't keep me dancing, come on, hey.
- Uh, uh, mm-mm.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.074
Sorry, yup, okay.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.917
What do you have there?

42:24.959 --> 42:26.252
Thank you!

42:30.673 --> 42:31.840
Gracias.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.552
Um, what just happened?

42:39.515 --> 42:40.599
I can't believe it.

42:40.599 --> 42:42.351
Aztec, Incan, and Mayan.

42:42.351 --> 42:44.728
We finally have all three of them.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.439
So what are we doing just staring at them?

42:48.107 --> 42:49.441
Jess, open them.

42:55.906 --> 42:58.242
Okay. That's it.

43:00.744 --> 43:01.996
Oh.

43:01.996 --> 43:04.081
X totally marks the spot.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.875
Yeah, but where is the spot?

43:06.875 --> 43:08.210
Near a tree?

43:08.210 --> 43:09.837
By the river?

43:09.837 --> 43:12.131
What are these feet going in circle mean?

43:13.966 --> 43:15.509
It's like it's written in code.

43:15.509 --> 43:17.678
Another code? Are you kidding?

43:17.678 --> 43:18.929
There's an X.

43:19.471 --> 43:22.308
Well, I don't recognize
any of those symbols.

43:24.977 --> 43:26.812
I know you don't wanna hear this, but...

43:27.229 --> 43:29.565
your dad probably knows
how to read that map.

43:43.746 --> 43:44.830
Hey.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.001
I like the new song.

43:49.501 --> 43:51.003
It's about Jess, right?

43:51.003 --> 43:53.005
Look, let's make one thing
perfectly clear.

43:54.089 --> 43:55.299
I'm not here to be friends.

43:56.133 --> 43:57.092
Okay.

43:57.092 --> 43:58.802
I'm here because somehow,

43:58.802 --> 44:01.639
in this messed up irony that is my life...

44:02.348 --> 44:04.391
You're the only chance
I have to save Jess.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.018
End of story.

44:09.146 --> 44:12.232
I think it might be better
if we just get to know each other.

44:14.276 --> 44:16.862
Two days ago, I thought you were
my grandpa's nurse.

44:17.571 --> 44:19.239
Now I learn you work for Billie?

44:21.116 --> 44:22.701
I think I know you pretty well.

44:23.577 --> 44:24.953
You can't be trusted.

44:25.579 --> 44:26.664
I get that.

44:27.456 --> 44:29.041
I get that.

44:29.708 --> 44:30.834
But...

44:32.127 --> 44:33.379
you gotta trust me, Liam.

44:36.757 --> 44:38.258
I might need another beer.

44:39.802 --> 44:40.886
Me too.

44:49.478 --> 44:51.313
Okay. Wish me luck.

44:55.317 --> 44:58.445
SANTIAGO APOSTOL PENITENTIARY

45:14.712 --> 45:15.921
Calm down.

45:19.508 --> 45:20.592
Jessita!

45:27.933 --> 45:30.310
Well, look who came back from the dead.

45:34.148 --> 45:35.065
We have to leave.

45:35.065 --> 45:35.983
What happened?

45:35.983 --> 45:37.526
I just saw Billie in the lobby.

45:37.526 --> 45:38.610
What?

45:38.610 --> 45:41.071
- What?
- She must've figured out Salazar is here.

45:44.074 --> 45:48.162
And now she's gonna see
it's not Salazar, it's Rafael.

45:50.164 --> 45:51.957
No, I gotta do something.

45:52.458 --> 45:54.918
Jess, no.

45:54.918 --> 45:56.295
I've seen that look before.

45:56.295 --> 45:59.256
You're about to do something crazy
and out of pocket.

45:59.256 --> 46:01.467
Billie tried to drown Liam over a journal.

46:02.134 --> 46:03.969
If she figures out
it's my father in there,

46:03.969 --> 46:05.804
she's gonna find a way to get him killed.

46:06.555 --> 46:07.973
There's only one way to stop her.

46:09.057 --> 46:11.059
You cannot be serious.

46:12.352 --> 46:13.896
Jess, you can't do it.

46:15.439 --> 46:16.982
I'm gonna break him out.

46:16.982 --> 46:18.233
What?

46:21.945 --> 46:23.739
I'm gonna break my father out of prison.
