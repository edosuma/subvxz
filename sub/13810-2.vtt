09:40.121 --> 09:44.166
{\an1}MAURICE, WE HAVE
SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.503
I KNOW, I KNOW,
YOU'RE SENDING ME AWAY

09:47.586 --> 09:52.091

AUNT CLEOTILDA AND
IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

09:52.174 --> 09:54.176
WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT IDEA?

09:54.260 --> 09:56.929
{\an5}I HEARD YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT MOVERS
TAKING MY FURNITURE.

09:57.013 --> 10:01.600
{\an5}THEN LARS TOLD ME
YOU WERE SENDING ME AWAY
BECAUSE OF SOMETHING I DID.

10:01.684 --> 10:02.685
LARS TOLD YOU THAT,
HUH?

10:02.768 --> 10:06.480
{\an5}RIGHT AFTER HE TOLD ME
ABOUT THE SUITCASE
FULL OF MONEY

10:06.564 --> 10:08.524
THAT'S STILL BURIED
IN THE BACKYARD.

10:08.607 --> 10:09.900
NEVER FOUND IT.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.528
OH, HONEY, THE MOVERS

10:12.611 --> 10:15.573
{\an1}ARE JUST TAKING
YOUR OLD BEDROOM FURNITURE

10:15.656 --> 10:19.160

YOUR NEW BEDROOM FURNITURE.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.953

WE CAN STILL BE
BEST BUDS.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.629
SO YOU CAN
STOP CRYING NOW.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.674
(<i> laughing</i> )

11:15.758 --> 11:18.135
CAN WE STOP TALKING
ABOUT THAT?

11:18.219 --> 11:20.304
I WAS NOT CRYING.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.598

11:24.058 --> 11:26.310
JUT BE GLAD WE DID

11:26.394 --> 11:30.106
{\an1}RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST GLAD
I'M NOT LARS.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.690
MAKE IT BIGGER!

11:31.774 --> 11:36.153
{\an1}Otto:
OH, LARS, WE NEED MORE JUMPAGE.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.572

11:43.994 --> 11:47.915

12:10.521 --> 12:11.772
Otto:

12:13.607 --> 12:15.860

12:20.364 --> 12:22.741
(<i> grunting</i> )

12:22.825 --> 12:24.952
(<i> laughs</i> )
CHECK IT OUT--

12:25.035 --> 12:26.454
SQUISHED SQUID.

12:26.537 --> 12:27.872
ALOHA.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.415
NICE TO SEE YOU, TITO...

12:29.498 --> 12:31.000
BUT NOT FROM THIS ANGLE.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.418
YOU'RE NOT
WORKING TODAY.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.587
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

12:34.670 --> 12:35.963
BROTHER, I'M THINKING

12:36.046 --> 12:37.548
WE CLOSE UP THE SALT MINE

12:37.631 --> 12:40.259
AND TAKE THE PRISONERS
TO THE PROMISED LAND.

12:40.342 --> 12:44.221
PROMISED LAND? YOU MEAN
THE... SECRET SPOT?

12:44.305 --> 12:45.097
(<i> all gasp</i> )

12:45.181 --> 12:48.517
THE SECRET SPOT?
WITH THE PERFECT WAVES?

12:48.601 --> 12:51.020
THE SECRET SPOT THAT
NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT?

12:51.103 --> 12:53.814
{\an5}THE SECRET SPOT
THAT YOU AND TWISTER
TOLD EVERYBODY ABOUT?

12:55.649 --> 12:58.569
{\an1}SURF'S LOOKING MIGHTY NICE
TODAY, BROTHER.

12:58.652 --> 13:01.197
{\an1}I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD
TALK YOU AND THE GANG

13:01.280 --> 13:02.865
INTO A LITTLE
AFTERNOON SESSION.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.702
YOU KNOW, FOR THE OLD
HAWAIIAN BROTHER'S SAKE?

13:06.785 --> 13:08.370
{\an1}All:
CAN WE, CAN WE?

13:08.454 --> 13:10.289
PLEASE...

13:10.372 --> 13:11.832
{\an3}WELL...

13:11.916 --> 13:14.543

13:14.627 --> 13:16.003

13:16.086 --> 13:18.881
{\an5}JUST NEED A LITTLE

THANK YOU... COME AGAIN.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.277

(<i> laughs</i> )

13:44.114 --> 13:45.741
{\an1}OOH...

13:45.824 --> 13:46.033
Kids:

13:52.206 --> 13:53.958
WHAT A ZOO.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.585
WHAT HAPPENED
TO OUR SECRET SPOT?

13:56.669 --> 13:58.379
{\an1}LOOKS LIKE
THE SECRET'S OUT.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.673
ARE THERE GOING TO BE
ENOUGH WAVES FOR US?

14:00.756 --> 14:02.591
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THERE'S ENOUGH WAVES FOR THEM.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.636
{\an1}AW, THESE ARE
MY OLD STOMPING GROUNDS.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.764
DON'T WORRY-- ONCE THEY SEE
OLD RAY AND TITO PADDLE OUT

14:08.847 --> 14:11.433
I'M SURE THEY WILL TOTALLY
HOOK US UP WITH SOME WAVES.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.560
YOU GO AHEAD, BROTHER RAY.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.688
I'M GOING TO SET UP CAMP FIRST.

14:15.771 --> 14:16.981
HEY, ANYBODY UP
FOR SOME FOOD?

14:18.357 --> 14:20.943
(<i> panting...</i> )

14:21.026 --> 14:23.195
{\an1}READ TO HIT
THE SURF, TWIST?

14:23.279 --> 14:24.405
I NEED SOME
GRINDAGE FIRST.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.615
WHAT ABOUT YOU, SQUID?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.617
I HAVE TO WAIT 30 MINUTES.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.203
{\an1}WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU LAME-O's?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.288
I'M HITTING THE WATER.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.289
ME, TOO.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.707
WHEN THE SURF'S UP

14:34.790 --> 14:36.625
ALL I SEE IS TASTY WAVES.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.793
LET'S GO!

14:37.876 --> 14:38.961
{\an1}ALL RIGHT!
(<i> laughs</i> )

14:46.719 --> 14:47.303
{\an1}Otto:
I WIN!

14:47.386 --> 14:49.847
I GET FIRST RIDE.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.515
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT.

14:51.599 --> 14:55.144
{\an1}HEY, HOW ABOUT LETTING YOUR DEAR
OLD DAD GET THE FIRST WAVE?

14:55.227 --> 14:56.437
(<i> growling</i> )

14:56.520 --> 14:58.522
(<i> laughing</i> )

14:58.606 --> 15:00.316
HERE COMES A WAVE.

15:00.399 --> 15:00.983
LET'S BE ON IT.

15:01.066 --> 15:05.738
{\an1}MY WAVE!
PROPERTY OF OTTO ROCKET.

15:11.368 --> 15:12.494
(<i> growls</i> )

15:12.578 --> 15:15.831
MONGO DON'T LIKE SHOOBIES.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.630
(<i> munching and slurping</i> )

15:22.713 --> 15:24.923
THAT CHICKEN WAS PRIMO, TITO.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.010
MMM, WE AIM TO PLEASE,
LITTLE CUZ.

15:28.093 --> 15:28.969
{\an1}MMM...

15:30.179 --> 15:31.680
(<i> flies buzzing</i> )

15:31.764 --> 15:34.350
OH, I GOT TO MAKE ONE BASKET.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.018
WHOO-HOO! YEAH!

15:36.101 --> 15:37.603
{\an1}OH, YEAH!

15:37.686 --> 15:39.063
WHOO-HOO!

15:41.065 --> 15:42.399
YEAH!

15:46.445 --> 15:48.697
Reggie:
UH, DAD...

15:48.781 --> 15:52.201
WHY IS EVERYBODY
GIVING US THE STINK EYE?

15:55.454 --> 15:57.122
THEY'RE JUST
CHECKING OUT RAYMUNDO.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.250
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY THEY GET
TO SURF WITH A LIVING LEGEND.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.335
RIGHT, DAD?

16:01.418 --> 16:02.961
THAT MUST BE IT.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.296
MAYBE I SHOULD GIVE
THESE GUYS A THRILL.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.297
WATCH THIS.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.257
HEY, BRO!

16:07.341 --> 16:08.842
CLASSY WAVES, HUH?

16:09.968 --> 16:14.682
{\an5}YOU DON'T LIVE HERE,
YOU DON'T SURF HERE.
GOT ME?

16:14.765 --> 16:16.892
YEAH, LOCALS ONLY.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.727
GO HOME, SHOOBIES.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.729
SHOOBIES? NOT HERE.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.232
NOT AT OUR SECRET SPOT.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.525
I THINK HE'S TALKING TO US,
ROCKET BOY.

16:24.608 --> 16:28.237
YOU AND DAD ARE SHOOBIES?

16:28.320 --> 16:31.031
(<i> munching and slurping</i> )

16:34.326 --> 16:36.995
MMM...
(<i> slurping</i> )

16:38.539 --> 16:40.708
HMM, ARE THOSE BROTHERS
GIVING US THE STINK EYE?

16:40.791 --> 16:42.459
IS THERE SOMETHING IN MY TEETH?

16:42.543 --> 16:43.919
HEY, SQUID...

16:44.002 --> 16:46.380
ASK THEM IF THEY HAVE
ANY MOIST TOWELETTES.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.257
WE'RE OUT.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.267
(<i> panting</i> )

16:58.350 --> 17:00.102
I DON'T GET IT.

17:00.185 --> 17:04.272
{\an5}MAYBE THESE DAYS
DROPPING IN ON A LEGEND
IS A SIGN OF ADMIRATION.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.607
ALOHA, BROS!

17:07.734 --> 17:10.112
THE LOCALS ARE SO HARSH.

17:10.194 --> 17:13.031
THEY'RE NOT LETTING US
CATCH ANY WAVES, DAD.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.909
{\an1}MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST GO BACK
AND SURF IN OCEAN SHORES.

17:15.992 --> 17:19.163
COME ON, GUYS, YOU CAN'T
GIVE UP THAT EASY.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.458
{\an5}YOU JUST NEED TO EARN
THEIR RESPECT, LIKE...
(<i> grunts</i> )

17:23.375 --> 17:24.501
...I HAVE.

17:24.585 --> 17:29.214
THEY'LL RESPECT ME AFTER THEY
SEE ME BUST SOME MAJOR AIR.

17:33.218 --> 17:37.473
WHOA! YEAH! WHOA!

17:37.556 --> 17:38.849
(<i> both yelling</i> )

17:44.188 --> 17:46.023
(<i> growling</i> )

17:46.106 --> 17:48.692
YOU CUT MONGO OFF, SHOOBIE.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.611
I AM NOT A SHOOBIE.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.197
THIS IS OUR SECRET SPOT.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.324
THE OCEAN DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.536
MONGO REGRET TO INFORM YOU

17:59.620 --> 18:00.871
<i>IT'S MY SPOT!</i>

18:00.954 --> 18:03.415
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHO MY DAD IS?

18:03.499 --> 18:05.292
{\an1}HMM?

18:05.375 --> 18:08.337
RAY ROCKET OF THE OCEAN SHORES
ROCKETS.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.797
{\an3}HUH?

18:09.880 --> 18:12.800
DUH... RIPPING RAYMUNDO.

18:12.883 --> 18:17.471
{\an5}HELLO, EVER HEAR
OF THE CLASSIC 1970s
SURF MOVIE <i> EASY NOSE RIDER?</i>

18:17.554 --> 18:22.476
{\an1}LOOK, RIPPING RAYMUNDO,
THIS MONGO'S SPOT!

18:22.559 --> 18:25.187
{\an1}IF YOU DON'T LIVE HERE,
YOU DON'T SURF HERE.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.105
{\an1}GET IT?

18:26.188 --> 18:26.605
{\an1}YEAH, MAN.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.525
{\an1}Man:
YEAH, SHOOBIE.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.692
LET'S GO, KIDS.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.985
FOLLOW ME.

18:37.157 --> 18:37.449
MMM...

18:37.533 --> 18:39.493
CATCH THIS!

18:39.576 --> 18:39.910
WHOA!

18:39.993 --> 18:42.412
HEY, WATCH OUT!

18:43.539 --> 18:44.790
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:45.749 --> 18:47.751
HEY, HEY...

18:47.835 --> 18:49.711
I GOT IT, I GOT IT, I GOT IT!

18:49.795 --> 18:54.383
{\an5}UH, HEY, LITTLE CUZZES,
LET'S MOVE TO A DIFFERENT SPOT
ON THE BEACH.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.926
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS SPOT?

18:56.009 --> 19:00.222
WE GOT THE SUN, WE GOT THE SURF,
WE GOT CHICKEN WINGS, WE GOT...

19:00.305 --> 19:03.016
SAND IN THE POTATO SALAD!

19:04.184 --> 19:07.479
GO HOME AND TRASH
YOUR OWN BEACH, KOOKS.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.190
THEY GOT SAND
IN THE POTATO SALAD!

19:11.900 --> 19:15.237
{\an1}I SEE YOU GUYS ARE
MAKING FRIENDS, TOO.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.990
THEY GOT SAND
IN THE POTATO SALAD!

19:18.073 --> 19:21.243
{\an1}MAN, TITO, I'VE NEVER BEEN
VIBED LIKE THIS BEFORE.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.495
WE'RE OBVIOUSLY
NOT WELCOME HERE.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.998
THIS SPOT HAS CHANGED
FOR THE WORSE, BROTHER.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.500
REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE
IN THE OLD DAYS?

19:28.584 --> 19:33.005
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY, BRO,
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

19:33.088 --> 19:37.050
{\an5}Tito:
<i>THIS SPOT USED TO BE ALL ABOUT</i>
<i>FUN IN THE SUN, LITTLE COUSINS.</i>

19:37.134 --> 19:40.345
{\an5}Ray:
<i>AND EVERYBODY WAS</i>
<i>SO COOL TO EACH OTHER.</i>

19:40.429 --> 19:41.638
NO, NO, NO, YOU GO.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.015
OH, NO, NO, YOU GO.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.391
NAH, YOU GO.

19:44.474 --> 19:45.517
AFTER YOU, BROTHER.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.019
NO, AFTER YOU.

19:47.102 --> 19:47.644
MAHALO, YOU GO, OKAY?

19:47.728 --> 19:49.521
NO, GO AHEAD.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.731
NO, NO, NO, YOU GO.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.190
OH, PLEASE, I INSIST.

19:52.274 --> 19:56.612
WE WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE
THE WAVES AND THE BEACH

19:56.695 --> 20:00.073
{\an5}AS LONG AS IT WAS DONE
IN A POLITE, MATURE
AND RESPECTFUL FASHION.

20:00.157 --> 20:04.036
WELL, THIS ISN'T
EXACTLY RESPECTFUL, GUYS.

20:04.119 --> 20:07.039
{\an1}YEAH, WE CAME HERE TO SURF,
NOT TRASH THE PLACE.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.375
GUESS WE MADE A LITTLE MESS.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.420
AND WE DIDN'T REALLY RESPECT
THE GUYS IN THE LINEUP, DAD.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.714
WELL, THEY GOT SAND
IN THE POTATO SALAD.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.717
LOOKS LIKE WE ALL FORGOT

20:18.800 --> 20:21.386
ABOUT THE ANCIENT
HAWAIIAN GOLDEN RULE:

20:21.470 --> 20:24.014
DON'T DO ANYTHING
TO YOUR BROTHER...

20:24.097 --> 20:27.017
THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT
YOUR BROTHER TO DO TO YOU?

20:27.100 --> 20:28.477
HEY, I REMEMBERED IT!

20:28.560 --> 20:29.603
AH...

20:30.896 --> 20:31.939
THAT ONE GUY SAID

20:32.022 --> 20:34.066
WE SHOULD TRASH OUR OWN BEACH.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.318
LET'S GO HOME.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.153
SOMETIMES
YOU MAKE ME WONDER.

20:38.236 --> 20:40.030
I THINK WE'VE ACTED
LIKE SHOOBIES ENOUGH.

20:40.113 --> 20:43.325
MAYBE SOMEONE SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.161
OR MAYBE WE SHOULD SHOW THEM
SOME RESPECT.

20:46.244 --> 20:47.454
ATTAGIRL.

20:50.707 --> 20:54.169
{\an1}WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
FOR ALMOST AN HOUR.

20:54.252 --> 20:55.545
MY SENSITIVE SKIN

20:55.629 --> 20:56.880
IS PRUNING.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.799
{\an1}ARE WE EVER GOING TO
GET TO SURF?

20:58.882 --> 21:00.676
NOT TILL WE EARN
OUR OWN WAVES.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.803
DAD, HERE COMES MONGO.

21:02.886 --> 21:06.682
GO AHEAD, GUYS, YOU UP.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.184
WHAT? WHY ARE YOU LETTING US GO?

21:09.267 --> 21:10.143
BECAUSE YOU CLEANED UP THE BEACH

21:10.227 --> 21:13.480
YOU WAITED YOUR TURN
OUT HERE IN THE LINEUP

21:13.563 --> 21:15.649
AND YOU RESPECTED US.

21:15.732 --> 21:19.528
{\an5}BUT MOST IMPORTANT,
MONGO DON'T LIKE LITTLE BROS
THAT ARE ALL PRUNED UP.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.154
(<i> laughs</i> )

21:22.864 --> 21:26.118
WHOA... WHOA!

21:26.201 --> 21:28.912

21:45.095 --> 21:48.557
(<i> all yelling and whooping</i> )

21:56.440 --> 21:59.234
(<i> laughing</i> )

21:59.317 --> 22:04.448
{\an5}PSST... I'VE SEEN
<i>EASY NOSE RIDER,</i>
LIKE, 67 TIMES, BRO.

22:04.531 --> 22:04.740
YOU DON'T SAY.
