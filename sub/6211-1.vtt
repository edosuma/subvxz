WEBVTT

00:02.468 --> 00:04.235
This is Sabrina's
18th birthday party

00:04.303 --> 00:06.238
and I want everything
to be perfect.

00:06.305 --> 00:08.806
18? I can't
believe it.

00:08.874 --> 00:10.675
She'll be leaving
home soon.

00:10.709 --> 00:12.510
Starting a whole new life.

00:12.577 --> 00:13.912
Making new friends...

00:13.979 --> 00:15.914
A new place to live.

00:15.981 --> 00:18.449
We probably won't
see her much anymore.

00:18.517 --> 00:21.686
She'll be too busy
to visit her silly old aunts.

00:21.754 --> 00:22.820
I'm home!

00:22.888 --> 00:24.756
Yeah, but not for long.

00:24.823 --> 00:25.890
Aah...

00:25.958 --> 00:28.260
We can't let her
see us all teary.

00:28.327 --> 00:30.061
Happy faces.

00:30.163 --> 00:33.197
Not the
smiling spell.

00:33.265 --> 00:34.866
This is going to be
the best year ever.

00:34.934 --> 00:36.535
I just heard
that Libby's parents

00:36.602 --> 00:38.169
are sending her
to boarding school.

00:38.237 --> 00:40.071
I guess Children of the Corn
Academy has reopened.

00:40.106 --> 00:42.307
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to chocolate town.

00:42.374 --> 00:45.010
See? She's leaving
us already.

00:45.077 --> 00:48.379
Our little witch
is all grown up.

00:48.447 --> 00:49.480
You still have little me.

00:49.548 --> 00:51.415
(both crying)

01:20.446 --> 01:22.947
(thunder crashing)

01:28.354 --> 01:30.021
and Valerie's bedthink
up against that wall?

01:30.089 --> 01:32.390
How about we put Valerie's bed
where it belongs--

01:32.457 --> 01:34.658
with her family in Alaska?

01:34.726 --> 01:36.127
Salem, I'm sorry,
but I asked you

01:36.195 --> 01:38.063
if it was okay if
Valerie comes to stay.

01:38.130 --> 01:41.399
But I thought you said,
"I'd like to get you a valet."

01:41.467 --> 01:42.667
Valerie's my best friend.

01:42.735 --> 01:44.368
I can't let her finish up
high school in Anchorage.

01:44.436 --> 01:46.238
She looks terrible
in mukluks.

01:46.305 --> 01:48.439
And remember, while
she's here, no talking.

01:48.507 --> 01:50.241
Something
in your eye

01:50.309 --> 01:52.410
or an aneurysm-- either
way, take it outside.

01:52.478 --> 01:54.512
I'm trying some
nonverbal communication.

01:54.580 --> 01:57.448
That was Morse code for,
"I can't believe those aunts

01:57.516 --> 01:59.784
agreed to let Valerie
come live with us."

01:59.852 --> 02:02.853
Yeah. Every so often
they're shockingly cool.

02:02.921 --> 02:05.823
I can't believe you agreed to
let Valerie come live with us.

02:05.891 --> 02:08.960
Me? I believe you're the one
who said, "Gee, it'd be nice

02:09.027 --> 02:11.529
to have a mortal
around the house for a change."

02:11.596 --> 02:14.165
First of all, I never say "Gee."

02:14.232 --> 02:15.733
The point is, we agreed.

02:15.835 --> 02:18.502
Now we're just going to have
to learn to get along

02:18.570 --> 02:21.105
without magic around the house
for nine months.

02:21.173 --> 02:23.341
It's Sabrina's last year
at home and...

02:23.409 --> 02:26.778
I want everything to be...
(sniffles) perfect.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.012
You're right.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.247
In nine months, we can do
all the magic that we want.

02:30.315 --> 02:33.083
There won't be any
teenagers around

02:33.151 --> 02:36.887
(sniffling):
to tell us how uncool
and out-of-style we are.

02:36.955 --> 02:39.724
I can always do that for you.

02:39.791 --> 02:41.625
Thanks, Zellie.

02:44.029 --> 02:46.297
Don't forget the
one from your dad.

02:46.365 --> 02:48.266
Okay, it's not a car, so I'm
going with my second choice.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.535
It must be tickets
to the Britney Spears concert.

02:51.537 --> 02:53.204
Surprise!

02:53.272 --> 02:54.171
Dad!

02:54.239 --> 02:55.606
If the rest of you
is in a Porsche,

02:55.674 --> 02:58.777
I'm the happiest girl
in the world.

02:58.844 --> 03:00.678
I guess that explains
the air holes.

03:00.746 --> 03:01.947
Sabrina... ah.

03:02.014 --> 03:04.982
I'm afraid my present is
a little bit selfish this year.

03:05.050 --> 03:06.116
Men's shoes again?

03:06.184 --> 03:07.385
No. I'm semi-retiring

03:07.453 --> 03:09.654
from the Other Realm
Foreign Service,

03:09.721 --> 03:11.088
so I'm going to
be settling down.

03:11.156 --> 03:13.257
I want you to come to
Paris and live with me.

03:13.325 --> 03:14.191
Live with you?

03:14.259 --> 03:14.792
Right now?

03:14.860 --> 03:16.528
Well, of course not.

03:16.595 --> 03:18.663
She needs time to pack.

03:20.632 --> 03:21.665
Dad, I don't know
what to say.

03:21.733 --> 03:22.801
I know--
how about

03:22.868 --> 03:23.834
"Thanks, but no, thanks."

03:23.902 --> 03:25.870
Would you excuse us?

03:25.938 --> 03:27.605
We have to check
on those cakes.

03:27.673 --> 03:28.773
Mmm... huh?

03:28.841 --> 03:30.141
We can't let
him do this!

03:30.208 --> 03:33.077
He can't just pop in here
and take our Sabrina away.

03:33.144 --> 03:34.245
He's her father.

03:34.313 --> 03:35.547
Of course he can.

03:35.614 --> 03:37.749
We knew this day would come.

03:37.816 --> 03:40.318
Yes, but not for
a long, long time.

03:40.385 --> 03:42.120
Oh, it's not fair.

03:42.188 --> 03:45.589
And there are paw prints
all over my cake!

03:45.657 --> 03:47.826
When I'm upset, I eat.

03:47.893 --> 03:49.894
Now, listen,
you've got to promise me

03:49.961 --> 03:52.964
that you're not going to try
to influence Sabrina's decision.

03:53.032 --> 03:56.301
If she wants to leave us,
(sniffles)... well...

03:56.368 --> 03:58.469
SABRINA:
Dad, I'll be right back.

04:00.138 --> 04:01.406
Isn't this fantastic?

04:01.473 --> 04:03.908
Dad said he and Gail live
in the magic quarter in Paris

04:03.975 --> 04:06.243
and their apartment is actually
<i>in</i> the Eiffel tower.

04:06.311 --> 04:08.145
Think about how many thousands
of Japanese snapshots

04:08.213 --> 04:09.380
I'll be in!

04:09.448 --> 04:10.782
(sniffling)

04:10.849 --> 04:12.050
Are you crying?

04:12.117 --> 04:13.084
Onions.

04:13.151 --> 04:14.819
New cake recipe.

04:14.820 --> 04:17.922
Sometimes I just don't
understand Martha Stewart.

04:17.990 --> 04:18.523
(knocking)

04:18.589 --> 04:20.325
Happy birthday.

04:22.828 --> 04:24.695
Wow! This must be
a fantastic party.

04:24.830 --> 04:27.765
You two look like you're
having a really good time.

04:31.303 --> 04:33.872
Whoo-hoo, tickets to the
Britney Spears concert!

04:33.939 --> 04:35.874
Actually they're
parking lot passes.

04:35.941 --> 04:38.376
We have to listen
to the concert from outside,

04:38.444 --> 04:41.112
but we might get to see her
when she runs to her limo.

04:41.179 --> 04:42.614
Whoo-hoo, parking
lot passes

04:42.682 --> 04:44.683
to the Britney
Spears concert!

04:44.750 --> 04:46.017
You know, Sabrina,

04:46.084 --> 04:48.920
I think this is going
to be the best year ever.

04:54.893 --> 04:57.294
And so, I just don't think
I can go right now.

04:57.362 --> 04:59.697
I mean, there's Harvey,
and senior year starts tomorrow,

04:59.765 --> 05:01.265
and I have a friend
moving in with me,

05:01.333 --> 05:03.200
and I hear the French
can be really rude.

05:03.268 --> 05:04.969
Sabrina, it's okay.

05:05.037 --> 05:06.503
I understand.

05:06.571 --> 05:07.939
Just promise me
you'll think about it.

05:08.007 --> 05:10.741
I miss having you close by.

05:10.809 --> 05:12.142
SABRINA:
I promise.

05:13.979 --> 05:16.581
Checking each other
for chiggers.

05:21.286 --> 05:23.321
Please tell me this means
what I think it means.

05:23.388 --> 05:24.289
That my mother was right,

05:24.356 --> 05:25.990
and I should have
taken those classes

05:26.092 --> 05:27.425
to become
a court reporter?

05:27.493 --> 05:29.127
No. That Mr. Kraft
is not coming back

05:29.194 --> 05:31.229
thus proving
that prayers are answered.

05:31.296 --> 05:32.564
They told me to take
his name off the door.

05:32.631 --> 05:34.632
New vice principal
starts today.

05:34.700 --> 05:35.666
No Libby, no Kraft.

05:35.734 --> 05:37.869
So, this is what
it's like to peak.

05:37.936 --> 05:39.570
Hey, guess what?

05:39.638 --> 05:41.372
Well, if my day keeps going
the way it's been going,

05:41.439 --> 05:42.974
you've got gold for me?

05:43.041 --> 05:44.209
No, but I have news.

05:44.276 --> 05:45.576
You remember Brad?

05:45.644 --> 05:47.378
Your best friend
who moved back to Texas?

05:47.446 --> 05:49.880
The guy who used to burn ants
with a magnifying glass?

05:49.948 --> 05:51.282
That's the guy,
and he's back.

05:51.350 --> 05:54.719
Come on. I can't wait
for you to meet him.

05:54.786 --> 05:57.421
Oh! Glad to see you learned
to catch while I was gone.

05:57.489 --> 05:58.456
Hi, Brad.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.225
Oh, hey,
right back at you, Courtney.

06:00.292 --> 06:02.327
Hey, Brad, I'd like
you to meet Sabrina.

06:02.394 --> 06:03.728
Sabrina?
Oh, it's about ti...

06:03.796 --> 06:04.362
Hi.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.863
Hi.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.165
Hey, Joey!

06:07.232 --> 06:08.966
Nice to meet
you, too.

06:09.034 --> 06:10.435
Isn't he great?

06:10.502 --> 06:14.572
Yeah. Good thing
I don't have a thorax.

06:14.639 --> 06:16.674
Why can't we just
put all this stuff
in the basement

06:16.742 --> 06:17.875
with the rest
of the junk?

06:17.943 --> 06:19.844
Well, because we have
to pack up all our potions

06:19.911 --> 06:21.145
before Valerie arrives

06:21.212 --> 06:23.448
so I thought we might
as well go through them.

06:23.515 --> 06:26.884
For example, this frog's tongue
expired in 1872.

06:26.952 --> 06:28.052
SALEM:
Help!

06:28.120 --> 06:29.954
Fire!

06:30.022 --> 06:31.388
Help! Help!

06:31.456 --> 06:33.158
Salem!
That's a real toaster.

06:33.258 --> 06:35.627
I packed up the magic one
this morning.

06:35.694 --> 06:37.028
It's only for toast.

06:37.095 --> 06:39.163
Well, that's stupid.

06:43.369 --> 06:47.004
You ordered a king-size cat bed
with magic fingers?

06:47.072 --> 06:49.206
And where do you expect
to put that, Hef?

06:49.274 --> 06:50.674
Sabrina's room.

06:50.742 --> 06:53.944
It's custom, so you have
to order it months in advance.

06:54.012 --> 06:55.246
In advance of what?

06:55.313 --> 06:57.048
Sabrina going away to college.

06:57.115 --> 06:58.316
While you sob sisters

06:58.383 --> 06:59.783
have been sniveling
at the thought of it,

06:59.851 --> 07:01.452
I've been planning ahead.

07:01.553 --> 07:04.488
Nine months
and Salem's getting his own pad.

07:04.556 --> 07:06.024
Yeah, baby!

07:06.091 --> 07:08.059
Good luck
opening the door.

07:08.126 --> 07:09.427
Guh?

07:09.494 --> 07:11.261
Hey. So you excited
to be back in Westbridge?

07:11.329 --> 07:13.431
Must be great to know
everyone missed you...

07:13.498 --> 07:14.632
Yeah, so whatever.

07:14.733 --> 07:16.401
Okay, if he calls me a freak

07:16.468 --> 07:19.470
I know Libby got hold
of some male hormones.

07:19.471 --> 07:21.539
Hey, there's Brad.

07:21.606 --> 07:22.906
He saved
us a seat.

07:22.974 --> 07:24.142
I think
he saved <i>you</i> a seat.

07:24.209 --> 07:26.043
Harvey, I really
don't think he likes me.

07:26.111 --> 07:27.511
What are you talking about?

07:27.579 --> 07:28.713
Of course he likes you.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.248
Hey, could we make
some room for Sabrina?

07:31.316 --> 07:32.750
Yeah, sure.

07:32.818 --> 07:34.185
See?

07:34.252 --> 07:35.085
I was just getting up.

07:35.153 --> 07:36.921
See?

07:36.988 --> 07:38.156
Hey, Brad...

07:38.223 --> 07:41.225
Do you have some kind
of problem with Sabrina?

07:41.292 --> 07:42.493
Sabrina?

07:42.561 --> 07:44.328
She's cool. Why?

07:44.396 --> 07:45.663
No reason.

07:45.731 --> 07:46.931
Forget about it.

07:48.433 --> 07:52.203
He thinks you're great.

07:52.270 --> 07:54.872
ZELDA:
<i>All we've been doing is sitting</i>
<i>around the house, crying.</i>

07:54.940 --> 07:57.008
Why don't we go out
somewhere fun and
cheer ourselves up?

07:57.076 --> 07:58.209
That's a great idea.

07:58.277 --> 07:59.977
Hey, you know,
that revival house downtown

08:00.044 --> 08:01.912
is playing a fabulous
double feature--

08:01.980 --> 08:03.947
<i>Terms of Endearment</i>
and <i>Sophie's Choice.</i>

08:04.015 --> 08:07.085
Perfect. I could
use a good cry.

08:07.152 --> 08:08.486
BRAD:
Kinkle, think fast!

08:08.554 --> 08:10.821
Don't forget--
my place, 7:30.

08:10.889 --> 08:12.123
We'll be there.

08:12.191 --> 08:13.223
What's going on at 7:30?

08:13.291 --> 08:14.725
I thought we had a date.

08:14.793 --> 08:17.361
The guys are having this
"welcome back" thing for Brad,

08:17.429 --> 08:20.031
and I figured we could
combine it with our date.

08:20.099 --> 08:21.633
Shoot, and I was hoping
we could go out

08:21.700 --> 08:23.534
for Chinese water torture.

08:23.602 --> 08:25.403
What's this problem
you have with Brad?

08:25.470 --> 08:26.971
The only problem
I have with Brad

08:27.039 --> 08:28.906
is that Brad has
a problem with me.

08:28.974 --> 08:30.207
I can kind of see why.

08:30.275 --> 08:31.642
You're not being
very welcoming.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.245
Oh, yeah, that whole friendly
thing I do is so off-putting.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.047
Fine. We won't go to Brad's
house and have fun;

08:36.115 --> 08:37.381
we'll go out.

08:37.448 --> 08:39.515
Maybe I don't
want to go out.

08:39.583 --> 08:41.184
Great, 'cause I don't think
I want to take you out.

08:41.253 --> 08:42.453
Great.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.087
Not great.

08:44.155 --> 08:45.289
Hey!

08:45.357 --> 08:46.123
Mr. Kraft?

08:46.191 --> 08:47.625
What are you doing here?

08:47.693 --> 08:49.827
You're not vice principal
anymore.

08:49.895 --> 08:50.694
True.

08:50.762 --> 08:52.696
Ineffectual,
purely a figurehead

08:52.764 --> 08:54.865
Vice Principal Kraft
is no more.

08:54.933 --> 08:58.802
Now it is all-seeing,
all-powerful Principal Kraft.

08:58.870 --> 08:59.837
Principal?!

08:59.905 --> 09:01.371
What am I-- Job?

09:01.439 --> 09:02.873
(chuckling)

09:02.941 --> 09:05.543
This is going to be
the best year ever.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.212
Hello?

09:08.280 --> 09:09.747
Crisis!

09:09.815 --> 09:11.348
Aunt Hilda?

09:11.416 --> 09:13.084
Aunt Zelda?

09:13.152 --> 09:14.752
Where is everybody?

09:14.820 --> 09:17.155
Oh, they're having fun
at the movies and dinner

09:17.222 --> 09:19.090
as opposed to being here
where they should be

09:19.158 --> 09:21.659
while I'm having
a Force-five freak-out!

09:21.727 --> 09:24.294
Salem, I'm in full crisis mode!

09:24.362 --> 09:25.830
Yuh-huh.

09:25.897 --> 09:26.931
Do you think

09:26.999 --> 09:28.332
a mirrored ceiling
would be too much

09:28.399 --> 09:29.967
or just enough?

09:30.035 --> 09:31.269
Salem!

09:31.336 --> 09:33.837
(phone rings)

09:33.905 --> 09:35.305
If this is someone trying
to switch my long-distance,

09:35.373 --> 09:37.842
I swear... Valerie?

09:37.909 --> 09:39.943
Oh, thank goodness,
someone to talk to!

09:40.011 --> 09:41.512
Listen, Mr. Kraft

09:41.580 --> 09:42.546
is principal.

09:42.614 --> 09:43.881
Harvey has
this obnoxious friend,

09:43.949 --> 09:45.616
and we had a huge fight...

09:45.683 --> 09:48.619
Wait. Aren't you supposed
to be on a plane?

09:48.687 --> 09:50.955
What?!

09:51.023 --> 09:53.624
No. Of course I understand.

09:53.691 --> 09:54.792
Sure.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.060
Okay. Bye.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.394
Valerie's not coming.

09:57.462 --> 09:59.630
She can't leave her family.

09:59.697 --> 10:02.499
Yes! Look who's talking now!

10:02.567 --> 10:05.936
This is going to be
the worst year of my life!

10:06.004 --> 10:08.005
Unless...

10:08.073 --> 10:09.339
Sabrina, where are you going?

10:11.109 --> 10:12.476
Paris.

10:17.215 --> 10:22.586
Dear Harvey, the view
from my dad's apartment is...

10:22.654 --> 10:25.756
Uh, my dad's apartment
is located in the Eiffel...

10:28.927 --> 10:30.962
The cheese is great.

10:34.332 --> 10:36.967
Ah! Bonjour, Cherie.

10:37.035 --> 10:38.202
Bonjour!

10:38.270 --> 10:39.537
Hey, Melvin,
you want me

10:39.604 --> 10:40.938
to get you some food?

10:41.006 --> 10:42.472
GAIL:
That's your
stepbrother's job.

10:42.540 --> 10:43.975
Donald!

10:45.677 --> 10:46.644
(scoffing)

10:46.712 --> 10:48.145
Thank you!

10:48.212 --> 10:49.947
Silly me. I was going
to do it the mortal way,

10:50.015 --> 10:51.549
but then, I'm so bourgeois.

10:51.616 --> 10:52.783
Okay, we better get going

10:52.851 --> 10:55.386
if we want to beat the crowds
at Euro Disney again.

10:55.454 --> 10:56.921
I'll get Donald.

10:56.988 --> 10:58.388
Oh, actually,
I was kind of hoping

10:58.456 --> 10:59.924
I'd be starting school today.

10:59.991 --> 11:03.428
Oh, honey, I'm sorry-- I keep
forgetting to look into that.

11:03.495 --> 11:06.096
Look, why don't I just
zap you in a tutor?

11:06.164 --> 11:07.297
You like Einstein?

11:07.365 --> 11:09.533
Thanks, but... you know,
even if kids here

11:09.601 --> 11:11.869
do considering bathing
a quirky personality trait,

11:11.936 --> 11:13.838
I really think I'd rather be
going to a regular high school

11:13.906 --> 11:15.306
with kids my own age.

11:15.374 --> 11:18.209
You are definitely your
mortal mother's daughter.

11:18.276 --> 11:19.610
All right, let's go.

11:19.677 --> 11:22.146
Uh, actually, I think I'm
going to hang out here today.

11:22.213 --> 11:23.547
I'm feeling
a little homesick.

11:23.615 --> 11:25.783
Or maybe it's the cream sauce
from breakfast.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.751
Well, you can always
check up on people

11:27.820 --> 11:29.120
on the mortal channel.

11:29.187 --> 11:31.288
I mean, I paid for
the premium package.

11:31.356 --> 11:33.590
Somebody might
as well use it.

11:35.894 --> 11:37.127
Yeah, watching people

11:37.195 --> 11:38.862
who probably don't care less
that I'm gone--

11:38.930 --> 11:40.164
that'll cheer me up.

11:40.232 --> 11:41.833
We'll have a good day
together, won't we?

11:41.900 --> 11:44.435
Just you and me--
right, Melvin?

11:44.502 --> 11:46.604
(snoring)
Melvin?

11:46.671 --> 11:47.871
Yo, Kinkle!
Think fast!

11:47.939 --> 11:49.606
Hey, you know
you've been

11:49.674 --> 11:51.675
wearing that shirt
for three days?

11:51.710 --> 11:52.943
Four.

11:53.011 --> 11:56.680
This is what I was wearing
the last time I saw Sabrina.

11:56.748 --> 11:58.415
Yeah, get it all
in there.

11:58.483 --> 12:02.052
What are you doing
to Sabrina's locker?!

12:02.120 --> 12:04.955
Erasing every last memory
and molecule of Miss Spellman.

12:08.093 --> 12:09.927
I don't know if I want
to check up on Harvey.

12:09.995 --> 12:12.096
I mean, we had
that stupid fight

12:12.164 --> 12:13.397
and he probably
doesn't even miss me.

12:13.464 --> 12:15.198
All right, quit badgering me--
I'll look.

12:15.266 --> 12:17.568
(laughing)

12:17.636 --> 12:20.904
Oh. Well, he certainly seems to
be keeping his anguish in check.

12:20.972 --> 12:24.575
Yeah, apparently,
the healing has begun.

12:24.643 --> 12:25.642
(laughing)

12:25.710 --> 12:27.611
He is <i>so</i> over me.

12:29.514 --> 12:31.314
(laughing)

12:33.384 --> 12:35.152
Okay, thank you, Mr. Kinkle,

12:35.219 --> 12:36.320
for helping me demonstrate

12:36.387 --> 12:38.088
how stimulating
the nervous system

12:38.156 --> 12:40.824
can provoke
an involuntary response--

12:40.892 --> 12:42.760
in this case, laughter.

12:42.827 --> 12:45.796
Sabrina's ticklish
behind the ears.

12:45.863 --> 12:49.299
And may I recommend
a strong antifungal?

12:49.367 --> 12:52.436
Oh, I hate
substituting.

12:52.504 --> 12:53.604
(sobbing)

12:53.672 --> 12:56.040
Hilda, please, pull
yourself together.

12:56.141 --> 12:57.375
You've got to
stop crying.

12:57.442 --> 12:58.876
Why?

12:58.944 --> 13:01.512
Because whenever
I see you doing it

13:01.579 --> 13:04.315
(sobbing):
I start.

13:04.382 --> 13:05.783
Oh, sure. Blame me.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.452
Yeah, it's all
Hilda's fault.

13:08.519 --> 13:12.189
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to take it out on you.

13:12.257 --> 13:13.791
You're all I have.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.027
Think how I feel.

13:16.094 --> 13:18.929
You're all <i>I</i> have.

13:22.467 --> 13:23.901
Here.

13:24.036 --> 13:26.203
Help with these boxes.

13:26.271 --> 13:28.406
It's good to keep busy.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.942
And be careful, there
are potions in there.

13:31.009 --> 13:32.643
I know. You don't always
have to...

13:32.711 --> 13:33.911
(gasps)

13:37.982 --> 13:40.384
Want to wreak havoc
in Gotham City?

13:40.452 --> 13:42.152
Well, Harvey might not care
that I'm gone,

13:42.220 --> 13:43.520
but I'm sure my aunts miss me.

13:47.626 --> 13:50.160
(laughing)

13:50.228 --> 13:53.130
Uncontrollable laughter must be
one of the stages of grief.

13:53.197 --> 13:54.965
You looked ridiculous.

13:55.033 --> 13:56.834
Oh, me?
You should have seen <i>you.</i>

13:56.901 --> 13:58.936
(clucking)

13:59.004 --> 14:02.873
They're so happy I'm gone,
they're giddy!

14:02.940 --> 14:05.643
Wait, wait-- do you
hear something?

14:05.710 --> 14:07.043
I hear crying.

14:07.111 --> 14:08.212
Salem?

14:08.280 --> 14:10.814
Finally, someone misses me.

14:10.882 --> 14:13.651
Granted, I would have bet big
money it wouldn't be the cat.

14:13.718 --> 14:16.620
(sobbing)

14:16.688 --> 14:18.856
Salem, are you all right?

14:18.924 --> 14:22.460
Oh... tell Zelda
what's the matter.

14:22.527 --> 14:25.162
It's... it's...

14:25.297 --> 14:28.532
it's the drapes.

14:28.599 --> 14:29.933
They clash with
the new comforter,

14:30.001 --> 14:32.703
and I can't return them.

14:32.770 --> 14:34.305
(sobbing)

14:34.372 --> 14:36.907
My bed's not even cold
and he's moving in already.

14:36.975 --> 14:39.409
You know, it seems like the only
person who's excited to see me

14:39.477 --> 14:41.078
is my dad.

14:41.145 --> 14:43.047
I've got to do everything
possible to try to fit in here.

14:43.114 --> 14:44.482
What do you think?

14:46.117 --> 14:48.385
You're dead, aren't you, Melvin?

14:48.452 --> 14:50.454
You self-absorbed cat.

14:50.521 --> 14:52.556
I know that's redundant.

14:52.623 --> 14:53.658
Okay, truth time.

14:53.725 --> 14:56.093
I don't care about curtains.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.696
I'm upset because
I miss Sabrina.

14:58.763 --> 15:01.698
Everything in here
reminds me of her.

15:01.766 --> 15:03.467
Because it <i>is</i> hers!

15:03.535 --> 15:06.470
I miss my Sabrini.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.338
(sobbing)

15:08.406 --> 15:11.041
"Sabrini"?

15:11.109 --> 15:12.209
...and so I've been
rethinking

15:12.277 --> 15:13.844
this whole
mortal high school thing:

15:13.911 --> 15:15.379
learning English
as a second language,

15:15.414 --> 15:17.014
downing goose liver
and snail sandwiches--

15:17.082 --> 15:18.248
no, thank you.

15:18.316 --> 15:20.684
Sabrina, this doesn't
sound like you.

15:20.751 --> 15:22.887
Oh, really? Don't you
recognize my voice?

15:22.954 --> 15:24.288
Are you unhappy here?

15:24.356 --> 15:25.322
No, not at all.

15:25.390 --> 15:27.558
It's just... well,
I was supposed to go

15:27.625 --> 15:29.926
to this Britney Spears
concert, and...

15:29.994 --> 15:31.161
Say no more!

15:32.264 --> 15:35.099
¶ You're so into me ¶

15:35.166 --> 15:39.269
¶ That I'm the only
one you will see ¶

15:39.337 --> 15:44.107
¶ Tell me I'm not
in the blue ¶

15:44.175 --> 15:48.812
¶ Oh, that I'm not a-wastin'
my feelings on you ¶

15:48.880 --> 15:51.782
This is so cool!

15:51.850 --> 15:53.951
¶ Every time I look at you ¶

15:54.018 --> 15:56.320
¶ My heart is jumpin' ¶

15:56.388 --> 15:58.088
¶ What can I do? ¶

15:58.155 --> 16:01.224
¶ You drive me crazy,
I just can't sleep ¶

16:01.292 --> 16:05.028
It's good to see
you smile again.

16:05.096 --> 16:08.399
¶ I'm so excited,
I'm in too deep ¶

16:08.466 --> 16:13.637
¶ Oh, crazy,
but it feels all right ¶

16:13.705 --> 16:15.072
¶ Baby, thinkin' of you
keeps me up all night. ¶

16:15.140 --> 16:18.208
Okay, now it's just weird.

16:18.276 --> 16:20.077
(music stops)

16:21.112 --> 16:22.913
You're not enjoying this,
are you?

16:22.980 --> 16:24.247
No, it's great, it's just...

16:24.315 --> 16:26.449
You know, it's not
that much fun alone.

16:26.517 --> 16:27.951
Tell me about it.

16:28.019 --> 16:30.154
Like you'd know; you're
always surrounded by people.

16:30.221 --> 16:32.622
And sometimes, that's
the loneliest place to be.

16:32.690 --> 16:35.026
You know, maybe that's
why I've been having

16:35.093 --> 16:36.960
these weird one-on-one
dreams so often.

16:37.029 --> 16:38.362
They drive me crazy.

16:39.330 --> 16:40.664
So what am I
supposed to do?

16:40.732 --> 16:43.400
I mean, I can't tell my dad
I want to go back home.

16:43.467 --> 16:44.901
Why not? You know,
he needs to realize

16:44.969 --> 16:46.303
you're not fitting in,
and besides,

16:46.370 --> 16:48.071
you came here
for all the wrong reasons.

16:48.139 --> 16:49.273
Okay, we'll do
it your way--

16:49.341 --> 16:50.307
right foot first.

16:50.375 --> 16:51.475
Easier, huh?

16:51.542 --> 16:52.843
Uh, not really.

16:52.911 --> 16:54.778
So, what do you mean,
"all the wrong reasons"?

16:54.845 --> 16:55.946
Well, it sounds like to me

16:56.048 --> 16:57.581
that you're running away
from your problems--

16:57.648 --> 16:59.115
taking the easy way out.

16:59.183 --> 17:01.252
"Taking the easy way out"--
that's a great idea for a song.

17:01.319 --> 17:02.520
Dibs on royalties.

17:07.157 --> 17:08.791
Could I go home now?

17:08.859 --> 17:09.859
Sure.

17:09.926 --> 17:11.395
Thanks.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.864
Great voice,
but she really needs

17:13.932 --> 17:16.032
to work on the dance moves.

17:16.101 --> 17:17.467
Sabrina, I need to talk to you.

17:17.535 --> 17:19.202
Oh, Dad, I need to
talk to you, too.

17:19.270 --> 17:20.337
I have to go to Pluto.

17:20.405 --> 17:21.371
You first.

17:21.439 --> 17:22.873
A civil war
has broken out there.

17:22.941 --> 17:24.907
Unfortunately, it means
I'm going to be gone

17:24.943 --> 17:26.242
for quite a while.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.179
Now, you're welcome to stay here
with Gail and Donald,

17:28.246 --> 17:30.847
but I think you might
be much happier...

17:30.915 --> 17:31.849
Back home.

17:31.916 --> 17:32.816
Yeah.

17:32.883 --> 17:34.784
Thanks.

17:34.852 --> 17:37.087
SABRINA:
<i>Hello! I'm home!</i>

17:40.358 --> 17:42.158
Where is everybody?

17:42.226 --> 17:44.260
I can't believe Aunt Hilda
and Aunt Zelda went out again.

17:44.328 --> 17:46.296
Dad told them
I was coming home...

17:46.364 --> 17:48.198
Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!

17:49.267 --> 17:51.001
Oh, welcome home, honey.

17:51.068 --> 17:52.436
We missed you.

17:52.504 --> 17:53.837
Sabrini!

17:53.905 --> 17:55.272
"Sabrini"?

17:55.340 --> 17:56.439
I'm so happy you're back!

17:56.507 --> 17:57.941
Put me down.
Sorry.

17:58.008 --> 17:59.309
I'm so glad
to be back,

17:59.377 --> 18:01.745
and I'm so glad
you're glad I'm back.

18:01.813 --> 18:03.546
There are paw prints
in my cake.

18:03.614 --> 18:05.349
When I'm happy, I eat.

18:05.416 --> 18:07.484
I guess we can all thank
that civil war on Pluto.

18:07.552 --> 18:08.919
Is that what it was?

18:08.986 --> 18:10.453
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

18:10.521 --> 18:12.222
Nuh... uh...

18:12.290 --> 18:13.656
(stammering)

18:13.724 --> 18:15.592
But I... I want cake.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.995
It's the other way.

18:18.062 --> 18:20.130
All right, spill.

18:20.198 --> 18:23.967
Did you have anything to do
with this civil war on Pluto?

18:24.035 --> 18:26.503
Define "anything."

18:26.571 --> 18:28.906
Well, I might have made
a few phone calls

18:28.973 --> 18:32.109
to some ne'er-do-well friends
who owe me a favor or two,

18:32.176 --> 18:34.912
but I only did it because
I wanted Sabrina back.

18:34.979 --> 18:38.581
You aren't going to turn me into
the Witches' Council, are you?

18:38.649 --> 18:41.619
Well, something has to be done.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.856
How about I fry you up
a thick salmon filet?

18:45.923 --> 18:47.758
(gasping)

18:47.826 --> 18:50.493
All those years
of warmongering

18:50.561 --> 18:55.198
and this is the first time
anyone's ever said "thank you."

18:57.469 --> 18:59.402
I can't believe
you're back.

18:59.504 --> 19:00.904
I missed you
so much.

19:00.971 --> 19:02.239
I missed you, too,

19:02.307 --> 19:04.774
but you have to let go,
or I can't get in my locker.

19:04.842 --> 19:06.243
Promise you won't
go away again?

19:06.311 --> 19:08.645
I promise-- and promise
you'll change your shirt.

19:08.713 --> 19:10.447
Hey, Brad,
look who's back.

19:10.515 --> 19:11.648
Oh, hey, Sabrina.

19:11.716 --> 19:13.116
Hi, Brad! Thanks,
Paris was great.

19:13.184 --> 19:16.020
I so don't get him.

19:16.087 --> 19:17.688
Hey, Brad.
Yeah, what's up,
partner?

19:17.756 --> 19:20.190
You know, you got to start
being nicer to Sabrina.

19:20.257 --> 19:22.426
I said, "Hey, Sabrina."

19:22.493 --> 19:24.495
Yeah, but next time when
you say, "Hey, Sabrina,"

19:24.562 --> 19:27.831
you got to say it like
you mean, <i>"Hey, Sabrina!"</i>

19:27.899 --> 19:29.933
You must really love this girl.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.367
Yeah.

19:31.435 --> 19:33.436
Don't tell coach.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.638
Oh, no.

19:34.673 --> 19:38.809
Yep, this is going to be
the best year ever.

19:38.876 --> 19:42.680
Miss Spellman, what are
you doing back here?

19:42.714 --> 19:45.015
¶ You drive me crazy ¶

19:45.116 --> 19:47.150
¶ I just can't sleep ¶

19:47.218 --> 19:48.719
What's the matter?

19:48.787 --> 19:51.855
Didn't you ever see
anybody get jiggy before?

19:51.856 --> 19:57.027
¶ Oh, crazy,
but it feels all right ¶

19:57.095 --> 19:59.563
¶ Baby, thinkin' of you
keeps me up all night. ¶

19:59.631 --> 20:01.131
HARVEY:
You know, this was fun

20:01.198 --> 20:03.366
even though we didn't
get to see the show.

20:03.434 --> 20:04.668
SABRINA:
Well, yeah,

20:04.736 --> 20:06.303
but I almost
heard one song.

20:06.337 --> 20:08.706
This has been the
best birthday ever.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.607
Hey, look, there she is!

20:10.675 --> 20:12.442
(all cheering)

20:16.814 --> 20:18.081
Wow, Sabrina!

20:18.148 --> 20:20.383
She looked at you
like she knew you!

20:20.451 --> 20:21.751
Yeah.

20:21.819 --> 20:23.286
In her dreams.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.827
They shoot horses,
don't they?

20:34.866 --> 20:38.268
¶ Baby, I'm so into you ¶

20:38.336 --> 20:40.770
¶ You got that something ¶

20:40.838 --> 20:42.940
¶ What can I do? ¶

20:43.007 --> 20:45.508
¶ Baby ¶

20:45.576 --> 20:48.478
¶ You spin me around ¶

20:48.546 --> 20:50.313
¶ The Earth is movin' ¶

20:50.381 --> 20:53.083
¶ But I can't feel the ground ¶

20:53.151 --> 20:57.254
¶ Every time you look at me ¶

20:57.321 --> 21:01.591
¶ My heart is jumpin',
it's easy to see ¶

21:01.659 --> 21:04.494
¶ You drive me crazy ¶

21:04.562 --> 21:06.863
¶ I just can't sleep ¶

21:06.931 --> 21:09.266
¶ I'm so excited ¶

21:09.334 --> 21:10.901
¶ I'm in too deep ¶

21:10.969 --> 21:16.873
¶ Oh, crazy,
but it feels all right ¶

21:16.941 --> 21:20.343
¶ Baby, thinkin' of you
keeps me up all night. ¶
