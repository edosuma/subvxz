WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.836
<i>Back in the '80s,
my sister, Erica,</i>

00:02.970 --> 00:05.473
<i>and Geoff Schwartz
had quite the love story.</i>

00:05.606 --> 00:08.642
<i>From friends to lovers to exes
and lovers again,</i>

00:08.776 --> 00:10.844
<i>all culminating
in an epic proposal.</i>

00:10.978 --> 00:13.447
<i>Finally, the wedding was here.</i>

00:13.581 --> 00:15.716
It's nice. Peaceful.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.151
Are we in the right place?

00:17.285 --> 00:18.319
And to think
I was worried

00:18.452 --> 00:19.787
your mom would do
something crazy.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.021
I mean,
the Harlem Globetrotters

00:21.155 --> 00:22.523
were at your brother's
bar mitzvah.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.658
Curly Neal dribbled
the entire service.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.394
Well, I guess
she finally heard us.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.162
People really can
grow and change.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.164
Tech rehearsal starts now!

00:30.298 --> 00:31.432
We are two days out.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.168
I want to see sweaty bodies
and high knees.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.636
What's happening?
Why do we need
a tech rehearsal?

00:35.769 --> 00:37.705
I just added a few flourishes
to the ceremony.

00:37.838 --> 00:38.806
Wardrobe!

00:40.708 --> 00:42.376
The wardrobe
is my wedding dress.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.811
No, that's
your fourth change,

00:43.944 --> 00:45.479
so go ahead and put on
these processional outfits

00:45.613 --> 00:46.880
and let's do this.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.850
<i>Yep,
my mom believed
in going big.</i>

00:49.983 --> 00:51.685
Why do I have a sword?
I don't think
I can walk in this.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.688
Oh, you won't be walking.
Good men of Rome!

00:54.822 --> 00:56.357
<i>Then she went even bigger.</i>

00:56.490 --> 00:57.858
Cue the buglers!

00:59.760 --> 01:01.495
<i>Some would say
over the top.</i>

01:01.629 --> 01:03.097
Where are my unicorns?

01:03.231 --> 01:05.233
<i>Way, way over the top.</i>

01:05.366 --> 01:06.500
Unicorns aren't real!

01:06.634 --> 01:07.901
This whole thing
can't be real!

01:08.035 --> 01:10.204
Cue the New Orleans
jazz band!

01:13.841 --> 01:15.409
Wow. She's really
all over the map

01:15.543 --> 01:16.910
with the different styles
and genres.

01:17.044 --> 01:18.346
Yeah, that's the problem.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.148
Cherry blossoms!
Flutter! Now!

01:22.049 --> 01:23.217
How did that happen?

01:23.351 --> 01:25.186
Six men are living
in those trees full-time.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.520
They pee in buckets.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.389
Fire-eaters,
you should be lit by now!

01:29.790 --> 01:31.425
Mom, we have to
talk about this!

01:31.559 --> 01:32.660
One step ahead of you.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.562
We need more. Way more.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.930
And where the hell
are my acrobats?

01:37.064 --> 01:38.532
<i>Yep, those guys
were there, too.</i>

01:38.666 --> 01:40.501
<i>My mom left nothing out.</i>

01:40.634 --> 01:41.635
This looks expensive.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.471
Where the hell
did my mom go?

01:43.604 --> 01:46.240
Something tells me
that giant clamshell
is gonna clue us in.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.342
Here's my big reveal!

01:50.344 --> 01:52.746
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:52.880 --> 01:55.383
<i>♪ But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say</i>

01:58.552 --> 02:00.120
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:00.254 --> 02:02.456
<i>♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪</i>

02:04.158 --> 02:06.026
<i>It was March 2nd,
1980-something,</i>

02:06.160 --> 02:09.062
<i>and my mom had turned
my sister's wedding
into a literal freak show.</i>

02:09.197 --> 02:10.130
<i>Erica was coming undone.</i>

02:10.264 --> 02:11.432
It's all too much.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.833
I think I'm losing it.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.168
I've never seen you
like this.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.337
It's like all your sarcastic,
tough-girl energy

02:16.470 --> 02:18.772
has been sucked away and
replaced with nervous anxiety.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.308
Oh, God! I'm you!

02:20.441 --> 02:22.142
You're me!
We can't have two yous!

02:22.276 --> 02:23.377
I know.
One me is too many!

02:23.511 --> 02:24.612
Trying to watch
the Weather Channel,

02:24.745 --> 02:26.347
and I already missed
the dew point!

02:26.480 --> 02:27.681
The dew point!

02:27.815 --> 02:29.116
You want to know
the weather?

02:29.250 --> 02:30.984
I'm spinning
like a tornado here!

02:31.118 --> 02:32.286
Yeah, sure, whatever.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.654
That's it!
I'm almost your husband,

02:33.787 --> 02:35.856
and it is time
that I stand up for you.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.426
Time to go
confront your mom.
Here I go!

02:38.559 --> 02:39.693
You're not moving.
Building up to it.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.794
Sending the message

02:40.928 --> 02:42.796
from my brain to my muscles.

02:42.930 --> 02:43.664
Here I mostly go!

02:48.068 --> 02:49.169
Mrs. Goldberg, I need...

02:49.303 --> 02:50.738
One second, Geoff,
I've got a troupe

02:50.871 --> 02:52.606
of Chinese acrobats
lost in Delaware.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.309
<i>Ni xuyao shang 95 bei,</i>

02:55.443 --> 02:58.178
<i>huozhe wo hui ba
no shuai dao taikong.</i>

02:58.312 --> 03:00.147
Now, you selfishly
need something

03:00.281 --> 03:02.015
24 hours before
my glorious day?

03:02.149 --> 03:03.817
It is about your
glorious day, actually.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.118
It has turned into something

03:05.253 --> 03:06.554
way bigger
than we expected.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.456
Oh, thank you
for noticing.

03:08.589 --> 03:09.790
It was impossible
not to notice.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.592
You're just saying that.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.427
Are you trying to sweet-talk
your mother-in-law?

03:13.561 --> 03:14.995
No, what
I'm trying to say is,

03:15.128 --> 03:16.697
our small,
intimate ceremony

03:16.830 --> 03:18.799
has turned into
an over-the-top spectacle.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.133
You really think so?

03:20.268 --> 03:21.469
I don't think
you're gonna hear this

03:21.602 --> 03:23.003
how I intend it,
but... Yes?

03:23.136 --> 03:24.838
You know,
I don't say this enough,

03:24.972 --> 03:27.040
but you are not
that bad, Geoffrey.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.976
Now you relax.
I'm gonna confirm

03:29.109 --> 03:31.178
the surprise
musical entertainment.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.847
I'm not gonna give any hints,
but let's just say

03:33.981 --> 03:36.784
it hits all
the right "Marks."

03:36.917 --> 03:38.386
Seems like you're
suggesting it will be

03:38.519 --> 03:39.653
multiple people
named Mark.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.054
Well, aren't you
the sleuth.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.990
Now go enjoy
your last day of freedom.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.558
But don't eat anything,
or else you won't fit

03:44.692 --> 03:46.394
into your sequined
matador costume.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.195
I measured you
in your sleep.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.197
But I don't live
in the same house as you.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.932
I know.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.801
How'd it go?
Extremely terribly.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.236
Oh, God! There's nothing
we can do to stop this!

03:56.370 --> 03:58.539
<i>It was hopeless.
Or was it?</i>

03:58.672 --> 04:01.008
<i>We have a winter storm alert.</i>

04:01.141 --> 04:03.010
<i>We had hoped that
it might miss us,</i>

04:03.143 --> 04:06.580
<i>but now Philadelphia
is directly in the path
of a doozie.</i>

04:06.714 --> 04:07.781
Is this
really happening?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.550
<i>This is really happening, folks.</i>

04:09.683 --> 04:13.086
Yes!
I just heard the word "storm"!

04:13.220 --> 04:14.888
It had better be over a place
that doesn't matter,

04:15.022 --> 04:16.690
like wherever it is
that farmers are.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.427
Nope, right here.
Crazy unseasonal
winter blast.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.028
They're saying
it's gonna be a doozie.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.564
But wait. Oh, no!
The wedding!

04:23.697 --> 04:25.032
Schmoo, don't fret.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.568
I'll just send that nor'easter
back out to the sea

04:27.701 --> 04:30.371
with my endless well
of Mama love.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.439
Yeah.

04:31.572 --> 04:32.873
What exactly
is happening?

04:33.006 --> 04:35.309
Foul tempest,
I banish thee!

04:35.443 --> 04:37.077
The weather,
you can't control it.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.880
Begone, evil squall!

04:40.013 --> 04:41.882
<i>Will you look at that?</i>

04:42.015 --> 04:44.785
<i>Now our storm is actually
changing course!</i>

04:44.918 --> 04:45.919
Changing wha...

04:46.053 --> 04:47.655
<i>In all my years
of meteorology,</i>

04:47.788 --> 04:49.089
<i>I've never seen
anything like this!</i>

04:50.458 --> 04:51.892
<i>No one had.</i>

04:52.025 --> 04:53.727
<i>It had to be
a crazy coincidence, right?</i>

04:53.861 --> 04:55.429
<i>Folks,
we've been spared.</i>

04:56.530 --> 04:58.065
See? It's all good.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.300
We're gettin' married!
Mwah!

05:01.635 --> 05:04.472
I don't... I can't...
How?

05:04.605 --> 05:06.306
Is my mother-in-law
a storm god?

05:06.440 --> 05:08.442
I guess we have
no choice but to accept it.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.678
This wedding is happening.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.446
<i>As Erica
continued to spin,</i>

05:12.580 --> 05:15.649
<i>Barry and I also
had strong feelings
about the big day.</i>

05:15.783 --> 05:18.118
So, what are you planning
for Erica's marriage thingy?

05:18.251 --> 05:19.720
Showing up. You?

05:19.853 --> 05:22.089
I may pop in.
What are you gonna
wear to this shindig?

05:22.222 --> 05:24.291
Mom rented me a tux,
top hat, and tails.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.326
You didn't get the cane?
I don't need a cane!

05:26.460 --> 05:27.761
My legs are made of oak.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.598
I'm using either
a king's scepter
or a tactical hiking axe.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.132
I'm going with
a bejeweled wizard's staff.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.701
Oh! Why?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.769
For upstaging me
with sorcerer's items!

05:35.903 --> 05:37.638
Now I may not go at all.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.073
<i>Meanwhile,
Geoff was going to
stand up to my mom again</i>

05:40.207 --> 05:41.542
<i>by pretending to be sick.</i>

05:43.911 --> 05:45.012
You coughed.
What's happening?

05:45.145 --> 05:47.681
Nothing. I-I just have
this cough, I guess.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.751
Which I guess
you just heard.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.620
There it was again.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.488
Geoffrey, you get married
in less than 23 hours.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.223
You cannot be sick.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.692
Oh, no! You don't think
we may have to delay
the wedding, do you?

05:58.826 --> 05:59.993
That would be awful,
but it's your call,

06:00.127 --> 06:01.128
and definitely
the right one.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.996
Take three cherry drops,
two menthol,

06:03.130 --> 06:04.865
and one of these
weird European ones

06:04.998 --> 06:06.934
that taste like
a yodeler's armpit.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.902
I think it might be
more serious
than just a cough.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.604
What are your symptoms,
Geoffrey?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.406
Because all you
need to be is upright

06:12.540 --> 06:13.874
and able to mumble, "I do."

06:14.007 --> 06:15.208
Well, I'm dizzy.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.978
My tummy's bothering me,
but it's also my head.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.480
My eyeballs are hot.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.914
My teeth are cold.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.717
And is this a thing?
My tongue, it's expanding.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.353
Loog,
ith happenink light mow!

06:26.487 --> 06:27.555
Smart. Call off the wedding.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.123
I'm not calling off

06:30.257 --> 06:32.059
Get me all the doctors!

06:32.192 --> 06:34.562
Doctors? W-We don't need to
bring medical professionals
into this.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.964
We are gonna poke, prod,
and check your fluids,

06:37.097 --> 06:39.366
and if all goes well,
smash you together
good as new!

06:39.500 --> 06:40.768
Adam! Barry!

06:40.901 --> 06:42.770
Is it time for the wedding?
I'm not showering.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.838
I've thought about it,
and I no longer want

06:44.972 --> 06:46.640
the honor of being
the ring bearer.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.241
Mostly 'cause I lost
that tiny pillow.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.210
Nothing to be alarmed about,
but I'm taking Geoffrey

06:50.343 --> 06:52.846
to every physician
in the Philadelphia area.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.248
Sounds right.
How does that concern us?

06:55.382 --> 06:57.217
Since I'll be busy with Geoff,
it means you boys

06:57.350 --> 07:00.020
need to take Erica
to our scheduled
Mother-Daughter Spa Day.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.755
Spa day?
That's girl stuff.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.424
Yeah, do these
rugged hands look like

07:04.558 --> 07:06.694
they would ever take part
in whatever feminine hijinks

07:06.827 --> 07:09.262
goes on in that building
that was clearly
a Taco Bell once?

07:09.396 --> 07:11.899
I'm with Barry.
No Taco Bell toes.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.366
You'll get a pedicure,
a facial,

07:13.501 --> 07:15.035
and a hot-stone massage.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.205
And make sure that Erica
gets the stress relief
she so desperately needs!

07:18.338 --> 07:19.473
Here I go, I guess!

07:19.607 --> 07:21.575
Great. Now we have
to be pampered.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.143
Weddings are
so challenging

07:23.276 --> 07:24.512
for the brothers
of the bride.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.246
<i>As we set off
to relax with Erica,</i>

07:26.379 --> 07:28.181
<i>Geoff was about to do
anything but.</i>

07:28.315 --> 07:29.583
This boy is not well.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.284
Drain him, scan him,
and scrape him,

07:31.418 --> 07:33.286
mouth to exit.
Leave nothing out.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.288
You can leave the exit out!
M-My exit is perfect!

07:35.422 --> 07:36.724
N-Not that I examine it!

07:36.857 --> 07:37.791
I mean, it... It does its job.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.226
Relax.

07:39.359 --> 07:40.628
Let's explore.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.230
<i>As Geoff
did anything but relax,</i>

07:43.363 --> 07:45.032
<i>that's all we were doing.</i>

07:45.165 --> 07:47.801
Robes? I don't do well
in loosely-bound clothing.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.638
I'm a magnet for ill-timed
breezes and errant doorknobs.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.273
Love your body, Adam.
I love mine.

07:53.406 --> 07:54.508
It's why
I don't use the belt.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.809
Well, you should.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.410
I'm already freaking out
about this wedding.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.279
There can't be more
for me to unsee.

07:59.412 --> 08:00.914
What's her problem?
Who am I?

08:01.048 --> 08:02.482
The guy who
wants to know her?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.652
Oh, my God,
you two dopes
are so lucky.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.186
No one will ever
marry you.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.821
Oh, no, thank you!

08:07.955 --> 08:09.122
I don't like it when
people touch my...

08:09.256 --> 08:11.892
F... Hachi machi!
Ooh, please do not stop

08:12.025 --> 08:13.661
until you are legally
mandated to.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.764
<i>And so,
our very different
journeys began.</i>

08:16.897 --> 08:19.299
<i>As we found ourselves in
a state of deep relaxation...</i>

08:19.432 --> 08:20.834
Oh, yeah.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.502
Yeah, really get in there.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.772
<i>...Geoff, on the other hand,
did not.</i>

08:24.905 --> 08:26.273
Please don't make me
go in there! Please!

08:26.406 --> 08:28.976
Oh, man.
That is cool.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.444
Uncool! Shouldn't I
be wearing a lead vest?

08:33.246 --> 08:34.447
Do hot stones hurt?

08:34.582 --> 08:35.649
Do spinal taps hurt?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.118
Ooh.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.219
Ohh!

08:39.352 --> 08:41.254
Ooh!

08:41.388 --> 08:42.322
Aah!

08:42.455 --> 08:43.791
Today was so nice.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.358
Thank you guys
so much for coming
with me.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.127
I had a great time.
This was amazing.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.629
Wait. Are you guys crying?

08:48.762 --> 08:51.699
All these luxurious treatments
have opened up things in me.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.300
I know.
I'm examining my life

08:53.433 --> 08:54.868
in ways I never have before.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.470
I'm just so happy
that you're marrying Geoff.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.106
It's just so beautiful.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.741
It really is.
For the first time,

09:00.874 --> 09:03.310
my pores
and my heart are open.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.278
You're marrying
my best friend. Oh.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.816
I would go over there,
but it's just too far.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.183
<i>While the spa
made us right,</i>

09:10.317 --> 09:12.152
<i>the doctor couldn't find
anything wrong.</i>

09:12.285 --> 09:14.021
We've run every test
imaginable, son.

09:14.154 --> 09:17.190
I mean, some not
in the least bit routine
for a man of your age.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.126
The mammogram
did give me pause.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.194
I can't find
anything wrong with you.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.096
Well, then there
has obviously been an error.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.364
Geoff, back in the tube.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.800
No, don't make me go back in
that mean robot's belly!

09:26.934 --> 09:28.902
Have you been feeling
any stress recently?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.904
A little.
Got a wedding coming up.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.507
I have a diagnosis...

09:34.642 --> 09:36.977
A classic case
of cold feet.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.012
Impossible.
Geoff loves Erica.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.714
All he wants to do
is marry her.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.416
It's too bad
that Dr. Cold Hands
here couldn't help me.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.920
Guess I'll have to
go tell Erica the bad news...

09:47.054 --> 09:48.922
We'll have to
indefinitely postpone.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.825
<i>And that's
when my mom made
a diagnosis of her own...</i>

09:51.959 --> 09:54.061
<i>Geoff was full of</i>

09:56.163 --> 09:57.397
<i>After being
forced by our mom</i>

09:57.530 --> 09:59.399
<i>into a pre-wedding day
of relaxation,</i>

09:59.532 --> 10:01.334
<i>my siblings and I
were riding high.</i>

10:01.468 --> 10:03.203
Spas are the best!

10:03.336 --> 10:05.673
Who knew my skin, nails,
and brows

10:05.806 --> 10:07.240
could look as perfect
as the rest of me?

10:07.374 --> 10:09.609
Lately I've been feeling crazy
with all this wedding stuff,

10:09.743 --> 10:11.912
so I'm really happy
that we got to do
this spa thing together,

10:12.045 --> 10:13.113
the three of us.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.215
Sis, we're the lucky ones.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.651
We got several uninterrupted
hours with the bride!

10:17.785 --> 10:19.787
I don't see why we shouldn't
do this every weekend.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.454
We're spa siblings now.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.456
Spa siblings?
I love it.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.927
Is she the best?

10:27.060 --> 10:29.596
I feel like she's the best,
and we've taken it for granted
our entire lives.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.064
Definitely.
We gotta do something

10:31.198 --> 10:32.800
to keep her
in a good head space
this weekend.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.435
What if we made her a batch
of that cucumber water
from the spa?

10:35.568 --> 10:38.571
Yes! To the crisper drawer!

10:38.706 --> 10:42.575
Beverly, for the,
uh, ceremonial smashing
of the glass,

10:42.710 --> 10:45.645
will a liturgical broom
and dustpan be provided,

10:45.779 --> 10:47.781
or is the one
from my garage okay?

10:47.915 --> 10:50.617
Forget the wasteful ancient
traditions of my people!

10:50.751 --> 10:51.819
We got a bigger problem.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.887
The groom is
the picture of health.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.055
Well, that sounds
like good news

10:55.188 --> 10:56.724
for a young man
about to be wed.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.827
It's not. The doctor says
he's got a raging case
of the yips.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.795
Ooh.
Yeah, that burns.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.031
No! It means
he's got cold feet.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.267
Oh, my. And as
the terrifying mother
of the bride,

11:07.400 --> 11:09.837
I trust that you're gonna
give him the space
and time he needs

11:09.970 --> 11:11.071
to come to his senses?

11:11.204 --> 11:13.140
I am gonna bring
so much pain,

11:13.273 --> 11:14.875
he'll need a second epidural
after the one

11:15.008 --> 11:16.309
I forced him to get earlier.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.679
I may be but a humble deacon
masking as a rabbi

11:19.813 --> 11:21.681
for the wedding
of my boss' daughter,

11:21.815 --> 11:25.118
but that is a bad idea.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.487
It could permanently affect
your relationship with Erica.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.056
Erica. Crap!

11:29.189 --> 11:30.557
I forgot she was
even part of this!

11:32.425 --> 11:33.560
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.628
We wallop Geoff
with these cukes and picks?

11:35.763 --> 11:37.030
It's time
the brothers Goldberg

11:37.164 --> 11:38.932
had a little chat
with the groom.

11:39.066 --> 11:42.269
<i>And so,
Barry and I set out
to defend our spa sibling</i>

11:42.402 --> 11:44.404
<i>by giving Geoff a little
special treatment of his own.</i>

11:44.537 --> 11:45.906
Nice style choice, fellas.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.707
Barry, you look like
David Bowie

11:47.841 --> 11:49.309
in his business-chic years,
and, Adam,

11:49.442 --> 11:51.144
you look like Meryl Streep
in <i>Kramer vs. Kramer.</i>

11:51.278 --> 11:53.080
That is so kind.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.182
She had so much
gravitas and...

11:55.315 --> 11:57.150
And we're tough guys!
That's right.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.753
We exude danger,
and you're terrified of us

11:59.887 --> 12:01.054
and the lines
we might cross.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.455
The only thing
I'm terrified about

12:02.589 --> 12:04.157
is that I haven't
offered you
a lemonade.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.458
Will you guys get
on in here?

12:05.592 --> 12:06.693
Don't tell me what to do.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.196
I tell you what to do
'cause I'm bad cop.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.031
And you know what?
I'm also bad cop!

12:11.164 --> 12:12.866
Dude, we can't both
be bad cop.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.201
It's twice as intense.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.869
Which gives him
no reason to trust us.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.905
Who are you,
good bad cop?

12:18.038 --> 12:19.539
Did you guys
need something, or...

12:19.672 --> 12:21.174
You say nothing!
Talk and die!

12:22.509 --> 12:24.111
Whoa!

12:24.244 --> 12:25.712
Tell us why
you don't wanna
marry Erica!

12:25.846 --> 12:27.180
What? Who said that?

12:27.314 --> 12:29.382
Tell us why you're gonna smash
our sister's delicate heart

12:29.516 --> 12:30.583
into a million tiny pieces!

12:32.085 --> 12:34.721
Barry? Adam?
What's going on?

12:34.855 --> 12:37.424
Your brothers are trying
to intimidate me
for some reason.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.959
I hate that you have to
learn it this way,

12:39.092 --> 12:41.028
but since
we are spa siblings,
you must know...

12:41.161 --> 12:42.429
Geoff, he doesn't wanna
marry you.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.364
And we'll take
any number of
household items

12:44.497 --> 12:45.565
to do harm upon him.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.234
Because spa siblings.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.602
I do wanna marry Erica,
and what the hell
is a spa sibling?

12:49.736 --> 12:52.940
Aw, did you guys threaten
my fiance on my behalf?

12:53.073 --> 12:54.374
Wow, we really did
bond today.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.177
So hard.
Family finally means
something to me.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.112
And Geoff doesn't have
cold feet.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.214
He's just faking sick
to get out of the wedding.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.616
If you wanna get married,
why are you trying to
get out of it?

13:03.750 --> 13:06.019
Because Mom planned
the most over-the-top ceremony

13:06.153 --> 13:07.420
of all time.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.822
Geoff was just trying
to give me what I want.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.390
Aww.
He cherishes you.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.624
I really do.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.593
I know that
only moments ago,
we were planning

13:13.726 --> 13:15.195
on committing violence
upon you,

13:15.328 --> 13:16.964
but now all that rage
has turned into

13:17.097 --> 13:17.931
a mushy clump of love.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.666
We're all spa siblings!

13:19.799 --> 13:21.601
I guess since this whole
sick thing didn't work out,

13:21.734 --> 13:23.136
there's only one thing
left to do.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.838
Hide in the attic like I did
when my dad tried

13:24.972 --> 13:26.306
to make the family walk
the Freedom Trail?

13:26.439 --> 13:27.507
It's like
a hundred miles long.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.542
No. It's my wedding.

13:29.676 --> 13:30.944
I gotta stand up
to my mom.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.379
That's not
gonna end well.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.680
Probably not.
But she's not gonna
do it alone.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.415
We're a team.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.950
<i>While our feelings toward
Geoff had warmed,</i>

13:37.084 --> 13:38.618
<i>it seemed
the weather had not.</i>

13:38.751 --> 13:40.988
What do you mean
all flights are canceled?

13:41.121 --> 13:43.123
<i>Baruch ata adonai...</i>

13:43.256 --> 13:45.458
Aunt Ida, just, uh,
hand the phone

13:45.592 --> 13:47.527
to the witch typing loudly
in the background.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.762
<i>Melech ha-olam...</i>

13:49.897 --> 13:52.265
Is that the proper amount
of guilt and phlegm?

13:52.399 --> 13:54.401
I don't care
what the FAA says,

13:54.534 --> 13:57.604
the BEV says open
all the gates!

13:57.737 --> 13:59.973
No one's ever been killed
by a little ice.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.976
Actually,
Grandfather Antoine
met the Lord

14:03.110 --> 14:06.279
while grabbing
the <i>Ottawa Journal</i>
on our driveway sleet.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.249
<i>Olav ha-sholom,</i>
Pappy Brown.

14:09.382 --> 14:12.019
Don't you put me on hold...
D... Dammit!

14:12.152 --> 14:13.320
Beverly,
we have big problems.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.623
Cousin Hertzel
is stuck in Newark!

14:16.756 --> 14:18.591
And I heard that Geoffrey
wasn't feeling well

14:18.725 --> 14:22.295
from multiple calls from
our panicked insurance agent.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.098
Relax, Linda, I made sure
he had every tube,

14:25.232 --> 14:26.699
needle, and camera
jabbed into him.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.801
And do you know what
the diagnosis was?
Cold feet.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.303
Like frostbite?

14:30.437 --> 14:34.507
Oh, Lou's side does
have a history
of terrible circulation.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.843
And your whole family
are Ferrignos?

14:36.977 --> 14:38.211
Oh, my God!
You're all so stressed

14:38.345 --> 14:40.213
and miserable.
It's hilarious.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.916
Everyone stop!
I don't have cold feet!

14:43.050 --> 14:45.318
Yes! So my plan
to not kill you
was the right one.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.287
We need to talk about
the wedding.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.855
Erica, believe me,
Mama will make sure

14:48.989 --> 14:50.523
that everything goes
as planned.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.892
That's just the thing...
Hey!

14:53.026 --> 14:56.629
<i>The storm is back and tracking
right into us, folks.</i>

14:56.763 --> 14:59.699
<i>Please, cancel those plans
and stay inside.</i>

14:59.832 --> 15:02.002
No! I diverted you once,
Mother Nature,
and I'll do it again.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.804
Move, wretched blizzard!

15:04.938 --> 15:06.739
<i>Not if my sister
had anything to do with it.</i>

15:06.873 --> 15:07.840
Come on, storm buddy.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.843
Ice us!
Ice us but good!

15:10.978 --> 15:13.546
<i>The temperature is dropping
incredibly fast.</i>

15:13.680 --> 15:15.448
They have
a concerning amount
of confidence

15:15.582 --> 15:17.150
in their sway on nature.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.519
Erica, you're moving
the storm the wrong way!

15:19.652 --> 15:21.621
I'm moving it
right where I want it!

15:21.754 --> 15:23.756
Stop! It's for our
dream wedding!

15:23.890 --> 15:26.259
This isn't
my dream wedding,
it's yours!

15:26.393 --> 15:27.727
How dare you.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.896
I have been working non-stop
to make everything perfect.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.431
How dare you!

15:31.564 --> 15:33.533
I wanted something
simple and sweet,

15:33.666 --> 15:35.168
but you've turned it
into a literal circus.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.869
I think I saw
a bearded lady.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.371
That may have been
my Great Aunt Edna.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.073
She has pituitary issues.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.077
Oh. Well,
I hope you're happy,

15:44.211 --> 15:46.113
'cause now it looks
like there's not gonna
be a wedding.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.981
Of course I'm not happy, Mom.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.716
I can't wait to marry Geoff,

15:49.849 --> 15:52.252
but I just want it to be
my wedding and not yours.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.495
<i>Thanks to the weather,</i>

16:02.629 --> 16:04.464
<i>Erica and Geoff's wedding
was off.</i>

16:04.597 --> 16:06.066
<i>But an unexpected ice storm...</i>

16:07.534 --> 16:08.801
<i>...wasn't the only surprise
that day.</i>

16:09.902 --> 16:11.304
Are you...

16:11.438 --> 16:14.241
Rock-Pop sensation
Richard Marx?

16:14.374 --> 16:15.375
In the smoking-hot flesh.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.144
Not the real Richard Marx.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.811
No, I definitely am
the real Richard Marx.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.447
Look at
my lustrous hair.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.582
This gorgeous mane sold
10 million albums alone.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.817
And this smile? Another 10.

16:24.951 --> 16:28.055
If you're
the real Richard Marx,
then how big is a Grammy?

16:28.188 --> 16:30.557
Well, I don't think you
have to be Richard Marx
to know that, but...

16:30.690 --> 16:32.459
About yea big.
It is him.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.027
<i>The man who wrote
Don't Mean Nothin'</i>

16:34.161 --> 16:35.795
about the perils of
the entertainment business.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.630
Serious question,
who's that for?

16:37.764 --> 16:40.333
Look, your mother hired me
to play a wedding,
but the roads are closed,

16:40.467 --> 16:41.934
so I wanted to
return her check.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.539
Richard Marx
is a class act.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.641
It's true.
Global superstardom

16:48.775 --> 16:51.411
and endless wealth
haven't changed me.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.281
Anyway, it's really bad
out here. Could I come in?

16:54.414 --> 16:56.383
Although I do feel like
I know you intimately

16:56.516 --> 16:57.984
because of
your emotional lyrics,

16:58.118 --> 16:59.386
you're still a stranger.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.720
Dad!
What?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.422
Can Richard Marx come in?
No!

17:02.555 --> 17:04.291
But I'm Richard Marx.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.859
He's always grumpy.
Just don't set up
in front of the TV.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.196
I've written
a ton of power ballads.
You, uh, wanna hear 'em?

17:09.329 --> 17:10.797
Not even a little.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.865
<i>As we
welcomed in
a global pop star,</i>

17:12.999 --> 17:14.534
<i>my mom had to face
her own music.</i>

17:14.667 --> 17:15.635
Hey.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.404
Hey.
Errm.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.005
I want to tell you something.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.507
What? Did one of
the unicorns

17:20.640 --> 17:21.874
accidentally gouge
a fire-eater?

17:22.675 --> 17:23.843
I am sorry.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.881
I wanted to throw you
a wedding as big
as the love I have for you

17:30.183 --> 17:31.684
instead of the one
you really wanted.

17:31.818 --> 17:35.388
Mom, I tried to tell you,
the wedding of my dreams

17:35.522 --> 17:37.490
just needs this guy
that I'm crazy about

17:37.624 --> 17:39.192
and the people
that we love
around us.

17:39.326 --> 17:40.293
Nothing more.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.928
I see that now.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.863
Um, well, come on.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.998
I want to show you something.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.501
Oh, you might want to
put on your dress and tux.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.643
<i>And so,
in the house she grew up in,</i>

17:56.776 --> 17:59.246
<i>surrounded by
all the people she loved,</i>

17:59.379 --> 18:03.116
<i>what was the biggest wedding
in Jenkintown history</i>

18:03.250 --> 18:04.584
<i>became the smallest.</i>

18:04.717 --> 18:07.487
<i>And it was just
what Erica wanted.</i>

18:10.990 --> 18:13.126
Oh, my God.
This is incredible.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.627
My little peanut.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.530
Yeah, well, your brothers
took care of most of it.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.632
For you,
we'd do anything.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.604
We don't say it enough,
but we love you, sis.

18:24.737 --> 18:25.705
So much.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.073
That's so sweet.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.309
And holy crap.
Is that Richard Marx?

18:29.442 --> 18:31.578
Damn right it is. Hello.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.080
He's the only thing
I kept from the original celebration.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.047
Is it okay?

18:35.182 --> 18:37.049
Mom, this is perfect.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.351
Thank you.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.456
Sweetheart.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.264
You ready?

18:51.398 --> 18:54.100
I've never been more ready
for anything in my life.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.703
<i>So,
under the glow of
our candlelit living room,</i>

18:56.836 --> 18:59.506
<i>Erica and Geoff,
high school sweethearts,</i>

18:59.639 --> 19:00.640
<i>got hitched.</i>

19:02.542 --> 19:04.911
Sometimes, the right guy has
always been there,

19:05.044 --> 19:08.147
carrying a cello
and unable to eat Thai food.

19:09.282 --> 19:12.485
But I love your kindness,
your compassion,

19:12.619 --> 19:16.789
your endless patience,
and your love.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.959
<i>It wasn't
what they had planned.</i>

19:20.092 --> 19:24.331
You've never washed a dish,
nor accepted any criticism

19:24.464 --> 19:25.665
in the gentle way
I intended.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.302
But you've also
never backed down
from a fight

19:29.436 --> 19:30.670
when you knew it was
the right thing to do.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.173
I love your strength.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.875
I love your courage.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.710
I even love your family.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.748
But mostly, I love you.

19:47.153 --> 19:50.290
<i>But it turned out to be
the perfect night</i>

19:50.423 --> 19:52.792
<i>for the perfect couple.</i>

19:52.925 --> 19:55.127
By the power
vested in me,

19:55.262 --> 19:57.697
by the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania,

19:57.830 --> 19:59.699
I pronounce you man and wife.

19:59.832 --> 20:00.933
You may kiss the bride.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.202
<i>♪ Wherever you go</i>

20:03.336 --> 20:06.205
<i>♪ Whatever you do</i>

20:06.339 --> 20:11.544

20:11.678 --> 20:14.381
<i>♪ Whatever it takes</i>

20:14.514 --> 20:17.550
<i>♪ Or how my heart breaks...</i>

20:17.684 --> 20:19.185

20:19.319 --> 20:22.389
<i>We all felt the love
in the house that night</i>

20:22.522 --> 20:24.957
<i>as our families joined
to become one.</i>

20:27.093 --> 20:28.395
<i>It was a dream come true.</i>

20:33.800 --> 20:37.770
<i>for my parents, for all of us.</i>

20:37.904 --> 20:39.339
<i>♪ I will be right here

20:39.472 --> 20:41.541
My baby's married!

20:52.218 --> 20:54.521
Excuse me. I was wondering
if I could maybe get
my check back now?

20:54.654 --> 20:56.423
Your check
for what exactly,
Richard Marx?

20:56.556 --> 20:58.257
For my performance.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.426
I kinda nailed it.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.227
Oh, my. A certain
platinum artist

21:01.361 --> 21:03.195
is very big
for his britches.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.464
Well, I'll tell you what.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.798
I'm gonna write down
a number,

21:05.932 --> 21:08.568
and you can either
take it or leave it.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.270
That is not a number.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.739
And why would I
do that to myself?

21:12.872 --> 21:14.941
Oh, boo-hoo.
Write a sad song about it.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.109
Oh, I will! And it'll be
a number-one smash hit!

21:17.243 --> 21:18.244
There you go.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.512
And I'm taking this!

21:20.613 --> 21:22.715
Beautiful hair.
You, too.
