01:49.457 --> 01:53.591
Loose change, small change!

01:53.722 --> 01:55.811
Spare change?

01:55.941 --> 02:01.686
Hey. Happy Friday!

02:01.817 --> 02:06.256
Thank you, sir!

02:06.387 --> 02:08.519
Ruby, did you pick up more ketchup and mustard?

02:08.650 --> 02:10.913
Was I clocked in?

02:11.043 --> 02:12.871
No...

02:13.002 --> 02:16.527
Then what do you think, grandma?

02:16.658 --> 02:20.575
We should really only be hiring people over 18.

02:20.705 --> 02:23.360
17, not bad.

02:23.491 --> 02:30.411
Not good enough.

02:30.541 --> 02:38.158
Hey Ray... Ray! There's another bumoutside harassing customers!

02:38.288 --> 02:41.117
Ray!

02:41.248 --> 02:44.729
Oh, please.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.296
Hey!

02:46.427 --> 02:48.385
[Panhandling] Small change? Loose change?

02:48.516 --> 02:50.213
Hey, hey you!

02:50.344 --> 02:51.823
Can't you read?

02:51.954 --> 02:53.956
Because I'm drunk you think I cannot read?

02:54.086 --> 02:56.480
Because you're a drunk?

02:56.611 --> 02:58.047
Well you're gonna be a drunk with a shoe
up your ass if you don't move it along!

02:58.178 --> 03:01.659
Leave me alone, bitch!

03:01.790 --> 03:11.930
Mother fucker!

03:12.061 --> 03:15.151
Hey, sweet cheeks!

03:15.282 --> 03:17.501
That's me- Robert G. Wells.

03:17.632 --> 03:22.289
I may only be 24 years old, but I'm
wise beyond my years.

03:22.419 --> 03:25.205
Maybe because my parents chose to
have me in their 50's.

03:25.335 --> 03:26.771
Like, seriously? Who does that?

03:26.902 --> 03:29.034
Fuckin' hippies.

03:29.165 --> 03:32.081
I'm not much of a morning person, but one
thing that gets me up more than coffee

03:32.212 --> 03:34.649
is titties in my face.

03:34.779 --> 03:36.041
Yeah?

03:36.172 --> 03:41.569
Another cup of coffee, please.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.832
Anything else?

03:43.962 --> 03:51.970
Some scrambled eggs - no no no. Over easy.Side of bacon... and a check.

03:52.101 --> 03:55.974
Interesting.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.889
What's that?

03:58.020 --> 04:03.634
Huh.. you. Reading the newspaper.
Who does that anymore?

04:03.765 --> 04:07.247
I'm just skimming the job section.
My former employers no longer needed me.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.944
Those fuckin' dickheads!

04:09.074 --> 04:12.077
Plus, not every day do you get to readabout the mayor of Los Angeles

04:12.208 --> 04:13.209
getting killed!

04:13.340 --> 04:16.865
I really liked that Victor Santos.

04:16.995 --> 04:20.303
You know there's something called the
internet these days. Much faster.

04:20.434 --> 04:25.047
And uh... modern.

04:25.177 --> 04:29.530
Mayor Santos... was killed a month ago.

04:29.660 --> 04:34.752
May God rest his soul. But I refuse to
give it to the robot pussy generation.

04:34.883 --> 04:38.234
Except for getting laid. Now, you ever hadthat Tinder thing, or tried it?

04:38.365 --> 04:42.456
That shit is gonna put hookers completely
out of business, I tell you. Watch.

04:42.586 --> 04:49.767
Yeah. Uh... I'll get your waitress.

04:49.898 --> 04:56.992
Hey... sorry I'm late. Still dealing with
that damn financial aid.

04:57.122 --> 05:02.345
They say I need a loan. But in order for meto get a loan I need a cosigner.

05:02.476 --> 05:06.697
In order for me to get a cosigner,
I need someone with good credit...

05:06.828 --> 05:09.961
Okay, okay... Just... breathe. Just breathe.

05:10.092 --> 05:14.270
We'll go out after work. We'll go to a bar,
get ourselves a few adult drinks. We'll

05:14.401 --> 05:16.838
figure out this problem together. Ok?

05:16.968 --> 05:21.973
That sounds good. That sounds.. thank you.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.802
Okay. Okay.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.108
Alright. Any tables?

05:26.238 --> 05:28.153
Yeah, you've got that weirdo over
at table 6.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.677
How long has he been there for?

05:29.807 --> 05:31.069
10 minutes.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.376
Jesus.

05:33.507 --> 05:36.771
Don't worry. I'll take care of him. He just
ordered a coffee, I flashed him my tits.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.076
It'll be fine.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.340
[Giggles] of course you did.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.037
Okay.

05:42.167 --> 05:47.608
Alright. get yourself together.It's Friday. Today's a big day for tips.

05:47.738 --> 05:50.045
Don't want you missing out on potentialcollege tuition money, okay?

05:50.175 --> 05:51.002
You're right, you're right.

05:51.133 --> 05:54.310
Go.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.878
Hey, Donna...

05:57.008 --> 05:58.053
Yeah?

05:58.183 --> 06:00.708
Listen. I just want to say...

06:00.838 --> 06:07.889
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll thank meafter you get that diploma.

06:08.019 --> 06:12.981
Alright, there you go. And here's your
receipt. Can I get you anything else?

06:13.111 --> 06:18.508
Besides jump-in sex with you? Maybe
a few more cups of joe?

06:18.639 --> 06:21.772
Are you paying with cash or card?

06:21.903 --> 06:29.737
Card. Gimme a second.

06:29.867 --> 06:33.958
Thank you Mr. Andre. Lewinski, I'll be backwith your receipt. Do you have

06:34.089 --> 06:35.960
your ID on you?

06:36.091 --> 06:40.008
I left it in my car. I park 8 blocks up
the street now.You wouldn't make a

06:40.138 --> 06:43.054
man with chronic arthritis in his footwalk 8 blocks, would you?

06:43.185 --> 06:50.366
Okay.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.761
Um... Mr. Lewinski?

06:53.891 --> 07:00.376
Oh. Good. Now feel free to leaveyourself a handsome tip.

07:00.507 --> 07:03.248
Actually it didn't go through.

07:03.379 --> 07:07.949
No problem. Try this one.

07:08.079 --> 07:10.778
Thank you.

07:10.908 --> 07:16.436
Mr. Lewinski... this card says Lucho.

07:16.566 --> 07:20.309
Oh. Y'know, Lucho is my Asian namewhen I travel there on business.

07:20.440 --> 07:26.358
You know how the saying goes, "when
in China...?" Be a fuckin' Chinaman.

07:26.489 --> 07:31.320
Look. I know it sounds like a crazy
story, but it's truly an honest one.

07:31.451 --> 07:45.639
Now, I've been known to tip veryhandsomely. Please don't make me beg.

07:45.769 --> 07:49.947
Please go through, please go through,
please go through...

07:50.078 --> 07:55.431
Alright, Mr. Lewinski. Or... Lucho. It went through.

07:55.562 --> 08:07.399
Ah! I knew it. Now, as promised, a handsome tipfor a very handsome woman.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.184
Here you go sweetheart.

08:09.314 --> 08:20.804
Thanks. And thanks, I guess.

08:20.935 --> 08:51.095
[instrumental music]

08:51.226 --> 09:04.108
[Spanish speaking]

09:04.239 --> 09:16.730
Juan. If you wake up your uncleyou're going to be in trouble.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.296
Dio! Dio!

09:18.427 --> 09:20.516
Don't "Dio" me.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.518
I'm sorry the boys woke you, Diego.

09:22.649 --> 09:26.130
It's okay. I'll handle this.

09:26.261 --> 09:33.355
Miguel, Juan. Center front.

09:33.485 --> 09:46.890
Fee fi fo fum. Who has awakened me?

09:47.021 --> 09:53.331
Since neither one of you will admit it,
I guess you'll both get the fury.

09:53.462 --> 10:00.512
So who's first?

10:00.643 --> 10:05.343
Okay boys. Your uncle has to get to work

10:05.474 --> 10:07.650
C'mon. Your mom's right

10:07.781 --> 10:09.086
What time is it?

10:09.217 --> 10:13.134
You have exactly 34 minutes to get ready and get out.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.266
Why didn't anybody wake me earlier?

10:15.397 --> 10:18.705
You were sleeping so peaceful. I know you
had a long week. I don't want my baby brother

10:18.835 --> 10:20.707
to work himself to death.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.534
I'm fine. I should be worrying about you.

10:22.665 --> 10:25.189
I'm fine.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.628
C'mon. You're worn. How are you feeling today?

10:28.758 --> 10:33.502
Better! Much better. [Spanish speaking]

10:33.633 --> 10:34.590
You promised me you'd relax today.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.723
I have to work

10:36.853 --> 10:43.425
I'm serious.

10:43.555 --> 10:56.612
Y'know... Pop's looking down on you. I know
he'd be proud. You just worry me sometimes!

10:56.743 --> 11:04.272
I'm fine. Doctors say my ?] isn't
terminal like Papi's was. So I'll be fine.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.666
Get to work! Vamo vamo!

11:06.796 --> 11:12.193
And your uniform is in the bathroom near
the shower. Don't be afraid to jump in

11:12.323 --> 11:13.585
you're a little funky.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.675
Yay! Yay!

11:15.805 --> 11:22.029
Oh, y'all got jokes today! Okay!Alright, I got something for you.

11:22.159 --> 11:29.384
One more thing, one more thing.Boys, go into the bedroom.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.212
What is it?

11:31.342 --> 11:35.999
We're short on rent. $500 behind.

11:36.130 --> 11:42.876
It's okay. I'll work double shifts thisweekend. Today's payday...

11:43.006 --> 11:47.489
so... don't worry about it.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.797
I'll buy a few groceries. You getthe prescriptions you need?

11:50.927 --> 11:52.276
No.

11:52.407 --> 11:53.756
Porque?

11:53.887 --> 11:57.107
It's too expensive. It's not a big deal.

11:57.238 --> 12:02.417
Don't be crazy. Gimme the list you need!
Grab the list of prescriptions you need.

12:02.547 --> 12:08.902
Hurry up, get it!

12:09.032 --> 12:12.862
I'm gonna take care of this. Where's Mami?

12:12.993 --> 12:17.562
The kitchen as usual, reading her Bible.
That woman's gone crazy, especially since

12:17.693 --> 12:20.043
Papi died.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.566
What's wrong with reading the Bible and
praying?

12:21.697 --> 12:26.746
Nothing, it's just that she does it all
day every day. Even Jesus and Moses

12:26.876 --> 12:31.489
got their grove on every now and then.

12:31.620 --> 12:35.406
You should hook Mami up with one ofthose old guys at your job!

12:35.537 --> 12:39.280
[Spanish speaking]

12:39.410 --> 12:51.945
I'll talk to her. I just wish she'd learna little more English though!

12:52.075 --> 12:54.904
Hola Mami.

12:55.035 --> 12:57.472
You need to shower!

12:57.602 --> 12:58.734
C'mon, Mom.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.214
Shower. Ahora.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.345
I'm out for work. I'll see you later,
alright?

13:01.476 --> 13:06.481
Mhm.

13:06.611 --> 13:11.312
[Laughing] Y'know it's crazy when you'rediagnosed with Alzheimer's...

13:11.442 --> 13:13.880
It's like you have good trips and then you
have bad trips. Y'know, sometimes

13:14.010 --> 13:17.100
I don't know if she's on a good trip
or a bad trip.

13:17.231 --> 13:24.020
[laughing] Y'know, cause you don't know
how they're gonna react.

13:24.151 --> 13:29.156
What the...? Okay, listen. I came here
today and I gave some hard-earned time

13:29.286 --> 13:39.253
so I could make you laugh, and this guy is
just playing with his yarn like he's a cat!

13:39.383 --> 13:40.994
When she was little she had a lot
of pimples.

13:41.124 --> 13:41.559
Really?

13:41.690 --> 13:44.127
Yeah.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.129
Alright everybody, sing along now!

13:46.260 --> 13:52.353
[singing] this is why I'm happy, and you
can be too! If you smile you won't be blue!

13:52.483 --> 13:55.399
So sing along to my happy song, sing along
to my happy song!

13:55.530 --> 13:59.577
[grunting sound]

13:59.708 --> 14:04.495
Mr. Rogers! Stop it! What did I tell
you about that?

14:04.626 --> 14:11.938
Hey! Can't an old man get his rocks off?I refuse to die with blue balls!

14:12.068 --> 14:16.464
I got enough of a load down here to blow
the roof off this place. Let me live!

14:16.594 --> 14:22.687
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

14:22.818 --> 14:28.737
Now, what did you say your name was?

14:28.868 --> 14:34.264
Mom. It's me. Robert. Bob. I'm your son.

14:34.395 --> 14:40.227
I know you're my son, asshole. Ijust forgot your name.

14:40.357 --> 14:54.415
Are you my eldest? Or, wait. I remember.
You're Odis! It's all coming back to me now!

14:54.545 --> 15:00.812
Ma. Odis is your husband. My father.

15:00.943 --> 15:08.603
Oh yeah. Where is that old two-timing
bastard? Is he screwing my sister?

15:08.733 --> 15:14.609
I knew she was gonna be a whore themoment she was born. The way she

15:14.739 --> 15:19.614
sucked on that baby bottle.

15:19.744 --> 15:26.664
Ma. Dad's gone... he's dead. So is your
brother and your sister.

15:26.795 --> 15:31.887
Ma. You understand?

15:32.018 --> 15:40.896
Odis. You wanna dance?

15:41.027 --> 15:48.948
Yes. I'll dance with you, Louis.

15:49.078 --> 16:04.006
[music]

16:04.137 --> 16:06.704
Sorry, did I interrupt your little date
right here?

16:06.835 --> 16:08.880
Beat it. My wife and I need a little
privacy.

16:09.011 --> 16:09.969
Okay, I'll be right back.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.667
No, I'm just playin' with you man.

16:12.797 --> 16:23.547
C'mon, she's all yours. Louis, have aseat. You got it? There you go.

16:23.678 --> 16:26.550
Get some water.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.814
I got it.

16:29.945 --> 16:33.557
Open up, Louis. Take some water.

16:33.688 --> 16:37.779
There you go. Swallow.

16:37.909 --> 16:43.176
Don't mind if I do. That's howmy knees got so strong.

16:43.306 --> 16:48.616
Ah! Ma! You see where I get it from?

16:48.746 --> 16:55.623
Hey. Ma. Let's play the quiet game, okay?

16:55.753 --> 16:58.147
Do the meds actually help out with her...?

16:58.278 --> 17:04.501
It stabilizes her. There isn't really a lot ofanswers about curing dementia.

17:04.632 --> 17:10.551
Good news is, medical research gets
better every day. Nothing to worry about.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.248
Can I talk to you?

17:12.379 --> 17:14.859
Yeah.

17:14.990 --> 17:20.430
Hey, Louis. You okay
there, darling?

17:20.561 --> 17:25.740
Odis, where are you going? Our dance!

17:25.870 --> 17:45.934
We'll finish the dance when I get back.Two minutes... my darling!

17:46.065 --> 17:49.807
I don't get it. It's like one moment she can
remember me... Her son, Robert Wells.

17:49.938 --> 17:53.159
Then the next moment...

17:53.289 --> 17:57.250
It's like she's
there, and then she's not. I get it.

17:57.380 --> 18:03.604
All you've gotta do right nowis be patient.

18:03.734 --> 18:07.129
Lemme get a cigarette.

18:07.260 --> 18:24.494
C'mon! I can smell it all over that
cheap-ass cologne.

18:24.625 --> 18:31.501
Oo. Cancer.

18:31.632 --> 18:39.857
Look. I'm blind as a bat, but I have a nose
like a hound dog. Lemme guess, your

18:39.988 --> 18:42.382
girlfriend wants you to quit?

18:42.512 --> 18:45.950
Nah. My sister. She'd kill me if she
found out.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.778
That's why I only smoke one per day.

18:47.909 --> 18:54.959
No need to explain. So what type of
nurse are you?

18:55.090 --> 18:56.352
CNA.

18:56.483 --> 18:57.397
Pay good?

18:57.527 --> 18:59.660
$9/hour.

18:59.790 --> 19:26.774
Fuck me! You wiping wrinkled-ass butts for
pennies? No wonder you're stressed out.

19:26.904 --> 19:30.169
Hey, one of the nurses told me I could find-

19:30.299 --> 19:33.563
What're you doing here?

19:33.694 --> 19:44.183
I should be asking you that. Lena Johnson?

19:44.313 --> 19:50.232
Just when I thought I had you figured out.
Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.

19:50.363 --> 19:53.496
Just wanted to let you know that you don't
have to worry about feeding mother.

19:53.627 --> 20:08.642
I'm taking her out for a nice dine 'n dash.

20:08.772 --> 20:18.217
Oh boy. Boy.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.567
[knocking]

20:20.697 --> 20:25.963
Robert? Open the door, Robert.I know that you're in there.

20:26.094 --> 20:34.407
I can smell your stench way out here.

20:34.537 --> 20:35.886
Hello my friends.

20:36.017 --> 20:38.149
Who the fuck are you?

20:38.280 --> 20:44.373
Don't shoot! The name Asheek. I am just
the hotel manager. I mean- I am the owner

20:44.504 --> 20:47.768
the maid, bill-boy and security guard.

20:47.898 --> 20:52.338
Okay, slum dog, we got it. Now what do
you want?

20:52.468 --> 20:59.301
If you are in the process of asking Robert
for money, I would be most grateful if you

20:59.432 --> 21:09.529
would please ask him for the rent. He's 3
weeks behind! I can help you get in.

21:09.659 --> 21:12.401
Gimme that-

21:12.532 --> 21:16.927
Thank you for your contribution. Now evictyourself from the premises

21:17.058 --> 21:19.408
beore I do it for you.

21:19.539 --> 21:39.994
Tell Robert I will be back!

21:40.124 --> 21:43.432
Smells like a dead body in here.

21:43.563 --> 21:53.790
Find the fuckhead.

21:53.921 --> 21:58.491
Over here. Found the dead body smell.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.188
Oh, he's still alive.

22:00.319 --> 22:09.415
You are embarrassing yourself. Now getup before I make possum real.

22:09.545 --> 22:17.510
Haha.. Hey! I didn't hear you two come in!

22:17.640 --> 22:22.645
Hey, if I'd known you two were coming I'dhave gotten some beer, some eggs

22:22.776 --> 22:25.169
coffee, cake. I'll get you guys something...

22:25.300 --> 22:29.565
Some eggs? Tapwater?

22:29.696 --> 22:30.784
Sit.

22:30.914 --> 22:44.058
Okay.

22:44.188 --> 22:49.977
Robert. Do you know why we're here, Robert?

22:50.107 --> 23:01.118
Because you cannot go around making real
bets on football games with fake money.

23:01.249 --> 23:12.652
Where is our money, Robert?

23:12.782 --> 23:21.487
This is only $200, Robert. Where is the
other $3000?

23:21.617 --> 23:24.838
$3000? I'm only short $2500.

23:24.968 --> 23:32.106
The extra $500 is the convenience fee for
having us come to you for easy payment.

23:32.236 --> 23:36.850
Man, it's only been one day!-

23:36.980 --> 23:43.073
Oh, fuck...

23:43.204 --> 23:48.252
The agreement you made is that you would
pay a certain percentage every day until the

23:48.383 --> 23:55.216
amount was paid in full.

23:55.346 --> 23:57.523
$3000 big ones, huh?

23:57.653 --> 24:01.831
Yes. Now you're starting to understand.

24:01.962 --> 24:15.628
You just gotta give me a few weeks,
that's all I'm asking. 3 weeks tops.

24:15.758 --> 24:27.596
I am a religious man. I will give you 12
days. One for each apostle. Otherwise I

24:27.727 --> 24:31.557
will have to visit your mother in the
nursing home for her last supper.

24:31.687 --> 24:42.393
C'mon. Gimme 3 weeks man! 3 weeks!

24:42.524 --> 24:52.447
Y'know... Now that I think about it,12 days is more than generous.

24:52.578 --> 25:05.808
I hope you're late. That would please me.

25:05.939 --> 25:17.820
Get your life together. Sucker.

25:17.951 --> 25:38.145
Fuck.

25:38.275 --> 25:42.932
Now lemme see these. A tight grip.
Make sure your eyes is on the prize.

25:43.063 --> 25:49.243
There you go. Okay. Make thatstraight. You got this?

25:49.373 --> 25:52.072
Just like that.

25:52.202 --> 25:55.379
[Spanish speaking]

25:55.510 --> 25:56.293
That's not true.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.251
You got this?

25:57.381 --> 25:58.774
Like this, Uncle Dean?

25:58.905 --> 26:00.428
Yeah, there you go!

26:00.559 --> 26:02.952
No, butthead. What kind of Dominicandon't know how to play baseball?

26:03.083 --> 26:07.566
Ayy, McGill, c'mon man. We're not supposed
to be talking to each other like that.

26:07.696 --> 26:11.308
Y'all are supposed to be supporting each
other. You hear me? Say you're sorry.

26:11.439 --> 26:16.270
Sorry for calling you butthead. Buttnugget.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.533
C'mon man. Let's get this together.

26:18.664 --> 26:25.366
Alright now look. Give it to him, put a
little sauce on it, but not too much.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.324
You smell like cigarettes.

26:27.455 --> 26:39.946
I don't smoke no cigarettes. Look. I got
this dollar for you. C'mon, let's get it!

26:40.076 --> 26:42.818
There it is!

26:42.949 --> 26:46.387
See, look what I told you, man! You see?You see what happens when you

26:46.517 --> 26:48.476
listen to your uncle?

26:48.607 --> 26:57.137
Good job, man. Go get the ball.

26:57.267 --> 27:01.620
Damn.

27:01.750 --> 27:06.189
Only $267. I'm not even close. Wegotta find another hustle.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.628
We?

27:09.758 --> 27:12.761
Yes, we, shithead. You helped spend that
money and place those phony bets, too.

27:12.892 --> 27:15.546
So start thinking.

27:15.677 --> 27:20.943
Start thinking...? Well how many days
we got left?

27:21.074 --> 27:21.944
Ten.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.642
Ten? Ten?!

27:23.772 --> 27:27.994
Jesus. Only ten days? Ten days and wegotta fucking think of something

27:28.124 --> 27:30.344
fucking genius in ten days? The fuck happened?

27:30.474 --> 27:32.694
Alright, so what the fuck happened? Theycame into the door and be like

27:32.825 --> 27:38.047
'yo, gimme the fuckin' money and shit'?

27:38.178 --> 27:41.834
What the hell you doing takingClaudine Bowie meds for?

27:41.964 --> 27:45.402
Claudine Bowie? Claudine Bowieis my grandma, Bowie is my last name.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.449
Dude, we've been friends 5 years and youdon't even know my last name?

27:48.579 --> 27:55.369
We're business associates.

27:55.499 --> 27:57.588
You're my friend.

27:57.719 --> 28:00.591
So you're stealing your granny's meds?

28:00.722 --> 28:06.249
No, no no. I'm just using the bottle.
Putting my pills in there in case

28:06.380 --> 28:08.512
I get jammed up by the cops.

28:08.643 --> 28:12.038
That way it'll look like I'm running
errands and not coppin' my own fix.

28:12.168 --> 28:14.823
Eh? Smart.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.565
So you buying pills off the street?

28:17.696 --> 28:21.395
Of course! Hell yeah. It's faster andcheaper than going to the doc'

28:21.525 --> 28:23.614
plus I get anything my heart desires.

28:23.745 --> 28:28.750
The way I see it, the big farm plays by
their rules, why can't I play by mine?

28:28.881 --> 28:33.537
So your dealer. How much does he charge?

28:33.668 --> 28:38.151
Okay, well first of all, he prefersthe term "land pharmacist."

28:38.281 --> 28:43.591
Really depends on the milligram. 10...
20 a pop. He's got hydrocodone, oxy's

28:43.722 --> 28:46.899
uppers, downers, everythingbehind-the-counter at CVS.

28:47.029 --> 28:51.730
Also, he stays off the feds' radar.

28:51.860 --> 28:57.039
Smart.

28:57.170 --> 29:02.044
God damn. Hey, you've gotta be thedumbest, smartest idiot I know.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.524
Thanks?

29:03.654 --> 29:09.008
Man! I gotta go. Hey, lock upbefore you go.

29:09.138 --> 29:11.053
Cool. I'm gonna take a napbefore you come back.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.664
Y'know what, I change my mind.Get the fuck out.

29:13.795 --> 29:19.845
No! C'mon!

29:19.975 --> 29:23.544
Mr. Rogers. Here you go, heartbreaker.

29:23.674 --> 29:29.289
The term around here is heartstopper. It's
a one way exit out of this place for us.

29:29.419 --> 29:32.161
I'm just trying to spread a little love
around while I can.

29:32.292 --> 29:37.384
Don't spread too much love. You knowthere's a chlamydia outbreak.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.690
There you go.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.476
Yo, Robert. Your mother's right here.

29:42.606 --> 29:44.870
I'm not here for mother. Can Italk to you for a sec?

29:45.000 --> 29:48.656
Yeah, sure. Hey Phil! you mindwatching my post for a minute?

29:48.787 --> 29:52.486
Sure thing!

29:52.616 --> 29:57.447
Diego seems like a pretty nice guy. But my
boss and my scrotum must stay together.

29:57.578 --> 30:01.060
So I spent the next two days trying to
convince the little shit to see things my way.

30:01.190 --> 30:05.847
When that didn't work, naturally, I
blackmailed him. Robert Wells does nott

30:05.978 --> 30:10.330
take no for an answer.
Look, not in the kind of way you think.

30:10.460 --> 30:20.383
Alright, man, fuck you guys.

30:20.514 --> 30:24.083
I'm good, bro. What's up?What's on your mind?

30:24.213 --> 30:27.042
I found a way out for both of us.

30:27.173 --> 30:28.304
Out of what?

30:28.435 --> 30:31.568
Look. Are we both down on ourluck? Are we not?

30:31.699 --> 30:33.005
Man, speak for yourself.

30:33.135 --> 30:36.617
Cut the shit, man.

30:36.747 --> 30:40.664
Look, I owe money all over this place.And you're stuck at this place

30:40.795 --> 30:42.928
wiping asses for shit money. Literally.

30:43.058 --> 30:47.584
Now I have a plan that could change
all that.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.586
I'm listening.

30:49.717 --> 30:54.722
Pills. Plain ol' everyday common pills,man. I'm talking Perks, Xanex

30:54.853 --> 30:56.419
Vicodin, Viagra, you name it.

30:56.550 --> 30:59.553
This place has it!

30:59.683 --> 31:03.687
Hey. All you gotta do is supply theproduct. I will disperse of it.

31:03.818 --> 31:07.866
We can split it down the middle, 50/50.
What do you say?

31:07.996 --> 31:10.869
I say that you're crazy! you'retalking about a major felony.

31:10.999 --> 31:18.528
No shit it's a major felony. Man, do I
look like the type of guy who would be

31:18.659 --> 31:28.495
stuck selling HerbaLife products?
Look, kid. I have a plan that could

31:28.625 --> 31:34.544
take us out of this situation. Icould take care of all the heavy lifting.

31:34.675 --> 31:37.983
All you gotta do is supply the product.

31:38.113 --> 31:44.206
Nah, man, I'm good. I'm good.

31:44.337 --> 31:50.430
Look. We can either do this the easy
way, or the hard way.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.736
I'll go talk to your superiors,I know exactly what you did.

31:52.867 --> 32:07.708
Pshh. Do what you gotta do, bro.

32:07.838 --> 32:13.888
Hey, hey, hey. I don't think your mom's
feeling too good.

32:14.019 --> 32:18.893
Would you guys go down to the candy lady
and get you guys some few snacks. Alright?

32:19.024 --> 32:24.507
And after that why don't you guys practice
some catching and some batting. Alright?

32:24.638 --> 32:27.249
Hi, Diego.

32:27.380 --> 32:28.294
Hey!

32:28.424 --> 32:29.295
How was work?

32:29.425 --> 32:32.124
It was fine. How are you feeling?

32:32.254 --> 32:34.126
Not as bad as I look.

32:34.256 --> 32:43.265
[Spanish speaking]

32:43.396 --> 32:45.093
Ma. You been drinking?

32:45.224 --> 32:46.616
Jesus juice.

32:46.747 --> 32:52.100
[Spanish speaking]

32:52.231 --> 32:55.060
Mami, stop it.

32:55.190 --> 32:59.499
Danny. You think you could hold up on
those meds I got you for about a week?

32:59.629 --> 33:00.804
Mhm.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.415
You sure?

33:02.545 --> 33:05.287
I'm gonna finish this surgery thing
out, alright?

33:05.418 --> 33:07.420
In the meantime, just get better. Alright?

33:07.550 --> 34:01.474
I'm gonna go to my room. Make some
phone calls.

34:01.604 --> 34:08.785
Yeah, it's Diego. Where can I meet you?

34:08.916 --> 34:24.540
Okay. Cool. I'll be there.

34:24.671 --> 34:29.719
What's up man?

34:29.850 --> 34:30.590
You came alone, right?

34:30.720 --> 34:35.464
Yeah.

34:35.595 --> 34:38.902
God damn door.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.122
So what's the plan?

34:41.253 --> 34:45.692
Here you go. Here's everything youneed. Get as much as you can

34:45.822 --> 34:49.304
and in the meantime I'll help us find a
bigger connect as our profits grow.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.480
I can't even believe I'm doin' this shit.

34:51.611 --> 34:53.830
Hey, you're doing the right thing.
It's only temporary.

34:53.961 --> 34:57.660
There's only one more thing. Weneed to beef up our sales force.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.880
How we gonna do that?

35:00.010 --> 35:03.579
We need a nice piece of ass to help
sell with us.

35:03.710 --> 35:06.626
What the hell do we look like, two dudes
selling dick pills to other dudes?

35:06.756 --> 35:09.368
Hey. Dick pills are very lucrative.

35:09.498 --> 35:13.807
Well what woman in their right mind is
gonna go do that?

35:13.937 --> 35:19.421
I know a chick. Get in.

35:19.552 --> 35:55.588
Come this way. Get in. Get in.

35:55.718 --> 36:01.115
So. Why do you wanna finish school
so bad anyway?

36:01.246 --> 36:06.773
I dunno, I'm with you, but it seems like a
lot of red tape to go through it.

36:06.903 --> 36:13.171
Yeah I guess. I mean, I dunno. No one else
in my family has ever graduated before.

36:13.301 --> 36:18.176
Oh, so you wanna be a pioneer.Makes sense.

36:18.306 --> 36:21.962
Hey, I was the first girl in my family
to be in teen pregnancy!

36:22.092 --> 36:23.920
Oh, congrats.

36:24.051 --> 36:25.574
Milestones are a good thing!

36:25.705 --> 36:30.710
Yeah, sure, but I mean.. that's a bitdifferent, don't you think?

36:30.840 --> 36:40.067
Just a bit.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.547
The nerve of that guy.

36:41.677 --> 36:43.375
What?

36:43.505 --> 36:47.422
I just counted the fake money that prickfrom the other day gave me.

36:47.553 --> 36:50.077
Who counterfeits a $5 bill?

36:50.208 --> 36:52.645
What? How'd you know it's fake?

36:52.775 --> 37:01.828
Donna. George Washington ain't
on a $5 bill.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.917
Oh shit.

37:04.047 --> 37:11.011
Yeah, Jesus. He's probably rotting in
some jail or ditch by now, anyway.

37:11.141 --> 37:15.102
Well, I surely hope so. He stole my
tip on his way out, too.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.930
Serious?

37:17.060 --> 37:22.065
Yeah. I'm very serious.

37:22.196 --> 37:34.600
Oh, speak of the devil.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.254
Hey!

37:36.384 --> 37:37.429
Hey!

37:37.559 --> 37:39.169
This right here is my friend.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.433
Oh, hi! Out, out.

37:41.563 --> 37:44.305
What? What, are you crazy, man?

37:44.436 --> 37:47.613
What, do you think you can fuckaround with people's tips?

37:47.743 --> 37:50.442
Listen, you and your friend needto get out of here. Asshole.

37:50.572 --> 37:56.186
Wait, wait, wait. Before you do something
like that, I got something for you.

37:56.317 --> 38:06.501
Yeah. It's real, too. For your troubles.You can check it yourselves.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.590
Mhm.

38:08.721 --> 38:11.854
Alright, it's real. So what's going on?

38:11.985 --> 38:21.081
Well, that's why we're here. We onlyneed five minutes of your time.

38:21.211 --> 38:25.651
Fine. Five minutes. I'll get the coffee.

38:25.781 --> 38:29.959
I'll get some chairs.

38:30.090 --> 38:31.874
You're right man, she could definitely
sell our dick pills.

38:32.005 --> 38:39.055
I told you.

38:39.186 --> 38:43.277
Man, it's a thousand percent return
on investment.

38:43.408 --> 38:48.282
Plus, Dr. Quinn Medicine-Woman over
here will be supplying meds on his break.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.502
So Viagra?

38:50.632 --> 38:54.767
Not just Viagra. We want to be a one-stop
shop for everything pharmaceutical.

38:54.897 --> 38:58.423
But, we want you to head up thedick pill department.

38:58.553 --> 39:00.555
Yeah, there's a lot of money in dick pills.

39:00.686 --> 39:02.688
Stop calling them dick pills.

39:02.818 --> 39:05.778
Fine, penis enhancers. Point is, when it
comes to selling these

39:05.908 --> 39:07.997
things, you're a natural.

39:08.128 --> 39:09.869
So what's our cut?

39:09.999 --> 39:13.133
Our? Listen, no offense, but I'm only
interested in the tits with the least

39:13.263 --> 39:16.223
amount of mileage on them.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.051
You wish you drove this.

39:18.181 --> 39:22.403
Hold on.

39:22.534 --> 39:25.667
Listen. I don't know about this.

39:25.798 --> 39:29.584
I know, but.. it sounds good.Good business...

39:29.715 --> 39:31.151
It does not sound like good business.

39:31.281 --> 39:35.982
Okay, bad business, good money.Think college money. C'mon.

39:36.112 --> 39:40.334
Okay.

39:40.465 --> 39:41.988
You can't get me without Donna.

39:42.118 --> 39:44.947
God dammit. Hold up.

39:45.078 --> 39:47.123
Diego. We're really not trying to
split this two ways.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.735
She's our Lebron James. Shegot a little leverage.

39:49.865 --> 39:52.781
I know, but I'm not trying to goover salary count.

39:52.912 --> 39:56.829
Look. In this case, we kinda have to.
Got no choice.

39:56.959 --> 39:59.875
Fine.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.574
Deal.

40:02.704 --> 41:13.514

Great first day. Man.

41:44.066 --> 41:45.067
Karen?

41:45.198 --> 41:46.112
Yeah?

41:46.242 --> 41:47.417
You need a ride?

41:47.548 --> 41:48.941
No, I'll just catch a cab.

41:49.071 --> 41:51.944
Hold on. Why don't I just give you a ride?

41:52.074 --> 41:53.946
Yeah, okay.

41:54.076 --> 41:57.558
Okay. You two be safe!

41:57.689 --> 42:00.039
Hey. Yo. You riding with me?

42:00.169 --> 42:33.507
Hell no. I'm gonna walk, dude. I got
two feet. They move.

42:33.638 --> 42:34.769
C'mon.

42:34.900 --> 42:39.600
Nice car.

42:39.731 --> 42:44.257
I didn't mean any disrespect, you just don't
seem like the getting your hands too dirty type.

42:44.387 --> 42:49.523
Yeah, but c'mon though. Do any of us
really seem the type?

42:49.654 --> 42:53.919
Except Robert, of course.

42:54.049 --> 42:55.616
So what do you do?

42:55.747 --> 42:57.487
I'm in school.

42:57.618 --> 43:00.403
What do you study?

43:00.534 --> 43:04.320
Aerospace engineering. So I'll become a...

43:04.451 --> 43:07.019
A rocket scientist.

43:07.149 --> 43:09.412
Impressive.

43:09.543 --> 43:13.416
I'm not the only one that knows a little
something. I have a CNA license you know.

43:13.547 --> 43:15.201
Okay.

43:15.331 --> 43:19.771
Hopefully I'll go back to school sometime,
get a degree. Finish up.

43:19.901 --> 43:24.819
So Dr. Diego, huh? Has a nice ring to it.

43:24.950 --> 43:28.910
As long as my family is taken care of,that's all that matters to me.

43:29.041 --> 43:36.135
Call me whatever you want, honestly.Dr. Diego Alvarez. I like that.

43:36.265 --> 43:39.399
Wait, so, Diego Alvarez. So you're Latino?

43:39.529 --> 43:43.882
Well yeah. And black, obviously. Black is
more of a race. Hispanic and Dominican

43:44.012 --> 43:53.935
is more of my nationality and culture.

43:54.066 --> 44:02.901
So how'd you end up here? Like, with us?
Doing all this.

44:03.031 --> 44:10.778
Y'know, sometimes life has this awful way
of putting you in a position where if...

44:10.909 --> 44:19.047
If you find the opportunity to help your-
self, whether it be good or bad, you take it.

44:19.178 --> 44:30.319
I feel you.

44:30.450 --> 44:34.933
Hey, there's the man.

44:35.063 --> 44:36.456
Still trying to live the glory days, huh?

44:36.586 --> 44:37.849
I still got it.

44:37.979 --> 44:39.807
Ah, whatever. Hey, I appreciate you
though.

44:39.938 --> 44:43.550
Hey. Anything for the best wide receive
quarterback duo in the country, though.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.378
Next to you, I'll pass my midterms now.

44:45.508 --> 44:47.685
How's classes comin'?

44:47.815 --> 44:52.211
Not too good, man. I mean, everybody's
kinda been on edge since Mayor Santos died.

44:52.341 --> 44:54.822
They just left his body laying right
outside our campus.

44:54.953 --> 44:56.519
That's horrible.

44:56.650 --> 45:00.828
Hey, if you ran for mayor, everybody onthis campus would vote for you.

45:00.959 --> 45:05.615
Hey. I'm a man for the people. Even if you
two fuckers did lose my money last week.

45:05.746 --> 45:07.661
30 and 15 and you run the ball?

45:07.792 --> 45:09.445
Hey man, we don't make the calls.

45:09.576 --> 45:13.014
You got a point. Well tell your coach
to drop dead, okay?

45:13.145 --> 45:15.147
Hey, get my man Marcus the ball more.

45:15.277 --> 45:16.801
I tried!

45:16.931 --> 45:18.367
I'll catch y'all cats later.

45:18.498 --> 45:19.238
Stay black.

45:19.368 --> 45:20.761
Hey man, tell him about the party.

45:20.892 --> 45:28.334
Yo, Rob! I think I might have abusiness opportunity for you.

45:28.464 --> 45:32.991
Say no more.

45:33.121 --> 45:34.166
Anything?

45:34.296 --> 45:35.863
Nothing.

45:35.994 --> 45:40.346
Two Viagra a day for two straight weeks,and I'm as soft as a Twinkie.

45:40.476 --> 45:45.699
Aw. Close your eyes, give me your hands.

45:45.830 --> 45:46.831
Why?

45:46.961 --> 46:01.367
Just do it.

46:01.497 --> 46:02.760
How'd you do that?

46:02.890 --> 46:06.589
Aw. Be sure to tell a friend.

46:06.720 --> 46:09.331
Now I gotta go relieve myself.

46:09.462 --> 46:16.295
Aw, go.

46:16.425 --> 46:20.168
Okay. It's okay. Just remember, one pilla day with cranberry juice.

46:20.299 --> 46:21.996
Okay.

46:22.127 --> 46:25.826
Okay? And no blogging or romantic comedy
movies. Those get you too worked up.

46:25.957 --> 46:38.186
Okay? Sounds good.

46:38.317 --> 46:44.714
Deep, deep breaths. There you go, justbreathe. Look. I got some Xanex

46:44.845 --> 46:46.107

46:51.069 --> 46:57.423
True! Lemme see what you got, man.

yourself.

47:18.531 --> 47:20.794

47:20.925 --> 47:24.276
Look. You got chronic back pain that'll
lead to migraines

47:24.406 --> 47:28.236
and all kinds of fucked up shit. Now,
I'm giving you the stuff that doctors

47:28.367 --> 47:32.588
won't prescribe. Take it or leave it.

47:32.719 --> 47:37.419
Can't believe this.

47:37.550 --> 47:40.945
Thank you.

47:41.075 --> 47:43.469
At least do my back for an extra 20.

47:43.599 --> 47:50.606

48:16.110 --> 48:17.459

48:17.590 --> 48:19.244
Well tell your husband to chill the fuck
out on that rent.

48:19.374 --> 48:20.854
Okay, look. I'll talk to him.

Stickin' it in your ass. Hahaha.

48:26.686 --> 48:30.211
Tell the motherfucker I will kill him!
He was supposed to sell me Viagra.

48:30.342 --> 48:33.214
And he sold me Valium! My dick was
supposed to go like this

48:33.345 --> 48:34.476
and it went like this!

48:34.607 --> 48:35.347
Why is that?

I don't know!

Hey. Thank you for helping mepick those clothes up.

49:10.251 --> 49:15.822
Yeah, yeah. It was a lot of fun. Y'know my
niece is already in middle school so

49:15.953 --> 49:19.304
There's no little ones for me to shop
for anymore.

49:19.434 --> 49:21.480
That's cool.

49:21.610 --> 49:24.222
So what's your story?

Well, I know you need money, butwhat about you?

49:29.705 --> 49:31.664
What does Diego want?

49:31.794 --> 49:36.408
Honestly, it's always been about my family.I mean, college really wasn't

49:36.538 --> 49:37.844
an option for me.

49:37.975 --> 49:45.591
Okay, yeah, but I mean like... Okay.
What was your dream?

49:45.721 --> 49:47.593
My dream?

49:47.723 --> 49:50.074
I mean, I always wanted to coachpro baseball.

49:50.204 --> 49:51.989
Really?

49:52.119 --> 49:56.994
Yeah. I was never a player myself, but...I just liked watching it.

49:57.124 --> 49:59.083
I always understood the game.

49:59.213 --> 50:06.003
Okay, okay. Dr. Diego. And also Uncle
Diego. And Coach Diego.

50:06.133 --> 50:07.961
Is there anything you don't do?

50:08.092 --> 50:10.572
I don't speak Spanish anymore.

50:10.703 --> 50:13.836
What? What do you mean you don't speak
Spanish anymore?

50:13.967 --> 50:19.538
I mean, ever since my mom sent me
off to boarding school when I was young

50:19.668 --> 50:26.806
I just never could really understand it
anymore.

50:26.936 --> 50:28.808
Do you regret it?

50:28.938 --> 50:39.471
Not really. I mean, I kinda, y'know.
Just balance. I get it from them.

50:39.601 --> 50:44.998
So life isn't tough at home? With you not
being able to speak it with everybody else?

50:45.129 --> 50:49.742
There's a couple jokes here and there thatI don't get, but, y'know.

50:49.872 --> 50:53.702
I don't let it get to me. Me and my sister
communicate with her so that's really

50:53.833 --> 50:55.139
all that matters.

50:55.269 --> 50:56.618
You're close with your sister, aren't you?

50:56.749 --> 50:59.752
Very. That's like my pride and joy.

50:59.882 --> 51:06.541
Yeah. I didn't have a sister, but I always
had Donna. She always rooted for me.

51:06.672 --> 51:09.153
That's good. It's good to have somebody
like that.

51:09.283 --> 51:14.680

each other.

Wet or dry.

53:17.019 --> 53:19.021

Good man, good. Making money.

55:32.851 --> 55:36.811

business we should really know the product

55:36.942 --> 55:38.987
we're selling.

55:39.118 --> 55:44.036
Nah, man. C'mon, bro. Drug free. I'm solid.

Don't worry about it. It's cool.

55:59.573 --> 56:03.229
C'mon, let's take a drink.

56:03.360 --> 56:06.972
Alright, have fun.

56:07.102 --> 56:46.185
[party music]

56:46.315 --> 56:50.494
So um... how do we know this jackass isn'tgonna screw us out of our cut.

56:50.624 --> 56:53.235
He's been clutching that bag all night.

56:53.366 --> 56:55.020
She does have a point.

56:55.150 --> 57:06.248
Look, guys, don't even worry about it.
I'll take care of it. I got this.

57:06.379 --> 57:11.950
One upper, one downer.

57:12.080 --> 57:20.349
Hey, Rob! C'mere.

57:20.480 --> 57:27.139
Yo, Robert! Excuse me ladies. What's up
man, how you feeling?

57:27.269 --> 57:29.097
Alright, how you feeling?

57:29.228 --> 57:33.058
I'm great. Look, I'm always hearing about
those stories back in the day of how you

57:33.188 --> 57:36.496
were chugging shots. Look, don't just be
about it, lemme see!

57:36.627 --> 57:38.455
Nah...

57:38.585 --> 57:44.722
Aw, c'mon. We like to see that, right ladies?
We'd like to see that. C'mon man.

57:44.852 --> 57:49.335
There you go. Stepping up.

57:49.466 --> 57:55.907
All the way! Straight shot!There you go!

57:56.037 --> 58:00.172
I'll take this man, don't hurt yourself.

58:00.302 --> 58:52.703
[party music]

58:52.833 --> 59:03.061
He died. He died next to me. My hamster!I swear. I never got to him!

59:03.191 --> 59:08.936
I had the best threesome of my life!
Oh my God!

59:09.067 --> 59:13.724
Yeah. Yeah, I got a new hamster. I don't
know where it came from but I got

59:13.854 --> 59:15.421
a new hamster!

59:15.552 --> 59:19.599
Lemme just get another drink.

59:19.730 --> 59:26.606
I don't know what his name was! He was like
grey, and had a little spot on him.

59:26.737 --> 59:37.617
He was a hamster.

59:37.748 --> 59:44.189
Another one.

59:44.319 --> 59:46.321
Boss.

59:46.452 --> 59:50.369
Gentlemen. All the debtors have their funds
in order?

59:50.499 --> 59:53.024
We got one left, boss, Robert.

59:53.154 --> 59:58.116
Again. That son of a bitch owes more than
the federal government.

59:58.246 --> 1:00:01.728
He said he'd have the cash paid in full
by the weekend.

1:00:01.859 --> 1:00:07.038
Good, good good. Okay, I have another
assignment for you. Word is, there's a new

1:00:07.168 --> 1:00:12.652
dealer on my turf not paying their taxes.
Find him.

1:00:12.783 --> 1:00:20.094
Yes sir.

1:00:20.225 --> 1:00:25.578
This right here is a street pharmacist's
worst nightmare.

1:00:25.709 --> 1:00:27.841
First off, I want to apologize for last
night. I don't know what the hell

1:00:27.972 --> 1:00:28.886
got over me.

1:00:29.016 --> 1:00:31.628
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's just see the cash.

1:00:31.758 --> 1:00:36.371
Okay.

1:00:36.502 --> 1:00:38.765
This.

1:00:38.896 --> 1:00:40.375
Oh God!

1:00:40.506 --> 1:00:43.422
This is what teamwork looks like.

1:00:43.552 --> 1:00:47.034
This is four days. Four days.

1:00:47.165 --> 1:00:49.689
Yeah!

1:00:49.820 --> 1:00:54.738
You guys ready for those cuts?

1:00:54.868 --> 1:00:56.565
One for you, Karen.

1:00:56.696 --> 1:00:58.872
Thank you!

1:00:59.003 --> 1:01:04.095
Oh my God. One more week of this and I'llhave everything paid off.

1:01:04.225 --> 1:01:08.447
And one for you.

1:01:08.577 --> 1:01:14.801
Gimme. Damn girl, another week of this
and you'll be able to own that college.

1:01:14.932 --> 1:01:16.760
One for you.

1:01:16.890 --> 1:01:19.153
Oh, you're a gentleman. Too kind man.

1:01:19.284 --> 1:01:27.858
Y'know what? This is for me, man.You keep giving away free shit.

1:01:27.988 --> 1:01:29.903
I only got 40 bucks, man.

1:01:30.034 --> 1:01:33.254
Yeah. You gave away about 2-3000 man.

1:01:33.385 --> 1:01:37.215
Well how else am I gonna get laid?

1:01:37.345 --> 1:01:42.350
This. That's what I'm talking about, man.

1:01:42.481 --> 1:01:44.309
Good job.

1:01:44.439 --> 1:01:50.619
I knew you was always trustworthy man.
Don't let me down.

1:01:50.750 --> 1:01:55.102
This is for me.

1:01:55.233 --> 1:02:02.501
[laughing]

1:02:02.631 --> 1:02:06.461
Diego. Thanks for tonight, man.

1:02:06.592 --> 1:02:08.594
No problem, man. What's the point ofmoney if you don't have friends

1:02:08.725 --> 1:02:09.856
to spend it on.

1:02:09.987 --> 1:02:10.988
Respect, respect.

1:02:11.118 --> 1:02:15.079
Woah, woah. You good, bro?

1:02:15.209 --> 1:02:20.562
Never seen you like this, man.Get it together, man.

1:02:20.693 --> 1:02:32.270
40 hours a week of wiping senior citizen
asses. You wipe em... you need a drink.

1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:37.666
You know Mayor Santos was gonna raise the
minimum wage for guys like us, but...

1:02:37.797 --> 1:02:42.236
You go with this conspiracy crap, you for
sure need a drink.

1:02:42.367 --> 1:02:46.588
You need scotch! This is what, whiskey?

1:02:46.719 --> 1:02:48.286
It's hurting my stomach, man.

1:02:48.416 --> 1:02:52.029
Didn't even know you were a scotch man!

1:02:52.159 --> 1:02:57.817
I drink scotch when I can. I drink whiskey
because I have to.

1:02:57.948 --> 1:02:59.601
I mean at 12.50 an hour, that's all I can afford.

1:02:59.732 --> 1:03:02.082
Wait, you make 12.50 an hour?

1:03:02.213 --> 1:03:03.562
Sadly, yes.

1:03:03.692 --> 1:03:05.825
I'll be damned.

1:03:05.956 --> 1:03:12.701
You can be damned about this, fool.

1:03:12.832 --> 1:03:15.226
I'll cut your filthy soul!

1:03:15.356 --> 1:03:18.620
Shh! Deal! The boys are trying to sleep
in the back!

1:03:18.751 --> 1:03:21.275
It's mother! She's just beenbringing this new guy around, and...

1:03:21.406 --> 1:03:23.364
Shh!

1:03:23.495 --> 1:03:27.934
You're right. Work related problems only.
I'm srory.

1:03:28.065 --> 1:03:30.981
This is a wrap. You guys gotta go home.

1:03:31.111 --> 1:03:34.985
I'm out man. This is too much.

1:03:35.115 --> 1:03:39.990
I'm ready to go home with all this money.
I'm tired of this dude.

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:50.217
Get it together, man.

1:03:50.348 --> 1:03:55.875
Mrs. Wells, this tea is absolutely delightful.

1:03:56.006 --> 1:03:59.357
Yes, splendid. Really.

1:03:59.487 --> 1:04:07.365
Cindy, I love you. I should've poisoned
you a long time ago you evil bitch.

1:04:07.495 --> 1:04:10.890
I know you slept with my husband, and
Matthew Brown!

1:04:11.021 --> 1:04:17.114
Mom, it's me! It's Rob! It's Rob!

1:04:17.244 --> 1:04:19.464
Hey bud!

1:04:19.594 --> 1:04:22.249
Shit, you scared me.

1:04:22.380 --> 1:04:24.599
Sorry. You okay?

1:04:24.730 --> 1:04:26.079
Yeah, I'm fine. Did you need something?

1:04:26.210 --> 1:04:29.517
No.

1:04:29.648 --> 1:04:34.871
Hey Diego. Prescription drugs have been
coming up short lately. have you seen

1:04:35.001 --> 1:04:36.220
anything suspicious around here?

1:04:36.350 --> 1:04:37.308
No.

1:04:37.438 --> 1:04:38.526
You sure?

1:04:38.657 --> 1:04:40.267
Yeah. Yes ma'am.

1:04:40.398 --> 1:04:41.834
Okay, well you let me know if you do.

1:04:41.965 --> 1:05:01.071
Will do.

1:05:01.201 --> 1:05:05.553
[choking]

1:05:05.684 --> 1:05:10.994
Yeah, sure. Pretend you can't breathe
before I retaliate!

1:05:11.124 --> 1:05:13.605
That's such a Louis move.

1:05:13.735 --> 1:05:21.352
[choking]

1:05:21.482 --> 1:05:36.062
Help! Help!

1:05:36.193 --> 1:05:38.630
I told you, I don't know anything.

1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:42.503
You can do whatever the fuck you want to
at this school. You're trying to tell me

1:05:42.634 --> 1:05:43.896
you don't know who the new dealer is?

1:05:44.027 --> 1:05:51.208
I'm telling the truth.

1:05:51.338 --> 1:05:57.866
Okay. Okay. Kenny? Knife please?

1:05:57.997 --> 1:06:00.173
Knife? What the- that's not a knife?

1:06:00.304 --> 1:06:05.962
Oh, no. We're Game of Thrones fans.

1:06:06.092 --> 1:06:18.887
Now... I saw your game last week.
15 catches... 238 yards. 3 touchdowns.

1:06:19.018 --> 1:06:28.114
Oh, very impressive! But you know what
would be more impressive? Seeing you

1:06:28.245 --> 1:06:32.292
do it without any arms.

1:06:32.423 --> 1:06:35.208
I'll tell you! Shit, stop. I'll tell you.

1:06:35.339 --> 1:06:45.479
Yes, yes kitten. You will.

1:06:45.610 --> 1:06:46.263
Diego.

1:06:46.393 --> 1:06:48.091
Yeah?

1:06:48.221 --> 1:06:49.570
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1:06:49.701 --> 1:06:52.443
Why?

1:06:52.573 --> 1:06:55.837
Cuz you've been acting differently, man.
I don't get it.

1:06:55.968 --> 1:06:59.624
I saw you lying to Rhonda's face.
And you always complained about being

1:06:59.754 --> 1:07:02.148
broke and all the sudden you can buy the
department drinks?

1:07:02.279 --> 1:07:04.977
Bro. Why don't you mind your own business.

1:07:05.108 --> 1:07:08.285
Cut the shit! Our prescription drugs go
missing and suddenly you won the lottery?

1:07:08.415 --> 1:07:26.868
Bullshit, Diego. Bull shit! This ain't you,
man.

1:07:26.999 --> 1:07:30.959
I just want to let everybody know I'm
officially out. I got enough money saved

1:07:31.090 --> 1:07:34.137
up, I can pay off all my debt and moveMrs. Wells to a new home!

1:07:34.267 --> 1:07:36.182
Quit?

1:07:36.313 --> 1:07:40.317
Yeah, I'm quittin' while I'm ahead.

1:07:40.447 --> 1:07:45.626
Yeah, I'm out too. I mean hell, I made
enough to go on my booze trip around the

1:07:45.757 --> 1:07:51.502
Caribean, so. Why risk it?

1:07:51.632 --> 1:07:53.373
Karen?

1:07:53.504 --> 1:07:57.421
Look, I'm sorry. I've made enough to pay
off tuition for this semester. And even

1:07:57.551 --> 1:07:58.770
get books for next-

1:07:58.900 --> 1:08:03.818
So this is it? Just like that! Everything
is done?

1:08:03.949 --> 1:08:06.082
Look, Diego, alright-

1:08:06.212 --> 1:08:09.911
No, man! All you guys got what you wanted!
Now I go back to this fucking $9 an hour

1:08:10.042 --> 1:08:16.831
job and bills I can't even afford! Man, I
have a family that depends on me.

1:08:16.962 --> 1:08:19.399
You guys know this...

1:08:19.530 --> 1:08:21.923
Even you said it for yourself. Your family
is getting suspicious.

1:08:22.054 --> 1:08:28.843
So? We're not the only dealers on the block!We can find another connect!

1:08:28.974 --> 1:08:33.979
Well I do know one guy that went to myschool, and he slings just about

1:08:34.110 --> 1:08:35.807
everything in Korea Town.

1:08:35.937 --> 1:08:39.115
Call him up! Call him up.

1:08:39.245 --> 1:08:48.428
Look. I don't know what y'all got planned,I don't have a choice. I don't.

1:08:48.559 --> 1:09:04.314
You know what? Hold on.
Take it.

1:09:04.444 --> 1:09:06.881
What's this?

1:09:07.012 --> 1:09:35.432
It's the money I saved up for the team.
But now it's yours.

1:09:35.562 --> 1:09:37.303
Boys.

1:09:37.434 --> 1:09:39.871
Dad?

1:09:40.001 --> 1:09:42.352
What's up baby.

1:09:42.482 --> 1:09:48.836
Hands up. Hands up.
I miss you.

1:09:48.967 --> 1:09:50.708
Who bought you these clothes?

1:09:50.838 --> 1:09:53.754
Uncle Diego and his girlfriend.Aren't they cool?

1:09:53.885 --> 1:09:57.497
Uncle Diego?

1:09:57.628 --> 1:09:59.499
Mhm. And his girlfriend.

1:09:59.630 --> 1:10:02.981
I like that. So what's up?How you doing?

1:10:03.111 --> 1:10:09.161
Good.

1:10:09.292 --> 1:10:10.902
Hey. You looking for a boyfriend?

1:10:11.032 --> 1:10:12.295
I already have one.

1:10:12.425 --> 1:10:14.297
Okay, well boyfriends are just speedbumps.

1:10:14.427 --> 1:10:15.820
They're slowing me down from getting to my
destination.

1:10:15.950 --> 1:10:17.952
Fuck off.

1:10:18.083 --> 1:10:23.131
What, wait, c'mon-

1:10:23.262 --> 1:10:25.090
Wes, Wes, Wes.

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:27.048
No, you did not just see that...

1:10:27.179 --> 1:10:29.094
You never did have a way with words.
I'll say that.

1:10:29.225 --> 1:10:30.356
What's up Karen.

1:10:30.487 --> 1:10:31.705
Not much.

1:10:31.836 --> 1:10:33.925
Is this Diego right here? My newbusiness associate?

1:10:34.055 --> 1:10:36.884
What's going on man, how you doing.

1:10:37.015 --> 1:10:39.017
I don't know if I'm a Jamaican right there.

1:10:39.147 --> 1:10:42.760
You know what's up man? You like where
I do my business?

1:10:42.890 --> 1:10:44.327
It's cool, dude.

1:10:44.457 --> 1:10:46.285
Can't get caught with the kids around right?
Know what I mean?

1:10:46.416 --> 1:11:34.725
I've got some pizza coming if you guys are
hungry, too. Cheese, I'm a vegetarian.

1:11:34.855 --> 1:11:36.814
Who are they?

1:11:36.944 --> 1:11:40.774
Just some chicks that work at a diner andsome guy that rolls with them.

1:11:40.905 --> 1:11:43.342
Doesn't really make much sense, but we'll
keep following them.

1:11:43.473 --> 1:11:59.793
You know what to do. Find the connect.

1:11:59.924 --> 1:12:01.926
What's good, my G.

1:12:02.056 --> 1:12:03.884
What's up boy.

1:12:04.015 --> 1:12:06.539
I heard you're the king of the hill now.
What's happening.

1:12:06.670 --> 1:12:08.324
You don't know shit.

1:12:08.454 --> 1:12:10.804
Oh, okay, don't act dumb. Don't play me
like that, I know what's going on.

1:12:10.935 --> 1:12:13.807
Feel me? I know what's going on.

1:12:13.938 --> 1:12:19.160
Man, you can't even take care of your own
fucking kids bro. Don't ever come up to me

1:12:19.291 --> 1:12:20.597

1:12:20.727 --> 1:12:22.947

1:12:46.274 --> 1:12:48.712
Fellas gettin' a little money wanna talk

1:12:48.842 --> 1:12:56.633

1:12:56.763 --> 1:13:01.420
[phone ringing]

1:13:01.551 --> 1:13:03.161
Babe, I gotta go.

1:13:03.291 --> 1:13:04.858
Why, what's up?

1:13:04.989 --> 1:13:08.079
I just promised Ben I'd meet up about
this money.

1:13:08.209 --> 1:13:12.605
Ben? Ben as in dead-beat dad of your
nephews, Ben?

1:13:12.736 --> 1:13:16.435
I'm not tryna deal with this right now, I
have other responsibilities other than

1:13:16.566 --> 1:13:18.437
myself right now, you know.

1:13:18.568 --> 1:13:20.831
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1:13:20.961 --> 1:13:23.007
Karen, I didn't-

1:13:23.137 --> 1:13:30.406
No, no, you did. Forget it. Go do what
you gotta do, cuz I'm done. I don't even

1:13:30.536 --> 1:13:44.768
know who you are anymore.

1:13:44.898 --> 1:13:48.032
Look, man, I don't even know what you're
talking about. You don't want your cut? Walk.

1:13:48.162 --> 1:13:49.642
You know why I came.

1:13:49.773 --> 1:13:53.907
Listen bro, calm down, bro. Listen to me
bro. Trust me bro.

1:13:54.038 --> 1:13:55.822
What's up man.

1:13:55.953 --> 1:13:59.130
What's happening? You sick or something?

1:13:59.260 --> 1:14:01.785
No, you know what's up. Who's this?

1:14:01.915 --> 1:14:05.832
I don't know him. Ain't fucking with this,
bro. We should move.

1:14:05.963 --> 1:14:07.965
He with me, G. He good. Everything is
straight.

1:14:08.095 --> 1:14:08.879
No.

1:14:09.009 --> 1:14:10.707
We're a team.

1:14:10.837 --> 1:14:13.623
I told you already. I ain't walking out on
my cut, man. Walk.

1:14:13.753 --> 1:14:15.451
Hey man, you got the stuff, man, but-

1:14:15.581 --> 1:14:16.713
Look man, you can talk to me.

1:14:16.843 --> 1:14:17.975
Talk to me.

1:14:18.105 --> 1:14:21.500
Look at him. We ain't wasting time here.

1:14:21.631 --> 1:14:23.850
You got the cash?

1:14:23.981 --> 1:14:25.243
Right here.

1:14:25.373 --> 1:14:28.159
Bro. I'm telling you, bro.

1:14:28.289 --> 1:14:33.207
Walk. Walk.

1:14:33.338 --> 1:14:35.775
Look, man. You got the cash?

1:14:35.906 --> 1:14:43.304
You got the pills?

1:14:43.435 --> 1:14:46.003
You're under arrest.

1:14:46.133 --> 1:14:49.354
Hey, hey.

1:14:49.485 --> 1:14:51.312
You got the right to remain silent.

1:14:51.443 --> 1:14:54.664
I knew your little punk ass was gonna go
for the money. You threw it all away, you

1:14:54.794 --> 1:14:56.840
little street punks.

1:14:56.970 --> 1:15:06.502
This is it, buddy. It's a wrap. Let's go.

1:15:06.632 --> 1:15:13.683
[phone ringing]

1:15:13.813 --> 1:15:15.380
Hello?

1:15:15.511 --> 1:15:20.254
Diego.

1:15:20.385 --> 1:15:22.430
What? Jail?

1:15:22.561 --> 1:15:26.913
Fuck. Okay. Hold tight, hold tight.

1:15:27.044 --> 1:15:27.958
[clearing throat]

1:15:28.088 --> 1:15:34.442
Don't- listen, don't talk to anyone. Okay.

1:15:34.573 --> 1:15:39.099
Nothing, man, I'm frustrated.

1:15:39.230 --> 1:15:46.977
Alright. Take care. Yes, yes.

1:15:47.107 --> 1:15:48.587
Shit.

1:15:48.718 --> 1:15:49.675
Ice cream?

1:15:49.806 --> 1:15:53.287
Let's do it.

1:15:53.418 --> 1:15:55.289
[door knocking]

1:15:55.420 --> 1:16:00.643
Should we?

1:16:00.773 --> 1:16:02.601
Dad?

1:16:02.732 --> 1:16:06.213
Hey, my boys! What's up, how you doing?

1:16:06.344 --> 1:16:07.563
Who's home?

1:16:07.693 --> 1:16:09.826
Grandma, but she's sleeping.

1:16:09.956 --> 1:16:29.193
Okay. Go, go.

1:16:29.323 --> 1:16:32.936
Boys. Who said you could have ice cream so early?

1:16:33.066 --> 1:16:34.241
Hey.

1:16:34.372 --> 1:16:37.723
Ben. Ben, no. I need you out.

1:16:37.854 --> 1:16:39.203
Look, you gotta listen. Diego is in trouble.

1:16:39.333 --> 1:16:40.639
Hey.

1:16:40.770 --> 1:16:41.640
Who the hell are you?

1:16:41.771 --> 1:16:43.250
He's the reason Diego is in trouble.

1:16:43.381 --> 1:16:45.905
Look, look. Oh, c'mon. Stop it with allthis finger-pointing shit.

1:16:46.036 --> 1:16:47.994
Diego is in trouble?

1:16:48.125 --> 1:16:49.692
I need answers right now.

1:16:49.822 --> 1:16:51.345
That's what I'm trying to explain to you.

1:16:51.476 --> 1:16:54.958
I don't know you. Who are you?Who is this man?

1:16:55.088 --> 1:16:58.701
Robert. Listen, I'm trying to explain
reason Diego is in trouble. It's partially

1:16:58.831 --> 1:17:00.224
this fucker's fault too-

1:17:00.354 --> 1:17:02.487
My fault? Who put him in the street? You
put him in the street!

1:17:02.618 --> 1:17:04.141
Diego is in the street?

1:17:04.271 --> 1:17:04.881
Oh my God-

1:17:05.011 --> 1:17:08.711
What the hell is going on?

1:17:08.841 --> 1:17:11.539
You come and wake me out of my sleep.

1:17:11.670 --> 1:17:14.064
I'm sorry, ma'am. I apologize.

1:17:14.194 --> 1:17:19.939
Got me son in whole lot of trouble.

1:17:20.070 --> 1:17:24.117
Donde esta. Donde? Donde?

1:17:24.248 --> 1:17:25.902
Ma'am I just want to tell you I-

1:17:26.032 --> 1:17:32.473
Mami, stop it. let's find out what's
happening with Diego.

1:17:32.604 --> 1:17:35.825
Okay, I will once you ask her to put that
Bible down.

1:17:35.955 --> 1:17:45.835
Can we get Diego out?
Can you stop it please?

1:17:45.965 --> 1:17:48.489
Go ahead.

1:17:48.620 --> 1:17:51.667
Look, I just need to say that I need youguys to trust me. I have-

1:17:51.797 --> 1:17:57.368
So you mean to tell me, you've been
keeping me from my boys because of what I

1:17:57.498 --> 1:18:00.501
do, when Diego is doing the same thing with him?

1:18:00.632 --> 1:18:02.590
What kind of shit is that?

1:18:02.721 --> 1:18:08.074
Diego's not like you. He got into a little
bit of trouble this time. He's not like you.

1:18:08.205 --> 1:18:10.120
We will trust him this one time.

1:18:10.250 --> 1:18:12.035
He doesn't even know what he is doing-

1:18:12.165 --> 1:18:17.214
It's our only option. Trust him, not you.

1:18:17.344 --> 1:18:25.048
Tell us how you're going to get Diego out
of jail.

1:18:25.178 --> 1:18:44.763
[police scanner]

1:18:44.894 --> 1:18:46.852
What the hell are you doing in here?

1:18:46.983 --> 1:18:47.766
We need to talk.

1:18:47.897 --> 1:18:49.028
C'mon, get to the point!

1:18:49.159 --> 1:18:51.552
Manners.

1:18:51.683 --> 1:18:56.079
I'm a detective. I need to be doing
detective work. Not fooling around with you.

1:18:56.209 --> 1:18:57.384
Man, I haven't seen you in months.

1:18:57.515 --> 1:18:58.908
Robert.

1:18:59.038 --> 1:19:03.390
Okay, okay. Sorry. I'm in a bit of a bind
now.

1:19:03.521 --> 1:19:05.523
What kind of a bind?

1:19:05.653 --> 1:19:08.265
I'm talking 2008 Joshua Tree type of
bind.

1:19:08.395 --> 1:19:10.223
Oh, shit.

1:19:10.354 --> 1:19:13.879
Exactly. I got this friend who got caught
up in a mess trying to take care of his

1:19:14.010 --> 1:19:16.534
family. He got caught by some undercover
cops.

1:19:16.664 --> 1:19:19.580
I'm sorry to hear it, Robert, but there's
nothing I can do about it! It's not my

1:19:19.711 --> 1:19:20.712
department!

1:19:20.843 --> 1:19:23.715
C'mon, man.

1:19:23.846 --> 1:19:27.675
Listen. They just don't do anything about
that unless you can bring somebody

1:19:27.806 --> 1:19:31.244
bigger in.

1:19:31.375 --> 1:19:37.642
Our justice system is just perfect. What
if I told you I can get you somebody

1:19:37.773 --> 1:19:39.731
bigger? I'm talking way bigger.

1:19:39.862 --> 1:19:41.124
I don't know.

1:19:41.254 --> 1:19:46.782
C'mon, Carl! This could be a career changer.

1:19:46.912 --> 1:19:53.571
Fine. What's the plan?

1:19:53.701 --> 1:19:59.577
I like this song, it's a good song.
Hey, you sure you got all the money?

1:19:59.707 --> 1:20:02.710
Yes. Do you have the pill bottles?

1:20:02.841 --> 1:20:04.103
Yeah.

1:20:04.234 --> 1:20:05.626
Where?

1:20:05.757 --> 1:20:15.941
What do you mean where?
They're in my boxers. Under my balls.

1:20:16.072 --> 1:20:19.466
Let's do this.

1:20:19.597 --> 1:20:21.817
Dude, are you sure this is going to work?

1:20:21.947 --> 1:20:25.124
No. But I owe Diego.

1:20:25.255 --> 1:20:26.647
I don't owe Diego shit.

1:20:26.778 --> 1:20:31.000
But, you're still here.

1:20:31.130 --> 1:20:36.309
We're headed inside. Copy copy.

1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:37.267
You talking to your button?

1:20:37.397 --> 1:20:40.052
No, you fuckhead. I've got a wire on.

1:20:40.183 --> 1:20:42.707
You have a wire? Why don't I get a wire?

1:20:42.838 --> 1:20:49.409
Because you suck under pressure.

1:20:49.540 --> 1:20:52.673
Hey, okay fine. But how are we going to
get them to admit they they're the ones

1:20:52.804 --> 1:20:54.675
selling the drugs, when it was us?

1:20:54.806 --> 1:20:59.332
I don't know. But that's why I'm dependenton you to take those pictures.

1:20:59.463 --> 1:21:02.553
That one, simple task. One simple talk.

1:21:02.683 --> 1:21:07.340
Alright. Okay I got it.

1:21:07.471 --> 1:21:13.085
Rob! you finally made it for payday.I hope you have my interest.

1:21:13.216 --> 1:21:15.392
Boss. I wouldn't have it any other way!

1:21:15.522 --> 1:21:23.748
Briefcase, please.

1:21:23.879 --> 1:21:27.970
And I see you brought a friend.

1:21:28.100 --> 1:21:30.189
Hi. Name is Peanut.

1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:34.672
Well, that's dumb as hell.

1:21:34.802 --> 1:21:39.590
Thank you? Oh, oh yeah. Your boss-ness.
Can I use your bathroom?

1:21:39.720 --> 1:21:41.592
Pat him down.

1:21:41.722 --> 1:21:44.377
[giggling] hey, watch it!

1:21:44.508 --> 1:21:45.596
He's clean.

1:21:45.726 --> 1:21:48.207
Just protocol.

1:21:48.338 --> 1:21:51.645
Hurry up. And don't flush no paper towels
neither!

1:21:51.776 --> 1:21:55.127
How about tampons?

1:21:55.258 --> 1:22:01.090
Y'know, Robert? I like you. If you had one
ounce of self-control, I'd let you work

1:22:01.220 --> 1:22:06.486
for me. Y'know there's one thing I do like
about you, I can't lie.

1:22:06.617 --> 1:22:08.532
What's that?

1:22:08.662 --> 1:22:13.929
As long as I've known you, you've been all
about yourself. I love that. You never put

1:22:14.059 --> 1:22:16.540
yourself on the line for anyone else.

1:22:16.670 --> 1:22:18.934
Well, thank you, Boss.

1:22:19.064 --> 1:22:22.502
That is good! In business!

1:22:22.633 --> 1:22:26.158
Well, I've been thinking about turning
over a new leaf in life.

1:22:26.289 --> 1:22:34.775
[laughing]

1:22:34.906 --> 1:22:44.960
Alright. Peanut time.
One... two... three...

1:22:45.090 --> 1:22:51.749
four...

1:22:51.879 --> 1:22:54.056
[knock knock] We're waiting!

1:22:54.186 --> 1:22:59.278
Yeah, I'm hurrying! I just, uh... gotta,
gotta eat more fiber. Gotta get more fiber

1:22:59.409 --> 1:23:04.066
in my diet.

1:23:04.196 --> 1:23:09.158
Wait, wait, no wait! Occupied!

1:23:09.288 --> 1:23:11.725
Boss. Boss.

1:23:11.856 --> 1:23:13.292
Hey, it's a new jacket, man!

1:23:13.423 --> 1:23:15.729
This little bastard was trying to frame us
with some drug shit!

1:23:15.860 --> 1:23:17.949
Pictures on the phone and everything.

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:22.998
Pictures on the phone, huh?

1:23:23.128 --> 1:23:25.478
Kill him.

1:23:25.609 --> 1:23:28.394
Woah, woah. No, no, no. Hold up.

1:23:28.525 --> 1:23:30.309
Isn't there something we can do instead?

1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:31.876
Nope.

1:23:32.007 --> 1:23:34.705
We're about to do to you what we did to
that dumb ass mayor.

1:23:34.835 --> 1:23:39.797
What... what the fuck?

1:23:39.927 --> 1:23:42.495
My bad.

1:23:42.626 --> 1:23:46.195
You killed the mayor?

1:23:46.325 --> 1:23:52.331
Well. Cats are out of the bag, so... yeah.

1:23:52.462 --> 1:23:57.293
You ready to meet him? Huh?

1:23:57.423 --> 1:24:10.654
Police! Don't move! Hands in the air!

1:24:10.784 --> 1:24:13.700
Go play. Go play for a little bit.

1:24:13.831 --> 1:24:14.745
Feels good to be free.

1:24:14.875 --> 1:24:17.574
Tie your shoe.

1:24:17.704 --> 1:24:24.233
It's good to be free, but you know what's
even better? Look up.

1:24:24.363 --> 1:24:30.978
Karen!

1:24:31.109 --> 1:24:33.024
I thought I'd never see you again.

1:24:33.155 --> 1:24:35.809
Please. I mean, even I could do two
days in the joint.

1:24:35.940 --> 1:24:40.901
You think so?

1:24:41.032 --> 1:24:44.514
Since school's starting up, I guess I
don't have any time to get in trouble.

1:24:44.644 --> 1:24:48.474
Oh, well, we will have some time for
recess, though.

1:24:48.605 --> 1:25:09.756
No, no, no. No baby-making here. No, no.

1:25:09.887 --> 1:25:15.371
Ahem. Cold turkey.

1:25:15.501 --> 1:25:35.478
I can get my blood transfusion, you can go
cold turkey, baby. Gimme. Gracias.

1:25:35.608 --> 1:25:38.307
So naive.

1:25:38.437 --> 1:25:51.233
Mom, mom, mom! Ow! Here!

1:25:51.363 --> 1:25:54.410
So what happened to the man that had to
save Uncle Diego?

1:25:54.540 --> 1:25:58.457
I don't know!
