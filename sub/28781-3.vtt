WEBVTT

00:02.790 --> 00:04.030
<i>With the plan we put
in motion,</i>

00:04.210 --> 00:05.920
<i>the battle for Wegthor
will soon be over,</i>

00:06.080 --> 00:08.039
<i>and the Resistance
will be shattered.</i>

00:08.210 --> 00:10.370
<i>Dru-Zod sent me
up here to be his spy.</i>

00:10.550 --> 00:11.710
<i>He has Cor-Vex.</i>

00:11.880 --> 00:13.250
There's gonna be
a solar flare today.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.710
Zod has been using these flares
as windows

00:15.890 --> 00:17.300
to bring in more supplies.

00:17.470 --> 00:19.630
<i>If this works, it will be
a much-needed victory.</i>

00:19.810 --> 00:20.800
Don't let her
out of your sight.

00:20.970 --> 00:22.090
<i>Did you pass on
the information?</i>

00:22.270 --> 00:23.720
<i>Yes, but they're still
suspicious.</i>

00:23.890 --> 00:26.010
Then you need to regain
their trust.

00:26.190 --> 00:29.060
<i>I need you to find the Codex
and then bring it to me.</i>

00:29.650 --> 00:30.390
<i>Where'd you learn
to fight like that?</i>

00:30.570 --> 00:31.980
A lover in
the Military Guild--

00:32.150 --> 00:33.360
<i>combat instructor.</i>

00:33.530 --> 00:36.520
We're looking for a traitor,
used to be one of our own.

00:41.410 --> 00:42.070
Dev.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.700
Name's Lobo.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.330
Brainiac killed
your entire race?

00:48.500 --> 00:49.870
My home, gone.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.580
The sensor isn't registering
any Brainiac.

00:52.760 --> 00:56.090
Where the frag is he?

00:57.640 --> 01:01.000
Well, well, well,
it looks like Brainiac

01:01.180 --> 01:03.920
- is in you.
- Ah!

01:04.099 --> 01:05.140
<i>I don't know
if I'm gonna be able</i>

01:05.310 --> 01:05.970
<i>to hold him off much longer.</i>

01:06.140 --> 01:07.930
Listen, I can't go back
to Krypton.

01:08.110 --> 01:11.270
It must end for Brainiac here.

01:43.890 --> 01:46.470
Seg!
Seg!

01:47.100 --> 01:49.640
Would you just stop?
I can't breathe.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.610
Seg.

01:58.530 --> 01:59.690
Come on.

02:00.910 --> 02:02.520
I know we're fleeing for
our lives here,

02:02.700 --> 02:05.610
but I can't keep running
forever.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.949
Are we running forever?

02:09.120 --> 02:11.790
As soon as Lobo regenerates,
he will find and dismantle us.

02:11.960 --> 02:15.080
"Dismantle"?
What's wrong with "kill," man?

02:15.260 --> 02:17.040
The more distance we put
between him and us,

02:17.220 --> 02:18.710
the greater chance we have
at surviving.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.840
I understand the concept
of running away, okay?

02:21.010 --> 02:22.380
I do it a lot.

02:23.010 --> 02:26.050
I find it usually works best
if we know where we're going.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.840
So let's just...

02:29.100 --> 02:31.690
just take a minute
and come up with a plan.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.020
Staying in one location
is not logical.

02:34.190 --> 02:35.730
Would you just stop being--

02:37.240 --> 02:39.570
would you just stop being
Brainiac for a second?

02:40.450 --> 02:42.650
Now, we got to get
one thing straight

02:42.820 --> 02:44.820
before we just
keep moving forward here.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.700
Adam, you're wasting
valuable time.

02:46.870 --> 02:48.580
What I have to say
is worth it.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.150
Okay?

02:50.330 --> 02:52.320
Now, I know that you're not
gonna Zeta-Beam

02:52.500 --> 02:54.080
back to Krypton
with Brainiac inside you.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.910
And...I understand that

02:57.090 --> 03:01.710
having Brainiac inside you
is probably uncomfortable.

03:02.930 --> 03:04.590
Annoying.
More annoying?

03:04.760 --> 03:06.470
- Adam--
- Just let me finish.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.260
Okay?

03:08.430 --> 03:10.270
And if we can't find a way
to get Brainiac out of you,

03:10.440 --> 03:13.140
then--then we don't go back
to Krypton, and I get that.

03:13.310 --> 03:14.300
Okay?
But, hey...

03:15.610 --> 03:19.650
Seg, killing you, like...

03:19.820 --> 03:23.860
like you so Brainiac-ly
suggested...

03:25.620 --> 03:27.230
That's not gonna
happen, man.

03:29.790 --> 03:32.450
Hell, I can't even bring myself
to kill bugs in my apartment,

03:32.620 --> 03:34.110
and I got a lot of bugs
in my apartment.

03:34.290 --> 03:35.530
- It's kind of a sh--
- Ad--

03:37.670 --> 03:38.830
Seg?

03:47.100 --> 03:50.310
<i>Come near me, Seg-El.</i>

03:54.600 --> 03:56.720
Welcome home,

03:57.230 --> 04:00.190
Son of Krypton.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.310
This isn't home.

04:02.490 --> 04:03.900
It can be.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.490
Whatever game
you're playing...

04:09.490 --> 04:11.240
you will lose.

04:13.370 --> 04:16.209
Your will is impressive.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.870
You have demonstrated
a curious capacity

04:19.050 --> 04:22.880
for survival
against significant odds.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.720
I've chosen to live on...

04:27.930 --> 04:29.290
in you.

04:30.060 --> 04:31.590
You didn't choose me.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.140
You need me.

04:34.390 --> 04:36.100
We need each other.

04:37.230 --> 04:38.390
No.

04:39.150 --> 04:41.390
No, you invaded my body
because the damage

04:41.570 --> 04:43.480
you sustained
in the Phantom Zone.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.190
You need a host body
to cultivate...

04:49.080 --> 04:52.030
for replacement
bio-organic components.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.490
You intrigue me,
Son of Krypton.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.000
You nearly defeated me
in Kandor.

04:58.670 --> 04:59.870
I did defeat you.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.840
And there it is...

05:03.340 --> 05:04.960
that will.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.840
It is special.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.010
Give in to me,

05:11.600 --> 05:16.220
and you shall have
eternal life.

05:16.390 --> 05:18.180
You can shove
your eternal life

05:18.360 --> 05:19.810
up your eternal asshole.

05:19.980 --> 05:24.270
Think of it--
freedom from worry,

05:24.860 --> 05:26.570
from pain...

05:27.610 --> 05:29.360
freedom from uncertainty

05:29.530 --> 05:33.200
and the heavy burdens
you carry.

05:34.830 --> 05:38.120
Well, burdens
build character.

05:40.170 --> 05:44.630
We can achieve anything
we want,

05:45.050 --> 05:48.590
you and I...

05:50.220 --> 05:51.760
As one.

05:55.770 --> 05:57.010
Yes.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.640
Yes, we can.

06:03.020 --> 06:04.260
<i>Buddy, I'm kind of
freaking out here.</i>

06:04.440 --> 06:05.730
You can't just do this
when we got--

06:06.900 --> 06:08.990
Yeah, yeah, I'm back.

06:09.820 --> 06:10.530
Is that you?

06:10.700 --> 06:11.530
Yeah, yeah,
I can hear you, Adam.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.320
- Great. Where'd you go?
- Uh...

06:15.330 --> 06:17.540
I was inside my head,

06:17.960 --> 06:19.120
and Brainiac was there.

06:19.290 --> 06:21.200
But at the same time,
I was inside Brainiac's head,

06:21.380 --> 06:22.160
and it was...

06:22.340 --> 06:24.700
That's really weird
and so confusing--

06:24.880 --> 06:25.920
No, no, no, I know.
I know.

06:26.090 --> 06:27.960
I know it--it doesn't
make sense,

06:28.130 --> 06:29.120
but just try and stay with me.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.010
Brainiac needs me.
He's weak.

06:32.180 --> 06:34.340
He needs an organic host
so he can strip it for parts

06:34.510 --> 06:35.630
and repair himself.

06:35.810 --> 06:36.840
You were right--
this isn't like Rhom.

06:37.020 --> 06:38.380
This isn't like
the Voice of Rao.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.770
I'm not a Sentry.
Brainiac doesn't control me.

06:42.190 --> 06:43.050
At least not yet.

06:44.690 --> 06:45.900
I'm smelling a big, hairy
"but" coming up.

06:46.070 --> 06:49.360
Yeah, but he would...
eventually.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.650
Except that's not
gonna happen, see?

06:53.160 --> 06:55.490
Because while Brainiac
has access to my mind

06:55.660 --> 06:57.280
and my memories,

06:57.450 --> 07:01.200
I also have access
to his mind, his memories.

07:02.830 --> 07:03.920
Hell yeah.

07:06.550 --> 07:08.250
I know what we have to do.

07:09.050 --> 07:11.040
I know how to beat Brainiac.

07:13.010 --> 07:15.630
Well, I had a plan, too,
but we can go with yours.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.110
Make sure you've stripped
all radiation-based weapons

07:39.290 --> 07:40.780
out of those crates.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.530
We're sitting on a pile
of raw Stellarium here.

07:46.250 --> 07:49.340
These Sagitari oxygenators
deliver a higher dosage

07:49.510 --> 07:50.590
than what we've been using.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.550
That said,
they won't last forever,

07:53.930 --> 07:56.130
so keep track
of your O-2 sensor.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.260
You must replenish

07:59.720 --> 08:03.140
as soon as your sensor
indicates low oxygen levels,

08:03.560 --> 08:05.020
or you risk asphyxiation.

08:06.440 --> 08:09.900
These can save your life
out here.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.940
Val, I need a word.

08:21.750 --> 08:24.960
All right,
we'll go inside.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.960
The Sagitari escorts
we captured

08:40.140 --> 08:42.179
with the supply convoy--

08:42.350 --> 08:43.840
I'm gonna question them
about Zod's plans.

08:44.020 --> 08:47.560
Okay, but please show
some restraint.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.770
Remember, they're not
all regular Sagitari.

08:50.110 --> 08:51.640
Most are conscripts.

08:51.820 --> 08:53.100
You really want to take away
the only fun

08:53.280 --> 08:54.640
I get to have up here,
don't you?

08:55.950 --> 08:57.440
No, I'm just saying that...

08:57.620 --> 08:59.900
they didn't all choose
to be here.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.780
Go easy, and you might find
that more than a few

09:01.950 --> 09:03.660
are ready to join our side.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.740
These are all good people,

09:07.040 --> 09:09.120
and we've lost too many
of them.

09:09.630 --> 09:11.490
It's good to see them
feeling hopeful again.

09:13.210 --> 09:15.210
Ah, this is
a teaching moment, isn't it?

09:15.380 --> 09:17.800
No, no, no, it's not
a teaching moment.

09:19.350 --> 09:22.590
But you do realize Nyssa
is the reason

09:22.770 --> 09:24.300
you have those Sagitari
to question...

09:24.730 --> 09:26.840
and all of this.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.510
Teaching moment.

09:30.020 --> 09:33.060
And, yes,
we do have Nyssa to thank.

09:35.030 --> 09:37.190
It's perfect timing, though,
isn't it?

09:37.360 --> 09:39.700
The intel Nyssa gave us
was accurate,

09:39.870 --> 09:42.700
and because of that,
not one life was lost.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.370
We need to keep the fight
on the surface,

09:51.540 --> 09:53.080
where we have the advantage.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.710
If we continue to engage
the Rebels in the mines,

09:55.880 --> 09:58.750
we will continue to suffer
unacceptable losses.

09:58.930 --> 10:01.460
And I hate losing even
one Kryptonian life.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.770
I saw our world disappear
from the cosmos,

10:06.940 --> 10:09.640
and everything I loved
about Krypton--

10:09.810 --> 10:13.900
its art, its culture,
its people, our family--

10:16.280 --> 10:17.730
I saw it all vanish.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.690
And what's worse...

10:21.870 --> 10:23.780
it could have been prevented,

10:23.950 --> 10:26.990
but no one was willing to do
what was required.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.490
You know, it was you
who taught me

10:32.670 --> 10:34.380
about calculated risks...

10:35.340 --> 10:36.920
hard sacrifices.

10:39.380 --> 10:42.250
You are the reason I survived

10:42.430 --> 10:44.800
to return and make
things right.

10:44.970 --> 10:46.880
But I don't know that person.

10:48.100 --> 10:49.340
What you're talking about,

10:49.520 --> 10:53.180
it all happened in the past
to you.

10:53.820 --> 10:58.310
I haven't lived it yet,
and I need to start today.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.440
What is your ask, Lyta?

11:00.610 --> 11:02.700
Send me to Wegthor.
Let me end this.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.770
Val, at least,
will listen to me.

11:04.950 --> 11:06.190
I can broker a surrender,

11:06.370 --> 11:09.110
I can save Kryptonians
on both sides.

11:09.290 --> 11:12.620
Lyta, you must know...

11:13.840 --> 11:16.000
you are the most valuable
person to me.

11:16.170 --> 11:19.660
I'm also your most valuable
asset in this war.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.670
You say you trust the person
I become,

11:21.840 --> 11:24.340
well, let me be
that person now.

11:25.390 --> 11:26.720
Please...

11:27.560 --> 11:29.340
Dru, let me go.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.920
What'd you do
with the bodies?

12:01.510 --> 12:02.540
What bodies?

12:03.430 --> 12:04.840
Good.

12:06.970 --> 12:09.010
And don't worry
about their skimmer.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.220
It's been taken care of.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.100
Dev, I want to thank you
for saving--

12:17.270 --> 12:18.640
No, I didn't do it for you.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.310
Those Sagitari weren't
looking for me.

12:23.530 --> 12:25.900
They were
after you, Dev. Why?

12:40.130 --> 12:43.120
Dev! Talk to me.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.260
- Whatever's happened--
- It doesn't matter.

12:46.970 --> 12:50.090
I'm done with the Sagitari,
Kandor, all of it.

12:50.930 --> 12:52.300
Does that include Lyta?

12:55.440 --> 12:57.430
You've been gone a long time.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.520
I thought you were dead.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.480
Everyone thought
you were dead.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.240
Why would you
come back, Jayna?

13:06.070 --> 13:07.810
I need help.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.280
Listen to me.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.740
I have a plan.
That's why I'm here.

13:14.910 --> 13:16.150
A plan?

13:16.830 --> 13:18.370
To do what?

13:19.250 --> 13:21.660
To save Lyta.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.370
To kill Dru-Zod.

13:24.550 --> 13:27.040
You have no idea what's
been going on, do you?

13:27.590 --> 13:29.380
Save Lyta?

13:29.890 --> 13:33.510
She's Dru-Zod's right hand--
the Primus.

13:33.850 --> 13:36.970
That can't be by choice.
That's not Lyta.

13:37.150 --> 13:41.100
You don't know Lyta,
not anymore.

13:41.610 --> 13:43.850
Then tell me what you know,
so I can understand.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.850
- Then we can do some--
- There is no "we"!

13:47.780 --> 13:51.440
Everything I believe in,
everything I worked for,

13:51.870 --> 13:54.530
in memory of my family,
it's all shit.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.370
It's all a lie.

13:56.790 --> 13:59.870
I want nothing more to do
with this, do you understand?

14:00.920 --> 14:02.910
We're relics, Jayna...

14:03.500 --> 14:05.500
ghosts of another time.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.540
Not if we help each other.

14:08.930 --> 14:11.090
Yes, let's.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.890
Pretend you never saw me,
and I'll do the same.

14:33.490 --> 14:35.700
I don't see any sign
of that crazy bastard.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.860
You think we gave him the slip?

14:38.870 --> 14:39.610
Lobo doesn't strike me

14:39.790 --> 14:41.660
as the type to give up easy.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.300
- What?
- Huh?

14:49.840 --> 14:51.130
Nothing.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.880
Okay, something.

14:53.050 --> 14:54.890
Are you talking to Brainiac
same time you're talking to me?

14:57.520 --> 14:59.300
Sort of.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.890
It's more like I can feel
him trying to take control.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.520
There's a struggle within me.

15:05.690 --> 15:08.400
Oh, yeah, I think it might
have been those berries

15:08.570 --> 15:09.650
you said to eat.

15:09.820 --> 15:11.530
I'm feeling
a little bloated, too.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.440
- I said not to eat them.
- You said to eat them.

15:13.620 --> 15:14.950
I'm completely certain
I didn't.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.110
I'm pretty sure--I'm not
gonna call you a liar,

15:17.290 --> 15:18.780
but that's not what I heard.

15:19.790 --> 15:20.900
Where is this place, anyway?

15:21.710 --> 15:22.910
What is it exactly?

15:23.080 --> 15:24.750
It's part
of the planet's mainframe.

15:25.170 --> 15:26.330
It's the natal chamber

15:26.500 --> 15:28.090
where the ancient Coluans
birthed Brainiac.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.670
"Birthed”?
What do you mean "birthed"?

15:30.510 --> 15:32.250
What do you mean
what do I mean "birthed"?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.630
It came into being,
became sentient.

15:36.810 --> 15:37.470
What do you want me to say?

15:37.640 --> 15:39.010
It sounds like the planet
shit him out.

15:39.180 --> 15:40.260
I mean...

15:40.980 --> 15:42.470
no, but kind of.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.430
Uh-huh.

15:45.690 --> 15:48.480
Look, I saw it
in Brainiac's mind.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.230
The natal chamber is dormant
right now,

15:50.400 --> 15:51.940
but as soon
as I've connected to it,

15:52.110 --> 15:54.400
it will detect Brainiac
and anchor him into place.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.360
Hmm, and then you pull free.

15:56.530 --> 15:58.450
I activate
the Zeta-Beam Device...

15:58.620 --> 15:59.780
And we go back to Krypton,

15:59.950 --> 16:01.790
leaving a weakened
Brainiac here

16:01.960 --> 16:04.290
for our murderous, hairy friend
Lobo to kill.

16:04.460 --> 16:06.450
- Yeah, I like that plan.
- Thank you.

16:06.630 --> 16:08.290
Except for the parts
that suck...

16:08.460 --> 16:10.700
like connecting a super villain
to a supercomputer.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.500
How do I even know that
I'm talking to the real Seg?

16:15.050 --> 16:16.260
Adam...

16:16.800 --> 16:18.090
you can trust me.

16:19.020 --> 16:19.970
Besides...

16:22.020 --> 16:25.060
don't really have
much choice now, do you?

16:28.860 --> 16:31.570
So our POWs claim that
Zod's preparing to move

16:31.740 --> 16:34.570
most of his forces from
their Forward Operating Base

16:34.740 --> 16:36.100
to the Elevator Base Station.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.730
He's preparing
a major offensive.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.820
There's only one possible
route they could use,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.410
and that's topside.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.530
We could use
our existing oxygenators

16:45.710 --> 16:48.450
to attack them en route,
cut a hole in their line,

16:48.630 --> 16:50.960
then we use these
newly confiscated supplies

16:51.130 --> 16:52.340
to push further forward,

16:52.510 --> 16:54.370
all the way
to the Elevator Base Station.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.590
If we gain control
of the Space Elevator,

16:58.010 --> 16:59.920
this could level
the playing field,

17:00.100 --> 17:02.130
isolate Zod's remaining forces.

17:02.310 --> 17:04.089
He wouldn't be able to keep
sending up reinforcements

17:04.270 --> 17:05.630
and supplies
the way he has been.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.640
This could be the tipping point
we need.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.240
Need some company?

17:28.920 --> 17:30.120
I already have some.

17:30.290 --> 17:32.000
He's not much
of a talker, though.

17:34.510 --> 17:37.120
Hmm.
Anything else you need?

17:38.090 --> 17:40.050
Apart from the obvious?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.220
Nyssa, I know how hard it is
for you to be here

17:44.390 --> 17:45.800
while Cor is with Zod.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.470
And I promise I will do
everything in my power

17:48.650 --> 17:50.480
to help you get him back.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.260
You're not alone.

17:53.570 --> 17:55.560
I just want to hold him, Val.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.950
I wish Seg could see him,
hold him, too.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.910
I believe Seg will be back.

18:07.790 --> 18:10.030
And I believe
if he were here now,

18:10.840 --> 18:12.920
he'd be grateful for all
you're doing for Cor,

18:13.710 --> 18:15.080
for Krypton.

18:15.590 --> 18:19.750
When most people look at me,
they see my father still.

18:20.970 --> 18:22.880
But Seg saw something else.

18:24.140 --> 18:28.260
He saw something in me that
even I didn't see in myself.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.930
But now everything
has changed.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.220
Seg's gone,

18:35.440 --> 18:38.150
and I'm back to not knowing
who I really am anymore.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.230
It wasn't Seg

18:39.410 --> 18:41.770
who gave the Rebellion
hope today, Nyssa.

18:42.530 --> 18:43.860
It was you.

18:44.580 --> 18:45.690
That's who you are.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.030
You sound just like him.

18:49.210 --> 18:52.290
Thank you.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.580
Though I'm older than Seg,
so he sounds like me.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.260
And you sound nothing
like Daron...

19:01.050 --> 19:03.170
you'll forgive me for saying.

19:04.930 --> 19:05.800
Thank you.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.260
I know you didn't get
the answers

19:07.430 --> 19:09.550
you needed from Daron.

19:10.690 --> 19:13.050
But it's not the past
that defines you.

19:13.730 --> 19:15.890
It's how you choose to live
moving forward.

19:19.780 --> 19:22.240
It's hard to move forward
when you're in lockdown.

19:25.870 --> 19:28.910
Well, I see no reason
to monitor your every move,

19:29.080 --> 19:31.320
since there's really nowhere
for you to go.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.290
Leave it with me.

19:33.460 --> 19:36.500
Thank you, Val,
for believing in me.

19:36.800 --> 19:37.790
Hmm.

19:43.220 --> 19:45.680
Give her some space.

19:56.110 --> 19:58.440
Weird that this planet
smells like peaches.

19:58.610 --> 20:00.100
Don't you think that's weird?

20:01.780 --> 20:03.400
Natal chamber's
through there.

20:03.860 --> 20:05.610
Uh, through there?
No.

20:05.780 --> 20:07.900
That's--that can't be it.

20:08.450 --> 20:10.190
- Look at how dark it is...
- Mm.

20:10.370 --> 20:12.410
I mean, so...
that can't be it.

20:12.580 --> 20:13.740
I mean, you should check a map
or something,

20:13.920 --> 20:15.530
'cause, I mean, look
at how dark that is.

20:15.710 --> 20:17.670
Yeah. I'll see you
down there, Earth man.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.090
What?

20:20.260 --> 20:22.040
I tell you, it's the wrong way.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.920
Really? Just gonna play
it like that?

20:29.180 --> 20:30.800
God damn it.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.300
This is where it all began.

21:13.980 --> 21:16.260
Ah. Okay.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.680
So what now?

21:19.150 --> 21:20.760
Well, once we've connected,

21:20.940 --> 21:22.900
the separation process
should begin.

21:23.320 --> 21:24.280
How so?

21:25.610 --> 21:26.850
I'm not sure.

21:27.950 --> 21:30.490
Once I get connected, the, uh,
pod will take care of the rest.

21:30.660 --> 21:32.780
- Rest of what?
- I don't know, Adam.

21:32.950 --> 21:34.440
I haven't found occasion
to explore

21:34.620 --> 21:36.990
each of the 12 levels of
intellect I currently possess.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.620
I do apologize.

21:38.790 --> 21:41.710
Okay. Well, you don't have
to be a dick about it.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.290
Look, man, I'm--

21:47.720 --> 21:49.080
Seg?

21:49.260 --> 21:52.850
I can smell
your fraggin' auras!

21:53.020 --> 21:56.130
You can't hide
from <i>El Cazadorez!</i>

22:00.900 --> 22:03.110
Really?
Right now?

22:10.910 --> 22:14.150
You're hiding something
from me.

22:14.580 --> 22:15.990
So are you.

22:16.580 --> 22:21.120
What you hide is the key
to your survival...

22:22.210 --> 22:23.500
To your will.

22:23.670 --> 22:25.290
You've been alive
for millennia.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.380
What would it be like for you
to no longer exist...

22:29.640 --> 22:32.340
or, worse, to stop evolving?

22:32.510 --> 22:34.350
Your attempts at distraction
are infantile

22:34.520 --> 22:36.600
and predicated upon
a fundamental misunderstanding

22:36.770 --> 22:37.800
of what I am.

22:37.980 --> 22:39.220
I'm not distracting you.

22:40.310 --> 22:41.890
I'm enduring you.

22:42.940 --> 22:44.480
Curious.

22:45.070 --> 22:48.980
You genuinely believe
you can defeat me.

22:53.620 --> 22:56.360
But I can see
your memories...

22:57.540 --> 22:59.530
your pain...

22:59.960 --> 23:01.790
your fear.

23:03.250 --> 23:04.660
What...

23:05.380 --> 23:08.170
are you keeping from me?

23:13.470 --> 23:16.510
You will lose this battle.

23:17.930 --> 23:21.680
It is purely a matter of time.

23:21.850 --> 23:23.690
Time you're running out of.

23:25.730 --> 23:27.440
What is it...

23:28.240 --> 23:30.980
that you truly desire?

23:33.240 --> 23:35.530
To see the mother
of your child?

23:39.330 --> 23:41.540
To share a libation
with your oldest friend?

23:45.130 --> 23:46.240
Hmm?

23:47.840 --> 23:48.620
Stop.

23:50.010 --> 23:51.870
You won't deceive me like that.

23:52.050 --> 23:54.170
I don't have to deceive you.

23:55.890 --> 23:58.000
I see...

23:58.350 --> 24:00.260
everything.

24:02.690 --> 24:04.350
You are weary.

24:07.110 --> 24:08.520
Rest.

24:15.780 --> 24:18.320
You think you're some kind
of god, but you're not.

24:19.200 --> 24:22.120
You're just a repository
of useless information...

24:22.620 --> 24:24.110
a series of algorithms.

24:24.750 --> 24:27.210
You don't even understand
emotion.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.210
Just because I'm not governed
by emotion

24:31.380 --> 24:33.970
doesn't mean I'm ignorant
of the concept.

24:34.430 --> 24:38.510
I know how to analyze it,

24:38.810 --> 24:43.390
and I know how to exploit it.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.180
<i>I love you.</i>

24:46.060 --> 24:47.680
<i>I do love you.</i>

24:51.740 --> 24:53.100
There we are.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.700
All returning skimming units

25:05.870 --> 25:07.740
<i>report directly
for debriefing.</i>

25:08.290 --> 25:10.130
<i>Returning units
for debriefing.</i>

25:10.300 --> 25:11.290
You summoned me?

25:20.970 --> 25:23.010
I've made a decision...

25:24.230 --> 25:26.340
regarding our next move
on Wegthor.

25:28.690 --> 25:30.930
Go on, drink.

25:31.610 --> 25:33.350
It could be your last chance
for a while.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.940
You're sending me up there?

25:40.700 --> 25:42.070
You were right.

25:45.830 --> 25:47.870
You are my best asset

25:48.330 --> 25:50.670
and our best chance
of ending this war.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.830
It's a calculated risk...

25:54.670 --> 25:56.840
but one I should have taken
a long time ago.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.050
I was reluctant...

26:05.980 --> 26:08.090
Not because I don't think
you're capable,

26:08.900 --> 26:11.890
but because I've already
seen you die once, Mother.

26:12.780 --> 26:16.140
I just couldn't bear to see it
happen again.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.900
How did I die...

26:20.740 --> 26:22.980
in the other future?

26:25.660 --> 26:27.570
You died when you gave up.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.660
The mother I knew...

26:30.580 --> 26:32.200
couldn't let go of the past.

26:33.250 --> 26:36.710
She never forgave herself
for the bottling of Kandor.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.000
She lost her city,

26:39.760 --> 26:41.300
her Sagitari...

26:42.430 --> 26:44.420
and the love of her life.

26:45.470 --> 26:49.220
After that,
she stopped taking risks.

26:50.690 --> 26:54.230
She stopped making
hard choices.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.060
She lost too much.

26:58.860 --> 27:01.780
And all that pain and guilt

27:04.490 --> 27:08.030
just wore her down until...

27:11.920 --> 27:14.830
I can imagine it would be
hard to go on

27:15.000 --> 27:16.870
after something like that.

27:17.050 --> 27:18.250
Yes.

27:18.420 --> 27:20.290
But we must.

27:28.680 --> 27:29.850
We swore an oath

27:30.310 --> 27:32.890
to protect Krypton above all.

27:33.060 --> 27:36.180
And I will not let my past

27:36.360 --> 27:39.400
or my fear of losing you again
threaten that.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.870
Thank you, son.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.750
Gather what you need.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.010
You leave tomorrow.

28:21.860 --> 28:23.100
Come on, big boy.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.820
Okay, uh, come on.

28:28.620 --> 28:30.860
Come on, hook up.
Huh?

28:31.250 --> 28:32.910
Okay.
"Yeah, sure, Adam"--

28:33.080 --> 28:34.370
Hey, Seagull!

28:34.540 --> 28:37.080
You coming out,
or am I coming in?

28:38.300 --> 28:41.910
"Pod will take care
of the rest," my ass.

28:46.050 --> 28:47.590
Holy shit, that worked.

28:49.430 --> 28:51.300
Aah!

29:04.990 --> 29:05.940
Hey, you.

29:06.410 --> 29:08.490
Hi. Uh...

29:08.830 --> 29:10.860
Whoo-wee!
You good-looking!

29:11.040 --> 29:13.320
- Uh, hey, just, um...
- Huh?

29:13.500 --> 29:15.360
Just give me--give us...

29:15.540 --> 29:16.830
You know, a minute.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.960
Just one...

29:32.890 --> 29:36.300
My ar--

29:42.360 --> 29:45.190
You tiny little turd.

29:48.530 --> 29:50.570
You just cut off
my favorite limb.

29:52.790 --> 29:54.740
I'm so gonna go in there
and make you pay.

29:54.910 --> 29:57.000
Oh, that's--that's
interesting,

29:57.170 --> 29:59.410
because, yeah, I'm wondering
how you're gonna get in here

29:59.580 --> 30:01.330
without that.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.590
- Heh.
- Huh?

30:04.760 --> 30:06.960
Huh?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.940
I hope you're not
the squeamish type.

30:23.860 --> 30:24.720
Kinda do.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.460
I was wondering how long
you would take.

30:49.970 --> 30:51.750
Nice to see you, too, Araame.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.590
How did you lose your minder?

30:55.470 --> 30:58.010
Did my combat training
finally pay off?

30:58.390 --> 31:00.350
More times than
you can imagine.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.190
He got called off by Val.

31:04.150 --> 31:06.890
How is it that you came
to working with the Rebels?

31:07.650 --> 31:08.560
You're Military Guild.

31:08.740 --> 31:10.100
I was.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.740
But Jax believes
we're more

31:11.910 --> 31:14.190
than the Genesis Chamber
says we are.

31:14.370 --> 31:16.150
I work for
the best scientists now.

31:16.330 --> 31:17.780
It suits me.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.870
Then I guess we both changed.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.790
I've thought about you,
you know?

31:31.010 --> 31:33.170
We had some nice times.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.920
But your life was
on a set course...

31:41.900 --> 31:43.350
and I like to be free.

31:46.190 --> 31:47.770
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.530
You can make it up to me...

31:54.450 --> 31:55.690
Now.

31:58.790 --> 32:02.330
Come on, just breathe.
Yeah, just breathe, breathe.

32:04.460 --> 32:06.370
<i>Do you remember
the first time we met?</i>

32:07.500 --> 32:09.540
Your friend was drunk.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.960
You thought you were
saving the day.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.750
You were so charming.

32:15.180 --> 32:19.010
No, no, it isn't her.
It isn't her.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.470
Do you not remember?

32:24.900 --> 32:28.730
From the moment I saw you,
I wanted you.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.940
You were so alive.

32:33.490 --> 32:35.070
It isn't you.

32:35.530 --> 32:37.110
It isn't you.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.400
All I want,

32:40.750 --> 32:43.330
all I've ever wanted...

32:43.830 --> 32:45.820
is for us to be together.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.000
I know.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.420
Please...

32:55.300 --> 32:56.420
don't be afraid of me.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.210
I'm not.

33:11.530 --> 33:13.730
It's been so long since
I've seen you.

33:14.700 --> 33:15.980
I'm here now.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.240
Okay.

33:20.410 --> 33:21.990
I missed you, Lyta.

33:28.630 --> 33:30.080
There you go.
You're doing great.

33:31.340 --> 33:34.710
Doesn't look like he's doing
much of anything to me.

33:35.220 --> 33:36.710
What the hell?

33:36.890 --> 33:38.420
Down low, dipshit.

33:38.930 --> 33:41.260
Boo.

33:41.430 --> 33:44.550
- Oh--
- Told you I was coming in.

33:44.730 --> 33:45.930
No freakin' way.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.840
Yes, freakin' way.

33:48.020 --> 33:50.930
You see, if a mother fragger
won't come to the Main Man,

33:51.110 --> 33:55.100
the Main Man will come
to the mother fragger.

35:29.330 --> 35:30.990
No.

35:34.460 --> 35:37.200
So this is where those
Coluan chuckleheads shat out

35:37.380 --> 35:40.920
that green turd all those
thousands of years ago, eh?

35:42.300 --> 35:43.670
What a bunch of d-bags.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.800
So here's the thing--uh...

35:45.970 --> 35:48.090
Seg, here, is doing his best

35:48.270 --> 35:51.880
to also shit out
that green turd as well.

35:52.060 --> 35:52.720
Right.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.930
Uh, so if you could just
hang tight for a little bit,

35:55.110 --> 35:56.390
and we can wrap
this whole thing up.

35:56.570 --> 35:57.810
Yeah, that's not
gonna happen, mate.

35:57.980 --> 35:59.690
It's cute,
but it's not gonna happen.

35:59.860 --> 36:01.230
I'm done waiting, you see.

36:04.780 --> 36:07.870
I don't want to fight you, man,
not like this.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.030
You--

36:11.290 --> 36:12.650
Agh!

36:27.720 --> 36:29.960
I thought
I'd never see you again.

36:30.480 --> 36:33.010
I know.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.600
I love you.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.350
I've always loved you, Seg.

36:43.780 --> 36:44.860
Stop.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.440
I think we're out of time.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.570
But we have forever.

36:53.420 --> 36:56.620
We love each other.
No more pain, right?

36:57.090 --> 36:58.040
Wrong.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.880
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.000
I understand that my pain
is not a problem to be solved.

37:06.720 --> 37:07.380
Seg?

37:07.550 --> 37:10.010
You destroyed Colu,
annihilated your own race,

37:10.180 --> 37:13.140
all because of your need
to control everything.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.100
You think that knowledge
is the key to control.

37:16.270 --> 37:18.100
That's why you collect cities.

37:19.150 --> 37:21.440
And what you're
experiencing now...

37:22.940 --> 37:24.530
is fear...

37:25.240 --> 37:27.820
fear of losing everything
that you know,

37:27.990 --> 37:30.480
fear of losing control.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.530
Savor it before you devolve
into nothing.

37:42.630 --> 37:45.590
Stay with me.

37:45.760 --> 37:50.340
Stay with me!
Stay with me!

37:50.510 --> 37:52.680
It's time.
Welcome home, asshole.

37:57.980 --> 38:02.270
You are so soft.

38:02.440 --> 38:06.110
You're so mean.

38:08.030 --> 38:08.820
Adam?

38:10.620 --> 38:11.700
That's not good.

38:17.370 --> 38:20.910
I had that all under control.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.580
Aah!

38:25.630 --> 38:27.840
You did it.

38:28.010 --> 38:29.420
- You shat him out.
- Adam.

38:29.590 --> 38:31.050
Adam, we got to go.

38:31.220 --> 38:32.590
- We got to go right now.
- Don't you do it.

38:32.760 --> 38:35.130
- Now, now!
- Don't you dare.

38:37.730 --> 38:39.560
So long, bitch.

38:42.440 --> 38:43.770
Frag.

38:50.950 --> 38:53.740
Well, well, well,
looks like the Craptown Boys

38:53.910 --> 38:55.900
delivered on the goods
after all.

38:57.330 --> 38:58.910
Aah!

39:20.060 --> 39:21.140
Dev?

40:22.420 --> 40:23.910
You've decided to
move forward.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.070
Scout reports indicate
the first of the Sagitari units

40:26.250 --> 40:27.790
are preparing to mobilize.

40:28.420 --> 40:30.910
I'm sending additional
artillery to help our forces

40:31.090 --> 40:33.080
already positioned
in Dea-Kin Valley.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.170
It's a perfect choke point.

40:39.140 --> 40:40.720
<i>This will be a massacre.</i>

40:42.270 --> 40:44.130
<i>May Rao have
mercy on us all.</i>

40:49.690 --> 40:51.900
Hey, would you stop flirting
with me?

40:52.070 --> 40:52.900
I'm on duty.

40:53.660 --> 40:54.940
We've got new orders.

40:55.450 --> 40:57.560
Entire unit's mobilizing
for the Elevator Base Station.

40:57.740 --> 40:59.780
Yes!
We are off the front line.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.160
And it's about time
our luck changed.

41:57.140 --> 42:00.750
Oh! Ah!

42:01.060 --> 42:02.840
Son of a bitch.

42:04.310 --> 42:07.850
Holy shit.
I can't believe it worked.

42:08.020 --> 42:09.350
It worked!

42:11.730 --> 42:13.140
Whoo!

42:13.320 --> 42:14.310
Seg.

42:14.860 --> 42:16.850
Seg?

42:17.030 --> 42:19.110
Seg.

42:19.780 --> 42:21.650
Oh, come on, buddy.

42:21.830 --> 42:24.280
You can't die on me now, man.
Come on.

42:24.750 --> 42:25.830
Come on!

42:26.000 --> 42:28.160
You can't die, not now.

42:28.330 --> 42:29.910
Come on.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.870
What happened?

42:32.050 --> 42:35.040
What's going--

42:35.210 --> 42:37.670
Oh, God, I feel weird.

42:37.840 --> 42:41.090
Yeah, riding the Zeta-Beam
ain't for the weak of heart.

42:41.260 --> 42:42.880
No, no, really, man.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.550
I feel like I was dead
or something.

42:44.720 --> 42:46.390
What?
No.

42:46.560 --> 42:48.850
You can't--that's crazy.

42:49.020 --> 42:50.310
You can't die,
because, you know,

42:50.480 --> 42:52.310
you're--you're...

42:52.900 --> 42:53.860
Was I dead?

42:54.030 --> 42:56.270
Maybe just a little bit!
But I un-deaded you!

42:56.440 --> 42:58.730
- Adam, what the--
- Hey, calm down!

42:58.910 --> 43:02.270
Look, we're here.
We made it back, right?

43:02.450 --> 43:04.190
Maybe not in
the heart of Kandor,

43:04.370 --> 43:05.820
but it's not that far, right?

43:07.960 --> 43:09.790
I can't believe I was dead.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.120
And I'm dead tired
of hearing you talk about it.

43:12.290 --> 43:13.830
Besides, we got a lot
of work to do.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.460
We got to defeat a tyrant,
free a planet, remember?

43:18.090 --> 43:18.960
Again?

43:19.130 --> 43:22.170
Hey, it's what us
superheroes do.

43:22.890 --> 43:24.050
No days off.

43:25.180 --> 43:27.010
Let's get to it.

43:29.810 --> 43:31.640
All right.
Whoa.

43:33.730 --> 43:34.850
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
