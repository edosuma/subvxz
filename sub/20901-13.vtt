WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.949
( music playing )

00:03.045 --> 00:05.377
( infected snarling,
banging doors )

00:05.464 --> 00:07.705
( people coughing )

00:07.799 --> 00:09.505
(sighs )

00:13.013 --> 00:15.755
- Man: I got you.
- (groaning )

00:17.476 --> 00:19.432
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.182
( infected pounding doors )
- (Alicia breathing heavily)

00:24.650 --> 00:26.436
Okay.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.610
Man:
Mom?

00:33.116 --> 00:34.401
Mom?

00:36.161 --> 00:38.322
Someone turn on
the goddamn air!

00:41.250 --> 00:43.536
My wife...
where's my wife?

00:45.087 --> 00:46.668
I don't...

00:57.140 --> 00:58.550
(sighs )

01:04.147 --> 01:05.523
Ofelia:
Alicia.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.146
Hey, Alicia.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.070
We've got a problem.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.870
There's nothing
coming through.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.507
This place is sealed.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.010
And it wasn't designed
to house this many.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.886
There must be another way
of getting air in here.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.436
Without that...

01:49.276 --> 01:50.732
We run out of air.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.461
( car door closes )

02:15.552 --> 02:17.588
( infected snarling
in distance )

02:19.222 --> 02:21.383
No time for that, Troy.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.261
- ( zipper zips )
- Gotta leave him.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.139
He was better than us.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.438
That's why he's gone.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.317
The good, they don't survive
in this world.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.190
- Only killers...
- Nick: Shut up, Troy.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.651
Your brother's dead because
you brought a horde down on us.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.824
So, why don't you
quit jerking off about the tragedy of it

02:40.911 --> 02:42.776
and help me do
what Jake would've done

02:42.871 --> 02:45.078
or those people
are gonna die.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.780
And if they do die,

02:46.875 --> 02:48.706
it's not because they
were too good for this world,

02:48.794 --> 02:50.705
it's because we failed.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.583
Blake: The shaft runs
all the way up past the barn.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.340
How long will it take
dragging on our knees and elbows?

03:00.430 --> 03:02.216
About an hour to get there
to clear the blockage.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.808
Ofelia: Right.
Plus we need an hour back.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.803
There might not be
enough air down here to last.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.356
We have maybe two hours

03:13.443 --> 03:15.855
before the carbon dioxide
kills us.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.657
Okay.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.609
So, we move, right?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.821
An hour to the end...
that's best-case scenario?

03:26.915 --> 03:28.655
Unless lack of oxygen
slows us up.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.584
( sighs )
We need to even the odds.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.787
- Ofelia: It's this or nothing.
- It's not worth the risk.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.876
- What other options do we have?
- Alicia: No, it’s not.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.377
We can...

03:41.221 --> 03:42.757
we can buy some time.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.513
Fewer people,
less carbon dioxide.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.777
We put down the bitten.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.781
( quiet chattering)
( woman coughing )

04:10.876 --> 04:12.958
Crazy Dog:
No one will admit it.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.875
Ofelia: It's just a matter of time
before they show symptoms.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.919
We need to strip everyone down
and search them for bites.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.168
Ofelia: They’re not prisoners.
You can 't force them.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.544
Okay, look, we're all
in this together.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.795
Then we're gonna
die together.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.252
Ofelia:
Hey, Alicia.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.381
- Why don't we have the bitten
go clean out the vents?

04:27.476 --> 04:28.591
- We can't send someone sick.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.471
If they die in there, it'll just
make everything worse.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.226
Well, that settles it.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.680
No, wait!

04:34.775 --> 04:36.436
( whispers )
They'll riot.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.062
They'll kill you
for trying to kill them.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.142
They're already dead.

04:41.990 --> 04:45.482
(people chatting quietly)

04:48.121 --> 04:49.327
Everyone?

05:06.473 --> 05:08.088
l... I know you're scared.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.923
- We're all scared.
- ( coughs )

05:10.018 --> 05:12.009
We don't know what's going
to happen out there

05:12.103 --> 05:14.515
and we're less sure
what's going to happen here,

05:14.606 --> 05:17.222
but, uh, this is
what we do know.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.316
The vent is broken.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.820
The only airway
we have is blocked.

05:25.951 --> 05:29.364
Which means
if we can't fix it,

05:29.454 --> 05:30.955
we suffocate.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.655
(all murmuring)

05:33.750 --> 05:35.536
Right now, the enemy
is not what's out there,

05:35.627 --> 05:37.788
it's actually time.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.916
And the more of us there are,
the less time we have.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.544
Man: What do we do?
We ’ve gotta do something.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.714
So, we're asking...

05:48.974 --> 05:52.683
for those of you
who have been bitten

05:52.769 --> 05:54.930
to come forward.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.352
( woman coughing )

06:08.994 --> 06:11.861
( woman coughing )

06:11.955 --> 06:13.491
- I guess we do it the hard way.
- ( clicks )

06:13.582 --> 06:15.243
Stop.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.546
(woman gasps )

06:35.562 --> 06:37.723
No. Baby, no.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.893
It's okay.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.063
( woman sobbing )

06:49.034 --> 06:51.696
Don't do this.
We don't know!

06:55.707 --> 06:58.039
( music playing )

07:03.798 --> 07:07.211
- ( infected snarling )
- Nick: Anyone alive's in the pantry.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.384
It's where they were headed.
Locked themselves in.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.462
All right, so we drive through
the dead to get to them.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.762
There's too many.
We need to create

07:12.849 --> 07:14.555
a way through them
or draw them away.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.512
Okay, we MOAB this shit.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.142
We stored the fuel
from the depot

07:18.229 --> 07:19.935
over on the other side
of the ranch.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.604
We get to the gas,
we torch it,

07:21.691 --> 07:23.556
and we make a break
for the pantry.

07:23.652 --> 07:24.983
Distract them at least.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.731
If it's between that
or do nothing...

07:26.821 --> 07:28.812
( exhales )
it's gotta be that.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.325
( music playing )

07:35.455 --> 07:36.956
( clicks )

07:40.585 --> 07:42.041
Sure you're gonna
be okay down here?

07:42.128 --> 07:43.743
Sure you're gonna
be okay up there?

07:46.591 --> 07:48.206
Let's get this
over with.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.366
Triage painkiller.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.165
The dose
will knock you out.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.962
( woman coughs )

08:28.049 --> 08:29.914
And then what?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.338
Then you'll be
taken care of.

08:36.433 --> 08:40.267
There's not enough
ammunition to shoot us all.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.263
You're gonna stab us?

08:53.116 --> 08:54.822
(whimpering)

08:54.909 --> 08:58.652
(shudders ) Maybe we should, uh,
wait this out a bit longer.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.703
Dax, you're not gonna survive
what's in your blood now.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.872
You know,
I don't feel so bad.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.291
Maybe the bite
didn't go that deep.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.493
Blake: You're feeling it, Stan.
I can see.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.829
I need more time.
Just one more hour.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.668
- We don't have an hour.
- This isn't how it's supposed to end.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.045
- My son needs me.
- Enough.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.881
It's morphine.

09:15.972 --> 09:19.339
It's the best
goddamn feeling in the world.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.425
You'll be in heaven
before you get there.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.318
I'll go.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.526
(people crying,
coughing )

10:11.319 --> 10:13.150
( exhales )

10:24.749 --> 10:25.738
You ready?

10:28.378 --> 10:30.369
Yes.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.674
(squirts)

10:50.859 --> 10:52.065
(sighs )

10:56.322 --> 10:58.187
( breathing heavily )

11:09.919 --> 11:12.831
- (shuddering breath )
( flesh squelches )

11:27.478 --> 11:29.855
( heavy breathing )

11:35.612 --> 11:38.103
( panting )

11:44.370 --> 11:46.952
( crying )

12:00.803 --> 12:02.259
Here.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.347
I know it's hell.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.764
But those people
have done their part.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.686
You need to do yours.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.604
They need you.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.857
They need you
because you're strong.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.944
Don't break on them now.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.206
(shuddering )

12:37.423 --> 12:39.379
(wind howling )

12:41.886 --> 12:44.719
( infected snarling
in distance )

12:44.806 --> 12:47.843
Troy: We’ll create a scene
and get to the stable,

12:47.934 --> 12:49.890
blow the fuel reserve.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.139
All right, be ready.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.144
( music playing )

13:02.240 --> 13:04.196
( snarling )

13:04.284 --> 13:06.240
( grenade launcher
clicks )

13:16.546 --> 13:18.707
- ( engine starts )
- All right, drive.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.762
- Oh! (laughs)
- Shit!

13:37.275 --> 13:39.186
(growling )

13:40.945 --> 13:42.355
Holy shit, man.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.246
Come on, come on,
run, run.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.587
( infected snarling )

13:58.671 --> 13:59.581
(body thuds )

14:05.428 --> 14:06.543
Come on, come on!

14:15.396 --> 14:17.432
( laughs )

14:17.482 --> 14:20.269
- Ah, shit.
- ( laughing )

14:30.661 --> 14:32.913
Blake:
Come on.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.737
Just give me a minute.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.619
It's time.

14:40.171 --> 14:44.039
Alicia, we need
to do this now.

15:20.962 --> 15:23.328
( crying )

15:25.633 --> 15:28.716
I'm sorry
for what I did.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.755
I'm sorry.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.091
( sobbing )

15:37.145 --> 15:38.351
It's okay.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.809
It's gonna be okay.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.334
( morphine squirts )

16:06.716 --> 16:09.958
( exhaling )

16:12.722 --> 16:15.134
( music playing )

16:18.853 --> 16:21.265
( people whispering )

16:27.403 --> 16:30.395
(whispering continues )

16:45.588 --> 16:46.543
(grunts)

16:48.257 --> 16:49.918
Shit!

16:50.009 --> 16:52.341
- Crazy Dog: What?
- There's a drop.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.886
Okay, we're gonna
have to turn around

16:55.973 --> 16:58.180
and go down
feet first, okay?

16:58.267 --> 17:00.178
( sniffles )

17:04.065 --> 17:06.021
(grunting )

17:08.528 --> 17:11.736
( both grunting )

17:21.165 --> 17:24.248
- ( metal creaking )
- ( straining)

17:27.672 --> 17:30.459
( panting )

17:30.550 --> 17:32.711
(straining, panting )

17:32.802 --> 17:34.008
ll/lore.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.136
( screams )

17:41.227 --> 17:43.263
- God damn it, gah!
- Lee.

17:43.354 --> 17:44.890
- ( shouting )
- Hey!

17:44.981 --> 17:46.812
- ( panting )
- Hey.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.355
Stop, you're gonna
hyperventilate.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.854
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.731
I need you
to breathe, okay?

17:52.822 --> 17:56.189
Inhale,
two, three, four.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.742
Exhale,
two, three, four.

17:59.829 --> 18:00.909
Come on,
do it with me.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.533
Inhale.

18:02.623 --> 18:07.959
- One, two, three, four.
- ( breathing slows )

18:11.257 --> 18:13.623
( man coughing )

18:13.718 --> 18:15.709
I shouldn't have
brought them here.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.802
You know, my husband

18:25.896 --> 18:28.558
was in the first Tower
when it fell.

18:31.360 --> 18:35.228
I tried calling his cell
over and over.

18:35.323 --> 18:37.985
I must've called it
a thousand times.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.111
Because then
there was a chance.

18:44.624 --> 18:48.242
A chance I might
hear him again.

18:51.505 --> 18:55.464
( sniffles )
Even when you're hopeless,

18:55.551 --> 18:58.463
hope is all you have.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.556
You've given us
a few precious hours.

19:03.601 --> 19:06.013
There's no shame in that.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.360
I met
my second husband

19:13.444 --> 19:16.356
at a support group
for the families.

19:16.447 --> 19:19.484
Jerry was a paramedic.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.816
First responder.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.448
( laughs )

19:24.538 --> 19:28.156
God, he used
to make me laugh.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.959
They have
to make you laugh.

19:32.046 --> 19:36.335
I mean, good sex
and all that, sure,

19:36.425 --> 19:40.134
but if they're
not funny, forget it.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.506
( chuckles )

19:43.683 --> 19:45.344
What brought you here?

19:47.019 --> 19:50.978
Jerry was convinced
that the Towers falling

19:51.065 --> 19:52.851
was the beginning
of the end.

19:54.068 --> 19:57.856
And I started
to believe him.

19:57.947 --> 20:02.737
So, when we heard
about Otto and the ranch,

20:02.827 --> 20:05.990
it just felt like
a perfect fit.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.117
You were right.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.166
( chuckles )
Were we?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.829
I'm not sure.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.627
We spent
our last years

20:24.223 --> 20:29.217
when we could've been
out there exploring it.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.403
Promise me

20:38.487 --> 20:42.025
you'll never make decisions
based on fear.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.951
That hasn't happened
in a while.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.580
I didn't think
it'd be a problem.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.840
- Sorry.
- No need to apologize.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.177
You were in Iraq, right?

21:09.643 --> 21:10.928
Yeah.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.439
There was stuff
my dad saw.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.110
It haunted him
until the very end.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.943
I guess that's
the price you pay.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.071
(sighs )

21:28.162 --> 21:30.073
Part of it at least.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.164
I lost it once.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.991
In front of my son.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.372
He was terrified of me.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.882
That was one
of the last times I saw him.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.714
He was living with his mom
when everything went to...

21:51.727 --> 21:53.388
(sighs )

21:56.273 --> 21:58.184
I wasn't there
to save him.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.371
You ready to do this?

22:16.001 --> 22:18.253
( sighs )
Yeah.

22:24.885 --> 22:30.050
Christine: Ripping my bra off
at Woodstock.

22:30.140 --> 22:35.100
Pink's with Dad
aﬁerschooL

22:35.187 --> 22:38.475
Christine: Bridge jumping
in Montana.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.231
( laughs )

22:44.280 --> 22:48.193
"This Land is Your Land"
at Camp Big Cove.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.024
( Christine inhales )

22:50.119 --> 22:54.658
Drinking wine in Central Park.
- ( laughing )

22:54.748 --> 22:58.036
Sun on your face,
just lying there.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.163
(laughing )

23:01.755 --> 23:03.711
That amusing, huh?

23:03.799 --> 23:08.668
No, no,
it's just... stupid.

23:10.014 --> 23:12.346
We were
at this summer camp

23:12.433 --> 23:13.548
up in the Sierras.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.258
l was nine.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.685
And there was
this performance on the last day.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.764
Talent show.
The whole camp watched.

23:23.694 --> 23:27.528
And l was supposed to sing
"This Land is Your Land."

23:28.949 --> 23:31.406
So, I get up
on stage...

23:33.078 --> 23:34.909
and the music starts.

23:34.997 --> 23:38.615
One of the counselors
playing on a Casio. (chuckles )

23:40.127 --> 23:42.539
And | freeze.
l...

23:42.630 --> 23:46.964
I can't remember
a single word.

23:47.051 --> 23:50.669
And I'm standing there
staring out at the audience...

23:52.514 --> 23:56.553
when | see Nick's face,
looking at me in horror

23:56.644 --> 24:00.387
like he's living it
with me or something.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.647
So, he runs up
on stage...

24:05.069 --> 24:09.108
but then he forgets
everything, too.

24:09.198 --> 24:12.361
So, he just
starts blasting,

24:12.451 --> 24:16.660
# This land is your land,
this land is your land

24:16.747 --> 24:19.784
# This land is your land...
over and over.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.287
(laughing )

24:22.378 --> 24:27.748
Like, after,
like, the 20th time,

24:27.800 --> 24:32.043
he... he takes
this giant bow

24:32.137 --> 24:35.129
and everyone applauds.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.589
( chuckles )

24:37.768 --> 24:39.679
It was
a standing ovation.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.019
Everybody loved Nick.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.812
You're close,
you and your brother?

24:51.907 --> 24:54.899
When we were kids.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.734
But it changed.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.955
I really looked up to him
when l was young.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.966
More than anyone.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.291
( music playing )

25:12.386 --> 25:14.502
More than my dad, even.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.784
No.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.411
Christine.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.584
Christine, wake up.

25:47.671 --> 25:50.048
Christine.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.168
Hey, Christine.

25:52.259 --> 25:54.045
Christine.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.340
No.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.797
The air in here.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.599
The air... no.

26:02.686 --> 26:07.396
(panﬁng)
No.No.No.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.494
( panting )

26:43.393 --> 26:45.475
( infected growling )

26:47.064 --> 26:48.929
( music playing )

26:51.693 --> 26:54.025
All right.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.819
- You know what you're doing, Nick?
- No idea.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.862
How do you turn
the rotors on?

26:57.950 --> 27:00.111
It's that one.
It's that one there! Nick.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.658
- Here?
That's it.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.406
(whirring )

27:06.875 --> 27:09.457
- All right!
- Yeah!

27:10.754 --> 27:12.585
( powers down )

27:14.133 --> 27:16.124
Of all the places
to die, Nick, huh?

27:16.218 --> 27:18.379
No, you're not dying here
'cause I'm not dying here.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.925
Troy:
This is it, Nick!

27:23.016 --> 27:26.053
- This is it.
( infected snarling )

27:27.813 --> 27:31.055
# This land is your land

27:31.150 --> 27:34.233
# This land is my land

27:34.319 --> 27:37.436
# From California

27:37.531 --> 27:40.398
# To New York Island

27:40.492 --> 27:43.029
# From
redwood forest

27:46.373 --> 27:49.331
# Gulf Stream waters

27:49.418 --> 27:54.253
# This land was made
for you and...

27:57.301 --> 27:59.542
( panting )

28:15.068 --> 28:16.399
( bucket clatters )
- Hey.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.818
( snarling )

28:26.580 --> 28:27.660
(grunts)

28:44.932 --> 28:47.344
( panting )

29:00.864 --> 29:03.480
( snarling )

29:13.335 --> 29:15.542
( both panting )

29:31.979 --> 29:34.095
- ( panting )
( infected snarling )

29:35.565 --> 29:36.520
( snarling )

29:46.493 --> 29:48.609
- Ofelia: There it is.
- ( grunts )

30:04.261 --> 30:06.252
Help me up there.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.433
Okay.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.978
(grunts)

30:23.280 --> 30:24.861
- Ofelia: Almost there.
- ( infected snarling )

30:28.452 --> 30:31.159
- ( cocks gun )
- Ofelia.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.747
(grunts)

30:32.831 --> 30:35.117
( screaming )

30:35.208 --> 30:37.540
- ( snarling )
- (screaming )

30:43.383 --> 30:45.294
(gun cocks)

30:45.385 --> 30:48.297
( high-pitched ringing )
- ( muffled sound echoing )

30:50.807 --> 30:52.923
( fan whirring )

30:59.983 --> 31:02.099
(gasps )
Come on.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.604
(grunts)

31:06.239 --> 31:08.321
(air whooshing )

31:16.625 --> 31:18.115
(gasps )

31:20.504 --> 31:23.712
(munching )

31:28.929 --> 31:31.420
- (grunts)
- ( growling)

31:33.183 --> 31:35.139
(grunts)

31:35.227 --> 31:37.559
( snarling )

31:44.778 --> 31:45.483
Shit!

31:45.654 --> 31:47.610
(grunts)

31:47.697 --> 31:49.198
(grunts)

31:50.242 --> 31:52.358
( panting )

31:52.452 --> 31:54.829
( infected snarling )

31:56.498 --> 31:59.114
( music playing )

32:01.086 --> 32:02.496
( snarling )

32:19.312 --> 32:20.438
( snarling )

32:32.534 --> 32:34.115
Come on.

32:37.414 --> 32:38.369
( clicks )

32:44.087 --> 32:45.247
( infected grow/s )

32:45.422 --> 32:46.537
Troy:
This is it!

32:46.631 --> 32:48.587
I saved one bullet.

32:48.675 --> 32:51.542
It's you or me.
You choose.

32:51.636 --> 32:55.379
- Go on.
( explosion )

32:55.474 --> 32:57.385
( explosion )

32:57.476 --> 32:59.262
( music playing )

32:59.352 --> 33:01.934
( infected snarling )

33:12.574 --> 33:15.190
(gun clicking )

33:15.285 --> 33:16.365
(grunts)

33:19.206 --> 33:20.571
(grunts)

33:21.708 --> 33:25.371
( music playing )

33:28.798 --> 33:30.459
( gunshots )

33:31.134 --> 33:33.295
Alicia, we're here.
Come on.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.631
- Mom?
- Victor: We don't have much time.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.966
- ( panting )
- Alicia?

33:38.058 --> 33:39.764
(gunshot)
- We gotta go.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.557
( infected growling )
- ( gun cocks )

33:44.105 --> 33:46.312
( gunshots )

33:46.483 --> 33:47.472
They're here.
We gotta go.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.853
( gunﬁre continues )

33:52.989 --> 33:54.490
( gunﬁre continues )

33:55.867 --> 33:57.107
Walker:
Madison, we gotta go.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.320
If we don’t go now,
we 7/ be trapped in here.

33:58.495 --> 33:59.985
She's coming.
Come on.

34:00.872 --> 34:01.577
I'm sorry.

34:01.748 --> 34:02.863
( flesh squelches )

34:06.253 --> 34:08.539
( gunﬁre continues )

34:29.568 --> 34:31.559
( insects chirping )

34:40.287 --> 34:42.152
Madison:
It could've worked.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.323
It really
could've worked.

34:51.923 --> 34:54.380
So you got to the fuel
reserves before we did.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.332
There was enough
to make an impact.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.168
And then some.

34:58.263 --> 35:01.596
We have enough fuel
to get us where we need to go.

35:01.641 --> 35:03.256
Where's that?

35:03.351 --> 35:05.808
Make the trading post
by nightfall, supply up.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.510
Dam by morning.

35:24.414 --> 35:25.995
Madison:
Did you tell her?

35:27.876 --> 35:29.741
Walker:
She's still in shock.

35:31.087 --> 35:32.952
Tell me what?

35:35.967 --> 35:39.551
Ofelia,
your father...

35:40.639 --> 35:42.755
He's alive, Ofelia.

35:44.184 --> 35:46.015
He's alive.

35:47.270 --> 35:50.012
He's asked us
to bring you to him.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.313
It's true.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.145
I saw him myself.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.647
- He thought you were dead.
- ( crying )

35:56.738 --> 35:58.649
He's desperate
to see you.

36:01.242 --> 36:02.743
(whispers )
Thank you.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.501
We need to move.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.871
The explosion's
already attracting more.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.937
( chattering )

36:55.839 --> 36:57.249
( kisses )

37:06.474 --> 37:07.429
Where's Jake?

37:10.562 --> 37:12.348
(sighs )

37:20.321 --> 37:22.027
( crying )

37:24.242 --> 37:25.903
How?

37:25.994 --> 37:29.236
- Nick: He was trying to stop this.
- How?

37:29.330 --> 37:31.070
Troy:
He got bit.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.874
I put him down.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.842
Where'd the horde
come from?

37:49.017 --> 37:52.259
Troy, uh...
saw it coming,

37:52.353 --> 37:55.436
came to warn us,
but it was too late.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.240
We're leaving soon.

38:08.328 --> 38:11.035
- We found Daniel at the dam.
- Stop. Just...

38:11.080 --> 38:15.323
- It's safe, it's supplied.
- Stop pretending any place is safe. It's not.

38:15.418 --> 38:18.410
We keep searching
for something that doesn't exist.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.791
We kill for it
and die for it.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.705
- Alicia.
- You know better than anyone.

38:22.759 --> 38:24.750
- Don't say otherwise.
- Kind of short on options.

38:24.844 --> 38:27.836
It doesn't mean
I have to choose that!

38:27.931 --> 38:30.138
The dam has water
and walls.

38:30.225 --> 38:31.965
It’s the best we’re gonna get.
- Walker: We should go.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.925
While there's
still sunlight.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.313
Where's the dam?

38:43.863 --> 38:45.694
- Madison: What?
- Show me on a map.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.818
It's close. We're gonna
be there by morning.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.316
No.

38:53.122 --> 38:53.986
I'm not going.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.869
Alicia, look,
you're in shock, okay?

38:56.960 --> 38:59.042
What you've
just been through?

38:59.128 --> 39:02.791
- I can't even ima...
- No, I'm not. I'm not in shock.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.457
I'm seeing things
more clearly now

39:05.552 --> 39:07.543
than I ever have.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.962
Your way doesn't work.
It won't ever work.

39:10.098 --> 39:12.430
- And I can't do it anymore.
- We're safer together.

39:12.517 --> 39:16.101
We die as quickly together
as we do apart.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.350
I need to find a way
to live for myself.

39:20.942 --> 39:23.058
And I can't do that
running in fear.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.403
I can't do that
with any of you.

39:29.242 --> 39:30.482
I can't just
let you walk...

39:30.577 --> 39:32.943
I'm not asking you, Mom.
I'm telling you.

39:35.456 --> 39:38.289
You can't force me
on that truck.

39:40.128 --> 39:43.461
With rations, a weapon,
I can survive.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.163
You know I can.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.468
- Where would you go?
- Jake showed me a place.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.045
I'll show you where it is.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.847
Butlneed
to go there alone.

40:02.692 --> 40:04.353
( engine starts )

40:16.956 --> 40:20.039
Why don't I follow her, make sure
she gets where she's going?

40:20.126 --> 40:22.538
No, I can't lose
both of you.

40:22.629 --> 40:25.496
Think of it as a scout. We'll see
what else might be out there.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.797
You'll know she's safe,
and I'll meet you back at the dam.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.465
You're not losing anyone.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.931
Take Troy.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.934
Walker won't
want him with us.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.883
He's a fighter.
You might need him.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.898
Promise me
you'll come back.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.313
Yeah.

40:44.359 --> 40:47.317
"This Land is Your Land”
playing

40:48.696 --> 40:52.314
( car door opens, closes )

40:52.408 --> 40:54.785
( car departs )

41:04.587 --> 41:06.794
# I roamed
and rambled

41:06.881 --> 41:09.042
# And I followed
my footsteps

41:09.133 --> 41:14.002
# To the sparkling sands
of her diamond deserts

41:14.097 --> 41:15.962
# All around me

41:16.057 --> 41:18.890
# A voice was sounding

41:18.977 --> 41:22.765
# This land was made
for you and me

41:25.024 --> 41:27.265
# When the sun
comes shining

41:27.360 --> 41:29.601
# Then I was strolling

41:29.696 --> 41:31.903
# And the Wheat ﬁelds
waving

41:31.990 --> 41:35.153
# And the dust clouds
rolling

41:35.243 --> 41:37.359
# The voice
was chanting

41:37.453 --> 41:40.445
# As the fog
was lifting

41:40.540 --> 41:44.624
# This land was made
for you and me

41:46.379 --> 41:48.290
# This land
is your land

41:48.381 --> 41:50.713
# And this land
is my land

41:50.800 --> 41:52.836
# From California

41:52.927 --> 41:55.088
# To the New York Island

41:55.179 --> 41:57.386
# From redwood forest

41:57.473 --> 42:00.306
# To the Gulf Stream
waters

42:00.393 --> 42:04.853
# This land was made
for you and me

42:04.939 --> 42:07.100
# When the sun
comes shining

42:07.191 --> 42:09.352
# Then I was strolling

42:09.444 --> 42:11.526
# And the Wheat ﬁelds
waving

42:11.612 --> 42:13.898
# And the dust clouds
rolling

42:13.990 --> 42:15.981
# The voice
come chanting

42:16.075 --> 42:19.067
# And the fog
was lifting

42:19.120 --> 42:22.612
# This land was made
for you and me.
