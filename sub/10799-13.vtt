<i>Stardate 43539.1.</i>

00:06.750 --> 00:09.250
<i>We have moved into orbit</i>

00:06.750 --> 00:09.250
<i>around Bre'el IV.</i>

00:09.291 --> 00:10.500
<i>With the assistance</i>

00:09.291 --> 00:10.500
<i>of the planet's</i>

00:10.542 --> 00:11.834
<i>emergency control center</i>

00:11.875 --> 00:13.291
<i>we are investigating</i>

00:13.333 --> 00:15.375
<i>a catastrophic threat</i>

00:13.333 --> 00:15.375
<i>to the population</i>

00:15.417 --> 00:17.500
<i>from a descending</i>

00:15.417 --> 00:17.500
<i>asteroidal moon.</i>

00:17.542 --> 00:19.375
(<i> console beeping</i> )

00:19.417 --> 00:20.667
The satellite's trajectory

00:20.709 --> 00:22.709
is continuing to

00:20.709 --> 00:22.709
deteriorate, Captain.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.500
This orbit will put it

00:22.750 --> 00:25.500
within 500 kilometers

00:25.542 --> 00:27.083
of the planet's surface.

00:27.125 --> 00:28.834
We are predicting

00:27.125 --> 00:28.834
the atmospheric drag

00:28.875 --> 00:31.250
will bring it down

00:28.875 --> 00:31.250
on the next orbit.

00:31.291 --> 00:34.542
Have you been able to find

00:31.291 --> 00:34.542
any explanation for this?

00:34.583 --> 00:38.041
No, Doctor. It is a most

00:34.583 --> 00:38.041
unusual phenomenon.

00:38.083 --> 00:40.041
Won't the moon disintegrate

00:38.083 --> 00:40.041
prior to impact?

00:40.083 --> 00:42.875
No. It has a ferrous

00:40.083 --> 00:42.875
crystalline structure

00:42.917 --> 00:46.917
and it will be

00:42.917 --> 00:46.917
able to withstand

00:42.917 --> 00:46.917
tidal forces, Captain.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.750
Could we blow it

00:46.959 --> 00:48.750
into pieces?

00:48.792 --> 00:51.625
The total mass of

00:48.792 --> 00:51.625
the moon would remain

00:48.792 --> 00:51.625
the same, Commander

00:51.667 --> 00:53.333
and the impact of

00:51.667 --> 00:53.333
thousands of fragments

00:53.375 --> 00:56.000
would spread destruction

00:53.375 --> 00:56.000
over an even wider area.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.875
How long before impact?

00:57.917 --> 00:59.375
29 hours, sir.

00:59.417 --> 01:01.875
Projecting it somewhere

00:59.417 --> 01:01.875
on the western continent.

01:01.917 --> 01:05.250
That would destroy an area

01:01.917 --> 01:05.250
800 kilometers in radius.

01:05.291 --> 01:08.125
That damage would be

01:05.291 --> 01:08.125
insignificant, Captain

01:08.166 --> 01:11.291
compared to the

01:08.166 --> 01:11.291
seismic repercussions

01:11.333 --> 01:15.792
massive landquakes

01:11.333 --> 01:15.792
and tsunami.

01:15.834 --> 01:18.291
The force would raise a cloud

01:15.834 --> 01:18.291
of dust around the planet

01:18.333 --> 01:20.917
leading to a significant

01:18.333 --> 01:20.917
temperature reduction.

01:20.959 --> 01:23.709
We could be looking

01:20.959 --> 01:23.709
at our own ice age.

01:28.875 --> 01:30.333
Mr. La Forge, is there any way

01:30.375 --> 01:33.000
that the<i> Enterprise</i>

01:30.375 --> 01:33.000
could coax that satellite

01:33.041 --> 01:34.458
back where it belongs?

01:34.500 --> 01:35.750
We'd need to apply a delta-v

01:35.792 --> 01:38.291
of about four kilometers

01:35.792 --> 01:38.291
per second.

01:38.333 --> 01:40.250
Even with warp power to the

01:38.333 --> 01:40.250
tractor beam, it would mean

01:40.291 --> 01:42.583
exceeding the recommended

01:40.291 --> 01:42.583
impulse engine output

01:42.625 --> 01:44.375
by at least 47%.

01:44.417 --> 01:45.417
It would be like

01:45.458 --> 01:47.083
an ant pushing a tricycle.

01:47.125 --> 01:48.792
A slim chance at best.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.250
Given the choice

01:48.834 --> 01:50.250
between slim and none

01:50.291 --> 01:52.000
I'll take slim any day.

01:52.041 --> 01:53.500
Make it so.

01:53.542 --> 01:55.625
Lieutenant Worf, contact

01:53.542 --> 01:55.625
all ships in this sector

01:55.667 --> 01:58.500
to rendezvous and join

01:55.667 --> 01:58.500
us in relief efforts.

01:58.542 --> 02:00.000
We'll keep you advised

01:58.542 --> 02:00.000
of our progress.

02:00.041 --> 02:01.458
Picard out.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.375
Can you give us

02:04.917 --> 02:06.375
any more, Geordi?

02:06.417 --> 02:08.166
Not without burning out

02:06.417 --> 02:08.166
the tractor beam emitter.

02:08.208 --> 02:11.375
The circuits are already

02:08.208 --> 02:11.375
beyond the thermal limit.

02:11.417 --> 02:14.375
Delta-v

02:11.417 --> 02:14.375
is 92 meters per second.

02:14.417 --> 02:16.041
The mass is too great.

02:16.083 --> 02:17.000
We are having an effect

02:17.041 --> 02:18.333
but it is

02:17.041 --> 02:18.333
negligible.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.792
We've done everything

04:52.542 --> 04:54.792
by the book and

04:52.542 --> 04:54.792
a little extra.

04:54.834 --> 04:58.166
We need more time or power,

04:54.834 --> 04:58.166
and we're short on both.

04:58.208 --> 04:59.500
I'll take a look and see

04:58.208 --> 04:59.500
if there are any rules

05:15.291 --> 05:17.875
does it give you to bring

05:15.291 --> 05:17.875
terror into their lives?

05:17.917 --> 05:19.083
Whose lives?

05:19.125 --> 05:20.750

05:20.792 --> 05:23.000
who are watching as their

05:23.041 --> 05:25.041
Oh, I haven't the vaguest idea

05:23.041 --> 05:25.041
what you're talking about

05:25.083 --> 05:27.542
and I have a much

05:25.083 --> 05:27.542
more serious problem.

05:27.583 --> 05:29.959
I'm no longer a member

05:27.583 --> 05:29.959

My superiors have

05:30.000 --> 05:32.500
decided to punish me.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.834
And punish us as

05:32.542 --> 05:34.834
well, it would seem.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.625
They say I've spread chaos

05:34.875 --> 05:37.625

05:37.667 --> 05:42.041
and they've stripped

05:37.667 --> 05:42.041
me of all my powers.

05:42.083 --> 05:43.875
You don't believe me, do you?

Do you think I would

05:43.917 --> 05:46.458
humiliate myself like this?

05:46.500 --> 05:48.583
If it served

05:46.500 --> 05:48.583
your purpose, yes.

05:48.625 --> 05:51.291
It's the truth.

lumpen human being.

06:00.917 --> 06:02.417
They made you human

06:02.458 --> 06:04.917

06:04.959 --> 06:06.750
No, it was my request.

06:06.792 --> 06:09.667
I could have chosen to exist

06:06.792 --> 06:09.667
as a Markoffian sea lizard

06:09.709 --> 06:11.166
or a Belzoidian flea.

06:11.208 --> 06:15.291
Anything I wished,

06:11.208 --> 06:15.291
as long as it was mortal.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.583
And since I had only

06:15.333 --> 06:17.583
a fraction of a second to mull

06:17.625 --> 06:19.375
I chose this

06:19.417 --> 06:21.333
and asked them

06:19.417 --> 06:21.333
to bring me here.

06:21.375 --> 06:22.542
Why?

06:22.583 --> 06:24.250
Because, in all the universe

06:24.291 --> 06:26.917

Forced to cover myself

07:45.875 --> 07:47.625
with a fabric

07:47.667 --> 07:50.208
because of some outdated

07:47.667 --> 07:50.208
human morality--

07:50.250 --> 07:53.125
to say nothing

07:50.250 --> 07:53.125
of being too hot or too cold--

Sorry.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.792
So, you understand, I could

08:22.291 --> 08:24.792
never survive in confinement.

08:24.834 --> 08:27.625
I mean, this is cruel

08:24.834 --> 08:27.625
and unusual punishment.

08:27.667 --> 08:30.083
The universe

08:27.667 --> 08:30.083
has been my backyard.

08:30.125 --> 08:32.625
As a fellow Klingon

08:32.667 --> 08:34.125
if you would speak to

08:32.667 --> 08:34.125
the Captain on my behalf

08:34.166 --> 08:36.417
I would be

08:34.166 --> 08:36.417
eternally grateful.

08:36.458 --> 08:38.625
Which doesn't

08:36.458 --> 08:38.625
mean as much as it

08:36.458 --> 08:38.625
used to, I admit.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.583
Be quiet!

08:40.625 --> 08:42.208
Or disappear back

08:40.625 --> 08:42.208
where you came from!

08:42.250 --> 08:43.917
I<i> can't</i> disappear

08:43.959 --> 08:46.500
any more than you could

08:43.959 --> 08:46.500
win a beauty contest.

08:49.917 --> 08:52.333
If I were to ask you

08:49.917 --> 08:52.333
a<i> very</i> simple question

08:52.375 --> 08:53.709
do you think you might

08:52.375 --> 08:53.709
be able to answer it

08:53.750 --> 08:56.667
without it troubling

08:53.750 --> 08:56.667
your intellect too much?

08:56.709 --> 08:57.667
Ready?

08:57.709 --> 08:59.125
Here goes.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.625
Would I permit you to

08:59.166 --> 09:00.625
lock me away if I still

09:00.667 --> 09:02.208
had all my powers?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.500
You have fooled us

09:02.250 --> 09:04.500
too often, Q.

09:04.542 --> 09:07.875
Oh, perspicacity incarnate.

09:07.917 --> 09:09.500
Please don't feel

09:07.917 --> 09:09.500
compelled now

09:09.542 --> 09:13.375
to tell me the story of

09:09.542 --> 09:13.375
the boy who cried "Worf."

09:13.417 --> 09:14.458
Computer...

09:14.500 --> 09:17.750
activate force field.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.041
I demand to be let out of here.

09:19.083 --> 09:20.500
Do you hear me?

09:20.542 --> 09:23.417
You will deactivate

09:20.542 --> 09:23.417
this cell immediately.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.667
Romulan!

09:27.709 --> 09:29.583
(<i> growls quietly</i> )

09:29.625 --> 09:33.500
I should have said Romulan--

09:29.625 --> 09:33.500
that Klingon goat.

09:33.542 --> 09:34.875
The question is

09:34.917 --> 09:38.291
what sort of jaded game

09:34.917 --> 09:38.291
is he up to this time?

09:38.333 --> 09:39.792
Maybe he just

09:38.333 --> 09:39.792
wants a big laugh.

09:39.834 --> 09:41.375
He'll take Bre'el IV

09:39.834 --> 09:41.375
to the edge of disaster

09:41.417 --> 09:45.333
and then pull

09:41.417 --> 09:45.333
the moon back.

09:45.375 --> 09:48.667
Or he may have nothing

09:45.375 --> 09:48.667
to do with it at all.

09:48.709 --> 09:50.583
You honestly think Q

09:48.709 --> 09:50.583
is telling the truth?

09:50.625 --> 09:52.000
Oh, I agree this

09:50.625 --> 09:52.000
is highly unlikely

09:52.041 --> 09:54.041
but we have to proceed

09:52.041 --> 09:54.041
with our current dilemma

09:54.083 --> 09:56.208
as though Q is powerless

09:54.083 --> 09:56.208
to prevent it, don't we?

09:56.250 --> 09:57.834
And there he sits and

09:56.250 --> 09:57.834
he watches us struggle.

09:57.875 --> 09:59.792
I don't see that we

09:57.875 --> 09:59.792
have any choice.

09:59.834 --> 10:04.125
Mr. Worf, will you hail the

09:59.834 --> 10:04.125
Bre'el IV science station?

10:04.166 --> 10:05.792
They're standing by, Captain.

10:08.625 --> 10:10.250
BRE'EL DOCTOR:

10:08.625 --> 10:10.250
Yes, Captain Picard?

10:10.291 --> 10:12.875
I'm sorry, but I have to report

10:10.291 --> 10:12.875
that our first attempt

10:12.917 --> 10:14.834
to restore the moon

10:12.917 --> 10:14.834
to its proper orbit

10:14.875 --> 10:16.417
has failed.

10:16.458 --> 10:20.667
(<i> sighs</i> )

10:20.709 --> 10:24.375
We have less than 25 hours

10:20.709 --> 10:24.375
before impact, Captain.

10:24.417 --> 10:25.583
Our Chief Engineer

10:24.417 --> 10:25.583
is working on ways

10:25.625 --> 10:27.291
to reinforce

10:25.625 --> 10:27.291
the tractor beam.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.166
So, there is a hope

10:29.208 --> 10:31.333
but if you have

10:29.208 --> 10:31.333
an evacuation plan...

10:31.375 --> 10:33.000
We have already

10:31.375 --> 10:33.000
started moving people

10:33.041 --> 10:35.792
from the coastal areas

10:33.041 --> 10:35.792
of the western continent.

10:35.834 --> 10:38.041
We are going to make

10:35.834 --> 10:38.041
another attempt shortly.

10:38.083 --> 10:40.333
Picard, out.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.417
I've got to tell you, Geordi

10:40.375 --> 10:42.417
is not at all optimistic.

10:44.458 --> 10:46.000
What the devil...?

10:47.250 --> 10:49.542
Data?

10:49.583 --> 10:52.166
Sensors are showing

10:49.583 --> 10:52.166
broadband emissions

10:52.208 --> 10:53.542
including berthold rays.

10:53.583 --> 10:55.083
Lethal?

10:55.125 --> 10:58.208
No, Commander, overall exposure

10:55.125 --> 10:58.208
is less than 75 rems.

10:58.250 --> 10:59.291
Very low intensity.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.417
More like a soft

10:59.333 --> 11:01.417
medical scan.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.500
I would speculate

11:01.458 --> 11:03.500
we are being probed.

11:03.542 --> 11:05.250
By whom?

11:05.291 --> 11:07.959
Sensors cannot identify

11:05.291 --> 11:07.959
the point of origin.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.583
It seems to be coming

11:08.000 --> 11:09.583
from all around us.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.458
Ah, you've come

11:35.083 --> 11:36.458
to apologize.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.000
How nice.

11:38.041 --> 11:39.208
All is forgiven.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.250
No offense taken.

11:40.291 --> 11:41.208
Enough.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.417
Q, what exactly is going on?

11:43.458 --> 11:45.333
Oh, but how can I know

11:43.458 --> 11:45.333
what's going on?

11:45.375 --> 11:47.625
I've been in this dungeon

11:45.375 --> 11:47.625
of yours--

11:47.667 --> 11:51.834
alone, helpless, bored to tears.

11:51.875 --> 11:55.041
We have a moon, inexplicably

11:51.875 --> 11:55.041
falling out of orbit

11:55.083 --> 11:58.959
and just now this ship was

11:55.083 --> 11:58.959
probed with berthold radiation.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.375
I wasn't aware of this.

12:02.125 --> 12:04.125
Truthfully, Jean-Luc.

12:04.166 --> 12:06.000
I've been entirely preoccupied

12:06.041 --> 12:09.375
by a most frightening

12:06.041 --> 12:09.375
experience of my own.

12:09.417 --> 12:13.500
A couple of hours ago,

12:09.417 --> 12:13.500
I realized that my body

12:13.542 --> 12:15.750
was no longer

12:13.542 --> 12:15.750
functioning properly.

12:15.792 --> 12:17.250
I felt weak.

12:17.291 --> 12:19.333
I could

12:17.291 --> 12:19.333
no longer stand.

12:19.375 --> 12:20.917
The life was oozing out of me.

12:20.959 --> 12:23.041
I lost consciousness.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.458
You fell asleep.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.166
Oh-- terrifying.

12:27.208 --> 12:29.917
How can you stand it

12:27.208 --> 12:29.917
day after day?

12:29.959 --> 12:30.917
You get used to it.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.000
What other dangers

12:32.041 --> 12:33.667
await me?

12:33.709 --> 12:34.959
I'm not prepared for this.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.208
I need guidance.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.542
Q, I'm not going

12:36.250 --> 12:38.542
to play along with this.

12:38.583 --> 12:42.125
If you want to continue this

12:38.583 --> 12:42.125
charade, you can do it alone.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.458
Jean-Luc, wait.

12:44.500 --> 12:48.917
This is getting on my nerves,

12:44.500 --> 12:48.917
now that I have them.

12:48.959 --> 12:52.041
You have a moon in a

12:48.959 --> 12:52.041
deteriorating orbit.

12:52.083 --> 12:54.250
I've known moons

12:52.083 --> 12:54.250
through the universe--

12:54.291 --> 12:56.208
big ones, small ones.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.875
I'm an expert.

12:57.917 --> 13:01.625
I could help you with this one--

12:57.917 --> 13:01.625
if you let me out of here.

13:01.667 --> 13:05.375
Q, there are millions

13:01.667 --> 13:05.375
of lives at risk.

13:05.417 --> 13:06.542
If you have the power...

13:06.583 --> 13:09.417
I<i> don't</i> have any powers.

13:09.458 --> 13:13.250
But I have the knowledge

13:09.458 --> 13:13.250
locked up in this puny brain.

13:15.709 --> 13:18.333
You cannot afford to not take

13:15.709 --> 13:18.333
that advantage, can you?

13:21.875 --> 13:24.875
Mr. Data, report

13:21.875 --> 13:24.875
to Detention Cell Three.

13:24.917 --> 13:27.000
On my way, sir.

13:27.041 --> 13:30.166
(<i> sighs</i> )

13:30.208 --> 13:31.750
Computer, remove

13:30.208 --> 13:31.750
the force field.

13:33.625 --> 13:34.834
If you are human--

13:34.875 --> 13:36.667
which I seriously doubt--

13:36.709 --> 13:39.709
you will have to work hard

13:36.709 --> 13:39.709
to earn our trust.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.709
I'm not worried

13:39.750 --> 13:41.709
about that, Jean-Luc.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.375
You only dislike me.

13:43.417 --> 13:45.959
There are others in the

13:43.417 --> 13:45.959
cosmos who truly despise me.

13:48.917 --> 13:51.625
Mr. Data, you are hereby

13:48.917 --> 13:51.625
assigned to Q

13:51.667 --> 13:54.750
for the remainder

13:51.667 --> 13:54.750
of his stay.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.959
You will escort him

13:54.792 --> 13:56.959
to Mr. La Forge in Engineering.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.125
Aye, sir.

13:58.166 --> 13:59.917
Can I have a

13:58.166 --> 13:59.917
Starfleet uniform?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.083
What are<i> you</i>

14:03.000 --> 14:05.083
looking at?

14:05.125 --> 14:06.333
I was considering

14:05.125 --> 14:06.333
the possibility

14:06.375 --> 14:08.208
that you are

14:06.375 --> 14:08.208
telling the truth--

14:08.250 --> 14:09.750
that you really are human.

14:09.792 --> 14:11.959
It's the ghastly

14:09.792 --> 14:11.959
truth, Mr. Data.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.250
I can now stub my toe

14:12.000 --> 14:14.250
with the best of them.

14:14.291 --> 14:15.625
An irony.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.542
It means that you have achieved

14:15.667 --> 14:17.542
in disgrace

14:17.583 --> 14:20.125
what I have always aspired

14:17.583 --> 14:20.125
to be.

14:29.417 --> 14:32.625
Humans are such

14:29.417 --> 14:32.625
commonplace

14:29.417 --> 14:32.625
little creatures.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.083
They roam the galaxy

14:32.667 --> 14:34.083
searching for something,

14:34.125 --> 14:35.959
they know not what.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
The human race has

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
an enduring desire

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
for knowledge

14:39.041 --> 14:40.750
and for new opportunities

14:39.041 --> 14:40.750
to improve itself.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.750
Well, there's certainly

14:40.792 --> 14:42.750
room for improvement

14:42.792 --> 14:45.959
but the truth is, Data,

14:42.792 --> 14:45.959
they are a minor species

14:42.792 --> 14:45.959
in the grand scheme--

14:46.000 --> 14:47.625
not worth your envy.

14:47.667 --> 14:48.792
Oh, I do not feel envy.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.166
Well, that's good.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.625
I feel nothing at all.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.583
That is part

14:52.667 --> 14:54.583
of my dilemma.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.542
I have the curiosity

14:54.625 --> 14:56.542
of humans

14:56.583 --> 14:57.834
but there are questions

14:57.875 --> 14:59.667
that I will never

14:57.875 --> 14:59.667
have the answers to--

14:59.709 --> 15:02.792
what it is like

14:59.709 --> 15:02.792
to laugh or... or cry

15:02.834 --> 15:04.959
or to experience

15:02.834 --> 15:04.959
any human emotions.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.500
Hmm.

15:06.542 --> 15:08.375
Well, if you ask me,

15:06.542 --> 15:08.375
these human emotions

15:08.417 --> 15:10.583
are not what they're

15:08.417 --> 15:10.583
cracked up to be.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.417
Hmm.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.959
The moon will hit

15:12.458 --> 15:14.959
its perigee in ten hours.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.583
Now, we match its trajectory,

15:15.000 --> 15:18.583
increase emitter coolant rate

15:18.625 --> 15:21.250
so that we can apply continuous

15:18.625 --> 15:21.250
warp-equivalent power nine

15:21.291 --> 15:22.667
to the tractor beam.

15:22.709 --> 15:24.625
We can push it

15:22.709 --> 15:24.625
for nearly seven hours

15:24.667 --> 15:27.417
and I<i> think</i>

15:24.667 --> 15:27.417
that just might do it.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.500
But there's a problem.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.083
The<i> Enterprise</i> will be

15:29.542 --> 15:31.083
dangerously close

15:31.125 --> 15:32.583
to the atmosphere.

15:32.625 --> 15:33.625
That's the problem.

15:33.667 --> 15:34.834
This is incredible.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.250
You see something here, Q?

15:36.291 --> 15:38.333
I think I just

15:36.291 --> 15:38.333
hurt my back.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.250
I'm feeling pain.

15:40.291 --> 15:41.917
I don't like it.

15:41.959 --> 15:43.333
What's the right

15:41.959 --> 15:43.333
thing to say?

15:43.375 --> 15:44.667
"Ow"?

15:44.709 --> 15:45.750
Ow.

15:45.792 --> 15:47.375
Ow!

15:47.417 --> 15:49.458
I can't

15:47.417 --> 15:49.458
straighten up.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.250
Medical assistance

15:49.500 --> 15:51.250
to Engineering.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.125
Q, I've got a few people

15:51.291 --> 15:53.125
down on Bre'el IV

15:53.166 --> 15:54.875
who are going to be hurt...

15:53.166 --> 15:54.875
Yes, yes, yes.

15:54.917 --> 15:57.417
Your marvelous plan will not

15:54.917 --> 15:57.417
only tear the moon to pieces

15:57.458 --> 15:59.083
but your precious ship as well.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.875
You got a better idea?

16:00.917 --> 16:03.542
Well, I would certainly begin

16:00.917 --> 16:03.542
by examining the cause

16:03.583 --> 16:05.083
and not the symptom.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.959
We've already done that, Q,

16:05.125 --> 16:06.959
and there's no way to...

16:07.000 --> 16:08.291
This is

16:07.000 --> 16:08.291
obviously

16:08.333 --> 16:09.959
the result of a large

16:08.333 --> 16:09.959
celestial object

16:10.000 --> 16:11.542
passing through

16:10.000 --> 16:11.542
at near right angles

16:11.583 --> 16:13.625
to the plane

16:11.583 --> 16:13.625
of the star system--

16:13.667 --> 16:15.041
probably a black hole.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.041
DATA:

16:15.083 --> 16:16.041
Can you recommend

16:16.083 --> 16:17.792
a way to counter

16:16.083 --> 16:17.792
the effect?

16:17.834 --> 16:20.959
Simple. Change the

16:17.834 --> 16:20.959
gravitational constant

16:17.834 --> 16:20.959
of the universe.

16:21.041 --> 16:22.375
What?

16:22.417 --> 16:24.291
Change the gravitational

16:22.417 --> 16:24.291
constant of the universe

16:24.333 --> 16:26.542
thereby altering the

16:24.333 --> 16:26.542
mass of the asteroid.

16:26.583 --> 16:27.750
Redefine gravity.

16:27.792 --> 16:29.250
And how am I supposed

16:27.792 --> 16:29.250
to do that?

16:29.291 --> 16:30.500
You just do it.

16:30.542 --> 16:33.125
Oh! Where's that

16:30.542 --> 16:33.125
doctor, anyway?

16:33.166 --> 16:34.667
Geordi is trying to say

16:34.709 --> 16:36.875
that changing the gravitational

16:34.709 --> 16:36.875
constant of the universe

16:36.917 --> 16:38.375
is beyond our capabilities.

16:38.417 --> 16:40.500
Oh.

16:40.542 --> 16:44.375
Well, in that case,

16:40.542 --> 16:44.375
never mind.

16:44.417 --> 16:47.458
Ah, Dr. Crusher.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.500
I see Starfleet

16:47.500 --> 16:50.500
has shipped you

16:47.500 --> 16:50.500
back into exile.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.709
Q says he has

16:50.542 --> 16:52.709
hurt his back.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.333
Uh-huh.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.041
Well, if I didn't see it

16:59.792 --> 17:01.041
with my own eyes

17:01.083 --> 17:02.959
I wouldn't believe it.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.834
According to this,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.834
he has classic back trauma--

17:05.875 --> 17:08.083
muscle spasms.

17:08.125 --> 17:09.875
I've been under a lot

17:08.125 --> 17:09.875
of pressure lately.

17:09.917 --> 17:11.333
Family problems.

17:11.375 --> 17:13.500
Mm. Well, don't expect

17:11.375 --> 17:13.500
too much sympathy from me.

17:13.542 --> 17:15.917
You have been a pain

17:13.542 --> 17:15.917
in our backside often enough.

17:15.959 --> 17:18.208
Ah! Oh.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.500
Your bedside manner

17:18.250 --> 17:20.500
is admirable, Doctor.

17:20.542 --> 17:22.625
I'm sure your patients

17:20.542 --> 17:22.625
recover quickly...

17:22.667 --> 17:24.375
just to get away from you.

17:24.417 --> 17:26.208
Oh!

17:26.250 --> 17:27.792
You know, this might work.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.083
We can't change

17:29.125 --> 17:30.709
the gravitational

17:29.125 --> 17:30.709
constant of the universe

17:30.750 --> 17:32.583
but if we wrap a low-level

17:30.750 --> 17:32.583
warp field around that moon

17:32.625 --> 17:35.208
we could reduce<i> its</i>

17:32.625 --> 17:35.208
gravitational constant--

17:35.250 --> 17:38.166
make it lighter,

17:35.250 --> 17:38.166
so we<i> can</i> push it.

17:38.208 --> 17:40.542
Glad I could help.

17:40.583 --> 17:43.458
Ow... I think.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.875
Now what?

17:45.917 --> 17:48.041
There's something wrong

17:45.917 --> 17:48.041
with my stomach.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.583
It hurts?

17:49.625 --> 17:52.041
It's making noises.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.875
Maybe you're hungry.

18:00.041 --> 18:01.000
I've never eaten before.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.667
What do I ask for?

18:02.709 --> 18:05.375
The choice of meal

18:02.709 --> 18:05.375
is determined by

18:02.709 --> 18:05.375
individual taste.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.125
What do you like?

18:07.166 --> 18:09.417
Although I do not

18:07.166 --> 18:09.417
require sustenance

18:09.458 --> 18:12.667
I occasionally

18:09.458 --> 18:12.667
ingest semi-organic

18:09.458 --> 18:12.667
nutrient suspension

18:12.709 --> 18:15.041
in a silicon-based

18:12.709 --> 18:15.041
liquid medium.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.709
Is it good?

18:16.750 --> 18:18.417
It would be more

18:16.750 --> 18:18.417
appropriate to say

18:18.458 --> 18:20.000
it is good for<i> me</i>

18:20.041 --> 18:22.000
as it lubricates

18:20.041 --> 18:22.000
my bio-functions.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.208
That doesn't sound

18:22.041 --> 18:23.208
very appealing.

18:23.250 --> 18:24.458
What else is there?

18:24.500 --> 18:26.375
A wide variety of items.

18:26.417 --> 18:29.625
The replicator can make

18:26.417 --> 18:29.625
anything you desire.

18:29.667 --> 18:33.291
How do I know

18:29.667 --> 18:33.291
what I desire?

18:33.333 --> 18:36.875
I have observed that

18:33.333 --> 18:36.875
the selection of food

18:36.917 --> 18:38.166
is often influenced

18:38.208 --> 18:40.250
by the mood of the

18:38.208 --> 18:40.250
person ordering.

18:40.291 --> 18:41.583
I'm in a dreadful mood.

18:41.625 --> 18:44.125
Get me something

18:41.625 --> 18:44.125
appropriate.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.375
When Counselor Troi

18:44.166 --> 18:46.375
is unhappy

18:46.417 --> 18:48.250
she usually eats

18:46.417 --> 18:48.250
something chocolate.

18:50.625 --> 18:51.625
Chocolate?

18:51.667 --> 18:52.750
Mm-hmm.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.875
A chocolate sundae,

18:52.792 --> 18:54.875
for example.

18:54.917 --> 18:57.375
Although I do not speak

18:54.917 --> 18:57.375
from personal experience

18:57.417 --> 19:02.417
I have seen it have a

18:57.417 --> 19:02.417
profound psychological impact.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.834
I'll have ten

19:02.458 --> 19:04.834
chocolate sundaes.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.333
Ten?

19:06.375 --> 19:07.500
I have never

19:06.375 --> 19:07.500
seen anyone eat

19:07.542 --> 19:09.750
<i>ten</i> chocolate

19:07.542 --> 19:09.750
sundaes.

19:09.792 --> 19:11.792
I'm in a really bad mood.

19:11.834 --> 19:15.291
And since I've never

19:11.834 --> 19:15.291
eaten before, I should

19:11.834 --> 19:15.291
be... very hungry.

19:17.166 --> 19:19.959
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

19:20.000 --> 19:22.083
This is not a moment

19:20.000 --> 19:22.083
I've been looking forward to.

19:32.667 --> 19:36.041
I hear they drummed you

19:32.667 --> 19:36.041
out of the Continuum.

19:36.083 --> 19:39.709
I like to think of it

19:36.083 --> 19:39.709
as a significant career change.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.458
Just one of the boys, eh?

19:41.500 --> 19:42.583
One of the boys

19:42.625 --> 19:46.375
with an IQ of 2,005.

19:46.417 --> 19:48.291
The Captain and many of the

19:46.417 --> 19:48.291
crew are not yet convinced

19:48.333 --> 19:51.500
he is truly human.

19:51.542 --> 19:53.125
Really?

19:59.709 --> 20:01.375
(<i> yells in pain</i> )

20:01.417 --> 20:05.000
Seems human enough

20:01.417 --> 20:05.000
to me.

20:05.041 --> 20:06.417
This is

20:05.041 --> 20:06.417
a dangerous creature.

20:06.458 --> 20:07.875
You have no idea.

20:07.917 --> 20:09.250
Why Picard would make her

20:07.917 --> 20:09.250
a member of the crew

20:09.291 --> 20:11.125
and not me...

20:11.166 --> 20:14.625
It must be terribly

20:11.166 --> 20:14.625
frightening for you to

20:11.166 --> 20:14.625
be totally defenseless

20:14.667 --> 20:18.208
after all of those centuries

20:14.667 --> 20:18.208
of being omnipotent.

20:18.250 --> 20:21.000
I'm warning you, I still

20:18.250 --> 20:21.000
have friends in high places.

20:21.041 --> 20:23.125
Frightening one race

20:21.041 --> 20:23.125
after the other

20:23.166 --> 20:25.375
teasing them like

20:23.166 --> 20:25.375
frightened animals

20:25.417 --> 20:29.500
and you enjoying every moment

20:25.417 --> 20:29.500
of your victims' fears.

20:29.542 --> 20:33.083
From now on, I'll do

20:29.542 --> 20:33.083
missionary work, okay?

20:33.125 --> 20:35.500
That would be a most

20:33.125 --> 20:35.500
noble cause, Q.

20:35.542 --> 20:37.125
You could learn a lot

20:35.542 --> 20:37.125
from this one.

20:37.166 --> 20:40.375
Sure-- the robot who teaches

20:37.166 --> 20:40.375
the course in humanities.

20:40.417 --> 20:42.417
I am an android,

20:40.417 --> 20:42.417
not a robot.

20:42.458 --> 20:43.583
I beg your pardon.

20:43.625 --> 20:44.792
I'd enjoy that.

20:44.834 --> 20:45.959
And you better get used to it.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
What?

20:47.041 --> 20:48.166
Begging.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.917
You're a pitiful excuse

20:48.208 --> 20:49.917
for a human.

20:49.959 --> 20:51.166
The only way

20:49.959 --> 20:51.166
you're going to survive

20:51.208 --> 20:52.458
is on the charity

20:51.208 --> 20:52.458

22:55.125 --> 22:57.208
<i>from an attack</i>

22:57.250 --> 23:00.166
<i>by an alien species</i>

22:57.250 --> 23:00.166
<i>known as the Calamarain.</i>

23:00.208 --> 23:03.166
<i>They apparently</i>

23:00.208 --> 23:03.166
<i>have a grievance with Q--</i>

23:03.208 --> 23:06.250
<i>no doubt one of many</i>

23:03.208 --> 23:06.250
<i>life-forms that do.</i>

23:06.291 --> 23:09.625
The, uh, Calamarain are not

23:06.291 --> 23:09.625
very hospitable creatures.

23:09.667 --> 23:12.709
They exist as swirls

23:09.667 --> 23:12.709
of ionized gas.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.959
What did you

23:12.750 --> 23:14.959
do to them, Q?

23:15.000 --> 23:17.709
Oh, nothing bizarre.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.333
Nothing grotesque.

23:19.375 --> 23:21.458
You tormented them.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.583
A subjective term, Riker.

23:23.625 --> 23:26.458
One creature's torment is

23:23.625 --> 23:26.458
another creature's delight.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.583
They simply have

23:26.500 --> 23:28.583
no sense of humor.

23:28.625 --> 23:32.709
A character flaw with which you

23:28.625 --> 23:32.709
can... personally identify.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.375
I say we turn him over to them.

23:34.417 --> 23:35.625
Oh, well, I take it back.

23:35.667 --> 23:36.875
You do you have

23:35.667 --> 23:36.875
a sense of humor--

23:36.917 --> 23:38.750
a dreadful one at that.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.250
I'm serious.

23:40.291 --> 23:41.583
Of course.

23:41.625 --> 23:45.083
You knew this would happen,

23:41.625 --> 23:45.083
didn't you?

23:45.125 --> 23:47.125
One can never anticipate

23:45.125 --> 23:47.125
the Calamarain.

23:47.166 --> 23:50.166
They're very intelligent,

23:47.166 --> 23:50.166
but very flighty.

23:50.208 --> 23:51.709
Yes, but you

23:50.208 --> 23:51.709
must have

23:51.750 --> 23:53.917
so many enemies.

23:53.959 --> 23:57.625
Certainly you knew

23:53.959 --> 23:57.625
that if once you became mortal

23:57.667 --> 24:01.000
some of them might look you up.

24:01.041 --> 24:02.250
It had occurred to me.

24:02.291 --> 24:03.625
Mm-hmm.

24:03.667 --> 24:05.500
And for all your protestations

24:03.667 --> 24:05.500
of "friendship"

24:05.542 --> 24:09.667
your real reason

24:05.542 --> 24:09.667
for being here is protection.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.834
(<i> chuckles</i> )

24:11.875 --> 24:14.250
You're very smart, Jean-Luc.

24:14.291 --> 24:16.458
But I know human beings.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.583
They're all sopping over

24:17.625 --> 24:20.166
with compassion

24:17.625 --> 24:20.166
and forgiveness.

24:20.208 --> 24:24.792
They can't wait

24:20.208 --> 24:24.792
to absolve almost any offense.

24:24.834 --> 24:26.750
It's an inherent weakness

24:24.834 --> 24:26.750
of the breed.

24:26.792 --> 24:28.834
On the contrary,

24:26.792 --> 24:28.834
it is a strength.

24:28.875 --> 24:32.041
You call it what you will,

24:28.875 --> 24:32.041
but I think you'll protect me

24:32.083 --> 24:34.500
even though I've tormented you

24:32.083 --> 24:34.500
now and again.

24:34.542 --> 24:36.500
Fighting off all the species

24:34.542 --> 24:36.500
which you have insulted

24:36.542 --> 24:38.000
would be a full-time mission.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.834
That's not the one

24:38.041 --> 24:39.834
I signed up for.

24:39.875 --> 24:41.667
Indeed.

24:41.709 --> 24:44.291
Human or not,

24:41.709 --> 24:44.291
I want no part of you.

24:44.333 --> 24:46.250
We will deposit you

24:44.333 --> 24:46.250
at the first starbase.

24:46.291 --> 24:47.834
Let them deal with you.

24:47.875 --> 24:50.625
Uh-uh, but I could be

24:47.875 --> 24:50.625
a valuable member of the team.

24:50.667 --> 24:51.625
I'm human.

24:51.667 --> 24:53.083
I can learn.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.000
He has provided important

24:53.125 --> 24:55.000
theoretical guidance

24:55.041 --> 24:58.000
for Geordi's analysis of the

24:55.041 --> 24:58.000
Bre'el satellite, Captain.

24:58.041 --> 25:01.166
It seems you have

24:58.041 --> 25:01.166
an advocate, Q.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.000
I am merely stating the fact,

25:01.208 --> 25:03.000
Counselor.

25:04.834 --> 25:06.667
Mr. La Forge, your status?

25:06.709 --> 25:08.166
I've been putting together

25:06.709 --> 25:08.166
a program

25:08.208 --> 25:10.709
to extend the forward lobe

25:08.208 --> 25:10.709
of the warp field.

25:10.750 --> 25:13.458
The field coils aren't designed

25:10.750 --> 25:13.458
to envelope such a large volume

25:13.500 --> 25:16.083
but I'm attempting to modify

25:13.500 --> 25:16.083
their alignment parameters.

25:16.125 --> 25:18.875
DATA:

25:16.125 --> 25:18.875
Maintaining field integrity

25:16.125 --> 25:18.875
will be difficult, Geordi.

25:18.917 --> 25:21.375
Well, I'm pretty sure

25:18.917 --> 25:21.375
that we can do it manually.

25:21.417 --> 25:25.041
The moon will come

25:21.417 --> 25:25.041
to its perigee in 14 minutes.

25:25.083 --> 25:28.208
Mr. Data, you will escort Q

25:25.083 --> 25:28.208
to Engineering.

25:28.250 --> 25:30.166
You will assist Mr. La Forge.

25:30.208 --> 25:33.458
Mr. Worf, hail the Bre'el IV

25:30.208 --> 25:33.458
science station.

25:33.500 --> 25:34.625
Aye, sir.

25:38.208 --> 25:40.917
Picard thinks I can't cut it

25:38.208 --> 25:40.917
on his starship.

25:40.959 --> 25:42.000
I can do anything

25:42.041 --> 25:44.083
his little trained

25:42.041 --> 25:44.083
minions can do.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.834
I do not perceive your

25:44.125 --> 25:46.834
skills to be in doubt, Q.

25:46.875 --> 25:48.875
The Captain is merely

25:46.875 --> 25:48.875
concerned with your ability

25:48.917 --> 25:52.875
to successfully interact with

25:48.917 --> 25:52.875
"his little trained minions."

25:52.917 --> 25:56.583
Human interpersonal

25:52.917 --> 25:56.583
relationships are

25:52.917 --> 25:56.583
more complex.

25:56.625 --> 26:00.125
Your experience may not have

25:56.625 --> 26:00.125
adequately prepared you.

26:00.166 --> 26:03.291
I'm not interested in human

26:00.166 --> 26:03.291
interpersonal relationships.

26:03.333 --> 26:05.458
I just want to prove to Picard

26:03.333 --> 26:05.458
that I'm indispensable.

26:09.166 --> 26:11.083
Engineering.

26:11.125 --> 26:14.834
To function aboard

26:11.125 --> 26:14.834
a starship, or in

26:11.125 --> 26:14.834
any human activity

26:14.875 --> 26:17.208
you must learn to

26:14.875 --> 26:17.208
form relationships.

26:17.250 --> 26:19.333
(<i> sighing</i> ):

26:17.250 --> 26:19.333
It's so hard.

26:19.375 --> 26:20.917
And of more

26:19.375 --> 26:20.917
immediate importance

26:20.959 --> 26:23.417
is your ability

26:20.959 --> 26:23.417
to work within groups.

26:23.458 --> 26:26.041
I'm not good in groups.

26:26.083 --> 26:27.250
It's difficult

26:26.083 --> 26:27.250
to work in a group

26:27.291 --> 26:28.792
when you're omnipotent.

26:31.375 --> 26:34.041
The tides reached 10 meters

26:31.375 --> 26:34.041
on the last orbit.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.625
They are already beginning

26:34.083 --> 26:36.625
to swell again.

26:36.667 --> 26:40.000
We have a lot of frightened

26:36.667 --> 26:40.000
people down here, Captain.

26:40.041 --> 26:42.375
Your moon has begun moving

26:40.041 --> 26:42.375
towards its perigee.

26:42.417 --> 26:44.041
We're preparing

26:42.417 --> 26:44.041
to make our attempt.

26:44.083 --> 26:47.250
Our population has

26:44.083 --> 26:47.250
already taken shelter

26:47.291 --> 26:51.125
but I'm afraid no shelter

26:47.291 --> 26:51.125
will be adequate if you fail

26:51.166 --> 26:55.583
especially for the people

26:51.166 --> 26:55.583
on the western continent.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.291
Whatever the results

26:57.333 --> 27:01.375
we know you've

26:57.333 --> 27:01.375
done your best, Picard.

27:01.417 --> 27:03.417
It's appreciated.

27:03.458 --> 27:05.000
We'll keep you advised, Doctor.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.000
Picard out.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.417
Captain, sensors are picking up

27:07.458 --> 27:10.542
an increased energy output

27:07.458 --> 27:10.542
from the Calamarain.

27:10.583 --> 27:12.500
La Forge to Bridge.

27:12.542 --> 27:15.625
The moon has reached

27:12.542 --> 27:15.625
its minimum orbital distance.

27:15.667 --> 27:16.959
It's time, Captain.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.375
We'll have

27:17.000 --> 27:18.375
to lower shields.

27:18.417 --> 27:19.959
Proceed.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.208
Mr. Worf, keep a close eye

27:20.000 --> 27:23.208
on Q's friends out there.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.625
Understood.

27:28.166 --> 27:30.375
All right, everyone, this is

27:28.166 --> 27:30.375
what we're going to be doing...

27:30.417 --> 27:31.834
Q, everybody already knows

27:31.875 --> 27:33.583
what they're going to do,

27:31.875 --> 27:33.583
except for you.

27:33.625 --> 27:34.750
Now, here's

27:33.625 --> 27:34.750
what I need...

27:34.792 --> 27:36.208
La Forge, obviously,

27:34.792 --> 27:36.208
my knowledge

27:36.250 --> 27:38.000
and experience

27:36.250 --> 27:38.000
far exceeds yours

27:38.041 --> 27:40.583
by about a billion times.

27:40.625 --> 27:43.250
So, if you'll just step

27:40.625 --> 27:43.250
aside gracefully.

27:43.291 --> 27:45.792
Q, Your experience will

27:43.291 --> 27:45.792
be most valuable to me

27:45.834 --> 27:47.792
if you can manually

27:45.834 --> 27:47.792
control the field integrity.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.041
Don't be foolish.

27:49.083 --> 27:50.667
That would be a waste

27:49.083 --> 27:50.667
of my talents.

27:50.709 --> 27:52.583
Q, get to the controls

27:50.709 --> 27:52.583
or get the hell out of here!

27:56.458 --> 27:58.000
Data, you're my liaison

27:56.458 --> 27:58.000
to the Bridge.

27:58.041 --> 28:00.500
I'll need you with me.

28:00.542 --> 28:03.375
Who does he think he

28:00.542 --> 28:03.375
is, giving me orders?

28:03.417 --> 28:05.625
Geordi thinks

28:03.417 --> 28:05.625
he is in command here

28:05.667 --> 28:08.041
and he is correct.

28:11.125 --> 28:14.834
Engineering, holding at station

28:11.125 --> 28:14.834
keeping, range 640 meters.

28:14.875 --> 28:17.041
DATA:

28:14.875 --> 28:17.041
Containment fields

28:14.875 --> 28:17.041
to flight tolerance.

28:17.083 --> 28:19.709
Warp core to 90%.

28:19.750 --> 28:23.125
Engage field coils,

28:19.750 --> 28:23.125
tractor beam to stand-by.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.709
Field output?

28:25.750 --> 28:27.417
<i>Field output?</i>

28:27.458 --> 28:29.500
(<i> bored</i> ):

28:27.458 --> 28:29.500
Two-seventeen.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.083
Impulse engines to full.

28:33.417 --> 28:35.208
Ready to engage tractor beam.

28:35.250 --> 28:37.166
Lowering shields,

28:35.250 --> 28:37.166
engage tractor beam.

28:41.834 --> 28:44.083
Extending warp field forward.

28:44.125 --> 28:45.917
PICARD:

28:44.125 --> 28:45.917
Engineering, is that

28:44.125 --> 28:45.917
the forward limit?

28:45.959 --> 28:49.417
Yes, Captain, we are unable

28:45.959 --> 28:49.417
to encompass the entire moon.

28:49.458 --> 28:50.834
Do you recommend

28:49.458 --> 28:50.834
that we proceed?

28:50.875 --> 28:52.166
The two parts of the moon

28:52.208 --> 28:54.625
will have different

28:52.208 --> 28:54.625
inertial densities.

28:54.667 --> 28:56.417
Stand by, Captain.

28:56.458 --> 28:58.500
I can adjust the field symmetry

28:56.458 --> 28:58.500
to compensate.

28:58.542 --> 28:59.875
I doubt it.

28:59.917 --> 29:02.208
You don't know

28:59.917 --> 29:02.208
what this ship can do, mister.

29:02.250 --> 29:04.583
Yes, Captain,

29:02.250 --> 29:04.583
I still believe it'll work.

29:04.625 --> 29:07.750
Increasing power to warp field

29:04.625 --> 29:07.750
and tractor beam.

29:07.792 --> 29:09.250
And if you're wrong

29:07.792 --> 29:09.250
the moon will crumble

29:09.291 --> 29:11.166
due to subspace compression.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.291
Don't say

29:11.208 --> 29:12.291
I didn't warn you.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.625
Shut up, Q.

29:13.667 --> 29:15.959
I will not be spoken to

29:13.667 --> 29:15.959
in this manner!

29:16.000 --> 29:17.667
Data.

29:17.709 --> 29:20.917
Q, I strongly suggest

29:17.709 --> 29:20.917
that you cooperate.

29:25.166 --> 29:26.792
Inertial mass of

29:25.166 --> 29:26.792
the moon is decreasing

29:26.834 --> 29:30.458
to approximately

29:26.834 --> 29:30.458
2.5 million metric tons.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.000
It<i> is</i> working.

29:32.041 --> 29:33.542
We<i> can</i> move it.

29:33.583 --> 29:34.917
Firing impulse engines.

29:38.291 --> 29:42.417
DATA:

29:38.291 --> 29:42.417
Captain, the moon's trajectory

29:38.291 --> 29:42.417
has moved .3 percent.

29:42.458 --> 29:44.291
.4 percent.

30:21.542 --> 30:22.834
We need all the power we have

the matter here, Doctor.

your own standards

of self-preoccupation.

You have no concern

for an officer

31:40.458 --> 31:42.500
who may have

31:40.458 --> 31:42.500
saved your life.

31:42.542 --> 31:44.667
He's strong.

Maybe we can bypass

31:46.667 --> 31:49.291
the flow regulator.

31:49.333 --> 31:51.959
It would be helpful if everybody

31:49.333 --> 31:51.959
just got out of here now.

31:56.542 --> 31:58.417
Stay with Q.

Geordi?

Hmm?

32:03.041 --> 32:06.083
The moon's trajectory.

32:06.125 --> 32:09.417
All we did was buy ourselves

another orbit-- at most.

32:09.458 --> 32:10.625
We can try again

when the moon comes

32:10.667 --> 32:11.834
back to its perigee.

And when we drop our shields

the Calamarains

go after Q again.

not worth it.

(<i> door chimes</i> )

32:25.500 --> 32:26.834
Come.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.500
You're right, of course.

32:31.542 --> 32:33.834
I'm extraordinarily

32:31.542 --> 32:33.834
selfish

32:33.875 --> 32:36.750
but it has served me

32:33.875 --> 32:36.750
so well in the past.

32:36.792 --> 32:39.542
It will not

32:36.792 --> 32:39.542
serve you here.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.041
Don't be so hard

32:39.583 --> 32:42.041
on me, Jean-Luc.

32:42.083 --> 32:43.250
You've been a mortal

32:42.083 --> 32:43.250
all your life.

32:43.291 --> 32:45.083
You know all about dying.

32:45.125 --> 32:47.709
I've never given it

32:45.125 --> 32:47.709
a second thought.

32:47.750 --> 32:50.834
Or a first one,

32:47.750 --> 32:50.834
for that matter.

32:50.875 --> 32:53.250
I could have been killed.

32:53.291 --> 32:54.750
If it hadn't been for Data

32:54.792 --> 32:56.542
and that one brief

32:54.792 --> 32:56.542
delay he created

32:56.583 --> 32:58.667
I would have

32:56.583 --> 32:58.667
been gone.

32:58.709 --> 33:01.709
No more me.

33:01.750 --> 33:02.792
And no one would have missed me

33:02.834 --> 33:04.458
would they?

33:08.083 --> 33:10.583
Data may have sacrificed

33:08.083 --> 33:10.583
himself for me.

33:10.625 --> 33:12.333
Why?

33:12.375 --> 33:14.709
That is his special nature.

33:14.750 --> 33:18.125
He learned the lessons

33:14.750 --> 33:18.125
of humanity well.

33:18.166 --> 33:21.458
When I ask myself if I would

33:18.166 --> 33:21.458
have done the same for him

33:21.500 --> 33:25.667
and I am forced to answer no

33:25.709 --> 33:30.000
I feel... I feel ashamed.

33:30.041 --> 33:32.542
Q, I am not

33:30.041 --> 33:32.542
your father confessor.

33:32.583 --> 33:35.583
You will receive

33:32.583 --> 33:35.583
no absolution from me.

33:35.625 --> 33:38.458
You have brought nothing but

33:35.625 --> 33:38.458
pain and suffering to this crew.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.875
And I am still

33:38.500 --> 33:40.875
not entirely convinced

33:40.917 --> 33:45.709
that all this isn't your latest

33:40.917 --> 33:45.709
attempt at a puerile joke.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.542
It is a joke, a joke on me--

33:47.583 --> 33:51.875
joke of the universe,

33:47.583 --> 33:51.875
the king who would be man.

33:51.917 --> 33:53.625
As I learn

33:51.917 --> 33:53.625
more and more

33:53.667 --> 33:55.875
what it is to be human,

33:53.667 --> 33:55.875
I am more and more convinced

33:55.917 --> 33:57.625
that I would never

33:55.917 --> 33:57.625
make a good one.

33:57.667 --> 34:00.250
I don't have what it takes.

34:00.291 --> 34:04.291
Without my powers,

34:00.291 --> 34:04.291
I'm frightened of everything.

34:04.333 --> 34:06.458
I'm a coward.

34:06.500 --> 34:10.083
And I'm miserable.

34:10.125 --> 34:11.750
And I can't go on this way.

his language circuits,

34:28.417 --> 34:31.083
so he can't talk yet.

34:33.834 --> 34:36.208
There are creatures

34:33.834 --> 34:36.208
in the universe

34:36.250 --> 34:40.250
who would consider you the

34:36.250 --> 34:40.250
ultimate achievement, android.

34:40.291 --> 34:45.750
No feelings, no emotions,

34:40.291 --> 34:45.750
no pain--

34:45.792 --> 34:49.542
and yet you covet

34:45.792 --> 34:49.542
those qualities of humanity.

34:49.583 --> 34:51.417
Believe me,

34:49.583 --> 34:51.417
you're missing nothing.

34:54.667 --> 34:58.500
But if it means anything to you,

34:54.667 --> 34:58.500
you're a better human than I.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.208
Where's the main shuttle bay?

35:12.250 --> 35:14.333
Main shuttle bay is located

35:12.250 --> 35:14.333
on deck four.

35:14.375 --> 35:15.625
Take me there.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.250
(<i> console beeping</i> )

Shuttle occupant,

35:32.750 --> 35:35.875
identify yourself.

35:35.917 --> 35:38.000
Don't try and talk me out of it,

35:35.917 --> 35:38.000
Jean-Luc.

35:38.041 --> 35:39.834
Q, return to the ship

35:38.041 --> 35:39.834
immediately.

35:39.875 --> 35:42.792
I just can't get used

35:39.875 --> 35:42.792
to following orders.

35:42.834 --> 35:46.709
Captain, the plasma cloud

35:42.834 --> 35:46.709
is moving toward the shuttle.

35:46.750 --> 35:48.375
It's easier this way.

35:48.417 --> 35:51.333
They won't bother you

35:48.417 --> 35:51.333
after I'm gone.

35:51.375 --> 35:53.500
Engineering, prepare

35:51.375 --> 35:53.500
to extend shields.

35:53.542 --> 35:56.166
Please, don't fall back

35:53.542 --> 35:56.166
on your tired cliché

35:56.208 --> 35:59.792
of charging to the rescue

35:56.208 --> 35:59.792
just in the nick of time.

35:59.834 --> 36:02.083
I don't want to be rescued.

36:02.125 --> 36:05.291
My life as a human being

36:02.125 --> 36:05.291
has been a dismal failure.

36:05.333 --> 36:08.291
Perhaps my death

36:05.333 --> 36:08.291
will have a little dignity.

36:08.333 --> 36:11.083
Q, there is no dignity

36:08.333 --> 36:11.083
in this suicide.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.375
Yes, I suppose you're right.

36:12.417 --> 36:15.208
Death of a coward, then,

36:12.417 --> 36:15.208
so be it.

36:15.250 --> 36:18.250
But as a human,

36:15.250 --> 36:18.250
I would have died of boredom.

36:34.875 --> 36:38.458
This goes against

36:34.875 --> 36:38.458
my better judgment.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.625
Transporter Room Three,

36:38.500 --> 36:40.625
lock on to Shuttle One.

36:40.667 --> 36:42.000
Beam it back into its bay.

36:42.041 --> 36:43.250
Aye, Captain.

36:45.917 --> 36:48.166
It's a perfectly

36:45.917 --> 36:48.166
good shuttlecraft.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.125
Captain, unable to transport.

36:50.166 --> 36:53.291
For some reason, I can't lock on

36:50.166 --> 36:53.291
to the shuttlecraft.

36:53.333 --> 36:54.417
Worf, are you sensing

36:54.458 --> 36:56.041
any interference

36:54.458 --> 36:56.041
from the Calamarain?

36:56.083 --> 36:58.458
No, sir, but they are still

36:56.083 --> 36:58.458
moving toward the shuttle.

36:58.500 --> 37:01.125
Geordi, extend shields

36:58.500 --> 37:01.125
around Shuttle One.

37:01.166 --> 37:03.667
Extending shields.

37:03.709 --> 37:05.542
Commander,

37:03.709 --> 37:05.542
the shields are frozen.

Ah!

37:35.083 --> 37:37.500
Sacrificing yourself

37:35.083 --> 37:37.500
for these humans?

37:37.542 --> 37:41.083
Do I detect

37:37.542 --> 37:41.083
a<i> little</i> selfless act?

37:41.125 --> 37:42.417
You flatter me.

37:42.458 --> 37:43.917
I was only trying to put

37:42.458 --> 37:43.917
a quick end

37:43.959 --> 37:46.125
to a miserable existence.

37:46.166 --> 37:48.166
(<i> groans</i> )

37:48.208 --> 37:49.417
What a dreadful color.

37:49.458 --> 37:50.875
Yeah.

37:50.917 --> 37:52.542
What are you doing here?

37:52.583 --> 37:55.583
Oh, I've been

37:52.583 --> 37:55.583
keeping track of you.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.333
I always thought

37:55.625 --> 37:57.333
you were in my corner.

37:57.375 --> 37:58.875
Ah, no, no.

37:58.917 --> 38:01.709
See, actually, I was the one

37:58.917 --> 38:01.709
who got you kicked out.

38:01.750 --> 38:03.000
You know, you're

38:01.750 --> 38:03.000
incorrigible, Q.

38:03.041 --> 38:04.166
You're a lost cause.

38:04.208 --> 38:06.208
I can't go

38:04.208 --> 38:06.208
to a single solar system

38:06.250 --> 38:09.208
without having

38:06.250 --> 38:09.208
to... apologize for you

38:09.250 --> 38:10.500
and I'm tired of it.

38:10.542 --> 38:11.875
I wasn't the one who misplaced

38:11.917 --> 38:14.166
the entire

38:11.917 --> 38:14.166
Deltived asteroid belt.

38:14.208 --> 38:16.417
Hey, this isn't about me.

38:16.458 --> 38:18.500
I got better places to be.

38:18.542 --> 38:20.000
But somebody had to keep

38:18.542 --> 38:20.000
an eye on you to make sure

38:20.041 --> 38:23.333
you still didn't find a way

38:20.041 --> 38:23.333
to cause trouble.

38:23.375 --> 38:24.792
Even as a member

38:23.375 --> 38:24.792
of this...

38:24.834 --> 38:28.750
hmm... limited species.

38:28.792 --> 38:31.208
Well, I... I hope

38:28.792 --> 38:31.208
I've been entertaining you.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.083
Barely.

38:35.125 --> 38:38.500
But... I find these humans

38:35.125 --> 38:38.500
rather interesting.

38:38.542 --> 38:40.709
I'm beginning to understand

38:38.542 --> 38:40.709
what you see in them.

38:40.750 --> 38:42.083
After all the things

38:40.750 --> 38:42.083
that you've done

38:42.125 --> 38:44.750
they're still intent

38:42.125 --> 38:44.750
on keeping you safe.

38:44.792 --> 38:46.917
A genetic weakness

38:44.792 --> 38:46.917
of the race.

38:46.959 --> 38:48.583
And they're still at it.

38:48.625 --> 38:50.750
They just tried to... mmm...

38:50.792 --> 38:54.000
beam you up, back

38:50.792 --> 38:54.000
whatever it is they call it.

38:54.041 --> 38:55.208
Really.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.166
I stopped them.

38:57.208 --> 38:59.291
Well, if the Calamarains

38:57.208 --> 38:59.291
hurry up and finish me off

38:59.333 --> 39:00.959
we can get you back

38:59.333 --> 39:00.959
on your way.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.709
Afraid I had to put

39:01.000 --> 39:02.709
them on hold, too.

39:02.750 --> 39:08.792
You see, there's still this

39:02.750 --> 39:08.792
matter of the selfless act.

39:08.834 --> 39:10.458
Now, you and I both know

39:08.834 --> 39:10.458
that the Calamarain

39:10.500 --> 39:11.625
would have

39:10.500 --> 39:11.625
eventually destroyed

39:11.667 --> 39:14.166
the<i> Enterprise</i>

39:11.667 --> 39:14.166
to get to you

39:14.208 --> 39:17.083
and that's really

39:14.208 --> 39:17.083
why you left, right?

39:17.125 --> 39:19.333
It was a teeny bit selfless,

39:17.125 --> 39:19.333
wasn't it?

39:19.375 --> 39:21.166
Oh! Yeah, and

39:19.375 --> 39:21.166
there's my problem.

39:21.208 --> 39:22.500
See, I can't go back

39:21.208 --> 39:22.500
to the Continuum

39:22.542 --> 39:23.709
and tell them

39:22.542 --> 39:23.709
that you committed

39:23.750 --> 39:25.000
a selfless act

39:23.750 --> 39:25.000
just before the end.

39:25.041 --> 39:26.834
If I do, there's going

39:25.041 --> 39:26.834
to be questions

39:26.875 --> 39:29.625
there's going to be explanations

39:26.875 --> 39:29.625
<i>for centuries.</i>

39:29.667 --> 39:31.959
I've learned my lesson, Q.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.709
Remember who

39:32.000 --> 39:34.709
you're talking to--

39:34.750 --> 39:39.709
all knowing, all seeing.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.417
(<i> sighs</i> )

39:41.458 --> 39:43.667
Hmm, fine.

39:43.709 --> 39:45.417
Oh... you got your powers back.

39:47.375 --> 39:48.917
Try and stay out of trouble.

39:56.083 --> 39:58.417
So they wanted to destroy me,

39:56.083 --> 39:58.417
did they?

40:02.875 --> 40:06.041
If you think I tormented you

40:02.875 --> 40:06.041
in the past, my little friends

40:06.083 --> 40:08.750
wait until you see

40:06.083 --> 40:08.750
what I do with you now.

40:08.792 --> 40:10.458
Q...?

40:11.875 --> 40:14.417
I was just seeing

40:11.875 --> 40:14.417
if you were still watching.

40:18.542 --> 40:21.750
Captain,

40:18.542 --> 40:21.750
the aliens have disappeared

40:21.792 --> 40:23.208
and so has the shuttle.

40:23.250 --> 40:24.417
Scan the sector.

40:24.458 --> 40:26.542
I have, sir.

40:26.583 --> 40:30.917
Well... I suppose

40:26.583 --> 40:30.917
that is the end of Q.

40:36.041 --> 40:38.542
<i>Au contraire,</i>

40:36.041 --> 40:38.542
<i>mon capitaine!</i>

40:38.583 --> 40:41.000
He's back!

40:41.041 --> 40:43.291
(<i> playing mariachi music</i> )

40:57.083 --> 40:58.917
I'm forgiven.

40:58.959 --> 41:00.625
My brothers and sisters

40:58.959 --> 41:00.625
of the Continuum

41:00.667 --> 41:01.959
have taken me back.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.875
I'm immortal again,

41:02.000 --> 41:05.875
omnipotent again.

41:05.917 --> 41:07.208
Swell.

41:07.250 --> 41:08.792
Don't fret, Riker.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.125
My good fortune

41:08.834 --> 41:11.125
is your good fortune.

41:15.792 --> 41:17.750
I don't need your fantasy women.

41:17.792 --> 41:19.291
Oh, you're so stolid.

41:19.333 --> 41:20.917
You weren't like that

41:19.333 --> 41:20.917
before the beard.

41:23.250 --> 41:24.291
(<i> sighs</i> )

41:24.333 --> 41:25.500
Very well.

41:30.417 --> 41:31.625
Q!

41:31.667 --> 41:33.417
But I feel like celebrating.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.709
I don't!

41:35.750 --> 41:37.041
All right.

41:41.959 --> 41:43.208
All of it.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.709
Oh...

41:49.166 --> 41:51.417
Now, at the risk

41:49.166 --> 41:51.417
of being rude...

41:51.458 --> 41:53.709
Yes, once again,

41:51.458 --> 41:53.709
I've overstayed

41:51.458 --> 41:53.709
my welcome.

41:53.750 --> 41:55.834
As a human,

41:53.750 --> 41:55.834
I was ill-equipped to thank you

41:55.875 --> 41:59.875
but, as myself, you have

41:55.875 --> 41:59.875
my everlasting gratitude.

41:59.917 --> 42:02.041
Until next time.

42:02.083 --> 42:07.709
Ah, but, before I go,

42:02.083 --> 42:07.709
there's a debt I wish to repay

42:07.750 --> 42:09.959
to my professor

42:07.750 --> 42:09.959
of the humanities.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.250
Data, I've decided

42:11.291 --> 42:14.500
to give you something

42:11.291 --> 42:14.500
very, very special.

42:14.542 --> 42:16.500
If your intention is

42:14.542 --> 42:16.500
to make me human, Q...

42:16.542 --> 42:17.959
No, no, no, no, no.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.709
I would never curse you

42:18.000 --> 42:20.709
by making you human.

42:20.750 --> 42:24.917
Think of it...

42:20.750 --> 42:24.917
as a going-away present.

42:33.375 --> 42:38.375
(<i> laughing uproariously</i> )

42:43.625 --> 42:45.375
LA FORGE:

42:43.625 --> 42:45.375
Data...?

42:54.917 --> 42:57.542
Data, why are

42:54.917 --> 42:57.542
you laughing?

42:57.583 --> 42:59.291
It...

43:07.083 --> 43:11.792
I do not know.

43:11.834 --> 43:15.250
But it was a wonderful...

43:11.834 --> 43:15.250
feeling.

43:15.291 --> 43:16.500
(<i> console beeping</i> )

43:16.542 --> 43:20.333
Captain, Bre'el IV

43:16.542 --> 43:20.333
is hailing us.

43:20.375 --> 43:21.792
On screen,

43:20.375 --> 43:21.792
Lieutenant.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.625
Captain Picard,

43:23.000 --> 43:26.625
you've done it.

43:26.667 --> 43:28.125
I'm sorry?

43:28.166 --> 43:31.333
The moon-- it's back

43:28.166 --> 43:31.333
to its normal orbit.

43:31.375 --> 43:33.959
However you did

43:31.375 --> 43:33.959
it, thank you.

43:38.166 --> 43:39.750
Let's see it, Worf.

43:46.250 --> 43:48.041
Mr. Data, your analysis?

43:48.083 --> 43:50.792
The moon's altitude

43:48.083 --> 43:50.792
is 55,000 kilometers.

43:50.834 --> 43:52.834
Projected orbit is circular.

43:52.875 --> 43:54.709
There is no further danger

43:52.875 --> 43:54.709
to the planet.

44:01.875 --> 44:06.291
Ensign, set course

44:01.875 --> 44:06.291
for Station Nigala IV.

44:06.333 --> 44:07.709
Aye, sir.

44:13.834 --> 44:19.625
Perhaps there's a... residue

44:13.834 --> 44:19.625
of humanity in Q after all.

44:23.083 --> 44:25.667
Ensign, en...

44:25.709 --> 44:28.917
Don't bet

44:25.709 --> 44:28.917
on it, Picard.
