WEBVTT

00:09.480 --> 00:11.080
<i>Why would he do that?</i>

00:11.120 --> 00:14.000
- Every Lupar has
a designated human.
- I'm not your human!

00:14.040 --> 00:16.040
We have to save
them before it's too late.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.840
What is it
you're saving them from?

00:17.880 --> 00:19.800
- The Flux.
- What's the Flux?

00:19.840 --> 00:23.400
This is Serving Commander
Inston-Vee Vinder,
leaving his post.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.160
- They are without purpose.
- Your mind will boggle.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.320
- Hello again, Doctor.
- Who are you?

00:28.360 --> 00:30.160
Our final fight has begun.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.720
The end of the universe.

00:32.760 --> 00:35.080
I always wondered
what it would feel like!

01:04.760 --> 01:06.360
End of the universe.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.080
But we're still here.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.080
- Wherever here is.
- Doctor!

01:19.120 --> 01:20.800
Yaz! Is Dan with you?

01:20.840 --> 01:23.600
I'm here. I just blacked out.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.880
Last thing I remember,
we were on your TARDIS,

01:25.920 --> 01:29.000
that Flux thing was coming
at us and then, nothing.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.520
Me too. I think.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.320
I was on the ground
over there. We must have
been thrown out.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.640
Must have been.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.240
Where are we?

01:39.880 --> 01:42.640
- Is she always like this?
- Pretty much.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.160
If I had to call it,
we're back on Earth.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.400
Which meant,
the Lupari Shield worked,
but the TARDIS took a hit.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.200
Looks like we're in
the middle of a battle field,
which could mean--

01:56.240 --> 01:58.440
Hey! Get away from him.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.480
Show me your hands.
What did you take? Show me!

02:03.520 --> 02:05.160
We didn't take anything.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.200
I know what goes on out here.

02:07.240 --> 02:10.240
Vultures! Emptying the
pockets of the dead.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.440
But who are you?
Where are you from?

02:15.480 --> 02:17.520
I'm the Doctor.
This is Yaz, this is Dan.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.040
Nice to meet you. We were
checking for signs of life.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.800
Sure, Doctor is a man's term.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.440
It's fluid.

02:25.400 --> 02:30.520
Sentry Patrol, all of them
dead. It's too late
for medical aid.

02:32.760 --> 02:36.640
But you are too close
to the front to be
with Mrs Nightingale.

02:36.680 --> 02:40.040
She won't come this close
to Sebastopol. How long
have you been here?

02:40.080 --> 02:43.560
Sebastopol, 1850s. Oriented!

02:43.600 --> 02:44.800
I know where we are.

02:44.840 --> 02:48.800
Crimean War, 1855,
Ottoman Empire weakening,

02:48.840 --> 02:50.560
British soldiers
fighting Russians.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.880
- What?
- We're in the middle
of the Crimean War.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.760
That would make you
Mary Seacole. Are you?
You are, aren't you?

02:57.800 --> 03:01.840
Mrs Seacole to you.
Doctress to the fallen.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.160
Everybody, shush.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.600
- Listen.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.760
- It's enemy soldiers.
Back up, back up.
- Oh!

03:12.040 --> 03:13.280
Where in the battle are we?

03:13.320 --> 03:16.240
How many Russian troops
are the British fighting?

03:16.280 --> 03:18.080
What's happening
in Sebastopol?

03:18.120 --> 03:21.320
What's this word you keep
using, "Russians"?

03:22.120 --> 03:23.600
They're not fighting Russians.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.520
They're fighting Sontarans.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.880
Taste the victory,
my soldiers.

03:38.920 --> 03:44.560
Breathe in the rotting stench
of our vanquished foes.

03:44.600 --> 03:49.040
Onwards, to domination.
Sontar-Ha!

03:49.080 --> 03:53.640
Sontar-Ha!
Sontar-Ha! Sontar-Ha!

04:34.040 --> 04:35.040
Oh!

04:39.480 --> 04:40.480
Ah!

04:50.280 --> 04:52.800
Are you response?
Can you repair?

04:55.360 --> 04:57.400
- Can I what?
- Can you repair!?

04:57.440 --> 05:00.520
- Wait, where am I?
- Can you repair? Respond!

05:00.560 --> 05:03.800
I... I need to make contact
with my home planet.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.760
There's been a mass extinction
event near where
I was stationed.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.800
We are aware. The Flux
impacted the inner temple.
Can you repair?

05:12.560 --> 05:13.640
Repair what?

05:14.240 --> 05:16.040
Follow. Follow.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.400
PRIEST
This was not foreseen.

05:21.440 --> 05:25.600
Priest Triangles
are only guardians.
We maintain and serve.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.360
The impact of the Flux event
was too great.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.440
The temple is compromised.
The Mouri must never
be compromised.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.960
Do you see, do you see
the Mouri?

05:43.800 --> 05:45.840
Whoa!

05:45.880 --> 05:49.280
Thank you for
getting us out of there
safely, Mrs Seacole.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.480
I know every safe avenue on
and off of this battlefield.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.400
I have to stay alive if
I'm going to nurse
these men back to health.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.160
- You're an army nurse?
- Oh, no.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.360
I work for myself. I am the
closest nurse to the front.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.480
- And this is your hospital?

06:03.520 --> 06:06.480
This is much more
than a hospital, child.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.840
This is my British hotel.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.520
So, let me just
get this straight.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.280
She's, like, a real person
from history.

06:19.320 --> 06:20.600
You just talked to her,
didn't ya?

06:20.640 --> 06:25.080
And those Sontaran things,
they're not part of history?

06:25.120 --> 06:28.160
- Really?
- No. She should be here,
they shouldn't.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.080
Could this be connected
to the Flux?

06:31.280 --> 06:32.400
Is history being rewritten?

06:34.160 --> 06:36.120
Dan, are you okay?

06:37.360 --> 06:38.960
Are you seeing that?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.040
Stay still, Dan.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.520
What's happening to me?

06:45.280 --> 06:46.720
Huh! Dan!

06:48.080 --> 06:50.960
Doctor! You're fading.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.760
A collision between
Flux and vortex energy.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.680
You're falling through
space and time.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.080
Yaz, stay calm.
I will find you.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.080
- Promise?
- I promise!

07:20.480 --> 07:22.080
Where's the door?
I need the door.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.040
Over there, Commander!
A voice.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.440
Another soldier
waiting to be obliterated.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.720
Let me in!
I have to find them.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.960
Spread out
and locate the human scum!

07:46.560 --> 07:47.560
I'm home?

07:58.880 --> 08:02.520
Jim! Jim, it's me, Dan!

08:04.400 --> 08:06.360
Sorry about the house,
I can explain.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.120
Jim!

08:18.600 --> 08:20.240
Come on, Dad.
Pick up, will ya?

08:24.280 --> 08:25.280
What?

08:30.320 --> 08:31.320
No way.

08:43.920 --> 08:46.560
- What the hell is that?
- SONTARAN
Curfew defier,

08:46.600 --> 08:49.200
breach of curfew will result
in instant execution.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.800
Soldiers, apprehend! Divide
and cover all escape routes.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.960
Mam? Dad?

09:07.960 --> 09:09.960
Where the hell have you been?

09:17.720 --> 09:18.840
Doctor?

09:20.960 --> 09:21.960
Dan?

09:24.040 --> 09:28.640
I need a universal GPS,
then I'd know where I was,
whenever this happens.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.000
'Cause it just
keeps happening.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.120
JOSEPH
This is intolerable!

09:39.800 --> 09:42.480
Hi, I'm Yaz.

09:42.520 --> 09:43.880
How am I to cope?

09:43.920 --> 09:46.640
- Cope with what, sir?
- Well, any of it.

09:46.680 --> 09:51.240
All of it, just--
It insists on shifting.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.560
Why don't you take me
through it from the start?

09:53.600 --> 09:57.080
From the start.
You mock me, madam. The start.

09:57.720 --> 09:58.720
All right.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.280
Can you tell me
what's the year?

10:06.680 --> 10:10.600
Why? Do you believe it to be
a matter of import?

10:10.640 --> 10:14.280
- It might be.
- It is the year
of our Lord 1820.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.440
Do you reckon it differently?

10:19.320 --> 10:20.440
Very differently.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.160
Oh!

10:27.200 --> 10:28.640
All our fears made true.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.440
All is porous, all is broken.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.640
I must retrace.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.800
There's so much work
to be done.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.560
- I'll come with you.
- No. No, it's to no avail,

10:44.400 --> 10:45.880
if my experience holds true.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.760
Ah, this confounded situation.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.000
- Can you repair?
- Can I what?

10:59.040 --> 11:01.920
All assistance is required.
Can you repair?

11:08.760 --> 11:10.880
Yeah. I can.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.080
That's exactly why I'm here.

11:23.520 --> 11:28.360
Oh, Mrs Seacole,
I helped myself to the rum,
er, to aid planning.

11:28.400 --> 11:33.200
It can go on your slate,
General. Your rapidly
rising slate.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.480
Good evening.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.160
- Where are your friends?
- They were called away,

11:40.360 --> 11:43.280
while I'm remaining here
for now,

11:43.800 --> 11:45.080
apparently.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.760
Well, then, you are most
welcome to the British Hotel.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.000
New arrival, Mrs Seacole.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.920
Oh, yes.
We met on the battlefield.

11:51.960 --> 11:55.760
This is Lieutenant-General
Logan of the Light Division.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.160
I'm the Doctor.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.320
Oh, Mrs Seacole
could certainly do
with your assistance.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.360
Our advance tomorrow
is not without risk.

12:05.160 --> 12:08.160
Please tell me you're not
about to engage Sontarans
in battle.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.960
That is why we're here.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.360
You don't understand.
I've fought Sontarans before.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.640
Ha! Somehow I doubt that.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.640
Sontarans live for war.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.560
They're a clone race.
It's what they're bred for.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.640
It's their entire history. And
they're very, very good at it.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.480
They also have weapons
beyond your imagination.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.200
So even if you do have
numerical advantage,

12:29.240 --> 12:32.360
I advise, at all costs,
do not engage.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.880
Then it's fortunate that
I command these divisions
of Her Majesty's Army

12:35.920 --> 12:37.560
and you do not.

12:39.320 --> 12:43.280
- Madam, I'm at work.
- I know. I can smell the rum.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.440
How long have they been here,
the Sontarans?

12:45.480 --> 12:49.120
What, outside Sebastopol?

12:49.160 --> 12:51.560
- No, on Earth.
- They've always been here.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.920
Trust me, I know your history,
and that's not true.

12:59.400 --> 13:04.720
Where are we? Britain there,
Jamaica here, still intact.

13:04.760 --> 13:08.360
Er, Columbia there
and Russia is--

13:11.000 --> 13:15.200
Not there. No Russia,
no China, only Sontar.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.920
And you both think
that's normal.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.920
War is the opposite of normal.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.120
Er, that word you used,
er, "Russia".

13:23.160 --> 13:25.400
Where have I
heard that before?

13:25.440 --> 13:30.520
She said it earlier.
I thought the same.
I heard it before in the past.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.280
Like a memory.
An echo of another time.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.640
Yes.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.680
Time has been disrupted.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.480
But if you're still retaining
those memories of the truth,

13:39.520 --> 13:41.760
then the disruption
must be recent.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.640
But how? Fall-out from
the Flux? Yeah, but that
wouldn't be enough.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.920
Oh, I mean, Sontarans are
embedded in maps,
all of a sudden.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.600
Are you expecting a response
to your musings?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.160
How far away
is their encampment?

13:58.200 --> 13:59.760
You've gone very quiet,
General.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.480
The soldiers appear
from directions unknown.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.080
See?

14:06.120 --> 14:08.880
They're doing the basics
and you're already
on the back foot.

14:08.920 --> 14:12.240
You will lose every man
if you face them
in the battlefield tomorrow.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.800
You need my help.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.040
I have Queen and country
on my side, that is all
the help I need.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.840
She here with you now then,
the Queen?

14:18.480 --> 14:19.800
Obviously not!

14:19.840 --> 14:21.520
Then her influence
may be limited.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.040
Mrs Seacole,
your new assistant
is putting me off my task.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.760
You want to be helpful,
Doctor?

14:28.680 --> 14:29.920
Nursing rounds.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.760
You have to get the General
to listen to me.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.600
You think the Army take advice
from a Doctress?

14:38.600 --> 14:41.680
I am here
to nurse the wounded.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.200
Sifting the battlefields
for injured soldiers,

14:46.240 --> 14:47.920
setting up a sanctuary?

14:47.960 --> 14:50.120
You just decided to come
out here, on your own?

14:50.160 --> 14:51.800
If we all of us waited
to be sent for,

14:51.840 --> 14:54.480
we'd none of us find
our purpose, would we?

14:54.520 --> 14:59.200
I paid for my own passage
and I had this place
built from what I could find.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.040
A proper pioneer.

15:02.080 --> 15:05.440
Rice pudding
and hard liquor build morale.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.080
They also pay for medicine.

15:08.120 --> 15:12.280
But my time and my skills,
those I give for free
to all comers.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.800
Speaking of which,
come over here.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.520
The General does not approve.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.520
More of you!

15:29.560 --> 15:32.920
More to destroy when I free
myself! Which will be soon.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.200
This is a surprise.

15:35.240 --> 15:36.960
No wonder the General
doesn't approve.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.480
All life is sacred to me.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.000
I use my remedies
to help whoever is in need.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.840
Just as you did
the Russian soldiers.

15:42.880 --> 15:48.600
Although this one has
refused all treatment
and healed himself.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.200
He takes his rest in
a regular rhythm.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.160
Seven and a half minutes
every 27 hours. I recorded it.

15:55.200 --> 15:59.040
I shall massacre you
for revealing privileged
military information.

15:59.080 --> 16:02.920
- The rest of the time,
he yells.
- No wonder you're angry.

16:02.960 --> 16:07.040
Capture, the ultimate shame
for any Sontaran.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.680
How did he come to this?

16:08.720 --> 16:11.160
I was dispatched
by my commanding officer

16:11.200 --> 16:12.840
to assess
the laughable strength

16:12.880 --> 16:15.640
of the weak and pathetic
human resistance,

16:15.680 --> 16:19.200
and was ambushed
by a circular propellant.

16:19.240 --> 16:23.160
- Cannon ball in the back.
- Oh, I bet that hurt.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.200
There is no such thing
as pain.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.200
- A little.
- You're lucky
you survived at all.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.440
You call this luck!

16:32.480 --> 16:35.320
The gloried embrace of death
would have been luck.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.240
I have questions for you,
soldier.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.400
I will answer nothing.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.280
I am trained to resist
all interrogations.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.760
Where's your encampment?

16:43.800 --> 16:46.080
- I assert my rights
to silence...
- Mmm.

16:46.120 --> 16:51.520
...under section
Cyan K-Z Nine Slothback
of the Shadow Proclamation.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.120
Oh, you do, do ya?

16:53.160 --> 16:56.160
But what if I have
valuable battle information
for your commander?

16:56.200 --> 16:58.480
What sort of information?

16:59.680 --> 17:01.880
- The Doctor.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.320
Vanquisher and sworn enemy
of the Sontarans,

17:05.360 --> 17:09.200
former President of Gallifrey,
is in the Crimea.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.480
Where? Show me.

17:12.520 --> 17:17.560
I will vanquish our despised
nemesis with my bare hands.
Where is the Doctor?

17:17.600 --> 17:20.160
Closer than you could
possibly imagine.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.040
- Hhow can it have heard of--

17:24.200 --> 17:27.600
I'd be prepared to give
your commander information
on the Doctor's whereabouts

17:27.640 --> 17:30.200
should he agree
to parlay on my signal.

17:30.240 --> 17:35.440
Now, if we release you, will
you relay this information?

17:37.440 --> 17:39.200
I accept your offer

17:39.240 --> 17:44.520
and pledge to end your life
with maximum suffering
at our next encounter.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.840
I'd expect no less.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.680
May death rain down
on you both.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.120
Well, it's nice to meet you,
too. Hurry along.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.680
Human scum! You will be
stamped beneath
the boot of Sontar!

18:03.720 --> 18:05.600
At a future point,
to be determined.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.320
Do not shoot!

18:13.600 --> 18:16.600
You allowed an enemy combatant
to escape!

18:16.640 --> 18:20.400
I discharged my patient.

18:20.440 --> 18:23.120
The British Hotel
is my establishment, General.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.520
And you are my guest.

18:27.760 --> 18:31.480
Mrs Seacole, may I suggest
an evening constitutional?
Come along.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.760
MRS
<i>What are we doing?</i>

18:37.800 --> 18:41.240
The thing about
Sontaran soldiers
is they're not very bright,

18:41.280 --> 18:43.600
but that means
you can take advantage.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.240
Miladdo's got a message
for his General.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.400
With any luck,
he's gonna lead us

18:48.440 --> 18:52.160
right to the location
of the Sontaran base camp.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.160
- Pretty simple, right?
- Wait.

18:55.560 --> 19:00.120
- Who are you?
- Me? I'm Mary Seacole's
assistant.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.120
MRS Where did he go?

19:08.160 --> 19:09.840
See, Mary?

19:11.080 --> 19:12.760
- No.
- Exactly.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.720
A conjuring trick?

19:16.760 --> 19:20.560
In a manner of speaking,
basic camouflage shield.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.360
But if you don't know
it's there, it's impossible
to spot.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.680
Want to give it a go with me?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.600
Where are we now?

19:38.720 --> 19:42.440
Soldiers!
Marching duty until sunrise!

19:42.480 --> 19:47.240
Strategic base
construction troops report
to Commander Strevs.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.200
Security patrols
must execute--

19:49.240 --> 19:54.200
- There's so many of them.
- Yes. There are.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.760
Mary, you're good at keeping
observation records, right?

19:57.280 --> 19:58.520
Of course.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.440
And you can survive on
very little sleep, I imagine.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.240
- What are you asking of me?
- Monitor this encampment.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.800
Keep a note of everything
that happens.
But stay out of sight.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.840
I can do that.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.520
I think. Can't I?

20:19.480 --> 20:25.360
You return to us wounded,
humiliated and no deaths
to your credit.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.520
I bring information,
Commander Skaak.

20:28.560 --> 20:33.080
The sworn enemy of Sontar,
the Doctor, is here on Earth.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.400
The Doctor is here?

20:35.440 --> 20:39.560
My source will request parlay
to discuss bringing
the Doctor to you.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.160
This is useful.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.480
You have done adequately.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.200
I am shamed, Commander.

20:50.240 --> 20:54.440
Yes. The stench of your
humiliation infects us all.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.760
I request mercy.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.200
Request granted.

21:02.240 --> 21:06.560
The mercy of immediate
execution be upon you.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.000
For unanswerable shame
upon Sontar.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.960
Sontar-Ho.

21:13.280 --> 21:16.000
Sontar-Ho.

21:32.880 --> 21:36.000
So when did they turn up here,
these Sontarans?

21:36.040 --> 21:37.800
Same day you vanished.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.280
What's that, two days ago now?

21:40.320 --> 21:41.920
Already feels like a month.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.400
We had the Three-Minute
Eclipse and then, bang,
they were here.

21:45.440 --> 21:46.840
Three-Minute Eclipse?

21:46.880 --> 21:50.040
Whole world went to blackout,
all at the same time.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.960
Lasted three minutes.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.640
Must have been
the Karvanista's ships.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.280
So, come on,
where have you been?

21:58.400 --> 22:00.200
It's a bit hard to explain.

22:00.240 --> 22:03.720
Hey, lad, did someone
nick your house?

22:03.760 --> 22:06.160
Sort of. Listen, how
many of these are there?

22:06.200 --> 22:10.080
Oh, millions. All over
the world in their ships,

22:10.120 --> 22:13.240
soldiers pouring out
and taking over.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.160
But you can knock 'em out
with a frying pan?

22:15.200 --> 22:18.000
They've got this thing
on the back of their neck,
like a hole.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.280
Probic something.

22:19.320 --> 22:22.160
Yeah, all right, Eileen,
no need to get all medical.

22:22.200 --> 22:26.760
But if you smack bang on it,
then they go down
like ninepins.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.080
Who found that out?

22:28.120 --> 22:30.680
- Feller in Birkenhead.
- He was drunk with a mallet.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.600
Birkenhead.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.640
We've got to get rid of 'em.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.160
That's what I said.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.520
That's what I said.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.160
You said they'd be off
after the weekend.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.320
- I never did.
- He does this to annoy me.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.120
They were in Liverpool first.

22:47.160 --> 22:51.280
Six hours before anywhere
else. Nobody believed us.

22:51.320 --> 22:55.400
They went all round the world,
but they started here.

22:55.440 --> 22:58.800
When you say here,
where exactly do you mean?

23:05.040 --> 23:06.640
This is where
they first appeared.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.280
Took over
the whole waterfront.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.520
Let's go have a look.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.760
Hey, where you going?

23:16.800 --> 23:20.080
There's thousands of them.
They've got lasers.

23:20.120 --> 23:23.640
Dad, this is our planet.
These are our docks.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.840
What else are you gonna do?
Sit at home and complain?

23:25.880 --> 23:27.240
It's what he normally does.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.800
Oi, you! I'm not afraid
of a scrap.

23:30.560 --> 23:31.680
I was Wallasey's--

23:31.720 --> 23:33.840
Junior Boxing Champion, 1996.

23:36.560 --> 23:40.600
We've already heard
of people trying and then
just disappearing.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.200
Yeah, well,
I've had some experience

23:43.240 --> 23:45.200
of dealing with aliens
these last few days.

23:49.560 --> 23:53.800
You two, get back to
the house. I'm going in.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.640
What, by yourself?

23:56.280 --> 23:57.400
It's better that way.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.040
Take this, son.

24:03.440 --> 24:04.440
In case you need it.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.920
What happened
to these two? They're all
burned out.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.880
PRIEST
Can you repair?

24:22.920 --> 24:24.640
I don't know what you mean.

24:27.080 --> 24:30.360
PRIEST
Transmission received from
outer corridor priest triangle.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.920
There is another.
You will step aside.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.120
Repair is here.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.720
Hi, I'm Yaz.

24:42.760 --> 24:47.960
Serving Commander Inston-Vee
Vinder of Kasto-Winfer-Foxfell
at your service.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.720
Oh, well,
if we're going formal,

24:49.760 --> 24:52.320
Serving Officer Khan,
Hallamshire Police.
Earth Division.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.040
- At yours.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.600
PRIEST
Repair! Repair!

24:57.640 --> 24:58.840
You know how to fix this?

25:01.840 --> 25:05.200
- Full disclosure,
Inston-Vee Vinder.
- Just Vinder's fine.

25:05.240 --> 25:08.520
I don't know how I got here,
or why, or where here is
or how I get back home.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.960
Same.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.560
I don't wanna freak you out, but
there's something very wrong

25:11.600 --> 25:13.680
with the universe right now.
I saw it for myself.

25:13.720 --> 25:18.280
Me too. From my outpost.
Those objects, they called it
The Flux.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.760
What do they want repairing?

25:25.400 --> 25:26.400
This.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.640
Oh.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.040
Well,

25:33.400 --> 25:36.440
I was hoping
it was gonna be a bit smaller.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.600
Less abstract.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.120
More like a washing machine.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.800
So, these are what are broken?
Like a before and after.

25:50.680 --> 25:51.720
That's not all.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.600
Step back.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.520
Proximity activation,
on all of them.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.560
Not sure why.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.160
Do you even know
what this place is?

26:07.200 --> 26:10.240
The triangle said
it's the Temple of Atropos.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.200
- But it can't be.
- Why not?

26:12.240 --> 26:14.520
PRIEST
Repair! You must repair!

26:14.560 --> 26:15.960
I'm gonna need
more information.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.480
Take us through the basics.
Idiot's guide.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.080
PRIEST
Repair must not be
undertaken by idiots.

26:21.120 --> 26:27.520
Explain Mouri,
explain Atropos,

26:27.560 --> 26:30.920
and set context for repair.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.760
PRIEST
We are the Guardian Priests.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.960
We maintain the Temple of
Atropos on the planet of Time.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.360
All time passes through
the Mouri. Must pass
through the Mouri.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.640
Before Atropos, Time ran wild.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.000
To harness,
the Mouri were assigned.

26:45.840 --> 26:46.880
Assigned by who?

26:46.920 --> 26:49.800
PRIEST
Information unavailable.

26:49.840 --> 26:53.080
If the Mouri are broken,
Time shall run unstoppable.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.600
Which is a problem, right?

26:55.640 --> 26:57.400
PRIEST
Time is destruction.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.200
The Mouri are controlled.
They must not break.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.680
Time must not be unleashed.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.320
You talk about Time
as if it was a force.

27:05.360 --> 27:09.160
PRIEST Time's evil.
And it will seek its own.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.920
Human filth
has been discovered
within the compound.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.560
Commander Riskaw
requires an execution troop.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.120
Immediate deployment.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.320
Bring them here!

27:32.360 --> 27:33.520
Place them in line.

27:35.920 --> 27:39.680
I am Commander Riskaw
of Sontaran Temporal Command.

27:40.680 --> 27:44.040
Spying is treason
against Sontar.

27:45.240 --> 27:49.520
If you have any words,
now is the moment

27:49.560 --> 27:52.440
to keep them to yourselves.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.760
Soldiers! Raise arms!

27:57.800 --> 27:59.240
Execute!

28:02.640 --> 28:05.720
Execution complete.

28:05.760 --> 28:10.440
Our Temporal Offensive
is near, soldiers.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.560
- Sontar-Ha!
- Sontar-Ha!

28:13.600 --> 28:15.960
Sontar-Ha!
Sontar-Ha! Sontar-Ha!

28:20.880 --> 28:24.160
Enough!
Stay alert for intruders.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.520
We will execute
all who defy us!

28:51.560 --> 28:53.600
Parlay.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.800
- Over here!

29:16.680 --> 29:17.920
Let's be having you.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.360
Take your hat off, mate.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.960
Oh, on second thoughts,
put it back on.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.680
You have
information regarding

29:32.720 --> 29:35.000
the treacherous vermin
known as The Doctor.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.240
You're talking to her.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.600
What?

29:41.680 --> 29:43.960
You deceived my soldier.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.720
It wasn't difficult.

29:46.760 --> 29:50.240
It is regrettable that
our Flux strategy did not
foresee your presence

29:50.280 --> 29:51.720
but we shall not falter.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.240
You knew the Flux was coming?

29:55.280 --> 29:59.120
So, what caused it?
Is it you lot? Are the
Sontarans behind the Flux?

29:59.160 --> 30:02.160
The Flux is neither of
our making or our control.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.560
But our Psychic Command
foresaw it.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.680
We timed our attack
on this feeble rock

30:07.720 --> 30:11.400
in the fractions before
the Lupari Shield took effect.

30:11.440 --> 30:16.440
While we were all looking
the other way. You must
be very proud.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.040
This planet has defied us
ever since the great
Commander Lynx

30:20.080 --> 30:24.200
first staked his claim on the
ground of its feeble soil.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.720
We now assert that claim!

30:26.760 --> 30:31.040
Earth shall be an outpost
of the Sontaran Empire.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.640
No, it won't.

30:34.680 --> 30:37.480
But why here? Why Sebastopol?

30:37.520 --> 30:41.680
The Crimean skirmish seems
the perfect place to start.

30:41.720 --> 30:45.000
So much conflict.
So much opportunity.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.000
And also...

30:48.520 --> 30:50.440
I wanted to ride a horse.

30:53.480 --> 30:56.960
Leave this planet now
and you get to leave alive.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.040
Ugh.

31:03.160 --> 31:07.160
You think your puny words
will stand me down?

31:07.200 --> 31:11.080
There will be no battle.
I speak on behalf of all
of humanity.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.560
No, Doctor.

31:13.600 --> 31:16.200
- You do not.
- What are you doing?

31:16.240 --> 31:19.120
This woman does not speak
for the British Army.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.560
We are ready.

31:20.600 --> 31:24.400
I speak for more people than
you could possibly imagine!

31:25.200 --> 31:26.680
Don't be a fool.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.800
Call me that again, Doctor,

31:28.840 --> 31:30.240
and see if you survive.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.040
This is good sport!

31:32.680 --> 31:34.160
Soldier,

31:34.200 --> 31:37.040
escort this "Doctress"
back to the encampment.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.360
Keep your weapon
on her at all times.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.960
- Don't do this.
- It's done!

31:42.000 --> 31:45.400
Raise your arms above
your head or be shot
as a traitor immediately.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.600
Go!

31:48.640 --> 31:51.440
You speak
for no one, Doctor!

31:51.480 --> 31:54.280
Not even your pitiful self.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.440
I accept your offer

32:09.080 --> 32:11.320
of a massacre.

32:11.360 --> 32:15.360
Your blood shall soak
our uniforms,

32:15.400 --> 32:19.280
your bodies shall soften
our steps.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.560
Yes, this is as devastating
as you're imagining.

33:11.480 --> 33:14.080
Be grateful you aren't there.
And I'm sorry.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.120
Have a kip, it'll wear off
in six hours.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.560
And you'll still be alive.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.040
Options blocked off.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.240
Time to recalibrate.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.640
<i>I'm filming this </i>
for you, Doctor.

33:32.680 --> 33:37.360
<i>They've turned Liverpool docks </i>
into some sort of
space shipyard.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.160
I reckon I can get into one.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.080
I remember this.

35:01.280 --> 35:03.640
Passenger,
we are three.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.760
I'll lead.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.200
Can you repair?

35:13.240 --> 35:14.320
Yes.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.320
That's why we're here.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.200
Unsure.

35:18.240 --> 35:19.960
Come here, little thing.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.760
I said, come here.

35:25.480 --> 35:28.120
- Closer.
- Identify.

35:28.160 --> 35:31.040
Surplus of unauthorized
lifeform arrivals.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.640
We're not the first here.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.880
Identify.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.720
I am Azure.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.680
And I am your death.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.200
It's as you said.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.080
More powerful than before.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.240
Why the wait will be worth it.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.960
Now, Atropos,

36:01.400 --> 36:02.880
where it all began

36:03.680 --> 36:05.200
and will all begin again.

36:14.560 --> 36:15.640
Fire!

36:42.320 --> 36:44.840
You're still here,
on your watch. Thank you.

36:46.240 --> 36:48.200
- Mary Seacole.
- What happened?

36:48.240 --> 36:49.280
I couldn't stop them.

36:49.320 --> 36:51.600
Now the soldiers are dying.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.120
You're gonna be very busy
by day's end. I'm sorry.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.720
I noted everything.

36:57.560 --> 37:00.320
It's deserted down there now.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.200
Excellent work, Mrs Seacole.
And just as I thought.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.000
Now, given their absence,

37:05.040 --> 37:07.640
it would be churlish not
to take advantage,
don't you think?

37:07.680 --> 37:08.720
Come on.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.440
Where are we going?

37:12.760 --> 37:14.240
Half a league onward.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.760
That one
looks good, Mary.
Let's have a squiz inside.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.640
They built all of this?

37:46.680 --> 37:48.720
I mean, it's good,
but it's no British Hotel.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.400
Here we are.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.480
Double top! Get in.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.000
<i>I've snuck on board.</i>

38:19.760 --> 38:22.360
<i>Haven't seen </i>
any of the potato heads yet.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.680
<i>I'm looking for the control </i>
centre or whatever.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.760
Ah.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.200
That's more like it.

38:35.240 --> 38:39.560
Now, Mrs Seacole,
with your records,

38:40.520 --> 38:42.200
and this data,

38:42.240 --> 38:43.880
let's see
what's really going on.

38:44.840 --> 38:47.880
It is bad
to just press things?

38:47.920 --> 38:50.080
Hopefully
they won't self-destruct.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.680
<i>Or let everyone know I'm here.</i>

38:52.520 --> 38:54.280
Dan! Dan!

38:54.320 --> 38:56.160
Dan! Dan, it's me!

38:56.680 --> 38:57.720
Doctor!

38:59.040 --> 39:00.680
Where are you?

39:00.720 --> 39:02.440
- Still in the Crimea!
- Back in Liverpool.

39:02.480 --> 39:03.480
Where's Yaz?

39:04.080 --> 39:05.160
I don't know.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.720
You speak first.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.440
How are you
on a Sontaran ship?

39:09.480 --> 39:11.920
I'm back home. They've took
over Liverpool dock.

39:11.960 --> 39:16.080
<i>They're building spaceships, </i>
hundreds of them,
all along the Mersey.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.800
They're not just in
the Crimea.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.880
<i>And they've got this </i>
obsession with Japanese food.

39:20.920 --> 39:25.560
<i>I heard one of the chief </i>
Potato Heads talking about
Tempura Command.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.120
<i>Tempura Offensive.</i>

39:28.160 --> 39:29.720
<i>What's that all about?</i>

39:29.760 --> 39:32.400
Could it have been
"Temporal" Command?

39:32.440 --> 39:34.360
<i>Temporal as in time.</i>

39:34.880 --> 39:36.320
Oh, yeah.

39:36.360 --> 39:37.640
That makes more sense.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.680
<i>Hey, I've been filming </i>
everything if that helps.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.480
Good lad! Very nice.

39:42.520 --> 39:45.480
<i>Hold your phone </i>
close to the screens.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.840
<i>I can access </i>
the Sontaran data banks,

39:47.880 --> 39:49.800
plus everything
that's on your phone.

39:49.840 --> 39:52.120
What, including me photos?

39:57.560 --> 39:58.560
Of course.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.040
Temporal Offensive.

40:01.080 --> 40:04.920
They're just about to launch
a huge wave of attacks
throughout time.

40:04.960 --> 40:09.040
They're building Time ships,
so they can invade
Earth's history.

40:09.080 --> 40:12.640
And the Crimea
is the pilot scheme.

40:12.680 --> 40:16.000
<i>Earth will become a Sontaran </i>
outpost from the dawn of time.

40:17.440 --> 40:20.960
The whole history erased.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Well, you better
make sure you stop it.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.600
Is that Mary Seacole?

40:25.640 --> 40:26.840
<i>Hi, Mary.</i>

40:26.880 --> 40:27.880
Hello there.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.200
I don't understand
any of this.

40:30.240 --> 40:32.560
We have to get the Sontarans
out of the Crimea.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.040
But the rest is on you, Dan.

40:34.080 --> 40:35.880
<i>I was worried </i>
you were gonna say that.

40:35.920 --> 40:40.040
The first wave of ships
in the Sontaran Temporal
Offensive are about to launch.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.080
<i>You have to stop </i>
those ships leaving.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.600
How am I supposed to do that?

40:43.640 --> 40:45.120
What resources do you have?

40:45.160 --> 40:47.160
<i>- A wok.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, what?</i>

40:48.640 --> 40:50.240
Why have you got a wok?

40:50.280 --> 40:53.640
<i>It's me Mam's. For hitting </i>
them on the probic thingies.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.400
<i>Tracing rogue transmissions.</i>

40:56.440 --> 40:58.960
<i>Who is using this frequency?</i>

40:59.000 --> 41:01.200
- Dan, get out of there, now!
<i>- Disabling transmissions.</i>

41:01.240 --> 41:02.920
What about the plan?

41:02.960 --> 41:05.040
<i>...all rogue transmitters.</i>

41:05.440 --> 41:06.520
Doctor!

41:09.200 --> 41:11.280
Good luck, Dan.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.360
Right, Mrs Seacole, we both
have a lot of work to do.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.320
Doctor!

41:17.360 --> 41:19.840
Halt, intruder!

41:19.880 --> 41:23.920
All right, mate. I'm a little
bit lost. I was just looking
for the pier head.

41:23.960 --> 41:26.880
This is an Imperial
Sontaran Time Carrier.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.920
Unauthorised human presence

41:28.960 --> 41:32.960
shall result in immediate and
enjoyably violent execution.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.880
I'm just a tourist.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.680
Ask your boss, your Commander,
like. There he is.

41:41.880 --> 41:45.440
How'd you like that?
Pan-fried Sontaran!

41:45.480 --> 41:48.040
Now I'm gonna wok
right out of here.

41:51.560 --> 41:54.160
All right, lads. I was just
looking for the pier head.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.360
How can we fix something
that can't be touched?

41:57.400 --> 41:58.920
I have no idea.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.320
But we do.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.320
You can stand aside now.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.440
We understand exactly
what's needed here.

42:08.560 --> 42:11.400
- PRIEST
Can you repair?
- Yes.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.360
Sure. You got identification?

42:15.400 --> 42:16.840
Very good,
Yasmin Khan.

42:18.520 --> 42:20.760
Does the Doctor know you're
out this late by yourself?

42:24.920 --> 42:26.840
- I don't think
we've met before.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.560
Such linear creatures.

42:31.040 --> 42:33.640
That message, in pen,

42:33.680 --> 42:36.360
on the palm of your hand
that no one knows about.

42:37.880 --> 42:40.800
W-W-T-D-D.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.480
What would the Doctor do?

42:46.960 --> 42:48.040
How could you know that?

42:52.560 --> 42:54.240
How does she choose you?

42:55.760 --> 42:56.920
Any of you?

42:58.680 --> 43:00.720
So unremarkable.

43:00.760 --> 43:03.640
Take your hands off me
right now.

43:05.320 --> 43:06.400
You heard her.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.240
Commander Vinder.

43:11.280 --> 43:13.800
Shamed, disgraced
and rejected.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.840
Were you hoping
this could be your redemption?

43:26.080 --> 43:27.120
Try me.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.960
Stop! It won't work.

43:34.920 --> 43:37.440
- Who are you?
- I'm Azure.

43:38.680 --> 43:40.640
This is Swarm.

43:40.680 --> 43:43.640
Translations, but they'll do.

43:43.680 --> 43:46.200
Now unless you want
to upset Passenger here,

43:46.240 --> 43:48.360
take five steps to your left.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.160
The proximity.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.240
They've been quantum
locked against us,

44:03.960 --> 44:05.080
after last time.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.760
It's a good thing
you were here.

44:09.040 --> 44:12.440
- Stay there.
- PRIEST
You are not repair!

44:12.480 --> 44:14.600
You are identified!

44:14.640 --> 44:17.520
You are forbidden
from the temple.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.000
It was--

44:26.680 --> 44:29.920
You underestimated us,
you pathetic temporal hags.

44:31.280 --> 44:35.880
Your deluded, pointless lives
have led you here,

44:35.920 --> 44:38.240
to painful, powerless deaths.

44:45.160 --> 44:46.880
Two already broken.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.200
Shall I repair?

44:55.920 --> 44:57.600
Stop! You don't know
what you're doing.

45:01.160 --> 45:04.000
Don't worry.
I'm getting to you.

45:10.200 --> 45:13.920
Spying is an act of treason
against Sontar.

45:13.960 --> 45:16.640
Yeah, yeah.
I've heard all this--

45:18.320 --> 45:21.240
Troops! Prepare for execution.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.920
Ready! Aim!

45:25.960 --> 45:27.480
MALE I don't think so!

45:29.680 --> 45:31.560
I've still got a human
in this fight.

45:40.680 --> 45:43.360
You're welcome, idiot.

45:46.920 --> 45:49.360
- MRS
So many wounded.

45:50.600 --> 45:52.760
We won't save them all.

45:59.280 --> 46:02.320
All of the casualties
were ours.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.760
Soldiers pay the price for
their commanders' mistakes.

46:11.440 --> 46:13.560
They'll
attack again at first light.

46:17.840 --> 46:20.000
I don't know what to do.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.280
Help me.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.160
I'm gonna need a pointy stick.

46:33.160 --> 46:36.320
Sontarans!
Crimean Eviction.

46:36.360 --> 46:39.720
Pay attention, sit up,
back straight, hands on heads.

46:39.760 --> 46:42.000
Actually, forget about
the last one.

46:42.040 --> 46:43.640
So, here we go.

46:43.680 --> 46:47.920
Sontarans need a rest cycle
of 7.5 minutes every 27 hours,

46:47.960 --> 46:51.040
as detailed by Mrs Seacole
in her observations here

46:51.080 --> 46:53.040
and at the Sontaran
encampment.

46:53.080 --> 46:56.720
During said rest cycle, they
all go back into their ships.

46:56.760 --> 46:58.160
- Why?
- I--

46:58.200 --> 46:59.880
I'll tell you why.

46:59.920 --> 47:03.800
Because they cannot cope
with Earth's atmosphere
over an extended period.

47:03.840 --> 47:07.080
That's why they wear
the protective armoured suits.

47:07.120 --> 47:10.080
The suits filter out
harmful Earth gases

47:10.120 --> 47:14.280
and substitute them
with chemicals and nutrients
from their home planet.

47:14.320 --> 47:17.480
But the suits only have
a limited capacity.

47:17.520 --> 47:20.640
- They have to be refilled.
- From their ships.

47:20.680 --> 47:24.280
Gold star and a sticker
for Mrs Seacole.

47:24.320 --> 47:25.880
Keep up, Lieutenant General.

47:25.920 --> 47:30.160
The ships aren't just
transport, they hold
their supplies.

47:30.200 --> 47:34.720
So, for precisely 7.5 minutes
every 27 hours,

47:34.760 --> 47:36.800
the Sontarans
top up their suits

47:36.840 --> 47:39.560
via the probic vents
in the back of their necks,

47:39.600 --> 47:44.600
resting and refuelling
like cars refilling
their petrol tanks.

47:44.640 --> 47:46.520
- What--
- Wait, forget that one.

47:46.560 --> 47:51.400
Um, like horses
replenishing their nose bags.

47:51.440 --> 47:52.920
Right.

47:52.960 --> 47:56.000
So, what we're going to do

47:56.040 --> 47:59.840
is empty their ships
of those supplies,

47:59.880 --> 48:03.760
forcing a retreat out of
the Crimea back to
the 21st century,

48:03.800 --> 48:06.840
where my best person
will be there to deal
with them. Hopefully.

48:06.880 --> 48:09.120
Did you just say 21st century?

48:09.160 --> 48:10.760
Shh! She's talking!

48:10.800 --> 48:15.200
Now, if they're all on the
same timetable every day,

48:15.240 --> 48:18.560
which I bet they are,
in 38 minutes' time,

48:18.600 --> 48:20.880
they will all enter
their ships simultaneously.

48:20.920 --> 48:22.280
While they're inside,

48:22.320 --> 48:25.360
we will have exactly
7.5 minutes to drain
their supplies.

48:27.320 --> 48:29.000
Might need some
of your men to help.

48:46.760 --> 48:47.800
Ah!

48:49.360 --> 48:51.120
Right. Remember what
I taught you.

48:51.160 --> 48:54.640
- Divert this gas
into this chamber...

48:54.680 --> 48:58.440
...and it will render
the supply feed inert
and harmless to humans.

48:58.480 --> 49:03.480
Then, rip off this and let it
all leak out into the air.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.680
- Got it? Come on, General.

49:05.720 --> 49:08.240
Next ship, 6.9 minutes left.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.080
What is happening?

49:29.120 --> 49:32.480
SONTARAN
Supply levels dwindling
to critical across the fleet.

49:33.320 --> 49:35.640
Unable to refill armour.

49:48.560 --> 49:50.480
What is that useless
weapon you've got?

49:50.520 --> 49:52.560
It's a wok.

49:52.600 --> 49:54.240
You look ridiculous.

49:54.280 --> 49:56.520
Says the bloke
with the floppy ears.

49:57.440 --> 49:58.840
What are you doing here?

49:58.880 --> 50:01.000
We're still species-bonded.

50:01.040 --> 50:03.560
Clearly, you're so inept,
you can't be on your own.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.680
And, also,
this is partially our fault.

50:06.720 --> 50:08.760
The Sontaran attack force
snuck through

50:08.800 --> 50:10.880
in the second
before we sealed the shield.

50:10.920 --> 50:12.480
It's our responsibility.

50:12.520 --> 50:14.640
Well, my responsibility.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.560
Because I got the blame.
As usual.

50:16.600 --> 50:20.040
Listen, they're about
to launch timeships
into Earth's history.

50:20.080 --> 50:22.160
- I know.
- I've got a plan.

50:22.200 --> 50:24.960
- What do you mean you know?
- I intercepted
the transmissions.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.680
It's not your plan. So, don't
pretend you're clever.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.160
Alright, keep your fur on!

50:29.200 --> 50:31.360
- What are you doing?

50:31.400 --> 50:33.160
What do you think I'm doing?

50:33.200 --> 50:34.960
- I'm taking off.
- What--

50:43.680 --> 50:47.040
I understand you're having
a problem with your
supplies, Commander.

50:47.080 --> 50:48.560
Sabotage!

50:48.600 --> 50:52.560
I warned you this planet
was protected. Now, retreat.

50:52.600 --> 50:55.360
That word shall never
pass my lips!

50:57.760 --> 51:00.800
We shall make
a strategic withdrawal.

51:03.080 --> 51:04.880
But we shall return.

51:06.240 --> 51:10.520
Not while I'm around.
Now, hit the road, Skaak.

51:18.120 --> 51:19.360
What's your plan?

51:19.400 --> 51:22.400
Some clever sciency-spacey
thing I won't understand?

51:22.440 --> 51:24.320
- We're gonna ram them.
- What?

51:24.360 --> 51:26.440
We'll use this ship
as a battering ram

51:26.480 --> 51:29.320
to hit all the others,
creating a massive
temporal reaction,

51:29.360 --> 51:33.400
takes the ships and all
of the Sontarans on Earth
out of existence.

51:33.440 --> 51:36.760
- Huge temporal bang.
- Yeah, but--but
we're on this ship!

51:36.800 --> 51:38.880
There's an escape pod
down the corridor, you fool!

51:38.920 --> 51:39.960
Come on! We're out of here.

51:46.920 --> 51:50.600
- That was a great plan!
- Why did I have to get you
to protect?

51:53.000 --> 51:55.440
You could've killed me!
What are you doing?

51:55.480 --> 51:58.200
Get down there! Hurry up!

51:58.240 --> 52:00.400
- This thing's about to crash!

52:04.440 --> 52:07.600
Whoo!

52:07.640 --> 52:11.800
This is Commander Riskaw,
the fleet is under attack
from insurgents!

52:31.800 --> 52:34.080
It worked! They're leaving.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.280
And with no further bloodshed.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.880
I must disabuse you of that.

52:43.560 --> 52:45.360
What have you done?

52:45.400 --> 52:46.760
I recommend you run.

52:46.800 --> 52:48.720
Run, Doctor! Run!

52:51.480 --> 52:52.880
This is for my men!

53:05.200 --> 53:07.240
They were retreating.

53:09.280 --> 53:11.000
It was done.

53:11.040 --> 53:13.040
That was for the men
I lost today.

53:13.080 --> 53:15.000
For your guilt, you mean.

53:15.040 --> 53:18.600
Sometimes men like you make
me wonder why I bother
with humanity.

53:18.640 --> 53:22.600
I... I am grateful
that you do.

53:24.320 --> 53:27.160
Whoever you are, Doctor.

53:28.040 --> 53:30.800
I have to go
and find my friends.

53:32.560 --> 53:36.280
- I hope we meet again,
Mrs Seacole.

53:38.200 --> 53:39.920
MRS
Where are you going?

53:48.920 --> 53:50.360
I'm here.

53:54.440 --> 53:56.520
What is this thing
happening to you?

54:04.960 --> 54:06.760
What was in that tube?

54:06.800 --> 54:08.160
It was a waste tube.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.640
You're kidding me!

54:15.480 --> 54:17.040
They've gone.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.360
It's all gone.

54:19.400 --> 54:20.920
Temporal implosion.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.320
You're welcome.

54:28.400 --> 54:31.240
Oh, here
she comes, now the
hard work's been done.

54:31.280 --> 54:34.440
- You made it back
- And you got rid
of the Sontarans.

54:34.480 --> 54:37.360
It was pretty easy, really.
I worked it all out by myself,

54:37.400 --> 54:41.120
until Scooby Doo here
tried to take all the credit.

54:41.160 --> 54:44.040
I need your people
to stay protecting
this planet while I'm away.

54:44.080 --> 54:45.640
I have to find my friend.

54:46.600 --> 54:48.160
You wanna come?

54:51.560 --> 54:52.920
Okay.

54:55.400 --> 54:57.280
I'm not done with you yet.

54:57.320 --> 55:00.160
If you're going out into
the universe, you'd better
understand,

55:00.200 --> 55:02.040
it's in a bad way.

55:02.080 --> 55:05.040
The Lupari will stay,
shielding the planet.

55:05.080 --> 55:08.640
Until this is over.
If it is ever over.

55:10.360 --> 55:12.040
I hope I never see you again.

55:12.080 --> 55:13.720
Feeling's mutual.

55:27.760 --> 55:29.760
That should not
be growing out the floor.

55:32.080 --> 55:35.600
- Are these things new?
- Yeah.

55:35.640 --> 55:39.520
They weren't here
a second ago. Something's
corrupting the TARDIS.

55:44.280 --> 55:46.520
- Did you just do that?
- No.

55:51.440 --> 55:52.680
I can't make it work.

55:53.720 --> 55:55.000
We're being hijacked.

56:05.520 --> 56:08.360
- Where are we?

56:11.120 --> 56:12.760
I don't know.

56:12.800 --> 56:16.760
But the spatio-temporal
readings are at zero,
which is impossible.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.480
This way.

56:31.520 --> 56:34.200
I mean,
this is obviously a trap.

56:34.240 --> 56:36.240
And we're walking into it,
are we?

56:36.280 --> 56:38.720
I have to find Yaz.
Stay close to me.

56:38.760 --> 56:39.960
Do exactly as I say.

56:43.600 --> 56:46.600
Ah! Doctor! At last.

56:48.680 --> 56:50.080
Come.

56:50.840 --> 56:53.000
It's been a long time.

56:54.440 --> 56:56.280
I have something of yours.

56:58.840 --> 57:00.040
Come.

57:00.080 --> 57:01.560
Further.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.360
Who are they?

57:11.400 --> 57:14.240
These are
the Mouri, Doctor.

57:14.280 --> 57:16.520
The remnants of them,
at least.

57:17.360 --> 57:18.560
The Mouri...

57:19.440 --> 57:21.200
in the Temple of Atropos.

57:22.320 --> 57:24.200
On the planet Time.

57:25.080 --> 57:27.160
There is no planet
called Time.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.920
Yet here we are.

57:30.040 --> 57:32.880
The Temple of Atropos
is broken.

57:33.800 --> 57:35.840
And the Mouri are failing.

57:37.440 --> 57:40.840
Creatures who hold time
in this universe together.

57:40.880 --> 57:42.960
Broken.

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
Time is beginning to run wild.
Could really harm a TARDIS.

57:48.320 --> 57:50.600
So I made a short-term repair.

57:55.600 --> 57:58.280
- Yaz
- Doctor! Don't come near.

57:58.320 --> 58:01.520
- I've seen what he can do.
- She's right.

58:01.560 --> 58:05.160
Try to rescue them
and we'll reduce them to ash.

58:05.200 --> 58:08.200
Her and her new friend.

58:08.240 --> 58:10.720
- Will you count?
- Yes.

58:11.560 --> 58:13.120
Five.

58:13.160 --> 58:16.320
- What have you done to them?
- It's what I'm about
to do, Doctor.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.400
Four.

58:17.440 --> 58:19.880
Poor placeholders.

58:19.920 --> 58:22.200
Hardly equipped
to be Mouri, are they?

58:22.240 --> 58:24.680
- Three.
- When I click my fingers,

58:26.040 --> 58:29.160
the full force of Time
will blast through them.

58:29.200 --> 58:34.480
How many seconds will
their bodies be able to take
before they die, Doctor?

58:34.520 --> 58:35.600
Two.

58:35.640 --> 58:36.920
Stop it.

58:36.960 --> 58:39.520
You don't have to do this.
Tell me what you want.

58:39.560 --> 58:40.840
One.

58:40.880 --> 58:42.680
All in good time.

59:17.360 --> 59:18.800
On my command.

59:23.520 --> 59:26.280
<i>Time is beginning </i>
to run wild.
