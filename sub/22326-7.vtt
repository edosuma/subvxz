It is his home.

Before we knew Ezra,
we were drawn here.

There were a lot of missions

The rebels will attempt
to deliver the recorder
to the rebel command

in hopes of studying
the TIE defender design
for a weakness.

01:23.580 --> 01:25.420
The hyperdrive
is too cumbersome

01:25.420 --> 01:28.040
for the rebels to have
carried it far on foot.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.960
They must have
hidden it in the area.

eating those people,
was there?

15:50.790 --> 15:52.830
(DISTANT BOOM)
(ROCKS CLATTERING)

15:52.830 --> 15:54.670
(DISTANT EXPLOSION)
(WOLVES GROWL)

15:54.670 --> 15:56.790
The Empire's bombing
the mountains!

15:56.790 --> 15:58.790
(DETONATIONS BOOMING)
(ENGINES WHINING)

16:03.170 --> 16:04.540
We've gotta get outta here.

16:12.420 --> 16:14.170
Everyone, join hands.

16:14.170 --> 16:16.540
Ezra...
EZRA: Just do it!

16:16.540 --> 16:17.920
The cave is going to
collapse!

16:19.080 --> 16:20.790
There's no way out of here.

16:21.710 --> 16:22.830
That we know of.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.120
(MEOWS)

17:00.080 --> 17:01.290
(MEOWS)

17:05.880 --> 17:08.040
(PURRING, MEOWS)

17:21.960 --> 17:23.250
(SOFT GROWL)

17:23.250 --> 17:24.500
(SNIFFS)

17:25.460 --> 17:28.710
Uh... Where
in blazes are we?

17:28.710 --> 17:30.000
Let's find out.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.500
(GROWLING SOFTLY)

17:58.620 --> 18:01.790
Uh, you're not
going to believe this.

18:01.790 --> 18:02.960
Uh...

18:02.960 --> 18:05.460
We were in
the northern hemisphere.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.710
Now we're in
the southern hemisphere.

18:07.710 --> 18:09.210
Somehow...

18:09.210 --> 18:11.500
We've moved halfway
across the planet.

18:13.920 --> 18:17.000
I'm not even gonna ask
how we got here.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.170
Ezra, how did you know
the wolves could do that?

18:20.170 --> 18:21.620
I didn't.

18:32.290 --> 18:33.500
Kanan.

18:36.460 --> 18:39.040
Look around, Ezra.
Tell me what you see.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.830
This place reminds me
of the Jedi temple

18:43.830 --> 18:44.750
here on Lothal.

18:46.420 --> 18:49.380
The walls are...
Telling a story.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.170
There are people
coming down from the sky.

18:54.290 --> 18:56.380
I think they might be Jedi.

18:57.830 --> 18:59.830
There's a message
here for us.

19:00.460 --> 19:02.000
Because we're Jedi?

19:04.420 --> 19:06.080
(IN DEEP VOICE) Dume.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.210
What does that mean?
The wolf said it before.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.880
Dume is my name.

19:18.330 --> 19:21.000
Caleb Dume is the name
I was born with.

19:25.170 --> 19:27.670
Wh... How does
the wolf know that?

19:32.460 --> 19:34.460
(SNORTING SOFTLY)

19:35.880 --> 19:37.880
It has a deep connection
to the Force,

19:38.920 --> 19:40.880
to the energy of this planet.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.330
EZRA: Don't all living things?

19:44.330 --> 19:45.540
This is different...

19:46.000 --> 19:47.330
More focused,

19:47.960 --> 19:49.330
like it has a purpose.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.880
EZRA: And we're a part of it.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.960
I'm getting a feeling
building the TIE defender

19:56.960 --> 19:59.790
isn't the worst thing
the Empire's doing here.

19:59.790 --> 20:01.540
There's something else...

20:01.540 --> 20:03.080
Something more...

20:03.080 --> 20:04.830
Sinister.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.000
WOLF: Dume.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.920
So... All the paths
are coming together, right?

20:22.920 --> 20:26.960
Yeah. I'm just not sure
if we're going to like
where they lead.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.210
Do we ever?

20:29.210 --> 20:32.080
(SCOFFS)
No. And yes.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.330
I wonder if Hera made it.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.880
I know she did.
