A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:13.480 --> 00:16.720
Good morning. It is 7 a.m.
Time to wake up.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.440
Thank you, Circé.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.520
You're welcome.

00:21.920 --> 00:22.920
Good morning.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.320
Letting yourself go, Dumont.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.520
It is seven degrees in Paris,
with cloudy skies.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.840
Wear undershirts today, kids.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.000
Go on, hurry.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.320
-Thanks, Circé.
-You're welcome.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.280
Circé, play "I Can See Clearly Now."

00:47.360 --> 00:49.800
I'm sorry.
I don't understand your request.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.200
-"I Can See Clearly Now."
-OK.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.880
-I'll play that track.
-She likes you better.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.680
Hey, don't be jealous.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.920
I'm not jealous.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.280
Chop-chop. Hurry up.
Go on! Go around, sweetie.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.360
Come on, time to get this started.

01:45.440 --> 01:46.720
Don't worry, Dumont.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.080
That's precisely the plan.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.040
Anything else?

02:02.120 --> 02:06.280
A neighborhood association opposing
the opening of a roof terrace eatery

02:06.360 --> 02:07.920
on rue Vieille-du-Temple.

02:08.760 --> 02:12.680
Yuppies worried about
their apartment's value going down.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.440
They're my constituents.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.200
We'll shake them up
if they get on my nerves…

02:18.040 --> 02:19.080
Yes?

02:20.440 --> 02:21.320
Me?

02:23.120 --> 02:24.640
-Excuse me.
-Please.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.760
-What is it?
-I'm from IT.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.160
-Yes, and?
-You have an office here?

02:31.880 --> 02:34.000
I must've set foot in it twice. Why?

02:34.080 --> 02:36.320
I've had to update the computer.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.880
-And I found some things.
-What?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.640
Well, kind of steamy stuff.

02:43.560 --> 02:44.600
Porn.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.240
What's this bullshit?

02:53.720 --> 02:58.120
-You think I'm here to look at porn?
-It'd be more convenient in your home.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.400
Are you stupid or what?

03:01.480 --> 03:02.760
I don't watch porn.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.280
I'm the last person who would judge you.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.720
You're pissing me off.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.520
I have work to do.
Erase all that and let's leave it at that.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.320
-OK?
-I won't erase anything.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.360
I won't touch your computer!

03:14.440 --> 03:17.040
If you want it erased, erase it yourself.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.480
Or not! Anyway, I have to file a report.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.280
-Hello. Is the meeting over already?
-No.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.760
- Computer issues.
-Yes.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.280
Michael isn't here?

03:29.480 --> 03:31.080
-Michael?
-Well, yes.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.840
Tall, brown hair. Bit listless.
It's his job.

03:35.320 --> 03:38.320
Well, no, Michael isn't here.
He's on leave.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.600
I'm filling in for him.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.960
Show your papers.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.160
-You show your papers!
-Excuse me?

03:47.240 --> 03:50.840
You're rude, so I'm rude too!
Besides, I don't give a damn!

03:50.920 --> 03:52.960
Not my job to erase your porn!

03:53.040 --> 03:55.080
Seriously! And "your papers"!

03:55.600 --> 03:57.440
-That's borderline racist. Here!
-Ok!

03:57.520 --> 03:59.120
-Let's not get worked up.
-I'm not!

03:59.200 --> 04:01.120
-Where is this office?
-It's this way.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.320
-Very well, let's go.
-Let's go.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.760
Have a nice day, madam.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.400
This isn't the office at all.
Where are we?

04:11.480 --> 04:13.120
We're almost there.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.000
-Heard of energy points?
-What?

04:17.920 --> 04:19.040
Well, now you know.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.360
Not too hard waking up?

05:41.240 --> 05:44.120
-Where am I?
-The question isn't where.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.080
But why?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.480
-Who are you?
-Wrong question again.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.120
You need to focus, Dumont.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.680
We're going back in time.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.320
Remember him?

06:17.440 --> 06:18.440
I understand.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.440
Memory gets bad with age. It's normal.

06:24.680 --> 06:25.680
Don't worry.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.720
I'll help you remember.

06:31.960 --> 06:32.960
Get comfortable.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.480
We have plenty of time.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.840
Ah, Dumont.

06:56.440 --> 06:57.960
How's the investigation?

06:58.040 --> 06:59.760
Mr. Diop continues to deny the facts.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.360
He's a clever old monkey.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.360
Poor choice of words. I…

07:05.120 --> 07:07.520
I meant it was to be expected.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.960
All guilty people deny.

07:09.440 --> 07:12.760
So do the innocent.
Without a necklace, he'll be let go.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.320
Are you kidding?
His prints are all over my safe.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.160
He has to confess. Do your job.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.240
Sir, I am precisely doing my job.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.800
You had the necklace insurance policy
increased before it was stolen.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.520
Why did you do that?

07:27.600 --> 07:29.280
I talked to a collector

07:29.360 --> 07:32.000
who told me
that it was largely underpriced.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.920
-I can give you his contact details.
-Yes, please.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.680
Another thing.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.960
Mr. Diop has no criminal record.
He's peaceful and kind.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.880
Did you know
he's raising his son by himself?

07:43.960 --> 07:45.520
-No.
-Yes.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.600
He doesn't fit the profile.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.120
Because there's a profile?

07:52.960 --> 07:54.120
No, you're right.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.680
The worst crooks can be above suspicion.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.160
What exactly are you playing at, Dumont?

08:02.800 --> 08:04.160
No, I'm not playing.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.520
I'm trying to get to the truth.

08:08.760 --> 08:09.760
See you soon?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.280
As soon as I know more.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.080
And what about this?

08:21.600 --> 08:24.200
Babakar Diop's deposition. Dumont.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.760
The investigation report. Dumont.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.520
The autopsy report. Dumont.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.560
Your name is everywhere.

08:35.560 --> 08:39.000
So what? That's normal.
I was in charge of the investigation.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.920
You call this an investigation?

08:44.480 --> 08:45.960
Why did you frame him?

08:48.160 --> 08:51.200
What are you talking about?
I didn't frame anyone!

08:51.280 --> 08:52.960
You didn't search very hard.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.320
You never found that necklace.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.520
All you had was a vague suspect.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.240
A bullshit reduced sentence
for a bullshit confession.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.200
Your investigation is full of shit.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.200
You did a shit job.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.240
You don't know anything.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.560
If I don't know anything…
explain it to me.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.120
Go ahead.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.480
Why insist on that confession?

09:25.240 --> 09:26.920
He wouldn't back down.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.880
Because he was innocent!

09:28.960 --> 09:30.160
Give it a rest.

09:30.800 --> 09:34.520
I've been a cop for over 30 years.
I've seen innocent people.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.440
Your Babakar was guilty.
There was evidence, a motive.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.480
Yeah, sure.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.040
He killed himself out of guilt?

09:42.120 --> 09:44.360
There, see… You're starting to get it.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.040
Why are you telling me about this?

09:56.960 --> 09:57.960
Why now?

10:03.200 --> 10:05.920
Anything to do with
the burglary at the Louvre?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.400
The same necklace, 25 years later.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.840
Bit of a connection, right?

10:26.720 --> 10:30.080
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT - DUMONT
PELLEGRINI NECKLACE 1995

10:31.080 --> 10:32.920
Yeah. The reference?

10:33.720 --> 10:36.480
It's 95-CF-JRT-43.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.320
I think
there are pages missing in the file.

10:40.760 --> 10:41.760
Are you sure?

10:43.040 --> 10:44.320
OK, thank you.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.520
-What?
-Dumont was kidnapped.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.200
-What?
-OK, everybody. Listen to me.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.720
Commissioner Dumont is missing.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.040
He was at city hall
in the 3rd arrondissement.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.440
He left the meeting with a guy.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.920
-No news since.
-Is there a description?

11:02.000 --> 11:05.440
Not yet. You and Guédira,
interview everyone at city hall.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.680
Hey! I want all hands on deck.
Understood? Go!

11:09.880 --> 11:10.880
Get up, Dumont.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.440
Your life is a success.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.760
Lovely children, a loving wife.
You spoil them.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.800
But I have a question.

11:24.280 --> 11:28.280
How much does a commissioner make?
Six, seven thousand euros a month?

11:28.360 --> 11:31.080
Even with overtime,
the numbers don't add up.

11:32.760 --> 11:36.120
Earlier, it was Babakar Diop.
Now my salary is the problem?

11:36.600 --> 11:39.200
Ludovic Reynaud, drug squad regular.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.480
His thing is coke.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.120
Showbiz, fashion, parties, big and small.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.920
Damir Cilic.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.120
Ten years in Fresnes
for armed robbery, pimping.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.400
Trafficking girls from the East,
including minors.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.480
Already less glamorous.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.520
The money isn't wired
to your savings account.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.480
I had to do some digging.

12:01.560 --> 12:04.000
Banking secrecy isn't what it used to be.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.680
Those two paid for lots of vacations.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.960
Well, Commissioner?

12:08.920 --> 12:10.360
Were you doing your job then?

12:12.560 --> 12:15.520
-You'll denounce me to Internal Affairs?
-No.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.680
Internal affairs is no fun.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.080
Your wife.

12:21.720 --> 12:22.720
No, not that.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.680
It's up to you.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.960
Tell me why you framed Babakar.
We'll forget the rest.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.520
What do you want to hear?

12:31.360 --> 12:33.200
I did my job. I caught the guy!

12:33.280 --> 12:36.720
He hanged himself.
Very sad, but it's not my problem.

12:38.760 --> 12:39.760
Have it your way.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.320
-Hello?
-Hélène?

12:51.720 --> 12:53.200
Hélène, it's me. Gabriel.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.560
-I'm OK.
-Hello?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.200
Hélène, it's me.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.800
Save it. She can't hear you.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.800
-Not yet.
-Hello, Gabriel?

13:03.880 --> 13:06.240
Gabriel, is that you? Hello!

13:06.320 --> 13:08.800
-Last chance, Dumont.
-Hello!

13:09.840 --> 13:11.800
-Answer!
-Go to hell! You hear me?

13:13.080 --> 13:15.240
You want to rat me out? Do it.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.600
Yes, I took the cash.

13:16.680 --> 13:19.400
I didn't spend it on watches or coke.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.040
The money was for my kids!

13:22.040 --> 13:23.400
I'd do anything for them.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.600
Even the stupidest shit.

13:31.040 --> 13:31.920
And Babakar...

13:32.720 --> 13:36.280
-he fucked up for his kid too.
-What do you know about that?

13:36.760 --> 13:38.800
Fresh off the boat from Senegal.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.760
Not a penny to his name.

13:40.840 --> 13:42.040
A kid to raise…

13:42.120 --> 13:43.040
I get it.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.640
-Maybe I would've done the same thing.
-Impossible.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.560
You were pressured into framing him.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.680
No need.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.800
Believe it or not,
I liked my job back then.

13:56.880 --> 13:57.880
I was good at it.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.440
I'd like some water.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.360
Please. I can't take it anymore.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.640
-Hi, Claire.
-Hi, how's it going?

14:55.040 --> 14:55.880
Great.

14:56.920 --> 15:00.400
Did you think of something
for Raoul's birthday?

15:03.640 --> 15:04.480
Hello?

15:05.680 --> 15:07.480
-Yes.
-You forgot?

15:08.160 --> 15:09.080
You're crazy.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.200
Me, forget my son's birthday?
You're nuts.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.360
I thought of something.
But it's a surprise.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.800
Assane, do you remember
you said the same thing last year?

15:21.720 --> 15:23.200
I really have a surprise.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.400
You're too much.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.000
What's keeping you so busy?

15:29.080 --> 15:30.080
It's crazy.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.680
-Filing away some old paperwork.
-I'm not an idiot.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.960
I know that's not true.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.720
You don't have to lie to me.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.080
I don't know what you're doing.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.640
I'm not sure I want to know.
Do I want to know?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.360
No, you don't.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.320
That bad?

15:53.240 --> 15:54.160
That bad.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.560
You know you can talk to me.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.280
I'm your buddy,
even if we're not having sex.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.200
I know.

16:05.920 --> 16:06.920
Thanks, buddy.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.200
-You take care of yourself, OK?
-Promise.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.200
-Don't do anything stupid, OK?
-Never.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.280
Bye.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.920
Take care of yourself.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.240
Have a nice day.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.000
Hey, Claire.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.880
Hi, how's it going?

16:49.680 --> 16:51.240
Want some help with your homework?

16:56.280 --> 16:57.760
Give me a private lesson?

16:58.400 --> 16:59.360
What's that?

17:00.480 --> 17:01.320
You're shy!

17:02.840 --> 17:05.120
-You're cute.
-Sorry, I'm late.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.560
-Who's that?
-A new kid.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.560
-Your boyfriend?
-Which is yours?

17:09.640 --> 17:10.760
What did you say?

17:12.560 --> 17:14.280
Take your seats now. Quietly.

17:15.040 --> 17:15.880
Dumbass.

17:25.120 --> 17:26.120
You OK?

17:27.080 --> 17:29.680
Not really.
I don't know how to thank you.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.160
I'll tell you something.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.360
There are two kinds of guys.
The barbarians and the knights.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.480
The barbarians don't care.
They invade your space.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.800
You have the knights, a bit like you,

17:42.880 --> 17:45.360
who think that women are fragile things

17:45.440 --> 17:47.280
that always need protecting.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.720
It's funny. Both annoy the hell out of me.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.320
-You're Assane?
-Yeah.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.680
Heard about your dad.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.840
-I'm sorry.
-Silence.

18:10.680 --> 18:14.000
Sir Knight, won't you get settled in?
Take off your coat?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.760
-My name's Claire.
-Nice to meet you.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.920
-They came down together?
-Belkacem?

18:46.440 --> 18:47.280
OK, great.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.320
-Well?
-I might have something.

18:51.400 --> 18:55.320
This van was circling for an hour.
Last seen after the kidnapping.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.400
Going north. Lost it on Magenta.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.080
I ran the license plates.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.080
-Is this your guy?
-Yeah, with the hat.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.880
-Anything clearer?
-No.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.600
And Dumont's cell phone?

19:09.720 --> 19:11.880
It was off
three minutes after the meeting.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.320
Orange Hat must've gotten rid of it.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.600
How long has Dumont had the phone?

19:17.280 --> 19:18.400
Why?

19:18.480 --> 19:20.880
They updated the chipsets
on police phones.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.440
GPSs have autonomous batteries.
We can track it down.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.960
-OK.
-I'll try.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.200
Well, go. Move it.

19:29.280 --> 19:32.520
-It's the same principle as the--
-Who cares? Go.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.480
I hope it won't take too long
and the battery is still active.

19:42.880 --> 19:43.960
All right, Dumont.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.080
I know your whole life. Your whole family.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.160
"Being perfect is…"

19:55.240 --> 19:58.000
-Touch my kids, I'll kill you.
-Calm down.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.680
I'd never touch your kids.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.480
On the other hand…

20:07.400 --> 20:09.080
Letting yourself go, Dumont.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.520
You're a fucking loser, Dumont.

20:13.520 --> 20:14.880
It's called a deepfake.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.760
Watch. It's really fun.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.480
Why won't you tell me the truth?

20:22.560 --> 20:25.480
Corruption is my passion.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.920
-Bastard.
-I have your voice.

20:29.720 --> 20:33.120
Your face, expressions and body language.
Hours' worth.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.800
You'll say whatever I want.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.760
News networks could get a video
saying you're into ISIS…

20:38.840 --> 20:40.240
Or little boys.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.840
I love hanging around schools after class.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.520
-I can choose.
-You're a fucking sicko.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.520
-What do you want?
-Just the truth.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.760
I've already told you the truth!

20:50.840 --> 20:53.720
-You don't want it!
-Quit fucking lying!

20:53.800 --> 20:54.880
Stop it!

20:55.560 --> 20:57.520
Tell me why you framed my father!

21:04.480 --> 21:05.320
Assane?

21:11.200 --> 21:12.080
Assane Diop?

21:16.920 --> 21:17.760
Assane…

21:18.880 --> 21:19.800
is that you?

21:25.400 --> 21:26.240
There…

21:26.320 --> 21:29.680
-You know what you're doing?
-Can't go faster on 128 bits.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.200
-Who cares? Hurry!
-Guys.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.120
The van is at Pantin. Let's go?

21:33.200 --> 21:37.000
We wait to see if the phone is in it.
The van could be a decoy.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.120
-Where are we at?
-The van is at Pantin.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.760
Waiting on the phone.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.560
Provided Mr. Guédira figures it out,
because...

21:51.920 --> 21:54.800
-We got it!
-OK. We have Dumont. He's at Pantin!

21:54.880 --> 21:56.600
Come on, all hands on deck!

21:56.680 --> 21:58.720
Perraud, Moretti, let's move!

21:58.800 --> 22:02.080
Everyone at Pantin! Go! Move it!

22:03.000 --> 22:03.840
Assane…

22:05.360 --> 22:06.200
are you there?

22:07.480 --> 22:08.960
You know, I remember you.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.880
I was young. Trying to look tough.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.000
It wasn't right, what I said.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.200
Please forgive me.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.320
Your dad was a good man.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.080
Just tell yourself he was tempted.
That's all.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.600
It happens to everyone. I should know.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.960
You say I forced him to lie.
What are you doing?

22:45.200 --> 22:48.480
The only difference is that I am innocent.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.760
I want to see my family again.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.240
You have a family too.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.080
Think of them.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.440
Untie me and disappear.

23:05.640 --> 23:06.840
I won't rat you out.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.600
I promise you.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.240
Hey, guys. Look.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.320
Claire and the Black kid!

23:18.400 --> 23:19.280
No way.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.440
Come on, guys!

23:24.400 --> 23:26.840
-How is your book?
-Awesome.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.240
-Lupin's kind of a Romeo, right?
-Meaning?

23:31.320 --> 23:33.480
He's got game. He gets tons of girls.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.840
Yeah, he gets around.

23:36.440 --> 23:37.640
OK, great.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.480
No, that's not what I meant.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.240
He's always onto something.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.760
-He's not afraid.
-What's up, lovebirds?

23:45.560 --> 23:47.720
Don't move. It's like with bears.

23:47.800 --> 23:51.000
-Play dead, they go away. OK?
-That hasn't been proven.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.920
-Think they've slept together?
-Your scarf…

23:56.160 --> 23:58.960
-Remember the barbarians? The knights?
-Don't worry.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.400
Sorry.

24:09.440 --> 24:10.720
You're a total moron.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.200
-Assane?
-What?

24:19.280 --> 24:20.400
What do you mean "what?"

24:20.880 --> 24:23.560
I don't need a boyfriend.
I'm fine on my own.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.320
You don't know.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.520
-What?
-I'm the man of your life.

24:29.920 --> 24:34.000
Yeah, OK…
You're the only guy I can stand. So, yes.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.320
-Wait.
-What?

24:35.400 --> 24:37.800
The man of your life, but no hooking up?

24:37.880 --> 24:40.480
Yeah, that's it!
You're not stupid after all.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.640
Now let me treat this, please.

24:42.720 --> 24:43.560
Sorry.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.920
And stop moving!

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
-Wait.
-What?

24:47.640 --> 24:48.840
How does it work?

24:50.280 --> 24:51.120
No!

24:51.800 --> 24:52.880
"When Lupin loses…

24:53.760 --> 24:54.800
he still wins."

24:57.880 --> 25:00.760
-Stop pressing on it!
-I'm not. I'm cleaning it!

25:06.040 --> 25:08.080
Still at Pantin. No good if the GPS dies.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.840
Go on, move! Move it!

25:11.920 --> 25:12.800
Move!

25:22.480 --> 25:23.480
You know…

25:26.680 --> 25:27.720
I always say…

25:29.960 --> 25:31.160
one does not change.

25:33.720 --> 25:36.680
But I'd like to change my mind about you.

25:38.600 --> 25:39.920
I want to believe you.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.960
You're not a knight,
but not a barbarian either.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.440
So, I forgive you, Dumont.

25:49.880 --> 25:55.080
TIME ELAPSED

26:10.440 --> 26:12.680
-Police! Freeze!
-I didn't do nothing.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.760
-What do you have on you?
-Nothing.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.040
Anything dangerous?

26:22.120 --> 26:23.240
Easy.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.480
Shit, he's laughing at us.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.080
This is pointless, boss.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.520
He's been leading us on!

26:40.600 --> 26:41.680
He could be anywhere.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.240
Bring him over.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.080
-What's this shit?
-I don't know.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.040
Orange Hat, don't you know him?

26:49.120 --> 26:51.920
He put an ad online.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.320
Two hundred euros to carry some gear
from the city hall.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.240
-Playing us.
-Didn't ask for details.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.920
We saw you with him.
Where did you drop him off?

27:00.400 --> 27:03.360
-City hall in the 3rd.
-Are you listening or what?

27:03.440 --> 27:06.320
We're asking where you dropped him off!

27:06.400 --> 27:07.920
City hall in the 3rd!

27:08.840 --> 27:11.360
He said to go around the block.
He got out.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.800
I was supposed to wait here.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.840
-So, he's not coming back?
-Get him out of here.

27:20.520 --> 27:21.600
He's at city hall.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.080
-What?
-What makes you think that?

27:25.160 --> 27:27.360
He kidnaps someone and stays on site?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.400
Who would be stupid enough to do that?

27:30.480 --> 27:31.640
Arsène Lupin.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.920
-He does that in a book.
-Arsène Lupin…

27:59.720 --> 28:02.200
Check all the floors! The basement!

28:05.840 --> 28:06.680
Clear!

28:07.560 --> 28:09.080
Go! Move it!

28:21.080 --> 28:21.960
Are you OK?

28:23.520 --> 28:24.360
Commissioner?

28:26.160 --> 28:28.640
-We have the commissioner.
-Son of a bitch.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.880
ARSÈNE LUPIN
GENTLEMAN BURGLAR

28:33.840 --> 28:36.040
Don't you get tired of the same book?

28:36.120 --> 28:38.080
I learn something new every time.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.560
I was thinking about
the two kinds of guys.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.320
-Yeah?
-I think there's a third kind.

28:46.480 --> 28:50.360
This guy doesn't care about anything,
except what really matters.

28:51.800 --> 28:55.000
A guy who plays the game
but who respects the rules.

28:56.520 --> 28:59.360
-Who is this third guy?
-A gentleman.

29:02.800 --> 29:03.640
What?

29:14.440 --> 29:15.760
I like being with you.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.800
Hey, don't get carried away.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.640
It's not…

29:25.320 --> 29:28.040
I like the idea
we'll always be there for each other.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.320
Works for me.

29:31.480 --> 29:32.320
Works for you?

29:33.160 --> 29:35.480
You told me not to get carried away.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.600
-So, a gentleman?
-Exactly.

29:46.760 --> 29:49.360
Dumont got kidnapped by a guy

29:49.440 --> 29:51.280
he can't describe in detail.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.880
He locks him up for four hours,
without saying anything,

29:54.960 --> 29:56.400
and then he just leaves?

29:56.920 --> 29:58.760
Sorry, boss. It makes no sense.

30:01.560 --> 30:02.840
We agree. It makes no sense.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.760
But then, why would Dumont lie?

30:06.560 --> 30:08.760
Commissioner Dumont, Belkacem.

30:09.880 --> 30:12.120
Besides, he put his own guys on the case.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.520
Back to the necklace. Where are you at?

30:14.600 --> 30:15.960
Still on Paul Sernine.

30:16.040 --> 30:18.920
His social media profiles
were all totally bogus.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.520
Boss? Can I talk to you?
It's about the necklace.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.240
No, please. Not Lupin.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.360
Orange Hat, who kidnapped Dumont,

30:30.880 --> 30:32.120
I think it's Paul Sernine.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.160
What are you saying?

30:35.040 --> 30:36.480
They're the same person?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.640
-Yes.
-What are you saying?

30:39.400 --> 30:41.440
-What's the link?
-The link…

30:43.360 --> 30:44.320
It's right here.

30:46.560 --> 30:49.360
Dumont was in charge
of the first investigation.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.240
LT. DUMONT
PARIS REGIONAL POLICE

32:33.080 --> 32:34.000
Damn…

33:55.000 --> 33:55.840
I quit.

33:59.600 --> 34:00.440
So…

34:01.440 --> 34:03.120
you think he's innocent.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.720
I checked his schedule on the day.
He couldn't have visited.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.520
And the prints on my safe?

34:10.520 --> 34:13.400
The lab guys think they were planted.

34:14.080 --> 34:14.920
Really?

34:15.920 --> 34:17.320
Fascinating story.

34:18.200 --> 34:19.360
Who could have done it?

34:23.280 --> 34:25.840
I think you have thoughts on the matter.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.880
You're unfamiliar with the administration

34:31.960 --> 34:33.440
in which you are working.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.400
Let me save you some time.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.160
I know you play golf with my boss.

34:40.240 --> 34:42.840
You're close
to the minister of the interior,

34:42.920 --> 34:44.920
but I'm going to see this through.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.520
How is your wife?

34:49.600 --> 34:51.320
Hélène, I believe?

34:52.280 --> 34:53.720
A pediatric nurse,

34:53.800 --> 34:56.240
variable hours, lots of driving at night.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.040
How brave.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.360
I'm a good investigator too.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.880
All of this is a game, Lieutenant.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.160
A game with rules.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.040
And I make them.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.360
Here's how this is going to go down.

35:13.880 --> 35:17.120
Babakar will sign a confession.
You'll solve a big case.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.720
-It'll launch your career.
-He will never sign.

35:20.800 --> 35:21.640
He will.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.800
You've just had a brilliant idea.

35:25.840 --> 35:28.240
My wife will ask him to sign

35:29.200 --> 35:31.440
for a significantly reduced sentence.

35:32.800 --> 35:33.920
And everybody wins.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.720
If he doesn't return the necklace,

35:38.640 --> 35:40.640
he'll get the maximum sentence.

35:41.160 --> 35:42.000
Probably.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.000
But he doesn't know that.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.680
My wife mustn't know it either.

35:50.680 --> 35:51.880
Come on, Dumont.

35:53.560 --> 35:56.120
The police are going to need
people like you.

35:56.600 --> 35:57.440
I…

35:58.480 --> 35:59.920
need you right now.

36:03.120 --> 36:03.960
Still no?

36:22.960 --> 36:23.800
For Assane.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.400
One does not change.

36:42.040 --> 36:44.960
I'd like to change my mind.
I want to believe you.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.760
I forgive you, Dumont.

37:34.360 --> 37:35.200
Good evening.

37:37.640 --> 37:40.000
Quite an ordeal, but everything is fine.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.160
I need to talk to you.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.760
It's about Babakar Diop.

37:48.840 --> 37:50.880
There's a new player involved.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.080
I'm sorry, you're right.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.920
OK. I'll be there.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.560
Good night, Mr. Pellegrini.

38:11.360 --> 38:12.200
Gabriel?

38:15.560 --> 38:16.400
Gabriel!

38:18.680 --> 38:21.240
My love, you're here!

38:22.200 --> 38:23.560
Everything's fine.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.280
OK, Circé. "I Can See Clearly Now."

38:38.480 --> 38:40.480
One does not change

38:42.200 --> 38:43.320
Oh, Circé!

38:43.400 --> 38:46.000
-Sorry. I don't understand.
-I think she's jealous.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.480
Circé?

38:49.560 --> 38:51.560
Sorry. I don't understand your request.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.720
-Please, repeat--
-Good evening.

38:56.560 --> 38:59.000
Quite an ordeal, but everything is fine.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.080
-Circé!
-I need to talk to you.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.720
-Stop, Circé!
-Sorry. I don't understand your request.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.200
-Stop!
-I'm sorry.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.280
Stop, dammit!

39:10.080 --> 39:12.920
-I don't understand your request.
-…Babakar Diop…

39:16.760 --> 39:17.760
…Mr. Pellegrini.

39:18.520 --> 39:22.800
Good night, Mr. Pellegrini.

39:22.880 --> 39:27.000
Good night, Mr. Pellegrini.

39:27.080 --> 39:30.200
Good night, Mr. Pellegrini.
I need to talk to you.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.600
It's about Babakar Diop.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.360
There's a new player involved.
