03:48.287 --> 03:49.921
I'm going to London.

03:49.954 --> 03:52.157
I knew you would be.

Don't you need socks?

04:18.450 --> 04:20.084
Socks.

04:23.589 --> 04:27.559
This was one of the first times
your mum and me went to London.

04:27.593 --> 04:29.428
God, the shops.

04:29.461 --> 04:31.597
We used to look
at all the clothes.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.465
Liberty. Selfridges.

04:33.499 --> 04:35.100
Carnaby street.

04:35.134 --> 04:37.078
The snooty shopgirls knew
we couldn't afford anything,

04:37.102 --> 04:39.171
but they didn't know
we could copy it.

04:41.273 --> 04:42.441
Take it.

04:42.474 --> 04:44.143
No, I can't, gran.

04:44.976 --> 04:46.445
Bring her up when I'm settled.

04:46.478 --> 04:49.615
We'll have dinner at the
criterion, like in the photo.

04:49.648 --> 04:51.450
We didn't eat there.
Couldn't afford to.

04:51.483 --> 04:53.951
Just took a picture outside
and went to a wimpy.

04:53.985 --> 04:57.222
When I'm a big-time
fashion designer, we'll go.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.457
Deal?

04:58.490 --> 05:00.858
I don't think wimpy still exist.

05:00.892 --> 05:03.228
You know what I mean.

05:05.164 --> 05:07.366
I know how much you want this.

05:07.399 --> 05:08.600
It was her dream, too,

05:08.634 --> 05:10.469
but it's not
what you imagine, London.

05:10.502 --> 05:11.936
Gran.

05:11.969 --> 05:13.214
You've got to look out
for yourself.

05:13.238 --> 05:15.040
- I know.
- But I'm gonna say it anyway.

05:15.074 --> 05:16.651
- There are lots of bad guys.
- You've got to be careful.

05:16.675 --> 05:18.453
- There's lots of bad people.
- I'll be careful.

05:18.477 --> 05:19.877
They're bad apples.

05:19.911 --> 05:23.115
I'm scrappy. I can take 'em.

05:25.684 --> 05:29.121
I'm just saying,
London can be a lot.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.490
It was too much
for your mum, perhaps,

05:31.523 --> 05:34.493
and she didn't have your gift.

05:34.526 --> 05:36.161
My gift?

05:36.195 --> 05:39.631
She didn't feel things,
see things like you do.

05:39.665 --> 05:43.135
I... I worry you'll get
all overwhelmed again.

05:43.168 --> 05:47.272
Gran, it's... it's not just
that I need to do this for me.

05:48.640 --> 05:53.010
I really want to, for her.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.980
And maybe it won't be so bad.

05:56.013 --> 05:59.418
Maybe up there, I won't be
reminded of her so much.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.255
Okay.

06:03.288 --> 06:04.956
Besides...

06:04.989 --> 06:07.992
I haven't even seen mum in ages.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.911
Bye.

06:35.053 --> 06:36.954
You'll call?

06:36.988 --> 06:38.290
You know I will.

06:38.323 --> 06:40.492
And if it all gets
too much in there,

06:40.526 --> 06:41.527
you'll tell me?

06:41.560 --> 06:43.262
In the city?

06:43.295 --> 06:44.530
In here.

06:44.563 --> 06:46.165
Please don't do that
to yourself.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.567
Don't do it to me, okay?

06:48.600 --> 06:50.469
I love you.

06:52.337 --> 06:54.206
Oh, Ellie.

06:57.776 --> 07:00.646

What brings you down, then?

08:19.758 --> 08:21.393
London college of fashion.

08:21.426 --> 08:23.395
So, you're a model?

08:23.428 --> 08:25.364
No.

08:25.397 --> 08:26.732
I design clothes.

08:26.765 --> 08:28.534
Well, I want to. I mean...

08:28.567 --> 08:30.369
I want to be a designer.

08:30.402 --> 08:32.437
Yeah, but you could be
a model, couldn't you?

08:32.471 --> 08:33.739

08:37.174 --> 08:39.144
<i>So, what's in
Charlotte street, then?</i>

08:39.177 --> 08:40.779
Uh, student housing.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.481
It's all girls in that building?

08:42.514 --> 08:44.292
If all you supermodels are
gonna be in Charlotte street,

08:44.316 --> 08:45.760
you'll see plenty of me,
don't you worry.

08:45.784 --> 08:47.619
You might have found
your first stalker.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.221
I'll get out here.

08:49.254 --> 08:50.798
Oh, no, it's a couple
more streets, love.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.424
No, I haven't got enough cash.

08:52.457 --> 08:54.135
Oh, I'm sure we could sort
something out, sweetheart.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.094
Plus, it's not good
round here at night

08:56.128 --> 08:57.138
for young girls on their own.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.463
I want to go to the shop anyway.

08:58.497 --> 08:59.665
Please yourself.

09:12.144 --> 09:13.745
Excuse me.

09:13.779 --> 09:15.747
Can I help you?

09:15.781 --> 09:18.083
Uh, sorry.

09:36.835 --> 09:38.637
Hey, do you want a hand?

09:38.670 --> 09:40.172
Fine.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.207
You don't look fine.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.142
Well, I am.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.819
- Are you Eloise?
- Yeah.

09:53.852 --> 09:55.787
Yeah, you-you look
like an Eloise.

09:55.821 --> 09:57.623
Well, Ellie.

09:57.656 --> 09:59.591
I'm jocasta.

09:59.625 --> 10:01.436
Did they spell your surname
wrong or something?

10:01.460 --> 10:03.571
Oh, no, I've just decided
to drop it because I feel like

10:03.595 --> 10:04.930
it's way more singular
to be known

10:04.963 --> 10:06.398
by just your Christian name.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.233
You know, like,
so famous in your work

10:08.266 --> 10:09.835
that you can actually
just go by Kylie.

10:09.868 --> 10:11.903
- Minogue?
- Jenner.

10:11.937 --> 10:13.505
Oh.

10:13.538 --> 10:16.642
Okay, bad example, but...
How many jocastas do you know?

10:16.675 --> 10:17.709
None.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.378
Exactly, babes.

10:20.612 --> 10:23.515
You don't mind I snagged
the bed by the window, do you?

10:23.548 --> 10:25.517
- No.
- If we don't end up throttling each other,

10:25.550 --> 10:27.686
we could maybe talk about
switching next term.

10:27.719 --> 10:28.920
Yeah.

10:28.954 --> 10:31.189
- So, where are you from?
- Uh, redruth.

10:31.223 --> 10:32.524
It's in cornwall.

10:32.557 --> 10:33.458
I'm sorry.

10:33.492 --> 10:36.194
You know, cornwall,
in the countryside.

10:36.228 --> 10:37.305
No, no, I-I heard you, babes.

10:37.329 --> 10:38.630
I'm just, I'm sorry.

10:39.698 --> 10:41.733
Uh...

10:41.767 --> 10:43.301
What about you?

10:43.335 --> 10:44.936
Manchester originally,
but I, uh,

10:44.970 --> 10:46.705
moved down here in my gap year.

10:46.738 --> 10:49.408
Uh, I had an internship
at an atelier in savile row.

10:49.441 --> 10:52.944
Oh, wow. I've just been in
redruth making my own clothes.

10:52.978 --> 10:55.414
I had a hunch you made that.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.549
Yeah, this is bouchra jarrar.

10:57.582 --> 11:00.318
Before she sold out
and moved to lanvin, obviously.

11:00.352 --> 11:01.920
- Smoke?
- No.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.555
Is it allowed in here?

11:03.588 --> 11:06.391
Oh, I-I just took
the batteries out of the alarm.

11:06.425 --> 11:09.828
I can go outside if you really
have a problem with it.

11:09.861 --> 11:11.329
No.

11:11.363 --> 11:12.831
- No, it's fine.
- I tried vaping.

11:12.864 --> 11:16.601
I just think it makes you look
like so much more of a cunt.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.737
Yeah, totally.

11:20.839 --> 11:22.708
So, what does your dad do?

11:22.741 --> 11:24.342
Uh, I don't know him.

11:24.376 --> 11:26.311
Oh, tell me about it.

11:26.344 --> 11:28.313
- And your mum?
- My mother's dead.

11:28.346 --> 11:31.850
Well, I knew we'd find
some common ground eventually.

11:31.883 --> 11:34.986
Yeah, I was only 15
when she died.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.621
What about you?

11:36.655 --> 11:37.956
Seven.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.458
Oh, wow, that is young.

11:39.491 --> 11:42.294
Although I guess
it's maybe easier at that age.

11:43.762 --> 11:46.732
Not that it's a competition,
though, is it?

11:49.668 --> 11:52.237
Ooh, fresh blood!

11:57.776 --> 12:00.746
Oh, my god, wow, is that
a bloody bouchra jarrar?

12:00.779 --> 12:02.547
Oh, good eye.

12:02.581 --> 12:04.792
Yeah, well, before she sold out
and moved to lanvin, obviously.

12:04.816 --> 12:06.017
- Yeah.
- Obviously.

12:06.052 --> 12:07.018
Oh.

12:07.053 --> 12:09.387
Oh, this is my roomie, Eloise.

12:09.421 --> 12:10.722
Hi.

12:10.756 --> 12:13.492
Yeah, she literally made
the outfit she's wearing.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.495
How amazing. All of us
turn up in our Sunday best,

12:16.528 --> 12:18.497
and she's here
rocking her own design.

12:19.631 --> 12:21.509
I'm thinking we should call her
brass balls Ellie.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.001
And what will we call you?

12:23.035 --> 12:24.636
Oh, well, by tomorrow morning,

12:24.669 --> 12:26.638
you'll know me only
as hurricane jocasta.

12:26.671 --> 12:29.007
Ooh. So you guys know
each other from before?

12:29.041 --> 12:30.542
Oh, yeah, we go way back.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.078
What is it, like 15 minutes?

12:32.111 --> 12:33.945
Yeah, something like that.

12:33.979 --> 12:36.048
We're in the dead mums club.

12:36.082 --> 12:38.050
- Oh.
- Fuck leukemia, am I right?

12:38.084 --> 12:40.485
- That's awful.
- Yeah.

12:40.519 --> 12:41.920
It's pretty shit.
I'm not gonna lie.

12:41.953 --> 12:44.923
But, I don't know, I feel like
it kind of fuels my work.

12:44.956 --> 12:45.991
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

12:46.024 --> 12:48.060
What happened to your mum?

12:48.094 --> 12:51.797
Uh, she wasn't well... mentally.

12:53.832 --> 12:56.535
She... she killed herself.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.703
Sorry.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.006
We shouldn't have asked.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.607
It was a long time ago.

13:02.641 --> 13:05.544
- You're, like, so brave.
- So brave.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.346
Yeah, I had a-a great-uncle
commit suicide... hung himself.

13:08.380 --> 13:09.581
Oh, god.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.583
So, yeah, I know exactly
what it's like.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.485
Also so brave.

13:13.518 --> 13:15.020
- So brave also.
- Yeah.

13:15.054 --> 13:16.454
Mm.

13:19.491 --> 13:21.459
First rodeo, Ellie?

13:23.528 --> 13:25.864
Got to Mark
your territory, babes.

13:27.099 --> 13:29.501
- Ooh.
- Oh.

13:29.534 --> 13:31.903
Time to break out the big guns.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.772
Let's really get on this bitch.

13:33.805 --> 13:36.575
Do we really want to be
hungover on our first day?

13:36.608 --> 13:38.710
Oh, hush.
That's future you talking.

13:38.743 --> 13:40.645
You know what, fuck her.

13:40.679 --> 13:42.981
You've got to live
in the now, girls.

13:43.014 --> 13:45.717
So, hos...

13:45.750 --> 13:47.153
To soho.

13:47.186 --> 13:49.055
To soho.

13:49.088 --> 13:51.123
To soho.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.926
Come on, Ellie. Keep up.

13:57.629 --> 14:00.498
You're gonna love it!

14:04.070 --> 14:06.371
Let's go!

14:07.572 --> 14:09.941
I dated an Irish guy twice.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.777
Well, like, the-the same guy
but, like, two separate times.

14:12.811 --> 14:15.013
- Oh.
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:15.047 --> 14:16.481
And, yeah, he was Irish.

14:16.514 --> 14:18.516
Yeah, and, I don't know,
I kind of feel like

14:18.550 --> 14:20.018
I kind of get the culture.

14:20.052 --> 14:21.419
Watch and learn, guys.

14:21.453 --> 14:22.687
And I just love Ireland.

14:22.721 --> 14:24.123
Like, he literally
introduced me...

14:24.156 --> 14:25.557
Um, excuse me, miss.

14:25.590 --> 14:27.626
Um, my dick just died.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.561
Can I Bury it in your arse?

14:29.594 --> 14:31.529
- Ew, absolutely not.
- Get away.

14:31.563 --> 14:32.898
That's disgusting.

14:32.931 --> 14:35.000
Oh, you should try
that line on Eloise.

14:35.034 --> 14:36.468
I bet she's complete filth

14:36.501 --> 14:38.204
once you get a few drinks
inside her.

14:38.237 --> 14:39.671
Okay. Okay.

14:39.704 --> 14:40.906
What?

14:40.939 --> 14:42.908
- Oh, come on, play the game.
- Aw. - Ellie.

15:02.228 --> 15:05.931
Freshers...
They're a blessing and a curse.

15:14.940 --> 15:17.209
It's just a bit shit.
I'm just like...

15:17.243 --> 15:19.644
She's such a code beige,
I'm getting these, like,

15:19.678 --> 15:22.048
born-again Christian vibes
off her.

15:22.081 --> 15:23.615
Who, country mouse?

15:23.648 --> 15:25.217
She comes to
her first day at lcf

15:25.251 --> 15:26.818
wearing clothes
she fucking made.

15:26.851 --> 15:28.653
Yeah, that was a bit much.

15:28.687 --> 15:29.964
Bringing up
her mum's suicide... I'm sorry,

15:29.988 --> 15:31.766
but, like, who the fuck
does that for attention?

15:31.790 --> 15:33.101
- Yeah, right.
- She's a bit weird.

15:33.125 --> 15:33.959
She's a lot fucking weird.

15:33.992 --> 15:35.227
I'd lay bets on her

15:35.261 --> 15:36.701
slashing her wrists
before Christmas.

15:37.729 --> 15:38.897
You can't say that.

15:38.930 --> 15:40.699
- It's true.
- Jocasta!

15:40.732 --> 15:42.277
Come on. We've got

Didn't you put on that techno
<i>riverdance</i> shit at the toucan?

17:43.721 --> 17:45.957
All yours.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.961
Don't pay any attention to him.

17:49.994 --> 17:53.165
- I'm John, by the way.
- Ellie.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.367
Oh, shit.

17:55.401 --> 17:58.104
Uh, this is your can, isn't it?

17:58.137 --> 17:59.138
Have it.

18:19.425 --> 18:21.160
No, no, no, no!

18:36.475 --> 18:38.877
- Yasmine Rogers?
- Here.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.148
- Gemma boker?
- Here.

18:42.181 --> 18:43.915
Poppy Porter?

18:43.948 --> 18:45.117
Here.

18:46.085 --> 18:47.453
Eloise Turner?

18:47.486 --> 18:49.288
It's Ellie.

18:49.321 --> 18:51.756
Uh, sorry.
What was the question?

18:51.789 --> 18:53.658
Are you present?

18:54.426 --> 18:55.827
Yeah.

18:55.860 --> 18:58.430
- Serena lowe?
- Here.

18:58.464 --> 19:00.332
Jack sharp?

19:00.366 --> 19:03.902
So, how's
my big-time fashion designer?

19:03.935 --> 19:05.437
I'm good. I'm good.

19:05.471 --> 19:07.872
And did you wow them all?

19:07.906 --> 19:10.775
- I don't know, gran.
- I bet you did.

19:10.808 --> 19:12.378
Anyway, you still
haven't told me

19:12.411 --> 19:14.180
anything about your place.

19:14.213 --> 19:15.780
It's great.

19:15.813 --> 19:17.316
Very modern.

19:17.349 --> 19:18.950
And how's your roommate?

19:18.983 --> 19:21.120
- Jocasta.
- Is she nice?

19:21.153 --> 19:23.922
- Yeah, yeah, she's fun.
- How lovely.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.757
I say pub crawl, round two.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.059
Almost too much fun.

19:27.092 --> 19:28.494
Well, that's wonderful.

19:28.527 --> 19:30.728
I-I thought maybe
you'd need more time

19:30.762 --> 19:33.731
to get used to being around
so many people.

19:33.765 --> 19:35.800
It's not all too much, is it?

19:35.833 --> 19:37.369
No, I'm okay.

19:37.403 --> 19:39.737
I can't wait to come down
and see you.

19:39.771 --> 19:41.806
- When you feel more at home.
- Yeah.

19:41.839 --> 19:44.043
When I feel more at home.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.215
<i>Soho 0827.</i>

19:49.248 --> 19:51.950
<i>Hi. I saw your advert
for a room to rent.</i>

19:51.983 --> 19:53.485
<i>Yes?</i>

19:53.519 --> 19:55.421
<i>Uh, I'd like to rent it.</i>

19:55.454 --> 19:56.988
<i>Do you know goodge street?</i>

19:57.021 --> 19:59.091
<i>Uh, no, but I can find it.</i>

19:59.124 --> 20:01.493
<i>Well, it's 8 goodge place.</i>

20:01.527 --> 20:04.396
<i>Press the buzzer for Collins.</i>

20:06.498 --> 20:08.967
Just coming, deary.

20:10.868 --> 20:12.837
- Ms. Collins?
- Yes.

20:12.870 --> 20:15.006
It's Ellie.
We spoke on the phone.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.741
Oh, yes.

20:17.476 --> 20:20.212
Room is on the top floor.

20:20.246 --> 20:22.248
I've a few rules.

20:22.281 --> 20:24.049
Don't take smokers.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.251
I don't smoke.

20:25.284 --> 20:28.420
No male visitors after 8:00.

20:28.454 --> 20:30.021
Not a problem.

20:30.055 --> 20:32.824
And no using
the laundry room at night.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.926
It rattles
right through to mine.

20:34.959 --> 20:36.828
- I don't do laundry.
- Eh?

20:36.861 --> 20:40.032
I mean...
I don't do nighttime laundry.

20:40.065 --> 20:41.533
I do do laundry. I'm very clean.

20:41.567 --> 20:42.834
Good.

20:45.471 --> 20:47.506
It's a bit old-fashioned
for some,

20:47.539 --> 20:49.341
but I won't do nothing to it.

20:49.375 --> 20:52.177
If you don't like it,
you can find somewhere else.

20:52.211 --> 20:53.545
It's perfect.

20:53.579 --> 20:55.214
I love it.

20:55.247 --> 20:58.150
Bed, kitchenette, bathroom.

20:58.183 --> 21:00.586
You won't have to worry
about it until the summer,

21:00.619 --> 21:03.322
but then you'll have to
keep the plugs in

21:03.355 --> 21:05.823
'cause all the smells rise up.

21:05.857 --> 21:07.426
How long have you lived here?

21:07.459 --> 21:10.062
Oh, a long while.

21:10.095 --> 21:13.465
I used to work here,
cleaning and such,

21:13.499 --> 21:16.834
back when round here
was a bad spot.

21:16.868 --> 21:19.305
I bought it for buttons
off the old owner.

21:19.338 --> 21:21.040
Must be worth a lot now.

21:21.073 --> 21:22.907
Oh, I could never sell it.

21:22.940 --> 21:24.942
Too many memories.

21:25.577 --> 21:27.413
Yeah.

21:30.082 --> 21:32.084
If I could live any place
and any time,

21:32.117 --> 21:34.852
I'd live here in London
in the '60s.

21:34.886 --> 21:37.523
It must have felt like
the center of the universe.

21:37.556 --> 21:39.891
I hope you know
what a landline is.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.593
Some of your lot don't.

21:41.627 --> 21:43.961
- Course.
- Don't get too excited.

21:43.995 --> 21:46.065
It only makes emergency calls.

21:46.098 --> 21:48.467
Oh, and I hope you like garlic.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.135
Yeah.

21:50.169 --> 21:52.937
There's a French bistro
next door.

21:52.970 --> 21:57.042
Pretty soon, you won't be able
to smell anything else.

22:01.647 --> 22:04.383
<i>So, when you looking to move in?</i>

22:04.416 --> 22:07.119
As soon as possible.

22:07.152 --> 22:08.620
You're not in any trouble,
are you?

22:08.654 --> 22:10.021
No.

22:10.055 --> 22:12.591
No, I just need, uh, an escape.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.959
Oh, don't we all, deary.

22:14.992 --> 22:17.062
What's your line of work?

22:17.096 --> 22:19.398
I'm a student, but I have
a loan and a bursary.

22:19.431 --> 22:21.400
Well, what do you study?

22:21.433 --> 22:22.634
Fashion.

22:22.668 --> 22:24.370
Ah. Interesting.

22:24.403 --> 22:26.271
Yeah. My gran's a seamstress,

22:26.305 --> 22:28.973
and my mum is...
Was in the industry, too.

22:29.006 --> 22:31.043
And you're sure you'll be able
to make the rent?

22:31.076 --> 22:33.412
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'll make it work.

22:33.445 --> 22:35.913
I do ask more
than your average landlady.

22:35.947 --> 22:37.649
I want two months rent
in advance

22:37.683 --> 22:39.651
and two months deposit.

22:39.685 --> 22:41.520
- Okay.
- I've had people

22:41.553 --> 22:44.256
just take off in the middle
of the night. That's why.

22:44.289 --> 22:46.158
Ms. Collins...

22:47.159 --> 22:49.428
I would never do that.

Hello.
You're a gorgeous creature.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.775
- What's your name?
- Sandie.

26:56.808 --> 26:58.410
Care to join
my friends and I, sandie?

26:58.443 --> 27:00.912
Thanks, but I'm here
to meet the owner.

27:00.946 --> 27:02.648
I am the owner.

27:02.681 --> 27:06.218
Oh, I doubt that.

27:06.251 --> 27:08.720
I'm whatever
you want me to be, sandie.

27:21.733 --> 27:22.934
What's your poison, miss?

27:22.968 --> 27:25.203
I'm not here to drink, actually.

27:25.237 --> 27:26.705
I want to speak to the owner.

27:26.738 --> 27:27.939
Owner's not in tonight.

27:27.973 --> 27:29.517
What do you want
to speak to them about?

27:29.541 --> 27:31.877
I want to be
your new headline act.

27:31.910 --> 27:34.212
- Where have you played before?
- Nowhere.

27:34.246 --> 27:36.615
Who starts at the cafe de Paris?

27:36.648 --> 27:38.550
Me.

27:39.551 --> 27:41.520
I can take your name
if you want,

27:41.553 --> 27:43.689
but maybe you should speak
to Jack in the meantime.

27:43.722 --> 27:45.557
Jack?

27:45.590 --> 27:46.391
Over there.

27:46.425 --> 27:48.694
The guy standing
next to cilla black.

27:48.727 --> 27:51.229
Brilliant, cilla.
Honestly, what a performance.

27:51.263 --> 27:52.698
He manages a lot of girls.

28:11.016 --> 28:13.518
Well, hello there.

28:14.619 --> 28:16.588
The bartender said
I should get to know

28:16.621 --> 28:18.824
the handsome fella
standing next to cilla black.

28:18.857 --> 28:20.025
You should.

28:20.059 --> 28:21.660
And you are?

28:21.693 --> 28:24.429
The next cilla black.

28:26.364 --> 28:28.400
Are you, now?

28:28.433 --> 28:31.369
Well, you know, she started out
as a coat check girl.

28:31.403 --> 28:33.472
You willing to work your way up?

28:33.505 --> 28:34.873
Of course.

28:34.906 --> 28:36.875
What can I get you to drink?

28:36.908 --> 28:39.344
It's sandie,
and I'd love a vesper.

28:39.377 --> 28:40.946
James, we'd love a vesper.

28:45.051 --> 28:47.652
So, what do you do, sandie?

28:47.686 --> 28:49.855
Well, I sing, of course.

28:49.888 --> 28:51.757
How's your dancing?

28:51.790 --> 28:54.259
Care for a demonstration?

28:59.331 --> 29:00.766
Here we go.

30:09.467 --> 30:11.636
Your thoughts?

30:11.670 --> 30:13.839
You're already a star.

30:13.872 --> 30:17.542
But you could be an old lady
before you get onstage here.

30:17.576 --> 30:19.611
How about I get you a gig
somewhere this week?

30:19.644 --> 30:21.613
- You could do that?
- I could, indeed.

30:21.646 --> 30:23.882
But first,
let me get your vesper.

30:28.154 --> 30:30.388
- Do I get a dance now?
- Afraid not.

30:30.422 --> 30:32.023
Oh, you looked up for it
just then.

30:32.058 --> 30:34.526
I'm just waiting for my friend
Jack to get my drink.

30:34.559 --> 30:37.596
- Well, I'm sure Jack won't mind.
- I mind.

30:37.629 --> 30:39.965
Now, don't pretend
you don't love the attention.

30:39.998 --> 30:41.566
Is this man bothering you?

30:41.600 --> 30:43.444
I was just asking
our friend sandie for a dance.

30:43.468 --> 30:44.636
Her card is full right now.

30:44.669 --> 30:45.971
That's all right, old chap.

30:46.004 --> 30:47.739
Don't hog her all night.

30:47.772 --> 30:49.908
You're the only hog
round here, old chap.

30:49.941 --> 30:51.576
Now, don't be a cunt about it.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.879
You can keep your little whore.

30:53.912 --> 30:55.881
What did you call the lady?

30:55.914 --> 30:58.750
She's a slut, mate. Look at her.

31:03.622 --> 31:05.790
Come on.

31:50.769 --> 31:53.072

is drive you home.

So, you imagine the wearer
when you're designing?

41:29.448 --> 41:33.519
When I see someone in it,
when-when I imagine it,

41:33.552 --> 41:35.254
sh-she's wearing the dress.

41:35.287 --> 41:37.289
The dress isn't wearing her.

41:37.322 --> 41:39.791
I hope you were all
listening to that.

41:39.825 --> 41:42.261
Something about the '60s?

41:42.294 --> 41:43.762
It's excellent, Ellie.

41:43.795 --> 41:46.131
- And I like your hair.
- Thanks.

41:49.568 --> 41:51.603
Wow.

41:52.571 --> 41:55.507
Yeah, it really suits you.

41:55.541 --> 41:56.808
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

41:56.842 --> 41:59.111
Everything was
so well made back then.

41:59.144 --> 42:02.147
We have a biba dress
in the back.

42:02.180 --> 42:04.783
1967, immaculate condition.

42:04.816 --> 42:06.485
You should try that one, too.

You'd think I'd have more sense

than to take a racing tip
from that fella

43:06.612 --> 43:09.147
after all these years, wouldn't you?

43:09.781 --> 43:11.550
What can I get you, love?

43:11.583 --> 43:13.719
Well, I was hoping a job.

43:14.686 --> 43:16.588
Take a seat. You want a drink?

43:16.622 --> 43:18.223
Uh, yeah.

43:18.256 --> 43:19.625

43:19.658 --> 43:21.326
This isn't Mayfair, darling.

43:21.360 --> 43:23.562
Have you ever even worked
in a pub before?

43:23.595 --> 43:25.163
No.

43:25.197 --> 43:26.698
But we all have to
start somewhere.

43:26.732 --> 43:29.735
I'll get you a g and t so.

43:45.951 --> 43:49.254
So, what shifts can you do?

43:49.287 --> 43:51.390

43:54.559 --> 43:55.961
Excuse me.

Excuse me, love.

43:58.897 --> 44:00.666
I'm talking to you, blondie.

44:00.699 --> 44:02.467
Sorry, I have to be somewhere.

44:02.501 --> 44:04.836
I'm not trying to pick you up,
sweetheart. Don't worry.

44:04.870 --> 44:06.972
I'm not worried.

44:07.005 --> 44:08.674
You look familiar to me.

44:08.707 --> 44:10.275
Who's your mother?

44:10.308 --> 44:11.877
My mother's dead.

44:11.910 --> 44:14.880
I thought she might be.

44:14.913 --> 44:17.182
Most of 'em are.

44:22.587 --> 44:23.822
Get out of the fucking road!

44:23.855 --> 44:25.891
Watch where you're going, girl.

44:25.924 --> 44:28.694
Jesus Christ.

44:33.565 --> 44:35.467
Can I help you?

44:36.334 --> 44:37.669
It's me, Ellie.

44:38.870 --> 44:40.872
So it is.

44:40.906 --> 44:42.441
Look at that.

44:42.474 --> 44:45.310
- You've changed your hair.
- Yeah.

44:45.343 --> 44:46.945
I wanted to go
for something different...

44:46.978 --> 44:48.580
You know, a bit '60s.

44:48.613 --> 44:51.316
You play a lot
of that music, don't you?

44:51.349 --> 44:52.584
Is it too loud?

44:52.617 --> 44:54.853
Not at all,
but what's that about?

44:54.886 --> 44:57.389
It's more my time than yours.

44:57.422 --> 44:58.990
My gran plays it a lot.

44:59.024 --> 45:01.760
Guess I just like the old songs
better than the stuff today.

48:29.101 --> 48:32.737
- All right, Jack?
- Enjoy yourself.

48:32.771 --> 48:34.739
Colin.

48:34.773 --> 48:37.876
- Mr. Pointer.
- Well, well, well.

48:37.909 --> 48:40.046
Please.

48:42.614 --> 48:46.618
We were promised a great show,
and show you did.

48:47.519 --> 48:49.255
Show you did.

48:49.288 --> 48:50.588
Thank you.

48:50.622 --> 48:53.125
Maybe we could, uh...

48:53.159 --> 48:55.827
Go for some drinks, sandie, eh?

48:55.860 --> 48:56.962
Just us.

48:58.230 --> 49:00.099
I'm with Jack.

49:00.132 --> 49:02.734
Oh, Jack doesn't mind.
Do you, Jack?

49:05.804 --> 49:07.706
Not one bit.

49:10.276 --> 49:11.509
Sandie.

49:11.543 --> 49:12.610
Sorry, sir.

49:12.644 --> 49:15.081
Sandie, get back here. Sandie.

49:15.114 --> 49:17.716
- Jack, I don't want to do this.
- You told me you were serious

49:17.749 --> 49:19.827
about being a performer, so if
you want to keep doing it,

49:19.851 --> 49:21.996
then these are the kind of men
that you need to keep happy.

49:22.020 --> 49:24.589
- The men you really need to perform for.
- No, Jack.

49:24.622 --> 49:27.559
Everybody else is doing it.
What makes you so special?

49:28.160 --> 49:30.628
- Oi!
- She said no!

49:31.629 --> 49:33.865
We all have to start somewhere.

49:33.898 --> 49:37.802
Sandie, don't be a damn fool!

49:40.306 --> 49:42.674
Sandie!

49:45.577 --> 49:47.779
Listen, love, come here!

49:47.812 --> 49:50.682
No, it's not what I thought.

49:50.715 --> 49:53.952
Sandie,
this is the way it works.

49:54.953 --> 49:58.023
I'd do what
your manager tells you.

49:59.824 --> 50:02.660
Don't want to make me
unhappy, do you?

50:02.694 --> 50:04.829
- Eh?
- Wake up.

50:04.863 --> 50:07.099
You were the one
who wanted this!

50:07.133 --> 50:09.934
More than anything, you said.

50:11.669 --> 50:14.340
You know this is all an act.

50:14.373 --> 50:17.709
You know where
this is heading, sandie.

50:17.742 --> 50:20.312
Where are you gonna run to, eh?

50:20.346 --> 50:22.547
Home?

50:53.945 --> 50:55.814
<i>This is just a taste</i>

50:55.847 --> 50:58.217
<i>of things to come, sandie.</i>

51:14.066 --> 51:16.368
Coo-ee.

51:16.402 --> 51:19.003
I know you're not asleep.

51:19.038 --> 51:21.107
Leave her alone!

51:32.750 --> 51:34.752
You know you're not asleep.

51:55.374 --> 51:57.909
<i>You were the one
who wanted this!</i>

51:59.744 --> 52:01.713
<i>More than anything, you said.</i>

52:01.746 --> 52:03.781
<i>What makes you so special?</i>

52:03.815 --> 52:05.917
<i>What makes you so special?</i>

52:05.950 --> 52:07.819
<i>What makes you so special?</i>

52:10.322 --> 52:12.424
- Ellie.
- Oh, my god.

52:12.458 --> 52:14.326
Ellie.
Hey, what-what are you doing?

52:14.360 --> 52:16.462
- What are you doing?
- Starting again.

52:16.495 --> 52:19.864
Listen. This is a wobble, okay?

52:20.732 --> 52:22.134
It's just a crisis
of confidence,

52:22.168 --> 52:25.037
and I see it all the time.

52:25.070 --> 52:29.041
But you are really
onto something here,

52:29.074 --> 52:30.909
so don't stop now.

52:30.942 --> 52:32.111
Okay?

52:45.090 --> 52:47.926
Tuned to the moon?

52:47.959 --> 52:49.994
Customer.

52:56.768 --> 52:58.270
- Hi.
- Hey.

52:58.304 --> 52:59.737
What do you want?

52:59.771 --> 53:02.508
Well, I heard you work here now,

53:02.541 --> 53:04.943
and I was going for a drink,
so I thought,

53:04.976 --> 53:06.844
kill two birds with one stone.

53:06.878 --> 53:10.782
Just because you seemed
a little upset in class today.

53:10.815 --> 53:13.519
And I thought maybe
I could swing by,

53:13.552 --> 53:15.387
see how you were getting on.

53:15.421 --> 53:17.456
Thanks.

53:17.489 --> 53:19.757
I meant,
what do you want to drink?

53:19.791 --> 53:21.493
Oh, yeah.

53:21.527 --> 53:24.129
- Three kronenbourgs, please.
- Sure.

53:25.930 --> 53:27.366
Heard you got a new place.

53:27.399 --> 53:29.535
Yeah. I'm in a bedsit.

53:29.568 --> 53:31.803
That's good, right?

53:31.836 --> 53:33.505
It's really something else.

53:33.539 --> 53:36.874
It must be great
living on your own.

53:37.509 --> 53:39.144
Must be.

53:39.178 --> 53:41.480
Why? What's up?

53:41.513 --> 53:43.148
Nothing.

53:43.182 --> 53:45.451
I'm just a bit overwhelmed
at the moment.

53:45.484 --> 53:47.319
London can be a lot.

53:50.021 --> 53:51.257
I get it.

53:51.290 --> 53:54.493
Coming to the city can be
a bit of a nightmare.

53:54.526 --> 53:56.528
Honestly, I'd be lying if I said

53:56.562 --> 53:59.365
I had the best time
in north London so far.

53:59.398 --> 54:01.333
Where'd you move from?

54:01.367 --> 54:03.168
South London.

54:04.836 --> 54:06.838
I'm gonna get these to my mates.

54:08.540 --> 54:10.209
But...

54:11.343 --> 54:14.912
I know what it's like
to feel like you don't belong.

54:16.014 --> 54:19.951
And I'm a good listener,
if you ever want to talk.

54:26.458 --> 54:29.861
They're meant to talk to you
about their problems,

54:29.894 --> 54:32.930
- not the other way round.
- Mm.

54:42.341 --> 54:45.144
So, how is everything?

54:45.177 --> 54:47.046
You never tell me
anything anymore.

54:47.079 --> 54:49.114
Everything's great, gran.

54:49.148 --> 54:50.616
Goodbye, beautiful.

54:50.649 --> 54:52.318
I'll see you tomorrow.

54:52.351 --> 54:53.619
Who was that?

54:53.652 --> 54:55.087
Uh, no one.

54:55.120 --> 54:57.323
Look, we're at the pub,

54:57.356 --> 54:59.191
a whole bunch of us, having fun.

54:59.224 --> 55:00.459
We?

55:00.492 --> 55:02.061
Yeah, hurricane jocasta.

55:02.094 --> 55:04.029
Everyone, really.
The whole class.

55:04.063 --> 55:06.498
- Something's wrong.
- No.

55:06.532 --> 55:10.035
Ellie, I can hear it
in your voice.

55:10.069 --> 55:12.870
Gran, I really am at the pub.

55:12.904 --> 55:14.573
I'm working here.

55:14.606 --> 55:17.509
Working there? Why?

55:17.543 --> 55:20.145
- I moved out the halls.
- Oh, no. What...

55:20.179 --> 55:22.081
I needed to get
a place of my own.

55:22.114 --> 55:23.881
Did-did something happen?

55:23.915 --> 55:25.917
- Did you see her again?
- No.

55:25.950 --> 55:28.320
No, mum's not here with me.

55:28.354 --> 55:30.322
Then what is it?

55:30.356 --> 55:32.191
What's wrong?

55:32.224 --> 55:33.392
Please tell me.

55:33.425 --> 55:35.026
Look, I should go back in.

55:35.060 --> 55:37.029
I know you think you have
something to prove,

55:37.062 --> 55:40.265
but it's okay to ask for help.

55:40.299 --> 55:42.468
She didn't.

55:42.501 --> 55:45.104
Gran, I have to go.

55:45.137 --> 55:48.140
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

55:48.173 --> 55:51.110
Everything all right, Ellie?

55:51.143 --> 55:53.379
Or do I call you Eloise,

55:53.412 --> 55:56.048
like the old song?

55:56.081 --> 55:58.117
I don't know that song.

55:58.150 --> 55:59.651
And how do you know my name?

55:59.685 --> 56:01.919
I make it my business to know

56:01.953 --> 56:04.323
all the pretty girls
around here.

56:04.356 --> 56:06.625
All their problems.

56:06.658 --> 56:08.427
Always have done.

56:09.428 --> 56:11.163
You smoke, don't you, love?

56:11.196 --> 56:12.131
No.

56:12.164 --> 56:16.235
Oh, must be thinking
of some other blonde.

56:17.336 --> 56:19.438
Anyway...

56:21.206 --> 56:22.974
Be well.

56:30.716 --> 56:33.285
Was handsy bothering you?

56:33.318 --> 56:34.686
Handsy?

56:34.720 --> 56:36.388
Yeah.

56:36.422 --> 56:38.022
The man's like an octopus.

56:38.056 --> 56:40.192
Carol says he was a right
ladies' man back in the day.

56:40.225 --> 56:43.328
Probably thinks
he has a shot with you.

56:46.231 --> 56:48.200
<i>Do you believe in spirits?</i>

56:48.233 --> 56:51.036
What kind of a question is that?

56:51.069 --> 56:53.338
That brown stuff
pays your wages.

56:54.406 --> 56:56.575
I mean...

56:56.608 --> 56:58.744
Do you believe in ghosts?

56:58.777 --> 57:01.480
Ghosts? No.

57:01.513 --> 57:03.282
Why?

57:04.483 --> 57:06.318
Are you scared down here?

57:06.351 --> 57:09.721
If this place is haunted by
anything, it's the good times.

57:09.755 --> 57:14.526
When it's empty,
all I hear is the laughs.

57:14.560 --> 57:17.229
Every gangster, every copper,

57:17.262 --> 57:19.398
every red-faced lush
has been in here,

57:19.431 --> 57:24.036
and all those high spirits
have soaked into the walls.

57:24.069 --> 57:26.371
You could probably
get drunk on just that.

57:27.773 --> 57:30.042
Yeah.

57:34.246 --> 57:37.014
Ellie, I love you, girl.

57:37.049 --> 57:39.218
You fit right in.

57:39.251 --> 57:42.321
But you can't sleep here.

58:25.697 --> 58:27.466
Come on,
they're waiting for you!

58:28.300 --> 58:30.402

58:30.435 --> 58:32.771

Will that be enough?

01:04:59.557 --> 01:05:01.893
Well, I was gonna slap
a bit of this on.

01:11:29.648 --> 01:11:31.083
Ellie, what's wrong?

01:11:31.116 --> 01:11:32.917
Who'd have you now, eh?

01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:35.953
Eloise!
What is going on in there?

01:11:35.987 --> 01:11:38.190
No male visitors!

01:11:38.223 --> 01:11:39.625
Who's in there?!

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.462
I'll call the police!

01:11:43.495 --> 01:11:44.962
Fuck.

01:11:44.996 --> 01:11:46.532
Get him out of here!

01:11:46.565 --> 01:11:50.035
Where are you gonna go, eh?

01:11:50.968 --> 01:11:52.604
Where you going?
Where you going?

01:11:52.638 --> 01:11:55.040
Fuck.

01:12:01.547 --> 01:12:04.849
Get out! Get out!

01:12:09.555 --> 01:12:10.622
Get out!

01:12:15.361 --> 01:12:18.330
Get out!

01:12:18.364 --> 01:12:20.632
<i>You know where to find me.</i>

01:12:20.666 --> 01:12:22.468
<i>You know where to find me.</i>

01:12:22.501 --> 01:12:24.370
<i>You know where to find me.</i>

01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:51.896
Are you okay?

01:12:53.399 --> 01:12:55.267
Yeah.

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:57.202
Did he hurt you?

01:12:58.303 --> 01:13:00.305
- No.
- You sure?

01:13:01.306 --> 01:13:03.075
He didn't hurt me.

01:13:05.009 --> 01:13:08.080
We'll talk about this
in the morning.

01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:40.179
Sorry.

01:13:40.779 --> 01:13:42.314
For everything.

01:13:42.347 --> 01:13:43.715
It won't happen again, will it?

01:13:43.749 --> 01:13:45.317
No.

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:48.654
I-I'll-I'll pay
for the mirror, too.

01:13:48.687 --> 01:13:51.323
We all pay
for a broken mirror, deary.

01:13:51.356 --> 01:13:52.491
Ms. Collins.

01:13:54.025 --> 01:13:56.728
Did a girl live upstairs before?

01:13:56.762 --> 01:13:59.698
Lots of girls have lived here
over the years.

01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:02.234
Someone called sandie?

01:14:03.268 --> 01:14:05.237
Lots of girls have lived here
over the years,

01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:07.539
and not all of them
with their real names.

01:14:07.573 --> 01:14:09.006
Why do you ask?

01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:11.410
Did someone die in my room?

01:14:12.544 --> 01:14:14.213
This is London.

01:14:14.246 --> 01:14:16.315
Someone's died in every room

01:14:16.348 --> 01:14:19.051
in every building
in this whole city.

01:14:19.084 --> 01:14:21.487
Every street corner, too.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.589
Oh, and speaking of which,
I would have killed

01:14:23.622 --> 01:14:26.758
your gentleman friend
last night if I'd caught him,

01:14:26.792 --> 01:14:30.229
so count yourself lucky,
broken mirror or not.

01:14:42.674 --> 01:14:45.410
Where you going?

01:14:47.446 --> 01:14:49.147
Where you going?

01:14:49.748 --> 01:14:51.683
Where you going?

01:14:51.717 --> 01:14:54.286
Where you going?
Where you going?

01:14:55.153 --> 01:14:57.189
Where you going?

01:14:57.789 --> 01:14:59.525
Where you going?

01:15:09.868 --> 01:15:12.204
Good morning, Ellie.

01:15:18.343 --> 01:15:22.180

01:17:19.398 --> 01:17:21.266
<i>These are the kind of men</i>

01:17:21.299 --> 01:17:23.435

01:17:23.468 --> 01:17:25.470

<i>Don't you ever disrespect me!</i>

01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:29.941
<i>I'm talking to you, blondie.</i>

01:17:29.975 --> 01:17:31.543
<i>This is London.</i>

01:17:31.576 --> 01:17:33.345
<i>You look familiar to me.</i>

01:17:33.378 --> 01:17:35.647
<i>Did he hurt you?</i>

01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:41.253
Just so I've got this straight,

01:17:41.286 --> 01:17:43.655
you-you witnessed
the murder last night,

01:17:43.689 --> 01:17:47.559
but you believe this was
a vision from the past,

01:17:47.592 --> 01:17:52.464
the murder of a young woman
in the mid to late 1960s

01:17:52.497 --> 01:17:55.767
by a man you believe
to be her pimp.

01:17:56.802 --> 01:17:57.936
Yeah.

01:17:57.969 --> 01:17:59.905
You're an art student, correct?

01:17:59.938 --> 01:18:01.506
Uh, fashion.

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:04.242
Have you ever taken
any hallucinogens?

01:18:04.276 --> 01:18:06.244
Acid, mushrooms, mescaline?

01:18:06.278 --> 01:18:08.313
We're not gonna get you
into trouble if you have.

01:18:08.346 --> 01:18:10.949
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm not on drugs.

01:18:10.982 --> 01:18:12.451
I don't take anything.

01:18:12.484 --> 01:18:14.419
You were at a party before.

01:18:14.453 --> 01:18:15.997
Could somebody have
slipped you something?

01:18:16.021 --> 01:18:18.390
Maybe somebody
bought you a drink?

01:18:18.423 --> 01:18:19.758
Get these down you.

01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:22.327
Uh, no.

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.330
No, it-it... it started
before last night.

01:18:25.363 --> 01:18:28.266
When I was sober,
I saw landmarks in my dreams,

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.368
details of nightclubs,

01:18:30.402 --> 01:18:31.813
<i>places that
I'd never been to before,</i>

01:18:31.837 --> 01:18:35.407
<i>and then I saw those details
in real life.</i>

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.911
I know something bad happened
to this girl,

01:18:39.945 --> 01:18:44.916
'cause I have these visions,
these visions of the past.

01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:48.487
Ever since I moved to London,
I keep seeing sandie.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.922
Th-that's the murdered girl.

01:18:50.956 --> 01:18:53.759
Have you only been here
a short time?

01:18:53.792 --> 01:18:55.427
A few weeks.

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:57.496
London, well, it can be a lot.

01:18:57.529 --> 01:18:59.898
Maybe it would help
if you spoke to someone.

01:18:59.931 --> 01:19:02.034
Look, please just listen to me!

01:19:02.068 --> 01:19:05.570
Is there a history
of s-schizophrenia

01:19:05.604 --> 01:19:08.540
or mental health issues
in your family?

01:19:11.443 --> 01:19:14.046
I know who the killer is.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:17.482
It's her boyfriend,
uh, and her pimp, Jack.

01:19:17.516 --> 01:19:19.551
I've seen him
in the present day.

01:19:20.552 --> 01:19:23.055
Look, there's this man
I've seen around soho

01:19:23.089 --> 01:19:24.456
<i>who follows me.</i>

01:19:24.489 --> 01:19:25.791
<i>The first time I saw him</i>

01:19:25.824 --> 01:19:27.692
<i>outside one of
those models places,</i>

01:19:27.726 --> 01:19:29.528
<i>he didn't take
much notice of me,</i>

01:19:29.561 --> 01:19:31.563
<i>but he did suddenly take notice</i>

01:19:31.596 --> 01:19:33.431
<i>when I changed my hair
to the same style</i>

01:19:33.465 --> 01:19:35.400
<i>as sandie's, the murdered girl.</i>

01:19:35.433 --> 01:19:37.836
What, this hairdo?

01:19:38.770 --> 01:19:41.773
Look... look, my point is
I've seen Jack.

01:19:41.807 --> 01:19:45.410
I've seen the killer
as an old man around soho.

01:19:45.443 --> 01:19:48.613
Can you narrow down
"around soho"?

01:19:49.447 --> 01:19:51.349
He drinks at the toucan.

01:19:51.383 --> 01:19:54.553
I think we've got all we need.

01:20:18.009 --> 01:20:19.845
And then she says the...

01:20:19.878 --> 01:20:21.789
The killer drinks at the toucan
and-and narrows it down

01:20:21.813 --> 01:20:23.815
to me, you
and the whole rest of soho.

01:20:25.151 --> 01:20:26.985
Yeah,
I'm sitting there thinking,

01:20:27.018 --> 01:20:29.621
"this is complete bullshit,
darling."

01:20:29.654 --> 01:20:30.956
Miss Turner.

01:20:30.989 --> 01:20:32.158
Miss Turner, don't go.

01:20:32.191 --> 01:20:33.792
I'd really like you
to stick around.

01:20:33.825 --> 01:20:36.128
What do I need to do
to convince you I'm not crazy?

01:20:36.162 --> 01:20:37.762
I don't think you are.

01:20:37.796 --> 01:20:39.107
I just think you need
a bit of help to settle in.

01:20:39.131 --> 01:20:41.100
A-A support system.

01:20:41.133 --> 01:20:42.534
You've done the right thing.

01:20:42.567 --> 01:20:44.002
Please hear that, okay?

01:20:44.036 --> 01:20:45.503
And I will look into
sandie's murder,

01:20:45.537 --> 01:20:47.039
and I've got
your contact details,

01:20:47.073 --> 01:20:49.374
so if anything comes up,
I'll be in touch.

01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:51.610
Thank you.

01:20:51.643 --> 01:20:53.411
Though I will say,
in such cases,

01:20:53.445 --> 01:20:55.547
especially this old,
it's hard when you don't have

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.149
something concrete to go on...

01:20:57.183 --> 01:20:59.651
Even a last name.

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:11.596
I want to look up murdered
women, uh, missing persons

01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:15.034
in the central London area
from 1960 to 1969.

01:21:15.067 --> 01:21:17.535
Aren't you a fashion student?

01:21:18.137 --> 01:21:20.472
Yeah. Yeah, it's research.

01:21:20.505 --> 01:21:22.507
You're doing some
cool fashion shoots

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.709
based on infamous murder sites
or something?

01:21:24.743 --> 01:21:25.610
Yeah.

01:21:25.644 --> 01:21:27.812
Yeah, that's exactly right.

01:21:27.846 --> 01:21:30.815
- Killer.
- It is.

01:21:48.267 --> 01:21:50.036
Hey, Ellie, I got your...

01:21:50.069 --> 01:21:51.937
Jesus, John!

01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:53.805
Why whisper like that?

01:21:53.838 --> 01:21:55.740
It's a library.

01:21:56.708 --> 01:21:58.210
Right.

01:21:58.244 --> 01:22:00.079
I have your stuff.

01:22:00.112 --> 01:22:01.713
You ran out.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:04.015
Uh, left your bag.

01:22:04.050 --> 01:22:06.085
Everyone's here,

01:22:06.118 --> 01:22:07.686
cramming for the test.

01:22:07.719 --> 01:22:10.822
Listen, about last night.

01:22:10.855 --> 01:22:13.225
I mean, if I did
something wrong...

01:22:13.259 --> 01:22:14.960
No, you didn't.

01:22:14.993 --> 01:22:16.528
Sorry, it's not about you.

01:22:16.561 --> 01:22:19.864
Then... what is it, El?

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:24.602
You'll think I sound crazy.

01:22:27.872 --> 01:22:29.507
Talk to me.

01:22:29.541 --> 01:22:32.677
Last night, I saw something.

01:22:32.711 --> 01:22:35.114
In the bedroom, from the past.

01:22:35.147 --> 01:22:36.915
What did you see?

01:22:39.617 --> 01:22:41.853
A girl was stabbed.

01:22:42.887 --> 01:22:44.923
There's a girl
that used to live in my room...

01:22:44.956 --> 01:22:46.524
<i>Sandie.</i>

01:22:46.558 --> 01:22:48.236
<i>The guy that killed her
is still out there.</i>

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:50.628
So I'm looking
for murdered women

01:22:50.662 --> 01:22:52.630
and missing persons
from the '60s

01:22:52.664 --> 01:22:55.034
to try and find out her name.

01:22:56.035 --> 01:22:58.636
And if I don't,
I'm gonna lose my mind.

01:22:58.670 --> 01:23:01.539
Maybe I already have.

01:23:02.174 --> 01:23:04.043
Feel free to run a mile now.

01:23:04.076 --> 01:23:06.312
Listen.

01:23:06.345 --> 01:23:11.716
My auntie believes in
all sorts of weird shit.

01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:15.587
So you just tell me
how I can help.

01:23:18.923 --> 01:23:21.960
Well, I guess you can start
with the next year of boxes:

01:23:21.993 --> 01:23:24.263
1966.

01:23:24.296 --> 01:23:26.798
Damn. This is just one year?

01:23:27.599 --> 01:23:30.069
London's a bad place.

01:23:35.006 --> 01:23:38.877
Library
will be closing in 15 minutes.

01:24:13.112 --> 01:24:15.013
That was quick.

01:24:50.014 --> 01:24:51.783
Fuck this!

01:25:00.959 --> 01:25:02.894
Did you see that?

01:25:02.927 --> 01:25:05.897
Ashley, she could have
fucking killed her.

01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:07.632
It's okay.

01:25:08.234 --> 01:25:09.268
It's okay.

01:25:09.301 --> 01:25:11.137
It's not fucking okay.

01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:12.971
What the actual fuck?!

01:25:13.004 --> 01:25:14.373
Security!

01:25:14.406 --> 01:25:15.874
Stay here.

01:25:15.907 --> 01:25:18.144
Jocasta! Jocasta, wait!

01:25:18.177 --> 01:25:19.677
Security!

01:25:19.711 --> 01:25:20.879
Stop!

01:25:20.912 --> 01:25:22.747
Jocasta, it was an accident.

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:24.416
An accident?
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:25:24.450 --> 01:25:26.085
Security!

01:25:39.231 --> 01:25:40.932
<i>What happened to me?</i>

01:25:40.965 --> 01:25:44.403
<i>What happened to me?
What happened to me?</i>

01:25:44.436 --> 01:25:45.970
<i>What happened to me?</i>

01:25:46.004 --> 01:25:47.805
<i>What happened to me?
What happened to me?</i>

01:25:47.839 --> 01:25:49.841
<i>What happened to me?</i>

01:25:49.874 --> 01:25:51.277
<i>What happened to me?</i>

01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:52.911
<i>What happened to me?</i>

01:25:52.944 --> 01:25:54.446
<i>What happened to me?</i>

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.483
<i>What happened to me?
What happened to me?</i>

01:25:57.516 --> 01:25:59.451
<i>What happened to me?</i>

01:25:59.485 --> 01:26:02.188
<i>What happened to me?
What happened to me?</i>

01:26:02.221 --> 01:26:03.788
<i>What happened to me?</i>

01:26:03.821 --> 01:26:06.091
<i>What happened to me?
What happened to me?</i>

01:26:06.125 --> 01:26:07.725
<i>What happened to me?</i>

01:26:07.759 --> 01:26:09.894
<i>What happened to me?
What happened to me?</i>

01:26:12.531 --> 01:26:14.066
<i>What happened to me?</i>

01:26:14.099 --> 01:26:16.435
<i>What happened to me?
What happened to me?</i>

01:26:16.468 --> 01:26:18.170
<i>What happened to me?</i>

01:26:18.204 --> 01:26:19.771
Oi!

01:26:19.804 --> 01:26:21.839
Where do you think you're going?

01:26:22.874 --> 01:26:24.809
You think you can just
walk away?

01:26:41.126 --> 01:26:44.096
Leave me alone!

01:26:54.406 --> 01:26:57.243
Hey, come back here, you slut!

01:26:57.276 --> 01:27:00.446
Get back here, whore!

01:27:00.479 --> 01:27:03.848
I'm talking to you, sandie!

01:27:03.881 --> 01:27:06.185
Leave me alone!

01:27:23.335 --> 01:27:25.504
Jack?

01:27:27.506 --> 01:27:30.309
Jack! Jack!

01:27:31.577 --> 01:27:34.046
Jack!

01:27:35.047 --> 01:27:36.814
Jack!

01:27:51.130 --> 01:27:52.930
Where the hell have you been?

01:27:52.964 --> 01:27:54.433
I've been covering you
downstairs

01:27:54.466 --> 01:27:56.901
for the last hour,
for fuck's sake.

01:27:56.934 --> 01:27:59.937
Ellie, get down
in that basement, girl.

01:27:59.971 --> 01:28:02.274

You know your siren song
is playing?

01:28:47.553 --> 01:28:50.489
I just put this on the jukebox,

01:28:50.522 --> 01:28:53.092
and lo and behold, you appear.

01:28:53.125 --> 01:28:55.094
Carol was worried about you.

01:28:55.127 --> 01:28:56.628
Thought you'd gone missing.

01:28:56.662 --> 01:28:59.997
I told her no one ever
really disappears.

01:29:00.032 --> 01:29:04.001
They're always around somewhere.

01:29:04.670 --> 01:29:06.971
- I'm right here.
- Aren't you just?

01:29:07.004 --> 01:29:10.075
I'll have a pint
of numbers, love.

01:29:13.445 --> 01:29:16.281
- I hear you were quite the ladies' man.
- Were?

01:29:17.282 --> 01:29:18.517
How dare you?

01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:20.252
Still am.

01:29:20.285 --> 01:29:21.653
You never lose it.

01:29:21.687 --> 01:29:23.655
You knew a lot
of the girls round here?

01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:25.257
A lot of 'em?

01:29:26.058 --> 01:29:27.659
I knew all of 'em.

01:29:27.693 --> 01:29:29.228
Sandie?

01:29:30.429 --> 01:29:32.464

No.

01:30:00.459 --> 01:30:02.026
I knew all the girls.

01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.962
Like to think
I looked after 'em.

01:30:04.996 --> 01:30:07.433
Had to keep them
in order, too, mind.

01:30:07.466 --> 01:30:09.568
Keep 'em in line.

01:30:09.601 --> 01:30:12.970
Sandie, she was special, though.

01:30:13.004 --> 01:30:14.972
She didn't belong.

01:30:15.006 --> 01:30:17.543
I thought she was
too good for it.

01:30:18.477 --> 01:30:21.180
But, you know,
at the end of the day,

01:30:21.213 --> 01:30:23.981
you all look the same on a slab.

01:30:26.084 --> 01:30:28.287
I know what you did.

01:30:30.088 --> 01:30:33.525
I've done a lot of things,
Eloise.

01:30:33.559 --> 01:30:36.728
You're gonna have to be
more specific, love.

01:30:36.762 --> 01:30:39.598
I know what you did to sandie.

01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:42.367
- Do you, now?
- Mm.

01:30:42.401 --> 01:30:44.336
Yeah, I saw her.

01:30:44.369 --> 01:30:46.472
I see her.

01:30:46.505 --> 01:30:48.240
I know what happened.

01:30:48.273 --> 01:30:50.642
Well, whatever happened
to sandie,

01:30:50.676 --> 01:30:52.578
she brought it on herself.

01:30:52.611 --> 01:30:55.481
But no one deserves that.

01:30:55.514 --> 01:30:57.149
Listen.

01:30:57.182 --> 01:31:01.053
I know where you live, Eloise.

01:31:01.086 --> 01:31:04.089
And I don't know
what you've seen or heard,

01:31:04.122 --> 01:31:06.625
but I can tell you
sandie ended up

01:31:06.658 --> 01:31:09.026
exactly where she wanted to be.

01:31:09.061 --> 01:31:12.264
Funny you mention her, though,

01:31:12.297 --> 01:31:14.333
because the first thing I did

01:31:14.366 --> 01:31:18.537
when I dragged myself back
to this miserable smoke

01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:22.541
was to look up her old bones.

01:31:22.574 --> 01:31:27.346
But turns out some people
don't want to be found.

01:31:28.747 --> 01:31:30.249
But you killed her.

01:31:30.282 --> 01:31:32.384
You think I killed sandie?

01:31:32.417 --> 01:31:34.553
I know you did!

01:31:34.586 --> 01:31:38.524
Ha! I think you'll find
Alex killed sandie.

01:31:38.557 --> 01:31:40.158
Come back.

01:31:40.192 --> 01:31:43.262
Nah. I've had enough
of this line of questioning.

01:31:43.295 --> 01:31:46.532
You think she was an angel,

01:31:46.565 --> 01:31:48.467
but don't be fooled.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:49.768
I'm recording this.

01:31:49.801 --> 01:31:51.303
You won't get away with it!

01:31:51.336 --> 01:31:54.806
So what?
I do what I like in this manor.

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.642
The police know! I told them!

01:31:56.675 --> 01:31:59.545
Like I give a flying fuck.

01:31:59.578 --> 01:32:01.413
Look, wait!

01:32:01.446 --> 01:32:03.148
When you see Alex

01:32:03.181 --> 01:32:05.751
in whatever little hell
she's currently in,

01:32:05.784 --> 01:32:07.419
you tell her I said hello.

01:32:13.792 --> 01:32:15.427
Oh, my good god.

01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.162
Jesus.

01:32:18.497 --> 01:32:20.299
- What happened?
- He just stopped

01:32:20.332 --> 01:32:22.601
in-in the middle of the street.

01:32:22.634 --> 01:32:25.137
Oh, Lindsey, you poor bastard.

01:32:25.170 --> 01:32:27.439
Call an ambulance, pet.

01:32:27.472 --> 01:32:28.774
Now!

01:32:28.807 --> 01:32:31.343
And tell 'em
he used to be police.

01:32:31.376 --> 01:32:34.279
- That'll make them hurry.
- Right. Okay.

01:32:34.313 --> 01:32:36.114
Lindsey?

01:32:36.148 --> 01:32:38.383
- He's police?
- Yeah, he's ex-vice.

01:32:38.417 --> 01:32:40.652
He used to be a copper in soho
for years and years,

01:32:40.686 --> 01:32:44.723
working the red light district,
and now look at him.

01:32:44.756 --> 01:32:48.727
Then his name's not Jack?

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.861
Jack?

01:32:49.895 --> 01:32:51.797
No, love.

01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:53.632
That's Lindsey.

01:32:55.467 --> 01:32:57.269
Yeah, he looks very bad.

01:32:57.302 --> 01:32:58.746
I reckon you're a copper
or something.

01:32:58.770 --> 01:33:01.473
<i>I reckon
you're a copper or something.</i>

01:33:01.506 --> 01:33:02.708
Do you, now?

01:33:02.741 --> 01:33:05.410
<i>Do you, now?</i>

01:33:05.444 --> 01:33:08.747
<i>I'd get out while you can, girl.</i>

01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:11.116
Ellie?

01:33:12.618 --> 01:33:14.419
Ellie!

01:33:21.226 --> 01:33:22.761
<i>I've let you down.</i>

01:33:22.794 --> 01:33:24.363
<i>I've let mum down.</i>

01:33:24.396 --> 01:33:26.898
You haven't let anyone down.

01:33:26.932 --> 01:33:29.801
- You never could.
- Okay.

01:33:29.835 --> 01:33:31.937
Ellie, I don't know
what's happened,

01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:35.374
but it's okay to come home.

01:33:35.407 --> 01:33:37.376
You haven't failed anyone.

01:33:38.710 --> 01:33:41.246
I'll-I'll come and get you
first thing tomorrow.

01:33:41.279 --> 01:33:44.249
No, gran, I can't stay
another night.

01:33:44.282 --> 01:33:46.785
Well, uh, I'll get someone
to drive me now.

01:33:46.818 --> 01:33:48.720
Ellie?

01:33:48.754 --> 01:33:50.589
- Ellie?
- Hello?

01:33:51.556 --> 01:33:53.458
Hello?

01:33:53.492 --> 01:33:55.193
Look, I have someone
who can help.

01:33:55.227 --> 01:33:56.395
- El!
- I'll call you.

01:33:56.428 --> 01:33:57.663
Ellie? Eloise?

01:33:57.696 --> 01:33:59.665
- Ellie!
- John!

01:33:59.698 --> 01:34:01.700
John!

01:34:01.733 --> 01:34:03.435
Ellie.

01:34:04.436 --> 01:34:05.337
Thank god.

01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:07.839
I saw the flashing lights,
and I thought...

01:34:07.873 --> 01:34:09.274
I'm scared here.

01:34:09.307 --> 01:34:10.809
I'll take you back to yours.

01:34:10.842 --> 01:34:13.378
No, I want to go home.
Home, home.

01:34:13.412 --> 01:34:15.447
I-I need to get out of London.

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.416
Can you help me get
to the train station?

01:34:17.449 --> 01:34:19.551
Forget the train.
I'll drive you.

01:34:19.584 --> 01:34:21.319
You have a car?

01:34:21.353 --> 01:34:23.288
How else am I supposed to get

01:34:23.321 --> 01:34:25.624
to north London
from south London?

01:34:26.591 --> 01:34:28.527
<i>Right, I'm gonna go in there,</i>

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:31.697
<i>get my things and never see
that fucking room ever again.</i>

01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:33.699
<i>Do you want me
to come up and help?</i>

01:34:33.732 --> 01:34:35.467
<i>No, better not.
Ms. Collins would probably</i>

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.436
<i>kill you if she sees you again.</i>

01:34:37.469 --> 01:34:41.440
Maybe if I plead, she might
give me some of my deposit.

01:34:41.473 --> 01:34:42.607
Fuck.

01:34:47.746 --> 01:34:51.450
If I'm not back in 15 minutes,
maybe come check on me.

01:34:52.551 --> 01:34:54.486
Okay.

01:35:09.968 --> 01:35:12.437
Ms. Collins, it's me, Ellie.

01:35:12.471 --> 01:35:14.773
Just coming, deary.

01:35:17.743 --> 01:35:20.846
You look like
you've had a fright.

01:35:20.879 --> 01:35:22.848
I need your help.

01:35:23.849 --> 01:35:24.883
Just you, is it?

01:35:24.916 --> 01:35:26.785
Yeah.

01:35:26.818 --> 01:35:28.754
I'll put the kettle on. Come in.

01:35:31.556 --> 01:35:36.762
Your music upstairs got me
breaking out my old records.

01:35:36.795 --> 01:35:40.632
Oh, I picked up
a letter of yours by mistake.

01:35:40.665 --> 01:35:42.400
It's in that pile.

01:35:56.681 --> 01:35:59.085
Don't judge me
on the cigarettes.

01:35:59.118 --> 01:36:02.054
All that hoo-ha last night
got me going again.

01:36:02.088 --> 01:36:03.421
Sorry.

01:36:03.455 --> 01:36:05.390
Oh, it's not your fault.

01:36:05.423 --> 01:36:07.793
I was always on the edge
of starting again.

01:36:07.826 --> 01:36:09.828
So...

01:36:11.863 --> 01:36:13.632
How can I help you?

01:36:13.665 --> 01:36:16.535
Ms. Collins,
i-I'm really sorry to do this.

01:36:16.568 --> 01:36:18.436
I-I didn't want
to be this person,

01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:20.072
but I'm leaving tonight.

01:36:20.106 --> 01:36:21.940
Oh.

01:36:21.973 --> 01:36:23.675
Are you, now?

01:36:23.708 --> 01:36:26.812
I'm not having
a very good time here, and I...

01:36:26.845 --> 01:36:29.481
I really need to go back home,
and I promise...

01:36:29.514 --> 01:36:30.958
I promise I'll pay you
for the mirror,

01:36:30.982 --> 01:36:33.652
- but I really need some of my deposit.
- Slow down.

01:36:33.685 --> 01:36:35.987
I don't want to beg,
but this has been a disaster.

01:36:36.021 --> 01:36:38.690
Hush. Slow down.

01:36:38.723 --> 01:36:40.592
Drink your tea.

01:36:46.698 --> 01:36:50.069
You went to the police,
didn't you?

01:36:50.102 --> 01:36:53.972
About the room upstairs, hmm?

01:36:54.005 --> 01:36:55.607
Yeah.

01:36:57.008 --> 01:37:00.378
A nice police lady came round

01:37:00.412 --> 01:37:03.982
asking questions about you.

01:37:04.015 --> 01:37:07.419
About your well-being.

01:37:07.452 --> 01:37:10.822
Welfare check, she called it.

01:37:10.856 --> 01:37:13.725
Had me worried.

01:37:13.758 --> 01:37:16.962
You'd been saying
a girl died up there.

01:37:18.997 --> 01:37:20.432
- Sorry.
- Oh.

01:37:20.465 --> 01:37:23.135
It's funny 'cause...

01:37:23.169 --> 01:37:26.605
There is some truth in it.

01:37:27.839 --> 01:37:31.743
I hadn't thought about it
until you brought it up, but...

01:37:31.776 --> 01:37:35.847
A girl did die up there,
I suppose.

01:37:35.881 --> 01:37:37.749
The young me...

01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:42.654
That came to this big city.

01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:46.591
Sandie.

01:37:47.726 --> 01:37:50.896
<i>I had hopes and dreams like you.</i>

01:37:50.929 --> 01:37:53.199
I wanted to be a singer.

01:37:53.232 --> 01:37:55.101
I wanted to perform.

01:37:55.134 --> 01:37:56.902
To act.

01:37:56.935 --> 01:38:01.539
<i>Being a whore is a bit like
being an actress, I suppose.</i>

01:38:02.507 --> 01:38:05.577
You have to pretend
you're someone else.

01:38:05.610 --> 01:38:08.647
Someone that's not you.

01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.749
I'd pretend
I was somewhere else.

01:38:10.782 --> 01:38:12.450
<i>It's too late for you.</i>

01:38:12.484 --> 01:38:14.686
That this wasn't
happening to me.

01:38:15.854 --> 01:38:18.790
<i>Try and forget all those...</i>

01:38:18.823 --> 01:38:21.526
<i>All those men.</i>

01:38:21.559 --> 01:38:24.230
<i>Their faces.</i>

01:38:24.263 --> 01:38:25.697
I'd blank them out.

01:38:27.099 --> 01:38:28.600
I had to.

01:38:30.001 --> 01:38:32.570
<i>Make like they were nothing.</i>

01:38:33.772 --> 01:38:39.811
So, yes, you could say
sandie died in that room.

01:38:41.846 --> 01:38:45.151
She died in that room
a hundred times.

01:38:45.184 --> 01:38:46.818
And then one night...

01:38:49.121 --> 01:38:50.855
The man who put me there...

01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.961
The man who put me to work...

01:38:58.697 --> 01:39:00.999
The man who stole my dream...

01:39:05.171 --> 01:39:06.238
Well...

01:39:09.208 --> 01:39:10.942
I put a knife in him...

01:39:14.879 --> 01:39:16.481
A hundred times.

01:39:20.319 --> 01:39:22.221
And do you know what, Ellie?

01:39:22.254 --> 01:39:24.923
Oh, I can call you Ellie,
can't I?

01:39:24.956 --> 01:39:26.024
Yeah.

01:39:26.058 --> 01:39:27.892
It felt right, Ellie.

01:39:30.996 --> 01:39:33.598
All those bastards

01:39:33.631 --> 01:39:36.001
<i>who came ringing my bell,</i>

01:39:36.035 --> 01:39:38.570
<i>creeping up my stairs,</i>

01:39:38.603 --> 01:39:41.307
they sent me to hell, so...

01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:43.641
I sent them to theirs.

01:39:48.147 --> 01:39:49.981
The papers call them

01:39:50.015 --> 01:39:52.318
<i>missing persons.</i>

01:39:52.351 --> 01:39:55.754
As far as I'm concerned,
they were already lost.

01:39:57.323 --> 01:40:01.559
So they don't know
where they are.

01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:05.097
I say they didn't know
who they were.

01:40:06.664 --> 01:40:08.967
I was doing everyone a favor.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.637
I wasn't gonna be used anymore.

01:40:12.670 --> 01:40:15.274
I wasn't gonna let
this city break me.

01:40:15.307 --> 01:40:17.809
I'm so sorry.

01:40:17.842 --> 01:40:18.943
Why?

01:40:18.977 --> 01:40:21.280
It's not your fault.

01:40:21.313 --> 01:40:24.283
No, I mean I understand.

01:40:24.316 --> 01:40:26.718
I know what you've been through.

01:40:26.751 --> 01:40:27.919
Oh.

01:40:27.952 --> 01:40:30.089
Do you, now?

01:40:30.122 --> 01:40:33.658
Yeah, I didn't mean to get you
in trouble with the police.

01:40:33.691 --> 01:40:35.960
Oh, it's all right.

01:40:35.994 --> 01:40:37.962
They think you're mad.

01:40:37.996 --> 01:40:40.865
And it's not like
you're gonna tell anyone else.

01:40:40.899 --> 01:40:42.201
No. No, I'm not.

01:40:42.234 --> 01:40:44.303
Of course not. I-I would never.

01:40:44.336 --> 01:40:47.806
No. I mean...

01:40:47.839 --> 01:40:51.043
I know you're not
going to tell anyone else.

01:41:00.086 --> 01:41:03.955
Oh, don't worry. I'm not gonna
stab you like the others.

01:41:03.988 --> 01:41:07.293
I wouldn't do that to you. No.

01:41:07.326 --> 01:41:09.161
You're gonna go to sleep.

01:41:10.396 --> 01:41:13.032
And everyone will think you
just topped yourself because,

01:41:13.065 --> 01:41:16.135
you know, they all thought you
were going to do that anyway.

01:41:17.436 --> 01:41:21.107
They're all very concerned
about you.

01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:23.608
Bless.

01:41:24.876 --> 01:41:27.679
So, you...

01:41:27.712 --> 01:41:32.184
Just get comfy, and...

01:41:32.218 --> 01:41:35.087
You can doze off

01:41:35.121 --> 01:41:38.224
listening to some of
that nice music of yours.

01:41:39.891 --> 01:41:42.394
No more excitement
for you tonight.

01:41:52.338 --> 01:41:54.306
Just you, is it?

01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:56.007
Little liar!

01:42:02.214 --> 01:42:03.748
No.

01:42:03.781 --> 01:42:06.684
Just coming, deary.

01:42:28.307 --> 01:42:30.276
What is it?

01:42:30.309 --> 01:42:32.810
Um, I'm here to see Ellie.

01:42:32.844 --> 01:42:35.780
She's upstairs. Come on in.

01:42:39.218 --> 01:42:40.885
Run!

01:42:41.387 --> 01:42:44.089
