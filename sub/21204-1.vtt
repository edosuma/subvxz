00:48.840 --> 00:50.840
Let's keep moving! Let's go, come on!

00:53.590 --> 00:55.680
Let's go!
Go, go, go! Come on!

00:58.850 --> 01:01.450
Come on. On my six. Lets go!
Move it, go!

01:05.600 --> 01:06.810
Come on. come on, Come on!

01:16.320 --> 01:17.490
This way, this way!

02:06.620 --> 02:08.830
- The live is to fight.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.600
The fight is to live.

02:12.340 --> 02:16.340
And when all is lost, I will be found.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.060
- Hello!

05:37.830 --> 05:39.270
- Shh! Quiet!
- Who's there?

05:39.290 --> 05:41.790
- Quiet.
- Who's there?

05:41.920 --> 05:45.170
- Are you locked up, too?
- Yes, you need to be quiet.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.340
- What are we doing here?
- Shut up. You'll get us killed.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.640
- Please, tell me where we are.

05:58.940 --> 06:01.440
- The Police Station, you idiot!

06:02.770 --> 06:05.400
- Yes I know, where?
- In Narok.

06:05.530 --> 06:06.500
- Where is it?

06:06.920 --> 06:09.550
- 200 km from Nairobi.
- Are you lost?

06:09.570 --> 06:12.160
- Nairobi... Where is... where is Nairobi?

06:12.370 --> 06:14.490
- Is that a real question?
- Yeah.

06:15.620 --> 06:18.120
- The capital of Kenya.
- East Africa.

06:20.100 --> 06:21.510
- What am I doing here?

06:22.630 --> 06:24.300
- You sound American.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.650
- Yeah, I'm American.

06:31.690 --> 06:32.820
- You're not sure?

06:33.010 --> 06:34.310
- I'm...

06:37.060 --> 06:38.390
confused.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.650
- What's your name?

06:45.400 --> 06:46.530
- I don't know.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.480
The men who locked you up
probably beat you unconscious.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.790
- Who are you?

06:54.070 --> 06:55.150
- I'm a Doctor.

06:55.810 --> 06:59.110
I was working at the foreign
aid hospital for 2.5 years.

07:00.210 --> 07:02.130
The hospital is gone now.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.760
- So, who's out here fighting?

07:11.200 --> 07:13.080
What the hell is happening?

07:16.260 --> 07:17.850
- They're getting closer.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.220
- What...

07:43.580 --> 07:45.080
What the hell was that?

07:46.130 --> 07:47.920
- You really don't know?

07:53.220 --> 07:55.180
What's the last thing you remember?

07:55.200 --> 07:58.230
- Pain. Lots of pain.

07:58.940 --> 08:01.020
I just... woke up here.
I don't know.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.210
- You don't remember the invasion?

08:03.820 --> 08:06.410
- Who's invading?
- Not who...

08:07.520 --> 08:08.560
what.

08:17.150 --> 08:18.490
- Why are they doing this?

08:19.560 --> 08:21.670
Why here? Why in Kenya?

08:22.260 --> 08:23.620
- Not just here.

08:24.710 --> 08:25.750
Everywhere.

08:32.299 --> 08:33.799
- What do I gotta do?

08:37.080 --> 08:38.780
I'm not gonna die in here.

08:38.870 --> 08:40.830
- You die in here or out there.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.230
- No!

08:44.600 --> 08:46.100
- Hey!!
- Don't do that!

08:46.130 --> 08:47.960
Men are worse than machines.

08:47.980 --> 08:50.090
- In here.
- Machines kill quickly.

08:50.110 --> 08:52.060
- Inside!
- They'll kill you.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.090
And they'll do worse with me.

08:55.150 --> 08:56.410
- Why don't they hear me?

08:57.660 --> 08:58.830
- Idiot!

09:31.260 --> 09:33.890
<i>- Who you work for?
- Why are here locked up?</i>

09:34.040 --> 09:35.230
- I don't speak Gikuyu.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.760
- I don't speak Gikuyu.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.700
- He wants to know who you work for
and why you are locked up.

09:43.420 --> 09:44.810
- Americans?

09:45.180 --> 09:46.640
<i>- Keep him alive.</i>

09:48.160 --> 09:50.200
<i>She is mine.</i>

09:50.380 --> 09:52.800
<i>- No, she's mine.</i>

09:55.050 --> 09:58.220
- What are you saying?
- I'm negotiating.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.750
<i>- Maybe I can take him
and get him a present.</i>

11:18.620 --> 11:19.650
- Don't you move!

12:34.040 --> 12:37.500
- You came back for me?
- Yeah. Of course.

12:39.130 --> 12:40.340
Are you okay?

12:42.970 --> 12:44.760
- My name is Nadia.

12:44.880 --> 12:45.720
- Nadia.

12:46.870 --> 12:47.870
Hi.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.950
- Look, I still don't know...

12:57.020 --> 12:58.360
I'll call you Bo.

13:00.680 --> 13:01.600
- Bo?

13:07.540 --> 13:09.990
We'll find my base, get you safe.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.060
- Nowhere is safe.

13:15.100 --> 13:19.770
- I saw a bomber plane out there.
- I saw trucks, I saw men fighting.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.800
- And so many dying.

13:23.050 --> 13:26.630
- What did they do to him?
- They're getting foreigners.

13:27.730 --> 13:29.320
Nowhere is safe.

13:40.230 --> 13:43.940
There's a US Army base north of here.
But you'll never make it there.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.440
The machines are hunting everyone down.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.610
- So we'll avoid populated areas.
- Stick to the open road.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.850
Behind that red car.
That looks OK.

13:52.980 --> 13:54.690
- Could be a drop.
- Could be.

13:54.910 --> 13:58.500
- Cars make noise and might attract them.
- Yeah, it might.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.670
You said there is a US Base to the north.
How far?

14:06.120 --> 14:09.160
- I don't know. Hundreds
of miles or more.

14:09.270 --> 14:11.230
- Well, we better start driving.

14:12.850 --> 14:16.840
- I'm nothing going with you.
- You got somewhere else you got to be?

14:18.580 --> 14:19.590
- No!

14:22.560 --> 14:24.980
- Doesn't mean that I want
to hide out on the road.

14:29.110 --> 14:32.900
All you'll find on that base
is the lot of dead bodies.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.310
- Yeah, maybe.

14:35.410 --> 14:38.450
We could also find them in a bunker
coordinating with the Pentagon.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.270
You don't get it.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.780
8 days ago every satellite
fell out of the sky.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.170
Every one.

14:50.370 --> 14:51.840
There is no more Pentagon.

14:54.890 --> 14:56.310
There's nothing we can do.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.190
Well, I'm not ready to quit.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.980
If you had people on that base, you'd
do anything you could to get to them.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.380
I believe I do.

15:16.820 --> 15:18.900
and I want you to
help me find them.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.920
You're acting like you're on a mission.
You're not. Just scared.

15:24.060 --> 15:25.290
Yeah, I'm scared.

15:26.400 --> 15:30.570
I don't know what I'm doing here,
but I know I gotta join this fight.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.230
You can do what you want.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.380
We're in luck.

16:11.610 --> 16:14.660
Engine runs.
Axles is in good shape.

16:14.780 --> 16:16.840
Just had to change a tire... so...

16:18.510 --> 16:21.330
I know how to change a tire,
but I still don't know my name.

16:21.890 --> 16:23.860
Oh, and I found this in the car.

16:24.330 --> 16:27.830
Only picking up static.
We just need a better signal.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.540
We'll need water and food.
I'll check the other cars.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.160
Fight!

17:41.700 --> 17:44.750
- If you're tired, I'll drive.
- I'm fine.

17:55.360 --> 17:59.570
You... handle a rifle pretty hell for a...

17:59.700 --> 18:01.910
- For a woman?
- For a Doctor.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.870
I was a medic in the French Army, and...

18:06.110 --> 18:09.410
Out here sometimes you have to put down
the vaccines and pick up the gun.

18:09.640 --> 18:13.560
This region, the world, was living
here long before the invasion.

18:13.590 --> 18:15.550
and the militia and the military...

18:15.670 --> 18:16.720
Get down!

18:20.140 --> 18:22.140
- Are you okay?
- I'm OK.

18:22.270 --> 18:25.360
We're outgunned. Step out very
slowly with your hands raised.

18:25.430 --> 18:29.060
Kenyan Army.
I speak Swahili. Follow my lead.

18:35.570 --> 18:37.200
<i>- Raise your hands high.</i>

18:37.230 --> 18:41.510
<i>0I'm a Doctor.
I work with freedom.</i>

18:42.310 --> 18:44.400
<i>This man is a soldier
In the US Army.</i>

18:44.490 --> 18:49.160
<i>All Kenyan soldiers have a mission
to take me to the border.</i>

18:49.310 --> 18:53.070
<i>- Whose orders?
- The American Army.</i>

18:56.550 --> 19:00.840
<i>There is no American Army here.
There is no American here.</i>

19:00.970 --> 19:03.940
<i>If you tell your people to lower
their weapons, do they do that?</i>

19:05.010 --> 19:07.760
<i>They should be under my command.</i>

19:08.150 --> 19:12.990
<i>Now we and the people
all need water.</i>

19:13.030 --> 19:18.200
<i>- We have water, we can share.
- How much water will you share?</i>

19:18.290 --> 19:21.050
<i>Hands up!
Do it now!</i>

19:21.080 --> 19:23.920
<i>- You have to go.
- You'll never be safe on the border.</i>

19:23.980 --> 19:27.820
<i>Radar.
He came from the Radar.</i>

19:28.000 --> 19:30.120
<i>- What do you mean?
- Quiet!</i>

19:30.250 --> 19:32.220
<i>Shoot him.</i>

19:41.300 --> 19:43.600
Drop your weapon. Drop it now!

19:49.930 --> 19:51.190
Stand!

19:52.100 --> 19:53.140
Stand up!

19:53.350 --> 19:56.360
Enough of this bullshit.
We're speaking English!

19:56.440 --> 19:59.280
What did he mean the Dish?
What does this symbol mean?

20:03.920 --> 20:07.970
The radio station. American.
Heavily guarded.

20:08.150 --> 20:11.190
Big satellite dish
with that symbol.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.630
Where is this compound?

20:15.230 --> 20:17.190
Through the border.
West from the mountains.

20:17.280 --> 20:21.240
West of the mountains.
Why did your men attack me?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.700
Many believe that this
machine's American made.

20:23.740 --> 20:24.620
What?

20:25.140 --> 20:28.590
or that the Americans use
those dishes to call them here.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.180
That's a lie!

20:31.130 --> 20:34.970
Everything else is destroyed,
But those dishes are still standing.

20:42.420 --> 20:44.970
Kill me!
Please kill me.

20:45.020 --> 20:46.400
Do it!

20:47.660 --> 20:48.920
What did you say?

20:49.030 --> 20:50.700
We need to go. Now!

20:57.250 --> 20:58.590
Get on your knees.

21:02.300 --> 21:03.470
Move it!

21:05.780 --> 21:07.330
The car's shot.

21:07.550 --> 21:08.610
That's OK.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.600
These guys are giving us their Jeep.

21:32.130 --> 21:37.960
500 KM FROM THE BORDER.

21:39.820 --> 21:42.300
You're dehydrated.
Drink some water.

21:52.530 --> 21:56.410
I can't believe you got out of there.
I thought you'd be killed.

21:56.560 --> 21:59.810
Those guys were trained soldiers
and we were outnumbered back there.

22:00.790 --> 22:04.620
You know what?
I bet you're a Special Forces or something.

22:04.820 --> 22:06.570
Special forces?

22:06.700 --> 22:11.240
You clearly have advanced combat skills.
And you speak several languages.

22:18.420 --> 22:21.040
So, that's where we're going
now, the Radar Station?

22:21.170 --> 22:24.010
To the border, west, into the mountains.

22:24.130 --> 22:25.750
It's big. We'll find it.

22:26.370 --> 22:29.790
Find the Americans, find food, shelter...

22:30.010 --> 22:32.560
Maybe someone there who knows your name.
Is that it?

22:34.950 --> 22:36.830
What if it is not safe?

22:38.360 --> 22:40.230
Like you said, nowhere is safe.

22:40.300 --> 22:43.810
I mean, what if the Kenyans are right?
What if the Americans are involved?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.550
- That's not possible.
- What if it is?

22:46.620 --> 22:49.730
We show up at the
door, and then what?

22:49.760 --> 22:51.190
Then we kill them!

22:54.680 --> 22:57.220
Didn't we say we'd avoid towns?

23:04.050 --> 23:06.210
Looks like we don't have a choice.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.770
Wait, wait, wait, wait stop!

23:24.320 --> 23:25.460
It's not good.

23:26.110 --> 23:28.130
Could be a power surge.

23:28.830 --> 23:30.430
Or something else.

24:02.580 --> 24:04.140
The car is shorting out.

24:05.380 --> 24:06.000
Go!

24:06.730 --> 24:07.730
Go, go!

24:44.080 --> 24:45.650
Don't stand there, run!

24:45.770 --> 24:48.570
We have to do something.
We can get its attention.

24:51.610 --> 24:53.820
Daddy!

25:40.020 --> 25:41.420
We couldn't help them.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.320
Someone's out there.

26:25.490 --> 26:26.820
Someone's listening,

26:28.680 --> 26:31.270
- No one is listening.
- You don't know that.

26:33.350 --> 26:34.350
Hello.

26:35.980 --> 26:36.980
Hello.

26:37.260 --> 26:39.680
Can I get a large Pizza?

26:39.710 --> 26:43.710
Actually, make it two large pizzas
with everything and extra cheese.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.840
My whole family was in Paris.

27:02.740 --> 27:06.070
All the big cities was
hit first in the heart, so...

27:07.950 --> 27:10.830
Truth is I just think how I...

27:16.490 --> 27:18.330
lost everyone.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.230
Maybe I'm all alone.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.890
It sounds easier that way.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.190
Maybe I was always the guy with the gun.

27:45.700 --> 27:47.660
Maybe I was an asshole.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.120
You know...

27:53.420 --> 27:55.500
I don't know how to say this.

27:59.860 --> 28:01.470
Fighter jets.

28:01.990 --> 28:03.990
You see? Someone is out there fighting.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.730
We haven't lost yet.

28:58.980 --> 29:01.570
- I heard it again.
- I don't hear anything.

29:01.690 --> 29:04.270
- Oh, I do.
- You hear the birds.

29:04.310 --> 29:05.140
It's not the birds.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.730
We can't keep stopping like this.
We gotta go faster.

29:08.820 --> 29:13.450
- The car was faster.
- Yeah, the car was faster.

29:20.420 --> 29:21.920
Do you hear it now?

29:50.150 --> 29:52.650
<i>missions have to move in two days now.</i>

30:00.160 --> 30:02.290
Look, it's just a tape.

30:03.550 --> 30:06.560
<i>We don't know if you can hear or...</i>

30:10.590 --> 30:14.180
<i>We have multiple reports of
explosions in downtown Nairob.</i>

30:14.200 --> 30:16.350
<i>Multiple explosions
downtown I tell yous.</i>

30:17.200 --> 30:19.730
<i>Ok. Everyone, I was told we
have to leave the station.</i>

30:19.760 --> 30:20.760
<i>Yes, yes, yes!</i>

30:21.870 --> 30:23.390
<i>Yes, yes, OK.</i>

30:23.940 --> 30:25.860
<i>We must fight...</i>

30:27.940 --> 30:29.610
<i>in these final hours...</i>

30:29.730 --> 30:31.950
<i>to refuse whatever
we were ever asked</i>

30:31.980 --> 30:35.590
<i>to by the United States,
Europe, Asia...</i>

30:36.410 --> 30:38.140
<i>it is the final days...</i>

30:38.610 --> 30:41.060
<i>Right here in Africa, in Kenya</i>

30:41.280 --> 30:42.860
<i>in the streets of Nairob...</i>

30:43.060 --> 30:45.330
<i>the cradle of civilization may now...</i>

30:45.560 --> 30:48.300
<i>may now be humankind's last hope...</i>

30:48.630 --> 30:51.890
<i>Kenya, we must come together.</i>

30:52.140 --> 30:55.270
<i>We must stand together,
we must fight together.</i>

30:55.540 --> 30:57.270
<i>Peace be with you Kenya.</i>

31:16.290 --> 31:17.790
- You hear that, don't you?
- Shut up!

31:17.810 --> 31:19.560
But they will kill us, all of us.

31:23.670 --> 31:26.010
<i>Hurry, they come, spread!</i>

31:27.720 --> 31:31.260
We are all on the same side here.
Let us go.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.050
Let her go!

31:40.770 --> 31:43.650
Come on, come on, come on.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.050
Watch out!

31:50.320 --> 31:51.320
Keep low.

31:56.450 --> 31:58.960
- Why are they doing this?
- They're poachers.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.050
Look at them.
They're hunting.

32:01.690 --> 32:04.730
Waiting for their prey
and we're their bait.

32:06.810 --> 32:08.020
Hide!

32:18.600 --> 32:19.890
Just don't look.

34:31.080 --> 34:31.820
Go!

34:41.030 --> 34:42.199
Run.

35:08.230 --> 35:09.690
That's one down.

35:57.990 --> 35:59.950
Drop your weapon now!

36:05.510 --> 36:07.510
Sun glinted off your lens.

36:07.660 --> 36:10.750
I thought you were a sniper.
I could have shot you.

36:10.920 --> 36:13.960
If I was a Sniper,
you'd be dead already.

36:15.300 --> 36:18.010
Luckily these shots don't kill.

36:18.130 --> 36:19.970
- Are you hurt?
- No.

36:21.010 --> 36:23.010
Hurts when you graze your knee.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.140
- I'm dying.
- I'm a Doctor.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.040
Oh, congratulations,
but you're a bit late.

36:27.210 --> 36:30.260
- Let me have a look.
- No, please. Don't.

36:30.440 --> 36:33.100
Seeing the wound the first
time was bad enough.

36:34.700 --> 36:39.020
If we take this bandages off,
I don't think we're gonna get them back on.

36:39.310 --> 36:40.350
Do you?

36:43.020 --> 36:44.590
It's good to see you both.

36:45.040 --> 36:47.210
You are the first people I've
seen in days that are actually,

36:47.370 --> 36:49.160
breathing, moving around.

36:55.290 --> 36:57.100
I was in Kosovo in 1998.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.090
I saw terrible things.

37:00.040 --> 37:05.000
Kandahar, Congo.
Nothing like this. Nothing.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.440
So, what were you doing here?

37:07.170 --> 37:08.030
Here?

37:09.230 --> 37:10.330
My job.

37:10.790 --> 37:13.000
When the ships came down,
I made a promise to myself..

37:13.050 --> 37:15.730
that I wouldn't stop shooting
until the battery died or I did.

37:15.990 --> 37:17.120
Ships?

37:17.940 --> 37:20.430
The ships pulling people into the sky.

37:21.020 --> 37:22.940
Where have you been, under a rock?

37:24.890 --> 37:28.050
I got some great shots of the
ship landing. You can see this...

37:28.350 --> 37:29.350
Oh God!

37:32.330 --> 37:33.950
Here, look at this!

37:34.130 --> 37:38.430
I was on assignment.
6 weeks doing a story on child soldiers.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.000
These kids may have had nothing,

37:40.030 --> 37:42.120
but they have all the
strength in the world.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.630
I traveled with them.

37:43.690 --> 37:46.860
As we move toward the city,
a storm closed in.

37:47.010 --> 37:51.140
I didn't know it then, but
they taking over our power grid.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.530
Using it. The world started to fall.

37:56.170 --> 38:01.180
Everyone fled, but the child
soldiers, they pressed forward.

38:01.330 --> 38:03.420
Then came the ships. Look!

38:06.590 --> 38:09.430
I left the city,
as the ground forces moved in.

38:11.560 --> 38:12.690
Yeah.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.580
So, shot of a lifetime.

38:18.670 --> 38:21.340
A child facing down a giant.

38:22.590 --> 38:25.630
This is it.
This is the human spirit!

38:29.260 --> 38:31.970
Tomorrow this picture could
rally the resistance.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.620
That's why it has to live on.

38:33.730 --> 38:36.350
That's why the heavenly
father sent you here.

38:39.270 --> 38:41.190
- We have to go.
- We can't just leave him here.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.440
- Yes you can!
- No! I won't!

38:45.700 --> 38:46.740
Come on!

39:04.000 --> 39:07.090
- Drink this!
- Don't spill on me.

39:08.340 --> 39:10.010
Is that where you're from?

39:11.550 --> 39:13.540
That's where we're going.
Do you know it?

39:14.190 --> 39:15.290
I came that way.

39:15.350 --> 39:17.240
Northwest of here across
the mountain plateau.

39:17.270 --> 39:20.520
- So it's still standing?
- Yeah. was a few days ago.

39:20.650 --> 39:23.810
We've seen it from a distance,
but we've lost it.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.970
I took a picture of the dish.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.590
I took pictures with????????????

39:30.700 --> 39:33.680
If you're a clever little soldier, you
could work out where I took each picture.

39:34.150 --> 39:38.960
Then you can track the way there
like digital record.

39:42.420 --> 39:44.500
I'll trade you.

39:44.630 --> 39:47.130
My camera for a bullet.

39:48.550 --> 39:49.530
What?

39:51.140 --> 39:54.560
I have seen soldiers bleed
out on the field for days.

39:54.680 --> 39:55.930
It's not gonna happen.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.980
Now, you want my camera
And I want to give it you.

39:59.100 --> 40:01.440
You can either pry it out
of my hands and be off,

40:01.560 --> 40:03.840
or you can honor a dying
man's last request.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.740
- Don't make us do this.
- Don't make me beg.

40:10.860 --> 40:13.160
I know she won't do it. She's a doctor.
She's taken a bloody oath,

40:13.280 --> 40:15.390
But you, you're a trained soldier.

40:16.290 --> 40:18.790
You only kill people who want to live.

40:18.910 --> 40:20.120
Stop talking.

40:24.500 --> 40:25.730
Every second you delay,

40:25.760 --> 40:29.450
is a second you put her life in danger.
You know that, now, come on.

40:29.550 --> 40:31.090
You do your job.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.260
I'm not gonna shoot you!

40:46.900 --> 40:49.900
Doctor. Soldier.

40:50.020 --> 40:53.900
Your sole purpose is to
heal, his is to harm.

40:54.030 --> 40:57.450
And to get out you got to cancel
each other out, now don't you?

40:57.580 --> 40:58.870
You have to kill me!

40:58.900 --> 41:01.110
- And wouldn't someone...
- Be quiet!

41:01.140 --> 41:03.050
You're useless, aren't you? Aren't you?

41:03.250 --> 41:06.210
- Be quiet.
- You want me to be quiet?

41:06.340 --> 41:08.050
You're gonna have to shut me up.

41:13.640 --> 41:16.510
Shut me up, you son of a bitch!

41:22.980 --> 41:24.900
Is this what you want?

44:42.470 --> 44:46.600
The fight is to live and when
all is lost, I have to find it.

45:30.310 --> 45:32.560
He took the picture standing right here.

45:35.190 --> 45:36.770
He came this way.

45:42.820 --> 45:44.660
- Damn it.
- What?

45:44.780 --> 45:46.010
The battery.

45:46.660 --> 45:47.800
Are you kidding?

45:48.660 --> 45:52.330
This camera was our only chance of
finding the dish, now it's dead.

45:53.580 --> 45:56.290
- I told you we would never get there.
- We'll get there.

45:59.050 --> 46:02.970
Look, we're close. There are
only few more pictures left.

46:07.470 --> 46:08.720
Damn it.

46:31.870 --> 46:37.460
Now this... this is an awesome car.
It's an American car.

46:37.580 --> 46:41.050
- It doesn't look like it will run.
- She'll run.

46:48.470 --> 46:50.050
Come on. Come on.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.360
Get in!

48:54.470 --> 48:58.980
When the invasion began, people were
saying there were unmanned drones.

48:59.100 --> 49:03.900
No pilot inside. Just
machines programmed to kill.

49:05.610 --> 49:08.110
Drone warfare from god knows where.

49:09.900 --> 49:14.200
They must have some weakness.
Something we can use against them.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.620
We should go.

49:42.810 --> 49:43.850
Go! Go!

49:49.030 --> 49:50.570
Go, Go, go, go!

49:52.530 --> 49:55.620
- Come on.
- Come on, go faster.

50:00.540 --> 50:03.250
- They are too fast.
- Oh, god, there's so many!

50:11.840 --> 50:14.010
Go fast, the house. Go for the house!

50:14.130 --> 50:15.260
I'm going.

50:16.300 --> 50:17.550
Come on. Come on.

50:19.140 --> 50:20.270
Hang on!

50:37.490 --> 50:38.870
Nadia, here!

50:39.990 --> 50:41.080
Come on!

50:45.790 --> 50:47.460
Go, go, go, go, go!

50:58.850 --> 50:59.970
I got you.

51:50.970 --> 51:51.970
No!

58:05.610 --> 58:07.020
- Look at me. Look at me.

58:07.940 --> 58:10.740
I'm out of bullets... I'm out of bullets.

58:11.470 --> 58:14.160
Foxtrot this is Bravo One.

58:14.610 --> 58:17.330
- Foxtrot, do you copy?
- You got... you gotta kill me.

58:17.350 --> 58:18.740
You got to kill me.

58:19.660 --> 58:21.510
There's no one coming.
No one!

58:21.820 --> 58:22.490
Please!

58:22.510 --> 58:25.100
Someone's coming, somebody's coming. I'm
gonna get you help. I'm gonna get you help.

58:25.120 --> 58:27.810
- You'll gonna kill me?
- You need to be quiet.

58:27.830 --> 58:31.470
No one's coming. Please, you gotta do it!

58:33.720 --> 58:34.930
Please...

58:37.330 --> 58:38.330
Please...

58:39.190 --> 58:40.190
Please...

58:43.270 --> 58:46.360
To live is to fight.
Say it one more time.

58:47.110 --> 58:48.520
To live is to fight.

58:49.190 --> 58:50.860
To fight is to live.

58:51.900 --> 58:53.530
When all is lost,

58:54.800 --> 58:56.570
you will be fine.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.310
There he is.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:20.450
- We're the ones who found you.
- We carried you, you big bastard.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.990
- Where am I?
- On Day One...

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.750
Some of the staff members from a
nearby medical center set up a triage.

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:31.410
- You're safe down here.
- Yeah, safe, for now.

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:34.500
You have to forgive my friend.
He worries too much.

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.670
Now, we are friends.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.930
Thanks.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.260
I feel born again.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:46.930
I'm Kara, He's Juma.
What is your name?

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:57.490
- And then they took her.
- Yeah, that's what they do.

01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:59.530
They didn't kill her, they...

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.970
They took her and
then they vanished.

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.040
- We've all lost people here.
- I've got to find her.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.010
- You can't find her; they have her now.
- You don't understand.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.420
I didn't know who I was.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.170
- and now...
- Now she's gone.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:20.010
Look man, the ships, they take
people and don't come back.

01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:24.010
But you are here now with us.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.730
So an American soldier wakes up alone.

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:35.750
in a jail cell somewhere near Nairobi.
Then no memory.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.430
Walks god knows how many
kilometers to get here.

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:43.490
and then the ship comes,
they take her friend.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.910
So why didn't they take you?

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.120
We should take him to see Roderick.

01:01:58.380 --> 01:01:59.580
Roderick!

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.240
<i>Sorry, I didn't hear.</i>

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.760
- This is the guy we found on the street.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.730
- Roderick Mburu, Army engineer.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.230
- You're... it looks like you're
building a weapon here.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.700
- Not just a weapon, an EMP.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.680
A high-voltage burst of energy,
just like a lightning bolt.

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:22.710
We have been running
test on smaller devices

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:25.560
and just yesterday we got
the frequency just right.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.270
Now I can calibrate
the big girl.

01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:30.020
The chief is getting her to
the right spot.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.600
You see, Rod's got this crazy
idea to detonate it under a ship.

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:33.760
Do some real damage.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.500
It's not crazy.

01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:38.920
The problem is the ships only hover
low enough over huge crowds of people.

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:41.050
a crowd surrounded by drone.

01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:44.050
The idea is to put a grenade
under a hornet's nest.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.260
We've never even gone close.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:50.180
Rod, they didn't take him.

01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:54.510
- What do you mean?
- They took his friend and left him behind.

01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:57.120
They didn't take you?

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.030
<i>Roderick, over.</i>

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.820
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:08.810
Go.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:15.960
<i>The drones are revering into the
city, I've never seen this before.</i>

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.630
<i>- How many?
- A lot.</i>

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:22.050
<i>They are very fast.
They come from two sides.</i>

01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:23.800
<i>- How long do we have?</i>

01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:27.590
- We need to move fast now.
- Every single person.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.840
Wait.

01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:33.010
- The drone didn't take him.
- They must have tracked us.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.390
Tracked?

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:39.730
To live is to fight. To fight is to live.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.190
- It's me.
- What?

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.330
I remember.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:59.440
They planted something in me. In my spine.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.980
- What are you talking about?
- I lead them here.

01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:04.800
I think they attack some of
us to find the rest of us.

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:08.820
They always follow me. They follow me
and then they killed everyone else.

01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:12.320
They took Nadia. They are on
their way here right now.

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:14.030
There's your proof.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.710
You never should have brought me here.
I've just killed all of you.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.110
If the drones followed you here,

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.650
maybe they'll turn away if I
blow your goddam brains off!

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.050
<i>- Kara, put down your weapon.
- No.</i>

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:29.470
- Kara, they're already coming.
- He brought them here.

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.180
Don't kill each other, Kara.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:35.430
If you don't kill me, they'll follow me.
Let me lead them the way.

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:37.290
Well, it's too late for that!

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:49.890
You can shoot me
or you can let me help.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.700
You need me.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.790
I am the only one who can
get the CNP under the ship.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.060
Every day I watch the drones throw out
people into this passage over here...

01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:13.840
and the ships just take them away.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.440
Beneath the station there is a
network of service tunnels.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.890
That’s our best shot.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:20.560
And the closest endpoint
is the tunnel over here.

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:24.020
So we've got to get the EMP
across town, through the tunnels,

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:26.360
- and then under the drones.
- And under the ship.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.690
Then what happens?

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:31.200
Well, I do not know how they work,
but I do know Electromagnetism.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.790
And once the ENP blasts off, the
ships and the drone are gonna fall.

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.860
What happens to the
people inside the ships?

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:41.300
Look, the people that we can save
are the ones on the ground, now.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:47.630
America off the map.
China, Europe, all of it's gone.

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:49.530
For all we know, we're the last ones left.

01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:52.920
Though, we have to do this, for everyone.

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:56.340
Let's go, guys.

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:32.300
Come on guys, come on! We
don't have much time. Come on.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:39.860
Alright. Here are the
magnetic grenades. here.

01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:42.680
Shoulder-fired rockets. Real stealthy.

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:44.360
Jealous?

01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:47.730
Alright, guys. This is my baby, OK?

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:49.440
So I'm gonna make
sure she delivers.

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:52.050
Just in case I am not the one
hitting the fuze, listen up.

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:55.610
The four power packs, they go over here.

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:58.620
To detonate, we first hit the
primal switch,

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:02.290
- Then the kill switch.
- Primal switch, kill switch, let's go!

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:13.420
It's here, it's here.

01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:02.180
Let's go.

01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:57.900
- Everybody got out of this level.
- Move.

01:09:58.030 --> 01:10:00.860
Get back to the main camp!

01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:04.910
We're leaving this area now. Come on guys.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:27.220
That is not our exit. Let's keep going.

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:41.860
Come on!

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.520
Kara?

01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:49.910
There's more to come, come on!

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.660
Go, go! No, we took you.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.540
- Get out of here.
- No, we'll carry you.

01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:57.130
Give me your grenade!

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:00.460
All!

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.480
- I promised I was going to take you back.
- No!

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.400
- You must never look back.
- You have 3 seconds after you pull the pen.

01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:23.900
Go!

01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:29.830
Roderick, Come on. Let's go.

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.610
Wait.Wait.

01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:15.370
Wait.

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:21.230
So many people.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.940
The blast radius is 100 meters.

01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:29.860
It get to detonate
directly underneath the ship...

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.470
But these people will be taken.

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.490
Got to get it just right.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.380
We got to get these people out of here.

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:50.880
See, those drones form a cage.
We gotta open the door.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:53.680
Find the grenade count.

01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:57.140
Last one.

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.610
To live is to fight.

01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:06.820
Everyone's out. Come on, guys.
Let's go, let's go!

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.150
They're coming. They're coming.

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.240
Come on. Come on., get out of here.
Let's go!

01:15:33.650 --> 01:15:35.610
Move!

01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:42.790
You got it! Come on!

01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:52.460
Over here, Roderick.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.780
They’re coming through the vents.

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.430
Come on. Come on.

01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:49.650
Battery damaged..

01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:51.980
It's not gonna work.

01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:35.290
- Look at me. Look at me.
- I'm out of bullets.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:38.760
Foxtrot Foxtrot Bravo One.
We have to evacuate everything.

01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:46.050
- There's no one coming.
- You sound American.

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:49.100
- Please.
- I'm not gonna die in here.

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:50.890
So shoot me.

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:54.060
- To live is to fight.
- There's no more time.

01:18:54.190 --> 01:18:58.940
To live is to fight. To fight is to live.

01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:02.950
And when all is lost, I will be found.

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:23.230
- What am I doing here?
- You sound American.

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:28.160
- American.
- You're not sure?

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.870
- I am confused.
- What's your name?

01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:33.330
- I don't know.
- You come back for me?

01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:36.000
My name is Nadia.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.880
Nadia?

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.890
OK, Mr.I don't know, I'll call you Bo.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.040
Bo?

01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:17.910
It worked.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.170
It worked.

01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:34.060
Are you okay?

01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:41.520
Washington.

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:43.440
What?

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:47.860
Washington.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.860
337 Washington Boulevard.

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.950
That's where I learned to ride a bike.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.120
That's where I grew up.

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:04.380
Okay, okay, soldier. So what's your name?

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:09.300
Bo.

01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:12.300
I'm going with Bo.
