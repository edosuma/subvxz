WEBVTT

00:03.360 --> 00:05.600
- Take a punt.
- [clara] right.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.100
Your choice. Wherever, whenever.

00:08.100 --> 00:12.140
- Anywhere in time and space.
- Well...

00:12.140 --> 00:18.210
...There is something, someone
that I've always wanted to meet.

00:18.210 --> 00:19.750
- But I know what you'll say.
- Try me.

00:19.750 --> 00:22.710
You'll say he's made up,
that there is no such thing.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.280
- Go on.
- It's...

00:26.450 --> 00:29.650
- It's robin hood!
- Robin hood?

00:29.660 --> 00:31.620
Yeah! I love that story.

00:31.630 --> 00:33.460
I've always loved it,
ever since I was little.

00:33.460 --> 00:36.430
Robin hood,
the heroic outlaw

00:36.430 --> 00:38.260
Who robs from the rich
and gives to the poor.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.300
- [giggles] yeah!
- He's made up.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.700
- There's no such thing.
- Oh! You see?

00:42.700 --> 00:47.270
Old-fashioned heroes
only exist in old-fashioned
storybooks, clara.

00:47.270 --> 00:51.010
- What about you?
- Me?

00:51.010 --> 00:52.110
Yeah, you.

00:52.110 --> 00:54.710
You stop bad things happening
every minute of every day.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.350
That sounds
pretty heroic to me.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.690
Just passing the time.
Hey, what about mars?

01:01.690 --> 01:02.990
- What?
- The ice warrior hives!

01:02.990 --> 01:05.990
- You said it was my choice.
- Or the tumescent arrows

01:05.990 --> 01:08.460
Of the half-light.
Those girls can
hold their drink.

01:08.460 --> 01:10.960
- Doctor...
- And fracture
15 different levels

01:10.960 --> 01:14.670
Of reality simultaneously.
I think I've got
a polaroid somewhere.

01:14.670 --> 01:20.010
Doctor! My choice.
Robin hood. Show me.

01:20.010 --> 01:22.370
Very well.

01:24.340 --> 01:27.380
- [clara clears throat]
- [the doctor typing]

01:27.380 --> 01:30.020
Earth. England.

01:30.020 --> 01:32.780
- Sherwood forest.
- [giggles]

01:32.790 --> 01:35.620
1190 ad...

01:35.620 --> 01:37.760
- ...Ish.
- [electronic whirring]

01:37.760 --> 01:40.730
But you'll only
be disappointed.

01:40.730 --> 01:45.730
- Oh!
- [tardis whirring]

01:50.870 --> 01:54.270
[birds twittering]

01:58.510 --> 02:02.980
[tardis whirring]

02:03.550 --> 02:07.220
No damsels in distress,
no pretty castles,

02:07.220 --> 02:11.490
No such thing as robin hood.

02:18.900 --> 02:22.130
[man] you called?

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.740 --> 03:01.540
Very, very nicely done
with the box, sir!

03:01.540 --> 03:07.780
I saw a turk perform
something very similar
at nottingham fayre.

03:07.780 --> 03:10.750
It's a trick
with mirrors, no doubt?

03:10.750 --> 03:14.490
- A trick?
- A good jest. [laughs]

03:14.490 --> 03:17.520
This is not a trick,
this is a tardis.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.260
Whatever it is, you bony rascal,

03:19.260 --> 03:21.930
I'm afraid I must
relieve you of it.

03:21.930 --> 03:24.830
It's my property,
that's what it is!

03:24.830 --> 03:29.030
Well, don't you know
all property is theft
to robin hood?

03:29.040 --> 03:33.370
- You're not serious.
- I am many things, sir,
but I am never that.

03:33.370 --> 03:36.810
Robin hood laughs
in the face of all. Ha-ha-ha!

03:36.810 --> 03:41.350
- And do people ever punch you
in the face when you do that?
- Not as yet.

03:41.350 --> 03:43.250
Lucky I'm here then,
isn't it?

03:43.250 --> 03:46.420
Might be a little bit much,

03:46.420 --> 03:50.860
But... Ooh!
What do you reckon, doctor?

03:50.860 --> 03:54.330
By all the saints!

03:54.560 --> 03:56.260
Are there any more in there?

03:56.260 --> 03:59.260
- Is that...?
- No.

03:59.930 --> 04:02.100
Oh, my god!

04:02.440 --> 04:03.640
Oh, my god!
It is, isn't it?

04:03.640 --> 04:07.440
You found him.
You actually found robin hood.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.570
That is not robin hood!

04:09.580 --> 04:11.910
Well, then... Who, sir,

04:11.910 --> 04:15.580
Is about to relieve you
of your magic box?

04:18.920 --> 04:20.920
Nobody, sir!

04:20.920 --> 04:22.820
Not in this universe,
or the next.

04:22.820 --> 04:24.920
Well, then draw your sword
and prove your words.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.630
I have no sword.

04:26.630 --> 04:29.260
I don't need a sword.

04:29.260 --> 04:31.760
Because I am the doctor.

04:31.770 --> 04:34.770
And this is my spoon!

04:34.770 --> 04:37.070
En garde!

04:37.070 --> 04:40.410
- Ho-ho!
- [grunting]

04:40.410 --> 04:44.710
- [the doctor] ha-ha!
- [grunts]

04:44.710 --> 04:45.840
Oh!

04:45.850 --> 04:50.250
[both grunting]

04:52.220 --> 04:54.590
- [robin] ow!
- You're amazing.

04:54.590 --> 04:57.790
I've had some experience.
Richard the lionheart!

04:57.790 --> 04:59.290
Cyrano de bergerac!

04:59.290 --> 05:00.160
Errol flynn!

05:00.160 --> 05:02.630
- He had the most enormous...
- [clears throat]

05:02.630 --> 05:04.160
- [grunting]
- ...Ego!

05:04.160 --> 05:07.170
- Takes one to know one.
- [both grunting]

05:07.170 --> 05:11.140
- You!
- [grunting]

05:20.280 --> 05:23.550
[grunting]

05:25.990 --> 05:29.650
- Doctor!
- [blows]

05:29.660 --> 05:34.730
Like I said... My box.
[blows]

05:34.730 --> 05:36.190
Doctor?

05:38.530 --> 05:41.770
[the doctor yells]

05:41.770 --> 05:45.270
[robin, clara laughing]

05:48.970 --> 05:51.680
- [chickens clucking]
- [woman screams]

05:51.680 --> 05:53.240
In the name of all that's holy,

05:53.250 --> 05:55.450
Take our monies,
take our treasure,

05:55.450 --> 05:58.320
- But spare my ward!
- Nay, do not fuss.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.990
- All will be well.
- This is the sheriff's doing!

06:00.990 --> 06:04.760
If he were here now,
I'd tear out his black heart!

06:04.760 --> 06:07.590
- Would you now?
- [horse snorts]

06:07.590 --> 06:08.660
[woman screams]

06:08.660 --> 06:14.430
Or are you as milk-livered
as your name suggests,
master quayle?

06:14.430 --> 06:17.140
[quayle] take me!
Spare this dear child.

06:17.140 --> 06:21.510
Take you?
A lardy lack-wit like you?

06:21.510 --> 06:24.310
It's labour we require
up at the castle.

06:24.310 --> 06:28.850
Labour and gold,
not old men and their
worthless baubles.

06:28.850 --> 06:32.080
This will be a great help,
master quayle. Believe me.

06:32.090 --> 06:35.220
- Newcomer to sherwood,
are we?
- Yes, my lord.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.720
You may also prove useful.
Bring her.

06:37.720 --> 06:41.960
- [gasps]
- [quayle] your days
are numbered, you cur!

06:41.960 --> 06:44.100
[spits]

06:49.300 --> 06:51.470
You shall live to regret that.

06:51.470 --> 06:55.370
Actually... No.

06:56.010 --> 06:58.210
- You won't.
- [groans]

06:58.210 --> 07:01.110
No! No!

07:01.110 --> 07:05.320
[sobbing]

07:11.960 --> 07:14.830
[robin] let me introduce you
to my men.

07:14.830 --> 07:16.390
This is will scarlett.

07:16.400 --> 07:21.230
He is a cheeky rogue
with a good sword arm
and a slippery tongue.

07:21.230 --> 07:22.770
- My lady.
- [men laugh]

07:22.770 --> 07:24.340
- Ah!
- [whirring]

07:24.340 --> 07:25.540
What do you want
with my hair?

07:25.540 --> 07:27.740
Well, it's realistic,
I'll give you that.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.570
And this is friar tuck.

07:29.580 --> 07:32.240
Aptly named for the amount
of grub he tucks into.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.050
- You skinny blackguard! Oh!
- [men laugh]

07:35.050 --> 07:38.020
- What are you doing?!
- This isn't a real sandal!

07:38.020 --> 07:40.720
- Yes, it is!
- Oh, yes, it is.

07:40.720 --> 07:44.190
This, er, is alan-a-dale.

07:44.190 --> 07:46.020
He's a master of the lute,

07:46.030 --> 07:48.030
Whose music brightens up
these dark days.

07:48.030 --> 07:49.860
<i>â™ª fair stranger</i>
<i>you are welcome here â™ª</i>

07:49.860 --> 07:53.400
<i>â™ª in sherwood's bonny glade</i>
<i>and... â™ª</i> ow!

07:53.400 --> 07:57.040
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Blood analysis.

07:57.040 --> 08:00.870
- [beeps]
- oh, all those diseases.

08:00.870 --> 08:03.540
If you were real,
you'd be dead in six months.

08:03.540 --> 08:06.780
- I am real.
- Bye.

08:06.780 --> 08:10.520
[robin] and this is john little.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.450
Called little john.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.620
He's my loyal companion
in many an adventure.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.220
- [men laugh]
- [clara screams]

08:17.220 --> 08:21.760
- Gets 'em every time!
- [all laughing]

08:22.530 --> 08:25.230
Oh, I cannot
believe it's you.

08:25.230 --> 08:28.670
[laughs] you really are
robin hood and his merry men.

08:28.670 --> 08:32.970
Aye! That is an apt description.
Ha! What say you, lads?

08:32.970 --> 08:37.740
- [all cheering, laughing]
- stop laughing!

08:37.740 --> 08:39.780
Why are you always doing that?

08:39.780 --> 08:43.179
Are you all simple
or something?

08:44.179 --> 08:46.120
- I'm going to need a sample.
- Of what?

08:46.120 --> 08:48.450
[clara clears throat]
excuse me. Sorry.

08:48.460 --> 08:53.260
- Ahem. What are you doing?
- Well, they're not holograms,
that much is obvious.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.060
Could be a theme park
from the future.

08:55.060 --> 08:56.930
Or we might be
inside a miniscope!

08:56.930 --> 09:02.100
- Oh, shut up.
- A miniscope!
Yes, of course! Why not?

09:03.170 --> 09:07.870
Your friend... Seems not
quite of the real world.

09:07.870 --> 09:10.740
No. No, he's not really,
not most of the time.

09:10.740 --> 09:12.980
- [robin sighs]
- dark days?

09:12.980 --> 09:16.850
- My lady?
- You said that these were
dark days. What did you mean?

09:16.850 --> 09:22.090
King richard is away on crusade,
my lady. His tyrant
of a brother rules instead.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.160
And the sheriff? 'cause
there is a sheriff, right?

09:24.160 --> 09:27.560
Aye. It is indeed
this jackal of the prince's

09:27.560 --> 09:29.630
Who seeks to oppress us
for evermore.

09:29.630 --> 09:31.900
Or six months, in your case.

09:31.900 --> 09:36.400
It is a shame to dwell
on murky thoughts

09:36.400 --> 09:40.870
When there is
such beauty here.

09:40.870 --> 09:42.510
[chuckles]

09:42.510 --> 09:44.780
Why are you so sad?

09:47.410 --> 09:49.510
Why do you think me sad?

09:49.850 --> 09:53.550
Because the doctor's right.
You laugh too much.

09:53.890 --> 09:57.220
I do not live this
outlaw life by choice.

09:57.220 --> 09:59.320
You see before you robert,

09:59.330 --> 10:01.560
- Earl of lox...
- Earl of loxley!

10:01.560 --> 10:03.700
- ...Ley. Yes.
- Yes.

10:03.700 --> 10:06.330
Sorry. Do go on.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.470
I, erm...

10:08.470 --> 10:10.570
I had my lands and titles
stripped from me.

10:10.570 --> 10:14.340
I... I dared to speak out
against prince john.

10:14.340 --> 10:17.580
But I lost the thing
most dear to me.

10:17.580 --> 10:20.710
What was she called?

10:21.980 --> 10:25.850
So very quick. How does
the doctor stand it?

10:25.850 --> 10:29.150
- Marian?
- You know her?

10:29.160 --> 10:32.260
Oh, yes,
I have always known her.

10:32.260 --> 10:39.230
It was marian who told me that
I must stand up and be counted.

10:40.030 --> 10:43.900
But... I was afraid.

10:43.900 --> 10:48.170
Now, this green canopy
is my palace

10:48.170 --> 10:50.910
And the rough ground
my feather bed.

10:50.910 --> 10:52.310
Maybe one day,
we'll return home.

10:52.310 --> 10:56.580
But until that day, until that
day, it is beholden on me

10:56.580 --> 10:58.880
To be the man marian wanted,

10:58.890 --> 11:03.050
To be a hero for those this
tyrant sheriff slaughters.

11:03.060 --> 11:06.090
What time is it, mr hood?

11:06.090 --> 11:07.960
Somewhat after noon.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.860
No, no. Time of year.
What season?

11:10.860 --> 11:14.930
Oh, dame autumn has
draped her mellow skirts
about the forest, doctor.

11:14.930 --> 11:17.370
The time of mists
and harvest approaches...

11:17.370 --> 11:19.870
Yeah... All very poetic.

11:19.870 --> 11:25.180
But it's very green hereabouts,
though, isn't it? And,
like I said, very sunny.

11:25.180 --> 11:29.450
- [clara] so?
- Have you been to nottingham?

11:29.780 --> 11:33.350
- Climate change?
- It's 1190.

11:33.350 --> 11:34.850
You must excuse me.

11:34.850 --> 11:37.460
The sheriff has issued
a proclamation.

11:37.460 --> 11:41.560
And tomorrow,
there is to be a contest

11:41.560 --> 11:43.860
To find the best archer
in the land.

11:43.860 --> 11:47.800
And the bounty,
it's an arrow made of pure gold.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.570
No, don't go! It's a trap!

11:49.570 --> 11:50.770
[laughs] well, of course it is!

11:50.770 --> 11:54.840
But a contest to find
the best archer in the land?

11:54.840 --> 11:57.410
[laughs] there is no contest!

11:57.410 --> 11:59.480
[all laugh]

11:59.480 --> 12:04.420
Right! That isn't even funny!
That was bantering.

12:04.420 --> 12:08.150
I am totally
against bantering.

12:08.150 --> 12:10.820
How can you be so sure
he is not the real thing?

12:10.820 --> 12:16.290
- Because he can't be.
- When did you stop believing
in everything?

12:16.460 --> 12:20.700
When did you start believing
in impossible heroes?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.300
Don't you know?

12:25.500 --> 12:27.040
[chuckles]

12:27.040 --> 12:30.940
In a way,
it's rather sweet.

12:30.940 --> 12:33.950
[crunching]

12:33.950 --> 12:39.050
[whirring]

12:45.990 --> 12:48.790
[applause]

12:48.800 --> 12:51.700
[crowd cheering]

12:51.700 --> 12:56.430
In the contest
for the golden arrow,

12:56.440 --> 13:01.140
After ten rounds,
the battle is betwixt

13:01.140 --> 13:03.910
- Our lord sheriff...
- [scattered cheers]

13:03.910 --> 13:10.010
[herald] ...And the stranger
known as tom the tinker!

13:10.020 --> 13:11.950
[loud cheering]

13:11.950 --> 13:15.350
Perhaps not such a stranger
after all?

13:15.360 --> 13:18.260
[herald] take your places!

13:24.630 --> 13:29.530
Shall we make the contest
a little more interesting,
my lord?

13:29.540 --> 13:34.240
The targets seem a little close.
What say you? Another 20 paces?

13:34.240 --> 13:36.640
Why not?

13:39.810 --> 13:44.350
[crowd shouting]

13:51.860 --> 13:53.320
[crowd gasps]

13:53.330 --> 14:00.530
Now, tinker,
let us see thy true face.

14:02.900 --> 14:05.440
[crowd shouting]

14:07.170 --> 14:09.410
- Whoo-hoo!
- [cheering]

14:09.410 --> 14:13.140
[herald] ye gads!
He has split the arrow!

14:13.150 --> 14:17.480
Truly, he is the finest archer
in all England!

14:17.480 --> 14:23.650
Come forward, tinker,
and claim your prize.

14:23.660 --> 14:26.520
[crowd cheering]

14:26.690 --> 14:29.490
[crowd gasping]

14:29.830 --> 14:32.430
- [crowd applauding]
- [woman] who is he?

14:32.430 --> 14:33.930
He's full of surprises,
isn't he?

14:33.930 --> 14:38.940
I am the doctor. My skills as
a bowman speak for themselves.

14:38.940 --> 14:41.740
I claim my reward.

14:44.540 --> 14:46.040
A mere bauble.

14:46.050 --> 14:49.150
[crowd gasping]

14:49.150 --> 14:52.020
- I want something else.
- Name it.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.020
Enlightenment.

14:54.920 --> 14:58.460
[cheering]

15:03.760 --> 15:07.030
[cheering loudly]

15:10.570 --> 15:14.410
- [cheering]
- this is getting silly.

15:14.410 --> 15:16.110
[whirring]

15:16.280 --> 15:18.580
[all gasp]

15:21.350 --> 15:24.250
Fascinating. Seize him!

15:25.520 --> 15:28.890
- [groaning]
- what are you doing?
Put that down!

15:28.890 --> 15:30.920
I'm fine! I take year seven
for afterschool taekwondo.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.160
- Don't worry, doctor!
I'll save you!
- I don't need saving!

15:34.160 --> 15:35.460
- Your honour is safe.
- I know!

15:35.460 --> 15:38.960
- For I am robin!
- [all cheer]

15:38.970 --> 15:40.630
Robin hood!

15:40.630 --> 15:43.700
- Ah!
- [shouting]

15:46.070 --> 15:48.310
- [crowd gasping]
- [electrical fizzling]

15:48.310 --> 15:51.610
[man shouts] treachery!
Treachery!

15:53.680 --> 15:55.310
Robot!

15:58.280 --> 15:59.750
Now we're getting somewhere!

15:59.750 --> 16:04.290
Take them! Kill the rest!

16:04.660 --> 16:08.730
- [sheriff] kill them all!
- [crowd screaming]

16:10.060 --> 16:12.500
[screaming]

16:15.600 --> 16:17.000
- He surrenders!
- What?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.340
- Hai!
- [robin] you miserable cur!

16:19.340 --> 16:22.110
I had them on the run!
Flee! Lads, flee!

16:22.110 --> 16:24.980
- Live to fight another day!
- [all shouting]

16:24.980 --> 16:28.280
- To the dungeons...
With all of them!
- Ok.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.680
- What're you up to?
- Quickest way to find out
anybody's plans:

16:32.690 --> 16:35.320
Get yourself captured.

16:35.890 --> 16:40.460
[screams]

16:42.690 --> 16:46.200
[groaning]

16:48.470 --> 16:51.500
[woman sobbing]

16:51.500 --> 16:58.080
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you, lady.

17:01.610 --> 17:04.550
What are you?
Gargoyle, what are you?

17:04.550 --> 17:08.990
- [distorted voice] leave it.
- He only needs to rest.
We all need to rest.

17:08.990 --> 17:12.790
[distorted voice] analysis shows
that peasant creature is spent.

17:12.790 --> 17:18.329
- No! No, please!
- Usefulness expired.

17:18.329 --> 17:22.700
No... No! No!

17:27.069 --> 17:29.010
Damn you!

17:29.510 --> 17:33.080
Damn you and that villain
the sheriff!

17:33.080 --> 17:37.080
[sobbing]

17:39.250 --> 17:42.790
- Splendid! Enchained!
- Yup.

17:42.790 --> 17:47.020
Trussed up like turkey-cocks.
Thanks to your friend.

17:47.030 --> 17:50.830
Shut it, hoodie.
I saved your life.

17:50.830 --> 17:52.430
I had the situation
well in hand.

17:52.430 --> 17:55.030
Long-haired ninny versus
robot killer knights?

17:55.030 --> 17:58.740
- I know where
I'd put my money.
- If you had not betrayed me,

17:58.740 --> 17:59.900
I would have been triumphant.

17:59.910 --> 18:01.610
You would have been a
little puff of smoke and ashes!

18:01.610 --> 18:03.640
- Ha!
- You'd have
been floating around

18:03.640 --> 18:06.540
In tiny, little, laughing bits
in people's goblets!

18:06.550 --> 18:11.020
- Balderdash! Ha!
- Oh, right. Here we go,
it's laughing time.

18:11.020 --> 18:13.720
[laughs] well, you amuse me,
grey old man!

18:13.720 --> 18:15.850
- Guard! He's laughing again!
- Ha-ha-ha!

18:15.860 --> 18:18.490
You can't keep me locked up
with a laughing person!

18:18.490 --> 18:19.860
I find that...
I find that quite funny.

18:19.860 --> 18:21.660
Do you know,
I feel another laugh coming on?

18:21.660 --> 18:26.600
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Guards, I cannot remain
in this cell!

18:26.600 --> 18:29.330
- Execute me now!
- You heard him,
execute the old fool!

18:29.340 --> 18:32.370
- No, hang on, execute him!
- I do not fear death,
so execute away!

18:32.370 --> 18:37.040
Execute him! I'd like
to see if his head keeps
laughing when you chop it off!

18:37.040 --> 18:39.480
Robin hood always laughs
in the face of death!

18:39.480 --> 18:41.680
Yes, rolling around
the floor laughing!

18:41.680 --> 18:44.080
I would pay good money
to see that! Guard!

18:44.080 --> 18:46.650
- Guard! Guard!
- Guard! Guard!

18:46.650 --> 18:50.690
Will you two shut up?!

18:53.460 --> 18:54.990
[sighs]

18:54.990 --> 18:57.660
Do either of you understand,

18:57.660 --> 19:00.660
In any way at all,

19:00.670 --> 19:05.670
That there isn't actually
a guard out there?

19:08.470 --> 19:10.540
- Oh.
- I did, in fact.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.340
- No, you didn't.
- I said, shut up.

19:12.350 --> 19:16.580
The doctor and robin hood
locked up in a cell. Is this
seriously the best you can do?

19:16.580 --> 19:21.220
Are you determined to starve
to death in here, squabbling?

19:21.450 --> 19:23.190
Well, I'll tell you one thing:

19:23.190 --> 19:26.690
I'd last a lot longer than
this desiccated man-crone.

19:26.690 --> 19:27.460
[snorts]

19:27.460 --> 19:30.530
- Really?
- Really.

19:30.530 --> 19:32.660
Well, you know what?

19:32.670 --> 19:36.600
I think you'll find I have
a certain genetic advantage. Oh!

19:36.600 --> 19:40.270
It is not a competition
about who can die slower.

19:40.270 --> 19:42.040
It definitely would have been
me, though, wouldn't it?

19:42.040 --> 19:44.140
There was supposed
to be a plan.

19:44.140 --> 19:45.380
Do either of you two
have a plan?

19:45.380 --> 19:46.610
Yeah, of course I have a plan.

19:46.610 --> 19:48.680
- I too have a plan.
- Ok, robin, you first.

19:48.680 --> 19:54.490
- Why him?
- Doctor, shut up.
Robin, your plan?

19:55.920 --> 19:59.690
I am... Biding my time.

19:59.690 --> 20:05.530
Thank you, prince of thieves.
Last of the time lords?

20:05.530 --> 20:07.600
Yes, I have a plan.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.900
Can you explain your plan

20:08.900 --> 20:10.770
Without using the words
"sonic screwdriver"?

20:10.770 --> 20:12.870
Because you might
have forgotten,

20:12.870 --> 20:15.510
He sheriff of nottingham has
taken your screwdriver.
Just saying.

20:15.510 --> 20:19.680
- It's always the screwdriver.
- Right, ok, well, let's hear
robin's plan first.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.750
- For god's sake!
- [door opening]

20:21.750 --> 20:24.550
[robin] see? There was a guard.
There was guard listening

20:24.550 --> 20:29.190
The whole time, I knew it.
[laughs]

20:29.350 --> 20:32.120
The sheriff himself
commanded me to listen,

20:32.120 --> 20:34.690
To find out which of you
is the true ringleader.

20:34.690 --> 20:39.260
Ah, so he can do the
interrogating. Very wise.

20:39.270 --> 20:41.230
Excellent.
He will get nothing from me.

20:41.230 --> 20:42.830
No, no, no,
he will get nothing from me.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.470
Because interrogation,
that's when I always
turn the tables.

20:45.470 --> 20:49.440
- You see? That's my plan!
- Just hurry up
and take me to him.

20:49.440 --> 20:54.380
- No, no, chop, chop! Come on!
- [clara sighs]

20:54.380 --> 20:56.450
- Seriously?
- [guard] come on!

20:56.450 --> 20:58.220
- No!
- [robin] what are you doing?

20:58.220 --> 21:00.420
[the doctor]
don't be ridiculous!

21:00.420 --> 21:05.320
[door slams, locks]

21:06.660 --> 21:10.430
[men chattering indistinctly]

21:12.630 --> 21:16.530
'tis a thing of beauty indeed.

21:16.540 --> 21:19.440
And will feed a family for a
twelvemonth when melted down.

21:19.440 --> 21:23.510
Tonight we rest.
But tomorrow we must draw up
plans to rescue robin.

21:23.510 --> 21:28.850
We shall soon see how those
mechanicals feel about the
taste of nottingham steel!

21:28.850 --> 21:30.550
Lord forgive me.

21:30.550 --> 21:33.320
- Strange, though, is it not?
- What?

21:33.320 --> 21:36.020
All this looting
that the sheriff is doing.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.960
And yet, 'tis only
ever gold that he takes.

21:37.960 --> 21:43.560
Pearls, rubies, all the precious
jewels of the realm seem
no consequence to him.

21:43.560 --> 21:47.330
Only gold.

21:49.870 --> 21:52.400
<i>â™ª poor robin</i>
<i>and the stranger lay â™ª</i>

21:52.410 --> 21:54.670
<i>â™ª in the dungeon</i>
<i>all the live-long day â™ª</i>

21:54.670 --> 21:58.540
<i>â™ª the merry men</i>
<i>might pine away â™ª</i>

21:58.540 --> 22:00.740
<i>â™ª upon a sherwood morning</i>

22:00.750 --> 22:05.250
- [man grunting]
- [woman screaming]

22:24.470 --> 22:27.500
Eat, my lady, eat! Hm?

22:27.510 --> 22:31.210
Let it not be said that
the sheriff of nottingham
is a poor host.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.610
Had a bag of crisps
this morning, thanks.

22:33.610 --> 22:36.310
Your words are strange,
fair one.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.120
Hm, I should think they are.

22:38.120 --> 22:43.190
But I like you.
You are refreshingly... Direct.

22:43.190 --> 22:46.560
You can take the girl
out of blackpool.

22:48.790 --> 22:53.460
Taken from your friend's
strange tunic.

22:53.470 --> 22:56.830
An intriguing gallimaufry.

22:56.840 --> 23:01.140
Including this wand.

23:01.340 --> 23:06.280
Evidently a thing
of awesome power.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.310
Tell me,

23:08.310 --> 23:10.080
Are you from
beyond the stars?

23:10.080 --> 23:14.390
You're the one with
the robot army. You tell me.

23:15.590 --> 23:19.760
- I'm sorry?
- Moan! Beat your breast!

23:19.760 --> 23:22.660
Moan, groan as though 20
devils possessed your guts!

23:22.660 --> 23:25.260
- What for?
- So as to attract
the attention

23:25.260 --> 23:30.200
- Of that gargoyle-faced guard.
- It's your plan, you moan.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.470
No, no, no.
[laughs] it won't work.

23:32.470 --> 23:37.040
- Why?
- Because you are clearly
more advanced in years

23:37.040 --> 23:40.540
- And you have
a sickly aspect to you.
- I have a what?

23:40.550 --> 23:42.080
You're as pale as milk.

23:42.080 --> 23:45.050
It's the way with scots.
They're strangers to vegetables.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.180
I'm not moaning. You moan.

23:46.190 --> 23:49.790
Fine. If you want
something doing...

23:49.790 --> 23:51.890
[moans loudly]

23:51.890 --> 23:54.460
- Can I rely on you
to do the rest?
- Yes, yes, I know the drill.

23:54.460 --> 23:57.460
- [robin moaning]
- what is this din?

23:57.460 --> 23:59.560
No business of yours, cur!

23:59.570 --> 24:01.060
Speak up! I can't hear you.

24:01.070 --> 24:04.070
- What ails him?
- None of your business.

24:04.070 --> 24:07.170
- [robin moaning]
- I said, what ails him?

24:07.170 --> 24:09.970
Well, if you must know,
he's having a nervous breakdown.

24:09.980 --> 24:14.510
- [guard] a what?
- He's like this whenever
he's in any kind of danger.

24:14.510 --> 24:19.620
He just can't seem to cope,
he gets so afraid,
he goes into a kind of fit.

24:19.620 --> 24:23.050
I honestly believe that
he may die of sheer fright,

24:23.060 --> 24:25.560
Like some tiny,
shivering, little mouse.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.790
- [robin moans, clears throat]
- oh, god, I think
he's soiled himself.

24:27.790 --> 24:32.330
[guard] let him die.
It will save us the trouble
of executing him.

24:32.330 --> 24:33.830
And what will happen
to the reward?

24:33.830 --> 24:35.770
- [robin moaning]
- reward?

24:35.770 --> 24:38.900
[the doctor] oh, god,
I shouldn't have said that.

24:38.900 --> 24:40.100
Tell me!

24:40.110 --> 24:45.240
He carries a vital message.
The prince has promised
a bounty.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.610
- A big one?
- An enormous one.

24:47.610 --> 24:52.080
- What's that? Say again?
- [robin moaning]

24:52.080 --> 24:55.650
[muttering] come closer.
Come closer.

24:56.520 --> 25:00.260
You breath stinks
like a serpent.
Has anyone ever told you that?

25:00.260 --> 25:02.730
[grunts]

25:04.700 --> 25:06.100
- Soiled myself?
- Did you?

25:06.100 --> 25:09.530
That's getting into character.
Ok, keys!

25:09.540 --> 25:11.700
- I'll get them.
- No, no, I'll get them.

25:11.700 --> 25:12.900
- I'll get them!
- Doctor!

25:12.910 --> 25:14.610
- No, no, wait!
- Doctor!

25:14.610 --> 25:17.170
I'll get... Oh!

25:17.180 --> 25:19.910
[keys rattling]

25:19.910 --> 25:22.450
[water splashes]

25:22.450 --> 25:26.280
- Well, there is a bright side.
- Which is?

25:26.290 --> 25:28.690
Clara didn't see that.

25:28.690 --> 25:29.690
[sighs]

25:29.690 --> 25:35.790
But enough of tawdry matters.

25:36.390 --> 25:39.700
Let us talk of softer...

25:39.700 --> 25:41.330
...Sweeter things.

25:41.330 --> 25:45.270
Ah, good, yes, I was hoping
we'd get round to that.

25:45.270 --> 25:46.640
- You were?
- Mm.

25:46.640 --> 25:52.240
For I have known I was destined
to draw the eye of a great
and powerful man

25:52.240 --> 25:56.510
For a long time, ever since
I saw those mysterious
lights in the sky.

25:56.520 --> 26:03.450
- You saw them, too?
- And those strange mechanical
men, with their promises.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.990
- I too have experienced this.
- Really?

26:06.990 --> 26:09.160
Well, I would never have
guessed. Tell me your story.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.330
- Tell me yours.
- Oh, no, no, no.

26:11.330 --> 26:15.300
- But you have to go first.
- Why so?

26:16.170 --> 26:21.000
Because great men
always precede.

26:21.170 --> 26:25.280
- You have a point.
- Your story then.

26:25.280 --> 26:29.580
Once upon a time,
there was a brave

26:29.580 --> 26:32.650
And clever and handsome man.

26:32.650 --> 26:37.820
I can almost picture him.
I don't even have
to close my eyes.

26:37.820 --> 26:41.490
Unappreciated
by his royal master.

26:41.490 --> 26:43.930
- Prince john?
- The very same.

26:43.930 --> 26:49.800
Then came the lights
in the sky,
and everything changed.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.670
The skyship came to earth

26:52.670 --> 26:55.370
In a fury of fire.

26:55.370 --> 26:57.570
I'd almost call it a crash.
I remember it well.

26:57.580 --> 27:01.310
A craft from the heavenly
spheres, bedight
with twinkling lights

27:01.310 --> 27:03.680
And miracles beyond imagining!

27:03.680 --> 27:07.650
The most beautiful thing
the brave

27:07.650 --> 27:10.220
And handsome man
had ever seen.

27:10.220 --> 27:14.860
And I suppose the mechanical men
saw you as their natural leader.

27:14.860 --> 27:17.860
It was I, and I alone,

27:17.860 --> 27:21.770
To whom the mechanical men
within imparted their secrets.

27:21.770 --> 27:24.940
Shortly, I shall be the most
powerful man in the realm.

27:24.940 --> 27:30.810
King in all but name.
For nottingham is not enough.

27:30.810 --> 27:34.440
- It isn't?
- After this, derby.

27:34.450 --> 27:39.080
- Right.
- Then... Lincoln.

27:39.080 --> 27:42.720
- And after lincoln...
- Worksop?

27:43.550 --> 27:45.590
The world!

27:48.130 --> 27:50.090
[the doctor grunts, pants]

27:50.100 --> 27:53.400
- Now what?
- First a blacksmith's forge.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.030
So as to remove our chains?

27:55.030 --> 27:59.170
No, so I can knock up
an ornamental plant stand.

27:59.170 --> 28:01.370
Of course it's so we can
get rid of our chains.

28:01.370 --> 28:03.340
I don't want to be manacled
to you all night.

28:03.340 --> 28:05.810
- [laughs]
- oh, no, please, please,
don't do that.

28:05.810 --> 28:09.210
- "ornamental plant stand."
- it's not even that funny.

28:09.210 --> 28:10.510
You're an amusing fellow,
doctor!

28:10.520 --> 28:13.980
- Don't. Can you just stop!
- [robin laughing]

28:13.990 --> 28:15.420
[the doctor] you'll give
yourself a hernia.

28:15.420 --> 28:20.360
So, what are you hanging around
here for then, your majesty?

28:20.360 --> 28:24.560
Why are you bothering to squeeze
pips out of peasants if
you've got a skyship on standby?

28:24.560 --> 28:27.660
Enough questions.

28:27.670 --> 28:30.100
I am impatient
to hear your story.

28:30.100 --> 28:34.270
Oh, but I do not have one.

28:34.270 --> 28:36.410
- I was lying.
- Lying?

28:36.410 --> 28:39.180
Yeah. People are so much
better at sharing information

28:39.180 --> 28:42.610
If they think the other
person has already got it.

28:43.920 --> 28:48.250
- Oh, that's very clever.
- Thank you.

28:48.250 --> 28:52.920
- You'll do very well.
- For what?

28:52.930 --> 28:59.930
Doesn't every king...
Require a consort?

28:59.930 --> 29:00.600
Right.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.530
You do that again,

29:01.530 --> 29:03.630
And you'll regret that.

29:18.120 --> 29:23.250
[the doctor] at last,
something real.
No more fairy tales.

29:23.590 --> 29:28.160
- What is this place?
- A spaceship.
More 29th century than 12th.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.730
Databanks, databanks,
databanks.

29:30.730 --> 29:34.300
Where was this ship headed?

29:37.240 --> 29:39.740
The promised land again.

29:39.740 --> 29:41.400
Like the half-face man,
but more sophisticated.

29:41.410 --> 29:47.140
- [beeping]
- disguised itself
as a 12th century castle.

29:47.150 --> 29:49.480
It merges into the culture.

29:49.480 --> 29:53.750
Tries to keep a low profile
so no one notices.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.920
That explains
the robot knights.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.120
But the engines,
the engines are damaged.

29:59.120 --> 30:02.690
They're leaking radiation
into the local atmosphere

30:02.690 --> 30:06.400
Creating a temporary climate
of staggering benevolence.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.700
- I beg pardon?
- I told you.

30:08.700 --> 30:11.600
It's too sunny, it's too green.

30:11.600 --> 30:15.570
And there is even an evil
sheriff to oppress the locals.

30:15.570 --> 30:18.380
- This explains everything,
even you.
- It does?

30:18.380 --> 30:24.110
Well, what does every oppressed
peasant workforce need?
The illusion of hope.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.950
Some silly story
to get them through the day,

30:26.950 --> 30:30.490
Lull them into docility
and keep them working.

30:30.490 --> 30:31.690
Ship's databanks.

30:31.690 --> 30:34.930
Full of every myth
and legend you could hope for,

30:34.930 --> 30:38.090
Including... Robin hood.

30:38.100 --> 30:41.670
[beeping]

30:43.330 --> 30:47.400
Isn't it time
you came clean with me?

30:52.480 --> 30:54.280
You're not real,
and you know it.
Look at you.

30:54.280 --> 30:59.180
Perfect eyes, perfect teeth.
Nobody has a jaw line like that.

30:59.180 --> 31:01.650
You're as much a part of what
is happening here
as the sheriff

31:01.650 --> 31:04.150
And his metal knights.
You're a robot.

31:04.160 --> 31:09.590
You dare to accuse me
of collusion with that
villain the sheriff?

31:09.600 --> 31:12.100
- I dare!
- You false-tongued knave!

31:12.100 --> 31:15.500
I should have skewered you
when I had the chance!

31:15.500 --> 31:17.630
I would like
to see you try!

31:17.640 --> 31:21.400
[explosion]

31:22.470 --> 31:24.270
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.810
- Surrender, outlaw!
- Very good.

31:26.810 --> 31:28.250
Kill him. Kill robin hood!

31:28.250 --> 31:30.010
You can drop all that
stuff now, sheriff.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.820
- Doctor?
- He's not what you think he is.

31:31.820 --> 31:33.820
This is all play-acting.

31:33.820 --> 31:35.120
We can't just
let them kill him!

31:35.120 --> 31:37.650
[the doctor] you're not fooling
anyone, sheriff.

31:37.660 --> 31:40.420
[shouting]

31:42.990 --> 31:45.930
- What the hell are you doing?
- Surviving.

31:45.930 --> 31:48.700
- [clara screams] no!
- No! Clara!

31:48.700 --> 31:51.430
[water splashes]

31:58.240 --> 32:01.440
Yeah, sorry about the girl.
Such a pretty thing.

32:01.450 --> 32:05.350
What a queen
she would have made.

32:09.990 --> 32:12.120
[splashing]

32:18.400 --> 32:19.830
Stop pretending.

32:19.830 --> 32:21.830
You and your fancy robots.

32:21.830 --> 32:25.340
- I get it, I understand.
- Oh, so you too know my plans?

32:25.340 --> 32:31.370
You and your robots
plundering the surrounding
countryside for all its worth...

32:33.380 --> 32:36.110
Gold. Gold. Of course.

32:36.110 --> 32:41.480
Gold. You are creating
a matrix of gold to repair
the engine circuitry.

32:41.490 --> 32:44.090
This is the scheme
the mechanicals have devised.

32:44.090 --> 32:48.020
Soon this skyship will depart.
Destination: London.

32:48.030 --> 32:52.430
There, I will obliterate the
king and take my rightful place

32:52.430 --> 32:55.870
As ruler of this sceptreed isle.

32:55.870 --> 32:57.600
It won't work.
There's not a chance.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.000
I've seen the instruments.
There's been too much damage.

33:00.010 --> 33:02.570
You are stoking up
a gigantic bomb!

33:02.570 --> 33:03.870
[clicks tongue]

33:03.880 --> 33:05.080
[gasps]

33:05.080 --> 33:06.740
[loud clang]

33:07.080 --> 33:10.610
<i>[distorted voice]</i>
<i>engine capacity at 48 per cent.</i>

33:10.620 --> 33:12.620
[man shouting in distance]

33:12.620 --> 33:16.690
<i>Engine capacity</i>
<i>at 48 per cent.</i>

33:16.690 --> 33:18.020
It's not enough.

33:18.020 --> 33:20.720
That's not enough.
It'll never make orbit.

33:20.890 --> 33:22.330
[rumbling in distance]

33:22.330 --> 33:23.390
[grunts]

33:23.400 --> 33:27.400
That's the engines,
building up power.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.730
Stupid, stupid sheriff.

33:29.740 --> 33:31.740
[grunting]

33:31.740 --> 33:35.240
Stupid... Things.

33:35.240 --> 33:36.740
[pants]

33:37.480 --> 33:39.510
What are you looking at?

33:46.680 --> 33:51.320
- Hi.
- The time for games is over.

33:52.060 --> 33:53.360
[woman] I think
I understand you.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.690
The sheriff is using the gold
to replace something?

33:55.690 --> 33:58.660
That's the principle.
But he's a moron.

33:58.660 --> 34:04.530
If he tries to fly his ship,
it'll explode and wipe out
half the country.

34:04.870 --> 34:08.969
What we need
is a little riot.

34:08.969 --> 34:14.340
Time to reflect
on lasers and gold.
Spread the word.

34:14.350 --> 34:17.210
You will tell me everything
this doctor knows

34:17.219 --> 34:22.219
About robin hood
and his merry men.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.550
What is this?
Why are you interrogating me?

34:24.560 --> 34:29.590
And then you will tell me
exactly who this doctor is

34:29.590 --> 34:32.800
And what are his plans.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.870
[distorted voice]
you are fit for labour.

34:36.870 --> 34:40.000
Stand aside while this
peasant unit is freed.

34:40.010 --> 34:43.840
- I'm afraid you're
a little late.
- Explain.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.409
I'm already free!

34:53.949 --> 34:56.650
[grunting, panting]

35:04.460 --> 35:08.300
Mine, mine...

35:08.300 --> 35:09.100
...Mine!

35:18.510 --> 35:21.610
'sblood! Who will rid me

35:21.610 --> 35:24.150
Of this turbulent doctor?!

35:24.150 --> 35:29.020
- [metal clangs]
- ah! [groans] come.

35:29.020 --> 35:31.420
[man screams]

35:35.190 --> 35:37.530

35:37.960 --> 35:39.960
Ah!

35:39.970 --> 35:42.670
Everyone, the last one!

35:48.140 --> 35:50.370
[grunting]

35:53.240 --> 35:58.080
- [cheering]
- [the doctor] out! Out!
Everyone, quickly! Get out!

35:58.080 --> 36:01.020
- [people shouting]
- [the doctor] quickly!

36:01.020 --> 36:04.820
You've saved us all,
clever one. Thank you.

<i>[distorted voice]</i>
<i>engine capacity at 82 per cent.</i>

36:11.300 --> 36:15.700
You are indeed
an ingenious fellow, doctor.

36:15.700 --> 36:19.900
But do you really think your
peasants' revolt can stop me?

36:19.910 --> 36:22.940
I rather think you're the
revolting one around here.

36:22.940 --> 36:24.940
Bantering. I'm bantering!
Listen to me.

36:24.940 --> 36:27.180
You don't have enough
gold content

36:27.180 --> 36:29.780
To seal the engine breach.
If you try and take off,

36:29.780 --> 36:32.880
- You'll wipe out half
of England.
- Liar!

36:32.880 --> 36:35.420
From my sky-vessel,
I shall rule omnipotent.

36:35.420 --> 36:38.920
You pudding-headed primitive,
shut down the engines!

36:38.920 --> 36:42.230
What you're doing will alter
the course of history.

36:42.230 --> 36:44.060
I sincerely hope so.

36:44.060 --> 36:47.230
- [steam hissing]
- or I wouldn't be bothering.

36:47.230 --> 36:48.930
[mechanical whirring]

36:48.930 --> 36:51.970
Listen to me! It doesn't
have to end like this.
Shut it all down.

36:51.970 --> 36:53.940
Return clara to me
and I'll do what I can...

36:53.940 --> 36:56.870
- I don't have clara.
- Robin's one of yours!

36:56.880 --> 36:58.340
What did you say?

36:58.340 --> 37:01.980
He's one of your
tin-headed puppets,
just like these brutes here.

37:01.980 --> 37:07.020
- Robin hood is not one of mine.
- Of course he is, he's a robot!

37:07.020 --> 37:08.380
Created by your
mechanical mates.

37:08.390 --> 37:11.190
- Why would they do that?
- To pacify the locals.

37:11.190 --> 37:14.160
Give them false hope.
He's the opiate of the masses.

37:14.160 --> 37:16.830
Why would we create
an enemy to fight us?

37:16.830 --> 37:20.460
What sense would that make?
That would be a terrible idea.

37:20.470 --> 37:23.670
Yes. Yes, it would...

37:23.670 --> 37:26.440
[mumbles]
that'd be a rubbish idea.

37:26.440 --> 37:29.710
Why would you do that?
But he can't be.

37:29.710 --> 37:33.580
He's not real.
He's a legend!

37:33.580 --> 37:35.550
Too kind!

37:35.710 --> 37:39.780
And this legend
does not come alone!

37:39.780 --> 37:41.220
Hiya!

- Oh, yeah!

37:51.360 --> 37:53.560
Good. Hyah!

37:53.570 --> 37:54.960
- My men are taking the castle.
- No!

37:54.970 --> 37:58.640

- This one's all mine.

38:03.780 --> 38:06.080
Oh, yes.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.610
Ha!

38:08.050 --> 38:09.210
- Are you ok?
- Fine, yeah.

38:09.210 --> 38:11.550
- Good. We don't have long.
- [rumbling]

38:11.550 --> 38:14.320

38:14.650 --> 38:17.620
- I shall avenge
every slight, outlaw!
- Doctor...

38:17.620 --> 38:20.460
I know. The whole
castle's about to blow.

38:20.460 --> 38:23.830
You have long
been a thorn in my side!

38:23.830 --> 38:25.600
[grunting]

38:25.600 --> 38:29.300
Well, everyone should have
a hobby. Mine's annoying you.

38:29.300 --> 38:31.070
I'll have you boiled in oil
at the castle by sunset.

38:31.070 --> 38:35.440
Can we make it a little
earlier, 'cause that's
a little past my bedtime!

38:35.440 --> 38:38.510
[grunting]

38:41.780 --> 38:45.750
I'm too much for you, outlaw!

39:41.640 --> 39:43.110
Sorry, was that...

39:43.110 --> 39:45.610
- ...Was that showing off?
- That was amazing.

39:45.610 --> 39:48.640
[rumbling]

39:48.650 --> 39:51.580
Run! Come on, run!

39:56.950 --> 40:02.390
- [all shouting]
- [loud rumbling]

40:05.400 --> 40:09.370
It's never gonna make it.
Not enough gold!
It'll never make it into orbit!

40:09.370 --> 40:11.400
- Where is it? Where did it go?
- Where did what go?

40:11.400 --> 40:14.000
- The golden arrow!
- Tuck!

40:14.010 --> 40:15.410
- You took it?
- Of course we did.

40:15.410 --> 40:17.710
- We're robbers.
- I love you boys.

40:17.710 --> 40:19.610
[clara] doctor,
what are you suggesting?

40:19.610 --> 40:20.780
The golden arrow!

40:20.780 --> 40:23.410
It might just be enough
gold content to get the ship

40:23.420 --> 40:26.620
Into orbit and
out of harm's way.

40:26.620 --> 40:31.420
Well, it has to be you.
My arm is injured.

40:34.190 --> 40:36.830
You're good at this!
I saw you!
You won the tournament!

40:36.830 --> 40:40.130
I cheated. I made a special
arrow with a homing device.

40:40.130 --> 40:41.830
Oh, brilliant!
Right, let me have a go.

40:41.830 --> 40:44.500
You? You do taekwondo!
That's not the same thing
as this!

40:44.500 --> 40:48.670
My friends, surely we
can manage it together?

40:49.110 --> 40:50.140
Go this way.

40:50.140 --> 40:53.410
<i>[distorted voice]</i>
<i>engine capacity at 83 per cent.</i>

40:53.410 --> 40:58.050
Insufficient power
to achieve escape velocity.

41:06.260 --> 41:09.390
Maximum power surge.

41:10.590 --> 41:14.200
- [engines roaring]
- [laughs]

41:14.200 --> 41:17.700

41:17.700 --> 41:22.670
<i>Engines critical.</i>
<i>Engines...</i>

41:24.680 --> 41:28.140

41:34.090 --> 41:36.920
- Give it a rest, alan.
- [laughter]

41:36.920 --> 41:37.890
My lute!

41:37.890 --> 41:39.060
[men laughing]

41:39.060 --> 41:40.920
Still not keen
on the laughing thing?

41:40.930 --> 41:44.560
- No, not at all.
- [laughs]

41:45.600 --> 41:48.130
[chuckles]

41:49.100 --> 41:52.740
- Whoo-hoo!
- [laughs]

41:52.740 --> 41:56.870
- [sighs]
- I am gonna miss you.

41:56.880 --> 42:01.440
- [clara] you're very naughty.
- [robin] oh, I know.

42:02.810 --> 42:05.880
Whoever he is,

42:05.880 --> 42:08.520
He is a very lucky man.

42:08.520 --> 42:11.750
Marian is very lucky, too.

42:13.460 --> 42:17.430
- I fear not.
- Don't give up.

42:17.430 --> 42:21.730
Not ever,
not for one single day.

42:23.070 --> 42:25.300
Be safe, if you can be.

42:25.300 --> 42:28.240
But always be amazing.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.070
- Hm.
- [chuckles]

42:30.070 --> 42:32.580
[sighs]

42:32.580 --> 42:35.680
Goodbye, robin hood.

42:35.680 --> 42:40.450
Goodbye, clara oswald.

42:45.960 --> 42:48.460
[both laugh]

42:50.590 --> 42:56.130
- So, is it true, doctor?
- Is what true?

42:56.130 --> 43:02.200
That in the future I am
forgotten as a real man.
I am but a legend.

43:02.210 --> 43:06.510
- I'm afraid it is.
- Hm.

43:07.080 --> 43:10.850
Good. History is a burden.

43:10.850 --> 43:12.880
Stories can make us fly.

43:12.880 --> 43:16.320
I'm still having a little
trouble believing yours,
I'm afraid.

43:16.320 --> 43:17.390
Is it so hard to credit,

43:17.390 --> 43:20.060
That a man born
into wealth and privilege
should find the plight

43:20.060 --> 43:21.990
Of the oppressed and weak
too much to bear?

43:21.990 --> 43:27.100
- I know...
- Until one night he is moved
to steal a tardis...

43:27.530 --> 43:30.730
...Fly among the stars
fighting the good fight.

43:30.740 --> 43:33.170
Clara told me your stories.

43:33.170 --> 43:35.640
She should not have
told you any of that.

43:35.640 --> 43:39.580
Well... Well,
once the stories started,

43:39.580 --> 43:41.810
She could hardly
stop herself.

43:41.810 --> 43:45.680
- You are her hero, I think.
- I'm not a hero.

43:45.680 --> 43:48.520
Well, neither am I.

43:49.750 --> 43:52.960
But if we both keep
pretending to be...

43:52.960 --> 43:54.460
Ha-ha!

43:54.460 --> 43:58.190
...Perhaps others
will be heroes in our name.

43:58.200 --> 44:01.630
Perhaps we will
both be stories.

44:01.630 --> 44:06.200
And may those stories
never end.

44:09.910 --> 44:13.380
Goodbye, doctor,
time lord of gallifrey.

44:13.380 --> 44:17.950
Goodbye, robin hood,
earl of loxley.

44:17.950 --> 44:21.680
And remember, doctor,

44:21.690 --> 44:24.520
I'm just as real as you are.

44:34.730 --> 44:39.200
Admit it, you like him.

44:40.370 --> 44:43.570
We're leaving him
a present, aren't I?

44:47.840 --> 44:52.450
[tardis whirring]

44:57.050 --> 44:58.820
Robin?

44:58.820 --> 45:04.230
- I've found you at last.
- Marian! Marian!

45:04.960 --> 45:07.600
How are you...?

45:08.300 --> 45:09.230
- Oh!
- [men cheering]

45:09.230 --> 45:15.170
[laughs loudly]
thank you! Thank you, doctor!

45:16.970 --> 45:19.310
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

45:23.580 --> 45:27.080

<i>What's that footstep following,</i>
