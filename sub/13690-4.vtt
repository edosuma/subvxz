00:16.059 --> 00:17.228
Hello?

00:18.229 --> 00:20.565
Oh. Sorry, I...

00:20.648 --> 00:25.361
I was just driving down.
I stopped to admire the view.

00:25.445 --> 00:27.780
Ah, so you must have seen
the sign on the main road.

00:27.864 --> 00:31.826
-Sign?
-Glenbogle Bed and Breakfast.

00:31.909 --> 00:35.288
Bed and breakfast?
Times have changed round here.

00:35.371 --> 00:37.832
You'll be our first guest.
If you're looking
for a room, that is.

00:37.915 --> 00:40.209
Yes, yes, I am.

00:40.293 --> 00:41.794
Er, Harold Xavier.

00:41.878 --> 00:44.589
-Archie MacDonald.
-Archie.

00:44.672 --> 00:47.759
I run the place and if
there's anything you need
during your stay, just ask.

00:51.179 --> 00:52.805
I've put him in
the front room.

00:52.889 --> 00:55.683
It's a bit
draughty but at least
the ceiling's not falling in.

00:55.767 --> 00:57.602
-Is that dish hot?
-It's warm.

00:57.685 --> 01:00.021
Lexie, we're trying
to run a kitchen here,
not a burger van.

01:00.104 --> 01:02.148
Here.

01:02.231 --> 01:05.443
-They're al dente, yeah?
-Oh, yes. I boiled them
for 40 minutes exactly.

01:05.525 --> 01:08.738
-You what? Lexie...
-Look, shut up and take it in.

01:08.821 --> 01:10.406
Right. Right.

01:49.737 --> 01:51.030
Here we are.

01:54.659 --> 01:58.329
-So, are you up
here on business or...
-Research.

01:58.413 --> 02:00.206
This looks splendid.

02:01.581 --> 02:02.875
Everything okay
with your room?

02:02.959 --> 02:05.169
I hope that mattress
isn't too lumpy.

02:05.253 --> 02:09.590
No. No, everything's fine,
thank you. I couldn't open one
of the windows but...

02:09.674 --> 02:13.136
Really? Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:13.218 --> 02:15.680
-I'll see to it right away.
-Er, no, it's no bother.

02:15.763 --> 02:16.931
Duncan!

02:22.311 --> 02:25.231
The window in Mr
Xavier's room is jammed.
See to it, please.

02:26.107 --> 02:28.651
Aye, right. Of course.

02:28.735 --> 02:31.320
I don't want to put
you to any trouble.

02:31.403 --> 02:34.073
Please, it's no trouble.
You must treat this
place as your home.

02:34.157 --> 02:36.325
We try to keep things
informal around here.

02:36.409 --> 02:38.036
Thank you, thank you.
That's very...

02:38.119 --> 02:40.955
Where in heaven's name
did that woman put
my dressing gown?

02:41.789 --> 02:43.124
Father...

02:43.207 --> 02:45.752
What is this female obsession
for constant cleaning?

02:45.835 --> 02:47.378
Ah, hello there.

02:47.462 --> 02:49.589
-You can't walk
around like this.
-Like what?

02:49.672 --> 02:51.299
Wearing a tatty old towel.

02:51.382 --> 02:54.385
What?
Oh. I do beg your pardon.

02:54.469 --> 02:56.971
-That looks good.
Trout, isn't it?
-Yeah.

02:57.055 --> 02:59.724
Excellent. Well, I'll go
and put some clothes on, then.

03:03.811 --> 03:07.315
I... I see what you
mean about informal.

03:49.065 --> 03:52.694
-Stark naked?
-Apart from
a sprinkling of dandruff, yes.

03:52.777 --> 03:54.404
It's not funny, Mother.

03:54.487 --> 03:56.572
Well, maybe if you'd
just given him some notice.

03:56.656 --> 03:58.241
Who knows what he
could have managed?

03:58.324 --> 04:00.868
I know he dislikes this
bed and breakfast thing,

04:00.952 --> 04:03.496
but he doesn't have to streak
through the dining room.

04:03.579 --> 04:06.207
(HECTOR LAUGHING)

04:06.289 --> 04:11.212
HECTOR: Oh, MacPherson.
Our so-called butler.
Decamped in '73.

04:11.295 --> 04:13.423
Wouldn't have
minded but he ran off
with all the cutlery.

04:13.506 --> 04:15.925
We were eating with
our fingers for weeks.

04:16.009 --> 04:18.678
XAVIER: And what about
your house-keeper Miriam?

04:20.096 --> 04:21.514
Oh.

04:21.596 --> 04:24.517
Molly. You remember Harold.

04:25.101 --> 04:27.395
Oh, Mr Xavier.

04:27.477 --> 04:29.480
I thought you'd
gone to America.

04:29.563 --> 04:31.691
Oh, just a flying visit.

04:31.774 --> 04:33.943
25 years or so.

04:34.027 --> 04:36.446
You haven't aged a day,
Mrs MacDonald.

04:36.529 --> 04:39.157
Didn't recognise him earlier.
Had a beard in those days.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.950
Yeah,
and you wore more clothes.

04:41.034 --> 04:44.829
And young Archie
has certainly changed.

04:44.912 --> 04:48.291
Mr Xavier came here years ago
to study the estate records.

04:48.374 --> 04:51.085
-He's a genealogist.
-Watch this, watch this.

04:52.295 --> 04:55.131
-Farquharson.
-Farquharson.

04:55.214 --> 04:58.468
Farquharson of Invercauld,
Finlay Mor,
standard bearer,

04:58.551 --> 05:01.095
fell at
the Battle of Pinkie, 1547.

05:01.179 --> 05:05.183
Francis, the Baron Ban,
led the clan at Culloden,
1746.

05:05.266 --> 05:07.518
On the death of his grandson,
James Farquharson,

05:07.602 --> 05:09.354
the title passed
to his daughter Catherine,

05:09.437 --> 05:13.858
who married James Ross
of Balnagowan, 1820.

05:15.068 --> 05:16.527
Isn't that amazing?

05:16.611 --> 05:20.114
Keep him topped up with malt,
he'll carry on indefinitely.

05:20.198 --> 05:22.658
So, what brings you
back to Glenbogle?

05:22.742 --> 05:27.330
I've been asked to trace
the descendants of
a particular clan.

05:27.413 --> 05:30.249
I was hoping to have
a look at some records,
if that's convenient.

05:30.333 --> 05:31.918
'Course it's convenient.

05:32.001 --> 05:34.003
They're
conveniently in the attic.

05:34.087 --> 05:36.506
We'll get them down for you.
Not busy, are you, Archie?

05:42.720 --> 05:45.890
Doesn't
genealogical research include
doing your own excavations?

05:45.973 --> 05:47.100
Nonsense.

05:47.183 --> 05:48.893
We're running a guesthouse,
Archie.

05:48.976 --> 05:50.895
Can't have the guests
doing their backs in.

05:54.107 --> 05:56.192
Marvellous. Marvellous.

05:56.275 --> 05:59.278
Records for every
local family since 1770.

05:59.362 --> 06:02.031
-Who was Miriam MacKinnon?
-Miriam?

06:02.114 --> 06:05.493
Our housekeeper, 20 years ago.
Best one we ever had.

06:05.576 --> 06:07.870
This case has got her name
on it. Shouldn't we
send it on to her?

06:07.954 --> 06:10.498
Tricky. She passed
away a few years ago.

06:10.581 --> 06:13.334
-Perhaps you should
give it to her daughter.
-Who's her daughter?

06:13.418 --> 06:16.629
What's her name? Firebrand.
Lives up in the hills.

06:16.713 --> 06:17.839
Katrina?

06:19.132 --> 06:20.675
KATRINA:
Won't Party Headquarters
be sending out

06:20.758 --> 06:23.219
a search team for you soon?

06:23.302 --> 06:26.055
I thought I might
write my report up here.

06:26.139 --> 06:27.515
Did you?

06:27.598 --> 06:30.893
Katrina, I know you're
cheesed off about the ball.

06:30.977 --> 06:33.354
Because you drove
a flock of sheep
through the dance floor?

06:33.438 --> 06:34.856
Why would that bother me?

06:34.939 --> 06:37.775
Look, if it got you into
trouble with the laird,
I'm sorry.

06:37.859 --> 06:40.153
I really didn't mean
to mess up your life.

06:40.236 --> 06:42.613
You never do,
and you always have.

06:44.323 --> 06:45.742
Look, I miss you.

06:46.950 --> 06:48.870
I miss the scent of you.

06:48.953 --> 06:53.041
I just can't bear
the thought of you
up here on your own.

06:53.124 --> 06:55.501
Why, because without a man,
my life has no purpose?

06:55.585 --> 06:57.003
Oh, not just any man.

06:59.756 --> 07:01.758
I'd better be getting back.

07:01.841 --> 07:04.969
The kids will think
I've bunked off
for the afternoon.

07:05.053 --> 07:06.762
I'll run you down there.

07:06.846 --> 07:08.389
I'm fine.

07:08.473 --> 07:10.600
If you get bored,
there's the washing-up.

07:13.644 --> 07:15.271
(DOOR SLAMMING)

07:25.239 --> 07:27.575
DUNCAN:
There's more to your man
than meets the eye.

07:27.658 --> 07:30.036
Wish I could say
the same for you.

07:30.119 --> 07:34.040
That's no way to
speak to a duke, Lexie.

07:34.123 --> 07:36.709
Have you been out in
the sun again, pet?

07:36.793 --> 07:40.922
That man Xavier,
he's looking for an heir
to the Ballantine estate.

07:41.005 --> 07:43.007
I saw his papers upstairs.

07:43.091 --> 07:46.094
And you just accidentally
happened to read them?

07:46.177 --> 07:49.347
I asked you to fix
his window, Duncan,
not turn his room over.

07:49.430 --> 07:52.100
I couldn't help it.
I saw the name. Ballantine.

07:53.309 --> 07:55.269
That's my granny's name.

07:55.353 --> 07:58.856
Oh, so that makes you
Duke of the Highlands,
I suppose.

07:58.940 --> 08:02.068
Maybe. Eventually.

08:02.151 --> 08:03.903
Well, before you head off
to the palace,

08:03.986 --> 08:06.239
could I have the keys
to the Land Rover, please?

08:06.322 --> 08:07.907
Oh,
they're in his other cloak.

08:07.990 --> 08:09.784
The one with
the ermine collar.

08:12.245 --> 08:15.123
-She needs new plugs
but you should be okay.
-Cheers.

08:15.206 --> 08:18.543
I suppose from now on
you'll be
travelling in a sedan chair,

08:18.626 --> 08:21.379
borne by comely and
compliant maidens.

08:21.462 --> 08:23.464
You volunteering?

08:23.548 --> 08:26.092
You need to lose some
weight first. Starting off
with that fat heid.

08:26.926 --> 08:28.886
Oh, go ahead. Mock.

08:28.970 --> 08:31.806
Don't worry, I will.

08:31.889 --> 08:33.558
MAN: I've got every
right to them kids.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.144
-MAN 2: You've nae
right to this at all.
-Of course I have.

08:36.227 --> 08:38.395
You're a scabby old swindler.

08:38.479 --> 08:40.773
You're the thief.
Ripping off my ideas.

08:40.857 --> 08:43.234
Archie.
Mr Pearce, Mr Johnston.

08:43.317 --> 08:45.028
We're here to see Hector.

08:45.111 --> 08:46.946
I'm in charge now.
What's the problem?

08:47.030 --> 08:48.740
His goat raped my stock.

08:48.823 --> 08:50.950
-He's trying to
cheat me out of my kids.
-Thieving beggar.

08:51.032 --> 08:53.036
-Right, one at a time.
-I keep goats.

08:53.118 --> 08:55.496
There's nae money in
mutton or wool these days.

08:55.580 --> 08:58.499
So my idea was to
try goats' milk.

08:58.583 --> 09:01.002
-Your idea?
-Aye, and you ripped it off!

09:01.084 --> 09:02.295
Gentlemen.

09:02.377 --> 09:05.465
So Mr Original here
buys hisself a billy

09:05.548 --> 09:08.051
and last autumn he
lets it loose in my field.

09:08.134 --> 09:10.803
-It escaped.
-Covered six of my ewes.

09:10.887 --> 09:13.139
And now he wants the kids.

09:13.222 --> 09:17.352
So his goat ran off
and sired six
kids in your flock?

09:17.435 --> 09:18.811
Aye,
and half of them are mine.

09:18.895 --> 09:21.230
-Over my dead body!
-Suits me.

09:21.314 --> 09:24.817
-This is ludicrous.
Just take it to court.
-To court?

09:24.901 --> 09:27.528
Aye, and get fleeced
by a bunch of lawyers?
I don't think so.

09:27.612 --> 09:31.741
We're here for
the judgement of the laird.
It's our ancient right.

09:31.824 --> 09:34.535
I may be the laird,
but I know nothing
about goat farming

09:34.619 --> 09:35.870
and I don't intend to learn.

09:35.953 --> 09:38.414
Now, please,
just take this
dispute somewhere else.

09:39.290 --> 09:40.500
Somewhere else?

09:47.006 --> 09:49.342
-Well,
what was I supposed to do?
-Who knows?

09:49.425 --> 09:51.803
Those two have always
fought like rats in a sack.

09:53.262 --> 09:55.932
You think I'm
shirking my responsibilities.

09:56.015 --> 09:58.309
You won't get rid
of them that easily.

10:29.757 --> 10:31.676
I'm sorry, you're in my light.

10:32.593 --> 10:35.138
Oh, right. Beg pardon.

10:42.186 --> 10:44.355
Can I help you with something?

10:46.774 --> 10:50.695
It's just that my
name's Ballantine.

10:50.778 --> 10:52.822
My granny's is, I mean, was.

10:53.406 --> 10:54.449
Really?

10:55.324 --> 10:57.493
Jenny Ballantine.

10:57.577 --> 10:59.328
She won't be in that book.

10:59.412 --> 11:03.541
And why should that
be of any significance?

11:03.624 --> 11:07.420
Well, I glimpsed
your papers upstairs,
about the legacy.

11:07.503 --> 11:10.673
My research is
supposed to be confidential.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.426
Oh, no, there's no need
to worry about that.
My lips are sealed.

11:13.509 --> 11:15.053
It's just that...

11:15.136 --> 11:16.971
I thought I could save
you some trouble.

11:17.055 --> 11:19.390
I could get
her birth certificate.
My gran's.

11:19.474 --> 11:22.852
By itself,
that wouldn't prove anything.

11:22.935 --> 11:27.231
-No, honest,
she was definitely my granny.
-No, no.

11:27.315 --> 11:30.568
It's just that with
a bequest of this nature,

11:30.651 --> 11:34.489
I would have to correlate
it with other records.

11:34.572 --> 11:36.366
Ah, I see.

11:36.449 --> 11:39.118
Right. Uh...

11:40.578 --> 11:43.873
What sort of
bequest is it exactly?

11:47.960 --> 11:49.420
Where was she from?

11:51.047 --> 11:52.507
Your granny.

11:53.049 --> 11:54.092
Paisley.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.470
Inverness originally.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.348
Go on.

12:07.897 --> 12:10.817
Hi. Oh.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.736
-I was looking for Katrina.
-She's still at work.

12:14.862 --> 12:16.781
Were you planning to move in?

12:16.864 --> 12:19.283
-It's for her, actually.
-Well,
you can leave it with me.

12:19.367 --> 12:21.828
I'd rather give it to her
myself if you don't mind.

12:22.912 --> 12:24.956
Then you'd better come in.

12:29.419 --> 12:31.087
I thought you'd
gone back to Edinburgh.

12:31.170 --> 12:34.257
I meant to but the poor girl's
desperate for
intelligent company.

12:34.340 --> 12:37.260
Yeah, she must be.

12:37.343 --> 12:40.388
Must be pretty cramped in here
with the two of you.

12:40.471 --> 12:42.682
It is pretty cosy, yes.

12:42.765 --> 12:44.350
But we're used to it.

12:44.434 --> 12:46.728
Can't all live in
a 20-bedroom mansion.

12:46.811 --> 12:48.646
Oh, they're a bit overrated.

12:48.730 --> 12:50.440
Yes, I know.

12:52.025 --> 12:53.651
Lugging your own suitcase.

12:53.735 --> 12:56.487
Well, I suppose you can't
get the staff these days.

12:56.571 --> 12:59.323
I just flogged my valet.
I can't do a thing with him.

13:01.117 --> 13:02.994
-Hello.
-Hi.

13:03.077 --> 13:04.370
Hello, love.

13:06.831 --> 13:08.750
Who's going to
put the kettle on?

13:10.960 --> 13:12.545
I will.

13:12.628 --> 13:17.467
I doubt the laird knows
his way around a kitchen.

13:17.550 --> 13:20.678
We found this in the attic.
I think it
belonged to your mother.

13:24.265 --> 13:26.392
That's her handwriting.

13:26.476 --> 13:28.394
I don't know how it
ended up in Glenbogle.

13:28.478 --> 13:31.606
It'll have to be mugs,
I'm afraid.
We're out of Wedgwood.

13:31.689 --> 13:33.524
Not for me,
thanks, I'm not stopping.

13:33.608 --> 13:35.735
Fine. It's more for us.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.489
Archie, don't mind him.

13:39.572 --> 13:41.491
What's to mind? See you.

13:48.164 --> 13:50.375
Does the laird
disapprove of cohabitation?

13:50.458 --> 13:52.669
Who said anything
about cohabitation?

13:52.752 --> 13:54.837
Well, he might have jumped
to the wrong conclusions.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.507
Did he jump or was he pushed?

13:57.590 --> 14:01.678
Och, yes.
Yes, his granny was
a Ballantine all right.

14:01.761 --> 14:03.763
Her first husband
was killed at Dunkirk

14:03.846 --> 14:06.057
just a few weeks
after the wedding.

14:06.140 --> 14:09.769
Married again in '42.
Alex McKay was his name.

14:09.852 --> 14:11.479
A cousin of my
father's actually.

14:11.562 --> 14:15.149
-You mean we're related?
-Around here,
everyone's related, son.

14:15.233 --> 14:17.443
But it's not
something to boast about,
if you know what I mean.

14:17.527 --> 14:19.028
This is splendid.

14:19.112 --> 14:21.114
Anything else you need to
know, just say the word.

14:21.197 --> 14:24.367
No, thank you.
No, no, this is
plenty to be going on with,

14:24.450 --> 14:28.371
but I think
I need another look
at the baptismal records.

14:28.454 --> 14:29.997
Anyway, thanks again.

14:32.917 --> 14:35.962
I won't forget this...
when I come into
my inheritance.

14:36.045 --> 14:38.297
Ach, I think you need
to wait to be crowned first

14:38.381 --> 14:40.883
before you start dispensing
knighthoods, huh?

14:56.441 --> 14:58.276
ALAN: July 1972.

15:01.279 --> 15:05.658
They couldn't even have
a picnic without staff waiting
on them hand and foot.

15:08.119 --> 15:09.620
Was pretty, your mum.

15:11.414 --> 15:13.541
Where's your father?

15:13.624 --> 15:16.794
My father didn't
work on the estate.

15:16.878 --> 15:18.755
My mother married
him after she left.

15:20.715 --> 15:23.634
-She kept a diary.
-Alan, leave it, please.

15:23.718 --> 15:29.015
What shabby little scandals
went on below the stairs?

15:29.098 --> 15:32.143
"Saw 'H' today
for the last time
up at the Big House.

15:32.226 --> 15:34.354
"Tried to tell him I
was carrying his...

15:35.646 --> 15:37.440
"But Molly came in."

15:40.526 --> 15:42.153
Good grief, Katrina.

15:44.113 --> 15:47.241
My mother had an affair
while she was
working at Glenbogle.

15:49.118 --> 15:52.789
She became pregnant
with me and then left.

15:54.957 --> 15:57.210
And then she
married my father.

15:57.293 --> 15:58.503
My dad.

15:59.504 --> 16:02.590
"'H' at the big house."
Who's 'H'?

16:02.674 --> 16:04.425
Who do you think?

16:04.509 --> 16:07.679
Now, this is
the interesting bit, you see.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.060
Now where did I put it?

16:14.143 --> 16:16.020
I don't know how you
find anything in this mess.

16:16.104 --> 16:18.981
By using
a cunning filing system
of my own invention.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.400
Don't tell me,
it's all up here.

16:20.483 --> 16:23.569
Ah, no, no. Nothing so
old-fashioned, my boy.

16:23.653 --> 16:27.240
All filed in order of
amount of dust gathered.
Now...

16:27.323 --> 16:30.493
Yes, this is it.
This is what
I wanted to show Xavier.

16:30.576 --> 16:32.495
The Glenbogle MacDonalds.

16:32.578 --> 16:35.957
They're all here,
from the infamous Red Fergus
right down to the present day.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.250
Excuse me.

16:38.668 --> 16:41.004
I think there might
be one name missing.

16:51.389 --> 16:53.182
Remarkable.

16:53.266 --> 16:55.685
I had no idea your
mother kept a journal.

16:55.768 --> 17:00.023
Well, it wasn't her
writing skills that struck me.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.775
I always wondered why
she left so abruptly.

17:02.859 --> 17:04.777
I suppose that explains it.

17:04.861 --> 17:06.904
-Hector...
-If you'll excuse me.

17:10.074 --> 17:13.286
Welcome.
Welcome to the family, dear.

17:13.368 --> 17:17.373
We must all celebrate.
Excuse me.

17:17.457 --> 17:20.084
Mother, wait. I'm sure
there's an explanation.

17:20.167 --> 17:23.421
I'm sure there is,
but I don't think
I want to hear it.

17:31.888 --> 17:33.473
Look, I'm sorry.

17:33.556 --> 17:35.433
To have a black
sheep in the family?

17:35.516 --> 17:38.019
Well, Hector's
the black sheep, not me.

17:38.102 --> 17:39.896
You've got every
right to be angry.

17:39.979 --> 17:42.231
I haven't even
got to angry yet.

17:42.315 --> 17:43.566
I'm still in shock.

17:44.858 --> 17:48.529
-You realise what this means?
-Yeah.

17:48.613 --> 17:50.698
That my parents
lied to me all my life.

17:51.908 --> 17:53.200
You've got a brother.

17:55.285 --> 17:57.121
Great.

17:57.205 --> 17:58.663
Just what I needed.

18:00.249 --> 18:01.792
And I've got another sister.

18:01.876 --> 18:03.835
-And that
bothers you, does it?
-Yes.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.755
Well, no, I mean...

18:05.838 --> 18:08.216
It was bad enough
being an orphan,

18:08.298 --> 18:10.843
but I'd rather be an orphan
than the daughter of a laird.

18:12.929 --> 18:16.140
I shouldn't be doing this.
A man of my position.

18:16.224 --> 18:19.435
Listen,
son, Archie's the laird.
He scrubs out the toilets.

18:19.519 --> 18:21.521
Aye, but Archie's skint.

18:21.604 --> 18:24.023
Ach,
of course, I was forgetting,
you're heir to a fortune.

18:24.107 --> 18:26.609
Well, why do you think
your man's being so secretive?

18:26.693 --> 18:30.488
I'll have gold-diggers
and debutantes and all
sorts chasing after me.

18:30.571 --> 18:33.533
-A terrifying
prospect all right.
-Aye.

18:33.616 --> 18:37.412
The thing is,
I'd rather have a girl
who loved me for myself.

18:37.495 --> 18:40.123
Well,
there's a big lunatic asylum
just outside Fort William.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.125
I was thinking
somewhere closer to home.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.960
Like the Big House, you mean?

18:45.962 --> 18:47.714
Only I'm a bit skint.

18:47.797 --> 18:49.173
Pending the settlement.

18:50.174 --> 18:51.300
Duncan.

18:53.678 --> 18:57.473
A man in
possession of a fortune
must be in want of a wife.

18:58.891 --> 19:01.519
Thanks. You'll get it back.

19:01.602 --> 19:03.396
Oh, first rule of nobility...

19:03.479 --> 19:05.231
never pay your debts.

19:08.568 --> 19:10.695
Look on the bright side.

19:10.778 --> 19:13.322
At least you didn't
inherit their looks.

19:13.406 --> 19:19.078
-Do you think this is funny?
-Of course not. I'm just
trying to cheer you up.

19:19.162 --> 19:21.539
I think maybe you
should go back to Edinburgh.

19:21.622 --> 19:24.292
-Oh,
you need a friend right now.
-Aye, I do.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.919
Someone to give
you objective advice.

19:28.671 --> 19:32.133
-Well, what do you advise?
-Look...

19:32.216 --> 19:34.135
you're entitled
to certain things.

19:34.218 --> 19:35.762
Public
acknowledgement for one.

19:35.845 --> 19:38.306
Do you think I want
everyone to know about this?

19:38.389 --> 19:42.060
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but won't it be all
over the village by now?

19:42.143 --> 19:43.478
That's it, I'm moving out.

19:43.561 --> 19:45.688
You're not
running away from this.

19:45.772 --> 19:48.983
Look, that family
treated your mother like dirt.

19:49.067 --> 19:51.110
Now's your chance
to make them pay.

19:54.864 --> 19:56.991
A simple "yes"
or "no", Hector.

19:57.075 --> 19:58.993
Even you could manage that.

19:59.077 --> 20:01.662
Good God, it was 25 years ago.

20:01.746 --> 20:05.291
I know it's terribly vulgar
of me to care if my husband
sleeps with the staff,

20:05.375 --> 20:08.670
but for some
absurd reason, I do.

20:08.753 --> 20:11.339
So,
how many others were there?

20:11.422 --> 20:13.591
Or does a gentleman
not like to boast?

20:13.675 --> 20:15.093
I'm not having
this discussion.

20:15.176 --> 20:17.178
We are having
this discussion.

20:17.261 --> 20:18.971
There is nothing to discuss.

20:19.055 --> 20:21.891
What a man does or doesn't do
in his own house
is his own business.

20:21.974 --> 20:23.851
I mean, if you want to
torture yourself, go ahead.

20:23.935 --> 20:26.854
I have no intention
of torturing myself,
that's always been your job.

20:26.938 --> 20:28.314
And you excel at it.

20:33.027 --> 20:35.029
(BELL RINGING)

20:40.868 --> 20:44.205
You see this? You see it?
It's attempted murder.

20:44.288 --> 20:46.290
Well, try it again
and you can have
the other barrel,

20:46.374 --> 20:47.959
you thieving beggar.

20:48.042 --> 20:51.921
Enough. That's enough.
I told you to take
this somewhere else.

20:52.005 --> 20:55.299
You call that justice?
You call yourself a laird?

20:55.383 --> 20:57.927
Ah, you're nae son
of Hector MacDonald.

20:58.011 --> 21:00.972
Right, that's it. You
want me to intervene, I will.

21:01.055 --> 21:04.058
Those goats are
hereby wards of the laird.

21:04.142 --> 21:05.476
What?

21:05.560 --> 21:07.520
You don't try to seize them

21:07.603 --> 21:10.481
and you don't try to dispose
of them without reference
to me. Satisfied?

21:10.565 --> 21:13.109
Well,
how long does that go on for?

21:13.192 --> 21:16.904
Until I say otherwise
or until you sort it out
between yourselves. Goodbye.

21:27.790 --> 21:29.083
Where are you going?

21:29.167 --> 21:32.337
-I'm going to stay
with friends in London.
-Mother.

21:32.420 --> 21:35.089
I am not just
an appendage to your father.

21:35.173 --> 21:36.591
I never thought you were.

21:36.674 --> 21:38.801
Neither did I...till today.

22:09.791 --> 22:11.584
Do you realise
that's 300 years old?

22:11.668 --> 22:15.254
-Oh,
sorry, Archie, I was just...
-Practising, yeah.

22:15.338 --> 22:17.590
You'll find it a bit different
from modern nobility.

22:17.674 --> 22:19.967
Here. Chin down.

22:20.051 --> 22:23.179
Not so square in
the shoulders. Frown.

22:23.971 --> 22:25.264
Yeah, that's it.

22:25.348 --> 22:27.058
All you need now
is the chronic overdraft,

22:27.141 --> 22:29.102
the divorced parents
and you're there.

22:41.155 --> 22:42.907
I suppose it's
your friend Geordie.

22:42.990 --> 22:45.076
-I beg your pardon?
-That you're running off to.

22:45.159 --> 22:46.994
You've got
a bloody nerve, MacDonald.

22:47.078 --> 22:48.663
This business was so long ago.

22:48.746 --> 22:50.665
We are not discussing
vintage port.

22:50.748 --> 22:54.043
-Lies don't improve with age.
-I've never lied to you.

22:54.127 --> 22:56.045
Damn it,
I'm not that woman's father.

22:56.129 --> 22:58.172
I've no idea what those
journals were referring to.

22:58.256 --> 23:00.299
MacKinnon was
probably deranged.

23:00.383 --> 23:02.885
Thank you, Hector.

23:02.969 --> 23:05.638
And now let's hope
that's the end of the matter.

23:05.722 --> 23:07.724
But... Where are you going?

23:07.807 --> 23:09.559
Too little, too late.

23:11.561 --> 23:12.687
Too...

23:17.025 --> 23:19.694
What more do you want
from me, stupid woman?

23:27.243 --> 23:30.371
-Is everything all right?
-It's fine.

23:30.455 --> 23:34.083
I hope I haven't been
the cause of any discord.

23:34.167 --> 23:36.169
Oh, no, no, no. Please,
it's nothing to do with you.

23:36.252 --> 23:39.547
Just a... Just a bit
of local genealogy.

23:39.630 --> 23:44.260
Well, it's not always
a dry academic exercise.

23:45.762 --> 23:47.096
Unfortunately.

24:02.653 --> 24:04.906
It's good of you to see
us at such short notice.

24:04.989 --> 24:07.158
Katrina is a neighbour.
She's always welcome.

24:07.241 --> 24:10.244
She's a bit more than
a neighbour now, isn't she?

24:11.412 --> 24:12.955
Please, come through.

24:19.796 --> 24:22.382
Katrina has arranged to
get a blood sample taken.

24:22.465 --> 24:25.551
She was hoping Hector
might provide one as well.

24:25.635 --> 24:27.053
I'm sorry,
I really don't think that...

24:27.136 --> 24:29.597
It's as much
for your benefit as ours.

24:29.681 --> 24:31.265
Ours?

24:31.349 --> 24:34.727
-I'd just like to
know for sure, Archie.
-So would I.

24:34.811 --> 24:37.188
But I'm not gonna
ask him right now,
he's too upset.

24:37.271 --> 24:41.317
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
but his troubles
are of his own making.

24:41.401 --> 24:44.612
Alan,
I know you're trying to help,
but it's not working.

24:44.696 --> 24:47.448
We really don't want to
go to court over this.

24:47.532 --> 24:51.494
You are not getting
a blood sample from my father,
it's out of the question.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.914
-Fine.
-I'll give you one.

24:57.041 --> 25:00.003
Well,
if I'm Katrina's brother,
the tests should prove it.

25:01.295 --> 25:02.505
They might.

25:03.339 --> 25:04.549
I'll look into it.

25:05.967 --> 25:07.719
Alan,
could you give us a minute?

25:07.802 --> 25:10.221
-I don't think you should...
-Thanks, Alan.

25:16.686 --> 25:18.229
(DOOR CLOSING)

25:18.312 --> 25:21.357
Well,
I suppose if you want blood,
you need a leech.

25:21.441 --> 25:25.820
I'm sorry, but he's got
a point. We need to know.

25:25.903 --> 25:29.157
Katrina, if you wanna
be part of this family,
nobody's gonna fight about it.

25:30.408 --> 25:32.869
Maybe I'll see you
at the doctor's. Okay?

25:44.922 --> 25:46.924
I thought you'd gone
to the House of Lords.

25:47.008 --> 25:49.302
Been down at my folks'
place looking for this.

25:49.385 --> 25:51.095
Granny's birth certificate.

25:51.179 --> 25:53.389
Proving my claim to the title.

25:53.473 --> 25:56.893
-All I need now
is a coat of arms.
-And what'll that be?

25:56.976 --> 25:59.395
Crossed wellies in
a field of neeps?

25:59.479 --> 26:02.023
You do realise you'll
have to curtsey to me
every morning?

26:02.106 --> 26:05.777
-Says who?
-It's etiquette.

26:05.860 --> 26:09.364
Could settle for a small bow,
but you'd still
have to call me "sir".

26:09.447 --> 26:10.865
In your dreams, boy.

26:13.159 --> 26:15.912
Of course,
if we were man and wife,
you could just call me Duncan.

26:15.995 --> 26:18.247
No, I think "sir"
has a nice ring to it.

26:19.499 --> 26:21.584
I've got something for you.

26:21.668 --> 26:23.044
What's this?

26:23.127 --> 26:25.505
The Ballantine family jewels?

26:25.588 --> 26:27.715
Used to belong
to a millionaire.

26:27.799 --> 26:29.133
Gerald Ratner.

26:30.718 --> 26:33.971
-Duncan.
-Will you be my duchess,
Lexie?

26:35.139 --> 26:36.766
Duncan, I can't.

26:37.809 --> 26:38.976
Why not?

26:39.894 --> 26:42.438
Well, the thing is, um...

26:42.522 --> 26:46.109
Well, you being a duke
and me being a housekeeper,

26:46.192 --> 26:47.735
well, it just wouldn't work.

26:48.653 --> 26:50.238
Well, look at Hector...

26:50.321 --> 26:53.199
-But... Well, but you'd...
-Holy...

27:02.166 --> 27:03.376
Archie!

27:04.794 --> 27:06.671
DUNCAN: Come here!

27:12.719 --> 27:14.846
Oh, for heaven's sake.

27:17.557 --> 27:19.684
LEXIE: Shut the gate, Archie.

27:25.815 --> 27:28.151
What the hell are you doing
dumping those animals here?

27:28.234 --> 27:33.031
Apparently, they're
the wards of the laird.
You call yourself the laird.

27:33.114 --> 27:34.782
You can feed them.

27:34.866 --> 27:36.909
They're destroying our garden.

27:37.577 --> 27:38.911
Mr Johnston.

27:46.919 --> 27:48.129
Lexie, this one.

27:49.630 --> 27:52.842
LEXIE: Duncan.
DUNCAN: Lexie, got...
Over there!

28:02.685 --> 28:05.271

That's it.

28:08.524 --> 28:10.526
ARCHIE: Come back.

28:17.700 --> 28:20.912
Another normal day
at Glenbogle, then?

28:20.995 --> 28:24.499
-Where's your friend?
-Alan? Wouldn't be much help.

28:24.582 --> 28:26.959
He's a bit scared
of farm animals.

28:27.043 --> 28:29.003
In that case I'll
order some more.

28:30.755 --> 28:32.507
Are you here
about the blood tests?

28:33.508 --> 28:35.551
Blood tests will take weeks.

28:35.635 --> 28:37.470
I can't wait that long.

28:37.553 --> 28:39.555
DUNCAN: One, two, three...

28:41.683 --> 28:43.601
-Duncan, where are you going?
-Hang on, hang on.

28:43.685 --> 28:45.395
Duncan? Oh!

28:57.615 --> 28:58.950
Oh, no!

29:09.961 --> 29:12.046
Could you take a look at this?

29:12.672 --> 29:14.257
(CHUCKLING)

29:15.049 --> 29:16.759
Ah, this takes me back.

29:17.885 --> 29:20.972
When was this? '72...

29:21.055 --> 29:24.559
-KATRINA: Where was it taken?
-St Michael's Island.

29:24.642 --> 29:26.853
It's an old chapel
just outside Inverness.

29:27.979 --> 29:30.815
Doesn't Miriam look good?

29:30.898 --> 29:33.359
She had an old friend
that used to visit up there.

29:33.443 --> 29:35.695
Joan McBride was her name.

29:35.778 --> 29:37.989
And do you think
she would know?

29:38.072 --> 29:40.408
Could give her a ring.

29:40.491 --> 29:44.871
-Thanks, Golly.
-You're welcome, lass.
Good luck.

29:48.750 --> 29:51.878
-Any chance of a lift?
-Hmm?

29:51.961 --> 29:53.629
Well,
I can't do this by phone.

29:57.884 --> 30:01.763
ARCHIE: It's the isolation.
Same with all
these farmers up here.

30:01.846 --> 30:05.224
They wander the hills all day
with no one to talk
to but the animals,

30:05.308 --> 30:07.060
and every niggle gets blown up

30:07.143 --> 30:10.229
into some Sicilian vendetta
they want me to sort out.

30:10.313 --> 30:12.065
Well,
you volunteered to be laird.

30:12.148 --> 30:13.900
I didn't volunteer.

30:15.485 --> 30:17.362
Nobody's making
you stick at it.

30:17.445 --> 30:20.823
-I owe it to my family.
-Very selfless of you.

30:20.907 --> 30:24.577
I suppose you can't bear
all those tenants
doffing their caps.

30:24.660 --> 30:27.038
I haven't noticed anyone
doffing anything actually.

30:27.121 --> 30:28.706
Anyway,
you needn't look so smug.

30:28.790 --> 30:31.542
If you're a MacDonald,
you'll have to share
the duties of the laird.

30:31.626 --> 30:34.379
-I don't want them.
-Well,
tell that to these guys.

30:39.008 --> 30:41.386
Archie, why are you stopping?

30:41.469 --> 30:44.263
I'm not stopping.
The car's stopping.

-Well, this is
definitely the engine.

31:17.714 --> 31:19.799
Don't you know
anything about cars?

31:19.882 --> 31:22.468
Almost as much as I
do about goat breeding.

31:24.053 --> 31:26.681
It's only 8:00. I'll head
back to the nearest village.

31:26.764 --> 31:29.767
That's nearly 10 miles.
Forget it, Archie.

31:58.379 --> 32:00.089
Did you bring your toothbrush?

32:00.173 --> 32:02.050
Ah, someone's bound
to come along soon.

32:02.133 --> 32:04.719
Well, I hope so.
I've got school on Monday.

32:04.802 --> 32:06.220
Why don't you
crash in the back?

32:06.304 --> 32:07.930
Duncan's got
a mattress in there.

32:08.014 --> 32:10.725
In case he gets
lucky at a rave.

32:10.808 --> 32:13.227
-And what about you?
-I'll be all right.

32:14.228 --> 32:16.522
Don't be daft. Come on.

32:39.170 --> 32:41.464
Shall I bring
up another crate?

32:41.547 --> 32:43.800
What do women
want from men, Lexie?

32:45.426 --> 32:46.594
Mmm, money.

32:47.345 --> 32:50.223
Security, um, respect.

32:51.182 --> 32:53.476
A nice tight bum.

32:53.559 --> 32:56.979
Oh, sorry, did you want those
in order of preference?

32:57.063 --> 32:59.357
Does fidelity
appear on the list?

32:59.440 --> 33:01.109
Honesty's in there somewhere.

33:01.192 --> 33:04.278
Mmm. You've never
been married, have you?

33:04.362 --> 33:05.947
You got well steamed

33:06.030 --> 33:08.116
Molly was fooling around
with that bookie.

33:08.199 --> 33:10.868
Oh, really,
there's no comparison.
The man's an oik.

33:10.952 --> 33:14.664
And I suppose this housekeeper
was a baroness on
work experience?

33:16.207 --> 33:18.626
I should have known
better than to ask the cook.

33:21.170 --> 33:25.008
Aye, well, here's
another tip from the kitchen.

33:25.091 --> 33:28.177

-And arguing.

-Like who?
-Like Alan.

with such a creep?

He's not that bad.

ended up with him.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Looks like you've
had a wasted journey.

36:02.123 --> 36:04.167
It was the only
photograph she kept.

It must have
meant a lot to her.

-Come on.
-Where?

No, no. No, that's all sorted.
No, this is more
personal history.

this is Katrina Finlay.

37:50.732 --> 37:52.900

-Only we haven't
got much to go on.

-Apart from this photo.
-Oh, may I?

38:01.034 --> 38:02.452
That's my mother.

38:02.535 --> 38:05.204
We think she had an affair
with Hector MacDonald.

We came here
looking for proof,

only there's not much
you can tell from a photo.

38:09.167 --> 38:12.462
On the contrary,
you can tell a great deal.

38:12.545 --> 38:15.465
Your mother's not
smiling at Hector.

-So who took the photo?
-I did.

You're...Miriam's daughter?

38:36.402 --> 38:38.488
I didn't catch your name.

38:38.571 --> 38:42.533
Harold Xavier.
She used to call me 'H'.

38:46.537 --> 38:48.247
It started with a look,

38:48.331 --> 38:52.710
a touch,
as we passed in the hallway.

38:54.128 --> 38:56.673
It was intense. It...

38:58.049 --> 39:00.009
It was extraordinary...

39:02.053 --> 39:04.138
and it was insane.

39:06.015 --> 39:07.350
It couldn't last.

another father, no.

-I think it's great.

Without anyone threatening
your inheritance, you mean?

40:29.891 --> 40:33.353
Of course you're also relieved
because now you can climb
back on your pedestal.

-Oh, big deal, pal.
-And, of course, the money.

43:05.797 --> 43:08.341
-Er, money?
-Yes.

43:08.424 --> 43:13.554
The deed of 1804
allows for a grant of Â£30.

43:13.638 --> 43:16.474
And how much would
that be worth today?

43:19.268 --> 43:20.687
Exactly...

43:21.312 --> 43:22.980
Â£30.

43:23.648 --> 43:24.816
Thank you.

43:24.899 --> 43:27.735
Now, if you'll
excuse me, gentlemen,

43:27.819 --> 43:30.154
I am having
lunch with my niece.

43:30.238 --> 43:32.073
-Good day.
-Good day.

43:35.326 --> 43:38.746
Here. Seeing as how
you've pulled out
most of your own.

43:40.540 --> 43:42.500
What about the m...
Half of that's mine.

43:42.583 --> 43:44.752
I'll take it out
of what you owe me.

43:44.836 --> 43:46.421
There's no rush.

43:46.504 --> 43:48.423
I'm gonna have to
tell Lexie that...

43:49.966 --> 43:51.175
Lexie.

43:51.259 --> 43:53.219
Lexie! I'm not a duke!

43:54.762 --> 43:56.597
Lexie!

43:56.681 --> 43:59.100
Why didn't
MacDonald just tell you?

43:59.183 --> 44:01.686
Why did he put you
through all that anguish?

44:01.769 --> 44:04.689
You've got a case against him
for mental cruelty, surely.

44:04.772 --> 44:07.525
I don't have a case.
I'm not interested.

44:07.608 --> 44:09.444
Archie put you up to this.

44:09.527 --> 44:12.864
Contrary to what
you seem to believe,
I do have a mind of my own.

44:12.947 --> 44:15.116
Fine, fine. It's just that...

44:15.992 --> 44:18.327
What?

44:18.411 --> 44:22.665
-Well, it was only a bit
of groundwork, that's all.
-What was? What have you done?

44:23.875 --> 44:25.501
I spoke to McLintock.

44:25.585 --> 44:28.504
-The journalist?
-Well, it was deep background,
off the record.

44:28.588 --> 44:30.340
Och, you know what that means.

44:30.423 --> 44:33.301
It means my picture all
over the Sunday tabloids.

44:33.384 --> 44:35.720
"Spurned
Love-child of Lusty Laird."

44:35.803 --> 44:38.973
You've got to admit it
has a certain ring to it.

44:39.057 --> 44:41.976
-Phone him. Now.
-It's not too late to...

44:46.939 --> 44:50.276
Gordon?
It's Alan. Alan Smythe.

44:53.404 --> 44:55.073
About that story.

44:55.782 --> 44:58.868
Yes. Great.

45:00.411 --> 45:03.039
There's just one
minor detail...

45:04.874 --> 45:06.250
It was a hoax.

45:07.835 --> 45:09.879
What can I tell you?

45:09.962 --> 45:11.172
I know.

45:12.840 --> 45:14.258
I'm disgusted.

45:30.566 --> 45:31.901
Molly.

45:33.027 --> 45:35.863
What am I going
to do with you?

45:35.947 --> 45:38.074
I know it was
silly of me, but...

45:38.157 --> 45:40.451
I never thought a gentleman
discussed that sort of thing.

45:40.535 --> 45:42.620
Not even with his wife?

45:42.704 --> 45:44.330
Especially with his wife.

45:44.414 --> 45:48.001
I was...embarrassed,
I suppose.

45:48.084 --> 45:49.961
That you hadn't had an affair?

45:50.044 --> 45:52.964
I mean,
the laird is supposed to...

45:53.047 --> 45:54.632
It's part of his duties...

45:54.716 --> 45:58.678
Ordering the estate,
administering justice,
tupping the housemaids.

45:58.761 --> 46:01.097
Only I never felt inclined.

46:01.180 --> 46:05.059
-You're just an old fraud.
-Well, the thing is I...

46:05.143 --> 46:07.103
I've never loved
anyone but you.

46:07.979 --> 46:10.356
It's pathetic, isn't it?

46:10.440 --> 46:13.401
You're supposed to
kiss me at this point.

46:16.529 --> 46:19.449
-Are you deaf? I said kiss.
-I heard what you said.

46:23.619 --> 46:26.664
They've had half the shrubs,
all the roses and
your dress shirt.

46:26.748 --> 46:28.708
They're not goats,
they're locusts.

46:28.791 --> 46:30.543
What the hell am I
supposed to do with them?

46:30.626 --> 46:33.004
That will take
the judgement of Solomon.

46:33.087 --> 46:34.339
Go on.

47:01.657 --> 47:03.659
Thank you for coming,
gentlemen. I wanted to...

47:03.743 --> 47:05.661
It's well for you, laddie.
I've got a farm to run.

47:05.745 --> 47:09.123
You do not interrupt the laird
when he's speaking, Mr Pearce!

47:09.207 --> 47:10.792
You were not asked to sit.

47:10.875 --> 47:12.543
Oh, hold on a wee minute.

47:12.627 --> 47:14.796
Hats off in
the laird's presence.

47:18.800 --> 47:21.511
As you know,
I wanted you to take
this to a proper court,

47:21.594 --> 47:24.514
but it seems you've
given me no choice.

47:24.597 --> 47:26.474
So with the greatest
reluctance,

47:26.557 --> 47:29.185
I've decided to take matters
into my own hands.

47:29.268 --> 47:31.688
According to
ancient highland law,

47:31.771 --> 47:35.483
any livestock that
despoils my garden
becomes my property.

47:35.566 --> 47:38.277
-What?
-To dispose of as I see fit.

47:39.821 --> 47:41.823
I've struck a rather poor deal

47:41.906 --> 47:44.992
with a Lebanese restaurant
in Glasgow specialising
in barbecued goat.

47:45.076 --> 47:47.245
Och, you're not sending
them for the slaughter.

47:47.328 --> 47:49.288
They're worth far
more as milkers.

47:49.372 --> 47:52.333
They're paying me 50 quid
and I'm keeping the lot.

47:53.209 --> 47:54.961
Good day, gentlemen.

47:55.044 --> 47:57.380
Now, wait.
I mean, hold on a minute.

47:57.463 --> 47:59.674
It's a sinful waste
to slaughter them.

48:01.050 --> 48:02.969
He can keep them.

48:03.052 --> 48:04.345
He can have them.

48:04.429 --> 48:06.347
Better that than
they all go to waste.

48:06.431 --> 48:08.516
I'm sorry,
I've made my decision.

48:08.599 --> 48:10.560
Please, your lairdship.

48:11.644 --> 48:13.146
I'm sorry about your garden.

48:14.147 --> 48:15.648
I'll make good the damage.

48:20.028 --> 48:22.572
Pearce can have
the two male kids,
Johnston keeps the rest.

48:22.655 --> 48:26.159
You can take them
with you now. After this,
the matter is closed.

48:26.242 --> 48:28.953
-Fine.
-Ah, yeah, suits me.

48:29.037 --> 48:31.039
Thank the laird.

48:31.122 --> 48:32.707
-Thank you.
-Aye, thanks.

48:38.338 --> 48:39.922
(DOOR CLOSING)

48:41.924 --> 48:44.302
Yes!

48:44.385 --> 48:48.264
I actually wrote a paper
on ancient highland
laws and customs.

48:48.348 --> 48:50.725
I never came across that one
about the grazing rights.

48:50.808 --> 48:53.394
Oh,
yes, an extremely ancient one
that I just made up.

48:53.478 --> 48:56.439
Ah, that would explain it.
Ah, Molly.

48:58.816 --> 49:01.778
-Thanks for everything.
-Don't leave it
so long next time.

49:02.737 --> 49:06.324
Hector. Everything all right?

49:06.407 --> 49:09.160
Oh, it's nothing.
Just a kick from
a temperamental mare.

49:09.243 --> 49:11.287
Watch it or
I'll kick the other one.

49:11.371 --> 49:13.915
Ah, well,
you mind you take it easy.

49:13.998 --> 49:16.209
-So long.
-Bye, Harold.

49:19.170 --> 49:22.215
Well, thank you, Archie,
it's been a revelation.

49:36.229 --> 49:37.647
I'll see you, Harold.

49:37.730 --> 49:39.357
(EXCLAIMING)

49:40.817 --> 49:42.026
I'll write.

50:01.921 --> 50:05.216
Oh, I forgot to thank him
for not ennobling the staff.

50:05.299 --> 50:06.926
Of course.

50:07.010 --> 50:10.847
It's bad enough dealing
with bolshie crofters,
never mind usurpers.

50:10.930 --> 50:14.350
Look, they asked me to play
that role. I only gave them
what they wanted.

50:14.434 --> 50:17.937
-Aye, but you
enjoyed it, didn't you?
-No.

50:18.021 --> 50:22.316
-You're a good laird but
you're a hopeless liar.
-You think I'm a good laird?

50:22.400 --> 50:24.652
-No.
-That's what you said.

50:24.736 --> 50:27.905
You're good as lairds go
but the sooner
they go, the better.

50:27.989 --> 50:29.449
You think I'm a good laird.

50:29.532 --> 50:31.325
-No, I do not.
-Yes, you do.
I heard you say it.

50:31.409 --> 50:33.202
-I heard you say it.
-I don't think
you're a good laird.

50:33.286 --> 50:34.787
Victory for me!
