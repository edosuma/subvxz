00:22.800 --> 00:26.086
Come on! Knock it off.
Knock it off!

00:28.216 --> 00:31.149
Gardner, keep telling them
you're innocent.

00:38.286 --> 00:41.144
Don't let them see you're afraid, kid!

00:44.197 --> 00:45.739
It'll be all right, son.

00:46.908 --> 00:52.827
I didn't wanna do it, sir.
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry!

00:53.748 --> 00:56.868
I didn't... Sir? Sir?

00:57.543 --> 01:01.772
It won't happen again, sir.
I didn't want...

01:14.644 --> 01:16.471
I didn't...

01:19.690 --> 01:21.233
Private Arthur James Gardner...

01:21.400 --> 01:24.437
you've been found guilty
as charged for the crime of murder.

01:24.654 --> 01:27.145
Your case has been appealed
three times...

01:27.323 --> 01:28.865
and reviewed three times.

01:29.075 --> 01:32.325
The verdict of each court-martial
has been the same:

01:32.495 --> 01:33.870
Guilty as charged.

01:34.956 --> 01:38.325
Do you have anything to say before
sentence is carried out?

01:39.252 --> 01:41.162
I didn't mean it.

01:43.173 --> 01:44.549
I... I'm sorry.

01:49.096 --> 01:51.005
I didn't mean to.

01:52.559 --> 01:54.644
I'm sorry.

02:07.365 --> 02:09.239
Open it up.

02:11.453 --> 02:13.160
Enjoy the show, major?

02:43.234 --> 02:44.729
I want to see Major Armbruster.

02:44.903 --> 02:47.738
- Just down the corridor...
- Yeah, I know where it is. I know.

02:49.991 --> 02:51.948
John. Good to see you.

02:52.118 --> 02:55.368
Don't you give me that. We had
dinner last night together, remember?

02:57.708 --> 03:01.243
Be nice. Take it easy.

03:04.048 --> 03:08.092
This time it's serious, John.
You've gotta cooperate.

03:08.719 --> 03:10.130
Let's go.

03:18.437 --> 03:21.224
Colonel.
General is waiting, major.

03:29.032 --> 03:30.692
Major Reisman, sir.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.327
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.

03:40.544 --> 03:42.121
- Sit down, major.
- Thank you, sir.

03:49.553 --> 03:52.388
Well, major, what did you think
of the hanging?

03:53.640 --> 03:56.676
Looked very efficient.
Then again, I'm not an expert.

03:56.893 --> 04:00.808
I meant, how did you
personally feel about it?

04:01.022 --> 04:03.145
It wasn't the nicest way
to spend an evening.

04:03.567 --> 04:06.402
Well, it wasn't staged
for your entertainment, you know.

04:06.570 --> 04:08.479
I hope Private Gardner
was aware of that.

04:08.697 --> 04:10.274
- Private who?
- Private Gardner.

04:10.449 --> 04:12.904
He was the object of the exercise.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.241
There happens to have
been a reason, major.

04:17.874 --> 04:20.281
I've got your service record here, major.

04:21.627 --> 04:25.542
A lot of fireworks. A lot of transfers.

04:25.756 --> 04:29.540
One tough scrape after another,
very short on discipline.

04:30.636 --> 04:33.258
Very short on discipline.

04:35.433 --> 04:37.805
I hear you did a pretty good job in Italy.

04:38.394 --> 04:42.143
Then you loused it up by exceeding your
orders. And that's not the first time.

04:42.356 --> 04:45.808
- I didn't write those reports, sir.
- What is that supposed to mean?

04:45.985 --> 04:48.357
I don't necessarily agree
with what's in them.

04:48.571 --> 04:52.023
- Maybe you'd like to write your own?
- No, thank you, sir.

04:53.118 --> 04:56.867
I'm not very interested in embroidery,
only results.

04:59.583 --> 05:02.335
Now, you hold it right there.

05:02.544 --> 05:05.664
This war was not started
for your private gratification.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.832
And you can be damn sure
that this Army...

05:08.008 --> 05:10.713
isn't being run for your
personal convenience, either.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.594
You've been waiting for a transfer
for over two months now.

05:17.810 --> 05:20.976
With a record like yours,
you could go on waiting forever.

05:21.146 --> 05:25.226
However, I get orders too.
And right now I've got some...

05:25.442 --> 05:28.645
that sound as if they were made
for somebody just like you.

05:28.821 --> 05:31.822
Personally, I don't go for this
behind-the-lines nonsense.

05:31.991 --> 05:35.989
As far as I'm concerned, a soldier's job
is to wear his uniform and kill the enemy.

05:37.038 --> 05:38.449
But that's another matter.

05:39.124 --> 05:41.615
I'm gonna ask General Denton
to read these orders...

05:41.793 --> 05:43.335
just as they came down to us.

05:43.503 --> 05:45.911
After, if you have any questions, ask.
Understand?

05:46.089 --> 05:47.963
- Yes, sir.
- General.

05:51.594 --> 05:53.005
"Project Amnesty:

05:53.221 --> 05:55.677
You will select 12 prisoners
sentenced to death...

05:55.849 --> 05:59.929
or long-term imprisonment for murder,
rape, robbery or other violent crimes.

06:00.103 --> 06:03.472
Train these prisoners in as much of the
behind-the-lines operations...

06:03.648 --> 06:06.435
as they can absorb in a brief
but unspecified time.

06:06.651 --> 06:10.102
You'll then deliver them secretly
to Europe and prior to the invasion...

06:10.280 --> 06:14.527
attack and destroy the target
specified: Overleaf."

06:15.952 --> 06:17.612
- That's all?
- That's all.

06:18.955 --> 06:21.625
What about the target specified,
Overleaf?

06:21.834 --> 06:23.625
Doesn't concern you now.

06:24.044 --> 06:25.788
Well, what do you say, major?

06:26.088 --> 06:29.172
I'd say it confirms a suspicion
I've had for some time now, sir.

06:29.341 --> 06:31.714
Do you think we might share
that suspicion, major?

06:31.927 --> 06:33.007
I think you should.

06:33.220 --> 06:36.055
Since I'll have to assume we're
over here to win the war...

06:36.223 --> 06:37.883
it wouldn't pay to advertise...

06:38.058 --> 06:40.894
that one man we're working for
is a raving lunatic.

06:41.103 --> 06:44.721
Now, that's enough, major. You're here
to be briefed on an operation.

06:44.899 --> 06:47.650
You have permission to ask questions
about that operation.

06:47.818 --> 06:50.441
You do not have permission
to make personal comments...

06:50.655 --> 06:53.407
concerning the officers
responsible for its conception.

06:53.575 --> 06:55.069
- Now, is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

06:55.243 --> 06:57.117
Ask relevant questions or shut up.

06:57.329 --> 07:00.080
Is it relevant to ask why I'm being
offered this mission?

07:00.248 --> 07:03.997
It's not, as you say, being offered.

07:04.711 --> 07:06.538
I'm volunteering.

07:06.713 --> 07:08.124
Exactly, major.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.878
I'm glad you look at these things
so realistically.

07:11.468 --> 07:15.300
I don't mean to appear unduly cautious,
but if my personal survival...

07:15.514 --> 07:17.886
depends on the performance
of 12 deadheads...

07:18.058 --> 07:21.224
it might be helpful to know exactly
what I'm training them for.

07:21.436 --> 07:24.188
Now, that's a very good question, major.

07:24.397 --> 07:27.766
- Armbruster, let's have the basic outline.
- Yes, sir.

07:30.112 --> 07:33.527
"The Germans are using a large chateau
near Rennes in Brittany...

07:33.740 --> 07:37.572
as a rest center and a conference
place for general staff officers."

07:37.786 --> 07:40.028
The target has no real
military value itself...

07:40.247 --> 07:43.865
but with these conferences, discussion
groups and the like going on...

07:44.042 --> 07:47.292
there's hardly a day when
there aren't a considerable number...

07:47.462 --> 07:49.787
of important general officers
in residence.

07:49.965 --> 07:53.085
Usually with the benefit
of female companionship.

07:53.845 --> 07:57.344
"Eliminating a number of senior
officers couldn't but have the effect...

07:57.515 --> 07:59.424
of disrupting
their chain of command."

07:59.725 --> 08:02.477
The idea is simply that our men
are dropped by parachute.

08:02.645 --> 08:05.980
They enter the chateau and kill
as many senior officers as is possible...

08:06.150 --> 08:07.976
in the time available.

08:09.361 --> 08:12.860
Naturally, the place is fortified
and heavily guarded.

08:13.073 --> 08:15.695
Naturally.
What's the deal with the men?

08:15.909 --> 08:18.946
None whatsoever. Let's have
no misunderstanding about that.

08:19.121 --> 08:20.995
It's exactly what it says, an amnesty.

08:21.165 --> 08:24.450
A temporary postponement.
You take it or leave it on that basis.

08:24.668 --> 08:27.954
Like you say, sir, let's not
have any misunderstandings.

08:28.172 --> 08:29.998
I don't like it. I think it stinks.

08:30.174 --> 08:31.834
I've had enough of your insolence.

08:32.009 --> 08:34.500
It's not a question of insolence
but of practicality.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.126
I'm the guy that's being asked
to sell this idea...

08:37.306 --> 08:39.464
to 12 happy, smiling faces, right?

08:40.308 --> 08:43.678
They do have an alternative way to go,
you know.

08:44.521 --> 08:48.139
- That's no way for anybody to go.
- Oh, the hell you say, major.

08:48.317 --> 08:51.152
Why, I know a lot of people
who should go exactly that way.

08:55.324 --> 08:56.735
But that's beside the point.

08:56.909 --> 08:59.863
Now, come on, major,
what's your basic objection?

09:00.078 --> 09:03.697
These men are, by definition,
incapable of any discipline or authority...

09:03.874 --> 09:05.416
much less intensive training.

09:05.584 --> 09:08.704
If there isn't a possibility
for a remission of their sentence...

09:08.879 --> 09:12.746
they have nothing to look forward to
and no reason to cooperate, right?

09:14.218 --> 09:18.215
Got a point.
You got a point, major.

09:19.181 --> 09:21.388
However, as you know,
I don't have the power...

09:21.559 --> 09:23.886
to reverse the findings
of a court-martial.

09:24.104 --> 09:27.058
You do have the power to commute
the sentence of such a court.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.691
- Excuse me, general.
- Yes?

09:28.901 --> 09:32.946
You do have authority under the Visiting
Forces Act to make such a ruling.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.990
- Visiting Forces Act?
- Yes, sir.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.078
All right, major, you got a deal.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.868
Let's say that if any of these men
distinguish themselves...

09:45.084 --> 09:49.034
then we will give serious consideration
to commuting their sentences.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.998
That's no deal.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.794
Who's to say whether they really
distinguish themselves or not?

09:55.010 --> 09:57.252
You can leave that decision to me.

09:57.429 --> 10:01.261
But remember, the other alternative
will apply with equal force.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.346
Any breach of security,
any failure of discipline...

10:04.520 --> 10:07.058
those prisoners go right back
where they came from.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.850
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.774
Good. Anything more, gentlemen?

10:11.318 --> 10:14.355
Well, yes, sir. I noticed
Colonel Breed in the waiting room.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.276
I wondered whether he was
connected with this operation.

10:18.117 --> 10:21.901
- What if he is?
- I'd be very unhappy, sir.

10:24.415 --> 10:27.831
Major, Colonel Breed
is your superior officer.

10:28.043 --> 10:30.617
And you will behave
accordingly, at all times.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.293
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

10:35.301 --> 10:39.298
Now, it so happens that Colonel Breed
is not concerned with this operation.

10:39.472 --> 10:43.055
But he is running the parachute school
where part of your training will be.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.969
I don't want to hear any complaints,
from either of you.

10:48.273 --> 10:51.477
Now, you've got a job to do,
mister, so move it.

10:51.986 --> 10:53.101
Yes, sir.

10:54.781 --> 10:55.823
Thank you, gentlemen.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.703
Major Reisman seems to be heading
to his own court-martial.

11:07.877 --> 11:10.415
He's the most ill-mannered,
ill-disciplined officer...

11:10.588 --> 11:12.581
it's ever been my displeasure to meet.

11:12.799 --> 11:14.459
You think so, Denton?

11:14.675 --> 11:19.551
You may be right.
But he's sure right about one thing.

11:19.764 --> 11:23.014
Somebody up there must be
a raving lunatic.

11:24.060 --> 11:25.684
Let's get Colonel Breed in here.

11:38.783 --> 11:39.826
Open.

11:39.992 --> 11:43.527
All right, you men,
this is an exercise period.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.324
So exercise!

12:01.557 --> 12:04.048
Major Reisman, Sergeant Bowren, sir.

12:05.394 --> 12:08.514
- Have the prisoners fall in.
- Sir.

12:08.730 --> 12:13.606
Prisoners, fall in.
All right, come on now. Get with it!

12:16.488 --> 12:19.407
- Come on, come on.
- Move it!

12:19.576 --> 12:22.992
Come on, move!
Hey, you, move, I said, move.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.172
"Franko, V.R.

12:38.970 --> 12:40.678
Death by hanging.

12:51.608 --> 12:53.600
Vladek, M.

12:54.527 --> 12:55.938
Thirty years' hard labor.

13:03.912 --> 13:06.403
Jefferson, R.T.

13:07.290 --> 13:09.199
Death by hanging.

13:16.550 --> 13:18.757
Pinkley, V.L.

13:20.554 --> 13:22.132
Thirty years' imprisonment.

13:31.857 --> 13:33.649
Gilpin, S.

13:34.443 --> 13:36.187
Thirty years' hard labor.

13:43.327 --> 13:45.035
Posey, S.

13:46.122 --> 13:47.450
Death by hanging.

13:53.171 --> 13:55.211
Wladislaw, T.

13:55.632 --> 13:57.423
Death by hanging.

14:00.303 --> 14:02.343
Sawyer, S.K.

14:03.098 --> 14:04.925
Twenty years' hard labor.

14:09.855 --> 14:11.731
Lever, R.

14:13.733 --> 14:15.643
Twenty years' imprisonment.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.650
Bravos, T.R.

14:22.909 --> 14:24.866
Twenty years' hard labor.

14:30.584 --> 14:32.624
Jiminez, P.

14:34.630 --> 14:36.706
Twenty years' hard labor.

14:44.182 --> 14:46.423
Maggott, A.J.

14:49.103 --> 14:50.847
Death by hanging."

14:54.692 --> 14:58.737
All right, sergeant. Have them fall in
according to height, right to left.

15:02.408 --> 15:04.317
According to height, fall in!

15:04.535 --> 15:08.367
Come on, you jokers, you heard him.
Get in there! Fall in line!

15:12.084 --> 15:15.370
- Come on, move!
- Come on, come on. Turn around.

15:15.588 --> 15:18.127
Come on, here! I said, get in line.

15:22.513 --> 15:24.552
Straighten up your jacket there.

15:24.723 --> 15:26.383
Get over there.

15:27.976 --> 15:31.974
- All right, have them count off.
- Sir. Count off!

15:40.697 --> 15:43.319
Let's see what they can do
with a little close-order.

15:43.534 --> 15:46.653
- Hut, right!
- Right.

15:49.833 --> 15:52.335
Left, march!

15:54.087 --> 15:58.001
Hut, hut, hut, hut.

15:58.299 --> 16:03.507
Two, three, four, hut, hut, hut.
Two, three.

16:12.564 --> 16:14.603
Squad, halt!

16:18.027 --> 16:20.321
About face!

16:21.990 --> 16:24.397
Left, march!

16:27.454 --> 16:28.533
Squad, halt!

16:29.539 --> 16:33.323
Right face! At ease.

16:33.543 --> 16:36.876
Now, what did I say to you?
Or maybe you don't understand English!

16:38.256 --> 16:41.459
- What's the matter, Number 11?
- I got a pain.

16:45.430 --> 16:48.882
- Where does it hurt?
- Well, I'll tell you. It's...

16:50.352 --> 16:52.725
I wish you would.
And do it correctly, please.

16:52.897 --> 16:56.396
Oh, I don't have to say, sir, I...
To you or anyone else.

16:56.567 --> 16:59.900
And I don't have to march, either.
And I know the rules.

17:00.404 --> 17:01.898
Why don't you have to march?

17:02.072 --> 17:05.691
Because condemned men
don't have to drill.

17:08.914 --> 17:11.583
And there's nothing you can
do about it, mister.

17:12.459 --> 17:13.502
What's your name, son?

17:17.464 --> 17:18.743
Eleven.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.838
His name is Franko, sir.

17:24.262 --> 17:27.262
Franko, come over here a minute.
Come on.

17:41.947 --> 17:46.443
Look, you little bastard, either you
march or I'll beat your brains out.

17:46.618 --> 17:47.946
Understand?

18:03.426 --> 18:04.755
What'd you see, sergeant?

18:04.928 --> 18:08.511
I saw the major attacked by the prisoner
and forced to defend himself, sir.

18:08.890 --> 18:11.512
All right, have the prisoner
taken back to his cell.

18:11.726 --> 18:13.304
Take his head, I'll get his feet.

18:13.478 --> 18:16.230
Now let's see what they can do
with a little close-order.

18:16.398 --> 18:17.976
Yes, sir.

18:19.485 --> 18:22.190
Squad, ten-hut!

18:24.324 --> 18:25.819
Right face.

18:27.494 --> 18:30.495
Forward, march! Hut.

18:31.331 --> 18:33.538
Squad, halt!

18:34.418 --> 18:36.712
About face!

18:37.504 --> 18:39.995
Forward, march!

18:51.518 --> 18:54.270
General prisoner Franko, Victor, sir.

19:11.622 --> 19:13.032
So how's the jaw?

19:14.333 --> 19:17.832
If you're gonna act tough, you should
learn how to take care of yourself.

19:18.045 --> 19:19.539
You really should.

19:19.713 --> 19:21.871
You're worried about my jaw?

19:24.259 --> 19:26.548
Franko's pain bothers the major?

19:27.179 --> 19:30.133
You were a big man with
the syndicate back in Chicago?

19:32.476 --> 19:33.519
You've seen my record.

19:33.685 --> 19:36.722
Yeah, I've seen your record,
so let's knock it off, huh?

19:36.939 --> 19:39.264
So, what happens first
when you hit London?

19:39.441 --> 19:44.188
You get involved in a penny-ante stickup
and start blasting and kill some old guy.

19:44.364 --> 19:47.401
And come away with what?

19:47.868 --> 19:51.948
- What did you have when they got you?
- What did I have? What do you mean?

19:52.122 --> 19:54.530
Come on, big shot.
How much money did you have?

19:54.708 --> 19:56.784
I had enough.

19:57.962 --> 20:02.754
Two pounds and 10 shilling.
That's almost 10 dollars.

20:03.884 --> 20:06.458
You're gonna get yourself hung
for a lousy 10 bucks.

20:06.929 --> 20:09.420
- What's that to you?
- Nothing.

20:09.598 --> 20:12.683
Then why don't you get off my back?
You didn't come to visit me.

20:12.852 --> 20:13.894
What do you want?

20:14.061 --> 20:16.896
I don't care if they hang you
for 10 dollars or 10 cents.

20:17.064 --> 20:19.104
It makes no difference to me.

20:19.692 --> 20:24.567
But it just so happens that temporarily
I got a little pull around here.

20:24.780 --> 20:28.066
And I might be able to get you
off the hook, if I wanted to.

20:34.915 --> 20:36.493
Are you a general?

20:36.709 --> 20:40.409
You're not a general, and only
a general can grant my reprieve.

20:40.629 --> 20:42.289
Look, stupid.

20:44.467 --> 20:45.877
I'm making you a proposition.

20:46.051 --> 20:48.340
All I want from you
is a straight yes or no.

20:50.556 --> 20:53.557
- You talk, I'll listen.
- Okay.

20:54.393 --> 20:58.178
You either can sweat out the two days
you have before the hanging...

20:58.356 --> 21:00.764
or you join an outfit
that I'm putting together.

21:00.984 --> 21:04.483
If you do that, I'll have you
out of here in less than 24 hours.

21:04.654 --> 21:08.106
But you'll be worked to death, and
there's not a beating you won't take.

21:11.453 --> 21:14.407
And then
when I'm satisfied with you...

21:14.581 --> 21:18.247
you'll go where the Army tells you.
Chances are you'll get killed anyway.

21:18.419 --> 21:19.913
You don't know Victor Franko.

21:21.088 --> 21:22.796
- Guard.
- All right, what's the deal?

21:22.965 --> 21:24.673
What's the deal if I do stay alive?

21:24.884 --> 21:26.711
- Might get off the hook.
- Count me in.

21:26.928 --> 21:30.676
But you foul up once,
anywhere along the line, just once...

21:30.890 --> 21:33.346
and you'll be back here
at the end of a rope.

21:33.559 --> 21:37.094
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
What's the matter with you?

21:37.313 --> 21:39.555
You think I want to die?

21:45.988 --> 21:48.314
If you do, then you don't
know Victor Franko.

21:49.116 --> 21:50.361
How come you speak German?

21:51.285 --> 21:53.527
Because my old man was
a coal miner in Silesia.

21:53.746 --> 21:57.080
If he didn't speak German,
he didn't dig coal and he didn't eat.

21:57.291 --> 22:00.078
That was the language he spoke
when he came to the States?

22:00.336 --> 22:02.079
Pretty tough job in those days.

22:02.296 --> 22:04.123
Yeah, it still is.

22:04.340 --> 22:08.587
I don't like officers,
not any of them, and I never have.

22:10.805 --> 22:12.762
But you were one yourself,
weren't you?

22:14.142 --> 22:16.182
Yeah, three lousy days.

22:16.979 --> 22:19.648
Somebody must have thought
you'd make a good officer.

22:20.065 --> 22:22.354
They made a big mistake, didn't they?

22:22.818 --> 22:25.439
Well, I thought you claimed
he was going over the hill.

22:25.654 --> 22:28.062
What the hell are you talking about,
"claimed"?

22:28.240 --> 22:30.279
He was going over the hill.

22:30.868 --> 22:33.952
My outfit was pinned down by
the worst crossfire you ever saw.

22:34.163 --> 22:37.662
Half of them bleeding to death.
And this lover took off like a rabbit...

22:37.833 --> 22:39.742
with the medical supplies
on his back.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.285
The only way to stop him
was to shoot him.

22:44.006 --> 22:45.834
Anyhow, he had it coming.

22:46.593 --> 22:50.293
Yeah. But you only made
one mistake, huh?

22:52.599 --> 22:53.850
Guard.

22:56.478 --> 22:58.850
You let somebody see you do it.

23:08.364 --> 23:11.235
General prisoner Maggott, A.J., sir.

23:15.497 --> 23:18.284
"Maggott, A.J. Death by hanging."

23:18.458 --> 23:19.501
Hey, midnight.

23:19.709 --> 23:23.410
Be a real good boy, now, and maybe
I'll let you eat with the white folks.

23:35.810 --> 23:38.680
Well, Maggott, I see you've got
a sense of humor.

23:40.147 --> 23:44.726
The all-American hero,
laughing in the face of death.

23:50.699 --> 23:53.404
They're not gonna hang me, major.

23:55.329 --> 23:58.200
I never raped that evil slut...

23:59.124 --> 24:02.328
or any other creature.

24:02.503 --> 24:05.172
The Lord gave me that woman
and told me to chastise her.

24:05.381 --> 24:07.504
Then he told you to beat her
to death, huh?

24:07.716 --> 24:10.124
I only do what I'm called on to do.

24:12.096 --> 24:16.925
I was in a state of grace.
And that woman...

24:17.102 --> 24:18.845
she tried to soil my spirit.

24:19.062 --> 24:21.019
Well, I'm sure you were, Maggott.

24:21.231 --> 24:24.600
But it seems to me I remember
a quotation that goes like:

24:24.818 --> 24:26.016
Vengeance is mine.

24:28.071 --> 24:32.650
Vengeance is mine.
I will repay, sayeth the Lord.

24:32.868 --> 24:35.655
Paul to the Romans, Chapter 12.

24:36.496 --> 24:38.987
Exactly. Now, isn't that
supposed to mean...

24:39.207 --> 24:42.161
that we leave punishment
of the transgressors to his hands?

24:42.377 --> 24:46.505
That's right, major.
That's exactly what it means.

24:46.715 --> 24:51.010
But it doesn't restrict him to the kind
of tools he would use, now does it?

24:51.220 --> 24:55.265
And like I told you, major,
I only do what I'm called on to do.

24:56.017 --> 24:59.101
You know, Maggott, I don't think
you're going to hang after all.

25:01.689 --> 25:06.316
I think a man like you is destined
for higher things. Guard.

25:10.907 --> 25:16.114
Besides, us Southern boys have
to stick together now, don't we?

25:22.752 --> 25:25.041
I sure didn't mean to kill that fella.

25:25.254 --> 25:28.504
But you do like I say,
and maybe they won't hang you.

25:28.716 --> 25:31.717
Fixing to kill me some other way?

25:31.928 --> 25:33.470
It might not come to that.

25:34.388 --> 25:38.220
I reckon the folks would be a sight
happier if I died like a soldier.

25:41.479 --> 25:43.222
Can't say I would.

25:43.606 --> 25:46.228
Who does this hotshot major
think he is?

25:46.401 --> 25:48.560
Making us play wet nurses
to a bunch of scum.

25:48.737 --> 25:50.397
Corporal Morgan.

25:50.614 --> 25:54.659
If you can't find something to do,
I'll find something for you.

25:56.078 --> 25:57.869
Now, move it.

26:00.666 --> 26:03.702
Don't sweet-talk me, whitey.
You know why I'm here.

26:03.919 --> 26:06.755
Or maybe you think I should've let
those cracker bastards...

26:06.923 --> 26:08.583
go right ahead and castrate me?

26:09.008 --> 26:11.215
Seeing what those guys
tried to do to you...

26:11.386 --> 26:15.715
I'd say that you had
considerable justification.

26:16.808 --> 26:21.849
Thank you, Mr. Major, sir.
I really do thank you for that.

26:23.314 --> 26:27.644
But the court didn't agree, right?
So where does that leave you?

26:27.861 --> 26:31.111
I'm offering you an alternative,
which means you can keep fighting.

26:31.322 --> 26:34.027
- Who for, major?
- For yourself, if you want.

26:34.242 --> 26:37.362
But the Krauts,
they're the real master-race merchants.

26:37.579 --> 26:39.536
That's your war, man, not mine.

26:39.706 --> 26:42.707
You don't like the Krauts,
major, you fight them.

26:43.793 --> 26:46.035
Me, I'll pick my own enemies.

26:46.254 --> 26:50.168
That's your privilege. But you won't
be able to exercise it much longer.

26:50.341 --> 26:51.593
Guard.

26:52.010 --> 26:56.339
Because on March 25th,
you have a date with the hangman.

26:59.976 --> 27:02.467
That's just six days from now.

27:10.028 --> 27:12.067
<i>Buenos dias,</i> major.

27:14.492 --> 27:17.825
You know, sergeant, going over
the transcript of that man's trial...

27:18.037 --> 27:20.160
there are a couple of things
I don't get.

27:20.998 --> 27:23.917
Did he ever claim
that he didn't do it?

27:24.127 --> 27:27.959
I beg your pardon, but you haven't been
around prisons very much, have you?

27:28.173 --> 27:32.301
You see, the first thing one learns
in prison, everybody is innocent.

27:32.802 --> 27:36.218
This one, he doesn't say too much
about that one way or another.

27:36.431 --> 27:41.342
He's only disturbed because we don't
allow him to have strings for his guitar.

27:41.520 --> 27:43.429
Sergeant, did you ever lose a man...

27:43.605 --> 27:45.894
because he hung himself
with a guitar string?

27:46.066 --> 27:48.557
No, sir, I haven't,
and I'm not about to.

27:48.777 --> 27:51.350
Well, if he makes the trip,
see he gets the strings.

27:51.530 --> 27:52.858
Yes, sir.

27:58.787 --> 28:00.364
Attention!

28:07.504 --> 28:11.039
- Tell the men to be seated.
- Yes, sir. Take seats!

28:12.717 --> 28:14.046
- Guards out.
- Sir, I...

28:14.261 --> 28:16.502
- Guards out.
- Yes, sir.

28:16.805 --> 28:19.343
You heard him. Guards, out!

28:30.569 --> 28:34.518
My name, for those of you
who may have forgotten, is Reisman.

28:35.407 --> 28:39.535
You've all volunteered for a mission
which gives you just three ways to go:

28:39.703 --> 28:43.785
You can foul up in training and be sent
back here for execution of sentence...

28:43.959 --> 28:45.619
or you can foul up in combat...

28:45.836 --> 28:48.374
in which case
I'll blow your brains out...

28:48.589 --> 28:52.456
or you can do as you're told,
in which case you might just get by.

28:52.676 --> 28:54.550
You must not attempt to escape.

28:54.720 --> 28:57.092
There will be no excuses,
there will be no appeal.

28:57.639 --> 29:00.557
Any breach of either of these conditions
by any one of you...

29:00.726 --> 29:04.177
means you'll all be shipped back
for immediate execution of sentence.

29:05.481 --> 29:07.853
You are therefore dependent
upon each other.

29:08.066 --> 29:10.736
Any one of you try anything smart...

29:10.944 --> 29:13.779
and the 12 of you get it
right in the head, all right?

29:16.992 --> 29:19.068
So try to remember that.

29:20.078 --> 29:21.489
Now, are there any questions?

29:26.376 --> 29:27.419
Sir?

29:30.964 --> 29:33.171
Do we have to eat with niggers?

29:39.431 --> 29:41.673
It's all right.
The gentleman from the South...

29:41.892 --> 29:45.059
made some kind of inquiries
about the dining arrangements.

29:45.229 --> 29:48.728
He and his colleagues are discussing
the place-card settings. All right?

29:48.941 --> 29:51.645
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

29:55.572 --> 29:58.491
Look, corporal, fellas,
let's get with it, right? Remember?

29:58.701 --> 30:01.453
Baseball, pitching?
Chicago's always had the pitching.

30:01.621 --> 30:03.779
But now, as far as...
As far as hitting goes...

30:03.998 --> 30:07.332
well, my sister, she can hit
better than half them fellas.

30:08.670 --> 30:10.294
Let's move it out!

30:15.636 --> 30:19.337
- Well, what do you think, sergeant?
- I think you'll do just fine, sir.

30:19.557 --> 30:22.012
Don't give me that.
I said, what do you think?

30:25.312 --> 30:28.064
I think the first chance
one of them lovers gets...

30:28.274 --> 30:31.643
he's gonna shoot the major
right in the head, sir.

30:33.320 --> 30:35.396
- Thank you, sergeant.
- Sir.

30:37.116 --> 30:39.441
Okay, Franko. Let's go.

30:42.913 --> 30:44.573
All right, move it out.

31:21.286 --> 31:22.365
Come on.

31:44.811 --> 31:45.853
Over there.

31:53.569 --> 31:56.606
Sergeant, have the men fall in,
facing me.

31:56.781 --> 32:00.861
Sir. All right, on your feet. Fall in
over here, double-quick! Come on now!

32:02.411 --> 32:04.534
Come on, snap it up.
Snap it up!

32:08.292 --> 32:10.700
Jiminez, get in there!

32:12.380 --> 32:14.048
Ten-hut!

32:15.508 --> 32:18.462
All right, Franko, get rid
of that cigarette.

32:20.596 --> 32:21.639
Thank you.

32:23.307 --> 32:25.798
This will be your new home
until further notice.

32:26.352 --> 32:29.472
What there is of it will be built
by you, but the construction...

32:29.647 --> 32:31.854
will in no way interfere
with your training.

32:32.067 --> 32:35.934
So the sooner you get it up, the sooner
you'll be sleeping in out of the rain.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.732
- Sergeant.
- Sir?

32:39.158 --> 32:43.570
You're in charge. I want this compound
up and completed within the month.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.325
Thank you.

34:08.706 --> 34:11.458
If this place was on fire,
it'd burn to the ground.

34:11.668 --> 34:13.460
Come on, what are you doing?

34:13.670 --> 34:16.920
All right, come on. Let's move.
Come on.

34:21.262 --> 34:23.931
Hey, Maggott, what are you? German?

34:36.610 --> 34:39.018
Hey, what are you trying to do,
break the window?

34:39.237 --> 34:41.315
All right, sergeant, fall them in.

34:42.284 --> 34:44.739
Fall in, in front of the hut.
On the double!

34:44.911 --> 34:46.370
Round it up!

34:50.917 --> 34:52.161
At ease.

34:55.505 --> 34:57.794
All right, that'll be all for today.

34:58.133 --> 35:00.588
How come they got
all the comforts of home?

35:01.011 --> 35:04.759
Why can't we put our floor in?
Why can't we put our windows in?

35:04.973 --> 35:08.141
- Franko's right.
- I'd rather sleep in my cell.

35:08.728 --> 35:11.978
Mr. Franko, with his keen eye
for detail...

35:12.148 --> 35:15.398
has noted that the prisoners'
quarters are not yet ready.

35:16.777 --> 35:18.984
The answer to that is simple:

35:19.197 --> 35:21.948
You are not yet ready
to occupy that hut...

35:22.575 --> 35:25.280
with the degree of comfort
that you would like.

35:26.162 --> 35:29.578
When I think that you've earned
that privilege, I'll let you know.

35:31.375 --> 35:33.664
Reveille is at 0530.

35:33.878 --> 35:35.253
That is all. Sergeant.

35:35.755 --> 35:38.210
Sir. You heard the man, chow time!

35:38.424 --> 35:39.918
Dismissed!

35:42.345 --> 35:45.346
That's it, fellas. Speak up, boys.
Speak up.

35:51.062 --> 35:53.635
Wind it up, strike one!

35:54.649 --> 35:58.100
Hey, Joseph, is that the way
they did it in the Polish navy?

35:58.486 --> 36:00.360
You won't win any cigars that way.

36:06.327 --> 36:08.201
Hey, Franko, number please.

36:08.371 --> 36:10.244
Ask the operator for my nickel back.

36:10.456 --> 36:13.541
Why don't you guys
just dry up and blow away?

36:23.263 --> 36:26.050
<i>Meanwhile, on the Atlantic wall...</i>

36:26.266 --> 36:29.220
<i>the German forces</i>
<i>have been preparing...</i>

36:29.435 --> 36:32.105
<i>a few nice surprises for you,</i>
<i>gentlemen...</i>

36:32.313 --> 36:34.105
<i>just in case Mr. Churchill...</i>

36:34.274 --> 36:38.485
<i>is really foolish enough</i>
<i>to attempt an invasion.</i>

36:39.154 --> 36:42.238
<i>He may not be</i>
<i>unduly worried about this...</i>

36:42.407 --> 36:46.487
<i>but then, of course, he will not</i>
<i>be taking any active part...</i>

36:46.870 --> 36:47.984
<i>in such an...</i>

36:48.204 --> 36:50.280
Hey, what's this guy's name again?

36:50.456 --> 36:52.782
You ought to know.
You listen to him every night.

36:54.627 --> 36:57.414
- Dumbo, get me a cup of coffee.
- You crazy?

37:00.925 --> 37:02.717
I say shut the guy up.

37:04.095 --> 37:06.503
- Sleepy time.
- Hey, jump through this, will you?

37:19.110 --> 37:21.067
Hey, you. Come here.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.605
You look like an intelligent guy.

37:25.909 --> 37:28.779
- You like it here?
- No.

37:29.037 --> 37:30.448
You gonna stay here?

37:31.289 --> 37:35.038
- Well, I ain't got nowhere else to go.
- Ah, you're an idiot.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.042
Hey, Wladislaw.
You understand German.

37:43.220 --> 37:45.259
Who's that dame singing about?

37:47.140 --> 37:49.512
Well, it's about a very lonely girl...

37:50.060 --> 37:53.096
who's sick and tired of war
and being left alone.

37:53.980 --> 37:58.856
- Waiting for her man to come home.
- Keep that cheap, wailing slut quiet!

38:07.327 --> 38:09.948
Let's cut out the community sing.

38:10.247 --> 38:13.201
Get some sleep. You're gonna need it.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.041
Up yours.

38:15.335 --> 38:18.419
Creeps. They're all creeps.
That's what they are. Creeps.

38:32.018 --> 38:35.683
- Hey, where you going?
- Going to the can.

38:35.856 --> 38:37.765
- Want me to come with you?
- You kidding?

39:06.596 --> 39:07.876
They're after Franko.

39:24.364 --> 39:26.024
You trying to get us all hung?

39:26.200 --> 39:29.734
We're all dead anyway. Don't tell me
you believe that creep Reisman.

39:29.912 --> 39:33.779
Want that slick bum to make suckers
out of you? Whose side are you on?

39:40.547 --> 39:41.828
What's with you?

39:42.049 --> 39:45.714
What is this, anyway?
Uncle Tom week?

39:45.928 --> 39:48.169
You come with me, we're home free.

39:52.226 --> 39:53.803
He doesn't give a damn about you.

40:00.317 --> 40:03.982
If we go on that mission, we all
get killed. That's what they want!

40:04.196 --> 40:08.276
Those idiots in there are gonna get shot,
and they're not even due for hanging.

40:08.492 --> 40:12.490
You, you slob, you slob.
What do you think you got coming?

40:43.028 --> 40:46.113
- Slipped on a bar of soap, huh?
- Yeah.

40:48.284 --> 40:51.119
Pull with your arms,
hold with your legs.

40:51.662 --> 40:54.996
Pull with your arms,
hold with your legs.

40:55.207 --> 40:56.915
Come on, Jiminez. Move it.

40:57.126 --> 40:58.169
When the time comes...

40:58.335 --> 41:01.502
you've got exactly 34 seconds
to clear that distance.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.048
I really can't make it, major.

41:04.258 --> 41:07.294
Oh, come on, Jiminez.
Move it. Don't stop now.

41:07.511 --> 41:08.887
I can't! I can't!

41:09.263 --> 41:11.884
- Come on, Jiminez. Move.
- I really can't.

41:12.433 --> 41:15.138
I can't make it, major.
I can't make it! I can't make it!

41:15.352 --> 41:19.979
Jiminez! You come back down that rope,
you're going straight back to prison.

41:20.191 --> 41:23.690
I can't. I can't!
Really, I can't.

41:24.153 --> 41:27.023
Sergeant, give me that weapon.
Take a spin on that rope.

41:28.491 --> 41:32.572
I can't make it. I can't make it!
I can't!

41:33.622 --> 41:36.658
I really can't make it, major.
I can't!

41:42.297 --> 41:44.753
Boy, look at him go now!

41:50.972 --> 41:52.846
So you couldn't make it, huh?

41:53.517 --> 41:56.186
Okay, Posey, let's see a little
of that Apache know-how.

41:56.353 --> 41:59.472
Re-thread that pulley and get another
rope down here. Come on!

42:00.440 --> 42:02.848
Give these other characters
a crack at immortality.

42:03.068 --> 42:07.196
You said Mayonnaise was the only one
supposed to get on top of that chateau.

42:07.364 --> 42:12.442
But suppose Jiminez gets killed before
he gets to the top of that chateau.

42:12.745 --> 42:16.328
- Come on, Posey. Move it.
- Come on, get that thing up here.

42:16.541 --> 42:18.829
We'll have it ready in a minute, major.

42:21.128 --> 42:23.205
All right, Franko, you're next.

42:33.266 --> 42:35.342
All right, so much for hygiene
on the field.

42:36.310 --> 42:39.726
Now, which one of you guys would
like to stick this in the major?

42:41.524 --> 42:44.893
Well, major, if it's gonna
help the war effort...

42:45.069 --> 42:46.978
Franko, sit down.
You'll get your chance.

42:48.824 --> 42:50.235
Well, let's see...

42:51.201 --> 42:52.660
- Posey.
- Me?

42:52.870 --> 42:54.198
Yeah, step out here.

42:54.413 --> 42:55.658
I'd rather not, sir.

42:55.873 --> 42:58.909
Look, Posey, it's just an example.
Come on, now. Step out here.

42:59.334 --> 43:00.912
Now, will you hold this knife?

43:02.337 --> 43:05.007
Posey, it's got a scabbard on it.
It can't hurt anybody.

43:10.470 --> 43:13.092
Tell me, Posey,
what did they lock you up for?

43:13.265 --> 43:15.092
I mean, what did you do?

43:15.976 --> 43:17.351
I already told you that, sir.

43:17.561 --> 43:19.518
Well, tell me again.

43:19.688 --> 43:22.523
I'm sure that your friends
over here would like to know too.

43:22.733 --> 43:25.271
- What'd you do, Posey?
- Yeah, fill him in.

43:27.446 --> 43:30.779
This fella kept pushing me.
I don't like to be pushed, so I hit him.

43:31.158 --> 43:34.112
Killed a man with your bare hands
because he shoved you?

43:35.621 --> 43:37.329
I only hit him once.

43:38.081 --> 43:40.040
Only hit him once.

43:40.293 --> 43:44.540
And drove his jawbone right through
his brain because he pushed him.

43:44.923 --> 43:48.623
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- You didn't mean to kill him, but you did.

43:48.801 --> 43:52.301
Now, what would you do if you meant
to kill somebody? Could you do it?

43:54.140 --> 43:57.758
If you had to kill somebody with a knife,
do you think you could do it?

43:57.977 --> 43:59.804
- Come on. Tell me.
- I'd rather not.

43:59.979 --> 44:01.972
I don't care what you'd rather do.

44:02.190 --> 44:05.144
Come on, stick that knife in me.
You can do that. Come on.

44:05.860 --> 44:07.355
Major, I don't want to do this.

44:07.530 --> 44:10.484
Come on, Posey. Just stick it
right here in me, it won't hurt.

44:10.658 --> 44:11.737
Come on.

44:11.951 --> 44:14.868
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You're not. I'm gonna hurt you.

44:15.079 --> 44:17.118
- Posey, stick me.
- I don't want no trouble.

44:17.289 --> 44:20.207
You got no trouble. I'll give you
all the trouble you'll get.

44:20.376 --> 44:23.626
Come on, now, Posey. Just stick
that knife right there, right there.

44:23.838 --> 44:25.083
You're a big boy.

44:25.256 --> 44:27.663
You killed a man for shoving you?
I'm shoving you.

44:27.883 --> 44:30.172
- Come on. Let me have it.
- Stick him!

44:30.344 --> 44:34.176
I'm talking to you. Give it to me or I'm
gonna shove you right through the wall!

44:34.849 --> 44:36.509
Come on, Posey. Give it to him!

44:36.725 --> 44:38.848
- Stab him!
- Get him, Posey! Come on, Posey!

44:42.356 --> 44:44.562
I want that knife.
Why won't you give it to me?

44:44.733 --> 44:47.485
- I don't like to be shoved, major.
- You're being shoved!

44:50.364 --> 44:52.522
- Stick him!
- Knock him down, Posey!

44:52.700 --> 44:54.692
Posey. What a name for a guy like you.

44:54.869 --> 44:56.411
- Stop!
- Don't tell me what to do.

44:56.579 --> 44:58.571
- I'm giving orders.
- I don't like pushing.

44:58.747 --> 45:00.787
Give it to him, Pose! Come on!

45:00.958 --> 45:02.452
I don't like to be shoved.

45:04.920 --> 45:06.960
Stop pushing!

45:15.432 --> 45:17.555
Posey. Posey!

45:20.520 --> 45:22.264
- Posey.
- Yes, sir?

45:22.814 --> 45:24.226
Are you all right?

45:25.818 --> 45:26.861
Yeah.

45:27.862 --> 45:29.404
All right, now. Relax.

45:30.656 --> 45:32.364
Come on, get up.

45:36.537 --> 45:39.622
You know, you learn how to take care
of that temper of yours...

45:39.790 --> 45:42.281
ain't nobody gonna take
this knife away from you.

45:42.502 --> 45:43.782
You're right. I'm sorry.

45:44.003 --> 45:46.079
Okay, major. We're all set.

45:47.089 --> 45:49.462
All right, you go in
and see Captain Kinder.

45:49.675 --> 45:52.629
- What's he gonna do?
- He's just gonna talk to you, Posey.

45:53.596 --> 45:56.383
- Brush yourself off and go on in.
- Yes, sir.

45:58.893 --> 46:01.431
All right, which
of you gentlemen is next?

46:01.771 --> 46:03.977
Come on. I'm looking for a volunteer.

46:05.775 --> 46:08.182
All right, Maggott. You're next.

46:10.196 --> 46:12.485
Speed it up, men.
Come on, speed it up.

46:17.787 --> 46:18.830
They're looking good.

46:18.996 --> 46:22.412
Yes, sir. I hope they don't forget
what they're getting in shape for.

46:26.546 --> 46:29.463
Captain Kinder figures
maybe he can teach me letters.

46:29.632 --> 46:31.921
Folks back home would be proud
if I could write.

46:32.343 --> 46:35.629
Well, that would put you way ahead
of most of the guys around here.

46:36.639 --> 46:38.798
- Better fall in and join them.
- Yes, sir.

46:39.226 --> 46:41.682
It's true that I've been blessed...

46:41.896 --> 46:45.182
with an insight into women
that others don't have.

46:45.400 --> 46:49.647
And sometimes...
Well, sometimes I'm called upon...

46:49.821 --> 46:51.944
to use it in our beloved master's will.

46:52.532 --> 46:56.150
If women are your special province, why
do you hate Major Reisman so much?

46:58.913 --> 47:02.329
There are 11 evil men out there...

47:05.086 --> 47:07.542
and they must be punished
for their wickedness.

47:07.714 --> 47:10.169
And this Major Reisman,
he just snatched them up...

47:10.341 --> 47:14.090
from the brink of the pit, and he
cheated the master of his vengeance.

47:14.262 --> 47:17.179
And you think that's what God wants?
To punish these men?

47:17.891 --> 47:22.220
Oh, he will, captain. He will.
And Major Reisman too.

47:22.437 --> 47:25.521
- So, what does that give you?
- It doesn't give me anything.

47:25.732 --> 47:28.353
But along with these other results,
it gives you...

47:28.568 --> 47:32.566
about the most twisted, anti-social
bunch of psychopathic deformities ever.

47:33.031 --> 47:36.530
And the worst, the most dangerous
of the bunch is Maggott.

47:37.035 --> 47:41.364
You've got one religious maniac,
one malignant dwarf, two near-idiots...

47:41.581 --> 47:43.787
And the rest, I don't even want
to think about.

47:43.958 --> 47:46.366
Well, I can't think of a better way
to fight a war.

47:46.544 --> 47:50.162
The results of these tests
point to the fact that each man...

47:50.381 --> 47:55.209
has a built-in resentment against
any kind of authority. Any kind.

47:55.887 --> 47:58.260
- Don't you?
- But this is different.

47:58.432 --> 48:01.433
These guys think the U.S. Army
is their enemy, not the Germans.

48:01.602 --> 48:03.096
Well, they know the U.S. Army.

48:03.729 --> 48:06.054
But the Krauts haven't done
anything to them yet.

48:06.273 --> 48:07.733
Very sophisticated.

48:10.362 --> 48:12.401
Well, at least they know the U.S. Army.

48:12.822 --> 48:15.907
You can twist it any way you want.
But the point is...

48:16.076 --> 48:17.819
you are their main enemy.

48:17.994 --> 48:20.699
And when the time comes,
you'll be the number one target.

48:20.914 --> 48:23.405
Well, at least it gives them
something in common.

48:23.625 --> 48:24.668
What do you mean?

48:24.876 --> 48:28.541
They've come a long way individually,
further than we have a right to expect.

48:28.713 --> 48:30.753
But not as a unit. Not as a group.

48:30.924 --> 48:33.925
They've gotta function as a team.
And that's what's lacking.

48:34.135 --> 48:36.377
You think putting them
on guard duty will help?

48:36.555 --> 48:38.927
Well, it might give them
a sense of participation.

48:40.809 --> 48:44.142
Why don't you let me weed out
the real morons? Especially Maggott.

48:44.354 --> 48:48.434
I didn't pick these men, the Army did.
And I didn't pick the assignment either.

48:48.650 --> 48:52.101
This is one time the Army's going
with a starting lineup all the way.

48:52.404 --> 48:54.313
- Including Maggott?
- Including Maggott.

48:54.489 --> 48:56.945
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

48:58.994 --> 49:02.493
- We could get ourselves hurt, right?
- Why don't you shut up, huh?

49:02.664 --> 49:05.155
What's the matter?
You planning to save your mother?

49:05.375 --> 49:06.573
Why don't you lay off?

49:06.793 --> 49:08.702
Want me to show you
how to do it, huh?

49:09.462 --> 49:10.873
All right.

49:11.089 --> 49:16.250
Take my arm, put it around your neck.
Very simple, right?

49:16.470 --> 49:18.759
And then it's all in the leverage.

49:20.433 --> 49:23.102
Better learn how to fall.
You'll end up in a wheelchair.

49:23.269 --> 49:24.811
That's what I tried to tell him.

49:24.979 --> 49:27.648
Trouble is you just don't know
how to fall right. Here.

49:28.191 --> 49:30.397
Slob. Ah, that's a bad attitude.

49:30.610 --> 49:34.310
Kind of rough on the little fella,
aren't you? Like to try that with me?

49:43.749 --> 49:45.373
Now, this is really quite simple.

49:45.584 --> 49:48.075
I'm going to say a word,
and you come back at me...

49:48.253 --> 49:50.625
as fast as you can
with whatever comes to mind.

49:51.006 --> 49:54.790
For instance, if I were to say
"happiness," you might say "children."

49:55.010 --> 49:56.670
I wouldn't say that.

49:58.180 --> 49:59.722
Well, that was just an example.

49:59.890 --> 50:02.013
But if I said "ambition,"
what would you say?

50:03.519 --> 50:05.143
I wouldn't say anything.

50:06.647 --> 50:09.220
Well, let's give it a try, okay?

50:11.818 --> 50:13.858
- Weapon.
- Baseball.

50:14.071 --> 50:16.609
- Knife.
- Dodgers.

50:17.449 --> 50:19.442
- Officer.
- Pitcher.

50:21.119 --> 50:25.200
You seem to be thinking about
just one thing, aren't you?

50:25.374 --> 50:27.995
Yeah. What are you thinking about?

50:29.878 --> 50:32.964
Well, you see, I don't want you
to think of just one thing.

50:33.174 --> 50:36.923
I'd like for you to concentrate
on each word I throw at you. Okay?

50:38.388 --> 50:39.430
Okay.

50:41.140 --> 50:42.183
Food.

50:42.809 --> 50:44.220
Cincinnati.

50:45.895 --> 50:48.813
- Comfort.
- Chicago.

50:49.274 --> 50:53.106
- Now, what made you say that?
- That's what I was thinking about.

51:04.622 --> 51:06.283
The hell with it!

51:06.584 --> 51:08.327
Franko, what is it this time?

51:08.544 --> 51:10.702
How am I supposed to shave
in cold water?!

51:10.921 --> 51:13.958
You're in the field now.
Where are you gonna get hot water?

51:14.175 --> 51:16.251
The guards got hot water!
You got hot water!

51:16.510 --> 51:18.170
- You're in the field!
- That's tough.

51:18.387 --> 51:20.925
Right. How come you guys have
hot water and we don't?

51:21.098 --> 51:23.506
You keep quiet!
You keep your big mouth shut.

51:23.934 --> 51:26.686
- We ain't shaving in cold water!
- Not if all you don't.

51:26.896 --> 51:29.850
You want us to shave in cold water?
Why don't you?

51:30.065 --> 51:31.346
- That's right.
- Yeah!

51:31.567 --> 51:33.476
Franko means it.

51:33.694 --> 51:36.481
We ain't shaving. We ain't washing.
Not in cold water!

51:36.655 --> 51:38.081
- Is that right?
- That's right!

51:38.199 --> 51:40.108
The guards got hot, we won't use cold.

51:40.326 --> 51:41.440
And you can't make us!

51:41.619 --> 51:44.454
You're gonna get yourself
into hot water, Franko.

51:44.830 --> 51:46.823
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hang us?

51:47.082 --> 51:49.409
What can they do?
They can't do nothing!

51:49.586 --> 51:52.207
- Nothing.
- Now what are you gonna do?

51:55.133 --> 51:58.383
You know, I think Franko
might be right this time.

51:58.553 --> 52:01.507
Yeah, shaving in cold water
won't make us any better soldiers.

52:02.641 --> 52:05.013
Excuse me, sir.
We got some trouble outside.

52:05.477 --> 52:07.884
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear.

52:15.028 --> 52:17.436
- All right, sergeant. Fall them in.
- Yes, sir.

52:17.656 --> 52:19.814
All right, fall in. On your feet!

52:20.534 --> 52:22.360
Come on, right over here, Posey!

52:23.828 --> 52:25.868
Come on! Dress it up there. Get in line!

52:26.873 --> 52:30.076
What's this about refusing to shave?
Who is refusing to shave?

52:30.293 --> 52:31.835
- We are!
- Who is we?

52:32.170 --> 52:33.213
We!

52:34.172 --> 52:37.423
All those refusing to shave,
take one step forward.

53:00.241 --> 53:02.566
So you want to stink, huh?

53:03.494 --> 53:05.286
And maybe itch too?

53:05.538 --> 53:08.623
Well, that's okay with me
because I don't have to smell you.

53:09.042 --> 53:12.079
Sergeant, there will be no further
issue of shaving equipment...

53:12.254 --> 53:13.297
or the use of soap.

53:13.505 --> 53:15.747
And there will be no more hot meals.

53:16.175 --> 53:17.217
Just K rations.

53:18.302 --> 53:20.627
Courtesy of Mr. Franko.

53:27.811 --> 53:29.009
At ease.

53:31.190 --> 53:35.021
- Hey, I really think we got something.
- Yeah, it's what the Navy calls "mutiny."

53:35.194 --> 53:38.894
No, no. Remember what I was saying
last night about 12 rugged individualists?

53:39.072 --> 53:40.115
So?

53:40.741 --> 53:44.441
You heard them. It was "we ain't gonna
do this and we ain't gonna do that."

53:44.620 --> 53:47.111
When I asked them to step forward,
even Posey joined.

53:47.372 --> 53:50.457
I'll bet you he's been shaving
in cold water since he was a kid.

53:51.043 --> 53:52.751
Boy, do I love that Franko.

53:52.961 --> 53:58.169
That means that we are going to have
that much more time for work.

53:59.051 --> 54:00.093
Right?

54:01.094 --> 54:04.095
So now, if you...

54:04.306 --> 54:08.056
You "dirty dozen" have no objections...

54:09.646 --> 54:11.769
we will get our equipment...

54:12.273 --> 54:16.105
and we will start in right now.

54:18.571 --> 54:20.398
Attention!

54:25.704 --> 54:27.993
Ready, hut!

54:29.542 --> 54:31.534
That's very good.

54:31.877 --> 54:34.962
You look just like real soldiers.

54:35.548 --> 54:36.876
Fall out!

54:38.384 --> 54:40.175
Now, move it!

54:41.554 --> 54:45.136
You're still the dirtiest soldiers
in this man's army...

54:45.724 --> 54:47.966
and you're getting
filthier every day.

54:48.686 --> 54:50.844
But your training is almost over.

54:52.273 --> 54:55.274
In two days, you'll be learning
how to jump with a parachute...

54:55.442 --> 54:56.687
and you'll learn quick.

54:57.570 --> 55:00.405
This training will take place
at a regular Army base.

55:00.781 --> 55:05.324
And I just want to remind you
that this operation is secret.

55:05.536 --> 55:07.244
Top secret.

55:08.080 --> 55:11.829
You will not be wearing dog tags.
You will not say anything to anyone.

55:12.042 --> 55:14.284
Do you understand? Nothing.
Nothing!

55:15.087 --> 55:18.041
One word, one slip
from any one of you...

55:18.340 --> 55:20.499
and the deal is off!

55:20.926 --> 55:22.883
And you all know what that means,
right?

55:26.807 --> 55:28.385
All right, serve it up.

55:28.767 --> 55:30.262
All right, serve it up!

55:32.188 --> 55:35.225
Colonel Breed won't like this secrecy bit.
He'll want to know.

55:35.400 --> 55:38.650
- We're still top-priority, aren't we?
- You can't ignore his author...

55:38.862 --> 55:41.021
- Do we have the juice?
- Yes, but Colonel Br...

55:41.199 --> 55:43.950
Then I don't care
what Colonel Breed likes.

55:44.368 --> 55:47.322
Look, you're supposed to be
the liaison officer.

55:47.538 --> 55:49.910
I want you to get orders
to the highest echelon...

55:50.082 --> 55:52.408
stating to Colonel Everett
Dasher Breed...

55:52.585 --> 55:56.535
that a group, over which he will have
no authority, will be arriving Tuesday...

55:56.714 --> 56:01.091
and the identity of the men is secret.
Tell him we got a general with them...

56:01.302 --> 56:06.047
tell him anything you want, just get
that West Point bum off of my back.

56:06.933 --> 56:08.391
A general, huh?

56:09.477 --> 56:10.936
I'll see what I can do.

56:11.562 --> 56:14.100
- I know you will.
- Hey, Franko. What is it, man?

56:14.273 --> 56:16.681
- What kind of food is that?
- Pig face, serve it up!

56:16.859 --> 56:18.353
What is it?

56:19.070 --> 56:21.775
I don't know. I never ate
anything like this before.

56:21.989 --> 56:24.741
I've stepped in it a couple of times,
but I never ate it.

56:24.909 --> 56:25.952
What is it?

56:30.122 --> 56:31.747
Did you ask what general?

56:31.916 --> 56:33.576
Yes, sir. Got the same thing again.

56:33.793 --> 56:36.414
No information beyond
what was in the order.

56:38.005 --> 56:39.250
What about General Denton?

56:39.465 --> 56:43.249
When we first called, his extension
was busy. Now he's not there.

56:57.609 --> 56:58.985
Not now.

57:08.121 --> 57:10.493
- Well, what about you?
- Nothing, sir.

57:24.929 --> 57:26.507
Not now, you...

57:44.949 --> 57:46.360
I think they're coming.

57:46.576 --> 57:47.655
Yeah, it's them.

57:50.705 --> 57:53.955
Yes? Sir, they just passed
the checkpoint.

57:54.167 --> 57:55.542
Let's go.

57:59.797 --> 58:01.126
Now. Now!

58:13.895 --> 58:16.185
Sounds like we're running
into a party.

58:17.149 --> 58:19.605
Boy, you don't suppose
it's for us, do you?

58:46.054 --> 58:48.379
Present arms!

58:52.727 --> 58:54.387
Major Reisman reporting, sir.

58:57.190 --> 58:58.305
Where's the general?

59:03.363 --> 59:06.862
He's in the truck. But you understand
that he's traveling incognito.

59:09.703 --> 59:12.573
We thought he might care to inspect
our number one platoon.

59:12.914 --> 59:16.746
If you give me a moment,
I'll see if he's willing to do that.

59:17.752 --> 59:20.160
Order, halt!

59:22.424 --> 59:23.918
How come the band?

59:24.509 --> 59:27.427
- What are we waiting for?
- They're inspecting the guest list.

59:27.596 --> 59:30.003
- What guest list?
- What's the matter with you?

59:33.019 --> 59:34.845
Which one of you wants
to be a general?

59:35.021 --> 59:36.645
Be a what?

59:36.814 --> 59:38.059
Pinkley.

59:39.942 --> 59:41.982
What? What kind of a general, sir?

59:42.486 --> 59:46.235
Just a plain ordinary, everyday,
home-loving American general.

59:46.449 --> 59:48.157
I'd rather be a civilian, sir.

59:52.371 --> 59:53.486
What do I have to do?

59:53.706 --> 59:57.538
You've seen generals inspecting troops.
Just walk slow and act stupid.

59:57.752 --> 01:00:00.788
Up one rank, down the other,
and straight back to the truck.

01:00:01.214 --> 01:00:04.630
They're expecting a general,
and that's exactly what they'll get.

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.212
So let's go.

01:00:09.097 --> 01:00:11.968
- Move it. Come on, move it!
- Ten-hut!

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:14.265
Present arms!

01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:15.723
Move it.
Let's go, move it.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.863
Fall in!

01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:29.610
- Pinkley's gonna be a general.
- Why?

01:00:29.785 --> 01:00:31.694
- Pinkley's gonna be a general.
- What for?

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:32.913
Shut up and watch.

01:00:46.093 --> 01:00:48.762
First Platoon waiting for inspection, sir!

01:01:18.835 --> 01:01:22.619
They're very pretty, colonel.
Very pretty.

01:01:22.839 --> 01:01:24.962
- But can they fight?
- Yes, sir.

01:01:25.174 --> 01:01:26.717
I hope you're right.

01:01:31.264 --> 01:01:35.097
- Where are you from, son?
- Madison City, Missouri, sir.

01:01:37.813 --> 01:01:38.928
Never heard of it.

01:01:43.194 --> 01:01:46.563
All right, major, let's go. We got
work to do. Thank you, colonel.

01:01:59.335 --> 01:02:00.877
Hold it down. Hold it down.

01:02:05.883 --> 01:02:08.719
You pull a stunt like that again,
I'll beat your brains out.

01:02:08.887 --> 01:02:10.346
Major, you d...

01:02:12.432 --> 01:02:15.516
Sergeant, fall them into a column
of twos, then move out.

01:02:15.685 --> 01:02:20.264
Yes, sir. Fall out. Fall into column
of twos on me. Fall out!

01:02:41.169 --> 01:02:42.829
Reisman!

01:02:45.882 --> 01:02:49.298
Some people may consider you
a first-class officer.

01:02:49.761 --> 01:02:54.506
But as far as I'm concerned, you're
a disorganized, undisciplined clown.

01:02:54.724 --> 01:02:57.678
I'm gonna make it my business
to run you out of this Army.

01:02:57.894 --> 01:02:59.970
I owe you an apology, colonel.

01:03:00.188 --> 01:03:04.401
I always thought that you were a cold,
unimaginative, tight-lipped officer.

01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:09.605
But you're really quite emotional,
aren't you?

01:03:15.788 --> 01:03:17.745
Clayton, Blake.

01:03:24.923 --> 01:03:27.165
- Hey, watch it.
- Look out, will you?

01:03:27.426 --> 01:03:29.253
- Hey, hold this.
- All right, let's go!

01:03:29.469 --> 01:03:33.088
- Do you believe this guy?
- Okay, all right, we're coming!

01:03:34.933 --> 01:03:36.807
Come on, let's go!

01:03:48.822 --> 01:03:50.400
You're in the way.

01:03:52.451 --> 01:03:54.325
What's the matter with you guys?

01:03:54.536 --> 01:03:55.912
- Listen, buster.
- Hands off!

01:03:56.079 --> 01:03:57.122
Now, take it easy.

01:03:57.289 --> 01:04:00.373
- Just want to ask you a few questions.
- Questions, huh?

01:04:05.672 --> 01:04:07.131
Hold him! Hold him!

01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:12.170
You son of a...

01:04:12.721 --> 01:04:14.381
In the gut, so it don't show.

01:04:16.433 --> 01:04:17.808
That's the way!

01:04:21.939 --> 01:04:23.978
Talk, you bastard.
Who the hell are you?

01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:28.815
- Number Nine, you crumb.
- Number Nine?

01:04:28.987 --> 01:04:31.693
- You gonna tell us or not?
- Go to hell.

01:04:32.825 --> 01:04:33.988
Hold him.

01:04:36.162 --> 01:04:38.155
Where the hell are your dog tags?

01:04:39.832 --> 01:04:42.503
- I ate them.
- You ate them?

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:46.124
- You gonna tell us now?
- Yeah.

01:04:46.632 --> 01:04:47.675
Yeah.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.761
- Number Nine!
- Wladislaw!

01:05:19.373 --> 01:05:20.653
What happened?

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:25.662
They tried to make me talk.

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:38.348
Where the hell have you been?

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:41.644
- Wait. What happened to him?
- He slipped on a bar of soap.

01:05:41.854 --> 01:05:43.562
Everybody's slipping on soap.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:45.604
Of all the miserable...

01:05:47.568 --> 01:05:49.110
- Who?
- Who? Reisman.

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:51.152
He had a couple
of those paras jump him.

01:05:51.363 --> 01:05:53.689
- Major did this?
- Gave him a pretty hard time.

01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:55.817
- Well?
- Well, what?

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.578
Did he tell them anything?

01:05:58.246 --> 01:05:59.361
Are you crazy?

01:05:59.748 --> 01:06:01.576
Three wise men.

01:06:01.918 --> 01:06:05.369
"Trust your major."
I'd rather trust Hitler.

01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:10.421
- All right, move it out.
- Come on, move it! Move it!

01:06:17.767 --> 01:06:20.436
You'll find this easier
than our jump-tower training.

01:06:20.603 --> 01:06:23.308
Action stations!

01:06:25.733 --> 01:06:26.776
Go!

01:07:08.234 --> 01:07:09.277
Morgan.

01:07:09.485 --> 01:07:11.810
- Yes, sir.
- They should be here any minute now.

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:14.236
Get the men together.
I'll talk to them first.

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:16.608
- We'll use your hut tonight.
- Our hut?

01:07:16.785 --> 01:07:17.828
Your hut.

01:07:18.036 --> 01:07:20.492
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

01:07:20.664 --> 01:07:22.158
All right, Ike and Mike.

01:07:22.332 --> 01:07:25.832
Come on, get on your feet.
Come on, let's go.

01:07:26.003 --> 01:07:27.045
Move it!

01:07:27.588 --> 01:07:29.664
What are you, the Gold Dust Twins?

01:07:33.428 --> 01:07:35.301
What, you need a special invitation?

01:07:35.471 --> 01:07:36.514
- No, sir.
- No, sir?

01:07:36.681 --> 01:07:38.638
- I mean, yes, sir.
- Then move it.

01:07:41.519 --> 01:07:45.018
That's TS, Greek.
Why don't you tell it to the chaplain?

01:07:46.566 --> 01:07:49.686
All right, you foul-ups, come on!
Get over to the MP hut.

01:07:49.903 --> 01:07:52.476
The man wants to talk to you.
Come on, move it!

01:07:52.697 --> 01:07:54.191
All right.

01:07:54.866 --> 01:07:55.909
Stop pushing.

01:07:57.202 --> 01:07:59.871
Come on, off it now. Let's get going!

01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:03.453
So this is how the other half lives.

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:05.458
Get going!

01:08:05.877 --> 01:08:08.119
Hey, we're not going
to the junior prom.

01:08:08.338 --> 01:08:11.292
- Pretty sweet, huh?
- No dancing. Come on, let's go!

01:08:14.093 --> 01:08:16.086
- They got electricity.
- Nice to be rich.

01:08:16.304 --> 01:08:18.629
- Hey, what does he want to see us for?
- A radio.

01:08:18.848 --> 01:08:20.721
- A radio?
- Hey, look at those pictures.

01:08:20.892 --> 01:08:22.386
Maybe the guards are lonesome.

01:08:22.602 --> 01:08:25.603
- Horny bunch of mothers.
- Wow!

01:08:28.441 --> 01:08:30.765
All right, give them
a little air, boys.

01:08:31.778 --> 01:08:33.522
Move it, Jiminez.

01:08:45.084 --> 01:08:46.626
Okay, sarge.

01:09:14.406 --> 01:09:17.822
Well, jump school didn't kill you.
Maybe that stuff will.

01:09:18.158 --> 01:09:21.326
Your training's about over
and I figure that entitles you...

01:09:21.537 --> 01:09:25.915
to a graduation ball or something.
You have cups and glasses.

01:09:28.712 --> 01:09:30.254
All right, wheel them in.

01:09:45.145 --> 01:09:47.184
Shall I say they're
with your compliments?

01:09:47.354 --> 01:09:49.645
Hell, no.
Tell them it's part of their training.

01:09:49.817 --> 01:09:50.859
Yes, sir.

01:09:51.068 --> 01:09:52.349
Where are we?

01:09:52.528 --> 01:09:55.399
Oh! Somebody in this truck
has a cold nose.

01:09:55.615 --> 01:09:57.358
Get off me foot!

01:09:57.575 --> 01:10:00.066
Watch yourself, baby.

01:10:00.786 --> 01:10:03.028
- Have you hurt yourself?
- It's a limey barrack!

01:10:03.206 --> 01:10:05.447
I'm not one for orgies meself.

01:10:05.666 --> 01:10:08.786
- Should've asked for more money.
- Bitch.

01:10:09.295 --> 01:10:11.797
You sadists!

01:10:12.131 --> 01:10:15.963
- Good evening.
- I'm already too worn out to work.

01:10:16.636 --> 01:10:19.008
- Right this way, ladies.
- Move along. That's nice.

01:10:19.222 --> 01:10:20.680
Good evening, major.

01:10:22.308 --> 01:10:26.886
I could only get eight, sir. It's like cops.
If you want one, you can't find them.

01:10:27.063 --> 01:10:29.602
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, admiral.

01:10:34.404 --> 01:10:37.074
Blimey, they're filthy!

01:10:37.241 --> 01:10:40.195
They may be, lady,
but they sure do mean well.

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:41.453
Hey!

01:10:42.329 --> 01:10:45.116
All present and accounted for, major.

01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:52.411
You gentlemen will be on duty again
at 0600 hours in the morning.

01:10:52.756 --> 01:10:55.045
That's, oddly enough, the same
amount of time...

01:10:55.217 --> 01:10:58.218
that these young ladies have allotted
to be your guests.

01:10:58.679 --> 01:11:03.305
In the meantime, I suggest that
you use that time to get acquainted.

01:11:04.017 --> 01:11:06.723
I don't believe that Mr. Maggott
would care to indulge...

01:11:06.938 --> 01:11:10.473
so I suggest you save some whiskey
for him when he gets off of duty.

01:11:10.858 --> 01:11:12.602
Good night, gentlemen. Ladies.

01:11:12.819 --> 01:11:14.646
Good night, colonel.

01:11:17.365 --> 01:11:20.034
- Are you crazy?
- Let's go. We might inhibit them.

01:11:20.869 --> 01:11:23.442
- You want to bet?
- Major!

01:11:23.663 --> 01:11:26.201
Yes, you, Major Reisman!

01:11:26.416 --> 01:11:29.121
I saw those filthy strumpets!

01:11:29.335 --> 01:11:32.954
You're turning this place
into a bottomless pit of vice!

01:11:33.298 --> 01:11:35.836
Comes Judgment Day!

01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:38.802
And Judgment Day is coming!

01:11:39.804 --> 01:11:42.805
Those men, major, they'll suffer
eternal damnation...

01:11:42.974 --> 01:11:44.516
because of you, major!

01:11:44.726 --> 01:11:47.976
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

01:11:48.187 --> 01:11:50.394
You're on guard duty, Maggott.

01:13:12.607 --> 01:13:13.888
Want to dance?

01:13:14.109 --> 01:13:15.852
There's no music.

01:13:16.653 --> 01:13:18.112
Try humming.

01:13:23.869 --> 01:13:26.442
All right, girls,
you want to lose those wraps?

01:13:27.747 --> 01:13:30.074
- Put on that radio.
- Make yourself at home.

01:13:31.252 --> 01:13:34.169
You think those guys realize
tomorrow's Mother's Day?

01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:35.745
Is it?

01:13:42.156 --> 01:13:44.315
Now they're doing it to music.

01:14:03.553 --> 01:14:06.470
- This is a restricted area, sir.
- I know that.

01:14:06.681 --> 01:14:08.175
Two groups, three ranks in.

01:14:08.391 --> 01:14:09.470
Open the gate.

01:14:09.767 --> 01:14:11.262
Come on, let's move it!

01:14:11.477 --> 01:14:13.185
Open this gate.

01:14:13.605 --> 01:14:14.767
Yes, sir.

01:14:19.277 --> 01:14:20.605
Hey, look at those guys.

01:14:21.529 --> 01:14:23.438
You can't come in here, sir!

01:14:23.656 --> 01:14:26.028
Sergeant, take his weapon.

01:14:26.743 --> 01:14:28.154
Take his weapon.

01:14:29.829 --> 01:14:33.578
Corporal Morgan. Sergeant, get that
rabble in some kind of order.

01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:35.831
Yes, sir. Commander, man to man!

01:14:36.044 --> 01:14:38.535
Sir, you are contravening
a direct order.

01:14:38.755 --> 01:14:39.917
Contravening nothing!

01:14:40.381 --> 01:14:43.169
Fall in with the rest and
speak when you're spoken to.

01:14:43.384 --> 01:14:45.840
You heard what the colonel said.
Fall in!

01:14:46.304 --> 01:14:47.846
Come on, move it!

01:14:49.682 --> 01:14:51.805
All right, you heard what he said.
Fall in!

01:14:51.976 --> 01:14:54.894
Come on, come on!
Let's get the lead out.

01:14:55.313 --> 01:14:56.807
What's he all upset about?

01:14:56.981 --> 01:14:59.937
All right, you bunch of foul-ups.
Come on. Grab a formation.

01:15:00.153 --> 01:15:03.154
Fall in there!
Come on, you yard birds!

01:15:03.323 --> 01:15:05.648
You believe this Army?
We gotta be losing.

01:15:05.825 --> 01:15:08.779
Move it! What's wrong with you?
You got lead in them?

01:15:09.329 --> 01:15:10.788
Come on, get going!

01:15:10.997 --> 01:15:14.497
Hey, ain't those the jokers that
roughed you up in the latrine?

01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:16.168
Come on!

01:15:16.503 --> 01:15:17.748
Hey, come on, pick it up!

01:15:18.839 --> 01:15:21.590
Yeah, we had Reisman all wrong.

01:15:21.758 --> 01:15:24.712
- Come on, move it!
- Not now. Wait for it.

01:15:26.555 --> 01:15:28.346
What's going on up there?

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:30.845
Hey, you!
What are you, something special?

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:34.226
We gotta wait all day for you?
Come on!

01:15:35.605 --> 01:15:39.105
Get in position there.
Let's try and make a straight line.

01:15:39.276 --> 01:15:40.936
Let's look like soldiers, huh?

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:48.024
I told you nobody could pass.
Now, open the gate. Let's get going.

01:15:52.289 --> 01:15:55.622
Those are the two guys
that got Wladislaw.

01:15:56.710 --> 01:15:59.746
Those are the two guys that
gave Wladislaw his lumps.

01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:03.204
Those are the two guys
that jumped Wladislaw.

01:16:03.967 --> 01:16:06.423
Those are the two guys
that banged Wladislaw.

01:16:06.636 --> 01:16:09.471
Those two gorillas beat up Wladislaw.

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.307
Those are the two guys...

01:16:31.121 --> 01:16:32.699
In my opinion...

01:16:33.248 --> 01:16:37.080
the officer in command
of this operation...

01:16:37.294 --> 01:16:42.003
has either disregarded his orders
or is flagrantly disobeying them...

01:16:42.508 --> 01:16:44.085
one way or the other.

01:16:44.426 --> 01:16:46.964
And that is what I am here to find out.

01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:49.924
All right...

01:16:51.767 --> 01:16:55.599
gentlemen,
let's understand each other.

01:16:56.939 --> 01:16:59.774
I'm here to find out exactly
what this is all about...

01:16:59.942 --> 01:17:03.441
and I intend to do it
if it takes all day.

01:17:04.404 --> 01:17:07.773
Now, you can make it easy or tough
on yourself. That's up to you.

01:17:09.368 --> 01:17:13.946
Before I leave, we're going to find
out who's involved in this insanity...

01:17:14.456 --> 01:17:17.291
what you're doing here and why.

01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.120
Is that understood?

01:17:22.297 --> 01:17:23.957
All right, general.

01:17:28.554 --> 01:17:30.760
What's your name, rank
and serial number?

01:17:30.931 --> 01:17:32.510
You tell him, we've all had it!

01:17:32.684 --> 01:17:33.935
Quiet!

01:17:36.896 --> 01:17:39.019
What's your name, soldier?

01:17:39.232 --> 01:17:41.687
Number Two, sir.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.900
Morgan. Clayton.

01:17:49.701 --> 01:17:50.981
Yes, sir?

01:17:51.661 --> 01:17:55.244
Give Clayton this man's name, rank
and serial number. For all of them.

01:17:55.415 --> 01:17:58.452
- I really don't know that, sir.
- Then tell him what you do know.

01:17:58.669 --> 01:18:00.247
You fink, you tell him nothing!

01:18:00.462 --> 01:18:03.499
- What was that talk down there?
- Nothing, sir.

01:18:05.134 --> 01:18:06.794
Come here, soldier.

01:18:23.194 --> 01:18:24.652
When did you bathe last?

01:18:26.447 --> 01:18:28.938
- I don't remember, sir.
- You're filthy.

01:18:29.909 --> 01:18:32.032
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

01:18:32.369 --> 01:18:34.445
Sergeant Fredericks,
get a razor and water.

01:18:34.747 --> 01:18:38.791
He will demonstrate proper procedure
for shaving and bathing in the field.

01:18:38.959 --> 01:18:40.952
- Yes, sir.
- Right, soldier?

01:18:41.128 --> 01:18:42.622
No, sir!

01:18:43.214 --> 01:18:44.293
No, sir, what?

01:18:44.465 --> 01:18:47.715
No, sir, I am not going to shave, sir!

01:18:47.927 --> 01:18:52.388
Then we'll have to do it the hard way.
Clayton, Blake, dry-shave him.

01:18:53.433 --> 01:18:54.476
Now!

01:19:09.282 --> 01:19:11.524
- Reisman!
- That's right!

01:19:12.077 --> 01:19:14.994
You be good enough to have your
men dispose of their weapons!

01:19:15.205 --> 01:19:17.910
- Sergeant Bowren!
- Sir!

01:19:18.166 --> 01:19:21.452
Get some special help
and get those weapons!

01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:24.540
Yes, sir.
All right, you heard the man!

01:19:24.756 --> 01:19:26.037
Now, get moving!

01:19:26.259 --> 01:19:28.216
Hit them only where it hurts.

01:19:29.929 --> 01:19:32.052
- Turn it loose!
- That's great.

01:19:32.265 --> 01:19:34.553
Oh, I'm sorry, sergeant.

01:19:34.767 --> 01:19:36.345
You Nazi!

01:19:55.997 --> 01:19:57.870
I'm with you, major, all the way.

01:20:05.089 --> 01:20:07.581
Don't call us, we'll call you.

01:20:08.302 --> 01:20:10.294
You must be out of your mind.

01:20:10.512 --> 01:20:12.386
It might seem that way.

01:20:17.144 --> 01:20:20.347
Take it all back, colonel.
They aren't pretty and they can't fight.

01:20:20.564 --> 01:20:21.727
They're all 4-Fs!

01:20:21.899 --> 01:20:24.899
Hey, colonel, I hear they
don't even use parachutes!

01:20:30.324 --> 01:20:32.316
Hey, colonel, you crybaby!

01:20:34.077 --> 01:20:36.070
Don't just stand there, pick it up!

01:20:36.246 --> 01:20:38.868
- Stick around for tea.
- Put some money in there.

01:20:39.082 --> 01:20:40.541
Come again, colonel!

01:20:40.751 --> 01:20:43.242
Stop by any time, bozo.

01:20:45.255 --> 01:20:49.087
I'm sure you look upon your service
record as being highly colorful, major.

01:20:49.259 --> 01:20:51.299
Well, that's not my view of it.

01:20:51.929 --> 01:20:55.262
I think you know I was never in favor
of you leading this operation.

01:20:55.432 --> 01:20:58.220
So I can't say that I'm disappointed
in your performance.

01:20:58.436 --> 01:21:02.304
Because the impression you made on
me was unfavorable in the first place.

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:05.764
You behave as if this
were a personal matter.

01:21:06.402 --> 01:21:08.194
Let me assure you, it isn't.

01:21:08.404 --> 01:21:11.608
What happens to you is something
to which I am indifferent.

01:21:11.824 --> 01:21:14.612
But the nature of the operation
I am running is not.

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:18.454
Colonel Breed's report
on your unit's level of achievement...

01:21:18.623 --> 01:21:22.455
and general behavior at the parachute
training school is entirely negative.

01:21:22.627 --> 01:21:24.834
It would in itself justify
my recommendation...

01:21:25.005 --> 01:21:26.879
that this operation be canceled.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:30.291
Your men will be sent back
for execution of sentence.

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:34.591
Whether disciplinary action
should be taken against you...

01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:36.681
is a matter for General Worden here.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:40.513
I take it you don't deny your
responsibility for the fact that...

01:21:40.688 --> 01:21:44.816
on the night of April 14-15, a military
establishment of the U.S. Army...

01:21:44.984 --> 01:21:46.810
was the scene of a drunken party...

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:50.479
at which no less than seven
female civilians took an active part.

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:53.491
Oh, yes, sir, they took
an active part all right.

01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:56.530
Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:21:57.329 --> 01:22:00.864
Are you in a position to offer even
the remotest mitigating circumstances?

01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:03.532
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, sergeant, more ice.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:04.832
Yes, sir.

01:22:05.462 --> 01:22:06.505
Well?

01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:10.838
You offered those men a chance to get
off the hook, and they worked hard.

01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:14.966
Now that they're just shaping up, you're
gonna say, "Sorry, the deal's off"?

01:22:15.389 --> 01:22:19.007
You've only yourself to blame for that.
You brought those women to camp.

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:20.685
So I broke an Army regulation.

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:23.889
You're gonna kill five men
and send the rest to prison for life?

01:22:24.064 --> 01:22:26.141
Because if you did that...

01:22:26.359 --> 01:22:30.143
you'd have to lock up half
the U.S. Army, officers included.

01:22:30.322 --> 01:22:32.480
Anyway, you said it yourself,
it was my fault.

01:22:32.657 --> 01:22:35.029
It's not gonna affect their ability
as soldiers.

01:22:35.202 --> 01:22:38.820
Yes, well, we've heard about their
ability as soldiers from Colonel Breed.

01:22:39.206 --> 01:22:40.617
That's his opinion.

01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:44.831
My men have crammed six months of
intensive training into as many weeks.

01:22:45.046 --> 01:22:48.331
As of this moment, I'd stack them
up against any men in the Army.

01:22:48.758 --> 01:22:50.335
You can't be serious.

01:22:50.551 --> 01:22:53.125
You're damn right I am!
They might not be pretty...

01:22:53.346 --> 01:22:55.718
but any one of mine
is worth 10 of yours.

01:22:55.932 --> 01:22:59.135
- Those comparisons are hardly the point.
- It's precisely the point.

01:22:59.352 --> 01:23:03.017
My contention is that my men are more
than able to handle any job given them.

01:23:03.523 --> 01:23:06.892
Now, you gentlemen set this thing up.
You promised them a chance.

01:23:07.068 --> 01:23:09.903
At least you can let them
show you what they're capable of.

01:23:10.071 --> 01:23:12.396
I shudder to think
what they might be capable of.

01:23:12.573 --> 01:23:16.405
Give them a chance to prove it, then
if they fail, your conscience is clear.

01:23:17.245 --> 01:23:18.869
Tell me, major...

01:23:19.705 --> 01:23:22.955
just how would you
have your men prove it?

01:23:25.586 --> 01:23:26.962
It can't be done, can it?

01:23:34.136 --> 01:23:36.343
Well, yes. I suppose it could.

01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:39.133
I mean, there might be a way.

01:23:40.268 --> 01:23:42.593
What I mean is,
general, if you recall...

01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:45.522
next week we've got divisional
maneuvers in Devonshire.

01:23:45.731 --> 01:23:46.894
Yes, yes, yes.

01:23:47.108 --> 01:23:50.393
Colonel Breed's outfit will be
part of that exercise.

01:23:50.903 --> 01:23:53.690
As a matter of fact,
one of his companies...

01:23:53.906 --> 01:23:57.953
has been assigned the defense
of divisional headquarters.

01:23:58.162 --> 01:23:59.205
So?

01:24:01.291 --> 01:24:02.333
So...

01:24:02.959 --> 01:24:07.870
So you let my 12 men act
as an independent unit...

01:24:08.089 --> 01:24:10.212
attached to the opposing force.

01:24:11.634 --> 01:24:15.252
And they'll knock out Breed's
headquarters and capture his entire staff.

01:24:17.473 --> 01:24:18.802
That I'd like to see.

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.057
So would I.

01:24:45.126 --> 01:24:48.162
Charlie and Fox Companies will support
the back of the woods.

01:24:48.379 --> 01:24:50.586
They'll need supplies
from the 2nd Battalion.

01:24:50.757 --> 01:24:53.592
Rogers won't like that,
but I don't want to hear about it.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.002
- Yes, sir.
- How's Johnson's armor?

01:24:56.221 --> 01:24:59.506
They just ran through two minutes ago,
sir. The armor's all set.

01:25:07.899 --> 01:25:08.942
Hold it!

01:25:11.402 --> 01:25:12.445
Back!

01:25:15.741 --> 01:25:16.784
Change!

01:25:36.429 --> 01:25:38.339
You think we're gonna
get away with this?

01:25:38.807 --> 01:25:43.220
Smile, you idiots! If those blue
slobs recognize us, we're in trouble.

01:26:02.205 --> 01:26:05.408
Can you believe it?
They shaved.

01:26:05.584 --> 01:26:07.457
How about that?

01:26:07.836 --> 01:26:10.790
Get a load of the major.
He can't believe we made it.

01:26:11.006 --> 01:26:14.256
- The day go fast, major?
- You're beautiful, but you're late.

01:26:14.467 --> 01:26:16.507
- Got everything you need?
- Absolutely.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.796
Think you can remember the plan?

01:26:19.264 --> 01:26:21.553
- So where'd you get the vehicle?
- We stole it.

01:26:21.766 --> 01:26:24.174
Like we're gonna steal
everything else.

01:26:24.352 --> 01:26:27.022
We're playing war games, right?
Anything else, sir?

01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:30.854
I guess not. All right, we'll be
with the generals at headquarters.

01:26:31.067 --> 01:26:34.022
From now on, you're on your own.
So take off and good luck.

01:26:34.447 --> 01:26:35.941
Let's move!

01:26:38.034 --> 01:26:40.026
All right, split up into three groups.

01:26:54.218 --> 01:26:56.127
These two belong to you?

01:27:12.152 --> 01:27:13.527
Where's General Worden?

01:27:13.737 --> 01:27:16.109
Well, he's gone to check up
in the field, sir.

01:27:17.407 --> 01:27:19.115
Oh, my God.

01:27:27.167 --> 01:27:29.954
- Well?
- Be with you in a minute, sir.

01:27:34.758 --> 01:27:38.672
- Well, how about this one?
- Yes, sir. I think that's it, sir.

01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:43.929
Oh, that's excellent,
Haskell, excellent!

01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:46.138
Come on, let's go.

01:28:04.122 --> 01:28:06.114
- We made it.
- Where are the others?

01:28:06.291 --> 01:28:09.208
8:45. Four of them ought to be
coming over that ridge soon.

01:28:09.419 --> 01:28:12.124
0845? They'd better
be coming fast then.

01:28:12.297 --> 01:28:16.081
The enemy is gonna lay a live barrage on
that ridge at 0850. Did you know that?

01:28:16.301 --> 01:28:17.711
Yes, sir, I knew that.

01:28:17.927 --> 01:28:21.296
But that's the one direction Colonel
Breed won't be looking for them.

01:28:23.976 --> 01:28:26.549
- Are they all set?
- All set, sir.

01:28:26.770 --> 01:28:30.270
Batteries one, three and four,
open fire and continue at will.

01:28:30.482 --> 01:28:34.314
Batteries one, three and four,
open fire and continue at will.

01:28:34.486 --> 01:28:36.064
Batteries one, three and four...

01:28:38.991 --> 01:28:40.242
Ready!

01:28:40.868 --> 01:28:41.911
Aim!

01:28:42.578 --> 01:28:43.621
Fire!

01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:51.784
Come on!

01:28:52.004 --> 01:28:54.412
Let's go! Come on!

01:29:09.564 --> 01:29:10.607
Load!

01:29:13.485 --> 01:29:14.528
Now, come on!

01:29:14.694 --> 01:29:17.529
- While they're reloading!
- Let's go!

01:29:19.366 --> 01:29:22.153
- Down! Can't you hear it?!
- Hit it!

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:41.595
Secure guards!

01:29:41.805 --> 01:29:43.844
All right, let's go!

01:29:50.814 --> 01:29:51.893
Let's go.

01:29:59.615 --> 01:30:01.822
Now, what the hell were you
guys waiting for?

01:30:02.034 --> 01:30:05.569
What do you m...?
Mean, boy?

01:30:07.206 --> 01:30:10.540
Those lovers were trying
to kill us back there.

01:30:12.587 --> 01:30:14.046
Change.

01:30:15.006 --> 01:30:17.675
Change? What do you mean, "change"?

01:30:18.426 --> 01:30:19.505
You can't do that!

01:30:19.719 --> 01:30:22.838
It's all right, major.
We're gonna change back later.

01:30:23.389 --> 01:30:25.347
They can't stop us now.

01:30:25.851 --> 01:30:27.179
Let's go.

01:30:27.728 --> 01:30:29.396
Come on.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.523
We're on our way.

01:30:42.159 --> 01:30:44.566
We get across this road, take 10.

01:30:53.378 --> 01:30:55.122
What are we waiting here for?

01:30:55.547 --> 01:30:58.169
For a jeep, a heavy machine gun
and four men.

01:31:01.303 --> 01:31:02.466
Like this one?

01:31:03.263 --> 01:31:04.306
Slow down.

01:31:05.015 --> 01:31:06.474
Ten-hut!

01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:15.691
Good afternoon, general.

01:31:25.411 --> 01:31:27.119
The Mafia has landed!

01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:29.561
- Whatever Franko says, Franko does!
- Machine gun.

01:31:29.666 --> 01:31:31.374
Let's get it out. Move it out.

01:31:31.584 --> 01:31:33.493
- Come on, snap it up.
- Franko, out!

01:31:34.045 --> 01:31:36.002
Out? What do you mean, "out"?

01:31:36.172 --> 01:31:39.173
- Who do you think stole this thing?
- You did, my boy.

01:31:39.676 --> 01:31:43.924
Look, you and Pinkley are the only guys
that Colonel Breed got a good look at.

01:31:44.181 --> 01:31:47.182
This operation is a big enough risk
without you coming along.

01:31:47.351 --> 01:31:49.640
- Out.
- Come on, Franko.

01:31:51.188 --> 01:31:54.106
Jefferson, you have until 0930
to show up with the ambulance.

01:31:54.316 --> 01:31:56.523
You don't make it,
I'll figure you got nailed.

01:31:56.694 --> 01:31:58.935
- Then we'll take a whack at plan B.
- Right.

01:32:00.072 --> 01:32:01.815
So long, major.

01:32:04.577 --> 01:32:06.865
Hold on, Maggott.
Don't want to lose you now.

01:32:09.373 --> 01:32:11.413
Attention!

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:14.335
Attention.

01:32:16.297 --> 01:32:17.339
Ten-hut!

01:32:20.050 --> 01:32:22.376
- Morning, Breed.
- Morning. Quite a surprise.

01:32:22.553 --> 01:32:25.554
- Everything under control?
- I think you could say that, sir.

01:32:25.723 --> 01:32:28.593
Good, good.
At ease, gentlemen, at ease.

01:32:28.809 --> 01:32:32.095
Just thought I'd drop by to see
how things are shaping up.

01:32:32.396 --> 01:32:34.852
So this is what it looks like, huh?

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:42.028
Come on, push!

01:32:45.618 --> 01:32:48.239
- Posey, remember, you're hurt.
- Oh, I'm dying.

01:32:48.454 --> 01:32:49.616
Come on, Maggott.

01:32:52.083 --> 01:32:53.661
Stand back, now.

01:33:03.846 --> 01:33:05.969
- What's that?
- Over there!

01:33:08.059 --> 01:33:11.428
- What was that?
- Down the road, sir. See that smoke?

01:33:11.687 --> 01:33:14.558
- Sergeant, have somebody take a look.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:14.774 --> 01:33:18.059
- What are they doing around that ridge?
- I don't know, sir.

01:33:18.277 --> 01:33:21.693
That should've been cleared
half an hour ago.

01:33:21.906 --> 01:33:25.191
Now, colonel, it sure doesn't look like
it's been cleared, does it?

01:33:25.368 --> 01:33:26.410
Let's go.

01:33:31.290 --> 01:33:34.790
- Posey, remember, you're injured.
- Gilpin, you forgot the ketchup.

01:33:34.961 --> 01:33:36.870
- Help!
- Come on.

01:33:53.104 --> 01:33:54.146
Sir?

01:33:57.483 --> 01:34:00.484
We got a man that's hurt bad.
We'd like to call an ambulance.

01:34:00.653 --> 01:34:02.610
Call an ambulance.
Go see what happened.

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:05.615
- Yes, sir. Come on, you two.
- Private?

01:34:05.992 --> 01:34:08.031
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

01:34:08.244 --> 01:34:09.904
What were you doing on that road?

01:34:10.121 --> 01:34:12.327
Our jeep got a flat tire.
We went into a ditch.

01:34:13.416 --> 01:34:17.331
I didn't ask you that. I asked you
what you were doing on that road.

01:34:17.504 --> 01:34:19.663
Spotting for the Field Artillery, sir.

01:34:24.554 --> 01:34:25.633
Let's see that map.

01:34:25.805 --> 01:34:27.347
Move Able, Charlie Company to...

01:34:27.557 --> 01:34:29.431
the bridge under smoke screen.

01:34:29.642 --> 01:34:33.854
Baker Company bank towards
the ridge at 1420 hours.

01:34:34.022 --> 01:34:37.355
- Private. Come here.
- Yes, sir.

01:34:39.652 --> 01:34:41.063
What's your name and outfit?

01:34:41.279 --> 01:34:42.738
Private Matthew Donald, sir.

01:34:42.947 --> 01:34:47.942
Serial number 726256.
Battery B, 526th Field Artillery, sir.

01:34:48.161 --> 01:34:51.162
- Where are your orders?
- Right here, sir.

01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:55.032
From Captain Thornhill, sir.

01:34:58.046 --> 01:35:00.881
I know most of the men
under my command.

01:35:02.217 --> 01:35:04.126
But I don't recall seeing you before.

01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:07.428
No, sir.
I was transferred in last week, sir.

01:35:11.643 --> 01:35:15.687
We're getting congested at point B.
Two forces have mined the road.

01:35:15.855 --> 01:35:17.433
- Where's Peterson?
- Here it comes!

01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:23.730
Clear the way!

01:35:24.155 --> 01:35:25.566
Looks like somebody got hurt.

01:35:28.743 --> 01:35:30.321
Watch it there!

01:35:31.579 --> 01:35:34.071
Okay, let's have some help
with this soldier.

01:35:35.668 --> 01:35:38.871
Count of three, lift. One, two, lift.

01:35:40.256 --> 01:35:41.750
Take it easy now.

01:35:44.218 --> 01:35:47.088
- Where do we put him, sir?
- Put him there.

01:35:49.848 --> 01:35:53.468
- You can stay, but keep out of the way.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

01:36:22.799 --> 01:36:25.373
Sorry, but this is the end
of the line for you.

01:36:25.594 --> 01:36:27.752
But we got a bad accident
down here, sir.

01:36:27.971 --> 01:36:31.885
That's too bad, because you just
became prisoners of war.

01:36:35.896 --> 01:36:37.141
It's the enemy, sir!

01:36:37.439 --> 01:36:39.266
All right, come on, let's go.

01:36:40.650 --> 01:36:42.394
Let's go, let's go.

01:36:44.529 --> 01:36:46.189
They can't do that.

01:36:48.909 --> 01:36:50.570
You're wearing Red Force insignia.

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.445
That's right. We're traitors.

01:36:53.623 --> 01:36:56.161
- Watch my finger.
- They use real bullets, you idiot!

01:36:56.375 --> 01:36:58.202
Now, look here, I'm a doctor, major.

01:36:58.419 --> 01:37:00.708
And I'm a major, captain.

01:37:00.922 --> 01:37:04.504
Yes, sir, but we had a radio message.
There's a man badly hurt down there.

01:37:04.675 --> 01:37:05.718
Hurry it up!

01:37:05.927 --> 01:37:08.678
Here's our permission to cross
all lines and roadblocks.

01:37:09.305 --> 01:37:12.756
Very cute idea, captain.
But it won't work. Get out.

01:37:13.142 --> 01:37:16.891
But it's not a gag, sir.
There's a real casualty there.

01:37:17.104 --> 01:37:18.515
All set back here, Jefferson.

01:37:18.731 --> 01:37:21.021
Sir, will you explain
the rules to him?

01:37:21.235 --> 01:37:22.314
The man may be dying.

01:37:22.527 --> 01:37:25.149
I'm just an observer, captain,
not an umpire.

01:37:25.364 --> 01:37:27.937
I can't interfere
or make any rulings.

01:37:28.534 --> 01:37:30.941
Come on, doc,
I've got a sick tree back here.

01:37:31.161 --> 01:37:32.821
Come on, you too.

01:37:33.038 --> 01:37:36.372
She's blond, she's engaged.
Come on, sugar!

01:37:36.583 --> 01:37:39.703
- Got your bracelet right here.
- What's the matter?

01:37:39.878 --> 01:37:42.416
Come on, Little Red Riding Hood.

01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:45.298
You're really gonna enjoy this.

01:37:48.053 --> 01:37:49.880
How about this patient, huh, doc?

01:37:50.847 --> 01:37:53.089
You're really gonna enjoy it here, doc.

01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:54.844
Come on, men. What about 0930?

01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:57.895
All right, take out the blue bands.
Let's go!

01:37:58.105 --> 01:37:59.563
Change to the blue armband!

01:37:59.731 --> 01:38:00.894
What about the prisoners?

01:38:01.108 --> 01:38:04.726
Sorry, major. We can't spare any men
to look after prisoners.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.602
You coming?

01:38:25.717 --> 01:38:28.255
- Is he trying to kill us?
- We must be going 120.

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:30.379
He's gonna squash us
in this sardine can.

01:38:30.597 --> 01:38:33.052
You want to be there by 0930,
don't you?

01:38:33.224 --> 01:38:34.267
Yeah.

01:38:35.143 --> 01:38:39.223
- Pulling back the map reference,
397492.

01:38:39.439 --> 01:38:40.767
That's Blue Force crew.

01:38:41.733 --> 01:38:44.852
Call in company orders and hit them
when they reach crossroads.

01:38:45.069 --> 01:38:46.267
Hello, Able 3.

01:38:46.487 --> 01:38:49.275
Don't worry, Bill. They called
for the ambulance.

01:39:03.214 --> 01:39:06.131
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yes, it will.

01:39:07.635 --> 01:39:09.461
It's gonna be all right.

01:39:09.678 --> 01:39:13.593
I want a strike on Hill 80
between them at 1400 hours.

01:39:13.766 --> 01:39:16.932
Move them up to the base of the hill
and keep their heads down.

01:39:17.144 --> 01:39:21.806
Well, thanks very much, colonel.
It's been very instructive.

01:39:21.982 --> 01:39:25.186
I think I'll take a little ride now
and get the overall picture.

01:39:25.403 --> 01:39:27.147
Yes, sir, thank you.

01:39:37.624 --> 01:39:39.498
Move it over. Give them room.

01:40:20.501 --> 01:40:23.336
Forward observation report.
Blue Force tanks approaching...

01:40:23.504 --> 01:40:25.378
airfield at map reference...

01:40:26.591 --> 01:40:27.966
Out of the way!

01:40:30.094 --> 01:40:31.553
Out of the way!

01:40:36.934 --> 01:40:38.642
Come on.
Watch out for the ambulance!

01:40:47.905 --> 01:40:50.775
There he is. The old man.

01:40:54.995 --> 01:40:56.573
Come on, observers!

01:41:07.424 --> 01:41:09.333
Major Reisman's compliments, sir.

01:41:18.018 --> 01:41:22.644
Hey, major. What do you think
about that one, major?

01:41:22.814 --> 01:41:26.598
I didn't wanna tell you before because
I thought it might make you nervous.

01:41:26.777 --> 01:41:29.943
After our last little party,
the generals were all in favor...

01:41:30.155 --> 01:41:32.444
of sending you back to finish
your sentences.

01:41:32.658 --> 01:41:34.615
- Or get hung.
- Or get hung.

01:41:34.785 --> 01:41:35.827
Or get hung.

01:41:36.328 --> 01:41:38.237
But I made a deal with them.

01:41:38.622 --> 01:41:42.667
Knocking off Breed's headquarters
is what got you guys off the hook.

01:41:46.797 --> 01:41:48.874
You weren't really worried,
were you, major?

01:41:49.092 --> 01:41:50.752
No, not much, he wasn't.

01:41:50.969 --> 01:41:53.210
But we still have
one operation to go.

01:41:53.429 --> 01:41:57.973
If you guys foul up on this one, none
of us will ever play the violin again.

01:41:58.185 --> 01:42:00.427
Because up until now,
it's all been a game.

01:42:00.604 --> 01:42:03.226
But as of tomorrow night,
it's gonna be the real thing.

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:05.516
If you want to know how real,
I'll tell you.

01:42:05.734 --> 01:42:08.819
It's my guess the lot of you guys
won't be coming back.

01:42:08.988 --> 01:42:11.111
But there's no sense in squawking
about that.

01:42:11.282 --> 01:42:12.990
Because the Army never did love you.

01:42:13.158 --> 01:42:15.032
Besides, you all volunteered, right?

01:42:15.244 --> 01:42:17.996
- Yeah.
- Well, that's more than I did.

01:42:18.914 --> 01:42:20.492
Sergeant Bowren.

01:42:21.333 --> 01:42:23.907
Look, I know we've been over this
a thousand times...

01:42:24.086 --> 01:42:27.004
but a lot can go wrong.
We gotta be prepared to improvise.

01:42:27.172 --> 01:42:30.173
So let's see what happens
if everything goes right. Ready?

01:42:30.384 --> 01:42:33.171
- One.
- At the roadblock, we've just begun.

01:42:33.387 --> 01:42:36.886
- One.
- At the roadblock, we've just begun.

01:42:37.099 --> 01:42:39.388
- Two.
- The guards are through.

01:42:39.602 --> 01:42:42.721
- Three.
- The major's men are on a spree.

01:42:42.938 --> 01:42:46.058
- Four.
- Major and Wladislaw through the door.

01:42:46.275 --> 01:42:49.774
- Five.
- Pinkley stays out in the drive.

01:42:49.987 --> 01:42:53.356
- Six.
- The major gives the rope a fix.

01:42:53.574 --> 01:42:56.777
- Seven.
- Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven.

01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:01.035
- Eight.
- Jiminez has got a date.

01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:05.205
- Nine.
- The other guys go up the line.

01:43:06.003 --> 01:43:09.586
- Ten.
- Sawyer and Gilpin are in the pen.

01:43:09.798 --> 01:43:13.084
- Eleven.
- Posey guards points five and seven.

01:43:13.761 --> 01:43:17.712
- Twelve.
- Wladislaw and major go down to delve.

01:43:18.267 --> 01:43:19.465
And where's Donald Duck?

01:43:20.436 --> 01:43:23.105
Donald Duck's down at the crossroads
with a machine gun.

01:43:23.522 --> 01:43:26.274
And he'd better not be asleep,
or we'll all be in trouble.

01:43:28.236 --> 01:43:31.901
- Thirteen.
- Franko goes up without being seen.

01:43:32.573 --> 01:43:34.613
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.

01:43:34.909 --> 01:43:37.661
- And?
- Mayonnaise cuts the cable...

01:43:37.828 --> 01:43:39.620
Franko cuts the phone.

01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:41.455
- Fifteen.
- Franko goes in...

01:43:41.624 --> 01:43:43.083
where the others have been.

01:43:43.501 --> 01:43:47.830
- Sixteen.
- We all come out like it's Halloween.

01:43:49.423 --> 01:43:51.250
And kill every officer in sight.

01:43:51.425 --> 01:43:52.836
Ours or theirs?

01:43:53.010 --> 01:43:54.884
Well, let's start off with theirs, huh?

01:43:55.096 --> 01:43:57.634
Let's take it again from the top,
without the ad-libs.

01:43:57.848 --> 01:44:01.467
- All right, one.
- Down the roadblock, we've just begun.

01:44:01.686 --> 01:44:04.603
- Two.
- The guards are through.

01:44:04.772 --> 01:44:08.058
- Three.
- The major's men are on a spree.

01:44:08.442 --> 01:44:10.933
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.

01:44:11.153 --> 01:44:14.024
- And?
- Mayonnaise cuts the cable...

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.948
Franko cuts the phone.

01:44:16.117 --> 01:44:18.074
- Fifteen.
- Franko goes in...

01:44:18.244 --> 01:44:19.821
where the others have been.

01:44:20.288 --> 01:44:24.499
- Sixteen.
- We all come out like it's Halloween.

01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:26.618
Seventeen?

01:44:26.794 --> 01:44:29.629
Seventeen. D-day.

01:44:30.172 --> 01:44:33.009
We get out as best we can
and make our way to the coast.

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.461
And hope that the entire invasion
hasn't been a total disaster.

01:44:37.681 --> 01:44:39.970
Otherwise, we got a long swim home.

01:44:40.559 --> 01:44:42.302
How much longer, major?

01:44:42.477 --> 01:44:43.888
I'll ask the driver.

01:44:50.904 --> 01:44:53.573
You're not worried about jumping
at night, are you?

01:44:56.284 --> 01:44:57.778
Getting back.

01:45:05.376 --> 01:45:06.419
Ready.

01:45:11.341 --> 01:45:12.592
Cargo.

01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:25.063
Go.

01:45:40.536 --> 01:45:43.787
- Where have you been? We're late.
- We've been looking for Jiminez.

01:45:44.123 --> 01:45:47.160
- And?
- We found him hung up in an apple tree.

01:45:47.377 --> 01:45:50.129
- His neck's broken.
- You mean he's dead?

01:45:50.339 --> 01:45:52.581
That's exactly what I mean.

01:45:54.885 --> 01:45:56.130
- This far.
- Yeah.

01:45:59.056 --> 01:46:02.591
All right, Franko, now you know why
we all checked out on that rope, huh?

01:46:06.355 --> 01:46:07.897
Gilpin, number eight.

01:46:08.107 --> 01:46:10.230
Gilpin, did you hear me?

01:46:10.401 --> 01:46:12.974
- Eight.
- Gilpin's got a date?

01:46:16.156 --> 01:46:18.233
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.

01:46:18.451 --> 01:46:20.693
- And?
- Gilpin cuts the cables...

01:46:20.912 --> 01:46:23.284
Franko cuts the phone.
- Let's go.

01:46:32.132 --> 01:46:35.797
- What a great way to start out, huh?
- Yeah.

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.953
So far, so good, major.

01:48:50.315 --> 01:48:52.141
Where are those guys?

01:48:54.652 --> 01:48:56.111
Here they come.

01:48:58.656 --> 01:49:00.150
Let's go.

01:49:17.009 --> 01:49:18.918
Come on, Pinkley, let's go.

01:49:54.256 --> 01:49:57.091
It's just like the major
said it would be.

01:49:57.425 --> 01:50:00.925
Yeah, really some spread, ain't it?

01:50:02.764 --> 01:50:04.223
There they go now.

01:50:24.661 --> 01:50:27.615
- No blackout?
- Think they're expecting us?

01:50:27.789 --> 01:50:29.449
Hey, the silencer!

01:51:43.408 --> 01:51:44.819
Let's go.

01:52:42.386 --> 01:52:44.129
"Radio room."

01:53:03.616 --> 01:53:06.285
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

01:53:09.538 --> 01:53:11.531
I don't know how many
Germans we'll kill...

01:53:11.749 --> 01:53:13.955
but we're gonna make
an awful lot of noise.

01:53:15.586 --> 01:53:17.958
Hey, do you believe
in stuff like that?

01:53:19.256 --> 01:53:21.296
Oh, I don't know, can't hurt nothing.

01:53:22.426 --> 01:53:24.715
I don't think I believe
in stuff like that.

01:54:22.947 --> 01:54:26.398
- So, how's your German holding up?
- Oh, man, I don't know.

01:54:26.576 --> 01:54:28.864
You know those two guys
walking down the stairs?

01:54:29.036 --> 01:54:30.863
I couldn't understand
a word they said.

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:34.164
- Just act mean and grunt, huh?
- Yeah.

01:54:35.835 --> 01:54:37.662
Okay, Room 11.

01:55:06.283 --> 01:55:07.326
So?

01:55:08.493 --> 01:55:11.031
You go first, I'll carry the bags.

01:55:39.025 --> 01:55:40.733
We'll set it up here.

01:56:24.238 --> 01:56:28.283
- They should've been here by now.
- Yeah.

01:57:10.243 --> 01:57:11.494
Guard!

01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:33.216
I left the rope.

01:58:34.621 --> 01:58:36.290
Hold it.

01:58:50.096 --> 01:58:51.347
Idiot.

01:58:54.559 --> 01:58:57.429
- Do it, Polack!
- Shut up.

01:59:01.482 --> 01:59:02.858
Hurry up.

01:59:42.566 --> 01:59:43.609
Now.

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.363
Now.

02:00:01.169 --> 02:00:02.829
Ready for the turkey shoot?

02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:11.358
I wish I could read this.
I think it's dirty.

02:02:55.889 --> 02:02:57.681
Hey! What are you doing?

02:02:57.891 --> 02:03:01.391
Franko and the others
are still down there. Come on!

02:03:41.435 --> 02:03:42.550
Hey, Maggott.

02:03:42.770 --> 02:03:45.177
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of sight.

02:05:14.698 --> 02:05:16.026
Wolfgang?

02:05:17.826 --> 02:05:18.869
Wolfgang?

02:05:22.331 --> 02:05:23.373
Wolfgang?

02:06:56.385 --> 02:06:57.583
Scream.

02:07:01.807 --> 02:07:03.182
Scream.

02:07:04.643 --> 02:07:07.313
Scream, you slut.

02:07:07.563 --> 02:07:09.686
<i>Sprechen,</i> you harlot.

02:07:09.983 --> 02:07:11.311
Scream.

02:07:35.258 --> 02:07:36.539
Radio room.

02:08:53.046 --> 02:08:55.881
Blow it! Blow it!

02:09:42.639 --> 02:09:45.343
- Hey, what's going on?
- Shut up.

02:10:59.968 --> 02:11:02.541
It's Judgment Day, you sinners.

02:11:03.138 --> 02:11:04.549
Come out.

02:11:05.223 --> 02:11:07.180
Come out, wherever you are.

02:11:12.188 --> 02:11:14.065
Come out.

02:11:14.733 --> 02:11:16.061
Come out.

02:12:58.214 --> 02:12:59.257
Now!

02:13:17.067 --> 02:13:19.985
- You didn't think about that, did you?
- They gotta breathe.

02:13:50.809 --> 02:13:52.352
You got the grenades?

02:13:53.479 --> 02:13:54.641
Right. Right, sir.

02:13:55.272 --> 02:13:57.395
We got enough here
to blow up the world.

02:14:15.293 --> 02:14:17.500
What are we gonna do about them?

02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:21.087
We'll feed the French
and kill the Germans.

02:14:23.593 --> 02:14:26.345
- Franko, cover that corner.
- What happened?

02:14:26.513 --> 02:14:30.345
They're locked in the bunker. There's
gotta be some air vents. Take a look.

02:14:30.558 --> 02:14:32.717
All right, bring your grenades!
Over here!

02:14:32.936 --> 02:14:34.478
I'll take them.

02:14:45.241 --> 02:14:46.652
Here they are.

02:14:52.873 --> 02:14:54.416
Take it down there.

02:14:56.335 --> 02:14:57.913
Bowren, get Vladek out here.

02:15:00.923 --> 02:15:02.667
Where's that coming from?

02:15:09.932 --> 02:15:11.391
Come on, Vladek, we need you.

02:15:12.727 --> 02:15:14.387
Come on, come on.

02:15:18.232 --> 02:15:21.850
Franko! Get over here and see
if you can start one of those trucks!

02:15:40.339 --> 02:15:44.206
Wladislaw, Jefferson. Get the lids
off those other ventilators.

02:15:49.348 --> 02:15:51.554
You know what you gotta do, so do it.
Hurry up!

02:16:04.237 --> 02:16:06.230
All right, you Frenchies, beat it.

02:16:27.595 --> 02:16:29.671
No, it's all right. It's all right. Go on.

02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:38.477
Get back up there
and cover that bridge!

02:16:41.067 --> 02:16:42.348
Move it!

02:16:50.286 --> 02:16:51.566
Help Bowren!

02:17:16.312 --> 02:17:17.722
There they are!

02:17:37.626 --> 02:17:39.583
Hurry it up. Posey's got trouble!

02:17:45.424 --> 02:17:47.833
Get one of those trucks started!

02:17:57.603 --> 02:18:01.056
No, no, no. Leave the pins in.
The pins in, huh?

02:18:28.427 --> 02:18:30.669
Bowren, get some gasoline.

02:18:31.555 --> 02:18:33.133
Some gasoline?

02:18:33.599 --> 02:18:34.642
Are you sure?

02:18:35.226 --> 02:18:37.799
You want to ask Pinkley and Vladek?
Now, get going!

02:18:40.272 --> 02:18:41.387
Yes, sir.

02:19:15.602 --> 02:19:17.808
Sawyer, Lever, cover that bridge!

02:19:18.103 --> 02:19:20.808
Do you believe these guys?
They keep these things locked.

02:19:21.023 --> 02:19:22.518
Keep looking!

02:19:30.199 --> 02:19:31.777
The other road! The other road!

02:20:23.795 --> 02:20:26.167
Come on, baby.
Where are you, baby?

02:20:44.192 --> 02:20:45.567
Let's go!

02:20:49.155 --> 02:20:50.318
Move over.

02:20:50.532 --> 02:20:52.192
Move over!

02:20:52.951 --> 02:20:54.410
Wladislaw...

02:20:54.619 --> 02:20:56.742
get Vladek out of there, huh?

02:21:33.742 --> 02:21:35.117
Another flare! Another flare!

02:21:46.087 --> 02:21:47.463
Come on, you...

02:21:48.757 --> 02:21:51.213
Jefferson! When I give you the signal...

02:21:51.385 --> 02:21:54.968
set them off one, two, three, four,
and get the hell out of there.

02:21:55.181 --> 02:21:57.055
We'll wait for you at the bridge.

02:21:57.266 --> 02:21:58.595
- Right?
- Right.

02:22:02.772 --> 02:22:03.886
Let's go!

02:22:13.533 --> 02:22:16.024
Come on, let's go.
Come on, hurry up!

02:22:40.060 --> 02:22:41.388
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

02:22:41.603 --> 02:22:43.810
Jefferson, set them off!

02:22:44.147 --> 02:22:46.983
Get that thing out of here
or we'll all go up!

02:23:12.677 --> 02:23:14.005
Let's go.

02:23:19.183 --> 02:23:20.843
They're not gonna make it.

02:23:21.978 --> 02:23:25.014
We'll get a boat and get out
the other side. Come on, let's go.

02:24:02.728 --> 02:24:04.721
All right, blow it!

02:24:07.191 --> 02:24:10.476
Remember, Jefferson, 20 seconds!

02:24:16.617 --> 02:24:17.660
Run!

02:24:18.369 --> 02:24:20.029
- Faster, faster.
- Come on! Come on!

02:24:20.245 --> 02:24:21.740
Jefferson faster.

02:24:21.914 --> 02:24:24.916
Come on, Jefferson. Run!

02:24:25.126 --> 02:24:26.241
- Go!
- Hurry up!

02:24:26.419 --> 02:24:29.254
- Come on, move!
- Come on, come on.

02:24:30.715 --> 02:24:33.289
- It's gonna blow!
- Come on!

02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:35.170
Come on, Jefferson!

02:24:37.013 --> 02:24:38.342
Jefferson!

02:25:30.776 --> 02:25:32.021
Come on, start.

02:25:33.362 --> 02:25:36.482
It won't start! It won't start!
The bastard won't start!

02:25:50.714 --> 02:25:51.994
All right, get in!

02:26:41.641 --> 02:26:44.214
Shift! Shift it, shift it!

02:27:28.522 --> 02:27:29.933
We made it!

02:27:30.107 --> 02:27:33.310
We made it. Those stupid bastards,
we made it!

02:27:33.527 --> 02:27:34.772
Come on! Keep shooting!

02:27:45.456 --> 02:27:46.707
Major!

02:27:52.087 --> 02:27:55.124
<i>Among the many reports of the raid</i>
<i>on the chateau near Rennes...</i>

02:27:55.299 --> 02:27:58.216
<i>perhaps the most objective</i>
<i>is the one by General Worden...</i>

02:27:58.385 --> 02:27:59.927
<i>in which he states:</i>

02:28:00.095 --> 02:28:03.014
<i>"We are recommending that those</i>
<i>members of the group known...</i>

02:28:03.183 --> 02:28:05.756
<i>as 'The Dirty Dozen ' who survived</i>
<i>this operation...</i>

02:28:05.935 --> 02:28:08.343
<i>should have their records</i>
<i>amended to indicate...</i>

02:28:08.521 --> 02:28:11.890
<i>that they are being returned</i>
<i>to active duty at their former ranks.</i>

02:28:12.275 --> 02:28:16.144
<i>And that the next of kin of those</i>
<i>prisoners who were killed be advised...</i>

02:28:16.322 --> 02:28:19.821
<i>that they lost their lives
in the line of duty. "</i>

02:28:20.159 --> 02:28:21.653
You did a fine job, major.

02:28:24.413 --> 02:28:25.658
I'll see you around.

02:28:26.332 --> 02:28:28.455
You did a good job, soldier.

02:28:28.626 --> 02:28:31.413
Hurry up and get well.
We need men like you out there.

02:28:46.143 --> 02:28:47.851
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

02:28:48.167 --> 02:28:51.154
Killing generals could get to be
a habit with me.
