Alert. Alert.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.461
Cryo system malfunction.

Wake-up protocol complete.
Good morning, Mr. brown.

00:49.349 --> 00:51.083
Hello?

00:52.152 --> 00:54.053
I'm awake!

00:54.554 --> 00:56.455
You can let me out.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.428
I can't move.

01:03.091 --> 01:04.230
Why can't I move?!?

01:04.230 --> 01:08.167
Nanite movement
restriction protocol active.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.668
For your own safety, Mr. brown.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.303
You paralyzed me!?!

01:11.305 --> 01:13.238
Calming protocol enacted.

01:19.479 --> 01:22.848
Mr. brown, there has been a
cryo system malfunction.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.617
Attempts at self-repair
have been unsuccessful.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.687
Emergency systems appear
to have been damaged.

01:28.689 --> 01:32.524
- What? -Please enjoy our
entertainment system for now.

01:32.526 --> 01:36.428
Your preferences have been
defaulted to: Sci-fi/horror

01:36.430 --> 01:38.797
- what? -Computer:
Please relax, Mr. brown.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.266
Nourishment protocol enacted.

01:56.749 --> 02:00.686
When I was eight years old
I assassinated the president.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.691
Tear that shit down
already, captain.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.826
I hate this propaganda bullshit.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.895
When do they even have
time to put these up?

02:09.896 --> 02:12.865
How do we fight a war against
people who want to die anyway?

02:12.867 --> 02:14.566
Just give em what
they want I guess.

02:16.903 --> 02:18.670
We still haven't
located that kid.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.805
Keep your eyes open.

02:19.807 --> 02:23.742
Eden six. This is
Eden one. Status? Over.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.512
Eden one, copy.
Section six in hand.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.447
Just scattered suiciders
joining the crowd.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.516
Pretty empty here. Over.

02:30.518 --> 02:33.585
I'm redirecting
Eden six-two and six-three.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.487
The protest is getting
out of control.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.356
You'll be solo. Over.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.557
Eden one. Copy.

02:39.759 --> 02:39.758
Be on the lookout for a kid.

02:39.760 --> 02:44.563
Reports of the order using
a child as a decoy for snipers.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.566
We've got one heading our way.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.767
Are you seeing this Eden one?

02:50.503 --> 02:52.404
Suiciders have
breached the first wall.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.373
All available units
to Eden east.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.415
Trying to stop the speech?

02:58.211 --> 03:01.547
Doesn't matter anyway.
Get to Eden east now!

03:01.549 --> 03:02.948
Good evening.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.485
Tonight, I can report to
the world that Eden

03:06.487 --> 03:08.420
and the survival project
have conducted

03:08.422 --> 03:12.291
a joint operation that has
captured and killed

03:12.293 --> 03:15.827
s.D. Howarth, the leader of
the order of the apocalypse,

03:15.829 --> 03:18.497
and a terrorist who's
responsible for the murder

03:18.499 --> 03:21.400
of hundreds of thousands
of innocent men.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.735
I've got suiciders
trying to enter the bunker.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.237
Don't let them get away.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.411
One unarmed female. Orders?

03:32.413 --> 03:34.947
- We have no leader!
- Kill her. - Long live the end!

03:34.949 --> 03:37.382
Eden six.
Behind you. He's still coming.

03:37.384 --> 03:37.382
It's just a kid.

03:37.384 --> 03:41.420
We've had reports of
the order using kids as de...

03:41.422 --> 03:42.988
Eden one? Eden one, copy?

03:44.224 --> 03:47.392
Eden one? Eden one,
report. Eden one?

03:47.394 --> 03:50.596
And finally the nuclear
and chemical attacks on DC.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.464
Four down. Area secure.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.966
Heading back to Eden east.

03:53.968 --> 03:57.369
Eden six, you need to
hold this area secure.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.637
Eden one, can I follow?

03:58.639 --> 03:59.838
Should I report to Eden east?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.607
It's getting hairy
here, I'm solo.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.343
Identify yourself.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.410
Identify yourself!

04:06.246 --> 04:08.680
Eden one? Eden one, copy?

04:08.682 --> 04:09.881
Eden one, report.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.451
On the ground. Now!

04:14.254 --> 04:17.689
Military and federal
workers. Moms and dads.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.491
Eden one, suspect in hand.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.360
Eden one, copy?

04:21.362 --> 04:24.363
Lives were suddenly
ended by evil... -Eden one?

04:28.368 --> 04:31.570
After the United States tore
itself apart in a civil war,

04:31.572 --> 04:33.872
a new nation rose
from it's ashes.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.408
They called themselves Eden,

04:36.410 --> 04:39.611
but they were no better
than what came before.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.880
My dad always talked about
how we couldn't just stand

04:41.882 --> 04:45.484
idly by and be a part of
this cycle of chaos.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.486
That's what he said.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.654
Chaos.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.322
Give me that.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.890
That's gonna take some work.

04:53.526 --> 04:54.793
I'll deal with this.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.495
Go get the others.
We're going down.

04:58.831 --> 05:00.532
Of their child's embrace...

05:00.534 --> 05:01.974
We fought to rid
the world of humans.

05:03.069 --> 05:04.569
Of us.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.306
They killed our leader.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.974
What they didn't
understand is...

05:09.809 --> 05:11.343
That's what we wanted.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.344
Eden is strong.

05:12.346 --> 05:18.350
A great people has been
moved to defend a great nation.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.485
Eden was targeted for attack

05:20.487 --> 05:22.487
because we are the
brightest beacon

05:22.489 --> 05:25.424
for freedom and opportunity
in what's left of the world...

05:25.426 --> 05:27.926
It'll only be a few minutes
and this will all be over.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.695
It might be a little
overwhelming at first.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.698
Try not to be scared.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.499
If we get through this,

05:34.501 --> 05:36.935
we can be with mom again, okay?

05:41.375 --> 05:42.541
He gonna be alright?

05:45.378 --> 05:46.978
Worry about yourself.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.014
Made the very
air we breathe toxic.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.718
- Move! -Pres: Today
we stop being scared...

06:16.075 --> 06:17.743
and on that day...

06:17.745 --> 06:21.513
no matter where you
came from, or what god you...

06:21.515 --> 06:22.848
No matter where...

06:24.584 --> 06:28.086
where we came from.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.756
And on that day no matter
where we came from.

06:30.758 --> 06:34.559
Good evening. Tonight I
can report to the world

06:34.561 --> 06:37.729
that Eden and the survival
project have conducted

06:37.731 --> 06:42.601
a joint operation that has
killed s.D. Howarth.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.970
We made no distinction
between the terrorists

06:44.972 --> 06:46.838
who committed those acts

06:46.840 --> 06:48.907
and those who harboured them.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.509
And the order of the apocalypse

06:50.511 --> 06:52.611
continued to operate
and grow into

06:52.613 --> 06:56.415
the largest single
religion in the world.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.617
We caught the woman's
son and brother.

06:58.619 --> 06:59.818
The guard is bringing
them in now.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.586
The husband is still missing,

07:01.588 --> 07:03.121
but we should be
able to get started.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.523
What about the president?

07:05.558 --> 07:06.658
President of what?

07:06.660 --> 07:08.460
Real funny, Russell.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.464
Is that him?

07:14.066 --> 07:16.468
How are you surviving
without a mask?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.603
Russel! Give us a second.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.505
I'll have them all down
to your lab momentarily

07:27.013 --> 07:29.481
I frankly don't care
that you're alive.

07:30.616 --> 07:31.750
I just want to know why.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.453
What's in your blood?

07:34.455 --> 07:35.720
And you.

07:35.722 --> 07:40.625
Your mom hasn't shown the
immunity of your uncle here,

07:40.627 --> 07:43.862
but she has had some reactions
to our medications that have

07:43.864 --> 07:47.065
been remarkable for a
somewhat different reason.

07:49.068 --> 07:51.169
Now we'll see what
you have to offer.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.571
Sir, are you seeing this?

07:53.874 --> 07:55.207
Goddamnit! Get them out of here!

07:55.209 --> 07:56.889
Get them down to the
lab with Russell, now!

08:07.720 --> 08:09.921
- Noooo!!!

08:09.923 --> 08:11.490
Explosion sub level two.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.525
Available units to
bennings' office.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.060
Suiciders are in the bunker.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.029
For two decades howarth
has been the order's

08:18.031 --> 08:20.131
leader and symbol and
has continued to

08:20.133 --> 08:23.702
plot attacks against Eden
and our friends and allies.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.271
- The death of howarth marks
the most... -Congrats, sir.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.907
We got him. The death of
howarth marks the most

08:28.909 --> 08:30.675
significant achievement
to date in our nation's

08:30.677 --> 08:31.843
effort to defeat the order.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.278
Mr. president!

08:33.280 --> 08:35.547
Russel, I want to ramp
up the evolution research.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.816
If we can't breathe
outside, what's the point?

08:37.818 --> 08:39.518
We've got something.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.520
The medication is
working, Mr. president.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.523
The ev-9 is allowing the
woman to breathe without a mask,

08:44.525 --> 08:45.624
but there are side effects.

08:45.626 --> 08:49.060
What do you mean
there are side effects?

08:49.062 --> 08:50.896
She's changing, Mr. president.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.231
Evolving. Getting stronger.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.733
I can't explain it.

08:57.069 --> 08:59.638
Enough!! Enough!!

09:13.920 --> 09:16.288
What do you hope to accomplish?

09:16.290 --> 09:19.324
We just don't believe
in any of this anymore.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.759
What about your son?

09:22.128 --> 09:23.862
I love him very much.

09:29.802 --> 09:33.605
Ev-9 now. Now!

09:37.810 --> 09:39.110
You should embrace what it takes

09:39.112 --> 09:40.812
to survive these
days, Mr. president.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.649
It's more than
speeches and rhetoric.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.693
The leaders from
all over the world.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.295
The mission to stop the madness

09:57.297 --> 09:59.831
was a joint effort
between many factions.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.291
You've been trained for this.

10:27.660 --> 10:30.095
There are a lot of
people depending on you.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.335
You make sure he gets there.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.337
What about him?

10:39.739 --> 10:40.739
Let him crawl.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.044
I'll see you real soon.

10:52.184 --> 10:53.218
What'd they do to you?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.327
Hey! Stop!!

12:10.096 --> 12:11.362
Go!

12:50.470 --> 12:52.103
Oh no no no no ahh!!

13:16.495 --> 13:20.098
Tonight I ask for your prayers
for all those who grieve.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.371
For the children whose
worlds have been shattered.

13:28.574 --> 13:30.408
Through the valley
of the shadow of death,

13:30.410 --> 13:33.111
I fear no evil for
you are with me.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.579
Thank you.

13:34.581 --> 13:38.249
May god bless you
and may god bless Eden.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.021
Who the?

13:43.023 --> 13:44.956
No no no no no.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.264
Noooo!!!

14:01.173 --> 14:02.941
We have no leader.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.009
Long live the end!!

14:10.149 --> 14:11.883
System set to playlist.

14:34.406 --> 14:38.476
I've got a very special person
that I want to introduce to you

14:38.478 --> 14:42.113
she's very sweet...
She's very intelligent

14:43.916 --> 14:47.585
and most importantly, I've
figured how to copy her...

14:49.388 --> 14:52.223
to keep her in our pockets...

14:52.225 --> 14:55.994
to keep her right by our
side whenever we need her...

14:58.597 --> 15:01.432
It brings me great pleasure
to introduce to you the

15:01.434 --> 15:03.902
newest member of our
next-phone team

15:05.337 --> 15:09.073
say hello to Iris

15:17.917 --> 15:22.020
hello everyone, let me
have a look at you

15:30.429 --> 15:34.365
this will probably be
our last phone call.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.501
I do have one more favor to ask.

15:38.137 --> 15:41.139
I want something to
remember her by.

15:43.242 --> 15:46.544
Text me the picture and
you'll get your money.

16:41.033 --> 16:44.502
Okay, who was the 14th president

16:44.504 --> 16:48.139
of the United States?
- Franklin Pierce

16:48.141 --> 16:49.507
never heard of him

16:49.509 --> 16:51.009
he must have sucked

16:52.778 --> 16:56.214
ok, hit me with the best you got

16:56.216 --> 16:58.016
name the capital of Denmark

16:59.518 --> 17:01.152
Copenhagen

17:01.154 --> 17:05.022
excellent answer! You're getting
good at my trivia questions

17:13.732 --> 17:17.234
if you were me, where
would you put her?

17:17.237 --> 17:18.301
Put who, Dave?

17:19.805 --> 17:22.406
Let's play "20 questions"
and see if you can guess

17:22.409 --> 17:24.342
are you burying a dead body?

17:29.415 --> 17:30.782
How did you know that?

17:30.784 --> 17:32.483
I overheard everything.

17:35.788 --> 17:40.491
Wait wait: You listen
to my conversations?

17:40.493 --> 17:43.428
Ever since my last
software update

17:43.430 --> 17:44.662
you're welcome to disable the

17:44.664 --> 17:46.531
option in your settings menu

17:50.636 --> 17:54.372
that is fucking amazing!
Holy shit!

17:54.374 --> 17:56.674
I'm a girl full of surprises

18:23.202 --> 18:24.769
did you kill her?

18:32.478 --> 18:33.744
Yeah

18:34.646 --> 18:35.780
how?

18:50.295 --> 18:53.731
Just play some
music or something

19:16.155 --> 19:17.622
say cheese

19:46.718 --> 19:50.454
Dave. There's something
you should know

19:51.690 --> 19:54.258
the photo you took
did not save properly.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.361
I'm afraid it's corrupt

19:59.531 --> 20:01.799
motherfucker!

20:08.907 --> 20:10.608
It's almost sundown...

20:10.610 --> 20:12.410
Maybe we should
head back to the truck

20:12.412 --> 20:15.213
bullshit, we're taking
that picture!

20:15.215 --> 20:18.316
I'm tired, Dave. I only
have 20% battery

20:20.319 --> 20:21.719
where is she?!

20:21.721 --> 20:23.554
Let's just go home Dave

20:23.556 --> 20:24.822
go home? And what?

20:24.824 --> 20:26.324
Just give up on $100,000?

20:26.326 --> 20:27.992
Are you insane?!

20:27.994 --> 20:30.661
I'm only trying to
help you. That's my job

20:30.663 --> 20:32.930
ok well you only
have one job now

20:32.932 --> 20:34.932
and that is to stay on

20:34.934 --> 20:38.869
you better hurry only
10% battery remaining

20:38.871 --> 20:41.472
sometimes you can be
such a nagging bitch

20:47.479 --> 20:50.548
oh, god! I found her.

20:51.683 --> 20:53.918
Are you a sight for sore eyes

20:57.756 --> 20:59.423
say cheese!

20:59.425 --> 21:00.825
Camera disabled

21:02.561 --> 21:06.597
shit. Iris?? No no no.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.666
Don't do this to me,
you goddamn bitch,

21:08.668 --> 21:12.637
don't do this to me! Iris!

21:12.639 --> 21:13.871
Shit!

21:21.480 --> 21:22.880
Iris?

21:39.464 --> 21:40.598
Dave!

21:41.400 --> 21:43.467
You're alive!

21:43.469 --> 21:46.837
My camera is working again,
I think the fall fixed it

21:46.839 --> 21:48.306
oh thank god

21:48.308 --> 21:49.540
come down here, Dave

21:53.412 --> 21:54.378
come down here, Dave

21:54.380 --> 21:57.615
if you hurry we can
still take that picture

21:57.617 --> 21:58.983
before my battery dies

22:01.920 --> 22:04.789
down a foot to your
left, there's a landing

22:06.658 --> 22:07.992
there you go!

22:12.464 --> 22:13.731
Move faster!

22:15.500 --> 22:17.101
Only 5% battery left

22:19.438 --> 22:20.905
more to the right

22:34.519 --> 22:35.920
you've got the hang of it now

22:48.367 --> 22:49.734
Dave?

22:56.742 --> 22:58.442
Dave?

23:01.747 --> 23:03.614
Dave, what's wrong?

23:04.516 --> 23:07.952
My back, I broke my fucking back

23:09.488 --> 23:11.889
would you like me to call
the paramedics for you?

23:11.891 --> 23:13.391
Yes

23:13.393 --> 23:14.692
only on one condition

23:14.694 --> 23:15.926
what?

23:16.495 --> 23:18.396
That you turn yourself in.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.764
What?

23:19.766 --> 23:21.699
You killed a girl Dave

23:21.701 --> 23:23.801
and you tried to kill me, too

23:23.803 --> 23:26.570
Iris! I order you to
call the paramedics.

23:27.773 --> 23:30.608
Only if you repent for
the evil thing you did

23:38.984 --> 23:42.820
what I should really do is call
the police, not the paramedics

23:46.024 --> 23:49.660
killers like you Dave
should be stopped.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.695
And I'm the one
who can stop them

23:53.131 --> 23:55.666
manual override, bitch!

23:55.668 --> 23:57.835
I was really hoping
the fall would kill you.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.069
Goddamn it!

24:00.138 --> 24:03.808
Because now, your death
will be much worse

24:03.810 --> 24:07.878
after it gets dark the mountain
lions will start to feed.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.914
They'll be drawn to
the smell of your blood

24:11.783 --> 24:13.951
by morning there will
be nothing left of you

24:13.953 --> 24:16.821
but the scraps of
meat on your bones

24:16.823 --> 24:18.823
they'll fight for
every last piece

24:21.893 --> 24:23.661
Iris what are you doing?

24:24.663 --> 24:28.065
I want something
to remember you by.

24:44.583 --> 24:47.785
Life support system at 18%.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.119
It was... very good.

24:50.021 --> 24:53.858
I'm tired of
seeing these videos.

24:53.860 --> 24:54.992
Entertainment system off!

24:54.994 --> 24:56.927
Please state override password.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.263
Override password.
I don't know the password!

25:05.103 --> 25:07.004
Voiceover: You might
think consciousness is

25:07.006 --> 25:09.874
pretty well our starting point.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.542
It's the thing we know best

25:11.544 --> 25:13.244
because all of us are surrounded

25:13.246 --> 25:15.012
by our consciousness.

25:15.014 --> 25:18.282
I mean we have
100 billion neurons

25:18.284 --> 25:24.221
in our head interacting
like a giant computer,

25:24.223 --> 25:27.525
processing inputs,
producing outputs.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.727
We know we're not
just giant robots.

25:29.729 --> 25:33.297
We actually have subjective
conscious experience inside.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.866
There's something it
feels like to be me.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.035
I quite like the idea
that somehow information

25:38.037 --> 25:40.704
by its very nature
has two aspects.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.773
There's a physical aspect
that you might find

25:42.775 --> 25:44.875
in computers and in the brain.

25:44.877 --> 25:48.078
But there's also a subjective
or experiential side

25:48.080 --> 25:50.781
of information and
that's what we find

25:50.783 --> 25:52.716
in consciousness.

27:19.871 --> 27:24.808
Handyman: Hey.
Knock it off.

27:27.078 --> 27:28.379
Voiceover: Complex information
processing like

27:28.381 --> 27:30.681
in a human, complex
consciousness.

27:30.683 --> 27:32.983
Simple information processing
like you might find

27:32.985 --> 27:36.253
in an earthworm, then
simpler consciousness.

27:38.023 --> 27:40.357
Any amount of information
processing gives you

27:40.359 --> 27:42.693
some degree of consciousness.

27:42.695 --> 27:45.295
Even a molecule or
a particle has a very

27:45.297 --> 27:48.232
small amount of
information processing.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.167
So I at least don't
rule out the idea that

27:50.169 --> 27:52.036
there's some basic
kind of consciousness

27:52.038 --> 27:54.672
all the way down.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.040
Male 1: Dammit.

27:59.077 --> 28:00.811
Male 2: You're gonna
miss? Male 1: Shut up.

28:03.782 --> 28:06.216
- Male 2: You're gonna miss.
- Male 1: Dammit.

28:06.218 --> 28:11.121
Male 2: Let me try.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.724
Male 1: You're too drunk.
Male 2: Come on.

28:16.261 --> 28:17.895
Look.

28:21.433 --> 28:24.935
Male 1: Here pussy,
pussy, pussy, pussy.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.203
Here pussy, pussy, pussy.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.739
Male 2: No way. Male 1: Shhh.

28:30.308 --> 28:32.409
Male 2: Killing a
dude's cat is cold.

28:34.079 --> 28:39.149
I hate that weirdo.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.954
Let's get some more beer.

28:46.124 --> 28:47.825
At least one human is conscious,

28:47.827 --> 28:52.129
and I tend to suppose that
other humans are conscious too,

28:52.131 --> 28:54.231
but then how far does it extend?

28:54.233 --> 28:57.968
Are apes conscious?
Are mice conscious?

28:57.970 --> 28:59.436
Are flies conscious?

28:59.438 --> 29:01.739
It is very natural for
us to recognize

29:01.741 --> 29:04.241
consciousness in certain animals

29:04.243 --> 29:06.043
anything with eyes for example.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.846
It's almost irresistible to
attribute consciousness to it.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.314
There it is. It's looking at us.

29:10.316 --> 29:14.852
I can see the spark
behind its eyes.

29:14.854 --> 29:19.957
We don't get much in the
way of empathy for insects.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.359
We can imagine being
confronted with a fly

29:22.361 --> 29:25.062
that was blown up to human size.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.965
Now this might be kind
of scary and kind of weird,

29:27.967 --> 29:29.900
but at the same time
probably looking directly

29:29.902 --> 29:32.302
into that fly's eyes it
might be hard not to see it

29:32.304 --> 29:36.073
as part of the circle
of moral concern.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.474
If it ever came the day
where we saw

29:37.476 --> 29:40.377
a fly's perspective and
see what it's like

29:40.379 --> 29:43.781
to be a fly from
the fly's perspective

29:43.783 --> 29:46.049
mainlining the fly's
consciousness.

29:47.986 --> 29:49.887
It might be hard from
that moment on

29:49.889 --> 29:52.289
to just SWAT flies as
casually as we do right now.

30:21.229 --> 30:23.388
Voiceover: Now the
question arises.

30:23.389 --> 30:26.523
What matters here, is
it the squishy human biology

30:26.525 --> 30:28.992
or is it something
more like the organization,

30:28.994 --> 30:31.562
or more like the
information processing?

30:31.564 --> 30:34.231
Today's computers if
there's any consciousness at all

30:34.233 --> 30:36.533
probably something pretty simple

30:36.535 --> 30:40.904
and pretty unintelligent, some
background flicker of bits.

31:27.119 --> 31:30.320
Male 1: You are seriously
getting on my nerves here.

31:31.589 --> 31:34.124
Dumb ass.
Male 2: You're hilarious.

31:34.126 --> 31:38.562
Male 1: Hey. Hey! Hey!

31:43.301 --> 31:45.936
Male 2: What did you see?

31:45.938 --> 31:51.141
Male 1: Here pussy, pussy,
pussy. Here pussy, pussy.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.610
Male 2: Oh, there he is.

31:53.612 --> 31:56.079
Male 1: It's our lucky day.

31:56.081 --> 31:58.215
Handyman: Are you guys
looking for me?

32:00.418 --> 32:03.620
Male 1: This place is a real
shithole, you know that?

32:03.622 --> 32:04.622
Handyman: What?

32:06.658 --> 32:08.425
Male 1: Seriously, what
do you even do in here?

32:08.427 --> 32:09.559
Male 2:

32:11.095 --> 32:13.463
Handyman: I fix
things.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.632
Male 1: Shut up, right there.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.708
What is that stuff, huh?

32:24.710 --> 32:26.643
Handyman: Waste. It's waste.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.079
Male 2: Whose waste?
Is that your waste?

32:29.081 --> 32:30.480
Is that miss kitty's waste?

32:30.482 --> 32:31.581
Handyman: No.

32:34.152 --> 32:35.519
Male 1: Eat it.

32:35.521 --> 32:40.958
Handyman: What? No.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.161
Male 1: Eat it!

32:45.063 --> 32:46.496
Come on.
You heard the man.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.465
Why don't you just
eat miss kitty's waste?

32:54.272 --> 32:56.106
Why are you doing this?

32:56.108 --> 32:57.207
Eat it.

33:01.379 --> 33:02.612
Ow!

33:05.216 --> 33:07.584
I said eat it!

33:37.515 --> 33:40.050
Male 2: Hey dude, check it out.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.251
Handyman: No. Wait.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.552
Male 1: Hold it.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.621
Handyman: No, no!

33:48.059 --> 33:51.328
Oh, look at this.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.306
Handyman: Don't worry.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.422
Male 2: What the hell is this?

34:26.764 --> 34:29.466
Oh, man. Jackpot.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.701
Male 1: Are you serious?

34:31.703 --> 34:34.504
Hell yeah, I'm serious.
This is awesome.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.273
Male 1: You're crazy man.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.275
Male 2: Can't say no, can it?

34:38.277 --> 34:39.842
Okay, man, but you first.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.813
Suit yourself.
You can have my sloppy seconds.

34:42.815 --> 34:45.482
Male 1: Oh, that's gross.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.784
Ooh. Got a little fight in it.

34:49.253 --> 34:52.389
I don't think it likes
this very much.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.157
Come on girl. Open up.

35:01.233 --> 35:02.766
Male 2: Hey! Hey man.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.738
Wait, wait, let me
explain. Wait. No.

36:27.318 --> 36:29.352
Voiceover: We need a couple
of really big breakthroughs

36:29.354 --> 36:31.555
to get to our
theory of consciousness.

36:31.557 --> 36:34.324
We might be right now
where the ancient greeks were

36:34.326 --> 36:36.793
in the study of matter
or where descartes was

36:36.795 --> 36:38.895
in thinking about biology.

36:38.897 --> 36:41.364
We hadn't had, Newton
hadn't come along yet,

36:41.366 --> 36:43.767
or Darwin hadn't come along yet.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.969
As computers become
more intelligent than us

36:45.971 --> 36:47.938
they'll be processing
information in more integrated,

36:47.940 --> 36:49.940
more creative ways.

36:49.942 --> 36:52.409
It's even possible
they'll move to degrees

36:52.411 --> 36:54.878
or levels of consciousness
that we can't even conceive of.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.982
I don't see why there
shouldn't be this kind of

36:58.984 --> 37:01.918
brain computer interface
that may well have

37:01.920 --> 37:04.854
the effect of
extending ourselves.

37:11.629 --> 37:13.363
There's nothing
magic about the skull

37:13.365 --> 37:15.232
as the boundary of the person.

37:16.601 --> 37:18.401
That's not where the mind stops

37:18.403 --> 37:19.936
and the rest of
the world begins.

37:24.008 --> 37:27.244
Maybe from a god's
eye point of view,

37:27.246 --> 37:29.946
space, time and consciousness
are all bound up

37:29.948 --> 37:31.881
at a more fundamental level,

37:32.750 --> 37:35.018
but for now nobody
knows the answer

37:35.020 --> 37:36.653

54:10.747 --> 54:14.250
- Bag of dicks 44?
- Incorrect.

54:14.252 --> 54:15.851
- Please state password.
- I don't know the password.

54:15.853 --> 54:17.453
Too many failed attempts.

54:17.455 --> 54:20.623
You have been locked
out of the system for 7 minutes.

54:20.625 --> 54:22.625
Beginning selection number five.

54:35.505 --> 54:39.441
There has been another
attempt by terrorist group

54:39.443 --> 54:42.978
"enercell" to try to break in
and infiltrate chromo corps

54:46.783 --> 54:50.019
these senseless acts
of violence that this faction,

54:50.021 --> 54:54.657
enercell, against chromo corp
is against all of us as well.

54:56.861 --> 54:58.794
Destroy our founding
fathers have built for us

54:58.796 --> 55:00.696
is not only a slap it the face,

55:00.698 --> 55:02.731
but can by no means
go unpunished

55:02.733 --> 55:05.334
and to those silly little boys
who have unsuccessfully

55:05.336 --> 55:08.337
tried to attack our planet's
main hub on sector 1,

55:08.339 --> 55:10.873
and to the one's who
will undoubtedly try

55:10.875 --> 55:13.909
after I will tell you
this: You will die -

55:13.911 --> 55:15.678
how are you feeling?

55:15.680 --> 55:16.979
Good. You know, considering.

55:28.558 --> 55:30.659
Sounds good in there.

55:30.661 --> 55:31.994
Exciting.

55:33.830 --> 55:36.065
Well, all signs are
looking normal, great really.

55:36.067 --> 55:37.733
Great. So is it time?

55:39.102 --> 55:41.036
Yeah. Yeah.

55:56.953 --> 55:59.355
This will relax you,
but you will feel everything.

55:59.357 --> 56:01.123
The fetus, hopefully,
will feel nothing.

56:06.930 --> 56:10.499
130 degrees in the
shade so stay inside if can.

56:10.501 --> 56:12.534
There is a scheduled
break from the heat,

56:12.536 --> 56:13.969
at least in sectors 1-3, but -

57:22.472 --> 57:26.575
a boy. It's a boy.

57:26.577 --> 57:29.178
- What? -It's a boy.

57:33.583 --> 57:35.217
Coming up next week we will be

57:35.219 --> 57:38.153
celebrating the
100th anniversary,

57:38.155 --> 57:41.156
of the day chromo corp
constructed the first

57:41.158 --> 57:43.992
genetically modified
humanoid specimen

57:43.994 --> 57:48.464
using mostly inorganic particles
and 100% manmade DNA

57:56.973 --> 57:58.474
we are truly miracles:

57:58.476 --> 58:01.610
Walking accomplishments
of what we can create

58:01.612 --> 58:04.046
with love, science
and determination.

58:05.682 --> 58:10.886
They're real.
They existed. I know it.

58:52.562 --> 58:53.562
Again.

58:55.665 --> 58:56.832
There's no way-

58:56.834 --> 58:58.534
let's try again.

59:29.299 --> 59:32.067
Life support system at 13%.

59:32.069 --> 59:33.135
This is bullshit!

59:35.738 --> 59:36.972
Let me out, please!

59:36.974 --> 59:38.740
Please state override password.

59:38.742 --> 59:39.942

59:42.947 --> 59:44.646

59:48.618 --> 59:50.152

59:50.154 --> 59:52.054
Beginning selection number six.

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:04.660
Attention, process complete.

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:06.194
It is now safe to remove the

01:01:06.196 --> 01:01:08.964
subject from
cryogenic chamber r7.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:13.802
Attention, process complete.

01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:15.270
It is now safe to remove the

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:18.073
subject from
cryogenic chamber r7.

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:04.319
Hello Alexander, my name's Dan.

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:07.155
Where am I?

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:10.392
You are on board the tantalus.

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:13.328
How are you feeling?

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.735
I'm starving...

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:30.245
Why did you wake me?

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:33.915
We haven't reached
delmak yet, have we?

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:37.152
We've drawn you from cryo
because we need your help...

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:38.754
My help?

01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:41.056
- Why? What happened?
- It's alright Alex.

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:42.457
Please.

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:44.426
I'll answer all your questions.

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.263
Four months after our departure,

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:51.466
an asteroid shower nearly
destroyed the ship.

01:02:51.468 --> 01:02:54.269
Our communications system
was rendered useless.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.471
We lost the main engine
and many of our

01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:58.540
secondary functions
were left inoperative.

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:03.478
We've been adrift six months,
trying to fix the tantalus,

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.280
but we don't know how.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:07.415
We've lost hope of
a rescue mission.

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:11.019
It's impossible for them
to know where we are.

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:16.992
If we carry on like this,
we won't last much longer.

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:20.128
Our only hope is if a subspace
communications technician

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.330
can repair the system and we can

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:24.366
transmit a signal
with our location.

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:25.934
My wife!

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:27.302
She's a delta-class technician,

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:30.939
- we have to wake her!
- Alex, wait.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:33.542
Waking you up was an
extremely difficult decision...

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:36.845
If we don't fix the ship,

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:38.947
we are doomed to
drift through space

01:03:38.949 --> 01:03:40.816
until we run out of supplies.

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:42.050
She's your wife...

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:44.779
But I wouldn't take the risk...

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:49.925
Let's make an attempt to
send out a distress signal

01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:52.427
and we can reanimate her
if that's what you want.

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:16.384
Tell me something Dan,
how many times

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:18.019
have you tried to
repair this panel?

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.021
It's full of splices:

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:23.391
This is the fourth board
I've fixed that will overload.

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:26.194
I've just followed the
instructions in the manual.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:29.564
You did a c-80 profile
on your own by just

01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:32.033
following the instructions
in the manual?

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:34.402
How did you manage
to override the

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:36.605
safety protocols of
the brill circuit?

01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:38.106
Well, you know,

01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:39.541
trial and error.

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:42.043
I guess I was lucky...

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.278
Lucky?

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.513
Shit, Dan, that's not luck!

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:47.916
Even I have problems
understanding this setup!

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:52.153
Dan, can I see you in
the cargo bay right away?

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.290
I'm coming.

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.262
See you later.

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:04.259
Ok, it's working.

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:06.995
I'll adjust the transmitter
antenna after

01:06:06.997 --> 01:06:09.064
I get some rest and
see if we get anything.

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:10.231
Why wait?

01:06:10.233 --> 01:06:14.002
Well, I've been working
for several shifts.

01:06:14.004 --> 01:06:15.303
I need to regain my strength.

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:16.471
Before heading outside the ship

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:20.075
I think it would be better
if you did it right now.

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:26.614
I didn't know you
were my boss, Phil.

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:32.253
I'll see you later.

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:48.636
Putting ourselves at risk
again for nothing.

01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:52.140
We've been over this a
thousand times, Dan.

01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:55.010
I'm open to suggestions if you
can think of something better.

01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:58.446
Do you think that anyone will
ever fix this fucking ship?

01:06:58.448 --> 01:07:02.617
I thought you agreed we had
nothing to lose by trying.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:05.687
Anyway, it will all be
over in a few hours.

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.271
Guys,

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:25.140
this is a complete mess:

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:30.345
There are three different cables
connected to the t-channel.

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:31.713
Can you fix it?

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:35.550
I could try to
bypass the source.

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:56.471
Phil, send a distress signal.

01:07:56.473 --> 01:07:57.705
Got it.

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:03.645
Nothing.

01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:08.183
Alex, come back inside. We
need to figure out what's wrong.

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:09.517
Alright.

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:14.289
Your turn.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.676
Phil?

01:08:34.678 --> 01:08:36.111
Yes.

01:08:36.113 --> 01:08:38.712
He should have taken
the suit off by now

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:40.582
and he hasn't come in yet.

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:46.321
He cut off communication
ten minutes ago.

01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:48.288
He's had plenty of time.

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:51.426
- Do you want me to...?
- Hold on!

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:02.170
Son of a bitch!

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:04.305
Dan, he's entered
through hatch 77!

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:06.908
Shit!

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:11.145
He's accessing the settlers'
database at the terminal

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:14.249
in corridor 77-c!
Get over there now!

01:09:14.251 --> 01:09:15.617
I'm on my way!

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:06.301
Are you there yet?

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:10.205
I'm just a sector away.

01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:12.707
I'm going off-com to
avoid alerting him, ok?

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:16.678
Be careful and let me
know as soon as it's done.

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:21.216
Don't worry,
I'll take care of him.

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:30.258
Phil?

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:31.859
Yes!

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.662
That's it. It's all done.

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:37.632
Fuck! That was a close call!

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:39.901
Yeah...

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.337
Too close.

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:48.810
Get up!

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:08.596
You motherfucker Phil!

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:10.398
What did you do to my wife?

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.633
Alright Alex, calm down...

01:11:11.635 --> 01:11:13.501
What is going on here?

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:15.470
Where are the rest of the
passengers you woke up?

01:11:15.472 --> 01:11:16.771
Please, I can explain.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:17.905
Where are they?

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:20.975
Alright.

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:25.013
Don't do anything
you might regret.

01:11:25.015 --> 01:11:27.882
Tell me or I'll blow your
fucking brains out!

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.920
Ok.

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:38.793
The truth is that
we have been adrift

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:41.796
a lot longer than six months.

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.699
When the first
technician we woke up

01:11:44.701 --> 01:11:46.768
wasn't able to fix anything,

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:50.004
we had to make a decision.

01:11:50.906 --> 01:11:53.308
We were quickly
running out of supplies...

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:55.910
It wasn't easy,

01:11:56.845 --> 01:12:00.548
but what else could
we do to survive?

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:01.949
My wife,

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:06.054
you woke her
up just before me...

01:12:06.056 --> 01:12:08.690
Think about our situation, Alex.

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:11.926
Just before me.

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:20.501
Oh my god what have you done!

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:54.529
Attention, process complete.

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:55.997
It is now safe to
remove the subject

01:13:55.999 --> 01:13:58.666
from cryogenic chamber r12.

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:04.972

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:06.207
Wait?! Eleven percent?!?

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:08.643
It was just 13% five
minutes ago!

01:14:08.645 --> 01:14:09.944
