00:00.424 --> 00:05.404
(people chattering)
(light upbeat music)

00:05.504 --> 00:08.644
(water splashing)

00:08.744 --> 00:10.564
Joey, come on!

00:10.664 --> 00:12.764
(water splashing)

00:12.864 --> 00:15.004
Yes!

00:15.104 --> 00:16.204
(Joey laughs)

00:16.304 --> 00:18.304
Yeah! Joey!

00:35.104 --> 00:36.084
How you feeling?

00:36.184 --> 00:41.184
I'm good.

00:45.825 --> 00:47.825
Come on, let's go inside.

00:51.705 --> 00:55.305
(gentle reflective music)

00:58.505 --> 01:01.165
Hello, Mum and Dad!

01:01.265 --> 01:03.265
Look, the wanderer returns!

01:06.664 --> 01:08.845
No, I know you've already
mourned his absence,

01:08.945 --> 01:10.164
particularly you, Mum.

01:10.265 --> 01:12.804
He has risen, like Lazarus,

01:12.904 --> 01:15.645
to become a human rights lawyer.

01:15.744 --> 01:18.485
(laughs) This is killing
you, Mum, isn't it?

01:18.585 --> 01:20.045
I can hear you now,

01:20.145 --> 01:20.904
"I knew you should have stayed

01:20.904 --> 01:22.404
"with that boy, you crazy child!"

01:22.505 --> 01:23.565
Go on, give her a smile.

01:23.664 --> 01:24.964
I feel like a puppet, Pam.

01:25.065 --> 01:26.445
(laughs) Are you still ticklish?

01:26.545 --> 01:28.244
- No.
- Not even here.

01:28.345 --> 01:29.804
(both laughing)

01:29.904 --> 01:30.926
Look at that!

01:31.026 --> 01:32.246
Look at that!

01:32.345 --> 01:37.345
Look at that! (laughing)

01:53.065 --> 01:56.466
(upbeat pop-rock music)

01:59.866 --> 02:02.866
(singer vocalising)

02:23.467 --> 02:26.627
(bus engine whirring)

02:34.147 --> 02:38.967
(door knocking)
(children chattering)

02:39.067 --> 02:41.067
Daddy's here!

02:42.427 --> 02:44.047
(door clunking)

02:44.147 --> 02:46.167
- Hey.
- Ben.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.427
(children chattering)

02:50.907 --> 02:52.807
How have they been?

02:52.907 --> 02:54.047
Good.

02:54.147 --> 02:55.447
How was the journey?

02:55.547 --> 02:57.547
Long.

02:57.907 --> 02:59.007
(footsteps pattering)

02:59.107 --> 03:00.087
Hi, Daddy!

03:00.187 --> 03:00.928
Hi, Daddy!

03:01.028 --> 03:03.768
Wow, Pops, your hair looks nice.

03:03.868 --> 03:05.808
Nanna did it.

03:05.908 --> 03:07.408
Yeah. It was just a bit, um...

03:07.508 --> 03:11.488
(laughs) Are you still using
that wide toothcomb I got you?

03:11.588 --> 03:14.728
Uh, I- I think we lost it.

03:14.828 --> 03:18.408
Okay, I'll get you
another one. (chuckles)

03:18.508 --> 03:21.888
And, um, you need to use
that detangling conditioner,

03:21.988 --> 03:23.968
as well, after every wash.

03:24.068 --> 03:26.068
Right.

03:26.548 --> 03:28.448
I can help, Ben.

03:28.548 --> 03:29.648
It's not just you and your Mum.

03:29.748 --> 03:30.568
There are things that we can-

03:30.668 --> 03:31.888
Actually, there is something.

03:31.988 --> 03:33.988
Oh, okay.

03:36.588 --> 03:37.808
I had a look through the box

03:37.908 --> 03:40.328
of Jess's things that you gave us.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.428
Not all of it, just the photos.

03:42.868 --> 03:44.168
And there's a few people
that I didn't recognise.

03:44.268 --> 03:46.289
Oh, describe them.

03:46.389 --> 03:48.369
There was a couple of girls,

03:48.469 --> 03:51.669
and there was a guy in
quite a few of them.

03:52.829 --> 03:55.289
Said on the back his name's Josh.

03:55.389 --> 03:57.409
Oh, yeah. He was a...

03:57.509 --> 03:58.809
He was an old friend.

03:58.909 --> 04:00.909
Friend or boyfriend?

04:02.109 --> 04:04.089
(laughs) Yeah, boyfriend.

04:04.189 --> 04:06.429
She hadn't seen him for a
really, really long time.

04:09.109 --> 04:10.929
Look in that cupboard.

04:11.029 --> 04:12.329
(cupboard door slams)

04:12.429 --> 04:14.049
No, I don't want three.

04:14.149 --> 04:16.448
I should get them two something to eat

04:16.549 --> 04:17.888
before they yank the
snack cupboard door off.

04:17.989 --> 04:19.209
(Ben laughs)

04:19.308 --> 04:22.909
(gentle thoughtful music)

04:34.590 --> 04:36.590
Oh! Emma!

04:37.909 --> 04:41.109
This is perfect for your wedding!

04:41.989 --> 04:43.849
(laughs) I was just telling your father,

04:43.950 --> 04:45.289
you get your good taste from me.

04:45.390 --> 04:46.489
Okay.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.729
And the wine selection is gorgeous!

04:48.830 --> 04:50.830
Have you already had some?

04:51.310 --> 04:52.250
Little bit.

04:52.349 --> 04:54.090
Your mother's very excited.

04:54.190 --> 04:54.930
I can tell.

04:55.030 --> 04:56.330
And Harry told me you've finally

04:56.430 --> 04:58.130
put your little flat on the market.

04:58.229 --> 04:59.289
Yeah.

04:59.390 --> 05:01.390
Good!

05:02.750 --> 05:05.010
This is a new chapter.

05:05.109 --> 05:08.630
(light thoughtful music)

05:11.310 --> 05:13.909
Thank you.

05:16.510 --> 05:20.270
After Joey died, I know
what we all went through.

05:21.270 --> 05:24.971
And I could never imagine

05:25.070 --> 05:29.450
a time when I would feel
so energised and excited.

05:29.551 --> 05:31.291
Are we still talking about the wine?

05:31.390 --> 05:33.770
(laughs) I'm talking about the wedding.

05:33.871 --> 05:35.911
I'm talking about being happy.

05:37.191 --> 05:39.191
And I want to thank you for that.

05:41.510 --> 05:43.731
You are, aren't you?

05:43.830 --> 05:44.931
Happy?

05:45.031 --> 05:46.691
Yes, Mum, of course!

05:46.791 --> 05:47.651
(Hannah laughs)

05:47.751 --> 05:50.171
Look, I am telling
ya, she never mentioned him.

05:50.270 --> 05:52.270
Hang on.

05:53.991 --> 05:55.991
Explain this to me again.

05:56.991 --> 06:01.352
There were only two messages
on Jess's phone from Josh.

06:02.431 --> 06:05.092
They said, "You were amazing last night"

06:05.192 --> 06:07.192
and "Don't tell Ben."

06:08.392 --> 06:09.731
I mean, there must be other
messages between them,

06:09.832 --> 06:10.551
but I just don't know how to-

06:10.551 --> 06:11.412
How to what?

06:11.512 --> 06:13.512
What are you gonna do?

06:13.832 --> 06:16.092
Read all her emails?

06:16.191 --> 06:18.252
Go through her social media? What?

06:18.352 --> 06:19.051
Well, let's say I do.

06:19.152 --> 06:20.371
Let's say you don't!

06:20.472 --> 06:24.491
I hate saying this, Ben, but Jess is dead.

06:24.592 --> 06:25.311
Do you think I don't know that?

06:25.311 --> 06:26.691
I think you're not acting like it.

06:26.792 --> 06:29.811
Whatever you find on that phone

06:29.912 --> 06:31.912
you can't talk to her about it.

06:32.512 --> 06:35.772
You read those messages,
and you'll always regret it.

06:35.871 --> 06:38.491
Either you find out she did cheat on you,

06:38.592 --> 06:39.852
and you'll hate her,

06:39.952 --> 06:41.012
or you'll find out she didn't,

06:41.111 --> 06:42.731
you didn't trust her,
and you'll hate yourself.

06:42.832 --> 06:43.592
Either way, Ben, what does it matter?

06:43.592 --> 06:45.673
It matters to me!

06:48.553 --> 06:50.553
Is this about Emma?

06:52.233 --> 06:54.092
Jess and Emma have nothing
to do with each other.

06:54.193 --> 06:57.212
The only reason you are
not with Emma, is Jess.

06:57.313 --> 06:58.533
- That's not true!
- It is.

06:58.632 --> 07:00.413
Dee, you need to listen to me!

07:00.512 --> 07:02.772
No, you need to listen to me!

07:02.873 --> 07:05.253
(tense music)

07:05.353 --> 07:09.653
I tell you to move on, and
you don't listen to me.

07:09.753 --> 07:12.772
I tell you to write about it,
and you don't listen to me.

07:12.873 --> 07:15.493
I tell you to go after Emma,
and you don't listen to me.

07:15.593 --> 07:18.293
I am tired of not being listened to, Ben.

07:18.392 --> 07:20.832
So, please, listen to me now.

07:22.832 --> 07:24.832
Don't do this.

07:33.433 --> 07:35.754
(Dee sighs)

07:37.993 --> 07:40.014
(birds chirping)

07:40.113 --> 07:42.654
You really don't have to, Dad.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.854
I don't mind.

07:44.954 --> 07:46.214
Wanna get the best price for the place.

07:46.313 --> 07:48.514
I mean, your mother's spending
the money already, so.

07:49.834 --> 07:51.293
Dad?

07:51.394 --> 07:52.654
How did you know that Mum was the one?

07:52.754 --> 07:54.754
She told me.

07:58.274 --> 08:00.873
(Jeremy sighs)

08:01.714 --> 08:03.173
She made me happy.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.274
She still makes me happy.

08:05.754 --> 08:07.254
Look, your mother is-

08:07.354 --> 08:08.053
Mad?

08:08.154 --> 08:09.733
Well, without question.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.214
But I love her.

08:11.313 --> 08:15.615
And despite her eccentricities,

08:15.714 --> 08:17.714
I know that she loves me too.

08:19.995 --> 08:21.855
Before you got married, were you scared?

08:21.955 --> 08:22.714
I think the only thing I was scared of

08:22.714 --> 08:24.795
was that I might lose her.

08:25.635 --> 08:29.435
I suppose that's how I
knew that she was the one.

08:33.355 --> 08:36.175
Anyway! I think all of this is fine.

08:36.275 --> 08:38.615
Just make sure this nut
here is nice and tight.

08:38.714 --> 08:40.255
I'm going out.

08:40.355 --> 08:41.255
What?

08:41.355 --> 08:45.035
(light gentle upbeat music)

08:47.995 --> 08:50.995
(singer vocalising)

09:18.516 --> 09:20.576
Hey.

09:20.675 --> 09:22.675
Hey.

09:23.356 --> 09:24.216
Um.

09:24.316 --> 09:26.476
Dee invited me. She texted me earlier.

09:29.476 --> 09:32.656
Yeah, sounds about right.

09:32.756 --> 09:33.536
So, how are you?

09:33.636 --> 09:37.296
Aside from clearly being
shocked by how overdressed I am.

09:37.396 --> 09:39.876
(chuckles) Um.

09:42.195 --> 09:44.195
Ben, I need to talk to you.

09:44.916 --> 09:47.916
(people chattering)

10:03.597 --> 10:04.896
Okay, I need to tell you something

10:04.997 --> 10:06.337
'cause I need to know
how you feel right now.

10:06.436 --> 10:09.537
Look, Emma, I don't really
know what you wanna talk about,

10:09.637 --> 10:11.577
but now isn't a good time.

10:11.676 --> 10:13.676
When Joey died, I was a mess.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.977
I started seeing someone. Harry.

10:17.077 --> 10:17.896
Okay.

10:17.997 --> 10:20.017
And I didn't think that I
would ever feel happy again,

10:20.117 --> 10:21.617
so I didn't really try.

10:21.717 --> 10:22.457
Right.

10:22.557 --> 10:24.557
We got engaged.

10:25.717 --> 10:27.656
Anyway, he had to go away
for a while for work.

10:27.757 --> 10:28.777
Is he all right?

10:28.877 --> 10:30.877
Yeah, he's fine.

10:33.038 --> 10:35.117
Ben, this summer with you was amazing.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.018
Just being with you felt like

10:38.117 --> 10:40.117
nothing that I've ever felt before.

10:42.478 --> 10:43.938
You made me realise that everybody

10:44.038 --> 10:45.377
has a moment in their
lives that changes them.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.918
Hang on. When did you break up with him?

10:49.877 --> 10:51.877
I didn't.

10:54.438 --> 10:56.438
I wanted to tell you.

10:57.358 --> 10:58.098
I tried to tell you.

10:58.198 --> 11:00.218
Are you still engaged to him?

11:00.318 --> 11:02.778
(gentle thoughtful music)

11:02.877 --> 11:06.538
I'm getting married
in a couple of weeks.

11:06.637 --> 11:09.538
I tried to tell you the
night Jack had his accident.

11:09.637 --> 11:10.897
But then, the next morning,

11:10.998 --> 11:13.438
you told me that you didn't
wanna see me anymore.

11:18.118 --> 11:19.858
I'm sorry, Ben. I'm so, so sorry.

11:19.959 --> 11:20.659
I tried to tell you.

11:20.759 --> 11:22.759
You were the first person since Jess...

11:24.959 --> 11:26.699
- I trusted you.
- It's not that simple.

11:26.799 --> 11:28.019
Why you telling me this now?

11:28.118 --> 11:31.019
Because I...

11:31.118 --> 11:33.519
Because I want you to
tell me not to do it.

11:36.999 --> 11:38.999
Ben, please, say something.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.999
Congratulations.

11:53.919 --> 11:58.919
(birds chirping)
(wind gently billowing)

12:07.720 --> 12:08.900
Stay still.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.940
Can you do it like Nanna?

12:11.040 --> 12:12.140
We don't have time, Poppy.

12:12.240 --> 12:16.380
And even if we did, can't
really do it like that.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.500
Please!

12:18.599 --> 12:20.599
I'm trying, Pops.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.280
(gentle emotive music)

12:28.079 --> 12:28.819
What's this for?

12:28.920 --> 12:30.920
You look sad.

12:50.601 --> 12:52.461
Are you sure?

12:52.560 --> 12:54.560
You have to be sure.

12:55.961 --> 12:58.141
I mean it, Emma.

12:58.241 --> 13:01.961
This is the single most important
decision you have to make.

13:03.281 --> 13:05.281
And you can still change your mind

13:06.560 --> 13:07.501
because the hem-

13:07.601 --> 13:09.601
I'm sure.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.141
Then this is it?

13:12.241 --> 13:14.241
This is it.

13:15.641 --> 13:17.641
I'm so happy.

13:17.961 --> 13:19.961
Joey would've loved it.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.800
Would she?

13:24.401 --> 13:25.861
Drink?

13:25.961 --> 13:27.981
Yeah.
(Hannah chuckles)

13:28.080 --> 13:29.221
(glasses clinking)

13:29.320 --> 13:31.322
I'm so proud of you.

13:40.962 --> 13:43.962
(people chattering)

13:51.642 --> 13:53.702
Emma! Emma!

13:53.801 --> 13:54.822
Guys!

13:54.922 --> 13:57.382
We're playing Peter Pan!

13:57.482 --> 14:00.301
Wow! Where's your daddy then?

14:00.402 --> 14:02.061
Is he in Neverland?

14:02.162 --> 14:03.422
No, he's at work.

14:03.521 --> 14:05.882
So who are you guys here with?

14:07.521 --> 14:09.521
Grandma.

14:11.402 --> 14:13.402
Hi, I'm Emma.

14:13.801 --> 14:15.803
Linda. Ben's Mum.

14:16.803 --> 14:18.803
Go on, you two. Bugger off.

14:19.123 --> 14:22.782
(children laughing)

14:22.883 --> 14:25.863
Look, I don't really understand

14:25.963 --> 14:27.703
what went on between the two of you,

14:27.803 --> 14:29.103
and it's probably not my place,

14:29.203 --> 14:32.803
but he was really upset when
he came back that night, Emma.

14:34.323 --> 14:35.782
I don't know what Ben said to you.

14:35.883 --> 14:37.883
He said you were someone special.

14:38.563 --> 14:41.583
And he's only ever said that
about one person before.

14:41.683 --> 14:43.262
He's got a lot to deal with.

14:43.363 --> 14:45.143
And he keeps telling me
that other people do it,

14:45.242 --> 14:47.223
other women do it, raise
two kids by themselves,

14:47.323 --> 14:49.502
and he's right, they do, but not like him.

14:49.603 --> 14:50.583
Not after what he's been through.

14:50.683 --> 14:52.262
And if you can't see that.

14:52.363 --> 14:54.303
I do see it.

14:54.403 --> 14:56.583
Okay.

14:56.683 --> 15:01.684
Right, well, let me tell you
something that you don't see.

15:03.284 --> 15:06.704
I know everything there
is to know about that boy.

15:06.804 --> 15:07.864
We speak every day,

15:07.963 --> 15:09.664
and I'm sure that doesn't sound very sexy,

15:09.764 --> 15:11.184
but it happens to be true,

15:11.284 --> 15:14.304
and the only thing in his entire life

15:14.404 --> 15:16.304
that he's ever kept from me,

15:16.404 --> 15:18.384
and bear in mind this is a
boy who rang me yesterday

15:18.483 --> 15:19.763
to tell let me know that
Poppy's bowel movements

15:19.763 --> 15:21.844
have becoming more consistent,

15:22.884 --> 15:25.503
is you.

15:25.604 --> 15:27.704
Are you saying I'm not important?

15:27.804 --> 15:31.184
(laughs) I'm saying

15:31.284 --> 15:33.763
that shows how incredibly
important you are.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.404
I was never gonna be Jess.

15:42.084 --> 15:43.384
No one is.

15:43.483 --> 15:45.565
And no one's ever gonna be you either.

15:48.165 --> 15:49.025
If you see him-

15:49.125 --> 15:52.125
I think I probably will, Emma,
I'm looking after his kids.

15:53.484 --> 15:55.385
When you see him,

15:55.484 --> 15:57.944
will you tell him I
think he's special too?

15:58.045 --> 16:02.185
(laughs) You do know you
could tell him yourself.

16:02.285 --> 16:04.385
(light thoughtful music)

16:04.484 --> 16:06.345
I really can't.

16:06.444 --> 16:08.444
I tried, and it didn't work.

16:16.525 --> 16:19.785
Has she gone to get Daddy?

16:19.885 --> 16:20.625
No.

16:20.724 --> 16:22.265
Why?

16:22.365 --> 16:24.365
I have no idea.

16:41.445 --> 16:44.925
(birds faintly squawking)

16:45.766 --> 16:46.586
Do it.

16:46.685 --> 16:47.546
You should do it, right?

16:47.646 --> 16:48.406
You should go through her DMs.

16:48.406 --> 16:49.205
I shouldn't have even told you about it.

16:49.205 --> 16:51.185
Can't believe you haven't
done this years ago.

16:51.286 --> 16:53.705
You don't know what it's
like, mate, all right!

16:53.806 --> 16:55.806
I know.

17:00.726 --> 17:02.466
I'm just saying,

17:02.566 --> 17:04.765
if I thought someone
might've cheated on me,

17:06.206 --> 17:08.206
I'd wanna know the truth.

17:10.005 --> 17:13.806
And as far as I can see,
there's only one way to do that.

17:16.447 --> 17:20.127
(gentle suspenseful music)

17:28.767 --> 17:32.367
She says, "We haven't
done that for a long time.

17:34.767 --> 17:36.767
"I feel terrible.

17:37.567 --> 17:39.107
"I'm so ashamed.

17:39.206 --> 17:41.206
"Please don't tell anyone."

17:43.327 --> 17:45.327
And what does he say?

17:46.287 --> 17:48.287
"Are you with him now?

17:49.847 --> 17:51.427
"Is he lying next to you?

17:51.527 --> 17:54.007
And then she says, "Please,
stop," and he says...

17:57.087 --> 17:58.466
"Don't tell him.

17:58.567 --> 18:01.388
"It's too big, he won't
be able to take it.

18:01.488 --> 18:03.488
"Don't tell, Ben."

18:04.008 --> 18:05.028
You should ring him.

18:05.128 --> 18:07.528
Right, you should ring
him and ask him outright.

18:13.368 --> 18:16.548
(phone line ringing)

18:16.648 --> 18:18.588
Hello.

18:18.687 --> 18:20.068
Hi. This is Ben.

18:20.168 --> 18:22.168
I'm- I'm Jess's...

18:23.888 --> 18:25.888
I'm Jack and Poppy's dad.

18:26.447 --> 18:28.908
Listen, Josh, can we meet up?

18:29.008 --> 18:30.788
(door clunking)

18:30.888 --> 18:32.707
Here we are, take a seat.

18:32.808 --> 18:33.988
(Hannah gasps)

18:34.088 --> 18:36.427
Remind me again what
wedding favours are?

18:36.528 --> 18:37.748
They're integral.

18:37.848 --> 18:38.548
Are they?

18:38.648 --> 18:39.908
I don't know.

18:40.008 --> 18:40.707
Thanks.

18:40.808 --> 18:42.628
Ooh, are you sure you want
to stay in your flat tonight?

18:42.727 --> 18:43.508
I'm sure.

18:43.608 --> 18:46.188
We need to talk
about the, uh, seating plan.

18:46.289 --> 18:47.349
Can we do this later?

18:47.448 --> 18:49.589
Emma, the wedding is tomorrow.

18:49.688 --> 18:50.428
I know.

18:50.529 --> 18:53.188
(Hannah scoffs)

18:53.289 --> 18:54.349
Right, let's get going.

18:54.448 --> 18:57.209
[Wedding Planner] Right,
Hannah, sorry. Just one second.

18:59.569 --> 19:01.269
[Harry] Can we talk about tomorrow?

19:01.369 --> 19:03.229
There's no point, Mum
has all the information.

19:03.329 --> 19:05.109
I know tomorrow you're
going to be thinking

19:05.209 --> 19:07.149
about someone else.

19:07.249 --> 19:10.489
(birds faintly cawing)

19:11.329 --> 19:13.329
Joey.

19:14.209 --> 19:18.529
And that's okay, but I
still want you to enjoy it.

19:19.769 --> 19:22.209
You're allowed to be happy, Emma.

19:23.928 --> 19:25.928
It's really not that easy.

19:26.448 --> 19:28.448
I think it is.

19:30.450 --> 19:35.330
Just think, this time tomorrow,
we're going to be married.

19:36.770 --> 19:38.430
(Harry laughs)

19:38.530 --> 19:41.970
(light thoughtful music)

20:10.730 --> 20:14.971
(light thoughtful music continues)

20:38.771 --> 20:41.771
(singer vocalising)

20:47.130 --> 20:48.591
Ben?

20:48.691 --> 20:51.271
(people chattering)

20:51.370 --> 20:53.370
Yeah.

20:54.251 --> 20:55.151
Thanks for coming.

20:55.251 --> 20:55.991
Can I get you a drink?

20:56.091 --> 20:58.091
I just wanna ask you something.

20:59.452 --> 21:01.952
Um, okay.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.052
Uh, yeah.

21:05.492 --> 21:08.712
When you rang me, I started to wonder why.

21:08.812 --> 21:09.572
Like, what you might wanna ask me.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.272
I wanna ask you about some messages

21:11.371 --> 21:12.831
that I found on Jess's phone.

21:12.932 --> 21:14.111
Between you and her.

21:14.212 --> 21:14.912
Can I say-

21:15.012 --> 21:17.012
Look, Jess was my best friend.

21:17.892 --> 21:19.392
We talked, and we talked,

21:19.492 --> 21:22.292
and I thought I knew everything
about her, but I didn't.

21:24.892 --> 21:26.892
We loved each other.

21:27.572 --> 21:29.552
What we had was special.

21:29.652 --> 21:31.872
And the people that we made are special.

21:31.972 --> 21:32.672
But I need to know-

21:32.772 --> 21:33.752
- Can I say something?
- No, just wait.

21:33.851 --> 21:34.992
I'm gay.

21:35.091 --> 21:40.091
What?

21:44.091 --> 21:45.793
(bright string music)

21:45.893 --> 21:48.733
(doors clunking)

22:30.894 --> 22:33.634
That night I met up with Jess,

22:33.734 --> 22:34.994
that's what I wanted to tell her.

22:35.094 --> 22:36.674
But I thought you went out with her?

22:36.774 --> 22:37.634
I did.

22:37.734 --> 22:38.514
I went out with a few girls

22:38.614 --> 22:41.354
and I was gay when I went
out with all of them.

22:41.454 --> 22:42.793
You seem confused.

22:42.894 --> 22:45.274
Well, it's just I read these
messages between you both,

22:45.374 --> 22:46.114
about that night.

22:46.214 --> 22:48.553
Yeah, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about.

22:48.654 --> 22:51.793
They said stuff like, "You
were amazing last night."

22:51.894 --> 22:53.954
When I came out to her, she was.

22:54.053 --> 22:56.514
"We haven't done that for a long time.

22:56.614 --> 22:57.914
"I'm so ashamed.

22:58.014 --> 22:59.954
"Please don't tell anyone."

23:00.053 --> 23:02.274
We drank tequila and
she was sick in a taxi.

23:02.374 --> 23:05.014
(both laughing)

23:09.894 --> 23:11.894
Okay.

23:13.533 --> 23:14.955
Well, you put, um...

23:15.055 --> 23:19.835
Wait, but what about you
saying, "Are you with him now?

23:19.935 --> 23:21.274
"Is he lying next to you?

23:21.375 --> 23:23.375
"Don't tell, Ben."

23:24.294 --> 23:26.294
That's harder to explain.

23:27.055 --> 23:30.955
So, Jess was talking about you a lot,

23:31.055 --> 23:34.034
and she showed me a picture of you.

23:34.135 --> 23:37.495
And I might have implied
I thought you were

23:39.534 --> 23:41.115
quite attractive.

23:41.215 --> 23:42.635
It became a bit of a joke.

23:42.735 --> 23:45.195
Um, so, (chuckles) "Are you with him now?

23:45.294 --> 23:47.355
"Is he lying next to you?

23:47.455 --> 23:49.635
"Don't tell Ben"

23:49.735 --> 23:53.075
that, essentially, I wanna shag him.

23:53.175 --> 23:56.034
(Ben laughs)

23:56.135 --> 23:58.774
(both laughing)

24:01.776 --> 24:03.235
Wait, so, when you said

24:03.336 --> 24:07.036
that, "It's too big and he
won't be able to take it,"

24:07.136 --> 24:07.876
you were talking about-

24:07.975 --> 24:09.156
- Yeah.
- Right.

24:09.255 --> 24:11.936
(both laughing)

24:14.216 --> 24:15.956
How do you feel?

24:16.056 --> 24:17.995
I mean flattered, obviously, but...

24:18.096 --> 24:20.156
(both laughing)

24:20.255 --> 24:22.716
Um, yeah, mainly I feel like an idiot.

24:22.816 --> 24:25.396
If you thought for one
second Jess would cheat on you,

24:25.495 --> 24:27.636
you should.

24:27.735 --> 24:29.936
(laughs) Yeah.

24:30.975 --> 24:33.636
(light gentle music)

24:33.735 --> 24:37.116
And do you, Emma, take this man

24:37.216 --> 24:39.755
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

24:39.856 --> 24:43.936
to have and to hold, as
long as you both shall live?

24:56.216 --> 24:59.697
(light thought pop music)

25:03.456 --> 25:06.456
(singer vocalising)

25:26.417 --> 25:29.578
(gentle peppy music)
