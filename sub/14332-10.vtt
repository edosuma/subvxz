MY BOSS, MR. ED LEADLY, IS
COMING OVER FOR DINNER TONIGHT,

01:10.837 --> 01:11.805
AND I WANT TO IMPRESS HIM!

01:11.871 --> 01:13.206
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME SOONER?

01:13.273 --> 01:15.642
- I DID!
I USED THE MOST RELIABLE METHOD

01:15.708 --> 01:16.843
OF COMMUNICATION I KNOW:

01:16.910 --> 01:18.144
SEMAPHORE FLAGS.

IT'S JUST LIKE TALKING
BUT WITH FLAGS

01:19.879 --> 01:21.681
AND NO WORDS.
[doorbell rings]

01:21.748 --> 01:23.817
GAH!
MR. ED LEADLY'S HERE,

01:23.883 --> 01:26.419
AND SOME IDIOT RUINED THE FOOD
BY FLIPPING OVER THE TABLE.

01:26.486 --> 01:27.720
- DAD, THAT WAS YOU.

01:27.787 --> 01:29.122
- THERE'S NO TIME
FOR FINGER-POINTING.

01:29.189 --> 01:31.324
QUICK!
I'LL GO DISTRACT MR. ED LEADLY

01:31.391 --> 01:33.860
WHILE YOU WHIP UP
A DELICIOUS FIVE-COURSE MEAL.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.362
- FIVE COURSES?
OH, IT'S A GOOD THING

01:36.429 --> 01:37.964
I HAVE THIS HANDY COOKBOOK.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.799
- MOM, THAT'S A CAR MANUAL.

01:39.866 --> 01:43.470
- NONSENSE. NOW GO GET SOME
ANTIFREEZE FOR THE ANTIPASTO.

01:43.536 --> 01:47.273
- WELCOME TO MY IMPRESSIVE HOME,
MR. ED LEADLY.

ALLOW ME TO IMPRESS YOU
WITH MY MANY BOWLING TROPHIES.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.178

01:52.245 --> 01:53.446
YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN.

I BOUGHT THEM FROM WAS.

UNLIKE ME, SHE WAS
A VERY ACCOMPLISHED LADY.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.186

YOU KNOCKED HIS SOCKS OFF.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.999
THERE'S MORE
WHERE THIS CAME FROM.

I TOOK ALL FOUR TIRES
FROM THAT FANCY CAR OUT FRONT.

SOMETHING MR. LEADLY

02:34.521 --> 02:36.623

THAT ACTUALLY SMELLS EDIBLE.

WOW, THIS IS THE BEST STEAK
I'VE EVER HAD.

02:45.698 --> 02:47.767
IT ALMOST MAKES UP FOR THE
BUCKET OF SHARPENED PENCILS

WHEN I LIKE SOMETHING--

03:15.528 --> 03:16.629
BUY IT.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.998
I'LL OFFER YOU $17 MILLION
FOR HIM.

03:19.065 --> 03:21.301
- SOLD! FOR $17 MILLION,
I'LL THROW IN

MY WOMEN'S BOWLING TROPHIES
AND THE PENCILS IN THE BASEMENT

03:23.736 --> 03:25.438
I DID NOT STEAL FROM MY WORK.

03:25.505 --> 03:26.639
- DAD, NO!

03:26.706 --> 03:27.974
SORRY, MR. LEADLY,

03:28.041 --> 03:29.609
BUT SPARKY'S NOT FOR SALE.

03:29.676 --> 03:32.545
HE'S MY DOG,
AND I LOVE HIM.

03:34.914 --> 03:37.250
- NO, DAD.
YOU CAN'T SELL SPARKY.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.285

03:39.352 --> 03:41.321
BUT, IF THAT DOG MAKES
MY SON TIMMY HAPPY,

03:41.387 --> 03:43.256
THEN I CAN'T SELL HIM TO YOU.

03:43.323 --> 03:46.025
EVEN THOUGH MY SON DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE TOO CONCERNED

03:46.092 --> 03:48.561
WITH ME BEING HAPPY.

"NOT GETTING MY DOG" THING.

ON A COMPLETELY UNRELATED NOTE,

04:16.356 --> 04:18.491
I'M FURIOUS, AND I'VE GOT
A SUPER DANGEROUS

04:18.558 --> 04:20.660
AND HOPEFULLY PAINFUL JOB
FOR YOU.

04:20.726 --> 04:21.761
- THANKS, MR. ED LEADLY,

04:21.827 --> 04:23.229
BUT I'M ALREADY MARRIED.

04:23.296 --> 04:24.964
- I'M NOT GONNA MARRY YOU.

04:25.031 --> 04:26.899
I'M PUTTING YOU
IN THE PENCIL TESTING ROOM

04:26.966 --> 04:28.868
WHERE YOU'LL BE TESTING
THE DURABILITY OF PENCILS

04:28.935 --> 04:31.437
AND REGRETTING NOT GIVING ME
YOUR DOG.

THESE PENCILS ARE AMAZING.

04:47.854 --> 04:49.689
NONE OF THEM BROKE.

04:49.756 --> 04:51.257
TO TURN UP THE HEAT.

04:51.324 --> 04:52.692
WHICH IS IRONIC,
BECAUSE I'M SENDING YOU

THE DOG, TURNER?

05:05.838 --> 05:07.407
- NO, MR. ED LEADLY.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.808
YOU CAN TAKE MY DIGNITY--

05:08.875 --> 05:10.410
WELL, THE SNOW LEOPARD DID THAT.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.878
AND YOU CAN TAKE MY SPLEEN--

05:11.944 --> 05:13.913
WELL, THE SNOW LEOPARD
ALSO DID THAT.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.449
BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE
MY SON'S DOG.

- WELL, THEN, I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW AT 8:00 A.M.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.354
IN THE PENCI-FUGE.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.289
- OOH, DID YOU BUILT THAT
TO TEST PENCILS

05:23.356 --> 05:24.590
THAT ARE GOING INTO SPACE?

05:24.657 --> 05:25.958
YOU KNOW, SPACE PENCILS,

05:26.025 --> 05:28.127
OR "SPENCILS," IF YOU WILL.

05:28.194 --> 05:31.130
- NO, I BUILT IT
TO ABUSE EMPLOYEES.

05:31.197 --> 05:32.899
WHO SENDS PENCILS INTO SPACE?

05:32.965 --> 05:35.034
YOU'RE AN IDIOT, TURNER.

THERE'S A SNOW LEOPARD OUTSIDE?

05:40.006 --> 05:41.607
- YEAH, I RODE HIM HOME

05:41.674 --> 05:43.576
BECAUSE I HAD NO FEELING
IN MY LEGS.

05:43.643 --> 05:44.977
- DID MR. LEADLY DO THIS

05:45.044 --> 05:46.579
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T GIVE UP
SPARKY?

05:46.646 --> 05:48.014
- WELL, YES, TIMMY,

05:48.081 --> 05:49.749
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT
TO KEEP YOUR DOG.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.250
THERE WAS LIGHTNING
AND BULLS,

05:51.317 --> 05:53.286
AND TOMORROW
I BECOME A SPACE PENCIL.

05:53.352 --> 05:56.823
OR A "SPENCIL,"
IF YOU WILL.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.891
- I FEEL TERRIBLE
FOR MY DAD.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.894
HIS BOSS IS TORTURING HIM
FOR NOT GIVING UP SPARKY.

06:01.961 --> 06:04.597
- OH, IF ONLY THERE WAS A WAY
FOR YOU AND MR. LEADLY

06:04.664 --> 06:06.432
TO BOTH HAVE SPARKY.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.601
- THERE IS.
WE'LL JUST PRETEND TO GIVE YOU

06:08.668 --> 06:10.303
TO MR. LEADLY,
AND YOU COULD JUST POOF HOME

06:10.369 --> 06:11.437
WHEN HE'S NOT AROUND.

06:11.504 --> 06:13.139
- OOH, WHAT A COINCIDENCE,
TIMMY.

06:13.206 --> 06:17.376
WHENEVER YOU'RE NOT AROUND, I
POOF OVER TO MR. LEADLY'S HOUSE.

06:17.443 --> 06:20.279
HEY, LEADLY,
STOP HOGGING THE JETS.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.915
- [screams]
THE HOT TUB GHOST IS BACK!

06:22.982 --> 06:26.052
- TIMMY, SHARING ME
WITH MR. LEADLY IS A GREAT IDEA.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.453
- YOU'LL LOVE HIS PLACE.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.855
BUT BRING YOUR OWN SWIMSUIT.

06:28.921 --> 06:30.523
MR. LEADLY DOES NOT LIKE IT

06:30.590 --> 06:32.558
WHEN YOU USE HIS HOT TUB
IN THE BUFF.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.993
- [whimpering]

06:34.060 --> 06:36.229
OH, TIMMY, I'M SO NERVOUS
ABOUT GOING TO WORK

06:36.295 --> 06:37.864
THAT I'VE RUN OUT OF NAILS
TO BITE.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.433
I STARTED GNAWING ON THESE
PENCILS I DID NOT STEAL.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.935
- DAD, IT'S OKAY, 'CAUSE--
- COME ON, TURNER.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.772
I WANT TO TAKE YOU
FOR A BIG, GREASY BREAKFAST

06:45.838 --> 06:48.007
BEFORE I PUT YOU
IN THE PENCI-FUGE.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.209
- THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY,
MR. LEADLY.

06:50.276 --> 06:52.178
I'VE DECIDED TO GIVE YOU MY DOG

06:52.245 --> 06:53.846
SO YOU'LL STOP BEING MEAN
TO MY DAD.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.817
- OH, TIMMY,
I CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.452
[sobs]
QUICK, TAKE THE DOG

06:59.519 --> 07:00.987
BEFORE THE BOY CHANGES HIS MIND.

07:01.053 --> 07:03.456
- SO YOU'RE GONNA LET ME
TAKE YOUR SON'S DOG, HUH?

07:03.523 --> 07:05.291
WOW.
YOU'RE SPINELESS.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.226
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE I DROPPED
A PIANO ON YOU.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.362
- THERE'S NO WINNING
WITH YOU!

07:13.166 --> 07:15.935
THANK YOU, TIMMY.
YOU'RE A GOOD SON.

07:16.002 --> 07:19.605
NOW CLOSE YOUR EYES.
I'M SAYING SOME OFF-COLOR THINGS

07:19.672 --> 07:22.708
TO MR. ED LEADLY.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.043
- WELL, IT'S GETTING LATE.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.845
MR. LEADLY SHOULD BE GOING
TO BED SOON.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.547
SPARKY SHOULD BE BACK
ANY MINUTE.

07:27.613 --> 07:31.651
- OOH, IF MR. LEADLY'S GOING
TO BED, I'M HITTING THE HOT TUB

07:31.717 --> 07:33.853
WEARING ONLY A SMILE.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.791
- THAT WAS A NICE THING
YOU TWO DID

07:38.858 --> 07:39.792
FOR YOUR DAD.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.194
- IT WAS NO BIG DEAL, WANDA.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.729
BESIDES, WHAT COULD
POSSIBLY GO WRONG?

07:43.796 --> 07:46.499
- WELL, I DID HAVE AN ACCIDENT
ON MR. LEADLY'S LAWN.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.534
I DROVE HIS SPORTS CAR
INTO A TREE.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.736
IT'S OKAY.
HE BLAMED THE HOT TUB GHOST.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.072
- ANYWAY,
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU TWO DID,

07:53.139 --> 07:55.708
YOUR DAD'S GONNA SLEEP
PEACEFULLY TONIGHT.

07:55.775 --> 07:56.876
- [whimpers]

07:56.943 --> 07:59.846
- YOU LET ME TAKE
YOUR SON'S DOG.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.916
YOU'RE SPINELESS.
YOU'RE SPINELESS.

08:05.418 --> 08:08.521
- YOU'RE SPINELESS.
- OH, GREAT.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.923
SHE'S DOING IMPERSONATIONS
IN HER SLEEP AGAIN.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.727
[groans] I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT GIVING UP TIMMY'S DOG.

08:14.794 --> 08:16.062
WELL, I'M SURE
IT'LL PASS.

08:16.128 --> 08:19.198
OH, NO, IT'S PASSING
RIGHT BY THE DOOR.

08:21.734 --> 08:24.170
OOH, I SMELL GENERAL MAO'S
ORANGE CHICKEN.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.938
THAT'S SPARKY'S
FAVORITE MIDNIGHT SNACK.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.774
WHAT KIND OF VOODOO IS THIS?

08:28.841 --> 08:33.546
SPARKY? MY GUILTY MIND
IS PLAYING TRICKS ON ME.

08:33.613 --> 08:36.182
- YES.
YOU'RE SEEING THINGS.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.717
I'M JUST GONNA PACK UP
THIS CHICKEN TO GO.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.919
I MEAN, I'M NOT HERE.

17:33.685 --> 17:36.488
- SUCK IT IN, MOTHER.
I'M COMING.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.625
- I CAN'T BELIEVE MY FAMILY
TURNED OUT TO BE SO GREEDY.

17:39.691 --> 17:42.728
IT'S NO FUN BEING RICH
IF EVERYONE ELSE IS MISERABLE.

17:42.795 --> 17:47.232
COSMO, WANDA, I WISH
I COULD GO BACK TO MY OLD LIFE.

17:47.299 --> 17:50.102
JORGEN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:50.169 --> 17:52.971
- MISSING MY SPRAY-ON TAN
APPOINTMENT, THANKS TO YOU.

17:53.038 --> 17:55.307
- WHERE ARE COSMO, WANDA,
AND POOF?

17:55.374 --> 17:58.377
- HEY, YOUR LIFE IS SO GOOD NOW,
YOU DO NOT NEED FAIRIES.

17:58.444 --> 17:59.578
I ONLY LET YOU KEEP THE DOG

17:59.645 --> 18:01.046
BECAUSE HE'S A PAIN
IN THE BUTT.

18:01.113 --> 18:03.315
- SPEAKING OF BUTTS,
I HOPE YOU LIKE SNIFFING 'EM

18:03.382 --> 18:05.517
'CAUSE THE REVOLUTION'S
COMING, MAN.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.553
- I CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT MY FAIRIES.

18:07.619 --> 18:09.087
TO GET COSMO AND WANDA BACK,

18:09.154 --> 18:11.323
I'LL HAVE TO MAKE
MY LIFE MISERABLE.

18:11.390 --> 18:12.958
[car horn beeps]

18:13.025 --> 18:15.561
- TIMMY, THIS IS A PRESENT
FROM YOUR FATHER.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.696
HE SAYS, "HAPPY TUESDAY."

18:17.763 --> 18:20.899
- COOL!
WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT AGAIN?

18:20.966 --> 18:22.367
- YAY!

18:22.434 --> 18:25.904
- GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT MISERABLE LIFE THING!

18:25.971 --> 18:28.006
- OKAY, I NEED TO FOCUS.

18:28.073 --> 18:30.676
I'LL STOP EATING,
AND THAT'LL MAKE MY LIFE STINK.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.845
THEN COSMO AND WANDA
WILL HAVE TO COME BACK.

18:32.911 --> 18:33.879
[train horn blasts]

18:33.946 --> 18:34.880
- HAVE SOME CANDY.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.148
IT'S WRAPPED IN MONEY.

18:36.215 --> 18:37.549
both: YAY!

18:37.616 --> 18:39.785
- WHAT WAS I SAYING AGAIN?

18:41.753 --> 18:43.155
OKAY, NEW PLAN.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.691
I'LL JUST GIVE AWAY
ALL OF MY COOL STUFF.

18:45.757 --> 18:49.127
COME AND GET
YOUR FREE, COOL STUFF!

18:49.194 --> 18:52.764
all: YAY!
COOL STUFF!

18:52.831 --> 18:56.201
- IT WORKED.
I'VE GOT NOTHING.

18:56.268 --> 18:58.770
- TIMMY, SINCE YOU GOT RID
OF ALL YOUR COOL STUFF,

18:58.837 --> 19:01.440
I GOT YOU EVEN COOLER STUFF.

19:01.507 --> 19:03.575
HAPPY 3:45 IN THE AFTERNOON!

19:03.642 --> 19:07.179
- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE
MISERABLE WHEN YOU'RE RICH.

19:07.246 --> 19:10.148
I WONDER WHAT I GET
AT 4:00.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.752
- HOLD ON.
I'M IN THE CAN.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.287
WHAT DO YOU WANT, TURNER?

19:15.354 --> 19:17.990
ARE YOU HERE TO INSULT ME
WITH ANOTHER CLEVER PUN?

19:18.056 --> 19:21.026
- MR. CROCKER, I WANT
TO HELP YOU START A REVOLUTION

19:21.093 --> 19:22.160
AGAINST MY DAD.

19:22.227 --> 19:23.428
- I DON'T KNOW, TURNER.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.497
WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU?

19:25.564 --> 19:26.832
- IF WE DEFEAT MY DAD,

19:26.899 --> 19:28.834
YOU WON'T HAVE
TO LIVE IN A CAN ANYMORE.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.435
- ACTUALLY, THE CAN'S
NOT SO BAD.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.803
JUST HAD THE KITCHEN REDONE.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.572
- BUT YOU WON'T HAVE
TO LIVE WITH YOUR MOM.

19:33.639 --> 19:36.308
- LET THE REVOLUTION BEGIN.

19:36.375 --> 19:39.144
[all shouting]

19:39.211 --> 19:41.813
THANKS FOR LOANING US THE
TORCHES AND PITCHFORKS, SPARKY.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.517
- NO PROBLEM, BUT I'LL NEED THEM
BACK FOR A THING I GOT LATER.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.052
- TO THE TURNER POWER PLANT.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.721
TIME TO DERAIL
TIMMY'S EVIL DAD.

19:51.890 --> 19:54.660
I'VE SPENT YEARS STUDYING
HOW TO DESTROY THIS POWER PLANT.

19:54.726 --> 19:57.563
FINALLY, MY LIFE'S WORK
IS GOING TO PAY OFF.

19:57.629 --> 20:00.933
- OR WE COULD JUST HIT
THE OFF BUTTON.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.102
all: YAY!

20:04.169 --> 20:05.571
- THAT WAS IT?

20:05.637 --> 20:07.940
I COULD HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED
AND HAD A FAMILY.

20:08.006 --> 20:09.875
THEN AGAIN I WOULD HAVE HAD
TO FIND A WOMAN WHO WANTED

20:09.942 --> 20:11.743
TO LIVE IN A TRASH CAN.
GAH!

20:11.810 --> 20:13.178
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN
A BIT OF A HURDLE.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.180
[train horn blasts]

20:15.247 --> 20:17.349
- OH, NO.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.517
MY TRAINS HAVE STOPPED.

20:18.584 --> 20:19.985
I'VE BEEN RIDING
IN THEM SO LONG,

20:20.052 --> 20:21.086
I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO WALK.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.621
MERMAN, STOP GOING
TO THE BATHROOM

20:22.688 --> 20:24.489
FOR TIMMY
AND CARRY ME TO MY YACHT.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.224
[zipper zipping]
- SIR. SORRY, SIR.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.760
- YAY!, MY LIFE'S
GONNA STINK AGAIN!

20:28.827 --> 20:30.062
- YOU DID IT, TURNER.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.064
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW TO THANK YOU.

20:32.130 --> 20:35.233
- I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED
A MUFFIN BASKET.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.535
- I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT,

20:36.602 --> 20:38.537
BUT I WENT
WITH ANNIHILATING YOU INSTEAD.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.939
- WHY?
- I'M IN CHARGE NOW!

20:41.006 --> 20:43.642
POWER'S GONE TO MY HEAD.
SEE THAT TRAIN?

20:43.709 --> 20:46.645
I'M GONNA HOP ON IT
AND RUN YOU OVER!

20:46.712 --> 20:50.148
[laughs maniacally]

20:53.585 --> 20:54.820
- OH, NO, I'M DOOMED.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.756
THIS IS THE MOST MISERABLE
I'VE EVER BEEN!

20:57.823 --> 21:00.292
- HI, WE'RE COSMO AND WANDA,

21:00.359 --> 21:01.760
AND THIS IS OUR BABY POOF.

21:01.827 --> 21:03.528
WE'RE YOUR NEW FAIRIES.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.864
I'M SURE YOU HAVE
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.833
- NO, I'M GOOD.
JUST GET ME OUT OF HERE!

21:07.899 --> 21:09.801
- OKAY, BUT FIRST WE NEED TO GO

21:09.868 --> 21:12.170
THROUGH THIS THOUSAND-PAGE
FAIRY RULE BOOK.

21:12.237 --> 21:15.374
"CHAPTER ONE:
WHAT IS A FAIRY?"

21:15.440 --> 21:16.375
- [laughs maniacally]

21:16.441 --> 21:17.809
- CAN WE MOVE THIS THING ALONG?

21:17.876 --> 21:20.579
- OKAY, IF YOU COULD JUST SIGN
THIS FAIRY CONTRACT

21:20.646 --> 21:22.881
HERE, HERE, AND HERE.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.017
- MY HANDS ARE TIED!

21:25.083 --> 21:27.686
- OH, RIGHT, SORRY.

21:29.087 --> 21:30.055
[writing]

21:30.122 --> 21:31.189
- [spits]

21:31.256 --> 21:33.058
GUYS, I WISH MY LIFE WAS BACK

21:33.125 --> 21:35.494
TO THE WAY IT WAS
BEFORE I MADE MY WISH.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.596
- WHAT WISH?
- JUST DO IT!

21:37.663 --> 21:38.764
[train horn blares]

21:38.830 --> 21:42.367
[screams]

21:43.969 --> 21:46.505
OH, YAY!

21:46.571 --> 21:48.040
IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME.

21:48.106 --> 21:50.375
I DON'T NEED MY DAD
TO BE A RAILROAD TYCOON.

21:50.442 --> 21:53.278
MY LIFE IS PERFECT
JUST THE WAY IT IS.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.914
- HELP, TIMMY!
MY FLAB BLASTER BACKFIRED ON ME!

21:55.981 --> 21:57.182
[shouts]

21:57.249 --> 21:59.351
- OKAY, PERFECT MAY NOT BE
THE BEST WORD.

21:59.418 --> 22:01.653
- HEY, TIMMY,
YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM ME,

22:01.720 --> 22:04.156
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE TOWN
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

22:04.222 --> 22:05.624
- THAT'S A SHAME, SPARKY.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.726
I THOUGHT WE'D GO GET
SOME PIZZA.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.362
MY TREAT.
- OH, PIZZA.

22:10.429 --> 22:12.264
THIS IS ALPHA DOG
TO RED LEADER.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.700
ABORT MUTT RISING.
ABORT! ABORT!

22:14.766 --> 22:18.003
[dogs barking]

22:18.070 --> 22:20.639
- IT'S A LITTLE LATE.
