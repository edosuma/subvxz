WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:04.166
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

00:04.166 --> 00:05.875
YOU ONLY JUST MET ME.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.500
I KNOW YOU'RE A SNAKE
AND A CON ARTIST.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.750
I KNOW YOU'VE
SLEPT YOUR WAY

00:08.750 --> 00:10.208
THROUGH THE
FEMALE STUDENT BODY

00:10.208 --> 00:11.500
AND HALF THE FACULTY.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.166
THE KIND OF BOY
WHO'LL BREAK YOUR HEART

00:13.166 --> 00:15.041
AND THEN START IN
ON YOUR SISTER

00:17.375 --> 00:18.333
AHH.

00:18.333 --> 00:21.000
YOU MUST BE CONFUSED.
UNDERSTANDABLE.

00:21.000 --> 00:21.834
IT'S A COMMON AFFLICTION
AMONG BLONDES.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.750
UGH.
TRUTH IS,

00:24.750 --> 00:25.875
I'M NONE OF THOSE THINGS.

00:25.875 --> 00:27.667
OH, YEAH?

00:27.667 --> 00:29.333
THEN WHO ARE YOU?

00:29.333 --> 00:32.583
I'M JUST THE BOY THAT'S
GONNA TEAR YOUR SOUL APART.

00:35.333 --> 00:38.291
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I CAN'T DO THIS.

00:38.291 --> 00:40.250
AH, CUT. I GUESS.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.542
AMATEURS.
I'M SURROUNDED BY AMATEURS.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.417
WILL YOU JUST
RUN WITH ME HERE
FOR A SECOND.

00:44.417 --> 00:46.917
IF I WERE A GIRL
TRYING TO SEDUCE A BOY--

00:46.917 --> 00:49.250
AND TRUST ME, OK,
I'VE BEEN THAT GIRL
MANY TIMES--

00:49.250 --> 00:51.208
I WOULD NEVER
LET HIM KNOW
HOW MUCH I WANT HIM.

00:51.208 --> 00:52.458
NEVER. EVER. I MEAN,

00:52.458 --> 00:53.708
THAT'S THE MOMENT
WHEN THEY LOSE INTEREST.

00:53.708 --> 00:56.375
SORRY, IT'S JUST--
IT'S FEEBLE WRITING.

00:56.375 --> 00:59.250
HEY, HEY. I'M RIGHT HERE.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.708
WE SHOULD'VE MADE
AN ANIMATED MOVIE.

01:01.708 --> 01:02.959
WOULDA-COULDA-SHOULDA.

01:02.959 --> 01:04.041
HMM.

01:04.041 --> 01:07.083
ALL RIGHT.

01:07.083 --> 01:08.959
AUDREY...

01:10.708 --> 01:12.708
YOU GOTTA PENETRATE
THE SUBTEXT, OK?

01:12.708 --> 01:13.917
REMEMBER, SHE KNOWS
THAT HE KNOWS THAT SHE KNOWS

01:13.917 --> 01:15.041
WHAT KIND OF MAN HE IS.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.208
SO IF HE KNOWS
THAT SHE KNOWS

01:17.208 --> 01:18.667
AND SHE KNOWS
THAT HE KNOWS...

01:18.667 --> 01:20.083
SEE WHAT I'M GETTING AT?

01:20.083 --> 01:22.000
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT. GREAT.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.208
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SHOOT THE SCENE

01:23.208 --> 01:25.542
BEFORE WE GET OLD
AND DIE IN OUR SLEEP.

01:27.625 --> 01:30.000
OK. BACK TO ONE, PEOPLE.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.750
OH, I'M SORRY.

01:34.750 --> 01:37.333
AH, PACE, IF YOU DON'T
SWING THE MICROPHONE,

01:37.333 --> 01:39.583
YOU RUN LESS OF A RISK
OF DIPPING INTO MY SHOT,

01:39.583 --> 01:42.750
WHICH, I THINK, WOULD
DETRACT FROM THE OVERALL
REALITY OF THE PICTURE.

01:42.750 --> 01:45.000
GOTCHA. IT'LL BE
PERFECT THIS TIME.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.375
ALL RIGHT. PICTURE'S UP.

01:55.083 --> 01:57.750
OK. WE ARE ROLLING.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.834
MARKER.

01:59.834 --> 02:02.417
27 APPLE, TAKE 3.

02:07.125 --> 02:09.583
AND...

02:09.583 --> 02:10.542
ACTION.

02:56.458 --> 02:58.792
REMEMBER,
THERE IS NO DISTINCTION

02:58.792 --> 03:01.083
BETWEEN WRITING A STORY
AND LIVING YOUR LIFE.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.667
THE SAME ELEMENTS THAT MAKE
A MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE

03:03.667 --> 03:06.500
IGNITE, EXPLODE, MOVE--
THESE SAME THINGS

03:06.500 --> 03:10.000
MAKE A SCENE
IN YOUR WRITING HAVE LIFE.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.417
WHEN A WRITER HAS
EVOLVED IN THEIR WORK,

03:11.417 --> 03:14.000
THEY'VE EVOLVED
AS AN INDIVIDUAL.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.083
WHEN THE WORK IS INTENSE,

03:15.083 --> 03:17.625
IT IS BECAUSE
THEIR LIFE IS INTENSE.

03:17.625 --> 03:18.375
SO THE REAL QUESTION IS,

03:18.375 --> 03:21.208
"WHAT MAKES LIFE INTENSE?"

03:21.208 --> 03:22.667
CONFLICT. WHAT IS CONFLICT?

03:22.667 --> 03:25.625
THE ESSENTIAL CONFLICT
AT THE CORE OF THE ARTIST?

03:25.625 --> 03:27.667
UH, THINK OF THE MOVIES
YOU'VE SEEN,

03:27.667 --> 03:29.417
SONGS YOU'VE HEARD,
BOOKS YOU'VE READ.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.667
"TO BE OR NOT TO BE."
BINGO.

03:31.667 --> 03:32.708
IN OTHER WORDS,

03:32.708 --> 03:34.125
YOUR DESIRES
VERSUS YOUR IDEALS.

03:34.125 --> 03:36.750
YOUR HEAD, OR YOUR HEART.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.208
CAN SOMEBODY
GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE,

03:38.208 --> 03:40.083
USING THEIR OWN LIFE,
OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN

03:40.083 --> 03:42.083
THEIR DESIRES
AND THEIR IDEALS?

03:43.208 --> 03:44.750
I HAVE AN EXAMPLE.

03:47.083 --> 03:47.875
OUT WITH IT THEN.

03:47.875 --> 03:51.041
WELL, IT'S UM...

03:51.041 --> 03:53.041
IT'S ABOUT A GUY.

03:53.041 --> 03:55.000
AH, OF COURSE.
ISN'T IT ALWAYS?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.625
[LAUGHS]

03:57.625 --> 03:58.375
[BELL RINGS]

03:58.375 --> 04:00.083
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

04:00.083 --> 04:01.792
I WAS CURIOUS WHERE
YOUR STORY WAS GOING.

04:01.792 --> 04:04.667
YOU'LL HAVE TO SHARE
WITH US NEXT WEEK.

04:04.667 --> 04:06.375
"SAME BAT TIME.
SAME BAT CHANNEL."

04:15.875 --> 04:17.083
WE NEED TO TALK.

04:17.083 --> 04:17.916
WE DO?

04:17.916 --> 04:19.583
YES. THAT WAS
UNCOMFORTABLE.

04:19.583 --> 04:20.166
NO, THAT WAS
CREATIVE WRITING.

04:20.166 --> 04:22.083
"UNCOMFORTABLE"

04:22.083 --> 04:23.500
IS TAUGHT DOWN THE
HALL ON THE LEFT.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.250
THERE SHOULD BE
A WORD FOR PEOPLE

04:25.250 --> 04:26.083
WHO USE SARCASM
AS A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

04:26.083 --> 04:27.834
THERE IS. SARCASTIC.

04:27.834 --> 04:30.208
I'M SERIOUS.

04:30.208 --> 04:31.417
ARE YOU OK?

04:31.417 --> 04:33.583
I'M FINE. I...

04:33.583 --> 04:35.750
I MEAN, I'D BE LYING
IF I SAID I WASN'T

04:35.750 --> 04:37.750
A LITTLE WEIRDED OUT
BY RECENT EVENTS.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.625
I'M SORRY, JOEY.
I'M A CREEP. I...

04:40.625 --> 04:42.750
I'VE ROBBED YOU OF YOUR
INNOCENCE, HAVEN'T I?

04:42.750 --> 04:45.000
NO, YOU'RE NOT A CREEP.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.500
AND DON'T SAY YOU'RE SORRY,

04:46.500 --> 04:47.583
IT MAKES ME FEEL--

04:47.583 --> 04:49.125
CHEAP?

04:49.125 --> 04:50.125
NO.

04:50.125 --> 04:51.250
DIRTY?
NO.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.667
OK, I'M GONNA
STOP TALKING,

04:52.667 --> 04:53.834
BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,

04:53.834 --> 04:55.667
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
YOU WANNA SAY TO ME.

04:55.667 --> 04:58.291
MANY THINGS.
OK...

04:58.291 --> 05:00.166
I CAN'T PROMISE I'LL
HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.583
IN FACT, I CAN'T PROMISE
I'LL HAVE ANY ANSWERS,

05:01.583 --> 05:04.250
BUT I'M WILLING
TO GIVE IT A SHOT.

05:04.250 --> 05:07.750
THANK YOU.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.333
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

05:14.708 --> 05:16.458
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF
A LOTTA PRESSURE,

05:16.458 --> 05:17.792
AND I SEEM TO BE
FREEZING UP,

05:17.792 --> 05:18.959
SO CAN I DO THIS
ANOTHER TIME?

05:18.959 --> 05:20.417
ABSOLUTELY.

05:26.625 --> 05:29.041
YOU SLEPT HERE AGAIN
LAST NIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?

05:29.041 --> 05:29.917
DOESN'T THAT, LIKE,

05:29.917 --> 05:32.625
VIOLATE SOME
SORT OF HEALTH CODE?

05:32.625 --> 05:33.875
GOOD MORNING, AUDREY.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.583
I CAN ONLY ASSUME,
SINCE IT'S YOUR DAY OFF,

05:35.583 --> 05:37.917
THAT YOU CAME HERE
FOR A LITTLE BIT

05:37.917 --> 05:39.500
OF PLAYFUL BANTER
AND THE OPPORTUNITY

05:39.500 --> 05:40.208
TO CRITIQUE
MY PERSONAL HYGIENE.

05:40.208 --> 05:41.417
WHICH IS SWEET OF YOU,

05:41.417 --> 05:43.834
BUT YOU SHOULD
HAVE CALLED FIRST.

05:43.834 --> 05:44.959
CAN I HAVE
THAT OMELETTE?

05:44.959 --> 05:45.625
NO.

05:45.625 --> 05:47.583
WE HAD PLANS, YOU KNOW.

05:47.583 --> 05:48.583
YOU SAID YOU'D HELP ME.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.500
UH, RIGHT.
REFRESH MY MEMORY,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.166
THAT WAS THE BREAST
EXAM, RIGHT?

05:52.166 --> 05:53.458
NO. LEARNING MY LINES
FOR DAWSON'S MOVIE.

05:53.458 --> 05:56.166
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
LAST NIGHT, REMEMBER?

05:56.166 --> 05:57.417
ONLY VAGUELY.

05:57.417 --> 05:59.333
AND TO TELL YOU THE
GOD'S HONEST, AUDREY,

05:59.333 --> 06:02.875
NOW IS REALLY NOT
THE BEST TIME FOR ME.

06:02.875 --> 06:03.959
Girl:
GOOD MORNING.

06:03.959 --> 06:06.708
WHAT'S
FOR BREAKFAST?

06:06.708 --> 06:09.041
AUDREY, I WOULD LIKE
TO INTRODUCE YOU

06:09.041 --> 06:10.917
TO MY GOOD FRIEND GINA.

06:10.917 --> 06:12.792
EXCUSE ME?

06:12.792 --> 06:13.792
WHAT?

06:13.792 --> 06:15.667
WHAT'S MY NAME?

06:15.667 --> 06:16.375
[COUGH]-INA.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.750
MY NAME IS RINA.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.875
R-I-N-A.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.083
WHICH IS WHAT
I SAID, RINA.

06:22.083 --> 06:24.542
DIDN'T I SAY "RINA", AUDREY?
YOU SAID "GINA."

06:26.125 --> 06:28.708
THANK YOU.

06:28.708 --> 06:31.083
OH, COME ON, SWEETHEART,
DON'T LEAVE ANGRY.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.667
OR AT LEAST
DON'T DRIVE ANGRY.

06:32.667 --> 06:33.500
HAVE A NICE LIFE,
STACEY!

06:36.875 --> 06:39.041
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

06:39.041 --> 06:40.834
THE OMELETTE'S YOURS.

06:45.208 --> 06:48.250
Polar Bear: JACK.

06:48.250 --> 06:48.500
MORNING.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.750
AHEM. HOW'S IT GOING, BRO?

06:52.750 --> 06:55.667
Polar Bear: WE'RE HEARING
THERE'S A KEGGER

06:55.667 --> 06:57.125
AT THE KAPPA MU PI  SORORITY.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.250
SO THOSE OF YOU INTERESTED

06:58.250 --> 06:59.500
IN GETTING SOME
NOOKY THIS EVENING,

06:59.500 --> 07:02.750
WE SHOULD MEET BACK HERE
AT, LET'S SAY... 11:00?

07:02.750 --> 07:03.959
BREAK.

07:11.917 --> 07:14.083
YOU OK?

07:14.083 --> 07:15.750
YEAH. I'M GOOD.

07:15.750 --> 07:16.750
THEY'RE TRYING
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

07:16.750 --> 07:20.083
SMOOTH THINGS OVER.
I KNOW. I KNOW.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.291
YOU JUST GOTTA
LET 'EM BACK IN.

07:21.291 --> 07:22.458
SOUNDS GOOD IN THEORY,

07:22.458 --> 07:24.125
BUT IT'S HARD
TO FORGET THAT NIGHT.

07:24.125 --> 07:25.041
YOU GUYS
TOTALLY BAILED ON ME.

07:25.041 --> 07:26.291
YOU STEPPED
OVER THE LINE

07:26.291 --> 07:28.667
IN A BIG WAY THAT NIGHT, JACK.
I KNOW. I JUST...

07:28.667 --> 07:30.542
I FEEL LIKE THAT MOMENT
THAT I COULD HAVE

07:30.542 --> 07:33.917
GRACEFULLY APOLOGIZED
HAS KINDA PASSED ME BY.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.250
EVERY TIME
I'M AROUND THESE GUYS

07:35.250 --> 07:36.667
I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.458
WELL, STOP STRESSING.
YOU ARE  AN IDIOT.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.500
HMM?

07:39.500 --> 07:41.041
[LAUGHS]

07:42.667 --> 07:44.250
I KNOW YOU'RE A SNAKE
AND A CON ARTIST.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.458
I KNOW YOU'VE SLEPT YOUR WAY

07:45.458 --> 07:46.708
THROUGH THE
FEMALE STUDENT BODY

07:46.708 --> 07:48.000
AND ALMOST
HALF THE FACULTY.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.667
THE KIND OF BOY
WHO'LL BREAK YOUR HEART

07:49.667 --> 07:52.041
AND THEN START IN
ON YOUR SISTER.

07:52.041 --> 07:53.458
GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.792
IT'S OVERCAST
AND GREY.

07:55.792 --> 07:57.125
Jen: ♪ HMM HMM HMM ♪

07:57.125 --> 07:58.875
THERE, THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.583
A WEEK AGO,
I SAW IT VERY CLEARLY.

08:00.583 --> 08:02.917
NOW I LOOK AT IT,
AND ALL I SEE

08:02.917 --> 08:05.834
ARE THESE HUGE,
NIGHTMARISH OBSTACLES.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.583
IT'S LIKE,
THE MOVIE'S DISAPPEARED,

08:07.583 --> 08:09.250
JUST GOTTEN LOST
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY.
I DON'T KNOW.

08:09.250 --> 08:12.458
OR, MAYBE I HAVE.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.792
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD,
CAN IT?

08:14.792 --> 08:16.959
[LAUGHS]
NOT THAT BAD?

08:16.959 --> 08:18.667
OK, THE ENDING DOESN'T WORK,

08:18.667 --> 08:20.500
BUT WE HAVE LESS
THAN 12 HOURS TO REWRITE IT

08:20.500 --> 08:23.208
BECAUSE THE LIGHTS
THEY WERE GONNA USE

08:23.208 --> 08:24.458
FOR THAT PARTICULAR SEQUENCE

08:24.458 --> 08:26.250
WE ONLY HAVE RENTED
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.458
[LAUGHS]

08:27.458 --> 08:28.750
BUT THE REAL PUNCH LINE IS,

08:28.750 --> 08:30.166
ALL OF THIS PALES
IN COMPARISON

08:30.166 --> 08:32.082
TO THE REAL PROBLEM.

08:32.082 --> 08:32.917
OK. WHAT'S
THE REAL PROBLEM?

08:32.917 --> 08:34.750
THE REAL PROBLEM
IS THAT OLIVER

08:34.750 --> 08:36.207
IS WITHOUT A DOUBT,

08:36.207 --> 08:40.041
THE MOST PATHETIC EXCUSE
FOR A THESPIAN THAT'S EVER BEEN.

08:40.041 --> 08:43.332
[SIGHS]

08:43.332 --> 08:46.417
OW!

08:46.417 --> 08:49.792
JACK AND GRAMS HAVE
MORE SEXUAL CHEMISTRY
THAN THESE TWO.

08:49.792 --> 08:51.792
HELLO, PEOPLE.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.708
WHAT? WHAT DID I MISS?

08:56.708 --> 08:58.458
HAVE A SEAT,
SKIPPER.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.959
IT'S TIME FOR US
TO THINK ABOUT

09:09.959 --> 09:10.625
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE MOVIE.

09:10.625 --> 09:12.375
I DON'T FOLLOW.

09:12.375 --> 09:13.458
HAVING WATCHED
SOME OF THE FOOTAGE,

09:13.458 --> 09:16.917
IT'S OCCURRED TO ME...

09:16.917 --> 09:18.417
IT'S POSSIBLE YOU'RE NOT
THE RIGHT ACTOR

09:18.417 --> 09:22.166
FOR THIS PARTICULAR ROLE.

09:22.166 --> 09:23.583
HMM.

09:24.708 --> 09:27.500
WELL, I'M THINKING
YOU'RE WRONG.

09:28.875 --> 09:30.667
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

09:30.667 --> 09:32.208
YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR,

09:32.208 --> 09:33.708
AND IF THIS BEHEMOTH

09:33.708 --> 09:35.291
HAS A PRAYER
OF GETTING DONE,

09:35.291 --> 09:37.333
IT'S GONNA BE BECAUSE
THE FINAL DECISION
ON EVERYTHING,

09:37.333 --> 09:40.542
INCLUDING THE CASTING,

09:40.542 --> 09:41.625
CAME FROM YOU.

09:41.625 --> 09:44.166
REALLY?
YOU'RE OK WITH THIS?

09:44.166 --> 09:45.166
ON THE FLIPSIDE,

09:45.166 --> 09:46.458
WE HAVE TO RECAST
THE PART TODAY

09:46.458 --> 09:48.583
IF WE'RE GONNA SHOOT
THE FINALE TONIGHT.

09:48.583 --> 09:50.583
WHERE ARE WE GONNA
FIND AN ACTOR WHO
FITS THE BILL, YOU KNOW?

09:50.583 --> 09:52.625
SOMEBODY'S WHO'S...

09:52.625 --> 09:57.250
SEXY, CHARISMATIC
AND ATTRACTIVE.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.542
AND NOT BURDENED
WITH A SOUL.

09:58.542 --> 09:59.917
EXACTLY.

09:59.917 --> 10:01.208
WHERE WE GONNA FIND
A GUY LIKE THAT
IN 6 HOURS?

10:01.208 --> 10:02.333
[LAUGHS]

10:02.333 --> 10:05.500
I USED TO DATE HIM.

10:08.458 --> 10:11.125
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

10:11.125 --> 10:12.333
OH, YES IT IS.

10:12.333 --> 10:15.291
IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.500
AND YOU WOULD NEVER
MAKE ME DO THAT,

10:18.500 --> 10:20.375
WOULD YOU, DAWSON?

10:21.917 --> 10:22.708
[GROAN]

10:25.583 --> 10:27.458
[LAUGHS]

10:27.458 --> 10:28.834
JEN LINDLEY.
HOW YA BEEN?

10:31.125 --> 10:32.917
BUSY.

10:32.917 --> 10:34.750
JUST TRYING
TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND

10:34.750 --> 10:36.667
THIS WHOLE
"LEMON DIET COKE"
PHENOMENON.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.125
I KNEW IT. I KNEW YOU COULD
NEVER LIVE WITHOUT ME.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.625
HMM.

10:40.625 --> 10:42.208
OH, ON THE CONTRARY,

10:42.208 --> 10:44.000
I ACTUALLY PLAN TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

10:44.000 --> 10:46.291
LIVING WITHOUT YOU,
CHARLIE, BUT...

10:46.291 --> 10:48.542
I NEED A FAVOR.

10:48.542 --> 10:50.625
A FAVOR?

10:50.625 --> 10:54.000
NOW WHY ON EARTH
WOULD I DO YOU A FAVOR?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.458
YOU GET TO MAKE OUT
WITH A REALLY HOT GIRL.

10:56.458 --> 10:57.750
OK. STEP INTO MY OFFICE

11:08.417 --> 11:10.583
THE GUY IS UNBELIEVABLE.

11:10.583 --> 11:13.250
I KNOW. HE COULDN'T EVEN
REMEMBER HER FIRST NAME.

11:13.250 --> 11:15.542
NOT HER LAST NAME-- HER LAST
NAME I MIGHT UNDERSTAND.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.000
I'VE SLEPT WITH GUYS
WHOSE LAST NAMES

11:17.000 --> 11:18.458
HAVE ESCAPED ME THE MORNING
AFTER, BUT HER FIRST NAME?

11:18.458 --> 11:21.834
WHO?
WHAT? WAIT...

11:21.834 --> 11:22.333
WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:22.333 --> 11:23.500
WILDER.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.667
RIGHT. WILDER. UNBELIEVABLE.

11:26.667 --> 11:27.750
SO I'M STANDING THERE,

11:27.750 --> 11:29.708
READY TO SAY
EVERYTHING I NEVER SAID,

11:29.708 --> 11:30.834
AND THEN HE PULLS THIS

11:30.834 --> 11:32.375
JEDI-MIND-TRICK,
AND SUDDENLY,

11:32.375 --> 11:33.583
I CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER WHO I AM.

11:33.583 --> 11:34.667
YOU'RE JOEY POTTER.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.959
I REFUSE TO BECOME
ANOTHER ONE OF HIS GROUPIES.

11:36.959 --> 11:39.417
COMPLETELY INFATUATED, REDUCED
TO A BABBLING IDIOT

11:39.417 --> 11:40.500
AT THE MENTION
OF HIS NAME.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.000
MAY I, UM...

11:42.000 --> 11:43.166
BE BRUTALLY HONEST?

11:43.166 --> 11:45.834
LIKE YOU'VE EVER BEEN
ANYTHING BUT?

11:45.834 --> 11:47.959
YOU ARE COMPLETELY
INFATUATED WITH HIM,

11:47.959 --> 11:50.250
AND YOU HAVE BEEN REDUCED
TO A BABBLING IDIOT

11:50.250 --> 11:51.667
AT THE MERE MENTION
OF HIS NAME.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.375
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE
THAT'S A BAD THING.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.875
HOW COULD IT NOT BE
A BAD THING, AUDREY?

11:55.875 --> 11:58.375
ONCE UPON A TIME,
I HAD THIS...

11:58.375 --> 12:00.792
AMAZING MENTOR.

12:00.792 --> 12:03.083
SOMEONE WHO BELIEVED
IN ME AND RESPECTED ME

12:03.083 --> 12:04.291
AND WE WERE FRIENDS.
GOOD FRIENDS.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.083
AND WHENEVER YOU WOULD ALLUDE
TO SOME AFFAIR

12:06.083 --> 12:09.250
BETWEEN TEACHER AND STUDENT,
I WOULD JUST DISMISS IT.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.041
WELL, THE LADY DOTH
PROTEST TOO MUCH.

12:11.041 --> 12:12.250
I HAVE
TO DROP HIS CLASS.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.208
I MEAN, SHOULD I DROP
HIS CLASS? I DON'T KNOW.

12:14.208 --> 12:15.542
ARE YOU ASKING
FOR MY ADVICE,

12:15.542 --> 12:16.667
OR ARE YOU
HAVING A SOLILOQUY?

12:16.667 --> 12:17.708
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

12:17.708 --> 12:18.875
I SPEND
THE REST OF THE YEAR

12:18.875 --> 12:20.667
ANGSTING OVER SOME GUY
I CAN'T BE WITH?

12:20.667 --> 12:22.375
I'VE BEEN THERE.
IT'S EXCRUCIATING.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.458
BUNNY... BREATHE.

12:25.458 --> 12:26.583
ASK YOURSELF SOMETHING,

12:26.583 --> 12:27.750
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

12:27.750 --> 12:31.542
YOU FELT AS COMPLETELY
AND TOTALLY ALIVE

12:31.542 --> 12:33.417
AS YOU DO RIGHT NOW?

12:35.041 --> 12:37.250
[BOTH LAUGH]

12:38.166 --> 12:40.250
WHO WERE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:40.250 --> 12:42.875
[GROANS]

12:46.333 --> 12:47.708
YO.

12:47.708 --> 12:48.750
HEY. THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING

12:48.750 --> 12:50.750
WITH THE OTHER GUYS
TO THE ATHLETIC CENTER?

12:50.750 --> 12:52.083
PICK UP ON
THE GYMNASTICS TEAM?

12:52.083 --> 12:54.417
YOU KNOW, TEENAGE GIRLS
SLAMMING THEIR PELVISES

12:54.417 --> 12:56.208
INTO THE UNEVEN BARS
AT 80-MILES-AN-HOUR.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.917
I THINK THAT'D BE
RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY.

12:57.917 --> 12:59.417
NO, I HAD WORK TO DO,

12:59.417 --> 13:00.625
SO I FIGURED
I'D GET STARTED
WITH PUTTING IT OFF.

13:00.625 --> 13:02.875
[LAUGHS]
YEAH.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.500
PROCRASTINATION...

13:06.250 --> 13:08.875
IT'S THE ONLY SKILL
WE EVER LEARN IN COLLEGE.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.792
AIN'T IT A LITTLE EARLY
IN THE DAY TO START
KNOCKING 'EM BACK?

13:10.792 --> 13:13.291
ONLY IF YOU'RE
DOING IT ALONE.

13:13.291 --> 13:16.041
BESIDES, YOU AND I HAVE
SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.125
OH, DO WE?

13:17.125 --> 13:17.583
YES, WE DO.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.458
MADDEN 2002.

13:19.458 --> 13:20.875
OHHHH.

13:20.875 --> 13:22.542
YEAH, YOUR PATRIOTS
KICKED MY BEARS

13:22.542 --> 13:24.458
INTO A DIFFERENT TIME ZONE
LAST TIME THEY MET,

13:24.458 --> 13:26.208
AND I THINK WE'RE READY
FOR SOME REVENGE.

13:26.208 --> 13:27.750
GET SET
FOR SOME DISAPPOINTMENT,

13:27.750 --> 13:29.458
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA
KICK YOUR ASS MORE.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.458
[LAUGHS]
NO, NO. I DON'T THINK SO,

13:33.083 --> 13:36.458
"YOU'RE FALLING
IN LOVE WITH ME."

13:36.458 --> 13:38.792
"I CAN'T SAY YOU'RE
LACKING FOR CONFIDENCE."

13:38.792 --> 13:40.583
"THAT'S NOT TRUE."

13:40.583 --> 13:42.417
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

13:42.417 --> 13:45.625
"DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE FALLING
IN LOVE WITH ME."

13:45.625 --> 13:47.250
"NOW HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

13:47.250 --> 13:48.625
"I MEAN, HOW DO YOU KNOW
I'M NOT GONNA JUST USE YOU UP

13:48.625 --> 13:51.166
"AND THROW YOU OUT.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.125
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE ALWAYS DONE."

13:53.125 --> 13:54.166
"YOU CAN SLEEP WITH..."

13:54.166 --> 13:56.583
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH--

13:56.583 --> 13:57.583
"NOT EVEN YOU."

13:57.583 --> 14:01.166
"I DIDN'T KNOW.

14:01.166 --> 14:04.500
I'VE NEVER WANTED ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE."

14:04.500 --> 14:05.625
UH...

14:05.625 --> 14:08.250
"NEITHER HAVE I."

14:08.250 --> 14:10.166
A WORLD OF PAIN.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.667
CHARLIE,
ONE STEP CLOSER,

14:11.667 --> 14:12.667
AND YOU'RE ENTERING
A WORLD OF PAIN.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.166
YOU KNOW, DAWSON, BUDDY,

14:15.166 --> 14:17.166
IT'S DIFFICULT TO REALLY
BECOME THE CHARACTER

14:17.166 --> 14:19.208
WHEN SHE IS NOT GIVING ME
ANYTHING TO WORK WITH.

14:19.208 --> 14:22.333
ACTING TIP: IT'S CALLED
USING YOUR IMAGINATION.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.333
OK. YOU KNOW,
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

14:24.333 --> 14:25.500
SO, AH, JEN...

14:25.500 --> 14:27.333
THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.834
UM, CHARLIE,
WOULD YOU MIND JUST...

14:31.834 --> 14:33.333
STEPPING IN THE OTHER
ROOM FOR A SECOND.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.792
YEAH.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.375
SO IS THIS GONNA BE
AWKWARD FOR YOU,

14:39.375 --> 14:41.208
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S EX
STARRING IN OUR FLICK?

14:41.208 --> 14:43.750
I'M RUNNING OUT
OF OPTIONS HERE.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.792
I GOTTA SAY...

14:44.792 --> 14:47.041
HE'S PRETTY DECENT.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.667
I MEAN...

14:48.667 --> 14:50.542
IF YOU'RE GOING
FOR THE BRUTALLY HANDSOME,

14:50.542 --> 14:52.208
RIPPLING ABS,
TONY SCOTT-VERSION OF ME,

14:52.208 --> 14:53.875
HE'S AS GOOD
AS WE'RE GONNA GET, RIGHT?

14:53.875 --> 14:55.041
RIGHT.
YEAH.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.000
OK, SO WE USE HIM.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.333
YES.
PROBLEM SOLVED.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.166
NOW ALL I HAVE
TO DO IS OVERHAUL
THE ENDING

14:59.166 --> 15:00.500
AND WE MIGHT
GET THIS DONE.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.834
[LAUGHS]
HEAVENS TO BETSY.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.000
FIRST, YOU TAKE AWAY
MY STARRING ROLE,

15:04.000 --> 15:04.875
AND NOW YOU WANT
TO REWRITE MY ENDING?

15:04.875 --> 15:06.083
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

15:06.083 --> 15:08.583
ACTUALLY,
IT'S FRIGGIN' BRILLIANT.

15:08.583 --> 15:11.166
FIRST, SHE BREAKS UP WITH HIM,
BREAKS HIS HEART,

15:11.166 --> 15:13.291
THEN HE BLOW HER AWAY
WITH A .22.

15:13.291 --> 15:14.625
POETIC JUSTICE.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.834
I USED TO THINK IT WAS GREAT.
IT WAS PERFECT. BUT...

15:16.834 --> 15:20.125
HAVING SEEN THE FOOTAGE--
YADA, YADA, YADA.

15:20.125 --> 15:21.166
SO...

15:21.166 --> 15:23.083
DID I GET THE PART, OR WHAT?

15:23.083 --> 15:24.208
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.875
CAN YOU LEARN YOUR LINES
IN 3 HOURS?

15:25.875 --> 15:27.583
UH, BETTER MAKE THAT 2.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.208
HMM.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.583
ALL RIGHT.

15:31.583 --> 15:34.125
Eric: ALL MY DUDES,
THEY GO TO THESE PARTIES
EVERY NIGHT

15:34.125 --> 15:36.792
LOOKING FOR THEIR
NEXT GIRLFRIEND.
AND FOR WHAT?

15:36.792 --> 15:38.208
HUH? SO THEY
CAN HAVE SOME CHICK

15:38.208 --> 15:39.792
WHO'S GONNA BITCH AT 'EM
IN THE MORNING?

15:39.792 --> 15:41.750
MAKE THEM
WATCH NOTTING HILL
OVER AND OVER?

15:41.750 --> 15:42.583
NO. FORGET THAT.
THEY CAN KEEP THEIR KEG.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.875
[BOTH LAUGH]

15:44.875 --> 15:46.250
I LIKED NOTTING HILL.

15:46.250 --> 15:49.000
[BOTH LAUGH]

15:57.208 --> 16:00.041
DUDE.
YEAH?

16:02.291 --> 16:04.208
WHAT WAS IT LIKE
WHEN YOU REALIZED
YOU WERE GAY?

16:07.542 --> 16:09.125
WELL, IT WASN'T
LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

16:09.125 --> 16:12.375
IT WASN'T LIKE
I WOKE UP ONE MORNING

16:12.375 --> 16:14.125
FROM A ESPECIALLY NASTY DREAM
ABOUT ROBERT DOWNEY JR.

16:14.125 --> 16:17.750
AND I SAID TO MYSELF,
"HEY, I MUST BE GAY."

16:19.458 --> 16:21.166
WELL,
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

16:21.166 --> 16:23.125
[SIGHS]

16:23.125 --> 16:23.750
WELL, YOU KNOW...

16:23.750 --> 16:26.500
SO MANY PEOPLE JUST...

16:26.500 --> 16:28.041
THEY SPEND SO MUCH
OF THEIR LIVES

16:28.041 --> 16:31.166
JUST LOCKED UP IN THIS CAGE
INSIDE THEMSELVES.

16:32.792 --> 16:33.625
AND THEY NEVER EVEN KNOW

16:33.625 --> 16:35.792
THAT THEY HAVE
THE KEY ALL ALONG.

16:37.875 --> 16:40.375
THAT'S HOW IT WAS FOR ME.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.708
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHEN
I FIRST REALIZED IT, YOU KNOW.

16:42.708 --> 16:44.417
I DON'T KNOW. AT SOME LEVEL,

16:44.417 --> 16:46.208
I THINK I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN IT.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.291
PROBABLY JUST LIKE

16:47.291 --> 16:49.291
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
YOU'RE STRAIGHT.

16:49.291 --> 16:52.291
IT WASN'T ABOUT
REALIZING THAT I WAS GAY,

16:52.291 --> 16:56.041
IT WAS ABOUT REALIZING
THAT IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

16:58.166 --> 17:00.500
YOU'RE AN
AMAZING GUY, JACK.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.667
YOU KNOW THAT?
YOU REALLY ARE.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.583
[SIGHS]

17:17.333 --> 17:21.834
YOU'RE THE KIND OF GUY
THAT I WANNA BE.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.542
UM...

17:34.542 --> 17:36.291
DO YOU, UH...

17:36.291 --> 17:36.875
DO YOU WANNA
WATCH SOME MORE TV?

17:36.875 --> 17:38.542
I, UH...I-I-I THINK

17:38.542 --> 17:41.542
THE WORLD'S MOST HORRIFYING
BUNGEE-ACCIDENTS  IS ON.

17:41.542 --> 17:44.250
UM...

17:44.250 --> 17:46.834
NO, I HAVE WORK TO DO.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.083
COME ON, MAN.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA--

17:48.083 --> 17:49.375
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DO IT NOW.

17:49.375 --> 17:50.834
YEAH. I HAVE TO. OK?

17:50.834 --> 17:51.542
I'M--I'M--I'M GONNA GO.

17:51.542 --> 17:55.250
OK?

17:55.250 --> 17:57.708
YEAH, I'LL SEE YA.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
HEY.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.834
YOU SELLING
GIRL SCOUT COOKIES?

18:20.834 --> 18:22.333
DO YOU HAVE ANY
OF THE COCONUT ONES

18:22.333 --> 18:25.417
WITH THE CHOCOLATE
AND THE CARAMEL?
I LOVE THOSE.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.250
ACTUALLY, I FIGURED OUT
WHAT I WANT TO SAY.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.333
EXCELLENT.
I'LL ALERT THE MEDIA.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.083
DO YOU THINK
IT'D BE POSSIBLE

18:34.083 --> 18:36.000
TO LOSE THE OBNOXIOUS GLIB
FOR 5 SECONDS?

18:36.000 --> 18:39.959
YES. YES, OF COURSE.
IT IS POSSIBLE. SURE.

18:39.959 --> 18:41.166
I'M SORRY. GO AHEAD.

18:41.166 --> 18:42.125
UH...

18:42.125 --> 18:43.959
I WANT TO SAY...

30:17.625 --> 30:18.959
ISN'T IT
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

30:18.959 --> 30:20.125
THAT HE IS
THE ANTICHRIST,

A BIG FAVOR.

INSIST YOU COME ALONG
ON THIS MISSION?

BETWEEN YOU AND AUDREY?

30:46.708 --> 30:48.834
NO. NO.
OF COURSE NOT.

30:48.834 --> 30:50.542
BECAUSE IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED BETWEEN US

30:50.542 --> 30:51.750
IT WOULD BE
A HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE

YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

30:55.208 --> 30:57.166
OK. IF ONE MORE PERSON
CALLS ME AN IDIOT,

DESERVE TO BE

31:34.041 --> 31:35.750
IN THE SAME
LAVATORY AS YOU.

WHY, BECAUSE
YOU KISSED PACEY?

THE SPECIAL-EST THING

31:56.500 --> 31:57.875

I CAME HERE.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.792
AND WHAT DO I DO?
I STEP ON IT.

31:59.792 --> 32:01.875

BECAUSE I AM WEAK
WHEN IT COMES TO MEN.

32:01.875 --> 32:03.625

OK...

32:04.750 --> 32:06.875
MAYBE YOU ARE WEAK.

32:06.875 --> 32:08.458

IS NOT WEAK.

THE SMARTEST THING
