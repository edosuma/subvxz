WEBVTT

00:48.720 --> 00:50.360
Here you are.

03:13.600 --> 03:17.440
So you see the plan is bulletproof.
We can start as soon as we...

03:18.760 --> 03:20.800
Sorry I'm late.
-No problem.

03:21.080 --> 03:25.560
I'll just finish...
it's clear from what I've said

03:25.680 --> 03:30.040
its a no-brainer for both of us
that you should extend the loan.

03:30.240 --> 03:33.320
Like we all know
the future is really bright

03:33.400 --> 03:35.000
in Icelandic
telecommunications.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.880
Yes, we all agree,
the future is bright.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.800
Right...

03:41.880 --> 03:44.280
Kristin, what do you think?
-Yes...

03:45.120 --> 03:46.800
What has changed?

03:48.440 --> 03:51.800
What? -Two months ago
the bank rejected your application

03:51.880 --> 03:55.240
for extension because your business
plan was unconvincing.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.960
So, I'm just wondering...
what changed?

03:59.760 --> 04:03.520
Yes, that's a good question, Kristin.
Everything has changed.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.800
It's a total rethink.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.000
As I explained
just before you arrived.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.320
I've compared the old plan
with the new one.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.079
If we...
-The new plan...

04:17.160 --> 04:20.519
Wait a minute.
If we look at paragraph four...

04:20.600 --> 04:24.160
which contains the main arguments
for the new plan.

04:24.240 --> 04:27.880
And compare it to paragraph five
from the old plan...

04:28.200 --> 04:30.560
You can see that only the
wording has changed.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.000
It's normal that there is a bit
of an overlap.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.120
Let's look at the loans.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.720
You can see clearly
they are the same numbers,

04:40.960 --> 04:42.680
same result...

04:42.760 --> 04:46.600
Like we say, Runolfur...
It's old wine in new bottles.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.320
Hi, sorry.
I forgot to call you back.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
Can you hear me?

05:05.480 --> 05:06.640
Yes.
Where are you?

05:06.760 --> 05:09.680
I forgot to tell you that I went on
a small research trip this morning.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.240
Research?

05:11.360 --> 05:14.720
Has it something to do
with Lisa Droéfn? -Lisa Drofn?

05:15.040 --> 05:16.280
No...

05:16.720 --> 05:18.280
We broke up last week.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.320
Oh?

05:19.840 --> 05:21.000
What happened?

05:21.080 --> 05:24.480
She's a duvet thief.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.200
She always stole my duvet.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.720
I can't believe you dumped her
because of that.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.520
I remember that you dumped a guy
because he laughed like a walrus.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.800
That was totally different.
-Right.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.440
I'll be back in two, three days.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.400
Where are you?
-Me?

05:46.720 --> 05:49.880
I'm just outside the capital.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.760
You're on Vatnajokull-glacier.
You didn't invite me.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.200
You wouldn't have been able
to make it anyway.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.800
No, I mean...
-Always working, right?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.480
Yes, it's a busy period right now.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.800
It's always a busy period.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.520
What are you talking about?
-Avalanche!

06:05.600 --> 06:08.600
Grab Benni.
Hold him.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.880
Elli!

06:42.240 --> 06:44.160
What's going on?
Are you OK?

06:44.240 --> 06:46.240
Yes, I'm fine.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.240
What happened?
-I don't know.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.840
I hit a stone or something.
-What?

07:02.560 --> 07:04.760
Are you OK?
-Yes.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.480
What?
-What's this?

07:08.880 --> 07:10.080
Wheel?

07:11.200 --> 07:14.040
Is it from a plane?

07:14.120 --> 07:16.040
I think so.
-Check this out.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.000
Kids.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.200
What?

07:34.240 --> 07:35.840
Are you kidding me?

07:42.280 --> 07:44.000
This is crazy.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.720
Hi. -Hi.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.920
I wanted to talk to you.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.920
Yes.
But the case is closed.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.520
We must be able to
find a middle ground.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.200
You have to discuss that with Rosa.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.880
I can't be bothered to talk to Rosa.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.600
She only listens to you.
Which I understand.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.400
See you later, Rundlfur.
-Kristin.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.480
Why don't you come
and work for me?

08:19.480 --> 08:21.360
Really?
-A good one.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.200
Kristin.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.240
Ready?
-Yes.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.720
A historic moment.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.360
Be careful.
-Yes.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.760
Can I come too?

09:00.560 --> 09:03.320
Wait.
-Can you see anything?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.040
Is there something there?

09:23.120 --> 09:25.480
Are you OK?
-Yes.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.560
This is sick.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.280
Benni.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.240
Is it going to land here?

10:10.320 --> 10:11.880
What?

10:12.400 --> 10:14.400
An American pilot?

10:17.120 --> 10:19.160
Elli, come back.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.720
Hi.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.640
My boy, how are you?

10:39.720 --> 10:42.680
Been relaxing all day
like always?

10:44.320 --> 10:45.760
Aren't you hungry?

10:53.680 --> 10:55.920
You're so spoiled.

10:57.840 --> 11:01.080
Two giant planes from the U. S. Army
landed at Keflavik airport last night

11:01.160 --> 11:03.760
with scientists from the Alaska
Ecological Institute.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.040
Their mission is to test
new technology

11:06.120 --> 11:08.840
to measure the effect
of global warming on glaciers.

11:08.920 --> 11:12.240
Not everybody is happy
with the mission.

11:12.320 --> 11:16.880
We think it's strange that Americans
are importing huge machines

11:16.960 --> 11:19.320
to investigate global warming which

11:19.400 --> 11:22.360
they themselves are
responsible for

11:22.440 --> 11:24.760
and we've decided to protest
at the U. S. Embassy...

13:32.120 --> 13:35.000
OK, you broke a fingernail
and want me to rescue you?

13:35.080 --> 13:39.000
They killed Benni.
I got away but left Vally behind...

13:39.360 --> 13:41.400
Elli, really.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.600
Elli?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.120
This is Elias.
Don't leave a message.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.680
Save it on a floppy
and send it through the mail.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.720
Hello, Elias.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.800
I wanted to let you know
you're a fucking idiot. OK?

16:09.760 --> 16:12.000
This is Elias.
Don't leave a message...

16:28.000 --> 16:29.520
Hi. -Hi.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.200
Weren't you talking about
old wine in new bottles?

16:33.520 --> 16:36.520
I kKnow.
I'm rude.

16:37.920 --> 16:41.760
Real music.
-This is not ok.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.880
OK, if you really think this
will change anything...

16:45.960 --> 16:47.840
Where is the corkscrew?

16:51.640 --> 16:54.360
Glasses... here.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.079
Damn.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.200
Yes, I know.
My fault.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.400
I'll buy you new glasses.
-No problem. Wait.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.960
Hello.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.880
Hello.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.040
Hey!

19:58.000 --> 19:59.680
Can I help you?

20:00.360 --> 20:03.160
Excuse me?
You can't...

22:47.320 --> 22:50.640
It's finished.
I'll get a new one.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.960
You look wretched.
Come in.

23:27.520 --> 23:31.040
My dear.
Oh my God. Sit down.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.000
You must be... here take this.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.120
Aren't you freezing cold?

23:43.560 --> 23:45.440
What happened?

23:47.480 --> 23:49.320
I don't know.

23:51.120 --> 23:55.480
I don't want to get you in
trouble, Résa. -Trouble?

23:55.560 --> 23:57.400
I was just going to...
-No, no.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.560
You're not getting me in trouble.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.960
You don't understand.

24:03.440 --> 24:04.440
Elli sent this to me.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.120
I think they found
an old plane on the glacier.

24:09.840 --> 24:15.040
It's an old Nazi plane.
There are corpses in it.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.520
Rosa.
Locked?

24:17.600 --> 24:18.880
I'm not here!

24:19.280 --> 24:21.680
I'm going to put the lamb
on the grill.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.440
Yes, honey.

24:23.640 --> 24:26.480
I'll be out soon.
-Great.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.280
Kristin.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.760
My dear.
-Look.

24:31.840 --> 24:34.080
You have to tell me the truth.
Let me take a look.

24:34.160 --> 24:37.960
Did you take something?
-No. Look.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.440
It's Operation... is this an I?

24:42.720 --> 24:44.160
Leon.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.960
Operation Leon.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.600
I have to know what it means.
What does it mean?

24:50.320 --> 24:52.240
Operation...

24:52.360 --> 24:54.080
Yes. -...Leon.

24:56.720 --> 25:00.040
OK, try "Nazis",

25:00.320 --> 25:03.320
"airplane”, "Iceland"...

25:03.400 --> 25:05.320
"Vatnajokull."

25:07.280 --> 25:10.360
OK.
Is this something?

25:10.960 --> 25:12.600
Try this one.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.160
One of the people who specialize
in studying the occupation

25:16.240 --> 25:20.400
and Nazis in Iceland is the
new professor

25:20.480 --> 25:23.160
at the University of Iceland,
the Brit Steve Rush.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.640
You're kidding.
-What?

25:27.760 --> 25:31.000
You know him?
-Yes.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.000
Is that...
-Wait a minute.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.040
Roésa!

25:46.960 --> 25:48.320
Look!
Come here.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.600
I'll be right back.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.520
The police in Reykjavik is
looking for Kristin JOhannesdottir.

25:59.600 --> 26:03.000
She's 34 years old,
of average height,

26:03.080 --> 26:05.520
dark hair to her shoulders
and brown eyes.

26:05.600 --> 26:11.280
If someone has seen Kristin
they should contact the police.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.360
Are you looking for Steve?

26:34.880 --> 26:36.720
Yes.
-He's not home.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.160
Do you know where he is?

26:40.280 --> 26:44.120
He's probably at the Irish Bar.
As usual.

29:48.360 --> 29:50.040
Boys.
Help me.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.760
This guy is stalking me.
-What?

29:52.840 --> 29:53.800
Yes, he's a rapist.
-This one?

29:53.880 --> 29:54.840
Yes.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.840
Hot dog with all the fixings?

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.480
Hello.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.600
It's safer to go there by sea.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.360
Yes, thanks but we'll take
care of this ourselves.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.840
The forecast is fine.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.600
We can get there by noon.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.280
Just because you're
helping us now...

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.680
Do you think that fixes anything?

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.320
What?
-No, Kristin.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.320
I don't think it does.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.680
Here's more Parkodin Forte.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.320
Thank you.
Always so considerate.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.800
Elli talked to me.
-Yes, I know. He told me.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.160
I told him not to spend
any energy on you.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.240
Can't you go to the police?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.240
No.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.040
Well, you'll be fine with Indiana
Jones there in your corner.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.000
I'm going to check on him.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.400
Do you want new bandages?
-No, I'm fine.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:41.400
If you hear from Elias...
Please let me know?

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.720
I'll do that.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.080
What's this bloody noise?

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.600
Good morning.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.320
Morning.
-Are you Einar Ragnarsson?

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.360
Yes.

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.840
Hello.
My name is Kristin.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.920
Sarah, Leo Stiller's wife
sent us here.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.720
What's wrong with you?

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.840
I've got a wound.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.960
It's bleeding through.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.680
We can't have that.
Let's take a look at it.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.240
It's almost finished.

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.480
Here we are.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.120
OK? -Yes.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.080
Great.
-Thank you.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:07.920
Einar, I know you know what Sarah
and Leo were doing on the glacier.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.840
They were looking for that plane,
weren't they?

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.200
You have to help us.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.240
The square thing is the goal!

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.960
Fuck me, man.
I could have scored there.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.240
Well.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.600
Pancakes?

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.920
What are you thinking?

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:17.040
There's a cave there.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.360
<i>My dad and his brother played there
when they were kids.</i>

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.800
Then that part started melting
and it was filled with water

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.680
and the cave disappeared.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:28.040
The glacier is always changing.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.400
The water comes and goes.

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.880
The cave where your dad played.

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.200
Can you show me
exactly where it is?

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.640
Yes.
I'll get the GPS.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.320
Fits perfectly.
Try it.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.960
Yes?

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:02.480
This is the edge of the mountain.
It's not complicated.

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.960
You just go down there
and then up.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.480
You'll notice it right away.
-OK.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:09.400
I put flares in your backpack
just to be safe.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:12.200
Thank you very much, Einar.
-Yes.

01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:24.240
Come on.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:33.960
Listen to me.

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.440
OK.

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.480
You've got a compass here.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:41.360
Drive due south the whole time.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:44.560
Yes, listen to me.
There's a guy there called Einar.

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.400
Call the police when you get there.
-They're going to kill you.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.920
Elli.
Come on.

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:55.800
OK.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.960
You have to hurry.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.240
Go!

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.560
The families of the two rescue
squad members

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.960
who died on Vatnajékull-glacier
last month

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:22.320
demand an investigation of the events
that resulted in at least six dead

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:26.240
after a large operation by
American scientists on the glacier.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.040
The government has confirmed that the
scientists did not have a permission

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:34.160
to do studies on the glacier.

01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:36.600
The prime minister
hasn't commented

01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:39.080
but his ministry's press adviser

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:42.280
sent a short statement
to the press stating

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.200
there was a good relationship
between the US and Iceland

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:50.320
and that it was not in danger.

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:25.680
Really.

01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:28.960
Did you see anything?

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:30.760
No.

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:34.440
This is yours.
-My boy.

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.280
Did you miss mom?

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:40.200
How is Steve?
-Like always.

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.760
Nuts.

01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.760
Thank you for getting me a hamburger.
-No problem.
