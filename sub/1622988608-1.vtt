I missed a turnoff.

01:50.018 --> 01:53.445
Hey, look, dog bakery.

01:53.522 --> 01:55.614
Now where did a dog learn
how to bake?

01:55.765 --> 01:58.450
It's a bakery for dogs, mom.
Not a dog who bakes.

01:58.527 --> 02:03.455
[chuckles] okay.
Uh, now, where are we?

02:04.366 --> 02:06.366
Hey. You ladies lost?

02:06.518 --> 02:09.795
Oh, uh, yes.
How could you tell?

02:09.872 --> 02:11.705
I'm looking
for springhurst street,

02:11.857 --> 02:13.690
But my navigation
seems to be failing me.

02:13.709 --> 02:16.802
Yeah, small-town life.
They're slow to update the maps.

02:16.879 --> 02:18.862
Willow actually turns
into springhurst,

02:18.881 --> 02:20.955
So if you take a left up there,
you're set.

02:20.975 --> 02:23.475
Thank you. You're a lifesaver.

02:23.552 --> 02:26.127
New arrivals, huh?
I'm glad to be of service.

02:26.147 --> 02:29.723

-Uh, I'm nikki, this is brooke.

02:29.875 --> 02:34.135
Well, welcome to town. I look
forward to seeing you around.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.821
Oh, and if by morning

02:35.972 --> 02:38.323
You haven't located
your coffee maker,

02:38.400 --> 02:40.492
Come by and enjoy a cup
on the house.

02:40.644 --> 02:43.829
Oh. Thank you, gavin.

02:43.906 --> 02:45.164

-It's fine, I guess.

Oh, things are gonna be
different here.

03:09.581 --> 03:12.082
-But no matter what...
-We're going to be together.

03:12.100 --> 03:15.986
Exactly. I think
we're gonna like it here.

[knocking on door]

03:43.373 --> 03:45.282
Hey, sweetheart, I thought

03:45.284 --> 03:47.559
You might like this
for your room.

03:48.804 --> 03:50.954
Oh, did you give dad
our new address?

03:50.973 --> 03:52.564
He promised to come visit soon.

03:52.641 --> 03:55.400
Well, that would be great,
but don't get your hopes up.

03:55.552 --> 03:58.904
"soon" means something a little
different to your dad, remember?

04:02.910 --> 04:07.228
Hey, tell you what, why don't
we go downtown in the morning,

04:07.248 --> 04:09.806
Do a little shopping
for the house, you know,

04:09.825 --> 04:12.567
Get a cupcake from that dog
who bakes? What do you say?

04:12.586 --> 04:16.088
-You're such a nerd, mom.
-I'm taking that as a yes.

04:25.173 --> 04:28.267
Mom, look! You should try it on.

04:28.343 --> 04:31.270
A new dress is definitely
not part of the shopping list.

04:31.421 --> 04:32.688
Come on.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.107
Okay.

04:39.187 --> 04:40.404
[door opens]

04:49.531 --> 04:51.623
Mom, you have to try this on,
and this.

04:51.700 --> 04:55.035
Honey, I can't try on
the whole store.

04:55.187 --> 04:58.112
Who says?
Try before you buy is my motto.

04:58.132 --> 05:01.041
[sighs] I just don't wanna
get on anyone's bad side.

05:01.193 --> 05:03.468
You know how the owners
of these stores are.

05:03.620 --> 05:04.786
No, tell me.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.880
Uh, "you break it,
you bought it."

05:07.032 --> 05:08.974

in a dressing room at a time."

05:09.051 --> 05:12.894
"unattended children will be
given an espresso and a puppy."

05:14.706 --> 05:16.130
You're the owner of the store,
aren't you?

05:16.150 --> 05:19.467
Liz cole. Welcome to
not your mamma's closet.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.320
I'm so sorry.

05:21.471 --> 05:23.880
I-I should get going.

05:23.899 --> 05:25.715
[brooke] but you haven't tried
anything on yet.

05:25.734 --> 05:27.993
We like the outfit
in the window.

05:29.071 --> 05:30.554
It's very gwyneth.

05:30.572 --> 05:32.956
Oh. Oh, I'm obsessed with goop.

05:34.893 --> 05:36.293

05:39.840 --> 05:42.799
Oh, yes.
This makes your eyes pop.

05:45.754 --> 05:47.495
I'll just be a minute, brooke.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.590
Don't worry. I'll just get her
an espresso and a puppy.

05:50.742 --> 05:52.425
Again, I'm-I'm really sorry.

05:52.578 --> 05:56.188
[sighs] don't be. I live
for a little unfiltered honesty.

06:05.607 --> 06:08.349
So where do you go to school?

06:08.369 --> 06:11.018
Oh, I don't yet.
We just moved here.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.430
And you came straight to see me?

06:13.432 --> 06:14.664
[both chuckling]

06:19.788 --> 06:20.862
What do you think?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.790
Well, I'm biased,

06:23.942 --> 06:25.275
But I think you look great.

06:25.293 --> 06:26.885
It looks nice, mom.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.471
I'll take it.

06:32.134 --> 06:34.709
So, brooke tells me
you're new in town.

06:34.728 --> 06:39.731
Yes. Uh, this can be
my job interview outfit.

06:39.808 --> 06:41.400
Oh. Where are you interviewing?

06:41.476 --> 06:43.985
Uh, so far nowhere.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.657
That'll be 87.52.

06:51.303 --> 06:53.303
Um...

06:53.321 --> 06:54.638
Oh, wait.

06:54.656 --> 06:57.474
I forgot
the new customer discount.

06:57.492 --> 07:00.234
Seventy-five, even.

07:00.254 --> 07:03.329
-You don't have to do that.
-Of course I do.

07:03.482 --> 07:06.258
-There is a catch, though.
-What's that?

07:08.244 --> 07:10.170
Take a job application.

07:10.322 --> 07:12.246
I've been looking for some help
around here.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.599
I don't have
any retail experience.

07:14.676 --> 07:17.994
Neither did I
before I opened up this shop.

07:18.013 --> 07:20.664
So come by Monday morning
before the shop opens up

07:20.682 --> 07:23.683
And we can do an interview.

07:23.835 --> 07:27.337
I mean,
this is very kind of you.

07:27.355 --> 07:29.856
But why are you doing this?

07:30.008 --> 07:33.118
Nikki, I know what it's like
to need to catch a break.

07:34.513 --> 07:35.871
See you on Monday.

07:41.870 --> 07:44.129
[nikki] brooke, you gettin'
ready for bed yet?

07:44.206 --> 07:45.855

08:57.279 --> 08:59.763
Thank you again,
for the opportunity.

08:59.781 --> 09:02.599
Like I said,
I don't have retail experience,

09:02.617 --> 09:06.953
But I have done a little
bookkeeping and I love fashion.

09:07.105 --> 09:08.880
Good enough for me.
Can you start today?

09:08.957 --> 09:12.199
Really? I, I got the job
just like that?

09:12.219 --> 09:13.793
I've a good feeling about you.

09:13.945 --> 09:15.628
All right, let's dive in.

09:15.781 --> 09:17.889
I've got a list of things
to get through.

09:17.966 --> 09:20.725
First,
our sexual harassment policy.

09:21.970 --> 09:23.228
Don't sexually harass anyone.

09:23.305 --> 09:25.230
-That's it?
-Do you need more?

09:25.307 --> 09:26.639
No.

09:26.792 --> 09:29.401
Great.
Store opens in 40 minutes.

09:29.477 --> 09:32.571
I think we've earned ourselves
a coffee break, don't you?

09:32.722 --> 09:34.239
-Oh.
-Let's go.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.893
Yeah, we're a pretty tight-knit
community downtown.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.638
I have wine club every week
with chrissie

09:41.656 --> 09:45.083
From motley's gifts and antiques
and katy from waldring books.

09:45.234 --> 09:47.586
Oh, I have to take you
by voxley's later

09:47.662 --> 09:50.647
So you can meet mary.
She's a blast.

09:50.665 --> 09:52.573
Hey, what about this place?

09:52.593 --> 09:56.761
Oh, yeah, um, I usually go to
mcbeanerstein up the street...

09:56.838 --> 09:58.079
Ladies!

09:58.098 --> 10:01.916
Liz, I, uh,
it's great to see you.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.020
Hey, look, it's cold.
Let me get you a table inside.

10:06.681 --> 10:08.356
Or this is fine, too.

10:12.187 --> 10:13.519
[nikki] this place
is really nice.

10:13.672 --> 10:14.929
[liz] I haven't been in here
in a while.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.740
[nikki] oh, love those lights.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.785
Liz, it's been a while.

10:20.862 --> 10:22.695
Has it?

10:22.848 --> 10:24.456
Hi, we actually--

10:24.607 --> 10:26.015
Yes. Of course. Nikki.

10:26.034 --> 10:27.700
Um, how are you and brooke
settling in?

10:27.853 --> 10:32.130
-Great. Everyone is welcoming.
-And how do you know our liz?

10:32.281 --> 10:35.024
Oh, we used to farm
in rural colorado together.

10:35.043 --> 10:37.802
[laughs] uh, liz just hired me.

10:37.954 --> 10:39.137
It's my first day.

10:39.288 --> 10:41.806
-First hour, actually.
-Well, congratulations.

10:41.958 --> 10:44.142
-Liz is the best.
-I couldn't agree more.

10:44.293 --> 10:47.036
-Coffee with cream, please.
-And for yourself?

10:47.055 --> 10:51.374
Oh, mm, mm,
latte with almond milk.

10:51.393 --> 10:53.559
Excellent. I just milked
the almond this morning.

10:53.712 --> 10:54.944
[nikki laughs]

10:57.232 --> 10:58.823
He's cute.

10:58.975 --> 11:01.642
Mm, good kisser, too.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.645
Oh. So are you two a--

11:04.665 --> 11:06.647
A walking relationship disaster?

11:06.667 --> 11:08.833
No. But we used to be.

11:08.985 --> 11:10.168
Sorry, I didn't know.

11:10.319 --> 11:12.061
You were gonna find out
sooner or later.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.672
Probably
not in a super awkward meeting

11:13.823 --> 11:15.156
With your boss
on your first day.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.917
-And now my last.
-But..

11:18.069 --> 11:22.071
Oh, no, you're not getting off
that easy.

11:22.090 --> 11:24.933
Come on, let's get started
on your paperwork.

11:27.762 --> 11:29.521
Milk and coffee with cream.

11:30.916 --> 11:31.856
[clicks tongue]

11:34.769 --> 11:37.344
I mean, after the divorce
it was just anna and me.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.613
Anna?

11:42.610 --> 11:44.610
That's my daughter.
She's turned 15.

11:44.763 --> 11:48.039
Oh, she's beautiful.
She looks just like you.

11:48.116 --> 11:50.524
Ugh. Acts like me, too.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.952
-She's a total pain in the butt.
-[chuckles]

11:53.104 --> 11:55.046
But I adore her.

11:55.123 --> 11:59.459
Dan, my ex, and I
had an endless custody battle.

11:59.611 --> 12:01.461
I was a mess.

12:01.613 --> 12:04.205
I had no money,
no one to talk to,

12:04.224 --> 12:07.392
And it took me a long time
to pull my life together.

12:07.543 --> 12:09.728
I always said that
if I was ever in a position

12:09.879 --> 12:14.474
To help a woman who was
in my situation, I would.

12:14.626 --> 12:17.068
And you knew
that I was in that situation

12:17.220 --> 12:19.738
Just by looking at me?

12:19.889 --> 12:23.316
Because I was looking at myself.

12:23.468 --> 12:25.577
Can I interest you ladies
in anything else?

12:25.728 --> 12:28.972
Refill, a delicious muffin
to go, fresh out of the oven?

12:28.990 --> 12:31.499
Oh. Just the check.

12:33.328 --> 12:35.569
-Oh! I'm so sorry.
-Oh!

12:35.589 --> 12:37.313
-[gavin] oh.
-Okay, let me...

12:37.332 --> 12:39.573
[liz] you know... Thanks.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.909
[nikki] oh. Uh, you know what?

12:41.928 --> 12:44.337
-Oh, I'm...
-Here.

12:44.489 --> 12:45.989
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
Please, please.

12:46.007 --> 12:48.415
-It's on the house.
-Actually, it's on my pants.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.601
Send me the dry-cleaning bill.

12:49.752 --> 12:52.328
Oh. Don't, don't worry about it.

12:52.330 --> 12:54.755
-Ready?
-Yeah, you just...

12:54.775 --> 12:58.109
-You have my keys.
-Right. Just...

13:00.113 --> 13:02.781
-[chuckles]
-[gavin] those are yours.

13:02.857 --> 13:04.765
-Thank you.
-Please come back.

13:04.785 --> 13:08.620
Um, I promise not to spill
coffee all over you again.

13:08.696 --> 13:10.121
Hopefully.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.958
Come on. Time to open the store.

13:17.355 --> 13:21.691
And then I press
the tax-exempt button? It...

13:21.709 --> 13:23.450
No, wait. Uh, yes.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.638
-[beeps]
-ha! I did it!

13:26.789 --> 13:28.640
Not bad for a first day.

13:28.791 --> 13:30.791
-You're a natural at this.
-Thank you.

13:30.811 --> 13:35.872
Uh, I would like you and anna
to come over for dinner tonight.

13:35.890 --> 13:37.816
-You don't have to do that.
-No, I want to.

13:37.892 --> 13:40.652
And I think brooke
would love to see you, too.

13:40.728 --> 13:42.545
Only if it's not
too much trouble.

13:42.564 --> 13:44.823
Of course not. 6:30?

13:44.899 --> 13:47.075
I'll bring the wine.

13:51.406 --> 13:54.407
Dan. What are you doing here?

13:54.559 --> 13:57.585
Anna left her laptop
at my place.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.065
[clears throat]
look, while I'm here, can we

14:02.083 --> 14:04.491
Change our weekends next month?

14:04.511 --> 14:07.178
No. We've already
been through this.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.305
[exhales sharply]

14:11.167 --> 14:13.242
This is my place of business.

14:13.244 --> 14:15.836
Please don't put me on the spot.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.339
You never change, do you?

14:18.358 --> 14:20.766
You're a roadblock
just to be a roadblock.

14:20.919 --> 14:23.820
All right, we're done talking.
Get out of my store.

14:30.019 --> 14:31.870
It's not the end
of this conversation, liz.

14:32.021 --> 14:34.205
That's why we have lawyers, dan.

14:38.194 --> 14:41.695
Hey, nikki.
Oh, uh, sorry to drop in.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.606
Hey! Uh, you're looking for liz?

14:43.625 --> 14:46.384
Sh-she might,
she might need a few minutes.

14:46.461 --> 14:49.112
Yeah. Uh, she and dan
still at odds?

14:49.130 --> 14:51.890
-Yeah, maybe.
-Actually, I'm looking for you.

14:51.966 --> 14:54.559
Um, I found this
after you left.

14:54.636 --> 14:56.786
Oh, I've been looking for this.

14:56.804 --> 15:00.047
-It just keeps slipping off.
-It's, uh, celtic, right?

15:00.066 --> 15:02.959
That's right. Graduation gift
from my grandmother.

15:02.977 --> 15:05.570
-Oh, well, it's very beautiful.
-Hm.

15:05.721 --> 15:08.314
-Have you been to ireland?
-No. Always wanted to.

15:08.466 --> 15:10.149
My grandmother and I
even planned a trip,

15:10.301 --> 15:11.968
But then she passed away.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.745
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:13.821 --> 15:17.040
-Thanks. It was a few years ago.
-Mm-hmm.

15:18.493 --> 15:21.085
Anyway, thank you,
thank you for this.

15:21.162 --> 15:22.995
[nikki] I owe you one.
[gavin] okay.

15:23.148 --> 15:25.648
Um, buy me a coffee,
we'll call it even.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.592
Um, don't you get free coffee
at work?

15:27.669 --> 15:31.429
Yeah, but it's always better
when someone else makes it.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.656
Hm. Oh.

15:33.675 --> 15:36.434
I have to pick up my daughter
from school soon, so...

15:36.585 --> 15:40.188
Okay. Maybe later this week?
You know where to find me.

15:41.516 --> 15:44.442
Hey, liz. Always a pleasure.

15:46.595 --> 15:47.904
Bye, nikki.

15:51.025 --> 15:52.842
He just dropped by.

15:52.844 --> 15:55.845
I know. That's gavin.

15:55.863 --> 15:59.273
Hey, I couldn't help but
overhear. Is everything okay?

15:59.292 --> 16:03.277
Oh, sure.
It's pretty typical dan.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.547
Come on, I'll show you how to
lock up. Lights are in the back.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.196
You've been quiet
this afternoon.

16:13.214 --> 16:15.807
Hm? How was your first day?

16:15.958 --> 16:18.625
-Fine.
-Whoa, slow down.

16:18.645 --> 16:22.647
I can't keep up
with all this information.

16:22.724 --> 16:25.483
I didn't know anyone, all
my classes are either way ahead

16:25.634 --> 16:27.893
Or way behind
from where I was back home,

16:28.046 --> 16:29.879
And I forgot my lunch
in the car.

16:29.897 --> 16:33.157
-So not a stellar first day.
-No.

16:33.309 --> 16:36.902
Give it time, sweetheart.
I know you'll make friends soon.

16:37.055 --> 16:40.331
-[doorbell rings]
-shall we let our guests in?

16:46.080 --> 16:47.171
-Hi!
-Hi, brooke!

16:47.248 --> 16:49.398
-This is my daughter anna.
-Hi.

16:49.417 --> 16:52.826
-Hi, anna. I'm nikki.
-My mom told me about you.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.329
-Mostly good things.
-[all chuckling]

16:55.348 --> 16:57.073
Why don't you come in?

16:57.091 --> 16:58.574
...And the boxes came,
and it turned out

16:58.593 --> 17:02.770
I hadn't ordered 12,
I had ordered 12 dozen.

17:03.931 --> 17:05.748
Well, I am happy my first day

17:05.767 --> 17:07.583
Went a little smoother
than that.

17:07.602 --> 17:11.863
Speaking of, how was your
first day of school, brooke?

17:12.014 --> 17:14.348
-Fine.
-It's an adjustment.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.867
It'll take some getting used to.

17:15.943 --> 17:17.276
[anna] I totally know
how you feel.

17:17.428 --> 17:19.037
I moved up to the high school
last year.

17:19.188 --> 17:20.705
-I was so scared.
-You were?

17:20.856 --> 17:23.266
Took me a while,
but now I love it.

17:23.284 --> 17:25.877
-Who are your teachers?
-Uh, my schedule is in my room.

17:26.028 --> 17:28.046
-Mom, can we go get it?
-Sure.

17:33.628 --> 17:35.369
She really opened up to anna.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.130
I haven't gotten
more than two words all day.

17:38.283 --> 17:39.706
It's probably nice
for her to talk

17:39.726 --> 17:42.118
To someone closer to her age.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.470
Brooke needs a friend right now.

17:44.622 --> 17:46.731
Liz, thank you for everything
you're doing.

17:46.882 --> 17:48.974
First the job, and now anna...

17:49.127 --> 17:51.694
We all need a friend
every now and then.

17:54.465 --> 17:58.301
So, what brought gavin
by the store today?

17:58.319 --> 18:01.412
Oh, uh,
he was returning my keychain.

18:01.564 --> 18:03.155
He had your keychain?

18:03.308 --> 18:06.492
Ah, it keeps falling off.
It just needs to get fixed.

18:06.644 --> 18:10.146
And now he wants to take you
for coffee?

18:10.164 --> 18:12.648
Well, liz, I don't wanna step
on any toes--

18:12.667 --> 18:15.242
Uh, no, it's, it's not that.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.670
[nikki] are you sure?
If you still have feelings...

18:17.822 --> 18:21.324
Oh, nikki,
gavin and I are definitely over.

18:21.342 --> 18:22.825
He was clingy,
and I couldn't stand it.

18:22.844 --> 18:26.604
And truth is,
I'm, I'm just concerned.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.499
Concerned? Why?

18:30.518 --> 18:35.113
I don't wanna overstep,
but I just want you to be okay.

18:36.190 --> 18:38.341
Why wouldn't I be?

18:38.359 --> 18:39.784
[brooke] mom,
can we have dessert now?

18:39.861 --> 18:43.121
Uh, sure. Why don't you help me
clear the table?

18:49.871 --> 18:51.462
I'll be right back.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.693
-Did you grab the salad bowl?
-No, not yet.

18:57.712 --> 18:59.119
I'll get it.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.139
[liz] and you're acting
like this at someone's house?

19:01.290 --> 19:03.624
[anna] because you're being
like this at someone's house.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.886
Anna, you're two years away
from even applying to colleges.

19:07.038 --> 19:10.723
He said you'd say no. Why're you
still so angry with dad? If--

19:10.875 --> 19:13.133
Anna, I'm not discussing this
right now.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.820
-Fine.
-Uh, where are you going?

19:15.971 --> 19:20.140
The bathroom.
Or can't I go there, either?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.309
[anna] you're so controlling.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.163
Sorry, I didn't mean
to eavesdrop.

19:25.239 --> 19:27.890
Is everything okay?

19:27.909 --> 19:30.001
I've learned with dan
if you give him an inch,

19:30.152 --> 19:32.670
He'll take a light year.

19:32.747 --> 19:36.323
I just have to hold
my boundaries, that's all.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.325
Would you like
a little more wine?

19:38.344 --> 19:40.928
Mm, I'd like a lot more wine.

19:42.256 --> 19:44.573
[liz sighs] thank you.

19:44.592 --> 19:47.076
So what about brooke's dad?

19:47.094 --> 19:50.429
Uh, there's not much to say.

19:50.581 --> 19:53.191
He left after he found out
I was pregnant

19:53.267 --> 19:56.585
And then came back for a couple
months after brooke was born

19:56.604 --> 19:58.604
And then disappeared again.

19:58.756 --> 20:01.090
Drifted in and out
every few years,

20:01.108 --> 20:04.535
Breaking brooke's heart
every time.

20:04.612 --> 20:06.037
I'm sorry.

20:06.188 --> 20:07.446
I never really dated,

20:07.598 --> 20:10.875
Always hoping
he'd get his act together.

20:10.952 --> 20:13.211
[chuckles] stupid, huh?

20:13.287 --> 20:16.105
Not stupid. Sounds like he was.

20:16.123 --> 20:17.606
Well, I finally stopped waiting

20:17.608 --> 20:20.718
And moved us here
for a fresh start.

20:22.037 --> 20:23.512
To new lives.

20:36.127 --> 20:37.293
-Mom?
-Hm?

20:37.311 --> 20:39.295
Can I take music lessons?

20:39.297 --> 20:40.821
Music lessons?

20:42.650 --> 20:45.150
Yeah, uh, there's music classes
at school.

20:45.303 --> 20:46.802
I wanna play guitar.

20:46.821 --> 20:49.396
Oh, brooke,
I wish I could say yes,

20:49.415 --> 20:50.748
But we really don't have
the extra money

20:50.825 --> 20:52.491
For an instrument right now.

20:52.643 --> 20:55.160
But, look, you can join
the choir for free.

20:55.313 --> 20:56.754
I don't like to sing.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.593
I'm sorry, honey.
Maybe next year.

21:07.825 --> 21:10.083
Thank you for shopping with us.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.328
Oh, I have to run to the bank.

21:12.346 --> 21:13.679
You okay on your own
for a few minutes?

21:13.831 --> 21:15.422
I think so.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.775
-Bring you a coffee?
-Oh, you're an angel.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.620
-Thank you for shopping with us.
-Thanks.

21:32.517 --> 21:34.183
-Hey.
-Hi!

21:34.201 --> 21:35.868
I hadn't heard from you
about coffee,

21:36.020 --> 21:38.462
So latte with almond milk,
right?

21:38.539 --> 21:39.705
You remembered.

21:39.857 --> 21:41.040
Well, it's hard
to forget an order

21:41.192 --> 21:42.758
After you dump it
all over someone.

21:44.378 --> 21:47.530
Uh, sorry I didn't stop by.

21:47.548 --> 21:51.291
-Things have been really busy.
-No, I get it, I get it.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.552
-How are, how are things going?
-Good.

21:53.704 --> 21:56.630
Yeah, I think I'm getting
the hang of things around here.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.391
-How's brooke?
-Oh, a little slower to adjust.

21:59.544 --> 22:01.894
She's mad at me because
I can't get her a guitar.

22:02.046 --> 22:04.155
-For her music lessons.
-Oh.

22:04.306 --> 22:06.048
-That's a shame.
-Oh, it's fine.

22:06.067 --> 22:08.717
She's 12, she'll be upset
or super stoked

in a few days.

22:10.738 --> 22:12.813

22:12.832 --> 22:15.908
Hey, um, I have a couple tickets

22:16.060 --> 22:18.169

22:18.320 --> 22:20.671
-What? I thought they broke up.
-They did.

22:20.748 --> 22:22.731
But a few members
are doing a benefit concert.

22:22.750 --> 22:26.585
And my friend canceled
last minute, and I thought

22:26.737 --> 22:29.830
Maybe you'd like to join me.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.667
I love them, but I wouldn't
wanna take your extra ticket.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.912

Well...

25:07.732 --> 25:09.256
Shall we?

25:11.010 --> 25:12.968
-[chuckles]
-[upbeat music]

25:14.588 --> 25:19.908

<i> ♪ she's got her shades</i>
<i> all see those... ♪</i>

25:23.097 --> 25:26.915
He was awesome. That solo
on white roses? It was epic.

25:26.934 --> 25:28.675
-I'm glad you had fun.
-Yeah.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.420
Best night I've had in a while.

25:31.438 --> 25:35.866
Hey, what do you say we pop into
the cafe for a little dessert?

25:37.278 --> 25:39.185
Oh, I don't know.
It's getting late.

25:39.205 --> 25:42.114
Oh, it's not that late, plus,
I have a caramel cheesecake

25:42.266 --> 25:44.041
To die for.

25:44.118 --> 25:48.028
A little nightcap for
your "best night in a while."

25:48.047 --> 25:50.464
Okay. A quick dessert.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.700
[nikki] so what did you do?

25:53.719 --> 25:55.535
What any savvy
business owner would.

25:55.555 --> 25:59.723
I-I gave him a month's supply
of free coffee and muffins.

26:02.119 --> 26:05.229
Hey, um, I need to tell you
something.

26:05.306 --> 26:08.624
I know it's not cool to talk
about exes on first dates,

26:08.642 --> 26:13.053
But, uh,
liz and I dated for a bit.

26:13.072 --> 26:16.056
-I know. She told me.
-Oh, okay, good.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.483
[chuckles] I didn't want
things to get awkward

26:18.636 --> 26:23.563
If we were to go
on another date, or dates.

26:23.583 --> 26:26.166
Well, I respect your honesty.

26:28.979 --> 26:33.573
Is it okay if I ask, um,
there's not an angry ex-husband

26:33.593 --> 26:35.651
That's gonna get up
in my face, is there?

26:35.669 --> 26:40.172
Angry is highly probable,
showing up is very unlikely.

26:40.324 --> 26:41.748
[sighs] I'm sorry.
I-I shouldn't have asked.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.435
-We don't have to talk about it.
-It's okay. Yeah.

26:44.511 --> 26:49.273
Brooke's father promised
to be the dad that she wanted,

26:49.350 --> 26:50.941
Promised to be the husband
that I wanted,

26:51.018 --> 26:54.686
But, um, he couldn't do it.

26:54.839 --> 26:58.598
And actions speak louder
than words, as they say, so...

26:58.618 --> 27:02.936
That's unbelievable.
You and brooke are so amazing.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.031
Thank you. Yeah, we have
a much better life now.

27:06.183 --> 27:08.851
-Yeah.
-What about you? Hm?

27:08.869 --> 27:11.444
Never married? No kids?

27:11.464 --> 27:13.538
Uh, no. No, not anymore.

27:13.691 --> 27:15.633
Oh, gavin, I-I'm sorry--

27:15.784 --> 27:18.026
No, no, no, no.
It's, uh, it's-it's fine.

27:18.045 --> 27:21.621
I-I, I never talk about it
with anyone.

27:21.641 --> 27:24.808
But, but you,
you're, you're easy to talk to.

27:26.887 --> 27:28.553
Years ago I was
with this really great woman,

27:28.706 --> 27:31.106
And we got, uh, pregnant
while we were dating.

27:33.227 --> 27:37.946
We had a, we had a girl...
Violet.

27:40.234 --> 27:44.144
She was two months
when she died of sids.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.979
Oh, gavin, I'm so sorry.

27:45.998 --> 27:49.667
Yeah, yeah, it's just,
it's one of those stories

27:49.818 --> 27:53.653
You hear about other people,
you know, and...

27:53.673 --> 27:55.488
Well, needless to say, um,
losing her

27:55.508 --> 27:57.916
Didn't bring us closer together.

27:58.068 --> 28:01.679
Yeah, I get that.
What a thing to go through.

28:03.257 --> 28:07.184
Hey, thank you.
I'm glad you told me.

28:09.763 --> 28:12.414
It's getting late.
I gotta get you home.

28:12.433 --> 28:14.750
Right. Anna will probably
be wondering where I am.

28:14.752 --> 28:16.360
[both chuckling]

28:17.421 --> 28:19.488
-Here.
-Thanks.

28:24.111 --> 28:25.327
[nikki] um...

28:27.264 --> 28:31.208
Oh. I've wanted to do that
since the first time I saw you.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.119
Gavin, I...

28:34.271 --> 28:36.880
Oh, this doesn't sound like
it's gonna be good.

28:36.957 --> 28:39.866
It's just that, um,
I'm just getting settled,

28:39.885 --> 28:41.552
And I've got brooke
to think about.

28:41.628 --> 28:44.388
And I'm just not ready
to jump into anything too fast.

28:44.465 --> 28:47.224
I understand. Yeah, I mean,
we'll-we'll take it slow.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.636
I just like
spending time with you.

28:51.789 --> 28:54.231
I really like spending time
with you, too.

28:54.382 --> 28:56.567
Okay, then that's all
this needs to be,

28:56.718 --> 29:00.821
Just two people
spending time together.

29:11.825 --> 29:13.083
-[nikki humming]
-[pop song on radio]

29:20.926 --> 29:23.335
Someone's in a good mood.

29:23.487 --> 29:25.578
Would this have anything to do
with your date last night?

29:25.598 --> 29:29.341
I wouldn't call it a date.
Not exactly.

29:29.493 --> 29:31.751
And don't worry,
we talked and we agreed,

29:31.771 --> 29:34.329
We are taking it slow.

29:34.348 --> 29:36.023
[door opens]

29:38.593 --> 29:41.695
-These are for you.
-Thank you.

29:46.527 --> 29:48.619
Taking it slow, huh?

29:53.367 --> 29:56.293
[song continues]

30:08.382 --> 30:11.383
-[guitar music]
-[anna chuckles] good job.

30:11.535 --> 30:13.293
-Thanks.
-[nikki] all right.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.720
You girls have fun today.

30:15.873 --> 30:17.389
I should only be at the store
for a few hours.

30:17.541 --> 30:19.057
I thought you weren't leaving
until 12:00.

30:19.209 --> 30:20.800
I am going to get a coffee
first with gavin.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.303
It is our one-month anniversary.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.470
[anna and brooke] ooh!

30:24.490 --> 30:27.324
All right. I'll see you later.

30:36.410 --> 30:38.001
-Hey.
-Hi.

30:41.582 --> 30:43.841
-Just in time for my break.
-Mm-hmm.

30:46.661 --> 30:48.512
[gavin]<i> I think I'm gonna name</i>
<i> a drink after you on the menu.</i>

30:48.663 --> 30:50.255
What's it gonna be called?

30:50.407 --> 30:52.850
[laughs] what? What?

30:53.001 --> 30:55.435
No, you're just, you're
just adorable, that's all.

30:56.914 --> 31:00.190
Hey, I, um, I got you something.

31:02.344 --> 31:03.360
Open it.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.520
Gavin, what did you do?

31:14.540 --> 31:16.264
Well, you said
you always wanted to go.

31:16.283 --> 31:18.600
And I've been itching
to get out of town, so...

31:18.619 --> 31:20.452
-This is too much!
-Do you like it?

31:20.604 --> 31:22.963
-I love it, but...
-[cell phone vibrates]

31:26.218 --> 31:27.959
Oh, shoot, it's liz.

31:28.112 --> 31:29.461
-I gotta go.
-You gotta go already?

31:29.613 --> 31:32.205
I was supposed to be there
ten minutes ago.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.707
-I'll call you later.
-Okay. Yeah.

31:34.727 --> 31:36.059
Thank you.

31:37.137 --> 31:38.729
This is amazing.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.889
Sorry. I didn't realize
how late it was.

31:49.909 --> 31:52.576
Oh, it's calmed down now.
It's not like you to be late.

31:52.727 --> 31:56.413
-I know, I was with gavin.
-Of course.

31:57.658 --> 31:59.141
What's that?

31:59.143 --> 32:03.587
Oh, um, gavin wants
to take me to ireland.

32:03.664 --> 32:05.923
-Ireland?
-Hm.

32:05.999 --> 32:10.076
He's already bought the tickets?
These are first class.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.745
-He must have spent thousands.
-What? Really?

32:12.765 --> 32:15.173
Nikki, this is the exact
opposite of taking it slow.

32:15.325 --> 32:17.993
Can I leave this with you?
Thanks.

32:18.011 --> 32:19.436
Let's chat later.

32:27.187 --> 32:29.262
[liz]<i> you know</i>
<i> I see a lot of myself in you.</i>

32:29.281 --> 32:31.356
[nikki] I do.

32:31.508 --> 32:33.842
Well, I made a few mistakes
when I was younger,

32:33.860 --> 32:37.788
And I don't wanna see you
make the same ones I did.

32:37.864 --> 32:40.791
But I'm seeing some red flags
with gavin

32:40.867 --> 32:42.292
That you may not be seeing.

32:42.444 --> 32:45.111
Red flags?

32:45.130 --> 32:47.022
[sighs]

32:47.024 --> 32:50.358
Well, you know, dan,
my ex-husband, he was a charmer.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.785
We met
when I was down on my luck,

32:52.805 --> 32:55.455
Then he came swooping in
like a savior.

32:55.474 --> 32:59.367
Expensive gifts,
lots of compliments.

32:59.386 --> 33:01.369
Only a few months
after we started dating,

33:01.388 --> 33:05.557
He had me moving in with him
and quitting my job.

33:05.709 --> 33:09.544
I couldn't see or maybe I didn't
wanna see what he was doing.

33:09.563 --> 33:11.405
Which was what?

33:12.232 --> 33:14.491
Isolating me.

33:14.642 --> 33:17.402
Making me rely on him so that
I didn't have an identity

33:17.554 --> 33:20.980
Outside of our relationship.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.227
Okay, um, what does this
have to do with gavin?

33:25.245 --> 33:28.821
Dating gavin was like
dan, the sequel.

33:28.841 --> 33:32.509
The charm, the smile,
the flowers, the gifts,

33:32.586 --> 33:36.738
And then it all turned.

33:36.757 --> 33:38.590
Wanting to spend
all of our time together,

33:38.742 --> 33:41.576
And getting jealous
whenever I had other plans.

33:41.595 --> 33:43.762
It was, it was exhausting.

33:43.914 --> 33:48.266
So I broke it off,
and it got ugly.

33:48.418 --> 33:51.511
Really? Well, you seem
to get along fine now.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.439
Yeah, only because I avoid him
whenever I can.

33:54.591 --> 33:56.700
Liz, gavin's been through a lot.

33:56.777 --> 33:59.944
Well, maybe he just moves fast
because he's afraid of losing

34:00.097 --> 34:02.447
What he's got again.

34:02.599 --> 34:03.874
Maybe.

34:04.025 --> 34:07.711
I, I'm only telling you
my experience.

34:07.862 --> 34:11.631
Look, nikki, I don't want
to control your life.

34:13.701 --> 34:15.277
I-if you wanna
keep seeing gavin,

34:15.295 --> 34:17.637
Then I won't stand in your way.

34:18.965 --> 34:22.726
But just watch
for the red flags.

34:29.126 --> 34:30.859
I'm gonna grab some more wine.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.579
-King me.
-Whoa, whoa!

34:42.730 --> 34:44.748
-Are you sure you didn't cheat?
-Mom!

34:44.899 --> 34:46.566
[knocking on door]

34:46.585 --> 34:48.418
Was anna coming back?

34:51.498 --> 34:53.423
[brooke] hey, gavin.
[gavin] hey, brooke.

34:53.500 --> 34:56.409
-How's the guitar going?
-Good. I learned a nirvana song.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.261
Nirvana? You're gonna
have to show me that.

34:58.413 --> 35:00.338
-Okay, I'll go get my guitar.
-Actually...

35:00.490 --> 35:02.490
Can you give your mom and I
a few minutes first?

35:02.509 --> 35:04.434
-[brooke] sure.
-Thanks.

35:05.996 --> 35:08.772
Gavin, what are you doing here?
Hi.

35:08.923 --> 35:10.515
Um, well, I wanted to finish
our conversation

35:10.667 --> 35:11.666
From this afternoon.

35:11.668 --> 35:12.684
Okay.

35:12.836 --> 35:15.362
Um, I got something for you.

35:18.766 --> 35:20.242
Gavin, it...

35:32.131 --> 35:34.589
Wow. It's beautiful.

35:37.544 --> 35:40.953
I know we've only known
each other a little while,

35:40.973 --> 35:43.365
But it feels like much longer.

35:43.383 --> 35:45.642
Look, I had this whole speech
about the necklace

35:45.793 --> 35:47.369
And the trip
and what it all represents,

35:47.371 --> 35:49.371
But that's kinda feeling cheesy
right now,

35:49.389 --> 35:51.148
So I'm just gonna say it.

35:52.542 --> 35:55.468
I'd like you to move in.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.212
Move-move in with you?

35:57.214 --> 35:58.546
Yeah, I-I saw
how you had to rush

35:58.565 --> 36:00.215
Into the store today,
on a weekend...

36:00.233 --> 36:02.659
-Well, I had to work.
-But what if you didn't have to?

36:02.810 --> 36:04.995
You're struggling to make
ends meet in a dead-end job--

36:05.071 --> 36:06.404
-Dead-end job?
-I just mean...

36:06.556 --> 36:08.665
You're capable of so much more

36:08.742 --> 36:11.334
With just a little bit of help
to get back on your feet.

36:11.486 --> 36:13.670
I know this is a big step,
but, nikki,

36:13.747 --> 36:17.299
I've, I've never felt like this
about anyone before.

36:18.251 --> 36:21.236
And after losing violet,

36:21.254 --> 36:24.764
I-I, I didn't think
I could be this happy again.

36:25.909 --> 36:27.258
-What about brooke?
-Well...

36:27.411 --> 36:28.518
My place has lots of space.

36:28.670 --> 36:29.669
It's closer to her school,

36:29.688 --> 36:31.246
She could walk if she wanted.

36:31.248 --> 36:33.005
She's just getting settled
after the move.

36:33.025 --> 36:35.250
I need to think about
what's best for her.

36:35.268 --> 36:36.751
Well, maybe what's best for her

36:36.770 --> 36:38.195
Is a little financial stability

36:38.271 --> 36:40.772
And-and a mom
who can be there for her more.

36:40.924 --> 36:43.366
Well, are you saying
I'm neglecting my daughter?

36:43.518 --> 36:46.594
No, no, not at all.
W... Where are you getting that?

36:46.596 --> 36:49.689
I-I, I-I don't know,
it's just, t-things are moving

36:49.708 --> 36:52.600
A lot faster than I'm ready for.

36:52.602 --> 36:54.602
I know we haven't exactly
taken things slow,

36:54.621 --> 36:59.123
But, nikki, I think we can
make each other really happy.

36:59.276 --> 37:02.535
Gavin, I'm not ready

37:02.554 --> 37:04.387
For a serious relationship
right now.

37:04.464 --> 37:06.872
And I, I ignored a lot of
red flags in my last relatio--

37:06.892 --> 37:09.226
What, what? Red flags?

37:10.562 --> 37:13.563
I think
we need to take a step back.

37:23.224 --> 37:27.469
I really, really like you,
gavin.

37:27.487 --> 37:29.663
We just want different things
right now.

37:32.251 --> 37:34.400
I'm, I'm sorry
if I pushed too hard.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.327
It's only 'cause, you know,
I-I really like you. I--

37:36.480 --> 37:40.090
Don't be sorry. I had
a really great time with you.

37:40.166 --> 37:42.342
Just not the right timing.

37:44.170 --> 37:46.346
Right. Right.

[sighs] okay.

37:53.497 --> 37:54.662
Will you tell brooke
I said goodbye?

37:54.681 --> 37:56.022
Of course.

37:56.666 --> 37:57.732
Okay.

38:13.033 --> 38:17.627
-Hey.
-Hey. I'm just tidying up.

38:17.704 --> 38:21.131
I know. The store
has never been so clean.

38:21.282 --> 38:23.541
It's almost like
you're avoiding me.

38:23.693 --> 38:25.135
I'm not avoiding you.

38:26.530 --> 38:29.306
Okay, yes, I am avoiding you.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.200
Why?

38:32.202 --> 38:34.311
I broke things off with gavin
last night.

38:34.462 --> 38:35.812
Oh, nikki.

38:35.889 --> 38:37.722
He came to my house unannounced

38:37.874 --> 38:39.557
And asked me
to move in with him.

38:39.709 --> 38:42.319
-Yikes. What did you say?
-I panicked.

38:42.470 --> 38:45.880
I kept hearing your voice in
my head, so I basically told him

38:45.899 --> 38:49.826
Too much, too fast,
too many red flags.

38:49.977 --> 38:53.054
-I'm sorry.
-[chuckles] I mean, sorry?

38:53.073 --> 38:55.239
You suggested it.

38:55.392 --> 38:57.667
That doesn't mean
I wanna see you sad.

38:57.819 --> 39:01.004
-I know.
-Trust me.

39:01.081 --> 39:05.008
In the long run,
I think it's better this way.

39:05.159 --> 39:07.827
I only hope
I made the right choice.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.347
I just don't wanna look back
and regret it.

39:10.498 --> 39:13.183
[liz] no, I don't think
you will, nikki.

39:14.186 --> 39:15.852
It's for the best.

39:16.003 --> 39:17.479
Thank you.

40:01.474 --> 40:04.401
Ah. I've told you not to call me
during business hours.

40:06.312 --> 40:09.572
Uh, liz, I just have to go
pick up brooke from guitar.

40:09.649 --> 40:12.650
Hold on a sec.
No worries. Tell her I say hi.

40:12.802 --> 40:16.246
-You okay? 'cause I can stay.
-Oh. It's dan. I'm fine.

40:16.397 --> 40:18.081
Okay, well,
I can come back afterwards,

40:18.232 --> 40:20.308
Put out some sale signs,
clearance tags?

40:20.326 --> 40:23.253
I can handle
a roll of masking tape.

40:23.404 --> 40:26.256
-See you tomorrow, girlie.
-Okay. Bye.

40:27.484 --> 40:29.984
[liz] okay. What's so important?

40:29.986 --> 40:33.263
No. I'm not discussing
this again.

41:16.049 --> 41:19.458
I've just been wondering
what if I made the wrong call.

I know you had
a bad relationship with dan,

wanna ask you a few questions.

Of course.

When was the last time
you talked to ms. Cole?

We spoke a few hours ago
on the phone.

E-earlier today
I saw her here at the store.

45:42.741 --> 45:45.074
Did you notice anything unusual?

45:45.151 --> 45:46.467
Not really. Well...

45:46.486 --> 45:48.152
We were prepping a sale

45:48.304 --> 45:51.138
To clear out some old stock.

45:51.157 --> 45:54.066
Does the store
have a camera system?

45:54.085 --> 45:56.252
I don't think so.
Liz never mentioned one.

45:56.403 --> 45:57.587
Okay.

45:59.758 --> 46:01.424
[banks] you said you came back
around midnight?

46:01.501 --> 46:02.908
[nikki] yes.

46:02.927 --> 46:05.577
We've been trying to contact
anna's father--

46:05.597 --> 46:08.322
I don't think
that's a good idea.

46:08.341 --> 46:10.174
-Why's that?
-Liz has custody.

46:10.326 --> 46:13.661
I just don't think
she'd want anna going with dan.

46:13.679 --> 46:15.938
I'll talk to dcfs. We'll see
if we can find her a tempo--

46:16.015 --> 46:17.273
I can take her.

46:17.350 --> 46:18.941
I don't know
if they'll agree to that.

46:19.018 --> 46:20.759
Detective,
her mother just went missing.

46:20.779 --> 46:23.170
The last thing she needs
is to be with some stranger

46:23.172 --> 46:24.338
For the night.

46:24.357 --> 46:25.597
I'll see what I can do.

46:25.617 --> 46:26.932
[nikki] thank you.

46:26.951 --> 46:28.692
Uh, detective?

46:28.845 --> 46:31.846
You should talk to dan,
though, about liz.

46:31.848 --> 46:33.790
I heard them arguing earlier.

46:33.866 --> 46:36.042
[banks] was that unusual
that they argued?

46:37.370 --> 46:39.278
No. They fought all the time.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.963
Did this fight
sound any different?

No, not really.

my daughter from guitar.

You said you talked to liz
after that.

46:49.974 --> 46:51.549
Yes, around 8:00, and she said

46:51.701 --> 46:53.868
Everything was fine.

46:53.886 --> 46:55.870
We'll have to lock down
the crime scene for a few days

looks things over. Okay?

47:00.059 --> 47:03.878

47:03.896 --> 47:05.446
How likely is it...

47:06.899 --> 47:10.568
Uh, ms. Hansen,
every case is different,

47:10.720 --> 47:13.329
And we have to see
where the evidence leads.

As soon as I can, I promise.

50:44.375 --> 50:45.857
-Dad!
-I promise.

50:45.877 --> 50:49.270
I'm gonna be back to get
you as soon as I can.

50:49.272 --> 50:50.546
Okay?

50:59.131 --> 51:01.448
[door opens]

51:01.467 --> 51:03.392
-Anna.
-[door shuts]

51:06.397 --> 51:09.732
Things just keep getting worse,
don't they?

51:09.809 --> 51:11.883
You got a lot going on
right now and...

51:11.903 --> 51:13.069
-I'm just gonna go.
-[engine revving]

51:13.220 --> 51:14.487
Gavin...

51:15.314 --> 51:17.631
Would you...

51:17.633 --> 51:19.742
Will you stay a little while?

51:21.821 --> 51:23.079
Of course.

51:25.491 --> 51:28.417
[instrumental music]

51:29.995 --> 51:33.839
-[sighs] thank you.
-No problem.

51:37.744 --> 51:38.910
How is she doin'?

51:38.930 --> 51:40.654
She finally fell back asleep.

51:40.673 --> 51:43.599
Poor thing,
she's completely exhausted.

51:43.750 --> 51:44.892
Yeah.

51:45.937 --> 51:48.437
You know, it's strange...

51:48.514 --> 51:50.848
What's that?

51:51.000 --> 51:54.351
Liz always talks about dan
like he's this monster,

51:54.503 --> 51:58.597
But he seems like a dad who's
concerned about his daughter.

51:58.616 --> 52:01.450
Are you saying liz was lying?

52:01.602 --> 52:04.011
No, no, not lying,

52:04.029 --> 52:06.938
But maybe biased?

52:06.958 --> 52:10.292
Well, he did get
pretty threatening.

52:10.369 --> 52:12.461
If someone told me
I couldn't take my daughter home

52:12.613 --> 52:15.447
From a stranger's house,
I don't know how I'd react.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.024
Yeah, but just because
he's a good father--

52:17.042 --> 52:19.360
It doesn't mean
that he's a good husband.

52:19.378 --> 52:20.619
I know.

52:20.638 --> 52:23.139
Or that
he wouldn't have hurt liz.

52:25.125 --> 52:27.292
Would he,
would he have a motive?

52:27.311 --> 52:30.312
I've been thinking about that.

52:30.389 --> 52:33.707
If liz is gone,
all of her assets go to anna.

52:33.726 --> 52:37.544
-But until anna turns 18...
-Dan's in charge.

52:37.563 --> 52:40.898
And he stands to inherit
his ex-wife's assets.

52:41.050 --> 52:43.159
-At least for a few years.
-Mm-hmm.

52:45.070 --> 52:49.723
Gavin, if he hurt liz

52:49.742 --> 52:51.667
To get to anna,

52:51.744 --> 52:53.744
I can't let him take her.

52:53.896 --> 52:57.006
Well, then we need to find out
what really happened.

52:59.660 --> 53:01.493
I know I said
things were moving too fast,

53:01.512 --> 53:04.071
But with everything going on,

53:04.073 --> 53:07.016
I'm really happy you're here.

53:08.928 --> 53:10.744
I'm glad to hear you say that.

53:10.763 --> 53:14.273
I've, um... Missed you.

53:19.012 --> 53:21.947
[dramatic music]

53:38.457 --> 53:41.884
-Anna...
-Why are you looking up my dad?

53:42.035 --> 53:44.445
You think he had something to do
with my mom?

53:44.463 --> 53:45.704
I don't know what to think.

53:45.723 --> 53:46.964
Is that why
I can't stay with him?

53:47.116 --> 53:50.117
No, it's complicated, anna.

53:50.135 --> 53:52.619
My dad has worked so hard
to be a different person,

53:52.621 --> 53:54.396
And my mom doesn't wanna see it.

53:54.548 --> 53:56.790
And now you won't, either.

53:56.809 --> 53:58.150
Anna...

54:02.723 --> 54:03.364
Anna.

54:08.061 --> 54:08.827
[gavin] do the police have
any new leads?

54:10.155 --> 54:11.972
So what are you gonna do now?

54:11.974 --> 54:14.308
[sighs] what can I do?

54:14.326 --> 54:17.235
Wait for the police
to investigate.

54:17.255 --> 54:19.646
Nikki, liz could be
in real trouble.

54:19.648 --> 54:22.091
-And if dan's behind it--
-we don't know that he is.

54:22.242 --> 54:23.759
You know what she said
about him.

54:23.836 --> 54:25.928
I-I know, I know.

54:26.079 --> 54:29.932
More and more I'm wondering what
if liz isn't telling the truth?

54:30.009 --> 54:33.251
What if there was
a side to her that...

54:33.271 --> 54:34.687
I don't know.

54:36.015 --> 54:38.607
-There is.
-What?

54:39.610 --> 54:41.593
What do you mean?

54:41.612 --> 54:43.261
Look, I didn't wanna say
anything, I know you and liz

54:43.281 --> 54:46.115
Are friends, and I-I don't
wanna speak ill of her.

54:46.191 --> 54:48.784
Gavin, what is it?
You have to tell me.

54:48.935 --> 54:51.011
I just think
there's a side of her

54:51.013 --> 54:54.181
That's kind of cruel.

54:54.183 --> 54:55.849
I don't know how else to say it.

54:55.868 --> 54:58.961
She seemed to enjoy making life
difficult for people.

54:59.112 --> 55:01.355
How?

55:01.357 --> 55:04.133
Well, one day she'd be angry
that she hadn't heard from you

55:04.284 --> 55:06.193
And the next she acted like
you were smothering her.

55:06.211 --> 55:08.804
Like, you couldn't win.
And it wasn't just me.

55:08.881 --> 55:11.623
She burned through employees
like crazy.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.809
Even her own daughter.

55:13.886 --> 55:17.704
Anna can only see her dad
on liz's terms.

55:17.723 --> 55:21.317
Anna told me once that her and
her dad used to be very close.

55:21.393 --> 55:24.878
I wonder if he got tired
of being cut out.

55:24.897 --> 55:27.305
We don't know
that that's what happened.

55:27.325 --> 55:30.159
I just feel like dan's involved.

55:30.235 --> 55:34.163
What if...
What if we kept an eye on him?

55:34.314 --> 55:36.832
-But how do we do that?
-I have a friend.

55:36.983 --> 55:40.502
He's an-an old college roommate.
He's a pi.

55:40.654 --> 55:43.505
-Private investigator?
-He owes me a favor.

55:44.567 --> 55:46.233
I-I-I don't know, gavin.

55:46.251 --> 55:48.827
Maybe we should just give
the police a little more time.

55:48.846 --> 55:51.162
And let the trail run cold?
Tell you what?

55:51.182 --> 55:53.073
Tell you what, let me call him.

55:53.092 --> 55:55.075
Maybe he'll agree
that it's a police problem.

55:55.077 --> 55:56.852
But at least we'll know.

55:58.931 --> 56:00.839
I guess.

56:00.858 --> 56:02.858
I'll let you know
as soon as I hear from him.

56:04.937 --> 56:08.030
Thank you, gavin, I...

56:08.181 --> 56:10.366
I don't know what I'd do
if you weren't here.

56:11.869 --> 56:13.827
You won't have to find out.

57:20.846 --> 57:23.087
Uh, I'm not
one-hundred percent sure,

57:23.107 --> 57:24.756
But I-I think
I've got something.

57:24.775 --> 57:27.276
-Uh, what is it?
-[gavin]<i> look, I-it's late.</i>

57:27.352 --> 57:29.093
Why don't you come to the cafe
in the morning, okay?

<i> I'll make you breakfast,</i>
<i> I'm guessing</i>

57:30.931 --> 57:32.673
<i> You've been too stressed</i>
<i> to eat.</i>

57:32.691 --> 57:36.434
Uh, okay. I'll come by after
I drop brooke off at school.

57:36.454 --> 57:38.412
Okay, okay, I'll see you then.

You understand?

58:43.412 --> 58:45.145
Brought you something to eat.

58:48.767 --> 58:51.610
Gavin, please...

58:52.863 --> 58:56.256
You have to let me out of here.

58:56.275 --> 59:01.185
See, I only wanted
to talk to you, liz.

59:01.205 --> 59:03.705
But you can't ever be
reasonable.

59:03.782 --> 59:06.458
If it's not your way,
you-you flip out.

59:07.786 --> 59:09.127
I'm sorry.

59:11.197 --> 59:14.883
Please, we can work this out
if you just let me out of here.

59:15.035 --> 59:17.778
See, nikki, she's easygoing.

59:17.780 --> 59:21.557
She gets me.
We clicked the moment we met.

59:23.452 --> 59:26.478
Well, you don't give up on love
like that.

59:28.307 --> 59:33.068
And without you around,
we actually have a real chance.

59:35.631 --> 59:37.388
What are you gonna do?

59:37.408 --> 59:39.557
You can't keep me here forever.

59:39.577 --> 59:41.151
I'll-I'll let you go.

59:41.303 --> 59:45.138
I just need to be sure
you'll keep your mouth shut.

59:45.157 --> 59:48.417
-Gavin, please--
-now, you want something to eat?

59:49.069 --> 59:50.252
Please.

59:51.922 --> 59:54.405
I won't say a word. Please.

59:54.425 --> 59:55.924
All right.

-Did you talk to your friend?
-I did, yeah.

1:00:22.602 --> 1:00:23.768
He said he was gonna
look into it,

1:00:23.787 --> 1:00:24.786
He found something right away.

1:00:24.938 --> 1:00:26.104
It turns out dan

1:00:26.123 --> 1:00:27.956
Has an online dating profile.

1:00:28.033 --> 1:00:29.958
Check out
his relationship status.

1:00:31.629 --> 1:00:33.945
-Widowed?
-And that's not all.

1:00:33.964 --> 1:00:36.298
He didn't turn
his bluetooth off, so my friend

1:00:36.449 --> 1:00:37.966
Pulled up a list of
recent locations on his phone.

1:00:38.043 --> 1:00:40.043
Well, these are all
near the store.

1:00:40.195 --> 1:00:43.697
He's been hanging around
the neighborhood for three days.

1:00:43.715 --> 1:00:45.699
Well, we need to show this
to the police.

1:00:45.717 --> 1:00:46.883
Well, we will,
but we'll need something

1:00:47.035 --> 1:00:48.292
A little more concrete
than this.

1:00:48.312 --> 1:00:50.720
Otherwise
the cops just blow it off.

-For liz.
-For liz.

Now, let's get you
something to eat. Hm?

1:01:00.565 --> 1:01:01.806
Would you like to hear
the breakfast specials?

1:01:01.825 --> 1:01:03.233
I also take requests.

1:01:03.385 --> 1:01:05.218

much of an appetite.

You can't help liz if
you don't take care of yourself.

So why don't you let me
take care of you?

1:01:58.774 --> 1:02:01.441
She's coping. Mm-hmm.

are taking care of her.

Would you please eat something?

Please, gavin,
you don't have to do this.

1:02:14.639 --> 1:02:18.124
Liz, I want you to see her.
Okay? I do.

1:02:18.126 --> 1:02:20.627
But how am I supposed to trust
what you're gonna do

1:02:20.629 --> 1:02:22.220
If I let you go?

1:02:22.239 --> 1:02:24.823

Y-yeah, I'm trying
to keep the store alive.

1:03:57.668 --> 1:04:01.169
I think liz would've wanted it
for her daughter.

1:04:01.246 --> 1:04:03.229
I just wanted to ask
a few more questions

1:04:03.248 --> 1:04:05.565
About your relationship
with elizabeth cole.

1:04:05.584 --> 1:04:08.401
-You two are close?
-Uh, she's my boss.

1:04:08.403 --> 1:04:10.178
And a friend.

1:04:10.330 --> 1:04:12.163
I understand there was conflict
between you two

1:04:12.182 --> 1:04:13.849
The day she disappeared.

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.076

-Something about a boyfriend?
-Oh, um, that's gavin.

No, no, we weren't fighting.
We had a disagreement--

-Was it about the store?
-The store?

1:04:27.197 --> 1:04:30.773
-Well, what's this?
-It's an amendment to her will.

of anna's inheritance,

-What? No.
-You didn't know about this?

1:04:40.102 --> 1:04:41.784
It appears
she had her attorney draft it

1:04:41.937 --> 1:04:44.045
Before she disappeared
last week.

1:04:45.607 --> 1:04:47.048
-I had no idea.
-So you're saying...

1:04:47.125 --> 1:04:48.775
-You didn't have a motive.
-Motive?

1:04:48.793 --> 1:04:51.887
D-detective, am I a suspect?

1:04:52.038 --> 1:04:54.538
You're a person of interest.

1:04:54.558 --> 1:04:57.951
I'd like to ask you a few more
questions down at the station.

1:04:57.969 --> 1:04:59.728
Maybe tomorrow afternoon?

1:05:02.399 --> 1:05:06.568
And, ms. Hansen, I suggest
that you consult a lawyer.

What am I supposed
to tell brooke?

1:05:25.738 --> 1:05:28.239
You really had no idea
she was adding you to her will?

1:05:28.258 --> 1:05:30.650
No, she didn't say anything,
and now the police are looking

1:05:30.669 --> 1:05:33.094
Into me, when they should be
looking into dan.

1:05:35.173 --> 1:05:37.340
[sighs] well,

1:05:37.492 --> 1:05:40.602
Just because the police
aren't watching dan

1:05:40.753 --> 1:05:42.920
Doesn't mean I can't.

1:05:42.940 --> 1:05:45.331
Why don't you get
your pi friend do it?

1:05:45.350 --> 1:05:47.091
He's on a case right now.

1:05:47.110 --> 1:05:48.610
It'll be fine.
Dan won't even know.

1:05:48.761 --> 1:05:50.094
-Gavin--
-hey, hey, hey.

1:05:50.113 --> 1:05:53.356
Liz was my friend, too.

1:05:53.508 --> 1:05:56.952
I thought you said
she made your life difficult.

1:05:58.288 --> 1:06:00.104
Well, yeah.

1:06:00.123 --> 1:06:03.700
We had a rough break-up.

1:06:03.852 --> 1:06:05.543
I'm not gonna deny that. Uh...

1:06:07.631 --> 1:06:09.689
But we still care
about each other.

1:06:09.708 --> 1:06:11.040
I'm not so sure
that goes both ways.

1:06:11.193 --> 1:06:13.209
She said some pretty harsh
things about you

1:06:13.361 --> 1:06:16.212
When we were dating.

1:06:16.364 --> 1:06:18.364
That's why I didn't know
what to believe about dan.

1:06:18.383 --> 1:06:21.142
She was so wrong about you.

1:06:21.294 --> 1:06:24.646
Nikki, I wanna make things
right.

1:06:25.631 --> 1:06:27.232

Nikki, have you heard
from my dad?

1:07:26.451 --> 1:07:29.026
-Not in a few days. Why?
-He's not answering his phone.

1:07:29.046 --> 1:07:31.954

Why don't you keep trying?

their phone here, I-I guess.

Look, after you broke it off

I went to the store
to talk to liz. I-I had to.

1:16:48.938 --> 1:16:51.847
I went to tell her
to leave us alone.

You should leave.

She was gonna ruin my life,
again.

1:18:14.265 --> 1:18:15.690

you don't wanna hurt anyone.

-No.

1:21:41.622 --> 1:21:44.973
Hey, you are safe now.

1:21:45.126 --> 1:21:48.551
Thank you, nikki,
for everything.

1:21:48.571 --> 1:21:49.904
I had to get you back.

1:21:50.055 --> 1:21:53.966
I don't wanna run the store
by myself.

1:21:53.984 --> 1:21:56.577
Oh, I think
you're due for a promotion.

1:21:56.728 --> 1:21:58.662
[laughing]

1:22:00.808 --> 1:22:04.810
Okay, you stay put.
I am gonna go get the car.

1:22:50.633 --> 1:22:53.950
So, what do you think,
store manager?

1:22:53.970 --> 1:22:55.043
I love it.

1:22:55.196 --> 1:22:57.120
Mom, liz, the store looks great.

1:22:57.139 --> 1:22:58.121
Thanks, brooke.

1:22:58.140 --> 1:22:59.473
[nikki] what do you think about

1:22:59.624 --> 1:23:01.809
Taco Tuesday

1:23:01.960 --> 1:23:04.219
I never say no to guacamole.

1:23:04.371 --> 1:23:05.887
I wanna show brooke
those new sweaters you got in.

1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:09.041
All right. Right there.

1:23:09.059 --> 1:23:11.318
Mom, text dad what to bring
to the barbeque on Sunday.

1:23:11.470 --> 1:23:13.045
Okay.

1:23:13.063 --> 1:23:15.714
You and dan seem to be
getting along well these days.

1:23:15.733 --> 1:23:18.993
Hm, we're both trying our best
for anna's sake.

1:23:19.144 --> 1:23:21.144
Something about having an ex
try and kill you

1:23:21.163 --> 1:23:24.498
Makes other exes
look not so bad.

1:23:24.649 --> 1:23:27.059
I have others
I can introduce you to.

1:23:27.077 --> 1:23:29.077
Uh, no thank you.

1:23:29.230 --> 1:23:33.582
I am gonna be concentrating
on my friendships right now.

1:23:33.734 --> 1:23:37.327
I can get onboard with that.
