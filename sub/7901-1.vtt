You are the new Gladiator Challenge
World Champion.

04:05.716 --> 04:07.741
And now to present
you with the belt

04:07.817 --> 04:09.546
of this prestigious
organization--

04:09.619 --> 04:10.677
Mr. Ted Williams.

04:12.855 --> 04:14.412
Diego, make us
proud, brother.

04:16.658 --> 04:18.853
Those were some highlights

04:18.927 --> 04:21.793
from Diego Carter's
championship match.

04:21.863 --> 04:23.831
As we spotlight

04:23.898 --> 04:26.390
World Cage Fighting
Champion Diego Carter,

04:26.468 --> 04:27.957
you can't help
but have compassion

04:28.036 --> 04:29.525
for this all-around athlete,

04:29.603 --> 04:32.095
for no other contender
in this league

04:32.173 --> 04:35.837
has ever worked so hard
to get to the top.

04:35.910 --> 04:38.969
His ascent to victory
was paved with hardship

04:39.046 --> 04:40.674
and humility.

04:40.749 --> 04:42.908
A fearless technician
whose punches carry

04:42.983 --> 04:44.950
the dreams
of a small child

04:45.018 --> 04:47.044
who grew up off
the coast of La Plata

04:47.120 --> 04:49.214
in rural Argentina.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.349
Now he makes his home
in Los Angeles

04:51.425 --> 04:53.086
the City of Angels,

04:53.159 --> 04:56.322
where he toils in the shadows
of the Hollywood limelight.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.192
Returning to the roots
of his legacy,

04:58.263 --> 05:01.029
Diego quickly gained
respect and notoriety

05:01.101 --> 05:02.795
in the martial
arts world

05:02.869 --> 05:05.359
by being the toughest
pound-for-pound fighter

05:05.437 --> 05:07.133
in his weight class,

05:07.207 --> 05:10.607
taking on each new rival
and ending victorious.

05:10.675 --> 05:13.110
No one can dispute
the sheer determination

05:13.177 --> 05:15.271
and willpower
of this champion.

05:15.345 --> 05:17.143
He trains tirelessly

05:17.217 --> 05:18.807
in anticipation
of every victory.

05:18.883 --> 05:22.615
He is a simple man capable
of extraordinary strength,

05:22.687 --> 05:24.780
speed and agility.

05:42.438 --> 05:44.703
We'll hear more
on Diego Carter

05:44.774 --> 05:46.708
right after this break.

05:55.918 --> 05:57.817

05:57.886 --> 05:59.477

06:08.562 --> 06:09.927

Come on, man.
l mean, we're gonna go party

06:24.710 --> 06:26.472
at the club anyway,
right?

06:26.545 --> 06:28.809
So why don't we bring some of your
female support group with us?

06:28.881 --> 06:30.541
l know you're not a big fan
of the party thing,

06:30.615 --> 06:33.016
but l think if you just invite a fan
or two or three or four--

06:33.086 --> 06:35.052
Four or five of 'em,
bro, seriously.

06:35.121 --> 06:37.986
Georgie Georgie calling.
Hey, what's up?

06:38.057 --> 06:39.785
Are you calling
to congratulate me?

06:39.858 --> 06:41.849
Half those moves
you learned from me, my friend.

06:41.927 --> 06:43.724
Well, l would
like to think

06:43.795 --> 06:46.229
l added a style
of my own to it.

06:46.297 --> 06:48.198
Are you coming to celebrate
at the club with us or what?

06:48.267 --> 06:49.927
Nah, you know what?

06:50.001 --> 06:51.490
It's your
victory party, bro.

06:51.569 --> 06:54.129
And if l show up,
everyone will hang out with me.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.297
All right, baby.

06:56.373 --> 06:57.898
I'll see you next week
at the gym again.

06:57.975 --> 06:59.567
Take it easy,
Diego, okay?

06:59.643 --> 07:01.109
Thank you, Georgie.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.713

07:05.783 --> 07:07.410

07:07.485 --> 07:09.247
who am l to
stop them, right?

07:09.319 --> 07:10.809
- Yes!
- Hell, yes!

07:10.886 --> 07:13.185
Diego, you are the man!

07:13.256 --> 07:15.917
Hey, let's go snatch up
those ring riders, man.

07:22.196 --> 07:24.165
This is the place.

07:24.233 --> 07:26.200
Party time.

07:26.267 --> 07:28.293
- Man, look at that line.
- Don't worry, man.

07:28.370 --> 07:32.203

07:32.272 --> 07:35.241

Cool.

07:44.651 --> 07:46.312

07:46.387 --> 07:48.355
It's already there.

07:48.421 --> 07:49.911
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

07:54.293 --> 07:55.761
Hey, man.
What you doing over here?

07:55.829 --> 07:57.694
l thought the gay club
was down the street.

07:59.964 --> 08:02.867
That's very funny,
but if l remember correctly,

08:02.936 --> 08:04.526
the last guy who
thought l was gay,

08:04.604 --> 08:06.365
l kicked his ass.

08:06.438 --> 08:08.463
There you go, always
thinking about my ass.

08:11.709 --> 08:14.075
We're just playing around.
Just our way of initiating you

08:14.146 --> 08:15.578
into the championship club.

08:15.646 --> 08:17.409
Hey, Diego!

08:17.481 --> 08:19.382
Yeah, l'm talking to you!

08:19.450 --> 08:21.246
You got shithouse lucky
in that fight, man,

08:21.318 --> 08:22.752
and you cost me money!

08:22.819 --> 08:26.152
You son of a bitch!
You cost me money!

08:26.224 --> 08:28.351
You should've bet
on the right fighter.

08:29.493 --> 08:31.358
You know what?
Let's do this.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.089
Let's just do this, guys.

08:33.162 --> 08:35.096
You buy us
all a drink, okay?

08:35.164 --> 08:37.029
You buy us all
a round of drinks,

08:37.099 --> 08:38.830
and maybe we might
forget about it.

08:38.902 --> 08:41.994
- How's that?
- We already forgot about you.

08:42.070 --> 08:44.096
Shit, you ain't half
as big as you look on TV.

08:44.173 --> 08:46.300
Why don't you just do
like you do when you fight

08:46.375 --> 08:48.935
and run away-- all of you bunch
of fucking track stars?

08:49.012 --> 08:50.639
l don't think you guys
even know how to fight

08:50.713 --> 08:52.179
on the friggin' streets.

08:52.247 --> 08:54.045
We only fight
in the cage, homie.

08:56.218 --> 08:59.209
He says-- he says
''We only fight in the fucking cage.''

09:02.222 --> 09:04.157
You gotta pivot
when you punch.

09:40.425 --> 09:42.484
You been drinking, huh?

09:44.162 --> 09:45.925
l love this place, man!

09:48.467 --> 09:49.933
Yeah, we get to drink

09:50.002 --> 09:52.162
and take out the trash.

Enjoy the rest
of your night.

09:53.803 --> 09:55.271

your fight tonight, huh?

10:12.088 --> 10:14.749
You think you're
a tough guy now?

10:14.823 --> 10:17.451
- Well, how about that rematch then?
- Let's do it.

10:17.526 --> 10:19.050
Now can we go in?

10:21.064 --> 10:23.896
l love it when
he does that.

10:31.406 --> 10:32.997
Look at this.

10:41.782 --> 10:43.647

10:56.328 --> 10:58.091
Hey, Pop,

10:58.164 --> 10:59.632
- Have a seat.
- Get up, get up.

11:02.602 --> 11:04.034
- Sit down.
- Good to see you, sir.

11:04.102 --> 11:05.570
- How are you?
- Good, thank you.

11:05.638 --> 11:07.468
Sit down.

11:07.538 --> 11:09.007
Look at--
you look amazing.

11:10.375 --> 11:12.936
This guy is the best
fighter l have ever seen.

11:13.012 --> 11:14.444
No, l mean it.

11:14.512 --> 11:16.503
l've known you--
l don't know

11:16.580 --> 11:18.707
how many years l've known you
and he has never...

11:18.783 --> 11:21.274
never asked me
for a favor

11:21.352 --> 11:23.875
or tried to strong-arm me
for anything.

11:23.955 --> 11:26.582
How old were you
when l first met you?

11:26.657 --> 11:29.785
- 17.
- 17. My God.

11:29.861 --> 11:31.886
You know why
l like you, Diego?

11:31.962 --> 11:35.625
Because you are
a fighter.

11:37.667 --> 11:40.262
Not like half these fuckin' pussies
that think they're fighters.

11:42.105 --> 11:45.132
You are a real fighter
in the true sense.

11:45.208 --> 11:47.109
Well, l couldn't have done it
without you, my friend.

11:48.811 --> 11:51.143
There's a lot you
can learn from him.

11:54.716 --> 11:56.150
lf there's anything
you need--

11:56.218 --> 11:58.311
anything-- you know
where to come.

11:58.386 --> 11:59.818
Huh?

11:59.888 --> 12:01.878
Thank you, sir.

12:03.758 --> 12:05.624

12:11.700 --> 12:13.462
Oh, look at the party.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.634
Let's hit that
dance floor, friends.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.505
All right.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.169
- Diego, you sure you don't want to come?
- Nah, you guys go.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.113
- l'm tired, man.
- All right.

12:49.367 --> 12:52.063
You don't feel like
dancing, Mr. Carter?

12:52.137 --> 12:54.127
No, not particularly, no.

12:54.205 --> 12:55.763
Well, that's okay.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.704
l can get your
attention in other ways.

13:07.819 --> 13:09.409
Oh my God.

13:09.486 --> 13:11.112
Who is that?

13:26.503 --> 13:27.560
Hold on.

13:30.472 --> 13:32.995
Just stay here.
I'll be right back.

14:15.279 --> 14:17.874
- What'll it be?
- Gin and tonic for me.

14:17.948 --> 14:19.745
What's your name?

14:19.818 --> 14:22.286

14:22.354 --> 14:24.048

You'll have
to follow me.

14:30.927 --> 14:32.588

on surprises.

l want to know

14:34.229 --> 14:37.632
- exactly where we're going.
- A fight, Mr. Diego.

14:37.701 --> 14:41.659
One that l guarantee
you have never seen before.

14:43.907 --> 14:45.704
Lead the way.

14:58.287 --> 15:00.846
Have a nice evening,
Mr. Carter.

15:03.891 --> 15:06.485
So what exactly
am l considering here?

15:06.560 --> 15:10.359
A tournament where
the best fighter fights

15:10.431 --> 15:12.695
for the ultimate prize.

15:12.767 --> 15:15.395
- And where are we going?
- Just follow the directions.

15:15.468 --> 15:17.493
lt changes every night.

15:26.445 --> 15:29.176
So how come l've never seen
you at the club before?

15:29.249 --> 15:31.114
It's not much further.

15:31.184 --> 15:33.118
How do l know you're not
some kind of sexy, blonde

15:33.185 --> 15:34.812
serial killer?

15:34.887 --> 15:36.911
Maybe l am.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.298
A little out
of the way, isn't it?

15:46.365 --> 15:49.129
We like to keep our
engagements exclusive.

16:31.172 --> 16:33.265
Hey, that's Bill West.

16:33.341 --> 16:35.138
He disappeared
from M.M.A. two years ago.

16:35.210 --> 16:37.301
You will find our
organization attracts

16:37.379 --> 16:39.779
some of the best fighters
in the world, Mr. Diego.

16:59.531 --> 17:02.295
Yeah! Yes!

17:04.837 --> 17:06.463
Are there
any rules here?

17:06.539 --> 17:08.665
There is one.

17:08.741 --> 17:10.265
And who might you be?

17:10.342 --> 17:11.933
Call me Seifer.

17:12.010 --> 17:14.002
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.944
- Seifer?
- Yes.

17:17.013 --> 17:19.311
You see, you not only
fight for survival,

17:19.383 --> 17:21.544
you fight for your
opponent's prize.

17:23.587 --> 17:26.078
They are consorts.
Every time a fighter fights

17:26.156 --> 17:29.149
he must put up
his consort as ante.

17:29.226 --> 17:30.658
lf you win,

17:30.728 --> 17:33.720
you get a night
with your enemy's consort.

17:33.798 --> 17:37.063
lf you lose,
he gets yours.

17:37.133 --> 17:38.725
You're kidding, right?

17:38.803 --> 17:42.465
No, no. This is unlike
anything you've ever seen.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.939
This place recreates

17:45.008 --> 17:47.203
the most ancient behavior--

17:47.275 --> 17:48.800
the fight for a mate.

17:50.013 --> 17:52.310
It's a primeval urge.

17:52.380 --> 17:53.780
Nothing is more powerful.

17:55.584 --> 17:57.176
The men go in hungry.

17:57.251 --> 17:58.843
They fight
to protect their mates

17:58.920 --> 18:01.013
and to claim
their enemy's.

18:01.090 --> 18:03.580
The fighting
you will see here--

18:03.658 --> 18:06.455
the most brutal thing
you will ever come across.

18:07.995 --> 18:11.556
l will give you $250,000
for your first fight.

18:12.666 --> 18:14.931
l make that
on a regular fight.

18:15.001 --> 18:17.526
Yes, but here
you have no taxes,

18:17.605 --> 18:20.266
no training, no agency,

18:20.340 --> 18:22.331
no management fees
to worry about.

18:22.408 --> 18:26.038
That makes it almost double
what you earn normally.

18:26.112 --> 18:28.103
Some men fight for glory.

18:28.180 --> 18:30.479
Some men fight for money.

18:30.549 --> 18:31.982
Money.

18:32.051 --> 18:33.915
Some men just fight to...

18:33.985 --> 18:36.784
satiate their bloodlust.

18:40.559 --> 18:42.855
lt is a hard choice.

18:42.927 --> 18:44.862
Yeah.

18:48.166 --> 18:51.363
Anyway, can l call you
or something?

18:51.435 --> 18:54.335
lf you're interested
in entering the tournament,

18:54.404 --> 18:56.100
you will earn
the right to a consort

18:56.173 --> 18:58.038
by fighting in
the preliminary round.

18:59.076 --> 19:02.534
lf l win, can l make you
my consort?

19:02.613 --> 19:04.409
l'm generally not
allowed to be considered.

19:06.183 --> 19:09.209
Well, ''generally not allowed''

19:09.285 --> 19:11.810
is not necessarily
''not allowed,'' so...

19:11.889 --> 19:13.821
I'll win this fight
and then we'll see what happens.

19:13.889 --> 19:15.323
Mr. Diego,

19:15.391 --> 19:17.187
you should be more concerned
about what would happen

19:17.259 --> 19:19.227
if you don't
win the fight.

19:19.294 --> 19:20.762
Yeah, right.

19:27.502 --> 19:30.232
That's Diego Carter.
ls he fighting tonight?

19:30.306 --> 19:31.737
Yeah. You bet.

19:31.806 --> 19:34.400
It's going off uneven odds
'cause he hasn't fought here.

19:34.475 --> 19:36.909
Oh, screw the odds.
l want a piece of that.

19:36.977 --> 19:38.638
Large piece on Carter.

19:38.712 --> 19:41.739
Hey, champ, what are you
doing here, slumming?

19:41.816 --> 19:44.248
Maybe he wants to see
what a real fight is like.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.479
Good luck.

20:02.870 --> 20:05.564
No rules, no referee.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.703
No belt will save you,
pretty boy.

20:27.058 --> 20:30.184
Welcome to bloodlust,
my friend.

20:38.767 --> 20:41.600
Oh! Yeah!

21:43.728 --> 21:46.323
Diego! Diego!

21:46.399 --> 21:49.026
- Diego! Diego!
- Yeah!

21:50.901 --> 21:52.926
He's good.

21:53.004 --> 21:55.905
- Sloppy.
- Right now he is.

21:55.973 --> 21:59.740
But did you see it? The point
where he let his rage take over?

22:00.777 --> 22:02.905
Just imagine
what we might see

22:02.979 --> 22:05.743
if we set the other
fighters loose on him.

22:09.752 --> 22:12.745
Diego! Diego!

22:12.823 --> 22:16.656
Diego! Diego!
Diego! Diego!

22:27.470 --> 22:29.732
Mr. Carter...

22:29.805 --> 22:33.262
we are honored that you have
blessed us with your presence.

22:33.341 --> 22:37.175
Congratulations on
a beautifully-fought match.

22:37.245 --> 22:39.372
- Thanks.
- You have earned a place

22:39.447 --> 22:42.473
in this tournament
and a right to a consort.

22:42.551 --> 22:45.179
Please... make your choice.

22:52.359 --> 22:54.884
They're all very
beautiful ladies.

22:54.962 --> 22:57.987
But l'm afraid for me
there's only one choice--

22:58.063 --> 22:59.997
her.

23:01.367 --> 23:02.802
Mr. Carter,

23:02.869 --> 23:04.302
l am afraid that Sandra

23:04.371 --> 23:06.304
is my personal assistant
and is therefore

23:06.372 --> 23:09.306
unavailable
as a consort.

23:09.375 --> 23:12.470
l thought you offered me
the woman of my choice.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.278
Very well, Mr. Carter.

23:18.349 --> 23:20.748
Sandra is
your new consort.

23:20.818 --> 23:24.151
Let us hope that you have
a long and promising career.

23:24.221 --> 23:25.915
Thanks again.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.161
So you're mine.

23:40.237 --> 23:42.329
This is your place?

23:42.405 --> 23:46.239
No. This is your place.

23:46.307 --> 23:47.776
Mine?

23:53.149 --> 23:55.275
Welcome to your
new home, Mr. Diego.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.819
- This is a mansion.
- You're very observant.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.757
Your breakfast
is ready, sir.

26:09.375 --> 26:12.139
They call him Crusher.

26:12.211 --> 26:15.305
His real name
is lgor Kurkovich.

26:15.380 --> 26:17.679
He was a former officer
in the Serbian military.

26:19.318 --> 26:22.808
Crusher was discharged from service
for alleged war crimes,

26:22.887 --> 26:24.751
but no charges formally
brought against him.

26:24.823 --> 26:27.517
He entered M.M.A.
shortly afterwards

26:27.592 --> 26:31.254
and rapidly became one of the most
dangerous fighters in the Eastern world.

26:31.329 --> 26:34.023
The problem was
Crusher's style

26:34.097 --> 26:36.726
was too brutal
for the national venues.

26:36.800 --> 26:40.463
None of the major organizations
were willing to grant him a license.

26:40.537 --> 26:42.470
That is, until reigning

26:42.539 --> 26:45.302
U.S. champion Danny Jones

26:45.374 --> 26:47.534
granted Crusher
a title shot.

26:47.610 --> 26:49.875
lt only took him 28 seconds.

26:49.946 --> 26:52.313
Danny was never able
to fight again.

26:53.682 --> 26:56.311
These guys
are animals, Diego.

26:56.384 --> 26:58.977
They'll get up every time
you knock them down.

26:59.055 --> 27:00.954
It's not a sport to them.

27:01.022 --> 27:02.512
It's life or death.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.759
Sounds like fun.

27:06.827 --> 27:09.057
Then maybe
we should get to work.

27:10.197 --> 27:11.994
Let's get to work.

28:20.562 --> 28:23.087
Hey, this is Diego.
Leave me a message

28:23.164 --> 28:25.428
or I'll choke you out.

28:25.499 --> 28:27.969
Diego, this is George.

28:28.037 --> 28:29.231
Where the hell
have you been, bro?

28:29.303 --> 28:32.170
You doing okay?

28:32.239 --> 28:34.435
Call me, huh?

28:35.744 --> 28:39.235
Hey, take it easy,
Diego, okay?

28:44.918 --> 28:48.115
Welcome to The Tournament.
Place your bets.

29:48.211 --> 29:50.643
The visitor hours are over.

29:50.712 --> 29:53.739
- l'm here to see Diego--
- Visitor hours are over!

29:53.816 --> 29:57.581
Listen, l don't want
any trouble, okay?

30:48.433 --> 30:50.229
Diego has a visitor.

31:01.578 --> 31:04.707
George, what the hell
are you doing here?

31:04.781 --> 31:07.409
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Fighting. Why?

31:07.485 --> 31:09.508
Why? Because you
disappeared off the map.

31:09.586 --> 31:12.521
And then l find out
from some shady people

31:12.590 --> 31:15.557
that you're fighting in an underground
illegal tournament.

31:15.624 --> 31:18.752
Look, l know what
l'm doing, okay?

31:18.828 --> 31:21.126
lt wasn't exactly easy
to get in here, Diego.

31:21.196 --> 31:23.791
You really want to associate
yourself with this?

31:23.866 --> 31:26.698
- How about we both get out of here?
- No can do, brother.

31:27.969 --> 31:29.460
Look, George,

31:29.537 --> 31:33.406
for the first time in my life
l feel like things fit.

31:33.474 --> 31:36.237
There's no bullshit
here, brother--

31:36.311 --> 31:39.371
no managers, no P.R.,
no reporters.

31:40.548 --> 31:43.346
Trust me, this is
a whole new league.

31:43.418 --> 31:46.944
Yeah? That doesn't
make it any good.

31:47.019 --> 31:50.046
But you know what?
lf you already made up your mind,

31:50.123 --> 31:52.716
l got better things to do
than to argue with you.

31:52.793 --> 31:55.090
l'm only a phone call away
if you ever need me.

31:55.161 --> 31:57.254
- Got it?
- Go it, bro.

32:02.700 --> 32:04.761
Place your bets.

32:07.540 --> 32:11.373
Diego, l will crush you
like a little bug.

32:11.444 --> 32:13.810
And when l squeeze
the life out of you,

32:13.880 --> 32:16.039
people can pick
you up in pieces.

32:18.116 --> 32:21.709
Diego, I'll see you
in the cage.

32:21.785 --> 32:24.516
l've been training
very hard for this.

32:24.588 --> 32:26.522
We'll see who's
the best fighter.

32:36.699 --> 32:39.190
Crusher versus Carter,

32:43.740 --> 32:45.765
Come on,
put 'em up, Diego!

33:18.906 --> 33:21.965
- Come on, fight!
- This is a different kind of a fight

33:22.041 --> 33:26.036
for your man.
l wonder if he will adapt.

33:27.947 --> 33:31.678
l have seen fighters get really hurt
from this if they weren't prepared.

33:31.751 --> 33:34.618
He doesn't seem to be
too prepared from what l see.

33:34.687 --> 33:37.019
Keep looking.

34:32.340 --> 34:34.571
What exactly is your plan
for him, if l may ask?

34:34.641 --> 34:36.768
lt will be fun to see
how far he goes.

34:36.846 --> 34:39.404
Fun?

34:39.478 --> 34:41.743
Yes, like in the movie!

34:41.815 --> 34:43.782
Will he go
to the dark side?

34:43.851 --> 34:46.216
Besides, why do you care
what happens to him?

34:46.286 --> 34:48.914
l don't.

35:39.235 --> 35:41.932
Diego, Diego, Diego!

35:42.006 --> 35:43.939
Diego, Diego!

36:02.290 --> 36:04.622
Congratulations,
Mr. Diego.

36:04.692 --> 36:06.660
Well, l couldn't have
done it without you.

36:06.728 --> 36:09.354
And you're right--
this is something else.

36:10.933 --> 36:12.762
What's next?

36:17.404 --> 36:19.429
You gotta be kidding.

36:19.505 --> 36:23.806
You won. You get your prize--
that's the rule.

36:23.876 --> 36:26.937
- Maybe you and--
- Go enjoy your prize.

36:27.013 --> 36:29.173
I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.223
- Hi.
- Hi there, gorgeous.

37:21.062 --> 37:23.657
Are you ready for this?

37:23.733 --> 37:26.325
l know what you want.

38:44.907 --> 38:50.345
* There must something,
sworn to tear me down *

38:51.680 --> 38:54.410
* Oh yeah *

38:54.482 --> 38:56.814
* My pain is building *

38:56.885 --> 39:00.320
* Tearing me inside out *

39:00.388 --> 39:02.619
* Oh yeah *

39:04.492 --> 39:06.426
* Will l finish
last again? *

39:06.494 --> 39:09.088
* Here l wait
for this to end *

39:09.164 --> 39:12.690
* l forced the pain
l struggle with *

39:12.768 --> 39:16.861
* And l am open to you. *

39:40.660 --> 39:42.992
Sandra, is that you?

39:45.364 --> 39:47.796
- Who the fuck are you?
- Diego Carter, right?

39:47.865 --> 39:49.595
Name's Stone.
Sandra sent me.

39:56.740 --> 39:58.675
Yeah, my mansion's bigger.

39:58.743 --> 40:01.301
You fight enough fights,
you get a bigger mansion.

40:01.377 --> 40:04.371
- You are in the tournament too?
- l am in the tournament.

40:04.448 --> 40:06.177
Like l said,
Sandra sent me here.

40:10.019 --> 40:12.509
l see you two
have already met.

40:15.658 --> 40:17.591
l'm here to train you
if you'll listen.

40:17.659 --> 40:20.423
l know your opponent Marco--
he's a badass.

40:20.496 --> 40:22.861
l recognize you.

40:22.931 --> 40:26.297
You're the world cage
champion, five years ago.

40:26.368 --> 40:27.698
Mmm, six.

40:27.768 --> 40:30.567
What happened to you?
All of a sudden, you disappeared.

40:30.639 --> 40:32.936
l guess l needed
a change of setting.

40:34.943 --> 40:37.137
All right.

40:49.990 --> 40:52.082
You fight hard,
but you need to fight smart.

40:52.159 --> 40:53.626
Feel his next move.

41:35.132 --> 41:37.726
- Capoeira?
- Yes, tough to beat--

41:37.800 --> 41:39.428
unless l teach you.

41:53.114 --> 41:55.947
Nice moves, Diego,
but l don't go down that easily.

41:58.854 --> 42:01.720
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

42:01.790 --> 42:04.988
So what do you think?
Are you going to hang around for a while?

42:05.060 --> 42:07.458
The tournament?
Heh. Sure.

42:07.528 --> 42:10.089
This could affect your standings
in the more legitimate fights.

42:10.166 --> 42:11.995
Who cares?

42:12.065 --> 42:15.000
There's more money here anyway,
plus the perks.

42:15.068 --> 42:17.831
Yeah, the money,
the women, the fights--

42:17.906 --> 42:21.101
they set it all up
to attract guys like us.

42:21.174 --> 42:22.765
But there's
a downside, Diego.

42:22.842 --> 42:24.433
People get hurt here--
really hurt.

42:24.510 --> 42:26.535
l won't get hurt.

42:26.612 --> 42:30.048
l don't see an ''S'' on your chest.
Everybody gets hurt.

42:30.116 --> 42:32.016
Cheers to that,
my friend.

42:45.930 --> 42:48.331
Tell me something.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.562
Monique is
Stone's consort, right?

42:50.635 --> 42:53.067
Yes.

42:53.136 --> 42:56.163
They seem to have something
special between them.

42:56.241 --> 42:59.367
They do.

42:59.443 --> 43:01.934
Stone has been doing this
for a long time,

43:02.012 --> 43:05.004
and Monique has been doing it
with him for a lot of it.

43:05.082 --> 43:08.516
It's weird to see two people
that really care for each other

43:08.585 --> 43:10.018
in a place like this.

43:10.086 --> 43:11.519
ln Russia they say that

43:11.588 --> 43:14.419
even on the battlefield
a rose can bloom.

43:14.490 --> 43:17.391
That's what
l love about you.

43:17.461 --> 43:20.293
lt doesn't matter.

43:20.363 --> 43:23.331
You need to forget about everything
except your next fight.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.830
The problem is

43:26.902 --> 43:30.599
there are some very powerful
distractions here.

43:35.510 --> 43:39.673
You are about
to see something awesome.

43:39.746 --> 43:42.182
Tonight,
a very special event.

43:42.250 --> 43:45.082
Welcome to the tournament.

43:46.554 --> 43:48.282
This is real fighting.

43:48.356 --> 43:49.946
This ain't
no M.M.A. bullshit.

43:50.024 --> 43:53.117
l'm undefeated. l got some
surprises for you in the ring--

43:53.193 --> 43:55.594
shit you've never
seen before.

43:55.662 --> 43:58.597
l'm gonna come in there
and fuck you up.

44:00.365 --> 44:04.166
l grew up in the streets
of South America.

44:04.235 --> 44:07.171
l've been fighting
since l'm 1 2.

44:07.239 --> 44:11.505
l have more than 100 fight on the street
and l never lost a street fight.

44:11.576 --> 44:14.204
And l never will,
so let's just get in the cage

44:14.280 --> 44:16.214
and see who's the best.

44:16.281 --> 44:17.612
Let's do that.

44:25.155 --> 44:27.623
Carter versus Marco.

45:12.232 --> 45:13.700
Looks like our man's
doing all right.

45:48.734 --> 45:51.600
What's going on?
What happened to Diego's advantage?

45:51.668 --> 45:53.967
Hmm, looks like Marco
picked up some new tricks.

47:19.684 --> 47:21.276
Good job, bro.

47:24.255 --> 47:27.782
My man!
Taking care of business.

47:27.858 --> 47:29.917
l couldn't have done it
without your help, my friend.

47:29.993 --> 47:32.427
No charge.
We've gotta party, amigo.

47:32.495 --> 47:34.464
You gotta be kidding me.
l can hardly move.

47:34.530 --> 47:36.191
Come on, Diego--
a nice hot tub,

47:36.265 --> 47:38.256
some champagne
and beautiful women?

47:38.335 --> 47:40.929
That settles it! Last one to the pool
has to wear their bathing suit.

47:41.003 --> 47:44.598
- All right.
- And don't forget your prize, buddy.

48:34.253 --> 48:37.689
l don't suppose this falls
under your job description?

48:40.459 --> 48:43.053
Looks like we need some more
champagne. Come on.

48:53.271 --> 48:55.431
Hey, Stone,

48:55.507 --> 48:58.564
which one was the best consort
you ever had?

48:58.642 --> 49:01.475
l don't want one.
l got Monique.

49:01.545 --> 49:03.810
- That's all l need.
- Come on, man.

49:03.880 --> 49:07.408
lf she doesn't care,
why should you?

49:08.885 --> 49:10.785
Because l do,
that's why.

49:12.288 --> 49:14.449
Before Monique,
fighting was everything.

49:14.523 --> 49:16.388
She saved me.

49:17.759 --> 49:19.353
You go fight, Diego,

49:19.429 --> 49:21.691
just make sure you don't
lose yourself along the way.

49:21.763 --> 49:24.699
Thanks, Stone.
Let's go get some drinks.

49:24.767 --> 49:26.428
Sounds good to me.

49:30.672 --> 49:33.435
You better watch out, Diego.
l could have had you right there, bro.

49:33.507 --> 49:35.271
l tap out.

49:37.010 --> 49:39.808
Hey, man, we're gonna head on out
to the casa. You cool?

49:39.882 --> 49:41.973
- l'm good.
- And good luck on your next fight.

49:42.050 --> 49:44.074
Sandra's a good girl.
She'll take good care of you.

49:44.151 --> 49:46.143
Thanks, guys.

50:08.608 --> 50:11.633
- It's about time you got back.
- What are you doing here?

50:11.710 --> 50:13.540
- Where's Sandra?
- She took the night off.

50:21.986 --> 50:24.716
Look, l can't
do this tonight.

50:24.788 --> 50:27.882
Oh, l see.

50:27.958 --> 50:30.426
Well, l can help you
with that.

50:57.919 --> 51:01.184
Looks like our guy
is having fun.

51:03.926 --> 51:06.121
You don't understand.

51:06.193 --> 51:09.219
You don't have to do
anything tonight.

51:12.867 --> 51:14.858
Okay.

51:14.935 --> 51:18.496
l mean, if you
don't like me--

51:18.571 --> 51:19.833
l like you fine.

51:19.907 --> 51:23.434
You're very beautiful.
It's just that something easy

51:23.510 --> 51:25.570
is not that exciting.

51:25.646 --> 51:28.375
Well, all the girls
are easy here, Diego.

51:28.448 --> 51:31.077
- That's the point.
- lt doesn't have to be that way.

51:32.819 --> 51:37.050
The fighters are here because
of the money generated by the fights.

51:38.457 --> 51:40.722
The women are here
to keep the fighters happy--

51:40.793 --> 51:42.852
it has to be easy.

51:42.928 --> 51:45.988
We're brought here
to work, Diego.

51:46.065 --> 51:49.591
And there's no work except
for the type we do at the tournaments.

51:49.667 --> 51:51.794
And the people
who run it...

51:51.870 --> 51:53.928
don't take no
for an answer.

52:06.917 --> 52:10.682
You're not doing me any favors
by not sleeping with me tonight, Diego.

52:10.753 --> 52:12.722
Because tomorrow night...

52:12.789 --> 52:15.451
l will be given away
or kept.

52:15.524 --> 52:17.186
There must be
something l can do.

52:17.260 --> 52:19.989
There are too many people
making too much money off the fights.

52:20.062 --> 52:21.619
lf you tried anything...

52:21.697 --> 52:23.392
they'd kill you.

52:23.465 --> 52:25.729
Then they'd kill half
of the other girls

52:25.800 --> 52:27.462
to teach us all
a lesson.

52:27.535 --> 52:30.504
Our best hope is that maybe
when the tournament is over,

52:30.572 --> 52:33.166
they'll let us go.

52:33.240 --> 52:36.677
- That's a long shot.
- It's all we have.

52:36.744 --> 52:40.111
- ls Sandra in the same way?
- She has it even worse, Diego.

52:40.181 --> 52:42.944
She belongs to Seifer.

52:44.385 --> 52:46.853
She has to be at the beck
and call of that devil.

52:46.921 --> 52:48.910
Seifer?

52:48.989 --> 52:51.424
Tell me about him.

52:56.195 --> 52:59.563
He grew up
on the streets of Russia.

52:59.631 --> 53:02.499
And he was sent to prison
when he was a teenager.

53:02.567 --> 53:05.002
That's where he
started fighting.

53:05.071 --> 53:07.403
Rumor has it he killed
several men in the ring.

53:09.508 --> 53:12.842
After that, he escaped
and fled here to America.

53:12.912 --> 53:15.038
lt was his idea to combine
the prostitution rings

53:15.112 --> 53:17.172
and the underground
tournaments.

53:18.848 --> 53:22.115
l can't imagine what kind
of monster could be so cruel.

53:28.692 --> 53:30.852
What are you doing?

53:30.928 --> 53:32.987
You seem down,
my darling.

53:33.064 --> 53:35.897
ls something
the matter?

53:35.964 --> 53:39.231
- What do you care?
- Aw.

53:39.303 --> 53:42.271
You really care
about that fool, don't you?

53:42.338 --> 53:46.239
He sleeps with every woman
that comes his way.

53:51.779 --> 53:54.715
You really have
feelings for that?

53:56.785 --> 53:59.844
Are you jealous, Seifer? l thought
you were a bigger man than that.

54:00.888 --> 54:02.584
Yeah.

54:02.658 --> 54:04.592
I'll be glad to be
rid of him when l leave.

54:04.658 --> 54:07.857
- Leave?
- My turn's up next fight, Seifer.

54:07.929 --> 54:10.692
- Ah, yeah.
- l'm getting as far away from this place

54:10.765 --> 54:13.029
- as l can.
- Do you think you can leave?!

54:13.101 --> 54:15.899
l've done my time
according to the rules.

54:15.969 --> 54:18.402
Oh, there are no rules!

54:18.473 --> 54:20.872
Only what l decide.

54:20.941 --> 54:24.433
And if anyone disobeys me,

54:24.511 --> 54:27.206
including your little friend,

54:27.280 --> 54:29.874
l will crush him.

54:29.949 --> 54:32.748
You will not
leave here ever.

54:32.819 --> 54:34.979
You belong to me.

54:35.054 --> 54:37.114
Your friend belongs to me

54:37.188 --> 54:39.486
and l will turn him
into an animal

54:39.558 --> 54:41.252
before your eyes
because l can.

54:41.325 --> 54:45.786
Oh yes,
you will watch

54:45.864 --> 54:48.856
as his nobility
gets replaced

54:48.933 --> 54:50.695
with bloodlust.

55:35.076 --> 55:37.042
Where are you going?

55:37.112 --> 55:39.579
This is not the way
to your room.

55:41.415 --> 55:43.178
l was--

55:43.251 --> 55:46.014
l haven't broken
any rules.

55:46.085 --> 55:48.018
Oh, but you have,
Marcela.

55:48.088 --> 55:49.851
You broke
the primary rule--

55:49.923 --> 55:53.382
you did not sleep
with the winner of the fight.

55:53.460 --> 55:55.017
He said he wasn't
interested.

55:55.095 --> 55:57.961
He said l didn't--
l didn't have to.

55:58.030 --> 56:01.363
Then you convince him,

56:01.434 --> 56:03.527
you little slut.

56:03.603 --> 56:06.127
Please don't hurt me,
please.

56:06.205 --> 56:09.140
l'm afraid, Marcela,
that you might inspire

56:09.208 --> 56:10.971
the other girls
to insubordination.

56:11.042 --> 56:12.907
No, l promise.

56:12.976 --> 56:15.947
l'm going to take this
as a very serious matter.

56:16.013 --> 56:17.878
No, please.
No, please.

56:17.948 --> 56:20.248
Seifer, please.
l promise.

56:20.319 --> 56:22.945
- l promise I'll go back. Please please.
- Kiss me on the cheek.

56:24.488 --> 56:26.580
Please don't.
Please don't.

56:41.371 --> 56:43.838
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

56:43.908 --> 56:46.808
Hey, Diego man,
where have you been, bro?

56:46.875 --> 56:48.399
Dawg, you had
everyone worried.

56:48.478 --> 56:50.945
So nice
to see you guys.

56:51.014 --> 56:53.005
Come on,
let's take a walk.

56:56.150 --> 56:58.084
- Wow.
- Jeez.

56:58.153 --> 57:01.246
So, Diego man,
are you okay?

57:01.322 --> 57:03.255
Am l okay?

57:03.324 --> 57:06.487
Are you guys ready to party?
That's the question.

57:06.561 --> 57:08.858
What's wrong?
Normally l mention a party

57:08.929 --> 57:10.864
and you guys
jump through the roof.

57:10.932 --> 57:12.626
ls your dad okay?

57:12.700 --> 57:14.292
Yeah. No, he's fine.
It's not that.

57:14.368 --> 57:16.165
So then what is it?

57:16.236 --> 57:18.864
Diego, no one has seen
or heard from you in three months.

57:18.938 --> 57:21.839
And then we find out you're
staying in this expensive place

57:21.907 --> 57:24.400
with some nasty-looking
motherfuckers guarding it.

57:26.579 --> 57:29.981
- Who did?
- My dad found you.

57:30.049 --> 57:32.142
And he had to call in
a lot of favors to do it, man.

57:32.218 --> 57:35.209
Look, this is some heavy shit
you got yourself involved in, Diego.

57:35.288 --> 57:36.846
We just want
to help out, man.

57:36.922 --> 57:38.855
Look, l understand
your concern, okay?

57:38.923 --> 57:41.290
This is just a different
kind of tournament.

57:41.359 --> 57:43.486
Yeah, an illegal kind.

57:50.769 --> 57:53.066
l'm just fighting,

57:53.138 --> 57:55.072
like before.

57:55.139 --> 57:57.165
Now come on,
let's go.

57:58.542 --> 58:00.908
All right, then we'll
just hang around

58:00.979 --> 58:02.912
for moral support,
just like before.

58:02.979 --> 58:05.073
No, not this time.

58:05.149 --> 58:08.743
l'm on my own.

58:08.819 --> 58:11.479
You guys got to
trust me, okay?

58:11.555 --> 58:13.748
Everything's
gonna be fine.

58:13.822 --> 58:16.622
Next week
we're gonna have fun.

58:16.693 --> 58:18.957
Drinks are on me.

58:19.028 --> 58:21.826
This is my fight

58:21.897 --> 58:26.358
and l gotta finish it
my way.

58:26.436 --> 58:28.370
Trust me.

58:28.438 --> 58:30.463
All right.

58:32.941 --> 58:34.875
They are consorts.

58:34.942 --> 58:38.877
Every time a fighter fights,
he must put up his consort as ante.

58:38.946 --> 58:43.348
lf you win, you get a night
with your enemy's consort.

58:43.417 --> 58:47.443
lf you lose,
he gets yours.

59:36.901 --> 59:40.266
l trust you had a good time
with Marcela.

59:40.337 --> 59:42.168
l thought
that was the idea.

59:42.238 --> 59:45.229
We didn't do anything, okay?
We just talked.

01:00:01.123 --> 01:00:04.613
She explained to me
why all these girls are here.

01:00:04.692 --> 01:00:06.956
What do you care?

01:00:09.296 --> 01:00:11.231
l care.

01:00:11.299 --> 01:00:13.266
l care about them,

01:00:13.333 --> 01:00:15.563
and especially
l care about you.

01:00:15.635 --> 01:00:17.934
There's nothing
worth caring for.

01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:27.671
Don't say that.

01:00:27.747 --> 01:00:30.078
l've been
selling my body

01:00:30.149 --> 01:00:34.518
since l was
a little girl, Diego.

01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:37.282
ls that the type of woman
you really want to be with?

01:00:37.356 --> 01:00:40.120
You had no choice.
lt wasn't your fault.

01:00:42.861 --> 01:00:44.794
And yes,

01:00:44.863 --> 01:00:48.196
you are the woman
l want to be with.

01:00:48.267 --> 01:00:52.702
This is the way Seifer wants you
to feel about yourself.

01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:55.569
That's his control.

01:00:55.639 --> 01:00:58.437
He twisted you
so you can't see the truth.

01:00:58.509 --> 01:01:01.306
We've both been tricked
into being here.

01:01:01.378 --> 01:01:03.709
But now l know
what's going on

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.372
and l can do
something about it.

01:01:05.448 --> 01:01:07.109
Can l help?

01:01:07.184 --> 01:01:11.414
l'm counting on you.
l mean,

01:01:11.488 --> 01:01:15.254
look what happened to this place
when you left me alone.

01:02:48.812 --> 01:02:49.946
* l can't imagine
not waking up next to you *

01:02:49.946 --> 01:02:52.073
* l can't imagine
not waking up next to you *

01:02:52.147 --> 01:02:55.845
* l'm gonna crawl in bed,
never leave this view *

01:02:55.918 --> 01:02:58.977
* Of you, l said *

01:03:01.288 --> 01:03:05.054
* Do you remember when
we would talk all night? *

01:03:05.126 --> 01:03:08.061
* Sleep less just to watch
the dark turn light *

01:03:08.129 --> 01:03:11.996
* l do, you said *

01:03:12.065 --> 01:03:14.534
* lf l say too much *

01:03:14.602 --> 01:03:16.069
* Don't say enough *

01:03:16.135 --> 01:03:19.334
* lf l wait too long
to admit l'm wrong *

01:03:19.406 --> 01:03:22.465
* lf l let you down
time and again *

01:03:22.542 --> 01:03:29.209
* Just know that
I'll be here for you *

01:03:29.281 --> 01:03:32.512
* 'Cause l believe *

01:03:32.585 --> 01:03:35.280
* Even when things
go wrong *

01:03:35.354 --> 01:03:38.484
* 'Cause l believe *

01:03:38.558 --> 01:03:41.651
* Even when
l'm not strong *

01:03:41.726 --> 01:03:44.594
* 'Cause l believe. *

01:03:44.663 --> 01:03:46.630
l was thinking,
Diego--

01:03:46.697 --> 01:03:49.029
if we were to just
leave, sneak away...

01:03:49.101 --> 01:03:51.864
You have contacts
that could help us.

01:03:51.937 --> 01:03:54.804
l can't do that,
Sandra,

01:03:54.872 --> 01:03:57.568
not with
what l know now.

01:03:57.642 --> 01:04:01.078
Besides, sneaking away
is not my style.

01:04:01.144 --> 01:04:03.077
We'll go to
the tournament tonight.

01:04:03.147 --> 01:04:06.081
I'll have a word with Seifer.
We'll see what happens.

01:04:06.149 --> 01:04:08.583
What happens is
he'll make you fight.

01:04:08.653 --> 01:04:10.313
Fine.

01:04:10.387 --> 01:04:12.946
l finally found something
worth fighting for.

01:04:13.023 --> 01:04:14.887
l hope you're right.

01:04:14.959 --> 01:04:19.418
l'm always right,
baby.

01:04:19.496 --> 01:04:21.258
* When you step
on a man *

01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:24.061
* You done crossed
his path *

01:04:24.134 --> 01:04:30.435
* l'm not sure
if anyone will know *

01:04:30.505 --> 01:04:34.498
* How we go, how we go,
how we go. *

01:04:42.949 --> 01:04:45.043
Seifer versus Stone.

01:04:51.557 --> 01:04:53.684
Sandra, why are
Seifer and Stone in the ring?

01:05:01.233 --> 01:05:02.961
Monique, why is Stone
in the ring with Seifer?

01:05:03.035 --> 01:05:05.731
l tried to convince Stone.
He won't listen to me.

01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:13.838
There is a way out, Diego,
and it's through Seifer.

01:05:13.913 --> 01:05:17.313
Stone can beat this guy.
Come on, Stone!

01:05:59.788 --> 01:06:02.951
l can't believe it.
Come on, Stone, you can do it!

01:06:22.842 --> 01:06:24.776
Bloodlust!

01:06:24.845 --> 01:06:27.835
Bloodlust!
Bloodlust!

01:06:27.913 --> 01:06:32.374
Bloodlust! Bloodlust!
Bloodlust!

01:06:32.451 --> 01:06:35.387
Bloodlust!

01:06:43.629 --> 01:06:45.255
Russian!

01:07:03.181 --> 01:07:06.378
You have not yet
earned the right

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:08.246
to fight me,
Mr. Carter.

01:07:08.317 --> 01:07:10.617
You have to fight
a few more rounds

01:07:10.688 --> 01:07:12.745
and win to get
that privilege.

01:07:12.823 --> 01:07:15.815
l don't play
by your rules.

01:07:15.892 --> 01:07:18.554
l'm taking Sandra
and Monique out of here.

01:07:18.628 --> 01:07:21.892
You want to rescue
the ladies, be a hero?

01:07:21.965 --> 01:07:24.158
Then stay and fight.

01:07:24.233 --> 01:07:27.134
lf you win your matches,
you get a shot at me--

01:07:27.203 --> 01:07:29.762
just what you
always wanted.

01:07:32.807 --> 01:07:35.070
Oh, Diego.
Oh, Diego.

01:07:35.143 --> 01:07:36.974
Oh, Diego.

01:07:37.045 --> 01:07:40.343
lf you do not want
to fight

01:07:40.414 --> 01:07:42.109
then l will
let you leave,

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:43.979
but the ladies stay

01:07:44.051 --> 01:07:46.986
and they will pay for the trouble
you have cost me.

01:07:47.055 --> 01:07:49.418
Their only chance
of getting out

01:07:49.489 --> 01:07:52.754
is if you come back
and fight.

01:07:52.826 --> 01:07:54.657
Sandra!

01:08:53.482 --> 01:08:57.919
You know l did not want it
to be this way.

01:09:02.957 --> 01:09:05.015
Did you hear me?

01:09:05.091 --> 01:09:07.993
l never wanted it
to be this way.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.995
l never wanted

01:09:10.064 --> 01:09:12.693
to have you held
against your will.

01:09:12.767 --> 01:09:16.224
l wanted you to have much more
than the other girls--

01:09:16.303 --> 01:09:18.932
a chance
to be with me,

01:09:19.006 --> 01:09:21.701
to rule with me.

01:09:26.112 --> 01:09:28.046
Where's Monique?

01:09:28.113 --> 01:09:30.548
l have not yet decided
what l will do with her.

01:09:30.617 --> 01:09:32.777
Maybe I'll put her back
in the rotation.

01:09:32.852 --> 01:09:35.011
Maybe I'll put her
with the sickest

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:37.578
son-of-a-bitch fighter
l know.

01:09:37.657 --> 01:09:40.886
Maybe I'll put her back
on the streets where l found her

01:09:40.959 --> 01:09:43.326
until she learns
some respect.

01:09:45.497 --> 01:09:47.930
Maybe I'll just
kill her.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.661
Maybe you too.

01:10:00.176 --> 01:10:02.111
All the money
and power--

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.273
you're still
a fucking nobody.

01:10:04.348 --> 01:10:07.077
You know what?
I'll tell you this--

01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:09.549
you enjoy the last thought
you have of him,

01:10:09.619 --> 01:10:13.611
because l will rip Diego
to shreds.

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:17.591
And l will save
a little piece for you.

01:10:26.634 --> 01:10:28.626
Goodbye.

01:10:47.553 --> 01:10:50.421
l don't have time
for you.

01:10:50.491 --> 01:10:52.823
But l do.

01:13:41.649 --> 01:13:43.947
Hey, Pop, we found Diego.
What do you want us to do?

01:13:44.018 --> 01:13:46.008
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

01:13:46.087 --> 01:13:47.609
- Listen to me.
- l'm listening.

01:13:47.687 --> 01:13:49.747
l want you to get
over there right now.

01:13:49.823 --> 01:13:51.723
All right.

01:14:05.772 --> 01:14:08.365
You too much of a pussy
to fight me?

01:14:08.439 --> 01:14:11.137
l told you before--

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:13.144
you have to prove
yourself in the ring

01:14:13.212 --> 01:14:16.545
before you have
the honor of fighting me.

01:14:16.615 --> 01:14:19.277
l can beat up anybody.

01:14:19.351 --> 01:14:22.285
l have no doubt you will win
against your opponents.

01:14:22.353 --> 01:14:24.844
What l am interested in
is seeing

01:14:24.922 --> 01:14:26.720
how much of you
is left afterwards.

01:14:59.887 --> 01:15:03.414
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

01:15:10.899 --> 01:15:14.925
Good job, Mr. Carter.

01:15:15.003 --> 01:15:18.164
At last l've found
a worthy opponent.

01:15:18.239 --> 01:15:20.968
lt will be an honor
to fight you.

01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:22.871
You know nothing
of honor.

01:15:22.943 --> 01:15:25.308
And l came here

01:15:25.378 --> 01:15:27.642
to destroy you

01:15:27.713 --> 01:15:29.806
and everything
you represent.

01:15:29.881 --> 01:15:31.748
Bold words, Diego.

01:15:31.818 --> 01:15:34.149
Let us see if you
speak so eloquently

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.710
as l break
your spine.

01:16:00.843 --> 01:16:02.243
Yes.

01:16:04.282 --> 01:16:05.475
No.

01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:30.960
l thought
you were worthy.

01:16:33.141 --> 01:16:35.074
lt is a shame.

01:16:35.143 --> 01:16:37.371
lf you had done
what l asked

01:16:37.446 --> 01:16:39.379
you would have had
everything.

01:16:39.446 --> 01:16:41.711
Now you will have
nothing--

01:16:41.782 --> 01:16:44.614
not even your life.

01:17:29.559 --> 01:17:32.051
- Freeze, asshole. Stop it right there.
- You, stop it.

01:17:36.199 --> 01:17:38.430
You will have to
learn, Diego--

01:17:38.502 --> 01:17:41.959
no matter how great
a fighter you are,

01:17:42.037 --> 01:17:44.871
you cannot beat God.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:48.376
l brought some friends,
asshole.

01:18:19.373 --> 01:18:21.364
My God,
you're beautiful.

01:18:21.442 --> 01:18:23.672
You'll have to forgive him.
He was raised in the woods.

01:18:23.744 --> 01:18:25.711
- Who are you guys?
- We're friends of Diego.

01:18:25.779 --> 01:18:27.837
We're gonna get you guys
out of here. Come on.

01:18:39.592 --> 01:18:41.582
Get going.

01:18:50.668 --> 01:18:52.499
- You guys all right? You all right?
- Yeah.

01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:54.231
She needs to go
to the hospital.

01:18:54.306 --> 01:18:56.865
I'll take her.

01:18:56.941 --> 01:18:59.239
- Let's go.
- Let's go, guys.

01:19:04.181 --> 01:19:05.648
Get the hell in here.

01:19:10.452 --> 01:19:13.286
Close that door.
Jeez.

01:19:13.357 --> 01:19:16.449
Nice fight, Diego.

01:19:16.526 --> 01:19:18.517
Can we go
to the club now?

01:19:18.595 --> 01:19:20.893
Hell yeah. We all need a drink
after this night.

01:19:20.964 --> 01:19:22.897
Oh, hell yeah.

01:19:22.964 --> 01:19:25.662
Shut up!

01:19:28.204 --> 01:19:31.831
You know you almost
gave me a heart attack?

01:19:39.347 --> 01:19:40.837
Eddie, let's go.

01:20:10.008 --> 01:20:13.569
* ...That's worth fighting for *

01:20:13.645 --> 01:20:16.944
* Got the wind
knocked out of you *

01:20:17.015 --> 01:20:20.610
* Don't let go *

01:20:20.685 --> 01:20:23.780
* When they think
they got you *

01:20:23.855 --> 01:20:27.312
* Come on, bring it now *

01:20:27.391 --> 01:20:30.589
* Nothing's gonna stand
in the way *

01:20:30.662 --> 01:20:33.720
* l won't back down *

01:20:33.797 --> 01:20:36.993
* I'll do it
till l do it again *

01:20:37.067 --> 01:20:41.366
* Come on,
bring it now... *

01:20:41.438 --> 01:20:44.067
- Come on, fuck him up, Richie!
- Come on.

01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:46.707
Come on.

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:49.667
How does your face feel, asshole?
Come on.

01:20:49.746 --> 01:20:52.235
Tony, your son
is a terrific fighter.

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:54.180
He's got a great coach.

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:57.013
Good thing he retired,
because l heard

01:20:57.086 --> 01:20:59.714
his wife was gonna
break his legs if he didn't.

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:03.119
Come on.

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:06.490
* It's worth
dreaming for *

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:09.894
* Pressure's
going down on you *

01:21:09.964 --> 01:21:13.400
* Never let it show *

01:21:13.466 --> 01:21:16.197
* When they think
they got you... *

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:17.896
Come on!

01:21:20.074 --> 01:21:23.976
* Come on,
bring it now *

01:21:24.043 --> 01:21:27.069
* Nothing's gonna
stand in the way *

01:21:27.146 --> 01:21:30.014
* l won't back down *

01:21:30.084 --> 01:21:33.484
* I'll do it
till l do it again *

01:21:33.553 --> 01:21:37.387
* Come on,
bring it now *

01:21:37.456 --> 01:21:39.788
* Nothing's gonna stand
in the way *

01:21:39.858 --> 01:21:42.725
* l won't back down. *

01:21:42.794 --> 01:21:45.729
Yeah!

01:21:45.798 --> 01:21:47.128
Whoo!

01:21:50.469 --> 01:21:52.402
Thanks for coming.
Hey, how are you doing?

01:21:52.471 --> 01:21:54.404
Hey, what's up, man?
How are you doing?

01:21:54.471 --> 01:21:56.736
Richie, great fucking
fight tonight, man.

01:21:56.807 --> 01:21:58.933
- Hey, l'm proud of you, bro.
- Thanks, Diamond man.

01:21:59.009 --> 01:22:01.001
l couldn't have done it without you.
Thank you so much.

01:22:01.077 --> 01:22:02.840
- Pop that baby.
- Let's get it going.

01:22:02.912 --> 01:22:04.938
- Ow!
- Ooh, yeah.

01:22:10.021 --> 01:22:11.954
Hello there, gorgeous.

01:22:12.022 --> 01:22:15.550
Hi. You don't
miss it, do you?

01:22:15.626 --> 01:22:17.217
Sometimes.

01:22:17.293 --> 01:22:19.089
Do l have to worry about
you fighting again?

01:22:19.161 --> 01:22:21.426
lf there's one thing
that l learned from all this,

01:22:21.498 --> 01:22:25.298
it's that l'm a lover,
not a fighter.

01:22:30.707 --> 01:22:33.730
Hey, where's Diego?

- Hey, there he is, look.

01:22:39.179 --> 01:22:41.272

with that fine lady.

01:22:41.349 --> 01:22:43.339
- Whoo!
- Ow!

01:22:48.889 --> 01:22:51.255
* So much, so much,
so much to say *

01:22:51.324 --> 01:22:54.157
* Being with you
takes me away *

01:22:54.227 --> 01:22:56.661
* So much, so much,
so much l wanna do. *

01:23:08.074 --> 01:23:13.170
* You say you know

01:23:15.881 --> 01:23:20.909
* What waits for you
across the line *

of backing down *

01:23:37.502 --> 01:23:41.733
* And l'm here now
feeling the pain *

01:23:41.805 --> 01:23:44.102
* Of a thousand hearts *

01:23:44.172 --> 01:23:46.734

01:23:57.286 --> 01:24:03.020
* You try so hard
to bring me down *

01:24:03.091 --> 01:24:05.421

01:24:05.493 --> 01:24:10.625
* You still don't seem
to understand *

01:24:10.698 --> 01:24:13.633
