<i>[upbeat saxophone music]</i>

00:06.131 --> 00:07.340
<i>- Gonna meet</i>
<i>the new neighbors.</i>

00:07.382 --> 00:08.800
I made them guacamole
using avocados

00:08.842 --> 00:11.094
from their tree
that hangs over our fence.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.763
I'd love to go.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.640
- Oh, you wanna welcome them
to the neighborhood too?

00:15.682 --> 00:18.685
- Yeah, I'd like
to welcome them to leave.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.354
These gentrifiers can take
their artisan sandwiches

00:21.396 --> 00:23.356
and their crusty white dogs
in strollers

00:23.398 --> 00:24.858
and those shoes
that make them look like

00:24.899 --> 00:26.693
they're always walking uphill

00:26.735 --> 00:28.695
and get out.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.447
- How do you even know
they're gentrifiers?

00:30.488 --> 00:32.365
Because they didn't hire me.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.200
They hired
some fancy moving company

00:34.242 --> 00:35.910
with a bunch
of unnecessary frills

00:35.952 --> 00:37.620
like bubble wrap and insurance

00:37.662 --> 00:39.581
and employees
that speak English.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.084
- Yeah, well,
let's not judge the book

00:43.126 --> 00:44.502
before
we've even met the cover.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.796
- The cover is
all you need to see, Mayan.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.715
I guarantee you
someone living in that house

00:48.757 --> 00:51.259
has a name like--
[mockingly] Dakota or Savannah

00:51.301 --> 00:53.053
or Piper or--

00:53.094 --> 00:55.347
Juniper.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.681
Just call me June.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.016
And thanks for the guac.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.101
It'll go great with
the authentic tortilla chips

01:00.143 --> 01:01.811
I brought back from TJ.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.229
Ah, you hear that, Dad?

01:03.271 --> 01:04.606
They went to TJ.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.734
- Yeah,
Trader Joe's is the best.

01:07.776 --> 01:08.943
You hear that, Mayan,

01:08.985 --> 01:11.363
or was it drowned out
by the white noise?

01:12.614 --> 01:15.158
- Oh, Paloma,
say hi to our new neighbors.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.743
Hi.

01:16.785 --> 01:17.702
Whoa.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.246
Paloma? Wow.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.706
You gave your daughter
a Latina's name.

01:21.748 --> 01:22.749
It means "dove."

01:22.791 --> 01:24.793
I know what it means.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.588
- In the words
of the great Michelangelo,

01:28.630 --> 01:30.465
cowabunga!

01:32.509 --> 01:34.344
You watch "Ninja Turtles"?

01:34.386 --> 01:36.304
I just got
the new Shredder LEGO set.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.472
Wanna see it?

01:40.058 --> 01:42.519
- Close your mouth, Gordo,
and get in there, man.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.648
Oh, you also had a baby
way too young.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.608
That is so cool.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.860
- Yep, my water broke
during senior prom.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.279
It really added to the whole
"Under the Sea" theme.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.156
- [chuckles]
Mine broke in calculus.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.825
I had to explain
to a bunch of math nerds

01:56.866 --> 01:58.284
where all the water
was coming from

01:58.326 --> 01:59.953
and then what a vagina was.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.162
Yeah.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.664
- [gags]
Mayan, come on.

02:02.706 --> 02:06.167
Nobody wants to be thinking
about math class.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.961
- Thinking and math class--

02:08.003 --> 02:10.338
two things you were
never good at, Georgie.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.300
- Stevie, what the hell
are you doing here?

02:14.342 --> 02:15.802
- What the hell
are you doing here?

02:15.844 --> 02:17.470
- Oh, are you and my dad
old friends?

02:17.512 --> 02:19.514
Oh, I don't think so, June.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.808
Friends is another thing
my dad was never good at.

02:23.184 --> 02:26.146
<i>[upbeat saxophone music]</i>

02:26.187 --> 02:33.319
<i>* *</i>

02:38.324 --> 02:39.576
- I thought
your parents sold the house

02:39.617 --> 02:40.994
when you went to the state pen.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.997
I went to Penn State.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.749
Tomato, potato.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.085
- Gran and Nan
never sold the house.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.253
They just rented it out.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.880
I own it now,
and Dad moved in with us.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.173
[laughs]

02:53.214 --> 02:54.841
You can't even afford
your own place, Stevie.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.885
That's lame, 'ey.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.845
- But Dad, you--
- Let you live with me.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.513
That's one
of the many charitable acts

03:00.555 --> 03:04.601
of the George Lopez
Foundation, L.L.Bean.

03:04.642 --> 03:07.187
- You think I forgot about
that prank war you started?

03:07.228 --> 03:08.730
He toilet-papered our house,

03:08.772 --> 03:11.483
with one ply,
you cheapskate.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.526
- Only because you ratted
on an illegal candy stand

03:13.568 --> 03:15.236
I was running
around the corner.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.237
I don't understand.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.530
Was the stand illegal,

03:17.572 --> 03:19.157
or were you
selling illegal candy?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.618
- Both, Mayan.
Try to keep up.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.119
And then,
that fool opened

03:23.161 --> 03:24.621
a lemonade stand
on the same spot.

03:24.662 --> 03:27.040
Even as a kid,
you were a dirty gentrifier.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.333
Gentrifier?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.542
We lived in this neighborhood

03:29.584 --> 03:31.878
before you guys even moved in,

03:31.920 --> 03:33.380
dummy.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.965
- And before that,
LA was Mexico!

03:36.007 --> 03:38.426
This land is our land, tonto!

03:40.887 --> 03:43.056
Welcome to our land.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.850
<i>* *</i>

03:46.476 --> 03:49.229
- Okay, I know it's mostly dogs
at the vet clinic,

03:49.270 --> 03:51.940
but do you think that
you can smuggle home a cobra?

03:53.775 --> 03:55.193
Why?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.195
Are you planning
on killing Stevie?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.571
Oh, of course not.

03:58.613 --> 03:59.656
I'm just gonna
put it in his toilet

03:59.698 --> 04:02.033
so it can bite his huevos.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.576
Oh, God, whose huevos

04:03.618 --> 04:05.745
is your father after this time?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.664
He hates the new neighbors.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.499
- And so should you, Mayan.
You're my daughter.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.917
You should
have my back on this.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.378
- Can you please
just let all this stuff go?

04:13.420 --> 04:14.754
June seems really nice,

04:14.796 --> 04:17.590
and it'd be great
to finally have a mom friend.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.592
Hello?

04:19.634 --> 04:21.302
I mean someone my age.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.472
Uh, not just someone
who looks my age.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.891
Good save.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.601
- You want a mom friend
in the neighborhood?

04:28.643 --> 04:31.062
I see plenty
of pop-up ads online saying

04:31.104 --> 04:33.481
there are a lot of lonely moms
in our area who wanna connect.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.899
Call one of them.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.653
- You shouldn't
let your dad say

04:38.695 --> 04:40.196
who you can be friends with.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.489
I haven't talked
to my maid of honor

04:41.531 --> 04:43.533
since the wedding,
because according to George,

04:43.575 --> 04:45.410
her husband danced too French.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.662
What does that mean?

04:47.704 --> 04:49.372
I still don't know.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.167
<i>* *</i>

04:52.208 --> 04:54.377
Okay, light it up.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.796
[doorbell rings]

05:00.383 --> 05:03.261
The old dog poop
in a burning bag.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.221
Pathetic, Georgie!

05:05.263 --> 05:06.806
I'm not stamping on that!

05:06.848 --> 05:09.309
- He's onto us.
- No, he's not.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.810
I did a Latino version of it.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.312
I put a firecracker in there.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.439
I call it "The Firecrapper."

05:14.481 --> 05:15.899
- [bag explodes]
- [groans]

05:17.776 --> 05:19.986
You're gonna pay
for this, Georgie!

05:20.028 --> 05:22.280
- How'd you get that much poop?
Your dog's so tiny.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.282
- I tried to get her to eat
a box of frozen cheeseburgers,

05:24.324 --> 05:25.784
and she wouldn't.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.161
So I chewed 'em up,
and I spit 'em back in the bag.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.829

Oscar, you're better
than my own flesh and blood.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.382
I don't know about that.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.716
Those things keep you alive

05:41.758 --> 05:44.886
and your bones
inside your body.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.221
- You know what?
Just drink your beer.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.348
I think you'd make more sense
when you're drunk.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.058
- Hey, we got Stevie good.
- Mm.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.227
- He will never top that prank.
- Never.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.241
This is
the lamest prank call ever.

- [towing device whirs]
- What's happening?

06:08.159 --> 06:10.078

06:11.287 --> 06:12.580
Oh!

06:17.794 --> 06:20.171
At least this is
bringing us closer together.

Don't worry, buddy.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.821
Your body hair will come in

06:44.863 --> 06:46.239
the same age mine did--

06:46.281 --> 06:48.199
24.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.202

for the girl next door.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.830

Paloma.

06:53.872 --> 06:57.417
I want our playdates
to be less play, more date,

06:57.459 --> 06:59.169
if you know what I mean.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.630
- This is so romantic--

07:02.672 --> 07:05.759
forbidden love
between two warring houses.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.927
It's just like
my D&D campaign.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.513
A blood feud prevents
Bongadir Rockcrusher

07:10.555 --> 07:12.724

from marrying

07:12.766 --> 07:16.478

to a half-dwarf, half-orc--

07:16.519 --> 07:19.064
a dorc.

Can you imagine it?

07:21.024 --> 07:22.025
Now I can.

So what do I do?

07:25.612 --> 07:27.822
- Whoa.
You want my advice?

07:27.864 --> 07:30.992
- Yeah, you're with Mom,
so you have experience

07:31.034 --> 07:34.037
getting someone
way out of your league.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.330

07:49.594 --> 07:51.638
Oh, that sounds amazing.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.599
Drunk kids always nap

07:56.226 --> 07:57.894
I'll call you later.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.688
- Well, Mayan,
our wonderful new neighbors

07:59.729 --> 08:01.606
had my trucked towed...

08:01.648 --> 08:02.982
while I was in it!

08:04.567 --> 08:06.069
And you found your way home.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.862
Good boy!

08:07.904 --> 08:09.864
- That's not funny.
I didn't even do nothing.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.075
[chuckles] Please.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.577
You never--
[as George] don't do nothing.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.872
You always take their side.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.208
You're not just a bad daughter,

08:20.250 --> 08:22.335
you're La Malinche.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.254
Rude.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.214
What is that?

08:26.256 --> 08:29.592
- During colonization,
La Malinche was an Aztec woman

08:29.634 --> 08:31.553
who collaborated
with the Spaniards

08:31.594 --> 08:33.513
to help them
conquer her own people.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.473
Since when do you read?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.891
It was on the Chipotle bag

08:36.933 --> 08:40.395
during
the Hispanic Heritage Month.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.147
But the moral still stands--

08:42.188 --> 08:44.232
stick with your own side
and get their back.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.692
- You know,
everything shouldn't have

08:45.734 --> 08:46.943
to be about sides.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.403
- Well then,
you clearly don't understand

08:48.445 --> 08:50.405
the Chipotle menu.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.323
- Why is it so hard
for you to let this go?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.743
It's not a beer.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.747
- Because Stevie stabbed me
in the back.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.206
We were very close, Mayan.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.125
Then he turned on me.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.836
And I haven't had
a best friend since.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.671
What about Oscar?

09:06.713 --> 09:08.673
- I don't care
if he has a best friend.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.926
So you shouldn't
trust Stevie's daughter

09:11.968 --> 09:13.678
because she's gonna do
the same thing to you, Mayan.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.305
The apple doesn't fart
from the tree.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.266
- You talkin'
about the neighbor's tree?

09:18.308 --> 09:19.642
It's crazy what they did.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.061
What are you talking about?

09:21.102 --> 09:22.312
The neighbors put up a net

09:22.354 --> 09:25.065
and cut off our access
to their avocados.

09:25.106 --> 09:28.068
Now we gotta steal 'em
from another neighbor.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.111
- I'm sure
June wasn't involved.

09:30.153 --> 09:33.156
I mean, I made her guacamole
with those stolen avocados.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.701
You mean this guacamole?

09:44.834 --> 09:46.169
- Oh, yeah.
That's your guacamole.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.091
- I was so sure
she wanted to be my friend.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.259
I bet this is why
she canceled our playdate.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.220
- And now there's
an avocado-shaped knife

09:55.261 --> 09:56.304
in your back.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.014
- Ha!
That's not a very sharp knife.

09:59.224 --> 10:03.019
But it cuts just as deep.
I gotta go.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.815
- I told you, Mayan.
Those gentrifiers suck.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.566
- I tried so hard
to be welcoming,

10:08.608 --> 10:10.402
but I guess you were right.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.861
Finally!

10:11.903 --> 10:13.613
Now let's go to their house
and fill their crawl space

10:13.655 --> 10:15.365
with tilapia.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.825
We're not doing that.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.911
- Yeah, you're right.
It's too mild a fish.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.039
How about day-old mackerel?

10:24.708 --> 10:26.668
- Someone has to be
the bigger person

10:26.710 --> 10:29.129
and put an end to this feud.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.006
[guitar playing]
What's that?

10:31.047 --> 10:33.091
- I don't know.
You better go check it out.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.302
- Don't eat
the fence guacamole!

10:36.344 --> 10:39.639

10:39.681 --> 10:43.268
* Cómo sufría por ella *

11:15.300 --> 11:17.469

11:19.971 --> 11:21.931
I want you
to be my girlfriend, Paloma.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.808
What do you say?

11:23.850 --> 11:25.435
- I say,
get off my property.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.105
You will never date a Lopez,

11:29.147 --> 11:31.566
unless he's related
to that Mario Lopez.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.276
I just love that guy.
[laughs]

11:37.030 --> 11:39.240
- Hey, Gordo.
Hey, are you okay?

11:39.282 --> 11:41.659
- No.
I may never love again.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.411
That's probably true.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.871
One love is all you get.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.501
- You can steal
my stolen avocados,

11:49.542 --> 11:52.462
but no one messes with my boy.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.464
I am not Malinche.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.341

here's how we get them back.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.646
We set up a ramp

12:09.688 --> 12:12.065
to send an army of chickens
over the fence

12:12.107 --> 12:15.235
to crap all over their yard.

12:15.276 --> 12:19.364

<i>- I put live chickens</i>

12:23.034 --> 12:26.454

cross the road?

12:27.330 --> 12:29.791
Because it didn't wanna
go up the damn ramp!

12:29.833 --> 12:32.502

Operation Cluck in Awe,

then go for it.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.130

What if you build

12:43.930 --> 12:45.390
- What would that do?
- I don't know.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.935
But we would have a cool tunnel

12:50.937 --> 12:54.691

What if we reclaim the tree

13:12.083 --> 13:16.087
Hmm? And show them
whose tree it really is.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.174

Okay, Mayan, after this,

We're literally carving

Uh-oh.

No!

before they see us.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.529
What the hell?

Mayan?

14:24.072 --> 14:25.407
No, it's...

14:25.448 --> 14:27.951
Monica Lewinsky.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.415
Live long and prosper, you two.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.584
Mayan, this is really insane.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.796

letting us steal your fruit.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.214

14:41.256 --> 14:44.634

Dad?

14:46.344 --> 14:47.637
Don't look at me.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.139
I enjoyed the guacamole.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.975
It had gala-penos.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.560
Well, someone did it.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.357
- I had to trick you
to win the war.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.694
It's like the Greeks did
with the Trojan horse condoms.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.613
- What?
- I don't know.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.450
The Greek restaurant
doesn't have a heritage month.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.326
The point is,
you should've had my back

15:10.368 --> 15:12.162

all right?

15:12.203 --> 15:13.997
This is all your fault.
You know how I am.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.707
You towed his truck?

15:15.749 --> 15:18.043
Two words: Poop bomb.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.378
It's a firecrapper,

15:20.420 --> 15:23.548
trademark, copy machine,
passion pending.

15:24.716 --> 15:27.260
- You said you--
[as George] didn't do nothing.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.095
- I didn't do nothing.
I did something.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.347
Because it's his fault--
he's the one

15:30.388 --> 15:32.015
that said that
Chance can't hang with Paloma.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.184
- What?
Of course they can hang out.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.019
Dad, that's not cool!

15:36.061 --> 15:37.604
I need a break from Paloma.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.275
The Lopezes are freaks.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.485
And let me be clear.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.153
I'm not talking
about my man Mario.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.572
He's the right kind of freak.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.367
- Just clean up your tree
and fix your fence, Stevie.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.869
- Hey, it looks like
the tree is in your yard,

15:52.911 --> 15:54.746
so it's your tree now, Georgie.

15:58.375 --> 16:02.837
- I am so sorry
about the tree and my dad.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.423
Ugh, I am sorry too.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.009
I just hope
we can move past this.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.219
Really?

16:09.260 --> 16:10.470
I thought
you didn't wanna be friends

16:10.512 --> 16:12.055
after you canceled
our playdate.

16:12.097 --> 16:14.265
- No, that was just because
I was busy cleaning up dog poop

16:14.307 --> 16:16.059
and cheeseburgers
off my porch...

16:16.101 --> 16:17.894
and my dad.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.730
Trust me, I have always
wanted a young mom friend.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.190
Me too.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.150
I mean, all my girlfriends
are single...

16:24.192 --> 16:25.985
or a dog.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.404
Same.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.489
If only my dog could
relate to my mom problems,

16:29.531 --> 16:32.909
but Donut doesn't pee
when he sneezes.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.285
Donut?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.121
My dog's name is Churro.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.290
- [gasps]
That means donut in Spanish.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.876
Okay, this friendship
was obviously meant to be,

16:41.918 --> 16:44.504
so we need to find a way
to get our dads to get along.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.172
Well, that's gonna be hard.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.424
I mean, the only thing
they have in common

16:47.465 --> 16:49.926
is that they both
like gala-penos.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.428
So my dad was right?

16:51.469 --> 16:54.597
Oh, I've been mispronouncing it
my whole life.

I could come over.

wear your hoodie?

17:18.747 --> 17:22.834

zero sense of whimsy.

you want to be together.

Hi, Chance.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.593

I will be your girlfriend.

I thought you were
heartbroken over Paloma.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.863
I was yesterday.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.741
Since then,
I discovered older women.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.327
You have?

17:57.369 --> 18:00.330
Yeah, Eliza.

Chance...

18:14.928 --> 18:16.596
It begins.

Churro and Donut are happy.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.192

- Right?

19:25.707 --> 19:28.501

19:52.984 --> 19:55.070
be ruined by a bunch
of book-loving hippies

19:55.111 --> 19:57.364
who think that
they're too good to watch TV!

19:58.990 --> 20:00.658
- There's a new episode
of "The Voice" on tonight.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.577
I love that John Legend.

20:02.619 --> 20:08.667
<i>* *</i>

20:08.708 --> 20:11.628
- Well, looks like our dads
are finally getting along.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.338
- Guess all they needed
was a common enemy.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.006
Die, library!

20:18.760 --> 20:20.345
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Man.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.848
This reminds me of the time we
did this to the real library.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.350
- Yeah,
we taught that librarian

20:25.392 --> 20:27.102
not to tell us to shut up.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.145
If you're gonna carry
"MAD" magazine,

20:29.187 --> 20:31.648
expect people to laugh.

20:31.690 --> 20:34.109
- Oh, man.
Good times, huh, Stevie?

20:34.150 --> 20:36.486
Can't sledgehammer a book.
Hey, get the lighter fluid.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.533
- Well, Georgie,
I guess I'm glad

20:41.574 --> 20:43.993
you and Stevie
are friends again.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.704
- Well, this feud
wouldn't have restarted

20:45.745 --> 20:47.288
if you had gotten my back
in the first place

20:47.330 --> 20:48.707
and stayed away from them.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.041
- Please,
I get your back all the time,

20:50.083 --> 20:51.960
but not when
you're acting like an idiot.

20:52.002 --> 20:54.796
It's my way of trying
to make you better.

20:54.838 --> 20:56.548
- Just so you know, I got your
back even when you're wrong

20:56.589 --> 20:57.882
because that's how I roll.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.926
- You literally just
destroyed something I made

20:59.968 --> 21:01.886
because
you thought I was wrong.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.430
- Why do you keep
bringing up old stuff?

21:08.351 --> 21:10.228
- Whoa.
- Burn, stupid books.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.230
A bonfire.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.441
Isn't this romantic?

21:16.735 --> 21:18.945
Yeah, really romantic.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.406
I wish I could help you,

21:21.448 --> 21:23.450
but I've never had
to dump anyone.

21:26.077 --> 21:29.039
