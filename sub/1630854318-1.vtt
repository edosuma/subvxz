02:07.791 --> 02:09.000
<i>Close your eyes…</i>

02:11.875 --> 02:13.958
<i>…and place your attention on your breath.</i>

02:16.666 --> 02:17.958
<i>Breathe in…</i>

02:20.083 --> 02:21.166
<i>and out.</i>

02:24.166 --> 02:27.833
<i>Just put your attention on the breath</i>
<i>coming into your body as you inhale.</i>

02:30.250 --> 02:31.500
<i>It's clear.</i>

02:33.416 --> 02:34.625
<i>Nothing.</i>

02:36.333 --> 02:38.125
<i>And as you breathe out…</i>

02:39.458 --> 02:41.458
<i>…the air</i>
<i>that comes out of you is black.</i>

02:42.375 --> 02:45.625
<i>And that black is any anxiety, stress,</i>

02:46.708 --> 02:48.083
<i>any worries that you carry.</i>

02:50.291 --> 02:52.708
<i>And as you breathe out,</i>
<i>feel it leave your body.</i>

02:54.000 --> 02:58.208
<i>Breathe in clear air</i>
<i>and breathe out the black.</i>

03:01.000 --> 03:02.916
<i>Breathe in clear air.</i>

03:03.708 --> 03:04.583
<i>Breathe out--</i>

04:26.708 --> 04:28.416
There I am standing

04:28.500 --> 04:32.708
in front of this old
nothing house, staring at it,

04:33.375 --> 04:34.958
and this bloke comes over.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.958
And I recognize him, you know?

04:38.041 --> 04:40.333
Older, but I recognize him.

04:40.416 --> 04:44.000
I said, "It's me, Paul Emery.
I used to live in that house."

04:47.208 --> 04:49.875
And he goes, "No. No, you didn't."

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
I said, "You're Chris."

04:57.291 --> 05:01.291
"Chris. You had that German Shepherd."
He says, "How did you know that?"

05:03.291 --> 05:06.000
"We lived in this house for years."

05:07.750 --> 05:10.666
-This old fellow--
-You heading to WA for work?

05:12.291 --> 05:13.708
No.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.000
Never actually been there before.

05:17.875 --> 05:18.875
Yourself?

05:19.666 --> 05:21.791
Home. Headed home.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.333
No, I just had to, uh, clear out…

05:30.500 --> 05:31.916
Clear out of Queensland.

05:34.916 --> 05:37.000
Sort myself a car.

05:37.083 --> 05:39.291
Some place to stay and that.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.333
I'm Paul.

05:47.875 --> 05:48.708
Henry.

06:08.416 --> 06:09.791
Turn her off again.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.333
And again.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.583
Yeah. Let's hear her, mate.

06:24.833 --> 06:27.208
I need an address for
the transfer of ownership.

06:27.958 --> 06:28.833
Yeah.

06:30.583 --> 06:33.333
-I can put down a motel?
-I don't know about that.

06:34.041 --> 06:37.416
-That's where I'm living. A motel.
-Can't put down a motel.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.375
I've got a PO box you can use,
put that down while he sorts himself out.

06:41.458 --> 06:42.625
-Okay.
-Thanks.

06:44.041 --> 06:45.125
Thanks, Henry.

06:45.833 --> 06:46.708
All right.

06:48.416 --> 06:49.333
$1,600.

06:54.041 --> 06:55.791
-Here, mate. That's for you.
-Nah.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.708
Come on, mate.
I mean, you really helped me out.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.625
No.

07:05.041 --> 07:07.041
What do you do for work, Henry?

07:07.583 --> 07:09.666
Everything I know is in my hands.

07:10.166 --> 07:11.750
Can't hardly work now though.

07:11.833 --> 07:13.666
I'll be fucked in a few years' time.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.625
And why's that?

07:16.750 --> 07:18.250
Can't fuckin' breathe, mate.

07:19.791 --> 07:22.458
I know what it's like to be
on the other side of things.

07:23.375 --> 07:26.291
You got your last few fuckin' dollars
in an envelope there.

07:27.375 --> 07:28.708
I see it all over you.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.375
Paul Emery?

07:47.833 --> 07:50.750
<i>I can't, uh,</i>
<i>take your call at the moment.</i>

07:50.833 --> 07:54.333
<i>If you leave me a message,</i>
<i>I'll endeavor to call you back later.</i>

07:55.458 --> 07:56.458
Henry, it's Paul.

07:57.291 --> 07:59.208
I need to talk to you about something.

07:59.708 --> 08:01.750
I might need to shift out of the motel.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.208
So give us a ring back when you get this.

08:06.333 --> 08:07.291
Okay. Talk soon.

08:17.083 --> 08:21.458
So it's just a bit further up here.
There's a house. You can drop me off.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.791
All right, I have to tell you, Henry…

08:26.791 --> 08:30.625
I came out here
to do a job for some people.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.625
And there's a mate of mine.

08:34.458 --> 08:38.208
Mark. He asked me if I knew anyone
who could handle a bit of work.

08:38.916 --> 08:40.291
I talked to him about you.

08:41.708 --> 08:43.291
Yeah, just here is good.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.250
Yeah, this is good. Just here.

08:55.333 --> 08:56.416
What kind of work?

08:57.666 --> 08:59.125
I have to let him tell ya.

09:00.250 --> 09:01.875
I don't do violence.

09:03.041 --> 09:06.333
No, Henry, come on. It's not like that.

09:07.791 --> 09:10.750
We'll meet him tomorrow.
He'll tell you all about it.

09:14.833 --> 09:16.041
Have you dyed your hair?

09:18.125 --> 09:19.000
What?

09:20.208 --> 09:21.541
Have you dyed your hair?

09:24.291 --> 09:26.125
Yeah, I just went a bit darker.

09:32.708 --> 09:34.000
It looks good.

09:36.541 --> 09:37.375
Thanks.

09:39.541 --> 09:40.708
Tell him we're on.

09:42.291 --> 09:43.166
Yep.

09:45.875 --> 09:49.750
Great. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks for the lift.

10:19.208 --> 10:21.416
-Where's Paul?
-He couldn't make it.

10:23.458 --> 10:24.458
Get in.

10:28.208 --> 10:29.125
Get in.

10:37.458 --> 10:38.625
Put your seatbelt on.

10:43.875 --> 10:44.958
I don't do violence.

10:47.166 --> 10:48.958
No. I've heard.

11:18.708 --> 11:21.541
Fat cunt.

11:23.833 --> 11:25.416
What are we doing here?

11:25.916 --> 11:26.791
Wait here.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.916
How you doin', Mark? Good?

11:34.041 --> 11:35.375
Why'd you call me?

11:35.458 --> 11:37.541
Look, I've got your passports ready.

11:37.625 --> 11:41.375
They're all clean and unmarked.
And I'm so sorry I couldn't get the money.

11:41.666 --> 11:43.833
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be sorry. Why?

11:43.916 --> 11:45.375
I tried everything I could.

11:45.458 --> 11:47.583
-But--
-I'll get it for you Tuesday.

11:50.958 --> 11:53.458
By the way,
there's a girl shifting gear around

11:53.541 --> 11:55.291
out of Central Massage.

11:55.375 --> 11:56.250
Who?

11:56.750 --> 11:58.041
You remember Letessia?

11:58.583 --> 12:00.166
-Who?
-Letessia.

12:00.583 --> 12:01.750
Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.875
She's dealing out of the rooms.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.125
-Next week, Ken.
-12:00 sharp?

12:07.208 --> 12:10.250
-What will you do? Thank you.
-Get your money.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.250
No carparks from now on. Fuck.

12:20.916 --> 12:23.041
Shift around gear. Is that it?

12:23.125 --> 12:24.625
No, we don't fuckin' touch it.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.208
You don't use when you work with us, okay?

12:31.125 --> 12:34.708
I've heard that you don't have
many acquaintances, which is good for us.

12:36.791 --> 12:37.750
Works well.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.875
'Cause you don't discuss
this work with anyone.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.458
Open that.

12:54.333 --> 12:55.208
It's blank.

13:05.708 --> 13:07.083
It's just here.

13:10.375 --> 13:16.000
You know,
he's in, uh, trouble. Old mate. Paul.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.000
That's why they had to bring him out here.

13:20.583 --> 13:21.458
What's wrong?

13:21.541 --> 13:24.458
If he contacts you and it's not
through me, just let me know.

13:26.750 --> 13:29.125
Don't you go tell Paul
what I said about him.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.208
Where's your place?

13:49.541 --> 13:51.000
Little piece of fluff.

13:53.416 --> 13:54.291
Thanks.

14:29.583 --> 14:33.333
One, two, three, four, five.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.083
I'm a sworn member
of the Western Australian Police,

14:38.166 --> 14:41.333
conducting duties
at the Undercover Crimes Unit

14:41.416 --> 14:44.875
in the investigation into
the abduction and murder

14:44.958 --> 14:49.791
of James Liston on the 12th of May, 2002.

14:49.875 --> 14:53.208
Today's date is May 6, 2010.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.000
My CO number is 452

14:57.083 --> 15:00.791
and I'm using the assumed name
of Mark Frame.

15:13.458 --> 15:15.583
<i>Old mate, he called me last night.</i>

15:15.708 --> 15:18.416
<i>I let it go to voicemail</i>
<i>like… like you said.</i>

15:19.250 --> 15:21.833
Uh, he wanted me to, uh,
to collect this, though.

15:22.625 --> 15:23.833
Yeah, I'll take that.

15:23.916 --> 15:26.041
He's at a property
out of town for a while.

15:28.791 --> 15:29.916
What?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.750
I thought I saw a car.

15:32.583 --> 15:33.708
What'd it look like?

15:34.375 --> 15:36.208
Ah, it's a van. It's turned off now.

15:40.208 --> 15:41.791
Hey, just hold on a sec.

16:03.416 --> 16:04.625
All right, Henry?

16:06.458 --> 16:08.000
Have you seen the sea?

16:12.875 --> 16:13.750
Hey.

16:17.166 --> 16:18.125
Hey, Gary.

16:18.208 --> 16:22.041
-This, um, came for Paul yesterday.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.000
Henry.

16:25.416 --> 16:26.458
Come here.

16:26.541 --> 16:28.416
This is Henry Teague.

16:29.541 --> 16:30.750
That's Gary.

16:34.166 --> 16:36.250
You can't come in here dressed like that.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.958
Get yourself some proper clothes.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.666
You look like a fuckin' criminal.

16:42.791 --> 16:45.416
Seriously, sort it out. Sit down.

16:52.208 --> 16:53.458
About Paul.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
He has issues in the past
and we have to resettle him.

16:58.750 --> 16:59.958
That creates an opening.

17:00.833 --> 17:02.333
We're a closed group.

17:02.458 --> 17:04.375
We don't often let people in,

17:04.458 --> 17:07.541
and when we do, we take care of our own.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.250
How's that sound to you, Henry?

17:14.083 --> 17:16.375
Yeah, why… Yeah, why not?

17:25.500 --> 17:28.875
Look, Mark. I don't have enough money
to buy new clothes, mate.

17:29.041 --> 17:33.500
-I can't fuckin' afford that, you know--
-Ah, mate. Mate, shh, listen. Here. Look.

17:35.708 --> 17:37.125
Yeah, don't worry about it.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.666
I'll look after you.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.583
See?

17:46.375 --> 17:48.125
Wait. I've gotta ask you something.

17:48.791 --> 17:53.208
That fella up there, Gary,
all right, he's the head here, okay?

17:53.291 --> 17:57.416
But there are people who he answers to
and they answer to people above them.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.333
But he told me to ask you
if you'd done time before.

18:03.625 --> 18:04.708
Yeah, I have, yeah.

18:04.791 --> 18:05.958
Mm-hmm. What for?

18:06.041 --> 18:09.208
Been in and out
a few times, nothing serious.

18:09.291 --> 18:10.916
So no longer stints then?

18:13.000 --> 18:16.291
I did time for an assault
up in the NT, okay?

18:16.375 --> 18:20.541
That's why no fucking violence, you know,
because of the time for repeat offenders.

18:20.625 --> 18:23.875
If you've done longer stints,
just fuckin' tell me, okay?

18:23.958 --> 18:26.250
Don't wait for me to ask you.
How long for?

18:28.416 --> 18:29.583
Two years.

18:30.708 --> 18:33.333
It was at a family crisis center
and there was this fella

18:33.416 --> 18:36.208
who kept chattin' about my
fuckin' missus all the time.

18:38.333 --> 18:39.250
I went for him.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.541
He ran off into the trees,
I went after him.

18:41.625 --> 18:44.500
Yeah, I don't fuck--
I don't care what you done, okay?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.250
What I care about is
you being honest with me.

18:48.375 --> 18:49.625
Yeah. Be honest with me.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.583
That's all I ask, mate, serious. Here.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.125
Cheers.

18:59.000 --> 18:59.916
What?

19:01.708 --> 19:04.666
Just… Nothin', man. All right.

19:04.750 --> 19:05.708
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

19:17.083 --> 19:18.166
Oi!

19:19.041 --> 19:20.500
What did you do?

19:21.833 --> 19:23.500
Get off the fuckin' table. Get--

19:23.583 --> 19:25.041
Here. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:25.125 --> 19:28.291
Come here. Sit on the-- Stand there.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.750
You've got bare feet.

19:30.666 --> 19:32.875
-What did you do that for?
-I didn't mean it.

19:33.541 --> 19:34.666
Fuckin' hell.

19:34.750 --> 19:36.500
Can you just pay attention?

19:37.125 --> 19:39.625
All right?
If I cut myself, whose fault is it?

19:47.083 --> 19:47.916
Fuck.

19:49.791 --> 19:51.458
What are you gonna do next time?

19:51.958 --> 19:54.125
-Clean it up.
-No, pay attention.

19:55.250 --> 19:56.958
All right. Come here.

19:57.791 --> 19:59.083
Listen. Look at me.

19:59.208 --> 20:01.958
Sorry I sweared at you, all right?
Go put your shoes on.

20:20.875 --> 20:24.083
<i>Hey, you want me to</i>
<i>teach you something I learned at work?</i>

20:25.208 --> 20:28.500
<i>Okay, you gotta close your eyes, yeah?</i>

20:28.583 --> 20:31.333
<i>Close your eyes and you gotta breathe in,</i>

20:31.916 --> 20:33.125
<i>and when you breathe in,</i>

20:34.083 --> 20:37.875
<i>you're gonna imagine that</i>
<i>you're breathing in really clear air.</i>

20:37.958 --> 20:39.333
You gonna get out in a sec?

20:40.375 --> 20:42.541
<i>And then when you breathe out, you're…</i>

20:42.625 --> 20:45.666
<i>you're gonna breathe out all the black…</i>

20:45.750 --> 20:46.750
Did you know…

20:46.833 --> 20:48.375
<i>…dark, bad air.</i>

20:48.458 --> 20:49.458
What?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.750
That there's a frog that makes this sound?

20:54.291 --> 20:56.666
<i>And that's all the things</i>
<i>you don't like.</i>

20:56.750 --> 20:58.000
Up top. Oh, don't hurt me.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.541
-I'm not trying to hurt you.
<i>-Like when you're angry…</i>

21:01.625 --> 21:03.125
You're getting it in my beard!

21:03.208 --> 21:04.958
<i>…or when you're scared and stuff.</i>

21:05.041 --> 21:06.791
-Close your eyes. Trust me.
-No.

21:06.916 --> 21:10.541
<i>Things you don't like</i>
<i>and then you breathe in the clear air…</i>

21:12.083 --> 21:13.791
<i>…and out the blackness.</i>

21:14.583 --> 21:15.875
There you go.

21:17.666 --> 21:20.458
Your whole body's gonna relax

21:20.541 --> 21:24.000
from your feet, your knees,

21:24.083 --> 21:25.750
your hips,

21:26.791 --> 21:30.666
your stomach, your chest.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.916
In the clear air…

21:35.375 --> 21:36.208
…out the black--

22:09.708 --> 22:11.208
Do you need a hand?

22:17.041 --> 22:18.166
Sorry.

22:35.833 --> 22:38.750
Ah, I'm just fucking with you.
You look good. Come on.

22:39.708 --> 22:41.791
Now he's gonna make me go shopping.

22:49.666 --> 22:50.666
Hey.

22:52.208 --> 22:53.458
Shut the fuckin' door.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.833
-What's going on here?
-Sit down.

22:58.875 --> 23:00.625
Hand over your phones.

23:00.708 --> 23:02.333
What do you need our phones for?

23:03.375 --> 23:04.333
Unlock them.

23:06.833 --> 23:08.333
What do you need them for?

23:08.416 --> 23:10.916
We're deleting all of Paul's contacts.

23:11.458 --> 23:14.083
He's downstairs. Give him this.

23:14.166 --> 23:15.666
John's taken care of everything.

23:16.333 --> 23:18.000
Have a drink with Paul

23:18.083 --> 23:20.208
and then we're taking him to the airport.

23:20.291 --> 23:23.375
And you, do whatever Mark tells you to do.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.166
There you fuckin' are.

23:32.958 --> 23:33.833
Sit down.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.458
-Hey, Henry.
-How you doing?

23:40.666 --> 23:42.583
All right, there's ten grand in there.

23:43.958 --> 23:45.541
Passport's been issued.

23:46.583 --> 23:47.958
Ticket to the UK as well.

23:49.125 --> 23:50.750
And your visa's good for a year.

23:53.541 --> 23:56.791
Listen, mate, whatever this is about,
I don't want to know about it.

23:56.875 --> 24:00.083
We don't need to know.
You told John and that's all that matters.

24:00.666 --> 24:01.500
Okay?

24:02.125 --> 24:05.000
And he reckons it'll all be over
by the time you get back.

24:07.041 --> 24:10.625
We've all got a history, mate.
We've all got a past.

24:12.291 --> 24:14.750
And now you're nobody. Woo-hoo.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.125
Cheer up, man.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.625
I'm gonna get us a drink.

24:35.916 --> 24:36.916
Henry…

24:41.208 --> 24:42.250
Trust Mark.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.916
Trust Mark. Yeah?

24:47.541 --> 24:50.125
If you're honest--
If you're honest with these guys,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.500
you'll be looked after, mate.
You'll be looked after.

25:04.458 --> 25:05.833
What are we doing out here?

25:06.625 --> 25:08.541
We're making sure that Paul's clean.

25:19.208 --> 25:20.375
Who's John?

25:21.416 --> 25:22.916
He's your employer.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.375
Sorry, I can be a bit of a cunt.

25:39.958 --> 25:42.333
I've had issues myself in the past.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.583
This is the only family I've ever had.

25:49.791 --> 25:52.125
So, listen, if you have any issues,

25:53.375 --> 25:56.250
if you need help or what have you,

25:56.958 --> 25:58.583
just come out here and you wait,

26:00.416 --> 26:01.791
and I'll find you, brother.

26:20.708 --> 26:24.041
After the child
was abducted from the underpass,

26:24.125 --> 26:26.875
he was questioned several times
due to his record.

26:28.041 --> 26:29.791
He refused psychological testing.

26:30.666 --> 26:33.333
He stated he had a history
of violent offences.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.708
There's an assault in the NT.

26:37.708 --> 26:38.833
Details aren't listed.

26:41.375 --> 26:45.916
We've been tasked P28
to reassess for the coronial inquest.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.416
At the time of the abduction,
P28's file was closed

26:49.500 --> 26:52.791
after detectives found
insufficient time or evidence

26:52.875 --> 26:55.333
for him to be considered
a person of interest.

26:55.416 --> 26:57.666
He has since relocated
to Western Australia.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.333
We've been tasked with P27.

27:04.416 --> 27:07.166
He has a history of assault
and sexual violence.

27:07.250 --> 27:10.208
His movements place him
in the region, the bypass road

27:10.291 --> 27:12.833
on the morning of the 12th of May, 2002.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.250
-We're tasked with P26.

27:17.333 --> 27:20.000
He has a lengthy history
of domestic assault charges.

27:20.083 --> 27:22.541
There are currently four AVOs
ascribed to him.

27:41.375 --> 27:42.500
Mark.

27:55.541 --> 27:58.166
Thank you for everything
you've done on this case.

27:58.916 --> 28:02.458
It's your groundwork got us to this point,
so you should be proud of that.

28:09.166 --> 28:10.541
See you on the other side.

28:11.208 --> 28:12.541
Flying back to Queensland?

28:13.625 --> 28:14.500
Hey!

28:18.833 --> 28:19.833
We burnt your car.

28:27.291 --> 28:30.833
<i>The decision is we can't have him</i>
<i>in densely populated areas,</i>

28:30.916 --> 28:32.083
<i>so isolate him further.</i>

28:33.583 --> 28:37.083
<i>Downside is we can't have</i>
<i>physical surveillance in remote areas,</i>

28:37.166 --> 28:39.541
<i>which means you'll be</i>
<i>unprotected and unobserved</i>

28:39.625 --> 28:41.500
<i>apart from the recording equipment.</i>

28:44.000 --> 28:46.875
<i>The whole operation hinges</i>
<i>on you getting closer with him.</i>

28:47.708 --> 28:49.291
<i>I know you fuckin' know this.</i>

28:49.916 --> 28:52.833
Don't find yourself in terrain
that you're unfamiliar with.

28:53.458 --> 28:57.375
Weigh the balance of the closeness you
could form against your own vulnerability.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.375
-Fuck!

29:31.458 --> 29:32.666
I said wait in the car.

29:33.791 --> 29:35.250
You were taking ages.

29:37.541 --> 29:39.625
Could've been one of those silent alarms.

29:39.708 --> 29:42.166
Ah, I sorted that ages ago.

29:42.833 --> 29:44.375
Here. I forgot your brand.

29:45.208 --> 29:46.875
-Here you go.
-Thanks, mate.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.583
-Do you want a smoke?
-Nah. I quit.

30:07.041 --> 30:08.916
<i>Do you want a smoke?</i>

30:09.000 --> 30:10.583
<i>Nah. I quit.</i>

30:13.666 --> 30:16.041
<i>I couldn't find a job</i>
<i>anywhere before this.</i>

30:16.958 --> 30:19.541
<i>You got a criminal record,</i>
<i>you're fucked these days.</i>

30:20.416 --> 30:21.750
<i>My dad was in the Army.</i>

30:23.708 --> 30:26.000
<i>Thought about joining the Reserves myself.</i>

30:26.833 --> 30:28.333
<i>I did all the tests.</i>

30:29.541 --> 30:32.166
<i>I failed the psych</i>
<i>'cause I fuckin' sleepwalk.</i>

30:52.291 --> 30:53.708
<i>Do I look like a monster?</i>

30:53.791 --> 30:54.625
What?

30:54.708 --> 30:58.166
I can taste with my feet
and hear with my fur.

30:58.250 --> 30:59.625
-What am I?
-What?

30:59.708 --> 31:00.958
A moth.

31:01.041 --> 31:03.416
You're a pain in the arse,
that's what you are.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.375
-No, here, here. Here.

31:09.416 --> 31:11.291
All right, mate. See you Thursday.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.666
This is Detective Senior Constable
Kate Rylett

31:17.750 --> 31:20.375
in the presence of Detective
Senior Constable Graham Ikin.

31:20.458 --> 31:22.416
We are carrying out a timing
of the movements

31:22.500 --> 31:27.166
of POI 28, Henry Teague,
on the 12th May, 2002.

31:28.708 --> 31:32.125
<i>P28 claims to have left</i>
<i>his home at 2:50 p.m.</i>

31:32.208 --> 31:34.375
<i>and returned at 5:30 p.m.</i>

31:35.166 --> 31:38.500
<i>He drove along the bypass</i>
<i>towards a relative's house,</i>

31:38.583 --> 31:41.208
<i>he parked and collected an engine part.</i>

31:43.500 --> 31:47.166
<i>He returned along the same road,</i>
<i>passing the bus stop at the underpass,</i>

31:47.250 --> 31:51.208
<i>where the victim was last seen</i>
<i>between 4:05 and 4:10 p.m.</i>

31:52.833 --> 31:55.000
He claims not to have seen the child,

31:55.083 --> 31:56.666
but places himself driving past

31:56.750 --> 31:59.791
at the same time the child was
observed by other witnesses,

32:00.333 --> 32:02.083
including those on a passing bus.

32:04.250 --> 32:05.958
<i>That bus wasn't taking passengers.</i>

32:07.083 --> 32:09.958
<i>It drives through</i>
<i>the underpass at 4:15 p.m.</i>

32:11.541 --> 32:14.375
<i>A number of witnesses</i>
<i>on that bus saw the boy.</i>

32:15.041 --> 32:16.958
<i>He was waiting by the side of the road</i>

32:17.625 --> 32:19.416
<i>with a man standing behind him,</i>

32:20.625 --> 32:22.750
<i>leaning against a pillar of the underpass,</i>

32:23.291 --> 32:26.083
<i>his leg bent behind him like a stork.</i>

32:29.500 --> 32:31.791
<i>A second bus passes at 4:18 p.m.</i>

32:34.458 --> 32:37.916
There are no sightings of either the boy
or the man from that last bus

32:38.916 --> 32:40.708
which means in those three minutes,

32:41.333 --> 32:45.375
between 4:15 to 4:18 p.m., he's taken.

33:05.541 --> 33:08.666
<i>He claimed that a camera,</i>
<i>angled at the road,</i>

33:08.750 --> 33:11.083
<i>would've seen his car</i>
<i>driving through the site.</i>

33:12.333 --> 33:14.291
<i>That camera was not operational.</i>

33:15.625 --> 33:17.750
He-- He's only placed himself at the scene

33:19.041 --> 33:21.583
because he thinks
he was recorded passing through it.

33:23.666 --> 33:26.708
<i>P28 claimed he drove</i>
<i>through the site without stopping,</i>

33:26.791 --> 33:29.666
<i>proceeding directly to</i>
<i>the home of an elderly friend</i>

33:29.750 --> 33:31.666
<i>with whom he spent the next half hour.</i>

33:32.250 --> 33:35.166
<i>The alibi no longer resides</i>
<i>at her home address.</i>

33:37.166 --> 33:39.625
<i>When asked why</i>
<i>he hadn't raised the alibi earlier,</i>

33:39.708 --> 33:43.291
<i>P28 stated it was because</i>
<i>he did not want to upset her.</i>

33:47.916 --> 33:48.875
Hello, Mari.

33:50.791 --> 33:51.708
How are you today?

33:56.000 --> 33:59.208
What was the period of time
you were hoping to talk to her about?

33:59.291 --> 34:00.416
We can't discuss that.

34:03.250 --> 34:06.916
He claimed to have been with her
between 4:10 and 4:45 p.m.,

34:07.875 --> 34:09.916
however, she's unable to confirm that.

34:12.875 --> 34:15.333
Forensic investigators
attended his property

34:15.416 --> 34:16.500
in the days following

34:16.583 --> 34:18.750
and conducted an examination
of his vehicle.

34:19.875 --> 34:22.750
Tape lifts were taken through
the interior of the car.

34:24.625 --> 34:26.333
There's no record of the results here.

34:27.125 --> 34:30.666
<i>Senior police considered him</i>
<i>an unlikely suspect regardless,</i>

34:31.333 --> 34:34.083
<i>as he did not drive</i>
<i>the "boxy black vehicle"</i>

34:34.166 --> 34:36.500
<i>sighted by multiple witnesses</i>
<i>at the scene.</i>

34:36.583 --> 34:38.333
<i>The conclusions were a lack of evidence</i>

34:38.416 --> 34:41.458
<i>and insufficient time for him</i>
<i>to have abducted the child</i>

34:41.541 --> 34:43.500
<i>and returned home by 5:30</i>

34:43.583 --> 34:45.583
to what he stated he'd been doing.

34:45.666 --> 34:46.666
Which was what?

34:48.166 --> 34:49.000
Cleaning.

34:53.666 --> 34:57.625
You know, when I was a kid, I used to ride
the cane trains all the fuckin' time.

35:00.958 --> 35:02.583
Out of my fuckin' head, I was.

35:08.625 --> 35:10.583
I never felt more free until now, mate.

35:17.541 --> 35:21.083
I reckon this is what
fuckin' real dreams are made of.

35:29.333 --> 35:30.208
You know Paul?

35:31.125 --> 35:35.375
When I first met him, I…
I didn't even fuckin' trust him.

35:35.458 --> 35:39.166
I thought he was a fuckin'
reporter or something, you know?

35:41.083 --> 35:43.291
With all the fuckin' questions
he was asking.

35:44.833 --> 35:46.500
That cunt couldn't be a reporter.

35:47.791 --> 35:49.166
He can hardly fuckin' read.

35:56.958 --> 35:57.958
It's true.

35:59.416 --> 36:01.000
He's a fuckin' dumb dummy.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.250
-Done?
-No, not yet.

36:30.750 --> 36:31.625
Hey.

36:33.708 --> 36:34.875
This is Henry.

36:40.041 --> 36:41.250
Here you go.

36:41.333 --> 36:42.208
Good?

36:43.041 --> 36:44.625
-Yeah, you'll let me know?
-Yep.

36:51.166 --> 36:52.041
So…

36:52.750 --> 36:54.833
Meeting him is a marker of trust.

36:54.916 --> 36:57.250
It means you've been brought further in.

36:57.875 --> 36:59.875
He's a detective senior sergeant.

37:00.666 --> 37:02.916
His influence goes right up
through the ranks.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.666
If you ever see him out,
don't approach him,

37:05.750 --> 37:06.666
don't talk to him.

37:07.583 --> 37:09.541
He's hooked us up with an arms contact.

37:10.250 --> 37:12.458
<i>We've got to go and meet him out of town.</i>

37:18.583 --> 37:22.083
Two 1911s,
two Berettas, three Glocks.

37:22.166 --> 37:24.000
I can do the lot for, like, 12…

37:41.416 --> 37:42.458
I like firearms.

37:43.041 --> 37:44.208
I used to collect them.

37:45.166 --> 37:47.375
Now it's antiques,
little trinkets like this.

37:49.416 --> 37:50.458
Oh.

37:54.416 --> 37:55.708
Who's Rylett?

37:57.125 --> 37:58.458
-Rylett?
-Mm.

37:59.375 --> 38:02.958
Oh. Rylett Holdings. Yeah,
I used to work for them back east.

38:07.291 --> 38:08.500
<i>This is Kate Rylett.</i>

38:08.583 --> 38:13.250
<i>I'm after any archival video material</i>
<i>related to P28, Henry Teague.</i>

38:19.708 --> 38:21.916
<i>What was your relationship?</i>

38:22.791 --> 38:24.291
<i>We met through church.</i>

38:27.708 --> 38:29.625
<i>Why have you come forward?</i>

38:30.750 --> 38:34.541
<i>Well, I don't…</i>
<i>I don't know about this case, but, um…</i>

38:36.791 --> 38:40.041
<i>but if a child's gone missing</i>
<i>and he was in the area, then I…</i>

38:42.166 --> 38:43.208
<i>think that…</i>

38:45.333 --> 38:47.250
<i>You think he was involved?</i>

38:48.458 --> 38:49.458
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:51.250 --> 38:55.041
<i>He drove us into the forest</i>
<i>this one night, um…</i>

38:56.541 --> 39:00.375
<i>And told me to get out</i>
<i>and pretend that I didn't know him.</i>

39:00.875 --> 39:02.708
<i>And… and then he's…</i>

39:03.791 --> 39:07.791
<i>He's just driven off,</i>
<i>and he's just left me there. Uh…</i>

39:08.583 --> 39:11.916
<i>Then he's… He circled back round,</i>

39:12.625 --> 39:14.708
<i>he's pulled over to talk me into the car,</i>

39:15.250 --> 39:17.833
<i>and then when I climbed in, he's…</i>

39:18.541 --> 39:19.791
<i>Ugh.</i>

39:21.708 --> 39:25.625
<i>He said, "You should…</i>
<i>You should be more careful who you trust."</i>

39:25.708 --> 39:29.125
-<i>And then what happened?</i>

39:35.291 --> 39:37.375
I used to be
a tow-truck driver, you know?

39:38.458 --> 39:42.166
Take the wrecks to… to be destroyed
down at the shredding yard.

39:43.625 --> 39:44.750
If you ever needed to,

39:44.833 --> 39:47.958
that would be a very good place
to get rid of a body, you know.

39:50.333 --> 39:51.541
If you ever needed to.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.125
They don't check the cars?

39:54.666 --> 39:55.625
Nah.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.500
A lot of fuckin' crosses out here, mate.

40:04.458 --> 40:07.875
I used to be a member of
the church, back east. Yeah.

40:09.291 --> 40:10.833
A charismatic revival.

40:11.625 --> 40:12.708
Do you know the type?

40:14.666 --> 40:15.500
Yeah.

40:15.583 --> 40:18.375
You shake and you flap about.

40:19.416 --> 40:21.375
Then they go into fucking convulsions.

40:37.833 --> 40:38.750
Eh.

40:39.916 --> 40:42.083
I had a falling out
with the pastor, though.

40:43.916 --> 40:46.666
He said there was
no such thing as an unforgivable sin.

40:48.458 --> 40:50.916
All sins could be forgiven.

40:53.041 --> 40:55.958
"That's not what it says in the Bible,"
I fuckin' told him.

40:57.791 --> 41:00.791
Standing up there,
preaching things that aren't fuckin' true.

41:01.750 --> 41:02.833
Fuckin' lying.

41:05.958 --> 41:09.416
<i>When we get there,</i>
<i>I'll need to go off and meet our contact.</i>

41:10.250 --> 41:12.833
<i>You just hold there at the caravan park</i>

41:12.916 --> 41:15.291
<i>till I come back for you.</i>

41:19.791 --> 41:23.041
Your recording device failed.
Take this one and hand me yours.

41:25.208 --> 41:28.250
You guys, you, you need to
back off further, all right?

41:28.333 --> 41:30.541
You're following way too close.

41:30.875 --> 41:32.083
All right. You all right?

41:32.166 --> 41:34.041
You just…

41:35.250 --> 41:37.666
Just… just run me through
the fuckin' scenario.

41:37.750 --> 41:39.291
There's no scenario, mate.

41:41.208 --> 41:45.166
Local police were alerted to activity
at the warehouse we planned to use.

41:45.250 --> 41:46.250
We had to clear out.

41:48.708 --> 41:49.583
Fuck.

41:53.458 --> 41:54.750
Henry!

41:54.833 --> 41:55.916
-Buddy.
-Henry!

41:56.500 --> 41:57.666
Got to move out, mate.

41:57.750 --> 41:59.875
Hurry up. Get your shit. Serious.

41:59.958 --> 42:01.916
-Quick! Anything else here?
-Yeah.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.375
-No.
-All right.

42:29.125 --> 42:30.125
Do you, um…

42:31.750 --> 42:33.583
Do you want to come up to the house?

42:34.375 --> 42:36.416
The missus is out of town at the moment.

43:02.791 --> 43:03.791
Nice.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.583
Back in a sec.

43:44.791 --> 43:46.500
What does your missus do?

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Oh, she…

43:49.875 --> 43:51.875
She suffers with anxiety and depression.

43:57.625 --> 44:00.125
She doesn't really leave
the house that much.

44:00.208 --> 44:01.250
Oh, yeah?

44:20.041 --> 44:23.125
Bought that with the money
you paid me for the work last week.

44:31.958 --> 44:33.708
-Where did you grow up?

44:35.458 --> 44:36.791
A lot of army bases.

44:45.250 --> 44:47.250
I'm the black sheep of the family, mate.

44:49.458 --> 44:51.833
They're ashamed of me.
Can't fuckin' stand me.

44:52.750 --> 44:53.625
Why's that?

44:59.041 --> 45:00.041
I don't know.

45:08.458 --> 45:09.875
How old are you, Mark?

45:09.958 --> 45:11.083
Forty-six.

45:13.291 --> 45:15.000
-Nearly 50, eh?
-Yeah.

45:15.708 --> 45:16.625
Old man.

45:19.333 --> 45:20.166
Huh.

45:24.625 --> 45:26.750
What kind of music do you listen to, Mark?

45:28.791 --> 45:31.333
I don't really… listen to music.

45:33.666 --> 45:34.541
How do you mean?

45:36.666 --> 45:38.750
Well, I'm not really a song person.

45:42.541 --> 45:43.708
Yeah.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.500
Hey, listen, um,

45:49.166 --> 45:53.541
there's preparations
for something that's happening,

45:55.083 --> 45:58.333
and I've talked about bringing you in.

45:59.083 --> 46:01.625
But it would mean travelling out of town,

46:01.708 --> 46:04.458
like, interstate, if you're up for it.

46:05.458 --> 46:07.750
I'm there, mate. I'm there.

46:08.791 --> 46:10.375
Brilliant. All right.

46:10.958 --> 46:11.958
I'll let 'em know.

46:15.041 --> 46:17.541
It's good to have a friend, Mark,
you know.

46:19.333 --> 46:21.083
Someone you can chat to.

46:22.375 --> 46:24.375
-Yeah.
-It's been a while.

46:28.208 --> 46:30.458
We see through to the other side,
you and me.

46:30.708 --> 46:32.166
That's why we get on so well.

46:34.791 --> 46:36.666
Yeah. You're doin' good.

46:39.916 --> 46:41.875
Oh, fuck, I'm tired, man.

46:43.666 --> 46:46.416
I have a long drive back.
I'm going to have to head off.

46:47.250 --> 46:48.208
Sorry.

46:50.291 --> 46:52.458
Um… It's a nice place.

46:52.541 --> 46:53.916
-Mark, wait.

48:22.583 --> 48:25.416
-<i>Hey. What are you fuckin' doing?</i>

48:27.333 --> 48:28.541
All right, enough.

48:30.833 --> 48:33.958
All right, one time. That's it, all right?

48:34.041 --> 48:35.958
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Shake my hand.

48:36.458 --> 48:38.125
-Promise.
-All right. okay.

48:38.208 --> 48:40.041
I'm gonna-- How much do I gotta count?

48:40.583 --> 48:41.416
Uh…

48:42.250 --> 48:44.000
-Forty.
-Forty.

48:44.083 --> 48:46.125
Thirty? Thirty. I'll count to 30.

48:46.208 --> 48:50.250
One, two, three,

48:51.333 --> 48:55.375
four, five, six,

48:56.625 --> 49:00.583
seven, eight, nine,

49:02.083 --> 49:03.958
ten, eleven…

49:11.166 --> 49:13.041
You in here? Huh?

49:15.791 --> 49:16.708
Buddy?

49:17.583 --> 49:18.666
I'm gonna tickle ya.

49:20.833 --> 49:22.666
I'm gonna getcha!

49:25.458 --> 49:26.708
Fuck are you?

49:28.500 --> 49:29.458
Fuck.

49:30.291 --> 49:31.208
Mate?

49:32.958 --> 49:34.416
Mate, I'm fucking serious!

49:34.500 --> 49:36.458
Call out now if you can hear me.

49:37.791 --> 49:38.750
Mate!

49:39.833 --> 49:41.833
Hey, where are you? Mate!

49:43.000 --> 49:45.125
-Mate!
-I'm here!

49:47.166 --> 49:50.125
-What are you doing out here?
-You said hide.

49:50.208 --> 49:52.041
You cannot come out here.

49:52.125 --> 49:54.875
You don't go out here. What did I say?

49:54.958 --> 49:56.583
-Come here.
-You told me to hide.

49:57.083 --> 50:00.208
What did I say?
You don't go outside. Get in the house.

50:09.791 --> 50:11.166
Fucking feel this, cunt.

50:12.208 --> 50:13.416
Feel the wind in me hair.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.166
I can feel the wind in me hair.

50:19.250 --> 50:21.083
What is this fuckin' person doing?

50:23.000 --> 50:24.708
What's the matter with you, you fuck?

50:24.791 --> 50:26.458
Get out there, you fuckin' idiot.

50:26.541 --> 50:30.041
What the fucking matter with you?
Oi! Get the fuck out!

50:30.125 --> 50:31.875
-Fuckin' drive, cunt!

50:33.250 --> 50:34.208
Fuck!

50:34.291 --> 50:35.583
-Fuck.

50:35.666 --> 50:36.666
Fuckin' hell.

50:45.333 --> 50:46.833
-Fuck.

50:51.750 --> 50:54.458
-<i>Police, fire or ambulance?</i>
-Ambulance.

50:54.541 --> 50:57.625
<i>What's the situation there, sir?</i>
<i>Can you describe it for me?</i>

50:57.708 --> 50:59.333
-Uh, car crash.

50:59.416 --> 51:04.208
Uh, corner of Ellery and…
Fuck, I don't know.

51:06.125 --> 51:06.958
<i>All right, sir.</i>

51:07.041 --> 51:09.458
<i>Can I have your name</i>
<i>and a contact number please?</i>

51:10.250 --> 51:12.083
-Fuck.

51:12.166 --> 51:14.416
-Henry!
-Sit down here. Sit down.

51:14.500 --> 51:15.416
Yeah.

51:15.500 --> 51:17.125
Henry, come on. We've got to go.

51:20.000 --> 51:20.833
Henry!

51:29.416 --> 51:31.250
Do you want to come up to the house?

51:31.333 --> 51:32.625
No, no, no.

51:34.083 --> 51:38.000
They're… they're putting
the final pieces in place

51:38.083 --> 51:39.750
to fly us across to Victoria.

51:40.458 --> 51:42.791
-What?
-What's that noise?

51:55.458 --> 51:56.625
They're putting the final--

51:56.708 --> 51:58.791
I've never been to Victoria.

52:03.791 --> 52:06.625
Okay, I'm just gonna
need you to lay low.

52:06.708 --> 52:09.083
That's all…
I'm fuckin' tired, man.

52:10.250 --> 52:12.625
All right? I'll call you later
with the details, okay?

52:27.291 --> 52:28.416
No, no.

52:38.291 --> 52:39.833
I'm just fuckin' with you.

52:40.791 --> 52:41.916
I know.

52:43.500 --> 52:44.375
I know.

53:18.458 --> 53:22.875
<i>Are you, um,</i>
<i>dealing with any increased irritability?</i>

53:23.791 --> 53:25.041
-Stress?
-<i>Nah.</i>

53:25.125 --> 53:27.541
<i>Nothing that</i>
<i>you've perceived in yourself?</i>

53:27.625 --> 53:28.583
<i>No.</i>

53:29.541 --> 53:30.625
<i>Okay.</i>

53:30.708 --> 53:33.333
<i>Any physical discomfort,</i>
<i>anything likewise?</i>

53:33.416 --> 53:34.333
<i>No.</i>

53:36.333 --> 53:38.458
<i>Any symptoms of depression?</i>

53:38.541 --> 53:39.458
<i>No.</i>

53:39.541 --> 53:40.958
<i>How about anxiety?</i>

53:41.041 --> 53:43.125
-Are you feeling anxious?
-No. No.

53:44.541 --> 53:47.625
And, um, how about any…
any thoughts of self-harm?

53:48.791 --> 53:49.958
No.

53:50.875 --> 53:55.041
Look, um, I do have, um, it noted

53:55.125 --> 53:57.291
that you are dealing
with some sleep issues.

53:57.375 --> 53:59.333
Might it be linked to
your work with WA Police,

53:59.416 --> 54:00.416
or is that more personal?

54:00.500 --> 54:01.500
Nah.

54:03.458 --> 54:05.333
More to do with WA Police
or more personal?

54:05.416 --> 54:06.541
Neither.

54:08.208 --> 54:10.416
Mark, look, the reason that you're here

54:10.500 --> 54:14.291
is I've been told you're being placed
in a difficult work situation.

54:14.875 --> 54:16.958
I've been asked to discuss that with you.

54:19.625 --> 54:22.208
You know, a person in this profession

54:23.041 --> 54:25.125
goes through enough…
goes through enough trauma

54:25.208 --> 54:27.041
that the aggregation of that trauma,

54:27.125 --> 54:29.291
-the amount of it, is overwhelming.
-Mm-hmm.

54:29.375 --> 54:31.500
There's not always an isolated incident

54:32.375 --> 54:33.958
or a situation that--

54:34.041 --> 54:36.250
I don't know what you're talking about.

54:36.333 --> 54:38.666
If you need to take some time off work,

54:38.750 --> 54:40.875
there will be other people
that can take your shifts.

54:47.625 --> 54:50.041
Look, I need to talk to you
about the other night

54:50.125 --> 54:51.625
outside the front of my house.

54:53.541 --> 54:55.666
-Uh, no, Henry, listen--
-No, Mark, please.

54:58.375 --> 55:00.375
I used to watch a lot of porn, you know?

55:01.666 --> 55:03.291
Uh, amputees.

55:05.166 --> 55:06.291
That was my thing.

55:06.375 --> 55:11.000
You know, people with no…
no arms, no fuckin' legs.

55:13.583 --> 55:15.625
I don't know what it is about you, Mark.

55:17.416 --> 55:19.583
You… you remind me of an amputee.

55:21.250 --> 55:22.708
You keep talking like that,

55:22.791 --> 55:25.875
I'll have to take you down
to the fuckin' watchhouse.

55:29.458 --> 55:30.583
What was that?

55:33.041 --> 55:34.625
Uh-- Uh…

55:34.708 --> 55:36.500
I've got a black lake in my eye!

57:26.208 --> 57:29.416
<i>You need to know that</i>
<i>I've told them that we cannot replace you.</i>

57:29.958 --> 57:32.375
<i>You've been on for five and a half months.</i>

57:32.458 --> 57:35.041
We can't replicate that
and we can't undo that work.

57:38.375 --> 57:42.291
Flying you down to Melbourne
in the coming days.

57:42.375 --> 57:43.958
Victoria are providing coverts.

57:45.541 --> 57:47.041
That'll take the pressure off.

57:47.750 --> 57:50.333
We've heard nothing
about the assault in the NT

57:50.625 --> 57:54.500
and Forensics have come back
with the test results from his vehicle.

57:54.583 --> 57:57.083
The tape lifts they took
were never tested.

57:58.125 --> 58:00.833
They were submitted to the lab
where they were set aside.

58:01.333 --> 58:02.708
They tested them yesterday.

58:03.708 --> 58:05.583
Testing confirms no physical evidence

58:05.666 --> 58:08.000
of any other presence
in the fucking vehicle.

58:10.625 --> 58:11.791
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

58:13.208 --> 58:16.166
They noted that this,
in and of itself, is not conclusive

58:17.291 --> 58:19.541
and that at the time
the tape lifts were taken

58:19.625 --> 58:21.500
the person of interest was compliant,

58:21.583 --> 58:23.791
cooperative and understanding
of the process.

58:27.750 --> 58:29.458
We have absolutely nothing on him.

58:50.791 --> 58:53.833
How's, uh… How's your mum?

58:57.500 --> 58:59.166
She said to not talk about it.

59:00.416 --> 59:01.541
Talk about what?

59:02.041 --> 59:03.083
How she is.

59:09.875 --> 59:11.666
-Hey, mate.
-Yeah?

59:11.750 --> 59:14.750
I'm not gonna be able to
take you for a few days, okay?

59:14.833 --> 59:15.666
Okay.

59:15.750 --> 59:17.750
-So you tell your mum?
-Okay.

59:26.625 --> 59:28.208
There's a boy out there.

59:30.875 --> 59:32.041
Alone.

59:33.791 --> 59:35.375
Waiting to be found.

59:40.041 --> 59:41.583
And you know what he's saying?

59:44.916 --> 59:46.041
"Where am I?"

59:46.583 --> 59:47.583
"Where am I?"

59:50.083 --> 59:51.583
"Where the fuck am I?"

1:00:43.125 --> 1:00:44.083
Henry.

1:00:44.708 --> 1:00:46.875
I heard this is
your first time in Victoria.

1:00:48.791 --> 1:00:51.500
Must've done something right
to be sent interstate.

1:00:52.291 --> 1:00:54.541
We're making a collection from a contact.

1:00:55.250 --> 1:00:58.291
You're taking it back with you to WA,
that's why you're here.

1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.000
Mark.

1:01:02.833 --> 1:01:03.833
Mark!

1:01:05.291 --> 1:01:06.583
John's here in town.

1:01:23.166 --> 1:01:24.041
Take this.

1:01:26.250 --> 1:01:27.708
-You wait here.
-Hey, Mark.

1:01:27.791 --> 1:01:29.708
-Follow me through here.

1:01:33.083 --> 1:01:35.000
What the fuck's happened to this shit?

1:01:49.458 --> 1:01:51.708
-Through here, mate. You all right?

1:01:52.333 --> 1:01:53.291
Yep.

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.416
Victoria have provided John.

1:01:56.333 --> 1:01:58.583
He'll be leading
the final part of the operation.

1:01:58.666 --> 1:02:01.208
But my concern is that
he's too direct for Henry.

1:02:01.791 --> 1:02:04.166
I need you to talk to him
about Henry's anxiety.

1:02:05.250 --> 1:02:09.000
So we've gone after him
and we're racing down this corridor

1:02:09.083 --> 1:02:12.041
and he's locked himself in
so we thought, "Well, all right."

1:02:12.666 --> 1:02:15.083
"Wait for you to ask
to be nicely let out."

1:02:15.166 --> 1:02:16.625
-John.

1:02:17.125 --> 1:02:18.708
-Do you have a minute?
-Yeah.

1:02:18.791 --> 1:02:21.375
Uh, Mark here's been
leading the operation in WA.

1:02:21.458 --> 1:02:23.000
Be good to talk to him about--

1:02:23.083 --> 1:02:24.875
Sorry, what was your name again?

1:02:24.958 --> 1:02:25.791
Mark.

1:02:27.083 --> 1:02:29.291
Yeah, but that's not
your actual name, is it?

1:02:29.375 --> 1:02:32.000
I mean they did tell you
not to use your actual name?

1:02:32.083 --> 1:02:33.291
Yeah.

1:02:33.375 --> 1:02:35.916
So what's your real name?

1:02:40.333 --> 1:02:41.583
What's your name?

1:02:41.666 --> 1:02:44.166
-Well, it's not Mark. That's taken.

1:02:46.541 --> 1:02:49.166
Sorry. I'm just fucking around with you.
I'm sorry.

1:02:49.250 --> 1:02:51.625
I'll be with you in a sec.
I've just got to…

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:53.958
So…

1:02:54.041 --> 1:02:55.333
He's a fuckin' arsehole.

1:02:55.416 --> 1:02:57.583
We've got him here.

1:02:57.666 --> 1:03:00.333
We picked him up,
take him down the hallway…

1:03:00.416 --> 1:03:05.125
We've been taking out insurance policies,
putting it through our claims officer.

1:03:06.500 --> 1:03:08.291
Which puts it in our system…

1:03:08.375 --> 1:03:09.375
Mark.

1:03:10.333 --> 1:03:12.041
What do you reckon is in the case?

1:03:13.458 --> 1:03:14.916
You just have to trust him.

1:03:17.625 --> 1:03:20.916
Where is my water?
Where's my water?

1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:22.791
Where is my water?

1:03:23.416 --> 1:03:25.000
Bloody hell!

1:03:25.083 --> 1:03:28.041
No, no, no, no!

1:03:28.833 --> 1:03:30.291
-It's him.
-Who?

1:03:30.375 --> 1:03:31.291
John.

1:03:40.083 --> 1:03:41.875
-You all right, Mark?
-Yeah.

1:03:42.416 --> 1:03:43.875
-Flight sorted?
-Yep.

1:03:45.166 --> 1:03:46.125
How are you, Henry?

1:03:46.208 --> 1:03:47.166
Yeah.

1:03:48.666 --> 1:03:51.833
It's really… nice to meet you,
John, yeah. Thanks--

1:03:51.916 --> 1:03:53.083
I'm not John.

1:03:54.083 --> 1:03:55.208
He's over there.

1:03:55.791 --> 1:03:59.458
He wants you to write down
your name and date of birth.

1:04:02.791 --> 1:04:04.041
Um, yeah.

1:04:28.541 --> 1:04:30.541
He said to write down your other name.

1:04:33.708 --> 1:04:36.583
-My other name?
-Yeah. Your other name.

1:05:19.583 --> 1:05:22.791
-I changed the name years ago.
-Why didn't you fuckin' tell me?

1:05:22.875 --> 1:05:24.791
What's he want to know the name for?

1:05:24.875 --> 1:05:26.500
Why didn't you fuckin' tell me?

1:05:26.583 --> 1:05:28.875
They'll give your name
to a police contact,

1:05:28.958 --> 1:05:30.333
run a background check on you.

1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:34.250
We all have to get cleared.
Make sure we won't draw attention.

1:05:34.333 --> 1:05:36.416
Yeah, yeah,
don't fuckin' worry about it.

1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:38.166
I remember sitting where you are,

1:05:38.250 --> 1:05:40.500
thinking I'd never be let in
with the shit I'd done.

1:05:41.083 --> 1:05:42.916
-John wants to see you.
-What?

1:05:43.708 --> 1:05:45.416
John. He wants to talk to you now.

1:06:01.083 --> 1:06:04.916
I heard about you. Henry.

1:06:06.333 --> 1:06:07.541
Whatever your name is.

1:06:08.750 --> 1:06:11.208
You've got to be honest with us,
all right?

1:06:11.833 --> 1:06:13.333
I-- Yeah.

1:06:13.875 --> 1:06:15.833
I changed… I changed the name years--

1:06:15.916 --> 1:06:17.166
I don't give a fuck.

1:06:18.958 --> 1:06:19.916
No.

1:06:23.666 --> 1:06:25.375
-What are you staring at?
-Nothin'.

1:06:27.375 --> 1:06:29.708
Then why are you still standing there?

1:06:39.458 --> 1:06:40.458
Thanks.

1:06:41.333 --> 1:06:44.291
Right. They've got us in different places.
Don't leave the hotel.

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:47.041
There's nothing else I haven't told you,
apart from the name.

1:06:47.125 --> 1:06:49.541
-Nothing else I know about, at least.
-All right.

1:06:49.625 --> 1:06:51.333
Don't leave the hotel, Henry.

1:07:20.208 --> 1:07:22.666
<i>I met this woman down</i>
<i>in the hotel bar last night.</i>

1:07:25.458 --> 1:07:26.916
<i>Brought her back to the room.</i>

1:07:30.541 --> 1:07:32.791
<i>You know what she told me before she left?</i>

1:07:34.625 --> 1:07:35.458
Hm.

1:07:36.541 --> 1:07:38.458
<i>"I'll never forget you, Henry."</i>

1:07:44.541 --> 1:07:48.041
Fuckin' hope they've got enough ink
in the printer to print out my record.

1:07:48.125 --> 1:07:50.291
Eh, you don't need to worry about it.

1:07:52.541 --> 1:07:55.000
Ah, there's been nothing
in 20 years, mate.

1:08:24.375 --> 1:08:26.916
There were no records
of an assault in the NT

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:28.208
under Henry Teague.

1:08:28.916 --> 1:08:31.500
They were filed under his
former name, Peter Morley.

1:08:32.708 --> 1:08:34.791
I provided them with the information,

1:08:35.750 --> 1:08:36.750
but it was misfiled.

1:08:39.291 --> 1:08:40.416
Jesus Christ.

1:08:45.416 --> 1:08:48.458
<i>I can't, uh,</i>
<i>take your call at the moment.</i>

1:08:48.541 --> 1:08:52.083
<i>If you leave me a message,</i>
<i>I'll endeavor to call you back later.</i>

1:08:58.250 --> 1:08:59.208
Henry?

1:09:02.958 --> 1:09:03.875
Fuck.

1:09:11.458 --> 1:09:13.125
-I've lost him.
-<i>What?</i>

1:09:13.208 --> 1:09:15.875
-I've fuckin' lost him.
<i>-Did he follow you back?</i>

1:09:15.958 --> 1:09:18.458
Uh, no, I don't know,
but I don't think so.

1:09:18.541 --> 1:09:19.458
<i>Fuck!</i>

1:09:20.125 --> 1:09:22.625
<i>Uh… Listen, Mark.</i>

1:09:23.875 --> 1:09:26.125
<i>We can't put out an alert. You know that.</i>

1:09:28.916 --> 1:09:31.041
<i>There… there can't be a follow vehicle.</i>

1:09:31.125 --> 1:09:33.708
<i>I can't put out an alert.</i>
<i>You have to try and find him.</i>

1:09:33.791 --> 1:09:34.708
What?

1:09:34.791 --> 1:09:37.166
<i>You're gonna have to</i>
<i>try to find him, mate.</i>

1:09:37.250 --> 1:09:38.750
<i>Only issue is the alibi.</i>

1:09:38.833 --> 1:09:41.708
<i>Her daughter worked at a local RSL</i>
<i>at the time of the abduction.</i>

1:09:42.416 --> 1:09:44.958
<i>She said her mum was often there,</i>
<i>playing the machines.</i>

1:09:45.041 --> 1:09:47.833
<i>Don't have security camera</i>
<i>footage dating back to 2002?</i>

1:09:48.500 --> 1:09:49.833
Not back that far.

1:09:52.416 --> 1:09:54.583
Do you keep records of your sign-in books?

1:09:54.666 --> 1:09:56.875
If she was a regular,
she wouldn't have to sign.

1:09:56.958 --> 1:09:58.750
What do you do for the regulars?

1:09:58.833 --> 1:10:01.000
We used to have a loyalty program

1:10:01.083 --> 1:10:03.125
where members could scan their cards

1:10:03.208 --> 1:10:05.083
and the machine
would record their numbers.

1:10:05.166 --> 1:10:06.833
How would we track down--

1:10:07.625 --> 1:10:08.458
Sorry.

1:10:08.541 --> 1:10:11.708
<i>They shall not</i>
<i>grow old, as we who are left grow old.</i>

1:10:12.333 --> 1:10:15.583
<i>Age shall not weary them,</i>
<i>nor the years condemn.</i>

1:10:17.916 --> 1:10:20.500
<i>At the going down of the sun</i>
<i>and in the morning,</i>

1:10:20.583 --> 1:10:21.833
<i>we shall remember them.</i>

1:10:21.916 --> 1:10:23.250
We shall remember them.

1:10:23.333 --> 1:10:25.750
-We shall remember them.
-We shall remember them.

1:10:35.458 --> 1:10:38.833
-<i>Lest we forget.</i>
-We'll have her number on file,

1:10:38.916 --> 1:10:41.750
-but the machines have been out of use--
-Where are they?

1:10:49.583 --> 1:10:51.250
What's the date you're after?

1:10:52.125 --> 1:10:54.500
The 12th May, 2002.

1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:36.875
<i>I'm sittin' here with</i>
<i>the missus and just had ourselves a roast.</i>

1:12:39.875 --> 1:12:41.333
<i>She says hello, by the way.</i>

1:12:42.958 --> 1:12:45.791
<i>"Hello, Mark," she's saying,</i>
<i>"Hello, Mark."</i>

1:12:46.375 --> 1:12:48.333
<i>Tell her I-- Tell her I said hi.</i>

1:12:50.375 --> 1:12:52.000
<i>Mate, where-- Where are you?</i>

1:12:52.083 --> 1:12:54.083
-Are you okay?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

1:12:55.458 --> 1:12:57.375
<i>I had to head out of town for a while.</i>

1:12:58.208 --> 1:13:01.750
<i>Well, why don't I talk</i>
<i>to the boys, we'll work out--</i>

1:13:03.666 --> 1:13:05.833
Yeah, he's anxious. He's unsettled.

1:13:07.916 --> 1:13:12.541
At this point, we feel that
we could lose him… at any time.

1:13:15.125 --> 1:13:16.583
<i>We need to get John out here</i>

1:13:17.375 --> 1:13:19.166
<i>and prepare to make the final push.</i>

1:13:25.791 --> 1:13:29.041
<i>The interstate job</i>
<i>was in preparation for a larger shipment.</i>

1:13:29.666 --> 1:13:32.416
Mark, here,
has put you forward for this, Henry.

1:13:33.416 --> 1:13:35.416
And this is just the start, mate.

1:13:35.500 --> 1:13:37.833
This is nothing.
This is just a fuckin' run.

1:13:37.916 --> 1:13:41.458
It's a remote airfield,
hour-and-a-half out of town.

1:13:42.250 --> 1:13:45.833
<i>John's concerned about security</i>
<i>and we need you to case the site.</i>

1:13:47.791 --> 1:13:51.375
<i>When the delivery is made,</i>
<i>you'll take 10% of the profit.</i>

1:13:51.458 --> 1:13:54.625
<i>To be clear, Henry,</i>
<i>that's over $100,000 each.</i>

1:14:06.333 --> 1:14:08.458
I've been, uh,
doing the security down here

1:14:08.541 --> 1:14:11.416
for nearly five years
and, uh, it never gets old.

1:14:13.291 --> 1:14:15.666
We're open to the public
on Sundays, by the way.

1:14:16.458 --> 1:14:18.958
Oh, right, yeah.
I might bring my boys out.

1:14:19.041 --> 1:14:20.791
Yeah, you should. They'd enjoy it.

1:14:24.375 --> 1:14:27.583
You like the look of that, eh?
You want to sit in the front seat?

1:14:28.750 --> 1:14:32.333
<i>I was 54 when I started.</i>
<i>I learned with my son.</i>

1:14:33.166 --> 1:14:36.541
<i>I had a fear of heights,</i>
<i>but, uh, when you get in here,</i>

1:14:36.625 --> 1:14:37.916
it feels really safe.

1:14:38.666 --> 1:14:40.458
-Yeah.
-It feels very safe.

1:14:41.041 --> 1:14:42.125
It does feel safe.

1:14:45.875 --> 1:14:47.416
How much are these worth?

1:14:48.208 --> 1:14:51.916
Well, there's, uh, no ceiling
in the price of planes

1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:55.375
but, uh, that, um… that plane back there,

1:14:56.333 --> 1:14:58.583
that's, uh, $60,000.

1:15:14.833 --> 1:15:16.708
We've disproved his alibi.

1:15:16.791 --> 1:15:18.875
She was on the machines at the local RSL.

1:15:19.750 --> 1:15:21.666
He couldn't have been
with her at the time.

1:15:23.333 --> 1:15:24.541
Where was he then?

1:15:27.291 --> 1:15:28.500
Not… not there.

1:15:32.375 --> 1:15:34.125
Have you seen the records from the NT?

1:15:34.208 --> 1:15:35.166
I'm reading them.

1:15:46.208 --> 1:15:47.500
Follow me, please.

1:16:25.958 --> 1:16:27.500
Take a seat. There's fine.

1:16:31.791 --> 1:16:33.291
I'm Detective Sergeant Cross.

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:36.791
I'm the controller for
the Covert and Specialist Operations crew.

1:16:37.333 --> 1:16:40.333
I'm here to inform you
that at the close of the coronial inquest

1:16:40.416 --> 1:16:42.666
there'll be a UC sitting
next to your person of interest

1:16:42.750 --> 1:16:45.166
-on his return to WA. This is Paul Emery.

1:16:46.083 --> 1:16:47.208
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:16:47.291 --> 1:16:49.625
The intention will be
for Paul to make contact

1:16:49.708 --> 1:16:51.333
with the POI on his return trip,

1:16:51.416 --> 1:16:54.041
see where that takes us
over a two-week period.

1:16:54.125 --> 1:16:57.000
I'm afraid, unless they decide
to take it further, that's…

1:16:58.416 --> 1:16:59.250
That's it.

1:17:00.583 --> 1:17:02.833
You're here to brief us
about his background.

1:17:02.916 --> 1:17:05.000
-Right. But he did it.
-Mm.

1:17:09.208 --> 1:17:12.416
And I know they've probably told
you he isn't worth the effort,

1:17:14.083 --> 1:17:15.083
but he did it.

1:17:16.333 --> 1:17:19.125
Well,
we've only just been allocated this.

1:17:20.583 --> 1:17:22.875
Tell us what we can use
to get him to talk.

1:17:24.250 --> 1:17:25.916
<i>Is this Peter Morley?</i>

1:17:26.666 --> 1:17:27.541
<i>No.</i>

1:17:28.083 --> 1:17:31.166
Is this Peter Morley,
otherwise known as Henry Peter Teague?

1:17:32.666 --> 1:17:34.083
<i>Who's this?</i>

1:17:34.166 --> 1:17:35.375
My name's Kate Rylett.

1:17:36.458 --> 1:17:38.791
I'm a detective senior constable
in Queensland.

1:17:39.625 --> 1:17:42.000
<i>As the detectives would've informed you,</i>

1:17:42.083 --> 1:17:46.250
<i>you've been summonsed to appear</i>
<i>at a coronial inquest in Queensland…</i>

1:17:46.333 --> 1:17:47.250
Henry Teague.

1:17:47.333 --> 1:17:52.166
<i>…into the suspected abduction</i>
<i>and murder of James Liston in 2002.</i>

1:17:53.666 --> 1:17:55.583
<i>I'm going to give you my phone number.</i>

1:17:56.125 --> 1:17:58.791
<i>I'll be your point of contact</i>
<i>from here on.</i>

1:17:58.875 --> 1:18:00.541
<i>And what if I refuse to come?</i>

1:18:00.625 --> 1:18:02.125
<i>If you don't want to come,</i>

1:18:02.208 --> 1:18:04.958
<i>the Queensland coroner</i>
<i>will issue a warrant</i>

1:18:05.041 --> 1:18:08.625
<i>for you to be taken into custody</i>
<i>and brought before the inquest.</i>

1:18:10.500 --> 1:18:13.375
<i>After the inquest,</i>
<i>we'll provide you with transport,</i>

1:18:14.333 --> 1:18:17.708
<i>as I understand that</i>
<i>you currently live in Western Australia.</i>

1:18:18.500 --> 1:18:21.375
<i>We'll ensure you're returned</i>
<i>to your place of residence,</i>

1:18:22.208 --> 1:18:24.583
<i>assuming you aren't required</i>
<i>to remain in Queensland</i>

1:18:24.666 --> 1:18:26.083
<i>at the close of the process.</i>

1:18:44.583 --> 1:18:48.166
<i>We've reviewed the brief</i>
<i>of evidence prepared by Detective Rylett.</i>

1:18:50.916 --> 1:18:52.083
Paul Emery?

1:18:52.166 --> 1:18:54.916
And we can see reason
to invest WA Pol resources

1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:56.458
in your person of interest.

1:18:56.916 --> 1:18:59.500
You'll remain here as a controller,
work with us on this.

1:19:00.625 --> 1:19:03.541
We're initiating an operation
that would mean introducing Mark here

1:19:03.625 --> 1:19:09.083
as part of a criminal organization
that can relocate people, erase histories…

1:19:10.666 --> 1:19:11.833
<i>…offer him a way out.</i>

1:19:15.791 --> 1:19:16.833
<i>It's dark.</i>

1:19:22.416 --> 1:19:24.083
I step out the front of my house.

1:19:29.916 --> 1:19:32.583
And I get this feeling
of lightness come over me.

1:19:34.166 --> 1:19:35.625
So I start to run.

1:19:36.666 --> 1:19:38.125
And then I'm up in the air

1:19:38.208 --> 1:19:42.041
and I'm flying over the back fences
and the houses that I grew up in.

1:19:46.458 --> 1:19:49.041
Fixed-wing licence costs $10,000.

1:19:50.375 --> 1:19:53.791
Two $5,000 payments.
Hey, figure how useful I'd be, Mark.

1:19:53.875 --> 1:19:56.416
-I-- I could be landing on airstrips

1:19:56.500 --> 1:19:58.958
all over the country, you know,
making deliveries.

1:20:04.541 --> 1:20:05.541
Yeah?

1:20:07.500 --> 1:20:10.166
All right. We'll head over
to the airfield after that.

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.000
We're going to go meet him out of town.

1:20:37.125 --> 1:20:37.958
Henry.

1:20:39.041 --> 1:20:40.125
Mark.

1:20:41.166 --> 1:20:42.333
-All right?
-Yeah, good.

1:20:42.833 --> 1:20:45.041
There's a car to be ditched.
Police have eyes on it.

1:20:45.125 --> 1:20:47.041
Make sure it's not parked where it is.

1:20:47.125 --> 1:20:48.458
I'll send you the details.

1:20:49.375 --> 1:20:52.208
Henry, there's, um…
I don't know if you're aware of this,

1:20:52.291 --> 1:20:54.750
but there's a subpoena
that's been issued for you.

1:20:55.833 --> 1:20:57.000
Nah.

1:20:57.083 --> 1:20:59.041
Yeah. Queensland Coroners Court.

1:20:59.125 --> 1:21:00.250
Are you aware of that?

1:21:01.791 --> 1:21:04.208
No, that's done. I went through that.

1:21:04.291 --> 1:21:06.125
No. This is different.

1:21:09.375 --> 1:21:11.000
Another inquest, is it?

1:21:12.166 --> 1:21:14.541
Yeah, apparently they have
some new information.

1:21:38.875 --> 1:21:41.125
-Can't let you hold on to that.
-Yep.

1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:43.000
Thanks.

1:21:46.083 --> 1:21:48.375
-Is that it?
-Yeah, that's it.

1:22:00.041 --> 1:22:01.041
What was that about?

1:22:01.125 --> 1:22:04.916
Uh… I was in the same area
when this person went missing.

1:22:05.583 --> 1:22:08.666
Police harassed me for it at the time.
Nothing came of it, so…

1:22:16.250 --> 1:22:17.625
How many times have I told you--

1:22:17.708 --> 1:22:21.208
If I'd known there could've been
another subpoena, I would've told you.

1:22:24.666 --> 1:22:25.666
What?

1:22:26.875 --> 1:22:28.375
Yeah. I am.

1:22:29.916 --> 1:22:30.916
What?

1:22:34.541 --> 1:22:35.416
Now?

1:22:38.416 --> 1:22:39.375
All right.

1:22:40.333 --> 1:22:42.541
Yeah, fuckin' all right. I'm doing it now.

1:22:42.625 --> 1:22:44.208
-What is it?

1:22:46.166 --> 1:22:47.500
I've got to turn around.

1:22:47.583 --> 1:22:48.416
Why?

1:22:49.125 --> 1:22:52.791
The airfield is, uh, not on tonight.

1:22:53.875 --> 1:22:55.125
John's in town.

1:22:55.791 --> 1:22:57.916
We're gonna go, um…
We're gonna go see him.

1:22:58.000 --> 1:22:59.791
It's probably about the airfield.

1:23:01.083 --> 1:23:02.583
Could be about the inquest.

1:23:03.208 --> 1:23:04.041
Huh?

1:23:05.041 --> 1:23:06.750
It could be about the inquest.

1:23:07.500 --> 1:23:08.916
I really don't fuckin' know.

1:24:15.458 --> 1:24:18.625
Okay. Well done.
And I'll give you a call this afternoon.

1:24:18.708 --> 1:24:20.500
-All right. Take care.
-Hey.

1:24:21.250 --> 1:24:22.291
-Hey.
-Hey, hey.

1:24:22.375 --> 1:24:23.750
-How you doin'?
-Good, good.

1:24:24.500 --> 1:24:27.458
-Uh, Henry, John. John, Henry.
-Yeah.

1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:29.416
-Good?
-You remember Henry?

1:24:29.500 --> 1:24:31.500
-All good?
-Yep.

1:24:31.583 --> 1:24:32.625
-All right
-Cool.

1:24:33.791 --> 1:24:35.166
-Take a seat.
-Yep.

1:24:35.250 --> 1:24:37.708
Yeah. Grab yourself a seat. There, there.

1:24:37.791 --> 1:24:39.708
Park yourself up the end there, Henry.

1:24:50.791 --> 1:24:53.625
So, I, uh, actually need to

1:24:54.625 --> 1:24:58.916
talk to you about this inquest
that you've heard told of…

1:24:59.875 --> 1:25:01.458
Heard tell of.

1:25:02.416 --> 1:25:05.250
I just need to… to sort that out.

1:25:07.666 --> 1:25:09.250
Yeah, uh…

1:25:11.166 --> 1:25:12.583
Got a criminal history.

1:25:13.666 --> 1:25:15.166
Stealing, uh, bit of violence.

1:25:16.625 --> 1:25:17.541
Fuckin' hell.

1:25:17.625 --> 1:25:19.416
-Uh…Hey, uh, let me…

1:25:19.500 --> 1:25:21.500
-Yeah, John, let me…
-Fuck's sake.

1:25:21.583 --> 1:25:23.291
Yeah, I'll sort it out. Hold on.

1:25:26.125 --> 1:25:27.041
I've got it.

1:25:35.583 --> 1:25:38.166
I… I did time for the violence, you know?

1:25:38.750 --> 1:25:40.416
I was upfront with Mark about that.

1:25:40.500 --> 1:25:42.833
-Wasn't I, mate?
-Yeah, absolutely.

1:25:44.500 --> 1:25:47.208
And I was questioned about
the other thing at the time.

1:25:47.916 --> 1:25:49.041
There we are.

1:25:49.750 --> 1:25:51.250
Nothing came of it.

1:25:51.916 --> 1:25:53.333
Sorry about that.

1:26:01.416 --> 1:26:02.583
Excuse us a minute.

1:26:22.208 --> 1:26:23.625
Where's he gone?

1:26:24.833 --> 1:26:26.125
I don't know.

1:26:29.666 --> 1:26:30.916
I'm gonna go

1:26:31.750 --> 1:26:33.250
see what's going on.

1:26:41.958 --> 1:26:42.833
John.

1:26:45.333 --> 1:26:46.625
You okay, mate?

1:26:47.583 --> 1:26:50.500
Wait outside. Wait in the hall.
I'll call you later.

1:26:52.625 --> 1:26:53.666
Hey, we're, um…

1:26:54.458 --> 1:26:56.708
-I should-- I should be here.
-Mark. Fuck off.

1:26:59.583 --> 1:27:00.750
Yeah. Yep.

1:27:07.166 --> 1:27:08.083
Mm.

1:27:09.541 --> 1:27:11.666
Yeah, all right, then. Um…

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.208
I'll see what he says.
I'll give him a call then.

1:27:15.291 --> 1:27:16.458
I'll be right back.

1:27:35.208 --> 1:27:36.791
Fuck! Fuck!

1:27:42.875 --> 1:27:43.708
What's going on?

1:27:43.791 --> 1:27:46.041
He's fuckin' falling to pieces
in there. Fuck!

1:27:46.125 --> 1:27:49.125
-Fuck. Hey, hey.

1:27:49.833 --> 1:27:51.916
-<i>…who tell me…</i>
-Fuck.

1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:55.041
<i>-…that you're the one who's responsible…</i>
-Fuck.

1:27:55.875 --> 1:27:59.625
<i>…so you have to tell me</i>
<i>what we need to take care of.</i>

1:27:59.708 --> 1:28:00.833
<i>Nothin' to tell.</i>

1:28:01.541 --> 1:28:06.625
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>What falls on you falls on all of us.</i>

1:28:07.708 --> 1:28:08.625
<i>All right?</i>

1:28:10.625 --> 1:28:14.500
So I received information this morning

1:28:16.333 --> 1:28:19.791
that says you're the one… who's done it.

1:28:21.208 --> 1:28:23.958
And I-- I don't care what you've done,

1:28:24.666 --> 1:28:27.958
whether you done him
or killed him or what have you.

1:28:28.458 --> 1:28:31.500
I mean, there's…
there's nothing you can tell me

1:28:31.583 --> 1:28:32.708
that's gonna upset me.

1:28:34.166 --> 1:28:36.416
What I care about is being lied to.

1:28:37.333 --> 1:28:38.208
I'm not lying.

1:28:38.291 --> 1:28:40.791
You've had every opportunity
to be upfront with us.

1:28:41.666 --> 1:28:42.916
And if you're gonna…

1:28:44.625 --> 1:28:47.708
be dishonest in front of me
and say you had nothin' to do with it,

1:28:47.833 --> 1:28:49.708
-that's not what I've heard.
-Yeah.

1:28:50.583 --> 1:28:55.541
And I'd have no choice but to cut you out
and you'd be back to nothing.

1:28:58.916 --> 1:28:59.916
Yep.

1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:01.333
Yeah.

1:29:03.916 --> 1:29:06.916
And if they put you away for this,
there's nothin' I can do.

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.750
And there's a…
There's a stigma, there's a…

1:29:10.583 --> 1:29:13.166
there's a… a stigma about
this kind of thing inside.

1:29:15.333 --> 1:29:18.500
So, you know, I can create alibis,

1:29:18.583 --> 1:29:21.375
clear the site,
remove evidence, relocate you.

1:29:21.458 --> 1:29:22.750
I mean, you've seen that.

1:29:26.708 --> 1:29:27.541
All right.

1:29:30.958 --> 1:29:34.083
Sorry. Henry, what was that?

1:29:44.916 --> 1:29:46.791
<i>I killed him. I killed the boy.</i>

1:29:46.875 --> 1:29:49.291
-Jesus Christ. Fuck yes!

1:29:49.375 --> 1:29:51.041
-<i>Well, you know,</i>

1:29:51.750 --> 1:29:53.791
<i>you're gonna have to take me through it</i>

1:29:53.875 --> 1:29:57.291
<i>'cause we need to know</i>
<i>what we have to take care of.</i>

1:30:04.375 --> 1:30:05.208
<i>Uh…</i>

1:30:06.916 --> 1:30:07.916
<i>Uh…</i>

1:30:08.583 --> 1:30:10.333
<i>I saw him waiting at the underpass,</i>

1:30:10.416 --> 1:30:13.541
<i>so I pulled the car over,</i>
<i>and started to chat to him for a while</i>

1:30:13.625 --> 1:30:15.500
<i>and I talked him into the car.</i>

1:30:16.708 --> 1:30:19.333
<i>Cops have taken the car, searched it,</i>

1:30:19.416 --> 1:30:20.583
<i>came back with nothin'.</i>

1:30:21.208 --> 1:30:23.166
<i>They haven't found the body, obviously.</i>

1:30:23.916 --> 1:30:26.458
<i>And where did this happen?</i>

1:30:27.083 --> 1:30:27.958
<i>Just, um…</i>

1:30:38.916 --> 1:30:39.875
What happened?

1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:43.958
John said we've got to go and fuckin'

1:30:44.458 --> 1:30:46.208
wait there in my fuckin' car.

1:30:47.250 --> 1:30:48.666
What? What is it?

1:30:49.166 --> 1:30:51.666
Nothin'. I don't know. Fuck. Uh…

1:30:52.500 --> 1:30:55.125
Just put the work on hold
for a while or something, um,

1:30:55.208 --> 1:30:56.833
while he sorts a few things out.

1:30:56.916 --> 1:30:59.458
-You told him about the airfield?
-Yeah.

1:31:00.375 --> 1:31:03.125
Look, I don't know how much
I can tell you, man, all right?

1:31:08.666 --> 1:31:10.916
<i>He was dead before anyone</i>
<i>knew he was missing.</i>

1:31:12.333 --> 1:31:13.833
Before the police were called.

1:31:14.750 --> 1:31:17.333
Before his family even
started looking, he was dead.

1:31:18.541 --> 1:31:22.166
Detectives will regroup in Queensland
to determine if arrest will be made.

1:31:23.500 --> 1:31:27.458
<i>The undercover operation will continue</i>
<i>with Detective Sergeant Cross</i>

1:31:27.541 --> 1:31:30.166
<i>to return the suspect</i>
<i>to the scene of the offence.</i>

1:31:31.333 --> 1:31:35.583
<i>The site itself will need to be contained</i>
<i>in preparation for a search for evidence.</i>

1:31:37.250 --> 1:31:40.000
<i>Henry,</i>
<i>I'm what's referred to as a cleaner.</i>

1:31:40.583 --> 1:31:43.958
<i>The organization's brought me in</i>
<i>to ensure the police can find nothing</i>

1:31:44.041 --> 1:31:46.666
that could be brought against
you at this new inquest.

1:31:47.166 --> 1:31:50.375
So talk me through it all
and I'll decide the right course for us.

1:31:50.458 --> 1:31:53.125
I read all the press
and reports and that.

1:31:53.916 --> 1:31:56.416
It wasn't a black car,
it wasn't two… two men.

1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:57.875
I was on me own.

1:31:57.958 --> 1:32:01.166
I didn't park at the overpass,
I parked behind it at my old church.

1:32:01.250 --> 1:32:02.958
It happened in an old demountable.

1:32:03.500 --> 1:32:04.333
Uh…

1:32:04.875 --> 1:32:07.333
So here, it's, uh,
about an hour and a half

1:32:07.416 --> 1:32:09.458
north of the city, out in the mountains.

1:32:09.541 --> 1:32:12.291
-It was an old forestry site.
-Where is the demountable?

1:32:14.125 --> 1:32:17.333
Uh, they took it away when…
when they closed the site.

1:32:20.166 --> 1:32:21.541
There's nothin' in it, so--

1:32:21.625 --> 1:32:23.375
Couldn't there be traces in there?

1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:27.166
No.

1:32:27.250 --> 1:32:28.250
All right.

1:32:31.041 --> 1:32:32.875
Well, what happened after he, um…

1:32:35.166 --> 1:32:36.375
after he died?

1:32:37.250 --> 1:32:40.791
I took him out a bit further, you know,
covered him up with grass, branches,

1:32:40.875 --> 1:32:41.833
that sort of thing.

1:32:41.916 --> 1:32:45.375
Left him there, went back about a week
or two later and he was almost gone.

1:32:45.458 --> 1:32:46.458
What do you mean?

1:32:48.750 --> 1:32:50.291
There were just little pieces of him.

1:32:50.791 --> 1:32:52.666
No. No, we have to find everything.

1:32:52.750 --> 1:32:53.916
What about his clothes?

1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:55.458
I threw them in the creek.

1:32:55.541 --> 1:32:58.000
-How long ago was this?
-About eight years now.

1:32:58.083 --> 1:32:59.833
Why did you take his clothes off?

1:33:01.250 --> 1:33:02.541
I don't know, Mark.

1:33:04.041 --> 1:33:05.875
I suppose you had to get rid of 'em.

1:33:12.666 --> 1:33:14.041
What have you done then?

1:33:14.125 --> 1:33:15.375
I went home.

1:33:17.125 --> 1:33:18.125
How'd you do it?

1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:20.958
-How do you mean?
-How'd you kill him?

1:33:22.458 --> 1:33:25.041
-I put my arm around his neck.
-Right. Show us on Mark.

1:33:25.125 --> 1:33:29.166
Mark, can you just pop yourself down
and we'll take a look at that.

1:33:36.166 --> 1:33:37.875
All right.

1:33:55.875 --> 1:33:58.583
All right. Yeah. It doesn't matter.

1:33:59.458 --> 1:34:01.708
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1:34:02.541 --> 1:34:03.791
Yeah.

1:34:11.416 --> 1:34:13.500
-You need to take us there.
-Yeah.

1:34:13.583 --> 1:34:15.666
-Need to clear everything.
-Can Mark come?

1:34:15.750 --> 1:34:16.916
-Yeah.
-Ah.

1:34:17.666 --> 1:34:20.666
It doesn't matter where we sit
as long as we're fuckin' together.

1:34:21.500 --> 1:34:23.875
Like, you know, the same fuckin' row.

1:34:24.958 --> 1:34:27.208
So the flight is sorted.

1:34:28.083 --> 1:34:31.458
Uh, well, he'll call me in five
but I'm gonna go sort the car out.

1:34:33.416 --> 1:34:34.291
Hey.

1:34:35.541 --> 1:34:36.583
Henry.

1:34:37.291 --> 1:34:38.833
Um, I'm gonna…

1:34:39.916 --> 1:34:42.041
Mate, I'm… I'm… Come here.

1:34:42.916 --> 1:34:45.791
Come here, mate. Fuck.
I'm just…

1:34:48.333 --> 1:34:50.166
I'm so proud of you, brother.

1:34:52.208 --> 1:34:53.375
Yeah.

1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:15.416
<i>This briefing</i>
<i>has been called to determine</i>

1:35:15.500 --> 1:35:18.041
<i>whether an arrest</i>
<i>should be made of Peter Morley,</i>

1:35:18.125 --> 1:35:20.208
<i>otherwise known as Henry Peter Teague,</i>

1:35:20.291 --> 1:35:22.916
in the abduction and murder
of James Liston,

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.833
eight years ago on the 12th of May, 2002.

1:35:28.333 --> 1:35:29.541
<i>As you're all aware,</i>

1:35:29.625 --> 1:35:33.000
<i>this is the largest missing-persons case</i>
<i>in the history of our state</i>

1:35:33.708 --> 1:35:36.083
<i>and is one of the largest</i>
<i>in the history of our country.</i>

1:35:36.166 --> 1:35:38.125
-I'm going to the bathroom.

1:35:38.666 --> 1:35:41.166
<i>The investigation has</i>
<i>spanned over eight years</i>

1:35:41.250 --> 1:35:43.416
<i>and is one of the largest joint operations</i>

1:35:43.500 --> 1:35:46.333
<i>ever undertaken by interstate agencies.</i>

1:35:46.416 --> 1:35:50.250
Peter Morley was born to a normal,
middle-class military family.

1:35:51.166 --> 1:35:56.125
There is no evidence to suggest as a child
Peter Morley was the subject of abuse.

1:36:02.583 --> 1:36:05.666
<i>This investigation</i>
<i>has completely disproved Morley's alibi…</i>

1:36:06.416 --> 1:36:08.000
He's just gone to the bathroom.

1:36:08.625 --> 1:36:10.458
<i>…and has</i>
<i>unearthed the full details</i>

1:36:10.541 --> 1:36:14.083
<i>of his previous assault of a child</i>
<i>in the Northern Territory</i>

1:36:14.166 --> 1:36:16.291
<i>for which he served two years in jail.</i>

1:36:17.791 --> 1:36:18.791
Lights, please.

1:36:23.708 --> 1:36:28.958
This child was taken from
a family crisis center in the NT in 1996.

1:36:30.166 --> 1:36:31.833
He was not known to the offender.

1:36:33.708 --> 1:36:35.791
Attending doctors observed that the child

1:36:35.875 --> 1:36:41.041
had lacerations and abrasions
to his legs, arms and torso.

1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:46.250
His hair, face and body
were covered in dirt,

1:36:47.125 --> 1:36:49.375
with blood present in the nose and mouth.

1:36:50.583 --> 1:36:52.166
He had blackened eyes,

1:36:53.416 --> 1:36:54.916
several closed fractures,

1:36:55.750 --> 1:36:57.041
a collapsed lung,

1:36:58.291 --> 1:37:00.416
severe bruises beneath his hairline,

1:37:02.166 --> 1:37:04.583
and deep cuts to his scalp and genitalia.

1:37:06.625 --> 1:37:10.541
The overall pattern indicated
widespread and repeated applications

1:37:11.041 --> 1:37:14.541
of both blunt and sharp-force trauma.

1:37:16.375 --> 1:37:18.375
Contusions to the throat

1:37:18.458 --> 1:37:21.250
in association with
hemorrhaging in the eyes

1:37:21.333 --> 1:37:22.958
was indicative of suffocation.

1:37:24.083 --> 1:37:27.916
He was found barely alive
in the remnants of a burnt-out car

1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.333
less than 100 meters
from where he was taken.

1:37:32.458 --> 1:37:34.583
On returning to the site of the abduction,

1:37:34.666 --> 1:37:38.583
Peter Morley offered to lead the search
for the person responsible.

1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:41.125
-Hello?

1:37:43.375 --> 1:37:44.958
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1:37:45.666 --> 1:37:46.916
-Sorry.
-Nah.

1:37:53.458 --> 1:37:54.666
Thought you'd fallen in.

1:37:57.916 --> 1:38:00.625
I can't fuckin' breathe, man.
I can't fuckin' breathe.

1:38:01.583 --> 1:38:02.583
-Yeah, you can.
-Nah.

1:38:02.666 --> 1:38:03.541
Yeah, you can.

1:38:04.083 --> 1:38:06.291
Ready?

1:38:10.958 --> 1:38:12.833
I want to
raise a few issues here.

1:38:12.916 --> 1:38:14.875
Regardless of his assault
on this other child,

1:38:14.958 --> 1:38:16.833
in this case, the timelines are thin,

1:38:17.708 --> 1:38:19.375
even with the break in his alibi.

1:38:19.458 --> 1:38:23.333
We're talking about an hour
to abduct a person--

1:38:23.416 --> 1:38:25.583
I have to be clear,
this is a practiced offender

1:38:25.666 --> 1:38:28.541
-who's placed himself at the scene--
-You've been clear.

1:38:28.625 --> 1:38:31.708
-You've had your time. Now sit down.
-I want to clarify something.

1:38:31.791 --> 1:38:33.541
Let's have some contention in the process.

1:38:33.625 --> 1:38:36.958
I want to clarify something.
The duration of the assault in the NT?

1:38:39.125 --> 1:38:40.333
Fifteen minutes.

1:38:45.833 --> 1:38:48.916
There's never been anyone
locked up in Queensland without a body.

1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.083
New South Wales there has. Not here.

1:38:51.166 --> 1:38:56.000
I, um… I mentioned the yard
where you talked about shredding the cars.

1:38:56.416 --> 1:38:58.625
Is that somewhere that we should head to?

1:38:58.708 --> 1:39:01.291
-Nah, mate.
-I just thought maybe--

1:39:01.375 --> 1:39:02.458
No, Mark, no.

1:39:05.333 --> 1:39:07.000
What were you wearing on the day?

1:39:07.083 --> 1:39:10.083
I threw it all on the fire,
burnt it all, shoes as well.

1:39:11.041 --> 1:39:13.750
-There's nothing left?
-Nothing left. Nothing.

1:39:13.833 --> 1:39:16.750
-Where are the ashes?
-I threw them out on the lawn

1:39:16.833 --> 1:39:19.458
and then I got the dirt
ripped up and taken away, so…

1:39:19.541 --> 1:39:21.000
Fuckin' well done.

1:39:21.083 --> 1:39:23.083
That's gold. Fuckin' gold.

1:39:23.375 --> 1:39:26.708
I didn't mean to do it, though.
I didn't know it would happen.

1:39:26.791 --> 1:39:29.291
It's like how the words
are coming out of me mouth now,

1:39:29.375 --> 1:39:31.750
like how I'm saying it to you now,
like it's nothing.

1:39:34.625 --> 1:39:37.000
-How far from here?
-Not far.

1:39:37.916 --> 1:39:39.541
That's my old church there.

1:39:39.625 --> 1:39:41.000
That's where I was married.

1:39:41.083 --> 1:39:44.083
Don't know what I was fuckin'
thinkin' of at the time.

1:39:45.166 --> 1:39:46.208
Yeah.

1:39:46.291 --> 1:39:48.625
-This is where I picked him up, here.

1:39:49.791 --> 1:39:52.750
No, don't fuckin' pull over.
There's a camera there.

1:39:52.833 --> 1:39:54.458
There's a camera there, mate.

1:39:54.541 --> 1:39:55.625
Just keep going.

1:39:59.375 --> 1:40:01.708
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>about whether he did it.</i>

1:40:01.791 --> 1:40:04.500
<i>It's about whether</i>
<i>or not it's prosecutable.</i>

1:40:05.125 --> 1:40:08.250
And you can talk about
an unsolicited confession all you like.

1:40:08.333 --> 1:40:12.041
This undercover operation
induces a suspect to confess.

1:40:12.916 --> 1:40:15.541
It's inducement without evidence.

1:40:17.041 --> 1:40:19.166
This is where I threw his clothes.

1:40:20.625 --> 1:40:22.041
There's nothing here.

1:40:24.458 --> 1:40:25.375
That's good.

1:40:27.791 --> 1:40:30.500
I strongly submit that we
continue the covert operation

1:40:30.583 --> 1:40:32.166
while the area's being searched

1:40:32.250 --> 1:40:34.625
because if you go for
an arrest without evidence

1:40:34.708 --> 1:40:36.666
and you find nothing, he walks.

1:40:38.500 --> 1:40:41.125
I refuse to put the victim's family
through that for nothing.

1:40:41.208 --> 1:40:43.666
As you're aware,
the commissioner has tasked me

1:40:43.750 --> 1:40:46.875
with making a decision as to whether
or not an arrest is to take place.

1:40:46.958 --> 1:40:48.541
Without evidence, he walks.

1:40:49.750 --> 1:40:52.000
And that will be
my decision to make.

1:41:03.708 --> 1:41:05.250
Just pull in up there.

1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:14.000
Is this it?

1:41:18.041 --> 1:41:18.958
Yep.

1:41:28.791 --> 1:41:31.000
So this is where
the demountable was?

1:41:32.875 --> 1:41:35.000
-Yeah.
-So you killed him in there…

1:41:37.750 --> 1:41:39.333
and you dragged him down where?

1:42:21.750 --> 1:42:23.833
I don't remember that water being there.

1:42:27.291 --> 1:42:28.500
It was here though.

1:42:30.333 --> 1:42:31.333
Here.

1:42:34.875 --> 1:42:35.833
You sure?

1:42:45.583 --> 1:42:46.875
Yeah, there's nothing.

1:43:03.416 --> 1:43:04.583
It's all right.

1:43:07.208 --> 1:43:08.208
It's all right.

1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.708
<i>Hold it there!</i>
<i>Hold it there!</i>

1:43:13.791 --> 1:43:16.250
<i>Stay where you are, mate!</i>
<i>Just stay where you are!</i>

1:44:32.500 --> 1:44:34.208
Thank you all for your attendance.

1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:39.750
I'll let you know at the outset that
we won't be able to answer any questions.

1:44:39.833 --> 1:44:42.208
<i>I can confirm that earlier today,</i>
<i>an arrest was made</i>

1:44:42.291 --> 1:44:46.041
<i>in relation to the disappearance</i>
<i>of James Liston on May 12, 2002.</i>

1:44:46.125 --> 1:44:50.208
<i>Police are currently securing a large area</i>
<i>in anticipation of an extensive search.</i>

1:44:57.791 --> 1:45:01.500
<i>The search area itself</i>
<i>is located in the Queensland floodplain.</i>

1:45:01.583 --> 1:45:05.416
<i>The issue that we are facing</i>
<i>is that flooding over the past eight years</i>

1:45:05.500 --> 1:45:07.625
<i>may have removed any remaining evidence.</i>

1:45:16.541 --> 1:45:17.833
Henry Teague.

1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:20.458
As informed earlier,

1:45:20.541 --> 1:45:23.500
you're here under arrest with regard
to the abduction of James Liston

1:45:23.583 --> 1:45:24.750
on the 12th May, 2002.

1:45:24.833 --> 1:45:27.875
I haven't done this, you know.
Nothin' to do with me, mate.

1:45:28.500 --> 1:45:30.708
As long as you didn't do it,
there'll be no evidence

1:45:30.791 --> 1:45:32.958
and you've got nothing to worry about.

1:45:33.041 --> 1:45:35.500
Now, you got a minute.
Anything you need?

1:45:36.583 --> 1:45:37.791
Anyone got a smoke?

1:46:23.333 --> 1:46:26.666
<i>We'll be undertaking</i>
<i>a basic search of the forest covering.</i>

1:46:26.750 --> 1:46:29.416
<i>We have around four acres to manage.</i>

1:46:38.541 --> 1:46:41.083
<i>Additional Forensics are</i>
<i>searching the demountable</i>

1:46:41.166 --> 1:46:43.333
<i>which was relocated when the site sold</i>

1:46:43.416 --> 1:46:45.916
<i>and where it's alleged</i>
<i>that the victim was killed.</i>

1:46:52.416 --> 1:46:54.416
<i>Don't disturb potential evidence.</i>

1:46:55.208 --> 1:46:59.625
If you come across anything,
pause and raise your hand.

1:48:12.416 --> 1:48:14.958
-How we looking?
-Found nothing.

1:48:15.041 --> 1:48:16.125
-Nothing at all?
-No.

1:48:16.208 --> 1:48:18.708
The divers have finished with
the lake, but no, nothing.

1:48:18.791 --> 1:48:19.791
Right.

1:51:12.666 --> 1:51:13.666
No, hold on.

1:51:34.875 --> 1:51:36.083
<i>It's night.</i>

1:51:38.083 --> 1:51:39.416
<i>I'm in my house.</i>

1:51:41.500 --> 1:51:43.500
<i>My son is asleep in his room.</i>

1:51:46.125 --> 1:51:47.541
<i>And I hear a voice.</i>

1:51:49.500 --> 1:51:51.416
<i>It's coming from downstairs.</i>

1:51:53.958 --> 1:51:55.250
<i>I walk toward it.</i>

1:51:58.333 --> 1:51:59.750
<i>I can barely breathe.</i>

1:52:02.750 --> 1:52:04.375
<i>It's not a person talking.</i>

1:52:06.583 --> 1:52:08.375
<i>It's a tape recorder.</i>

1:52:11.166 --> 1:52:13.208
<i>I press the button to turn it off.</i>

1:52:15.083 --> 1:52:16.541
<i>But when I turn it off…</i>

1:52:18.750 --> 1:52:20.375
<i>the voice keeps coming…</i>

1:52:23.041 --> 1:52:24.208
<i>…keeps talking.</i>
