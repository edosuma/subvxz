WEBVTT

00:34.360 --> 00:36.280
[birds chirping]

00:39.280 --> 00:42.120
Oh, look! It's the Monkey King!

00:45.640 --> 00:46.640
[sniffs]

00:48.920 --> 00:49.920
[gasps]

01:11.320 --> 01:13.280
[Tripitaka] Monkey had
scattered the seven scrolls

01:13.360 --> 01:15.560
to every known corner of the world,

01:15.640 --> 01:17.760
and our mission was to get them back.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.760
We were traveling to
the Mountain of Fruit and Flowers,

01:21.840 --> 01:24.480
where the first of the sacred scrolls
was hidden.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.840
I am Tripitaka.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.440
At least,
that's who my friends think I am.

01:34.080 --> 01:38.560
When you pretend to be someone else,
you can never really let your guard down.

01:39.520 --> 01:40.520
[Pigsy groans]

01:40.600 --> 01:43.440
How much further is this
Mountain of Fruit and Flowers?

01:43.520 --> 01:46.080
It was much closer
when I was traveling by cloud.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.720
However far, it'll be worth it
to find one of the sacred scrolls.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.480
-[sighs]
-If we make it.

01:50.560 --> 01:51.760
Has anyone got any water?

01:52.800 --> 01:56.480
You are carrying half a village
on your back, and you didn't bring water?

01:56.560 --> 01:58.640
[sighs] We can drink from that cactus.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.400
[sighs]

02:01.160 --> 02:02.040
[Pigsy grunts]

02:11.680 --> 02:14.520
[grunts] Ugh, is it meant
to smell like that?

02:14.600 --> 02:17.240
They call it the rotten corpse cactus,
but it's not poisonous.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.600
[clears throat]

02:28.240 --> 02:29.240
[gagging]

02:30.480 --> 02:31.640
[retches]

02:32.240 --> 02:33.720
[coughing]

02:35.920 --> 02:36.920
[sighs]

02:37.720 --> 02:39.240
It's better than dying of thirst.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.160
Is it? Is it really?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.800
Sandy, you must be thirsty.

02:45.880 --> 02:49.680
I am severely dehydrated,
but I'll wait till we get to the lake.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.080
What lake?

02:51.160 --> 02:52.840
The lake behind that ridge.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.080
Why didn't you say anything?

03:08.520 --> 03:09.600
Just did.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.080
[Monkey] Whoo-hoo!

03:12.160 --> 03:15.240
Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Ah!

03:18.160 --> 03:19.440
[Sandy] You're not coming in?

03:20.160 --> 03:21.360
We've been traveling for days.

03:21.440 --> 03:24.400
It's not that. I... can't.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.440
I'm not permitted to bathe with others.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.440
It's a monk thing.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.880
No one's here to see you.
We won't tell anyone.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.360
It's not about who sees him.
It's about doing the right thing.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.360
[Pigsy] Hmm.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.040
I'll have a bath when you're finished.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.040
[gasps]

03:47.800 --> 03:50.280
[bandits exclaiming wildly]

04:00.240 --> 04:01.880
Good day, travelers.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.280
I am the Monkey King.

04:04.840 --> 04:09.040
We'll take your weapons. We'll also keep
the shoes. You may then go on your way.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.520
And, uh, if we don't agree?

04:12.720 --> 04:13.880
We destroy you.

04:15.760 --> 04:16.760
[groans]

04:18.760 --> 04:20.680
Sorry, I didn't quite catch your name.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.240
I am Affe. I have been chosen
by the great Monkey King's spirit.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.960
I am the keeper of his legacy.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.240
His power lives within me.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.400
-Do you know who you're talking--
-Be quiet, little wise man.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.800
[both grunting]

04:33.480 --> 04:36.280
And what legacy do you keep?
Dirty fighting?

04:36.360 --> 04:39.040
We protect the Monkey King's
sacred relic from demons.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.160
Demons like you.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.240
[grunts]

04:42.000 --> 04:43.400
Tell me about your Monkey King.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.720
He was courageous and skilled in combat.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.160
[grunts]

04:47.240 --> 04:48.240
And?

04:48.320 --> 04:51.000
He was a symbol of hope in the battle
against the great demon scourge.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.160
[groans]

04:52.240 --> 04:54.040
-And?
-And...

04:54.600 --> 04:55.800
[groans]

04:57.440 --> 04:58.640
He's also very handsome.

04:58.720 --> 04:59.680
[all gasp]

04:59.760 --> 05:01.160
It's him!

05:01.240 --> 05:04.120
I'm unsure what's happening right now.
[gasps]

05:04.200 --> 05:08.560
I am the Monkey King.
And I am pleased to meet you.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.160
Well...

05:11.240 --> 05:14.240
Well, the Monkey Clan's greatest dream
has come true.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.160
We are your humble servants.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.920
All hail the Monkey King!

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
[bandits chanting]
All hail the Monkey King!

05:20.080 --> 05:23.920
All hail the Monkey King!
All hail the Monkey King!

05:24.000 --> 05:25.880
All hail the Monkey King!

05:25.960 --> 05:29.960
-All hail the Monkey King!
-Uh, can I have my boots back, please?

05:30.040 --> 05:32.280
-[drumming and singing]
-[indistinct chatter]

05:32.360 --> 05:33.680
[bandit] It's amazing.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.440
It's amazing! It's amazing!

05:40.120 --> 05:41.120
My family...

05:42.680 --> 05:44.160
He has come.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.320
Five hundred years ago,
our forefathers made a promise

05:48.400 --> 05:52.040
to protect the sacred scroll
Monkey entrusted to us with our lives.

05:52.120 --> 05:56.440
And ever since, we have waited for the day
in the hope that he would one day return.

05:56.520 --> 05:59.520
And now, that day has finally come!

05:59.600 --> 06:00.680
[bandits cheering]

06:00.760 --> 06:03.400
Whatever you want,
benevolent leader, it's yours.

06:03.480 --> 06:06.720
I would rip my heart from my chest
and give it to you if you asked.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.200
-Does he seem a little--
-Odd?

06:08.280 --> 06:09.560
He's crazy.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.880
-To the Monkey King!
-[bandits] The Monkey King!

06:12.520 --> 06:16.840
At last, we can see for ourselves,
brothers and sisters,

06:16.920 --> 06:21.560
the King who can harness thunder
and fly upon a cloud.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.560
[gasps]

06:22.640 --> 06:25.480
Owner of the magical Wishing Staff,
who can shrink himself

06:25.560 --> 06:28.960
to the size of a bee
and sting the whole world.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.720
Sting the world?

06:30.800 --> 06:32.640
Our Monkey King!

06:32.720 --> 06:34.440
[bandits cheering]

06:37.320 --> 06:39.000
Thank you. Uh...

06:40.200 --> 06:41.200
It's good to be back.

06:41.280 --> 06:45.240
Monkey, splinter yourself into 100
exact and perfect replicas of yourself.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.880
-[bandits] Yeah!
-Call up your cloud!

06:47.960 --> 06:51.120
Let us see you fly through the sky
on your cloud! Yeah!

06:51.200 --> 06:52.360
[bandits] Yeah!

06:52.440 --> 06:55.960
I'm afraid that, uh,
due to my many centuries of imprisonment,

06:56.600 --> 07:00.680
some of those powers
are momentarily diminished.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.360
[bandits] Oh.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.640
Some. Some.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.760
Not all.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.520
[bandits gasping]

07:14.600 --> 07:16.440
[cheering]

07:16.520 --> 07:17.800
[chuckles]

07:20.200 --> 07:23.560
So, who wants to smash some demon skulls?

07:23.640 --> 07:25.200
[bandits cheering]

07:25.760 --> 07:28.440
Who wants to join me
and create a Monkey army?

07:28.520 --> 07:29.720
[bandits cheering]

07:29.800 --> 07:34.200
Let's carve our own path
through this so-called demonic reign.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.360
Let's do it!

07:35.440 --> 07:36.480
-Who will stand up?
-[bandits] Yeah!

07:36.560 --> 07:37.520
I'm standing!

07:37.600 --> 07:39.960
It's time to take the fight to our enemy!

07:40.040 --> 07:41.560
[bandits cheering]

07:43.320 --> 07:44.680
[bandits hooting]

07:44.760 --> 07:48.720
[bandit chanting] Monkey King!
Monkey King! Monkey King!

07:48.800 --> 07:50.760
[tribal music playing]

07:58.680 --> 08:01.280
[woman] Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

08:01.360 --> 08:02.360
Ah...

08:03.080 --> 08:04.880
I'm used to eating like this, you know?

08:05.760 --> 08:09.920
A banquet for every meal,
pillows of the softest feathers.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.840
But it all came at a cost.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.920
Ah... I know that look.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.440
Oh, no, we're just friends.
We work together.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.880
You need some advice?

08:28.960 --> 08:30.560
Yes. Anything.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.280
-Can you dance?
-No.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.640
So don't dance.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.520
That's your advice?

08:36.600 --> 08:40.240
The message is work to your strengths.
You'll get there.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.000
So I got all of these
at the, uh, Jade Palace.

08:50.120 --> 08:54.000
And this, I had to fight 12 demons.
It wasn't easy.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.680
And this, I don't remember
where I got that from.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.080
Can we talk?

09:03.880 --> 09:04.880
Disperse.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.920
These people might not like it when
they realize that you're lying to them.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
An army?

09:14.080 --> 09:15.480
Who says I'm lying?

09:15.560 --> 09:17.200
These are good people.
They fight the good fight.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.720
We came here to retrieve the first
of the ancient scrolls. That's all.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.360
And who's to say that training
an army of bandits isn't a better plan?

09:23.440 --> 09:24.760
I do, because it isn't.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.040
Who appointed you ruler and judge?

09:26.120 --> 09:28.880
You would abandon everything
the scholar has worked for,

09:28.960 --> 09:30.360
the entire resistance,

09:30.440 --> 09:33.520
just so you could be adored
by a bunch of derelicts and sycophants.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.320
Are you really that shallow?

09:36.040 --> 09:37.320
You know what I think?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.680
I think you and the scholar spent
too much time with your head in books

09:39.760 --> 09:41.720
and not enough time in the real world.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.080
Maybe he wasn't as smart
as he led you to believe.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.800
Did you ever stop to think about that?

09:45.880 --> 09:48.960
And besides, he's dead,
so who cares what he thought?

09:49.680 --> 09:50.800
[chanting] Na ninekah alookah...

09:51.760 --> 09:53.920
[Monkey groaning]

09:57.720 --> 09:59.480
[breathing heavily]

09:59.560 --> 10:03.920
I'm glad he's not here.
He would be so disappointed in you.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.640
[Affe] For 500 years
we have kept the scroll safe

10:16.720 --> 10:19.640
by cultivating and maintaining
a series of traps

10:19.720 --> 10:21.560
so that no one could ever find it on foot.

10:22.440 --> 10:27.440
However, as the esteemed cloud is
not available to you at the present time,

10:27.520 --> 10:29.480
that is the only way
for us to retrieve it.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.520
Which is why I present to you
two of our finest warriors,

10:33.600 --> 10:35.840
well versed in the traps
and how to disarm them.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.720
I present to you Jiro and Bobbo.

10:41.160 --> 10:45.520
I'm Jiro. Uh, my great-great-great-great-
great-great-great grandparents

10:45.600 --> 10:48.800
helped design and build the cleverness
that protects the scrolls.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.600
And I am Bobbo. I am the smartest member
of the Monkey Clan ever to be born.

10:53.680 --> 10:57.280
I have studied the ancient maps
and have devised some more modern ways

10:57.360 --> 11:01.160
to disarm and outwit the perils
we will encounter within.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.040
Okay, lead the way.

11:09.680 --> 11:10.880
Monkey.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.480
I will get the scroll for you, monk.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.600
But that doesn't mean I have forgiven you.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.640
[screeching]

11:26.760 --> 11:28.160
Left. No, right.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.280
[wasps buzzing]

11:30.360 --> 11:31.360
Wait.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.080
Do you hear that?

11:35.160 --> 11:37.160
[buzzing continues]

11:45.240 --> 11:48.080
And so we find the ancient fire wasps.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.440
Oh, magnificent.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.680
[Bobbo] Too many stings,
and you'll scratch yourself until...

11:54.600 --> 11:57.120
Well, until there's nothing
left to scratch.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.880
[Affe] Disarm the trap.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.200
You got this, Bobbo.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.920
Remember the training.
We've been waiting for this moment.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.720
You did it! All hail the Monkey King!

12:45.800 --> 12:47.840
All hail the Monkey Ki-- [grunts]

12:54.760 --> 12:57.360
-Bobbo!
-No! [screams]

13:04.640 --> 13:05.840
[grunts]

13:05.920 --> 13:08.000
Oh, stay in one place so I can hit you!

13:09.320 --> 13:10.880
[grunts and groans]

13:10.960 --> 13:12.480
Quickly wise man, quickly!

13:15.160 --> 13:16.320
Hurry. This way.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.720
Wait. What about the others?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.160
We'll meet them
at the Temple of the Scroll.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.280
Look, don't worry,
I know my way around this forest.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.720
[Monkey] Tripitaka!

13:29.240 --> 13:30.240
Tripitaka!

13:32.280 --> 13:34.240
Ow. Where is that monk now?

13:34.320 --> 13:36.880
Don't worry, Affe will protect him.

13:39.960 --> 13:43.400
What is up with you two, anyway?
You've been at it all morning.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.480
It wouldn't have something to do

13:45.560 --> 13:47.880
with that speech you made
at the banquet, would it?

13:48.880 --> 13:50.720
What are you talking about?
What is wrong with my speech?

13:50.800 --> 13:51.880
[Sandy] I had a few notes.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.520
For one thing, you did kind of promise

13:59.600 --> 14:03.680
to take an entire clan of delinquent
tree pirates on a secret mission.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.520
We are all on our own journey.

14:07.320 --> 14:12.040
Before we met your little fan club here,
we were all actually on the same journey.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.480
Even if I was in a position
to be lectured to,

14:14.560 --> 14:15.840
which I'm not,

14:15.920 --> 14:18.200
you're the least qualified person
to do so.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.880
Just calling it like I see it.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.840
We've got more important things
to worry about. Let's go.

14:27.960 --> 14:28.960
Let's go.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.080
[screeching]

14:48.480 --> 14:49.560
Please.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.440
Thank you. You're so kind.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.320
I mix it with forest herbs.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.920
It's, uh... It's an old family recipe.
Maximum hydration.

15:03.480 --> 15:06.280
No, please. Drink more.

15:16.840 --> 15:17.920
There she is.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.800
The sacred scroll is in that shrine.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.400
[Monkey] That's it?

15:28.600 --> 15:29.640
What are we waiting for?

15:33.640 --> 15:36.680
Don't... don't worry, Monkey King.
We got this.

15:36.760 --> 15:41.040
The traps are timed to a sequence which
Jiro and I have both studied since birth.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.720
[both] "Take a step.
Not right, but left.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.760
Then two to the front.
Then back let's check.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.360
Five steps to the middle.
Then wait one breath.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.680
The stone will crash.
And then we dash.

15:50.760 --> 15:51.920
-[Jiro] Seven paces to the..."
-Nine paces to the..."

15:54.440 --> 15:56.400
Did you just say "nine"?

15:56.480 --> 15:58.160
Yeah. What did you say?

15:58.240 --> 16:00.240
-Seven.
-Huh.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.920
And you wanted to form an army
with these people.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.320
I liked being a leader.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.240
Everyone doing what you say.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.040
Sometimes it gets annoying.
Everyone looking at you for answers.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.960
"Affe! Affe! Show us the way!"

16:14.600 --> 16:16.320
But I liked it. I liked it very much.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.680
In fact, I'd do anything to hold onto it.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.560
[sighs] I hope we find the others soon.
I don't like being alone with you.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.800
Excellent. How are you feeling?

16:28.560 --> 16:30.240
I'm frightened.
I don't know where to go next,

16:30.320 --> 16:32.960
and I'm afraid everyone will find out
all the things I don't know.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.320
My special recipe.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.360
It's good for thirst.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.080
It's also good for getting people
to tell you the truth.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.320
You can't lie now, monk. Neither can I.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.080
Fun times.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.680
I really don't like you.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.880
I wish I didn't like you,

16:47.960 --> 16:51.320
but I feel strangely compelled
to be around you. What is that?

16:52.280 --> 16:53.520
Hey, hey, settle down.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.680
[chuckles] Settle down, monk.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.160
You had a lot of the truth water.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.640
It can make you feel a little dizzy
if you're not used to it.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.400
I don't wanna have to tie you up.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.880
Which must be the truth. [laughs]

17:12.760 --> 17:15.599
There doesn't seem to be
a discernible pattern.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.200
At least, not that I can see.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.800
How about we send a volunteer?

17:20.560 --> 17:21.920
Well, there are two of you.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.560
Enough of this. We are gods.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.800
If we combine our powers,
there must be a way to overcome this.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.080
Isn't that why we've been chosen?

17:35.640 --> 17:37.240
Tell me your secrets, Tripitaka.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.040
My name's not Tripitaka,
and I'm not a monk.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.040
Whoa. What are you?

17:44.680 --> 17:50.160
I'm just a girl pretending to be a monk,
pretending to be Tripitaka.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.400
[Affe laughs]

17:52.320 --> 17:53.320
A girl?

17:53.960 --> 17:55.400
That is so devious!

17:55.480 --> 17:57.280
You really are something else.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.520
I have every mind to make you my wife.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.760
-That's never gonna happen.
-I'll have to kill you soon anyway.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.200
Can't have two of us knowing
how to control the Monkey King.

18:06.640 --> 18:10.160
Better yet, I'll get Monkey to do it
in front of the others. Oh!

18:10.240 --> 18:14.240
[inhales deeply] Mmm, today is
going to be a good day.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.440
There is no way
that Monkey will ever hurt me.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.200
Really?

18:20.520 --> 18:25.480
I want you to tell me the chant.
I want you to tell it to me right now.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.800
Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

18:29.880 --> 18:33.400
[both] Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.160
This is the grand summation
of our combined powers?

18:42.240 --> 18:44.640
[Monkey] I don't remember seeing
you throwing out any suggestions.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.080
-It appears to have broken.
-[Pigsy] Broken?

18:51.160 --> 18:52.920
It is 500 years old.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.320
Where is it?

19:15.400 --> 19:18.920
This is not possible. My... my people have
guarded this for hundreds of years.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.680
[Sandy] Maybe it's supposed to be empty.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.800
Maybe it's all about the journey,
not the destination.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.720
Yeah... No,
someone's ripped the buckle off.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.520
[Affe] It's been gone for years.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.520
My family sold it generations ago

19:30.600 --> 19:32.800
to a demon who paid us
a lot of money for it.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.560
What have you done to Tripitaka?

19:35.680 --> 19:39.680
Not much. A touch of truth serum.
Had some myself, too.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.200
He's not just weird,
he's a liar and a very poor leader.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.920
Pigsy, you really need
to wash your clothes more often.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.880
[Affe] I thought you might have been
killed by the spikes.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.200
But since you made it to the shrine,

19:49.280 --> 19:51.160
I'm gonna have to take things
into my own hands.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.000
Challenge the Monkey King,
and you will be punished.

19:54.080 --> 19:57.120
You wish! I am the Monkey King!

19:57.200 --> 20:01.320
Witness! This is no god.
This is a puppet. A nothing.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.720
This should be good.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.480
[Tripitaka] Monkey, I'm sorry.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.040
I tried to stop myself
from telling him, but I couldn't.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.760
Yeah. Stand back, puppet Monkey.

20:09.840 --> 20:13.160
I want you to show your allegiance to me
as the true Monkey King

20:13.240 --> 20:14.760
by killing this monk.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.880
Um... no.

20:19.800 --> 20:24.280
Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.760
Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah!

20:37.000 --> 20:38.280
Why isn't it working?

20:39.280 --> 20:44.000
Truth is, the Crown Sutra will only work
if one is righteous and pure of heart.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.200
Righteous and pure of heart?

20:47.040 --> 20:50.120
This one here
is more devious than me by far.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.160
Your precious little monk
is nothing more than--

20:53.240 --> 20:55.280
[grunts and groans]

21:01.720 --> 21:03.000
Well, I guess he got the point.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.560
It's too soon, isn't it?

21:05.640 --> 21:06.640
Yep.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.280
Follow that road. It'll take you west.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.560
Thank you. Good luck.
You both will make great leaders.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.280
And I hope we can honor your legacy.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.320
You ever need an army, you got one.
You know where to find us.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.560
I hope one day we can fight
alongside each other. Thank you.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.120
[Pigsy] It was the real sutra?

21:38.680 --> 21:41.040
[Tripitaka] The poison drew it from me.
I couldn't lie.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.880
[Pigsy] Ah, righteous and pure. Shame.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.560
I was hoping to try it myself one day.

21:45.640 --> 21:46.920
[Sandy chuckles]

21:48.120 --> 21:49.120
[Monkey] Tripitaka.

21:49.880 --> 21:53.600
The, uh, truth serum,
is it out of your system yet?

21:54.360 --> 21:56.480
-Why, you want to ask me something?
-No.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Yes.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.080
No. No, no, you don't seem like the kind
of person that can tell a lie anyway.

22:04.640 --> 22:05.840
You want to know what I'm thinking?

22:06.760 --> 22:10.440
I'm thinking if one of the demons
found one of the scrolls,

22:10.520 --> 22:11.640
they could have found more.

22:11.720 --> 22:12.960
Crossed my mind.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.480
In which case, what do we do?

22:17.720 --> 22:19.400
What would the scholar tell us to do?

22:21.440 --> 22:26.840
The scholar would tell us to walk a path,
however narrow and crooked it gets.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.800
Well then, after you.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.560
[Raxion] Three gods are heading your way.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.200
[Davari] They thought
they'd find my scroll.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.920
Well, they can help me translate it.

22:52.800 --> 22:57.800
Raxion, find them and take them
to the shaman's breaking ground.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.520
Of course.

23:05.760 --> 23:10.160
[Davari sighs] Three more gods,
come to play.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.480
[theme music playing]
