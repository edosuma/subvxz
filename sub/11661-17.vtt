00:40.800 --> 00:45.633
(mellow music playing)

01:04.467 --> 01:06.734
-Hi, Ma. What you doing?
-Thinking.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.066
About what?

01:08.133 --> 01:11.367
About wind, water, rocks,

01:11.433 --> 01:14.967
man's place in the delicate balance
of nature's harmony,

01:15.033 --> 01:17.834
where we're going,
where the road ends.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.900
-I never knew you were so philosophical.
-I'm not.

01:20.967 --> 01:23.667
It's those damn infinity commercials.
They're driving me crazy.

01:26.467 --> 01:30.266
-Hello! Where is everybody?
-Oh, we're out here, Rose!

01:30.800 --> 01:31.800
Hi.

01:32.533 --> 01:33.967
What's all that?

01:34.033 --> 01:36.500
Weight loss products
I have to test for work.

01:36.567 --> 01:40.900
You wouldn't believe the length
people go to to drop a few pounds.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.533
One woman even had her jaw wired shut.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.066
Oh. Is that something
that you'll be testing, Rose?

01:50.066 --> 01:54.533
-Oh. Here you all are.
-How'd your physical go?

01:54.600 --> 01:58.066
Fine. The doctor couldn't believe it
when I told him my age.

01:58.133 --> 02:00.000
Why? What age did you tell him?

02:03.333 --> 02:05.767
Blanche, what is that thing?

02:05.834 --> 02:08.333
She's decided to install a change machine.

02:10.800 --> 02:15.867
Oh. It's called a halter monitor.
Makes a kind of ticker tape of the heart.

02:15.934 --> 02:17.767
-What's wrong with your heart?
-Nothing.

02:17.834 --> 02:20.734
Dr. Stein just thought
it sounded a little irregular.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.000
I think it was because
I was so uncomfortable

02:23.066 --> 02:25.567
sitting there topless with a strange man.

02:26.900 --> 02:30.533
Next time just pretend you're at home,
and he's the bug guy.

02:33.233 --> 02:37.100
-Blanche, what did the doctor say?
-He just muttered something in Latin.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.033
I explained to him
that Simon and I go out every night,

02:41.100 --> 02:44.133
-and it's just fatigue.
-What did he say?

02:44.200 --> 02:47.533
He wants to match the heartbeats
that this records to my activities.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.467
For 24 hours, I have to write down
everything I do.

02:51.533 --> 02:53.834
And you're not embarrassed
to have him read that smut?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.700
I'm proud of you, Blanche.

02:57.767 --> 03:00.934
If this were me,
I would be really scared.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.533
When I'm scared,
I put my head between my knees.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.600
That's for nausea.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.433
When I'm scared, I'm nauseous.

03:08.233 --> 03:11.166
You remember what happened
when that man tried to steal my purse?

03:11.233 --> 03:13.033
Worked better than mace.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.734
I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.433
Anyway, all the same, I'd better get busy
writing down my activities,

03:22.500 --> 03:25.867
and I'd better call Simon
and cancel our date for tonight.

03:25.934 --> 03:29.867
I'm really starting to care about him,
and I wouldn't want him worrying

03:29.934 --> 03:32.734
about my recording his performance.

03:34.834 --> 03:37.233
You know how fragile men's egos are.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.266
One little thing like
screaming out the wrong name,

03:40.333 --> 03:41.700
and they go all to pieces.

03:43.567 --> 03:48.867
(serene music playing)

04:00.133 --> 04:04.200
-Nice pants, Rose.
-They're called vacuum slacks.

04:06.467 --> 04:08.934
It's supposed to inhale all the fat
from your body.

04:09.567 --> 04:10.900
Watch.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.767
I must have done it wrong.
I'll put it on suck.

04:37.233 --> 04:40.300
-Oh, hello, ladies.
-What did the doctor say?

04:40.367 --> 04:43.367
-Oh, bad news.
-Oh, what?

04:43.433 --> 04:45.433
Oh, he told me he was married.

04:48.133 --> 04:49.867
Besides that, Blanche.

04:49.934 --> 04:54.533
He was a little concerned
because my pulse was slow and misbehaving.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.600
Rose, those pants.
Not with those shoes.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.300
Blanche, the doctor.

05:01.367 --> 05:04.066
You know how they get
over the slightest thing.

05:04.133 --> 05:05.133
And?

05:05.567 --> 05:11.066
And Dr. Worrywart wants me to check
into the hospital for more tests.

05:12.266 --> 05:16.000
Dorothy, have you been fooling around
with my tip O'Neill calendar?

05:16.066 --> 05:19.233
-No, Ma, I haven't.
-Come on. I'm missing March.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.433
It's the month where he's playing
volleyball with Jesse Helms.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.500
Ma, not now.

05:25.867 --> 05:29.700
Blanche's doctor wants her back
in the hospital for more tests.

05:29.767 --> 05:32.200
It makes sense, just to be safe.

05:32.266 --> 05:37.100
What kind of doctor would he be
if he didn't want to check out everything?

05:37.467 --> 05:40.633
Yeah, well, if it makes him happy.

05:40.700 --> 05:45.100
If everything's as bad as he thinks,
he'll put a pacemaker in me.

05:45.166 --> 05:47.567
Everybody's got a nickname for it.

05:57.367 --> 05:59.667
I've never been so scared
in all my life.

06:00.133 --> 06:03.400
-You know what I do when I'm scared?
-You toss your cookies.

06:04.667 --> 06:08.467
-I mean besides that. I sing.
-You what?

06:09.433 --> 06:12.734
A lullaby my mother sang to me
when I was little.

06:12.800 --> 06:16.867
When I'm scared, I sing it,
and it gives me courage.

06:16.934 --> 06:18.834
No song is going to help me.

06:22.533 --> 06:24.467
♪ <i>Over there</i> ♪

06:25.200 --> 06:26.867
♪ <i>Over there</i> ♪

06:26.934 --> 06:29.300
♪ <i>Send the word, send the word</i> ♪

06:29.367 --> 06:31.000
♪ <i>Over there</i> ♪

06:31.066 --> 06:33.900
♪ <i>That the yanks are coming</i>
<i>The yanks--</i> ♪

06:33.967 --> 06:37.233
That is the lullaby
that your mother sang to you?

06:37.700 --> 06:39.633
It's the only song she knew.

06:40.934 --> 06:44.433
During World War I, she gave doughnuts
and coffee to the doughboys

06:44.500 --> 06:46.400
before they left for Europe.

06:46.834 --> 06:48.567
It works. Truly.

06:48.633 --> 06:52.033
She said no one can be scared
when they hear that song...

06:52.500 --> 06:53.967
except maybe the Kaiser.

06:55.734 --> 06:57.333
I don't need a song.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.567
I want to be young and beautiful
and healthy again.

07:00.633 --> 07:04.767
-Blanche, that's what we all want.
-I know, but I deserve it.

07:07.233 --> 07:12.200
(mellow music playing)

07:14.567 --> 07:17.266
-How are we feeling, Mrs. Devereaux?
-A little nervous.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.700
-You really don't need makeup.
-I want to look good, just in case.

07:22.266 --> 07:25.266
-Just in case what?
-In case something should go wrong.

07:26.166 --> 07:28.967
I've been to enough funerals
to see how they make up dead people.

07:29.033 --> 07:30.567
They look like clowns.

07:31.900 --> 07:34.834
You expect to see a dozen of them
jump out of one coffin.

07:36.233 --> 07:39.700
I've done this 100 times.
You'll be fine in a week.

07:39.767 --> 07:40.767
Oh ho ho.

07:40.834 --> 07:43.433
We just cut one incision
below the collarbone,

07:43.500 --> 07:46.166
make a pocket for the pacemaker
under the muscle,

07:46.233 --> 07:49.000
then feed a tiny wire into the heart.

07:49.066 --> 07:52.000
The pacemaker gives little electric
shocks to the valve

07:52.066 --> 07:53.500
which regulates the heartbeat.

07:54.300 --> 07:57.100
-You mean you're going to cut into me?
-You did know that.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.767
-Won't that leave a scar?
-2 inches, tops.

07:59.834 --> 08:03.033
Oh, I'm sorry, but
I can't have any scars.

08:05.066 --> 08:09.900
See, my clothes are
all off-the-shoulder... sooner or later.

08:13.133 --> 08:16.667
-I have to give this some more thought.
-We don't have time for that.

08:16.734 --> 08:18.834
Everybody's already washed their hands.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.633
-Believe me, it'll be all right.
-Is anything wrong?

08:23.700 --> 08:27.333
She realized there'll be a scar.
It's really last-minute stage fright.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.333
-All my patients have it.
-I'm sure it'll be nothing.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.000
You'll hardly notice it.

08:32.066 --> 08:35.200
That madman wants to rip me open
from stem to stern.

08:36.834 --> 08:38.800
Your two favorite parts.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.734
-Are we ready?
-I reckon so.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.100
How do I look?

08:53.166 --> 08:55.767
They won't be able
to take their eyes off you.

-How's Blanche?
-She's fine.

09:35.767 --> 09:38.100
She'll be up and back on her back
in no time.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.400
Sophia, it's been wonderful watching you
take care of Blanche.

09:44.467 --> 09:47.600
-I feel like a regular hospital worker.
-That's nice.

09:47.667 --> 09:50.266
I just took the money and jewelry
from her nightstand.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.066
Where's my money, old woman?

09:56.500 --> 09:59.300
I knew that would get her up.
I was born to heal.

10:00.233 --> 10:04.400
Here's your money
and your high school ring, class of 19--

10:04.467 --> 10:05.700
Give me that.

10:07.834 --> 10:10.367
It's good to see you
back to your old self,

10:10.433 --> 10:14.633
but the doctor said
nothing strenuous for a few days.

10:14.700 --> 10:18.633
I'm not back to my old self.
I may never be.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.166
-What do you mean?
-I know this sounds crazy.

10:21.233 --> 10:23.266
If it hadn't happened to me,
I wouldn't believe it.

10:23.333 --> 10:29.266
While I was being operated on,
I had an out-of-body experience.

10:29.867 --> 10:33.734
I was floating,
looking down at myself.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.700
It was like... it was like...

10:36.767 --> 10:39.333
Like the mirror on your bedroom ceiling?

10:45.266 --> 10:49.200
It was like I was my own conscience.
Then I knew things were different.

10:49.266 --> 10:50.867
Different? How?

10:50.934 --> 10:54.333
I was in that gray area
between life and death.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.100
The time has come
for me to re-evaluate my life,

10:58.166 --> 10:59.834
to take stock of myself.

11:00.433 --> 11:04.633
I know there's a part of me
that nobody's ever seen.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.333
I find that hard to believe.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.166
If a 5,000 year old Indian shows up,

11:13.233 --> 11:15.667
tell him I want to know
more about his people.

11:17.033 --> 11:21.934
(serene music playing)

11:24.233 --> 11:26.867
Hey, guess who's on
Johnny Carson tonight?

11:26.934 --> 11:28.367
-Who?
-Johnny Carson.

11:32.433 --> 11:34.500
Must be the anniversary show.

11:36.967 --> 11:41.100
-Rose, what's that supposed to be?
-A flab stimulator.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.567
You hook this to your muscles.

11:45.633 --> 11:49.266
They give out an electric charge
and get rid of fat.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.867
Does it come in a hat?

11:56.867 --> 11:59.533
-Where's Blanche?
-Out on a date with Simon.

11:59.600 --> 12:03.100
It's her first time out,
so who knows when she'll be home?

12:03.567 --> 12:05.500
Check-out time is usually noon.

12:09.100 --> 12:12.867
Blanche has been without
a date for weeks.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.233
I know that because all the pictures
on my wall are straight.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.633
Hey, it's never easy to go without.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.633
When my mother-in-law stayed with Sal
and me when we were first married,

12:26.700 --> 12:29.834
for two months your father and I didn't
have sex.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.433
-Why not, Ma?
-She slept in-between us.

12:34.867 --> 12:36.333
It was a very small place.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.500
Have you ever seen an Italian
after he's gone without?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
No.

12:41.066 --> 12:43.266
That's because your father
was the only one.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.734
Well, she finally left, didn't she,
Sophia?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.233
Yeah. I'll never forget that day.

12:48.567 --> 12:53.133
Your father stayed home from work.
Unfortunately, I couldn't get the day off.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.200
I don't know what he did,
but he was happy when I got home.

12:59.066 --> 13:02.633
Since Charlie was a traveling salesman,
sometimes I'd be alone for weeks.

13:03.033 --> 13:06.467
I used to have so much trouble sleeping,
I tried counting sheep.

13:06.533 --> 13:10.900
Rose, if there are real sheep
in this story, I do not want to hear it.

13:12.533 --> 13:13.600
Okay.

13:18.734 --> 13:21.934
-Hi.
-Simon, good to see you again.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
How have you been?

13:23.066 --> 13:27.633
-A little lonely, but I'm better now.
-Oh, that's sweet.

13:27.700 --> 13:31.367
I cannot believe
how much I've missed this little girl.

13:31.433 --> 13:33.166
This guy is growing antlers.

13:36.166 --> 13:38.166
I guess I'd better say good night.

13:39.700 --> 13:45.767
-I had a very nice time.
-You mean, uh... our date is over?

13:46.100 --> 13:49.500
We went to dinner and a movie.
What's left?

13:49.834 --> 13:50.967
I never know.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.567
I'm sorry. I'm just not ready yet.
You understand.

13:56.633 --> 13:59.800
Of course, as long as that's
my only choice.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.033
I've had a life-altering experience,
Simon.

14:03.100 --> 14:07.934
I need time to think, to gather
my priorities and put them in perspective.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.667
Whatever you need.
I'll call you tomorrow?

14:11.266 --> 14:12.266
Sure.

14:16.467 --> 14:19.100
-You're not upset, are you?
-No, no, no, no.

14:20.700 --> 14:24.000
Boy, what a beautiful night.
Think I'll push the car home.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.000
-Your date is over?
-You sound surprised.

14:31.066 --> 14:35.834
Well, it's just that your dates usually
end with a little pillow talk.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.633
Like, "what did you say
your name was?"

14:41.800 --> 14:44.800
I would have expected my best friends
to understand.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.367
I'm just not ready yet.

14:46.433 --> 14:49.467
The doctor said you could do everything
you did before.

14:49.533 --> 14:52.667
That's very well for him to say.
The doctor's not me.

14:52.934 --> 14:56.867
-Blanche, what are you saying?
-I've made a decision.

14:57.767 --> 15:00.000
Blanche Devereaux is giving up sex.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.734
What does that do
to the morale of our boys overseas?

15:10.667 --> 15:16.734
(calm music playing)

15:18.100 --> 15:20.500
Good news, I've gained 4 pounds.

15:23.967 --> 15:26.166
How is that good news?

15:26.233 --> 15:29.367
It means those weight-loss
products don't work.

15:29.867 --> 15:34.300
Now to lose those 4 pounds
I'll have to eat sensibly.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.834
The St. Olaf I-can't-believe-
this-is-cheese diet.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.767
-How does it work?
-You eat nothing but rice.

15:47.433 --> 15:52.133
Good morning, ladies.
Dorothy, a popsicle stick purse for you,

15:52.200 --> 15:54.533
Sophia, a popsicle stick potpourri box,

15:54.600 --> 15:58.033
and for you, Rose,
two lovely popsicle stick earrings.

15:59.133 --> 16:02.467
So, Blanche, how are we enjoying
our celibacy?

16:02.533 --> 16:05.133
Let me get a popsicle.
I'll be right with you.

16:06.867 --> 16:10.500
Blanche, that's all you've been living
on for two weeks.

16:10.567 --> 16:13.567
If I don't eat the popsicle,
how will I get the stick?

16:14.533 --> 16:16.266
I'm glad you found a hobby,

16:16.333 --> 16:19.734
but I don't think
Blanche Devereaux is going to be happy

16:19.800 --> 16:23.467
making things from popsicle sticks
instead of making love.

16:23.533 --> 16:26.734
I don't care about that anymore.
I don't care about anything anymore.

16:26.800 --> 16:27.967
Life has no meaning.

16:29.233 --> 16:30.734
So, who's for popcorn?

16:39.100 --> 16:42.533
I don't know what to expect of myself
with this thing in me.

16:42.867 --> 16:46.600
I just keep remembering how you're not
supposed to overload electrical outlets.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.233
Maybe you just shouldn't
make love when you're wet.

16:56.600 --> 17:00.467
It was not an easy decision,
but it's best that I retire

17:00.533 --> 17:02.633
from the sexual arena undefeated.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.400
Time I hung up my gloves.

17:05.467 --> 17:08.367
Gloves? Boy, you do practice safe sex.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.767
Sex is only good when your heart is in it.

17:16.233 --> 17:18.433
That's the one organ I can't count on.

17:18.867 --> 17:21.133
Oh, come on, Blanche. You don't know that.

17:21.934 --> 17:24.734
If that's how you feel,
maybe you should tell Simon

17:24.800 --> 17:27.200
so he'll know where he stands.

17:27.266 --> 17:30.000
For two weeks
he's been standing with his legs crossed.

17:33.700 --> 17:34.967
I will. I'll tell him tonight.

17:39.066 --> 17:43.233
I can't believe it.
Blanche has gone without for two weeks.

17:43.633 --> 17:46.633
I mean, that's like Raymond Burr
saying "no gravy."

17:48.734 --> 17:51.066
What do you think's the matter with her?

17:51.133 --> 17:53.066
Maybe when she had
that out-of-body experience,

17:53.133 --> 17:55.200
she didn't get back in all the way.

18:02.233 --> 18:04.533
Try to discuss science with kids.

18:07.667 --> 18:12.133
(serene music playing)

18:16.400 --> 18:17.667
Um...

18:18.900 --> 18:22.867
-I want to thank you for a lovely evening.
-I didn't think you noticed.

18:22.934 --> 18:24.734
You hardly said a word all evening.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.800
-Where are the other girls?
-They all went to a movie.

18:29.867 --> 18:33.467
That's why we came back here.
I wanted us to be alone.

18:33.533 --> 18:37.133
-Ooh, baby. What?
-Um... here.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.934
I don't really know how to say this.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.734
I never thought I'd be saying this
in my wildest dreams,

18:44.800 --> 18:47.100
and you know how wild they can get.

18:47.934 --> 18:49.500
What I'm trying to tell you, Simon...

18:50.000 --> 18:54.800
the last time we made love...
was the last time.

18:56.367 --> 18:59.166
Guess it's just lucky
that we took those snapshots.

19:04.066 --> 19:06.133
What are you talking about?

19:07.266 --> 19:10.367
I'm giving up the physical side
of my life.

19:10.433 --> 19:11.567
After what I've been through,

19:11.633 --> 19:15.300
I cannot trust myself
to climb the heights of passion anymore,

19:15.367 --> 19:18.100
'cause I can't be sure
of ever getting back again.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.667
I know you have
to be concerned about the pacemaker.

19:22.734 --> 19:23.900
Wouldn't you be?

19:24.600 --> 19:27.266
Blanche, everyone I know over 50...

19:27.934 --> 19:30.700
over 40... has a pacemaker.

19:30.767 --> 19:34.734
They all lead perfectly normal lives
in every way, Blanche.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.600
But this is in me.

19:37.467 --> 19:41.133
For the first time in my life,
I'm just scared of intimacy.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.000
Maybe it's my fault.
I've been pushing you.

19:44.066 --> 19:45.333
It's not you.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.400
Blanche, you're the same person
that you always were.

19:48.767 --> 19:52.533
-You have to believe that.
-Oh, I want to, Simon...

19:52.967 --> 19:54.367
and I have tried...

19:55.266 --> 19:56.734
but I can't.

19:57.433 --> 19:59.767
Darling, this is not the time

19:59.834 --> 20:02.600
for your vivid imagination
to give out on us.

20:03.233 --> 20:04.367
Goodbye, Simon.

20:06.033 --> 20:09.633
Well, if you're going to kiss me off,
I want my kiss.

20:29.100 --> 20:32.367
-Are you all right?
-I think so.

20:32.433 --> 20:34.000
I don't feel any sparks.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.467
Well, in this instance,
I'll take that as a compliment.

20:37.867 --> 20:41.533
Am a little hot,
but it's nothing I can't handle.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.667
-What did you expect to happen?
-I don't know.

20:44.734 --> 20:48.567
I kept seeing those cartoon characters
with the smoke coming out of their ears.

20:49.533 --> 20:50.900
I don't see anything.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.800
Listen, there's a great big
old television set back in my bedroom.

20:57.266 --> 21:00.000
What do you say we go in there
and turn it off?

21:01.166 --> 21:04.500
As long as you understand
I can't make any promises.

21:04.967 --> 21:07.100
If you'll be brave, I'll be brave.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.800
Ma, I said I was sorry.

21:14.867 --> 21:18.433
When we see a movie, you could at least
say it's a foreign film.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.100
What is the big deal?

21:20.166 --> 21:22.700
I had to stand in front of the screen
to read the subtitles.

21:22.767 --> 21:25.767
All that running back and forth
to complete a sentence almost killed me.

21:30.667 --> 21:33.400
Wasn't that Simon's car
parked out front?

21:33.467 --> 21:34.567
Are you sure?

21:36.967 --> 21:38.300
Blanche?

21:42.467 --> 21:43.767
She's not in here.

21:43.834 --> 21:47.533
Maybe she had trouble with her pacemaker,
and she called him.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.200
Oh, my God.

21:52.867 --> 21:54.667
