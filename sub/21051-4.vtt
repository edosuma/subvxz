it disappeared after

29:18.256 --> 29:20.132
20 plus countries

29:20.133 --> 29:23.010
were reported as being part
of a botnet attack

29:23.011 --> 29:26.555

29:26.556 --> 29:31.394
This seems to be of such
a magnitude that it was‐‐
this was after the election.

29:31.395 --> 29:35.272

US attack on Russia's

30:44.009 --> 30:47.011
I mean, you have Mr. Biden,
first of all, who says,

30:47.012 --> 30:49.263
we will attack Russia
in the same manner

30:49.264 --> 30:51.307

in this election.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.018
We're sending a message.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.271
We have the capacity to do it

30:57.272 --> 30:58.981

that have the greatest impact.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.821

seconded that.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.949
I think there is no doubt

31:08.950 --> 31:14.580
that when any foreign government
tries to impact

31:14.581 --> 31:15.831
the integrity of our elections

31:15.832 --> 31:20.336
that... we need to take action.

And we will, at a time and place

some of it may not be.

31:30.263 --> 31:34.058
Um, but Mr. Putin is
well aware of my feelings
about this,

31:34.059 --> 31:35.643
because I spoke
to him directly about it.

So something happened

32:26.319 --> 32:29.280
Well, you're making

of how much money

we have invested
in cyberwarfare
and our cybercommand,

32:33.368 --> 32:35.244

a serious threat to me.

32:35.245 --> 32:37.872
I have the feeling
that he's playing it down,

32:37.873 --> 32:39.665
because something did happen,

32:39.666 --> 32:41.917
and he doesn't want
to reveal it,

32:41.918 --> 32:45.213
and... because
of sensitive relations.

32:53.263 --> 32:55.973
No. I'm worried that,
you know, I would hate‐‐

32:55.974 --> 32:59.476

can lead to a hot war.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.772

33:03.773 --> 33:07.359
The Stuxnet virus came
very close to creating chaos
in the world.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.738
I think this is
very dangerous,
very dangerous,

33:10.739 --> 33:12.657

we're playing with fire.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.619

in its way as
what happened in 1945

33:32.510 --> 33:34.136

33:34.137 --> 33:35.457

and then you, you knocked out

44:14.026 --> 44:16.862
or derailed several of them,
by your own.

44:16.863 --> 44:20.240
You told me that story,
that you had a meeting,
uh, in Moscow,

44:20.241 --> 44:22.909
and you made the point
in this meeting that

44:22.910 --> 44:25.913
there was a responsibility
to the people and to the state.

44:27.039 --> 44:28.790
So, uh, the Western elite says

44:28.791 --> 44:34.546
that you have put
your oligarchs into the power

44:34.547 --> 44:36.715
in these last 15 years.

44:36.716 --> 44:40.260
Whereas these old oligarchs
are sitting in places
like London.

44:40.261 --> 44:42.513
They admit that they've
accumulated great wealth...

44:43.598 --> 44:47.350
but they say that
you've lead them
to the wealth

44:47.351 --> 44:48.977
and that you've shared in it,

44:48.978 --> 44:52.981
that you are, in fact,
the single richest person
in the world.

44:52.982 --> 44:54.400
(translator speaking)

44:55.818 --> 44:59.905
Not since, uh, Rockefeller,
Morgan, or Onassis or‐‐

44:59.906 --> 45:01.865
You may laugh,
and I appreciate it.

45:01.866 --> 45:08.246
But as a leader of your people,
like, uh, Chavez or Castro,
or many other people

45:08.247 --> 45:10.665
who've been accused
of corruption,

45:10.666 --> 45:15.421
is there some way you could make
your personal wealth clearer?

45:31.854 --> 45:35.358
(translator speaking)

47:32.350 --> 47:34.517
Stone:
So, there is, uh,

47:34.518 --> 47:36.394
no bank accounts in Cyprus.

47:36.395 --> 47:37.980
(chuckles)

47:40.358 --> 47:42.568
I would imagine.

47:45.321 --> 47:48.281
Well, I have to say
from personal observation
that, uh,

47:48.282 --> 47:51.535
I would have a hell
of a lot more fun
if I was rich.

48:01.670 --> 48:03.130
(Stone laughs)

48:48.050 --> 48:52.887
If you run again in 2018
and you win,

48:52.888 --> 48:57.225
you will be in power
another six years, till 2024.

48:57.226 --> 49:02.480
You would have been in power
as president and prime minister

49:02.481 --> 49:06.609
for 24 years,
longer than Roosevelt,

49:06.610 --> 49:10.238
less than Castro,
who was close to 50 years,

49:10.239 --> 49:14.576
and close to Stalin,
who was, give or take, 30 years.

49:14.577 --> 49:18.496
Now, 27 years.

49:18.497 --> 49:20.457
Does that not scare you?

49:20.458 --> 49:23.793
Do you not get used to power?

49:23.794 --> 49:26.755
Uh, does it distort
your point of view?

49:28.174 --> 49:31.843
Do you feel that Russia
needs you that badly?

49:31.844 --> 49:35.305
Can there not be
a healthy competition

49:35.306 --> 49:38.224
among successors
inside the system?

49:38.225 --> 49:41.811
The Chinese one‐party system
being an example,

49:41.812 --> 49:44.439
of competition within the party.

49:44.440 --> 49:46.858
The successors are checked out

49:46.859 --> 49:50.154
for many years as party members
in different provinces.

49:56.285 --> 49:58.412
Yes, that's true.

50:53.842 --> 50:56.095
I understand that.
I said "if."

50:57.846 --> 51:01.307
If‐‐ (chuckles)...

51:01.308 --> 51:04.352
And of course, no matter what,
you know, um,

51:04.353 --> 51:08.565
democracy itself,
whatever we call it,
is flawed.

51:08.566 --> 51:11.526
And America's system is,
is hardly perfect.

51:11.527 --> 51:13.945
We know that money
buys power in America.

51:13.946 --> 51:16.781
Certainly Russia has
a flawed system.

51:16.782 --> 51:20.451
It is very like‐‐ unlikely
that the next election
will convince the world

51:20.452 --> 51:24.581
that, uh, this is a democracy,
a functioning democracy,

51:24.582 --> 51:27.333
unless international monitors
were brought in,

51:27.334 --> 51:29.711
as Mr. Chavez did
in Venezuela.

51:29.712 --> 51:33.465
And it became
a really transparent process.

51:43.559 --> 51:46.894
That is a dangerous
argument, because, uh...

51:46.895 --> 51:48.563
it works both ways.

51:48.564 --> 51:53.735
Those who abuse power always say
it's a question of survival.

51:53.736 --> 51:55.237
(translator speaking)

52:57.132 --> 53:02.595
Mr. Putin, I don't doubt
for one moment your love
and pride in serving Russia.

53:02.596 --> 53:04.931
It is clear that you are
a son of Russia to me

53:04.932 --> 53:07.475
and that you've done
very well by her.

53:07.476 --> 53:10.937
But I think we all know
the price of power.

53:10.938 --> 53:12.063
And when we're in power,

53:12.064 --> 53:16.693
too long, no matter what,
we feel the people need us,

53:16.694 --> 53:19.737
but at the same time,
we've changed,

53:19.738 --> 53:22.449
and we don't even know it
sometimes, or recognize it.

53:39.550 --> 53:41.051
Okay.

53:42.344 --> 53:44.804
So, uh, what time is it?

53:44.805 --> 53:46.639
(man speaks)

53:46.640 --> 53:49.684
(laughing)

53:49.685 --> 53:50.686
Thank you,
Mr. Putin.
