WEBVTT

00:45.920 --> 00:47.255
(chatter)

00:47.338 --> 00:47.672
MORE EGGS ANYONE?

00:47.756 --> 00:49.966
YES, ME PLEASE.

00:50.049 --> 00:51.509
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT VICTOR?

00:51.593 --> 00:55.180
{\an1}HE FELL DOWN THE STAIRS LAST
NIGHT AND BROKE HIS LEG.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.474
DON'T EXAGGERATE PATRICIA.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.558
EGGZ...AGGERATE!
NICE ONE TRUDES.

00:58.641 --> 01:01.853
TERRIBLE...YOKE... ALFIE.

01:01.936 --> 01:04.355
IT'S A SPRAINED ANKLE THAT'S
ALL.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.691
A VERY PAINFUL SPRAINED ANKLE.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.402
VICTOR! HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

01:09.486 --> 01:10.737
AND WITH A LIMP TOO...

01:10.820 --> 01:13.072
SOMEONE SABOTAGED THAT
FLOORBOARD ON PURPOSE.

01:13.156 --> 01:17.285
OH NO. THAT FLOORBOARD'S BEEN
LIKE THAT FOR AGES.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.996
I REMEMBER TELLING YOU ABOUT IT
LAST YEAR.

01:20.079 --> 01:22.540
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, I'VE TRIPPED
OVER IT MYSELF A FEW TIMES.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.750
I HAVEN'T.

01:23.833 --> 01:29.047
SOMEONE IS UP TO SOMETHING.

01:29.130 --> 01:33.676
AND I INTEND TO FIND
OUT WHAT IT IS.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.013
AND WHO.

01:40.558 --> 01:44.229
{\an4}VICTOR IS ONTO US AND I DON'T
THINK WE SHOULD GO UP TO THE
ATTIC AGAIN FOR A WHILE.

01:44.312 --> 01:45.396
{\an3}WE HAVE TO.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.190
THAT KEY OPENS SOMETHING FABIAN.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.692
{\an3}I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT I KNOW I WANT TO KNOW.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.528
YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEONE
SO SWEET AND POLITE,

01:51.611 --> 01:53.071
YOU'RE QUITE A RISK-TAKER.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.989
{\an3}ONLY WHEN IT'S WORTH
THE RISK.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.785
{\an6}VICTOR KNOWS THE KEY IS MISSING,
I HEARD HIM TALKING TO TRUDY
LAST NIGHT.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.371
{\an3}SO WE WON'T HAVE MUCH
TIME TO USE IT...

02:01.454 --> 02:04.123
(monster noises)

02:07.794 --> 02:09.711
{\an1}AMBER WAS DRIVING ME CRAZY LAST
NIGHT.

02:09.795 --> 02:12.882
IT WAS MICK THIS AND MICK THAT.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.384
{\an3}IT'S SWEET THAT THEY'RE BACK
TOGETHER AGAIN THOUGH.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.718
AHEM.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.054
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

02:18.137 --> 02:19.138
NOTHING.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.890
YOU LIKE HIM DON'T YOU?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.892
NO! EWW!

02:22.976 --> 02:25.019
I CAN TELL, YOU'RE BLUSHING.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.522
WELL... HE IS ATTRACTIVE.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.232
AH I KNEW IT!

02:29.315 --> 02:31.150
{\an4}AND WE STARTED TO GET ON REALLY
WELL WHEN WE WERE DOING HOMEWORK
TOGETHER.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.445
{\an3}SO YOU WERE HAPPY WHEN YOU HEARD
THEY HAD SPLIT UP?

02:34.529 --> 02:36.865
{\an1}WELL, I WAS SORRY FOR AMBER,
OBVIOUSLY.

02:36.948 --> 02:42.161
{\an1}BUT, IF I'M BEING HONEST,
YES I WAS.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.330
{\an1}I'M JUST NOT SURE AMBER'S
RIGHT FOR HIM.

02:44.414 --> 02:49.210
{\an1}THEY'VE GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
IN COMMON.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.344
WHY THE LONG FACE?

02:58.428 --> 03:01.097
WELL LET ME SEE,

03:01.180 --> 03:04.100
I'M GOING TO AMBER AND MICK'S
"GETTING BACK TOGETHER" PARTY.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.602
AND - YOU STILL OWE ME A TWENTY.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.478
I'VE TOLD YOU - PATIENCE.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.940
I WILL DELIVER. I JUST NEED A
LITTLE BIT LONGER THAT'S ALL.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.442
BUT IN THE MEANTIME LOOK,

03:12.525 --> 03:16.279
{\an1}THERE ARE GIRLS IN THERE SO GET
YOUR BEST PARTY GEAR ON,

03:16.362 --> 03:17.989
GET READY TO DAZZLE.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.490
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO WEAR.

03:21.659 --> 03:24.329
{\an3}I NOTICE YOU'VE BEEN A BIT
NICER TO NINA RECENTLY.

03:24.412 --> 03:27.457
{\an1}YEAH. WELL, I SUPPOSE I
REALISE NOW,

03:27.540 --> 03:29.667
{\an1}IT WAS JUST A CO-INCIDENCE
AFTER ALL.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.128
{\an1}YOU KNOW, HER TURNING UP
THE DAY JOY LEFT.

03:32.211 --> 03:33.963
{\an1}BUT, I DON'T TOTALLY TRUST
HER THOUGH.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.715
WHY? BECAUSE SHE'S AMERICAN?

03:35.798 --> 03:39.552
SHE'S VERY... SECRETIVE.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.346
SHE SNEAKED OUT THE OTHER NIGHT.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.889
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WENT,

03:42.972 --> 03:45.475
{\an1}BUT SHE BROUGHT SOMETHING BACK
AND HID IT UNDER THE BED.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.311
{\an1}IN FACT, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A
CHANCE TO HAVE A LOOK.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.646
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.

03:49.729 --> 03:50.980
GUARD THE DOOR MARA.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.982
{\an1}DON'T GO THROUGH HER STUFF
PATRICIA!

03:53.066 --> 03:55.318
JUST GUARD THE DOOR WILL YOU.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.613
{\an4}FINE, BUT SOME DAY YOU HAVE
TO GIVE ME A JOB OTHER THAN
GUARDING.

03:58.696 --> 04:01.157
HMM, TWO KEYS.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.327
{\an1}THIS ONE'S THE ONE FROM THE
ATTIC THE OTHER NIGHT.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.664
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT ONE IS.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.666
{\an1}OHHH LOOK, SHE KEEPS HER
DIARY IN HERE AS WELL.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.834
DON'T READ IT!

04:11.918 --> 04:14.045
JUST A LITTLE PEEK.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.171
HEY LISTEN TO THIS.

04:15.254 --> 04:19.050
{\an1}(American accent)
"FABIAN IS KINDA GEEK CHIC.

04:19.132 --> 04:21.511
HE'S REALLY SWEET TO ME."

04:21.886 --> 04:24.138
FABIAN - "SWEET"?

04:24.222 --> 04:27.725
WHAT ELSE DOES SHE SAY?

04:28.851 --> 04:34.440
{\an1}"PATRICIA IS POSSIBLY THE
MEANEST PERSON I HAVE EVER MET!"

04:34.524 --> 04:37.276
WHAT A COW!

04:37.360 --> 04:39.237
I DID WARN YOU NOT TO READ IT.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.573
{\an1}AND AFTER I WAS NICE TO HER
THAT ONE TIME AS WELL.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.159
(shuffling noises at the door)

04:48.037 --> 04:48.705
HI.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.581
HI.

04:50.665 --> 04:51.749
THE PARTY'S STARTED.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.377
{\an1}ALFIE'S DOWN THERE TEACHING
TRUDY HOW TO POP AND LOCK IT.

04:54.460 --> 04:58.423
{\an1}YEAH, WE WERE JUST GOING DOWN
WEREN'T WE PATRICIA?

04:58.506 --> 05:01.592
OK

05:06.639 --> 05:08.474
LOOK WHAT I'VE GOT.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.519
{\an6}YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY
THINKING ABOUT GOING UP
THERE NOW ARE YOU?

05:11.602 --> 05:13.104
MHMM

05:13.187 --> 05:14.480
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.941
{\an6}I THOUGHT WE SAID WE NEEDED TO
CHOOSE OUR MOMENTS MORE
CAREFULLY.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.819
{\an1}AND THIS IS IT! VICTOR WON'T
BE PROWLING;

05:19.902 --> 05:22.905
{\an1}HE'LL WANT TO AVOID THE PARTY.
SO LET'S GO.

05:22.989 --> 05:27.785
{\an4}UNLESS ALFIE'S DRACULA
COSTUME IS ALL THE FRIGHT
YOU CAN HANDLE?

05:27.869 --> 05:29.746
YOU ARE VERY PERSUASIVE.

05:29.829 --> 05:33.875
{\an3}ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO IT.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.884
WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE?

05:42.967 --> 05:43.760
BOTH OF THEM.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.011
SHALL WE ASK THEM TO DANCE?

05:45.094 --> 05:46.888
{\an1}TO DANCE? ALFIE STOP IT,
STOP DANCING!

05:46.971 --> 05:50.099
NO, NO, NO, NO. ALFIE,

05:50.183 --> 05:51.350
{\an1}WE ARE NOT GOING TO ASK
THEM TO DANCE.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.186
OK, NO SWEET MOVES.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.479
SO WHAT DO I DO?

05:54.562 --> 05:57.106
{\an1}I WANT YOU TO COME UP WITH AN
IRRESISTIBLE PICK UP LINE.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.024
{\an3}SUCH AS?

05:58.107 --> 06:00.318
{\an1}<i>BABE, IF I COULD RE-ARRANGE THE</i>
<i>ALPHABET,</i>

06:00.401 --> 06:02.445
<i>I'D PUT U AND I TOGETHER.</i>

06:02.528 --> 06:04.322
HEY MAN, YOU ARE GOOD.

06:04.405 --> 06:04.822
{\an1}THANK YOU.

06:04.906 --> 06:05.698
THAT'S LIKE POETRY.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.617
GO ON THEN.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.619
OK.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.579
I'VE GOT IT!

06:11.662 --> 06:15.041
HA HA GOOD LUCK.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.669
(slap)

06:18.753 --> 06:21.172
EURGH!!!

06:21.255 --> 06:21.506
(laughing)

06:21.589 --> 06:24.842
ALFIE!

06:24.926 --> 06:28.888
(laughing)

06:28.971 --> 06:32.809
WHAT WAS YOUR LINE?

06:32.892 --> 06:33.976
FANCY A BITE?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.937
(laughing)

06:58.042 --> 07:00.044
HIDING IN THE KITCHEN?

07:00.128 --> 07:01.003
{\an1}OH, HI.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.923
{\an1}NO, JUST PUTTING SOME MORE
DIPS AND STUFF OUT.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.174
{\an3}I'LL TAKE SOME IN FOR YOU
IF YOU LIKE.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.009
THANKS.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.595
{\an3}I KNOW I HAVENÃ­T SPOKEN TO YOU
PROPERLY SINCE...

07:09.679 --> 07:10.513
YOU KNOW...

07:10.596 --> 07:12.265
{\an1}THE FRIENDSHIP BRACELET
INCIDENT?

07:12.348 --> 07:13.808
{\an3}YEAH.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.017
{\an6}I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE IF I
MADE THINGS AWKWARD BETWEEN YOU
AND AMBER.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.770
NO, I THINK WE'RE COOL NOW.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.355
{\an3}GOOD.

07:19.438 --> 07:20.356
{\an3}LOOKS GOOD.

07:20.439 --> 07:24.986
{\an1}(laughs) DO YOU EVER STOP
THINKING ABOUT FOOD?

07:25.778 --> 07:26.612
HI MICK.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.489
{\an3}HI AMBS.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.074
WE SHOULD CUT THE CAKE IN A
MINUTE BOO.

07:30.158 --> 07:35.079
ERM...I'LL GO THROUGH.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.165
{\an3}I WANT YOU TO KEEP YOUR PAWS OFF
MY BOYFRIEND.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.125
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:39.208 --> 07:40.918
OH DON'T PLAY THE INNOCENT MARA.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.378
I KNOW YOU LIKE HIM.

07:42.461 --> 07:43.588
I HEARD YOU TELLING PATRICIA.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.214
{\an3}YOU WERE JUST FLIRTING
WITH HIM NOW.

07:45.298 --> 07:45.882
I...I WASN'T.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.884
HEY WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:47.967 --> 07:49.635
PATRICIA, DO YOU WANNA SWAP
ROOMS WITH ME?

07:49.719 --> 07:50.887
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE SHARING
WITH NINA

07:50.970 --> 07:55.474
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO
SHARE WITH MARA ANY MORE.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.854
(whispers) WHAT ABOUT THIS?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.821
(gasps)

08:09.155 --> 08:10.948
WHAT ARE THESE?

08:11.032 --> 08:14.035
I HAVE NO IDEA.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.995
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

08:16.078 --> 08:18.164
IT'S REALLY OLD.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.249
{\an3}HEY! MY UNCLE IS AN
ANTIQUES DEALER.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.793
{\an3}I BET IF WE TOOK THE
STUFF TO HIM,

08:22.877 --> 08:24.754
{\an3}HE'D BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT WAS.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.089
{\an1}I DON'T THINK THAT'S SUCH A
GOOD IDEA DO YOU?

08:27.173 --> 08:28.883
SARAH WAS SO SECRETIVE.

08:28.966 --> 08:29.759
(loud thump)

08:29.842 --> 08:31.844
WHAT WAS THAT?

08:31.928 --> 08:33.011
SSSH!

08:33.095 --> 08:34.388
{\an3}I THINK IT WAS JUST A DOOR
SLAMMING DOWNSTAIRS.

08:34.472 --> 08:38.142
{\an1}OK WELL I'VE HAD ENOUGH
SPOOKINESS FOR ONE NIGHT.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.477
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE PARTY.

08:40.561 --> 08:41.604
{\an1}I'M GOING TO PUT THESE
SOMEWHERE SAFE.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.231
OK.

08:51.364 --> 08:58.496
(music playing)

09:08.714 --> 09:12.426
(music stops)

09:25.773 --> 09:28.693
(music starts again)

09:33.197 --> 09:36.325
(knock knock)

09:36.409 --> 09:37.827
I WONDERED WHERE YOU WERE.

09:37.910 --> 09:38.577
YOU MISSED THE CAKE.

09:38.661 --> 09:42.373
OH YEAH. SORRY.
UM, WAS IT GOOD?

09:42.456 --> 09:44.208
IS THAT A JEWELLERY BOX?

09:44.292 --> 09:45.167
UM, SORT OF.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.045
OH I LOVE JEWELLERY.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.046
{\an3}CAN I SEE?

09:49.130 --> 09:51.632
NO, NO, ERM...YOU
WOULDN'T LIKE IT.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.510
{\an1}IT'S NOTHING EXPENSIVE OR
SPARKLY.

09:54.593 --> 09:55.928
{\an1}REALLY.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.764
{\an6}I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO BE A
BIT FRIENDLIER WHEN WE
BECOME ROOMIES.

09:58.848 --> 09:59.724
WHAT?

09:59.807 --> 10:01.726
{\an3}I'M SWAPPING ROOMS WITH PATRICIA
-

10:01.809 --> 10:03.060
WE'LL BE SHARING FROM NOW ON.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.771
REALLY? THAT'S GREAT!

10:05.855 --> 10:08.524
WAIT, WAS THIS PATRICIA'S IDEA?

10:08.607 --> 10:15.615
{\an3}NO, MINE. I HAD A FIGHT
WITH MARA.

10:16.741 --> 10:20.453
{\an1}SO, ABOUT THAT CHOCOLATE CAKE...
ANY LEFTOVERS?

10:20.536 --> 10:25.041
TRUDY'S CAKE IS TO DIE FOR...

10:43.184 --> 10:46.103
I KNEW IT...

10:52.068 --> 10:55.279
(owl hoot)

10:55.363 --> 11:02.161
(party music playing)

11:02.578 --> 11:07.666
{\an1}NINA, DO YOU...
DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.585
YEAH SURE,

11:09.668 --> 11:15.174
{\an4}BUT I'M GOING TO APOLOGIZE IN
ADVANCE FOR THE DAMAGE I AM
ABOUT TO DO TO YOUR FEET.

11:15.257 --> 11:23.182
HEY! GUESS WHAT I AM? A PARTY
ANIMAL. YEAAAAH! RARR RARRR!

11:26.018 --> 11:27.269
YOU'RE SO DUMB ALFIE.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.397
{\an3}<i>ENOUGH!</i>

11:29.480 --> 11:32.525
TURN THAT RACKET OFF.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.610
âªmusic stopsâª

11:34.693 --> 11:38.239
ANYONE WHO DOESN'T
LIVE HERE OUT!

11:38.322 --> 11:40.032
THE PARTY IS OVER!

11:40.116 --> 11:42.118
AND YOU...

11:42.201 --> 11:48.207
{\an4}HOW DARE YOU MESS ABOUT WITH
THAT? TAKE IT OFF YOUR HEAD
IMMEDIATELY.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.625
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

11:49.708 --> 11:52.294
{\an5}I CAN'T. IT'S STUCK.

11:49.708 --> 11:52.294
(everyone laughs)

11:52.378 --> 11:55.965
STOP LAUGHING!

11:56.048 --> 12:01.470
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF
YOU VERMIN.

12:01.554 --> 12:05.808
{\an1}WHO HAS GOT THE SPARE KEY TO
THE ATTIC? HMM?

12:05.891 --> 12:11.730
{\an4}I KNOW SOMEBODY'S BEEN UP
THERE... TONIGHT AS A
MATTER OF FACT. OH YES.

12:11.814 --> 12:18.904
{\an4}YOU THINK YOU'RE ALL SO
CLEVER, BUT YOU ARE NOT AS
CLEVER AS ME. WHO HAS IT?

12:18.988 --> 12:21.782
{\an1}IT'S REALLY HOT IN HERE. I
CAN'T BREATHE.

12:21.866 --> 12:25.870
{\an1}WELL THEN WE SHALL JUST HAVE
TO SAW IT OFF SHAN'T WE?

12:25.953 --> 12:26.745
{\an1}<i>SAW!!???</i>

12:26.829 --> 12:30.166
OH YES. THE REST OF YOU,
WAIT THERE!!!

12:30.249 --> 12:34.128
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

12:35.421 --> 12:38.507
{\an4}<i>ACTUALLY, I THINK THIS HEAD</i>
<i>QUITE SUITS ME. MAYBE I'LL</i>
<i>JUST KEEP IT?</i>

12:38.591 --> 12:43.971
{\an3}SIT DOWN.

12:44.054 --> 12:47.516
{\an4}<i>AND MAYBE THE LADIES WILL GO</i>
<i>FOR THE WHOLE HALF MAN, HALF</i>
<i>ANIMAL THING?</i>

12:47.600 --> 12:49.602
<i>IT SEEMS TO WORK FOR THAT</i>
<i>JACOB BLACK DUDE.</i>

12:49.685 --> 12:54.607
<i>AND AMBER LOVES HIM...</i>

12:54.690 --> 12:58.194
{\an1}BRUTE FORCE IS THE ONLY WAY.
THIS MIGHT HURT.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.697
{\an5}<i>MAYBE IF YOU COULD LOOK</i>
<i>SLIGHTLY LESS HAPPY ABOUT</i>
<i>IT..?</i>

13:01.780 --> 13:05.242
{\an1}WHAT'S GOING ON? VICTOR,
STOP IT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:05.326 --> 13:08.204
{\an4}WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M
DOING? I'M RELEASING AN
IDIOT.

13:08.287 --> 13:12.583
{\an5}VICTOR, WE DON'T WANT TO
BE SENDING ALFIE HOME
MINUS HIS EARS.

13:12.666 --> 13:18.547
NO. WE NEED SOAP.
WAIT THERE.

13:33.145 --> 13:39.944
{\an1}<i>(VICTOR SPEAKING) STUPID,</i>
<i>STUPID, STUPID, STUPID.</i>

13:52.665 --> 13:54.833
(FLOORBOARD CREAK)

14:04.552 --> 14:06.971
YOU MUST HAVE DROPPED THIS.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.431
I FOUND IT BY THE DOOR.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.059
{\an1}RIGHT, THIS SHOULD DO THE
TRICK.

14:12.142 --> 14:17.898
{\an4}NOW, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO GET HYSTERICAL THIS
TIME ARE YOU?

14:17.982 --> 14:18.816
YOU LEFT IT ON THE FLOOR?

14:18.899 --> 14:21.443
{\an1}I KNOW IT'S NOT THE BEST
IDEA IN THE WORLD.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.613
{\an1}BUT IF HE HAS IT, HE
CAN'T SEARCH US FOR IT.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.573
TRUST ME, GUYS.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.658
{\an1}AND WHY SHOULD WE TAKE THE
RAP FOR YOU?

14:27.741 --> 14:29.326
WHY?

14:29.410 --> 14:32.871
{\an4}BECAUSE YOU GUYS WERE THE
ONES WHO MADE NINA STEAL THE
KEY IN THE FIRST PLACE!

14:32.955 --> 14:38.586
{\an1}<i>OH YES, VERY CLEVER. VERY</i>
<i>CLEVER INDEED HMM?</i>

14:38.669 --> 14:43.966
{\an1}WHO PUT THIS ON THE FLOOR
OUTSIDE MY OFFICE? HMM? WHO?!

14:44.049 --> 14:45.217
- WAS IT YOU?
- NO.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.093
- YOU?
- NO.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.261
- YOU?
- NO.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.387
I'M LOSING PATIENCE.

14:48.470 --> 14:49.430
- MICK?
- NO.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.016
- YOU TWO?
- (together) NO.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.893
- YOU?
- NO.

14:54.977 --> 14:55.436
YES!

14:55.519 --> 14:56.604
AH-AH!

14:56.687 --> 14:57.605
NO,.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.649
{\an1}SHE'S COVERING FOR ME.
I DID IT.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.483
YOU?

15:01.567 --> 15:04.194
YES. GUILTY AS CHARGED.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.238
NO. HE'S LYING. IT WAS ME.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.198
{\an1}MAKE YOUR MINDS UP. WHO WAS
IT?

15:08.282 --> 15:10.492
ME. I DID IT.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.619
WHAT?

15:11.702 --> 15:14.788
I DID IT. TOTAL KEY THIEF.

15:14.872 --> 15:18.208
{\an1}ACTUALLY. HE'S LYING. IT WAS
ME, VICTOR.

15:18.292 --> 15:22.963
OH YEAH. I MEAN NO. IT
WASN'T HER. IT WAS ME.

15:23.047 --> 15:27.051
i LOVE TO STEAL KEYS SO MUCH.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.638
ACTUALLY, IT WAS ME.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.932
STOP PLAYING ME FOR A FOOL.

15:34.016 --> 15:43.734
{\an1}JEROME, I KNOW I CAN RELY ON
YOU. WHO WAS IT?

15:46.987 --> 15:49.031
(REGRETTABLY) IT WAS ME.

15:49.114 --> 15:53.535
THAT IS IT. THAT IS IT!

15:53.619 --> 15:58.999
{\an1}YOU ARE ALL GROUNDED FOR THE
ENTIRE WEEKEND.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.799
(they all laugh)

16:08.300 --> 16:13.097
{\an1}AH, DON'T TELL ME, YOU DID
IT AS WELL! HMM?

16:13.180 --> 16:14.723
{\an3}NO WAY!

16:14.807 --> 16:15.724
{\an3}DID WHAT?

16:15.808 --> 16:18.060
{\an1}YOU ARE GROUNDED THE SAME AS
THE REST OF THEM.

16:18.143 --> 16:22.439
AND AS FOR YOUR OTHER
LITTLE ESCAPADE. HMM?

16:22.523 --> 16:23.565
AW NO, NOT THE TOOTHBRUSH.

16:23.649 --> 16:29.196
{\an1}I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE MY
FACE IN THAT TOILET BOWL.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.161
{\an1}I'D LOVE TO SEE YOUR FACE IN
THAT TOILET BOWL.

16:36.245 --> 16:41.041
{\an1}ALFIE, DON'T BE SO
DISRESPECTFUL. COME ON.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.292
{\an1}SO SINCE WE WERE ALL
GROUNDED,

16:42.376 --> 16:45.921
{\an1}GUESS WHO USED THE EXTRA TIME
TO STUDY THOSE HIEROGLYPHICS..?

16:46.004 --> 16:47.005
AND?

16:47.089 --> 16:48.799
{\an1}NOTHING. TOTAL DEAD END.
IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T EXIST.

16:48.882 --> 16:52.094
THE INTERNET HAS JUST
NEVER HEARD OF THEM.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.971
I WAS HOPING IT WAS GOING
TO BE LIKE BEFORE -

16:54.054 --> 16:57.141
WHEN THE SYMBOLS LED US
TO THE 8TH STEP.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.351
{\an1}THINGS WERE SO MUCH SIMPLER
BACK AT THE LAST CLUE.

16:59.435 --> 17:04.857
{\an4}HAVE YOU THOUGHT ANY MORE
ABOUT TAKING ALL OF THIS
STUFF TO MY UNCLE?

17:05.357 --> 17:09.028
HOW ELSE ARE WE GOING TO
FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE?

17:09.111 --> 17:11.195
OKAY. LUNCHTIME.

17:13.824 --> 17:17.286
UNCLE ADE? UNCLE ADE!

17:17.368 --> 17:19.788
CUSTOMERS, HOW WONDERFUL!

17:19.872 --> 17:22.124
I HAVEN'T HAD A CUSTOMER
ALL WEEK.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.791
{\an1}WE'RE NOT CUSTOMERS UNCLE
ADE, IT'S ME, FABIAN.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.961
HENCE THE "UNCLE" GREETING.

17:26.044 --> 17:30.048
NO. NO, NO THAT'S
NOT FABIAN.

17:30.132 --> 17:36.221
OH YES. SO IT IS. I MUST
GET SOME NEW GLASSES.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.682
AND WHO IS THIS FAIR
MAIDEN BESIDE YOU?

17:38.766 --> 17:40.267
COULD IT BE YOUR
GIRLFRIEND PERCHANCE?

17:40.350 --> 17:44.062
{\an1}NO, NO, NO. THIS IS NINA,
SHE'S JUST A FRIEND.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.607
{\an5}DON'T THEY TEACH YOU
ANYTHING USEFUL AT THAT
SCHOOL OF YOURS?

17:46.690 --> 17:49.568
{\an4}FIVE YEARS HE'S BEEN THERE
AND I CAN COUNT ON THE FINGERS
OF ONE HAND

17:49.651 --> 17:52.112
{\an1}THE TIMES HE'S BEEN TO VISIT HIS
DUSTY OLD UNCLE.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.822
{\an1}IT'S NOT RIGHT IS IT YOUNG
LADY?

17:53.906 --> 17:56.492
I TRY TO STAY OUT OF
FAMILY CONFLICTS.

17:56.575 --> 18:00.204
{\an4}ESPECIALLY AS I MAKE THE
BEST LEMONADE IN THE ENTIRE
UNIVERSE.

18:00.287 --> 18:03.540
{\an1}WOULD YOU LIKE A GLASS? AND
HOW ABOUT SOME LUNCH?

18:03.624 --> 18:06.752
{\an1}I'VE MADE SOME BUBBLE
AND SQUEAK.

18:06.835 --> 18:09.046
I'LL TRY ANYTHING ONCE,

18:09.129 --> 18:12.424
{\an4}EVEN THOUGH IT'S NAMED
AFTER THE GUINEA PIGS I HAD
WHEN I WAS FIVE...

18:12.508 --> 18:14.760
{\an5}BUBBLE AND SQUEAK IS AN
ENGLISH DELICACY. YOU'LL
LOVE IT.

18:14.843 --> 18:18.472
COME THROUGH. TELL ME HOW
I CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.683
{\an1}SO WHY HAVE YOU SWAPPED
ROOMS WITH PATRICIA?

18:21.767 --> 18:23.811
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE
WITH NINA ANY MORE.

18:23.894 --> 18:24.645
AND MARA?

18:24.728 --> 18:26.313
WHO CARES WHAT SHE THINKS.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.940
{\an1}I THOUGHT YOU TWO WERE
FRIENDS.

18:28.023 --> 18:32.110
{\an4}HARDLY. WE'VE GOT ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING IN COMMON. UNLIKE YOU
AND ME, BOO.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.529
YEAH.

18:33.612 --> 18:37.115
SO, UH...WHAT DO WE
HAVE IN COMMON?

18:37.199 --> 18:39.368
{\an1}WE BOTH LIKE GOING OUT WITH
GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE?

18:39.451 --> 18:40.828
YEAH WE DO!

18:40.911 --> 18:41.537
{\an1}HI!

18:41.620 --> 18:43.038
OH HI.

18:43.121 --> 18:44.915
{\an1}IS AMBER STILL NOT TALKING
TO YOU?

18:44.998 --> 18:47.960
{\an4}UNLESS YOU COUNT WHEN SHE TOLD
EVERYONE TO SHUT UP AT
BREAKFAST

18:48.043 --> 18:49.711
{\an1}AND I WAS IN THE
ROOM...

18:49.795 --> 18:52.881
DON'T WORRY. SHE'LL COME
AROUND.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.050
AAAGH! IT'S NOT IN HERE!

18:55.134 --> 18:56.635
WHAT'S NOT THERE?

18:56.718 --> 19:01.807
{\an4}MY FRENCH TEXT BOOK. I'M
GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK AND
GET IT. I WON'T BE LONG.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.725
<i>HOW EXCITING.</i>

19:03.809 --> 19:07.479
{\an4}THESE ARE PHONOGRAPHIC
CYLINDERS AND IN EXTREMELY
GOOD CONDITION TOO.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.189
{\an1}WHAT ARE PHONOGRAPHIC
CYLINDERS?

19:09.273 --> 19:13.235
{\an4}WELL, THESE ARE EXACTLY THE
SAME KIND OF THING AS MINI
CASSETTES,

19:13.318 --> 19:15.279
{\an1}ONLY FROM THE BEGINNING
OF THE 20TH CENTURY.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.573
{\an1}YOU MEAN, THERE'S SOMETHING
RECORDED ON THOSE THINGS?

19:17.656 --> 19:18.824
{\an1}THERE COULD VERY
WELL BE, YES.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.243
{\an5}DO YOU HAVE A MACHINE
WE COULD PLAY THEM ON
UNCLE ADE?

19:21.326 --> 19:25.539
{\an4}UNFORTUNATELY, NO. BUT I
THINK I HAVE A PICTURE OF
ONE SOMEWHERE.

19:25.622 --> 19:26.248
I'LL GO AND
HAVE A LOOK.

19:26.331 --> 19:29.751
{\an1}NOW IT'S OVER HERE
SOMEWHERE.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.254
(HE BURPS)

19:32.337 --> 19:35.924
HERE WE ARE, YES.

19:36.008 --> 19:41.096
THERE, EDISON'S PHONOGRAPH.

19:41.179 --> 19:42.973
{\an1}(WHISPERING) YOU KNOW WHERE
WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

19:43.056 --> 19:46.018
(WHISPERING) THE ATTIC.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.854
{\an1}OHH...THAT'S NOTHING. COULD
I HAVE IT?

19:48.937 --> 19:53.108
INTRIGUING. VERY INTRIGUING.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.402
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

19:55.485 --> 19:57.029
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.280
{\an3}OH.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.489
{\an4}DO YOU THINK I COULD KEEP
IT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS
I COULD?

19:59.573 --> 20:02.534
{\an1}NO ACTUALLY, IT'S UM...
IT'S MY GRANDAD'S.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.621
{\an1}PERHAPS HE COULD TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT IT'S HISTORY?

20:05.704 --> 20:09.124
NO. HE'S DEAD.

20:09.207 --> 20:12.211
{\an4}YOU AND MY NEPHEW REALLY
ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER
AREN'T YOU?

20:12.294 --> 20:15.172
{\an5}ANYWAY, MUST BE OFF
UNCLE ADE WE'RE DUE
BACK AT SCHOOL NOW.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.798
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP.

20:16.882 --> 20:17.674
YEAH, THANK YOU.

20:17.758 --> 20:18.675

WANT SOME MORE?

20:18.759 --> 20:19.676
WE'LL JUST BE OFF.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.929
{\an1}UM OH

20:22.387 --> 20:24.598
{\an1}SO HAS THE WHOLE JOY ISSUE
GONE AWAY THEN?

20:24.681 --> 20:28.393
{\an3}OH YES.

20:28.769 --> 20:32.397
YES, WE HAVEN'T HEARD A PEEP
OUT OF ANY OF THEM FOR DAYS.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.066
YOUR PHONE-CALL
DID THE TRICK.

20:34.149 --> 20:37.819
{\an1}ARE YOU SERIOUSLY STILL WORRIED
THE BETRAYER MIGHT RETURN?

20:37.903 --> 20:41.240
WE CAN TAKE NO RISKS.

20:41.323 --> 20:45.202
ANYWAY, IT'S OVER
NOW. FINISHED.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.705
JOY IS BURIED.
END OF STORY.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.417
SO LET US GET ONTO THE
BUSINESS IN HAND BROTHER,

20:52.501 --> 20:55.337
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE
NEXT GATHERING?
