00:09.218 --> 00:10.969
Ba-bum.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.514
[croaks]

00:14.723 --> 00:15.891
[panting]

00:17.643 --> 00:19.811
[Ezran] <i>Previously on </i>The Dragon Prince...

00:20.354 --> 00:24.816
Every one of these men and women
would gladly trade their life

00:24.900 --> 00:26.360
to save yours.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.195
Would you, Viren?

00:28.278 --> 00:29.321
[scoffs]

00:31.073 --> 00:35.202
I'm here for the king, and I'm also here
for his son, Prince Ezran.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.538
Wait! You need to see something.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.123
It can't be.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.917
[Callum] The egg. It wasn't destroyed.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.879
[Viren] Moonshadow elves are dangerous,
elite fighters.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.757
Under a full moon,
they become nearly invisible.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.842
And they can penetrate any defense.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.845
Nothing in the five kingdoms
can stop them.

00:54.388 --> 00:58.141
When it is done, I will send a shadowhawk
with a blood ribbon message

00:58.225 --> 00:59.601
to the Queen of the Dragons.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.895
We strike when the moon is highest.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.274
[theme music playing]

01:20.581 --> 01:21.832
[roaring]

03:10.982 --> 03:13.068
This may be the end.

03:13.151 --> 03:13.985
[Pip chirps]

03:14.736 --> 03:19.282
-Aw, who gives the best birdie kisses?
-[Pip squawks]

03:19.366 --> 03:20.200
Pip does.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.243
[Pip chitters]

03:24.162 --> 03:28.041
But I don't understand.
The switching spell will save his life.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.418
Why would he say no?

03:29.501 --> 03:31.628
King Harrow is a principled man.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.879
You mean "stubborn."

03:33.463 --> 03:34.464
Watch your tongue.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.217
But, yes, he is hardheaded.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.054
Usually about the right things,
but about this... [sighs]

03:41.596 --> 03:42.597
I don't know.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.977
You look so... happy in this portrait.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.062
I was.

03:50.272 --> 03:54.025
We posed for this a few days
after King Harrow's coronation.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.946
He insisted I stand next to him
for the painting...

03:59.281 --> 04:02.576
because he knew I would
stand by him through anything.

04:03.785 --> 04:04.786
And you have.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.247
So far, yes.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.380
I have to stand by him through this, too.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.718
I need to be the man
he once believed I was.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.595
What does that mean, Dad?

04:22.179 --> 04:26.099
It means there's one more thing
I can do to convince him.

04:26.725 --> 04:27.976
What are you doing?

04:28.059 --> 04:30.520
If I told you, you would try to stop me.

04:31.104 --> 04:35.525
So, shouldn't I just try to stop you then,
even without knowing?

04:37.694 --> 04:38.987
Goodbye, Claudia.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.639
Ugh. Persimmon?

05:15.524 --> 05:16.733
[snaps fingers]

05:30.997 --> 05:33.166
This changes everything.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.170
So, this is it?
The egg of the Dragon Prince?

05:37.671 --> 05:40.632
I can't believe it. If the egg lives...

05:40.715 --> 05:42.050
Maybe it could stop the war.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.518
He's okay in there. I can feel it.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.772
But how?
[stammers] Why wasn't it destroyed?

05:55.855 --> 05:57.983
[Claudia] Because my father saved it.

05:58.066 --> 05:58.942
[Callum] Claudia!

05:59.025 --> 06:00.860
Callum, Ezran, get behind me.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.572
I can protect you from the elf.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.324
Your father didn't save it. He stole it.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.784
That's a lie!

06:07.867 --> 06:10.161
Then, Claudia, why is it here?

06:10.245 --> 06:16.334
My father took it to protect us, Callum,
so the elves and dragons couldn't use it.

06:16.418 --> 06:19.087
What are you talking about?
How can we use it?

06:19.170 --> 06:20.839
Don't play dumb!

06:20.922 --> 06:22.549
You know it's a powerful weapon.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.302
It's not a weapon. It's an egg!

06:25.927 --> 06:28.221
Ezran, don't be afraid.

06:28.305 --> 06:31.349
Walk towards me,
and if she moves even an inch...

06:33.226 --> 06:35.145
[energy crackling]

06:37.897 --> 06:40.525
Just bring that thing here.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.485
It's not a thing!

06:42.569 --> 06:45.780
It has a mother,
and it needs to go back to her.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.367
You're right. It wants its mother.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.869
Ezran, be careful.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.253
Follow me.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.008
Don't worry, I won't hit Ez.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.011
<i>Fulminis--</i> Ah!

07:10.764 --> 07:12.223
Callum, what are you doing?

07:12.307 --> 07:13.934
The right thing. I hope.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.603
I'm sorry, Claudia.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.938

07:55.183 --> 07:56.226
[growling]

07:59.229 --> 08:00.480
[Callum] There's something after us.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.316
Keep running.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.277
[Ezran] Wait, not that way.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.113
-Why not?
-[thuds]

08:08.947 --> 08:10.740
-Because it's a dead-end.
-[groans]

08:25.005 --> 08:27.340
I can't stop them. They're just smoke.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.883
My swords pass right through.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.093
[wolves growling]

There might be something I can do,
but I don't know if I can do it.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.154
Is this a guessing game? Just do it!

08:54.659 --> 08:56.202
<i>-Aspiro.</i>
-[wind howls]

09:04.294 --> 09:05.295
You did it!

09:05.378 --> 09:07.422
You never mentioned you were a mage.

09:07.505 --> 09:11.051
Who, me? No, I'm...
I'm not really anything.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.385
You just did magic.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.721
Yeah, that's what a mage is.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.765
You're a mage.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.892
Oh. Really?

09:19.476 --> 09:21.352
Wow! I'm a mage!

09:22.020 --> 09:23.354
[yelling] I'm a mage!

09:23.438 --> 09:26.858
[shushing] Nobody likes a loud mage.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.568
Sorry. Sorry.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.944
[whispers] I'm a mage!

09:46.753 --> 09:48.713
So, what's in the basket?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.173
A bigger moth?

09:50.799 --> 09:54.344
It's something that will protect the king
when all your swords have failed.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.555
Uh, you...
You know they can hear you, right?

09:58.223 --> 09:59.057
He knows, sir.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.852
I am prepared to do anything
to protect the king.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.145
Anything.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.106
I hope you will understand.

10:09.651 --> 10:10.819
[croaking]

10:17.158 --> 10:19.160
Listen, I need you to give me the egg.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.538
I have to get it to the roof, right away.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.789
What? Why?

10:22.872 --> 10:24.541
Just trust me.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.584
Right, right. That makes sense.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.877
Since we go way back.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.212
Like that one time, ten minutes ago,

10:29.295 --> 10:31.798
when you chased me through the castle
trying to stab me?

10:31.881 --> 10:33.550
[laughs] Good times.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.427
You might not realize it,
but I'm trying to help you.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.680
Any moment now, others will be arriving.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.014
Others like me.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.016
Assassins.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.521
I need to show them the egg to stop them.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.730
Just give it to me.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.486
-[croaks]
-I'll take you to the roof.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.172
I've given thought to what you said.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.172
Oh, have you?

11:16.926 --> 11:20.805
Then why have you returned
with that abomination?

11:20.889 --> 11:22.849
Yes, I've brought the soulfang.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.476
I have a proposal. Let me explain.

11:26.603 --> 11:27.437
Go on.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.189
[sighs]

11:30.273 --> 11:31.774
You are my king...

11:32.442 --> 11:34.110
but you are also my friend.

11:34.736 --> 11:35.945
Your friend?

11:36.029 --> 11:36.946
Yes.

11:37.572 --> 11:41.576
Right now, I do not
come to you as my king.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.495
I think of you... as my brother.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.332
I see the problem now.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.751
It's that you believe you are special,

11:49.834 --> 11:53.922
better than everyone else,
above the laws of this kingdom.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.090
That's not what I was trying to say.
Please, listen.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.384
Assassins are coming to murder me tonight,

11:58.468 --> 12:00.595
and you're wasting
what precious time I have left.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.763
No, Harrow, I--

12:01.846 --> 12:02.680
Stop.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.474
How about, "No, Your Highness."

12:04.557 --> 12:08.645
In fact, let's try, "Yes, Your Highness"
for a change.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.065
Oh, are you sure you wouldn't prefer
"Your Royal Highness"?

12:12.148 --> 12:15.109
"Your Esteemed Inimitable Majesty,"
perhaps?

12:15.193 --> 12:18.029
I have tolerated your arrogance
for too long,

12:18.112 --> 12:19.739
maybe even encouraged it.

12:19.822 --> 12:25.119
But if today is my last day as king,
you will know your place.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.789
And where exactly is that place?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.666
Right here.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.336
On... your... knees.

12:39.926 --> 12:43.346
You are a servant
of the kingdom of Katolis.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.391
You are a servant.

12:48.935 --> 12:49.769
[squawks]

12:58.695 --> 12:59.696
You're here.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.406
I know you are.

13:03.157 --> 13:03.992
[Runaan] Rayla.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.871
You defied me.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.124
Runaan, you need to call off the mission.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.376
You've lost your mind.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.836
Please, listen to me.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.170
I've found something.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.089
The egg of the Dragon Prince.

13:18.756 --> 13:19.924
That's impossible.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.468
The egg wasn't destroyed, it was stolen.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.721
Their High Mage
was going to use it for dark magic,

13:24.804 --> 13:27.640
but the human princes found it,
and they're only trying to help--

13:27.724 --> 13:30.435
No. Humans are liars.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.228
This is a trick and a trap.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.521
You're a fool, Rayla.

13:33.604 --> 13:34.814
She's not a fool.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.692
What she's telling you is true.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.154
You've made a terrible mistake.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.947
Ez, show him.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.163
[stammers] It's beautiful.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.750
How can we take vengeance
for an act that never happened?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.084
You have to call it off.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.545
Rayla, you know it doesn't work that way.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.338
We bound ourselves.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.174
There's only one way to release.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.800
Runaan, please.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.635
There has to be another way.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.013
This is a miracle, a chance for peace.

14:07.096 --> 14:10.475
The humans struck down
the King of the Dragons.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.727
Justice will not be denied.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.062
Now, give me the egg.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.939
Callum, Ezran, go.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.608
-But--
-Just keep it safe.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.372
Don't do this.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.625
I will kill you.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.626
Probably.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.172
[swords clanging]

14:43.674 --> 14:46.886

Well, fun as it would be
to turn the chains into snakes,

15:01.442 --> 15:03.152
I guess I'll just use the key.

15:06.197 --> 15:07.698
[panting]

15:10.868 --> 15:12.995
You need to stay here, hidden.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.163

15:14.247 --> 15:16.374
-Keep the egg safe.
-[croaks]

15:16.457 --> 15:17.834
I'll go talk to the king.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.421
Callum, why don't you just call him "Dad"?

15:21.963 --> 15:23.256
Because he's the king.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.259
And I'm his stepson.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.010
I think he would want you to.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.679
If you wanted to.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.390
I don't know about that.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.225
Be right back.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.444
Whoa, slow down there, step-prince.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.820
The king's pretty busy right now.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.114
Trying not to, you know, die and stuff.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.449
You're not stopping me.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.410
You should not be here.

No, not really.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.637
You've had about 20 years more training.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.764
Not your fighting skills.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.975
-I mean your character.
-[grunts]

16:33.242 --> 16:34.368
You saw the egg.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.496
There's no need for vengeance tonight.

16:40.958 --> 16:41.959
[panting]

16:46.881 --> 16:48.716
You're just trying to stall me.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.676
Interesting theory.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.802
Care to discuss?

16:52.428 --> 16:54.347
Your justice will come later.

16:55.890 --> 16:56.974
[Rayla] No, wait!

16:59.435 --> 17:00.603
[Callum] <i>I know what you did.</i>

17:00.686 --> 17:02.939
You stole the egg of the Dragon Prince.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.066
We found it, and we're keeping it safe.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.150
"We"?

17:06.234 --> 17:09.153
The king will have you in shackles
when he finds out about this.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.949
What makes you so sure
he doesn't already know?

17:13.866 --> 17:15.159
Grab him.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.494
But he's the Prince.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.453
Do it!

17:19.830 --> 17:20.665
[yelps]

17:22.333 --> 17:23.626
Now, tell me.

17:24.168 --> 17:25.878
Where is the egg?

17:25.962 --> 17:28.172
I'll call out. I'll scream.

17:28.256 --> 17:29.257
Go ahead.

17:32.677 --> 17:33.886
[chanting]

17:47.400 --> 17:48.234
[wheezes]

18:19.098 --> 18:20.224
[thuds]

18:33.613 --> 18:36.240
This one's not so good at hiding.

18:36.324 --> 18:37.575
[croaks]

18:38.159 --> 18:39.410
I told him that.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.121
Uh, where's your brother?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.248
He went up to the tower to see our dad.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.878
Oh, no. That's the last place
he should be right now.

18:50.338 --> 18:53.966
You impudent little mongrel.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.470
You were spoiled and given everything...

18:57.553 --> 19:00.806
and that has left you weak and helpless.

19:00.890 --> 19:07.146
Tonight, your world is changing,
and there is nothing you or anyone can--

19:07.229 --> 19:08.230
[wind howling]

19:18.407 --> 19:19.408
They're here.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.038
[exclaims]

19:27.875 --> 19:28.876
Defend the doors!

19:40.429 --> 19:41.430
[exclaims]

19:42.598 --> 19:43.599
[swords clanging]

19:52.942 --> 19:53.776
[coughs]

19:57.655 --> 19:58.614
King Harrow!

20:02.243 --> 20:03.160
Dad!

20:13.671 --> 20:14.672
[Ezran] Callum!

20:18.509 --> 20:19.802
Callum, where are you?

20:21.846 --> 20:22.722
Callum!

20:33.607 --> 20:34.692
[panting]

20:36.068 --> 20:36.944
[grunts]

20:38.738 --> 20:39.780
[grunts]

20:49.874 --> 20:52.376
Callum. Did you talk with Dad?

20:52.460 --> 20:53.836
[swords clanging in distance]

20:58.340 --> 21:01.218
Say the word and I'll go back
into that tower with you.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.225
No. It's up to us now.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.020
We have to return this egg.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.732
We have to keep it safe
and carry it to Xadia.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.734
And find its mother.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.236
We could change things.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.863
We could make a difference.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.364
Just the three of us.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.282
[croaks]

21:25.075 --> 21:27.077
[stammers] The four of us.

21:48.766 --> 21:51.018
[Ezran] Callum, do you think
Dad will be okay?

21:52.019 --> 21:54.897
He has the finest guards
in the kingdom defending him.

21:54.980 --> 21:55.815
Yeah.

21:57.358 --> 21:58.526
Yeah, of course.

22:06.367 --> 22:07.493
[panting]

22:37.189 --> 22:39.567
<i>Regina Draconis!</i>

22:44.488 --> 22:45.406
[screeching]

23:01.338 --> 23:02.756
Finish this.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.508
My pleasure.

23:04.592 --> 23:09.096
No. We can find
more practical uses for this one.

23:09.847 --> 23:10.931
Tie him up.

23:39.627 --> 23:40.586
[Callum] What's going on?

23:41.378 --> 23:42.713
Something's wrong.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.214
No, it's...

23:45.049 --> 23:46.508
We should stop and rest soon.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.303
It's a long journey to Xadia.
