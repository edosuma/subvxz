00:00.261 --> 00:02.306
- Previously,
on "Winter House"...

00:02.350 --> 00:04.178
- And so it begins,
Craig.

00:04.221 --> 00:05.657
- The best
winter vacation ever.

00:05.701 --> 00:06.745
You better get ----ed up,
and you better have fun.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.312
- Yeah.
- If you don't, go home.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.749
- House credo!
- Cheers.

00:10.793 --> 00:13.056
- I don't know how we're
gonna make it 17 days, though.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.319
- I don't either, man.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.060
- So, I invited
my friend, Julia.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.322
You're gonna love her.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.324
And I was like,
"Invite whoever you want."

00:22.196 --> 00:23.806
- This sounds like
a recipe for disaster.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.331
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
I'm Paige.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.680
- Muah.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.856
My love,
I see you down there.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.728
- Don't start something
you can't finish.

00:32.771 --> 00:35.165
- This is our first vacation...
- Vacation.

00:35.209 --> 00:36.427
- ...since we got engaged.
- I know.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.081
It was a long time coming.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.170
- I want
the primary bedroom,

00:40.214 --> 00:42.346
and I will share it
with Ciara.

00:42.390 --> 00:45.175
- I'm just over this sh--.
- Oh, God.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.437
- Oh, Kyle's gettin' hammered.
I love it.

00:46.481 --> 00:47.699
- Kyle!

00:47.743 --> 00:50.354
If this is the way that
Kyle's gonna act,

00:50.398 --> 00:51.616
I want nothin'
to do with it.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.401
- Gabby, what's the shortest
amount of time

00:53.444 --> 00:55.316
you've known someone
before ----in' 'em?

00:55.359 --> 00:56.839
- Twenty-four hours.
- That's a long time.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.321
I respect her
so much more.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.149
- You look good, babe.
- I wish I was there.

01:02.192 --> 01:03.498
I just have to, like,
finish up

01:03.541 --> 01:05.282
some last minute
work stuff.

01:05.326 --> 01:07.415
- Linds and I talk
all the time.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.330
I don't know
what's gonna happen,

01:09.373 --> 01:12.376
you know, between us
but, like, let's go.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.117
Are you ----ing
kidding me?

01:14.161 --> 01:15.640
That's my ex.

01:15.684 --> 01:19.122
- There's this tether that
holds him to Charleston.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.732
Dude, just go talk
to Ciara.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.647
If you can't get over your ex
in this environment,

01:22.691 --> 01:24.214
then that's on you.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.607
- I'll share a room with you,
if we have to. Yeah.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.130
- I don't have to
twist your arm.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.566
- Are you into Austen?

01:28.610 --> 01:30.394
- Guys that get me with
their humor is just, like,

01:30.438 --> 01:31.526
it's a good time, always.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.269
- Whoo!

01:35.312 --> 01:36.574
- Let's go in the hot tub.

01:38.924 --> 01:40.448
- What the ----in' sh--
is this?

01:40.491 --> 01:41.927
- Oh, my gosh.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.800
- I'm walking into, like,
a full-blown orgy.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.685
- This is next level,
man.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.170
- Ow, sh--!

02:07.214 --> 02:08.476
- Don't step on the candy.

02:10.826 --> 02:13.263
- Should we go upstairs
to the group?

02:13.307 --> 02:14.395
We did what we came to do.

02:14.438 --> 02:15.874
- Let's just sit here.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.270
Congrats to us.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.490
- Right. Beautiful girls.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.409
- I feel like, this is like,
a first date, or something.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.280
I mean, it's just a kiss.
- Well, it is.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.586
You're gonna write
in your journal about this.

02:31.629 --> 02:32.935
- I'm excited.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.502
- I think I'm in love.

02:40.508 --> 02:41.552
- Thank you.

02:43.467 --> 02:44.555
- Wanna shotgun a beer?

02:44.599 --> 02:45.643
- Are you biting it?

02:45.687 --> 02:47.341
- Come on.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.212
- Guys, we need to,
like, establish

02:49.256 --> 02:50.779
who is, like, cooking
and who is cleaning.

02:50.822 --> 02:53.477
- Everyone who bangs tonight
has to clean the kitchen.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.784
- I wanna have so much sex
in this house.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.351
- Oh, your big dick mode.

02:57.394 --> 03:00.180
- Dude, Amanda's, like,
uh, no.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.661
- This is ----in' my speed,
right here.

03:03.705 --> 03:04.793
This is what
I'm all about.

03:04.836 --> 03:05.881
- This is, like,
what my family and I do.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.709
- No sh--?
- Missouri, yeah.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.232
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.668
Did you grow up in--
in the city?

03:10.712 --> 03:12.670
- I was raised on, like,
not a farm,

03:12.714 --> 03:14.019
but my mom's restaurant
had a farm,

03:14.063 --> 03:15.543
so I have horses.
- Oh, that's dope. Yeah.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.980
- And we had cows,
and then my step-dad taught me

03:18.023 --> 03:19.808
how to shoot my first gun.
- Yeah, I grew up hunting.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.331
I mean, I was--
I was, like,

03:21.375 --> 03:23.464
I was probably this tall
shootin' guns.

03:23.507 --> 03:26.728
- I like guys that don't mind
getting their hands dirty.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.425
- If I need to, I can
catch fish out of my lake

03:28.469 --> 03:29.513
and eat 'em.
I can, like, hunt.

03:29.557 --> 03:30.688
I can live.
- That's smart.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.255
Luke is that man.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.562
He could live in a tent
and be satisfied,

03:34.605 --> 03:36.390
and...

03:37.739 --> 03:39.567
- Jason, can I ask you
a question?

03:39.610 --> 03:42.265
Who is your person
of interest?

03:42.309 --> 03:43.484
Do you have a person
of interest?

03:43.527 --> 03:44.789
- I'm very curious.
I want the tea, too.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.531
- I will say Gabby.

03:47.575 --> 03:50.708
- Oh.
- Where is she, right now?

03:50.752 --> 03:51.840
- That's a great question.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.145
- Here's a blanket,
by the way.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.582
If you're cold,
you can wrap this around ya.

03:54.625 --> 03:55.844
I don't want you to freeze.
It is a little chilly.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.019
- I'm... thank you.
- Yeah.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.848
- I feel, like,
still really embarrassed.

03:59.891 --> 04:02.459
- Oh, my God, don't.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.244
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

04:06.681 --> 04:09.423
- Holy sh--.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.911
- When did you first
come to America?

04:26.004 --> 04:27.049
- What's your
favorite movie?

04:27.963 --> 04:32.446
- It's hard.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.582
- Yeah, 'cause you're like,
"Let's start a new show."

04:38.626 --> 04:39.888
I get it.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.455
- I have to pee, now.
- We can just go in.

04:45.023 --> 04:45.807
- I'm done.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.421
- Ow, ow.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.336
- What the-- the heck?

04:53.380 --> 04:54.468
- Babe.
- What?

04:54.511 --> 04:57.035
- I'm not doing the sex

04:57.079 --> 04:59.951
with the friends
in the next doors.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.608
- Craigers.

05:07.872 --> 05:08.873
- Good night.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.135
- Wait.
Will you hit that lamp?

05:10.179 --> 05:11.311
- Yeah.
- Please.

05:13.704 --> 05:14.662
- Can I take
your pants off?

05:14.705 --> 05:16.664
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, buddy.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.600
- I'm definitely making you
a fire.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.689
- You are? Thanks.
- How are you feelin'?

05:41.732 --> 05:43.168
- I isolate myself,
so it's like,

05:43.212 --> 05:44.822
I'm happy in my head.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.911
I'm just mellow.
That's just how I am.

05:46.955 --> 05:47.999
- Oh, yeah.
Okay, yeah.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.131
- Do you know if
you got sour cream?

05:49.174 --> 05:51.089
- If it was on the list,
it was got.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.830
I don't wanna
disappoint you.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.485
Okay.
- Oh, you're so loving.

05:57.879 --> 06:00.838
- [BLEEP]! The emails are--
are comin' in.

06:00.882 --> 06:03.014
I've never actually unplugged
on a vacation.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.496
I'm a little stressed out
with work.

06:06.540 --> 06:09.673
I'm always feeling like
I could take Loverboy

06:09.717 --> 06:12.067
to the next level if I just
put in the extra time

06:12.110 --> 06:13.416
and effort.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.591
How we doin'?
- Good.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.027
- I started
lots of companies,

06:16.071 --> 06:18.421
and, you know,
I thought long and hard

06:18.465 --> 06:21.598
about what am I
most knowledgeable about.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.731
It's alcohol.
Enter Loverboy.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.040
- Yeah, it sucks to be
running out of product

06:29.084 --> 06:30.128
in the Hamptons.

06:30.172 --> 06:31.826
I don't have
an off switch.

06:31.869 --> 06:36.221
That's why I need to let loose
and get drunk.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.832
Not that I have a problem

06:37.875 --> 06:40.008
but, like, I have a problem
actually stopping working.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.186
- I could eat soup for
every meal of my life.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.580
- It's amazing.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.451
- Why did you spend three hours
outside in the cold

06:48.495 --> 06:50.497
last night with Luke?

06:50.540 --> 06:52.542
Did you guys have
some deep conversation?

06:52.586 --> 06:53.978
- Yeah, we did.

06:54.022 --> 06:56.720
It was nice getting to know
a different side of him.

06:56.764 --> 06:59.462
Yeah,
that's pretty much it.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.159
- There he is.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.552
- Good morning.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.033
All right, bacon time.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.038
Yeah.

07:10.081 --> 07:12.475
- Good morning.
- Hi.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.520
- Come on in, pumpkin.
- Wanna get in the bed? Yeah.

07:13.563 --> 07:14.216
- I'm, like,
where you guys been?

07:14.259 --> 07:15.913
- You look so cute.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.785
I made out with Andrea
in the hot tub.

07:20.004 --> 07:22.485
- Yo!

07:22.529 --> 07:24.139
- What's up?

07:24.182 --> 07:25.880
- Andy, bro.

07:25.923 --> 07:28.491
Come on, man. Like...

07:28.535 --> 07:30.101
- We had fun last night.
- Yes, we did.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.582
- I feel like a kiss,
like, right there.

07:32.626 --> 07:33.801
Like, yes.
- Totally.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.933
How you feel?
- She's cool.

07:35.977 --> 07:38.283
Like, we talked,
so that was nice.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.634
- And then after we were
talking, I was like...

07:40.677 --> 07:41.765
- Like, you stripped
a layer away.

07:41.809 --> 07:42.940
- Yeah.
I was like, wait,

07:42.984 --> 07:45.508
I think you're actually
really great.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.032
- Yeah, he is, and he's very,
like, open when he talks.

07:48.076 --> 07:49.599
I have known Andrea
for years.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.166
I've never dated Andrea,

07:51.209 --> 07:53.734
but I've seen him
with other women,

07:53.777 --> 07:55.562
and he's a man
that gets what he wants...

07:57.738 --> 07:59.174
and this time
it's my friend,

07:59.217 --> 08:02.743
who I have known for
a little bit longer, okay?

08:02.786 --> 08:04.614
Hopefully, he doesn't
break her heart.

08:04.658 --> 08:05.920
If he does,
I'll kill him.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.053
- Puppy love.

08:09.097 --> 08:10.490
- Yeah, like,
and it doesn't hurt

08:10.533 --> 08:11.969
that he's the hottest man
I've ever seen in my life.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.144
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, it's just--

08:13.188 --> 08:14.537
it's really unfair
to other humans.

08:14.581 --> 08:15.756
- Yeah.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.279
- Oh!
- These guys.

08:17.322 --> 08:18.236
- Oh, can I have
a sip of that?

08:18.280 --> 08:19.977
- Little teenagers
over here.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.239
- He's calling us teenagers

08:21.283 --> 08:23.067
because we made out
in the hot tub. Nice.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.553
- Especially with
German girls.

08:30.597 --> 08:31.728
But, you know,
there was Austrian,

08:31.772 --> 08:33.556
there were American girls,
Dutch girls,

08:33.600 --> 08:35.863
sometimes Italian,
as well.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.170
- I do.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.171
Like, there's something
about a guy that, like,

08:40.215 --> 08:42.217
can make you laugh.
It's like--

08:42.260 --> 08:44.132
- A different connection.
- It's a different, like--

08:44.175 --> 08:45.655
- Intimacy.
- Yeah.

08:45.699 --> 08:46.961
- Oh, Lindsay is coming.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.310
It's gonna be a lot
of energy.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.616
- Yeah.

08:49.659 --> 08:50.921
- I'm excited
to meet her, though.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.314
- I'm honestly, like,
kinda nervous

08:52.357 --> 08:54.272
about how she's gonna, like,
come into the house.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.013
- I'm gonna go sleep
at a guy's house tonight,

08:56.057 --> 08:57.667
with a guy, in a bed.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.277
And how do you feel
about that?

08:59.321 --> 09:01.149
You don't get to sit here
and yell at me and--

09:01.192 --> 09:02.367
- No, you don't.
Yeah, exactly.

09:02.411 --> 09:03.630
You don't get to sit here
and yell at me.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.762
- Why are we having, like,
a committee here?

09:05.806 --> 09:07.111
- We're not having
a committee.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.286
- There's no committee.
- Well, then let's go!

09:08.330 --> 09:09.461
- Don't say, "Come on,
let's go," to me.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.028
- I don't need to walk
into a gang bang.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.334
You need to stop
----in' yellin' at me.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.857
- You're--
you're insulting me.

09:13.901 --> 09:16.033
- I'll take a lap.
You calm the down.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.339
- What are you
talking about?

09:17.382 --> 09:20.603
- How many sandwiches
have you made for me?

09:20.647 --> 09:22.213
- It's, like, we've already
been here for a few days.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.651
Like, we have a good energy,
you know. She's, like, new.

09:27.784 --> 09:30.004
- Hmm.

09:30.047 --> 09:32.049
- Dude,
Lindsay gets here today,

09:32.093 --> 09:35.226
and she still ----in'
is totally in love with you.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.402
- I don't think-- Craig thinks
that Lindsay is into me.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.187
- Do you guys know each other
for a really long time?

09:39.230 --> 09:41.668
- For-- for, like,
three years now, I guess.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.234
- What are you doin',
Austen?

09:43.278 --> 09:45.715
- I'm so stupid.

09:45.759 --> 09:46.934
I forgot my passport.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.066
I can't go to
the Bahamas now.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.851
- I think she has
a crush on Austen,

09:50.894 --> 09:52.026
and I don't think
she's gonna be happy

09:52.069 --> 09:53.157
about the Ciara thing.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.246
- Uh, no.
No, bullsh--.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.031
I think that when she comes,
I think the opposite.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.641
I think that
she's gonna be like,

09:58.685 --> 10:00.730
"Tell me everything,"
and we're gonna gab.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.993
- And then make out.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.995
I think that Lindsay
has always been into Austen

10:05.039 --> 10:07.955
and would have left
any of her boyfriends for him.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.652
I think they've hooked up
multiple times.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.742
Do either of 'em tell me that?
No, but I'm not an idiot.

10:12.786 --> 10:13.961
- I'm curious to meet her.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.661
- Do you feel okay?
- Uh, I just, like,

10:18.705 --> 10:19.706
I just have, like,
a lot of work.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.098
- Oh.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.447
- I'm gonna call my lawyer,
right now.

10:22.491 --> 10:23.666
- All right.
See ya in a bit, brother.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.668
- Nick, you there?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.278
I just saw these emails.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.324
Production can probably go
for the next two weeks

10:29.367 --> 10:30.847
at this new copacker.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.763
- These are the phone calls
I hear all day.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.288
- Kyle's bringing down
the mood.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.638
We're on vacation.

10:38.681 --> 10:43.468
You haven't taken me on a trip
in so many years,

10:43.512 --> 10:44.948
and you're working.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.429
- The-- their lawyers, uh--

10:47.472 --> 10:50.388
- It'd be wonderful to not
hear you on a phone call

10:50.432 --> 10:51.912
about Loverboy.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.000
All day, every day.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.741
- Would it be good
coming from you

10:54.784 --> 10:57.395
in terms of addressing
that other email from Paul.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.702
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

10:59.746 --> 11:02.096
- Wait. Is this, like,
a workout chic look?

11:02.139 --> 11:03.750
- No.
- Oh, okay.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.926
- Let me go take a shower,
straighten my hair.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.145
- Wait. Hold on.
Ciara?

11:08.189 --> 11:10.191
- Yeah.

11:10.234 --> 11:11.845
- Nothin'.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.281
I just wanted to
take a look at you.

11:13.324 --> 11:16.719
- That was cute, Austen.
That was so cute.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.069
- All right, everybody.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.157
Thank you.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.333
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye-bye.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.770
- That's a lot.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.859
- Well, I'll lay with you
and do a face mask.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.994
- Around the corner.
Wow.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.914
Let's get this
party started!

11:37.958 --> 11:39.524
- Hubs?

11:39.568 --> 11:40.482
- Is that Hubhouse?

11:42.353 --> 11:45.487
- Hubs!
- Ahh!

11:47.097 --> 11:48.795
- Should we say hi or wait?
- Yeah.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.013
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.319
- Oh, my gosh.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.495
- I am so happy
that we're together.

11:53.538 --> 11:56.977
- Just what our winter house
needs, a hurricane.

11:57.020 --> 11:58.500
- Hi.
- Hi, hubby.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.850
- I'm Julia. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.765
Lindsay. I'm a hugger.
- Oh.

12:02.809 --> 12:06.203
- I'm here, bitches!
Hi.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.901
Why am I such a psycho?

12:07.944 --> 12:09.424
- Finally here.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.252
- We're taking a shot
because we're in vacation mode.

12:11.295 --> 12:12.993
- Oh, Jesus.

12:13.036 --> 12:15.212
- I'm just-- I'm so excited
to be on vacation with Austen.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.562
It's been over a year
since I've seen him,

12:17.606 --> 12:20.522
and here we are single
for the first time,

12:20.565 --> 12:24.004
at the same time,
in a very long time,

12:24.047 --> 12:27.790
and I'm just happy to, like,
be with him.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.054
- Hi.
- Lindsay.

12:31.098 --> 12:33.535
- Andrea.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.798
- Lindsay.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.192
Yeah, I won't
get it on you.

12:38.235 --> 12:42.065
- Listen, we all know
single Lindsay loves Fireball.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.067
- All right.
What's your cheers?

12:44.111 --> 12:48.202
- Let's sh-- up!
- Yeah!

12:48.245 --> 12:50.247
- I took a sip.
I was like absolutely not.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.248
- I can't, right now.

12:51.292 --> 12:54.164
- Oh, my boys, my boys.

12:54.208 --> 12:57.994
- Let's get some of
this Vermont air, babe.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.822
- This is the longest time
that we have gone

12:59.866 --> 13:02.129
since we've met
without seeing each other.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.000
- I've been waiting for
your ass to get here.

13:04.044 --> 13:07.482
- Well, I'm excited to be here
with you.

13:07.525 --> 13:08.526
So, tell me
what's going on.

13:08.570 --> 13:09.832
Fill me in.
- Well, okay.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.269
Okay, okay, okay.
So, there's, like--

13:12.313 --> 13:13.575
like, let's just
jump into it.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.098
- Yeah, just tell me everything.

13:15.142 --> 13:17.144
- Uh, okay.

13:17.187 --> 13:20.103
Andy made out with Paige.
- Okay.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.931
- I made out with Ciara.

13:27.328 --> 13:28.546
- So, are you gonna
make out with her again?

13:28.590 --> 13:30.461
Are you interested?

13:30.505 --> 13:33.943
- I totally wanna
make out with her.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.640
- Coming up...

13:35.684 --> 13:37.947
- Dude, you came in hot.

13:37.991 --> 13:40.950
- I-- I--

13:40.994 --> 13:42.996
- Oh!
- Oh!

13:43.039 --> 13:44.301
- Ow.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.999
- This is my new roomie.

13:49.480 --> 13:53.397
- I made out with Ciara.

13:53.441 --> 13:54.877
- So, are you gonna make out
with her again?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.661
Are you interested?

13:56.705 --> 14:00.187
- I totally wanna
make out with her.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.405
- Oh.

14:01.449 --> 14:02.972
Is that the only girl
you made out with?

14:03.016 --> 14:05.627
- Lins, like,
I'm here to have fun.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.063
- Just have fun. Yeah.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.195
- There's, like,
no agenda whatsoever.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.544
- No.

14:09.587 --> 14:10.937
- Like, if it's all just,
like, a big lovefest,

14:10.980 --> 14:12.503
then, like,
then let it be.

14:12.547 --> 14:13.765
You know, family love.

14:13.809 --> 14:14.462
Then, like, you know,
let it be, you know?

14:14.505 --> 14:16.159
- Oh, okay.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.030
I-I didn't know if you
were talking about an orgy or--

14:17.073 --> 14:18.248
- No, right.
No, no, no.

14:18.292 --> 14:21.991
- Well, got a nice little view.

14:22.035 --> 14:24.994
- Isn't that sick?
- Yeah.

14:27.344 --> 14:28.432
- What?

14:31.609 --> 14:33.133
- I'm getting cold.
- You're cold?

14:33.176 --> 14:36.484
My balls are this big.
- And blue.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.615
- Yeah, they are.
You're right.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.443
Yeah, they are.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.402
- How are you and Austen?
Have you talked today?

14:41.445 --> 14:42.751
Is it awkward?

14:42.794 --> 14:44.492
- Um, honestly, no,
it's not awkward.

14:44.535 --> 14:46.320
- I'm ready to
see my room.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.451
- I need to be downloaded.

14:47.495 --> 14:50.498
- So, we, like,
make out and then...

14:53.066 --> 14:54.719
- So, now you guys are
getting married in Italy.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.156
- Well, of course.
- Of course.

14:56.199 --> 14:59.072
I can't wait to live
vicariously through you guys.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.509
Hold on. Ring off.
Now, I'm single.

15:01.552 --> 15:04.033
I just wanna, like,
have fun with my girls.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.253
- All right, I'm gonna go
put some clothes on.

15:06.296 --> 15:09.952
- I'm gonna also change.
- Yeah, come with me.

15:11.432 --> 15:12.346
Me, too.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.260
I'm excited that
you're going.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.001
- As I take my top off.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.698
- My kind of ----ing girl.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.570
Vacation starts now.

15:19.614 --> 15:20.745
What did I miss?

15:20.789 --> 15:22.617
- Well, I've been
apparently missing a lot

15:22.660 --> 15:24.184
every time
I go to sleep.

15:24.227 --> 15:25.489
- Why do you
go to sleep so early?

15:25.533 --> 15:26.751
Do you have a boyfriend?

15:26.795 --> 15:28.449
- Yeah, I have a boyfriend.
- Oh, you do.

15:28.492 --> 15:30.190
- When Paige invited me
on this trip,

15:30.233 --> 15:32.714
my boyfriend and I
were in a very rocky place.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.368
We got back together,

15:34.411 --> 15:37.110
but girls in relationships
can still have fun.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.634
I'm here to get ----ed up,
hold your hair back,

15:39.677 --> 15:41.288
and be your hype girl.

15:41.331 --> 15:44.508
Imagine he wasn't real,
and I just made this all up.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.293
I feel like we're already
best friends,

15:46.336 --> 15:48.077
and you should
just know everything,

15:48.121 --> 15:50.384
and I've heard so much about you
through Austen.

15:50.427 --> 15:51.646
- Well...

15:51.689 --> 15:53.082
- You guys seem like
you have that, like--

15:53.126 --> 15:54.388
- Bond.

15:54.431 --> 15:55.998
- I mean, you guys were,
like, hugging it out.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.653
- Like, no one really knows,
like, the history between us.

15:58.696 --> 16:00.655
- I need to be caught up
because I have no idea.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.570
- So, basically, like,
three years ago,

16:02.613 --> 16:04.659
we meet in the Hamptons,
make out.

16:04.702 --> 16:07.009
Then, like, two years ago,
he comes to New York

16:07.053 --> 16:08.358
New Year's Eve.

16:08.402 --> 16:09.838
We basically hung out
for four days straight.

16:09.881 --> 16:12.145
We both kind of, like,
talked each other

16:12.188 --> 16:15.496
through our relationships and,
like, call each other crying

16:15.539 --> 16:17.150
and, like, call each other
when we're drunk.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.803
- So, you, like, have
an emotional relationship.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.154
- Oh, my God, and then,
on New Year's Eve this year,

16:21.197 --> 16:24.461
we probably Facetimed
15 different times.

16:24.505 --> 16:27.029
I was like,
"What are your goals?"

16:27.073 --> 16:28.422
I was shocked.

16:28.465 --> 16:32.295
He goes, "Lindsay,
I'm gonna date you this year."

16:32.339 --> 16:34.123
What?

16:34.167 --> 16:36.169
- He's set the tone
for the rest of you guys

16:36.212 --> 16:37.518
in this house.
- He's like-- he's--

16:37.561 --> 16:38.867
- You're gonna be in this house
for a while.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.260
- Should we go check
on our girls

16:40.303 --> 16:42.131
and just tell them that
they look so pretty?

16:42.175 --> 16:43.567
- I just need to have
a ----ing conversation with him.

16:43.611 --> 16:44.525
- Yeah, for sure.

16:44.568 --> 16:47.702
- And be like,
what's goin' on?

16:47.745 --> 16:50.444
♪ What's my favorite word
always ♪

16:50.487 --> 16:51.706
- All right.

16:51.749 --> 16:52.533
I'm gonna throw a hoodie on
and my jacket,

16:52.576 --> 16:53.882
and I am ready.

16:53.925 --> 16:54.839
- Should I put a hat on,
or am I okay with this?

16:54.883 --> 16:56.406
- Yeah.
Yeah, for your ears?

16:56.450 --> 16:57.668
Yeah, you're fine.
- I'm okay then.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.714
♪ I'm gonna get mine always

16:59.757 --> 17:00.497
- Hello.
- Yeah.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.290
- You ready to go, though?

17:10.333 --> 17:12.553
- I just wanna
make out so bad.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.598
- Well, be cuter about it.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.165
- Oh!

17:16.209 --> 17:17.732
Oh, my God,
this is so crazy.

17:17.775 --> 17:20.213
- Oh, my gosh, no.
Come out of my closet.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.170
No.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.302
- Damn it.

17:22.345 --> 17:23.564
I thought that
was gonna work.

17:23.607 --> 17:26.828
- Ladies first
and then the boys.

17:26.871 --> 17:29.091
- Tubing is gonna be
----ing awesome.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.267
♪ Yeah you know
life is what you make it ♪

17:31.311 --> 17:32.660
♪ I'll make mine

17:32.703 --> 17:35.184
Yay! We're here.
- Yay! We're here.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.143
- And, Ciara,
thank you for driving us.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.753
- All right.
- This is wild.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.537
- This is gonna be awesome.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.931
- Oh, my God!
- I'm so psyched.

17:42.974 --> 17:45.107
- They're basically sleds
with tubes on 'em.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.717
- We're gonna ----in' fly.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.243
- Oh, she's cheating!

17:50.286 --> 17:52.593
- Oh, you!

17:52.636 --> 17:54.812
- Oh, boy,
I'm goin' ass backwards.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.162
- And they're off!

17:56.205 --> 17:58.294
- Oh, my God!

17:58.338 --> 17:59.687
- I was raised in
Rochester, New York,

17:59.730 --> 18:01.950
so I'm a night tubing
aficionado.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.343
Whoo-hoo!

18:03.386 --> 18:05.127
Growing up,
we would just build ramps,

18:05.171 --> 18:07.434
and hills, and jumps.
Ahh!

18:07.477 --> 18:09.305
So, I think we're gonna
have to turn it up a notch

18:09.349 --> 18:10.654
and make it a little
more competitive.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.482
Oh, sh--.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.661
- You mean
you wanna lose to me.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.186
If I win, you have to
make me homemade pizza.

18:20.229 --> 18:24.277
- Okay.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.495
- I won.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.978
- Oh, my God,
who do you think I am?

18:30.021 --> 18:31.980
- No! No!
I don't like it.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.808
Oh, sh--.
Oh, sh--.

18:34.809 --> 18:35.897
- Kyle!
- What?

18:35.940 --> 18:37.942
- Wait for me.
- Yeah, I am.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.423
- No, you don't
wait for me.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.946
- I'm right here, babe.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.905
- Austen is not even
----ing thinking about me.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.603
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

18:48.736 --> 18:49.693
- All right,
let's rock and roll.

18:49.737 --> 18:50.607
- Let's go.

18:50.651 --> 18:51.869
- We're going to the bar.

18:51.913 --> 18:54.655
- Hittin' the bar!

18:54.698 --> 18:56.613
- Oh, man,
let's start a tab.

18:56.657 --> 18:59.312
- Alrighty.
Thank you.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.835
I appreciate you.
- It's hot, right?

19:00.878 --> 19:01.879
- Take it off.

19:01.923 --> 19:02.750
I like the color,
though, on you.

19:02.793 --> 19:05.013
- Thank you.
I feel that.

19:05.056 --> 19:07.494
That's coyote.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.496
Is this good?
- Try it.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.672
- Do you mind if I sip it?
- Yeah, try it.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.282
- Wow, okay.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.675
- Okay, so,
I have a question.

19:14.718 --> 19:15.806
- Shoot.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.678
- Gabby, like,
are you gonna pursue it?

19:17.721 --> 19:19.114
Like...

19:19.158 --> 19:20.376
- There is certainly a vibe,
and it's gonna, I think,

19:20.420 --> 19:22.335
continue for,
like, two more weeks.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.511
- I know.
You're the entire package

19:24.554 --> 19:28.819
and probably the greatest person
she can pick in this house.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.517
- How do I look?
- You look great.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.561
There you go.
- Thank you.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.825
- You just keep talking me up.
Oh, my goodness.

19:34.869 --> 19:35.913
- I am.
You're my--

19:35.957 --> 19:37.045
- I love this.
You are lookin' out.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.133
You're lookin' out.

19:38.177 --> 19:38.873
- There is a reason
we're friends.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.575
- Craig, your nipples
are fun sized, dude.

19:45.619 --> 19:46.924
- They are.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.362
- Yes, they're
like candy bars.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.015
- It's not the best shape
I've ever been in my life.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.454
It's been a weird time.
- No, you are beautiful.

19:54.497 --> 19:57.326
- Just imagine
if I was in shape.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.807
- What's up, girl?
How we doin'?

19:59.850 --> 20:02.026
- Good. How are you?
- I'm good.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.333
- Yeah.

20:04.377 --> 20:06.901
Austen is givin' me the eyes.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.729
- Can I ask you
'cause, like,

20:08.772 --> 20:10.034
you guys have obviously kissed,

20:10.078 --> 20:12.515
and I know
you've shared a bed or two,

20:12.559 --> 20:15.823
but I'm wondering if
there's any underlying feelings,

20:15.866 --> 20:19.914
or is just, like, a--
a fun friendship or what?

20:24.135 --> 20:25.485
Should we have him
join the convo?

20:25.528 --> 20:29.402
- Yeah. Austen!

20:29.445 --> 20:30.925
- Hey, guys.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.796
- I've never been able to
get it out of either one of you.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.842
- I figured we would
do this together.

20:34.885 --> 20:37.758
- Let's tell him.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.716
Okay, no,
we do have history.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.762
- See, these are the details
that I'm actually interested in.

20:41.805 --> 20:45.069
- I'm just trying to know what--
- Let's just get it out.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.507
- The way that
the story goes...

20:47.550 --> 20:49.639
- Ultimately...

20:49.683 --> 20:51.815
- We ----ed.
- We ----ed.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.739
- The way that
the story goes...

21:02.783 --> 21:03.871
- Ultimately...

21:04.872 --> 21:07.570
- We ----ed.
- We ----ed.

21:07.614 --> 21:08.963
- I'm glad we're using words

21:09.006 --> 21:10.878
that I can actually
understand now.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.752
- Oh, my God,
this literally happened

21:15.796 --> 21:18.451
so ----in' long ago,
and we have kept this

21:18.494 --> 21:20.714
to ourselves for so long.
- No one knows.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.716
- One time during one of
the many breaks

21:22.759 --> 21:25.109
that me and my ex
used to go on,

21:25.153 --> 21:27.590
Lindsay and I
did sleep together.

21:27.634 --> 21:30.201
Craig didn't even know.
I love Lindsay,

21:30.245 --> 21:32.639
but I also have this thing
for Ciara

21:32.682 --> 21:34.031
just because I have fun.

21:34.075 --> 21:35.990
I don't want her
to run for the hills.

21:36.033 --> 21:40.777
Sh--, I am so over
the love triangle.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.039
There's no winning.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.519
- I'm gonna let you guys
figure this one out.

21:49.438 --> 21:50.439
- Wow.

21:50.483 --> 21:51.571
- I've never been
turned on more.

21:51.614 --> 21:53.007
What did you say?

21:53.050 --> 21:54.400
- I said, "Paige, you have
such a beautiful smile,

21:54.443 --> 21:56.227
but you should
use it more."

21:56.271 --> 21:58.447
- Thank you for my fries.
I'm appreciative of this.

21:58.491 --> 21:59.927
- It's okay, just enough
for a few people.

21:59.970 --> 22:00.928
- Just us.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.191
- Cheers.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.192
- Now, we're here.

22:04.235 --> 22:05.933
We have two weeks
together now.

22:05.976 --> 22:09.893
Linds, is-is, like,
there any world that, like,

22:09.937 --> 22:11.112
you and I can just say
everyone

22:11.155 --> 22:14.028
and just be-be together?

22:14.071 --> 22:16.204
- Like, do I think
about, like, you

22:16.247 --> 22:19.163
and a potential future?
- Yeah.

22:19.207 --> 22:20.556
- Yeah, I do.
- You have?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.079
- Yes.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.176
- It's the longest hug
I've ever seen.

22:35.745 --> 22:36.616
- I miss you.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.272
- No, I think he's
probably sweating.

22:41.316 --> 22:43.100
That was
a really long hug.

22:43.144 --> 22:44.580
- I knew they were close,

22:44.624 --> 22:46.234
but since she walked
into this house,

22:46.277 --> 22:49.455
she has literally been trying
to take all of his attention.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.110
- I love you.

22:53.154 --> 22:54.982
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.505
- Are we ready to go?

22:58.812 --> 23:00.466
- All right. All right,
all right, all right.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.952
Let's go back
to the house.

23:08.996 --> 23:11.781
♪ Let's go top notch
in the top spot ♪

23:11.825 --> 23:15.176
♪ with a new watch
and you can just watch ♪

23:15.219 --> 23:17.526
- It's kind of slippery.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.136
- Dude, my lips are
chapped as

23:19.180 --> 23:21.095
Oh, Jesus,
that's slippery.

23:21.138 --> 23:23.532
- Oh, hello.
- Hi!

23:25.621 --> 23:27.144
Time for a shot?
- Give me a second.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.021
- What are you doing
in here by yourself?

23:37.372 --> 23:39.069
- Yeah, we'll get it.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.158
Okay, I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me.

23:41.202 --> 23:42.595
- Okay.
- Or if you're just
looking for me,

23:42.638 --> 23:44.553
'cause you miss me so much.

23:44.597 --> 23:47.077
- I'll probably be
there right away.

23:47.121 --> 23:48.992
- Dude, what the
is going on?

23:49.036 --> 23:51.299
Are you just making
a mushroom pasta at 10:45?

23:51.342 --> 23:54.302
- Yeah. You don't want it?
- I'm gonna cry.

23:58.219 --> 23:59.786
- Here we are.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.834
Just what
the doctor ordered.

24:06.401 --> 24:08.229
- Hello?

24:08.272 --> 24:10.666
- Are you okay?

24:10.710 --> 24:14.931
- You gonna come
lay with me and be cute?

24:14.975 --> 24:16.759
- Hey.
- Yeah, baby.

24:16.803 --> 24:19.109
- Hi!
- Hi.

24:19.153 --> 24:22.852
Um, I am going
to change and...

24:22.896 --> 24:26.856
- Tell me about it, stud.

24:26.900 --> 24:30.338
What the [BLEEP], Lin?

24:30.381 --> 24:32.122
- Is she annoyed?

24:32.166 --> 24:33.472
- Why did she
wanna tell me that?

24:33.515 --> 24:34.690
- I think she wanted to
tell you something else,

24:34.734 --> 24:36.736
but then I was in here.
- Probably.

24:39.042 --> 24:41.218
- Get your girl.
Get your girl.

24:41.262 --> 24:43.133
- What?
- Don't worry.

24:43.177 --> 24:44.874
- Are we good?
- Yeah, we're good.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.223
- Dude, you came in hot.

24:48.399 --> 24:51.968
- I-I-- Oh!

24:52.012 --> 24:54.623
- Oh!
- Ow.

24:54.667 --> 24:55.624
- Are you okay?
- All right. Okay.

24:55.668 --> 24:58.018
- That was--
that was a lot.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.063
- This is my new roomie.

25:04.111 --> 25:05.808
- Come here, Hubhouse.

25:05.852 --> 25:08.245
- There you go.
- Hi!

25:08.289 --> 25:09.725
- Welcome back to
Craig and the crew.

25:09.769 --> 25:12.902
- So, I'm here live
with my great friend, Luke.

25:12.946 --> 25:15.383
- Austen!
- Lins!

25:15.426 --> 25:17.733
- Okay, what's up?
- He is the father.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.082
- Ha-ha!

25:19.126 --> 25:23.173
- Somebody help us!
- Lins, where are you?

25:23.217 --> 25:25.132
- In my room, Austen!

25:26.960 --> 25:28.048
- Okay.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.484
- I didn't even taste it.
Is it okay?

25:29.528 --> 25:30.703
- I'm sure of it. Thank you.
- Oh, I'm sure it is.

25:30.746 --> 25:31.921
I just put some ground
pepper on there.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.357
- I'm happy. Yep.

25:33.401 --> 25:34.794
- I mean, like, she just
walked into his room,

25:34.837 --> 25:36.447
saw me in there,
like, rolled her eyes,

25:36.491 --> 25:38.145
and then leaves.

25:38.188 --> 25:40.408
- So, they hooked up,
like, three years ago,

25:40.451 --> 25:44.151
and then she's always
just had a thing for him.

25:44.194 --> 25:45.761
- Oh, my God.

25:45.805 --> 25:48.198
- I think,
in the last two years,

25:48.242 --> 25:50.287
anyone that she's dated
she would have left

25:50.331 --> 25:53.813
in a heartbeat
for Austen.

25:53.856 --> 25:56.990
- Okay, guys, I did not think
that this was gonna be what

25:57.033 --> 25:59.688
was happening when you
called Austen down here.

25:59.732 --> 26:00.994
- I didn't either.

26:01.037 --> 26:01.690
- I'm not really interested
in watching this.

26:01.734 --> 26:02.343
- What is happening?

26:02.386 --> 26:04.954
Lins, off now.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.826
Off.

26:06.869 --> 26:09.306
- Uh, what is goin' on?

26:09.350 --> 26:11.352
Did you guys just
have a conversation?

26:11.395 --> 26:12.658
- I love you.

26:12.701 --> 26:13.876
- There is a family love,
and there is, like,

26:13.920 --> 26:15.443
a I wanna
you love.

26:15.486 --> 26:17.793
- Are you in love with me?
- I don't know.

26:17.837 --> 26:21.710
- I just love you. I do.

26:21.754 --> 26:25.888
- Well, I am more confused
than I was before.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.803
- I didn't know that you
didn't know that Lindsay

26:27.847 --> 26:29.849
has always had
a crush on him,

26:29.892 --> 26:31.328
but I don't think
that should matter.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.243
- Well, I didn't know
that it was still, like,

26:33.287 --> 26:34.897
a current thing.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.812
- How do you feel?
- Austen...

26:43.863 --> 26:45.299
I'm in love with you.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.697
I'm in love with you.

26:53.524 --> 26:54.961
I don't think
you understand.

26:55.004 --> 26:55.918
- I-I--

26:57.746 --> 26:59.922
- No.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.316
No.

27:07.451 --> 27:08.757
- No.

27:08.801 --> 27:09.540
- Are you just saying this
'cause, like,

27:09.584 --> 27:09.932
you're drunk right now?

27:09.976 --> 27:11.891
- No.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.457
I'm in love with you.

27:21.378 --> 27:23.119
Go do your thing.

27:23.163 --> 27:25.426
I just wanted you to know.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.384
- Okay.

27:27.428 --> 27:28.821
- It's up to you.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.043
- Okay.

27:34.087 --> 27:36.306
Lindsay of all people
should know

27:36.350 --> 27:38.221
that I can't hear
someone tell me right now

27:38.265 --> 27:39.483
that they're
in love with me.

27:39.527 --> 27:42.878
Like, she knows the trauma,
the deception,

27:42.922 --> 27:45.359
the unhealthiness
of my Madison bullsh--.

27:45.402 --> 27:46.969
- He wasn't the only one
she was hooking up with.

27:47.013 --> 27:48.144
She dates multiple
different people.

27:48.188 --> 27:49.624
- That is a lie!
- She's horrible.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.104
- What do you care?

27:51.147 --> 27:52.366
- Yes. He's just mad that
his girlfriend is a slut.

27:52.409 --> 27:53.846
- Because he's in my
friend's life, and I--

27:53.889 --> 27:55.108
- That's his problem.
- Okay, but they're broken up.

27:55.151 --> 27:56.283
- Well, they actually aren't.
- No. Andy, Andy--

27:56.326 --> 27:57.893
- That would be a huge
difference, Andy.

27:57.937 --> 27:58.764
- She's still ----ing with me
as hard as she possibly can.

27:58.807 --> 27:59.503
- They just slept together.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.464
- Nothing.

28:03.507 --> 28:06.946
Nothing. I'm gonna
go to my room and process.

28:06.989 --> 28:08.338
- Just pose for me.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.949
No, it looks good
with the dribble.

28:10.993 --> 28:13.517
Like this. What?
It's so good.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.565
Perfect.

28:18.653 --> 28:21.525
- Is that cooler or this?

28:41.371 --> 28:43.330
- No.
- It's only three products.

28:43.373 --> 28:45.549
- Three?

28:45.593 --> 28:47.421
- Is that
a little or a lot?

28:47.464 --> 28:50.119
- Uh, it's a lot,
I think.

28:50.163 --> 28:51.642
- We're gonna live
our best life.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.209
- We are all just
living our best life.
- Best life.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.215
Here's some mistletoe.

28:59.259 --> 29:01.000
- Wait, wait.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.611
Okay. I just--
- Okay.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.004
Muah.
- Ahh.

29:10.531 --> 29:13.012
- Austen?
- Hmm?

29:13.055 --> 29:15.710
- You're so cute but come on.
Let's go to your bed.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.494
Come on.

29:17.538 --> 29:18.626
- Okay, I will.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.541
Okay, I gotta
go downstairs.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.544
- I'm excited
to go to bed.

29:23.587 --> 29:24.632
- If you guys wanna
play a drinking game...

29:24.675 --> 29:25.938
- Yeah.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.383
- Boom.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.254
- Are you kidding?

29:38.298 --> 29:39.908
- Come on, Craig.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.910
- Oh, the secret weapon.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.303
Call me!

29:44.652 --> 29:46.045
- ----in' bullsh--.

29:46.088 --> 29:48.569
- this game.
I'm outta here, man.

29:50.571 --> 29:52.399
Sorry, no fire
in here, my dear.

30:04.063 --> 30:06.674
- My girlfriend uses
the wax ones because I snore.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.502
That's what we had
in exams in law school.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.352
- I was thinkin' I might make
a Spanish omelet this morning.

30:32.395 --> 30:33.657
Is anyone else up?

30:33.701 --> 30:34.789
- Dude, I was thinking
about an omelet, too.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.138
That sounds bomb.
- I'll do that.

30:44.712 --> 30:47.193
- Some people look at a recipe
and follow it to a T.

30:47.236 --> 30:48.585
I can look at a recipe
and be like, well,

30:48.629 --> 30:50.152
I can make it better.

30:50.196 --> 30:51.110
- What do you need?
Tomatoes?

30:51.153 --> 30:53.982
- Garlic.
- Can you catch?

30:54.026 --> 30:55.549
- Whoa.

30:55.592 --> 30:58.421
I do love cooking for people,
especially gorgeous women.

30:58.465 --> 30:59.466
How'd you sleep?

30:59.509 --> 31:00.815
- I had, like,
a weird nightmare.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.295
- You're puttin'
your heart on a plate.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.079
It puts off
a vibe of its own.

31:04.123 --> 31:05.646
- I try to blink
my eyes in my sleep,

31:05.689 --> 31:07.387
and then it clicks
to a different dream.

31:07.430 --> 31:08.649
- Oh, my goodness.

31:13.045 --> 31:14.133
- You got pretty
----ed up.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.525
- I know, but I feel
fine, actually,

31:15.569 --> 31:17.310
and I'm kind of excited
to get outside.

31:17.353 --> 31:18.441
It's, like, fresh snow.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.052
- I might make an igloo.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.488
- If anybody can
do it, it's you.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.882
- What's up?
- Yo.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.710
- You got a busy morning?
- There's a lotta things.

31:26.754 --> 31:28.321
- Have you talked
to Lindsay?

31:28.364 --> 31:29.757
Like, what the hell is
goin' on with that?

31:29.800 --> 31:31.759
- She said,
"I'm in love with you."

31:31.802 --> 31:33.630
- Yeah, which is what
I told you before.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.154
- I know.
I hate when you're right.

31:35.197 --> 31:37.025
You're like an idiot
----in' savant.

31:38.505 --> 31:41.551
Like, I don't want that
to, like, frighten off...

31:41.595 --> 31:43.249
- Ciara.

31:43.292 --> 31:45.816
- Dude...

31:45.860 --> 31:48.558
I ----ing, like,
kinda wanna know, like,

31:48.602 --> 31:51.518
what Lindsay and Austen
were talking about.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.041
I can, like, feel myself
putting up a wall

31:53.085 --> 31:54.608
with this situation.
- Right.

31:54.651 --> 31:55.652
- If you guys need to,
like, still figure out

31:55.696 --> 31:57.176
your sh--, then, like,

31:57.219 --> 31:59.134
that's what you need to do.
- Right.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.486
- Coming up...

32:03.530 --> 32:05.749
- Gabby-- is that something
that you're into?

32:05.793 --> 32:07.708
- I didn't know if she was,
like, talking to Luke.

32:07.751 --> 32:09.362
- Oh, he's shaping
it right now.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.494
Building the foundation.

32:11.538 --> 32:13.583
- Your man is building
you a home for you guys.

32:13.627 --> 32:15.237
- I literally would be
barefoot in the woods

32:15.281 --> 32:16.804
if I ever date him.

32:20.242 --> 32:21.940
- You did a damn
good job, Jason.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.116
- Thanks, Luke. It means
a lot coming from you.

32:24.159 --> 32:25.726
- It's ----ing unreal, man.

32:27.510 --> 32:28.947
- I just, like,
I can't get comfortable.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.165
I can't get
the right temperature

32:30.209 --> 32:31.427
because of the air.

32:34.604 --> 32:35.649
- Amanda hates me.

32:35.692 --> 32:37.390
Then I was, like,
too hot, too cold,

32:37.433 --> 32:38.826
too hot, too cold.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.871
I don't sleep well,
and this is, without a doubt,

32:40.915 --> 32:43.439
the worst sleeping arrangement
I have been in.

32:43.483 --> 32:44.875
- Kyle?

32:44.919 --> 32:46.747
- In a vacation house.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.880
- You feel asleep in
the ----ing pantry.

32:53.188 --> 32:54.407
- Amanda is like,
"Can you stop moving in bed?"

32:54.450 --> 32:56.583
I'm like...

32:57.714 --> 33:00.630
yeah, but, like,
mattress sucks, dude.

33:00.674 --> 33:02.502
- I just, like, literally
can't listen to you

33:02.545 --> 33:04.678
talk about
the bedroom anymore.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.377
- Yeah?

33:08.421 --> 33:10.292
- Oh, my God.
- Coffee for my ladies.

33:10.336 --> 33:11.902
- Oh, my God.

33:11.946 --> 33:13.861
Wow, you're really
making this a habit.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.819
Wow.
- Oh, my God.

33:18.431 --> 33:19.954
- I put, uh,
the vanilla one

33:19.998 --> 33:21.651
because I remember you guys
like the vanilla.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.218
- You're the best.

33:23.262 --> 33:24.654
- By the way, you guys
wake up perfect.

33:24.698 --> 33:25.829
I'm shocked.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.309
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, thank you.

33:27.353 --> 33:28.397
- See you later.

33:31.444 --> 33:35.448
- My dad brings my mom coffee
every single morning.

33:35.491 --> 33:36.840
So, I'm, like, are you
in love with me?

33:36.884 --> 33:38.538
Just say it.

33:43.586 --> 33:45.327
- Good morning, precious.
- Did you get sleep?

33:45.371 --> 33:46.850
- I got some really
good sleep, actually.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.374
- You look bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

33:48.417 --> 33:49.636
- Do I?
- You do.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.464
- I feel good, seriously.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.858
- Hi.

33:54.902 --> 33:57.209
- Come and sit.
- Did you run up here?

33:57.252 --> 33:58.427
- Did Kyle sleep
from that--

33:58.471 --> 34:02.344
- My ----ing child
is like mah, mah, mah.

34:02.388 --> 34:04.868
- Good morning.

34:04.912 --> 34:07.958
- Oh, everyone.

34:08.002 --> 34:10.309
- Wait, how do you have
a full face already?

34:10.352 --> 34:12.311
- I woke up early.
I was cold.

34:12.354 --> 34:13.877
It's, like, freezing
in our basement.

34:13.921 --> 34:17.403
I take it you guys are not
going fat tire riding?

34:17.446 --> 34:18.882
- I actually don't
even know if I remember

34:18.926 --> 34:20.275
how to ride a bike.

34:20.319 --> 34:21.581
- Who all is going?

34:21.624 --> 34:23.409
- I feel like it's
all the boys minus Andrea.

34:23.452 --> 34:24.671
- Yeah, he wants to hang out
with the girls.

34:24.714 --> 34:25.889
- I think Luke
is not going

34:25.933 --> 34:27.413
because he wants
to build an igloo.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.284
- Wait, how is he
gonna build an igloo?

34:29.328 --> 34:30.633
Like...
- He's Luke.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.374
- It's actually gonna
be sick when it's done.

34:32.418 --> 34:33.375
- All right.
I have to go get ready.

34:33.419 --> 34:35.334
- All right.
- Okay.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.726
- It's just weird.

34:36.770 --> 34:37.901
Like, we wake up.
Everything is normal.

34:37.945 --> 34:39.555
And she's like oh.

34:39.599 --> 34:42.428
Like, were-were you
there last night?

34:42.471 --> 34:44.647
You ever heard
of a girl code?

34:44.691 --> 34:46.345
I mean, me and Austen
were on a roll.

34:50.392 --> 34:52.568
Lindsay is
----ing up my sh--.

34:52.612 --> 34:55.702
I thought we had
the cute vacation romance,

34:55.745 --> 34:57.486
but now I don't know
what's going on.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.967
I'm just, like, bitch,
perfect ----ing timing.

35:11.413 --> 35:12.849
- You should
have a beer-tini.

35:12.893 --> 35:13.763
- Right now?
- Yeah.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.113
- We have olives?
- Yeah.

35:15.156 --> 35:16.592
- Tell me the purpose.
- It's a Midwest thing.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.377
Why the we do it,
I don't know,

35:18.420 --> 35:19.595
and then you get
a snack

35:19.639 --> 35:20.944
at the bottom.
- Love that.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.294
Get a snack at the bottom.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.820
- No.
- You have to.

35:26.863 --> 35:28.300
- I have to.

35:28.343 --> 35:29.823
Should we take
some shots?

35:29.866 --> 35:31.738
- Absolutely.

35:31.781 --> 35:33.392
- Wow.

35:33.435 --> 35:34.393
Oh, we're in the first one.

35:34.436 --> 35:35.655
- Come on, peeps.
- Adios!

35:35.698 --> 35:36.873
- Are we out?

35:38.484 --> 35:39.963
- We're goin' out.
We're gettin' somethin' done.

35:40.007 --> 35:41.574
We're doin'
somethin' active.

35:42.792 --> 35:44.142
- Bye.

35:44.185 --> 35:46.492
I'm happy to stay home
right now for two reasons.

35:46.535 --> 35:48.102
One, I don't
wanna go biking.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.931
Two, I don't wanna listen
to Kyle complain anymore.

35:50.974 --> 35:53.716
If he wants to
fat tire bike to Canada,

35:53.760 --> 35:55.457
I don't even care.

35:55.501 --> 35:57.720
- Looks like Luke is
building us an igloo.

35:57.764 --> 35:59.418
- This is gonna take
for ----in' ever.

36:01.985 --> 36:03.465
- Wrap up
and get ready, y'all.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.470
- It's so beautiful.

36:08.514 --> 36:09.645
- Here we go!

36:09.689 --> 36:11.473
- I'm popping
wheelies, bro.

36:11.517 --> 36:12.735
- I will bumper car you.

36:12.779 --> 36:13.997
- After.

36:14.041 --> 36:14.998
- It's so pretty.

36:15.042 --> 36:17.131
- Oh, boy!

36:17.175 --> 36:19.089
- Ahh!

36:19.133 --> 36:21.353
- Oh, no, I'm off
the course.

36:21.396 --> 36:23.181
- Oh, Jules is down!
Jules is down!

36:23.224 --> 36:24.486
- This ain't big enough
for the both of us.

36:26.140 --> 36:27.750
Guys, I completely ate it.

36:29.404 --> 36:30.536
- I wish we can hear him.

36:30.579 --> 36:31.711
What do you think
he's saying?

36:31.754 --> 36:32.886
- What the [BLEEP]?
-

36:34.714 --> 36:36.019
- [BLEEP]!

36:36.063 --> 36:37.456
- ----in' A.

36:37.499 --> 36:38.500
- Mother----er.

36:38.544 --> 36:39.936
- Oh, he's shaping it
right now,

36:39.980 --> 36:42.025
building the foundation.

36:42.069 --> 36:44.550
- Your man is building you
a home for you guys.

36:44.593 --> 36:46.856
- I would totally
go to the Arctics

36:46.900 --> 36:49.032
with Luke and live
in an igloo.

36:49.076 --> 36:51.861
All I know, is I would
never go hungry,

36:51.905 --> 36:53.080
and I would just have
to learn how to sew

36:53.123 --> 36:54.734
to make him clothes.

36:54.777 --> 36:56.214
I literally would be
barefoot in the woods

36:56.257 --> 36:58.085
if I ever date him.

36:59.826 --> 37:01.567
- Can you take a photo
of me on the bridge, Kyle?

37:01.610 --> 37:03.482
- I'll take a photo
of you on the bridge.

37:03.525 --> 37:06.180
Look how picturesque
this is.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.008
We'll make Amanda jealous.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.184
- Aww, don't make
Amanda jealous.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.577
- All right, we're doin'
a family snow angel.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.970
Come on.
- Three, two, one.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.015
- I'm gonna land
on that tree stump.

37:15.058 --> 37:16.059
- it.
- Ahh!

37:18.018 --> 37:19.846
- I am hurt.
- Oh, yes.

37:19.889 --> 37:22.240
- You gotta eat some snow.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.633
- Looks like I'm, like,
walking with a helmet on.

37:24.677 --> 37:25.765
- That's what I
should be doing.

37:26.940 --> 37:27.810
- All right, stay there.

37:29.899 --> 37:31.510
- They should have--
they should have come.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.731
- Gabby-- is that something
that you're into?

37:35.775 --> 37:37.603
- I feel like I know
Gabby so well.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.082
Make it a point to, like,

37:39.126 --> 37:40.736
put in some alone time
with her.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.042
- I'm definitely gonna
have to pull her aside.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.086
- Yeah, yeah.
When we get back to the house,

37:43.130 --> 37:44.958
that's what you should do.

37:46.655 --> 37:47.874
- Really, 'cause you
are doing so well

37:47.917 --> 37:49.310
with the friend zone.

37:49.354 --> 37:51.878
- I didn't know if she was,
like, talking to Luke.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.579
- Oh, it's going.

37:57.623 --> 37:58.624
- Yeah,

37:58.667 --> 37:59.929
it takes
a lot of ----in' work.

37:59.973 --> 38:01.975
- Well, I am
so impressed with you.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.505
- I should have
made a fire.

38:10.549 --> 38:11.898
- That's really cute.

38:16.642 --> 38:17.730
- I don't know
if Gabby is into me.

38:17.773 --> 38:18.948
I'm oblivious to a lot.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.602
I'm-- like, a girl could
probably be naked,

38:20.646 --> 38:22.082
throwing herself
in front of me,

38:22.125 --> 38:23.605
and I still wouldn't know
that she's coming on to me.

38:23.649 --> 38:25.128
- So, right now, you're
just creating a dome.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.305
- Yeah.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.002
- Wow.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.135
- Coming up...

38:32.179 --> 38:35.617
- Lins, I love you...

38:35.661 --> 38:37.576
like a sister.

38:41.797 --> 38:43.146
- We're getting
a ski lesson.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.234
- Should we come down?

38:44.278 --> 38:45.235
- Yeah.

38:45.279 --> 38:46.846
- Where are we
going skiing?

38:46.889 --> 38:48.021
- I know.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.724
- Wait. What?

38:55.768 --> 38:56.856
- Oh, you're teaching me
how to get up.

38:56.899 --> 38:57.813
- Yeah.

38:59.119 --> 39:01.164
- I need ski lessons,
but I feel like Andrea

39:01.208 --> 39:02.688
doesn't know
much more than I do.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.603
So, I'm gonna wait.

39:04.646 --> 39:05.691
- Sorry, I don't wanna
touch your butt.

39:05.734 --> 39:07.693
- You can touch it.

39:07.736 --> 39:09.347
- I started skiing
when I was five years old.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.958
[indistinct], I used
to compete, too, as well.

39:12.001 --> 39:15.048
I have a couple of caps in
my bedroom that I'm proud of.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.310
I haven't skied
in ten years,

39:16.354 --> 39:18.094
but I can take care
of the ladies.

39:18.138 --> 39:20.401
- Oh, that's actually
really hard.

39:20.445 --> 39:21.707
- Sorry, I didn't mean
to touch your butt,

39:21.750 --> 39:22.882
but it was a way
to help you.

39:22.925 --> 39:24.797
- Yeah, no, it's
all professional

39:24.840 --> 39:25.885
'cause you're
my ski instructor.

39:25.928 --> 39:27.277
- Exactly.
- Right.

39:27.321 --> 39:29.715
- So, we're gonna bend
your knees slightly

39:29.758 --> 39:32.021
and put your butt down

39:32.065 --> 39:33.240
but...
- Okay, like we're sitting.

39:33.283 --> 39:34.676
- Yeah, like
you're sitting.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.417
- So, if you wanna turn,
you just move your knees?

39:36.461 --> 39:37.766
- No, you move...

39:39.986 --> 39:41.944
- Bux-- buxom?
- I didn't say--

39:41.988 --> 39:43.685
- Your butt?
- Gluteus maximus.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.426
- Your butt.
We say bachino.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.732
- Bachino.
- Bachino.

39:46.775 --> 39:47.994
- Oh, it's so much cuter
in Italian.

39:48.037 --> 39:49.430
- It's cuter.
- So, you move your bachino.

39:49.474 --> 39:52.041
- Hold my skis,
and I wanna turn.

39:52.085 --> 39:53.913
Look how good I am.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.131
- Oh.

39:55.175 --> 39:56.655
- She knows how
to move her hips.

39:56.698 --> 39:57.960
- Would you like a drink?
- Yeah, I would.

39:59.527 --> 40:02.008
- How are you vibing with,
like, the girls in the house?

40:02.051 --> 40:04.053
- I feel like I've-I've
been getting on with

40:04.097 --> 40:05.794
everybody really well.
- Yeah.

40:05.838 --> 40:07.970
- I totally am
tapped out like this.

40:08.014 --> 40:09.232
- No, no, no.

40:09.276 --> 40:10.277
- Like, is she your type?

40:10.320 --> 40:11.713
- Gabby?
- Yeah.

40:11.757 --> 40:13.628
- Yeah, she's very pretty,
but I just don't see it

40:13.672 --> 40:14.847
more than that.

40:14.890 --> 40:16.805
- Would you and Lindsay
ever hook up?

40:16.849 --> 40:18.894
- I-- no, Lindsay
is like my sister.

40:18.938 --> 40:20.069
Like, I can't.

40:20.113 --> 40:21.331
What the

40:21.375 --> 40:22.942
- Not like your sister.

40:22.985 --> 40:26.075
- Well, when you cross
that-that bridge of

40:26.119 --> 40:28.730
penis in vagina, it gets
a little bit more difficult

40:28.774 --> 40:29.949
and--
- I think it's a tunnel.

40:29.992 --> 40:31.080
- Yeah.

40:31.124 --> 40:32.299
- It's not a bridge.

40:35.737 --> 40:37.870
- I think they got
a spot around back.

40:37.913 --> 40:40.786
- Oh, we'll stop right here.
- Oh, yes.

40:40.829 --> 40:43.963
- This is, like, Luke's
wet dream, right here.

40:44.006 --> 40:45.268
- Okay.

40:45.312 --> 40:46.835
- Hi.
Welcome in, everybody.

40:46.879 --> 40:48.228
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- How are you all today?

40:48.271 --> 40:49.359
How was the ride?

40:49.403 --> 40:50.665
- It was good.

40:50.709 --> 40:52.014
- Do you wanna
start us off?

40:52.058 --> 40:53.755
- I'm gonna do
a roadie salad.

40:53.799 --> 40:56.149
- May I please have
the ranch camp cob?

40:56.192 --> 40:57.455
- Sure.

40:57.498 --> 41:00.066
- And then can we also
have the sticky balls?

41:00.109 --> 41:01.328
- Right here.

41:01.371 --> 41:02.982
- Extra sticky
on the balls.

41:03.025 --> 41:04.331
- You got it.

41:04.374 --> 41:07.813
- Oh, did you get a little--
did you tie it up?

41:07.856 --> 41:09.467
- He's giving himself
a hairstyle.

41:09.510 --> 41:10.816
- You know, I'm about to eat.
I don't want my hair in my food.

41:12.252 --> 41:13.296
- Are we indulging?

41:13.340 --> 41:14.863
- Yes.

41:14.907 --> 41:16.169
Yes.

41:16.212 --> 41:17.823
- Wow, this is
some good food.

41:17.866 --> 41:19.477
- Mmm.

41:22.828 --> 41:23.785
- Are you gonna
talk to Lindsay?

41:23.829 --> 41:24.960
- Yeah.

41:32.098 --> 41:34.274
Hey, how are you?

41:34.317 --> 41:36.363
- I'm-I'm fine.

41:36.406 --> 41:38.278
- Are you?
- So...

41:38.321 --> 41:39.714
- I'm not.

41:39.758 --> 41:40.846
- Why are you not fine?

41:40.889 --> 41:43.109
- Because you dropped
a bomb on me.

41:43.152 --> 41:46.765
You straight up told me
that you were in love with me,

41:46.808 --> 41:48.288
and I was like,
"I-I love you, too."

41:48.331 --> 41:49.507
And you were
like, "No, no, no.

41:49.550 --> 41:50.856
I don't-I don't
just love you.

41:50.899 --> 41:53.336
I-I'm in love with you."

41:53.380 --> 41:55.817
And I didn't know that.

41:59.038 --> 42:01.736
Lins, I love you...

42:01.780 --> 42:05.523
like a sister.

42:05.566 --> 42:09.352
It just works so much better,
you know, this way.

42:09.396 --> 42:11.224
I don't want this
to be ----ed up

42:11.267 --> 42:13.008
because we are too close.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.319
- Next time,
on "Winter House"...

42:19.362 --> 42:20.755
- Start your engines!

42:23.279 --> 42:25.760
- Whoo!

42:27.893 --> 42:31.026
- Julia doesn't even want
Luke because she has a man.

42:35.074 --> 42:36.466
- Yeah.

42:36.510 --> 42:38.251
- I was thinking we could do
a little double date.

42:38.294 --> 42:40.079
- Her focus is on
career is, like,

42:40.122 --> 42:42.124
the hottest possible thing
you can ever say.

42:42.168 --> 42:43.386
- That's hot.
- Whew.

42:43.430 --> 42:44.562
- On a scale from one to ten,

42:44.605 --> 42:46.781
how is the first date?
- Like, an 11.

42:46.825 --> 42:48.130
- A 12.

42:48.174 --> 42:49.915
- Doesn't this hurt
your neck?

42:49.958 --> 42:51.830
- It's better than the bar.
You're softer.

42:51.873 --> 42:53.440
- My two best friends
are on a double date,

42:53.483 --> 42:55.311
and what are you
asking me to do?

42:55.355 --> 42:56.922
Bench press me.

42:56.965 --> 42:59.141
- I just got two texts
from two girls that I like.

42:59.185 --> 43:01.448
- Wait, you're talking to
two girls at the same time?

43:01.491 --> 43:03.581
- I've only known him to be
sleeping around with girls.
