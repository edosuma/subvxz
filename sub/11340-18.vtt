WEBVTT

00:41.750 --> 00:43.035
You okay?

00:43.040 --> 00:44.826
Yeah. I just need some fresh air.

00:44.830 --> 00:46.878
I'm going to...
I'm gonna run around a little bit.

00:47.540 --> 00:49.451
I'm gonna be as good as new.

00:51.330 --> 00:54.117
Are we home?

00:54.420 --> 00:56.456
Not yet, buddy. Go back to sleep, okay?

01:12.830 --> 01:14.661
What a goofball.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.029
He fainted.

01:34.790 --> 01:35.996
Matt.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.115
Dad!

01:39.580 --> 01:40.956
Ohh! I got you.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.450
My heart is racing.

01:47.420 --> 01:48.569
What is it?

01:48.580 --> 01:50.070
The car just stopped.

01:52.540 --> 01:53.871
Must be the battery.

01:53.880 --> 01:54.995
Stop fooling around.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.570
No, I'm serious. The car will not start.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.877
At least turn the lights on.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.108
Mom's afraid of the dark.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.200
No, I'm not.

02:10.750 --> 02:11.956
I got you.

02:12.210 --> 02:13.245
I got you.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.917
Hi, hi, hi. Sorry
for the cryptic late-night text,

02:24.920 --> 02:26.956
but I promised I'd fill you in
on the way here,

02:26.960 --> 02:28.916
and I am a girl
who keeps her promises.

02:28.920 --> 02:32.572
So, this boy was found two hours ago
in the middle of nowhere.

02:32.580 --> 02:35.071
Technically, he was found
outside of Crawford, Arizona.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.878
My point is, he has clearly been
to super hell

02:37.880 --> 02:39.609
and escaped some sort of captivity.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.531
How do we know he wasn't
Just dropped off there?

02:41.540 --> 02:44.202
Well, he has fresh cuts
on the bottom of his feet

02:44.210 --> 02:45.450
from the local cactus fields,

02:45.460 --> 02:46.950
and that's away
from any through roads,

02:46.960 --> 02:49.531
and his skin is rubbed raw
around his ankles from chains.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.747
He must've had a chance
to escape and he took it.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.661
Or the UnSub
could have had him in transit.

02:53.670 --> 02:55.615
My God,
you guys, look at his eyes.

02:55.620 --> 02:56.780
Yeah, he's jaundiced.

02:56.790 --> 02:58.451
Probably hasn't seen
daylight in a while.

02:58.460 --> 02:59.916
Yeah, and there's a lot of scars here.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.569
And those are the ones we can see.

03:01.580 --> 03:05.072
It's hard to tell for certain,
but he's maybe 13.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.321
Are there any missing
children in the area, Garcia?

03:07.330 --> 03:08.957
None until now, but, sir,

03:08.960 --> 03:10.325
you may have more information
than I do.

03:10.330 --> 03:13.743
I do. Earlier tonight another boy
was reported missing in Flagstaff.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.991
That's not that far.
It can't be a coincidence.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.160
Technically, it could,

03:17.170 --> 03:19.070
but Arizona has the lowest
abduction rate in the country,

03:19.080 --> 03:22.379
so_the chances of these cases _
not being related are ridiculously slim.

03:22.380 --> 03:23.995
Yeah. That's why
Child Abduction Rapid Deployment

03:24.000 --> 03:25.115
will meet you on the ground.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.827
The Flagstaff abduction
is Billy Henderson, 13.

03:27.830 --> 03:30.321
His parents say he was coming back
from a friend's house after dinner.

03:30.330 --> 03:31.456
He never made it.

03:31.460 --> 03:32.575
Okay, they set up roadblocks,

03:32.580 --> 03:33.786
but the UnSub has a head start.

03:33.790 --> 03:35.997
Right now our best chance
of finding Billy Henderson

03:36.000 --> 03:37.877
is to figure out
what the first victim knows.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.166
Exactly. 50, Morgan,
you and JJ go to the hospital,

03:40.170 --> 03:41.614
see if you can get through to him.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.167
The rest of us will set up
at the police station.

03:43.710 --> 03:45.826
Losing his victim has likely
enraged the UnSub.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.497
No telling what he'll do to Billy.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.955
No!

03:57.250 --> 03:58.410
Please!

03:58.830 --> 04:00.206
Please...

04:00.540 --> 04:02.076
Please, no!

04:35.330 --> 04:37.912
"Memory is
a complicated thing,

04:37.920 --> 04:40.662
"a relative to truth, but not its twin."

04:40.960 --> 04:42.530
Barbara Kingsolver.

04:42.540 --> 04:44.952
Apparently,
Billy was riding his bike home

04:44.960 --> 04:46.200
from his friend's house last night.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.666
They find the bike?

04:47.670 --> 04:49.956
No, the UnSub was smart enough
to cover his tracks.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.996
And he has the guts to take a good kid

04:52.000 --> 04:53.661
from a decent neighborhood.

04:53.670 --> 04:55.991
20 pm.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.991
The ride home
was less than a half a mile.

04:59.210 --> 05:00.825
You're on speaker, Garcia.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.377
Okay,
I got the whole gang on.

05:02.380 --> 05:03.995
It looks like the first victim

05:04.000 --> 05:05.911
was definitely held in captivity

05:05.920 --> 05:07.706
-in Crawford, Arizona.-Why is that?

05:07.710 --> 05:10.281
Because a woman walked
into Crawford P.D. this morning

05:10.290 --> 05:13.248
says she remembers a boy
in chains, in Crawford,

05:13.250 --> 05:14.569
30 years ago.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.377
Just like the boy found last night.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.699
Is she still at the station?

05:17.710 --> 05:19.496
No. She dropped
that bomb of information

05:19.500 --> 05:20.660
and then she took off.

05:20.670 --> 05:22.991
Her name's Samantha Allen.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.207
Most documents have her
listed as Sam Allen.

05:25.210 --> 05:27.747
36, never married, born and raised

05:27.750 --> 05:29.377
and lived her whole life in Crawford,

05:29.380 --> 05:31.109
owns and operates a nursery,

05:31.120 --> 05:32.576
the plant kind, not the baby kind.

05:32.580 --> 05:34.992
Mother died when she was 5,
dad's a real estate developer.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.490
Is there security footage?

05:36.500 --> 05:37.740
Yes. I'm sending that to you.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.240
It's on your tablets right now.

05:40.750 --> 05:43.412
What's she looking at?
ROSSI: I can't tell.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.241
What happened?-It looks like she was spooked.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.376
Dave, you and Prentiss

05:51.380 --> 05:52.665
see if you can find Samantha Allen.

05:52.670 --> 05:54.570
Reid and I will get set up at the station.

05:54.580 --> 05:57.538
All we can hope is that Morgan
and JJ get through to the survivor.

05:59.420 --> 06:00.956
You can't examine the scars?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.075
I can't get close enough.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.617
He has the most severe case
of CER I've ever seen.

06:04.620 --> 06:06.201
Conditioned emotional response.

06:06.210 --> 06:07.700
I've only seen it in vets.

06:07.710 --> 06:09.246
That's worse than PTSD.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.877
He had an adrenaline rush
when he escaped,

06:10.880 --> 06:13.075
but coming down from that
will be just as extreme.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.036
And I'm sure he's
sensitive to light and sound.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.417
Incredibly. We're keeping it
as quiet and dark as possible.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.614
It's probably what he's used to.

06:18.620 --> 06:20.110
He's also been somewhere cramped.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.418
His legs show signs
of advanced arthritis.

06:22.420 --> 06:23.876
Any idea how old he is?

06:23.880 --> 06:25.825
It's hard to tell.
His growth has been stunted.

06:25.830 --> 06:27.707
He's got major tooth and skin decay,

06:27.710 --> 06:29.871
clearly from a massive
vitamin D deficiency.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.074
Best guess?

06:32.540 --> 06:33.575
Maybe 16.

07:05.750 --> 07:06.876
Hey.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.029
My name's Derek.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.416
I'm one of the good guys.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.660
And this is my friend.

07:13.670 --> 07:14.910
I'm Jennifer.

07:15.330 --> 07:17.070
You're safe now.

07:17.330 --> 07:19.207
Doctor says
you haven't been eating much.

07:20.420 --> 07:21.910
Food looks pretty good.

07:23.250 --> 07:24.990
You must be thirsty.

07:25.750 --> 07:26.876
Here you go.

07:28.290 --> 07:29.917
Okay. It's okay.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.456
It's okay.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.031
JJ, this is years of conditioning.

07:35.290 --> 07:37.747
Have Garcia go back
to 2000 for missing kids.

07:37.750 --> 07:38.785
Yeah.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.069
Detective, I'm Agent Hotchner.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.287
-Detective Perez.
-This is Dr. Reid.

07:54.290 --> 07:55.575
I thought your team was bigger.

07:55.580 --> 07:57.070
The rest are following other leads.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.616
Is CARD retracing the escape route

07:58.620 --> 07:59.826
that the boy in chains took?

07:59.830 --> 08:01.206
They have been canvassing all night.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.910
There's another team in Flagstaff

08:02.920 --> 08:04.706
retracing Billy Henderson's bike ride.

08:04.710 --> 08:05.950
Where are Billy's parents?

08:05.960 --> 08:07.700
Chief's office.
-Thank you.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.951
Detective, you talked
to Sam Allen over here

08:09.960 --> 08:11.700
and it looked like one of
these photos upset her.

08:11.710 --> 08:13.325
Do you have any idea why?

08:13.670 --> 08:15.706
-Yeah, well it's weird.
-Why's that?

08:15.710 --> 08:17.826
Because most of these people
have passed away.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.111
That's our old chief.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.327
That one there, he built the station

08:22.330 --> 08:23.820
and some of the houses around here.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.535
It's J.B. Allen,

08:25.540 --> 08:26.780
Sam's father.

08:39.790 --> 08:41.496
Hi, there. Can I help you?

08:41.500 --> 08:43.206
We're with the FBI.

08:43.710 --> 08:46.326
We heard you were at
the police station earlier.

08:46.330 --> 08:49.879
I told the other detective,
that was a mistake.

08:50.250 --> 08:53.242
Why did you leave the station
when you saw you father's photo?

08:53.250 --> 08:54.376
I didn't.

08:54.380 --> 08:55.995
We saw the security footage.

08:56.380 --> 08:59.281
You told them you saw a boy in chains
when you were a kid.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.826
Why do you think your father
had something to do with this?

09:02.830 --> 09:04.661
He doesn't. I never said that.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.456
My father is a good man.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.491
This isn't about him, okay?

09:09.500 --> 09:12.287
I told the other detective,
I made a mistake.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.911
You know what I think?

09:15.540 --> 09:17.701
I think you saw the news
coverage of that little boy

09:17.710 --> 09:20.452
they found last night,
and it triggered something.

09:20.710 --> 09:23.281
If you know anything that can help us

09:23.290 --> 09:25.076
and you're keeping it to yourself,

09:25.080 --> 09:27.708
that's as_horrendous _
as what's happening to those children.

09:27.710 --> 09:29.416
Look, I'm sorry.

09:29.790 --> 09:31.576
I really, really am.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.451
But I... I can't help you.

09:39.290 --> 09:40.416
Come on, Randy.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.411
Listen, I know how scared you are.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.666
I know you think he can still hurt you,

10:08.670 --> 10:10.319
that he's just outside that door.

10:10.330 --> 10:11.957
But I promise you he's not.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.615
Even if he was,

10:14.620 --> 10:16.497
he'd have to get through me
to get to you,

10:17.250 --> 10:19.571
and I'm not about to let that happen.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.871
_ So it sounds like _
Billy's always been cautious.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.701
He's our oldest.
And he follows the rules.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.786
It drives his little sister crazy

10:48.790 --> 10:50.417
'cause she's the opposite.

10:51.210 --> 10:52.416
And he rides his bike a lot?

10:52.420 --> 10:54.115
All the time.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.280
Even at night?

10:55.290 --> 10:56.996
He's got lights and reflectors.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.072
He even has a headlamp on his helmet.

11:00.420 --> 11:02.376
We used to ride with him, but he's 13.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.878
He was only two streets over.

11:07.620 --> 11:09.611
And you feel pretty certain
that he wouldn't go anywhere

11:09.620 --> 11:10.780
with a stranger?

11:10.790 --> 11:12.667
No. No way. Never.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.491
If someone asked for help,
would he stop?

11:15.500 --> 11:16.615
Hold on.

11:16.620 --> 11:18.497
Are you saying that Billy
was taken because he's polite?

11:18.500 --> 11:21.822
I'm not saying
that it's his fault or yours.

11:22.790 --> 11:24.166
Billy is a cautious child,

11:24.170 --> 11:25.876
and that will be his strength right now.

11:54.830 --> 11:56.411
She left after seeing
a photo of her father?

11:56.420 --> 11:57.535
Did she accuse him?

11:57.540 --> 11:59.110
No, the opposite. She protected him.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.701
Garcia ran her mental health history.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.746
She had some grief counseling
after her mother died,

12:02.750 --> 12:04.286
but other than that, no therapy.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.950
We can talk to her but
we can't force her to help.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.326
No, but something in her gut
brought her in here.

12:09.330 --> 12:10.877
If there's any truth to her instincts,

12:10.880 --> 12:12.609
there's gonna be some kind
of a record of a missing boy

12:12.620 --> 12:13.780
from 30 years ago.

12:13.790 --> 12:15.496
Well, have Garcia
check unsolved cases

12:15.500 --> 12:17.286
and also check into J.B. Allen's history.

12:17.290 --> 12:19.417
-We can't rule anybody out.
-Okay.

12:19.420 --> 12:21.160
How are Morgan and JJ
doing with the boy?

12:21.420 --> 12:23.456
He's so traumatized,
he can't even speak.

12:25.540 --> 12:27.201
Give me everything
you have on J.B. Allen

12:27.210 --> 12:29.326
and also all of the unsolved missings.

12:29.330 --> 12:32.117
You know what,
go back to 1980 just to cover bases.

12:32.620 --> 12:33.780
Thanks, Garcia.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.326
It's okay. It's okay.

13:02.710 --> 13:04.325
What did Garcia find out?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.536
She broadened her search,

13:06.540 --> 13:08.781
but nothing
that matches his description.

13:10.580 --> 13:12.491
Somebody's gotta be missing this kid.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.826
No, hey, hey, no. No, no.

13:15.830 --> 13:17.240
That's not for us. That's not for us.

13:17.250 --> 13:18.740
It's for the doctors outside.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.615
It's for the doctors, not for us.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.325
It's all right.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.706
It's okay. It's not for us.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.746
There you go. Come on back.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.820
Here. Just take it.

13:32.540 --> 13:33.780
There you go.

13:35.460 --> 13:38.952
I got him to nod,

13:38.960 --> 13:41.417
but not much more than that.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.536
And you asked him his name?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.075
Yeah.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.497
What about in Spanish?

13:47.500 --> 13:49.456
It doesn't matter the language
if he won't talk.

14:05.620 --> 14:06.951
What's your name, sweetheart?

14:10.380 --> 14:12.109
Can I see what you have there?

14:13.540 --> 14:14.575
Ah.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.529
Do you like eagles?

14:20.880 --> 14:24.077
Yeah, the wings are beautiful,
aren't they?

14:28.080 --> 14:30.492
Your back

14:30.960 --> 14:33.076
Wings on your back...

14:35.500 --> 14:36.535
Angel?

14:38.040 --> 14:39.416
Is your name Angel?

14:49.880 --> 14:51.916
So, softball,
basketball, and soccer.

14:52.210 --> 14:53.871
You played a lot of team sports.

14:53.880 --> 14:54.995
Was your dad a coach?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.992
No. He was always too busy with work.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.911
I guess that's why he kept me busy.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.569
It was okay, though.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.780
The house was too quiet
after Mom died.

15:04.210 --> 15:05.529
She had cancer.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.168
I didn't really know
what that meant growing up,

15:08.170 --> 15:12.288
just that she wasn't gonna get
any better.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.456
Okay.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.279
Let's start with today.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.410
What brought you in here?

15:18.420 --> 15:21.617
I saw that... That boy on the news.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.245
And I saw...

15:25.620 --> 15:27.030
I can't really explain it.

15:27.040 --> 15:31.079
It was like a movie in fast-forward.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.529
It was dark.

15:35.460 --> 15:36.950
So dark.

15:38.290 --> 15:40.326
And that... That little boy,

15:40.330 --> 15:44.118
he had the same chains on his ankles.

15:46.670 --> 15:48.991
And then it was over.

15:49.750 --> 15:52.162
Those flashes that I saw.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.706
That boy...

15:56.380 --> 15:57.608
Was he real?

15:57.620 --> 15:59.247
That's what we need to find out.

16:07.620 --> 16:08.746
Thanks, JJ.

16:08.750 --> 16:09.876
Is the boy talking?

16:09.880 --> 16:11.825
No, but they figured out
that his name is Angel.

16:11.830 --> 16:14.037
Garcia sent a list
of all missing kids since 1980

16:14.040 --> 16:15.610
with a concentration
in the southwest US.

16:15.620 --> 16:17.030
Most are runaways.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.325
All right, let's eliminate the runaways

16:18.330 --> 16:19.991
and focus on lower-risk victims.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.536
Whoever's doing this
likes the challenge.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.531
Here's the thing.
This UnSub is too controlled

16:23.540 --> 16:24.871
to let his victims escape.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.074
I think Angel must have found a way

16:26.080 --> 16:27.877
_ because he was
beIng transferred somewhere.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.416
I'm running out of options here.

16:29.420 --> 16:31.661
The state troopers
are eliminating roadblocks,

16:31.670 --> 16:33.206
and CARD is coming up empty.

16:33.210 --> 16:34.666
If J.B. Allen is a suspect,

16:34.670 --> 16:36.661
why aren't we just kicking down
his door?

16:36.670 --> 16:37.876
Because it's too rislq.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.279
If Allen is who we're looking for,

16:39.290 --> 16:41.702
he has a psychiatric disorder
that drives everything he does.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.450
He'll do whatever it takes to hide Billy,

16:43.460 --> 16:44.609
but he'll sacrifice him

16:44.620 --> 16:46.281
if it means protecting his own freedom.

16:46.290 --> 16:48.952
Everything that this
UnSub does is methodical.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.916
He had a secure place
to keep Angel for years,

16:50.920 --> 16:53.115
but when Angel escaped,
he didn't mourn his loss.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.451
He drove straight to Flagstaff.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.820
The questions is,
why did he choose Flagstaff?

16:56.830 --> 16:58.411
He'd only drive 60 miles out of his way

16:58.420 --> 16:59.956
if he knew someone was there
to make him feel better.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.780
We don't think that Billy
was a victim of opportunity.

17:01.790 --> 17:02.996
We think he was the target.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.615
So this isn't a stranger abduction.

17:04.620 --> 17:06.417
Chances are
he'd seen Angel before, too.

17:06.420 --> 17:07.569
The question is,

17:07.580 --> 17:09.662
where would he have access
to both of these children?

17:12.580 --> 17:14.241
Who should we be looking at?

17:14.710 --> 17:17.326
Friends, neighbors,
coaches, other parents.

17:17.710 --> 17:20.167
We believe that this man
has met Billy before.

17:20.170 --> 17:25.073
VVhat

17:25.080 --> 17:27.571
I'm saying he talked to him
long enough to earn his trust.

17:28.540 --> 17:31.418
But the other little boy,
the one that you just found,

17:31.420 --> 17:33.285
I mean, why don't you ask him
who's doing this?

17:33.830 --> 17:35.912
He's not talking to us yet.

17:36.540 --> 17:38.326
Oh, my God.

17:38.330 --> 17:40.036
Well, what happened to him?

17:43.330 --> 17:44.820
Oh, my God!

17:47.080 --> 17:48.911
That's right. That's right. Bring it over.

17:50.290 --> 17:52.201
Angel, that's pretty good, my man.
You got it.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.785
Keep going.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.115
Okay, please tell me
you found something.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.496
I want to tell you that.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.616
JJ, there's not a single kid
in the tri-state area

17:59.620 --> 18:01.497
who's gone missing
whose name is Angel.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.456
I did a nationwide search.
Still nothing. Zilch.

18:03.790 --> 18:05.530
Why wouldn't he be reported missing?

18:05.540 --> 18:06.825
You tell me.

18:06.830 --> 18:09.913
There's a lot of undocumented
workers In Arizona.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.035
Yes, I know.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.701
I've pulled harvest schedules already.

18:12.710 --> 18:14.826
But what about
school registrations?

18:14.830 --> 18:16.286
There are more Angels than you think.

18:16.290 --> 18:18.281
We think he's been held
for a long time.

18:18.290 --> 18:20.781
Did any of them drop out
during grade school?

18:20.790 --> 18:22.610
Go back to at least 2004.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.451
2004. 2004...

18:26.330 --> 18:28.036
Second-grader Angel Suarez.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.871
-You got a picture?-Yes.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.497
And if I run my simulation
sothare to age him eight years...

18:34.960 --> 18:36.700
He'd be the boy that's in
the room with you right now.

18:36.710 --> 18:37.916
It's him, JJ.

18:38.420 --> 18:40.490
You are amazing. Thank you.
Can you send...

18:40.500 --> 18:43.162
_ Yes. Send his mother's
Information to you right now.

18:43.170 --> 18:44.785
You're the best. Bye.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.706
That sounded like good news.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.996
I'm about to call Angel's mom.
He's responding to Morgan.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.115
Okay, Angel, the doc's here.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.496
You want me to stay?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.410
All right, I'll be right outside.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.166
Okay.

19:07.620 --> 19:09.110
Hey, Angel.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.031
You're doing great.

19:11.460 --> 19:13.917
Your mom will be so happy to see you.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.371
Okay.

19:22.380 --> 19:24.746
It's okay. We can start again.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.031
I'd like you to close your eyes.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.070
Please.

19:32.210 --> 19:33.950
Close your eyes.

19:34.210 --> 19:36.326
Concentrate on your breathing.

19:38.290 --> 19:39.780
-Okay.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.610
You said it was dark.

19:42.330 --> 19:44.571
You were in your pajamas.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.957
Yes. I was burning up.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.529
You probably had a fever.

19:49.540 --> 19:51.076
What did you do?

19:51.080 --> 19:52.820
I called out for my mom,

19:53.290 --> 19:55.451
but she wasn't strong enough,

19:55.880 --> 19:58.110
so I got into bed with her.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.951
Was your dad there?
-No.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.241
Did you hear anything?

20:03.250 --> 20:04.786
My mom's breathing.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.240
Was she having trouble?

20:07.580 --> 20:08.990
Yes.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.991
It's a strange sound.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.951
Was there
another noise in the house?

20:15.080 --> 20:18.868
There's something else,
but I can't see anything.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.108
I followed it.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.281
My feet are so cold.

20:22.290 --> 20:23.826
Because you were outside?

20:23.830 --> 20:25.912
No. The basement.

20:28.380 --> 20:29.916
I see him.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.785
No, I was too scared.

20:31.790 --> 20:34.532
No, no.
I go back up to my parents' bedroom.

20:34.790 --> 20:36.872
Mommy. Mommy.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.075
But I peeked out the window.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.281
And there's the boy.

20:44.290 --> 20:45.746
What is he doing?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.952
He's trying
to get out of that truck.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.370
He's trying to get out of...

20:55.580 --> 20:57.491
Is your dad driving the truck?

20:57.500 --> 20:59.741
-No, no. He couldn't have done this.
-Okay.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.911
You don't understand.
He raised me in that house.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.821
He couldn't have been
doing that all these years.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.616
_ -No!
Okay. Okay.

21:06.620 --> 21:08.611
J.B.'s friends with the whole town.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.416
Never remarried.

21:10.420 --> 21:11.785
Raised Sam by himself.

21:12.670 --> 21:14.570
That's why this is so painful for her.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.740
She doesn't want to believe
that he's capable of it,

21:16.750 --> 21:18.490
but her memory's telling her differently.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.569
So you believe her?

21:20.620 --> 21:23.748
It's very hard to fake
visceral reactions like that.

21:24.460 --> 21:26.109
Yeah, but she's talking about a time

21:26.120 --> 21:27.496
of serious trauma,

21:27.960 --> 21:30.497
on a night she climbed into
bed with her dying mother.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.536
That plus her age,

21:32.540 --> 21:35.077
it's the perfect storm
for a recovered memory.

21:35.330 --> 21:37.457
Wasn't that a huge therapy trend
in the '805?

21:38.750 --> 21:42.868
A lot of women manufactured memories
of their fathers doing horrific things.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.416
And a lot of misguided therapists

21:44.420 --> 21:46.206
_con_vinced them
that their nightmares were real.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.821
It was a huge waste of our resources.

21:49.290 --> 21:51.918
I'm just not sure about this.

21:52.580 --> 21:54.571
I think she's credible enough to warrant

21:54.580 --> 21:56.491
discreet rolling surveillance.

21:57.210 --> 21:59.246
You'll have to use your own team,

21:59.250 --> 22:01.206
'cause he'd recognize
members of this force.

22:01.210 --> 22:03.997
If he has Billy, he won't
hesitate to get rid of him.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.116
I'll get a CARD team member
to join Reid.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.111
Allen can't know we suspect him.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.376
You know, if J.B. Allen is our UnSub,

22:17.380 --> 22:19.109
he certainly doesn't seem unhinged.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.326
He went to the market today,

22:20.330 --> 22:21.820
and he stopped by
his daughter's nursery,

22:21.830 --> 22:23.957
and right now
I'm watching him landscaping.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.746
-At his house?-Yeah.

22:25.750 --> 22:27.035
Is it isolated?

22:27.040 --> 22:28.701
Incredibly isolated.
There's a lot of land.

22:28.710 --> 22:30.871
You remember
what Garcia sent us on J.B. Allen?

22:30.880 --> 22:34.202
He started his contracting business
in 1975,

22:34.210 --> 22:36.030
married Sam's mom that same year.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.576
She died when Sam was 5, as we know.

22:37.580 --> 22:38.911
He never remarried,

22:38.920 --> 22:40.285
and despite
the newer subdivisions he built,

22:40.290 --> 22:42.326
he stayed in the house
he shared with his wife.

22:42.330 --> 22:44.070
So he's either sentimental,

22:44.080 --> 22:45.911
or he didn't sell because
he's customized the house

22:45.920 --> 22:47.205
to hide his victims.

22:47.210 --> 22:48.700
Do you think Angel blames himself?

22:50.580 --> 22:51.911
I know I did.

22:53.420 --> 22:55.115
You know, seeing his mom
for the first time

22:55.120 --> 22:56.610
may not go well.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.496
Well, right now it's just
about the shame he's feeling.

22:59.500 --> 23:02.242
She's gonna have to realize that
he may not want to see her for a while.

23:04.830 --> 23:06.457
Angel. Angel?

23:06.460 --> 23:07.575
Angel, no, no! Angel, no, no!

23:07.920 --> 23:10.787
-Angel, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

23:10.790 --> 23:12.166
It's okay.

23:12.170 --> 23:13.910
JJ, get a towel. It's okay.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.456
Angel, listen to me. You're safe.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.109
You're safe. It's okay.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.997
Angel, you're safe.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.877
It's all right.

23:28.710 --> 23:31.782
Please. He's right there.
I have to. I have to see him.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.327
I thought he was gone all these years.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.570
My sweet boy.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.616
Don't you understand?
I need to hold him.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.416
Okay. Listen.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.452
Angel hasn't been held
in a very long time.

23:43.460 --> 23:45.951
Things happened to him.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.200
He's going to have a hard time at first.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.115
Come on.

24:00.620 --> 24:02.281
I know this isn't easy for you.

24:03.500 --> 24:06.071
IfI accuse him and he's done nothing...

24:06.960 --> 24:08.370
Then I've betrayed him.

24:08.380 --> 24:12.248
But if he has, you'll save a young boy.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.412
The best way for you to recover
more of your memory

24:15.420 --> 24:18.662
is to return to the source
of the InItIal sensory trigger.

24:18.670 --> 24:19.989
That was the basement.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.661
How do I explain going down there?

24:21.670 --> 24:23.490
Did he have anything of yours
down there?

24:24.580 --> 24:25.706
Yeah.

24:25.710 --> 24:27.166
See if you can get it back.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.530
Help!

24:37.540 --> 24:39.280
Help!

24:39.290 --> 24:41.030
Help!

24:41.960 --> 24:44.201
Please help me!

24:44.210 --> 24:46.952
-I have to help my boy.
-And you will.

24:47.290 --> 24:48.700
But first, we need your help.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.956
Someone else's little boy is missing.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.666
We're trying to find out
how this man knew

24:52.670 --> 24:54.877
both your son and Billy, and to do that,

24:55.670 --> 24:59.242
I need to know everything that
happened the day Angel disappeared.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.377
It was a Tuesday,

25:01.380 --> 25:02.745
after school.

25:03.420 --> 25:06.287
The children were in the front yard.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.916
It started raining,

25:09.710 --> 25:12.702
but Angel never came back in.

25:13.460 --> 25:15.371
Did you see anyone talking to them?

25:15.380 --> 25:18.497
No. No cars. Nothing.

25:22.580 --> 25:26.209
The neighbors,
the neighbors helped me look.

25:26.210 --> 25:28.417
I wanted to tell the authorities.

25:28.420 --> 25:29.785
I really did.

25:32.580 --> 25:34.457
But we'd have to leave the country

25:34.460 --> 25:36.951
and I had to think of my entire family.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.536
You just have to talk to him, Sam.

25:46.290 --> 25:47.917
You can do this.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.035
Right.

26:06.580 --> 26:08.116
Dad?

26:08.960 --> 26:10.279
You home?

26:10.290 --> 26:12.030
Back here!

26:15.580 --> 26:17.161
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:17.170 --> 26:19.536
-The yard looks good.
-Oh, thanks.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.320
The kids at _the store said
you were gomg to Phoenix,

26:22.330 --> 26:24.821
but I saw your truck
down at the police station.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.668
Oh, yeah.
Their order for potted palms came in,

26:28.670 --> 26:31.878
so I just...
I dropped it off at the station.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.491
Chili. You want a bowl?

26:34.500 --> 26:36.991
It smells great, Dad, but I can't stay.

26:37.460 --> 26:39.872
Since when? It's my chili.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.241
He's not trying to get her out of there.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.410
Not yet.

26:43.420 --> 26:45.991
Hey, is my old catcher's mitt
still down in the basement?

26:46.290 --> 26:47.700
Yeah. Why?

26:47.960 --> 26:50.326
I was thinking about coaching
softball down at the rec.

26:50.790 --> 26:52.667
Yeah? That's great.

26:52.670 --> 26:54.877
You still got the home run record,
you know.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.324
Yeah, I know.

26:56.330 --> 26:58.161
That practice paid off, huh?

26:58.960 --> 27:00.996
Is it... It's still in the bin?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.956
Yeah. Let me get it.
-No, that's okay. I got it.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.666
Uh...I don't think so.

27:05.670 --> 27:07.285
I got boxes everywhere.

27:07.580 --> 27:10.322
I've been trying to
sort through some things.

27:10.330 --> 27:12.457
I'm thinking of having
a yard sale next week.

27:12.460 --> 27:13.779
You want in?

27:13.790 --> 27:15.997
Sounds good, but come on. I can get it.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.996
Suit yourself.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.115
He let her go down there.

27:45.120 --> 27:47.168
Yeah, but he hesitated.

27:47.170 --> 27:49.957
He's not acting like he's got
something to hide, Emily.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.996
That's how he's gotten away with it.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.115
We don't know that.

28:03.330 --> 28:05.491
You find it?

28:06.580 --> 28:08.957
'Cause it's right over here.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.280
Thanks.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.700
Told you it was a mess down here.

28:13.710 --> 28:15.200
Yeah. Yeah.

28:17.210 --> 28:18.450
You sure you can't stay?

28:18.460 --> 28:20.109
Yeah. I'm not feeling great

28:20.120 --> 28:21.667
and I gotta get up early tomorrow.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.240
You going to Phoenix?

28:24.250 --> 28:26.957
Uh, pickups, deliveries.
It'll be a long one.

28:26.960 --> 28:27.995
Uh-huh.

28:30.880 --> 28:33.030
Okay, then. See you later, peanut.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.667
Later, Dad.

29:03.710 --> 29:04.870
I'm so sorry.

29:05.170 --> 29:07.206
It's okay. You did everything we asked.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.325
There was nothing
in the basement.

29:09.330 --> 29:10.536
I'm sorry.

29:14.540 --> 29:15.871
Now all we've got is the kid.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.412
It's called a challenge coin, Angel.

29:33.420 --> 29:36.412
Legend says an American pilot
in World War I

29:36.420 --> 29:38.069
was gunned down over Germany.

29:38.080 --> 29:42.119
And he c_rawled across _
no-man's-land Into French territory.

29:44.540 --> 29:46.246
He was desperate to survive.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.285
And he should have been safe,

29:49.290 --> 29:51.281
except that the French
thought he was a German.

29:56.330 --> 29:58.378
And he was almost executed.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.036
But he showed them a coin.

30:08.830 --> 30:10.991
It had his squadron's insignia on it.

30:11.460 --> 30:13.166
It was given to him by a fellow pilot

30:13.170 --> 30:15.491
so that they would never
forget what they shared.

30:17.750 --> 30:19.035
What happened to him?

30:23.580 --> 30:26.708
A French so_ldier _
recognized the msrgnla,

30:27.710 --> 30:29.996
and they set him free.

30:32.290 --> 30:35.168
Angel,
the man who took you took another boy,

30:35.170 --> 30:37.206
and we have to find him.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.450
Can you help us do that?

31:02.710 --> 31:03.995
Angel,

31:04.710 --> 31:06.371
I want you to have this.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.666
It's kept me safe.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.161
Listen to me.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.377
Carl Buford.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.576
That's the name of the man
who hurt me.

31:23.420 --> 31:25.820
I was just a young boy like you, Angel.

31:25.830 --> 31:28.572
And I thought about doing that
very same thing to myself.

31:28.580 --> 31:29.706
I did.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.071
Because the shame was too much.

31:34.670 --> 31:37.070
But instead,

31:37.080 --> 31:39.708
I kept the pain buried inside of me.

31:40.830 --> 31:42.878
And it tore me apart.

31:43.460 --> 31:46.873
But, Angel, I never let
that son of a bitch beat me.

31:48.380 --> 31:50.109
I never gave him that.

31:50.790 --> 31:53.953
I want to make this man pay
for what he's done to you.

31:54.290 --> 31:56.030
But I need your help.

31:57.830 --> 31:59.661
I promise you

31:59.670 --> 32:02.207
that whoever hurt you will not win.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.911
You and me together

32:05.330 --> 32:07.707
can take away what he kept from you

32:07.710 --> 32:10.372
and what he values the most,
and that's freedom.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.202
Angel, please.

32:15.710 --> 32:17.746
Will you help me do that?

32:19.210 --> 32:20.450
Yes.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.826
Can you tell us

32:26.460 --> 32:28.997
if any of these men look familiar?

32:34.080 --> 32:35.570
No.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.070
It was always too dark.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.246
-How do you feel?
-Like I failed.

32:45.830 --> 32:47.240
You didn't.

32:48.170 --> 32:50.115
I failed him.

32:50.960 --> 32:53.246
I actually thought he
could have done all of this.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.201
I think it took more

32:56.210 --> 32:58.576
than a buried memory to come in here.

32:58.880 --> 33:01.747
There is something
about your father's behavior,

33:02.830 --> 33:04.957
things he has said and done

33:05.460 --> 33:07.280
that have bothered you for a long time.

33:07.670 --> 33:09.319
You buried those.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.576
Just like the memory.

33:13.380 --> 33:14.824
Look”.

33:15.880 --> 33:19.873
You lost your mother
when you were very young.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.371
It would have been too devastating

33:22.380 --> 33:24.450
to lose your father as well.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.742
Repressing those memories
is a defense mechanism.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.160
So, um...

33:32.380 --> 33:34.245
What else did I bury?

33:34.920 --> 33:36.820
His mood swings, probably.

33:37.330 --> 33:41.778
Do you remember when
he was happy one day, angry the next?

33:44.000 --> 33:45.376
Yeah.

33:46.830 --> 33:48.912
And when his moods were extreme,

33:49.330 --> 33:51.070
did he give you gifts?

33:55.460 --> 33:56.870
How do you know that?

33:57.500 --> 33:59.115
What did he give you?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.536
A bike, once.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.997
Was that one that you had asked for?

34:06.170 --> 34:09.207
No. It was a BMX.

34:09.620 --> 34:10.996
Any others?

34:17.540 --> 34:19.326
My catcher's mitt from today.

34:27.620 --> 34:29.531
What did he do?

34:30.380 --> 34:32.325
You can tell me.

34:35.210 --> 34:37.417
He used to...

34:38.170 --> 34:39.819
He used to bite me.

34:42.460 --> 34:44.997
He hasn't for a while.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.071
But he did...

34:51.580 --> 34:53.536
He did other things.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.116
Will you let the doctor take a look?

34:57.120 --> 34:59.532
Maybe we can match dental records.

35:02.250 --> 35:03.410
Okay.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.700
What about a few years ago?

35:07.080 --> 35:09.378
In 2004, did he give you anything?

35:13.880 --> 35:16.246
That's the year he gave me Randy.

35:16.710 --> 35:17.916
Randy?

35:18.580 --> 35:20.241
My dog.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.161
He was just a puppy then.

35:22.170 --> 35:24.491
Guys, Sam's father gave her gifts,

35:24.500 --> 35:26.070
trophies, from each abduction.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.320
That's significant.

35:27.330 --> 35:29.412
I didn't know that's what they were.

35:29.670 --> 35:32.321
We need to find out if Angel
had a puppy the day he was taken.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.787
Yeah.

35:34.790 --> 35:35.996
That's right.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.821
Some of the neighbors were
giving them away that day.

35:38.830 --> 35:41.287
They had a whole box.

35:41.290 --> 35:43.872
But I wouldn't let the boys keep one.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.108
Hotch, you hear that?

35:45.120 --> 35:46.826
Yes. Thanks, JJ.

35:46.830 --> 35:48.036
Wait, Hotch, um...

35:49.580 --> 35:51.411
We're trying to get a dental match.

35:51.420 --> 35:53.069
He's got old bite marks on him.

35:54.540 --> 35:56.030
What is it?

35:56.040 --> 35:57.450
Oh, my...

35:57.460 --> 35:59.951
My dad has his teeth
recapped a few years ago.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.450
He said something like,

36:01.460 --> 36:03.246
"That's what happens when
you get older," or whatever.

36:03.250 --> 36:04.569
He made a joke about it.

36:21.540 --> 36:23.872
You better not give me any trouble.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.030
No! No!

36:29.580 --> 36:31.207
We're heading to Allen's house.

36:31.210 --> 36:33.075
You think he's got
a secondary location?

36:33.080 --> 36:35.457
He could, but guys like him
keep their victims close.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.916
We'll search every inch of the property.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.660
-Keep us posted.-Wi|l do.

36:40.460 --> 36:42.075
JJ?

36:42.080 --> 36:43.490
What's going on?

36:43.500 --> 36:45.070
They're going to find J.B. Allen.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.115
Morgan.

37:21.250 --> 37:22.706
Angel said it was always dark.

37:22.710 --> 37:24.075
He must have had him
underground somewhere.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.116
It's a big property. Let's keep looking.

37:56.170 --> 37:57.239
Oh, God.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.870
It's clear.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.666
His truck's still here. He may be, too.

38:04.670 --> 38:05.876
He wouldn't risk it.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.495
He's gotta have another vehicle.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.115
I'll get the roadblocks back up.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.701
Any idea where he would go?

38:10.710 --> 38:13.326
Someplace that feels like home.
Let's go.

38:13.710 --> 38:14.916
You're on speaker, Garcia.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.377
So I tracked J.B. Allen's
property developments

38:17.380 --> 38:19.826
over the last 30 years.
They're all over the map.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.240
Well, of Arizona, anyway.

38:21.250 --> 38:22.376
Sending it to you now.

38:22.380 --> 38:24.029
Hope you can make more
sense of it than I can.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.701
Thanks, Garcia.

38:25.710 --> 38:27.746
The one thing that your memory

38:27.750 --> 38:29.377
and Angel's escape have in common

38:29.380 --> 38:31.871
is he was getting rid of both boys.

38:31.880 --> 38:35.247
He would only do that if he had
another boy waiting in the wings.

38:35.250 --> 38:37.787
That means he met his victims before.

38:38.250 --> 38:40.036
How? I mean, they're hours apart.

38:40.040 --> 38:41.166
Look at the towns.

38:41.170 --> 38:42.410
He had subdivisions in all of them.

38:42.420 --> 38:43.785
Construction sites are a magnet

38:43.790 --> 38:45.030
for 10-to-12-year-old boys.

38:47.420 --> 38:48.489
He...

38:49.540 --> 38:53.249
He gave kids a ride
on the backhoe all the time.

38:53.830 --> 38:55.991
They would just line up for it.

38:56.710 --> 38:58.075
Oh, my God. I...

38:58.880 --> 39:01.417
I didn't know.

39:02.620 --> 39:04.611
_ We found
hIS target-rich envrronment.

39:04.620 --> 39:06.872
-The construction sites?-Yeah.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.916
See if Sam remembers a particular one

39:08.920 --> 39:10.456
that he took her to frequently.

39:10.460 --> 39:11.916
Just one place?

39:11.920 --> 39:13.114
He keeps
his victims for years.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.281
The burial sites would be
someplace specral,

39:15.290 --> 39:17.030
and he'd need a reason to revisit.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.372
Is there a favorite place
your dad likes to go?

39:19.380 --> 39:21.450
You mean like the lake or something?

39:21.460 --> 39:23.451
No. Most likely
having to do with his work.

39:23.460 --> 39:25.030
Somewhere he's proud of?

39:25.420 --> 39:27.206
-His first development.
-Where is that?

39:27.210 --> 39:29.701
In Mesa.
Every few years, he adds on to it.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.530
He adds another house?

39:32.540 --> 39:34.167
He says that it's the place
that reminds him

39:34.170 --> 39:35.455
how he got started.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.451
It set the foundation for everything.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.416
Did you hear that?-Loud and clear.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.957
Please! Somebody!

39:42.960 --> 39:44.575
Help me!

39:44.580 --> 39:46.286
Help!

39:47.830 --> 39:49.377
No!

39:50.420 --> 39:51.455
No!

40:12.710 --> 40:15.110
No! No!

40:39.250 --> 40:40.615
Billy.

40:40.620 --> 40:41.917
- -It's okay, you're all right.

40:41.920 --> 40:43.706
You're okay.

40:54.710 --> 40:56.666
Morgan, that's enough! That's enough.

41:54.710 --> 41:56.416
Are you ready, Angel?

42:01.750 --> 42:03.206
Yeah.

42:30.420 --> 42:31.910
Do you always keep one with you?

42:32.210 --> 42:33.279
Yeah.

42:33.790 --> 42:36.953
But the one I gave Angel
was the only one that had wings on it.

42:36.960 --> 42:38.780
You know Angel's
never gonna let that go.

42:40.250 --> 42:42.957
What you shared,
I know that wasn't easy.

42:43.620 --> 42:45.417
None of this is easy.

42:47.120 --> 42:49.577
I can't help but picture little Morgan.

42:50.830 --> 42:52.161
You were so alone.

42:53.420 --> 42:56.662
I'm here right now
because of what that man did to me.

42:57.830 --> 42:59.161
I know.

42:59.710 --> 43:02.031
I'm just sorry.

43:10.670 --> 43:13.821
"Nothing fixes a thing
so intensely in the memory

43:14.120 --> 43:15.997
"as the wish to forget it."
