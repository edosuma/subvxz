This is my country

01:38.162 --> 01:41.745
Land of my birth

01:41.917 --> 01:45.251
This is my country

01:45.421 --> 01:48.671
Grandest on earth

01:48.883 --> 01:51.919
l pledge thee my allegiance

01:52.095 --> 01:55.345
America the bold

To have and to hold

02:02.941 --> 02:06.357
This is my country

02:06.529 --> 02:09.898
That's Brandon Walsh
with the editorial board.

02:10.074 --> 02:14.653
Andrea Zuckerman,
editor-in-chief of the Blaze.

02:14.830 --> 02:19.539
Mrs. Teasley. Mr. Chapman.

02:21.504 --> 02:25.668
The three amigos,
Steve, Kelly and Donna.

02:29.263 --> 02:33.676
Dylan McKay and Brenda Walsh,
popular campus couple.

02:33.852 --> 02:36.473
Silver, l told you about that thing,
man. Come on.

02:38.524 --> 02:41.560
l pledge thee my allegiance

02:41.736 --> 02:45.152
America the bold

02:45.365 --> 02:48.781
For this is my country

02:48.953 --> 02:52.737
To have and to hold

02:53.708 --> 02:56.662
How many verses are there
in this song, anyway?

02:56.837 --> 02:58.711
l'm just curious.

02:58.881 --> 03:02.582
Brandon, before l forget,
Citizen Kane is Saturday night.

03:02.761 --> 03:04.421
You're kidding.

03:04.596 --> 03:06.802
lsn't it amazing
how it was made the same year

03:06.974 --> 03:08.765
as the time capsule we're unveiling?

03:08.934 --> 03:13.929
Yeah. Except l made plans
with Emily Saturday night.

03:15.317 --> 03:16.645
How'd you expect me to remember?

03:16.819 --> 03:19.191
You bought those tickets
two months ago.

03:19.363 --> 03:20.857
Well, if you'd rather go out with her

03:21.032 --> 03:24.448
than see a classic from
Hollywood's golden age, l understand.

03:24.619 --> 03:28.533
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

03:29.291 --> 03:36.374
This is my native land

03:40.346 --> 03:42.385
Thank you. That was terrific.

03:42.598 --> 03:45.932
l'd also like to thank our special guests
from the Class of '41 ,

03:46.103 --> 03:48.938
who invite all of you to take
a closer look at the time capsule.

03:49.106 --> 03:51.811
Thank you. We'll see you tomorrow.

03:58.075 --> 03:59.783
Silver, cut it out, will you?

03:59.952 --> 04:03.321
Just one sound bite, please.
That's all l ask.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.245
lt was very interesting learning
about what happened on this campus

04:06.418 --> 04:07.793
the night Pearl Harbor
was bombed.

04:07.961 --> 04:09.455
Yeah, if l had been around
back then,

04:09.630 --> 04:12.547
l would have definitely signed up to be
a Navy flyboy, know what l mean?

04:12.717 --> 04:15.006
McKay's a wimp.
l would have been a Marine.

04:15.178 --> 04:17.420
No, no, no. l would've worn my hair
like Betty Grable.

04:17.598 --> 04:19.257
Wait a second.
Aren't you the same people

04:19.433 --> 04:21.390
who were just putting down
the video yearbook?

04:21.560 --> 04:24.098
lf anything should be preserved
for posterity, it should be me.

04:24.314 --> 04:25.974
- No, you mean me.
- Me.

04:26.149 --> 04:27.607
Thanks a lot, guys. That was great.

04:28.026 --> 04:30.268
- Excuse me? l'm sorry.
- Really?

04:30.446 --> 04:31.940
What do you say
we do it one more time

04:32.114 --> 04:34.403
- so l can get a few cutaways?
- What do you say we don't.

04:34.576 --> 04:36.782
- What is this?
- So it was really fun doing that

04:36.953 --> 04:39.159
man-on-the-street interview with you.

04:39.331 --> 04:40.873
- Yeah, yeah.
- Guys, let's just do it.

04:41.083 --> 04:43.289
- Geek.
- Wait, wait, where do l go?

04:43.503 --> 04:46.290
- How do you think it came out?
- Scott, l haven't looked at it yet.

04:46.464 --> 04:48.503
We just shot it
before the assembly today.

04:48.675 --> 04:50.549
Oh. Right.

04:50.761 --> 04:51.875
- What?
- You're in.

04:52.054 --> 04:54.509
- What do l say?
- As soon as you're ready, Kelly.

04:54.682 --> 04:56.473
Okay, l'm ready, l'm ready.
Let's see.

04:56.643 --> 04:58.849
lf l could have anything
in that time capsule,

04:59.021 --> 05:00.432
it would be that snood right there.

05:00.606 --> 05:02.480
l would not wear a snood
in my hair.

05:05.028 --> 05:06.570
David.

05:07.614 --> 05:08.942
David.

05:11.994 --> 05:14.319
Mrs. Scanlon, l just saw Scott--

05:15.248 --> 05:17.490
Do you remember what Saturday is?

05:19.670 --> 05:23.750
- The big game?
- No. lt's the big birthday.

05:25.176 --> 05:27.749
lt's Scott's birthday.

05:27.929 --> 05:31.428
Now, what l thought we would do
is give him a party he will never forget.

05:32.601 --> 05:35.436
You know, l don't think Saturday
is such a good day.

05:35.647 --> 05:36.761
But it's his birthday.

05:36.981 --> 05:41.275
Well, yeah, but see, l'm MCing
this big dance going on that night.

05:41.487 --> 05:43.776
David Silver, l am surprised at you.

05:43.948 --> 05:47.531
You are Scott's oldest and closest
friend in the whole wide world.

05:47.744 --> 05:50.199
l can't even conceive
of having a surprise party for Scott

05:50.372 --> 05:52.614
if you're not there.
He'd be so disappointed.

05:52.791 --> 05:56.789
He'd never forgive either of us.
Now, who should we invite?

05:58.131 --> 05:59.874
You mean
you haven't invited anyone?

06:00.092 --> 06:02.215
About 25 kids would be perfect,
don't you think?

06:04.055 --> 06:05.549
Yeah.

06:11.146 --> 06:12.260
Denise, you have to come.

06:12.439 --> 06:15.108
You were Scott's girlfriend
in the fifth grade. You owe it to him.

06:15.276 --> 06:16.390
l don't owe him anything

06:16.569 --> 06:18.727
and don't keep saying
he was my boyfriend.

06:18.905 --> 06:21.360
lt's embarrassing now.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.039
Can l come in?

06:31.211 --> 06:32.705
Sure.

06:33.213 --> 06:36.333
Just please lose that hat.

06:36.509 --> 06:39.344
You know,
it's my birthday tomorrow.

06:39.554 --> 06:41.677
Listen, l know it's
Big Game Weekend

06:41.849 --> 06:44.470
but l'm going out
for dinner tomorrow night,

06:44.643 --> 06:48.475
and later on,
if you wanted to stop by...

06:48.648 --> 06:54.272
l'd love to but
l'm gonna be tied up pretty late.

06:56.199 --> 06:57.859
lt's cool.

06:59.744 --> 07:01.368
Scott.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.582
Happy birthday, man.

07:05.751 --> 07:09.831
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Thanks.

07:11.383 --> 07:12.960
Anything you want.

07:14.011 --> 07:15.885
They put the lamest stuff
in this time capsule.

07:16.055 --> 07:17.513
Oh, like you could do any better.

07:17.682 --> 07:19.805
l could do better than
a greasy pocket comb.

07:19.976 --> 07:23.060
- Oh, don't look now.
- Hi, guys.

07:23.230 --> 07:25.388
David, for the eighth time
the answer is no.

07:25.608 --> 07:26.806
What was the question?

07:27.026 --> 07:28.935
Didn't Brenda tell you
about the surprise party

07:29.112 --> 07:32.279
- going on tomorrow night?
- Oh, sorry, dude. l'll be in Baja.

07:32.449 --> 07:35.616
Well, when do l get to go on one
of these surfing safaris with you?

07:35.786 --> 07:37.494
When you're willing
to get your hair wet.

07:39.290 --> 07:40.784
- Bye.
- Listen, guys.

07:40.959 --> 07:42.750
All you have to do
is make an appearance.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.921
- David, we don't even know this guy.
- But he knows you.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.504
lt would make his whole year,
his whole life.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.916
l'll go.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.262
- l mean, if anyone else will.
- Yeah, who else is going?

07:54.308 --> 07:55.932
l'm not sure.

07:56.978 --> 07:59.101
l hate surprise parties.

07:59.439 --> 08:01.431
Sorry, David.

08:01.650 --> 08:05.019
- Maybe next year.
- Maybe never.

08:05.195 --> 08:08.030
You know, l don't get why you agreed
to put together a birthday party

08:08.199 --> 08:09.278
on Big Game Weekend.

08:09.450 --> 08:12.285
- Everyone's going to the dance.
- lt's his mother.

08:12.454 --> 08:15.371
She makes me feel
like l'm 8 years old.

08:16.083 --> 08:19.369
l've known Scott my whole life.
She was my den mother.

08:19.545 --> 08:22.250
- Yeah, but still, you don't have--
- No, l know, l made a mistake.

08:22.424 --> 08:25.591
l barely even talk
to the guy anymore.

08:25.761 --> 08:27.469
But l promised.

08:27.638 --> 08:31.173
The party's gonna be a total disaster
when nobody shows up.

08:32.184 --> 08:34.342
Look, l'll see what l can do, okay?

08:34.520 --> 08:36.559
All right, thanks.

08:45.451 --> 08:47.527
Spencer, l asked you not to do that.

08:47.703 --> 08:49.363
David, where are all
the kids you invited?

08:49.539 --> 08:51.081
Scott's gonna be here any minute.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.909
Well, l'm not exactly sure
who's coming yet.

08:54.127 --> 08:55.669
That was your department.

08:55.879 --> 08:56.910
Well, yeah, l know,

08:57.089 --> 08:59.758
but l told you it was gonna be hard
on such short notice to get--

08:59.926 --> 09:02.797
l'm sure you did
the best you could. Bradly!

09:03.388 --> 09:06.140
Get everybody in the foyer, please.
He's gonna be here any second.

09:06.308 --> 09:08.846
Come on, come on. Come on.

09:11.564 --> 09:14.565
Scott says you got a couple
rad new guns in your collection.

09:14.735 --> 09:16.359
Guilty as charged.

09:16.945 --> 09:19.151
So do you think we'd take
some target practise out back

09:19.323 --> 09:20.354
when Scott gets home?

09:20.575 --> 09:22.900
Well, guns aren't toys.
They're weapons.

09:23.078 --> 09:24.572
They should always
be treated as such.

09:24.746 --> 09:27.663
- Mr. Scanlon--
- Conrad, what are you doing?

09:28.876 --> 09:31.034
Tinka called. They're gonna
be here any second.

09:31.254 --> 09:34.837
- Well, nobody told me.
- Let's go, please.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.965
Okay, Davey,
you heard what the woman said.

09:39.138 --> 09:42.970
- Let's have a party.
- David, the lights.

09:44.185 --> 09:45.845
They're coming.

09:51.027 --> 09:54.147
- Surprise!
- Oh, my God.

09:54.322 --> 09:55.899
See why l hate these things?

09:56.116 --> 09:57.314
You came.

09:57.534 --> 10:00.903
Kids, kids, come on in.
You'll ruin the surprise.

10:01.789 --> 10:04.410
l don't believe this.

10:07.129 --> 10:08.409
Spencer.

10:08.589 --> 10:11.543
- That's it, l'm out of here.
- No, Steve, forget it.

10:11.717 --> 10:15.168
Only reason Brandon agreed to come
is because l swore that you'd be here.

10:15.388 --> 10:17.843
- And if you're not, he'll kill me.
- Conrad!

10:19.226 --> 10:20.720
Are you sure this is the right house?

10:20.895 --> 10:23.267
Yeah, Brenda said
5070 Foothill Drive.

10:23.439 --> 10:25.597
Well, if there's a party,
how come it's so dark?

10:25.775 --> 10:27.435
Oh, God,
they didn't do the surprise yet.

10:27.611 --> 10:29.354
We better get out of here.

10:37.539 --> 10:40.955
Hey, Brandon.
What are you doing here?

10:41.127 --> 10:44.626
Well, you know, Scott, we were
just out walking Emily's dog.

10:44.798 --> 10:45.829
Right.

10:46.883 --> 10:48.128
What dog?

10:48.343 --> 10:49.885
Surprise.

10:54.392 --> 10:55.767
Fooled you. Fooled you.

10:55.936 --> 10:58.723
No, as soon as l saw them, l knew.

10:58.939 --> 11:01.810
Scott, l totally forgot it was
a surprise, man. l'm sorry.

11:02.026 --> 11:03.983
lt's cool. ls Brenda here?

11:04.195 --> 11:06.900
Oh, yeah, yeah. Brenda and Steve
and Kelly and Donna.

11:07.115 --> 11:10.069
They're all here? lnside? Far out.

11:10.786 --> 11:13.324
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

11:15.625 --> 11:17.783
Thanks for everything, Mom.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.122
- Happy birthday, Scott.
- Thanks.

11:22.842 --> 11:27.054
Well, as long as you're here,
you might as well join the gang.

11:27.222 --> 11:28.846
Thanks.

11:36.065 --> 11:37.856
Well, we really pulled it off, huh?

11:38.068 --> 11:40.191
l don't know, David.
These friends you invited...

11:40.404 --> 11:43.440
First, they ruin the surprise
and not a single one brings a present.

11:44.701 --> 11:48.200
But l guess we'll just have
to make the best of it, won't we?

11:54.712 --> 11:57.203
David, are you coming in?

11:57.382 --> 12:00.418
l can't believe how clueless
that woman is.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.005
Who? Scott's mom?

12:02.179 --> 12:04.717
She acts like the party was ruined
because of me and my friends

12:04.891 --> 12:07.133
when she should be thanking me
for saving it.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.101
lt's not like Scott's Mr. Popular.

12:09.271 --> 12:12.640
No one would've even showed up
if it wasn't for you and me.

12:21.326 --> 12:22.820
Scott.

12:36.594 --> 12:38.752
How long did we commit to be here?

12:38.930 --> 12:41.172
We're on borrowed time as it is.

12:44.228 --> 12:46.897
David, unless you do
something drastic, this party is history.

12:47.065 --> 12:50.066
Well, can't you get them to hang on
until Mrs. Scanlon brings the cake?

12:50.235 --> 12:53.355
Everyone line up. lt's limbo time.

12:53.572 --> 12:56.526
That is it. l'm out of here.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.617
We're right behind you.

13:01.206 --> 13:04.290
Mom, my friends
don't wanna do the limbo.

13:04.460 --> 13:06.120
l'm sorry, we tried.

13:06.337 --> 13:08.211
Come with me, come on.

13:08.423 --> 13:10.748
Scott, you have yourself
a happy birthday, all right, pal?

13:10.926 --> 13:13.049
Wait a minute, you can't go.

13:13.262 --> 13:15.670
Oh, well, it's getting awfully late.

13:15.848 --> 13:18.600
l mean, will you look at that?
lt's 8:30 already.

13:18.768 --> 13:20.595
Guys, guys, guys,
l have an announcement.

13:20.771 --> 13:23.392
l need your help. Excuse me.

13:26.027 --> 13:28.944
Okay. Now, today's Scott's birthday

13:29.114 --> 13:31.605
and in order for me
to give him his present,

13:31.783 --> 13:33.491
you guys have to come get in a line.

13:33.702 --> 13:35.659
- So come on.
- We should make a run for it now.

13:35.830 --> 13:38.747
No, Steve, Kelly.
Come on, don't be shy.

13:38.958 --> 13:41.912
Brandon, Brenda, Emily,
all of you. Come on.

13:42.671 --> 13:44.663
- Steve.
- Silver.

13:46.676 --> 13:51.385
Now, if any of you have ever seen
Scott dance, it's not a pretty sight.

13:51.556 --> 13:54.308
So l need you guys
to help me teach

13:54.476 --> 13:56.682
this major stud how to dance.

13:57.605 --> 13:59.016
Music, maestro.

13:59.649 --> 14:02.484
This must be our punishment
for being late.

14:03.570 --> 14:05.361
Okay, okay, we got the beat.

14:05.990 --> 14:07.947
Go on, fellas, go on. Okay.

14:08.117 --> 14:12.031
Now, everybody get into it.
Come on.

14:12.247 --> 14:14.536
Okay, all right. Scott, you're off beat.

14:14.750 --> 14:17.075
lt's one, two, three.

14:17.253 --> 14:18.961
Yeah, good. Kind of getting into it.

14:19.130 --> 14:20.707
That's-- That's cool.

14:20.924 --> 14:24.625
And Brandon's just not even doing
anything but standing there.

14:24.845 --> 14:29.175
Brandon, come on.
Brandon, Brandon, Brandon.

14:29.350 --> 14:31.224
Emily, can you help me
with the--? No?

14:31.394 --> 14:34.311
Okay, okay.

14:34.481 --> 14:37.019
Scott, it's dancing.
Not a StairMaster.

14:37.193 --> 14:40.064
- Yeah, l got it. l know.
- Come on.

14:40.238 --> 14:46.573
Okay, okay, okay.

14:50.083 --> 14:53.286
Okay, everybody, follow along.
Follow along.

14:53.462 --> 14:55.253
Brenda's got it.

14:55.422 --> 14:58.921
Go, Scott. Go, Scott. Go, Scott.

14:59.135 --> 15:01.507
- Go, go, go.
- All right.

15:01.679 --> 15:05.297
Okay. Okay.

15:10.064 --> 15:11.475
- Wait, wait.
- You got it.

15:11.649 --> 15:14.354
You got it. Yeah.

15:14.569 --> 15:17.736
- Okay.
- Get them hips in it, baby.

15:20.493 --> 15:22.201
Hey, look out.

15:25.874 --> 15:29.208
Okay. Come on.

15:29.420 --> 15:33.370
What are you doing?
He's doing this thing.

15:35.010 --> 15:36.172
Oh, my God.

15:36.345 --> 15:39.216
Okay, time for birthday cake.

15:40.933 --> 15:43.602
- l was just getting the hang of it.
- You can do more later.

15:43.770 --> 15:46.771
The kids have to go to bed. l don't
want Darlene to get off her schedule.

15:46.940 --> 15:49.098
Okay, let's round everybody up.
Come on, Spencer.

15:49.276 --> 15:52.063
Spencer, pyjamas on before cake.

15:55.450 --> 15:57.277
Where's Brandon?

16:06.547 --> 16:09.998
Spencer, your pyjamas are in
the closet. Go put them on, please.

16:14.639 --> 16:16.133
Hi.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.513
- l'm sorry you feel that way.
- Brandon, where are you going?

16:19.729 --> 16:22.600
We appear to be setting a bad example
and we've been asked to leave.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.691
- l think that would be best.
- Yeah.

16:25.861 --> 16:27.735
Well, if you're out of here,
we're out of here.

16:27.905 --> 16:29.696
l'll get Kelly.

16:30.324 --> 16:33.527
- Brandon, l'm really sorry.
- That's not your fault, pal.

16:33.745 --> 16:37.031
- Peach Pit?
- Yeah, let's go see Nat.

16:37.958 --> 16:40.793
Scott, hope this didn't ruin
your party, man.

16:41.003 --> 16:44.170
- No. Thanks.
- Thanks for coming.

16:44.340 --> 16:47.009
- l really appreciate it.
- You're welcome. Bye.

16:47.177 --> 16:49.929
- Bye. Happy birthday.
- Bye, Brenda.

16:50.973 --> 16:52.467
You can come with us, you know.

16:53.518 --> 16:57.101
- Well...
- lt's okay.

16:57.272 --> 17:00.475
l know you'd rather be
with your friends.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.069
No, l think l'll stay.

17:04.239 --> 17:06.564
l promised his cousin
l'd teach her how to Freak.

17:06.742 --> 17:08.948
Okay. Bye. Bye.

17:10.621 --> 17:12.079
Bye, Donna.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.208
- Thanks for everything.
- No problem, man.

17:20.549 --> 17:24.796
Excuse me. This is my favourite part.

17:24.971 --> 17:27.260
Spencer, get your fingers
out of the icing.

17:27.473 --> 17:29.265
Mom, why'd you make
those kids leave?

17:29.435 --> 17:31.843
l wanted to see them
make out some more.

17:32.355 --> 17:35.107
We don't have any matches, David.

17:35.316 --> 17:38.352
- l'll get them.
- Get the lighter off my desk, son.

17:38.570 --> 17:39.981
Can l have the horse
and the lndian?

17:40.155 --> 17:43.358
No, you cannot.
lt's Scott's birthday, he gets the toys.

18:20.828 --> 18:22.737
- Big piece.
- Big piece.

18:22.913 --> 18:25.997
- Found some matches.
- Oh, good. Somebody get Scott.

18:26.918 --> 18:28.957
- Davey.
- Scott.

18:30.422 --> 18:31.964
Thank you.

18:32.925 --> 18:34.585
Scott, come on, they found some--

18:34.760 --> 18:37.429
Hey, David. Check this out.

18:37.806 --> 18:38.920
Scott.

18:39.808 --> 18:42.725
Scott. Scott, put that--

18:55.201 --> 19:01.703
There's a place for us

19:01.875 --> 19:06.870
Somewhere a place for us

19:07.090 --> 19:12.333
Peace and quiet and open air

19:12.513 --> 19:17.756
Wait for us somewhere

19:18.853 --> 19:23.432
There's a time for us

19:23.609 --> 19:28.852
l can't believe that just two days ago,
l was dancing at his house, and now...

19:31.159 --> 19:35.620
l don't wanna sound like a jerk,
but which one was Scott Scanlon?

19:37.083 --> 19:39.918
When you told me,
l thought it was that kid over there.

19:40.545 --> 19:42.668
lt's obviously not.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.046
No, Dylan. You knew Scott.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.876
He was David Silver's friend.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.055
Blond hair. He was in
your tech class last year.

19:51.683 --> 19:54.933
Oh, my God. That guy?

19:57.356 --> 20:02.398
My ears are ringing, l can't swallow.
My whole digestive system's a wreck.

20:02.905 --> 20:06.488
l know it's the flu.
lt's gotta be the flu.

20:06.909 --> 20:09.910
Well, whatever it is,
you're doing better than Scott.

20:13.083 --> 20:15.704
Do you know where David Silver is?
l have to talk to him.

20:15.878 --> 20:18.036
He didn't come to school today.

20:18.214 --> 20:21.998
- l feel so awful.
- Yeah, well, everybody does.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.300
No, Scott was my boyfriend
in the fifth grade.

20:24.471 --> 20:28.220
l've said probably two words
to him in high school. And now...

20:28.393 --> 20:30.599
lt's okay. Come here.

20:35.276 --> 20:39.570
Before concluding our memorial,
a couple of announcements.

20:40.365 --> 20:44.743
Private funeral services for the family
are being conducted this afternoon.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.491
And the counselling office
will be staying open later

20:49.334 --> 20:52.501
and is available for anyone
who would like to come in and talk.

20:52.963 --> 20:54.421
Thank you.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.966
You know, putting out
a special four-page insert

21:00.138 --> 21:02.177
in Scott's memory
is gonna be a lot of extra work.

21:02.349 --> 21:05.765
But now, l think that under
the circumstances, it's really important.

21:05.936 --> 21:09.020
Absolutely.
What did you have in mind?

21:09.232 --> 21:11.687
l just don't see why we need
to use this tragic accident

21:11.860 --> 21:14.777
as the springboard for some diatribe
about gun control.

21:14.988 --> 21:16.530
l'm sorry,
but as far as l'm concerned,

21:16.699 --> 21:18.442
a loaded gun
should not have been accessible

21:18.618 --> 21:20.527
in a desk drawer
of a house full of kids.

21:20.703 --> 21:22.909
l agree, but the story
speaks for itself.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.575
We need to focus
on the personal side.

21:24.750 --> 21:28.119
Get pictures of Scott, interview
David Silver, cover the funeral.

21:28.296 --> 21:29.920
And who gets
that plum assignment?

21:30.089 --> 21:33.292
Well, obviously
it shouldn't be Brandon.

21:33.468 --> 21:34.748
Why not?

21:34.928 --> 21:36.303
You really wanna go to the funeral

21:36.472 --> 21:38.797
after Mrs. Scanlon
kicked us out of Scott's party?

21:38.975 --> 21:40.220
She kicked you out?

21:40.810 --> 21:44.808
Yeah, she caught us making out
in his little brother's room and had a fit.

21:44.982 --> 21:46.773
Terrific.

21:46.942 --> 21:49.433
l guess l'll cover the funeral, then.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.317
- Andrea, l'll do it.
- Great.

21:52.490 --> 21:54.648
Why don't you bring Emily along
so you could rub salt

21:54.826 --> 21:56.735
- in Mrs. Scanlon's wounds?
- No, l'll go alone.

21:56.912 --> 21:58.536
l know how to be discreet.

21:59.415 --> 22:01.324
What's the matter with you, anyway?

22:02.544 --> 22:06.494
Nothing. l'm sure you'll do a fine job.

22:07.049 --> 22:09.540
Bryce, where's that
printing schedule?

22:14.599 --> 22:16.141
David.

22:18.020 --> 22:19.099
Hi.

22:19.271 --> 22:22.391
Hi. Where's Kelly?

22:23.401 --> 22:25.856
She wasn't feeling so well.

22:26.029 --> 22:27.404
Yeah, well, join the club.

22:27.573 --> 22:30.693
l almost lost it when they asked me
to say a few words about Scott.

22:30.868 --> 22:32.362
Why?

22:32.537 --> 22:34.909
Because l haven't been close
to him for almost a year.

22:35.081 --> 22:38.165
l wouldn't have
the faintest idea what to say.

22:40.254 --> 22:42.412
Plus, l had the most bizarre dream.

22:42.590 --> 22:44.084
What was it?

22:47.429 --> 22:48.971
David, you can tell me.

22:50.766 --> 22:52.640
lt was the night Pearl Harbor
was bombed,

22:52.810 --> 22:55.383
and we were all sneaking on campus
to bury the time capsule

22:55.564 --> 22:56.975
like they did in 1 941 .

22:58.025 --> 23:02.818
And when we dug the hole,
l realised it was a coffin.

23:04.532 --> 23:06.406
The body inside was me.

23:08.454 --> 23:09.699
Wow.

23:11.082 --> 23:16.753
And when l woke up, l kept saying,
it's not you, it's Scott.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.256
And l was happy.

23:23.054 --> 23:24.429
lsn't that sick?

23:25.432 --> 23:28.005
David, you're here.

23:30.771 --> 23:32.395
Eleanor.

23:32.565 --> 23:34.142
You know David Silver, don't you?

23:34.317 --> 23:37.104
He's Scott's bestest
bestest friend in the whole world.

23:37.613 --> 23:40.068
He was with us
every Fourth of July at Arrowhead.

23:40.241 --> 23:41.272
Scott just adored him.

23:41.993 --> 23:44.116
l'll see you after the service.

23:44.954 --> 23:46.697
lt's up to us now.

23:48.542 --> 23:51.294
Scott's memory is gonna be kept alive
by those of us who loved him.

23:51.462 --> 23:54.712
So come on inside,
l want you to meet everybody.

23:54.883 --> 23:56.377
You'll be sitting with the family.

23:56.551 --> 23:59.256
- But my dad is here--
- David, please.

24:00.472 --> 24:02.927
Cecil, have you met David Silver?

24:03.100 --> 24:06.849
He was Scott's bestest,
bestest friend in the whole world.

24:16.449 --> 24:18.904
Hey, your mom says
to come to bed.

24:19.244 --> 24:20.821
l'm out of here.

24:20.996 --> 24:23.487
Man, l've been staring
at this same page for half an hour.

24:23.833 --> 24:26.075
So give it a rest.
l mean, for tonight anyway.

24:26.294 --> 24:30.043
Yeah. Makes sense.

24:31.467 --> 24:33.175
lt's good to see your mug
around here, man.

24:33.386 --> 24:34.714
You and Bren seem pretty tight.

24:34.887 --> 24:37.674
Yeah. And l mean, you know,

24:37.849 --> 24:41.099
things seem to be going real well
with you and Em, it's cool.

24:41.270 --> 24:44.604
Our timing is just way off
with this whole death thing, you know?

24:45.149 --> 24:46.691
Yeah.

24:46.901 --> 24:50.352
l mean, l keep thinking
l should have died at least three times.

24:50.572 --> 24:53.063
Once on the mountain with you,
l almost drowned when l was 5,

24:53.242 --> 24:55.614
and l easily could've bought it
when l totalled Mondale.

24:55.828 --> 24:56.942
But you didn't.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.621
l could have.

25:02.127 --> 25:04.333
l don't know. The only thing
l can come up with is that

25:04.505 --> 25:06.379
someone up there must like me.

25:07.550 --> 25:11.382
Does that mean that somebody
up there didn't like Scott?

25:12.389 --> 25:14.180
l don't know, man.

25:15.685 --> 25:17.345
l don't know.

25:23.694 --> 25:26.019
- Hey, David.
- Hi.

25:26.197 --> 25:27.655
How you doing, man?

25:27.824 --> 25:29.982
l'm great, l'm doing good.
How you guys doing?

25:30.160 --> 25:31.951
We're fine.

25:32.621 --> 25:35.705
Well, that's-- That's good.
l'll talk to you later.

25:35.875 --> 25:37.417
All right.

25:38.336 --> 25:40.744
- Hey, Silver. How you doing, man?
- Hi, Steve.

25:40.923 --> 25:42.666
Looking good, buddy.

25:42.841 --> 25:44.798
Well, why shouldn't l?

25:44.969 --> 25:47.756
So tell me, did you actually
see the gun go off?

25:49.724 --> 25:50.755
Yeah.

25:50.976 --> 25:52.968
- There must've been tons of blood.
- Steve--

25:53.145 --> 25:55.102
lt's not every day
this kind of thing happens.

25:55.982 --> 25:59.185
Maybe it does happen every day
but not at West Beverly.

25:59.402 --> 26:01.774
Look, l gotta go.
l'll talk to you later.

26:01.989 --> 26:03.946
- Right. See you, bro.
- David.

26:04.116 --> 26:06.025
Hey, Kelly. Are you feeling better?

26:06.244 --> 26:09.411
Much better. My stomach
was on the warpath or something.

26:09.581 --> 26:12.416
Sorry l missed the funeral.
Was it creepy?

26:12.584 --> 26:14.161
lt was a funeral.

26:14.336 --> 26:17.919
Listen, l gotta go start my show.
l'll talk to you later.

26:18.675 --> 26:19.754
- David.
- Mr. Chapman.

26:19.926 --> 26:20.957
How are you doing?

26:21.136 --> 26:22.678
Listen, about
the time capsule project,

26:22.846 --> 26:24.838
l didn't have a chance
to get to it this weekend.

26:25.015 --> 26:27.886
David, David,
there's no rush on that.

26:28.061 --> 26:30.303
Oh, okay.

26:31.148 --> 26:32.891
- Talk to you later about this.
- All right.

26:33.066 --> 26:36.565
David, did you happen to remember
those pictures of you and Scott?

26:36.737 --> 26:39.442
- l'm sorry, l forgot.
- No problem.

26:39.616 --> 26:41.988
When do you think
we can do that interview?

26:42.160 --> 26:44.449
How about tomorrow?
Same time, same place.

26:44.622 --> 26:46.947
- Cool.
- Great.

26:56.051 --> 26:58.672
Hi, l was just wondering
how you're doing.

26:59.889 --> 27:03.507
Well, you're about the 1 9th person
to ask me that question today.

27:03.685 --> 27:04.764
Sorry.

27:04.979 --> 27:08.597
But to answer your question,
l'm fine, okay?

27:08.816 --> 27:10.440
l'm just fine.

27:21.164 --> 27:23.489
''They want you to believe
that guns don't kill people.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.125
That people kill people.

27:25.294 --> 27:26.669
But tell that to the 6000 children

27:26.837 --> 27:29.375
who die from gunshot wounds
each year.''

27:29.549 --> 27:31.292
ls that too strident?

27:31.468 --> 27:34.255
- No, it's fine. Go on.
- All right.

27:34.429 --> 27:36.837
''But Scott Scanlon
was more than a statistic.

27:37.016 --> 27:40.432
He was a product of
the West Beverly Hills school system.''

27:41.312 --> 27:44.479
l don't like the word ''product.''
What do you think?

27:50.990 --> 27:52.401
Yeah, it's great.

28:02.337 --> 28:05.623
lf Dylan calls,
tell him l'm at the library, okay?

28:05.799 --> 28:07.210
Sure.

28:08.219 --> 28:11.136
l don't know, can l trust you two
by yourselves?

28:11.306 --> 28:14.841
- Goodbye, Brenda.
- Goodbye.

28:23.695 --> 28:26.649
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Beats me.

28:38.003 --> 28:39.711
Emily.

28:39.881 --> 28:41.339
What?

28:43.969 --> 28:46.008
l don't know, l just feel so...

28:47.348 --> 28:48.890
Go ahead.

28:50.893 --> 28:52.802
Guilty. l feel guilty.

28:53.021 --> 28:55.726
- Guilty, about kissing me?
- No...

28:59.153 --> 29:02.439
l don't know, shouldn't we be serious
or in mourning or something?

29:02.615 --> 29:04.406
l mean, somebody just died.

29:05.452 --> 29:09.402
But we're alive, today anyway.

29:10.124 --> 29:12.579
Our number could be up tomorrow.

29:13.545 --> 29:15.003
That's true.

29:16.757 --> 29:18.714
People always talk about things
they wanna do

29:18.884 --> 29:23.262
and places they wanna go
before they die.

29:25.934 --> 29:29.184
Me, there's just one thing
l wanna do before l die.

29:42.704 --> 29:45.409
You know, David,
you gotta give yourself time.

29:45.582 --> 29:47.290
Dad, l know.

29:47.709 --> 29:52.455
All l'm saying is that for the first time,
l feel normal again.

29:52.673 --> 29:55.709
Well, that's great. That's great.

29:55.886 --> 29:59.635
You know, the human spirit has
a remarkable capacity to recuperate.

30:00.349 --> 30:02.887
They taught us that the first year
in dental school.

30:03.061 --> 30:06.015
But then, they were talking
about gingivitis.

30:07.816 --> 30:13.652
Yeah, well, thanks for the lift
and thanks for breakfast.

30:16.952 --> 30:18.066
Thanks, Dad.

30:20.956 --> 30:25.702
David. Hi, l...

30:28.423 --> 30:30.250
l'm sorry.

30:30.426 --> 30:32.999
l was just remembering
the last time l was here with you.

30:33.846 --> 30:35.423
But never mind that.

30:35.598 --> 30:37.840
l need you to come by the house
this afternoon.

30:38.435 --> 30:40.143
l wanna give you
some things of Scott's

30:40.312 --> 30:43.183
that l know that he would want
you to have.

30:51.742 --> 30:54.659
David, my mom and l want
to take you and your dad

30:54.829 --> 30:55.991
to dinner on Thursday night?

30:56.164 --> 31:00.542
- ls that okay with you?
- Yeah, that's fine. l gotta go.

31:00.711 --> 31:03.795
- Hey, big guy. How's it going?
- Fine.

31:03.965 --> 31:06.171
- David?
- Yes?

31:06.718 --> 31:09.470
Michael Shepherd offered
to edit that video if...

31:09.680 --> 31:11.304
Well, you said there was no rush.

31:11.849 --> 31:13.723
Well, we're just trying
to help you out.

31:13.935 --> 31:15.595
Well, l don't need any help.

31:15.770 --> 31:18.059
l shot the footage,
l should get to put it together.

31:18.273 --> 31:20.396
Okay, okay, you're right.

31:21.610 --> 31:24.694
- Just check in with me, will you?
- Sure.

31:25.281 --> 31:27.108
l thought you weren't doing
your show today.

31:27.283 --> 31:28.741
Of course l'm doing the show.

31:28.952 --> 31:31.988
Oh, well, usually you start on the hour
and it's a quarter past.

31:32.164 --> 31:34.785
l would've been here if everybody
would just get out of my face.

31:35.126 --> 31:36.157
David.

31:36.377 --> 31:39.960
l've got a show to do and l really
don't want to chitchat, okay?

32:00.614 --> 32:03.366
- Hey, Andrea, l need to talk to you.
- So talk.

32:03.534 --> 32:06.203
David Silver asked if he could
postpone his interview by one day.

32:06.371 --> 32:07.948
- And l told him--
- How can we do that?

32:08.123 --> 32:09.581
We've got a firm deadline.

32:09.749 --> 32:12.666
We might as well drop this whole
insert if that's gonna be his attitude.

32:12.836 --> 32:14.413
Hey, would you relax, please?

32:14.588 --> 32:17.293
Yes, it's gonna make it harder
to make the deadline but it's doable

32:17.467 --> 32:19.625
if l stay late and paste up
the board tomorrow night.

32:19.803 --> 32:22.258
- So, what did you ask me for?
- What's the matter with you?

32:22.431 --> 32:24.174
l'm having a hard time
putting this together

32:24.350 --> 32:26.841
without you jumping down my throat
every time l open my mouth.

32:27.020 --> 32:30.638
Excuse me. l thought it was so doable.
l thought you had it all under control.

32:31.608 --> 32:33.814
Are you mad because l didn't go
to the movies with you?

32:33.986 --> 32:37.070
ls that what this is about?
You said you understood.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.648
Well, maybe l don't understand.

32:40.202 --> 32:41.233
Maybe l don't like feeling

32:41.411 --> 32:43.902
like yesterday's news
every time she comes around.

32:44.081 --> 32:45.409
You shouldn't feel that way.

32:45.875 --> 32:48.448
Don't tell me how to feel, okay?

32:48.628 --> 32:51.499
l know she's your girlfriend,
l know l'll get used to it.

32:51.673 --> 32:55.505
But at this point, it still hurts, okay?

32:56.512 --> 32:57.970
Okay.

32:59.974 --> 33:02.845
Oh, my gosh.
Do you remember this?

33:03.270 --> 33:06.971
This was at Arrowhead. We had
the best fireworks that Fourth of July.

33:07.150 --> 33:08.774
You remember that?

33:10.487 --> 33:14.983
Scotty loved the Fourth of July.
That was his favourite holiday.

33:15.659 --> 33:17.283
Of course, he loved all the holidays.

33:17.453 --> 33:20.537
That's why l know he'd want you
to have his Christmas stocking.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.791
No, l really think you ought
to keep this.

33:23.961 --> 33:25.538
Oh, no, no, no.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.332
This is it.

33:28.508 --> 33:30.216
This is the one,

33:30.552 --> 33:34.217
the one l was looking for
that's got you and Scotty.

33:35.015 --> 33:38.051
- l've got that one at home.
- l know you're gonna treasure it.

33:39.604 --> 33:41.810
Mrs. Scanlon,
you're not listening to me.

33:42.023 --> 33:44.775
l really don't want
any more of Scott's stuff.

33:44.943 --> 33:47.516
Oh, but you gotta
take these Transformers.

33:47.697 --> 33:51.565
You kids used to play
with those by the hour.

33:51.743 --> 33:53.486
That's when we were 1 1 .

33:53.704 --> 33:55.696
Why are you acting
like we're still best friends?

33:55.873 --> 33:58.198
Oh, when two people were as close
as you and Scotty,

33:58.376 --> 34:01.662
- you stay friends forever.
- Oh, is that the way it works?

34:03.882 --> 34:08.840
Well, if you don't wanna help
keep his memory alive...

34:09.054 --> 34:11.178
l didn't say that.

34:11.391 --> 34:15.223
Oh, David, l'm so sorry.

34:17.313 --> 34:20.563
We're all experiencing your grief.

34:21.069 --> 34:24.853
But, David,
you mustn't be angry at Scott

34:25.407 --> 34:27.612
or feel like he's abandoned you.

34:27.827 --> 34:31.277
l don't. Look, Scott accidentally shot
himself in the stomach

34:31.498 --> 34:33.289
because he liked to play with guns.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.536
But l don't think that has
anything to do with me.

34:39.005 --> 34:44.214
Well, fine, then.
Take what you want and...

34:45.304 --> 34:49.219
- l'm gonna lie down.
- Mrs. Scanlon, just wait a minute.

34:49.393 --> 34:51.385
Mrs. Scanlon.

35:04.786 --> 35:06.825
Now, you have to remember,
in December of '4 1,

35:07.039 --> 35:09.494
there was a blackout in effect,
because everyone assumed

35:09.667 --> 35:12.075
that Japan's next target
would be Los Angeles.

35:12.295 --> 35:13.789
That's why the students
had to sneak--

35:13.964 --> 35:17.084
David, what are you
doing here so early?

35:18.052 --> 35:20.377
What does it look like l'm doing?

35:22.015 --> 35:23.723
Editing the video?

35:23.892 --> 35:25.635
Bingo.

35:27.271 --> 35:30.687
David, l hope you don't mind
my asking,

35:30.858 --> 35:32.518
are you all right?

35:32.777 --> 35:36.941
Sure, l'm just peachy keen,
hunky-dory, okay?

35:37.157 --> 35:39.233
Why are you being
so nasty to me?

35:39.410 --> 35:40.987
- l'm not a doormat, you know.
- Donna--

35:41.162 --> 35:43.201
No, half the time you ignore me,

35:43.373 --> 35:45.531
and the other half,
you just want to talk about Kelly.

35:45.751 --> 35:49.286
l mean, who stood by you and got
everyone to come to that party?

35:49.505 --> 35:51.332
And who made a point
of being at that funeral

35:51.507 --> 35:53.049
so you wouldn't have
to be there alone?

35:53.218 --> 35:55.887
Who talked to you when no one
else would give you the time of day?

35:57.431 --> 35:59.055
You did.

35:59.517 --> 36:02.886
Look, l'm sorry, okay?
l didn't realise.

36:03.521 --> 36:07.353
Look, l know you're going through
a really hard time right now.

36:07.901 --> 36:09.395
l'm just worried about you.

36:10.696 --> 36:15.821
Thanks, but the worst part's over.

36:15.994 --> 36:17.156
l just gotta move on.

36:19.039 --> 36:23.535
And speaking of moving on,
l've really gotta watch the rest of this.

36:24.462 --> 36:27.796
- l'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

36:27.966 --> 36:29.294
- Bye.
- Bye.

36:38.353 --> 36:40.227
David, good buddy,
what are you doing?

36:40.397 --> 36:41.725
Making a video?

36:41.899 --> 36:43.523
l'm doing man-on-the-street
interviews,

36:43.693 --> 36:46.362
and you look like
a man on the street.

36:46.529 --> 36:48.438
- Thank you.
- Or in the hallway, actually.

36:48.615 --> 36:54.784
The hallway. So, Scott, what were
you doing in 194 1?

36:55.957 --> 37:00.251
l was in Vietnam,
3rd lnfantry Marines.

37:00.421 --> 37:04.289
- Yeah.
- Scott, you have the wrong war.

37:04.467 --> 37:06.294
Well, we'll start again.

37:06.469 --> 37:07.797
l can get it right.

37:08.013 --> 37:09.804
You know what,
l've known you my whole life.

37:09.973 --> 37:12.381
- l don't think you'll ever get it right.
- ls that a fact?

37:12.560 --> 37:14.932
Yeah, that is so, that is so,
you know what, you know what?

37:15.104 --> 37:16.978
l love you for it, man.

37:17.190 --> 37:19.396
- Come on, we'll do this again.
- One more time.

37:19.568 --> 37:21.726
Man-on-the-street interviews,
take two.

37:21.904 --> 37:25.273
So, Scott, what were you doing
in 194 1?

37:25.450 --> 37:28.784
- l was in lwo Jima.
- lwo Jima?

37:28.954 --> 37:33.166
No, a punji stick in my leg
and it was crazy, man.

37:33.334 --> 37:35.125
l can still walk though.
No need to worry.

37:35.295 --> 37:40.337
Oh, that's good, that's good.
So in 194 1, he was in lwo Jima.

37:46.391 --> 37:49.807
- lt's a secret.
- Tell me.

37:50.687 --> 37:52.347
l'm gonna go
talk to Andrea for a second.

37:52.523 --> 37:53.768
Okay.

37:55.234 --> 37:58.151
Andrea. Andrea, listen.

37:59.573 --> 38:02.028
l feel bad that you feel bad.
What can l do?

38:02.952 --> 38:06.036
Nothing. Just be my friend.

38:06.956 --> 38:08.913
l am your friend.

38:09.626 --> 38:12.580
And l'm your editor,
and you promised me an interview.

38:12.755 --> 38:16.041
- That's exactly where l was headed.
- l need it in an hour, ace.

38:16.217 --> 38:17.841
You got it.

38:23.934 --> 38:26.555
Hey, David. Sorry l'm late.

38:28.898 --> 38:30.641
Timely song.

38:32.277 --> 38:34.353
Well, l'm glad you approve.

38:35.489 --> 38:36.983
Man, this isn't gonna take very long.

38:37.158 --> 38:39.234
l just need to ask you
a couple questions, okay?

38:39.619 --> 38:42.240
Look, Brandon, l don't think that l--

38:42.456 --> 38:45.492
David, l can't push this back anymore,
man. l'm on a serious deadline.

38:47.420 --> 38:48.962
Why don't you just make up
a few quotes

38:49.130 --> 38:51.336
so l won't offend anybody
by saying the wrong thing?

38:52.217 --> 38:54.375
Why don't you just tell me
something about Scott?

38:54.553 --> 38:57.507
Some memory, something that not
too many other people would know

38:57.682 --> 39:00.090
and we'll leave it at that?

39:01.061 --> 39:03.848
He sucked his thumb until he was 8.
ls that what you had in mind?

39:04.064 --> 39:06.851
Come on, David, we're putting out
this issue as a tribute to Scott.

39:07.068 --> 39:11.196
Why? So people can glance at it
and then throw it in the garbage?

39:11.531 --> 39:14.532
No, so people can get some kind
of an idea as to who he was.

39:14.743 --> 39:16.819
Look, he was a jerk, okay?

39:16.996 --> 39:19.534
He was a jerk who blew himself away,
that's who he was.

39:19.749 --> 39:21.623
You don't know, you left early.

39:21.835 --> 39:24.326
You missed out on the fun part
when he picked up a loaded gun

39:24.505 --> 39:26.129
and twirled it around
like Wyatt Earp.

39:27.175 --> 39:28.717
You weren't there
to see him goof up

39:28.927 --> 39:31.299
and shoot himself and bleed
all over his mom's Persian rug.

39:31.471 --> 39:32.799
David, the microphone is on.

39:33.682 --> 39:35.057
l don't care.

39:35.643 --> 39:38.312
No one gave a rat's ass
about Scott until he died.

39:38.521 --> 39:40.644
And l was the worst one of all.

39:40.815 --> 39:42.642
He was my best friend
and l dropped him.

39:42.859 --> 39:45.480
Because he wasn't cool
like you or Kelly or Steve.

39:46.197 --> 39:47.739
David.

39:52.037 --> 39:54.824
So they're looking at me. So what?

39:55.040 --> 39:58.160
They've been looking at me
for days, Brandon.

39:58.628 --> 40:01.997
''Oh, poor David. ls he gonna be okay?
l hope he hasn't cracked up yet.''

40:02.215 --> 40:04.706
l can't even walk through the hall
without somebody in my face

40:04.885 --> 40:07.091
trying to cheer me up
like they're my new best friend.

40:07.305 --> 40:10.010
Well, what about my old best friend?

40:26.201 --> 40:28.988
lt doesn't matter what you write
about him in the paper, Brandon.

40:29.580 --> 40:32.201
lt doesn't matter what you say
about somebody once they're gone.

40:32.751 --> 40:35.586
What matters is how you treat them
when they're still here.

40:43.180 --> 40:45.219
l guess you can quote me on that.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.786
That took a lot of courage, David.

41:05.956 --> 41:08.162
So does anyone else
wanna interview me?

41:08.334 --> 41:09.911
Listen, David, do yourself a favour.

41:10.086 --> 41:12.755
Next time somebody asks you
how you're feeling, tell them.

41:13.131 --> 41:15.918
Yeah. You can be honest.
We'll still be your friends.

41:17.219 --> 41:18.927
Well, thanks.

41:19.680 --> 41:21.672
But when do l get
to start feeling better?

41:21.891 --> 41:24.678
lt might take a while, David.
lt happened so suddenly.

41:24.853 --> 41:26.929
You can never be prepared
for an accident like that.

41:27.481 --> 41:29.853
Especially when you don't even get
to say goodbye.

41:31.361 --> 41:33.934
Well, it's too late for that now.

41:34.781 --> 41:36.608
Maybe not.

41:36.784 --> 41:38.693
l have an idea.

41:41.956 --> 41:43.284
David.

41:45.293 --> 41:48.413
Here's the videocassette
l promised you.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.630
You may not wanna watch it
right away

41:50.800 --> 41:54.465
but l'm sure one day,
you'll be happy to have it.

41:55.222 --> 41:56.680
Thank you.

41:58.350 --> 42:00.722
Are you sure you don't wanna
come in for a minute?

42:01.229 --> 42:04.265
Oh, no, l'll come by another day
and visit Spencer and everybody.

42:04.441 --> 42:07.062
But tonight l'm doing something
kind of special.

42:08.487 --> 42:12.152
Wait a minute. You don't wanna forget
what you came for.

42:16.371 --> 42:18.577
l know that Scott
would be really pleased

42:18.749 --> 42:20.409
that you wanted to have that.

42:25.340 --> 42:28.127
Come on, you guys,
are you almost done?

42:28.302 --> 42:30.341
Why couldn't we do this
by the light of day?

42:30.554 --> 42:32.593
Yeah, it's practically a ritual now.

42:32.765 --> 42:34.757
Every 50 years, someone's
gotta break onto campus

42:34.934 --> 42:36.511
and plant a time capsule.

42:36.728 --> 42:39.764
Yeah, but how do you know someone's
gonna be here in 50 years to dig it up?

42:39.940 --> 42:41.351
Well, time will tell.

42:41.567 --> 42:44.484
Okay, we've got books,
CD's, magazines.

42:44.654 --> 42:47.192
All that's left is personal touches.

42:48.116 --> 42:52.328
Okay. Well, this is the Scott Scanlon
memorial time capsule,

42:52.497 --> 42:55.700
so l brought along a copy of our
special edition on recycled paper

42:55.875 --> 42:57.749
and a copy on floppy disk,

42:57.920 --> 43:02.915
which undoubtedly will be considered
a primitive artefact in 50 years.

43:04.719 --> 43:08.669
Well, here's my comment
on today's technology.

43:08.849 --> 43:09.880
A Corvette key chain.

43:11.644 --> 43:13.553
Oh, so, what'd you bring,
Donna? Cloth?

43:13.771 --> 43:18.729
No, in the '40s they had nylon.
ln the '90s, we had lycra spandex.

43:19.862 --> 43:21.356
Well, l brought a very cool T-shirt

43:21.530 --> 43:23.855
in honour of the great
Minnesota Twins

43:24.033 --> 43:27.153
for very obvious reasons, l think.

43:27.496 --> 43:28.990
So, what'd you bring, D?

43:29.456 --> 43:33.584
Surfboard wax to symbolise the waves
that have been pounding the shores

43:33.753 --> 43:37.667
for thousands of years, but really,
it's just a brief moment in time.

43:40.970 --> 43:42.844
That leaves you, David.

44:14.008 --> 44:18.670
Well, there's only one thing left.

44:40.288 --> 44:43.324
Look, you guys,
it's just like the Fourth of July.

44:44.418 --> 44:46.660
This one's for you, Scott.

44:47.305 --> 44:53.359
