01:35.053 --> 01:37.179
What do we do when we
use the bathroom, Bob?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.725
We lift the lid.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.060
I did.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.104
You're disgusting.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.995
Chew with your mouth closed.

02:03.623 --> 02:07.292
Really, Pauline, I raised
you better than that.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.554
Yes, you may be excused.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.561
Thank goodness I have you.

02:25.728 --> 02:28.272
Hm.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.488
Much has changed
since I was an adolescent.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.117
The function of reproductive
organs, however, has not.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.786
Now before we get side-tracked
looking at pictures of penises,

02:42.954 --> 02:44.913
I want to have
a frank discussion

02:45.081 --> 02:47.708
on the issue
of sexual transmitted diseases.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.170
One in two
sexually active teenagers

02:51.337 --> 02:53.213
will contract an STD
by the age of 25.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.132
What do you think about that?
Yeah, Pauline?

02:55.300 --> 02:59.011
Can you contract an STD from
having sex with a dead person?

03:07.187 --> 03:09.688
Any real questions
in this audience?

03:09.856 --> 03:11.064
Yeah?

03:11.232 --> 03:13.108
If a mosquito bites you
that has AIDS...

03:13.276 --> 03:15.819
No, I mean,
it would be one thing

03:15.987 --> 03:18.197
if he was like muscular
and a ginger.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.449
But he's scrawny and a ging
and it just doesn't work.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.201
Oh, my God, you're so mean.
I think he's cute.

03:25.496 --> 03:29.166
Okay, so last night Adam
could not get hard

03:29.334 --> 03:33.003
- and it was like totally awkward.
- It's never stopped me.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.714
Okay, tell me the truth.
Is it this?

03:35.882 --> 03:38.592
Like--

03:38.760 --> 03:40.177
Please don't do that.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.138
- Is it? Just tell me the truth.
- No.

03:43.306 --> 03:46.350
Kind of.

03:46.517 --> 03:49.269
- Maybe he's gay.
- No.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.521
Hey.
What did I miss?

03:51.689 --> 03:52.689
Hey, nothing.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.025
Your girlfriend's friend
thinks you're gay.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.861
Excuse me?

03:58.029 --> 04:00.864
You're not pretty enough.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.746
Buckle up.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.708
I'm your mother,
it's my job and it's the law.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.421
Buckle your seatbelt!

04:16.589 --> 04:18.548
We're not going any further
until you do.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.219
Thank you.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.681
If you want to be treated as an adult,
you need to start acting like one.

04:25.848 --> 04:29.559
I don't understand why you insist
on playing these childish games?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.399
Tell me about your day.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.734
I'd rather not.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.779
Tell me two things about your day
or I'm gonna hit the truth horn.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.656
Fuck the truth horn.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.578
All right, enough!

04:50.915 --> 04:53.917
I learned about the Civil War

04:54.085 --> 04:57.462
and sexually
transmitted diseases.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.339
Lovely.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.674
I guess we better get going.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.343
We don't want to be late
for your appointment.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.928
You could you at least
have the decency

05:05.096 --> 05:07.139
to take me to an actual
psychiatrist.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.099
Your father and I are
not made out of money.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.435
Reverend William
is a very bright man.

05:11.602 --> 05:14.688
You're Iucky to have him.
He's doing you a real favor.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.568
What's the matter, Pauline?

05:22.864 --> 05:25.157
What's the church's stance
on organ donations?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.658
Well, it's a touchy subject.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.453
Here we believe the body
is a temple.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.415
And what if I told you I found
the resting place

05:33.583 --> 05:35.792
of Jesus Christ
in my backyard

05:35.960 --> 05:39.129
and that with just a few advances
in science and technology

05:39.297 --> 05:41.715
I could resurrect him myself?

05:41.883 --> 05:44.718
I'd say that you are a very
troubled Iittle girl.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.805
I only want you to endure
the same gut-wrenching agony

05:48.973 --> 05:50.932
during these sessions
that I go through

05:51.100 --> 05:54.144
every single Sunday listening
to your sermons.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.321
Thank you!

06:13.998 --> 06:15.791
I know I don't believe in you.

06:15.958 --> 06:19.336
So you're totally justified
if you choose to ignore me.

06:19.504 --> 06:23.423
I just-- I've been meaning
to get something off my chest.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.802
I haven't read your book
in its entirety.

06:26.969 --> 06:30.347
Just can't bring myself to invest that
much time into a work of Iiterature

06:30.515 --> 06:32.432
that's received so many
mixed reviews.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.226
I'm an avid reader.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.771
There's just so much
stuff out there.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.815
Okay, here goes.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.567
I'm planning on having
premarital sex.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.487
I know you're not gonna
be 100 % onboard with it.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.782
Which is why I was wondering
if we could discuss

06:48.950 --> 06:50.617
your rules surrounding
forgiveness.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.869
I'm under the impression
if I ask you to forgive me,

06:53.037 --> 06:55.205
you kind of have to.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.792
Which is pretty awesome,
I just got to say.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.878
If I'm off-base, let me know.

07:02.046 --> 07:05.674
Otherwise, I'm gonna move
forward as planned.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.467
Amen.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.996
Something the matter, Pauline?

07:37.081 --> 07:38.498
I'm done.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.834
Are you quite sure?

07:41.002 --> 07:43.253
Quite.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.006
Some of these equations here,

07:46.174 --> 07:48.592
they don't seem to be completed.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.555
That's probably because my ability
to solve these equations

07:53.723 --> 07:56.725
has absolutely no bearing
on my future as a surgeon.

07:57.935 --> 08:00.312
Ah, a surgeon, of course.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.107
You know, mathematics and surgery,
they go hand in hand.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.277
I mean, if a patient's life
is at stake,

08:07.445 --> 08:10.322
there's no room for error.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.745
Get it done.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.624
It's such a lovely lapel pin.

08:20.791 --> 08:24.127
You must tell me
where you came across it.

08:28.966 --> 08:32.385
Sweetheart,
don't be confusing.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.471
You know I can't
understand a thing

08:34.639 --> 08:37.182
when you start waving
your hands around like that.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.808
Mom?

08:38.976 --> 08:41.645
Pauline?
What a wonderful surprise.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.395
What the fuck
are you doing here?

08:43.563 --> 08:46.733
Don't make me wash
your mouth out with soap.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.322
Why do you have this?

08:52.490 --> 08:54.950
We were just talking
about Cotillion.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.327
You're trying to ruin my life.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.679
Teenagers.

09:28.192 --> 09:31.486
Mother, I'd like to talk to you about
why you were at school today.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.448
What about it?

09:35.616 --> 09:38.618
You do realize I'm too old
for Cotillion class?

09:39.620 --> 09:41.871
Mrs. Guthrie has decided
to open her doors

09:42.039 --> 09:43.999
to a wider age range this year.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.959
She's a dear friend
in dire need of assistance.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.712
So I've decided to take
on a position as chaperone.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.256
You can't be serious.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.425
No daughter of mine
is going off to college

09:53.593 --> 09:57.053
without knowing the ins and outs
of what it's like to be a proper lady.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.055
I can't wait for Cotillion.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.767
And what do you have to say
about all this?

10:07.982 --> 10:09.899
I think what your mother
is trying to do is--

10:10.067 --> 10:12.485
Your mother?
Excuse me.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.404
This was our decision.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.740
I knew Dad had nothing
to do with it.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.451
You don't even have enough backbone
to stand up for your own wife?

10:19.619 --> 10:20.827
You're repulsive.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.288
Make sure Grace takes her pills.

10:24.540 --> 10:27.917
Un-fucking believable.
Sorry.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.105
That's complete bullshit.
It's not gonna happen.

11:30.272 --> 11:31.481
Happened to my sister.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.985
I don't think we've been
formally introduced.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.196
I'm Pauline.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.075
I'm Adam.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.834
Forgive me for being too
forward, but...

11:53.170 --> 11:55.213
I want to Iose
my virginity to you.

11:57.842 --> 12:01.928
I'm clean and I spent my
allowances on birth control, so...

12:02.096 --> 12:04.264
That's nice.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.352
Adam.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.356
It's my number.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.820
Call me.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.781
- You're on the top of my list.
- Thank you.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.409
I won't wait forever.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.299
I'm ready to lose my virginity.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.051
It's a common misconception

12:42.219 --> 12:45.263
that having intercourse during
menstruation is unhealthy.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.227
When I lose my virginity,

12:51.395 --> 12:54.731
I want to be on my period.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.068
Girls, we're having
early dinner.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.072
I'm not hungry.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.909
Come, Pauline.
Look at you.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.462
I thought you were on a diet.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.423
I'm not gonna keep cooking you
special meals

13:20.591 --> 13:22.550
if you're gonna gorge
yourself on ice cream.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.803
Honey, it's the weekend!

13:43.113 --> 13:46.533
You're my heart,
you know that, don't you?

13:46.700 --> 13:48.618
I saw Charlotte wearing
a dress just like this one.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.370
Who is Charlotte?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.664
She's the most popular
girl I know.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.792
She only dates older boys.

13:57.044 --> 14:00.797
Stay away from Charlotte.
She sounds trashy.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.216
No, she's not.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.468
She only dresses like she is.

15:28.594 --> 15:32.221
Sweetheart, you've got a bit
of something on your nose.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.391
I know, it's a piercing.
I did it last night.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.144
You ruined your face?

15:38.312 --> 15:39.646
Did you sterilize the needle?

15:39.813 --> 15:41.314
What if it gets infected?

15:41.482 --> 15:43.483
I used antiseptic.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.069
You know, I pierced a few things
when I was younger, too.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.076
You look like trash.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.619
Get over it.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.247
You are not going out of this house
with that thing in your nose.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.418
Look what you've done
to your mother.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.420
Now you take that thing
out right now.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.101
Bob, be honest.
Am I being too hard on Pauline?

16:18.268 --> 16:21.020
You both have your moments.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.022
I'm not becoming
my mother, am I?

16:23.190 --> 16:25.942
Honey, if you were
becoming your mother

16:26.110 --> 16:29.612
I wouldn't be filing bills right now,
I'd be filing for a divorce.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.120
Not now.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.383
It's just like Mom to make me
take out my nose piercing.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.552
You saw it this morning, right?

16:52.720 --> 16:54.721
The procedure was a success.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.557
I'm telling you, Grace,
these hands are gifted.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.809
Martin broke up with me.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.811
Who's Martin?

17:01.979 --> 17:03.521
My Internet boyfriend.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.692
You'll move on.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.986
Men are pigs.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.625
That looks like fun!

17:26.545 --> 17:29.338
I haven't jumped rope
since lower school.

17:29.506 --> 17:32.216
I'm flat-footed,
it's bad for my knees.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.635
Okay?

17:37.222 --> 17:40.099
I could just get insoles.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.226
Maybe we could jump rope
some time.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.771
I don't think so.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.444
Hey! Don't be mean
to my sister!

17:54.364 --> 17:55.740
Come on, Pauline.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.178
- Who is this?
- Uh, it's Adam, from school.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.971
It's late, Adam, what is it?

18:19.139 --> 18:20.389
I want to take you up
on your offer.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.517
I have a car and a fake ID.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.268
You know, we could get like
a hotel room or something.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.020
Pick me up Monday at noon.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.563
Teacher work day?

18:27.731 --> 18:31.234
That's right, Adam,
teacher work day.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.277
I'll tell my mother
we're in a study group.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.904
Okay, good.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.906
So, uh--

19:02.182 --> 19:05.935
Dear God, one thing
I've been thinking about.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.938
The whole thing about relatives
watching over you after they die

19:09.106 --> 19:11.274
really rubs me the wrong way.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.526
I do a lot of crazy shit
while I'm alone

19:13.694 --> 19:15.862
and I'd appreciate
some privacy.

19:17.281 --> 19:20.158
I don't want to sound
presumptuous.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.201
But if I do get into heaven

19:22.369 --> 19:24.579
and my relatives have been
watching over me,

19:24.746 --> 19:29.167
a lot of relationships will
have been compromised.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.711
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

19:31.879 --> 19:34.172
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

20:29.770 --> 20:32.146
They have canoeing.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.068
What's all this?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.528
We're sending your sister
to CF camp.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.739
- What did she do?
- Cute.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.200
Last summer, Gracie had the
time of her Iife at CF camp,

20:44.368 --> 20:45.451
didn't you, honey?

20:45.619 --> 20:47.119
Everyone has the disorder,
so I fit right in.

20:47.287 --> 20:51.290
Mom, a boy named Adam is gonna
pick me up around noon.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.875
He's put together a study group,

20:53.043 --> 20:56.379
because we have a really
big test next week.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.714
I'll only be gone a few hours.

21:01.551 --> 21:04.220
This boy in your study group
must be something.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.888
How'd you meet?

21:06.056 --> 21:08.391
Just get this over with.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.454
So, um--

22:11.621 --> 22:13.539
It's okay.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.875
This will be our little secret.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.838
I, uh...

22:21.006 --> 22:23.341
stole some condoms
from my brother's room.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.427
They're the big kind.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.849
Take off your pants.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.836
It appears you're too small
for the big kind.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.177
But that's not a bad thing.

23:08.345 --> 23:11.389
It's just--

23:11.556 --> 23:14.850
it'll hurt less, so it's good.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.479
Um...

23:19.523 --> 23:21.899
we'll forget the condoms.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.026
Like I said,
I'm on birth control

23:24.194 --> 23:27.696
and that is over
99 % effective, so...

23:30.534 --> 23:33.369
Okay, yeah.

23:41.711 --> 23:44.380
Take off your clothes, Adam.

24:10.615 --> 24:13.075
God, you're so fucking wet.

25:09.132 --> 25:11.509
I want you to go down on me.

25:11.676 --> 25:13.469
Okay.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.955
What the fuck?

25:53.009 --> 25:54.927
Thank you, Adam.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.724
I had a really nice time.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.693
Can you get the fuck
off my car?

26:27.210 --> 26:29.211
How did it go?

26:35.093 --> 26:37.469
It was everything
I'd hoped it would be.

26:39.055 --> 26:42.683
Good. I'm so glad.

26:43.852 --> 26:47.396
First things first.
I don't want to be pregnant.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.064
I know I was on my period

26:49.232 --> 26:51.483
and that pretty much takes
care of that,

26:51.651 --> 26:53.944
but I'm still a little paranoid.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.656
In any case, if I am pregnant,
I'm just gonna have an abortion.

26:57.824 --> 27:00.075
Apparently, you don't approve
of abortion,

27:00.243 --> 27:02.620
so save us both the trouble.

27:58.259 --> 28:00.135
It's okay.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.642
She's with the angels.

28:08.144 --> 28:10.270
I know.

28:18.196 --> 28:22.032
You know what the worst thing
is about having cystic fibrosis?

28:22.200 --> 28:24.493
What's that, sweetheart?

28:24.661 --> 28:26.245
When your friends die.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.421
Last night we found out
Grace's best friend

28:35.588 --> 28:37.756
from CF camp passed away.

28:39.050 --> 28:43.137
Please make a special effort to be nice
to her while she mourns the Ioss.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.139
Where is she?

28:45.306 --> 28:47.266
She had a doctor's appointment.

28:49.769 --> 28:53.105
She's gonna need a lung
transplant, isn't she?

28:53.273 --> 28:55.524
You've been
doing your homework.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.943
It's a very serious procedure.

28:58.111 --> 29:01.697
There's a high risk
of infection.

29:01.865 --> 29:05.534
With all the mishaps that happen
in hospitals these days,

29:05.702 --> 29:08.912
perhaps you should consider
an alternative.

29:10.874 --> 29:15.002
That day is a Iong ways
down the road, Pauline.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.092
All right, next question.
Let's see.

29:22.260 --> 29:25.220
Somebody asked,

29:25.388 --> 29:29.224
"Is it true that being fat results
in poor sperm quality?

29:29.392 --> 29:32.352
And if so, do you have to use
protection while having sex?"

29:32.520 --> 29:36.690
Yes, fact: being overweight does
affect your sperm quality.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.901
What the hell are you doing?

29:39.068 --> 29:41.528
You're gonna set off
the fucking fire alarm.

29:43.406 --> 29:45.240
I lost my virginity yesterday.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.576
Checking myself for STDs.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.746
You are such a freak.
Who would sleep with you?

29:50.914 --> 29:53.916
"Mr. Claybaugh,
does it mean that you're gay

29:54.083 --> 29:55.626
since you try to suck your
own dick all the time?"

29:55.794 --> 29:57.753
Who asked this question?

29:57.921 --> 30:00.088
Anybody know who wrote this?

30:00.256 --> 30:01.757
If somebody could tell me
who wrote this question...

30:01.925 --> 30:03.967
You're an idiot. Do you really think
that you're gonna be able to tell

30:04.135 --> 30:06.428
if you have an STD
by looking at your blood?

30:06.596 --> 30:09.097
It's just one of those things.

30:11.434 --> 30:14.436
Brachiosaurus thing.
Weird. I don't know.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.149
- Sorry.
- Hello, Adam.

30:19.317 --> 30:22.027
Hey, what are you doing here?

30:25.240 --> 30:27.157
I'd watch out for Pauline,
if I were you.

30:27.325 --> 30:30.160
She gave herself an STD test
in science class today.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.789
Everything was fine, but you
can never be too careful.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.707
Oh, Natalie, I meant to ask you,

30:35.875 --> 30:37.918
do you have any STDs?

30:38.086 --> 30:39.753
Absolutely not.

30:41.422 --> 30:44.132
Good, then neither do I.

30:48.221 --> 30:51.014
- What is she talking about?
- I have no idea.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.183
How was school today?

30:53.351 --> 30:55.310
Dreadful.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.938
Things not going well
with your friend?

30:58.106 --> 30:59.273
What friend?

30:59.440 --> 31:01.942
The boy from the study group.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.278
Adam?

31:04.445 --> 31:07.531
He was tolerable,
but I've lost interest.

31:09.909 --> 31:11.159
Well, that's a shame.

31:11.327 --> 31:14.329
He seemed
like such a nice young man.

31:15.331 --> 31:17.666
First off, this will
be our last session.

31:17.834 --> 31:21.670
You are completely unqualified
to be doing this. It's unethical.

31:21.838 --> 31:24.548
I have it on the highest
authority that you're wrong.

31:24.716 --> 31:28.093
I refuse to allow you to indulge
in my psycho-sexual fantasies.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.178
I would imagine a man
as repressed as yourself

31:30.346 --> 31:32.723
would have his own
issues to work out.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.058
I'm here to listen, not judge.

31:35.226 --> 31:38.061
Psychiatry is a science.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.939
At least in some circles anyway.

31:41.107 --> 31:43.525
If there's one thing I know,

31:43.693 --> 31:47.195
it's that science
and religion don't mix.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.702
So, that's it then?

31:53.870 --> 31:56.163
That's it.

32:10.136 --> 32:12.846
Dear God, in regards to my sister,

32:13.014 --> 32:15.682
while I might not show
it all the time,

32:15.850 --> 32:18.268
I love her.

32:18.436 --> 32:22.064
Please allow me to do everything
in my power to cure her.

32:24.150 --> 32:26.735
And lastly, my mother.

32:26.903 --> 32:29.071
Kill her.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.657
Kill her before
she can make me attend

32:31.824 --> 32:35.452
those horrible
Cotillion classes.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.412
You'll probably want
to make it painless.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.164
I get it, that's your thing.

32:39.332 --> 32:41.249
But hear me out.

32:41.417 --> 32:45.045
A little pain never hurt anyone.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.756
Besides, you can always
just blame it on the devil.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.176
And what have we here?

32:51.344 --> 32:54.346
My jump rope club's raising money
to benefit inner-city youth.

32:54.514 --> 32:57.975
How wonderful.
Step inside.

33:07.485 --> 33:10.237
- What are you doing here?
- None of your business.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.030
You weren't very nice
to me the other day.

33:12.198 --> 33:13.949
You're weird.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.456
Come here again and I will
perform a tracheotomy on you

33:21.624 --> 33:24.042
with the blunt end of one
of yourjump ropes.

33:30.758 --> 33:33.260
God loves you.

33:34.262 --> 33:35.721
Thank you.

33:53.322 --> 33:54.364
What's so funny?

33:54.532 --> 33:58.326
Do you purposely leave your house
looking like a raging lesbian?

33:58.494 --> 34:00.829
You do have the body
of a 10-year-old boy.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.290
That's a highly
unfortunate opinion.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.333
Especially considering
your vagina

34:05.501 --> 34:07.377
looks like
a diseased ax wound.

34:07.545 --> 34:08.837
That's vile.

34:09.005 --> 34:12.215
I actually get afraid that
I might get a yeast infection

34:12.382 --> 34:14.760
just being in the same room
with that thing.

34:14.927 --> 34:17.137
Look, I spoke with Adam.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.056
And I got to hand it to you,
from the sounds of it,

34:19.223 --> 34:21.266
he's freakier than I imagined.

34:21.434 --> 34:24.393
So I dumped him.
He's all yours.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.438
Forgive my vulgarity,

34:26.606 --> 34:30.484
but Adam licks pussy
like a dog drinks water.

34:30.650 --> 34:32.069
I'm not interested.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.112
Suit yourself.

34:35.281 --> 34:37.866
You mind if I leave you
with some advice?

34:38.034 --> 34:40.034
Make it quick,
I got to take a shit.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.205
You're disgusting.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.793
Stop spending your
allowance on birth control

34:48.960 --> 34:52.297
and invest in some estrogen
pills, okay?

35:07.605 --> 35:12.025
♪ My bones fall in ♪

35:12.193 --> 35:16.071
♪ My bones fall out ♪

35:16.239 --> 35:20.367
♪ You're cool as silk ♪

35:20.535 --> 35:24.412
♪ Beside my heart... ♪

35:25.581 --> 35:27.916
What are you doing?

35:28.084 --> 35:31.002
I'm thinking of performing
an umbilical plasty on myself.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.671
What's that?

35:32.839 --> 35:34.923
Long story short,

35:35.091 --> 35:38.593
I want to reshape my navel
and allowance won't cover it.

35:38.761 --> 35:41.012
What do you think?

35:41.180 --> 35:44.266
Boys don't care
about belly buttons.

35:44.433 --> 35:46.268
They care about these.

35:47.770 --> 35:52.149
My world does not revolve around
boys like yours does, Grace.

35:52.316 --> 35:55.110
I'm doing this for myself.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.464
Come on.

36:16.632 --> 36:19.426
Breathe, Pauline.
Good girl.

36:19.594 --> 36:22.387
Bob, you have a cold sore
on your lip!

36:22.555 --> 36:24.055
You should have waited
for the lifeguard.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.640
Are you serious?
She could have died.

36:25.808 --> 36:26.975
Well, when she's a teenager,

36:27.143 --> 36:29.311
you get to explain to her why
she has herpes on her lip.

36:29.478 --> 36:30.979
Unbelievable.

36:31.147 --> 36:33.190
Pauline, what did I tell you?

36:33.357 --> 36:35.525
The high dive is for big girls.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.824
I can cut it myself.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.163
I have some exciting news.

36:48.331 --> 36:52.334
Today, I bought Pauline
the most elegant dress.

36:52.501 --> 36:55.420
Perfect for both church
and Cotillion.

36:56.505 --> 36:59.049
You won't let it rest,
will you?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.343
I refuse to go to church.

37:01.510 --> 37:04.429
Isn't it enough that I'm willing
to subject myself to the humiliation

37:04.597 --> 37:06.514
of Cotillion with a bunch
of adolescents?

37:06.682 --> 37:09.643
Well, Cotillion will help
you land a decent husband.

37:09.810 --> 37:12.354
I'm gonna get married one day.

37:12.521 --> 37:14.064
To a black guy.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.690
Well, don't expect
for him to be faithful.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.526
African-Americans
are notorious adulterers.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.614
Don't look at me
like that, Bob.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.158
Well, they are.

37:32.541 --> 37:35.669
Tomorrow night is gonna be over
before you know it.

37:35.836 --> 37:38.046
Pauline,

37:38.214 --> 37:40.590
you're gonna look beautiful.

37:42.927 --> 37:45.595
I know I can be a bit of
a demented bitch sometimes.

37:48.724 --> 37:51.643
But you still love me, right?

37:51.811 --> 37:54.312
Of course, I do.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.648
Oh, God, you're getting
a cold sore.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.733
Jesus, Mom, show some tact.

37:58.901 --> 38:01.528
It's okay.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.739
We just won't do the pictures.

38:20.881 --> 38:22.173
What's the occasion?

38:22.341 --> 38:24.551
Well, I was so excited about
tonight, I couldn't sleep.

38:24.719 --> 38:27.804
So I decided I might as well
get started in the kitchen.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.431
Bacon. Nice.

38:29.598 --> 38:33.560
Maybe if I eat enough I can
induce a coronary.

38:35.604 --> 38:38.523
Hey, Dad? Thanks.

38:40.526 --> 38:43.028
You're welcome.
I saved your life.

38:44.655 --> 38:47.282
On the off-chance that I have
another near-death experience

38:47.450 --> 38:49.409
and you're the only one around,

38:49.577 --> 38:52.454
what new sexually transmitted
disease can I expect to acquire?

38:53.581 --> 38:57.709
I will be down in 10 minutes.
Please be ready to go.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.462
Come upstairs when you're
through with your breakfast.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.549
Dad?

39:04.717 --> 39:06.885
I don't want to hear it.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.360
Young lady?

39:25.654 --> 39:28.323
- Principal Campbell.
- Mm-hmm.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.116
Save some for the rest of us.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.745
AII right?

39:47.676 --> 39:50.678
Ew, don't sit next to me.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.597
Where's your friend Natalie?

39:52.765 --> 39:54.682
None of your business.

39:57.019 --> 39:58.770
Yes, Pauline?

39:58.938 --> 40:00.563
I have to go to the bathroom.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.982
Do you have any
hall passes left?

40:03.150 --> 40:04.609
No.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.861
Oh, well, I'm sorry,

40:07.029 --> 40:10.240
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to wait until the bell rings.

40:11.909 --> 40:14.619
Anyone here like to take a shot

40:14.787 --> 40:17.872
at explaining
Cramer's Rule to the class?

40:18.040 --> 40:19.374
Anyone?

40:21.043 --> 40:22.585
Abigail.

40:22.753 --> 40:25.880
It's a formula for solving systems

40:26.048 --> 40:28.675
of equations by determinants.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.635
Yes, correct.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.347
Yes, Pauline?

40:34.515 --> 40:37.434
I have to go to the bathroom.

40:37.601 --> 40:40.812
All right, make it quick.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.898
And don't make me regret this.

41:08.048 --> 41:09.841
Oh!

41:10.009 --> 41:11.801
Congratulations!

41:11.969 --> 41:13.928
You've now Iost
your bathroom privileges

41:14.096 --> 41:15.930
to the end of the semester.

41:16.098 --> 41:17.932
Was I really gone that long?

41:18.100 --> 41:20.435
Just take out
your text book, page 73.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.604
See if you can catch up
with the rest of the class.

41:22.771 --> 41:26.608
And if you have any questions,
you know where I am.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.864
What is it now, Pauline?

41:33.032 --> 41:35.241
I feel sick,
may I go to the clinic?

41:35.409 --> 41:37.952
Tough it out.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.456
In another 10 minutes, you'll be
somebody else's problem.

41:46.462 --> 41:49.005
You are so full of shit.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.977
Mr. Cooper?

42:03.145 --> 42:05.271
I think I'm gonna be sick.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.245
Oh!

42:21.872 --> 42:23.831
Oh, that's disgusting.

42:24.917 --> 42:28.336
Well, your temperature's normal.

42:28.504 --> 42:31.714
Maybe you have food poisoning.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.967
Maybe.

42:34.134 --> 42:36.177
There's a multitude
of bacterial infections

42:36.345 --> 42:38.096
I'm not willing to rule out.

42:42.518 --> 42:45.895
Let's not forget to sanitize that.
It is my favorite thermometer.

42:47.022 --> 42:48.982
I'm very disappointed in you.

42:49.149 --> 42:50.400
For what?

42:50.568 --> 42:52.569
When your school called,

42:52.736 --> 42:55.989
my first inclination was to
check the medicine chest.

42:56.156 --> 42:58.700
A touch unsympathetic, I know.

42:58.867 --> 43:02.620
But I have a pretty good grasp
of how your mind works.

43:02.788 --> 43:04.747
That's when I discovered
that the ipecac syrup

43:04.915 --> 43:07.208
had mysteriously disappeared.

43:08.877 --> 43:12.088
That's impressive
detective work, Mother.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.716
Pretending that you're sick?

43:14.883 --> 43:17.844
It's an all-time low, Pauline.

43:18.012 --> 43:21.139
Your sister would do anything
for a healthy body

43:21.307 --> 43:22.724
and you take it so for granted.

43:22.891 --> 43:24.726
Relax.

43:24.893 --> 43:27.895
It's not Iike I have
Munchausen Syndrome.

43:28.063 --> 43:30.690
It was a last ditch effort
to get out of Cotillion.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.693
That's all.

43:33.861 --> 43:36.321
Well, it didn't work.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.961
You look beautiful.

43:53.047 --> 43:55.423
We're gonna have to beat
the boys off with a stick.

43:55.591 --> 43:56.799
Gross.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.636
Agh, back off!

43:59.803 --> 44:01.971
Good Iord, Pauline!
You just had something on your face.

44:02.139 --> 44:06.100
The average human mouth contains
nearly 600 species of bacteria.

44:06.268 --> 44:08.770
My cheek might as well
be a Petri dish.

44:08.937 --> 44:10.772
When did you become
so germaphobic?

44:10.939 --> 44:13.441
I thought you wanted me to make
a good impression, right?

44:13.609 --> 44:16.819
In the unlikely event that someone
shows up with a microscope

44:16.987 --> 44:19.697
you can blame me, okay?

44:22.034 --> 44:23.660
Stand up straight.

44:26.288 --> 44:27.789
Better.

44:36.632 --> 44:40.259
Mother, this is bizarre.

44:42.221 --> 44:44.806
I didn't take the age difference
into consideration

44:44.973 --> 44:47.975
as much as I should have.
For that I apologize.

44:50.979 --> 44:54.148
Try and make the best of things.

45:14.670 --> 45:17.839
You okay?

45:18.006 --> 45:21.676
I'd rather be at home
with a good book.

45:24.847 --> 45:29.392
Well, that makes two of us.

45:30.853 --> 45:32.437
What do you think boys see

45:32.604 --> 45:35.523
in all these overly made-up
cum dumpsters?

45:37.192 --> 45:38.943
I wouldn't know.

45:39.111 --> 45:42.739
Boys don't talk to me unless
they need help with their homework.

45:53.083 --> 45:55.251
Have you ever thought
about having work done?

46:05.804 --> 46:07.722
Want to dance?

46:13.353 --> 46:15.897
So, how old are you?

46:16.064 --> 46:17.315
18.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.901
That's pretty old.

46:20.068 --> 46:21.861
Not really.

46:22.905 --> 46:24.947
Grace Marie!

46:25.115 --> 46:27.784
What on earth
has gotten into you?

46:27.951 --> 46:29.368
I'm vulnerable right now.

46:29.536 --> 46:33.414
Young Iady, you just Iost your
computer privileges permanently.

46:37.961 --> 46:40.755
Amber, I'm really sorry,
but this is not working out.

46:40.923 --> 46:43.716
I think I'm gonna have to pull
the girls from Cotillion.

46:43.884 --> 46:47.136
What's--
what's that on your lip?

46:47.304 --> 46:48.888
It's a cold sore.

46:49.056 --> 46:50.973
It's pretty disgusting.

46:51.141 --> 46:53.893
Oh, well, thanks.

46:54.061 --> 46:55.812
Sorry.

47:08.325 --> 47:09.325
What happened?

47:09.493 --> 47:11.619
The girl with herpes
on her face kissed me.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.830
Does that mean I'm gonna have
herpes on my face, too?

47:13.997 --> 47:15.331
Not necessarily.

47:15.499 --> 47:18.292
I asked her to dance.
I thought she was a retard.

47:18.460 --> 47:19.669
I was just trying to be nice.

47:19.837 --> 47:21.170
Pauline, how could you?

47:21.338 --> 47:24.340
It's pretty
self-explanatory, Mother.

47:24.508 --> 47:27.510
I fell victim to his charm.

I get a concerned call from
Principal Campbell

49:19.247 --> 49:20.998
that you didn't show up
for school today.

49:21.166 --> 49:25.127
And you expect me to believe
that you were at the library?

50:07.170 --> 50:09.755
You saw her at dinner.
She's disturbed.

50:09.923 --> 50:12.508
- I want her out of this house.
- She's a teenager.

50:12.676 --> 50:14.343
Bob, don't you
dare take her side!

50:14.511 --> 50:16.846
I will divorce your ass so fast,
you won't see it coming!

50:17.014 --> 50:19.140
- Come on, don't be--
- Bob, she's a fucking menace!

50:19.307 --> 50:21.684
No wonder all of her friends
have fallen by the wayside.

50:21.852 --> 50:24.020
You have to be fucking crazy
to want to spend time with her.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.855
I have tried and tried!

52:28.895 --> 52:31.021
You were already
too far gone.

52:35.694 --> 52:39.029
Pauline, honey, we're home.

52:39.197 --> 52:40.531
Pauline?

52:43.827 --> 52:46.620
We're home.
Everything all right in there?

52:46.788 --> 52:49.498
I'm fine!

53:17.777 --> 53:20.863
Gracie, Pauline, dinner time!

54:01.571 --> 54:04.073
Pauline, your toilet
is clogged again.

54:04.241 --> 54:06.408
What on earth are you
flushing down there?

54:06.576 --> 54:07.660
I must not be getting
enough fiber.

54:07.827 --> 54:09.245
That's enough.

54:09.412 --> 54:11.580
This is inappropriate dinner
conversation.

54:11.748 --> 54:14.750
Honestly, Bob, sometimes I feel
as if I have a third child.

54:16.920 --> 54:18.379
And just where do you think
you're going?

54:18.546 --> 54:20.047
You haven't asked to be excused.

54:22.509 --> 54:24.218
May I please be excused?

54:24.386 --> 54:26.262
Not until you finish
your dinner.

54:27.931 --> 54:30.766
I'm full, and I don't need
any more calories.

54:30.934 --> 54:34.270
We can't all use menopause
as an excuse for weight gain.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.568
I think you look great.

54:43.863 --> 54:47.700
Dear God, I've had a lot
on my plate recently.

54:47.867 --> 54:50.536
Last week I had sex
for the first time.

54:50.704 --> 54:53.289
My little sister
is slowly dying.

54:53.456 --> 54:57.126
And my mom, as I'm sure you
know, is a total bitch.

54:57.294 --> 55:00.087
I'd accept full responsibility
for all my actions,

55:00.255 --> 55:03.632
but let's face it,
you gave me hormones.

55:59.022 --> 56:00.856
I need to talk.

56:01.024 --> 56:03.442
What did I do?

56:03.610 --> 56:05.152
Nothing.

56:05.320 --> 56:07.696
You didn't do anything.

56:07.864 --> 56:09.698
I just want to talk.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.702
I've been reading this
new book in my book club.

56:13.870 --> 56:17.206
It's caused me to do
a lot of self-reflection.

56:17.374 --> 56:20.876
Although, honestly, sometimes I feel
Iike I'm the only one reading it.

56:21.044 --> 56:22.795
I swear to you, Pauline,
some of these Iadies,

56:22.962 --> 56:25.214
they just use it as an
excuse to get together.

56:25.382 --> 56:28.592
Anyway, it's got me
thinking that...

56:30.303 --> 56:32.930
perhaps I could be
a bit more patient.

56:33.098 --> 56:35.599
Sounds like you joined
the right book club

56:35.767 --> 56:37.309
a few years too late.

56:37.477 --> 56:39.228
Take it easy, Pauline.

56:39.396 --> 56:43.399
Some of your behavior has been
downright sociopathic.

56:43.566 --> 56:44.775
Solely based on the definition,

56:44.943 --> 56:47.903
I don't know a teenager who
doesn't profile as a sociopath.

56:48.071 --> 56:50.989
When I was your age,

56:51.157 --> 56:55.077
my mother hurt me
more than words can say.

56:56.996 --> 56:59.581
I'm still trying
to forgive her for that.

57:05.338 --> 57:08.549
I don't want us to have
that relationship.

57:10.009 --> 57:12.678
Are you finished?

57:28.695 --> 57:30.946
Natalie, oh, my God,
you're a dumb ass.

57:31.114 --> 57:32.698
Cunt is spelled with a C.

57:32.866 --> 57:34.283
Fuck off.
If it's spelled with a K

57:34.451 --> 57:35.784
you still know what it means.
It sounds the same.

57:35.952 --> 57:37.494
Oh, my God, cross it out.
You're an idiot.

57:37.662 --> 57:40.914
- No, it's fine.
- Cunt is with a C.

57:41.082 --> 57:42.833
Yeah, well, Pauline's
a fucking moron, so it's fine.

57:43.001 --> 57:44.835
- You're a fucking moron.
- Fuck off.

58:59.953 --> 59:01.745
I don't understand it.

59:01.913 --> 59:04.706
I don't. What-- what is it
with you, Pauline?

59:04.874 --> 59:06.500
Have you no remorse?

59:06.668 --> 59:09.878
I'm the victim here,
Principal Campbell.

59:10.046 --> 59:12.839
It's not my fault I was born
with a chemical imbalance.

59:13.007 --> 59:14.633
Will you stop making excuses
for yourself?

59:14.801 --> 59:17.386
- I'm not making excuses.
- Yes, you are.

59:17.554 --> 59:19.388
We've been all through your file
and there's no mention here

59:19.556 --> 59:22.057
of any kind
of psychological problem.

59:22.225 --> 59:24.434
Give me five minutes with
a clinical psychiatrist

59:24.602 --> 59:27.062
and you'll have a doctor's note
that will clear this right up for you.

59:27.230 --> 59:28.897
Isn't that how it's done?

59:29.065 --> 59:31.233
No, no.

59:34.654 --> 59:37.197
You will be held accountable

59:37.365 --> 59:40.325
for your own actions.

59:40.493 --> 59:42.369
You understand? You.

59:42.537 --> 59:46.248
You, look super busy.
I'm gonna go.

59:55.258 --> 59:57.884
Suspended indefinitely.

59:58.052 --> 01:00:01.430
You're months away from graduating
and you pull this kind of stunt?

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.890
There's only one explanation
the way I see it.

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:07.769
I have borderline
personality disorder.

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:11.440
It's gone undiagnosed for years
and this was a cry for help.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.192
Go to your room.

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:20.782
Bob!

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:48.602
I need the plunger.

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.437
You and your father
are relentless.

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:53.982
Entering as you knock completely
defeats the purpose of knocking.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.859
Oh, my God.

01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:58.153
What did you do to your arm?

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:01.490
Relax, I'm not a cutter.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.825
It's sort of like a tattoo.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.702
It's hideous.

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:08.872
What on earth would compel
a young girl

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.833
to carve a crucifix
into her arm?

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:15.337
It's the symbol
for the Red Cross.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.839
Bob!

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:28.350
Why is everyone so sad?

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:32.020
We're not sad, honey.
We're disappointed.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.690
Your sister did
a very bad thing today.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:37.859
Do you have any idea

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:41.530
how hard I've worked
to get you into that school?

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.573
Now you're on the verge
of being expelled.

01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:45.492
It makes me sick
to my stomach.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:49.538
I'm not one
to advocate violence,

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.540
but every now and then,
people like Natalie

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.375
need to be punched
in the face.

01:01:54.752 --> 01:01:59.047
I've tried to be supportive,
but I'm finished.

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:03.051
You're delusional
about a career in medicine.

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:06.054
I think at this rate,
you'd have a hard time

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.723
holding down a job
at a fast food restaurant.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.891
Give it a rest.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:13.061
I can always take the GED test.

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:15.230
Open up some sort
of private practice.

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:18.066
Like your father said,
you're delusional.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.764
Never thought I'd say this,

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:52.476
but I'm starting to miss not having
the whole family at breakfast.

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:56.021
I can wake you up for family
breakfast if you Iike.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.232
On second thought,
this is very nice.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.026
Your father and I had
a long talk last night.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:02.194
Jesus Christ.

01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:04.988
Do not use the Lord's
name in vain.

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:07.449
Not now, not ever.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:08.909
Go on.

01:03:09.076 --> 01:03:11.161
I'm not gonna pretend to understand
what you're going through.

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:13.038
It's over my head.

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:14.998
So your father and I have
decided to break the bank

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:17.083
and send you to see
a real psychiatrist.

01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:19.961
The earliest appointment
we could get is for next week.

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:22.839
Hopefully,
you'll have an easier time

01:03:23.007 --> 01:03:25.926
opening up to Dr. Sadler
than you have to us.

01:03:26.093 --> 01:03:29.304
If money is tight, feel free
to dip into my college fund.

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:35.685
We are praying for a miracle.

01:03:35.853 --> 01:03:39.272
It'd be a miracle if Dr. Sadler
could undo the damage

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.441
caused by Reverend William.

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:46.112
We might not have always made
the best decisions for you,

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.157
but we have always had
your best interest in mind.

01:03:58.125 --> 01:03:59.501
Hello.

01:04:02.463 --> 01:04:05.382
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:04:09.762 --> 01:04:12.681
Dr. Gray called with bad news.

01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:17.018
He's recommending that we put
Grace on the transplant Iist.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:19.896
I don't understand,
she looks so healthy.

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:44.337
Where's Mom?

01:04:44.505 --> 01:04:46.006
Mrs. Taylor is sick.

01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:48.300
She's taking a casserole
over to her house.

01:04:48.467 --> 01:04:50.886
What are you doing?

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:54.264
Looking at pictures.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:56.933
I hope I Iive Iong enough
to get married some day.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:02.606
I'm going to do everything in my
power to make sure that happens.

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:10.280
What was that for?

01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:12.782
I've been doing a Iot of
research on your condition.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:15.285
And I read that your
skin tastes Iike salt.

01:05:19.206 --> 01:05:20.749
Yuck.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:29.132
Well, if I ever do
get married some day,

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.593
I want you to be
my maid of honor.

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:57.827
This may seem a little bit
out of character for me,

01:05:57.995 --> 01:06:00.163
but I want to thank you both
for putting up with me

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:01.915
the way that you have.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.917
I tried to call you
several times today.

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:06.628
What have I told you about not
picking up your phone?

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:09.297
Can we not do this right now?
I'm trying to have a heart to heart.

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:12.467
Yeah, let her speak.
I'm enjoying this.

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:13.969
Go ahead, sweetie.

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:17.764
I just want you both to know

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:20.809
that I plan on making you proud.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:25.230
Being expelled from school forced
me to put things into perspective.

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:27.774
I'm turning my life around.

01:06:27.942 --> 01:06:30.485
I realize...

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:32.904
it's not all about me anymore.

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:37.325
Well, I'm glad
to hear that, honey.

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:40.328
Sometimes it takes
hitting rock bottom

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:43.957
for us really to want
to make a change.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:48.253
What your father
is trying to say,

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:51.006
is that we'll believe it
when we see it.

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.841
In other news,

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:55.343
your father and I are gonna go into
the city tomorrow night for dinner.

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.179
Jennifer's gonna come over
and look after you girls.

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:01.349
Jennifer is two years older than me
and she's coming over to babysit?

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:04.352
Jennifer is a very
responsible young woman.

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:12.986
Call Dr. Gray!

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:22.203
I want to thank you
for providing me with the mental

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:25.331
and physical strength
to accomplish great things.

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:28.960
Thank you for believing
in me when no one else does.

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:32.047
Against my betterjudgment,

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:36.051
I guess what I'm trying
to say is

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:38.845
it's getting harder and harder
for me not to believe in you.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.227
I'd ask you to put in a good
word with my parents,

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:47.771
but I've pretty much got
that taken care of.

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:52.901
I'm gonna be out
of reach for a while.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:55.070
I hope you don't get lonely.

01:07:57.281 --> 01:07:58.573
Amen.

01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:27.268
You nearly slept the day away.

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:29.062
I need my eight hours.

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:31.439
Jennifer cancelled, your father
is gonna stay and look after you girls.

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:34.109
He should be home any minute.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.975
I made us some tea.

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.560
Since when do you drink tea?

01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:12.647
Since I started reading
about anti-oxidants.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:14.983
You're not getting any younger.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:18.278
You should take better care
of yourself.

01:09:18.444 --> 01:09:20.947
If Mother cared about you
half as much as I do,

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:23.158
she'd make you
drink tea every day.

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:26.035
Look, Pauline.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:28.997
You need to lay off your mother.

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.999
Everything she does,
she does out of love.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.167
One day you'll understand.

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:47.432
I'm really sorry we got
off on the wrong foot.

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:53.520
I was hoping to make amends.

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:58.151
I've got some old jump ropes.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:03.448
My sister can't use them
'cause of her lungs.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:52.580
Grace?

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:02.799
You're not going to understand

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:05.468
what I'm about to do.

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:09.847
But someday

01:11:10.015 --> 01:11:12.642
you'll thank me.

01:12:52.284 --> 01:12:53.534
Hello.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:27.860
Bob?

01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:32.490
Bob, what happened?

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:35.910
Where's Grace? Bob!

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.412
Grace?

01:13:58.642 --> 01:14:00.685
Gracie?

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:25.168
Gracie?

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:32.925
Gracie!

01:14:35.929 --> 01:14:38.973
Come closer.

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:42.810
I want to show you the detailed
work I did on Grace's sutures.

01:14:46.523 --> 01:14:49.859
It's a mess, I know.

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.778
It's just my first surgery.

01:14:52.946 --> 01:14:54.655
I haven't perfected
my technique.

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:56.324
What have you done?

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:59.911
What have I done?
You mean, with the other one?

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:05.333
I didn't know what to do
with her body

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.793
after I successfully
retrieved the lung.

01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:11.255
So I practiced my incisions.

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:15.176
You have to take
a closer look, Mom.

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:19.972
