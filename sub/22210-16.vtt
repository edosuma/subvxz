WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:06.171
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.256 --> 00:09.124
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.426 --> 00:12.260
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.346 --> 00:14.713
<i>"I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me."</i>

00:15.516 --> 00:17.348
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:20.177
<i>"It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back."</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:23.138
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.565 --> 00:25.727
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

00:26.109 --> 00:28.351
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.446 --> 00:30.778
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.114 --> 00:32.821
<i>This is where
I came out of the Speed Force.</i>

00:33.075 --> 00:35.658
And a wave of dark matter
washed out with you.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.452
DeVoe orchestrated everything to get
the people he wanted on the bus.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.247
But why does he need their powers?
I can't figure out his end game.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.370
We got a planner. Just like Thawne.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.043
I hereby deem Barry Allen's appeal

00:46.129 --> 00:47.916
- denie...
- Wait!

00:48.006 --> 00:50.874
- DeVoe?
- Not DeVoe. It's Ralph.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.711
Barry Allen
is hereby ordered released immediately.

00:55.264 --> 00:57.551
Some people don't think
you should be back on the force.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.511
When do you think I can come back?

00:59.601 --> 01:01.934
When everyone believes DeVoe
is really alive and well.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.556
I call this my "thinking cap."

01:05.190 --> 01:07.477
<i>He only wants the bus metas.
He wants their powers.</i>

01:07.568 --> 01:09.230
- All of them.
- We know a bus meta?

01:09.319 --> 01:11.276
There's three more people out there
who need our help,

01:11.363 --> 01:13.776
and we need to find them
before DeVoe does.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.527
What if...

01:20.455 --> 01:21.741
What if I just, like,

01:21.832 --> 01:26.372
breach all three of the bus metas
to, like, Earth-2?

01:26.503 --> 01:27.664
How about this?

01:27.879 --> 01:29.495
We alter each bus meta's DNA

01:29.590 --> 01:31.547
by performing inter-cellular surgery?

01:31.633 --> 01:33.875
And what, and turn them into chickens?

01:35.137 --> 01:36.127
Yeah.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.011
We're not Frankenstein-ing
innocent people.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.633
Listen, Ramon.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.093
DeVoe wants these bodies.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.303
Maybe we change the bodies,
we keep these people safe.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.684
I'm sorry. Don't you have like six PhDs?

01:47.774 --> 01:49.140
- Seven.
- Yeah, which one of them

01:49.234 --> 01:50.350
is in mad science?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.106
Mad science is just an area of study.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.402
It's not a degree. Okay? And by the way,

01:53.530 --> 01:55.613
I don't see you coming up
with any other ideas.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.908
You know why? 'Cause it's
bedtime over here on Earth-1.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.236
Do you know what bedtime is?
Do they have that on Earth-2?

02:01.330 --> 02:03.071
- Bedtime...
- It's this thing where we just

02:03.165 --> 02:05.908
shut down to recharge our batteries.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.788
- Oh, my gosh.
- I highly recommend it.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.330
- Harry.
- You're still here? What?

02:13.592 --> 02:14.924
No matter what you think,

02:15.218 --> 02:16.550
DeVoe has already thought of it.

02:17.512 --> 02:18.798
So why don't you just go home,

02:18.972 --> 02:20.964
recharge, start again in the morning,
all right?

02:21.725 --> 02:22.932
I'm gonna keep going.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.766
Good night.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.240
Maybe you have thought of everything.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.826
Just like Thawne.

02:54.841 --> 02:55.957
What is all this?

02:56.051 --> 02:57.587
This is gonna give us the edge

02:57.678 --> 02:59.635
we finally need
to be smarter than DeVoe.

03:00.097 --> 03:03.056
Or for me to be smarter
than DeVoe, actually.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.636
Take a look at this.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.722
What is that?

03:07.813 --> 03:09.805
This is an intelligence booster.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.515
You put this thing on Dibny here,

03:12.609 --> 03:13.599
and even he will be able

03:13.694 --> 03:15.105
to understand Poinsot's Construction.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.524
You put it on a real genius,

03:18.323 --> 03:20.155
I'll finally be able to out-think
the Thinker.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.238
You know what?
I'm not sure this "thinking cap"

03:23.328 --> 03:25.365
is the best idea you've ever had.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.491
It's an intelligence booster.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.913
Looks like a thinking cap.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.116
You don't like it, blame yourself.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.872
- You gave me the idea.
- What?

03:31.962 --> 03:33.919
You're the one that said
DeVoe planned all this,

03:34.005 --> 03:35.917
just like Thawne,
in order to stop Barry,

03:36.007 --> 03:36.997
and you said

03:37.092 --> 03:39.209
that DeVoe became the Thinker
the same night you became the Flash

03:39.302 --> 03:43.046
and so I hacked into the security
footage of that night

03:43.140 --> 03:45.928
to see how he did it.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.641
This is why he is so smart.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.264
DeVoe boosted his intelligence

03:53.734 --> 03:55.066
with neurochemical engineering

03:55.152 --> 03:56.359
powered by the dark energy from

03:56.445 --> 03:57.731
the Particle Accelerator explosion,

03:57.821 --> 04:00.734
and if we build our own,
we can do the exact same.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.491
Wait. You want to blast your brain

04:03.577 --> 04:05.193
with ten billion joules of dark energy?

04:05.287 --> 04:07.779
I've harnessed energy from the
Particle Accelerator explosion before,

04:07.873 --> 04:09.159
and I can do it again.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.117
Yeah, but, Harry, re-engineering
your brain's neurochemistry, that's...

04:12.210 --> 04:13.200
DeVoe did it.

04:13.712 --> 04:14.748
So can I.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.004
How many more metas have to die

04:17.507 --> 04:19.293
before we finally stop DeVoe?

04:19.676 --> 04:22.168
Uh... not... not me. I mean...

04:22.637 --> 04:25.380
I say we go for it, right? Right, guys?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.256
What do you think?

04:28.643 --> 04:29.884
I say we explore it.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.595
- Yeah, I agree.
- Ramon?

04:33.315 --> 04:35.352
No, this is way too risky.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.648
Of course, it's risky,

04:36.735 --> 04:38.818
but if we succeed,
we will save the lives

04:38.904 --> 04:40.611
of the four remaining bus metas,

04:40.989 --> 04:42.150
including a member of our team.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.402
You're talking about
intense amounts of dark energy

04:44.493 --> 04:47.201
going right into your brain,
right into that cap,

04:47.287 --> 04:49.074
that turned
a mac-and-cheese-loving pacifist

04:49.164 --> 04:50.496
into a homicidal maniac.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.744
You put that cap on,
what's it gonna do to you?

04:52.834 --> 04:54.291
I ran the numbers dozens of times.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.289
The math and the chemistry
check out. I can do this.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.747
- I don't think you can.
- I can with your help.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.256
Not this time.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.424
All right, let's keep coming up
with more ways to solve this.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.340
Just so I'm clear on this,

05:09.434 --> 05:11.096
someone finally came up
with a way to stop

05:11.186 --> 05:12.973
this La-Z-Boy-riding lunatic,

05:14.773 --> 05:16.139
and we just might not do it?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.188
That's really cool, guys.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.445
- I got this one.
- Yeah, thanks.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.036
It's the only way.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.373
I'm gonna do it
with or without his help.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.793
Hey, Ralph.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.871
Look, don't worry, okay?
We're gonna figure this out.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.331
Yeah, everybody keeps saying that,

05:41.424 --> 05:43.416
and each time we almost get DeVoe,
he gets away.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.546
Every time he gets away,

05:44.636 --> 05:46.252
he's one step closer to getting me.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.837
Hey! That is not going to happen.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.048
Well, I can't
take that chance anymore, Iris.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.928
So, if anyone needs me,
I will be downstairs

05:52.018 --> 05:54.101
in my tiny guest quarters
until this is over.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.894
There are still three bus metas
out there.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.564
And we're gonna need your help
to find them and protect them.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.812
Iris, the only person I need to protect
from now on

06:00.902 --> 06:02.109
is good ol' Ralphy boy.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.440
You are part of this team.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.439
Yeah, and I'm the only one with a body

06:06.533 --> 06:08.069
that DeVoe is trying to snatch.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.407
You don't have any concept

06:09.494 --> 06:11.486
of how dangerous it is for me out there.

06:11.580 --> 06:12.991
Yes, I do.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.165
- How could you?
- Because I am the leader of this team.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.163
Yeah, that's right. You are.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.039
But you're always back there, hiding,

06:20.213 --> 06:21.294
safe and sound.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.081
While the rest of us
are out in the field,

06:24.259 --> 06:26.091
putting our lives on the line.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.060
Hey, sorry I'm late.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.736
Some drama in the Cortex.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.529
- Thanks for the coffee.
- It's all good.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.028
You okay?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.155
Yeah, I'm, you know...

06:52.954 --> 06:55.116
Cecile's in her third trimester,

06:55.206 --> 06:56.697
so it's definitely getting serious.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.657
You guys have any names picked out yet?

06:59.002 --> 07:00.413
Uh, yeah, a few.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.121
Come on, I'm not gonna tell anybody.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.750
No, you're not,
because you're not gonna know

07:04.841 --> 07:06.082
until Cecile tells you.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.134
- All right.
- Anyway,

07:08.929 --> 07:10.261
I talked to Singh

07:10.889 --> 07:12.255
about getting you back in the lab.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.339
Yeah, and?

07:13.433 --> 07:14.514
It's gonna be awhile.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.887
Why? I thought

07:15.977 --> 07:18.094
Judge Hankerson and Singh
had everything they needed.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.554
We thought so, too,

07:19.648 --> 07:22.265
but the mayor wants to sit down
with the DeVoes herself.

07:22.817 --> 07:23.933
Seriously?

07:24.152 --> 07:25.609
Look, we can't find Marlize,

07:25.779 --> 07:27.941
so the only chance we got

07:28.031 --> 07:30.489
is to get Ralph to use his
nauseating powers

07:30.575 --> 07:32.111
to impersonate DeVoe again.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.985
I'll ask him, but right now

07:35.080 --> 07:36.070
he'll barely leave S.T.A.R. Labs.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.247
What happened to that whole
buddy system thing you had going on?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.869
It's not enough for him, I guess.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.417
Then I don't know, Barr.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.254
I should be out there, helping people.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.330
Putting bad guys away.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.165
Right now, we should be trying
to stop DeVoe

07:48.259 --> 07:49.750
and finding those last few bus metas

07:50.595 --> 07:52.803
'cause I got a bad feeling
one of them is gonna show up soon.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.313
Next time, it'll be your hand.

08:02.899 --> 08:03.980
Now,

08:05.026 --> 08:06.892
everybody on the floor.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.732
Dude, you got a death wish?
Do what he says.

08:20.750 --> 08:21.831
Stealing is a sin.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.252
You shouldn't be using the powers
you've been given this way.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.621
I'll use them any way I see fit,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.967
including frying you to a crisp

08:31.052 --> 08:32.337
if you move any closer.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.381
I don't think you will.

08:35.306 --> 08:38.424
You don't want to hurt me
or anyone in this bank.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.972
You can still walk away from this.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.101
But the moment you touch that money,

08:46.192 --> 08:47.683
your life changes forever.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.732
Now, you don't really want that, do you?

08:51.656 --> 08:52.897
Maybe you're right.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.488
Or maybe you've got a death wish.

09:03.501 --> 09:04.867
What the hell?

09:05.879 --> 09:08.166
My powers, they're gone.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.713
No, no, no!

09:12.052 --> 09:13.588
Hey, buddy, you're a real...

09:17.182 --> 09:18.343
hero.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.145
- Cisco.
- Hmm?

09:29.360 --> 09:30.476
What have you got?

09:31.029 --> 09:32.986
Oh, you know, the usual.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.360
Just loads and loads of dark matter.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.989
Makes sense. Eyewitnesses said
this guy melted this vault door

09:39.329 --> 09:40.786
with fire from his hands.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.872
Hmm, figures. And not just any fire.

09:43.958 --> 09:47.076
This fire melted through ten inches
of reinforced steel.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.872
I mean, that would take over
6,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

09:50.965 --> 09:52.706
ten times the thermal output
of Rory's heat gun.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.088
Well, here's where it gets weirder.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.008
Apparently, shortly after,
his powers stopped working.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.380
"Stopped working"?

09:59.516 --> 10:01.758
Yeah, so if he was one of our bus metas,

10:01.851 --> 10:03.433
I guess we have one less to worry about.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.310
How would his powers stop working?

10:05.605 --> 10:06.595
Erik Frye.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.890
Six months ago, were you on the 405 bus?

10:09.275 --> 10:10.265
Please.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.235
Do I look like someone
who takes public transit?

10:14.697 --> 10:16.233
All right, then, Mr. Frye,

10:16.449 --> 10:17.985
how long have you had your powers?

10:18.326 --> 10:19.487
A few years.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.318
You're an OG meta.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.903
And you just started using them now?

10:22.997 --> 10:24.533
Here, yeah.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.537
Once Flash showed up,
I took this act on the road.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.620
Doesn't matter anymore, though.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.376
Right, you don't
have your powers anymore.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.132
'Cause they just disappeared,

10:36.928 --> 10:39.011
vanished into thin air? Huh?

10:39.681 --> 10:40.671
All right, Cisco.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.555
He's clear.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.009
You have any idea how this happened?

10:45.436 --> 10:46.517
One minute, I had powers.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.846
The next, nothing.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.147
Can you get him out of here?

10:51.943 --> 10:53.479
That's right. Get him out of here.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.606
No rights?

10:54.696 --> 10:55.777
Yeah, get him out of here.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.114
I can't believe his powers
disappeared like that.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.408
How does someone lose their powers?

11:02.704 --> 11:03.740
So, I can think
of a couple of ways

11:03.830 --> 11:04.866
this might have happened.

11:04.956 --> 11:08.575
If this Erik Frye metastasizes
solar radiation to create heat,

11:08.668 --> 11:11.001
we could put him in the dark
to de-power him.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.248
But it was still broad daylight.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.878
Okay, maybe his internal
biochemistry has been altered

11:15.967 --> 11:18.209
to create its own internal
thermal combustion,

11:18.303 --> 11:19.760
and he just ran out of fuel.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.462
Okay, so if this guy

11:21.556 --> 11:23.889
is not one of the bus metas,
then that means that

11:23.975 --> 11:25.261
there's still three more out there

11:25.351 --> 11:26.933
before DeVoe gets to me,

11:27.312 --> 11:29.395
so I'm safe... Safer. I'm safer.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.891
Those are innocent people, Ralph.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.065
I'm innocent.
I'm still gonna get terminated.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.517
God.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.186
I'm Sarah Connor.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.481
No. I'm gonna go back to my room,
get some comfort food.

11:40.992 --> 11:41.982
Ralph.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.284
The way I see it,

11:44.871 --> 11:47.113
Frye walks into the bank
with his fire powers,

11:47.207 --> 11:48.698
meets this other guy,

11:49.417 --> 11:52.455
and then his powers are gone.
Coincidence, I think not.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.254
So you think this guy
did something to Frye?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.377
I think we can ask him some questions.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.716
I interviewed every eyewitness
in that bank.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.963
Nobody knew who he was.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.128
Cisco, why don't you cross-check
the deposits from today

12:03.223 --> 12:04.680
with Dad's witness list?

12:04.766 --> 12:06.803
Way ahead of you.
Everyone on the list checks out,

12:06.893 --> 12:08.429
except Matthew Kim,

12:08.519 --> 12:10.636
an EMT out of Central City General.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.891
Barr, let's go ask some questions.

12:12.607 --> 12:13.723
Oh, I'll go.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.686
Barry, you can stay here.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.735
Um, okay, I...

12:18.821 --> 12:19.811
Well, you know, I never go out

12:19.906 --> 12:21.272
into the field,
so I thought, you know...

12:22.617 --> 12:23.824
Yeah, I mean, you're the boss.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.527
Okay, Caitlin, why don't you see

12:26.621 --> 12:27.657
how this power-stealing thing works,

12:27.747 --> 12:28.737
and, Cisco, why don't you use

12:28.831 --> 12:31.323
the satellite's tracking parameters
to scan the city for dark matter?

12:31.918 --> 12:32.908
Mm-hmm.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.034
Okay.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.788
I'll just come running, if you need me.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.293
Okay. Thanks.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.711
Can I hang out in here?

12:51.396 --> 12:52.386
Can you...

12:52.981 --> 12:54.392
Do you mind...
Can you save the eating till later?

12:54.482 --> 12:56.098
We're actually trying
to save lives here.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.733
This is really good though.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.106
- Is it?
- Yeah.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.771
You put this together pretty quick, huh?

13:02.699 --> 13:04.611
Yes, I did, for a test run.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.241
Oh.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.824
I can feel my neurons firing.

13:10.915 --> 13:14.204
Firing at a rate
20 times their normal rate.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.372
And that's without
the addition of dark matter.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.292
I can feel my brain's
processing systems evolving.

13:21.551 --> 13:22.758
There's a 67% chance

13:22.844 --> 13:25.427
you're gonna spill
that mustard on the floor. Oh!

13:26.055 --> 13:27.591
Okay, how did you do that?

13:28.766 --> 13:30.849
Well, I simply
analyzed your eating habits

13:31.227 --> 13:33.594
and extrapolated them into
a predictive behavior model,

13:33.688 --> 13:35.771
all within four seconds.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.269
The cap is working.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.439
Eh, cool, but not quite convinced.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.731
No? Really, you're not convinced?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.362
All right, then.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.485
The answer is none.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.238
And have a little more respect
for your body, will you?

13:52.665 --> 13:53.655
It's a veggie dog, man.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.082
I'm not talking
about the veggie dog, man.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.579
I'm talking about the wiping the mustard
on the pants,

13:56.669 --> 13:58.080
causes the pant movement,
which indicates

13:58.212 --> 14:01.796
a lack of clothing-to-bodily friction,
which can mean only one thing.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.415
Right.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.258
What kind of underwear am I wearing?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.677
And the answer

14:07.930 --> 14:09.046
is none.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.137
You got all that
from your fancy metal cap?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.802
- Yes, I did.
- It's impressive, Harry.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.270
Except for one very small thing.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.347
Which is?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.269
Your head is on fire.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.351
It's not...

14:36.209 --> 14:38.371
When I mentioned
spending more time together,

14:38.461 --> 14:41.124
I meant family barbecues,
not questioning people of interest.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.207
I know. I just want people to know
that I'm not afraid

14:44.300 --> 14:46.087
to go out in the field
every once in a while.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.167
Who says you are?

14:47.637 --> 14:48.718
- Ralph.
- Ralph?

14:48.805 --> 14:50.421
He should talk.
He won't even leave the building.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.757
I know, but he made me wonder, you know,

14:52.934 --> 14:55.221
what kind of leader constantly
puts everyone else's life on the line

14:55.311 --> 14:56.973
except their own?

14:57.146 --> 14:58.136
Baby.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.807
We all know you're fearless.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.937
Whenever you've been needed
on the field, you've gone.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.818
So don't let Ralph get in your head.

15:05.988 --> 15:06.978
Excuse me.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.945
CCPD. We're looking for an EMT
named Matthew Kim.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.026
- Yes, he's right through there.
- There?

15:12.453 --> 15:13.443
Thank you.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.580
Matthew Kim.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.787
Detective Joe West, CCPD.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.994
We'd like to ask you some questions

15:22.088 --> 15:24.831
about the attack
at Central City Bank this morning.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.841
I wouldn't know anything about that.

15:29.303 --> 15:32.546
Really? 'Cause I have
a dozen witnesses that saw you

15:32.640 --> 15:35.053
stand up to the man
that melted the vault.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.806
He was going to hurt people.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.597
It was my duty to help them.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.603
Any reason you left
without making a statement?

15:47.238 --> 15:49.946
I need to finish restocking my inventory
before another call comes in.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.690
- I can't help you.
- Look, Matthew,

15:51.784 --> 15:53.195
we know you had something to do
with the guy at the bank

15:53.286 --> 15:54.322
losing his powers.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.408
We need to know, what did you do to him?

15:58.541 --> 16:00.498
Why? So you can steal mine?

16:00.585 --> 16:01.575
No. No.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.043
- Let her go.
- Put the gun down.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.250
I said, put it down.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.252
He didn't deserve
those powers.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.512
He was hurting people.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.797
Flash.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.050
You're not the only one
that's been blessed with powers.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.679
I'm helping people, too.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.808
Not like this.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.692
You did this, not me.

16:31.908 --> 16:32.989
I got him.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.486
I lost my speed.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.079
What do you mean, you lost your speed?

16:39.248 --> 16:43.083
Uh, guys, I think I found it.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.929
This is amazing.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.141
Yeah, it is.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.351
Well, I've run every test
I can think of.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.850
EKG, cellular regression synthesis,
brain chemistry,

17:04.773 --> 17:05.981
and dark matter confirms it.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.273
Iris is a speedster.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.606
So what about Barry?

17:11.155 --> 17:12.145
Um...

17:12.781 --> 17:15.525
Everything that was a part of you,

17:15.617 --> 17:18.781
your speed, connection to
the Speed Force, the dark matter,

17:19.372 --> 17:21.785
it's all a part of Iris now.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.960
- Can you...
- Reverse it?

17:27.255 --> 17:28.540
I don't know. I can try.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.799
So Matthew Kim isn't just removing DNA.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.127
He's transferring it
to anybody he touches.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.634
He's not getting rid of metas.
He's creating new ones.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.134
Well, that's not the only thing.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.308
Guess who's got an apartment
just a block away

17:41.394 --> 17:44.057
from the 405 bus line
and rides it every day to get to work.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.473
So, Matthew is our bus meta,

17:47.567 --> 17:50.230
not Frye, which means that
DeVoe is gonna come after him

17:50.319 --> 17:51.309
sooner or later.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.653
And if DeVoe gets Matthew's abilities,

17:54.282 --> 17:55.944
he could take away all our powers.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.320
Unless we get him on our side first.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.952
Then he can remove
the meta DNA from DeVoe.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.121
- Would that work?
- I mean, yeah.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.957
It could. As best I can tell,
Matthew's abilities

18:06.043 --> 18:08.205
work by melting down
the highly concentrated bonds

18:08.296 --> 18:09.628
between DNA.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.376
That makes them totally pliable,

18:11.465 --> 18:13.206
so he can extract them
and infuse somebody else

18:13.301 --> 18:14.587
with the exact same meta DNA.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.628
"Melting highly concentrated bonds."

18:18.222 --> 18:19.633
Melting Point.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.844
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I gotta write that down.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.387
Okay, great, so you guys figure out

18:23.477 --> 18:25.059
how to get this Mr. Melting Point

18:25.146 --> 18:26.387
in the same room as DeVoe

18:26.480 --> 18:27.971
and not get his brains sucked out.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.352
I'm gonna go get a couple of bear claws
and go back to my room.

18:30.985 --> 18:34.649
It's not Mr. Melting Point.
Look, it... it's just Melting Point.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.072
You know, somebody out there
has Frye's fire powers right now.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.366
We need to find them as much as
we need to find Matthew.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.488
I'm on it.

18:40.578 --> 18:43.537
And I'll see if there's a way
to reverse this.

18:46.542 --> 18:50.035
Well, until then, what do we do?

18:51.756 --> 18:52.746
We train.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.541
Okay.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.430
Ramon! Where...

19:07.104 --> 19:08.094
There you are.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.179
What are you doing?

19:09.273 --> 19:10.684
I'm updating some software.

19:10.775 --> 19:13.017
Oh, good, so nothing.
Great. I need your help.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.271
Try Ralph.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.895
Ralph's useless, all he does is eat.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.273
What do you want?

19:20.701 --> 19:21.908
Do you have a micro-filament
compression wrench

19:21.994 --> 19:23.326
with a cobalt-retrieving clamp?

19:24.789 --> 19:25.825
Yeah.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.581
Yeah, where is it?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.950
Why? So you can work
on your death cap?

19:30.044 --> 19:31.330
- Not a death cap.
- It's a death cap.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.410
No, it isn't.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.791
I hear there's plenty of tools
on Earth-2.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.622
- Well, I'm on Earth-1.
- You need a lift?

19:35.716 --> 19:37.127
- I'll breach you there right now!
- "I'll breach you there right now!"

19:37.593 --> 19:39.209
- That's not what I sound like!
- "That's not what I sound like!"

19:39.303 --> 19:40.293
Fine.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.182
Cisco, why can't you just help him?

19:47.436 --> 19:49.803
Why am I the only one who thinks
putting a rageaholic

19:49.897 --> 19:51.763
and dark matter together is a bad idea?

19:51.857 --> 19:54.315
He's trying to stop DeVoe.
That's not a bad idea.

19:54.402 --> 19:57.019
He's trying to match his intellect

19:57.113 --> 20:01.232
with a madman whose innovations
are warping his brain.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.987
Have you not seen <i>Spider-Man 2?</i>

20:03.077 --> 20:04.693
- No.
- How can you live with yourself?

20:04.787 --> 20:06.779
It might be dangerous,
but it also might work.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.405
And we're kind of running out of ideas.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.582
Besides, Harry is gonna do this
whether you help him or not.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.790
So maybe there's some way
to make this thinking cap

20:13.879 --> 20:15.290
and to keep him safe.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.424
She can move.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.134
Hey, Iris.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.303
- You might just want to...
- I can't slow down.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.014
That's okay. All right,
just gradually ramp your speed down.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.474
Otherwise, you're going to...

20:38.154 --> 20:39.190
Do that?

20:39.572 --> 20:41.234
Whoa.

20:41.824 --> 20:43.110
Hey, you okay?

20:43.701 --> 20:46.068
- Come here. Are you good?
- Yep. I'm straight.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.903
Thank God for speed healing, huh?

20:48.330 --> 20:49.787
Yeah.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.493
Hey, I know this isn't easy on you.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.165
Hey, I'm fine.

20:56.714 --> 20:57.704
Barry.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.502
I am. I...

21:04.138 --> 21:05.254
I lost my speed.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.346
I lost my job at the CCPD.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.845
Just feels like DeVoe

21:13.522 --> 21:15.559
is slowly taking everything away
from me.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.445
He hasn't taken everything away.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.900
What if I never get it back?

21:28.496 --> 21:29.486
Hey.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.747
Caitlin is gonna find something. Okay?

21:33.209 --> 21:34.199
Hmm.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.662
Until then, you just have

21:40.132 --> 21:42.374
to watch me like I've watched you
these last three years.

21:44.595 --> 21:45.881
Yeah, I guess so.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.845
Wow, that's super annoying.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.602
What's happening?

21:54.688 --> 21:57.180
Baldwin Tower's on fire.
CCFD is responding,

21:57.274 --> 21:58.810
but there's people on the top
floor they can't reach.

21:58.901 --> 22:01.018
Okay, Caitlin,
Killer Frost is on fire duty,

22:01.111 --> 22:03.103
Ralph, Cisco, suit up.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.233
- Yeah.
- Not a chance.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.531
This could just be a trap
for DeVoe to get us out in the open.

22:06.617 --> 22:07.903
I think we got a bigger problem.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.529
We don't have a Flash anymore.

22:09.954 --> 22:10.944
Yeah, we do.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.784
I don't think she's ready
for all that. I mean, she...

22:13.874 --> 22:15.115
You just got your powers.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.420
Um... no, I wanna do this.

22:20.923 --> 22:24.041
Okay, okay, all right,
we'll monitor from here, then.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.716
Okay, well, you can't
go out there wearing that.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.129
Oh, right.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.051
Sorry, Caitlin.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.134
Mask.

22:35.229 --> 22:36.265
Right.

22:38.566 --> 22:39.682
Thank you, Jesse Quick.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.143
Nice.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.727
Please be careful.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.076
Guess you're on comms.

22:51.412 --> 22:52.402
Yeah.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.613
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. How do I...

22:55.249 --> 22:57.081
- Other monitor.
- Wrong monitor.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.668
I'm here.

23:04.758 --> 23:05.839
Oh, boy.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.919
Okay, Iris, there are five people
trapped on the 14th floor.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.262
<i>Just get them out of there
as fast as you can.</i>

23:22.651 --> 23:23.641
I did it.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.728
<i>Great work. Okay, now you've got to
get back in there</i>

23:25.821 --> 23:27.403
to put out the fire.

23:27.948 --> 23:28.984
Right.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.282
Guys, I'm here. What do I do?

23:39.877 --> 23:41.459
You know what to do. Use your arms.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.832
Create a wind funnel,
suck all the oxygen out of the room.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.542
And the fire'll go out.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.670
Just like he's done 1,000 times.

23:48.302 --> 23:49.292
You got this, girl.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.099
It's making it worse.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.392
She is rotating her arms
the wrong way, or?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.186
Go the opposite direction, okay?

24:12.534 --> 24:13.945
Iris, what was that?

24:14.828 --> 24:15.818
Iris?

24:16.705 --> 24:18.116
My leg is pinned. I can't move.

24:21.627 --> 24:24.586
- Okay, you have to phase through it.
- What? I don't know how.

24:27.049 --> 24:29.006
You have to vibrate
your whole body. Okay?

24:29.301 --> 24:30.837
You just... You have to feel it.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.337
I can't. I can't move. I can't do it.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.420
We're running out of time, Barry.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.218
The integrity of the room is failing.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.886
The ceiling is gonna collapse.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.219
Barry, the whole place is going up.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.225
Are you okay?

24:48.529 --> 24:49.736
Yeah.

24:49.822 --> 24:50.903
Thank you.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.910
There's still a little-bit
of irritation in your lungs

25:05.004 --> 25:06.791
from all the smoke
you inhaled last night,

25:06.880 --> 25:08.746
but you should be good to go soon.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.673
Your leg is already healed.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.125
We shouldn't have let her go out there.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.630
You weren't ready.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.383
I saved a lot of people
last night, Ralph.

25:16.473 --> 25:18.590
Yeah, and Cisco had to save you.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.801
Look, we just need to make sure
this doesn't happen again.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.430
We have to find Matthew Kim

25:22.521 --> 25:24.262
and whoever he transferred
Eric Frye's powers to.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.188
How close are you to reversing this?

25:27.317 --> 25:29.183
- I don't know that I can.
- What?

25:29.570 --> 25:32.108
I was up all night trying
every conceivable solution.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.523
Dark matter splicing,
pattern DNA cloning,

25:34.783 --> 25:37.070
even regrowing meta-enhanced
stem material

25:37.161 --> 25:38.402
on a cellular level.

25:38.704 --> 25:39.785
Nothing will work.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.659
I cannot replicate
Melting Point's powers.

25:43.709 --> 25:44.699
So unless we find him and get him

25:44.793 --> 25:46.125
to reverse what he's done...

25:46.295 --> 25:49.663
Iris is Team Speedster
on a permanent basis.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.045
Great, that's, uh... That's great.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.589
I'm gonna go work on my will.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.011
Ralph...

26:12.696 --> 26:13.732
Harry.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.355
Harry, I know you hear me.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.940
Another team member hurt
by one of DeVoe's meta.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.741
- I know.
- And we can fix it, but no!

26:18.827 --> 26:20.159
- I know.
- You know what else?

26:20.496 --> 26:22.112
Snow wasn't the only one
who was up all night working.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.196
I was up all night working.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.371
I'm almost done. I'm almost finished.

26:24.458 --> 26:27.121
- But you won't help me finish.
- I'm gonna help you finish.

26:27.211 --> 26:28.918
- Finish...
- The thinking cap.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.290
I'm gonna help you
finish the thinking cap.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.042
It's an intelligence booster.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.794
Actually, it's called
an intelligence booster.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.215
Two conditions.

26:35.302 --> 26:36.292
What are your conditions?

26:36.386 --> 26:39.675
One, we stimulate your synapses
without using dark matter.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.306
Fine, no dark matter.

26:42.643 --> 26:43.724
And two?

26:43.894 --> 26:45.931
The minute you start acting like
Locutus of Borg

26:46.021 --> 26:47.887
and start assimilating everybody
with your Borg chair...

26:48.065 --> 26:50.102
You can vibe me back to my Earth. Okay?

26:50.442 --> 26:52.024
Okay.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.144
Let's go.

27:04.414 --> 27:05.621
Take it easy.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.457
It's just day two.

27:11.255 --> 27:12.245
Oh, man.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.839
You're right about running.

27:16.593 --> 27:17.754
It's so peaceful.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.421
So calming.
Actually makes it easy to think.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.387
Look, you just got your speed.

27:25.477 --> 27:26.467
You know that, right?

27:26.562 --> 27:27.848
I don't think
anyone'll hold it against you

27:27.938 --> 27:28.928
if you took a minute.

27:29.022 --> 27:31.139
Maybe just let
Cisco and Caitlin handle this.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.225
Just run point. Like always.

27:34.361 --> 27:37.525
Just stay here like I always do?

27:38.240 --> 27:40.072
No, I... you know I didn't mean that.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.822
No, I know you didn't. I did.

27:43.704 --> 27:44.785
Iris...

27:45.539 --> 27:46.746
You think that...

27:47.457 --> 27:48.948
What, that you need

27:49.042 --> 27:50.578
to prove to the team
that you're not afraid?

27:51.128 --> 27:52.790
No, not to all of you. To me.

27:54.423 --> 27:55.630
Barry, when I was a reporter,

27:55.716 --> 28:00.131
I was always in the field
putting myself in danger for a story.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.379
And after last year,

28:03.056 --> 28:05.514
for some reason, that just stopped.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.052
Maybe it was because of Savitar,
maybe because...

28:09.813 --> 28:11.270
you were gone into the Speed Force.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.397
I don't know, but...

28:14.776 --> 28:16.062
I quit my job,

28:17.237 --> 28:18.318
I joined this team,

28:18.405 --> 28:19.896
and now, for the most part,

28:19.990 --> 28:22.403
I just stay here
while all of you are out there

28:22.492 --> 28:24.984
putting your lives on the line.

28:25.078 --> 28:27.536
- Because of our powers.
- No, it's not just that, Barry.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.581
And it took me getting these powers
to realize it.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.625
But now that I'm the one that has it,

28:32.711 --> 28:34.998
it's my turn to do
what all of you have been doing.

28:36.298 --> 28:37.288
To prove to myself that

28:37.382 --> 28:39.590
that fearlessness that I had
is still in me.

28:45.182 --> 28:48.346
<i>Guys, I think we found
Frye's missing powers.</i>

28:50.729 --> 28:51.936
Then go get 'em.

29:01.031 --> 29:03.523
Satellite's tracking temperature
at the same intensity

29:03.617 --> 29:05.779
- as the bank robbery. So...
- That's him.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.701
- Yeah.
- So who's that?

29:08.664 --> 29:10.075
Matthew Kim.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.747
Kim's going to try and steal his powers.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.290
All right, let's go.

29:13.502 --> 29:14.492
No!

29:15.796 --> 29:16.786
You guys run point.

29:18.632 --> 29:19.998
I can do this.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.042
You sure about this?

29:22.636 --> 29:23.717
I have to, Barry.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.466
All right,
but remember, he can't touch you,

29:25.597 --> 29:28.089
- or he'll take your powers away, too.
- Right.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.345
Also, I'm not sure my clothes
are gonna work this time.

29:30.978 --> 29:31.968
I have a fix for that.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.850
It's the best I could do
on such short notice, though.

29:34.940 --> 29:35.930
Thanks, Cisco.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.017
I got hangers.

29:40.404 --> 29:41.770
All right, here we go.

29:41.863 --> 29:44.731
Don't make us shoot you. Stand down.

29:44.825 --> 29:46.908
Oh, I don't think so, copper.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.072
Not until I get my money.

30:06.013 --> 30:08.380
- This is a mistake.
- Down, now! Take him down!

30:08.473 --> 30:09.463
Hold your fire.

30:09.558 --> 30:10.844
You need to stop this.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.301
Oh, I just got going, pal.

30:14.855 --> 30:15.845
Wait.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.181
You're that hero from the bank,
aren't you?

30:19.526 --> 30:20.607
I am.

30:21.278 --> 30:22.769
And I need you to stop this.

30:22.863 --> 30:25.606
So you can take my powers
like you did his?

30:25.949 --> 30:27.030
I don't think so.

30:27.117 --> 30:28.483
You just gave them to me.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.363
What are you talking about?

30:30.579 --> 30:32.036
You didn't know that?

30:32.372 --> 30:35.160
When you took powers from him,
you gave them to me.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.872
And now I'm gonna get
what he couldn't. Money!

30:47.012 --> 30:48.719
I think you've done
enough saving for today.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.262
I'll take it from here.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.186
How about we just end this right now?

30:58.273 --> 30:59.605
That sounds fun.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.058
'Cause I was just warming up.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.437
What's wrong?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.021
Can't stand the heat?

31:07.115 --> 31:09.072
All right, Iris,
we need you to run around him,

31:09.159 --> 31:10.946
create a vortex.
The lack of oxygen should

31:11.036 --> 31:12.948
<i>- extinguish the flame.</i>
- Can't get close to him.

31:13.163 --> 31:14.699
Temperature is at 800 degrees.

31:14.790 --> 31:15.780
Like, how hot is that?

31:16.124 --> 31:17.240
It's hot as lava.

31:17.334 --> 31:18.620
Guys, we need a plan.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.451
I got a plan, lady!

31:20.629 --> 31:23.622
It's called, "Give me my money
before I unleash hell"!

31:23.715 --> 31:24.705
Yeah!

31:26.635 --> 31:27.876
What the hell is that?

31:28.428 --> 31:30.465
That is a thermal cyclone.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.387
That fire is gonna get too close
to those apartments.

31:32.474 --> 31:34.306
And thousands of people will die.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.725
What do we do?

31:36.269 --> 31:37.259
We turn this thing on.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.436
- Harry, no. Don't.
- Iris needs answers.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.139
- We haven't tested...
- She needs answers.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.223
<i>Come on, guys, what do I do?</i>

31:42.317 --> 31:43.353
Do it.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.981
<i>Barry, come on,
I need an answer!</i>

31:50.075 --> 31:51.236
Hang on, Iris. Hang on.

31:53.203 --> 31:56.571
There are 4,827 ways this could go,
and all those ways will fail except one.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.531
If Iris uses her speed
to draw enough water

31:58.625 --> 32:00.617
from Central City Bay into her wake,

32:00.710 --> 32:02.246
she could extinguish that blaze.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.123
You want her to create a tidal wave?

32:06.842 --> 32:08.174
It's our only hope.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.843
Iris, I need you to run
as fast as you can.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.679
- On the water.
- On the water? What?

32:13.765 --> 32:16.098
Make sure, when you run,
you dig your heels in,

32:16.184 --> 32:17.891
<i>you move back and forth
in a tight formation.</i>

32:17.978 --> 32:18.968
Why?

32:19.521 --> 32:21.137
So you drag as much water
ashore as possible,

32:21.231 --> 32:22.517
<i>put out the cyclone.</i>

32:22.607 --> 32:25.224
You want me to make
a 100-foot tidal wave? Are you crazy?

32:25.318 --> 32:26.604
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.357
You told me
that you used to be fearless.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.271
I know that you still are.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.573
<i>You're the bravest person
that I know. You can do this.</i>

32:33.285 --> 32:35.117
I know you can. We all do.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.533
Now, run, Iris. Run.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.055
<i>That's it.</i>

33:05.150 --> 33:07.267
That's it. Now...
And then, tight formations, okay?

33:07.360 --> 33:08.350
<i>Tight formations.</i>

33:13.658 --> 33:15.024
<i>That's it, Iris. Keep going.</i>

33:15.118 --> 33:16.108
Keep going.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.037
Everybody, back!

33:28.131 --> 33:29.338
Move, now!

33:36.014 --> 33:37.721
Long live rock 'n' roll.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.012
Yes!

33:47.984 --> 33:49.020
Nice work.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.102
She did it.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.400
Nice work, Flash.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.464
I'm so sorry I did this to you.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.299
I thought I was cleaning up the city,

34:15.011 --> 34:16.422
but I was just making it worse.

34:16.513 --> 34:17.844
We stopped him.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.014
He's in Iron Heights,
and that's all that matters now.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.099
You sure you both want to do this?

34:27.232 --> 34:28.268
It's your call.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.524
I have to say,
running on water is really fun.

34:35.532 --> 34:38.024
But... if you guys will have me back,

34:38.118 --> 34:40.201
I would love to get back behind
the console again.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.911
- Of course.
- Please, and thank you.

34:44.748 --> 34:45.909
You're ready?

34:46.126 --> 34:47.161
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Let's see.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.451
- Okay.
- All right, here?

34:50.045 --> 34:51.036
Okay.

34:56.761 --> 34:57.842
That's it?

34:57.929 --> 34:59.215
You okay, baby girl?

34:59.889 --> 35:01.175
I think so.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.473
How about you, Flash?

35:10.984 --> 35:11.974
I feel great.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.065
My boy's back.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.318
Well, that's the last time
I'm using this power.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.991
This city was almost destroyed
because of me.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.943
But you had no idea that would happen.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.695
Yeah, don't be so hard on yourself, pal.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.073
I thought I was chosen
for a higher purpose.

35:28.168 --> 35:30.251
This can't be the plan for me.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.620
Maybe you were chosen for a bigger one.

35:33.590 --> 35:34.580
What do you mean?

35:35.675 --> 35:37.211
The guy we mentioned, Clifford DeVoe.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.631
He isn't gonna stop until
he gets all the bus metas,

35:40.138 --> 35:41.470
which means we have to stop him.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.468
We could use all the help we could get.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.513
Are you sure I can make a difference?

35:47.604 --> 35:48.594
Absolutely.

35:48.688 --> 35:51.476
DeVoe's shown weakness
against other bus metas in the past.

35:51.608 --> 35:53.725
With your help,
we might actually have a chance.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.194
How do we start?

35:58.782 --> 35:59.772
I'll give you the tour.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.107
All right.

36:02.118 --> 36:03.825
No offense, I like my powers.

36:09.042 --> 36:10.374
So, Barr,

36:12.587 --> 36:14.954
you never made
your own tidal wave before.

36:15.048 --> 36:16.505
No, I haven't.

36:17.550 --> 36:18.666
You go, girl.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.555
So what do you say? You want to teach
an old dog a new trick?

36:25.767 --> 36:28.726
All right. Training, 6:00 a.m.?

36:29.437 --> 36:31.178
Ooh, don't be late.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.729
- You got it, boss.
- Welcome back.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.110
Hey, Ralph.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.020
Hey.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.690
You know, Matthew

36:43.535 --> 36:45.071
is gonna need a buddy, too.

36:45.662 --> 36:49.155
Well, that's assuming he stays.

36:49.874 --> 36:53.242
After he finds out that DeVoe has gotten
everyone he's come after,

36:53.920 --> 36:55.161
he'll be terrified.

36:57.507 --> 36:58.497
Just like I am.

37:00.510 --> 37:03.173
Look, Ralph.
I know what you're going through.

37:04.514 --> 37:05.846
No, Iris, you don't.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.260
Yes, I do.

37:08.268 --> 37:11.306
Last year, when I thought
that Savitar was going to kill me,

37:12.939 --> 37:14.396
I was scared out of my mind.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.065
How did you deal with it?

37:17.569 --> 37:18.901
It was really hard.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.062
But then I realized

37:21.156 --> 37:23.489
that if I hid from him,
if I hid from the world,

37:24.993 --> 37:26.404
then Savitar had already won.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.403
So I made the decision

37:29.956 --> 37:31.242
to not give in to the fear.

37:32.709 --> 37:33.916
I chose to keep living.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.295
Look,

37:44.262 --> 37:45.878
what I said before about

37:46.890 --> 37:48.506
you never putting your life on the line,

37:49.934 --> 37:50.970
I was wrong.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.556
You make

37:54.481 --> 37:56.188
one hell of a Flash

37:57.942 --> 37:59.433
in or out of the costume.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.441
Thanks.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.536
- You going up?
- Yeah.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.201
I think maybe it's time

38:13.291 --> 38:15.578
that Clifford DeVoe
paid the Mayor another visit.

38:16.169 --> 38:17.159
Hmm.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.546
I thought you were

38:22.050 --> 38:23.712
never leaving S.T.A.R. Labs.

38:24.260 --> 38:27.344
Well... I think maybe it's time
I started living again, too.

38:27.931 --> 38:29.638
Plus, we're definitely out
of veggie dogs.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.183
Hey, thanks, Iris.

38:39.484 --> 38:42.898
Fresh from this little place in Keystone
that Cecile recommended.

38:42.987 --> 38:43.977
Wow.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.564
Those cravings of hers
are getting really intense, huh?

38:46.658 --> 38:47.944
Yeah, tell me about it.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.570
It's a good thing I'm a speedster again.

38:52.121 --> 38:54.363
You know you didn't have
to give up your speed, right?

38:55.416 --> 38:57.032
I mean, I would have never asked you to.

38:57.502 --> 38:58.663
I know.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.204
Why did you do it?

39:04.384 --> 39:05.750
You know what makes a great speedster?

39:09.806 --> 39:11.138
It isn't their speed.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.307
It's being the light that everyone needs

39:14.394 --> 39:15.601
when the world goes dark.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.140
It's the kind of person they are.

39:19.649 --> 39:21.311
The kind of person
that always wants to help.

39:22.902 --> 39:24.609
That's why being the Flash

39:25.280 --> 39:26.646
is your destiny.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.065
It's your way of helping others.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.280
But it isn't mine.

39:42.672 --> 39:43.662
This is.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.926
I'll leave you to it.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.138
All right, take it off.

40:34.307 --> 40:36.014
Take it off, Harry. That's enough.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.930
We're already 20 percent over
your suggested safety limits.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.431
You've got to give it
a little more time.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.137
No, that's it. I'm shutting it down.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.642
No, we're almost there.
We're almost there!

40:43.733 --> 40:45.474
You're not breaking bad, Locutus!

40:45.568 --> 40:47.560
All right?
I'm disengaging the photon flow.

40:50.698 --> 40:51.688
All right.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.453
I don't need it anymore.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.416
You got the names?

41:03.670 --> 41:05.832
The last two remaining bus metas.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.632
Janet Petty and Edwin Gauss.
