01:38.249 --> 01:40.382
Grab that ladder, bro.

01:42.582 --> 01:46.781
Okay. Grab everything that you've got.

01:48.682 --> 01:50.680
Where the hell are we?

01:50.682 --> 01:52.847
Where are we headed?

01:52.849 --> 01:55.346
Due north. It's a hike.

01:55.348 --> 01:57.313
Then another ten minute ride in.

01:57.315 --> 02:00.013
What, man? Are you serious?
'Cause you already had us

02:00.015 --> 02:02.079
travelling an hour in this wilderness.

02:02.081 --> 02:04.079
What's the matter, Tex?
Tired already?

02:04.081 --> 02:06.146
Fuck you, man.

02:11.013 --> 02:14.512
Well, come on. I said north!

02:14.514 --> 02:18.179
Come on, man. It's
freezing here. Just keep moving.

02:23.412 --> 02:25.478
Ready to win this?

02:25.480 --> 02:27.477
Sleeping bag.

02:27.479 --> 02:30.410
Megs.

02:30.412 --> 02:33.010
I can't wait to
get to Florida.

02:33.012 --> 02:35.943
We can share lodgings.

02:47.277 --> 02:49.276
Phew! What's that smell?

02:49.278 --> 02:51.475
Man!

03:11.941 --> 03:13.907
Don't you think
you're overdoing it?

03:13.909 --> 03:15.907
They're just kids.

03:15.909 --> 03:17.907
Death's an exact science.

03:39.773 --> 03:41.970
All aboard!

03:42.772 --> 03:45.070
Nice ride.

03:49.005 --> 03:52.036
Hoes before bros.
You're an ass.

03:55.704 --> 03:57.803
I'm going to the back,
drink cocktails...

04:20.869 --> 04:23.201
Okay, you got me
on this one.

04:23.203 --> 04:26.200
Over the next few hours,
copper oxide from the coins

04:26.202 --> 04:28.167
will react
with the body fluids.

04:28.169 --> 04:30.300
Leaving a coin imprint
on the body tissue,

04:30.302 --> 04:33.233
used for determining the length
of time the body's laid there.

04:33.235 --> 04:35.432
Smart. These kids won't
know what's hit them.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.732
Anything I should
know about?

04:42.734 --> 04:45.465
They've been washed down
with acid long ago.

04:45.467 --> 04:47.765
Used for our company's
offender rehabilitation programs

04:47.767 --> 04:49.899
a while back.

04:49.901 --> 04:53.098
You can't leave dead bodies
lying around a national park.

04:53.100 --> 04:57.165
13 Eerie's the ideal spot.
No one's been here in years.

04:57.167 --> 05:01.063
It's gonna feel more like a boot
camp than a science retreat.

05:01.065 --> 05:03.631
Well, unfortunately most crime
scenes are inhospitable.

05:03.633 --> 05:06.230
My students are up
to the challenge.

05:06.798 --> 05:08.863
You hear that?

05:10.131 --> 05:12.129
What?

05:12.131 --> 05:14.129
That's just it. Nothing.

05:14.131 --> 05:16.729
Where's the wildlife?

05:31.130 --> 05:33.127
Larry, how'd you get
involved in this?

05:33.129 --> 05:35.127
Probation.

05:35.129 --> 05:38.294
So, not your first time
on the prison bus?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.960
Anything about this
place we need to know?

05:40.962 --> 05:46.226
What you got here is Guantanamo
Bay's ugly twin sister.

05:47.261 --> 05:50.260
Joking aside, some bad shit has
happened here in the past.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.425
Great. What you got
is your new D-MORT.

05:52.427 --> 05:54.059
Your what?

05:54.061 --> 05:56.059
Disaster Mortuary
Operational Response Team.

05:56.061 --> 05:57.592
Go, Daniel.

05:57.594 --> 05:59.759
What kind of bad shit?

05:59.761 --> 06:03.625
I don't know. Take a look.
Your guess is as good as mine.

06:03.627 --> 06:06.159
Oh, man. Welcome to hell.

06:55.688 --> 06:57.686
Driver's Larry Jessop.

06:57.688 --> 07:00.387
I had him set up the
communication system you wanted.

07:00.389 --> 07:03.787
He'll assist you. You rely on
him for anything you need.

07:12.419 --> 07:14.418
Larry Jessop.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.485
Tomkins.

07:16.487 --> 07:18.819
I'll be your chauffeur
and your chef

07:18.821 --> 07:20.818
and your all-around
dog's body.

07:20.820 --> 07:23.484
I need you to charge up
the communication batteries.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.684
Okay.

07:25.986 --> 07:27.985
Welcome to Eerie Strait.

07:27.987 --> 07:29.984
There are only two places
available

07:29.986 --> 07:31.984
in the forensic
trainee's scheme.

07:31.986 --> 07:33.984
You will need to work in pairs.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.617
Each group will be assigned
a plot within the complex.

07:36.619 --> 07:38.750
Study it thoroughly.

07:38.752 --> 07:40.949
Some of you will be
working alongside entomology.

07:40.951 --> 07:42.949
Others will be combining
your expertise

07:42.951 --> 07:44.949
in toxicology and geology.

07:44.951 --> 07:46.949
This is quite deliberate.

07:46.951 --> 07:49.249
Forensic science D-MORT
internship does not discriminate

07:49.251 --> 07:51.249
science applications when
a full passenger flight

07:51.251 --> 07:53.516
or passenger train crashes.

07:53.518 --> 07:55.982
Compound secured perimeter
means nothing gets in or out.

07:55.984 --> 07:57.982
Plot 13 Eerie Strait
is now uninhabited,

07:57.984 --> 08:00.115
surrounded by low-lying
swampland.

08:00.117 --> 08:02.848
If you check page two,
there are three basic cabins.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.548
One is for food and equipment,
the other for accommodation,

08:05.550 --> 08:07.680
while this one is for
surveillance and instructions.

08:07.682 --> 08:09.814
Eerie's out of range
for cell phone use,

08:09.816 --> 08:11.814
so you will be given
walkie-talkies.

08:11.816 --> 08:14.580
Each site is in a remote
area of the camp

08:14.582 --> 08:16.780
so there will be no contact
between groups.

08:16.782 --> 08:18.846
Questions?

08:19.580 --> 08:21.579
No? Good.

08:21.581 --> 08:24.546
Get your things.
We'll meet back here.

08:24.548 --> 08:26.546
Looks like we're
on different teams.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.979
Just as well. You'd only
cheat at pathology.

08:28.981 --> 08:32.011
What about Josh?
Uh, he's with Stetson.

08:32.014 --> 08:34.445
One thing's for sure.
This place is a rathole.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.410
This is gonna be like
a day trip with Charlie Manson.

08:39.580 --> 08:42.345
No, no, no, no, no.
The meat goes over there.

08:42.347 --> 08:45.711
That is not the kitchen. Drop it
and come back for your kit.

08:45.713 --> 08:46.544
What's in 'em?

08:46.546 --> 08:49.177
How would I know?
I drive the bus.

08:49.179 --> 08:51.977
Just drop your stuff
and come back for it.

08:51.979 --> 08:54.877
In there, but don't
touch anything.

09:38.275 --> 09:40.340
Oh fuck!

09:47.006 --> 09:49.305
Agh! Shit.

09:57.839 --> 09:59.837
Be done by breakfast.

09:59.839 --> 10:01.837
Better be.

10:01.839 --> 10:04.337
Gotta get those bodies
back to the morgue.

10:21.504 --> 10:23.503
Beds are for
sleeping only.

10:23.505 --> 10:26.435
Any more than one person
per bed and it will break.

10:26.437 --> 10:28.535
Is that a joke?
That's a joke.

10:28.537 --> 10:31.368
That was a joke, right?
Ha, ha, ha.

10:31.370 --> 10:33.801
You're fucking kidding me.

10:33.803 --> 10:36.901
What were you expecting, Megan--
a mint on your pillow?

10:36.903 --> 10:38.901
Yeah, that's right.

10:38.903 --> 10:42.167
I think I will
take this one.

10:44.169 --> 10:47.134
Are you getting friendly
with the locals?

10:47.136 --> 10:49.300
There's lunch.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.565
Prof wants us back at
the command centre.

11:02.567 --> 11:04.766
That used to be a cat.

11:04.768 --> 11:07.098
Daniel's already got
some pussy in his bed.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.165
Meow.

11:17.699 --> 11:20.964
Time is 11:20 hours. Get into
your designated groups.

11:24.464 --> 11:26.530
You'll be working
in isolated areas.

11:26.532 --> 11:29.430
Personal radio contact
is strictly prohibited.

11:29.432 --> 11:31.763
Conversing outside your
allotted team will disqualify

11:31.765 --> 11:33.996
not only yourself,
but your partner as well.

11:33.998 --> 11:35.529
I will lead the
chemical analysis tomorrow

11:35.531 --> 11:36.729
with Captain Veneziano.

11:36.731 --> 11:39.395
It will be cold. You'll work
through the night.

11:39.397 --> 11:41.529
Criminals don't pick the
perfect beach in Hawaii

11:41.531 --> 11:43.529
to make life comfortable
for forensic scientists,

11:43.531 --> 11:46.028
so get used to it.

11:46.030 --> 11:49.062
Pick up your gear on the
way out. Good luck.

11:55.362 --> 11:58.061
See the prison back
there, coming in?

11:58.063 --> 12:01.527
sure didn't want people
leaving in a hurry.

12:01.529 --> 12:05.093
What the hell have
I got myself into?

14:03.852 --> 14:06.249
Oh, shit!

14:10.284 --> 14:12.416
Dude, it's just
a field exam.

14:12.418 --> 14:15.715
Yeah, buddy. I just get a
little bit claustrophobic.

14:15.717 --> 14:17.949
Well, man up.

14:17.951 --> 14:20.648
Why don't you shut up?

14:20.650 --> 14:24.381
You couldn't have picked
a worse place to die.

14:45.981 --> 14:48.012
11:55 hours.

14:54.347 --> 14:57.045
Taking trace evidence
of soil, mineral,

14:57.047 --> 15:00.112
and what looks to be
dried blood.

15:17.777 --> 15:19.776
Ready?

15:19.778 --> 15:22.176
Yeah.

15:31.676 --> 15:35.042
Maggots. That's our first line
of investigation.

15:43.642 --> 15:46.041
If you're gonna puke,
do it in the bushes.

15:46.043 --> 15:48.007
Otherwise, you'll
contaminate the area.

15:48.009 --> 15:50.073
I'm fine, man. I'm okay.

15:53.741 --> 15:55.740
Fifteen millimetres.

15:55.742 --> 15:58.673
Means the corpse has
been dead one week.

16:02.707 --> 16:05.272
Look. Pupal casings.

16:05.274 --> 16:08.505
They've started the
metamorphosis into adult flies.

16:10.507 --> 16:13.071
Group C, you're gonna
need to collect the larva

16:13.073 --> 16:15.071
and prepare a full
field analysis.

16:18.438 --> 16:20.437
How long do we have?

16:20.439 --> 16:22.938
All night, but don't
drag your heels.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.437
Sundown in approximately
three hours.

16:25.439 --> 16:28.404
Oh, and by the way I've
downgraded you both

16:28.406 --> 16:31.137
to 60% due to Mr. Novagratz
throwing up.

16:33.604 --> 16:37.436
Have a cold one on me,
Colonel Fucking Mustard.

16:46.670 --> 16:48.768
Group A, after your
sample collection,

16:48.770 --> 16:51.568
I want you to do a standard
biochemical analysis.

16:59.702 --> 17:01.900
Temper, temper.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.964
Hey!

17:40.732 --> 17:43.363
Yes?

17:43.365 --> 17:45.664
You heard about this
place, right? Why?

17:45.666 --> 17:47.663
Well, you heard
the rumours.

17:47.665 --> 17:49.663
Eerie Pen,

17:49.665 --> 17:51.930
death row inmates,
one way ticket.

17:51.932 --> 17:54.596
Government started
doing crazy tests

17:54.598 --> 17:56.995
and poison ends up
in the water supply.

17:56.997 --> 17:59.895
Women start having babies
before their time or worse.

17:59.897 --> 18:04.129
I mean, nothing lives here.
No one lives here.

18:04.131 --> 18:06.562
What are you
trying to tell me?

18:06.564 --> 18:09.395
Two of my chickens
are missing.

18:09.397 --> 18:12.095
Maybe they flew away.

18:12.097 --> 18:14.427
This is a scientific
examination, Mr. Jessop.

18:14.429 --> 18:16.461
My students are
working into the night.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.627
We have a responsibility
to them so I would appreciate it

18:19.629 --> 18:22.294
if you could deliver
the food to the groups.

18:22.296 --> 18:26.259
Just follow the
coloured flags.

18:33.461 --> 18:37.692
Shoot, Larry.
Welcome to summer camp.

19:13.925 --> 19:15.789
Oh!

19:16.590 --> 19:19.322
Oh, shit! What are you doing?

19:20.356 --> 19:23.288
Shit!

19:27.855 --> 19:29.921
How you doin'?

19:32.055 --> 19:34.253
Here.

19:34.255 --> 19:37.920
The fluids on that coin
and the imprint left on the body

19:37.922 --> 19:41.820
will tell us
how long it's been here.

19:45.554 --> 19:47.619
You running it?

19:48.554 --> 19:51.653
Yup.

19:53.820 --> 19:59.085
Here I am playing nursemaid to a
bunch of college butt jerk-offs.

19:59.087 --> 20:03.251
Shoulda stayed in jail.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.316
Holy shit!

20:40.183 --> 20:43.948
Hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no,
no,stop! Contamination area!

20:43.950 --> 20:45.947
I thought back there
was your site.

20:45.949 --> 20:46.815
Where's the markers
for your body?

20:46.817 --> 20:49.047
You're standing on one.

20:49.049 --> 20:51.814
You can clearly see the
site we're working in.

20:51.816 --> 20:53.814
You got two bodies?

20:55.816 --> 20:58.313
Maybe you shouldn't
be so close.

20:58.315 --> 21:00.380
Some people can have
unexpected issues

21:00.382 --> 21:03.446
with this type of
medical science.

21:03.448 --> 21:05.979
Listen, baby doll,
I know what I saw.

21:05.981 --> 21:07.979
There's another body.

21:07.980 --> 21:10.646
A woman, kinda, 200 yards up
by the ruined building.

21:10.648 --> 21:13.312
You don't believe me, go
take a look for yourself.

21:13.314 --> 21:17.079
Group A, you are not allowed
to speak to any third party.

21:17.081 --> 21:20.578
Mr. Jessop, I already told you
this is a scientific field exam.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.344
We're midway through
a forensic medical procedure.

21:23.346 --> 21:25.977
Professor Tomkins
asked you to leave.

21:27.112 --> 21:29.477
I'll go take a look
if you want.

21:29.479 --> 21:31.877
Be my guest.

21:46.110 --> 21:48.842
Well, is that
one of yours?

21:48.844 --> 21:50.842
No.

21:50.844 --> 21:52.842
Professor Tomkins, over?

21:52.844 --> 21:55.542
Team A, go ahead.

21:55.544 --> 21:58.075
Did you put out three
cadavers for medical research?

21:58.077 --> 22:00.141
Yes, why?

22:00.143 --> 22:03.008
Well, we've located another one.
She's female, Caucasian,

22:03.010 --> 22:05.741
approximately 30 to 40
years of age.

22:05.743 --> 22:08.340
Impossible. Go back and
support your colleague.

22:14.340 --> 22:16.339
Do you copy?

22:18.341 --> 22:20.639
Jeez.

22:26.540 --> 22:28.605
What?

22:29.039 --> 22:31.439
She-she moved.

22:31.441 --> 22:33.604
Idiot.

22:33.606 --> 22:35.905
No, she--

22:38.806 --> 22:41.037
Ms. Cranston, report back
to your team leader.

22:41.039 --> 22:43.571
Mr. Jessop, report
back to base. Over.

22:43.573 --> 22:45.737
Yes, sir.

22:45.739 --> 22:50.170
This place is one stop
from hell.

23:11.103 --> 23:13.601
First stage decomposition.

23:27.268 --> 23:29.900
Temperature must have been
over 52 degrees Fahrenheit

23:29.902 --> 23:33.399
for the blowflies
to fly out of the cadaver.

23:39.966 --> 23:41.965
They also like salsa,
playing poker,

23:41.967 --> 23:44.099
and they make a
mean margarita.

23:44.101 --> 23:47.699
I saw something,
over there. Look.

23:47.701 --> 23:50.165
We've already been
downgraded because you puked,

23:50.167 --> 23:54.564
so let's try and get this
part right, shall we?

23:55.965 --> 23:59.164
So, the temperature must have
been over 52 degrees Fahrenheit

23:59.166 --> 24:02.264
for the blowflies
to fly out of the cadaver.

24:05.032 --> 24:10.096
Oh, thank God, they didn't
cheap out on the walkies.

24:10.098 --> 24:13.163
Larry was right. There's a
female corpse in our patch.

24:13.165 --> 24:15.163
Maybe we should
go take a look.

24:15.165 --> 24:17.829
Uh, well, we've only just
started analysis on this one,

24:17.831 --> 24:20.228
so why don't we get
cause of death first

24:20.230 --> 24:22.629
and then I'll go take
a look with you.

24:22.631 --> 24:24.629
Tomkins didn't say
there'd be two.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.628
Well, that's the thing
with the professor.

24:26.630 --> 24:29.895
He is always challenging us,
setting up situations.

24:29.897 --> 24:33.594
That's why he's the best
and that's why we are here.

24:33.596 --> 24:35.594
Should we check
in with him?

24:35.596 --> 24:37.827
Ah, walkies down. No.

24:37.829 --> 24:41.027
And he said
we're on our own.

24:41.029 --> 24:43.860
So, what's he
always telling us?

24:43.862 --> 24:47.460
Forensic science is a slow,
patient, and dedicated analysis.

24:47.462 --> 24:51.826
Right. It's all in the details.
That's how you catch bad guys.

24:51.828 --> 24:53.826
So, why don't we please
just concentrate

24:53.828 --> 24:57.059
on our lady of the lake here
because I need this internship.

24:57.061 --> 25:00.325
Not all of us have private
funds to get us through college.

25:00.327 --> 25:02.325
What if we're supposed
to find them?

25:02.327 --> 25:04.458
Remember what Ivanek told us
happened last year.

25:04.460 --> 25:06.792
If you're so worried,
why don't you take this,

25:06.794 --> 25:07.792
get us something to look at

25:07.794 --> 25:10.857
and come back
in five minutes. I need you.

25:23.458 --> 25:26.356
Place gives me the creeps.

25:38.190 --> 25:40.188
Just hold on a second,
right there.

25:40.190 --> 25:42.655
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey. Stop! Wait!

25:42.657 --> 25:44.655
This is a
contaminated area.

25:44.657 --> 25:47.088
Well, whatever man.

25:52.321 --> 25:54.887
Can I help you?

25:56.688 --> 25:59.420
Watch your back.

26:03.154 --> 26:05.386
What the hell
does that mean?

26:05.388 --> 26:07.652
I don't know.

26:08.054 --> 26:10.353
Smells like dog food.

26:13.953 --> 26:15.951
My battery's dead.

26:15.953 --> 26:18.185
Mine's on the way
out as well.

26:53.883 --> 26:56.548
Team C, how far have you gotten
with your measurements?

26:56.550 --> 26:59.281
Sir, Rob's got 95%
of the larva...

27:01.549 --> 27:03.781
...losing battery
power... walkie talkie...

27:03.783 --> 27:06.281
Should we head back to camp
and replace them?

27:06.283 --> 27:10.014
Report back to base.
Copy that, headed back.

27:10.016 --> 27:13.814
I found some tissue
under the fingernail.

27:13.816 --> 27:17.713
Let's head back and take
care of this battery situation.

27:28.646 --> 27:30.879
Oof! Oh!

27:34.079 --> 27:36.211
Here.

27:40.246 --> 27:42.411
Did you see that?

27:42.413 --> 27:46.344
I swear it was someone
in an orange prison suit.

27:46.346 --> 27:48.377
A lifer jump suit.

27:48.379 --> 27:51.044
You been smoking
some of Larry's pot?

28:00.377 --> 28:03.043
Group A, Group A,
return to base camp. Over.

28:06.376 --> 28:08.676
Group A, Group B,
can you hear me?

28:12.543 --> 28:14.608
Larry, where the hell are you?

28:35.941 --> 28:38.273
Professor?

28:39.307 --> 28:41.305
Professor?

29:13.139 --> 29:15.703
Hello? Anyone there?

30:04.099 --> 30:06.332
Agh! No!

30:46.697 --> 30:50.094
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God!

30:56.728 --> 30:58.794
Oh God!!!

31:01.995 --> 31:04.327
Kate?

31:56.957 --> 31:59.122
Oh, Christ, Pat.

31:59.124 --> 32:01.588
I'm in the middle of
electrophoresis on the corpse.

32:01.590 --> 32:03.588
Oh, I'm sorry, dude.

32:03.590 --> 32:05.755
Should I leave you two
alone to get it on?

32:05.757 --> 32:08.755
Did you get anything
out of the walkies?

32:08.757 --> 32:09.755
No, not a thing.

32:09.757 --> 32:11.687
Also, we're out
of body fluid cleaner.

32:13.689 --> 32:15.687
Did you hear that?

32:15.689 --> 32:18.087
Yeah. Those guys are probably
just messing around.

32:18.089 --> 32:21.053
I need to cross reference
the results from the fluids

32:21.055 --> 32:24.619
on that coin, but I think this
body's been here about 12 hours.

32:25.154 --> 32:27.786
Daniel, Meg, is that you?

32:27.788 --> 32:30.419
Weird.

32:32.420 --> 32:34.419
You all right?

32:34.421 --> 32:36.585
Just let me out.
Just let me out.

32:36.587 --> 32:37.752
Okay, ow fuck!

32:37.754 --> 32:39.219
Just wait.
Let me out. Ow.

32:39.221 --> 32:42.885
Whoa, whoa, whoa hey, hey, hey.
What's up? Don't panic.

32:42.887 --> 32:45.917
Just breathe into it.
You'll be okay.

32:47.285 --> 32:49.450
Where are you going?

32:49.452 --> 32:53.751
What are you looking at, man?
There's nothing there.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.850
I'm going to
see the prof.

33:00.852 --> 33:03.050
No, no, man.
You don't quit on me.

33:03.052 --> 33:05.049
I'm not quitting
on you, Patrick.

33:05.051 --> 33:09.082
Everybody gets the shakes, man.
It's common. It'll blow over.

33:09.084 --> 33:11.649
That scream wasn't someone
just playing around.

33:11.651 --> 33:15.281
And I just saw something move
in the woods over there.

33:15.283 --> 33:18.015
You can't just
leave me here.

33:18.017 --> 33:20.081
Goddamnit!

33:25.582 --> 33:28.414
Kate!

33:38.214 --> 33:41.680
Oh my God! Oh my God!

33:43.047 --> 33:45.479
Help!

33:45.481 --> 33:48.079
Kate! Oh my God, oh my God!

33:48.081 --> 33:50.078
Here, you'll be okay.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.345
Stand, stand, stand.

33:52.347 --> 33:55.145
Stay up, stay up, stay up.

33:56.346 --> 33:58.444
Oh God.

33:58.446 --> 34:00.811
Sit down, sit down,
sit down, sit down.

34:00.813 --> 34:03.811
Oh sorry, oh sorry!
Oh! Okay, okay.

34:03.813 --> 34:06.478
Don't go into shock!
Don't go into shock!

34:06.480 --> 34:09.810
Don't go into shock! Don't go
into shock! Don't go into shock!

34:14.877 --> 34:17.643
Okay, no, stay awake!
Oh God, sorry, okay, okay.

34:17.645 --> 34:20.876
Listen, listen, listen,
this is going to sting a little.

34:34.309 --> 34:36.308
Professor?

34:36.310 --> 34:38.274
Daniel? Anybody?

34:40.275 --> 34:43.407
Kate's been hurt.

34:45.241 --> 34:49.407
No! Oh shit!
No, no, no, no, no, no.

35:42.904 --> 35:45.235
Group C, Group A,
can you hear me?

35:45.237 --> 35:47.235
Group C, Group A, come in. Over.

35:47.237 --> 35:49.235
Where the hell
have you been?

35:49.237 --> 35:51.235
The communication system's
completely screwed.

35:51.237 --> 35:53.202
The monitors are going down.

35:53.204 --> 35:56.534
We gotta get those kids outta
here and I mean right now.

35:56.536 --> 35:59.134
Really. And what do you
base that conclusion on?

35:59.136 --> 36:01.800
Something was following me.

36:01.802 --> 36:05.134
Moved like a man.
Sounded like an animal.

36:05.136 --> 36:07.333
I hit my head.
I was out cold.

36:07.335 --> 36:10.699
I was so still
that it lost me.

36:10.701 --> 36:13.699
See I spoke with Veneziano
when I got this detail.

36:13.701 --> 36:15.699
He knows all about it.

36:15.701 --> 36:18.132
I thought he was pulling
my leg, you know,

36:18.134 --> 36:20.132
trying to put
a scare on me.

36:20.134 --> 36:23.565
All those things you hear
about military experiments

36:23.567 --> 36:26.132
and changing a man's DNA,

36:26.134 --> 36:30.531
make a creature
fueled only by rage.

36:30.533 --> 36:33.697
Well, that all happened
and I think that

36:33.699 --> 36:38.564
maybe they left something behind
or maybe something escaped.

36:38.566 --> 36:41.197
So, now what?
They're chasing you?

36:41.199 --> 36:45.163
That dead thing by Group A,
that was one of 'em.

36:45.165 --> 36:47.163
You know what?

36:47.165 --> 36:50.663
I'm getting really sick of your
conspiracy pothead bullshit.

36:50.665 --> 36:53.396
Professor, you are a smart man,
but we stay here,

36:53.398 --> 36:56.895
you gonna learn something.

36:56.897 --> 37:00.729
You know what I've learned so
far? You can't do your job.

37:00.731 --> 37:03.495
None of the walkies
are working.

37:03.497 --> 37:05.795
Come with me.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.894
What now?

37:13.996 --> 37:16.960
Generator's going. There's a
short in the system somewhere.

37:59.257 --> 38:01.657
What the hell
happened here?

38:01.659 --> 38:05.656
What happened, see, was stuff
came out of the barrel

38:05.658 --> 38:09.789
and, um, it-it-it melted them.

38:09.791 --> 38:12.222
Just poured out by itself?

38:15.657 --> 38:19.055
Look at this. You can see
through the goddamn wires.

38:19.057 --> 38:22.321
Well, hell, it's not my fault.
I didn't put that crap there.

38:22.323 --> 38:25.555
What worries me is
what's in that evil shit.

38:25.557 --> 38:28.587
Yeah, well, what worries me
is you being a moron.

38:31.355 --> 38:34.220
Yeah, I know.
Your walkies are dead.

38:34.222 --> 38:36.687
Larry, replace them.

38:36.689 --> 38:39.686
I'll give you an extra time
credit to cover the delay.

38:39.688 --> 38:42.653
That's a little present
from Mr. Jessop.

38:42.655 --> 38:45.087
Is it gonna work?

38:46.220 --> 38:49.353
All right. Let's head back.

38:49.355 --> 38:51.419
We need to fix this.

38:59.386 --> 39:01.951
Go check the monitors.

39:03.952 --> 39:06.517
Today, Larry!

39:34.416 --> 39:36.482
Oh, shit!

41:14.874 --> 41:17.440
Open the door.
We need to get inside.

41:20.107 --> 41:22.372
Where is everybody?

41:24.974 --> 41:28.871
One of those
corpses walking around.

41:28.873 --> 41:31.072
What did he just say?

41:31.074 --> 41:34.871
He said one of the corpses
has come to life.

41:34.873 --> 41:37.404
What?

41:39.838 --> 41:42.204
What the hell is this?

41:43.838 --> 41:45.837
You think an
animal did this?

41:45.839 --> 41:47.837
My money's on
the professor.

41:47.839 --> 41:51.136
He's playing games with us.
He wants to see how we'll react.

41:51.138 --> 41:54.569
Let's grab some samples. Look
at them under the microscope.

41:54.571 --> 41:57.170
This is no animal.

42:00.837 --> 42:02.902
Where are you going?

42:02.904 --> 42:05.035
Rob, come on. You're gonna
get us disqualified.

42:05.037 --> 42:07.035
I have to follow
my instincts.

42:07.037 --> 42:09.234
My gut's telling me
get outta here.

42:09.236 --> 42:12.835
Well, say hi to your buddy
in the orange jumpsuit for me.

42:13.235 --> 42:15.867
It's just a test.

42:21.802 --> 42:23.801
Where are the others?

42:23.803 --> 42:25.800
You tell me.

42:25.802 --> 42:27.800
You checked all
the connections?

42:27.802 --> 42:29.800
I saw something
on the monitor.

42:29.802 --> 42:32.733
Because of you, I may have to
cancel this entire examination.

42:32.735 --> 42:34.800
I saw something
in the woods.

42:34.802 --> 42:37.732
You are both welcome to
quit anytime you want.

42:37.734 --> 42:40.266
I heard screams.
There was screaming.

42:40.268 --> 42:42.799
Listen, you're all
overreacting, all right?

42:42.801 --> 42:45.365
That's very common when
dealing with real corpses

42:45.367 --> 42:47.332
for the first time.

42:47.334 --> 42:50.432
Look, man, we just want to
know what's going on.

42:50.434 --> 42:54.965
Hey, guys, why don't we just
get on the bus and go home?

44:03.759 --> 44:07.058
Aaahhhh!

44:07.060 --> 44:09.857
Aaaahhhhh, fuck!

44:50.655 --> 44:53.588
Is that Rob?

44:57.355 --> 44:59.353
Is that a gun?

44:59.355 --> 45:01.587
Give it to me,
I'll go find them.

45:01.589 --> 45:04.720
Sit down!
You're safer in here.

45:04.722 --> 45:06.719
You think that peashooter's
gonna help?

45:06.721 --> 45:09.719
That thing I saw out there
was already deader than dirt.

45:09.721 --> 45:11.719
Did you hear that one?

45:11.721 --> 45:14.118
Hey, hey, man.
What did you see out there?

45:14.120 --> 45:16.785
I told you, college boy,
I saw a dead person

45:16.787 --> 45:18.751
and he was walking around.

45:18.753 --> 45:20.018
I'm going out there.

45:20.020 --> 45:22.217
No, no, man. We stand
a better chance together.

45:22.219 --> 45:23.351
We stand a better chance

45:23.353 --> 45:26.484
if we just haul outta here.
Call in an air strike.

45:26.486 --> 45:29.784
The safety of all my students
is at risk here, Mr. Jessop.

45:29.786 --> 45:32.550
Now, are you volunteering
to run out and find them,

45:32.552 --> 45:34.550
especially after you
destroyed all our equipment?

45:34.552 --> 45:36.617
No?

45:36.619 --> 45:38.950
Then I suggest that
everyone stay put

45:38.952 --> 45:42.016
until we can get our eyes
and ears up and running.

46:47.512 --> 46:49.577
Hey, come on. Open the door.

46:52.111 --> 46:54.110
What the hell's going on?

46:54.112 --> 46:56.109
Where's Rob?

46:56.111 --> 46:58.176
I thought he was
with you, man.

46:58.178 --> 47:00.176
We heard screams.
Where's Megan?

47:00.178 --> 47:02.842
How the hell should I know?
What do you mean?

47:02.844 --> 47:04.842
Maybe their group
was attacked first.

47:04.844 --> 47:06.842
What do you mean attacked?

47:06.844 --> 47:10.008
What do you mean attacked?
What do you mean? Who?

47:10.010 --> 47:11.975
Stop it! Stop it!

47:11.977 --> 47:14.741
Never mind! She can handle
herself. She's a fighter!

47:14.743 --> 47:17.474
Yeah, that's what worries me.
Just stop it, all right?

47:17.476 --> 47:20.541
Fighting each other is not gonna
help Megan or anybody else.

47:20.543 --> 47:23.640
Now, while I don't believe a
Goddamn word this asshole says,

47:23.642 --> 47:27.273
I do concede there may be
someone or something out there.

47:27.275 --> 47:29.340
I going to find her.

47:31.641 --> 47:35.340
Let's go find Rob.

49:24.131 --> 49:26.330
Sorry, Rob!

50:01.261 --> 50:03.494
No! No!

50:52.790 --> 50:54.889
Okay.

52:02.951 --> 52:05.016
Megan!

52:09.917 --> 52:12.248
Megs!

52:40.948 --> 52:43.079
Jesus Christ!

52:54.481 --> 52:57.178
Shoot it again!

53:05.412 --> 53:08.744
Shit! I cut myself.

53:19.644 --> 53:21.709
Well, don't open
the goddamned door!

53:21.711 --> 53:23.709
We need to kill it.

53:23.711 --> 53:26.009
You better pray
there's only one.

53:52.109 --> 53:54.073
There's two of them.

53:54.075 --> 53:56.873
I know! I said not to
open the goddamned door!

53:56.875 --> 53:59.206
This shit's all over me.

53:59.208 --> 54:01.206
Did it bite ya!

54:01.208 --> 54:03.273
Where's the gun?

54:06.406 --> 54:08.472
Oh, crap.

55:34.965 --> 55:37.364
Hey, asshole!

56:38.893 --> 56:40.892
Ah!

56:40.894 --> 56:43.491
Run!

56:51.492 --> 56:54.457
Gasoline. I know
you got gasoline!

56:57.258 --> 57:02.290
What I'm gonna do is I'm going
to make a Molotov cocktail

57:04.724 --> 57:07.556
and we're gonna
burn that bitch.

57:10.657 --> 57:13.289
Yeah. Yeah.

57:25.523 --> 57:27.621
I'm getting the gun.

57:27.623 --> 57:31.587
Yeah, a gun will be better.
A gun will be better.

57:42.054 --> 57:44.119
It's there.

57:55.453 --> 57:58.318
You go inside.
I'll finish her off.

57:58.520 --> 58:01.218
Shoot her in the head.

58:29.250 --> 58:31.749
Professor!

58:44.781 --> 58:46.847
Professor!

58:48.815 --> 58:51.081
Professor!

59:28.411 --> 59:31.743
Yeeeoooowwww!!!

59:31.745 --> 59:34.110
Ahhh! Ahhhh-aahhh-ahhhh!

59:41.743 --> 59:43.942
Larry!

59:48.010 --> 59:50.008
Larry!

59:52.010 --> 59:54.075
Larry!

59:57.109 --> 59:59.174
Larry!

01:00:00.208 --> 01:00:03.307
Larry!

01:00:29.672 --> 01:00:31.671
Hey!

01:00:31.673 --> 01:00:34.938
Let's check in here for
some sort of weapon.

01:00:44.671 --> 01:00:46.837
Ah, shit!

01:00:46.839 --> 01:00:50.003
You all right?

01:00:50.137 --> 01:00:52.803
Here. I'm not
taking any chances.

01:00:52.805 --> 01:00:55.203
Me either, bro.

01:01:10.336 --> 01:01:13.034
Where's Tomkins?

01:01:13.969 --> 01:01:16.134
Shoot me.

01:01:16.136 --> 01:01:18.134
He's lost.

01:01:18.136 --> 01:01:20.234
Shoot me!

01:01:23.301 --> 01:01:25.300
No, come on.
We should--

01:01:27.402 --> 01:01:29.933
He's dead.

01:01:29.935 --> 01:01:31.933
Megs, let's go.

01:01:31.935 --> 01:01:36.500
No, no, no, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!

01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:48.398
Bus.

01:02:00.365 --> 01:02:02.463
Okay, it's clear. Come on.

01:02:04.397 --> 01:02:06.563
Daniel!

01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:09.430
Where are the others?

01:02:09.432 --> 01:02:11.096
Kate and Rob are... dead.

01:02:11.098 --> 01:02:12.096
Josh and Patrick?

01:02:12.098 --> 01:02:14.096
Still out there,
as far as we know.

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:18.529
Take this.
Lock the door.

01:02:18.531 --> 01:02:20.629
We'll meet back here.

01:02:21.996 --> 01:02:24.062
Shit.

01:02:40.528 --> 01:02:42.794
Okay, okay.

01:02:52.794 --> 01:02:54.992
How do you get off
this fucking island!

01:02:54.994 --> 01:02:58.392
We gotta cross that river
and we gotta scale barbed wire.

01:03:01.459 --> 01:03:04.058
How many of them
are there?

01:03:05.693 --> 01:03:07.958
I don't know.

01:03:16.124 --> 01:03:18.190
That's not my blood.

01:03:19.824 --> 01:03:22.990
I killed Kate and Rob.
I had to!

01:03:22.992 --> 01:03:25.623
Okay.

01:03:30.324 --> 01:03:32.522
We're gonna to get
out of here, okay?

01:03:34.456 --> 01:03:36.822
We're gonna get
out of here.

01:03:36.824 --> 01:03:38.888
Okay.

01:03:40.956 --> 01:03:42.588
If I get bit by one of those,

01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:45.288
you have to
shoot me in the head.

01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:47.321
You listen to me.

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:50.221
No, this is not
gonna happen.

01:03:50.223 --> 01:03:53.887
You're not gonna turn into one
of those things. I promise.

01:03:53.889 --> 01:03:56.120
Okay.

01:04:12.886 --> 01:04:14.952
Hey, hey.

01:04:15.453 --> 01:04:17.452
What is it?

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:19.818
There.

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:24.017
Oh shit! Run!

01:05:28.813 --> 01:05:30.879
It's Larry.

01:05:33.913 --> 01:05:37.011
I'm gonna kill Larry.

01:05:44.345 --> 01:05:46.777
Aaarrrgggghhhhh!

01:05:53.045 --> 01:05:55.043
Fuck!

01:05:55.045 --> 01:05:57.210
Oh shit! Oh shit, man!

01:05:57.212 --> 01:05:59.542
Get to the bus!

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:10.209
Close the door!

01:06:10.211 --> 01:06:12.842
Come on, man!

01:06:15.677 --> 01:06:17.675
Jeez! We'll hotwire it!

01:06:17.677 --> 01:06:19.675
Come on, man!

01:06:19.677 --> 01:06:22.374
Come on, man!
I can't hold 'em long!

01:06:23.309 --> 01:06:27.207
I can't hold 'em long! Come on!
Get the fuck out of here.

01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:37.206
That was the bus.
It's gotta be Josh.

01:06:41.208 --> 01:06:43.473
There's the keys.

01:06:43.475 --> 01:06:46.438
There's creatures getting in!
Fuck! They're getting in, man!

01:06:49.973 --> 01:06:52.805
Something's getting in!

01:06:52.807 --> 01:06:54.804
Turn the ignition!

01:07:16.837 --> 01:07:19.936
I'm gonna go check it out.
You stay here.

01:07:21.703 --> 01:07:23.869
I got your back.

01:07:38.835 --> 01:07:40.900
Daniel!

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.098
Oh! Oh! I'm sorry!
Oh, I'm sorry!

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:02.032
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

01:08:02.034 --> 01:08:04.098
You got my back.

01:08:07.666 --> 01:08:09.731
I'm so sorry.

01:08:15.631 --> 01:08:17.630
Stop!

01:08:17.631 --> 01:08:19.697
There they are.

01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:22.630
Come on, come on!

01:08:24.198 --> 01:08:26.263
Get in.

01:08:27.831 --> 01:08:30.263
Come on, come on,
come on! Get in!

01:08:30.697 --> 01:08:32.662
Is he okay?

01:08:32.665 --> 01:08:34.796
All right.
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:08:34.798 --> 01:08:38.062
Get us out of here.
I'm trying.

01:08:42.362 --> 01:08:44.962
Holy shit! There's another one.
Hold on.

01:08:44.964 --> 01:08:48.228
Yeah, run him over.
Come on, run him over.

01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:50.295
Hang on!

01:08:57.328 --> 01:08:59.327
Behind us!

01:09:01.328 --> 01:09:04.493
Come on, man.
What are you doing?

01:09:04.495 --> 01:09:06.693
I'm tired of
goddamned running.

01:09:21.194 --> 01:09:23.258
The gearshift's stuck!

01:09:29.225 --> 01:09:29.890
Come on, man.

01:09:29.893 --> 01:09:31.291
Hurry up, hurry up!

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:32.224
Stick won't move.

01:09:32.225 --> 01:09:34.756
Help me! Help me!

01:09:34.759 --> 01:09:37.689
Fuck!

01:09:39.424 --> 01:09:41.457
Shit! Oh shit!

01:09:47.622 --> 01:09:49.622
Fuck!

01:09:49.624 --> 01:09:52.087
Oh shit! Oh shit!
Do it, man!

01:09:54.124 --> 01:09:56.255
Go! Go!

01:10:07.556 --> 01:10:09.821
Watch out!

01:10:33.287 --> 01:10:38.019
Josh, get us the fuck
out of here! Now!

01:10:58.185 --> 01:11:00.450
I think he's hurt.
Patrick?

01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:06.549
Fuck!

01:11:06.551 --> 01:11:08.982
Josh! Josh! Josh! Move!

01:11:10.984 --> 01:11:13.182
No! No! No!

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.146
Thank you! Thank you!

01:11:39.148 --> 01:11:41.246
Josh!

01:11:41.248 --> 01:11:43.345
Can we go please?

01:11:43.347 --> 01:11:45.412
Now?

01:11:48.313 --> 01:11:50.345
Josh, go.

01:12:04.546 --> 01:12:07.178
Let me take a look at this.

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:10.577
Shit, the bullet's
still in there.

01:12:10.579 --> 01:12:13.010
I'll try and stop
the bleeding. Hang on.

01:12:25.243 --> 01:12:27.642
I can't see anything!
Keep going!

01:12:34.409 --> 01:12:36.575
I can't see anything.

01:12:36.577 --> 01:12:39.208
Smoke's in my eyes.

01:12:40.276 --> 01:12:42.274
Slow down!
The gate!

01:12:49.741 --> 01:12:51.973
Slow down!

01:13:10.106 --> 01:13:12.905
Oh, oh fuck!

01:13:12.907 --> 01:13:15.671
I can't fucking stand.
My knee's fucked!

01:13:15.673 --> 01:13:18.371
Daniel, we need help.
I can't see a thing.

01:13:18.373 --> 01:13:21.304
You're gonna be all right,
you're gonna be all right.

01:13:21.306 --> 01:13:23.371
I got him.

01:13:24.638 --> 01:13:28.336
We gotta get out of here.
I smell gas.

01:13:43.403 --> 01:13:46.002
God, my knee's fucked up.

01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:49.368
Aghh. God, man.

01:13:51.335 --> 01:13:54.834
We have to get this fixed.
I'm gonna pop this back in.

01:13:54.836 --> 01:13:56.901
Here.

01:13:56.903 --> 01:13:58.967
Put this in your mouth.

01:14:00.902 --> 01:14:03.400
Okay? We're gonna go on
the count of three.

01:14:03.402 --> 01:14:05.400
One, two--

01:14:10.834 --> 01:14:13.900
Get him up.
We gotta get going.

01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:59.829
This way.

01:15:05.929 --> 01:15:08.461
Anybody home?

01:15:27.728 --> 01:15:29.793
Daniel?

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:34.893
I'll take a look around.

01:15:34.895 --> 01:15:37.392
I gotta get this
bullet out of you.

01:15:37.394 --> 01:15:40.525
Ah, let's not start digging
around in there right now, okay?

01:15:40.527 --> 01:15:42.591
You want to keep that in there,

01:15:42.593 --> 01:15:45.958
just to remind me of what
I did to you every day?

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.024
Sounds like a good plan.

01:16:29.422 --> 01:16:31.487
Fuck!

01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:36.053
It's over there.
I heard something.

01:16:36.055 --> 01:16:39.653
I'm gonna distract it.
You cover Daniel.

01:16:45.554 --> 01:16:47.619
Hey, hey.

01:16:48.487 --> 01:16:50.652
You can't move around, okay?

01:16:52.787 --> 01:16:55.985
Look, I got this one, okay?
Just wait here.

01:16:55.987 --> 01:16:58.851
You're gonna be good.

01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:44.281
Shit!

01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:47.776
Hey, asshole!

01:19:00.842 --> 01:19:03.107
Noooo!

01:19:24.206 --> 01:19:27.239
You sure took your time.

01:19:31.806 --> 01:19:35.471
Come on.

01:19:35.473 --> 01:19:37.538
Let's go find Daniel.

01:20:01.936 --> 01:20:05.602
I heard the bus crash.
Anybody else get out?

01:20:05.604 --> 01:20:07.602
No.

01:20:07.604 --> 01:20:09.602
Daniel's lost
a lot of blood.

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:13.034
What happened?

01:20:23.001 --> 01:20:25.200
Hey. Hey!

01:20:27.434 --> 01:20:29.967
Stop! Stop!

01:20:37.067 --> 01:20:39.066
Hey.

01:20:39.068 --> 01:20:42.298
Professor Tomkins,
I tried the walkie.

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.465
Christ, what the
hell happened?

01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:48.798
Eeuunnhh!

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.898
Now, you're gonna tell me
what was in those barrels

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.097
and about the
inmate experiments.

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:56.264
This was a death
camp wasn't it?

01:20:56.266 --> 01:20:58.364
I had low-level clearance.

01:20:58.366 --> 01:21:01.730
They just sent the lifers
on death row. It didn't go well.

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.730
What happened?

01:21:03.732 --> 01:21:05.797
Eeuunnhh!

01:21:06.698 --> 01:21:09.296
What happened?!

01:21:09.298 --> 01:21:13.163
Something went wrong.
They turned into--

01:21:13.165 --> 01:21:15.562
but that was years ago.

01:21:15.564 --> 01:21:18.229
Jesus Christ,
you broke my nose.

01:21:19.663 --> 01:21:22.828
I lost four people
in there. Kids!

01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:26.561
