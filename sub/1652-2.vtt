00:02.503 --> 00:06.238
<i>- Beheading--</i>
<i>that's a signature cartel move.</i>

00:06.240 --> 00:08.540
Adres dias, aka pulpo.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.641
Open up!

00:09.643 --> 00:11.643
[gunshot]
officer shot!

00:11.645 --> 00:14.313
Stop!
- [grunts]

00:14.315 --> 00:15.514
- You played games.
- Back up, voight.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.782
- And you got her killed!

00:16.784 --> 00:19.251
- That's my partner's blood.
- [grunts]

00:21.755 --> 00:24.356
- Antonio,
someone's taken diego.

00:27.327 --> 00:29.261
[tires screeching]

00:29.263 --> 00:32.296
- Come on.
Go, antonio.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.266
Mitchell, let him in,
let him in.

00:34.268 --> 00:38.137
- Laura!
- Antonio...Antonio!

00:38.139 --> 00:40.539
[gasps]

00:40.541 --> 00:41.807
Oh, god.

00:41.809 --> 00:45.811
He's got to be so scared.
- I will get him back.

00:45.813 --> 00:49.114
- I know you will.
You have to.

00:49.116 --> 00:50.215
- What do we know?

00:50.217 --> 00:51.650
- There's no cameras
in the alley.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.720
We're checking the streets
on both sides for atm video.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.055
- Neighbors?

00:56.057 --> 00:57.423
- One lady gave us
a white van,

00:57.425 --> 01:00.192
But no license,
no driver description, nothing.

01:00.194 --> 01:03.062
Detectives are rolling,
squads are canvassing the area

01:03.064 --> 01:04.263
And knocking on doors,
checking for cameras.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.664
Someone's on the pods
right now.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.599
- We have security cameras
out front,

01:07.601 --> 01:10.069
But nothing in the alley.
- I know.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.170
- <i>Para laura, para laura!</i>
<i>- Sir--</i>

01:11.172 --> 01:12.471
- [speaking spanish]

01:12.473 --> 01:15.541

Let him in!

or your son dies."

01:34.227 --> 01:37.162
Where's my son?
- Uh--

01:40.266 --> 01:43.402
Uh, I know
he's not here.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.337
Beyond that--

01:45.339 --> 01:46.705
- I don't think you want me
to ask you again.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.608
- Ah, <i>si, si, si, si.</i>

01:49.610 --> 01:52.144
I heard about this type of thing
back in bogota.

01:52.146 --> 01:56.415
Yeah.
Your son was kidnapped, yes?

01:56.417 --> 01:57.816
[chuckles]
yes.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.352
Yeah, I read that
many times.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.488
Many, many times.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.389
If the kidnappers were
given what they wanted,

02:04.391 --> 02:08.526
Then the wife or son

02:08.529 --> 02:10.863
Was returned,

02:10.865 --> 02:14.500
Not a single scratch
on their faces.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.201
[bang]

02:16.203 --> 02:18.370
Maybe you should give 'em
what they want, antonio,

02:18.372 --> 02:20.839
Whatever that may be.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.709
If you want to see diego again,
that is.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.762
[doorbell chimes]

02:48.835 --> 02:50.369
- Hi, erin.
- Emmy, liam.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.604
Hey, guys.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.806
Is your dad home?

02:54.808 --> 02:57.910
- Hey, dad!
Erin's here!

02:57.912 --> 03:00.345
- Yeah?
- Alec?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.381
Um--

03:02.383 --> 03:04.850
- [whispers]
hey, you guys want to go inside?

03:04.852 --> 03:05.884
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.220
- Bye, erin.
- Bye!

03:08.222 --> 03:11.456
- Jules...

03:11.458 --> 03:13.492
Uh--

03:13.494 --> 03:17.396
- [crying]

03:35.315 --> 03:37.883
- They took antonio's son.

03:37.885 --> 03:42.321
And they took my own,
as far as I'm concerned.

03:42.323 --> 03:45.857
Nothing else matters
till we get diego back.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.760
Nothing.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.565
- Sarge...

03:53.567 --> 03:55.267
So this all started

03:55.269 --> 03:59.271
And both did essentially
the same job for pulpo,

03:59.273 --> 04:00.606
Mid-level distribution,
right?

04:00.608 --> 04:02.608
So we know
pulpo's cleaning house.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.543
And what do you do when you
get rid of old furniture?

04:04.545 --> 04:06.778
You got to bring in
something new.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.280
This guy stood out.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.015
It's ernesto milpas.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.985
He was running 15 corners
between 22nd and kedzie

04:12.987 --> 04:16.288
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I was on that bust with jules.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.322
- He was released last year.
- He was a climber.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.458
- Maybe he's looking
to get promoted.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.660
- He's the best
of a lot of bad options.

04:21.661 --> 04:22.961
- What do we have on him now?

04:22.963 --> 04:26.031
- P.O.'s got an address
that's a year old.

04:30.570 --> 04:34.306
- Olinsky, olinsky!
- Yeah?

04:34.308 --> 04:35.440
- Hey.
- Hey, let's go, man.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.342
I'm ready to nail
this son of a bitch.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.811
- First we gotta get dressed.
- You can just pick one.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.648
- All right,
now, our job on this one

04:42.650 --> 04:43.949
Is to put early eyes
on the place

04:43.951 --> 04:46.018
And then provide backup
as well.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.519
- Roger that.

04:47.521 --> 04:51.790
[phone ringing]

04:51.792 --> 04:53.292
- Fiancee?

04:53.294 --> 04:54.993
- Yeah.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.729
- Have you talked to her?
- No, not yet.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.997
- She still doesn't know
what you do?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.366
- When's the last time
you brushed your teeth?

05:01.368 --> 05:03.568
- I'm supposed to be homeless,
man.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.771
- That's not a good excuse.

05:05.773 --> 05:10.609
- Okay, you guys have 118.
- Thanks, sarge.

05:10.611 --> 05:14.012
- Atwater and burgess,
car number 452.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.814
- 452?
[laughter]

05:15.816 --> 05:18.083
- What?

05:18.085 --> 05:20.419
- You two with us today.
- Yes, sir.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.888
- Come on.
- Dawson.

05:22.890 --> 05:26.491
Look, whatever you need,

05:26.493 --> 05:27.592
You have my support.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.761
- Thank you, sir.

05:32.699 --> 05:36.034
- Let's talk.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.836
All right, look,
what's going on?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.504
- He basically accused me
of getting willhite killed

05:39.506 --> 05:41.073
In front
of the entire district.

05:41.075 --> 05:44.676
- You're on the wrong side
of the bars right now, voight.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.478
- Yeah, what does that say
about your police skills

05:46.480 --> 05:47.879
If they gave me
the job you wanted?

05:47.881 --> 05:50.382
- Quite enough.
Belden, go take a walk.

05:56.889 --> 06:00.659
Hank, I hope
this don't shock you,

06:00.661 --> 06:01.960
But there's some people
who think

06:01.962 --> 06:04.129
You don't deserve to be
back on this job.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.399
- Well, so far,
you got a dead cop

06:07.401 --> 06:09.735
And an abducted kid
as a legacy.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.636
This is gonna be
a real short stint

06:11.638 --> 06:13.805
If you don't
turn things around.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.874
[exhales]

06:18.044 --> 06:19.644
- 452?
- Yep.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.713
- Okay.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.620
- [sniffs]
oh, god. What--

06:28.622 --> 06:31.990
- Oh, no.
What did you do to platt?

06:31.992 --> 06:33.825
- I didn't do nothing to platt.
What did you do to platt?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.127
- You must have
done something.

06:35.129 --> 06:36.962
- Burgess, I'm gonna
tell you this right now.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.865
Don't walk down a road
you can't come back from.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.166
- Okay, fine.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.068
I called her a house mouse.
- You didn't.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.103
- She ran me
all over creation

06:45.105 --> 06:48.840
For this gaudy ring
of her cousin's, and then she--

06:48.842 --> 06:50.876
I'm sorry.

06:50.878 --> 06:55.013
Sometimes my temper can hinder
my ability to communicate.

06:59.018 --> 07:02.921
- I don't know how
antonio's handling all this.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.458
If I had a kid snatched up,
I would be incoherent.

07:08.161 --> 07:13.165
I used to think that cops
under voight were invincible,

07:13.167 --> 07:16.201
And then jules died.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.971
I was holding her hand.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.074
As a soldier,
how did you deal with it?

07:25.511 --> 07:27.879
- Generally...

07:27.881 --> 07:31.216
Take it out on those
who didn't deserve it.

07:39.225 --> 07:40.759
- Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

07:45.498 --> 07:47.732
[machines whirring,
workmen chatter]

07:57.743 --> 07:59.077
[rustling]

07:59.079 --> 08:01.146
- Jeez.
What are you, a ninja?

08:01.148 --> 08:05.083
You gotta make some noise
or something, man.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.552
- Anything?
- No.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.225
You kidding me?

08:13.227 --> 08:14.226
All right,
all I got is a 20.

08:14.228 --> 08:17.863
I want that back later.

08:17.865 --> 08:22.834
[cell phone vibrates]

08:22.836 --> 08:24.603
- She'll think
you're having an affair.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.204
- Nah.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.973
I told her they pulled me
out of the academy

08:27.975 --> 08:30.141
To do paperwork
in the ivory tower.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.244
- Ah, that's original.

08:32.246 --> 08:33.578
- I don't want her
to worry.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.114
- End it now, kid.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.982
Avoid a lifetime
of misery and despair.

08:37.985 --> 08:42.520
- Go find
another garbage can, huh?

08:51.230 --> 08:54.099
- That's him.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.567
- There's our boy.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.706
What the hell
is ruzek doing?

09:07.146 --> 09:08.713
Everybody, go, go!

09:11.083 --> 09:13.018
- Damn it, freeze!

09:43.215 --> 09:44.783
[both grunt]

09:46.319 --> 09:49.020
- [groans]

09:53.192 --> 09:55.660
Suspect is on foot
out the southwest side

09:55.662 --> 09:57.596
Of the warehouse.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.731
[siren wailing]

10:11.210 --> 10:13.311
[tires screeching]

10:16.015 --> 10:18.883
- Coming out!
He's in the wind.

10:21.187 --> 10:25.290
[police radio chatter]

10:25.292 --> 10:26.958
[dog barks]

10:26.960 --> 10:29.060
- [groaning]

10:29.062 --> 10:30.328
- Hey.
You okay, kid?

10:30.330 --> 10:33.064
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm an idiot, but I'm fine.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.399
- Hey, it wasn't your fault.
Trust me.

10:34.401 --> 10:38.169
- No sign of diego
that he was ever here.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.904
We had him!
What the hell was that?

10:39.906 --> 10:41.272
- Hey, I made a move.
- Take it easy.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.041
- A stupid one!
- Take it easy, take it easy.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.242
- Let's not forget
who let herself get jumped!

10:44.244 --> 10:47.045
- Hey, I--

10:48.080 --> 10:49.114
- Detective dawson,
this is burgess.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.850
You're gonna want
to see this.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.252
- Let's go.
Come on.

11:03.229 --> 11:07.666
- Tell me you have something.

11:09.735 --> 11:12.170
- [speaking spanish]

11:12.172 --> 11:17.709
- Scream, and we cut out
your tongue.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.177
- [grunts]
daddy.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.881
They say
they're gonna kill me, daddy.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.716
[muffled shouts]

11:24.718 --> 11:26.317
- Check out the paneled wall.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.319
That's not here.

11:28.321 --> 11:34.325
.

11:34.327 --> 11:40.098
Maybe some others
came in with pulpo

11:40.100 --> 11:43.368
We can run down.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.705
- [sighs]

11:46.707 --> 11:50.775
I know this goes against
everything we stand for.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.478
We should consider
making the deal.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.280
Give them pulpo for diego.
- Antonio.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.216
- He's my son, voight.
Let's make the trade.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.185
- Trades don't work out, bro.

12:00.187 --> 12:03.321
No one above
would okay it.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.857
- Tell me which one of those
excuses I'm supposed to believe.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.260
- We still have time.

12:12.031 --> 12:14.032
All right, go through these
one by one.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.367
See if anyone crosses
with pulpo or ernesto.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.470
These are mine.

12:18.472 --> 12:20.305
- Okay, look, remember,
the red-tabbed files

12:20.307 --> 12:22.040
Are the cis
that have been paid out, okay?

12:22.042 --> 12:24.175
And you--hey, no.
No, no, no, no.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.112
You gotta keep it separate,
or you're gonna get it confused

12:27.114 --> 12:28.413
With the other ones, and you--
- jin!

12:28.415 --> 12:29.414
- I told you--
- jin.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.317
- What you got so far
on the video?

12:32.319 --> 12:35.286
- [sighs] okay.
It was recorded last night.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.856
There are some other voices
in the distance

12:37.858 --> 12:39.958
On the audio track,
so there's reason to believe

12:39.960 --> 12:43.461
Back room of a bar,
maybe a motel.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.462
It's really not much
to go on, though.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.331
- Thanks.

12:46.333 --> 12:50.135
Halstead, lindsay,
come here a sec.

12:51.537 --> 12:54.139
In case we're gonna consider
a trade,

12:54.141 --> 12:56.407
I want you to check out
these locations.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.376
Sight lines, sniper spots,
the works.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.912
- Are you considering
negotiating?

13:00.914 --> 13:01.913
- Just check it out.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.015
- Okay.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.454
- Hey, voight.
- Hmm?

13:09.456 --> 13:12.323
- I was wrong with ruzek.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.492
- Yeah, he certainly ain't
his father's son.

13:14.494 --> 13:18.129
- Yeah,
it was a gut call.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.099
I was wrong, so I'm gonna
send him back to the academy.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.869
- Your gut's always been smarter
than you, alvin.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.037
- [sighs]

13:29.475 --> 13:33.111
- You need more?
Here.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.579
Hey, listen.
Antonio, I want to apologize.

13:34.581 --> 13:38.249
- Save it
for when we get diego back.

13:38.251 --> 13:41.352
- Sure.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.922
So what's your secret, man?
- To?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.257
- Keeping so many cis.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.593
- Never make them testify,
and you never lie to them.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.862
- Sometimes you gotta be
willing to toss a case

13:50.864 --> 13:54.465
To protect an informant.
Hmm?

13:58.103 --> 13:59.904
- 'cause sometimes
when you really need someone,

13:59.906 --> 14:03.474
They're still there for you.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.148
[door chimes]

14:15.221 --> 14:17.622
- Detective dawson,
surprised to see your text.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.023
- Hey, thanks
for hitting me back.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.392
- Hey, what's wrong?
- The usual.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.393
Listen.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.330
You remember ernesto?

14:25.332 --> 14:26.364
He was caught up in the net
when we busted

14:26.366 --> 14:29.067
You were working there.
- Yeah, I remember him.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.602
Curly-haired brunettes.
That was his thing.

14:30.604 --> 14:32.103
- Yeah, well,
he's back on the street.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.104
I need to know
if he's ordered any girls

14:33.106 --> 14:35.874
But what I really want to know
is where he might be flopping.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.275
- I can call around.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.576
- Would you?
- Yeah.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.446
Um...

14:41.448 --> 14:43.648
Can you, you know--

14:43.650 --> 14:45.917
- Yeah, yeah.

14:49.054 --> 14:52.156
- You always played it
straight with me.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.625
- Call me if you get anything.
- Sure.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.226
- I need it fast.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.363
- Okay, okay, I got it.

14:58.365 --> 14:59.464
Hey, you okay?

14:59.466 --> 15:01.566
- This ernesto--

15:01.568 --> 15:04.535
My eight-year-old son
is missing, and he's involved.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.437
So it's important.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.373
- My god,
I'm so sorry.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.375
Hey, listen,
I will call around.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.378
- Thank you, jasmine.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.380
- Hey.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.315
My real name's victoria,
by the way.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.984
- Hmm. I know.

15:24.223 --> 15:27.325
- All right,
put snipers there and there.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.329
And two more snipers
in the windows there.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.698
- Yeah, okay.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.333
- What is it?

15:35.335 --> 15:36.935
- Do you know what percentage
of kidnappings

15:36.937 --> 15:39.304
End in a successful swap?

15:39.306 --> 15:40.371
Less than 1%.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.941
- It's just a contingency.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.009
- Hmm.

15:46.478 --> 15:49.480
- I gotta ask you something.
- Go ahead.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.317
- I saw your file

15:52.319 --> 15:54.385
As one of voight's cis.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.386
- [sighs]

15:55.388 --> 15:59.390
- Did he turn you out?

15:59.392 --> 16:02.427
- He didn't have
to turn me out.

16:02.429 --> 16:06.297
I volunteered
because he saved my life.

16:15.007 --> 16:16.240
[knocking on door]
- yeah.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.242
- Hey, you've got a call holding
on line two.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.243
An erica gradishar?

16:19.245 --> 16:20.445
- I'll call her back.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.446
- She said
it's pretty important.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.515
- I'll call her back.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.584
- Yeah.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.259

16:35.261 --> 16:36.661
- Hey.

16:44.403 --> 16:45.503
- Hey, sorry.
I didn't want to go in there.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.439
- Okay, so I asked around
about ernesto,

16:48.441 --> 16:50.775
And a few girls visited him
and some other colombians

16:50.777 --> 16:52.510
At the polk hotel
on west adams.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.312
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.415

this turns out okay.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.484

17:00.452 --> 17:04.255
- Polk hotel on west adams.

17:06.325 --> 17:07.759
Hey.

17:07.761 --> 17:10.328
Where's this guy's room?

17:40.259 --> 17:42.326

19:25.732 --> 19:29.400
You're looking at life.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.203
But we can say
that pulpo came in,

19:32.205 --> 19:34.639
Threatened you,
and forced you to help them out.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.740
- <i>Abogado.</i>

19:35.742 --> 19:39.177

Eight years old!

19:44.484 --> 19:46.350
Where I'm from,
that's off-limits.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.653

20:01.200 --> 20:02.800

Things aren't going
too well, hmm?

20:27.659 --> 20:29.994
I'm gonna need a private plane
to bogota, to start.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.329
- That's impossible.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.530
- That's just to start.

Need to get your ducks
in a row.

but violent crimes

Has multiple murders
on this guy.

20:51.384 --> 20:55.786
I just don't think you're in
the right head space for this.

- He's in here.

doing here?

21:17.777 --> 21:20.378
- We couldn't sit at home
another minute.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.714
- What's happening?
What do you know?

21:23.716 --> 21:25.283
- Can you guys take
eva and gabriela

21:25.285 --> 21:27.285
Somewhere comfortable,

21:42.869 --> 21:44.802

what have you guys heard?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.704
- Nothing we can say,

21:46.706 --> 21:49.473
Other than the whole cpd
is doing everything it can.

21:57.683 --> 22:01.686
- [crying]

22:10.462 --> 22:14.565
The last thing I told diego
was that he was annoying.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.702
- What was he doing?

22:17.704 --> 22:20.871
- Shooting laser bullets
at me with a lego gun.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.876
- We'll find him,

22:25.878 --> 22:29.647
And he's gonna annoy you
for years to come.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.549
I promise.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.385
- Yeah, I hope so.

22:41.893 --> 22:44.428
- [sniffles]

22:48.367 --> 22:51.035
- Voight's got a different way
of doing things.

22:51.037 --> 22:54.638
- Not your way.
- No.

22:54.640 --> 22:58.609
- But he's got some ideas?

22:58.611 --> 23:01.579
- He has some techniques.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.481
They might help.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.555
- As your wife,

23:11.557 --> 23:14.525
I love the man
that you are.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.795
You are the father
I expect you to be.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.698
Eva and diego see that
every day.

23:23.101 --> 23:26.937
But as a mother...

23:28.039 --> 23:31.542
Do whatever it takes
to bring our son home.

23:42.754 --> 23:45.189
