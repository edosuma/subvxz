WEBVTT

02:19.806 --> 02:23.267
(High-pitched sounds)

03:31.794 --> 03:35.214
Once, far away, light years,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.926
distances beyond thought,

03:38.968 --> 03:43.639
a great, slender ship with a tail of fire

03:43.681 --> 03:45.849
slid through the black reaches of space.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.811
On that ship was Zatine...

03:50.772 --> 03:53.357
a prisoner named Zatine.

03:54.275 --> 03:59.154
Words cannot describe his evil,
his criminality.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.491
He had been captured
by Commander Yaveth,

04:02.533 --> 04:05.244
after decades of search and evasion

04:05.286 --> 04:09.998
in a blood-drenched battle
that claimed hundreds of lives.

04:10.959 --> 04:17.714
But shortly thereafter,
Zatine escaped in a tiny scout craft.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.091
A fantastic escape

04:20.134 --> 04:22.052
from that spaceship.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.181
And soon, he found a hiding place

04:26.891 --> 04:29.685
on the planet Earth.

04:32.981 --> 04:37.985
Zatine was a mutant,
his genes transformed.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.905
A mutant with a primal wish to kill,

04:43.324 --> 04:47.369
but evolved to new psychic
and occult powers.

04:47.412 --> 04:52.040
He used these powers
to spread destruction and death.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.295
In order to find and destroy Zatine,

04:56.337 --> 04:59.131
Commander Yaveth tried many methods.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.386
One of these methods
was an immense army of birds,

05:04.429 --> 05:06.638
trained to hunt and to kill.

05:07.682 --> 05:11.768
But when these birds did discover Zatine,

05:11.811 --> 05:14.896
he transformed himself into an eagle,

05:17.650 --> 05:19.776
and managed to destroy them all...

05:20.778 --> 05:23.322
except for three,

05:23.364 --> 05:28.452
which survived
and wounded him fatally in the brain.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.913
But Zatine, now dead,

05:32.707 --> 05:34.833
lived on in another way.

05:35.626 --> 05:39.713
Before he was killed,
he mated with Earth women,

05:39.756 --> 05:42.382
procreating numerous children

05:42.425 --> 05:46.470
and thereby transmitting his wicked spirit
and evil powers

05:46.512 --> 05:49.306
through new generations.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.852
Yet the struggle continued

05:53.895 --> 05:55.979
and still goes on.

05:56.022 --> 06:00.942
For Yaveth's descendants
pursued the progeny of Zatine

06:01.903 --> 06:08.075
lest their contamination
spread through the cosmos.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.276
Has it happened again?

06:43.319 --> 06:45.695
Her name is Katie Collins

06:46.739 --> 06:48.532
and she will be eight years old.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.224
(Cheering)

07:14.684 --> 07:17.936
San Francisco with the ball, and 1 2-zero.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.125
San Francisco with the basketball
and 92 to 86.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.670
They're going to Abdul,
and they converge on Abdul, in the corner,

07:43.713 --> 07:45.255
and Abdul is down!

07:46.382 --> 07:48.717
We are in the closing moments
of the basketball game,

07:48.759 --> 07:51.970
Abdul, our star, we don't know
if it's a knee or an ankle,

07:52.013 --> 07:55.515
Abdul has been a thorn in the neck
of Atlanta all night long.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.360
They have a two order, what that means,
they'll have new money.

08:07.403 --> 08:10.989
They have possibly some new ball players
like Abdul.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.179
(Crowd chanting)

08:36.432 --> 08:40.184
Both teams are right now
coming back out onto the court.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.812
We're going to have a centre court jump.
Here we go.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.023
By the left...

08:45.066 --> 08:47.317
- And he scores!
- (Cheering)

08:50.821 --> 08:52.697
Woo-hoo!

09:06.087 --> 09:08.171
Setting up that two-one-two offence.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.840
They will try and work the ball
to the high post.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.635
And they do. To Lane, who's shot from 1 5...

09:18.558 --> 09:22.852
Atlanta has scored again,
Abdul still not in the basketball game.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.691
Atlanta has a chance to take the lead.
Prescott past the line...

09:27.733 --> 09:30.360
- And he scores!
- (Cheering)

09:52.508 --> 09:54.593
(Screeching sounds)

09:57.179 --> 09:58.972
We have a time out on the court.

09:59.015 --> 10:02.100
We'll see if we can talk with Ray Armstead,
the owner of the Atlanta team.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.144
- Ray, things are going well tonight.
- Yeah.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.605
You're downplaying how well
the team is doing,

10:06.647 --> 10:08.982
not only tonight, but so far this year - why?

10:09.025 --> 10:11.067
Oh, we've just got a good team.

10:11.110 --> 10:14.904
Well, I'll tell you this. They have done very
well all year, and you have done well,

10:14.947 --> 10:18.241
but we wanna find out what kind of owner
Ray Armstead is going to be.

10:18.284 --> 10:22.078
(Ray) Well, we're gonna change it
from Losersville to Atlanta again.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.664
- How are you going to do that?
- With an open chequebook.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.250
- How open is that going to be, Ray?
- Quite open.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.377
Quite open. Where does
this money come from?

10:29.420 --> 10:32.589
You do not have
a sports ownership bankroll.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.132
Ray, answer me.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.051
There's no answer
I can give you on that one.

10:36.093 --> 10:39.638
You're going to give us an answer.
Where does the money come from?

10:39.680 --> 10:43.183
You say you'll have an open chequebook,
and you say it'll be very open.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.268
Where does the money come from?

10:45.311 --> 10:47.520
Uh, God.

10:57.573 --> 11:00.408
Now, so far, since returning to the lineup,

11:00.451 --> 11:03.828
Abdul has shown no ill effects
of that ankle injury

11:03.871 --> 11:07.874
that sidelined him for a couple of minutes
earlier in the basketball game.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.722
(Booing)

13:15.503 --> 13:17.962
(Woman giggling)

13:18.005 --> 13:22.300
You know, that explosion,
I can't get it out of my mind.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.843
(Man) Which explosion?

13:23.886 --> 13:28.014
The first explosion, one ball,
or the second explosion, two ball?

13:29.683 --> 13:32.393
How come you don't explode
when we're making love?

13:35.314 --> 13:37.065
Where'd that come from?

13:37.107 --> 13:40.652
Well, I'd like it better if you made
a little noise. A lot of noise.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.155
- That's another one of your jokes.
- Can we talk seriously?

13:44.198 --> 13:46.616
We're always talking
about talking about talking.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.369
But we never talk.
Can you talk seriously?

13:49.411 --> 13:51.579
(Giggling) No.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.130
Marry me, Barbara.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.434
I can't.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.522
- We've got to settle this.
- It's settled.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.316
- I can't marry you or anyone, Raymond.
- (Sighs)

14:22.736 --> 14:26.322
It's been seven years.
Seven and a half years, to be exact,

14:26.365 --> 14:28.199
since my divorce.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.579
He was a fine man.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.748
A very fine man, and I loved him very much.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.421
- And I swore then that I'd nev...
- What's the matter with you?

14:42.256 --> 14:44.465
Let us say it.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.509
I'm scared, Raymond.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.308
You treat me like a normal person,
and I thank you for it.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.479
But I'm not a normal person.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.817
There's something...

15:02.860 --> 15:04.903
I can't explain it, Raymond.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.866
There's something wrong inside,
something terrible.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.287
You shouldn't have pushed me this far.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.955
It could mean the end of you and me.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.958
But I know I have to tell you.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.712
Tell me what?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.255
It's Katie.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.591
(Sighs)

15:30.846 --> 15:33.056
No, she scares me, Raymond.

15:35.851 --> 15:38.186
There's something I don't know. She's...

15:39.188 --> 15:42.982
Sh... You don't know,
you can't even imagine.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.109
She's my baby, my little girl, and...

15:46.028 --> 15:48.488
She came out of me. It's not her fault.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.202
She...

16:00.084 --> 16:02.377
(Sighs)

16:02.419 --> 16:05.254
Oh, I don't want any more children,
Raymond.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.507
(Sighs)

16:07.549 --> 16:09.550
Crazy, Barbara.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.602
(Bleeping)

16:30.364 --> 16:33.366
I'll be eight in a few days, Squeaky.

16:33.409 --> 16:37.537
There'll be a big party
and they'll give me a lot of presents.

16:37.579 --> 16:41.207
It was right for now to kill the set of babies.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.043
- (Bird screeches)
- (Gasps)

16:44.086 --> 16:46.713
- Did I scare you?
- (Bleeping)

16:46.755 --> 16:50.258
You deserved it.
You always leave me alone.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.593
And I've always got to play alone.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.473
Here's my baby-sitter.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.600
But one of these evenings...

16:59.643 --> 17:01.686
I'm really gonna kill her.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.646
She's always asleep.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.189
And why aren't you asleep?

17:06.150 --> 17:08.483
You don't love me, Mother.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.069
I know it.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.364
You leave me alone too much.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.907
That's not fair.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.786
I'm tired of it.

17:18.829 --> 17:22.999
And this house is... too big.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.126
(Game bleeping)

17:27.546 --> 17:29.464
And what do you want, honey?

17:29.506 --> 17:31.549
I want a brother.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.641
Have you been to the United States before?

18:21.683 --> 18:23.142
My first time.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.019
What is the purpose of your trip?

18:25.062 --> 18:27.105
I'm a visitor.

18:28.982 --> 18:31.484
I'm a pretty bird.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.236
Glad you love it. I'm taking it.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.154
- Wise purchase, ma'am.
- I'm a pretty bird.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.032
Ooh, hey, wait a minute.
Katie would love this.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.827
- I saw it come on.
- I'm a pretty bird.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.286
Gives me the scary creeps.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.247
- Very nice for Katie.
- (Electronic chirping)

18:44.289 --> 18:45.998
- I'll take it.
- Thank you.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.835
It'll make a nice extra
birthday present for Katie.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.964
- I'm a pretty bird.
- Thank you very much.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.190
Come in.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.910
Raymond.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.746
Are you sure of what you're doing?

21:30.789 --> 21:32.748
Yes. I am.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.835
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

21:51.059 --> 21:53.144
Come in, Raymond.

22:00.861 --> 22:04.572
You're going to have a marvellous team,
Raymond. The best.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.616
It's going to be very easy for you to win now.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.536
Are you pleased with what you have?
Is it what you wanted?

22:10.579 --> 22:12.747
Yes, I am, of course.

22:12.789 --> 22:15.207
Good.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.586
We're in great danger, Raymond.

22:18.628 --> 22:21.589
- The visitor?
- Katie has been designated for that.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.924
Your problem is her mother.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.094
Time is not on our side.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.889
It's on your side.

22:29.931 --> 22:35.102
We realise, Raymond,
that Barbara's resisting strongly.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.771
That she doesn't want more children.

22:36.813 --> 22:40.274
Up to this point, you have failed.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.401
Barbara has refused to marry you.

22:43.487 --> 22:46.238
And for us, this is a very serious matter.

22:47.032 --> 22:50.993
We've always believed that it was not
necessary for you to understand everything.

22:51.036 --> 22:57.708
But now, we feel compelled
to reveal to you our real motive.

22:57.751 --> 23:02.254
Raymond, I'm going to tell you something
of tremendous importance.

23:02.297 --> 23:06.008
But I must warn you that
any mistake on your part now

23:06.051 --> 23:08.511
would have appalling consequences,

23:08.553 --> 23:11.764
both for you and for us.

23:14.768 --> 23:18.062
Barbara is a miracle of nature.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.524
She carries in her womb...

23:22.484 --> 23:25.903
something which transcends
the world of everyday reality.

23:27.030 --> 23:31.492
She is able to give birth
to children of immense powers,

23:32.577 --> 23:34.537
both natural and supernatural.

23:34.579 --> 23:38.040
She is the only woman of this generation

23:38.083 --> 23:40.418
who carries the genes...

23:42.212 --> 23:43.671
of Zatine.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.675
She was assigned to you...

23:49.344 --> 23:52.138
so far, without success.

23:52.180 --> 23:55.850
We wanna do everything in our power
to assist you, Raymond.

23:55.892 --> 23:59.603
And we feel that events in the next few days
will help your mission,

23:59.646 --> 24:02.523
and that you will achieve our intent.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.694
But we've invested a great deal
of time and money in you.

24:06.736 --> 24:09.029
And we cannot wait much longer.

24:09.072 --> 24:12.116
We need another child like Katie.

24:13.618 --> 24:17.913
Barbara must give birth
to a brother for Katie.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.002
Power corrupts, Raymond.

24:23.044 --> 24:26.130
And absolute power corrupts absolutely.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.718
But we must have that power.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.031
(Screeches)

25:00.707 --> 25:04.960
♪ Happy birthday to you

25:05.003 --> 25:09.340
- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

25:09.382 --> 25:14.720

25:14.763 --> 25:20.267

25:28.777 --> 25:31.570
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, darling!

25:31.613 --> 25:33.864
- How beautiful you are!
- Look at the braids!

25:33.907 --> 25:35.741
- I love the braids.
- Oh, how pretty.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.577
- What a pretty birthday girl you are.
- Aww!

25:38.620 --> 25:41.080
- (All talking)
- I'll be right back.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.677
Hello, Squeaky.
Do you like my party?

25:54.719 --> 25:57.054
- (Squawking)
- Hm?

26:00.517 --> 26:02.601
(All cheering)

26:08.316 --> 26:10.693
(Girl) Come and open presents, Katie.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.820
(All talking)

26:12.862 --> 26:15.364
- Baby!
- (Girl) Hey, this looks fun!

26:15.407 --> 26:17.950
(Children) Presents!

26:17.993 --> 26:19.868
From Mommy.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.581
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, dear.

26:23.623 --> 26:27.918
- Oh, what to do!
- (All talking)

26:28.795 --> 26:31.171
(Katie) From Grandma!

26:31.214 --> 26:33.507
From Aunt Susan!

26:33.550 --> 26:35.634
Happy birthday, my sweet.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.722
(All) Where's she going?

26:39.764 --> 26:41.890
(High-pitched sounds)

26:44.769 --> 26:46.854
Wow!

26:48.273 --> 26:50.482
- (Screeching)
- Raaaah!

26:50.525 --> 26:52.484
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, look!

28:06.101 --> 28:07.935
(Screeching)

29:29.726 --> 29:32.311
Here's the bullet, it entered the left flank,

29:32.353 --> 29:35.814
traversed posterior to the left kidney
and entered the spinal canal.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.317
- Will there be paralysis?
- I'm afraid so.

29:40.528 --> 29:42.863
- Permanent?
- In all probability.

30:27.492 --> 30:31.662
Katie. You're doing gymnastics beautifully.

30:31.704 --> 30:34.331
That double twist of yours
was nearly perfect.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.291
I'm getting better.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.171
I'm getting perfect.

30:41.214 --> 30:43.131
I will be perfect.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.261
By the way, how's your mother, Katie?

30:48.346 --> 30:53.058
Well, my mother didn't die, but she
just won't be able to walk any more.

31:36.644 --> 31:38.896
Katie, oh, I've missed you so much.

31:38.938 --> 31:41.064
- Oh, honey.
- I've missed you too.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.774
Well, she's home, now, sweetheart.

31:42.817 --> 31:44.776
You have to be
a very grown-up little lady now.

31:44.819 --> 31:46.653
Your mommy needs
all the help she can get.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.822
Oh, I'll help her.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.033
Raymond and I will both help you.

31:51.075 --> 31:55.162
Oh, well, I'm glad
the two of you get along so well.

31:55.204 --> 31:58.790
Because it looks like the three of us
will be together for a while.

31:59.834 --> 32:05.005
Oh, Mommy! I'm so glad!
Now we'll be a family!

32:05.048 --> 32:07.132
(Siren whooping)

32:09.469 --> 32:11.845
- She had bought a musical bird.
- Uh-huh?

32:11.888 --> 32:16.141
And that is a little, tiny, uh.. metal bird.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.976
You mean like a canary
or a parakeet or...

32:18.019 --> 32:19.061
- A parrot.
- A parrot.

32:19.103 --> 32:22.689
It's a winding. And after you winding it,

32:22.732 --> 32:24.524
- its music come out.
- Mm-hm.

32:25.693 --> 32:31.615
And did you bring it home in,
what, a cage or a box?

32:31.658 --> 32:33.075
It was wrapped.

32:33.117 --> 32:36.536
- Wrapped? What do you mean, wrapped?
- Gift-wrapped, in a box.

32:36.579 --> 32:37.621
Um...

32:37.664 --> 32:39.581
How was the shooting done?

32:39.624 --> 32:41.458
I... I really don't know.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.043
But answer the question.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.461
It happened so fast.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.965
Tell me what happened, I mean exactly.
There was this present that was opened...

33:14.242 --> 33:16.284
- (Clanking)
- Oh, my God, what is that?

33:20.873 --> 33:23.250
Oh!

33:23.292 --> 33:28.130
Excuse me. The door was open,
so I came in. No one answered.

33:28.172 --> 33:32.551
I'm... I am the new housekeeper,
uh, from the agency.

33:32.593 --> 33:34.761
Uh, Jane, Jane Phillips.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.430
(Chuckles)

33:36.472 --> 33:38.390
I'm Barbara, Barbara Collins.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.267
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

33:40.309 --> 33:43.854
Oh, you have such a beautiful house.

33:43.896 --> 33:46.440
- Thank you.
- It's exquisite.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.110
What... what lovely taste!

33:50.153 --> 33:52.154
I...

33:52.196 --> 33:55.115
You know, I bet that you're a Libra.

33:55.158 --> 33:59.828
- Yes.
- And your rising sign is, uh...

33:59.871 --> 34:02.372
- Sagittarius...
- Sagittarius! That's right.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.166
- And your moon is...
- Leo.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.543
I knew it! Leo!

34:06.586 --> 34:09.588
I'm a Leo too.
I knew it, I knew it.

34:09.630 --> 34:12.591
You know, I hate to work
for women who are Virgos.

34:12.632 --> 34:15.052
(Laughs) They're maniacal about neatness.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.721
- Oh.
- And Capricorns.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.431
Capricorns are the worst.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.849
I'm a Capricorn.

34:43.623 --> 34:47.167
- What are these?
- Oh, just a hobby of mine.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.920
Artificial birds.
They make me feel less lonely.

34:50.963 --> 34:53.297
And... I don't know, I think they protect me.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.801
Careful. Squeaky might rip them apart.

34:55.842 --> 34:58.970
And anyway, I don't like them.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.681
- Mrs Collins?
- I do.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.975
Well, Katie, then that's settled, isn't it?

35:04.018 --> 35:05.894
- I'm gonna miss the bus.
- Katie!

35:08.106 --> 35:10.941
Don't you need this
to further your education?

35:13.194 --> 35:15.070
Are you going to be here all the time?

35:15.822 --> 35:18.406
Well, for now, just days.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.951
But it sort of depends on you, doesn't it?

36:12.086 --> 36:14.045
- Wait up!
- Wait up, Anthony!

36:14.088 --> 36:16.089
- Come on!
- Hey, wait up!

36:18.217 --> 36:19.634
Come on, Tommy!

36:19.677 --> 36:21.803
Hey, wait up, Jimmy!

36:36.277 --> 36:38.153
What are you bugging me for?

36:38.196 --> 36:40.739
Ah. Ahem. Well, I... I... I just, uh...

36:40.781 --> 36:43.408
I wanted to talk to you, Katie.

36:43.451 --> 36:47.829
I thought maybe, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to ask you a question.

36:47.872 --> 36:51.791
(Sighs) Yeah. Isn't there something
that you'd like to say to me

36:51.834 --> 36:53.710
that you haven't said before?

36:53.753 --> 36:56.171
- (Sighing) Yeah.
- Eh? What's that?

36:56.214 --> 36:57.923
Go fuck yourself.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.966
Now, wait a minute here.

37:00.009 --> 37:03.303
Now, that's... that's no way
for us to get started, is it?

37:04.597 --> 37:06.056
Hey, look at me.

37:06.098 --> 37:07.766
Now, listen, I could...

37:07.808 --> 37:11.436
I could wait in the car, you know,
until you finish class, is that what you want?

37:11.479 --> 37:13.897
I don't like you. You're a child molester.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.066
I'll bet you do dirty things to children.

37:17.109 --> 37:18.693
You know, I'm worried about you.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.363
Jesus! Everybody's worried about me.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.865
Susan, my Momma, Grandmomma...

37:23.908 --> 37:25.951
They ought to go worry
about themselves.

37:25.993 --> 37:30.330
Warthog, worrywart. Go and worry
about some perverts like you!

37:31.165 --> 37:33.083
I'm smarter than all of you.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.210
Maybe you are. Maybe you are.

37:36.337 --> 37:39.130
But let me tell you what.
Let me ask you just one last question,

37:39.173 --> 37:42.926
and then I promise I won't...
I won't ask you anything else.

37:44.220 --> 37:48.473
What happened to the gift
your aunt gave you for your birthday?

37:49.433 --> 37:51.518
You better write it down.

37:55.856 --> 38:00.193
- (Whispers) Right up your ass.
- (Kids chanting) Katie! Katie! Katie!

38:01.195 --> 38:02.946
(Boy) Katie!

38:10.413 --> 38:12.372
Pat, hi.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.461
(Man) I have a report on the gun.

38:18.504 --> 38:21.464
A real doozy. No prints other than the kid's.

38:21.507 --> 38:24.759
No manufacturer's mark
and no serial number.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.845
- Filed off, huh?
- Never on.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.847
Tests showed negative.

38:28.889 --> 38:31.808
Even the shell casings are anonymous.
Figure that out.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.187
Listen to this. "It is impossible to ascertain

38:36.230 --> 38:39.274
"from examination of the wrapping paper
and accompanying gold seals

38:39.317 --> 38:41.484
"whether the package
was opened and resealed

38:41.527 --> 38:43.403
"before the child in question received..."

38:43.446 --> 38:46.072
That's shit.

38:49.785 --> 38:53.621
You know, we need
a magician on this case.

38:55.082 --> 38:59.878
I want to know how that gun got in that box
and I want to know who put it there.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.507
Well, that rules out the kid.

39:04.550 --> 39:06.885
Where would an eight-year-old kid
get a gun?

39:06.927 --> 39:09.971
And the mother swears that gun
was never in the house.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.893
OK. What about the bird the aunt
said she put in the box?

39:14.935 --> 39:16.561
The shooting was an accident.

39:16.604 --> 39:19.773
I mean, it's gotta be
some kind of wild damn accident.

39:19.815 --> 39:23.526
Yeah. But the gun in the box,
that's a... that's another matter.

39:23.569 --> 39:27.238
Look, Jake, I got a hunch
that we can dig all we want,

39:27.281 --> 39:30.992
and sooner or later, we're going
to have to just close the case.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.036
What about the kid?

39:33.079 --> 39:35.080
She doesn't seem shook up at all.

39:35.122 --> 39:37.499
You... you'd have thought
she would have been.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.876
I swear, she seemed glad it happened.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.922
Yeah, that bugs me, man.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.674
That really bugs me.

40:31.846 --> 40:39.310
(Doorbell rings)

- I'm a pretty bird.

42:22.957 --> 42:25.041
(Screeching)

42:34.760 --> 42:36.427
Inspector one, central despatch.

42:36.470 --> 42:38.471
Inspector one, do you read me?

42:44.728 --> 42:49.023
- (Electronic chirping)
- (Faintly) I'm a pretty bird.

42:52.236 --> 43:02.161
I'm a pretty bird.

43:02.204 --> 43:04.205
(Electronic chirping)

43:07.960 --> 43:10.003
I'm a pretty bird.

43:10.045 --> 43:14.507
- (Electronic chirping)
- I'm a pretty bird.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.593
- (Horn beeps)
- (Tyres screech)

43:18.137 --> 43:20.680
I'm a pretty bird.

43:20.723 --> 43:25.810
- (Electronic chirping)

43:51.587 --> 43:53.338
Inspector one...

44:50.646 --> 44:52.730

44:53.941 --> 44:56.025
Help us get him out of here!

44:56.068 --> 44:58.194
Somebody must be hurt!

44:58.237 --> 45:00.238
We can't reach him!

45:04.451 --> 45:06.744
The tank's gonna blow!
We gotta get outta here!

45:06.787 --> 45:08.746
Get the hell outta here!

45:09.748 --> 45:11.999

46:16.106 --> 46:19.692
to bring children into this bad,
mixed-up world.

46:20.903 --> 46:24.322
Some of them... are confused.

46:24.364 --> 46:28.367
They think that the forces of evil are
stronger than the forces of good.

46:28.410 --> 46:33.372
(Laughs) Is that another one
of your astrological theories?

46:34.124 --> 46:39.253
Mrs Collins, a great philosopher
said that our characters are our fate.

46:40.756 --> 46:46.010
And some scientists now believe that
planets somehow understand this.

46:47.805 --> 46:51.808
You be careful.
You ward off the influences of Saturn.

46:52.684 --> 46:55.144

50:58.722 --> 51:00.806
Baby-sitter?

51:02.851 --> 51:06.353
- The baby-sitter.

51:06.396 --> 51:09.482
- From the agency?
- The home service.

51:10.484 --> 51:12.860
- What happened to Nancy?
- I've no idea.

51:12.903 --> 51:15.237
They... telephoned me and sent me.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.447
Come in.

51:21.661 --> 51:24.371
Excuse my surprise.
We usually get teenage girls.

51:24.414 --> 51:26.707
Well, I'm definitely not that.

51:26.750 --> 51:28.667
This is Katie.

51:31.171 --> 51:34.256
(Barbara) Katie, stop playing with
the elevator. It's not a toy.

51:34.299 --> 51:36.801
Mrs Collins is confined to a wheelchair.

Barbara, this, believe it or not,
is the baby-sitter.

I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

51:48.355 --> 51:50.397
Jerzy Colsowicz.

51:50.440 --> 51:54.068
- Please call me Jerzy.
- I'm Mrs Collins. Nice to meet you.

51:55.237 --> 51:59.156
- Well, I'm ready.
- You look beautiful tonight, Barbara.

51:59.199 --> 52:01.242
Thank you.

52:01.284 --> 52:03.077
Oh. (Chuckles)

52:03.120 --> 52:06.413
And you, young lady, be in bed by 9:30.

52:06.456 --> 52:10.126
Hm? Good night.

52:11.711 --> 52:13.671
(Raymond) A strange guy.

52:13.713 --> 52:16.006
He's got to be the oldest baby-sitter
I've ever seen.

52:16.049 --> 52:18.467
(Barbara) I forgot to tell you,
James said he was coming.

52:18.510 --> 52:20.636
(Raymond) You don't think
he's a child molester?

52:20.679 --> 52:22.805
Oh! Of course not.

52:22.848 --> 52:25.474
The agency screens out their sitters
very well.

52:25.517 --> 52:29.061
What about you?
Aren't you a cripple molester?

52:29.104 --> 52:31.313
Well, I would be if you gave me a chance.

52:32.482 --> 52:34.859
You know, Barbara,
tonight is a very special night.

52:34.901 --> 52:38.696
- I've got a wonderful surprise for you.
- You have? What is it?

52:38.738 --> 52:43.868
Close your eyes.

52:43.910 --> 52:48.497
Now, try to remember...
a very deep part of you.

52:49.708 --> 52:53.127
Another world, another time,
another existence.

52:53.920 --> 52:56.213
Other beings.

52:56.256 --> 52:57.840
(Whispers) Yes.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.093
Yes.

53:02.637 --> 53:04.847
Why did you come here?

53:05.765 --> 53:09.518
Before we get on with the dancing, there's
one final announcement I'd like to make

53:09.561 --> 53:10.978
of a more personal nature.

53:11.021 --> 53:13.230
I feel that we're all one big family.

53:14.107 --> 53:17.985
And I want you to be the first to know that as
soon as we can make the arrangements,

53:18.028 --> 53:21.906
I intend to marry
the lovely Miss Barbara Collins.

53:21.948 --> 53:24.033
(Cheering and applause)

53:27.287 --> 53:29.413
(Bleeping)

53:29.456 --> 53:32.499
- You wanna kill me?
- I don't want to kill you, Katie.

53:32.542 --> 53:35.878
I want to take you away with me
when the time comes.

53:35.921 --> 53:38.631
Only, if you refuse to go...

53:38.673 --> 53:40.507
Why don't you just see if you can do that?

53:40.550 --> 53:42.051
- Right now?
- (Screeches)

53:42.093 --> 53:45.512
When the time comes.
When my friends arrive.

53:45.555 --> 53:49.016
- Your friends?
- Oh, very special friends.

53:49.059 --> 53:50.851
You'll come with me.

53:50.894 --> 53:52.895
I'm beginning to get the hang of this.

54:03.573 --> 54:05.699
I won, I won!

54:05.742 --> 54:08.619
- See?
- You used your powers to make it go faster.

54:08.662 --> 54:12.039
No. No, I didn't. I used the switch.

54:19.589 --> 54:21.799
You want my advice, old man?

54:21.841 --> 54:25.177
- Yes.
- Go back to wherever you came from.

54:25.220 --> 54:27.137
This world is not for you.

54:27.180 --> 54:29.265
It's not for you either, Katie.

54:50.036 --> 54:52.246
Barbara, where the hell
do you think you're going?

54:52.289 --> 54:55.416
Let me go! How could you dare
say a thing like that?

54:55.458 --> 54:57.334
I want my freedom!

54:57.377 --> 54:59.503
Freedom? You know, you can't even walk!

55:20.233 --> 55:24.862
I don't need anybody. Not you or anybody.

55:24.904 --> 55:26.655
Listen, Barbara.

55:26.698 --> 55:31.118
It's not going to get any easier,
as the years go by, to find someone.

55:35.582 --> 55:37.082
Then I'll grow old alone.

55:37.125 --> 55:39.626
No. No, you won't.

55:41.212 --> 55:43.380
I'm going to be right there with you.

55:45.383 --> 55:47.468
Come here.

56:25.548 --> 56:27.633
How did everything go?

56:29.427 --> 56:31.512
Quite all right.

56:31.554 --> 56:33.639
Katie went to bed right on time.

56:33.681 --> 56:36.058
Good. How much do I owe you?

56:37.018 --> 56:40.187
Uh... $1 5.

56:40.230 --> 56:42.940
$5 an hour, agency charges.

56:42.982 --> 56:47.236
She's a remarkable little girl.
You must be, uh, very proud of her.

56:47.278 --> 56:49.655
Yes, I certainly am.

56:49.697 --> 56:51.281
Here you are.

56:53.493 --> 56:55.577
Good night.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.930
"Mommy, you have to marry Raymond.

57:14.973 --> 57:16.890
"You have to marry him.

57:16.933 --> 57:19.476
"I don't want you to be
all alone in this house any more.

57:20.645 --> 57:24.690
"You're selfish, Mommy.
I love you very much.

57:24.732 --> 57:26.650
"Katie."

58:02.979 --> 58:05.063
(Telephone rings)

58:06.232 --> 58:08.442
My God! What are you doing here?

58:08.485 --> 58:10.444
Call for you, Mommy.

58:10.487 --> 58:12.362
Aren't you gonna answer it?

58:12.405 --> 58:14.406
Come on.

58:15.492 --> 58:17.284
(Sighs)

58:18.828 --> 58:20.829
- Hello?
- (Raymond) Barbara?

58:22.081 --> 58:23.999
Oh, it's you, Raymond.

58:24.042 --> 58:27.044
- Are you alone?
- No. Katie's here with me.

58:27.086 --> 58:29.755
Oh, Momma, let me say hi to Raymond.

58:29.797 --> 58:31.882
- Hello, Raymond.
- Hi, Katie.

58:31.925 --> 58:35.219
Yeah. Wouldn't it be great
if we were all here together?

58:35.261 --> 58:38.180
You and Momma could make love
and I would have a baby brother.

58:38.223 --> 58:41.308
Oh! Katie! It's getting so out of hand.

58:41.351 --> 58:43.143
That's not true, Mother.

58:43.186 --> 58:46.021
Raymond, you can talk her into it, can't you?

58:46.064 --> 58:49.358
You know I love the both of you, Katie.
But let me talk to your mother now.

58:49.400 --> 58:52.069
Barbara, I have some very important
business in San Francisco

58:52.111 --> 58:54.696
and I have to leave first thing.

58:54.739 --> 58:56.532
Please. Please.

58:57.742 --> 58:59.743
Come and say goodbye
to me at the airport.

58:59.786 --> 59:03.705
Oh, Raymond.
I feel so confused right now.

59:05.041 --> 59:07.793
I'll think about it.

59:07.835 --> 59:09.169
Good night.

59:09.212 --> 59:11.171
Bye.

59:11.214 --> 59:13.257
(Sighs)

59:13.299 --> 59:15.092
- Mommy?
- Hm?

59:15.134 --> 59:17.386
- Did you read my note?
- Yes.

59:17.428 --> 59:19.263
And I tore it up.

59:20.181 --> 59:22.641
Oh, Momma. You're so beautiful.

59:22.684 --> 59:24.518
(Laughs)

59:55.008 --> 59:57.134
Thomas.

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:15.360
Give me one more chance.

01:00:16.904 --> 01:00:18.530
No.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:20.198
It will be useless, Raymond.

01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:22.743
We were wrong to leave Barbara
in your hands.

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:25.454
She's too strong for you.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.915
She's refused intervention.

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.628
Now...

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:35.380
a more efficient method has been chosen.

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:56.485
If you came to see Raymond off,
you're too late.

01:00:56.527 --> 01:00:58.737
Why, Dr Walker! What are you doing here?

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.284
I came to see my daughter off.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:06.286
She left on the same flight.

01:01:08.956 --> 01:01:11.416
Where did Katie disappear to?

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.794
Here. Let me help you try and find her.

01:01:16.422 --> 01:01:19.925
I'm pleased that we met here by chance
today, Mrs Collins.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.470
You haven't been to see me
these past few weeks.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.264
Well, uh...

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:29.601
It hasn't been easy, Dr Walker,

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.938
adjusting to this whole new way of life.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:35.273
That's exactly why I wanted to see you.

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:39.569
- May I call you Barbara?
- Yes, of course.

01:01:50.915 --> 01:01:53.625
Katie! Why do you do things like that?

01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:57.796
Sometimes I think it gives you some sort
of strange pleasure to see me suffer.

01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:01.800
Mommy, I'm sorry. I just got lost.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:04.386
- Katie.
- Hi.

01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:08.807
Why don't you try and convince your mother
to come over to my house?

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:12.185
(Gasps) Let's go, Mommy!
We're always stuck at home alone.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.939
Dr Walker, I promise that
we'll come another time.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:18.233
But I'm exhausted right now,

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:21.445
and I think it would be better
if Katie and I would go home.

01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:23.363
All right.

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:25.657
We'll let you off this time.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.659
But we'll take a rain check, agreed?

01:02:57.523 --> 01:02:59.608
(Brakes squeal)

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:04.154
- (Engine dies)
- Ah!

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.156
Oh, shit.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:08.283
(Engine stuttering)

01:03:09.827 --> 01:03:12.245
What the hell is wrong with this?

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:17.000
(Deep rumbling)

01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:23.423
(Rumbling continues)

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.759
Mommy? Are you scared?

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:29.054
(Laughs) No! Why should I be?

01:03:29.096 --> 01:03:33.725
They'll probably help us.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.822
Idiot!

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.371
- (Woman) Hello, can I help you?
- Yes.

01:03:55.456 --> 01:04:02.003
My number is 75141 97020.

01:04:02.046 --> 01:04:04.506
Can you give me
your name and location, please?

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:07.175
I'm Mrs Barbara Collins. And, uh...

01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:11.763
We're stalled on Interstate...

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:15.809
I mean, we're stalled on Route 28,

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.228
about 1 5 miles from Interstate 85.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.523
I'll need a description of your car,
Mrs Collins.

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:26.194
Oh! Oh, yes, the car,
it's a blue 1 978 Thunderbird.

01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:28.321
Just a moment, please.

01:04:29.156 --> 01:04:32.450
Our service truck will be there
within 30 minutes.

01:04:32.493 --> 01:04:33.910
Thank you.

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:36.246
They'll be here in a half hour.

01:04:38.082 --> 01:04:40.208
That truck scared you, didn't it?

01:04:41.335 --> 01:04:43.336
No.

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:50.010
- (Rumbling stops)
- Oh, my God. (Gasps)

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:02.314
(Footsteps echoing)

01:05:02.356 --> 01:05:04.274
(Gasps) What the hell is he doing?

01:07:56.864 --> 01:08:00.033
Hey, man.
This don't look so good.

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:02.660
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:08:02.703 --> 01:08:05.830
You know, they've got a lot of crazy mothers
running around out there.

01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:08.083
I know where you're coming from.

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:11.586
Tell you what, we're going
to check this out real quick-like, first.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:14.089
Cos I ain't about to be gettin'
my butt shot off.

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:19.176
Listen, Dizzy. You take this one for yourself.

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:23.680
I've just remembered,
I ain't supposed to be working tonight.

01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:25.558
I'm on unemployment.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.812
Naw, man! You comin' with me.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:30.729
Come on, get your butt outta here, man.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.399
You wanna walk or something?

01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:41.533
Aw, shit.

01:08:41.575 --> 01:08:44.035
It's some old crazy-ass
drunk woman and a kid.

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:49.124
Hey, Momma. We're here to fix your car.

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:52.710
(Katie) My Mommy isn't feeling very well.

01:08:55.171 --> 01:08:57.256
(Loud whooshing)

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.398
(Buzzing)

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:17.819
(Whooshing)

01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:34.711
(Rumbling)

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:38.590
(Noises die down)

01:10:52.206 --> 01:10:54.332
Mrs Collins.

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:58.336
I'm sure you're wondering why I'm here.

01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:00.546
Uh, please hear me out.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:04.467
I'm here to help you, Mrs Collins.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.473
You've been feeling strange
lately, Barbara.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:12.642
Confused.

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:17.730
This confusion has been transmitted to you
from another time, another place,

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:21.943
beyond human knowledge
and understanding.

01:11:24.071 --> 01:11:27.073
There are forces, inhuman ones,

01:11:27.866 --> 01:11:29.617
out of this world.

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.161
And they are unspeakably evil.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:40.086
You are the key
to their power on this planet.

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:43.172
They sought to use you once
in their evil game.

01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:45.883
And they succeeded.

01:11:45.926 --> 01:11:48.303
This will not happen again.

01:11:48.345 --> 01:11:50.305
But you must do exactly as I say.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:53.683
Last night, you were taken by violence.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:55.268
You are pregnant, Barbara.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.562
- (Gasps)
- (Loud screech)

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:07.488
Pregnant with a child conceived
out of their hatred for this world.

01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:11.451
This child must never see the light of day.

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:27.485
Uh... Mrs Coll...

01:13:33.325 --> 01:13:35.368
Mrs Collins...

01:13:44.294 --> 01:13:50.633

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.234
Hello, Mrs Collins.

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:52.737
We haven't seen you around here in ages.

01:14:52.779 --> 01:14:55.531
- Hi, Lucille.
- How you been doing?

01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:57.742
- Fine, thanks. Is the doctor in?

01:14:57.784 --> 01:14:59.785
Why, sure.
I'll tell him you're here.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:01.954
My, don't you look nice?

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:05.082
Doctor? Mrs Collins is here to see you.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:08.044
OK.

01:15:08.086 --> 01:15:09.462
He'll be right out.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.589
(Man) OK, Jimmy. You listen to me.

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:16.093
See what happens when you go playing
out there on that field without your shoes on.

01:15:16.136 --> 01:15:17.929
Never again, huh?

01:15:17.971 --> 01:15:21.390
And I'll tell you something.
As you were a real brave little guy,

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:25.019
I'll see if I can talk your mommy into buying
you an ice cream on the way home.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:27.730
OK? How about four ice creams?

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:31.609
Excuse me, Mrs Moore.
I have to have a word with my ex-wife.

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:42.411
Hi, Barbara.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:45.831
Hello, Sam.

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:47.542
How've you been doing?

01:15:47.584 --> 01:15:49.669
I need to talk to you.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:53.839
OK.

01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:59.095
- Come up to my office.
- Fine.

01:15:59.137 --> 01:16:03.099
Afraid we're a bit overcrowded here.
This is as near to an office as I get.

01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:06.644
- What do you need to talk to me for?
- You're the only one I can trust.

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:09.230
The only one you can trust.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:11.399
Ah, why do you trust me?

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:15.736
I'm just an overworked doctor,
sweating my guts out day and night

01:16:15.779 --> 01:16:17.738
in this under-equipped dump.

01:16:17.781 --> 01:16:20.575
Hell, you wouldn't even
let me into your fancy hospital

01:16:20.617 --> 01:16:23.119
when I tried to visit you after your operation.

01:16:23.161 --> 01:16:26.914
You prefer to be surrounded
by beautiful people who take good care

01:16:26.957 --> 01:16:28.958
- to keep their noses way up...
- Please!

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:31.711
-..above any of the shit down here.
- Please, let me talk.

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:35.298
- The princess has come slumming.
- I'm here because I need help.

01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:37.883
Desperately.

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:40.428
- I need help from you, Sam.
- Now, take it easy, OK?

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.179
- All right? It's all gonna...
- (Sobs)

01:16:42.222 --> 01:16:44.265
Hey, hey, hold it. I'm sorry.

01:16:44.308 --> 01:16:46.225
I'm really sorry.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.436
- Now, what is it? Mm?
- (Sobs)

01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:54.692
Let's hear what it's all about.
Come on. OK?

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:56.819
Tell me, and I promise to do what I can.

01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:58.487
- Well... (Sobbing)
- Yes?

01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:00.823
Evil people are staring at me.

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:05.161
(Gasping) People are watching me.

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:11.584
There are evil people doing things to me.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.711
(Sobbing)

01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:15.212
Now, look, honey...

01:17:16.506 --> 01:17:19.175
Hey, Mom! Mom? Are you home?

01:17:22.679 --> 01:17:25.514
Why are you still here?

01:17:25.557 --> 01:17:27.558
Why, yes, I am.

01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:29.769
Where's my ol' whipping boy?

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:36.567
You will say, "Where is my mother?"

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:38.903
Are you crazy? Where is she?

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:46.744
For once, once in your life,
you will be polite.

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:49.580
Now say it.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:51.707
Say it.

01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:56.253
Where is my mother?

01:17:56.296 --> 01:17:58.214
What have you done with her?

01:17:58.256 --> 01:18:00.341
Why, nothing.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:05.429
Nothing. I've done nothing to protect her,
dear, don't be alarmed.

01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:07.390
God damn you, you tell
me where she is or...

01:18:07.432 --> 01:18:09.600
- Don't you talk to me like that!
- (Screeching)

01:18:09.643 --> 01:18:12.019
How dare you talk to me
or anybody else like that?

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:14.939
I got your number the moment
I walked into this house.

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:19.985
The moment I got here, I recognised you
for what you were.

01:18:22.906 --> 01:18:28.035
You little monster. You see,
unfortunately, I had one of my own.

01:18:28.912 --> 01:18:31.080
I know how to treat them.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.417
So...

01:18:35.585 --> 01:18:37.670
You be careful.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.923
You watch out.

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:42.633
Or you'll be sorry.

01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:46.178
Nowhere, if you really must know
where your mother is...

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:48.806
- (Bird screeching)
- ..she left a while ago.

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:52.852
With a very nice, elderly gentleman.

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:05.698
So, you're pregnant?

01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:08.492
Yes.

01:19:08.535 --> 01:19:12.455
I seem to remember you told me many
times you didn't want any more children.

01:19:12.497 --> 01:19:15.875
I don't. But something
unbelievable happened.

01:19:17.043 --> 01:19:19.628
It all took place without my knowledge.

01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:21.881
I can't have this baby, Sam.

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:24.925
- You've got to help me get rid of it.
- So you want an abortion.

01:19:24.968 --> 01:19:26.761
- Yes.
- And you want me to do it.

01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:28.596
Uh-huh.

01:19:28.638 --> 01:19:30.765
- When?
- Right away.

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:34.101
You quite sure?

01:19:34.978 --> 01:19:37.021
- Yes.
- God.

01:19:37.063 --> 01:19:39.273
Why does everything
have to happen to you?

01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:41.567
Your accident, the wheelchair.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.694
Now you want an abortion.

01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:46.030
The problems with Katie.

01:19:46.072 --> 01:19:47.865
Everything began with Katie.

01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:51.368
I've tried to ignore the whole situation.

01:19:52.245 --> 01:19:54.288
I pretended it didn't exist.

01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:56.373
But that's not possible any more.

01:19:56.416 --> 01:20:00.669
- I know now I've got to do something.
- All right. I'll do what you want.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:05.549
But I'm afraid the rest
will have to be up to you.

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:13.367
(High-pitched sounds)

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.204
(Car horn beeps)

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:12.403
Hey, man, what are you doing here, man?

01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:42.766
(Man) Oh, my God!

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:55.631
Come out, you old bastard. Come out!

01:24:55.673 --> 01:24:57.758
(Whooshing)

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.180
(Bird shrieks)

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:05.307
(Silence)

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:13.899
Where are you, old man?
(Screams) Where are you?

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:16.401
Come out, you bastard! Come out!

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:18.946
Come out. Come out.

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:23.534
Come out!

01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:26.578
Bastard. Bastard!

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:30.874
(Smashing echoes)

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:32.918
Come out!

01:25:35.338 --> 01:25:37.047
(Smashing echoing)

01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:50.185
(Thumping)

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:52.539
- (Click)
- (Gasps)

01:27:14.604 --> 01:27:16.355
(Softly) What is that?

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:36.583
(Gasping)

01:27:45.802 --> 01:27:47.803
- (Screeching)
- (Screams)

01:28:08.408 --> 01:28:10.200
Ah! Help!

01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:12.995
(Yelling and gasping)

01:28:13.037 --> 01:28:15.122
(Screeching)

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.848
(Gasping)

01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:16.975
(Creaking)

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:28.820
(Screams)

01:29:30.406 --> 01:29:32.491
- Mrs Collins.
- (Sobbing)

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:34.618
I've been sent here to protect you.

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:39.414
No one... no one can hurt you any more.

01:29:39.957 --> 01:29:41.750
- (Katie) Play a game!
- Argh!

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:45.462
Aaah! (Screams)

01:29:46.464 --> 01:29:48.340
Aah! Aah!

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:50.217
Uh! Ah!

01:29:50.259 --> 01:29:52.427
(Screams)

01:30:11.322 --> 01:30:13.698
(Whooshing)

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:16.827
Well, Jane, it's... almost over.

01:30:18.204 --> 01:30:20.455
I shall be leaving soon.

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:22.582
- With Katie?
- With Katie.

01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:28.839
Jerzy... where do you go to?

01:30:28.881 --> 01:30:31.550
(Jerzy) My home, where I come from.

01:30:32.718 --> 01:30:35.929
It's a lovely place, beautiful and peaceful.

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:40.183
Beautiful and peaceful.

01:30:42.478 --> 01:30:44.604
- Where would that be?
- Far away.

01:30:44.647 --> 01:30:47.065
Beyond the imagination.

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:51.236
It sounds wonderful.

01:30:53.614 --> 01:30:55.157
Jerzy, I'd like to go with you.

01:30:55.950 --> 01:31:00.036
I'm afraid no one may enter there
except the children.

01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:05.625
I remember.

01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:08.795
But, you know,
I've been around children so long,

01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:11.381
I think there's something
child-like about me.

01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:18.013
I... I've never met a man like you.

01:31:18.055 --> 01:31:19.598
Ever.

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:24.519
You've been of great help to me, Jane.

01:31:24.562 --> 01:31:29.107
Thank you.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.075
(Whooshing)

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:48.418
(Bleeping)

01:31:48.461 --> 01:31:51.796
Let me go now! No!
(Screams) Let me go!

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:53.673
No, no, no!

01:31:53.716 --> 01:31:56.259
No, stop! No! (Screaming)

01:31:58.054 --> 01:32:00.138
(Bleeping)

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:28.875
(Woman) Katie is a very lonely little girl.

01:32:29.752 --> 01:32:33.255
She has a great need to recover
the affection she feels is lacking.

01:32:33.297 --> 01:32:37.008
I don't think she fully realises
what happened, now or then.

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:39.761
I'm afraid she's going
to need extensive therapy.

01:32:39.804 --> 01:32:41.471
There's no telling for how long.

01:32:41.514 --> 01:32:44.766
(Katie) Mommy?
Mommy, I know you're there.

01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:47.727
Please, don't leave me here.

01:32:49.021 --> 01:32:53.149
I'll be good. I'll be good, I promise!

01:32:53.192 --> 01:32:55.902
Take me home, Mommy, please.

01:33:12.712 --> 01:33:14.796
(Whooshing)

01:33:28.978 --> 01:33:31.062
(Buzzing)

01:34:17.693 --> 01:34:19.986
(Whooshing fades)

01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:23.239
(High pitched whirring)

01:34:44.929 --> 01:34:47.013
(Rhythmic bleeping)

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:24.527
(Faint beeping)

01:36:51.514 --> 01:36:53.765
(Katie's game bleeping)

01:37:09.073 --> 01:37:11.366
(Bleeping speeds up)

01:37:42.398 --> 01:37:46.109
Katie? Katie, is that you?

01:37:46.151 --> 01:37:48.027
Answer me.

01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:50.488
Why are you so scared of me, Mommy?

01:37:50.531 --> 01:37:53.867
Why did you leave me
in that terrible place?

01:37:54.869 --> 01:37:57.161
I know I've been really bad lately.

01:37:57.204 --> 01:37:59.330
But that's all over now.

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:02.125
I want to hug you, Mommy.

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:05.753
- I'm sorry.
- (Gasps)

01:38:05.796 --> 01:38:08.047
Please don't be angry any more.

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:11.718
Can I have a kiss?

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.555
Mommy? Can I have a kiss?

01:38:17.433 --> 01:38:19.809
(Roaring)

01:38:19.852 --> 01:38:22.854
Uhhhh! (Screams)

01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:24.981
(Groaning)

01:38:27.276 --> 01:38:29.319
(Screaming)

01:38:37.828 --> 01:38:39.913
(Continues screaming)

01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:42.999
Katie! (Sobbing)

01:38:43.042 --> 01:38:44.792
(Groaning)

01:38:44.835 --> 01:38:47.086
Katie!

01:38:47.129 --> 01:38:50.465
Aah! Stop it! Katie! Aaaah!

01:38:50.507 --> 01:38:53.384
Help! Aaah! Stop it!

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:57.305
Aaah! Katie! Aaah! Katie!

01:38:57.348 --> 01:38:59.432
(Sobbing)

01:39:01.185 --> 01:39:04.270
(Screaming and groaning)

01:39:46.605 --> 01:39:48.314
You've ruined everything.

01:39:51.527 --> 01:39:53.569
You refused intervention.

01:40:02.579 --> 01:40:05.164
- Katie.
- (Gasps)

01:41:37.674 --> 01:41:39.967
(High-pitched sounds)

01:41:47.226 --> 01:41:48.976
(Wings flapping)

01:41:51.855 --> 01:41:53.940
(Screeching)

01:42:22.094 --> 01:42:23.970
No! No!

01:42:24.012 --> 01:42:26.097
(Screaming) No! No!

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.224
- No! No!
- (Birds screeching)

01:42:33.939 --> 01:42:36.941
Go away! No! Aaah!

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:43.656
(Screaming)

01:43:10.392 --> 01:43:14.187
No! No! No, no!

01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:16.689
No, no, no!

01:43:18.609 --> 01:43:20.401
Get away from me!

01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:25.531
Ow! Get away!

01:43:25.574 --> 01:43:27.408
Get away!

01:43:56.188 --> 01:43:58.272
Aaah!

01:43:58.315 --> 01:44:00.399
(Moaning)

01:45:32.451 --> 01:45:35.494
She's become just like the others.

01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:38.247
She thought I wanted to kill her.

01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:40.207
You can't kill children.

01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:42.376
Only the evil part.

01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:46.380
No, that's not war.
