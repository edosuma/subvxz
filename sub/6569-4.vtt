00:29.196 --> 00:31.472
SELINA: Oh, come on, you wrote it,
you can't review it. How are you?

00:31.565 --> 00:33.169
MIKE: I meant that you
read it very inspirationally.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.372
Yeah, thanks a lot. I love Silicon Valley.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.210
I love Silicon Valley!

00:37.538 --> 00:39.882
Yeah! Boy, it's a real can-do attitude.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.850
This is what DC must have been like
under Jefferson,

00:41.909 --> 00:43.047
except that would have been a horse, right?

00:43.143 --> 00:44.087
(BOTH LAUGH)

00:44.177 --> 00:46.885
Yeah. There's a typo on the home page.

00:46.980 --> 00:49.324
She might have a "great sense of density"
for this nation,

00:49.416 --> 00:50.827
but that's not the line we want to push.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.886
- It's up.
- What is... Oh, MeetMeyer?

00:52.986 --> 00:54.090
MeetMeyer.corn.

00:54.187 --> 00:57.396
Everything you wanted to know
about Selina Meyer that we want you to.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.165
You should have changed the name to
MoneyMoneyMoney.gov.

01:00.494 --> 01:04.066
That's right. It's 5,000 a ticket,
and 10,000 to be at the Veep's table.

01:04.164 --> 01:05.768
20,000 and Selina sits on your lap.

01:06.266 --> 01:07.677
- What did you just say?
- No, not really.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.839
So, what about Clovis?
When are we doing that? ls that tomorrow?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.747
Yes. That company is worth 4.3 billion.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.519
- I know.
- That's more than I make in a year.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.179

01:22.015 --> 01:24.086
- Here, can you take this? It's heavy.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:24.184 --> 01:25.720
You take that. Okay, this way?

01:25.786 --> 01:28.232
Wi-Fi. Do you have that in Silicon Valley?

01:33.193 --> 01:34.763
I call that an ussy.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.598
It's an iPhone joke or something.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.472

01:38.565 --> 01:40.545
- This is Gracie.

- She's wearing a campaign button, folks.
- (MIKE CHUCKLES)

01:42.569 --> 01:44.207
- Well, I campaigned for you.
- You did?

01:44.271 --> 01:45.443
Yeah, Cassie Langley.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.951
I can't resist a baby. Hello, Gracie.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.654
- Now, how old is she?
- I'd say she's eight and a half months.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.314
- She's nine months.
- Okay' she's rounding up.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.289
She's crawling. Isn't that about the age...

01:54.381 --> 01:57.225
No, she's been really,
really slow to develop, actually.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.661
They've been fracking in our area.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.663
Hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.927
- You don't know what it is?
- I absolutely know what fracking is.

02:02.990 --> 02:06.062
We just don't know
if there's contamination in our homes.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.502
And when you ran,
you said that you were pro-environment.

02:08.595 --> 02:09.972
- I am pro- environment. Absolutely.
- No, you were.

02:10.062 --> 02:12.669
Now I don't know what you are,
and I feel very, very let down by you.

02:12.766 --> 02:13.972
You know what
your mommy and I are doing?

02:14.067 --> 02:19.141

about political issues, aren't we?

02:19.640 --> 02:22.018
And the issues are complex.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.514
You said you were against it,
now you're saying you're for it.

02:24.611 --> 02:25.851
I'm just confused. Which one is it?

02:25.946 --> 02:27.823
We need to make that woman go away.

- And I don't mean kill her.
- MIKE: Kill her.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.326
...who believe that a certain kind of fracking...

02:31.418 --> 02:32.920
I don't think that
you know what you are talking about.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.659
I care about my daughter very much...

- KENT: Wrap it up.
- I'm trying.

SELINA: I believe that children
are our future, Cassie.

02:38.125 --> 02:42.972

and you were nowhere
to push her back in the sea.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.661
I was shutting it down, Amy. Meanwhile,
you were watching a baby fill its diaper.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.291

like its mama.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.064

- Uh-huh.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.174
- You know what trim is?
- Yeah?

03:17.230 --> 03:18.675
- It's twat.
- Oh, yeah.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.234
So, ma'am, right now, you're at your hotel.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.212
- I know that, yes.
- What about this one, Alcatraz-matazz?

03:23.303 --> 03:25.146
- What do you think of that?
- They look like two couches.

See, that's wrong. That's too young.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.922
No, you shouldn't make
your first million until you're in your 30s.

That's what Andrew and I did.
It kept us completely grounded.

- C-R-A-I-G.
- Yeah, that's right.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.846
- Craig?
- No, Cray-eeg.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.245
- Cray-eeg.
- Very close.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.546
Gray-eeg.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.882
- That's it. Well done, Amy.
- Oh, okay.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.253
SELINA: You got it right, Ah-mee.

09:06.346 --> 09:09.020
MELISSA: We have gyms and restaurants,

09:09.082 --> 09:12.655
entertainment facilities for the creatives.
Sleeping pods...

09:12.752 --> 09:14.698
Oh, how wonderful.

09:14.754 --> 09:17.428
Child care is a huge part of my campaign.

09:17.524 --> 09:18.901
Oh, no, these are Legos.

09:18.992 --> 09:22.906
Craig believes that Legos
are an important part of creative thought.

09:23.763 --> 09:26.334
Wow, and what are you making, Kent?

09:26.699 --> 09:28.440
Are you making a friend for the robot, huh?

09:28.535 --> 09:30.572
No, I think they're onto something here.

09:30.670 --> 09:31.944
We should have this stuff up on the Hill.

09:32.038 --> 09:33.881
- We could build a consensus.
- All right.

09:34.707 --> 09:37.347
<i>So, the Veep's gone to Silicon Valley
of the Dolls...</i>

09:37.710 --> 09:40.350
Will someone please either kill the sound
or kill that idiot?

09:40.413 --> 09:43.360
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
Back on. Now. Idiot.

09:43.583 --> 09:47.190
Oh, God. My brain feels like
it's being fucking circumcised.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.098
You know what? You, every day,

09:50.190 --> 09:52.261
I want you to remind me
never to go drinking with Ben, all right?

09:52.358 --> 09:54.429
And you,
get me a cheeseburger made of aspirin.

09:54.527 --> 09:55.562
Where are you going, Dan?

09:55.628 --> 09:57.972
I am going to get some air
and then throw up in it.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.200
- All right, the game is Texas Hold 'Em.
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

10:00.266 --> 10:02.075
There are no comfort breaks in this game.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.148
You're gonna sit there
and piss your pants like a man

10:04.237 --> 10:05.272
while I take your money.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.817
You're little. You're big.
Put them in. One-two.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.979
Hey, the Egan has landed.
You look terrible, man.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.920
Yeah. Tone down the exuberance.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.892
I got a hangover worse than the film they
made after The Hangover.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.896
- Fuckin' no!
- Hey, Dan. You actually do look like shit.

10:18.985 --> 10:22.330
Who let him in here? Our weekly poker
game was supposed to be sacrosanct.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.129
Sorry, man. His site has traction.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.761
- My site has traction.
- It was linked on Playbook this morning.

10:26.826 --> 10:30.103
Oh, my God, yeah, did I tell you?
My site was linked on Playbook this morning.

10:30.396 --> 10:33.138
- All right. Just deal 'em up.
- I'm gonna crush you bastards.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.235
Anybody want some fruit salad? I got plenty.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.479
How long is Craig gonna be held up?

10:37.570 --> 10:39.675
Craig will be with us momentarily,

10:39.772 --> 10:41.945
but at present he's in his coding hour.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.612
I imagine that's when he's creating code.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.314
That's what she said, She called it that.

10:45.411 --> 10:47.015
Craig's coding hour is sacred.

10:47.113 --> 10:49.525
It happens every day,
but you don't know when.

10:49.782 --> 10:52.319
SELINA: Perhaps if Craig...
MELISSA: It's Cray-eeg.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.490
...kept some sort of calendar,
then he could write down his schedule.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.431
Then he would know
where he was meant to be.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.798
MELISSA: Noted.
SELINA: Yes.

10:59.425 --> 11:02.668
What is all this writing on that wall?

11:02.762 --> 11:04.503
MELISSA: Oh, this is our graffiti wall.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.838
Perhaps as one of our honored guests,
you'd like to sign it.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.776
SELINA: Oh.
MIKE: Mmm-mmm-mmm.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.709
No, ma'am, that's Ron Jeremy.

11:11.137 --> 11:12.616
I know, he's a great actor.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.547
He was Scar in <i>The Lion King.</i>

11:14.641 --> 11:18.111
That was Jeremy Irons.
Ron Jeremy is a porn legend.

11:18.478 --> 11:21.186
- Oh, here.
- No... Uh, Lance Armstrong.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.227
We're having that one chemically expunged.

11:23.449 --> 11:25.690
AMY: Good idea.
SELINA: So...

11:26.553 --> 11:30.023
- AMY: What are you doing?
- It's like a rollaway.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.330
But there's no wheels.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.633
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

11:38.798 --> 11:40.573
- Gonna raise 100.
- (CHUCKLES)

11:41.067 --> 11:44.139
You got nothing. I know you, you got a tell.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.743
That's your tell, Dan.
That's a William fucking Tell.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.877
It's like an apple sitting
right on your head, Dan.

11:50.977 --> 11:53.389
I can see it. It's plain as day. I call.

11:53.479 --> 11:56.085
See, I got one pretty lady, and, oh, look,

11:56.649 --> 12:00.495
she brought her sister, and hello, honey.

12:01.020 --> 12:04.160
Three pretty ladies,
like Saturday night at Chez Jonah.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.704
And here endeth the lesson, children.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.767
You look like you're gonna heave, man.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.739
I just had a bellyful of Chung this morning.

12:12.699 --> 12:15.179
I don't get it' either. I don't know why
no one's going after that guy.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.682
Because unlike your boss,
his day-to-fuck-up ratio isn't one to one.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.617
At least Selina didn't torture any Iraqis.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.380
Unless she had an Iraqi maid or something.

12:24.911 --> 12:28.290
- That's bullshit.
- No, I heard his unit tenured a guy.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.691
- Seriously?
- I don't know for sure.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.627
- You think that's true?
- I'm not saying anything, okay?

12:33.720 --> 12:35.222
I know nothing.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.031
Wow, it's like the rain forest, isn't it?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.235
- Nature is very important to Clovis.
- Uh-huh.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.937
- Here is some.
- How do you take care of all the roots?

12:49.035 --> 12:50.639
Oh, these are synthetic.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.741
- This is our Black Sky ideas room.
- Uh-huh.

12:53.806 --> 12:57.583
Google has Blue Skies,
but Craig doesn't stop at the atmosphere.

12:57.644 --> 12:58.714
Ah!

12:59.078 --> 13:01.285
- But he stops at meeting me, doesn't he?
- Yes.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.917
In his own motherfucking building.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.962
She said we'd see Craig momentarily.

13:05.051 --> 13:07.725
Our withdrawal from Afghanistan has been
more momentarily than this.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.267
Sorry, guys, my size-of-a-planet bad.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.769
Craig Jergensen, as I live and breathe
in the genius. Kent Davison.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.601
- Selina.
- No, it's "Madam Vice President."

13:15.662 --> 13:18.302
- It's Madam Vice President.
- I'm sorry. Madam Vice President.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.468
- Oh, right.
- Right.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.135
I shouldn't say this
because I majored in math,

13:21.234 --> 13:23.475
but you have my 1,000% attention.

13:23.569 --> 13:26.106
Wow, that's a lot. I'm thrilled to hear that...

13:26.172 --> 13:28.015
Excuse me one moment.
Have you heard from Indonesia?

13:28.107 --> 13:29.313
- They've made a counter.
- Okay.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.820
Hope Melissa's taken care of you.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.584
She's our "financy Nancy,"
but she's cool, sometimes.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.148
I can be cool sometimes.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.285
So what we need to do...

13:37.350 --> 13:39.193
- Oh, um, talk to me.
- AMY: What about?

13:39.285 --> 13:41.265
Anything. Doesn't quite matter.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.668
"Congress," "legislature," words like that.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.599
Yes. Exactly. What about France?

13:45.692 --> 13:48.002
So pretty. The museums are too big.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.835
- They could be smaller.
- That's a great point.

13:49.929 --> 13:52.637
- Did Melissa show you our new baby?
- We won.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.010
- I'm so sorry. What?
- Did she show you the Smartch?

13:55.101 --> 13:56.205
This march?

13:56.302 --> 13:58.213
- Do you have a special little march?
- (PING PONG BALL BOUNCING)

13:58.304 --> 13:59.476
- No.
- No?

13:59.639 --> 14:02.347
- You are going to love this.
- It's a little on the loud side, guys.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.148
How about putting a sock around the ball?

14:08.715 --> 14:10.490
- Oh.
- We're going to put this on you.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.163
You are wearing a smart watch.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.857
Hence, Smartch.

14:14.987 --> 14:17.228
It swaps Clovis profiles
when you shake hands.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.633
If it's a phone and watch, just call it a Fotch.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.194
- Or a Wone.
- (SELINA CHUCKLES)

14:21.294 --> 14:23.365
If you wanted it to bomb.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.071
- Let's shake.
- All right.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.475
- And now it is on.
- Oh.

14:30.169 --> 14:31.204
Oh.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.978
- It worked this morning.
- Okay, one more time.

14:34.073 --> 14:35.984
This way. Uh-oh.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.545
I feel like we're sawing a tree or something.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.392
Now we're milking a cow. (LAUGHS)
Maybe there's an on button.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.052
You know what?
We'll come back to shaking, okay?

14:44.150 --> 14:45.220
- Great.
- Um...

14:45.318 --> 14:47.821
- Why don't you ask it a question?
- Um...

14:47.887 --> 14:50.163
- Can Craig see...
- Selina, you need to say "Smanch."

14:50.223 --> 14:51.702
- It's Madam Vice President.
- I know.

14:51.824 --> 14:52.825
Um...

14:52.892 --> 14:57.841
Okay. Smartch, can you see for Craig...

14:57.897 --> 14:59.205
- It's Cray-eeg.
- It's Cray-eeg.

14:59.265 --> 15:02.439
Cray-eeg... The MeetMeyer website.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.843
FEMALE VOICE: These are the
opening <i>times</i> for Sea World.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.413
You know, this is good.
If things work all the time,

15:08.508 --> 15:09.782
it means we can't make them better.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.948
- We have a saying here at Clovis. Dare to fail.
- (PING PONG BALL BOUNCING)

15:13.179 --> 15:14.590
Then that's a job well done. (CHUCKLES)

15:14.680 --> 15:16.557
Stop playing ping-pong...

15:17.517 --> 15:21.226
...here and go have a great time
somewhere else.

15:22.522 --> 15:26.265
JONAH: Look, if we don't go with this
Chung torture story, someone else will.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.235
We just don't know the facts.

15:28.294 --> 15:30.205
Okay. We put it out there,

15:30.363 --> 15:33.207
and then something will
arrive that backs it up.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.108
That's Journalism 101.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.874
Hey, Dan. It's Jonah.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.779
Hey, do you think I should go with this?

15:39.372 --> 15:41.113
(STAMMERS) I'm probably going to,

15:41.207 --> 15:43.448
but if you think I shouldn't go with it,
just call me back.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.420
Okay? Call me back if I shouldn't go with it.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.149
Okay. Thank you. This is Jonah. Bye.

15:48.981 --> 15:50.961
(SIRENS BLARING IN THE DISTANCE)

15:53.252 --> 15:54.788
He's not calling back. Go with it.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.934
- (KEYS CLACKING)
- Stop.

15:59.325 --> 16:00.804
Yeah.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.741
- Done?
- Done.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.299
(EXHALES)

16:06.732 --> 16:09.235
Ma'am, could I address
the Smartch one more time?

16:09.435 --> 16:11.938
- Oh, yeah.
- At work they call me the tech whisperer.

16:12.238 --> 16:16.118
- No, we don't.
- Smartch, can we see MeetMeyer?

16:16.175 --> 16:17.950
The Smartch learns quickly.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.318
- It's like it has an Asian mother.
- Hmm.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.825
- What...
- What is this?

16:22.915 --> 16:24.121
MIKE: Some college kids made it, ma'am.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.787
It's a comedy thing where they

16:25.852 --> 16:27.991
represent you as meat
and act out news stories.

16:28.087 --> 16:31.500
AMY: It's making fun of our website,
which is MeetMeyer, M-E-E-T.

16:31.824 --> 16:32.996
GARY: Oh, that's me.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.969
What was the site, Meeting Meyer?

16:35.027 --> 16:37.371
Yeah. Uh, Smartch, show us Meeting Meyer.

16:37.463 --> 16:39.670
- No, no! No, Smartch, no!
- What?

16:39.765 --> 16:41.176
- No.
- (GASPS) Oh, my God!

16:41.267 --> 16:42.268
Oh, my God, it's a porn site.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.379
AMY: Okay, okay.
SELINA: Gary, oh, my God.

16:43.469 --> 16:46.006
Now I'm getting fucked harder that way, Gary.
Don't”.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.483
- Engage family filters.
- You have to say Smartch.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.317
Smartch, engage family filters.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.482
All right, it's off. Come down from that.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.960
I am so sorry, Madam Vice President.

16:58.184 --> 17:02.792
If it's any consolation, a porn parody
is a sure sign that you've officially made it.

17:02.955 --> 17:07.028
Um, technically, becoming vice president
could count as making it.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.571
So who was that fucking me?
Was that Jeremy Irons?

17:09.662 --> 17:12.301
- I think you mean Ron Jeremy.
- Whatever.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.208
- It wasn't.
- Okay, this raises another point.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.414
We cannot have this Jonah Ryan
or this fracking story

17:17.502 --> 17:19.540
behind the Veep when she's talking.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.084
Yeah, I can't take it from them, too.

17:21.173 --> 17:23.016
You know? A girl gets tired.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.849
Guys, you're not asking me to pull content.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.721
That's very much against our ethics.

17:27.813 --> 17:31.420
- The political reality is...
- I don't follow politics.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.190
But I do like your
Tablets in the School initiative.

17:34.253 --> 17:38.668
How about I give you a few to get you started?
Say, 50,000?

17:38.824 --> 17:41.065
That's a very generous offer.
We appreciate that.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.571
Bang. That's how fast we move here.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.370
Well, that could be
the start of a nice friendship.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.605
Now that we're on the topic of friendship,

17:47.700 --> 17:51.739
that repatriation tax
stops so much innovation.

17:51.837 --> 17:54.408
We would love to have a dialogue about that.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.350
You don't follow politics, I thought.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.080
Or you do now follow politics?

17:58.578 --> 18:01.422
We see ourselves as very much post-tax.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.586
I do have one fiscal question.

18:03.683 --> 18:07.756
Right now, you are showcasing
other people's content for free.

18:07.853 --> 18:10.766
Once the content providers
start charging you,

18:10.856 --> 18:12.631
do you have a plan for that?

18:12.725 --> 18:14.033
I think there's a misunderstanding.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.733
People want to work with us
more than they want to be paid.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.104
That's a given.

18:18.197 --> 18:20.643
Well, if that plan works,
you've changed humanity.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.540

- Yeah, indeed.

- Melissa...
- Craig is bookmarking this chat.

18:27.907 --> 18:31.150
- KENT: He's what?
- You mean metaphorically?

18:31.243 --> 18:34.383
Look at that pile of elbows.
Look at this. Number one.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.053
CRAIG: His site's been blowing up all day.
Who is that guy?

18:37.116 --> 18:38.117
(CHUCKLES)

18:38.217 --> 18:40.754
That's Jonah Ryan. Everybody knows Jonah.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.725
He's well-known in DC circles.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.597
Okay, how much do we have
in the New Venture fund?

18:44.657 --> 18:45.727
50.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.998
Okay, let's take three or four and buy that site.

- KENT: Oh, no way!
- (STAMMERING) You mean millions?

18:50.997 --> 18:52.567
Fair enough. Four to six.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.407
He said he's a popular guy, so...

18:54.467 --> 18:55.741
I didn't say that.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.815
CRAIG: Yes, he definitely said that.
GARY: I didn't say that.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.145
I've got to go talk to Indonesia.

19:00.239 --> 19:02.515

19:04.677 --> 19:07.487
See you at the Town Hall. Gonna be fun.
So glad you support us.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.794
Okay, thanks. Okay, bye.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.765

- It was nobody.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.965
Just a nice little pretty lady
I like to call Destiny.

19:18.024 --> 19:21.028

19:21.694 --> 19:23.935

- What?

19:24.296 --> 19:25.969
Oh, my God. You see these brains?

19:26.032 --> 19:30.037
See why I'm pattin' 'em?
Because they are made of solid platinum.

19:30.136 --> 19:33.310
- This is really good for all of us, right?
- I am going to be so rich.

19:33.372 --> 19:35.147
Oh, my God. You know what?

19:35.207 --> 19:37.710
Everybody who said that
I would never make it,

19:37.810 --> 19:39.949
where the fuck are you now, huh?

19:40.012 --> 19:42.117
Some of them are still in senior positions.

- I vote we tape Gary's mouth closed.
- I did not say anything.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.816
He asked me to come in with him, Jonah did.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.314
I'd be rich right now.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.550
- I'd be handcuffed to a prick, but I'd be rich.
- No, you wouldn't.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.523
You would not. Absolutely not.

20:15.581 --> 20:19.222
What? So they buy it for four,
so that gives you, what, one?

20:19.318 --> 20:21.423
After taxes, it's like 500,000.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.693
It's nothing.
What are you gonna do with that?

20:23.823 --> 20:26.702
- Ow.
- Oh, my God.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.568
Do you think this is appropriate?

20:28.861 --> 20:32.502
'Cause when you do that to the vice president,
this is what happens!

- Amy, can we huddle for a second?
- Yeah.

It's okay, we have a huddle area.

They think they're kings of America.

- Well, in a way they are.
- No, they're not.

Okay. I take your point.

but the sheer positivity of this place

- I'm sorry.

22:32.518 --> 22:35.055
I've got to confess, ma'am,
I've been in a lot of pain lately.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.155
It's my shoulder.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.361
The masseuse at the hotel
this morning told me to take it easy,

22:38.457 --> 22:39.868
- but it's just been hurting.
- BOTH: Oh!

22:39.959 --> 22:42.701
- It was a masseuse.
- That makes total sense now.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.398
Wait. Who did you think it was?

22:44.496 --> 22:46.874
Kent, it was a masseuse.

Ah.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.008
Masseuse. I buy that.

into my hotel room? (LAUGHS)

- SELINA: Well...
- Nothing.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.743
Why are you looking at me like that?

22:56.842 --> 22:59.015
Like what?
Nobody's looking at you in any way.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.216
It's a free country.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.349
- I know it's a free country.
- MIKE: I had a cousin like that.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.358
Not to split hairs or anything,
but it was a man.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.487
So, technically, it's a masseur,
not a masseuse.

23:06.652 --> 23:09.690
- Whatever makes you happy. It doesn't matter.
- I don't understand what's...

23:09.755 --> 23:11.496

KENT: It is, it is.

23:15.828 --> 23:19.742
But my job is to discover how America thinks.

23:19.832 --> 23:24.611

in tax relief for tech firms.

Interesting.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.444
Yeah, but they're still deciding.

There is a lot of interest
in the Chung torture story.

23:33.879 --> 23:38.123
The public may decide
to put it on the Clovis front page after all.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.295
Instead of those Selina stories.

24:51.757 --> 24:55.762
Uh, I know Governor Chung very well

24:55.828 --> 24:59.332
and I can tell you that these allegations
are utterly unfounded.

24:59.431 --> 25:00.501
Utterly unfounded.

25:00.599 --> 25:05.014
If you are telling me
that Danny Chung condones torture,

25:05.104 --> 25:09.610
I am telling you
that those allegations are false.

25:09.708 --> 25:15.124
False. I mean,
the words Danny Chung and torture,

25:15.180 --> 25:18.184
they don't belong in the same sentence.
They don't.

25:18.283 --> 25:21.890
Danny Chung? Torture? Come on.

25:23.055 --> 25:26.468
Well, ma'am, by denying
that Chung and torture are connected,

25:26.558 --> 25:27.696
everyone now seems to think

25:27.793 --> 25:30.740
that, well, Chung and torture are connected.

25:30.829 --> 25:33.708
And I wonder what magician
got that little story out there?

25:35.167 --> 25:36.669

25:39.371 --> 25:42.978

25:43.042 --> 25:44.817
and I'm a grown-up.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.479
I don't think I'm the right fit here.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.686
I wasn't even that into toys when I was a kid.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.393
The Veep doesn't value you.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.430
She's about to promote me
to campaign manager.

25:54.520 --> 25:55.931
She values me.

25:56.021 --> 25:58.001
That's off the record, by the way.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.097
I don't need you.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.167
I can buy 1,000 Amys.

is Jonah Ryan.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.742
- Screw you, Dan.
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

27:12.898 --> 27:14.900
Speaking of screwed,
I heard you lost $4 million.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.310
- Yeah.
- I feel your pain, buddy.

- Our pleasure.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.152
Yes. Absolutely.
Amy, can I talk to you just briefly?

27:29.248 --> 27:32.752
In the ladies' restroom,
they have some sort of an Internet toilet.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.422
I couldn't figure out how to flush it.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.329
It's got all these buttons that freak me out,

27:36.421 --> 27:37.923
so can you go handle that? Okay.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.027
It's the third stall. Thank you.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.129
Oh.
