WEBVTT

00:05.547 --> 00:06.881
(bell dings)

00:10.760 --> 00:13.888
-Hi, Andy.
-How you doing? What'd you decide?

00:14.472 --> 00:16.099
First, we got to set some ground rules.

00:16.182 --> 00:18.852
(chuckles) You got the wrong idea, Harry.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.812
You don't want to say it
like a little prince,

00:20.895 --> 00:23.148
and you will do this
and you won't do that.

00:23.231 --> 00:26.026
You wanna listen to what these people need

00:26.109 --> 00:27.819
and hope you can do it for them.

00:27.902 --> 00:28.903
What do they need?

00:32.824 --> 00:35.994
That's some, uh, evidence
that they want cleared

00:36.077 --> 00:37.245
some dope.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.126
-What? They want me to steal it?
-No, you just take the tag off.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.711
Put it on some quinine or something.

00:44.794 --> 00:46.296
Make it look like they busted cut.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.339
I don't know, Andy.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.507
You don't know?

00:50.258 --> 00:51.468
(chuckles)

00:51.551 --> 00:54.846
I can sell what you owe me to the shylocks
for 40 cents on the dollar.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.556
Now you're paying three points a week,

00:56.639 --> 00:58.767
and when you miss,
you get your butt kicked.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.395
I got to decide. I'm not sure.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.315
Today. Otherwise, it's going to the lab.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.234
Mr. Big Shot.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.529
Mr. Gambler.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.908
Mr. Policeman.

01:20.580 --> 01:24.667
Today, the victims' aid program
will run out of city court.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.045
That means that when filing
an incident report

01:27.128 --> 01:28.546
in which no arrest has been made,

01:28.630 --> 01:31.216
you no longer fill out the magenta 11's.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.426
The victim applies for aid himself.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.512
But when you do make a bust, however,

01:35.595 --> 01:37.764
instead of turning them in at precinct,

01:37.847 --> 01:41.851
you now attach the magenta 11's
directly to the arrest report

01:41.935 --> 01:43.603
when filing at arraignment.

01:43.686 --> 01:47.107
We got that? Officer Renko?

01:47.190 --> 01:48.483
Um, yes, sir.

01:48.566 --> 01:51.861
So you're gonna file
your magenta 11's where?

01:53.363 --> 01:55.615
Uh, under those circumstances,

01:55.698 --> 01:58.952
the magenta 11 would be
a victim orientated...

01:59.035 --> 01:59.869
(laughter)

01:59.953 --> 02:02.330
JABLONSKI: That's right,
but where's it gonna go?

02:03.289 --> 02:04.874
(coughs) The city court.

02:04.958 --> 02:05.834
City court.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.211
Thank you, the both of you.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.005
Item nine.

02:11.089 --> 02:15.176
Captain Furillo's at the breakfast
for retiring Captain Eastland

02:15.260 --> 02:18.138
and Captain-designate Ray Calletano.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.390
Lieutenant Calletano's replacement

02:20.473 --> 02:21.724
begins his tour tomorrow.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.352
He's on orientation transfer until then.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.229
His name is Lieutenant Norman Buntz.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.272
He's from the Heights.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.357
Lieutenant Buntz is back-left of the room.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.984
(applause)

02:31.067 --> 02:33.403
Early welcome to the Hill, Lieutenant.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.239
Tomorrow, we'll break out the band.

02:36.322 --> 02:40.368
Oh, incidentally, celebration
for Lieutenant Calletano begins

02:40.451 --> 02:45.456
at 7:15 P.M. prompt
at the Lapa Loma Room, Kubiak Lodge.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.791
(man translating to Spanish)

02:46.875 --> 02:50.211
Yeah, ten. Ten, operations.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.630
Belker, Larue, Washington, Garibaldi

02:52.714 --> 02:55.758
coordinate with Inspector Froebel
from the Hack Bureau.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.594
They're gonna be documenting harassment

02:57.677 --> 03:00.555
of the local gypsy cabs been
serving the Hill for years.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.682
They're being harassed by fleet

03:02.765 --> 03:04.684
and medallion vehicles
who suddenly find out

03:04.767 --> 03:07.187
they've been missing out on
a lot of good business up here.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.398
If they were fleet enough,
we'd never catch them.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.775
Yeah, right.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.821
Also, Lieutenant Goldblume
continues his special assignment

03:16.905 --> 03:19.490
with the state lottery office.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.451
Okay, that's it.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.412
-(indistinct chattering)
Let's have a safe shift. Let's...

03:24.495 --> 03:26.206
Let's go do our jobs.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.293
-Hi.
-Duane Froebel, fellas.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.545
-Yeah, yeah, J.D. Larue.
-Neal Washington.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.714
You and me,
we worked together on some cab heists

03:34.797 --> 03:36.341
five, six years ago.

03:36.424 --> 03:39.177
-Hey, Mick. Mick Belker--
-Duane Froebel. Hack Bureau.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.094
How are you?

03:40.178 --> 03:42.597
Right. I think I remember you.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.018
-There's an embarrassing situation.
-What?

03:47.101 --> 03:49.103
Man's got egg on his face.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.272
(laughs)

03:51.356 --> 03:54.317
-Have you seen Lieutenant Hunter?
-(Washington, indistinct)

03:54.400 --> 03:55.485
Hey, where's Harry at?

03:55.568 --> 03:57.779
You mean "sorry, guys" Garibaldi?

03:57.862 --> 03:58.863
Last couple months,

03:58.947 --> 04:01.115
Harry's been late more often
than Peaches Labanks.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.325
(Washington laughs)

04:03.993 --> 04:07.497
-Hey! Gee. Earth calling lady, huh?
-Oh, I'm terribly sorry!

04:07.580 --> 04:08.873
They just broke into my car.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.459
-I'm all nerves!
-(sighs)

04:11.542 --> 04:14.587
Oh, I made you spill all over your suit.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.839
Please, let me pay for dry cleaning.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.718
They get $1.75 where I go,
without the pants.

04:21.844 --> 04:24.681
-BALLANTINE: Are you all right, sir?
-Gravity boots, Ballantine.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.183
I have decided henceforth
to start my mornings

04:27.267 --> 04:30.311
with an infusion of blood
into the old cranium.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.605
Is that really comfortable, sir?

04:32.689 --> 04:33.898
It's invigorating!

04:33.982 --> 04:36.109
Lubricates the synaptic connections.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.280
-Meet you upstairs then, sir.
-Meet you upstairs, Ballantine.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.656
Unless you want me to stay.

04:41.739 --> 04:45.201
You mean as a spotter?
That's utterly unnecessary.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.494
Okay, then.

04:48.538 --> 04:52.041
(chuckles) The only possible mishap
would be a pipe giving way.

04:52.125 --> 04:56.296
(creaking)

04:56.379 --> 04:58.798
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:58.881 --> 05:01.092
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

05:01.175 --> 05:04.804
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:12.020 --> 05:15.440
(theme music playing)

06:23.299 --> 06:26.427
DANIELS: Keenan findings
are gonna issue this morning, Frank.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.639
Know what this jerk grand jury's got
after four months?

06:29.722 --> 06:31.182
Know what they're gonna announce?

06:31.265 --> 06:32.767
Nothing.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.477
Penny anti-corruption charges

06:34.560 --> 06:37.313
on the six cops we already knew.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.399
Not that any corruption is insignificant.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.818
No indictments in Keenan's killing.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.403
Which, let's face it, Frank.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.446
That's the same as if I had been named.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.033
Listen, I want you to head
a commission of inquiry

06:49.117 --> 06:52.245
into Keenan's death and everything else,
into the whole damn department.

06:52.328 --> 06:55.415
-We've got to put this thing behind us.
-With what kind of authority?

06:56.040 --> 06:58.668
I hadn't thought through all the nuts
and bolts just yet.

06:58.751 --> 07:02.380
To have any teeth, this kind of panel
has to have subpoena power.

07:02.463 --> 07:05.341
Frank, more gratitude, fewer conditions.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.803
I'd also want a free hand
in selecting other members of the panel,

07:08.886 --> 07:11.722
and I want a public pledge
of your cooperation.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.307
You believe the stories?

07:13.391 --> 07:16.561
You think there are four pads
and a bagman at every precinct?

07:16.644 --> 07:19.856
I think that department
morale has never been lower.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.816
Every man is looking
back over his shoulder,

07:21.899 --> 07:23.151
wondering whom to trust.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.320
I also think that if we don't clean house,
somebody's gonna do it for us.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.405
What about Keenan?

07:27.488 --> 07:29.574
-You think I killed Joe Keenan?
-I don't know.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.409
Why, you self-righteous--

07:31.492 --> 07:34.078
I go into this with a clean slate, Chief.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.330
I won't front a public-relations exercise.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.041
You got whatever you need.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.252
I accept.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.671
You come and get me, Furillo.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.884
You get some evidence I'm involved,
you come after me!

07:47.967 --> 07:50.136
If there's evidence,
I won't be asking permission.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.598
-Frank, Chief.
-FURILLO: Ray.

07:53.681 --> 07:57.477
Ray. Great day, long overdue.

07:57.560 --> 08:02.064
(applause)

08:02.148 --> 08:05.651
Over the past six weeks, since the news

08:05.735 --> 08:08.404
that I would be captain
of the Polk Avenue Precinct,

08:08.488 --> 08:11.866
I have spent what spare time I could

08:11.949 --> 08:15.077
getting to know
the officers at my new precinct.

08:16.621 --> 08:20.583
I told Captain Eastland I want to hear
what some of his men have said about him.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.545
"He always stood up for us with downtown."

08:24.629 --> 08:28.466
"He's made our jobs easier
because he does his so well."

08:29.217 --> 08:33.304
"I worked under five captains,
and he's the best, hands down."

08:33.387 --> 08:35.515
I'm honored to introduce

08:35.598 --> 08:37.892
the man whose position I'm taking,

08:38.559 --> 08:40.686
but who I know I cannot replace.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.188
Art Eastland.

08:42.271 --> 08:45.650
(applause)

08:56.619 --> 08:57.745
Thanks, Ray.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.165
Chief, brother officers...

09:04.001 --> 09:07.255
So, why quit five years before mandatory?

09:07.838 --> 09:09.465
I know the rumors.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.259
He's, uh, he's sick.

09:11.759 --> 09:15.054
-He has a babe in Florida.
-(laughter)

09:15.137 --> 09:16.097
I wish.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.935
Truth is, I'm tired of it.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.439
I'm tired with what we've all
been reading in the newspapers

09:25.523 --> 09:30.528
and maybe just a little bit tired
of wondering if any of it's true.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.114
But since I announced,

09:34.407 --> 09:37.159
I've been reminded of
the other side of the coin.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.453
What I've felt for my men

09:39.537 --> 09:42.290
and especially now,
with what I'm hearing so gracious

09:42.373 --> 09:44.083
from Ray Calletano.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.544
I listen to Ray, and I, honest to God,

09:46.627 --> 09:49.130
wonder if I made a mistake.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.466
Maybe I better take a little more time

09:53.551 --> 09:55.636
to think this retirement thing over.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.639
Leave this...

10:00.975 --> 10:02.476
I don't know if I want to go.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.827
GARIBALDI: I'm gonna take
ten minutes, guys.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.537
Hey, where the hell you going, Harry?

10:22.121 --> 10:24.040
I got to pick up a prescription.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.209
Hey, Garibaldi,
you picking up that prescription

10:27.293 --> 10:28.961
to win or across the board?

10:29.045 --> 10:30.338
GARIBALDI: <i>Ha ha, J.D.</i>

10:30.421 --> 10:32.381
Ha ha ha, my butt.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.467
<i>Hey, Harry.</i>

10:36.052 --> 10:36.886
Yeah?

10:36.969 --> 10:39.096
Hey, look, I want you
to put four bucks for me

10:39.180 --> 10:41.265
on the letter "J" to win
in the second race.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.644
<i>-That's the letter "J."</i>
-If I go by an OTB.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.396
Yeah, on your way to the pharmacy.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.858
Kid's getting in trouble, Neal.
I see all the signs.

10:50.941 --> 10:54.195
Mm-hmm. Sounded to me like you
just put down a bet your own self, babe.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.738
That's entirely different.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.824
It's four bucks, and it's on a horse
that I happen to have been following.

10:58.908 --> 10:59.950
BELKER: Hey!

11:06.874 --> 11:09.627
Excuse me. You just cut in front of me.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.713
-You did, right here. You took my spot.
-Go write your congressman.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.007
MAN: Need a cab, Mack? Mack, cab?

11:15.841 --> 11:17.093
Hey, you need a cab?

11:17.176 --> 11:19.095
We don't usually get
the company cabs up here.

11:19.178 --> 11:22.598
-You're gonna start getting them now.
-Hey, you can't take a fare, man.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.187
-Hey!
-Hey, whoa, man.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.732
Call me if you grow, dwarf.
I'll come back and kick your butt.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.488
-J7J-409.
-Can we bust him?

11:37.571 --> 11:38.781
Let's hold off.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.282
He just drove into my car.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.910
Plus verbal abuse, calling you a dwarf.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.538
I want heavy harassment, though,
before we make our move.

11:45.621 --> 11:46.914
(growls)

11:46.997 --> 11:50.209
Dog's life, eh, Detective? (laughs)

11:50.292 --> 11:52.878
(siren wailing)

11:55.589 --> 11:57.174
Pull over, stupid.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.844
It's not even coming up hot.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.387
You believe this jerk?

12:02.972 --> 12:04.765
It's registered Leona Cleveland.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.851
You're kidding me. Are you serious?

12:06.934 --> 12:09.103
That's Ozzie's wife.
That's the mayor's wife.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.230
She probably doesn't know it's stolen yet.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.733
We're gonna do ourselves
some good on this one, Luce.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.701
Alright, freeze, buddy! Freeze!

12:25.661 --> 12:26.954
Alright, just take it easy.

12:27.037 --> 12:27.997
Oh god, kill me.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.832
Nobody's gonna kill you now.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.543
You feel like anything's broken?

12:32.626 --> 12:34.253
-Hey.
-No.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.172
Alright, now just get up real easy.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.798
Put your hands behind your back.

12:38.716 --> 12:39.759
You alright?

12:41.385 --> 12:42.511
Yeah.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.055
Alright, just take it easy.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.390
Joe?

12:46.474 --> 12:48.142
He's Lee Cleveland.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.143
What?

12:49.226 --> 12:51.395
He's Lee Cleveland.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.731
-Does the picture match?
-Yeah.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.819
Hey, Lee, you related to Leona Cleveland?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.529
It's my mother.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.072
Your father's the mayor, right?

13:02.948 --> 13:04.033
Yeah.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.244
It's your bust, Sarge.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.128
You almost give me a heart attack
jumping in front of our unit like that.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.088
I wouldn't be doing that again
if I were you.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.591
-I'm sorry.
-In the back, this one?

13:20.674 --> 13:21.759
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.637
-Yep.
-Him.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.514
Alright, just step over here.

13:26.597 --> 13:29.683
This man said you took something
from his store across the street there.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.062
-Ain't you guys got nothing better to do?
-You just be quiet till my partner…

13:33.145 --> 13:35.856
-Why you rob from me?
-How come you rob from the neighborhood?

13:35.940 --> 13:38.567
I never rob. What's wrong with you?

13:38.651 --> 13:41.028
-Man, you rob with your prices.
-What he steal?

13:41.111 --> 13:42.238
Fruit.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.364
Fruit?

13:43.447 --> 13:46.867
They take all the time. You make bust.

13:47.701 --> 13:49.703
Listen, sir, if we do that,

13:49.787 --> 13:51.497
you got to come down to the court, and--

13:51.580 --> 13:53.332
I come. No more.

13:53.415 --> 13:56.085
Yeah, sure. You got 50 relatives
working that rat hole.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.294
You shut up.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.880
Hey, what you want, man, huh?
What you want? A lousy quarter?

13:59.964 --> 14:02.216
-Wait a minute. Mr., uh, Mr. what?
-Pak.

14:02.299 --> 14:05.177
Mr. Pak, you want this boy here
to make restitution right now?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.304
No, you make bust.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.973
I only store on block.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.933
No one else have store, so they rob me.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.978
We're gonna have to arrest you.
Are you charging anyone else?

14:14.061 --> 14:15.479
They take other times.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.858
No, I mean now. All right, let's go.

14:20.276 --> 14:23.070
-Yo, Jody, tell my grandma where I'm at.
-Yeah, man.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.823
Here. Fruit he stole.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.201
Looky here, Bobby. Got evidence.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.286
He stole!

14:30.369 --> 14:32.580
Yeah, I know he stole. We make bust.

14:35.958 --> 14:40.337
Ray, Art Eastland was reacting
to the emotion of the moment.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.632
Why did I have to say
all those nice things about him?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.135
You weren't going to assume command
until Monday anyway,

14:46.218 --> 14:49.430
and he's going to decide by the end
of the day, so try to take it easy.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.349
Captain, mayor's son's been busted.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.935
-I heard.
-Cleveland's office has been notified.

14:55.811 --> 14:59.398
Captain Furillo? Norman Buntz.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.442
How are you? Ray Calletano.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.985
How you doing?

15:03.068 --> 15:04.987
Guess I'm taking your oar
in the boat, huh?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.363
You going up on the bridge?

15:06.447 --> 15:08.157
Yes. Excuse me.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.366
Sure.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.995
(sighs) So?

15:13.078 --> 15:15.456
So, you start with us tomorrow?

15:16.081 --> 15:18.959
Yeah, I figured I'd come in
and find out where the john is.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.628
I don't know if you've heard,

15:20.711 --> 15:23.005
but there's a glitch with Ray's promotion.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.299
Captain Eastland
is reconsidering his retirement.

15:25.382 --> 15:28.636
I'm sure it'll all get resolved,
but on the outside chance that Ray stays,

15:28.719 --> 15:30.763
he'll be your senior in command.

15:30.846 --> 15:34.975
Uh-huh. Well, I hope it resolves.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.438
Uh, what do you like to be called?

15:39.521 --> 15:41.941
At the Heights, they called me Guido.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.777
I'm German, see, but I look
like such a guinea.

15:46.654 --> 15:50.449
Or, uh, Norm's good.
How about yourself? Frank?

15:50.532 --> 15:52.451
-Fine.
-Just in here.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.328
I'll give you your rank
in front of the men.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.455
I look forward to working with you, Norm.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.666
Same here, Frank.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.002
Get with Jablonski.
He'll show you the ropes.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.296
Yeah. Is there anything we can do

16:04.380 --> 16:05.923
to nudge Eastland along?

16:06.006 --> 16:08.425
I mean, uh, you know, slash his tires?

16:09.510 --> 16:12.096
No, seriously. Got anything on him?

16:12.930 --> 16:13.847
No.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.898
Trenton, I'm afraid
we're gonna have to book you.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.274
I'll lose my parole.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.276
We'll get you to an afternoon arraignment.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.404
Wait and see how it works out.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.699
I'm gonna go find a khaki officer.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.996
Trenton, what's with all
the blue beret stuff, man?

16:37.079 --> 16:39.999
Well, it's project security, you know,
escort for the elderly.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.752
How many old folks can afford to pay
for getting walked to the bus, man?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.672
Hey, we don't charge!
Look, there's no charge.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.757
You think these people
don't need safety, man?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.926
You think the police
are gonna protect them?

16:51.010 --> 16:54.304
I think that you came out of Correctional
wanting to get your life together.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.098
I saw through to a lot of things up there.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.808
Whatever the good you wanna do, man,

16:57.891 --> 17:01.311
you got to get
your <i>own </i>thing together first.

17:01.395 --> 17:05.024
Look, that Korean's the only store
on 116th street.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.109
You chase him away,
and that ain't gonna do

17:07.192 --> 17:08.861
your old people no good.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.071
Sorry, Bobby,
things are up for grabs today.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.823
-Trenton Moore?
-Yeah.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.326
-Miss Davenport, Lee Cleveland.
-Thanks, Sergeant.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.453
This way, Trenton.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.746
Sergeant Jablonski?

17:20.164 --> 17:22.082
Debbie Craig, personnel sent me.

17:22.624 --> 17:25.210
Will a private attorney
be taking over your case, Lee?

17:26.128 --> 17:26.962
No.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.173
These are all your priors?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.091
Mm-hmm.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.346
Depending on your case report,
I think we stand a good chance

17:36.430 --> 17:38.140
at alternative sentencing.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.143
Would you be willing to enroll
in a detox program?

17:43.312 --> 17:44.188
Lee?

17:46.273 --> 17:48.609
I guess, or die in one.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.741
Is that why you drove
into the side of the bridge?

17:57.159 --> 17:58.619
I don't care if I live.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.955
I lied so many times.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.752
And turn out to be lying
when I say I was gonna quit.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.422
But I was coming home to quit.

18:10.506 --> 18:15.010
(crying) Instead I got high
and went to steal her car.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.222
I can't believe myself no more!

18:20.724 --> 18:22.017
Do you want to stop?

18:23.560 --> 18:26.021
I say so, but I don't know if I mean it.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.649
Maybe this time you do.

18:30.150 --> 18:33.570
Mr. Mayor, what do you plan to do
about your son?

18:33.654 --> 18:34.655
Sergeant.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.157
Mr. Mayor. Excuse me.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.160
Back here, fellas, until you have a pass.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.995
Relax, guys...

18:43.747 --> 18:46.583
I'm here to file a stolen car complaint
against Lee Cleveland.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.043
Yes, sir.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.379
You think with this
Eastland thing up in the air

18:50.462 --> 18:52.047
that it's bad taste to go ahead

18:52.131 --> 18:55.050
-with Ray Calletano's gala tonight?
-I wouldn't think so, Howard.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.553
Our deposit at The Kubiak is refundable

18:58.220 --> 19:00.013
if we cancel by 4:00.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.807
No, no, no. I'd go ahead with it.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.270
Mayor, do you have a minute?

19:06.353 --> 19:07.521
Frank.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.316
I heard Fletcher's announcement
about his new commission.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.361
I'm delighted,
especially that you're heading it.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.529
Thank you.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.823
How big? How many civilians?

19:17.906 --> 19:20.367
Well, I haven't had a chance
to make any firm judgments yet,

19:20.450 --> 19:22.619
but other than somebody
from the D.A.'s office,

19:22.703 --> 19:24.121
I'm not sure there will be any.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.541
You need civilians for credibility, Frank.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.627
It's past the point that the public
will trust this department

19:30.711 --> 19:31.837
to clean its own house.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.547
I'll take that into consideration.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.135
I appreciate your handling this.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.889
You want to see him, Ozzie?

19:42.973 --> 19:46.685
Why? So he can lie to me again?

19:48.353 --> 19:50.189
So he can break our hearts again?

19:53.108 --> 19:54.484
I have a statement to read.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.696
Same horse.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.410
Come here.

20:04.077 --> 20:04.912
Come on!

20:04.995 --> 20:06.121
What?

20:10.417 --> 20:11.793
You know what's going on inside?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.213
I heard rumors.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.050
Listen, I want to bet a horse.
I can't go in there myself.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.636
-Problem with the management?
-Yeah.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.597
Now, listen, I'll give you a sawbuck,
you take the bet in there for me.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.975
Sidney's errand service, at your disposal.

20:29.770 --> 20:35.150
$200 win, $200 place on Heavenly "J."

20:36.318 --> 20:37.861
4-bagger, huh?

20:37.945 --> 20:39.071
We talking fixola here,

20:39.154 --> 20:40.781
we talking chemical encouragement?

20:40.864 --> 20:42.157
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.911
I'll go shopping for you afterwards,
get you anything you want.

20:49.414 --> 20:52.376
(siren wails)

21:02.427 --> 21:03.553
What do you say, Harry?

21:03.637 --> 21:07.099
-Oh. Hey, Andy.
-What's going on?

21:07.182 --> 21:09.101
Did you come over to tell me
what you decided?

21:09.184 --> 21:11.645
Yeah, I wanted to tell you
that I'm thinking about it.

21:13.021 --> 21:15.732
You came over here to tell me
that you're thinking about it?

21:16.900 --> 21:17.818
Yeah.

21:17.901 --> 21:21.154
Because you know you got to fix
that evidence by this afternoon

21:21.238 --> 21:23.073
or doors close
on a lot of different people.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.449
I know.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.620
Anything else you want to tell me?

21:29.538 --> 21:30.872
No, I don't think so.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.917
Bring out Mr. Wonderful!

21:35.711 --> 21:37.462
Oh, man.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.632
-You know what's happening to you, Harry?
-Come on. What is going on here?

21:40.716 --> 21:42.551
You're beginning to run away from reality.

21:42.634 --> 21:46.096
-I try to lay a bet, I get thrown around--
-I mean, otherwise, you'd never think

21:46.179 --> 21:48.515
that we'd let this street slug,

21:48.598 --> 21:51.101
guy hasn't made a $20 bet in 2 weeks,

21:51.184 --> 21:53.228
come in with a $400 play,

21:53.312 --> 21:55.647
and we're not gonna find out
who he's bearding for?

21:55.731 --> 21:58.400
Hey, I've been looking for my spot.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.027
I want to take one last shot, Andy.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.154
You don't have any more shots, pal.

22:02.237 --> 22:03.280
Your quota's up.

22:03.363 --> 22:04.406
Excuse me.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.325
If you're not gonna allow me
to make a bet,

22:06.408 --> 22:07.909
will you please return my currency?

22:07.993 --> 22:09.328
I'll take my trade elsewhere.

22:09.411 --> 22:12.372
Now are you going to do this thing for us?

22:12.456 --> 22:14.958
-Hey, what am I, in a bubble here?
-Alright, alright.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.836
I'll try to do it end of shift.

22:19.254 --> 22:20.297
Okay.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.885
Less $300 you owe me.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.095
Here's $100 for you to walk around.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.723
Let me bet it on that horse.

22:31.558 --> 22:34.186
-You don't want to crash yet, kid?
-Let me bet it.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.188
Come on inside.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.735
Damn Korean shot a man.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.739
HILL: Alright, everybody just step back.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.783
Mr. Pak, let me have the gun.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.247
He rob inside.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.582
My mother...

22:58.085 --> 22:59.878
cleaning fruit there...

22:59.961 --> 23:01.254
tried to stop him.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.174
He come knife for my mother.

23:05.258 --> 23:06.468
I shoot.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.929
You got a permit for this gun?

23:09.721 --> 23:11.807
No permit yet. I apply.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.310
Mr. Pak, listen to me.
You're gonna have to come down.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.229
You understand that? Down to the station.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.234
How is she?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.653
We're gonna take her into the hospital.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.780
Understand? Think she's got a concussion.

23:26.863 --> 23:30.200
(speaking Korean)

23:33.954 --> 23:35.497
He beat my nephew.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.250
I don't shoot till he come
knife for my mother.

23:38.333 --> 23:41.336
-More police will be coming, Mr. Pak.
-Many witness, many.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.089
Tell your nephew
not to open the store back up.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.427
(speaking Korean)

23:49.803 --> 23:52.139
Let's go. Come on.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.474
Hey, Pak, like how it feels now?

23:55.142 --> 23:57.102
That's one man
you're not gonna cheat anymore.

23:57.185 --> 24:00.939
(clamoring)

24:03.150 --> 24:05.152
Alright! Alright! Knock it off right now!

24:05.235 --> 24:06.194
I mean it!

24:07.154 --> 24:09.114
Knock it off right now. Have some respect.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.959
-You're down, J.D., second race.
<i>-Gracias.</i>

24:21.042 --> 24:23.086
Horse has zero chance.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.172
Coffee and a burger, Dottie.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.591
Hey, who's Dr. Garibaldi's selection?

24:27.674 --> 24:30.135
Heavenly "J" by daylight.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.845
LARUE: Letter "A."

24:31.928 --> 24:34.097
Letter "A," right.
Why? Did you look at him?

24:34.181 --> 24:35.682
You gave me your ticket.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.268
Is that right?

24:38.351 --> 24:41.021
$50 win and place, Harry.
Pretty hefty bet.

24:41.104 --> 24:43.315
Well, I told you, the horse can't lose.

24:43.398 --> 24:44.941
No kidding!

24:45.025 --> 24:47.444
Why don't you
come over to my crib later on alright,

24:47.527 --> 24:50.155
and I'll show you
my "Dewey for president" card collection?

24:51.364 --> 24:52.491
Hi, Mick.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.202
Hi! What are you doing here?

24:55.285 --> 24:56.828
Thought I'd look up my B.F.

24:57.370 --> 24:58.914
Your B.F. is glad.

25:01.124 --> 25:02.459
-Sit over here?
-Yeah.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.170
-Did you have lunch?
-No.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.421
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.589
What would you like?

25:07.672 --> 25:09.049
How about some peaches?

25:09.132 --> 25:10.175
You want my peaches?

25:10.258 --> 25:11.384
(laughing) Yeah.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.765
Oh, I made an appointment
with Dr. Hirsh tomorrow.

25:17.557 --> 25:18.558
Why? What's wrong?

25:18.642 --> 25:19.684
Nothing.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.521
I'm late.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.608
What does that mean?
Does that mean you think you're pregnant?

25:26.691 --> 25:30.487
(laughs) It's possible.

25:30.570 --> 25:31.947
You're laughing.

25:32.030 --> 25:35.534
(laughs)

25:35.617 --> 25:37.077
Don't go bing-bong on me, Mick.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.497
I'm not sure.
I'm a little late. I want to find out.

25:41.456 --> 25:43.583
What are we gonna do?

25:45.001 --> 25:46.169
Nothing.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.967
Norman Buntz?

25:52.050 --> 25:53.176
Yeah, right.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.762
And does the next batter swing away?

25:55.845 --> 25:58.807
(chuckles)

26:00.475 --> 26:02.519
He's a regular Milton Berle, huh?

26:05.438 --> 26:06.773
Frank.

26:06.856 --> 26:08.400
-Leona.
-Frank.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.153
I want those charges dropped.

26:14.614 --> 26:15.574
I own that car,

26:15.657 --> 26:17.951
and I don't want my son
charged with car-stealing.

26:18.910 --> 26:22.122
Well, this says that
you have joint ownership--

26:22.205 --> 26:23.790
Never mind that!

26:23.873 --> 26:26.501
Lee says he can get into a detox program

26:26.585 --> 26:29.754
if the car-stealing charges are dropped.
I want them dropped.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.674
You and Ozzie are gonna have
to make that decision together, Leona.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.884
Ozzie won't forgive him!
He's hardened his heart.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.344
He wants to punish Lee.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.138
No, Frank. No, you talk to him.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.056
-I don't think that--
-Ozzie respects you!

26:40.140 --> 26:41.600
I don't think that's my place.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.018
It <i>is </i>your place!

26:43.101 --> 26:45.937
Please! I talked to my son on the phone.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.439
-Alright. Alright.
-Please.

26:47.522 --> 26:49.274
I just want you
to give him another chance.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.735
Okay. It's alright.
I'll try. I'll talk to him. I'll try.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.070
-Just give him another chance.
-(knock on door)

26:54.154 --> 26:57.907
(Leona sobs)

26:57.991 --> 27:01.661
Mrs. Cleveland? I'm Joyce Davenport.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.247
I'll be representing
your son through arraignment.

27:05.415 --> 27:09.210
They want to crucify my son. My husband--

27:09.294 --> 27:11.755
I'm gonna go talk to the mayor right now.

27:11.838 --> 27:13.256
-Sorry.
-Just one moment.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.841
Uh, Frank?

27:15.717 --> 27:17.010
Frank?

27:17.844 --> 27:20.221
Judgment call, but I'd like
to see this kid get a chance.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.307
See if you can push him
down your calendar.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.142
If I can move Ozzie at all,
I'll be in court.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.226
Alright.

27:26.686 --> 27:30.065
Never mind who it is, Captain Eastland.
I just want to put on record.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.484
We're all hearing
it's some kind of popular tidal wave,

27:32.567 --> 27:33.943
and nobody wants you to retire.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.906
Well, I'm one of a whole lot of guys
figured you for over the Hill,

27:37.989 --> 27:39.824
but we're all biting our tongue, you see,

27:39.908 --> 27:42.869
because you were having
the decency of stepping down.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.664
Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.457
Forget all that stuff in the speech, huh?

27:47.540 --> 27:49.751
I'm one of the guys
the lieutenant was talking to.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.671
Then afterwards,
we're all laughing up our sleeves.

27:52.754 --> 27:55.382
We couldn't believe
anybody bought that crapola.

27:56.257 --> 27:59.469
So, uh, come on,
what do you say, Captain, huh?

27:59.552 --> 28:01.554
You had a wonderful, distinguished career.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.265
Now why don't you wake up
and smell the freaking coffee?

28:04.349 --> 28:06.518
And that's with affection
as well as concern.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.356
Hey, Lieutenant!

28:11.981 --> 28:13.316
How about dropping a dime?

28:14.067 --> 28:15.193
What do you mean?

28:15.777 --> 28:17.237
Tell Eastland he's old meat.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.863
Call and tell him he's finished.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.079
I apologize for the intrusion, Ozzie.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.330
What is it?

28:28.248 --> 28:30.625
-Leona's asked me--
-Just stop right there.

28:31.167 --> 28:33.211
She says it's unclear
that the car was stolen.

28:33.294 --> 28:34.421
The car was stolen.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.214
Money was stolen.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.216
So was my watch,

28:38.299 --> 28:41.469
so was the pen my father gave me
when I graduated high school.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.930
But if he has a real desire now to kick--

28:44.013 --> 28:45.432
I'm not asking for special favors

28:45.515 --> 28:48.143
so my son can wind up
high in some shooting gallery.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.562
The idea was that he'd
sign himself into detox.

28:50.645 --> 28:53.106
From which he could also sign himself out!

28:53.940 --> 28:56.443
And rob somebody or worse so he could fix.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.028
Now if he really has a desire to stop,

28:59.612 --> 29:01.239
let him stop in jail.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.618
For god sakes, Frank,
do you think this is easy?

29:06.911 --> 29:07.954
I'm sorry.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.000
(door opens)

29:12.834 --> 29:14.878
-Call my wife, please.
-(door closes)

29:15.628 --> 29:19.048
Bail application for defendant Pak,
Miss Davenport.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.884
DAVENPORT: Free cognizance, your honor.

29:20.967 --> 29:24.095
The police reports are persuasive
as to self-defense.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.765
People are charging
only unlicensed firearm.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.183
No objection.

29:29.225 --> 29:31.478
You're released on recognizance, Mr. Pak.

29:31.561 --> 29:33.396
Your attorney will tell you
when to appear.

29:35.565 --> 29:36.733
(bangs gavel)

29:36.816 --> 29:38.067
Nice shot.

29:38.151 --> 29:42.530
BAILIFF: Docket J93-194,
Trenton Moore, petty larceny.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.949
JUDGE: Grocer in the previous
case is the complainant?

29:45.033 --> 29:46.409
Yes.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.828
Mr. Pak has had a busy day.

29:48.912 --> 29:51.289
Your Honor, this arrest
was for the theft of a pear.

29:51.372 --> 29:53.291
My client offered restitution.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.669
Arresting officers present?

29:57.212 --> 29:58.797
Here, Your Honor.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.716
I did hear the defendant
offer to pay, sir.

30:02.383 --> 30:03.551
In my opinion, Your Honor,

30:03.635 --> 30:06.262
this is not a case
where parole should be violated.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.765
You got an open parole, Mr. Moore.

30:08.848 --> 30:10.517
I was at Witcom Correctional.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.228
I'm gonna follow the recommendation
of the officers here.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.563
Do not notify parole board.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.440
I'm dismissing, Mr. Moore,

30:17.524 --> 30:20.860
but know you do not want to make
a return appearance before me

30:20.944 --> 30:24.489
-for a piece of fruit or anything else.
-Alright.

30:24.572 --> 30:26.991
JUDGE: Adjourned,
in contemplation of dismissal.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.076
(gavel bangs)

30:28.159 --> 30:29.953
BAILIFF: J9-320, Lee Cleveland,

30:30.036 --> 30:33.540
narcotics paraphernalia,
felony theft, reckless operation.

30:33.623 --> 30:34.707
On for bail.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.002
Mr. Cleveland asks permission to enroll

30:38.086 --> 30:40.964
in Springwood Detoxification Program.

30:41.881 --> 30:44.467
The people ask $20,000, Your Honor.

30:45.552 --> 30:50.139
Your Honor, uh, I'd like to say, uh,

30:50.974 --> 30:52.600
I know I have problems.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.938
(gasps) Uh... But, uh...

30:58.064 --> 31:02.443
I've been to my uncle's
in Rockford, trying to kick.

31:03.945 --> 31:08.950
But, uh, I really want to kick.

31:09.951 --> 31:12.620
Uh, but I made a mistake.

31:13.788 --> 31:18.001
And I would ask, um,

31:18.084 --> 31:19.752
if I would be allowed to kick,

31:20.503 --> 31:23.339
because if I could do detox,

31:23.923 --> 31:27.510
then, uh, I'd like to try.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.556
But if I could be brought
down on medication,

31:31.639 --> 31:33.349
I think I...

31:34.100 --> 31:36.644
(groans) Ugh!

31:36.728 --> 31:37.729
Uh...

31:38.938 --> 31:39.981
JUDGE: Alright.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.274
-Ah...
-(gavel bangs)

31:41.357 --> 31:43.818
-I apologize. I apologize.
-Alright. Alright.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.655
$20,000 bond.

31:48.948 --> 31:52.744
Now, Mr. Cleveland,
if that auto-theft charge is dropped,

31:52.827 --> 31:55.538
court would consider a detox enrollment.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.333
I think some apologies
and explanations to family

31:58.416 --> 31:59.834
might be in order, sir.

32:00.501 --> 32:02.045
Well, where they at?

32:02.128 --> 32:05.173
(moans) My mother said
she was gonna try to be here!

32:05.256 --> 32:06.966
(bangs gavel) Call the next case.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.302
Wait a minute! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:09.385 --> 32:11.054
I can't kick like that!

32:11.137 --> 32:12.972
Please, wait a minute! Wait a minute.

32:13.973 --> 32:15.642
Sounds cold to me.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.186
You figure Ozzie ought
to give the kid a medal or what?

32:23.191 --> 32:24.400
Please.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.612
What I am supposed to do?

32:27.695 --> 32:29.113
About what, Mr. Pak?

32:30.657 --> 32:31.741
All hate now.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.368
Isn't that pretty much

32:33.451 --> 32:35.411
how you felt about all of them, Mr. Pak?

32:36.079 --> 32:37.830
I was only angry at who steal.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.540
I don't hate you people.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.001
Well, sir, if that's the case,

32:42.085 --> 32:44.170
then why don't you try
hiring one of them boys

32:44.253 --> 32:47.548
-out of the neighborhood or something?
-Family work in store.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.926
Mr. Pak, don't you see
how that would show people

32:50.009 --> 32:52.345
that you felt you were
part of the community down there?

32:52.428 --> 32:56.307
I think Mr. Pak can make up
his mind on this thing, can't you, sir?

32:56.391 --> 32:57.767
It's a good investment, Mr. Pak.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.189
(bell dings)

33:05.149 --> 33:07.026
You better check out
your own personal cars,

33:07.110 --> 33:09.278
because Medallion's messed
with some of them, man.

33:09.362 --> 33:12.323
What? They mess with my car, they're gonna
be messing with my tire iron.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.701
-What they do?
-They sugared half the tanks.

33:16.661 --> 33:19.247
SOB's put glue in my ignition.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.833
This is enough. Now we got enough to move.

33:26.963 --> 33:29.257
Let me see if your car starts, Detective.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.842
We might be walking home.

33:34.303 --> 33:37.640
Hi! No, I'm fine.

33:37.724 --> 33:40.852
No, I just wanted to ask you something.

33:40.935 --> 33:43.438
I've seen these things advertised

33:43.521 --> 33:47.150
where you could, you know, um...

33:47.233 --> 33:49.944
You <i>could </i>find that out at home

33:50.028 --> 33:52.530
what you'll be asking Dr. Hirsh tomorrow.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.742
Hey, you guys better check your car.

33:55.825 --> 33:58.953
You did? You already bought it?

34:00.663 --> 34:02.373
So will we take it tonight?

34:04.375 --> 34:09.047
Really? Oh, I'm very excited.

34:10.840 --> 34:11.841
I love you.

34:13.676 --> 34:15.178
I'll see you tonight. Bye.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.446
Dispatch said give some gypsies noise.

34:33.529 --> 34:35.656
So I bumped the little guy, that's all.

34:36.365 --> 34:38.868
I don't blow someone up.
I don't care who tells me.

34:38.951 --> 34:40.953
Yeah, got a mind of your own, right, babe?

34:41.037 --> 34:43.289
-Maybe central did it.
-You okay?

34:43.372 --> 34:44.415
Yup.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.252
Captain Eastland just called.

34:48.336 --> 34:50.171
He decided not to change his plans.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.714
He's going to stay retired!

34:51.798 --> 34:55.051
-Well, congratulations, Captain Calletano.
-Congratulations, Captain.

34:55.134 --> 34:56.260
Thank you, Joe.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.846
Thank you. Excuse me,
I have to call my wife.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.139
Thank you.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.849
MAN: Congratulations, Captain.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.268
Shouldn't Detective Mayo sign in, too?

35:04.352 --> 35:08.648
Ah, Detective Mayo transferred
to midtown, Miss Craig.

35:08.731 --> 35:11.692
Could you initial here, please,
that you went in by yourself?

35:13.569 --> 35:14.612
Okay.

35:32.588 --> 35:33.631
Thank you.

35:38.052 --> 35:39.428
We a team?

35:39.512 --> 35:41.013
I'm supposed to stay here.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.432
(chuckles) You know something?

35:43.516 --> 35:44.934
Now I'm getting a little frosted.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.603
See, I got to inventory
this stuff for testimony.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.606
I don't feel like having you giving me
the greasy eyeball while I do it.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.859
Look, I'm new. They said go by the regs.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.695
Yeah. Well, this is the real world, kid.

35:55.778 --> 35:57.113
And the regs out here are

35:57.196 --> 35:59.407
you give some slack
when somebody asks you.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.786
Return the envelope to me.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.289
Okay.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.178
(exhales)

36:34.817 --> 36:37.361
I didn't feel like doing it.
Maybe I'll do it another time.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.155
Could you wait while I check it against--

36:39.238 --> 36:41.032
It's all there. It all checks out.

36:46.078 --> 36:47.121
Garibaldi.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.582
You better hock your crystal ball.

36:49.665 --> 36:53.252
-What's up?
-My horse won. Paid 28 bucks.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.629
Congratulations.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.591
How deep are you in, Harry?

36:58.674 --> 37:00.051
They got you stuck pretty good.

37:00.968 --> 37:02.261
Who says I'm stuck at all?

37:02.345 --> 37:04.722
I don't figure a guy
bets half his take-home to get ahead.

37:04.805 --> 37:06.432
I figure he's looking to get even.

37:08.100 --> 37:11.270
Uh, I'm stuck pretty bad.

37:12.146 --> 37:13.689
Don't even know how it happened.

37:13.773 --> 37:14.857
Okay.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.776
I've been around this block.

37:16.859 --> 37:18.277
Whatever got you into it,

37:18.361 --> 37:20.947
what you're doing is
chasing good money after bad.

37:22.448 --> 37:23.824
Listen, J.D., if you been here,

37:23.908 --> 37:26.285
then you know this whole
conversation's a waste of time.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.287
WASHINGTON: Hey, ready, lover?

37:28.371 --> 37:30.373
You don't have to touch bottom, man.

37:30.456 --> 37:32.959
Hey, yo, Harry, want to ride
over to Kubiak with us?

37:34.710 --> 37:36.170
No, thanks. I got to meet someone.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.713
Maybe I'll see you over there.

37:39.882 --> 37:42.718
-I understand it was your Chevy, Mick.
-Yep.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.221
I understand that Froebel fellow
just got blowed to bits.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.639
Correct.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.474
It's got to be top five.
What do you think?

37:48.557 --> 37:50.268
-Which?
-Worst ways to croak.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.353
Blown into 80 different pieces like that.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.397
That ain't the worst way.
This way's quick.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.982
It's efficient. You're gone.

37:56.065 --> 37:57.942
-You ain't got time--
-Do not start!

37:59.819 --> 38:01.529
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.990
-Well sir. You, yes sir.
-Mmm.

38:07.451 --> 38:10.288
Oh, please don't croak on me, Mick.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.001
Thanks, Irwin.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.003
I'm calling about the commission.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.546
If you're at all interested,

38:18.629 --> 38:21.215
I'd love to see you
first thing in the morning.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.468
Well, your mother was right, Irwin.

38:24.552 --> 38:25.720
Can't hurt to listen.

38:26.387 --> 38:27.638
Good. See you tomorrow.

38:29.181 --> 38:31.642
Irwin Bernstein for Committee Council.

38:31.726 --> 38:32.893
What do you think?

38:32.977 --> 38:34.895
I think he'll be terrific.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.024
Let's back up a couple of steps, Furillo.

38:38.107 --> 38:40.234
Congratulations on the nifty offer.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.944
Thank you.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.779
You seem to be taking it.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.156
I think I should.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.367
I'm proud of you, Frank.

38:49.618 --> 38:51.329
Isn't this how Kennedy got started?

38:51.412 --> 38:52.663
Kefauver?

38:52.747 --> 38:54.332
Joe McCarthy.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.294
Sure you don't want me
to come with you to The Kubiak?

38:58.377 --> 38:59.712
You hate The Kubiak.

38:59.795 --> 39:01.297
I like Ray, at least.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.010
Ozzie.

39:06.093 --> 39:07.219
Mayor.

39:08.512 --> 39:09.889
I'll meet you at the car.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.185
Now it's done.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.605
Now I want you to prepare
for the consequences.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.357
I don't know what you mean.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.816
My wife bailed him out.

39:21.484 --> 39:23.194
She made our son's bail on the felony.

39:23.277 --> 39:24.987
Did he check into detox?

39:25.071 --> 39:27.656
He's gonna get clean in Rockford.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.116
She took him to the bus!

39:35.331 --> 39:38.334
Now I want you to give
your people a description.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.961
-Why?
-He will get off at the Decker terminal.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.506
He's gonna do whatever
he has to do to get high.

39:43.589 --> 39:45.549
Ozzie, I think I know what you're feeling.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.093
You don't know what I'm feeling.

39:47.176 --> 39:48.594
You don't know the shame,

39:48.677 --> 39:51.764
the sick fear you may be responsible
for hurting innocent people.

39:51.847 --> 39:54.141
I can't have him picked up, Ozzie.

39:54.975 --> 39:56.394
Not without a new crime.

39:56.477 --> 40:00.231
Alright, alright.

40:03.442 --> 40:04.568
I know the streets.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.279
<i>I'll </i>find him.

40:07.363 --> 40:08.531
Ozzie!

40:11.325 --> 40:14.078
(indistinct chattering)

40:18.457 --> 40:20.292
-Ladies and gentlemen...
-(feedback)

40:21.836 --> 40:25.172
RENKO: Talk! Just talk!
Don't talk into it!

40:27.007 --> 40:28.676
Why do we keep coming back to this joint?

40:28.759 --> 40:31.637
(laughter)

40:32.596 --> 40:34.098
Uh... (whistles)

40:34.181 --> 40:37.309
Can I have your attention?
Ray, come up here for a moment?

40:38.811 --> 40:42.648
(cheering, clapping)

40:45.484 --> 40:48.696
Thanks, Henry. Uh... Ray... (coughs)

40:50.781 --> 40:54.493
I would like to read what is inscribed
on this loving cup.

40:54.577 --> 40:56.203
"To Ray Calletano--

40:56.287 --> 40:58.706
worthy in service, loyal in friendship.

40:59.373 --> 41:01.417
Given in gratitude, affection, and respect

41:01.500 --> 41:04.128
by his comrades
at the Hill Street Station,

41:04.962 --> 41:06.464
26 September.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.176
We're gonna miss you, <i>amigo.</i>

41:10.259 --> 41:12.094
-MAN: Yeah!
-Hey, alright.

41:14.555 --> 41:15.681
Cheers!

41:18.142 --> 41:19.935
-Excuse me.
-(clears throat)

41:28.444 --> 41:30.654
-Oh!
-I'm sorry. (chuckles)

41:30.738 --> 41:33.199
Excuse me! I'm sorry.

41:33.282 --> 41:34.825
(sighs) Good evening.

41:34.909 --> 41:36.911
(laughing) Good evening.

41:38.037 --> 41:40.414
Seems to be a celebration in progress.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.666
You're exactly correct.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.211
A colleague of mine has been promoted.

41:45.294 --> 41:47.046
Oh, how delightful.

41:48.631 --> 41:49.673
Yes.

41:50.883 --> 41:51.926
Well...

41:52.009 --> 41:52.927
What?

41:53.469 --> 41:55.763
(laughs nervously)

41:55.846 --> 41:56.972
Sad, isn't it?

41:57.973 --> 41:59.016
What is?

41:59.099 --> 42:03.270
When you want to, uh, grasp a moment

42:03.354 --> 42:05.314
and you don't know how.

42:06.315 --> 42:09.276
(chuckles)

42:09.360 --> 42:10.778
How would you do that?

42:10.861 --> 42:11.946
(laughs)

42:13.989 --> 42:17.326
Just, grasp it.

42:23.958 --> 42:27.378
MAN: Come on!
Shoot the ball. Come on! Shoot it!

42:29.588 --> 42:31.715
Hey, man, now come on!

42:31.799 --> 42:33.217
Put it up! Put it up!

42:37.972 --> 42:40.349
You guys are weak. Weak!

42:41.559 --> 42:43.310
Weak, weak!

42:45.688 --> 42:46.897
Say, Trenton.

42:49.858 --> 42:52.611
Hey, thanks for talking
for me in court this afternoon.

42:53.237 --> 42:54.655
Just called it the way I saw it.

42:55.698 --> 42:56.949
Want to hear something crazy?

42:57.032 --> 42:59.201
Korean put up a "help wanted" sign.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.370
You're kidding.

43:02.288 --> 43:03.455
You gonna apply?

43:03.539 --> 43:04.957
He said I could.

43:05.791 --> 43:07.459
Passed by, he asked if I was gonna.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.003
The thing is, um...

43:10.045 --> 43:11.005
What?

43:11.714 --> 43:13.549
Look, I can't add too good, okay?

43:15.426 --> 43:18.387
Um, why don't I front you
for a calculator?

43:18.470 --> 43:20.681
-Just bring some prices--
-That's not why I told you.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.891
Look, I wasn't looking for charity, okay?

43:22.975 --> 43:26.186
Charity's when you don't
expect to be paid back.

43:29.315 --> 43:30.983
I'll bring in the prices tomorrow.

43:31.775 --> 43:34.695
Okay. Catch you later.

43:34.778 --> 43:37.448
(indistinct chattering)

43:37.531 --> 43:38.657
See you, man.

43:43.245 --> 43:46.624
(siren wails in distance)

44:08.646 --> 44:13.275
(melodramatic music playing)

44:28.040 --> 44:29.249
(laughs)

44:38.759 --> 44:40.511
I wish my mother had lived.

44:41.595 --> 44:45.474
(suspenseful music playing)

45:02.491 --> 45:03.409
Tell me.

45:06.745 --> 45:07.788
I couldn't do it.

45:09.081 --> 45:11.542
Look, you want to sell my note
to the juice guys, fine.

45:11.625 --> 45:12.459
You go ahead.

45:12.543 --> 45:16.380
See, but you're,
you're making a big mistake, Andy.

45:16.463 --> 45:18.173
Because I'm paying every penny.

45:18.924 --> 45:21.343
-You got that right.
-(groans)

45:24.555 --> 45:25.639
(groans)

45:27.808 --> 45:29.518
Meet your banker, Harry.

45:29.601 --> 45:32.521
(panting) What's your problem, pal?

45:33.355 --> 45:35.315
I don't get problems.

45:35.399 --> 45:38.652
I get $200 every Tuesday. Keeps you even.

45:39.862 --> 45:42.239
(panting)

45:45.075 --> 45:48.370
-What's that mean, "It keeps you even"?
-He means it keeps you even, Harry.

45:48.454 --> 45:50.080
Your debt doesn't go up.

45:54.710 --> 45:59.006
No, no good. I'm not paying.

45:59.089 --> 46:01.175
Hey, Harry, you're not that stupid.

46:01.258 --> 46:04.720
Ah, man. Tough guy!

46:05.679 --> 46:07.598
-Big man!
-Judas Priest.

46:07.681 --> 46:09.057
Let's see what you got.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.236
I thought you're such a big shot.

46:21.945 --> 46:23.822
I thought you're such a tough guy.

46:24.531 --> 46:26.283
Alright. Now you guys leave me alone?

46:27.576 --> 46:28.660
Oh!

46:28.744 --> 46:31.330
Damn it. Oh, Louis?

46:31.413 --> 46:32.998
-(grunts)
-ANDY: Louis!

46:33.081 --> 46:35.292
(gasps, pants)

46:37.419 --> 46:38.879
ANDY: What's the matter with you?

46:40.088 --> 46:41.924
LOUIS: He's the man who's got the problem.

46:42.007 --> 46:43.759
ANDY: You crazy?

46:43.842 --> 46:46.011
LOUIS: You're gonna get a lot
of money out of him now.

46:50.724 --> 46:52.351
(groans)

46:52.434 --> 46:54.102
Get in the damn car!

47:00.275 --> 47:03.529
(groaning)

47:05.531 --> 47:09.618
(eerie music playing)

47:18.001 --> 47:21.630
(dramatic music playing)

47:48.365 --> 47:49.741
Officer down.

47:52.536 --> 47:54.580
Officer needs assistance.

48:03.255 --> 48:08.093
(theme music playing)
