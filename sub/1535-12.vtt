WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:04.646
What color would you like to be?

00:04.648 --> 00:07.482
Well, I'd like to be green,
but you know you always take it.

00:07.484 --> 00:08.783
That's not true.

00:08.785 --> 00:10.418
Any color's fine with me.

00:10.420 --> 00:13.721
Yeah, I could be a-a combination
of blue and yellow.

00:14.690 --> 00:16.858
Blue and yellow make green.

00:16.860 --> 00:18.693
Well, then it's settled.

00:20.029 --> 00:21.429
Hi. Ready to go?

00:21.431 --> 00:23.665
Oh, good news, we ordered lunch,

00:23.667 --> 00:26.534
so we can all stay here
and play <i> Lord of the Rings</i> Risk.

00:26.536 --> 00:30.338
Sheldon, we said that we would
play games with you tonight.

00:30.340 --> 00:31.739
Oh, no, we'll still
be playing it tonight--

00:31.741 --> 00:34.375
this game can easily
take eight hours.

00:34.377 --> 00:36.077
Sweetie, you really thought
I'd want to do this?

00:36.079 --> 00:37.645
No.
Well, did you tell him that?

00:37.647 --> 00:40.581
Yes.
Did you say it out loud with words?

00:40.583 --> 00:43.084
No.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.653
I don't want to spend the whole
day playing a board game.

00:45.655 --> 00:47.622
Yeah, well, you may change
your mind when you hear

00:47.624 --> 00:50.024
that this is the
new expanded edition

00:50.026 --> 00:52.260
which contains a more
complete map of Middle Earth,

00:52.262 --> 00:54.529
now including
the Haradwaith Territories.

00:56.999 --> 00:58.699
I will literally
race you to the car.

00:58.701 --> 01:01.802
No, no, no, come on,
don't leave. Just try it.

01:01.804 --> 01:03.571
No. We're always doing
what you guys want.

01:03.573 --> 01:06.073
Just once, it'd be nice
if you did something we wanted.

01:06.075 --> 01:08.910
You want to be green?

01:10.045 --> 01:12.113
You know, they
really have tried to like

01:12.115 --> 01:14.515
a lot of the same stuff we're into.
Yeah, we do game

01:14.517 --> 01:16.817
nights and video game
nights and we watch movies

01:16.819 --> 01:18.085
with director's commentary.

01:18.087 --> 01:20.020
Oh, my favorite--
George Lucas can talk

01:20.022 --> 01:22.123
all the way through
<i>Star Wars,</i> I say one word

01:22.125 --> 01:23.557
and I'm banished
to the kitchen.

01:24.893 --> 01:26.560
Yeah, today Amy and I
are deciding

01:26.562 --> 01:27.728
what we're all gonna do.

01:27.730 --> 01:29.763
You got it, you girls
are in charge.

01:29.765 --> 01:31.732
Thank you.
Sheldon?

01:31.734 --> 01:33.901
Fine.

01:33.903 --> 01:36.303
Now that we're not playing,
you can be green.

01:36.305 --> 01:37.771
Thank you.
And since you're green

01:37.773 --> 01:39.907
this time, I can
be it next time.

01:39.909 --> 01:41.842
All right, let's see.
What's something fun

01:41.844 --> 01:43.877
the guys would
never take us to do?

01:43.879 --> 01:45.679
Oh, I know-- we could
go horseback riding.

01:45.681 --> 01:46.880
I actually can't.

01:46.882 --> 01:50.150
My hips don't open
wider than 22 degrees.

01:51.986 --> 01:55.222
I rode a very
thin pony once.

01:55.224 --> 01:58.659
On the first bump...
just popped right off.

02:00.128 --> 02:01.828
All right, well,
what do you want to do?

02:01.830 --> 02:04.665
There's a craft and folk
art museum on Wilshire.

02:04.667 --> 02:07.134
Well, that's Wilshire's problem.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.469
Come on, you know, there-there's

02:09.471 --> 02:11.605
got to be something fun we could
do that the guys will hate.

02:11.607 --> 02:13.674
Hang on, why do we
have to hate it?

02:13.676 --> 02:16.910
Three words:
<i>Doctor Who</i> convention.

02:16.912 --> 02:19.279
I-I did not force you
to go to that.

02:19.281 --> 02:21.481
You walked out of the house
in a fez and bow tie. I went

02:21.483 --> 02:23.450
so you didn't get beat up.

02:23.452 --> 02:24.985
I wasn't gonna get beat up.

02:24.987 --> 02:28.388
You were, but somehow
I held myself back.

02:28.390 --> 02:30.857
You know what you could
make us do? Ice-skating.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.226
The cold air will trigger
Leonard's asthma

02:33.228 --> 02:35.228
and it plays right into
my well-known fear of

02:35.230 --> 02:38.465
getting flattened by a Zamboni.

02:38.467 --> 02:41.501
Now you're helping them
find ways to make us miserable?

02:41.503 --> 02:45.005
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, I'm a
problem-solver, it's what I do.

02:45.007 --> 02:47.374
I actually can't
go ice-skating.

02:47.376 --> 02:50.744
I have unnaturally
brittle ankles.

02:50.746 --> 02:53.279

Oh, my God, oh, my
God, oh, my God.

03:28.322 --> 03:31.123
Will you please relax?
I can't take it, dude.

03:31.125 --> 03:33.258
You okay?
No, I'm not okay. I feel like

03:33.260 --> 03:35.060
I'm gonna jump out of my skin.

03:35.062 --> 03:37.629
I told you
not to wax down there.

03:38.764 --> 03:43.068
It's itchy when it grows back.

03:43.070 --> 03:46.571
I'm worried about
the New Horizons space probe.

03:46.573 --> 03:47.539
What's he talking about?

03:47.541 --> 03:49.908
Nine years ago
he was part of a team

03:49.910 --> 03:52.177
that launched a spacecraft
to collect data about Pluto.

03:52.179 --> 03:54.112
It's finally close enough, so

03:54.114 --> 03:56.214
this morning
it turned itself on.

03:56.216 --> 03:57.449
We hope.

03:57.451 --> 03:59.384
The signal has to travel
over three billion miles.

03:59.386 --> 04:01.786
So it's gonna be hours before
we know if it even survived.

04:01.788 --> 04:04.322
Now we get to see him flip out
because he's worried

04:04.324 --> 04:05.857
it was demolished by space ice.

04:05.859 --> 04:08.059
Space ice is no joke.

04:08.928 --> 04:11.362
I can't even watch
<i>Frozen</i> anymore.

04:14.233 --> 04:17.402
Ooh, the philharmonic
is playing Beethoven downtown.

04:17.404 --> 04:18.970
Yeah, well, before
you say yes,

04:18.971 --> 04:22.240
it's not the movie
about the big dog.

04:25.311 --> 04:27.578
How come we can't think
of something we both want to do?

04:27.580 --> 04:29.847
Because you always
pick what we do

04:29.849 --> 04:31.315
and I just
go along with it.

04:31.317 --> 04:32.683
Ah, interesting--

04:32.685 --> 04:34.652
we're being accused of
making you do things

04:34.654 --> 04:36.053
you don't like,
and here you are,

04:36.055 --> 04:37.722
doing the same
thing to poor Amy.

04:37.724 --> 04:40.424
You should point out
the hypocrisy of that.

04:44.229 --> 04:45.663
That's what I was doing.

04:46.865 --> 04:49.367
Oh, that wasn't clear.

04:49.369 --> 04:51.168
Try it again, but this time
drive it home

04:51.170 --> 04:54.772
with, “How do you like
them apples, Missy?”

04:54.774 --> 04:56.474
All right,
keep thinking.

04:56.476 --> 04:58.776
You're making it
too complicated.

04:58.778 --> 04:59.910
Why not stick
to the basics?

04:59.912 --> 05:01.412
Go shopping for clothes

05:01.414 --> 05:02.780
while Leonard and I sit in those

05:02.782 --> 05:05.349
uncomfortable chairs
and hold your purses, hmm?

05:05.351 --> 05:06.617
I know I'd hate that.

05:06.619 --> 05:07.785
Leonard?

05:07.787 --> 05:10.120
Well, yeah.

05:10.122 --> 05:13.224
Well, then, it's settled?

05:13.226 --> 05:15.259
What do you say?
Sounds kind of perfect.

05:15.261 --> 05:16.861
It does-- somehow he managed

05:16.863 --> 05:19.430
to take all the fun out of it.

05:19.432 --> 05:21.599
Well, once again,
it's what I do.

05:24.102 --> 05:26.804
Oh, another two hours to go.

05:26.806 --> 05:28.505
The wait
is killing me.

05:28.507 --> 05:31.308
I know. I get it. When I was
in the Soyuz capsule

05:31.310 --> 05:33.944
returning from the space
station, plummeting toward Earth

05:33.946 --> 05:36.080
at 17,000 miles per hour...
Before you finish,

05:36.082 --> 05:39.016
is this a story about
patience and waiting

05:39.018 --> 05:42.152
or just another reminder
that you went to space?

05:44.088 --> 05:46.323
A story can
do two things.

05:46.325 --> 05:48.258
Ugh, I feel like I'm gonna
have a heart attack.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.260
You work in
pharmaceuticals--

05:50.262 --> 05:52.829
don't you have
anything you can give him?

05:52.831 --> 05:55.832
All I have is our new
urine flow drug.

05:57.201 --> 06:00.037
Won't help with his anxiety,
but it's so strong, when he pees

06:00.039 --> 06:02.539
he'll fly around the room
like he's got a jet pack.

06:04.208 --> 06:06.943
I can't stop thinking about it.

06:06.945 --> 06:09.405
You know, worrying won't
have any effect on what happens.

06:09.406 --> 06:10.409
I know.

06:10.433 --> 06:12.505
Maybe you need to do
something more productive.

06:13.152 --> 06:15.318
Okay.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.320
Ah.

06:17.322 --> 06:20.223
If I make this shot

06:20.225 --> 06:21.558
in the trash can,

06:21.560 --> 06:23.793
the probe will have arrived

06:23.795 --> 06:26.930
in perfect working order.

06:26.932 --> 06:28.832
So, in addition to being crazy,
you're resting the fate

06:28.834 --> 06:32.168
of the mission
on your athletic prowess.

06:32.170 --> 06:33.670
Yes.

06:33.672 --> 06:36.439
The man who crashed
his stationary bike.

06:37.641 --> 06:39.743
I didn't crash it, okay?

06:39.745 --> 06:41.277
My playlist was too up-tempo,

06:41.279 --> 06:43.713
I got light-headed
and I fell off.

06:45.116 --> 06:46.916
Okay.

06:47.751 --> 06:49.319
It all...

06:49.321 --> 06:51.488
comes down...

06:51.490 --> 06:53.523
to this.

06:55.793 --> 06:58.761
You happy? Now you can relax.

06:58.763 --> 07:00.296
What kind of scientist are you?
Everyone knows

07:00.298 --> 07:02.065
you got to make
two out of three.

07:09.707 --> 07:12.041
This isn't so bad.

07:12.043 --> 07:14.076
That's easy for you to say.

07:14.078 --> 07:17.079
Your chair's not
facing the lingerie section.

07:18.048 --> 07:21.184
Boy, that's a lot of panties.

07:21.186 --> 07:24.186
You guys comfy?
This might take a while.

07:24.188 --> 07:25.688
You know, I don't
understand why women

07:25.690 --> 07:27.456
insist on making
a big production

07:27.458 --> 07:28.824
out of buying clothes.

07:28.826 --> 07:30.560
No, you're right,
we should do what you do.

07:30.562 --> 07:34.096
Have our mom send us pants
from the Walmart in Houston.

07:35.232 --> 07:36.599
They have a man there

07:36.601 --> 07:38.968
who understands
my personal style.

07:40.037 --> 07:41.237
Bye.

07:41.239 --> 07:43.472
Uh, I've got some bad news.

07:43.474 --> 07:45.408
There's no cell service in here.

07:45.410 --> 07:47.376
Oh.

07:47.378 --> 07:49.011
Well, that's all right.

07:49.013 --> 07:50.880
There were plenty of ways
to pass the time

07:50.882 --> 07:52.748
before smart phones
were invented.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.316
That's true.

07:54.318 --> 07:56.519
I'll look them up.

07:59.022 --> 08:01.624
Son of a biscuit.

08:01.626 --> 08:03.626
Sheldon, it's fine.

08:03.628 --> 08:04.827
No, it's not fine.

08:04.829 --> 08:06.328
What kind of store
in the 21st century

08:06.330 --> 08:07.730
doesn't at least have Wi-Fi?

08:07.732 --> 08:09.264
I'm going to call
their corporate office...

08:09.266 --> 08:11.166
Son of a biscuit!

08:19.942 --> 08:23.044
Let's see, my armies

08:23.046 --> 08:25.546
are going
to attack the Shire

08:25.548 --> 08:26.914
from Buckland.

08:26.916 --> 08:29.083
And I roll...

08:33.856 --> 08:35.556
a five and a three.

08:35.558 --> 08:36.991
Okay.

08:36.993 --> 08:41.495
And to defend, I roll...

08:41.496 --> 08:43.698
two sixes. I win.

08:43.700 --> 08:46.901
Boy, double-sixes again.

08:46.903 --> 08:48.369
You know...
if I hadn't seen it

08:48.371 --> 08:50.338
with my own eyes,
I wouldn't believe it.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.608
I wonder how long
we're gonna be stuck here.

08:54.610 --> 08:56.310
I don't know, but the girls
do a lot for us.

08:56.312 --> 08:57.711
It's the least we can do.

08:57.713 --> 08:59.713
Oh, that's true.
I suppose it's only fair

08:59.715 --> 09:01.248
we make compromises.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.684
Look at you,
being all mature.

09:03.686 --> 09:07.721
I don't know why
you're so surprised.

09:07.723 --> 09:09.523
If there's one thing I know
about after living with you

09:09.525 --> 09:12.626
for so many years,
it's how to compromise.

09:13.561 --> 09:15.429
I-I'm sorry?

09:15.431 --> 09:17.698
You make compromises for me?

09:19.034 --> 09:20.968
All the time.

09:22.037 --> 09:23.804
On Earth?

09:26.307 --> 09:28.308
In our lives?

09:29.310 --> 09:31.845
That-That we're living?

09:31.847 --> 09:34.381
Oh, yes. I...

09:34.383 --> 09:37.451
Just yesterday, you had
a-a big piece of lettuce

09:37.453 --> 09:39.119
stuck in your teeth at lunch.

09:39.121 --> 09:42.689
Did I say anything? No.

09:43.858 --> 09:45.626
I compromised

09:45.628 --> 09:47.861
and kept my mouth shut.

09:47.863 --> 09:51.465
Like you should've, because
everyone was laughing at you.

09:51.467 --> 09:54.468
That is not
a compromise.

09:54.470 --> 09:56.570
A compromise is me
driving you everywhere

09:56.572 --> 09:58.171
because you refuse to learn how.

09:58.173 --> 10:00.574
Oh, I learned how.
Amy taught me.

10:00.576 --> 10:02.609
What? Then-Then why
don't you do it?

10:02.611 --> 10:05.745
Uh, well, it's scary.

10:05.747 --> 10:09.916
And sometimes
I get the pedals mixed up.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.687
But, more importantly,
driving me to work

10:13.689 --> 10:16.623
is one of the things
that gives your life purpose.

10:18.459 --> 10:20.093
I can't take that away from you,

10:20.095 --> 10:23.063
so... what do I do?

10:24.565 --> 10:26.866
Oh, come on, I'm practically
feeding you the answer.

10:26.868 --> 10:29.836
I compromise.

10:31.972 --> 10:34.419
Hey, uh, thanks for
keeping me company.

10:34.443 --> 10:35.409
I'm happy to.

10:35.410 --> 10:37.944
I think getting out of
the apartment will do you good.

10:37.946 --> 10:40.513
So... where we headed?

10:40.515 --> 10:43.082
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to go to temple.

10:43.084 --> 10:47.854
Buddy, trust me, you don't want
to convert to Judaism.

10:48.622 --> 10:50.223
I mean, I know I make it
look cool,

10:50.225 --> 10:55.094
but... it's not all briskets
and dreidels.

10:55.096 --> 10:57.530
I meant a Hindu temple.

10:57.532 --> 11:00.400
Oh. Okay.

11:00.402 --> 11:03.035
It's not like <i> Indiana Jones</i>
<i>and the Temple of Doom,</i> right?

11:03.037 --> 11:07.006
Some bald guy with horns
isn't gonna rip my heart out.

11:07.008 --> 11:09.375
Dude, that movie's
an imperialist fantasy

11:09.377 --> 11:12.812
that makes the followers of a
beautiful and peaceful religion

11:12.814 --> 11:15.248
look like a bunch
of bloodthirsty barbarians.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.215
You love that movie.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.985
Yeah, it's pretty great.

11:21.588 --> 11:24.457
I'm surprised to see you
suddenly get religious.

11:24.459 --> 11:25.725
Why?

11:25.727 --> 11:28.494
Well, because I've known you
for ten years

11:28.496 --> 11:30.196
and you've never gone to temple,

11:30.198 --> 11:31.997
you never talked
about believing in God,

11:31.999 --> 11:36.268
and last Diwali I watched you
eat two pounds of sacred cow

11:36.270 --> 11:39.438
at a Brazilian steak house.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.274
Religion is
a very personal thing.

11:42.276 --> 11:44.877
I do go to temple--
I just... I don't talk about it.

11:44.879 --> 11:46.412
Yeah, but you're
a scientist.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.479
So?

11:47.481 --> 11:48.881
So, as a scientist,
you believe the way

11:48.883 --> 11:51.016
to understand the universe
is through facts and evidence,

11:51.018 --> 11:52.084
and now
you're counting

11:52.086 --> 11:53.786
on some blue chick

11:53.788 --> 11:55.988
with a hundred arms to help you?

11:55.990 --> 11:58.324
That is so offensive.
Does everything you know

11:58.326 --> 11:59.925
about Hinduism come
from <i> Indiana Jones?</i>

11:59.927 --> 12:03.362
No. There's also Apu
from <i> The Simpsons.</i>

12:04.230 --> 12:07.866
Well, lots of scientists
believe in God.

12:07.868 --> 12:10.702
Okay? Newton,
uh, Faraday,

12:10.704 --> 12:12.371
uh, Pascal-- all were believers.

12:12.373 --> 12:15.140
Even Einstein was famous
for attacking quantum theory

12:15.142 --> 12:17.509
on the grounds
that “God does not play dice

12:17.511 --> 12:18.844
with the universe.”
Well, of course

12:18.846 --> 12:22.648
he believed in God--
he slept with Marilyn Monroe.

12:22.650 --> 12:24.449
Actually
there's no proof of that.

12:24.451 --> 12:27.185
You believe in your religion,
I'll believe in mine.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.490
How's it going
in there?

12:31.492 --> 12:32.492
Eh.

12:32.493 --> 12:35.360
Not really a great outfit
for work,

12:35.362 --> 12:39.898
unless something opens up in
the hookers and whores division.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.868
Hey, can I ask you something?
Sure.

12:42.870 --> 12:45.637
Do I really force you
to do things you don't want to?

12:45.639 --> 12:47.572
Yeah, but it's okay.

12:47.574 --> 12:48.807
How is it okay?

12:48.809 --> 12:51.209
I promised myself,
if I ever got friends,

12:51.211 --> 12:53.445
I'd do whatever they said.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.716
Really, I'm lucky you found me
before a cult did.

12:57.718 --> 13:00.552
Well, you know,
that was a long time ago.

13:00.554 --> 13:03.321
You're a different woman now.
You're smart,

13:03.323 --> 13:06.024
you've got great friends,
you've got a boyfriend,

13:06.026 --> 13:09.994
you're pretty, you have
zero fashion sense, but...

13:09.996 --> 13:12.464
Anyway, tonight we're gonna do
whatever you want.

13:12.466 --> 13:13.498
Really?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.767
Absolutely.
You name it, we're doing it.

13:16.569 --> 13:19.971
Basket weaving
at the craft museum.

13:19.973 --> 13:23.708
Well, you named it.

13:27.446 --> 13:29.280
Oh, here's another one.

13:29.282 --> 13:33.251
I wish that the apple pancake
mix was on the top shelf

13:33.253 --> 13:34.952
because it starts with an “A,”

13:34.954 --> 13:36.754
but I don't put it there

13:36.756 --> 13:38.956
because I don't want you
breaking one of your little legs

13:38.958 --> 13:41.392
when you're supposed
to be making my breakfast.

13:42.695 --> 13:46.764
Is it my turn to talk
about the compromises I make?

13:46.766 --> 13:51.169
I wasn't done, but go ahead.

13:51.171 --> 13:54.839
He said, compromising.

13:54.841 --> 13:56.774
Because of you, I'm not allowed

13:56.776 --> 13:58.809
to adjust the temperature
in my own home.

13:58.811 --> 14:00.278
I'm not allowed to whistle.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.580
I don't wear shoes
that might squeak.

14:02.582 --> 14:05.249
Well, you're a physicist,
not a circus clown.

14:05.251 --> 14:09.654
Sheldon, do you realize I don't
live with the woman I love

14:09.656 --> 14:11.288
because of you?

14:12.224 --> 14:13.624
No other reason. Just you.

14:13.626 --> 14:16.093
Is that true?
Yes, it's true. The last time

14:16.095 --> 14:17.495
I brought it up,
you had an emotional breakdown

14:17.497 --> 14:20.498
and got on a train and ran away.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.266
Well, given my history
on the subject,

14:22.268 --> 14:25.136
it seems a little reckless
to bring it up now.

14:25.138 --> 14:29.440
You have no idea
how much you inconvenience

14:29.442 --> 14:31.075
the lives of everyone
around you.

14:31.077 --> 14:33.010
It's exhausting!

14:33.012 --> 14:34.478
You know what?

14:34.480 --> 14:36.480
You think you're so tolerant,

14:36.482 --> 14:38.449
but the truth is...

14:38.451 --> 14:40.517
you're mean to me a lot.

14:40.519 --> 14:41.919
Yeah,
you think

14:41.921 --> 14:43.587
that I don't notice
all those sarcastic comments

14:43.589 --> 14:45.989
and those eye rolls,
but I do. Hmm?

14:45.991 --> 14:48.625
I have
excellent peripheral vision.

14:49.928 --> 14:53.864
On a good day,
I can see my ears.

14:54.866 --> 14:57.568
Sheldon, I-I'm sorry
if I hurt your feelings.

14:57.570 --> 15:00.370
I've been holding a lot
of this in for a while.

15:00.372 --> 15:02.039
Well, I'm sorry, too.
And if you want

15:02.041 --> 15:04.708
to live with Penny,
then I think you should.

15:04.710 --> 15:06.143
Do you mean that?

15:06.145 --> 15:08.512
Yes. Yeah, just put
on your squeaky shoes and...

15:08.514 --> 15:11.181
your way out of my life.

15:13.818 --> 15:15.819
Come on, don't get upset.

15:15.821 --> 15:17.954
I'm not upset.

15:17.956 --> 15:23.226
I'm just imagining a world
without my best friend in it.

15:24.328 --> 15:25.562
Sheldon.

15:25.564 --> 15:26.530
It's okay.

15:26.532 --> 15:29.366
I-I'm not leaving your world.

15:29.368 --> 15:32.202
I'm just talking
about living across the hall.

15:32.204 --> 15:33.470
I understand.

15:33.472 --> 15:36.072
Either way,
I want you to know that...

15:36.074 --> 15:38.208
I'm aware of how difficult
I can be.

15:38.210 --> 15:39.843
So I just want
to say...

15:39.845 --> 15:44.147
thank you
for putting up with me.

15:44.149 --> 15:46.583
Buddy...

15:50.154 --> 15:51.488
How are you guys
getting alo...?

15:51.490 --> 15:53.890
What? Why are
there tears?

15:53.892 --> 15:55.525
Everything's fine.

15:55.527 --> 15:58.194
We just started talking
about living arrangements.

15:58.196 --> 16:01.931
Are you crazy? You know
he's a flight risk.

16:01.933 --> 16:05.802
That's exactly
what I told him.

16:05.804 --> 16:07.904
Sheldon, we know this
is a sensitive subject,

16:07.906 --> 16:10.406
and Leonard's not gonna
move out until you're ready.

16:12.176 --> 16:15.378
Well, what if you did it
gradually?

16:16.246 --> 16:18.214
All right. Well...

16:18.216 --> 16:21.584
how about we start
with two nights a week

16:21.586 --> 16:23.052
I live with Penny?

16:23.054 --> 16:27.190
How about one night and...

16:27.192 --> 16:29.392
I let you whistle?

16:32.996 --> 16:34.797
Okay.

16:34.799 --> 16:36.766
When I'm not home.

16:37.601 --> 16:39.869
You got it.

16:40.737 --> 16:42.605
There we go,

16:42.607 --> 16:45.308
compromising again.

16:45.310 --> 16:48.477
We really are the best.

16:55.485 --> 16:57.453
Here we go,

16:57.455 --> 16:59.088
my first
Hindu temple.

16:59.090 --> 17:01.624
You see behind the
fountain, that tower

17:01.626 --> 17:03.425
<i>that looks like a pyramid?</i>

17:03.427 --> 17:05.428
It's called a Sikhara.
It symbolizes

17:05.430 --> 17:08.396
the-the connection between
the human and the divine.

17:08.398 --> 17:09.365
Huh.

17:09.367 --> 17:11.834
I always thought
it was mini golf.

17:12.669 --> 17:14.536
All right. Shall we?

17:14.538 --> 17:18.307
Yeah. Just, uh, is there
anything I should know

17:18.309 --> 17:19.608
before I go in?

17:19.609 --> 17:20.809
Like what?

17:20.810 --> 17:23.579
Like am I dressed okay?

17:23.580 --> 17:25.646
Really? So every other place
you've been,

17:25.648 --> 17:27.883
you thought this was fine?

17:27.885 --> 17:30.786
I know you're under a lot
of pressure,

17:30.788 --> 17:32.087
so I'm gonna let that pass.

17:32.089 --> 17:33.956
Sorry. You're right.

17:33.958 --> 17:35.791
I'm so stressed.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.559
But you know what,

17:37.561 --> 17:39.761
whenever I walk
into that temple

17:39.763 --> 17:42.130
I realize that whatever happens,
it's okay.

17:42.132 --> 17:44.266
We're all part of
an immense pattern,

17:44.268 --> 17:47.169
and though we can't understand
it, we can be happy to know

17:47.171 --> 17:49.671
that it's-it's working its will
through us.

17:49.673 --> 17:52.741
That's nice.

17:52.743 --> 17:54.977
Whether you call it God
or the universe or the self,

17:54.979 --> 17:58.347
we're all interconnected,
and that's just a beautiful...

17:58.349 --> 18:02.284
Son of a bitch!
That guy just dinged my car!

18:03.086 --> 18:05.387
S-Seriously?

18:05.389 --> 18:07.255
Y-You were
just gonna drive away?

18:07.257 --> 18:08.490
Like my life

18:08.492 --> 18:09.891
isn't hard enough right now.

18:09.893 --> 18:12.561
A space probe
might be destroyed,

18:12.563 --> 18:14.563
my parents are going
through an awful divorce,

18:14.565 --> 18:18.099
the guy who cuts my dog's hair
just gave her bangs!

18:18.101 --> 18:20.168
Raj.

18:20.170 --> 18:23.471
You saw her. She looks like
Jim Carrey from <i> Dumb and Dumber!</i>

18:23.473 --> 18:26.174
Raj, you just
got a text.

18:26.176 --> 18:28.610
The probe turned
on. It's fine.

18:29.378 --> 18:32.113
Oh, good.

18:32.948 --> 18:35.750
<i>Namaste,</i> Grandpa.

18:43.526 --> 18:45.760
I thought
this was gonna be boring,

18:45.762 --> 18:47.362
but it's actually kind of fun.

18:47.364 --> 18:51.399
Don't tell Amy that. We'll
be here every Sunday.

18:51.401 --> 18:54.068
Sheldon, that really is
an excellent basket.

18:54.070 --> 18:55.837
It's not a basket.

18:55.839 --> 18:59.440
It's a soldier's helmet
from 16th century China.

19:02.778 --> 19:04.345
Very nice.

19:04.347 --> 19:07.548
Yeah, it
looks great.

19:08.884 --> 19:12.053
I saw that.

Well, roomie,
it's only one night a week,

19:25.594 --> 19:26.694
but it's a start.

19:26.696 --> 19:28.729
I know. I'm really
proud of Sheldon.

19:28.731 --> 19:30.597
Yeah, I'm proud of him, too.

19:30.599 --> 19:32.299
Can you keep it
down? Some of us

19:32.301 --> 19:33.599
are trying
to sleep out here.
