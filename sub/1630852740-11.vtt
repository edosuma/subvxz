WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:02.350
Every once in a while,

00:03.264 --> 00:04.743
you see someone
has had so much botox,

00:05.092 --> 00:06.397
- their forehead looks shiny.
- Yeah.

00:10.314 --> 00:11.750
The man, the myth.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.752
- My name was Rodrigo Alvarez.
- Rodrigo!

00:14.101 --> 00:15.537
I'’m a pricey bitch,

00:15.580 --> 00:17.278
and I don't care if
you don't like, bitch.

00:17.321 --> 00:20.324
I think I'’m kind
of a cheap bitch.

00:20.368 --> 00:23.153
I don't want a boob job.
I want a boob career.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.329
Oh, how did that happen?

00:25.373 --> 00:27.375
Looks like I have a ball
sack on my foot.

00:27.418 --> 00:29.507
I ended up losing my
entire upper lip.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.509
My identity
was taken from me.

00:31.553 --> 00:32.684
This is a doctor?

00:32.728 --> 00:34.817
Holy sh--

00:34.860 --> 00:37.646
I'm tired of people looking
at my knee, it's disfigured,

00:37.689 --> 00:40.388
I put a maxi pad there to
relieve pressure from my scars.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.216
She was ice cold.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.218
I told her I'm going
to take her to the hospital.

00:44.261 --> 00:46.829
If it wasn'’t for
him, I wouldn'’t be here.

00:47.177 --> 00:50.833
- It'’s emotional.
- One sec, I'’ll be right back.

00:52.313 --> 00:54.576
I haven'’t
seen that before, ever.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.580
You need
extraordinary measures

00:58.623 --> 01:00.712
for an extraordinarily
complex problem.

01:00.756 --> 01:03.193
Playing with silicone.
It'’s like playing with fire.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.629
Oh, my goodness.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.240
We are
pushing the envelope today,

01:06.283 --> 01:07.502
but there'’s no other choice.

01:07.719 --> 01:09.373
We'’re racing against the clock,

01:09.417 --> 01:11.158
You only have about two hours

01:11.201 --> 01:13.290
or you can
actually kill the leg.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.205
It'’s a bloody mess in here.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.686
It'’s almost like a small bomb
went off inside the nose.

01:17.729 --> 01:20.689
This is a massive
reconstruction. Wow.

01:20.732 --> 01:22.299
Can someone
pat me on the back?

01:22.343 --> 01:24.127
Bye bye janky boobs.

01:26.738 --> 01:29.219
I can actually
see myself again.

01:29.263 --> 01:30.394
Rock star!

01:30.438 --> 01:33.223
Yeah, baby.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.921
♪ I want to be sexy

01:35.965 --> 01:38.620
♪ I want to be hot

01:38.663 --> 01:42.406
♪ Fix me, make me beautiful

01:42.450 --> 01:45.453
♪ I want to be perfect

01:49.283 --> 01:54.505
♪ The flame is burning

01:54.549 --> 01:55.898
My name is Anakaliyah,

01:56.246 --> 01:58.814
I've been 25 for
the past 4,000 years.

01:59.336 --> 02:01.643
I consider myself
a sexy vamptress.

02:04.820 --> 02:09.433
So I came into being a vamptress
because I'’ve always liked

02:09.477 --> 02:13.350
the glamor aesthetic, but I also
liked the goth aesthetic.

02:13.655 --> 02:18.747
Hence, now I'’m a sexy vamptress,
I love the look of vampires,

02:18.790 --> 02:20.923
they're very
sensual, sexy, dark,

02:21.271 --> 02:24.970
mysterious creatures and their
fangs, they're sexy.

02:25.014 --> 02:27.756
So I got some fangs.

02:27.799 --> 02:30.498
Vampires don'’t age,

02:30.541 --> 02:34.632
so I got to look good for
the years to come.

02:34.676 --> 02:37.940
I've had four breast surgeries,
upper eyelid surgery,

02:38.288 --> 02:41.291
septoplasty,
buccal fat removal, lipo,

02:41.335 --> 02:43.815
rib removal
and oblique suturing.

02:43.859 --> 02:47.471
And I have a designer vagina.

02:47.515 --> 02:53.564
So a designer vagina is when
you fix your pussy lips.

02:53.608 --> 02:56.480
Snip, snip, snip.
Great camel toe.

02:56.524 --> 03:00.267
Another asset to accentuate.

03:00.310 --> 03:03.487
It's been six months since
my last breast surgery.

03:03.531 --> 03:06.316
And right now the right areola
is going all the way

03:06.360 --> 03:07.970
to the right
instead of straight on.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.799
My ultimate goal is to look
perfect when I'm naked.

03:10.842 --> 03:14.498
I'’m a vamptress. I have two
million years ahead of me,

03:14.542 --> 03:16.370
so there's no way
that I'm going to look

03:16.413 --> 03:17.719
two million years old.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.945
Today, we're going
to be drawing

03:26.989 --> 03:28.382
on your upper lip.

03:28.425 --> 03:29.992
Yes.
My name is Patia,

03:30.340 --> 03:32.951
and after losing my upper
lip to cancer,

03:33.300 --> 03:36.433
my face looks like
a Halloween mask.

03:37.391 --> 03:38.827
About 15 months ago,

03:38.870 --> 03:41.525
I went in to have basal
carcinoma removed

03:41.569 --> 03:43.005
from my upper lip.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.877
As soon as
I found out that basal carcinoma

03:45.921 --> 03:48.315
is caused by laying
out in the sun,

03:48.358 --> 03:50.055
I thought how, as a teenager,

03:50.099 --> 03:54.669
I would put Crisco on my body
and lay out on tinfoil.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.497
Like that'’s not okay.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.326
They found more
than it was expected

03:59.369 --> 04:01.893
and I ended up losing
my entire upper lip.

04:01.937 --> 04:05.419
She was definitely in shock
for the first few months.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.508
It was really hard. She couldn't
even look at herself

04:07.551 --> 04:08.900
in the mirror.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.903
Before,
I was always smiling, happy.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.992
I've never had a problem with
the way I've looked.

04:14.036 --> 04:18.910
This procedure that I thought
was supposed to be so simple

04:18.954 --> 04:22.610
and easy ended up completely
taking my face from me.

04:22.653 --> 04:25.482
It's a daily struggle
as far as eating.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.919
I have to cut everything
up really tiny.

04:27.963 --> 04:32.272
I cannot open my mouth
fully or even smile.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.624
I mean, I can't really
even kiss my husband,

04:36.667 --> 04:39.366
I can do the kissing motion,
but, I mean,

04:39.409 --> 04:40.932
I have no pucker.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.847
Where'’s my sexy lip look?

04:42.891 --> 04:44.588
- It looks fantastic.
- Oh good.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.074
Hey.

04:53.815 --> 04:54.946
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.383
Are you on your knees?

04:56.426 --> 04:57.775
- Yeah.
- Get up.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.473
Are they yelling at
you to get up?

04:59.516 --> 05:02.127
Yeah, I'm 58 years
old on a surfboard.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.868
By the way, you'’re not
surfing your wave.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.696
They'’re making a wave for you.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.569
I could let go of that rope and
surf that wave.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.397
You can do that?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.094
Yeah, I'’d stand up.
It'’s called wakeboarding.

05:12.529 --> 05:15.445
I'’m trying
to get closer, and oh.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.142
Seriously that'’s lame.

05:17.186 --> 05:19.580
- That'’s called wake--
- Laming.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.756
Surfboarding on the knees.

05:21.799 --> 05:24.802
That's called lame wake surfing.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.151
I think I did a good job.

05:26.195 --> 05:28.066
Wakeboarding? Yeah.

05:28.110 --> 05:30.852
Wake me up when you've got
something cool to show me.

05:30.895 --> 05:33.724
- Meet Patia.
- Patia has a bad--

05:33.768 --> 05:36.640
A couple of years ago,
had a little spot

05:36.684 --> 05:38.468
on her right upper lip area.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.470
Bottom line
is she ended up

05:40.514 --> 05:43.430
with this
complete horrible deformity.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.780
How fixable is this,
by the way?

05:45.823 --> 05:47.608
Let'’s see. Let's get her in.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.523
Can you please send in Patia?

05:51.220 --> 05:53.831
Patia. How are you doing?
Dr. Dubrow.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.137
How are you?

05:55.485 --> 05:56.921
I feel like
I'm at a point

05:56.965 --> 05:59.097
that I have to have
my lip reconstructed.

05:59.141 --> 06:05.016
I can'’t be happy
in my life if I don'’t

06:05.060 --> 06:07.018
try to make it better.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.977
When we look at your photos,

06:09.020 --> 06:13.111
we're puzzled by the treatment
that you had in your outcome

06:13.460 --> 06:15.853
for what we think
is usually a small thing.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.551
How long has
it been since the surgery?

06:17.594 --> 06:18.900
A year and a half.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.858
Tell us what happened.

06:20.902 --> 06:24.558
Well, I actually went to take
my son to the dermatologist

06:24.601 --> 06:26.211
because he was struggling
with some acne.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.865
And I asked her, I said,

06:27.909 --> 06:29.780
can you check this out
underneath my nose?

06:29.824 --> 06:32.174
I had a couple little bumps
that were clear, that

06:32.522 --> 06:34.872
I thought were probably
some clogged pores,

06:34.916 --> 06:36.918
but it was basal carcinoma

06:36.961 --> 06:39.616
and it would be one to two
stitches. So I really--

06:39.660 --> 06:41.531
They were
going to punch it out probably.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.533
Exactly. Like it was just going
to be super simple.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.753
They scheduled it for
two weeks later.

06:45.796 --> 06:49.060
I went in to
the dermatologist office.

06:49.104 --> 06:50.671
I didn't even go with her.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.716
There wasn'’t
anything alarming.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.937
He went in and cut the first
margin and came back and said,

06:55.980 --> 06:57.895
"This is more than we thought
it was."

06:57.939 --> 06:59.201
- It was.
- Right then.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.725
- Right then.
- Patia underwent

07:01.769 --> 07:04.075
a cancer removing procedure
called Mohs surgery.

07:04.119 --> 07:07.209
And you only want to take out
just the cancer cells.

07:07.557 --> 07:10.255
You take out small
slices at a time,

07:10.299 --> 07:12.562
look at it under a microscope,

07:12.606 --> 07:16.218
and then continue on 'til
you'’ve cleared that zone.

07:16.261 --> 07:19.787
He said it was kind of
like a iceberg,

07:19.830 --> 07:22.137
where he said it was, looked
like a little bit on top

07:22.180 --> 07:24.574
and it was more spread
out underneath.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.969
He proceeded to do it six times.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.754
I think she called me at that
point just in tears,

07:30.798 --> 07:33.191
just like, "I don't know what
happened." And she lost it.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.933
He came back, said,

07:35.977 --> 07:39.763
"Okay, we, looks like we'’ve got
it all," and literally told me,

07:39.807 --> 07:41.939
"Don't worry, we're not going
to cut you loose.

07:41.983 --> 07:45.595
"We're going to find a plastic
surgeon to repair the damage."

07:45.639 --> 07:47.815
Then I'’m like,
"A plastic surgeon?"

07:47.858 --> 07:49.643
Like, what in the world
is going on here?

07:49.686 --> 07:51.601
Did they give you the mirror?

07:51.645 --> 07:54.299
I couldn't look at myself at
that point. I was terrified.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.911
I was afraid I wouldn't be able
to come back from it if

07:56.954 --> 07:58.608
I were to see myself like that.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.828
So they put a dressing on
it. And sent me home.

08:00.871 --> 08:03.091
The question is how much
tissue was removed.

08:03.134 --> 08:05.180
From the nose all the way
to the lip was gone

08:05.223 --> 08:07.095
and then it was peeled out.

08:07.138 --> 08:10.228
Splayed open, so the doctor
kinda went like that.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.969
- Exactly.
- Then that was on a Friday.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.884
That following Monday
is when I got to have

08:13.928 --> 08:15.973
- the surgery.
- The reconstruction.

08:16.017 --> 08:19.977
So we took a skin graft
from my collarbone

08:20.021 --> 08:24.329
and then he took part of my
bottom lip and took it up

08:24.373 --> 08:27.637
on my top lip and made
my mouth smaller.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.247
One surgery only?

08:29.291 --> 08:31.249
One surgery only. But I don'’t
feel like this is

08:31.598 --> 08:33.338
the best somebody can do.

08:33.382 --> 08:36.211
What are your goals? What would
you like to see happen?

08:36.254 --> 08:41.129
I would like to have more of
an upper lip definition.

08:41.172 --> 08:45.176
I would like to have lips and
a smile, open my mouth more.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.178
- A wider mouth.
- That's the functional part.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.353
Yeah, exactly.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.833
What's more important for you?

08:49.877 --> 08:51.356
More important that I look good.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.837
My job is director of
first impressions.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.274
I work at a law firm

08:56.318 --> 08:58.276
and I'm the first person
they see when they walk in.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.671
And so that's been
extremely hard.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.804
I mean, what's your first
impression when you see

09:03.847 --> 09:05.283
somebody that looks like me?

09:05.632 --> 09:07.242
You want to find out like
what happened to her?

09:07.285 --> 09:10.332
It's like your identity is taken
from me within hours.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.728
And it just seemed like
it was no big deal.

09:14.771 --> 09:17.339
You know, it'’s just been
a horrible experience.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.692
After three surgeries on
my heel, it looks gruesome.

09:22.736 --> 09:25.565
Let'’s just hope that Dr. Dubrow
cuts this ball sack off.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.743
I consider
my body a work of art.

09:29.786 --> 09:32.093
The left titty
is the wrong titty.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.921
No, the left titty
is the right titty.

09:38.316 --> 09:41.058
Let me take a quick little look,
close your teeth.

09:42.364 --> 09:45.280
You got some that upper
lip right there.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.369
That's pretty amazing, actually.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.762
Hold that.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.852
Okay, so he took
a flap like this,

09:51.895 --> 09:55.377
lifted this up, took this and
moved it over to here.

09:55.420 --> 09:58.380
As he lifted that flap up and
pulled it kind of pulled

09:58.423 --> 10:01.862
the lip over and then your
mouth opening is shorter.

10:01.905 --> 10:05.343
So we call the lateral
commissur has been shortened.

10:05.387 --> 10:07.171
The procedure to do
that is called

10:07.215 --> 10:10.218
the commissuroplasty.
A commissurplasty

10:10.261 --> 10:14.657
is changing the corner
of the mouth. In Patia'’s case

10:14.701 --> 10:18.443
what we need to do is take
the short commissur,

10:18.487 --> 10:21.621
cut it and just extend it
to equal the length

10:21.664 --> 10:25.581
of the other side. We have
to move tissue, move mucosa,

10:25.625 --> 10:28.584
and move muscle to
make that happen.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.281
If you take
a look right here,

10:30.325 --> 10:32.501
so we can maybe lift
all this up,

10:32.544 --> 10:35.243
try to debulk some of
this even, down here,

10:35.286 --> 10:36.810
that will hopefully, one,

10:36.853 --> 10:40.465
get rid of some
of the fulness. Two, give us

10:40.509 --> 10:42.424
a little bit of lift like that.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.819
So our goal would be
to make the upper lip look

10:46.167 --> 10:48.430
- more natural and normal.
- Okay.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.606
That's not without risks.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.608
- I know.
- Because I can kill the flap

10:52.652 --> 10:54.523
and I can
kill all that tissue.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.786
And so after hearing this whole
thing we talked about.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.615
What do you think?

11:00.485 --> 11:06.448
I feel a sense of relief that
you all can help me,

11:06.491 --> 11:08.276
that you guys were probably
the only ones

11:08.319 --> 11:11.235
- I could trust to help me.
- Tate?

11:11.279 --> 11:13.455
As long as she feels
comfortable with it,

11:13.498 --> 11:15.413
then I'’m definitely comfortable
with it.

11:15.457 --> 11:19.504
I know I'm never going to look
the way I did before this,

11:19.679 --> 11:24.858
but I hope that the surgery will
help me get my life back,

11:24.901 --> 11:28.513
my identity back and make me
feel like myself again.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.777
Have you ever seen patients

11:30.820 --> 11:33.562
who have gotten
their lips tattooed?

11:33.605 --> 11:35.303
I have, yes.

11:35.346 --> 11:37.914
They can make
your lips look so symmetrical

11:38.262 --> 11:40.525
and so normal. You're a great
candidate for that.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.702
- I'm here for it.
- I look forward to seeing you.

11:42.745 --> 11:45.748
Thank you so very much.
Thank you, Dr. Dubrow.

11:45.792 --> 11:46.880
Thank you so much.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.279
Ooh, I like these.
Are they going to cover my foot?

11:55.323 --> 11:57.804
They do have a little bit of
strap, so.

11:57.847 --> 11:59.675
Okay, we can try it on.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.678
Sorry. Thank you, dad.
My name is Destiny.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.376
I'm 19 years old and it looks
like I have a ball sack

12:05.420 --> 12:08.597
on my foot. I was born with
a benign tumor,

12:08.640 --> 12:10.904
after finding
out my parents took

12:11.252 --> 12:13.384
the precautions necessary
to have that removed.

12:13.428 --> 12:16.561
And now I have a big mass on

12:16.605 --> 12:19.826
the bottom of my right heel that
continues to grow over time.

12:19.869 --> 12:24.656
It'’s hairy, it's big,
it'’s long. It looks gruesome.

12:24.700 --> 12:28.530
You see the pores, I step on
the outside of my foot.

12:28.573 --> 12:31.925
I don'’t like this. You see it,
like how it comes out.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.796
It's always so complicated.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.406
Oh, that'’s already a no.

12:35.450 --> 12:36.930
This thing
is wretched.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.801
I'’m not going to, no, here.

12:38.845 --> 12:43.458
I can only buy wide style
gym shoes or wide style

12:43.501 --> 12:45.677
thick strappy shoes.

12:45.721 --> 12:49.029
Any time that I wear an
exposed shoe, people,

12:49.072 --> 12:50.813
they stare at my foot.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.989
It's a dream of mine to walk
barefoot on a beach.

12:53.337 --> 12:58.038
I want you to be happy, feel
good in your own skin.

12:58.081 --> 13:03.565
Dating? Oh, I haven'’t had the
best of luck for dating.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.697
I have to explain. This
is what happened when

13:05.741 --> 13:07.612
I was younger and I hope
you accept me.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.571
I don't feel like someone's
going to want me

13:09.614 --> 13:11.442
because of what I have.

13:11.486 --> 13:14.402
Hopefully after you see Dr.
Nassif and Dr. Dubrow,

13:14.445 --> 13:15.751
everything will work out,
you know,

13:15.795 --> 13:17.057
if they're willing to take it.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.580
So let'’s just
hope the doctor,

13:18.623 --> 13:20.408
the Dubrow
cuts this ball sack off.

13:23.759 --> 13:26.370
Whoa. Yes.

13:26.414 --> 13:29.678
Check this out. So we have
a patient named Destiny.

13:29.721 --> 13:32.072
Ooh-wee!

13:32.115 --> 13:34.857
- Is that amazing?
- When what the hell is that,

13:34.901 --> 13:36.554
because that's her heel.

13:36.598 --> 13:40.602
So Destiny had a lipoblastoma,
which is a very,

13:40.645 --> 13:43.692
very rare benign tumor

13:43.735 --> 13:44.998
- Aggressive?
- In childhood

13:45.041 --> 13:46.913
that grows very rapidly.

13:46.956 --> 13:49.480
Let'’s bring in Destiny and
see if we can help.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.831
Absolutely. Would you mind
sending in Destiny?

13:54.529 --> 13:56.618
Destiny. Nice to meet you,
Destiny, Dr Nassif.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.098
How are you, Terry Dubrow.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.796
A real pleasure.
Yeah, well, welcome.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.493
Thank you.

14:02.537 --> 14:05.453
I have a lot of your
old medical records,

14:05.496 --> 14:07.063
what'’s called lipoblastoma.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.978
- Yes?
- Yes.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.459
That'’s what they call it, first,
like around three months.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.809
It was just like a pimple
on her right heel.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.550
Several months later,

14:15.593 --> 14:17.508
I noticed they grew to
the size of a marble.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.032
And what did they tell
you about it?

14:19.075 --> 14:23.079
It was a benign tumor.
It was just fatty cells.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.516
And they would have
to remove it.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.518
And there was going
to be a big gap.

14:27.562 --> 14:30.478
And so pretty much the best way
that it can heal is taking

14:30.521 --> 14:32.872
off a piece of her back and
putting it on her foot,

14:32.915 --> 14:33.960
on her heel.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.439
And it worked. It worked.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.441
So when I had my first surgery

14:37.485 --> 14:40.662
and there'’s only six other
people who have a lipoblastoma

14:40.705 --> 14:43.752
and they wrote a case on mine
in the medical journal

14:43.795 --> 14:45.101
So you'’re in
the medical journal.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.103
- Yeah.
- Wow.

14:47.147 --> 14:50.498
The surgery that Destiny had
at 13 months of age was

14:50.541 --> 14:54.154
a very intricate microvascular
transfer of tissue

14:54.197 --> 14:57.461
from her
back to her foot, even an adult,

14:57.505 --> 14:59.159
that'’s a really complicated
operation.

14:59.202 --> 15:03.076
Imagine how complicated
and intricate it is in

15:03.119 --> 15:05.730
a 13 month old
where the nerves,

15:05.992 --> 15:08.516
the arteries and vessels
are a fraction

15:08.559 --> 15:10.170
the size of adult vessels,

15:10.213 --> 15:13.173
some really impressive
surgical feats right there.

15:13.216 --> 15:16.698
As she kept growing, and
she would gain weight,

15:16.741 --> 15:18.700
the flap would gain weight.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.920
So when she was four and eight,

15:20.963 --> 15:23.879
we went in to see that same
surgeon and they did--

15:23.923 --> 15:25.750
They did the debulking of it.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.970
- So liposuction.
- Just pure liposuction.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.146
No. And then they also
removed the excess skin.

15:30.190 --> 15:33.149
So it looked, again, like a very
thin banana and her heel.

15:33.497 --> 15:35.064
But when I went back when I was
14,

15:35.108 --> 15:36.805
- It grew again.
- Yes.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.894
They told me there's nothing
new they can do.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.157
And at that point, I was like,
I'm just going to leave it.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.551
But it's just so much that
I don't like about it.

15:43.594 --> 15:44.987
This is going to sound

15:45.031 --> 15:46.858
a little vulgar when
you examine it.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.730
It'’s going to look like
a ball sack.

15:48.773 --> 15:51.080
So any time somebody
makes me upset,

15:51.124 --> 15:53.039
I'’ll be like because I'm
going to make you suck

15:53.082 --> 15:55.911
my ball sack.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.653
- Gross, but hilarious.
- Yes.

15:58.696 --> 16:00.133
You get bullied
at all about this?

16:00.176 --> 16:02.135
Just the other day
we were walking somewhere

16:02.178 --> 16:05.138
and someone came up behind me
and took a snapshot of it.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.053
- And you're kidding me?
- Yes.

16:07.096 --> 16:11.231
It causes me to be extremely
insecure and self-conscious

16:11.274 --> 16:14.799
because I am in this phase in my
life where, there I grow into

16:14.843 --> 16:17.150
a friendship or into a
relationship or network

16:17.498 --> 16:20.066
and things like this stop
me because I'm like,

16:20.109 --> 16:21.937
"Okay,
if I get too close to them,

16:21.981 --> 16:23.939
"then they're going
to invite me to a beach,

16:23.983 --> 16:25.680
"they're going to invite
me to a pool party

16:25.723 --> 16:27.203
"and I'm not going to
go because of it."

16:27.551 --> 16:29.205
Some people do about things

16:29.249 --> 16:31.903
they'’re insecure about,
you joke about them.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.862
But really,
that joke is just

16:33.905 --> 16:37.518
a thinly veiled way of covering
your pain.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.955
Well, I will tell you,

16:39.999 --> 16:43.089
it's super complicated and I
don't want to take you to

16:43.132 --> 16:46.048
the operating room and
then kill the whole thing.

16:47.876 --> 16:50.052
She's making all the decisions
for herself this time.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.793
We're just hopeful that

16:51.836 --> 16:53.925
the outcome is something
that she's happy with.

16:53.969 --> 16:56.798
Anakaliyah,
she'’s like a sexy vamptress,

16:56.841 --> 16:59.105
I'’m like the corpse that she's
sucks a lot of blood out of.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.632
♪ I want to be perfect

17:10.594 --> 17:16.513
So interesting,
this looks to be skin

17:16.557 --> 17:20.082
and then all of that
back tissue,

17:20.126 --> 17:23.433
and that's why I think it gets
bigger and smaller as you gain

17:23.477 --> 17:25.783
and lose weight.
The way you debulk

17:25.827 --> 17:29.309
a free flap is you generally
make an incision along here.

17:29.352 --> 17:32.094
You don't want to go near here
because this is where

17:32.138 --> 17:34.314
the artery and vein are coming
in and going out.

17:34.357 --> 17:39.493
You lift this up and remove
a huge chunk of the bulk.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.495
The bulk is from the fat.

17:41.538 --> 17:44.237
Okay. If we are just
to debunk this,

17:44.280 --> 17:46.413
we don't want to come back.

17:46.456 --> 17:50.417
We can take cautery to
essentially burn the tissue.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.114
I can potentially prevent

17:52.158 --> 17:54.334
the flap from growing
back again.

17:54.377 --> 17:57.467
Okay, I would imagine if I'm
able to successfully remove

17:57.511 --> 17:59.339
the proper amount of

17:59.382 --> 18:01.732
the bulk that we end up removing
this amount of skin to

18:01.776 --> 18:04.474
which would make it cosmetically
way better.

18:04.518 --> 18:09.175
Okay, the risk of doing that is
that you kill the whole thing.

18:09.218 --> 18:10.698
And if you
kill the whole thing,

18:10.741 --> 18:12.482
you'’d have to have
another free flap.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.485
You don'’t want to bump
off the blood supply

18:15.529 --> 18:17.661
and it's really important
that you preserve

18:17.705 --> 18:21.665
the ability to evert and
invert your ankle

18:21.709 --> 18:24.668
and keep being able to
flex and extend.

18:24.712 --> 18:28.672
I think this needs another
set of hands and eyes.

18:28.716 --> 18:31.719
- My other best friend.
- Besides Dr. Nassif.

18:31.762 --> 18:34.156
Truly my other best friend is

18:34.200 --> 18:36.854
a gentleman named Dr. Scott
Forman

18:36.898 --> 18:38.682
who is extremely gifted foot

18:38.726 --> 18:41.685
and ankle specialist. You want
to do this?

18:41.729 --> 18:43.383
- Yes.
- All right.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.472
Although this is a high
risk case because

18:45.515 --> 18:47.169
the potential to disrupt

18:47.213 --> 18:49.171
the blood supply to Destiny's
flap and have

18:49.215 --> 18:52.479
the whole thing necrosis
and die is high.

18:52.522 --> 18:55.177
I think I'm really interested
in helping her

18:55.221 --> 18:58.485
because she's 19. She's
got a long way to go

18:58.528 --> 19:02.576
and it's affecting her both
functionally and cosmetically.

19:02.619 --> 19:05.535
It does look like a testicle
a little bit, I must say.

19:15.763 --> 19:18.374
Oh, my God,
look at all these paints.

19:18.418 --> 19:21.290
I'’ve got some ideas, how you
want to beautify this canvas.

19:21.334 --> 19:25.294
I just want to make sure we get
like every part of my body,

19:25.338 --> 19:28.732
Okay. Because every part is art.
I love art.

19:28.776 --> 19:31.431
I consider my body
a work of art.

19:31.474 --> 19:34.738
I mean, look at my nails,
I created these.

19:34.782 --> 19:38.873
When you paint me, we, we got to
make sure this is when we

19:39.221 --> 19:41.484
put on the canvas so it
doesn't look lopsided.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.617
The right titty is the wrong
titty.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.227
No, the left titty is the right
titty.

19:45.271 --> 19:46.837
If I'’m a sexy vamptress,

19:46.881 --> 19:50.145
then Ian would be my
latest victim.

19:54.541 --> 19:59.763
It'’s complicated with me and
Ian, he'’s like my situationship.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.852
Damn, that sh--
sounds good on your butt.

20:01.896 --> 20:05.334
Hear that? It'’s like
somebody'’s slapping that sh--.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.336
I'’m hoping Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow

20:07.380 --> 20:11.253
help me achieve my titty
perfection.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.255
I need my areolas to
be symmetrical.

20:14.952 --> 20:19.566
And right now I'’m at 1150 CCs.
I'’m hoping to reach 2000 CCs.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.441
Anakaliyah,
she'’s a sexy vamptress,

20:25.485 --> 20:28.270
I'’m like the corpse that she
sucks a lot of blood out of.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.666
I'’m going to call this a
masterpiece. It'’s art.

20:38.802 --> 20:39.934
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.631
How are you feeling?

20:41.675 --> 20:43.894
I'’m feeling good,
feeling anxious,

20:43.938 --> 20:45.592
but I'’m ready to go.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.289
Good, I like that, we'’re in.
All right.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.857
We'’ll see you in the operating
room.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.299
Today for Patia'’s surgery.

20:57.343 --> 21:00.476
I'’ll start by performing a
commissuroplasty by making

21:00.520 --> 21:03.000
an incision along the right
corner of her mouth, we'’ll cut

21:03.044 --> 21:06.308
and transect the muscle and
extend the two edges all

21:06.352 --> 21:08.658
the way to the corner to widen
the opening of her mouth.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.921
Next, we'’ll harvest some of her
own fat to transfer to

21:10.965 --> 21:13.968
the small depression on her
lower right side of her chin.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.710
Then I'’ll make an incision along
an old scar by her nasal

21:16.753 --> 21:19.756
labial fold, lift up the
skin graft in the pocket

21:19.800 --> 21:21.410
as much as possible.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.369
Lastly, I perform a
direct lip lift on

21:23.412 --> 21:25.458
the right side where she lost

21:25.501 --> 21:28.896
the most lip tissue to make her
lips look more symmetrical.

21:28.939 --> 21:31.594
So we'’re marking out for the
commissuroplasty,

21:31.638 --> 21:34.336
a pedicle of skin that
we're going to remove

21:34.380 --> 21:36.512
and we're going to bring this
down to what we call

21:36.556 --> 21:38.688
the inside of the mouth, called
the buccal mucosa.

21:38.732 --> 21:41.778
- This might be her natural lip.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:41.822 --> 21:44.781
I'’m going to make an incision
for the commissuroplasty.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.609
I don't want to pop
into the mouth.

21:46.653 --> 21:47.958
So we're going to take

21:48.307 --> 21:50.004
the muscle, stitch it to
its new corner.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.788
This is really important

21:51.832 --> 21:54.791
because this muscle
we'’re creating

21:54.835 --> 21:57.881
the new opening for her
lip should be.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.796
If I ruin that muscle
around the mouth

21:59.840 --> 22:02.799
or it's not able to be fixated
to the corner of the lip,

22:02.843 --> 22:04.888
the mouth function
will not work.

22:04.932 --> 22:08.501
And the lip will shorten.
Time for a little fat grafting

22:08.544 --> 22:10.851
All that does is
really just gives you

22:10.894 --> 22:12.940
that extra
bit of love. Let'’s look

22:12.983 --> 22:16.596
at the mouth real quick. So this
are all her bulkiness is.

22:16.639 --> 22:19.816
So let'’s see if we can address
this, got to just be careful.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.992
I don't want to do
too much to it.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.038
Oh, I like that.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.563
Hopefully with me debulking
that upper flap,

22:27.607 --> 22:29.435
it'’s going to look a lot
better, now, what

22:29.478 --> 22:32.786
I need to do is start
reconstructing the upper lip.

22:32.829 --> 22:37.486
All right. So we'’re just doing
what we call a direct lip lift

22:37.530 --> 22:40.054
on the right side, just
to get the border

22:40.097 --> 22:43.666
a little bit more symmetric
with the left side here.

22:43.710 --> 22:47.540
In simplest terms, a direct lip
lift is removing a piece of

22:47.583 --> 22:51.500
the white skin and then taking
this red lip, advancing it,

22:51.544 --> 22:54.590
filling in that space to create
more red showing on

22:54.634 --> 22:58.594
the outside. Let'’s just see
this part here. Hold on.

22:58.638 --> 23:01.423
I just want to think about
this lip for it.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.687
As I'm in the process of
raising Patia's right lip.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.646
I keep looking over
to the left side

23:06.689 --> 23:09.518
and thinking maybe your lip
would be more aesthetically

23:09.562 --> 23:12.086
pleasing if I gave her more
red lip on the left

23:12.434 --> 23:15.002
as well by doing a
complete lip lift.

23:15.045 --> 23:18.048
That'’s going to be an incredible
look. We'’re just making

23:18.092 --> 23:21.443
it look perfect. And let'’s
see how it looks.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.663
Wow,
that's friggin' beautiful.

23:23.706 --> 23:26.535
Patia is going to be really,
really happy with this.

23:26.579 --> 23:28.450
Okay, thank you guys.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.713
- Those are tendons.
- Am I in the safe zone?

23:30.757 --> 23:32.106
Yeah, you are.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.803
One of my main concerns
with doing

23:33.847 --> 23:36.502
the direct excision is
that I may cut any of

23:36.545 --> 23:39.069
the ligament responsible for
your ability to walk.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.984
So look at this.

23:41.028 --> 23:44.597
I did fat transfer
to my outer lips, when you wear

23:44.640 --> 23:45.902
like sexy things, you see

23:45.946 --> 23:47.469
it'’s like a cute camel toe.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.819
Is that like a thing?
Go with the toe.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.778
Go, go toe or--

24:04.921 --> 24:07.315
So should we give it a moment
of silence for the ball sack?

24:09.535 --> 24:13.190
Let'’s just look at it a little
bit, say our final goodbyes.

24:13.234 --> 24:15.541
We're very nervous. She's
making all the decisions

24:15.584 --> 24:17.543
for herself this time.

24:17.586 --> 24:20.502
We'’re just basically here to
care for her, love on her.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.330
We're just hopeful that

24:22.373 --> 24:25.333
the outcome is something
that she'’s happy with.

24:25.376 --> 24:28.075
Hey, guys, how are you?

24:28.118 --> 24:32.383
He not only is a specialist
in foot and ankle surgery,

24:32.427 --> 24:35.343
he'’s also, was my best man
and I was his best man.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.519
So way back.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.956
Obviously, the reason I wanted
him here is because this is

24:40.000 --> 24:42.568
a very specific situation with

24:42.611 --> 24:45.614
a lot of potential pitfalls
that I want to avoid.

24:45.962 --> 24:48.530
It's a no brainer to have him
here and I need him here.

24:53.622 --> 24:55.406
Today for Destiny's surgery,

24:55.450 --> 24:57.452
we will begin by making
a decision along

24:57.496 --> 25:00.194
the medial side of her foot
and carefully opening up

25:00.237 --> 25:02.544
the flap. Next, we will debulk

25:02.588 --> 25:06.374
the flap by cutting away some of
the fat pad and cauterizing

25:06.417 --> 25:09.986
the tissue so it hopefully won'’t
grow back, then we will

25:10.030 --> 25:11.422
remove the excess skin,

25:11.466 --> 25:13.250
leaving Destiny with
a functional

25:13.294 --> 25:15.165
and nice cosmetic result.

25:15.209 --> 25:18.560
So we agree to open up the
medial side, the inner side.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.562
Right, because we don't want
to make an incision over

25:20.606 --> 25:22.651
- the heel if we can help it.
- That's right.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.392
Because then she'll walk.
All right.

25:24.435 --> 25:25.611
So I like
where that incision is,

25:25.654 --> 25:27.482
it shouldn'’t really bother her.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.397
Scarred up fat, isn'’t it?

25:29.440 --> 25:31.660
Well, it'’s not only scarred from
the original surgery,

25:31.704 --> 25:36.012
but from the liposuction
she's had in the past.

25:36.056 --> 25:38.232
And I like the thickness
of that. That's pretty good.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.408
You know, those are the
tendons, underneath.

25:40.451 --> 25:43.498
- So am I in the safe zone here?
- Yeah, you are.

25:43.542 --> 25:47.284
One of my main concerns with
doing the direct excision with

25:47.328 --> 25:49.286
the scissors is that
I may cut one of

25:49.330 --> 25:52.333
the critical structures within
the foot, for example,

25:52.376 --> 25:55.466
any of the ligament structures
of the foot responsible

25:55.510 --> 25:57.381
for your ability to walk.

25:57.425 --> 26:00.428
That's why I'm glad I have
Dr. Foreman here to guide me

26:00.471 --> 26:03.170
and hopefully keep me out of
harm's way.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.653
Okay, so look at this.

26:08.001 --> 26:11.178
Wow, look how much lax
skin there is,

26:11.221 --> 26:13.615
Should we call
plastic surgeons to repair this?

26:13.659 --> 26:15.704
It'’s a good idea.

26:16.052 --> 26:18.533
We'’re obviously going to leave
residual fat pad.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.405
But if you cauterize it,

26:21.449 --> 26:25.671
the chances that it will
actually grow fat--

26:25.714 --> 26:28.238
- Because you'’re killing it.
- You're scarifying it.

26:28.282 --> 26:29.762
It is a pretty elegant way of
doing it.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.633
What I'’m trying to do

26:31.677 --> 26:34.680
with Destiny'’s flap by using
electric cautery to burn

26:34.723 --> 26:38.771
a disconnection, a wall of scar
tissue, between the fat in

26:38.814 --> 26:42.078
the flap and the surrounding
lower extremity tissue.

26:42.122 --> 26:45.299
If I can do that, I can prevent
that fat potentially from

26:45.342 --> 26:46.692
coming back again.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.432
You want to
start tailoring the skin?

26:48.476 --> 26:50.652
- Yes.
- It'’s going to be just this.

26:50.696 --> 26:53.786
Like a tummy
tuck of the heel. Staple?

26:53.829 --> 26:56.702
Let'’s close it up, baby. Yeah.

26:56.745 --> 27:00.401
I think the big question mark
is, will that skin survive?

27:00.444 --> 27:02.751
Because we really
took out all of

27:02.795 --> 27:04.666
the excess bulgy tissue.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.537
- Cases you don'’t do every day.
- Yeah.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.329
We have an interesting patient
named Anakaliyah.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.157
She's got two issues.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.160
One, she wants to consider
going bigger, and two,

27:20.203 --> 27:22.728
her areola has become displaced.

27:23.076 --> 27:26.122
Can you please
send in Anakaliyah?

27:26.166 --> 27:30.431
Whoa, hi, I'’m Dr Nassif.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.346
Real pleasure to meet you.

27:32.389 --> 27:36.263
- Ian.
- Ian. Welcome. Yes.

27:36.306 --> 27:39.179
First of all, interesting name,
pretty name. What do you do?

27:39.222 --> 27:41.747
I consider myself like
a sexy vamptress.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.749
- Like Elvira.
- Like Elvira?

27:43.792 --> 27:45.489
Yes,
she'’s awesome.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.362
- She's got a narrow waist.
- Yes, yes, yes.

27:48.405 --> 27:50.843
And she has the fangs,
I have fangs too.

27:50.886 --> 27:56.675
Fangs. Let me see. You have
like two on each side. Wow.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.765
I just like to put a little
edge on everything.

28:00.113 --> 28:02.245
What'’s your relationship if
you don'’t mind my asking?

28:02.289 --> 28:05.771
- He'’s my partner in crime.
- Friends with benefits.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.729
I want no commitment.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.862
I'’m the one that doesn't want
commitment.

28:09.905 --> 28:13.082
She might take my life. But it
might be worth it at the end.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.563
We know you'’re here
for your breasts,

28:15.606 --> 28:17.783
but would you mind taking us
back and telling us about

28:17.826 --> 28:20.220
the evolution of the
enhancements that you'’ve done.

28:20.263 --> 28:23.745
My first was my breast
augmentation when I was 18.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.399
How big did you go
the first time?

28:25.442 --> 28:27.531
500 CC. And then
I had my second.

28:27.575 --> 28:29.403
That was 700 silicone.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.753
Then I did my 800 CCs.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.624
Then I did my rib removal.

28:33.668 --> 28:36.366
- Did it narrow your waist?
- It did like two inches.

28:36.410 --> 28:38.629
So then I moved on to
obliques suturing.

28:38.673 --> 28:41.545
- You're kidding me.
- Obliques suturing?

28:41.589 --> 28:43.722
How many inches did you get
from that?

28:43.765 --> 28:45.549
Maybe like
an inch and a half.

28:45.593 --> 28:48.857
But it gave me more of
the dent. Yes.

28:49.205 --> 28:51.860
More of that pulling
in there. So yeah.

28:52.208 --> 28:55.298
Wow. The abdominal wall
is composed of

28:55.342 --> 28:58.388
the central muscles called
the rectus muscles and

28:58.432 --> 29:01.261
the side muscles called
the obliques.

29:01.304 --> 29:05.787
The problem with Anakaliyah
sewing up those muscles,

29:05.831 --> 29:08.616
those muscles are directly
responsible

29:08.659 --> 29:11.271
for your ability to breathe.

29:11.314 --> 29:14.622
She's really lucky you didn't
impair her ability

29:14.665 --> 29:18.408
to breathe normally.
Then what?

29:18.452 --> 29:21.324
- Designer vagina.
- What is a designer vagina?

29:21.368 --> 29:25.764
Okay, so I did fat transfer
to my outer lips.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.461
- And you like that?
- Yes.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.550
What does
that do to the look of it?

29:29.593 --> 29:32.727
When you wear like sexy things,
you see like a cute camel toe.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.425
Camel. Okay,
you want to like show

29:35.469 --> 29:36.731
the camel toe these days?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.428
Is that a thing,
like go with

29:38.472 --> 29:40.822
the toe? Go toe or?

29:40.866 --> 29:42.955
I know this is
a stupid question.

29:42.998 --> 29:48.917
So a camel toe is basically
a puffy vagina

29:48.961 --> 29:50.832
that you can actually see
the groove when

29:50.876 --> 29:52.486
- you'’re wearing tight clothes.
- Yes.

29:52.529 --> 29:54.836
Yeah. Basically it looks
like a camel's toe.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.840
Yeah. I really didn't know
exactly what a camel toe meant.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.843
Now I do. I don't think
everyone should go

30:01.887 --> 30:03.627
with the trend.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.412
Okay, so then you had another
breast surgery.

30:05.455 --> 30:09.329
Yes, I took out the 800s
and then I got expanders.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.853
It was a tissue expander with
the pore so you can add it.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.507
How many different
times did they add it?

30:13.550 --> 30:14.943
I have only done
one fill since then.

30:15.291 --> 30:17.598
So now I'm at a 1150.

30:17.641 --> 30:18.904
So what's the goal?

30:19.252 --> 30:21.907
2,000. I'm trying
to get to 2,000.

30:21.950 --> 30:25.606
But you're here because your
tissue expansion process has

30:25.649 --> 30:27.564
changed your areola positions.

30:27.608 --> 30:30.480
- This one's going that way.
- That's the issue.

30:30.524 --> 30:31.960
Like I don't like that it's
pointing over there.

30:32.308 --> 30:33.962
What do you think about
her nipple issue?

30:34.310 --> 30:36.356
I mean, I definitely want to be
sucking on titties from

30:36.399 --> 30:40.751
the left or side.
Oh no, nobody wants that.

30:40.795 --> 30:42.579
You know?

30:44.538 --> 30:46.018
What?

30:46.061 --> 30:48.672
Gently for me, open
your mouth just gently.

30:48.716 --> 30:51.893
So you don'’t have microstomia
anymore.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.417
He has macrostomia, also
known as Big Mouth,

30:54.461 --> 30:56.550
Stop.

30:56.593 --> 31:00.554
Ladies and gentlemen, we'’re
going to put leeches on it.

31:00.597 --> 31:02.686
It'’s all fun and games until

31:02.730 --> 31:05.602
the whole thing
turns black and dies.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.256
Are you taking a selfie?

31:13.959 --> 31:18.920
I think I better call my wife.
Honey. This is my wife, Heather.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.530
Hi, Heather.

31:20.574 --> 31:23.882
Did you know that having
a camel toe now, is actually

31:23.925 --> 31:27.189
a thing? It'’s a fashion feature.
Are you aware of this?

31:27.233 --> 31:30.410
To me a camel toe,
is a UTI or a yeast infection

31:30.453 --> 31:31.977
waiting to happen.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.240
Oh, so it's
a medical condition.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.506
Oh, God. Well, you know
what they say.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.943
If you have a camel toe
you may have a fun guy.

31:43.945 --> 31:46.121
I'm with the bro.
I'm going with the toe.

31:48.254 --> 31:53.172
Okay, there's a lot to unpack
when it comes to uneven areolas

31:53.215 --> 31:56.915
and nipples. So this one's
starting to go this way, okay?

31:56.958 --> 31:59.482
Your body has decided to expand

31:59.526 --> 32:03.225
the inner part of your mound
more than your outer part.

32:03.269 --> 32:06.576
So it's preferentially expanding
this more with

32:06.620 --> 32:11.930
each fill. Okay, so predictably,
if you continue to expand,

32:11.973 --> 32:14.019
it will expand that
inner portion more

32:14.062 --> 32:16.412
and predictably will
force it this way.

32:16.456 --> 32:21.417
You can't make a mound position
changed to correct the areola

32:21.461 --> 32:26.118
deviation. The only way to
do that is to remove areolar

32:26.161 --> 32:30.383
skin in the inner portion
to try to move

32:30.426 --> 32:33.952
the aerial over that way.
That's not a thing.

32:35.344 --> 32:40.045
It won'’t work because you can
make changes in areola position

32:40.088 --> 32:42.134
in the vertical, but you can't
make it horizontal

32:42.177 --> 32:45.615
because it tends to distort
the areola, so it

32:45.659 --> 32:50.098
looks like this. I think you
should stay where you are.

32:50.142 --> 32:51.534
Take these expanders out,

32:51.882 --> 32:53.536
because they're not designed
to stay forever.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.582
They will rupture because
they're not made with

32:55.930 --> 32:59.238
the same thickness testing
standards as

32:59.281 --> 33:00.456
a real breast implant.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.284
I'm very thankful that

33:02.328 --> 33:03.938
the doctors gave me
this information.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.462
I do take their opinions
to value,

33:06.506 --> 33:09.117
but I'’m probably going
to get another fill

33:09.161 --> 33:13.992
and see how my areolas
react to that.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.341
I don't know.
Just keep in mind,

33:15.384 --> 33:16.995
every time you put a
needle in there,

33:17.038 --> 33:18.605
your chance of infection
starts to go up.

33:18.953 --> 33:20.607
You know, you push
the envelope and

33:20.955 --> 33:22.478
the envelope is accepting it.

33:22.522 --> 33:24.480
- Seal it.
- Seal the envelope.

33:24.524 --> 33:26.961
Maybe focus on the camel
toe thing.

33:28.528 --> 33:31.357
If your wife showed
up to go out to dinner

33:31.400 --> 33:34.664
and you noticed a prominent
camel toe, you'd say,

33:34.708 --> 33:37.232
we're not going to the zoo,
we're going to dinner.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.194
That'’s what you would
say to Heather.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.376
How're you feeling? Good?

33:50.419 --> 33:54.032
I feel good. I'’m excited to
see what they have to say.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.555
Even with the swelling
and everything,

33:55.598 --> 33:57.557
it looks like
you have a new mouth.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.254
I know
it's incredible.

33:59.298 --> 34:01.126
Like, you can totally
see the difference.

34:03.954 --> 34:06.131
- Hey, how are you?
- Good. How are you doing?

34:06.174 --> 34:08.350
- Hello, you two.
- I'’m doing great.

34:08.394 --> 34:10.048
All right. Let me just
take this down

34:12.398 --> 34:13.921
Head back for me.

34:15.009 --> 34:17.316
Okay. Yeah you opened that
way up.

34:17.359 --> 34:19.448
So this looks nice and smooth,
remember that was

34:19.492 --> 34:22.669
full, this is swollen.
Watch this side

34:22.712 --> 34:24.410
looks incredible,
and this side.

34:24.453 --> 34:27.543
Alright, gently for me,
open your mouth.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.070
Super good. You'’re
beautiful right now,

34:32.113 --> 34:33.549
really happy with the way it
looks now.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.160
Yeah. Me too.

34:35.203 --> 34:37.379
I just want you to heal
like that.

34:37.423 --> 34:40.382
So, so far, our journey
is successful.

34:40.426 --> 34:43.081
Part two is going
to be your healing.

34:43.124 --> 34:45.561
Part three is going to be the
medical permanent tattoo.

34:45.605 --> 34:49.304
I'm in shock. I've been
in shock for the last day

34:49.348 --> 34:51.698
or two about
how great it looks.

34:51.741 --> 34:54.048
I mean, I'm really,
really impressed.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.658
It's just amazing. Like,

34:55.702 --> 34:59.532
I can actually see myself
again and it's incredible.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.404
I'm just excited
for my life moving forward

35:02.448 --> 35:06.147
and not being embarrassed
about the way I look.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.323
You know, you ever hear
the word microstomia?

35:08.367 --> 35:12.284
It means where your
mouth is not normal size,

35:12.327 --> 35:15.069
you don'’t have
microstomia anymore.

35:15.113 --> 35:20.248
He has macrostomia,
also known as Big Mouth.

35:22.642 --> 35:25.253
Oh, dude, you'’re going to
ruin it, don'’t do that.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.699
- Hello.
- Hello, everybody.

35:36.743 --> 35:39.615
- Hello you two.
- So I made the incision,

35:39.659 --> 35:41.226
I lifted everything up,

35:41.269 --> 35:43.489
and we carefully removed
as much tissue

35:43.532 --> 35:46.535
as we could that we felt
was safe to give you

35:46.579 --> 35:49.495
the contour you want
and try to keep

35:49.538 --> 35:51.323
the blood supply intact.

35:51.366 --> 35:53.716
This is a very large
skin flap that has

35:53.760 --> 35:58.286
the real potential to turn
purple and then black and die.

35:58.330 --> 36:01.289
What I'm hoping to see
is viable pink,

36:01.333 --> 36:03.378
healthy tissue with
good blood flow,

36:03.422 --> 36:05.772
which means surviving
and thriving.

36:05.815 --> 36:07.643
It'’s like unwrapping presents.

36:07.687 --> 36:10.037
- I hope it'’s a good present.
- Yeah, me too.

36:16.130 --> 36:18.698
This is exactly what I
don'’t want to see. So I took

36:18.741 --> 36:21.440
that deep breath because this is
very nerve wracking for us.

36:21.483 --> 36:23.659
Purple is a little something
that I'm used to dealing with.

36:23.703 --> 36:27.794
I can definitely see the flap
does look very purple and scary.

36:28.142 --> 36:29.709
I'’m concerned.

36:29.752 --> 36:33.800
When it'’s purple
like this that indicates that

36:34.148 --> 36:37.673
it's more blood having
trouble getting out.

36:37.717 --> 36:42.200
We would like to be able to
somehow suck the blood out of

36:42.243 --> 36:44.637
the skin like a vampire.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.769
Wait are you going to put
leeches on it?

36:46.813 --> 36:50.512
Ladies and gentlemen, we'’re
going to put leeches on it.

36:50.556 --> 36:53.254
We don't want this to croak.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.343
It's all fun and games

36:55.387 --> 36:58.694
until the whole thing
turns black and dies.

36:58.738 --> 37:00.783
Hi.

37:02.742 --> 37:05.484
It'’s going to be so gross.
I don'’t like bugs.

37:05.527 --> 37:08.182
I don't like little insects.
I just feel weird.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.446
It looks like a worm.
I don'’t want to look.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.536
Just seeing the leeches
latch on.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.190
It was just disgusting.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.757
They like
to sit close to each other.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.804
They kind of compete,
very interesting animals

37:21.848 --> 37:25.547
Maybe they look crazy,
but they do amazing work.

37:25.591 --> 37:30.552
Oh. Honey, don'’t worry, I'm
here. Perfect, perfect.

37:30.596 --> 37:32.380
Are you taking a selfie?

37:35.383 --> 37:37.298
Leeches are doing a really
good job for us because

37:37.342 --> 37:41.259
the flap is slowly changing from
purple to pink, viable,

37:41.302 --> 37:42.651
healthy tissue.

37:42.695 --> 37:45.437
That is so fun,
I love that.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.352
But we're not out of
the woods yet.

37:47.395 --> 37:50.311
We need blood to continue to
go in and out of the flap.

37:50.355 --> 37:53.401
And I need to make sure we
do everything we can

37:53.445 --> 37:57.884
postoperatively to continue this
early positive progress.

37:58.232 --> 38:01.931
- You're awesome. Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

38:01.975 --> 38:03.759
- Wow.
- That thing is huge.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.457
You guys see this
masterpiece?

38:05.500 --> 38:06.936
I love it.
It looks great.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.634
We have to
go shoe shopping, Dad.

38:08.677 --> 38:11.463
- You get a summer job.
- A summer job.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.769
- Are you nervous?
- I'm so excited.

38:13.813 --> 38:17.251
Patia looks great. Such a
magnificent transformation.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.209
- Okay.
- Don'’t start crying.

38:19.993 --> 38:21.647
No, no, she's not.

38:29.176 --> 38:31.744
When I look back and just
see what it took

38:31.787 --> 38:33.354
for me to get to where
I'm at today,

38:33.702 --> 38:35.313
having three surgeries
on my heel,

38:35.661 --> 38:37.358
then I have to live with
the entire ball sack

38:37.402 --> 38:41.144
on my foot. It was embarrassing
and it caused me pain

38:41.188 --> 38:43.364
and deep insecurities
within myself.

38:43.408 --> 38:48.326
♪ This is my destiny

38:48.369 --> 38:50.937
Now, my foot is just perfection.

38:50.980 --> 38:53.896
I'’m going out barefoot or I'm
going to wear some sexy heels,

38:53.940 --> 38:55.811
and I don't have to
look around me

38:55.855 --> 38:57.900
and see people looking at me
or taking photos of me.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.728
I no longer look at
my gym shoes anymore.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.948
Those are like in the
back of the closet.

39:01.991 --> 39:04.907
I have new shoes and I'’m just
living life. Walking barefoot

39:04.951 --> 39:07.345
at the beach feels like
I have freedom

39:07.388 --> 39:11.174
and it feels ----ing awesome.
You guys see this masterpiece?

39:11.218 --> 39:13.786
- I love it. It looks great.
- It's so pretty.

39:13.829 --> 39:16.136
You know, I'’m so proud of you
that you went through this whole

39:16.179 --> 39:19.008
process and now not having to
hide it from anybody.

39:19.052 --> 39:20.967
Before my surgery
with Dr. Dubrow,

39:21.010 --> 39:24.362
I had a skin flap on my right
heel that had grown into

39:24.710 --> 39:28.104
a bulging hairy abnormality.
Thanks to Dr. Dubrow.

39:28.148 --> 39:32.152
I have a beautiful ball sack
free foot, thank God.

39:32.195 --> 39:33.980
Do you feel like

39:34.023 --> 39:35.982
you'’re missing something like
since it'’s gone?

39:36.025 --> 39:38.811
No, it was time.

39:38.854 --> 39:40.769
It was time to remove it.

39:40.813 --> 39:43.119
- She'’s just glowing.
- It kind of actually scares me

39:43.163 --> 39:45.905
because now it's like she's not
that timid about going out

39:45.948 --> 39:47.994
anywhere. And now
she wants to, like,

39:48.037 --> 39:50.213
go and explore the world and
go out and, you know,

39:50.257 --> 39:53.913
have fun. And it's like you.
Okay, let's go back to

39:53.956 --> 39:55.436
where you were before.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.090
You never see me in
the house anymore.

39:57.133 --> 39:59.832
- I don'’t bring it down a notch?
- No.

39:59.875 --> 40:04.402
So I have a boyfriend
and it'’s cute.

40:06.055 --> 40:09.015
- That's what's going on.
- That was holding you back.

40:09.058 --> 40:11.844
That ball sack.
But now it'’s like

40:11.887 --> 40:15.891
- you got a tuck.
- A ball sack talk.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.850
Now that it'’s gone,

40:17.893 --> 40:21.027
I can just grow as a happy girl
and living life the way

40:21.070 --> 40:22.463
I should have been doing.

40:22.507 --> 40:24.160
We had to
go shoe shopping, Dad.

40:24.204 --> 40:26.032
- You get a summer job.
- A summer job?

40:30.515 --> 40:34.388
- Hello.
- Hello. Hello.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.870
Let's take a look. First of all,
you look incredible open.

40:37.913 --> 40:40.481
So this thing really
opened up a lot.

40:40.829 --> 40:42.483
I ate a burger.

40:42.527 --> 40:45.443
Patia looks great. Such
a magnificent transformation.

40:45.791 --> 40:47.880
- Are you nervous?
- I'm so excited.

40:47.923 --> 40:52.537
You should be. And this medical
tattoo is the final step.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.887
All right. Ready?
Don'’t start crying.

40:56.802 --> 40:58.499
No, no, she'’s numb.
She'’s going to be good.

40:58.847 --> 41:02.460
Looking back from the way I felt
when this first happened,

41:02.808 --> 41:05.506
I didn't look the same anymore.
It took away my identity.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.465
It took away who I was.

41:07.813 --> 41:11.860
Now, since Dr. Nassif has
done the surgery,

41:11.904 --> 41:14.297
my life has changed so much.

41:16.082 --> 41:17.823
Get set and go!

41:19.477 --> 41:20.521
It'’s incredible.

41:20.869 --> 41:23.959
- Bravo.
- Congratulations.

41:27.093 --> 41:31.489
Yeah, it's crazy. I see my old
face coming through now

41:31.532 --> 41:33.491
and it's an amazing feeling.

41:41.890 --> 41:45.894
Wow, babe, it smells amazing.
What are you cooking?

41:45.938 --> 41:47.548
We'’ve got some good ribs
here for you today.

41:47.896 --> 41:51.117
- Oh, I'’m so excited.
- I think Patia looks beautiful.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.512
It feels great to know that you
can take bites of anything

41:54.555 --> 41:57.123
I cook or going out
to a restaurant

41:57.166 --> 41:58.907
and her feeling comfortable
about eating.

41:58.951 --> 42:02.520
It just makes me excited
about the future.

42:02.563 --> 42:05.305
I don'’t even care
if I get all messy. Yes?

42:07.350 --> 42:10.963
Before my surgery, my face
looked like a Halloween mask.

42:11.006 --> 42:14.532
I had almost lost my entire
lip to cancer.

42:14.880 --> 42:17.143
It was scarred and tight and

42:17.186 --> 42:20.494
I didn't even recognize myself
when I looked in the mirror.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.149
But now,
thanks to Dr. Nassif,

42:23.192 --> 42:27.327
I can open my mouth more
and I have lips.

42:27.370 --> 42:29.329
I can kiss my husband now.

42:29.372 --> 42:31.636
We'’re definitely getting
better lip action in.

42:31.679 --> 42:34.639
And it'’s friggin' amazing.
Just at work

42:34.682 --> 42:36.641
the other day they were saying,
oh, yay,

42:36.684 --> 42:38.512
we have our old Patia back.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.602
So that was really great to hear
because being the face of

42:41.646 --> 42:44.257
the company, you have to
have your best game.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.346
It'll only get better from here.

42:46.389 --> 42:49.349
I agree. I do find myself going
to the mirror just to smile,

42:49.392 --> 42:52.395
just to see like, oh, look at
you, girl. You're smiling again.

42:54.920 --> 42:57.052
Show me your sexy smile,
let me see, oh, yeah,

42:57.096 --> 42:58.488
there you go.

42:58.532 --> 43:01.100
Come here and give me
a big dirty kiss.

43:03.363 --> 43:07.106
She has a very significant
animation deformity that could

43:07.149 --> 43:10.239
occur when you're undergoing the
male to female transition.

43:10.283 --> 43:12.372
I'm a pricey bitch and
I don't care if you

43:12.415 --> 43:13.634
don't like me bitch.

43:13.982 --> 43:15.680
I think
I'm kind of a cheap bitch.

43:15.723 --> 43:18.117
I have no clue what the
doctor did here.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.032
I just think my nose
look like a chicken butt

43:20.075 --> 43:21.599
I don'’t know
what a chicken butt looks like.

43:21.642 --> 43:23.209
I know what
a chicken butt looks like.

43:23.252 --> 43:25.385
I hit my left knee
on a rock ledge.

43:25.428 --> 43:28.649
This is medical negligence.
You only have about two hours.

43:28.693 --> 43:31.565
- Ten minute warning.
- Where you can kill the leg.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.262
It's really tough.
