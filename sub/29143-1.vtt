Stay awake, Rick.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.167
Stay awake.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.389
Stay awake, Rick.

00:48.918 --> 00:52.095
The world record, 11 days.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.836
Eleven days.

Stay awake, Rick.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.057
You can do it.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.105
I'm watching you, Rick.

01:02.149 --> 01:04.498
Stay awake, or you're next.

01:05.587 --> 01:08.503
Stay awake, or you die.

01:08.546 --> 01:11.462
You'll wind up in hell
like all the others.

01:12.507 --> 01:14.161
Save the children, Rick.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.425
Save the children.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.775
You are worthless. Give up.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.125
Give up!

01:22.169 --> 01:23.605
Save the children.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.824
Give up!

01:25.868 --> 01:27.715
- You failed your job.
- Rick, I'm right here!

01:27.739 --> 01:30.002
- You failed your job.
- Come on, Rick!

01:30.046 --> 01:32.440
I'm here!
Can you even hear me, Rick?

01:32.483 --> 01:34.006
Save the children.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.051
Talk to me!

01:36.008 --> 01:37.140
Please, talk to me.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.404
Sleep,
and I'll kill you.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.178
Hey!

05:39.861 --> 05:42.907
You remember Mr. Larabee
from Clamorant Media?

05:44.213 --> 05:46.258
Well, well,
enter the feudal lords.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.915
We need to talk numbers.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.702
You are.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.114
You've been
on the fringe for too long.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.574
Your slot's going Top 40.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.054
You new owners, you're just...

05:59.097 --> 06:01.273
I don't do Top 40.

06:01.317 --> 06:03.624
Uh, I do the eclectic,
and it works.

06:03.667 --> 06:04.929
Pulse of New York.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.342
We want all nine million
listeners of the city.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.604
Not just a sliver
out in Williamsburg

06:07.628 --> 06:08.672
that feeds your ego.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.892
My ego?

06:10.935 --> 06:13.460
Was it my ego
that promotes undervalued artist

06:13.503 --> 06:16.332
instead of your processed
plastic bump and grind bands?

06:16.376 --> 06:17.656
We're not renewing
your contract.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.336
Not with these numbers.

06:20.989 --> 06:21.990
Not ever.

06:25.994 --> 06:29.301
Your ratings, they just need
to come up.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.087
Or you're done.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.186
Oh...

06:45.927 --> 06:47.450
Tough meeting, Rick, huh?

06:47.494 --> 06:48.886
Almost makes me believe

06:48.930 --> 06:51.454
that there's justice
in the universe after all.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.630
I never took you
for a dreamer, Marcus.

06:53.674 --> 06:56.111
Just a... Just a sore loser

06:56.154 --> 06:57.460
for not getting
the morning slot.

06:57.504 --> 06:58.940
Yeah?

06:58.983 --> 07:00.811
Well, I'm keeping
my slot, though.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.252
Fuck...

07:08.253 --> 07:11.343
Try that again, mother...

07:11.387 --> 07:13.520
Oh, Rick, um,
your wife's here.

07:13.563 --> 07:14.963
- She's looking for you.
- Oh, shit.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.046
Hey, sweetheart.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.569
What you doing here?

07:19.613 --> 07:21.528
Do you have any idea
how humiliating it is

07:21.571 --> 07:23.704
to show up to your first
marriage counseling session

07:23.747 --> 07:25.357
and get stood up
by your husband?

07:29.666 --> 07:31.233
Uh...

07:31.276 --> 07:33.191
It's just that I...

07:35.629 --> 07:37.282
I'll give you one more chance.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.807
- Okay?
- Okay.

07:39.850 --> 07:40.982
Okay.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.244
There's a...

07:42.287 --> 07:44.289
super exclusive marriage retreat

07:44.333 --> 07:45.726
in Newport
at the end of the month,

07:45.769 --> 07:46.988
and I want us to go.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.294
You know I...

07:49.338 --> 07:50.794
I had to pull a lot of strings
to get us in.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.012
- Mm-hm.
- And I just...

07:52.036 --> 07:54.125
Please, I just need you
to wanna go, okay?

07:55.692 --> 07:57.215
Yeah.

07:57.259 --> 07:58.390
I guess, yeah.

07:59.435 --> 08:00.436
You guess?

08:03.395 --> 08:05.485
God. Does it mean nothing
to you?

08:05.528 --> 08:08.400
How much sleep I have lost
worrying about us?

08:13.580 --> 08:15.756
You're losing sleep?
You're losing sleep?

08:15.799 --> 08:18.541
Yes, Rick, that's what I said.

08:20.848 --> 08:22.806
You're a genius.

08:22.850 --> 08:23.851
I gotta go, okay?

08:25.156 --> 08:27.419
The 28th, buddy!

08:27.463 --> 08:28.551
Remember that!

08:28.595 --> 08:30.248
Oh! Um, I was just...

08:31.511 --> 08:32.729
Sleep deprivation.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.688
- Get me intel.
- Yeah. Of course.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.167
Mm-hm.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.928
A stunt's not gonna raise
your ratings quick enough.

08:37.952 --> 08:41.085
No, no, no. A sleep deprivation
marathon would be great.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.106
What's the record on this thing?

08:45.481 --> 08:48.005
Two hundred
and sixty-four hours.

08:48.049 --> 08:50.268
That's 11 days awake.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.533
Whoa, 11 days?

08:53.576 --> 08:55.796
Seriously? Okay, 11 days it is.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.145
No harm in trying. Let's, uh...

08:57.188 --> 08:58.842
Let's make it
a charity fundraiser, huh?

08:58.886 --> 09:00.211
We'll, uh, we'll find
a disease or something.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.845
When might
this earthshaking

09:01.889 --> 09:03.760
slumber party happen?

09:05.501 --> 09:07.677
Somewhere around
the 28th would be perfect.

09:12.464 --> 09:15.642
We're doing a Wake-A-Thon
charity fundraiser.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.600
So, who's got me a disease?

09:17.644 --> 09:18.688
How about AIDS?

09:18.732 --> 09:20.211
No, too '90s. Next.

09:20.255 --> 09:21.493
How about breast cancer?

09:21.517 --> 09:23.606
- I don't like breast cancer.
- Nobody likes

09:23.650 --> 09:25.105
- breast cancer, Phil.
- Come on.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.740
Raise my eyebrows.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.698
Fibrocystic disease.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.178
It's another woman thing.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.614
- Is it fatal?
- No,

09:31.658 --> 09:33.070
- but that's... But...
- It has, it has to be fatal.

09:33.094 --> 09:36.140
It has to be something
that grabs people by the throat.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.447
It could be
in today's headlines.

09:38.490 --> 09:43.191
Dr. Harold Rance,
SMA researcher murdered.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.603
That's the dude
hanging from the bridge.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.027
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.084
- It just happened this morning.
- Yeah, his, his guts

09:47.108 --> 09:47.935
were like,
hanging all out, and...

09:47.978 --> 09:50.328
What's, uh... What's SMA?

09:50.372 --> 09:52.461
"Spinal Muscular Atrophy."

09:52.504 --> 09:55.377
"SMA is the number one
genetic killer of children.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.466
Victims never acquire
or progressively lose

09:57.509 --> 10:00.904
the ability to walk,
stand, or move.

10:00.948 --> 10:04.560
And, ultimately, fatal
respiratory complications.

10:05.561 --> 10:06.954
No known cure."

10:09.086 --> 10:11.567
And so, New York, with this Wake-A-Thon,

10:11.611 --> 10:14.526
SMA will feel the wrath
of Rick Weider.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.659
A webcam will show me awake
around the clock

10:16.703 --> 10:19.619
inside a glass booth
on the street in Times Square.

10:19.662 --> 10:23.361
Even bathroom breaks
will be strictly monitored.

10:23.405 --> 10:26.626
Keeping a watchful eye on me
will be Dr. Maurice Falco,

10:26.669 --> 10:29.063
eminent expert
in the field of sleep research.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.847
Any thoughts, doctor?

10:30.891 --> 10:33.937
This is not just a question
of mere physical endurance,

10:33.981 --> 10:37.506
for that would punish
only mortal flesh.

10:37.549 --> 10:41.728
It is rather an intense assault
on the mind,

10:41.771 --> 10:43.251
or dare I say,

10:43.294 --> 10:45.166
it's the soul...

10:45.209 --> 10:49.649
that denies a man
his deeply needed nightly escape

10:49.692 --> 10:53.348
from the horrors of this world.

10:53.391 --> 10:56.133
Sobering thoughts,
indeed, doctor.

10:56.177 --> 10:59.049
So, I'll be awake day and night,
night and day,

10:59.093 --> 11:01.530
starting October 24th.

11:01.573 --> 11:04.185
How long can I last?

11:04.228 --> 11:06.883
Four days? Five? A week?

11:06.927 --> 11:08.755
Or beyond?

11:08.798 --> 11:10.757
Stay tuned for news,
weather, and sports.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.631
Rick Weider.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.155
As an SMA parent,

11:18.199 --> 11:20.941
I can't tell you what this
Wake-A-Thon means.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.595
Oh, no. You're, uh,
you're expressing it fine.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.119
Well, it's great

11:25.162 --> 11:28.731
to hear a man as passionate
as yourself involved.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.908
Impossible is nothing
when it matters.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.562
After all,

11:33.605 --> 11:37.522
"A man's reach should always
exceed his grasp."

11:37.566 --> 11:39.263
"Or what's a heaven for?"

11:40.787 --> 11:42.702
Robert Browning.

11:42.745 --> 11:45.095
He's not quoted much.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.532
Yeah, and he didn't
really become popular

11:47.576 --> 11:49.970
until after he died.

11:50.013 --> 11:53.016
The world record, 11 days.

11:53.887 --> 11:54.931
Can you do it?

11:54.975 --> 11:57.064
Uh, it's, uh... It's daunting.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.936
But are you
committed to it?

11:59.980 --> 12:03.287
It would bring so much attention to our cause.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.246
Well, I'll, uh,
I'll certainly give it a try.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.771
It's a decision
of the will.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.774
Dedication.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.385
Dedication.

12:14.429 --> 12:17.388
That's what Dr. Rance
couldn't understand.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.783
Uh, wait, Rance, the...

12:20.827 --> 12:23.438
The dead guy on the bridge?

12:23.481 --> 12:24.589
He didn't care enough

12:24.613 --> 12:27.050
about what
he was leaving undone.

12:27.094 --> 12:28.965
That's why
we don't have a cure yet.

12:30.532 --> 12:33.361
We need dedicated warriors.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.536
Like yourself.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.627
So, how much money
will you raise?

12:40.020 --> 12:43.632
Uh, we, uh, we haven't set
a definite goal yet.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.547
- Millions.
- Millions?

12:45.590 --> 12:48.071
Uh, we'll be lucky
to get 20 grand, sir.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.857
Twenty grand.
Twenty grand.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.554
Twenty grand?

12:52.597 --> 12:55.035
Are you out of your mind?

12:55.078 --> 12:57.994
You need to have a bigger vision for this, Weider.

12:58.038 --> 13:00.083
Okay, why, why don't you give me
your number,

13:00.127 --> 13:01.321
and we'll orchestrate something?

13:01.345 --> 13:03.217
It'd be wonderful
if you could help us.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.442
Damn.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.836
- I think that was the killer.
- What killer?

13:13.880 --> 13:15.858
- That, that killer? The...
- The bridge killer.

13:15.882 --> 13:16.883
If...

13:16.926 --> 13:18.188
- Whoa.
- If...

13:18.232 --> 13:20.032
we could get this guy
to confess or something,

13:20.060 --> 13:21.539
we would be news!

13:21.583 --> 13:22.932
Co... confess?

13:22.976 --> 13:24.934
Rick, how is he
gonna confess on air?

13:24.978 --> 13:26.327
That's not gonna happen.
That's...

13:26.370 --> 13:28.024
- We should call the police.
- No.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.374
No, no, no.
We gotta milk it first.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.462
"Milk it"?

13:31.506 --> 13:33.638
Haven't I
taught you anything?

13:33.682 --> 13:34.988
- Not, not really.
- What the...

13:35.031 --> 13:36.859
- Right. Okay.
- We'll milk it.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.315
- Right. Do you wanna...
- Go back to school.

13:38.339 --> 13:39.403
- Go back to school, Miguel.
- We'll milk it. No...

13:39.427 --> 13:40.867
- We'll milk it.
- Go back to school.

13:51.308 --> 13:53.180
You son of a bitch.

13:53.223 --> 13:54.964
Don't tell me
you forgot the date.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.507
- Look, Kathy, I...
- Deliberately.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.359
You deliberately did that.

13:58.402 --> 13:59.795
No. Wait, wait, wait.
No. Hold it.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.623
You don't understand.
Uh, sorry, sir.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.974
My job is on the line,
my career, my whole...

14:05.018 --> 14:07.063
Now, I have a chance
to catch a killer on the air.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.196
- It could be huge!
- A killer?

14:09.239 --> 14:10.371
What are you talking about?

14:10.414 --> 14:11.938
Are you completely
delusional, Rick?

14:11.981 --> 14:13.330
All right, look, you're busy.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.550
Let's talk about it tonight
at home. All right?

14:16.638 --> 14:17.944
No, Rick. You know what,

14:17.987 --> 14:20.598
I'm gonna go stay
with my sister for a while.

14:20.642 --> 14:23.210
- I have to do some thinking.
- Oh, come on, really?

14:23.950 --> 14:25.038
You hate her.

14:26.387 --> 14:27.518
Good luck with your stunt.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.488
Good morning, New York.

14:40.531 --> 14:44.579
The great WZLW Wake-A-Thon
with me, Rick Weider, has begun.

14:44.622 --> 14:47.887
We are broadcasting live
from Times Square.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.192
Night and day, day and night,

14:49.236 --> 14:51.803
I'll be awake,
fighting the good fight for SMA.

14:51.847 --> 14:54.937
The number one
genetic killer of children.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.939
Now we need money for research,

14:56.983 --> 14:59.507
and I am going to stay awake,
as long as it takes,

14:59.550 --> 15:01.596
to convince you
to make a donation

15:01.639 --> 15:03.641
at StayAwakeRick.com.

15:03.685 --> 15:07.558
Let's do this, guys.
For all the SMA kids.

Wake up!

15:47.120 --> 15:51.037
The study of sleep deprivation
is not bedtime reading.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.126
The rats' brains hemorrhaged.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.911
The American
Medical Journal, 1965.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.739
But it didn't include,

15:57.782 --> 15:59.959
the rats
ate their own tails first.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.311
A Wake-A-Thon?

16:04.354 --> 16:05.794
You'll be asleep
before the first day

16:05.834 --> 16:07.531
of this circus is over.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.533
Oh, and by the way,

16:09.577 --> 16:11.796
guess who's gonna be getting
the morning slot?

16:15.583 --> 16:16.714
Rick Weider.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.038
Let me ask you
something.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.153
Oh, hey.
Uh, thanks for calling back.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.869
Let me, uh, let me get
your name and number

16:21.893 --> 16:23.547
in case
we get disconnected again.

16:23.591 --> 16:25.723
You are going to reach
for something.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.856
- Right, Rick?
- Yeah, man, I'm reaching.

16:27.899 --> 16:30.163
You, uh, you mentioned
the doctor before.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.705
- The doctor that...
- You've got to give them

16:31.729 --> 16:34.167
more substance than sensation.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.909
Honestly convey your passion to your listeners.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.365
Uh-huh. You're right.
The human element.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.565
So with you. So, tell me, you...

16:41.609 --> 16:43.785
Stop yessing me,
Weider!

16:43.828 --> 16:46.614
You're not expecting enough
from your listeners!

16:46.657 --> 16:48.355
You have no idea
what they're capable of

16:48.398 --> 16:49.965
if they can believe in you.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.967
Be real! Be honest!

16:52.011 --> 16:55.057
They will rise up in solidarity with our cause,

16:55.101 --> 16:57.016
and we will triumph!

16:57.059 --> 17:00.062
Do not blow this!

17:01.455 --> 17:02.673
Dude.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.240
What the hell was that?

17:04.284 --> 17:07.113
Ah, he was just a prank caller.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.202
I take back what I said.

17:09.244 --> 17:11.030
This will be over by lunch.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.426
Rick. Rick?

17:18.689 --> 17:19.907
Rick!

17:19.951 --> 17:22.084
Um, this is Dr. Gray,
the SMA expert.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.131
Hello, doctor.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.436
Welcome.

17:27.481 --> 17:31.528
I'm moving out of SMA
into other fields of research.

17:31.572 --> 17:32.660
Oh.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.009
Oh, that's a shame.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.880
Joining me once again
is Dr. Gray,

17:35.924 --> 17:38.448
who has been illuminating us
on the subject of SMA.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.015
So, Dr. Gray,

17:40.059 --> 17:41.799
tell us more about the,

17:41.843 --> 17:45.716
the challenges of dealing
with this deadly disease.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.764
The families must face
difficult lifestyle decisions,

17:49.807 --> 17:52.288
uh, in order to make life
manageable

17:52.332 --> 17:54.725
for their children, and...

17:54.769 --> 17:59.034
of course, the specter of death
is always a burden to bear.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.122
Intricate stuff.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.472
Prognosis is tricky.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.735
Time-cost issues,

18:04.779 --> 18:06.041
parental expectations...

18:06.085 --> 18:08.304
For, for tangible results.

18:08.348 --> 18:10.132
Ta... Tangible results?

18:10.176 --> 18:11.699
To save a life.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.440
We need to find a cure.

18:13.483 --> 18:16.138
Uh, and you think Dr. Rance
was making headway?

18:16.182 --> 18:18.184
I mean, he died so suddenly.

18:18.227 --> 18:22.362
Were, were you working with him
toward that tangible result?

18:22.405 --> 18:23.841
That's a...

18:25.191 --> 18:27.018
That's difficult to go...

18:27.671 --> 18:29.151
...to go into.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.681
Oh, uh, we'll...
we'll be right back.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.119
I'm terribly sorry.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.424
I'm terribly sorry.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.731
Don't worry, man.
It's radio. No one saw it.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.317
Yeah, um...

18:45.341 --> 18:46.386
I've, uh...

18:46.429 --> 18:48.083
I've been under...

18:48.127 --> 18:49.998
tremendous stress.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.043
- Pharmacy is two blocks down.
- Oh, okay.

18:52.087 --> 18:53.697
I've, uh...

18:53.741 --> 18:55.482
I've been getting these...

18:55.525 --> 18:57.092
these terrible threats.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.539
That was... disgusting.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.498
Smile. It's for charity.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.067
WZLW Rick Weider.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.895
"Tangible result"?

19:17.939 --> 19:21.856
I'll give you a tangible result.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.225
He doesn't look healthy enough-It's that guy.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.598
to live anyway.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.382
- What?
- Yeah.

19:27.514 --> 19:30.125
You see him now?

19:30.169 --> 19:33.520
He definitely doesn't look like he's gonna make it.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.870
You gonna threaten
one of my guests now?

19:35.913 --> 19:38.307
Call this a lesson
in dedication.

19:38.351 --> 19:41.267
You're not gonna do anything.

19:41.310 --> 19:44.183
You're just another media-crazy,
celebrity ballbuster.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.620
- Get a life.
- Like Gray's?

19:46.663 --> 19:49.188
And when I'm finished
busting, Rick,

19:50.363 --> 19:52.147
you'll be a star.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.105
Go find Gray. Now.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.498
- Okay?
- What?

19:55.542 --> 19:56.649
- He's going to the pharmacy. Go!
- What's going on?

19:56.673 --> 19:58.109
Just please!

19:58.153 --> 19:59.565
- Tell me what's going on.
- Please go find Gray now!

19:59.589 --> 20:01.200
Go! Go!

20:03.114 --> 20:04.377
Okay, jokes over.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.030
Knock it off,
or I'm calling the police.

20:06.074 --> 20:08.598
Better call the morgue.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.778
Charlene, do you see him?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.780
Not yet. What's going on?

20:16.824 --> 20:18.652
Wait, look.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.001
I don't know what you're after,

20:20.044 --> 20:22.656
but this isn't helping
your kid, okay?

20:22.699 --> 20:24.048
Look, you hear me?

20:24.092 --> 20:25.136
I said this isn't helping.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.573
She died.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.228
She died.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.929
Charlene, what's happening?

20:34.972 --> 20:36.496
I'm looking.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.019
Come on, Charlene.
Give me something.

20:38.062 --> 20:39.716
Uh, yeah.
Excuse me, excuse me.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.680
Oh, god, Rick.

20:46.723 --> 20:47.898
Oh, god.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.204
No.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.598
He's... He's dead, Rick.
He's dead!

20:52.903 --> 20:54.818
He's dead.

20:54.862 --> 20:57.560
He's dead!

21:15.012 --> 21:16.405
Message received?

21:17.885 --> 21:19.669
You killed him?

21:19.713 --> 21:23.107
You killed him for a radio show?

21:23.151 --> 21:25.371
Five million.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.504
You're going to raise
five million dollars

21:28.548 --> 21:30.419
before you fall asleep.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.901
Not 20,000.

21:33.944 --> 21:36.338
Not a hundred thousand.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.427
Five million dollars,

21:38.471 --> 21:40.081
or you're next.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.866
You're insane.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.521
Five million dollars
before you sleep.

21:47.218 --> 21:49.220
Or you will never...

21:49.786 --> 21:51.005
wake up.

21:53.703 --> 21:54.704
Wait.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.620
Wait, that's impossible.

21:57.664 --> 21:59.274
It, it can't be done.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.815
Look, Rick, you can't...

22:18.859 --> 22:21.470
You can't stay awake
until we raise five million...

22:21.514 --> 22:22.602
Five million.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.386
What am I gonna do, huh?

22:24.430 --> 22:25.798
If I fall asleep,
he's gonna kill me.

22:25.822 --> 22:26.997
I have to break the record.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.912
Okay, okay.
Say that you do break it...

22:28.956 --> 22:30.412
...there's no guarantee

22:30.436 --> 22:32.263
you're gonna raise

22:32.307 --> 22:35.179
I mean, it's not even possible
to go 11 days.

22:35.223 --> 22:36.746
No? Tell her, Falco. Tell her.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.140
But if you could
get past 11 days

22:39.183 --> 22:40.620
and break the record,

22:40.663 --> 22:44.014
the research data alone
would be invaluable.

22:44.058 --> 22:45.581
Research data. Great.

So...

25:58.252 --> 26:00.733
What do I call you?

26:00.776 --> 26:02.822
We started this
with a quote

26:02.865 --> 26:04.301
from Robert Browning.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.390
Leave it at that.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.873
Okay. Okay, Browning.

26:12.875 --> 26:13.920
Browning.

26:15.312 --> 26:16.836
Do you think Dr. Gray
was wondering,

26:16.879 --> 26:18.272
"What's a heaven for?"

26:18.315 --> 26:20.796
Gray was a selfish
little sponge

26:20.840 --> 26:23.407
soaking up perks
from the drug companies.

26:24.713 --> 26:27.281
I have bigger plans
for you, Rick.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.326
You want me to be real
for my audience, huh?

26:30.284 --> 26:33.113
Why don't you be real with them?

26:33.156 --> 26:35.898
Come on the show,
and, uh, tell us your story.

26:35.942 --> 26:39.032
Inspire us with your dedication
that killed doctors

26:39.075 --> 26:40.773
to make them find a cure faster

26:40.816 --> 26:42.992
or whatever the hell it is
you're doing.

26:48.824 --> 26:52.872
Um, your, your daughter died,
and...

26:52.915 --> 26:54.743
and now you wanna help others.

26:54.787 --> 26:57.659
I, I get that, but...

26:57.703 --> 27:00.575
Rick. Rick! You're on!

27:00.619 --> 27:02.403
Rick, you're on.

All right,
this is The Rick Weider Show,

27:08.757 --> 27:12.413
and we're rocking
to find a cure for SMA,

27:12.456 --> 27:14.241
and, uh, and to stay awake.

27:19.420 --> 27:20.856
Are you okay?

27:25.731 --> 27:28.342
I've been trying to get you
for two days.

27:29.430 --> 27:30.997
Detective Murdoch.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.564
Your killer
just threatened me again.

27:33.608 --> 27:37.830
To, to murder me if, if I don't
raise millions before I sleep.

27:37.873 --> 27:39.353
A murderer? Oh.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.704
That's a great hook.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.750
Grab your audience,
reel 'em in.

27:44.793 --> 27:45.968
Hey, hey, hey.

27:47.187 --> 27:50.103
Do I look
like I'm making this up?

27:51.452 --> 27:53.193
Why would someone
wanna kill the doctor?

27:53.236 --> 27:55.325
I don't know.
How the hell should I know?

27:55.369 --> 27:57.066
Um, maybe, maybe, uh...

27:57.110 --> 27:59.634
Maybe he knew too much.

28:00.809 --> 28:01.810
About what?

28:02.811 --> 28:04.160
About him.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.858
Him, the files.
Files or something.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.598
Files, files that...

28:07.642 --> 28:09.644
can link him
to the first murder,

28:09.688 --> 28:11.254
and so, he kills him.

28:11.298 --> 28:12.603
With a poisoned syringe?

28:14.780 --> 28:16.477
The first doctor
had his intestines

28:16.520 --> 28:17.913
hanging over the East River.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.569
That's an entirely different MO.

28:21.612 --> 28:24.267
So what?

28:24.311 --> 28:26.748
How many phone calls
did you receive from this, um,

28:26.792 --> 28:27.836
supposed killer?

28:28.489 --> 28:30.012
Um...

28:30.056 --> 28:31.163
I don't know, three?

28:31.187 --> 28:32.275
No. No, four.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.234
When was the first call?

28:34.277 --> 28:37.324
About, uh... About a week ago.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.848
When did he reveal to you
that he killed the first doctor?

28:40.675 --> 28:42.024
The first call...

28:42.068 --> 28:44.331
So you knew days ahead
of this, this Wake-A-Thon

28:44.374 --> 28:46.463
that this guy was the killer.

28:46.507 --> 28:47.963
I might have tried
to reel him in myself,

28:47.987 --> 28:49.510
and that was stupid.

28:49.553 --> 28:51.164
Stupid.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.906
And now he's...
He's killed Gray,

28:53.949 --> 28:55.734
and he's set on killing me.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.954
That is not a hoax.

28:58.998 --> 29:00.651
So you've gotta do something.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.437
Police work isn't done
in front of your microphone.

29:04.699 --> 29:06.570
For the last two days,

29:06.614 --> 29:08.529
I've taken statements
from his associates,

29:08.572 --> 29:10.836
searched their offices.

29:10.879 --> 29:13.664
I even had an autopsy done
on Dr. Gray.

29:14.665 --> 29:15.841
He died...

29:17.364 --> 29:18.974
of a heart attack.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.454
A heart attack? No.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.458
For SMA.

29:24.501 --> 29:25.546
Have a nice day.

29:36.513 --> 29:37.906
Rick?

30:08.632 --> 30:10.896
Psst. Rick.

30:10.939 --> 30:12.636
Ricky boy.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.595
Oh, Rick.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.336
From your throat...

30:16.379 --> 30:19.252
Rick. Rick.
Oh, Ricky boy.

30:19.295 --> 30:20.470
Oh, Rick.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.211
Hey.

30:22.255 --> 30:23.299
Down here.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.606
Hi, pal.

30:25.649 --> 30:28.217
Wow, you certainly
look like hell.

30:28.261 --> 30:29.716
You don't really think
you're going to break

30:29.740 --> 30:31.264
the record, do you?

30:31.307 --> 30:33.875
Eleven days.
That would be something.

30:33.919 --> 30:35.659
You're a loser, though.

30:35.703 --> 30:36.965
So, no chance.

30:37.009 --> 30:38.445
Hey, guess what?

30:38.488 --> 30:41.361
I've got a hot date
with your wife tonight.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.711
I mean, with you
being such a dud,

30:43.754 --> 30:46.627
she'll come running
into my big beautiful arms.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.368
"Mantis, love."

30:48.411 --> 30:49.562
- Stop talking to me, okay?
- Ooh.

30:49.586 --> 30:50.868
- Stop talking to me.
- She's going to...

30:50.892 --> 30:52.043
- Stop talking to me, okay?
- love it, love it.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.112
Love it!

30:53.155 --> 30:54.504
- Shut up.
- Hey.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.221
Do you see that, chap?
What's he doing out there?

30:56.245 --> 30:57.507
- What?
- Strange.

31:34.022 --> 31:35.565
Hey, this is Kathy.

31:35.589 --> 31:36.938
Leave a message.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.026
Kathy.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.116
Darling, you're...

31:43.205 --> 31:44.859
You're my bride,
and you're the...

31:44.903 --> 31:46.382
You're the most important thing

31:46.426 --> 31:47.862
in the world to me. It's...

31:52.084 --> 31:53.999
I'm not gonna let anything...

31:55.000 --> 31:56.740
come between us.

31:56.784 --> 31:59.004
I'm not, I'm not going anywhere.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.790
I'm just,
I'm just sitting here, uh...

32:04.183 --> 32:05.619
hoping that...

32:23.376 --> 32:24.377
Rick Weider.

32:25.291 --> 32:26.945
I miss her.

32:28.294 --> 32:30.557
I miss my little girl.

32:31.688 --> 32:34.126
How'd you find my cell number?

32:34.169 --> 32:35.910
It's not that hard.

32:36.824 --> 32:39.044
Smart guy, huh?

32:39.087 --> 32:41.611
You can make a murder
look like a heart attack, too.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.048
Necessity,

32:43.091 --> 32:44.701
mother of invention.

32:44.745 --> 32:47.008
You're a loser, Weider.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.314
I popped by earlier.

32:49.445 --> 32:50.838
You sounded terrible,

32:50.881 --> 32:53.275
so I figured I should check
on my investment.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.147
How old was she?

32:57.801 --> 32:59.020
I said,

32:59.064 --> 33:02.154
how old was your daughter
when she died?

33:02.197 --> 33:04.156
I don't wanna talk
about her,

33:04.199 --> 33:05.809
- circus boy.
- What was her name?

33:05.853 --> 33:07.507
None of your business!

33:07.550 --> 33:09.683
You gotta give me
something, okay?

33:09.726 --> 33:11.424
People are telling me
you're a hoax.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.227
- You know better.
- I know squat!

33:14.035 --> 33:15.689
I just, I just...

33:15.732 --> 33:17.691
I need a human face, man.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.954
She's not your poster child.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.087
What's the investment for?

33:22.130 --> 33:23.325
Who are we fighting for?

33:23.349 --> 33:25.351
Who are we fighting for?

33:25.394 --> 33:27.005
Who are we fighting for?

33:28.049 --> 33:29.311
Clarissa.

33:31.444 --> 33:32.749
Got you, you bastard.

33:32.793 --> 33:34.490
- What the hell's going on?
- Clarissa.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.144
Her name is Clarissa.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.363
Clarissa?

33:37.406 --> 33:40.105
I need to speak
to Detective Murdoch.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.367
This is an emergency.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.633
All right.

33:46.676 --> 33:49.027
What is this, this emergency
you're going on about?

33:49.070 --> 33:50.221
What? Are you having
a heart attack, too?

33:50.245 --> 33:51.464
You wanted evidence, Murdoch?

33:51.507 --> 33:53.181
Now, I got you evidence.

33:53.205 --> 33:54.293
You gotta be kidding me.

33:54.336 --> 33:56.164
Browning's daughter's name...

33:56.208 --> 33:57.905
- is Clarissa.
- Clarissa?

33:57.948 --> 34:00.081
- I think it was Cla... Clarissa.
- Clarissa.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.431
I got that out of him
while you were...

34:02.475 --> 34:04.129
looking for donuts up your ass.

34:04.172 --> 34:05.347
Is that right?

34:05.391 --> 34:08.393
So, all you gotta do is, uh...

34:08.437 --> 34:10.438
is you gotta find...

34:10.483 --> 34:13.442
...Clarissa, who died of SMA
on the list.

34:13.485 --> 34:16.097
And, uh, that'll get you
her last name.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.185
And then, and you trace it

34:17.228 --> 34:18.467
- to the killer. Simple.
- Dr. Rance

34:18.491 --> 34:20.971
and Dr. Gray's deaths
are unrelated.

34:21.014 --> 34:22.625
Deal with it.

34:22.668 --> 34:24.844
The idea that a murderer
is gonna call you

34:24.888 --> 34:25.933
and offer you evidence

34:25.976 --> 34:27.021
- is absurd.
- Listen!

34:27.065 --> 34:28.588
No, you listen!

34:28.630 --> 34:30.458
You use me again...

34:30.503 --> 34:31.938
to boost your dog and pony show,

34:33.245 --> 34:34.376
and I'll arrest you.

34:36.248 --> 34:38.380
You better take his, uh,
blood pressure again, doc.

34:46.170 --> 34:47.824
Sorry, Rick.

34:48.911 --> 34:49.956
Cops, huh?

34:51.437 --> 34:53.003
Now, now you're a doctor.

34:54.179 --> 34:55.484
Why don't you find me...

34:56.181 --> 34:57.312
Gray's list?

34:59.227 --> 35:01.838
You may as well ask me
to steal gold from Fort Knox.

35:47.841 --> 35:49.408
Clarissa!

35:49.451 --> 35:51.771
"A man's reach should always exceed his grasp."

35:53.629 --> 35:55.109
"Or what's a heaven for?"

35:56.937 --> 35:57.938
Clarissa!

35:59.461 --> 36:01.202
You need
to have a bigger vision

36:01.246 --> 36:02.464
for this, Weider.

36:02.508 --> 36:05.032
They can believe in you, Weider.

36:05.075 --> 36:07.252
They can believe in you...

36:10.516 --> 36:11.647
Why, Weider?

36:17.479 --> 36:19.133
Oh, damn it.

36:20.352 --> 36:21.396
What?

36:21.440 --> 36:23.268
She is not on the list.

36:23.311 --> 36:25.661
What list?
What are you talking about?

36:25.705 --> 36:28.925
Didn't I tell you I...
I got ahold of Gray's SMA list?

36:29.491 --> 36:31.101
What?

36:31.145 --> 36:34.061
You, you said it was Fort Knox.

36:34.104 --> 36:36.194
Turns out it wasn't so hard.

36:36.237 --> 36:37.282
Had a friend of mine...

36:37.325 --> 36:38.979
...hack it.

36:40.415 --> 36:41.590
What's on it?

36:41.634 --> 36:43.026
This...

36:43.070 --> 36:45.768
is a registry
of every single child

36:45.812 --> 36:48.641
who's died from SMA
in the last 30 years.

36:48.684 --> 36:51.209
I've scanned every single name.

36:52.427 --> 36:53.646
No Clarissa.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.387
No Clarissa?

36:56.388 --> 36:57.954
Wait. Are you tell...

36:57.998 --> 36:59.913
Are you telling me
that there's no Clarissa

36:59.956 --> 37:01.131
who died of SMA?

37:07.050 --> 37:09.183
Clarissa, Clarissa, Clarissa.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.403
Clarissa had the disease.

37:11.446 --> 37:12.752
She, she...

37:13.753 --> 37:16.190
She died tragically.

37:18.105 --> 37:20.020
Poor thing, and, uh...

37:22.718 --> 37:25.547
And, uh, and then maybe
your kids...

37:25.591 --> 37:27.288
knew her, you know,

37:27.332 --> 37:29.247
or, or the family from, uh...

37:31.727 --> 37:32.946
Uh...

37:32.989 --> 37:35.296
If, uh, you could
give us a ring,

37:35.340 --> 37:37.060
we would love to hear from you.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.301
Mm, what...

37:40.345 --> 37:42.782
What are you doing here?

37:42.825 --> 37:44.610
The marriage retreat
starts today.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.655
Remember?

37:46.699 --> 37:48.135
I've got a car outside.

37:48.178 --> 37:51.094
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marriage retreat. Okay, okay.

37:51.138 --> 37:52.313
Yeah.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.923
You look
like you need a rest.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.099
Yeah, sure.

37:57.536 --> 37:58.928
Well, but wait a minute.

37:58.972 --> 38:01.757
You want me
to walk outta here, and, uh...

38:01.801 --> 38:03.585
go to some retreat with you?

38:03.629 --> 38:04.891
But it's...

38:04.934 --> 38:06.651
Fuck, Rick. You've had
a good run here, okay?

38:06.675 --> 38:07.913
I'm sure your ratings
have improved.

38:07.937 --> 38:09.635
Now just... come with me.

38:09.678 --> 38:10.786
Do the right thing.

38:10.810 --> 38:12.004
- Come with me.
- You don't understand.

38:12.028 --> 38:13.943
If I walk,
if I walk out of here, it's...

38:13.987 --> 38:15.380
Someone is going to kill me.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.947
Okay, you know what?
I understand you're exhausted.

38:17.991 --> 38:20.210
I understand
where your paranoia is...

38:20.254 --> 38:21.908
I am not paranoid, okay?

38:21.951 --> 38:24.171
Someone is actually
going to kill me.

38:24.214 --> 38:25.694
Okay. Listen, okay?

38:25.738 --> 38:27.914
You either come with me
and you save our marriage

38:27.957 --> 38:29.045
or we're through.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.744
Why can't you just
help me for once?

38:31.787 --> 38:33.746
Help you for once?

38:33.789 --> 38:36.357
These last nine years
haven't been me helping you,

38:36.401 --> 38:38.577
me by your side, Rick?

38:38.620 --> 38:40.187
You think you'd be here
without me,

38:40.230 --> 38:42.885
and now, here I am
trying to save our marriage,

38:42.929 --> 38:44.191
and you can't.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.847
You want my help now

38:47.890 --> 38:49.805
with your precious
ratings, Rick?

38:49.849 --> 38:51.546
- Yeah, that's what I want.
- Yeah?

38:51.590 --> 38:52.741
Then how about you and me

38:52.765 --> 38:54.332
- right now?
- Mm. What?

38:56.421 --> 38:59.249
Yeah.

38:59.293 --> 39:00.705
Let's make the front page
of the news.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.818
- Oh, I can't, I can't do that.
- Yeah, you can.

39:02.862 --> 39:04.037
Hmm.

39:07.257 --> 39:08.563
- What the hell?
- Yeah?

39:09.869 --> 39:11.044
- No.
- Yeah?

39:13.263 --> 39:14.264
Come on.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.404
Mm, right.

39:27.495 --> 39:29.279
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

39:30.629 --> 39:33.632
No, I'd, I'd fall asleep
afterwards, you know?

39:33.675 --> 39:36.374
Oh, come on, baby.
Do it for your ratings!

39:38.288 --> 39:40.203
No, no. This is my show.

39:41.727 --> 39:43.032
Okay? I call the shots.

39:43.076 --> 39:45.252
This is... I do things my way.

39:46.688 --> 39:49.038
Do you understand this? Do you?

40:09.102 --> 40:10.364
Kathy.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.409
Kathy!

40:15.282 --> 40:16.370
Kathy.

40:26.989 --> 40:29.078
- We can wake...
- Wake up!

40:29.122 --> 40:31.080
- Come on, Rick.
- Wake up!

40:31.124 --> 40:33.484
I'm here. Can you even hear me, Rick?

40:34.910 --> 40:36.477
Talk to me.

40:36.521 --> 40:38.348
Please. Talk to me, Rick.

40:43.963 --> 40:45.747
It's intriguing just to...

40:45.791 --> 40:47.706
watch the human brain

40:47.749 --> 40:48.837
do its thing.

40:48.881 --> 40:50.665
Look, you've gotta
give me something.

40:51.274 --> 40:52.885
Like, uh...

40:52.928 --> 40:55.322
speed or, like, smelling salts.

40:56.018 --> 40:57.846
Cocaine. I just...

40:57.890 --> 41:00.936
I just... I need drugs.

41:00.980 --> 41:02.764
I do happen...

41:02.808 --> 41:05.637
to have an old formula. It's...

41:05.680 --> 41:08.596
not exactly FDA approved,
if you know what I mean.

41:08.640 --> 41:09.684
Yeah.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.818
Always the easy way, huh, Rick?

41:12.861 --> 41:14.472
I'm not dead yet, you tool.

41:14.515 --> 41:15.951
Dude, I'm taking your spot,

41:15.995 --> 41:17.233
so I don't know why you're doing
all this crazy stuff.

41:17.257 --> 41:18.606
I'm taking your spot.

41:18.650 --> 41:19.975
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Blah, blah.
- Yeah, it's mine.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.498
- You're not getting my slot.
- Your slot's mine.

41:21.522 --> 41:22.804
- Now come on. Calm down.
- The spot's mine, dude.

41:22.828 --> 41:24.327
- Get away!
- No, don't touch me, dude.

41:24.351 --> 41:25.633
- Get away. Get away from me.
- You're losing your mind.

41:25.657 --> 41:26.938
Get away from my booth.

41:26.962 --> 41:28.549
Get away from my booth.
Get away from my booth!

41:28.573 --> 41:30.333
- No, no, no. Calm down.
- You're scaring the children.

41:30.357 --> 41:31.637
Get away!

41:31.663 --> 41:33.795
Scaring the children.

42:10.658 --> 42:12.921
Wake up,
wake up, wake up.

42:22.627 --> 42:23.627
Hey.

42:24.542 --> 42:25.847
Rick, what's...

42:27.022 --> 42:28.154
going on?

42:29.982 --> 42:31.200
Are you okay?

42:44.387 --> 42:45.911
Stay awake, Rick.

42:47.869 --> 42:50.002
Come on, I know you can.

42:57.749 --> 42:59.402
Wake up, young man!

43:00.534 --> 43:01.970
Wake up!

43:02.014 --> 43:04.364
Wake up, young man!

44:49.512 --> 44:50.731
And you...

44:50.775 --> 44:52.820
This one's
gonna be you, Browning.

44:52.864 --> 44:53.908
I'll find you.

44:57.956 --> 44:59.305
This is you.

44:59.348 --> 45:00.915
I know this...

45:00.959 --> 45:01.611
- This one's gotta be you.
- Hello?

45:01.655 --> 45:02.830
Hello, yes.

45:02.874 --> 45:04.614
Yes, I got your, um...

45:04.658 --> 45:06.573
I got your number
from an SMA registry.

45:06.616 --> 45:08.009
And there's, uh...

45:08.053 --> 45:10.055
- There's no Clarissa on it.
- What?

45:10.098 --> 45:11.423
So maybe they changed the name.

45:11.447 --> 45:13.188
- What are you talking about?
- Huh?

45:13.232 --> 45:14.712
Is your daughter Clarissa?

45:14.755 --> 45:16.254
- What? Get lost.
- I know it's you, Browning.

45:16.278 --> 45:17.342
- Browning. Browning!
- Go to hell.

45:18.454 --> 45:20.805
Shit!

45:20.848 --> 45:22.937
Stay awake, Rick.
Stay... Stay awake.

45:28.290 --> 45:29.901
That clock's not right, is it?

45:29.944 --> 45:32.251
What do you mean?
It was... It's 135 hours.

45:32.294 --> 45:33.731
You trying to screw
with me, dude?

45:33.774 --> 45:34.838
No, why would I do that?

45:34.862 --> 45:36.211
You're changing clock times now.

45:36.255 --> 45:37.125
- No, I promise you. Why...
- You're, like, getting

45:37.169 --> 45:38.257
really helpful, Miguel.

45:38.300 --> 45:39.625
- Why would I do that?
- Thanks, dude.

45:39.649 --> 45:40.868
What's going on, man?

45:40.912 --> 45:42.150
- I'm so fucking sorry.
- Oh, you know what?

45:42.174 --> 45:44.089
- I'm fucking sorry.
- What's goin' on, man?

45:44.132 --> 45:45.133
I'm sorry.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.440
Hey, what do we have?

45:47.483 --> 45:48.789
I was talking to the preacher...

45:48.833 --> 45:51.661
He's giving stupid,
mean-spirited assistance.

45:51.705 --> 45:53.074
- What the hell?
- I don't know, Rick.

45:53.098 --> 45:54.553
- What is going on?
- What is this about?

45:54.577 --> 45:56.338
- What happened to him?
- This is unbelievable!

45:56.362 --> 45:58.103
- Rick, just...
- Dude.

45:58.146 --> 45:59.582
What's going on?

45:59.626 --> 46:01.169
- I gotta call her. Get off me!
- Who are you calling?

46:01.193 --> 46:03.040
- Who are you calling?
- You need to just calm down.

46:03.064 --> 46:04.544
Relax. Have you eaten?
Did he eat?

46:04.587 --> 46:06.546
- He drank. He, he...
- Has he eaten something?

46:06.589 --> 46:08.113
Is Kathy there?

46:08.156 --> 46:09.201
Who is he calling?

46:09.244 --> 46:10.637
If she, you know... Wait, wait.

46:10.680 --> 46:12.073
Is, um...

46:12.117 --> 46:14.162
Okay, when, when she gets back,
well, it's me again.

46:14.206 --> 46:16.556
So, when she gets back,
she can...

46:16.599 --> 46:19.037
It's okay. Never mind.
I'm gonna try again at five.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.821
- Okay? Yeah.
- Are you feeling...

46:20.865 --> 46:22.823
Are you feeling, like, anxious?

46:22.867 --> 46:24.496
What happened?
Did something happen?

46:24.520 --> 46:25.840
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

46:25.870 --> 46:27.175
You can do this.
You can do this.

46:27.219 --> 46:28.786
Yeah...

46:28.829 --> 46:30.111
- I gotta get out...
- I promise you,

46:30.135 --> 46:31.721
- I'll get you something.
- You guys like salsa?

46:31.745 --> 46:33.288
- I'm not hungry right now.
- Yeah, I love salsa.

46:33.312 --> 46:34.313
Yes.

46:35.314 --> 46:36.706
- Rick.
- Salsa.

46:36.750 --> 46:39.535
Salsa, salsa, salsa.

46:39.579 --> 46:40.948
- Salsa.
- Do you know what time it is?

46:40.972 --> 46:42.625
Salsa!

48:08.320 --> 48:09.408
- He's here.
- What?

48:09.451 --> 48:11.105
- Browning.
- What?

48:11.149 --> 48:12.585
- Do you see him?
- I can't hear

48:12.628 --> 48:14.215
- what you're saying. He's not...
- He's here! Browning!

48:14.239 --> 48:15.879
- It's Browning!
- Rick, come back!

48:17.459 --> 48:18.460
Rick!

48:22.856 --> 48:25.772
Ooh! Ooh!

48:27.426 --> 48:30.516
Oh, man, Rick.
That was... That was awesome.

48:32.257 --> 48:34.912
We are in the footsteps
of Edison.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.175
Thomas Edison. He...

48:38.176 --> 48:40.178
He fought to eradicate sleep.

48:40.221 --> 48:43.007
He was a raging, driven man.

48:44.095 --> 48:45.531
Didn't win,

48:45.574 --> 48:46.880
but he contributed.

48:48.838 --> 48:52.059
Gave us the electric light bulb

48:52.103 --> 48:55.541
to find our way
through the darkness.

48:55.584 --> 48:57.847
Man, do you even have a license?

48:57.891 --> 48:59.849
For whatever it is
that you do?

49:01.112 --> 49:03.070
Over to you, Miguel.

49:03.114 --> 49:04.724
Call me if you need me.

49:04.767 --> 49:06.465
Goodnight,
sweet prince.

49:08.206 --> 49:09.886
It was Tesla, by the way.

49:14.429 --> 49:16.431
That's strange.

49:16.475 --> 49:18.129
Isn't that the exact
same amount of money

49:18.172 --> 49:19.304
we had four hours ago?

49:22.002 --> 49:23.612
What? What are you
talking about?

49:25.440 --> 49:27.268
No, I'm just saying
that it's kinda weird

49:27.312 --> 49:30.402
that not a single person
has given us a dollar since.

49:39.802 --> 49:41.345
Should I wake her up?

49:41.369 --> 49:43.173
It's gotta wake her up, or I'm
gonna try to do it myself.

49:43.197 --> 49:44.633
Just like last summer.

49:44.677 --> 49:46.157
I need her help.

49:46.200 --> 49:48.202
- Hello?
- Uh, yeah, Charlene.

49:48.246 --> 49:50.291
- Um...
- Is everything okay?

49:50.335 --> 49:54.513
Yeah. Something's gone, uh,
wonky with the board.

49:54.556 --> 49:56.317
- Oh, my god.
- I need you to, um...

49:56.341 --> 49:58.647
to check the total
at the source.

49:58.691 --> 50:00.388
Check the total at the source.

50:00.432 --> 50:02.390
Okay, hang on.

50:04.349 --> 50:05.741
Log in.

50:11.095 --> 50:13.184
Okay.

50:13.227 --> 50:14.837
Uh...

50:14.881 --> 50:16.883
Monitor's... all right.

50:16.926 --> 50:18.102
Oh, boy.

50:18.145 --> 50:19.668
Charlene, are you there?

50:19.712 --> 50:21.235
Oh, my god.

50:21.279 --> 50:23.237
- Oh, my god.
- What?

50:23.281 --> 50:24.760
What's going on?

50:24.804 --> 50:26.719
It's gone.

50:26.762 --> 50:28.262
What? What's gone?

50:28.286 --> 50:30.177
- It's all gone.
- What's all gone?

50:30.201 --> 50:31.637
The money!

50:31.680 --> 50:33.639
The... The, uh, account.

50:33.682 --> 50:36.511
The... The pledges are,
uh, empty.

50:37.295 --> 50:38.296
Zero.

50:39.297 --> 50:40.733
What the hell is happening?

50:47.479 --> 50:49.002
I saw you.

50:49.046 --> 50:50.482
You're out there.

50:50.525 --> 50:52.112
So, what
are you gonna tell your wife

50:52.136 --> 50:54.355
about that coed
you were dancing with?

50:55.182 --> 50:56.792
You're a good liar.

50:56.836 --> 50:58.664
No, you're the liar, Browning.

50:58.707 --> 51:01.406
No Clarissa died from SMA
in the past 30 years.

51:01.449 --> 51:03.625
Do you...
Do you even have a daughter?

51:03.669 --> 51:04.757
Huh?

51:04.800 --> 51:06.019
Just put her on the phone.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.542
Are you finished?

51:07.586 --> 51:09.109
Hey, listen.

51:09.153 --> 51:12.460
Listen, about this, uh,
arbitrary five million, uh.

51:12.504 --> 51:15.028
Let's, uh... Let's make it
half a million.

51:15.072 --> 51:16.421
Still a lot of money, huh?

51:16.464 --> 51:19.337
You're in no position to negotiate.

51:24.864 --> 51:26.474
Shit.

52:03.076 --> 52:04.077
Rick.

52:08.386 --> 52:09.474
I'm dead.

52:12.346 --> 52:14.479
There's no way
I can raise this money now.

52:14.522 --> 52:16.829
Rick, the money's been stolen.

52:16.872 --> 52:18.526
We have to call the police.

52:18.570 --> 52:20.049
No.

52:20.093 --> 52:21.573
No, the word will get out.

52:25.316 --> 52:26.969
Whoever took the money

52:27.013 --> 52:29.407
had to be someone
who could get in.

52:29.450 --> 52:30.495
Like who?

52:33.933 --> 52:36.457
What if Browning took the money?

52:36.501 --> 52:39.808
No, no. Browning wouldn't,
wouldn't screw over SMA.

52:39.852 --> 52:41.288
No, hear me out.

52:41.332 --> 52:43.595
There is no Clarissa.

52:43.638 --> 52:46.075
Dr. Gray, he died
of a heart attack.

52:46.946 --> 52:48.774
This guy isn't a murderer.

52:48.817 --> 52:50.428
He's an opportunist.

52:50.471 --> 52:52.101
He was just looking for
the biggest pot of money

52:52.125 --> 52:53.170
he could find.

52:53.213 --> 52:54.432
No, no, no.

52:54.475 --> 52:56.782
Browning didn't, didn't know
about the money.

52:56.825 --> 52:59.219
On the phone, he...

52:59.263 --> 53:01.395
He didn't know
what I was talking about.

53:03.223 --> 53:04.572
Someone else.

53:06.531 --> 53:08.228
If we can't find the money,

53:08.272 --> 53:09.273
it's...

53:14.582 --> 53:15.670
I'm dead.

53:22.111 --> 53:24.002
Breathe. Look, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

53:24.026 --> 53:25.550
Just breathe. Relax.

53:25.593 --> 53:27.029
Relax. Rick, Rick.

53:27.073 --> 53:28.683
- Shut up!
- Rick, listen to me, man.

53:28.727 --> 53:30.772
You're not well, huh?

53:30.816 --> 53:31.967
Let's get you
to the medical room,

53:31.991 --> 53:33.210
we'll run some tests.

53:33.253 --> 53:36.648
No, I'm not leaving.
No, no, he's out there!

53:36.691 --> 53:38.302
I can't leave.
I can't cross that street.

53:38.345 --> 53:39.781
He's out there!

53:39.825 --> 53:41.305
Okay, yeah, I need that stuff.

53:41.348 --> 53:42.717
We got that stronger stuff
that you were talking about?

53:42.741 --> 53:44.873
I need it now. Now!
Get it, get it. Get it. Now.

53:47.311 --> 53:49.182
Come with me
and you save our marriage,

53:49.226 --> 53:50.966
or we're through!

53:51.010 --> 53:53.142
We're through!

53:53.186 --> 53:54.468
They're not
the problem.

53:54.492 --> 53:56.450
You are.

53:56.494 --> 53:58.800
You are.

53:58.844 --> 54:00.387
- What ya lookin' at?
- They're not the problem.

54:00.411 --> 54:01.518
- We're through!
- You are.

54:04.545 --> 54:05.938
Clarissa.

54:05.981 --> 54:08.070
We're through!

54:08.114 --> 54:09.483
- Clarissa.
- You are.

54:09.507 --> 54:10.725
Larabee.

54:10.769 --> 54:12.336
They're not
the problem.

54:12.379 --> 54:14.096
- Clarissa.
- You are. You are.

54:14.120 --> 54:17.166
- You are. You are.
- Top down. Top down.

54:17.210 --> 54:18.646
Rick.

54:18.690 --> 54:19.691
Top down.

54:23.042 --> 54:24.173
Larabee.

54:25.827 --> 54:27.916
Holy shit. He took it.

54:27.960 --> 54:29.091
He took the money.

54:29.918 --> 54:31.703
Larabee took it.

54:35.184 --> 54:36.273
This should do the trick.

54:47.371 --> 54:48.763
This should do the trick.

54:48.807 --> 54:51.331
You be, uh, careful though.
This is potent stuff.

55:24.712 --> 55:25.757
Rick?

55:25.800 --> 55:27.236
- Teresa, Teresa.
- Hi.

55:27.280 --> 55:28.388
Come here.
Come here, Teresa.

55:28.412 --> 55:29.456
- Yup.
- Come here.

55:30.631 --> 55:32.241
- Hi.
- Yeah, hey.

55:32.285 --> 55:33.939
- You... You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

55:33.982 --> 55:35.157
Never been better.

55:35.201 --> 55:36.526
Good. It's really great
what you're doing.

55:36.550 --> 55:37.788
It's really great
that you're here.

55:37.812 --> 55:39.224
- Yeah, um...
- I like you. I like you, Teresa.

55:39.248 --> 55:40.617
You're a good girl.
I like good girls.

55:40.641 --> 55:41.729
Thanks. Thank you.

55:41.773 --> 55:43.818
Um, Charlene, she...
Charlene, um,

55:43.862 --> 55:46.343
she said if you can't, um,
leave the booth

55:46.386 --> 55:48.495
to take a shower, you should,
should have these baby wipes.

55:48.519 --> 55:49.607
Oh, thank you.

55:49.650 --> 55:50.825
- Charlene said that?
- Yeah.

55:50.869 --> 55:52.237
So, I'm gonna do
what Charlene says, right?

55:52.261 --> 55:53.480
- Um...
- You like Charlene?

55:53.524 --> 55:54.612
Uh, yeah, sure.

55:54.655 --> 55:56.396
Really?

55:56.440 --> 55:58.485
- Yeah. Okay. You like, like her?
- Yeah.

55:58.529 --> 55:59.530
Mm-hm.

56:02.489 --> 56:04.230
Thank you. Happy now?

56:04.273 --> 56:06.034
- Um, she's...
- Happy? Happy now? Go. Go, go.

56:06.058 --> 56:07.122
- Oh, yeah.
- Tell Charlene I did it.

56:12.456 --> 56:13.805
Rick Weider.

56:13.848 --> 56:15.023
Yeah. Hi, Rick.

56:15.067 --> 56:17.635
Uh, Roy Angstrom
from The Daily News.

56:17.678 --> 56:19.593
I have it
from a confidential source

56:19.637 --> 56:21.484
that the money you're raising
in the Wake-A-Thon

56:21.508 --> 56:23.728
has gone missing.

56:23.771 --> 56:26.861
Would, uh...
Would you care to comment?

56:27.471 --> 56:28.689
Uh, what?

56:29.560 --> 56:31.257
Uh...

56:31.300 --> 56:32.606
Uh, who, who told you that?

56:32.650 --> 56:34.086
It's, uh...

56:34.129 --> 56:35.392
It's, uh...

56:35.435 --> 56:37.394
Rick, you sound upset.

56:37.437 --> 56:38.699
Are you confirming?

56:38.743 --> 56:40.701
Uh, no, I got it. I got it.

56:40.745 --> 56:43.051
I... I mean,
I got it under control.

56:43.095 --> 56:44.923
All right? It's, uh...

56:44.966 --> 56:46.403
Huh?

56:46.446 --> 56:47.554
So, the money
for the dying kids,

56:47.578 --> 56:48.883
it's, it's all there, right?

56:48.927 --> 56:50.189
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yes.

56:50.232 --> 56:52.452
I mean, yeah. Yeah.

56:52.496 --> 56:54.585
You sound
very nervous, Rick.

56:54.628 --> 56:56.848
You sure you're telling
the truth?

56:56.891 --> 56:59.633
You okay with us looking
at your financial statements?

57:01.200 --> 57:02.593
Uh...

57:14.953 --> 57:16.650
Rick, Rick, Rick.

57:16.694 --> 57:18.435
Rick, Rick.

57:18.870 --> 57:20.698
Oh, my.

57:22.177 --> 57:24.876
Look at you, my boy.

57:24.919 --> 57:27.487
What a mess you're in!

57:27.531 --> 57:29.881
It's all your fault, you know?

57:29.924 --> 57:31.404
Your lack of talent.

57:31.448 --> 57:33.101
Your worthlessness.

57:33.145 --> 57:35.234
- Worthlessness.
- No.

57:35.277 --> 57:36.365
Oh, yes.

57:36.409 --> 57:39.673
There's no denying it.
You know that.

57:39.717 --> 57:44.330
Why don't you just give up
and be done with it?

57:44.373 --> 57:46.898
What chance do you really have?

57:47.464 --> 57:48.595
Zippo.

57:49.727 --> 57:50.858
I can do this.

57:54.340 --> 57:55.515
Can't I?

57:55.559 --> 57:58.083
No, you can't. You're a failure.

57:58.126 --> 58:00.215
No one cares.

58:00.259 --> 58:02.479
Just die already.

58:09.181 --> 58:12.140
♪ I lay my life down

58:22.063 --> 58:25.023
♪ I lay my life down

58:30.071 --> 58:33.335
♪ It's you, my love

58:33.379 --> 58:37.209
♪ It's you, my love
I can't live without ♪

58:59.448 --> 59:00.537
Good...

59:03.322 --> 59:05.672
Good morning.

59:05.716 --> 59:07.935
Morning, New York.
This is, uh...

59:09.415 --> 59:10.938
the seventh day.

59:13.245 --> 59:14.986
Seven days awake.

59:16.814 --> 59:19.773
Wide, wide awake.

59:21.645 --> 59:23.603
You know, they...

59:23.647 --> 59:27.302
They tell us
that God created the world...

59:28.652 --> 59:30.567
in six days, and then...

59:31.568 --> 59:33.352
rested on the seventh.

59:35.397 --> 59:38.836
Well, God...
God may have taken a little nap

59:38.879 --> 59:40.838
on, uh, on the seventh day,
but...

59:42.361 --> 59:45.843
not me, I'm still going.
Still...

59:46.452 --> 59:47.584
Still fighting.

59:48.497 --> 59:49.586
Still awake.

59:50.499 --> 59:52.371
I can't rest.

59:52.414 --> 59:55.113
I can't rest, won't rest.
I can't rest, won't rest till...

59:56.636 --> 59:58.899
Until we get those
five million...

59:59.770 --> 01:00:00.814
dollars.

01:00:02.642 --> 01:00:04.644
Thousands of children,

01:00:06.254 --> 01:00:08.692
dying children
are waiting for...

01:00:09.823 --> 01:00:13.871
for your help before they die.

01:00:13.914 --> 01:00:18.310
And then, the parents are left
to cry their eyes out...

01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:20.965
until they die.

01:00:28.102 --> 01:00:29.234
The worst...

01:00:30.104 --> 01:00:31.192
part...

01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:35.153
about having

01:00:35.196 --> 01:00:39.157
to stay awake day after day

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.639
after day, after day,
after day...

01:00:46.294 --> 01:00:47.905
is having to have to spend

01:00:48.906 --> 01:00:51.996
every waking...

01:00:52.823 --> 01:00:54.651
waking minute

01:00:55.782 --> 01:00:56.870
with your...

01:00:58.176 --> 01:00:59.917
horrible self.

01:01:03.572 --> 01:01:07.664
You've got to face
everything rotten,

01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:09.796
sordid,

01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:13.408
every miserable thing

01:01:13.452 --> 01:01:14.540
wrong with you.

01:01:17.586 --> 01:01:21.416
And just when you've
had enough, and you can't...

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.245
you can't stand
the wretched sight anymore,

01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:27.422
you just... you just wanna
put your head down

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.251
and fall asleep, and...

01:01:32.297 --> 01:01:34.125
dream, just dream.

01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:38.564
Dream about
all the little things

01:01:38.607 --> 01:01:40.261
that make you happy.

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:44.613
But you've gotta
stay awake

01:01:44.657 --> 01:01:46.615
until you've got
five million dollars.

01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:48.182
Come on, buddy, you can do it!

01:01:52.447 --> 01:01:54.928
I'll rest when we get
the five million.

01:01:55.886 --> 01:01:57.714
So, give it to me, New York.

01:01:59.585 --> 01:02:00.804
So I can dream again.

01:02:11.902 --> 01:02:13.251
Rick.

01:02:13.294 --> 01:02:14.794
Uh, I, I... I've been trying
to reach you, Kath.

01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:16.080
Honey, so...

01:02:16.123 --> 01:02:17.211
so much is going on,

01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:18.735
and I can't trust anybody
but you.

01:02:19.431 --> 01:02:20.432
Rick.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.957
I can't.

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:25.263
Honey, I need you,

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:27.004
to, to help me
fight this through.

01:02:27.047 --> 01:02:28.353
Yeah.

01:02:28.396 --> 01:02:30.050
But they're not listening to me.

01:02:30.094 --> 01:02:32.052
No matter what I do,

01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:33.619
they just still don't listen.

01:02:35.055 --> 01:02:37.579
I saw a divorce lawyer
this morning.

01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:40.931
What?

01:02:40.974 --> 01:02:43.020
When I heard you
on the radio,

01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:45.283
I always thought
that you just loved yourself

01:02:45.326 --> 01:02:46.545
more than anything.

01:02:47.807 --> 01:02:49.156
But that's not true, is it?

01:02:51.028 --> 01:02:52.420
You hate yourself.

01:02:52.464 --> 01:02:53.987
And you always have.

01:02:57.121 --> 01:02:59.863
And if you can't love you, then,

01:02:59.906 --> 01:03:02.735
well, you're sure as hell never
gonna be able to love me.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:05.694
Don't.

01:03:08.872 --> 01:03:10.308
I want a divorce.

01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:31.982
Whoa!

01:03:32.025 --> 01:03:33.810
Good, this is radio.

01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:35.463
It stinks in here!

01:03:35.507 --> 01:03:37.465
- Get out.
- You okay?

01:03:37.509 --> 01:03:38.727
Get out.

01:03:38.771 --> 01:03:40.077
- You okay?
- Get out.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.774
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey!
- Get out.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.143
- I'm out of here.
- Get out!

01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:44.407
I'm going, I'm going!

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.615
Help me.

01:04:53.324 --> 01:04:54.629
You can do this, Rick.

01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:57.067
You can do this.

01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:58.155
You're doing it, Rick.

01:04:58.198 --> 01:04:59.765
You're doing a great job.

01:04:59.808 --> 01:05:02.288
You're gonna stay awake. You're gonna break the record.

01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:04.030
Keep going.

01:05:09.079 --> 01:05:12.299
Wake up, sleepyhead.
I believe in you, sweetheart.

01:05:14.258 --> 01:05:15.650
Good job, darling.

01:05:15.694 --> 01:05:16.695
Keep it up.

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:20.873
You are the best, Rick.

01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:26.400
You are a radio god.

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:30.665
You are a radio god.

01:05:33.538 --> 01:05:35.366
You are a radio god.

01:05:36.236 --> 01:05:38.282
You are a radio god.

01:05:39.718 --> 01:05:41.633
You are a radio god.

01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:44.070
Rick.

01:05:47.726 --> 01:05:49.815
You are a radio god.

01:05:51.904 --> 01:05:53.993
Rick, you are a radio god.

01:05:58.911 --> 01:06:00.541
- Rick, come on!
- Stay awake. Come on.

01:06:00.565 --> 01:06:02.021
- You're on the air. We're live!
- Stay awake. Stay awake.

01:06:02.045 --> 01:06:03.370
- Stay awake.
- You got this.

01:06:03.394 --> 01:06:04.308
- Come on, get up!
- You can do this.

01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:05.918
- Yes! Yes!
- Come on. Come on.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:06.658
- You can do this.
- Oh, my god. Come on, come on.

01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:08.225
- Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes!

01:06:08.268 --> 01:06:09.704
Put it back.

01:06:09.748 --> 01:06:11.184
WZLW, Rick Weider.

01:06:11.228 --> 01:06:12.335
- We are back.
- Yep.

01:06:12.359 --> 01:06:15.058
Against, uh, against all odds,

01:06:15.101 --> 01:06:17.364
for the cause
of the eradication of SMA.

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:18.472
- Mm-hm.
- Good job.

01:06:18.496 --> 01:06:19.758
I'm still awake.

01:06:19.801 --> 01:06:22.021
This is day...
Hey, hey, what day is it?

01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:23.109
Day eight.

01:06:23.153 --> 01:06:24.347
- Eight?
- It's eight.

01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:27.200
Holy... how'd we do that?

01:06:27.244 --> 01:06:29.246
What do these kids with SMA do?

01:06:29.289 --> 01:06:31.378
Or their parents?

01:06:31.422 --> 01:06:33.008
- They're counting on you.
- We've got to prevail.

01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:34.468
- The rage...
- Yes.

01:06:34.512 --> 01:06:36.383
against the dying of the light!

01:06:36.427 --> 01:06:37.471
- Yes!
- Yeah!

01:06:37.515 --> 01:06:39.343
- We must prevail!
- Yes!

01:06:39.386 --> 01:06:42.302
- So, send your money in.
- Mm-hm.

01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:46.132
And, uh, let's just give
these kids a fighting chance.

01:06:46.176 --> 01:06:48.874
Do it. Do it. Do it
while, while there's still time.

01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:50.658
Mm-hm.

01:06:50.702 --> 01:06:51.920
Do it.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.447
Yes.

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:57.665
Great job, buddy.

01:06:57.709 --> 01:06:59.450
You're back.

01:06:59.493 --> 01:07:00.842
Oh! Oh!

01:07:00.886 --> 01:07:02.975
- Okay.
- You're gonna be fine.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.846
You got it.

01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:07.545
Hey, I just got a call
from POSMA.

01:07:07.588 --> 01:07:09.677
Have you been making
obscene phone calls?

01:07:09.721 --> 01:07:11.636
- POSMA?
- People of SMA.

01:07:11.679 --> 01:07:13.377
It's a support group
for parents.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.943
They're complaining
that somebody

01:07:14.987 --> 01:07:16.356
is calling them
in the middle of the night,

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.817
asking if their kids
are still dead.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.515
You know, Browning's
one of them. I know it.

01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:22.908
Look, Rick.

01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:24.779
These people have lost a lot.

01:07:24.823 --> 01:07:26.955
You have got to be
sensitive to that.

01:07:26.999 --> 01:07:29.480
Why is that? Why isn't Clarissa
on this list?

01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:31.917
He told me she died.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.745
She should be on it.

01:07:33.788 --> 01:07:34.876
Well, maybe she...

01:07:35.616 --> 01:07:37.053
died of something else.

01:07:46.671 --> 01:07:49.108
- Sign up here. Help find a cure.
- SMA pledge.

01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:50.196
Come here.

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:53.547
Hey, you know,
I was thinking, um...

01:07:53.591 --> 01:07:55.941
You know, I heard
about this place downtown.

01:07:55.984 --> 01:07:57.334
- Yeah.
- Uh...

01:07:57.377 --> 01:07:59.727
It's a cool, like, dinner,
like underground vibe.

01:07:59.771 --> 01:08:00.878
They have, like, jazz bands.

01:08:00.902 --> 01:08:02.165
And I was thinking, you know,

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:03.620
maybe if you're not doing
anything later...

01:08:03.644 --> 01:08:05.864
Um...

01:08:05.907 --> 01:08:09.172
No. I... I have a lot
of work to do, actually.

01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:10.738
I have a midterm on Monday,

01:08:10.782 --> 01:08:12.131
- and...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:12.175 --> 01:08:14.699
Um, maybe some other time?

01:08:14.742 --> 01:08:15.917
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

01:08:15.961 --> 01:08:17.093
Pledges!

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:23.795
And we're back with Nancy Turner

01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:26.624
who, uh...

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:29.540
tragically lost
a daughter to SMA.

01:08:29.582 --> 01:08:34.109
So, um, tell us...
tell us, Nancy, about, um...

01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:35.459
about the final days.

01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:41.073
Megan, she could...

01:08:44.468 --> 01:08:46.122
she, um...

01:08:46.165 --> 01:08:47.514
she couldn't do anything.

01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:52.563
The process was long
and difficult for all of us.

01:08:54.216 --> 01:08:56.871
She was so, so brave.

01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:01.832
Yeah.

01:09:01.876 --> 01:09:04.270
Ooh, that must have been
real hard.

01:09:05.662 --> 01:09:07.621
Well, she died in her sleep.

01:09:07.665 --> 01:09:09.014
I was glad for that.

01:09:10.102 --> 01:09:12.191
I'd kill to die in my sleep.

01:09:12.234 --> 01:09:14.323
Oh, my.

01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:16.368
You have had a time of it.

01:09:16.412 --> 01:09:18.197
I should have brought you
some soup.

01:09:19.502 --> 01:09:20.546
Soup?

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:23.710
I mean, you want me
to drown or something?

01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:26.747
I know that we gotta...
we gotta think

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:27.946
of these things going in.

01:09:27.988 --> 01:09:29.381
It's like having children.

01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:30.688
You know, there's a risk there.

01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:32.777
A risk worth taking.

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:34.474
Yeah, that's what they say,
you know.

01:09:34.518 --> 01:09:38.304
What, uh, whatever comes,
you accept the responsibility.

01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:40.479
Life is in God's hands.

01:09:40.524 --> 01:09:44.658
God? God isn't raising money
for SMA research. I am.

01:09:44.702 --> 01:09:46.182
God... God isn't...

01:09:46.225 --> 01:09:49.185
didn't ultimately help
your kid from dying.

01:09:49.228 --> 01:09:50.249
Let's face it.

01:09:50.273 --> 01:09:52.536
When push came to shove,

01:09:52.578 --> 01:09:54.625
you... you didn't take her
to... to a healer,

01:09:54.668 --> 01:09:55.887
you took her to a doctor.

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:58.063
She... She's in heaven now.

01:09:58.106 --> 01:09:59.499
And, uh... So tell me, tell me.

01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:02.023
Did you, uh, did you donate
the kid's brains?

01:10:02.067 --> 01:10:03.242
What?

01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:05.026
Or did you just store her
in the ground

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:06.593
where she's no use to anybody?

01:10:06.637 --> 01:10:08.639
How dare you?

01:10:11.903 --> 01:10:13.272
- Please, I am so sorry.
- No.

01:10:13.296 --> 01:10:14.688
I, I didn't...

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.737
Well, that went better
than expected, didn't it?

01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:22.368
- Charlene!
- I don't care how tired you are,

01:10:22.392 --> 01:10:24.698
- you self-serving monster!
- Wait a minute.

01:10:24.742 --> 01:10:26.285
Wait, wait. Charlene, okay.
It's... It's not his fault.

01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:27.875
Okay? He's just tired.

01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:28.983
- He's really, really tired.
- Yeah, I'm just really tired.

01:10:29.007 --> 01:10:30.661
- Yeah, he's tired.
- He's really tired!

01:10:30.704 --> 01:10:31.986
He's really tired.

01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:34.447
- It's okay. Oh!
- I'm tired.

01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:36.057
Yeah, it's okay.

01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:37.233
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, please!

01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:38.321
Oh, my god.

01:10:38.364 --> 01:10:40.888
I've had it!

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.241
It's okay.

01:10:45.937 --> 01:10:46.981
Great.

01:10:47.025 --> 01:10:48.635
Yeah, yeah. It's okay.

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.599
Just go, go get coffee.

01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:57.470
Yeah.

01:10:57.514 --> 01:10:59.733
Abusing a guest?

01:10:59.777 --> 01:11:01.909
Get control of yourself.

01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:03.694
The lady,

01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:05.261
she lost a child, too.

01:11:06.436 --> 01:11:08.568
But she isn't here
threatening me.

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:11.832
I won't be a martyr for you.

01:11:12.485 --> 01:11:13.660
For SMA.

01:11:15.227 --> 01:11:16.881
Or for anyone else.

01:11:16.924 --> 01:11:18.404
Oh, you might.

01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:21.799
The DJ dies for SMA research.

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:24.671
And five million will be
a drop in the bucket.

01:11:24.715 --> 01:11:27.761
And I win, and you'll be damned.

01:11:27.805 --> 01:11:30.547
No. Damn you.

01:11:31.852 --> 01:11:32.940
Damn you.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:38.468
This... whole thing's
cost me my marriage,

01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:39.947
my job.

01:11:40.905 --> 01:11:42.167
I have nothing.

01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:43.560
You?

01:11:43.603 --> 01:11:46.040
I lost everything!

01:11:46.084 --> 01:11:50.349
My wife left me
when my Clarissa died.

01:11:50.393 --> 01:11:52.612
I... I cared for her.

01:11:52.656 --> 01:11:54.179
More than my own health!

01:11:54.222 --> 01:11:58.618
I, I trudged through the snow
with her in my arms,

01:11:58.662 --> 01:12:00.359
to get her
to the emergency room,

01:12:00.403 --> 01:12:02.840
because 911 wasn't responding!

01:12:02.883 --> 01:12:04.798
Those five million bucks
won't...

01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:07.235
won't settle your grief.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.288
Come on, come on.

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:31.956
What the hell?

01:13:04.162 --> 01:13:05.337
Psst, hey.

01:13:06.251 --> 01:13:08.166
Yes, I'm back.

01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:10.124
Listen. Listen carefully.

01:13:11.082 --> 01:13:12.431
Look at her.

01:13:12.475 --> 01:13:14.738
Look at that slut.

01:13:14.781 --> 01:13:17.480
She cooked up
this plot against you.

01:13:17.523 --> 01:13:20.526
It's her and Larabee.
They're in this together.

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:21.770
Did you ever think about that?

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:23.790
That moron Larabee,

01:13:23.834 --> 01:13:25.096
he's out to get you.

01:13:25.139 --> 01:13:28.142
He's gonna take your job away.

01:13:28.186 --> 01:13:31.363
It's really her that set
this whole thing up.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:34.627
Ooh, wouldn't you just like
to put your hands

01:13:34.671 --> 01:13:37.456
around her throat
and crush that windpipe of hers?

01:13:38.152 --> 01:13:41.286
Oh, yes.

01:13:44.768 --> 01:13:45.812
Look, Rick.

01:13:47.248 --> 01:13:49.686
I'm sorry about yesterday.

01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:52.123
I guess I'm pretty tired myself.

01:13:55.648 --> 01:13:57.258
You found your comfort,
haven't you?

01:13:58.216 --> 01:13:59.913
Oh, you disgust me!

01:14:01.349 --> 01:14:03.700
You need to up your dosage.

01:14:03.743 --> 01:14:05.310
I saw you kissing him.

01:14:07.094 --> 01:14:08.792
You're on his side,
aren't you?

01:14:09.575 --> 01:14:12.448
Why... Why him?

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:17.017
You think you're the only one
whose job is on the line?

01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:23.763
Oh, Charlene.

01:14:23.807 --> 01:14:26.287
I begged him not to fire you!

01:14:26.331 --> 01:14:28.464
But he doesn't seem to have
a problem with you now.

01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:30.770
He thinks you'll actually
break the record.

01:14:30.814 --> 01:14:32.293
He doesn't have a problem now?

01:14:33.643 --> 01:14:34.881
That's 'cause he's got
the money.

01:14:34.905 --> 01:14:36.733
Don't make any more trouble
for yourself.

01:14:36.776 --> 01:14:40.084
Your new boyfriend Larabee
is a sharp customer.

01:14:40.127 --> 01:14:41.564
Just get him over here tonight.

01:14:41.607 --> 01:14:45.959
I... I'm gonna trip him up
in a subtle way that he...

01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:47.221
he can't see coming.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:48.919
Huh?

01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:51.269
Give me the money, you prick.

01:14:51.312 --> 01:14:52.551
Give it to me or I'll kill you!

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:54.664
Get off me, you maniac!

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.191
- You won't get away with it.
- What money?

01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:01.627
I'll take you down.

01:15:01.671 --> 01:15:03.237
I'll make sure he gets you, too.

01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:06.806
You mean the SMA money?

01:15:07.764 --> 01:15:08.895
It's gone.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:10.854
That's it.

01:15:10.897 --> 01:15:13.291
I'm pulling the plug
on this sham. You're done.

01:15:13.334 --> 01:15:14.616
Wait. Please, please,
please, hold on.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.989
Wait, wait, look at me.

01:15:16.033 --> 01:15:17.904
Um...

01:15:17.948 --> 01:15:20.080
I need you to get me
the money back, okay?

01:15:20.124 --> 01:15:21.342
'Cause I wanna live.

01:15:21.386 --> 01:15:23.257
So, look, I'll, uh...
I'll do anything.

01:15:23.301 --> 01:15:25.477
I'll play Top 40.
See, I love these stuff.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:26.913
♪ Baby, baby, wait, wait, wait

01:15:26.957 --> 01:15:28.567
♪ Baby, melt your broken heart

01:15:28.611 --> 01:15:29.805
- ♪ Baby, I'll
- What the hell's going on

01:15:29.829 --> 01:15:31.439
- in here?
- ♪ I'll

01:15:31.483 --> 01:15:32.963
You're one pathetic bastard.

01:15:35.139 --> 01:15:36.575
You're not taking me
off the air.

01:15:37.228 --> 01:15:38.664
You do that,

01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:40.492
and everyone will find out

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:41.687
about the kickbacks
you're getting

01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:42.842
from record companies

01:15:42.886 --> 01:15:44.757
to play your precious Top 40.

01:15:50.633 --> 01:15:51.808
That's very funny.

01:15:56.464 --> 01:15:58.379
How'd you know
he's getting kickbacks?

01:15:58.423 --> 01:15:59.555
He's getting kickbacks?

01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:01.557
You just said he was!

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.341
What?

01:16:03.384 --> 01:16:05.256
Oh, yeah. I... I was bluffing.

01:16:11.523 --> 01:16:12.524
Rick.

01:16:13.046 --> 01:16:14.352
Rick.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:17.964
Rick.

01:16:19.836 --> 01:16:20.880
Rick.

01:16:21.925 --> 01:16:22.926
Rick.

01:16:24.536 --> 01:16:25.581
Rick.

01:16:26.712 --> 01:16:27.757
Rick!

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:29.585
Rick?

01:16:32.805 --> 01:16:34.807
I think the pills
are kicking in.

01:16:34.851 --> 01:16:36.809
He's technically awake, right?

01:16:36.853 --> 01:16:38.681
Technically?

01:16:38.724 --> 01:16:40.421
The machine is registering REM.

01:16:41.553 --> 01:16:43.337
It's a dream phase.

01:16:43.381 --> 01:16:45.141
- Rick.
- Look at him.

01:16:45.862 --> 01:16:48.081
Rapid eye movement.

01:16:48.125 --> 01:16:50.214
He's crossed
a very dangerous threshold.

01:16:50.257 --> 01:16:52.303
We've pushed him too far.

01:16:52.346 --> 01:16:53.672
We should let him
drift off to sleep.

01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:56.655
No. No.

01:16:56.699 --> 01:16:59.658
Rick, forget about it.
It's not safe.

01:16:59.702 --> 01:17:01.965
Man, I wanted the glory
of this as much as you,

01:17:02.008 --> 01:17:03.531
but I can't let you
go on with this.

01:17:03.575 --> 01:17:05.229
Now come on, Rick.

01:17:05.272 --> 01:17:07.666
You could get
permanent brain damage.

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.059
Rick?

01:17:09.102 --> 01:17:10.669
Who you calling "Rick"?

01:17:10.713 --> 01:17:11.714
Rick...

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:13.237
Can't you see?

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.673
I'm an imposter.

01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:16.893
What have you done
with the real Rick?

01:17:17.676 --> 01:17:19.199
Where is he?

01:17:19.243 --> 01:17:20.287
Rick?

01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:21.593
I'm a fake.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:24.465
- I'm an imposter.
- Rick, Rick, listen to me.

01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:26.685
You're not in control
of yourself anymore.

01:17:26.729 --> 01:17:27.880
It's too risky.

01:17:27.904 --> 01:17:30.254
I will not...

01:17:30.297 --> 01:17:32.691
I will not give up.

01:17:32.735 --> 01:17:34.301
Listen to me.

01:17:34.345 --> 01:17:36.913
If you lose enough sleep,
you will die.

01:17:36.956 --> 01:17:38.131
I will not give up.

01:17:38.175 --> 01:17:39.631
And you know
what will finally kill you?

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:42.745
- You'll freeze to death.
- Huh?

01:17:42.788 --> 01:17:44.529
The human body
has an internal thermostat

01:17:44.572 --> 01:17:46.052
that regulates
our body temperature.

01:17:46.096 --> 01:17:47.706
When you lose enough sleep,

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:49.055
your body temperature drops,

01:17:49.099 --> 01:17:50.840
and then you effectively
freeze to death,

01:17:50.883 --> 01:17:53.016
that's if your brain
doesn't hemorrhage first.

01:17:53.059 --> 01:17:54.495
What? Freeze to... Freeze...

01:17:54.539 --> 01:17:55.734
What do you mean
"freeze to death"?

01:17:55.758 --> 01:17:57.760
Well, even in 100-degree
weather,

01:17:57.803 --> 01:17:59.370
that's what will kill him.

01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:02.025
Do you notice how cold you get
when you're tired?

01:18:02.068 --> 01:18:04.027
When his internal thermostat
goes kaput,

01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:05.178
he will go into hypothermia.

01:18:05.202 --> 01:18:06.899
And then...

01:18:06.943 --> 01:18:08.727
And I have videotape of lab rats

01:18:08.771 --> 01:18:10.424
that'll make your skin crawl.

01:18:10.468 --> 01:18:12.078
Look at him.

01:18:12.122 --> 01:18:13.601
Like all warm-blooded creatures,

01:18:13.645 --> 01:18:15.081
he's instinctively
gorging on food

01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:16.735
to try and raise
his body temperature

01:18:16.779 --> 01:18:18.041
when he's so cold inside.

01:18:19.172 --> 01:18:20.217
Mm.

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:21.914
- Rick.
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:21.958 --> 01:18:24.438
I wanted you
to break that record.

01:18:24.482 --> 01:18:26.136
But I'm your doctor first.

01:18:27.006 --> 01:18:29.748
I told you, I'm not Rick.

01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:30.836
I'm an imposter.

01:18:32.011 --> 01:18:33.273
I have to find Rick.

01:18:33.317 --> 01:18:35.623
I have to find Rick.

01:18:35.667 --> 01:18:37.582
Damn it, Phil. Grab him!

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:15.185
Uh, we're...
we're here with Brett,

01:19:16.577 --> 01:19:17.796
and, uh...

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.058
his... his parents.

01:19:20.973 --> 01:19:23.628
Brett is 12.

01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:27.458
And he's... he's known SMA...

01:19:28.546 --> 01:19:29.721
all his life.

01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:34.987
I, I bet that's... difficult.

01:19:36.206 --> 01:19:38.164
Yes. Yes.

01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:43.604
Do you... Do you know of, uh...

01:19:44.997 --> 01:19:49.262
any children
that have already...

01:19:51.569 --> 01:19:53.179
gone?

01:19:53.223 --> 01:19:55.486
Yes. Yes.

01:20:06.323 --> 01:20:08.194
Did... Did you know Clarissa?

01:20:13.156 --> 01:20:14.516
I don't think so.

01:20:16.899 --> 01:20:18.291
Oh... okay.

01:20:23.296 --> 01:20:25.821
We, uh...
I... I know that the...

01:20:27.474 --> 01:20:29.041
There... is there, uh, any...

01:20:29.999 --> 01:20:34.133
anything, money,
whatever, any...

01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:38.746
anything that, that...
that we can do?

01:20:41.314 --> 01:20:42.874
We really need a cure.

01:20:45.579 --> 01:20:48.191
A cure, folks. You heard that.

01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:50.889
Uh...

01:20:50.933 --> 01:20:53.718
We are... are still way under

01:20:53.761 --> 01:20:56.547
our, our five-million-dollar
goal.

01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:58.244
And, uh, there is...

01:20:59.767 --> 01:21:01.552
there isn't enough time
in the world

01:21:01.595 --> 01:21:03.162
to... to help these children.

01:21:06.252 --> 01:21:08.124
So we need to develop a cure.

01:21:12.258 --> 01:21:14.913
Uh, Brett, is, is there...

01:21:14.957 --> 01:21:17.089
any... anything else that...

01:21:18.525 --> 01:21:19.570
you wanna say?

01:21:21.354 --> 01:21:22.921
Never give up.

01:21:35.934 --> 01:21:37.022
Never.

01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:41.592
Never.

01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:15.071
Hey, Rick,
you all right?

01:22:16.235 --> 01:22:17.280
You all right?

01:22:22.198 --> 01:22:24.069
Listen.

01:22:24.113 --> 01:22:26.506
I need to tell you something.

01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:27.830
Well, sure.
What is it?

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.424
I've seen something.

01:22:32.599 --> 01:22:34.993
It's just something...

01:22:35.037 --> 01:22:36.117
What did you see?

01:22:38.736 --> 01:22:40.129
I've seen...

01:22:41.652 --> 01:22:42.914
God.

01:22:45.134 --> 01:22:46.222
I understand.

01:22:47.136 --> 01:22:48.528
The synapses in your brain

01:22:48.572 --> 01:22:50.661
are doing strange things
right now.

01:22:50.704 --> 01:22:51.879
You'll be fine.

01:22:51.923 --> 01:22:52.944
- It's gonna be okay.
- No, no, no.

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:54.447
It's real.

01:22:54.491 --> 01:22:56.145
It's more than real. It's...

01:22:59.365 --> 01:23:01.411
I'm seeing things clearly now.

01:23:03.065 --> 01:23:04.066
And it's...

01:23:06.807 --> 01:23:08.331
beautiful.

01:23:12.944 --> 01:23:15.251
I've looked into eternity.

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:20.256
And He told me...

01:23:22.084 --> 01:23:23.694
that I'm the chosen one.

01:23:27.611 --> 01:23:28.829
A beacon.

01:23:30.048 --> 01:23:31.048
Beacon.

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:34.226
Beacon for hope and light.

01:23:38.143 --> 01:23:40.798
Look at all the faces
of those people out there.

01:23:46.282 --> 01:23:48.023
I can hear their souls.

01:23:52.897 --> 01:23:54.768
And they're crying out...

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:57.641
for help.

01:24:01.645 --> 01:24:04.996
That's what I'm...
That's what I'm doing in here.

01:24:08.869 --> 01:24:10.741
They need to know that...

01:24:12.134 --> 01:24:13.657
they can endure.

01:24:15.789 --> 01:24:17.095
What you need
is a cup of coffee.

01:24:18.749 --> 01:24:20.359
I love you, man.

01:24:21.621 --> 01:24:23.014
I love you.

01:24:25.103 --> 01:24:26.713
- Mm.
- Coffee.

01:24:31.588 --> 01:24:33.024
- Rick?
- Kathy.

01:24:33.938 --> 01:24:35.331
Kathy, I'm a beacon.

01:24:35.374 --> 01:24:36.593
What were you gonna do, Rick?

01:24:36.636 --> 01:24:38.551
Just fake your own death
and skip town?

01:24:38.595 --> 01:24:40.553
Huh? Fake? What?

01:24:40.597 --> 01:24:42.729
Embezzlement, Rick?
Embezzlement?

01:24:42.773 --> 01:24:44.035
You bastard!

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:46.777
I mean, to put all that money
that you stole

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:47.995
in our account.

01:24:48.039 --> 01:24:49.997
I mean, how could you drag me
into this?

01:24:50.041 --> 01:24:51.216
Are you kidding me?

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:52.870
I mean, I knew you were
a selfish jerk.

01:24:52.913 --> 01:24:54.413
- This is... This is crazy.
- But I had no idea

01:24:54.437 --> 01:24:55.588
- that you were a thief!
- Um, I'm checking our account.

01:24:55.612 --> 01:24:57.222
The press
has our bank statements.

01:24:57.266 --> 01:24:58.876
They are harassing me, Rick!

01:24:58.919 --> 01:25:00.921
They are calling me,
and they know, okay?

01:25:00.965 --> 01:25:02.532
They know.
What the hell are you doing?

01:25:02.575 --> 01:25:04.099
Are you giving it to them?

01:25:04.142 --> 01:25:05.970
Holy shit. Password.

01:25:06.013 --> 01:25:08.015
What the hell
are you doing over there?

01:25:08.886 --> 01:25:10.757
Radio god.

01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:14.239
How could you be so dumb

01:25:14.283 --> 01:25:15.980
to put it in our account?

01:25:16.676 --> 01:25:18.548
Oh, no, no.

01:25:18.591 --> 01:25:20.767
No, no, no!

01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:27.905
Son of a bitch.

01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:43.399
What the hell's going on?

01:25:44.226 --> 01:25:45.575
Must be this, Rick.

01:25:52.712 --> 01:25:53.713
Hello?

01:25:54.758 --> 01:25:55.802
Hey, what's up, Cliff?

01:25:56.847 --> 01:25:58.544
Cliff?

01:25:58.588 --> 01:26:00.764
- I've been set up.
- Relax, Rick.

01:26:00.807 --> 01:26:03.201
I've already got the FCC
breathing down my neck.

01:26:03.245 --> 01:26:04.855
Don't...
Don't pull the plug, Cliff.

01:26:04.898 --> 01:26:07.249
We'll, uh, we'll still raise
the five million.

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:09.033
Enough!
Don't say anymore!

01:26:09.076 --> 01:26:10.687
We could lose
our license over this.

01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:11.992
Don't you dare!

01:26:13.124 --> 01:26:14.908
No!

01:26:22.786 --> 01:26:23.961
See you later...

01:26:25.571 --> 01:26:27.051
radio god.

01:26:44.024 --> 01:26:45.524
- Look. Hey.
- You ruined it.

01:26:45.548 --> 01:26:47.047
- Listen, Browning.
- You ruined it!

01:26:47.071 --> 01:26:49.595
We can finish this.

01:26:49.639 --> 01:26:51.945
- You and I.
- It's over.

01:26:51.989 --> 01:26:54.992
No, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, let me fix this.

01:26:55.035 --> 01:26:56.622
- Let me fix...
- You'll be dead

01:26:56.646 --> 01:26:57.908
in a few minutes.

01:26:59.605 --> 01:27:01.041
I'm coming for you.

01:27:01.781 --> 01:27:02.826
Right now.

01:28:06.455 --> 01:28:08.587
Marcus. Marcus, please.

01:28:08.631 --> 01:28:09.893
He's trying to kill me.

01:28:09.936 --> 01:28:11.982
It's Rick, it's Rick.
He's trying to kill me.

01:28:12.025 --> 01:28:13.438
- Whoa. Slow down, Rick.
- Now, could you help me,

01:28:13.462 --> 01:28:14.854
- Marcus?
- What?

01:28:14.898 --> 01:28:16.465
Marcus, you have to put me
on the air.

01:28:16.508 --> 01:28:18.249
Just go put me on the air.
I, I, I...

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:20.643
I can't die like this.
I can't die like this.

01:28:20.686 --> 01:28:23.080
What are you talking about?
Who's trying to kill you?

01:28:23.123 --> 01:28:24.603
Just put me on the air.

01:28:24.647 --> 01:28:26.605
It's not a hoax, believe me.

01:28:26.649 --> 01:28:28.322
- Believe me!
- Dude. Dude, I can't.

01:28:28.346 --> 01:28:29.913
Man, I'll lose my job.

01:28:29.956 --> 01:28:31.847
Marcus, Marcus, whatever...
whatever you thought about me...

01:28:31.871 --> 01:28:33.482
Yo, if... Listen, listen.

01:28:33.525 --> 01:28:35.024
If someone's trying to kill you,
why don't you call the police?

01:28:35.048 --> 01:28:36.287
- Why're you calling me?
- Put me on the air.

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:38.138
Just tell Charlene...

01:28:38.182 --> 01:28:40.837
Tell Charlene to just
call Murdoch and listen in.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.056
Dude, I can't put you on, dude!

01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:44.382
Oh, shit.

01:28:44.406 --> 01:28:45.755
He's calling.

01:28:45.798 --> 01:28:47.322
I'll...

01:28:47.365 --> 01:28:49.019
I'll conference call him.

01:28:49.062 --> 01:28:50.368
I'll conference call him,

01:28:50.412 --> 01:28:52.327
and... and you can hear it
for yourself. Okay?

01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:53.521
We're gonna
catch him together.

01:28:53.545 --> 01:28:55.330
Put me on the air!

01:28:57.375 --> 01:28:58.942
Browning.

01:28:58.985 --> 01:29:00.441
Where do you think
you're running to, Rick?

01:29:00.465 --> 01:29:01.771
Nowhere to go.

01:29:06.079 --> 01:29:07.994
Fuck.

01:29:10.997 --> 01:29:14.653
The following is Rick Weider,
WZLW Radio.

01:29:14.697 --> 01:29:18.091
You're about to hear
radio history in the making.

01:29:18.135 --> 01:29:20.703
Browning, Browning,
you've got to listen to me.

01:29:20.746 --> 01:29:22.835
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me. It was Phil.

01:29:22.879 --> 01:29:24.402
It was...
It was the intern, Phil.

01:29:24.446 --> 01:29:26.709
That prick. He...

01:29:26.752 --> 01:29:29.494
He... He stole the money,
and he put it in my account.

01:29:29.538 --> 01:29:30.713
It was him.

01:29:30.756 --> 01:29:32.889
Always blaming someone else.

01:29:35.718 --> 01:29:38.808
- Get off me, man.
- You knew my password.

01:29:38.851 --> 01:29:40.133
And you transferred the money
into my account.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:43.813
You called the newspaper.
You set me up.

01:29:43.856 --> 01:29:46.250
The show is over, Rick.
Give it up.

01:29:51.211 --> 01:29:52.778
Phil took the money.

01:29:52.822 --> 01:29:54.519
Tell him.

01:29:56.565 --> 01:29:57.609
Bastard!

01:30:01.004 --> 01:30:02.179
Rick, what's happening, dude?

01:30:15.453 --> 01:30:16.933
Hey, hold on. Hold on, hold on.

01:30:16.976 --> 01:30:18.258
What are you doing in here?

01:30:18.282 --> 01:30:19.564
What are you guys doing?

01:30:19.588 --> 01:30:21.807
He's after us. Shut up!
This is all your fault!

01:30:21.851 --> 01:30:23.437
- We're closed.
- Do not listen to this,

01:30:23.461 --> 01:30:25.047
- this selfish son of a bitch.
- I'm doing this

01:30:25.071 --> 01:30:26.135
charity thing at the moment.

01:30:26.159 --> 01:30:27.223
You want to get a job?

01:30:27.247 --> 01:30:28.727
I can give you a very nice job.

01:30:28.771 --> 01:30:30.139
Please, I'll give you
all the money in the world.

01:30:30.163 --> 01:30:31.208
Please, please help me.

01:30:34.472 --> 01:30:36.058
What's going on?

01:30:36.082 --> 01:30:37.214
Son of a bitch.

01:30:37.257 --> 01:30:38.694
I'm doing this charity thing.

01:30:38.737 --> 01:30:40.019
I will give you
lots of money.

01:30:41.784 --> 01:30:43.152
We're closed,
and you need to leave.

01:30:43.176 --> 01:30:44.656
He's there! He's there!

01:30:54.231 --> 01:30:56.842
Oh, my god.
Did he just get shot?

01:30:58.888 --> 01:31:01.107
Marcus.

01:31:01.151 --> 01:31:02.500
He's okay. He's okay.

01:31:02.544 --> 01:31:05.547
- Yeah, 1-30-43, 1-30-43.
- Go, come on. Come on.

01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:07.070
1-30-43.

01:31:07.113 --> 01:31:08.767
"1-30-43."
What is he talking about?

01:31:09.942 --> 01:31:11.161
Wait, wait, wait.

01:31:11.204 --> 01:31:12.844
I think he's trying
to give us an address.

01:31:33.357 --> 01:31:35.141
You took the money
from dying kids.

01:31:35.185 --> 01:31:36.545
Just shut up
and give me the phone!

01:31:37.143 --> 01:31:38.318
No.

01:31:42.801 --> 01:31:45.282
I was just out
to raise my numbers.

01:31:48.198 --> 01:31:49.721
Steve Larabee.

01:31:49.765 --> 01:31:54.334
Dang him. I sat out there,
so he could play his Top 40.

01:31:54.378 --> 01:31:56.946
Anything, so long
as the numbers go up.

01:31:56.989 --> 01:31:59.035
Right, Phil?

01:31:59.078 --> 01:32:00.645
I don't know anything!

01:32:07.043 --> 01:32:08.131
No.

01:32:09.567 --> 01:32:10.655
It had to be you.

01:32:13.745 --> 01:32:15.442
And Larabee.

01:32:15.486 --> 01:32:17.532
Larabee's got his payoffs.

01:32:17.575 --> 01:32:19.055
From the record companies.

01:32:19.098 --> 01:32:20.709
No, no, no. Get him off the air.

01:32:20.752 --> 01:32:22.425
- Get him off...
- No, no, it's breaking news.

01:32:22.449 --> 01:32:23.514
- Go to commercial.
- It's breaking news.

01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:24.602
You cut into commercial. Move!

01:32:24.626 --> 01:32:25.733
It's breaking news, man!

01:32:25.757 --> 01:32:27.498
- I don't care if it's...
- He stays on!

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:29.108
He stays on!

01:32:29.152 --> 01:32:30.956
- It's my show. He stays on!
- What he's saying...

01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:32.392
- He's lying. Nothing...
- No, no, no.

01:32:32.416 --> 01:32:34.046
- that he's saying in there...
- Rick stays on!

01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:35.613
- No, he's getting off! He's off!
- Rick is staying on!

01:32:35.637 --> 01:32:36.918
- You're fired!
- Rick's staying on.

01:32:36.942 --> 01:32:38.006
- I don't give a damn!
- You're fired!

01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:39.442
- You're getting off.
- I don't care.

01:32:39.466 --> 01:32:40.835
- He's staying on now, though.
- You will never work

01:32:40.859 --> 01:32:42.054
- at another radio station
- Whatever, man.

01:32:42.078 --> 01:32:42.948
- in this country again.
- Whatever. We're tired of you

01:32:42.992 --> 01:32:43.862
- anyway.
- Enjoy unemployment.

01:32:43.906 --> 01:32:44.602
I'm tired of your crap anyway.

01:32:44.646 --> 01:32:45.951
Bitch!

01:32:48.127 --> 01:32:50.086
What's your cut, Phil?

01:32:50.129 --> 01:32:52.349
What's he paying you?

01:32:53.045 --> 01:32:54.090
Huh?

01:32:54.133 --> 01:32:55.874
What did I ever do to you,

01:32:55.918 --> 01:32:58.703
except take your lousy bets?

01:32:58.747 --> 01:33:00.487
You deserved this, Weider.

01:33:02.011 --> 01:33:03.490
You're screwing everyone over

01:33:03.534 --> 01:33:05.101
just as you please.

01:33:09.714 --> 01:33:11.586
Hey! Hey!

01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:16.460
Get your pencil-pushing ass
out of my station!

01:33:16.503 --> 01:33:19.898
Or I will bring down
an investigation on you so hard,

01:33:19.942 --> 01:33:23.902
you will never work
in this industry again.

01:33:23.946 --> 01:33:27.166
And Rick goes back on the air.

01:33:30.909 --> 01:33:33.477
Oh, god.

01:33:34.434 --> 01:33:36.523
This wasn't even about you

01:33:36.567 --> 01:33:38.874
and Larabee embezzling, was it?

01:33:41.964 --> 01:33:44.053
It couldn't be.
The money is in my account.

01:33:44.793 --> 01:33:46.708
Why?

01:33:46.751 --> 01:33:50.537
This was just about
taking me down.

01:33:53.192 --> 01:33:54.324
Why?

01:33:56.326 --> 01:33:57.370
Why?

01:33:58.894 --> 01:33:59.982
For Teresa.

01:34:00.722 --> 01:34:01.766
What?

01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:03.638
She couldn't see me
with you there.

01:34:05.204 --> 01:34:07.642
- I tried so hard.
- What?

01:34:08.599 --> 01:34:10.079
No. No, no, no.

01:34:10.122 --> 01:34:13.169
You're not so hot now,
are you, Rick?

01:34:13.212 --> 01:34:16.041
It can't be. Seriously?
Oh, my god.

01:34:16.955 --> 01:34:19.175
Who the hell is Teresa?

01:34:19.218 --> 01:34:22.657
You did this for a girl?

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:24.702
Why didn't you just
buy her flowers,

01:34:24.746 --> 01:34:26.748
you dumb son of a bitch?

01:34:26.791 --> 01:34:29.315
Morning man Rick Weider
is in the clutches

01:34:29.359 --> 01:34:30.665
of a deadly attacker.

01:34:30.708 --> 01:34:33.232
You are listening to him
via his cell phone.

01:34:33.276 --> 01:34:36.366
This is real, people.
This is happening right now.

01:35:32.639 --> 01:35:33.640
He's gone.

01:35:35.904 --> 01:35:36.948
I'm out of here.

01:35:39.429 --> 01:35:40.691
Later, loser.

01:36:55.984 --> 01:36:57.942
Phil, run!

01:37:07.865 --> 01:37:09.649
Oh, god. Oh, god.

01:37:22.749 --> 01:37:25.013
This is live, people.
This is not a game.

01:37:25.056 --> 01:37:26.492
His life is in jeopardy.

01:37:26.536 --> 01:37:28.755
He is in the clutches
of a deadly attacker.

01:38:36.867 --> 01:38:38.086
No.

01:38:39.043 --> 01:38:41.132
No. Wait.

01:38:42.264 --> 01:38:43.265
Wait.

01:38:44.266 --> 01:38:45.310
Wait.

01:38:48.226 --> 01:38:50.185
Uh, wait.

01:38:51.186 --> 01:38:52.622
- You failed.
- Wait.

01:38:52.665 --> 01:38:54.232
You failed!

01:38:54.276 --> 01:38:55.973
You failed!

01:38:56.017 --> 01:38:57.124
You failed!

01:38:57.148 --> 01:38:58.280
God, no.

01:38:59.542 --> 01:39:00.804
No.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:03.850
- No.
- You failed.

01:39:06.592 --> 01:39:07.854
You failed!

01:39:10.509 --> 01:39:11.510
Oh.

01:39:13.034 --> 01:39:14.992
- Still breathing.
- We have one down. Roll EMS.

01:39:19.736 --> 01:39:22.565
How about... How about Clarissa?

01:39:24.349 --> 01:39:25.742
Is...

01:39:25.785 --> 01:39:27.396
Is this what she wanted?

01:39:28.745 --> 01:39:29.746
How about...

01:39:30.355 --> 01:39:31.443
Clarissa?

01:39:33.228 --> 01:39:35.404
Clarissa.

01:39:35.447 --> 01:39:39.103
Clarissa...
is that what she wanted?

01:39:40.061 --> 01:39:41.714
You don't know the pressure.

01:39:43.194 --> 01:39:44.413
The doctors.

01:39:46.632 --> 01:39:48.156
The constant whining.

01:39:50.941 --> 01:39:51.942
Crying.

01:39:53.204 --> 01:39:54.553
Excuses.

01:39:57.817 --> 01:39:59.906
She'd be finishing college now.

01:40:01.691 --> 01:40:03.214
My little girl.

01:40:05.086 --> 01:40:06.565
My little girl.

01:40:09.438 --> 01:40:12.006
She didn't die of SMA, did she?

01:40:15.096 --> 01:40:17.707
That's why she wasn't
on the list.

01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:20.579
Oh, is this...

01:40:22.451 --> 01:40:24.018
Is this how she died?

01:40:26.107 --> 01:40:27.978
You did it, didn't you?

01:40:30.502 --> 01:40:32.635
You murdered your own daughter.

01:40:34.463 --> 01:40:37.466
She was suffering.

01:40:38.989 --> 01:40:39.990
No.

01:40:40.991 --> 01:40:42.514
No, you were suffering.

01:40:44.168 --> 01:40:45.952
You were suffering.

01:40:45.996 --> 01:40:48.042
And you couldn't
take it anymore.

01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:51.088
And you killed her.

01:40:51.958 --> 01:40:54.352
You gave up on her.

01:40:54.396 --> 01:40:56.572
You gave up on her!

01:40:56.615 --> 01:41:00.054
- You did. You gave up on her...
- You don't know!

01:41:00.097 --> 01:41:03.100
You don't know what it's like...

01:41:03.144 --> 01:41:05.494
to look at all the other kids,

01:41:05.537 --> 01:41:08.584
and see them,
and how happy they are!

01:41:09.585 --> 01:41:11.369
And you were weak.

01:41:13.371 --> 01:41:16.461
And you killed... Clarissa.

01:41:24.469 --> 01:41:25.905
She was six,

01:41:27.037 --> 01:41:28.952
and I was giving her a bath.

01:41:31.694 --> 01:41:34.218
And I pushed her head
under the water.

01:41:35.785 --> 01:41:38.353
I pushed her head
under the water.

01:41:52.671 --> 01:41:54.456
But I'm not giving up.

01:41:56.501 --> 01:41:58.547
I'm not giving up.

01:41:59.939 --> 01:42:01.898
We can do it.

01:42:01.941 --> 01:42:03.856
Together,
we can raise the money.

01:42:04.901 --> 01:42:07.164
We can still raise the money.

01:42:07.208 --> 01:42:09.340
For the kids.
We can still do it.

01:42:09.384 --> 01:42:11.734
We don't have to stop. Together.

01:42:13.039 --> 01:42:16.173
You have to die.

01:42:18.306 --> 01:42:20.569
You need to die.

01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:25.791
Yeah.

01:42:27.837 --> 01:42:29.447
Yeah, you're right.

01:42:36.324 --> 01:42:37.499
Kathy.

01:42:40.197 --> 01:42:41.720
Kathy.

01:42:41.764 --> 01:42:43.635
I love you, Kathy.

01:42:43.679 --> 01:42:45.463
Kathy.

01:42:45.507 --> 01:42:47.509
I love you, Kathy.

01:42:50.425 --> 01:42:53.036
Come on, asshole...

01:42:54.429 --> 01:42:56.213
and kill me.

01:42:58.302 --> 01:43:00.783
Hey, hey! Hey, take the money!

01:43:00.826 --> 01:43:03.612
Hey, take the money!

01:43:04.526 --> 01:43:06.223
For the kids.

01:43:06.267 --> 01:43:08.573
It's great publicity.

01:43:08.617 --> 01:43:10.836
Let's do it.

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.708
Do it, and we'll raise millions.

01:43:15.145 --> 01:43:16.842
Do it for the kids!

01:43:18.757 --> 01:43:19.845
Freeze!

01:43:43.434 --> 01:43:44.522
You okay, Rick?

01:43:47.482 --> 01:43:48.483
Rick?

01:43:51.181 --> 01:43:53.009
I gotta find Rick.

01:43:53.052 --> 01:43:54.750
I gotta find Rick.

01:43:54.793 --> 01:43:57.796
- What the hell?
- I gotta find Rick.

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.234
Browning down.
Weider on the run.

01:44:00.277 --> 01:44:02.584
Find that lunatic! Now.

01:45:14.133 --> 01:45:15.134
Oh, god.

01:45:16.397 --> 01:45:17.398
Rick.

01:45:24.318 --> 01:45:25.928
Kathy.

01:45:25.971 --> 01:45:29.323
Kathy, I'm never ever
gonna give up on you.

01:45:30.324 --> 01:45:31.325
I won't...

01:45:34.371 --> 01:45:35.894
I won't give up on you.

01:45:38.419 --> 01:45:39.594
I just...

01:45:40.769 --> 01:45:42.292
I just really...

01:45:43.467 --> 01:45:44.642
really need some...
