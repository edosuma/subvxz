00:56.940 --> 00:59.485
Joe Blake and Terry Collins.

00:59.485 --> 01:00.778
This is lieutenant McCormick...

01:00.819 --> 01:04.031
.. of the Los Angeles Police Department.

01:04.072 --> 01:07.618
Put down your weapons
and come out of the bank...

01:07.618 --> 01:10.162
.. with your hands in the air.

01:10.162 --> 01:11.622
"One last big heist."

01:11.663 --> 01:13.082
What a great idea!

01:13.165 --> 01:15.084
Yeah, Joe knows best.

01:15.125 --> 01:16.126
Yes, siree.

01:16.126 --> 01:17.920
Joe knows exactly what he's doing.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.797
Exactly what he's doing.

01:19.797 --> 01:21.131
What is Joe getting me?

01:21.215 --> 01:22.675
Stuck in a bank called The Alamo...

01:22.675 --> 01:25.260
.. surrounded by the entire
Los Angeles Police Department.

01:25.344 --> 01:26.261
Look out there!

01:26.929 --> 01:27.930
Remember now people.

01:27.930 --> 01:31.517
These guys haven't been prone to
violence yet, in any of these incidents.

01:31.517 --> 01:33.977
So, everybody just stay real calm.
All right?

01:33.977 --> 01:35.979
Joe Black and Terry Collins
have finally met their match.

01:35.979 --> 01:37.940
I think they're running out of luck
very quickly.

01:37.940 --> 01:39.942
They're gonna need more tricks up
their sleeves than Siegfried & Roy...

01:39.942 --> 01:41.694
.. if they think they're gonna
get out of this one.

01:41.694 --> 01:43.445
If you're just turning in, we're in front
of the Alamo Savings and Loans...

01:43.445 --> 01:44.697
right here in Century City.

01:44.780 --> 01:46.573
The place looks like a war zone.

01:46.699 --> 01:48.701
The troops are moving in here...

01:48.701 --> 01:50.828
.. the SWAT team is moving in,
the helicopters...

01:50.869 --> 01:53.997
Lao Tzu says,
that even the softest of things...

01:54.123 --> 01:56.834
.. can pass through a horse
like invisible water.

01:57.001 --> 02:00.421
Thank you for that completely
useless bit of information, Joe.

02:00.462 --> 02:02.256
You know what your problem is?
Huh?

02:02.297 --> 02:03.257
My problem?
Yeah.

02:03.298 --> 02:05.801
I'm trapped like a rat!

02:05.801 --> 02:07.011
Destined for an early grave.

02:07.011 --> 02:09.013
Kate Wheeler.

02:09.013 --> 02:11.557
You remember Kate.

02:11.557 --> 02:13.142
Traitor...

02:13.183 --> 02:14.143
.. liar...

02:14.184 --> 02:16.603
.. queen of double-cross...

02:16.729 --> 02:17.604
.. empress of deceit.

02:17.730 --> 02:18.605
Hey, duchess.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.607
I get your point. OK?

02:20.733 --> 02:22.484
Oh, do you Joe?

02:22.568 --> 02:23.819
Do you really?

02:23.861 --> 02:25.738
Because as I recall,
I remember warning you...

02:25.738 --> 02:28.699
.. in the strongest language possible

02:28.699 --> 02:31.577
.. that taking on a full time hostage
was an error of epic proportion.

02:31.577 --> 02:33.579
- We had no choice. OK?
- Yes, we did!

02:33.704 --> 02:36.331
Shoot her, and burry her body
in the woods. That was a choice.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.876
Hey! You brought her in!
I recall that!

02:38.876 --> 02:40.044
You know what?
If we had let her go...

02:40.044 --> 02:42.004
.. she would have gone
right to the cops. OK?

02:42.046 --> 02:43.464
Joe, look outside.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.590
She did.

02:46.175 --> 02:48.469
That's exactly what she did.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.889
Kate Wheeler is gonna get the thanks
of a grateful nation.

02:52.056 --> 02:54.892
Not to mention a sizeable reward.

02:57.728 --> 02:59.521
We've got shots fired in the location.

03:09.198 --> 03:11.075
Good evening everybody,
I'm Darren Head...

03:11.158 --> 03:13.494
.. and tonight
we have an incredible story for you.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.538
It's a story that's part soap opera,
part crime drama.

03:16.622 --> 03:18.374
A story of betrayal and greed.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.917
It's part Bonnie and Clyde...

03:19.917 --> 03:21.502
... it's part Barnum and Bailey.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.837
It's a story of Joe Blake
and Terry Collins...

03:23.837 --> 03:25.923
.. the most successful bank robbers..

03:25.923 --> 03:27.758
.. in the history of the United States.

03:27.758 --> 03:30.511
Now, shortly before the bloody
shoot-up that took their lives...

03:30.552 --> 03:33.263
.. I had the opportunity to interview
these men in an exclusive interview...

03:33.347 --> 03:35.057
.. when they broke into my house...

03:35.057 --> 03:37.518
.. and, by gunpoint,
made me tell their story...

03:37.559 --> 03:38.519
.. from their point of view.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.397
Now, the reason I bring this up, is
that the footage you're about to see...

03:41.480 --> 03:44.775
.. was shot on a home video camera
by my personal assistant, Julio.

03:44.817 --> 03:46.527
So, it's a little shaky and
a little wobbly...

03:46.568 --> 03:47.778
.. not exactly professional.

03:47.820 --> 03:50.364
Now, what happened in the wide range
of exchange, is Blake and Collins...

03:50.364 --> 03:51.990
.. revealed to me
for the first time anywhere...

03:52.074 --> 03:54.368
.. the inside story,
of the daring robberies...

03:54.493 --> 03:55.953
.. that made themselves famous.

03:55.953 --> 03:58.789
24 hours later,
Blake and Collins were dead.

03:58.789 --> 04:00.082
Now, we have an exclusive...
OK.

04:00.082 --> 04:01.542
Again.

04:01.583 --> 04:04.712
24 hours later,
Blake and Collins were dead.

04:04.795 --> 04:07.297
So, tonight,
on a very special edition...

04:07.381 --> 04:08.257
.. of "Criminals at Large"...

04:08.966 --> 04:11.385
.. the inside story,
the true story...

04:11.385 --> 04:13.887
.. of the "Sleep-Over Bandits".

04:13.971 --> 04:15.472
And... fade to black.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.141
That was great, guys. I wanna keep
that one. All right.

04:17.141 --> 04:19.267
You got it.
We'll use that one.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.161
It's ridiculous.

04:37.202 --> 04:39.038
If it's not that, it's another.

04:39.038 --> 04:41.707
It's downright unethical...

04:47.504 --> 04:49.882
Nobody wants us to eat this crap.

04:55.220 --> 04:58.057
Hey, Joe!
Joe!

04:58.349 --> 04:59.933
May I have a word with you, please?

05:00.059 --> 05:03.354
Hey, Joe!
It's a violation of my civil rights.

05:03.354 --> 05:04.605
That's what it is.

05:04.730 --> 05:06.357
Cruel and unusual punishment...

05:06.482 --> 05:09.234
.. expressly forbidden
by the Constitution, you hear?

05:09.234 --> 05:12.029
Prison is supposed
to be cruel and unusual, Terry.

05:12.071 --> 05:13.489
That's the whole idea.

05:13.489 --> 05:15.074
That's not what I'm talking about.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.494
What are you talking about?

05:18.494 --> 05:20.245
Garlic.

05:20.329 --> 05:23.499
Warden Cater has banned the sale
of fresh garlic in the commissary...

05:23.540 --> 05:25.376
.. because he doesn't like the smell.

05:25.459 --> 05:29.380
You see Joe, it's like a...
.. it's a miracle drug.

05:29.463 --> 05:33.801
High blood pressure,
and arthritis, and cancer...

05:33.801 --> 05:36.929
.. emphysema, allergies, anything.

05:36.929 --> 05:39.139
Garlic is the first line of defense.
Always.

05:39.223 --> 05:40.557
Hold on one second, mate.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.810
Do you hear what I'm saying?

05:45.396 --> 05:47.231
And I got symptoms.

05:47.231 --> 05:49.483
I don't care what that doctor says.

05:51.068 --> 05:53.946
Maybe now it's not a good time
to talk about garlic?

05:55.572 --> 05:58.367
Hey, Joe. You know.
Don't worry about it.

05:58.367 --> 05:59.952
Once you come down on that ring...

05:59.952 --> 06:02.413
.. don't... don't do
what I think you're gonna do. Please!

06:02.413 --> 06:04.081
You remember what I told you,
right Joe?

06:04.123 --> 06:05.874
Don't... don't... don't do the...

06:05.958 --> 06:07.543
You really chipped my tooth, Mario.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.171
Joe, for God's sake.
Joe!

06:17.845 --> 06:19.263
Joe!
Joe, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

06:19.304 --> 06:20.848
Joe!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:20.973 --> 06:23.726
Joe!
Joe, anger management.

06:23.809 --> 06:25.853
Anger mana...
Joe!.. Joe! Joe! Joe!

06:25.978 --> 06:27.396
Anger management!

06:27.479 --> 06:30.149
Joe!
Calm down.

06:30.149 --> 06:31.150
Breathe.

06:47.458 --> 06:49.293
Have you read the Tao?

06:49.293 --> 06:50.419
Sorry?

06:51.462 --> 06:53.922
You know, that guy, Lao...

06:57.801 --> 06:58.761
Lao Tzu.

06:58.802 --> 07:00.721
Now, here you go. Lao Tzu.

07:00.763 --> 07:03.515
You know Joe, I've begged you
to stay out of the library.

07:03.599 --> 07:05.809
You've begged me to work
on my anger management.

07:05.809 --> 07:07.728
Yeah, well, medication's quicker.

07:09.355 --> 07:10.814
It's much more effective.

07:16.028 --> 07:17.029
You know what?

07:19.615 --> 07:22.201
I would like to sleep
in a comfortable bed tonight.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.788
And to have me a cheeseburger...

07:27.623 --> 07:28.916
.. French fries...

07:28.916 --> 07:31.460
.. big old chocolate milk-shake
for dinner.

07:31.460 --> 07:34.380
Ancient Chinese wisdom?

07:34.380 --> 07:36.048
No, just hungry.

07:39.218 --> 07:40.928
I definitely chipped my tooth.

07:42.346 --> 07:44.098
For the love of God...

07:44.098 --> 07:47.142
Does no one else hear that
infernal ringing?

07:48.519 --> 07:50.396
Oh, yes. Sure. Go ahead and laugh.

07:50.396 --> 07:52.690
But according to the latest research...

07:52.773 --> 07:56.819
...Tinnitus, which is what they call it,
that's what I've got in my ear...

07:56.819 --> 07:59.238
.. I don't make this shit up,
is an actual disease.

08:03.575 --> 08:04.827
Go ahead and laugh.

08:04.868 --> 08:06.787
Play basketball, have fun.

08:06.829 --> 08:10.708
In the mean time, I've got goddamn
Quasimodo going off in my head.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.668
Bell tower, you understand me?

08:12.668 --> 08:15.087
I got a bell tower in my head!

08:20.718 --> 08:22.136
Hey, you're the driver of this thing?

08:22.136 --> 08:23.262
Yeah.

08:23.262 --> 08:25.681
Pretty easy to drive, is it?

08:25.723 --> 08:27.307
Pretty easy.

08:30.561 --> 08:31.311
Joe?

08:36.734 --> 08:39.903
Oh, my God Joe! What are you doing
in a cement truck?

08:40.029 --> 08:42.155
Joe? Joe!?

08:48.162 --> 08:50.706
Joe, what am I doing?

08:50.706 --> 08:51.915
What am I doing?

09:11.477 --> 09:13.187
Why are we in a concrete thing...

09:13.187 --> 09:15.189
.. getting shot at?

09:15.189 --> 09:16.607
Just keep your head down!

09:30.079 --> 09:31.330
Take it down!

09:37.336 --> 09:40.089
Joe! Jesus Christ!
Straight ahead is a truck!

10:07.783 --> 10:11.078
- How long have you been planning this?
- It just sort of came up.

10:18.961 --> 10:20.421
Hang on to something!

10:33.726 --> 10:34.977
Deer!

10:36.437 --> 10:37.563
Plastic.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.029
Don't you think
we should be looking for a road?

11:01.170 --> 11:02.171
Joe?

11:02.338 --> 11:03.464
Stop. Stop, please.

11:03.505 --> 11:04.590
Madam.

11:05.591 --> 11:06.925
We're gonna need
to borrow your car.

11:06.925 --> 11:07.926
You are?

11:07.926 --> 11:10.054
Yes. Would you just leave it
for a second, please?

11:12.806 --> 11:14.516
Come on. Here you go. Very nice.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.601
Thank you.

11:18.479 --> 11:20.356
It's a really lovely dress.

11:20.356 --> 11:22.191
Thank you.

11:23.192 --> 11:24.318
Come on.

11:24.318 --> 11:26.195
Thank you!
Get in the car.

11:27.363 --> 11:28.947
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

11:30.783 --> 11:32.368
Don't forget your purse.

11:32.451 --> 11:33.619
Thank you.

11:43.545 --> 11:45.798
OK. First things first. We need...
What do we need?

11:45.798 --> 11:47.341
We need clothes...

11:47.341 --> 11:49.927
.. we need money...

11:49.927 --> 11:51.553
.. place to hide...

11:51.679 --> 11:53.097
We'd better get a new car
pretty quick.

11:53.138 --> 11:54.807
I don't feel good about
driving up Main Street...

11:54.807 --> 11:56.350
.. wearing clothes that say "inmate".

11:56.350 --> 11:58.352
Do you know what I mean?

11:58.394 --> 11:59.937
And why are we stopping here?

12:00.062 --> 12:02.356
This is where they keep the cash.

12:05.943 --> 12:06.944
The cash!?

12:07.695 --> 12:09.363
Hey! Stupid!

12:12.491 --> 12:13.659
What cash?

12:16.453 --> 12:18.539
Didn't you say something
about needing money?

12:18.539 --> 12:19.832
Oh, yeah.
But I mean not right now.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.083
Look, Joe.

12:21.083 --> 12:22.167
Let's just discuss this for a minute.

12:22.167 --> 12:23.836
I mean, I know that money's
on the list...

12:23.836 --> 12:25.963
.. but it's not at the top of the list.

12:26.088 --> 12:27.840
- Bingo.
- Bingo, what?

12:27.840 --> 12:30.092
What do you mean, "Bingo"?

12:30.092 --> 12:32.845
Are you gonna knock-over a bank
with a "magic marker"?

12:32.886 --> 12:34.847
I mean, what are you gonna do?
Write on them?

12:34.847 --> 12:36.098
We don't even have a plan.

12:36.098 --> 12:38.976
You have to have
some kind of plan to rob a bank.

12:39.018 --> 12:41.729
We're wearing matching damn
uniforms that say "inmate" on them.

12:41.729 --> 12:44.857
Unless these people are blind,
I don't think this is gonna work.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.567
Do you understand?

12:49.737 --> 12:51.030
Don't move.

12:51.030 --> 12:54.158
Take out your gun,
thumb an middle finger on the butt...

12:54.199 --> 12:55.826
.. hand it to me slowly.

12:55.826 --> 12:56.827
Here we go.

12:56.827 --> 12:57.786
Here we go. Here we go.

12:57.786 --> 12:59.788
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be out
of your lane in just a second.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.790
No phone calls, no alarms, please!

13:01.874 --> 13:03.042
Cash doors, open!

13:03.042 --> 13:05.794
Take a bag, fill it with cash!

13:05.794 --> 13:06.795
Cash, please!

13:06.795 --> 13:08.339
Ma'am, is there any other cash
in the back?

13:08.339 --> 13:09.048
No.

13:09.048 --> 13:10.466
Don't touch that phone, sir!

13:10.507 --> 13:11.592
Are you sure?
Don't touch that!

13:11.633 --> 13:13.635
- Are you telling me the truth?
- I'm telling you the truth.

13:13.719 --> 13:14.928
You look very honest.

13:15.054 --> 13:16.597
Quickly, please!
Thank you! Thank you!

13:16.638 --> 13:19.433
He made,
he made no plan whatsoever for this.

13:19.475 --> 13:20.601
Here we go!
Put that right in there.

13:20.642 --> 13:21.518
I'll take it.

13:21.602 --> 13:22.936
Thank you! Thank you!

13:23.062 --> 13:24.063
I'll take that! Here we go!

13:24.188 --> 13:26.315
OK. Thank you very much.

13:28.359 --> 13:31.945
There's just never enough time
when you're working.

13:32.071 --> 13:33.614
Thank you for your cooperation!

13:33.655 --> 13:35.491
No phone calls! No alarms!

13:35.491 --> 13:37.076
Here we go! Come on!

13:37.076 --> 13:38.952
Take this.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.954
Sir! In case
you need to highlight anything!

13:41.080 --> 13:42.539
Here we go! Let's go!

13:45.918 --> 13:47.544
Hey! Hey!
Stop! Stop!

13:47.670 --> 13:50.214
- Hey! Ho! Ho, ho! Ho!
- What?

13:50.214 --> 13:52.466
Sir?
I need to borrow your car.

13:52.466 --> 13:53.801
Take the bus, asshole.

13:56.220 --> 13:57.805
Hey! Come on!
This car!

13:57.805 --> 14:00.224
Let's go! No, no!
This car! This!

14:16.407 --> 14:17.783
Have the gun?

14:19.827 --> 14:21.120
No.

14:25.457 --> 14:27.084
Goddamn it!
Hold it!

14:27.668 --> 14:29.962
Come on. Stop it. Act regular.

14:51.692 --> 14:53.902
Chest pain, left arm a little numb...

14:53.902 --> 14:55.821
.. accelerated heart beats, spots.

14:55.863 --> 14:58.323
I'm actually seeing spots.

15:04.705 --> 15:06.707
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on!

15:16.592 --> 15:18.802
Out! Out! Out! Out! Out!

15:21.180 --> 15:22.806
Hey Terry, come here.

15:44.662 --> 15:45.788
It's all right.

15:47.206 --> 15:49.792
May I, please, go back to prison?

15:49.917 --> 15:51.335
Not yet.

16:40.843 --> 16:42.302
Oh, shit!

17:14.585 --> 17:16.420
What's your name?

17:16.462 --> 17:17.628
Cheri.

17:17.713 --> 17:19.714
Zip up your pants, Cheri.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.137
You too.

17:25.179 --> 17:26.637
I'm Phil.

17:28.182 --> 17:30.642
So, where's your mom, Cheri?

17:30.726 --> 17:33.604
My mom doesn't live here anymore.

17:33.645 --> 17:34.646
And your dad?

17:34.646 --> 17:37.483
Oh, he's fishing for the weekend.

17:37.483 --> 17:39.735
So your dad left you here all alone.

17:39.735 --> 17:43.739
Oh, no, he thinks
I'm at a friend's house.

17:43.739 --> 17:46.200
And how about you, scooter?

17:46.200 --> 17:48.661
I told my folks I had a soccer trip.

17:48.661 --> 17:51.955
Lie to your parents?

17:51.955 --> 17:53.666
You're kidding, right?

17:53.666 --> 17:55.668
No, I'm not kidding.

18:00.923 --> 18:02.466
I'm sorry...

18:02.466 --> 18:05.469
.. who are you, guys?

18:05.469 --> 18:07.930
Hey, you're inmates.

18:09.473 --> 18:11.475
What'd you say your name was?

18:11.475 --> 18:13.477
Phil!?

18:13.477 --> 18:16.480
Do you think there's something
funny about being an inmate, Phil?

18:21.235 --> 18:23.821
We're bank robbers, OK?

18:33.956 --> 18:35.708
So, what's on our mind?

18:37.418 --> 18:39.420
Paraiso del Mar.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.422
Paraiso?

18:41.422 --> 18:44.133
Paradise.

18:44.174 --> 18:49.013
My uncle owns this little hotel, on the
water, about 100 miles south of Acapulco.

18:49.013 --> 18:50.681
That's Mexico.

18:50.723 --> 18:53.392
Right. That's where
they keep Acapulco, Terry.

18:53.434 --> 18:55.602
But I have sanitation issues, Joe.

18:55.686 --> 19:00.107
We'll buy the hotel, turn in into a
night-club and resort...

19:00.149 --> 19:04.194
.. I could wear a tuxedo,
sell margaritas to the tourists...

19:04.194 --> 19:06.196
We could have some fun.

19:08.323 --> 19:09.992
You'd do that!?

19:09.992 --> 19:11.618
I mean, you and me.

19:11.702 --> 19:13.579
Yeah.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.705
Partners?

19:14.705 --> 19:15.914
Partners.

19:18.459 --> 19:21.420
Tuxedos and margaritas?

19:21.420 --> 19:22.421
Good, right?

19:22.463 --> 19:23.464
Yeah.

19:23.464 --> 19:25.924
I could run the kitchen, you could
work the room...

19:27.426 --> 19:31.180
It's a high-risk business, but,
considering the alternatives...

19:31.180 --> 19:32.723
I think that sounds really good.

19:35.434 --> 19:37.728
Just have one question.
How do we pay for it?

19:37.895 --> 19:39.646
Well...

19:41.648 --> 19:43.359
.. we are bank robbers.

19:46.945 --> 19:48.364
So, where is it?

19:48.364 --> 19:51.200
Below my belt and above my knees.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.951
No. You know what I mean.

19:52.951 --> 19:54.953
You're gonna get us killed.

19:56.455 --> 19:58.457
Maybe I'll save the day.

19:58.499 --> 20:00.668
We'll both be rich and famous
and on TV.

20:00.668 --> 20:02.461
I think there's a way to do it right.

20:02.628 --> 20:03.921
I'm sure of it.

20:03.921 --> 20:06.465
So, where is it?

20:06.465 --> 20:10.219
In daddy's closet,
behind the golf clubs.

20:12.930 --> 20:14.098
All right, I'm going.

20:15.641 --> 20:18.477
What's the biggest problem,
every time you rob a bank?

20:18.477 --> 20:19.478
Getting caught?

20:19.478 --> 20:20.688
Exactly.

20:20.688 --> 20:22.690
There's guards to shoot at you...

20:22.690 --> 20:23.857
.. there's tellers to hit alarms...

20:23.857 --> 20:25.651
.. there's customers
to get in the way, right?

20:25.693 --> 20:26.694
You're right.

20:27.695 --> 20:29.405
You need to control the environment.

20:29.405 --> 20:31.990
No guards, no tellers, no customers.

20:31.990 --> 20:34.076
Yeah, but if you work at night...

20:34.076 --> 20:36.078
.. you still gotta deal with the alarms.

20:36.078 --> 20:37.454
But we don't work at night.

20:39.248 --> 20:41.000
When you do it?
Holidays?

20:41.125 --> 20:42.167
No.

20:45.421 --> 20:47.715
We do it with the bank manager...

20:47.715 --> 20:53.429
in the morning, with the bank manager's
keys and the bank manager's vault codes.

20:53.429 --> 20:56.140
Because we kidnap him
the night before.

20:57.975 --> 20:59.143
I mean, think about it.

20:59.184 --> 21:01.145
We pick a town, we pick a bank...

21:01.145 --> 21:02.730
.. we find out who's in charge...

21:02.730 --> 21:03.897
.. we pay him a little visit...

21:03.897 --> 21:06.066
.. we spend the night with him,
like we are here...

21:06.066 --> 21:07.735
.. the next morning
we all go to work together...

21:07.860 --> 21:09.737
.. before anybody else gets there...

21:12.740 --> 21:14.700
.. we take the money and run.

21:16.452 --> 21:19.913
Tuxedos and margaritas, Joe,
just like you said.

21:19.913 --> 21:22.458
Life will be like one big sunset.

21:50.736 --> 21:53.197
Wanna se something neat?

21:54.198 --> 21:56.367
Aim the shotgun at me.

21:56.450 --> 21:58.202
What?

21:58.202 --> 22:00.371
Aim it at me.

22:06.627 --> 22:08.128
Freeze!?

22:08.212 --> 22:10.381
Pretty good.

22:10.381 --> 22:12.675
But first you gotta pump a shell
into the chamber.

22:12.675 --> 22:13.842
Like this.

22:20.224 --> 22:22.685
Neat.

22:22.685 --> 22:24.687
Conversation is over, all right?

22:24.687 --> 22:26.230
Well, I feel good in this color...

22:26.230 --> 22:28.232
.. I've always liked this kind of color.

22:28.357 --> 22:30.818
But you boned me on the pants, Joe.

22:30.943 --> 22:32.653
It's really not fair.
It's a low blow.

22:32.695 --> 22:35.406
I picked those pants out for me,
I laid them out.

22:35.489 --> 22:36.407
I specifically chose those.

22:36.490 --> 22:39.451
Well, well!
Look at you, gentlemen!

22:39.451 --> 22:40.995
Are the clothes all right?

22:42.413 --> 22:44.415
Are we looking spiffy in plaid!

22:44.415 --> 22:45.708
He likes plaid.

22:46.709 --> 22:47.960
Oh!
Two sugars, right?

22:48.127 --> 22:48.961
Thank you very much.

22:49.128 --> 22:51.171
Cheri, we're gonna have
to borrow Phil's car.

22:51.839 --> 22:53.424
Oh! That's OK.
He doesn't mind.

22:53.424 --> 22:54.717
The hell I don't.

22:54.717 --> 22:56.969
It's a new transmission.

22:59.138 --> 23:00.431
So, where are we headed?

23:00.431 --> 23:01.974
Rufus.

23:01.974 --> 23:02.975
Where's Rufus?

23:03.100 --> 23:04.393
It's up the road a little ways.

23:04.435 --> 23:06.395
What's at Rufus?

23:07.730 --> 23:09.440
Pollard...

23:09.606 --> 23:11.608
Harvey Pollard.

23:11.608 --> 23:13.193
What?

23:13.193 --> 23:15.446
Oh, you feel the need to shoot?

23:17.156 --> 23:19.199
Well, go ahead, and shoot then.

23:28.167 --> 23:30.627
Oh, you feel the need to shoot?

23:31.712 --> 23:33.172
Well, go ahead, and shoot then.

23:37.468 --> 23:39.595
What the hell?

23:40.929 --> 23:41.930
Feel the need...

23:53.484 --> 23:54.360
Hey!

23:57.363 --> 23:59.948
Ho, dog!

24:03.494 --> 24:04.495
Joe!?

24:07.498 --> 24:08.499
Joe!

24:11.210 --> 24:12.670
What's up?
I thought you were still in...

24:12.670 --> 24:14.922
No, no. No.
Got out early.

24:14.922 --> 24:15.923
Got out early.

24:15.923 --> 24:16.924
Terry...

24:16.924 --> 24:19.468
.. say hello to my cousin,
Harvey Pollard.

24:19.635 --> 24:20.469
Glad to know you.

24:20.636 --> 24:22.137
Any friend of Joe's, man...

24:22.221 --> 24:23.222
Was that, Harry?

24:25.099 --> 24:25.933
Terry...

24:25.933 --> 24:27.935
Well, those are wicked pants!

24:30.104 --> 24:32.231
So, what are you doing?
Working?

24:32.231 --> 24:33.691
Special effects.

24:33.691 --> 24:35.943
Well, stunt work primarily.

24:35.943 --> 24:37.653
Well, mostly training right now.

24:37.695 --> 24:39.697
Damn squibs don't fire.

24:39.697 --> 24:42.241
We're looking for somebody
that can handle a car.

24:42.366 --> 24:44.118
Well, I can do that!
Why?

24:44.118 --> 24:46.161
Banks.

24:49.415 --> 24:50.457
You're fooling me.

24:52.710 --> 24:55.421
Well, hell, Joe, I'm just the
man you're looking for.

24:55.421 --> 24:56.714
You want a beer?

24:56.714 --> 24:58.132
- Yeah, I'll take a beer.
- OK.

25:05.597 --> 25:07.391
Timer malfunction.

25:07.433 --> 25:08.392
Drop!

25:10.436 --> 25:12.438
I'm gonna get a beer.

25:15.441 --> 25:20.195
He's honest, and he falls real good.

25:24.616 --> 25:28.203
Me, I wanna make a name
for myself with fire.

25:28.412 --> 25:31.206
I've been practicing with gels, you
know, mostly on my hands...

25:31.206 --> 25:33.459
.. but I need a suit.

25:33.459 --> 25:34.877
Harvey, speaking of the job...

25:34.918 --> 25:37.171
Never wondered why a man
sets himself on fire...

25:37.171 --> 25:39.882
.. and jumps off the top
of a 12 story building?

25:39.882 --> 25:41.175
Gosh, no, I didn't, Harv!

25:41.342 --> 25:46.180
Women love
a man who loves danger.

25:47.931 --> 25:50.434
You guys were talking before about the
"front" man, you kept mentioning this guy...

25:50.476 --> 25:52.478
Will you explain to the people at
home and to me...

25:52.644 --> 25:54.938
.. what exactly the "front man" does
and who he is?

25:55.064 --> 25:57.900
Well, well, Darren...

25:58.150 --> 26:01.487
The front man handles pretty much
everything else except robbing the bank.

26:01.487 --> 26:03.197
He... he rents the rooms...

26:03.197 --> 26:07.201
.. he gets the supplies, the food that,
you know, we would eat...

26:07.201 --> 26:09.662
.. he drives the getaway car...

26:09.662 --> 26:10.954
Right.

26:10.954 --> 26:14.500
Joe and I maintain, what you call,
a "low profile".

26:14.500 --> 26:15.459
Right.

26:15.459 --> 26:19.213
If the front man is never seen in a
bank, we're never seen out of one.

26:19.213 --> 26:22.007
And... I plotted
all the banks that we robbed...

26:22.049 --> 26:23.884
.. from Oregon to California...
- Right

26:23.926 --> 26:27.346
Our first bank on the list was
the Oregon City Bank.

26:27.388 --> 26:31.100
So, the schedules, and the routines,
and the bank guards, the tellers...

26:31.100 --> 26:32.101
.. we got it all down.

26:32.142 --> 26:34.478
But mostly, we watched our
first hostage.

26:34.478 --> 26:37.648
Darryl Miller, the bank president,
didn't know it yet...

26:37.648 --> 26:40.150
.. but he was about to spend the
night with the "Sleep-Over Bandits".

26:40.150 --> 26:41.110
Wow.

26:41.110 --> 26:42.236
That sounded good, right?

26:42.236 --> 26:43.404
Yeah, it's pretty...

26:43.404 --> 26:46.156
Didn't know it yet, but he was
about to spend the night with
the "Sleep-Over Bandits".

26:46.407 --> 26:48.075
Yes, it's very newsworthy.

26:48.409 --> 26:50.452
Look! It's his job, all right?
I asked...

26:50.452 --> 26:52.830
.. I asked him
to get me a good mustache...

26:52.830 --> 26:54.957
and he gets me something that looks
like it came out of a cracker-jack box.

26:54.957 --> 26:56.250
This is not about the mustache.

26:56.417 --> 26:57.418
We've got to work.

26:57.584 --> 26:58.877
Well, he's got you a nice wig.

26:58.961 --> 27:00.421
Look at you!
You look great!

27:00.421 --> 27:03.424
Yeah! Have you noticed the burns?
They're kinda flappin'.

27:06.135 --> 27:08.178
Hon, can you get the door?

27:11.181 --> 27:13.726
Everybody, dinner in a half hour!

27:20.858 --> 27:21.900
Howdy.

27:22.985 --> 27:24.737
We're here to rob
your goddamn bank.

27:24.737 --> 27:25.904
Now, just get in there.

27:35.164 --> 27:36.999
It's OK, mummy.

27:49.178 --> 27:51.597
The important thing, here...

27:57.936 --> 28:00.731
The important thing...

28:00.731 --> 28:01.899
The important thing...

28:01.940 --> 28:04.151
.. is that we spend
a quiet night together...

28:04.193 --> 28:05.944
.. and then, tomorrow morning,
bright and early...

28:06.070 --> 28:08.739
.. we all go down
to the bank together, and...

28:08.739 --> 28:12.743
It's really a reasonable proposition,
if you think about it.

28:12.910 --> 28:14.828
Sure.

28:14.912 --> 28:16.372
Whatever you say.

28:16.455 --> 28:17.623
That's the spirit.

28:19.208 --> 28:20.918
Stop playing with your food, Erika.

28:20.918 --> 28:24.463
But it's too long.

28:24.463 --> 28:25.673
Here.

28:25.839 --> 28:29.343
Next time I want you to try to wrap it
round your fork just like daddy does.

28:31.220 --> 28:32.221
Cut mine, mom.

28:32.346 --> 28:33.222
Just a second, hon.

28:33.347 --> 28:35.099
The sauce is too wet.

28:35.140 --> 28:36.100
It's not too wet.

28:36.225 --> 28:38.936
Yes, it is.
The sauce is too wet.

28:47.403 --> 28:50.239
You know, actually Ms. Miller,
this sauce is quite terrific.

28:50.239 --> 28:51.949
- It's brilliant.
- Isn't it?

28:51.991 --> 28:53.826
I hate it.

28:53.867 --> 28:54.827
Thank you.

28:56.954 --> 28:58.455
What time is the vault set for?

28:59.581 --> 29:00.457
7:30.

29:00.582 --> 29:02.376
- Tomato/lemon?
- Yes.

29:04.128 --> 29:05.963
Lemon zest, oregano,
a little cream...

29:05.963 --> 29:07.172
See, I cook a little.

29:07.172 --> 29:08.674
Keys?

29:08.716 --> 29:10.384
Two.

29:10.426 --> 29:11.844
I have one...

29:11.969 --> 29:15.305
.. the operations officer
has the other one.

29:15.389 --> 29:18.058
There's something in here
I can't identify, though.

29:18.058 --> 29:19.101
Is it basil?

29:19.184 --> 29:21.437
No.

29:21.895 --> 29:23.439
Rosemary?
No! Don't tell me!

29:23.605 --> 29:24.732
Don't tell me!

29:24.857 --> 29:26.442
Is not that big of a deal.

29:26.442 --> 29:28.694
It's saffron.

29:30.195 --> 29:31.989
Yes.

29:32.114 --> 29:34.158
Yes, it's saffron.

29:34.199 --> 29:36.201
Bingo!
I knew it!

29:36.201 --> 29:38.704
You know, sometimes
I put a little sugar in mine.

29:38.704 --> 29:40.205
It cuts the acidity.

29:40.205 --> 29:41.749
Pss pss pss... Sugar!

29:41.749 --> 29:44.918
Thank you. I'll try to remember that.

29:44.918 --> 29:45.919
Little tricks, you know.

29:45.919 --> 29:48.422
Wanna see something cool
that I can do?

29:48.464 --> 29:50.174
Sure.

29:55.721 --> 29:57.181
Monica!

29:57.181 --> 29:58.182
What?

29:58.182 --> 30:00.142
We've got guests...

30:00.184 --> 30:02.186
Sort of.

30:09.193 --> 30:12.488
Do you think you're gonna fool
anybody in that getup?

30:12.655 --> 30:14.740
I mean, you look like
Neil Young in that...

30:14.823 --> 30:15.741
What was that album?

30:15.824 --> 30:19.119
"After The Horses" or...

30:19.203 --> 30:21.664
That was "After The Gold Rush"
and that's not that one.

30:21.664 --> 30:24.208
It's the one where he's leaning
against the tree in the snow.

30:24.208 --> 30:26.210
Or whatever. That's what I was
actually going for.

30:26.210 --> 30:29.672
Going out of the bank is almost
as important as getting into it.

30:29.672 --> 30:33.217
The hostages were kept under the
strictest possible guard...

30:33.217 --> 30:37.096
.. to prevent escape
or alarm of any type, you see.

30:37.137 --> 30:40.224
You see,
we had to bring their kids along...

30:40.224 --> 30:42.476
.. the Miller children.

30:43.644 --> 30:44.478
Butane?

30:44.478 --> 30:47.481
Copy this. Butane.

30:47.648 --> 30:49.650
You're all clear and
ready to rock and roll.

30:49.692 --> 30:51.235
Please, turn the music down.

30:51.235 --> 30:52.945
I can't hear a word you said.

30:53.112 --> 30:55.447
"Clear and ready to rock and roll!"

30:55.656 --> 30:56.448
Thank you.

30:56.657 --> 30:58.867
Hey, girls.
You just stay right here.

30:59.868 --> 31:02.454
Everybody should be here
in ten minutes.

31:02.579 --> 31:04.456
What's the "All clear"?

31:04.456 --> 31:05.874
What's that?

31:11.380 --> 31:13.966
Washington, on the inside.

31:13.966 --> 31:15.426
What?

31:15.426 --> 31:16.969
George Washington.

31:16.969 --> 31:20.305
When it's all clear, he's facing in.

31:22.433 --> 31:24.184
Make "All clear", Darill.

31:40.701 --> 31:41.994
Cool.

31:57.885 --> 31:59.720
Three more.

32:01.597 --> 32:02.473
Good morning.

32:02.639 --> 32:03.599
Good morning, Darill.

32:03.599 --> 32:05.893
Good morning, Darill.

32:05.893 --> 32:07.186
Good morning, ladies.

32:08.187 --> 32:10.731
Is this a joke?

32:10.731 --> 32:12.191
No, ma'am.

32:12.191 --> 32:14.485
This is a bank robbery.

32:14.485 --> 32:15.486
Hurry it up.

32:15.486 --> 32:16.654
It's not a parade. Come on.

32:16.737 --> 32:18.113
All righty then.

32:18.197 --> 32:19.490
Just have seat with
everybody else...

32:19.490 --> 32:20.741
It's not gonna take long.

32:20.741 --> 32:21.825
Monica?

32:21.825 --> 32:22.743
I have to go to the bathroom.

32:22.826 --> 32:25.120
No more juice boxes, Cloe. OK?

32:25.204 --> 32:29.500
If it weren't the fact that the
kids had bladders the size of
humming birds...

32:29.625 --> 32:30.918
..yeah, we would've been done.

32:30.918 --> 32:33.212
Well, they drank a lot of juice, Frank.

32:33.379 --> 32:34.922
One of these days
you're gonna get caught.

32:34.922 --> 32:37.508
It's a really dangerous job.
Aren't you a bit scared?

32:37.549 --> 32:38.676
And afraid?

32:39.677 --> 32:41.220
When you know danger
the way we do...

32:41.345 --> 32:44.223
I know it like an animal,
like a wild animal.

32:44.223 --> 32:46.684
You know what they called me
in jail?

32:46.684 --> 32:47.685
No, I don't.

32:47.685 --> 32:48.936
The Panther.

32:48.936 --> 32:51.355
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
very much for your cooperation.

32:51.397 --> 32:52.398
Please, make no attempt to escape...

32:52.398 --> 32:55.484
.. because we will be monitoring
the police scanners,
and we'll kill you if you do.

32:55.484 --> 32:59.446
When you're a well-done machine
you exude danger.

32:59.446 --> 33:00.447
Sure.

33:00.447 --> 33:01.824
People fear you...

33:02.950 --> 33:04.702
.. they fear your presence...

33:04.702 --> 33:06.704
The gun really is secondary.

33:07.705 --> 33:08.956
Thank you.

33:42.197 --> 33:43.198
Now listen.

33:43.198 --> 33:45.200
We go separate ways...

33:45.200 --> 33:47.911
.. two weeks from today
we meet in Klamath Falls.

33:47.911 --> 33:49.204
Right. Now, you take this map.
It's on there.

33:49.204 --> 33:50.456
I wanna go with Joe.

33:50.456 --> 33:51.457
You can't do that.

33:51.582 --> 33:53.000
You can't.
They're looking for two men.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.710
And that's why we're splitting up...

33:54.710 --> 33:55.878
.. going solo, as planned.

33:55.919 --> 33:57.713
What am I supposed to do
for two weeks?

33:57.713 --> 33:59.173
You stay out of trouble.
Try that!

33:59.173 --> 34:00.632
What about the minivan?

34:00.716 --> 34:01.759
You leave it here.

34:01.759 --> 34:03.761
But I like the minivan.
It's roomy.

34:03.802 --> 34:07.431
I appreciate that but,
as it's a stolen minivan...

34:07.473 --> 34:09.475
.. it's probably better
that you leave it here.

34:09.516 --> 34:10.516
Let's go. We gotta go.
Come on.

34:10.516 --> 34:11.476
And what about my money?

34:11.476 --> 34:12.518
Here's yours, right there.

34:12.603 --> 34:14.188
We split it three ways.
Nothing fancy.

34:14.188 --> 34:16.815
I'm buying me a fire suit.
First thing.

34:16.899 --> 34:18.359
I bet I can mail order one out of L.A.

34:18.359 --> 34:20.027
Way to go. Good job, man!

34:20.069 --> 34:21.070
You too, buddy!

34:21.070 --> 34:22.029
Be careful.

34:22.071 --> 34:23.322
Be careful. Stay out of trouble.

34:23.364 --> 34:25.366
What are you gonna buy
with your shares?

34:25.366 --> 34:26.909
Paradise.

34:26.949 --> 34:28.452
Two weeks, Klamath Falls.

34:28.494 --> 34:29.495
Be careful.

34:34.208 --> 34:36.627
Joe Blake and Terry Collins.

34:36.668 --> 34:37.960
This is lieutenant McCormick...

34:38.045 --> 34:40.505
.. from the
Los Angeles Police Department.

34:40.547 --> 34:43.342
Put down your weapons
and come out of the bank...

34:43.384 --> 34:45.386
.. with your hands in the air.

34:50.516 --> 34:52.935
This could be a bad time,
but I just wanna point out...

34:52.935 --> 34:55.978
.. that I did warn you that, that
woman was gonna be the ruin of us.

34:56.063 --> 34:58.399
Right. Understood.

34:59.817 --> 35:03.696
But, as our future looks
rather bleak and miserable...

35:03.696 --> 35:07.533
.. I suggest we figure out
what got us here in the first place.

35:08.867 --> 35:12.079
Which brings us back to that woman.

35:40.899 --> 35:43.277
"The most common symptom
of Vaginitis...

35:43.319 --> 35:46.572
... is an abnormal vaginal discharge,
often..."

35:48.741 --> 35:52.286
"Probably
from an allergic reaction to mites."

36:49.385 --> 36:50.678
Out of gas.

36:50.678 --> 36:51.929
Shit.

37:22.251 --> 37:23.961
What is that smell?

37:25.462 --> 37:27.423
It's a gratin of Florence fennel...

37:27.548 --> 37:29.591
...new potatoes...

37:29.675 --> 37:31.135
.. clam and sorrel soup...

37:31.135 --> 37:32.594
.. with cream and mirepoix...

37:34.096 --> 37:36.181
.. and stuffed quail.

37:36.265 --> 37:39.184
Kate, I have a dinner tonight. Clients.

37:40.269 --> 37:41.437
Tonight?

37:45.566 --> 37:47.860
Oh, well.
It's just for fun.

37:50.738 --> 37:52.740
I'm going to the gym.
See you!

38:04.460 --> 38:06.337
- Sweetheart...
- Yeah!?

38:07.212 --> 38:08.797
Why don't you go see a movie?

39:20.828 --> 39:21.829
Stoop!

39:28.002 --> 39:30.004
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

39:30.004 --> 39:32.548
Are you all right?
Are you OK?

39:36.010 --> 39:38.554
Come on!
I'm so sorry.

39:38.554 --> 39:40.139
Come on. Hospital, hospital.

39:40.264 --> 39:43.100
"Cascade Memorial Hospital is
located at..."

39:43.100 --> 39:45.269
Can you move your toes?

39:45.310 --> 39:46.437
Voices.

39:48.397 --> 39:50.274
I hear voices.

39:50.274 --> 39:51.859
I heard voices.
Are those in my...?

39:55.446 --> 39:58.324
Hey!
You pull! You pull!

39:58.324 --> 39:59.742
You pull over and...

39:59.742 --> 40:01.493
You pull over and get out of the car.

40:01.493 --> 40:03.412
Don't need to get all huffy about it.

40:03.412 --> 40:06.165
You... you need to pull the car over...

40:06.165 --> 40:07.875
It was an accident.

40:07.875 --> 40:09.043
Listen.

40:09.126 --> 40:10.336
I will shoot you with this thing.

40:10.336 --> 40:11.879
Oh, go ahead!

40:11.920 --> 40:13.714
It will be an improvement, believe me

40:14.882 --> 40:16.342
Are you listening to me, miss?

40:16.592 --> 40:17.593
- Kate.
- Kate.

40:17.593 --> 40:18.761
I'm a desperate man.

40:18.761 --> 40:20.054
- Desperate?
- Yes.

40:20.054 --> 40:22.014
You don't know
the meaning of the word.

40:22.056 --> 40:25.351
Desperate is when you wake up in
the morning and you wish you hadn't

40:25.351 --> 40:28.187
.. it's knowing that every time
you get by in the wheel of a car...

40:28.228 --> 40:32.358
.. you're only a tree away
from ending the empty charade
that your life has become.

40:32.358 --> 40:34.360
So, don't talk to me about desperate.

40:36.236 --> 40:39.490
Listen. On second thought,
why don't you just pull over
and let me out right here.

40:39.740 --> 40:41.116
- Thank you for the lift. I'll be fine.
- No. No!

40:41.200 --> 40:42.534
I'll just walk from here.
Why?

40:42.618 --> 40:44.078
I'm feeling very fragile
at the moment.

40:44.119 --> 40:45.204
I don't think I should be alone.

40:45.329 --> 40:47.915
You're insane!

40:49.625 --> 40:51.085
I'm unhappy.

40:51.085 --> 40:53.504
It's not the same thing.

40:53.545 --> 40:56.256
Hey!
I'm a fugitive from justice.

40:56.256 --> 40:58.092
I'm a dangerous criminal.

40:58.092 --> 40:59.802
Oh. That explains the hijacking.

40:59.802 --> 41:00.803
You hit me!

41:00.928 --> 41:03.931
You can't expect to step in front of a
moving automobile and make it stop.

41:03.931 --> 41:05.974
Yes you can!
I've seen it done!

41:06.058 --> 41:07.267
Will you not yell at me!?

41:07.351 --> 41:09.353
Well, can you slow down, or
something?

41:09.395 --> 41:10.479
I wanna get out of here.

41:10.479 --> 41:12.773
I'll jump!
That's what I wanna do!

41:12.773 --> 41:14.400
How do I do to unlock this door?

41:14.400 --> 41:15.943
Push your button.
Let... let...

41:15.985 --> 41:17.111
Unlock this door!

41:17.152 --> 41:19.947
So, where you're headed?
I'll drop you.

41:19.989 --> 41:21.699
You're in no shape to drive.

41:21.782 --> 41:23.283
So, you're a fugitive, huh?

41:23.367 --> 41:26.412
- What did you rob?
- Everything.

41:26.412 --> 41:30.124
"Alert! The Global Positioning
System is rerouted! Alert! Alert!"

41:30.165 --> 41:33.669
Where is that coming from?
What is that?

41:37.798 --> 41:39.717
Between the second set of trees...

41:39.717 --> 41:41.969
.. the second set of trees, right here.

41:41.969 --> 41:45.556
I'm on fire!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

41:46.598 --> 41:48.392
Just don't ask!

41:48.434 --> 41:51.478
Look here! Yeah!

41:58.152 --> 41:59.987
What the hell is this?

42:00.029 --> 42:02.031
Kate, Paul Bunyan.
Paul, Kate.

42:02.114 --> 42:03.157
Kate?

42:03.198 --> 42:05.117
I ran out of gas.

42:05.159 --> 42:06.118
And?

42:06.118 --> 42:09.163
And she hit me. With her car.

42:09.204 --> 42:11.206
OK. She hit you with her car.

42:11.332 --> 42:12.916
What the hell did you bring her
out here for?

42:12.916 --> 42:14.752
One: I had no choice.

42:14.752 --> 42:16.879
Two: I may have suffered a slight
concussion.

42:16.879 --> 42:19.923
And three: She's mentally
unbalanced to a spectacular degree.

42:20.007 --> 42:21.133
I can hear you.

42:21.175 --> 42:24.219
I tried to escape.
She wouldn't stop.

42:24.219 --> 42:26.555
I almost jumped from the speeding
car, Joe!

42:26.555 --> 42:29.350
You hear me?
I had double vision.

42:29.350 --> 42:31.101
What was I gonna do?

42:46.450 --> 42:49.203
Your left eye is a fraction darker
than the right one.

42:50.454 --> 42:52.247
Nobody ever noticed!

42:52.373 --> 42:54.208
I'm Joe.

42:54.249 --> 42:55.793
I'm Kate.

42:58.754 --> 43:01.048
Oh! What happened to your tooth?

43:01.340 --> 43:03.217
Why don't you just go on your way,
OK?

43:03.258 --> 43:04.677
Act like you never met us...

43:04.760 --> 43:06.345
.. and send us a postcard from
Crazy County.

43:06.387 --> 43:07.513
Can I stay here?

43:07.513 --> 43:10.516
Is just that
I don't know where else to go.

43:10.557 --> 43:12.059
It will only be one night.

43:12.101 --> 43:13.352
Please?

43:13.394 --> 43:14.687
I'm not sure we can do that.

43:14.770 --> 43:17.690
Absolutely no way!
That's not possible!

43:17.815 --> 43:19.817
I can't go home.

43:19.817 --> 43:21.944
I can't.

43:21.986 --> 43:23.445
I could go to the police.

43:23.529 --> 43:27.157
I mean... What's to stop me from
leading them straight to your hideout?

43:28.117 --> 43:30.119
What are you hiding from?

43:30.119 --> 43:31.161
Anyway... I mean he didn't tell me.

43:31.161 --> 43:32.997
He's very, very discrete.

43:33.080 --> 43:34.248
Come here, Joe. Come here.

43:34.248 --> 43:35.833
What are you...?
What's with the...?

43:35.833 --> 43:38.252
- Joe, I wanna talk to you.
- What's happened?

43:38.252 --> 43:41.005
Jesus! This is a very, very bad idea.

43:41.005 --> 43:43.799
In the history of bad ideas
this is a humdinger. OK?

43:43.841 --> 43:45.134
She's right about the police.

43:45.259 --> 43:46.135
Shoot her!

43:46.260 --> 43:47.594
Bury her body in the woods!

43:47.594 --> 43:49.471
What am I?
Invisible?

43:49.555 --> 43:52.599
- She says she has no place to stay.
- It's none of our business.

43:52.599 --> 43:53.851
Well, it is now that you brought
her here, isn't it?

43:53.851 --> 43:56.020
Well, I needed a ride! OK?

43:56.020 --> 43:59.023
There I was sprawled down
on the asphalt.

44:00.524 --> 44:03.193
You know the hardest thing
about being smart?

44:03.277 --> 44:04.194
No.

44:04.278 --> 44:06.196
I always pretty much know
what's gonna happen next.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.781
There's no suspense.

44:07.865 --> 44:10.451
And don't think I didn't see
the look in your eye over there...

44:10.451 --> 44:12.703
.. and feel out a little hair
and that kind of stuff.

44:12.703 --> 44:15.748
I'm implementing
a 24 hour rule from now on. OK?

44:15.789 --> 44:17.708
It's in effect.

44:17.750 --> 44:18.792
24 hours.

44:18.876 --> 44:20.878
24 hours
and not a minute longer, missy.

44:20.878 --> 44:21.879
Thank you.

44:23.756 --> 44:25.466
Hey!
I'll cook dinner.

44:25.466 --> 44:27.468
I cook the dinners around here.

44:27.468 --> 44:29.928
Sorry. Not familiar with the
outlaw code.

44:31.138 --> 44:32.931
Does that mean I'm a hostage?

44:34.141 --> 44:35.476
Well, I was in Las Vegas.

44:35.476 --> 44:36.477
Don't get excited.

44:36.477 --> 44:38.187
I'm not talking to you.

44:38.228 --> 44:40.147
But Joe, you know the costs.

44:40.189 --> 44:42.524
Hotel remodeling, real estate.

44:42.608 --> 44:45.319
I've estimated $20,000
for the kitchen alone.

44:45.319 --> 44:47.321
I mean we're talking
about restaurant-quality here.

44:47.321 --> 44:49.323
And that's not to mention
the nightclub.

44:49.365 --> 44:52.034
You know, I've got a crippled cousin
up in New Hampshire...

44:52.034 --> 44:54.495
.. that's going in for her 7th
operation on her leg. OK?

44:54.620 --> 44:56.038
I got my mother's people
up in Ottawa...

44:56.038 --> 44:57.039
.. the aunts and the uncles...

44:57.039 --> 44:58.666
.. these bills add up Terry, OK?

44:58.666 --> 45:02.503
Listen. I'm really impressed about
any and all charitable contributions.

45:02.544 --> 45:03.545
How crippled?

45:03.629 --> 45:05.673
Did you know you could bet on
Irish hurling?

45:05.673 --> 45:08.342
Hey, hey, hey!
Excuse me, Harvey!

45:08.384 --> 45:10.803
I'm trying to figure out
why my partner here...

45:10.928 --> 45:14.765
..when he wasn't helping improve the
Blake family standard of living...

45:14.807 --> 45:17.518
.. manage to spend $200,000.

45:17.518 --> 45:20.229
I met a very lovely young lady from
the Netherlands down in San Diego...

45:20.229 --> 45:21.355
Oh! Color me surprise!

45:21.397 --> 45:23.440
.. who took me to this
Oktoberfest deal...

45:23.440 --> 45:27.236
.. and they had a big parade and she
wanted to ride on one of the floats.

45:27.236 --> 45:28.529
OK?
So, I bought her one.

45:28.529 --> 45:31.991
Now, we were drinking these big
steins of Holland beer...

45:31.991 --> 45:33.117
.. and one thing leads to another...

45:33.117 --> 45:37.287
.. and I'm throwing
$50 bills out to the crowd.

45:37.413 --> 45:40.874
The thing about Irish hurling is that
it's like football with sticks.

45:40.958 --> 45:43.419
Stop it! Stop it!
Please!

45:43.419 --> 45:47.548
For God's sake, Pollard!
OK?

45:47.840 --> 45:50.718
OK. You meet a girl,
you go to a festival...

45:50.718 --> 45:52.553
Oktoberfest.

45:52.594 --> 45:54.013
.. you throw $50 bills to the crowd...

45:54.096 --> 45:55.472
I noticed you got
a new gold watch...

45:55.556 --> 45:56.890
It's an 18 carat-gold watch.

45:56.974 --> 45:58.183
I don't give a shit
how many carats it is.

45:58.267 --> 45:59.476
$36,000. No big deal.

45:59.560 --> 46:01.395
Did you ever think
to ask someone about the time?

46:01.437 --> 46:02.396
It's a lot cheaper.

46:02.438 --> 46:04.023
Anything else?

46:04.023 --> 46:06.442
Well, yeah.
We stayed a couple of days longer...

46:06.442 --> 46:10.154
.. than I thought we're gonna,
down in San Diego, and I had to
get her back to the Netherlands...

46:10.195 --> 46:12.740
.. so I chartered a private jet
to take her home.

46:12.740 --> 46:14.575
Oh! Of course you did!

46:14.616 --> 46:16.702
- The Netherlands.
- Yeah.

46:17.036 --> 46:20.622
- Joe!
- What?

46:20.706 --> 46:21.749
Listen.

46:24.209 --> 46:25.794
Let me try
to explain something to you.

46:25.878 --> 46:29.048
Paradise doesn't come cheaply. OK?

46:29.048 --> 46:31.717
Now, I figured this
down to the last nickel.

46:31.759 --> 46:33.886
Now, and here's the important part...

46:33.927 --> 46:37.473
.. every nickel that we spend
is a nickel that we have to steal.

46:37.473 --> 46:38.891
Now, that's a lot of nickels, Joe.

46:38.891 --> 46:41.894
I don't wanna rob banks
for the rest of my life.

46:41.935 --> 46:44.897
The stress level
is just too damned high.

46:48.484 --> 46:50.361
Harvey...Joe...
Dinner's almost ready.

46:51.362 --> 46:54.073
Now, this is not bad.

46:54.114 --> 46:55.949
It's a little... Hmm...

46:56.075 --> 46:57.910
.. it's a little chewy, but...

47:08.253 --> 47:12.466
You boys, ever eat
and talk at the same time?

47:13.842 --> 47:15.219
We used to.

47:20.391 --> 47:23.519
So, what sort of work do you do?
Crime wise.

47:23.560 --> 47:25.521
Bank robbery.

47:25.521 --> 47:28.107
Well, they rob banks
and I drive the getaway car.

47:29.108 --> 47:31.568
Harvey!
That's enough, Harvey!

47:33.696 --> 47:35.239
Wait a minute.
You're not...

47:35.239 --> 47:39.118
the guys who go to the bank manager's
house the night before and...

47:39.118 --> 47:41.996
- They do. I drive the getaway car.
- Harvey!

47:43.706 --> 47:45.958
Oh, my God.

47:49.545 --> 47:51.672
You're the "Sleep-Over Bandits".

47:53.257 --> 47:55.551
Oh, my gosh,
you're practically famous.

47:55.592 --> 47:58.679
The "Sleep-Over Bandits"?

47:58.679 --> 47:59.805
That's us?

48:01.432 --> 48:03.142
Don't you watch
"Criminals at Large"?

48:03.142 --> 48:06.395
You should.
They're watching you.

48:06.437 --> 48:08.272
You're astounding, Harvey.

48:08.314 --> 48:10.316
So...

48:10.316 --> 48:13.027
.. you rob banks.
That's impressive.

48:13.027 --> 48:16.572
What? The little old ladies' saving
accounts, and cub-scout dues...

48:16.613 --> 48:18.115
... and homeless orphans'
Christmas funds?

48:18.157 --> 48:19.616
Is that what...?

48:21.785 --> 48:24.747
We never stole a penny from
anybody who earned it, lady.

48:26.498 --> 48:29.710
The money's federally ensured
by the government.

48:30.794 --> 48:33.922
The government steals money from people,
and we just take it back from them.

48:42.014 --> 48:45.351
Any more questions, Kate?

48:53.067 --> 48:55.486
Got a spare toothbrush?

48:55.486 --> 48:57.196
I didn't have the time to pack.

48:58.739 --> 49:00.783
God! Nobody could be that sick!

49:00.908 --> 49:02.076
Put that down.

49:05.079 --> 49:07.498
May I?

49:07.498 --> 49:09.083
What are you doing here?

49:09.083 --> 49:10.250
Cleaning my teeth.

49:10.376 --> 49:14.797
I mean, manic depression, delusion,
I understand all that.

49:14.797 --> 49:16.632
It's very impressive, but...

49:16.674 --> 49:18.634
Do you know how many germs
are on your finger?

49:18.676 --> 49:21.095
That kinda defeats the purpose.

49:21.136 --> 49:24.473
If you don't give me a toothbrush,
I don't have much option, do I?

49:27.351 --> 49:30.145
I don't think you're crazy at all,
you know that?

49:30.229 --> 49:31.689
I think you're bored.

49:31.689 --> 49:33.816
I think you're bored with your life...

49:33.857 --> 49:39.113
.. and you're expecting that some
miracle's gonna drop out of the sky,
and suddenly make everything better

49:39.154 --> 49:40.447
.. or at least hopeful...

49:40.531 --> 49:43.158
.. because you lost hope
a long time ago.

49:43.450 --> 49:45.244
And your marriage sucks.

49:48.539 --> 49:50.958
But, I'm sorry, Kate.
We can't help you.

49:54.253 --> 49:57.089
You don't know me.
You only think you do.

49:59.258 --> 50:00.843
You're joking.

50:00.884 --> 50:03.012
Saw it in a movie.

50:03.095 --> 50:05.014
How does it end?

50:06.265 --> 50:08.559
With a wedding.

50:17.693 --> 50:19.695
Beavers and ducks.

50:20.738 --> 50:22.781
Suckers.

50:22.781 --> 50:25.868
I'm not waiting for anything
to fall out of the sky.

50:25.909 --> 50:27.786
I'm not bored, I'm angry.

50:33.208 --> 50:35.586
Maybe I'm running out of hope.

50:35.586 --> 50:38.464
It's entirely my fault...

50:38.505 --> 50:40.716
.. cause I picked the wrong life.

50:53.354 --> 50:56.482
"The Valley spirit is a woman.

50:56.482 --> 51:00.903
"Use her root at the Gateway of
Heaven, and it will never fail."

51:01.028 --> 51:04.448
What the hell is that supposed to
mean?

51:05.658 --> 51:07.117
Not a clue.

51:08.661 --> 51:09.787
I'm hoping that it means:

51:09.828 --> 51:11.955
"Figure out what you want
and just take it."

51:12.039 --> 51:15.084
Oh, please...

51:15.125 --> 51:18.087
Well, like robbing a bank?

51:18.128 --> 51:19.672
Like that. Yeah.

51:21.215 --> 51:23.092
If only life were that simple...

51:27.346 --> 51:30.474
"Like a shadow on me
all the time."

51:33.060 --> 51:35.396
"I don't know what to do,"

51:35.396 --> 51:38.107
"I'm always in the dark."

51:38.107 --> 51:41.235
"We're living in a powder keg,
giving off sparks. "

51:49.159 --> 51:52.997
"Once upon a time,
I was falling in love."

51:52.997 --> 51:55.666
"Now, I'm only falling apart."

51:55.708 --> 51:58.544
"Nothing I can do,"

51:58.544 --> 52:00.838
"Total eclipse of the heart."

52:07.136 --> 52:10.139
"Once upon a time
there was light in my life,"

52:10.180 --> 52:13.475
"Now there's only love in the dark."

52:13.559 --> 52:15.310
"Nothing I can do,"

52:15.310 --> 52:17.313
"Total eclipse of the heart."

52:18.856 --> 52:22.901
Oh, my God.
Give me a break.

52:22.985 --> 52:26.572
"Turn around, bright eyes."

52:26.613 --> 52:29.867
I can't believe you know that song!

52:29.867 --> 52:32.036
Yeah. Bonnie Tyler.

52:32.036 --> 52:33.495
Total Eclipse of the Heart.

52:33.787 --> 52:35.914
It's the ultimate sappy chick song.

52:35.914 --> 52:37.708
- It's not a sappy chick song.
- It's very sappy chick.

52:37.750 --> 52:40.419
No, it's not. Please, don't argue
cause I've had a really hard day.

52:40.461 --> 52:42.129
This is the song that all girls...

52:42.171 --> 52:43.505
It is an epic haiku...

52:43.589 --> 52:44.506
A what?

52:44.590 --> 52:47.134
It is a haiku to the complexity of love.

52:47.176 --> 52:49.636
It's also pretty embarrassing for guys.

52:49.762 --> 52:54.058
When that song was out, I used to
listen to it on the radio...

52:54.141 --> 52:57.936
.. I have to admit I'd get a
little misty.

52:57.936 --> 52:59.480
Really?

52:59.605 --> 53:01.649
Yeah, a little.

53:01.649 --> 53:06.904
And I would appreciate it
if you don't mention that to anyone.

53:06.904 --> 53:10.240
I won't tell a soul.

53:12.368 --> 53:14.620
Thanks.

53:26.465 --> 53:27.800
It's all right.
I'll get it.

53:27.841 --> 53:29.093
Oh, I can get it.

53:29.093 --> 53:31.804
No, no. Just stay under the covers.

53:31.804 --> 53:35.349
You know another song jacked me up
when I was a kid?

53:35.391 --> 53:37.601
The song about the pony,
one five minutes long.

53:37.976 --> 53:40.813
Oh, I love that pony song!

53:40.813 --> 53:42.398
I love all pony songs.

53:42.398 --> 53:43.983
- Really?
- Yeah!

53:43.983 --> 53:46.986
It's the one that goes:
"Ride pony, ride..."

53:46.986 --> 53:49.822
That's Mustang Sally.
Close. It's a horse.

53:49.822 --> 53:51.156
Wasn't the pony called Sally?

53:51.156 --> 53:55.452
No this pony. He was called Wildfire.
He busted down the stall.

53:57.579 --> 53:59.873
They called him... Wildfire.

54:05.546 --> 54:08.882
- Joe...
- Yeah.

54:11.260 --> 54:13.554
I think I know what I want.

54:23.856 --> 54:25.441
Amazing.

54:45.044 --> 54:49.506
Joe, the 24-hour rule is all
that stands between us and chaos.

54:50.799 --> 54:53.427
Are you listening to me?

54:53.469 --> 54:56.972
We're at a crossroads here. And I want
you to be very clear about my meaning.

54:56.972 --> 54:58.807
I'm changing the 24-hour rule.
OK?

54:58.807 --> 55:00.142
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

55:00.184 --> 55:01.518
She's a missing person.

55:01.602 --> 55:04.063
Missing meaning
that someone's looking for her.

55:04.063 --> 55:05.230
You get it?

55:05.314 --> 55:07.524
I'm changing the 24-hour rule.

55:07.608 --> 55:10.069
May I help you?

55:10.069 --> 55:12.488
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're here to rob your bank.

55:16.825 --> 55:17.826
What the hell is that?

55:17.910 --> 55:22.456
It's a disorder that affects your ability
to regulate sleep and wakefulness.

55:22.498 --> 55:24.375
I thought he was dead.

55:24.458 --> 55:28.212
No, that's cataplexy.
A secondary symptom.

55:28.253 --> 55:30.964
Sudden loss
of voluntary muscle control.

55:31.048 --> 55:34.468
I just have a question.
Why now?

55:34.510 --> 55:35.969
Well, in Larry's case...

55:36.053 --> 55:38.972
.. emotional stress
is the primary igniter.

55:39.056 --> 55:42.518
Do you have a guest bedroom here,
madam?

55:46.146 --> 55:49.233
We'll ask you to start right here
in the manager's office.

55:49.274 --> 55:50.985
Go ahead.

55:51.068 --> 55:53.779
You never know what's gonna
happen during a robbery.

55:53.821 --> 55:55.406
That's the thing.

55:55.447 --> 55:57.449
There's always
a surprise of some kind...

55:57.449 --> 55:58.701
.. you know, beyond your control.

55:58.701 --> 56:03.998
But, I mean, the thing is that you
have to remain calm under pressure
and think on your feet.

56:03.998 --> 56:08.377
No, no! All that I'm saying is that it
seems a little silly falling asleep
during a bank robbery.

56:08.377 --> 56:12.381
Well, it may appear silly to you, but
there's a perfectly reasonable explanation.

56:15.718 --> 56:17.302
Done.

56:17.386 --> 56:19.430
I'm sorry.
I'm a little nervous.

56:19.430 --> 56:20.889
It's OK, Larry!

56:20.889 --> 56:23.600
Nothing to be nervous about.

56:23.684 --> 56:28.856
You see, my body chemistry is
extraordinarily sensitive to suggestion

56:28.897 --> 56:31.442
Any symptom can be manufactured,
given the right circumstances...

56:31.442 --> 56:34.278
.. and that, by the way,
doesn't mean it isn't real.

56:34.320 --> 56:37.031
Ah! Jesus!
This stuff is hot.

56:39.742 --> 56:42.328
Go get Mrs. Fife.

56:42.328 --> 56:46.165
So, I met this girl and, you know,
I wanted to impress her, so I said:

56:46.290 --> 56:48.584
"Do you wanna see me
light my hands on fire?"

56:48.625 --> 56:51.920
'Cause I bet you've never seen
anything like that before.

56:52.004 --> 56:54.048
And she said:
"Well, what about your head?"

56:54.131 --> 56:55.049
Your head?

56:55.132 --> 56:56.050
Yeah, my head.

56:56.133 --> 56:59.470
You know, I don't have the proper
gear for that stunt, at least not yet.

56:59.470 --> 57:00.804
I said: "No way!"

57:00.804 --> 57:02.931
But she wouldn't listen, you know.

57:03.015 --> 57:05.351
Flaming hands wasn't enough.

57:05.351 --> 57:07.311
She wanted to see me
set my head on fire.

57:07.353 --> 57:09.063
So, what did you do?

57:09.063 --> 57:11.065
Singed off half my hair.

57:12.107 --> 57:13.484
A little bit more, sweetheart.

57:13.484 --> 57:14.652
Here you go.

57:14.652 --> 57:15.819
Is he coming around?

57:15.903 --> 57:18.614
Because... because
we really need him to come around.

57:18.656 --> 57:19.657
He's coming... around.

57:19.740 --> 57:22.076
We really don't have that much time.
This is ridiculous.

57:23.077 --> 57:24.036
It's the emotion.

57:24.078 --> 57:25.120
A nervous breakdown here.

57:26.789 --> 57:28.248
Guys, we have a problem.

57:28.248 --> 57:31.085
We got multiple bogies
at nine o'clock.

57:33.504 --> 57:34.505
What the hell is that?

57:34.505 --> 57:36.090
It's the drive-up window.

57:36.090 --> 57:37.466
Someone's at the drive-up.

57:37.508 --> 57:38.801
At eight o'clock in the morning?

57:40.636 --> 57:42.054
- What do we do?
- Nothing.

57:42.096 --> 57:43.055
Hello.

57:44.932 --> 57:48.560
I'm telling you, if you act too eager
like that. Dottie is never gonna
give you a second look.

57:48.644 --> 57:52.106
Women do not respond to needs.

57:54.149 --> 57:56.402
It's the police.

57:59.530 --> 58:02.408
Good morning.

58:04.368 --> 58:05.577
Where's Dottie?

58:05.661 --> 58:07.162
Who?

58:07.246 --> 58:09.456
The drive-up girl.

58:09.540 --> 58:11.291
Oh, I'm sorry, Dottie. Of course.

58:11.417 --> 58:14.378
Aaah... she's sick.

58:14.378 --> 58:15.963
Sick with what?

58:16.005 --> 58:18.841
Vaginitis.

58:18.841 --> 58:21.468
She's been suffering from an
abnormal vaginal discharge.

58:21.552 --> 58:22.678
It's the common symptom.

58:22.678 --> 58:28.308
A viscous fluid usually associated
with... well, Vaginitis.

58:28.392 --> 58:29.852
It's usually associated...

58:39.737 --> 58:41.322
All clear above us.

58:41.405 --> 58:42.740
You're all right?

58:42.781 --> 58:43.741
That was great!

58:43.782 --> 58:45.993
- It's exciting, right?
- Yeah.

58:50.622 --> 58:52.499
Why a college parking lot?

58:52.583 --> 58:54.126
Well, there's lots of cars around.

58:54.209 --> 58:55.336
Even in the morning.

58:55.336 --> 58:57.463
Leave the Jaguar here.

58:57.463 --> 58:58.589
No gambling.

59:01.467 --> 59:04.053
I'll see you in Tonopah in two weeks.
You understand?

59:04.303 --> 59:06.347
- Yeah, all right. Two weeks.
- You hear me?

59:16.065 --> 59:17.316
Well, he'll get tired of her.

59:17.358 --> 59:19.360
Just takes time. You'll see.

59:19.485 --> 59:23.197
I don't know.
Kate is a special lady.

59:23.197 --> 59:25.616
Kate is an iceberg
waiting for the Titanic.

59:28.077 --> 59:29.953
Has anybody seen Kate Wheeler?

59:30.037 --> 59:33.791
Local authorities are investigating
the possible connection between the
missing woman...

59:33.791 --> 59:37.127
.. and the latest in the series of bank
robberies committed by the
"Sleep-Over Bandits".

59:37.211 --> 59:41.674
Wheeler vanished just 24 hours before
the robbery at the San Andreas bank.

59:41.674 --> 59:44.510
Her abandoned automobile was
discovered at short distance...

59:44.551 --> 59:47.137
.. from the automobile belonging to
the bank manager Lawrence Fife.

59:47.221 --> 59:50.140
But a much bigger question
remains unanswered, people.

59:50.224 --> 59:52.935
Who exactly are these mystery men?

59:52.977 --> 59:55.646
In a related development a federal
task force has been assembled...

59:55.646 --> 59:57.856
.. to try to piece together
this whole mystery.

59:57.856 --> 01:00:00.818
Is there a connection
between the missing woman
and the "Sleep-Over Bandits"?

01:00:00.859 --> 01:00:04.196
Is Kate Wheeler associated
with the "Sleep-Over Bandits"
or is she part of the gang?

01:00:04.238 --> 01:00:09.576
We'll keep you updated. Right here
as this whole story unfolds.
At "Criminals at Large".

01:00:52.286 --> 01:00:54.747
- Harvey?
- Yeah.

01:00:54.747 --> 01:00:57.166
Do you remember what I said
about conspicuous behavior?

01:00:57.207 --> 01:00:59.585
Keeping a low profile.

01:00:59.626 --> 01:01:01.128
Are you achieving that do you think?

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:02.129
You bet!

01:01:02.171 --> 01:01:04.298
Good boy.

01:01:04.298 --> 01:01:05.924
What do you think of my boots?

01:01:06.008 --> 01:01:09.178
Very lifelike.

01:01:22.941 --> 01:01:25.319
- Hey!
- 19.

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.072
We'll be right there.

01:01:28.072 --> 01:01:32.076
Just so you know,
I got a bee up my ass about you two.

01:01:33.327 --> 01:01:35.663
Congratulations, Kate.

01:01:35.663 --> 01:01:39.208
You're a famous missing person,
practically a TV star.

01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:41.335
Different for you,
bad for us.

01:01:41.377 --> 01:01:44.546
You see, we're pretty much trying
to keep ourselves out of the
spotlight whenever possible.

01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:47.132
Nobody saw me.
We barely left the room.

01:01:47.216 --> 01:01:51.220
- Go home!
- No!
- Yes! Joe!

01:01:51.345 --> 01:01:52.638
It's up to Kate.

01:01:52.638 --> 01:01:54.515
What do you mean:
"It's up to Kate"?

01:01:54.556 --> 01:01:55.808
Relax, Terry Lee.

01:01:55.808 --> 01:01:57.810
We went shopping.

01:01:57.810 --> 01:01:59.645
Bought me my first disguise.

01:01:59.687 --> 01:02:01.397
You went shopping?

01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:03.983
Yeah, we went shopping.
What's the big deal?

01:02:05.067 --> 01:02:06.151
We have a wig.

01:02:06.235 --> 01:02:07.236
We have a hat.

01:02:07.236 --> 01:02:09.822
For those long sunny days
on the land.

01:02:09.822 --> 01:02:10.990
What do you think?

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:12.408
I don't care about it.
I told you.

01:02:12.408 --> 01:02:15.452
Hey!
What happened to Kate?

01:02:15.536 --> 01:02:17.121
You made a joke?

01:02:18.163 --> 01:02:21.333
Oh, that's sweet.
They made a little love joke.

01:02:25.546 --> 01:02:27.673
So, Joe, is she worth it?

01:02:27.715 --> 01:02:31.593
I mean, in theory,
isn't one woman just like the next?

01:02:31.677 --> 01:02:33.012
So, I was just wondering...

01:02:33.012 --> 01:02:34.013
.. you know, is she worth it?

01:02:34.096 --> 01:02:36.557
She's got saliva in her mouth.

01:02:36.598 --> 01:02:37.850
Of course she's got saliva...

01:02:37.975 --> 01:02:39.143
.. everybody does. It's glandular.

01:02:39.184 --> 01:02:40.728
She's got more.

01:02:40.728 --> 01:02:42.896
Really? How much?

01:02:42.896 --> 01:02:44.189
A lot.

01:02:44.273 --> 01:02:46.567
A lot? Well, that sounds like
a sort of tumor in the gland.

01:02:46.567 --> 01:02:48.736
You know, rabies is transferred
that way, by saliva.

01:02:48.777 --> 01:02:53.407
Terry, no one has ever kissed me
like that before.

01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:55.617
Ever.

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:03.751
Law enforcement officials have finally
discovered the identities of the
"Sleep-Over Bandits".

01:03:03.751 --> 01:03:08.756
Joe Blake and Terry Collins escaped
from the Oregon State penitentiary
just three months ago.

01:03:08.756 --> 01:03:12.593
Today, for the first time ever,
Blake and Collins were added...

01:03:12.593 --> 01:03:13.719
.. to both the FBI...

01:03:13.761 --> 01:03:16.013
.. and the federal marshals
top ten Most Wanted list.

01:03:16.055 --> 01:03:19.767
And added to that
a half a million dollars reward
was offered for their capture.

01:03:19.767 --> 01:03:22.186
The identities of these modern day
Robin Hoods...

01:03:22.186 --> 01:03:25.522
.. was first confirmed by two teenage
hostages who were taken...

01:03:25.606 --> 01:03:27.483
... after the amazing prison break.

01:03:27.483 --> 01:03:29.193
Here. Here they are.

01:03:29.193 --> 01:03:30.611
Cheri Woods, wait!

01:03:31.654 --> 01:03:32.529
Please, get back.

01:03:32.613 --> 01:03:33.530
Are you hurt?

01:03:33.614 --> 01:03:35.032
What's the matter?

01:03:35.074 --> 01:03:36.367
Did they tie you up?

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:37.534
No. They were real gents.

01:03:37.618 --> 01:03:40.079
We ate pizza,
and played video games.

01:03:40.079 --> 01:03:41.080
Please, back up!

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.081
We need to talk.

01:03:42.081 --> 01:03:43.624
Did they take anything?

01:03:43.666 --> 01:03:45.084
Yeah. They took my car.

01:03:45.084 --> 01:03:46.377
They didn't do anything.

01:03:46.377 --> 01:03:47.336
They were very nice.

01:03:47.378 --> 01:03:48.629
Folks, please move back.

01:03:48.629 --> 01:03:51.632
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
so much for your cooperation.

01:03:51.674 --> 01:03:53.509
Please make no attempt to escape...

01:03:53.509 --> 01:03:56.136
.. as we will be monitoring the police
scanner and we'll kill you if you do.

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.513
Thanks again for your cooperation.

01:03:57.513 --> 01:03:58.972
Bye, Joe! Bye, Terry!

01:03:58.972 --> 01:04:01.433
That's great.
"Bye, Joe. Bye, Terry."

01:04:01.517 --> 01:04:02.643
Did you hear that?

01:04:15.239 --> 01:04:16.240
Harvey?

01:04:18.242 --> 01:04:19.118
Harvey?

01:04:19.118 --> 01:04:22.246
Harvey?!
Aren't we supposed to be following
the guys to the rendez-vous?

01:04:22.246 --> 01:04:23.706
Pink.

01:04:23.706 --> 01:04:24.707
The girl?

01:04:24.707 --> 01:04:25.958
Pink boots.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.377
Number one lesson how to get a girl:
Play hard to get.

01:04:28.377 --> 01:04:29.420
Let's go, sweetheart.

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.587
- Do you think she needs a ride?
- No.

01:04:30.587 --> 01:04:33.674
- I think she needs a ride.
- I think I need a ride. Let's go.

01:04:37.177 --> 01:04:39.263
Accelerate and go.

01:04:39.304 --> 01:04:40.556
Go.

01:05:03.704 --> 01:05:05.706
Is this the only road?

01:05:05.748 --> 01:05:06.874
Don't worry. We'll find it.

01:05:06.999 --> 01:05:09.460
You should rest your little head,
young lady.

01:05:11.503 --> 01:05:12.880
Here they are.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.173
It's OK.

01:05:14.214 --> 01:05:17.009
We got them.

01:05:22.598 --> 01:05:24.183
All righty!

01:05:34.443 --> 01:05:36.195
We thought we'd lost you.

01:05:36.195 --> 01:05:37.196
Joe!

01:05:37.321 --> 01:05:38.238
You are so cute.

01:05:38.238 --> 01:05:39.948
You are really cute.

01:05:46.747 --> 01:05:48.040
Harvey, stop...!
Harvey!

01:06:12.523 --> 01:06:15.943
Dispatch. You better call 911.
We've got a major accident here.

01:06:15.985 --> 01:06:17.861
We're probably gonna need
an ambulance.

01:06:20.155 --> 01:06:21.991
Oh, my God.

01:06:21.991 --> 01:06:25.119
I think the condition of things
is just...

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.287
I don't think they should
probably even move us.

01:06:27.413 --> 01:06:29.581
I'm not sure whether
we should be moving at all.

01:06:29.665 --> 01:06:32.376
I mean... I mean we should be like...
restrained.

01:06:40.843 --> 01:06:43.262
Are we in Scotland
with a bunch of sheep?

01:06:43.262 --> 01:06:45.681
I don't know what this is all about.
- Hey!

01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:49.852
Are you all right?

01:06:49.852 --> 01:06:51.437
I need a stabilizing collar.

01:06:51.478 --> 01:06:52.438
You probably do, too.

01:06:52.479 --> 01:06:53.439
You can't just...

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.442
We shouldn't be moving around,
and now there's sirens in my head.

01:06:56.442 --> 01:06:57.860
I probably have a concussion.

01:06:57.901 --> 01:06:59.403
- Wait!
- Do you understand?

01:06:59.403 --> 01:07:00.446
It's not in your head.

01:07:01.572 --> 01:07:02.489
Listen. Those are...

01:07:02.573 --> 01:07:03.574
You hear them, too?

01:07:03.699 --> 01:07:05.326
Yeah. It's the police.
We should go. Come on.

01:07:05.326 --> 01:07:06.327
Let's go, right now.

01:07:06.452 --> 01:07:07.453
Oh, sirens!

01:07:07.494 --> 01:07:08.996
Come on down here!
Hey!

01:07:08.996 --> 01:07:10.331
Listen. Yeah. Right.
Real sirens.

01:07:10.456 --> 01:07:11.623
You need... You need to go.

01:07:11.707 --> 01:07:12.624
Listen to me. Pay attention to me.

01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:13.709
Listen to me.

01:07:13.751 --> 01:07:15.753
Listen to me. You gotta get Kate
and get out of here. Now!

01:07:15.878 --> 01:07:17.212
I'll get the money. All right?

01:07:17.338 --> 01:07:18.714
- I'm going with you.
- No! No!

01:07:18.714 --> 01:07:20.341
If you gotta...
Go now! Go, go!

01:07:20.341 --> 01:07:21.342
Are you OK?

01:07:21.342 --> 01:07:23.218
Go with Terry and get out of here!
Now!

01:07:23.218 --> 01:07:25.054
Let's go now! Come on!

01:07:25.054 --> 01:07:26.430
Are you all right?

01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:27.473
Kate, go with Terry now!

01:07:27.514 --> 01:07:28.766
The police!

01:07:28.807 --> 01:07:29.767
I know. Kate, go with Terry now!

01:07:29.892 --> 01:07:31.894
Go! Just go on!

01:07:31.894 --> 01:07:35.189
I'll wait for you at Pollard's car.

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:37.941
Terry! That's Kate right there!
Take her!

01:07:38.025 --> 01:07:40.194
The police!

01:07:40.361 --> 01:07:41.904
The police!

01:07:44.907 --> 01:07:47.326
We can't leave them alone!

01:07:48.452 --> 01:07:50.204
Don't flail with your arms!

01:07:57.795 --> 01:07:59.213
Move! Move!

01:08:09.223 --> 01:08:12.351
Do you heat sirens? Because I still
hear sirens. Are they real or not?

01:08:12.393 --> 01:08:13.352
Calm down.

01:08:13.394 --> 01:08:14.770
Joe'll know what to do.

01:08:14.812 --> 01:08:16.854
Joe and Pollard
are long gone by now.

01:08:16.981 --> 01:08:18.983
His car is still here.

01:08:19.066 --> 01:08:20.859
Well, he can get another car.

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:22.861
As a matter of fact,
he can get another girl.

01:08:22.861 --> 01:08:24.779
He wouldn't leave without me.

01:08:26.991 --> 01:08:28.533
Kate! Memo to yourself:

01:08:28.658 --> 01:08:32.371
Joe is not exactly
the flowers and hearts kind of guy,
if you haven't noticed.

01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:38.252
And when it comes to running from
the police, you don't figure in his
thinking, or mine either. OK?

01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:40.671
Well, I'm not leaving without him.

01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:42.881
Suit yourself.

01:08:42.881 --> 01:08:45.801
Well, what are you gonna do?

01:08:45.801 --> 01:08:47.011
What am I gonna do?

01:08:47.094 --> 01:08:48.303
I'll tell you exactly
what I'm gonna do.

01:08:48.303 --> 01:08:51.307
I'm gonna flee from the scene of the
crime in the nick of time.

01:08:51.307 --> 01:08:52.433
That's what I'm gonna do.

01:08:52.433 --> 01:08:56.312
And I will give myself
a couple of weeks to get my heart
rate back to normal...

01:08:56.312 --> 01:08:58.981
.. and then, I'm gonna join Joe
at the other bank. OK?

01:08:59.023 --> 01:09:00.316
That's what I'm gonna do.

01:09:07.156 --> 01:09:09.575
Well, I'm going with you.

01:09:09.616 --> 01:09:11.201
You just stay away from me.
Forever.

01:09:11.285 --> 01:09:13.203
Please, don't make me beg.

01:10:10.969 --> 01:10:14.640
- You, are one lucky fellow.
- I am?

01:10:14.932 --> 01:10:17.101
I got the last room in town.

01:10:17.101 --> 01:10:19.395
Oh, but that won't do.
I need two rooms.

01:10:19.436 --> 01:10:20.521
No. No such thing.

01:10:20.521 --> 01:10:22.398
You see all those cars out there?

01:10:22.398 --> 01:10:24.233
It's a Debbie Day
cosmetic convention.

01:10:24.274 --> 01:10:27.111
I've never seen so much pink
in my god-damn life.

01:10:27.152 --> 01:10:28.946
It's a hell of a thing
to do to an automobile.

01:10:28.946 --> 01:10:30.864
Right. I don't care what it is.

01:10:30.948 --> 01:10:32.116
I have to have two rooms.

01:10:32.157 --> 01:10:33.993
Do you want the room, or not?

01:10:50.884 --> 01:10:52.386
Are you asleep?

01:10:52.428 --> 01:10:57.850
No. This weeble-wobble song
or whatever it is,
just scares me half to death.

01:10:57.891 --> 01:11:00.144
You?

01:11:00.144 --> 01:11:03.147
I've been thinking where Joe was.

01:11:03.147 --> 01:11:04.148
Is.

01:11:08.152 --> 01:11:10.988
Joe pretty much just likes to have a
good time and a...

01:11:10.988 --> 01:11:13.157
.. a good time, basically.

01:11:13.282 --> 01:11:14.450
Alone?

01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:15.492
Well, you know Joe.

01:11:15.576 --> 01:11:18.203
Cultural events, museums,
that kind of things.

01:11:18.203 --> 01:11:19.538
He's a very delicated traveller.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.165
He's not alone.

01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:27.296
My husband is a terrible kisser.

01:11:27.296 --> 01:11:30.174
That's random.

01:11:30.174 --> 01:11:31.508
Like how? What do you mean?

01:11:31.592 --> 01:11:35.179
Oh. The first time,
he took me to a movie...

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:37.473
.. well, he brought me home...

01:11:37.598 --> 01:11:42.186
.. and I'm standing at the front door,
you know, waiting for the inevitable...

01:11:42.186 --> 01:11:44.897
.. and... he looms.

01:11:44.897 --> 01:11:48.233
I'm saying: "OK, that's about time"
and then he...

01:11:48.317 --> 01:11:52.529
He just comes at me with his mouth
he just opened so...

01:11:52.529 --> 01:11:55.366
Oh, God! That was really wide!

01:11:56.367 --> 01:11:57.493
No. It's not funny.

01:11:57.493 --> 01:12:01.372
No. I... I actually...
I tried to adjust to the kiss size.

01:12:01.372 --> 01:12:06.335
It was huge. And I dislocated my jaw.

01:12:07.461 --> 01:12:09.213
It still clicks.

01:12:12.466 --> 01:12:14.218
You can't hear that?

01:12:14.259 --> 01:12:15.678
Kinda.

01:12:15.678 --> 01:12:17.638
Can I hear it once?

01:12:17.638 --> 01:12:19.348
It's really loud.

01:12:22.685 --> 01:12:26.647
Oh, yeah, baby!
That's, I mean, you know, it's loud.

01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:29.775
He dislocated my jaw
and I still married him.

01:12:31.443 --> 01:12:33.821
Oh, I don't know
the first thing about love.

01:12:33.821 --> 01:12:37.241
Oh, I know I look like I do,
but...

01:12:37.282 --> 01:12:39.118
.. I don't.

01:12:39.159 --> 01:12:40.995
Not really.

01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:48.460
Love is a wish
that hides in your heart...

01:12:48.544 --> 01:12:51.255
..and nobody knows about it
but you.

01:12:57.553 --> 01:12:59.430
Love is blinding...

01:13:00.848 --> 01:13:02.683
.. an eternity in a single moment...

01:13:03.726 --> 01:13:06.020
.. a religion worth dying for.

01:13:09.857 --> 01:13:12.192
Well, it's also time consuming.

01:13:14.695 --> 01:13:19.783
And, you know, a pain in the ass,
and a hole in the heart and that
sort of thing.

01:13:19.867 --> 01:13:24.413
Not necessarily in that order, but
I'd like to think it is that order, really.

01:13:29.126 --> 01:13:30.753
Oh! Bless you!

01:13:31.879 --> 01:13:35.174
Gesundheit!

01:13:36.175 --> 01:13:38.427
Many happy returns!
Oh, gosh!

01:13:38.469 --> 01:13:39.887
Oh, this is gonna be one of those.

01:13:39.887 --> 01:13:40.888
Really?

01:13:41.889 --> 01:13:43.474
Do you...?

01:13:43.474 --> 01:13:44.642
Hey, hey!
Do you want me...

01:13:44.642 --> 01:13:46.185
Do you want me to scare you?

01:13:46.226 --> 01:13:49.188
No. That's for... Isn't that for...
There's someth..

01:13:49.188 --> 01:13:49.521
Oh, no, no. Hah!

01:13:49.521 --> 01:13:51.106
- No! Don't! That's not...
- OK...

01:13:54.485 --> 01:13:55.486
Now, don't frightened!

01:13:55.486 --> 01:13:56.487
What are you doing to me?

01:13:56.487 --> 01:13:59.948
- I'm just trying to block the flow!
- You're not helping!

01:14:00.074 --> 01:14:02.326
Oh! Gees!

01:14:02.326 --> 01:14:03.786
I'm sorry.

01:14:08.666 --> 01:14:10.042
Did I scare you?

01:14:11.377 --> 01:14:14.546
I'm sorry.
A little bit hard there but...

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:17.675
.. you're dribbling a bit
but you're not sneezing.

01:14:22.638 --> 01:14:25.516
I have food allergies.

01:14:25.516 --> 01:14:26.767
Tell me about it.

01:14:26.809 --> 01:14:28.811
And... and another phobias.

01:14:28.811 --> 01:14:29.979
Like what?

01:14:30.104 --> 01:14:34.358
Like descrophobia...
which is like...

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.401
What's that?

01:14:35.401 --> 01:14:36.402
Well, I was in high school...

01:14:36.402 --> 01:14:38.070
.. It's the fear of getting smaller.

01:14:38.112 --> 01:14:40.364
I lost two inches in six months.

01:14:40.364 --> 01:14:41.699
I mean, that's quite significant...

01:14:41.699 --> 01:14:42.950
Terry, you're still here.

01:14:42.992 --> 01:14:45.536
And antique furniture
scare me half to death.

01:14:45.536 --> 01:14:46.704
What's that called?

01:14:46.787 --> 01:14:49.164
I don't think there's a name for it.
I believe I'm the only one.

01:14:49.164 --> 01:14:52.835
Oh, no, no, no! Anything before 1950
just gives me the heebie-jeebies.

01:14:52.876 --> 01:14:54.837
Benjamin Disraeli's hair...

01:14:54.878 --> 01:14:55.838
.. there's a problem with that.

01:14:55.963 --> 01:14:57.840
I'm afraid of Charles Loughton,
actually.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.258
Black and white movies.

01:14:59.383 --> 01:15:00.426
Black and white movies?

01:15:00.426 --> 01:15:02.094
I just can't eat in front of them.

01:15:02.136 --> 01:15:03.387
Oh, my God! I can't either!

01:15:04.596 --> 01:15:05.556
You know what?

01:15:05.597 --> 01:15:10.019
I think it’s better to feel too much
than to feel too little.

01:15:12.104 --> 01:15:14.440
I never thought of it that way, but...

01:15:16.025 --> 01:15:18.694
Oh, no! You're blinking again.

01:15:18.736 --> 01:15:21.613
- That's just a ventromedial anomaly.
- Can I just...

01:15:21.613 --> 01:15:24.199
May be right. Is that OK?

01:15:24.283 --> 01:15:27.161
You see, there's this neural factory
between the eyes...

01:15:27.202 --> 01:15:28.162
Between the eyes?

01:15:28.203 --> 01:15:29.163
It's right in there.

01:15:29.204 --> 01:15:30.164
Exactly.

01:15:34.585 --> 01:15:35.627
Yeah, I can f... feel it.

01:15:35.753 --> 01:15:38.213
That kind of things.

01:15:38.213 --> 01:15:40.591
You know, outgoing messages
to the nervous system.

01:15:40.632 --> 01:15:42.634
That kind of thing.
It's a...

01:15:44.637 --> 01:15:46.305
.. embarrassment, fear...

01:15:46.347 --> 01:15:50.059
It's... big, you know.

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.436
.. love and hate.

01:15:52.478 --> 01:15:54.021
That's a biggie.

01:16:03.364 --> 01:16:05.366
Oh, my God!

01:16:28.514 --> 01:16:32.643
There's this scientist, in London,
who used electric shocks...

01:16:32.685 --> 01:16:35.437
.. to prove that
cockroaches have feelings.

01:16:35.521 --> 01:16:37.982
Terry, you're not a cockroach.

01:16:38.065 --> 01:16:41.276
You're more like a...
.. more like a beaver.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.861
A beaver?

01:16:42.861 --> 01:16:44.238
In a good way.

01:16:46.156 --> 01:16:47.533
A cute one.

01:16:52.246 --> 01:16:53.706
I feel like a cockroach.

01:16:53.706 --> 01:16:57.126
I mean, that's assuming that
cockroaches are capable of making
mistakes...

01:16:57.251 --> 01:17:00.295
.. and blow apart the world
they live in.

01:17:00.295 --> 01:17:05.718
Well, if you're a cockroach
what does that make me?

01:17:07.177 --> 01:17:08.679
Dangerous.

01:17:44.465 --> 01:17:45.507
They're here.

01:17:51.221 --> 01:17:54.433
We have been wondering
about you two, guys.

01:17:54.475 --> 01:17:55.434
We were wondering...

01:17:55.476 --> 01:17:59.355
... and wondering, and wondering.
Hey, Joe!

01:18:16.538 --> 01:18:17.790
Hi.

01:18:24.797 --> 01:18:26.215
Welcome back.

01:18:30.678 --> 01:18:31.971
Missed you.

01:18:31.971 --> 01:18:36.058
Yeah.
We missed you, too.

01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:43.857
Joe, can I talk to you,
for a minute, in private?

01:18:45.234 --> 01:18:46.276
Be right back.

01:18:51.991 --> 01:18:54.827
'Cause God knows, it was a shock
to me.

01:18:54.868 --> 01:18:59.707
It was more like a... like a revelation
of some kind. And yet shocking.

01:18:59.707 --> 01:19:00.958
Like a shocking revelation.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.128
I was right about Kate's kisses,
wasn't I?

01:19:05.671 --> 01:19:08.257
Let me keep her. OK?

01:19:08.257 --> 01:19:09.717
I mean, even if you kill me...

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:10.551
.. I don't give shit.

01:19:10.592 --> 01:19:15.597
I just want to know what it feels like to
have her to myself, before I die. OK?

01:19:15.597 --> 01:19:17.308
I'm not gonna do that!
I can't do that!

01:19:17.391 --> 01:19:18.475
Why, Joe?

01:19:18.559 --> 01:19:21.437
I mean, remember,
this is like a hobby to you.

01:19:21.437 --> 01:19:22.855
It happens to you all the time.

01:19:22.896 --> 01:19:23.856
It sort of... makes you...

01:19:23.897 --> 01:19:25.858
.. makes you feel
like a million bucks.

01:19:25.858 --> 01:19:26.859
No way!

01:19:26.859 --> 01:19:27.860
But it never happens for me!

01:19:27.985 --> 01:19:29.320
Not once, Joe!

01:19:29.403 --> 01:19:31.447
Not once does this ever
happen for me.

01:19:31.447 --> 01:19:34.116
Do you understand
the significance of that?

01:19:36.577 --> 01:19:37.995
Yeah.

01:19:38.996 --> 01:19:39.997
You do?

01:19:40.706 --> 01:19:41.623
So, we agree?

01:19:41.707 --> 01:19:42.624
Let Kate choose, right?

01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:44.043
No, no, no! Of course not!

01:19:44.043 --> 01:19:45.127
That's a terrible idea!
It's a horrible idea!

01:19:45.127 --> 01:19:46.128
What's wrong with it?

01:19:46.128 --> 01:19:47.338
Because she'll choose you.

01:19:47.338 --> 01:19:50.466
Are you boys sure
you don't wanna kick my tires first?

01:19:52.801 --> 01:19:54.178
We could all wrestle.

01:19:54.219 --> 01:19:56.055
Oh, that's... yeah!?

01:19:56.055 --> 01:19:58.349
Or, I don't know. Flip a coin?

01:19:58.349 --> 01:20:00.309
You know, for this is best 4 out of 7...

01:20:00.309 --> 01:20:04.647
Unless you think that these are
incredibly shallow solutions...

01:20:04.647 --> 01:20:09.193
.. to a complicated problem that
may require a little delicacy and
understanding?

01:20:10.944 --> 01:20:14.907
Yeah, that... the last part.

01:20:18.077 --> 01:20:19.328
Maybe you're right, Kate.

01:20:19.328 --> 01:20:20.913
You should choose.

01:20:20.954 --> 01:20:22.373
So, choose.

01:20:22.373 --> 01:20:24.375
What's it gonna be?

01:20:24.375 --> 01:20:27.211
Is it gonna be mister "action figure",
hero guy here...

01:20:27.252 --> 01:20:32.508
.. or brains, and sensitivity,
and a lot of other things I can name.

01:20:32.549 --> 01:20:34.677
So, in other words, me or that guy?

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:35.844
Yeah.

01:20:35.970 --> 01:20:37.763
Good looking, or itchy?

01:20:37.805 --> 01:20:41.058
What if I don't want to?

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.267
Don't wanna what?

01:20:42.351 --> 01:20:44.395
Choose.

01:20:44.436 --> 01:20:46.105
But you have to choose.

01:20:46.105 --> 01:20:47.523
What are you talking about?

01:20:47.564 --> 01:20:49.525
Exactly that's the point, right?

01:20:49.525 --> 01:20:51.235
I know this is confusing.

01:20:51.276 --> 01:20:52.236
I mean, believe me...

01:20:52.277 --> 01:20:55.698
.. I'm a little confused myself.

01:20:55.823 --> 01:20:58.242
You stole my girl?

01:20:58.283 --> 01:21:02.538
You take her away for two weeks
and you brainwashed her.
Brainwashed.

01:21:02.538 --> 01:21:03.580
I'm not stolen.

01:21:05.457 --> 01:21:06.834
Would you stop it?

01:21:06.875 --> 01:21:08.836
Stop it! Excuse me!

01:21:08.836 --> 01:21:10.379
Would you stop this?

01:21:10.379 --> 01:21:12.131
You're getting his coat dirty!

01:21:12.131 --> 01:21:14.174
Coat?

01:21:14.258 --> 01:21:16.010
I mean, look at me!
Hello?

01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:18.429
Would you look at me,
just for a second?

01:21:18.429 --> 01:21:20.889
I ran away with bank robbers.

01:21:20.889 --> 01:21:24.351
Now, that's a... that's a strange
choice but that's understandable
giving my state my mind.

01:21:24.351 --> 01:21:25.853
But then, what did I do?

01:21:25.853 --> 01:21:29.440
I sleep with bank robber no. 1.
Because he's strong...

01:21:31.275 --> 01:21:34.570
.. and he's handsome
and he knows what he wants.

01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:36.739
Here you go. Makes sense for me.

01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:37.740
But, I don't stop there.

01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:39.616
Oh, no! Not this little red head!

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:42.411
Due to circumstances beyond the
boundaries of any life I ever known...

01:21:42.453 --> 01:21:45.122
.. I sleep with bank robber no. 2...

01:21:46.749 --> 01:21:48.709
.. and he is sweet...

01:21:50.169 --> 01:21:51.420
.. and smart, and... and...

01:21:51.462 --> 01:21:52.588
Cute as a beaver.

01:21:52.588 --> 01:21:55.007
Yeah. And he deserves more
than he thinks he does.

01:21:55.049 --> 01:21:56.467
Exactly.

01:21:56.467 --> 01:22:03.223
Now, the heart is a mysterious organ,
and it, plays by its own rules.

01:22:03.307 --> 01:22:05.059
I don't wanna choose.

01:22:05.059 --> 01:22:07.227
You know, I don't think I can...

01:22:07.227 --> 01:22:11.357
..and... if that's scary or
against the laws of...

01:22:11.357 --> 01:22:13.901
.. men, or whatever, then...

01:22:15.486 --> 01:22:18.155
I mean, you're outlaws, right?

01:22:18.656 --> 01:22:20.032
So...

01:22:21.492 --> 01:22:23.827
.. I guess I'm an outlaw, too.

01:22:27.665 --> 01:22:30.959
Ok, so Harvey, you should park,
in this alley right here,
toward this end, see?

01:22:31.085 --> 01:22:32.086
By the corner of this building.

01:22:32.086 --> 01:22:33.045
And you're hidden by the building.

01:22:33.087 --> 01:22:34.046
There's a door right here...

01:22:34.088 --> 01:22:35.047
".. and I look up, and..."

01:22:35.089 --> 01:22:40.177
".. I see these two cars headed,
you know, right by each other..."

01:22:40.219 --> 01:22:41.679
".. and they collide, right?"

01:22:41.679 --> 01:22:47.267
"And there's this red-headed woman
that's there and, and she's getting
hauled off into the other car."

01:22:47.351 --> 01:22:51.230
"The Novato - California teenager
had no way of knowing that he was
about to capture..."

01:22:51.355 --> 01:22:54.692
".. the stunning footage of the
Sleep-Over Bandits and the missing
woman, Kate Wheeler."

01:22:54.775 --> 01:22:59.279
"In this Criminals at Large exclusive
the missing woman's husband
taped a plea to the men..."

01:22:59.363 --> 01:23:00.948
".. who hold his wife hostage."

01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:02.449
"Please..."

01:23:02.533 --> 01:23:07.538
".. wherever you are...
return my wife to me."

01:23:07.538 --> 01:23:10.874
"Kate, if you're listening,
I want you to know that..."

01:23:12.459 --> 01:23:13.544
".. I'm OK."

01:23:13.544 --> 01:23:14.878
" I hope you're holding up well..."

01:23:14.878 --> 01:23:16.880
".. I hope these gentlemen are
treating you correctly..."

01:23:17.006 --> 01:23:19.675
".. in the way you should be treated,
and..."

01:23:19.717 --> 01:23:23.429
".. speaking of which I... I'm going
to Spain next week, so..."

01:23:23.429 --> 01:23:28.267
".. if your kidnappers
would like to contact me..."

01:23:28.309 --> 01:23:30.019
".. they can get in touch
with my people..."

01:23:30.019 --> 01:23:32.438
".. you know who they are, and..."

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:38.027
".. the house is waiting for you right
here... where... where you belong."

01:23:38.027 --> 01:23:39.778
"And..."

01:23:39.778 --> 01:23:42.197
".. the house misses you,
miss you..."

01:23:44.616 --> 01:23:46.910
He has no idea where I belong.

01:23:50.581 --> 01:23:51.874
You belong here.

01:23:54.418 --> 01:23:55.711
Yeah, with us.

01:24:34.917 --> 01:24:36.752
What a beautiful sunset.

01:24:36.752 --> 01:24:38.128
- It's Paradise!
- Yeah.

01:24:38.212 --> 01:24:41.382
We'll buy the restaurant,
turn it into a nightclub and resort...

01:24:41.382 --> 01:24:42.007
A nightclub?

01:24:42.132 --> 01:24:43.842
Yep.

01:24:43.968 --> 01:24:46.845
And Joe will work the room
and I'll run the kitchen, naturally...

01:24:46.845 --> 01:24:48.472
and have a spa or something like that.

01:24:48.472 --> 01:24:50.641
What does a lady like me
do in Paradise?

01:24:52.101 --> 01:24:53.352
Don't be rude!

01:24:53.352 --> 01:24:55.229
You can do whatever you want.

01:24:55.896 --> 01:24:56.897
Whatever I want?

01:24:56.897 --> 01:24:58.816
Drink margaritas,
get your toes painted...

01:24:58.857 --> 01:25:01.443
You pick it. What would you say if you
could do anything, what would it be?

01:25:01.527 --> 01:25:02.444
Whatever I want?

01:25:02.444 --> 01:25:04.238
Yeah. Whatever you want.

01:25:04.279 --> 01:25:06.156
All right.

01:25:06.156 --> 01:25:09.076
I wanna sing.

01:25:09.118 --> 01:25:10.160
Sing?

01:25:10.244 --> 01:25:11.328
Well, we need a singer.

01:25:11.328 --> 01:25:13.455
We need a singer for the nightclub.
We talked about that.

01:25:13.539 --> 01:25:14.832
We talked about that, yeah.

01:25:14.957 --> 01:25:16.000
Do you wanna...?

01:25:16.125 --> 01:25:17.584
- Do you wanna sing right now?
- You want me to sing for you?

01:25:17.584 --> 01:25:19.044
- Come on!
- OK!

01:25:19.044 --> 01:25:20.546
There it is!

01:25:20.587 --> 01:25:21.839
All right! Come on.

01:25:23.424 --> 01:25:25.009
OK. Oldie, but a goodie.

01:26:16.769 --> 01:26:18.187
How are you feeling?

01:26:18.187 --> 01:26:20.397
Well, my system's been
a flurry of activity.

01:26:20.397 --> 01:26:22.733
First I had a high rate of heart
beat, seeing spots,...

01:26:22.733 --> 01:26:24.026
.. had a prickly sensation
in my feet,

01:26:24.026 --> 01:26:26.236
then there's a sudden hearing loss
in one ear.

01:26:26.236 --> 01:26:27.780
Oh. That's not what I mean.

01:26:31.742 --> 01:26:37.206
Kate, there are guys who leave and
there are guys who get left.

01:26:37.247 --> 01:26:40.793
I don't think it's any mystery as to
which category I fall into.

01:26:40.918 --> 01:26:43.796
Terry Lee, I'm not leaving you.

01:26:45.255 --> 01:26:47.967
- Are you staying?
- Yeah.

01:26:51.428 --> 01:26:52.513
Good night.

01:26:52.513 --> 01:26:53.514
Good night?

01:26:53.514 --> 01:26:54.640
That's not staying, that's going.

01:26:54.682 --> 01:26:55.808
Where are you going?

01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:13.075
Did I get the secret knock right?

01:27:13.117 --> 01:27:16.120
Yeah. It was perfect.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.707
I really missed you
when you were away.

01:27:29.717 --> 01:27:32.011
Good night.

01:28:02.583 --> 01:28:07.338
Hey! If you wanna talk
about headaches, my brother Albert
had horrible headaches.

01:28:07.421 --> 01:28:08.339
Migraines?

01:28:08.339 --> 01:28:09.632
No! Brain tumor.

01:28:09.757 --> 01:28:12.217
He smelt burning feathers
for a whole year.

01:28:12.217 --> 01:28:13.177
You're joking.

01:28:13.218 --> 01:28:17.056
No. Some of the tumor was pressing
on some gland or something
above the nerve...

01:28:17.097 --> 01:28:18.182
Olfactive gland.

01:28:18.182 --> 01:28:19.516
Olfactive gland, yes.

01:28:19.516 --> 01:28:22.561
And, apparently, affected
his sense of smell.

01:28:22.603 --> 01:28:24.021
- But burning feathers?
- Yes

01:28:24.063 --> 01:28:25.439
- Explain that.
- Weird, isn't it?

01:28:25.439 --> 01:28:26.523
Did he smell them all the time?

01:28:26.649 --> 01:28:28.067
All the time. 24 hours a day.

01:28:28.108 --> 01:28:30.194
Burning feathers.
Great.

01:28:30.319 --> 01:28:31.320
Were there any other symptoms?

01:28:33.489 --> 01:28:35.783
Goddamn! I knew it!

01:28:35.783 --> 01:28:39.078
You're the boys from TV, the...
the Sleep-Over Bandits.

01:28:39.078 --> 01:28:40.537
I guess that means I'm a hostage.

01:28:40.663 --> 01:28:42.081
Oh, you'd better come on in.

01:28:42.081 --> 01:28:44.249
We gotta get started.
Come on! Come on!

01:28:46.251 --> 01:28:47.753
Jesus!

01:28:47.836 --> 01:28:50.214
Could you do me a favor?

01:28:50.214 --> 01:28:53.217
Could you look at my pupils
and tell me if they're the same?

01:28:53.217 --> 01:28:55.511
Are they different sizes
or are they the same?

01:28:55.511 --> 01:28:57.054
I'm not a doctor!

01:28:57.096 --> 01:28:58.389
Please, humor me.

01:29:00.641 --> 01:29:02.142
Well, the right one looks smaller.

01:29:02.226 --> 01:29:03.811
Jesus Christ! Don't tell me that!

01:29:03.852 --> 01:29:04.979
You asked.

01:29:04.979 --> 01:29:06.438
Do you smell burning feathers?

01:29:06.438 --> 01:29:07.982
No.

01:29:08.065 --> 01:29:09.858
Brain tumor.
I know I do.

01:29:09.942 --> 01:29:10.859
What?

01:29:10.943 --> 01:29:13.070
The guy there told me
my pupils are different sizes.

01:29:13.112 --> 01:29:14.822
- You're kidding me?
- No.

01:29:14.863 --> 01:29:16.073
Jesus!

01:29:16.073 --> 01:29:17.533
First, my brother, and now you?

01:29:18.701 --> 01:29:20.119
God!

01:29:29.253 --> 01:29:30.254
Pink.

01:29:31.422 --> 01:29:33.841
Harvey! Harvey!

01:29:42.308 --> 01:29:43.559
What do you mean: "No?"

01:29:43.559 --> 01:29:45.102
That's what I said: "No!"

01:29:45.102 --> 01:29:48.314
Good manners are no excuse for
criminal behavior.

01:29:48.314 --> 01:29:50.441
I am not opening the safe...

01:29:50.566 --> 01:29:52.609
.. I am not giving you the money.

01:29:52.776 --> 01:29:54.278
You know we're armed, right?

01:29:54.278 --> 01:29:57.031
Oh! You wouldn't hurt a flea, Joe.

01:29:57.031 --> 01:29:58.198
Everybody knows that.

01:29:58.198 --> 01:30:01.201
I'm stumped.
How about you?

01:30:06.749 --> 01:30:08.334
Shit.

01:30:16.759 --> 01:30:18.052
Just give us a little bit of the money.

01:30:18.052 --> 01:30:20.054
Be reasonable.
$100,000 of it is already...

01:30:20.054 --> 01:30:21.639
.. is... ensured by the
government.

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.190
Hey! Get back there!

01:30:31.190 --> 01:30:32.191
Come on! Just get back there!

01:30:32.191 --> 01:30:34.151
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- It's my bank.

01:30:34.318 --> 01:30:36.528
I guess
there's a good reason for this.

01:30:36.528 --> 01:30:39.281
Oh! The missing woman!
I almost forgot!

01:30:39.365 --> 01:30:40.324
There's police outside.

01:30:40.366 --> 01:30:42.034
- Where's Harvey?
- I don't know!

01:30:42.034 --> 01:30:43.494
Will you get back there, please?
Ma'am?

01:30:43.494 --> 01:30:45.537
Look! There's a policeman!
Right there!

01:30:45.621 --> 01:30:47.039
Do you know where the bathroom is?

01:30:47.081 --> 01:30:48.666
It's in the back there.
I hope there's clean towels.

01:30:48.666 --> 01:30:50.542
I can't believe this!

01:30:56.632 --> 01:30:58.634
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Kronenberg.

01:30:58.717 --> 01:31:02.388
But it's after 8 o'clock, and
you haven't turned the sign on yet.

01:31:02.429 --> 01:31:04.640
And I figured you maybe just forgot
the "All clear" again.

01:31:04.765 --> 01:31:06.642
Ah, Edgar. Aren't you sweet!

01:31:06.767 --> 01:31:07.851
I'll get right on it.

01:31:07.851 --> 01:31:11.063
Ah, say.. you know...
I was wondering...

01:31:11.063 --> 01:31:15.401
I sure could use some cash, and...
since I'm here...

01:31:15.401 --> 01:31:18.362
Oh, sure!
Since you're here...

01:31:18.404 --> 01:31:20.239
Come in, officer.

01:31:20.239 --> 01:31:23.492
- Right this way.
- Thanks.

01:31:33.419 --> 01:31:35.963
Hello.

01:31:35.963 --> 01:31:37.548
50 bucks OK?

01:31:37.589 --> 01:31:38.882
You've been very successful.

01:31:39.383 --> 01:31:42.553
- What do you attribute that to?
- Courage. It takes a lot of that.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.263
This is 500!

01:31:44.305 --> 01:31:45.889
These are hundreds.

01:31:46.015 --> 01:31:48.600
Oh, bank error in your favor.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:51.478
Game board kind of joke thing...

01:31:51.478 --> 01:31:52.604
Surprise.

01:31:52.730 --> 01:31:54.023
It's funny...

01:31:54.023 --> 01:31:56.442
I think I've seen you
some place before.

01:31:56.442 --> 01:31:58.444
It's my face.
You know, I have an average face.

01:31:58.444 --> 01:32:01.488
You know how people think...
you look like every man.

01:32:02.865 --> 01:32:05.409
I don't know.
Thanks, Mrs. Kronenberg.

01:32:05.451 --> 01:32:06.618
Have a good day.

01:32:11.498 --> 01:32:12.499
All right.

01:32:12.541 --> 01:32:14.460
Wait, wait, wait!
I forgot my glasses.

01:32:14.501 --> 01:32:15.627
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

01:32:15.711 --> 01:32:16.712
Shit!

01:32:20.591 --> 01:32:21.884
Come on!

01:32:21.884 --> 01:32:22.801
What?

01:32:22.885 --> 01:32:25.012
- Terry has the keys.
- Harvey!

01:32:25.596 --> 01:32:28.057
Come on! Come on!
Get in the cop's car!

01:32:29.892 --> 01:32:31.810
Where are they?
Mildred, where are they?

01:32:31.894 --> 01:32:33.479
I think that way!

01:32:33.479 --> 01:32:36.231
Or it might have been that way...
They're outside. Yes.

01:32:38.525 --> 01:32:39.652
Stop. Stop!

01:32:39.693 --> 01:32:41.904
Stop the car! Police emergency!

01:32:41.904 --> 01:32:43.364
There's a crook in that police car!
Look!

01:32:44.073 --> 01:32:46.533
Go after that crook!
Come on! Come on!

01:32:46.617 --> 01:32:47.993
We can't just leave him there!

01:32:48.035 --> 01:32:49.495
There's nothing we can do for him,
now!

01:32:49.578 --> 01:32:52.706
- We'd go back for you, if we had to!
- Don't be so sure about that!

01:32:52.748 --> 01:32:55.125
Joe, this is Terry we're talking about.

01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:56.502
Remember your friend, Terry?

01:33:07.513 --> 01:33:08.764
That's it! That's them!

01:33:08.806 --> 01:33:10.057
We found Pollard.

01:33:10.099 --> 01:33:12.643
You know Darren, I mean,
I gotta be honest with you.

01:33:12.768 --> 01:33:14.061
It's not that difficult.

01:33:14.103 --> 01:33:16.230
You walk in, you ask for the money,
you walk out.

01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:21.443
Listen! I don't wanna rush you!
But this would probably be a good
time to make your getaway.

01:33:21.527 --> 01:33:22.528
Let's go! Come on!

01:33:24.071 --> 01:33:27.408
Get away! Get away!
Let's go! Let's go! Put that down!

01:33:27.449 --> 01:33:29.243
Come on! Go!

01:33:29.284 --> 01:33:30.786
We're sorry! It's only cash...

01:33:30.828 --> 01:33:32.413
Thank you!

01:33:32.413 --> 01:33:34.081
Drive carefully!

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.003
Come on, let's go!

01:33:52.391 --> 01:33:53.434
Dispatch! This is Lincoln 6!

01:33:53.434 --> 01:33:54.435
We have an armed robber...

01:34:13.162 --> 01:34:14.788
Is it not enough that every cop
in the Western States...

01:34:14.872 --> 01:34:19.001
.. along with every mouth breathing
reporter is on our ass?

01:34:19.001 --> 01:34:20.628
You have to sabotage us
from within?

01:34:20.711 --> 01:34:21.754
I didn't do it on purpose.

01:34:21.795 --> 01:34:23.756
That's not the point.

01:34:23.881 --> 01:34:27.760
The point is you're dangerous
and you're dense and you're stupid!

01:34:27.885 --> 01:34:28.802
You're fired!

01:34:28.802 --> 01:34:30.054
No way!
I quit!

01:34:30.095 --> 01:34:31.472
- Harvey.
- Call it what you want!

01:34:31.597 --> 01:34:33.098
He's right, you know?

01:34:33.182 --> 01:34:36.352
I'm not a bank robber.
I'm a stunt man.

01:34:36.435 --> 01:34:38.729
Besides, you don't need me!
You got  Kate!

01:34:38.771 --> 01:34:40.814
Are you sure?

01:34:41.899 --> 01:34:45.194
Yeah...
I quit.

01:34:47.071 --> 01:34:49.490
You could have put us back in jail,
Harvey!

01:34:50.532 --> 01:34:52.034
I'm sorry, Joe!

01:34:58.916 --> 01:35:01.210
Maybe I'll see you guys in Mexico.

01:35:48.841 --> 01:35:51.427
Nice car.

01:35:51.552 --> 01:35:54.722
It's not mine. I stole it.

01:35:54.847 --> 01:35:57.266
What are you gonna do now?

01:35:57.308 --> 01:35:59.435
Drive to Hollywood.

01:35:59.435 --> 01:36:00.853
Yeah? Why?

01:36:00.853 --> 01:36:04.315
I'm a stunt man.

01:36:09.194 --> 01:36:10.612
Do you wanna come with me?

01:36:12.614 --> 01:36:13.615
No.

01:36:41.352 --> 01:36:43.103
- Hey, Terry?
- Yeah.

01:36:43.437 --> 01:36:47.316
Remember what I told you about my
brother? The one with a brain tumor?

01:36:47.358 --> 01:36:49.234
.. who was always smelling
burning feathers?

01:36:49.234 --> 01:36:52.321
It's emblazoned on my brain forever.

01:36:52.363 --> 01:36:53.947
You know, he never quit.

01:36:55.783 --> 01:36:58.452
Never gave up trying
right to the very end.

01:36:58.661 --> 01:37:02.956
Hey, Joe!
I know just how he feels.

01:37:06.085 --> 01:37:07.503
Good night, Joe.

01:37:07.670 --> 01:37:08.963
You guys, you guys...

01:37:08.963 --> 01:37:11.757
.. I mean you've been together for
quite a while.

01:37:11.799 --> 01:37:13.759
Do you consider yourselves
good friends, still?

01:37:13.842 --> 01:37:15.302
Oh sure. Absolutely.

01:37:15.386 --> 01:37:17.471
People say there's no honor
among thieves.

01:37:17.471 --> 01:37:19.264
- Totally wrong, right Joe?
- Totally wrong!

01:37:19.556 --> 01:37:23.102
Darren, it's like...
Lewis and Clark.

01:37:23.143 --> 01:37:24.520
You got Lewis...

01:37:24.645 --> 01:37:28.273
..he's stuck somewhere out there
in Africa...

01:37:28.273 --> 01:37:30.150
.. lost in the African wilderness.

01:37:30.234 --> 01:37:34.071
And Clark...

01:37:34.071 --> 01:37:35.990
Al Clark, I think his name was...

01:37:36.073 --> 01:37:39.159
.. he drops what he's doing
and goes to find him!

01:37:39.243 --> 01:37:41.120
He goes to find Lewis.
And you know why?

01:37:41.161 --> 01:37:43.080
Because of friendship. That's why!

01:37:44.832 --> 01:37:46.000
For God's sake, Joe...

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.418
That was Stanley and Livingston.

01:37:47.543 --> 01:37:48.460
Not Lewis and Clark.

01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:51.255
You know, Lewis and Clark tried to find
the North-West passage...

01:37:51.255 --> 01:37:53.424
..with the help of this statuesque
Indian maiden.

01:37:54.425 --> 01:37:55.843
- But they were friends, OK?
- Of course they were.

01:37:55.843 --> 01:37:57.553
He was asking us about friendship.

01:37:57.553 --> 01:37:59.096
You always got to correct me.

01:37:59.138 --> 01:38:00.723
I'm sorry. You're right.

01:38:00.723 --> 01:38:01.682
You're up!

01:38:01.765 --> 01:38:03.183
I couldn't sleep.

01:38:03.267 --> 01:38:05.269
I was thinking maybe that you and I
could go to this place...

01:38:05.269 --> 01:38:06.270
Where's Joe?

01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:07.938
He's asleep.
Sound asleep.

01:38:07.938 --> 01:38:10.232
- Terry?
- He is. He's sound asleep.

01:38:10.316 --> 01:38:14.278
If we could maybe come down to
this... bar down here...

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:18.115
.. and maybe just sit there and have a
nightcap or something.

01:38:18.157 --> 01:38:19.575
It's a little late, don't you think?

01:38:19.575 --> 01:38:21.118
Oh, no! Gosh! Not at all!

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.579
He'll live. You know?

01:38:23.704 --> 01:38:27.333
Act like it's the last most
important thing you'll ever do
in your life.

01:38:27.333 --> 01:38:28.334
Please?

01:38:28.334 --> 01:38:30.753
- All right. I'll just get a coat.
- OK.

01:38:52.483 --> 01:38:54.485
I love this song.

01:38:54.485 --> 01:38:58.238
Actually, I never heard it before.

01:38:58.322 --> 01:39:00.532
I have to press A1 on these things.

01:39:00.658 --> 01:39:02.201
It's an obsessive-compulsive thing.

01:39:02.201 --> 01:39:03.494
It's a pretty song, though.

01:39:03.494 --> 01:39:04.787
I played it 6 times.

01:39:10.834 --> 01:39:13.754
Just run away with me, Kate, please!

01:39:15.339 --> 01:39:20.094
Just get in the car and we'll just
drive, and drive, and drive...

01:39:20.094 --> 01:39:23.639
And then we'll stop at the perfect
place, and we'll stay there for as long
as we want to...

01:39:23.681 --> 01:39:26.225
.. and then we'll get back in the car,
and then we'll drive, and drive...

01:39:26.225 --> 01:39:28.644
.. we'll find another perfect place.

01:39:30.104 --> 01:39:31.814
I'm just...

01:39:31.814 --> 01:39:34.066
.. this is kind of sudden.
Isn't it?

01:39:34.066 --> 01:39:36.151
This is crazy.

01:39:36.235 --> 01:39:38.946
Well, not to me, it isn't.

01:39:44.785 --> 01:39:47.162
I need a whisky.

01:39:47.162 --> 01:39:50.416
Can I have a whisky, please?

01:39:52.376 --> 01:39:56.422
Vodka, please, and a glass of milk.

01:39:56.422 --> 01:39:58.173
Could you warm the milk?

01:40:00.134 --> 01:40:05.014
I got a right side problem
of some sort.

01:40:05.139 --> 01:40:07.433
God, I hope
I don't have a brain tumor.

01:40:07.433 --> 01:40:08.600
Hi, Terry.

01:40:12.146 --> 01:40:14.606
How is it going?

01:40:14.732 --> 01:40:16.025
Hi, Joe.

01:40:16.025 --> 01:40:17.026
What's going on?

01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:20.612
Not much. Just...

01:40:20.779 --> 01:40:22.281
You're here by yourself?

01:40:27.202 --> 01:40:29.038
You're OK?

01:40:29.079 --> 01:40:30.998
I'm having trouble
feeling my lips a little.

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.791
- They're not numb, are they?
- A little bit numb.

01:40:32.875 --> 01:40:34.043
Oh, boy!

01:40:34.126 --> 01:40:37.046
- Joe!
- Hi.

01:40:37.046 --> 01:40:38.422
I thought you were asleep.

01:40:38.464 --> 01:40:40.883
Yeah. I was asleep.

01:40:41.008 --> 01:40:42.801
He woke up.

01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:46.555
Anybody wanna dance?

01:40:46.639 --> 01:40:47.848
No. I don't think so.

01:40:47.848 --> 01:40:49.683
- Why don't you dance with Kate?
- No. Not me.

01:40:49.683 --> 01:40:50.601
No, go ahead.

01:40:50.601 --> 01:40:52.519
I'm not really a dancer, you know.

01:40:52.519 --> 01:40:54.104
Come on, you're a big dancer.

01:40:54.188 --> 01:40:55.439
- Dance with her.
- I don't feel my arm.

01:40:56.106 --> 01:40:57.316
I'd rather not, Kate.

01:40:57.358 --> 01:40:59.318
Kate's got her dancing clothes on.

01:40:59.318 --> 01:41:00.653
I just wanna sit...

01:41:00.653 --> 01:41:04.073
Come on, get over there...

01:41:06.492 --> 01:41:07.534
You're all right?

01:41:07.576 --> 01:41:09.286
You kids, have fun.

01:41:09.328 --> 01:41:11.372
- Terry, you're odd.
- No. Just fine.

01:41:11.372 --> 01:41:12.998
You're kind of tilt?

01:41:12.998 --> 01:41:15.125
Yeah, well just a momentary...

01:41:19.505 --> 01:41:21.256
Actually, I'm very, very
light on my feet.

01:41:21.256 --> 01:41:22.758
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

01:41:23.008 --> 01:41:24.677
I'm a... pretty good dancer.

01:41:26.345 --> 01:41:27.972
Looking good, Terry.

01:41:28.055 --> 01:41:29.807
That's a pretty song.

01:41:29.932 --> 01:41:32.101
Come on, dance with me, Kate.

01:41:32.142 --> 01:41:34.645
Oh! Maybe you should do
us some dinner.

01:41:34.645 --> 01:41:36.855
- Happy?
- What, honey?

01:41:42.444 --> 01:41:43.946
Mind if I cut in?

01:41:43.988 --> 01:41:46.740
Yeah, sure.
I've lost the beat.

01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:48.367
Don't you think we should...

01:41:48.409 --> 01:41:51.286
No, no! He'll be fine.
Just take a little rest.

01:41:55.290 --> 01:41:57.584
You guys go right ahead...

01:41:57.584 --> 01:41:59.837
Dance with me.

01:41:59.837 --> 01:42:03.007
Run away with me, Kate.

01:42:03.132 --> 01:42:06.051
We can get in the car and just drive,
and drive, and drive.

01:42:06.093 --> 01:42:08.637
Hm? That is a great idea.

01:42:10.639 --> 01:42:13.559
What about Mexico?

01:42:13.559 --> 01:42:15.144
Mexico will wait.

01:42:16.562 --> 01:42:18.397
What about Terry?

01:42:23.027 --> 01:42:24.611
Terry will just have to wait, too.

01:42:26.864 --> 01:42:29.158
I am so confused.

01:42:29.199 --> 01:42:31.577
In what way?

01:42:31.702 --> 01:42:34.455
In every possible way.

01:42:34.455 --> 01:42:36.874
Just come on outside with me
for a minute. Come on.

01:42:36.874 --> 01:42:38.208
I've got a hot milk.

01:42:38.292 --> 01:42:39.293
What?

01:42:39.293 --> 01:42:41.211
I've got Terry some hot milk.

01:42:41.211 --> 01:42:42.421
I'll just get him a hot milk.

01:42:42.463 --> 01:42:44.340
I'll go check on Terry.

01:42:49.178 --> 01:42:50.095
You're all right?

01:42:51.764 --> 01:42:54.058
I've got you some milk.
Will help you sleep.

01:42:54.099 --> 01:42:55.601
I'm lactose intolerant.

01:42:55.601 --> 01:42:56.769
You're what?

01:42:56.769 --> 01:42:57.895
Lactose intolerant.

01:42:57.895 --> 01:43:00.314
You're lactose intolerant?

01:43:00.356 --> 01:43:01.774
Severe diarrhea.

01:43:01.774 --> 01:43:03.484
Severe diarr...
Right.

01:43:04.485 --> 01:43:06.654
I'll just be outside,
here on the porch.

01:43:11.033 --> 01:43:12.534
Do you smell burning feathers?

01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:13.786
Burning feathers?

01:43:13.786 --> 01:43:16.497
Joe's older brother, Albert.

01:43:16.497 --> 01:43:18.791
He smelled burning feathers.

01:43:18.832 --> 01:43:20.125
He had a brain tumor.

01:43:20.209 --> 01:43:23.420
Joe doesn't have an older brother.

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:26.215
I have no right side.

01:43:26.215 --> 01:43:27.967
No right side?
Is that what Joe told you?

01:43:28.092 --> 01:43:29.051
Can you feel this?

01:43:30.219 --> 01:43:31.804
Oh! Yes, I feel that!
It hurt.

01:43:35.265 --> 01:43:37.142
Joe does not have a brother?

01:43:37.226 --> 01:43:38.143
- No brother.
- Albert?

01:43:38.227 --> 01:43:40.980
No Albert.

01:43:41.063 --> 01:43:42.648
So the burning feathers was a lie.

01:43:46.235 --> 01:43:47.152
You're sure?

01:43:47.236 --> 01:43:48.529
Positive.

01:43:53.367 --> 01:43:54.994
Where is Joe?

01:43:54.994 --> 01:43:56.286
Outside.

01:43:56.286 --> 01:43:57.538
Joe, I've been thinking.

01:43:57.538 --> 01:43:58.831
Yeah, me too.

01:43:58.872 --> 01:44:03.002
I've been thinking that I don't have a
brain tumor because
you never had a brother.

01:44:03.002 --> 01:44:04.003
And I can walk, too.

01:44:04.003 --> 01:44:05.004
Did you notice that, Joe?

01:44:05.004 --> 01:44:06.005
Look at me. I'm walking.

01:44:06.005 --> 01:44:07.256
I'm walking around you.
You see?

01:44:07.256 --> 01:44:09.258
Never cheat a pal!
Never cheat a pal.

01:44:09.258 --> 01:44:11.427
- Isn't that what you always said?
- You cheated me first!

01:44:11.468 --> 01:44:12.428
I did not! Did not!

01:44:12.553 --> 01:44:13.554
You cheated me first!

01:44:13.554 --> 01:44:15.306
- Yes, you did!
- Bullshit!

01:44:15.306 --> 01:44:16.307
What about Paradise?

01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:18.475
I don't give a damn about Paradise.

01:44:18.475 --> 01:44:20.769
- I'm out of here.
- Well, guess what? Me, too.

01:44:20.853 --> 01:44:21.687
Ok? Happy?

01:44:21.729 --> 01:44:24.606
You won't make it a week without me
and you know it.

01:44:24.732 --> 01:44:26.108
I will with Kate.

01:44:26.108 --> 01:44:28.569
Over my dead body!

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:38.162
That hurt! Shithead!

01:44:38.162 --> 01:44:39.163
You bit me!

01:44:39.163 --> 01:44:40.164
Stop it!

01:44:40.164 --> 01:44:41.165
You hit me!

01:44:41.165 --> 01:44:42.583
Just stop it!?

01:44:42.583 --> 01:44:44.585
Oh, God. This is over!

01:44:44.585 --> 01:44:48.005
Not till somebody is
either dead or in a coma.

01:44:48.047 --> 01:44:49.715
And I hope it's him!

01:44:49.757 --> 01:44:51.467
No, I'm talking about us.

01:44:53.719 --> 01:44:55.638
I won't let you do this to each other.

01:44:55.763 --> 01:44:58.641
I just... I can't.

01:44:58.766 --> 01:44:59.892
I'd rather see you in prison.

01:45:00.059 --> 01:45:01.644
At least there you'll be safe
from each other.

01:45:01.769 --> 01:45:04.647
And yes, I'm aware that this is
entirely my own fault.

01:45:04.647 --> 01:45:05.898
Is just that I...

01:45:05.898 --> 01:45:07.650
.. I bit off a little more
than I could chew...

01:45:07.733 --> 01:45:09.485
.. but I...

01:45:09.610 --> 01:45:11.487
.. I just never felt
this way before, and...

01:45:13.197 --> 01:45:14.740
.. I...

01:45:14.782 --> 01:45:17.493
.. I can't choose between you.

01:45:19.787 --> 01:45:21.914
What if everyone only
has one big love?

01:45:21.914 --> 01:45:24.750
I mean, I know that this one's a
little bit bigger than usual, but...

01:45:27.628 --> 01:45:29.505
.. what if we only have one?

01:45:33.509 --> 01:45:36.136
And you know why
I can't choose between you?

01:45:37.805 --> 01:45:39.098
Because together, you're...

01:45:40.808 --> 01:45:42.434
.. you're the perfect man.

01:45:44.770 --> 01:45:48.774
Kate, we weren't...
we weren't really gonna... Right?

01:45:48.774 --> 01:45:51.694
Yeah.

01:45:51.694 --> 01:45:53.404
I'm sorry, boys.

01:45:58.993 --> 01:46:00.244
This is over.

01:46:06.333 --> 01:46:08.043
Kate!

01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:55.758
Big, ain't it?

01:46:55.758 --> 01:46:58.761
Hmm, it's just a bank.

01:46:58.761 --> 01:47:00.638
Big.

01:47:00.638 --> 01:47:03.057
Yeah. Big.

01:47:14.735 --> 01:47:15.736
Oh, my God!
It's them.

01:47:15.736 --> 01:47:18.238
They're here.

01:47:18.364 --> 01:47:19.323
Oh, mamma.

01:47:20.449 --> 01:47:25.079
Kate Wheeler may have started out
as a hostage but she's looking more
and more like a bank robber to me.

01:47:25.079 --> 01:47:26.038
That's ridiculous.

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:28.499
There's no way we can calculate the
impact of her captivity.

01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:30.376
This is Patty Hearst all over again.

01:47:30.376 --> 01:47:32.044
Patty Hearst went to prison...

01:47:32.086 --> 01:47:33.045
Which was a mistake...

01:47:33.087 --> 01:47:36.507
Excuse me.
It's long distance.

01:47:37.967 --> 01:47:39.677
You wanna tell her you
love her right now?

01:47:39.677 --> 01:47:40.761
Both of us.

01:47:40.761 --> 01:47:42.096
Yeah, and she knows it.

01:47:42.137 --> 01:47:44.556
Listen. Listen to me.

01:47:44.556 --> 01:47:46.266
I miss you.

01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:48.769
And Joe misses you.

01:47:48.769 --> 01:47:50.688
What I'm trying to say is
we both miss you.

01:47:50.688 --> 01:47:51.814
Equally, equally.

01:47:51.814 --> 01:47:53.524
We both miss you equally.

01:47:53.524 --> 01:47:55.818
Hi. Hi.
How are you doing?

01:47:56.986 --> 01:47:57.987
Well, we've been, we've been...

01:47:57.987 --> 01:48:00.406
.. thinking.

01:48:00.406 --> 01:48:02.950
I've been doing some thinking, too.

01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:05.119
What were you thinking?

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:06.245
I can't live like this.

01:48:06.245 --> 01:48:08.372
I mean that's the first thing.

01:48:08.414 --> 01:48:09.873
Well...

01:48:09.957 --> 01:48:14.086
.. which is entirely our fault
and we take full responsibility.

01:48:14.128 --> 01:48:15.129
- Really.
- Absolutely.

01:48:16.422 --> 01:48:19.091
No. It doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

01:48:19.133 --> 01:48:20.426
Not anymore.

01:48:20.467 --> 01:48:22.136
Let me talk to her.

01:48:22.177 --> 01:48:23.679
Listen to me.

01:48:23.679 --> 01:48:27.141
What if I told you
there was a way out of this?

01:48:27.141 --> 01:48:29.184
One more, big score. OK?

01:48:29.184 --> 01:48:31.437
Just one.
Nice and safe.

01:48:31.437 --> 01:48:35.774
Oh, I don't like the sound of this.

01:48:35.858 --> 01:48:38.152
No, no. No more tricks.

01:48:38.193 --> 01:48:40.446
No more tricks.
No more sleep-overs.

01:48:40.446 --> 01:48:43.574
We just walk in, we show them our
guns, we take the money...

01:48:43.574 --> 01:48:45.159
You show them your guns?

01:48:45.159 --> 01:48:47.328
But... we've got it all figured out.

01:48:47.411 --> 01:48:50.039
No! No! I can't let you do this.

01:48:50.039 --> 01:48:51.790
Oh, no! Please don't do this.

01:48:51.874 --> 01:48:53.917
It's a really bad idea.

01:48:53.917 --> 01:48:57.338
Kate, Kate, listen to me.
Listen to me.

01:48:57.338 --> 01:49:00.215
This will work.

01:49:00.215 --> 01:49:03.886
The reward for the capture of
Joe Blake and Terry Collins
has been doubled.

01:49:03.886 --> 01:49:05.471
To a million dollars.

01:49:05.596 --> 01:49:10.059
Question now is how much longer the
two can continue their crime spree.

01:49:10.059 --> 01:49:12.436
Their faces are known
to just about everyone...

01:49:16.482 --> 01:49:17.483
Good morning.

01:49:17.483 --> 01:49:19.026
How are you doing? Let's go.

01:49:19.068 --> 01:49:21.945
Outside. Come on.

01:49:22.029 --> 01:49:23.489
Keep moving, Shorty.

01:49:23.489 --> 01:49:24.490
Oh, my God!

01:49:24.531 --> 01:49:25.616
What are you guys doing here?

01:49:25.616 --> 01:49:27.493
Shut up. Let's go.

01:49:27.618 --> 01:49:28.535
All right. All right.

01:49:28.535 --> 01:49:29.745
Come on. You too.

01:49:29.787 --> 01:49:30.746
In front of us. In front of us.

01:49:30.788 --> 01:49:31.747
Here we go.

01:49:31.789 --> 01:49:32.957
Good evening everybody,
I'm Darren Head.

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:34.917
.. and welcome to
"Criminals at Large".

01:49:34.959 --> 01:49:37.836
We have a very interesting and
unusual show this evening.

01:49:37.836 --> 01:49:40.798
If you look behind me, you can
see that we're not here on the set
of "Criminals at Large".

01:49:41.382 --> 01:49:43.509
We're broadcasting tonight
out of my home, out of my
living room...

01:49:43.509 --> 01:49:46.553
The "Sleep-Over Bandits" Joe Blake
and Terry Collins are sitting with me.

01:49:46.553 --> 01:49:49.098
They wanted to set the record
straight about Kate Wheeler.

01:49:49.098 --> 01:49:53.227
I wanna say to you,
to the American public...

01:49:53.227 --> 01:49:57.564
.. to all of the law enforcement
agencies out there across America...

01:49:57.690 --> 01:50:02.069
.. Kate Wheeler was never involved
in the bank robberies with us.

01:50:02.069 --> 01:50:03.988
She was our hostage...

01:50:04.071 --> 01:50:05.990
.. she was an unwilling hostage...

01:50:06.115 --> 01:50:09.243
.. she was never, ever involved.

01:50:42.318 --> 01:50:43.736
Ladies and gentlemen,
good morning!

01:50:43.777 --> 01:50:45.279
You are about to be robbed.

01:50:49.491 --> 01:50:51.452
I'm Kate Wheeler.

01:50:53.203 --> 01:50:54.747
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

01:50:54.747 --> 01:50:55.914
Where's the bank manager?

01:51:06.216 --> 01:51:08.427
Very good, sir!
Come with me!

01:51:09.887 --> 01:51:11.347
Nobody moves!

01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:13.349
The gentleman there,
there on the corner.

01:51:13.349 --> 01:51:14.558
Lay down!

01:51:15.517 --> 01:51:17.561
I've never heard them talk like
this before...

01:51:17.561 --> 01:51:20.939
.. and I think they're armed,
they're dangerous, and I think
they're serious.

01:51:29.365 --> 01:51:31.325
All right. Let's make contact
with them.

01:51:31.367 --> 01:51:32.910
The SWAT team is standing around.

01:51:32.910 --> 01:51:34.536
The helicopters are overhead.

01:51:34.536 --> 01:51:37.373
It's an incredible scene here at the
Alamo Savings and Loans.

01:51:37.414 --> 01:51:38.958
It's ringing.

01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:45.756
Yeah! Let me tell you something!

01:51:45.798 --> 01:51:46.924
This is Joe Blake, OK?

01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:48.801
You will never take us alive!

01:51:48.926 --> 01:51:50.511
Do you understand me?

01:51:50.552 --> 01:51:53.097
Now, we want safe passage to
Burbank airport...

01:51:53.097 --> 01:51:55.557
.. and we want
a plane to fly us out of there.

01:51:55.683 --> 01:51:58.519
No! No more phone calls, OK?

01:51:58.519 --> 01:52:00.437
You just do what I ask you!

01:52:00.437 --> 01:52:04.441
Hey!
You are not gonna take us alive!

01:52:07.236 --> 01:52:09.530
"You're not gonna take us alive?"

01:52:09.530 --> 01:52:10.990
That's right.

01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:12.658
Great thinking, Joe!

01:52:12.658 --> 01:52:15.828
How about,
they will not take you alive!

01:52:15.869 --> 01:52:17.663
You know, I'm flattered that you've
included me in your little...

01:52:17.663 --> 01:52:19.999
.. going out in a hail of gunfire
kind of concept...

01:52:19.999 --> 01:52:23.127
.. and everything,
but I think you've gone nuts, frankly.

01:52:23.168 --> 01:52:25.421
The troops are moving in here,
the SWAT team is moving in...

01:52:25.421 --> 01:52:27.131
.. the helicopters are overhead...

01:52:27.131 --> 01:52:29.717
If you look in the back there you can
see that Joe Blake and Terry Collins
are in the bank...

01:52:29.717 --> 01:52:31.468
.. the hostages are still in there...

01:52:31.552 --> 01:52:33.012
Everybody, hold your positions.

01:52:33.137 --> 01:52:34.847
I'm all through running, Terry.

01:52:34.847 --> 01:52:36.307
And guess what? I am, too!

01:52:36.307 --> 01:52:38.434
But I got a better idea.

01:52:38.559 --> 01:52:39.560
I wanna throw down my weapon...

01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:42.146
..and put my hands in the air and
go bank to the federal penitentiary...

01:52:42.146 --> 01:52:43.564
.. where Kate Wheeler wants us!

01:52:45.566 --> 01:52:46.900
Can't let you do that!

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:47.735
Oh, really?

01:52:47.776 --> 01:52:49.028
What if I don't give you that option?

01:52:49.028 --> 01:52:50.904
Everybody, hold your position.

01:52:50.904 --> 01:52:52.865
You guys, just hold on one second.

01:52:52.906 --> 01:52:54.742
- Put that gun down!
- Make me!

01:52:54.783 --> 01:52:55.868
- Make me?
- Yes, make you!

01:52:55.868 --> 01:52:57.328
Come on, this is not the third grade...

01:52:57.453 --> 01:52:58.787
You can't do any better than that?

01:52:58.787 --> 01:53:00.456
Well, I'm out of well-turned phrases
at this point, Joe!

01:53:00.456 --> 01:53:02.791
The suspects are in a standoff to
themselves.

01:53:02.875 --> 01:53:04.168
Put your gun down!

01:53:04.209 --> 01:53:05.461
Hey, don't even think about that!

01:53:05.461 --> 01:53:06.754
Hey don't you point that gun at him!

01:53:06.795 --> 01:53:07.796
Now, get out of here!

01:53:07.921 --> 01:53:09.173
And the rest of you, too!

01:53:09.173 --> 01:53:11.008
Don't anybody move!

01:53:12.301 --> 01:53:14.595
That's a hostage coming out!
That's a hostage!

01:53:14.595 --> 01:53:16.180
It looks like
somebody's coming out of the bank.

01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:17.348
Somebody's coming out of the bank.

01:53:17.348 --> 01:53:18.891
Joe Blake and Terry Collins
are in there...

01:53:19.016 --> 01:53:21.602
- Put it down!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:26.732
That shot was just fired
from the inside!

01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:30.653
You shot me!

01:53:35.491 --> 01:53:37.618
You bastard!

01:53:37.618 --> 01:53:39.620
Oh, God!

01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:42.414
Be advised! The suspects
are shooting at each other!

01:53:55.052 --> 01:53:57.388
You, son of a bitch!

01:54:04.228 --> 01:54:06.438
All right. On Terry!

01:54:06.438 --> 01:54:08.232
Stand by!

01:54:08.232 --> 01:54:09.400
Hold your positions!
Hold your positions!

01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.443
Come on! Red team!
Everybody just hold!

01:54:15.948 --> 01:54:18.409
All right. This will be the
shotgun on Terry.

01:54:20.995 --> 01:54:22.454
Now!

01:54:25.416 --> 01:54:27.251
Wonderful.

01:54:27.251 --> 01:54:29.420
Suspects appear to be down inside!

01:54:29.545 --> 01:54:31.422
- Just go on!
- Get out!

01:54:34.258 --> 01:54:36.719
Applause.

01:54:36.719 --> 01:54:37.845
Red Team, go!

01:54:37.845 --> 01:54:39.596
Red Team, go!

01:54:39.596 --> 01:54:40.848
Secure them!

01:54:42.725 --> 01:54:43.767
What is she doing?

01:54:43.851 --> 01:54:45.102
Come on, let's go!

01:54:53.402 --> 01:54:54.445
Unbelievable!

01:54:54.445 --> 01:54:56.196
Joe Blake and Terry Collins
are down!

01:55:03.078 --> 01:55:05.331
The police shot them,
or they shot themselves...

01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:07.875
... but it looks like that Kate Wheeler
is up on the stairs; she's fainting!

01:55:07.916 --> 01:55:11.920
Kate Wheeler is the woman who
turned in the "Sleep-Over Bandits".

01:55:18.761 --> 01:55:20.638
I need help here for Mrs. Wheeler.

01:55:20.638 --> 01:55:22.097
Let's move! Now!

01:55:26.477 --> 01:55:29.730
They're picking her up...
Get a shot of her! Right there!

01:55:37.112 --> 01:55:38.822
You fainted on the steps there.

01:55:38.906 --> 01:55:40.199
Are you in shock?

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:42.785
- What happened there?
- Yes. I was just in complete shock!

01:55:58.550 --> 01:56:02.054
Mrs. Wheeler, it is true that you
tipped off the police about the bank
robbery?

01:56:02.096 --> 01:56:04.223
Yes. I did.

01:56:04.348 --> 01:56:06.976
But none of this was...
supposed to happen.

01:56:06.976 --> 01:56:09.937
I just wanted them to stop.

01:56:17.403 --> 01:56:20.656
Good morning, sunshine!

01:56:20.698 --> 01:56:23.117
Open the bag!

01:56:23.117 --> 01:56:24.827
Come on, let's go!

01:56:24.868 --> 01:56:27.121
Great job, you guys!
Great job!

01:56:27.121 --> 01:56:28.289
Let's get out of here.

01:56:28.289 --> 01:56:30.124
OK! Let's go!

01:56:30.165 --> 01:56:32.418
Grab the money!
Come on! Come on!

01:56:35.963 --> 01:56:37.589
OK! Let's get out of here!

01:57:05.284 --> 01:57:06.535
Oh, God!

01:57:06.535 --> 01:57:08.245
It's gonna blow!

01:57:08.287 --> 01:57:10.581
You've gotta run! It's gonna blow!

01:57:17.212 --> 01:57:21.091
The vehicle transporting the bodies
of the "Sleep-Over Bandits",
has exploded.

01:57:21.091 --> 01:57:23.218
Apparently, the bodies were wired
with explosive.

01:57:23.302 --> 01:57:26.889
The bodies were totally
incinerated with no trace of
Joe Black and Terry Collins.

01:57:27.014 --> 01:57:28.307
Toast to Paradise.

01:57:28.349 --> 01:57:30.184
To us!

01:57:30.225 --> 01:57:31.185
You'd better wait for me!

01:57:31.226 --> 01:57:35.481
.. and the million-dollar reward!

01:57:35.481 --> 01:57:38.025
So ends the tragic tale of the
"Sleep-Over Bandits".

01:57:38.067 --> 01:57:40.194
Or it doesn't.

01:57:40.319 --> 01:57:43.489
Joe Blake and Terry Collins captured
the imagination of a nation.

01:57:43.489 --> 01:57:46.909
And in death their lives are quickly
becoming the stuff of legends.

01:57:46.909 --> 01:57:48.661
Blake and Collins weren't heroes.

01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:49.828
They never claimed to be.

01:57:49.828 --> 01:57:51.372
After the interview,
people came up to me and said:

01:57:51.372 --> 01:57:53.082
"What were they really like?"

01:57:53.082 --> 01:57:54.541
I know as much as anybody else:

01:57:54.541 --> 01:57:55.501
They robbed banks...

01:57:55.668 --> 01:57:59.421
They certainly kidnapped the wrong
woman, they shot each other to death
in cold blood.

01:57:59.421 --> 01:58:01.256
The rest is rumors and
speculations.

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:03.133
Stuff of folk tales.

01:58:03.133 --> 01:58:04.426
And in the end...

01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:07.137
.. maybe that's the way we really
want it to be.

01:58:07.221 --> 01:58:08.430
I'm Darren Head.

01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:12.851
We'll see you next week on another
edition of "Criminals at Large".

01:58:12.851 --> 01:58:14.812
.. fade to black.

01:58:14.812 --> 01:58:16.355
That should do.

01:58:25.572 --> 01:58:28.450
.. who are now united together in holy
matrimony.

01:58:32.663 --> 01:58:36.458
.. and have witnessed the same before
God and this company.

01:58:36.458 --> 01:58:39.420
.. and have pledged their love to
each other.

01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:44.133
.. and have declared the same by the
joining and the giving of the rings.

01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:52.850
The groom may now kiss the bride.

01:59:31.472 --> 01:59:32.640
Hi, gentlemen.

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:34.892
So, why don't we start from the
beginning, all right?

01:59:34.892 --> 01:59:36.894
How... how did you guys meet?

01:59:36.894 --> 01:59:42.524
Well, you know, lifting weights,
pumping the iron, you know the
usual way, trading cigarettes...

01:59:42.524 --> 01:59:45.778
Terry had an imaginary appendicitis...

01:59:45.778 --> 01:59:50.199
.. and then he had an imaginary
blood poisoning.

01:59:50.199 --> 01:59:51.742
I was working in the infirmary.

01:59:51.784 --> 01:59:53.953
The medical term is septicemia,
and it wasn't...

01:59:54.036 --> 01:59:57.957
Anyway, one night in the infirmary,
I'm hearing this howling sound...

01:59:58.040 --> 01:59:59.792
Darren.

01:59:59.792 --> 02:00:01.418
You know, like a...

02:00:01.502 --> 02:00:03.837
.. like the noise the cat makes when
the cat's in heat.

02:00:06.382 --> 02:00:08.509
That sound, you know.

02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:10.552
One thing we always like to
remind ourselves...

02:00:10.636 --> 02:00:14.807
.. before going into any job
was "expect the unexpected".

02:00:14.807 --> 02:00:15.849
Right?

02:00:15.849 --> 02:00:17.559
Always sounds like good advice.

02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:21.814
Except, of course, if you are
expecting the unexpected, and...

02:00:21.814 --> 02:00:25.401
.. well then it really isn't unexpected
anymore, is it?

02:00:25.401 --> 02:00:31.115
And that leaves you vulnerable to the
truly unexpected.

02:00:31.156 --> 02:00:33.284
Because you're not expecting it.

02:00:33.409 --> 02:00:35.286
Everybody saw the videotape.

02:00:35.369 --> 02:00:36.412
It's kind of famous by now.

02:00:36.412 --> 02:00:38.414
.. with Kate Wheeler, the bank
robbery...

02:00:38.539 --> 02:00:45.129
Why don't you, right here on this
show, set the records straight about
Kate Wheeler and your operation.

02:00:45.170 --> 02:00:48.882
The girl was terrified, you know...

02:00:48.882 --> 02:00:50.843
.. with us, I think...

02:00:50.843 --> 02:00:54.722
.. both as men, and as bank robbers.

02:00:54.722 --> 02:00:56.015
And didn't like us.

02:00:56.015 --> 02:00:57.016
Never liked us...

02:00:57.099 --> 02:00:58.434
.. we never got along...

02:00:58.434 --> 02:01:01.145
.. from the very first moment we met.

02:01:01.145 --> 02:01:02.563
Don't you guys
ever get really scared?

02:01:02.604 --> 02:01:05.107
I mean, this job is so dangerous...

02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:09.111
I'm immune to danger.
I dance with danger.

02:01:09.153 --> 02:01:11.280
I walk up to danger
and tug it on the ears...

02:01:11.322 --> 02:01:13.032
.. and sneer at it,
make funny faces at it.

02:01:13.115 --> 02:01:14.617
"You know what? Come on! "

02:01:14.742 --> 02:01:15.743
That's what I'm saying.

02:01:15.784 --> 02:01:17.161
You know how you have to be like?

02:01:17.161 --> 02:01:22.041
You have to have nerves of steel and
I have a nervous system which...

02:01:22.041 --> 02:01:24.877
I mean, as a child, God knows,
I was a nervous kid.

02:01:25.002 --> 02:01:26.211
But, you know,
you get in there...

02:01:26.295 --> 02:01:29.340
There's something about the
adrenaline, and...
What are you laughing at?

02:01:29.423 --> 02:01:31.008
You're immune.

02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:32.092
I'm immune to danger.
