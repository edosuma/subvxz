01:00.894 --> 01:02.194
You're leaving?

01:02.196 --> 01:04.328
Bye honey.

01:04.331 --> 01:07.366
God, I dreamt that
you were dizzy again.

01:07.368 --> 01:11.537
That's
not gonna happen.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.039
Be careful.

01:17.877 --> 01:19.111
You know me.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.514
I'll see ya in a few days.

02:16.536 --> 02:18.303
Undergrads don't
trust the equations.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.239
If the result is unintuitive,

02:20.241 --> 02:22.541
they're certain that it's wrong.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.910
It might be that under
convergence assumption,

02:24.912 --> 02:26.278
the priors are bounded,

02:26.280 --> 02:29.748
at least for the
accumulation of thresholds.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.617
I don't know, I have to
think about it a little more,

02:31.619 --> 02:35.020
but that's the direction
that I'm going.

03:09.722 --> 03:10.622
Hi.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.526
I'm working on it now.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.430
No, he gets home sometime today.

03:19.499 --> 03:20.399
Okay.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.035
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.103
Yeah, have a good night.

03:53.099 --> 03:56.235
Hey, sweets, how 'bout I
make you a little sandwich?

03:56.237 --> 03:58.203
Where is he?

03:59.138 --> 04:01.707
He is probably driving here.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.521
Do you like what I did?

04:16.523 --> 04:17.589
I like it.

04:19.659 --> 04:22.060
Doesn't sound like you do.

04:26.466 --> 04:27.366
I do.

04:28.601 --> 04:32.471
I guess I just got
tired of these stripes.

04:49.656 --> 04:50.889
Hi, you have
reached the voicemail

04:50.891 --> 04:53.292
of Paul hunger, please feel.

05:14.013 --> 05:14.913
Hey.

05:15.848 --> 05:17.516
You caught me.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.583
What's up?

05:20.119 --> 05:24.756
We had a fight so I drove
around the block a few times.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.892
What are you doing?

05:26.894 --> 05:31.129
Paul's late, I
thought you were him.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.431
You worried?

05:32.433 --> 05:35.901
No, his cell phone's
probably dead by now.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.370
Okay, well we're here
if you need anything.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.671
Thanks.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.672
Goodnight, sweetie.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.474
Goodnight.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.791
Professor hunger?

06:32.793 --> 06:33.859
Thank you.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.036
Tell me a
little more about these hikes.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.038
You called them survivalist?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.808
He
Takes the bare minimum.

06:49.810 --> 06:54.012
Eats edible plants,
catches his own food.

06:54.014 --> 06:57.349
He started training for
this a couple years ago.

06:57.351 --> 06:59.584
This is his second trip.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.088
And is he typically
gone three or four days?

07:03.090 --> 07:03.989
Yeah.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.857
22 Athens.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.460
I think I've located the
missing professor's Subaru.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.472
Paul!

08:27.474 --> 08:30.542
Team two will head
down the hill below me.

08:30.544 --> 08:34.513
Team three will go down
off the hill to my left.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.514
Paul!

08:35.515 --> 08:36.515
Paul!

08:43.655 --> 08:44.789
Paul!

08:46.459 --> 08:47.325
Paul!

08:47.327 --> 08:49.027
Paul!

08:49.029 --> 08:50.161
Paul!

08:54.267 --> 08:55.667
Paul!

09:09.849 --> 09:10.749
Paul.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.564
It's just half days.

10:00.733 --> 10:04.269
You've already missed
too much school.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.005
Everybody's gonna stare at me.

10:09.575 --> 10:10.742
Stare back.

10:46.746 --> 10:49.214
Athens police
chief Ken Doyle told wouu

10:49.216 --> 10:51.816
that the initial search,
which he stated is the most

10:51.818 --> 10:53.618
important time in a
missing person case,

10:53.620 --> 10:56.087
turned up only one campsite
that could have been hunger's,

10:56.089 --> 10:58.456
as well as his Subaru forester.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.159
Doctor hunger, a
professor of ornithology

11:01.161 --> 11:03.461
at Ohio university, was
on a four-day excursion

11:03.463 --> 11:07.565
when he did not return home
as planned, now 25 days ago.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.901
Doyle said only a few
small areas remain

11:09.903 --> 11:12.370
that have been deemed
too dangerous to search,

11:12.372 --> 11:14.806
due to recent heavy
rainfall in cliff areas,

11:14.808 --> 11:18.209
or because they are
inaccessible by air.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.581
Hi, professor hunger.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.816
Hi.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.020
We sonared the last
part of the river,

11:29.022 --> 11:30.555
and we found nothing.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.591
We sent two separate rescue
teams to the last two areas

11:33.593 --> 11:36.428
of the cliffs and the caves
that we can safely access,

11:36.430 --> 11:37.729
and we found nothing.

11:37.731 --> 11:40.265
We will, eventually,
do a second pass

11:40.267 --> 11:42.534
in some of those areas,
but the rain last month

11:42.536 --> 11:44.936
has made it very,
very difficult.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.939
We also talked to the
grad student, miss lorn,

11:47.941 --> 11:51.876
who was working on an art
project with doctor hunger.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.144
Who?

11:53.146 --> 11:56.214
Allison lorn.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.222
You mean the project
he was consulting on

12:04.224 --> 12:06.491
for the art department.

12:06.493 --> 12:10.095
It all checked out as a
legit university collaboration.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.130
They apparently made
something together.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.132
Made something?

12:14.134 --> 12:17.902
No, I don't think so, he was
their science consultant.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.471
I just wanted you to know
we followed this last lead

12:19.473 --> 12:21.206
and it went nowhere.

12:25.277 --> 12:26.177
Right.

12:27.613 --> 12:31.416
Paul has very clear
boundaries with students.

12:32.351 --> 12:33.251
Right.

12:38.658 --> 12:42.093
Claire.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.163
We don't need to
meet daily anymore.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.809
Are you really pulling
your men off the case?

12:57.811 --> 13:00.211
I'm sorry, but the guy
in upstate New York

13:00.213 --> 13:02.280
was missing for 30 days.

13:03.749 --> 13:07.986
We've done a massive search,
Claire, massive search.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.789
I hate to say it
but at this point,

13:10.791 --> 13:15.727
there's very little to do
unless we get new information.

13:15.729 --> 13:16.961
I am so sorry.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.337
Professor hunger?

13:59.339 --> 14:01.105
Did you see what I put in here?

14:01.107 --> 14:04.375
They sent it over from
the art department.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.277
Yeah, thank you.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.748
Do you need boxes?

14:10.750 --> 14:11.749
For what?

14:13.519 --> 14:18.356
I thought
maybe you were clearing out.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.257
No.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.460
I'm sorry.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.095
It's okay.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.597
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

14:25.599 --> 14:27.465
Let me know
if you need anything.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.766
I will.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.456
Hey.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.227
How was it?

15:01.667 --> 15:03.835
It'll be better tomorrow.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.414
There you go.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.920
I don't want to see
the counselor again.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.187
What did she say?

15:23.189 --> 15:24.255
Did she cry?

15:25.257 --> 15:26.257
A little.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.060
I knew it.

15:29.062 --> 15:32.597
She wants me to keep
watching the videos,

15:32.599 --> 15:36.100
and if I want to write
a letter to dad...

15:38.437 --> 15:43.241
Dear dad, please show up,
so that I can stop seeing

15:43.243 --> 15:47.512
this overwhelmed counselor
who's barely out of college

15:48.781 --> 15:51.816
and hasn't had enough
serious life experiences yet,

15:51.818 --> 15:54.886
to truly get what
I'm going through.

17:10.061 --> 17:12.896
Where
are we going today?

17:12.898 --> 17:16.334
It's a climbing area.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.637
Dad's not a climber.

17:19.638 --> 17:22.707
I just
wanna look around.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.464
Why is it closed off?

17:46.466 --> 17:48.666
I don't know.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.402
Maybe the rain made it slippery.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.208
I don't wanna do this anymore.

18:01.647 --> 18:02.547
Why not?

18:03.949 --> 18:06.017
I don't see the point.

18:11.623 --> 18:14.525
Well the point is, is
that it's possible that

18:14.527 --> 18:18.529
he's alive somewhere,
and until that goes away,

18:20.299 --> 18:22.366
we have to do something.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.311
Okay.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.848
You are super talented.

18:36.850 --> 18:37.849
Thank you.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.450
Can you see yourself?

18:40.653 --> 18:41.819
Mom!

18:41.821 --> 18:44.388
Okay let's take this corner.

18:47.326 --> 18:48.226
Carefully.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.631
Yes, sergeant?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.466
Goodnight, sweetie.

18:57.569 --> 18:58.636
Goodnight.

21:00.726 --> 21:01.626
Hey.

21:02.995 --> 21:07.498
Do you want to invite Troy
over for a sleepover tonight,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.834
or you could go over there?

21:09.836 --> 21:10.735
No.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.837
Are you sure?

21:12.839 --> 21:13.904
Yeah, bye.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.818
Hi, I'm looking
for Allison lorn.

21:33.192 --> 21:34.091
Thank you.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.212
Did that feel real at all?

21:55.214 --> 21:56.280
Yeah.

21:56.282 --> 21:57.948
It's getting there.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.321
Professor hunger.

22:07.959 --> 22:10.127
I'm so glad we're meeting.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.964
It's so cool to see you.

22:15.334 --> 22:19.236
And if you'll excuse us,
I'm learning how to fall.

22:20.305 --> 22:21.806
Okay.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.808
It's for my work, yeah.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.844
It's about contesting the
hierarchy of pleasure.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.180
It sounds heady, but
it's actually interesting

22:29.182 --> 22:30.981
and ridiculously fun.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.852
Did you get the art
supplies I sent you?

22:34.854 --> 22:37.054
I did, thank you.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.489
I actually have
something else for you,

22:38.491 --> 22:40.991
it's just, it's right over here.

23:03.615 --> 23:05.082
I don't get it.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.518
Paul made it.

23:09.454 --> 23:10.921
It goes this way.

23:18.497 --> 23:20.664
He was originally
consulting on a bird piece

23:20.666 --> 23:23.067
with professor spector, but,

23:24.403 --> 23:27.571
then he got interested
in this and...

23:29.641 --> 23:33.778
We were working on a piece
together for the show.

23:35.881 --> 23:38.048
That doesn't make you
uncomfortable, does it?

23:38.050 --> 23:39.216
No.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.785
Good.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.520
He thought it might.

23:45.657 --> 23:47.324
He told you that?

23:47.326 --> 23:50.060
I know you wanted
him to finish his book.

23:50.062 --> 23:53.063
And so did I, but I think
he was drawn to this work

23:53.065 --> 23:55.633
in a way he didn't anticipate.

23:56.568 --> 23:57.334
I'm sorry.

24:00.639 --> 24:01.705
Who are you?

24:05.877 --> 24:09.013
I, I was his
collaborator and friend.

24:13.318 --> 24:15.553
We were just good friends.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.055
That's all.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.024
I had to explain to
the cops that sex

24:20.026 --> 24:23.594
isn't the only thing
that makes you close.

24:30.902 --> 24:34.171
We're having a
party in his honor.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.874
It's on our website but
I think I have a flier.

24:36.876 --> 24:40.778
Paul loved our parties,
we'd love to have you.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.614
We?

24:43.616 --> 24:45.683
The art grad students.

24:49.087 --> 24:50.387
I have to go.

24:51.823 --> 24:52.723
Thank you.

24:53.792 --> 24:56.327
It was nice to
meet you, Allison.

25:18.316 --> 25:19.483
Hey Claire.

25:20.852 --> 25:21.752
Hi, stu.

25:23.588 --> 25:24.788
You wanna ride?

25:24.790 --> 25:28.192
No, thanks, I
like to walk, yeah.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.493
Anything new?

25:31.997 --> 25:33.297
No.

25:33.299 --> 25:34.765
Thanks.

25:34.767 --> 25:38.802
Jesus Christ, you think
he'd fuckin' be found by now.

25:38.804 --> 25:43.507
Why aren't they searching
right now, what are they doing?

25:43.509 --> 25:44.875
It's not a suspected homicide,

25:44.877 --> 25:48.245
so there's a limit
to what they do.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.648
They think he ran off?

25:50.650 --> 25:52.616
I don't think they...

25:53.418 --> 25:54.985
I don't think they, no...

25:54.987 --> 25:56.086
yeah.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.522
Yeah, this, this is bullshit.

25:58.524 --> 26:00.925
You don't deserve this Claire.

26:00.927 --> 26:05.162
Hey, anytime you need a stiff
drink, I'm buyin', okay?

26:06.331 --> 26:07.464
Okay, yeah.

26:07.466 --> 26:08.632
Alright.

26:08.634 --> 26:10.801
-Thank you, bye.
-See ya.

26:35.794 --> 26:37.194
Okay.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.362
Sharp.

26:39.664 --> 26:40.764
You are super talented.

26:40.766 --> 26:41.765
Thank you.

26:41.767 --> 26:42.800
In there?

26:44.470 --> 26:45.736
Mom!

26:45.738 --> 26:46.704
Bunny ears.

26:50.775 --> 26:53.544
Okay let's take this
corner, carefully.

26:53.546 --> 26:54.445
Yes.

26:56.214 --> 26:57.114
Sergeant.

26:59.351 --> 27:00.651
I'm with you!

27:07.392 --> 27:09.193
Excuse me, sir,

27:09.195 --> 27:11.729
what is the meaning
of this mess?

27:11.731 --> 27:14.898
And when are you
going to clean it up?

27:14.900 --> 27:16.767
Let's see, when I am
finished with this bloody

27:16.769 --> 27:19.103
burden of a book, good sir.

27:20.205 --> 27:21.839
Could you
please explain to me...

27:23.075 --> 27:24.675
This bird right here.

27:25.911 --> 27:29.046
This bird is called
the belted kingfisher.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.015
They call him the
kingfisher because of his

27:31.017 --> 27:35.252
remarkable nosedive with
which he catches his fish.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.475
What are you doing?

27:59.944 --> 28:02.479
Watching you.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.882
Yeah, you're watching me?

28:04.884 --> 28:06.283
What do you see?

28:10.055 --> 28:11.321
I
Can't see anything

28:11.323 --> 28:13.390
if you won't look at me.

28:14.626 --> 28:15.626
Okay I'll...

28:15.628 --> 28:17.361
look at me?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Look at me?

28:24.936 --> 28:26.704
I'm looking at you.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.673
No you're
not, not really.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.643
I feel
like they rear back.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.013
I like the stare.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.014
You do?

29:11.016 --> 29:11.915
Okay.

29:22.628 --> 29:24.361
That's getting
there, that's good.

29:24.363 --> 29:25.596
Hey, Claire.

29:26.498 --> 29:27.831
Hi.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.399
Hey, sorry, I...

29:31.002 --> 29:32.836
I thought I heard a noise.

29:32.838 --> 29:35.139
That's okay, Ryan was
just helping me rehearse.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.341
Been hoping to see you.

29:37.343 --> 29:38.243
Yeah.

29:39.677 --> 29:41.378
Hey, would you
like one, Claire?

29:41.380 --> 29:43.213
No, but thanks.

29:45.950 --> 29:46.917
Refill?

29:46.919 --> 29:47.818
Please.

29:52.991 --> 29:55.559
So, I heard the search is off.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.362
Yeah.

29:58.364 --> 29:59.663
I'm so sorry.

30:00.565 --> 30:01.465
Yeah.

30:05.236 --> 30:08.906
Hey, did you guys know
that Paul was working

30:08.908 --> 30:10.641
with an art student?

30:12.777 --> 30:13.677
No.

30:15.079 --> 30:15.979
Why?

30:16.848 --> 30:19.016
It's nothing, I just...

30:20.084 --> 30:23.787
I'm not sure that I
remember him telling me.

30:31.262 --> 30:34.431
Ryan says math is
a mess without you.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.167
That's what I've heard.

31:53.211 --> 31:54.912
He's not there.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.814
Did you have an appointment?

31:59.550 --> 32:01.685
No, no, I guess I didn't.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.389
Thank you, thank you.

32:17.335 --> 32:19.703
You don't have to
pick me up from school.

32:19.705 --> 32:20.737
I can walk home.

32:20.739 --> 32:21.805
I like to.

32:22.840 --> 32:23.674
Are you mad at me?

32:23.676 --> 32:24.908
No.

32:33.184 --> 32:35.485
Where are you going?

32:35.487 --> 32:37.821
I'm not doing it anymore.

32:38.923 --> 32:40.590
Fliering too?

32:41.492 --> 32:43.460
Yeah.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.595
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.431
The door's open, I'll
see you later, okay?

33:06.417 --> 33:07.317
Hi.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.233
Hi.

34:43.313 --> 34:44.547
It's too dangerous.

34:44.550 --> 34:48.318
There are significant
cliffs in that area.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.821
Infrared didn't find anything.

34:50.822 --> 34:54.658
If he fell, deep, into
one of those crevices,

34:55.760 --> 34:58.061
it just would've been over.

34:59.464 --> 35:00.931
I don't think there's any
sense in risking lives

35:00.933 --> 35:04.601
on what would now be
a recovery effort.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.136
I'm sorry.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.304
I get that.

35:08.439 --> 35:09.306
I do.

35:21.719 --> 35:22.619
Hi.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.188
You must be Connor.

35:35.366 --> 35:36.266
Hey.

35:41.339 --> 35:44.241
A student
left that for you.

35:48.446 --> 35:49.346
Yeah?

35:50.481 --> 35:51.815
What'd she say?

35:54.318 --> 35:57.687
She said that I had
dad's arms and legs.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.898
She was a little weird, but...

36:09.734 --> 36:11.568
It's a party for dad.

36:13.204 --> 36:14.104
Can I go?

36:16.274 --> 36:17.174
Well...

36:19.210 --> 36:22.145
It'll be a lot of art mfa's.

36:22.147 --> 36:23.880
Yeah, so?

36:25.249 --> 36:29.319
Well, to use your word,
they can be a little weird.

36:30.821 --> 36:33.123
You love your grad students.

36:33.125 --> 36:37.194
That is true, yes.

37:10.695 --> 37:12.596
Over there, sweetie.

37:14.832 --> 37:15.832
Let's do it.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.801
Gotta rip off the band-aid.

37:17.803 --> 37:20.637
We're not truly
free unless we can

37:20.639 --> 37:23.240
release them into the world.

37:23.242 --> 37:25.308
One, two, three!

37:35.119 --> 37:39.189
Everyone, this is
professor hunger and Connor.

37:43.527 --> 37:44.728
-Hello.
-Hello.

37:44.730 --> 37:45.729
-Hey.
-Hi.

37:46.931 --> 37:47.831
Hey.

37:57.375 --> 38:00.710
-One, two, three...
-For Paul.

38:21.198 --> 38:25.435
Yeah, the wood came from
the amish in Pennsylvania.

38:26.804 --> 38:30.974
My dad designed it so we'd
each have our own part.

38:32.910 --> 38:36.212
He passed away
last year, though.

38:36.214 --> 38:37.514
I'm sorry.

38:37.516 --> 38:38.882
It's fine.

38:40.084 --> 38:42.585
He was sick, it was his time.

38:46.223 --> 38:49.526
He was the last, so
I'm just like Paul.

38:52.163 --> 38:55.398
No extended family,
sort of an orphan.

38:56.867 --> 39:00.103
Paul has a stepbrother
in Australia.

39:01.505 --> 39:05.508
Yeah, that's right, the
one who works in construction.

39:13.284 --> 39:16.353
I really hope Paul's
okay somewhere.

40:08.005 --> 40:10.173
It's right over here.

40:18.616 --> 40:21.384
My dad made this?

40:21.386 --> 40:22.752
Yeah.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.155
But it's not done, so...

40:26.590 --> 40:29.325
Maybe you can help me finish it.

40:30.561 --> 40:33.163
How do you know how to?

40:33.165 --> 40:37.233
I don't, but that's
what makes it interesting.

40:42.473 --> 40:46.309
Hey, do you wanna
go to the ukelele pond?

40:47.178 --> 40:48.578
Yeah.

40:50.381 --> 40:51.681
Mom?

40:51.683 --> 40:53.483
I'll be right there,
sweetie, I need to...

40:53.485 --> 40:55.218
I'll be right there.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.482
Everything okay?

41:59.484 --> 42:01.718
Yeah, everything's fine.

42:04.655 --> 42:06.222
Connor's so sweet.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.861
I just wanted to
talk to you alone.

42:11.863 --> 42:12.762
Okay.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.265
What?

42:17.868 --> 42:19.769
I don't know I just...

42:19.771 --> 42:23.840
Wonder if he's off on
some experiment somewhere.

42:25.342 --> 42:30.280
He said that it all started
with the dizzy spells.

42:30.282 --> 42:34.450
They never really figured
out what was wrong?

42:34.452 --> 42:37.720
I just thought you
should know that...

42:39.256 --> 42:42.926
He was haunted by them,
but also intrigued.

42:45.262 --> 42:49.132
That it sparked the road to
his work at least partially.

42:49.134 --> 42:52.769
I mean his pieces about
falling and flying.

42:54.271 --> 42:55.171
Yeah.

42:57.508 --> 42:59.342
Do you know the
Stevie Smith poem,

42:59.344 --> 43:03.212
where the narrator confuses
waving with drowning?

43:03.214 --> 43:04.681
It was like that.

43:06.617 --> 43:08.785
I was much too far
out all my life,

43:08.787 --> 43:11.120
and not waving but drowning.

43:14.258 --> 43:16.259
He even went skydiving.

43:20.764 --> 43:23.333
Why are you telling me this?

43:25.836 --> 43:30.440
I just thought you would
wanna know what was going on.

43:30.442 --> 43:31.341
Okay.

43:33.544 --> 43:35.111
We're not friends.

43:36.847 --> 43:37.747
I...

43:41.085 --> 43:43.820
I'm not even sure I believe you.

44:09.813 --> 44:13.483
Yeah, you're
really good at this.

44:25.396 --> 44:27.530
Alright, sweetie, time to go.

44:27.532 --> 44:28.698
Yeah, okay.

44:31.769 --> 44:33.369
Take it, you can borrow it.

44:33.371 --> 44:34.370
Really?

44:34.372 --> 44:37.140
Sure, we have a couple of 'em.

44:37.142 --> 44:38.041
Thanks.

44:41.178 --> 44:43.579
You too, professor hunger.

44:45.716 --> 44:47.383
I'd like to get to
know you better.

44:47.385 --> 44:49.719
I'm sorry for upsetting you.

44:49.721 --> 44:51.621
You didn't upset me.

44:52.723 --> 44:54.390
You should come back
for the grad student

44:54.392 --> 44:56.893
exhibition next month.

44:56.895 --> 45:01.130
Or I'll be finishing his
piece, I'll be here all week.

45:02.900 --> 45:03.800
Maybe.

45:23.721 --> 45:24.620
Hey.

45:27.057 --> 45:27.957
I'm sorry.

45:30.360 --> 45:31.661
She's very odd.

45:35.099 --> 45:38.568
She thinks that dad
is alive somewhere.

45:42.539 --> 45:44.941
One of her friends
was telling me

45:44.943 --> 45:48.911
how you can go off
the grid in Alaska.

45:48.913 --> 45:51.247
And how if you don't
use your credit card,

45:51.249 --> 45:52.882
you can't be found.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.754
He would never do that.

46:01.325 --> 46:05.294
He didn't tell you or
me about the sculpture.

46:06.797 --> 46:10.466
I'm sure he was going
to tell me, and you.

46:14.638 --> 46:15.538
Okay?

46:18.342 --> 46:19.242
Okay.

47:19.536 --> 47:21.604
You're watching me?

47:22.406 --> 47:24.473
What do you see?

47:24.475 --> 47:27.310
I can't see anything
if you don't look at me.

47:27.312 --> 47:28.477
Okay I'll look...

47:28.479 --> 47:30.213
look at me?

47:35.619 --> 47:36.619
Look at me.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.489
I'm looking at you.

47:40.491 --> 47:42.625
You're not, not really.

47:43.393 --> 47:45.228
I'm looking at you.

48:39.449 --> 48:41.851
Why are you wearing those?

48:45.188 --> 48:46.322
I was cold.

48:58.135 --> 49:00.636
Are you going back to work?

49:03.173 --> 49:04.073
Yeah.

49:04.942 --> 49:06.909
Yeah, today, I'm...

49:07.911 --> 49:09.345
I have a meeting.

49:11.114 --> 49:12.014
Good.

49:27.597 --> 49:28.497
Hi.

49:29.866 --> 49:31.834
Hi.

49:31.836 --> 49:33.736
Sorry to bother you.

49:34.905 --> 49:36.439
What is it?

49:36.441 --> 49:40.309
I think you have my
performance art text.

49:40.311 --> 49:43.646
You took Paul's
stuff out of the studio.

49:43.648 --> 49:47.049
Sometimes I just study in there.

49:47.051 --> 49:48.751
I just need it for class.

49:48.753 --> 49:52.722
I'm sorry, hang on,
let me see if I have it.

49:52.724 --> 49:55.758
And I also wanted
to apologize.

49:55.760 --> 49:59.662
I try too hard, you
must think I'm a whack job.

49:59.664 --> 50:00.896
No.

50:02.099 --> 50:05.434
I said too much, I always do.

50:05.436 --> 50:07.203
It's okay.

50:07.205 --> 50:10.006
And you must think
I'm obsessed with Paul.

50:10.008 --> 50:11.307
I'm really not.

50:13.377 --> 50:16.345
We were just doing some
exciting work and...

50:16.347 --> 50:21.083
He is handsome, but I,
wasn't thinking about that.

50:21.085 --> 50:23.085
I'm sure it's weird to
have a stranger talk

50:23.087 --> 50:26.555
so intimately about
your husband, so...

50:26.557 --> 50:28.924
I promise to give you
space from now on.

50:28.926 --> 50:31.260
It's okay, it's just...

50:31.262 --> 50:33.562
It's a very confusing time.

50:34.531 --> 50:35.765
Yeah, it is.

50:36.867 --> 50:40.302
I'm just trying to be
open to everything.

50:44.941 --> 50:47.176
Well, I'm just...

50:47.178 --> 50:51.547
Trying to survive.

50:51.549 --> 50:52.448
Thanks.

51:26.316 --> 51:28.551
I'm so happy to see you.

51:31.621 --> 51:32.688
We need you.

51:34.691 --> 51:35.991
Thank you.

51:35.993 --> 51:36.826
Hi.

51:36.828 --> 51:37.760
It's great to see you.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.129
Well, it's good to be back.

51:48.038 --> 51:51.507
Okay, so there are
hundreds of posts on YouTube

51:51.509 --> 51:53.676
of kitty cats doing this.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.018
How is this?

52:05.722 --> 52:07.156
Good?

52:07.158 --> 52:08.224
Well done.

52:11.162 --> 52:12.695
It's very real.

52:12.697 --> 52:13.696
Thank you.

52:13.698 --> 52:15.264
Very, very real.

52:16.867 --> 52:18.100
Here's to you.

52:26.477 --> 52:29.211
Do you know who else
wanted to buy me a drink?

52:29.213 --> 52:33.449
The only other person that
has asked me to do anything?

52:34.251 --> 52:35.151
Stu.

52:36.453 --> 52:38.053
Stu with the clown car?

52:38.055 --> 52:38.954
My god.

52:40.624 --> 52:42.258
Well, why not?

52:42.260 --> 52:46.162
Come on, it's stu.

52:51.868 --> 52:53.202
It's so absurd.

53:00.477 --> 53:02.444
Did Paul seem...

53:02.446 --> 53:05.114
Strange to you before the hike?

53:09.786 --> 53:10.920
Not really.

53:12.956 --> 53:14.523
This grad student
thinks that he was having

53:14.525 --> 53:16.525
some sort of awakening.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.163
Maybe.

53:21.165 --> 53:23.365
Honestly, I think she's a
little obsessed with some idea

53:23.367 --> 53:25.100
of who Paul was, is.

53:30.907 --> 53:32.474
You know what?

53:32.476 --> 53:33.943
Enough about him.

53:37.380 --> 53:40.115
I'm kidding, but I'm not really.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.919
What I mean is,
what do you want?

54:24.761 --> 54:28.631
So it looks
like he jumped in April.

54:28.633 --> 54:29.698
I see.

54:32.669 --> 54:34.870
We still have his video.

54:34.872 --> 54:36.939
Would you like the link?

54:37.807 --> 54:38.941
Yeah, yeah.

54:40.677 --> 54:41.944
I'll...

54:41.946 --> 54:45.047
Here, write down your email.

54:55.091 --> 54:56.659
Could I do this?

54:57.560 --> 54:59.094
Anyone can do this.

54:59.096 --> 55:01.063
No, I mean right now.

55:02.165 --> 55:03.132
No...

55:04.501 --> 55:09.104
You have to take a class,
it's not an impulsive thing.

55:09.106 --> 55:10.372
Of course.

55:10.374 --> 55:11.273
I'm sorry.

55:12.609 --> 55:14.209
I'll send you
all the information though.

55:14.211 --> 55:15.878
That would be great.

55:15.880 --> 55:16.712
Great.

55:16.714 --> 55:17.546
Thank you.

55:17.548 --> 55:19.281
Thank you.

55:26.756 --> 55:27.656
Connor?

55:41.972 --> 55:43.972
It's not okay for you
to go without asking me.

55:43.974 --> 55:48.110
You told me you were gonna
come home on your own.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.082
You are.

55:58.054 --> 55:59.855
I'm not the best.

56:01.458 --> 56:02.358
Hi.

56:03.259 --> 56:05.127
Do you wanna help us?

56:05.129 --> 56:07.363
Connor, get your things.

56:11.868 --> 56:12.768
Why?

56:18.743 --> 56:19.875
He phoned me.

56:21.544 --> 56:23.011
It was my idea.

56:23.980 --> 56:26.382
Go get your stuff, please.

56:28.651 --> 56:29.551
Thank you.

56:36.826 --> 56:37.726
Okay.

56:40.096 --> 56:41.330
This is all...

56:42.332 --> 56:44.900
Just a little too close, okay?

56:49.105 --> 56:51.006
That's hard for you?

56:53.843 --> 56:57.446
Alright, Allison, unless
there's something you know

56:57.448 --> 56:59.848
about Paul's case
that I don't know,

56:59.850 --> 57:02.251
I don't wanna be in contact.

57:03.787 --> 57:05.721
Of course I know things.

57:05.723 --> 57:07.556
My god.

57:07.558 --> 57:08.791
Let's see...

57:09.959 --> 57:12.361
He was on and off about you.

57:13.663 --> 57:17.466
I told him he should
leave you but he wouldn't.

57:17.468 --> 57:21.103
I tried to sleep with
him, but he wouldn't.

57:22.672 --> 57:25.407
He was a little boring that way.

57:26.309 --> 57:27.209
We argued.

57:29.078 --> 57:32.314
One time he cried in my arms
out of sheer loneliness,

57:32.316 --> 57:36.051
and then he dismissed
the importance of it.

57:36.053 --> 57:40.289
I don't know how well I
knew him, but there you go.

57:41.558 --> 57:43.158
Are you done?

57:43.160 --> 57:44.393
With your act?

57:46.963 --> 57:49.164
Christ, you're like a
walking cliche of denial,

57:49.166 --> 57:51.300
just feel something.

57:51.302 --> 57:52.634
You know what?

57:52.636 --> 57:55.003
I feel things, okay?

57:55.005 --> 57:57.973
I feel plenty, the
way that I feel,

57:58.842 --> 58:00.075
fuck!

58:19.562 --> 58:21.830
This goes with me.

58:21.832 --> 58:23.665
Come here, sweetie,
you're gonna help me,

58:23.667 --> 58:25.367
we're gonna take this home.

58:33.176 --> 58:34.510
Alright, ready?

58:45.188 --> 58:46.188
Here.

58:46.190 --> 58:47.856
This is part of it.

58:49.259 --> 58:52.628
He would want it
to stay together.

58:52.630 --> 58:53.695
Thank you.

59:54.090 --> 59:55.424
You're leaving.

59:55.426 --> 59:57.292
Bye, honey.

59:57.294 --> 01:00:01.163
God, I dreamt that
you were dizzy again.

01:00:01.165 --> 01:00:05.400
That's
not gonna happen.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:13.575
Be careful.

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.645
You know me.

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:51.813
Hey mom.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.983
Troy invited me over
for a sleepover.

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:59.321
Is that okay with his
mom on a school night?

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:01.523
Yeah, it's fine.

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:02.891
Okay.

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:04.192
Alright, well have fun.

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:05.594
Okay.

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:49.698
If those motherfuckers
don't know what they're doing,

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.700
fire their asses.

01:02:51.702 --> 01:02:54.102
I once sued because I
wasn't getting what I wanted

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:57.439
out of these contractors
on the house.

01:02:57.441 --> 01:03:01.276
They didn't have a
fucking clue, I mean,

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:03.612
I looked at this idiot
and I'm like, hey man,

01:03:03.614 --> 01:03:06.047
if you can't wire a
house, you can't plumb,

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:10.152
you're not gonna get
the fucking roof right.

01:03:10.154 --> 01:03:14.389
There's so much uncertainty
and we're immersed in it.

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.293
Yeah.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:20.262
That's why I do math.

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:23.765
I hear ya.

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:28.970
You know, everyday,
that's what we do.

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.039
We estimate from belief.

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:35.343
Collect evidence,
adjust the belief,

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:40.448
correct for uncertainty,
repeat and repeat.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.689
I think beliefs
make you irrational.

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:50.158
And...

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:53.862
Unnatural.

01:03:58.734 --> 01:03:59.634
Optimized.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:21.990
God.

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:22.991
Sorry.

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:25.293
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:31.433
Thank you.

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:37.839
Do I know you?

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:40.976
I had you last year.

01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:46.815
I remember your face.

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:50.886
Can...

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:54.923
I'm sorry, can I
ask you something?

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:56.391
Okay.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:05:00.228
When you were in my class,
did you feel like...

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:04.332
Did you feel like I
knew what I was doing?

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:08.169
Did I, like I, had some
sense of consistency?

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:11.706
You were good.

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.777
I really liked your class.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:20.315
Thank you.

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:22.017
Thank you.

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:26.154
Okay, I'm sorry I
didn't remember you,

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:28.657
I'm sorry, I was lying before.

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:29.557
But...

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:34.896
I haven't really been
paying attention so...

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:36.197
Don't feel bad.

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:48.443
You know you gotta dance.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:49.444
Yes you do.

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:53.315
No I don't no, I'm
a terrible dancer.

01:05:53.317 --> 01:05:56.618
Yeah, here we go,
get it funky today.

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:05.093
My god.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.551
Yeah, there it is!

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:51.339
God, you're
fuckin' beautiful.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:53.508
You know I'm married, right?

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.243
Yeah, that's okay.

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:57.012
Okay.

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:54.436
You think this
is a good length?

01:07:54.438 --> 01:07:56.438
Yeah, you don't
want it too long.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.338
Okay.

01:08:06.949 --> 01:08:09.617
That's perfect, thank you.

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:18.359
You know, we could
just ask her for help.

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.363
I think we've got it.

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:31.272
Okay, I've gotta go.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.740
Okay, you want me
to pick you up later?

01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:36.810
No, I'll
take the bus to the library.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:54.295
Hello?

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:03.171
I'll
give you a minute.

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:01.996
I guess the fliers
triggered somebody's memory

01:10:01.998 --> 01:10:03.831
at the convenience store.

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:07.936
We checked the security
cams, found the tape.

01:10:07.938 --> 01:10:10.071
Timestamp is 20 days ago.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:16.311
I was hoping for something,

01:10:16.313 --> 01:10:18.446
but I don't think
it's conclusive.

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:20.615
Can't make out the image.

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:24.452
Guy swears up and down
he was there, though.

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:26.120
That's not unusual,
though, Claire,

01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:29.190
we get false witnesses
all the time.

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:34.395
Anyway, still felt like
I should show it to you.

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:36.531
Yeah.

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.808
Dear dad.

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:24.746
I don't actually know why
I'm writing you this letter.

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:25.647
Well.

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:28.750
My counselor told me to.

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:33.388
And it's a lot easier
than talking to mom.

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:37.025
She's acting strange.

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:41.496
She's sort of jumpy,

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:45.633
and then next she's
sort of spaced out.

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:54.142
Remember that kid
at school, Otto,

01:11:54.144 --> 01:11:57.679
who I told you is
really annoying?

01:11:57.681 --> 01:11:59.914
As it turns out, he's not.

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:04.519
Just has this sort of
weird thing for maps.

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:07.955
But he didn't tell anyone.

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:11.326
Like how I like to knit.

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:16.597
And I don't really tell
that to other kids.

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.801
I didn't really know him.

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:23.471
Anyway.

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:28.009
I'm not really sure what to say.

01:12:32.615 --> 01:12:35.283
If you're dead, then I'm sorry.

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:41.022
If you ran away to
start a new life,

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:44.025
then I guess I'm
really mad at you.

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:50.298
I do like your sculpture though.

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:53.468
Love, Connor.

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:23.758
Paul.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.099
Paul!

01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:36.904
Paul!

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.278
I wanna talk to you!

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:10.371
You can't leave
me here like this.

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:14.008
You can't leave me here!

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:17.612
Don't you leave me here!

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:40.935
Shit!

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:27.281
Hi, it's me.

01:16:28.483 --> 01:16:29.617
No, I'm lost.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.420
Okay.

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:38.793
You sure you're okay?

01:16:38.795 --> 01:16:41.329
Yeah, I just, my wrist.

01:16:41.331 --> 01:16:44.165
We can go get
that checked out.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.272
I hope he ran away.
