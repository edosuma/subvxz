WEBVTT

00:04.395 --> 00:06.658
- Peralta, looks like
an old friend of yours

00:06.702 --> 00:08.443
is back in town.
- Who?

00:08.486 --> 00:10.314
That guy Neil that you
bunked with at sleepaway camp?

00:10.358 --> 00:12.142
- Oh, Neil from camp
was the best.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.796
He could pick up a milk carton
with his butt cheeks.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.406
He was so funny.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.321
- You know who else was funny?
Bill Cosby.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.454
- Charles, will you relax?
You're gonna love Neil.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.021
- It's not Neil.
Why would it be Neil?

00:21.064 --> 00:23.284
It's Doug Judy.
- Oh, right.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.633
Someone we all know
in a police capacity.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.417
That makes more sense.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.550
- Someone's using his
signature move to steal cars,

00:28.593 --> 00:30.160
plugging in to the OBD port

00:30.204 --> 00:32.075
and reprogramming
the immobilizer module.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.511
- That's Doug Judy's MO,
but it's not him.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.209
He told me he went legit.
- That's what he told you

00:35.252 --> 00:37.167
last time too,
before he screwed you over.

00:37.211 --> 00:38.734
- Yeah, but he returned
the diamonds to me eventually,

00:38.777 --> 00:40.170
and it turned out
that was the only way

00:40.214 --> 00:41.519
to get Giggle Pig
off the streets.

00:41.563 --> 00:42.564
Wait, I may be confusing
our adventures.

00:42.607 --> 00:44.174
What year was the cruise?

00:44.218 --> 00:45.828
- Dude's a criminal.
People don't change.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.612
- Ever heard of Bruce Banner,
the Incredible Hulk?

00:47.656 --> 00:49.092
You might want to talk
to his shirts and pants

00:49.136 --> 00:51.442
about people not changing.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.357
- Well, I want to ask Doug Judy
some questions.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.706
You have his number?

00:54.750 --> 00:56.404
- I always make contact
through his mom.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.058
I'll put you in touch with her,
but remember,

00:58.101 --> 01:00.190
she thinks I'm his assistant
Mangy Carl,

01:00.234 --> 01:02.192
and he's a famous architect
who's designing

01:02.236 --> 01:04.368
LeBron James' new school
for black astronauts.

01:05.717 --> 01:08.111
- Hello, Mrs. Judy?

01:08.155 --> 01:10.331
I'm looking for your son,
the architect.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.811
Yes, I'm from...
black NASA.

01:12.855 --> 01:13.812
Is that a thing?

01:13.856 --> 01:16.206
- Oh, my. I didn't know.

01:16.250 --> 01:19.383
I understand.
Good-bye.

01:19.427 --> 01:22.256
So Doug Judy
will not be coming in.

01:22.299 --> 01:23.257
- What?
Why not?

01:23.300 --> 01:25.128
Oh, I see.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.608
He is dead.

01:46.671 --> 01:49.500
Wow, I don't know how to deal
with all these emotions, Terry.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.459
No one I've been close with
has ever died before.

01:51.502 --> 01:54.288
No tragic accidents to friends.
All my grandparents are alive.

01:54.331 --> 01:55.767
- How did you deal
when Hodor died?

01:55.811 --> 01:58.422
- Not well, Terry.
Why would you bring that up?

01:58.466 --> 02:00.642
- Carl?
Mangy Carl?

02:00.685 --> 02:02.731
- Yes. That is me.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.776
- I'm Trudy Judy,
Doug's sister.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.343
This is our aunt Patrice.

02:06.387 --> 02:07.736
I'm so glad you could make it.

02:07.779 --> 02:09.346
Doug really loved you.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.480
- Oh, he talked about me?
- Oh, all the time.

02:12.523 --> 02:15.439
He was so afraid he'd fall back
into your old life.

02:15.483 --> 02:17.137
Doug made Mangy Carl
an assistant

02:17.180 --> 02:18.573
at the architecture firm.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.618
He rescued him
from a life on the streets.

02:20.662 --> 02:23.230
- Yeah, I was down on my luck,
not a penny to my name.

02:23.273 --> 02:24.535
- You were selling your body
for money.

02:24.579 --> 02:25.710
- Did Doug tell you that?

02:25.754 --> 02:27.277
- He said all your teeth
fell out,

02:27.321 --> 02:28.800
and your mouth was just
a rotten hole.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.628
- 100% accurate.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.761
- Plus you were sick from
those back-alley butt implants.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.806
- Had to have 'em.
- Carl thought a plumper rump

02:34.850 --> 02:36.939
would help him get his
every night.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.680
- Yeah, I remember having
that thought.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.899
- But the doctor just put
a bunch of mulch up there,

02:40.943 --> 02:42.945
and it got all infected.
- Dark days.

02:42.988 --> 02:46.296
-  I'm sorry.
It's just so sweet.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.951
- The mulch thing?
- No, how Doug saved him.

02:48.994 --> 02:51.954
Doug was always taking people
under his wing.

02:51.997 --> 02:54.304
Doug said you have
a beautiful voice.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.697
- Oh, he did?
Well, I...

02:55.740 --> 02:57.394
♪ Suppose that's true

02:57.438 --> 02:59.440
- Would you want to sing a song
for us?

02:59.483 --> 03:00.919
- What a nice thought,
but you know what,

03:00.963 --> 03:02.486
I don't have anything prepared.

03:02.530 --> 03:03.966
- Okay, well,
if you don't want to sing,

03:04.009 --> 03:05.794
you could just tell us
the inspiring story

03:05.837 --> 03:08.666
of how Doug saved you
from being a mulch-butt ho.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.539
- I would like to sing a song
in honor of my dear friend

03:11.582 --> 03:12.931
Doug Judy.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.846
- Oh, nothing better
after a long shift

03:14.890 --> 03:16.587
than coming to Shaw's.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.633
It's like Cheers, where
everybody knows your name.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.287
- A place where everybody
knows your name is hell.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.680
You're describing hell.
- Guys, guys, guys.

03:22.724 --> 03:23.986
Are those...

03:24.029 --> 03:25.422
all: Firefighters.

03:25.466 --> 03:26.728
- Hey, what's going on?

03:26.771 --> 03:28.382
Why is the FDNY in our cop bar?

03:28.425 --> 03:29.731
- We needed a new place,

03:29.774 --> 03:31.646
since our bar, O'Brien's,
burned down.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.387
- You couldn't put that out?
- They probably started it.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.258
Most arsonists turn out
to be firefighters.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.260
- That's not true,
though it is very common,

03:37.304 --> 03:38.696
and definitely what happened
in this case.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.002
- I'm surprised you guys
even want to come here

03:40.045 --> 03:41.482
since you have to take
the stairs.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.353
I know how much you like
sliding on poles.

03:43.397 --> 03:44.789
- We don't like sliding
on poles.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.835
We do it to save lives.
It's dangerous.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.358
You can ask my best friend
Steve.

03:48.402 --> 03:50.317
Oh, no, wait,
you can't, actually,

03:50.360 --> 03:51.796
because he's dead.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.363
Tripped through a pole hole,
broke his neck.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.799
- That's horrible.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.714
- Sorry, but this is
a firefighter bar now.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.890
Although we might want to make
some changes to the decor.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.849
I'm thinking some old-timey
pressure gauges,

04:00.892 --> 04:02.242
maybe an autographed photo

04:02.285 --> 04:03.939
of Denis Leary
from "Rescue Me."

04:03.982 --> 04:06.376

- Wouldn't I?

That's psychotic.

I'm so sorry.

Did one of them turn out
to be an arsonist

04:45.937 --> 04:47.722
and burn down their own bar?
- Actually, yes.

04:47.765 --> 04:48.984
- So predictable.
But why did you call me?

04:49.027 --> 04:50.507
There's nothing I can do
about this.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.422

Everyone listens to you.

04:53.989 --> 04:54.946
I'm not sure I'd want to.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.948
This place is a hovel.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.473
The only wine they serve
is from the Delaware Water Gap.

04:59.516 --> 05:00.952
It's called "Charbonnay."

05:00.996 --> 05:02.911
- But this is our bar,
and it has been forever.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.086
- Change is a good thing.

05:04.129 --> 05:05.696
- Just yesterday,
you were ranting

05:05.740 --> 05:07.611
about the Philharmonic
adding a second piccolo.

05:07.655 --> 05:08.917
- It's too many.
It'll muddle the sound.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.005
- I'm sorry I brought it up.

05:10.048 --> 05:11.963
- Look, we can find a new bar

05:12.007 --> 05:13.400
that's not beneath us.

05:13.443 --> 05:14.836
What about Bel Vino?

05:14.879 --> 05:16.620
They've got a great selection
of Italian reds,

05:16.664 --> 05:17.839
and your feet don't stick
to the floor

05:17.882 --> 05:19.623
if you stand in one place
too long.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.799
- Fine. If you're not gonna do
anything, then I will.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.584
Hank, you got to get rid
of these hose humpers.

05:23.627 --> 05:24.628
It's them or us.
- Look, guys,

05:24.672 --> 05:25.673
I don't want to take sides.

05:25.716 --> 05:27.327
I just want to make money.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.111
- Then keep it a cop bar.
We drink like crazy.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.461

the tragedy we experience

05:31.505 --> 05:33.376
on a daily basis, son.

05:33.420 --> 05:36.510
- Oh, yeah? We experience
plenty of tragedy too.

05:36.553 --> 05:37.989
We lose a man a year
to the pole hole.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.687
- How about this?

05:39.730 --> 05:42.646
If it's about money,
let's just have a drink-off.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.909
Whoever racks up
the biggest tab by closing time

05:44.953 --> 05:46.389

My guys can handle that.

but I think I'm back

Should we get lunch?
- I would love a cheesesteak.

06:23.426 --> 06:24.949

thing, probably 'cause...

You know who Stefano Lucas is?

06:33.480 --> 06:35.046
- The arms dealer?

06:35.090 --> 06:37.048

on me, so I had to disappear.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.007
- Why does Stefano Lucas
want you dead?

06:39.050 --> 06:40.487
- His favorite Ferrari
got stolen,

06:40.530 --> 06:42.053
and for some reason
he thinks I did it.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.533
- Probably because
someone's been jacking cars

06:43.577 --> 06:44.969
all over Brooklyn
using your MO.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.449
- Oh, my God.
Jake, are you saying

06:46.493 --> 06:47.755
what I think you're saying?
- Yes.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.931
You have a copycat.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.672
I didn't think I'd accomplished
enough in my career for this.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.064

06:53.108 --> 06:55.023
- It just feels so good
to be seen, you know?

06:55.066 --> 06:57.025
- Wait. The only way
to catch a copycat

06:57.068 --> 06:59.157
is to team up
with the original criminal.

06:59.201 --> 07:01.072
- I'm back on the force!
Give me a gun.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.553
- No! There is no copycat.
You did it.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.468
- Not me.
I'm living that straight life.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.688
- Terry refuses to believe it.
He thinks people can't change.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.080
- Tell that to Bruce Banner's
pants and shirt.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.517
- That's what I said.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.779
- Doug Judy,
you're under arrest.

07:11.822 --> 07:14.564
- What? Sarge?

07:14.608 --> 07:16.827
You are really bringing down
the vibe at this funeral.

07:19.308 --> 07:21.005
- What the hell is that?

07:21.049 --> 07:22.616
- Jake got me this disguise

07:22.659 --> 07:24.487
so some criminal doesn't see me
in here and tell Stefano.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.533
- Okay, but why is Jake
also wearing them?

07:26.576 --> 07:29.144
- Uh, because it looks
super cool, Sarge.

07:29.187 --> 07:31.189
We look like the hot twins
from "The Matrix."

07:32.800 --> 07:34.541
- We are getting aggravated.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.499
- You look like Milli Vanilli.
- Ooh! I call Vanilli.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.327
- Ah, I want to be Nilli,
but you got it.

07:38.370 --> 07:39.633
- He's the best one.
- You know it's true.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.461
- So did you check out
Judy's alibi?

07:41.504 --> 07:44.072
- Yes, and surprisingly,
it checks out.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.204
Last Saturday night,
Doug was deejaying

07:46.248 --> 07:47.728
Joshy Greenbaum's bar mitzvah.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.381
- That was a wild party.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.035
Auntie Karen is a freak.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.515
- Judy, you deejay
bar mitzvahs?

07:52.559 --> 07:54.343
- Best gig I ever had.
No one likes hip-hop more

07:54.386 --> 07:55.649
than a 13-year-old Jewish boy.

07:55.692 --> 07:58.173
- Mm. So true.
- I'm not buying it.

07:58.216 --> 07:59.696
Probably stealing cash
off the gift table.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.742
- Sarge, come on.
He has an alibi.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.787
Let's just team up
and try and catch the copycat.

08:03.831 --> 08:05.310
A thousand push-ups.

08:05.354 --> 08:06.790
It's something Rosa and I
used to say.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.662
It just means trust me.
If Judy's a criminal,

08:08.705 --> 08:10.664
I'll do a thousand push-ups,
and since you're so confident,

08:10.707 --> 08:12.404
if you're wrong,
you can do 'em.

08:12.448 --> 08:14.189
- And a thousand push-ups?
That's a lot to you?

08:14.232 --> 08:15.538
- You go to hell, Terry.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.235
- Make it 100,000 push-ups,
and I'm in.

08:17.279 --> 08:19.063
- Obviously I can't do
that much exercise,

08:19.107 --> 08:21.152
but it doesn't matter, because
Doug Judy is telling the truth,

08:21.196 --> 08:22.327
right, Judy?
- I got you, baby.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.112
- So fine.
100,000 push-ups.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.548
You happy, Sarge?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.332
Great. Now, Doug...
- You never call me Doug.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.769
- Yeah, well,
you called me Jake earlier.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.205
I thought we were switching
to first names.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.423
- I was thinking
the same exact thing!

08:31.467 --> 08:33.164
I was like,
"Why not call him Jake?"

08:33.208 --> 08:34.383
- We're bonding, man.
- 'Cause he's so official.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.343
- But it's chill now.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.476
So, Doug...
- Yes, Jake?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.783
- Now that we know the copycat
is using your playbook,

08:42.826 --> 08:45.133
if you were still in the game--
which you're not,

08:45.176 --> 08:47.570
we all agree--
what would your next move be?

08:47.614 --> 08:49.485
- It's fight night at Barclays.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.400
No sport attracts
more ultra-wealthy people

08:51.443 --> 08:53.097
with super-nice cars
than boxing.

08:53.141 --> 08:55.578
- Really? What about the sport
of hunting man?

08:55.622 --> 08:57.406
- You got me.
- That's not a thing.

08:57.449 --> 08:58.581
- Right. So should we just
start at Barclays then?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.061
- Great.
But first, we got to make

09:00.104 --> 09:01.758
a quick little pit stop
on the way.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.064
- What? Where?

09:10.245 --> 09:12.116
- Okay, here are the rules
to the contest.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.596
If you order a drink,

09:13.640 --> 09:15.598
it must be fully consumed
before you order another.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.253
Each team's tab
will be tracked on that board.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.472
We don't want anyone getting
alcohol poisoning,

09:20.516 --> 09:22.126
so if you throw up,
you're disqualified.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.432
- I never throw up.

09:23.475 --> 09:24.651
I just tell my stomach
to deal with it.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.348
My body is terrified of me.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.697
- Guys, there's no way
we can win.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.569
There's nine of them
and six of us.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.614
- Five of you.
I'm going home.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.485
Although perhaps I'll stop
at Bel Vino on the way,

09:33.529 --> 09:34.617
have a glass of Sancerre.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.358
Might even try
the quince paste

09:36.401 --> 09:39.100
if I'm feeling...naughty.

09:39.143 --> 09:40.623
- You're really gonna let
these firefighters

09:40.667 --> 09:42.277
take Shaw's from us?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.453
Think of all the celebrations
we've had here,

09:44.496 --> 09:46.629
all the times Terry has yelled
"Nine-Nine!"

09:46.673 --> 09:47.674
- I hate it when he says that.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.501
He should say, "Cheers

09:49.545 --> 09:50.677
to the Ninety-Ninth Precinct!"

09:51.721 --> 09:53.462
- We shouldn't be here.

09:53.505 --> 09:54.898
- If you're worried
that someone will recognize me

09:54.942 --> 09:56.552
and find out I'm still alive,
they won't.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.293
There's not too many
hardened criminals

09:58.336 --> 10:00.295
at Justin Friedman's
bar mitzvah.

10:00.338 --> 10:03.428
Although there is a murderer
on the loose,

10:03.472 --> 10:05.648
'cause Kevin Goldman is killing
those dance moves!

10:05.692 --> 10:06.823
Get it, Kevin!

10:06.867 --> 10:08.564
That's the floss.
He's flossing.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.479
- It's just that we should be
at Barclays already.

10:10.522 --> 10:11.698
The fights are starting soon.

10:11.741 --> 10:13.700
- Rich guys never show up
on time.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.876
Besides, I promised Justin
I'd be here.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.225
What up, J-Smooth!

10:19.836 --> 10:22.230
- Gone straight, my ass.
I got you, Doug Judy.

10:22.273 --> 10:23.710
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

10:23.753 --> 10:25.581
- Something felt wrong,
stopping for this bar mitzvah,

10:25.625 --> 10:27.278
so I sent
some plainclothes officers

10:27.322 --> 10:28.845
to watch the lots at Barclays.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.847
They just caught the copycat.
- I don't understand.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.632
If anything,
that proves Judy's innocent.

10:32.675 --> 10:33.894
He's been standing here with us
the whole time.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.636
- Which was his plan!
Establish an alibi,

10:36.679 --> 10:38.420
so his partner can go off
stealing cars.

10:38.463 --> 10:39.595
- I don't have a partner.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.683
Whoever this is,
I promise you,

10:40.727 --> 10:41.858
I do not know him.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.295
- Actually, Doug,
I think you do.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.688
- Oh, my God.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.211
all: Trudy Judy!

10:49.474 --> 10:51.128
- You still want to pretend you
had nothing to do with this?

10:51.172 --> 10:53.087
- I didn't,
and she didn't either.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.131
Trudy Judy's not a car thief.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.524
Trudy Judy's an angel.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.004
She's putting herself through
nursing school.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.527
And nurses are the best
of our society.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.050
Name one bad nurse.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.878
- Nurse Ratched.
Kathy Bates in "Misery."

11:01.922 --> 11:03.358
Nurse Jackie
had a pill problem.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.403
- Okay, damn, you got a lot
of real good examples

11:05.447 --> 11:07.231
off the top of your head.
You believe me, right, Jake?

11:07.275 --> 11:08.885
- I mean, the fact pattern's
not great,

11:08.929 --> 11:10.147
but Trudy did seem very nice
when I met her.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.366
- You trying
to get your freak on

11:11.409 --> 11:12.976
with my sister?
- What? No.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.412
- I see you looking
at Trudy Judy's booty.

11:14.456 --> 11:15.892
- I am not looking
at Trudy Judy's booty.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.067
- Oh, you don't think
she's a cutie?

11:17.111 --> 11:18.416
Don't be snooty.
- She's a beauty,

11:18.460 --> 11:20.114
but I'm on duty.
- And you're married.

11:20.157 --> 11:21.376
- Well, yeah,
but that doesn't rhyme.

11:21.419 --> 11:22.377
- Sorry, I just get
so overprotective.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.900
She's such a good kid.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.772
I guarantee you,
she didn't steal those cars.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.948
- We caught her sitting in a
Bentley with a power amplifier

11:27.991 --> 11:30.254
and a homemade override
plugged into the CAN bus.

11:30.298 --> 11:32.082
- Yeah, she guilty.

11:32.126 --> 11:34.215
- I can't believe you made us
think you were dead.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.564
- I can't believe
you're out here stealing cars.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.261
That's for lowlifes.
- You steal cars.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.350
- And I'm a lowlife.
A gorgeous, charming,

11:39.394 --> 11:40.482
super smart lowlife
beloved by all.

11:40.525 --> 11:41.918
- I'm sorry, Dougie.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.093
I was falling behind
on my student loans.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.442
I had to do something.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.096
- Guys, if you weren't
working together,

11:46.140 --> 11:47.358
how did she know
all your signature moves?

11:47.402 --> 11:48.795
- I found some of Doug's
old notebooks.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.100
- Those are notes
for my memoir.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.885
- Memoir?
Do you have title ideas yet?

11:51.928 --> 11:55.062
- I was just gonna call it
"The Pontiac Bandit..."

11:56.541 --> 11:57.891
- Oh, is that it?
- Yeah.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.457
- Okay.
- I hated stealing cars.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.329
I was gonna stop as soon
as nursing school was paid off,

12:01.372 --> 12:03.244
I swear.
It was a mistake.

12:03.287 --> 12:04.985
- That's good enough for me.
Come on, Trudy, let's go home.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.030
- That's not really
how arresting works.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.292
She's going to jail.
- Wait, wait, wait.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.859
What if we get you
a bigger fish?

12:09.903 --> 12:11.556
What if we can get you Stefano?
- Who?

12:11.600 --> 12:15.125
- That cherry red 1961 Ferrari
250GT California you took

12:15.169 --> 12:17.040
belongs to a guy named
Stefano Lucas.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.955
He thinks I did it,
and now he wants to kill me.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.348
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.915
- It's all good.
You have the car,

12:21.958 --> 12:23.873
so I call him,
tell him I'm not dead,

12:23.917 --> 12:25.527
say I want to give him
his car back,

12:25.570 --> 12:27.877
arrange a drop, and these guys
take him down or die trying.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.357
- That is interesting.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.141
Stefano almost never comes out
in public.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.056
It would be a huge collar
for the Nine-Nine.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.320
What do you say, Sarge?
100,000 push-ups?

12:36.364 --> 12:39.019
- Fine. If you deliver Stefano,
I'll talk to the DA

12:39.062 --> 12:40.629
about a reduced sentence
for your sister.

12:40.672 --> 12:43.327
- Thank you so much.
There's just one problem.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.633
I don't have the car.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.374
I already handed it off
to a fence.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.855
- Oh, Judy, Judy,
you screwed me.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.596
- Four hours left.
We're down $58.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.511
Amy, where you at?
- Four drinks.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.513
- What's four-drink Amy again?
- Why don't you come over here

12:55.557 --> 12:57.907
and find out?
- Right, Horny Amy.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.604
It feels like you should retire
that one for the MeToo era.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.868
- Why don't you come over here
and make me?

13:01.911 --> 13:02.912
- All right, there's only
one thing left to do.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.218
- Drink faster.

13:04.261 --> 13:05.306
- Set a bunch of fires
throughout the city.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.395
Mine's better.
- No!

13:07.438 --> 13:09.136
We can do this.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.833
Things seem bleak now,

13:10.877 --> 13:13.575
but the night is always darkest
before the dawn.

13:13.618 --> 13:16.186
This is Shaw's.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.406
We've had weddings here,

13:18.449 --> 13:20.016
and funerals.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.976
Shaw's is part of our family,

13:23.019 --> 13:25.630
because that is what we are.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.154
A family.

13:27.197 --> 13:29.634
And we're not just Amy and Rosa

13:29.678 --> 13:31.201
and Hitchcock and--

13:39.601 --> 13:41.864
- So the fence, Dallas,
he works in there.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.257
- I don't like him.
My rule?

13:43.300 --> 13:44.345
Never trust anyone
named after a city.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.607
- What about Orlando Bloom?

13:45.650 --> 13:47.217
- I never thought about him
being named

13:47.261 --> 13:49.306
after the city before,
and his last name is Bloom?

13:49.350 --> 13:51.352
Wait a minute. Did we just
realize something crazy?

13:51.395 --> 13:53.267
- No, everyone knows
it's a crazy name.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.659
Now can we just focus
on the meet-up?

13:54.703 --> 13:56.574
- Fine.
- All right, Dallas is creepy

13:56.618 --> 13:59.142
and paranoid, and he really
freaked me out that last time.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.014
I don't want to go in alone.
- Don't worry, kid.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.624
I'll be there
right next to you, as always.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.018
- Aw. Sarge, why don't you say
stuff like that to me?

14:05.061 --> 14:08.108
- No, look, I do not trust
the Judys going anywhere alone.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.892
Doug, you stay with Jake.
I'll go in with Trudy.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.241
I just need a cover story.

14:11.285 --> 14:12.416
- We could say
that you're my boyfriend.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.896
- No. No, no, no,
I don't want

14:13.940 --> 14:15.463
my little sister
fake-dating some pervert.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.073
- What?
Why am I a pervert?

14:17.117 --> 14:18.683
- Uh, have you ever met
a nice, normal guy

14:18.727 --> 14:20.468
that wears suspenders
every day?

14:20.511 --> 14:21.599
What kind of person
has to tie their pants down

14:21.643 --> 14:23.253
to keep them from flying off?

14:23.297 --> 14:24.472
- That's not what suspenders
are for, man.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.256
- Guys, we don't have time

14:26.300 --> 14:28.084
to figure out what suspenders
are for, all right?

14:28.128 --> 14:29.956
Now, Trudy,
this is undercover work.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.740
It can be very intense.
Are you sure you can handle it?

14:31.783 --> 14:34.264
- I mean, I'll do my best.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.440
- Who's this?
- This is Deion. He's my man.

14:36.484 --> 14:39.269
Ask me another question,
you simple little barn animal.

14:39.313 --> 14:40.705
- Okay, so she can handle it.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.272
- Why is your boyfriend here?

14:42.316 --> 14:44.448
- Who said boyfriend?
Deion and I freak,

14:44.492 --> 14:45.754
then he shuts
his pretty little mouth

14:45.797 --> 14:47.495
and lets me handle my business.

14:47.538 --> 14:48.713
- I don't like the direction
this is going.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.454
- Easy.
She's just playing a part.

14:50.498 --> 14:51.934
- Pretty big age difference
here.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.631
Where'd you guys meet?
- The club.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.198
Deion was a bouncer,

14:55.242 --> 14:58.071
and I told him I wanted him
to bounce on me.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.420
- Oh, what is that?

14:59.463 --> 15:00.725
Is she rubbing on his mic?

15:00.769 --> 15:02.466
- The mic that was taped
to his chest?

15:02.510 --> 15:03.946
- You should feel these.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.643
They're like
two baseball bases.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.167
Make 'em pop, daddy.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.603
- Daddy's not sure
this is the time.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.126
- Do it, daddy!

15:10.170 --> 15:12.259
Ooh, ow!
Ooh, ow!

15:12.302 --> 15:13.651
- Get your hands off her,
pervert!

15:13.695 --> 15:15.436
- Judy! Judy!
I tried to stop him.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.046
- That's my baby sister
you're caressing.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.440
- What? How can I caress her
with my pecs?

15:19.483 --> 15:21.050
- Look at those things.
They got thumbs.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.052
- Guys, guys, stop!
Where is Dallas?

15:23.096 --> 15:24.401
- I think he got spooked
and ran away.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.316
- Good job, Doug Judy.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.492
You just cost your sister
a chance at a reduced sentence.

15:28.536 --> 15:31.539
- Oh, no!
Why is my tone so playful?

15:31.582 --> 15:33.323
Why is there a twinkle
in my eye?

15:33.367 --> 15:39.677
Because I just found our
1961 Ferrari 250GT California.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.114
- Oh, ho, ho!

15:41.157 --> 15:43.203
Ladies and gents
and pervert Terry,

15:43.246 --> 15:44.813
we are in business.

15:44.856 --> 15:47.163
Sorry, Sarge, I got caught up
in the moment there.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.035
- Guys, I threw up.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.514
- Oh, man, it's over.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.168
We need a miracle.
- I'm here.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.604
- Captain Holt!
How are you here?

15:53.648 --> 15:55.345
- You called me.
You didn't stop calling me.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.434
- I didn't call you.
Look.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.262
- You left 17 voicemails.

15:59.306 --> 16:00.524
Here's one.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.526
- Holt!
You got to come save us.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.354
We need a lie to get you here.

16:04.398 --> 16:05.529
Charles, what should I say?

16:05.573 --> 16:07.096
- That I got shot in the face.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.706
Ooh, and tell him
to bring pizza.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.360
- Whoo!
Crampon Holt!

16:10.404 --> 16:11.579
We're losing.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.668
Yeah!
- Why are you dancing?

16:13.711 --> 16:15.496
- Oh, I was up
to nine-drink Amy,

16:15.539 --> 16:17.324
who speaks French,

16:17.367 --> 16:19.369
and then I hurl--

16:19.413 --> 16:21.502
I hurl--
hurled.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.373
- What she's trying to say
is that she vomited,

16:23.417 --> 16:25.201
and now she's back down
to three-drink Amy,

16:25.245 --> 16:26.333
or Amy Dance Pants.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.638
- You know it.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.466
- My God.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.468
Hitchcock, are you the only
person still making sense?

16:31.512 --> 16:33.209
- Yeah. It's bad.

16:33.253 --> 16:35.690
- So are you gonna make us
give up, Clappin?

16:35.733 --> 16:37.387
Or are you here to tell us
to stop?

16:37.431 --> 16:39.041
- No, I'm here to help you win.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.738
- What is happening?
Why is this?

16:40.782 --> 16:42.523
- It's something you said
on one of your voicemails,

16:42.566 --> 16:44.307
after you had sung
the entirety of a song

16:44.351 --> 16:46.048
called "Shake Whatcha
Mama Gave Ya."

16:46.092 --> 16:47.745
You thought you had hung up,
but you hadn't.

16:47.789 --> 16:51.532
- Anyway, bye-bye.
What am I doing calling him?

16:51.575 --> 16:54.187
He doesn't care about us
or what we want.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.058
- When I heard that,
I was shaken to my core.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.755
I thought this bar
was beneath me,

16:57.799 --> 17:00.410
but what was actually beneath
me was my own behavior.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.412
I had turned my back on--
- Holt!

17:02.456 --> 17:04.110
We do not have time for this.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.589
Just drinky, drinky!

17:05.633 --> 17:10.072
- Hank, bring me
a Charbonnay.

17:10.116 --> 17:13.162
- All right, Stefano
should be here any minute.

17:13.206 --> 17:14.642
- I just want to thank you guys
so much for helping me.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.165
I don't deserve your kindness.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.601
- Hey, don't be so hard
on yourself.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.473
We all make bad decisions
when we're younger.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.475
I was once in a flash mob.
- Ew.

17:21.518 --> 17:22.780
- Something's off about this.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.391
I don't like leaving Judy
out there alone.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.653
- Relax, we have a tracker
on the car,

17:25.696 --> 17:27.263
a tracker on Doug Judy,

17:27.307 --> 17:29.396
and ESU has the entire area
surrounded.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.267
It's gonna be fine.
- We got movement.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.269
- Okay, everyone,
to your positions.

17:33.313 --> 17:34.531
On my signal.

17:34.575 --> 17:37.186
Hold. Hold.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.883
Hold.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.581
Sorry, I started holding
too soon.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.626
Let's start over.
Hold.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.324
Hold.

17:44.367 --> 17:45.847
And...

17:47.501 --> 17:49.633
Everyone, stop holding!
Go, go, go, go!

17:52.158 --> 17:54.203
- Where is he?
Where is he?

17:54.247 --> 17:55.770
- Got him.
They got Stefano.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.902
- No, not Stefano.
The Pontiac Bandit.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.730
Where is--
- Doug Judy here.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.080
Y'all see that car blow up?

18:01.123 --> 18:02.429
- Yeah, we did.
Why did you do that?

18:02.472 --> 18:03.952
- You think I did that?

18:03.995 --> 18:05.736
Doug Judy does not work
with fire.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.390
- Yeah, he's like the Hound
from "Game of Thrones."

18:07.434 --> 18:09.305
- I am like the Hound.
And you're my Arya.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.959
- Right?
- Guys!

18:11.002 --> 18:13.440
If Doug Judy didn't blow up
the car, who did?

18:15.268 --> 18:17.313
all: Trudy Judy.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.277
- Damn, sir, you took
that Charbonnay to the house.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.105
How you feeling?
- Let me take stock.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.932
My equilibrium is askew,

18:27.976 --> 18:30.109
my vision is partially
impaired,

18:30.152 --> 18:31.936
and I'm clearly slurring
my words.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.025
To put a fine point on it,
your boy is turnt.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.158
- Well, well, well,
there's only a minute left,

18:36.202 --> 18:38.117
and you are six bucks down.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.379
I don't think you guys
are gonna make it.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.207
- Hank, another Charb.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.122
- This one's hot.
It was sitting on the radiator.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.390
- He's never gonna make it.
- Yes, he will.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.262
Just don't breathe.
Let the liquid into your lungs.

18:55.264 --> 18:59.442
- Five, four, three, two...

18:59.486 --> 19:00.965
Closing time!
Cops win!

19:04.926 --> 19:08.364
- All right, fine,
the bar is yours.

19:08.408 --> 19:11.802
But we're keeping this!

19:11.846 --> 19:13.195
Come on.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.241
- Before we all go home
and pass out,

19:15.284 --> 19:18.200
I want to say how sorry I am
that I deserted you earlier.

19:18.244 --> 19:21.247
I want you to know that I care
about you all so very much,

19:21.290 --> 19:22.552
each and every one of you.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.120
Boyle, Santiago, Diaz,
Hitchcock...

19:28.123 --> 19:30.125
- All right, I have officers
looking for her.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.909
She was on foot.
She couldn't have gone far.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.042
- This is her.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.218
Where are you, Trudy?
- In the wind, Dougie.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.177
- Okay, that's a cool thing to
say, but what are you doing?

19:38.220 --> 19:39.395
They were gonna reduce
your charges.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.092
- Reduced charges
are still charges,

19:41.136 --> 19:42.485
and I can't go to prison.

19:42.529 --> 19:45.532
There are no dudes there,
and I need to smush!

19:45.575 --> 19:47.186
- Trudy!
- Oh, grow up, Doug.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.188
I'm an adult woman
who's horny all the time.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.451
- What is going on?
- Oh, are you judging me, ho?

19:51.494 --> 19:53.017
- Trudy, running from the cops
is a felony.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.149
That means no more
nursing school.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.368
- Good. It sucked.

19:55.411 --> 19:56.586
I only went to, like,
one class.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.197
- What?
- It was boring as hell.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.155
So then I started running
Internet scams.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.417
Then there was identity theft.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.114
I was Queen Latifah for a bit.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.029
Then Lil' Kim.
That was less believable.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.597
But then I found
your old notebooks.

20:07.641 --> 20:10.165
How come you never told me
how much fun car thieving is?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.601
- Because I didn't want you
to fall in love with it.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.212
- Wait, I'm confused.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.909
When did you put the bomb
in the Ferrari?

20:14.952 --> 20:16.432
- I didn't do it.
Dallas did.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.434
And Dallas isn't some criminal
I'm afraid of.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.393
He's my employee.
Say what's up, Dallas.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.612
- Wassup?
- Named after a city.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.223
- The hard part was
trying to figure out

20:24.266 --> 20:25.659
how to tell him my plan,
so then I came up

20:25.702 --> 20:27.182
with that whole
boyfriend thing,

20:27.226 --> 20:28.923
because I needed a distraction.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.664
I knew you'd rush in,
all weird and old-fashioned,

20:30.707 --> 20:32.231
try to protect my honor.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.407
- How can I caress her
with my pecs?

20:34.450 --> 20:36.235
- Look at those things.
They got thumbs.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.888
- I don't need you
to protect me, Doug.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.107
- You're my baby sister.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.369
I got to look out for you.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.676
- That's so sweet,
and also dumb.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.460
I'll see you at Christmas,
sucker!

20:44.504 --> 20:46.288
I love you, big bro.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.507
- Trudy!

20:47.550 --> 20:50.118
Man, I am gutted.
This is awful.

20:50.161 --> 20:52.033
Is this how you feel every time
I trick you?

20:52.076 --> 20:53.077
- Pretty much.
Yeah, it always hurts.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.470
- Wow, I'm sorry, man.

20:54.514 --> 20:55.993
It must be really hard
to hang out with me.

20:56.037 --> 20:56.994
- Well, it's a tough
relationship,

20:57.038 --> 20:58.431
but it's exciting.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.128
- Hey, Doug, I'm sorry
for not trusting you.

21:00.171 --> 21:01.434
Turns out you had nothing to do
with this.

21:01.477 --> 21:04.437
- Oh, so you admit
people can change.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.178
- Yes. Bruce Banner's pants
and shirt were correct.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.658
- You know what this means,
right?

21:08.702 --> 21:10.399
- 6,203.

21:10.443 --> 21:12.575
6,204.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.403
I am so glad I lost this bet.

21:14.447 --> 21:16.275
I never find time
for things I enjoy.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.276
- This is so unsatisfying.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.581
You're not even sweating.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.191
- It's too easy.
Get on my back, Jake.

21:20.235 --> 21:21.628
- No, I'm not--
- Get on my back, Jake!

21:21.671 --> 21:23.194
- Coming, strong man!

21:23.238 --> 21:25.196
- Fremulon.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.459
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
