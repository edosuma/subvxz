WEBVTT

00:07.791 --> 00:09.916
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:32.458 --> 00:33.458
Thank you.

00:39.875 --> 00:41.166
Catarina.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.375
Mommy's princess,

00:43.458 --> 00:48.291
look how many gifts
the tide has brought you, honey.

00:48.375 --> 00:49.208
-Huh?
-Honey.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.291
Unbelievable. Why so many?

00:51.375 --> 00:54.500
-Babe, you deserve the best.
-You're my greatest gift.

00:55.791 --> 00:58.125
Let me take this inside.

00:58.208 --> 00:59.083
Darling.

01:00.666 --> 01:03.041
-Can you take this inside, please?
-Sure.

01:03.750 --> 01:04.583
Thank you.

01:05.208 --> 01:07.208
So, where were we?

01:13.750 --> 01:14.666
It was surreal.

01:16.750 --> 01:20.333
You are-- Wait, don't say it.
Yasmin, right?

01:21.166 --> 01:23.500
I'm not crazy,
I checked everybody's profile.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.000
Conrado, Yasmin. Yasmin, Conrado.

01:26.083 --> 01:27.958
I haven't introduced myself. I'm Helena!

01:28.541 --> 01:31.000
I'm so anxious to meet the whole staff.

01:31.083 --> 01:34.291
I bet there are many hot tourists here.

01:34.375 --> 01:35.875
I'll look out for that.

01:36.875 --> 01:39.833
Welcome, newcomers.
Nice to meet you, I'm Vilma.

01:39.916 --> 01:41.125
-How are you?
-Vilma.

01:41.208 --> 01:44.250
Follow me. The hotel is super busy
with today's event.

01:44.333 --> 01:47.000
Be patient, okay?
I'll take you to your rooms now,

01:47.083 --> 01:49.541
and I'll explain everything tomorrow.

01:49.625 --> 01:51.000
-Okay.
-Shall we?

01:53.083 --> 01:54.833
Hey, newcomers!

01:54.916 --> 01:57.125
-Hello. Nice to meet you, guys!
-Hi.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.583
-I'm so glad you're here.
-How are you?

01:59.666 --> 02:01.375
They've just arrived.

02:01.458 --> 02:03.250
That's great,

02:03.333 --> 02:05.958
because the wait staff
we hired isn't here.

02:06.041 --> 02:08.208
So we'll need all hands on deck.

02:08.291 --> 02:12.000
If you don't mind,
we start today, learning as we go.

02:12.083 --> 02:13.125
-All right!
-Okay?

02:13.208 --> 02:14.583
-Sure.
-Great!

02:14.666 --> 02:17.791
-Hey, veterans! Our backup is here.
-Look, newcomers!

02:17.875 --> 02:21.041
-Hi, guys!
-See you later!

02:21.125 --> 02:21.958
-Bye.
-Good luck.

02:22.041 --> 02:24.750
The rooms are this way. Follow me, please.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.833
Thank you. Let's do this.

02:52.708 --> 02:57.291
Hey, pal! Two Black Russians
and a Manhattan. We're over there.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.458
Two Manhattans--

03:00.541 --> 03:01.500
-Conrado!
-Yes?

03:02.375 --> 03:07.666
Leave it to me. Listen, follow my lead
and you'll be fine, okay, bro? Come on.

03:07.750 --> 03:08.583
Here you go.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.125
-Hi.
-Hi, girls. Nice meeting you.

03:12.208 --> 03:16.125
I'm Marília. Helena, right?
Can you go get more gin, please?

03:16.208 --> 03:17.666
-It's right there.
-Sure.

03:18.833 --> 03:19.666
Yasmin,

03:20.208 --> 03:21.333
mission impossible.

03:22.416 --> 03:23.708
Watch the girly girl.

03:23.791 --> 03:25.708
Vilma said she can be difficult.

03:25.791 --> 03:27.166
-Oh God!
-Got it?

03:31.625 --> 03:32.666
Lights out.

03:34.791 --> 03:35.625
What the heck?

03:38.208 --> 03:40.833
Oh, no. Where is Vilma? Have you seen her?

03:43.291 --> 03:44.375
Hello.

03:45.541 --> 03:46.375
Excuse me.

03:47.291 --> 03:49.166
I need your attention, please,

03:50.583 --> 03:54.458
because the question
I'm about to ask is life-changing.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.083
For us.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.041
Catarina, will you marry me?

04:08.750 --> 04:10.208
Of course I will!

04:44.000 --> 04:45.041
I'm shocked.

04:46.416 --> 04:49.125
I can't believe I missed the proposal.

04:49.958 --> 04:50.833
Of all people.

04:54.041 --> 04:58.083
No, take this one, it's special.
Enjoy your last night as a single man.

04:59.083 --> 05:02.208
Choose one and go for it.
That one is really hot.

05:07.250 --> 05:09.333
Go, Rodrigo. Catarina won't see it.

05:16.208 --> 05:19.041
-Sis, have you seen Rodrigo?
-No.

05:19.125 --> 05:20.166
-Have you?
-No.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.875
I wanted to take a picture.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.708
-Noah, have you seen Rodrigo?
-Rodrigo?

05:28.500 --> 05:29.375
Thanks.

05:42.333 --> 05:43.458
Are you in a hurry?

06:12.416 --> 06:13.666
-Sis--
-Wait.

06:14.458 --> 06:15.333
Mom?

06:16.791 --> 06:18.833
What is it, honey? What happened?

06:18.916 --> 06:21.583
-You don't know what I just saw.
-What happened?

06:22.541 --> 06:23.958
I'm really confused.

06:24.041 --> 06:27.000
-This proposal was a mistake.
-Listen to me.

06:27.875 --> 06:31.291
You know your happiness
is everything to me, right?

06:32.166 --> 06:35.416
So listen to me.
I need you to marry Rodrigo.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.625
I'm going away in two days. And my MBA?

06:38.125 --> 06:40.791
MBA? You can take care of it later.

06:40.875 --> 06:43.541
Now you need to marry Rodrigo.
Tell me you get it.

06:43.625 --> 06:46.125
-You knew about the proposal.
-Tell me you get it.

06:46.208 --> 06:47.166
You knew, right?

06:47.916 --> 06:50.291
Look, I need to make a call.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.500
Look at me.

06:51.583 --> 06:54.583
Where's that beautiful smile?
Come on, Catarina!

06:55.083 --> 06:57.000
Yes. Very good.

07:03.125 --> 07:04.750
Can I have a drink, please?

07:06.875 --> 07:08.083
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

07:14.958 --> 07:16.625
POLICE

07:24.416 --> 07:26.375
-The police?
-What's going on?

07:46.416 --> 07:49.333
-What's happening?
-The police are taking her.

07:52.625 --> 07:55.250
I can't believe
I've found a single guy here.

07:56.916 --> 07:57.916
What is it?

08:00.541 --> 08:01.375
It's--

08:02.208 --> 08:03.041
Helena, right?

08:04.375 --> 08:05.750
Let's go back to the party.

08:06.541 --> 08:07.375
I'm sorry.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.250
-Cecília Trindade.
-Mom?

08:29.750 --> 08:32.208
You're under arrest for money laundering,

08:32.291 --> 08:34.541
tax evasion and active corruption.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.291
What the hell? Mom?

08:38.791 --> 08:40.916
Calm down. You'll have to stay here.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.625
Take care of my daughter. Vilma

08:45.916 --> 08:47.125
Please.

08:47.208 --> 08:48.625
Where are you going?

08:50.541 --> 08:52.125
What the hell is going on?

09:11.166 --> 09:14.708
And I thought the fiancé on a white horse
would be the climax.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.458
Fiancé?

09:18.541 --> 09:20.208
Yes. Here.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.500
Yeah. Wow!

09:25.000 --> 09:25.875
Awkward, right?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.375
Yasmin, have you seen a guitar case?

09:39.458 --> 09:40.583
No, I haven't.

09:44.250 --> 09:49.916
I THINK IT'S IN BAHIA

09:55.875 --> 09:56.708
Here you go.

09:57.458 --> 10:00.666
All bungalows are booked,
but you can stay here with us.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.166
-It's improvised but comfortable.
-Thanks.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.250
If you're hungry, help yourself.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.458
You can have anything in the fridge.

10:08.916 --> 10:09.750
Thank you.

10:11.250 --> 10:14.416
Honey, help me take
the uniforms to the office.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.250
We need to give them to the newcomers.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.666
We'll let you get some rest, okay?

10:21.250 --> 10:22.291
Try to sleep.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.041
Good night.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.666
MOM'S MOBILE

10:57.833 --> 11:01.833
<i>Your call's been forwarded to voicemail.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

11:14.250 --> 11:17.000
14 MISSED CALLS

12:20.750 --> 12:21.791
RODRIGO
24 MESSAGES

12:21.875 --> 12:23.208

ADD TO CART

CREDIT CARD DECLINED

15:27.500 --> 15:30.916
-What's going on?
-I don't know. Ask her.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.208
-She broke in.
-What?

15:32.291 --> 15:35.458
-You broke in.
-Quiet! Vilma is sleeping.

15:35.958 --> 15:39.416
I want to know what you're doing
in my living room at 3:00 a.m.,

15:39.500 --> 15:41.083
so I can go back to sleep.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.958
I was looking for a charger.
My phone died.

15:45.041 --> 15:46.208
And you, Yasmin?

15:47.625 --> 15:48.458
I--

15:49.625 --> 15:50.625
I--

15:58.291 --> 15:59.125
I don't know.

16:01.208 --> 16:02.333
Let's go back to bed.

16:14.375 --> 16:18.250
ARE YOU STILL WATCHING?

16:27.625 --> 16:31.500
Heleninha, a breakfast gift.
Your peanuts. Diego.

16:31.583 --> 16:34.000
-Catch it. Great. Your peanuts.
-Cool!

16:34.083 --> 16:35.500
And there's more.

16:37.083 --> 16:42.541
<i>Good morning, buenos días,</i>
<i>gutem morgen, bonjour, buongiorno.</i>

16:42.625 --> 16:44.458
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.750
Both sun and sea look amazing today.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.291
It's probably a Conchas Island's tribute

16:51.375 --> 16:54.333
to our new staff here at Maresia Hotel.

16:54.416 --> 16:58.666
Get ready, the summer season starts today.

16:58.750 --> 17:02.291
From what we've seen yesterday,
this summer will be wild.

17:02.375 --> 17:05.458
Conrado, you'll learn
that guests don't want to wait.

17:06.041 --> 17:09.250
So we need to be fast
with their luggage, okay?

17:09.333 --> 17:11.833
When you're done,
go straight to the stage.

17:11.916 --> 17:14.791
I listened to your demo.
You're a great singer.

17:14.875 --> 17:17.375
I've been practicing, learning.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.833
Marília, yoga classes all day.

17:20.916 --> 17:24.666
Conrado, the guitar case
at the bar yesterday, is it yours?

17:24.750 --> 17:25.916
-Yes.
-Miguel.

17:26.000 --> 17:26.833
Yes?

17:26.916 --> 17:29.458
You are taking the guests for a hike.

17:29.541 --> 17:31.875
Don't take shortcuts on your way back.

17:31.958 --> 17:33.250
-Come on, Maresia.
-Okay?

17:33.333 --> 17:36.333
You're making me look bad.
When did I let you down?

17:36.416 --> 17:37.625
-When?
-When did I?

17:38.208 --> 17:39.500
-When, right?
-When?

17:39.583 --> 17:40.708
When?

17:40.791 --> 17:41.666
Helena.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.291
-It's me.
-Take this.

17:43.375 --> 17:47.041
Sometimes, guests
end up drinking too much at the bar.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.541
Let me know if anyone misbehaves.

17:49.625 --> 17:51.750
-Okay.
-Okay? Diego.

17:51.833 --> 17:54.625
You'll be in charge of the boat rides.

17:54.708 --> 17:57.125
-Perfect.
-Finally, Miss Yasmin.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.958
You'll be at the reception,

18:00.041 --> 18:03.583
where guests have the hotel's first
and last impressions.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.458
That's what they'll remember.

18:07.833 --> 18:11.583
Guys, this is a special place
for me and Vilma.

18:11.666 --> 18:14.791
We take this recruitment process
very seriously,

18:14.875 --> 18:18.250
'cause the staff ends up being
like a family to us.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.791
So, welcome.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.041
And now, let's get to work.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.250
-Cool.
-Let's go.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.500
-Let's do it.
-Have a nice day, guys.

18:25.583 --> 18:26.500
Have a nice day.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.041
-Come, Diego.
-Maresia.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.291
Hi, Yasmin. Did you sleep well?

18:30.791 --> 18:32.791
Yes. Sure.

18:32.875 --> 18:34.458
And about yesterday,

18:35.250 --> 18:37.833
I was looking for the--

18:37.916 --> 18:40.708
I mean, the leaflets
about the right whales.

18:40.791 --> 18:42.916
I saw Vilma going in there.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.083
-I thought it was the office.
-The office.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.166
-I'm sorry.
-That's funny.

18:48.250 --> 18:51.166
Right whales are my favorite.

18:53.208 --> 18:56.291
-I'll get to work. Excuse me.
-Okay. Have a nice day.

18:57.333 --> 18:59.291
<i>Mom, look at my beautiful drawing.</i>

18:59.375 --> 19:02.250
<i>-Show it to Diego.</i>
-She's so cute.

19:05.291 --> 19:06.166
What is it?

19:07.666 --> 19:09.458
You know I'm chill, right?

19:09.958 --> 19:11.916
I don't want to pressure you,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.666
but we've been together
for almost a year. Right, Di?

19:17.916 --> 19:19.708
I need to ask you something.

19:19.791 --> 19:22.083
Sure, ask me anything.

19:22.875 --> 19:25.333
I want to know where we stand exactly.

19:29.291 --> 19:30.250
Think about it.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.875
Take your time. We'll talk later.

19:33.541 --> 19:34.416
Okay.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.583
Gimme two minutes.

19:36.125 --> 19:38.666
-I'm on my way. On the boat? Okay.
-Go.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.416
Yes, I'm rushing!

19:43.833 --> 19:46.375
Damn! I'm sorry.

19:48.125 --> 19:48.958
No problem.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.500
Have you ever stayed
this long away from your parents?

20:01.333 --> 20:02.791
We got here yesterday.

20:03.708 --> 20:04.583
That's true.

20:06.791 --> 20:07.708
It's my record.

20:12.125 --> 20:14.541
Yes. It must be a mistake.

20:14.625 --> 20:16.708
My card was declined yesterday.

20:16.791 --> 20:17.750
I want to know--

20:18.666 --> 20:20.750
It's been frozen by court order?

20:20.833 --> 20:22.166
My bank account, too?

20:22.250 --> 20:24.833
I'm Catarina, not Cecília.
Two different accounts.

20:24.916 --> 20:26.583
Trindade Vasconcelos, yes.

20:28.208 --> 20:30.625
What do you mean, bad credit?

20:33.000 --> 20:36.541
This is a mistake.
I'll figure it out and call you back.

20:36.625 --> 20:37.458
Thank you.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.291
Uncle, what did I do to deserve this?

20:55.375 --> 20:56.708
It's so unfair.

20:56.791 --> 20:59.458
They froze my cards, my bank account.

20:59.541 --> 21:01.666
I don't have a house or a car.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.500
It's surreal. Unbelievable.

21:04.583 --> 21:05.541
Catarina, sit down.

21:08.208 --> 21:09.166
-Candy?
-No.

21:09.750 --> 21:12.166
I'll try to make myself very clear.

21:12.958 --> 21:17.208
Your mom's accounting company
could be a laundromat.

21:18.458 --> 21:19.791
What do you mean?

21:19.875 --> 21:20.791
A laundromat.

21:22.041 --> 21:23.583
Okay, I got it.

21:24.666 --> 21:29.125
-But I have nothing to do with it.
-But everything your mom gave you does.

21:29.208 --> 21:32.875
I'm sifting through her bills
to see if there's anything left.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.541
But everything she gave you,
house, car, clothes,

21:36.625 --> 21:39.250
the money for your MBA in Switzerland--

21:39.333 --> 21:42.416
Those things were never yours, sweetheart.

21:44.625 --> 21:48.041
You're on your own now.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.791
Have you thought about getting a job?

21:54.541 --> 21:55.375
Ginger.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.291
-I'm sorry.
-Son?

22:09.375 --> 22:10.750
Look at that.

22:11.958 --> 22:14.458
-What are you doing here?
-Surprise!

22:14.541 --> 22:16.666
We'll spend the week here.
Your dad's idea.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.583
Didn't you say you'd be the manager?

22:19.125 --> 22:23.708
Yes. I'm just helping the guys
at the reception. That's all.

22:24.791 --> 22:29.208
That's how they like to work
on this trainee program.

22:29.291 --> 22:32.208
It works pretty well.
But I'm focusing on the top.

22:32.291 --> 22:34.958
-Top?
-Well, if you say so.

22:35.750 --> 22:39.166
I'm glad you gave up
making a living off of music.

22:39.250 --> 22:40.083
Amen.

22:40.833 --> 22:41.666
Amen.

23:03.416 --> 23:07.000
I just need to find the city and the year.
But it's hard.

23:13.291 --> 23:15.583
-Yasmin.
-Damn, Conrado! What the hell?

23:16.083 --> 23:17.333
-Is everything okay?
-Sorry.

23:19.625 --> 23:23.291
Can you take care
of the luggage for me today?

23:25.708 --> 23:28.208
-Okay.
-My parents are here.

23:28.291 --> 23:30.791
-I need to show them around.
-Your parents?

23:54.458 --> 23:57.041
Hey! I finally found you!

23:57.583 --> 23:59.333
I've been looking for hours!

24:00.000 --> 24:01.833
What a beautiful day, huh?

24:02.375 --> 24:04.625
I should get a nice tan in this sun.

24:06.416 --> 24:08.708
-Where's the girl?
-Did you order a drink?

24:10.083 --> 24:13.375
-Hours ago.
-Holly shit. That guy's fiancée.

24:15.041 --> 24:16.708
Oh God. What am I gonna do?

24:17.875 --> 24:21.041
Diego! Dieguito, come here.

24:22.166 --> 24:24.833
Could you serve those girls
for me, please?

24:24.916 --> 24:25.916
I can't right now.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.375
Pretty please?
I really can't serve that girl.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.666
I hooked up with a guy at the party.

24:31.750 --> 24:34.250
-Don't tell me you hooked up--
-Yes.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.708
-Her fiancé?
-Yes!

24:35.791 --> 24:39.125
-On the day he--
-Yes, but I swear I didn't know!

24:40.125 --> 24:40.958
That's bad.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.916
RODRIGO
27 MISSED CALLS

24:53.791 --> 24:54.625
Good morning!

24:57.541 --> 24:58.916
Gin and tonic for you.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.416
I ordered with lemon.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.833
-Didn't you ask for this one?
-Tell him in Spanish.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.750
Sure. I'll be right back
with the right one.

25:13.416 --> 25:15.291
What's going on with your mother?

25:15.916 --> 25:18.791
Everything's fine.
I talked to the lawyer today.

25:18.875 --> 25:21.333
It was a misunderstanding. Obviously.

25:21.416 --> 25:24.375
It'll be resolved. She'll be back soon.

25:24.458 --> 25:28.583
And I'm fine because I know
I can count on you, my sisters.

25:28.666 --> 25:30.291
So everything's fine.

25:31.083 --> 25:33.208
Vivi, it's time for our massage.

25:33.291 --> 25:35.583
-Remember? We'll be back, okay?
-Yes.

25:35.666 --> 25:36.791
Okay.

25:43.041 --> 25:43.958
Massage.

26:07.625 --> 26:08.583
Conrado!

26:08.666 --> 26:11.166
-Here already?
-I'm here to rehearse.

26:19.666 --> 26:20.500
Let's do it.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.083
Shit!

26:27.750 --> 26:30.833
-You're not well, are you?
-My parents are here.

26:31.583 --> 26:33.625
Your parents? Why?

26:34.541 --> 26:35.875
That's what they do.

26:35.958 --> 26:38.791
They're here to see me
on my trainee program.

26:38.875 --> 26:40.583
Trainee, Conrado?

26:40.666 --> 26:42.250
Why did I make this up?

26:42.333 --> 26:44.541
Anyway, let's do it.

26:44.625 --> 26:47.041
What are these? Your songs, right?

26:47.541 --> 26:48.375
Yes.

26:49.625 --> 26:53.125
One is a song I really like,
and the other is from church.

26:54.125 --> 26:57.625
If I play the one from church,
maybe they won't be so upset.

27:00.916 --> 27:03.875
Well, I'll try to be as clear as possible.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.333
This song is intense.

27:08.875 --> 27:10.416
But this one, Conrado--

27:10.500 --> 27:12.500
-This one is boring.
-No, Miguel!

27:12.583 --> 27:15.166
Now you don't have a choice, it's over.

27:15.666 --> 27:16.500
There you go.

27:17.541 --> 27:20.333
-You don't get it, dude.
-You'll play this one.

27:21.583 --> 27:23.708
My parents will find out why I came here.

27:26.041 --> 27:28.875
Follow me.
I'll take you to a special place.

27:29.750 --> 27:31.000
Ju? Vivi?

28:07.083 --> 28:08.166
JURERÊ SISTERS

28:08.250 --> 28:10.916
JU LEFT THE GROUP
VIVI LEFT THE GROUP

28:16.000 --> 28:18.708
Hi, beautiful!
Why don't you pick up the phone?

28:19.333 --> 28:20.166
Hi, Rodrigo.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.166
I'm waiting for you to go home.

28:22.250 --> 28:24.500
It's not a good time to talk.

28:24.583 --> 28:25.875
I have a lot on my mind.

28:25.958 --> 28:29.166
-Okay, but where are you going then?
-I don't know.

28:30.083 --> 28:32.208
I need to think. I'm here to think.

28:36.416 --> 28:37.250
Look…

28:39.250 --> 28:42.750
I know it's hard, but I think
we can look on the bright side.

28:43.833 --> 28:46.416
You know? Forget about the "NBA",

28:46.500 --> 28:48.791
and focus on what matters, on us.

28:48.875 --> 28:49.708
It's MBA.

28:50.375 --> 28:51.791
-With "M."
-Okay, MBA.

28:51.875 --> 28:54.875
It's not about forgetting,
you're talking about my future.

28:54.958 --> 28:56.625
-It's in two days--
-Relax.

28:56.708 --> 28:58.958
I know you're stressed
because of your mom--

28:59.041 --> 29:01.583
Yes, that was a mistake. A huge mistake.

29:01.666 --> 29:04.291
-And this is another huge mistake.
-Me? Why?

29:04.375 --> 29:06.583
-Don't lie.
-What? I'm listening.

29:06.666 --> 29:08.916
I saw you kissing that girl yesterday.

29:09.875 --> 29:10.750
At my party.

29:11.250 --> 29:14.083
In the middle of it. I saw it.

29:14.166 --> 29:16.083
Because of a slipup, we're a mistake?

29:16.166 --> 29:18.541
-A slipup?
-After all this time?

29:18.625 --> 29:20.750
-Was that a slipup?
-So no more wedding.

29:20.833 --> 29:22.500
-That's not it.
-It's over.

29:22.583 --> 29:23.625
-Listen--
-Let me go.

29:23.708 --> 29:26.500
I didn't wanna get married.
Your mom made me.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.291
She wanted someone
to take care of her girl.

29:30.375 --> 29:32.083
Maybe she knew she'd be arrested.

29:49.833 --> 29:51.375
This is paradise, Conrado!

29:56.208 --> 29:59.000
You know what I do
when the world wants to fuck me up?

29:59.833 --> 30:02.083
-I tell it to go to hell.
-The world?

30:02.958 --> 30:03.875
Yes, of course.

30:04.625 --> 30:07.875
I come up here and look at this view.

30:09.750 --> 30:10.708
I see the world.

30:12.708 --> 30:13.791
Then I shout.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.333
Wanna try?

30:16.750 --> 30:18.833
No. No need.

30:19.375 --> 30:21.500
All right. I'll go first.

30:25.166 --> 30:27.208
Fuck you!

30:28.583 --> 30:30.041
THE ISLAND BELONGS TO ALL

30:30.125 --> 30:32.291
-Come on. It's your turn.
-What?

30:32.375 --> 30:34.458
Release your soul. Just shout!

30:35.541 --> 30:37.916
-Fuck you?
-No, Conrado!

30:38.000 --> 30:40.041
It's not a question. Shout it out!

30:40.125 --> 30:41.791
Fuck you!

30:43.791 --> 30:46.375
-Fuck you.
-Your parents can't hear you.

30:46.458 --> 30:49.375
-Go ahead, shout! Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

30:49.458 --> 30:52.625
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

30:52.708 --> 30:53.916
Fuck!

30:54.583 --> 30:56.625
Fuck you!

31:00.166 --> 31:02.166
Bro, I don't know anything

31:02.708 --> 31:04.500
about your struggle,

31:05.291 --> 31:07.541
but to succeed,
we gotta win a battle a day.

31:08.250 --> 31:11.083
Today, that's singing
in front of your parents.

31:13.625 --> 31:14.458
So?

31:15.166 --> 31:16.333
Ready for the show?

31:18.750 --> 31:19.583
No.

31:57.875 --> 32:01.208
EVICTION ORDER

33:13.833 --> 33:16.625
-What the hell? What are you doing?
-Saving you.

33:16.708 --> 33:19.041
-Saving me from what?
-Are you okay?

33:36.500 --> 33:37.333
I'm sorry.

33:38.958 --> 33:43.291
It was instinct.
I saw you at the bottom and didn't think.

33:43.375 --> 33:45.166
It's okay, no need to apologize.

33:45.666 --> 33:47.041
Okay. Thank you.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.708
It's like a hurricane
turned my life upside down.

33:52.791 --> 33:55.083
I need to find a way to start over.

33:56.333 --> 33:57.791
At least down there

33:58.583 --> 33:59.708
it was silent.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.916
Whenever I feel lost,

34:07.750 --> 34:09.666
I remember a question.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.333
"Am I leading my life,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.541
or is it my life that's leading me?"

34:29.541 --> 34:30.375
Wow.

34:31.833 --> 34:32.750
I like it.

34:33.333 --> 34:34.875
What is that? Neruda?

34:34.958 --> 34:35.791
Almost.

34:36.583 --> 34:37.458
Mafalda.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.416
<i>Life is good</i>

35:07.000 --> 35:11.666
<i>I don't even know why I'm crying</i>
<i>I'm in my early 20s</i>

35:11.750 --> 35:13.625
<i>I won't stop now</i>

35:13.708 --> 35:15.666
<i>I miss my home</i>

35:15.750 --> 35:19.125
<i>My mom misses me</i>
<i>But that's okay</i>

35:19.208 --> 35:21.500
<i>That's the life I chose</i>

35:22.083 --> 35:25.166
<i>Since I was little</i>
<i>People tell me I'm curious</i>

35:25.250 --> 35:30.041
<i>People who see me now</i>
<i>Tell me I never grew up</i>

35:30.125 --> 35:34.250
<i>I'm not afraid of making mistakes</i>
<i>I'm just afraid of giving up</i>

35:34.333 --> 35:38.875
<i>But I'm in my early 20s</i>
<i>I won't stop now</i>

35:38.958 --> 35:40.666
<i>Who taught you how to dream?</i>

35:40.750 --> 35:43.375
<i>Who taught you how to dream?</i>

35:46.958 --> 35:49.958
<i>If boys don't cry</i>

35:51.083 --> 35:54.208
<i>Someone tell me what I am</i>

36:07.916 --> 36:12.041
<i>I have more than 20 plans</i>
<i>To fulfill before my 30s</i>

36:12.125 --> 36:14.375
<i>Someone tell me where we're going</i>

36:14.458 --> 36:16.541
<i>I'm excited to exist</i>

36:16.625 --> 36:20.750
<i>They told me "relax, bro"</i>
<i>You have plenty of time ahead</i>

36:20.833 --> 36:25.416
<i>To make mistakes</i>
<i>And I know I won't stop now</i>

36:25.500 --> 36:30.666
<i>Who taught you how to dream?</i>

36:36.333 --> 36:38.916
<i>Nobody taught me</i>

36:40.291 --> 36:42.666
<i>Where I'm going</i>

36:44.583 --> 36:48.916
<i>Nobody else goes</i>

36:49.500 --> 36:51.458
<i>Who taught you how to dream?</i>

36:51.541 --> 36:55.541
<i>Who taught you how to dream?</i>

37:20.541 --> 37:21.458
Hold on.

37:22.291 --> 37:23.500
Conrado?

37:24.708 --> 37:26.666
Dad, Mom, wait! Please.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.958
-We trusted you, son.
-I know.

37:30.041 --> 37:32.125
-But you can keep trusting me.
-How?

37:32.208 --> 37:35.541
You said this was the best program,
and you came here to sing?

37:36.708 --> 37:38.458
No. I already told you.

37:39.541 --> 37:40.750
I told you--

37:40.833 --> 37:44.125
We'd already talked about
what's best for your future.

37:44.208 --> 37:45.041
Yes, Dad, but--

37:45.125 --> 37:47.583
Do you know how much we've sacrificed?

37:47.666 --> 37:49.083
I know, Dad, but--

37:49.166 --> 37:51.583
<i>Calm down. You'll have to stay here.</i>

37:51.666 --> 37:54.375
<i>I didn't wanna get married.</i>
<i>Your mom wanted it.</i>

37:54.458 --> 37:56.708
<i>You're on your own now.</i>

37:57.541 --> 38:00.750
Do you know how hard we worked
to pay for your studies?

38:00.833 --> 38:03.583
-You don't wanna honor your parents!
-I do!

38:05.166 --> 38:06.916
It wasn't Conrado's fault.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.791
I'm sorry to interrupt
your family discussion.

38:09.875 --> 38:12.833
I'm Catarina, the staff supervisor.

38:12.916 --> 38:13.916
How are you?

38:15.291 --> 38:17.666
We've made a mistake.

38:18.416 --> 38:21.541
We've had a scheduling problem
with our singers,

38:21.625 --> 38:24.958
and the person in charge, Yasmin,

38:25.541 --> 38:28.708
she's new and got confused. Right?

38:28.791 --> 38:30.583
-I'm sorry.
-But it happens.

38:31.750 --> 38:35.750
Anyway, I asked
our most talented staff member

38:35.833 --> 38:38.916
to save the day, and that's what he did.

38:39.791 --> 38:43.333
I can assure you Conrado will be
my right-hand man here.

38:43.416 --> 38:46.041
By the way,
thank you for your help, Conrado.

38:46.958 --> 38:47.791
No problem.

38:49.291 --> 38:50.166
Is that true?

38:51.625 --> 38:52.458
Of course.

38:54.708 --> 38:57.208
I think it's time
for us to go home, Natan.

39:00.416 --> 39:02.500
-Would you like some water? Coffee?
-Thanks.

39:06.708 --> 39:07.750
Thank you.

39:08.333 --> 39:10.708
-Catarina!
-Good one.

39:11.416 --> 39:14.833
Now, where did you find that uniform?

39:14.916 --> 39:17.083
I got it at the office,

39:18.500 --> 39:20.916
and I guess I'm part of this family now.

39:29.375 --> 39:33.375
A special day demands a special dessert.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.958
Look what I brought for you.

39:35.041 --> 39:37.041
-Stop eating.
-He didn't finish yet.

39:37.125 --> 39:40.041
There's enough to all of you.

39:40.125 --> 39:43.875
Wait. Are those from my party?

39:43.958 --> 39:47.291
It's not polite to ask
where a gift comes from.

39:47.375 --> 39:49.083
Just take it. Go ahead.

39:50.041 --> 39:51.875
-I made those. Take one.
-Want some?

39:52.791 --> 39:53.875
-Son.
-Good, right?

39:54.833 --> 39:55.666
Dad?

39:55.750 --> 39:58.750
-I was going to say goodbye.
-You're coming with us.

40:00.916 --> 40:02.833
You still have time, you don't need this.

40:04.083 --> 40:05.583
I'll help you pack.

40:13.333 --> 40:16.291
Conrado, tell him you'll stay.

40:17.916 --> 40:18.875
Like I said,

40:19.375 --> 40:20.500
it's not that easy.

40:39.791 --> 40:42.458
We can't let him leave like that.
We must do something!

40:42.541 --> 40:44.208
-I agree.
-Please!

40:44.291 --> 40:46.666
-Then let's go get him!
-Let's go!

40:47.416 --> 40:50.750
-Conrado!
-Conrado!

40:50.833 --> 40:52.458
Don't leave!

40:52.541 --> 40:55.416
-We're coming, Conrado!
-Conrado!

40:55.500 --> 40:58.375
-Stay with us, Conrado!
-Come on!

40:59.250 --> 41:00.750
A battle a day, remember?

41:01.416 --> 41:02.666
Come on, Conrado!

41:04.791 --> 41:06.875
-Son--
-I'm sorry, Dad.

41:09.708 --> 41:10.541
Yes!

41:12.833 --> 41:13.708
Natan.

41:14.291 --> 41:15.125
Let him go.

41:16.250 --> 41:17.375
Come here.

41:22.625 --> 41:24.416
That's what I'm talking about!

41:26.416 --> 41:27.458
Thanks, man.

41:29.291 --> 41:32.750
Cheers to the newcomers, to this staff,

41:32.833 --> 41:35.541
and to summer, which has just begun.

41:35.625 --> 41:37.916
-Take one, please.
-To the staff, baby!

41:39.083 --> 41:39.916
Hi.

41:42.083 --> 41:45.875
I talked to Vilma. We're roommates now.

41:47.625 --> 41:50.125
-Dieguito, your turn.
-Repeat after me, okay?

41:50.208 --> 41:51.083
Okay.

41:51.166 --> 41:52.833
<i>-Arriba.</i>
<i>-Arriba.</i>

41:52.916 --> 41:54.500

42:23.833 --> 42:25.500
-Marília! Hi.
-What the heck?

42:26.125 --> 42:28.583
Ask your daughter if I can date her mom.

42:38.791 --> 42:41.125
<i>-Adentro.</i>
<i>-Adentro.</i>

42:42.333 --> 42:44.125
Catarina, I want to apologize.

42:44.666 --> 42:46.833
I swear I didn't know, for real.

42:48.583 --> 42:51.125
Relax, Helena. He's a jerk.

42:51.208 --> 42:52.125
-Really?
-Yes.

42:52.208 --> 42:53.125
-You sure?
-Yep.

43:06.958 --> 43:09.416
-I'm going to ask her.
-All right.

43:11.916 --> 43:12.916
<i>Hasta mañana.</i>

43:19.541 --> 43:21.916
-Staff, to the sea!
-What?

43:22.708 --> 43:23.541
To the sea!

43:23.625 --> 43:26.541
STAFF ONLY

43:27.875 --> 43:30.833
The last one will have to clean the room!

43:54.708 --> 43:57.333
Hey, city girl. Aren't you joining them?

43:59.250 --> 44:01.750
Do you really think
we're gonna be friends?

44:02.250 --> 44:03.083
Ouch.

44:04.333 --> 44:07.041
Actually, I've no idea
what's going on between us.

44:07.125 --> 44:09.000
You said I broke into the cabin.

44:09.083 --> 44:09.916
Me?

44:10.000 --> 44:13.166
Yes. And treated me as a subordinate
in front of Conrado's parents.

44:13.250 --> 44:15.791
No. Yasmin, you're confused.

44:15.875 --> 44:18.250
I said those things to help Conrado.

44:18.333 --> 44:20.875
I meant no harm. I didn't realize that.

44:22.625 --> 44:25.791
Not realizing things
is a privilege I've never had.

44:26.333 --> 44:28.541
I know what kind of girl you are.

44:29.708 --> 44:31.375
What kind of girl am I?

44:32.458 --> 44:34.000
You're the opposite of me.

44:40.333 --> 44:41.458
Fuck Catarina.

44:41.541 --> 44:44.166
-You're single now.
-I'm still mourning.

44:44.250 --> 44:45.958
Give me a break.

44:46.041 --> 44:48.166
Mourning? For a criminal's daughter?

44:49.125 --> 44:52.375
She'll never find someone
better than me. She knows it.

44:52.458 --> 44:53.500
She really won't.

44:59.416 --> 45:00.416
I'm sorry.

45:05.875 --> 45:07.291
-Let's go.
-No way, man.

45:07.375 --> 45:09.375
-What the heck?
-No. Let's go!

45:10.458 --> 45:12.625
What are you doing? Are you insane?

45:13.541 --> 45:15.166
It was instinct. I'm sorry.

45:17.041 --> 45:18.083
Spoiled brat.

45:34.125 --> 45:35.916
STAFF ONLY

45:54.958 --> 45:55.791
Hey.

46:02.375 --> 46:04.875
Were you in Caraíva, in Bahia, in 2002?

46:08.041 --> 46:09.875
In 2002? Yes.

46:09.958 --> 46:11.250
Why?

46:13.041 --> 46:14.583
Because I'm your daughter.
