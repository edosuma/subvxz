00:01.566 --> 00:03.307
NISCHELLE: These celebrities
have been on a secret

00:03.351 --> 00:05.831
two-week mission
back to their hometown...

00:05.875 --> 00:08.051
This was my room.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.053
Uncle Roy used to
always take care of me,

00:10.097 --> 00:11.489
always babysit me.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.925
NISCHELLE: ...to surprise
that special someone

00:12.969 --> 00:15.102
who helped lead them
to greatness.

00:15.145 --> 00:16.842
You changed the course
of my life.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.366
She encouraged us.

00:18.409 --> 00:19.889
She was like, "You guys need
to go chase your dreams."

00:19.932 --> 00:21.456
NISCHELLE: With an amazing
design team...

00:22.674 --> 00:25.112
...and a lot of hard work...

00:25.155 --> 00:27.592
Whoa!

00:28.724 --> 00:30.682
[shouting]

00:30.726 --> 00:32.597
NISCHELLE: ...these celebrities
are saying thank you

00:32.641 --> 00:34.860
with a surprise home renovation.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.949
This is so beautiful.

00:36.993 --> 00:39.126
The best part of me
is because of you.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.519
[sobbing]

00:41.563 --> 00:43.347
NISCHELLE:
Tonight...

00:43.391 --> 00:44.740
NARRATOR:
Aaron Donald's on his back.

00:44.783 --> 00:47.090
NISCHELLE:
...Los Angeles Rams number 99

00:47.134 --> 00:49.049
and Super Bowl champion
Aaron Donald

00:49.092 --> 00:51.877
is headed home
to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania...

00:51.921 --> 00:53.270
AARON:
I've been somebody that

00:53.314 --> 00:55.490
really was molded
and born in this city.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.231
When you walk in here, does it
take you right back to...

00:57.274 --> 00:58.058
AARON:
A hundred percent.

00:58.101 --> 00:59.276
'Cause we was grinding it.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.364
NISCHELLE:
...where Aaron's father

01:00.408 --> 01:02.018
took a young teenager

01:02.062 --> 01:03.672
needing motivation...

01:03.715 --> 01:05.239
AARON: When you talk
about my work ethic,

01:05.282 --> 01:07.719
my discipline, you know,
I get all that from my dad.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.895
NISCHELLE:
...and showed him
how hard work and dedication

01:09.939 --> 01:11.636
could transform his son

01:11.680 --> 01:14.422
into the NFL's number one
defensive player.

01:14.465 --> 01:17.120
Aaron has come home
to say thank you to Dad

01:17.164 --> 01:20.210
by surprising him with
a much-needed home renovation.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.864
-He knows nothing.
-Nothing.
-It's a big surprise.

01:21.907 --> 01:23.518
AARON:
I wanted to just keep it

01:23.561 --> 01:25.607
as secret as we can,
so he had no clue.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.087
NISCHELLE:
For the first time ever,

01:27.130 --> 01:31.178
our celebrity's recipient
has absolutely no idea

01:31.221 --> 01:33.267
what's about to happen.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.485
-[grunting]
-Whoa!

01:34.529 --> 01:35.704
NISCHELLE:
During the two weeks,

01:35.747 --> 01:36.966
Aaron must tackle
the hard work...

01:37.009 --> 01:38.359
Think your dad's
gonna like this?

01:38.402 --> 01:39.316
Yeah, he's gonna love it, man.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.143
NISCHELLE:
...and also

01:40.187 --> 01:41.710
keep Dad in the dark.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.015
And this is not a documentary.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.976
[chuckles]

01:47.019 --> 01:48.543
NISCHELLE:
The hammer will fall,

01:48.586 --> 01:50.588
the tears will flow.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.895
But can the secret be kept?

01:52.938 --> 01:56.812
We'll find out next on
Secret Celebrity Renovation.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.858
â™ª

02:06.996 --> 02:10.347
-99's back in the Burgh.
-[chuckles]

02:10.390 --> 02:12.219
-You're here.
-Yes.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.221
NISCHELLE: You know, I've been
here for a couple days,

02:14.264 --> 02:16.440
wanting to figure out, you know,
what Aaron Donald's Pittsburgh

02:16.484 --> 02:18.181
is all about.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.704
And I have to say, my man,
you mention your name,

02:20.749 --> 02:22.794
and it's like...
folks lose their mind.

02:22.838 --> 02:25.362
-[laughing]
-The prodigal son is back.

02:25.406 --> 02:26.885
-It's a lot of love.
-Yeah.

02:26.929 --> 02:27.886
You know, it's definitely
a lot of love,

02:27.930 --> 02:29.366
a lot of support in Pittsburgh.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.499
Even though, you know,
making my career in the NFL,

02:31.542 --> 02:34.589
I was in, you know, Los Angeles,
being somebody that really

02:34.632 --> 02:36.591
was molded and born
in this city, man,

02:36.634 --> 02:39.680
and to be able to come back
and still have that support

02:39.724 --> 02:41.291
-is special, so...
-Yeah.

02:41.335 --> 02:45.208
So when I said, "Aaron, listen,
you've come a long way,

02:45.252 --> 02:47.863
"you've done so much
in your career and in your life,

02:47.906 --> 02:49.256
"and I know there's
got to be somebody

02:49.299 --> 02:51.214
"that you want to say
thank you to,

02:51.258 --> 02:52.868
somebody who's done something
really good for you."

02:52.911 --> 02:54.609
-And immediately,
you were like, "My dad!"
-Yes.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.309
Definitely, when you talk
about my work ethic,

02:59.353 --> 03:01.398
my discipline, you know,
I get all that from my dad.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.966
My dad instilled that to me
at a young age.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.359
And, to--
In our eyes, growing up,

03:05.402 --> 03:06.969
-he was the ultimate
alpha male, so...
-Yeah.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.449
We never had to look
outside the household.

03:08.492 --> 03:11.234
We just always had a man
in the household to look up to

03:11.278 --> 03:13.323
that you felt like, you know,
he was everything.

03:14.629 --> 03:17.545
I live by "hard work pay off."
My dad told me that as a kid.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.416
Every time we worked out,
"hard work pay off."

03:19.460 --> 03:21.462
So "hard work pays off."

03:21.505 --> 03:22.941
-You would hear that
all the time.
-All the time.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.682
When we were lifting,
you know, I'd be like,

03:24.726 --> 03:27.076
"Come on, push yourself.
Man made it. Man can lift it."

03:27.119 --> 03:28.947
-Ooh.
-Certain things like that.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.471
I love that. Man made it,
so man can lift it.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.081
-Yeah.
-Mm.

03:32.124 --> 03:34.083
That might supplant
the "hard work pays off."

03:34.126 --> 03:35.127
-[laughing]
-That's pretty catchy.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.696
-So we're going to
your childhood home now.
-Mm-hmm.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.655
-And this is where we're going
to do the renovation.
-Yes.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.179
But your parents
don't live there.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.137
-This is our childhood home
where we were raised.
-The family house.

03:45.180 --> 03:46.791
-Yes, the family house,
where you go...
-I like it. Okay.

03:46.835 --> 03:49.272
...and the fellas can hang. And
that's exactly how we use it.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.752
You know, my nephew
go down there and train.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.014
My dad still work down there,

03:52.057 --> 03:53.581
-my brother still
work down there.
-Oh.

03:53.624 --> 03:56.453
When we was kids, my dad
started buying gym equipment

03:56.497 --> 03:57.585
to put in the basement.

03:57.628 --> 03:59.369
And over the years,
as growing up,

03:59.413 --> 04:01.893
we used to always, you know,
sit on the top of the steps

04:01.937 --> 04:04.113
and watch my dad work out,
'cause at the time,

04:04.156 --> 04:05.157
we was too young
to work out with him, so...

04:05.201 --> 04:07.203
-Yeah.
-Once we was old enough

04:07.247 --> 04:08.117
to really work out with him,
it was like,

04:08.160 --> 04:10.119
it was like an accomplishment,

04:10.162 --> 04:11.555
like we finally made it,
to be able to be in the dungeon.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.383
-[laughing]
-You know,
it's just the basement.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.690
-Yeah, it's like
the rite of passage.
-It's, like, gloomy.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.170
It got that dungeon feel
when you're down there.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.216
So, um, that's why we call it

04:20.260 --> 04:22.349
-the dungeon.
-NISCHELLE: It's
the super-duper man cave.

04:22.392 --> 04:24.220
-AARON: Yeah, exactly. That's...
-NISCHELLE: Okay.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.136
-Yes. [laughing]
-Well, this lady is gonna
infiltrate the man cave.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.832
And we're-- Oh.
This is gonna be special.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.705
-Yes.
-I can't wait to do this.

04:30.748 --> 04:35.362
Now, are we really gonna be able
to not tell him anything?

04:35.405 --> 04:38.016
Right now, he thinks that
this is a documentary on me.

04:38.060 --> 04:41.019
-[laughing]
-Obviously, you know,
I told him the time span,

04:41.063 --> 04:42.325
and he told my wife,
he was like,

04:42.369 --> 04:44.109
"All right, make sure
you get me involved."

04:44.153 --> 04:45.720
And I said, "Yeah.

04:45.763 --> 04:46.938
"They want you to come down
and do some interviews too, Dad.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.723
Don't worry."
You know? So...

04:48.766 --> 04:50.812
-In two weeks.
-[both laughing]

04:50.855 --> 04:52.596
NISCHELLE:
It's a good thing
you're a superstar

04:52.640 --> 04:54.294
-and he believes it all.
-[laughing]

04:54.337 --> 04:55.817
AARON:
I just want to see his face.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.558
You know?
Hopefully he won't cry,

04:57.601 --> 04:59.560
you know,
because he's a tough guy,

04:59.603 --> 05:00.909
but he got a little bit
emotional with it...

05:00.952 --> 05:02.345
No, I hope he does.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.304
[laughing]

05:05.392 --> 05:07.481
-Is that your dad?
-That's him.

05:07.524 --> 05:08.525
Nice.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.790
NISCHELLE:
Okay, so I am the one taking you
through this documentary, right?

05:12.834 --> 05:13.835
Doing all the interviews.

05:13.878 --> 05:15.837
So that's my role.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.360
-I'm excited to meet him.
-Let's go.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.579
And be an actress.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.494
[both laughing]

05:20.537 --> 05:21.712
Hi.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.061
-Hi, how you doing?
-I'm Nischelle.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.236
Nice to meet you, Nischelle.
Archie Donald.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.237
Nice to meet you. Yeah.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.326
-How've you been?
-I'm good.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.936
How you doing, big man?

05:27.979 --> 05:29.111
I told him
it looks like you just came

05:29.154 --> 05:30.068
from working out yourself.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.983
-Yes, I did. Yes.
-Nice.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.029
Well, I appreciate
you letting us

05:34.072 --> 05:36.683
kind of take over this house
for a little bit,

05:36.727 --> 05:39.600
because, listen, when we want
to tell Aaron's story,

05:39.643 --> 05:40.992
what better place to do it
than in his childhood home?

05:41.036 --> 05:42.603
-ARCHIE: Absolutely.
-NISCHELLE: You know?

05:42.646 --> 05:44.169
All right, well, you can finish
doing what you're doing.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.433
-We're going to go in.
We're going to get started.
-Okay.

05:46.476 --> 05:47.782
-It was so good to meet you.
-Appreciate your time.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.088
-We appreciate it.
-Come on, big man.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.221
NISCHELLE:
So Archie is scheduled
to come back in two weeks...

05:52.264 --> 05:54.005
-Bye, Archie.
-Bye-bye.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.399
...to shoot his big scene
for our fake documentary.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.401
But until then,
Archie has agreed

05:58.445 --> 06:00.621
to stay out of the house
to not interfere

06:00.664 --> 06:01.926
with the camera crews.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.363
That will give our design team

06:03.406 --> 06:06.061
just enough time
to do their renovation magic.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.237
So what do you think?

06:08.280 --> 06:09.325
Are you excited
about Aaron Donald?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.805
He plays for L.A.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.328
and that's my hometown.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.026
He is thedefensive player
of the NFL.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.159
He's the number one guy.

06:17.202 --> 06:20.075
-SABRINA: You know what
I can't wait to see?
-ROB: What's that?

06:20.118 --> 06:21.946
-[raspy voice]: The dungeon.
-Yeah. [laughing]

06:21.990 --> 06:23.774
-There they are.
-[horn honking]

06:23.818 --> 06:25.123
NISCHELLE:
Hi!

06:25.167 --> 06:27.952
It's gonna be so fun.
Hi, guys.

06:27.996 --> 06:28.997
â™ª We made it.â™ª

06:29.040 --> 06:30.128
I know.
I was wondering, like,

06:30.172 --> 06:31.565
where the heck are they?

06:31.608 --> 06:32.740
-ROB: Hey, how you doin'?
-Sabrina, this is Aaron.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.219
-Rob, this is Aaron.
-Hey, man. Big fan.

06:34.263 --> 06:35.960
-Hello, I appreciate you.
-I know that, oh--

06:36.004 --> 06:37.222
You know this is
a Patriots guy.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.832
-[laughing]
-So just watch him.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.356
-Watch him.
-This is the guy

06:40.400 --> 06:43.272
-that every Patriot
is afraid of.
-Absolutely.

06:43.315 --> 06:45.883
Then everybody in the NFL
is afraid of.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.755
-But this is a safe space now.
-Very safe.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.539
-Just a minute.
His dad was here.
-Okay.

06:49.582 --> 06:51.411
When we got here.
He knows nothing.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.629
-Nothing?
-Nothing at all.
-So big surprise.

06:52.673 --> 06:56.198
This is our first big,
big, big surprise.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.591
-Yeah.
-So we got to do this one right.

06:57.634 --> 06:58.679
This is his childhood home.

06:58.722 --> 06:59.854
-Childhood home.
-Okay.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.377
But this is also
where this was built,

07:01.421 --> 07:03.118
-in the dungeon, right?
-Okay.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.207
-Right.
-Okay. So, can we go inside
and check it?

07:05.250 --> 07:06.382
-Here we go.
-All right, let's go.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.949
-The dungeon.
-The dungeon.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.385
[imitates fanfare]

07:09.429 --> 07:12.083
NISCHELLE [laughing]:
All right.

07:12.127 --> 07:14.216
-AARON: Childhood home.
-NISCHELLE: All right.

07:14.259 --> 07:17.088
-SABRINA: So this is
part of the renovation.
-NISCHELLE: He grew up here.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.307
-SABRINA: Okay.
-But when Aaron bought

07:18.350 --> 07:21.223
his father and mother
a new house,

07:21.266 --> 07:22.746
his dad didn't want
to get rid of this house.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.444
SABRINA:
We don't have
to design for living.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.227
-We're designing
for hanging out.
-NISCHELLE: Yeah.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.402
-Right.
-For lounging.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.925
-So good to... Yeah.
-Okay.
-Yeah.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.449
-Now it can be
a little bit more fun.
-She...

07:29.492 --> 07:31.712
-NISCHELLE and SABRINA: Yes.
-ROB: This might be

07:31.755 --> 07:33.453
my favorite one yet.

07:33.496 --> 07:36.499
Not only do I get to work
with one of the best in the NFL,

07:36.543 --> 07:40.895
but we're turning this house
into one giant clubhouse.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.331
-Okay, so this is hangout?
-Yes.

07:42.374 --> 07:44.202
What about that space
over there?

07:44.246 --> 07:45.900
AARON:
So...

07:45.943 --> 07:47.205
-this the dining area.
-SABRINA: This is dining.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.469
AARON:
We chill here, talk, play cards

07:49.512 --> 07:51.340
-or something here
with each other.
-You do play cards?

07:51.383 --> 07:52.776
-Yes. Yup.
-Okay, that's what
I was thinking.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.735
Like, if this is going
to be a man cave, maybe we just

07:54.778 --> 07:57.215
swap out the kitchen table
for a poker table.

07:57.259 --> 07:58.869
AARON:
Yes. That's a good vibe.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.305
-We vibe here.
-Whoa!

08:00.349 --> 08:01.655
We game, we talk, chill.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.178
-You have them agreeing already.
-Yeah.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.832
-This is good.
-That doesn't happen often.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.442
-First time, actually, I think.
-This...

08:06.486 --> 08:08.096
-Okay.
-This is so exciting.

08:08.139 --> 08:11.055
The $64 million question--
the red carpet.

08:11.099 --> 08:12.883
-AARON: It could go.
-NISCHELLE: Thank you.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.364
-ROB: Even I know that.
-I'm tired of seeing
the red carpet.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.844
-ROB: Yeah, for sure.
-SABRINA: So, hopefully,

08:16.887 --> 08:18.672
there's hardwood floors.
That'll save us some time.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.325
-ROB: Maybe there were earlier.
-If this doesn't have to be

08:20.369 --> 08:21.892
-a dining room, this could be,
like, a game space.
-Yes.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.241
-NISCHELLE: Yeah.
-That's going
to be fun to design.

08:23.285 --> 08:24.765
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Ooh, so good.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.331
Okay. Game space, lounge.
What's going on in here?

08:27.594 --> 08:29.030
AARON:
This is the kitchen.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.248
-This is the kitchen.
-Mm.

08:30.292 --> 08:31.815
AARON:
Really nothing in here works,

08:31.859 --> 08:34.034
-but you-- just to put the
waters in the fridge.
-Oh.

08:34.078 --> 08:36.124
So pretty much everything
can go in here.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.734
-Okay. This...
-Looks like we already did

08:37.778 --> 08:39.519
-some renovation
on the cabinets.
-SABRINA: Yeah.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.477
-Yeah, we-we tried.
-NISCHELLE: There's
a black and white motif.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.131
-Yeah.
-Well, you know it's a big trend
in kitchens right now.

08:43.174 --> 08:44.349
-It's called
the "tuxedo kitchen."
-NISCHELLE: Oh, okay.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.395
-It's just not this.
-[laughter]

08:46.438 --> 08:48.005
NISCHELLE:
This brand of tuxedo?

08:48.049 --> 08:51.008
SABRINA:
We have three full rooms
to transform

08:51.052 --> 08:53.968
into the ultimate clubhouse
for the Donald family.

08:54.011 --> 08:57.493
In the living room, we'll rip
out the old red carpeting,

08:57.537 --> 08:59.495
and hopefully find
usable hardwood floors

08:59.539 --> 09:01.758
that we could refinish
underneath.

09:01.802 --> 09:04.369
Then we'll give it a face-lift
with new paint and lighting,

09:04.413 --> 09:06.241
comfy furniture,
storage cabinets

09:06.284 --> 09:08.025
and a stylish fireplace design.

09:08.069 --> 09:11.376
The dining room will become
the new game room

09:11.420 --> 09:13.596
with a real poker table
that I plan to customize

09:13.640 --> 09:16.381
with Aaron's Rams jersey
number 99.

09:16.425 --> 09:20.298
And the new kitchen will be
clubhouse snack central,

09:20.342 --> 09:21.952
with a large fridge
and new microwave,

09:21.996 --> 09:24.085
lots of storage, new tile floor

09:24.128 --> 09:27.131
and beautiful
quartz countertops.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.264
-Now it's time
for the... â™ª Dun, dun, dun!â™ª
-I want to see it.

09:29.307 --> 09:31.788
-The dungeon.
-Dungeon.
-Bring us to the dungeon, Aaron.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.485
-Let's go.
-So this is where
it all started right here.

09:33.529 --> 09:36.314
-Oh, oh, oh, oh.
-ROB: Oh, boy.

09:36.358 --> 09:39.013
-A lot of history down here,
A lot.
-Whoa. Whoa.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.928
ROB:
I can see how this is going
to make you tough.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.756
-NISCHELLE: Oh,
this is the dungeon!
-AARON: I told you.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.801
NISCHELLE:
All right.

09:44.845 --> 09:47.412
-AARON: Full-blown dungeon.
-NISCHELLE: Nice!

09:47.456 --> 09:48.631
-How much do these weigh?
-Pictured it just like this.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.502
AARON:
These are 60s.

09:50.546 --> 09:51.852
-Let's see.
-Them is 50s.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.636
-Ooh.
-Ooh-whee!
-See if you can get those.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.464
-Oh, come on, man.
-Dude, you got to do it.

09:55.507 --> 09:56.639
-What you gonna do to me, Aaron?
-Rob.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.641
-Come on, Rob.
-Come on, Rob.
-Aaron.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.034
-Bring me two here. Yeah.
-One hand, one hand.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.514
That's wicked crazy.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.038
Aaron was insane
handing me that thing.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.214
I can't lift that.

10:06.257 --> 10:08.651
-I love that you did that.
-That's out...

10:08.695 --> 10:10.784
That's out of my contract.
I can't do that.

10:10.827 --> 10:14.004
He can bench-press
nearly 500 pounds.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.659
That's absolutely insane.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.661
I love it.
Okay, so this is the dungeon.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.315
We can make this tricked out.

10:20.358 --> 10:21.838
-Like, we can really
make this cool.
-ROB: Yeah.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.666
One thing I want--
we want to keep these.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.233
I... We can get rid of this,
but we got

10:25.276 --> 10:26.843
-to keep the old rusty weights.
-Okay.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.453
-Keep the plates,
keep the old-school.
-That's-that's...

10:28.497 --> 10:31.021
So, wait. No new weights? All...
Keep all the old weights?

10:31.065 --> 10:33.676
We can bring new weights in,
but we need, like, all those.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.678
-Just these? I got you. Okay.
-Even the old dumbbells.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.332
-Like, all the old...
-It's nostalgic. Okay.

10:37.375 --> 10:40.814
Them 45s is really 60s because
of all the rust on 'em, so...

10:40.857 --> 10:42.990
-[laughter]
-You know, we got to like that.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.905
Wait till you guys see
his dad, though.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.689
-Daddy is as ripped as Aaron.
-ROB: Dad's in shape, too?

10:46.733 --> 10:48.648
-SABRINA: Really?
-Yes. Yes.
-I get it from my daddy.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.301
-Well, you have to get it
from someone, right?
-I get it

10:50.345 --> 10:51.433
from my daddy.

10:51.476 --> 10:52.652
Before we start
the renovation, I want

10:52.695 --> 10:54.741
to do a little, uh,
workout in the dungeon.

10:54.784 --> 10:58.005
-[straining]
-[laughter]

10:58.048 --> 10:59.571
[groans]
Oh, my God. Do you do this?

10:59.615 --> 11:01.356
Are-are you really trying?

11:01.399 --> 11:03.837
-Sabrina.
-What?
-You're not really trying.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.839
-Yeah, I was.
-[laughter]

11:05.882 --> 11:07.579
-[grunting]
-ROB: Come on! Together!

11:07.623 --> 11:09.756
Teamwork!

11:12.062 --> 11:15.022
-[grunts softly]
-Whoa!
-[cheering]

11:15.065 --> 11:16.980
[laughter, clapping]

11:17.024 --> 11:20.288
Are you kidding me?
[groans]

11:20.331 --> 11:23.247
I have no words for that.
That is just insane.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.858
NISCHELLE:
All right.
Is it only lifting here?

11:24.901 --> 11:27.164
Is there any cardio done?
Is there any...?

11:27.208 --> 11:28.905
There's no cardio.
I would like, like,

11:28.949 --> 11:30.167
a bike or something
to do cardio.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.126
SABRINA:
In the basement, we'll make it

11:32.169 --> 11:34.040
into a state-of-the art
workout area,

11:34.084 --> 11:35.695
but still keep
that dungeon feel.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.305
We'll replace the old windows,

11:37.348 --> 11:39.220
hide the support poles
and utilities,

11:39.263 --> 11:41.613
and add more light
and padded floor tiles.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.703
The old, rusted
free weights will stay,

11:43.746 --> 11:45.269
but we'll complement them

11:45.313 --> 11:47.097
with plenty of new equipment
as well,

11:47.141 --> 11:50.797
including some cardio that
Aaron's dad is going to love.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.450
And we'll finish it off

11:52.494 --> 11:54.061
with an all-in-one
washer and dryer

11:54.104 --> 11:57.325
and wet bar with mini fridge.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.806
-We have a lot of work to do.
-ROB: Yeah.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.633
-NISCHELLE: Yeah.
-ROB: This is one
of the biggest ones

12:01.677 --> 12:03.810
-we've ever undertaken.
-NISCHELLE: Absolutely.
-1,000%.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.246
-That means let's get
to work now.
-Yeah.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.638
-Yes. Let's go.
-Okay, let's do it.

12:06.682 --> 12:07.944
-Go, go, go, go, go.
-All right.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.554
-Ladies first.
-Thank you, darling.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.078
-Oh, Rob goes first.
-Oh, Rob.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.688
[laughter]

12:12.732 --> 12:14.037
No, Rob, go ahead.

12:14.081 --> 12:15.822
Aaron,
don't make me look bad again.

12:15.865 --> 12:19.086
-That's twice now.
-[laughter]

12:19.129 --> 12:20.740
NISCHELLE:
I am really excited
about this renovation.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.306
All right.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.786
NISCHELLE:
And we've never been able

12:23.830 --> 12:25.875
to surprise anyone like this.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.355
-Aaron, you're in great hands,
okay?
-Oh, thank you.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.791
Ooh, I can't wait for this one!

12:28.835 --> 12:30.053
All right, guys. See you.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.707
So, we get some
of the stuff packed up,

12:31.751 --> 12:34.971
but with one of the strongest
men in the NFL here,

12:35.015 --> 12:38.105
I can't wait
to demo this kitchen.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.803
Aaron, how are you with, like,
power tools and construction?

12:40.847 --> 12:41.804
AARON:
Uh...

12:41.848 --> 12:43.327
Have you done this before?

12:43.371 --> 12:45.721
-Nope.
-Okay.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.289
Normally, we'd use some tools
for this, but I feel like

12:48.332 --> 12:49.681
-we got a big guy.
-Well...

12:49.725 --> 12:51.335
-Let's go.
-Really?

12:51.379 --> 12:52.772
-Yup. All together. On three.
-One, two.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.382
One, two, three. [grunts]

12:54.425 --> 12:57.080
Whoa!

12:57.124 --> 12:59.126
Normally, I would
cut it up into pieces,

12:59.169 --> 13:02.085
but Aaron just saved us a ton
of time.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.957
-Man, you're hired.
-[laughs]

13:04.000 --> 13:06.307
All right. We'll bring him
on every one.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.744
[groans]

13:08.788 --> 13:10.702
The best part of demo.

13:10.746 --> 13:13.053
Take all your aggression out.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.794
Aah!

13:15.925 --> 13:18.406
Two, three.

13:26.675 --> 13:29.591
-You want to work demo with me,
you got a job, buddy.
-Might.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.640
-SABRINA: Yes.
-ROB: That's right.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.904
Do you remember when we started
taking the kitchen apart,

13:37.947 --> 13:39.644
I asked you
if you were good with demo?

13:39.688 --> 13:41.733
And you were like, "No, I'm not.
I don't know how to use tools."

13:41.777 --> 13:43.953
-You look pretty good to me.
-You actually are. Yeah.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.826
You're not good. You're great!

13:46.869 --> 13:49.567
Just, as-as a kid doing it, oh,
my gosh, I'd be in some trouble.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.265
[Rob laughs]

13:52.353 --> 13:54.572
NISCHELLE:
Aaron takes me back

13:54.616 --> 13:56.226
to his high school days
here in Pittsburgh...

13:56.270 --> 13:59.229
Is there a signature move
that you do today

13:59.273 --> 14:00.752
-that he gave?
-This one move.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.667
...where I have a little
surprise waiting for him.

14:02.711 --> 14:03.886
-Coach Gibs. [laughs]
-Hi.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.019
Looking good, man.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.324
NISCHELLE:
And with a workload mounting

14:07.368 --> 14:09.631
and less than two weeks
to finish...

14:09.674 --> 14:10.806
Think your dad's going
to like this?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.112
I think he's going
to love it, man.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.374
...Aaron reaches out

14:13.417 --> 14:14.854
to his older brother
Archie for help.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.291
-This is the famous Archie?
-Yeah, that's big bro.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.822
NISCHELLE:
Super Bowl champion Aaron Donald

14:26.866 --> 14:29.694
has convinced his father
that he's filming a documentary

14:29.738 --> 14:31.783
at the family home
in Pittsburgh.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.874
And while Dad believes the house
is off-limits for two weeks...

14:34.917 --> 14:36.092
Two, three. [grunts]

14:36.136 --> 14:38.007
...Aaron and our all-pro
design team

14:38.051 --> 14:39.661
are hard at work to surprise him

14:39.704 --> 14:41.184
with an amazing renovation.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.143
AARON:
I wanted to just keep it

14:43.186 --> 14:45.493
as sec... as secret
as we can so he had no clue.

14:45.536 --> 14:46.407
He's just thinking it's,

14:46.450 --> 14:48.931
it's a documentary on my life.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.020
Aaron definitely made
quick work of the kitchen,

14:51.064 --> 14:53.066
and now I can turn
my attention to the living room.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.111
All right, moment of truth.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.504
It-It's time
for this carpet to go.

14:56.547 --> 14:59.115
The old red carpeting is
a styling nightmare,

14:59.159 --> 15:00.856
so I'm just hoping

15:00.900 --> 15:02.466
that there are hardwood floors
underneath them.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.946
-You ready?
-I got the orchestra seats

15:03.990 --> 15:05.600
because, to me,
as a designer, this is...

15:05.643 --> 15:07.167
There's nothing more exciting
than this happening.

15:07.210 --> 15:09.952
She loves it 'cause we find out

15:09.996 --> 15:14.435
whether we have subfloor,
or what is it?

15:14.478 --> 15:17.133
-What is it? We don't know yet.
-SABRINA: Oh, no.

15:17.177 --> 15:20.180
AARON:
Please let it be hardwood
under there.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.138
-Oh, yeah.
-AARON: That's wood.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.619
-[Sabrina gasps]
-Oh, Sabrina! Hardwood.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.142
Yay!

15:26.186 --> 15:27.970
AARON:
We pulled the carpets up today

15:28.014 --> 15:29.232
in the living room, and we seen

15:29.276 --> 15:30.451
that there was hardwood floor
under there.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.627
I-I never knew
that was even under there.

15:32.670 --> 15:35.412
Why?! Why? Why would they put
carpet on top of this?

15:35.456 --> 15:37.458
-I don't know.
-I've never...
I've never seen this.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.894
It was pretty cool
to see that, and it was...

15:38.938 --> 15:41.375
They said it was still
in pretty good shape, so,

15:41.418 --> 15:43.159
hopefully,
that'll turn out well.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.987
And I'm excited to see
how it's gonna look.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.207
I always love hardwood floors,
so for me,

15:47.250 --> 15:49.383
I'm just so excited
to be able to save these.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.254
-Wow.
-[laughs] â™ª Ooh, ooh!â™ª

15:51.298 --> 15:53.256
-You ever seen someone so happy?
-â™ª Ooh, ooh!â™ª

15:53.300 --> 15:54.692
I got to tell you,
I've literally

15:54.736 --> 15:58.392
never seen Sabrina happier
than she is right now.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.133
Since I'm not a sports person,
what...? Like, Aaron,

16:00.176 --> 16:02.265
what's the touchdown dance?

16:02.309 --> 16:04.050
He's defenseman.
He doesn't score touchdown...

16:04.093 --> 16:06.487
-I know, but...
-I do this. Aah!
-Aah!

16:06.530 --> 16:08.402
SABRINA:
Come on, Rob.
I should be excited. We just

16:08.445 --> 16:10.186
found gold
under the carpet here.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.666
Whatever the dance is,
I'm doing

16:11.709 --> 16:13.624
the touchdown dance right now.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.278
Plus, I know that Aaron has
to do that dance when he, like,

16:15.322 --> 16:18.760
roughs up the quarterback
or whatever you guys call it.

16:18.803 --> 16:19.804
-Oh, yes.
You guys, this is great.
-That's awesome.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.458
The demo's not done yet,

16:21.502 --> 16:23.852
so hopefully Sabrina brings
some of that energy downstairs.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.202
SABRINA:
All right. We have,
like, thousands

16:26.246 --> 16:28.813
-of pounds of weights here.
-I know, like, look at...

16:28.857 --> 16:30.902
These plates here are,
like, 45 pounds.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.730
-I know.
-But we're gonna need you
to move some of this stuff,

16:32.774 --> 16:34.645
-Aaron.
-I would love to,

16:34.689 --> 16:36.778
-but I got to go pick
my kids up from school.
-Oh, come on!

16:36.821 --> 16:38.388
-I got to. I got to.
-Oh, my God.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.869
But I know I'm in good hands
with y'all, I trust y'all, so...

16:40.912 --> 16:42.523
But thank you. I got to go,
though. I got to go get the...

16:42.566 --> 16:44.090
-I got to get the bab...
-Come on, Aaron!

16:44.133 --> 16:45.569
I got to get my babies.
I got to get my babies.

16:45.613 --> 16:46.788
We got to call some move...
I can't lift this thing.

16:46.831 --> 16:47.876
You couldn't even
do the bench,

16:47.919 --> 16:49.269
-or the chest press.
-ROB: Aah!

16:49.312 --> 16:50.879
-[weight clanks]
-ROB: No chance.

16:50.922 --> 16:53.055
-SABRINA: Come on.
-ROB: No.

16:53.099 --> 16:56.145
Since Aaron had to go
pick up his kids,

16:56.189 --> 16:58.408
and Sabrina and I couldn't
handle moving all

16:58.452 --> 17:00.323
of those weights downstairs
on our own,

17:00.367 --> 17:01.890
we've got
some much-needed muscle

17:01.933 --> 17:03.239
giving us a hand later today.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.589
-All right, Rob.
-All right.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.590
So I feel like this whole room
needs a face-lift.

17:07.635 --> 17:09.157
In the living room,
we know that we're going

17:09.202 --> 17:10.420
to have good hardwood floors,

17:10.464 --> 17:12.248
but it needs much more updating
than that.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.858
So we're going to replace
the mantel on the fireplace

17:14.903 --> 17:16.905
and then add stylish new tile.

17:16.948 --> 17:19.386
Then I'll surround it with
beautiful built-in cabinets.

17:20.256 --> 17:23.694
So there's a ton
of weight down here.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.174
SABRINA:
So we have our plan
for the fireplace,

17:25.218 --> 17:26.567
and our muscle just showed up

17:26.609 --> 17:28.221
to move around the weights
in the dungeon.

17:28.263 --> 17:29.787
-Come on, guys.
-MAN: Coming in.

17:29.831 --> 17:30.745
Thank you.

17:30.788 --> 17:33.095
â™ª

17:38.666 --> 17:41.277
Once the weights and the washer
and dryer were cleared out...

17:41.321 --> 17:43.192
[grunts, laughs]

17:43.236 --> 17:45.107
...we had to move the rack.

17:45.151 --> 17:48.241
But it had so much rust on it,

17:48.284 --> 17:49.285
I had to grind off the bolts.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.681
Then I could bring in
my carpenters

17:53.724 --> 17:55.944
to replace the windows
and frame the furnace

17:55.987 --> 17:57.641
and the hot water heater,

17:57.685 --> 18:00.035
which will make this space
feel so much nicer.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.385
And spending time down here

18:02.429 --> 18:03.604
gave me a great idea.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.127
-Hey, Sabrina?
-Yeah.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.042
Right here--
the inspirational quote.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.218
And just like
in an NFL locker room,

18:09.262 --> 18:10.959
we'll hang a motivational quote

18:11.002 --> 18:13.483
that you can tap
on the way down.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.529
This way, every time
they come down, they can tap it.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.052
I love that idea.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.665
ROB:
We're making progress
turning this residential house

18:21.709 --> 18:23.450
into the dream clubhouse,

18:23.493 --> 18:25.756
perfectly designed
for the Donald family.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.064
Once we finished painting
the living room,

18:29.108 --> 18:32.937
we sanded all the floors
and applied a beautiful stain.

18:32.981 --> 18:36.332
And we've been installing
new cabinets everywhere--

18:36.376 --> 18:39.509
around the fireplace,
in the kitchen,

18:39.553 --> 18:42.469
and in the updated sink area
in the dungeon.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.908
Plus, I have the electricians
working all over the house.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.562
And Aaron and I

18:48.605 --> 18:49.476
are in the basement
running some new lines.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.871
This way,
we'll get some light down here.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.177
Even though I know
it's a dungeon,

18:55.221 --> 18:58.180
I feel like a little bit
of light

18:58.224 --> 18:59.877
is going to brighten it up.

18:59.921 --> 19:01.314
Think your dad's going
to like this?

19:01.357 --> 19:03.142
I think he's going
to love it, man.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.537
Yeah. Did a lot of work
in this dungeon, man.

19:09.322 --> 19:11.280
Worked at Duquesne
from down here.

19:11.324 --> 19:12.934
Well, let's see
if the good dungeon gets

19:12.977 --> 19:14.153
a little bit
of light to it now.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.764
Oh, wow.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.983
-What do you think?
-Wow.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.246
-Brightened it up?
-We ain't got to work...

19:20.289 --> 19:21.551
We ain't got to work out
in the dark no more.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.205
We ain't got
to work out in the dark no more.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.554
ARCHIE JR.:
Hey, y'all down there?

19:24.598 --> 19:26.730
Yeah, we down here.
We down here.

19:26.774 --> 19:28.906
ROB:
We have so much to do
in this renovation

19:28.950 --> 19:30.299
that we reached out

19:30.343 --> 19:32.606
to Aaron's brother Archie Jr.
for a little help.

19:32.649 --> 19:35.130
-What the heck?
-This is the famous Archie?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.132
Yeah, that's big bro.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.742
Oh, look how bright
it is down here.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.788
I'm Rob.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.485
He's in on the surprise for Dad,
but he really doesn't know

19:42.529 --> 19:44.008
everything
that we're working on here.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.229
This is a new rubber floor
we got.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.144
-Good with puzzles?
-I'm all right with puzzles.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.015
I can make it work.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.540
-It's like a Survivorchallenge.
-[laughing]

19:53.583 --> 19:56.543
ARCHIE JR.:
These some strong rubber mats

19:56.586 --> 19:58.414
-compared to what we had, huh?
-You like it?

19:58.458 --> 19:59.763
AARON:
That's 'cause they legit, man.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.767
ROB:
So what do you think

20:03.811 --> 20:06.030
Dad's going to say about
this whole transformation?

20:06.074 --> 20:07.858
I think he might shed
a few tears over it, man,

20:07.902 --> 20:09.860
'cause he got no clue,
nothing's going on.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.340
So for him to walk in
and be surprised by,

20:11.384 --> 20:12.950
you know, everything.

20:12.994 --> 20:15.344
Definitely come down
to the dungeon

20:15.388 --> 20:17.085
where, you know,
he started us working out.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.566
And so it's gonna-- I think
he's gonna shed a few tears.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.394
He did so much for us
growing up as kids

20:21.437 --> 20:23.004
and-and did so much
to provide for us

20:23.047 --> 20:24.745
and put us in positions
where we are today.

20:24.788 --> 20:26.790
To be able to do something
like this,

20:26.834 --> 20:28.879
and-and I think he's gonna be
real emotional.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.533
Well, we got a lot more to do,
so let's get to it.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.492
Get to work.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.450
SABRINA:
We have a lot to get done

20:34.494 --> 20:35.843
here at the clubhouse,

20:35.886 --> 20:37.148
and today we're starting

20:37.192 --> 20:39.716
by bringing that old fireplace
back to life.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.109
Once the backer board is up,

20:41.152 --> 20:43.329
we're going to start
by laying on new tile,

20:43.372 --> 20:45.809
and I think it's going to look
great in the living room.

20:45.853 --> 20:48.595
And we're adding new floor
in the kitchen.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.554
NISCHELLE:
Hey, don't drop that.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.339
-Hey, Nischelle.
-How you doing?

20:53.382 --> 20:54.557
-Precious cargo.
What's up, y'all?
-ROB: What's going on?

20:54.601 --> 20:56.080
Oh, not much. I was just

20:56.124 --> 20:57.299
walking around.
No, I'm lying.

20:57.343 --> 21:00.084
I just... I-I came over here
for a purpose.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.434
Okay.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.262
You know, I just feel like

21:03.305 --> 21:05.829
I need to take Aaron
on a little field trip.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.396
Oh, we were gonna assemble
this furniture for the dungeon.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.876
I know. I know, I know, I know,
I know. Listen, I'm gonna

21:08.919 --> 21:10.181
take him. We're going to go
over to the high school.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.444
-Oh, that'll be cool.
-Yeah, and we only have

21:11.487 --> 21:12.488
a little bit of time.
We only have a certain window

21:12.532 --> 21:13.663
'cause I think
they're practicing

21:13.707 --> 21:15.099
-and doing some stuff
over there.
-Okay.

21:15.143 --> 21:16.623
So, yeah, so I got
to get him in and out.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.321
All right, see y'all.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.497
-All right,
what was Penn Hills like?
-Coming from

21:21.541 --> 21:23.847
the inner city, then going
to Penn Hills is more like...

21:23.891 --> 21:25.849
You know, Penn Hills is more
like the suburbs.

21:25.893 --> 21:28.069
So, for me, it was like...
like the movies.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.940
-Yeah.
-Like, you, you know,
you're the football player.

21:29.984 --> 21:31.899
You wear your letterman's jacket
in school.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.944
Now look at you.
You're the Super Bowl champ now.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.555
-There we go. I'll take that.
-Go back. Right?

21:35.598 --> 21:37.034
-I'll take that.
-NISCHELLE: Oh, any day.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.122
So, this is your high school?

21:38.166 --> 21:40.211
-AARON: Yes.
-All right.

21:40.255 --> 21:42.257
-When you walk in here,
does it take you right back?
-100%.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.260
-We was grinding at it.
-Oh.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.436
-Old school.
-This is my rack right here.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.134
-This is your rack.
-This is where all

21:50.178 --> 21:51.484
the hard work was coming.
This is Coach Gibs,

21:51.527 --> 21:53.529
my high school D line coach.

21:53.573 --> 21:56.097
He was the one that gave me all
the tricks in-in high school.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.272
-You know, he the one...
-Oh. Is there a signature move

21:57.316 --> 21:58.926
that you do today

21:58.969 --> 22:00.362
-that he gave?
-The swim move.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.495
-It's the quick swim.
-Okay. Wait. So I'm...

22:02.538 --> 22:03.974
If I'm down here, this is
a three-point stance, right?

22:04.018 --> 22:06.325
-Three-point stance.
-Okay, and I get up.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.022
-It's just boom, boom, boom.
-And you just get 'em

22:08.065 --> 22:10.329
-out of the way?
-Yeah, do the quick swim.

22:10.372 --> 22:11.591
-Coach Gib gave you that?
All right.
-Yeah.

22:11.634 --> 22:12.766
Yeah, that was my go-to move
in high school.

22:12.809 --> 22:14.071
He-he put me on that early.

22:14.115 --> 22:15.812
-So...
-I love it. I love it.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.771
He was just
an inspiration for you.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.599
Yeah, he's the one
that got...

22:19.642 --> 22:20.556
got up on me and really...

22:20.600 --> 22:22.297
-He believed in you?
-Yeah.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.559
-And-and...
-I love that.

22:23.603 --> 22:26.040
-Demond Gibson. Cool.
-That's my guy.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.650
-All right.
-So this was my locker room.

22:27.694 --> 22:30.436
38 and 39. This was me.

22:30.479 --> 22:34.091
-So why did you get two?
-I was a senior.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.745
-[laughs]
-Yeah. You get that senior love.

22:35.789 --> 22:37.268
I love taking a walk
down memory lane,

22:37.312 --> 22:39.183
seeing where you started.

22:39.227 --> 22:41.055
Love that you're doing
this surprise for your dad.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.491
And I got a surprise
for you, too.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.319
-For me?
-Come on.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.843
You can't be the only one
giving surprises around here.

22:46.887 --> 22:49.542
-What-what you got for me?
-Come on.

22:49.585 --> 22:50.456
NISCHELLE:
All right.

22:50.499 --> 22:52.109
-Oh!
-The champ is here.

22:52.153 --> 22:55.156
-[laughs]
-The champ is here!
-Surprise!

22:55.199 --> 22:58.725
-The champ is here.
-Hello, Coach Gibs.
-Hi.

22:58.768 --> 23:01.815
-[laughs]
-Looking good, man.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.036
-Yeah.
-Hi.
-What's up, man?

23:06.080 --> 23:07.386
-That's what y'all doing?
-Hello to you in person.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.475
How you doing? How you doing?
Nice to see you.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.564
Listen, this guy came
all the way from Florida.

23:11.607 --> 23:12.869
-I had to.
-Wow. What's up, man?

23:12.913 --> 23:14.393
DEMOND:
I'm very proud of Aaron,

23:14.436 --> 23:16.612
all his accomplishments.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.701
Uh, it gives me great pride
just to know that

23:18.745 --> 23:21.661
I had a little bit to do
with some of his success.

23:21.704 --> 23:24.707
He was telling me that you were
such an inspiration

23:24.751 --> 23:26.448
and taught him
just about everything he knows.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.319
What'd you see in him?

23:28.363 --> 23:32.106
Naturally, he had the speed,
the quickness and the attitude.

23:32.149 --> 23:35.022
And so, when I seen it,
I recognized it right away.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.937
Like, okay, this-this kid
is a little bit different.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.243
It was like I was teaching him
something on Tuesday,

23:39.287 --> 23:42.072
and he'd come back Thursday,
and he was a master at it.

23:42.116 --> 23:43.857
He got it.
Did you, like, go to his dad

23:43.900 --> 23:46.729
and say,
"Listen, this is a special kid?"

23:46.773 --> 23:48.122
His dad was always
here at practice,

23:48.165 --> 23:49.036
so I didn't have to find him.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.124
He stood right up on the hill.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.386
-Oh, he did?
-Every practice.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.127
-NISCHELLE: I love it.
-So I caught him

23:53.170 --> 23:55.346
coming down the-the track here
and stopped him,

23:55.390 --> 23:57.392
like, "Uh, Mr. Arch,
I need to holler at you.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.525
-I need to be able
to coach your son hard."
-Mm-hmm.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.701
-And I asked him for permission
to coach him hard.
-Nice.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.486
And he trusted me. I-I remember
what your dad said. He said,

24:04.530 --> 24:06.749
-"You do
whatever Coach Gib tell you."
-AARON: Mm-hmm.

24:06.793 --> 24:09.186
-And he's like, "Don't come home
and tell me nothing."
-Yup.

24:09.230 --> 24:11.754
And he said, "All right, Dad."
And the rest is history.

24:11.798 --> 24:14.148
You coached up a Hall of Famer.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.889
Listen, that's-that's why
I retired, like, you know.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.456
-[laughter]
-If-if you coached
the best player in the world,

24:17.499 --> 24:19.936
-you might as well stop there.
-You walk away. Mic drop.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.808
-[laughter]
-All right, I do got
to get you back.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.766
-AARON: Okay.
-And thank you so much
for coming.

24:23.810 --> 24:26.421
-DEMOND: Thank you. Thank you.
-This has been such a treat.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.597
-Such a treat. Yes!
-[laughs]

24:30.817 --> 24:33.036
Aaron's hard work continues.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.516
-Watch them fingers.
-Okay.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.518
NISCHELLE:
And with only one week to go,

24:36.562 --> 24:38.389
the thought
on everyone's mind is,

24:38.433 --> 24:40.870
will the fake documentary story
they told Dad

24:40.914 --> 24:44.787
keep him away from the house and
the dungeon until Reveal Day?

24:51.315 --> 24:54.884
It's a dream come true. I
dreamed about this for so long.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.973
So to be here right now,
it's surreal, man.

24:57.017 --> 24:59.498
-We're world champions!
-[air horn toots]

24:59.541 --> 25:02.370
NISCHELLE:
With all the awards
and now a Super Bowl title,

25:02.413 --> 25:05.547
L.A. Rams' Aaron Donald credits
his dad for his success

25:05.591 --> 25:07.027
on and off the field.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.724
I bet you guys thought
this backyard

25:08.768 --> 25:10.900
was so big
when you were growing up.

25:10.944 --> 25:12.032
This was the ball field
right here.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.947
Wait.
This was your football field?

25:13.990 --> 25:16.515
-Yes.
-For sure.
-Oh, my gosh. Okay.

25:16.558 --> 25:17.733
AARON:
We have fences back there.

25:17.777 --> 25:18.908
If you touched the fence
right there,

25:18.952 --> 25:20.388
-that was a touchdown.
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.564
There's a pole right there.
That was the first down.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.174
NISCHELLE:
Now, in his dad's honor...

25:24.218 --> 25:26.046
-Watch them fingers.
-Okay.
-...Aaron's renovating

25:26.089 --> 25:30.006
his childhood home, where his
journey to a champion began.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.400
-Think I'll put you
on the crew, Aaron.
-Ah. Look at that.

25:32.443 --> 25:33.575
I do it all. I do it all.

25:35.751 --> 25:39.363
ROB: We started out
super early this morning,

25:39.407 --> 25:42.453
and we got a lot of the painting
done inside.

25:42.497 --> 25:45.021
Outside, Aaron and I decided
that since

25:45.065 --> 25:48.111
we're pretty much redoing
the whole house,

25:48.155 --> 25:50.853
we couldn't leave the backyard
as is.

25:50.897 --> 25:53.421
So we replaced the old porch
with some new composite decking,

25:53.464 --> 25:54.901
we added a new brick patio...

25:54.944 --> 25:58.034
Nice little patio back here now.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.515
-Got a nice little hangout place
after the workout.
-Uh-huh.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.257
...and repainted everything
to tie the whole look together.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.042
-This looks good.
-Uh-huh.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.088
All right, well, when you do
finish up with the painting,

26:08.131 --> 26:10.656
if you can come inside, I got
a few more things we got to do.

26:10.699 --> 26:14.529
In the kitchen,
the new countertops went in.

26:16.879 --> 26:19.534
We added a new sink.

26:19.578 --> 26:24.104
Now Aaron can help us
with the backsplash.

26:24.147 --> 26:27.716
All right, this, uh, mastic is
on. It's ready for the tile.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.458
-You know, looking good.
-You got that last piece?

26:30.501 --> 26:33.983
That goes in just one at a time.

26:34.027 --> 26:36.856
There you go.
And then slowly push it down.

26:36.899 --> 26:39.249
Perfect. Who knew?

26:39.293 --> 26:40.642
Aaron Donald,

26:40.686 --> 26:43.297
stonemason/tile man.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.081
Slash Super Bowl champion.
Do it all.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.343
Slash Super Bowl champion.

26:46.387 --> 26:47.693
We do it all, baby.
We do it all.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.391
Man, I wish you just played
for the Patriots.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.306
Then everything
would be perfect.

26:52.349 --> 26:53.916
Okay, one more piece.
I got to get some more,

26:53.960 --> 26:55.352
uh, mastic, so I'll do that.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.746
-Okay.
-And, uh, we'll finish up.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.182
-AARON: We're good, though.
-It looks great, though, huh?

26:59.226 --> 27:01.532
It's amazing. Huge difference.

27:01.576 --> 27:04.231
Look amazing, man.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.322
There you go.

27:08.365 --> 27:10.716
This is a bonding agent for
when, uh, we put the threshold

27:10.759 --> 27:12.543
-at the bottom of the tile.
-Okay.

27:12.587 --> 27:15.329
We got to add
a little bit more water.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.418
Just a splash.
There you go.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.289
-Hey, Aaron.
-Oh, look at this.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.943
-Hey, family.
-We have guests.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.642
-Y'all ready?
-I want to see it.

27:23.685 --> 27:26.688
ROB:
So, Erin's wife and kids
came by to say hi.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.734
They obviously know
what we're up to,

27:28.777 --> 27:30.692
so we let them have
a little peek at the renovation.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.912
-Whole different kitchen,
isn't it?
-Oh, my gosh.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.784
-A real fridge.
-[laughs]

27:35.828 --> 27:38.091
This looks so good.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.484
Look at the cabinets.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.835
-What do you think?
-There's a new microwave.

27:42.878 --> 27:45.272
-AARON: Yes.
-Oh. You noticed that first,
huh?

27:45.315 --> 27:47.143
ROB:
But I realized

27:47.187 --> 27:48.928
the clock is still ticking,

27:48.971 --> 27:52.148
so the more Donalds means
the more help for me.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.367
Hold on. Ready?
Go ahead.

27:53.410 --> 27:54.847
[drilling]

27:54.890 --> 27:56.413
Easy. Easy. Yeah.

27:56.457 --> 27:57.937
There you go.
A little bit at a time.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.243
A.J., we should have had you
working with Daddy.

28:00.287 --> 28:01.723
-You're helping.
-I know, man.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.247
You're a better worker
than Daddy.

28:04.291 --> 28:07.163
-Daddy keeps having
to go somewhere.
-[laughter]

28:07.207 --> 28:09.078
Good job. Give me five.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.386
You're taking a long time
on this tile floor.

28:12.429 --> 28:13.648
NISCHELLE:
The team is running

28:13.692 --> 28:14.693
out of time
on this renovation...

28:14.736 --> 28:15.737
There's a lot of little things

28:15.781 --> 28:16.782
that need to get done.

28:16.825 --> 28:18.218
...but eventually

28:18.261 --> 28:19.132
get everything in place...

28:19.175 --> 28:20.350
Oh, wow.

28:20.394 --> 28:21.700
-...before Archie arrives...
-Hi.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.353
This is not a documentary.

28:23.397 --> 28:26.617
...and learns the big secret
we've all been keeping from him.

28:33.668 --> 28:34.756
NISCHELLE:
Our two weeks in Pittsburgh

28:34.800 --> 28:36.366
are coming to a close.

28:36.410 --> 28:38.455
Aaron's father Archie is coming

28:38.499 --> 28:40.849
to the house tomorrow to shoot
what he thinks is his scene

28:40.893 --> 28:42.198
in our fake documentary.

28:42.242 --> 28:46.333
And, boy,
is he going to be surprised.

28:46.376 --> 28:49.031
We've got a list of things
to finish before the big reveal.

28:49.075 --> 28:51.338
You're taking a long time
on this tile floor.

28:51.381 --> 28:54.776
Well, it's funny how you show up
right when I'm about to be done.

28:54.820 --> 28:57.474
Do you know how much more work
I've done around here?

28:57.518 --> 29:00.129
ROB:
The end of these renovations
is always like this.

29:00.173 --> 29:02.436
There's a ton of little things
to finish up.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.179
-Ooh. Is this the right color?
-Yeah, this is fine. It'll...

29:06.222 --> 29:08.355
You just have to put,
like, 75 coats of it.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.357
-Okay, perfect.
I got nothing but time.
-[laughs]

29:10.400 --> 29:12.446
ROB:
We're only revealing tomorrow.

29:12.489 --> 29:14.796
I hope
you didn't make plans tonight.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.798
It's actually coming together
pretty good.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.626
Which part is your favorite?

29:18.669 --> 29:22.238
The dungeon is a big difference
from what it was before.

29:22.282 --> 29:24.675
Wait a minute.
Out of everything in this house,

29:24.719 --> 29:26.721
you're not telling me
the poker room is your favorite?

29:26.765 --> 29:28.723
I mean, of course
that's my favorite,

29:28.767 --> 29:30.812
-you know?
-You're the poker dude.

29:30.856 --> 29:33.989
Did you know that Rob has won
over $150,000 playing poker?

29:34.033 --> 29:35.817
Like, he's the real deal.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.253
Sabrina, I'm working here.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.820
I guess all that practice lying

29:38.864 --> 29:40.300
on Survivor
is really paying off.

29:40.343 --> 29:41.823
I want to play poker with them
on that table.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.477
That's not
an overnight thing, Sabrina.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.088
Oh. I'm gonna have a full house.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.829
-Maybe Go Fish for you.
-We're gonna have a full house

29:47.873 --> 29:50.310
-soon, get it?
You know, like, get it?
-[laughs]

29:57.491 --> 29:59.275
-Sabrina, right in the middle
with this?
-Yeah.

29:59.319 --> 30:01.016
There are gonna be two
right next to each other.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.801
NISCHELLE:
So, Aaron, FYI,

30:02.844 --> 30:04.846
when we get done doing this,
Sabrina's gonna come

30:04.890 --> 30:07.457
-behind us and, like,
change it all.
-ROB: Change it.

30:07.501 --> 30:10.765
-Every time without fail.
-Yeah.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.636
You know, I should be upset
with them saying that,

30:12.680 --> 30:15.248
but, uh, it's true.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.858
I want to come here
after my workout.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.512
ROB:
Now, this is a heavy-duty bike.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.253
Supposed to be
for professional athletes.

30:20.296 --> 30:22.342
-Give it a shot.
-NISCHELLE: Anybody seen
a professional athlete?

30:22.385 --> 30:24.039
-[laughter]
-Me!

30:24.083 --> 30:26.085
Oh, yeah!

30:26.128 --> 30:27.869
I think everything is beautiful,
but the dungeon, you know...

30:27.913 --> 30:30.002
-Squeeze it.
-AARON: That workout space is...

30:30.045 --> 30:31.830
-that's our little sanctum.
-All right.
-Dig it.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.266
-Let's finish the rest
of the rooms.
-All right, let's go.

30:33.309 --> 30:35.703
SABRINA:
This is my favorite part--

30:35.746 --> 30:38.880
to add all the little elements
to make it fun and comfortable.

30:38.924 --> 30:41.100
Now it's like
a great hangout for the boys.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.319
Looking good.

30:43.363 --> 30:44.581
Aaron, come here,
check this out.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.148
Got a little surprise for you.

30:46.192 --> 30:49.935
-Oh, wow.
-We got your number on there.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.762
A real-deal,
professional poker table.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.721
Look at this.

30:53.764 --> 30:55.462
It was super cool,
got the 99 in the middle of it.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.507
-Looks good?
You got it. You got it.
-Look amazing. I love it.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.596
AARON:
I'm just excited to,
after a hard day's work

30:59.640 --> 31:01.381
in the dungeon, coming up
and chilling with the guys

31:01.424 --> 31:02.904
and-and, you know,
getting to use it.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.036
ROB:
I think right here.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.167
That way when you go down...

31:05.211 --> 31:06.908
AARON:
Give it a little smack.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.389
Growing up as a kid,
we wanted to imitate my dad.

31:09.432 --> 31:10.999
He was a role model to us.
You know, that's one

31:11.043 --> 31:12.435
of the main reasons why
I wanted to lift weights

31:12.479 --> 31:14.437
and get strong,
because my dad had muscles,

31:14.481 --> 31:15.525
so I wanted to have muscles.

31:15.569 --> 31:17.527
"Man made it, man can lift it."

31:17.571 --> 31:19.094
I think Dad'll be proud.
What do you think?

31:19.138 --> 31:20.791
He will. Looking good.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.535
It is time.

31:25.579 --> 31:28.451
So, Aaron's brother is
on his way here now with Archie,

31:28.495 --> 31:30.845
and this whole charade
is almost over.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.934
I am so excited.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.457
-This is it--
the moment of truth.
-I know.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.285
I wonder what he's saying
in the car right now,

31:36.329 --> 31:37.939
-'cause he still knows nothing,
so he's probably...
-Nothing at all.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.375
-Yeah.
-AARON: I told him today
that we finished up

31:39.419 --> 31:41.247
the last scene
of the documentary,

31:41.290 --> 31:42.726
and it's gonna be me,
um, him and my brother

31:42.770 --> 31:45.294
that's going to do the last
scene of the documentary

31:45.338 --> 31:47.818
in-inside the dungeon,
so he-he has no clue.

31:47.862 --> 31:49.908
He knows he's going to be on TV,
so he won't be freaked out.

31:49.951 --> 31:54.042
I know you're missing your gym.
I miss it, too,

31:54.086 --> 31:56.479
-going down there, getting
some little extra work in.
-Yeah.

31:56.523 --> 31:59.178
You realize how much
you miss it and how-how much

31:59.221 --> 32:01.832
-you use it, too.
-Yeah. Yeah.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.051
-Feel his heart.
See if he's beating hard.
-I know, right?

32:03.095 --> 32:04.748
-Yeah, it is beating too fast.
-It is?

32:04.792 --> 32:05.967
Yeah. I ain't gonna lie.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.055
-He is a little.
-Do-do, do-do.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.535
Started getting a little

32:08.578 --> 32:10.145
sweaty palms and things
like that, so it felt like,

32:10.189 --> 32:12.669
um, like it was game day
a little bit.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.584
-Hi.
-Oh, he all dressed up.

32:14.628 --> 32:17.065
NISCHELLE:
Look at him. Oh, he is.

32:17.109 --> 32:17.936
He's got on a collared shirt

32:17.979 --> 32:18.719
and everything.

32:18.762 --> 32:21.330
â™ª

32:24.029 --> 32:26.161
-What up, Dad?
-What's up, big man?

32:26.205 --> 32:28.033
How's my big boy, man?

32:28.076 --> 32:30.209
I'm good, man.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.601
This ain't a documentary,
though.

32:31.645 --> 32:34.648
-What?
-[Aaron laughs]

32:34.691 --> 32:36.650
-ROB: Yeah, we're not doing
a documentary.
-It's not a documentary.

32:36.693 --> 32:38.826
-I want to introduce you
to a couple people, okay?
-Okay.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.349
-This is Sabrina Soto.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.394
-Hi, Sabrina...
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

32:41.437 --> 32:44.310
-She is our lead designer.
-Okay.

32:44.353 --> 32:45.528
This is Rob Mariano,
"Boston Rob."

32:45.572 --> 32:47.095
How are you, sir?
Pleasure to meet you.

32:47.139 --> 32:50.620
He's our lead contractor.
And this is not a documentary.

32:50.664 --> 32:53.058
What this is is,
a few weeks ago

32:53.101 --> 32:54.755
I called Aaron, and I said,

32:54.798 --> 32:57.976
"I want you to be a part
of this show that we're doing.

32:58.019 --> 33:02.154
"Is there anybody that you
want to say thank you to?

33:02.197 --> 33:06.245
"Anybody that you want to
do something good for

33:06.288 --> 33:08.247
that's made a difference
in your life?"

33:08.290 --> 33:11.032
And he automatically said,
"My dad."

33:11.076 --> 33:12.338
So for the last couple weeks,

33:12.381 --> 33:13.513
we have been here
at this house

33:13.556 --> 33:16.777
-renovating this home.
-[Aaron laughs]

33:16.820 --> 33:19.214
Renovating this space.

33:19.258 --> 33:21.521
-Renovating the dungeon.
-No.

33:21.564 --> 33:23.914
-SABRINA: Yes.
-As a gift from Aaron to you.

33:25.742 --> 33:27.353
-No.
-NISCHELLE: Yes.

33:27.396 --> 33:29.268
What are you thinking
right now?

33:29.311 --> 33:30.878
-AARON:
His eyes watering a little bit.
-NISCHELLE: Is it?

33:30.921 --> 33:32.445
-No, this is great.
-NISCHELLE: Aw.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.577
You haven't even seen it yet.

33:34.621 --> 33:38.146
-Well, Archie's in on it, too.
-ARCHIE: Come on, Arch.
-[laughter]

33:38.190 --> 33:39.321
ROB:
We put these guys to work,
though.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.541
[laughter]

33:42.716 --> 33:44.196
You ready to go see
your new space?

33:44.239 --> 33:45.762
-Yes.
-Let's do it.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.373
-ROB: Enjoy it.
-Thank you.

33:47.416 --> 33:48.678
-Yeah, check it out.
-SABRINA:
See you in a minute.

33:48.722 --> 33:50.506
I was excited for him
to see it.

33:50.550 --> 33:52.682
He's a guy that really don't
like to be surprised too much,

33:52.726 --> 33:54.510
but I think he might shed
a few tears.

33:54.554 --> 33:55.468
Wow!

34:02.388 --> 34:04.346
Archie Donald...

34:04.390 --> 34:06.566
welcome to your new space.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.350
-[Aaron laughs]
-Oh...

34:08.393 --> 34:10.612
â™ª

34:10.657 --> 34:12.485
-Aw...
-AARON: The red gone.

34:12.527 --> 34:14.574
Look it, the red carpet's gone.

34:14.617 --> 34:17.577
-Oh, look at the floor.
-AARON: Look at it.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.059
-Aw, man.
-[Aaron laughs]

34:21.101 --> 34:21.929
ARCHIE:
Thank you, son.

34:21.972 --> 34:24.018
-Aw.
-Thank you, son.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.020
A whole different house inside,
don't it look like it?

34:26.063 --> 34:27.587
Wow!

34:27.630 --> 34:30.719
-All this in that
short period of time?
-Yes, sir.

34:30.764 --> 34:33.592
NISCHELLE:
Do you remember what
this used to look like?

34:35.333 --> 34:37.858
ARCHIE:
It looks beautiful in here.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.382
Thank y'all very much.
Thank you so much.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.949
Two things that won me over
right away,

34:42.993 --> 34:44.603
if I hadn't seen nothing else,

34:44.647 --> 34:46.431
was the floors

34:46.475 --> 34:49.478
and the couches that used
to have the plastic on it.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.741
So it just looks like
a totally new home in here.

34:51.784 --> 34:53.960
I could've never dreamt this.

34:54.004 --> 34:55.876
NISCHELLE:
So we wanted
to make a space where,

34:55.918 --> 34:57.747
you know, the fellas can hang.

34:57.791 --> 35:00.054
-ARCHIE: Clubhouse.
-NISCHELLE: Yes, yes.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.491
-Archie's clubhouse.
-The clubhouse.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.014
-Wow.
-Yeah.

35:04.058 --> 35:06.321
â™ª

35:07.366 --> 35:09.542
AARON:
Look at the fireplace, Dad.

35:09.585 --> 35:12.066
ARCHIE:
That's your fireplace, isn't it?

35:15.374 --> 35:17.376
-Thank you so much.
-Yeah, listen.

35:17.419 --> 35:20.379
We're so glad you're happy.
We're so glad.

35:20.422 --> 35:22.207
I know it probably
takes a minute to figure out,

35:22.250 --> 35:23.730
like, what everything is

35:23.773 --> 35:25.993
because it looks
so completely different.

35:26.036 --> 35:26.994
Different. Yes, it does.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.169
Look at the big mirror

35:28.213 --> 35:29.736
that was there, that was gone.

35:29.779 --> 35:31.085
That little light's there
for real now.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.260
AARON:
They actually work now, right?

35:32.304 --> 35:34.306
ARCHIE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:34.349 --> 35:35.959
-We've got a lot more
to show you.
-Okay.

35:36.003 --> 35:36.743
-Ready to see some more?
-All right. Sure.

35:36.786 --> 35:37.700
All right, we're gonna

35:37.744 --> 35:38.701
take you to the dining room.

35:38.745 --> 35:40.181
-Come follow us.
-Okay.

35:40.225 --> 35:43.358
-Oh!
-[Aaron and Nischelle laugh]

35:43.402 --> 35:45.795
-ARCHIE: Poker chips?
-NISCHELLE: Yes.

35:45.839 --> 35:47.667
Look at this table.

35:47.710 --> 35:50.452
-Men's night up in here!
-[laughter]

35:51.932 --> 35:54.804
Y'all did it big class.
Y'all really did.

35:57.372 --> 35:58.939
NISCHELLE:
How about this table?

35:58.982 --> 36:00.897
ARCHIE:
Gee.

36:00.941 --> 36:02.682
But we wanted to make sure
this was signature,

36:02.725 --> 36:04.901
so we had to get
the 99 in here.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.904
-ARCHIE: Okay. Okay.
I didn't even catch any of that.
-[laughter]

36:07.948 --> 36:09.950
NISCHELLE:
Well, you know, one of the
things Aaron said was,

36:09.993 --> 36:12.126
"We don't use this, really,
as a dining room

36:12.170 --> 36:13.171
"when we come over here,

36:13.214 --> 36:14.737
"but we would gather

36:14.781 --> 36:16.348
and play cards."

36:16.391 --> 36:19.220
Oh, no!

36:19.264 --> 36:20.917
-NISCHELLE: He sees the kitchen.
-ARCHIE: Look at my kitchen.

36:20.961 --> 36:22.571
NISCHELLE:
He sees the kitchen.

36:22.615 --> 36:24.269
AARON: So we're looking at
the poker table and everything.

36:24.312 --> 36:26.706
He seen the kitchen, and he kind
of went nuts after he seen...

36:26.749 --> 36:28.751
He said,
"That's my kitchen?"

36:28.795 --> 36:31.624
Pretty!

36:31.667 --> 36:35.062
Aw, thank you all.
Thank you all.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.933
NISCHELLE:
You didn't really use
the kitchen as a kitchen,

36:36.977 --> 36:37.934
but we wanted to make sure

36:37.978 --> 36:39.414
you had a space, right?

36:39.458 --> 36:40.720
-ARCHIE: First class.
-NISCHELLE: Okay.

36:40.763 --> 36:43.940
AARON:
New cabinets,
obviously new walls.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.333
My dad had that house forever,

36:45.377 --> 36:46.639
and we really never did
nothing new to it,

36:46.682 --> 36:49.163
so to see the upgrade we had,
and him

36:49.207 --> 36:50.556
react how he did,
and then see the kitchen,

36:50.599 --> 36:52.253
and he started going
a little nuts, right?

36:52.297 --> 36:54.037
Clubhouse.

36:54.081 --> 36:56.170
AARON:
That's the type of,
you know, emotions

36:56.214 --> 36:57.824
that I expected from him,
and I'm happy that,

36:57.867 --> 36:59.173
you know, we was able
to give that to him.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.957
Tearing all this stuff out.

37:01.001 --> 37:03.395
-Breaking stuff,
pulling it out. Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:03.438 --> 37:04.744
-Oh, he liked demo day.
-[Aaron laughs]

37:04.787 --> 37:05.788
He loved breaking everything.

37:05.832 --> 37:07.181
He get to use them
big muscles.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.313
Absolutely he did.

37:08.356 --> 37:10.184
We actually do have
one more thing

37:10.228 --> 37:12.055
we want to show you outside.

37:12.099 --> 37:13.796
-You got to have an
outdoor space to hang.
-Oh...

37:13.840 --> 37:18.236
ARCHIE:
This is great.
Fireplace outside, man.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.412
Oh, man!

37:20.455 --> 37:23.197
AARON:
Now have a seat.
Check it out, man.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.112
When we went outside
to see the patio,

37:25.155 --> 37:26.679
you know, I could see
my dad's eyes get big,

37:26.722 --> 37:28.246
'cause he didn't know
what to expect.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.986
-Said, "Wait, outside, too?"
-NISCHELLE: This is good.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.423
You can spend your time
out here.

37:31.466 --> 37:34.208
Laid concrete down for me.
Thank you, man.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.906
Got a nice little patio
back there

37:36.950 --> 37:39.387
with the little wood burners.
I always wanted that.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.824
-Oh, man.
-AARON: Looking good.

37:41.868 --> 37:44.392
ARCHIE:
Oh, it really looks nice.

37:44.436 --> 37:45.785
NISCHELLE:
Well, you know,
this isn't all.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.613
-We have one more thing.
-Okay.

37:47.656 --> 37:49.441
You ready? Let's go.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.574
There we go.

37:52.618 --> 37:54.881
"Man made it,
man can lift it."

37:54.924 --> 37:57.057
[laughter]

37:57.100 --> 37:58.363
-NISCHELLE: Archie.
-ARCHIE: Yes.

37:58.406 --> 38:01.017
I mean, welcome to
the dungeon 2.0.

38:01.061 --> 38:03.193
Oh, what is this?

38:03.237 --> 38:04.934
Oh!

38:09.548 --> 38:11.201
NISCHELLE: Well, you know,
this isn't all.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.508
-We have one more thing.
-Okay.

38:13.552 --> 38:15.293
You ready? Let's go.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.513
There we go.

38:18.557 --> 38:20.733
ARCHIE:
"Man made it,
man can lift it."

38:20.776 --> 38:22.822
[laughter]

38:22.865 --> 38:24.606
NISCHELLE:
Welcome to the dungeon 2.0.

38:24.650 --> 38:27.870
Oh...

38:27.914 --> 38:31.918
Come on.

38:31.961 --> 38:35.965
Hey. You my big boy, man.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.358
AARON:
The dungeon, baby.

38:37.402 --> 38:40.274
-ARCHIE: What?
-[laughs] The dungeon!

38:40.318 --> 38:43.364
-Get some cardio in now.
-Beautiful.

38:43.408 --> 38:44.887
-Work! Work!
-Beautiful.
-Come on.

38:44.931 --> 38:47.890
-This fan feel good.
-Put that work in.
-[laughter]

38:47.934 --> 38:49.936
AARON:
To see the full picture
of the dungeon,

38:49.979 --> 38:51.677
and once he got down here,

38:51.720 --> 38:54.332
and to see his reaction,
oh, it was priceless.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.855
You can take
all the clothes down now.

38:55.898 --> 38:57.596
You got hampers
and stuff right there.

38:57.639 --> 38:58.684
-You got stuff
to put right there.
-Yes.

38:58.727 --> 38:59.946
You can put
the dirty clothes here.

38:59.989 --> 39:01.513
You don't have to stuff them
in here anymore.

39:01.556 --> 39:03.993
-ARCHIE: Okay.
-You got laundry down here,

39:04.037 --> 39:05.952
so you can wash your towels
and everything.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.649
AARON:
Washer and dryer.
That's a washer and dryer

39:07.693 --> 39:08.955
put into one.

39:08.998 --> 39:10.391
-ARCHIE: Washer anddryer?
-Yes.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.741
And you got the lights.
Now we got lights everywhere.

39:12.785 --> 39:14.308
Oh, I forgot.
Oh, yeah, look at the lights.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.005
AARON:
You got lights everywhere now.

39:16.049 --> 39:16.789
ARCHIE:
We called it the dungeon

39:16.832 --> 39:18.834
'cause it was so dark.

39:18.878 --> 39:21.010
I'm not even sure that I can
call it the dungeon anymore

39:21.054 --> 39:23.230
'cause it's lit up
down there now.

39:23.273 --> 39:24.362
You know what I'm saying?

39:24.405 --> 39:25.406
This look more like your gym.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.408
-[laughter]
-You know?

39:27.452 --> 39:28.540
AARON:
We kept some of
the rusty weights.

39:28.583 --> 39:29.976
ARCHIE:
Okay, okay.

39:30.019 --> 39:31.412
NISCHELLE:
We wanted to make sure

39:31.456 --> 39:34.110
that some of the stuff stayed
because he said

39:34.154 --> 39:36.765
-he wouldn't be
the man he is today...
-Without 'em.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.419
...if it wasn't for the dungeon
that you had here.

39:38.463 --> 39:42.118
So he wanted to make sure
that there was nostalgia.

39:42.162 --> 39:43.119
-Keep some of the
original stuff.
-NISCHELLE: Absolutely.

39:43.163 --> 39:44.991
Some new, some old.

39:45.034 --> 39:46.645
First class.

39:46.688 --> 39:48.690
-So, I'm so glad you love this.
-Oh, I love it.

39:48.734 --> 39:51.389
Everything you did for me,
from, you know,

39:51.432 --> 39:53.216
building me into the man
I am today

39:53.260 --> 39:54.435
to the work ethic
you gave me.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.045
You know, all my success,
you know, go,

39:56.089 --> 39:57.307
obviously, to my family,
but all that,

39:57.351 --> 39:58.744
you know, will come from you.

39:58.787 --> 40:01.181
We do things like this
to, you know, thank you,

40:01.224 --> 40:02.704
but, you know,
thank you ain't enough.

40:02.748 --> 40:05.403
You know, so,
I just love you to death.

40:05.446 --> 40:07.013
Everything you did for me,
you know,

40:07.056 --> 40:10.364
and doing for me
still-still today, so, you know,

40:10.408 --> 40:12.366
I'm here where I'm at
because of you.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.542
-Son...
-I love you, too.

40:14.586 --> 40:17.763
He give me a big hug and, and
tell me how much he love me.

40:17.806 --> 40:20.243
That was definitely
a special moment, you know.

40:20.287 --> 40:22.376
It was like all that hard work
was worth it,

40:22.420 --> 40:24.160
just to see his expression,

40:24.204 --> 40:25.335
the emotion that he shared.

40:25.379 --> 40:26.946
Um, it definitely was heartfelt.

40:26.989 --> 40:29.775
But listen, we can't celebrate,
just the three of us.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.472
Yeah. So we got
the family coming.

40:31.516 --> 40:32.734
-We got to celebrate
with the family, too.
-Yeah.

40:32.778 --> 40:34.432
-Let's go party.
-Let's go.

40:34.475 --> 40:35.998
-Let's go party.
Family's coming.
-Thank you.

40:36.042 --> 40:38.000
Let's go.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.480
NISCHELLE:
The party's already started,
y'all.

40:39.524 --> 40:40.568
You lose.

40:40.612 --> 40:42.831
I think I'm losing,
so it's perfect.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.180
What do you think?
How'd it go.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.225
-I love it, I love it.
-Yeah?

40:45.268 --> 40:46.966
Guys...

40:47.009 --> 40:48.446
-I thought I heard screaming.
-This one got emotional.

40:48.489 --> 40:49.664
-Yes, screaming and tears.
-Okay.

40:49.708 --> 40:51.274
We shed, we shed
a little tears down there.

40:51.318 --> 40:52.798
Both of 'em did.

40:52.841 --> 40:55.235
-I forgot to put Kleenex
down there.
-[laughter]

40:55.278 --> 40:57.019
Oh, there you go.

40:57.063 --> 40:58.630
Well, now you officially

40:58.673 --> 41:00.501
-have your clubhouse.
-Yes, I do.

41:00.545 --> 41:03.199
-You can play and have fun.
-Yes.

41:04.766 --> 41:06.855
AARON:
This is a memory that
I will remember forever.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.683
You know, to be able to
gift my dad with something

41:08.727 --> 41:10.642
like this and be a part of--
you know, helping

41:10.685 --> 41:13.296
to create it, so it was
definitely special.

41:16.169 --> 41:17.910
So, this is my first clubhouse
and dungeon renovation

41:17.953 --> 41:19.302
I have ever done.

41:19.346 --> 41:21.827
But I'm so happy with
the way it turned out.

41:21.870 --> 41:24.699
Now they have a place to make
so many more memories.

41:28.137 --> 41:29.530
I could've never dreamt this.

41:29.574 --> 41:30.923
The changes and
the remodeling

41:30.966 --> 41:31.924
that you guys did.

41:31.967 --> 41:33.795
It's priceless, man.

41:33.839 --> 41:35.536
I think I see your families
coming.

41:35.580 --> 41:36.842
-Okay.
-All right, let's welcome 'em.
-I do.

41:36.885 --> 41:38.539
Hey, family.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.976
Hey, family,
come see the house.

41:41.020 --> 41:43.022
NISCHELLE:
So Aaron invited
his whole family

41:43.065 --> 41:44.284
and Coach Gibs over
to see the new space,

41:44.327 --> 41:45.807
and I think he and his dad

41:45.851 --> 41:48.549
are just gonna love
showing it off.

41:48.593 --> 41:51.552
Red carpet's gone.
Got the wood floors.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.511
-ARCHIE: Got my sign up there.
-Oh...

41:53.554 --> 41:55.556
ARCHIE:
I have a motto.
My motto is this:

41:55.600 --> 41:59.255
expect nothing,
appreciate everything.

41:59.299 --> 42:01.649
-Wow.
-ARCHIE: Whole different gym
now.

42:01.693 --> 42:03.564
If you have no expectations,

42:03.608 --> 42:05.566
all you can do is
appreciate everything.

42:05.610 --> 42:09.527
You'll always win it.
You'll always win it, man.

42:09.570 --> 42:11.093
The dungeon.

42:11.137 --> 42:12.965
I'm so happy how my dad's, um,

42:13.008 --> 42:15.315

from happy to, you know,

42:15.358 --> 42:17.143

a little bit.

42:17.186 --> 42:19.275
-ARCHIE: Yes, ma'am.
-AARON: Feel like,
mission's complete.

42:19.319 --> 42:21.800
You know, it was an amazing,
amazing day.

42:21.843 --> 42:23.497
This is the house
for the family now.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.804
You know, this is for us
to keep forever,

42:25.847 --> 42:26.892
