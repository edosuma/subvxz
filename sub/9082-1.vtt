01:37.839 --> 01:39.840
The Words...

01:40.717 --> 01:42.301
by me.

01:44.179 --> 01:45.972
Part one.

01:48.141 --> 01:52.061
"The old man stood in the rain."

01:54.439 --> 01:59.819
He watched as Rory and Dora Jansen
made their way to the limo.

02:00.529 --> 02:03.698
"Somehow it seemed as if
the raindrops missed them."

02:03.865 --> 02:06.283
- Thank you.
- Good night.

02:41.445 --> 02:45.698
No, no, tell Mom not to worry. Look,
we just want her to feel better, okay?

02:46.158 --> 02:47.199
All right?

02:47.367 --> 02:50.828
Yeah. No, no. She brought her camera.
They're gonna take a lot of pictures.

02:50.996 --> 02:53.789
There's a lot of photographers there.
It's an event, Dad.

02:53.957 --> 02:56.083
Okay, all right, we got... Yes, yes.

02:56.251 --> 02:58.085
- We love you too.
- Love you, Chuckles.

02:58.253 --> 02:59.879
Bye.

03:01.506 --> 03:03.632
My parents are very excited.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.510
And they love you very much.

03:06.678 --> 03:08.721
Are you excited?

03:09.681 --> 03:12.558
Yeah, sure, it's a big night, right?

03:12.726 --> 03:14.685
It's a big honor.

03:16.605 --> 03:18.939
Baby, it's... You're just nervous.
It's normal.

03:19.107 --> 03:21.108
I'm just a little overwhelmed,
you know?

03:21.276 --> 03:23.569
I didn't expect any of this.

03:27.657 --> 03:29.492
Where are you?

03:37.125 --> 03:40.878
It was supposed to be a little book,
you know?

03:41.296 --> 03:42.797
I know.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.762
So nice that you could make time
for our little award.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.098
- We know you're busy.
- The pleasure's all ours.

03:52.265 --> 03:55.559
No. Come now. Your book is fabulous.
But, of course, you know that.

03:55.727 --> 03:57.478
You've read all the reviews.

03:58.271 --> 04:01.982
The Window Tears has introduced us
to the one of the most exciting...

04:02.150 --> 04:03.859
and sensitive young writers...

04:04.027 --> 04:07.071
to appear on the literary horizon
in a very long time.

04:07.239 --> 04:10.116
We are privileged to have with us
here tonight...

04:10.283 --> 04:15.037
the winner of this year's American
Fellowship of Arts and Letters Award...

04:15.205 --> 04:17.581
Mr. Rory Jansen.

04:34.349 --> 04:36.016
Thank you.

04:49.698 --> 04:52.867
I simply tried to set down the truth
as I imagined it.

04:53.034 --> 04:56.412
The story of one man,
his wife and child.

04:56.580 --> 05:01.542
I never thought a little book like this
would affect so many different people.

05:01.710 --> 05:04.253
I only wish I had an idea
for my second book.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.257
I don't want to take up
any more of your time.

05:08.425 --> 05:09.633
I'll just end by saying...

05:09.801 --> 05:14.054
that the honor this evening
is truly all mine. Thank you.

05:30.655 --> 05:34.617
Rory Jansen had everything
he had ever dreamed of.

05:35.660 --> 05:39.788
But somewhere,
the old man was waiting.

05:40.999 --> 05:46.545
And he would change everything.

05:56.890 --> 06:00.476
"Right after college,
they moved to Brooklyn."

06:00.644 --> 06:03.395
They found a first floor loft
in an old factory.

06:03.563 --> 06:07.608
It was five years before the book
and the awards...

06:08.068 --> 06:11.528
"...but Rory already knew what his life
was supposed to look like."

06:11.696 --> 06:13.614
So straight back there.
That's it.

06:13.782 --> 06:15.282
- Keep going?
- Like two more feet.

06:15.450 --> 06:17.451
- Okay, here?
- Yeah.

06:17.619 --> 06:20.246
- Let it go.
- Just let go?

06:28.255 --> 06:29.755
He loved her.

06:29.965 --> 06:31.548
Dora?

06:32.008 --> 06:34.468
- He loved New York.
- You're gonna drop me.

06:38.181 --> 06:41.183
He loved fighting to make the rent.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.645
Fighting to make his art.

06:44.813 --> 06:48.816
Living like all the great writers
he had idolized.

06:49.526 --> 06:52.945
Okay, I think we should put pictures
up there.

06:53.822 --> 06:58.867
And I think your desk is fine
where it's at over there.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.749
And I think we should paint
the bathroom pink.

07:05.917 --> 07:07.543
Never.

07:10.839 --> 07:15.259
"A young, struggling writer
fighting to make his voice heard."

07:18.013 --> 07:20.431
He liked cheap bottles of wine.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.643
- How much is it?
- It's 20 dollars.

07:24.811 --> 07:28.272
And nothing to do with his days
but wander the streets.

07:29.899 --> 07:32.443
It matches my eyes.
What do you want me to do?

07:33.361 --> 07:35.946
But at night,
when the rest of the city slept...

07:38.116 --> 07:39.908
"...he wrote."

07:44.914 --> 07:46.623
Thanks, babe.

07:49.794 --> 07:52.296
Just doing a final pass.

07:52.464 --> 07:53.547
And then what?

07:53.715 --> 07:58.302
And then I'm gonna head into an agent
that Professor Waller recommended.

07:58.803 --> 08:00.512
And then what?

08:00.889 --> 08:02.806
And then we're gonna celebrate.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.684
But we don't have any money.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.853
Then we're gonna celebrate.

08:08.146 --> 08:10.397
Just gotta finish this.

08:13.234 --> 08:15.736
Babe. Babe.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.989
Babe. Come on, I gotta finish this.

08:19.532 --> 08:23.202
- Okay, I gotta finish this.
- Fine.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.413
But you're missing out.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.759
Finished.

08:39.427 --> 08:42.179
Well, if he doesn't want to do it,
he doesn't want to do it.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.723
Listen, I said I'll try.

08:45.767 --> 08:48.227
What do you mean?
Of course that's my word.

08:51.272 --> 08:53.941
I gotta know by Wednesday,
that's when I place the orders.

08:54.109 --> 08:56.110
- I'll call you back. Goodbye.
- Working hard?

08:56.277 --> 08:58.195
All I do is put out fires.
It never stops.

08:58.363 --> 09:02.241
Listen, I know you're busy, so
I'm gonna come at you straight, okay?

09:02.742 --> 09:04.451
Let's go into my office.

09:04.786 --> 09:05.828
How much?

09:05.995 --> 09:08.455
Just enough for the next month
to cover us.

09:08.623 --> 09:11.667
And then what?
You show up again here next month?

09:11.835 --> 09:14.253
I got my book into an agent,
says it's got potential.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.838
Did they give you any money?

09:16.005 --> 09:19.550
No, but, Dad, it doesn't work like that.
It's not like your business, okay?

09:19.717 --> 09:22.386
It's not like you do work,
you get paid for it, okay?

09:22.554 --> 09:27.015
- I gotta pay my dues.
- No, I gotta pay your dues, right?

09:27.350 --> 09:30.519
Look, I wouldn't ask you
if I didn't need it.

09:30.687 --> 09:32.729
You think I like coming down here
like this?

09:32.897 --> 09:34.398
You think I like saying no?

09:35.942 --> 09:38.444
I feel like I'm hurting you
more than helping you.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.696
You gotta take responsibility
for your life.

09:40.864 --> 09:42.865
I've been taking responsibility
for my life.

09:43.032 --> 09:45.325
I've had a job since I was 15.
I was a busboy.

09:45.493 --> 09:47.202
Okay, we decided two years ago...

09:47.370 --> 09:49.621
I was gonna dedicate myself
to being a writer.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.790
We had this conversation
in the living room.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.710
- Mom was right there. She agreed...
- But it's been a while.

09:54.878 --> 09:56.753
So maybe now
this should be a hobby...

09:56.921 --> 09:59.047
instead of a profession
until you get your feet on the ground.

09:59.215 --> 10:01.091
Well, thanks for the encouragement,
Pop.

10:01.259 --> 10:03.051
- What about Dora?
- What about Dora?

10:03.219 --> 10:05.929
Well, I mean, you got to have money
before you get married.

10:07.348 --> 10:09.892
You know what?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

10:10.226 --> 10:13.687
Come here! Hey, sit down! Sit down.

10:13.855 --> 10:16.106
Talking about marriage...?

10:20.028 --> 10:21.278
What are you, 11?

10:30.955 --> 10:33.081
This is the last time.

10:33.416 --> 10:36.418
You gotta get a job,
something steady, support yourself.

10:37.212 --> 10:39.880
That's just part of being a man.

10:42.091 --> 10:44.468
I'm trying to be a man, Dad.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.930
Another part of being a man...

10:48.431 --> 10:53.018
no matter how painful it might be,
is accepting your own limitations.

10:55.313 --> 10:56.730
Come here.

11:00.485 --> 11:03.195
- I love you.
- I love you.

11:04.614 --> 11:07.324
- I'm gonna pay you back, you know.
- Yeah.

11:07.617 --> 11:10.702
Yeah. Hey, you can always work here.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.957
We'd kill each other.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.834
"He continued to write..."

11:18.002 --> 11:20.629
believing he had a story to tell.

11:20.797 --> 11:23.840
He sent his work anywhere
they might publish him.

11:24.008 --> 11:27.928
But all he heard back
was rejection, disinterest...

11:28.096 --> 11:30.472
or the loudest sound of all...

11:30.640 --> 11:32.224
silence.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.894
Finally, the great writer, Rory Jansen...

11:36.062 --> 11:39.439
was forced to take a day job.

11:39.732 --> 11:42.568
He found a position at one
of the biggest publishing houses...

11:42.735 --> 11:45.529
"...in New York,
hoping to make some connections."

11:45.697 --> 11:47.489
I made a million connections here.

11:47.657 --> 11:49.324
- What, you're a writer?
- Yeah.

11:49.492 --> 11:52.494
I got all my stuff into different agents
around here.

11:52.662 --> 11:55.330
I'm actually glad it's taking me a while
to break through.

11:55.498 --> 11:59.376
It's given me a chance to develop
my style, understand the market.

12:00.336 --> 12:02.671
So, what kind of stuff do you write?

12:03.590 --> 12:05.882
Angry young men, I guess.

12:07.010 --> 12:08.343
I used to be like that.

12:08.511 --> 12:10.053
Now I write Sci-Fi.

12:10.221 --> 12:12.180
You mature, you know.
Just give it time.

12:19.647 --> 12:21.690
Are you gonna write tonight?

12:24.485 --> 12:28.655
I'll just stay in and watch a movie
or get food or something.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.073
Okay.

12:30.241 --> 12:34.536
"Without even knowing it,
they had settled into their lives."

12:35.455 --> 12:40.584
And on a Friday afternoon,
they were married at City Hall.

12:41.669 --> 12:45.047
"They honeymooned in Paris."

12:54.891 --> 12:56.725
You ready?

13:00.188 --> 13:01.647
Yup.

13:04.776 --> 13:06.943
Two minutes, okay?

13:07.111 --> 13:09.738
- Just two more minutes.
- No more antique shops.

13:15.703 --> 13:18.288
Thank you. Put that down.

13:19.332 --> 13:23.251
Klondike 474. Repeat 47...

13:52.407 --> 13:55.742
What do you think of this?
It's like some...

13:56.786 --> 13:58.870
That's nice.

13:59.205 --> 14:00.706
What do you think of it?

14:00.873 --> 14:02.332
I think it's old.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.583
I think it's great.

14:03.751 --> 14:06.753
I feel like if we clean it up,
you can use it for work.

14:06.921 --> 14:08.964
- Yeah?
- It's classy.

14:09.507 --> 14:11.508
I'm gonna get it for you.

14:17.181 --> 14:18.265
Thank you, Mrs. Jansen.

14:25.940 --> 14:31.194
They returned to New York,
and the honeymoon was over.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.032
All mail and packages
go to the assistants only.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.784
Hey, Irene.

14:37.952 --> 14:40.829
"And then, with no warning at all...

14:40.997 --> 14:43.790
Rory got the call
that he had been waiting for."

14:43.958 --> 14:45.751
Thank you. Okay.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.919
Thank you very much. All right, okay.

14:49.297 --> 14:53.717
The agent had a reputation for impeccable
taste and discovering young literary stars.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.260
It's good.

14:55.428 --> 14:58.597
It's really good. I mean,
it's a beautiful piece of writing...

14:58.765 --> 15:01.641
and the truth is that you should be
very proud of yourself.

15:01.809 --> 15:04.478
Thank you very much, wow.

15:04.645 --> 15:07.481
- I worked very hard on it.
- The work shows.

15:07.648 --> 15:10.442
I look at you,
I can't believe how young you are.

15:11.027 --> 15:12.277
Well...

15:12.445 --> 15:16.031
I have to tell you, Rory,
I just see so much truth in your work.

15:16.199 --> 15:18.366
I... I am... I'm so impressed.

15:18.534 --> 15:20.952
Wow, I can't believe this. This is...

15:22.747 --> 15:26.792
But unfortunately, the nature of
the publishing business right now...

15:26.959 --> 15:29.461
at this particular time
is such that I don't know...

15:29.629 --> 15:32.047
how to publish a book like this.

15:33.257 --> 15:37.719
Look, Rory, no one is gonna support
a book like this.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.805
- Book like this?
- From an unknown writer.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.348
There's just no market for it.

15:41.516 --> 15:44.518
Now, it's hard for any writer
under any circumstances...

15:44.685 --> 15:47.854
without a track record
to get published. And this book...

15:48.022 --> 15:49.940
I mean, it's so interior.

15:51.943 --> 15:53.902
Interior? What is that?

15:54.070 --> 15:56.446
It's artistic, it's subtle. It's...

15:57.490 --> 15:59.074
It's a piece of art.

15:59.242 --> 16:02.160
So this book, I should just shelve this
and forget about it.

16:02.328 --> 16:04.329
I just... I spent three years
working on it.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.414
I'm just trying to be honest with you.

16:06.582 --> 16:08.917
I'm just telling you the reality
of the situation.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.003
Have patience.

16:12.797 --> 16:17.133
You know, I wouldn't have brought you
in here if I really didn't believe in you.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.746
You're gonna be fine.

19:29.744 --> 19:32.370
So we have two weeks in September.
We're planning a trip.

19:32.538 --> 19:35.498
We think we're gonna charter...
What? We're gonna charter a boat.

19:35.666 --> 19:37.834
We're going to Turks
but we're gonna get a boat.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.544
- Like a 50-footer.
- Nothing crazy.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.963
Great, but it's the first two weeks
of September.

19:42.131 --> 19:43.757
- It's the beginning...
- Get a sub.

19:43.924 --> 19:45.133
You don't wanna miss this.

19:45.301 --> 19:47.802
- This is gonna be truly great.
- It's gonna be amazing.

19:47.970 --> 19:50.138
- Breakfast, lunch, dinner.
- You pull out fish...

19:50.306 --> 19:53.141
right out of the ocean,
they cook them up. It's incredible.

19:53.309 --> 19:56.019
Snorkeling, diving.
Totally different on a boat.

19:57.063 --> 20:00.148
"He couldn't stop thinking
about that story."

20:01.525 --> 20:03.651
Where did it come from?

20:05.154 --> 20:07.238
Who had written it?

20:11.494 --> 20:12.660
In those words...

20:12.828 --> 20:15.580
he had been confronted
by the embodiment of everything...

20:15.748 --> 20:17.665
he had ever aspired to be...

20:17.833 --> 20:21.377
"...and the reality
of what he would never become."

20:21.545 --> 20:23.671
Buddy, what's going on with you, man?

20:23.839 --> 20:25.799
- You're 100 miles away.
- We want you to go.

20:25.966 --> 20:27.717
Why don't you shut up?

20:33.891 --> 20:35.100
Rory!

20:35.267 --> 20:37.227
- What the hell...?
- Oh, don't. Just don't.

20:37.394 --> 20:40.188
- Really, I can't right now.
- What is the matter with you?

20:41.941 --> 20:43.650
I don't...

20:45.569 --> 20:48.363
How the fuck do you end up here?

20:49.490 --> 20:50.532
Rory...

20:50.699 --> 20:53.535
I look at my life, I look at your life,
I look at his life...

20:53.702 --> 20:55.995
I look at my father's,
I look at everybody's...

20:56.163 --> 20:58.832
I don't have a clue
how anybody winds up where they do.

20:58.999 --> 21:00.917
- I don't know.
- You don't have to know.

21:01.085 --> 21:03.419
- I don't know!
- It's okay! You don't have to know.

21:03.587 --> 21:05.505
There's so much time, Rory.

21:05.714 --> 21:07.841
I'm talking about my fucking life here!

21:09.093 --> 21:12.137
- What about your life?
- It's not right!

21:12.304 --> 21:13.513
Nothing's right!

21:17.685 --> 21:20.436
Rory, how is that supposed
to make me feel?

21:22.773 --> 21:25.400
How is that supposed to make me feel?

21:28.154 --> 21:31.197
I'm not who I thought I was, okay?

21:32.074 --> 21:33.491
I'm not.

21:33.659 --> 21:36.786
And I'm terrified that I never will be.

22:02.313 --> 22:04.272
I'm sorry.

22:35.846 --> 22:37.639
It's okay.

23:54.758 --> 23:56.718
"He didn't know why he was doing it."

23:57.845 --> 24:02.015
He just wanted to feel the words
pass through his fingers...

24:02.182 --> 24:03.891
through his mind.

24:10.649 --> 24:14.610
He retyped every word
as it was written on those pages.

24:18.657 --> 24:24.704
He didn't change a period, a comma,
or even correct the spelling mistakes.

25:06.872 --> 25:10.375
He needed to know what it felt like...

25:11.794 --> 25:13.669
to touch it...

25:17.883 --> 25:20.343
"...if only for a moment."

25:42.574 --> 25:44.325
Rory, can you come here?

25:44.493 --> 25:46.285
What's up?

25:46.453 --> 25:49.747
Hey. You all right?

25:50.290 --> 25:52.333
What's wrong, babe?

25:53.210 --> 25:54.335
Hey.

25:54.503 --> 25:56.379
Just kiss me.

26:02.511 --> 26:04.720
Hey, what is it?

26:06.348 --> 26:08.182
- Oh, my God.
- What?

26:09.852 --> 26:10.977
- What?
- Are you pregnant?

26:11.145 --> 26:13.438
No, no, no. I want you to listen to me.

26:14.314 --> 26:17.191
I was working
on the computer today...

26:17.359 --> 26:20.445
and I swear to you I've never gone
through your things before...

26:20.612 --> 26:22.613
but your book was on the screen...

26:22.781 --> 26:25.074
- and I started reading one sentence...
- Oh, no.

26:25.242 --> 26:27.785
Then I read the second,
and I couldn't put it down.

26:27.953 --> 26:32.623
Listen to me. You are everything
you've always wanted to be.

26:34.209 --> 26:35.543
Dora, you don't under...

26:35.711 --> 26:37.879
Why would you keep this a secret
from me?

26:38.046 --> 26:39.088
No, it's not a secret.

26:39.256 --> 26:43.342
These stories, they're so different
from anything you've ever done before.

26:43.510 --> 26:45.553
It's as if you stopped hiding.

26:45.721 --> 26:49.474
They're fuller, they're truer,
they're more honest.

26:50.601 --> 26:53.769
There are parts of you in this novel
that I always knew were there...

26:53.937 --> 26:55.980
but I had never seen before.

26:57.274 --> 26:59.567
- I've never...
- What parts?

27:01.111 --> 27:02.945
What parts?

27:03.363 --> 27:05.072
All of you.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.160
All of you, baby.

27:12.414 --> 27:14.749
This has to be seen.

27:21.673 --> 27:22.965
Just listen to me, okay.

27:23.133 --> 27:28.012
You always said that all you ever
wanted to do was be a good writer.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.515
With this, Rory...

27:30.682 --> 27:33.351
you're a great writer.

27:34.728 --> 27:36.521
Baby...

27:37.731 --> 27:40.816
take it to work
and show it to someone.

27:44.154 --> 27:46.572
And if you're not gonna do it
for yourself...

27:46.740 --> 27:48.783
then please do it for me.

28:19.773 --> 28:22.733
- Sorry to bother you, Mr. Cutler.
- Hey, Rory. How are you today?

28:22.901 --> 28:24.402
- Good.
- Good.

28:24.570 --> 28:25.987
Do you have a minute?

28:27.239 --> 28:29.782
I'm kind of busy here.
What can I do for you?

28:29.950 --> 28:34.245
I've worked here for over two years.
I haven't asked anybody for anything.

28:34.705 --> 28:37.331
I have a feeling you're about to ask
for a thing now.

28:37.499 --> 28:39.792
You see, there's this novel.

28:40.836 --> 28:44.797
And I know that you get submissions
all the time and you're very busy...

28:44.965 --> 28:47.383
but I don't want anything
other than your opinion.

28:47.551 --> 28:49.719
I would really appreciate it.

28:55.892 --> 28:58.519
Days passed.

28:58.687 --> 29:01.272
Weeks became months.

29:02.816 --> 29:07.862
And by the time autumn arrived, Rory
had all but forgotten about the book.

29:09.823 --> 29:10.948
Rory.

29:13.076 --> 29:14.535
Can I help you, Mr. Cutler?

29:14.703 --> 29:17.622
- Come on in here for a second.
- I'm in the middle of training...

29:17.789 --> 29:20.374
Yeah, yeah, he'll find his way back.
Shut the door.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.672
You know what I did last night?

29:27.382 --> 29:32.053
On the absolute insistence of Debra,
and God knows I tried to blow her off.

29:33.263 --> 29:35.306
I read your novel last night.

29:36.224 --> 29:37.308
You did?

29:38.435 --> 29:42.021
Have you shown this to anyone else,
anyone outside the agency?

29:42.189 --> 29:44.148
No, no, you're the only one
that's seen it.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.484
I mean, outside of my wife.

29:47.653 --> 29:48.861
What does she think?

29:49.112 --> 29:51.405
She was the one that insisted
I show it to you.

29:51.573 --> 29:54.617
Well, I can't wait to meet her
and thank her.

29:55.952 --> 30:00.915
Rory, I would very much like
to represent you...

30:01.083 --> 30:02.291
and your work.

30:03.835 --> 30:05.503
You've written...

30:05.796 --> 30:09.173
a remarkable work of fiction.

30:14.221 --> 30:16.389
"There was no epiphany."

30:16.890 --> 30:19.934
No sign from the gods
to point him in the right direction...

30:20.102 --> 30:23.896
like there had been in all the books
that he had loved growing up.

30:25.899 --> 30:29.568
All he had to do
was sign the contract.

30:31.446 --> 30:34.699
"The book was a unanimous critical
and commercial success."

30:39.913 --> 30:42.373
Thank you. Hi.

30:43.125 --> 30:46.919
"He was the darling
of the New York literary world."

30:47.087 --> 30:51.340
The winner of this year's American
Fellowship of Arts and Letters Award...

30:51.508 --> 30:53.467
Mr. Rory Jansen.

30:57.055 --> 31:00.808
Let's raise a glass here
to our son, the writer.

31:00.976 --> 31:02.977
- To Rory.
- To Rory.

31:03.186 --> 31:07.022
"Rory Jansen had made his choice."

31:23.248 --> 31:26.167
"And then he met the old man."

31:27.794 --> 31:31.130
That's the end of part one.

31:32.883 --> 31:34.633
Thank you.

31:36.511 --> 31:37.887
Thank you for coming.

31:38.054 --> 31:41.140
Come along, people.
Give the man some breathing room.

31:41.308 --> 31:42.600
It's his break, after all.

31:43.268 --> 31:44.977
Thank you.

31:46.980 --> 31:49.231
If you want to lie down
or relax for a while...

31:49.399 --> 31:50.775
you know where the room is.

31:50.942 --> 31:53.527
I read that you liked the 2005 Rosé.

31:59.367 --> 32:03.204
Don't forget, Clayton, 30 minutes,
so no time for foreplay.

32:04.831 --> 32:07.750
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay, I've read his books.

32:09.503 --> 32:11.337
So, what'd you say
your name was again?

32:11.505 --> 32:13.464
I didn't. It's Daniella.

32:15.801 --> 32:16.967
That's a beautiful name.

32:17.552 --> 32:19.678
Can't you think
of something better than that?

32:21.306 --> 32:23.390
Well, how about this:

32:23.558 --> 32:25.643
They gave me a little green room
back there.

32:25.811 --> 32:29.563
It's got really great wine and cheese. And
I won't have to sign any more books...

32:29.731 --> 32:33.442
and maybe I'll think of something
more interesting to say.

32:33.610 --> 32:34.652
Wanna go?

32:34.820 --> 32:36.153
- Lead the way.
- Come on.

32:37.739 --> 32:40.324
- Shut up.
- I have to rest my voice.

32:40.492 --> 32:44.203
It gets really dry when I read,
and I have a whole other section.

32:44.371 --> 32:45.955
- Don't bullshit me.
- I'm not.

32:46.122 --> 32:48.624
It's okay. I already know
everything about you anyway.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.751
Oh, really? Everything?

32:50.919 --> 32:52.753
Everything.

32:53.380 --> 32:54.547
What do you know?

32:55.131 --> 32:57.383
I know you hate tomatoes.

32:58.301 --> 33:00.302
I know...

33:00.595 --> 33:04.682
Miles Davis' Kind of Blue
is your favorite jazz recording.

33:05.392 --> 33:08.561
I know you love to watch
Cheers reruns.

33:08.728 --> 33:11.021
And I know you took Latin
for seven years...

33:11.189 --> 33:15.651
- and cheated on every single test.
- Wait a minute. How do you know that?

33:16.152 --> 33:18.028
Esquire, you said it yourself.

33:18.196 --> 33:21.198
I've got to start reading
my interviews.

33:21.366 --> 33:22.741
So...

33:24.411 --> 33:26.495
what else do you know?

33:27.831 --> 33:31.625
I know that you've been with your wife
since your freshman year of college.

33:33.044 --> 33:36.755
I know that you go to every single
Yankees home game...

33:36.923 --> 33:41.176
and I know that you,
Clayton Hammond, are a genius.

33:41.344 --> 33:43.220
- Shows how much you know.
- Why's that?

33:43.388 --> 33:45.306
I missed two Yankee games last year.

33:45.473 --> 33:47.391
Oh, sorry.

33:48.685 --> 33:52.354
And my wife and I are...

33:54.232 --> 33:55.774
separated.

33:55.942 --> 33:59.945
I actually did know that,
but you're wearing a ring.

34:01.448 --> 34:02.948
Yeah.

34:06.828 --> 34:08.786
So, Daniella...

34:08.955 --> 34:11.916
how did you get backstage tonight?

34:12.458 --> 34:16.462
I'm a grad student at Columbia, and I
begged my professor for his ticket.

34:17.047 --> 34:19.924
I won the Elman Fellowship,
just like you.

34:20.425 --> 34:22.217
Mr. Hammond, they're ready for you.

34:22.385 --> 34:25.429
Yes, Mr. Hammond,
we're ready for you.

34:30.643 --> 34:34.855
This is the second and final selection
of the evening.

34:36.024 --> 34:38.692
“It was a crisp
and clear autumn morning.

34:38.860 --> 34:43.237
"The old man was dressed
exactly as the day before."

34:46.993 --> 34:49.578
- Can I hail you a cab?
- I'm gonna take the bus, thanks.

34:49.746 --> 34:51.455
You're welcome.

35:00.548 --> 35:03.175
Go to Central Park? Great.

36:00.358 --> 36:02.526
How you doing today?

36:02.902 --> 36:05.362
I'm okay. How are you?

36:07.615 --> 36:10.200
- You know what I mean?
- Sure.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.416
What's that book you're reading?

36:19.461 --> 36:21.837
Ask the Dust, John Fante.

36:22.005 --> 36:25.049
Oh, how did you find him?
Nobody knows him.

36:25.216 --> 36:26.425
You read Fante?

36:26.593 --> 36:28.635
Read him? I knew him.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.346
You knew John Fante.

36:31.514 --> 36:34.641
Met him in Los Angeles.

36:34.934 --> 36:37.394
Must have been 1958.

36:37.562 --> 36:39.813
He should have been someone
that everybody knows.

36:39.981 --> 36:41.065
Yeah.

36:41.232 --> 36:42.399
What happened?

36:43.568 --> 36:45.235
Life.

36:52.118 --> 36:56.246
So how does it feel?

36:57.040 --> 36:58.832
How does what feel?

36:59.000 --> 37:03.504
To be somebody everybody knows?

37:03.963 --> 37:05.881
You know,
I don't really think about it.

37:06.049 --> 37:08.175
Oh, come on.

37:08.343 --> 37:11.220
Don't bullshit an old bullshitter.

37:12.180 --> 37:13.889
It feels good, right?

37:15.767 --> 37:18.644
Feels good to have your work
recognized, yeah.

37:18.812 --> 37:21.772
Yeah, I'm sure it does, yeah.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.525
Bet you get good tables
in restaurants now.

37:24.901 --> 37:26.443
I do.

37:28.113 --> 37:30.030
Life was kind to you.

37:33.201 --> 37:34.660
Gods smiled when you were born.

37:34.828 --> 37:40.082
They looked down and they said,
"Look there, that one is a writer.

37:40.250 --> 37:43.252
His words will be celebrated."

37:43.419 --> 37:45.921
I don't know if it's that grandiose.
I just got lucky.

37:46.089 --> 37:48.132
I wrote a book,
people happened to like it.

37:48.299 --> 37:51.009
I mean,
I don't know how things happen.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.262
I mean, I wrote two books...

37:53.429 --> 37:56.515
that wouldn't have gotten published
if that one never did.

37:56.683 --> 37:59.601
Well, I'll bet they'll publish them now.

38:03.898 --> 38:05.858
I read your book.

38:07.235 --> 38:10.487
I liked it very, very much.

38:10.655 --> 38:12.114
Thank you. I appreciate that.

38:12.282 --> 38:14.992
And now forgive an old fan
for a moment.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.327
Just indulge me.

38:19.164 --> 38:20.664
You wrote about Paris...

38:20.832 --> 38:22.958
right after the war.

38:23.126 --> 38:26.920
And when I read your stories,
I was right there.

38:27.255 --> 38:31.717
I tasted that wine,
the sweetness of that wine.

38:31.885 --> 38:33.594
I...

38:34.888 --> 38:37.222
made love to the girl.

38:38.224 --> 38:40.309
I sat in the cafe that morning...

38:40.476 --> 38:42.352
wondering...

38:42.520 --> 38:45.230
what the future held for me.

38:45.398 --> 38:49.318
Or if it held anything at all for me.

38:51.487 --> 38:53.322
I heard...

38:54.199 --> 38:57.075
that child cry in the night.

38:58.703 --> 39:01.788
And I felt the longing...

39:01.956 --> 39:04.875
for my home so far away.

39:08.421 --> 39:11.506
You are some writer, my friend.

39:12.926 --> 39:14.676
Thank you.

39:16.638 --> 39:19.598
Wow, thank you.
I really do appreciate that.

39:20.558 --> 39:22.434
I have to go. My wife...

39:22.602 --> 39:24.102
I know, I know.

39:24.270 --> 39:26.980
Artists always feel uncomfortable
talking about their work.

39:27.148 --> 39:29.483
- No, no, no.
- I wonder if there's just one thing...

39:29.651 --> 39:31.485
- you'd do for me.
- Sure.

39:31.653 --> 39:35.197
I wondered if you'd autograph...

39:35.365 --> 39:37.157
- my copy of your book.
- Of course.

39:38.034 --> 39:39.826
Do you have a pen?

39:43.748 --> 39:46.166
A writer without a pen.

39:46.334 --> 39:47.668
Well...

39:47.835 --> 39:49.628
Well, today's a reading day.

39:49.796 --> 39:51.046
Oh, yes.

39:51.214 --> 39:53.423
Well, I have a pen.

39:53.591 --> 39:55.300
So...

39:55.468 --> 39:57.135
I do have a story.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.096
A very good story.

39:59.264 --> 40:03.433
Now, I know you get this line all the
time, but I think you'll like the story.

40:04.143 --> 40:08.397
If I was to tell you the story
and you wrote it...

40:08.564 --> 40:10.399
well, then, maybe...

40:10.566 --> 40:12.276
you could give me a little credit?

40:14.612 --> 40:16.905
Well, that wouldn't be fair, would it?

40:17.657 --> 40:19.283
Have a good day.

40:19.867 --> 40:22.577
It's about a man who wrote a book
and then lost it...

40:22.745 --> 40:25.706
and the pissant kid who found it.

40:30.878 --> 40:32.713
You still here?

40:41.723 --> 40:44.141
Do you want to hear my story?

40:46.311 --> 40:48.186
Or don't you have the time?

41:00.575 --> 41:02.200
So...

41:03.661 --> 41:08.248
it's 1944,
and there's this 18-year-old kid...

41:08.416 --> 41:12.377
a soldier in the army,
never saw any action.

41:12.545 --> 41:16.840
He was sent to Paris
right at the end of the war.

41:19.802 --> 41:21.595
There he is...

41:21.763 --> 41:25.974
a dumb kid
with a dumb-ass grin on his face.

41:26.768 --> 41:29.436
There he is in Paris.

41:29.604 --> 41:33.899
To him, it might as well have been
the other side of the goddamned world.

41:36.319 --> 41:42.032
It was a joke that his unit was
constantly drawing the worst details.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.659
Most of the time,
they were relaying sewage pipes...

41:44.827 --> 41:47.621
blown apart by the Germans
during the occupation.

41:47.789 --> 41:49.456
It was god-awful work.

41:49.624 --> 41:51.583
Street smell.

41:51.793 --> 41:53.752
I miss Utah.

41:56.464 --> 41:59.091
Somehow the kid was happy...

41:59.258 --> 42:00.967
like a pig in shit.

42:03.888 --> 42:06.556
The guys in his unit,
most of them were different...

42:06.724 --> 42:09.643
from anybody he'd known
in his neighborhood.

42:09.811 --> 42:14.481
They were from all over,
little towns he'd never even heard of.

42:21.948 --> 42:23.407
Poor kid probably hit a mine.

42:23.574 --> 42:25.867
Let's get the body to the morgue.

42:32.708 --> 42:37.796
That was the only dead body
he saw his whole time in the Army.

42:39.799 --> 42:42.926
There was this one guy in his unit
real different to him...

42:43.094 --> 42:45.971
an intellectual, real bookworm...

42:46.139 --> 42:50.267
and over time,
he became the boy's best friend.

42:52.019 --> 42:54.688
He lent him some books to read...

42:54.856 --> 42:58.900
the first books
the kid had ever read about anything.

43:02.155 --> 43:03.989
For the first time...

43:04.157 --> 43:09.411
he saw a world that was bigger
than the one he'd been born into.

43:11.080 --> 43:14.040
And he wanted more.

43:17.420 --> 43:19.713
He wanted to be something more.

43:19.881 --> 43:22.132
- A writer.
- Yeah...

43:22.300 --> 43:25.802
but he had no idea
what the word really meant.

43:25.970 --> 43:29.514
Certainly didn't have a clue
about how to go about it.

43:31.893 --> 43:33.602
You grew up in Philadelphia?

43:33.769 --> 43:35.604
Grew up in Philly but born in London.

43:35.771 --> 43:37.230
London?

43:48.659 --> 43:50.285
What did she just say?

43:50.703 --> 43:53.205
- What did she say?
- My French is a little weak...

43:53.372 --> 43:55.665
but I'm pretty sure
she said she loves you.

44:02.423 --> 44:04.257
- Go talk to her.
- No.

44:04.425 --> 44:06.009
- Go.
- That's not funny.

44:06.177 --> 44:07.302
Go talk to her.

44:07.470 --> 44:09.137
Come on, if you don't, I will.

44:12.183 --> 44:15.185
He found out some time later
that what she'd actually said was:

44:15.353 --> 44:17.646
"Pay your check
and get the hell out of here."

44:18.064 --> 44:20.941
But who was he to question fate?

44:22.985 --> 44:26.112
He'd picked up one word of French.

44:27.782 --> 44:30.534
And she knew one word of English.

44:30.701 --> 44:32.327
Yes.

44:35.164 --> 44:38.250
It was the perfect relationship.

44:44.173 --> 44:45.715
What is ice cream?

44:53.432 --> 44:55.183
What?

44:55.351 --> 44:57.352
- What?
- It's cold in my head.

44:57.520 --> 44:59.563
- Cold in your head?
- Yeah, pain.

44:59.730 --> 45:02.691
Go like this.
Take your finger like this.

45:02.858 --> 45:06.069
Under your tongue. It's a little trick.
It'll make it go away, okay?

45:08.281 --> 45:11.366
- It doesn't wanna go.
- Give it a second, okay?

45:12.827 --> 45:14.244
Now?

45:14.996 --> 45:16.246
It's gone.

45:16.414 --> 45:17.664
Told you.

45:18.207 --> 45:19.457
Okay, one more.

45:35.683 --> 45:37.225
What happened?

45:38.185 --> 45:40.854
He got discharged from the Army.

46:15.348 --> 46:19.100
But what once was his whole world
suddenly seemed...

46:19.769 --> 46:21.436
small.

46:22.647 --> 46:25.273
Nothing had changed
since he'd been away.

46:28.110 --> 46:29.986
Except him.

46:31.155 --> 46:32.197
He had changed.

46:35.409 --> 46:37.118
For the first time in his life...

46:37.828 --> 46:39.704
he tried to write.

46:41.749 --> 46:43.083
Tried to write about Paris...

46:43.250 --> 46:45.460
about what he'd seen...

46:45.628 --> 46:47.837
and how he'd felt.

46:48.881 --> 46:51.925
But the words just wouldn't come.

47:04.188 --> 47:07.065
He knew the life he wanted.

47:08.567 --> 47:11.569
He knew what he had to do to get it.

47:40.433 --> 47:44.436
The young man began
his apprenticeship as a writer.

47:45.396 --> 47:49.899
He got a job as a journalist
for a small English-language weekly.

47:50.484 --> 47:53.903
There were a lot of them
springing up for all the expats...

47:54.071 --> 47:58.366
and they'd hire anyone
who could string a few words together.

47:59.660 --> 48:02.662
It was a good place to learn.

48:42.077 --> 48:45.163
He married Celia two weeks later.

49:05.476 --> 49:10.647
Six pounds and three ounces,
eyes like her mother.

49:13.192 --> 49:16.361
That was his moment...

49:16.779 --> 49:19.614
not that he knew it at the time.

49:24.078 --> 49:26.579
Maybe one never does.

49:46.600 --> 49:51.229
She used to cry so much.

49:51.981 --> 49:56.734
At times, he could barely think,
let alone write.

50:05.286 --> 50:06.703
Sir?

50:09.415 --> 50:10.874
She was sick.

50:12.293 --> 50:13.501
The wife?

50:14.086 --> 50:15.837
My daughter.

50:23.387 --> 50:25.680
There was nothing he could do.

51:12.144 --> 51:14.479
Celia was never the same.

51:16.106 --> 51:18.399
And he wasn't the same either...

51:18.901 --> 51:22.654
even though he tried to pretend.

52:05.406 --> 52:07.281
I'll be back later.

52:33.392 --> 52:34.976
Celia?

52:50.117 --> 52:53.619
She said she'd gone home
to her mother's in the country.

52:55.164 --> 52:57.623
Needed time to think.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.626
She needed to be apart.

56:00.057 --> 56:04.268
He couldn't remember
sleeping or eating.

56:08.482 --> 56:12.193
The words simply
poured out of him.

56:15.989 --> 56:19.033
A stream that he could not control...

56:19.826 --> 56:22.453
nor question
where they came from.

56:22.621 --> 56:26.707
The words became form,
the form became whole...

56:26.875 --> 56:30.920
and after two weeks,
it was finished.

56:48.105 --> 56:49.647
And then?

56:49.815 --> 56:51.607
Then he slept.

56:52.192 --> 56:54.235
Dreamless sleep.

56:54.778 --> 57:00.366
When he woke, he cleaned
the apartment and went to find his wife.

57:03.537 --> 57:06.455
She looked like a child to him...

57:07.082 --> 57:10.334
sitting in the room she grew up in.

57:14.089 --> 57:16.966
She begged him
to go back to Paris without her.

57:17.134 --> 57:19.010
Just go. Go.

58:03.555 --> 58:07.183
A few weeks later,
she finally came home.

58:27.579 --> 58:29.580
He was so grateful to have her home.

58:29.748 --> 58:31.290
Thank you.

58:32.709 --> 58:35.127
He just wanted to hold her...

58:35.462 --> 58:37.588
see her laugh again.

58:40.008 --> 58:43.636
So you read my story?

58:44.888 --> 58:46.347
No, I'm not ready yet.

58:46.515 --> 58:48.724
She said
she wanted to start life over.

58:48.892 --> 58:50.935
Well, that's okay.

58:51.103 --> 58:54.271
Said it like it would be the
easiest thing in the world to do.

58:54.439 --> 58:57.149
It's in the valise here.

59:00.987 --> 59:02.238
No.

59:02.989 --> 59:06.325
I don't understand,
I had it with me on the train.

59:06.493 --> 59:09.620
- What?
- I had it with me on the train.

59:11.123 --> 59:14.166
But it was in a different case?

59:33.603 --> 59:35.855
It shouldn't have meant anything...

59:37.232 --> 59:41.986
but writing that story
had somehow saved him.

59:44.030 --> 59:46.657
How could she not understand?

59:48.952 --> 59:52.955
For years, he'd never forgive himself
for caring about those stupid words.

59:53.165 --> 59:54.790
You know what?

59:55.208 --> 59:58.377
You are not the only one
who lost her.

01:00:22.402 --> 01:00:26.447
She left something.
Listen to me, okay?

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:47.218
For a time,
they tried to patch things up together...

01:00:48.386 --> 01:00:50.888
but you can't erase the past...

01:00:52.265 --> 01:00:55.100
no matter how much you want to.

01:00:59.481 --> 01:01:04.026
And for the first time,
the young man began to long for home.

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:12.076
Soon the longing grew so strong he...

01:01:13.662 --> 01:01:15.246
He left.

01:01:20.126 --> 01:01:22.461
Never went back to Paris...

01:01:25.465 --> 01:01:28.008
never saw Celia again.

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:37.351
But after he lost those pages...

01:01:39.771 --> 01:01:44.525
he was never able to
set down one word...

01:01:46.152 --> 01:01:48.153
that looked right to him.

01:01:51.283 --> 01:01:54.618
Maybe he was afraid
of going that deep again.

01:01:56.830 --> 01:02:00.874
Perhaps he just lost the knack.
Anyway, he stopped trying.

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:05.129
And after a time...

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.551
he found a little town up north,
settled there.

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:15.973
Found a kind of peace.

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:20.311
How's that feel?

01:02:26.151 --> 01:02:27.526
Wait.

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:30.946
It's not over yet.

01:02:32.699 --> 01:02:37.202
This is where it really
gets interesting.

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:44.752
Long after all of this
faded into the past...

01:02:44.919 --> 01:02:49.173
the young man,
who was now an old man...

01:02:49.716 --> 01:02:52.426
wandered into a bookstore.

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:59.475
The blurb said that the author of the story
is a new fresh voice...

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:02.436
who had something new to say.

01:03:03.605 --> 01:03:07.566
I opened the book and began to read.

01:03:08.109 --> 01:03:09.777
Your book.

01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:15.616
And the narrator
was standing over a crib.

01:03:16.868 --> 01:03:19.828
His child was dying...

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:23.415
and there was nothing he could do.

01:03:27.754 --> 01:03:29.171
Look...

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.138
A misunderstanding, I...

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:40.599
No, no, my friend...

01:03:40.767 --> 01:03:44.770
- ..there's no misunderstanding, no.
- I found...

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:49.024
You can't slide out of it now.

01:03:50.944 --> 01:03:54.113
These are my words...

01:03:54.656 --> 01:03:57.116
my stories.

01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:06.333
What the fuck is a window tear
anyway?

01:04:10.338 --> 01:04:13.340
I don't know how you did it.

01:04:15.301 --> 01:04:17.886
To be brutally honest, I don't care.

01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:23.600
I just thought you should know
the story...

01:04:23.768 --> 01:04:27.771
behind these stories
in case anyone was to ask.

01:04:30.942 --> 01:04:35.738
Maybe now
you've got your next book.

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:04.683
"And he sat on that bench,
unaware of the world..."

01:05:04.851 --> 01:05:07.311
or of time passing around him.

01:05:07.979 --> 01:05:11.273
After a few hours,
the sun finally set...

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:14.359
and Rory Jansen slowly rose...

01:05:15.153 --> 01:05:17.780
"...searching for his way home."

01:05:21.367 --> 01:05:23.035
Thank you.

01:05:27.207 --> 01:05:29.333
If you wanna know
the rest of the story...

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:32.503
you'll just have to buy the book.

01:05:34.422 --> 01:05:37.674
Your work, you seem hesitant to draw
any conclusions about our moral behavior.

01:05:37.842 --> 01:05:41.261
- Do you make any statements about that?
- Yes, I am hesitant.

01:05:41.429 --> 01:05:44.515
What I think is great
about art and artists...

01:05:44.682 --> 01:05:47.935
is that we get to
ask the questions...

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.524
even though
we may never know the answers.

01:05:58.196 --> 01:06:00.030
Excuse me a minute.

01:06:09.874 --> 01:06:12.459
Excuse me, Miss...

01:06:12.627 --> 01:06:14.962
may I seem some ID first?

01:06:16.256 --> 01:06:20.342
- You looked like you were drowning.
- No, no. I'm in my element.

01:06:21.469 --> 01:06:22.928
You wanna get out of here?

01:06:23.096 --> 01:06:26.723
Well, I'm supposed to be over there,
mingling, taking pictures...

01:06:26.891 --> 01:06:30.853
and smiling. Raising all that money
in these troubled economic times.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.522
- That's too bad.
- Well, okay, you talked me into it.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:36.358
- Okay, I thought you'd never ask.
- Let's slam these.

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:41.196
I wanna see where you write.

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:43.991
I can assure you,
it's not that exciting.

01:06:44.158 --> 01:06:47.119
Why don't you let me
be the judge of that?

01:06:53.626 --> 01:06:56.128
This place, it's...

01:06:56.296 --> 01:06:59.882
- Empty.
- Empty, yeah.

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:03.385
Somehow it's exactly
the way I imagined it.

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:07.264
Really? So you imagined me living
in a place for eight months...

01:07:07.432 --> 01:07:08.807
and barely unpacking a box?

01:07:10.184 --> 01:07:12.853
It's very elegant, Mr. Hammond.

01:07:13.354 --> 01:07:15.814
- May I take your jacket?
- Yes.

01:07:24.198 --> 01:07:27.159
See, I told you
it's not all that exciting.

01:07:27.327 --> 01:07:28.452
Are you kidding?

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:31.914
I could write my entire dissertation
on your view.

01:07:35.001 --> 01:07:37.753
That was hit by Babe Ruth.

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:41.298
Unfortunately, it was when he was
a goddamn Red Sock...

01:07:41.466 --> 01:07:43.383
but what can you do?

01:07:45.637 --> 01:07:47.804
I've got a bottle
of Bordeaux downstairs...

01:07:47.972 --> 01:07:50.849
that's just been screaming
for an occasion like this.

01:07:51.017 --> 01:07:52.851
You know, that sounds good.

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:55.687
- Come on.
- Can we drink it here?

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.360
- What, at my desk?
- Yeah. Can we?

01:08:03.613 --> 01:08:05.989
We can do anything we want.

01:08:06.532 --> 01:08:07.824
We're grown-ups.

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:10.077
Then get the wine.

01:09:29.490 --> 01:09:32.617
- Your wine.
- Thank you.

01:09:32.785 --> 01:09:35.787
So, what should we drink to?

01:09:35.955 --> 01:09:38.457
Your new book, of course.

01:09:40.167 --> 01:09:42.752
- How about we drink to...?
- Your book.

01:09:46.381 --> 01:09:48.216
Will you tell me something?

01:09:48.968 --> 01:09:50.426
What happens?

01:09:51.636 --> 01:09:54.890
What happens to Rory
after the old man finds him?

01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:58.643
- Will you tell me something?
- If I can.

01:09:59.312 --> 01:10:04.357
Why would such a beautiful, intelligent
girl such as yourself wanna be...

01:10:04.525 --> 01:10:08.028
- something so silly as a writer?
- Silly?

01:10:08.196 --> 01:10:10.197
Don't you know
words ruin everything?

01:10:10.364 --> 01:10:13.283
I don't believe you for a second.
You love words.

01:10:16.662 --> 01:10:21.917
I'm young, spoiled, impetuous
and American. Humor me.

01:10:23.836 --> 01:10:28.048
Please? Pretty, pretty, pretty please?

01:10:30.468 --> 01:10:32.010
Close your eyes.

01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:55.992
And so, like so many of the great
clichés in the history of civilization...

01:10:56.244 --> 01:11:00.539
Rory Jansen decided
the only thing to do was...

01:11:02.375 --> 01:11:04.334
drink on it.

01:11:13.511 --> 01:11:19.182
And so he gets rip-roaring,
death-defyingly drunk...

01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:20.767
and now he's got his nerve.

01:11:21.686 --> 01:11:23.854
And he starts to think.

01:11:24.021 --> 01:11:27.607
He allows himself to think
the whole thing through.

01:11:28.025 --> 01:11:31.486
Maybe for the first time
in his entire life.

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:34.364
And he comes to the conclusion...

01:11:34.532 --> 01:11:37.284
or more appropriately,
this myth...

01:11:37.451 --> 01:11:40.036
that he's heard
so many times before...

01:11:40.204 --> 01:11:44.124
that the truth shall set you free.

01:11:49.964 --> 01:11:52.799
Hey. Guess what,
I spoke to the realtor today...

01:11:52.967 --> 01:11:56.553
and she said that we can move in
as early as the 6th.

01:11:56.721 --> 01:11:58.972
Isn't that awesome?

01:12:02.393 --> 01:12:04.436
We'll need to buy
some carpets and stuff...

01:12:04.604 --> 01:12:05.896
Why do you love me?

01:12:08.816 --> 01:12:10.734
- Dora?
- Are you drunk?

01:12:10.902 --> 01:12:12.986
I need to know why you love me.

01:12:18.326 --> 01:12:19.910
Okay.

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:27.876
I love you because
you have beautiful eyes.

01:12:30.254 --> 01:12:34.090
I love you because
you're serious all the time...

01:12:34.258 --> 01:12:38.011
but deep, deep down,
you're nothing but a goof ball.

01:12:38.512 --> 01:12:40.138
I just love you.

01:12:40.306 --> 01:12:42.390
Rory, what's going on?

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:45.727
You really think
my eyes are beautiful?

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:49.648
I think your eyes are beautiful, yes.

01:12:50.107 --> 01:12:51.983
They're not mine.

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:58.531
- Okay.
- I'm a liar.

01:13:02.536 --> 01:13:04.162
I don't...

01:13:04.872 --> 01:13:06.373
What are you doing right now?

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:09.584
- What's wrong?
- I didn't write the book.

01:13:12.672 --> 01:13:14.297
What do you...?

01:13:14.465 --> 01:13:17.342
The book, I stole it.

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:20.011
I just found it.

01:13:20.179 --> 01:13:23.515
I didn't even change any of it.
I mean, I...

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:28.353
I don't know who I was
stealing it from and...

01:13:28.521 --> 01:13:30.230
But I knew it wasn't mine.

01:13:30.398 --> 01:13:31.982
I'm very confused right now.

01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:35.443
So you didn't...? You...?
You didn't write the book?

01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:41.574
None of it's mine,
not one single word.

01:13:44.203 --> 01:13:46.162
I don't know what's going on.

01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:51.793
It was there and...

01:13:55.548 --> 01:13:58.633
I think I wanted so badly...

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:02.053
for it to have come from me...

01:14:06.142 --> 01:14:10.061
and then the look,
the way you looked at me...

01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:12.897
when you thought it was mine...

01:14:14.859 --> 01:14:20.238
And for a moment I actually
convinced myself that I wrote it.

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:22.657
Do you believe that?

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:25.201
I could never write
anything that good. I know that.

01:14:25.369 --> 01:14:28.872
- Okay, so then...
- You... I mean, you said so yourself...

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.290
I said... I said what?

01:14:31.459 --> 01:14:34.586
- It doesn't matter.
- What? What did I say?

01:14:34.754 --> 01:14:37.172
You should've known.
You did know, right? You knew...

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.841
- What do you mean?
- You knew when you read them...

01:14:40.009 --> 01:14:41.968
- that they weren't my words.
- I knew?

01:14:42.136 --> 01:14:43.470
You know me so well.

01:14:43.637 --> 01:14:45.180
You were doing research on Paris.

01:14:45.348 --> 01:14:47.349
We had just gotten back
from our honeymoon.

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:49.768
Yeah, but you had to have known.

01:14:49.935 --> 01:14:51.519
What do you mean?
I believed you.

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:54.314
- No, you wanted to believe.
- I know, I believed you!

01:14:54.482 --> 01:14:57.108
- You wanted to...
- I believed you!

01:15:10.456 --> 01:15:12.040
Dora?

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:29.432
Don't touch it.

01:15:35.314 --> 01:15:37.357
You lied to me.

01:15:40.861 --> 01:15:42.779
When you...

01:15:42.947 --> 01:15:45.782
When you read those words,
when you copied them...

01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:49.869
did you ever stop
to think about us?

01:15:53.249 --> 01:15:56.042
Did you think about
what this was gonna do to us?

01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:57.669
To you?

01:15:58.712 --> 01:16:00.964
Did I ever cross your mind?

01:16:07.888 --> 01:16:09.514
I can't be here right now.

01:16:10.057 --> 01:16:13.435
I'm sorry, I just can't be here.

01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:32.579
You really fucked up.

01:16:35.249 --> 01:16:38.668
I think we need to think this through.

01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:40.837
What does that mean?

01:16:42.548 --> 01:16:44.924
You got the cover
of the book review this Sunday.

01:16:45.426 --> 01:16:47.802
I didn't get the cover of this,
some old man got it.

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:50.138
The other book of yours,
did you write that?

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:52.474
Of course I wrote that.
But I didn't plan this.

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:54.309
This isn't something that I planned.

01:16:54.477 --> 01:16:57.937
But the only reason why anybody ever
read my stuff is because of this book.

01:16:58.898 --> 01:17:00.899
You don't want this.

01:17:01.358 --> 01:17:04.652
Everything you're saying you want,
you don't want it.

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.530
Just take my name off the book.

01:17:07.698 --> 01:17:10.992
And what do you think
is gonna happen?

01:17:12.203 --> 01:17:14.746
Do you think they're gonna
give you a hall pass?

01:17:14.914 --> 01:17:17.081
The media? The press?
They're gonna crucify you.

01:17:17.249 --> 01:17:20.084
And my ass is out there
on the line with you.

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.381
You wanna pay this man
off your advance...

01:17:25.549 --> 01:17:27.425
that's the right thing to do.

01:17:27.593 --> 01:17:29.761
You wanna cut him
into the movie rights, fine.

01:17:29.929 --> 01:17:32.388
You wanna buy him a house,
a car, a fucking boat?

01:17:32.556 --> 01:17:34.974
But don't screw yourself
for the rest of your life...

01:17:35.142 --> 01:17:37.936
for one stupid mistake.
And don't you fuck me!

01:17:47.446 --> 01:17:50.907
Trust me, this isn't the first time
an author's done something like this.

01:17:51.075 --> 01:17:52.617
Don't do that.

01:17:53.494 --> 01:17:55.078
You may not believe me now...

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.832
but you will thank me later.

01:18:03.754 --> 01:18:06.047
My book, the one you sold...

01:18:10.177 --> 01:18:12.220
is it as good as this book?

01:18:15.349 --> 01:18:17.433
Tell me the truth, Joe.

01:18:20.771 --> 01:18:22.397
Thank you.

01:18:27.695 --> 01:18:30.405
We're supposed to have dinner
with your parents tonight.

01:18:32.032 --> 01:18:33.950
I'm really not up for it.

01:18:34.827 --> 01:18:36.911
Fine, I'll call your mother.

01:18:40.708 --> 01:18:43.960
How much longer
until this is over, Rory?

01:18:44.128 --> 01:18:45.545
What do you want from me?

01:18:46.964 --> 01:18:50.508
Do you think you're the only person
on this earth who's ever made a mistake?

01:18:51.302 --> 01:18:53.469
Are you gonna let this destroy you?

01:18:54.221 --> 01:18:56.014
Destroy us?

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:03.229
What if we had a baby?

01:19:06.525 --> 01:19:10.153
We've always wanted to.
We've always wanted to start a family.

01:19:18.287 --> 01:19:20.204
I think I'm gonna break.

01:19:20.664 --> 01:19:24.167
I'm gonna break in half.
I'm gonna break in half.

01:19:24.335 --> 01:19:28.046
You're not gonna break.
You're not gonna break.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.468
I won't let you.

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:44.604
Can we just try to put this
behind us?

01:19:49.193 --> 01:19:51.819
Look at me. Can we?

01:20:47.751 --> 01:20:49.627
How are you doing today?

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:07.520
- What type of plant is that?
- Plectranthus.

01:21:08.021 --> 01:21:10.148
Swedish ivy.

01:21:11.358 --> 01:21:12.900
It's nice.

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:20.742
You come up here
just to bullshit about plants?

01:21:21.368 --> 01:21:22.910
No, I did not.

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:26.831
Well, if you came to see
if I was gonna blow the whistle on you...

01:21:26.999 --> 01:21:32.837
you should relax and go back home
to your great, big life.

01:21:33.839 --> 01:21:35.465
I wanna fix this.

01:21:37.134 --> 01:21:39.427
There's nothing to fix.

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:46.309
You just go live the life
you made for yourself.

01:21:46.852 --> 01:21:49.937
If you didn't want anything,
why did you come find me and tell me?

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:52.482
It couldn't be just to torture me.

01:21:54.568 --> 01:21:56.944
You don't even know who I am.

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:59.864
You don't know how,
you don't know why.

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:02.325
I just...

01:22:03.368 --> 01:22:06.454
thought you should know,
that's all.

01:22:08.749 --> 01:22:12.126
Do you think you can just steal
part of my life?

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:14.003
Any man's life?

01:22:14.171 --> 01:22:16.422
Take it as your own...

01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:18.508
and expect
there'd be no price to pay?

01:22:18.675 --> 01:22:23.262
No. Don't you understand?
This is why I'm here.

01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:26.265
Put that back in your pocket
or I'll kick the shit out of you.

01:22:26.433 --> 01:22:29.310
This is not a payoff.
This is all I could get out right now...

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:32.188
but it's all yours.
I'm gonna take my name off the book.

01:22:32.356 --> 01:22:34.273
I'm gonna tell everybody the truth.

01:22:34.608 --> 01:22:37.860
Then you're even more of a fool
than I thought you were.

01:22:38.028 --> 01:22:41.656
- What is all this about then?
- What is it about?

01:22:42.699 --> 01:22:45.034
It's about my life.

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:48.621
It's about my wife, about my child.

01:22:48.789 --> 01:22:53.876
It's about the joy and the pain
that gave birth to those words.

01:22:55.546 --> 01:22:59.966
You take those words,
you take the pain.

01:23:05.389 --> 01:23:10.476
Now, why don't you buy
a plant with that money?

01:23:11.103 --> 01:23:13.563
Here, a Plectranthus,
since you love them so much.

01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:17.984
You take your plant and your money
and you get out of here. Get out of here.

01:23:19.236 --> 01:23:20.987
Hey, I wanna make things right.

01:23:21.154 --> 01:23:22.989
You can't just make things right.

01:23:23.156 --> 01:23:24.991
Things are just things.

01:23:25.158 --> 01:23:29.161
You understand? No matter
how you try and martyr yourself.

01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:36.335
I've got work to do.
This place doesn't run itself.

01:23:36.503 --> 01:23:39.005
Sir, sir. Please. Sir.

01:23:40.674 --> 01:23:41.799
Please!

01:23:58.525 --> 01:24:01.193
I did see her one more time.

01:24:02.321 --> 01:24:03.863
You did?

01:24:06.366 --> 01:24:07.700
In New Jersey.

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:11.662
I was on my way to work.

01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:29.490
Over all those years...

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:34.286
I thought about her every day.

01:25:37.582 --> 01:25:41.502
Broken because of what I did to her.

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:45.506
And then all of a sudden,
there she was.

01:25:53.098 --> 01:25:54.974
She seemed happy.

01:25:59.771 --> 01:26:05.151
Well, if I was to tell you that realization
didn't cause me pain, I'd be lying.

01:26:05.819 --> 01:26:08.070
But, in some ways, it helped me.

01:26:08.572 --> 01:26:10.990
Helped me turn a corner.

01:26:13.326 --> 01:26:17.955
Pick up again
without looking back all the time.

01:26:23.336 --> 01:26:27.506
You think I ruined my life
because I never wrote again.

01:26:27.758 --> 01:26:31.969
- Just because I lost a book of stories.
- No, I just...

01:26:32.596 --> 01:26:35.222
God, you had so much more to do.

01:26:35.682 --> 01:26:38.017
I've done enough. Believe me.

01:26:38.185 --> 01:26:42.480
I've done what I can the best that I can.
That's all you can ask of a person.

01:26:42.647 --> 01:26:44.231
No...

01:26:44.816 --> 01:26:50.071
my tragedy was that I loved words
more than I loved the woman...

01:26:50.864 --> 01:26:53.407
who inspired me to write them.

01:26:57.662 --> 01:27:01.707
- You wanna do something for me?
- Anything at all.

01:27:02.501 --> 01:27:05.252
Walk away, don't look back.

01:27:09.758 --> 01:27:12.468
We all make choices in life.

01:27:12.969 --> 01:27:15.554
The hard thing is to live with them.

01:27:18.642 --> 01:27:21.977
And there ain't nobody
can help you with that.

01:27:24.106 --> 01:27:25.689
Go on.

01:27:31.029 --> 01:27:32.279
Sir?

01:27:38.912 --> 01:27:41.038
I do love your book.

01:28:13.572 --> 01:28:15.573
We all make our choices.

01:28:16.533 --> 01:28:19.743
The hard part is living with them.

01:28:31.298 --> 01:28:36.343
Finally, Rory Jansen knew
what he had to do...

01:28:37.262 --> 01:28:39.180
to live with his.

01:28:40.015 --> 01:28:42.349
The Window Tears...

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:44.560
by Rory Jansen.

01:28:56.072 --> 01:28:57.489
And the old man?

01:28:57.657 --> 01:29:01.702
A few weeks
after Rory went to visit him...

01:29:01.912 --> 01:29:03.412
the old man died.

01:29:04.122 --> 01:29:06.874
And the secret died with him.

01:29:11.838 --> 01:29:16.926
Whatever he had to do, whatever he
had to lose, he would seal it off.

01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:25.392
It was as if by locking off the secret
of one man's life forever...

01:29:26.102 --> 01:29:27.144
he had unveiled...

01:29:27.312 --> 01:29:31.899
another much deeper
and darker secret within himself.

01:30:18.154 --> 01:30:21.282
And that's it. The end.

01:30:22.575 --> 01:30:26.787
No moral, no comeuppance,
no incredible gain of knowledge...

01:30:26.997 --> 01:30:31.709
other than the belief that one can,
after making a terrible mistake in life...

01:30:31.876 --> 01:30:36.380
continue to live
and perhaps even live well.

01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:42.219
Everyone has to sleep at night.

01:30:45.181 --> 01:30:48.267
What really happened, Clay,
after he tells himself all that?

01:30:49.102 --> 01:30:51.687
- I just told you.
- No, tell me the truth.

01:30:52.856 --> 01:30:57.151
He goes on. He lives,
he writes, as well as he can...

01:30:57.319 --> 01:31:00.404
- he's a big success.
- Bullshit.

01:31:00.697 --> 01:31:04.033
I'm not talking about the book.
You're just avoiding. Tell me the truth.

01:31:04.242 --> 01:31:05.909
What are you afraid of, Clay?

01:31:06.244 --> 01:31:07.870
Look, why don't you tell me?

01:31:08.455 --> 01:31:10.998
- What?
- I wanna know what you think.

01:31:11.166 --> 01:31:14.043
You're so smart, you got yourself in here,
you got me talking.

01:31:15.587 --> 01:31:18.172
Acting so precocious,
throwing your little ass around...

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:20.632
quoting Shakespeare,
batting your eyelashes.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.135
Why don't you tell me?
I wanna know what you think.

01:31:23.303 --> 01:31:25.679
What happens to them?

01:31:28.475 --> 01:31:31.060
- I...
- I...? No, no, no.

01:31:31.227 --> 01:31:36.482
You tell me what happens to Rory
and Dora or you can get the hell out.

01:31:52.665 --> 01:31:54.583
He's fucked.

01:32:07.931 --> 01:32:09.598
Now go on.

01:32:10.934 --> 01:32:15.396
Maybe he can forget,
maybe he can write, create...

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:18.399
but it doesn't matter
because he'll never, ever believe it.

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:21.693
He's robbed himself
of the chance to find out.

01:32:21.861 --> 01:32:23.028
Not bad.

01:32:23.196 --> 01:32:26.407
Or maybe he can't write, although
he's been able to fool a few people.

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:28.367
Even better.

01:32:28.535 --> 01:32:30.786
Maybe his marriage falls apart
because for him...

01:32:30.954 --> 01:32:34.289
and his wife to look at one another
is for them to look at the truth.

01:32:34.457 --> 01:32:35.916
Maybe when he goes in public...

01:32:36.084 --> 01:32:39.044
he can wear that mask of confidence
and sophistication...

01:32:39.212 --> 01:32:42.214
but back when he's alone
late at night, he can't sleep...

01:32:42.382 --> 01:32:47.136
because when he closes his eyes
he still sees the face of that old man.

01:32:53.852 --> 01:32:55.436
Maybe...

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:58.063
he sees his own face...

01:32:58.398 --> 01:33:01.608
and the old man
is just a story he made up.

01:33:04.696 --> 01:33:08.699
Or maybe he finds himself in his beautiful
New York apartment...

01:33:08.867 --> 01:33:12.786
overlooking the park, with a girl
who's much too young for him...

01:33:12.954 --> 01:33:17.166
and he's telling her what he knows
to be are tired old stories.

01:33:17.333 --> 01:33:23.255
Because for some reason she believes
that he has something to give her.

01:33:31.055 --> 01:33:33.682
You're very talented, Daniella.

01:33:35.435 --> 01:33:41.023
But at some point, you have to choose
between life and fiction.

01:33:41.524 --> 01:33:45.611
The two are very close,
but they never actually touch.

01:33:45.778 --> 01:33:49.448
They're two very,
very different things.

01:34:11.638 --> 01:34:12.679
What?

01:34:13.181 --> 01:34:14.681
What's wrong?

01:34:28.238 --> 01:34:31.990
- You don't want me?
- No, no, no.

01:34:32.158 --> 01:34:34.660
Look, it's not like you're corrupting
anything here.

01:34:34.827 --> 01:34:37.704
I want this. I want you.

01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:41.708
I...

01:34:47.674 --> 01:34:49.258
You should leave.

01:34:56.766 --> 01:35:00.727
Is that what you really want, Clay?

01:35:05.233 --> 01:35:07.317
What do you really want?

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.464
I'm sorry.
