WEBVTT

00:01.248 --> 00:03.239
But you know what
I'd really like to do?

00:03.317 --> 00:05.683
No, but I got a feeling
you're gonna tell me.

00:07.754 --> 00:10.552
- Get ready for him.
- How are we gonna get past them?

00:10.624 --> 00:13.024
May I suggest we continue
down the road?

00:13.093 --> 00:15.186
Michael!

00:15.262 --> 00:17.992
I really believe that Maggie's life
may be in danger.

00:19.066 --> 00:22.729
It talks. Is there anything
this car cannot do?

00:22.803 --> 00:26.204
- Can we take a direct hit?
I prefer not to find out.

00:26.273 --> 00:28.901
Here. Take over, buddy.
You're on your own.

00:42.989 --> 00:48.154
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:48.228 --> 00:50.219
who does not exist.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.231
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.309 --> 01:04.834
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.911 --> 01:07.937
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:08.014 --> 01:11.575
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:26.793 --> 02:28.988
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yes.

02:29.062 --> 02:33.055
That's good. I see.
Now, what about the weldings?

02:33.133 --> 02:35.897
They all exceed
the state safety regulations.

02:35.969 --> 02:38.699
Okay. Then everything
looks okay to me.

02:38.772 --> 02:41.002
Keep up the good work, Charlie.
You too, Senator.

02:44.444 --> 02:47.880
My committee will be very happy
with the results of my inspection.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.378
Are you all right, Devon?
You don't look so good.

02:58.592 --> 03:01.060
Maggie, isn't there
somewhere we could go...

03:01.127 --> 03:04.290
a little more conducive
to quiet conversation?

03:04.364 --> 03:06.355
I'm sorry, Devon.
I don't have time...

03:06.433 --> 03:09.425
for one of your famous
five-course lunches.

03:10.704 --> 03:12.729
If you want to talk, let's talk.

03:12.806 --> 03:15.570
If not, write a memo.

03:22.549 --> 03:24.540
Thank you.

03:25.619 --> 03:28.349
Hi, fellas. Hi, Maggie! How are ya'?

03:28.421 --> 03:30.355
Hi, Maggie.

03:30.423 --> 03:33.290
Hey, Maggie, when you gonna get
out of politics and get an honest job?

03:33.360 --> 03:35.920
I'll tell you when... Just as
soon as you lose that beer belly.

03:35.996 --> 03:38.226
I'll take that.

03:38.298 --> 03:40.926
Hey, that's not bad.

03:41.001 --> 03:43.026
Hey, Senator.

03:43.103 --> 03:46.436
I meant to ask you up top, what's
gonna go on with that power bill?

03:46.506 --> 03:50.101
If it passes, you guys are
gonna get ripped off again.

03:50.176 --> 03:55.671
- What are you talkin' about? - I'm talking about
a bill that was designed to destroy the environment,

03:55.749 --> 04:00.118
cheat the people and line the pockets
of the private power companies.

04:00.186 --> 04:02.677
Well, so what are you
doing about it?

04:02.756 --> 04:04.849
Well, I'm trying like hell
to defeat it.

04:04.925 --> 04:08.417
All right. Maggie Flynn
speaks for the people.

04:08.495 --> 04:12.158
Okay, okay. But remember,
somebody's gotta do it.

04:12.232 --> 04:14.359
Yeah. Right. Oh, and
thanks for the sandwich.

04:14.434 --> 04:16.368
Big spender.

04:16.435 --> 04:19.632
Maggie, don't you think
it's rather unwise...

04:19.706 --> 04:21.697
for you to be visiting
a construction site?

04:21.774 --> 04:25.404
It's very dangerous, you know.
I'm not visiting. I'm inspecting.

04:25.478 --> 04:27.469
And since when
do I need a bodyguard?

04:27.547 --> 04:29.981
Perhaps since you've been receiving
threatening phone calls at home,

04:30.050 --> 04:32.985
had your office broken into,
found bugs in your telephones.

04:33.053 --> 04:35.817
My, aren't you well informed.

04:35.889 --> 04:38.414
Maggie, my feeling is that these
incidents may have something to do...

04:38.491 --> 04:41.051
with a bill
you're currently opposing.

04:41.127 --> 04:44.028
Devon, I'm currently opposing
a lot of bills.

04:44.097 --> 04:47.294
You'll have to be more specific.

04:47.367 --> 04:50.393
All I'm asking is that you allow me
to provide some protection.

04:50.470 --> 04:53.667
Not a chance. Maggie,
won't you listen to reason?

04:53.740 --> 04:56.607
Devon, you're a very good friend.

04:56.676 --> 05:01.306
I appreciate your concern, but I'm
perfectly capable of taking care of myself.

05:07.654 --> 05:11.351
Is that so?

05:24.571 --> 05:27.005
Hi, Bonnie.
What are you doing now?

05:27.073 --> 05:30.668
I'm about to make a very delicate
adjustment to KITT's laser ducts.

05:30.744 --> 05:33.872
Bonnie, with those hands,
you should've been a surgeon.

05:33.947 --> 05:36.472
That's what my dad always said.

05:36.549 --> 05:38.608
I had to practically
slash my wrists to convince him...

05:38.685 --> 05:40.676
I couldn't stand
the sight of blood.

05:40.754 --> 05:43.416
Medicine's loss.
Our gain.

05:44.891 --> 05:46.882
There. How does that feel?

05:46.960 --> 05:49.986
Perfect. I don't know
what I'd do without you, Bonnie.

05:50.063 --> 05:52.258
You'd break down.
That's what you'd do, buddy.

05:52.332 --> 05:54.823
That's for sure,
the way you abuse him.

05:54.901 --> 05:58.337
- Hello, you two.
- Hi, Devon.

05:58.405 --> 06:01.897
- Bonnie, is KITT fully prepared?
- Yes, sir.

06:05.478 --> 06:08.504
Prepared for what? For your
next assignment, of course.

06:08.581 --> 06:11.106
My next assignment? Wait a
minute here. I got a date tonight.

06:11.184 --> 06:13.550
Oh, that's already
been taken care of.

06:13.620 --> 06:16.714
What do you mean it's been
taken care of? That poor girl.

06:16.790 --> 06:20.692
Um, Sabrina?
She was quite heartbroken.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.752
But I assured her that you
always honor your rain checks.

06:23.830 --> 06:26.958
We have to have a little talk about
this here. Yes, indeed we must.

06:27.033 --> 06:30.935
But there's precious little time.
What do you know about Maggie Flynn?

06:31.004 --> 06:33.370
Maggie Flynn... a state senator,
highly controversial.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.898
Steps on a lot of toes, got the best
voting record in the state legislature.

06:36.976 --> 06:39.706
- Hmm. Not bad.
- Thank you very much.

06:39.779 --> 06:42.873
- She's also a friend of yours, isn't she?
- That's correct.

06:42.949 --> 06:45.383
She's also a member of the Foundation's
board of trustees.

06:45.452 --> 06:49.183
Aha! I thought the Foundation
didn't get involved in politics.

06:49.255 --> 06:53.624
- Oh, as a rule, it doesn't.
- But we're gonna bend that rule a little bit, right?

06:53.693 --> 06:56.059
Well, that'd be nothing new
to you, would it?

06:56.129 --> 06:59.895
No. No, Devon, it wouldn't.
So, what do you want me to do?

06:59.966 --> 07:02.730
Well, this assignment
is perfectly simple.

07:02.802 --> 07:05.362
I have reason to believe that
Maggie's life may be in danger.

07:05.438 --> 07:08.965
Until further notice, I would like you
to be her constant companion.

07:10.043 --> 07:12.102
- All right, you got it.
- Good.

07:12.178 --> 07:14.237
She's expecting you
at her office.

07:16.049 --> 07:18.984
Oh, by the way,
if you have any further questions,

07:19.052 --> 07:21.043
feel free to ask KITT.

07:22.288 --> 07:26.281
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I, uh,
have a few further questions.

07:27.660 --> 07:31.721
Who gave Devon Sabrina's number?

08:30.190 --> 08:34.183
Oh, no.
Any suggestions?

08:34.260 --> 08:36.159
Back up.
There's a space behind you.

08:45.205 --> 08:48.174
This is ridiculous.

08:54.380 --> 08:57.508
I don't care.
This is where we park.

08:58.985 --> 09:01.010
Okay, KITT, you're on your own.

09:01.087 --> 09:04.056
Now try not to look
too conspicuous, okay?

09:36.322 --> 09:40.520
Lester, it's Ben. Yeah,
can you send a tow truck?

09:40.593 --> 09:43.960
Yeah, we've got an illegally
parked car down here.

09:45.665 --> 09:48.259
Uh, Lester, forget it.

10:02.215 --> 10:06.982
Look, I need those environmental impact
reports no later than this afternoon, Roger.

10:07.053 --> 10:09.681
This is important.

10:09.756 --> 10:12.418
Listen to me, Roger. I don't have
time to listen to your troubles.

10:12.492 --> 10:17.327
I have enough of my own, all right? Now,
the point is, is that Maggie needs your help.

10:17.397 --> 10:20.992
Right. Tomorrow. Well,
talk to you later. Bye-bye.

10:22.135 --> 10:26.697
And what can I do for you?
Hi. I'm here to see Maggie Flynn.

10:26.773 --> 10:29.640
For starters, who are you?
Michael Knight.

10:29.709 --> 10:32.735
- Oh, of course. You're from
the Foundation, right? - Right.

10:34.580 --> 10:37.242
- Is she in?
- No, but she's due back at any moment.

10:37.317 --> 10:40.150
Would you mind shutting the door?
Thank you very much.

10:44.757 --> 10:48.523
I don't understand you, Maggie. Your opposition to
my bill is a complete waste of your time and mine.

10:48.594 --> 10:51.028
Oh, really? And what about
the taxpayers' dollars?

10:51.097 --> 10:53.497
That's the waste
I'm worried about.

10:53.566 --> 10:55.796
The state needs
that power plant.

10:55.868 --> 10:58.336
Oh, come off it, Forbes.

10:58.404 --> 11:00.895
The only reason
you're pushing that bill...

11:00.974 --> 11:04.967
is because the company that wants
to build that worthless plant...

11:05.044 --> 11:09.208
just happens to be the chief source
of your campaign funds.

11:09.282 --> 11:11.580
I wish you'd reconsider
your position, Maggie.

11:11.651 --> 11:15.747
- I don't wanna fight you on the senate floor.
- Oh, I'll just bet you don't.

11:15.822 --> 11:18.017
Well, you're in for one
whether you like it or not.

11:18.091 --> 11:22.721
The people of this state will not be
swindled out of their natural resources,

11:22.795 --> 11:25.764
not if I can help it.

11:25.832 --> 11:27.925
Oh, yes. Good day, Senator.

11:30.603 --> 11:32.594
Hello, Senator.

11:32.672 --> 11:34.663
Who are you?
Michael Knight.

11:34.741 --> 11:39.269
- Devon Miles asked me to...
- I know, I know. I was hoping he'd forget about me.

11:39.345 --> 11:42.178
On the contrary, I'd say he's very
concerned about your well-being.

11:42.248 --> 11:45.979
Well, of course he is. Devon's
more of an old lady than I am.

11:46.052 --> 11:48.350
He's blowing this whole thing
out of proportion.

11:48.421 --> 11:50.412
Well, Senator, I'm here
just in case he isn't.

11:50.490 --> 11:53.254
Oh, yes. And, by the way,
call me Maggie.

11:53.326 --> 11:57.660
Nobody calls me Senator...
Except my enemies.

11:57.730 --> 11:59.721
Here are your messages, Maggie.

11:59.799 --> 12:03.360
Mm. Now, what's the latest head count
on that power bill?

12:03.436 --> 12:06.234
No change.
It's still too close to call.

12:06.305 --> 12:08.500
Uh, what's next
on my agenda?

12:08.574 --> 12:11.099
Okay. You have a TV interview
over at KTSM.

12:11.177 --> 12:14.943
- Oh, can you push it back an hour?
- Sorry. It's live from the studio.

12:15.014 --> 12:18.006
Oh! Can you get me across town
in 20 minutes?

12:18.084 --> 12:22.384
Are blueberries blue?
Now, that's funny.

12:22.455 --> 12:26.357
Come on. Let's go.

12:45.745 --> 12:47.736
Lester, it's Ben.

13:06.933 --> 13:09.766
Okay, where are you parked?

13:09.836 --> 13:11.770
I'm not sure.

13:13.005 --> 13:15.098
Wait, wait, wait.
If you wait here,

13:15.174 --> 13:17.267
I'll try and find it, then come back
and pick you up, okay?

13:17.343 --> 13:19.573
Michael, I'm not a princess.
I'm a politician.

13:19.645 --> 13:22.842
Yeah, well, for a politician,
you are a princess.

13:22.915 --> 13:25.349
From what I've read, you've received
practically every award...

13:25.418 --> 13:27.477
from practically
every civic group in the state.

13:27.553 --> 13:31.080
Those awards are easier come by
than campaign contributions.

13:34.894 --> 13:38.489
KITT, where are ya?
I'll be right there, Michael.

13:45.938 --> 13:48.805
Watch out, Maggie!

13:48.875 --> 13:51.969
Hurry up, Maggie. Come on.
Jump on in.

14:11.197 --> 14:13.290
Come on, KITT!
Let's go get 'im!

14:13.366 --> 14:17.462
I can't believe I'm living through this.
What do you call this car?

14:17.537 --> 14:21.530
- It's called KITT.
- Kit? It's a kit car?

14:21.607 --> 14:23.666
No, it's not a kit car.
It's called KITT.

14:23.743 --> 14:25.802
It's called KITT.
I'll remember that.

14:36.422 --> 14:38.583
I can't believe this.

15:03.616 --> 15:06.915
Can't we catch them? I
don't wanna go any faster.

15:06.986 --> 15:08.977
I might hit a pedestrian.

15:19.632 --> 15:21.566
Oh!
You okay?

15:21.634 --> 15:23.568
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I think.

15:31.477 --> 15:33.468
Did you get a good look
at that driver?

15:33.546 --> 15:35.878
No, I didn't,
but maybe KITT did.

15:35.948 --> 15:38.041
What are you doing?

15:38.117 --> 15:40.984
Punching in "Instant Replay."

15:41.053 --> 15:43.851
Wait. Hold it. Hold it right there.
Zoom in on that, will you?

15:45.224 --> 15:48.887
What is it?
License plate..."USA 256."

15:48.961 --> 15:50.952
Can you run a check on that
with the D.M.V?

15:51.030 --> 15:53.328
I've already made the inquiry.

15:53.399 --> 15:55.424
Unfortunately,
the response has been delayed.

15:55.501 --> 15:58.561
You know how difficult it is
to deal with bureaucratic computers.

15:58.638 --> 16:01.402
Well, it-it talks.

16:01.474 --> 16:03.567
Is there anything
this car cannot do?

16:03.643 --> 16:06.942
- Well, it can't cook.
- I wasn't programmed to cook.

16:07.013 --> 16:09.004
Oh, touché.

16:13.686 --> 16:16.018
Maggie, I think I ought to
take you back to the office.

16:16.088 --> 16:20.821
I beg your pardon?
We were on our way to a television studio.

16:20.893 --> 16:24.226
I think you should keep a lower profile
while I'm doin' some investigating.

16:24.297 --> 16:27.596
Oh, really? And what are you going to
discover, that I have powerful enemies?

16:27.667 --> 16:31.433
- We already knew that. - We also know
the guy in the garage is playing for keeps.

16:31.504 --> 16:34.962
I don't care who wants me out of the way.
I am not going to be intimidated.

16:35.041 --> 16:39.034
Maggie, if you stay visible, you're
making yourself a very, very easy target.

16:39.111 --> 16:41.102
Maybe.

16:42.415 --> 16:44.645
But isn't that why
I have a bodyguard?

16:49.488 --> 16:52.651
Devon, I got a problem. Somebody just
tried to kill Maggie again.

16:52.725 --> 16:55.956
Now, I can't investigate her properly
as long as I have to protect her.

16:56.028 --> 16:58.963
Very good point, Michael.

16:59.031 --> 17:01.693
I think I may have an idea
that'll help solve your problem.

17:01.767 --> 17:04.736
Well, whatever the solution is, buddy,
it's gotta be fast.

17:04.804 --> 17:08.035
I assure you. I'll take care of it,
personally.

17:12.377 --> 17:14.868
Well, I'll put it as simply as I can.

17:14.946 --> 17:19.577
The Portage River Power Bill is an attempt
by a handful of greedy profiteers...

17:19.652 --> 17:23.213
to exploit both the people
and the resources of this state.

17:23.289 --> 17:25.257
Now, if this bill
were to become law,

17:25.324 --> 17:29.727
not only would a lush, unspoiled
valley be turned into a desert,

17:29.795 --> 17:34.926
but the people living there would be forced
to buy back both the water and the power...

17:35.000 --> 17:36.991
that rightfully belongs to them
in the first place.

17:37.069 --> 17:39.401
Now, who makes out
on a deal like that?

17:39.472 --> 17:41.633
Not you or me.

17:43.709 --> 17:47.509
That woman is a menace.
Oh, that's putting it mildly.

17:47.580 --> 17:50.640
Has she got the votes to
stop us? I don't think so.

17:51.784 --> 17:56.483
But if she can create enough
public outcry to sway the undecided,

17:56.555 --> 17:58.887
the bill could be in trouble.

17:58.958 --> 18:02.359
Well, then I suggest you get back to
the Capitol and start twisting some arms.

18:02.428 --> 18:06.956
Look, I want a victory, Forbes.
And if you can't assure me that,

18:07.032 --> 18:10.900
then, come election time, I'm gonna
find somebody from your district who can.

18:10.970 --> 18:13.063
I'm doing the best I can.

18:13.139 --> 18:16.438
But you saw for yourself...
Maggie Flynn isn't giving an inch.

18:16.509 --> 18:18.568
Don't you worry about her.

18:18.644 --> 18:20.578
I can handle Maggie Flynn.

18:20.646 --> 18:23.911
Do I still have that awful
television makeup on?

18:23.983 --> 18:27.077
No. You look fine.
Well, what'd you think?

18:27.153 --> 18:29.314
How did I come across?
Like gangbusters.

18:29.388 --> 18:33.085
I wasn't too pushy? Of course you were.
I thought that's all part of your image.

18:33.159 --> 18:37.619
My image? Huh. Listen, with me,
what you see is what you get.

18:37.696 --> 18:40.221
Maggie, I gotta hand it to you.

18:40.299 --> 18:42.392
You are one very gutsy lady.

18:42.468 --> 18:45.437
When you spend your life in political
hand-to-hand combat,

18:45.504 --> 18:47.734
it toughens you up.

18:47.807 --> 18:51.106
What are you doing? I'm taking
KITT out of surveillance mode.

18:51.177 --> 18:53.441
Surveillance mode? Yeah. You
see, he has a sensory device...

18:53.512 --> 18:56.345
that can detect any movement
within a 200-yard radius.

18:56.415 --> 18:58.508
Hmm.
Anything to report, buddy?

18:58.584 --> 19:01.109
All clear, Michael.
It's safe to proceed.

19:06.225 --> 19:10.719
I remember Devon telling me about this special
car they had developed at the Foundation.

19:10.796 --> 19:13.356
I had no idea
it was so sophisticated.

19:13.432 --> 19:17.198
Don't flatter him. He has a tendency
to show off. Not true, Michael.

19:17.269 --> 19:22.036
Flattery implies that I'm capable of
responding to my own unique capabilities.

19:22.107 --> 19:25.941
The truth, Senator,
is that I deal solely in empirical data.

19:26.011 --> 19:28.070
See what I mean?

19:28.147 --> 19:33.278
- Well, in any case, I'm impressed.
- Thank you, Senator. The feeling is mutual.

19:33.352 --> 19:36.651
- Thank you.
- All right. Where to now, Senator?

19:36.722 --> 19:40.624
Back to the office. I have a climbing date
with a mountain of paperwork.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.768
Uh, Jane?

19:50.836 --> 19:54.363
Jane? I believe she's out to lunch.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.204
Hello, Devon. What are you doing
here? I'm trying to solve a problem.

19:57.276 --> 20:01.144
What kind of a problem? You're familiar with
the Foundation's international conference...

20:01.213 --> 20:04.114
on democracy in the emerging nations?

20:04.183 --> 20:08.847
Well, of course I'm familiar with it.
I organized it with Professor LeClair.

20:08.921 --> 20:10.855
He should be up
at the Blue Lake retreat right now.

20:10.923 --> 20:14.586
That's my problem. Professor
LeClair has had to cancel.

20:14.660 --> 20:17.288
There's nobody to moderate
the discussion groups.

20:17.363 --> 20:19.831
I fear a fiasco for the Foundation.

20:19.899 --> 20:24.495
Mm-hmm. Devon, is this a setup?
What on earth are you suggesting?

20:24.570 --> 20:27.664
I am suggesting that, in order
to get me out of town,

20:27.740 --> 20:29.731
you would stoop to something
underhanded.

20:29.808 --> 20:33.539
- "Stoop"?
- Like a subtle form of blackmail.

20:33.612 --> 20:36.911
It can't be blackmail if you
care. Well, of course I care.

20:36.982 --> 20:40.110
I have spent six months putting
that conference together.

20:40.185 --> 20:46.124
That suggests a vested interest. I also have
a vested interest in defeating that power bill.

20:46.191 --> 20:50.218
- Maggie, the vote on the bill's not till next week.
- You'll be back long before then.

20:50.296 --> 20:53.561
It'll give me some time
to check out who's harassing you.

20:56.869 --> 21:00.896
Okay, Devon. You win.

21:00.973 --> 21:03.533
Excellent. Come. Come with me.
We have a car waiting.

21:03.609 --> 21:06.100
Hey. Be careful, okay?
Yes, of course.

21:06.178 --> 21:08.669
And you too. Okay. See
you when you get back.

21:39.979 --> 21:42.948
- KITT?
- Yes, Michael.

21:43.015 --> 21:46.542
You turn up anything on that license
plate yet? It just came through.

21:46.619 --> 21:51.522
The car was registered to the Interstate
Auto Rental Company. Oh, a rented car, huh?

21:51.590 --> 21:53.615
Great. That's another dead end.

21:53.692 --> 21:55.751
Will you permit me
to complete my report?

21:55.828 --> 21:59.924
Oh. Sorry. Very sorry. Go
on. I checked their computers.

21:59.999 --> 22:04.129
The name on the credit card used in
the transaction was Brian Owendorf.

22:04.203 --> 22:09.436
- Brian Owendorf? That's impossible.
- Why is that so impossible?

22:09.508 --> 22:12.739
Because it doesn't make any sense.
That's why.

22:12.811 --> 22:15.974
He's one of Maggie's oldest
and most loyal supporters.

22:16.048 --> 22:18.243
Besides, why would
an environmental activist try to kill her?

22:18.317 --> 22:20.808
We've been working together
on ecology issues for years.

22:20.886 --> 22:25.585
Jane, it's not unheard of for supporters
to manifest their support in radical ways.

22:25.658 --> 22:29.651
What's that supposed to mean? Maybe he's staging
this whole thing to win political support.

22:29.728 --> 22:33.664
Nobody would expect a friend of Maggie's
to run her down in a parking lot.

22:33.732 --> 22:36.394
No. They'd point the finger
at the conglomerates behind the power bill.

22:36.468 --> 22:39.801
Maybe that's exactly
what Brian Owendorf hopes will happen.

22:39.872 --> 22:43.603
I don't know, Michael.
How can you be so sure?

22:43.676 --> 22:45.610
Actually, I'm not.

22:45.678 --> 22:50.172
That's why I wanna go talk
to Brian Owendorf. Yeah.

22:55.421 --> 22:59.255
Michael, what are all those lights
on your dashboard?

22:59.324 --> 23:03.590
Oh, that's a little computer gadget
the Foundation installed.

23:04.596 --> 23:07.895
Cuts down on my speeding tickets.
Oh. Clever.

23:14.940 --> 23:18.706
Uh, slow down. It's right over
there... The building across the street.

23:26.819 --> 23:30.016
All right. I want you to stay in the car
just in case things get nasty.

23:30.089 --> 23:32.080
I don't wanna stay in the car
by myself.

23:32.157 --> 23:35.126
It's okay. KITT'll keep
you company. Who's KITT?

23:35.194 --> 23:37.424
The "little computer gadget."
I'm sorry.

23:37.496 --> 23:40.226
You're not the easiest
thing in the world to explain.

23:40.299 --> 23:42.733
Next time you have trouble,
just ask me.

23:42.801 --> 23:46.737
I know exactly who I am.
I'll remember that.

23:46.805 --> 23:48.796
Hang in here.

23:51.677 --> 23:56.546
Jane, according to my information,
you went to Stanford University.

23:56.615 --> 23:59.379
Mm, uh, that's right.

23:59.451 --> 24:02.318
Part of my circuitry was developed there.
Excellent school.

24:04.490 --> 24:07.254
I don't suppose you know anyone
in the Engineering Department?

24:21.540 --> 24:24.008
- Uh, can I help you?
- Oh. Hi there.

24:24.076 --> 24:28.445
Yeah. Well, that depends on whether
or not Brian Owendorf is here or not.

24:28.514 --> 24:32.644
Uh, yes, he's here. Do you have an appointment?
No, but Brian and I are old buddies.

24:32.718 --> 24:35.186
I thought I'd drop by
and say hello. I see.

24:35.254 --> 24:37.586
You know, we marched together
to save the redwoods.

24:37.656 --> 24:39.715
Wow. Those were the days.

24:39.792 --> 24:43.023
Yeah. Why don't you have a seat.

24:43.095 --> 24:45.029
Okay. Thanks.

24:50.536 --> 24:54.438
What is it, Katie? There's a man out
there. Says he's an old friend of yours.

25:07.252 --> 25:09.243
Do you know him?

25:10.856 --> 25:14.189
I've never seen him before in
my life. Well, what should I do?

25:15.694 --> 25:17.719
Just stall him.

25:17.796 --> 25:19.787
All right.
Okay?

25:21.266 --> 25:24.963
He'll be with you in a minute. Can I get you
something to drink? We have lots of juices.

25:25.037 --> 25:27.403
Yeah. I'll take an orange juice.
Thanks.

25:58.904 --> 26:01.099
KITT, a man took off.

26:01.173 --> 26:03.368
He's headed down an alley
behind the building.

26:03.442 --> 26:06.104
- I'm picking him up on the scanner.
- Yeah, go for it!

26:09.748 --> 26:13.514
- KITT! What are you doing? - Employing
my self-propelled guidance system.

26:13.585 --> 26:15.746
You can follow on the screen.

26:17.489 --> 26:19.480
I don't believe this.

26:39.244 --> 26:41.735
Brian!

27:17.349 --> 27:19.817
I give up!

27:21.486 --> 27:24.649
Michael, will you kindly
tell your car to back off.

27:24.723 --> 27:27.658
It's okay, KITT.
Back up.

27:29.194 --> 27:31.185
Jane, can you tell me
what's going on?

27:31.263 --> 27:35.165
It's okay, Brian.
They're with me.

27:35.233 --> 27:37.258
Why'd you take off
like that?

27:37.336 --> 27:39.600
- I thought you were one of the goons.
- What goons?

27:39.671 --> 27:44.699
We've been getting phone calls, telling us if we don't
stop protesting the Forbes bill, we'll all be dead.

27:44.776 --> 27:49.713
- You too?
- Yeah. They broke in and ransacked the office,

27:49.781 --> 27:52.341
destroyed the files...
The whole bit.

27:52.417 --> 27:54.851
When I saw you going through
the filing cabinets,

27:54.920 --> 27:57.855
I got scared.

27:57.923 --> 27:59.857
I'm sorry.
It's all right.

27:59.925 --> 28:04.191
- I'm just glad we established we're on the same side.
- Brian, did they take anything from the office?

28:04.262 --> 28:08.323
Not much.
A few bucks from petty cash.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.493
Just to make it look
like a burglary, I suppose.

28:10.569 --> 28:12.628
That's all they took?

28:12.704 --> 28:17.198
Oh, yeah. My credit cards.
They got those too.

28:17.275 --> 28:22.076
You know, there's somebody out there
that wants that power bill to pass real bad.

28:32.090 --> 28:35.719
I hope that the conference enables you
to take home a few more new ideas.

28:35.794 --> 28:37.659
I'm certain it will.

28:39.131 --> 28:41.565
Maggie.

28:41.633 --> 28:44.693
It is a delight to see you.

28:44.770 --> 28:47.603
- Miriam.
Professor LeClair.

28:47.672 --> 28:51.233
I was under the impression
you were unable to attend.

28:51.309 --> 28:55.609
- It's a pleasant surprise.
- Oh, for me as well.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.773
And I was under the impression
you wouldn't be here.

28:57.849 --> 29:01.876
Good heavens. Where did you get
such erroneous information?

29:12.831 --> 29:14.856
Hello. Mr. Dixon.

29:14.933 --> 29:17.527
Yeah, everything's under control.

29:17.602 --> 29:19.832
She's up at the retreat,
nice and isolated.

29:19.905 --> 29:23.238
Ah, splendid. What about that
hotshot driver that she had?

29:23.308 --> 29:26.175
You won't have to worry none
about that boy.

29:26.244 --> 29:28.235
I got him
goin' around in circles.

29:28.313 --> 29:32.147
Have you assembled the necessary
support personnel? All set.

29:32.217 --> 29:36.984
Luger, I want you to use
whatever methods are called for.

29:37.055 --> 29:40.047
Now you make sure
that Maggie Flynn stays put.

29:40.125 --> 29:43.561
- I'll handle the rest of the operation.
- You got it.

29:43.628 --> 29:45.562
What are you doing here?

29:45.630 --> 29:48.030
Thought you might like
some breakfast.

29:48.100 --> 29:50.660
Thank you. That was
very thoughtful of you.

29:50.735 --> 29:53.397
How'd you sleep?
I didn't.

29:53.472 --> 29:55.872
I spent the whole night
worrying about Maggie.

29:55.941 --> 29:57.932
Yeah, well, here you go. This
will make you feel a lot better.

29:58.009 --> 30:00.000
Oh, thank you.

30:03.548 --> 30:07.678
Mmm! That's good. You may act
like a crazy person sometimes,

30:07.752 --> 30:10.186
but you sure know how to make
a cup of coffee.

30:10.255 --> 30:13.520
- I'm taking that as a compliment.
- That's the way it was intended.

30:13.592 --> 30:18.620
Now, tell me, how's a girl like you
get to be a girl like you anyway?

30:21.266 --> 30:24.235
I don't know.
Uh, four years of college,

30:24.302 --> 30:27.396
then grad school,
an internship in Washington...

30:27.472 --> 30:30.873
and then a major stroke of luck...
I met Maggie Flynn.

30:30.942 --> 30:34.810
- You really admire her, don't you?
- Yeah.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.247
I'll tell you... she has more integrity
and plain old guts...

30:38.316 --> 30:41.012
than anybody I've ever known.

30:41.086 --> 30:43.850
- To Maggie.
- You bet.

30:43.922 --> 30:47.722
Mm. Excuse me.

30:52.797 --> 30:56.255
Hello. Yes, this is Jane.

30:56.334 --> 30:59.235
Hold on, hold on.
Just take it slow.

31:00.272 --> 31:02.832
Yes. What?

31:04.142 --> 31:06.133
No! How could he?

31:08.480 --> 31:10.812
Don't you worry.
She'll be there.

31:10.882 --> 31:12.873
Yeah. I'll see you later.

31:12.951 --> 31:15.681
- Mm!
- What?

31:15.754 --> 31:18.245
That creep Forbes
did a number on us.

31:18.323 --> 31:20.917
He got his cronies to push the bill
through committee last night,

31:20.992 --> 31:24.086
and he's bringing it up for a vote
before the full Senate this afternoon.

31:24.162 --> 31:25.993
He knew Maggie was out of town.

31:26.064 --> 31:28.624
Russell Forbes is as slick as they come.

31:28.700 --> 31:31.498
He knows that if Maggie isn't there,
the opposition will fall apart.

31:31.570 --> 31:34.471
That's okay.
I'll go up and get her.

31:34.539 --> 31:37.599
I'll call the retreat and tell her
I'm on my way.

31:44.950 --> 31:47.145
What's wrong?

32:10.976 --> 32:15.936
And yet I maintain that only by
standing up for our ideals,

32:16.014 --> 32:20.610
by striking out against injustice,

32:20.685 --> 32:24.621
- and acting to improve
the lot of others...

32:24.689 --> 32:27.385
Can we advance the cause
of freedom...

32:29.127 --> 32:32.290
and enrich this world.

32:46.278 --> 32:48.371
Position yourselves
straight up the road a ways.

32:48.446 --> 32:50.971
Anybody try to get through,
stop 'em.

32:55.587 --> 32:58.988
We got this place sealed off
tighter than a drum.

32:59.057 --> 33:01.423
Ain't no way that lady's
getting out of here now.

33:05.730 --> 33:07.664
Michael, do you really think
they're in trouble?

33:07.732 --> 33:09.723
One thing I learned
in the Special Forces...

33:09.801 --> 33:13.168
when you cut off an enemy's line of
communication, you cut 'em off from help.

33:13.238 --> 33:15.229
But why would somebody
do something like that?

33:15.307 --> 33:19.073
My guess is someone doesn't want
Maggie to find out about the vote today.

33:19.144 --> 33:22.079
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
that's my guess too.

33:22.147 --> 33:25.275
It's up to us to make sure that she
not only finds out about the vote...

33:25.350 --> 33:27.341
but has a chance
to do something about it.

33:27.419 --> 33:31.651
What is going on here? I've tried to
reach my office, and the phones are dead.

33:31.723 --> 33:36.092
Yes. I know. Well, don't give me that
British "stiff upper lip" routine.

33:36.161 --> 33:39.597
Now, what's going on out
there? We're under siege.

33:39.664 --> 33:43.361
We're what? A unidentified group of
armed men have set up a roadblock.

33:43.435 --> 33:45.733
We're cut off.

33:45.804 --> 33:48.602
Well, I knew Forbes
was desperate to stop me,

33:48.673 --> 33:50.664
but I never thought
he'd go this far.

33:50.742 --> 33:54.303
- Do you think he's responsible?
- Well, maybe not directly,

33:54.379 --> 33:56.370
but who else except
the men he works for...

33:56.448 --> 33:58.882
would be ruthless enough
to try a stunt like this?

33:58.950 --> 34:01.817
None of this would have happened
if I'd left well enough alone.

34:01.886 --> 34:04.150
I should never
have brought you here.

34:04.222 --> 34:08.181
Will you knock off the hindsight and try
to figure out a way to get me out of here?

34:26.110 --> 34:28.670
Hey! Hey! Stop!

34:34.319 --> 34:37.219
Sounds like our first visitor's
arriving sooner than expected.

34:37.288 --> 34:39.279
Get ready for him.

34:40.625 --> 34:42.592
Michael, there's a roadblock up ahead.

34:42.659 --> 34:47.097
I'm almost afraid to ask this,
but how are we gonna get past them?

34:47.165 --> 34:49.531
May I suggest
we continue down the road?

34:49.601 --> 34:53.469
- You got it, KITT. My sentiments exactly.
- But it's blocked!

34:53.538 --> 34:56.768
Well, then I guess we'll just
have to go over 'em.

34:59.344 --> 35:02.313
Oh, no.

35:05.483 --> 35:08.418
What the hell's goin' through
that boy's head? Watch out!

35:10.455 --> 35:15.791
Michael!

35:23.735 --> 35:25.726
What's that?

35:25.804 --> 35:28.898
Sounds like KITT.

35:46.825 --> 35:48.850
Michael.

35:48.927 --> 35:51.623
Maggie, hop in the car.
We gotta get you back into town.

35:51.696 --> 35:54.824
What? They're taking a vote on the
power bill in less than two hours.

35:54.899 --> 35:57.459
Oh, I thought as much.
Devon, are you gonna be all right?

35:57.535 --> 35:59.799
Yes, yes. They don't care about us.
Get in the car, Maggie.

35:59.871 --> 36:03.534
Maggie, will you just get going? You're
gonna be late. All right, come on. Let's go.

36:03.608 --> 36:06.873
I hope you're as good getting out of
here as you were getting in. So do I.

36:06.945 --> 36:10.813
- Good luck!
Michael! This isn't the way out.

36:10.882 --> 36:13.646
It is now.

36:25.763 --> 36:27.856
I'd like to see him
try to get past us now.

36:27.932 --> 36:30.423
We're gonna bypass the roadblock.

36:43.581 --> 36:45.515
- Holy Toledo!
- How does he do it?

37:12.176 --> 37:15.543
It's okay. It's okay, Maggie.
KITT's got a pretty thick skin.

37:15.613 --> 37:18.605
Please be precise, Michael.
It's not thick.

37:18.683 --> 37:20.617
It's simply a bulletproof alloy.

37:20.685 --> 37:23.176
I can't tell you
how I'm counting on that.

37:36.534 --> 37:38.866
What do you mean she got away?

37:38.937 --> 37:43.533
All I know is this guy's not gonna get caught
from behind. I need all the help I can get.

37:43.608 --> 37:47.237
All right. I'll arrange all that.
You just try to stay on his tail.

37:47.312 --> 37:49.075
Right.

37:56.054 --> 37:58.249
We'll take the shortcut
and cut 'em off further down.

37:58.323 --> 38:00.791
KITT, get ahold of the state police yet?

38:00.858 --> 38:03.725
Yes, Michael. Go ahead.
All right. Listen to me.

38:03.795 --> 38:07.026
There's been a terrorist assault on
the Foundation retreat at Blue Lake.

38:07.098 --> 38:11.899
A group of international dignitaries are
there, and their lives may be in danger.

38:13.204 --> 38:15.195
This is National Guard Unit 13.

38:15.273 --> 38:17.503
We're en route to the terrorist attack.
Over.

38:36.227 --> 38:39.162
There they are.
We've got 'em.

38:39.230 --> 38:43.667
Michael, I advise you to use the
rocket thrusters, or they'll cut us off.

38:51.943 --> 38:54.571
We lost 'em.
What's that car got in it?

38:58.549 --> 39:01.916
Michael, I detect a dangerous
obstruction in the road 200 yards ahead.

39:01.986 --> 39:04.511
Take the next left fork
up a hill.

39:14.065 --> 39:16.124
Where'd they go?

39:20.805 --> 39:22.966
Good work, KITT.

39:23.041 --> 39:26.306
Thank you, Michael.
It was all quite elementary.

39:36.154 --> 39:39.521
- I'm afraid we're not out of the woods yet.
- What do you mean?

39:40.992 --> 39:43.688
That's what he means.

40:07.819 --> 40:11.687
- Can we take a direct hit?
- I prefer not to find out.

40:11.756 --> 40:14.247
But the real problem
is the bridge at Twin Forks.

40:14.325 --> 40:17.692
They can take it out with two rockets,
and even I can't jump that far.

40:57.735 --> 41:00.727
KITT, open up the sunroof.

41:03.541 --> 41:06.704
Here. Take over, buddy.
You're on your own.

41:18.756 --> 41:22.123
Take it up. We're so close,
I think I can hit 'em.

42:25.323 --> 42:28.224
- Nice to have you back.
- Nice to be back.

42:37.802 --> 42:41.533
Michael, you're a very brave man.
Yeah.

42:41.606 --> 42:45.474
I just hope the next time you go
for a ride like this, you take me along.

42:45.543 --> 42:49.035
It's fun.
Yeah, it's a real blast.

42:49.113 --> 42:51.911
Outta sight.

43:13.471 --> 43:15.837
Ah. You're just in time. The
session convenes in a few minutes.

43:15.907 --> 43:19.638
I got the champagne on ice. Well,
let's hope we're able to celebrate.

43:19.710 --> 43:23.237
What's gonna stop us? Maggie
Flynn is on her way to the Capitol.

43:23.314 --> 43:27.307
What? I thought you told me... Just get out
there on the floor and see if you can move things.

43:27.385 --> 43:29.819
Now come on.
We don't have enough time.

43:35.927 --> 43:38.725
When does the afternoon session
begin? I think it already has.

43:38.796 --> 43:41.731
Hang on. It shouldn't take
us much longer. Perfect.

43:44.502 --> 43:48.939
You're saying that Maggie Flynn has
withdrawn her opposition to your bill?

43:49.006 --> 43:51.600
Don't believe it. It was a
shock to me as well, Mr. Speaker.

43:51.676 --> 43:54.167
But that's what she told me.
I just got off the phone with her.

43:54.245 --> 43:57.305
And she said she wasn't even
gonna show up for the vote?

43:57.381 --> 44:00.873
I think that's more
a face-saving gesture.

44:00.952 --> 44:04.217
It'd be really embarrassing for her
to throw in her towel in public.

44:04.288 --> 44:06.279
She's a proud woman.

44:18.836 --> 44:21.202
Give 'em hell, Maggie!

44:37.888 --> 44:40.254
If no senator wishes to speak
in opposition to the bill,

44:40.324 --> 44:42.315
we'll proceed with the vote.

44:42.393 --> 44:45.692
All in favor of the Portage River
Power Act,

44:45.763 --> 44:49.062
- signify by saying...
- Point of order, Mr. Speaker!

44:49.133 --> 44:51.294
I wish to speak
in opposition to the bill.

44:51.369 --> 44:53.894
You may have the floor, Senator.

45:17.194 --> 45:20.095
Ah, Mr. Dixon.
Your friend Luger here...

45:20.164 --> 45:24.863
had some very interesting things to say
about you while we were flying back to town.

45:24.935 --> 45:27.062
Would you come with us, please?

45:31.976 --> 45:34.069
All right! All right!
All right, all right.

45:47.091 --> 45:49.082
It's not fair, you know.

45:49.160 --> 45:51.958
A fancy dinner to celebrate our victory,
and I don't even get to be there.

45:52.029 --> 45:54.554
Maggie, my love, we'd be delighted
to bring the party to you.

45:54.632 --> 45:58.659
I love Palm Beach at this time of year.
By the way, is the fishing good?

45:58.736 --> 46:02.103
All I've seen is the airport,
the hotel and the convention hall.

46:02.173 --> 46:04.164
How is the response, Maggie?

46:04.241 --> 46:08.940
Have you ever tried to talk to a roomful of
diamond-studded country-clubbers about world hunger?

46:09.013 --> 46:11.538
After what you've just been through,
that should be easy,

46:11.615 --> 46:13.879
unless you want me and KITT
to come down and help you out.

46:13.951 --> 46:17.216
Not this time, thanks. You've
already done your bit for democracy.

46:17.288 --> 46:20.985
"Democracy." The absence of hereditary
or arbitrary class distinctions.

46:21.058 --> 46:24.255
A system of government based on
rule of the majority...

46:24.328 --> 46:26.353
somewhat idealistic, but functional.

46:26.430 --> 46:28.421
I never said it was perfect, KITT.

46:28.499 --> 46:32.333
But with a little nudge every now and then to
keep it on the right track, we may get lucky.

46:32.403 --> 46:35.531
Perhaps you'd find it stimulating, Senator,
to participate in a dialogue with me...

46:35.606 --> 46:39.064
on democracy versus imperialism,
socialism...

46:39.143 --> 46:42.078
KITT, can it, will ya?
We're almost at the restaurant.

46:42.146 --> 46:44.637
We'll miss you, Maggie.
Yes, Maggie.

46:44.715 --> 46:47.479
We'll have a drink
to your continued success.

46:47.551 --> 46:51.112
I'll be thinking of you too.
- And I'll be waiting in the parking lot.

46:51.188 --> 46:53.281
Bye, Maggie. Take care.
Good-bye.

47:04.268 --> 47:06.259
Oh, boy. I'm starved.
Good.

47:06.337 --> 47:08.669
Order anything you want,
and don't look at the prices.

47:08.739 --> 47:11.503
The Foundation's
picking up the tab. Mmm.

47:11.575 --> 47:13.770
I am?

47:15.012 --> 47:17.310
Uh, that's not necessary.

47:18.449 --> 47:21.441
I prefer to find my own place.

47:51.549 --> 47:54.814
One man can make a difference, Michael.

47:57.688 --> 48:01.784
Michael Knight, a lone crusader
in a dangerous world,

48:01.859 --> 48:04.521
the world of the Knight Rider.
