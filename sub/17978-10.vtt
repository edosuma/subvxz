12:10.067 --> 12:13.067
THE THING
I REALLY CONNECTED TO

12:13.067 --> 12:15.333
WAS THE FUCKING INTENSITY
OF THE ROMANCE.

12:20.067 --> 12:21.600
MM-HMM.

LIKE, VISUALLY REALLY INTENSE.

JUST, LIKE, FADE AWAY,

12:31.867 --> 12:33.933
IT'S JUST JESSIE AND KARINA.

12:33.967 --> 12:35.333
KIND OF LIKE THAT FEELING

AND YOUR HEART BEGINS TO BEAT--

12:37.633 --> 12:39.467
YOUR MOUTH GOES DRY...

12:39.500 --> 12:41.267

KIND OF RUSHES

12:41.300 --> 12:42.233
FROM YOUR HANDS--

12:42.267 --> 12:44.100
YES, IN FACT,
WHAT YOU CAN DO

12:44.133 --> 12:45.733
IS YOU CAN JUST
FADE THE COLOR AWAY,

12:45.767 --> 12:46.733
JUST BLOW IT OUT.

12:46.767 --> 12:47.867
IN LAST MOVIE THAT I DID,

12:47.900 --> 12:51.367
I JUST SLOWLY
DRAINED THE COLOR--

12:51.400 --> 12:52.500

OH, MY GOD.

12:52.533 --> 12:53.933

THAT IS A VERY LONG
LESBIAN PHONE TREE CORD.

39:28.867 --> 39:29.900
ACTUALLY,
I DIDN'T HEAR IT

39:29.933 --> 39:31.067
ON THE GRAPEVINE.

39:31.067 --> 39:32.700
I GOOGLED TINA.

39:32.733 --> 39:34.433
REALLY?

39:34.467 --> 39:36.667
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT HER?

39:36.700 --> 39:37.867
I FOUND OUT THAT
SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE

39:37.900 --> 39:39.433
FOR SOME OF
MY FAVORITE MOVIES,

39:39.467 --> 39:42.367
AND THAT MADE ME
WANT TO WORK WITH HER.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.267
AND HER PICTURE
WAS HOT.

39:44.300 --> 39:46.200

39:46.233 --> 39:48.100
WHAT PICTURE?

39:48.133 --> 39:49.567

39:49.600 --> 39:51.200
AND YOU HAD
A TURQUOISE DRESS ON.

39:51.233 --> 39:53.633
[TINA]: OH, MY GOD,

[SHANE]: YEAH,
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

40:21.267 --> 40:24.100
I HAD TO MAKE SURE
SHE WAS GOING TO STICK.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.333

41:04.800 --> 41:06.733
HAS SHE BEEN DRINKING
ALL NIGHT?

41:06.767 --> 41:08.667
YEAH, A LITTLE. WHY?

41:08.700 --> 41:11.367
BECAUSE MY SISTER'S
A FUCKING ALCOHOLIC, THAT'S WHY.

KNOW ABOUT THAT.

41:13.967 --> 41:16.367

NOT YOUR PLACE

41:18.733 --> 41:21.900

TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE.

42:42.533 --> 42:43.933
WERE YOU?

42:43.967 --> 42:47.633
OR WERE YOU TRYING TO CONTROL
EVERYTHING

42:47.667 --> 42:49.567
AND INTERPRET

42:49.600 --> 42:51.400
WHAT YOU WANTED ME
TO HEAR AND TO KNOW?
