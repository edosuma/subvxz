10:23.071 --> 10:24.805
Then, after lunch,              
I had a patient.                

10:24.839 --> 10:26.307
Three separate                  
personalities,                  

10:26.341 --> 10:28.376
each one more boring            
than the other.                 

10:28.410 --> 10:30.378
As a matter of fact,            
he's the only one               

10:30.412 --> 10:33.114
who can tell them apart.        

10:33.148 --> 10:35.283
     Now, Lilith, darling,      
     let's remember our caveat. 

10:35.317 --> 10:36.250
     No more shop talk.         

10:36.284 --> 10:37.351
     It's the weekend.          

10:37.385 --> 10:38.518
             It's time to engage

10:38.553 --> 10:40.004
                 in nice, normal
                 conversation.  

10:40.038 --> 10:41.439
             I'll, uh, get us   
             some drinks. Woody?

10:41.473 --> 10:44.175
Why do you have this obsession  
with labeling everything?       

10:44.209 --> 10:47.578
     Normal, abnormal,          
     weekday, weekend.          

10:47.612 --> 10:49.813
Well, darling, I was only trying
     to create a certain...     

10:49.848 --> 10:51.882
        In other words,         
 control the conversation.      

10:51.917 --> 10:53.684
 That's rather compulsive,      
         isn't it?              

10:53.718 --> 10:55.920
Well, how anal of you to notice.

10:57.956 --> 11:00.091
 Oh, the whole world's anal     
            to you.             

11:00.225 --> 11:02.643
     Well, what say we, uh,     
     sleep in late tomorrow     

11:02.677 --> 11:04.011
    and have eggs Benedict?     

11:04.045 --> 11:04.811
         I love you.            

11:12.587 --> 11:13.854
        Pest control.           

11:14.756 --> 11:16.023
Where should we start?          

11:16.057 --> 11:17.875
         Excuse me.             
     What's this about?         

11:17.910 --> 11:19.210
Your rat problem.               

11:19.244 --> 11:20.544
                    Rat problem?

11:20.578 --> 11:22.780
Aren't you the one that called  
about a rat problem?            

11:22.814 --> 11:24.481
             No, of course not. 

11:24.516 --> 11:26.750
         No. We don't have rats.

11:26.785 --> 11:28.452
         Well, that's           
 what we understand, ma'am.     

11:28.486 --> 11:30.221
     Rats in the building--     
         big gray ones.         

11:30.255 --> 11:31.421
     That's why we're here.     

11:31.456 --> 11:32.790
             Excuse...          
             Everybody hold on. 

11:32.824 --> 11:34.091
         There are no rats here.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.294
Oh, of course, Rebecca,         
we believe you.                 

11:36.328 --> 11:38.812
If you should run across        
any white ones, about yea big,  

11:38.847 --> 11:41.749
I'd be happy to give you        
four dollars apiece for them.   

11:43.418 --> 11:44.585
 What do you use them for?      

11:44.619 --> 11:47.154
            Snacks.             

11:47.188 --> 11:49.623
             REBECCA:           
             Everyone just stay 
             where you are.     

11:49.658 --> 11:51.158
             There are no rats. 

11:51.192 --> 11:52.660
     Free round of drinks       
         on the house.          

11:52.694 --> 11:53.761
I wouldn't do that, ma'am.      

11:53.795 --> 11:55.163
Those little buggers            
might already                   

11:55.197 --> 11:56.464
have gotten into your beer.

                 I'll chance it.

11:59.751 --> 12:02.769
    Sam, did you call anyone    
     about a rat problem?       

12:02.804 --> 12:04.238
    No, no.                     
    We have a rat problem?      

12:04.272 --> 12:05.472
    Ew, God.                    

12:05.506 --> 12:06.707
                I didn't call,  
                you didn't call.

12:06.741 --> 12:08.142
                     Who called?

12:08.176 --> 12:10.361

                 we have rats?

Wait till he finds              

12:44.712 --> 12:46.997
        the prune juice         
        in his Kahlua.          

12:47.031 --> 12:48.699
Yeah, what about                
the sneezing powder             

12:48.733 --> 12:50.167
in the ventilation system, huh?

That was the coup de ville, huh?

Yeah, Gary's messed around

                 on their faces,

            are you, uh,        
            doing in here?

 No, no, I'm from Framingham.   

13:30.025 --> 13:31.625
 Uh, my wife's at Mass General. 

13:31.660 --> 13:33.260
 She just had a double bypass,

 unwind a little with a drink.

we're idiots or something?

                 have to admit, 

14:49.637 --> 14:51.372
         that when I first heard
         that you personally    

14:51.406 --> 14:52.706
                authorized some 
                of these pranks,

             ticked off myself. 

14:54.109 --> 14:55.426

                 I've met you,  

14:55.460 --> 14:57.261
why don't we call that

if I call you sometime          

15:14.528 --> 15:16.747
and maybe we go out             
for a cup of coffee?

        Uh, Mr., uh, Wade Boggs,

20:38.703 --> 20:40.170
                     what, uh...

20:40.205 --> 20:42.038
what are we batting these days? 

20:42.073 --> 20:43.540
Something like .360, huh?       

20:43.575 --> 20:45.442
                .361.           
                         NORM:  
                         Oh.    

20:45.476 --> 20:47.744
Well, welcome to Cheers,        
Mr.--                           

20:47.778 --> 20:50.647
( <i>gruff voice</i> ):                
Wade Boggs.                     

20:52.217 --> 20:55.018
         I thought you folks    
         were, uh, Red Sox fans.

20:55.052 --> 20:57.487
             Oh, yeah, we're,   
             we're Red Sox fans.

20:57.522 --> 21:00.357
         ( <i>chuckling</i> ):         
         Sure, Mr. Wade Boggs.  

21:00.391 --> 21:02.125
                    As a matter 
                    of fact, uh,

21:02.160 --> 21:04.594
we'd, uh, like to give you      
a nice welcome                  

21:04.628 --> 21:06.696

all great sports stars          

21:06.730 --> 21:08.565

21:08.599 --> 21:09.632
                ( <i>Cliff laughs</i> )

21:09.667 --> 21:11.401
                Maybe I ought to
                get out of here.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.235
Hurry, guys!                    
Let's get him!                  

21:12.270 --> 21:15.305
        ( <i>all shouting</i> )        

21:23.698 --> 21:25.932
         ( <i>shouting</i> )           

21:25.966 --> 21:27.467
            ( <i>Carla laughing</i> )  

21:27.502 --> 21:30.170
            Whoo-hoo!           

21:30.204 --> 21:32.972
     Man, that guy was          
 a lot quicker than he looked.  

21:33.007 --> 21:34.073
            Yeah. Let's, uh,    

21:34.108 --> 21:35.942
            check out this      
            guy's wallet.       

21:35.976 --> 21:38.478
            Find out who this   
            joker really was.   

21:38.513 --> 21:39.580
                 Yeah, this, uh,

21:39.614 --> 21:42.349
             this guy's name    
             was... Wade Boggs. 

21:42.383 --> 21:46.219
             Wait.              
                    Wow, what a 
                    coincidence.

21:46.253 --> 21:48.171
         Well, I guess Gary went
         to a lot of trouble    

21:48.206 --> 21:49.873
         to make up fake I.D.'s 
         for this guy and...    

21:49.907 --> 21:52.042
             credit cards and...

21:52.076 --> 21:55.045
     photo of him with          
     Jim Rice and Dwight Evans. 

21:56.680 --> 21:57.748
( <i>groans</i> )                      

21:57.782 --> 21:59.216
 Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, guys.  

21:59.250 --> 22:00.450
     I had a rough night.       

22:00.484 --> 22:02.352
     I was out showing          
     Gary's steady chick        

22:02.386 --> 22:03.519
     the time of her life.      

22:03.554 --> 22:04.554
         ( <i>laughing</i> )           

22:04.588 --> 22:06.373
                         Whoo.  

22:06.407 --> 22:08.291
     Did I miss anything?       

22:08.326 --> 22:09.993
No, no, just an average day.    

22:10.027 --> 22:11.862
We refilled the pretzel bowls,  

22:11.896 --> 22:14.665
played a little darts,          
pantsed Wade Boggs,             

22:14.699 --> 22:16.750
watched a little TV.            
            Wait, you did what? 

22:16.784 --> 22:19.936
Oh, man, we thought it was      
another one of Gary's tricks.   

22:19.970 --> 22:22.072
             So that's who was  
             running out there  

22:22.106 --> 22:24.074
    in his underwear in traffic.

22:24.108 --> 22:25.742
            You know, you see...

22:25.776 --> 22:27.511
     Gary has pulled off        
         the greatest,          

22:27.545 --> 22:29.279
         most ingenious         
     trick of them all.         

22:29.314 --> 22:31.215
He's gotten us to get ourselves.

22:31.249 --> 22:32.432
CLIFF:                          
Frasier's right.                

22:32.466 --> 22:34.067
We can't top this.              

22:34.102 --> 22:35.668
Gary's beaten us.               

22:35.703 --> 22:38.004
     You know, it's really      
     rather Machiavellian.      

22:38.038 --> 22:39.456
                            Hey.

22:39.490 --> 22:42.342
    Come on, guys.              

22:42.376 --> 22:44.861
    So we've been humiliated    
    in every sport.             

22:44.895 --> 22:46.179
     We've still got something  

22:46.213 --> 22:47.748
     that Gary can't take away. 

22:48.532 --> 22:49.983
                     Our pride? 

22:50.017 --> 22:52.652
    Hell, no.                   
    We never had that.          

22:52.687 --> 22:54.771
    We have got                 

22:54.805 --> 22:57.540
             the great          
             Wade Boggs' pants! 

22:59.260 --> 23:01.828
             Well, it's either  
             this or nothing.   

23:05.850 --> 23:07.517
    We're number one!           

23:07.552 --> 23:09.486
             ALL:               
     We're number one!          

23:09.520 --> 23:11.488
     We're number one!          

23:11.522 --> 23:12.789
     We're number one!

             We're number one!

             Hey!               
     We're number one!
