Sam.

00:58.149 --> 01:00.387
This is a surprise.

01:01.289 --> 01:02.959
Yeah.
I guess I should've called.

01:03.026 --> 01:05.196
Are you okay?

01:05.965 --> 01:08.369
Yeah. I j... I...

01:09.205 --> 01:10.675
I'm in therapy,

01:10.742 --> 01:13.280
and my therapist said
that I should...

01:13.346 --> 01:15.417
come and talk to you.

01:16.286 --> 01:17.989
You're in therapy?

01:18.056 --> 01:20.126
Mm-hmm.

01:48.350 --> 01:50.286
H-How's Hara doing?

01:51.991 --> 01:54.562
She just turned 12 last month.

01:54.629 --> 01:55.998
Mm.

01:56.065 --> 01:58.302
Her reading's getting better.

01:59.238 --> 02:00.875
It turns out she's pretty fast.

02:00.941 --> 02:04.850
She likes running races
against the boys.

02:06.754 --> 02:10.260
Have you heard
of panta bhat and fuchka?

02:11.663 --> 02:12.398
No.

02:12.464 --> 02:14.301
That's what she eats.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.905
Her favorites.

02:16.673 --> 02:18.277
I'm surprised
you haven't heard of those,

02:18.343 --> 02:19.914
with all the...

02:19.980 --> 02:21.583
places you eat.

02:25.357 --> 02:27.394
Did you tell her about us?

02:28.363 --> 02:30.000
That's against the rules.

02:30.067 --> 02:35.177
You don't tell them
about divorce or anything...

02:35.243 --> 02:37.815
upsetting in your family.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.220
Mm. Right.

02:41.791 --> 02:44.161
I actually have
another one now, too.

02:44.228 --> 02:45.197
Muntaha.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.871
Wow.

02:49.640 --> 02:50.808
Do you want to see a picture?

02:50.875 --> 02:51.977
- Sure.

03:00.093 --> 03:01.630
Wow.

03:06.172 --> 03:07.575
She's cute.

03:07.642 --> 03:10.648
Yeah, and she also likes
panta bhat and fuchka.

03:24.943 --> 03:28.884
Alan, can you
come closer to the door?

03:38.770 --> 03:40.140
I'm here.

03:40.207 --> 03:41.475
Listen.

03:43.012 --> 03:45.383
Your hands are free, right?

03:46.152 --> 03:47.321
Yeah.

03:47.388 --> 03:48.957
And you said you have...

03:49.024 --> 03:52.264
like, meetings with him.

03:52.331 --> 03:54.235
Appointments?

03:54.301 --> 03:56.707
- Sessions.
- Sessions.

03:56.774 --> 04:00.414
Do you think you could have one
with him here now?

04:00.481 --> 04:02.485
We... actually do.

04:02.552 --> 04:04.122
We do have them here.

04:04.188 --> 04:05.925
Great.

04:05.992 --> 04:07.394
That's weird. Right?

04:07.461 --> 04:08.597
Yeah, it's weird.

04:08.664 --> 04:10.701
I don't really have a choice.

04:12.471 --> 04:15.845
We're both prob-probably going
to be dead soon.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.690
I say we go down swinging.

04:22.457 --> 04:25.632
Next time you have
one of your sessions,

04:25.698 --> 04:28.771
I want you to convince him
to bring me in.

04:28.837 --> 04:32.278
Make up some...
good therapy reason.

04:33.313 --> 04:34.816
And once I'm there,

04:34.883 --> 04:35.952
you jump him.

04:36.019 --> 04:38.624
And I'll, like...

04:38.691 --> 04:40.794
throw my body on him, too.

04:47.776 --> 04:49.846
Did you see Kenny last summer?

04:51.182 --> 04:53.019
Mm-hmm. Twice.

04:53.954 --> 04:55.791
Raleigh and Chicago.

04:55.858 --> 04:57.628
Chicago was...

05:10.020 --> 05:13.694
What did your therapist
want you to talk to me about?

05:15.296 --> 05:18.336
I don't know. He just said
I should come talk to you.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.039
So...

05:38.611 --> 05:41.483
You never picked up
your La-Z-Boy.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.386
Do you still want it?

05:48.463 --> 05:50.033
Okay.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.268
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

05:51.335 --> 05:53.172
All right.

05:53.239 --> 05:54.976
Okay, just try and get it in.

05:55.711 --> 05:57.783
All right, go. One, two, three.

05:57.849 --> 05:59.719
- That's...
- No? Okay.

05:59.786 --> 06:01.122
- No.
- All right.

06:01.188 --> 06:02.792
Okay.

06:05.831 --> 06:07.033
Go.

06:26.105 --> 06:27.875
Thanks.

07:07.253 --> 07:08.824
Elias?

07:09.559 --> 07:10.995
Yeah.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.107
You gave me a message
for your family.

07:17.174 --> 07:20.180
But you may be the one
who gets out of here. So...

07:20.247 --> 07:23.854
I'd like to give you a message
for mine, too.

07:28.095 --> 07:29.766
Okay.

07:30.834 --> 07:32.772
Okay.

07:34.041 --> 07:38.049
Tell my daughter, Shoshana,
that I love her.

07:38.784 --> 07:41.623
And that I treasured
our life together.

07:42.526 --> 07:43.827
And that...

07:43.894 --> 07:46.933
I want her to find a way
to move on.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.674
Ezra, my son--

07:50.741 --> 07:52.979
tell him I loved him very much

07:53.045 --> 07:55.751
and that his mother
loved him, too.

07:56.586 --> 07:58.924
Even when it was difficult
between them.

08:01.195 --> 08:02.363
And that I'm...

08:02.430 --> 08:05.069
sorry that there was so much...

08:05.136 --> 08:08.710
conflict in the family
when she was dying

08:08.777 --> 08:10.079
and that I...

08:12.250 --> 08:13.453
That's a lot to remember.

08:13.521 --> 08:15.557
Um, just...

08:16.693 --> 08:19.097
Just tell them
what you can remember.

08:36.165 --> 08:37.635
Can you k...

08:37.702 --> 08:39.304
keep talking?

08:39.371 --> 08:41.175
Please?

08:47.453 --> 08:49.593
When Ezra went to college...

08:50.360 --> 08:53.534
...he fell in with one of
those rabbis with the black hats

08:53.600 --> 08:54.969
and...

08:55.036 --> 08:58.042
suddenly he's an Orthodox Jew.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.182
No parties.

09:01.983 --> 09:05.591
Doesn't turn the lights on
or off during the Sabbath.

09:07.127 --> 09:08.564
Beth, my wife...

09:09.766 --> 09:11.269
...this all...

09:11.335 --> 09:13.607
just drove her crazy.

09:14.676 --> 09:16.412
Everybody following
their own paths

09:16.479 --> 09:18.984
wasn't exactly her cup of tea.

09:19.050 --> 09:22.725
I did my best
to help her with it, but...

09:23.928 --> 09:26.165
...Ezra did not make it easy.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.806
His family could not
even come over to our house

09:29.872 --> 09:31.677
without bringing their own food.

09:31.743 --> 09:34.347
You know about kosher food?

09:35.751 --> 09:38.289
It's regular food
with a thousand rules.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.464
This one birthday party

09:42.532 --> 09:44.536
for Ezra's son...

09:44.602 --> 09:47.274
she wanted to bring some...

09:52.450 --> 09:54.254
He's back.

10:39.278 --> 10:40.948
I got my chair back.

10:42.317 --> 10:44.020
So you saw her?

10:45.156 --> 10:46.291
Yeah.

10:47.260 --> 10:49.030
What did you talk about?

11:09.004 --> 11:11.241
She's got these kids...

11:11.976 --> 11:14.048
...who we adopted in Bangladesh.

11:14.114 --> 11:17.153
We adopted 'em from this...

11:17.220 --> 11:18.089
organization.

11:18.156 --> 11:20.994
I mean,
we-we adopted one of 'em.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.002
She just got another one.

11:25.737 --> 11:27.842
And...

11:27.908 --> 11:30.146
she loves them a lot.

11:31.849 --> 11:33.987
How did it feel seeing her?

11:35.489 --> 11:36.492
Yeah.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.561
I liked it.

11:37.628 --> 11:39.064
Mm.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.735
But I don't think
it accomplished

11:40.801 --> 11:42.403
what you were hoping.

11:42.470 --> 11:44.407
Like, diverting me.

11:47.815 --> 11:51.723
These kids of Mary's
and yours...

11:52.490 --> 11:53.727
...when they grow up,

11:53.794 --> 11:55.764
I bet you want them
to be responsible

11:55.831 --> 11:57.835
for the things they do in life.

11:57.901 --> 12:00.641
It has to be hard in Bangladesh.

12:00.708 --> 12:03.212
You want them to overcome, not...

12:03.279 --> 12:05.518
blame everything
on their circumstances

12:05.584 --> 12:07.087
or the people who hurt them.

12:07.154 --> 12:09.559
That's part of what
we're talking about here, Sam...

12:09.626 --> 12:12.765
Can you imagine me beating
the shit out of those kids?

12:12.832 --> 12:14.435
Like...

12:14.502 --> 12:16.673
punching 'em, hitting 'em

12:16.739 --> 12:18.476
like they're
worthless pieces of shit?

12:18.544 --> 12:20.246
How can anybody...

12:21.783 --> 12:23.353
Yeah, I'm gonna do this now.

12:23.419 --> 12:24.823
Wait. Wait. Wait! Sam!

12:24.889 --> 12:26.425
- No. Listen to me!
- This guy's gonna get it.

12:26.492 --> 12:28.998
- He's gonna get it right now.
- Candace! Get down here!

12:29.064 --> 12:31.369
Get down here! Right now!

12:31.435 --> 12:33.941
- We have a problem down here!
- No! No!

12:34.007 --> 12:35.778
- Sam?
- No! No, no, no...

12:35.844 --> 12:37.581
No, please.
Please.

12:37.648 --> 12:39.986
- Oh, Sam, stop!
- Wait, please, please.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.625
- Wait, wait.
- Mom, go back upstairs.

12:42.691 --> 12:44.028
No. You listen to me.

12:44.094 --> 12:45.297
Stop right now.

12:45.363 --> 12:47.702
You are supposed
to be protecting me

12:47.769 --> 12:49.304
by not doing this.

12:50.941 --> 12:53.045
- Get back here!

13:03.432 --> 13:04.569
What?

13:04.636 --> 13:07.040
Go to your room.

13:07.808 --> 13:09.444
Right now.

13:11.014 --> 13:12.951
- I don't want to.
- Sam.

13:13.753 --> 13:15.356
You need
your good night's sleep.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.532
You know, sometimes
you feel better after that.

14:00.681 --> 14:02.618
Fuck!

14:03.620 --> 14:04.689

Here, come sit with me

17:57.420 --> 18:00.761
Why don't we play one
of your favorite songs, then?

18:00.827 --> 18:02.698
What song should we play?

18:02.765 --> 18:04.401
- What's your favorite song?
-"Got That Shabbat."

18:04.468 --> 18:05.937
"I Got That Shabbat Feeling"?

19:13.205 --> 19:14.641
Come, sit down.

19:39.257 --> 19:42.698
You told me
that you get very angry

19:42.765 --> 19:45.269
with people
who treat you rudely.

19:46.471 --> 19:48.442
That everyone you hurt

19:48.510 --> 19:51.616
somehow deserves
what happens to them.

19:51.682 --> 19:53.619
And...

19:53.686 --> 19:55.022
I'm starting to think that

19:55.088 --> 19:58.896
that's not actually
what's going on, Sam.

20:02.103 --> 20:03.840
What do you mean?

20:04.942 --> 20:08.750
What I mean is, after everything
you went through as a child,

20:08.817 --> 20:09.918
you are angry,

20:09.985 --> 20:12.858
as anyone would be
who experienced that.

20:12.924 --> 20:16.064
And that anger
has made you violent.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.770
Which is also very human. So...

20:18.837 --> 20:20.072
really, Sam,

20:20.139 --> 20:23.479
you are just looking for people

20:23.546 --> 20:25.817
who will serve as an excuse

20:25.884 --> 20:28.856
for you to act out
those feelings.

20:30.092 --> 20:32.196
And the people
that you choose--

20:32.263 --> 20:35.002
I-I think it's almost random.

20:35.770 --> 20:39.010
If you run into someone when
you are in that state of mind,

20:39.076 --> 20:42.751
I think you will find a way

20:42.818 --> 20:46.158
- to be offended by them.
- No, you're wrong.

20:46.225 --> 20:48.663
Those people, each and every
one of those people

20:48.730 --> 20:50.767
is a fucking asshole.
You weren't there.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.272
You were never there.
That piece of shit,

20:53.338 --> 20:55.042
he acts however he wants.

20:55.108 --> 20:56.478
He treats people like shit.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.817
I understand why
you feel that way.

20:58.883 --> 21:00.620
I know

21:00.687 --> 21:03.225
that is what
you are experiencing.

21:03.292 --> 21:05.295
But part of therapy

21:05.362 --> 21:09.471
is finding a way to look beyond

21:09.539 --> 21:12.309
what you are experiencing
in the moment

21:12.376 --> 21:15.449
and to search more deeply.

21:16.384 --> 21:19.457
Sam, I think this
is a great opportunity

21:19.525 --> 21:21.662
for you to search more deeply.

21:21.729 --> 21:24.000
I know it's what you want.

21:24.066 --> 21:27.874
I know it's why we are
both here right now.

21:30.046 --> 21:33.719
I want you to consider
what I just told you.

21:36.191 --> 21:38.361
May I tell you something more?

21:39.565 --> 21:41.168
I don't know.

21:41.234 --> 21:43.204
I think you are angry

21:43.271 --> 21:47.479
because of what your father did,
like you always said.

21:47.547 --> 21:49.484
But I think it connects
with your father

21:49.551 --> 21:51.120
on deeper levels as well.

21:51.187 --> 21:54.060
You said that he would beat you

21:54.127 --> 21:56.264
if you didn't do

21:56.331 --> 21:58.570
exactly what he said instantly.

21:58.636 --> 22:01.175
If you even took a moment
to think about it.

22:01.241 --> 22:03.345
Isn't that what you said?

22:03.412 --> 22:05.817
Mm-hmm.

22:05.884 --> 22:08.155
So that was, like, his reason

22:08.221 --> 22:10.794
to hurt you, in his mind.

22:10.861 --> 22:12.463
But then that
got into your mind.

22:12.531 --> 22:15.369
So you-you think
that there is a reason

22:15.435 --> 22:19.010
that all of these people are
behaving this way towards you,

22:19.077 --> 22:20.647
when in reality,

22:20.714 --> 22:23.251
they're just
going about their business.

22:24.020 --> 22:27.794
They didn't do anything
to provoke your attacks

22:27.861 --> 22:30.032
any more than you did
to provoke your father.

22:30.099 --> 22:34.474
He was just a violent,
out of control abuser.

22:34.542 --> 22:38.349
You weren't responsible.

22:38.415 --> 22:40.787
You were just a little boy.

22:42.256 --> 22:44.361
Elias Petraki in there...

22:45.129 --> 22:48.101
...he didn't do anything
to deserve this either.

22:48.168 --> 22:52.043
He's just a guy who cooks,
manages a Greek restaurant,

22:52.109 --> 22:53.613
makes food that you like.

22:53.679 --> 22:56.017
He got into a little tangle
with you

22:56.084 --> 22:58.590
over an inspection,

22:58.657 --> 23:00.827
and he might have
looked at you funny

23:00.894 --> 23:03.533
or been obnoxious
or disrespectful.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.402
He looked at me...

23:06.238 --> 23:08.241
He looked at me like I was...

23:08.308 --> 23:11.616
I was... a son of a bitch.

23:11.683 --> 23:12.985
You know,
it doesn't-it doesn't...

23:13.051 --> 23:14.621
- it doesn't-it doesn't matter.
- Sam.

23:14.688 --> 23:16.357
- He's-he's... he's...
- Sam.

23:16.424 --> 23:19.197
I want you
to bring Elias out here

23:19.263 --> 23:20.399
so the three of us can talk.

23:23.405 --> 23:25.109
What would the point
of that be?

23:25.176 --> 23:27.681
You seem to think that
he is such a horrible person

23:27.747 --> 23:30.253
that he doesn't deserve to live.

23:30.319 --> 23:32.657
Let's see

23:32.724 --> 23:34.895
- if there's more to him.
- I don't want to.

23:37.467 --> 23:39.170
- I want him dead.
- I know you do,

23:39.237 --> 23:41.608
but I think

23:41.675 --> 23:43.980
the three of us talking
could be an important

23:44.047 --> 23:45.984
- part of our work.
- These aren't his
therapy sessions. These are

23:46.051 --> 23:48.288
- my therapy sessions.
- I'm not suggesting that

23:48.355 --> 23:50.259
we do this for him.

23:50.325 --> 23:52.196
This is your therapy.

24:51.582 --> 24:55.055
I've gotten to know Elias some,

24:55.122 --> 24:58.095
and I think he's
a good young man.

24:58.161 --> 25:02.637
And I think
if you get to know him,

25:02.704 --> 25:06.244
you will feel differently
about him.

25:11.955 --> 25:13.759
Elias,

25:13.826 --> 25:17.701
we want you to show
your full self here

25:17.768 --> 25:21.374
so he can see you
as something more

25:21.441 --> 25:23.045
than he does right now.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.951
Do you think that
you could tell him

25:26.017 --> 25:29.090
a little bit about yourself?

25:29.157 --> 25:32.229
I know how hard this is,
given the circumstances,

25:32.296 --> 25:35.770
but... do your best.

25:39.044 --> 25:42.149
Okay. Um...

25:44.053 --> 25:46.759
Why don't you tell him
about the pastitsio,

25:46.825 --> 25:49.931
and how you
came up with that idea.

25:52.269 --> 25:54.474
O... Okay.

25:54.541 --> 25:56.211
Um...

25:58.582 --> 26:02.089
It's okay.
I know this is hard.

26:02.156 --> 26:04.929
Tell him about it.

26:04.995 --> 26:07.233
How you were in Asia.

26:07.300 --> 26:11.040
Okay.
Yeah, I...

26:12.744 --> 26:16.451
Okay.

26:16.518 --> 26:17.821
I work in a restaurant

26:17.888 --> 26:21.863
with... with my parents.

26:21.929 --> 26:25.068
They-they came from Greece.

26:25.135 --> 26:27.172
All that way. They...

26:27.239 --> 26:28.776
they had a-a dream to...

26:28.843 --> 26:33.218
What? What? Wh...

26:33.284 --> 26:34.788
Should I, uh...

26:34.855 --> 26:37.226
I-I... Okay.

26:37.994 --> 26:39.832
So, I-I had this idea

26:39.899 --> 26:42.303
- to com-to combine
udon noodles...
- I...

26:42.369 --> 26:44.942
- No, no. No, no, no!

26:45.008 --> 26:46.546
- Alan!
- No, no, no! No.

26:46.613 --> 26:48.582
No! Candace!

26:48.649 --> 26:51.187
No! (coughs) Don't...

26:51.254 --> 26:53.258
No, God. Candace!

26:54.661 --> 26:57.433
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

26:57.500 --> 27:00.573
- Oh, God, no!

27:00.640 --> 27:05.015
No. Oh!

27:05.082 --> 27:07.085
No!

27:13.365 --> 27:15.236
No! No, God!

27:15.302 --> 27:18.676
No, no, no, no!

27:18.743 --> 27:20.446
No!

27:24.487 --> 27:26.257
No.
