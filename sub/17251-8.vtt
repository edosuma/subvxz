00:09.577 --> 00:10.844
SIR, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:10.878 --> 00:13.047

00:17.351 --> 00:18.986
- OH, WELL,
THAT IS VERY KIND, SIR,

00:19.019 --> 00:22.223
BUT WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO ACCEPT GRATUITIES.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.226
- JUST CLOSE THE GARAGE DOOR AND
LET ME FINISH WHAT I STARTED.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.827
- WELL, IT WOULDN'T MATTER.
YOU LEFT THE SKYLIGHT OPEN.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.995
- I COULDN'T FIND THE BUTTON.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.098
- WELL, HOW HARD DID YOU TRY,
SWEETIE?

00:30.131 --> 00:31.999
W--I'M STARIN' RIGHT AT IT.
WE PAINTED IT ORANGE.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.334

00:33.367 --> 00:35.035
- LAST TIME,
HE TRIED TO HANG HIMSELF.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.537
TIED THE ROPE TOO LONG.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.372
JUMPED OFF THE WORKBENCH
AND BROKE BOTH OF HIS ANKLES.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.907
THE NEIGHBOR KID
FOUND HIM HANGING THERE.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.342
- MOM, SHUT UP!

00:41.375 --> 00:42.843
- DON'T YOU TALK TO
YOUR MOTHER LIKE THAT.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.212
- STAY OUT OF THIS,
WOULD YOU, LARRY?

00:44.245 --> 00:46.214
- AND IF YOU "REALLY" WANT
TO COMMIT SUICIDE,

00:46.247 --> 00:49.049
YOU DON'T DO IT TWO BLOCKS
FROM AN AMBULANCE COMPANY!

00:49.083 --> 00:52.220
GET YOUR OWN PLACE,
NOT NEAR AN AMBULANCE COMPANY.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.854
IT'S GODDAMN RIDICULOUS.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.089
- SIR--
- NOW THE WHOLE HOUSE

00:55.123 --> 00:56.857
IS GONNA SMELL

01:04.132 --> 01:07.067

CLEANING THE GODDAMN CAR!

01:07.101 --> 01:10.070
FRICKIN' KID NEVER FINISHED
A THING IN HIS LIFE!

01:10.104 --> 01:11.372
- DO YOU THINK
HE'LL BE HOME FOR DINNER?

01:11.405 --> 01:13.207
I NEED TO KNOW
HOW MUCH HAM TO THAW.

01:13.241 --> 01:16.076
- AT LEAST MY KIDS DON'T TRY
TO KILL THEMSELVES ALL THE TIME.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.146
- THAT'S 'CAUSE THEY SELL WEED,
LARRY.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.583
IT'S GOOD SH--, ACTUALLY.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.118

01:44.505 --> 01:46.340
[radio static]

01:48.008 --> 01:50.444
- THAT MUST'VE BEEN A PRETTY
SCARY CALL FOR YOU, HUH, BRIAN?

01:50.478 --> 01:52.246
- YES, IT WAS.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.114
THAT GUY'S STEPDAD HAD
SOME SERIOUS ANGER ISSUES.

01:54.148 --> 01:57.017
- OH, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE KID, FUTURE BRIAN.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.452
- FUTURE BRIAN?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.087
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE CALLING HIM.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.355
SEE, FUTURE BRIAN
IS LIKE YOU IN TEN YEARS--

02:01.389 --> 02:03.424
SINGLE, LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS
IN THE BASEMENT.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.092
- SPOOKY.
- YOU GOT TO MOVE, BRO.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.960
- CUT THE CORD.
- YOU A GROWN-ASS MAN.

02:06.994 --> 02:09.430
- YOU AND FUTURE BRIAN EVEN
DRIVE THE SAME CAR, A SUBARU.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.664
COULD IT GET ANY SPOOKIER?

02:10.698 --> 02:13.201
- HEY, HOLD YOUR HORSES HERE,
FELLAS.

02:13.234 --> 02:16.136
FIRST OFF, I DRIVE AN OUTBACK.
HE DRIVES A FORESTER.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.305
IT'S A VERY DEPRESSING MODEL.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.772
- MY MISTAKE.
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.774
- PLUS HE PROBABLY MOVED
BACK IN WITH HIS PARENTS.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.976
I NEVER MOVED OUT.
THAT'S A LIFESTYLE CHOICE.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.278
- WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF,
BRIAN?

02:24.312 --> 02:26.113
- SERIOUSLY, BRO.
GET OUT ON YOUR OWN.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.448
DITCH THE DEAD WEIGHT.

THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

02:30.684 --> 02:33.787
I'M AFRAID OF THE DECLINING ROLE
OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY, OKAY?

02:33.821 --> 02:36.457
I'M AFRAID OF LOSING
THE GENERATIONAL BONDS

02:36.490 --> 02:39.660
THAT TIE US ALL TOGETHER.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.195
AND RENT.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.297
I'M REALLY AFRAID
OF PAYING RENT.

02:43.331 --> 02:46.534
IT'S A BIG, IRRESPONSIBLE,
AND ENDLESS FINANCIAL HOLE.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.302
YOU GUYS OWE ME 37 CENTS
BY THE WAY.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.570

03:10.524 --> 03:12.993
- SHE AIN'T MOVIN' EITHER.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.495
- SHOOTER'S HER EX.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.996
HE'S LOCKED AND LOADED

- WELL, WE SAVED
BRIAN'S DOPPELGANGER

03:30.244 --> 03:32.012
FROM KILLING HIMSELF.
- HE IS NOT MY DOPPELGANGER.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.347
- HE'S AT LEAST A DOPPEL.
- WE CALL HIM FUTURE BRIAN.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.616
- A CASUAL RESEMBLANCE AT BEST.
- HOW CASUAL?

03:35.649 --> 03:37.685
- HE LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS
AND DRIVES A SUBARU.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.420
- OY.
- IF HE WAS REALLY SUICIDAL,

03:39.453 --> 03:41.389
HE WOULDN'T DRIVE A CAR
WITH SUCH GOOD GAS MILEAGE.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.390

03:48.396 --> 03:49.563
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
FOR A PRETTY DECENT PRICE.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.365

BUT DID YOU KNOW

03:51.399 --> 03:53.634
THAT FINANCES ARE THE NUMBER ONE
CAUSE OF MARITAL DISCORD?

WE THOUGHT THEY WERE
FRIGGIN' SQUIRRELS.

- SURE I'M SURE.
IT'S A FLESH WOUND.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.585
IT MIGHT'VE NICKED THE BONE.
YOU'RE GONNA GET A COOL SCAR

04:44.618 --> 04:46.086
AND SOME PRETTY DECENT PAIN
PILLS OUT OF THE DEAL.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.121
BRIAN, GAUZE.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.595
AND I DIDN'T EVEN SCREAM
THAT LOUD.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.630

BREAK OFF SOME OF ITS LEGS
SO IT WON'T COME BACK AT ME.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.141
BREAK OFF SOME OF THE LEGS.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.477
SOMEONE SQUEAL LIKE THAT,

05:09.510 --> 05:12.112
IT WAS ME.
I WAS 13 AT A HANSON CONCERT.

SPEAKING OF YOUR HEAD, YOU KNOW
WHAT WE GOT TO GET YOU NOW?

05:29.363 --> 05:33.333
[laughs]

NOT A FAN, NOT A FAN.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.545
- JUST KIDDING, ASSHOLE.
GOD, YOU'RE A MESS.

05:44.578 --> 05:45.646
I DON'T HAVE ANY FEARS.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.147
- BULLSH--.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.749
I'M SCARED OF THE BIG THINGS.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.418
CANCER, TERRORISM, BEN AFFLECK
BEING A LOUSY BATMAN.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.219
- DON'T WORRY, MAN.
HE'S GONNA CRUSH IT.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.721
- EVERYBODY'S
SCARED OF SOMETHING.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.656
I'M SCARED OF LITTLE PEOPLE.
- MIDGETS?

05:55.689 --> 05:58.859
- I'M NOT SCARED OF THE WHOLE
MIDGET--JUST THE HANDS.

05:58.892 --> 06:03.497
SO SMALL AND SOFT,
LIKE THEY COULD JUST GRAB YOU

06:03.531 --> 06:06.767
AND YOU'D HARDLY FEEL IT.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.769
LIKE A WHISPER.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.774
I'M ALSO NOT VERY
FOND OF WIDE OPEN SPACES.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.609
PRAIRIES AND STUFF LIKE THAT?
MM-MM.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.445
MAKES ME FEEL SO INSIGNIFICANT.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.347
YOU EVER BEEN TO
THE GRAND CANYON, BILLY?

06:20.380 --> 06:21.749
DON'T GO.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.585
IN THE GRAND CANYON,
YOU ARE THE MIDGET.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.687
- MICROPHOBIA, BRIAN.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.623
THAT'S WHAT YOUR FEAR IS CALLED,
FEAR OF ALL THINGS TINY.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.358
- LIKE JOHNNY'S DICK.
[laughter]

06:31.391 --> 06:33.260
- HEY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME, BRO,
JUST BECAUSE A FEW HARMLESS BUGS

06:43.737 --> 06:45.706
TO BE GENUINELY AFRAID OF
IN THIS WORLD.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.709
ONE, THE MARS COMPANY
WILL STOP MAKING TWIXES.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.545
TWO, MY EX-WIFE.
AND THREE, ZOMBIES.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.380
- YOU'RE SCARED OF ZOMBIES?

06:53.413 --> 06:54.482
- YOU'RE NOT?

06:54.515 --> 06:55.449
- WHAT ARE YOUR FEARS, BILLY?

06:55.483 --> 06:57.384
- I DON'T GOT NONE, BRO.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.119
- MAN AFTER MY OWN HEART.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.888
- THAT'S RIGHT.
GO HIGH, BILL.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.724
- YOU WEREN'T AFRAID TODAY?
- NO, BRO.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.225
LIKE, TRY TO PUT YOURSELF
IN MY POSITION.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.327
LIKE, I'M WALKING

07:07.360 --> 07:09.830
GUY'S, LIKE, MAD CRAZY, RIGHT?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.799

I'M TALKING, LIKE,
SPEAKING IN TONGUES DRUNK.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.968
[babbles incoherently]

07:15.002 --> 07:18.405
WHAT'S THE WORST THING
THAT CAN HAPPEN?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.574
GET INSIDE MY HEAD.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.409

07:23.544 --> 07:26.580
LIKE, WHAT WAS I THINKING

07:26.614 --> 07:29.750
WHEN I WALKED IN THERE?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.785
- NOTHING?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.923
- SEE?
- MM.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.424
MM-HMM.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.828
- * GA-TO-RADE
GA-TO-RADE, YEAH *

07:40.861 --> 07:42.596
- GO HIGH, BRO.
- IS THAT A BEE?

07:42.630 --> 07:44.865
- PSST!
- [laughs]

07:44.898 --> 07:46.634
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
BILLY'S RIGHT.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.769
GUNFIRE'S JUST PART OF THE JOB.
YOU CAN'T FEAR IT.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.470
YOU JUST GOT TO LIVE
IN THE MOMENT.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.772
- SAME THING ON THIS JOB.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.206
IN THE HEAT OF THE BATTLE,
YOU JUST REACT.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.708
- EXACTLY.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.977
YOU KNOW, MY BIGGEST FEAR
ISN'T BEING SHOT.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.879
MY BIGGEST FEAR IS BEING
INVOLVED WITH A GUY

07:58.912 --> 08:01.214
WHOSE BIGGEST FEAR
ISN'T ME BEING SHOT.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.616
- UH-HUH.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.617
NOW YOU'RE SCARED.
LOOK AT HIS EYES.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.452
- NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.521
LET ME EXPLAIN.
I KNOW WHAT MY MAIN FEAR IS.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.456
MY NUMBER ONE FEAR
OF ALL FEARS

08:09.489 --> 08:12.359
IS THAT YOU MIGHT
GET SHOT SOMEDAY.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.794
I'M SO AFRAID OF IT.
- HMM.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.362
- EVERY SINGLE DAY,
I'M SO AFRAID OF IT

08:15.395 --> 08:17.330
EVERY DAY WHEN YOU GO TO WORK
THAT--THAT I SUBLIMATE IT.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.699
- OH, YOU SUBLIMATE IT.
- YEAH.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.133
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DO.
I SUBLIMATE IT.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.402
WHICH IS WHY EARLIER
IN THIS FEAR CONVERSATION,

08:22.435 --> 08:24.471
I DIDN'T SAY THAT THAT WAS
MY NUMBER ONE FEAR OF ALL FEARS

08:24.504 --> 08:30.377
BECAUSE I HAD SUBLIMATED IT
SO HARD...THAT I...

08:30.410 --> 08:31.845
THIS ISN'T GONNA FLY IS IT?
- NOPE.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.982
- HEY, YO.
CHECK THIS OUT.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.350
- [laughs]

08:37.384 --> 08:38.819
- YOU KNOW WHAT I FEAR?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.654
NOT FULFILLING MY POTENTIAL.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.757
SEE, BILLY'S ACTUALLY
ALREADY REACHED HIS.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.226
ME, I HAVEN'T.
- MM-HMM.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.396
- MY ONE DREAM IS TO WORK
FOR THE FBI IN WASHINGTON.

08:49.429 --> 08:50.864
SOMETIMES I'M AFRAID
IT WON'T WORK OUT,

08:50.898 --> 08:53.701
THAT I'LL, YOU KNOW,
TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT.

08:53.734 --> 08:57.004
THAT IS WHAT
I AM REALLY AFRAID OF,

08:57.037 --> 08:59.840
GROWING OLD AND LOOKING
BACK AT DREAMS

08:59.873 --> 09:01.341
THAT I NEVER MADE COME TRUE.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.276
- MM.
- HMM.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.446
- THAT AND THE SUN.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.716
- HELIOPHOBIA.
SURPRISINGLY COMMON.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.351
- MY SKIN BURNS AND PEELS IF
I FALL ASLEEP WITH THE IPAD ON.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.253
THAT IS WHY IF
THEY EVER STOPPED MAKING

09:13.286 --> 09:15.956
HYDRAMAX LAVENDER
REJUVENATION,

09:15.989 --> 09:17.691
I WOULD FREAK OUT
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.359
[laughs]
- HMM.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.394
- WHAT IS THAT FACE?

09:21.428 --> 09:25.298
- THEY DISCONTINUED THE CREAM.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.367
- THE ACTIVE PLUS FORMULA?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.302
- I'M SO SORRY, "T."

09:29.336 --> 09:31.038
- HANK, PLEASE JUST TELL ME
YOU'RE MESSING WITH ME.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.607
- I'M NOT MESSIN' WITH YOU.
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.575
THEY JUST WASN'T SELLIN'
ENOUGH OF 'EM.

09:35.609 --> 09:39.046
- HOLY SH--!

09:39.079 --> 09:40.781
BILLY, WE GOT TO GO.
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

09:40.814 --> 09:42.382
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M GONNA DO?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.484
I'M GONNA GO STORE TO STORE,
TRY AND FIND MYSELF A JAR.

09:44.517 --> 09:45.886
[horn honks]

09:45.919 --> 09:46.754
- [laughs]

09:46.787 --> 09:49.056
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

09:49.089 --> 09:50.658
- HEY!
- YO!

09:50.691 --> 09:52.059
HEY!
- OH, THIS GUY.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.461
[chuckling]

09:54.494 --> 09:56.596
[honking]

09:56.630 --> 09:59.833
- HEY! THANKS FOR NOTHING,
SCUMBAGS.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.669
- BYE.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.804
- WHO WAS THAT GUY?

10:03.837 --> 10:05.572
- THAT'S THE GUY WHO TRIED TO
COMMIT SUICIDE IN THE GARAGE.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.840
NOT VERY THANKFUL.

10:06.874 --> 10:07.975
- YOU GUYS DRIVE THE SAME CAR.

10:08.008 --> 10:11.845
[laughter]

10:15.816 --> 10:16.950
- THEY REALLY DIDN'T
CHARGE YOU FOR THAT?

10:16.984 --> 10:18.819
- THEY NEVER DO.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.854
WHEN YOU'RE WITH SOMEONE
WHO'S ABOUT TO MAKE A PURCHASE,

10:20.888 --> 10:22.923
YOU JUST SAY, "EXCUSE ME, SIR,
I BELIEVE I HAVE THE SNIFFLES,"

10:22.956 --> 10:24.658
AND THEY WILL GLADLY GIVE YOU

10:24.692 --> 10:26.794
A CUP OF HOT WATER
WITH LEMON AND HONEY.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.595
- AND YOU GONNA DRINK THAT?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.932
- AFTER A VISIT FROM
OUR FRIENDS AT LIPTON TEA.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.703
ANOTHER BENEFIT FROM LIVING
AT YOUR--HOLY COW, I CALL DIBS!

10:35.736 --> 10:37.971
- DIBS ON WHAT?

10:39.206 --> 10:40.440
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU REALLY THAT CHEAP?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.441
- NOT CHEAP, MY FRIEND.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.810
LUCKY.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.611
- BRIAN.
- WHOO!

10:44.644 --> 10:50.117
[laughter]

10:50.150 --> 10:52.452
- MAC'S BACK SCRATCHER ATTACHED
TO AN OLD RIG ANTENNA.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.721
GO HIGH, BRO.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.155
GO HIGH.
- EH.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.123
- DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.491
- [grunts]
- HUH?

10:58.525 --> 10:59.827
- CHICAGO NORTH
AMBULANCE NEEDED,

10:59.860 --> 11:01.161
CORNER OF NORTH SHORE DRIVE
AND EAST GRANT.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.730
- AMBULANCE 14 RESPONDING.
- [laughing]

11:02.763 --> 11:04.998
LET'S ROLL.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.403
[siren blaring]

11:14.507 --> 11:16.176
- CASH BEAT US.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.685
- WOW.
SO SAD.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.690
- MAN, THIS--
THIS IS HEARTBREAKING.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.827
- WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.428
THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.064
- DYING?

11:37.097 --> 11:38.598
I LIVE AS LONG
AS THAT LADY DID,

11:38.631 --> 11:40.167
I'D BE HAPPY
TO TAKE A DIRT NAP.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.401
- NOT HER, NUMBNUTS.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.204
HIM.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.707
- WHAT?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.743
- NEVER MIND.
LET'S GO.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.453
- WHAT?

12:00.487 --> 12:01.755
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.690
- WHY YOU GIVING ME THAT LOOK?
- WHAT LOOK?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.192
- YOU SEE THAT LOOK, BRIAN?

12:05.225 --> 12:08.128
- I SEE A LOOK.
NOT SURE WHAT IT IS.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.529
- IT'S THE "I KNOW SOMETHING
YOU DON'T KNOW" LOOK.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.064
I'VE SEEN IT A MILLION TIMES,

12:11.098 --> 12:13.700
EVERY TIME HE THINKS
HE'S ABOUT TO PSYCHOANALYZE ME.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.602
I'M NOT AFRAID OF BEING
LEFT ALONE, DR. PHIL,

12:15.635 --> 12:16.603
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE GETTIN' AT.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.905
- OKAY.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.372
- WHY WOULD I BE AFRAID
OF BEING LEFT ALONE?

12:19.406 --> 12:20.974
- BECAUSE YOUR FATHER
LEFT YOU AND YOUR MOTHER

12:21.008 --> 12:22.542
WHEN YOU WERE 13.
YOU NEVER GOT OVER IT.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.544
- BUT WE TALK NOW.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.213
ISSUE RESOLVED,
Q.E.D, ASSHAT.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.915
AND ALL YOUR IDEA,
I MIGHT ADD.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.783
- YOU THINK IT'S RESOLVED,
BUT IT'S NOT.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.151
IT'S BEEN SUBLIMATED.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.054
THAT SH-- SCARS DEEP TO
THE BONE, SLAP DICK.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.456
- HE'S RIGHT, JOHNNY,
ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL SCARRING.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.725
THE SLAP DICK THING
I'M NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.161
- WHEN MY DAD SKIPPED OUT ON ME,
HE DID ME A FAVOR.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.562
HE GAVE ME A GIFT.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.730
- WAS IT A BIKE?

12:43.763 --> 12:46.166
- WHAT? NO.
- NO?

12:46.199 --> 12:49.069
- IT'S THIS HARD OUTER SHELL I
USE TO DEFLECT PAIN AND SADNESS.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.072
- MM, BIKE WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.942
- TURTLE SHELL.
TURTLE SHELL.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.644
PAIN, TROUBLE--
BOUNCE RIGHT OFF.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.579
- THERESA LEAVES YOU.
- PING.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.014
- I MOVE TO MIAMI.
- PING.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.083
- OKAY.
WE SHALL SEE.

13:03.116 --> 13:03.917
- WE SHALL.
- YEAH, WE SHALL.

13:03.951 --> 13:04.918
- MM-HMM.
- MM-HMM.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.286
- HUH-HUH.
- WATCH.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.787
- STOP.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.789
- I HAD A TURTLE ONCE.
- AND?

13:09.823 --> 13:11.758
- HE RAN AWAY.
DIDN'T GET FAR.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.762
MADE IT TO THE DRIVEWAY WHERE MY
DAD ACCIDENTALLY RAN HIM OVER.

13:15.795 --> 13:21.101
DEFINITE EMOTIONAL
SUBLIMATION THAT DAY.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.503
- PING.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.771
- WOW.
THAT'S COLD-BLOODED.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.874
- WOW.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.909
- THE BOY LOST HIS TURTLE
AND YOU TALKIN' ABOUT "PING."

13:32.745 --> 13:36.116
- GOT YOU A PRESENT.
- WHY?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.851
- BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A SPIDER
IN MY LOCKER WHEN I OPENED IT.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.619
- OH, I SHOULD'VE
THOUGHT OF THAT!

13:39.652 --> 13:41.889
- IT'S THAT SKIN CREAM
THERESA USES.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.223
BUDDY OF MINE WORKS
IN A BEAUTY SUPPLY HOUSE.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.026
GOT THE LAST JAR
LEFT IN THE ENTIRE MIDWEST.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.195
- OHH, SMELLS JUST LIKE HER.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.230
- BECAUSE SHE SMEARS IT ON
THREE TIMES A DAY.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.331
YOU THOUGHT SHE SMELLED
LIKE THAT NATURALLY?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.133
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.334
- YOU KNOW I WASN'T BORN
SMELLING LIKE MICHAEL JORDAN.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.969
HAVE TO BUY THAT SH--.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.070
- THIS IS REALLY GONNA HELP ME
PATCH THINGS UP WITH HER.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.471
THANKS.
- EXACTLY.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.807
NOW, YOU SHOULD START
THINKING ABOUT HER MORE

14:00.840 --> 14:01.641
BEFORE SHE STARTS
THINKING ABOUT HER PARTNER.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.510
- OH, SHE'S NOT INTO BILLY.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.979
HE'S LIKE THE BOTTOM RUNG
IN A BAG OF HAMMERS.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.315
- HE'S A SHOCKINGLY HANDSOME GUY

14:08.348 --> 14:12.219
WHO SPENDS ALL DAY WITH HER
AND TACKLES INSANE, DRUNKEN,

14:12.252 --> 14:14.221
HEAVILY-ARMED
GIRLFRIEND SHOOTERS.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.356
YOU'RE A SELFISH PRICK
WHO DIDN'T EVEN THINK

14:16.389 --> 14:18.758
TO MENTION HER ON YOUR LIST
OF THINGS YOU FEAR.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.327
- HE'S A PASTE EATER.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.329
- MM-HMM, WHOSE COCK
IS BIGGER THAN SEATTLE SLEW'S,

14:22.362 --> 14:25.365
AND SHE'S SEEN IT.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.869
PING.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.240
- SHOOT.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.211
[chuckles]

14:45.885 --> 14:47.520
[knocks]

14:47.554 --> 14:49.389
THERESA,
WHY IS YOUR DOOR O--

14:52.225 --> 14:54.261
"T"?

14:58.331 --> 15:01.768
[fake laughs]

15:01.801 --> 15:05.973
OKAY, NICE JOB, HANK.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.075
GREAT DETAIL.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.810
VERY, VERY IMPRESSIVE.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.412
[chuckles]

15:12.445 --> 15:14.281
[gasps]

15:14.314 --> 15:16.216
OH!

15:16.249 --> 15:17.784
OHH!

15:17.817 --> 15:21.321
THIS IS LIKE THAT SAPPY
SANDRA BULLOCK LAKE HOUSE MOVIE

15:21.354 --> 15:23.256
YOU LOVE SO MUCH

15:23.290 --> 15:27.260
THE ONE THAT YOU CRY AT EVERY
TIME IT'S ON CABLE, PRINCESS.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.398
I'M GONNA READ IT NOW.
[chuckles]

15:31.431 --> 15:33.633
DEAR KEANU.
[laughs]

15:33.666 --> 15:35.568
JUST A LITTLE--JUST A LITTLE
TRIBUTE THERE, HANK.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.771
OH, YEAH, YOU ACTUALLY
GOT THERESA TO WRITE IT.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.273
THAT--WELL, THAT'S
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.941
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

15:41.975 --> 15:45.845
UM, "I'M SORRY YOU HAVE
TO FIND OUT THIS WAY,

15:45.878 --> 15:48.982
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO TELL YOU THIS IN PERSON."

15:49.016 --> 15:50.817
GREAT OPENING.

15:50.850 --> 15:51.784
MWAH!

15:51.818 --> 15:53.120
GREAT OPENING.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.522
"TODAY WAS MY LAST DAY
ON THE FORCE.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.124
"JUST TALKING ABOUT
MY POTENTIAL AT LUNCH

15:57.157 --> 15:58.825
"REALLY GOT ME TO THINKING
ABOUT MY LIFE

15:58.858 --> 16:00.127
"AND WHAT I'M DOING WITH IT.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.628
"AND I'M NOT GETTING
ANY YOUNGER.

16:01.661 --> 16:05.865
AND THERE'S NOTHING KEEPING ME
HERE IN CHHHHICAGO."

16:05.898 --> 16:08.868
[weak chuckle]

16:08.901 --> 16:10.437
HEY, GUYS?

16:10.470 --> 16:13.306
ALL RIGHT, HA-HA-HA.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.342

16:19.412 --> 16:23.283
AHA!

HOLY SH--.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.687
HOLY SH--,
HOLY SH--, HOLY SH--,

16:27.720 --> 16:28.721
HOLY SH--,
HOLY SH--, HOLY SH--.

16:28.755 --> 16:29.956
NO, THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.125

BILLY, THEY BETTER NOT BE
SELLING THAT FURNITURE, MAN.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.151
- JUST THAT LITTLE BIT OF THAT
$8 MILLION LOTION I RUBBED ON

19:45.184 --> 19:47.019

ABOUT THE AGING PROCESS.

A VALUABLE LESSON

20:12.712 --> 20:15.047
ABOUT THAT

STEPDAD IS RIGHT.

WE CAN DO THIS THE BIG WAY...

21:00.760 --> 21:03.463
OR THE LITTLE WAY.

21:03.496 --> 21:07.800
[laughs]

21:07.834 --> 21:09.936
AN OBVIOUS CHOICE, MIDGET.
