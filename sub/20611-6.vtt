00:01.635 --> 00:04.505
[dramatic music]

00:04.538 --> 00:09.743
*

00:09.777 --> 00:11.645
- My name's Larry Clements.
I came here because

00:11.679 --> 00:13.347
I absolutely love
the challenge.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.049
I'm ex-82nd Airborne.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.218
I go towards the battle.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.121
I don't run away from it.

00:20.154 --> 00:23.124
- I'm Brock Martin.
I'm the owner of WarFire Forge.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.159
We make a lot
of fantasy blades.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.627
I'm gonna be the next
"Forged in Fire" champion

00:26.660 --> 00:28.729
because I'm determined to win,

00:28.762 --> 00:33.234
and I may or may not have
poisoned the other contestants.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.535
- My name's Terry Mitchell.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.170
Once I learn something,

00:36.204 --> 00:37.738
I want to just do it
all the time,

00:37.771 --> 00:41.409
so I have made over
4,000 knives in four years,

00:41.442 --> 00:45.646
and I'm just gonna run
with it till it dies.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.448
- My name is Page Steinhardt.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.750
When I was 19,
I learned how to forge iron.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.819
I learned metallurgy
in the process to the point

00:51.852 --> 00:54.588
where I ended up as an associate
metallurgical engineer.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.757
Got to work on space
shuttle engine nozzles

00:56.790 --> 00:59.693
with a ninth-grade
math education.

00:59.727 --> 01:03.131
- Bladesmiths, welcome
to the Forge.

01:03.164 --> 01:06.334
You guys are here to compete
for $10,000 and a title,

01:06.367 --> 01:09.237
all under the scrutiny
of our panel of expert judges:

01:09.270 --> 01:11.605
world-famous bladesmith
Jason Knight,

01:11.639 --> 01:15.443
historic weapons recreation
specialist David Baker,

01:15.476 --> 01:19.280
and edged weapons specialist
Doug Marcaida.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.182
I'm sure that before
you came to this forge,

01:21.215 --> 01:24.252
you practiced making a signature
blade in your signature style,

01:24.285 --> 01:26.154
but that's not what
we're gonna be doing today.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.222
*

01:28.256 --> 01:31.692
On your anvils in front of you
is a piece of W1 steel.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.127
Your first round challenge

01:33.161 --> 01:34.762
is to use that steel to forge

01:34.795 --> 01:36.297
the kind of knife Jason Knight

01:36.330 --> 01:37.265
is known for...

01:37.298 --> 01:39.133
*

01:39.167 --> 01:41.635
The famous kukri.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.738
- I get an instant knot
in my stomach.

01:44.772 --> 01:48.409
- This is one of the hardest
blades I've ever made.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.611
- Oh, my.
- So one of your challenges

01:50.644 --> 01:53.181
is the edge geometry
on this knife.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.682
There's certain places
where it's thicker

01:54.715 --> 01:57.818
and certain places
where it's a lot thinner.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.620
Let's see what you can do.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.689
- The width of your blade
at the base

02:01.722 --> 02:04.392
must be at least 1 1/4 inch,

02:04.425 --> 02:05.759
and at the swell in the blade,

02:05.793 --> 02:08.162
it must be at least
2 1/2 inches.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.597
Keep in mind that in round two,

02:09.630 --> 02:10.864
you'll be putting handles
on your blades

02:10.898 --> 02:12.566
to turn them into
fully functional weapons

02:12.600 --> 02:14.168
that will then be tested
for strength

02:14.202 --> 02:16.637
and durability in a tree chop,

02:16.670 --> 02:19.907
and for edge retention
in a two-inch rope slice.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.775
Keep in mind
that when the time runs out,

02:21.809 --> 02:24.445
and the judges
have evaluated your work,

02:24.478 --> 02:26.614
one of you will have
to surrender your blade

02:26.647 --> 02:29.683
and leave the Forge.
Good luck, bladesmiths.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.420
Your ten-minute design
window starts now.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.288
*

02:34.322 --> 02:36.557
This is a difficult challenge.
- Yes.

02:36.590 --> 02:40.494
- Gonna have to adapt
their skills to make this blade.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.563
- The hardest thing about
the kukri is

02:42.596 --> 02:44.598
when you are making
this transition

02:44.632 --> 02:45.866
between skinny to thick,

02:45.899 --> 02:47.668
it becomes kind of tricky.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.239
Most bladesmiths have to
figure out how to do it.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.542
- Usually, you're working
towards a point on most knives,

02:54.575 --> 02:57.478
and you taper off
as you go towards the point.

02:57.511 --> 03:01.782
With a kukri, you gain metal
as you go out towards the point.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.851
You have to almost
put your mind in reverse

03:03.884 --> 03:06.220
when you're forging it out.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.621
- I've worked under some of
the greatest masters

03:07.655 --> 03:08.956
in the martial arts.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.791
When it comes to facing
a competition,

03:10.824 --> 03:12.260
having that background

03:12.293 --> 03:14.595
puts you on a different level.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.964
I am not playing checkers.

03:16.997 --> 03:20.000
I'm playing chess
almost all the time.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.770
- We have to make a kukri out
of this giant chunk,

03:22.803 --> 03:26.674
soup-can-sized chunk,
of W1 steel.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.576
So, the obvious challenge is

03:28.609 --> 03:30.010
where you got
to hit the dimensions,

03:30.043 --> 03:31.812
and u got to hit
the dimensions

03:31.845 --> 03:33.681
with a downward curve.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.517
It has all this weird
geometry going on,

03:36.550 --> 03:39.253
and I got to build it.

03:39.287 --> 03:42.523
- I've made war hammers
and all kinds of blades,

03:42.556 --> 03:44.425
so I'm not too
worried about this.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.427
My only concern is
I haven't worked with W1,

03:46.460 --> 03:50.030
so I'm not sure what
the composition is exactly,

03:50.063 --> 03:54.268
so I just want to keep this
simple in designing this kukri.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.370
- Bladesmiths, your design
window is closed.

03:56.404 --> 03:59.440
Your three-hour forge
time starts...

03:59.473 --> 04:00.574
now.

04:00.608 --> 04:03.477
*

04:03.511 --> 04:05.379
- The hardest part of this knife

04:05.413 --> 04:09.517
is calculating
how much steel you need where.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.951
- You know, one of
the challenges

04:10.984 --> 04:13.020
is trying to build enough heat

04:13.053 --> 04:16.357
so that the metal will actually
move when you hit it.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.359
You've got a piece of metal
the size of a soup can,

04:18.392 --> 04:20.361
and it takes an awful long time
for the heat to travel

04:20.394 --> 04:22.330
from the outside to the inside.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.997
- Well, I think this has been
the biggest billet

04:24.031 --> 04:27.835
of steel we've given
any of our contestants.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.371
- I think some of my strengths
coming into the Forge

04:30.404 --> 04:32.606
are what I know
about metallurgy.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.842
Metal is something
I think about,

04:34.875 --> 04:36.910
I work out in my sleep.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.479
My wife says that I have

04:38.512 --> 04:41.515
an unnatural
relationship with metal.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.651
*

04:43.684 --> 04:45.386
- Larry is the first
one of our smiths

04:45.419 --> 04:47.921
to actually take steel
over to a machine.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.657
It just doesn't seem
like it's hot enough.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.559
- I wouldn't forge
that temperature.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.594
Everything goes fast, though,
when you have enough heat.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.764
- Trying to get a large block
of a tool steel up to heat

04:56.797 --> 04:59.467
to be able to move that
into a billet--it's a challenge.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.335
*

05:01.369 --> 05:05.639
- Man, you can just hear
that press squealing in agony.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.741
- Ahh!

05:07.775 --> 05:09.843
Brock's forge is hot.
Look at that.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.613
It's like a little dragon
spitting fire out.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.616
- So, the first thing I want
to do is draw this material out

05:15.649 --> 05:18.085
so I can start
to get my profile worked out.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.988
- Look at the difference
between Brock's steel

05:21.021 --> 05:22.856
and Larry's steel over here:

05:22.890 --> 05:25.393
cold, gray lump

05:25.426 --> 05:28.696
versus bright orange brilliance.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.398
- Yeah, one thing
with Brock: we know

05:30.431 --> 05:32.866
he's gonna have to do
something extraordinary,

05:32.900 --> 05:36.670
because he is making
a style statement.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.838
- When I forge, I immerse
myself

05:37.871 --> 05:39.773
fully in the way I dress.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.576
You're really getting in touch
with something historical.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.912
- And what do you suppose
is in that horn?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.146
That's a way to call for help?

05:46.179 --> 05:49.683
both: [imitating trumpet]

05:49.717 --> 05:52.019
*

05:52.052 --> 05:54.922
- I feel like bladesmithing
brings joy to me that

05:54.955 --> 05:57.425
a lot of other things haven't.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.859
When I was younger,

05:58.892 --> 06:02.696
I concentrated a lot
on material things,

06:02.730 --> 06:06.967
and then I lost
everything I had,

06:07.000 --> 06:11.004
including my wife, our house,
all of our land--everything.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.574
So I started fresh
with my old pickup

06:13.607 --> 06:15.976
and about $12 in my pocket.

06:16.009 --> 06:19.747
That's what's great about life,
is we can start over every day.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.583
*

06:22.616 --> 06:24.485
That's why I'm here.
[chuckles]

06:24.518 --> 06:27.521
*

06:27.555 --> 06:29.423
- Whoa!
- It kind of shocked me

06:29.457 --> 06:31.825
how hard the metal was
to forge.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.061
There's gonna be a lot
of wrestling with it,

06:34.094 --> 06:37.465
so I'm hoping
that I can outwrestle it.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.132
*

06:39.166 --> 06:41.201
- Page's blade has
quite a belly.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.771
- Which could lend itself nice
as a chopper.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.173
- But the balance
of that remains to be seen.

06:46.206 --> 06:50.778
- I'm working with this thing,
and it's ugly.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.481
But until I have more heat
out of this forge,

06:53.514 --> 06:56.149
I can't make the steel
do what I want,

06:56.183 --> 06:58.752
so I put some more firebrick
on top of the forge

06:58.786 --> 07:01.622
trying to insulate the forge
to keep my heat in.

07:01.655 --> 07:06.093
Never made a kukri, but making
a kukri out of a soup can,

07:06.126 --> 07:07.861
that's a whole 'nother
ball of wax.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.697
- [laughs]

07:09.730 --> 07:12.833
- 90 minutes has elapsed!
- Make it happen.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.469
- They're scaring me, man.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.937
- Brock is the only one
of our smiths

07:16.970 --> 07:19.139
who's not trying to work
the whole bar of steel.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.775
He's just working what he needs.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.478
- I need another 3/4
inches in the belly of my blade

07:24.512 --> 07:26.079
to reach the minimum,
so I--

07:26.113 --> 07:27.915
I've got to stretch it
out quite a bit.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.651
- [humming]

07:30.684 --> 07:32.219
He can swing a hammer, no doubt.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.187
- I need to get this to
the right parameters

07:34.221 --> 07:36.490
so I don't get eliminated
for something foolish.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.158
- You know what?
Brock's blade actually...

07:38.191 --> 07:40.227
both: Looks like a kukri.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.697
- That's 'cause he's got
the elven boots of knife-making.

07:43.731 --> 07:46.500
- Gosh, I know, man.
I got to get those.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.836
- Whoo!
I think I need to work it

07:48.869 --> 07:50.938
just a little bit more,
and I'll be done.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.806
- It's warm.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.576
I'm glad I didn't wear
my thermal, or a vest.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.779
- Larry has drawn out
his weapon.

07:58.812 --> 08:03.083
Now it's just a matter of trying
to find a kukri shape into it.

08:03.116 --> 08:06.520
*

08:06.554 --> 08:08.088
- Ooh! Look at that fan!

08:08.121 --> 08:10.824
- Don't you wish you had a fan?

08:10.858 --> 08:13.160
- What is that?
- [laughs]

08:13.193 --> 08:15.195
- There's a number of
fan weapons,

08:15.228 --> 08:18.298
because being able to attack

08:18.331 --> 08:20.568
with a fan
is a weapon of surprise.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.035
- That's cool.
- Got a fan?

08:22.069 --> 08:23.971
- My favorite part of the fan:
to be able

08:24.004 --> 08:26.874
to cool off
next to that 1,800-degree heat.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.308
[laughter]

08:28.341 --> 08:29.977
- I want that!

08:30.010 --> 08:31.879
*

08:31.912 --> 08:35.048
- So I get it to
the shape I want.

08:35.082 --> 08:39.086
I want to keep the spine
of the knife a little more soft

08:39.119 --> 08:41.822
so that if the knife is tested,

08:41.855 --> 08:44.257
it won't be
more out to break.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.727
- What's he doing
with the water?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.930
- So I need to do
a differential quench.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.064
- He's gonna quench
in that water?

08:51.098 --> 08:52.700
- In water?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.201
- This goes against
everything that you guys

08:54.234 --> 08:56.169
have taught me
about blade-making.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.640
- W1 can actually be quenched
in regular old water.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.809
- Should it?
- No, it shouldn't be

09:01.842 --> 09:04.578
unless you know exactly
what you're doing,

09:04.612 --> 09:06.246
and the success rate is...

09:06.279 --> 09:09.282
- Exponentially lower than
quenching in oil.

09:09.316 --> 09:12.152
- Yes. Let's just wait
and see what happens.

09:12.185 --> 09:15.656
- No, no, no, no.
- He just quenched in water.

09:15.689 --> 09:19.092
- What do you wind up with?
- Cracks!

09:19.126 --> 09:21.995
- Quenching in water is
something that I typically do.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.998
I'm used to it.
It's a comfort factor for me.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.601
I'm just hoping
that it works out.

09:27.635 --> 09:31.038
- You have just 30 minutes
remaining to finish your blades!

09:31.071 --> 09:33.874
- That clock is killing me.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.376
- Page--he's been banging
on the tip of that knife

09:36.409 --> 09:39.780
for quite a while,
and it's not changing.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.281
I mean, honestly,
he'd be better off

09:41.314 --> 09:43.083
letting that cool
and grinding it.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.785
- The thing looks like a turd.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.720
It's got lumps,
it's got wiggles,

09:46.754 --> 09:48.155
it's got warps.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.157
So I go over to the grinder

09:50.190 --> 09:53.393
and just start
hogging off metal.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.062
- Look.
- All right!

09:55.095 --> 09:56.830
- I hate to
do that much grinder work.

09:56.864 --> 10:00.067
I'm a guy who likes to forge
almost to finish,

10:00.100 --> 10:03.837
so this is killing me,
but it's triage.

10:03.871 --> 10:07.941
*

10:07.975 --> 10:09.677
- Larry does have a kukri shape,

10:09.710 --> 10:11.712
but that handle
is just very wide.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.915
- Larry has not contoured
his handle at all.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.316
- I've got a blade, it's
a kukri,

10:16.349 --> 10:17.785
it's the right parameters,

10:17.818 --> 10:19.687
but I have a square billet

10:19.720 --> 10:21.689
for the handle right now
without any shaping,

10:21.722 --> 10:25.693
and I also managed
to get the warp

10:25.726 --> 10:27.160
on the tang end of the blade.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.996
My brain's really spinning.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.865
I wish that the clock
could stop for just a moment.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.134
I've got to start shaping
the handle of my knife,

10:34.167 --> 10:37.004
but there's no way I can
give the judges a warped blade.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.872
If I do, they're gonna
send me home.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.140
- 20 minutes!

10:40.173 --> 10:42.242
*

10:42.275 --> 10:44.945
- As I'm working the knife

10:44.978 --> 10:47.280
and shaping it,
I'm constantly measuring,

10:47.314 --> 10:50.383
and I realize,
if I sharpen this knife,

10:50.417 --> 10:53.153
it's gonna put it
under my parameter.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.022
*

10:55.055 --> 10:57.090
Trying to figure
something out on it now.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.060
I find a piece of
extra W1 steel,

11:00.093 --> 11:03.897
and I weld it as a fin
on the spine of the knife.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.866
That gives me my 2 1/2 inches.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.234
When you make a mistake,

11:07.267 --> 11:09.937
you have to correct it some way,

11:09.970 --> 11:12.773
and just keep going forward
no matter what happens.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.441
*

11:14.474 --> 11:16.476
- Man, that looks great.
- I've got the belly of

11:16.509 --> 11:18.145
the blade pulled out,

11:18.178 --> 11:20.147
so I should be safe
on the parameters.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.082
- The only guy that really
showed up here

11:22.115 --> 11:24.985
with a to-win agenda is Brock.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.120
His work is backing up
that outfit.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.289
- He was dressed for success.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.724
- I'm coming up on my quench,

11:30.758 --> 11:32.793
and I've never worked
with W1,

11:32.826 --> 11:35.328
so I'm really starting
to get psyched out

11:35.362 --> 11:37.297
on how I need to deal
with this.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.499
I saw Terry quench it in water,

11:39.532 --> 11:41.468
and I'm thinking maybe
I should do the same.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.037
Excuse me. I'm gonna come
right here, if that's all right.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.072
- You're good.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.775
- And I never use water, so...

11:47.808 --> 11:49.777
[laughs]

11:49.810 --> 11:51.444
*

11:51.478 --> 11:52.379
- No, don't do it!
- No!

11:56.950 --> 11:58.151
- You're good.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.153
- I saw Terry quench it
in water,

12:00.187 --> 12:02.455
and I'm thinking maybe
I should do the same.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.257
*

12:04.291 --> 12:05.893
- No, don't do it!
- No!

12:05.926 --> 12:07.394
- What are you doing?
- All right--

12:07.427 --> 12:09.462
- Brock just did
an edge quench...

12:09.496 --> 12:11.832
- In water.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.801
That's pretty ballsy.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.103
*

12:16.136 --> 12:19.172
- I hear a nice "tink"
sound, which is not good.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.974
[bleep], [bleep],
[bleep].

12:21.008 --> 12:22.109
I'm starting to panic.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.476
It's cracked.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.545
[groans]

12:25.578 --> 12:27.247
All I can do at this point

12:27.280 --> 12:30.283
is clean it up some
and hope it's enough.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.385
This could be it.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.823
- I hope Brock saves
the princess in this episode.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.324
- [bleep].

12:37.357 --> 12:39.459
- There we go.
- Page is in the quench.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.995
- Oh, man, that thing was
bright red.

12:42.029 --> 12:45.799
- Yeah, that was a hot one.
- Holy smokes.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.901
- We got a quench
over there with Larry.

12:47.935 --> 12:53.040
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

12:53.073 --> 12:58.245
five, four, three, two, one.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.847
Bladesmiths, shut down
your machines.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.515
Your forging time is over.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.318
- I couldn't take the warp
out of the tang,

13:05.352 --> 13:08.388
I hope that's not gonna be
seen as something against me.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.590
- I'm really happy
with the profile and the shape,

13:10.623 --> 13:15.362
but I really regret
quenching it in water.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.164
- In the first round
of this competition,

13:17.197 --> 13:19.299
you were given a solid
piece of W1 steel

13:19.332 --> 13:21.902
from which to forge a kukri.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.336
Let's see how you did.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.973
Larry, you're up first.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.340
- You were having a lot
of problem

13:27.374 --> 13:29.309
getting that steel to move.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.245
Now, I'm not identifying
any major cracks in this blade,

13:32.279 --> 13:33.513
but some of that
might have to do

13:33.546 --> 13:36.483
with how much material
is still here.

13:36.516 --> 13:40.453
- Your weapon right now looks
like a curved flat-stock steel.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.222
There's no flare
to your handle.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.858
It's pretty much all the same
all the way there.

13:44.892 --> 13:48.528
That, sir,
is very uncomfortable.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.298
- Brock, you're up next.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.166
- What I like: you did 90%

13:53.200 --> 13:55.202
of this work with the hammer.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.504
But pretty major cracks
that I can see.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.572
*

13:59.606 --> 14:02.009
What made you decide
to quench the blade in water?

14:02.042 --> 14:03.443
- 'Cause I hadn't worked
with W1,

14:03.476 --> 14:05.879
so I took a risk
that I shouldn't have.

14:05.913 --> 14:08.181
- Your blade has some
serious flaws in it.

14:08.215 --> 14:12.085
I don't know if you can
fix these flaws.

14:12.119 --> 14:14.587
- Terry.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.323
- Your blade kind
of looks like a kukri,

14:16.356 --> 14:17.624
but the difference
with a kukri is,

14:17.657 --> 14:19.326
when you hold it on the grip,

14:19.359 --> 14:22.129
it's already got that
forward sweep to it.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.164
With your blade,
it's very straightforward,

14:24.197 --> 14:27.234
but your handle feels good.

14:27.267 --> 14:30.303
- So you also quenched in water.
- Yes.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.907
- You have some quench cracks--
at least three that I can see.

14:33.941 --> 14:37.444
Water is a dangerous medium
to quench in.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.247
- Page, you're up.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.249
- Page, I know how hard

14:42.282 --> 14:44.051
it is to make this knife.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.988
You're closer to being
a kukri shape.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.523
You have some edge
geometry going on here,

14:50.557 --> 14:52.059
and I appreciate that.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.995
- Thank you.
- All right, gentlemen.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.330
The judges will need to take
a closer look at your work.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.465
Thank you.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.301
*

15:01.334 --> 15:04.004
- That was harsh.
- Dude.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.272
- All right, judges.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.439
So is there a blade
on this table

15:06.473 --> 15:08.541
that is
absolutely moving forward?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.677
- Page.
- This is a blade that

15:10.710 --> 15:14.381
can be refined into something
that will be effective.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.517
- Let's move on
to Larry's blade right here.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.987
- Although he did meet
the parameters,

15:20.020 --> 15:23.056
this is the least knife
of all four of these.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.192
There's no shape to it.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.394
- There's a huge warp
in this blade.

15:27.427 --> 15:31.164
I think the forge skills
on this blade are lacking.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.565
*

15:32.599 --> 15:35.068
- Let's move on
to Brock's blade.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.469
- He's got a kukri shape there.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.438
He's got a nice handle,

15:38.471 --> 15:41.641
but there are major
cracks visible in this blade.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.344
There are ways
to take care of this,

15:44.377 --> 15:46.713
mainly because there's enough
material here to do it.

15:46.746 --> 15:50.750
- But if we were to test this
at this stage,

15:50.783 --> 15:52.519
I wouldn't be able to.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.587
- I don't know.
It's anybody's game.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.389
- Why don't you go ahead
and pick up Terry's blade?

15:56.423 --> 15:59.092
What do you think
of that there, Dave?

15:59.126 --> 16:01.661
- You know, Terry got a
good shape going in the handle,

16:01.694 --> 16:04.431
but, you know, when I look
at it, I don't see a kukri.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.699
- It's a design,
but the problems with this blade

16:06.733 --> 16:09.302
are all the cracks
that he has in this,

16:09.336 --> 16:12.005
and it's thin.
- All right, gentlemen.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.573
Have you made a final decision?

16:13.606 --> 16:16.076
- Yeah, man.
- Let's go tell our smiths.

16:16.109 --> 16:21.481
*

16:21.514 --> 16:25.185
Bladesmiths, it's time for one
of you to leave the Forge.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.088
*

16:28.121 --> 16:32.025
Terry, your blade did
not make the cut.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.793
- Terry, you started out
with more than enough metal

16:33.826 --> 16:35.495
to make that knife,

16:35.528 --> 16:37.564
but now that blade's
extremely thin.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.199
It's got three cracks that run

16:39.232 --> 16:41.134
almost all the way
to the spine,

16:41.168 --> 16:43.270
and there's really not enough
metal there to forge

16:43.303 --> 16:45.238
or grind out those cracks,

16:45.272 --> 16:47.707
and that's the reason
we're sending you home.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.342
- I understand.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.577
- Terry, please surrender
your weapon.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.280
*

16:53.313 --> 16:55.715
- I've been tested a lot harder
an that in my life,

16:55.748 --> 16:57.784
so even though I'm going home,

16:57.817 --> 16:59.786
this is gonna make me
a better bladesmith,

16:59.819 --> 17:02.255
so I'm gonna take that knowledge

17:02.289 --> 17:05.192
that I learned
for those three hard hours,

17:05.225 --> 17:07.660
and I'm gonna use it
for the rest of my life.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.596
*

17:09.629 --> 17:11.798
- Bladesmiths, now it's time
for the second round.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.566
Of course, in this round
of competition,

17:13.600 --> 17:15.268
you'll be attaching handles
to your blades

17:15.302 --> 17:17.204
to turn them into
fully functional weapons

17:17.237 --> 17:18.638
that will then be tested
for strength

17:18.671 --> 17:21.574
and durability in a tree chop,

17:21.608 --> 17:25.712
and for edge retention
in a two-inch rope slice.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.547
You will have three hours
in this round.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.816
I highly suggest
you address the flaws

17:29.849 --> 17:31.784
that have been identified
in your blades.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.287
- Right.
- Good luck, gentlemen.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.623
Your time starts now.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.458
*

17:38.491 --> 17:40.393
Who do you think has
the most work to do right now?

17:40.427 --> 17:42.829
- Brock has three major cracks
in that blade.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.165
He can grind a lot
of that material away.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.400
- Man. The first thing I have
to deal with

17:47.434 --> 17:49.336
is the stress fractures.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.439
I instantly go to the grinder
to see how deep these are.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.441
Whoo!

17:54.474 --> 17:56.309
I have a couple of ideas to deal
with these stress fractures,

17:56.343 --> 17:58.745
one being just bringing
this blade in more.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.848
If I don't eliminate the
stress fractures in this blade,

18:01.881 --> 18:05.652
I'll be eliminated
in the next round easily enough.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.588
- Brock is on his merry way
in developing his blade.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.623
- [laughing]

18:10.657 --> 18:13.126
- Larry's gonna try to
straighten that blade right now.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.694
- I've got to fix the warp,

18:14.727 --> 18:16.596
and then I've got to start
making the handle.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.898
The first thing I do is heat up
the tang of the knife.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.633
The goal of this is to make sure

18:20.667 --> 18:23.136
it's soft enough
to try to move the metal

18:23.170 --> 18:24.904
and take the warp
out of the tang

18:24.937 --> 18:26.906
without cracking my knife.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.441
- That fire's nowhere hot enough

18:28.475 --> 18:30.643
to make that
metal hot enough to move it.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.212
You need to get that flame--

18:32.245 --> 18:34.247
- Like a little feather.
- Exactly.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.416
- He's gonna make a smokescreen
and switch out the blade.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.152
- That's right. That's right.

18:39.186 --> 18:42.889
- My triage order
is handle, fatness, edge.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.492
Handle first. You know,
that's kind of a no-brainer.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.795
I'm gonna start shaping
my tang so it'll work.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.731
A weapon's no good if you can't
put it in someone's hand.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.334
I'm trying to make this
as flat as I can

18:54.367 --> 18:56.436
so I've got a good
bedding surface

18:56.469 --> 18:59.706
for this handle material
to bed against.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.175
And then I probably
got half a pound of steel

19:02.209 --> 19:03.810
that's got to come off
of this thing.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.512
I got a long road ahead of me.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.647
*

19:07.680 --> 19:09.349
- I think I've dealt
with all my cracks.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.584
I don't see any visible
fractures on the edge.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.320
I'll have to find some material

19:13.353 --> 19:14.787
to make sure
I have my parameters,

19:14.821 --> 19:16.956
'cause I'm probably off
by just a little bit.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.525
Will you look at that?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.860
- Brock is actually welding
a piece of steel

19:20.893 --> 19:23.596
onto the back edge of the blade.

19:23.630 --> 19:27.267
He's trying to put more mass
back into it.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.969
- No matter what happens,
I like Brock. I like his outfit,

19:30.002 --> 19:32.472
and I wish I could figure out
what he's doing with that horn.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.375
- Brock, what's in that horn?

19:35.408 --> 19:36.409
*

19:36.443 --> 19:38.645
[laughter]

19:38.678 --> 19:40.813
- The shape of the tang
is close enough.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.482
Got to get a handle on it.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.984
Everything here is just
a little bit undersized.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.388
If I want to get thickness,
I'm gonna have to go with this

19:48.421 --> 19:50.890
Rag Micarta, and I hate
Rag Micarta.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.560
I don't like looking at it,
I don't like feeling it,

19:53.593 --> 19:55.495
but it's sitting there,
just saying,

19:55.528 --> 19:56.996
"You know you need me.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.831
"I'm the last one in the bar.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.900
Take me home."
Screw it and move on.

20:00.933 --> 20:04.737
- Bladesmiths!
90 minutes has elapsed!

20:04.771 --> 20:06.606
- I'm about to switch gears.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.709
I wasn't able to take the warp
out completely

20:09.742 --> 20:12.245
without taking a risk
of breaking the blade.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.447
You know, it's gonna have to be
good enough at this point.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.982
I know the judges didn't have
the greatest feedback

20:16.015 --> 20:18.318
about my block handle,
and when it comes down to it,

20:18.351 --> 20:20.820
I didn't have enough time, and
so now I've got to make up

20:20.853 --> 20:23.456
the time I lost in the first
round, drill the holes,

20:23.490 --> 20:24.957
find the handle material,

20:24.991 --> 20:27.360
start gluing the handle
material together.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.795
My goal is to get it assembled,

20:28.828 --> 20:30.830
and then I have to hit
the grinder again.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.965
You can't use a weapon
if you can't hold on to it.

20:32.999 --> 20:38.538
- Bladesmiths, you have just
30 minutes remaining!

20:38.571 --> 20:41.874
Seeing handles on two
of our blades.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.511
Brock's starting to move
a little bit frantically.

20:44.544 --> 20:47.314
Not only does he have
to get his handle material

20:47.347 --> 20:49.316
fitted to his tang, he's also

20:49.349 --> 20:50.983
got to shape it
into a comfortable handle.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.051
- I've got to get this
together.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.586
I'm running out of time.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.921
So priority number one
on this handle

20:54.954 --> 20:56.589
is getting it done quickly.

20:56.623 --> 20:57.990
I've grabbed some material
that's not

20:58.024 --> 20:59.659
particularly beautiful,
but I think it'll work.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.329
[groans]
It's not going too well.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.631
- He's wrestling
with something over there.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.699
- I'm trying to get my pins
to fit, and I realize

21:06.733 --> 21:09.802
I have one of my
handle scales backwards.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.838
Okay.
- You know, at this point,

21:11.871 --> 21:14.807
even if Brock just got two pins
all the way through both scales

21:14.841 --> 21:16.576
and filled the rest with glue,

21:16.609 --> 21:19.078
at least we'd have
something to test.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.847
- I'm starting to panic.

21:20.880 --> 21:21.981
If don't get
this handle together,

21:22.014 --> 21:23.049
they won't be able to test it,

21:23.082 --> 21:24.651
and I'm going home.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.285
Ah!

21:29.422 --> 21:30.890
- I've only got about
20 minutes left,

21:30.923 --> 21:33.493
and I have one of
my handle scales on backwards.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.628
- I think Brock better get
busy, bizzo.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.597
- Ahh!
- Even if Brock just got

21:37.630 --> 21:39.899
two pins all the way
through both scales,

21:39.932 --> 21:41.368
at least we'd have
something to test.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.035
- I'm really pressed for time,

21:43.069 --> 21:44.971
so I really have to work fast
to shape this handle.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.607
- Brock needs to get gluing.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.342
- I'm right on schedule.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.777
I've started profiling

21:50.810 --> 21:53.079
the handle so it's got
a better grip.

21:53.112 --> 21:56.683
- Larry's actually adding a lot
of shape to the handle, man.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.751
- His scale is still hinge.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.853
- I think it's coming along
great, but I got a big hand,

22:00.887 --> 22:03.556
so I got to compensate
for other people.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.025
*

22:06.058 --> 22:07.827
- The handle feels good.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.729
It doesn't want to rotate
weirdly in my hands

22:09.762 --> 22:11.931
when I'm flipping it around,
so I'm moving on.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.700
The clock is really
running down,

22:13.733 --> 22:15.935
and there's way
too much meat on it.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.704
I've got to grind it down.

22:17.737 --> 22:20.773
I want to have something
that's actually sharp.

22:20.807 --> 22:23.810
- It's really not a bad shape,
but it's crude.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.713
He needs to basically
fine tune his blade.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.881
- I'm just grinding,
and grinding it.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.751
Grind, grind, grind.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.085
I'm nowhere near an edge,

22:33.119 --> 22:35.054
and the clock
is just running away.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.155
*

22:36.188 --> 22:37.724
- Ten, nine,

22:37.757 --> 22:40.793
eight, seven, six,

22:40.827 --> 22:42.762
five, four,

22:42.795 --> 22:46.032
three, two, one.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.567
Bladesmiths, shut down
your machines.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.503
Return to your anvils.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.072
- I'm looking at my blade,
and it's not as sharp

22:53.105 --> 22:55.508
as I want it to be,
but at least I've got a handle.

22:55.542 --> 22:58.144
I'm really wishing I just had
five more minutes.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.179
Whoo!

23:00.212 --> 23:02.081
- Brock's got
a decent-looking blade.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.683
I don't know if he dealt
with his cracks,

23:03.716 --> 23:06.085
but if he did,
then I'm in trouble.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.153
*

23:07.186 --> 23:09.556
- This is the strength test.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.758
I'll be testing the strength
and durability of your edges

23:11.791 --> 23:14.861
by chopping into
these trees three times.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.597
This is not about what
your blades do to these trees.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.566
It's about what the trees do
to your blades.

23:19.599 --> 23:20.933
- A palm tree's not easy

23:20.967 --> 23:22.502
to chop through
on the best of days.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.537
It's designed to roll an edge.

23:24.571 --> 23:27.039
- Larry, you ready?
- Always ready.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.741
And that's why I made an edge

23:28.775 --> 23:30.142
that would be able
to handle a problem

23:30.176 --> 23:31.778
like these palm trees.

23:31.811 --> 23:38.751
*

23:41.621 --> 23:44.190
- Very difficult to hold
on to this knife.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.058
I just don't have good leverage.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.927
There is no edge damage.

23:47.960 --> 23:51.498
Oh, wait a minute. There is edge
damage right there.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.199
It doesn't surprise me.

23:53.232 --> 23:56.135
You still have essentially
a flat bar of steel,

23:56.168 --> 23:58.871
and the edge is only right here.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.473
- That's a little shocking
to me,

24:00.507 --> 24:02.241
but all I can do is give it
to the gods

24:02.274 --> 24:04.644
and see what happens.

24:04.677 --> 24:07.647
- All right, Brock, you ready?
- Yep.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.549
I'm pretty sure that
I got all the cracks out,

24:09.582 --> 24:12.184
but if I didn't, it could be
a fatal flaw in this testing.

24:12.218 --> 24:19.158
*

24:22.562 --> 24:24.864
- Brock, I like the way
you got rid of the cracks.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.899
I'm impressed that you were able
to pull that off.

24:26.933 --> 24:29.536
It's thin enough to cut,
it's sharp,

24:29.569 --> 24:31.538
we didn't get
any edge deformation here.

24:31.571 --> 24:32.539
Well done.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.140
*

24:34.173 --> 24:35.174
Page, you ready?

24:35.207 --> 24:37.577
- I kind of got to be.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.612
I'm feeling
all sorts of nervous,

24:39.646 --> 24:41.213
'cause I didn't have time

24:41.247 --> 24:44.116
to put what I conser
a good edge on the blade.

24:44.150 --> 24:52.091
*

24:52.124 --> 24:55.562
- Well, Page, your handle
is comfortable,

24:55.595 --> 24:58.064
but it's a little round here.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.166
It makes it a little
more difficult to control.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.069
However, your blade cut
deeply into the wood,

25:03.102 --> 25:06.172
and your edge
has no damage to it.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.040
Well done.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.109
- I'm doing good,
but there's still a rope.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.579
- Next up is the sharpness test,
and for that,

25:12.612 --> 25:13.980
I'll be turning you
over to Doug.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.982
- To test the edge retention
of your weapon,

25:16.015 --> 25:17.817
I will try to cut through this
two-inch rope

25:17.850 --> 25:20.587
by slashing it up
to three times.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.822
- Seeing my blade in Doug's
hand makes me happy.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.156
He's a fellow martial artist,

25:24.190 --> 25:27.627
and I was kind of waiting
for that moment.

25:27.660 --> 25:35.167
*

25:35.201 --> 25:36.703
Huah!

25:36.736 --> 25:38.638
Hell, yeah.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.573
- You definitely
have a beast here,

25:40.607 --> 25:43.275
making it even harder
to control on the recovery.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.745
Power without control
is useless,

25:45.778 --> 25:48.715
but your blade will cut.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.282
- Thank you.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.218
- Brock, you're next. Ready?

25:52.251 --> 25:54.220
- I'm a bit nervous
at this point,

25:54.253 --> 25:57.056
because my edge is probably not
as refined as my competitors'.

25:57.089 --> 26:04.063
*

26:08.735 --> 26:11.838
- Brock, what I like about
the feel of your handle

26:11.871 --> 26:13.172
is that it's easy to index

26:13.205 --> 26:15.341
and know where exactly
the cutting edge is.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.744
Remember, it's not about cutting
all the way through the rope,

26:17.777 --> 26:20.012
but it's also about the edge
retention of your weapon.

26:20.046 --> 26:22.615
It's not very refined,
but overall,

26:22.649 --> 26:24.250
it's got a good feel to it.

26:24.283 --> 26:27.019
Your blade will cut.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.187
Page, your turn. You ready?

26:28.220 --> 26:30.089
- Yes, sir.

26:30.122 --> 26:37.029
*

26:39.198 --> 26:42.134
- Well, Page, your handle feels
comfortable in the hand.

26:42.168 --> 26:44.370
Your blade is actually
light and balanced,

26:44.403 --> 26:46.038
so it's easy on the recovery.

26:46.072 --> 26:49.041
Your blade is sharp
enough to cut.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.243
Good job.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.112
- We all hit a wall
in the first round.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.247
We all had to recover
in the second round.

26:55.281 --> 26:59.418
I think it's a tight race.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.722
- Bladesmiths, it's time for one
of you to leave the Forge.

27:02.755 --> 27:05.692
[dramatic music]

27:05.725 --> 27:08.094
Larry, your blade did
not make the cut.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.696
*

27:09.729 --> 27:11.898
- Larry, your handle is
very large,

27:11.931 --> 27:14.200
and it made for
an unwieldy feel

27:14.233 --> 27:16.202
while using your blade,

27:16.235 --> 27:18.337
but in the end, your blade was
the only one that developed

27:18.370 --> 27:20.907
any kind of edge damage.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.274
That's why we're letting you go.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.210
*

27:24.243 --> 27:27.747
- Well, Larry,
please surrender your weapon.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.749
- I feel it was
an extremely close competition.

27:29.782 --> 27:32.919
I made a beast of a blade
for a Viking of a person.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.687
I definitely achieved the goal
of putting myself out there

27:34.721 --> 27:35.922
and challenging myself.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.090
Life without challenge
is boring.

27:38.124 --> 27:41.994
If we don't rise up and meet
life, then we're not living.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.996
*

27:44.030 --> 27:46.065
- Brock, Page, congratulations.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.134
You're both one step
closer to the title

27:48.167 --> 27:49.836
of "Forged in Fire" champion

27:49.869 --> 27:51.938
and a check for $10,000.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.472
All you have to do now
is go home

27:53.505 --> 27:56.442
and reproduce an iconic
weapon from history.

27:56.475 --> 27:57.910
That weapon is...

27:57.944 --> 27:59.712
*

27:59.746 --> 28:00.980
The akrafena.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.414
*

28:02.448 --> 28:04.817
- Kind of scared of it.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.853
- The akrafena is
a distinctive sword

28:06.886 --> 28:09.121
hailing from the Ashanti
kingdom of West Africa

28:09.155 --> 28:11.290
around the 10th century A.D.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.359
Initially used as
a weapon of warfare,

28:13.392 --> 28:16.462
Ashanti warriors brandished
the sword in one or both hands

28:16.495 --> 28:19.298
to deliver heavy strikes
in close-quarters combat.

28:19.331 --> 28:22.001
The sword's curved blade
and dumbbell-shaped hilt

28:22.034 --> 28:24.503
were embedded with symbolic
designs known as adinkra,

28:24.536 --> 28:26.739
evoking Ashanti principles

28:26.773 --> 28:29.108
like courage, valor,
or heroism.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.277
Today, the akrafena
is the national symbol

28:31.310 --> 28:33.112
of the modern-day
Ashanti city-state,

28:33.145 --> 28:35.047
carried by the king's
royal emissaries

28:35.081 --> 28:37.083
at prestigious ceremonies.

28:37.116 --> 28:40.019
Your weapon must come
to a flared tip

28:40.052 --> 28:43.122
and have at least
two cutouts in the blade.

28:43.155 --> 28:45.858
Additionally, the handle
must be rounded

28:45.892 --> 28:49.261
at both the top and the bottom.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.964
You will have five days
at your home forge to do this.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.766
At the end of five days,

28:53.800 --> 28:55.367
you will return and present
your finished akrafenas

28:55.401 --> 28:57.403
to our panel of expert judges.

28:57.436 --> 29:01.040
Good luck, bladesmiths.
We'll see you in five days.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.942
- Right on.
- Let's do it.

29:02.975 --> 29:05.444
*

29:05.477 --> 29:07.213
- I'm back in my home forge.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.481
I did a CAD draft.
She's ugly.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.918
Almost all of
the historic examples

29:11.951 --> 29:13.119
have a hook on the end of them.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.520
The blade is pierced.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.555
It really kind of looks
like a pancake turner.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.257
Get it hot, hit it hard.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.926
*

29:19.959 --> 29:23.462
What concerns me greatly
is Brock pulled off

29:23.495 --> 29:25.531
the most amazing
comeback that I've seen yet.

29:25.564 --> 29:29.068
He literally went from a cracked
blade to the final round,

29:29.101 --> 29:31.203
and now I have to
deal with him as an opponent.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.873
My shoulder's gonna hurt
a little bit tomorrow.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.441
It's a really broad blade,

29:35.474 --> 29:36.943
which means in order to make it

29:36.976 --> 29:39.378
so that it's actually
a usable weapon,

29:39.411 --> 29:41.513
I'm gonna have
to make it really thin.

29:41.547 --> 29:42.949
A lot of effort
to try to make it

29:42.982 --> 29:44.416
do what you want to do.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.952
[clanging]

29:45.985 --> 29:47.586
I'm looking at this blade.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.255
It's gonna be thin.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.958
I ended up losing mass
on the edge to the point

29:51.991 --> 29:54.593
where the edge was compromised.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.295
If this is too thin,

29:56.328 --> 29:58.564
it will crack
in the judges' hands.

29:58.597 --> 30:01.934
Time to reassess
and try doing another blade.

30:01.968 --> 30:06.072
*

30:06.105 --> 30:07.606
- We're back at my home forge.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.876
Let's make some blades.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.277
It looks like we're getting
some thunderstorms,

30:11.310 --> 30:13.612
so I think Thor is
favoring me today.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.314
All right, all right.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.449
The akrafena was often
made from iron,

30:17.483 --> 30:19.418
so it's very easy to work.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.020
I don't have to worry
about annealing it.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.989
It's not gonna harden
in that way.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.891
Put some fresh coal here.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.425
I'm a lot more comfortable
in a coal forge.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.060
It's what I'm used
to working with.

30:28.094 --> 30:31.097
You got to get this up to forge
welding heat.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.564
In order to create a blade

30:32.598 --> 30:34.066
that will have
a very strong edge

30:34.100 --> 30:36.502
but still be mostly iron,
I'll have to use

30:36.535 --> 30:38.971
a san mai construction,
folding the iron

30:39.005 --> 30:43.142
onto a high-carbon steel
and create a layered billet.

30:43.175 --> 30:47.479
But as I'm shaping this blade,
I notice an issue.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.281
Got stress cracks.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.983
Probably because of going back

30:51.017 --> 30:52.952
and forth between thinning
and shaping.

30:52.985 --> 30:56.455
If those get too severe
or too deep, I'm in trouble.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.557
- Day three.
I had a bit of a setback.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.093
I couldn't go forward with
the blade I'd been working on,

31:01.127 --> 31:04.196
so I scabbed together
a bunch of bars of metal

31:04.230 --> 31:06.966
into one and
forge welded them together.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.568
Not seeing anything that makes
me more nervous than before.

31:09.601 --> 31:13.973
So today, I am getting ready
to cut out the diamond shapes.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.008
I was gonna try
to cut something fancy,

31:16.042 --> 31:18.644
but I don't have time.
Time is precious.

31:18.677 --> 31:21.247
A diamond symbol
means "precious."

31:21.280 --> 31:24.616
Now I figure out how to wire up
my heat treating oven.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.552
Heat treating a blade is a very

31:26.585 --> 31:28.620
stressful process
for the steel.

31:28.654 --> 31:32.558
With the number of forge welds
involved in this blade,

31:32.591 --> 31:34.060
there's a real possibility

31:34.093 --> 31:36.628
that this blade
could just peel apart.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.698
*

31:39.731 --> 31:41.934
I didn't feel any bad noises.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.402
*

31:43.435 --> 31:45.537
It's still a blade.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.506
I think I might actually be able
to finish this thing.

31:47.539 --> 31:51.643
*

31:51.677 --> 31:53.379
- Doing some blade surgery
this morning.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.982
It's day three.
It's a very pivotal day.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.650
It's okay, little blade.
It's gonna be all right.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.187
Those cracks
were only surface deep.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.290
I don't believe they're going
to affect my blade's integrity,

32:04.323 --> 32:07.059
and it's just something I'll
have to deal with via hammering.

32:07.093 --> 32:07.994
That went pretty well.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.162
*

32:10.196 --> 32:12.664
I'm gonna put some symbols
on the surface of the blade.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.466
I've really been drawn
more to the ones

32:14.500 --> 32:16.268
with the diamond shape in them.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.670
Looking good.
I really need to heat treat.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.973
The sooner I heat treat,
the sooner I find out

32:21.007 --> 32:23.142
if this blade really
is ready to go.

32:23.175 --> 32:26.078
*

32:26.112 --> 32:28.014
Whoo, that feels aggressive.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.648
But if anything goes wrong
with the heat treat,

32:29.681 --> 32:32.284
I will have to abandon it
if I can't fix the problem.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.520
*

32:34.553 --> 32:37.256
Got a real severe warp.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.225
Messed that all the hell up.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.693
There's no way this thing
can be tested like this.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.096
I really need to get
that warp out.

32:44.130 --> 32:47.466
I really don't want to be
beating on this thing too much.

32:47.499 --> 32:50.102
I have to really be careful
with how I hammer this.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.371
If it cracks, that would be it.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.077
- Day four. This blade's got
a whole lot of ugly going on,

32:58.110 --> 33:00.512
so it's kind of necessary
to take that off.

33:00.546 --> 33:04.216
Today, I've got to make it
pretty, finish the handle,

33:04.250 --> 33:06.585
and decorate the handle,
if there's time.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.355
The major hurdles of the blade
are finally behind me,

33:09.388 --> 33:11.323
I think, unless I discover

33:11.357 --> 33:14.393
something completely
unexpected.

33:14.426 --> 33:15.494
No.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.363
*

33:17.396 --> 33:20.732
Got one delamination
I don't like right there.

33:20.766 --> 33:24.370
This might come back
to bite me,

33:24.403 --> 33:27.273
but I can't spend time
chasing problems.

33:27.306 --> 33:29.041
I need to move on.

33:29.075 --> 33:31.410
I'm not gonna grind
any more on that spot.

33:31.443 --> 33:34.680
So my plan for the handle
is to take this really

33:34.713 --> 33:36.648
nice-looking African wood

33:36.682 --> 33:38.450
and turn the handle
on the lathe.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.219
You just spin it,
cut off whatever

33:40.252 --> 33:43.089
doesn't look like
your finished piece.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.424
All right.
I want to test it.

33:45.457 --> 33:49.128
*

33:49.161 --> 33:50.796
It works.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.499
I am about to attempt
doing gold leaf.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.535
It's gonna take about 30 minutes
for this sticky stuff

33:56.568 --> 33:58.670
to be ready for leafing.

33:58.704 --> 34:01.073
It looks like
the historical ones.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.075
I built a weapon.

34:03.109 --> 34:06.545
This is the first time I really
feel confident that I can win.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.347
- Day four, I needed to
straighten

34:08.380 --> 34:09.815
the blade toward the tang,

34:09.848 --> 34:12.251
so I hammered that
a little bit.

34:12.284 --> 34:13.785
That's nice and straight.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.754
So I finally got
my akrafena straightened,

34:15.787 --> 34:18.690
but before I can really know
if this thing's going through,

34:18.724 --> 34:20.426
I need to test it.

34:20.459 --> 34:23.862
All right, so let's take
a few light swings.

34:23.895 --> 34:27.599
*

34:27.633 --> 34:29.535
Let's do some harder swings.

34:29.568 --> 34:33.572
*

34:33.605 --> 34:35.574
I don't see the judges
hitting it any harder than that.

34:35.607 --> 34:38.110
Let me get on shaping this.

34:38.144 --> 34:39.645
I'm gonna start working
on my handle,

34:39.678 --> 34:41.880
and I'm using
an African wood, tamarind.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.650
I think it'll suit
this akrafena well.

34:44.683 --> 34:47.286
That's what we're looking for.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.121
I chose to incorporate
some symbols

34:49.155 --> 34:52.724
on the handle--humility,
and strength, endurance.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.793
All of those elements
are in this blade,

34:54.826 --> 34:56.228
and I'm very proud of it.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.763
It's gon' kill.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.566
Time for judgment, Page!

35:00.599 --> 35:03.835
*

35:03.869 --> 35:05.437
- Bladesmiths, welcome back.

35:05.471 --> 35:06.905
You've had five days
at your home forge

35:06.938 --> 35:09.608
to work on your akrafenas.

35:09.641 --> 35:10.842
Brock, how did it go?

35:10.876 --> 35:12.611
- Pretty well.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.346
I chose to do a san mai
construction

35:14.380 --> 35:16.615
with iron and 1095,
and I'm trying

35:16.648 --> 35:18.350
to stick with
a more authentic look.

35:18.384 --> 35:20.319
I think it'll hold up well.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.688
- Page, how'd it go for you?
- I ran into some issues,

35:22.721 --> 35:24.323
but I pushed through it.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.858
I built my weapon
to cut deeply,

35:26.892 --> 35:29.795
and went after the historic
profile of the weapon,

35:29.828 --> 35:32.231
and I hope it works.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.433
- Well, now it's time
for the weapons test.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.336
Up first, the kill test. Doug?

35:37.369 --> 35:39.571
*

35:39.605 --> 35:41.707
- Bladesmiths, the akrafena
was a weapon

35:41.740 --> 35:44.910
used by the king's emissaries
to dispatch their enemies.

35:44.943 --> 35:47.879
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon can do,

35:47.913 --> 35:50.782
I will deliver killing blows
on this lamb carcass.

35:50.816 --> 35:54.553
- They look awful
huge for lambs.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.322
- Brock, you're up first.
You ready?

35:56.355 --> 35:58.190
- Yeah. Let's see what she does.

35:58.224 --> 36:00.826
So going into the final round,
I'm really excited.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.595
I've had a lot of time to really
get my mind set for this.

36:03.629 --> 36:06.265
I know my edge will hold.

36:06.298 --> 36:13.205
*

36:14.340 --> 36:16.242
Ah, [bleep].

36:16.275 --> 36:20.312
- Well, Brock, your sword bent.

36:20.346 --> 36:21.613
- Tight around corners now.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.982
- But blades bend in combat.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.884
- It's reassuring
to hear him say that, you know,

36:25.917 --> 36:28.387
"Oh, well,
blades bend in battle."

36:28.420 --> 36:29.888
It gives me some reassurance
that, you know,

36:29.921 --> 36:31.323
I'm not just out of the game.

36:31.357 --> 36:33.259
- It's got a nice feel to it.

36:33.292 --> 36:36.262
I don't see any visible chips
on the edge.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.764
Overall, your weapon will kill.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.232
Page, you're next.

36:40.266 --> 36:41.600
- I made my weapon to cut.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.935
The idea of hacking
through heavy bones

36:43.969 --> 36:46.972
with it really has me nervous.

36:47.005 --> 36:55.914
*

36:55.947 --> 36:58.617
- All right, Page. Let's talk
about the balance of your blade.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.019
It actually feels good
for chopping.

37:01.052 --> 37:05.424
Your blade cut in deep,
and it cut through the ribs,

37:05.457 --> 37:08.827
and those kinds
of cuts will kill.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.629
*

37:10.662 --> 37:12.864
Okay, bladesmiths, next up
is the strength test.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.032
Dave?

37:14.065 --> 37:15.701
*

37:15.734 --> 37:17.636
- Gentlemen, to test
the strength of your weapon,

37:17.669 --> 37:21.006
I'll take two chops
into these pieces of bamboo.

37:21.039 --> 37:22.574
Now, remember, this isn't about

37:22.608 --> 37:23.942
what your weapon
does to the bamboo,

37:23.975 --> 37:26.845
but what the bamboo
does to your weapon.

37:26.878 --> 37:29.315
Brock, you're up first.
- No turning back.

37:29.348 --> 37:31.283
The blade warping
as badly as it did

37:31.317 --> 37:33.585
was not something I expected.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.354
I'm just worried about
how that warp

37:35.387 --> 37:37.356
is gonna affect the testing.

37:37.389 --> 37:38.557
*

37:41.693 --> 37:43.329
- Notice the shape there,

37:43.362 --> 37:44.996
so we'll see
how we do after these cuts.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.632
- Ah.

37:46.665 --> 37:53.605
*

37:58.076 --> 38:00.312
- All right, so,
will you take a look at that?

38:00.346 --> 38:03.014
We've actually straightened
the blade out quite a bit.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.384
It's very hard to line
that blade up

38:05.417 --> 38:06.785
when it's got that bend to it,

38:06.818 --> 38:08.520
but it did cut,

38:08.554 --> 38:13.425
and I'm not seeing
any damage to the edge.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.394
Nicely done.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.929
Page, you are up next, sir.
You ready?

38:17.963 --> 38:19.097
- Yes, sir.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.533
Brock's blade: no edge damage.

38:21.567 --> 38:24.836
And the blade's straighter than
it was when David picked it up.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.505
It's unbelievable.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.974
The things that should have
taken Brock

38:29.007 --> 38:30.942
out of this competition don't.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.077
He's like a cockroach.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.812
You can't kill it!

38:33.845 --> 38:36.515
*

38:36.548 --> 38:38.116
[laughing]

38:38.149 --> 38:45.323
*

38:47.459 --> 38:50.095
- You seem to have an issue
developing right there

38:50.128 --> 38:52.664
with a flake of metal
starting to come up.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.700
Things like that start
to give me pause about

38:54.733 --> 38:56.502
whether that blade
is going to hold up

38:56.535 --> 38:58.570
as we go forward in testing.

38:58.604 --> 38:59.771
Still sharp.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.907
*

39:01.940 --> 39:05.377
All right, I'm okay pushing this
on to the sharpness test.

39:05.411 --> 39:07.379
- Thank you, sir.

39:07.413 --> 39:10.582
- Bladesmiths, to see
how sharp your akrafena is,

39:10.616 --> 39:12.083
I will take your sword
and deliver

39:12.117 --> 39:15.020
a slash across
these ropes and cargo straps.

39:15.053 --> 39:17.155
Let's see how many
they can cut through.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.857
Brock, you're up first.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.459
- Let's do it.

39:20.492 --> 39:24.730
*

39:24.763 --> 39:26.164
- Ready.

39:26.197 --> 39:34.706
*

39:34.740 --> 39:38.444
- Okay, Brock, your blade was
able to cut through two ropes,

39:38.477 --> 39:40.612
two of these ratchet straps,

39:40.646 --> 39:42.514
and almost through
the fifth rope.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.516
I don't see that it's picked up
any more of a bend,

39:44.550 --> 39:47.986
and overall,
your blade will cut.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.421
Page, you're next. You ready?

39:49.455 --> 39:50.989
- Yes, sir.

39:51.022 --> 39:57.963
*

40:03.902 --> 40:05.671
- All right, Page.
we were able to cut through

40:05.704 --> 40:08.607
at least eight
strands over here.

40:08.640 --> 40:11.443
I don't see that you picked up
any bend in your blade here,

40:11.477 --> 40:13.779
and overall,
your blade will cut.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.648
- Thank you.
- Good job.

40:16.682 --> 40:18.950
- I think the only real flaw
I had was that warpage.

40:18.984 --> 40:21.119
Page had some issues
on his blade edge,

40:21.152 --> 40:22.721
so who knows how it'll go?

40:22.754 --> 40:25.524
*

40:25.557 --> 40:29.160
- Bladesmiths, the judges have
finished their deliberation,

40:29.194 --> 40:31.162
and I have a final decision.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.632
But before that, they have
some feedback for both of you.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.166
Dave?

40:35.200 --> 40:36.768
- Page, you brought us
a very effective weapon.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.737
What I would have liked
to have seen

40:38.770 --> 40:41.673
is maybe a little less time
gilding a handle

40:41.707 --> 40:44.042
and a little bit more time
working on things

40:44.075 --> 40:46.144
like that delamination
in your blade.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.846
But it did well
in all of our tests.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.214
It's got the proper shape.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.550
The proper feel in the grip.
Nicely done.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.785
- Thank you, sir.
- Doug?

40:53.819 --> 40:57.022
- Brock, I like
the feel of your weapon.

40:57.055 --> 41:00.492
Now, you went for the authentic
thing by using iron

41:00.526 --> 41:02.594
and unhardenable
steel in your weapon,

41:02.628 --> 41:04.129
which is a gutsy move.

41:04.162 --> 41:06.097
That may be the reason
why it picked up the bend,

41:06.131 --> 41:09.568
but yours didn't crack,
and it stayed sharp.

41:09.601 --> 41:11.202
That's cool.

41:11.236 --> 41:14.239
- Bladesmiths, you've both done
fantastic work,

41:14.272 --> 41:16.842
but there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion,

41:16.875 --> 41:19.210
and that champion is...

41:19.244 --> 41:23.615
*

41:23.649 --> 41:24.983
Page, congratulations.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.985
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion.

41:27.018 --> 41:30.088
Brock, your weapon
did not make the cut.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.823
Jason will explain.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.825
- Well, Brock, I loved
the authentic look

41:33.859 --> 41:35.727
that you brought
with your blade,

41:35.761 --> 41:37.295
but ultimately,

41:37.328 --> 41:39.030
I think you had
more wrought iron

41:39.064 --> 41:41.867
than you had high-carbon
steel in the core,

41:41.900 --> 41:44.703
and though the edge
didn't chip, it did bend,

41:44.736 --> 41:48.273
and that's why we have
to send you home.

41:48.306 --> 41:51.209
- Brock, please
surrender your weapon.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.944
- I came here to win,

41:52.978 --> 41:55.647
but, you know,
I'm happy with what I did.

41:55.681 --> 41:57.816
I learned a lot
from the experience.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.751
I don't think you should
ever stop challenging yourself.

41:59.785 --> 42:02.654
It's back to the forge,
making new things every day,

42:02.688 --> 42:04.923
so I'm excited
to get back to that.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.257
*

42:06.291 --> 42:07.793
- Page, congratulations.

42:07.826 --> 42:09.227
You are the "Forged
in Fire" champion

42:09.260 --> 42:11.697
and will be receiving
a check for $10,000.

42:11.730 --> 42:12.964
How you feeling right now?

42:12.998 --> 42:16.067
- I'm very relieved
and very happy.

42:16.101 --> 42:19.070
I'm a metal geek, and I've never
won anything like this.

42:19.104 --> 42:22.073
What "Forged in Fire"
pretty much forced me to do

42:22.107 --> 42:25.110
is step way the heck
outside of my comfort zone.

42:25.143 --> 42:27.245
I'd like to thank Brock
for being a worthy opponent.

42:27.278 --> 42:29.214
He gave me a fair run
for the money.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.316
He really made me work
for this one.

42:31.349 --> 42:35.621
*
