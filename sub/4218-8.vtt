WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:04.712
Shooters are in the window!

00:06.632 --> 00:07.924
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:08.092 --> 00:10.093
Leon?
What the hell
are you doing here, Leon?

00:10.260 --> 00:11.886
You know this guy?
He's my brother.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.179
I can't do it.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.764
I don't love him.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.016
I mean, I can't have a child
growing up like that.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.060
I don't mean
to butt into your business
or anything, but...

00:19.228 --> 00:20.269
It's Thanksgiving.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.105
Why don't you go home
and spend it
with your husband?

00:23.565 --> 00:25.566
Crystal meth! Masks on!

00:25.734 --> 00:26.651
Okay, listen up.

00:26.819 --> 00:29.028
Everyone on the scene will
have a baseline drug test.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.196
Today.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.739
I may have taken something
this morning.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.199
Will it show up
on the test?

00:33.367 --> 00:35.785
Will these narcotics
show up on a drug test?

00:35.953 --> 00:37.036
You Severide?

00:37.204 --> 00:38.121
Fill 'er up.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.956
Mom has just got to realize,

00:40.124 --> 00:42.542
I'm not gonna
run from something
I want to do with my life

00:42.710 --> 00:44.377
just to make
her feel better.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.546
I got a woman
about to give birth
on the highway.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.256
It's coming!
One more big breath.
Push.

00:51.009 --> 00:51.718
I want us to have a baby.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.845
I don't know if I'm ever
gonna want kids.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.227
Why the hell
are you studying Japanese?

01:01.395 --> 01:04.439
I read online
that once you turn 50,

01:04.606 --> 01:07.567
your brain starts to atrophy
unless you keep it in shape.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.652
I think that train's already
left the station, Mouch.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.280
Say something in Japanese.
I just started.

01:12.448 --> 01:13.698
Hey, uh, where's Herrmann?

01:13.866 --> 01:15.158
Tony Robbins seminar?

01:15.325 --> 01:17.118
I got 20 bucks
says in two weeks,

01:17.286 --> 01:18.661
you won't be able
to string along one sentence.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.997
Easiest money I ever made.
Done.

01:21.165 --> 01:23.833
What's today?
Uh, 29th.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.210
Ah, damn it.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.962
Everything all right?
Yeah, no.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.589
I just forgot something.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.049
Hey, everybody,
we have the pleasure
of hosting

01:32.217 --> 01:33.676
a couple visiting
firefighters again.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.137
This is Gavin and Presley.

01:36.305 --> 01:38.681
They will be observing
over the next
couple of shifts.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.350
Lieutenant Casey.
Lieutenant Severide.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.479
And the rest
of the knuckleheads.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.856
Hey, guys. Thanks so much
for allowing us to be here.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.484
And let us know
if there's anything
we can do to help out.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.569
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:52.529 --> 01:55.156
Was that a Canadian
"out" I heard?

01:55.324 --> 01:56.324
Yes, sir. Toronto.

01:56.492 --> 01:58.576
We both just finished
our probationary period.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.161
You know what?

02:01.663 --> 02:02.663
Welcome aboard, guys.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.041
No offense, but
someone else will have
to give you the tour,

02:05.209 --> 02:06.834
'cause it ain't gonna be me.

02:10.798 --> 02:11.839
Ignore him.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.595
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61.

02:17.763 --> 02:20.056
Injury on the Blue Line.
Logan Square Station.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.820
Be aware, men. The third rail
could still be hot.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.072
You heard him, guys.
Everyone keep
their eyes forward.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.406
Let's do this the right way.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.451
Main, do we have a hold
on the Blue Line power
at Logan Square?

02:40.619 --> 02:43.496
Standby.
We're waiting
for confirmation.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.081
I think I hit someone.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.250
Chief, we might have
a victim on the tracks.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.334
Conductor thinks
he hit someone.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.920
You and Mills walk back down
toward the tunnel.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.547
Mind that third rail.
Copy.

02:55.050 --> 02:55.842
All good.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.969
CTA confirms power
has been shut down.

02:58.136 --> 03:01.097
Cruz, we got the all clear.
Throw the chain.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.645
Yo! Hey, I see somebody!

03:07.813 --> 03:10.481
Three, two, one, go!

03:13.110 --> 03:16.529
Main, we still have power
on the southbound track!

03:16.697 --> 03:18.239
Please help me.

03:18.407 --> 03:21.033
His leg is stuck in the axle.
I need this rail turned off.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.785
We're workin'
on it, Casey.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.538
- My name's Matt.
- Jacob.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.622
What happened, Jacob?

03:26.790 --> 03:29.834
My sister Kayla and me
went into the subway
through an access door,

03:30.002 --> 03:31.335
just to look around.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.170
But it locked behind us.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.214
We were...
We were trying to get out
through the tunnel...

03:35.382 --> 03:36.757
I'll go.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.760
Chief, there's another kid
in the tunnel.
Mills is going inside.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.971
I got two victims
on the track.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.307
I need the damn
power off now.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.641
Kayla!

03:47.686 --> 03:49.020
Come on out!

03:49.187 --> 03:51.439
Supervisor has confirmed
power has been shut down.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.608
Cruz, throw the chain again.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.903
Three, two, one, go!

03:58.155 --> 03:59.572
Power's off!

03:59.740 --> 04:01.949
What's his name?
Jacob.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.911
Jacob, my name is Kelly.
We're gonna get you
out of there, all right?

04:06.955 --> 04:08.581
Let's get that
pressure dressing ready.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.258
There we go.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.136
All right, Rico,
that's good.

04:23.513 --> 04:27.558
Kayla!

04:34.816 --> 04:35.942
This is gonna hurt, buddy.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.111
Okay, buddy, hang on.
Hang on.

04:42.491 --> 04:43.783
Watch his head.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.163
Hey, Jacob.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.873
My... My sister?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.249
We're looking for her now.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.835
All right, pressure dressing's
in place. Let's go.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.629
One, two, three!

05:00.008 --> 05:00.758
Mills?

05:00.926 --> 05:02.969
You're gonna
be okay, Jacob.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.230
Mills?

05:32.749 --> 05:36.377
Yeah, we, uh,
found the victim.

05:36.545 --> 05:40.548
I need two body bags,
more lights, latex gloves.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.551
Two teams scour
each side of the tracks.

05:43.719 --> 05:47.054
Call out
whatever body part you find.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.305
Hey.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.017
You okay?

06:29.347 --> 06:31.307
The department counselor.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.685
Wasn't easy
what we saw today.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.731
And there is no shame
in reaching out
to talk to somebody.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.236
Hey, take a seat, guys.
Make yourselves at home.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.529
Okay.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.698
Hey.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.619
Act right.
Copy that, Chief.

06:56.166 --> 07:00.044
So how's
that socialized medicine
working out for you guys?

07:00.212 --> 07:01.212
Mouch!

07:01.379 --> 07:05.883
To get your tonsils out,
I heard you gotta wait
in a line around the block

07:06.051 --> 07:09.345
for the same doctor
who just finished
a colonoscopy.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.515
You're the only guy
I know that could have
a beef with Canada.

07:12.682 --> 07:16.435
Let's just say
I got a snootful of how things
really work up there.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.897
Nothing against these two,
but pull that curtain back
a little bit.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.024
You might be surprised
at what you find.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.485
Yeah, again,
you can ignore him.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.905
Mouch, you are
out of your damn mind.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.959
Shay, you've got a guest
on the apparatus floor.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.588
I thought you were
going home.

07:44.756 --> 07:47.091
Well, Daniel's not back
from Phoenix
until later today,

07:47.259 --> 07:50.177
so, you wanna
have some lunch?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.472
It's not a good time, Clarice.
I gotta get back...

07:53.640 --> 07:57.768
Look, it's turkey and Brie,
with cranberry,
from Martinelli's.

07:57.936 --> 07:58.936
I thought they closed.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.980
They opened up again
over in Forest Glen.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.943
Mmm.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.487
Here, here, here.
Feel this.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.406
Whoa. What is that?

08:10.574 --> 08:11.824
It's his elbow.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.785
Wait, or no.
Maybe it's his foot.
It's crazy, right?

08:14.953 --> 08:16.078
Yeah.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.455
Did you guys
pick out names yet?

08:19.291 --> 08:21.542
No. We are still
in the middle of negotiations.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.253
Daniel really wants
to name him after his father.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.546
Oh.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.673
Gilbert.
Oh.

08:27.841 --> 08:31.635
Yeah, I know. I remember
when we used to pick out
baby names.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.890
Yeah.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.644
Yeah.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.606
Look, maybe I
shouldn't have said that.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.402
Ambulance 61.
Difficulty Breathing...

08:48.570 --> 08:49.320
I gotta go.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.738
Oh.
26 Orchard Street.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.032
Thanks. Thanks for lunch.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.080
What, I can't
eat a sandwich?

09:01.333 --> 09:02.958
Hi, Gabby.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.335
Hi, Clarice.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.007
She had a seizure.
Then couldn't breathe.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.800
Grace, can you hear me?

09:13.011 --> 09:14.053
She's responsive.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.763
Has this ever happened before?
No.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.765
I mean, yes.
She's had a seizure before.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.600
Is she taking
any anti-seizure medication?

09:19.768 --> 09:21.602
No, the doctors
never found anything.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.604
But she has celiac disease.

09:23.772 --> 09:26.523
She's... She's been on
a gluten-free diet
for the last two months.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.691
Diminished lungs.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.818
Okay, let's get her
to Chicago U.
No.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.570
Ma'am, we've got to get
Grace to the hospital.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.572
Not Chicago U.
My father died
at that hospital.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.074
Please don't take her there.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.618
Okay, fine. Lakeshore.
But we've got to go now.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.757
Hey. Easy, Grace. Easy.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.218
I don't like
the way it smells.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.844
You don't like
the way what smells,
sweetheart?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.389
Six-year-old girl.
Respiratory distress.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.682
History of undiagnosed
seizures.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.600
Exam room two.
We'll take her from here.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.103
I'm right here,
but we can't do...

10:04.271 --> 10:06.105
Oh, my God.
Please don't hurt her.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.565
Something's up
with that chick.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.869
Works better
if you turn on the heat.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.990
Hour, hour-and-a-half, tops.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.701
Okay. I'll have
Cruz cover Truck
until you're back.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.036
Got it.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.539
And I'm sorry about this,
you know this isn't my style,
but...

11:05.707 --> 11:06.707
Handle your business.

11:08.877 --> 11:09.960
Oh, uh...

11:11.004 --> 11:12.671
Keep an eye on Mills for me.

11:12.839 --> 11:13.839
Yeah, sure.

11:17.761 --> 11:18.761
Hey. Quick favor?

11:19.971 --> 11:20.971
Sure.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.433
Shay and I feel a little
weird about this call
we just went on.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.602
We need someone
to pull some medical
records for us,

11:26.770 --> 11:28.896
so, I was wondering
if maybe Hallie could
do us a solid?

11:29.064 --> 11:32.775
Yeah, uh, only thing is,
me and Hallie
are taking a break. So...

11:34.152 --> 11:36.278
Right. Got it. Say no more.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.781
And I'm sorry to hear that.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.703
You're calling Kendra.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.669
This is gonna cost me
a dinner or two.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.963
I mean, guaranteed
she asks me to dinner

11:55.131 --> 11:57.424
and I really don't want
to hear about her...

11:57.592 --> 11:59.051
Hey, Kendra.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.429
Yeah. Yeah.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.642
Uh-huh. Okay. All right,
thank you so much.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.269
And, hey, this conversation
never took place.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.815
Yeah. Friday?

12:12.982 --> 12:15.734
Um,
can I get back to you?

12:16.653 --> 12:17.861
Thanks.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.906
Uh, so, Grace was taken
to the ER twice

12:21.074 --> 12:23.158
in the last six weeks
for seizures.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.536
No mention anywhere
in her record
of celiac disease.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.083
Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.752
Heart attack victim.
Dearborn and Elm.

12:40.885 --> 12:44.179
Frank's dead.
He must've had
a heart attack or something.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.724
One minute he was fine.
He was chopping branches
to me.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.227
And the next thing I know,
he's just hanging there.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.572
Cruz! Get that aerial
into that tree now!

13:01.739 --> 13:04.366
I can get close,
but there's a lot of branches.
I don't see a clean path.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.576
Then we make one.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.244
Vargas!
On it!

13:07.412 --> 13:09.079
Don't you need
a stokes basket?

13:09.247 --> 13:11.331
That limb's not gonna give us
enough time.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.293
We rig a 2-to-1 pulley system,
we bring him down
the fast way.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.172
Got it!

13:25.847 --> 13:27.598
Path is clear.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.099
Let's go.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.656
When Severide drops his line,
take up the slack.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.658
When he cuts the old line,
it's on you.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.625
Hey! He's alive!

13:54.792 --> 13:55.792
Get him down here fast!

13:59.380 --> 14:02.132
Hadley! Move!
Get his back.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.561
Grab it! Grab that rope!

14:14.729 --> 14:15.729
We got it, Kelly!

14:18.149 --> 14:19.233
Tie it off.

14:26.991 --> 14:27.991
Set.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.705
Load is yours.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.587
Steady...

14:47.345 --> 14:49.221
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.931
Let's get on the ground.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.525
- Easy, easy.
- Watch his head.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.371
All right. He's breathing.
Shallow respirations.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.498
Hey, he's carrying candy.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.709
He could be a diabetic.
Let's check his blood sugar.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.504
Okay. It's low, below 20.

15:22.672 --> 15:23.755
I'll give him an amp of D50.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.307
What happened?

15:33.474 --> 15:35.934
Okay.
Sir, you're gonna be okay.
Your blood sugar dropped.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.061
Are you diabetic?
Mmm-hmm.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.354
Okay.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.427
Hey, Matt.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.721
Christie.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.519
Jim.
Matt.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.521
Sweetheart, you remember
your Uncle Matt,

16:21.689 --> 16:24.066
from Thanksgiving
a couple years ago?

16:24.233 --> 16:25.484
Hey, Violet.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.948
You're so grown up.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.292
Fifteen years.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.712
That's crazy.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.966
I still miss him.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.694
Well, we'll let you have
some time alone.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.446
You don't have to go.
No, it's okay.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.074
We were just leaving.
We've been here a while.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.995
I guess I'll see you
in a couple weeks.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.456
Yeah, I'll see you there.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.017
We've all been there.

17:42.103 --> 17:45.272
Usually happens
first few months
after being on the job.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.108
Right now you have nothing
to compare it to.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.778
But you will.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.408
The longer you work,
the more good you do,

17:56.576 --> 17:58.910
you'll be able
to take days like this,
put them into context

17:59.078 --> 18:00.746
and then move forward.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.789
It's just afterwards...

18:04.333 --> 18:09.171
I'm looking at Mouch
telling stories and Cruz
playing video games.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.426
I don't know how they do it.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.846
Everybody has their own way
and how they deal with things.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.434
You will get
on the other side
of this, Peter.

18:24.479 --> 18:25.812
You know what?

18:25.980 --> 18:27.522
Take the rest of shift off.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.483
Go easy.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.235
I'm serious, though.
Talk to someone.

18:32.403 --> 18:35.697
The counselor's available,
so am I.
So's your lieutenant.

18:37.408 --> 18:38.533
Okay?

18:40.077 --> 18:41.578
Okay.

18:46.542 --> 18:50.003
Oh, yeah. It stays with me.
For sure.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.880
Thank you, dude.

18:52.048 --> 18:56.343
My buddy Eddie over at 61,
he's "sworn to secrecy."

18:56.511 --> 18:59.304
Uh, the Canadians,
guess where they're from?

18:59.472 --> 19:00.639
Canada.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.225
Cleveland.
What?

19:03.392 --> 19:05.936
Herrmann put 'em up to it.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.939
Oh, that sneaky
son of a bitch.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.358
He's the only one
I confided to
about me and Canada

19:11.526 --> 19:12.859
and this is what
he does to me?

19:13.027 --> 19:15.654
I don't know
what Herrmann's end game
is in this prank,

19:15.822 --> 19:19.491
but if you're asking me,
I say we beat him to it.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.411
Yeah.
Yeah?

19:23.579 --> 19:25.664
Yeah.
Yes. All right.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.919
Hey, Shay.
You got a visitor again.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.213
Clarice again?

19:33.381 --> 19:35.966
Her husband.
Hmm.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.384
Nice to see you.

19:37.552 --> 19:40.262
I'm looking for my wife.
And my unborn son.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.598
Would you be kind enough
to point me
in the right direction?

19:43.766 --> 19:46.393
Yeah.
She's been staying with me
a couple days.

19:47.937 --> 19:51.398
So, in light of the fact that
you have zero boundaries,

19:51.566 --> 19:53.233
I will tell you now
very directly

19:53.401 --> 19:54.317
that if you think
I'm gonna stand...

19:54.485 --> 19:58.071
Daniel, you might want
to bring it down a peg
because this is your problem.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.781
Right. You have nothing
to do with it.

19:59.949 --> 20:03.201
She came to me, as a friend,
needing a place to stay.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.495
So, I, as a friend,
took her in.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.330
I sympathize with what
you're going through

20:07.498 --> 20:08.999
and I wish I hadn't been
brought into this,

20:09.166 --> 20:11.376
but you keep on coming at me
like you're coming at me,

20:11.544 --> 20:14.421
I'm gonna tell you
to kiss my ass
in two seconds.

20:20.136 --> 20:23.680
What can I do?
This is my family
we're talking about.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.399
I can't get it
out of my head.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.777
I just... I can't get it
out of my head.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.488
There was a time
when your father
couldn't either.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.701
And his way of fixing it
was to just shove it down.

20:45.828 --> 20:49.497
And then that turned into
shutting off
a part of himself.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.335
It's the part
that makes us human.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.254
Then what do I do?

20:57.214 --> 20:58.381
Walk away.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.426
You come back
to the restaurant.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.179
I don't want you to become
a block of ice.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.098
And having seen that
in your father,

21:07.266 --> 21:09.142
believe me,
you don't want
that for yourself.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.023
It's not who you are.
Hmm?

21:16.692 --> 21:19.069
Just come home.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.826
Anna! Hey, it's me.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.663
Look, um, I need a refill.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.706
Uh, somewhat urgently.

21:33.334 --> 21:36.211
I know, I know, I know.
I... I just...

21:36.379 --> 21:38.338
Can you please
just help me out?

21:39.465 --> 21:41.758
I can't.
I don't have the time.

21:43.511 --> 21:46.554
I could... I could pay you
for them if that's easier.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.184
Anna.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.062
Hello?

22:09.370 --> 22:10.829
Oh, she's pissed.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.248
Hey, Kendra.
Thanks for doing this.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.583
Thought I was done.
Ah, well, you know...

22:15.751 --> 22:16.918
Anything on Grace Wilkinson?

22:22.341 --> 22:25.051
Yeah, she accidentally
swallowed some turpentine.

22:25.219 --> 22:26.761
Her mom told us
she had celiac disease.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.723
Uh, mom told us
she was doing some painting

22:29.890 --> 22:32.100
and left the turpentine out
by mistake.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.520
We pumped the girl's stomach,
then moved her upstairs
for observation.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.856
She didn't want to take her
to Chicago U, remember?

22:38.024 --> 22:39.566
Could be hospital jumping
to hide abuse?

22:39.734 --> 22:42.277
Abuse that she's causing
for attention.

22:43.404 --> 22:44.487
It fits.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.114
That would explain
the mom's behavior,

22:46.282 --> 22:48.116
the inconsistent symptoms
that Grace is having,

22:48.284 --> 22:50.076
that smell
she was talking about?

22:50.244 --> 22:53.204
Munchausen by proxy?
It's quite rare.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.706
I don't really care
what you call it.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.083
That woman is poisoning
her own kid.

22:57.251 --> 23:00.295
I want this reported to DCFS.
Right now.

23:00.463 --> 23:01.463
Will you back us up?

23:03.007 --> 23:04.799
Dinner. Friday. On me.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.261
I'll get the number.

23:11.057 --> 23:14.601
Four years ago,
my old partner and I
reported this girl

23:14.769 --> 23:18.063
with cigarette burns
all over her arms
and legs to DCFS.

23:18.230 --> 23:22.067
And the investigation
was a mess of red tape
from beginning to end.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.152
They eventually sent the girl
back to her father.

23:25.529 --> 23:30.033
And that same week,
she died of a brain bleed
from a beating he gave her.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.579
That ain't happening again.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.333
Hey. Mrs. Mills.
Hello, Kelly.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.335
Chief Boden's office
is this way?
Yeah.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.088
How's Peter doing?

23:44.173 --> 23:46.966
He saw a girl cut
to pieces today.
I believe you all did.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.512
How are you doing?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.271
Ingrid.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.025
It's been a long time.
Yes, it has.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.612
Well, please, have a seat.
No, I won't be long.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.327
Peter's not like Henry.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.288
No one expects him to be.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.456
He does.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.877
And Peter's got
this whole idea of living up
to his father's memory.

24:24.338 --> 24:27.132
But that's not the life
I want for him.

24:29.552 --> 24:32.095
And Peter's not coming back
to 51.

24:32.263 --> 24:33.888
If that's what he decides,

24:35.599 --> 24:36.933
I'll abide by it.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.102
You have my word.
You're not hearing me.

24:40.312 --> 24:44.440
Peter's time as a Candidate
is done.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.237
I'm asking you
to respect my wishes.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.574
You owe me that at least.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.624
I can tell you that
the soup already smells
like socks, Otis.

25:01.792 --> 25:05.545
Oh, just wait till it hits
your taste buds, men!

25:05.713 --> 25:08.131
Listen, if we've done
anything to offend you...

25:08.299 --> 25:13.511
No, no, no. Eat up.
Enjoy your free American meal.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.098
Is Peter coming back?

25:17.266 --> 25:20.310
Of course.
He's just clearing his head.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.478
Today was a tough one.

25:23.439 --> 25:26.232
Here we go!
Dinner's served.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.317
What is hell is this?

25:27.484 --> 25:30.361
Borscht, baby.
Mama's Sunday night go-to.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.405
Huh?

25:32.573 --> 25:34.616
Eh? It's good, right?

25:34.783 --> 25:36.576
We're ordering in.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.959
Hey.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.544
Nice job up there
in that tree.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.546
Thanks, Chief.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.133
What up with your arm?

25:52.301 --> 25:53.259
What's that?

25:53.427 --> 25:55.178
I said, "What up
with your arm?"

25:56.513 --> 25:58.681
I tweaked it
a couple days ago
lifting weights.

25:59.642 --> 26:00.850
Looked like more than a tweak.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.312
Really, I'm fine.

26:06.357 --> 26:07.232
Okay.

26:09.068 --> 26:13.238
I see it again,
you're going in for an x-ray.
For your own sake.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.156
No, yeah, absolutely.

26:36.887 --> 26:39.055
DCFS looked into
the Wilkinson girl's case.

26:41.225 --> 26:42.684
"Not gonna pursue."

26:44.144 --> 26:45.812
Let's take a ride.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.697
Listen, all I'm saying is,
I told you
after your suspension hearing

26:55.864 --> 26:58.741
that I'd pull up on the reins
if you started to go sideways.

26:58.909 --> 27:01.035
This is me pulling.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.204
Just having
a friendly conversation.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.959
Uh, Mrs. Wilkinson,
sorry to bother you
like this, uh...

27:08.127 --> 27:11.963
You've got some nerve.
Fabricating lies against me.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.174
Lies? You want
to talk about lies?
What was that today?

27:15.342 --> 27:16.926
A seizure related to
celiac disease

27:17.094 --> 27:18.928
or accidental ingestion
of turpentine?

27:19.096 --> 27:20.763
This is harassment
and I'm calling my lawyer.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.807
You should call your doctor,
because you need help.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.017
You're poisoning
your own daughter.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.101
We are not gonna
stand by and...

27:25.269 --> 27:28.730
You have no idea
how miserable
your life is about to get.

27:41.035 --> 27:43.161
I've been on the phone
for the last hour.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.787
I'm getting my ass
handed to me.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.748
And there wasn't a damn thing
I could say in your defense

27:46.915 --> 27:48.416
because what you did
was dead wrong.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.501
Chief, she's poisoning
her daughter.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.295
Did you talk to the DCFS?

27:52.463 --> 27:54.047
Yeah, but...
But nothing!

27:57.968 --> 27:59.552
You let them handle it.
What you don't do

27:59.720 --> 28:02.221
is go knocking on doors
and start throwing out
accusations.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.723
Do you not get it, Gabriela?

28:03.891 --> 28:05.141
It's not just her, Chief...

28:05.309 --> 28:06.642
I'll get to you in a second.

28:09.730 --> 28:10.897
Answer my question.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.692
Yeah, Chief. I get it.

28:14.860 --> 28:15.860
Do you not like your partner?

28:16.820 --> 28:18.404
I like her very much
indeed, sir.

28:18.572 --> 28:19.739
Well, she's a hothead.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.366
What you do
when you got a hothead
for a partner

28:21.533 --> 28:26.120
is you talk them out of doing
stupid-ass things that can
get them into serious trouble.

28:26.997 --> 28:31.250
Gabriela, this, um, crusade

28:31.418 --> 28:33.503
that you are on,
it ends now.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.881
You take one step further,
there will not be
a suspension hearing.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.508
There will be a goodbye party.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.889
You two. My office.
We need to talk about Mills.

28:54.441 --> 28:55.817
Hey. Kelly.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.568
Hey. Is your brother here?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.821
Last I talked to him
he said he was gonna
go for a drive,

28:59.988 --> 29:02.073
but I haven't
heard from him
for a while.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.367
Yeah, he hasn't been
picking up his phone.

29:04.535 --> 29:05.743
I've never seen him
like this.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.289
Okay, well, if you talk
to him, could you tell him
that I stopped by?

29:10.457 --> 29:13.126
I just wanted to check on him.
I will. Thank you.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.966
You have to go home.
To what?

29:21.510 --> 29:25.179
To a husband,
who's at least owed
an explanation.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.974
Okay, but I just...
I didn't even realize
how unhappy I was

29:28.142 --> 29:30.393
until you showed up
at the baby shower.

29:30.561 --> 29:35.022
You don't get to come back,
married and pregnant,
saying that you miss me.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.817
You walked away.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.652
You broke my heart.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.947
And, hey,
that's the way it goes,

29:43.115 --> 29:46.284
but this isn't good for me
right now, Clarice.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.828
I've been fooling myself
these last few days.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.580
I made a mistake.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.838
Okay. If that's Daniel,
I'm just... I'm not here.

29:59.006 --> 30:02.425
I will leave, I will
go home. I will. But just
not right now, please?

30:06.847 --> 30:07.930
Hey!

30:08.098 --> 30:09.557
Hey, Corrine.

30:09.725 --> 30:10.933
I texted you a couple times.

30:11.101 --> 30:14.812
I know, I'm... And I'm sorry.
I've just been
dealing with something...

30:14.980 --> 30:16.898
Everything okay?
Fine. Yeah, it's fine.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.816
It's just... I think
I left my earrings here and...

30:18.984 --> 30:21.152
Oh, I'll find 'em
and I'll get 'em back to you.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.822
I'm sorry. It's just now's
really not a good time.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.038
What was that?
Nothing.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.541
Okay. Um...

30:37.419 --> 30:39.795
I'm gonna go.
Okay.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.048
Look, I didn't mean
to bring up any bad memories.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.012
I don't have any.

30:50.682 --> 30:51.891
I just can't go back.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.026
This should've been ours.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.136
See, this is where
you belong, baby.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.806
Just give me
a little room, Mom.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.940
All right, everybody!
Gather 'round!

31:41.108 --> 31:43.651
We're gonna trade T-shirts
and patches in a bit,

31:43.819 --> 31:45.987
but first,
a little competition.

31:46.154 --> 31:51.242
The first one of you
to climb up to the top
gets a CFD jacket!

31:51.410 --> 31:52.493
Sound good?

31:52.661 --> 31:54.161
That jacket's mine.
Yeah, we'll see.

31:54.329 --> 31:55.496
All right.

31:55.664 --> 32:00.293
And one, two, three!

32:04.172 --> 32:06.549
Take that back
to Cleveland, boys!

32:09.136 --> 32:10.928
What the hell are you doing,
Mouch?

32:11.096 --> 32:14.682
They're not from Canada.
Herrmann put 'em up to it.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.225
We're from Canada!

32:16.393 --> 32:20.396
Oh, no, no. Otis said...
Otis... Otis...

32:28.030 --> 32:32.199
Ambulance 61.
Respiratory Distress.
26 Orchard Street.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.660
That's Grace's address.
Hit it.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.126
I didn't know what to do.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.838
Grace. Are you okay?

32:47.090 --> 32:49.550
In here! In here.

33:07.527 --> 33:08.986
Doxepin. 150 milligrams.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.446
Oh, man.

33:12.074 --> 33:14.700
Uh, why don't you take Grace
back to the living room?

33:15.661 --> 33:17.495
Come on. Come with me.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.748
Shallow breaths,
rapid pulse.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.794
All right.
Let's get her to Lakeshore.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.588
I'll start an IV in the rig,
you get
an order to push bicarb.

33:27.756 --> 33:28.756
Yeah.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.552
She's gonna be okay, Grace.

33:37.766 --> 33:38.766
You wanted to see me, Chief?

33:42.229 --> 33:44.897
That time
you put all that hot sauce
in Hadley's burger?

33:45.774 --> 33:46.691
That was funny.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.734
Oh, I can't take credit
for that, Chief.

33:48.902 --> 33:49.902
I got that from
Dumb and Dumber.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.321
And the other time
you put that blow-up doll
in Herrmann's bunk?

33:52.489 --> 33:54.907
That was equally funny.
That was all me.

33:55.909 --> 33:57.785
Today, that was not funny.

34:00.247 --> 34:01.330
I mean...

34:01.498 --> 34:03.124
Breaking bones is one thing,
but those men,

34:04.626 --> 34:07.628
they did not pay
their own way

34:07.796 --> 34:10.715
and drive 10 hours
to come here

34:10.882 --> 34:11.674
to be the butt of a joke.

34:11.842 --> 34:15.219
When we have a guest
in this house,
you will treat them as such.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.595
Do you understand me?

34:17.431 --> 34:18.514
Yes, Chief.

34:18.682 --> 34:21.308
So now you're gonna
walk back out there
like the man I know you to be,

34:21.476 --> 34:22.351
and you're gonna
look 'em in the eyes,

34:22.519 --> 34:23.936
shake their hand
and apologize

34:24.104 --> 34:27.523
because when they go back home
and their men
ask them what CFD were like,

34:27.691 --> 34:30.860
they will be able to say,
we are stand up.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.407
Chief, you need
to get to Lakeshore.

34:39.786 --> 34:40.786
That'll be all.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.583
She couldn't get into
the United States,

34:45.751 --> 34:48.836
so I agreed
to meet her in Toronto.

34:49.004 --> 34:54.550
An immigration attorney there
was gonna facilitate
her American citizenship.

34:54.718 --> 34:57.845
I gave her the five grand
for his fees.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.683
I never saw either one
of them again.

35:02.851 --> 35:05.519
Yeah, but if she was Russian,
why hate on Canada?

35:07.439 --> 35:10.191
Two extra weeks I'm up there
getting the runaround

35:10.358 --> 35:13.486
from various
government agencies.

35:13.653 --> 35:18.491
I end up
at the Canadian
Anti-Fraud Centre.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.701
Wanna know what they said?

35:22.496 --> 35:23.913
"Buyer beware."

35:24.790 --> 35:27.333
And didn't
the weasel behind the counter

35:27.501 --> 35:30.085
get a little chuckle
at my expense?

35:32.881 --> 35:37.343
Mouch, on behalf
of the Commonwealth
of Canada, we apologize.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.513
I appreciate that.

35:44.810 --> 35:45.851
Lieutenant?

35:49.898 --> 35:53.192
I... I don't want to get
into anyone's business here,
but if I may?

35:53.360 --> 35:54.318
Please.

35:54.486 --> 35:57.780
Only because I was recently
in Peter's situation.

35:58.740 --> 36:04.036
I received a call
that involved
an infant mortality

36:04.204 --> 36:07.790
and, uh,
it really got to me.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.085
But our lieutenant
at the time,

36:11.253 --> 36:13.295
he did something
that really helped us out.

36:16.299 --> 36:20.970
She's on a ventilator now.
And dialysis
to help clear the doxepin.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.888
We just have to
wait and see.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.517
Are you Gabriela Dawson?

36:26.685 --> 36:28.561
You're the one
who accused Nina
of poisoning our daughter.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.646
Sir, your wife...
You did this.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.523
You did this to her!

36:42.492 --> 36:44.660
Gabriela,
I've notified the union,

36:44.828 --> 36:46.787
just in case
the cops want to talk to you.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.582
You need to be ready.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.711
Mills. It's Casey.

36:54.629 --> 36:58.007
Listen, I know lots
of people have been
talking at you today. Uh...

36:58.174 --> 37:01.010
But before you make
a decision,
I want to show you something.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.387
I can swing by the restaurant
after shift.

37:03.555 --> 37:06.932
And, um, please,
just trust me on this.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.905
Don't worry.
We'll get through this.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.087
It's all right, sweetheart.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.174
Tell her what you told me.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.892
She made me drink it.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.192
It's okay.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.781
It's okay, sweetie.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.619
You really outdid yourself
this time, Otis.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.955
I feel horrible.
You should.

38:11.122 --> 38:14.124
And what's worse?
They were so classy
about it.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.463
So you were in love
with that woman?

38:21.007 --> 38:22.341
Nah.

38:22.509 --> 38:25.469
Lesson learned, though.
Lesson learned.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.985
Oh, those dicks.

39:08.888 --> 39:11.056
Is Shay here?
She's not.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.683
I just want my earrings.

39:12.851 --> 39:13.976
Um...

39:15.937 --> 39:17.104
Come on in.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.526
You want a beer?
Sure.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.865
You know, I don't know
why she's been so opposed
to calling me back.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.618
She's been going through
some ex-girlfriend drama.

39:31.786 --> 39:33.579
See, all she had to do
was tell me.

39:33.747 --> 39:35.539
I'm not looking
to bring
any drama to her life.

39:35.707 --> 39:36.707
I was just looking
to have some fun.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.793
No, I hear you.
Keep it short and sweet.
That's my policy.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.380
Exactly.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.640
Hmm.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.605
Hey, it's me.
Hey.

39:59.773 --> 40:01.732
Um, real quick. Corrine.

40:02.692 --> 40:04.234
Um, do you have
any claim to her?

40:04.402 --> 40:05.611
Kelly, why?

40:05.779 --> 40:08.614
Because if you do,
then I'll walk her
to the door.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.785
Knock yourself out.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.204
You all right?
Have fun.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.205
Lieutenant Casey.
Gary.

40:58.373 --> 41:00.666
Thanks for letting us stop by.
This is Peter Mills.

41:00.834 --> 41:01.917
Hey, how you doing?

41:02.085 --> 41:03.293
Hey. Nice to meet you.
Come on in.

41:04.546 --> 41:06.880
Make yourselves comfortable.
Thank you.

41:07.048 --> 41:10.092
Sophie!
Lieutenant Casey is here!

41:10.260 --> 41:12.553
Their last house burned down
a couple years back.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.805
We responded to the call.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.181
How's she doing?

41:16.349 --> 41:17.975
She gets her learner's permit
next week.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.059
Can you believe it?

41:19.227 --> 41:20.727
Sophie's driving?

41:20.895 --> 41:21.728
Well, not till next week,
she's not.

41:24.858 --> 41:26.775
Lieutenant Casey!
There she is.

41:31.865 --> 41:34.283
Peter, this is Sophie.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.576
Hey.

41:36.911 --> 41:37.911
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.749
What have you got?

41:43.918 --> 41:45.502
What's this?

41:45.670 --> 41:48.380
"Second Place.
Girls Sectional Finals."

41:49.340 --> 41:51.175
Congratulations.
Thanks.

41:57.056 --> 41:58.682
Sorry.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.351
Don't be. I don't mind.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.978
Lieutenant Casey
pulled me out of that fire.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.277
I'm alive.
