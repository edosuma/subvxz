on "Vanderpump Rules."

00:03.871 --> 00:05.206
- Oh!
- Oh, wow!

00:05.239 --> 00:08.176
- Happy birthday,
Stassi!

00:08.209 --> 00:10.111
- You excited
about Sonoma?

00:10.144 --> 00:11.512
It's gonna be
f---ing amazing.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.514
- I want to go and have
a good time on your birthday.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.183
- Where's Lala?

00:16.750 --> 00:19.820
- Lala's basically just proving
to me that she's shady as f---.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.522
- I think
it's best for me

00:21.555 --> 00:23.224
to walk away
from this whole place.

00:23.257 --> 00:26.360
- Time to grow up
and deal with it.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.196
all: Bridesmaids,
hoo-ha-ha!

00:28.229 --> 00:29.830
- I thought that Ariana
would be here.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.399
- She doesn't even like
being a bridesmaid.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.501
- We have to refold everything.
It's not organized.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.035
- Why are you still
harping over me?

00:35.069 --> 00:37.037
Shut up.
- You guys, stop bickering.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.739
- You f---ing tortured her
this morning.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.007
- I don't know how this
turned against me

00:40.040 --> 00:41.175
all of a sudden here,
'cause I'm about--

00:41.209 --> 00:43.010
I'm about ready to walk out
in two seconds.

that it's our time *

00:50.218 --> 00:52.386
* These are the best days

00:52.420 --> 00:55.089
* Of our lives

00:55.123 --> 00:58.926

* L.A. dreamer
you made me scream, dream *

- Giggy? You need to go
on a Beverly Hills diet,

01:14.475 --> 01:18.146
because I think you've put on
a little bit of weight, fatso.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.213
Let me look at you.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.482
- Oh.
- Come on, that is sexy.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.284
Look at that.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.785
And then you're going
in your bag.

01:24.818 --> 01:25.819
- This is a boy bag.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.356
- It's a boy bag
for a real man.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.158
- I've been passionate
about dogs for years,

01:30.158 --> 01:31.892
so it's a bit of a dream,
really, to kind of--

01:31.925 --> 01:34.061
starting to go
into doggy apparel--

01:34.162 --> 01:36.464
leashes and collars
and bags.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.266
People say
I'm obsessed with dogs,

01:38.299 --> 01:40.734
and you know what?
They're absolutely right.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.638

- Oh, my God!

01:44.672 --> 01:46.540
- Hey, guys.
- Sorry about the craziness.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.841
- No.
- Wait, is that Harrison

01:47.875 --> 01:49.843
popped right in there?
- Yeah, it's Harrison.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.546
- Baby, I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.547
- See you later.
Guys, I'll see you later.

01:53.581 --> 01:54.548
- Good to see you, Ken.
- See you.

01:54.582 --> 01:55.583
- I've got to go to Pump.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.885
- Okay.
- Okay, I have all the dresses

01:57.918 --> 01:59.820
that you wanted me to get.
- Okay, great.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.722
- And I brought my assistant
with me today.

02:01.755 --> 02:02.890
- Your assistant?

02:02.923 --> 02:05.058
We've had so many dresses
over the years.

02:05.092 --> 02:08.061
I mean, there's not
a perfect dress for everybody.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.897
Clearly, I find
the perfect dress,

02:09.930 --> 02:12.266
and this one doesn't like that,
or this one prefers it.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.403
I feel like putting them all
in an orange jumpsuit.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.271
Maybe Jax has got one
I could borrow.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.673
- This is a little
off the shoulder--

02:19.707 --> 02:21.442
- Oh, no, I don't like
the slit up the side.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.110
- There's a little bit
of cleavage off.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.913
- I could try 'em on for you,
just for visual aid.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.581
- I'll pass on that.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.982
That's not
form-fitting enough.

02:29.016 --> 02:32.220
- No, but this is--
- Oh, that's like a tent.

02:32.220 --> 02:35.423
That's the kind of thing I wear
when I'm hiding something.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.924
- So this one wins?
- Okay.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.293
- Yeah, because they're young,
beautiful, and, you know.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.662
- Quarter length
with the gold on the thing.

02:41.695 --> 02:42.863
- Yeah, three-quarter sleeve,
with a deeper V.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.398
- And then on the back.
- How were the trips?

02:44.432 --> 02:45.433
How did everything--

02:45.466 --> 02:49.270
- There was an RV,
there was fast cars.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.371
- How was [indistinct]?

02:50.404 --> 02:52.039
- So much fun.
Way better than staying

02:52.072 --> 02:53.541
in an RV with--
- Did you miss each other?

02:53.574 --> 02:55.509
- Sometimes absence makes
the heart grow fonder.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.278
- Yeah.
- Well, I hope so.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.947
- Yeah.
- I mean, it's not long now.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.916
- I'm having my bridal shower
coming up.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.252
It's, like, the first,
like, big, like,

03:04.252 --> 03:05.353
wedding event
of the season.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.554
- Right.
When are you doing that?

03:06.587 --> 03:07.855
- That's coming up
this coming weekend.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.958
- My bridesmaids have planned
my entire bridal shower

03:10.991 --> 03:12.626
and have not told me
anything.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.363
And unlike all the other
wedding events this summer

03:15.396 --> 03:18.866
that are about me and Tom,
this one is just about me.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.869
- Well, and I also wanted
to invite you to come.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.003
- Me to come?
- Yeah.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.538
My mom, my grandma
are coming to town.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.073
Brittany's mom's
actually gonna be in town,

03:26.106 --> 03:28.576
so I told her
to invite her mom.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.043
If you have time,
stop by.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.546
- I'll come by
for a brief moment,

03:32.580 --> 03:33.881
just to have
a glass of wine with you

03:33.914 --> 03:36.049
or a glass of champagne
with you.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.286
Are you working tonight?
- Oh.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.053
No. I had to get
my shift covered,

03:40.087 --> 03:41.622
because Kristen is doing

03:41.655 --> 03:44.292
a sketch comedy show
at the Improv later.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.926
- She's the least funny person
I know.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.495
- But she was--
but I think

03:47.528 --> 03:49.397
you would actually be
presently surprised.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.598
- You're f---ing
kidding me.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.338
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.906
- What?
- Looks like "Bla-bla" is

03:58.939 --> 04:00.474
trying to get her shift
covered tonight.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.543
- Uh-oh.
- Tom's pissed. Like--

04:02.576 --> 04:03.977
- He should be.
- Like--

04:04.011 --> 04:05.313
- She didn't call
or anything.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.648
- I heard Jax is being
kind of a little dick.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.216
- We just got in, like,
these little bickering,

04:09.317 --> 04:11.985
little arguments, and
we got to get over this stage.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.522
- Yeah.
- My mom is on the way.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.824
Just don't want us to bicker
and stuff in front of her.

04:16.857 --> 04:17.991
- Oh, yeah.
- [laughs]

04:18.025 --> 04:19.827
- Jax came home
for Christmas last year.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.496
He was on his best behavior.
He was winning everyone over,

04:22.530 --> 04:25.333
but Jax needs to shape up
and play nice,

04:25.366 --> 04:27.167
because for now
my mom likes him,

04:27.200 --> 04:28.902
and I would really like it
to stay that way.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.339
- He just loves to hear himself
talk or something.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.506
- Yeah.
Obviously, you know

04:32.540 --> 04:33.841
I'll always keep him
in check for you

04:33.874 --> 04:35.376
if you need me
to knock him around a little.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.678
He needs to f---ing
get his s--- together.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.879
- Oh, I know.

04:38.912 --> 04:39.880

04:39.913 --> 04:42.015
- * You got a light lesson

04:42.049 --> 04:43.851

04:43.884 --> 04:46.687
* You got a light lesson

04:46.720 --> 04:48.589
* Yeah, hey

04:48.622 --> 04:49.923
* Ooh, la la

04:49.957 --> 04:51.759
- You want this glass
with change in it?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.361
- Sure.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.629
* Ooh, la la la
la la la *

04:55.663 --> 04:56.930
- Hey, guys.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.367
- What happened?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.935
[dramatic music]

05:01.969 --> 05:03.604
- I'm gonna be honest
with guys.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.539
At this point,
I don't really feel like

05:05.573 --> 05:07.875
I'm wanting to surround myself
with people

05:07.908 --> 05:10.277
that I don't want to be around.
I love you.

05:10.378 --> 05:13.246
I love you.
But the second I heard

05:13.280 --> 05:14.982
the list of people
that were going,

05:15.015 --> 05:16.784
I had a pit in my stomach
about it the whole time.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.287
- The day before, you were like,
"I can't wait for Sonoma,

05:20.388 --> 05:21.288
can't wait to go."

05:21.389 --> 05:22.990
*

05:23.023 --> 05:25.125
- This is something where
we're trying

05:25.158 --> 05:28.529
to put Lala
into the lion's den.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.964
- If anybody said anything,
you know--I--

05:30.998 --> 05:33.801
- That s--- would have gotten
shut down real f---ing quick.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.035
- We've taken
a lot of grief,

05:35.068 --> 05:36.870
f---ing sticking up for you,
Lala, seriously.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.171
- I-I know that, and I am
forever grateful for that.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.540
- And this is how you
f---ing repay us,

05:39.573 --> 05:41.742
by literally just
ditching out last second?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.477
You couldn't even answer
our text messages.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.414
We got an answer from you
after we already landed.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.482
You handled it
really f---ing selfishly.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.250
- I will gladly
pay you back

05:50.283 --> 05:52.219
for what you guys
spent on my ticket.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.987
- It's not about the money.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.823
It's so much planning,
so much time,

05:55.856 --> 05:57.758
everything went
into this weekend.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.593
- I'm not surrounding myself
with people

05:59.627 --> 06:01.128
who don't bring out
the best in me.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.496
That's just how it is.
- You're not gonna apologize

06:02.530 --> 06:03.564
for not showing up
for your friend's birthday,

06:03.597 --> 06:04.965
the only girl here
who has your back?

06:04.998 --> 06:06.434
- Why are you speaking to me?
Why are you talking to me?

06:06.434 --> 06:08.101
- Because she's one of my
best friends to not show up.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.570
- You don't need
to tell me that.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.838
She can tell me that. You have
nothing to do with this.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.440
- Well, I think she has,
and I'm reiterating it.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.074
- Okay, well,
nobody's talking to you.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.176
I apologize.
I have a gift for you

06:16.209 --> 06:18.579
if you want.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.648
That's what it is.
Um,

06:20.681 --> 06:23.350
yeah, all right.
Thank you guys.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.487
- After the sorry-ass excuse
for an apology,

06:26.520 --> 06:30.023
I think I'm good on Lala,
maybe forever.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.326
Don't need people in my life
that are gonna f--- me over.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.162

Plain and simple.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.471
* Don't look back

06:43.471 --> 06:45.673
* 'Cause this is LA

06:45.706 --> 06:47.475
- This way. I'll follow you.
- Okay.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.109
- I've been
a sketch comedy troupe

06:49.142 --> 06:51.144
with three
of my closest girlfriends.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.281
- I'm loving the no-weave look
on you, lady.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.816
[laughter]

06:55.849 --> 06:57.785
I feel like we've come
a long way,

06:57.818 --> 07:00.187
doing a main stage
at the Improv.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.756
I'm just,
I'm so proud of us.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.058
- Ooh, we got
front-row seats here.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.360
- Where's, uh--

07:07.394 --> 07:11.298
- I am so excited to be here
hosting "Saturday Night Live."

07:13.233 --> 07:14.502
- What?

07:14.535 --> 07:15.536
- That's really embarrassing.

07:15.569 --> 07:18.238
But comics drink
for free, right?

07:21.008 --> 07:22.510
[laughter]

07:22.510 --> 07:24.111
- You guys heard, yes,
this is a comedy show,

07:24.144 --> 07:25.579
and I'm not
a comedian, clearly.

07:25.613 --> 07:26.880
[laughter]

07:26.914 --> 07:28.949
My boyfriend gets really sick
of hearing me talk,

07:28.982 --> 07:31.819
and I need an outlet
other than Snapchat

07:31.852 --> 07:34.054
to force an audience
to listen to me.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.523
So, you're welcome.
[laughter]

07:35.523 --> 07:37.725
Although I was not
invited up here,

07:37.758 --> 07:39.426
per usual,

07:39.527 --> 07:43.597
I invite you all to laugh
your asses off, get drunk,

07:43.631 --> 07:45.633
and don't take comedy
too seriously.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.569
[cheers and applause]

07:48.602 --> 07:50.170
- So Kristen had
a comedy show?

07:50.203 --> 07:51.672
- Yeah, she did sketch
in her free time.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.307
- I take sketch comedy
very seriously, so it offends me

07:54.341 --> 07:58.245
when people just think
that they can just...do it.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.080
- I feel like Ariana
isn't coming tonight,

08:00.113 --> 08:01.915
because she doesn't want
to take the chance

08:01.949 --> 08:04.251
that she might,
I don't know, laugh,

08:04.284 --> 08:07.254
enjoy herself,
think I'm funny.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.156
[phone ringing]

08:09.189 --> 08:10.558
- Kristen, your phone
keeps going off.

08:10.558 --> 08:11.592
- Yeah.
- What?

08:11.625 --> 08:13.561
[text alert]
- Okay. Here it is again.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.229
Are you avoiding someone?
- No.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.565
- Do you have
an embarrassing amount

08:17.565 --> 08:20.033
of dick pics
on your phone?

08:20.067 --> 08:23.771
You could spend hours
deleting every single sausage,

08:23.804 --> 08:26.674
but let's be honest.
Who has time for that?

08:26.707 --> 08:29.109
That's where
the Hung app comes in.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.744
- [laughs]

08:30.778 --> 08:33.413
- The Hung app detects
the first sign of dick pics

08:33.446 --> 08:35.182
and automatically
transforms them

08:35.215 --> 08:37.050
into Pinterest-worthy
works of art.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.886
- Happy birthday, Kristen.
- For me?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.688
Shut up,
where did you get this?

08:40.721 --> 08:43.223
- My ex-boyfriend.
- Oh, my God, you're so bad!

08:43.256 --> 08:46.960
- Transform that shlong shot
into Van Gogh's "Starry Night."

08:48.596 --> 08:51.131
- Rachel, your new painting
is everything.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.300
[dramatic music]

08:53.333 --> 08:55.402
- Yep, that's mine.
I just really wish

08:55.435 --> 08:57.204
that, like, Kristen would've
gave me a heads-up.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.607
I just think it's really odd
that, you know, Kristen

08:59.607 --> 09:01.374
and Rachel are good friends
with Brittany,

09:01.408 --> 09:03.443
but yet they would
kind of go up on stage

09:03.476 --> 09:07.314
and use a picture
of my penis in front of her.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.849
Kind of a low blow.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.618
all: Thanks, Hung app.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.152
[cheers and applause]

09:13.654 --> 09:15.422
Oh, my God.
It better not be.

09:18.859 --> 09:22.295
- I definitely recognize
that dick in that pic.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.363
I mean,
it's my boyfriend.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.798
Of course I know
what it looks like.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.499
- Jax, you want to know
what the saddest thing is,

09:26.533 --> 09:28.201
the fact that
I recognize your dick.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.638
I looked at Tom, I'm like,
"I think that's Jax's dick."

09:30.671 --> 09:31.639
Not because
I recognized it.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.840
- Ex-girlfriend
recognize your dick.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.808
- No, not because--
- 'Cause it went viral.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.009
- Jax was dating
this chick,

09:36.043 --> 09:38.078
and, you know,
he did what Jax does.

09:38.111 --> 09:41.414
He "Jaxed" her, and she
wasn't too happy about that,

09:41.448 --> 09:44.317
so she retaliated
by tweeting a pic

09:44.351 --> 09:45.819
of a dick pic
that he had sent her,

09:45.853 --> 09:48.321
and then she, like, tagged
all of his friends.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.992
Sandoval looked at the pic,
and recognized Jax's shoes,

09:52.025 --> 09:54.662
and the rest is history.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.496
- It's a triumphant,
glorious bastard.

09:56.529 --> 09:57.998
- It's a nice dick.
- [laughs]

09:58.031 --> 09:59.733
- I'm not ashamed
of my penis.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.168
I think it's
a very good-looking penis.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.569
I mean,
it looks like, you know,

10:02.602 --> 10:05.873
probably what porn stars
model their penis after,

10:05.906 --> 10:07.274
or they model
dildos after.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.377
I mean, I would be
a really good dildo model.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.245
- Where's your drink?

10:12.279 --> 10:15.282
- I need one, bad.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.785
- Why, what's wrong?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.352
- I don't know if you
realize this...

10:19.386 --> 10:23.090
[laughs]
But they used Jax's dick pic.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.357
- Are you serious?

10:24.391 --> 10:25.625
- In the show.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.594
- I'm trying to put myself
in your position,

10:27.627 --> 10:29.062
and I would be
equally as upset.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.732
But I really have to say,
I'm so impressed with the fact

10:31.765 --> 10:33.934
that you can call out
your boyfriend's penis

10:33.967 --> 10:37.070
in, like, a photo that's
matched up with something else.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.272
- No, I didn't recognize
Jax's penis.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.975
I mean, I wouldn't recognize any
of my ex-boyfriend's penises.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.243
They all look the same.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.544
They're either like--

10:44.577 --> 10:46.046
or like--

10:46.079 --> 10:47.881
or like, "Mmm."

10:47.915 --> 10:49.783
[playful music]

10:49.817 --> 10:54.554
- Like, hello, I'm dating
this guy, and it's his dick pic.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.724
You guys are my really good
friends, and you couldn't even,

10:56.757 --> 10:59.259
like, give me a heads-up
and, like, let me know

10:59.292 --> 11:00.493
that you were gonna use

11:00.527 --> 11:02.796
a picture
of my boyfriend's penis

11:02.830 --> 11:05.032
who you f---ed before.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.134
I want to, like, ask her.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.870
[dramatic music]

11:09.903 --> 11:12.906
Okay.
So...

11:12.940 --> 11:14.207
I have been thinking

11:14.241 --> 11:16.243
about this whole, like,
penis thing.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.146
I'm kind of upset,
because I would've liked

11:19.179 --> 11:21.849
just a little bit
of heads-up.

11:21.882 --> 11:25.518
- But should I stand onstage
and go, "Jax Taylor, everyone"?

11:25.552 --> 11:26.854
- Instantly, I noticed.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.922
- We wanted to find dick pics,
and then we found it,

11:28.956 --> 11:30.758
and I was like,
"Oh, that's weird."

11:30.758 --> 11:32.659
It's actually a lot harder
than I thought

11:32.760 --> 11:36.997
to just Google "dick pic"
and find a penis photo.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.366
All you get are
a bunch of, like, old men,

11:39.399 --> 11:42.502
politicians
in navy blue suits.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.671
- You can't even see it. It's--
- Listen, all I'm saying is,

11:44.772 --> 11:46.006
like, a little bit
of a heads-up.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.340
- It's a show.
- You're being defensive,

11:47.374 --> 11:49.843
instead of being, like,
"I'm sorry that that happened."

11:49.877 --> 11:52.112
- I had no f---ing clue
about this.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.580
How would you like it,
Kristen,

11:53.613 --> 11:56.183
if I went onstage and showed
Carter's penis to a crowd?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.684
I don't think you would
like it very much.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.787
Wow. This is actually
really f---ed up.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.388
[dramatic music]

12:02.790 --> 12:05.458
- For these girls
to live in LA

12:05.492 --> 12:07.260
and never have been
on a private jet,

12:07.294 --> 12:08.595
it's like,
I don't understand that.

12:17.237 --> 12:17.604
[upbeat music]

12:19.472 --> 12:20.440
all: * Lo-lo-lo-lo-love
- * Don't need anything but

12:20.473 --> 12:22.810
all: * Lo-lo-lo-lo-love

12:22.810 --> 12:24.711
- * Don't want anything but

12:24.812 --> 12:27.815
all: * Lo-lo-lo-lo-love

12:27.815 --> 12:28.816
- Oh, there you are.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.517
- Yes.

12:30.550 --> 12:34.187
- You really want to see
our dining room?

12:34.221 --> 12:38.025
Piggy Bank or Pink Innocence
or Little Princess?

12:38.058 --> 12:39.359
These are all wrong.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.862
[dramatic music]

12:41.895 --> 12:43.997
You're probably thinking
of your future nursery,

12:44.031 --> 12:45.332
not my dining room.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.835
- Lisa is very particular.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.302
- And you shouldn't be
buying these,

12:49.336 --> 12:50.838
you should show me
these first,

12:50.871 --> 12:52.973
then we could
decide on it.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.641
- I wouldn't expect that
from someone

12:54.674 --> 12:56.343
that owns
a million restaurants

12:56.376 --> 12:58.578
and lives in a castle
with a moat.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.080
- So you're working
tonight?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.215
- Um, yes.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.252
No, right.
I'm so tired.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.619
- Why are you tired?

13:06.653 --> 13:09.222
- I went to Kristen's
comedy show.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.323
- And what did Kristen do?

13:10.357 --> 13:13.060
- You know, they made up
a pretend app that,

13:13.093 --> 13:15.295
for single girls
who get sent dick pics,

13:15.328 --> 13:18.665
it will camouflage the dick
into, like, a nice painting.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.733
But you can still see the--
that's the joke,

13:20.767 --> 13:22.402
is that you can still
clearly see it's, like, a dick.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.072
Like, "Look, and you can send
a Happy Birthday card."

13:25.105 --> 13:26.673
- You might as well be speaking
a different language

13:26.706 --> 13:28.241
to me right now.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.609
- Kristen and Stassi
are coming over,

13:29.642 --> 13:31.411
texted that they're
on the way.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.080
'Cause we're gonna listen
to the podcast,

13:33.113 --> 13:34.347
which I'm excited about.

13:34.381 --> 13:38.886
- Would you be willing to take
a sociopath quiz?

13:38.886 --> 13:41.221
- I'm a sociopath, s---.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.755
- So last night was crazy.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.357
- I think it's f---ed up.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.592
- You lied to me.
- I didn't mean to lie,

13:45.625 --> 13:46.726
but you understand
why I did that.

13:46.759 --> 13:47.895
I didn't want to make
a scene, like,

13:47.895 --> 13:49.762
right in the middle
of this comedy show.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.699
- He knows I'm not stupid.
I'm not easily fooled.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.168
I could tell at first glance
that it was his.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.636
I just don't get it.
Like, don't lie to me.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.171
I don't care how big
or how small,

13:58.205 --> 14:00.908
you don't lie
to your girlfriend.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.911
- Why would you send a picture
of your genitalia to somebody?

14:03.911 --> 14:05.345
Why would you?
- I don't know.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.779
- Explain to me,
Katie, you know.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.781
- That part of my life,
like, never really existed.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.517
I didn't get dick pics.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.020
- Nor did I,
and I feel really left out.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.955
- [laughs]

14:14.988 --> 14:17.925
- Roger!

14:17.958 --> 14:20.260
- Hi.
- Don't you guys look cute.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.230
Scoot down so the girls
can sit on the couch.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.464
both: Hi.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.433
- You guys are matching.
You match your apartment.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.701
- Oh, gosh.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.837
- Got a little bone to pick
with you, missy,

14:30.938 --> 14:31.939
about last night
with this dick pic thing.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.040
- With me?

14:33.073 --> 14:34.374
- Jax, I know, has
a collection of them,

14:34.407 --> 14:36.944
because they actually used
one of his dick pics.

14:36.944 --> 14:39.612
- What do mean? So you saw it--
the whole audience?

14:39.646 --> 14:43.250
- Jax had sent this dick pic
to some random girl or whatever,

14:43.283 --> 14:44.584
and she ended up
tweeting it.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.953
- He would just say
it's not his.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.820
- You could tell
by his shoes,

14:47.854 --> 14:51.558
'cause he was taking a picture
down, and--[laughs]

14:51.591 --> 14:53.260
- It's already bad enough

14:53.293 --> 14:55.963
that I had relations
with some of you girls.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.330
- It was a last-minute choice.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.967
- Last minute choice?
It's a dick.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.134
Why would you do that?

15:01.168 --> 15:02.835
- I honestly had no clue
that that was happening.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.671
- Yeah.
I know that, like, Rachel,

15:04.704 --> 15:05.973
neither of us even thought
it was like--

15:06.006 --> 15:08.976
- Yeah. The whole room is
looking at his penis.

15:08.976 --> 15:12.980
So it's really--it's a really
weird situation to be in,

15:13.013 --> 15:15.983
and I was very, like,
I was very hurt by it.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.317
- I don't understand.
It didn't, like, click?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.651
You girls are smart girls.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.488
- I feel like, because
all of us are so forgiving

15:21.521 --> 15:22.822
in this group of friends,

15:22.855 --> 15:25.325
and, like, everybody's done
so many crazy things,

15:25.358 --> 15:27.494
and, like, we fight all the time
and all that.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.363
Sometimes it doesn't register.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.166
- I'm not gonna lie. Like, I was
super, super upset about it.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.335
But you guys both
also slept with him too,

15:35.368 --> 15:37.570
so it's, like, added
to the weirdness.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.372
- You guys, can we, like,
seriously though, just like,

15:39.406 --> 15:41.674
acknowledge, like,
how weird this conversation is?

15:41.708 --> 15:43.010
- [laughs]

15:43.010 --> 15:45.678
- My brain literally was
just like, "I don't know."

15:45.712 --> 15:47.014
We all think it's funny,

15:47.014 --> 15:49.282
and, like, who hasn't
seen Jax's dick?

15:49.316 --> 15:54.754
- So yesterday, Tom and Ariana
confronted Lala yesterday.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.556
- What did she say
she was doing instead?

15:56.589 --> 15:58.525
- Well, she said, "I just
couldn't go because of--"

15:58.558 --> 16:00.093
- Of you, right?
- 'Cause of me and Tom.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.929
- My whole reasoning that
I can't stand her obviously is

16:03.030 --> 16:06.199
because of what
she's done to Katie.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.602
But the way that she's went
and talked so badly about him,

16:09.636 --> 16:10.937
that's what drives me
so nuts.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.939
- Honestly, I think
the only person

16:13.040 --> 16:16.143
that can factually screw
Lala over,

16:16.176 --> 16:17.844
and the only thing
that he'll ever be good for

16:17.877 --> 16:20.047
for the rest of his life
is James Kennedy.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.948
- Having them turn
on each other is great.

16:22.049 --> 16:25.052
- I keep hearing
that she's saying that

16:25.085 --> 16:27.154
she doesn't even like James,
she can't even stand James.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.190
And then when someone
showed me her Snapchat

16:30.223 --> 16:32.159
yesterday
or the day before,

16:32.192 --> 16:35.128
he was on Lala's Snapchat,
so they were all hanging out.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.796
So I'm like, "Well,
are y'all really friends,

16:36.829 --> 16:37.964
"or do y'all really
just hate each other

16:38.065 --> 16:39.132
"and you're pretending
to be friends,

16:39.166 --> 16:40.467
'cause neither of you
have friends?"

16:40.500 --> 16:42.669
- That's why I feel like
we should find a way

16:42.702 --> 16:44.837
to sit him down and be like,
"Dude, what's up?"

16:44.871 --> 16:48.175
- I know for a fact
Lala is dating a married man.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.409
But she's been
telling everybody,

16:49.442 --> 16:50.977
oh, she's dating
a football player,

16:51.078 --> 16:52.212
or that she's single.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.746
It's always her word
against mine.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.083
So what we need from James
is proof

16:56.083 --> 16:57.750
that she's
a certified skank.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.587
Okay, I normally never listen
to the podcast ahead of time,

17:00.620 --> 17:02.155
so I'm just gonna play it.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.890
- I don't want to actually
embarrass you right now.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.158
- It's not embarrassing,
I don't care.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.293
- I mean, just in case--
what if it says,

17:06.326 --> 17:07.760
like, yes,
you're a sociopath?

17:07.794 --> 17:09.662
- You know the funniest thing
about this is, after this,

17:09.696 --> 17:12.232
we came home and got drunk
and took the test again.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.767
I even changed my answers,
and it still came out sociopath.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.736
[laughter]

17:16.769 --> 17:19.739
[upbeat music]

17:19.772 --> 17:20.973
*

17:21.007 --> 17:22.809
[doorbell ringing]

17:22.842 --> 17:26.513
*

17:26.546 --> 17:28.315
- What's up with ya?
- What's up, how are you?

17:28.348 --> 17:29.516
- Good. How are you? What, are--
- Mwah.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.817
- Are you reading a book?

17:30.850 --> 17:32.585
- Yeah.
Music knowledge.

17:32.619 --> 17:33.753
- Yeah?
- Come on in.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.323
- Come on in to the library.
- Yeah.

17:36.356 --> 17:40.427
Actually, you want
some ice cream?

17:40.460 --> 17:42.329
- I mean, I'll have ice cream,
but I'm, like,

17:42.362 --> 17:44.431
a grown-ass woman,
so do you have liquor

17:44.464 --> 17:45.698
or anything else
like that?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.534
- I don't.
I haven't drank in a while.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.470
I was the guy that would drink
a lot and start yelling.

17:50.503 --> 17:55.041
But nowadays, the only time
I scream is for ice cream.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.944
It's creamy,
it's delicious.

17:57.977 --> 18:01.548
It's pretty much everything
that you want in your mouth.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.682
Oh, my.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.684
- Yeah, leave it in the freezer
for a while.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.886
You don't have anything
to drink, dude? Nothing?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.421
- I got whiskey that's just been
sitting in the f---ing fridge.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.224
- You won't even take
one little, half a baby shot?

18:11.258 --> 18:13.693
- I mean, I'm like,
just chilling right now.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.295
- What happened?
You used to pop bottles

18:15.328 --> 18:16.763
every time
I f---ing came over here.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.532
Now it's like, "Oh, I'm just
at home hanging out."

18:19.566 --> 18:20.733
Like--
[scoffs]

18:20.767 --> 18:23.803
- I've been working out
a lot, tanning,

18:23.836 --> 18:26.306
getting a lot of music done,
you know?

18:26.339 --> 18:27.540
What have you been doing?

18:27.574 --> 18:30.177
I heard you didn't show up
to the f---ing trip.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.412
What the f---
was that about?

18:32.445 --> 18:33.880
[dramatic music]

18:33.913 --> 18:36.983
- My bag was packed, and
I woke up ready to go at 5:30,

18:37.016 --> 18:40.387
and decided...
I don't want to go anywhere.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.622
- Well, I could've gone,
'cause you didn't, yeah?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.224
That was my ticket.

18:44.257 --> 18:48.728
- You should've gone, 'cause
I'm so far past giving a f---.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.564
It's like...sorry.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.065
- What did you do
in the meantime, though?

18:53.099 --> 18:56.836
- I was with my dog
at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.738
- I see.
- Yeah.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.308
- Who pays for that s---?
- I have a mother.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.210
- Yes, of course my mother's
really paying for it.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.477
- Hmm.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.879
She's a liar.
Your boyfriend is--

19:06.913 --> 19:08.715
your sugar daddy,
and, you know,

19:08.748 --> 19:10.650
I'm not having any of it.
I'm over it.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.220
So you weren't with a guy
at the Beverly Hills Hotel

19:13.220 --> 19:14.554
the whole time?
I'm just trying to grasp that.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.356
'Cause, like, if you were
just sitting there alone,

19:16.389 --> 19:18.225
like, why didn't I
come chill?

19:18.225 --> 19:19.592
You got to stop lying
to your friends

19:19.626 --> 19:21.994
if you want them
to trust you in the long run.

19:22.028 --> 19:25.832
- I think I'm gonna go
with a few people to Malibu

19:25.865 --> 19:28.235
if you guys want to go.
We're gonna, like,

19:28.268 --> 19:30.437
take a helicopter
and s--- like that.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.239
And I think we might
be able to fit you in.

19:32.239 --> 19:35.742
It's gonna be really fun
and super pretty.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.844
Like, the house is
right on the water,

19:37.877 --> 19:40.112
and it has a helicopter
landing pad on the house.

19:40.146 --> 19:42.249
- A helicopter ride.
Who pays for that?

19:42.249 --> 19:44.717
- This is, like,
the only group of people

19:44.751 --> 19:46.052
that have so many questions,
like--

19:46.085 --> 19:47.053
- I'm a guy. All you girls are
the only ones that judge--

19:47.086 --> 19:48.255
- I know.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.790
- Like, that f---ing think
that you're lying.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.259
I'm just a guy, so--

19:52.259 --> 19:55.027
- They're the only girls
that I've ever met in L.A.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.529
where they're like,
"How are you doing this?"

19:56.563 --> 20:00.767
It's like, "Dude, that's
just the way it works in L.A."

20:00.800 --> 20:03.436
For these girls
to live in L.A.--

20:03.470 --> 20:04.804
Sheana her whole life--

20:04.837 --> 20:06.639
and never have been
on a private jet,

20:06.673 --> 20:07.974
it's like,
I don't understand it.

20:08.007 --> 20:12.979
I mean, ask any bitch
who's not ugly with tits.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.981
I don't ask questions.
You just go.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.883
There's a bunch
of f---ing fun people.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.285
That's just L.A.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.487
[dramatic music]

20:20.520 --> 20:23.490
- When you get married, you--
it's a commitment to God.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.824
- All in due time.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.559
We've just been together,
what, now, a year and a month?

20:26.593 --> 20:28.395
- How long are we talking,
do you think?

20:33.199 --> 20:34.033
- * Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah *

20:35.768 --> 20:37.404
- * Peace out, man
- * Yes, you can

20:37.437 --> 20:39.572
* There ain't no madness that

20:39.606 --> 20:41.107
*

20:41.140 --> 20:42.409
- I'm scared.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.243
Oh, my God, if I could just,
like, online shop right now,

20:44.277 --> 20:45.312
that would make me feel
so much better.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.979
Like, my blood pressure would,
like, go down.

20:47.013 --> 20:50.149
- I know, and I'm like,
"Hey, I'm like,

20:50.182 --> 20:52.184
"a step away
from a restraining order,

20:52.218 --> 20:53.920
but thanks
for meeting us."

20:53.953 --> 20:56.356
- Stassi texted James
asking him to meet up with us

20:56.389 --> 20:58.157
under the pretense
that we have

20:58.190 --> 21:00.527
something "important"
to talk to him about.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.330
I'm not looking forward
to seeing James,

21:03.363 --> 21:06.933
but if this means
that I can f--- Lala over,

21:06.966 --> 21:09.836
that is the end goal.
I'll take one for the team.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.439
[playful music]

21:12.472 --> 21:14.006
- Hello.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.042
- [English accent] Hello.
- How are you?

21:16.075 --> 21:17.877
- [English accent]
I'm great, how are you?

21:17.910 --> 21:19.846
- Well, this is awkward. Hello.
- [laughs]

21:19.879 --> 21:22.882
Hello. [laughs]
Oh, s---.

21:22.915 --> 21:25.585
*

21:25.618 --> 21:27.354
- Kristen and Stassi,
you know,

21:27.387 --> 21:28.921
why do they want
to meet up with me?

21:28.955 --> 21:33.393
They either want to gain
some information on me,

21:33.426 --> 21:36.463
find out what my status is
at working at Sur again,

21:36.496 --> 21:39.366
find out why
Lala didn't go to Sonoma,

21:39.366 --> 21:42.602
or want
a threesome with me.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.870
- Okay, so here's
the sitch.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.037
I'm just gonna be
straight up about this.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.374
- Yeah.
- So, Lala's a ho.

21:47.374 --> 21:51.210
She's a bitch, and she
literally terrorizes Katie.

21:51.243 --> 21:54.547
But it seems like you guys
are really close and hang out,

21:54.581 --> 21:57.817
but then...
I know for a fact

21:57.850 --> 22:00.920
that she just does
nothing but talk s--- about you.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.389
She said she does not
like you,

22:02.389 --> 22:04.791
you guys are not friends,
you f--- girls

22:04.824 --> 22:05.958
behind your girlfriend's back.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.160
- Like, no one's ever
told me that before.

22:08.194 --> 22:10.397
- Not Ellie, or not,
like, Tiffany, or not anyone?

22:10.397 --> 22:11.864
- I don't talk
to f---ing Ellie.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.232
- It's not, like, a secret.
- Yeah. It's not, exactly.

22:13.265 --> 22:14.967
- Nobody's being like,
"Don't tell anyone."

22:15.001 --> 22:18.204
- Honestly, it's pretty dumb
for Lala to be f---ing with me

22:18.237 --> 22:20.807
at this point when
she's the one with real s---

22:20.840 --> 22:22.141
to be hiding.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.810
Lala's definitely been
acting, like,

22:23.843 --> 22:25.778
super strange to me
lately.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.246
Like, I've never met
her boyfriend.

22:27.279 --> 22:30.082
- She is f---ing
a married man.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.985
- But he's like, you know,
hooked up a lot of stuff.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.086
- Yeah.
- You know.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.423
- Coachella.
- Hotel rooms, Coachella.

22:36.423 --> 22:37.857
- Coachella,
the two houses.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.692
[dramatic music]

22:39.726 --> 22:42.061
- I was given
this contract.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.062
- Shut the f--- up.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.532
- I don't talk about,
like--

22:45.565 --> 22:47.199
- Confidentiality agreement.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.468
- Yeah.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.005
- Lala's boyfriend
basically rented

22:53.039 --> 22:55.274
this amazing house
for Coachella--

22:55.307 --> 22:58.110
the tickets, food,
alcohol all weekend.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.447
Only catch is that
you have to sign

23:00.447 --> 23:02.582
a f---ing non-disclosure
agreement

23:02.615 --> 23:04.250
which basically states
that I can't

23:04.283 --> 23:07.454
talk about her boyfriend
at all.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.822
- Do you want to read it to me
or are you gonna hog it?

23:09.856 --> 23:11.658
- Social media,
any for of social media--

23:11.691 --> 23:13.626
Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter,
et cetera, newspapers,

23:13.660 --> 23:15.495
magazines, books, newsletters,
websites, chat rooms?

23:15.528 --> 23:17.930
- But does it say his name or
does it just say her boyfriend?

23:17.964 --> 23:20.500
- His name is not on this.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.469
Did you sign an NDA?
- No.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.803
I mean, I guess
she's handing it out

23:23.836 --> 23:27.507
to other people and, like,
telling them to sign it.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.208
I'm sure Tom and Ariana
got one.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.943
- What?

23:30.977 --> 23:32.144
- Because they wouldn't
have been allowed

23:32.178 --> 23:34.313
to stay in the house,
so I would bet my life

23:34.346 --> 23:36.549
that they signed
this NDA.

23:36.583 --> 23:40.520
- I have my suspicions about Tom
and Ariana signing this NDA,

23:40.553 --> 23:45.124
because they never say
a bad word about Lala.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.960
- Here's the thing.
I care about you.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.195
[rhythmic music]

23:49.228 --> 23:51.964
- Dude, Range Rover
gives away cars every year.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.900
- I don't think she was
the winner of the car.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.401
- Her life is none
of y'all's business.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.970
You work with her at Sur,
at a f---ing restaurant.

23:58.004 --> 24:01.307
- They defend and defend
and defend her.

24:01.340 --> 24:02.875
Why?

24:02.909 --> 24:05.578
- Is that all, FBI agents,
'cause I've got work to do.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.379
- This actually has been
great fun.

24:07.413 --> 24:09.315
- Yeah.
[both laughing]

24:09.348 --> 24:10.382
All right, later, guys.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.618
- Thank you...
- Bye-bye.

24:11.651 --> 24:12.919
- For your services.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.320
- [laughs]

24:14.353 --> 24:17.323
[pop music]

24:17.356 --> 24:18.658
*

24:18.691 --> 24:20.392
- Got to hurry up.
We got to get going soon.

24:20.426 --> 24:23.896
*

24:23.930 --> 24:25.832
Mom, you're just sitting
on the couch.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.234
- I hate that I had to take
y'all's bed.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.936
*

24:29.969 --> 24:32.404
- Hey, I slept with you.
I didn't lose my bed.

24:32.438 --> 24:36.342
I'm from a farm in Kentucky,
very religious family.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.410
I am really, really close
to my mom.

24:38.444 --> 24:40.112
I cannot wait for her to see,
like, my life,

24:40.146 --> 24:42.248
and, you know, how things
are different in L.A.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.551
compared to back home
on the farm.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.786
I think Jax just went
to get his car keys,

24:46.819 --> 24:48.354
'cause he lost his keys.

24:48.387 --> 24:50.356
- I hope he's bringing
some coffee.

24:50.389 --> 24:51.758
[both laughing]

24:51.791 --> 24:53.660
- There's a few things
that I don't tell her.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.962
I don't tell her about all
the fights that we have,

24:55.995 --> 24:58.965
and I don't tell her
about how good the sex is.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.133
Oh, wait,
that sounds weird.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.434
We should've went
to the grocery store

25:02.468 --> 25:03.435
instead of Pump.
- I know, like, you

25:03.469 --> 25:04.671
literally have
nothing to eat.

25:04.704 --> 25:07.173
[laughs]
- I know, I'm sorry.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.041
There'll be food
at the bridal shower, though.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.110
- Hey, there he is.
- Hi.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.580
- I'm here.
- Did you bring me some coffee?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.081
- [sighs]
I did not bring coffee.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.183
There's coffee here, no?
There's a Keurig there

25:17.216 --> 25:20.086
that we spent $200 on
that makes coffee.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.854
- Brittany's mom is in town
for a few days,

25:21.888 --> 25:23.355
so--[sighs]

25:23.389 --> 25:24.957
Some things are gonna
have to take a back seat.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.926
- What do you think of the view?
- I love it.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.861
Definitely different from where
I live, but it's awesome.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.063
- A little bit.
A little bit.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.600
No sex, no drinking,
no cursing.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.702
Definitely can't poop
with the door open.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.604
Stassi, Stassi's mom,
Katie,

25:37.604 --> 25:39.271
Katie's mom and grandma.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.607
- Oh, you're gonna meet
all the moms.

25:40.607 --> 25:41.874
- Yeah.
- I wanted to meet your mother.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.275
That's the one
I wanted to meet.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.777
- Maybe she'll come
for the wedding.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.145
- She's all the way in Florida,
though. That's hard.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.146
- She's in Florida.
- Yeah, you guys have to meet.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.380
- I love Florida, too,
so I could

25:48.414 --> 25:49.749
just travel down there.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.050
- Oh, we'll come with you.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.418
'Cause we're eventually
heading down there.

25:52.451 --> 25:54.086
There's no way
in God's green Earth

25:54.120 --> 25:55.254
I'm gonna raise
a family here.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.823
Ev--never,
it's not gonna happen.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.625
- And since we're
on that subject, like,

25:58.625 --> 26:00.627
did you all
ever get into a church?

26:02.094 --> 26:03.062
- A what?

26:03.095 --> 26:04.697
- Did you all ever start
going to church?

26:04.731 --> 26:06.966
- I'm not a big fan of going
to the big churches

26:06.999 --> 26:09.201
where they blow the dust
everywhere, and--

26:09.235 --> 26:11.003
- Blow the dust everywhere?
What are you talking about?

26:11.037 --> 26:13.372
- Well, they have--they have
the big organs playing,

26:13.405 --> 26:16.508
and the priest comes down
and starts waving dust around.

26:16.542 --> 26:20.379
I just can't relate to it,
to millions of years ago.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.881
- Mm-hmm.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.482
You need to come to my church
in Kentucky.

26:23.515 --> 26:25.985
I go to a Pentecostal church.
- Yeah.

26:26.018 --> 26:28.087
- Pentecostal?
What the hell is that?

26:28.120 --> 26:31.323
I've never heard of that.
Sounds like--sounds like a cult.

26:31.357 --> 26:35.394
- When you get married,
it's a commitment to your wife.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.996
It's also a commitment
to God.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.665
- All in due time.
We've just been together,

26:38.698 --> 26:40.066
what now,
a year and a month?

26:40.099 --> 26:43.002
- How long are we talking,
do you think?

26:43.035 --> 26:46.072
[upbeat music]

26:46.105 --> 26:48.007
*

26:48.040 --> 26:50.009
- Wait, how much did you spend
on the Taco Bell?

26:50.042 --> 26:51.010
- Oh, my God, it's hot.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.511
- Don't ask questions.

26:52.544 --> 26:55.682
- For Katie's bridal shower,
we've decided to rent,

26:55.682 --> 26:57.684
basically this,
like, mansion.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.887
We want it to be fancy
and special,

27:00.920 --> 27:03.522
so if we have to spend
a little extra money,

27:03.555 --> 27:04.523
that's fine.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.092
We want it to be
perfect for her.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.459
- I have a million things
outside.

27:07.493 --> 27:09.696
- I'm glad you remembered.
- It's so heavy.

27:09.696 --> 27:12.965
- Katie's wedding is
so important to me.

27:12.999 --> 27:16.468
I'm willing to put things
in my life on hold.

27:16.502 --> 27:19.972
I am here to make sure that
her life is so much easier.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.174
That's planning
the bridal shower,

27:22.208 --> 27:23.776
the bachelorette party.

27:23.810 --> 27:27.780
If she needs me to pick up
her dry cleaning, I'll do it.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.282
Katie's really lucky. She has
a lot of personal assistants.

27:30.316 --> 27:33.052
- Everyone gets a bottle
of tequila when they leave.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.721
I'm really excited
for this bridal shower.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.790
I mean, I wish I knew
how much it was costing.

27:37.824 --> 27:41.794
- This is beautiful.
It's like a dream come true.

27:41.828 --> 27:45.832
- Like, who spends
$200 at Taco Bell?

27:45.865 --> 27:46.966
I didn't even know
that was possible.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.135
- I'm gonna eat something
right now,

27:49.168 --> 27:50.136
'cause I haven't
eaten today.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.139
[playful music]

27:53.172 --> 27:54.573
*

27:54.606 --> 27:55.742
- Kristen, I'm really glad
you're here right now,

27:55.742 --> 27:56.743
'cause I've waiting
to tell Scheana.

27:56.776 --> 27:57.744
- What?

27:57.777 --> 27:58.911
- We met with James
yesterday.

27:58.945 --> 27:59.979
- What?

28:00.012 --> 28:02.982
- Lala gave him
an NDA to sign.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.650
- [gasps]

28:04.751 --> 28:06.285
But he said
he hasn't signed it.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.420
- Yeah, but now I want
to know who's signed it.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.756
Tom and Ariana never--

28:09.756 --> 28:11.323
they always refuse
to talk about Lala.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.760
They're always like,
"That's not true, I don't know."

28:13.793 --> 28:16.896
- They wouldn't have signed one.
No way.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.965
- They were at Coachella.
I just feel like I want to ask.

28:18.998 --> 28:19.966
- Right.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.801
*

28:22.835 --> 28:23.803
- I like him.

28:23.836 --> 28:26.072
- Enough for her
to marry him?

28:26.105 --> 28:27.907
Yeah, I want to wish you
luck with that.

28:33.846 --> 28:34.380
- * Take me outta here

28:35.782 --> 28:37.784
* Don't want to hang around

28:37.784 --> 28:39.418
* Let's take off

28:41.087 --> 28:41.687
- Where's the Hollywood sign at?

28:43.122 --> 28:46.192
- Oh, come on, I think
we'll see it up here.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.527
- And Rodeo Drive,
where's that?

28:48.560 --> 28:49.628
- I'll take you there.

28:49.661 --> 28:51.864
- Yeah, I want to go
down Rodeo Drive.

28:51.898 --> 28:56.869
- Bridal shower, here we go.
Maybe one day we'll have one.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.304
- I mean, you would
really get me upset,

28:58.337 --> 29:00.672
like, if you brought,
you know, Brittany down here,

29:00.706 --> 29:03.209
and it's years and years go by,
and, you know--

29:03.242 --> 29:04.343
- Oh, no, I'm not gonna
waste anybody's time.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.245
- And yet you've taken her
out of Kentucky.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.547
You've tooken her
away from all of her family.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.349
- Times are different.
It's 2016.

29:10.382 --> 29:13.185
It's not 1970,
it's not the '60s where it's--

29:13.219 --> 29:14.520
it's not like that
anymore.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.122
- You are not in a great mood,
are you, Jax?

29:16.155 --> 29:18.257
- No, I'm not.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.391
- It really would
mean a lot

29:19.425 --> 29:22.261
if Jax would answer
my mom directly.

29:22.294 --> 29:25.031
Just let her know
that you didn't waste my time

29:25.064 --> 29:26.732
and move me
from Kentucky to L.A.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.400
Just let her know
that you do plan

29:28.434 --> 29:30.536
on having a family
and being married.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.438
You say you do,
but don't beat around the bush

29:32.471 --> 29:33.739
when my mom is asking.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.141
- Look at Goldie Hawn
and Kurt Russell.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.542
They have kids
and everything.

29:36.575 --> 29:38.544
They never got married.
They've been together.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.646
They're happy,
everybody has kids.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.181
Why do you have to haul
marriage in there?

29:42.214 --> 29:43.549
[dramatic music]

29:43.582 --> 29:45.751
- Times a-tickin' for you.
No. [laughs]

29:45.852 --> 29:48.220
- I'm getting a little pressure
from Brittany's mom.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.488
I don't know
if I'm ready tomorrow.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.223
I don't know if I'm ready
in six months.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.192
I don't know
if I'm ready next year.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.726
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:54.760 --> 29:58.097
I had to make
some color decisions.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.866
- I love that.
- Hey, thanks.

29:59.866 --> 30:02.401
- That's so cute.
- Thank you.

30:02.434 --> 30:05.237
- Ariana's milking
this groomsmen situation

30:05.271 --> 30:06.372
for all it's worth.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.607
- I think I want you
to officially be a groomsman.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.144
- Oh, my God!
That's so cool.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.745
- She does
whatever she wants.

30:13.779 --> 30:15.414
If she wants to go hang out
with the boys,

30:15.447 --> 30:16.748
she goes and does that.

30:16.782 --> 30:17.917
Now she wants to come
and hang out

30:17.950 --> 30:19.451
with all of the bridesmaids.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.021
Katie didn't want you here.
She didn't want you here 0%,

30:22.054 --> 30:23.856
and you're here 100%.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.691
- There's either
a steep driveway,

30:25.724 --> 30:29.261
or little--big steps.
Grandma?

30:29.295 --> 30:32.364
- Yeah, I could use
the stairs, yeah.

30:32.398 --> 30:33.432
- They're coming.
They're coming.

30:33.465 --> 30:34.433
- [whispering]
Wait, wait.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.534
[dramatic music]

30:35.567 --> 30:38.470
- Hi.
[cheers and applause]

30:38.504 --> 30:40.439
- Oh, my God!

30:40.472 --> 30:43.342
[laughter]
- You look so sweetie!

30:43.375 --> 30:44.543
[upbeat music]

30:44.576 --> 30:45.844
- Hi!
- Thank you.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.713
- Hi!
- Mmm.

30:47.746 --> 30:48.780
- [squeals]

30:48.814 --> 30:51.450
- My bridesmaids
have killed it.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.352
I mean,
this house is gorgeous.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.787
There's all my friends
and family who I love.

30:55.821 --> 30:57.623
- Hi.
- Cheers.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.491
- There's cocktails.

30:59.525 --> 31:03.462
And I cannot wait to be
Mrs. Bubba Schwartz.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.463
[dramatic music]

31:04.496 --> 31:05.697
- "Mrs. Bubba."

31:05.731 --> 31:08.300
- You look so beautiful.
It's the perfect outfit.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.936
Even your nails
look good with it.

31:09.936 --> 31:11.137
- I painted them
on the way here.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.304
- No way.
- [laughs]

31:12.338 --> 31:14.573
- Hello.

31:14.606 --> 31:17.376
- Hi!
- Lordy!

31:17.409 --> 31:20.546
- Lisa's been instrumental
and supportive

31:20.579 --> 31:22.381
with Tom and I
and our relationship,

31:22.414 --> 31:24.050
so for her
to be here today

31:24.083 --> 31:25.384
and be able
to take part in this,

31:25.417 --> 31:27.086
it means the world to me.

31:27.119 --> 31:29.055
- Taco Bell!
- Taco Bell! [indistinct]!

31:29.088 --> 31:30.322
- [gasps]
[laughter]

31:30.356 --> 31:33.159
Oh, my God.
I could cry.

31:33.192 --> 31:37.229
Taco Bell
motherf---ing tower!

31:37.263 --> 31:39.298
- Mini rosé tequila bottles.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.100
I get a little tequila Katie
to take home.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.635
- Do they need also to be,
like, verbally accosted too,

31:43.669 --> 31:44.636
on the way out?
- Probably.

31:44.670 --> 31:45.637
- All right.
- Yeah.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.239
[both laughing]

31:47.273 --> 31:50.242
[upbeat music]

31:50.276 --> 31:55.114
*

31:55.147 --> 31:57.984
- Good old El Coyote.
This place never dies.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.351
- Welcome to El Coyote.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.087
- Hi. Thank you.
We love it here.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.521
- Would you like
something to drink?

32:02.554 --> 32:04.023
- Four shots of [indistinct].

32:04.056 --> 32:05.457
- Whoo!
- Boom.

32:05.491 --> 32:06.558
- Four shots of [indistinct].
- Ah, let's go, everybody!

32:06.592 --> 32:07.559
- Let's do it.
- [laughs]

32:07.593 --> 32:08.560
- All right,
let's do it.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.496
- Had to drive the girls
to Eagle Rock.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.264
The whole ride there,
Brittany's mom,

32:12.298 --> 32:14.700
"So when am I getting
grandkids?

32:14.733 --> 32:16.402
When are you gonna
tie the knot?"

32:16.435 --> 32:19.338
- Ew. My parents would
never say that s---.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.073
- This is too much pressure
for Jax.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.574
He's gonna, like, say
he's got to run to the store

32:22.608 --> 32:23.709
and grab some stuff,

32:23.742 --> 32:25.211
and he's gonna
keep on going, man.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.079
We'll never see him again,
until, like,

32:27.113 --> 32:30.416
his mugshots pop up
on, like, the news or something.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.850
[dramatic music]

32:31.883 --> 32:33.885
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi, honey.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.587
- I wanted you
to meet my mother.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.689
- Oh, oh, I'd love
to meet your mother.

32:37.723 --> 32:40.026
- Yeah, this is my mom.
She just got her last night.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.193
- Oh, well, oh, hi.
- Hello, hi.

32:41.227 --> 32:42.861
- How nice to meet you.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.463
- So nice to meet you.
My name's Sherri.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.298
- Wow, yeah.
Hi, Sherri.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.699
- [laughs]

32:47.733 --> 32:50.536
Can't believe you're all
in the same apartment.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.704
How well do you
know Jax then?

32:52.738 --> 32:55.474
- Well, he's been down
the country a couple times, so--

32:55.507 --> 32:57.109
- He's actually been
all the way to Kentucky?

32:57.143 --> 32:58.377
- Yes, twice.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.713
s- And how did Kentucky
receive Jax Taylor?

33:01.747 --> 33:03.282
- I don't want to get
pecked by chickens.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.450
I don't. I just don't.
- [laughs]

33:04.483 --> 33:05.884
- Look at those f---ing--
- Come on, like,

33:05.917 --> 33:07.453
they're all the way over here.
- [gasping]

33:07.486 --> 33:08.854
- [laughs] You're--
- [gasping]

33:08.887 --> 33:09.855
- I like him.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.290
- Enough for her
to marry him?

33:11.323 --> 33:15.627
*

33:15.661 --> 33:18.797
- She wants Brittany
to marry Jax?

33:18.830 --> 33:21.633
Has she met
the real Mr. Jax Taylor?

33:21.667 --> 33:23.069
- When you're dating
a girl from the South,

33:23.069 --> 33:25.804
they expect you to have kids
and marriage by 22 years old.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.639
- I don't care. She has
to understand where you're from.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.141
- Exactly, which is hell.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.209
[laughter]

33:30.242 --> 33:31.810
- I want to get Jax
into church.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.145
- Got to get him
out of jail first.

33:33.179 --> 33:34.513
I mean, he's a bad dog.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.648
I mean, like, he does not
belong in church yet.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.584
*

33:38.617 --> 33:40.186
- "So what church
do you guys belong to?"

33:40.219 --> 33:41.820
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God.

33:41.853 --> 33:42.921
- That's my worst nightmare.
- You should've said

33:42.954 --> 33:44.323
the Church of Scientology.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.493
[laughter]

33:47.526 --> 33:48.994
- He's got a good soul,

33:49.095 --> 33:53.332
he just gets a little bit lost
in his direction sometimes.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.001
I just hope he doesn't
break your heart.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.336
- If he breaks my heart,
I'm gonna

33:57.369 --> 33:59.238
break his--[inaudible]
- [laughs]

33:59.271 --> 34:00.939
- Why don't they put that
in their wedding vows?

34:00.972 --> 34:02.241
[Southern accent]
"If you break my heart,

34:02.274 --> 34:04.610
I'll break your dick."
There you go.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.945
You're a braver woman
than I am, that's for sure.

34:06.978 --> 34:08.314
- It will be fine,
I promise.

34:08.347 --> 34:11.016
- Really? I want to wish you
luck with that.

34:11.117 --> 34:14.353
*

34:15.654 --> 34:17.589
- Actually, I don't get
in fights with my friends.

34:17.623 --> 34:18.590
- Then I don't understand
what you're doing.

34:18.624 --> 34:19.925
- Because I care
about Katie.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.334
- Seven days
make seven nights *

34:32.037 --> 34:34.005
* It's still nowhere to frown

34:34.039 --> 34:36.375
* The one who claims that

34:36.408 --> 34:38.844
- Thank you all
very, very much for being here.

34:38.877 --> 34:43.515
It's just so, so very special,
and I thank you so very much.

34:43.549 --> 34:46.185
And Lisa, you were there,
and you gave her the love

34:46.218 --> 34:49.588
and support that she needed,
so I am so grateful for you.

34:49.621 --> 34:50.922
- Because I love her too.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.758
I don't love her as much
as you do, but I love her.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.793
[laughter]

34:54.826 --> 34:56.428
I love her,
and you know what?

34:56.462 --> 34:57.763
She's a credit to you.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.030
- Thank you
so very much.

34:59.064 --> 35:01.867
[dramatic music]

35:01.900 --> 35:03.202
- What if you just took off
and said, "Listen,

35:03.235 --> 35:04.870
"I'm out of here.
I'm going back to Minnesota.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.172
"No, I'm gonna change
my phone.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.374
No one will find me."
What if you did that?

35:08.407 --> 35:09.775
- Are you guys all in?

35:09.808 --> 35:11.177
You guys both agree to break up
with your girlfriends,

35:11.210 --> 35:12.778
I'll call the f---ing wedding
off right now.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.680
No, no, I'm kidding.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.215
I just don't like
the concept of marriage,

35:16.248 --> 35:18.317
but I'm-I just--
I want to see Katie happy,

35:18.350 --> 35:21.019
so we're getting--
you know, getting married.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.657
- So, this is
your something new.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.193
- Oh, my God!

35:27.193 --> 35:29.328
- Blue?
- So I got you something old

35:29.361 --> 35:30.496
and something blue,

35:30.529 --> 35:32.898
but they both
just ended up being blue.

35:32.931 --> 35:35.201
- I should've just waited
to, like, break up with Patrick

35:35.234 --> 35:36.635
until, like,
after the wedding,

35:36.668 --> 35:38.970
so I wouldn't have to,
like, deal with this s---.

35:39.004 --> 35:40.472
I'm gonna be alone
forever.

35:40.506 --> 35:41.973
- How does this go?

35:42.007 --> 35:44.210
Oh, no, it's this way,
it's this way.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.977
See, this is why
I don't wear lingerie.

35:46.011 --> 35:48.214
- It's inside out, though,
regardless.

35:48.214 --> 35:50.081
- Okay, it's inside out.
[laughter]

35:50.115 --> 35:51.750
- How's that
$500 flower budget going?

35:51.783 --> 35:53.985
- Yeah, how is that?
- How much has it inflated to?

35:54.019 --> 35:55.487
- How much were you
expecting to spend?

35:55.521 --> 35:56.355
- 15 grand.

35:56.388 --> 35:58.023
- 15 grand?

35:58.056 --> 35:59.891
- At a certain point you
just learn it's not worth it

35:59.925 --> 36:01.327
to challenge
your significant other.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.061
You see those guys
who are, like, 50, 60,

36:03.094 --> 36:05.431
and they go, "Listen,
happy wife, happy life.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.832
The woman's always right."

36:06.865 --> 36:08.900
They've been brainwashed
over the course of many years.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.001
I'm almost there.

36:10.035 --> 36:11.403
- This, I thought,
would help you out.

36:11.437 --> 36:12.638
Because I know,
you know, listen,

36:12.671 --> 36:14.506
I've been married
35 years this year.

36:14.540 --> 36:18.009
So I know,
sometimes it can be tedious.

36:18.043 --> 36:23.482
I heard there was this lady,
that her name was Katie.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.083
- Oh, my God,
a blow-up doll!

36:25.116 --> 36:27.419
[all cheering and laughing]

36:27.453 --> 36:28.620
- Oh, my God!

36:28.654 --> 36:31.257
Like, it's one of those
blow-up dolls.

36:31.290 --> 36:34.260
- Oh, my God.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.995
- She has a tight,
realistic ass.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.365
But you know what's even better,
and that Schwartz will prove it,

36:39.398 --> 36:41.700
it's kind of like a mix
between me and you, right?

36:41.733 --> 36:43.802
all: Oh!

36:43.835 --> 36:46.438
- Schwartzy can shag
this blow-up doll

36:46.472 --> 36:48.106
without any guilt
whatsoever.

36:48.139 --> 36:49.775
I mean,
it's bloody called Katie.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.510
I mean,
how wrong could that be?

36:51.543 --> 36:52.844
- How's it feel?

36:52.878 --> 36:54.480
- Have you ever met
a guy like this, who said this?

36:54.513 --> 36:57.283
"God, I'm so happy
I got married."

36:57.316 --> 37:00.619
No! They do this.
"Don't do it, don't."

37:00.652 --> 37:03.188
Here's to saving
a lot of money on marriage.

37:03.289 --> 37:05.624
- Here's to marriage being
the best new thing in my life.

37:05.657 --> 37:06.858
- Oh, my God.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.561
Talk to me in a year.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.430
- How was your flight?
- It was great.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.299
- You guys are,
like, literally twins.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.900
I've seen so many photos
of you, but...

37:14.933 --> 37:17.035
- [laughs]
- Spitting image.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.571
- I don't think you know,
but do you know

37:19.605 --> 37:21.773
what I found out about
yesterday?

37:21.807 --> 37:23.208
Kris and I met with James.

37:23.309 --> 37:24.410
- Why?

37:24.443 --> 37:28.314
- He did give
some interesting information.

37:28.314 --> 37:30.749
- So we all heard that
there was an NDA at Coachella,

37:30.782 --> 37:32.451
like a contract,
okay, whatever,

37:32.484 --> 37:34.219
you can't talk
about her boyfriend.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.721
That's what we all heard.

37:35.754 --> 37:36.888
[dramatic music]

37:36.922 --> 37:38.790
- Yeah, no one was
at the house I stayed at.

37:38.824 --> 37:39.991
- Are you still gonna,
like, pretend

37:40.025 --> 37:42.160
that this guy
wasn't there?

37:42.193 --> 37:45.564
- I saw Lala when we
first got there, said hey.

37:45.597 --> 37:49.067
No, I never saw
anybody come by.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.837
Nothing.
I knew it was paid for.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.339
I don't know by who.

37:53.372 --> 37:56.808
- There's no way that I ever
read through a piece of paper,

37:56.842 --> 37:59.445
saw that I wasn't allowed
to talk about Lala,

37:59.478 --> 38:01.647
and then signed it
at the bottom.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.349
I didn't sign
an NDA for Coachella.

38:03.382 --> 38:04.650
- Yes, you did!

38:04.683 --> 38:07.986
Ariana is displaying
the telltale signs of lying.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.821
She's choking
on her words.

38:09.855 --> 38:12.358
She won't make eye contact
and keeps looking away,

38:12.391 --> 38:14.360
and she's, like,
all fidgety and stuff.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.428
- I would not sign
an NDA for s---.

38:16.462 --> 38:19.365
- I think it's kind of f---ed up
what she's done to a home.

38:19.365 --> 38:21.367
It's not really,
like, all that nice.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.668
- Well, what about the guy?

38:22.701 --> 38:24.836
- You saying that is
defending her, right there.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.105
- Lala, who you had known him
for about five f---ing minutes,

38:27.138 --> 38:28.874
and you've known me
for how long?

38:28.907 --> 38:30.842
That you are actually letting--
like,

38:30.876 --> 38:33.379
you're just being like,
"Well, I mean, yeah.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.246
Oh, well."
I don't understand it.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.015
It doesn't add up
in my head.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.684
- You've said stuff about her,
too, though.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.686
- You were saying that
your only regret in life

38:40.719 --> 38:43.188
is not taking your top off more
in front of Tom Schwartz.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.724
"I want to f--- him."
It's like, really?

38:45.757 --> 38:47.393
- Ariana, she's gonna be
in my wedding.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.395
She's here
at my bridal shower.

38:49.395 --> 38:52.398
Lala has fat-shamed me,

38:52.431 --> 38:55.534
said she wanted
to f--- my boyfriend.

38:55.567 --> 38:58.870
She ditched Ariana
on her birthday, so why the f---

38:58.904 --> 39:01.540
is Ariana still defending her,
especially to me?

39:01.573 --> 39:04.275
Really, I mean, I know
you can argue that Kristen

39:04.309 --> 39:05.411
has said unsavory things
about you.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.446
- I could argue that
till the cows come home.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.047
- But that's a very real--but
that is a very different thing.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.016
- But that's so different.
It's apples and oranges.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.553
- That is so beyond delusional
for you to even think or say.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.122
- The idea that Kristen and I
have done

39:17.155 --> 39:21.460
"equally bad things"
to each other is a f---ing joke.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.429
- If I was in a long term
relationship with somebody,

39:23.429 --> 39:26.632
and I was worried about him
with one girl for years.

39:26.665 --> 39:27.799
- We're not talking
about that.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.034
- Then what are you
talking about?

39:29.067 --> 39:30.702
- We're talking about everything
that happened

39:30.736 --> 39:32.538
from the beginning
to the end.

39:32.571 --> 39:34.840
We're not talking
about one f---ing thing.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.875
- We're talking about what
you're guilty of.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.309
- That's one thing.
I'm talking about--

39:38.343 --> 39:40.311
- Okay,
but it's a major thing.

39:40.345 --> 39:41.312
- Do you want to go
through the whole list?

39:41.346 --> 39:42.714
- You only want to talk
about her sh--,

39:42.748 --> 39:43.715
but not what you've done.
- You want to talk about her

39:43.749 --> 39:44.850
f---ing treating Scheana
like s---,

39:44.883 --> 39:46.852
treating Katie like s---,
that's cool?

39:46.885 --> 39:48.820
Okay.
Okay.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.221
You know, she said
some really f---ed up s---

39:50.255 --> 39:51.557
about Scheana before.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.659
- Ariana can't take
responsibility for anything.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.227
She doesn't care that
she stole Kristen's boyfriend.

39:56.261 --> 39:58.897
She doesn't care that Lala's
dating a married man.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.198
And she sure as hell
doesn't care that

40:00.231 --> 40:01.867
she's ruining
Katie's bridal shower.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.836
- Okay, if you're gonna
compare that,

40:04.870 --> 40:06.572
that's pretty f---ing wrong.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.173
All right. I--it's
my f---ing bridal shower.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.174
I don't need to be
upset about it.

40:09.207 --> 40:10.375
- I'm just, like--

40:15.046 --> 40:15.413
[dramatic music]

40:16.682 --> 40:18.283
- I don't agree
with what Lala said.

40:18.316 --> 40:20.351
I don't think it's right.
I don't think it's cool.

40:20.385 --> 40:22.020
But honestly,
I'm not gonna sit here

40:22.053 --> 40:24.656
and f---ing lay down
in front of a truck

40:24.690 --> 40:26.492
because of some dumb s---
she said.

40:26.525 --> 40:29.160
It's not that serious.
It's really not.

40:29.194 --> 40:30.629
- It is when it's hurt
somebody.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.964
- I'm not trying
to be involved in, like,

40:32.998 --> 40:34.833
a group of friends that,
like, that fight like that.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.301
- Then don't.

40:36.334 --> 40:37.603
- I do understand
what she's saying,

40:37.636 --> 40:38.804
and I said the same thing.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.506
The three of you drink,
and the way you fight,

40:40.539 --> 40:41.673
it's like sisters,
and you fight.

40:41.707 --> 40:43.108
- We've all got
in major fights

40:43.141 --> 40:44.610
where we haven't spoken
for sometimes years at a time.

40:44.643 --> 40:47.946
- No, actually--actually I don't
get in fights with my friends.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.147
I never did.
- Don't be here.

40:49.180 --> 40:50.448
Then I don't understand
what you're doing.

40:50.482 --> 40:51.483
- Because I care about Katie.
- Because she loves me.

40:51.517 --> 40:52.984
I don't give a f---
about you.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.554
[suspenseful music]

40:55.587 --> 40:56.822
- That's so rude.

40:56.855 --> 40:59.958
- I don't really give a f---.
I'm sorry.

40:59.991 --> 41:03.028
*

41:03.061 --> 41:04.863
- 'Kay, 'kay.

41:04.896 --> 41:10.135
*

41:10.168 --> 41:12.871
- Still to come on this season
of "Vanderpump Rules."

41:12.904 --> 41:14.039
I can't believe it,
really.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.206
They're all growing up,
aren't they?

41:15.240 --> 41:16.274
[techno music]

41:16.307 --> 41:19.210
- Make it rain, Katie!
- Oh!

41:19.244 --> 41:20.211
Whoo!

41:20.245 --> 41:21.246
*

41:21.279 --> 41:23.048
- Oh!
[laughter]

41:23.081 --> 41:25.050
*

41:25.083 --> 41:26.718
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.554
[all cheering]

41:28.554 --> 41:30.388
- How are you getting on
with Stassi?

41:30.421 --> 41:33.091
- She likes to try to tell
people how to live their lives.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.794
- You hurt my feelings,
like, three times tonight.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.095
- You're asserting
your opinion

41:37.128 --> 41:39.898
as if I should be
listening to it.

41:39.931 --> 41:41.733
- I did not ask Ariana
to be a bridesmaid

41:41.767 --> 41:43.134
for a f---ing reason.

41:43.168 --> 41:44.736
- Are you faithful to me?

41:44.770 --> 41:47.105
- Yes.
Yes, I'm faithful to you.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.176
[glass breaking]

41:51.209 --> 41:52.443
[dramatic music]

41:52.477 --> 41:54.279
- You're all f---ing losers!

41:54.312 --> 41:59.084
- He's slept with many,
many, many women.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.418
And a few men.

42:00.451 --> 42:03.054
- There's a rumor about you
being a homosexual.

42:03.088 --> 42:04.990
- Well, I'm gonna go.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.157
[door slams]

42:06.191 --> 42:07.826
- You don't understand
what you've done!

42:07.859 --> 42:09.895
- I was a cheater,
I was a liar, I was a stealer.

42:09.928 --> 42:11.997
I was everything.
I'm sorry.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.865
- Don't ever have that
kind of emotions toward me.

42:13.899 --> 42:16.668
It was really awkward
and it really made me sad.

42:16.702 --> 42:19.705
- This is a day that
we've all been waiting for.

42:19.738 --> 42:22.908
- Well, Katie's also been
using her wedding as a--

42:22.941 --> 42:23.942
- As leverage.

42:23.975 --> 42:25.276
- The only thing
that's impossible is

42:25.310 --> 42:26.511
how you still haven't
f---ing figured this out.

42:26.612 --> 42:28.780
- We've all seen
the wrath of Tequila Katie.

42:28.814 --> 42:30.916
- It's vicious.
- Yeah.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.618
- I don't want to sit
in a car with you again.

42:32.618 --> 42:35.286
- She's mean and aggressive,
and irrational

42:35.320 --> 42:37.122
and sends me
all of these mean messages.

42:37.155 --> 42:38.957
- Here come the rage taxes.

42:38.990 --> 42:41.693
- You could lose each other
if you keep going with Derek.

42:41.727 --> 42:44.062
- He's a f---ing
battered wife!

42:44.095 --> 42:45.430
Look at him!

42:45.463 --> 42:48.199
- My fiancé cheated on me.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.367
- Get over it!

42:49.400 --> 42:50.702
- It really has worried me

42:50.736 --> 42:52.403
that you're making
the right decision.

42:52.437 --> 42:54.873
What the f--- is
going on here?
