00:43.177 --> 00:45.377

00:46.847 --> 00:48.246
The answer is...

00:48.248 --> 00:51.449
46.2g's.

00:51.451 --> 00:57.522
In 1954,
john stapp experienced 46.2g's

00:57.524 --> 00:58.991
And survived.

00:58.993 --> 01:02.461
He was participating
in an air force experiment

01:02.463 --> 01:04.863

to a rocket sled

In the mojave desert.

On that particular run,

Stapp went faster than expected,

01:15.676 --> 01:18.610
They were certain
they'd find him dead.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.613

Every single blood vessel
in his eyes had burst,

01:24.819 --> 01:28.953
But incredibly
not the eyes themselves.

01:28.955 --> 01:31.824
And eventually,
he regained his sight

01:31.826 --> 01:34.426
And proof that humans
were more durable

01:34.428 --> 01:37.562

They asked for a ride because
mike can't drive right now.
