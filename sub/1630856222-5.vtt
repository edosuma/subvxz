My father took risks
by buying paintings from artists

that no one heard of
and no one liked.

10:02.669 --> 10:05.605
I watched my dad take risks
as an entrepreneur,

10:05.605 --> 10:06.706
which paid off for him,

is primarily sales.

I was a real-estate agent,

10:21.688 --> 10:22.956
and at night
I was producing theater.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.991
I got together with
a group called Malaparte,

and I had this amazing group

10:27.727 --> 10:29.829

at a very young age.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.097

in entertainment

10:31.097 --> 10:33.700
was working as vice president
of acquisitions

10:33.700 --> 10:34.801
for Arrow Entertainment.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.570
In 1996,
I went to the big leagues,

10:37.570 --> 10:38.571
which is Miramax.

10:38.571 --> 10:39.906
When I got to my late 20s,

I started my own company,
but after two and a half years,

10:42.075 --> 10:44.010
that company completely
went down the tubes.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.845
I almost went to go work
for somebody else.

10:45.845 --> 10:46.913
But something in me says,

10:46.913 --> 10:48.548
"You have to do this
on your own,"

10:48.548 --> 10:49.782
and out of the sky,

10:49.782 --> 10:51.784
I got a first-look deal
at Paramount.

10:51.784 --> 10:53.887
I got money to keep
my company running,

10:53.887 --> 10:57.023
and that was really
the beginning of Blumhouse.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.659
"Paranormal Activity" was
the movie that changed my life.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.694
Every studio had passed
on the movie,

11:01.694 --> 11:02.929
and I called the filmmaker,
and I said,

11:02.929 --> 11:05.064
"Let me try and get this movie
into movie theaters.

11:05.064 --> 11:09.035
And if you make anything over
$500,000, I want X percent."

11:09.035 --> 11:10.770
The budget of
"Paranormal Activity"

11:10.770 --> 11:11.971
was $15,000,

11:11.971 --> 11:15.508
and the movie wound up
grossing $193 million.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.109
We made six

11:16.109 --> 11:17.944
"Paranormal Activity" movies
after that.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.680
The total worldwide gross
of all seven movies

11:20.680 --> 11:22.015
is approaching $1 billion.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.184
What "Paranormal Activity"
did for me was teach me

11:24.184 --> 11:26.853
that there was a way
to make independent movies

11:26.853 --> 11:28.988
that could be
incredibly lucrative,

11:28.988 --> 11:30.757
and the way we do that
is we make

11:30.757 --> 11:32.125
very, very low-budgeted movies,

11:32.125 --> 11:34.794
and we own a big piece
of the revenue

11:34.794 --> 11:36.129
because we've worked
for nothing up front.

11:36.129 --> 11:39.032
We and the director and the
actors don't get paid up front.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.134
If the movies work,
everyone does very, very well,

11:41.134 --> 11:42.969
and if they don't,
no one gets too hurt

11:42.969 --> 11:44.037
because the movies didn't cost

11:44.037 --> 11:45.638
very much money
in the first place.

11:45.638 --> 11:46.739
It was a new model.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.942
It was a different approach
to making movies.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.143
One of the proudest moments
I had

11:50.143 --> 11:53.746
was when Harvard asked to do
a case study on Blumhouse.

11:53.746 --> 11:54.948
When we did that case study,

11:54.948 --> 11:57.750
we had 13 of the top 25

11:57.750 --> 11:59.986
most profitable movies
ever made.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.021
Can we get like 10%
out of the budget?

12:02.021 --> 12:03.957
Blumhouse is
a multimedia company.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.059
We do massive
horror franchises --

12:06.059 --> 12:08.761
"The Exorcist,"
"Halloween," "M3GAN."

12:08.761 --> 12:11.331
We've been able to reach
outside of horror --

12:11.331 --> 12:14.067
"Whiplash," for which we were
nominated for an Academy Award.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.835
We were nominated
for Best Picture

12:15.835 --> 12:16.936
for "BlacKkKlansman,"

12:16.936 --> 12:19.606
the ultimate horror movie,
"Get Out."

12:19.606 --> 12:20.807
I'm always afraid of failure,

12:20.807 --> 12:23.610

an entrepreneur and not fail.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.082
It's an incredibly
important show

12:29.082 --> 12:31.150

almost watch "Shark Tank"

they watch the Academy Awards.

through the numbers.

What do you sell it for?
Yes.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.085
What's the wholesale price
to retail?

18:06.085 --> 18:09.088
So we make it
between $1.60 and $2.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.990

direct to consumer

between $3.90 and $4,

customers between $6 to $7.

putting profits
before anything else,

25:56.955 --> 26:00.659
So, Sharks, who wants to
get pumped up with us and...

26:00.659 --> 26:02.094
Together:
...pumpkin like a pro?

26:02.094 --> 26:06.565
So how would you guys release
my pumpkin-carving potential?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.667
Well, we've been
teaching art

26:08.667 --> 26:11.570
for over a decade
in various forms.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.906
Our courses will get you
through the steps

26:13.906 --> 26:16.008
to carve something that
you're really proud of.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.811
And even if your first one
is not a masterpiece,

26:18.811 --> 26:20.112
we're still gonna help you
get away

26:20.112 --> 26:23.515
from the classic jack-o'-lantern
that you've done in the past

26:23.515 --> 26:24.650
and do something really fun.

26:24.650 --> 26:27.186
Tell us about the business.
What are we buying into?

26:27.186 --> 26:30.756
And what is the tangible thing
that the consumer is buying?

26:30.756 --> 26:32.024
The last three years

26:32.024 --> 26:35.027
were a real game-changer
in our business,

26:35.027 --> 26:39.631
which a lot of it depended on
live, in-person events.

26:39.631 --> 26:40.799
And with the pandemic,

26:40.799 --> 26:43.936
we immediately transitioned
to doing online classes,

26:43.936 --> 26:46.438
online events
and demonstrations.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.539
Are you making any money?

26:47.539 --> 26:48.841
In the last three years,

26:48.841 --> 26:53.812
we sold over $170,000 worth
of virtual-class experiences...

26:53.812 --> 26:54.847
-Wow.
-Good for you.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.982
...and $90,000 of tool kits.

26:56.982 --> 26:59.785
So you do have a tool kit.
We just don't see it.

26:59.785 --> 27:02.921
Our tool kits currently
are hand-selected items

27:02.921 --> 27:06.859
that we've been using
that we love and recommend.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.093
But we do have dreams

27:08.093 --> 27:10.863
of releasing
our own proprietary tools.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.965
Just in the last year,
how much did you make?

27:12.965 --> 27:16.034
Last year our gross sales
were $294,000.

27:16.034 --> 27:17.903
But that's for pumpkins,
not classes.

27:17.903 --> 27:20.706
No, our business, we do all
different types of things

27:20.706 --> 27:22.708
pumpkin-related,
including events,

27:22.708 --> 27:25.944
classes, demonstrations,
and custom carving orders.

27:25.944 --> 27:28.947
If I want to order
Mr. Wonderful pumpkin,

27:28.947 --> 27:30.716
do I send you a picture?
And he will.

27:30.716 --> 27:32.017
For sure he will.

27:32.017 --> 27:33.819
How do I get
my face in 3D?

27:33.819 --> 27:35.821
Are you using laser cutters?
How are you doing this?

27:35.821 --> 27:37.890
We do all the artwork
by hand.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.124
And that's real pumpkin?

27:39.124 --> 27:41.760
These are real pumpkins
carved by hand.

27:41.760 --> 27:42.995
We're lifelong artists.

27:42.995 --> 27:47.032
People hire us to do portraits
and logos and movie posters,

27:47.032 --> 27:48.867
all kinds
of amazing designs.

27:48.867 --> 27:50.769
So somebody watching
on television --

27:50.769 --> 27:54.039
can they go to a website
and upload a picture,

27:54.039 --> 27:56.842
and you'll send them a pumpkin?
Or does it have to be local?

27:56.842 --> 27:59.044
We do ship pumpkins
all over the country.

27:59.044 --> 28:02.614
The cost of shipping a live
pumpkin is a little prohibitive.

28:02.614 --> 28:03.882
Nothing would
make me happier

28:03.882 --> 28:06.084
than sending a picture
of Mr. Wonderful....

28:06.084 --> 28:09.021
Yeah!
...and you sending me
a carved 3D pumpkin

28:09.021 --> 28:12.824
of Mr. Wonderful so I can
smash it on Halloween night.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.927
Or it could have a spike
in its head, like, yeah.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.061
-Even better. See?
-Even better.

28:16.061 --> 28:18.096
I think we should offer
a Wonder special.

28:18.096 --> 28:20.933
And I'll get a 7% royalty.
What would that cost?

28:20.933 --> 28:23.735
So a portrait of Mr. Wonderful
would probably be

28:23.735 --> 28:26.738
somewhere in
the $600 to $800 range.

28:26.738 --> 28:27.739
Oh, so worth it.

28:27.739 --> 28:28.974
You have to do the work
yourself,

28:28.974 --> 28:31.009
or do you have a lot of carvers
working for you?

28:31.009 --> 28:33.812
We do.
We have a team of artists

28:33.812 --> 28:38.183
that we staff mostly for
the peak weeks of October.

28:38.183 --> 28:40.719
The rest of the time,
we're cranking out

28:40.719 --> 28:41.853
as much of it as we can.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.155
But you're all pumpkin
all the time now,

28:43.155 --> 28:44.890

like you're pulling out

each a year as pumpkin dudes.

28:49.161 --> 28:52.064
No, they're all pumpkin
all the time one month a year.

maybe I want to do a little

28:54.766 --> 28:56.768

Can I do that?

28:56.768 --> 28:58.103
When we first started
the business,

28:58.103 --> 29:01.206
our season was really the week
or two before Halloween.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.809
Now our season
is a quarter of the year.

29:03.809 --> 29:06.044
So in August and September,

29:06.044 --> 29:08.246
we're carving tons of things
that are gonna be used

29:08.246 --> 29:10.916
in product placements
and advertisements.
Ah.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.150
It's really
content creation.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.653

on a watermelon?

29:14.653 --> 29:15.220
-Absolutely.
-Absolutely.

you'd be selling images

in Madison in 2010.

35:22.687 --> 35:25.357

The next year was Saint Paul.

a vacation town.

a lot of them close down.

Wisconsin are our only states.

35:40.905 --> 35:42.273

when you say 92,000?

That is grossed.
You grossed $92,000.

in 2021,

$392,000.

it was $392,000.

Guys, I desperately wanted
to have

37:42.260 --> 37:43.695
a successful
production company.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.664
The first movie we ever did,
which was "Paranormal Activity,"

37:46.664 --> 37:49.601
and I thought
after we had that movie,

37:49.601 --> 37:53.705
I'm gonna do low-budget
horror movies and nothing else.

37:53.705 --> 37:57.275
And I was lucky I had that
success when I was 35 years old.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.277
If I was 20, I would have said,

37:59.277 --> 38:01.412
"I want to make the next
'Transformers.'

38:01.412 --> 38:02.480
I want to make a big,
expensive..."

38:02.480 --> 38:04.315

"I want to do nothing

38:04.315 --> 38:05.583
but low-budget horror movies."

38:05.583 --> 38:08.286
And that's how
I grew my business

38:08.286 --> 38:09.587
to what it is today.

38:09.587 --> 38:13.925

You guys are not spending
enough time on what you have.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.765
And if I give you
one piece of advice,

38:20.765 --> 38:22.934
is to try and focus
on the assets that you have

38:22.934 --> 38:26.504
and make them more profitable
before you take in outside money

38:26.504 --> 38:28.740
or before you spend more money,
in any case.

You really haven't
given us anything concrete

39:02.674 --> 39:05.443

like your core business

39:05.443 --> 39:08.346

consistent

39:08.346 --> 39:09.681

to something else.

I'm out, yeah.

to be more concrete,

all over the map.

appreciate in value.
