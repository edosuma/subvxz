WEBVTT

00:04.272 --> 00:06.307

00:06.340 --> 00:08.309
YEAH. IT'S GOTTA COME OFF
RIGHT WHEN THEY POUR IT.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.577
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:09.610 --> 00:11.545
"WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE
WITH THAT SUGAR?"

00:11.579 --> 00:12.846
YES!

00:14.782 --> 00:17.185
(exhales)
ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE,
SO WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND?

00:17.218 --> 00:18.519
BOYD LIKES
THE GRILLED CHEESE.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.988
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THEN
TWO GRILLED CHEESES, PLEASE.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.022
AND CATCH OF THE DAY?

00:22.056 --> 00:24.092
HEPATITIS C.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.226
LET'S SEE.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.494
HOW ABOUT DUCK L'ORANGE...

00:26.527 --> 00:27.728
UNH-UNH.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.397
IN THE SHAPE OF A HAMBURGER?
ALL RIGHT.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.433
YO, HASH SLINGER.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.368
I'LL TAKE A RATION
OF POWDERED EGGS.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.405
NO BETTER WAY TO GET USED TO
MILITARY FOOD THAN THIS DUMP.

00:37.438 --> 00:38.572
OH...

00:38.606 --> 00:40.408
HEY, EVE, WE GOT YOU
AN ICED TEA.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.576
(giggles, mischievous voice)
WANT SOME SUGAR?

00:42.610 --> 00:44.578
UH, NICE TRY, SMALL FRY.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.448
BUT WE WERE TRAINED
BY THE SAME PRANK MASTER.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.351
AH, THE YOUNG.
THEY HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN.

00:50.384 --> 00:54.088
YEAH. FAKE VOMIT,
THE WHOOPEE CUSHION.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.356
THE RUBBER SNAKE
IN THE TOILET.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.558
THE REAL SNAKE
IN THE TOILET.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.094
YOU ASKED ME TO SNAKE
THE TOILET.

01:00.128 --> 01:02.096
(mouths words)
UH, HEY, DAD,

01:02.130 --> 01:04.432
I NEED SOME HELP WITH
MY JUNIOR R.O.T.C. COMPETITION.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.467
CAN YOU ASK MR. LARABEE
TO HELP ME

01:06.500 --> 01:08.035
WITH
MY RIFLE-HANDLING SKILLS?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.070
CHUCK LARABEE.
I KNOW HE'S A MARINE,

01:10.104 --> 01:12.973
BUT I THINK I CAN OUTSHOOT MOST
OF THEM WITH MY EYES CLOSED.

01:13.006 --> 01:16.310
AND YOU WONDER WHY I DON'T GO
HUNTING WITH YOU ANYMORE.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.478
WELL, DAD,
IT'S NOT SHOOTING.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.946
WE HAVE TO SPIN
AND TWIRL A RIFLE AROUND,

01:18.979 --> 01:21.282
KIND OF LIKE SOME GIRLY
CHEERLEADER WITH A BATON.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.416
(chuckles)

01:22.450 --> 01:24.218
IF I CAN DESCRIBE IT
LIKE THAT TO CHUCK,

01:24.252 --> 01:26.320
SURE, I'LL ASK HIM.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.955
YEAH,
AND IF I MAKE SERGEANT,

01:27.988 --> 01:29.557
IT'LL LOOK REALLY GOOD
ON MY COLLEGE RESUME.
HMM.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.125
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT IS REALLY SMART, EVE.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.893
GOSH, I WISH MANDY
HAD THOUGHT AHEAD LIKE THAT.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.829
SHE WAS REJECTED AT PRACTICALLY
EVERY COLLEGE SHE APPLIED TO.
(Mike) I KNOW.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.331
SHE'S GONNA BE STUCK
GOING TO U.C. DENVER.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.899
WELL, THAT'S NOT A BAD DEAL.
HEY. WATCH IT.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.234
I'M TAKING CLASSES
AT U.C. DENVER.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.136
YEAH, SORRY, I KNOW.
YEAH, I KNOW,
I KNOW, I KNOW.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.337
THEY'RE NOT
VERY SELECTIVE, OKAY?

01:43.371 --> 01:44.838
YOU GOT A WARM BODY, YOU'RE IN.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.840
WHICH IS ALSO
MANDY'S POLICY.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.742
HEY! SHH!

01:48.776 --> 01:50.278
THE KID'S RIGHT HERE.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.281
A-AND SHE HAS THE SAME
74% ACCEPTANCE RATE.
(groans)

01:53.314 --> 01:55.449
OH!
AH! BAM! THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT!

01:55.483 --> 01:57.117
(Boyd laughing)
VERY FUNNY!

01:57.151 --> 01:58.352
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME
FRENCH FRIES WITH THAT SALT?

01:58.386 --> 02:00.154
OH, SHH! (laughs)

02:00.188 --> 02:02.523
YOU GUYS! AMAZING NEWS!

02:02.556 --> 02:05.359
I WAS JUST ACCEPTED
AT LAGUNA BEACH UNIVERSITY

02:05.393 --> 02:07.461
IN CALIFORNIA!
WHAT?

02:07.495 --> 02:09.363
(Mike) WHAT?
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

02:09.397 --> 02:10.531
IT'S A CALIFORNIA SCHOOL.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.366
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T GET
THEIR QUOTA OF CAPRICORNS.

02:14.034 --> 02:17.938
-- Captions by VITA --

02:17.971 --> 02:20.774
(knock on door)
(Ed) HEY, MIKE,
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.710
HOLD ON A SECOND, MAN.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.212
I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE FIGURES
FOR MANDY'S COLLEGE.
MM.

02:24.245 --> 02:27.114
IT'S, LIKE, ALMOST
30 GRAND A SEMESTER.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.616
HOW DO PEOPLE AFFORD THIS?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.384
THAT'S TWO SEMESTERS,
FOUR YEARS--

02:30.418 --> 02:32.320
THAT'S ALMOST A QUARTER MIL.
THAT'S A BIG NUT.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.288
YEAH. MY NUT, IN A VICE.

02:34.322 --> 02:37.225
PLUS I GOT KRIS
AT U.C. DENVER,

02:37.258 --> 02:38.826
EVE'S JUST
AROUND THE CORNER.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.862
THAT'S THREE BIG NUTS.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.398
WE USED TO HAVE A GUY
IN GYM CLASS LIKE THAT.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.634
(mutters)

02:46.667 --> 02:49.203
THEY GOT HIM
A SPECIAL CUP, YOU KNOW?

02:50.338 --> 02:53.841
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE MANDY
GOT INTO L.B.U.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.209
LAGUNA BEACH?
YEAH.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.310
WELL, I MAY HAVE PLAYED
A HAND IN THAT.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.546
DEAN OF ADMISSIONS
IS A PAL.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.847
WHY?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.315
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M A FRIENDLY GUY.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.050
PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO ME.

03:03.083 --> 03:06.086
NO. WHY DID YOU HELP MY DAUGHTER
GET INTO AN EXPENSIVE SCHOOL

03:06.119 --> 03:07.721
WITHOUT ASKING ME?

03:07.755 --> 03:09.423
'CAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS
DOING YOU A FAVOR.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.658
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT HER
GOING THERE,

03:10.691 --> 03:11.859
WHY DID YOU LET HER APPLY?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.160
BECAUSE I LOVE MY DAUGHTER.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.829
I WANT THE COLLEGE
TO CRUSH HER DREAMS, NOT ME.

03:15.863 --> 03:19.333
SHE'S A BETTER FIT
FOR U.C. DENVER.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.235
WHY'S THAT?
'CAUSE IT'LL SAVE ME
200 GRAND.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.336
(knock on door)

03:22.370 --> 03:25.005
HEY, MR. B.
MR. ALZATE.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.674
YEAH, KYLE.
HEY, KYLE, WHERE YOU BEEN?

03:26.707 --> 03:27.908
OH, I GOT YOUR NOTE

03:27.941 --> 03:29.710
TO RESTOCK
THE TROUT POND WITH CAT.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.349
HERE.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.418
"FISH."

03:39.253 --> 03:40.521
YEAH, THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
A LOT EASIER.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.256
YEAH.
(closes door)

03:42.290 --> 03:43.924
HEY, KYLE.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.226
SIT DOWN. I-I GOTTA TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND.
YEAH.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.895
LISTEN, I'M SURE MANDY TOLD YOU

03:47.928 --> 03:50.063
SHE GOT ACCEPTED
TO LAGUNA BEACH UNIVERSITY

03:50.097 --> 03:52.132
AND U.C. DENVER.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.268
YEAH. GOT ACCEPTED
TO TWO COLLEGES?
YEAH.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.470
MAN, SHE'S GONNA BE BUSY.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.543
SHE'S PROBABLY JUST
GONNA GO TO ONE OF 'EM--

04:02.576 --> 04:04.312
THE ONE IN CALIFORNIA.

04:04.345 --> 04:07.281
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
A LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP?

04:07.315 --> 04:10.217
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
DISTANCE PUTS A STRAIN

04:10.250 --> 04:12.453
ON EVERYTHING, SON.
MM-HMM.

04:12.486 --> 04:17.124
LIKE MY LAST MARRIAGE COULDN'T
SURVIVE A KING-SIZED BED.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.592
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME AND MANDY.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.328
I MEAN, WE KNOW THAT
COLORADO AND CALIFORNIA

04:20.361 --> 04:22.763
ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES
OF THE CONTINENT...

04:22.796 --> 04:25.499
BUT GEOGRAPHY MEANS
NOTHING TO US. (chuckles)

04:25.533 --> 04:27.501
(chuckles) CLEARLY.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.637
LISTEN, I'M JUST SURPRISED
YOU'RE NOT UPSET

04:29.670 --> 04:31.472
ABOUT HER BEING AROUND
ALL THOSE SMART,

04:31.505 --> 04:33.307
GOOD-LOOKING, RICH GUYS.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.743
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
THEY ALL SURF

04:35.776 --> 04:38.312
AND PLAY THAT
BEACH BLANKET BINGO THERE.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.913
AND ROAST THEIR WEENIES...
WEENIES.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.450
AND DRIVE THEIR WOODIES.
BIG WOODIES.

04:42.483 --> 04:45.285
I GUESS, BUT WHAT KIND
OF BOYFRIEND WOULD I BE

04:45.319 --> 04:46.620
IF I ASKED HER NOT TO GO?

04:46.654 --> 04:50.090
WELL...
THE KIND THAT STILL HAS
A GIRLFRIEND. (laughs)

04:50.123 --> 04:54.762
I JUST THINK SHE'S SO MUCH
BETTER HERE AT U.C. DENVER.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.597
YEAH, BUT THERE'D STILL BE
SMART GUYS THERE.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.299
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S INTERESTED IN THAT.
YEAH.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.335
YOU'RE RIGHT, MR. B.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.103
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO MANDY

05:03.136 --> 05:04.872
ABOUT THIS WHOLE
COLLEGE THING.
(Mike) GREAT IDEA.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.874
(sighs and laughs)
(door closes)

05:06.907 --> 05:09.610
YOU KNOW, IT JUST
OCCURRED TO ME...

05:09.643 --> 05:12.380
THREE NUTS WASN'T
IN MY GYM CLASS.

05:12.413 --> 05:16.550
I HAD HIM IN HISTORY.
(scoffs)

05:16.584 --> 05:19.353
I DON'T KNOW
WHY HE SHOWED ME.

05:27.895 --> 05:31.164
(indistinct conversations)

05:33.501 --> 05:35.302
WOW. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.304
OH... (giggles)
THANKS.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.907
UH, RYAN, THIS IS
A REALLY EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.310
(chuckles) I WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO DINE-AND-DASH IN THESE HEELS.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.679
TONIGHT, MONEY IS NO ISSUE.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.148
AND YOU CAN ORDER
ANY OF THE WINES.
WOW.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.517
A-AS LONG AS THEY'RE
ON THIS SIDE OF THE PAGE.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.318
UH-HUH.
AND FROM HERE UP.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.221
BUT NOT THAT ONE.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.323
IF ORDER THE CHEAPEST WINE,
CAN I GET THREE OF THEM?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.426
ABSOLUTELY. I JUST WON'T
ORDER AN ENTREE.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.260
(chuckles)

06:00.293 --> 06:02.095
UH, SHE'LL HAVE
THE HOUSE CAB. THANKS.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.431
(sighs)

06:03.464 --> 06:04.698
YOU OKAY?

06:04.732 --> 06:06.700
YEAH. YEAH. IT'S JUST...

06:06.734 --> 06:08.736
MANDY'S MOVING AWAY
TO CALIFORNIA,

06:08.769 --> 06:10.270
AND I'M STILL STUCK
WAKING UP

06:10.303 --> 06:12.339
IN MY CHILDHOOD BEDROOM
BEING MOCKED

06:12.372 --> 06:15.175
BY MY "MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED"
TROPHIES.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.010
IT'S JUST HARD
BEING THE OLDEST KID

06:17.044 --> 06:18.412
WHEN THE YOUNGEST
IS DAD'S FAVORITE

06:18.446 --> 06:20.113
AND THE MIDDLE CHILD
IS, YOU KNOW,

06:20.147 --> 06:22.416
THE BREAKOUT STAR
EVERYBODY SWOONS OVER.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.117
WELL...

06:24.151 --> 06:26.286
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES
THAT MIDDLE CHILD

06:26.319 --> 06:30.357
ENDS UP BEING THE FUNNY ONE
BECAUSE HE WANTS THE ATTENTION.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.626
JON! HI!

06:32.660 --> 06:34.562
(chuckles)

06:34.595 --> 06:36.630
KRIS, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.
YEAH, YOU, TOO.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.065
UH, RYAN, THIS IS JON BAKER.

06:38.098 --> 06:41.034
WE USED TO WAIT TABLES
TOGETHER AT THE DINER.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.437
YEAH, WE HATED
THAT PLACE.
MM.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.038
SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

06:45.072 --> 06:46.373
STILL HATING IT.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.908
OH.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.478
HEY, DID YOU EVER HEAR
ANYTHING FROM THAT DEADBEAT GUY

06:50.511 --> 06:52.480
WHO TOOK OFF ON YOU
AND YOUR KID?

06:52.513 --> 06:56.116
THAT'S RIGHT...

06:56.149 --> 06:57.785
UH, YOU NEVER ACTUALLY
MET RYAN.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.988
YEAH, WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.924
OH, RIGHT ON. THAT'S...

07:03.957 --> 07:06.126
WELL, THAT'S, UH,
THAT'S GREAT.
YEAH.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.295
SO, YOU'RE FINALLY
OUT OF YOUR DAD'S HOUSE.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.430
OH... SO ENOUGH ABOUT ME.
UH... (laughs)

07:10.464 --> 07:12.500
YOU SEEM TO BE
DOING GREAT.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.401
TENDING BAR
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

07:14.434 --> 07:15.736
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I MEAN,

07:15.769 --> 07:17.471
OWNER'S KIND OF FULL
OF HIMSELF.
MM.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.339
HE'S YOUNG, SUCCESSFUL...

07:19.372 --> 07:20.674
EASY ON THE EYES.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.743
I'M THE OWNER.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.077
(laughs)

07:24.111 --> 07:26.313
AND TONIGHT'S ON ME. ENJOY.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.482
HUH?

07:28.516 --> 07:30.450
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

07:30.484 --> 07:33.521
OH, YEAH. I'M GETTING
AT LEAST TWO ENTREES.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.490
NO, RYAN, EVERYONE IS
MOVING ON WITH THEIR LIVES

07:36.524 --> 07:38.125
EXCEPT FOR ME.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.693
YOU KNOW, I HAVE JUST GOT
TO MAKE THE LEAP

07:39.727 --> 07:41.361
AND GET MY OWN PLACE.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.864
OR...

07:43.897 --> 07:45.833
YOU COULD...

07:45.866 --> 07:47.501
MOVE IN WITH ME.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.503
WHOA.

07:49.537 --> 07:52.272
(chuckles) SO THIS IS WHY
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.475
TRIED TO DAZZLE ME
WITH THE HOUSE CAB.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.144
IT JUST MAKES SENSE.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.947
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD WORK LESS
AND TAKE MORE COLLEGE CLASSES.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.381
COME ON. LET ME DO THIS.

08:01.414 --> 08:05.152
WOW. UH... I'M GONNA HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT THIS.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.987
YOU MIGHT WANT TO ORDER ME
A GLASS OF WINE.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.889
YOU HAVE A GLASS OF WINE.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.358
CHECK BACK IN TEN SECONDS.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.260
(mouths words)

08:16.163 --> 08:17.364
TEN-HUT!

08:17.397 --> 08:19.733
PORT... ARMS!

08:21.268 --> 08:23.904
RIGHT SHOULDER... ARMS!

08:25.539 --> 08:27.708

08:31.378 --> 08:32.980
OKAY.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.482
THERE WAS ONLY ONE LITTLE THING
WRONG WITH THAT.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.917
REALLY? WHAT?

08:36.950 --> 08:39.519
EVERYTHING, MAGGOT!
WE'RE GONNA DO IT AGAIN!

08:39.553 --> 08:41.589
(panting) OH, NO.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.356
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

08:43.390 --> 08:45.693
I MEAN... (deep voice)
YES, SIR, MR. LARABEE, SIR!

08:45.726 --> 08:47.728
ARE YOU A SOLDIER
OR A LITTLE GIRL?!

08:47.761 --> 08:49.429
TRYING TO BE BOTH, SIR!

08:49.462 --> 08:51.364
WELL, YOU'RE DOING
A PISS-POOR JOB

08:51.398 --> 08:53.100
AT ONE OF THEM!

08:53.133 --> 08:54.534
(normal voice)
SERIOUSLY, EVE, LET ME KNOW

08:54.568 --> 08:56.503
IF I'M TAKING THIS TOO FAR.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.038
(normal voice) NO,
YOU'RE REALLY MOTIVATING ME.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.339
LEAN HARDER
ON THAT "MAGGOT" STUFF.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.174
OKAY, WELL,
WHATEVER YOU SAY. NOW...

09:01.208 --> 09:03.510
(Chuck) PRESENT ARMS!
OH. IS OUR NEIGHBOR
STILL OUT THERE

09:03.543 --> 09:04.678
YELLING AT OUR DAUGHTER?

09:04.712 --> 09:07.047
(laughs) YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
AND IF SHE GETS TIRED,

09:07.080 --> 09:09.116
WE CAN JUST SEND
ONE OF THE OTHER GIRLS OUT.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.018
(Mandy) AHEM!

09:11.051 --> 09:13.420
HELLO, PARENTS.
UM, KYLE AND I HAVE

09:13.453 --> 09:15.455
A VERY IMPORTANT
LIFE ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.724
IT'S ABOUT L.B.U.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.558
OH, WHAT ABOUT L.B.U.?
WELL, LET 'EM FINISH.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.728
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.562
OKAY, SO... KYLE AND I
BOTH FEEL LIKE

09:22.596 --> 09:25.132
LAGUNA IS A WONDERFUL
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME,

09:25.165 --> 09:28.101
BUT WE DON'T WANT IT
TO TEAR US ASUNDER.
(whispers indistinctly)

09:28.135 --> 09:31.705
NOTHING MORE PAINFUL
THAN A TORN ASUNDER.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.473
WELL, YOU KNOW, HONEY,
U.C. DENVER

09:33.506 --> 09:35.475
IS A BETTER FIT FOR YOU.
IT--IT REALLY IS.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.144
YEAH.
U.C. DENVER? NO, I'M--

09:37.177 --> 09:38.545
I'M STILL GOING TO LAGUNA.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.947
BUT I'M GOING WITH HER!

09:39.980 --> 09:42.783
WHOO!
(both laughing)

09:42.816 --> 09:44.251
WE GOT IT ALL
FIGURED OUT.
YEAH.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.819
SHE'LL GO TO CLASS,
I'LL GET A JOB,

09:45.853 --> 09:47.755
AND WE'LL LIVE SOMEPLACE.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.192
WELL, YOU LEFT NOTHING
TO CHANCE THERE, DID YOU, KYLE?

09:53.526 --> 09:55.128
WE NEED A LITTLE TIME ALONE.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.097
MM-HMM.
YEAH, LADIES,
CAN MIKE AND I HAVE THE ROOM?

09:57.130 --> 09:59.900
NO. ALONE WITHOUT YOU.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.735
RIGHT. WE CAN TALK
ANYTIME. OKAY.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.337
BYE, MANDY.
(Mandy) BYE.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.906
LISTEN,
ENOUGH FOOLING AROUND.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.676
YOUR MOM AND I DON'T THINK
L.B.U. IS A GOOD FIT FOR YOU.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.177
YEAH. HONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE COURSES THERE--

10:10.210 --> 10:11.511
THEY'RE MUCH HARDER
THAN WHAT YOU'RE USED TO.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.346
MM-HMM.
WELL, THAT'S SORT OF
THE BEAUTY OF COLLEGE.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.982
I MEAN, FOR THE FIRST
FEW YEARS, THEY'RE BASICALLY

10:15.015 --> 10:17.484
JUST GOING OVER WHAT YOU
LEARNED IN HIGH SCHOOL.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.453
BUT YOU DIDN'T LEARN
ANYTHING IN HIGH SCHOOL.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.692
SO... I WON'T BE BORED.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.426
SWEETHEART, WE'RE--
WE'RE JUST WORRIED

10:26.459 --> 10:29.429
YOU MIGHT HAVE TROUBLE
KEEPING UP.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.131
THE SCHOOL ISN'T WORRIED.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.066
I MEAN, THEY OBVIOUSLY THINK
THAT I'M SMART ENOUGH.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.671
(inhales sharply)
ED PULLED A FEW STRINGS
TO GET YOU IN THERE.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.710
SO... YOU'RE SAYING
I WASN'T ACCEPTED

10:42.743 --> 10:46.313
BECAUSE OF
MY DESERVED-OSITY?

10:47.848 --> 10:49.549
OH, I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.351
YOU GUYS THINK THAT I'M TOO
STUPID TO GO TO A GOOD COLLEGE.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.820
NO, NO, HONEY. HONEY--
OH, STOP.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.055
YEAH.
I WOULD NEVER, EVER
SAY YOU WERE STUPID.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.490
YOU'RE TOO LAZY.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.192
OKAY, SO JUST TO BE CLEAR,

10:59.226 --> 11:00.560
NEITHER OF YOU THINK
THAT I CAN CUT IT, RIGHT?

11:00.593 --> 11:01.695
NO. NO, NO. HONEY--
NO, THAT HAS NOTHING--

11:01.729 --> 11:03.296
WELL, THEN SCREW COLLEGE.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.531
WHO SAID I EVER WANTED
TO GO IN THE FIRST PLACE?

11:04.564 --> 11:06.399
NO, MANDY--MAN--
(sighs)

11:06.433 --> 11:08.568
REALLY? REALLY?
YOU CALL HER LAZY?

11:08.601 --> 11:09.903
YOU CALLED HER STUPID!

11:09.937 --> 11:11.905
I DID NOT CALL HER STUPID.
I-I...

11:11.939 --> 11:13.640
NO, I IMPLIED IT.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.543
I DIDN'T THINK
SHE'D FIGURE IT OUT.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.985
REST OF YOUR ORDER WILL BE
OUT IN A MINUTE,

11:25.018 --> 11:27.387
MALIBU BARBIE.
(chuckles) I WISH.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.389
ACTUALLY, I MEANT THAT
AS AN INSULT.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.224
YEAH, BUT WHERE'S THE INSULT?
I MEAN, SHE'S GOT

11:31.258 --> 11:32.993
A PINK CONVERTIBLE,
HER OWN DREAM HOUSE,

11:33.026 --> 11:35.528
AND A SISTER THAT'S
OPTIONAL AND LESS POPULAR.

11:35.562 --> 11:36.997
UP TOP. (laughs)

11:37.030 --> 11:39.399
(clattering)

11:39.432 --> 11:41.568
ANYWAYS, HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?
MOM AND DAD THINK

11:41.601 --> 11:43.570
I'M TOO STUPID AND LAZY
TO GO TO L.B.U.,

11:43.603 --> 11:46.373
SO... I'M NOT GONNA GO
TO COLLEGE AT ALL.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.409
OH. THAT'LL PROVE 'EM WRONG.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.012
SO YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA
GO TO U.C.D.?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.380
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
SERIOUSLY,

11:53.413 --> 11:55.215
YOU LOOK OUT THE WINDOW
AT L.B.U.,

11:55.248 --> 11:56.383
AND YOU SEE THE OCEAN.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.218
YOU LOOK OUT THE WINDOW
AT U.C. DENVER,

11:58.251 --> 12:00.387
AND YOU SEE DENVER.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.023
UNBELIEVABLE.
WHAT?

12:03.056 --> 12:04.792
WELL, MOM AND DAD WON'T PAY
TO SEND YOU TO SCHOOL

12:04.825 --> 12:07.194
AT THE BEACH, SO YOU'RE JUST
GONNA BAIL ON THE WHOLE IDEA?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.196
WELL--
THAT SCHOOL IS $60,000
A YEAR.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.765
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
THAT ADDS UP TO IN FOUR YEARS?

12:11.799 --> 12:13.566
OR MORE LIKELY FIVE.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.803
OR SIX.

12:15.836 --> 12:19.406
NOT IF YOU KEEP CHANGING
THE PROBLEM ON ME.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.475
OKAY, YOU SLACKED OFF
ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL, MANDY.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.045
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO
ACTUALLY DESERVE THEIR SUPPORT.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.413
WHO ARE YOU TO TALK?!

12:26.446 --> 12:28.415
YOU'RE STILL LIVING AT HOME
AND YOU'RE, LIKE, 100!

12:28.448 --> 12:30.984
ALL YOU DO IS COMPLAIN ABOUT
BEING STUCK IN YOUR LIFE.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.652
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING
TO CHANGE IT.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.487
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'M THINKING ABOUT MAKING

12:34.521 --> 12:36.289
SOME BIG CHANGES.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.791
WELL, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.726
I DON'T THINK ABOUT THINGS.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.962
(scoffs) YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:41.995 --> 12:43.563
YOU ARE RIGHT.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.466
(dishes clattering,
tray thuds)

12:46.499 --> 12:48.468
CARLOS, I QUIT.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.571
WHOA. HEY, KRISTIN,
COME ON. I'M SORRY.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.640
NO, DON'T--DON'T QUIT.
YOU CAN'T QUIT. NOT NOW.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.675
I HAVE A MILK SHAKE COMING.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.315
(Chuck) TEN-HUT!

13:02.349 --> 13:04.284
PORT... ARMS!

13:06.719 --> 13:09.189
(Chuck) RIGHT SHOULDER...
WOW. GOTTA SAY,
THAT WAS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.357
OH, YEAH.
HMM.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.325
THAT'LL SCARE THE HECK
OUT OF THE NORTH KOREANS.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.994
SEE ALL THOSE
SPINNIN' RIFLES?
HMM.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.864
THEY'LL FORGET ALL ABOUT
THEIR NUCLEAR AMBITIONS.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.798
(door opens and closes)
(Boyd) GRANDPA?

13:18.832 --> 13:20.800
HEY, BOYD, I FOUND
SOME STUFF IN THE GARAGE

13:20.834 --> 13:22.202
I WANT TO SHOW YOU, OKAY?
HEY.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.803
HEY, BUDDY, WILL YOU GO
UPSTAIRS FOR A SECOND?

13:23.837 --> 13:25.805
I NEED TO TALK
TO GRANDMA AND GRANDPA.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.340
(mischievous voice) DADDY,

13:27.374 --> 13:30.710
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
NEED TO USE THE TOILET?

13:32.545 --> 13:34.614
(clicks tongue)

13:34.647 --> 13:36.383
UH... (chuckles)
EVENTUALLY.

13:36.416 --> 13:40.854
WELL, BE UP IN, LIKE,
FIVE MINUTES.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.159
SOUNDS LIKE HE FOUND
THE RUBBER SNAKE.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.495
NOW HE'S NEVER GONNA
FALL FOR IT!

13:50.397 --> 13:51.698
LOOK, IT'S ABOUT KRISTIN.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.166
DO YOU GUYS KNOW SHE'S
TALKING ABOUT MOVING OUT?

13:53.200 --> 13:55.335
I WANT YOU GUYS TO CONVINCE HER
TO MOVE IN WITH ME.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.338
YOU'D HAVE BETTER LUCK
ASKING ME FOR MY KIDNEY.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.173
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.474
DO YOU THINK SHE'S
REALLY SERIOUS THIS TIME?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.310
I-I DON'T WANT KRISTIN
TO MOVE OUT.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.178
I-I'D REALLY MISS
HER AND BOYD.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.547
BOYD?
WHY DOES HE HAVE TO GO?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.582
WELL, HONEY, SHE'S NOT GONNA
FORGET TO PACK HIM.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.651
HE'S NOT A TOOTHBRUSH.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.386
WELL, MIKE, WHERE WOULD YOU
RATHER HAVE HER LIVE--

14:13.420 --> 14:15.022
WITH ME, OR IN FIVE POINTS?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.589
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE
SHE'S LOOKING AT APARTMENTS.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.226
FIVE POINTS?
YEAH. OFF MARTIN LUTHER KING
BOULEVARD.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.394
I-I GUESS THAT'S ALL SHE
CAN AFFORD ON HER SALARY,

14:21.428 --> 14:23.696
AND... I JUST REALLY
HATE THE IDEA

14:23.730 --> 14:26.399
OF HER AND BOYD LIVING
IN THAT PART OF TOWN.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.036
YEAH, THAT PART OF TOWN.
HEY, HOLD ON A SECOND.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.603
JUST HOLD THAT THOUGHT
FOR A SECOND.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.872
HEY, LARABEE, I WANT
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.
MIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:32.906 --> 14:35.175
DON'T DO IT--HONEY, NO!
YOU MIGHT GIVE US
A BETTER PERSPECTIVE ON THIS.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.776
WHAT'S UP?
RYAN IS WORRIED

14:36.809 --> 14:39.612
THAT KRISTIN MAY MOVE INTO
AN AREA CALLED FIVE POINTS.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.249
FIVE POINTS?
RIGHT.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.052
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH FIVE POINTS?

14:45.085 --> 14:46.586
(stammers)

14:46.619 --> 14:49.022
NOTHING. NOTHING.
I'M JUST NOT SURE

14:49.056 --> 14:51.224
IT'S THE SAFEST PLACE
FOR HER TO LIVE.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.593
WELL, I NEVER HAVE
A PROBLEM THERE.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.062
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M... SAYING.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.796
THERE ARE
A FEW ROUGH CHARACTERS.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.565
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT HE MEANS, MIKE.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.468
THERE ARE SOME
COLORFUL CHARACTERS.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.802
AHA.
YEAH.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.771
COME ON. VANESSA, PLEASE,
HELP ME OUT.

15:04.804 --> 15:08.141
I'M KINDA CURIOUS TO SEE
HOW YOU GET OUT OF THIS.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.810
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT
ON EVERY CORNER,

15:10.843 --> 15:13.746
THERE'S ONE OF THOSE
CHECK-CASHING ESTABLISHMENTS.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.449
PEOPLE NEED
THEIR CHECKS CASHED.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.884
AND LIQUOR STORES.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.419
PEOPLE NEED THEIR BOOZE.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.753
AND PAWNSHOPS.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.456
WELL, PEOPLE NEED
USED BANJOS.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.959
PEOPLE ARE VERY MUSICAL
IN FIVE POINTS.
OH, YEAH.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.727
(Mike) WAIT A MINUTE.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.462
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO

15:29.496 --> 15:32.065
WITH THE FACT
THAT FIVE POINTS IS A...

15:32.099 --> 15:35.468
"RACIALLY DIVERSE" NEIGHBORHOOD,
DOES IT?

15:35.502 --> 15:38.905
NO. NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.341
AHH.
AHH.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.577
(both laughing)

15:44.611 --> 15:45.512
YOU ARE SO BAD.
(laughing continues)

15:45.545 --> 15:48.781
(laughs)
I'M JUST MESSING
WITH YOU, SON.

15:48.815 --> 15:51.018
I'D BE SCARED TO DEATH
TO LIVE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.453
ALL THAT CHECK-CASHIN'.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.155
RIGHT. (laughs)

15:55.188 --> 15:57.857
(laughs) YEAH, OKAY,
THAT WAS HYSTERICAL, MIKE.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.295
BUT SERIOUSLY, WILL YOU GUYS
TELL HER TO MOVE IN WITH ME?

16:02.329 --> 16:04.597
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY KRISTIN
JUST CAN'T STAY HERE.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.433
DOESN'T IT MAKE MORE SENSE
FOR KRISTIN TO LIVE

16:06.466 --> 16:08.301
WITH THE FATHER OF HER CHILD?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.836
MAYBE WE SHOULD FIND
THIS KRISTIN

16:09.869 --> 16:12.372
AND SEE WHAT SHE THINKS.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.640
SO EVERYBODY'S DOWN HERE.
YOU HAVING FUN

16:13.673 --> 16:15.475
MAKING BIG DECISIONS
ABOUT MY LIFE?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.310
WHAT ARE YOU
SO DRESSED UP FOR?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.879
WORK.
THIS IS MY NEW UNIFORM.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.614
THEY CAN DRESS UP THAT DINER
ALL THEY WANT,

16:21.648 --> 16:24.017
BUT IT DOESN'T FOOL MY COLON.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.518
(laughs)
LOOK, KRIS,

16:25.552 --> 16:27.020
I AM PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.688
I AM NOT LETTING YOU MOVE BOYD
TO FIVE POINTS.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.958
WHY IS THAT, RYAN?
OH, JUST QUIT IT, MIKE!

16:31.991 --> 16:34.627
YOU'RE RIGHT. I-I WON'T BE
MOVING TO FIVE POINTS.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.229
(sighs) THANK GOD.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.531
AND I'M NOT MOVING
IN WITH YOU, RYAN.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.300
I-I'M SORRY. I JUST--
I CAN'T GO FROM LIVING

16:40.333 --> 16:43.236
UNDER ONE MAN'S ROOF TO LIVING
UNDER ANOTHER MAN'S ROOF.

16:43.270 --> 16:44.671
WELL, IT'S NOT ANOTHER
MAN'S ROOF.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.240
MY BUILDING IS OWNED
BY A LESBIAN COUPLE.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.875
(laughs) WELL,
I FOUND ACTUALLY

16:48.908 --> 16:50.743
A REALLY NICE 2-BEDROOM
IN LoDo.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.046
YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT
ON YOUR DINER SALARY.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.881
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S WHY I QUIT,

16:54.914 --> 16:56.316
AND I GOT A NEW JOB.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.251
REALLY? WELL,
THAT'S GREAT, HONEY.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.587
I--YOU'RE SO MUCH BETTER
THAN WAITRESSING.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.055
SO, WHAT'S THE NEW JOB?

17:02.089 --> 17:04.224
UH, WAITRESSING.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.193
BUT AT
A MUCH BETTER RESTAURANT.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.428
I'LL BE EARNING THREE TIMES
WHAT I WAS MAKING AT THE DINER,

17:08.461 --> 17:11.264
AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
MAKING ME A MANAGER.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.499
(doorbell rings)

17:12.532 --> 17:13.733
UH...

17:13.766 --> 17:15.068
HEY.
(Ryan) HEY.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.503
COME ON IN. EVERYBODY,
THIS IS MY NEW BOSS.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.071
THIS IS JON BAKER.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.739
HI.
OH, HI, I'M VANESSA. HI.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.241
(chuckles)
I'M MIKE BAXTER.

17:21.274 --> 17:24.077
HEY.
MAN, YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

17:28.215 --> 17:31.584
WELL, YOU KNOW, I USED TO
WORK WITH KRISTIN.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.420
HMM.
THAT'S NOT IT.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.623
WELL, UH, JON JUST CAME BY
TO GIVE ME A RIDE

17:36.656 --> 17:38.691
TO MY FIRST DINNER SHIFT.
YEAH.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.460
YOU KNOW, MAKES SENSE
TO CARPOOL,

17:40.493 --> 17:43.196
SAVE THE PLANET, RIGHT?
YEAH, WHATEVER.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.398
YEAH, I'M JUST KIDDING.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.634
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
ARE JOB KILLERS.
YEAH.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.669
I'M A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER.
I KNOW.

17:52.239 --> 17:55.475
WHOA. (laughs)
IS THAT YOUR CAR?

17:55.508 --> 17:57.910
UH... YEAH, YEAH.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.379
I HAD IT SOUPED UP A BIT.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.748
YOU KNOW, FOR MORE POWER.

18:01.781 --> 18:05.785
(growly voice)
OH, YEAH.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.587
BYE.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.259
NOW, THAT KID
WAS RAISED RIGHT.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.602
I KNOW HOW TO LIFT A BOX.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.471
I SAW THE WAY
YOU PICKED IT UP, MIKE.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.439
MAYBE YOU SHOULD START
LIFTING WITH YOUR LEGS.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.840
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP
LOOKING AT ME

18:27.874 --> 18:29.609
WHEN I'M BENT OVER, HUH?

18:29.642 --> 18:32.645
HEY, MIKE... WHOA!

18:32.679 --> 18:36.082
UM, CAN I TALK TO YOU GUYS
ABOUT L.B.U.?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.651
TALK IS CHEAP, UNLIKE L.B.U.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.487
HA HA. WELL...

18:40.520 --> 18:43.089
I STILL THINK IT'S
THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR ME,

18:43.122 --> 18:45.292
AND I'M GOING TO PROVE THAT
TO YOU BY GOING TO U.C. DENVER

18:45.325 --> 18:46.826
FOR A YEAR
AND GETTING MY GRADES UP.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.095
(clicks tongue)
THAT IS GREAT, SWEETHEART.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.097
WE ARE REALLY, REALLY
PROUD OF YOU.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.432
THANKS.
(speaks indistinctly)

18:52.465 --> 18:54.000
PLUS I FOUND OUT THAT
U.C. DENVER ACTUALLY HAS,

18:54.033 --> 18:55.502
LIKE, A REALLY GOOD
FASHION DEPARTMENT,

18:55.535 --> 18:57.804
SO I'M PROBABLY JUST GONNA
SWITCH MY MAJOR TO THAT

18:57.837 --> 18:59.672
AND THEN MINOR IN LATIN.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.274
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT LATIN?

19:01.308 --> 19:04.477
I LOVE SHAKIRA,
AND I'M REALLY GOOD AT ZUMBA.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.714
WELL, AS LONG AS YOU HAVE
THAT LATIN TO FALL BACK ON.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.520
THESE THE LAST OF THEM?
YEAH.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.390
(sighs)

19:19.492 --> 19:22.161
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN STILL CHANGE
YOUR MIND IF YOU WANT TO.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.663
I KNOW.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.365
AND, UH...

19:25.398 --> 19:27.667
I ACTUALLY HAVE.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.902
WAIT, NOW? AFTER WE
PACKED UP THE TRUCK?

19:29.936 --> 19:31.871
NO, NO, NO.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.574
I, UH, CHANGED MY MIND
ABOUT THIS.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.744
I'VE DECIDED
THAT YOU ARE WELCOME

19:37.777 --> 19:39.846
TO COME LIVE
WITH BOYD AND ME...

19:39.879 --> 19:42.315
IF YOU WOULD LIKE.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.883
I'M CONFUSED.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.152
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO BE OUT ON YOUR OWN.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.587
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

19:47.620 --> 19:49.155
BETWEEN MOVING
INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S PLACE

19:49.188 --> 19:51.524
AND SOMEONE MOVING
INTO MINE.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.564
GRANDPA, DON'T FORGET
MY BOOK OF PRANKS!

19:57.597 --> 19:59.198
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S LEAVE THAT BOOK HERE

19:59.232 --> 20:00.900
SO WHEN YOU COME BACK, WE HAVE
SOMETHING TO GOOF AROUND WITH.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.369
(giggles)
(Ryan grunts)

20:02.402 --> 20:03.503
IS THIS STILL GONNA BE
MY ROOM?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.405
YES, IT'S STILL
GONNA BE YOUR ROOM.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.873
YOU KNOW, YOUR GRANDMA WANTS
TO TURN THIS INTO A GYM,

20:06.906 --> 20:09.609
BUT I SAID NO, BECAUSE I LOVE
YOU A LOT MORE THAN SHE DOES.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.216
(sighs)

20:19.319 --> 20:22.121
HEY, BUDDY, ARE YOU OKAY
WITH THIS MOVE?

20:22.154 --> 20:24.391
I THINK SO.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.459
(exhales) IT'S OKAY
TO BE SAD, YOU KNOW.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.561
I KNOW.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.363
I AM REALLY SAD

20:30.397 --> 20:32.565
THAT I'M NOT GONNA GET
TO SEE YOU EVERY DAY.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.901
ME, TOO.
(groans) OH, KIDDO.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.403
BUT LISTEN, LISTEN.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.937
IT'S GONNA BE
EVEN MORE SPECIAL

20:37.970 --> 20:39.572
WHEN YOU DO GET TO SPEND
TIME TOGETHER,

20:39.606 --> 20:41.874
BECAUSE WE CAN JUST HAVE
PRANK DAY.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.476
WE CAN USE THE STUFF
IN THE BACK OF THIS BOOK.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.777
THIS IS AN OLD BOOK, YOU KNOW?
HERE'S ONE THAT'S--

20:44.811 --> 20:46.813
HERE'S AN OLD--
THIS IS AN OLD...

20:46.846 --> 20:48.415
DEMOCRATIC TRICK.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.950
A DOLLAR BILL
WITH A STRING ON IT.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.219
YEAH, JUST WHEN YOU THINK
IT'S YOURS...

20:53.252 --> 20:55.922
(makes whooshing sound)
RIGHT AWAY FROM YOU, I TELL YA.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.590
HERE'S A FUN ONE, THOUGH.
THIS IS AN OLD-SCHOOL--

20:57.624 --> 21:00.660
GRAB THAT PAIL.
(groans)

21:03.496 --> 21:05.498
GET A LITTLE BIT
OF WATER IN THE BUCKET.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.667
FISH WATER
IS PERFECT, TOO.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.701
(chuckles)

21:11.338 --> 21:13.473
STAND BACK.

21:13.506 --> 21:14.974
OKAY. HOLD IT.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.609
OKAY.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.778
I KNOW THE DRILL.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.113
(mischievous singsong voice)
OH, DADDY?

21:21.147 --> 21:23.082
CAN YOU COME UP HERE?

21:23.115 --> 21:25.452
(Ryan) BE UP
IN A MINUTE, SON.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.621
(pail clatters)

21:28.655 --> 21:30.657
BAM! NOW THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT!
(laughs)
