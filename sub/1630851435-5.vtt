WEBVTT

01:43.728 --> 01:45.355
It's the era of bare fists.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.399
THE ERA OF BARE FISTS

01:49.109 --> 01:50.193
Same goes for me.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.322
I didn't believe it until it happened.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.407
But in reality,

01:57.492 --> 02:00.662
a body that's been thoroughly strengthened

02:00.745 --> 02:02.038
is invincible.

02:02.872 --> 02:04.541
He can get through anywhere.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.419
No sensor would go off
just because you're a strong fighter.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.049
What Guevaru says is true.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.760
As long as you don't have a weapon,

02:15.844 --> 02:18.388
it's possible to infiltrate
various organizations.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.516
A man stronger than a machine gun exists.

02:22.142 --> 02:27.063
Thick-headed America,
must have finally realized that.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.817
They sent in three men
that needed surveillance.

02:32.068 --> 02:35.446
Your father, the "Ogre" Yujiro Hanma.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.450
"Unchained" Biscuit Oliva.

02:39.534 --> 02:43.204
And "Mr. Second" Jun Guevaru.

02:43.913 --> 02:48.710
Of all things, these three
are under satellite surveillance.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.546
Sat… huh?

02:51.629 --> 02:53.423
By artificial satellite.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.466
What?

02:56.926 --> 03:00.471
Artificial satellites
are normally used in the military.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.432
But of all things,

03:03.057 --> 03:05.977
they were watching
the movements of just three men.

03:08.062 --> 03:10.190
The satellite watching the three

03:10.273 --> 03:13.401
was a detailed image
only a few meters off the ground,

03:13.484 --> 03:15.737
continually capturing its targets.

03:16.905 --> 03:22.160
And if even one of the three targets
moved faster than four km per hour,

03:22.243 --> 03:23.786
what would happen?

03:25.330 --> 03:28.249
In that moment,
over a half dozen satellites

03:28.333 --> 03:31.377
are forced to take emergency action
to follow the targets.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.796
Because of that,

03:33.880 --> 03:37.258
car navigation systems all over the world
which use military sats,

03:38.092 --> 03:40.762
are said to shift by 70 meters.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.933
Like running and fighting,

03:45.016 --> 03:49.270
any movement over four km per hour
that excludes vehicle transport.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.397
In other words,

03:51.481 --> 03:54.025
when they move faster than walking speed,

03:54.859 --> 03:57.654
the car navigation shifts by 70 meters.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.031
I'm driving on the ocean.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.117
Wow, that's crazy.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.036
Right.

04:05.119 --> 04:08.915
The three of them are maddening
for those protected by weapons.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.460
It's refreshing.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.676
What are you discussing?

04:24.138 --> 04:25.181
It seems…

04:28.476 --> 04:30.687
you were having a nice long chat.

04:31.271 --> 04:35.275
This guy didn't eat his meal,
so I gave him a little warning.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.446
Conversation is prohibited.

04:41.614 --> 04:42.949
Have you forgotten?

04:45.118 --> 04:47.787
Crush it or shave it off?

04:49.414 --> 04:51.207
Or break it?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.584
Either way, it'll be harsh punishment.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.967
You'll be getting the harsh punishment.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.220
Hurting gramps

05:04.846 --> 05:07.724
won't make your hair grow.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.060
I'm grateful to you.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.980
I've continued this job

05:14.063 --> 05:17.984
because I wanted a situation like this
from the bottom of my heart.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.445
Don't get me wrong.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.155
You instigated it.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.991
I just accepted it.

05:25.074 --> 05:30.246
You goaded me in that
hopelessly disadvantaged state,

05:30.330 --> 05:32.749
saying you'll punish me harshly.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.753
To top it off,
you pointed out my physical flaw.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.255
What to do?

05:39.339 --> 05:43.634
What to do with this overwhelming hate?

05:52.602 --> 05:55.521
I don't mean to make you lose face,

05:55.605 --> 05:59.108
but something like this
isn't a disadvantage for me.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.028
Dislocating my joints is easy.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.489
See?

06:04.572 --> 06:07.033
Once I do this, no one can…

06:37.563 --> 06:39.232
Help me…

06:40.108 --> 06:41.859
Don't worry.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.070
I promise I'll save you.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.032
I have no more… strength…

06:49.033 --> 06:50.034
There's nothing.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.122
You'll get nothing from him in return.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.293
He's American, after all.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.318
How soft-hearted.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.788
I guess I made quite a mess.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.373
No…

07:37.915 --> 07:39.750
Nothing unusual happened today.

07:40.668 --> 07:45.047
The meal transport wagon fell over,

07:45.131 --> 07:47.091
but it was my personal mistake.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.761
That's my log today.

07:58.060 --> 08:00.688
After three days of prison life,

08:00.771 --> 08:02.982
Baki was returned to normal life.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.250
Under the blazing sun…

08:24.337 --> 08:26.756
He was busy laying ground for new roads.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.762
I see. No wonder the work goes so fast.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.848
It takes you only
two swings to hammer it in.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.769
No wonder there's
a difference with the others.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.781
This is a new record.

08:52.365 --> 08:56.077
Even Michael needs three swings.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.835
The two of you are close competition.

09:12.927 --> 09:13.803
Break time!

09:21.894 --> 09:24.188
I heard, Mr. Michael.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.983
You're getting out next month.

09:34.156 --> 09:37.577
Huh? You're going after what?

09:38.286 --> 09:41.581
The title for the all-around heavy weight.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.833
Oh, yeah?

09:43.916 --> 09:46.043
Three months after I get out.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.338
The first match is already set.

09:50.923 --> 09:54.343
Mr. Michael,
about what you said the other day.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.638
It has nothing to do with me.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.808
You're right.

10:00.891 --> 10:04.770
You don't have time
to be involved in a prison ranking.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.608
It's not that
I'm not interested in that title,

10:09.358 --> 10:13.195
but my team is waiting for me in Brooklyn.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.115
There's no need to hesitate.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.368
The world is waiting for you.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.624
Take a look at this.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.379
What's this check?

10:31.088 --> 10:33.716
A donation to our Arizona State Prison.

10:34.717 --> 10:39.055
From Bob Murphy, chairman of IBA,
the International Boxing Association.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.266
He handed it to me personally yesterday.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.769
He came here?

10:45.811 --> 10:47.647
They don't want it to happen.

10:48.439 --> 10:51.651
They don't want the belt
going to a criminal again.

10:53.569 --> 10:56.155
In the early sixties,

10:56.238 --> 11:00.910
the heavyweight record
was a miserable one it seems.

11:01.911 --> 11:02.745
Why?

11:03.788 --> 11:06.415
Because the man
who learned boxing in prison,

11:06.499 --> 11:10.920
Sonny Liston, was the reigning champ.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.548
Sonny Liston,

11:14.632 --> 11:17.843
who had several arrest records
since his younger years,

11:17.927 --> 11:20.554
learned to box in prison and then debuted.

11:20.638 --> 11:24.809
He finally climbed to become
the heavyweight world champion.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.896
But what awaited him
when he became champion,

11:29.397 --> 11:32.108
wasn't the sound of victory, but booing.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.697
The promoters too,

11:37.780 --> 11:41.409
until the later arrival
of the great Cassius Clay,

11:41.492 --> 11:43.494
had to endure the darkness.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.915
They don't want to replay that nightmare.

11:48.499 --> 11:51.961
So what do they want us to do?

11:52.044 --> 11:55.881
We just have to make it
so he can't box again.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.843
Do you mean the Iron Michael?

11:59.468 --> 12:01.095
Who would take on that role?

12:01.721 --> 12:04.515
He's a man who
used to be heavy weight champion.

12:05.099 --> 12:09.353
He has the fighting ability far beyond
that of the usual strong fighter.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.732
The two with any chance of winning,

12:12.815 --> 12:16.360
Oliva and Guevaru,
would never help us in a million years.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.113
Call Mouth.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.159
That's insane, Chief.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.161
Because those guys…

12:29.331 --> 12:33.419
Those three would understand how we feel.

12:33.502 --> 12:36.756
And they could definitely beat Michael.

12:37.339 --> 12:38.758
Not only that…

12:38.841 --> 12:41.010
I cannot be responsible.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.053
Not only that,

12:43.846 --> 12:47.099
they are on our side to begin with.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.495
Did you need something, Chief?

13:08.287 --> 13:10.790
Are you sure you wanted all three of us?

13:10.873 --> 13:13.042
If you called us knowingly,

13:13.125 --> 13:15.836
then either way, it's an emergency.

13:17.087 --> 13:22.301
We don't like the reaction that occurs
when the three of you are together.

13:22.384 --> 13:26.555
But now, we are in need of that reaction.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.934
Then it should be
done immediately tonight.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.479
You look well.

13:35.397 --> 13:36.816
Give me a break!

13:36.899 --> 13:39.985
When I hear that voice,
my head gets confused.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.740
Then shall we speak one at a time?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.284
It may confuse you even more.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.994
I am "O" and "So."

13:50.162 --> 13:51.622
I am "Gen" and "U."

13:52.665 --> 13:54.083
I'm "Ki" and "De."

13:54.667 --> 13:57.670
But this would take too long to decipher.

13:57.753 --> 13:58.587
So…

13:59.338 --> 14:00.840
You look well.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.385
Each person says a syllable in turn.

14:04.468 --> 14:08.973
The smooth teamwork
makes it seem like one person is speaking.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.101
It's true,
when you hear it for the first time,

14:12.184 --> 14:14.854
you may get confused
by the discrepancy in sound.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.356
You will soon get used to it.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.108
It is impressive.

14:19.775 --> 14:23.362
A great achievement made
by combining the similar.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.116
Fire, steam and cylinder,
of a steam engine.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.369
The horse, whip, and rider
of horseback riding.

14:30.452 --> 14:33.372
The sun, water and great trees of Earth.

14:34.456 --> 14:37.626
They are all great achievements,
great teamwork.

14:38.210 --> 14:42.381
But of all the various forms
of teamwork that exist in this world,

14:42.464 --> 14:45.426
the smoothest and greatest,

14:45.968 --> 14:48.345
the team among teams,

14:48.429 --> 14:50.389
the king of combo's…

14:51.515 --> 14:54.602
Is the lips, teeth and tongue.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.689
The combination of lips, teeth and tongue.

14:59.356 --> 15:04.111
For example, imagine eating a piece
of fish for better understanding.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.990
First, you try
to put the fish in the mouth.

15:08.699 --> 15:12.912
When the fish brushes your lips,
they will draw it in

15:13.495 --> 15:15.706
and close with perfect timing.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.335
Once the lips wrap around the food,
it can no longer escape.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.839
The sight of the fish
in the mouth is extremely tragic.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.801
It is severed and carried deeper
by the soft tongue,

15:27.885 --> 15:29.637
and crushed by the molars.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.556
The pieces of flesh that survive

15:32.640 --> 15:36.560
are mercilessly sought by the tongue,
and carried back to the molars,

15:37.144 --> 15:39.939
until all the flesh is in a creamed state.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.650
Furthermore, this tongue,

15:43.150 --> 15:46.445
amid the complex process,
will even detect small bones,

15:46.528 --> 15:48.155
and pass them to the lips.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.991
What's even more surprising,

15:51.075 --> 15:53.619
even while completing
these thrilling tasks,

15:53.702 --> 15:57.957
there's not one scratch
on the lips and tongue by the teeth.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.293
You can truly say
it's the perfect teamwork.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.713
I don't know who called them "Mouth."

16:04.797 --> 16:06.715
I don't know who called them,

16:07.383 --> 16:10.219
"Lip, Tooth, Tongue."

16:10.302 --> 16:13.472
That's what they're called.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.477
I want to ask you three a question.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.561
Go ahead.

16:20.562 --> 16:24.483
I think I understand
your unusual teamwork,

16:24.566 --> 16:29.989
but when it comes to fighting,
how is that combo used?

16:30.739 --> 16:32.574
Against that man of iron?

16:39.331 --> 16:40.749
Lip will answer.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.502
Many normal people tend to misunderstand.

16:43.585 --> 16:48.257
Your idea is
an exaggerated illusion of martial arts.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.802
You're saying
I'm overestimating the Iron Michael?

16:52.428 --> 16:54.263
He's currently paying for his crime,

16:55.014 --> 16:58.767
but he is a legendary
world heavyweight champ!

16:59.560 --> 17:02.730
Aren't you underestimating him?

17:03.230 --> 17:06.984
We had no intention
of explaining with words to begin with.

17:08.068 --> 17:12.072
We'll just use him
as our guinea pig to show you.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.829
Calling me out here isn't very peaceful.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.041
Tooth, what's the number?

17:22.791 --> 17:27.546
2.5, 3.0 to 3.2 at best.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.631
Sounds about right.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.551
3.2? Expected nothing less
of the Iron Michael.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.262
He has high athletic ability,

17:35.345 --> 17:37.431
but his muscled frame limits him.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.059
He won't reach 4.0.

17:40.642 --> 17:45.606
He has 3.2 times
the fighting ability of the normal male.

17:46.690 --> 17:47.816
Impossible.

17:47.900 --> 17:52.029
How can Iron Michael
be 3.2 times the normal person?

17:52.613 --> 17:54.823
You couldn't beat him with ten people.

17:55.491 --> 17:59.578
You seem to be versed in martial arts,
but amateurs from the looks of you.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.330
How rude.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.415
We are not amateurs.

18:03.499 --> 18:09.379
Each of us has some experience in karate,
boxing, and judo to be exact,

18:09.922 --> 18:13.342
though we don't have
a certificate or black belt.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.887
This is reckless
if you've only dabbled in martial arts.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.974
Your opponent is the strongest boxer
known as the Iron Man.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.104
It's because we have no need for that,

18:25.687 --> 18:28.565
even if the opponent is you,
a heavyweight champ.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.236
Tales of heroic exploits
exist in the streets.

18:32.319 --> 18:35.989
"He defeated three thugs
before we knew it."

18:36.657 --> 18:39.243
"He KO'd five goons one after the other."

18:39.326 --> 18:43.080
All of them are brilliant
and brave battle achievements.

18:44.081 --> 18:47.501
So how much stronger are these experts?

18:47.626 --> 18:50.254
Five times? Six times? Ten times?

18:51.004 --> 18:52.256
The answer is no.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.425
They're 1.5 to 2.0 times
the normal person.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.762
Even a world class champ,
is 2.5 times at best.

18:59.555 --> 19:05.269
But in reality, three amateurs are
of no match against a champion-level pro.

19:06.103 --> 19:09.982
The man may only be 2.5 times stronger
but the three can't beat him.

19:10.607 --> 19:11.441
Why?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.485
The answer is simple.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.156
Because they're not used
to fighting as three.

19:19.741 --> 19:20.576
Soccer,

19:20.659 --> 19:21.577
rugby,

19:21.660 --> 19:23.078
volleyball…

19:23.162 --> 19:25.581
They don't have that kind of teamwork.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.918
Nowadays, the only battles with teamwork

19:30.419 --> 19:31.837
ironically,

19:31.920 --> 19:35.799
exist only in something
that's hardly a sport, pro wrestling.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.848
A person's face is quite hard.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.457
He's running away…

20:09.082 --> 20:10.209
Without hesitation.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.548
This isn't…

20:17.299 --> 20:20.093
This isn't a battle!

20:21.637 --> 20:22.471
It is.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.734
Authority is falling apart.

20:36.902 --> 20:37.736
Is this okay?

20:38.820 --> 20:40.489
How can this be okay?

20:41.531 --> 20:45.369
I can't believe they kicked the great
champ Iron Michael's face with their feet!

20:46.119 --> 20:49.790
He's a legendary boxer
the whole world was crazy about.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.750
How can they kick his face?

20:52.334 --> 20:55.504
What gives the three of them the right?

21:11.937 --> 21:12.771
That's it!

21:12.854 --> 21:15.565
He succeeded in getting
the three out in front!

21:21.571 --> 21:22.781
Get them.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.284
Get them, Champ!

21:25.951 --> 21:27.953
I see, he's not stupid.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.455
In respect of the great champion,

21:31.331 --> 21:32.541
we too…

21:34.001 --> 21:36.128
will take you on with boxing.

23:15.769 --> 23:19.439
