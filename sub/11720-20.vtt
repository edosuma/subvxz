Yeah. I got your text.

00:50.726 --> 00:52.459
I'm on my way.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.694
Look, I'm sorry, boss.

00:54.696 --> 00:55.796
The Lees' pool
took longer than expected.

00:55.798 --> 00:57.564
They're out of town again.

00:57.566 --> 01:00.066
The filter's all gunked up.

01:02.470 --> 01:04.671
Well, this doesn't
sound like anything major.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.907
Just shorten the sensor.

01:06.909 --> 01:08.175
Yeah. I'll be there in 10.

ain't my thing.

02:59.922 --> 03:00.888
Spearfishing.

03:00.890 --> 03:04.191
I stand corrected.

03:06.462 --> 03:08.128
Huh, I guess
McGarrett was right.

03:09.965 --> 03:11.999
Right about what?

03:12.001 --> 03:13.200
Oh, nothing.

03:13.202 --> 03:14.301
He just said,
you'd never catch on

03:14.303 --> 03:15.236
quite as quick as he did.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.972
Oh, so McGarrett said that,

03:17.974 --> 03:19.073
did he?

03:19.075 --> 03:20.074
Oh, now, come on,

03:20.076 --> 03:22.343
don't let that
get under your skin.

03:22.345 --> 03:24.245
The guy's a Navy SEAL.
He grew up on the island.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.913
You're a city boy.

03:27.249 --> 03:28.782
He was a natural, though,

03:28.784 --> 03:30.351
I got to say.

03:30.353 --> 03:32.419
He took home half a dozen fish
on his very first time out.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.654
How many?

03:33.656 --> 03:34.788
Half a dozen.

03:36.058 --> 03:37.191
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:37.193 --> 03:38.692
Slow down.
Hold on, now.

03:38.694 --> 03:40.361
Remember,
that when you get

03:40.363 --> 03:42.263
over your target...

04:06.322 --> 04:07.521
Oh, ho...!

04:08.724 --> 04:10.524
"A city boy", my ass.
Take a look at that sucker.

04:10.526 --> 04:13.427
How many did McGarrett get
on his first try, you say?

04:13.429 --> 04:14.361
Half a dozen.

04:14.363 --> 04:15.562
Oh.

04:15.564 --> 04:16.730
But I'll tell you what...

04:16.732 --> 04:18.832
that's three times bigger
than anything he caught.

04:20.136 --> 04:21.435
You got your phone?

04:21.437 --> 04:22.670
Yeah...

04:22.672 --> 04:24.872
Take a picture
and send it to him.

04:24.874 --> 04:26.106
Oh, come on.
You sure you want to

04:26.108 --> 04:27.141
kick up that hornet's nest?

04:27.143 --> 04:28.742
Oh, hell yeah, I do!

04:28.744 --> 04:30.778
Come on,
just take a picture.

04:30.780 --> 04:31.979
All right. All right.

04:33.848 --> 04:35.783
All right. Ready? Smile.
Yeah.

04:46.595 --> 04:47.728
Victim's Nico Káne.

04:47.730 --> 04:48.929
He's a pool man.

04:48.931 --> 04:51.131
His boss sent him by to check
on a thermostat glitch,

04:51.133 --> 04:52.433
but he never
heard back from him,

04:52.435 --> 04:53.701
so he decided to
swing by himself.

04:53.703 --> 04:54.668
Who are the homeowners?

04:54.670 --> 04:56.437
Nathan and Olivia Cameron.

04:56.439 --> 04:58.238
An elderly couple,
semi-retired.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.506
They split time between

04:59.508 --> 05:00.507
here and Seattle.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.675
The house has been
empty for over a month.

05:01.677 --> 05:02.609
Max, what do we know?

05:03.879 --> 05:05.679
Two gunshot wounds
to the thorax.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.514
Based on the body temp
and degree of coagulation

05:07.516 --> 05:08.782
in the blood pool,

05:08.784 --> 05:12.152
I estimate the T.O.D.
to be roughly two hours ago.

05:12.154 --> 05:14.388
The trajectory of the rounds
and the position of the body

05:14.390 --> 05:16.256
suggest that the
victim was shot by

05:16.258 --> 05:17.324
somebody inside the house.

05:17.326 --> 05:19.059
He died when he fell

05:19.061 --> 05:20.995
and there was no effort
to move the body.

05:20.997 --> 05:21.996
There's no sign of forced entry.

05:21.998 --> 05:23.464
Door was open
and the key in the lock

05:23.466 --> 05:24.598
when his boss found him.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.433
There's plenty of valuables
for the taking,

05:26.435 --> 05:27.568
but nothing seems to be missing.

05:27.570 --> 05:28.836
Where'd Nico get the key?

05:28.838 --> 05:30.804
Flower pot. The owner
kept the key there,

05:30.806 --> 05:33.640
in case Nico needed to get the
control panel for the pool.

05:33.642 --> 05:35.409
He also trusted him
with the alarm code.

05:35.411 --> 05:37.745
How many other people
had access to this house?

05:37.747 --> 05:39.480
One. A friend of the family
checks in on this place

05:39.482 --> 05:41.215
a couple times a week,
when they're away.

05:41.217 --> 05:42.616
Okay, so maybe the friend, uh,

05:42.618 --> 05:43.717
mistakes Nico
for an intruder,

05:43.719 --> 05:45.352
shoots him,
then panics and runs off.

05:45.354 --> 05:46.920
Maybe. But, this friend
isn't really the shooter type.

05:46.922 --> 05:48.856
She's just a kid.

05:48.858 --> 05:51.291
Dawn Hatfield, she's a sophomore
at Waikiki Community College.

05:51.293 --> 05:53.360
She's never had
a run-in with the law.

05:53.362 --> 05:54.795
HPD's trying to
track her down now.

05:54.797 --> 05:56.296
All right, well, if she's
the only other person

05:56.298 --> 05:58.778
who had access to this house and
she didn't pull the trigger...

05:59.234 --> 06:00.534
...who did?

06:00.536 --> 06:02.703
I'm thinking whoever
did the interior decorating.

06:06.041 --> 06:07.908
This make sense
to any of you guys?

06:09.511 --> 06:12.713
I've seen similar measures
taken at other crime scenes

06:12.715 --> 06:15.649
to mask the odor of a
decomposing human body.

06:15.651 --> 06:17.851
Yeah, but in this case,
the body's out there.

06:17.853 --> 06:19.887
So, what the hell
was going on in here?

06:32.183 --> 06:34.003
Neighbor said she saw
a sanitation truck

06:34.054 --> 06:36.354
come by this morning,
to empty her bin.

06:36.356 --> 06:37.655
Nothing unusual about that.

06:37.807 --> 06:40.866
No, but when she went to
pull it back up, it felt heavy,

06:40.867 --> 06:42.166
so, she looked inside

06:42.168 --> 06:43.734
and found a
big bag of trash

06:43.736 --> 06:45.569
someone else
dumped in there.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.571
So she flagged me down,
thought it might have something

06:47.573 --> 06:50.541
to do with our
murder investigation.

06:52.177 --> 06:55.813
You... don't...
remember me...

06:55.815 --> 06:57.615
do you?

06:57.617 --> 06:58.682
No. I'm sorry, I don't.

06:58.684 --> 06:59.650
Pua...

06:59.652 --> 07:01.018
Kai.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.053
Pro Bowl weekend last year.

07:03.055 --> 07:05.489
I helped you
crack a monster case.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.525
Oh, yeah, right!
Now I remember!

07:08.561 --> 07:09.894
I figured you would.

07:09.896 --> 07:13.264
Uh, you may also remember,
we kind of had a moment.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.233
Yeah... we did, didn't we?

07:16.235 --> 07:18.269
Yeah, and look at you now.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.937
You followed through
and you became a cop.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.373
Graduated top third
of my class.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.541
Well, I'm not surprised.

07:23.543 --> 07:24.575
You seem like
a really sharp guy.

07:26.045 --> 07:28.779
Uh, mind if I
ask you something?

07:28.781 --> 07:30.247
Yeah. Sure.

07:30.249 --> 07:34.084
How do you feel about
workplace romances?

07:34.086 --> 07:36.987
You mean like, you and me?

07:36.989 --> 07:39.657
I-I was just wondering
if you'd ever consider

07:39.659 --> 07:40.925
dating a colleague.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.760
Uh...

07:42.762 --> 07:44.728
You like sushi.

07:44.730 --> 07:45.663
Yeah. I-I love sushi.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.498
Pua...

07:47.500 --> 07:49.433
I have a boyfriend.

07:49.435 --> 07:53.137
Scale of one to ten,
how serious is it?

07:53.139 --> 07:55.172
Ten.

07:57.208 --> 08:00.077
Look, you're
a really sweet guy.

08:00.079 --> 08:01.345
I'm very flattered.

08:01.347 --> 08:02.446
I really am.

08:03.716 --> 08:06.951
Well, in-in case things go
sideways with Mr. Ten,

08:06.953 --> 08:07.885
I-I'm around...

08:07.887 --> 08:10.220
but the offer's limited.

08:10.222 --> 08:12.222
Once I get my detective shield,

08:12.224 --> 08:14.224
I'm, I'm gonna be
a pretty hot catch.

08:14.226 --> 08:16.026
I think you already are.

08:17.629 --> 08:19.630
Now why don't you
show me what you found.

08:26.137 --> 08:28.138
Hey, boss, over here.

08:34.145 --> 08:36.480
Oh, man,
it stinks like paint thinner.

08:36.482 --> 08:37.881
Good nose.

08:37.883 --> 08:40.217
Acetone.

08:46.391 --> 08:47.858
Bi-layered liquid,

08:47.860 --> 08:48.792
acetone.

08:48.794 --> 08:50.094
Those air fresheners were there

08:50.096 --> 08:51.528
to mask the odor
of the chemicals.

08:51.530 --> 08:55.366
Looks like our vic walked in on
somebody cooking crystal meth.

09:25.263 --> 09:27.531
Excuse me.

09:27.533 --> 09:28.599
Dawn Hatfield?

09:28.601 --> 09:30.234
Yeah?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.935
How you doing?
I'm Steve McGarrett from Five-O.

09:31.937 --> 09:34.004
Is everything all right?
Yeah.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.706
I just want to ask you a couple
of questions. That okay?

09:35.708 --> 09:38.676
Yeah.

09:38.678 --> 09:40.177
I think I was there
three days ago.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.512
Yeah, Tuesday--
that was the last time

09:41.514 --> 09:42.646
I checked the house.

09:42.648 --> 09:44.181
You sure about that?

09:44.183 --> 09:45.249
Yeah. I'm positive.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.717
Stopped by before my classes.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.853
Okay, you're really
starting to freak me out.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.855
Was there like
a break-in or something?

09:56.061 --> 09:57.594
Oh, my God.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.897
That's Nico.
That's the Camerons' pool guy.

09:59.899 --> 10:02.599
What happened?

10:02.601 --> 10:05.035
Somebody shot him
from inside of the house.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.538
How well
did you know Nico?

10:07.540 --> 10:09.073
I mean, I didn't.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.374
Really, I mean we...

10:10.376 --> 10:13.777
bumped into each other
a few times at the house.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.179
Can you think of anybody else
that might have had access

10:15.181 --> 10:17.114
to the key or the alarm code
besides you and Nico?

10:17.116 --> 10:18.816
No.

10:18.818 --> 10:20.284
I don't think so.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.819
You never took anybody
to the house with you?

10:21.821 --> 10:23.187
No. The Camerons
specifically told me not to,

10:23.189 --> 10:24.755
so, I always went alone.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.256
Okay. All right.

10:26.258 --> 10:27.758
The last time
you were there was Tuesday?

10:27.760 --> 10:29.860
Yeah. I watered
the inside plants,

10:29.862 --> 10:31.195
checked the thermostat,

10:31.197 --> 10:32.696
made sure
everything was okay.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.965
Do you remember seeing
anything unusual in the kitchen?

10:34.967 --> 10:36.500
No. It was spotless.

10:36.502 --> 10:38.235
Like it always is.

10:39.938 --> 10:41.605
Why are you asking me
these questions?

10:41.607 --> 10:44.274
Because last Tuesday
the alarm was disarmed

10:44.276 --> 10:46.643
and it was never
turned back on again.

10:50.148 --> 10:52.015
Oh, my God.

10:55.086 --> 10:57.387
I... I didn't reset the alarm.

10:57.389 --> 11:00.324
That's how someone got
in the house, isn't it?

11:00.326 --> 11:03.527
So Nico's dead.

11:03.529 --> 11:05.529
This is all my fault.

11:13.772 --> 11:14.905
Hey.

11:14.907 --> 11:15.939
Hey.

11:15.941 --> 11:17.574
Physical therapy
appointment, huh?

11:17.576 --> 11:19.076
Yeah. Yeah.
My mandatory hour of joy

11:19.078 --> 11:21.078
with Nurse Ratchet,
thanks to you.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.980
Thanks to me?
Mm.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.182
What, you gonna blame that
building collapsing on us on me?

11:25.184 --> 11:26.150
I am. Yeah.

11:26.152 --> 11:28.252
And how exactly
am I responsible?

11:28.254 --> 11:29.586
Well, uh...
about four years ago,

11:29.588 --> 11:30.888
you came and knocked on my door

11:30.890 --> 11:32.756
and told me that I had
no choice but to work with you,

11:32.758 --> 11:33.857
so, I figure everything terrible

11:33.859 --> 11:35.759
that's happened to me since
is your fault.

11:35.761 --> 11:37.060
Hmm.

11:37.062 --> 11:38.662
You're like a cloud,
dark cloud,

11:38.664 --> 11:40.631
that never goes away.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.466
Do me a favor, when you see
Nurse Ratchet, have her, uh,

11:42.468 --> 11:44.735
check your head while
she works the rest of you over,

11:44.737 --> 11:46.103
'cause you got some damage
up there, too.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.471
Okay. You done?
Amber's waiting in the car.

11:47.473 --> 11:48.839
I got to go.
Amber's waiting in the car?

11:48.841 --> 11:49.706
Yeah. Amber's
waiting in the car.

11:49.708 --> 11:50.507
That's what I said.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.409
Huh.

11:52.411 --> 11:55.712
Things must've gone well
in Maui then.

11:55.714 --> 11:56.747
They did.
You look very surprised.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.882
Well, I mean...
a little surprised,

11:58.884 --> 12:01.118
given your propensity
to blow up relationships.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.152
My propensity to to blow up--

12:02.154 --> 12:03.153
that's funny coming from the guy

12:03.155 --> 12:04.021
whose girlfriend
is currently AWOL.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.422
AWOL?
Yeah.

12:05.424 --> 12:06.590
No. I know where she is.

12:06.592 --> 12:07.658
She's on the mainland
visiting friends.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.326
To get away from you.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.595
Go to PT.

12:11.597 --> 12:12.596
I will.
Enjoy.

12:12.598 --> 12:13.530
Thanks.
I hope it hurts.

12:13.532 --> 12:14.731
Uh-huh.
A lot.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.434
I love you.
Love you, too.

12:19.704 --> 12:21.371
Just checked in with CSU.

12:22.874 --> 12:25.008
So, the Cameron house
was apparently wiped clean

12:25.010 --> 12:26.109
of any usable prints.

12:26.111 --> 12:28.045
Fong's still processing
the trash we found

12:28.047 --> 12:29.646
in the neighbor's bin.

12:29.648 --> 12:31.014
Well, if the inside of
that house is any indication

12:31.016 --> 12:33.183
of how good our shooter is
at covering up his tracks,

12:33.185 --> 12:34.284
we're probably not going
to find anything.

12:34.286 --> 12:36.620
Our perp might not be
as smart as you think.

12:36.622 --> 12:38.455
Pulled some data off the
wireless modem in the house.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.358
Someone logged into the
WiFi network multiple times

12:41.360 --> 12:42.459
over the last three days,

12:42.461 --> 12:44.461
including right up until
the time of the murder.

12:44.463 --> 12:47.264
I was able to get the user
from pulling an IP address.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.900
Kid named Joseph Son.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.635
No priors.
Nothing in the system.

12:51.637 --> 12:53.770
He's a Chem major at
Pacific Isle University.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.273
Rents an apartment
two blocks from campus.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.908
A Chem major who's obviously
way too smart

12:57.910 --> 13:00.644
to cook meth in his own kitchen.

13:02.447 --> 13:05.449
Building's
surrounded, Joseph.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.650
Nowhere to run.

13:11.923 --> 13:13.056
Steve, he's headed for the roof.

13:13.058 --> 13:14.458
I got him.

13:37.515 --> 13:38.715
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

13:39.784 --> 13:40.918
Don't be stupid.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.754
Joseph...
it's all over.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.722
Get on your knees,
put your hands behind your head,

13:45.724 --> 13:47.090
interlock your fingers.

13:47.092 --> 13:48.692
No, no, don't do it,
don't do it,

13:48.694 --> 13:49.693
don't do it!

13:49.695 --> 13:50.827
Joseph. No! No!

14:07.571 --> 14:09.972
So, this kid was more afraid
of going to prison

14:09.974 --> 14:11.106
than he was of dying.

14:11.108 --> 14:12.308
I don't think so.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.243
It wouldn't be the first time
we've seen someone

14:14.245 --> 14:15.911
try to take
the easy way out.

14:15.913 --> 14:17.012
I'm telling you, Chin.

14:17.014 --> 14:18.280
I mean, you didn't see
the look in his eyes

14:18.282 --> 14:19.181
before he jumped off
that roof.

14:19.183 --> 14:20.716
There was no fear there.

14:20.718 --> 14:22.651
It was anger, hatred.

14:23.854 --> 14:25.020
Fong.

14:25.022 --> 14:27.523
Duke, CSU find anything
in Son's apartment?

14:27.525 --> 14:29.625
Just a laptop.
The place was clean.

14:29.627 --> 14:31.961
No evidence that he was
using or selling drugs or

14:31.963 --> 14:33.295
engaging in any kind of
criminal activity.

14:33.297 --> 14:34.897
And the neighbors said
he was a great student.

14:34.899 --> 14:37.733
Not too many friends,
pretty much kept to himself.

14:37.735 --> 14:39.235
And nothing in our cameras

14:39.237 --> 14:40.736
that connected him with our vic
or the Cameron family.

14:40.738 --> 14:42.504
Well, he chose that house
for a reason.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.540
We need to find out
what that was.

14:44.542 --> 14:46.809
Hey, remember those water
bottles we found in the trash?

14:46.811 --> 14:49.111
Yeah. According to Fong,
there was residue

14:49.113 --> 14:51.513
of hydrochloric acid,
sulfuric acid

14:51.515 --> 14:53.349
and hydrogen peroxide
inside of them.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.883
Hydrogen peroxide's
not used in cooking meth.

14:54.885 --> 14:57.853
That's because Son wasn't
cooking meth in that kitchen.

14:59.456 --> 15:01.657
He was making a bomb.

15:14.137 --> 15:15.638
Well, ain't that cute?

15:15.640 --> 15:17.172
You waiting
for an autographed picture

15:17.174 --> 15:19.108
of me and that fish
I caught this morning?

15:19.110 --> 15:20.442
No, I'm not, but not bad

15:20.444 --> 15:21.744
for a guy in shallow water

15:21.746 --> 15:23.345
with a snorkel
and a spear gun.

15:23.347 --> 15:24.713
"Not bad"?

15:24.715 --> 15:26.882
Yeah, you see, real
fishermen, what they do

15:26.884 --> 15:28.951
is they dive out past
the jetty, first of all.

15:28.953 --> 15:31.320
We free-dive in at least
30 feet of water.

15:31.322 --> 15:32.688
We don't use a snorkel.

15:32.690 --> 15:34.556
We certainly don't use
a fancy spear gun.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.958
We use a, uh, hand spear.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.026
Do you know what
a hand spear is?

15:37.028 --> 15:38.661
You ever see one of
those before? Yeah.

15:38.663 --> 15:41.030
Well, excuse me,
Jacques Cousteau.

15:41.032 --> 15:43.866
You know, jealousy is
an ugly cloak, my friend.

15:43.868 --> 15:46.135
You do not wear it well.

15:46.137 --> 15:47.369
"Jealousy"?

15:47.371 --> 15:48.470
No, no, no.

15:48.472 --> 15:52.474
Look, that fish was
probably old, depressed,

15:52.476 --> 15:54.143
you know,
maybe a little, uh,

15:54.145 --> 15:55.911
senile, you know,
swimming around...

15:55.913 --> 15:58.981
looking for a tiger shark
to end his days,

15:58.983 --> 16:00.182
and then bumped into you.

16:00.184 --> 16:02.751
A senile, depressed fish?

16:02.753 --> 16:03.952
That's right.

16:03.954 --> 16:06.055
You are some piece of work,
McGarrett, you know that?

16:06.057 --> 16:07.156
All right.

16:07.158 --> 16:09.325
To what do I owe the displeasure
of this visit?

16:09.327 --> 16:12.027
I need your help
on something, Lou.

16:12.029 --> 16:14.163
All right, you got it.
What is it?

16:14.165 --> 16:15.331
That jumper out by university,

16:15.333 --> 16:16.932
a kid named Joseph Son.
Yeah.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.867
He's the suspect in the murder

16:18.869 --> 16:21.470
of the pool guy up in Lanikai.

16:21.472 --> 16:25.207
At the crime scene, we found
acetone, hydrogen peroxide,

16:25.209 --> 16:28.277
hydrochloric
and sulfuric acid.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.945
TATP.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.580
I'm thinking he was
building a bomb.

16:31.582 --> 16:33.115
But for what?
I don't know.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.149
That's why I'm here.

16:34.151 --> 16:35.751
We checked his apartment,
we checked his car.

16:35.753 --> 16:37.052
They're both clean.
No explosives.

16:37.054 --> 16:39.088
No, no contraband.

16:39.090 --> 16:40.656
So you think there's
other players involved.

16:40.658 --> 16:42.391
Yeah, and I think there's
an explosive device

16:42.393 --> 16:43.559
out there somewhere.

16:45.161 --> 16:48.197
Listen, I got a, I got that
sick feeling on this one, Lou.

16:48.199 --> 16:51.467
I can't stop thinking this is
a part of something much bigger.

16:52.802 --> 16:55.704
I need everybody you got
on this.

16:58.074 --> 16:59.908
Hey.

16:59.910 --> 17:01.009
Hey.

17:01.011 --> 17:02.177
Is that Son's laptop?

17:02.179 --> 17:04.546
Yeah. I just got into
some encrypted files.

17:04.548 --> 17:06.415
It looks like Son's been
chatting over the Internet

17:06.416 --> 17:09.617
with a top-tier Al-Qaeda figure
in Yemen, for over a year.

17:09.619 --> 17:10.618
Here...

17:10.621 --> 17:12.154
have a look.

17:15.657 --> 17:18.426
You know him?

17:18.429 --> 17:19.728
Yeah.

17:19.730 --> 17:21.029
That's Muhammad Nazaria.

17:21.031 --> 17:21.964
He's a poster boy

17:21.965 --> 17:23.499
for the American
Jihadi movement.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.101
And he grew up in a suburb
in Cleveland, Ohio.

17:26.103 --> 17:27.336
Ivy-League-educated.

17:27.338 --> 17:28.804
Last I heard he was hiding

17:28.806 --> 17:31.073
in some lawless region
of Yemen.

17:31.075 --> 17:32.641
Well, he may be in hiding,
but he continues

17:32.643 --> 17:34.276
to get his message out.
The thing that worries me

17:34.278 --> 17:35.978
is that chats
between Nazaria and Son

17:35.980 --> 17:38.113
stopped a few months ago,
after this last exchange.

17:39.048 --> 17:42.451
"Joseph, you must remain strong.

17:42.453 --> 17:44.119
"The very definition of jihad
is to fight against

17:44.121 --> 17:46.021
"and destroy the infidels.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.723
"Once you've chosen this
path of righteousness,

17:47.725 --> 17:49.391
you can never abandon it."

17:49.393 --> 17:51.193
And then Son responds:
"You have shown me

17:51.195 --> 17:52.528
"I have the heart of a lion.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.630
"I'm prepared to sacrifice
my life on this earth

17:54.632 --> 17:57.166
"for the good of our noble
jihad until our way is

17:57.168 --> 17:59.334
is the way of life
for all people."

17:59.336 --> 18:00.335
It's pretty clear

18:00.337 --> 18:01.970
from reading the exchanges
over the last year

18:01.972 --> 18:04.206
that Nazaria has slowly
indoctrinated Son

18:04.208 --> 18:05.674
into his own radical way
of thinking.

18:05.676 --> 18:07.309
Well, American kids
like Joseph Son,

18:07.311 --> 18:09.077
becoming radicalized terrorists

18:09.079 --> 18:11.013
is-is one of the intel
community's biggest fears.

18:11.015 --> 18:14.516
So, Customs has
Son taking two trips

18:14.518 --> 18:15.984
to Yemen over the
past 18 months.

18:15.986 --> 18:17.653
He was traveling
on a student visa

18:17.655 --> 18:18.620
issued through the university.

18:18.622 --> 18:20.622
Now, I had TSA pull
the manifests

18:20.624 --> 18:21.623
from all of his flights,

18:21.625 --> 18:23.225
to see if he was
traveling with someone.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.393
Sure enough, he was.

18:24.395 --> 18:25.427
This kid--

18:25.429 --> 18:27.229
Brian Miller, he was with Son

18:27.231 --> 18:30.466
on every single one of his
flights to and from Yemen.

18:30.468 --> 18:33.335
Same as Son.
No criminal history.

18:33.337 --> 18:34.770
And no known ties to any
terrorist organizations

18:34.772 --> 18:38.140
that would put him on the
radar with DHS or the FBI.

18:39.008 --> 18:41.410
All right, look,
TATP is cheap,

18:41.412 --> 18:43.111
it's easy to make,

18:43.113 --> 18:44.947
there's how-to videos
all over the Internet.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.915
It's possible these kids
are lone wolves,

18:46.917 --> 18:48.383
inspired by Nazaria,

18:48.385 --> 18:50.586
and planning some kind
of attack of their own.

19:11.307 --> 19:12.708
Get down!

19:17.714 --> 19:19.548
I'm good!
I got you guys covered.

19:19.550 --> 19:21.583
Lou, you okay? Lou?

19:21.585 --> 19:22.684
Perimeter is secure.

19:22.686 --> 19:25.187
10-4.
We have a least 2 bogies--

19:25.189 --> 19:26.955
one on the ground floor,
one on the second floor.

19:26.957 --> 19:27.990
Look at that.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.424
Lucky twice in one day.

19:29.426 --> 19:30.859
Copy two bogies.

19:30.861 --> 19:33.629
You know, only you
can see getting shot

19:33.631 --> 19:35.531
as being lucky.

19:35.533 --> 19:37.866
You stay down until I can
get you out of here.

19:37.868 --> 19:39.401
That ain't happening.

19:42.705 --> 19:45.707
It's over, Miller!
There's no way out!

19:51.614 --> 19:54.216
Moving in! Cover me!

20:08.565 --> 20:11.466
Throw down your weapon,
come out with your hands up!

20:34.390 --> 20:35.958
He's done.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.964
Got movement!

20:41.966 --> 20:45.567
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

20:52.442 --> 20:54.610
Give me your hands.

21:01.884 --> 21:03.919
Oh, so you surf,

21:03.921 --> 21:06.822
you kill people
and you make bombs, huh?

21:07.924 --> 21:10.392
You're a real Renaissance woman.

21:18.575 --> 21:20.309
I don't think
you get it, Dawn.

21:20.311 --> 21:22.111
This is the major
leagues, right?

21:22.113 --> 21:24.313
This is your life,
right here in this room.

21:24.315 --> 21:25.848
Right now. This is it.

21:27.384 --> 21:31.187
Okay, anything,
anything else happens

21:31.189 --> 21:33.089
as a result
of those explosives,

21:33.091 --> 21:35.558
anybody else gets hurt,

21:35.560 --> 21:37.059
anybody else dies,

21:37.061 --> 21:40.663
you're gonna pay for this
for the rest of your life.

21:40.665 --> 21:43.466
You understand what
I'm saying to you?

21:43.468 --> 21:44.867
Do you want to end this?

21:45.402 --> 21:46.768
You can end this, right now.

21:46.770 --> 21:48.571
You tell me where those
explosive devices are,

21:48.572 --> 21:51.807
we end this right here,
right now.

21:51.809 --> 21:53.842
You think you scare me?

21:53.844 --> 21:55.444
You think I'm afraid?

21:55.446 --> 21:58.413
Go ahead and beat me.

21:58.415 --> 22:00.849
Torture me.

22:00.851 --> 22:02.317
Do whatever you like.

22:02.319 --> 22:04.519
Because you'll never get
in my head.

22:04.521 --> 22:06.588
Steve...

22:06.590 --> 22:08.390
we got something.

22:12.662 --> 22:15.297
Get her over
to the Palace.

22:15.299 --> 22:16.765
We're not done.

22:25.241 --> 22:26.975
Look what we found.

22:35.251 --> 22:39.087
This is no small-time,
lone wolf operation.

22:39.089 --> 22:41.256
No.

22:41.258 --> 22:44.025
They were gearing up for a war.

22:44.027 --> 22:47.662
All right, so we know that Son,
Miller and Dawn Hatfield

22:47.664 --> 22:49.931
were planning an attack
on Hickam Air Force Base.

22:49.933 --> 22:51.800
It's what we don't know
that worries me.

22:51.802 --> 22:53.635
Russian-style

22:53.637 --> 22:55.237
military weapons,
100 G's in cash?

22:55.239 --> 22:57.939
Somebody had to be backing these kids.
FBI's running the three of them,

22:57.941 --> 22:59.608
looking for any connections

22:59.610 --> 23:01.710
they may have
to players here or overseas.

23:01.712 --> 23:03.812
And HPD and DHS
are stepping up security

23:03.814 --> 23:05.046
all across the islands,

23:05.048 --> 23:06.314
especially at military and
government installations.

23:06.316 --> 23:09.151
Do-it-yourself bomb-making
instructions.

23:09.153 --> 23:10.418
Nice touch.

23:10.420 --> 23:13.221
The lab is running handwriting
comparisons to the samples

23:13.223 --> 23:16.057
that we recovered from Son,
Miller and the girl-- no match.

23:16.059 --> 23:18.426
I think we have to assume
the worst and operate

23:18.428 --> 23:19.561
as if whoever drew up
these instructions

23:19.563 --> 23:20.896
are still right here
on the ground on Oahu.

23:20.898 --> 23:22.664
Yeah, and that there might be
other cells out there

23:22.666 --> 23:24.866
waiting to strike.

23:25.968 --> 23:29.037
All right, lookit, the military
sends all IEDs used

23:29.039 --> 23:30.372
in attacks
against coalition forces

23:30.374 --> 23:33.375
to an FBI warehouse near Quantico.
They also keep

23:33.377 --> 23:35.477
a library of documents recovered
from raids

23:35.479 --> 23:37.179
on Al-Qaeda
and Taliban safe houses.

23:37.181 --> 23:39.681
Okay, I'll get everything
we have and send it

23:39.683 --> 23:41.082
over to them.
Let's see if we can match

23:41.084 --> 23:43.084
the designs of these devices
or the handwriting

23:43.086 --> 23:45.053
in these documents to anyone
they may have

23:45.055 --> 23:47.689
in their database-- see if we
can find these kids' partner.

24:04.207 --> 24:07.676
The Symbionese
Liberation Army...

24:07.678 --> 24:10.579
the BLA...
the United Freedom Front--

24:10.581 --> 24:13.882
you know what all these groups
have in common, Dawn?

24:13.884 --> 24:16.318
They all attacked their
own country and they all lost.

24:18.387 --> 24:20.422
Their soldiers
were either killed

24:20.424 --> 24:22.090
or sent to prison.

24:22.092 --> 24:24.125
You understand what
I'm trying to tell you?

24:24.127 --> 24:26.194
This little jihad
or whatever it was

24:26.196 --> 24:28.363
you had going-- it's over,
it's finished, okay?

24:28.365 --> 24:29.731
It's history.

24:29.733 --> 24:32.434
The only thing left for you
right now is to save yourself.

24:32.436 --> 24:33.835
Now, I know
you weren't acting alone.

24:33.837 --> 24:36.371
I know that you had help.

24:36.373 --> 24:38.840
I want names.

24:46.249 --> 24:48.850
While you're thinking
about that, why don't you

24:48.852 --> 24:51.086
do me a favor and help me
understand something?

24:51.088 --> 24:53.788
Help me understand how
somebody like you,

24:53.790 --> 24:57.659
a smart, standout high school
athlete from Seattle,

24:57.661 --> 24:59.361
born in the greatest
nation on Earth,

24:59.363 --> 25:00.695
turns against her own people?

25:02.865 --> 25:05.834
You... are not my people.

25:05.836 --> 25:08.303
Who are your people?

25:08.305 --> 25:11.640
"Allah has cursed
the unbelievers

25:11.642 --> 25:14.609
and proposed for them
a blazing hell!"

25:27.857 --> 25:29.524
You should have it now.

25:29.526 --> 25:31.459
Got it.

25:31.461 --> 25:34.329
Good news is these instructions
are fairly detailed.

25:34.331 --> 25:36.731
And the Arabic dialect used
in some of the writing

25:36.733 --> 25:38.700
is unique to the Hazara region
of Afghanistan.

25:38.702 --> 25:40.368
Okay, that should
narrow it down a bit.

25:40.370 --> 25:41.870
I can get even more specific.

25:41.872 --> 25:43.938
This is definitely designed
to be a roadside bomb.

25:43.940 --> 25:46.474
TATP used
to initiate the charge,

25:46.476 --> 25:47.842
C-4 used as the explosive,

25:47.844 --> 25:51.513
and the combination of nails,
ball bearings and gravel

25:51.515 --> 25:53.014
projectiles make it very unique.

25:53.016 --> 25:54.416
Okay, so you've
seen this before.

25:54.418 --> 25:57.352
IEDs like this have been used
in the area around Kandahar

25:57.354 --> 25:58.687
over last couple of years.

25:58.689 --> 26:00.422
That's where I'll start looking
in the database.

26:00.424 --> 26:02.357
Okay, thanks.
I'll be in touch.

26:16.539 --> 26:18.340
There was enough hardware
in that house

26:18.342 --> 26:22.110
to make three bombs, Dawn.

26:22.112 --> 26:24.846
Why don't you
tell me your plan?

26:24.848 --> 26:26.581
Maybe detonate an IED
on the road

26:26.583 --> 26:28.016
leading into
the Air Force base?

26:28.018 --> 26:29.217
Wipe out some innocent
soldiers,

26:29.219 --> 26:31.052
then what, a couple
of secondary devices

26:31.054 --> 26:32.587
to shred up
the first responders?

26:32.589 --> 26:33.788
That sound about right?

26:33.790 --> 26:35.590
"Innocent" soldiers?

26:37.393 --> 26:41.863
They drop bombs thousands
of feet in the air,

26:41.865 --> 26:43.965
killing innocent women
and children like cowards!

26:43.967 --> 26:45.567
Cowards?

26:46.702 --> 26:47.802
You want to talk about cowards?

26:47.804 --> 26:49.537
You should have said so.

26:49.539 --> 26:50.939
Okay, let's talk about cowards.

26:50.941 --> 26:52.774
Why don't we start
with your boy Nazaria,

26:52.776 --> 26:54.542
your mentor?
Let's start with him.

26:54.544 --> 26:55.977
Where is he?
He's hiding...

26:55.979 --> 26:58.513
in a cave in the mountains
of Yemen.

26:58.515 --> 27:00.382
You think that traitor
cares about you?

27:00.384 --> 27:02.617
You think that piece of
garbage gives a damn

27:02.619 --> 27:04.652
that your friends are dead
and that you're gonna spend

27:04.654 --> 27:06.588
the rest of your God-forsaken
life rotting

27:06.590 --> 27:07.889
in some federal prison?

27:07.891 --> 27:11.860
Muhammed Nazaria is a warrior;
he's a soldier of God,

27:11.862 --> 27:14.295
pursuer of the truth
and the light, okay?

27:14.297 --> 27:15.363
He is the leader!

27:15.365 --> 27:16.965
Leaders lead from the front.

27:16.967 --> 27:18.600
And I don't see him, do you?

27:18.602 --> 27:20.402
Where is he?

27:21.370 --> 27:22.804
Don't you get it, Dawn?

27:22.806 --> 27:24.706
They found you, okay?

27:24.708 --> 27:26.574
Because they look for people
like you.

27:26.576 --> 27:28.343
They look for people who are
vulnerable,

27:28.345 --> 27:30.445
people who
are emotionally fragile,

27:30.447 --> 27:32.747
who have a big wound
on the inside,

27:32.749 --> 27:35.183
who are trying to get back
at somebody for something.

27:35.185 --> 27:38.420
And they make you feel like you're
an important part of something,

27:38.422 --> 27:40.655
a cause...
a cause bigger than you.

27:40.657 --> 27:43.825
So big, in fact, that it's worth
giving your life for.

27:45.895 --> 27:49.664
I am a soldier of Allah, and we
must fight you as you fight us.

27:49.666 --> 27:52.634
Those of us that believe must
fight in the cause of God!

27:52.636 --> 27:54.335
What are you talking about?
These words that

27:54.337 --> 27:57.038
are coming out of your mouth,
they're not even your words!

27:57.040 --> 27:58.873
They're phrases
that have been cherry-picked

27:58.875 --> 28:00.108
from a holy book

28:00.110 --> 28:03.411
and tailored to fit the lies
they've told you.

28:04.780 --> 28:07.048
Listen to me, all right?

28:07.050 --> 28:09.684
I get that it was rough
growing up,

28:09.686 --> 28:12.654
your mom was alcoholic, your old
man, he was never around,

28:12.656 --> 28:15.056
I get it. How old were you
when he died?

28:15.058 --> 28:16.691
You were, like,
eight or nine, right?

28:16.693 --> 28:18.626
I lost my old man, too.

28:18.628 --> 28:20.595
I know what it's like
to lose a parent.

28:20.597 --> 28:23.198
I didn't lose him.

28:23.200 --> 28:27.869
He died, okay? He died fighting
your imperialistic war

28:27.871 --> 28:30.038
against the peaceful
children of Allah!

28:30.040 --> 28:31.673
You're wrong.

28:31.675 --> 28:33.575
Your dad was a hero, okay?

28:33.577 --> 28:35.109
He was a patriot, a soldier

28:35.111 --> 28:36.411
fighting
for his country, Dawn.

28:36.413 --> 28:38.012
You gotta remember him.

28:38.014 --> 28:40.315
What would he make
of all this?

28:40.317 --> 28:42.150
You gotta know,

28:42.152 --> 28:44.385
somewhere inside you,
that this is wrong.

28:44.387 --> 28:46.888
Some shred of regret.

28:48.257 --> 28:51.025
My only regret
is that you stopped me.

28:52.529 --> 28:57.332
Yo... your friend at Quantico's
got something you should see.

28:58.601 --> 29:00.068
All right.

29:13.649 --> 29:16.651
So the FBI matched
the evidence we sent

29:16.653 --> 29:19.120
to two devices used in two
separate bombing incidents.

29:19.122 --> 29:22.390
One of those devices targeted
a U.S. military convoy

29:22.392 --> 29:23.458
traveling down a highway

29:23.460 --> 29:25.093
outside of Kandahar,
in June 2012.

29:40.276 --> 29:42.410
We lost four Marines that day.

29:42.412 --> 29:46.981
There was one survivor,
Marine Sergeant Kirk Emerson.

29:46.983 --> 29:48.716
He survived,
but he lost parts

29:48.718 --> 29:50.618
of both legs and
an arm in the attack.

29:50.620 --> 29:53.254
He's recovering in a
VA Hospital in San Diego.

29:53.256 --> 29:55.456
Now, the IED that was used
was processed by the FBI

29:55.458 --> 29:57.559
as soon as it hit the warehouse,
because it was used

29:57.561 --> 29:59.594
in a fatal attack
on our soldiers.

29:59.596 --> 30:01.296
Right. The components
were too fried,

30:01.298 --> 30:03.364
so couldn't get any
DNA or fingerprints.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.233
Right.

30:05.235 --> 30:07.535
In November of 2012,
an Army EORT recovered

30:07.537 --> 30:10.438
an identical device buried
on the side of the same highway

30:10.440 --> 30:12.273
leading into Kandahar.

30:12.275 --> 30:15.777
That bomb failed to detonate;
it was recovered intact

30:15.779 --> 30:17.612
and then sent to Quantico
for processing.

30:17.614 --> 30:18.846
And?

30:18.848 --> 30:21.015
Well, because it wasn't involved
in a fatal attack,

30:21.017 --> 30:22.283
it was set in backlog,

30:22.285 --> 30:23.985
waiting processing
until right now.

30:23.987 --> 30:25.086
But the FBI thinks

30:25.088 --> 30:27.155
they may have found
some usable prints.

30:29.225 --> 30:31.926
Okay, we got several good lifts
off the device.

30:31.928 --> 30:34.262
We also got a hit
in the immigration database.

30:34.264 --> 30:36.764
Their faces should be showing up
on your screen in a second.

30:36.766 --> 30:39.601
According to TSA, these two
arrived on your island

30:39.603 --> 30:43.871
18 months ago as legal refugees
from Kandahar, Afghanistan.

30:43.873 --> 30:45.740
Hold on. These animals just
walk into our country?

30:45.742 --> 30:47.075
They come through
the front door?

30:47.077 --> 30:49.243
Immigration granted them
refugee status last year.

30:49.245 --> 30:51.412
Well, how does that happen?

30:51.414 --> 30:52.547
Because until you pointed us

30:52.549 --> 30:53.948
in the direction
of that IED in backlog,

30:53.950 --> 30:55.383
we had no evidence linking

30:55.385 --> 30:57.785
these men to any militant
activities or terrorist groups.

30:57.787 --> 31:00.788
They live a couple miles
from the base.

31:04.426 --> 31:06.294
Well, we got the students.

31:06.296 --> 31:07.929
Let's go get the teachers.

31:17.777 --> 31:19.177
Come on, Mika! Go get 'em!

31:19.179 --> 31:20.845
Move your feet, Mika!

31:22.481 --> 31:23.247
Shoot it!

31:24.416 --> 31:25.983
Shoot it!

31:29.288 --> 31:32.290
Yes! Good play!
Excellent play!

31:44.536 --> 31:47.004
Police! Out of the way!

31:48.507 --> 31:49.774
Uday Jahani!

31:49.776 --> 31:51.809
Get down on
the ground!

31:51.811 --> 31:53.477
Get down on the ground now!

31:54.680 --> 31:56.681
Put your hands behind your head.
Turn around.

31:56.683 --> 31:58.950
On your knees.
Turn around.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.322
You're under arrest.

32:08.193 --> 32:10.394
Stand up.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.574
Rahim Ahad!
Get down on your knees!

32:23.576 --> 32:24.976
On your knees!

32:26.878 --> 32:28.646
I said get down!

32:29.381 --> 32:30.381
Hands behind your back.

32:30.383 --> 32:31.749
You're under arrest...

32:31.751 --> 32:34.785
for the murder of four American
servicemen in Afghanistan

32:34.787 --> 32:37.521
and for conspiracy
to commit acts of terror

32:37.523 --> 32:38.856
against the United States
of America.

32:38.858 --> 32:40.157
Get up.

32:45.831 --> 32:47.164
Take a good look.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.434
This is what your last seconds
of freedom look like.

33:16.895 --> 33:19.497
They wanted to stay
loyal to the cause,

33:19.499 --> 33:21.999
but they're nowhere near
as loyal as their star pupil.

33:23.568 --> 33:25.303
You see, these men,
they got families,

33:25.305 --> 33:26.871
they got kids
they want to see again.

33:26.873 --> 33:28.539
So, uh...

33:28.541 --> 33:30.141
they gave everything up.

33:30.143 --> 33:32.343
The plan to bomb
the Air Force base,

33:32.345 --> 33:33.644
the network leading
back to Yemen,

33:33.646 --> 33:34.845
the money trail--

33:34.847 --> 33:37.048
they even gave up
Nazaria's safe house.

33:37.050 --> 33:38.749
It's all over.

33:38.751 --> 33:42.420
The only thing I need
out of you, Dawn...

33:42.422 --> 33:44.255
is why.

33:44.257 --> 33:46.257
I understand why
these guys hate us.

33:46.259 --> 33:47.792
From the day
they were born,

33:47.794 --> 33:50.428
they've been bred to believe
that we are the enemy.

33:50.430 --> 33:51.595
But you...

33:51.597 --> 33:53.364
with the opportunities
and the freedoms

33:53.366 --> 33:55.032
that you were born with,
with the life...

33:55.034 --> 33:56.767
You think you know me.

33:56.769 --> 33:58.769
But you know nothing about me.

33:59.938 --> 34:02.473
I know that your dad was
probably your last chance,

34:02.475 --> 34:04.608
and when he died,
you lost your way.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.746
You're pretty proud of yourself,
aren't you?

34:11.350 --> 34:13.317
Brian and Joseph are dead.

34:13.319 --> 34:16.320
You've got me
in a cage,

34:16.322 --> 34:18.822
wrapped up neatly in a bow.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.025
Do you think
we're the only ones?

34:22.928 --> 34:24.929
We're not.

34:24.931 --> 34:26.364
There are many more like me.

34:26.366 --> 34:28.165
<i>We're your neighbors.</i>

34:28.167 --> 34:30.400
<i>We serve your coffee,</i>

34:30.402 --> 34:32.335
<i>wash your cars...</i>

34:32.338 --> 34:33.971
and we will never stop fighting

34:33.973 --> 34:36.206
until every single person
who walks this earth

34:36.208 --> 34:39.176
accepts Islam
and all the wonders of God.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.478
That's never
gonna happen.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.179
Not in this country, anyway,

34:42.181 --> 34:45.149
because for every one of you,

34:45.150 --> 34:46.516
there's a thousand of me.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.185
And just like you,

34:48.187 --> 34:51.655
we're willing to die
for the cause, too.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.159
And no matter
what you do,

34:55.161 --> 34:57.361
no matter how hard
you come at us,

34:57.363 --> 34:59.163
you will never change
the way we think

34:59.165 --> 35:01.866
and you will never, ever...

35:01.868 --> 35:04.034
change the way we live.

35:05.203 --> 35:07.705
You wanted to sacrifice
your life for the cause, right?

35:07.707 --> 35:09.874
Congratulations.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.745
You just did.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.263
Thank you.

35:32.265 --> 35:34.565
Dawn Hatfield is being
charged with murder

35:34.567 --> 35:37.268
and criminal conspiracy.
She's looking at life-plus.

35:37.270 --> 35:38.769
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer lady.

35:38.771 --> 35:41.439
She'll have plenty of time
to come to her senses.

36:01.694 --> 36:03.227
Do me a favor.
You hear me

36:03.229 --> 36:04.595
complain about my PT ever again,

36:04.597 --> 36:06.263
I want you to punch me
in the head.

36:06.265 --> 36:08.466
Okay.

36:38.463 --> 36:40.498
Good job.

36:43.468 --> 36:44.468
Excuse me.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.737
Kirk Emerson?
That's right.

36:46.739 --> 36:48.105
I'm Steve McGarrett.

36:48.107 --> 36:50.274
This is Danny Williams.
Hey, man.

36:50.276 --> 36:52.510
We're with the Five-O
Task Force in Hawaii.

36:52.512 --> 36:53.744
You are a long way
from home, man.

36:53.746 --> 36:54.945
What can I help you with?

36:54.947 --> 36:56.547
Help us? No, uh...

36:56.549 --> 36:58.516
you've, uh...
you've done enough.

36:58.518 --> 37:00.451
What? This? Nah.

37:00.453 --> 37:03.554
I'm just doing my job, man.

37:03.556 --> 37:05.656
Call it a bad day at the office.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.693
Kirk, we've got
some news for you

37:09.695 --> 37:11.996
that we, uh, we felt you
deserved to hear in person.

37:11.998 --> 37:13.864
Yesterday,
we broke apart

37:13.866 --> 37:16.300
a terror plot
on the island of Oahu.

37:16.302 --> 37:18.636
It was targeting American
soldiers stationed

37:18.638 --> 37:20.271
at Hickam Air Force Base.
I heard about that.

37:20.273 --> 37:21.539
It's been all over the news.

37:21.541 --> 37:24.041
Yeah. Well, we did
withhold some information

37:24.043 --> 37:25.643
'cause we wanted to tell you
something personally.

37:25.645 --> 37:27.478
The two Afghan nationals

37:27.480 --> 37:29.580
that we put away...

37:29.582 --> 37:30.614
they're the same two men

37:30.616 --> 37:32.316
who attacked your convoy
in Afghanistan,

37:32.318 --> 37:34.518
wounded you and
killed your buddies.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.663
You have no idea
what that means.

37:45.665 --> 37:48.265
For you to come all this way
and tell me that in person.

37:48.267 --> 37:50.234
Look, we know it's not gonna
bring your friends back.

37:50.236 --> 37:51.302
We know that.

37:51.304 --> 37:53.270
But... we were hoping

37:53.272 --> 37:54.772
maybe it'd help you
sleep at night

37:54.774 --> 37:58.108
a little better, knowing that
the men responsible are...

37:58.110 --> 38:00.210
they're going to finally pay
for what they did.

38:01.546 --> 38:03.280
How do you say
"thank you" in Hawaiian?

38:03.282 --> 38:04.582
Mahalo.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.320
Mahalo.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.856
Hey.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.425
No thanks necessary.
We're just doing our job.

38:14.427 --> 38:16.527
You can call this one
a good day at the office,

38:16.529 --> 38:18.062
I think, right?

38:20.532 --> 38:21.999
Oorah.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.069
Semper Fi.

38:59.604 --> 39:01.171
Okay, look, this is

39:01.173 --> 39:03.240
my fracture two weeks ago
and this is it today.

39:03.242 --> 39:04.274
See the difference?

39:04.276 --> 39:06.210
Ooh. Nice rack,
bruddah.

39:06.212 --> 39:08.078
What do you mean?

39:08.080 --> 39:10.047
Ribs. Nice.

39:10.049 --> 39:11.582
Oh. Right.

39:11.584 --> 39:13.083
Everything's about
food with you

39:13.085 --> 39:15.419
Not a lot of meat
on that bone though, huh?

39:15.421 --> 39:16.487
So you, too, with the food.

39:16.489 --> 39:17.421
That's... that's odd.

39:17.423 --> 39:18.422
Okay.

39:18.424 --> 39:20.090
If there ever is
a planetary famine,

39:20.092 --> 39:21.959
please remind me
not to be near these two.

39:24.063 --> 39:25.596
Hey...

39:25.598 --> 39:27.097
thanks a lot for inviting me.

39:27.099 --> 39:28.465
Hey!

39:28.467 --> 39:30.067
Yeah, um...

39:30.069 --> 39:31.835
Pua, you know this is
not a date, right?

39:31.837 --> 39:33.103
We're just friends.

39:33.105 --> 39:34.838
That's cool.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.174
Uh, I mean I was
wondering if you had a cousin...

39:37.176 --> 39:40.944
you know, someone who
kind of looks like you?

39:40.946 --> 39:43.280
Exactly like you?

39:43.282 --> 39:44.381
No.

39:44.383 --> 39:45.349
I don't, Pua.

39:45.351 --> 39:46.784
Or-or anyone will do.

39:51.122 --> 39:52.189
Enjoy.

39:52.191 --> 39:53.857
Mmm! Have mercy.

39:53.859 --> 39:54.958
Will you look

39:54.960 --> 39:57.561
at my fish? Mm-hmm!

39:57.563 --> 39:58.796
She sure does clean up nice,
don't she?

39:58.798 --> 40:00.230
She sure does.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.066
Well, uh, listen,
ladies and gentlemen,

40:02.068 --> 40:04.668
before we dig in,
I'd just like to take the time

40:04.670 --> 40:08.338
to say a few words
about my, uh...

40:08.340 --> 40:09.306
worthy opponent.

40:09.308 --> 40:10.574
Here we go.

40:10.576 --> 40:11.775
To become

40:11.777 --> 40:14.478
so strong and mighty,

40:14.480 --> 40:15.813
you spent many years

40:15.815 --> 40:18.582
in the depths
of the ocean,

40:18.584 --> 40:20.417
avoiding the nets
of the trawlers,

40:20.419 --> 40:21.685
dodging the fisherman's spear...

40:21.687 --> 40:22.986
Did you write this?

40:22.988 --> 40:24.655
No, this is all him.

40:24.657 --> 40:25.723
That's good, I like it.
Keep going.

40:25.725 --> 40:27.524
You were not one to be fooled

40:27.526 --> 40:29.593
by the baited hook

40:29.595 --> 40:31.795
or by shiny lure,
oh, no.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.397
You knew no fear,

40:33.399 --> 40:35.432
for you were
king of the sea...

40:35.434 --> 40:38.068
that is, until that
fateful moment yesterday,

40:38.070 --> 40:39.570
when you swam

40:39.572 --> 40:40.738
around that reef
and found

40:40.740 --> 40:44.074
yourself looking
deeply into the eyes...

40:44.076 --> 40:45.409
of a mighty warrior.

40:45.411 --> 40:47.911
Stop. Stop there.

40:47.913 --> 40:48.812
We're done, we're bored,
we're hungry.

40:48.814 --> 40:49.947
Pass the damn fish

40:49.949 --> 40:51.381
around the table.
I'm not bored.

40:52.550 --> 40:53.650
Fine, fine.

40:53.652 --> 40:54.651
Let's eat.
Let me get a little

40:54.653 --> 40:56.386
of this first...
I got it.

40:56.388 --> 40:58.922
Ooh! Mmm!

40:58.924 --> 41:00.190
It's like liquid.
It's just...

41:00.192 --> 41:02.426
just-just melts
in your mouth.

41:02.428 --> 41:03.927
I just... Mmm!

41:03.929 --> 41:05.162
There-- move that
around in your mouth.

41:05.164 --> 41:06.196
How you like that?

41:06.198 --> 41:08.265
How's that taste?
You know what?

41:09.334 --> 41:12.002
It tastes like a suicidal fish

41:12.004 --> 41:13.971
who gave his life
to pump up your ego.

41:13.973 --> 41:15.572
Yeah, you're just
gonna keep right on

41:15.574 --> 41:17.207
flogging that dead horse.

41:17.209 --> 41:18.742
I'm just keeping it real, man.
Real?

41:18.744 --> 41:20.177
Let me tell you what's real,
partner.

41:20.179 --> 41:22.079
You, me, fish-off.

41:22.081 --> 41:23.680
This weekend.

41:23.682 --> 41:25.983
Biggest catch wins.

41:25.985 --> 41:26.917
Thank you.

41:26.919 --> 41:28.352
Anyone want to take
the action here?

41:28.354 --> 41:29.286
Who? Who?

41:29.288 --> 41:30.587
I'm holding the book.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.389
I got McGarrett
opening at two to one...

41:32.391 --> 41:33.590
What?
...based on

41:33.592 --> 41:35.726
experience and
local knowledge.

41:35.728 --> 41:36.894
All right.

41:36.896 --> 41:38.762
I'll take, uh,
I'll take Grover for $20.

41:38.764 --> 41:40.063
- Just because.
- Good.

41:40.065 --> 41:41.498
No?

41:41.500 --> 41:42.800
All right,
I'll take Grover for $40.

41:42.802 --> 41:44.001
Ow!

41:44.003 --> 41:46.370
So what's it gonna be?

41:54.112 --> 41:55.345
You're on.
